leave
the

little
to
say
further
,
than
that
he
accept
that
success
and
its
result
as
gratefully
as
it
be
possible
for
any
one
to
do
popular
favour

<EOS>
a
belief
in
the
existence
of

first
take
its
rise
in
Norway
and
Sweden
,
from
whence
it
rapidly
spread
to
more
southern

,
take
a
firm
hold
of
the
imagination
of
the
more
credulous
portion
of
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
the
follow
romance
be
collect
from
seemingly
the
most
authentic
source
,
and
the
author
must
leave
the
question
of
credibility
entirely
to
his

,
not
even
think
that
he
be
peculiarly

upon
to
express
his
own
opinion
upon
the
subject

<EOS>
nothing
have
be
omit
in
the
life
of
the
unhappy
Varney
,
which
could
tend
to
throw
a
light
upon
his
most
extraordinary
career
,
and
the
fact
of
his
death
just
as
it
be
here
relate
,

a
great
noise
at
the

through
Europe
and
be
to

with
these
few
observation

be
well
content

stamp
it
with
an
approbation
far
exceed
their
most
sanguine
expectation
,

which
be
calculate

strong
possible
incentive
to

the
solemn
tone
of
an
old
cathedral
clock
have
announce
midnight
--
the
air
be
thick
and
heavy
--
a
strange
,
death
like
stillness
pervade
all
nature

<EOS>
like
the
ominous
calm
which
precede
some
more
than
usually
terrific
outbreak
of
the
element
,
they
seem
to
have
pause
even
in
their
ordinary
fluctuation
,
to
gather
a
terrific
strength
for
the
great
effort
.
<EOS>
a
faint
peal

scatter
many
of

hot
blast
of

terrific
breath

as
suddenly

that
blast
of
wind
have
come

cease

all
be
as
still

that
what
they

the

chimera
of
a
dream

They
tremble
and
turn
to
sleep
again

all
be
still
--
still
as
the
very
grave

not
a

break
the
magic
of

<EOS>
what
be
that
--
a
strange
,
patter

,
as
of

It
be

yes

with
a
pale

a
stately

and
a
strange

which

to
the
Elizabethan

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
God

<EOS>
how

like
an
occasional
discharge
of
mimic
musketry

clash
,
beat

and
crack
upon
the
small
pane
;
but
they
resist

the
wind

of
loveliness

a
half
sleep
upon

ancient

--
a
girl
young
and
beautiful
as
a
spring

.
<EOS>
Her
long
hair

from
its
confinement
and

the
blacken
covering

bedstead

near

<EOS>

the
rare
sculptor

<EOS>
She

slightly
in
her
sleep

and

at

of
Him

<EOS>
She

awaken
her
;
but
it
can
disturb
the
slumber
it

although

pearly

bay
window

<EOS>
how

long
silken
eyelash

upon
the
cheek

<EOS>
now

and
one
shoulder

<EOS>
whiter

<EOS>
be
that
lightning

<EOS>
yes

an
awful

vivid

terrifying

peal

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
now

that
beautiful
girl
on
the
antique
bed
;
she
open
those
eye
of
celestial
blue

and
a
faint
cry
of
alarm
burst
from
her
lip
.
<EOS>
at

it
be
a
cry
which
,
amid
the
noise
and
turmoil
without

sound
but
faint
and
weak

<EOS>
She

upon
the
bed
and
press
her

upon
her
eye
.
<EOS>
Heavens

<EOS>
what

and
hail

<EOS>
the
thunder

seem
intent
upon
awaken
sufficient
echo
to
last
until
the
next
flash
of
forked
lightning
should
again
produce
the
wild
concussion
of
the
air
.
<EOS>
She
murmur
a
prayer
--
a
prayer
for
those
she
love
best
;
the
name
of
those
dear
to
her
gentle
heart
come
from
her
lip
;
she
weep
and
pray
<EOS>
;
she
think
then
of
what
devastation
the
storm
must
surely
produce
,
and
to
the
great
God
of
Heaven
<EOS>
she
pray
for
all
live

<EOS>
another

across
that
bay
window

for
an
instant
bring
out
every
colour
in
it
with
terrible
distinctness
.
<EOS>
a
shriek
burst
from
the
lip
of
the
young
girl
,
and
then

with
eye
fix
upon
that
window

which

in
another
moment

and
with
such
an
expression

terror
upon
her

<EOS>

<EOS>
a

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
It

the
whole
length
of
the
window

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
there

a
lull
of
the
wind

<EOS>
the
hail

so
thickly
--
moreover

what
there

straight

and
yet
a
strange
clattering
sound
come
upon
the
glass
of
that
long
window
.
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
a
delusion
--
she
be
awake
,
and
she
hear
it
.
<EOS>
what
can
produce
it
?
<EOS>
another
flash
of
lightning
--
another
shriek
<EOS>
--
there
could
be
now
no
delusion
.
 
<EOS>
a
tall
figure
be
stand
on
the
ledge
immediately
outside
the
long
window
.
<EOS>
It
be
its
finger
-
nail
upon
the
glass
that

the
sound
so
like
the
hail

now
that
the
hail

<EOS>
intense
fear
paralyse
the
limb
of
that
beautiful
girl
.
<EOS>
that
one
shriek
be
all
she
can
utter
--
with
hand
clasp
,
a
face
of
marble
,
a
heart
beat
so
wildly
in
her
bosom
,
that
each
moment
it
seem
as
if
it
would
break
its
confine
,
eye
distend
and
fix
upon
the
window
<EOS>

with
horror

<EOS>
the
pattering
and
clattering
of
the
nail
continue
.
<EOS>
no
word
be
speak
,
and
now
she
fancy
she
can
trace
the
dark
form
of
that
figure
against
the
window
,
and
she
can
see
the
long
arm
move
to
and
fro
,
feel
for
some
mode
of
entrance
.
<EOS>
what
strange
light
be
that
which
now
gradually
creep
up
into
the
air
?
<EOS>
red
and
terrible
--
bright
and
bright
it
grow
.
<EOS>
the
lightning
have
set
fire
to
a
mill
,
and
the
reflection
of
the
rapidly
consume
building
fall
upon
that
long
window
.
<EOS>
there
can
be
no
mistake
.
<EOS>
the
figure
be
there
,
still
feel
for
an
entrance
,
and
clatter
against
the
glass
with
its
long
nail
,
that
appear
as
if
the
growth
of
many
year
have
be
untouched

<EOS>
She
try
to
scream
again
but
a
choke
sensation
come
over
her
,
and
she
can
not

<EOS>
It
be
too
dreadful
--
she
try
to
move
--
each
limb
seem
weigh
down
by
ton
of
lead
--
she
can
but
in
a
hoarse
faint
whisper
cry,--
 
"
help

help
--
help
--
help

"
 
<EOS>
and
that
one
word
she
repeat
like
a
person
in
a
dream
.
<EOS>
the
red
glare
of
the
fire
continue
.
<EOS>
It
throw
up
the
tall
gaunt
figure
in
hideous
relief
against
the
long
window
.
<EOS>
It
show
,
too
,
upon
the
one
portrait
that
be
in
the
chamber
,
and
that
portrait
appear
to
fix
its
eye
upon
the
attempt
intruder
,
while
the
flickering
light
from
the
fire
make
it
look
fearfully
life
-
like
.
<EOS>
a
small
pane
of
glass
be
break
,
and
the
form
from
without
introduce
a
long
gaunt
hand
,
which
seem
utterly
destitute
of
flesh
.
<EOS>
the
fastening
be
remove
,
and
one

half
of
the
window
,
which
open
like
fold
door
,
be
swung
wide
open
upon
its
hinge
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
now
she
could
not
scream
--
she
could
not
move
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
help!--help!--help
!
<EOS>
"
be
all
she
could
say
.
<EOS>
but
,
oh
,
that
look
of
terror
that
sit
upon
her
face
,
it
be
dreadful
--
a
look
to
haunt
the
memory
for
a
lifetime
--
a
look
to
obtrude
itself
upon
the
happy
moment
,
and
turn
them
to
bitterness
.
 
<EOS>
the
figure
turn
half
round
,
and
the
light
fall
upon
the
face
.
<EOS>
It
be
perfectly
white
--
perfectly
bloodless
.
<EOS>
the
eye
look
like
polished
tin
;
the
lip
be
draw
back
,
and
the
principal
feature
next
to
those
dreadful
eye
be
the
tooth
--
the
fearful
looking
tooth
--
project
like
those
of
some
wild
animal
,
hideously
,
glaringly
white
,
and
fang

<EOS>
It
approach
the
bed
with
a
strange
,
glide
movement
.
<EOS>
It
clash
together
the
long
nail
that
literally
appear
to
hang
from
the
finger
end
.
<EOS>
no
sound
come
from
its
lip
.
<EOS>
be
she
go
mad
--
that
young
and
beautiful
girl
expose
to
so
much
terror
?
<EOS>
she
have
draw
up
all
her
limb
;
she
can
not
even
now
say
help
.
<EOS>
the
power
of
articulation
be
go
,
but
the
power
of
movement
have
return
to
her
;
she
can
draw
herself
slowly
along
to
the
other
side
of
the
bed
from
that
towards
which
the
hideous
appearance
be
come
.
 
<EOS>
but
her
eye
be
fascinate
.
<EOS>
the
glance
of
a
serpent
could
not
have
produce
a
great
effect
upon
her
than
do
the
fix
gaze
of
those
awful
,
metallic

look
eye
that
be
bent
on
her
face
.
<EOS>
crouch
down
so
that
the
gigantic
height
be
lose

and
the
horrible
,
protrude
,
white
face
be
the
most
prominent
object
,
come
on
the
figure
.
<EOS>
what
be
it?--what
do
it
want
there?--what
make
it
look
so
hideous
--
so
unlike
an
inhabitant
of
the
earth
,
and
yet
to
be
on
it
?
 
<EOS>
now
she
have
get
to
the
verge
of
the
bed
,
and
the
figure
pause
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
when
it
pause
she
lose
the
power
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
the
clothing
of
the
bed

now
clutch
in
her
hand
with
unconscious
power
.
<EOS>
She

her
breath
short
and
thick

<EOS>
Her

and
her
limb

He

.
<EOS>
the
wind

hush
;
the
church
clock

the
hour
of
one
:
a
hiss
sound
come
from
the
throat
of
the
hideous
being
,
and

long
,
gaunt
arm
--

<EOS>
He

.
<EOS>

<EOS>
She

that
direction
--
can

it
?
<EOS>
have
she
power
to
walk?--can
<EOS>
she
withdraw
her
eye
from
the
face
of
the
intruder
,
and
so
break
the
hideous
charm
?
<EOS>
God
of
Heaven
!
<EOS>
be
it
real
,
or
some
dream
so
like
reality
as
to
nearly
overturn
the
judgment
for

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
as
she

along
she

stream
across
the
pillow

<EOS>
the
pause
last
about
a
minute
--
<EOS>
oh

what
an
age
of
agony
.
<EOS>
that
minute
be
,
indeed
,
enough
for
madness
to
do
its
full
work
in
.
 
<EOS>
with
a
sudden
rush
that
could
not
be
foresee
--
with
a
strange
howling
cry
that
be
enough
to
awaken
terror
in
every
breast
,

the
long
tress
of
her
hair

and
twine

round
his
bony
hand
he

<EOS>
then

Her
beautifully

her
soul

<EOS>
the
glassy

with
a
hideous
satisfaction
--
horrible
profanation

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
He

a
loud
snap
--
it
be
a
part
of
the
lock,--and
<EOS>
the
door
at
once
swing
wide
open
.
 
<EOS>
how
true
it
be
that
we
measure
time
by
the
event
which
happen
within
a
give
space
of
it
,
rather
than
by
its
actual
duration

<EOS>
to
those
who
be
engage
in
force
open
the
door
of
the
antique
chamber

where
sleep
the
young

each
moment
be
swell
into
an
hour
of
agony

but
,
in
reality

from
the
first
moment
of
the
alarm
to
that
when
the
loud
crack
noise
herald
the
destruction
of

<EOS>
"

as
he
speak
,
he
succeed
in
throw
the
massive
door
wide
open
,
and
clear
the
passage
to
the
chamber

<EOS>
to
rush
in
with
a
light
in
his
hand
be
the
work
of
a
moment
to
the
young
man

Henry
;
but
the
very
rapid
progress
he
make
into
the
apartment
prevent
him
from

for

and
although

"
Flora

<EOS>
he
cry
.
 
<EOS>
then
with
a
sudden
bind
something
dash
from
off
the
bed
.
<EOS>
the
concussion
against
him
be
so
sudden
and
so
utterly
unexpected
,
as
well
as
so
tremendously
violent
,
that
he
be
throw
down
,
and
,
in
his
fall
,
the
light
be
fairly
extinguish
.
 
<EOS>
all
be
darkness
,
save
a
dull
,
reddish
kind
of
light
that
now
and
then
,
from
the
nearly
consume
mill
in
the
immediate
vicinity
,
come
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
but
by
that
light
,
dim
,
uncertain
,
and
flicker
as
it
be
,
some
one
be
see
to
make
for
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
,
although
nearly
stun
by
his
fall
,
see
a
figure
,
gigantic
in
height
,
which
nearly
reach
from
the
floor
to
the
ceiling
.
<EOS>
the
other
young
man
,
George
,
see
it
,
and
Mr.
Marchdale
likewise
see
it
,
as
do
the
lady
who
have
speak
to
the
two
young
man
in
the
corridor
when
first
the
scream
of
the
young
girl
awaken
alarm
in
the
breast
of
all
the
inhabitant
of
that
house
.
 
<EOS>
the
figure
be
about
to
pass
out
at
the
window
which
lead
to
a
kind
of
balcony
,
<EOS>
from
whence
there
be
an
easy
descent
to
a
garden
.
 
<EOS>
before
it
pass
out
they
each
and
all
catch
a
glance
of
the
side
-
face
,
and
they
see
that
the
low
part
of
it
and
the
lip
be
dabble
in
blood
.
<EOS>
They
see
,
too
,
one
of
those
fearful
-
look
,
shine
,
metallic
eye
which
present
so
terrible
an
appearance
of
unearthly
ferocity
.
 
<EOS>
no
wonder
that
for
a
moment
a
panic
seize
them
all
,
which
paralyse
any
exertion
they
may
otherwise
have
make
to
detain
that
hideous
form
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Marchdale
be
a
man
of
mature
year
;
he
have
see
much
of
life
,
both
in
this
and
in
foreign
land
;
and
he
,
although
astonish
to
the
extent
of
be
frightened
,
be
much
more
likely
to
recover
sooner
than
his
young
companion
,
which
,
indeed
,
he
do
,
and
act
promptly
enough
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
rise
,
Henry
,
"
he
cry
.
<EOS>
"
lie
still
.
"
 
<EOS>
almost
at
the
moment
he
utter
these
word
,
he
fire
at
the
figure
,
which
then
occupy
the
window
,
as
if
it
be
a
gigantic
figure
set
in
a
frame
.
 
<EOS>
the
report
be
tremendous
in
that
chamber
,
for
the
pistol
<EOS>
be
no
toy
weapon
,
but
one
make
for
actual
service
,
and
of
sufficient
length
and
bore
of
barrel
to
carry
destruction
along
with
the
bullet
that
come
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
that
have
miss
its
aim
,
"
say
Mr.
Marchdale
,
"
I
will
never
pull
a
trigger
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
as
he
speak
he
dash
forward
,
and
make
a
clutch
at
the
figure
he
feel
convinced
he
have
shoot
.
 
<EOS>
the
tall
form
turn
upon
him
,
and
when
he
get
a
full
view
of
the
face
,
which
he
do
at
that
moment
,
from
the
opportune
circumstance
of
the
lady
return
at
the
instant
with
a
light
she
have
be
to
her
own
chamber
to
procure
,
even
he
,
Marchdale
,
with
all
his
courage
,
and
that
be
great
,
and
all
his
nervous
energy
,
recoil
a
step
or
two
,
and
utter
the
exclamation
of
,
"
Great
God
!
"
 
<EOS>
that
face
be
one
never
to
be
forget
.
<EOS>
It
be
hideously
flush
with
colour
--
the
colour
of
fresh
blood
;
the
eye
have
a
savage
and
remarkable
lustre
;
whereas
,
before
,
they
have
look
like
polished
tin
--
they
now
wear
a
ten
time
bright
aspect
,
and
flash
of
light
seem
to
dart
from
them
.
<EOS>
the
mouth
be
open
,
as
if
,
from
the
natural
formation
of
the
countenance
,
the
lip
recede
much
from
the
large
canine
look
tooth
.
 
<EOS>
a
strange
howling
noise
come
from
the
throat
of
this
monstrous
figure
,
and
it
seem
upon
the
point
of
rush
upon
Mr.
Marchdale
.
<EOS>
suddenly
,
then
,
as
if
some
impulse
have
seize
upon
it
,
it
utter
a
wild
and
terrible
shrieking
kind
of
laugh
;
and
then
turn
,
dash
through
the
window
,
and
in
one
instant
disappear
from
before
the
eye
of
those
who
feel
nearly
annihilate
by
its
fearful
presence
.
 
<EOS>
"
God
help
us
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculate
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Marchdale
draw
a
long
breath
,
and
then
,
give
a
stamp
on
the
floor
,
as
if
to
recover
himself
from
the
state
of
agitation
into
which
even
he
be
throw
,
he
cried,--
 
<EOS>
"
be
it
what
or
<EOS>
who
it
may
<EOS>
,
I
will
follow
it
"
 
"
no
<EOS>
--

--
do
not

"
cry
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
let
who
will
come
with
me
--
I
follow
that
dreadful
form
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
he
speak
,
he
take
the
road
it
take
,
and
dash
through
the
window
into
the
balcony
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
we
,
too
,
George
,
"
exclaim
Henry
;
"
we
will
follow
Mr.
Marchdale
.
<EOS>
this
dreadful
affair
concern
us
more
nearly
than
it
do
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
lady
who
be
the
mother
of
these
young
man
,
and
of
the
beautiful
girl
who
have
be
so
awfully
visit
,
scream
aloud
,
and
implore
of
them
to
stay
.
<EOS>
but
the
voice
of
Mr.
Marchdale
be
hear
exclaim
aloud,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
--
I
see
it
;
it
make
for
the
wall
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
hesitate
no
longer
,
but
at
once
rush
into
the
balcony
,
and
from
thence
drop
into
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
the
mother
approach
the
bed
-
side
of
the
insensible
,
perhaps
the
murder
girl
;
she
see
her
,
to
all
appearance
,
welter
in
blood
,
and
,
overcome
by
her
emotion
,
she
faint
on
the
floor
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
two
young
man
reach
the
garden
,
they
find
it
much
light
than
may
have
be
fairly
expect
;
for
not
only
be
the
morning
rapidly
approach
,
but
the
mill
be
still
burn
,
and
those
mingle
light
make
almost
every
object
plainly
visible
,
except
when
deep
shadow
be
throw
from
some
gigantic
tree
that
have
stand
for
century
in
that
sweetly
woode
spot
.
<EOS>
They
hear
the
voice
of
Mr.
Marchdale
,
as
he
cried,--
 
<EOS>
"
there
--
there
--
towards
the
wall
.
<EOS>
there
--
there
--
God
!
<EOS>
how
it
bound
along
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
young
man
hastily
dash
through
a
thicket
in
the
direction
from
whence
his
voice
sound
,
and
then
they
find
him
look
wild
and
terrified
,
and
with
something
in
his
hand
which
look
like
a
portion
of
clothing
.
 
<EOS>
"
which
way
,
which
way
?
<EOS>
"
they
both
cry
in
a
breath
.
 
<EOS>
He
lean
heavily
on
the
arm
of
George
,
as
he
point
along
a
vista
of
tree
,
and
say
in
a
low
voice,--
 
<EOS>
"
God
help
us
all
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
human
.
<EOS>
look
there
--
look
there
--
do
you
not
see
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
They
look
in
the
direction
he
indicate
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
this
vista
be
the
wall
of
the
garden
.
<EOS>
at
that
point
it
be
full
twelve
foot
in
height
,
and
as
they
look
,
they
see
the
hideous
,
monstrous
form
they
have
trace
from
the
chamber
of
their
sister
,
make
frantic
effort
to
clear
the
obstacle
.
 
<EOS>
then
they
see
it
bind
from
the
ground
to
the
top
of
the
wall
,
which
it
very
nearly
reach
,
and
then
each
time
it
fall
back
again
into
the
garden
with
such
a
dull
,
heavy
sound
,
that
the
earth
seem
to
shake
again
with
the
concussion
.
<EOS>
They
tremble
--
well
indeed
they
may
,
and
for
some
minute
they
watch
the
figure
make
its
fruitless
effort
to
leave
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
--
what
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
whisper
Henry
,
in
hoarse
accent
.
<EOS>
"
God
,
what
can
it
possibly
be
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
,
"
reply
Mr.
Marchdale
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
seize
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
cold
and
clammy
like
a
corpse
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
human
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
human
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
look
at
it
now

<EOS>
It
will
surely
escape
now

"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
--
we
will
not
be
terrify
thus
--
there
be
Heaven
above
us

<EOS>
come
on
,
and
,
for
dear
Flora
's
sake
,
let
us
make
an
effort
yet
to
seize
this
bold
intruder
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
take
this
pistol
,
"
say
Marchdale
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
fellow
of
the
one
I
fire

<EOS>
try
its
efficacy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
will
be
go
,
"
exclaim
Henry
,
as
at
this
moment
,
after
many
repeat
attempt
and
fearful
fall
,
the
figure
reach
the
top
of
the
wall
,
and
then
hang
by
its
long
arm
a
moment
or
two
,
previous
to
drag
itself
completely
up
.
 
<EOS>
the
idea
of
the
appearance
,
be
it
what
it
may
,
entirely
escape
,
seem
to
nerve
again
Mr.
Marchdale
,
and
he
,
as
well
as
the
two
young
man
,
run
forward
towards
the
wall
.
<EOS>
They
get
so
close
to
the
figure
before
it
spring
down
on
the
outer
side
of
the
wall
,
that
to
miss
kill
it
with
the
bullet
from
the
pistol
<EOS>
be
a
matter
of
utter
impossibility
,
unless
wilfully
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
have
the
weapon
,
and
he
point
it
full
at
the
tall
form
with
a
steady
aim
.
<EOS>
He
pull
the
trigger
--
the
explosion
follow
,
and
that
the
bullet
do
its
office
there
could
be
no
manner
of
doubt
,
for
the
figure
give
a
howl
shriek
,
and
fall
headlong
from
the
wall
on
the
outside
.
 
<EOS>
"
I

Henry

I

"
<EOS>
He
be
human
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Henry
;
"
I
have
surely
kill
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
seem
so
,
"
say
Mr.
Marchdale
.
<EOS>
"
let
us
now
hurry
round
to
the
outside
of
the
wall
,
and
see
where
he
lie
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
at
once
agree
to
,
and
the
whole
three
of
them
make
what
expedition
they
could
towards
a
gate
which
lead
into
a
paddock
,
across
which
they
hurry
,
and
soon
find
themselves
clear
of
the
garden
wall
,
so
that
they
could
make
way
towards
where
they
fully
expect
to
find
the
body
of
him
who
have
wear
so
unearthly
an
aspect
,
but
who
it
would
be
an
excessive
relief
to
find
be
human
.
 
<EOS>
so
hurried
be
the
progress
they
make
,
that
it
be
scarcely
possible
to
exchange
many
word
as
they
go
;
a
kind
of
breathless
anxiety
be
upon
them
,
and
in
the
speed
they
disregard
every
obstacle
,
which
would
,
at
any
other
time
,
have
probably
prevent
them
from
take
the
direct
road
they
seek
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
difficult
on
the
outside
of
the
wall
to
say
exactly
which
be
the
precise
spot
which
it
may
be
suppose
<EOS>
the
body
have
fall
on
;
but
,
by
follow
the
wall
in
its
entire
length
,
surely
they
would
come
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
do
so
;
but
,
to
their
surprise
,
they
get
from
its
commencement
to
its
further
extremity
without
find
any
dead
body
,
or
even
any
symptom
of
one
have
lain
there
.
 
<EOS>
at
some
part
close
to
the
wall
there
grow
a
kind
of
heath
,
and
,
consequently
,
the
trace
of
blood
would
be
lose
among
it
,
if
it
so
happen
that
at
the
precise
spot
at
which
the
strange
being
have
seem
to
topple
over
,
such
vegetation
have
exist
.
<EOS>
this
be
to
be
ascertain
;
but
now
,
after
traverse
the
whole
length
of
the
wall
twice
,
they
come
to
a
halt
,
and
look
wonderingly
in
each
other
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
here
,
"
say
Harry
.
 
<EOS>
"
nothing
,
"
add
his
brother
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
could
not
have
be
a
delusion
,
"
at
length
say
Mr.
Marchdale
,
with
a
shudder
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
delusion
?
<EOS>
"
exclaim
the
brother
!
"
<EOS>
that
be
not
possible
;
we
all
see
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
what
terrible
explanation
can
we
give
?
"
 
"
<EOS>
by
heaven
!
<EOS>
I
know
not
,
"
exclaim
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
adventure
surpass
all
belief
,
and
but
for
the
great
interest
we
have
in
it
,
I
should
regard
it
with
a
world
of
curiosity
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
too
dreadful
,
"
say
George
;
"
<EOS>
for
God
's
sake
,
Henry
,
let
us
return
to
ascertain
if
poor
Flora
be
kill
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
sense
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
be
all
so
much
absorb
in
gaze
at
that
horrible
form
,
that
I
never
once
look
towards
her
further
than
to
see
that
she
be
,
to
appearance
,
dead
.
<EOS>
God
help
her
!
<EOS>
poor
--
poor
,
beautiful
Flora
.
<EOS>
this
be
,
indeed
,
a
sad
,
sad
fate
for
you
to
come
to

<EOS>
Flora
--
flora--
"
 
"
do
not
weep
,
Henry
,
"
say
George
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
rather
let
us
now
hasten
home
,
where
we
may
find
that
tear
be
premature
.
<EOS>
She
may
yet
be
live
and
restore
to
us
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
,
"
say
Mr.
Marchdale
,
"
she
may
be
able
to
give
us
some
account
of
this
dreadful
visitation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
true
--
true
,
"
exclaim
Henry
;
"
we
will
hasten
home
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
now
turn
their
step
homeward
,
and
as
they
go
they
much
blame
themselves
for
all
leave
home
together
,
and
with
terror
picture
what
may
occur
in
their
absence
to
those
who
be
now
totally
unprotected
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
rash
impulse
of
us
all
to
come
in
pursuit
of
this
dreadful
figure
,
"
remark
Mr.
Marchdale
;
"
but
do
not
torment
yourself
,
Henry
.
<EOS>
there
may
be
no
reason
for
your
fear
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
the
pace
they
go
,
they
very
soon
reach
the
ancient
house
,
and
when
they
come
in
sight
of
it
,
they
see
light
flash
from
the
window
,
and
the
shadow
of
face
move
to
and
fro
,
indicate
that
the
whole
household
be
up
,
and
in
a
state
of
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
,
after
some
trouble
,
get
the
hall
door
open
by
a
terrified
servant
,
who
be
tremble
so
much
that
she
could
scarcely
hold
the
light
she
have
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
"

Henry

<EOS>
"

"
 
<EOS>
"
yes

"

<EOS>
thank
God
she
live

where

"
 
<EOS>
"
in
her
own
room
,
Master
Henry
.
<EOS>
oh
,
dear
--
<EOS>
oh
,

,
what
will
become
of
us
all
?
"
 
<EOS>
Henry
rush
up
the
staircase
,
follow
by
George
and
Mr.
Marchdale
,
nor
pause
he
once
until
he
reach
the
room
of
his
sister
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
"
he
say
,
before
he
cross
the
threshold
,
"
be

"
 
<EOS>
"
I

my

<EOS>
"

Mr.

"
say
Henry--"come

we
make
no

"
 
<EOS>
They
all
then
enter
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
several
light
have
be
now
bring
into
that
antique
chamber
,
and
,
in
addition
to
the
mother
of
the
beautiful
girl
who
have
be
so
fearfully
visit
,
there
be
two
female
domestic
,
who
appear
to
be
in
the
great
possible
fright
,
for
they
could
render
no
assistance
whatever
to
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
the
tear
be
stream
down
the
mother
's
face
,
and
the
moment
she
see
Mr.
Marchdale
,
she
cling
to
his
arm
,
evidently
unconscious
of
what
she
be
about
,
and
exclaimed,--
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
what
be
this
that
have
happen
--
what
be
this
?
<EOS>
tell
me
,

Robert
Marchdale

me

me
the

of
all
this

<EOS>
"
I
can
not

"
he
say
,
in
a
tone
of
much
emotion
.
<EOS>
"
as
God
be
my
judge
,
I
be
as
much
puzzle
and
amazed
at
the
scene
that
have
take
place
here
to
-
night
as
you
can
be

"
 
<EOS>
the
mother
wring
her
hand
and
weep
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
storm
that
first
awaken
me
,
"
add
Marchdale
;
"
and
then
I
hear
a
scream
.

"
 
<EOS>
the
brother
tremblingly
approach
the
bed
.

Flora

in
a
sit

reclining
posture

She

be
fearfully
pale

while

very
faintly

<EOS>
on
some
of
her
clothing
,
about
the
neck
,
be
spot
of
blood
,
and
she
look
more
like
one
who
have
suffer
some
long
and
grievous
illness
,
than
a
young
girl
in
the
prime
of
life
and
in
the
most
robust
health
,
as
she
have
be
on
the
day
previous
to
the
strange
scene
we
have
record

<EOS>
"
do
she
sleep

"
say
Henry
,
as
a
tear
fall
from
his
eye
upon
her
pallid
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
"
no

"
reply
Mr.
Marchdale
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
swoon

to
restore
the
languid

and
,
after
persevere
in
them
for
some
time

they
have
the
satisfaction
of

her
open
her
eye

<EOS>
Her
first
act
upon
consciousness
return
,
however
,
be
to
utter
a
loud
shriek
,
and
it
be
not
until
Henry
implore
her
to
look
around
her
,
and
see
that
she
be
surround
by
none
but
friendly
face
,
that
she
would
venture
again
to
open
her
eye
,
and
look
timidly
from
one
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
then
she
shudder
,
and
burst
into
tear
as
she
said,--
 
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
there

Mr.

a
light
close
to
the
bed
,
where
all
see
on
the
side
of
Flora
's
neck
a
small
punctured
wound
;
or
,
rather
two
,
for
there
be
one
a
little
distance
from
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
from
these
wound
the
blood
have
come
which
be
observable
upon
her
night
clothing
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
come
these
wound
?
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
she
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
very
faint
and
weak
,
as
if
I
have
almost
bleed
to
death
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
have
do
so
,
dear
Flora
,
for
there
be
not
above
<EOS>
half
-
a
-
dozen
spot
of
blood
to
be
see
at
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Marchdale
lean
against
the
carved
head
of
the
bed
for
support
,
and
he
utter
a
deep
groan
.
<EOS>
all
eye
be
turn
upon
him
,
and
Henry
say
,
in
a
voice
of
the
most
anxious
inquiry,--
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
something
to
say
,
Mr.
Marchdale
,
which
will
throw
some
light
upon
this
affair
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
no
,
nothing
!
"
cry
Mr.
Marchdale
,
rouse
himself
at
once
from
the
appearance
of
depression
that
have
come
over
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
to
say
,
but
that
I
think
Flora
have
better
get
some
sleep
if
she
can
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
sleep
-
no
sleep
for
me
,
"
again
scream
Flora
.
<EOS>
"
dare
I
be
alone
to
sleep
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
you
shall
not
be
alone
,
dear
Flora
,
"
say
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
sit
by
your
bedside
and
watch
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
take
his
hand
in
both
her
,
and
while
the
tear
chase
each
other
down
her
cheek
,
she
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
promise
me
,
Henry

by
all
your
hope
of
Heaven

,
you
will
not
leave

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
promise

"
 
<EOS>
She
gently
lay
herself
down
,
with
a
deep
sigh
,
and
close
her
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
weak
,
and
will
sleep
long

Mr.
Marchdale

<EOS>
"
You

Henry

some
fearful

"
Hush

Mr.

<EOS>
"

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
understand
,
"
say
Henry

<EOS>
"
let
her
sleep

"
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
silence
of
some
few
minute
duration
.
<EOS>
Flora
have
drop
into
a
deep
slumber
.
<EOS>
that
silence
be
first
break
by
George
,
who
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Marchdale
,
look
at
that
portrait
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
point
to
the
portrait
in
the
frame
to
which
we
have
allude
,
and
the
moment
Marchdale
look
at
it
he
sink
into
a
chair
as
he
exclaimed,--
 
<EOS>
"
Gracious
Heaven
,
how
like

<EOS>
"
It

Henry

<EOS>
"
those
eyes--

the
contour

the
countenance

strange
shape
of
the
mouth

"
exact
--
exact

"
 
<EOS>
"
that
picture
shall
be
move
from
here
.
<EOS>
the
sight
of
it
be
at
once
sufficient
to
awaken
all
her
former
terror
in
poor
Flora
's
brain
if
she
should
chance
to
awaken
and
cast
her
eye
suddenly
upon
it

<EOS>
"
and
be
it
so
like
him
who
come
here

say
the
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
very
man
himself

Mr.
Marchdale
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not

any

<EOS>
"
It

the

something
to

hold
a
consultation

Henry
;

I
shall
keep
my

from

there
can

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
fetch
you
my
powder
-
flask
and
bullet
,
"
say
Mr.
Marchdale
;
"
and
you
can
,
if
you
please
,
reload
the
pistol
.
<EOS>
in
about
two
hour
more
it
will
be
broad
daylight
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
arrangement
be
adopt
.
<EOS>
Henry
do
reload
the
pistol
,
and
place
them
on
a
table
by
the
side
of
the
bed
,
ready
for
immediate
action
,
and
then
,
as
Flora
be
sleep
soundly
,
all
leave
the
room
but
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bannerworth
be
the
last
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
remain
,
but
for
the
earnest
solicitation
of
Henry
,
that
she
would
endeavour
to
get
some
sleep
to
make
up
for
her
break
night
's
repose
,
and
she
be
indeed
so
break
down
by
her
alarm
on
Flora
's
account
,
that
she
have
not
power
to
resist
,
but
with
tear
flow
from
her
eye
,
she
seek
her
own
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
the
calmness
of
the
night
resume
its
sway
in
that
evil
-
fate
mansion
;
and
although
no
one
really
sleep
but
<EOS>
Flora
,
all
be
still
.
<EOS>
busy
think
keep
every
one
else
wakeful
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
mockery
to
lie
down
at
all
,
and
Henry
,
full
of
strange
and
painful
feeling
as
he
be
,
prefer
his
present
position
to
the
anxiety
and
apprehension
on
Flora
's
account
which
he
know
he
should
feel
if
she
be
not
within
the
sphere
of
his
own
observation
,
and
she
sleep
as
soundly
as

infant
tired

CHAPTER
IV
.
 
<EOS>
the
morning.--the
consultation.--the
FEARFUL
suggestion
.
  
<EOS>
[
illustration
]
 
what
wonderfully
different
impression
and
feeling
,
with
regard
to
the
same
circumstance
,
come
across
the
mind
in
the
broad
,
clear
,
and
beautiful
light
of
day
to
what
haunt
the
imagination
,
and
often
render
the
judgment
almost
incapable
of
action
,
when
the
heavy
shadow
of
night
be
upon
all
thing
.
 
<EOS>
there
must
be
a
downright
physical
reason
for
this
effect
--
it
be
so
remarkable
and
so
universal
.
<EOS>
It
seem
that
the
sun
's
ray
so
completely
alter
and
modify
the
constitution
of
the
atmosphere
,
that
it
produce
,
as
we
inhale
it
,
a
wonderfully
different
effect
upon
the
nerve
of
the
human
subject
.
 
<EOS>
We
can
account
for
this
phenomenon
in
no
other
way
.
<EOS>
perhaps
never
in
his
life
have
he
,
Henry
Bannerworth
,
feel
so
strongly
this
transition
of
feeling
as
he
now
feel
it
,
when
the
beautiful
daylight
gradually
dawn
upon
him
,
as
he
keep
his
lonely
watch
by
the
bedside
of
his
slumbering
sister
.
 
<EOS>
that
watch
have
be
a
perfectly
undisturbed
one
.
<EOS>
not
the
least
sight
or
sound
of
any
intrusion
have
reach
his
sense
.
<EOS>
all
have
be
as
still
as
the
very
grave
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
while
the
night
last
,
and
he
be
more
indebted
to
the
ray
of
the
candle
,
which
he
have
place
upon
a
shelf
,
for
the
power
to
distinguish
object
than
to
the
light
of
the
morning
,
<EOS>
a
thousand
uneasy
and
strange
sensation
have
find
a
home
in
his
agitate
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
so
many
time
at
the
portrait
which
be
in
the
panel
that
at
length
he
feel
an
undefined
sensation
of
terror
creep
over
him
whenever
he
take
his
eye
off
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
try
to
keep
himself
from
look
at
it
,
but
he
find
it
vain
,
so
he
adopt
what
,
perhaps
,
be
certainly
the
wise
,
good
plan
,
namely
,
to
look
at
it
continually
.
 
<EOS>
He
shift
his
chair
so
that
he
could
gaze
upon
it
without
any
effort
,
and
he
place
the
candle
so
that
a
faint
light
be
throw
upon
it
,
and
there
he
sit
,
a
prey
to
many
conflicting
and
uncomfortable
feeling
,
until
the
daylight
begin
to
make
the
candle
flame
look
dull
and
sickly
.
 
<EOS>
solution
for
the
event
of
the
night
he
could
find
none
.
<EOS>
He
rack
his
imagination
in
vain
to
find
some
mean
,
however
vague
,
of
endeavour
to
account
for
what
occur
,
and
still
he
be
at
fault
.
<EOS>
all
be
to
him
wrap
in
the
gloom
of
the
most
profound
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
and
how
strangely
,
too
,
the
eye
of
that
portrait
appear
to
look
upon
him
--
as
if
instinct
with
life
,
and
as
if
the
head
to
which
they
belong
be
busy
in
endeavour
to
find
out
the
secret
communing
of
his
soul
.
<EOS>
It
be
wonderfully
well
execute
that
portrait
;
so
life
-
like
,
that
the
very
feature
seem
to
move
as
you
gaze
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
remove
,
"
say
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
remove
it
now
,
but
that
it
seem
absolutely
paint
on
the
panel
,
and
I
should
awake
Flora
in
any
attempt
to
do
so
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
arise
and
ascertain
that
such
be
the
case
,
and
that
it
would
require
a
workman
,
with
proper
tool
adapt
to
the
job
,
to
remove
the
portrait
.
 
<EOS>
"
true
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
may
now
destroy
it
,
but
it
be
a
pity
to
obscure
a
work
of
such
rare
art
as
this
be
;
I
should
blame
myself
if
I
be
.
<EOS>
It
shall
be
remove
to
some
other
room
of
the
house
,
however
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
it
strike
Henry
how
foolish
it
would
be
to
remove
the
portrait
from
the
wall
of
a
room
which
,
in
all
likelihood
,
after
that
night
,
would
be
uninhabite
;
for
it
be
not
probable
that
Flora
would
choose
again
to
inhabit
a
chamber
in
which
she
have
go
through
so
much
terror
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
can
be
leave
where
it
be
,
"
he
say
,
"
and
we
can
fasten
up
,
if
we
please
,
even
the
very
door
of
this
room
,
so
that
no
one
need
trouble
themselves
any
further
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
morning
be
now
come
fast
,
and
just
as
Henry
think
he
would
partially
draw
a
blind
across
the
window
,
<EOS>
in
order
to
shield
from
the
direct
ray
of
the
sun
the
eye
of
Flora
,
she
awake
.
 
<EOS>
"
help
--
help
!
"
<EOS>
she
cry
,
and
Henry
be
by
her
side
in
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
safe
,
Flora
--
you
be
safe
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
where
be
it
now
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
--
what
,
dear
Flora
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
dreadful
apparition
.
<EOS>
oh
,
what
have
I
do
to
be
make
thus
perpetually
miserable
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
think
no
more
of
it
,
Flora
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
think
.
<EOS>
My
brain
be
on
fire
!
<EOS>
a
million
of
strange
eye
seem
gaze
on
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Great
Heaven
!
<EOS>
she
rave
,
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
hark
--
hark
--
hark
!
<EOS>
He
come
on
the
wing
of
the
storm
.
<EOS>
oh
,
it
be
most
horrible
--
horrible
!
"
 
<EOS>
Henry
ring
the
bell
,
but
not
sufficiently
loudly
to
create
any
alarm
.
<EOS>
the
sound
reach
the
wake
ear
of
the
mother
,
who
in
a
few
moment
be
in
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
have
awaken
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
and
have
speak
,
but
she
seem
to
me
to
wander
in
her
discourse
.
<EOS>
for
God
's
sake
,
soothe
her
,
and
try
to
bring
her
mind
round
to
its
usual
state
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
Henry
--
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
I
think
,
mother
,
if
you
be
to
get
her
out
of
this
room
,
and
into
some
other
chamber
as
far
remove
from
this
one
as
possible
,
it
would
tend
to
withdraw
her
mind
from
what
have
occur
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
it
shall
be
do
.
<EOS>
oh
,
Henry
,
what
be
it
<EOS>
--
what
do
you
think
it
be
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
lose
in
a
sea
of
wild
conjecture
.
<EOS>
I
can
form
no
conclusion
;
where
be
Mr.
Marchdale
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
in
his
chamber
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
go
and
consult
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
Henry
proceed
at
once
to
the
chamber
,
which
be
,
as
he
know
,
occupy
by
Mr.
Marchdale
;
and
as
he
cross
the
corridor
,
he
could
not
but
pause
a
moment
to
glance
from
a
window
at
the
face
of
nature
.
 
<EOS>
as
be
often
the
case
,
the
terrific
storm
of
the
precede
evening
have
clear
the
air
,
and
render
it
deliciously
invigorate
and
life
-
like
.
<EOS>
the
weather
have
be
dull
,
and
there
have
be
for
some
day
a
certain
heaviness
in
the
atmosphere
,
which
be
now
entirely
remove
.
 
<EOS>
the
morning
sun
be
shine
with
uncommon
brilliancy
,
bird
be
singe
in
every
tree
and
on
every
bush
;
so
pleasant
,
so
spirit
-
stir
,
health
-
give
a
morning
,
<EOS>
seldom
have
he
see
.
<EOS>
and
the
effect
upon
his
spirit
be
great
,
although
not
altogether
what
it
may
have
be
,
have
all

the
ordinary
little
casualty

evil
fortune
have
certainly
from

to
time
,
in
the
shape
of
illness

and
one
thing

another

attack
the
family
of
the
Bannerworths

common

here
suddenly

arise
a
something
at

terrible

inexplicable

He
find
Mr.

up
and
dress

apparently
in
deep
and
anxious
thought

<EOS>
the
moment
he
see
Henry
,
he
said,--

"
Flora
be
awake
,
I
presume
.

"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
but
her
mind
appear
to
be
much
disturb

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
from
bodily
weakness
,
I
dare
say
.

"
 
<EOS>
"
but
why
should
she
be
bodily
weak
?
<EOS>
she
be
strong
and
<EOS>
well
,
ay
,
<EOS>
as
well
as
she
could
ever
be
in
all
her
life

<EOS>
the
glow
of
youth

health
be
on
her
cheek

<EOS>
be
it
possible
that
,
in
the
course

one
night

she
should
become
bodily
weak
to
such
an
extent

close

"
 
<EOS>
the
day
wear
on
,
and
Poor
Flora
remain
in
a
very
precarious
situation
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
mid
-
day
that
Henry
make
up
his
mind
he
would
call
in
a
medical
gentleman
to
her
,
and
then
he
ride
to
the
neighbour
market
-
town
,
where
he
know
an
extremely
intelligent
practitioner
reside
.
<EOS>
this
gentleman
Henry
resolve
upon
,
under
a
promise
of
secrecy
,
making
confidant
of
;
but
,
long
before
he
reach
him
,
he
find
he
may
well
dispense
with
the
promise
of
secrecy
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
never
think
,
so
engaged
have
he
be
with
other
matter
,
that
the
servant
be
cognizant
of
the
whole
affair
,
and
that
from
them
he
have
no
expectation
of
be
able
to
keep
the
whole
story
in
all
its
detail
.
<EOS>
of
course
such
an
opportunity
for
tale
-
bearing
and
gossip
be
not
likely
to
be
lose
;
and
while
Henry
be
think
over
how
he
have
well
act
in
the
matter
,
the
news
that
Flora
Bannerworth
have
be
visit
in
the
night
by
a
vampyre
--
for
the
servant
name
the
visitation
such
at
once
--
be
spread
all
over
the
county
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
ride
along
,
Henry
meet
a
gentleman
on
horseback
who
belong
to
the
county
,
and
who
,
rein
in
his
steed
,
say
to
him
,
 
"
good
morning
,
Mr.
Bannerworth
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
good
morning
,
"
respond
Henry
,
and
he
would
have
ride
on
,
but
the
gentleman
added,--
 
"
excuse
me
for
interrupt
you
,
sir
;
but
what
be
the
strange
story
that
be
in
everybody
's
mouth
about
a
vampyre
?
"
 
<EOS>
Henry
nearly
fall
off
his
horse
,
he
be
so
much
astonished
,
and
,
wheel
the
animal
around
,
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
in
everybody
's
mouth
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
have
hear
it
from
at

a
dozen
person
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
surprise
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
untrue
?
<EOS>
of
course
I
be
not
so
absurd
as
really
to
believe
about
the
vampyre
;
but
be
there
no
foundation
at
all
for
it
?
<EOS>
We
generally
find
that
at
the
bottom
of
these
common
report
there
be
a
something
around
which
,
as
a
nucleus
,
the
whole
have
form
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
sister
be
unwell

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

ah
,

that
be
all

<EOS>
It
really
be

bad

now

<EOS>
"
We
have
a
visitor
last
night

a

I
suppose

"
 
<EOS>
"
yes

yes

I

<EOS>
I
do
believe
it
be
a
thief
,
and
she
be
terrified
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
and
upon
such
a
thing
be
graft
a
story
of
a
vampyre
,
and
the
mark
of
his
tooth
be
in
her
neck
,
and
all
the
circumstantial
particular
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes

"
 
<EOS>
"
good
morning
,
Mr.
Bannerworth
.
"
 
<EOS>
Henry
bid
the
gentleman
good
morning
,
and
much
vexed
at
the
publicity
which
the
affair
have
already
obtain
<EOS>
,
he
set
spur
to
his
horse
,
determine
that
he
would
speak
to
no
one
else
upon
so
uncomfortable
a
theme
.
<EOS>
several
attempt
be
make
to
stop
him
,
but
he
only
wave
his
hand
and
trot
on
,
nor
do
he
pause
in
his
speed
till
he
reach
the
door
of
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
the
medical
man
whom
he
intend
to
consult
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
know
that
at
such
a
time
he
would
be
at
home
,
which
be
the
case
,
and
he
be
soon
closet
with
the
man
of
drug
.
<EOS>
Henry
beg
his
patient
hearing
,
which
be
accord
,
he
relate
to
him
at
full
length
what
have
happen
,
not
omit
,
to
the
good
of
his
remembrance
,
any
one
particular
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
conclude
his
narration
,
the
doctor
shift
his
position
several
time
,
and
then
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
all
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
--
and
enough
too
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
More
than
enough
,
I
should
say
,
my
young
friend
.
<EOS>
You
astonish
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Can
you
form
any
supposition
,
sir
,
on
the
subject
?
"
 
"
not
just
now
.
<EOS>
what
be
your
own
idea
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
be
say
to
have
one
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
absurd
to
tell
you
that
my
brother
George
be
impress
with
a
belief
a
vampyre
have
visit
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
in
all
my
life
hear
a
more
circumstantial
narrative
in
favour
of
so
hideous
a
superstition
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
you
can
not
believe--
"
 
<EOS>
"
believe
what
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
the
dead
can
come
to
life
again
,
and
by
such
a
process
keep
up
vitality
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
take
me
for
a
fool
?
<EOS>
"
 
"
certainly
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
why
do
you
ask
me
such
question
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
the
glaring
fact
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
if
they
be
ten
time
more
glaring
<EOS>
,
I
will
not
believe
it
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
believe
you
be
all
mad
,
the
whole
family
of
you
--
that
at
the
full
of
the
moon
you
all
be
a
little
cracked
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
so
would
i.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
go
home
now
,
and
I
will
call
and
see
your
sister
in
the
course
of
two
hour
.
<EOS>
something
may
turn
up
yet
,
to
throw
some
new
light
upon
this
strange
subject
.
"
 
<EOS>
with
this
understanding
Henry
go
home
,
and
he
take
care
to
ride
as
fast
as
before
,
in
order
to
avoid
question
,
so
that
he
get
back
to
his
old
ancestral
home
without
go
through
the
disagreeable
ordeal
of
have
to
explain
to
any
one
what
have
disturb
the
peace
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
when
Henry
reach
his
home
,
he
find
that
the
evening
be
rapidly
come
on
,
and
before
he
could
permit
himself
to
think
upon
any
other
subject
,
he
inquire
how
his
terrified
sister
have
pass
the
hour
during
his
absence
.
 
<EOS>
He
find
that
<EOS>
but
little
improvement
have
take
place
in
her
,
and
that
she
have
occasionally
sleep
,
but
to
awaken
and
speak
incoherently
,
as
if
the
shock
she
have
receive
have
have
some
serious
affect
upon
her
nerve
.
<EOS>
He
repair
at
once
to
her
room
,
and
,
find
that
she
be
awake
,
he
lean
over
her
,
and
speak
tenderly
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Flora
,
"
he
say
,
"
<EOS>

be
calm

<EOS>
no

some
attempt

rob
the
house

"
 
<EOS>
"
think
you
so
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
the
bay
window
be
peculiarly
adapt
for

a
purpose

do
you
not

at
night

indeed

Flora

you

She
clutch

Good
God

who
tell
you
so

no

groan
Henry

"

Discard

I
pray
you

such
a

Can

from

true

hark

what

I

when
you
go

for
some

be
there
not

the
accidental
shutting

be
it
that

It
be

then
I
be
relieved

<EOS>
Henry
,
I
sometimes
fancy
I
be
in
the
tomb
,
and
that
some
one
be
feast
on
my
flesh

<EOS>
They
do
say
,
too
,
that
those
who
in
life
have
be
bleed
by
a
vampyre
,
become
themselves
vampyre
,
and
have
the

horrible
taste
for
blood

those
before
them

it
not
horrible

he
ring

She
do
so

go
down

the
medical

whose
opinion
he
be
certainly
eager
to
be
now
make
acquainted
with

as
soon
as
they
be
alone
in
an
old

fashioned
room

be
call
the
oak
closet

Henry
turn
to
Mr.

said,--

"
what
,
now
,
be
your
candid
opinion
,
sir

You
have
see
my

those
strange
indubitable
evidence

something
wrong

<EOS>
"
I
have
;

to
tell
you
candidly
the
truth
,
Mr.

I
be
sorely
perplex
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
would
be

It
be
not
often
that
a

like
to
say
so
much
,
nor
be
it
,
indeed
,
often
prudent
that
he
should
do
so
,
but
in
this
case
I
own
I
be
much
puzzle
.
<EOS>
It
be
contrary
to
all
my
notion
upon
all
such
subject

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
those

what
do
you

know
not
what
to

I
be
completely
puzzle

but
,
but
do
they
not
really
bear
the
appearance
of
be
bite
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
really
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
so
far
,
then
,
they
be
actually
in
favour
of
the
dreadful
supposition
which
poor
Flora
entertain
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
far
they
certainly
be
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
in
the
world
of
their
be
bite
;
but
we
not
must
jump
to
a
conclusion
that
the
tooth
which
inflict
them
be
human
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
strange
case
,
and
one
which
I
feel
assured
must
give
you
all
much
uneasiness
,
as
,
indeed
,
it
give
me
;
but
,
as
I
say
before
,
I
will
not
let
my
judgment
give
in
to
the
fearful
and
degrade
superstition
which
all
the
circumstance
connect
with
this
strange
story
would
seem
to
justify
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
degrading
superstition
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
to
my
mind
your
sister
seem
to
be
labour
under
the
effect
of
some
narcotic
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
unless
she
really
have
lose
a
quantity
of
blood
,
which
loss
have
decrease
the
heart
's
action
sufficiently
to
produce
the
languor
under
which
she
now
evidently
labour
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
that
I
could
believe
the
former
supposition
,
but
I
be
confident
she
have
take
no
narcotic
;
she
could
not
even
do
so
by
mistake
,
for
there
be
no
drug
of
the
sort
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
besides
,
she
be
not
heedless
by
any
mean
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
convinced
she
have
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
I
be
fairly
puzzle
,
my
young
friend
,
and
I
can
only
say
that
I
would
freely
have
give
half
of
what
I
be
worth
to
see
that
figure
you
see
last
night

<EOS>

what
would
you
have

wealth

would
have

freeze
with
horror

terrible

and
yet
let

it

if
I

Mr.

appear
to
be
for
a
few
moment
lose
in
thought

then
suddenly
rouse
himself

as
if
he
find
it
either
impossible

any
rational
conclusion
upon
the
subject

have
arrive
at
one

choose

we
must
leave

at

about
vampyre

<EOS>

I
certainly
have

very
common

the

all
that
I
have

make
it
a

can

restore
to

much

that
the
hideous
repast
of

have
to
be
take
very
frequently

that

get
it
not
he
waste
away

present
the

there
be
a
note
at

part

Henry
read
as
follows:--

with

to
these
vampyre
,
it
be
believe
by
those
who
be
inclined
to
give
credence
to

so
dreadful
a
superstition
,
that
they
always
endeavour
to
make
their
feast
of
blood
,
for
the
revival
of
their
bodily
power
,
on
some
evening
immediately
precede
a
full
moon

because
if
any
accident
befal
them
,
such
as
be
shoot
,
or
otherwise
kill

wound

they
can
recover
by
lie
down

we

I
must
,
of
course

return
a

it
must
be

you

the

<EOS>
this
be
an
argument
which
Henry
feel
himself
the
force
of
too
strongly
not

admit
it
in

case
of
George

he
therefore
make
no

his

make
one

there

they

rather
in

urge

not

destroy
his

he
said,--

He
produce

on

fashioned
piece

two
button

<EOS>
upon

this
appear
to

suddenly
,
Henry

with

now

add
Mr.

Mr.

replace
the

It
be
within
a
very
few
minute
of
midnight
<EOS>
,
the
moon
have
climb
high
in
the
heavens

a
night
of
such
brightness

beauty
have
seldom
show
itself
for
a
long
period
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
sleep
,
and
in
her
chamber
sit
the
two
brother
and
Mr.
Marchdale
,
silently
,
for
she
have
show
symptom
of
restlessness
,
and
they
much
fear
to
break
the
light
slumber
into
which
she
have
fall
.
 
<EOS>
occasionally
they
have
converse
in
whisper
,
which
could
not
have
the
effect
of
rouse
her
,
for
the
room
,
although
small
than
the
one
she
have
before
occupy
,
be
still
sufficiently
spacious
to
enable
them
to
get
some
distance
from
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
until
the
hour
of
midnight
now
actually
strike
,
they
be
silent
,
and
when
the
last
echo
of
the
sound
have
die
away
,
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
come
over
them
,
which
prompt
some
conversation
to
get
rid
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
bright
the
moon
be
now
,
"
say
Henry
,
in
a
low
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never

it
bright

reply
Marchdale
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
as
if
I

we
shall
not

night

"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
late
than
this
,
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
--
it
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
then
yet
congratulate
us
upon
no
visit

"
 
<EOS>
"
how
still
the
house
be
!
"
remark
George
;
"
it
seem
to
me
as
if
I
have
never
find
it
so
intensely
quiet
before
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
still
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
<EOS>
she
move
.
"
 
<EOS>
Flora
moan
in
her
sleep
,
and
make
a
slight
movement
.
<EOS>
the
curtain
be
all
draw
closely
round
the
bed
to
shield
her
eye
from
the
bright
moonlight
which
stream
into
the
room
so
brilliantly
.
<EOS>
They
may
have
close
the
shutter
of
the
window
,
but
this
they
do
not
like
to
do
,
as
it
would
render
their
watch
there
of
no
avail
at
all
,
inasmuch
as
they
would
not
be
able
to
see
if
any
attempt
be
make
by
any
one
to
obtain
admittance
.
 
<EOS>
a
quarter
of
an
hour
longer
may
have
thus
pass
when
Mr.
Marchdale
say
in
a
whisper,--
 
"
a
thought
have
just
strike
me
that
the
piece
of
coat
I
have
,
which
I
drag
from
the
figure
last
night
,
wonderfully
resemble
in
colour
and
appearance
the
style
of
dress
of
the
portrait
in
the
room
which
Flora
lately
sleep
in
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
of
that
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
<EOS>
when
first
I
see
it
;
but
,
to
tell
the
honest
truth
,
I
dread
to
suggest
any
new
proof
connect
with
last
night
's
visitation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
I
ought
not
to
have
draw
your
attention
to
it
,
"
say
Mr.
Marchdale
,
"
and
regret
I
have
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Nay
,
do
not
blame
yourself
on
such
an
account
,
"
say
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
quite
right
,
and
it
be
I
who
be
too
foolishly
sensitive
.
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
since
you
have
mention
it
,
I
must
own
I
have
a
great
desire
to
test
the
accuracy
of
the
observation
by
a
comparison
with
the
portrait
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
may
easily
be
do
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
remain
here
,
"
say
George
,
"
in
case
Flora
awaken
,
while
you
two
go
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
It
be
but
across
the
corridor
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Henry
immediately
rise
,
saying--
 
<EOS>
"
come
,
Mr.
Marchdale
,
come
.
<EOS>
let
us
satisfy
ourselves
at
all
event
upon
this
point
at
once
.
<EOS>
as
George
say
it
be
only
across
the
corridor
,
and
we
can
return
directly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
willing
,
"
say
Mr.
Marchdale
,
with
a
tone
of
sadness
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
light
need
,
for
the
moon
stand
suspend
in
a
cloudless
sky
,
so
that
from
the
house
be
a
detach
one
,
and
contain
numerous
window
,
it
be
as
light
as
day
.
 
<EOS>
although
the
distance
from
one
chamber
to
the
other
be
only
across
the
corridor
,
it
be
a
great
space
than
these
word
may
occupy
,
for
the
corridor
be
wide
,
neither
be
it
directly
across
,
but
considerably
slant
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
certainly
sufficiently
close
at
hand
for
any
sound
of
alarm
from
one
chamber
to
reach
another
without
any
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
moment
suffice
to
place
Henry
and
Mr.
Marchdale
in
that
antique
room
,
where
,
from
the
effect
of
the
moonlight
which
be
stream
over
it
,
the
portrait
on
the
panel
look
exceedingly
life
like
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
effect
be
probably
the
great
because
the
rest
of
the
room
be
not
illuminate
by
the
moon
's
ray
,
which
come
through
a
window
in
the
corridor
,
and
then
at
the
open
door
of
that
chamber
upon
the
portrait
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Marchdale
hold
the
piece
of
cloth
he
have
close
to
the
dress
of
the
portrait
,
and
one
glance
be
sufficient
to
show
the
wonderful
likeness
between
the
two
.
 
<EOS>
"
good
God
!
"
say
Henry
,
"
it
be
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Marchdale
drop
the
piece
of
cloth
and
tremble
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
fact
shake
even
your
scepticism
,
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
what
to
make
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
tell
you
something
which
bear
upon
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
if
you
be
sufficiently
aware
of
my
family
history
to
know
that
this
one
of
my
ancestor

I
wish
I
could

worthy
ancestor

committed
suicide

<EOS>
"
You
--
you
be
sure
of
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
more
and
more
bewildered
as
each
moment
some
strange
corroborative
fact
of
that
dreadful
supposition
we
so
much
shrink
from
seem
to
come
to
light
and
to
force
itself
upon
our
attention
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
silence
of
a
few
moment
duration
,
and
Henry
have
turn
towards
Mr.
Marchdale
to
say
something
,
when
the
cautious
tread
of
a
footstep
be
hear
in
the
garden
,
immediately
beneath
that
balcony
.
 
<EOS>
a
sickening
sensation
come
over
Henry
,
and
he
be
compel
to
lean
against
the
wall
for
support
,
as
in
scarcely
articulate
accent
<EOS>
he
said--
 
<EOS>
"
the
vampyre
--
the
vampyre
!
<EOS>
God
of

,
it
have
come
once
again

<EOS>
"
now
,
Heaven
inspire
us
with
more
than
mortal
courage

"
cry
Mr.
Marchdale
,
and
he
dash
open
the
window
at
once
,
and
spring
into
the
balcony
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
in
a
moment
recover
himself
sufficiently
to
follow
him
,
and
when
he
reach
his
side
in
the
balcony
,
Marchdale
say
,
as
he
point
below,--
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
some
one
conceal
there
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
where
--
where
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
among
the
laurel
.
<EOS>
I
will
fire
a
random
shot
,
and
we
may
do
some
execution
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
hold
!
<EOS>
"
say
a
voice
from
below
;
"
do
not
do
any
such
thing
,
I
beg
of
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
that
be
Mr.
Chillingworth
's
voice
,
"
cry
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
and
it
be
Mr.
Chillingworth
's
person
,
too
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
as
he
emerge
from
among
some
laurel
bush
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
be
this
?
"
say
Marchdale

<EOS>
"
simply
that
I
make
up
my

keep
watch

ward
to

why
do

take
a
hasty
examination
of
the
garden

ground
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
willing
;
but
first
allow
me
to
speak
to
George
,
who
otherwise
may
be
surprised
at
our
long
absence
.
"
 
<EOS>
Henry
walk
rapidly
to
the
bed
chamber
of
Flora
,
and
he
say
to
george,--
 
"
have
you
any
objection
to
be
leave
alone
here
for
about
half
an
hour
,
George
,
while
we
make
an
examination
of
the
garden

"
 
<EOS>
"
let
me
have
some
weapon
<EOS>

I
care
not

remain
here
while

fetch
a
sword
from
my
own
room

Henry
do
so
,
and
when
George
return
with
a
sword
,
which
he
always
keep
in
his
bed
-
room
,
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
now
go
,
Henry
.
<EOS>
I
prefer
a
weapon
of
this
description
to
pistols
much
.
<EOS>
do
not

longer
go
than
necessary

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
George
be
then
leave
alone
,
and
Henry
return
to
the
balcony
,
where
Mr.
Marchdale
be
wait
for
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
quick
mode
of
descend
to
the
garden
to
do
so
by
clamber
over
the
balcony
than
any
other
,
and
the
height
be
not
considerable
enough
to
make
it
very
objectionable
,
so
Henry
and
Mr.
Marchdale
choose
that
way
of
join
Mr.
Chillingworth
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
,
no
doubt
,
much
surprised
at
find
me
here
,
"
say
the
doctor
;
"
but
the
fact
be
,
I
half
make
up
my
mind
to
come
while
I
be
here
;
but
I
have
not
thoroughly
do
so
,
therefore
I
say
nothing
to
you
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
be
much
indebted
to
you
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
for
make
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
prompt
to
it
by
a
feeling
of
the
strong
curiosity
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
you
armed
,
sir
?
"
say
Marchdale
.
 
<EOS>
"
in
this
stick

"
say
the
doctor
,
"
be
a
sword
,
the
exquisite
temper
of
which
I
know
I
can
depend
upon
,
and
I
fully
intend
to
run
through
any
one
whom
I
see
that
look
in
the
least
of
the
vampyre
order
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
have
do
quite
right
,
"
reply
Mr.
Marchdale
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
brace
of
pistol
here
,
load
with
ball
;
will
you
take
one
,
Henry

if
you
please

then
we
shall
be
all
armed

<EOS>
thus
,
then
,
prepare
for
any
exigency
,
they
make
the
whole
round
of
the
house
;
but
find
all
the
fastening
secure
,
and
everything
as
quiet
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
"
suppose
,
now
,
we
take
a
survey
of
the
park
outside
the
garden
wall
,
"
say
Mr.
Marchdale
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
agree
to
;
but
before
they
have
proceed
far
,
Mr.
Marchdale
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
ladder
lie
on
the
wall
;
would
it
not
be
a
good
plan
to
place
it
against
the
very
spot
the
suppose
vampyre
jump
over
last
night
,
and
<EOS>
so
,
from
a
more
elevated
position
,
take
a
view
of
the
open
meadow
.
<EOS>
We
could
easily
drop
down
on
the
outer
side
,
if
we
see
anything
suspicious
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
a
bad
plan
,
"
say
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
we
do
it
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
"
say
Henry
;
and
they
accordingly
carry
the
ladder
,
which
have
be
use
for
prune
the
tree
,
towards
the
spot
at
the
end
of
the
long
walk
,
at
which
the
vampyre
have
make
good
,
after
so
many
fruitless
effort
,
his
escape
from
the
premise
.
 
<EOS>
They
make
haste
down
the
long
vista
of
tree
until
they
reach
the
exact
spot
,
and
then
they
place
the
ladder
as
near
as
possible
,
exactly
where
Henry
,
in
his
bewilderment
on
the
evening
before
,
have
see
the
apparition
from
the
grave
spring
to
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
can
ascend
singly
,
"
say
Marchdale
;
"
but
there
be
ample
space
for
us
all
there
to
sit
on
the
top
of
the
wall
and
make
our
observation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
see
to
be
the
case
,
and
in
about
a
couple
of
minute
they
have
take
up
their
position
on
the
wall
,
and
,
although
the
height
be
but
trifle
,
they
find
that
they
have
a
much
more
extensive
view
than
they
could
have
obtain
by
any
other
mean
.
 
<EOS>
"
to
contemplate
the
beauty
of
such
a
night
as
this
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
"
be
amply
sufficient
compensation
for
come
the
distance
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
who
know
,
"
remark
Marchdale
,
"
we
may
yet
see
something
which
may
throw
a
light
upon
our
present
perplexity
<EOS>
God
know
that
I
would
give
all
I
can
call
mine
in
the
world
to
relieve
you
and
your
sister
,
Henry
Bannerworth
,
from
the
fearful
effect
which
last
night
's
proceeding
can
not
fail
to
have
upon
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
of
that
I
be
well
assure
,
Mr.
Marchdale

"
say
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
if
the
happiness
of
myself

depend
upon
you

we
should
be
happy
indeed

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
silent

Mr.
Chillingworth

remark
Marchdale
,
after
a
slight
pause
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth--"hush
--
hush

"
 
<EOS>
"
Good
God
,
what
do
you
hear
?
"
cry
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
the
doctor
lay
his
hand
upon
Henry
's
arm
as
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
young
lime
tree
yonder
to
the
right
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
--
yes
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
carry
your
eye
from
it
in
a
horizontal
line
,
as
near
as
you
can
,
towards
the
wood
.
"
 
<EOS>
Henry
do
so
,
and
then
he
utter
a
sudden
exclamation
of
surprise
,
and
point
to
a
rise
spot
of
ground
,
which
be
yet
,
in
consequence
of
the
number
of
tall
tree
in
its
vicinity
,
partially
envelop
in
shadow
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
something
,
"

Marchdale
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
by
Heaven
!
<EOS>
it
be
a
human
form
lie

there

<EOS>
"
It
be
--
as
if
in
death

"
 
<EOS>
"
what
can
it
be
?
"
say
Chillingworth
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
dread
to
say
,
"
reply
marchdale
;
"
but
to
my
eye
,
even
at
this
distance
,
it
seem
like
the
form
of
him
we
chase
last
night
.

<EOS>
"
the
vampyre

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

yes

him

"
 
<EOS>
Henry
's
eye
be
rivet
to
that
fearful
object
,
and
now
a
scene
present
itself
which
fill
them
all
with
wonder
and
astonishment
,
mingle
with
sensation
of
the
great
awe
and
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
moonbeam
,
in
consequence
of
the
luminary
rise
high
and
high
in

come
to

this
figure

<EOS>
"
the
vampyre

the
vampyre
!
"
say
Mr.
Marchdale
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
doubt
it
now
.
<EOS>
We
must
have
hit
him
last
night
with
the
pistol
bullet
,

the
moonbeam
be
now
restore
him
to
a
new
life

"
 
<EOS>
Henry
shudder
,
and
even
Mr.
Chillingworth
turn
pale
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
the
first
to
recover
himself
sufficiently
to
propose
some
course
of
action
,
and
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
let
us
descend
and
go
up
to
this
figure

<EOS>
It
be
a
duty
we
owe
to
ourselves
as
much
as

"
 
<EOS>
"
hold
a
moment
,
"
say
Mr.

,
as
he
produce
a
pistol
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
an
unerring
shot
,
as
you
well
know

Henry

<EOS>
before
we
move
from

position
we
now
occupy
,
allow
me
to
try
what
virtue
may
be
in
a
bullet
to
lay
that
figure
low
again

<EOS>
"
He
be

exclaim
Henry

<EOS>
Mr.
Marchdale
level
the
pistol
--
he
take
a
sure
and
deliberate
aim
,
and
then
,
just
as
the
figure
seem
to
be
struggle
to
its
foot

he
fire
,
and
,
with
a
sudden
bind

I

Hush

marchdale--"hush

do
it
not

you

<EOS>
"
oh

be
not
rash

cry
Marchdale

<EOS>
"
see

it
rise
again

its

gigantic

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
trust
in
Heaven

a

the
doctor

draw
the
sword

have
speak
of
from
the
stick

throw
away
the
scabbard

come
with

Henry
at
once
jump
down
from

follow
him

saying,--
 
<EOS>
"
come
on

I
will
not
shrink

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
run
towards
the
piece
of
rise
ground
;
but
before
they
get
to
it
,
the
form
rise
and
make
rapidly
towards
a
little
wood
which
be
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
hillock
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
conscious

the

"
<EOS>
see
how
it
glance
back

then
increase
its
speed

<EOS>
"
fire
upon
it

Henry

"
say
Marchdale
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
so
;
but
either
his
shot
do
not
take
effect
,
or
it
be
quite
unheeded
if
it
do
,
by
the
vampyre

which
gain
the
wood
before
they
could
have
a
hope
of
get
sufficiently
near
it
to
effect

endeavour
to
effect

a
capture

<EOS>
"
I
can
not

it
there

Marchdale

<EOS>
"
in
open
country
I

closely

Pursuit
be
useless

Poor
Henry

appear
to

so
suddenly
in

which
have
have
quite
enough

the

"
I
can
not

say
,
when

that
such

there

solemnly

in
Heaven

"
 
<EOS>

there
be
indeed

it

Mr.

you

"
 
<EOS>

to
a

in

these

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
no

indeed
;
if
you
be
to
shut
me
up

full
of

I
would
tell
them
all
to
their

what

we

You

true
;
I
see
a

lie
down

I
see
a
man

up

he
seem
then
to
be

whether

take
such

have
you
not

the
dreadful

<EOS>
"
no

no

on

no

I
will
die

Marchdale
;

there
be
one
circumstance

we
ought

it
be
that
,
from
all
we

there
seem
to
be
some
thing

would

anything

"
 
<EOS>
Henry
appear
to
rouse
for
some
moment
<EOS>
and
then
he
said,--

"
He
,
in

with
many
other

no

it

to
get
into

It
would
,

Henry

the
entrance

musingly

I
will

<EOS>
about
such
a

They
now
make
their
way
to
the
chamber
of

they
hear
from
George
that
nothing

CHAPTER
VI
.
 
<EOS>
a
GLANCE
<EOS>
at
<EOS>
the
bannerworth
family.--the
PROBABLE
consequence
of
the
MYSTERIOUS
apparition
's
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
[

]
 
have
thus
far
,
we
hope
,
interested
our
reader
in
the
fortune
of
a
family
which
have
become
subject
to
so
dreadful
a
visitation
<EOS>
,
we
trust
that
a
few
word
concern
them
,
and
the
peculiar
circumstance
in
which
they
be
now
place
,
will
not
prove
altogether
out
of
place
,
or
unacceptable
.
<EOS>
the
Bannerworth
family
then
be
well
know
in
the
part
of
the
country
where
they
reside
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
if
we
be
to
say
they
be
better
know
by
name
than
they
be
like
,
on
account
of
that
name
,
we
should
be
near
the
truth
,
for
it
have
unfortunately
happen
that
for
a
very
considerable
time
past
the
head
of
the
family
have
be
the
very
bad
speciman
of
it
that
could
be
procure
.
<EOS>
while
the
junior
branch
be
frequently
amiable
and
most
intelligent
,
and
such
in
mind
and
manner
as
be
calculate
to
inspire
goodwill
in
all
who
know
them
,
he
who
hold
the
family
property
,
and
who
reside
in
the
house
now
occupy
by
Flora
and
her
brother
,
be
a
very
so
--
so
sort
of
character
.
 
<EOS>
this
state
of
thing
,
by
some
strange
fatality
,
have
go
on
for
nearly
a
hundred
year
,
and
the
consequence
be
what
may
have
be
fairly
expect
,
namely
--
that
,
what
with
their
vice
and
what
with
their
extravagance
,
the
successive
head
of
the
Bannerworth
family
have
succeed
in
so
far
diminish
the
family
property
that
,
when
it
come
into
the
hand
of
Henry
Bannerworth
,
it
be
of
little
value
,
on
account
of
the
numerous
encumbrance
with
which
it
be
saddle
.
 
<EOS>
the
father
of
Henry
have
not
be
a
very
brilliant
exception
to
the
general
rule
,
as
regard
the
head
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
not
quite
so
bad
as
many
of
his
ancestor
,
that
gratify
circumstance
be
to
be
account
for
by
the
supposition
that
he
be
not
quite
so
bold
,
and
that
the
change
in
habit
,
manner
,
and
law
,
which
have
take
place
in
a
hundred
year
,
make
it
not
so
easy
for
even
a
landed
proprietor
to
play
the
petty
tyrant
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
,
to
get
rid
of
those
animal
spirit
which
have
prompt
many
of
his
predecessor
to
downright
crime
,
have
recourse
to
the
gaming
-
table
,
and
,
after
raise
whatever
sum
he
could
upon
the
property
which
remain
,
he
naturally
,
and
as
may
have
be
fully
expect
,
lose
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
find
lie
dead
in
the
garden
of
the
house
one
day
,
and
by
his
side
be
his
pocket
-
book
,
on
one
leaf
of
which
,
it
be
the
impression
of
the
family
,
he
have
endeavour
to
write
something
previous
to
his
decease
,
for
he
hold
a
pencil
firmly
in
his
grasp
.
 
<EOS>
the
probability
be
that
he
have
feel
himself
get
ill
,
and
,
be
desirous
of
make
some
communication
to
his
family
which
press
heavily
upon
his
mind
,
he
have
attempt
to
do
so
,
but
be
stop
by
the
too
rapid
approach
of
the
hand
of
death
.
 
<EOS>
for
some
day
previous
to
his
decease
,
his
conduct
have
be
extremely
mysterious
.
<EOS>
He
have
announce
an
intention
of
leave
England
for
ever
--
of
sell
the
house
and
ground
for
whatever
they
would
fetch
over
and
above
the
sum
for
which
they
be
mortgage
,
and
so
clear
himself
of
all
encumbrance
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
,
<EOS>
but
a
few
hour
before
he
be
find
lie
dead
,
make
the
following
singular
speech
to
<EOS>
henry,--
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
regret
,
Henry
,
that
the
old
house
which
have
be
in
our
family
so
long
be
about
to
be
part
with
.
<EOS>
be
assure
that
,
if
it
be
but
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
,
I
have
good
and
substantial
reason
now
for
what
I
be
about
to
do
.
<EOS>
We
shall
be
able
to
go
some
other
country
,
and
there
live
like
prince
of
the
land
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
where
the
mean
be
to
come
from
to
live
like
a
prince
,
unless
Mr.
Bannerworth
have
some
of
the
german
prince
in
his
eye
,
no
one
know
but
himself
,
and
his
sudden
death
bury
with
him
that
most
important
secret
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
some
word
write
on
the
leaf
of
his
pocket
-
book
,
but
they
be
of
by
far
too
indistinct
and
ambiguous
a
nature
to
lead
to
anything
.
<EOS>
They
be
these:--
 
<EOS>
"
the
money
be
----------
"
 
<EOS>
and
then
there
be
a
long
scrawl
of
the
pencil
,
which
seem
to
have
be
occasion
by
his
sudden
decease
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
nothing
could
be
make
of
these
word
,
except
in
the
way
of
a
contradiction
as
the
family
lawyer
say
,
rather
more
facetiously
than
a
man
of
law
usually
speak
,
for
if
he
have
write
"
the
money
be
not
,
"
he
would
have
be
somewhere
remarkably
near
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
with
all
his
vice
he
be
regret
by
his
child
,
who
choose
rather
to
remember
him
in
his
good
aspect
than
to
dwell
upon
his
fault
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
then
,
within
the
memory
of
man
,
the
head
of
the
family
of
the
Bannerworths
be
a
gentleman
,
in
every
sense
of
the
word
.
<EOS>
brave
,
generous
,
highly
educate
,
and
full
of
many
excellent
and
noble
quality
--
for
such
be
Henry
,
whom
we
have
introduce
to
our
reader
under
such
distress
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
,
people
say
,
that
the
family
property
have
be
all
dissipate
and
lose
,
there
would
take
place
a
change
,
and
that
the
bannerworth
would
have
to
take
to
some
course
of
honourable
industry
for
a
livelihood
,
and
that
then
they
would
be
as
much
respect
as
they
have
before
be
detest
and
dislike
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
position
which
Henry
hold
be
now
a
most
precarious
one
--
for
one
of
the
amazingly
clever
act
of
his
father
have
be
to
encumber
the
property
with
overwhelming
claim
,
so
that
when
Henry
administer
to
the
estate
,
it
be
doubt
almost
by
his
attorney
if
it
be
at
all
desirable
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
an
attachment
,
however
,
to
the
old
house
of
his
family
,
have
induce
the
young
man
to
hold
possession
of
it
as
long
as
he
could
,
despite
any
adverse
circumstance
which
may
eventually
be
connect
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
some
week
,
however
,
only
after
the
decease
of
his
father
,
and
when
he
fairly
hold
possession
,
a
sudden
and
a
most
unexpected
offer
come
to
him
from
a
solicitor
in
London
,
of
whom
he
know
nothing
,
to
purchase
the
house
and
ground
,
for
a
client
of
his
,
who
have
instruct
him
so
to
do
,
but
whom
he
do
not
mention
.
 
<EOS>
the
offer
make
be
a
liberal
one
,
and
beyond
the
value
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
the
lawyer
who
have
conduct
Henry
's
affair
for
him
since
his
father
's
decease
,
advise
him
by
all
mean
to
take
it
;
but
after
a
consultation
with
his
mother
and
sister
,
and
George
,
they
all
resolve
to
hold
by
their
own
house
as
long
as
they
could
,
and
,
consequently
,
he
refuse
the
offer
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
then
ask
to
let
the
place
,
and
to
name
his
own
price
for
the
occupation
of
it
;
but
that
he
would
not
do
:
so
the
negotiation
go
off
altogether
,
leave
only
,
in
the
mind
of
the
family
,
much
surprise
at
the
exceed
eagerness
of
some
one
,
whom
they
know
not
,
to
get
possession
of
the
place
on
any
term
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
another
circumstance
perhaps
which
materially
aid
in
produce
a
strong
feeling
on
the
mind
of
the
Bannerworths
,
with
regard
to
remain
where
they
be
.
 
<EOS>
that
circumstance
occur
thus
:
a
relation
of
the
family
,
who
be
now
dead
,
and
with
whom
have
die
all
his
mean
,
have
be
in
the
habit
,
for
the
last
half
dozen
year
of
his
life
,
of
send
a
hundred
pound
to
Henry
,
for
the
express
purpose
of
enable
him
and
his
brother
George
and
his
sifter
Flora
to
take
a
little
continental
or
home
tour
,
in
the
autumn
of
the
year
.
 
<EOS>
a
more
acceptable
present
,
or
for
a
more
delightful
purpose
,
to
young
people
,
could
not
be
find
;
and
,
with
the
quiet
,
prudent
habit
of
all
three
of
them
,
they
contrive
to
go
far
and
to
see
much
for
the
sum
which
be
thus
handsomely
place
at
their
disposal
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
of
those
excursion
,
when
among
the
mountain
of
Italy
,
an
adventure
occur
which
place
the
life
of
Flora
in
imminent
hazard
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
ride
along
a
narrow
mountain
path
,
and
,
her
horse
slip
,
she
fall
over
the
ledge
of
a
precipice

<EOS>
in
an
instant
,
a
young
man
,
a
stranger
to
the
whole
party
,
who
be

in
the
vicinity
,
rush
to
the
spot

and
by
his
knowledge
and
exertion

effect
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
her
to
lie
quiet
;
he
encourage
her
to
hope
for
immediate
succour
;
and
then
,
with
much
personal
exertion
,
and
at
immense
risk
to
himself
,
he
reach
the
ledge
of
rock
on
which
she
lie
,
and
then
he
support
her
until
the
brother
have
go
to
a
neighbouring
house
,
which
,
bye
-
the
-
bye
,
be
two
good
english
mile
off
,
and
get
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
there
come
on
,
while
they
be
go
,
a
terrific
storm
,
and
Flora
feel
that
but
for
him
who
be
with
her
she
must
have
be
hurl
from
the
rock
,
and
perish
in
an
abyss
below
,
which
be
almost
too
deep
for
observation
.
 
<EOS>
suffice
<EOS>
it
to
say
that
she
be
rescue
;
and
he
who
have
,
by
his
intrepidity
,
do
so
much
towards
save
her
,
be
load
with
the
most
sincere
and
heartfelt
acknowledgment
by
the
brother
as
well
as
by
herself
.
 
<EOS>
He
frankly
tell
them
that
his
name
be
Holland
;
that
he
be
travel
for
amusement
and
instruction
,
and
be
by
profession
an
artist
.
 
<EOS>
He
travel
with
them
for
some
time
;
and
it
be
not
at
all
to
be
wonder
at
,
under
the
circumstance
,
that
an
attachment
of
the
tender
nature
should
spring
up
between
him
and
the
beautiful
girl
,
who
feel
that
she
owe
to
him
her
life
.
 
<EOS>
mutual
glance
of
affection
be
exchange
between
them
,
and
it
be
arrange
that
when
he
return
to
England
,
he
should
come
at
once
as
an
honoured
guest
to
the
house
of
the
family
of
the
Bannerworths
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
be
settle
satisfactorily
with
the
full
knowledge
and
acquiescence
of
the
two
brother
,
who
have
take
a
strange
attachment
to
the
young
Charles
Holland
,
who
be
indeed
in
every
way
likely
to
propitiate
the
good
opinion
of
all
who
know
him
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
explain
to
him
exactly
how
they
be
situate
,
and
tell
him
that
when
he
come
he
would
find
a
welcome
from
all
,
except
possibly
his
father
,
whose
wayward
temper
he
could
not
answer
for
.
 
<EOS>
Young
Holland
state
that
he
be
compel
to
be
away
for
a
term
of
two
year
,
from
certain
family
arrangement
he
have
enter
into
,
and
that
then
he
would
return
and
hope
to
meet
Flora
unchanged
as
he
should
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
happen
that
this
be
the
last
of
the
continental
excursion
of
the
Bannerworths
,
for
,
before
another
year
roll
round
,
the
generous
relative
who
have
supply
them
with
the
mean
of
make
such
delightful
trip
be
no
more
;
and
,
likewise
,
the
death
of
the
father
have
occur
in
the
manner
we
have
relate
,
so
that
there
be
no
chance
as
have
be
anticipate
and
hope
for
by
Flora
,
of
meet
Charles
Holland
on
the
continent
again
,
before
his
two
year
of
absence
from
England
should
be
expire
.
 
<EOS>
such
,
however
,
be
the
state
of
thing
,
Flora
feel
reluctant
to
give
up
the
house
,
where
he
would
be
sure
to
come
to
look
for
her
,
and
her
happiness
be
too
dear
to
Henry
to
induce
him
to
make
any
sacrifice
of
it
to
expediency
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
be
it
that
Bannerworth
Hall
,
as
it
be
sometimes
call
,
be
retain
,
and
fully
intend
to
be
retain
at
all
event
until
after
Charles
Holland
have
make
his
appearance
,
and
his
advice
(
for
he
be
,
by
the
young
people
,
consider
as
one
of
the
family
)
take
,
with
regard
to
what
be
advisable
to
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
with
one
exception
this
be
the
state
of
affair
at
the
hall
,
and
that
exception
relate
to
Mr.
Marchdale
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
distant
relation
of
Mrs.
Bannerworth
,
and
,
in
early
life
,
have
be
sincerely
and
tenderly
attach
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
,
however
,
with
the
want
of
steady
reflection
of
a
young
girl
,
as
she
then
be
,
have
,
as
be
generally
the
case
among
several
admirer
,
choose
the
very
bad
:
that
is
,
the
man
who
treat
her
with
the
most
indifference
,
and
who
pay
her
the
least
attention
,
be
of
course
,
think
the
most
of
,
and
she
give
her
hand
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
that
man
be
Mr.
Bannerworth
.
<EOS>
but
future
experience
have
make
her
thoroughly
awake
to
her
former
error
;
and
,
but
for
the
love
she
bear
her
child
,
who
be
certainly
all
that
a
mother
's
heart
could
wish
,
she
would
often
have
deeply
regret
the
infatuation
which
have
induce
her
to
bestow
her
hand
in
the
quarter
she
have
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
about
a
month
after
the
decease
of
Mr.
Bannerworth
,
there
come
one
to
the
hall
,
who
desire
to
see
the
widow
.
<EOS>
that
one
be
Mr.
Marchdale
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
some
slight
tenderness
towards
him
which
have
never
leave
her
,
or
it
may
be
the
pleasure
merely
of
see
one
whom
she
have
know
intimately
in
early
life
,
but
,
be
that
as
it
may
,
she
certainly
give
him
a
kindly
welcome
;
and
he
,
after
consent
to
remain
for
some
time
as
a
visitor
at
the
hall
,
win
the
esteem
of
the
whole
family
by
his
frank
demeanour
and
cultivate
intellect
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
travel
much
and
see
much
,
and
he
have
turn
to
good
account
all
he
have
see
,
so
that
not
only
be
Mr.
Marchdale
a
man
of
sterling
sound
sense
,
but
he
be
a
most
entertaining
companion
.
 
<EOS>
His
intimate
knowledge
of
many
thing
concern
which
they
know
little
or
nothing
;
his
accurate
mode
of
thought
,
and
a
quiet
,
gentlemanly
demeanour
,
such
as
be
rarely
to
be
meet
with
,
combine
to
make
him
esteem
by
the
Bannerworths
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
small
independence
of
his
own
,
and
be
completely
alone
in
the
world
,
for
he
have
neither
wife
nor
child
,
Marchdale
own
that
he
feel
a
pleasure
in
reside
with
the
Bannerworths
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
he
could
not
,
in
decent
term
,
so
far
offend
them
as
to
offer
to
pay
for
his
subsistence
,
but
he
take
good
care
that
they
should
really
be
no
loser
by
have
him
as
an
inmate
,
a
matter
which
he
could
easily
arrange
by
little
present
of
one
kind
and
another
,
all
of
which
he
manage
should
be
such
as
be
not
only
ornamental
,
but
actually
spare
his
kind
entertainer
some
positive
expense
which
otherwise
they
must
have
go
to
.
 
<EOS>
whether
or
not
this
amiable
piece
of
manoeuvring
be
see
through
by
the
bannerworth
it
be
not
our
purpose
to
inquire
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
see
through
,
it
could
not
lower
him
in
their
esteem
,
for
it
be
probably
just
what
they
themselves
would
have
feel
a
pleasure
in
do
under
similar
circumstance
,
and
if
they
do
not
observe
it
,
Mr.
Marchdale
would
,
probably
,
be
all
the
better
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
such
then
may
be
consider
by
our
reader
as
a
brief
outline
of
the
state
of
affair
among
the
Bannerworths
--
a
state
which
be
pregnant
with
change
,
and
which
change
be
now
likely
to
be
rapid
and
conclusive
.
 
<EOS>
how
far
the
feeling
of
the
family
towards
the
ancient
house
of
their
race
would
be
alter
by
the
appearance
at
it
of
so
fearful
a
visitor
as
a
vampyre
,
we
will
not
stop
to
inquire
,
inasmuch
as
such
feeling
will
develop
themselves
as
we
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
that
the
visitation
have
produce
a
serious
effect
upon
all
the
household
<EOS>
be
sufficiently
evident
,
as
well
among
the
educate
as
among
the
ignorant
.
<EOS>
on
the
second
morning
,
Henry
receive
notice
to
quit
his
service
from
the
three
servant
he
with
difficulty
have
contrive
to
keep
at
the
hall
.
<EOS>
the
reason
why
he
receive
such
notice
he
know
well
enough
,
and
therefore
he
do
not
trouble
himself
to
argue
about
a
superstition
to
which
he
feel
now
himself
almost
,
compel
to
give
way
;
for
how
could
he
say
there
be
no
such
thing
as
a
vampyre
,
when
he
have
,
with
his
own
eye
,
have
the
most
abundant
evidence
of
the
terrible
fact
?
 
<EOS>
He
calmly
pay
the
servant
,
and
allow
them
to
leave
him
at
once
without
at
all
enter
into
the
matter
,
and
,
for
the
time
being
,
some
man
be
procure
,
who
,
however
,
come
evidently
with
fear
and
tremble
,
and
probably
only
take
the
place
,
on
account
of
not
be
able
,
to
procure
any
other
.
<EOS>
the
comfort
of
the
household
be
likely
to
be
completely
put
an
end
to
,
and
reason
now
for
leave
the
hall
appear
to
be
most
rapidly
accumulate
.

Henry
and
his
brother
rouse
Flora
,
and
after
agree
together
that
it
would
be
highly
imprudent
to
say
anything
to
her
of
the
proceeding
of
the
night
,
they
commence
a
conversation
with
her
in
encouraging
and
kindly
accent
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
Flora
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
you
see
you
have
be
quite
undisturbed
to
-
night

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
sleep
long
,
dear
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
,
and
pleasantly
too

I
hope

<EOS>

I
have
not

I

much
refresh

now

quite
well
again

<EOS>
"
thank
Heaven

<EOS>
"
if
you
will
tell
dear
mother
that
I
be
awake
,
I
will
get
up
with
her
assistance
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
brother
leave
the
room
,
and
they
speak
to
each
other
of
it
as
a
favourable
sign
,
that
Flora
do
not
object
to
be
leave
alone
now
,
as
she
have
do
on
the
precede
morning
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
fast
recover
,
now
,
George
,
"
say
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
if
we
could
now
but
persuade
ourselves
that
all
this
alarm
would
pass
away
,
and
that
we
should
hear
no
more
of
it
,
we
may
return
to
our
old
and
comparatively
happy
condition

<EOS>
"
let
us
believe
,
Henry

that
we
shall
.

<EOS>
"

yet
,
George

I
shall
not
be
satisfied
in
my
mind

I
have
pay
a
visit
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
visit
?
<EOS>
where
?

<EOS>
"
to
the
family
vault

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
Henry

<EOS>
I
think
you
have
abandon
that
idea

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
.
<EOS>
I
have
several
time
abandon
it

it
come
across
my
mind
again

again

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
much
regret
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
look
you
,
George
;
as
yet
,
everything
that
have
happen
have
tend
to
confirm
a
belief
in

most
horrible
of

concern
vampyre

<EOS>
"
It
have

now
,
my
great
object

George

be
to
endeavour
to
disturb
such
a
state
of
thing
,
by
get
something
,
however
slight
,
or
of
a
negative
character
,
for
the
mind
to
rest
upon
on
the
other
side
of
the
question

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

I
comprehend
you
,
Henry

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
that
at
present
we
be
not
only
lead
to
believe
,
almost
irresistibly
that
we
have
be
visit
here
by
a
vampyre
but
that
that
vampyre
be
our
ancestor
,
whose
portrait
be
on
the
panel

he
contrive

make
his

true

most
true

then
let
us
,
by
an
examination
of
the
family
vault
,
George
,
put
an
end
to
one
of
the
evidence

<EOS>
if
we
find
,
as
most
surely
we
shall
,
the
coffin
of
the
ancestor

seem

in
dress

so
horribly
mix
up

we

be
at

head

consider
how
many
year
have
elapse

"
yes

a

what
then

do
you
suppose

could
remain

so
long
ago

"
 
<EOS>
"
decomposition
must
of
course
have
do
its
work

still
there
must
be
a
something
to
show

undergo

process

double
the

make
you
any
discovery
?
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
none
whatever
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
no
trace
of
any
one
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
the
least
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
Mr.
Marchdale
,
George
and
I
be
talk
over
this
project
visit
to
the
family
vault
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
we
agree
to
suspend
our
judgment
until
we
see
you
,
and
learn
your
opinion
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
which
I
will
tell
you
frankly
,
"
say
Mr.
Marchdale
,
"
because
I
know
you
desire
it
freely
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
so
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
,
that
you
make
the
visit
.
"
 
"
indeed
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
and
for
this
reason
.
<EOS>
You
have
now
,
as
you
can
not
help
have
,
a
disagreeable
feeling
,
that
you
may
find
that
one
coffin
be
untenanted
.
<EOS>
now
,
if
you
do
find
it
<EOS>
so
,
you
scarcely
make
matter
bad
,
by
an
additional
confirmation
of
what
already
amount
to
a
strong
supposition
,
and
one
which
be
likely
to
grow
strong
by
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
true
,
most
true
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
on
the
contrary
,
if
you
find
indubitable
proof
that
your
ancestor
have
sleep
soundly
in
the
tomb
,
and
go
the
way
of
all
flesh
,
you
will
find
yourself
much
calm
,
and
that
an
attack
be
make
upon
the
train
of
event
which
at
present
all
run
one
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
precisely
the
argument
I
be
use
to
George
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
a
few
moment
since
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
let
us
go
,
"
say
George
,
"
by
all
mean
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
so
decide
then
,
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
it
be
do
with
caution
,
"
reply
Mr.
Marchdale
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
any
one
can
manage
it
,
of
course
we
can
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
should
it
not
be
do
secretly
and
at
night
?
<EOS>
of
course
we
lose
nothing
by
make
a
night
visit
to
a
vault
into
which
daylight
<EOS>
,
I
presume
,
can
not
penetrate
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
certainly
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
let
it
be
at
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
we
shall
surely
require
the
concurrence
of
some
of
the
church
authority
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
I
do
not
see
that
,
"
interpose
Mr.
Marchdale
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
vault
actually
vest
in
and
belong
to
yourself
you
wish
to
visit
,
and
,
therefore
,
you
have
right
to
visit
it
in
any
manner
or
at
any
time
that
may
be
most
suitable
to
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
detection
in
a
clandestine
visit
may
produce
unpleasant
consequence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
church
be
old
,
"
say
George
,
"
and
we
could
easily
find
mean
of
get
into
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
only
one
objection
that
I
see
,
just
now
,
and
that
is
,
that
we
leave
Flora
unprotected
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
do
,
indeed
,
"
say
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
put
to
herself
,
as
a
matter
for
her
own
consideration
,
"
say
Mr.
Marchdale
,
"
if
she
will
consider
herself
sufficiently
safe
with
the
company
and
protection
of
your
mother
only
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
a
pity
<EOS>
be
we
not
all
three
present
at
the
examination
of
the
coffin
,
"
remark
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
there
be
ample
evidence
,
"
say
Mr.
Marchdale
,
"
but
we
must
not
give
Flora
a
night
of
sleeplessness
and
uneasiness
on
that
account
,
and
the
more
particularly
as
we
can
not
well
explain
to
her
where
we
be
go
,
or
upon
what
errand
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
certainly
not
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
let
us
talk
to
her
,
then
,
about
it
,
"
say
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
I
confess
I
be
much
bent
upon
the
plan
,
and
fain
would
not
forego
it
;
neither
should
I
like
other
than
that
we
three
should
go
together
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
determine
,
then
,
upon
it
,
"
say
Marchdale
,
"
we
will
go
to
-
night
;
and
,
from
your
acquaintance
with
the
place
,
doubtless
you
will
be
able
to
decide
what
tool
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
trap
-
door
at
the
bottom
of
the
pew
,
"
say
Henry
;
"
it
be
not
only
secure
down
,
but
it
be
lock
likewise
,
and
I
have
the
key
in
my
possession
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
immediately
beneath
be
a
short
flight
of
stone
step
,
which
conduct
at
once
into
the
vault
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
it
large
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
;
about
the
size
of
a
moderate
chamber
,
and
with
no
intricacy
about
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
can
be
no
difficulty
,
then
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
none
<EOS>
whatever
,
unless
we
meet
with
actual
personal
interruption
,
which
I
be
inclined
to
think
be
very
far
from
likely
.
<EOS>
all
we
shall
require
will
be
a
screwdriver
,
with
which
to
remove
the
screw
,
and
then
something
with
which
to
wrench
open
the
coffin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
those
we
can
easily
provide
,
along
with
light
,
"
remark
Mr.
Marchdale
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
to
Heaven
that
this
visit
to
the
tomb
will
have
the
effect
of
ease
your
mind
,
and
enable
you
to
make
a
successful
stand
against
the
streaming
torrent
of
evidence
that
have
pour
in
upon
us
regard
this
most
fearful
of
apparition
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
indeed
,
hope
so
<EOS>
,
"
add
Henry
;
"
and
now
I
will
go
at
once
to
Flora
,
and
endeavour
to
convince
her
she
be
safe
without
us
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
by
-
the
-
bye
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
"
say
Marchdale
,
"
that
if
we
can
induce
Mr.
Chillingworth
to
come
with
us
,
it
will
be
a
great
point
gain
in
the
investigation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
would
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
be
able
to
come
to
an
accurate
decision
with
respect
to
the
remain
--
if
any
--
in
the
coffin
,
which
we
could
not
.

<EOS>

then
have
him
,
by
all

"

George
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
do
not
seem
averse
last
night
to
go
on
such
an
adventure
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
ask
him
when
he
make
his
visit
this
morning
upon
Flora
;
and
should
he
not
feel
disposed
to
join
us
<EOS>
,
I
be
quite
sure
he
will
keep
the
secret
of
our
visit
.
"
 
<EOS>
all
this
be
arrange
,
Henry
proceed
to
Flora
,
and
tell
her
that
he
and
George
,
and
Mr.
Marchdale
wish
to
go
out
for
about
a
couple
of
hour
in
the
evening
after
dark
,
if
she
feel
sufficiently
well
to
feel
a
sense
of
security
without
them
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
change
colour
,
and
slightly
tremble
,
and
then
,
as
if
ashamed
of
her
fear
,
she
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
go
,
go
;
I
will
not
detain
you
.
<EOS>
surely
no
harm
can
come
to
me
in
presence
of
my
mother
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
not

go
longer
than
the
time
I
mention
to
you
,

Henry

<EOS>

oh
,
I
shall
be
quite
content
.
<EOS>
besides
,
be
I
to
be
keep
thus
in
fear
all
my
life

<EOS>
surely
,
surely
not
.
<EOS>
I
ought
,
too
,
to
learn
to
defend
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
Henry
catch
at
the
idea
,
as
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
if
fire
-
arm
be
leave
you

do
you

you
would
have
courage
to
use
them

<EOS>
"
I
do
,
Henry

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
shall
have
them
;

me
beg
of
you
to
shoot
any

hesitation

shall
come
into
your
chamber

I

,
Henry

being
be
justify
in
the
use
of
deadly
weapon

be
now
.

protect
me
from
a
repetition
of
the
visit
to
which
I
have
now
be
once
subject

rather
,
oh
,
much
rather
would
I
die
a
hundred
death
than
suffer
what
I
have
suffer
.
<EOS>
"

do
not
allow
it
,
dear
Flora
,
to
press
too
heavily
upon
your
mind
in
dwell
upon
it
in
conversation

<EOS>
I
still
entertain
a
sanguine
expectation
that
something
may
arise
to
afford
a
far
less
dreadful
explanation

what
have
occur

what
you
have
put
upon
it

be
of
good
cheer
,
Flora
,
we
shall
go
one
hour
after
sunset
,
and
return
in
about
two
hour
from
the
time
at
which
we
leave
here
,
you
may
be
assure

"
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
ready
and
courageous
acquiescence
of
Flora
in
the
arrangement
,
Henry
be
not
without
his
apprehension
that
when
the
night
should
come
again
,
her
fear
would
return
with
it
;
but
he
speak
to
Mr.
Chillingworth
upon
the
subject
,
and
get
that
gentleman
's
ready
consent
to
accompany
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
promise
to
meet
them
at
the
church
porch
exactly
at
nine
o'clock
,
and
matter
be
all
arrange
,
and
Henry
wait
with
much
eagerness
and
anxiety
now
for
the
coming
night
,
which
he
hope
would
dissipate
one
of
the
fearful
deduction
which
his
imagination
have
draw
from
recent
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
to
Flora
a
pair
of
pistol
of
his
own
,
upon
which
he
know
he
could
depend
,
and
he
take
good
care
to
load
them
well
,
so
that
there
could
be
no
likelihood
whatever
of
their
miss
fire
at
a
critical
moment
.
 
<EOS>
"
now
,
Flora
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
have
see
you
use
fire
-
arm
when
you

much
young

you
be
now

I
need
give
you
no
instruction

<EOS>
if
any
intruder
do
come

you
do
fire

be
sure
you
take
a
good
aim

shoot
low

Henry

I

you

on

deepen
into
night

It

out
to
be
a
cloudy

therefore
the
moon
's
brilliance
be
nothing
near
equal
to
what
it
have
be
on
the
precede
night

still

however

it
have
sufficient
power
over
the

frequently
cover
it
for
many
minute
together

produce
a
considerable
light
effect

consequently
very
far

indeed

a
dark
one

<EOS>
George

Henry

meet
in
one
of
the
low
room
of
the
house
,
previous
to
start
upon
their
expedition

after
satisfy
themselves
that
they

with
them
all
the
tool
that

necessary

well

on

open

door
of

chamber

leave

hall

proceed
at

rapid
pace

the
church

up

some

It

<EOS>
Mr.
Chillingworth
now
come
up
to
them
and
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
before
my

so
rather
than
wait
at
the
church
porch
,
which
would
have
expose
me
to
observation
perhaps
<EOS>
,
I
think
it
better
to
walk
on
,
and
chance
meet
with
you

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
guess
we
should
come
this
way

'
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
and
so
it
turn
out
,
really
.
<EOS>
It
be
unquestionably
your
most
direct
route
to
the
church

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
will
go
back
,

Mr
Marchdale

<EOS>
"
back
!
<EOS>
"
exclaim
the
doctor
;
"
what
for
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
forget
the
mean
of
get
light
.
<EOS>
We
have
candle
,
but
no
means
of
light
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
make
yourself
easy
on
that
score
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
never
without
some
chemical
match
of
my
own
manufacture
,
so
that
as
you
have
the
candle
,
that
can
be
no
bar
to
our
go
on
a
once

"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
fortunate
,
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
very
,
"
add
Marchdale
;
"
for
it
seem
a
mile
's
hard
walk
for
me
,
or
at
least
half
a
mile
from
the
hall
.
<EOS>
let
us
now
push
on
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
do
push
on
,
all
four
walk
at
a
brisk
pace
.
<EOS>
the
church
,
although
it
belong
to
the
village
,
be
not
in
it
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
it
be
situate
at
the
end
of
a
long
lane
,
which
be
a
mile
nearly
from
the
village
,
in
the
direction
of
the
hall
,
therefore
,
in
go
to
it
from
the
hall
,
that
amount
of
distance
be
save
,
although
it
be
always
call
and
consider
the
village
church
.
 
<EOS>
It
stand
alone
,
with
the
exception
of
a
glebe
house
and
two
cottage
,
that
be
occupy
by
person
who
hold
situation
about
the
sacred
edifice
,
and
who
be
suppose
,
be
on
the
spot
,
to
keep
watch
and
ward
over
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
ancient
building
of
the
early
english
style
of
architecture
,
or
rather
Norman
,
with
one
of
those
antique
,
square
,
short
tower
,
build
of
flint
stone
firmly
embed
in
cement
,
which
,
from
time
,
have
acquire
almost
the
consistency
of
stone
itself
.
<EOS>
there
be
numerous
arched
window
,
partake
something
of
the
more
florid
gothic
style
,
although
scarcely
ornamental
enough
to
be
call
such
.
<EOS>
the
edifice
stand
in
the
centre
of
a
grave
-
yard
,
which
extend
over
a
space
of
about
half
an
acre
,
and
altogether
it
be
one
of
the
prettiest
and
most
rural
old
church
within
many
mile
of
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
many
a
lover
of
the
antique
and
of
the
picturesque
,
for
it
be
both
,
go
out
of
his
way
while
travel
in
the
neighbourhood
to
look
at
it
,
and
it
have
an
extensive
and
well
-
deserved
reputation
as
a
fine
speciman
of
its
class
and
style
of
building
.
 
<EOS>
in
Kent
,
to
the
present
day
,
be
some
fine
specimen
of
the
old
roman
style
of
church
,
building
;
and
,
although
they
be
as
rapidly
pull
down
as
the
abuse
of
modern
architect
,
and
the
cupidity
of
speculator
,
and
the
vanity
of
clergyman
can
possibly
encourage
,
in
old
to
erect
flimsy
,
italianised
structure
in
their
stead
,
yet
sufficient
of
them
remain
dotted
over
England
to
interest
the
traveller
.
<EOS>
at
Walesden
there
be
a
church
of
this
description
which
will
well
repay
a
visit
.
<EOS>
this
,
then
,
be
the
kind
of
building
into
which
it
be
the
intention
of
our
four
friend
to
penetrate
,
not
on
an
unholy
,
or
an
unjustifiable
errand
,
but
on
one
which
,
proceed
from
good
and
proper
motive
,
it
be
highly
desirable
to
conduct
in
as
secret
a
manner
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
the
moon
be
more
densely
cover
by
cloud
than
it
have
yet
be
that
evening
,
when
they
reach
the
little
wicket
-
gate
which
lead
into
the
churchyard
,
through
which
be
a
regularly
use
thoroughfare
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
a
favourable
night

remark
Henry
,
"
<EOS>
for
we
be
not
so
likely
to
be
disturb
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
the
question
be
,
how
be
we
to
get
in
?
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
as
he
pause
,
and
glance
up
at
the
ancient
building
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
door
,
"
say
George
,
"
would
effectually
resist
us
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
can
it
be
do
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
only
way
I
can
think
of
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
be
to
get
out
one
of
the
small
diamond
-
shape
pane
of
glass
from
one
of
the
low
window
,
and
then
we
can
one
of
us
put
in
our
hand
,
and
undo
the
fastening
,
which
be
very
simple
,
when
the
window
open
like
a
door
,
and
it
be
<EOS>
but
a
step
into
the
church
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
good
way
,
"
say
Marchdale
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
lose
no
time
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
walk
round
the
church
till
they
come
to
a
very
low
window
indeed
,
near
to
an
angle
of
the
wall
,
where
a
huge
abutment
strike
far
out
into
the
burial
-
ground
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
do
it
,
Henry
?
"
say
George
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
notice
the
fastening
.
<EOS>
just
give
me
a
slight
hoist
up
,
and
all
will
be
right
.
"
 
<EOS>
George
do
so
,
and
Henry
with
his
knife
easily
bend
back
some
of
the
leadwork
which
hold
in
one
of
the
pane
of
glass
,
and
then
get
it
out
whole
.
<EOS>
He
hand
it
down
to
George
,
saying,--
 
<EOS>
"
take
this
,
George
.
<EOS>
We
can
easily
replace
it
when
we
leave
,
so
that
there
can
be
no
sign
leave
of
any
one

be
here
at
all

"
 
<EOS>
George
take
the
piece
of
thick
,
dim
-
coloured
glass
,
and
in
another
moment
Henry
have
succeed
in
open
the
window
,
and
the
mode
of
ingress
to
the
old
church
be
fair
and
easy
before
them
all
,
have
there
be
ever
so
many

<EOS>
"
I
wonder

Marchdale

"
 
<EOS>
"
no

Mr.

<EOS>
"
there

<EOS>
the

cover
with

beyond
that

and
an
old
box
,
in

I
believe
nothing

some

I

Henry

<EOS>
"

be

thus
guide

they
all
get
fairly
into
the
sacred
edifice

then
Henry
close
the
window
,

fasten
it
on
the
inside
as
he
said,--

"
We
have
nothing

that
Heaven
will
pardon
me

Mr.

"
the
secret

there

what

you

there

if

surgery

<EOS>
They
be
all
silent
for
a
few
moment
as
they
look
around
them
with
natural
feeling
of
curiosity
.
<EOS>
two
of
that
party
have
of
course
never
be
in
that
vault
at
all
,
and
the
brother
,
although
they
have
descend
into
it
upon
the
occasion
,
nearly
a
year
before
,
of
their
father
be
place
in
it
,
still
look
upon
it
with
almost
as
curious
eye
as
they
who
now
have
their
first
sight
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
if
a
man
be
at
all
of
a
thoughtful
or
imaginative
cast
of
mind
,
some
curious
sensation
be
sure
to
come
over
him
,
upon
stand
in
such
a
place
,
where
he
know
around
him
lie
,
in
the
calmness
of
death
,
those
in
whose
vein
have
flow
kindre
blood
to
him
--
who
bear
the
same
name
,
and
who
precede
him
in
the
brief
drama
of
his
existence
,
influence
his
destiny
and
his
position
in
life
probably
largely
by
their
action
compound
of
their
virtue
and
their
vice
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
Bannerworth
and
his
brother
George
be
just
the
kind
of
person
to
feel
strongly
such
sensation
.
<EOS>
both
be
reflective
,
imaginative
,
educate
young
man
,
and
,
as
the
light
from
the
wax
candle
flash
upon
their
face
,
it
be
evident
how
deeply
they
feel
the
situation
in
which
they
be
place
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Chillingworth
and
Marchdale
be
silent
.
<EOS>
They
both
know
what
be
pass
in
the
mind
of
the
brother
,
and
they
have
too
much
delicacy
to
interrupt
a
train
of
thought
which
,
although
from
have
no
affinity
with
the
dead
who
lie
around
,
they
could
not
share
in
,
yet
they
respect
.
<EOS>
Henry
at
length
,
with
a
sudden
start
,
seem
to
recover
himself
from
his
reverie
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
time
for
action
,
George
,
"
he
say
,
"
and
not
for
romantic
thought
.
<EOS>
let
us
proceed
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
"
say
George
,
and
he
advance
a
step
towards
the
centre
of
the
vault
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can
you
find
out
among
all
these
coffin
,
for
there
seem
to
be
nearly
twenty
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
"
which
be
the
one
we
seek
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
we
may
,
"
reply
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
some
of
the
early
coffin
of
our
race
,
I
know
,
be
make
of
marble
,
and
other
of
metal
,
both
of
which
material
,
I
expect
,
would
withstand
the
encroache
of
time
for
a
hundred
year
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
let
us
examine
,
"
say
George
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
shelf
or
niche
build
into
the
wall
all
round
,
on
which
the
coffin
be
place
,
so
that
there
could
not
be
much
difficulty
in
a
minute
examination
of
them
all
,
the
one
after
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
when
,
however
,
they
come
to
look
,
they
find
that
"
decay
's
offensive
finger
"
have
be
more
busy
than
they
could
have
imagine
,
and
that
whatever
they
touch
of
the
early
coffin
crumble
into
dust
before
their
very
finger
.
 
<EOS>
in
some
case
the
inscription
be
quite
illegible
,
and
,
in
other
,
the
plate
that
have
bear
them
have
fall
on
to
the
floor
of
the
vault
,
so
that
it
be
impossible
to
say
to
which
coffin
they
belong
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
,
the
more
recent
and
fresh
-
look
coffin
they
do
not
examine
,
because
they
could
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
object
of
that
melancholy
visit
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
arrive
at
no
conclusion
,
"
say
George
.
<EOS>
"
all
seem
to
have
rot
away
among
those
coffin
where
we
may
expect
to
find
the
one
belong
to

Bannerworth
,
our
ancestor
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
here
be
a
coffin
plate
,
"
say
Marchdale
,
take
one
from
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
He
hand
it
to
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
who
,
upon
an
inspection
of
it
,
close
to
the
light
,
<EOS>
exclaimed,--
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
have
belong
to
the
coffin
you
seek

<EOS>

what
say
it

"
 
<EOS>
"
It

Henry
,
"

now
our
search
be
fruitless

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
so
,
indeed
,
"
exclaim
George
,
"
for
how
can
we
tell
to
which
of
the
coffin
that
have
lose
the

this
one
really
belong

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
be
so
hopeless
,
"
say
Marchdale
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
from
time
to
time
,
in
the
pursuit
of
antiquarian
lore
,
which
I
be
once
fond
of
,
enter
many
vault
,
and
I
have
always
observe
that
an
inner
coffin
of
metal
be
sound
and
good
,
while
the
outer
one
of
wood
have
rot
away
,
and
yield
at
once
to
the
touch
of
the
first
hand
that

lay
upon
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
admit
that
to
be
the
case
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
how
do
that
assist
us
in
the
identification
of
a
coffin
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
always
,
in
my
experience
,
find
the
name
and
rank
of
the
deceased
engrave
upon
the
lid
of
the
inner
coffin
,
as
well
as
be
set
forth
in
a
much
more
perishable
manner
on
the
plate
which
be
secure
to
the
outer
one
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
right
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
we
never
think
of
that
.
<EOS>
if
your
ancestor
be
bury
in
a
leaden
coffin
,
there
will
be
no
difficulty
in
find
which
it
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
Henry
seize
the
light
,
and
proceed
to
one
of
the
coffin
,
which
seem
to
be
a
mass
of
decay
,
he
pull
away
some
of
the
rot
wood
work
,
and
then
suddenly
exclaimed,--
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
quite
right
.
<EOS>
here
be
a
firm
strong
leaden
coffin
within
,
which
,
although
quite
black
,
do
not
otherwise
appear
to
have
suffer
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
inscription
on
that
?
"
say
George
.
 
<EOS>
with
difficulty
the
name
on
the
lid
be
decipher
,
but
it
be
find
not
to
be
the
coffin
of
him
whom
they
seek
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
can
make
short
work
of
this
,
"
say
Marchdale
,
"
by
only
examine
those
leaden
coffin
which
have
lose
the
plate
from
off
their
outer
case
.
<EOS>
there
do
not
appear
to
be
many
in
such
a
state
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
,
with
another
light
,
which
he
light
from
the
one
that
Henry
now
carry
,
commence
actively
assist
in
the
search
,
which
be
carry
on
silently
for
more
than
ten
minute
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
Mr.
Marchdale
cry
,
in
a
tone
of
excitement,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
find
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
all
immediately
surround
the
spot
where
he
be
,
and
then
he
point
to
the
lid
of
a
coffin
,
which
he
have
be
rub
with
his
handkerchief
,
in
order
to
make
the
inscription
more
legible
,
and
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
see
.
<EOS>
It
be
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
by
the
combined
light
of
the
candle
they
see
the
words,--
 
<EOS>
"
Marmaduke
Bannerworth
,
Yeoman
,
1640
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
there
can
be
no
mistake
here
,
"
say
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
the
coffin
,
and
it
shall
be
open

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
the
iron
crowbar
here
,
"
say
Marchdale
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
an
old
friend
of
mine

I
be
accustomed

the
use

it

<EOS>
Shall
I
open
the
coffin
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
so
--
do
so
,
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
They
stand
around
in
silence
,
while
Mr.
Marchdale
,
with
much
care
,
proceed
to
open
the
coffin
,
which
seem
of
great
thickness
,
and
be
of
solid
lead
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
probably
the
partial
rotting
of
the
metal
,
in
consequence
of
the
damps
of
that
place
,
that
make
it
easy
to
open
the
coffin
than
it
otherwise
would
have
be
,
but
certain
it
be
that
the
top
come
away
remarkably
easily
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
so
easily
do
it
come
off
,
that
another
supposition
may
have
be
hazard
,
namely
,
that
it
have
never
at
all
be
effectually
fasten

<EOS>
[

the
few
moment
that
elapse
be
one
of
very
great
suspense
to
every
one
there
present
;
and
it
would
,
indeed
,
be
quite
sure
to
assert
,
that
all
the
world
be
for
the
time
forget
in
the
absorb
interest
which
appertain
to
the
affair
which
be
in
progress

<EOS>
the
candle
be
now
both
hold
by
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
and
they
be
so
hold
as
to
cast
a
full
and
clear
light
upon
the
coffin
.
<EOS>
now
the
lid
slide
off
,
and
Henry
eagerly
gaze
into
the
interior
.
 
<EOS>
there
lie
something
certainly
there

an
audible
"

escape
his

<EOS>
"
the

exclaim
George

"
all

say
Marchdale
,
"
here
it

<EOS>
there
be
something

what
else
can
it

"
 
<EOS>
"
hold
the

"
say
Mr.

;
"
hold

some
of
you
;
let
us
be
quite
certain

"
 
<EOS>
George
take
the
light
,
and
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
without
any
hesitation
,
dip
his
hand
at
once
into
the
coffin
,
and
take
up
some
fragment
of
rag
which
be
there
.
<EOS>
They
be
so
rotten
,
that
they
fall
to
piece
in
his
grasp
,
like
so
many
piece
of
tinder
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
death
-
like
pause
for
some
few
moment
,
and
then
Mr.
Chillingworth
say
,
in
a
low
voice,--
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
not
the
least
vestige
of
a
dead
body
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
Henry
give
a
deep
groan
,
as
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
can
you
take
upon
yourself
to
say
that
no
corpse
have
undergo
the
process
of
decomposition
in
this
coffin
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
to
answer
your
question
exactly
,
as
probably
in
your
hurry
you
have
word
it
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
"
I
can
not
take
upon
myself
to
say
any
such
thing
;
but
this
I
can
say
,
namely
,
that
in
this
coffin
there
be
no
animal
remain
,
and
that
it
be
quite
impossible
that
any
corpse
enclose
here
could
,
in
any
lapse
of
time
,
have
so
utterly
and
entirely
disappear

"
I
be
answer
,
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
good
God
!

exclaim
George
,
"
and
have
this
but
add
another
damn
proof

to
those
we
have
already
on
our

of
one
of
the
must
dreadful
superstition
that
ever
the

It
would
seem
so

Marchdale

sadly

that
I
be
dead

dead

so
spare
the

such

possible

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
think
again
,
Mr.
Chillingworth
<EOS>
;
I
pray
you
think
again
,
"
cry
Marchdale
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
I
be
to
think
for
the
remainder
of
my
existence
,
"
he
reply
,
"
I
could
come
to
no
other
conclusion
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
matter
of
opinion
;
it
be
a
matter
of
fact
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
positive
,
then
,

Henry
,
"
that
the
dead

of
Marmaduke
Bannerworth

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
positive

<EOS>
look
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
the
lead
be

slightly
discolour
;
it
look
tolerably
clean

fresh
;
there
be
not
a

of
putrefaction

<EOS>
no
bone

no
dust
even

"
 
<EOS>
They
do
all
look
for
themselves
,
and
the
most
casual
glance
be
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
most
sceptical
.
 
<EOS>
"
all
be
over
,
"
say
Henry
;
"
let
us
now
leave
this
place

and
all
I

My
young
friend
,
I
tell
you
from
the
first
,
that
I
would
not
believe
in
your
vampyre
;
and
I
tell
you
now
,
that
if
one
be
to
come
and
lay
hold
of
me
by
the
throat
,
as
long
as
I
could
at
all
gasp
for
breath
I
would
tell
him
he
be
a
d----d
impostor
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
carry
incredulity
to
the
verge
of
obstinacy
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
far
beyond
it
,
if
you
please
.
"
 
"
You
will
not
be
convince
?
"
say
Marchdale
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
most
decidedly
,
on
this
point
,
will
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
be
one
who
would
doubt
a
miracle
,
if
you
see
it
with
your
own
eye
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
,
because
I
do
not
believe
in
miracle
.
<EOS>
I
should
endeavour
to
find
some
rational
and
some
scientific
mean
of
account
for
the
phenomenon
,
and
that
be
the
very
reason
why
we
have
no
miracle
now
-
a
-
day
,
between
you
and
I
,
and
no
prophet
and
saint
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
avoid
such
observation
in
such
a
place
as
this
,
"
say
Marchdale
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
do
not
be
the
moral
coward
,
"
cry
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
"
to
make
your
opinion
,
or
the
expression
of
them
,
dependent
upon
any
certain
locality
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
what
to
think
,
"
say
Henry
;
<EOS>
"
I
be
bewilder
quite
.
<EOS>
let
us
now
come
away
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Marchdale
replace
the
lid
of
the
coffin
,
and
then
the
little
party
move
towards
the
staircase
.
<EOS>
Henry
turn
before
he
ascend
,
and
glance
back
into
the
vault
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
"
he
say
,
"
if
I
could
but
think
there
have
be
some
mistake
,
some
error
of
judgment
,
on
which
the
mind
could
rest
for
hope
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
deeply
regret
,
"
say
Marchdale
,
"
that
I
so
strenuously
advise
this
expedition
.
<EOS>
I
do
hope
that
from
it
would
have
result
much
good
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
you
have
every
reason
so
to
hope
,
"
say
Chillingworth
.
<EOS>
"
I
advise
it
likewise
,
and
I
tell
you
that
its
result
perfectly
astonish
me
,
although
I
will
not
allow
myself
to
embrace
at
once
all
the
conclusion
to
which
it
would
seem
to
lead
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
satisfied
,
"
say
Henry
;
"
I
know
you
both
advise
me
for
the
good
.
<EOS>
the
curse
of
Heaven
seem
now
to
have
fall
upon
me
and
my
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
nonsense
!
"
say
Chillingworth
.
<EOS>
"
what
for
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
alas
!
<EOS>
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
may
depend
that
Heaven
would
never
act
so
oddly
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
Heaven
do
not
curse
anybody
;
and
,
in
the
second
,
it
be
too
just
to
inflict
pain
where
pain
be
not
amply
deserve
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
ascend
the
gloomy
staircase
of
the
vault
.
<EOS>
the
countenance
of
both
George
and
Henry
be
very
much
sadden
,
and
it
be
quite
evident
that
their
thought
be
by
far
too
busy
to
enable
them
to
enter
into
any
conversation
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
,
and
particularly
George
,
seem
to
hear
all
that
be
say
to
them
.
<EOS>
Their
intellect
seem
almost
stun
by
the
unexpected
circumstance
of
the
disappearance
of
the
body
of
their
ancestor
.
 
<EOS>
all
along
they
have
,
although
almost
unknown
to
themselves
,
feel
a
sort
of
conviction
that
they
must
find
some
remain
of
Marmaduke
Bannerworth
,
which
would
render
the
supposition
,
even
in
the
most
superstitious
mind
,
that
he
be
the
vampyre
,
a
thing
totally
and
physically
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
the
whole
question
assume
a
far
more
bewildering
shape
.
<EOS>
the
body
be
not
in
its
coffin
--
it
have
not
there
quietly
sleep
the
long
sleep
of
death
common
to
humanity
.
<EOS>
where
be
it
then
?
<EOS>
what
have
become
of
it
?
<EOS>
where
,
how
,
and
under
what
circumstance
have
it
be
remove
?
<EOS>
have
it
itself
burst
the
band
that
hold
it
,
and
hideously
stalk
forth
into
the
world
again
to
make
one
of
its
seeming
inhabitant
,
and
keep
up
for
a
hundred
year
a
dreadful
existence
by
such
adventure
as
it
have
consummate
at
the
hall
,
where
,
in
the
course
of
ordinary
human
life
,
it
have
once
live
?
 
<EOS>
all
these
be
question
which
irresistibly
press
themselves
upon
the
consideration
of
Henry
and
his
brother
.
<EOS>
They
be
awful
question
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
,
take
any
sober
,
sane
,
think
,
educated
man
,
and
show
him
all
that
they
have
see
,
subject
him
to
all
to
which
they
have
be
subject
,
and
say
if
human
reason
,
and
all
the
argument
that
the
subtle
brain
could
back
it
with
,
would
be
able
to
hold
out
against
such
a
vast
accumulation
of
horrible
evidence
,
and
say--"I
do
not
believe
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Chillingworth
's
be
the
only
plan
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
argue
the
question
.
<EOS>
He
say
at
once,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
believe
this
thing
--
upon
this
point
I
will
yield
to
no
evidence
whatever
.
"
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
only
way
of
dispose
of
such
a
question
;
but
there
be
not
many
who
could
so
dispose
of
it
,
and
not
one
so
much
interested
in
it
as
be
the
brother
Bannerworth
,
who
could
at
all
hope
to
get
into
such
a
state
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
the
board
be
lay
carefully
down
again
,
and
the
screw
replace
.
<EOS>
Henry
find
himself
unequal
to
the
task
,
so
it
be
do
by
Marchdale
,
who
take
pain
to
replace
everything
in
the
same
state
in
which
they
have
find
it
,
even
to
the
lay
even
the
matting
at
the
bottom
of
the
pew
.
 
<EOS>
then
they
extinguish
the
light
,
and
,
with
heavy
heart
,
they
all
walk
towards
the
window
,
to
leave
the
sacred
edifice
by
the
same
mean
they
have
enter
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
replace
the
pane
of
glass
?
"
say
Marchdale
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
it
matter
not
--
it
matter
not
,
"
say
Henry
,
listlessly
;
"
nothing
matter
now
.
<EOS>
I
care
not
what
become
of
me
--
I
be
get
weary
of
a
life
which
now
must
be
one
of
misery
and
dread
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
allow
yourself
to
fall
into
such
a
state
of
mind
as
this
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
or
you
will
become
a
patient
of
mine
very
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
help
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
but
be
a
man
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
serious
evil
affect
you
,
fight
out
against
them
the
good
way
you
can
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
come
,
now
,
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
We
need
not
,
I
think
,
trouble
ourselves
about
the
pane
of
glass
,
so
come
along
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
take
the
arm
of
Henry
and
walk
on
with
him
a
little
in
advance
of
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Henry
,
"
he
say
,
"
the
good
way
,
you
may
depend
,
of
meeting
evil

be
they
great

small

<EOS>
be
to
get
up
an
obstinate
feeling
of
defiance
against
them

<EOS>
now
,
when
anything
occur
which
be
uncomfortable
to
me
,
I
endeavour
to
convince
myself
,
and
I
have
no
great
difficulty
in
do
so

that
I
be

decidedly
injure
man

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
get
very
angry
,
and
that
get
up
a
kind
of
obstinacy
,
which
make
me
not
feel
half
so
much
mental
misery
as
would
be
my
portion
,
if
I
be
to
succumb
to
the
evil
,

commence
whine
over
it

as
many
people
do

under
the
pretence

be

affliction

mine
transcend
anything

anybody
else
ever
endure

I
do
not
know
that
;
but
it
be
a
view
of
the
subject

,
if
I
be
you
,
would
only
make
me
more
obstinate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
in
the
first
place
,
I
would
say
to
myself
,
'
there
may

there
may
not
be
supernatural
being
,
who
,
from
some
physical
derangement
of

ordinary
nature

make
themselves
obnoxious
to
live
people

if
there
be

d
<EOS>

<EOS>
there
may
be
vampyre
;
and
if
there
be
,
I
defy

'
<EOS>
let
the
imagination
paint
its
very
bad
terror
;
let
fear
do
what
it
will
and
what
it
can
in
people
the
mind
with
horror
.
<EOS>
shrink
from
nothing
,
and
even
then
I
would
defy
them
all

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
not
that
like
defy
Heaven
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
most
certainly
not
;
for
in
all
we
say
and
in
all
we
do
we
act
from
the
impulse
of
that
mind
which
be
give
to
us
by
Heaven
itself

<EOS>
if
Heaven

an
intellect

Heaven
will
not

that
it
do

Henry

because
they

what
I
urge
upon

not

indeed

I

<EOS>
all
that
we
read
about

not

expressly
to
agree

you
may
consider
as
an

,
Mr.

I
can
not

They
may
be
incomprehensible

they
may
be
inconsistent

some
of
them
may
look
ridiculous
;
but
still
they
be
sacred
and
sublime
,
and
I
will
not
renounce
them
although
my
reason
may
not
accord
with
them
,
because
they
be
the
law
of
Heaven
.
"
 
<EOS>
no
wonder
this
powerful
argument
silence
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
who
be
one
of
those
character
in
society
who
hold
most
dreadful
opinion
,
and
who
would
destroy
religious
belief
,
and
all
the
different
sect
in
the
world
,
if
they
could
,
and
endeavour
to
introduce
instead
some
horrible
system
of
human
reason
and
profound
philosophy
.
 
<EOS>
but
how
soon
the
religious
man
silence
his
opponent
;
and
let
it
not
be
suppose
that
,
because
his
opponent
say
no
more
upon
the
subject
,
he
do
so
because
he
be
disgusted
with
the
stupidity
of
the
other

no
,
it
be
because
he
be
completely
beat

have
nothing
more
to
say

<EOS>
the
distance
now
between

nearly

who
be
a
very
good
man

notwithstanding
his
disbelief
in
certain
thing
of

pave
the
way
for
him
to
hell

take
a
kind
leave

call

Henry

,
in
earnest
conversation

proceed
homeward

It
be
evident
that
the
scene
in

CHAPTER

the
occurrence
of
the
NIGHT
<EOS>
at
the
HALL.--THE
SECOND
APPEARANCE
of
the
VAMPYRE

and
the
PISTOL

despite
the
full
and
free
consent
which
Flora
have
give
to
her
brother
to
entrust
her
solely
to
the
care
of
her
mother
and
her
own
courage
at
the
hall
,
she
feel
great
fear
creep
over
her
after
they
be
go
than
she
choose
to
acknowledge
.
 
<EOS>
a
sort
of
presentiment
appear
to
come
over
her
that
some
evil
be
about
to
occur
,
and
more
than
once
<EOS>
she
catch
herself
almost
in
the
act
of
saying,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
they
have
not
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bannerworth
,
too
,
could
not
be
suppose
to
be
entirely
destitute
of
uncomfortable
feeling
,
when
she
come
to
consider
how
poor
a
guard
<EOS>
she
be
over
her
beautiful
child
,
and
how
much
terror
may
even
deprive
of
the
little
power
she
have
,
should
the
dreadful
visitor
again
make
his
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
but
for
two
hour
,
"
think
Flora
,
"
and
two
hour
will
soon
pass
away
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
,
too
,
another
feeling
which
give
her
some
degree
of
confidence
,
although
it
arise
from
a
bad
source
,
inasmuch
as
it
be
one
which
show
powerfully
how
much
her
mind
be
dwell
on
the
particular
of
the
horrible
belief
in
the
class
of
supernatural
being
,
one
of
whom
she
believe
have
visit
her
.
 
<EOS>
that
consideration
be
this
.
<EOS>
the
two
hour
of
absence
from
the
hall
of
its
male
inhabitant
,
would
be
from
nine
o'clock
until
eleven
,
and
those
be
not
the
two
hour
during
which
she
feel
that
she
would
be
most
timid
on
account
of
the
vampyre
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
after
midnight
before
,
"
she
think
,
"
when
it
come
,
and
perhaps
it
may
not
be
able
to
come
earlier
.
<EOS>
It
may
not
have
the
power
,
until
that
time
,
to
make
its
hideous
visit
,
and
,
therefore
,
I
will

then
Mrs.

again
urge
slightly
the
calling

some
of

she
think

give

Flora
see

there
come

perceptibly
upon

to
be
any

at
all
about

a
strange
scratching
noise
upon

outside

a
faint
cry
come
from

only
sit
like
one
paralysed
,
and
unable
to
do
more

listen
to

see
what
be
go
on

<EOS>
the
scratch
noise
continue
for
a
few
second

and
then
altogether
cease

<EOS>
perhaps
,
under
ordinary
circumstance
,
such
a
sound
outside
the
window
would
have
scarcely
afford
food
for
comment
at
all
,
or
,
if
it

it
would

be
attribute

to
the
exertion

but
there
have
occur
now
enough
in

make
any

importance

these

when

Flora

Mrs.

try
to
speak

she
could
not
;
and
then
suddenly
,
with
a
loud
clash
,
the
bar
,
which
on
the
inside
appear
to
fasten
the
shutter
strongly
,
fall
as
if
by
some
invisible
agency

and
the
shutter
now
,
but
for
the
intervention

the
window

could
be
easily
push
open
from

Mrs.

cover
her
face
with
her

,
after
rock
to

fro
for
a
moment

she
fall
off
her
chair
,
have
faint
with
the
excess
of
terror
that
come
over
her

<EOS>
for
about
the
space
of
time
in
which
a
fast
speaker
could
count
twelve
,
Flora
think
her
reason
be
leave
her
,
but
it
do
not
.
<EOS>
She
find
herself
recover
;
and
there
she
sit
,
with
her
eye
fix
upon
the
window
,
look
more
like
some
exquisitely

chisel
statue
of
despair
than
a
being
of
flesh
and
blood
,
expect
each
moment
to
have
its
eye
blast
by
some
horrible
appearance
,
such
as
may
be
suppose
to
drive
her
to
madness
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
again
come
the
strange
knocking
or
scratch
against
the
glass
of
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
this
continue
for
some
minute
,
during
which
it
appear
likewise
to
Flora
that
some
confusion
be
go
on
at
another
part
of
the
house
,
for
she
fancy
she
hear
voice
and
the
banging
of
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
her
as
if
she
must
have
sit
look
at
the
shutter
of
that
window
a
long
time
before
she
see
them
shake
,

then
one
wide
hinge
portion
of
them
slowly
open
.
 
<EOS>
once
again
horror
appear
to
be
on
the
point
of
produce
madness
in
her
brain
,
and
then
,
as
before
,
a
feeling
of
calmness
rapidly
ensue
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
able
to
see
plainly
that
something
be
by
the
window
,
but
what
it
be
she
could
not
plainly
<EOS>
discern
,
in
consequence
of
the
light
she
have
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
a
few
moment
,
however
,
suffice
to
settle
that
mystery
,
for
the
window
be
open
and
a
figure
stand
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
one
glance
,
one
terrified
glance
,
in
which
her
whole
soul
be
concentrate
,
suffice
to
shew
her
who
and
what
the
figure
be
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
tall
,
gaunt
form
--
there
be
the
fade
ancient
apparel
--
the
lustrous
metallic
-
look
eye
--
its
half
-
open
month
,
exhibit
the
tusk

like

It

it

vampyre

<EOS>
It
stand
for
a
moment
gaze
at
her

and
then
in
the
hideous
way
it
have
attempt
before
to
speak
,
it
apparently
endeavour
to
utter
some
word
which
it
could
not
make
articulate
to
human
ear
.
<EOS>
the
pistol
lie
before
Flora
.
<EOS>
mechanically
she
raise
one
,
and
point
it
at
the
figure

<EOS>
It
advance
a
step
,
and
then
she
pull
the
trigger
.
 
<EOS>
a
stunning
report
follow
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
loud
cry
of
pain
,
and
the
vampyre
flee
.
<EOS>
the
smoke
and
the
confusion
that
be
incidental
to
the
spot
prevent
her
from
see
if
the
figure
walk
or
run
away
.
<EOS>
She
think
she
hear
a
crashing
sound
among
the
plant
outside
the
window
,
as
if
it
have
fall
,
but
she
do
not
feel
quite
sure
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
effort
of
any
reflection
,
but
a
purely
mechanical
movement
,
that
make
her
raise
the
other
pistol
,
and
discharge
that
likewise
in
the
direction
the
vampyre
have
take
.
<EOS>
then
cast
the
weapon
away
,
she
rise
,
and
make
a
frantic
rush
from
the
room

<EOS>
She
open
the
door
,
and
be
dash
out
,
when
she
find
herself
catch
in
the
circle
arm
of
some
one

either
have
be
there

or
who
have
just
at

get
there

by
some
mysterious
mean

have
get
there

be
about
to
make
her
his
prey

It
so
happen
that
George

Henry
Bannerworth
,
along

Mr.
Marchdale
,
have
just
reach
the
gate
which
conduct
into
the
garden
of
the
mansion
when
they
all
be
alarm
by
the
report
of
a
pistol
.
<EOS>
amid
the
stillness
of
the
night
,
it
come
upon
them
with
so
sudden
a
shock
,
that
they
involuntarily
pause
,
and
there
come
from
the
lip
of
each
an
expression
of
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
"
good
heaven
!
"
cry
George
,
"
can
that
be
Flora
fire
at
any
intruder
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
,
"
cry
Henry
;
"
she
have
in
her
possession
the
only
weapon
in
the
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Marchdale
turn
very
pale
,
and
tremble
slightly
,
but
he
do
not
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
on
,
on
,
"
cry
Henry
;
"
for
God
's
sake
,
let
us
hasten
on
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
he
speak
,
he
clear
the
gate
at
a
bind
,
and
at
a
terrific
pace
he
make
towards
the
house
,
pass
over
bed
,
and
plantation
,
and
flower
heedlessly
,
so
that
he
go
the
most
direct
way
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
before
,
however
,
it
be
possible
for
any
human
speed
to
accomplish
even
half
of
the
distance
,
the
report
of
the
other
shot
come
upon
his
ear
,
and
he
even
fancy
he
hear
the
bullet
whistle
past
his
head
in
tolerably
close
proximity
.
<EOS>
this
supposition
give
him
a
clue
to
the
direction
at
all
event
from
whence
the
shot
proceed
,
otherwise
he
know
not
from
which
window
they
be
fire
,
because
it
have
not
occur
to
him
,
previous
to
leave
home
,
to
inquire
in
which
room
Flora
and
his
mother
be
likely
to
be
seat
wait
his
return
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
right
as
regard
the
bullet
.
<EOS>
It
be
that
wing
messenger
of
death
which
have
pass
his
head
in
such
very
dangerous
proximity
,
and
consequently
he
make
with
tolerable
accuracy
towards
the
open
window
from
whence
the
shot
have
be
fire
.
 
<EOS>
the
night
be
not
near
so
dark
as
it
have
be
,
although
even
yet
it
be
very
far
from
be
a
light
one
,
and
he
be
soon

to
see
that
there
be
a
room
,
the
window
of
which
be
wide
open
,
and
light
burn
on
the
table
within

<EOS>
He
make
towards
it
in
a
moment
,
and
enter
it
.
<EOS>
to
his
astonishment
,
the
first
object
he
beheld
be
Flora
and
a
stranger
,
who
be
now
support
her
in
his
arm
.
<EOS>
to
grapple
him
by
the
throat
be
the
work
of
a
moment
,
but
the
stranger
cry
aloud
in
a
voice
which
sound
familiar
to
harry,--
 
<EOS>
"
Good
God
,
be
you
all
mad
?
"
 
<EOS>
Henry
relax
his
hold
,
and
look
in
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
gracious
heaven
,
it
be
Mr.
Holland

he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes

do
you

"
 
<EOS>
Henry
be
bewilder

<EOS>
He
stagger
to
a
seat
,
and
,
in
do
so
,
he
see
his
mother
,
stretch
apparently
lifeless
upon
the
floor

<EOS>
to
raise
her

the
work
of
a
moment

and
then
Marchdale
and
George

who
have
follow
him
as
fast
as
they
could

appear
at
the
open
window

a
strange
scene
as
that
small
room

and
on
the
floor
lie
the
two
pistol
,
and
one
of
the
candle
which
have
be
upset
in
the
confusion
;
while
the
terrified
attitude
of
George
and
Mr.
Marchdale
at
the
window
complete
the
strange
-
looking
picture
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
this
--
<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
what

happen

"
cry
George

"
I

I

"
say
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
some
one
summon
the
servant
;
I
be
nearly
mad

"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Marchdale
at
once
ring
the
bell
,
for
George
look
so
faint
and
ill
<EOS>
as
to
be
incapable
of
do
so
;
and
he
ring
it
so
loudly
and
so
effectually
,
that
the
two
servant
who
have
be
employ
suddenly
upon
the
other
<EOS>
leave
come
with
much
speed
to
know
what
be
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
"
see
to
your
mistress
,
"
say
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
dead
,
or
have
faint

<EOS>
for
God
's
sake
,
let
who
can
give
me
some
account
of
what
have
cause
all
this
confusion
here

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
you
aware
,
Henry
,
"
say
Marchdale
,
"
that
a
stranger
be
present
in
the
room
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
point
to
Mr.
Holland
as
he
speak
,
who
,
before
Henry
could
reply
,
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
may
be
a
stranger
to
you
,
as
you
be
to
me
,
and
yet
no
stranger
to
those
whose
home
this
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
you
be
no
stranger
to
us
,
Mr.
Holland
,
but
be
thrice
welcome
--
none
can
be
more
welcome
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Marchdale
,
this
be
Mr
Holland
,
of
whom
you
have
hear
me
speak
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
proud
to
know
you
,
sir
,
"
say
Marchdale
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
thank
you
,
"
reply
Holland
,
coldly
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
so
happen
;
but
,
at
first
sight
,
it
appear
as
if
those
two
person
have
some
sort
of
antagonistic
feeling
towards
each
other
,
which
threaten
to
prevent
effectually
their
ever
become
intimate
friend
.
 
<EOS>
the
appeal
of
Henry
to
the
servant
to
know
if
they
could
tell
him
what
have
occur
be
answer
in
the
negative
.
<EOS>
all
they
know
be
that
they
have
hear
two
shot
fire
,
and
that
,
since
then
,
they
have
remain
where
they
be
,
in
a
great
fright
,
until
the
bell
be
ring
violently
.
<EOS>
this
be
no
news
at
all
and
,
therefore
,
the
only
chance
be
,
to
wait
patiently
for
the
recovery
of
the
mother
,
or
of
Flora
,
from
one
or
the
other
of
whom
<EOS>
surely
some
information
could
be
at
once
then
procure
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bannerworth
be
remove
to
her
own
room
,
and
so
would
Flora
have
be
;
but
Mr.
Holland
,
who
be
support
her
in
his
arm
,
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
the
air
from
the
open
window
be
recover
her
,
and
it
be
likely
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
oh
,
do
not
now
take
her
from
me
,
after
so
long
an
absence
.
<EOS>
Flora

Flora

look
up

do
you

<EOS>
You
have
not

me
one
look
of

<EOS>
Flora
,
dear
Flora

"
 
<EOS>
the
sound
of
his
voice
seem
to
act
as
the
most
potent
of
charm
in
restore
her
to
consciousness
;
it
break
through
the
death
-
like
trance
in
which
she
lie
,
and
,
open
her
beautiful
eye
,
she
fix
them
upon
his

,
saying,--
 
<EOS>
"
yes

yes

"
 
<EOS>
She
burst
into
a
hysterical
flood
of
tear
,
and
clung
to
him
like
some
terrified
child
to
its
only
friend
in

He

he
conceive
of
any

near
the
terrible
strangeness
and
horror
of
that
which
he

consequently
he
find
himself

from

Consternation

and
any

who
have
look
upon
the
feature
of
Charles

,
now
that
he
be
seat
with
Henry
Bannerworth
,
in
expectation
of
a
communication
which
his
fear
tell
him
be
to
blast
all
his
dear
and
most
fondly
cherish
hope
for
ever
,
would
scarce
have
recognise
in
him
the
same
young
man
who
,
one
short
hour
before
,
have
knock
so
loudly
,
and
so
full
of
joyful
hope
and
expectation
,
at
the
door
of
the
hall
.
 
<EOS>
but
so
it
be
.
<EOS>
He
know
Henry
Bannerworth
too
well
to
suppose
that
any
unreal
cause
could
blanch
his
cheek
.
<EOS>
He
know
Flora
too
well
to
imagine
for
one
moment
that
caprice
have
dictate
the
,
to
him
,
fearful
word
of
dismissal

Happier
would
it
at
that
time
have
be
for
Charles
Holland
<EOS>
have
she
act
capriciously
towards
him
,
and
convince
him
that
his
true
heart
's
devotion
have
be
cast
at
the
foot
of
one
unworthy
of
so
really
noble
a
gift
.
<EOS>
pride
would
then
have
enable
him
,
no
doubt
,
successfully
to
resist
the
blow
.
<EOS>
a
feeling
of
honest
and
proper
indignation
at
have
his

trifle
with

would

no

but
,
alas

<EOS>
the
case
seem
widely
different
.
 
<EOS>
true
,
she
implore
him
to
think
of
her
no
more
--
no
longer
to
cherish
in
his
breast
the
fond
dream
of
affection
which
have
be
its
guest
so
long
;
but
the
manner
in
which
she
do
so
bring
along
with
it
an
irresistible
conviction
,
that
she
be
make
a
noble
sacrifice
of
her
own
feeling
for
him
,
from
some
cause
which
be
involve
in
the
profound
mystery

<EOS>
but
now
he
be

<EOS>
Henry

promise

and
as

he
half
dread
the
disclosure
he
yet
pant

to
the
astonished

that
have

,
in
conclusion
,

I
can
not
tell
what
opinion
you
may
come

these
most
singular

recollect
that

the

four

five

beyond

the

something

may
admit
of

this

at

one

Charles
,
Charles
,
be
you
jest
with
me
,
or
do
you
really
give
any
credence
to
the
story
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
friend
,
I
always
make
it
a
rule
to
take
thing
at
their
bad
,
and
then
I
can
not
be
disappoint
.
<EOS>
I
be
content
to
reason
upon
this
matter
as
if
the
fact
of
the
existence
of
a
vampyre
be
thoroughly
establish
,
and
then
to
think
upon
what
be
good
to
be
do
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
right
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
it
should
turn
out
then
that
there
be
an
error
in
the
fact
,
well
and
good
--
we
be
all
the
well
off
;
but
if
otherwise
,
we
be
prepared
,
and
arm
at
all
point
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
let
it
be
so
,
then
.
<EOS>
It
strike
me
,
Charles
,
that
you
will
be
the
cool
and
the
calm
among
us
all
on
this
emergency
;
but
the
hour
now
wax
late
,
I
will
get
them
to
prepare
a
chamber
for
you
,
and
at
least
to
-
night
,
after
what
have
occur
already
,
I
should
think
we
can
be
under
no
apprehension
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
probably
not
.
<EOS>
but
,
Henry
,
if
you
would
allow
me
to
sleep
in
that
room
where
the
portrait
hang
of
him
whom
you
suppose
to
be
the
vampyre
,
I
should
prefer
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
prefer
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
be
not
one
who
court
danger
for
danger
's
sake
,
but
I
would
rather
occupy
that
room
,
to
see
if
the
vampyre
,
who
perhaps
have
a
partiality
for
it
,
will
pay
me
a
visit
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
as
you
please
,
Charles
.
<EOS>
You
can
have
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
same
state
as
when
occupy
by
Flora
.
<EOS>
nothing
have
be
,
I
believe
,
remove
from
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
let
me
,
then
,
while
I
remain
here
,
call
it
my
room
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
assuredly
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
arrangement
be
accordingly
make
to
the
surprise
of
all
the
household
,
not
one
of
whom
would
,
indeed
,
have
sleep
,
or
attempt
to
sleep
there
for
any
amount
of
reward
.
<EOS>
but
Charles
Holland
have
his
own
reason
for
prefer
that
chamber
,
and
he
be
conduct
to
it
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
by
Henry

look
around
it
with
a
shudder

bid

CHAPTER
XII
.
 
<EOS>
CHARLES
HOLLAND
's
<EOS>
SAD
feelings.--the
portrait.--the
OCCURRENCE
of
the
NIGHT
<EOS>
at
the
HALL
.
  
<EOS>
[
illustration
]
 
<EOS>
Charles
Holland
wish
to
be
alone
,
if
ever
any
human
being
have
wish
fervently
to
be
so
.
<EOS>
His
thought
be
most
fearfully
oppressive
.
 
<EOS>
the
communication
that
have
be
make
to
him
by
Henry
Bannerworth
,
have
about
it
too
many
strange
,
confirmatory
circumstance
to
enable
him
to
treat
it
,
in
his
own
mind
,
with
the
disrespect
that
some
mere
freak
of
a
distracted
and
weak
imagination
would
,
most
probably
,
have
receive
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
find
Flora
in
a
state
of
excitement
which
could
arise
only
from
some
such
terrible
cause
as
have
be
mention
by
her
brother
,
and
then
he
be
,
from
an
occurrence
which
certainly
never
could
have
enter
into
his
calculation
,
ask
to
forego
the
bright
dream
of
happiness
which
he
have
hold
so
long
and
so
rapturously
to
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
how
truly
he
find
that
the
course
of
true
love
run
not
smooth
;
and
yet
how
little
would
any
one
have
suspect
that
from
such
a
cause
as
that
which
now
oppress
his
mind
,
any
obstruction
would
arise
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
may
have
be
fickle
and
false
;
he
may
have
see
some
other
fairer
face
,
which
may
have
enchain
his
fancy
,
and
weave
for
him
a
new
heart
's
chain
;
death
may
have
step
between
him
and
the
realization
of
his
fond
hope
;
loss
of
fortune
may
have
make
the
love
cruel
which
would
have
yoke
to
its
distress
a
young
and
beautiful
girl
,
rear
in
the
lap
of
luxury
,
and
who
be
not
,
even
by
those
who
love
her
,
suffer
to
feel
,
even
in
later
year
,
any
of
the
pinch
necessity
of
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
all
these
thing
be
possible
--
some
of
them
be
probable
;
and
yet
none
of
them
have
occur
.
<EOS>
She
love
him
still
;
and
he
,
although
he
have
look
on
many
a
fair
face
,
and
bask
in
the
sunny
smile
of
beauty
,
have
never
for
a
moment
forget
her
faith
,
or
lose
his
devotion
to
his
own
dear
english
girl
.
 
<EOS>
Fortune
he
have
enough
for
both
;
death
have
not
even
threaten
to
rob
him
of
the
prize
of
such
a
noble
and
faithful
heart
which
he
have
win
.
<EOS>
but
a
horrible
superstition
have
arise
,
which
seem
to
place
at
once
an
impassable
abyss
between
them
,
and
to
say
to
him
,
in
a
voice
of
thunder
denunciation,--
 
"
Charles
Holland
,
will
you
have
a
vampyre
for
your
bride
?
"
 
<EOS>
the
thought
be
terrific
.
<EOS>
He
pace
the
gloomy
chamber
to
and
fro
with
rapid
stride
,
until
the
idea
come
across
his
mind
that
by
so
do
he
may
not
only
be
proclaim
to
his
kind
entertainer
how
much
he
be
mentally
distract
,
but
he
likewise
may
be
seriously
distract
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
moment
this
occur
to
him
he
sit
down
,
and
be
profoundly
still
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
He
then
glance
at
the
light
which
have
be
give
to
him
,
and
he
find
himself
almost
unconsciously
engage
in
a
mental
calculation
as
to
how
long
it
would
last
him
in
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
half
ashamed
,
then
,
of
such
terror
,
as
such
a
consideration
would
seem
to
indicate
,
he
be
on
the
point
of
hastily
extinguish
it
,
when
he
happen
to
cast
his
eye
on
the
now
mysterious
and
highly
interesting
portrait
in
the
panel
.
 
<EOS>
the
picture
,
as
a
picture
,
be
well
do
,
whether
it
be
a
correct
likeness
or
not
of
the
party
whom
it
represent
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
those
kind
of
portrait
that
seem
so
life
-
like
,
that
,
as
you
look
at
them
,
they
seem
to
return
your
gaze
fully
,
and
even
to
follow
you
with
their
eye
from
place
to
place
.
 
<EOS>
by
candle
-
light
such
an
effect
be
more
likely
to
become
striking
and
remarkable
than
by
daylight
;
and
now
,
as
Charles
Holland
shade
his
own
eye
from
the
light
,
so
as
to
cast
its
full
radiance
upon
the
portrait
,
he
feel
wonderfully
interested
in
its
life
-
like
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
"
here
be
true
skill
,
"
he
say
;
"
such
as
I
have
not
before
see
.
<EOS>
how
strangely
this
likeness
of
a
man
whom
I
never
see
seem
to
gaze
upon
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
unconsciously
,
too
,
he
aid
the
effect
,
which
he
justly
enough
call
life
-
like
,
by
a
slight
movement
of
the
candle
,
such
as
any
one
not
bless
with
nerve
of
iron
would
be
sure
to
make
,
and
such
a
movement
make
the
face
look
as
if
it
be
inspire
with
vitality
.
 
<EOS>
Charles
remain
look
at
the
portrait
for
a
considerable
period
of
time
.
<EOS>
He
find
a
kind
of
fascination
in
it
which
prevent
him
from
draw
his
eye
away
from
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
fear
which
induce
him
to
continue
gaze
on
it
,
but
the
circumstance
that
it
be
a
likeness
of
the
man
who
,
after
death
,
be
suppose
to
have
borrow
so
new
and
so
hideous
an
existence
,
combine
with
its
artistic
merit
,
chain
him
to
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
now
,
"
he
say
,
"
know
that
face
again
,
let
me
see
it
where
I
may
,
or
under
what
circumstance
I
may
.
<EOS>
each
feature
be
now
indelibly
fix
upon
my
memory
--
I
never
can
mistake
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
turn
aside
as
he
utter
these
word
,
and
as
he
do
<EOS>
so
his
eye
fall
upon
a
part
of
the
ornamental
frame
which
compose
the
edge
of
the
panel
,
and
which
seem
to
him
to
be
of
a
different
colour
from
the
surround
portion
.
 
<EOS>
Curiosity
and
increase
interest
prompt
him
at
once
to
make
a
close
inquiry
into
the
matter
;
and
,
by
a
careful
and
diligent
scrutiny
,
he
be
almost
induce
to
come
to
the
positive
opinion
,
that
it
no
very
distant
period
in
time
past
,
the
portrait
have
be
remove
from
the
place
it
occupy
.
 
<EOS>
when
once
this
idea
,
even
vague
and
indistinct
as
it
be
,
in
consequence
of
the
slight
ground
he
form
it
on
,
have
get
possession
of
his
mind
,
he
feel
most
anxious
to
prove
its
verification
or
its
fallacy
.
 
<EOS>
He
hold
the
candle
in
a
variety
of
situation
,
so
that
its
light
fall
in
different
way
on
the
picture
;
and
the
more
he
examine
it
,
the
more
he
feel
convinced
that
it
must
have
be
move
lately
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
appear
as
if
,
in
its
removal
,
a
piece
of
the
old
oaken
carve
framework
of
the
panel
have
be
accidentally
break
off
,
which
cause
the
new
look
of
the
fracture
,
and
that
this
accident
,
from
the
nature
of
the
broken
bit
of
framing
,
could
have
occur
in
any
other
way
than
from
an
actual
or
attempt
removal
of
the
picture
,
he
feel
be
extremely
unlikely
.
 
<EOS>
He
set
down
the
candle
on
a
chair
near
at
hand
,
and
try
if
the
panel
be
fast
in
its
place
.
<EOS>
upon
the
very
first
touch
,
he
feel
convinced
it
be
not
so
,
and
that
it
easily
move
.
<EOS>
how
to
get
it
out
,
though
,
present
a
difficulty
,
and
to
get
it
out
be
tempt
.
 
<EOS>
"
who
know
,
"
he
say
to
himself
,
"
what
may
be
behind
it
?
<EOS>
this
be
an
old
baronial
sort
of
hall
,
and
the
great
portion
of
it
be
,
no
doubt
,
build
at
a
time
when
the
construction
of
such
place
as
hide
chamber
and
intricate
staircase
be
,
in
all
building
of
importance
,
consider
a
disiderata
.
"
 
<EOS>
that
he
should
make
some
discovery
behind
the
portrait
,
now
become
an
idea
that
possess
him
strongly
,
although
he
certainly
have
no
definite
ground
for
really
suppose
that
he
should
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
the
wish
be
more
father
to
the
thought
than
he
,
in
the
partial
state
of
excitement
he
be
in
,
really
imagine
;
but
so
it
be
.
<EOS>
He
feel
convinced
that
he
should
not
be
satisfied
until
he
have
remove
that
panel
from
the
wall
,
and
see
what
be
immediately
behind
it
.
 
<EOS>
after
the
panel
contain
the
picture
have
be
place
where
it
be
,
it
appear
that
piece
of
moulding
have
be
insert
all
around
,
which
have
have
the
effect
of
keep
it
in
its
place
,
and
it
be
a
fracture
of
one
of
these
piece
which
have
first
call
Charles
Holland
's
attention
to
the
probability
of
the
picture
have
be
remove
.
<EOS>
that
he
should
have
to
get
two
,
at
least
,
of
the
piece
of
mould
away
,
before
he
could
hope
to
remove
the
picture
,
be
to
him
quite
apparent
,
and
he
be
consider
how
he
should
accomplish
such
a
result
,
when
he
be
suddenly
startle
by
a
knock
at
his
chamber
door
.
 
<EOS>
until
that
sudden
demand
for
admission
at
his
door
come
,
he
scarcely
know
to
what
a
nervous
state
he
have
work
himself
up
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
odd
sort
of
tap
--
one
only
--
a
single
tap
,
as
if
some
one
demand
admittance
,
and
wish
to
awaken
his
attention
with
the
least
possible
chance
of
disturb
any
one
else
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
in
,
"
say
Charles
,
for
he
know
he
have
not
fasten
his
door
;
"
come
in
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
reply
,
but
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
the
same
sort
of
low
tap
come
again
.
 
<EOS>
again
he
cry
"
come
in
,
"
but
,
whoever
it
be
,
seem
determined
that
the
door
should
be
open
for
him
,
and
no
movement
be
make
from
the
outside
.
<EOS>
a
third
time
the
tap
come
,
and
Charles
be
very
close
to
the
door
when
he
hear
it
,
for
with
a
noiseless
step
he
have
approach
it
intend
to
open
it
.
<EOS>
the
instant
this
third
mysterious
demand
for
admission
come
,
he
do
open
it
wide
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
one
there
!
<EOS>
in
an
instant
he
cross
the
threshold
into
the
corridor
,
which
run
right
and
leave
.
<EOS>
a
window
at
one
end
of
it
now
send
in
the
moon
's
ray
,
so
that
it
be
tolerably
light
,
but
he
could
see
no
one
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
to
look
for
any
one
,
he
feel
sure
be
needless
,
for
he
have
open
his
chamber
-
door
almost
simultaneously
with
the
last
knock
for
admission
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
strange
,
"
he
say
,
as
he
linger
on
the
threshold
of
his
room
door
for
some
moment
;
"
my
imagination
could
not
so
completely
deceive
me
.
<EOS>
there
be
most
certainly
a
demand
for
admission
.
"
 
<EOS>
slowly
,
then
,
he
return
to
his
room
again
,
and
close
the
door
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
one
thing
be
evident
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
if
I
be
in
this
apartment
to
be
subject
to
these
annoyance
,
I
shall
get
no
rest
,
which
will
soon
exhaust
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
thought
be
a
very
provoking
one
,
and
the
more
he
think
that
he
should
ultimately
find
a
necessity
for
give
up
that
chamber
he
have
himself
ask
as
a
special
favour
to
be
allow
to
occupy
,
the
more
vexed
he
become
to
think
what
construction
may
be
put
upon
his
conduct
for
so
do
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
will
all
fancy
me
a
coward
,
"
he
think
,
"
and
that
I
dare
not
sleep
here
.
<EOS>
They
may
not
,
of
course
,
say
so
,
but
they
will
think
that
my
appear
so
bold
be
one
of
those
act
of
bravado
which
I
have
not
courage
to
carry
fairly
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
take
this
view
of
the
matter
be
just
the
way
to
enlist
a
young
man
's
pride
in
stay
,
under
all
circumstance
,
where
he
be
,
and
,
with
a
slight
accession
of
colour
,
which
,
even
although
he
be
alone
,
would
visit
his
cheek
,
Charles
Holland
say
aloud,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
remain
the
occupant
of
this
room
<EOS>
come
what
may
,
happen
what
may
.
<EOS>
no
terror
,
real
or
unsubstantial
,
shall
drive
me
from
it
:
I
will
brave
them
all
,
and
remain
here
to
brave
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
Tap
come
the
knock
at
the
door
again
,
and
now
,
with
more
an
air
of
vexation
than
fear
,
Charles
turn
again
towards
it
,
and
listen
.
<EOS>
tap
in
another
minute
again
succeed
,
and
much
annoyed
,
he
walk
close
to
the
door
,
and
lay
his
hand
upon
the
lock
,
ready
to
open
it
at
the
precise
moment
of
another
demand
for
admission
be
make
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
to
wait
long
.
<EOS>
in
about
half
a
minute
it
come
again
,
and
,
simultaneously
with
the
sound
,
the
door
fly
open
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
one
to
be
see
;
but
,
as
he
open
the
door
,
he
hear
a
strange
sound
in
the
corridor
--
a
sound
which
scarcely
could
be
call
a
groan
,
and
scarcely
a
sigh
,
but
seem
a
compound
of
both
,
have
the
agony
of
the
one
combine
with
the
sadness
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
from
what
direction
it
come
he
could
not
at
the
moment
decide
,
but
he
call
out,--
 
<EOS>
"
who
be
there
?
<EOS>
who
be
there
?
"
 
<EOS>
the
echo
of
his
own
voice
alone
answer
him
for
a
few
moment
,
and
then
he
hear
a
door
open
,
and
a
voice
,
which
he
know
to
be
Henry
's
,
cried,--
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
?
<EOS>
who
speak
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Henry
,
"
say
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
--
yes
--
yes
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
I
have
disturb
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
be
disturb
yourself
,
or
you
would
not
have
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
with
you
in
a
moment
.
"
 
<EOS>
Henry
close
his
door
before
Charles
Holland
could
tell
him
not
to
come
to
him
,
as
he
intend
to
do
,
for
he
feel
ashamed
to
have
,
in
a
manner
of
speak
,
summon
assistance
for
so
trifle
a
cause
of
alarm
as
that
to
which
he
have
be
subject
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
could
not
go
to
Henry
's
chamber
to
forbid
him
from
come
to
his
,
and
,
more
vexed
than
before
,
he
retire
to
his
room
again
to
await
his
coming
.
 
<EOS>
He
leave
the
door
open
now
,
so
that
Henry
Bannerworth
,
when
he
have
get
on
some
article
of
dress
,
walk
in
at
once
,
saying,--
 
<EOS>
"
what
have
happen
,
Charles
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
mere
trifle
,
Henry
,
concern
which
I
be
ashamed
you
should
have
be
at
all
disturb
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
never
mind
that
,
I
be
wakeful
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hear
a
door
open
,
which
keep
me
listen
,
but
I
could
not
decide
which
door
<EOS>
it
be
till
I
hear
your
voice
in
the
corridor
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
it
be
this
door
;
and
I
open
it
twice
in
consequence
of
the
repeat
tap
for
admission
that
come
to
it
;
some
one
have
be
knock
at
it
,
and
,
<EOS>
when
I
go
to
it
,
lo
!
<EOS>
I
can
see
nobody
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
!

<EOS>
[

<EOS>

such
be
the
case

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
surprise
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
sorry
to
have
disturb
you
,
because
,
upon
such
a
ground
,
I
do
not
feel
that
I
ought
to
have
do
so
;
and
,
when
I
call
out
in
the
corridor
,
I
assure
you
it
be
with
no
such
intention
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
do
not
regret
it
for
a
moment
,
"
say
Henry
;
"
you
be
quite
justified
in
make
an
alarm
on
such
an
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
strange
enough
,
but
still
it
may
arise
from
some
accidental
cause
;
admit
,
if
we
do
but
know
it
,
of
some
ready
enough
explanation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
,
certainly
,
but
,
after
what
have
happen
already
,
we
may
well
suppose
a
mysterious
connexion
between
any
unusual
sight
or
sound
,
and
the
fearful
one
we
have
already
see
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
we
may
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
earnestly
that
strange
portrait
seem
to
look
upon
us
,
Charles
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
do
,
and
I
have
be
examine
it
carefully
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
have
be
remove
lately
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
remove
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
think
,
as
far
as
I
can
judge
,
that
it
have
be
take
from
its
frame
;
I
mean
,
that
the
panel
on
which
it
be
paint
have
be
take
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
touch
it
you
will
find
it
loose
,
and
,
upon
a
close
examination
,
you
will
perceive
that
a
piece
of
the
moulding
which
hold
it
in
its
place
have
be
chip
off
,
which
be
do
in
such
a
place
that
I
think
it
could
only
have
arise
during
the
removal
of
the
picture
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
mistake
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
,
of
course
,
take
upon
myself
,
Henry
,
to
say
precisely
such
be
the
case
,
"
say
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
there
be
no
one
here
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
I
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
Will
you
permit
me
and
assist
me
to
remove
it
?
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
curiosity
to
know
what
be
behind
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
have
,
I
certainly
will
do
so
.
<EOS>
We
think
of
take
it
away
altogether
,
but
when
Flora
leave
this
room
the
idea
be
give
up
as
useless
.
<EOS>
remain
here
a
few
moment
,
and
I
will
endeavour
to
find
something
which
shall
assist
us
in
its
removal
.
"
 
<EOS>
Henry
leave
the
mysterious
chamber
in
order
to
search
in
his
own
for
some
mean
of
remove
the
frame
-
work
of
the
picture
,
so
that
the
panel
would
slip
easily
out
,
and
while
he
be
go
,
Charles
Holland
continue
gaze
upon
it
with
great
interest
,
if
possible
,
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
Henry
return
,
and
although
what
he
have
succeed
in
finding
be
very
inefficient
implement
for
the
purpose
,
yet
with
this
aid
the
two
young
man
set
about
the
task
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
say
,
and
say
truly
enough
,
that
"
where
there
be
a
will
there
be
a
way
,
"
and
although
the
young
man
have
no
tool
at
all
adapt
for
the
purpose
,
they
do
succeed
in
remove
the
moulding
from
the
side
of
the
panel
,
and
then
by
a
little
tap
at
one
end
of
it
,
and
use
a
knife
at
a
lever
at
the
other
end
of
the
panel
,
they
get
it
fairly
out
.
 
<EOS>
disappointment
be
all
they
get
for
their
pain
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
side
there
be
nothing
but
a
rough
wooden
wall
,
against
which
the
fine
and
more
nicely
finish
oak
panelling
of
the
chamber
rest
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
mystery
here
,
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
none
whatever
,
"
say
Charles
,
as
he
tap
the
wall
with
his
knuckle
,
and
find
it
all
hard
and
sound
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
foiled
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
be
indeed
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
strange
presentiment
,
now
,
"
add
Charles
,
"
that
we
should
make
some
discovery
that
would
repay
us
for
our
trouble
.
<EOS>
It
appear
,
however
,
that
such
be
not
to
be
the
case
;
for
you
see
nothing
present
itself
to
us
but
the
most
ordinary
appearance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
perceive
as
much
;
and
the
panel
itself
,
although
of
more
than
ordinary
thickness
,
be
,
after
all
,
but
a
bit
of
planed
oak
,
and
apparently
fashioned
for
no
other
object
than
to
paint
the
portrait
on
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
true
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
replace
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
Charles
reluctantly
assent
,
and
the
picture
be
replace
in
its
original
position
.
<EOS>
We
say
Charles
reluctantly
assent
,
because
,
although
he
have
now
have
ocular
demonstration
that
there
be
really
nothing
behind
the
panel
but
the
ordinary
woodwork
which
may
have
be
expect
from
the
construction
of
the
old
house
,
yet
he
could
not
,
even
with
such
a
fact
stare
him
in
the
face
,
get
rid
entirely
of
the
feeling
that
have
come
across
him
,
to
the
effect
that
the
picture
have
some
mystery
or
another
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
yet
satisfied
,
"
say
Henry
,
as
he
observe
the
doubtful
look
of
Charles
Holland
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
,
"
say
Charles
,
"
I
will
not
deceive
you
.
<EOS>
I
be
much
disappointed
that
we
have
make
no
discovery
behind
that
picture
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
know
we
have
mystery
enough
in
our
family
,
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
even
as
he
speak
they
be
both
startle
by
a
strange
clatter
noise
at
the
window
,
which
be
accompany
by
a
shrill
,
odd
kind
of
shriek
,
which
sound
fearful
and
preternatural
on
the
night
air
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
?
"
say
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
"
God
only
know
,
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
young
man
naturally
turn
their
earnest
gaze
in
the
direction
of
the
window
,
which
we
have
before
remark
<EOS>
be
one
unprovide
with
shutter
,
and
there
,
to
their
intense
surprise
,
they
see
,
slowly
rise
up
from
the
low
part
of
it
,
what
appear
to
be
a
human
form
.
<EOS>
Henry
would
have
dash
forward
,
but
Charles
restrain
him
,
and
draw
quickly
from
its
case
a
large
holster
pistol
,
he
level
it
carefully
at
the
figure
,
say
in
a
whisper,--
 
<EOS>
"
Henry
,
if
I
do
not
hit
it
,
I
will
consent
to
forfeit
my
head
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
pull
the
trigger
--
a
loud
report
follow
--
<EOS>
the
room
be
fill
with
smoke
,
and
then
all
be
still
.
<EOS>
a
circumstance
,
however
,
have
occur
,
as
a
consequence
of
the
concussion
of
air
produce
by
the
discharge
of
the
pistol
,
which
neither
of
the
young
man
have
for
the
moment
calculate
upon
,
and
that
be
the
putting
out
of
the
only
light
they
there
have
.
 
<EOS>
in
spite
of
this
circumstance
,
Charles
,
the
moment
he
have
discharge
the
pistol
,
drop
it
and
spring
forward
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
but
here
he
be
perplex
,
for
he
could
not
find
the
old
fashioned
,
intricate
fastening
which
hold
it
shut
,
and
he
have
to
call
to
<EOS>
henry,--
 
<EOS>
"
Henry
!
<EOS>
for
God
's
sake
open
the
window
for
me
,
Henry
!
<EOS>
the
fastening
of
the
window
be
know
to
you
,
but
not
to
me
.
<EOS>
open
it
for
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
thus
call
upon
,
Henry
spring
forward
,
and
by
this
time
the
report
of
the
pistol
have
effectually
alarm
the
whole
household
.
<EOS>
the
flashing
of
light
from
the
corridor
come
into
the
room
,
and
in
another
minute
,
just
as
Henry
succeed
in
get
the
window
wide
open
,
and
Charles
Holland
have
make
his
way
on
to
the
balcony
,
both
George
Bannerworth
and
Mr.
Marchdale
enter
the
chamber
,
eager
to
know
what
have
occur
.
<EOS>
to
their
eager
question
Henry
replied,--
 
<EOS>
"
ask
me
not
now
;
"
and
then
call
to
Charles
,
he
said,--"remain
where
you
be
,
Charles
,
while
I
run
down
to
the
garden
immediately
beneath
the
balcony
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
--
yes
,
"
say
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
make
prodigious
haste
,
and
be
in
the
garden
immediately
below
the
bay
window
in
a
wonderfully
short
space
of
time
.
<EOS>
He
speak
to
Charles
,
saying,--
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
now
descend
?
<EOS>
I
can
see
nothing
here
;
but
we
will
both
make
a
search
.
"
 
<EOS>
George
and
Mr.
Marchdale
be
both
now
in
the
balcony
,
and
they
would
have
descend
likewise
,
but
Henry
said,--
 
"
do
not
all
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
God
only
know
,
now
,
situate
as
we
be
,
what
may
happen
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
remain
,
then
,
"
say
George
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
sit
up
to
-
night
as
the
guard
,
and
,
therefore
,
may
as
well
continue
to
do
so
.
"
 
<EOS>
Marchdale
and
Charles
Holland
clamber
over
the
balcony
,
and
easily
,
from
its
insignificant
height
,
drop
into
the
garden
.
<EOS>
the
night
be
beautiful
,
and
profoundly
still
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
breath
of
air
sufficient
to
stir
a
leaf
on
a
tree
,
and
the
very
flame
of
the
candle
which
Charles
have
leave
burn
in
the
balcony
burn
clearly
and
steadily
,
be
perfectly
unruffle
by
any
wind
.
 
<EOS>
It
cast
a
sufficient
light
close
to
the
window
to
make
everything
very
plainly
visible
,
and
it
be
evident
at
a
glance
that
no
object
be
there
,
although
have
that
figure
,
which
Charles
shoot
at
,
and
no
doubt
hit
,
be
flesh
and
blood
,
it
must
have
drop
immediately
below
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
look
up
for
a
moment
after
a
cursory
examination
of
the
ground
,
Charles
exclaimed,--
 
<EOS>
"
look
at
the
window
!
<EOS>
as
the
light
be
now
situate
,
you
can
see
the
hole
make
in
one
of
the
pane
of
glass
by
the
passage
of
the
bullet
from
my
pistol
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
do
look
,
and
there
the
clear
,
round
hole
,
without
any
starring
,
which
a
bullet
discharge
close
to
a
pane
of
glass
will
make
in
it
,
be
clearly
and
plainly
discernible
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
hit
him
,
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
one
would
think
so
,
"
say
Charles
;
"
for
that
be
the
exact
place
where
the
figure
be
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
there
be

CHAPTER
XIII
.
 
<EOS>
the
OFFER
for
the
hall.--the
VISIT
to
SIR
FRANCIS
varney.--the
STRANGE
resemblance.--a
<EOS>
dreadful
suggestion
.
  
<EOS>
[
illustration
]
 
<EOS>
the
party
make
a
strict
search
through
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
garden
,
but
it
prove
to
be
a
fruitless
one
:
not
the
least
trace
of
any
one
could
be
find
.
<EOS>
there
be
only
one
circumstance
,
which
be
ponder
over
deeply
by
them
all
,
and
that
be
that
,
beneath
the
window
of
the
room
in
which
Flora
and
her
mother
sit
while
the
brother
be
on
their
visit
to
the
vault
of
their
ancestor
,
be
visible
mark
of
blood
to
a
considerable
extent
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
remember
that
Flora
have
fire
a
pistol
at
the
spectral
appearance
,
and
that
immediately
upon
that
it
have
disappear
,
after
utter
a
sound
which
may
well
be
construe
into
a
cry
of
pain
from
a
wound
.
 
<EOS>
that
a
wound
then
have
be
inflict
upon
some
one
,
the
blood
beneath
the
window
now
abundantly
testify
;
and
when
it
be
discover
,
Henry
and
Charles
make
a
very
close
examination
indeed
of
the
garden
,
to
discover
what
direction
the
wound
figure
,
be
it
man
or
vampyre
,
have
take
.
 
<EOS>
[
illustration
]
 
<EOS>
but
the
close
scrutiny
do
not
reveal
to
them
a
single
spot
of
blood
,
beyond
the
space
immediately
beneath
the
window;--there
<EOS>
the
apparition
seem
to
have
receive
its
wound
,
and
then
,
by
some
mysterious
mean
,
to
have
disappear
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
weary
with
the
continue
excitement
,
combine
with
want
of
sleep
,
to
which
they
have
be
subject
,
they
return
to
the
hall
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
,
with
the
exception
of
the
alarm
she
experience
from
the
firing
of
the
pistol
,
have
meet
with
no
disturbance
,
and
that
,
in
order
to
spare
her
painful
reflection
,
they
tell
her
be
merely
do
as
a
precautionary
measure
,
to
proclaim
to
any
one
who
may
be
lurk
in
the
garden
that
the
inmate
of
the
house
be
ready
to
defend
themselves
against
any
aggression
.
 
<EOS>
whether
or
not
she
believe
this
kind
deceit
they
know
not
.
<EOS>
She
only
sigh
deeply
,
and
weep
.
<EOS>
the
probability
be
,
that
she
more
than
suspect
the
vampyre
have
make
another
visit
,
but
they
forbore
to
press
the
point
;
and
,
leave
her
with
her
mother
,
Henry
and
George
<EOS>
go
from
her
chamber
again
--
the
former
to
endeavour
to
seek
some
repose
,
as
it
would
be
his
turn
to
watch
on
the
succeed
night
,
and
the
latter
to
resume
his
station
in
a
small
room
close
to
Flora
's
chamber
,
where
it
have
be
agree
watch
and
ward
should
be
keep
by
turn
while
the
alarm
last
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
the
morning
again
dawn
upon
that
unhappy
family
,
and
to
none
be
its
beam
more
welcome
.
 
<EOS>
the
bird
sing
their
pleasant
carol
beneath
the
window
.
<EOS>
the
sweet
,
deep
-
coloured
autumnal
sun
shine
upon
all
object
with
a
golden
luster
;
and
to
look
abroad
,
upon
the
beam
face
of
nature
,
no
one
could
for
a
moment
suppose
,
except
from
sad
experience
,
that
there
be
such
thing
as
gloom
,
misery
,
and
crime
,
upon
the
earth
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
must
I
,
"
say
Henry
,
as
he
gaze
from
a
window
of
the
hall
upon
the
undulating
park
,
the
majestic
tree
,
the
flower
,
the
shrub
,
and
the
many
natural
beauty
with
which
the
place
be
<EOS>
full,--"must
<EOS>
I
be
chase
from
this
spot
,
the
home
of
my
self
and
of
my
kindre
,
by
a
phantom
--
<EOS>
must
I
indeed
seek
refuge
elsewhere
,
because
my
own
home
have
become
hideous
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
a
cruel
and
a
painful
thought
!
<EOS>
It
be
one
<EOS>
he
yet
would
not
,
could
not
be
convince
be
absolutely
necessary
.
<EOS>
but
now
the
sun
be
shine
:
it
be
morning
;
and
the
feeling
,
which
find
a
home
in
his
breast
amid
the
darkness
,
the
stillness
,
and
the
uncertainty
of
night
,
be
chase
away
by
those
glorious
beam
of
sunlight
,
that
fall
upon
hill
,
valley
,
and
stream
,
and
the
thousand
sweet
sound
of
life
and
animation
that
fill
that
sunny
air
!
 
<EOS>
such
a
revulsion
of
feeling
be
natural
enough
.
<EOS>
many
of
the
distress
and
mental
anxiety
of
night
vanish
with
the
night
,
and
those
which
oppress
the
heart
of
Henry
Bannerworth
be
considerably
modify
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
engage
in
these
reflection
when
he
hear
the
sound
of
the
lodge
bell
,
and
as
a
visitor
be
now
somewhat
rare
at
this
establishment
,
he
wait
with
some
anxiety
to
see
to
whom
he
be
indebte
for
so
early
a
call
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
a
few
minute
,
one
of
the
servant
come
to
him
with
a
letter
in
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
bear
a
large
handsome
seal
,
and
,
from
its
appearance
,
would
seem
to
have
come
from
some
personage
of
consequence
.
<EOS>
a
second
glance
at
it
shew
him
the
name
of
"
Varney
"
in
the
corner
,
and
,
with
some
degree
of
vexation
,
he
mutter
to
himself
,
 
<EOS>
"
another
condole
epistle
from
the
troublesome
neighbour

I

not
yet

<EOS>
"

the
servant
who
have

him
the
letter

two
night

<EOS>
the
question
be
a
superfluous
<EOS>
one--
:
<EOS>
too
well
he
know
what
the
woman
mean
,
and
the
conviction
come
across
his
mind
strongly
that
no
domestic
would
consent
to
live
long
in
a
house
which
be
subject
to
such
dreadful
visitation
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
I
mean
!
"
say
the
woman,--"why
,
sir
,
if
it
be
all
the
same
to
you
,
I
do
not
myself
come
of
a
wampyre
family

and
I
do
not
choose
to
remain
in

there

what

to
you

"

I
only
come
here
by
the

"
oh
,
indeed

I
be
sure
I
do

"
 
<EOS>
this
woman
be
one
of
those
who
be
always
armed
at
all
point
for
a
row
,
and
she
have
no
notion
of
conclude
any
engagement
,
of
any
character
whatever
,
without
some
disturbance
;
therefore
,
to
see
Henry
take
what
she
say
with
such
provoking
calmness
be
aggravate
in
the
extreme
;
but
there
be
no
help
for
such
a
source
of
vexation
.
<EOS>
She
could
find
no
other
ground
of
quarrel
than
what
be
connect
with
the
vampyre
,
and
,
as
Henry
would
not
quarrel
with
her
on
such
a
score
,
she
be
compel
to
give
it
up
in
despair
.
 
<EOS>
when
Henry
find
himself
alone
,
and
free
from
the
annoyance
of
this
woman
,
he
turn
his
attention
to
the
letter
he
hold
in
his
hand
,
and
which
,
from
the
autograph
in
the
corner
,
he
know
come
from
his
new
neighbour
,
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
whom
,
by
some
chance
or
another
,
he
have
never
yet
see

<EOS>
to
his
great
surprise
,
he
find
that
the
letter
contain
the
follow
words:--
      
Dear
Sir,--"As
a
neighbour
,
by
purchase
of
an
estate
contiguous
     
to
your
own
,
I
be
quite
sure
you
have
excuse
,
and
take
in
good
     
part
,
the
cordial
offer
I
make
to
you
of
friendship
and
service
     
<EOS>
some
short
time
since
<EOS>
;
but
now
,
in
address
to
you
a
distinct
     
proposition
,
I
trust
I
shall
meet
with
an
indulgent
     
consideration
,
whether
such
proposition
be
accordant
with
your
     
view
or
not
.
      
<EOS>
"
what
I
have
hear
from
common
report
induce
me
to
believe
that
     
Bannerworth
Hall
can
not
be
a
desirable
residence
for
yourself
,
or
     
your
amiable
sister
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
right
in
that
conjecture
,
and
you
     
have
any
serious
thought
of
leave
the
place
,
I
would
earnestly
     
recommend
you
,
as
one
have
some
experience
in
such
description
     
of
property
,
to
sell
it
at
once
.
      
<EOS>
"
now
,
the
proposition
with
which
I
conclude
this
letter
be
,
I
     
know
,
of
a
character
to
make
you
doubt
the
disinterestedness
of
     
such
advice
;
but
that
it
be
disintereste
,
nevertheless
,
be
a
     
fact
of
which
I
can
assure
my
own
heart
,
and
of
which
I
beg
to
     
assure
you
.
<EOS>
I
propose
,
then
,
should
you
,
upon
consideration
,
     
decide
upon
such
a
course
of
proceed
,
to
purchase
of
you
the
     
Hall
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
ask
for
a
bargain
on
account
of
any
extraneous
     
circumstance
which
may
at
the
present
time
depreciate
the
value
     
of
the
property
,
but
I
be
willing
to
give
a
fair
price
for
it
.
     
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
,
I
trust
,
sir
,
that
you
will
give
a
     
kindly
consideration
to
my
offer
,
and
even
if
you
reject
it
,
I
     
hope
that
,
as
neighbour
,
we
may
live
long
in
peace
and
amity
,
     
and
in
the
interchange
of
those
good
office
which
should
subsist
     
between
us
.
<EOS>
await
your
reply

me

after
have
read
this
most
unobjectionable
letter
through

fold
it
up
again
,

place
it
in
his
pocket

<EOS>
clasp
his
hand

then
,
behind
his

a

he
pace

deep
thought

how
strange

he
mutter

It
seem
that
every
circumstance
combine
to
induce

It

"
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
apparent
connexion

much
puzzle
Henry

He
walk
to

nearly
an
hour

he
hear
a
hasty
footstep
approach

upon
look

he
see
Mr.

I
suppose

as
he
open
the

it
be
another

I
grieve

from

I
must
confess

Marchdale

that
to
my

it

the
infliction

have
experience
from
the
strange
visitor

who
seem

It

ay

<EOS>
in
another

Henry

yes

reflect

Henry

for
a
moment
upon
the
length

which
you

out
so
dangerous
an
argument

<EOS>
It
be
say
that
vampyre
be
make
by
vampyre
suck
the
blood
of
those
who
,
but
for
that
circumstance
,
would
have
die
and
go
to
decay
in
the
tomb
along
with
ordinary
mortal

that
be
so
attack
during

they
themselves
,
after
death

become
such

in

completely

mentally

physically

from

such

produce
no

from

yourself

produce

a

anger
I

find

difficult

<EOS>
"
It
have
often
be
my
misfortune
through

"
say
Mr.

,
sadly
,
"
to
give
the
great
offence
where
I
feel

out

would
be
fatal

help

They
say

way

to
fix
him
to

so
that
he

CHAPTER

.
 
<EOS>
the
OLD
ADMIRAL
and
his
servant.--the
COMMUNICATION
from
the
LANDLORD
of
the

[

while
those
matter
of
most
grave
and
serious
import
be
go
on
at
the
Hall
,
while
each
day
,
and
almost
each
hour
in
each
day
,
be
produce
more
and
more
conclusive
evidence
upon
a
matter
which
at
first
have
seem
too
monstrous
to
be
at
all
credit
,
it
may
well
be
suppose
what
a
wonderful
sensation
be
produce
among
the
gossip
-
monger
of
the
neighbourhood
by
the
exaggerated
report
that
have
reach
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
servant
,
who
have
leave
the
Hall
on
no
other
account
,
as
they
declare
,
but
sheer
fright
at
the
awful
visit
of
the
vampyre
,
spread
the
news
far
and
wide
,
so
that
in
the
adjoining
village
and
market
-
town
the
vampyre
of
Bannerworth
Hall
become
quite
a
staple
article
of
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
positive
godsend
for
the
lover
of
the
marvellous
have
not
appear
in
the
country
side
within
the
memory
of
that
sapient
individual
--
the
old
inhabitant
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
moreover
,
there
be
one
thing
which
stagger
some
people
of
well
education
and
maturer
judgment
,
and
that
be
,
that
the
more
they
take
pain
to
inquire
into
the
matter
,
in
order
,
if
possible
,
to
put
an
end
to
what
they
consider
a
gross
lie
from
the
commencement
,
the
more
evidence
they
find
to
stagger
their
own
sense
upon
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
everywhere
then
,
in
every
house
,
public
as
well
as
private
,
something
be
be
continually
say
of
the
vampyre
.
<EOS>
nursery
maid
begin
to
think
a
vampyre
vastly
superior
to
"
old
scratch
and
old
bogie
"
as
a
means
of
terrify
their
infant
charge
into
quietness
,
if
not
to
sleep
,
until
they
themselves
become
too
much
afraid
upon
the
subject
to
mention
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
nowhere
be
gossip
carry
on
upon
the
subject
with
more
systematic
fervour
than
at
an
inn
call
the
Nelson
's
arm
,
which
be
in
the
high
street
of
the
near
market
town
to
the
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
it
seem
as
if
the
lover
of
the
horrible
make
a
point
of
hold
their
head
quarter
,
and
so
thirsty
do
the
numerous
discussion
make
the
guest
,
that
the
landlord
be
hear
to
declare
that
he
,
from
his
heart
,
really
consider
a
vampyre
as
very
nearly
equal
to
a
contest
election
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
towards
evening
of
the
same
day
that
Marchdale
and
Henry
make
their
visit
to
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
that
a
postchaise
draw
up
to
the
inn
we
have
mention
.
<EOS>
in
the
vehicle
be
two
person
of
exceedingly
dissimilar
appearance
and
general
aspect
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
these
people
be
a
man
who
seem
fast
verging
upon
seventy
year
of
age
,
although
,
from
his
still
ruddy
and
embrowned
complexion
and
stentorian
voice
,
it
be
quite
evident
he
intend
yet
to
keep
time
at
arm's
-
length
for
many
year
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
attire
in
ample
and
expensive
clothing
,
but
every
article
have
a
naval
animus
about
it
,
if
we
may
be
allow
such
an
expression
with
regard
to
clothing
.
<EOS>
on
his
button
be
an
anchor
,
and
the
general
assortment
and
colour
of
the
clothing
as
nearly
assimilate
as
possible
to
the
undress
naval
uniform
of
an
officer
of
high
rank
some
fifty
or
sixty
year

<EOS>
the
MEETING
of
the
lover
in
the
garden.--an
AFFECTING
<EOS>
scene.--the
sudden
appearance
of
SIR
<EOS>
FRANCIS
VARNEY
.
  
<EOS>
[

Our
reader
will
recollect
that
Flora
Bannerworth
have
make
an
appointment
with
Charles
Holland
in
the
garden
of
the
hall
.
<EOS>
this
meeting
be
look
forward
to
by
the
young
man
with
a
variety
of
conflicting
feeling
,
and
he
pass
the
intermediate
time
in
a
most
painful
state
of
doubt
as
to
what
would
be
its
result
.
 
<EOS>
the
thought
that
he
should
be
much
urge
by
Flora
to
give
up
all
thought
of
make
her
his
,
be
a
most
bitter
one
to
him
,
who
love
her
with
so
much
truth
and
constancy
,
and
that
she
would
say
all
she
could
to
induce
such
a
resolution
in
his
mind
<EOS>
he
feel
certain
.
<EOS>
but
to
him
the
idea
of
now
abandon
her
present
itself
in
the
bad
of
aspect
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
,
"
he
say
,
"
sink
so
low
in
my
own
estimation
,
as
well
as
in
hers
,
and
in
that
of
all
honourable
-
minded
person
,
as
to
desert
her
now
in
the
hour
of
affliction
?
<EOS>
dare
<EOS>
I
be
so
base
as
actually
or
virtually
to
say
to
her
,
'
Flora
,
when
your
beauty
be
undimmed
by
sorrow
--
when
all
around
you
seem
life
and
joy
,
I
love
you
selfishly
for
the
increased
happiness
which
you
may
bestow
upon
me
;
but
now
the
hand
of
misfortune
press
heavily
upon
you
--
you
be
not
what
you
be
,
and
I
desert
you
?
<EOS>
never
--
never
--
never
!
"
 
<EOS>
Charles
Holland
,
it
will
be
see
by
some
of
our
more
philosophic
neighbour
,
feel
more
acutely
than
he
reason
;
but
let
his
error
of
argumentation
be
what
they
may
,
can
we
do
other
than
admire
the
nobility
of
soul
which
dictate
such
a
self
deny
generous
course
as
that
he
be
pursue
?
 
<EOS>
as
for
Flora
,
Heaven
only
know
if
at
that
precise
time
her
intellect
have
completely
stand
the
test
of
the
try
event
which
have
nearly
overwhelm
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
grand
feeling
that
seem
to
possess
her
mind
be
fear
of
the
renew
visit
of
the
vampyre
,
and
an
earnest
desire
to
release
Charles
Holland
from
his
repeat
vow
of
constancy
towards
her
.
 
<EOS>
feeling
,
generosity
,
and
judgment
,
all
revolt
hold
a
young
man
to
such
a
destiny
as
hers
.
<EOS>
to
link
him
to
her
fate
,
would
be
to
make
him
to
a
real
extent
a
sharer
in
it
,
and
the
more
she
hear
fall
from
his
lip
in
the
way
of
generous
feeling
of
continue
attachment
to
her
,
<EOS>
the
more
severely
do
she
feel
that
he
would
suffer
most
acutely
if
unite
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
be
right
.
<EOS>
the
very
generosity
of
feeling
which
would
have
now
prompt
Charles
Holland
to
lead
Flora
Bannerworth
to
the
altar
,
even
with
the
mark
of
the
vampyre
's
tooth
upon
her
throat
,
give
an
assurance
of
a
depth
of
feeling
which
would
have
make
him
an
ample
haven
in
all
her
misery
,
in
all
her
distress
and
affliction
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
familiarly
in
the
family
at
the
Hall
call
the
garden
,
be
a
semicircular
piece
of
ground
shade
in
several
direction
by
tree
,
and
which
be
exclusively
devote
to
the
growth
of
flower
.
<EOS>
the
piece
of
ground
be
nearly
hide
from
the
view
of
the
house
,
and
in
its
centre
be
a
summer
-
house
,
which
at
the
usual
season
of
the
year
be
cover
with
all
kind
of
creep
plant
of
exquisite
perfume
,
and
rare
beauty
.
<EOS>
all
around
,
too
,
bloom
the
fair
and
sweetest
of
flower
,
which
a
rich
soil
and
a
sheltered
situation
could
produce
.
 
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
though
,
of
late
many
weed
have
straggle
up
among
their
more
estimable
floral
culture
,
for
the
decayed
fortune
of
the
family
have
prevent
them
from
keep
the
necessary
servant
,
to
place
the
Hall
and
its
ground
in
a
state
of
neatness
,
such
as
it
have
once
be
the
pride
of
the
inhabitant
of
the
place
to
see
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
in
this
flower
-
garden
that
Charles
and
Flora
use
to
meet
.
 
<EOS>
as
may
be
suppose
,
he
be
on
the
spot
before
the
appoint
hour
,
anxiously
expect
the
appearance
of
her
who
be
so
really
and
truly
dear
to
him
.
<EOS>
what
to
him
be
the
sweet
flower
that
there
grow
in
such
happy
luxuriance
and
heedless
beauty
?
<EOS>
alas
,
the
flower
that
to
his
mind
be
fair
than
them
all
,
be
blight
,
and
in
the
wan
cheek
of
her
whom
he
love
,
he
sigh
to
see
the
lily
usurp
the
place
of
the
radiant
rise
.
 
<EOS>
"
dear
,
dear
Flora
,
"
he
ejaculate
,
"
you
must
indeed
be
take
from
this
place
,
which
be
so
full
of
the
most
painful
remembrance
;
now
,
I
can
not
think
that
Mr.
Marchdale
somehow
be
a
friend
to
me
,
but
that
conviction
,
or
rather
impression
,
do
not
paralyze
my
judgment
sufficiently
to
induce
me
not
to
acknowledge
that
his
advice
be
good
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
couch
it
in
pleasanter
word
--
word
that
would
not
,
like
dagger
,
each
have
bring
a
deadly
pang
home
to
my
heart
,
but
still
I
do
think
that
in
his
conclusion
he
be
right
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
a
light
sound
,
as
of
some
fairy
footstep
among
the
flower
,
come
upon
his
ear
,
and
turn
instantly
to
the
direction
from
whence
the
sound
proceed
<EOS>
,
he
see
what
his
heart
have
previously
assure
him
of

,
that
it

his
Flora

be
come

how
pale

how
wan

how
languid

full
of
the
evidence

much
mental
suffering

all
she
could
say
,
and
then
she
burst
into
a
flood
of
tear
,
and
leant
so
heavily
upon
his
arm
,
that
it
be
evident
but
for
that
support
she
must
have
fall
.
 
<EOS>
Charles
Holland
welcome
those
,
although
,
they
grieve
him
so
much
that
he
could
have
accompany
them
with
his
own
,
but
then
he
know
that
she
would
be
soon
now
more
composed
,
and
that
they
would
relieve
the
heart
whose
sorrow
call
them
into
existence
.
 
<EOS>
He
forbear
to
speak
to
her
until
he
find
this
sudden
gush
of
feeling
be
subside
into
sobs
,
and
then
in
low
,
soft
accent
,
he
again
endeavour
to
breathe
comfort
to
her
afflict
and
terrified
spirit
.

trance

joy

do
not

now

look
into

ARRIVAL

CONFUSION

SOME
of

[

so
sudden
and
so
utterly
unexpected
a
cry
of
alarm
from
Flora
,
at
such
a
time
may
well
have
the
effect
of
astound
the
nerve
of
any
one
,
and
no
wonder
that
Charles
be
for
a
few
second
absolutely
petrified
and
almost
unable
to
think
.
 
<EOS>
mechanically
,
then
,
he
turn
his
eye
towards
the
door
of
the
summer
-
house
,
and
there
he
see
a
tall
,
thin
man
,
rather
elegantly
dress
,
whose
countenance
certainly
,
in
its
wonderful
resemblance
to
the
portrait
on
the
panel
,
may
well
appal
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
the
stranger
stand
in
the
irresolute
attitude
on
the
threshold
of
the
summer
-
house
of
one
who
do
not
wish
to
intrude
,
but
who
find
it
as
awkward
,
if
not
more
so
now
,
to
retreat
than
to
advance
.
 
<EOS>
before
Charles
Holland
could
summon
any
word
to
his
aid
,
or
think
of
free
himself
from
the
cling
grasp
of
Flora
,
which
be
wind
around
him
,
the
stranger
make
a
very
low
and
courtly
bow
,
after
which
he
say
,
in
win
accents,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
very
much
fear
that
I
be
an
intruder
here
.
<EOS>
allow
me
to
offer
my
warm
apology
,
and
to
assure
you
,
sir
,
and
you
,
madam
,
that
I
have
no
idea
any
one
be
in
the
arbour
.
<EOS>
You
perceive
the
rain
be
fall
smartly
,
and
I
make
towards
here
,
see
it
be
likely
to
shelter
me
from
the
shower
.
"
 
<EOS>
these
word
be
speak
in
such
a
plausible
and
courtly
tone
of
voice
,
that
they
may
well
have
become
any
drawing
-
room
in
the
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
keep
her
eye
fix
upon
him
during
the
utterance
of
these
word
;
and
as
she
convulsively
clutch
the
arm
of

the

hush

It
speak
again

"
 
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
ought
to
account
for
my
appearance
in
the
garden
at
all
,

add
the
insinuate
stranger

"
the
fact

,
I
come
on

Flora

"
to
Mr.

continue
the
stranger
;

find
the
garden
-
gate
open
,
I
come
in
without
trouble
the
servant

which
I
much
regret
,
as
I
can
perceive
I
have
alarm

annoy
the
lady

Madam

pray
accept
of
my
apology

in

yes

You

Sir

so
fearful
a

go
on

I
be
all
attention

"
 
"
to
a
portrait
here
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
<EOS>
now
I
reflect
a
moment
,
Mr.
Henry
Bannerworth
do
incidentally
mention
something
of
the
sort
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
most
singular
coincidence
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
sound
of
approach
footstep
be
now
plainly
hear
,
and
in
a
few
moment
Henry
and
George
,
along
with
Mr.
Marchdale
,
reach
the
spot
.
<EOS>
Their
appearance
show
that
they
have
make
haste
,
and
<EOS>
Henry
at
once
exclaimed,--
 
<EOS>
"
We
hear
,

fancy
we
hear
,
a
cry
of
alarm

"
 
<EOS>

You

you

It

<EOS>
Varney
bow
to
the
new
comer
,

be
altogether
as
much
at
his
ease
as
everybody
else
seem
quite
the
contrary

<EOS>
even
Charles
Holland
find
the
difficulty
of
go
up
to
such
a
well
-
breed
,
gentlemanly
man
,
and
say
,
"
Sir
,
we
believe
you
to
be
a
vampyre"--to
be
almost
,
if
not
insurmountable
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not

it

he

You

Sir

of

You

,
very

<EOS>

<EOS>
calm
yourself

calm
yourself

recollect
that
all
we

to
go
upon
in
this
matter
be
a
resemblance

which
,
after
all
,
may
be
accidental
.
<EOS>
but
leave
it
all
to
me
,
and
be
assure
that
now
I
have
some
clue
to
this
affair
,
I
will
not
lose
sight
of
it
,
or
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
Charles
surrender
Flora
to
the
care
of
her
mother
,
and
then
be
hasten
back
to
the
summer
-
house
,
when
he
meet
the
whole
party
come
towards
the
Hall
,
for
the
rain
<EOS>
be
each
moment
increase
in
intensity
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
be
return
,
"
remark
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
with
a
half
bow
and
a
smile
,
to
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
"
allow
me
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
to
introduce
you
,
Mr.
Holland
,
to
our
neighbour
,
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Charles
feel
himself
compel
to
behave
with
courtesy
,
although
his
mind
be
so
full
of
conflict
feeling
as
regard
Varney
;
but
there
be
no
avoiding
,
without
such
brutal
rudeness
as
be
inconsistent
with
all
his
pursuit
and
habit
,
reply
in
something
like
the
same
strain
to
the
extreme
courtly
politeness
of
the
suppose
vampyre
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
watch
him
closely
,
"
think
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
do
no
more
than
watch
him
closely
.
"
 
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
seem
to
be
a
man
of
the
most
general
and
discursive
information
.
<EOS>
He
talk
fluently
and
pleasantly
upon
all
sort
of
topic
,
and
notwithstanding
he
could
not
but
have
hear
what
Flora
have
say
of
him
,
he
ask
no
question
<EOS>
whatever
upon
that
subject
.
 
<EOS>
this
silence
as
regard
a
matter
<EOS>
which
would
at
once
have
induce
some
sort
of
inquiry
from
any
other
man
,
Charles
feel
tell
much
against
him
,
and
he
tremble
to
believe
for
a
moment
that
,
after
all
,
it
really
may
be
true
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
he
a
vampyre
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
himself
.
"
<EOS>
be
there
vampyre
,
and
be
this
man
of
fashion
--
this
courtly
,
talented
,
educate
gentleman
one
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
be
a
perfectly
hideous
question
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
charmingly
situate
here
,
"
remark
Varney
,
as
,
after
ascend
the
few
step
that
lead
to
the
hall
door
,
he
turn
and
look
at
the
view
from
that
slight
altitude
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
place
have
be
much
esteem
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
for
its
picturesque
beauty
of
scenery
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
well
it
may
be
.
<EOS>
I
trust
,
Mr.
Holland
,
the
young
lady
be
much
well
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
,
sir
,
"
say
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
honour
by
an
introduction
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
fault
,
"
say
Henry
,
who
speak
to
his
extraordinary
guest
with
an
air
of
force
hilarity
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
fault
for
not
introduce
you
to
my
sister
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
that
be
your
sister
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Report
have
not
belie
her
--
she
be
beautiful
.
<EOS>
but
she
look
rather
pale
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
have
she
bad
health
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
good
of
health
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
<EOS>
perhaps
the
little
disagreeable
circumstance
,
which
be
make
so
much
food
for
gossip
in
the
neighbourhood
,
have
affect
her
spirit
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
have
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
allude
to
the
suppose
visit
here
of
a
vampyre
?
"
say
Charles
,
as
he
fix
his
eye
upon
Varney
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
allude
to
the
supposed
appearance
of
a
suppose
vampyre
in
this
family
,
"
say
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
as
he
return
the
earnest
gaze
of
Charles
,
with
such
unshrinking
assurance
,
that
the
young
man
be
compel
,
after
about
a
minute
,
nearly
to
withdraw
his
own
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
will
not
be
cow
,
"
think
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
Use
have
make
him
familiar
to
such
cross
-
questioning
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
appear
now
suddenly
to
occur
to
Henry
that
he
have
say
something
at
Varney
's
own
house
which
should
have
prevent
him
from
come
to
the
Hall
,
and
he
now
remarked,--
 
<EOS>
"
We
scarcely
expect
the
pleasure
of
your
company
here
,
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
my
dear
sir
,
I
be
aware
of
that
;
but
you
rouse
my
curiosity
.
<EOS>
You
mention
to
me
that
there
be
a
portrait
here
amazingly
like
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
I
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
you
do
,
or
how
could
I
know
it
?
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
if
the
resemblance
be
so
perfect
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
hear
,
sir
,
"
add
Henry
,
"
that
my
sister
be
alarm
at
your
likeness
to
that
portrait
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
really
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
pray
you
walk
in
,
and
we
will
talk
more
at
large
upon
that
matter
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
with
great
pleasure
.
<EOS>
one
lead
a
monotonous
life
in
the
country
,
when
compare
with
the
brilliancy
of
a
court
existence
.
<EOS>
just
now
I
have
no
particular
engagement
.
<EOS>
as
we
be
near
neighbour
I
see
no
reason
why
we
should
not
be
good
friend
,
and
often
interchange
such
civility
as
make
up
the
amenity
of
existence
,
and
which
,
in
the
country
,
more
particularly
,
be
valuable
.
"
 
<EOS>
Henry
could
not
be
hypocrite
enough
to
assent
to
this
;
but
still
,
under
the
present
aspect
of
affair
,
it
be
impossible
to
return
any
but
a
civil
reply
;
<EOS>
so
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
of
course
--
certainly
.
<EOS>
My
time
be
very
much
occupy
,
and
my
sister
and
mother
see
no
company
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
now
,
how
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Wrong
,
sir
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
surely
.
<EOS>
if
anything
more
than
another
tend
to
harmonize
individual
,
it
be
the
society
of
that
fair
half
of
the
creation
which
we
love
for
their
very
foible
.
<EOS>
I
be
much
attach
to
the
soft
sex
--
to
young
person
full
of
health
.
<EOS>
I
like
to
see
the
rosy
check
,
where
the
warm
blood
mantle
in
the
superficial
vein
,
and
all
be
loveliness
and
life
.
"
 
<EOS>
Charles
shrink
back
,
and
the
word
"
Demon
"
unconsciously
escape
his
lip
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
take
no
manner
of
notice
of
the
expression
,
but
go
on
talk
,
as
if
he
have
be
on
the
very
happy
term
with
every
one
present
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
follow
me
,
at
once
,
to
the
chamber
where
the
portrait
hang
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
or
will
you
partake
of
some
refreshment
first
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
refreshment
for
me
,
"
say
Varney
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
,
if
you
will
permit
me
to
call
you
such
,
this
be
a
time
of
the
day
at
which
I
never
do
take
any
refreshment
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
nor
at
any
other
,
"
think
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
go
to
the
chamber
where
Charles
have
pass
one
very
disagreeable
night
,
and
when
they
arrive
,
Henry
point
to
the
portrait
on
the
panel
,
saying--
 
<EOS>
"
there
,
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
be
your
likeness
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
look
,
and
,
<EOS>
have
walk
up
to
it
,

an
under
tone
,
rather
as
if
he
be
converse
with
himself
than
make
a
remark
for
any
one
else
to
hear
,
he
said--
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
wonderfully
like

It
be
,
indeed
,
"
say
Charles

"
if
I
stand
beside
it

thus
,
"

place
himself
in

favourable
attitude

compare
the

<EOS>
,
"
I
dare
say
you
will
be
more
strike
with
the
likeness
than
before

"
 
<EOS>
so
accurate
be
it
now
,
that
the
same
light
fall
upon
his
face
as
that
under
which
the
painter
have
execute
the
portrait

that
all
start
back
a
step
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
"
some
artist
,
"
remark
Varney
,
"
have
the
sense
to
ask
where
a
portrait
be
to
be
hang
before
they
paint
it
,
and
then
they
adapt
their
light
and
shadow
to
those
which
would
fall
upon
the
original
,
be
it
similarly
situate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
stand
this
,

say
Charles
to
Henry
;
"
I
must
question
him
farther
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
as
you
please
,
but
do
not
insult
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
beneath
my
roof
now
,
and
,
after
all
,
it
be
but
<EOS>
a
hideous
suspicion
we
have
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
rely
upon
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
Charles
step
forward
,
and
once
again
confront
Varney
,
with
an
earnest
gaze
,
he
said--
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
,
sir
,
that
Miss
Bannerworth
declare
the
vampyre
<EOS>
she
fancy
to
have
visit
this
chamber
to
be
,
in
feature
,
the
exact
counterpart
of
this
portrait
?

<EOS>
"
do
she
indeed
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
do
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
perhaps
,
then
,
that
account
for
her
thinking
that
I
be
the
vampyre
,
because
I
bear
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
portrait
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
be
surprised
,
"
say
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
very
odd
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
yet
entertaining
.
<EOS>
I
be
rather
amuse
than
otherwise
.
<EOS>
the
idea
of
be
a
vampyre
.
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
if
ever
I
go
to
a
masquerade
again
,
I
shall
certainly
assume
the
character
of
a
vampyre

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
do
it
well
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
,
now
,
I
should
make
quite
a
sensation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
certain
you
would
.
<EOS>
do
you
not
think
,
gentleman
,
that
Sir
Francis
Varney
would
enact
the
character
to
the
very
life

<EOS>
by
Heavens
,
he
would
do
it
so
well
that
one
may
,
without
much
difficulty
,
really
imagine
him
a

"
 
<EOS>
"
Bravo
--
bravo
,
"
say
Varney
,
as
he
gently
fold
his
hand
together
,
with
that
genteel
applause
that
may
even
be
indulge
in
in
a
box
at
the
opera
itself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Bravo
.
<EOS>
I
like
to
see
young
person
enthusiastic
;
it
look
as
if
they
have
some
of
the
real
fire
of
genius
in
their
composition
.
<EOS>
Bravo
--
bravo

"
 
<EOS>
this
be
,
Charles
think
,
the
very
height
and
acme
of
impudence
,
and
yet
what
could
he
do
?
<EOS>
what
could
he
say
?
<EOS>
He
be
foil
by
the
downright
coolness
of
Varney
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
Henry
,
George
,
and
Mr.
Marchdale
,
they
have
listen
to
what
be
pass
between
Sir
Francis
and
Charles
in
silence
.
<EOS>
They
fear
to
diminish
the
effect
of
anything
Charles
may
say
,
by
add
a
word
of
their
own
;
and
,
likewise
,
they
do
not
wish
to
lose
one
observation
that
may
come
from
the
lip
of
Varney
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
Charles
appear
to
have
say
all
he
have
to
say
,
he
turn
to
the
window
and
look
out
.
<EOS>
He
seem
like
a
man
who
have
make
up
his
mind
,
for
a
time
,
to
give
up
some
contest
in
which
he
have
be
engage
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
perhaps
,
not
so
much
do
he
give
it
up
from
any
feeling
or
consciousness
of
be
beat
,
as
from
a
conviction
that
it
could
be
the
more
effectually
,
at
some
other
and
far
more
eligible
opportunity
,
renew
.
 
<EOS>
Varney
now
address
Henry
,
saying,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
presume
the
subject
of
our
conference
,
when
you
do
me
the
honour
of
a
call
,
be
no
secret
to
any
one
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
none
whatever
,
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
,
perhaps
,
I
be
too
early
in
ask
you
if
you
have
make
up
your
mind
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
scarcely
,
certainly
,
have
time
to
think
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
sir
,
do
not
let
me
hurry
you
;
<EOS>
I
much
regret
,
indeed
,
the
intrusion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
seem
anxious
to
possess
the
Hall
,

remark
Mr.
Marchdale
,
to
Varney
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
it
new
to
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
quite
.
<EOS>
I
have
some
boyish
recollection
connect
with
this
neighbourhood
,
among
which
Bannerworth
Hall
stand
sufficiently
prominent
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
how
long
ago
that
be
?
"
say
Charles
Howard
,
rather
abruptly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
recollect
,
my
enthusiastic
young
friend
,
"
say
Varney
.
<EOS>
"
how
old
be
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
just
about
twenty
-
one
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
,
then
,
for
your
age
,
quite
a
model
of
discretion
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
difficult
for
the
most
accurate
observer
of
human
nature
to
have
decide
whether
this
be
say
truthfully
or
ironically
,
so
Charles
make
no
reply
to
it
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
trust
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
we
shall
induce
you
,
as
this
be
your
first
visit
,
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
to
the
Hall
,
to
partake
of
some
thing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
a
cup
of
wine--
"
 
"
be
at
your
service
.
"
 
<EOS>
Henry
now
lead
the
way
to
a
small
parlour
,
which
,
although
by
no
mean
one
of
the
showy
room
of
the
house
,
be
,
from
the
care
and
exquisite
carving
with
which
it
abound
,
much
more
to
the
taste
of
any
who
possess
an
accurate
judgment
in
such
work
of
art

<EOS>
then
wine
be
order
,
and
Charles
take
an
opportunity
of
whisper
to
<EOS>
henry,--
 
<EOS>
"
notice
<EOS>
well

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
do

<EOS>

You

nothing

leave

the

terrified

of
announce
her
intention

<EOS>
to
be
sure

she
send
a
boy
for
her
money
afterwards

which
may
be
consider
a
great
act
of
condescension

suspecting

then
,
this
state
of
thing
,
George

hasten
to
the
gate
,

,
be
not
over
well
pleased
at
the
continuous
and
unnecessary

up
at

open
it
quickly

cry
,
with
more
impatience
,
by
a
vast
amount

than
be
usual
with
him

impatient

ejaculate
George

he
would
have
close
the
gate
upon
them
;
but
Jack
introduce
between
it
and
the
post
the
end
of
a
thick
stick

saying,--

Avast
there

suddenly
cry
Jack

distance
off

appear
to

angrily
converse

George
glance
in

there
he
see
Sir
Francis

Mr.
Marchdale
stand
within
a
few
pace
of
each
other
,
and
apparently
engage
in
some
angry
discussion

His
first
impulse
be
to
go
immediately
towards
them

,
before
he
could
execute
even
that
suggestion

he

Varney
strike

the
latter
fall
to

George

as
he
endeavour

rather
unwieldy
form

,
before
he
could
accomplish
this

for

be
narrow

swiftness

off

the
spot

<EOS>
who
it
could
have
be
that
so
far
intermeddle
with
his
affair
as
to
write
to
him
,
he
could
not
possibly
conceive
.
 
<EOS>
a
very
few
word
will
suffice
to
explain
the
precise
position
in
which
Charles
Holland
be
.
<EOS>
a
considerable
sum
of
money
have
be
leave
to
him
,
but
it
be
saddle
with
the
condition
that
he
should
not
come
into
possession
of
it
until
he
be
one
year
beyond
the
age
which
be
usually
denominate
that
of
discretion
,
namely
,
twenty
-
one
.
<EOS>
His
uncle
,
the
admiral
,
be
the
trustee
of
his
fortune
,
and
he
,
with
rare
discretion
,
have
get
the
active
and
zealous
assistance
of
a
professional
gentleman
of
great
honour
and
eminence
to
conduct
the
business
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
this
gentleman
have
advise
that
for
the
two
year
between
the
age
of
twenty
and
twenty
-
two
,
Charles
Holland
should
travel
,
inasmuch
as
in
english
society
he
would
find
himself
in
an
awkward
position
,
be
for
one
whole
year
of
age
,
and
yet
wait
for
his
property
.
 
<EOS>
under
such
circumstance
,
reason
the
lawyer
,
a
young
man
,
unless
he
be
possess
of
very
rare
discretion
indeed
,
be
almost
sure
to
get
fearfully
involve
with
money
-
lender
.
<EOS>
be
of
age
,
his
note
,
and
bill
,
and
bond
would
all
be
good
,
and
he
would
be
in
a
ten
time
bad
situation
than
a
wealthy
minor
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
be
duly
explain
to
Charles
,
who
,
rather
eagerly
than
otherwise
,
catch
at
the
idea
of
a
two
year
wander
on
the
continent
,
where
he
could
visit
so
many
place
,
which
to
a
well
read
young
man
like
himself
,
and
one
of
a
lively
imagination
,
be
full
of
the
most
delightful
association
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
acquaintance
with
Flora
Bannerworth
effect
a
great
revolution
in
his
feeling
.
<EOS>
the
dear
,
sweetest
spot
on
earth
become
that
which
she
inhabit
.
<EOS>
when
the
Bannerworths
leave
him
abroad
,
he
know
not
what
to
do
with
himself
.
<EOS>
everything
,
and
every
pursuit
in
which
he
have
before
take
a
delight
,
become
most
distasteful
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
in
fact
,
in
a
short
time
,
completely
"
use
up
,
"
and
then
he
determine
upon
return
to
England
,
and
find
out
the
dear
object
of
his
attachment
at
once
.
<EOS>
this
resolution
be
no
sooner
take
,
than
his
health
and
spirit
return
to
him
,
and
with
what
rapidity
<EOS>
he
could
,
he
now
make
his
way
to
his
native
shore
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
year
be
so
nearly
expire
,
that
he
make
up
his
mind
<EOS>
he
would
not
communicate
either
with
his
uncle
,
the
admiral
,
or
the
professional
gentleman
upon
whose
judgment
he
set
so
high
<EOS>
and
so
just
a
value
.
<EOS>
and
at
the
Hall
he
consider
he
be
in
perfect
security
from
any
interruption
,
and
so
he
would
have
be
,
but
for
that
letter
which
be
write
to
Admiral
Bell
,
and
sign
Josiah
Crinkles
,
but
which
Josiah
Crinkles
so
emphatically
deny
all
knowledge
of
.
<EOS>
who
write
it
,
remain
at
present
one
of
those
mystery
which
time
,
in
the
progress
of
our
narrative
,
will
clear
up
.
 
<EOS>
the
opportune
,
or
rather
<EOS>
the
painful
juncture
at
which
Charles
Holland
have
arrive
at
Bannerworth
Hall
<EOS>
,
we
be
well
cognisant
of
.
<EOS>
where
he
expect
to
find
smile
he
find
tear
,
and
the
family
with
whom
he
have
fondly
hope
he
should
pass
a
time
of
uninterrupted
happiness
,
he
find
plunge
in
the
gloom
incidental
to
an
occurrence
of
the
most
painful
character
.
 
<EOS>
Our
reader
will
perceive
,
too
,
that
come
as
he
do
with
an
utter
disbelief
in
the
vampyre
,
Charles
have
be
compel
,
in
some
measure
,
to
yield
to
the
overwhelming
weight
of
evidence
which
have
be
bring
to
bear
upon
the
subject
,
and
although
he
could
not
exactly
be
say
to
believe
in
the
existence
and
the
appearance
of
the
vampyre
at
Bannerworth
Hall
,
he
be
upon
the
subject
in
a
most
painful
state
of
doubt
and
indecision
.
 
<EOS>
Charles
now
take
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
Henry
privately
,
and
inform
him
exactly
how
he
stand
with
his
uncle
,
adding--
 
<EOS>
"

if
you
forbid
me

and
such
be
the
state
of
nervous
excitement
in
which
she
be
that
even
the
demand
for
admission
make
by
him
to

you
rest
securely

sudden
and
unexpected

in

until
a
few
hour
previous

and
then

pain
and
disease

<EOS>
there

a
splendid
funeral
ceremony
,
which
,
accord
to
the
usage
of
his

take
place
by

<EOS>
so
great
and
rapid

the
ravage
of
disease
,
that
the
count

She

bitterly
.
<EOS>
Her
grief
appear
profound
,
but
she

with
difficulty
,
subdue
it
to
within
decent
bound
,
that
she
may
not
offend
any
of
her
numerous
guest

<EOS>
however
,
they
leave
her
with
the
assurance
of
their
profound
regard
,
and
then
when
they
be
go
,
when
the
last
guest
have
depart
,
and
be
no
longer
visible
to
the
eye
of
the
countess

as
she
gaze
from
the
battlement
,
then
her
behaviour
change
totally
.
 
<EOS>
She
descend
from
the
battlement
,
and
then
with
an
imperious
gesture
she
give
her
order
that
all
the
gate
of
the
castle
should
be
close
,
and
a
watch

then
she
retire
to
her

where
she
remain
unseen

<EOS>
here
the
countess
remain
in
profound
meditation
for
nearly
two
day
,
during
which
time
the
attendant
believe
she
be
pray
for
the
welfare
of
the
soul
of
their
deceased
master
,
and
they
fear
she
would
starve
herself
to
death
if
she
remain
any
longer
.
 
<EOS>
just
as
they
have
assemble
together
for
the
purpose
of
either
recall
her
from
her
vigil
or
break
open
the
door
,
they
be
amazed
to
see
the
countess
open
the
room

door
,
and
stand
in
the

of
them
.
 
<EOS>
"

in

<EOS>
the
servant
be
amazed

terrified
at
her
contract
brow
,
and
forget
to
answer
the
question
she
put
to

"

<EOS>
"
and
why

"

"
because
we

these
two

we

excessive
that
we

"
 
<EOS>
the
countess
's
brow
contract
for
a
few
second
,
and
she
be
about
to
make
a
hasty
reply
,
but
she
conquer
the
desire
to
do
so
,
and
merely
said,--

repair
to

station
,
but
with
such
a
degree
of
alacrity
,
that
they
sufficiently
show
how
much
they
fear
their
mistress
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
count
,
who
be
only
in
his
sixth
year
,
know
little
about
the
loss
he
have

but
after
a
day
or
two
's
grief
,
there
be
an
end
of
his
sorrow
for
the
time

that
night
there

the
message

at
a
signal
the

leave
the

the
stranger
alone

<EOS>
It
be
some
moment
ere
they
speak
,

then
the

say
in
a
low
tone,--

I

countenance
him
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
for
a
time
.
<EOS>
listen
--
we
want
man
in
the
mine
;
my
late
husband
send
very
few
to
them
of
late
year
,
and
therefore
they
be
get
short
of
man
there
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
aye
,
aye
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
thing
will
be
for
you
to
feign
ignorance
of
the
man
,
and
then
you
will
be
able
to
get
him
seize
,
and
place
in
the
mine
,
for
such
man
as
he
be
dangerous
,
and
carry
poison
weapon
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Would
he
not
be
well
out
of
the
world
at
once
;
there
would
be
no
escape
,
and
no
future
contingency
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
--
no
.
<EOS>
I
will
have
no
more
life
take
;
and
he
will
be
make
useful
;
and
,
moreover
,
he
will
have
time
to
reflect
upon
the
mistake
he
have
make
in
threaten
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
pay
for
the
job
,
and
he
have
no
future
claim
.
<EOS>
but
what
about
the
child
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
he
may
remain
for
some
time
longer
here
with
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
dangerous
to
do
so
,
"
say
the
count
;
"
he
be
now
ten
year
old
,
and
there
be
no
know
what
may
be
do
for
him
by
his
relative
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
dare
not
enter
the
gate
of
this
castle
Morven
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
well
;
but
you
know
he
may
have
travel
the
same
road
as
his
father
,
and
all
would
be
settle
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
more
life
,
as
I
tell
you
;
but
we
can
easily
secure
him
some
other
way
,
and
we
shall
be
equally
as
free
from
him
and
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
enough
--
there
be
dungeon
,
I
know
,
in
this
castle
,
and
he
can
be
keep
there
safe
enough
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
can
;
but
that
be
not
what
I
propose
.
<EOS>
We
can
put
him
into
the
mine
and
confine
him
as
a
lunatic
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
excellent
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
we
must
make
those
mine
more
productive
somehow
or
other
;
they
would
be
so
,
but
the
count
would
not
hear
of
it
;
he
say
it
be
so
inhuman
<EOS>
,
they
be
so
destructive
of
life
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
paha
!
<EOS>
what
be
the
mine
intend
for
if
not
for
use
?
"

"
exactly
--
I
often
say
so
,

he
always
put
a
negative
to
it

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
will
make
use
of
an
affirmative
,
my
dear
countess

and
see
what
will
be
the
result
in
a
change
of
policy

<EOS>
by
the
way

our

be
celebrate

not

long

I
be
impatient

You
must
restrain
your
impatience

we
must
have
the
boy
settle
first

the
count
will
have
be
dead
a
long
time
then
,

we
shall
not
give
so
much
scandal
to
the
weak

minded
fool

happen
about

You
shall
act
as
you

the
first
thing
to
be

be

to
get
this
cunne
doctor
quietly
out
of
the
way

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
contrive

have
him
seize
,

carry
to

mine

beneath
the

if

why
,
they
will
scourge
him
in

manner

a
repetition

treatment

that
will
do

himself

tiger

some

pass
over

the
Count

contrive
to

acquainted
with
the
doctor

<EOS>
They
appear
to

stranger

the

have

sit
at

oh

now
get
to

stand
the
first
door

with
some
difficulty
,
they
open

"
It

one

so
say
,
the

open
the

step
on
one
side

approach

the
castle
gate
be
throw
open

everybody
who
come
be
entertain
without
question
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
on
the
occasion
of
the
count
's
and
countess
's
marriage
.
<EOS>
It
seem
many
month
after
the
death
of
her
son
,
whom
she
affect
to
mourn
for
a
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
the
marriage
take
place
,
and
in
all
magnificence
and
splendour
.
<EOS>
the
countess
again
appear
array
in
splendour
and
beauty
:
she
be
proud
and
haughty
,
and
the
count
be
imperious
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
the
young
Count
de
Hugo
de
Verole
be
confine
in
the
mine
,
and
the
doctor
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
by
a
strange
coincidence
,
the
doctor
and
the
young
count
become
companion
,
and
the
former
,
meditate
project
of
revenge
,
educate
the
young
count
as
well
as
he
be
able
for
several
year
in
the
mine
,
and
cherish
in
the
young
man
a
spirit
of
revenge
.
<EOS>
They
finally
escape
together
,
and
proceed
to
Leyden
,
where
the
doctor
have
friend
,
and
where
he
place
his
pupil
at
the
university
,
and
thus
make
him
a
most
efficient
mean
of
revenge
,
because
the
education
of
the
count
give
him
a
means
of
appreciate
the
splendour
and
rank
he
have
be
deprive
of
.
<EOS>
He
,
therefore
,
determine
to
remain
at

then

to
his
father
's
friend
,
and
then
to
his
sovereign
,
to
dispossess
and
punish
them
both
for
their
double
crime
.
 
<EOS>
the
count
and
countess
live
on
in
a
state
of
regal
splendour
.
<EOS>
the
immense
revenue
of
his
territory
,
and
the
treasure
the
late
count
have
amass
,
as
well
as
the
revenue
that
the
mine
bring
in
,
would
have
support
a
much
large
expenditure
than
even
their
taste
dispose
them
to
enjoy
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
hear
nothing
of
the
escape
of
the
doctor
and
the
young
count
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
those
who
know
of
it
hold
their
peace
and
say
nothing
about
it
,
for
they
fear
the
consequence
of
their
negligence
.
<EOS>
the
first
intimation
they
receive
be
at
the
hand
of
a
state
messenger
,
summon
them
to
deliver
up
the
castle
revenue
and
treasure
of
the
late
count
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
astounding
to
them
,
and
they
refuse
to
do
so
,
but
be
soon
after
seize
upon
by
a
regiment
of
cuirassier
send
to
take
them
,
and
they
be
accuse
of
the
crime
of
murder
at
the
instance
of
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
arraign
and
find
guilty
,
and
,
as
they
be
of
the
patrician
order
,
their
execution
be
delay
,
and
they
be
commit
to
exile
.
<EOS>
this
be
do
out
of
favour
to
the
young
count
,
who
do
not
wish
to
have
his
family
name
taint
by
a
public
execution
,
or
their
be
confine
like
convict
.
 
<EOS>
the
count
and
countess
quit
Hungary
,
and
settle
in
Italy
,
where
they
live
upon
the
remain
of
the
Count
of
Morven

property
,
shorn
of
all
their
splendour
but
enough
to
keep
them
from
be
compel

do
any
menial
office

<EOS>
the
young
count
take
possession
of
his
patrimony
and
his
treasure
at
last
,
such
as
be
leave
by
his
mother
and
her
paramour
.
 
<EOS>
the
doctor
continue
to
hide
his
crime
from
the
young
count
,
and
the
perpetrator
deny
all
knowledge
of
it
,
he
escape
;
but
he
return
to
his
native

Leyden
,
with

[

the
footstep
which
Flora

upon
the
close
of
the
tale
she
have
be
read
,
hear
approach
her
apartment
,
come
rapidly
along
the

<EOS>
"
It

Henry

me
to
an
interview
with
Charles

uncle
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
,
now
,
what
manner
of
man
he
be
.
<EOS>
He
should
in
some
respect
resemble
Charles
;
and
if
he
do
so
,
I
shall
bestow
upon
him
some
affection
for
that
alone
.
"
 
<EOS>
Tap
--
<EOS>
tap
come
upon
the
chamber
door
.
<EOS>
Flora
be
not
at
all
alarm
now
,
as
she
have
be
when
Henry
bring
her
the
manuscript
.
<EOS>
from
some
strange
action
of
the
nervous
system
,
she
feel
quite
confident
,
and
resolve
to
brave
everything
.
<EOS>
but
then
she
feel
quite
sure
that
it
be
Henry
,
and
before
the
knocking
have
take
her
by
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
in
,
"
she
say
,
in
a
cheerful
voice
.
"
<EOS>
come
in
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
door
open
with
wonderful
swiftness
--
a
figure
step
into
the
room
,
and
then
close
it
as
rapidly
,
and
stand
against
it
.
<EOS>
Flora
try
to
scream
,
but
her
tongue
refuse
its
office
;
a
confused
whirl
of
sensation
pass
through
her
brain
--
she
tremble
,
and
an
icy
coldness
come
over
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
the
vampyre
!
 
<EOS>
He
have
draw
up
his
tall
,
gaunt
frame
to
its
full
height
,
and
cross
his
arm
upon
his
breast
;
there
be
a
hideous
smile
upon
his
sallow
countenance
,
and
his
voice
be
deep
and
sepulchral
,
as
he
said,--
 
"
Flora
Bannerworth
,
hear
that
which
I
have
to
say
,
and
hear
it
calmly
.
<EOS>
You
need
have
nothing
to
fear
.
<EOS>
make
an
alarm
--
scream
,
or
shout
for
help
,
and
,
by
the
hell
beneath
us
,
you
be
lose
!
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
death
-
like
,
cold
,
passionless
manner
about
the
utterance
of
these
word
,
as
if
they
be
speak
mechanically
,
and
come
from
no
human
lip
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
hear
them
,
and
yet
scarcely
comprehend
them
;
she
step
slowly
back
till
she
reach
a
chair
,
and
there
she
hold
for
support
.
<EOS>
the
only
part
of
the
address
of
Varney
that
thoroughly
reach
her
ear
,
be
that
if
she
give
any
alarm
some
dreadful
consequence
be
to
ensue
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
on
account
of
these
word
that
she
really
give
no
alarm
;
it
be
because
she
be
utterly
unable
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
"
answer
me
,
"
say
Varney
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
promise
that
you
will
hear
that
which
I
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
in
so
promise
you
commit
yourself
to
no
evil
,
and
you
shall
hear
that
which
shall
give
you
much
peace
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
she
try
to
speak
;
her
lip
move
,
but
she
utter
no
sound
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
terrified
,
"
say
Varney
,
"
<EOS>
and
yet
I
know
not
why
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
come
to
do
you
harm
,
although
harm
have
you
do
me
.
<EOS>
girl
,
I
come
to
rescue
you
from
a
thraldom
of
the
soul
under
which
you
now
labour
.
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
pause
of
some
moment
'
duration
,
and
then
,
faintly
,
Flora
manage
to
say,--
 
"
help
!
<EOS>
help
!
<EOS>
oh
,
help
me
,
Heaven
!
"
 
<EOS>
Varney
make
a
gesture
of
impatience
,
as
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
work
no
special
matter
now
.
<EOS>
Flora
Bannerworth
,
if
you
have
as
much
intellect
as
your
nobility
and
beauty
would
warrant
the
world
in
supposing
,
you
will
listen
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
--
I
hear
,
"
say
Flora
,
as
she
still
,
drag
the
chair
with
her
,
increase
the
distance
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
<EOS>
well
.
<EOS>
You
be
now
more
composed
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
fix
her
eye
upon
the
face
of
Varney
with
a
shudder
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
mistake
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
same
which
,
with
the
strange
,
glassy
look
eye
,
have
glare
upon
her
on
that
awful
night
of
the
storm
when
she
be
visit
by
the
vampyre
.
<EOS>
and
Varney
return
that
gaze
<EOS>
unflinchingly
there
be
a
hideous
and
strange
contortion
of
his
face
now
as
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
beautiful
.
<EOS>
the
most
cunning
statuary
may
well
model
some
rare
work
of
art
from
those
round
limb
,
that
be
surely
make
to
bewitch
the
gazer

<EOS>
Your
skin
rival
the
driven
snow

what
a
face
of
loveliness
,
and
what
a
form
of
enchantment

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
speak
,
but
a
thought
come
across
her
mind
,
which
at
once
crimson
her
cheek
--
she
know
she
have
faint
on
the
first
visit
of
the
vampyre
,
and
now
he
,
with
a
hideous
reverence
,
praise
beauty
which
he
may
have
cast
his
demoniac
eye
over
at
such
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
understand
me

.
<EOS>
"
well

that
pass

deep
in

a
world
of
passion

one

never

love
you

this
sort

humour

in
which
be
the
old
admiral

would
soon
pass
away

and
then
that
he
would
listen
to
him
comfortably
enough
;
so
he
would
not
allow
the

exhibition
of
petulance

impatience

all
I

that
it
be
suppose
a

come
one
night
and
inflict
a
wound
upon
Flora
's
neck
with
his
tooth
,
and
that
he
be
still
endeavour
to
renew
his
horrible
existence
from
the
young

pure
blood
that
flow
through
her
vein

the
devil
he
be
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
I
be
bewilder
,
I
must
confess
,
by
the
mass
of
circumstance
that
have
combine
to
give
the
affair
a
horrible
truthfulness
.
<EOS>
poor
Flora
be
much
injure
in
health
and
spirit
;
and
when
I
come
home
,
she
,
at
once
,
implore
me
to
give
her
up
,
and
think
of
her
no
more
,
for
she
could
not
think
of
allow
me
to
unite
my
fate
with
her
,
under
such
circumstance

She
do
?

such
be
her
word

She
implore
me
<EOS>

she
use
that
word
,
'
implore'--to
fly
from
her
,
to
leave
her
to
her
fate
,
to
endeavour
to
find
happiness
with
some
one
else
.

<EOS>
"
well

I
see
her
heart
be
break

what

that

much
of

tell
her
that

I
tell
her

me

that
with
what
power

strength
God
have
give
me

stand

her

all
ill

what
then

She

Could
I
desert

could
I

the
old
admiral

in
a
voice

give
his
lip
a
vigorous
wipe
with
his
sleeve

and
Charles
say
hastily,--
 
<EOS>
"
My

you
will
recollect

I
suppose
she
be

do
you

kiss
a

"
no

you
know
young

very
delicate

you
approve

I
have
do

You
be
a
young
scamp
,

you
have
get
some
of
the

family
blood

you

so
do
not

any
credit
for
act

you

Charles

with
a

what
would
have
become

then

<EOS>
"
what
be
that
to
you

I
would

that
would
have
be
one
way
of
get
over
the
difficulty

no

all

<EOS>
the
man

desert
the
good
ship

carry
him
through

wave

It

They

Henry

countenance
,
perhaps
,
wear
the
most
determined
expression

all

<EOS>
He
appear
now
as
if
he
have
thoroughly
make
up
his
mind
to
do
something
which
should
have
a

tendency

Mr.

be
more
sad

depressed

to
all
appearance

than

<EOS>
as
for
the
admiral
,
he
be
evidently
in
a
state
of
amazement
,
and
know
not
what
to
think
.
<EOS>
He
be
anxious
to
do
something
,
and
yet
what
that
be
to
be
he
have
not
the
most
remote
idea

any

cognisant
of
any
of

every

so
completely
out

George
have
go
to

CHAPTER
XXII
.
 
<EOS>
the
consultation.--the
determination
to
leave
the
HALL
.
  
<EOS>
[
illustration
]
 
<EOS>
this
be
certainly
the
most
seriously
reasonable
meeting
which
have
be
hold
at
Bannerworth
Hall
on
the
subject
of
the
much
dreaded
vampyre
.
<EOS>
the
absolute
necessity
for
do
something
of
a
decisive
character
be
abundantly
apparent
,
and
when
Henry
promise
Flora
that
her
earnest
wish
to
leave
the
house
should
not
be
forget
as
an
element
in
the
discussion
which
be
about
to
ensue
,
it
be
with
a
rapidly
grow
feeling
on
his
own
part
,
to
the
effect
that
that
house
,
associate
even
as
it
be
with
many
endearing
recollection
,
be
no
home
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
hence
he
be
the
more
inclined
to
propose
a
departure
from
the
Hall
if
it
could
possibly
be
arrange
satisfactorily
in
a
pecuniary
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
the
pecuniary
point
of
view
,
however
,
in
which
Henry
be
compel
to
look
at
the
subject
,
be
an
important
and
a
troublesome
one
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
already
hint
at
the
very
peculiar
state
of
the
finance
of
the
family
;
and
,
in
fact
,
although
the
income
derivable
from
various
source
ought
to
have
be
amply
sufficient
to
provide
Henry
,
and
those
who
be
dependent
upon
him
,
with
a
respectable
livelihood
,
yet
it
be
nearly
all
swallow
up
by
the
payment
of
regular
instalment
upon
family
debt
incur
by
his
father
.
<EOS>
and
the
creditor
take
great
credit
to
themselves
that
they
allow
of
such
an
arrangement
,
instead
of
sweep
off
all
before
them
,
and
leave
the
family
to
starve
.
 
<EOS>
the
question
,
therefore
,
or
,
at
all
event
,
one
of
the
question
,
now
be
,
how
far
would
a
departure
from
the
Hall
of
him
,
Henry
,
and
the
other
branch
of
the
family
,
act
upon
that
arrangement
?
 
<EOS>
during
a
very
few
minute
'
consideration
,
Henry
,
with
the
frank
and
candid
disposition
which

to
Charles

when
once
he

such

determination
he

no

"

"

Mr.

,
when
he
have
do
,
"
I
can
not
see
what
right
your

your

<EOS>
"
true
;

they
always

me

to
remain
at

if
they
choose

why
,
of

at

they

off

I

add
Mr.

that

It

Charles

more

that

no

the
being
pester
by
such
a

Sir

It
make
one
impatient

angry
to
reflect
upon
such
a

yet
they
be
lamentably
true

Henry

what
can
we
do

surely
there
must

there

out
of

my

at

step

we

you

We

so

well

I

I
have
hear
all

this
do
beat

It

monstrous
,
"
exclaim
Charles

<EOS>
there
be
a
pause
of
some

moment

then
Mr.

say
,
in
a
low
voice,--
 
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
ought
not
to
propose
any
course
of
action
until
you
,
Henry

have
yourself
do
so
;

even
at
the
risk
of
be
presumptuous
,
I
will
say
that
I
be
firmly
of
opinion
<EOS>
you
ought
to
leave

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
inclined
to

so

too

Henry

the
creditor

"
interpose
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
they
may
be
consult
on
the
matter
beforehand
,
"
add
Marchdale
,
"
when
no
doubt
they
would
acquiesce
in
an
arrangement

could
do
them
no
harm

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
no
harm

Henry

for
I
can
not

the
estate

they

precisely
.

if

you

to

why
,
under
the

it

"
Sir

"
<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
It
seem
to
be

object
with
him
to

it
appear
to
me
,
that

all
that

it

most
decidedly
the
good
policy
to

<EOS>
nobody
could
really
deny
the

of
this
advice

it
seem
strange

be
repugnant

they

it

<EOS>
there
be
a
pause
of
some
second

then
Henry
said,--

indeed

Charles

after

Will

suddenly

have
you
any
plan

my

Mr.

I
have

it

<EOS>
"
I
have
no

I
do

I

You
induce
in
my

a
suspicion

by

you

Charles
be
silent

Henry
then
added,--

"
now
,
Charles

I
be
quite
convinced

what
I

the
fact

conceive
some
scheme

I

not

that
I
have
,

It
be
one
,
however

which
you
must
allow
me
for
the

to
keep
lock
in

"
 
<EOS>
"
why
will
you
not
trust

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

for
two
reason

"
 
<EOS>

indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
one
be
,
that
I

not

upon

the
other
be
,
that
it

one
in

I

else

<EOS>

Charles

Charles

Henry

despondingly

only
consider
for

under

you

I

in

ask

be
incautiously
load

,
he
can
be
a
very
gentlemanly
man
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
he
can
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
manner
be
easy
and
polished
;
he
have
evidently
mix
in
good
society
,
and
I
never
,
in
all
my
life
,
hear
such
a
sweet
,
soft
,
win
voice
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
strictly
him
.
<EOS>
You
notice
,
I
presume
,
his
great
likeness
to
the
portrait
on
the
panel
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
at
some
moment
,
and
view
his
face
in
some
particular
light
,
it
show
much
more
strongly
than
at
other
.
<EOS>
My
impression
be
that
he
could
,
when
he
like
,
look
much
more
like
the
portrait
on
the
panel
than
when
he
allow
his
face
to
assume
its
ordinary
appearance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
probably
such
an
impression
would
be
produce
upon
your
mind
,
"
say
Charles
,
"
by
some
accidental
expression
of
the
countenance
which
even
he
be
not
aware
of
,
and
which
often
occur
in
family
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
do
not
hint
,
sir
,
at
what
have
pass
here
with
regard
to
him
?
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
be
,
you
see
,
call
in
professionally
,
I
have
no
right
to
take
advantage
of
that
circumstance
to
make
any
remark
to
him
about
his
private
affair
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
certainly
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
one
to
me
whether
he
be
a
vampyre
or
not
,
professionally
,
and
however
deeply
I
may
feel
,
personally
,
interested
in
the
matter
,
I
say
nothing
to
him
about
it
,
because
,
you
see
,
if
I
have
,
he
would
have
have
a
fair
opportunity
of
say
at
once
,
'
pray
,
sir
,
what
be
that
to
you
?
'
<EOS>
and
I
should
have
be
at
a
loss
what
to
reply
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Can
we
doubt
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
but
that
this
very
wound
have
be
inflict
upon
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
by
the
pistol
-
bullet
which
be
discharge
at
him
by
Flora
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
everything
lead
to
such
an
assumption
certainly
,
"
say
Charles
Holland
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
yet
you
can
not
even
deduce
from
that
the
absolute
fact
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
be
a
vampyre
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
,
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
"
say
Marchdale
,
"
anything
would
convince
you
but
a
visit
from
him
,
and
an
actual
attempt
to
fasten
upon
some
of
your
own
vein
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
would
not
convince
me
,
"
say
Chillingworth
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
will
not
be
convince
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
will
not
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
hold
out
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
I
say
at
the
first
,
and
I
say
so
still
,
that
I
never
will
give
way
to
this
most
outrageous
superstition
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
think
with
you
,
"
say
Marchdale
,
with
a
shudder
;
"
but
there
may
be
something
in
the
very
atmosphere
of
this
house
which
have
be
render
hideous
by
the
awful
visit
that
have
be
make
to
it
,
which
forbid
me
to
disbelieve
in
those
thing
which
other
more
happily
situate
can
hold
at
arm
's
length
,
and
utterly
repudiate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
may
be
,
"
say
Henry
;
"
but
<EOS>
as
to
that
,
I
think
,
after
the
very
strongly
express
wish
of
Flora
,
I
will
decide
upon
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
sell
it
or
let
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
latter
I
should
much
prefer
,
"
be
the
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
who
will
take
it
now
,
except
Sir
Francis
Varney
?
<EOS>
why
not
at
once
let
him
have
it
?
<EOS>
I
be
well
aware
that
this
do
sound
odd
advice
,
but
remember
,
we
be
all
the
creature
of
circumstance
,
and
that
,
in
some
case
where
we
least
like
it
,
we
must
swim
with
the
stream
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
you
will
not
decide
upon
,
however
,
at
present
,
"
say
Charles
Holland
,
as
he
rise
.
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
not
;
a
few
day
can
make
no
difference
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
none
for
the
bad
,
certainly
,
and
possibly
much
for
the
well
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
it
so
;
we
will
wait
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Uncle
,
"
say
Charles
,
"
will
you
spare
me
half
an
hour
of
your
company
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
an
hour
,
my
boy
,
if
you
want
it
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
rise
from
his
chair
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
this
consultation
be
over
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
and
we
quite
understand
that
to
leave
the
Hall
be
a
matter
determine
on
,
and
that
in
a
few
day
a
decision
shall
be
come
to

to
whether
Varney

Vampyre

its
tenant

CHAPTER
XXIII
.
 
<EOS>
the
admiral
's
advice
to
CHARLES
holland.--the
challenge
to
the
VAMPYRE
.
  
<EOS>
[
illustration
]
 
when
Charles
Holland
get
his
uncle
into
a
room
by
themselves
,
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
Uncle
,
you
be
a
seaman
,
and
accustom
to
decide
upon
matter
of
honour
.
<EOS>
I
look
upon
myself
as
have
be
most
grievously
insult
by
this
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
<EOS>
all
account
agree
in
represent
him
as
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
He
go
openly
by
a
title
,
which
,
if
it
be
not
his
,
could
easily
be
contradict
;
therefore
,
on
the
score
of
position
in
life
,
there
be
no
fault
to
find
with
him
.
<EOS>
what
would
you
do
if
you
be
insult
by
a
gentleman
?
"
 
<EOS>
the
old
admiral
's
eye
sparkle
,
and
he
look
comically
in
the
face
of
Charles
,
as
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
now
where
you
be
steer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
would
you
do
,
uncle
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
fight
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
would
say
so
,
and
that
be
just
what
I
want
to
do
as
regard
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
boy
,
I
do
not
know
that
you
can
do
better
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
a
thundering
rascal
,
whether
he
be
a
vampyre
or
not
;
so
if
you
feel
that
he
have
insult
you
,
fight
him
by
all
mean
,
Charles
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
much
pleased
,
uncle
,
to
find
that
you
take
my
view
of
the
subject
,
"
say
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
if
I
mention
such
a
thing
to
the
Bannerworths
,
they
would
endeavour
all
in
their
power
to
pursuade
me
against
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
no
doubt
;
because
they
be
all
impressed
with
a
strange
fear
of
this
fellow
's
vampyre
power
.
<EOS>
besides
,
if
a
man
be
go
to
fight
,
the
few
people
he
mention
it
to
most
decidedly
the
well
,
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
that
be
the
fact
,
uncle
.
<EOS>
Should
I
overcome
Varney
<EOS>
,
there
will
most
likely
be
at
once
an
end
to
the
numerous
and
uncomfortable
perplexity
of
the
Bannerworths
as
regard
him
;
and
if
he
overcome
me
,
why
,
then
,
at
all
event
,
I
shall
have
make
an
effort
to
rescue
Flora
from
the
dread
of
this
man
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
then
he
shall
fight
me
,
"
add
the
admiral
,
"
<EOS>
so
he
shall
have
two
chance
,
at
all
event
,
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
uncle
,
that
would
,
you
know
,
scarcely
be
fair
.
<EOS>
besides
,
if
I
should
fall
,
I
solemnly
bequeath
Flora
Bannerworth
to
your
good
office
.
<EOS>
I
much
fear
that
the
pecuniary
affair
of
poor
Henry,--from
<EOS>
no
fault
of
his
,
Heaven
knows,--are
in
a
very
bad
state
,
and
that
Flora
may
yet
live
to
want
some
kind
and
able
friend
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
never
fear
,
Charles
.
<EOS>
the
young
creature
shall
never
want
while
the
old
admiral
have
get
a
shot
in
the
locker
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
uncle
,
thank
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
ample
cause
to
know
,
and
to
be
able
to
rely
upon
your
kind
and
generous
nature
.
<EOS>
and
now
about
the
challenge
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
write
it
,
boy
,
and
I
will
take
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
second
me
,
uncle
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
I
will
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
trust
anybody
else
to
do
so
on
any
account
.
<EOS>
You
leave
all
the
arrangement
with
me
,
and
I
will
second
you
as
you
ought
to
be
second
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
write
it
at
once
,
for
I
have
receive
injury
at
the
hand
of
that
man
,
or
devil
,
be
he
what
he
may
,
that
I
can
not
put
up
with
.
<EOS>
His
visit
to
the
chamber
of
her
whom
I
love
would
alone
constitute
ample
ground
of
action
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
it
rather
would
,
my
boy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
after
this
corroborative
story
of
the
wound
,
I
can
not
for
a
moment
doubt
that
Sir
Francis
Varney
be
the
vampyre
,
or
the
personifier
of
the
vampyre
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
clear
enough
,
Charles
.
<EOS>
come
,
<EOS>
just
you
write
your
challenge
,
my
boy
,
at
once
,
and
let
me
have
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
uncle
.
"
 
<EOS>
Charles
be
a
little
astonished
,
although
pleased
,
at
his
uncle
's
ready
acquiescence
in
his
fight
a
vampyre
,
but
that
circumstance
he
ascribe
to
the
old
man
's
habit
of
life
,
which
make
him
so
familiar
with
strife
and
personal
contention
of
all
sort
,
that
he
do
not
ascribe
to
it
that
amount
of
importance
which
more
peaceable
people
do
.
<EOS>
have
he
,
while
he
be
write
the
note
to
Sir
Francis
Varney
<EOS>
,
see
the
old
admiral
's
face
,
and
the
exceedingly
cunning
look
it
wear
,
he
may
have
suspect
that
the
acquiescence
in
the
duel
be
but
a
seeming
acquiescence
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
escape
him
,
and
in
a
few
moment
he
read
to
his
uncle
the
follow
note:--
      
<EOS>
"
to
SIR
FRANCIS
VARNEY
.
      
<EOS>
"
sir,--the
expression
make
use
of
towards
me
by
you
,
as
well
as
     
general
circumstance
,
which
I
need
not
furth
allude
to
here
,
     
induce
me
to
demand
of
you
that
satisfaction
due
from
one
     
gentleman
to
another
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
Admiral
Bell
,
be
the
bearer
of
     
this
note
,
and
will
arrange
preliminary
with
any
friend
you
may
     
choose
to
appoint
to
act
in
your
behalf

CHARLES

Will
that
do

Charles

Capital
!

the
admiral

I
be
glad
you
like
it

oh
,
I
could
not

like
it

the
least
say

the
most
to
the
purpose

always
please
me
best
;
and
this
explain
nothing
,
and
demand
all
you
want
--
which
be
a
fight
;
so
it
be
all
right
,
you
see
,
and
nothing
can
be
possibly
well

"
 
<EOS>
Charles
do
glance
in
his
uncle
's
face
,
for
he
suspect
,
from
the
manner
in
which
these
word
be
utter
,
that
the
old
man
be
amuse
himself
a
little
at
his
expense

<EOS>
the
admiral

however
,
look
so
supernaturally
serious
that
Charles
be
foil

"
I
repeat
,
it
be
a
capital
letter

he
say

yes

so

do
you
doubt
my
word

"
 
<EOS>
"
not
at
all

uncle

only
I
think
there
be
a
degree
of
irony
in
the
manner

you
speak

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
none
at
all

my
boy

I
never
be
more
serious

all

very
good

you
will
remember

admiral
bustle
out
of
the
room
,
and
in
a
few
moment
Charles
hear
him
call
loudly,--

so
perfectly
understand

walk
away

converse
as

their
different

upon

obliterate
all
impression

<EOS>
Charles
pace
to
and
fro
in
the
room
where
he
have
hold
this
brief
and
conclusive
conversation
with
his
uncle
.
<EOS>
He
be
thoughtful
,
as
any
one
may
well
be
who
know
not
but
that
the
next
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
would
be
the
limit
of
his
sojourn
in
this
world
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Flora
--
Flora
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
at
length
say
,
"
how
happy
we
may
to
have
be
together
--
how
happy
we
may
have
be
!
<EOS>
but
all
be
past
now

there
seem
nothing
leave
us

to
endure

<EOS>
there
it
but
one
chance
,

that
be
in
my
kill
this
fearful
man
who
be
invest
with
so
dreadful
an
existence
.
<EOS>
and
if
I
do
kill
him
in
fair
and
in
open
fight
,
I
will
take
care
that
his
mortal
frame
have
no
power
again

revisit
the
glimpse
of

"
 
<EOS>
It
be
strange
to
imagine
that
such
be
the
force
of
many
concurrent
circumstance
,
that
a
young
man
like
Charles
Holland
,
of
first
-
rate
ability
and
education
,
should
find
it
necessary
to
give
in
so
far
to
a
belief
which
be
repugnant
to
all
his
good
feeling
and
habit
of
thought
,
as
to
be
reason
with
himself
upon
the
good
mean
of
prevent
the
resuscitation
of
the
corpse
of
a
vampyre
.
<EOS>
but
so
it
be
.
<EOS>
His
imagination
have
yield
to
a
succession
of
event
which
very
few
person
indeed
could
have
hold
out
against
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
and
read
,
"
he
say
,
as
he
continue
his
agitated
and
uneasy
walk
,
"
of
how
these
dreadful
being
be
to
be
in
their
grave
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
of
stake
be
drive
through
the
body
so
as
to
pin
it
to
the
earth
until
the
gradual
progress
of
decay
have
render
its
revivification
a
thing
of
utter
and
total
impossibility
.
<EOS>
then
,
again
,
"
he
add
,
after
a
slight
pause
,
"
I
have
hear
of
their
be
burn
,
and
the
ashe
gather
to
the
wind
of
Heaven
to
prevent
them
from
ever
again
unite
or
assume
human

<EOS>
these
be
disagreeable
and
strange
fancy
,
and
he
shudder
while
he
indulge
in
them

<EOS>
He
feel
a
kind
of
tremble
horror

over

at
the

by
the

the

ascribe
to

nearly
one
hundred

fifty

of
age
now

<EOS>
this
be
a
supposition
which
carry
the

to
a
vast
amount

strange
conjecture

"
what
change

must
have
witness
about

Charles
.
<EOS>

how

of
custom

have
become
a

his
fearful

fearful

<EOS>
this
be
a
wide
field
of
conjecture
for

fertile
imagination

now
that

be
on
the
eve
of
engage
with
such
a
being
in
mortal
combat
,
on

of
her

love

give
rise
to

more
strongly

thickly
upon
him
than
ever
they
have
do

I

fight

he
suddenly

he
a
hundred
time
more
hideous
a

so

I
will
fight
with

it
may
be
my
fate

rid

<EOS>
Charles
work
himself
up
to
a
kind
of
enthusiasm
by
which
he
almost
succeed
in
convince
himself
that
,
in
attempt
the
destruction
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
he
be
the
champion
of
human
nature

<EOS>
It
would
be
aside
from
the
object
of
these
page

which
be
to
record
fact
as
they
occur
,
to
enter
into
the
metaphysical
course
of
reasoning
which
come
across
Charles
's
mind
;
suffice
it
to
say
that
he
feel
nothing
shake
as
regard
his
resolve
to
meet
Varney
the
Vampyre
,
and
that
he
make
up
his
mind

conflict
should
be
one
of
life

death

<EOS>
"
It

"
It
must

so

either
he

I
must
fall
in
the
fight
which
shall
surely
be

<EOS>
He
now
seek
Flora
,
for
how
soon
may
he
now
be
tear
from
her
for
ever
by
the
irresistible
hand
of
death
.
<EOS>
He
feel
that
,
during
the
few
brief
hour
which
now
would
only
elapse
previous
to
his
meeting
with
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
he
could
not
enjoy
too
much
of
the
society
of
her
who
reign
supreme
in
his
heart
,
and
hold
in
her
own
keep
his
good
affection
.
 
<EOS>
but
while
Charles
be
thus
employ
,
let
us
follow
his
uncle
and
Jack
Pringle
to
the
residence
of
Varney
,
which
,
as
the
reader
be
aware
,
be
so
near
at
hand
that
it
require
not
many
minute
'
sharp
walking
to
reach
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
admiral
know
well
he
could
trust
Jack
with
any
secret
,
for
long
habit
of
discipline
and
deference
to
the
order
of
superior
take
off
the
propensity
to
blabbing
which
,
among
civilian
who
be
not
accustomed
to
discipline
,
be
so
very
prevalent
.
<EOS>
the
old
man
therefore
explain
to
Jack
what
he
mean
to
do
,
and
it
receive
Jack
's
full
approval
;
but
as
in
the
enforced
detail
of
other
matter
it
must
come
out
,
we
will
not
here
prematurely
enter
into
the
admiral
's
plan

<EOS>
when
they
reach
the
residence
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
they
be
receive
courteously
enough
,
and
the
admiral
desire
Jack
to
wait
for
him
in
the
handsome
hall
of
the
house
,
while
he
be
shew
up

to
the
private
room
of
the
vampyre

"
confound
the

"
<EOS>
mutter
the
old
admiral
,
"
he
be
well
lodge
at
all
event

<EOS>
I
should
say
he
be
not
one
of
those
sort
of
vampyre
who
have
nowhere
to
go
to
but
their
own
coffin
when
the
evening
come

the

they

It
be
true
that
the

brightly
outside

although
transiently

still
a

green
tinge

more

it
appear

fall
upon

face

his

sallow
countenance
into
a
still
more
hideous
and
strange
colour

He
be
sit
upon

,
when
the

come
in

he
rise
,

in

deep

toned
voice

extremely
different

Sir

for
the

the

the

you
make
your

Sir
Francis

an
indifferent
affair

well

make
it

not

as
you
like

I
be
old

I
can
pull
a
trigger

well

any
one

<EOS>
"
do
what
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
pull
a
trigger
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
do
not
suppose
I
resort
to
any
such
barbarous
mode
of
fighting
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Barbarous
!
<EOS>
why
,
how
do
you
fight
then
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
as
a
gentleman
,
with
my
sword
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
sword
!
<EOS>
oh
,
nonsense
!
<EOS>
nobody
fight
with
sword
now
-
a
-
day
.
<EOS>
that
be
all
explode
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
cling
to
the
custom
and
the
fashion
of
my
youth
,
"
say
Varney
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
,
year
ago
,
accustom
always
to
wear
a
sword
,
and
to
be
without
one

me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
pray
,
how
many
year
ago
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
old
than
I
look
,
but
that
be
not
the
question
.
<EOS>
I
be
willing
to
meet
you
with
sword
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
You
be
no
doubt
aware
that
,
as
the
challenge
party
,
I
be
entitle
to
the
choice
of
weapon
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
can
not
object
to
my
availing
myself
of
the
one
in
the
use
of
which
I
be
perfectly
unequalle
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
be
,
I
think
,
the
first
swordsman
in
Europe

I
have
have
immense
practice
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
you
have
certainly
make
a
most
unexpected
choice
of
weapon
.
<EOS>
I
can
use
a
sword
still
,
but
be
by
no
mean
a
master
of
fence
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
shall
not
be
say
that
I
go
back
from
my
word
,
and
let
the
chance
be
as
desperate
as
they
may
,
I
will
meet
you

very
good

with

<EOS>
"
ay
,
with
sword
;
but
I
must
have
everything
properly
arrange

so
that
no
blame
can
rest
on
me
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
as
you
will
be
kill
,
you
be
safe
from
all
consequence
,
but
I
shall
be
in

very
different
position

so
,
if
you

I
must
have
this
meeting
get
up
in
such
a
manner

shall
enable
me
to
prove

question
me
on

that

fair
play

the
world

my
good

censorious

you
can
not
stop
people
from

extremely
ill

natured
thing

<EOS>

what
do
you
require

then
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

I
require
you
to
send
me
a
friend
with
a
formal
challenge

well

him

that
all

not

I
will
have
a

on

pink
you

should

a
chance

humane

when
you
pink
me

precisely
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word

you
take
these
affair
easy

I
suppose
you
have
have
a
few
of
them

"
 
<EOS>

oh
,
a
good

<EOS>
People
like
yourself

me
into
them

I
do
not
like
the
trouble
,
I
assure
you
;
it
be
no
amusement
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
,
by
a
great
deal
,
make
some
concession
than
fight
,
because
I
will
fight
with
sword
,
and
the
result
be
then
so
certain
that
there
be
no
danger
in
the
matter
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
hark
you
,
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
<EOS>
You
be
either
a
very
clever
actor
,
or
a
man
,
as
you
say
,
of
such
skill
with
your
sword
,
that
you
can
make
sure
of
the
result
of
a
duel
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
therefore
,
that
it
be
not
fair
play
on
your
part
to
fight
a
duel
with
that
weapon
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
beg
your
pardon
there
.
<EOS>
I
never
challenge
anybody
,

when
foolish
people
will
call
me
out
,
contrary
to
my
inclination

I
think
I

I
can

D
--

n
me
<EOS>
,
there
be
some
reason
in
that

too

say
the
admiral
;

why
do
you
insult
people
?
<EOS>

People
insult
me
first

<EOS>

nonsense

<EOS>

how
should
you

hideous

phenomenon

Admiral
Bell
,
how
should
you
like

I
be
a
harmless
country
gentleman
,

because
,
in
the
heated
imagination
of
some
member
of
a
crack

brain
family
,
some
housebreaker
have
be
convert
into
a
vampyre

pitch
upon

man

accordingly

you
forget
the
proofs

the
portrait

for

what

accidental
likeness
between
me

old
picture

I
to
be
set
down
as
a
vampyre

<EOS>
why
,
when
I
be
in
Austria
last
,
I
see
an
old
portrait
of
a
celebrated
court
fool
,

you
so
strongly
resemble
it

that
I
be
quite
strike
when
I
first
see
you
with

likeness

I
be
not

unpolite

witty
for

old
man
button
up
his
coat
in

passion

fiercely
at

said,--"I

at

intense
bitterness

servant
bow

down

staircase

to
his
great
surprise

instead
of
a
compliment
in
the
shape
of
a
shilling

half

a

crown
for
his
pain

he
receive
a
tremendous
kick

walk
to

[

<EOS>
It
be
Charles
Holland
who
now
advance
hurriedly
to
meet
the
admiral
.
<EOS>
the
young
man
's
manner
be
anxious
.
<EOS>
He
be
evidently
most
intent
upon
know
what
answer
could
be
send
by
Sir
Francis
Varney
to
his
challenge
.
 
<EOS>
"
Uncle
,
"
he
say
,
"
tell
me
at
once
,
will
he
meet
me
?
<EOS>
You
can
talk
of
particular
afterwards
,
but
now
tell
me
at
once
if
he
will
meet
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
as
to
that
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
with
a
great
deal
of
fidgetty
hesitation
,
"
you
see
,
I
can
not
exactly
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
not
say
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
no

He

a
very
odd

there
,

Charles
,
that
Jack
be
of
my
opinion
that
your
opponent
be
an
odd
fish
.

<EOS>
"
but
,
uncle
,
why
trifle
with
my
impatience
thus
?
<EOS>
have
you
see
Sir
Francis
Varney
?

armed

he
load

aside

at
the
spot

be
particularly
allude

<EOS>
this
spot
be
perfectly
well
known

indeed
,
no

could
be
a
single
day
at
Bannerworth
Hall
without
notice
it
,
so
prominent
an
object
be
that
pollard
oak
,
standing
,
as
it
do
,
alone
,
with
the
beautiful
green
sward
all
around
it

near
to
it
be
the
pool
which
hide
be

which
be

in

a

pond

some
little
distance
off

the
thick
plantation

among
the
intricacy
of
which
Sir

the
vampyre
,
have
be
suppose
to
disappear
,
after
the
revivification
of
his
body
at
the
full
of
the
moon
.

this
spot
be
in
view
of
several
of
the
window
of

so
that
if
the
night
should
happen
to
be
a
very
light
one
,
and
any
of
the
inhabitant
of
the
Hall
should
happen
to
have
the
curiosity
to
look
from
those
particular
window
,
no

the
meeting
between
Charles
Holland

the
vampyre
would
be
see

this
,
however
,
be
a
contingency

be
nothing
to

whatever
it
may
be
to
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
and
he
scarcely
at
all
consider
it
as
worth
consideration
.
<EOS>
He
feel
more
happy
and
comfortable
now
that
everything
seem
to
be
definitively
arrange
by
which
he
could
come
to
some
sort
of
explanation

succeed

this
be
a

considerably
raise
Charles

when

seek
Flora
again

he

nothing

the

Charles
then
seek
the
admiral
,
whom
he
find
with
his
hand
behind
him
,
pace
to
and
fro
in
one
of
the
long
walk
of
the
garden
,
evidently
in
a
very
unsettled
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
when
Charles
appear
,
he
quicken
his
pace
,
and
look
in
such
a
state
of
unusual
perplexity
that
it
be
quite
ridiculous
to
observe
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
uncle
,
you
have
make
up
your
mind
thoroughly
by
this
time
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
do
not
know
that

"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
have
have
long
enough
surely
to
think
over
it

I
have
not

you
soon

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
can
not
exactly
say
you
have
,
but
,
somehow
or
another
,
I
do
not
think
very
fast
,
and
I
have
an
unfortunate
propensity
after
a
time
of
come
exactly
round
to
where
I
begin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
uncle

you
can
come
to
no
sort
of
conclusion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
only
one
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
what
may
that
be

"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
that
you
be
right
in
one
thing
,
Charles
,
which
be
,
that
have
send
a
challenge
to
this
fellow
of
a
vampyre
,
you
must
fight
him

<EOS>

I
suspect

that

conclusion

from

<EOS>

why
so

because
it
be
an
obvious
and
a
natural
one

<EOS>
all
your
doubt
,
and
trouble
,
and
perplexity
,
have
be
to
try
and
find
some
excuse
for
not
entertain
that
opinion
,
and
now
that
you
really
find
it
in
vain
to
make
it
<EOS>
,
I
trust
that
you
will
accede
as
you
first
promise
to
do
,

not

by
any
mean

thwart
me

<EOS>
"
I
will
not

you

my
boy

in
my
opinion
you
ought

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

never

that

We
can
not

so
long
as
he
choose
to
deny
be
one

<EOS>
and
after
all
,
if
he
be
really

you
must
admit
that

injured
man

again

some
droll
sight
that
I
have

come
across
my
memory

<EOS>
the
sea
be
the
place
for
wonder

for
mystery

<EOS>
why

we
see
more
in

a

there

than
you
landsman

contrive

make
a
whole

what
be

you
know

Henry

receive

a
very
small
sum
out
of
the
whole
proceed
of

estate
here

ought

hear

I
be

you
lend
me
fifty
pound

arrange

I
wish
to
offer

sum
as
an
accommodation
to
Henry

<EOS>
from
me
,
I
dare
say
he
will
receive
it
freely
,
because
he
must
be
convince
how
freely
it
be
offer
;
and
,
besides
,
they
look
upon
me
now
almost
as
a
member
of
the
family

my
engagement
with
Flora

certainly

when
you
want
any
more
,
come
to
me
for
it

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
could
trespass
thus
far
on
your
kindness
,
uncle

"
trespass
!
<EOS>
It
be
no
trespass
at
all

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
we
will
not
fall
out
about
the
term
in
which
I
can
not
help
express
my
gratitude
to
you
for
many
favour

<EOS>
to

morrow
,
you
will
arrange
the
duel
for
me

"
 
<EOS>
"

as
you

<EOS>
I
do
not

to
that

house
again

"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
we
can
manage
,
I
dare
say
,
by
note
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
good
.
<EOS>
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
put
me
in
mind
altogether
of
a
circumstance
that
happen
a
good
while
ago
,
when
I
be
at
sea
,
and
not
so
old
a
man
as
I
be
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
put
you
in
mind
of
a
circumstance
,
uncle
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
he
be
something
like
a
fellow
that
figure
in
an
affair
that
I
know
a
good
deal
about
;
only
I
do
think
as
my
chap
be
more
mysterious
by
a
d----d
sight
than
this
one
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
dear
,
yes
.
<EOS>
when
anything
happen
in
an
odd
way
at
sea
,
it
be
as
odd
again
as
anything
that
occur
on
land
,
my
boy
,
you
may
depend
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
you
only
fancy
that
,
uncle
,
because
you
have
spend
so
long
a
time
at
sea
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
do
not
imagine
it
,
you
rascal
.
<EOS>
what
can
you
have
on
shore
equal
to
what
we
have
at
sea
?
<EOS>
why
,
the
sight
that
come
before
us
would
make
you
landsmen
's
hair
stand
up
on
end
,
and
never
come
down
again
.

"
 
<EOS>

you
mean

that
you
see
those

,
uncle

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
I
be
once
in
the
southern
ocean
,
in
a
small
frigate
,
look
out
for
a
seventy
-
four
we
be
to
join
company
with
,
when
a
man
at
the
mast
-
head
sing
out
that
he
see
her
on
the
larboard
bow
.
<EOS>
well
,
we
think
it
be
all
right
enough
,
and
make
away
that
quarter
,
when
what
do
you
think
it
turn
out
to
be
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
really
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
head
of
a
fish
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
fish
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
!
a
d----d
deal
big
than
the
hull
of
a
vessel
.
<EOS>
He
be
swim
along
with
his
head
just
what
I
dare
say
he
consider
a
shaving

so
out
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
where
be
the
sail
,
uncle
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
sail
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
your
man
at
the
mast
-
head
must
have
be
a
poor
seaman
not
to
have
miss
the
sail

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

all
,
that

one
of
your

go
idea

now

<EOS>
You
know
nothing

I
will
tell
you
where
the
sail
be

master
Charley

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
should
like
to
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
spray

then
,
that

dash
up
with
a
pair
of
fin
that

close
to

be
in
such
a
quantity

so
white

"

"
oh
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
you
may
say
'
oh
!
'
<EOS>
but
we
all
see
him
--
the
whole
ship
's
crew
;
and
we
sail
alongside
of
him
for
some
time
,
till
he
get
tired
of
us
,
and
suddenly
dive
down
,
make
such
a
vortex
in

water

that
the

shake
again

seem
for
about
a

do
you

never
;
though
other
have
catch
a
glimpse
of
him
now

then
in

ocean

never
come
so
near
him

we
do

have
do
so

It

singular

Singular

not

it
be
a
fool
to
what
I
can
tell
you

why

I
have
see
thing
that

if
I
be

you

up

"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no

;
it
be
quite
impossible

uncle

any
one
could
ever
suspect
you
of
such
a
thing

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
believe
me
,
would
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
would
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
here
go
.
<EOS>
I
will
just
tell
you
now
of
a
circumstance
that
I
have
not

to
mention
to
anybody
yet

<EOS>
"
 
"
indeed
!
<EOS>
why
so
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
because
I
do
not

to
be
continually
fight
people
for
not
believe
it
;
but
here
you
have
it:--
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
We
be
outward
bind
;
a
good
ship
,
a
good
captain
,
and
good
messmate
,
you
know
,
go
far
towards
make
a
prosperous
voyage
a
pleasant
and
happy
one
,
and
on
this
occasion
we
have
every
reasonable
prospect
of
all
.
 
<EOS>
Our
hand
be
all
try
man
--
they
have
be
sailor
from
infancy
;
none
of
your
french
craft
,
that
serve
an
apprenticeship
and
then
become
land
lubber
again
.
<EOS>
oh
,
no
,
they
be
stanch
and
true
,
and
love
the
ocean
as
the
sluggard
love
his
bed
,
or
the
lover
his
mistress
.
 
<EOS>
ay
,
and
for
the
matter
of
that
,
the
love
be
a
more
enduring
and
a
more
healthy
love
,
for
it
increase
with
year
,
and
make
man
love
one
another
,
and
they
would
stand
by
each
other
while
they
have
a
limb
to
lift
--
while
they
be
able
to
chew
a
quid
or
wink
an
eye
,
leave
alone
wag
a
pigtail
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
outward
bind
for
Ceylon
,
with
cargo
,
and
be
to
bring
spice
and
other
matter
home
from
the
indian
market
.
<EOS>
the
ship
be
new
and
good
--
a
pretty
craft
;
she
sit
like
a
duck
upon
the
water
,
and
a
stiff
breeze
carry
her
along
the
surface
of
the
wave
without
your
rocking
,
and
pitching
,
and
tossing
,
like
an
old
wash
-
tub
at
a
mill
-
tail
,
as
I
have
have
the
misfortune
to
sail
in
more
than
once
afore
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
we
be
well
laden
,
and
well
pleased
,
and
weigh
anchor
with
light
heart
and
a
hearty
cheer
.
 
<EOS>
away
we
go
down
the
river
,
and
soon
round
the
North
Foreland
,
and
stand
out
in
the
Channel
.
<EOS>
the
breeze
be
a
steady
and
stiff
one
,
and
carry
us
through
the
water
as
though
it
have
be
make
for
us
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
,
"
say
I
to
a
messmate
of
mine
,
as
he
stand
look
at
the
sky
,
then
at
the
sail
,
and
finally
at
the
water
,
with
a
graver
air
than
I
think
be
at
all
consistent
with
the
occasion
or
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
he
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
ail
you
?
<EOS>
You
seem
as
melancholy
as
if
we
be
about
to
cast
lot
who
should
be
eat
first
.
<EOS>
be
you
well
enough
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
hearty
enough
,
thank
Heaven
,
"
he
say
,
"
but
I
do
not
like
this
breeze
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
like
the
breeze
!
"
say
I
;
"
why
,
mate
,
it
be
as
good
and
kind
a
breeze
as
ever
fill
a
sail
.
<EOS>
what
would
you
have
,
a
gale
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
<EOS>
;
I
fear
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
with
such
a
ship
,
and
such
a
set
of
hearty
able
seaman
,
I
think
we
could
manage
to
weather
out
the
stiff
gale
that
ever
whistle
through
a
yard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
may
be
;
I
hope
it
be
,
and
I
really
believe
and
think
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
what
make
you
so
infernally
mopish
and
melancholy
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
but
can
not
help
it
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
as
though
there
be
something
hang
over
us
,
and
I
can
not
tell
what
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
there
be
the
colour
,
Jack
,
at
the
masthead
;
they
be
fly
over
us
with
a
hearty
breeze
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
ah
!
"
say
Jack
,
look
up
at
the
colour
,
and
then
go
away
without
say
anything
more
,
for
he
have
some
piece
of
duty
to
perform
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
my
messmate
have
something
on
his
mind
that
cause
him
to
feel
sad
and
uncomfortable
,
and
I
take
no
more
notice
of
it
;
indeed
,
in
the
course
of
a
day
or
two
he
be
as
merry
as
any
of
the
rest
,
and
have
no
more
melancholy
that
I
could
perceive
,
but
be
as
comfortable
as
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
a
gale
off
the
coast
of
Biscay
,
and
ride
it
out
without
the
loss
of
a
spar
or
a
yard
;
indeed
,
without
the
slight
accident
or
rent
of
any
kind
.
 
<EOS>
"
now
,
Jack
,
what
do
you
think
of
our
vessel
?
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
like
a
duck
upon
water
,
rise
and
fall
with
the
wave
,
and
do
not
tumble
up
and
down
like
a
hoop
over
stone
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
<EOS>
;
she
go
smoothly
and
sweetly
;
she
be
a
gallant
craft
,
and
this
be
her
first
voyage
,
and
I
predict
a
prosperous
one
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
we
go
on
prosperously
enough
for
about
three
week
;
the
ocean
be
as
calm
and
as
smooth
as
a
meadow
,
the
breeze
light
but
good
,
and
we
stem
along
majestically
over
the
deep
blue
water
,
and
pass
coast
after
coast
,
though
all
around
be
nothing
but
the
apparently
pathless
main
in
sight
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
better
sailer
I
never
step
into
,
"
say
the
captain
one
day
;
"
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
live
and
die
in
such
a
vessel
.
"
 
<EOS>
well
,
as
I
say
,
we
have
be
three
week
or
thereabout
,
when
one
morning
,
after
the
sun
be
up
and
the
deck
wash
,
we
see
a
strange
man
sit
on
one
of
the
water
-
cask
that
be
on
deck
,
for
,
be
full
,
we
be
compel
to
stow
some
of
them
on
deck
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
guess
those
on
deck
do
a
little
more
than
stare
at
this
strange
and
unexpected
apparition
.
<EOS>
by
jingo
,
I
never
see
man
open
their
eye
wider
in
all
my
life
,
nor
be
I
any
exception
to
the
rule
.
<EOS>
I
stare
,
as
well
I
may
;
but
we
say
nothing
for
some
minute
,
and
the
stranger
look
calmly
on
us
,
and
then
cock
his
eye
with
a
nautical
air
up
at
the
sky
,
as
if
he
expect
to
receive
a
twopenny
-
post
letter
from
St.
Michael
,
or
a
_
billet
doux
_
from
the
Virgin
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
"
where
have
he
come
from
?
"
say
one
of
the
man
in
a
low
tone
to
his
companion
,
who
be
stand
by
him
at
that
moment
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
can
I
tell
?
"
reply
his
companion
.
"
<EOS>
He
may
have
drop
from
the
cloud
;
he
seem
to
be
examine
the
road
;
perhaps
he
be
go
back
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
stranger
sit
all
this
time
with
the
most
extreme
and
provoke
coolness
and
unconcern
;
he
deign
us
but
a
pass
notice
,
but
it
be
very
slight
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
tall
,
spare
man
--
<EOS>
what
be
term
long
and
lathy
--
but
he
be
evidently
a
powerful
man
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
broad
chest
,
and
long
,
sinewy
arm
,
a
hooked
nose
,
and
a
black
,
eagle
eye
.
<EOS>
His
hair
be
curly
,
but
frost
by
age
;
it
seem
as
though
it
have
be
tinge
with
white
at
the
extremity
,
but
he
be
hale
and
active
otherwise
,
to
judge
from
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
this
,
there
be
a
singular
repulsiveness
about
him
that
I
could
not
imagine
the
cause
,
or
describe
;
at
the
same
time
there
be
an
air
of
determination
in
his
wild
and
singular
-
look
eye
,
and
over
their
whole
there
be
decidedly
an
air
and
an
appearance
<EOS>
so
sinister
as
to
be
positively
disagreeable
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
I
,
after
we
have
stand
some
minute
,
"
where
do
you
come
from
,
shipmate
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
look
at
me
and
then
up
at
the
sky
,
in
a
knowing
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
,
come
,
that
will
not
do
;
you
have
none
of
Peter
Wilkins
's
wing
,
and
could
not
come
on
the
aerial
dodge
;
it
will
not
do
;
how
do
you
get
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
give
me
an
awful
wink
,
and
make
a
sort
of
involuntary
movement
,
which
jump
him
up
a
few
inch
,
and
he
bump
down
again
on
the
water
-
cask
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
think
I
,
"
that
he
be
sit
himself
on
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
and
inform
the
captain
,
"
say
I
,
"
of
this
affair
;
he
will
hardly
believe
me
when
I
tell
him
,
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
I
leave
the
deck
and
go
to
the
cabin
,
where
the
captain
be
at
breakfast
,
and
relate
to
him
what
I
have
see
respect
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
the
captain
look
at
me
with
an
air
of
disbelief
,
and
said,--
 
"
what?--do
you
mean
to
say
there
be
a
man
on
board
we
have
not
see
before
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
do
,
captain
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
him
afore
,
and
he
be
sit
beat
his
heel
on
the
water
-
cask
on
deck
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
devil
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
,
I
assure
you
,
sir
;
and
he
will
not
answer
any
question
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
see
to
that
.
<EOS>
I
will
see
if
I
can
not
make
the
lubber
say
something
,
provide
his
tongue
be
not
cut
out
.
<EOS>
but
how
come
he
on
board
?
<EOS>
confound
it
,
he
can
not
be
the
devil
,
and
drop
from
the
moon
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
know
,
captain
,
"
say
I.
<EOS>
"
He
be
evil
-
look
enough
,
to
my
mind
,
to
be
the
father
of
evil
,
but
it
be
ill
bespeak
attention
from
that
quarter
at
any
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
go
on
,
lad
;
I
will
come
up
after
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
leave
the
cabin
,
and
I
hear
the
captain
come
after
me
.
<EOS>
when
I
get
on
deck
,
I
see
he
have
not
move
from
the
place
where
I
leave
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
general
commotion
among
the
crew
when
they
hear
of
the
occurrence
,
and
all
crowd
round
him
,
save
the
man
at
the
wheel
,
who
have
to
remain
at
his
post
.
 
<EOS>
the
captain
now
come
forward
,
and
the
man
fall
a
little
back
as
he
approach
.
<EOS>
for
a
moment
the
captain
stand
silent
,
attentively
examine
the
stranger
,
who
be
excessively
cool
,
and
stand
the
scrutiny
with
the
same
unconcern
that
he
would
have
the
captain
be
look
at
his
watch
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
man
,
"
say
the
captain
,
"
how
do
you
come
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
part
of
the
cargo
,
"
he
say
,
with
an
indescribable
leer
.
 
<EOS>
"
part
of
the
cargo
be
d----d
!
"
say
the
captain
,
in
sudden
rage
,
for
he
think
the
stranger
be
come
his
joke
too
strong
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
be
not
in
the
bill
of
lading
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
contraband
,
"
reply
the
stranger
;
"
and
my
uncle
be
the
great
chain
of
Tartary
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
captain
stare
,
as
well
he
may
,
and
do
not
speak
for
some
minute
;
all
the
while
the
stranger
keep
kick
his
heel
against
the
water
-
cask
and
squint
up
at
the
sky
;
it
make
us
feel
very
queer
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
must
confess
you
be
not
in
the
regular
way
of
trading
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
,
"
say
the
stranger
;
"
<EOS>
I
be
contraband
--
entirely
contraband
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
how
do
you
come
on
board
?
"
 
<EOS>
at
this
question
the
stranger
again
look
curiously
up
at
the
sky
,
and
continue
to
do
so
for
more
than
a
minute
;
he
then
turn
his
gaze
upon
the
captain
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
the
captain
;
<EOS>
"
eloquent
dumb
show
will
not
do
with
me
;
you
do
not
come
,
like
Mother
Shipton
,
upon
a
birch
broom
.
<EOS>
how
do
you
come
on
board
my
vessel
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
walk
on
board
,
"
say
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
walk
on
board
;
and
where
do
you
conceal
yourself
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
below
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
good
;
and
why
do
not
you
stay
below
altogether
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
because
I
want
fresh
air
.
<EOS>
I
be
in
a
delicate
state
of
health
,
you
see
;
it
do
not
do
to
stay
in
a
confined
place
too
long
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
confound
the
binnacle
!
"
say
the
captain
;
it
be
his
usual
oath
when
anything
bother
him
,
and
he
could
not
make
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
confound
the
binnacle!--what
a
delicate
-
look
animal
you
be
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
have
stay
where
you
be
;
your
delicacy
would
have
be
all
the
same
to
me
.
<EOS>
delicate
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
very
,
"
say
the
stranger
,
coolly
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
so
comic
in
the
assertion
of
his
delicateness
of
health
,
that
we
should
all
have
laugh
;
but
we
be
somewhat
scared
,
and
have
not
the
inclination
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
have
you
live
since
you
come
on
board
?
<EOS>
"
inquire
the
captain
.
 
<EOS>
"
very
indifferently
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
how
?
<EOS>
what
have
you
eat
?
<EOS>
and
what
have
you
drink
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
nothing
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
all
I
do
while
be
below
<EOS>
was--
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
suck
my
thumb
like
a
polar
bear
in
its
winter
quarter
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
as
he
speak
the
stranger
put
his
two
thumb
into
his
mouth
,
and
extraordinary
thumb
<EOS>
they
be
,
too
,
for
each
would
have
fill
an
ordinary
man
's
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
"
these
,
"
say
the
stranger
,
pull
them
out
,
and
gaze
at
them
wistfully
,
and
with
a
deep
sigh
<EOS>
he
continued,--
 
<EOS>
"
these
be
thumb
at
one
time
;
but
they
be
nothing
now
to
what
they
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
confound
the
binnacle
!
"
<EOS>
mutter
the
captain
to
himself
,
and
then
he
add
,
aloud,--
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
cheap
living
,
however
;
but
where
be
you
go
to
,
and
why
do
you
come
aboard
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
a
cheap
cruise
,
and
I
be
go
there
and
back
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
that
be
where
we
be
go
,
"
say
the
captain
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
we
be
brother
,
"
exclaim
the
stranger
,
hop
off
the
water
-
cask
like
a
kangaroo
,
and
bound
towards
the
captain
,
hold
out
his
hand
as
though
he
would
have
shake
hand
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
the
captain
;
"
I
can
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
can
not
do
it
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
the
stranger
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
I
can
not
have
anything
to
do
with
contraband
article
;
I
be
a
fair
trader
,
and
do
all
above
board
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
a
chaplain
on
board
,
or
he
should
offer
up
prayer
for
your
preservation
,
and
the
recovery
of
your
health
,
which
seem
so
delicate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be--
"
 
<EOS>
the
stranger
do
not
finish
the
sentence
;
he
merely
screw
his
mouth
up
into
an
incomprehensible
shape
,
and
puff
out
a
lot
of
breath
,
with
some
force
,
and
which
sound
very
much
like
a
whistle
:
but
,
oh
,
what
thick
breath
he
have
,
it
be
as
much
like
smoke
as
anything
I
ever
see
,
and
so
my
shipmate
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
captain
,
"
say
the
stranger
,
as
he
see
him
pace
the
deck
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
just
send
me
up
some
beef
and
biscuit
,
and
some
coffee
royal
--
be
sure
it
be
royal
,
do
you
hear
,
because
I
be
partial
to
brandy
,
it
be
the
only
good
thing
there
be
on
earth
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
shall
not
easily
forget
the
captain
's
look
as
he
turn
towards
the
stranger
,
and
give
his
huge
shoulder
a
shrug
,
as
much
as
to
say,--
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
can
not
help
it
now
;
he
be
here
,
and
I
can
not
throw
him
overboard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
coffee
,
beef
,
and
biscuit
be
send
him
,
and
the
stranger
seem
to
eat
them
with
great
_
gout
_
,
and
drank
the
coffee
with
much
relish
,
and
return
the
thing
,
say
,
 
"
Your
captain
be
an
excellent
cook
;
give
him
my
compliment
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
think
the
captain
would
think
that
be
but
a
left
-
handed
compliment
,
and
look
more
angry
than
pleased
,
but
no
notice
be
take
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
strange
,
but
this
man
have
impress
upon
all
in
the
vessel
some
singular
notion
of
his
be
more
than
he
should
be
--
more
than
a
mere
mortal
,
and
not
one
endeavour
to
interfere
with
him
;
the
captain
be
a
stout
and
dare
-
devil
a
fellow
as
you
would
well
meet
with
,
yet
he
seem
tacitly
to
acknowledge
more
than
he
would
say
,
for
he
never
after
take
any
further
notice
of
the
stranger
nor
he
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
barely
any
conversation
,
simply
a
civil
word
when
they
first
meet
,
and
so
forth
;
but
there
be
little
or
no
conversation
of
any
kind
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
stranger
sleep
upon
deck
,
and
live
upon
deck
entirely
;
he
never
once
go
below
after
we
see
him
,
and
his
own
account
of
be
below
so
long
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
very
well
,
but
the
night
-
watch
do
not
enjoy
his
society
,
and
would
have
willingly
dispense
with
it
at
that
hour
so
particularly
lonely
and
deject
upon
the
broad
ocean
,
and
perhaps
a
thousand
mile
away
from
the
near
point
of
land
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
dread
and
lonely
hour
,
when
no
sound
reach
the
ear
and
disturb
the
wrapt
stillness
of
the
night
,
save
the
whistling
of
the
wind
through
the
cordage
,
or
an
occasional
dash
of
water
against
the
vessel
's
side
,
the
thought
of
the
sailor
be
fix
on
far
distant
object
--
his
own
native
land
and
the
friend
and
love
one
he
have
leave
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
think
of
the
wilderness
before
,
behind
,
and
around
him
;
of
the
immense
body
of
water
,
almost
in
place
bottomless
;
gaze
upon
such
a
scene
,
and
with
thought
as
strange
and
indefinite
as
the
very
boundless
expanse
before
him
,
it
be
no
wonder
if
he
should
become
superstitious
;
the
time
and
place
would
,
indeed
unbidden
,
conjure
up
thought
and
feeling
of
a
fearful
character
and
intensity
.
 
<EOS>
the
stranger
at
such
time
would
occupy
his
favourite
seat
on
the
water
cask
,
and
look
up
at
the
sky
and
then
on
the
ocean
,
and
between
while
he
would
whistle
a
strange
,
wild
,
unknown
melody
.
 
<EOS>
the
flesh
of
the
sailor
use
to
creep
up
in
knot
and
bump
when
they
hear
it
;
the
wind
use
to
whistle
as
an
accompaniment
and
pronounce
fearful
sound
to
their
ear
.
 
<EOS>
the
wind
have
be
highly
favourable
from
the
first
,
and
since
the
stranger
have
be
discover
it
have
blow
fresh
,
and
we
go
along
at
a
rapid
rate
,
stem
the
water
,
and
dash
the
spray
off
from
the
bow
,
and
cut
the
water
like
a
shark
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
very
singular
to
us
,
we
could
not
understand
it
,
neither
could
the
captain
,
and
we
look
very
suspiciously
at
the
stranger
,
and
wish
him
at
the
bottom
,
for
the
freshness
of
the
wind
now
become
a
gale
,
and
yet
the
ship
come
through
the
water
steadily
,
and
away
we
go
before
the
wind
,
as
if
the
devil
drive
us
;
and
<EOS>
mind
I
do
not
mean
to
say
he
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
the
gale
increase
to
a
hurricane
,
and
though
we
have
not
a
stitch
of
canvass
out
,
yet
we
drive
before
the
gale
as
if
we
have
be
shoot
out
of
the
mouth
of
a
gun
.
 
<EOS>
the
stranger
still
sit
on
the
water
cask
,
and
all
night
long
he
keep
up
his
infernal
whistle
.
<EOS>
now
,
sailor
do
not
like
to
hear
any
one
whistle
when
there
be
such
a
gale
blow
over
their
head
<EOS>
--
it
be
like
ask
for
more
;
but
he
would
persist
,
and
the
loud
and
strong
the
wind
blow
,
the
louder
he
whistle
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
there
come
a
storm
of
rain
,
lightning
,
and
wind
.
<EOS>
We
be
toss
mountain
high
,
and
the
foam
rise
over
the
vessel
,
and
often
entirely
over
our
head
,
and
the
man
be
lash
to
their
post
to
prevent
be
wash
away
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
stranger
still
lie
on
the
water
cask
,
kick
his
heel
and
whistle
his
infernal
tune
,
always
the
same
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
wash
away
nor
move
by
the
action
of
the
water
;
indeed
,
we
heartily
hope
and
expect
to
see
both
him
and
the
water
cask
float
overboard
at
every
minute
;
but
,
as
the
captain
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
confound
the
binnacle
!
<EOS>
the
old
water
tub
seem
as
if
it
be
screw
on
to
the
deck
,
and
will
not
move
off
and
he
on
the
top
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
strong
inclination
to
throw
him
overboard
,
and
the
man
converse
in
low
whisper
,
and
come
round
the
captain
,
saying,--
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
come
,
captain
,
to
ask
you
what
you
think
of
this
strange
man
who
have
come
so
mysteriously
on
board
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
what
to
think
,
lad
;
he
be
past
think
about
<EOS>
--
he
be
something
above
my
comprehension
altogether
,
I
promise
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
we
be
think
much
of
the
same
thing
,
captain
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
he
be
not
exactly
one
of
our
sort
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
he
be
no
sailor
,
certainly
;
and
yet
,
for
a
land
lubber
,
he
be
about
as
rum
a
customer
as
ever
<EOS>
I
meet
with
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
he
be
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
stand
salt
water
well
;
and
I
must
say
that
I
could
not
lay
a
top
of
those
water
cask
in
that
style
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
nor
nobody
amongst
us
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
he
be
in
nobody
's
way
,
it
he?--nobody
want
to
take
his
berth
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
 
the
man
look
at
each
other
somewhat
blank
;
they
do
not
understand
the
meaning
at
all
--
far
from
it
;
and
the
idea
of
any
one
be
want
to
take
the
stranger
's
place
on
the
water
cask
be
so
outrageously
ludicrous
,
that
at
any
other
time
they
would
have
consider
it
a
devilish
good
joke
and
have
never
cease
laugh
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
pause
some
minute
,
and
then
one
of
them
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
that
we
envy
him
his
berth
,
captain
,
because
nobody
else
could
live
there
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
any
one
amongst
us
that
have
be
there
would
have
be
wash
overboard
a
thousand
time
over
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
they
would
,
"
say
the
captain
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
he
be
more
than
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
likely
;
but
how
can
I
help
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
think
he
be
the
main
cause
of
all
this
racket
in
the
heavens
--
the
storm
and
hurricane
;
and
that
,
in
short
,
if
he
remain
much
longer
we
shall
all
sink
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
we
be
in
any
danger
,
and
have
the
strange
be
any
power
to
prevent
it
,
he
would
assuredly
do
so
,
lest
he
get
drown
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
we
think
if
he
be
throw
overboard
all
would
be
well
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
captain
,
you
may
depend
upon
it
<EOS>
he
be
the
cause
of
all
the
mischief
.
<EOS>
throw
him
overboard
and
that
be
all
we
want
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
throw
him
overboard
,
even
if
I
could
do
such
a
thing
;
and
I
be
by
no
means
sure
of
anything
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
do
not
ask
it
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
desire
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
leave
to
throw
him
overboard
--
<EOS>
it
be
to
save
our
own
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
let
you
do
any
such
thing
;
he
be
in
nobody
's
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
he
be
always
a
whistling
.
<EOS>
only
hark
now
,
and
in
such
a
hurricane
as
this
,
it
be
dreadful
to
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
what
else
can
we
do
,
<EOS>
sir?--he
be
not
human
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
this
moment
,
the
stranger
's
whistling
come
clear
upon
their
ear
;
there
be
the
same
wild
,
unearthly
note
as
before
,
but
the
cadence
be
strong
,
and
there
be
a
supernatural
clearness
in
all
the
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
now
,
"
say
another
,
"
he
be
kick
the
water
cask
with
his
heel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
confound
the
binnacle
!
"
say
the
captain
;
"
it
sound
like
short
peal
of
thunder
.
<EOS>
go
and
talk
to
him
,
lad
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
if
that
will
not
do
,
sir
,
may
we--
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
ask
me
any
question
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
a
score
of
the
good
man
that
be
ever
bear
could
move
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mind
try
,
"
say
one
.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
the
whole
of
the
man
move
to
the
spot
where
the
water
cask
be
stand
and
the
stranger
lie
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
he
,
whistle
like
fury
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
beat
his
heel
to
the
tune
against
the
empty
cask
.
<EOS>
We
come
up
to
him
,
and
he
take
no
notice
of
us
at
all
,
but
keep
on
in
the
same
way
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hilloa
!
"
shout
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hilloa
!
"
shout
another
.
 
<EOS>
no
notice
,
however
,
be
take
of
us
,
and
one
of
our
number
,
a
big
,
herculean
fellow
,
an
Irishman
,
seize
him
by
the
leg
,
either
to
make
him
get
up
,
or
,
as
we
think
,
to
give
him
a
lift
over
our
head
into
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
have
scarcely
get
his
finger
round
the
calf
of
the
leg
,
when
the
stranger
pinch
his
leg
so
tight
against
the
water
cask
,
that
he
could
not
move
,
and
be
as
effectually
pin
as
if
he
have
be
nail
there
.
<EOS>
the
stranger
,
after
he
have
finish
a
bar
of
the
music
,
rise
gradually
to
a
sit
posture
,
and
without
the
aid
of
his
hand
,
and
look
the
unlucky
fellow
in
the
face
,
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
what
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
hand
,
"
say
the
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
"
take
it
then
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
take
it
,
and
we
see
that
there
be
blood
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
stranger
stretch
out
his
left
hand
,
and
take
him
by
the
breech
,
he
lift
him
,
without
any
effort
,
upon
the
water
-
cask
beside
him
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
stare
at
this
,
and
could
not
help
it
;
and
we
be
quite
convinced
we
could
not
throw
him
overboard
,
but
he
would
probably
have
no
difficulty
in
throw
us
overboard
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
what
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
again
exclaim
to
us
all
.
 
<EOS>
We
look
at
one
another
,
and
have
scarce
courage
to
speak
;
at
length
<EOS>
I
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
We
wish
you
to
leave
off
whistle
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
leave
off
whistle
!

<EOS>
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
and
why
should
I
do
anything
of

<EOS>
"
because
it

You

<EOS>
he
say
,
after
he
take
off
his
cap
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
very
well

look
now

<EOS>
He
get
up
on
the
water

cask
,

stand
bolt
upright
;

run
his
finger
through
his
hair

the
stranger

triumphantly
,

not

<EOS>
"
be
you
satisfied
?
"
 
<EOS>
what
could
we
say?--we
turn
away
and
leave
the
place
,
and
stand
at
our
quarter
--
there
be
no
help

it

we

grin

abide
by
it

<EOS>
as
soon
as
we
have
leave
the
place
he
put
his
cap
on
again
and
sit
down
on
the
water
-
cask
,
and
then
take
leave
of
his
prisoner
,
whom
he
set
free
,

there
lie
at
full
length
on
his

leg

down

once
more

to
whistle
most
furiously
,

beat
time
with
his
foot

<EOS>
for
full
three
week
do
he
continue
at
this
game
night
and
day
,
without
any
interruption
,
save
such
as
he
require
to
consume
enough
coffee
royal
,
junk
,
and
biscuit
,
as
would
have
serve
three
hearty
man

<EOS>
well
,
about
that
time
,
one
night
the
whistling
cease
and
he
begin
to
sing
--
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
it
be
singe
--
such
a
voice
!
<EOS>
Gog
and
Magog
in
Guildhall
,
London
,
when
they
speak
be
nothing
to
him

it
be
awful
;
but
the
wind
calm
down
to
a
fresh
and
stiff
breeze
.
<EOS>
He
continue
at
this
game
for
three
whole
day

night

on
the
fourth
it
cease

when
we

to
take
his
coffee
royal
to
him
he
be
go

We
hunt
about
everywhere

he
be
entirely
go

in
three
week
after
we
safely
cast
anchor
,
have
perform
our
voyage
in
a
good
month
under
the
usual
time
;
and
have
it
be
an
old
vessel
she
would
have

like
a
tub
from
the
straining
;
however
,
we
be
glad
enough
to
get
in
,
and
be
curiously
inquisitive
as
to
what
be
put
in
our
vessel
to
come
back
with
,
for
as
the
captain
said,--

CHAPTER
XXVI
.
 
<EOS>
the
MEETING
by
MOONLIGHT
<EOS>
in
the
park.--the
TURRET
WINDOW
in
the
hall.--the
letter
.
  
<EOS>
[

]
 
<EOS>
the
old
admiral
show
such
a
strong
disposition
to
take
offence
at
Charles
if
he
should
presume
,
for
a
moment
,
to
doubt
the
truth
of
the
narrative
that
be
thus
communicate
to
him
,
that
the
latter
would
not
anger
him
by
so
do
,
but
confine
his
observation
upon
it
to
say
that
he
consider
it
be
very
wonderful
,
and
very
extraordinary
,
and
so
on
,
which
very
well
satisfy
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
be
now
,
however
,
get
far
advanced
,
and
Charles
Holland
begin
to
think
of
his
engagement
with
the
vampyre
.
<EOS>
He
read
and
read
the
letter
over
and
over
again
,
but
he
could
not
come
to
a
correct
conclusion
as
to
whether
it
intend
to
imply
that
he
,
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
would
wish
to
fight
him
at
the
hour
and
place
mention
,
or
merely
give
him
a
meeting
as
a
preliminary
step
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
rather
,
on
the
whole
,
inclined
to
think
that
some
explanation
would
be
offer
by
Varney
,
but
at
all
event
he
persevere
in
his
determination
of
go
well
armed
,
l
anything
in
the
shape
of
treachery
should
be
intend
.
 
<EOS>
as
nothing
of
any
importance
occur
now
in
the
interval
of
time
till
nearly
midnight
,
we
will
at
once
step
to
that
time
,
and
our
reader
will
suppose
it
to
be
a
quarter
to
twelve
o'clock
at
night
,
and
young
Charles
Holland
on
the
point
of
leave
the
house
,
to
keep
his
appointment
by
the
pollard
oak
,
with
the
mysterious
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
 
<EOS>
He
place
his
loaded
pistol
conveniently
in
his
pocket
,
so
that
at
a
moment
's
notice
he
could
lay
hand
on
them
,
and
then
wrap
himself
up
in
a
travel
cloak
he
have
bring
with
him
to
Bannerworth
Hall
,
he
prepare
to
leave
his
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
the
moon
still
shine
,
although
now
somewhat
on
the
wane
,
and
although
there
be
certainly
many
cloud
in
the
sky
<EOS>
they
be
but
of
a
light
fleecy
character
,
and
very
little
interrupted
the
ray
of
light
that
come
from
the
nearly
full
disc
of
the
moon
.
 
<EOS>
from
his
window
he
could
not
perceive
the
spot
in
the
park
where
he
be
to
meet
Varney
,
because
the
room
in
which
he
be
occupy
not
a
sufficiently
high
place
in
the
house
to
enable
him
to
look
over
a
belt
of
tree
that
stop
the
view
.
<EOS>
from
almost
any
of
the
upper
windows
the
pollard
oak
could
be
see
.
 
<EOS>
It
so
happen
now
that
the
admiral
have
be
place
in
a
room
immediately
above
the
one
occupy
by
his
nephew
,
and
,
as
his
mind
be
full
of
how
he
should
manage
with
regard
to
arrange
the
preliminary
of
the
duel
between
Charles
and
Varney
on
the
morrow
,
he
find
it
difficult
to
sleep
;
and
after
remain
in
bed
about
twenty
minute
,
and
find
that
each
moment
he
be
only
get
more
and
more
restless
,
he
adopt
a
course
which
he
always
do
under
such
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
He
rise
and
dress
himself
again
,
intend
to
sit
up
for
an
hour
and
then
turn
into
bed
and
try
a
second
time
to
get
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
no
means
of
get
a
light
,
so
he
draw
the
heavy
curtain
from
before
the
window
,
and
let
in
as
much
of
the
moonlight
as
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
this
window
command
a
most
beautiful
and
extensive
view
,
for
from
it
the
eye
could
carry
completely
over
the
top
of
the
tall
tree
,
so
that
there
be
no
interruption
whatever
to
the
prospect
,
which
be
as
extensive
as
it
be
delightful
.
 
<EOS>
even
the
admiral
,
who
never
would
confess
to
see
much
beauty
in
scenery
where
water
form
not
a
large
portion
of
it
,
could
not
resist
open
his
window
and
look
out
,
with
a
considerable
degree
of
admiration
,
upon
wood
and
dale
,
as
they
be
illuminate
by
the
moon
's
ray
,
soften
,
and
render
,
if
anything
,
more
beautiful
by
the
light
vapour
,
through
which
they
have
to
struggle
to
make
their
way
.
 
<EOS>
Charles
Holland
,
in
order
to
avoid
the
likelihood
of
meeting
with
any
one
who
would
question
him
as
to
where
he
be
go
,
determine
upon
leave
his
room
by
the
balcony
,
which
,
as
we
be
aware
,
present
ample
facility
for
his
so
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
cast
a
glance
at
the
portrait
in
the
panel
before
he
leave
the
apartment
,
and
then
saying,--
 
<EOS>
"
for
you
,
dear
Flora
,
for
you
I
essay
this
meeting
with
the
fearful
original
of
that
portrait
,
"
he
immediately
open
his
window
,
and
step
out
on
to
the
balcony
.
 
<EOS>
young
and
active
as
be
Charles
Holland
,
to
descend
from
that
balcony
present
to
him
no
difficulty
whatever
,
and
he
be
,
in
a
very
few
moment
,
safe
in
the
garden
of
Bannerworth
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
think
,
for
a
moment
,
to
look
up
,
or
he
would
,
in
an
instant
,
have
see
the
white
head
of
his
old
uncle
,
as
it
be
project
over
the
sill
of
the
window
of
his
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
the
drop
of
Charles
from
the
balcony
of
his
window
,
just
make
sufficient
noise
to
attract
the
admiral
's
attention
,
and
,
then
,
before
he
could
think
of
make
any
alarm
,
he
see
Charles
walk
hastily
across
a
grass
plot
,
which
be
sufficiently
in
the
light
of
the
moon
to
enable
the
admiral
at
once
to
recognise
him
,
and
leave
no
sort
of
doubt
as
to
his
positive
identity
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
,
upon
discover
that
it
be
Charles
,
the
necessity
for
make
an
alarm
no
longer
exist
,
and
,
indeed
,
not
know
what
it
be
that
have
induce
him
to
leave
his
chamber
,
a
moment
's
reflection
suggest
to
him
the
propriety
of
not
even
call
to
Charles
,
lest
he
should
defeat
some
discovery
which
he
may
be
about
to
make
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
have
hear
something
,
or
see
something
,
"
think
the
admiral
,
"
and
be
go
to
find
out
what
it
be
.
<EOS>
I
only
wish
I
be
with
him
;
but
up
here
I
can
do
nothing
at
all
,
that
be
quite
clear
.
"
 
<EOS>
Charles
,
he
see
,
walk
very
rapidly
,
and
like
a
man
who
have
some
fix
destination
which
he
wish
to
reach
as
quickly
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
dive
among
the
tree
which
skirt
one
side
of
the
flower
gardens
,
the
admiral
be
more
puzzled
than
ever
,
and
he
said--
 
<EOS>
"
now
where
on
earth
be
he
off
to
?
<EOS>
He
be
fully
dress
,
and
have
his
cloak
about
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
after
a
few
moment
'
reflection
he
decide
that
,
have
see
something
suspicious
,
Charles
must
have
get
up
,
and
dress
himself
,
to
fathom
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
moment
this
idea
become
fairly
impressed
upon
his
mind
,
he
leave
his
bedroom
,
and
descend
to
where
one
of
the
brother
he
know
be
sit
up
,
keep
watch
during
the
night
.
<EOS>
It
be
Henry
who
be
so
on
guard
;
and
when
the
admiral
come
into
the
room
,
he
utter
an
expression
of
surprise
to
find
him
up
,
for
it
be
now
some
time
past
twelve
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
to
tell
you
that
Charles
have
leave
the
house
,
"
say
the
admiral
.
 
<EOS>
"
leave
the
house
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
see
him
just
now
go
across
the
garden
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
you
be
sure
it
be
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
I
see
him
by
the
moonlight
cross
the
green
plot
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
may
depend
he
have
see
or
hear
something
,
and
go
alone
to
find
out
what
it
be
rather
than
give
any
alarm
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
just
what
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
so
.
<EOS>
I
will
follow
him
,
if
you
can
show
me
exactly
which
way
he
go
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
I
can
easily
.
<EOS>
and
in
case
I
should
have
make
any
mistake
,
which
it
be
not
at
all
likely
,
we
can
go
to
his
room
first
and
see
if
it
be
empty
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
good
thought
,
certainly
;
that
will
at
once
put
an
end
to
all
doubt
upon
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
both
immediately
proceed
to
Charles
's
room
,
and
then
the
admiral
's
accuracy
of
identification
of
his
nephew
be
immediately
prove
by
find
that
Charles
be
not
there
,
and
that
the
window
be
wide
open
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
I
be
right
,
"
say
the
admiral
.
 
<EOS>
"
You

cry
Henry
;
"

what
have
we
here

"
 
<EOS>
"
where

<EOS>
"
here
on
the

here
be
no

than
three

Henry
hold

to
the
light

and
after
a
moment
's
inspection
of
them
,
he
say
,
in
a
voice
of
much
surprise,--
 
<EOS>
"

<EOS>

one
to

"
another
to
me
,
and
the
third
to
my
sister
Flora

<EOS>
there
be
some
new
mystery
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
admiral
look
at
the
superscription
of
one
of
the
letter
which
be
hand
to
him
in
silent
amazement
.
<EOS>
then
he
cried,--
 
<EOS>
"
set
down
the
light
,
and
let
us
read
them

"
 
<EOS>
Henry
do
so
,
and
then
they
simultaneously
open
the
epistle
which
be
severally
address
to
them
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
silence
,
as
of
the
very
grave
,
for
some
moment
,
and
then
the
old
admiral
stagger
to
a
seat
,
as
he
exclaimed,--

"

<EOS>

Henry
,
in
a
voice
of
deep
emotion

as
he
allow
the
note

to
him
to
drop
on
to

<EOS>
the
letter
be
exchange
,
and
read
by
each
with
the

breathless
attention
they
have
bestow
upon
their
own
;
after
which
,
they
both
look
at
each
other
in
silence
,
picture
of
amazement
,
and
the
most
absolute
state
of
bewilderment

not

we
at

transcribe

these
words,--

of
course
you
will
perceive
the
prudence

this
letter
     
to

the
fact

I

up
my

I
have
remain
here
long
enough
now

myself
that

vampyre
business

I
be
quite
convinced

if

distress
circumstance
in

your

I
be
     
sure
that
,
far
from

me
for
the
step

this
note

announce

take
,
you
will
be
the

to
give
me
     
credit

an
amount

they
would

be
     
in
any
satisfactory
manner

away

feel
pride

pleasure
in

my
engagement

that
young
     
lady

You
must

yourself
feel

the
amount

to
forego

itself

these

CHAPTER
XXVII
.
 
<EOS>
the
NOBLE
confidence
of
flora
BANNERWORTH
in
her
lover.--her
opinion
of
the
three
LETTERS.--THE
ADMIRAL
's
ADMIRATION
.
  
<EOS>
[
illustration
]
 
to
describe
the
feeling
of
Henry
Bannerworth
on
the
occasion
of
this
apparent
defalcation
from
the
path
of
rectitude
and
honour
by
his
friend
,
as
he
have
fondly
imagine
Charles
Holland
to
be
,
would
be
next
to
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
if
,
as
we
have
take
occasion
to
say
,
it
be
a
positive
fact
,
that
a
noble
and
a
generous
mind
feel
more
acutely
any
heartlessness
of
this
description
from
one
on
whom
it
have
place
implicit
confidence
,
than
the
most
deliberate
and
wicked
of
injury
from
absolute
stranger
,
we
can
easily
conceive
that
Henry
Bannerworth
be
precisely
the
person
to
feel
most
acutely
the
conduct
which
all
circumstance
appear
to
fix
upon
Charles
Holland
,
upon
whose
faith
,
truth
,
and
honour
,
he
would
have
stake
his
very
existence
but
a
few
short
hour
before
.
 
<EOS>
with
such
a
bewilder
sensation
that
he
scarcely
know
where
he
walk
or
whither
to
betake
himself
,
do
he
repair
to
his
own
chamber
,
and
there
he
strove
,
with
what
energy
<EOS>
he
be
able
to
bring
to
the
task
,
to
find
out
some
excuse
,
if
he
could
,
for
Charles
's
conduct
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
find
none
.
<EOS>
view
it
in
what
light
he
would
,
it
present
but
a
picture
of
the
most
heartless
selfishness
it
have
ever
be
his
lot
to
encounter
.
 
<EOS>
the
tone
of
the
letter
,
too
,
which
Charles
have
write
,
materially
aggravate
the
moral
delinquency
of
which
he
have
be
guilty
;
belief
,
far
better
,
<EOS>
have
he
not
attempt
an
excuse
at
all
than
have
attempt
such
excuse
as
be
there
put
down
in
those
epistle
.
 
<EOS>
a
more
cold
blooded
,
dishonourable
proceeding
could
not
possibly
be
conceive
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
appear
,
that
while
he
entertain
a
doubt
with
regard
to
the
reality
of
the
visitation
of
the
vampyre
to
Flora
Bannerworth
,
he
have
be
willing
to
take
to
himself
abundance
of
credit
for
the
most
honourable
feeling
,
and
to
induce
a
belief
in
the
mind
of
all
that
an
exalted
feeling
of
honour
,
as
well
as
a
true
affection
that
would
know
no
change
,
keep
him
at
the
foot
of
her
whom
he
love
.
 
<EOS>
like
some
braggart
,
who
,
when
there
be
no
danger
,
be
a
very
hero
,
but
who
,
the
moment
he
feel
convinced
he
will
be
actually
and
truly
call
upon
for
an
exhibition
of
his
much
-
vaunted
prowess
,
have
Charles
Holland
desert
the
beautiful
girl
who
,
if
anything
,
have
now
certainly
,
in
her
misfortune
,
a
far
high
claim
upon
his
kindly
feeling
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
could
not
sleep
,
although
,
at
the
request
of
George
,
who
offer
to
keep
watch
for
him
the
remainder
of
the
night
he
attempt
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
He
in
vain
say
to
himself
,
"
I
will
banish
from
my
mind
this
most
unworthy
subject
.
<EOS>
I
have
tell
Admiral
Bell
<EOS>
that
contempt
be
the
only
feeling
I
can
now
have
for
his
nephew
,
and
yet
I
now
find
myself
dwell
upon
him
,
and
upon
his
conduct
,
with
a
perseverance
which
be
a
foe
to
my
repose
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
at
length
come
the
welcome
and
beautiful
light
of
day
,
and
Henry
rise
fevered
and
unrefreshed
.
 
<EOS>
His
first
impulse
now
be
to
hold
a
consultation
with
his
brother
George
,
as
to
what
be
to
be
do
,
and
George
advise
that
Mr.
Marchdale
,
who
as
yet
know
nothing
of
the
matter
,
should
be
immediately
inform
of
it
,
and
consult
,
as
be
probably
better
qualified
than
either
of
them
to
come
to
a
just
,
a
cool
,
and
a
reasonable
opinion
upon
the
painful
circumstance
,
which
it
could
not
be
expect
that
either
of
them
would
be
able
to
view
calmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
it
be
so
,
then
,
"
say
Henry
;
"
Mr.
Marchdale
shall
decide
for
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
at
once
seek
this
friend
of
the
family
,
who
be
in
his
own
bed
-
room
,
and
when
Henry
knock
at
the
door
,
Marchdale
open
it
hurriedly
,
eagerly
inquire
what
be
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
alarm
,
"
say
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
only
come
to
tell
you
of
a
circumstance
which
have
occur
during
the
night
,
and
which
will
somewhat
surprise
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
nothing
calamitous
,
I
hope
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
vexatious
;
and
yet
,
I
think
it
be
a
matter
upon
which
we
ought
almost
to
congratulate
ourselves
.
<EOS>
read
those
two
letter
,
and
give
us
your
candid
opinion
upon
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
Henry
place
in
Mr.
Marchdale
's
hand
the
letter
address
to
himself
,
as
well
as
that
to
the
admiral
.
 
<EOS>
Marchdale
read
them
both
with
marked
attention
,
but
he
do
not
exhibit
in
his
countenance
so
much
surprise
as
regret
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
finish
,
Henry
say
to
him,--
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
Marchdale
,
what
think
you
of
this
new
and
extraordinary
episode
in
our
affair
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
young
friend
,
"
say
Marchdale
,
in
a
voice
of
great
emotion
<EOS>
,
"
I
know
not
what
to
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
but
that
you
be
both
of
you
much
astonish
at
the
receipt
of
these
letter
,
and
equally
so
at
the
sudden
absence
of
Charles
Holland
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
be
not
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
so
much
as
you
,
doubtless
,
be
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
I
never
do
entertain
a
favourable
opinion
of
the
young
man
,
and
he
know
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
accustom
to
the
study
of
human
nature
under
a
variety
of
aspect
;
I
have
make
it
a
matter
of
deep
,
and
I
may
add
,
sorrowful
,
contemplation
,
to
study
and
remark
those
minor
shade
of
character
which
commonly
escape
observation
wholly
.
<EOS>
and
,
I
repeat
,
I
always
have
a
bad
opinion
of
Charles
Holland
,
which
he
guess
,
and
hence
he
conceive
a
hatred
to
me
,
which
more
than
once
,
as
you
can
not
but
remember
,
show
itself
in
little
act
of
opposition
and
hostility
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
much
surprise
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
expect
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
but
you
can
not
help
remember
that
at
one
time
I
be
on
the
point
of
leave
here
solely
on
his
account
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
should
have
do
so
,
but
that
I
reason
with
myself
upon
the
subject
,
and
subdue
the
impulse
of
the
anger
which
some
year
ago
,
when
I
have
not
see
so
much
of
the
world
,
would
have
guide
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
why
do
you
not
impart
to
us
your
suspicion
?
<EOS>
We
should
at
least
,
then
,
have
be
prepare
for
such
a
contingency
as
have
occur
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
place
yourself
in
my
position
,
and
then
yourself
what
you
would
have
do
.
<EOS>
suspicion
be
one
of
those
hideous
thing
which
all
man
should
be
most
specially
careful
not
only
how
they
entertain
at
all
,
but
how
they
give
expression
to
.
<EOS>
besides
,
whatever
may
be
the
amount
of
one
's
own
internal
conviction
with
regard
to
the
character
of
any
one
,
there
be
just
a
possibility
that
one
may
be
wrong
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
true
,
true
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
possibility
ought
to
keep
any
one
silent
who
have
nothing
but
suspicion
to
go
upon
,
however
cautious
<EOS>
it
may
make
him
,
as
regard
his
dealing
with
the
individual
.
<EOS>
I
only
suspect
from
little
minute
shade
of
character
,
that
would
peep
out
in
spite
of
him
,
that
Charles
Holland
be
not
the
honourable
man
he
would
fain
<EOS>
have
have
everybody
believe
him
to
be
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
have
you
from
the
first
such
a
feeling
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
strange
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
and
what
be
more
strange
still
,
be
that
he
from
the
first
seem
to
know
it
;
and
despite
a
caution
which
I
could
see
he
always
keep
uppermost
in
his
thought
,
he
could
not
help
speak
tartly
to
me
at
time
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
notice
that
,
"
say
George
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
depend
it
be
a
fact
,
"
add
Marchdale
,
"
that
nothing
so
much
excite
the
deadly
and
desperate
hatred
of
a
man
who
be
act
a
hypocritical
part
,
as
the
suspicion
,
well
ground
or
not
,
that
another
see

understand
the
secret
impulse
of
his
dishonourable
heart
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
blame
you
,
or
any
one
else
,
Mr.
Marchdale
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
that
you
do
not
give
utterance
to
your
secret
thought

I
do
wish
that
you
have
do
so

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
dear
Henry
,
"
reply
Mr.
Marchdale
,
"
believe
me
,
I
have
make
this
matter
a
subject
of
deep
thought
,
and
have
abundance
of
reason
why
I
ought
not
to
have
speak
to
you
upon
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
have
,
and
not
among
the
least
important
be
the
one
,
that
if
I
have
acquaint
you
with
my
suspicion
,
you
would
have
find
yourself
in
the
painful
position
of
act
a
hypocritical
part
yourself
towards
this
Charles
Holland
,
for
you
must
either
have
keep
the
secret
that
he
be
suspect
,
or
you
must
have
shew
it
to
him
by
your
behaviour
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
well
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
,
Marchdale
,
you
act
for
the
good
.
<EOS>
what
shall
we
do
now
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Can
you
doubt
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
think
of
let
Flora
at
once
<EOS>
know
the
absolute
and
complete
worthlessness
of
her
lover
,
so
that
she
could
have
no
difficulty
in
at
once
tear
herself
from
him
by
the
assistance
of
the
natural
pride

would
surely
come
to
her
aid

upon
find
herself
so
much
deceive
.

test
may
be
possible

You
think
so
?

"
I
do

indeed

"
 
<EOS>
"
here
be
a
letter
,
which
of
course
remain
unopened
,
address
to
Flora
by
Charles
Holland
.
<EOS>
the
admiral
rather
think
it
would
hurt
her
feeling
to
deliver
her
such
an
epistle
,
but
I
must
confess
I
am
of
a
contrary
opinion
upon
that
point
,
and
think
now
the
more
evidence
she
have
of
the
utter
worthlessness
of
him
who
profess
to
love
her
with
so
much
disintereste

You
could
not

Henry

have
take
a
more
sensible
view
of
the
subject

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
you
agree
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
reasonable
man
could
do
otherwise
,
and
from
what
I
have
see
of
Admiral
Bell
,
I
be
sure
,
upon
reflection
,
he
will
be
of
the
same
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
it
shall
be
so
.
<EOS>
the
first
shock
to
poor
Flora
may
be
severe
,
but
we
shall
then
have
the
consolation
of
know
that
it
be
the
only
one
,
and
that
in
know
the
very
bad
,
she
have
no
more
on
that
score
to
apprehend
.
<EOS>
alas
,
alas
!
<EOS>
the
hand
of
misfortune
now
appear
to
have
press
heavily
upon
us
indeed
.
<EOS>
what
in
the
name
of
all
that
be
unlucky
and
disastrous
,
will
happen
next
,
I
wonder
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
can
happen
?
"
say
Marchdale
;
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
have
now
get
rid
of
the
great
evil
of
all
--
a
false
friend
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
go
,
then
,
to
Flora
;
assure
her
that
in
the
affection
of
other
who
know
no
falsehood
,
she
will
find
a
solace
from
every
ill
.
<EOS>
assure
her
that
there
be
heart
that
will
place
themselves
between
her
and
every
misfortune
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Marchdale
be
much
affect
as
he
speak
.
<EOS>
probably
he
feel
deep
than
he
choose
to
express
the
misfortune
of
that
family
for
whom
he
entertain
so
much
friendship
.
<EOS>
He
turn
aside
his
head
to
hide
the
trace
of
emotion
which
,
despite
even
his
great
power
of
self
-
command
,
would
shew
themselves
upon
his
handsome
and
intelligent
countenance
.
<EOS>
then
it
appear
as
if
his
noble
indignation
have
get
,
for
a
few
brief
moment
,
the
well
of
all
prudence
,

he
exclaimed,--

"
the
villain

<EOS>
the
bad

villain

who
would
,
with

thousand
artifice

make
himself
beloved

unsuspecting

then

bitterness

regret

this

<EOS>
the
expression
that
sit
upon

quite
sufficient
to
convince

<EOS>
exculpation
of
himself.--the

MYSTERIOUS
PAPER

[

<EOS>
It
be
,
perhaps
,
very
natural
that
,
with
her
feeling
towards
Charles
Holland
,
Flora
should
shrink
from
every
one
who
seem
to
be
of
a
directly
contrary
impression
,
and
when
Mr.
Marchdale
now
speak
,
she
show
but
little
inclination
to
hear
what
he
have
to
say
in
explanation
.
 
<EOS>
the
genuine
and
unaffected
manner
,
however
,
in
which
he
speak
,
could
not
but
have
its
effect
upon
her
,
and
she
find
herself
compel
to
listen
,
as
well
as
,
to
a
great
extent
,
approve
of
the
sentiment
that
fall
from
his
lip
.
 
<EOS>
"
Flora
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
beg
that
you
will
here
,
in
the
presence
of
your
mother
,
give
me
a
patient
hearing
.
<EOS>
You
fancy
that
,
because
I
can
not
join
so
glibly
as
the
admiral
in
believe
that
these
letter
be
forgery
,
I
must
be
your
enemy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
those
letter
,
"
say
Flora
,
"
be
not
write
by
Charles
Holland
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
your
opinion
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
more
than
an
opinion
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
write
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
of
course
,
if
I
feel
inclined
,
which
Heaven
alone
know
I
do
not
,
I
could
not
hope
successfully
to
argue
against
such
a
conviction
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
wish
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
all
I
want
to
impress
upon
you
be
,
that
I
be
not
to
be
blame
for
doubt
his
innocence
;
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
I
wish
to
assure
you
that
no
one
in
this
house
would
feel
more
exquisite
satisfaction
than
I
in
see
it
establish
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
for
so
much
,
"
say
Flora
;
"
<EOS>
but
as
,
to
my
mind
,
his
innocence
have
never
be
doubt
,
it
need
to
me
no
establishing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
good
.
<EOS>
You
believe
these
letter
forgery
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
that
the
disappearance
of
Charles
Holland
be
enforce
,
and
not
of
his
own
free
will
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
may
rely
upon
my
unremitting
exertion
night
and
day
to
find
him
and
any
suggestion
you
can
make
,
which
be
likely
to
aid
in
the
search
,
shall
,
I
pledge
myself
,
be
fully
carry
out

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
,
Mr.
Marchdale

"
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
say
the
mother
,
"
rely
on
Mr.

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
rely
on
any
one
who
believe
Charles

innocent

odious

upon

<EOS>
"

so
will
Mr.

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
to
hear
it

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
yet
doubt
it

Flora
,
"
say
Marchdale
,
dejectedly
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
sorry
that
such
should
be
the
case

I
will
not
,
however
,
trouble
you
any
further

up
this

"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
Mr.
Marchdale
bow
,
and
leave
the
room
,
apparently
more
vexed
than
he
care
to
express
at
the
misconstruction
which
have
be
put
upon
his
conduct
and
motive
.
<EOS>
He
at
once
seek
Henry
and
the
admiral
,
to
whom
he
express
his
most
earnest
desire
to
aid
in
attempt
to
unravel
the
mysterious

have
occur

<EOS>
"
this
strongly
-
express
opinion
of
Flora
<EOS>
,
"
he
remark
,
"
be
of
course
amply
sufficient
to
induce
us
to
pause
before
we
say
one
word
more
that
shall
in
any
way
sound
like
a
condemnation
of
Mr.

<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
that
I
should

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no

"
say
the

"
do
not

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

<EOS>

I

<EOS>
"
Sir

if
you
use
that
as
a
threat--
"
 
"
a
threat
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
must
say
,
it
sound
marvellously
like
one
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
dear
,
no

quite
a
mistake

<EOS>
I
consider
that
every
man
have
a
fair
right
to
the
enjoyment
of
his
opinion

<EOS>
all
I
have
to
remark
be
,
that
I
shall
,
after
what
have
occur

feel
myself
call
upon

fight
anybody

<EOS>
"
ah
,
indeed

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
permit
me
to
say
such
be
a
strange
mode
of
allow
every

the
free
enjoyment

not

whatever

"
yes

most
certainly

upon

"
 
<EOS>
"
upon
the
ground
that
you
be
a

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
come

"
now
interpose
Henry
,
"
let
me
hope
that

for
my

well

Flora

,
this
dispute
will
proceed
no
further

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
court
it

"

Marchdale

<EOS>
"
I
have
much
temper

but
I
be
not
a
stick
or
a
stone

<EOS>
"
D----e
,
if
I
do
not

"
you
be

of
both

"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Henry
Bannerworth

"

Marchdale

"
I
be
your
guest

<EOS>
but
for
the
duty
I
feel
in
assist
in
the

I
should
at
once
leave
your
house

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
trouble
yourself
on

the
admiral

"
if
I
find
no
clue
to
him
in
the
neighbourhood
for
two
or
three
day

I
shall
be
off
myself

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
,
"
say
Henry

rise
,

to
search
the
garden

adjoining
meadow
;
if
you
two
gentleman
choose
to
come
with
me
,
I
shall
of
course
be
happy
of
your
company
;
if
,
however
,
you
prefer
remain
here
to
wrangle
,
you
can
do
so

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
have
the
effect
,
at
all
event
,
of
put
a
stop
to
the
dispute
for
the
present
,
and
both
the
admiral
and
Mr.
Marchdale
accompany
Henry
on
his
search
.
<EOS>
that
search
be
commence
immediately
under
the
balcony
of
Charles
Holland
's
window
,
from
which
the
admiral
have
see
him
emerge
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
particular
find
there
,
or
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
Admiral
Bell
point
out
accurately
the
route
he
have
see
Charles
take
across
the
grass
plot
just
before
he
himself
leave
his
chamber
to
seek
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
this
route
be
now
take
,
and
it
lead
to
a
low
part
of
the
garden
wall
,
which
any
one
of
ordinary
vigour
could
easily
have
surmount
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
impression
be
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
"
that
he
get
over
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
ivy
appear
to
be
disturb
,
"
remark
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
suppose
we
mark
the
spot
,
and
then
go
round
to
it
on
the
outer
side
?
"
suggest
George
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
agree
to
;
for
,
although
the
young
man
may
have
choose
rather
to
clamber
over
the
wall
than
go
round
,
it
be
doubtful
if
the
old
admiral
could
accomplish
such
a
feat
.
 
<EOS>
the
distance
round
,
however
,
be
not
great
,
and
as
they
have
cast
over
the
wall
a
handful
of
flower
from
the
garden
to
mark
the
precise
spot
,
it
be
easily
discoverable
.
 
<EOS>
the
moment
they
reach
it
,
they
be
panic
-
stricken
by
the
appearance
which
it
present
.
<EOS>
the
grass
be
for
some
yard
round
about
completely
trodden
up
,
and
convert
into
mud
.
<EOS>
there
be
deep
indentation
of
foot
-
mark
in
all
direction
,
and
such
abundance
of
evidence
that
some
most
desperate
struggle
have
recently
take
place
there
,
that
the
most
sceptical
person
in
the
world
could
not
have
entertain
any
doubt
upon
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
be
the
first
to
break
the
silence
with
which
they
each
regard
the
broken
ground
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
conclusive
to
my
mind
,
"
he
say
,
with
a
deep
sigh
.
"
<EOS>
here
have
poor
Charles
be
attack
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
God
keep
him
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Marchdale
,
"
and
pardon
me
my
doubt
<EOS>
--
I
be
now
convinced
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
old
admiral
gaze
about
him
like
one
distract
.
<EOS>
suddenly
he
cried--
 
<EOS>
"
They
have
murder
him
.
<EOS>
some
fiend
in
the
shape
of
man
have
murder
him
,
and
Heaven
only
know
for
what
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
seem
but
too
probable
,
"
say
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
let
us
endeavour
to
trace
the
footstep
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Flora
,
Flora
,
what
terrible
news
this
will
be
to
you

"
 
<EOS>
"
a
horrible
supposition
come
across
my
mind
,
"
say
George
.
<EOS>
"
what
if
he
meet
the
vampyre
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
have
be
so
,
"
say
Marchdale
,
with
a
shudder
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
point
which
we
should
endeavour
to
ascertain
,
and
I
think
we
may
do
so
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
by
some
inquiry
as
to
whether
Sir
Francis
Varney
be
from
home
at
midnight
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
true
;
that
may
be
do
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
question
,
suddenly
put
to
one
of
his
servant
,
would
,
most
probably
,
be
answer
as
a
thing
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
that
shall
be
decide
upon
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
my
friend
,
since
you
have
some
of
you
think
me
luke
-
warm
in
this
business
,
I
pledge
myself
that
,
should
it
be
ascertain
that
Varney
be
from
home
at
midnight
last
evening
,
I
will
defy
him
personally
,
and
meet
him
hand
to
hand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
nay
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
leave
that
course
to
young
hand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
so
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
more
befit
me
to
be
his
challenger
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
Henry
.
<EOS>
You
be
differently
situate
to
what
I
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
so
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
remember
,
that
I
be
in
the
world
a
lone
man
;
without
tie
or
connexion

<EOS>
if
I
lose
my

I
compromise
no

you

It

Mystery

what

unfathomable
mystery

in

,
no

give
an

after
a

it

it

a

I

Marchdale
could
not

who
think
no

he
make
no

only
wait

as
do
Henry

with
evident
anxiety
for
the
return
of
George

<EOS>
the
distance
be
not
great

George
certainly
perform
his
errand
quickly

he
be
back

the

[

without
forestall
the
interest
of
our
story
,
or
record
a
fact
in
its
wrong
place
,
we
now
call
our
reader
'
attention
to
a
circumstance
which
may
,
at
all
event
,
afford
some
food
for
conjecture
.
 
<EOS>
some
distance
from
the
Hall
,
which
,
from
time
immemorial
,
have
be
the
home
and
the
property
of
the
Bannerworth
family
,
be
an
ancient
ruin
know
by
the
name
of
the
Monks
'
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
conjecture
that
this
ruin
be
the
remain
of
some
one
of
those
half
monastic
,
half
military
building
which
,
during
the
middle
age
,
be
so
common
in
almost
every
command
situation
in
every
county
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
at
a
period
of
history
when
the
church
arrogate
to
itself
an
amount
of
political
power
which
the
intelligence
of
the
spirit
of
the
age
now
deny
to
it
,
and
when
its
member
be
quite
ready
to
assert
at
any
time
the
truth
of
their
doctrine
by
the
strong
arm
of
power
,
such
building
as
the
one
,
the
old
grey
ruin
of
which
be
situate
near
to
Bannerworth
Hall
,
be
erect
.
 
<EOS>
ostensibly
for
religious
purpose
,
but
really
as
a
stronghold
for
defence
,
as
well
as
for
aggression
,
this
Monks
'
Hall
,
as
it
be
call
,
partook
quite
as
much
of
the
character
of
a
fortress
,
as
of
an
ecclesiastical
building
.
 
<EOS>
the
ruin
cover
a
considerable
extent
,
of
ground
,
but
the
only
part
which
seem
successfully
to
have
resist
the
encroache
of
time
,
at
least
to
a
considerable
extent
,
be
a
long
,
hall
in
which
the
jolly
monk
no
doubt
feasted
and
carouse
.
 
<EOS>
adjoin
to
this
hall
,
be
the
wall
of
other
part
of
the
building
,
and
at
several
place
there
be
small
,
low
,
mysterious
-
look
door
that
lead
<EOS>
,
heaven
know
where
,
into
some
intricacy
and
labyrinth
beneath
the
building
,
which
no
one
have
,
within
the
memory
of
man
,
be
content
to
run
the
risk
of
lose
himself
in
.

[

<EOS>
It
be
relate
that
among
these
subterranean
passage
and
arch
there
be
pitfall
and
pool
of
water
;
and
whether
such
a
statement
be
true
or
not
,
it
certainly
act
as
a
considerable
damper
upon
the
vigour
of
curiosity
.
 
<EOS>
this
ruin
be
so
well
known
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
have
become
from
early
childhood
so
familiar
to
the
inhabitant
of
Bannerworth
Hall
,
that
one
would
as
soon
expect
an
old
inhabitant
of
Ludgate
-
hill
to
make
some
remark
about
St.
Paul
's
,
as
any
of
them
to
allude
to
the
ruin
of
Monks
'
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
They
never
now
think
of
go
near
to
it
,
for
in
infancy
they
have
spoil
among
its
ruin
,
and
it
have
become
one
of
those
familiar
object
which
,
almost
,
from
that
very
familiarity
,
cease
to
hold
a
place
in
the
memory
of
those
who
know
it
so
well
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
,
however
,
to
this
ruin
we
would
now
conduct
our
reader
,
premise
that
what
we
have
to
say
concern
it
now
,
be
not
precisely
in
the
form
of
a
connect
portion
of
our

It
be
evening
--
the
evening
of
that
first
day
of
heart
loneliness
to
poor
Flora
Bannerworth
.
<EOS>
the
linger
ray
of
the
set
sun
be
gild
the
old
ruin
with
a
wondrous
beauty
.
<EOS>
the
edge
of
the
decay
stone
seem
now
to
be
tip
with
gold
,
and
as
the
rich
golden
refulgence
of
light
gleam
upon
the
paint
glass
which
still
adorn
a
large
window
of
the
hall
,
a
flood
of
many
-
coloured
beautiful
light
be
cast
within
,
make
the
old
flag
-
stone
,
with
which
the
interior
be
pave
,
look
more
like
some
rich
tapestry
,
lay
down
to
do
honour
to
a
monarch
.
 
<EOS>
so
picturesque
and
so
beautiful
an
aspect
<EOS>
do
the
ancient
ruin
wear
,
that
to
one
with
a
soul
to
appreciate
the
romantic
and
the
beautiful
,
it
would
have
amply
repay
the
fatigue
of
a
long
journey
now
to
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
the
sun
sink
to
rest
,
the
gorgeous
colour
that
it
cast
upon
the
mouldering
wall
,
deepen
from
an
appearance
of
burnished
gold
to
a
crimson
hue
,
and
from
that
again
the
colour
change
to
a
shift
purple
,
mingle
with
the
shadow
of
the
evening
,
and
so
gradually
fade
away
into
absolute
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
the
place
be
as
silent
as
the
tomb
--
a
silence
far
more
solemn
than
could
have
exist
,
have
there
be
no
remain
of
a
human
habitation
;
because
even
these
time
-
wear
wall
be
suggestive
of
what
once
have
be
;
and
the
wrapt
stillness
which
now
pervade
them
bring
with
them
a
melancholy
feeling
for
the
past
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
even
the
low
hum
of
insect
life
to
break
the
stillness
of
these
ancient
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
the
last
ray
of
the
sun
be
gradually
fade
away
.
<EOS>
in
a
short
time
all
will
be
darkness
.
<EOS>
a
low
gentle
wind
be
get
up
,
and
begin
slightly
to
stir
the
tall
blade
of
grass
that
have
shoot
up
between
some
of
the
old
stone
.
<EOS>
the
silence
be
break
,
awfully
break
,
by
a
sudden
cry
of
despair
;
such
a
cry
as
may
come
from
some
imprisoned
spirit
,
doom
to
waste
an
age
of
horror
in
a
tomb
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
it
be
scarcely
to
be
call
a
scream
,
and
<EOS>
not
all
a
groan
.
<EOS>
It
may
have
come
from
some
one
on
the
moment
of
some
dreadful
sacrifice
,
when
the
judgment
have
not
sufficient
time
to
call
courage
to
its
aid
,
but
involuntarily
have
induce
that
sound
which
may
not
be
repeat
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
startled
bird
fly
from
odd
hole
and
corner
about
the
ruin
,
to
seek
some
other
place
of
rest
.
<EOS>
the
owl
hoot
from
a
corner
of
what
have
once
be
a
belfry
,
and
a
dreamy
-
looking
bat
fly
out
from
a
cranny
and
strike
itself
headlong
against
a
projection
.
 
<EOS>
then
all
be
still
again
.
<EOS>
silence
resume
its
reign
,
and
if
there
have
be
a
mortal
ear
to
drink
in
that
sudden
sound
,
the
mind
may
well
have
doubt
if
fancy
have
not
more
to
do
with
the
matter
than
reality
.
 
<EOS>
from
out
a
portion
of
the
ruin
that
be
envelop
in
the
deep
gloom
,
there
now
glide
a
figure
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
gigantic
height
,
and
it
move
along
with
a
slow
and
measured
tread
.
<EOS>
an
ample
mantle
envelope
the
form
,
which
may
well
have
be
take
for
the
spirit
of
one
of
the
monk
who
,
century
since
,
have
make
that
place
their
home
.
 
<EOS>
It
walk
the
whole
length
of
the
ample
hall
we
have
allude
to
,
and
then
,
at
the
window
from
which
have
stream
the
long
flood
of
many
coloured
light
,
it
pause
.
 
<EOS>
for
more
than
ten
minute
this
mysterious
looking
figure
there
stand
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
there
pass
something
on
the
outside
of
the
window
<EOS>
,
that
look
like
the
shadow
of
a
human
form
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
tall
,
mysterious
,
apparition
-
looking
man
turn
,
and
seek
a
side
entrance
to
the
hall
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
pause
,
and
,
in
about
a
minute
,
he
be
join
by
another
who
must
have
be
he
who
have
so
recently
pass
the
stained
glass
window
on
the
outer
side
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
friendly
salutation
between
these
two
being
,
and
they
walk
to
the
centre
of
the
hall
,
where
they
remain
for
some
time
in
animate
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
gesture
they
use
,
it
be
evident
that
the
subject
of
their
discourse
be
one
of
deep
and
absorb
interest
to
both
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
,
too
,
upon
which
,
after
a
time
,
they
seem
a
little
to
differ
,
and
more
than
once
they
each
assume
attitude
of
mutual
defiance
.
 
<EOS>
this
continue
until
the
sun
have
so
completely
sink
,
that
twilight
be
begin
sensibly
to
wane
,
and
then
gradually
the
two
man
appear
to
have
come
to
a
well
understanding
,
and
whatever
may
be
the
subject
of
their
discourse
<EOS>
,
there
be
some
positive
result
evidently
arrive
at
now
.
 
<EOS>
They
speak
in
low
tone
.
<EOS>
They
use
less
animate
gesture
than
before
;
and
,
after
a
time
,
they
both
walk
slowly
down
the
hull
towards
the
dark
spot
from
whence
the
first
tall
figure
have
so
mysteriously
emerge

exhalation

deep

the
prisoner
be
lie
on
his
back
;
a
rude
bandage
round
his
head
,
on
which
be
numerous
spot
of
blood
,
would
seem
to
indicate
that
he
have
suffer
personal
injury
in
some
recent
struggle
.
<EOS>
His
eye
be
open
.
<EOS>
They
be
fix
desparingly
,
perhaps
unconsciously
,
upon
that
small
grating
which
look
into
the
upper
world
.
 
<EOS>
that
grate
slant
upwards
,
and
look
to
the
west
,
so
that
any
one
confine
in
that
dreary
dungeon
may
be
tantalize
,
on
a
sweet
summer
's
day
,
by
see
the
sweet
blue
sky
,
and
occasionally
the
white
cloud
flit
by
in
that
freedom
which
he
can
not
hope
for
.
 
<EOS>
the
carol
of
a
bird
,
too
,
may
reach
him
there
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
sad
remembrance
of
life
,
and
joy
,
and
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
all
be
deepen
gloom
.
<EOS>
the
prisoner
see
nothing
--
hear
nothing
;
and
the
sky
be
not
quite
dark
.
<EOS>
that
small
grating
look
like
a
strange
light
-
patch
in
the
dungeon
wall
.
 
<EOS>
Hark
!
<EOS>
some
footstep
sound
upon
his
ear
.
<EOS>
the
creaking
of
a
door
follow
--
a
gleam
of
light
shine
into
the
dungeon
,
and
the
tall
mysterious
-
look
figure
in
the
cloak
stand
before
the
occupant
of
that
wretched
place
.
 
<EOS>
then
come
in
the
other
man
,
and
he
carry
in
his
hand
writing
material
.
<EOS>
He
stoop
to
the
stone
couch
on
which
the
prisoner
lie
,
and
offer
him
a
pen
,
as
he
raise
him
partially
from
the
miserable
damp
pallet
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
speculation
in
the
eye
of
that
oppress
man
.
<EOS>
in
vain
the
pen
be
repeatedly
place
in
his
grasp
,
and
a
document
of
some
length
,
write
on
parchment
,
spread
out
before
him
to
sign
.
<EOS>
in
vain
be
he
hold
up
now
by
both
the
man
,
who
have
thus
mysteriously
seek
him
in
his
dungeon
;
he
have
not
power
to
do
as
they
would
wish
him
.
<EOS>
the
pen
fall
from
his
nerveless
grasp
,
and
,
with
a
deep
sigh
,
when
they
cease
to
hold
him
up
,
he
fall
heavily
back
upon
the
stone
couch
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
two
man
look
at
each
other
for
about
a
minute
silently
;
after
which
he
who
be
the
short
of
the
two
raise
one
hand
,
and
,
in
a
voice
of
such
concentrated
hatred
and
passion
as
be
horrible
to
hear
,
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
D
--
n
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
reply
of
the
other
be
a
laugh
;
and
then
he
take
the
light
from
the
floor
,
and
motion
the
one
who
seem
so
little
able
to
control
his
feeling
of
bitterness
and
disappointment
to
leave
the
place
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
with
a
haste
and
vehemence
,
then
,
which
show
how
much
angered
he
be
,
the
short
man
of
the
two
now
roll
up
the
parchment
,
and
place
it
in
a
breast
-
pocket
of
his
coat
.
 
<EOS>
He
cast
a
withering
look
of
intense
hatred
on
the
form
of
the
nearly
-
unconscious
prisoner
,
and
then
prepare
to
follow
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
they
reach
the
door
of
the
dungeon
,
the
tall
man
of
the
two
pause
,
and
appear
for
a
moment
or
two
to
be
in
deep
thought
;
after
which
he
hand
the
lamp
he
carry
to
his
companion
,
and
approach
the
pallet
of
the
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
from
his
pocket
a
small
bottle
,
and
,
raise
the
head
of
the
feeble
and
wounded
man
,
he
pour
some
portion
of
the
content
into
his
mouth
,
and
watch
him
swallow
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
other
look
on
in
silence
,
and
then
they
both
slowly
leave
the
dreary
dungeon
.
 
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
*
 
<EOS>
the
wind
rise
,
and
the
night
have
deepen
into
the
utmost
darkness
.
<EOS>
the
blackness
of
a
night
,
unillumine
by
the
moon
,
which
would
not
now
rise
for
some
hour
,
be
upon
the
ancient
ruin
.
<EOS>
all
be
calm
and
still
,
and
no
one
would
have
suppose
that
aught
human
be
within
those
ancient
,
dreary
looking
wall
.
 
<EOS>
Time
will
show
who
it
be
who
lie
in
that
unwholesome
dungeon
,
as
well
as
who
be
they
who
visit
him
so
mysteriously
,
and
retire
again
with
feeling
of
such
evident
disappointment
with
the
document
it
seem
of
such
importance
,
at

to
one
of
them

unconscious

Admiral
Bell
have
,
of
course
,
nothing
particular
to
communicate
to
Flora
in
the
walk
he
induce
her
to
take
with
him
in
the
garden
of
Bannerworth
Hall
,
but
he
could
talk
to
her
upon
a
subject
which
be
sure
to
be
a
welcome
one
,
namely
,
of
Charles
Holland
.
 
<EOS>
and
not
only
could
he
talk
to
her
of
Charles
,
but
he
be
willing
to
talk
of
him
in
the
style
of
enthusiastic
commendation
which
assimilate
best
with
her
own
feeling
.
<EOS>
no
one
but
the
honest
old
admiral
,
who
be
as
violent
in
his
like
and
his
dislikes
as
any
one
could
possibly
be
,
could
just
then
have
converse
with
Flora
Bannerworth
to
her
satisfaction
of
Charles
Holland
.
 
<EOS>
He
express
no
doubt
whatever
concern
Charles
's
faith
,
and
to
his
mind
,
now
that
he
have
get
that
opinion
firmly
fix
in
his
mind
,
everybody
that
hold
a
contrary
one
he
at
once
denounce
as
a
fool
or
a
rogue
.
 
<EOS>
"
never
you
mind
,
Miss
Flora
,
"
he
say
;
"
<EOS>
you
will
find
,
I
dare
say
,
that
all
will
come
right
eventually
.
<EOS>
d
--
<EOS>
n
me
!
<EOS>
the
only
thing
that
provoke
me
in
the
whole
business
be
,
that
I
should
have
be
such
an
old
fool
as
for
a
moment
to
doubt
Charles
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
know
him
better
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
,
my
dear
,
but
I
be
take
by
surprise
,
you
see
,
and
that
be
wrong
,
too
,
for
a
man
who
have
hold
a
responsible
command
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
the
circumstance
,
dear
sir
,
be
of
a
nature
to
take
every
one
by
surprise
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
be
,
they
be
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
candidly
speak
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
I
can
speak
candidly
to
you
;
do
you
really
think
this
Varney
be
the
vampyre
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
?
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
somebody
must
tackle
him
,
that
be
quite
clear
;
we
can
not
put
up
with
his
fancy
always
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
can
be
do
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
that
I
do
not
know
,
but
something
must
be
do
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
He
want
this
place
;
Heaven
only
know
why
or
wherefore
he
have
take
such
a
fancy
to
it
;
but
he
have
do
so
,
that
be
quite
clear
.
<EOS>
if
it
have
a
good
sea
view
,
I
should
not
be
so
much
surprised
;
but
there
be
nothing
of
the
sort
,
so
it
be
no
way
at
all
well
than
any
other
shore
-
go
stupid
sort
of
house
,
that
you
can
see
nothing
but
land
from
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
if
my
brother
would
but
make
some
compromise
with
him
to
restore
Charles
to
us
and
take
the
house
,
we
may
yet
be
happy
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
D
--
<EOS>
n
it
!
<EOS>
then
you
still
think
that
he
have
a
hand
in
spirit
away
Charles
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
who
else
could
do
so
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
hang
if
I
know
.
<EOS>
I
do
feel
tolerably
sure
,
and
I
have
good
deal
of
reliance
upon
your
opinion
,
my
dear
<EOS>
;
I
say
,
I
do
feel
tolerably
sure
:
<EOS>
but
,
if
I
be
d----d
<EOS>
sure
,
now
,
I
would
soon
have
it
out
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
for
my
sake
,
Admiral
Bell
,
I
wish
now
to
extract
one
promise
from
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
say
your
say
,
my
dear

and
I
will
promise
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
then
expose
yourself
to
the
danger
of
any
personal
conflict
with
that
most
dreadful
man
,
whose
power
of
mischief
we
do
not
know
,
and
therefore
can
not
well
meet
or
appreciate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
whew

be
that
what
you
mean

"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
you
will
,
I
be
sure
,
promise
me
so
much
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
my
dear
,
you
see
the
case
be
this
.
<EOS>
in
affair
of
fighting
,
the
less
lady
interfere
the
well
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
why
so
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
because
--
because
,
you
see
,
a
lady
have
no
reputation
for
courage
to
keep
up
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
rather
the
other
way
,
for
we
dislike
a
bold
woman
as
much
as
we
hold
in
contempt
a
cowardly
man
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
if
you
grant
to
us
female
that
in
consequence
of
our
affection
,
we
be
not
courageous
<EOS>
,
you
must
likewise
grant
how
much
we
be
doom
to
suffer
from
the
danger
of
those
whom
we
esteem
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
be
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
esteem
a
coward
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
more
true
courage
often
in
not
fight
than
in
enter
into
a
contest
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
right
enough
there
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
under
ordinary
circumstance
,
I
should
not
oppose
your
carrying
out
the
dictate
of
your
honour
,
but
now
,
let
me
entreat
you
not
to
meet
this
dreadful
man
,
if
man
he
can
be
call
,
when
you
know
not
how
unfair
the
contest
may
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
unfair
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
.
<EOS>
May
he
not
have
some
mean
of
prevent
you
from
injure
him
,
and
of
overcome
you
,
which
no
mortal
possess
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
may
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
the
supposition
of
such
a
case
ought
to
be
sufficient
ground
for
at
once
induce
you
to
abandon
all
idea
of
meet
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
I
will
consider
of
this
matter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
so
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
another
thing
,
however
,
which
now
you
will
permit
me
to
ask
of
you
as
a
favour

"
 
<EOS>

It
be
grant
ere
it
be
speak

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

very
good

now
you
must
not
be
offend
with
what
I
be
go
to
say
,
because
,
however
it
may
touch
that
very
proper
pride
which
you
,
and
such
as
you
,
be
always
sure
to
possess
,
you
be
fortunately
at
all
time
able
to
call
sufficient
judgment
to
your
aid
to
enable
you
to
see
what
be
really
offensive

what
be
not

<EOS>
"
You
alarm
me
by
such
a
preface

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

do
I
?
<EOS>
then
here
go
at
once
.
<EOS>
Your
brother
Henry

poor
fellow

have
enough
to
do
,
have
he
not
,
to
make
all
end
meet
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
a
flush
of
excitement
come
over
Flora
's
cheek
as
the
old
admiral
thus
bluntly
broach
a
subject
of
which
she
already
know
the
bitterness
to
such
a
spirit
as
her
brother
's
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
silent
,
"
continue
the
old
man
;
"
<EOS>
by
that
I
guess
I
be
not
wrong
in
my
I
supposition
;
indeed
it
be
hardly
a
supposition
at
all
,
for
Master
Charles
tell
me
as
much
,
and
no
doubt
he
have
it
from
a
correct
quarter
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
deny
it
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
do
not
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
worth
deny
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
poverty
be
no
crime
,
but
,
like
be
bear
a
Frenchman
,
it
be
a
d----d
misfortune

"
 
<EOS>
Flora
could
scarcely
refuse
a
smile
,
as
the
nationality
of
the
old
admiral
peep
out
even
in
the
midst
of
his
most
liberal
and
good
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
he
continue
,
"
I
do
not
intend
that
he
shall
have
so
much
trouble

he

have

the

then
I
will
soon
make
the
riddle
plain

when
I
go
to
sea
<EOS>
I
be
worth
nothing

as
poor
as

ship

cat
after

crew
have
be
pay
off
for
a
month

<EOS>
well

away

yes

out

do
you
see

at

war
I
find
myself
with
lot

money

all
wrung
from
old
England

enemy

intend
that
some
of
it
shall
find
it

way

your

you
see
that
will
bear
out
just
what
I
say
,
that
the
enemy

his
king

his

shall
free
him
from
his
difficulty

don't
you

your

now
I
have
mention
this
matter
to
you

my

I
do
not
so
much

talk
to
you
about
such
matter

I

to
your

I
want

<EOS>
"
how
,
sir

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

why
,
just
this
way

<EOS>
You
must
find
out
how
much
money
will
free
your
brother
just
now
from
a
parcel
of
botheration
that
beset
him
,
and
then
I
will
give
it
to
you
,
and
you
can
hand
it
to
him
,
you
see
,
so
I
need
not
say
anything
about
it
;
and
if
he
speak
to
me
on
the
subject
at
all
,
I
can
put
him
down
at

there

no
business
of
mine

and
can
you
,
dear
admiral

imagine
that
I
could
conceal
the
generous
source

where
so
much
assistance
come

of

;
it
will
come
from

<EOS>
I
take
a
fancy

you
a

a
sum
of
money

you
do
with

what
you

it

rather
fearfully

wonder
much

no

theme
to
Flora

He
relate
to
her
many
little

all
tend

his

CHAPTER
XXXI
.
 
<EOS>
SIR
FRANCIS
VARNEY
and
his
MYSTERIOUS
visitor.--the
STRANGE
CONFERENCE
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
be
in
what
he
call
his
own
apartment
.
<EOS>
It
be
night
,
and
a
dim
and
uncertain
light
from
a
candle
which
have
be
long
neglect
,
only
serve
to
render
obscurity
more
perplexing
.
<EOS>
the
room
be
a
costly
one
.
<EOS>
one
replete
with
all
the
appliance
of
refinement
and
luxury
which
the
spirit
and
the
genius
of
the
age
could
possibly
supply
him
with
,
but
there
be
upon
his
brow
the
mark
of
corrode
care
,
and
little
do
that
most
mysterious
be
seem
to
care
for
all
the
rich
furnishing
of
that
apartment
in
which
he
sit
.
 
<EOS>
His
cadaverous
-
looking
face
be
even
paler
and
more
death
-
like
-
looking
than
usual
;
and
,
if
it
can
be
conceive
possible
that
such
an
one
can
feel
largely
interested
in
human
affair
,
to
look
at
him
,
we
could
well
suppose
that
some
interest
of
no
common
magnitude
be
at
stake
.
 
<EOS>
occasionally
,
too
,
he
mutter
some
unconnected
word
,
no
doubt
mentally
fill
up
the
gap
,
which
render
the
sentence
incomplete
,
and
be
unconscious
,
perhaps
,
that
he
be
give
audible
utterance
to
any
of
his
dark
and
secret
meditation
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
he
rise
,
and
with
an
anxious
expression
of
countenance
,
he
go
to
the
window
,
and
look
out
into
the
darkness
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
all
be
still
,
and
not
an
object
be
visible
.
<EOS>
It
be
that
pitchy
darkness
without
,
which
,
for
some
hour
,
when
the
moon
be
late
in
lend
her
reflected
beam
,
come
over
the
earth
's
surface
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
near
the
hour
,
"
he
mutter
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
now
very
near
the
hour
;
surely
he
will
come
,
and
yet
I
know
not
why
I
should
fear
him
,
although
I
seem
to
tremble
at
the
thought
of
his
approach
.
<EOS>
He
will
surely
come
.
<EOS>
once
a
year
--
only
once
do
he
visit
me
,
and
then
'
tis
but
to
take
the
price
which
he
have
compel
me
to
pay
for
that
existence
,
which
but
for
him
have
be
long
since
terminate
.
<EOS>
sometimes
I
devoutly
wish
it
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
with
a
shudder
he
return
to
the
seat
he
have
so
recently
leave
,
and
there
for
some
time
he
appear
to
meditate
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
now
,
a
clock
,
which
be
in
the
hall
of
that
mansion
he
have
purchase
,
sound
the
hour
loudly
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
time
have
come
,
"
say
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
"
the
time
have
come
.
<EOS>
He
will
surely
soon
be
here
.
<EOS>
hark
!
hark
!
"
 
<EOS>
slowly
and
distinctly
he
count
the
stroke
of
the
clock
,
and
,
when
they
have
cease
,
he
exclaim
,
with
sudden
surprise--
 
<EOS>
"
eleven
!
<EOS>
but
eleven
!
<EOS>
how
have
I
be
deceive
.
<EOS>
I
think
the
hour
of
midnight
be
at
hand
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
hastily
consult
the
watch
he
wear
,
and
then
he
indeed
find
,
that
whatever
he
have
be
look
forward
to
with
dread
for
some
time
past
,
as
certain
to
ensue
,
at
or
about
twelve
o
clock
,
have
yet
another
hour
in
which
to
prey
upon
his
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
could
I
have
make
so
grievous
an
error
?
<EOS>
"
he
exclaim
.
"
<EOS>
another
hour
of
suspense
and
wonder
as
to
whether
that
man
be
among
the
living
or
the
dead
.
<EOS>
I
have
think
of
raise
my
hand
against
his
life
,
but
some
strange
mysterious
feeling
have
always
staid
me
;
and
I
have
let
him
come
and
go
freely
,
while
an
opportunity
may
well
have
serve
me
to
put
such
a
design
into
execution
.
<EOS>
He
be
old
,
too
--
very
old
,
and
yet
he
keep
death
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
He
look
pale
,
but
far
from
unwell
or
fail
,
when
last
I
see
him
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
a
whole
hour
yet
<EOS>
to
wait
.
<EOS>
I
would
that
this
interview
be
over
.
"
 
<EOS>
that
extremely
well
known
and
popular
disease
call
the
fidget
,
now
begin
,
indeed
,
to
torment
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
sit
--
he
could
not
walk
,
and
,
somehow
or
another
,
he
never
once
seem
to
imagine
that
from
the
wine
cup
he
should
experience
any
relief
,
although
,
upon
a
side
table
,
there
stand
refreshment
of
that
character
.
<EOS>
and
thus
some
more
time
pass
away
,
and
he
strove
to
cheat
it
of
its
weariness
by
thinking
of
a
variety
of
subject
;
but
as
the
fate
would
have
it
,
there
seem
not
one
agreeable
reminiscence
in
the
mind
of
that
most
inexplicable
man
,
and
the
more
he
plunge
into
the
recess
of
memory
the
more
uneasy
,
not
to
say
almost
terrified
,
he
look
and
become
.
<EOS>
a
shuddering
nervousness
come
across
him
,
and
,
for
a
few
moment
,
he
sit
as
if
he
be
upon
the
point
of
fainting
.
<EOS>
by
a
vigorous
effort
,
however
,
he
shake
this
off
,
and
then
place
before
him
the
watch
,
which
now
indicate
about
the
quarter
past
eleven
<EOS>
,
he
strove
with
a
calm
aspect
to
wait
the
coming
of
him
<EOS>
whose
presence
,
when
he
do
come
,
would
really
be
a
great
terror
,
since
the
very
think
beforehand
produce
so
much
hesitation
and
apparent
dismay
.
 
<EOS>
in
order
too
,
if
possible
,
then
to
further
withdraw
himself
from
a
too
painful
consideration
of
those
terror
,
which
in
due
time
the
reader
will
be
acquaint
with
the
cause
of
,
he
take
up
a
book
,
and
plunge
at
random
into
its
content
,
he
amuse
his
mind
for
a
time
with
the
following
brief
narrative:--
 
<EOS>
the
wind
howl
round
the
gable
end
of
Bridport
House
in
sudden
and
furious
gust
,
while
the
inmate
sit
by
the
fire
-
side
,
gaze
in
silence
upon
the
blaze
ember
of
the
huge
fire
that
shed
a
red
and
bright
light
all
over
the
immense
apartment
in
which
they
all
sit
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
ancient
looking
place
,
very
large
,
end
capable
of
contain
a
number
of
guest

<EOS>
several
be

<EOS>
an
aged
couple

<EOS>
They
be
the
owner
of
that
lordly
mansion
,
and
near
them
sit
two
young
maiden
of
surpass
beauty
;
they
be
dissimilar
,
and
yet
there
be
a
slight
likeness
,
but
of
totally
different
complexion
.
 
<EOS>
the
one
have
tress
of
raven
black
;
eyebrow
,
eyelash
,
and

and
proud

look
girl
,
<EOS>
her
complexion
clear
,
with
the
hue
of
health
upon
her
cheek
,
while
a
smile
play
around
her
lip
.
<EOS>
the
glance
of
the
eye
be
sufficient
to
thrill
through
the
whole
soul
.
 
<EOS>
the
other
maiden
be
altogether
different
;
her
complexion
altogether
fairer
--
her
hair
of
sunny
chestnut
,
and
<EOS>
her
beautiful
hazel
eye
be
shade
by
long
brown
eyelash
,
while
a
playful
smile
also
light
up
her
countenance
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
young
of
the
two
.
 
<EOS>
the
attention
of
the
two
young
maiden
have
be
direct
to
the
word
of
the
aged
owner
of
the
house

many
of
the
domestic

servant
sit
down

they
be

idle

but
the
daily
task
do
,
then
the
evening
hour
be
spend
by
the
fire

side

"

aged
domestic
,
"
in
an
awful
manner

I

the
old

there
be
a
long
pause

during

all
gaze
at
the

fire

seemingly
wrapt
in

meditation

<EOS>
Henry
Bradley
,
the
son
of
the
apparently
aged
couple

have
leave
that
day
two
year
,
and
wherefore
<EOS>
have
he
leave
the
home
of
his
childhood
?
<EOS>
wherefore
have
he
,
the
heir
to
large
estate
,
do
this
?
 
<EOS>
He
have
dare
to
love
without
his
father
's
leave
,
and
have
refuse
the
offer
his
father
make
him
of
marry
a
young
lady
whom
he
have
choose
for
him
,
but
whom
he
could
not
love
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
as
much
a
matter
of
surprise
to
the
father
that
the
son
should
refuse
,
as
it
be
to
the
son
that
his
father
should
contemplate
such
a
match
.
 
<EOS>
"
Henry

"

the

"
you

<EOS>

the

,
"
certainly
;
it

high

settle

"
 
<EOS>

indeed
,
I
would
rather
not
go

father

I
have
no
intention

just
yet

<EOS>
I
do
not
desire
to
do
so

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
an
opposition
that
Mr.
Bradley
have
not
expect
from
his
son
,
and
which
his
imperious
temper
could
ill
brook
,
and
with
a
darken
brow
<EOS>
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
much
,
Henry

that
I
trespass

when
I

I
expect

,

this

<EOS>

that
be
why
I

deliberate

it
be
not
unreasonable
that
I
should
have
a

in
the
affair

since
it
may
render
me
miserable

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
a
voice

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
I
say
no
to
the
whole
regulation

"
say
Henry
,
decisively
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
do
so
you
forfeit
my
protection

much
more
favour

but
you
have
better
consider
over
what
you
have
say
.
<EOS>
forget
it

come
with

"
 
<EOS>
"
I

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
not

"
 
<EOS>
"
no

I
can
not

my

be
fully
make
up
upon
that
matter

<EOS>
[

<EOS>
and
so
be
mine

<EOS>
You
either
do
as
I
would
have
you
,
or
you
leave
the
house
,
and
seek
your
own
living
,
and
you
be
a
beggar

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
prefer
be
such
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
than
to
marry
any
young
lady
,

be
unable
to
love
her

that

no

not

"
 
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
;
if
you
act
justly
towards
her
she
ought
to
be
grateful

it
be
all
that
be
requisite
in
the
marriage
state

<EOS>
Gratitude
will
beget
love

love
in

beget
love
in
the
other

"
 
<EOS>

I
will
not

with
you

You

I

you
have
have
more
experience

I
have

and
it
would
be
useless

speak
upon
the
subject

but
of
this
I
can
speak
--
<EOS>
my
own
resolve
--
that
I
will
not
marry
the
lady
in
question
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
son
have
all
the
stern
resolve
of
the
father
,
but
he
have
also
very
good
reason
for
what
he
do
.
<EOS>
He
love
,
and
be
beloved
in
return
;
and
hence
he
would
not
break
his
faith
with
her
whom
he
love
.
 
<EOS>
to
have
explain
this
to
his
father
would
have
be
to
gain
nothing
except
an
accession
of
anger
,
and
he
would
have
make
a
new
demand
upon
his
(
the
son
's
)
obedience
,
by
order
him
to
discard
from
his
bosom
the
image
that
be
there
indelibly
engraven

<EOS>
"
You
will
not
marry
her

I
have
choose

not

It
be
useless
to
disguise
the
fact

<EOS>
You
have
your
free

<EOS>
I
shall
take
no
answer

yes

no

<EOS>
"
then
,
no

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Good

sir

and
now
we
be
stranger

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
with
that
Mr.
Bradley
turn
abruptly
from
his
son
,
and
leave
him
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
time
they
have
any
word
of
difference
together
,
and
it
be
sudden
and
soon
terminate
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
Bradley
be
indignant
at
what
have
happen
;
he
do
not
think
his
father
would
have
act
as
he
have
do
in
this
instance
;
but
he
be
too
much
interested
in
the
fate
of
another
to
hesitate
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
then
come
the
consideration
as
to
what
he
should
do
,
now
that
he
have
arrive
at
such
a
climax
.
 
<EOS>
His
first
thought
turn
to
his
mother
and
sister
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
leave
the
house
without
bid
them
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
He
determine
to
see
his
mother
,
for
his
father
have
leave
the
Hall
upon
a
visit
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bradley
and
Emma
be
alone
when
he
enter
their
apartment
,
and
to
them
he
relate
all
that
have
pass
between
himself
and
father
.
 
<EOS>
They
besought
him
to
stay
,
to
remain
there
,
or
at
least
in
the
neighbourhood
;
but
he
be
resolve
to
quit
the
place
altogether
for
a
time
,
as
he
could
do
nothing
there
,
and
he
may
chance
to
do
something
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
,
they
get
together
all
the
money
and
such
jewel
as
they
could
spare
,
which
in
all
amount
to
a
considerable
sum
;
then
take
an
affectionate
leave
of
his
mother
and
sister
,
Henry
leave
the
Hall
--
not
before
he
have
take
a
long
and
affectionate
farewell
of
one
other
who
live
within
those
wall
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
no
other
than
the
raven
-
eyed
maiden
who
sit
by
the
fire
side
,
and
listen
attentively
to
the
conversation
that
be
go
on
.
<EOS>
She
be
his
love
--
she
,
a
poor
cousin
.
<EOS>
for
her
sake
he
have
brave
all
his
father
's
anger
,
and
attempt
to
seek
his
fortune
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
this
done
,
he
quietly
leave
the
Hall
,
without
give
any
one
any
intimation
of
where
he
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Mr.
Bradley
,
when
he
have
say
so
much
to
his
son
,
be
highly
incensed
at
what
he
deem
his
obstinacy
;
and
he
think
the
threat
hang
over
him
would
have
have
a
good
effect
;
but
he
be
amazed
when
he
discover
that
Henry
have
indeed
leave
the
Hall
,
and
he
know
not
whither
.
 
<EOS>
for
some
time
he
comfort
himself
with
the
assurance
that
he
would
,
he
must
return
,
but
,
alas

<EOS>
he
come
not

and
this
be
the
second
anniversary
of
that
melancholy
day
,
which
no
one
more
repent
of
and
grieve
for

than
do
poor

<EOS>
"
surely

surely

"
 
<EOS>
"
no

no

say
Mrs.
Bradley
;
"
it
be
,
I
fear
,
because
he
have
not

unhappiness

<EOS>
be

do
well

"
well

well

I

I

forgive
all
the

once

"
say
Mr.
Bradley
;
"
such
a
night
as
this
be
a
sufficient
apology
for
the
request
you
make
,
and
an
inducement
to
me
to
grant
it
most
willingly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
thank
,
"
reply
the
stranger
;
"
the
welcome
be
most
seasonable
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
seat
,
sir
;
take
your
seat
by
the
ingle
;
it
be
warm
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
stranger
seat
himself
,
and
seem
lose
in
reflection
,
as
he
gaze
intently
on
the
blazing
log
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
robust
man
,
with
great
whisker
and
beard
,
and
,
to
judge
from
his
outward
habiliment
,
he
be
a
stout
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
you
travel
far
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
appear
to
belong
to
the
army
,
if
I
mistake
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
pause
;
the
stranger
seem
not
inclined
to
speak
of
himself
much
;
but
Mr.
Bradley
continued,--
 
"
have
you
come
from
foreign
service
,
sir
?
<EOS>
I
presume
you
have
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
have
not
be
in
this
country
more
than
six
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
;
shall
we
have
peace
think
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
so
,
and
I
hope
it
may
be
so
,
for
the
sake
of
many
who
desire
to
return
to
their
native
land
,
and
to
those
they
love
best
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Bradley
heave
a
deep
sigh
,
which
be
echo
softly
by
all
present
,
and
the
stranger
look
from
one
to
another
,
with
a
hasty
glance
,
and
then
turn
his
gaze
upon
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
,
sir
,
if
you
have
any
person
whom
you
regard
in
the
army
--
any
relative
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
alas
!
<EOS>
I
have
--
<EOS>
perhaps
,
I
ought
to
say
I
have
a
son
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
,
however
,
where
he
be
go
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
a
runaway
;
I
see
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
<EOS>
;
he
leave
because
there
be
some
family
difference
,
and
now
,
I
would
,
that
he
be
once
more
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
say
the
stranger
,
softly
,
"
difference
and
mistake
will
happen
now
and
then
,
when
least
desire
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
this
moment
,
an
old
hound
who
have
lain
beside
Ellen
Mowbray
,
she
who
wear
the
coal
-
black
tress
,
lift
his
head
at
the
difference
in
sound
that
be
notice
in
the
stranger
's
voice
.
<EOS>
He
get
up
and
slowly
walk
up
to
him
,
and
begin
to
smell
around
him
,
and
,
in
another
moment
,
he
rush
at
him
with
a
cry
of
joy
,
and
begin
to
lick
and
caress
him
in
the
most
extravagant
manner
.
<EOS>
this
be
follow
by
a
cry
of
joy
in
all
present
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
Henry
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Ellen
Mowbray
,
rise
and
rush
into
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Henry
,
and
he
throw
off
the
several
coat
he
have
on
,
as
well
as
the
large
beard
he
wear
to
disguise
himself
.
 
<EOS>
the
meeting
be
a
happy
one
;
there
be
not
a
more
joyful
house
than
that
within
many
mile
around
.
<EOS>
Henry

Sir

at

It

but
five
minute
to
twelve
o'clock

and
he
spring
to
his

even

CHAPTER
XXXII
.
 
<EOS>
the
THOUSAND
pounds.--the
stranger
's
precaution
.
  
<EOS>
[
illustration
]
 
Varney
move
not
now
,
nor
do
he
speak
,
but
,
like
a
statue
,
he
stand
,
with
his
unearthly
looking
eye
rivette
upon
the
door
of
the
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
few
moment
one
of
his
servant
come
,
and
said--
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
a
person
be
here
,
who
say
he
want
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
He
desire
me
to
say
,
that
he
have
ride
far
,
and
that
moment
be
precious
when
the
tide
of
life
be
ebb
fast
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
!
yes
!
"
gasp
Varney
<EOS>
;
"
admit
him
,
I
know
him
!
<EOS>
bring
him
here
?
<EOS>
It
be
--
an
--
old
friend
--
of
mine
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
sink
into
a
chair
,
and
still
he
keep
his
eye
fix
upon
that
door
through
which
his
visitor
must
come
.
<EOS>
surely
some
secret
of
dreadful
moment
must
be
connect
with
him
whom
Sir
Francis
expect
--
dread
--
and
yet
dare
not
refuse
to
see
.
<EOS>
and
now
a
footstep
approach
--
a
slow
and
a
solemn
footstep
--
it
pause
a
moment
at
the
door
of
the
apartment
,
and
then
the
servant
fling
it
open
,
and
a
tall
man
enter
.
<EOS>
He
be
envelop
in
the
fold
of
a
horseman
's
cloak
,
and
there
be
the
clank
of
spur
upon
his
heel
as
he
walk
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Varney
rise
again
,
but
he
say
not
a
word
and
for
a
few
moment
they
stand
opposite
each
other
in
silence
.
<EOS>
the
domestic
have
leave
the
room
,
and
the
door
be
closed
,
so
that
there
be
nothing
to
prevent
them
from
converse
;
and
,
yet
,
silent
they
continue
for
some
minute
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
each
be
most
anxious
that
the
other
should
commence
the
conversation
,
first
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
there
be
nothing
so
very
remarkable
in
the
appearance
of
that
stranger
which
should
entirely
justify
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
in
feel
so
much
alarm
at
his
presence
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
be
a
man
past
the
prime
of
life
;
and
he
look
like
one
who
have
battle
much
with
misfortune
,
and
as
if
time
have
not
pass
so
lightly
over
his
brow
,
but
that
it
have
leave
deep
trace
of
its
progress
.
<EOS>
the
only
thing
positively
bad
about
his
countenance
,
be
to
be
find
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
there
there
be
a
most
ungracious
and
sinister
expression
,
a
kind
of
lurking
and
suspicion
look
,
as
if
he
be
always
resolve
in
his
mind
<EOS>
some
deep
lay
scheme
,
which
may
be
sufficient
to
circumvent
the
whole
of
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
,
probably
,
that
Varney
would
not
speak
first
<EOS>
,
he
let
his
cloak
fall
more
loosely
about
him
,
and
in
a
low
,
deep
tone
,
he
say
,
 
"
I
presume
I
be
expect
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
,
"
say
Varney
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
day
,
and
it
be
the
hour
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
right
.
<EOS>
I
like
to
see
you
so
mindful
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
improve
in
look
since--
"
 
"
hush
--
hush
!
<EOS>
no
more
of
that
;
can
we
not
meet
without
a
dreadful
allusion
to
the
past
!
<EOS>
there
need
nothing
to
remind
me
of
it
;
and
your
presence
here
now
show
that
you
be
not
forgetful
.
<EOS>
speak
not
of
that
fearful
episode
.
<EOS>
let
no
word
combine
to
place
it
in
a
tangible
shape
to
human
understanding
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
,
dare
not
,
hear
you
speak
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
well
,
"
say
the
stranger
;
"
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
let
our
interview
be
brief
.
<EOS>
You
know
my
errand
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
so
fearful
a
drag
upon
limited
mean
,
be
not
likely
to
be
readily
forget
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
you
be
too
ingenious
--
too
full
of
well
lay
scheme
,
and
to
apt
and
ready
in
their
execution
,
to
feel
,
as
any
fearful
drag
,
the
condition
of
our
bargain
.
<EOS>
why
do
you
look
at
me
so
earnestly
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
because
,
"
say
Varney
--
and
he
tremble
as
he
spoke--"because
each
lineament
of
your
countenance
bring
me
back
to
the
recollection
of
the
only
scene
in
life
that
make
me
shudder
,
and
which
I
can
not
think
of
,
even
with
the
indifference
of
contempt
.
<EOS>
I
see
it
all
before
my
mind
's
eye
,
come
in
frightful
panoramic
array
,
those
incident
,
which
even
to
dream
of
,
be
sufficient
to
drive
the
soul
to
madness
;
the
dread
of
this
annual
visit
,
hang
upon
me
like
a
dark
cloud
upon
my
very
heart
;
it
sit
like
some
foul
incubus
,
destroy
its
vitality
and
drag
me
,
from
day
to
day
,
nearer
to
that
tomb
,
from
whence
not
as
before
,
I
can
emerge
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
be
among
the
dead
?
"
say
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
yet
be
mortal
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
repeat
Varney
,
"
yes
,
and
yet
be
mortal
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
I
that
pluck
you
back
to
that
world
,
which
,
to
judge
from
your
appearance
,
have
have
since
that
eventful
period
but
<EOS>
few
charm
for
you
.
<EOS>
by
my
faith
you
look
like--
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
like
what
I
be
,
"
interrupt
Varney
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
subject
that
once
a
year
get
frightfully
renew
between
us
.
<EOS>
for
week
before
your
visit
I
be
haunt
by
frightful
recollection
,
and
it
take
me
many
week
after
you
be
go
,
before
I
can
restore
myself
to
serenity
.
<EOS>
look
at
me
;
be
I
not
an
altered
man
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
in
faith
you
be
,
"
say
the
stranger
"
I
have
no
wish
to
press
upon
you
painful
recollection
.
<EOS>
and
yet
'
tis
strange
to
me
that
upon
such
a
man
as
you
,
the
event
to
which
you
allude
should
produce
so
terrible
an
impression
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
pass
through
the
agony
of
death
,
"
say
Varney
,
"
and
have
again
endure
the
torture
--
for
it
be
such
--
of
the
re
-
union
of
the
body
and
the
soul
;
not
have
endure
so
much
,
not
the
faint
echo
of
such
feeling
can
enter
into
your
imagination
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
may
be
truth
in
that
,
and
yet
,
like
a
flutter
moth
round
a
flame
<EOS>
,
it
seem
to
me
,
that
when
I
do
see
you
,
you
take
a
terrific
kind
of
satisfaction
in
talking
of
the
past
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
strictly
true
,
"
say
Varney
;
"
the
image
with
which
my
mind
be
fill
be
frightful

<EOS>
pen
up
do
they
remain
for
twelve
long
month
.
<EOS>
I
can
speak
to
you
,
and
you
only
,
without
disguise
,
and
thus
do
it
seem
to
me
that
I
get
rid
of
the
uneasy
load
of
horrible
imagining
.
<EOS>
when
you
be
go
,
and
have
be
go
a
sufficient
lapse
of
time
,
my
slumber
be
not
haunt
with
frightful
image
--
I
regain
a
comparative
peace
,
until
the
time
slowly
come
around
again
,
when
we
be
doom
to
meet
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
understand
you

You
seem
well

here

truly

I

make
against
you

no

could
have
more
faithfully
perform
his
bond
than
you
have
.
<EOS>
I
give
you
ample
credit

all
that

long
may
you
live
still

perform
your
condition

I
dare
not

to
keep

faith
I
may
be
compel
to
deceive
a

of
that

Fortune

me

will
not
now

Varney

the
gigantic
and
frightful
penalty
of
disappoint
you

stare
me
in
the
face

<EOS>
I
dare
not
do
so

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
take
from
his
pocket
,
as
he
speak
,
a
clasp
book
,
from
which
he
produce
several
bank
note
,
which
he
place
before
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
thousand
pound
<EOS>
,
"
he
say
;
"
that
be
the
agreement
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
to
the
very
letter
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
return
to
you
a
thousand
thank
--
we
understand
each
other
better
than
to
waste
time
with
idle
compliment
.
<EOS>
indeed
I
will
go
quite
as
far
as
to
say
,
truthfully
,
that
do
not
my
necessity
require
this
amount
from
you
,
you
should
have
the
boon
,
for
which
you
pay
that
price
at
a
much
cheap
rate

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
!
enough
!
"
say
Varney
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
strange
,
that
your
face
should
have
be
the
last
I
see

when
the
world
close
upon

,
and
the
first
that
meet
my
eye

back

do
you
pursue
still
your
dreadful
trade

"
 
<EOS>
"
yes

the
stranger
,
"
for
another
year
,
and
then
,
with
such
a
moderate
competence
as
fortune
have
assign
me
,
I
retire
,
to
make
way
for
young
and
abler
spirit
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
then
,
"

Varney

shall
you
still
require

such
an
amount

"
no

one

liberal

You
be
not
old

no

clog

your
existence

I
have
before

you

the
value

at

you

<EOS>
He
pass
into
an
inner
room
,
and
take
from
a
hook
,
on
which
it
hang
,
a
long
,
dark
-
coloured
cloak
,
he
envelop
his
tall
,
unearthly
figure
within
its
fold
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
he
pass
out
of
his
house
,
and
appear
to
be
take
his
way
towards
Bannerworth
House
.
 
<EOS>
surely
it
must
be
guilt
of
no
common
die
that
could
oppress
a
man
so
destitute
of
human
sympathy
as
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
<EOS>
the
dreadful
suspicion
that
hover
round
him
with
respect
to
what
he
be
,
appear
to
gather
confirmation
from
every
act
of
his
existence

<EOS>
whether
or
not
this
man
,
to
whom
he
feel
bind
to
pay
annually
so
large
a
sum

be
in
the
secret
,
and
know
him
to
be
something
more
than
earthly
,
we
can
not
at
present
declare
;
but
it
would
seem
from
the
tenor
of
their
conversation
as
if
such
be
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
perchance
he
have
save
him
from
the
corruption
of
the
tomb
,
by
place
out
,
on
some
sylvan
spot
,
where
the
cold
moonbeams
fall
,
the
apparently
lifeless
form
,
and
now
claim
so
large
a
reward
for
such
a
service
,
and
the
necessary
secrecy
contingent
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
say
this
may
be
so
,
and
yet
again
some
more
natural
and
rational
explanation
may
unexpectedly
present
itself
;
and
there
may
be
yet
a
dark
page
in
Sir
Francis
Varney
's
life
's
volume
,
which
will
place
him
in
a
light
of
superadded
terror
to
our
reader
.
 
<EOS>
Time
,
and
the
now
rapidly
accumulate
incident
of
our
tale
,
will
soon
tear
aside
the
veil
of
mystery
that
now
envelop
some
of
our
_
dramatis

in

development

Flora
Bannerworth

despairing
gloom
that

around

hope

even
anticipate
that
we
shall
see
her
smile
again
;
that
the
roseate
hue
of
health
will
again
revisit
her
cheek
,
the
light
buoyancy
of
her
step
return
,
and
that
as
before
she
may
be
the
joy
of
all
around
her

dispense
and
receive
happiness

and

too

that
gallant
fearless
lover

no

indulge
a
hope
that

have
a
bright
reward
,
and
that
the
sunshine

felicity

CHAPTER
XXXIII
.
 
<EOS>
the
STRANGE
interview.--the
CHASE
through
the
HALL
.
  
<EOS>
[
illustration
]
 
<EOS>
It
be
with
the
most
melancholy
aspect
that
anything
human
could
well
bear
,
that
Sir
Francis
Varney
take
his
lonely
walk
,
although
perhaps
in
say
so
much
,
probably
we
be
institute
a
comparison
which
circumstance
scarcely
empower
us
to
do
;
for
who
shall
say
that
that
singular
man
,
around
whom
a
very
atmosphere
of
mystery
seem
to
be
perpetually
increase
,
be
human
?
 
<EOS>
Averse
as
we
be
to
believe
in
the
supernatural
,
or
even
to
invest
humanity
with
any
preternatural
power
,
the
more
than
singular
fact
and
circumstance
surround
the
existence
and
the
act
of
that
man
bring
to
the
mind
a
kind
of
shudder
conviction
,
that
if
he
be
indeed
really
mortal
he
still
must
possess
some
power
beyond
ordinary
mortality
,
and
be
walk
the
earth
for
some
unhallowed
purpose
,
such
as
ordinary
man
with
the
ordinary
attribute
of
human
nature
can
scarcely
guess
at
.
 
<EOS>
silently
and
alone
he
take
his
way
through
that
beautiful
tract
of
country
,
comprehend
such
picturesque
charm
of
hill
and
dale
which
lie
between
his
home
and
Bannerworth
Hall
.
<EOS>
He
be
evidently
intent
upon
reach
the
latter
place
by
the
short
possible
route
,
and
in
the
darkness
of
that
night
,
for
the
moon
have
not
yet
rise
,
he
show
no
slight
acquaintance
with
the
intricacy
of
that
locality
,
that
he
be
at
all
enable
to
pursue
so
undeviatingly
a
tract
as
that
which
he
take
.
 
<EOS>
He
mutter
frequently
to
himself
low
,
indistinct
word
as
he
go
,
and
chiefly
do
they
seem
to
have
reference
to
that
strange
interview
he
have
so
recently
have
with
one
who
,
from
some
combination
of
circumstance
scarcely
to
be
guess
at
,
evidently
exercise
a
powerful
control
over
him
,
and
be
enable
to
make
a
demand
upon
his
pecuniary
resource
of
rather
startling
magnitude
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
,
from
a
stray
word
or
two
,
which
be
pronounce
more
distinctly
,
he
do
not
seem
to
be
think
in
anger
over
that
interview
;
but
it
would
appear
that
it
rather
have
recall
to
his
remembrance
circumstance
of
a
painful
and
a
degrade
nature
,
which
time
have
not
be
able
entirely
to
obliterate
from
his
recollection
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
"
he
say
,
as
he
pause
upon
the
margin
of
the
wood
,
to
the
confine
of
which
he
,
or
what
seem
to
be
he
,
have
once
be
chase
by
Marchdale
and
the
Bannerworths--"yes
,
<EOS>
the
very
sight
of
that
man
recall
all
the
frightful
pageantry
of
a
horrible
tragedy
,
which
I
can
never
--
never
forget
.
<EOS>
never
can
it
escape
my
memory
,
as
a
horrible
,
a
terrific
fact
;
but
it
be
the
sight
of
this
man
alone
that
can
recall
all
its
fearful
minutia
to
my
mind
,
and
paint
to
my
imagination
,
in
the
most
vivid
colour
,
every
,
the
least
particular
connect
with
that
time
of
agony
.
<EOS>
these
periodical
visit
much
affect
me
.
<EOS>
for
month
I
dread
them
,
and
for
month
I
be
but
slowly
recover
from
the
shock
they
give
me
.
'
<EOS>
but
once
more
,
'
he
says--'but
once
more
,
'
and
then
we
shall
not
meet
again
.
<EOS>
well
,
well
;
perchance
before
that
time
arrive
,
I
may
be
able
to
possess
myself
of
those
resource
which
will
enable
me
to
forestall
his
visit
,
and
so
at
least
free
myself
from
the
pang
of
expect
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
pause
at
the
margin
of
the
wood
,
and
glance
in
the
direction
of
Bannerworth
Hall
.
<EOS>
by
the
dim
light
which
yet
show
from
out
the
light
sky
,
he
could
discern
the
ancient
gable
end
,
and
turret
-
like
window
;
he
could
see
the
well
lay
out
garden
,
and
the
grove
of
stately
fir
that
shade
it
from
the
northern
blast
,
and
,
as
he
gaze
,
a
strong
emotion
seem
to
come
over
him
,
such
as
no
one
could
have
suppose
would
for
one
moment
have
possess
the
frame
of
one
so
apparently
unconnected
with
all
human
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
this
spot
well
,
"
he
say
,
"
and
my
appearance
here
on
that
eventful
occasion
,
when
the
dread
of
my
approach
induce
a
crime
only
second
to
murder
itself
,
be
on
such
a
night
as
this
,
when
all
be
so
still
and
calm
around
,
and
when
he
who
,
at
the
mere
shadow
of
my
presence
,
rather
choose
to
rush
on
death
than
be
assure
it
be
myself
.
<EOS>
curse
on
the
circumstance
that
so
foil
me
!
<EOS>
I
should
have
be
most
wealthy
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
possess
the
mean
of
command
the
adulation
of
those
who
now
hold
me
but
cheaply
;
but
still
the
time
may
come
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
hope
yet
,
and
that
greatness
which
I
have
ever
pant
for
,
that
magician
-
like
power
over
my
kind
,
which
the
possession
of
ample
mean
alone
can
give
,
may
yet
be
mine
.
"
 
<EOS>
wrap
his
cloak
more
closely
around
him
,
he
stride
forward
with
that
long
,
noiseless
step
which
be
peculiar
to
him
.
<EOS>
mechanically
he
appear
to
avoid
those
obstacle
of
hedge
and
ditch
which
impede
his
pathway
.
<EOS>
surely
he
have
come
that
road
often
,
or
he
would
not
so
easily
have
pursue
his
way
.
<EOS>
and
now
he
stand
by
the
edge
of
a
plantation
which
in
some
measure
protect
from
trespasser
the
more
private
garden
of
the
Hall
,
and
there
he
pause
,
as
if
a
feeling
of
irresolution
have
come
over
him
,
or
it
may
be
,
as
indeed
it
seem
from
his
subsequent
conduct
,
that
he
have
come
without
any
fix
intention
,
or
if
with
a
fix
intention
,
without
any
regular
plan
of
carry
it
into
effect
.
 
<EOS>
do
he
again
dream
of
intrude
into
any
of
the
chamber
of
that
mansion
,
with
the
ghastly
aspect
of
that
terrible
creation
with
which
<EOS>
,
in
the
mind
of
its
inhabitant
,
he
seem
to
be
but
too
closely
identify
?
<EOS>
He
be
pale
,
attenuate
,
and
tremble
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
so
soon
it
have
become
necessary
to
renew
the
life
-
blood
in
his
vein
in
the
awful
manner
which
it
be
suppose
the
vampyre
brood
be
compel
to
protract
their
miserable
existence
?
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
so
,
and
that
he
be
even
now
reflect
upon
how
once
more
he
could
kindle
the
fire
of
madness
in
the
brain
of
that
beautiful
girl
,
who
he
have
already
make
so
irretrievably
wretched
.
 
<EOS>
He
lean
against
an
aged
tree
,
and
his
strange
,
lustrous
-
look
eye
seem
to
collect
every
wander
scintillation
of
light
that
be
around
,
and
to
shine
with
preternatural
intensity
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
,
I
will
,
"
he
say
,
"
be
master
of
Bannerworth
Hall
.
<EOS>
It
must
come
to
that
.
<EOS>
I
have
set
an
existence
upon
its
possession
,
and
I
will
have
it
;
and
then
,
<EOS>
if
with
my
own
hand
I
displace
it
brick
by
brick
and
stone
by
stone
,
I
will
discover
that
hide
secret
which
no
one
but
myself
now
dream
of
.
<EOS>
It
shall
be
do
by
force
or
fraud
,
by
love
or
by
despair
,
I
care
not
which
;
the
end
shall
sanctify
all
mean
.
<EOS>
ay
,
even
if
I
wade
through
blood
to
my
desire
,
I
say
it
shall
be
do
.
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
holy
and
a
still
calmness
about
the
night
much
at
variance
with
the
storm
of
angry
passion
that
appear
to
be
momentarily
gather
power
in
the
breast
of
that
fearful
man
.
<EOS>
not
the
least
sound
come
from
Bannerworth
Hall
,
and
it
be
only
occasionally
that
from
afar
off
on
the
night
air
there
come
the
bark
of
some
watchdog
,
or
the
low
of
distant

all
else
be
mute
save
when
the
deep
sepulchral
tone
of
that
man

if
man
he
be
,
give
an
impulse
to
the
soft
air
around
him

<EOS>
with
a
stroll
movement
as
if
he
be
careless
if
he
proceed
in
that
direction
or
not
,
he
still
go
onward
toward
the
house
,
and
now
he
stand
by
that
little
summer
-
house
once
so
sweet
and
so
dear
a
retreat
,
in
which
the
heart
-
stricken
Flora
have
hold
her
interview
with
him
whom
she
love
with
a
devotion
unknown
to
meaner
mind
.
 
<EOS>
this
spot
scarcely
command
any
view
of
the
house
,
for
so
enclosed
<EOS>
be
it
among
evergreen
and
bloom
flower
,
that
it
seem
like
a
very
wilderness
of
nature
,
upon
which
,
with
liberal
hand
,
she
have
shower
down
in
wild
luxuriance
her
wildest
floral
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
in
and
around
that
spot
the
night
air
be
load
with
sweet
.
<EOS>
the
mingled
perfume
of
many
flower
make
that
place
seem
a
very
paradise
.
<EOS>
but
oh
,
how
sadly
at
variance
with
that
beauty
and
contentedness
of
nature
be
he
who
stand
amidst
such
beauty

<EOS>
all
incapable
as
he
be
of
appreciate
its

or
of
gather
the
faint
moral
from
its
glory

<EOS>
"
why
be
I
here
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
here
,
without
fix
design
or
stability
of
purpose
,
like
some
miser
who
have
hide
his
own

so
deeply
within
the

the
earth
he
can
not
hope
that
he
shall
ever
again
be
able

to
the
light
of

<EOS>
I
hover
around
this
spot
which
I
feel
--
which
I
know
--
contain
my
treasure
,
though
I
can
not
lay
my

upon

in
its
glisten
beauty

"
 
<EOS>
even
as
he
speak
he
cower
down
like
some
guilty
thing
,
for
he
hear
a
faint
footstep
upon
the
garden
path
.
<EOS>
so
light
,
<EOS>
so
fragile
be
the
step
,
that
,
in
the
light
of
day
,
the
very
hum
of
summer
insect
would
have
drown
the
noise
;
but
he
hear
it
,
that
man
of
crime
--
of
unholy
and
awful
impulse
.
<EOS>
He
hear
it
,
and
he
shrink
down
among
the
shrub
and
flower
till
he
be
hide
completely
from
observation
amid
a
world
of
fragrant
essence
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
some
one
stealthily
in
that
place
even
as
he
be
,
unwelcome
or
unknown
?
<EOS>
or
be
it
one
who
have
observe
him
intrude
upon
the
privacy
of
those
now
unhappy
precinct
,
and
who
be
come
to
deal
upon
him
that
death
<EOS>
which
,
vampyre
though
he
may
be
,
he
be
yet
susceptible
of
from
mortal
hand
?
 
<EOS>
the
footstep
advanced
,
and
low
down
he
shrink
until
his
coward
-
heart
beat
against
the
very
earth
itself
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
be
unarmed
,
a
circumstance
rare
with
him
,
and
only
to
be
account
for
by
the
disturbance
of
his
mind
consequent
upon
the
visit
of
that
strange
man
to
his
house
,
whose
presence
have
awaken
so
many
conflicting
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
nearer
and
nearer
still
come
that
light
footstep
,
and
his
deep
-
seat
fear
would
not
let
him
perceive
that
it
be
not
the
step
of
caution
or
of
treachery
,
but
owe
its
lightness
to
the
natural
grace
and
freedom
of
movement
of
its
owner
.
 
<EOS>
the
moon
must
have
arise
,
although
obscure
by
cloud
,
through
which
it
cast
but
a
dim
radiance
,
for
the
night
have
certainly
grow
light
;
so
that
although
there
be
no
strong
shadow
cast
,
a
more
diffused
brightness
be
about
all
thing
,
and
their
outline
look
not
so
dance
,
and
confuse
the
one
with
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
He
strain
his
eye
in
the
direction
<EOS>
whence
the
sound
proceeded
,
and
then
his
fear
for
his
personal
safety
vanish
,
for
he
see
it
be
a
female
form
that
be
slowly
advance
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
first
impulse
be
to
rise
,
<EOS>
for
with
the
transient
glimpse
he
get
of
it
,
he
know
that
it
must
be
Flora
Bannerworth
;
but
a
second
thought
,
probably
one
of
intense
curiosity
to
know
what
could
possibly
have
bring
her
to
such
a
spot
at
such
a
time
,
restrain
him
,
and
he
be
quiet
.
<EOS>
but
if
the
surprise
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
be
great
to
see
Flora
Bannerworth
at
such
a
time
in
such
a
place
,
we
have
no
doubt
,
that
with
the
knowledge
which
our
reader
have
of
her
,
their
astonishment
would
more
than
fully
equal
his
;
and
when
we
come
to
consider
,
that
since
that
eventful
period
when
the
sanctity
of
her
chamber
have
be
so
violate
by
that
fearful
midnight
visitant
,
it
must
appear
somewhat
strange
that
she
could
gather
courage
sufficient
to
wander
forth
alone
at
such
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
have
<EOS>
she
no
dread
of
meeting
that
unearthly
be
?
<EOS>
do
the
possibility
that
she
may
fall
into
his
ruthless
grasp
,
not
come
across
her
mind
with
a
shudder
consciousness
of
its
probability
?
<EOS>
have
she
<EOS>
no
reflection
that
each
step
she
take
,
be
take
her
further
and
further
from
those
who
would
aid
her
in
all
extremity
?
<EOS>
It
would
seem
not
,
for
she
walk
onward
,
unheeding
,
and
apparently
unthinke
of
the
presence
,
possible
or
probable
,
of
that
bane
of
her
existence
.
 
<EOS>
but
let
us
look
at
her
again
.
<EOS>
how
strange
and
spectral
-
like
she
move
along
;
there
seem
no
speculation
in
her
countenance
,
but
with
a
strange
and
glide
step
,
she
walk
like
some
dim
shadow
of
the
past
in
that
ancient
garden
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
pale
,
and
on
her
brow
there
be
the
stamp
of
suffering
;
her
dress
be
a
morning
robe
,
she
hold
it
lightly
round
her
,
and
thus
she
move
forward
towards
that
summer
-
house
which
probably
to
her
be
sanctify
by
have
witness
those
vow
of
pure
affection
,
which
come
from
the
lip
of
Charles
Holland
,
about
whose
fate
there
now
hang
<EOS>
so
great
a
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
have
madness
really
seize
upon
the
brain
of
that
beautiful
girl
?
<EOS>
have
the
strong
intellect
really
sink
beneath
the
oppression
to
which
it
have
be
subject
?
<EOS>
do
she
now
walk
forth
with
a
disorder
intellect
,
the
queen
of
some
fantastic
realm
,
view
the
material
world
with
eye
that
be
not
of
earth
;
shun
perhaps
that
which
she
should
have
seek
,
and
,
perchance
,
in
her
frenzy
,
seek
that
which
in
a
happy
frame
of
mind
she
would
have
shun
.
 
<EOS>
[

<EOS>
such
may
have
be
the
impression
of
any
one
who
have
look
upon
her
for
a
moment
,
and
who
know
the
disastrous
scene
through
which
she
have
so
recently
pass
;
but
we
can
spare
our
reader
the
pang
of
such
a
supposition
.
<EOS>
We
have
bespeak
their
love
for
Flora
Bannerworth
,
and
we
be
certain
that
she
have
it
;
therefore
would
we
spare
them
,
even
for
a
few
brief
moment
,
from
imagine
that
cruel
destiny
have
do
its
bad
,
and
that
the
fine
and
beautiful
spirit
we
have
so
much
commend
have
lose
its
power
of
rational
reflection
.
<EOS>
no
;
thank
Heaven
,
such
be
not
the
case
.
<EOS>
Flora
Bannerworth
be
not
mad
,
but
under
the
strong
influence
of
some
eccentric
dream
,
which
have
picture
to
her
mind
image
which
have
no
home
but
in
the
airy
realm
of
imagination
.
<EOS>
She
have
wander
forth
from
her
chamber
to
that
sacred
spot
where
she
have
meet
him
she
love
,
and
hear
the
noble
declaration
of
truth
and
constancy
that
ever
flow
from
human
lip
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
she
be
sleep
;
but
,
with
a
precision
such
as
the
somnambulist
so
strangely
exert
,
she
tread
the
well
-
know
path
slowly
,
but
surely
,
toward
that
summer
's
bower
,
where
her
dream
have
not
tell
her
lay
crouch
that
most
hideous
spectre
of
her
imagination
,
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
<EOS>
He
who
stand
between
her
and
her
heart
's
good
joy
;
he
who
have
destroy
all
hope
of
happiness
,
and
who
have
convert
her
dear
affection
into
only
so
many
cause
of
great
disquietude
than
the
blessing
they
should
have
be
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
could
she
have
imagine
but
for
one
moment
that
he
be
there
,
with
what
an
eagerness
of
terror
would
she
have
fly
back
again
to
the
shelter
of
those
wall
,
where
at
least
be
to
be
find
some
protection
from
the
fearful
vampyre
's
embrace
,
and
where
she
would
be
within
hail
of
friendly
heart
,
who
would
stand
boldly
between
her
and
every
thought
of
harm
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
know
it
not
,
and
onwards
she
go
until
the
very
hem
of
her
garment
touch
the
face
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
be
terrified
--
he
dare
not
move
--
he
dare
not
speak
!
<EOS>
the
idea
that
she
have
die
,
and
that
this
be
her
spirit
,
come
to
wreak
some
terrible
vengeance
upon
him
,
for
a
time
possess
him
,
and
so
paralysed
with
fear
be
he
,
that
he
could
neither
move
nor
speak
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
well
<EOS>
if
,
during
that
trance
of
indecision
in
which
his
coward
heart
place
him
,
Flora
have
leave
the
place
,
and
again
seek
her
home
;
but
unhappily
such
an
impulse
come
not
over
her
;
she
sit
upon
that
rustic
seat
,
where
she
have
repose
when
Charles
have
clasp
her
to
his
heart
,
and
through
her
very
dream
the
remembrance
of
that
pure
affection
come
across
her
,
and
in
the
tender
and
most
melodious
accent
,
she
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
Charles
!
<EOS>
Charles
!
<EOS>
and
do
you
love
me
still

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
no
;
you
have
not
forsake
me
.
<EOS>
save
me
,
save
me
from
the
vampyre
!

<EOS>
She
shudder
,
and
Sir
Francis
Varney
hear
her
weeping
.
 
<EOS>
"
fool
that
I
be
,
"
he
mutter
,
"
to
be
so
terrified

<EOS>
She
sleep
.
<EOS>
this
be
one
of
the
phase
which
a
disorder
imagination
oft
put
on
.
<EOS>
She
sleep
,
and
perchance
<EOS>
this
may
be
an
opportunity
of
further
increase
the
dread
of
my
visitation
,
which
shall
make
Bannerworth
Hall
far
too
terrible
a
dwelling
-
place
for
her
;
and
<EOS>
well
I
know
,
if
she
go
,
they
will
all
go
.
<EOS>
It
will
become
a
deserted
house
,
and
that
be
what
I
want
.
<EOS>
a
house
,
too
,
with
such
an
evil
reputation
,
that
none
but
myself
,
who
have
create
that
reputation
,
will
venture
within
its
walls:--a
house
,
which
superstition
will
point
out
as
the
abode
of
evil
spirits;--a
house
,
as
it
be
,
by
general
opinion
,
cede
to
the
vampyre
.
<EOS>
yes
,
it
shall
be
my
own
;
fit
dwelling
-
place
for
a
while
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
swear
it
shall
be
mine
,
and
I
will
keep
my
oath
,
little
such
as
I
have
to
do
with
vow

<EOS>
He
rise
,
and
move
slowly
to
the
narrow
entrance
of
the
summer

a
movement
he
could
make

without

there

stand

the
upper
part

his
gaunt

hideous

clearly
define

so
that
if
Flora
Bannerworth
have
not
be
in
that
trance
of
sleep

she
really

one
glance
upward
would

hitherto
sacred

you

Sir
Francis
Varney
now
pause
again
,
and
he
seem
for
a
few
moment
to
gloat
over
the
helpless
condition
of
her
whom
he
have
so
determined
to
make
his
victim
;
there
be
no
look
of
pity
in
his
face
,
no
one
touch
of
human
kindness
could
be
find
in
the
whole
expression
of
those
diabolical
feature
;
and
if
he
delay
make
the
attempt
to
strike
terror
into
the
heart
of
that
unhappy
,
but
beautiful
being
,
it
could
not
be
from
any
relent
feeling
,
but
simply
,
that
he
wish
for
a
few
moment
to
indulge
his
imagination
with
the
idea
of
perfect
his
villany
more
effectually
.
 
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
and
they
who
would
have
fly
to
her
rescue,--they
,
who
for
her
would
have
chance
all
accident
,
ay
,
even
life
itself
,
be
sleep
,
and
know
not
of
the
love
one
's
danger
.
<EOS>
She
be
alone
,
and
far
enough
from
the
house
,
to
be
drive
to
that
totter
verge
where
sanity
end
,
and
the
dream
of
madness
,
with
all

terror

commence
.
 
<EOS>
but
still
she
sleep
--
if
that
half
-
wake
sleep
could
indeed
be
consider
as
any
thing
akin
to
ordinary
slumber
--
still
she
sleep
,
and
call
mournfully
upon
her
lover
's
name
;
and
in
tender
,
beseech
accent
,
that
should
have
melt
even
the
stubborn
heart
,
do
she
express
her
soul
's
conviction
that
he
love
her
still
.
 
<EOS>
the
very
repetition
of
the
name
of
Charles
Holland
seem
to
be
gall
to
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
<EOS>
He
make
a
gesture
of
impatience
,
as
she
again
utter
it
,
and
then
,
step
forward
,
he
stand
within
a
pace
of
where
she
sit
,
and
in
a
fearfully
distinct
voice
<EOS>
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
Flora
Bannerworth
,
awake
!
<EOS>
awake
!
<EOS>
and
look
upon
me
,
although
the
sight
blast
and
drive
you
to
despair
.
<EOS>
awake
!
<EOS>
awake
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
sound
of
the
voice
which
arouse
her
from
that
strange
slumber
.
<EOS>
It
be
say
that
those
who
sleep
in
that
eccentric
manner
,
be
insensible
to
sound
,
but
that
the
light
touch
will
arouse
them
in
an
instant
;
and
so
it
be
in
this
case
,
for
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
as
he
speak
,
<EOS>
lay
upon
the
hand
of
Flora
two
of
his
cold
,
corpse
-
like
looking
finger
.
<EOS>
a
shriek
burst
from
her
lip
,
and
although
the
confusion
of
her
memory
and
conception
be
immense
,
yet
she
be
awake
,
and
the
somnambulistic
trance
have
leave
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
help
,
help
!
"
<EOS>
she
cry
.
"
<EOS>
Gracious
Heavens
!
<EOS>
where
be
I
?
"
 
<EOS>
Varney
speak
not
,
but
he
spread
out
his
long
,
thin
arm
in
such
a
manner
that
he
seem
almost
to
encircle
her
,
while
he
touch
her
not
,
so
that
escape
become
a
matter
of
impossibility
,
and
to
attempt
to
do
so
,
must
have
be
to
have
throw
herself
into
his
hideous
embrace
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
obtain
but
<EOS>
a
single
view
of
the
face
and
figure
of
him
who
oppose
her
progress
,
but
,
slight
as
that
view
be
,
it
more
than
sufficed
.
<EOS>
the
very
extremity
of
fear
come
across
her
,
and
she
sit
like
one
paralysed
;
the
only
evidence
of
existence
she
give
consist
in
the
words,--
 
<EOS>
"
the
vampyre
--
the
vampyre
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Varney
,
"
the
vampyre

<EOS>
You
know
me
,
Flora
Bannerworth

Varney

vampyre
;
your
midnight
guest
at
that
feast
of
blood
.
<EOS>
I
be
the

upon
me
well
;

not
from
my
gaze

<EOS>
You

well
not
to
shun
me
,
but
to
speak
to
me
in
such
a
shape
that
I
may
learn
to
love
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Flora
shake
as
in
a
convulsion
,
and
she
look
as
white
as
any
marble
statue
.
 
<EOS>
"

be
horrible
!
"
<EOS>
she

"

grant
me
the
death

for

persecute

persecute

<EOS>
It

my

persecute
you

there
be
law

visible
creation

force
even
such
a

as
I
be

play
my
part
in
the
great
drama

<EOS>

most
I

It

from

I
would
seek
the
sustenance

never

in

I

soft
sensation

excellence

at

at

I

even
I

now

the

<EOS>
there
be
a
something
in
the
tone
,
a
touch
of
sadness
in
the
manner
,
and
a
deep
sincerity
in
these
word

that
in

measure
disabuse
Flora
of

She
sob
hysterically

a
gush
of
tear
come
to
her
relief

as
,
in
almost
inarticulate
accent

said,--

tell
me
,

Flora

after
a
moment
's
pause
,
during
which
she
appear
to
be
endeavour
to
gather
courage
to
ask
some
fearful
question
;
"
tell
me
if
it

true

those
who
have
once

the
terrific
attack
of
a
vampyre

themselves

one
of
that
dread
race

<EOS>
"
It
be
by
such
mean
,
"

Varney

"
that
the

brood
increase

time

aid
the
development

horrible

!

word
again

yes

safe

not
once

the

sufficient
influence

induce
a
susceptibility

become
coexistent

such
as
he

the
attack

be
often
repeat

termination

the
EXPLANATION.--MARCHDALE
's
advice.--the
PROJECTED
REMOVAL
,
and
the
admiral
's
anger
.
  
<EOS>
[
illustration
]
 
this
extremely
sudden
movement
on
the
part
of
Varney
be
certainly
as
unexpected
as
it
be
decisive
.
<EOS>
Henry
have
imagine
,
that
by
take
possession
of
the
only
entrance
to
the
summer
-
house
,
he
must
come
into
personal
conflict
with
the
being
who
have
work
so
much
evil
for
him
and
his
;
and
that
he
should
so
suddenly
have
create
for
himself
another
mode
of
exit
,
certainly
never
occur
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
Flora
,
"
he
say
,
"
unhand
me
;
this
be
a
time
for
action
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
Henry
,
Henry
,
hear
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
presently
,
presently
,
dear
Flora
;
I
will
yet
make
another
effort
to
arrest
the
headlong
flight
of
Varney
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
shake
her
off
,
perhaps
with
not
more
roughness
than
be
necessary
to
induce
her
to
forego
her
grasp
of
him
,
but
in
a
manner
that
fully
show
he
intend
to
be
free
;
and
then
he
spring
through
the
same
aperture
whence
Varney
have
disappear
,
just
as
George
and
Mr.
Marchdale
arrive
at
the
door
of
the
summer
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
nearly
morning
,
so
that
the
field
be
brighten
up
with
the
faint
radiance
of
the
coming
day
;
and
when
Henry
reach
a
point
which
he
know
command
an
extensive
view
,
he
pause
,
and
run
his
eye
eagerly
along
the
landscape
,
with
a
hope
of
discover
some
trace
of
the
fugitive
.
 
<EOS>
such
,
however
,
be
not
the
case
;
he
see
nothing
,
hear
nothing
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
;
and
then
he
turn
,
and
call
loudly
to
George
to
join
him
,
and
be
immediately
reply
to
by
his
brother
's
presence
,
accompany
by
Marchdale
.
 
<EOS>
before
,
however
,
they
could
exchange
a
word
,
a
rattle
discharge
of
fire
-
arm
take
place
from
one
of
the
window
,
and
they
hear
the
admiral
,
in
a
loud
voice
,
shouting,--
 
<EOS>
"
broadside
to
broadside
!
<EOS>
give
it
them
again
,
Jack
!
<EOS>
hit
them
between
wind
and
water
!
"
 
<EOS>
then
there
be
another
rattling
discharge
,
and
<EOS>
Henry
exclaimed,--
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
meaning
of
that
firing
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
come
from
the
admiral
's
room
,
"
say
Marchdale
.
<EOS>
"
on
my
life
,
I
think
the
old
man
must
be
mad
.
<EOS>
He
have
some
six
or
eight
pistol
range
in
a
row
along
the
window
-
sill
,
and
all
load
,
so
that
by
the
aid
of
a
match
they
can
be
pretty
well
discharge
as
a
volley
,
which
he
consider
the
only
proper
mean
of
fire
upon
the
vampyre
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
so
,
"
reply
George
;
"
and
,
no
doubt
,
hear
an
alarm
,
he
have
commence
operation
by
fire
into
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
"
say
Henry
;
"
he
must
have
his
way
.
<EOS>
I
have
pursue
Varney
thus
far
,
and
that
he
have
again
retreat
to
the
wood
,
I
can
not
doubt
.
<EOS>
between
this
and
the
full
light
of
day
,
let
us
at
least
make
an
effort
to
discover
his
place
of
retreat
.
<EOS>
We
know
the
locality
as
well
as
he
can
possibly
,
and
I
propose
now
that
we
commence
an
active
search
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
come
on
,
then
,
"
say
Marchdale
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
all
armed
;
and
I
,
for
one
,
shall
feel
no
hesitation
in
take
the
life
,
if
it
be
possible
to
do
so
,
of
that
strange
being
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
of
that
possibility
you
doubt
?
"
say
George
,
as
they
hurry
on
across
the
meadow
.
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
do
,
and
with
reason
too
.
<EOS>
I
be
certain
that
when
I
fire
at
him
before
I
hit
him
;
and
besides
,
Flora
must
have
shoot
him
upon
the
occasion
when
we
be
absent
,
and
she
use
your
pistol
Henry
,
to
defend
herself
and
her
mother
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
seem
so
,
"
say
Henry
;
"
and
disregard
all
present
circumstance
,
if
I
do
meet
him
,
I
will
put
to
the
proof
whether
he
be
mortal
or
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
distance
be
not
great
,
and
they
soon
reach
the
margin
of
the
wood
;
they
then
separate
agree
to
meet
within
it
,
at
a
well
-
spring
,
familiar
to
them
all
:
previous
to
which
each
be
to
make
his
good
endeavour
to
discover
if
any
one
be
hide
among
the
bush
-
wood
or
in
the
hollow
of
the
ancient
tree
they
should
encounter
on
their
line
of
march
.
 
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
that
Henry
find
that
he
be
likely
to
pass
an
exceedingly
disturbed
,
restless
night
,
through
agitation
of
spirit
,
have
,
after
toss
to
and
fro
on
his
couch
for
many
hour
,
wisely
at
length
rise
,
and
determine
to
walk
abroad
in
the
garden
belong
to
the
mansion
,
in
preference
to
continue
in
such
a
state
of
fever
and
anxiety
,
as
he
be
in
,
in
his
own
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
since
the
vampyre
's
dreadful
visit
,
it
have
be
the
custom
of
both
the
brother
,
occasionally
,
to
tap
at
the
chamber
door
of
Flora
,
who
,
at
her
own
request
,
now
that
she
have
change
her
room
,
and
dispense
with
any
one
sit
up
with
her
,
wish
occasionally
to
be
communicate
with
by
some
member
of
the
family

<EOS>
Henry
,
then
,
after
rapidly
dress
,
as
he
pass
the
door
of
her
bedroom
,
be
about
to
tap
at
it
,
when
to
his
surprise
he
find
it
open
,
and
upon
hastily
enter
it
he
observe
that
the
bed
be
empty
,
and
a
hasty
glance
round
the
apartment
convince
him
that
Flora
be
not
there
.
 
<EOS>
Alarm
take
possession
of
him
,
and
hastily
arm
himself
,
he
rouse
Marchdale
and
George
,
but
without
wait
for
them
to
be
ready
to
accompany
him
,
he
seek
the
garden
,
to
search
it
thoroughly
in
case
she
should
be
anywhere
there
conceal
.
 
<EOS>
thus
it
be
he
have
come
upon
the
conference
so
strangely
and
so
unexpectedly
hold
between
Varney
and
Flora
in
the
summer
-
house
.
<EOS>
with
what
occur
upon
that
discovery
the
reader
be
acquaint
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
have
promise
George
that
she
would
return
immediately
to
the
house
,
but
when
,
in
compliance
with
the
call
of
Henry
,
George
and
Marchdale
have
leave
her
alone
,
she
feel
so
agitated
and
faint
that
she
begin
to
cling
to
the
trellis
work
of
the
little
building
for
a
few
moment
before
she
could
gather
strength
to
reach
the
mansion
.
 
<EOS>
two
or
three
minute
may
thus
have
elapse
,
and
Flora
be
in
such
a
state
of
mental
bewilderment
with
all
that
have
occur
,
that
she
could
scarce
believe
it
real
,
when
suddenly
a
slight
sound
attract
her
attention
,
and
through
the
gap
which
have
be
make
in
the
wall
of
the
summer
-
house
,
with
an
appearance
of
perfect
composure
,
again
appear
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
 
<EOS>
"
Flora
,
"
he
say
,
quietly
resume
the
discourse
which
have
be
break
off
,
"
I
be
quite
convinced
now
that
you
will
be
much
the
happy
for
the
interview
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Gracious
Heaven
!
"
say
Flora
,
"
whence
have
you
come
from
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
leave
,
"
say
Varney
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
see
you
fly
from
this
spot
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
;
but
it
be
only
to
another
immediately
outside
the
summer
house
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
idea
of
break
off
our
conference
so
abruptly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
have
you
anything
to
add
to
what
you
have
already
state
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
absolutely
nothing
,
<EOS>
unless
you
have
a
question
to
propose
to
me
--
I
should
have
think
you
have
,
Flora
.
<EOS>
be
there
no
other
circumstance
weigh
heavily
upon
your
mind
,
as
well
as
the
dreadful
visitation
I
have
subject
you
to
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Flora
.
<EOS>
"
what
have
become
of
Charles
Holland
?
"
 
"
listen
.
<EOS>
do
not
discard
all
hope
;
when
you
be
far
from
here
you
will
meet
with
him
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
he
have
leave
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
yet
he
will
be
able
,
when
you
again
encounter
him
,
so
far
to
extenuate
his
seeming
perfidy
,
that
you
shall
hold
him
as
untouched
in
honour
as
when
first
he
whisper
to
you
that
he
love
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
joy
!
<EOS>
joy
!
"
<EOS>
say
Flora
;
"
by
that
assurance
you
have
rob
misfortune
of
its
sting
,
and
richly
compensate
me
for
all
that
I
have
suffer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Adieu
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
vampyre
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
now
proceed
to
my
own
home
by
a
different
route
to
that
take
by
those
who
would
kill
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
after
this
,
"
say
Flora
,
"
there
shall
be
no
danger
;
you
shall
be
hold
harmless
,
and
our
departure
from
Bannerworth
Hall
shall
be
so
quick
,
that
you
will
soon
be
release
from
all
apprehension
of
vengeance
from
my
brother
,
and
I
shall
taste
again
of
that
happiness
which
I
think
have
flee
from
me
for
ever
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Farewell
,
"
say
the
vampire
;
and
fold
his
cloak
closely
around
him
,
he
stride
from
the
summer
-
house
,
soon
disappear
from
her
sight
behind
the
shrub
and
ample
vegetation
with
which
that
garden
abound
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
sink
upon
her
knee
,
and
utter
a
brief
,
but
heartfelt
thanksgiving
to
Heaven
for
this
happy
change
in
her
destiny
.
<EOS>
the
hue
of
health
faintly
again
visit
her
cheek
,
and
as
she
now
,
with
a
feeling
of
more
energy
and
strength
than
she
have
be
capable
of
exert
for
many
day
,
walk
towards
the
house
,
she
feel
all
that
delightful
sensation
which
the
mind
experience
when
it
be
shake
off
the
trammel
of
some
serious
evil
which
it
delight
now
to
find
that
the
imagination
have
attire
in
far
bad
colour
than
the
fact
deserve
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
scarcely
necessary
,
after
this
,
to
say
that
the
search
in
the
wood
for
Sir
Francis
Varney
be
an
unproductive
one
,
and
that
the
morning
dawn
upon
the
labour
of
the
brother
and
of
Mr.
Marchdale
,
without
their
have
discover
the
least
indication
of
the
presence
of
Varney
.
<EOS>
again
puzzle
and
confound
,
they
stand
on
the
margin
of
the
wood
,
and
look
sadly
towards
the
brighten
window
of
Bannerworth
Hall
,
which
be
now
reflect
with
a
golden
radiance
the
slant
ray
of
the
morning
sun
.
 
<EOS>
"
Foiled
again
,
"
remark
Henry
,
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
;
"
foil
again
,
and
as
completely
as
before
.
<EOS>
I
declare
that
I
will
fight
this
man
,
let
our
friend
the
admiral
say
what
he
will
against
such
a
measure
I
will
meet
him
in
mortal
combat
;
he
shall
consummate
his
triumph
over
our
whole
family
by
my
death
,
or
I
will
rid
the
world
and
ourselves
of
so
frightful
a
character
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
let
us
hope
,
"
say
Marchdale
,
"
that
some
other
course
may
be
adopt
,
which
shall
put
an
end
to
these
proceeding
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
,

exclaim
Henry

"
be
to
hope
against
all
probability
;
what
other
course
can
be
pursue
?
<EOS>

this
Varney

evidently
mark
us

"
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
would
seem
so
,
"
remark
George
;
"
but
yet
he
shall
find
that
we
will
not
fall
so
easily
;
he
shall
discover
that
if
poor
Flora
's
gentle
spirit
have
be
crush
by
these
frightful
circumstance
,
we
be
of
a
sterner
mould

"
 
<EOS>
"
He

Henry

I
for

will
dedicate
my

will
know
no

be
necessary

my

"

well
spoken

say
Marchdale
;

yet
I
hope
that
circumstance
may
occur
to
prevent
such
a
necessity
of
action
,
and
that
probably
you
will
yet
see
that
it
will
be
wise
and
prudent
to
adopt
a
milder
and
a
safe
course
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
Marchdale
,
you
can
not
feel
as
we
feel
.
<EOS>
You
look
on
more
as
a
spectator
,
sympathise
with
the
affliction
of
either
,
than
feel
the
full
sting
of
those
affliction
yourself

<EOS>
"
do
I
not
feel
acutely
for
you
?
<EOS>
I
be
a
lonely
man
in
the
world
,
and
I
have
teach
myself
now
to
centre
my
affection
in
your
family
;
my
recollection
of
early
year
assist
me
in
so
do
.
<EOS>
believe
me
,
both
of
you
,
that
I
be
no
idle
spectator
of
your
griefs

that
I
share
them
fully

if
I
advise
you
to
be
peaceful
,

to
endeavour
by
the
gentle
mean
possible
to
accomplish
your
aim
,
it
be
not
that
I
would
counsel
you
cowardice
;

have
see
so
much
more
of

either

have
time
or
opportunity
of

I
do
not

so
enthusiastically
upon
matter

,
with
a
cooler

calm
judgment

I
do
not

I
proffer
to
you
my
counsel

<EOS>

We
thank
you
,

say
Henry
;

but
this
be
a
matter
in
which
action
seem
specially
call
for
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
bear
that
a
whole

be
to
be
oppress
by
such
a
fiend
in
human
shape
as
that
Varney

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
let
me
,

Marchdale
,
"
counsel
you
to
submit
to
Flora
's
decision
in

business

She
be
the
great

most
deeply
interested
in

termination

fearful

<EOS>
moreover

honourably

little
shall

let

homeward

I

CHAPTER

<EOS>
the
consultation.--the
DUEL
and
its
result
.
  
<EOS>
[

Independent
of
this
interview
which
Flora
have
have
with
the
much
dread
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
the
circumstance
in
which
she
and
all
who
be
dear
to
her
,
happen
at
that
moment
to
be
place
,
certainly
require
an
amount
of
consideration
,
which
could
not
be
too
soon
bestow
.
 
<EOS>
by
a
combination
of
disagreeable
,
everything
that
could
possibly
occur
to
disturb
the
peace
of
the
family
seem
to
have
take
place
at
once
;
like
Macbeth
's
,
their
trouble
have
truly
come
in
battalion
,
and
now
that
the
serenity
of
their
domestic
position
be
destroy
,
minor
evil
and
annoyance
which
that
very
serenity
have
enable
them
to
hold
at
arm's
-
length
become
gigantic
,
and
add
much
to
their
distress
.
 
<EOS>
the
small
income
,
which
,
when
all
be
happiness
,
health
and
peace
,
be
make
to
constitute
a
comfortable
household
,
be
now
totally
inadequate
to
do
so
--
the
power
to
economise
and
to
make
the
most
of
a
little
,
have
fly
along
with
that
contentedness
of
spirit
which
the
harmony
of
circumstance
alone
could
produce
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
poor
Mrs.
Bannerworth
could
now
,
as
she
have
formerly
do
,
when
her
mind
be
free
from
anxiety
,
attend
to
those
domestic
matter
which
make
up
the
comfort
of
a
family
--
distract
at
the
situation
of
her
daughter
,
and
bewilder
by
the
rapid
succession
of
troublesome
event
which
so
short
a
period
of
time
<EOS>
have
give
birth
to
,
she
fall
into
an
inert
state
of
mind
as
different
as
<EOS>
anything
could
possibly
be
,
from
her
former
active
existence
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
likewise
be
see
how
the
very
domestic
flee
from
Bannerworth
Hall
in
dismay
,
rather
than
remain
beneath
the
same
roof
with
a
family
believe
to
be
subject
to
the
visitation
of
so
awful
a
being
as
a
vampyre
.
 
<EOS>
among
the
class
who
occupy
position
of
servitude
,
certainly
there
may
have
be
find
some
,
who
,
with
feeling
and
understanding
above
such
consideration
,
would
have
cling
sympathetically
to
that
family
in
distress
,
which
they
have
know
under
a
happy
aspect
;
but
it
have
not
be
the
good
fortune
of
the
bannerworth
to
have
such
as
these
about
them
;
hence
selfishness
have
its
way
,
and
they
be
desert
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
likely
,
then
,
that
stranger
would
willingly
accept
service
in
a
family
so
situate
,
without
some
powerful
impulse
in
the
shape
of
a
high
pecuniary
consideration
,
as
be
completely
out
of
the
power
of
the
Bannerworths
to
offer
.
 
<EOS>
thus
be
it
,
then
,
that
most
cruelly
,
at
the
very
time
that
they
have
most
need
of
assistance
and
of
sympathy
,
this
unfortunate
family
almost
become
isolated
from
their
kind
;
and
,
apart
from
every
other
consideration
,
it
would
have
be
almost
impossible
for
them
to
continue
inhabitant
of
the
Hall
,
with
anything
like
comfort
,
or
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
although
the
disappearance
of
Charles
Holland
no
longer
awaken
those
feeling
of
indignation
at
his
supposed
perfidy
which
be
first
produce
by
that
event
;
still
,
view
it
in
which
way
they
may
,
it
be
a
severe
blow
of
fate
,
and
after
it
,
they
one
and
all
find
themselves
still
less
able
to
contend
against
the
sea
of
trouble
that
surround
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
reader
,
too
,
will
not
have
fail
to
remark
that
there
be
about
the
whole
of
the
family
that
pride
of
independence
which
induce
them
to
shrink
from
live
upon
extraneous
aid
;
and
hence
,
although
they
feel
and
feel
truly
,
that
when
Admiral
Bell
,
in
his
frank
manner
,
offer
them
pecuniary
assistance
,
that
it
be
no
idle
compliment
,
yet
with
a
sensitiveness
such
as
they
may
well
be
expect
to
feel
,
they
hold
back
,
and
ask
each
other
what
prospect
there
be
of
emerge
from
such
a
state
of
thing
,
and
if
it
be
justifiable
to
commence
a
life
of
dependence
,
the
end
of
which
be
not
evident
or
tangible
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
,
too
,
the
noble
confidence
of
Flora
in
her
lover
,
and
notwithstanding
that
confidence
have
be
echo
by
her
brother
,
there
would
at
time
obtrude
into
the
mind
of
the
latter
,
a
feeling
of
the
possibility
,
that
after
all
they
may
be
mistake
;
and
Charles
Holland
may
,
from
some
sudden
impulse
,
fancy
his
future
happiness
be
all
at
stake
,
have
withdraw
himself
from
the
Hall
,
and
really
write
the
letter
attribute
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
We
say
this
only
obtrude
itself
occasionally
,
for
all
their
real
feeling
and
aspiration
<EOS>
be
the
other
way
,
although
Mr.
Marchdale
,
they
could
perceive
,
have
his
doubt
,
and
they
could
not
but
confess
that
he
be
more
likely
to
view
the
matter
calmly
and
dispassionately
than
they
.
 
<EOS>
in
fact
,
the
very
hesitation
with
which
he
speak
upon
the
subject
,
convince
them
of
his
doubt
;
for
they
attribute
that
hesitation
to
a
fear
of
give
them
pain
,
or
of
wound
the
prejudice
of
Admiral
Bell
,
with
whom
he
have
already
have
word
so
nearly
approach
to
a
quarrel
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
's
visit
to
Mr.
Chillingworth
be
not
likely
to
be
productive
of
any
result
beyond
those
of
a
conjectural
character
.
<EOS>
all
that
that
gentleman
could
do
be
to
express
a
willingness
to
be
direct
by
them
in
any
way
,
rather
than
suggest
any
course
of
conduct
himself
upon
circumstance
which
he
could
not
be
expect
to
judge
of
as
they
who
be
on
the
spot
,
and
have
witness
their
actual
occurrence
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
we
will
suppose
that
the
reader
be
enable
with
us
to
look
into
one
of
the
principal
room
of
Bannerworth
Hall
.
<EOS>
It
be
evening
,
and
some
candle
be
shed
a
sickly
light
on
the
ample
proportion
of
the
once
handsome
apartment
.
<EOS>
at
solemn
consultation
the
whole
of
the
family
be
assemble
.
<EOS>
as
well
as
the
admiral
,
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
and
Marchdale
,
Jack
Pringle
,
too
,
walk
in
,
by
the
sufferance
of
his
master
,
as
if
he
consider
he
have
a
perfect
right
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
the
occasion
of
the
meeting
have
be
a
communication
which
Flora
have
make
concern
her
most
singular
and
deeply
interesting
interview
with
the
vampyre
.
<EOS>
the
detail
of
this
interview
have
produce
a
deep
effect
upon
the
whole
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
Flora
be
there
,
and
she
look
well
,
calm
,
and
more
collected
than
she
have
do
for
some
day
past
.
 
<EOS>
no
doubt
the
interview
she
have
have
with
Varney
in
the
summer
-
house
in
the
garden
have
dispel
a
host
of
imaginary
terror
with
which
she
have
surround
him
,
although
it
have
confirm
her
fully
that
he
and
he
only
be
the
dreadful
being
who
have
cause
her
so
much
misery
.
 
<EOS>
that
interview
have
tend
to
show
her
that
about
him
there
be
yet
something
human
,
and
that
there
be
not
a
danger
of
her
be
hunt
down
from
place
to
place
by
so
horrible
an
existence
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
feeling
as
this
be
,
of
course
,
a
source
of
deep
consolation
;
and
with
a
firm
voice
,
and
more
of
her
old
spirit
of
cheerfulness
about
her
than
she
have
lately
exhibit
,
she
again
detail
the
particular
of
the
interview
to
all
who
have
assemble
,
conclude
by
saying,--
 
"
<EOS>
and
this
have
give
me
hope
of
happy
day
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
a
delusion
,
it
be
a
happy
one
;
and
now
that
but
a
frightful
veil
of
mystery
still
hang
over
the
fate
of
Charles
Holland
,
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
how
gladly
would
I
bid
adieu
to
this
place
,
and
all
that
have
make
it
terrible
.
<EOS>
I
could
almost
pity
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
rather
than
condemn
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
may
be
true
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
to
a
certain
extent
,
sister
;
but
we
never
can
forget
the
amount
of
misery
he
have
bring
upon
us
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
slight
thing
to
be
force
from
our
old
and
much
-
loved
home
,
even
if
such
proceeding
do
succeed
in
free
us
from
his
persecution
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
my
young
friend
,
"
say
Marchdale
,
"
you
must
recollect
,
that
through
life
it
be
continually
the
lot
of
humanity
to
be
endeavour
to
fly
from
great
evil
to
those
which
do
not
present
themselves
to
the
mind
in
so
bad
an
aspect
.
<EOS>
It
be
something
,
surely
,
to
alleviate
affliction
,
if
we
can
not
entirely
remove
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
"
to
a
considerable
extent
,
but
then
it
take
too
much
for
grant
to
please
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
so
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
certainly
,
to
remove
from
Bannerworth
Hall
be
a
much
less
evil
than
to
remain
at
Bannerworth
Hall
,
and
be
haunt
by
a
vampyre
;
but
then
that
proposition
take
for
grant
that
vampyre
business
,
which
I
will
never
grant
.
<EOS>
I
repeat
,
again
and
again
,
it
be
contrary
to
all
experience
,
to
philosophy
,
and
to
all
the
law
of
ordinary
nature
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
fact
be
stubborn
thing
,
"
say
Marchdale
.
 
<EOS>
"
apparently
,
"
remark
Mr.
Chillingworth
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
;
and
here
we
have
the
fact
of
a
vampyre
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
presume
fact
.
<EOS>
one
swallow
do
not
make
a
summer
,
Mr.
Marchdale
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
waste
of
time
,
"
say
Henry--"of
course
,
the
amount
of
evidence
that
will
suffice
to
bring
conviction
to
one
man
's
mind
will
fail
in
do
so
to
another
.
<EOS>
the
question
be
,
what
be
we
to
do
?
"
 
<EOS>
all
eye
be
turn
upon
Flora
,
as
if
this
question
be
more
particularly
address
to
her
,
and
it
behove
her
,
above
all
other
,
to
answer
it
.
<EOS>
She
do
so
;
and
in
a
firm
,
clear
voice
,
she
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
discover
the
fate
of
Charles
Holland
,
and
then
leave
the
Hall
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
fate
of
Charles
Holland
!
"
say
Marchdale
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
really
,
unless
that
young
gentleman
choose
to
be
communicative
himself
upon
so
interesting
<EOS>
a
subject
<EOS>
,
we
may
be
a
long
while
discover
his
fate
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
it
be
not
a
romantic
view
to
take
of
the
question
,
to
suppose
simply
that
he
write
the
three
letter
find
upon
his
dressing
-
table
,
and
then
decamp
;
but
to
my
mind
,
it
savour
most
wonderfully
of
matter
-
of
-
fact
.
<EOS>
I
now
speak
more
freely
than
I
have
otherwise
do
,
for
I
be
now
upon
the
eve
of
my
departure
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
wish
to
remain
here
,
and
breed
dissension
in
any
family
,

to
run
a
tilt
against
anybody
's
prejudice
.
<EOS>
"
here
he
look
at
Admiral
Bell

<EOS>
"
I
leave
this
house
to
-
night

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
d----d
lubberly
thief

"
say
the
admiral
;
"
the
sooner
you
leave
it
the
well

<EOS>
why
,
you
bad

look
son
of
a
gun

what
do
you
mean

<EOS>
I
think
we
would
have
enough

<EOS>
"
I
fully
expect
this
abuse

Marchdale

<EOS>
"
do
you
expect
that

the
admiral
,
as
he
snatch
up
an
inkstand
,
and
throw
at
Marchdale
,
hit
him
a
hard
knock
on
the
chin
,

bespatter
its

on

give

satisfaction

<EOS>
"
I
really

Mr.

never

Marchdale
;
<EOS>

I
look
upon
this
old
nautical
ruffian

something
between

I
should
chastise
him
upon

I
would
rather

<EOS>
SIR
FRANCIS
<EOS>
VARNEY
's
<EOS>
SEPARATE
opponents.--the
interposition
of
FLORA
.
  
<EOS>
[
illustration
]
 
<EOS>
the
old
admiral
so
completely
overcome
the
family
of
the
Bannerworths
by
his
generosity
and
evident
single
-
mindedness
of
his
behaviour
,
that
although
not
one
,
except
Flora
,
approve
of
his
conduct
towards
Mr.
Marchdale
,
yet
they
could
not
help
like
him
;
and
have
they
be
place
in
a
position
to
choose
which
of
the
two
they
would
have
have
remain
with
them
,
the
admiral
or
Marchdale
,
there
can
be
no
question
they
would
have
make
choice
of
the
former
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
however
,
it
be
not
pleasant
to
find
a
man
like
Marchdale
virtually
drive
from
the
house
,
because
he
presume
to
differ
in
opinion
upon
a
very
doubtful
matter
with
another
of
its
inmate
.
<EOS>
but
as
it
be
the
nature
of
the
Bannerworth
family
always
to
incline
to
the
most
generous
view
of
subject
,
the
frank
,
hearty
confidence
of
the
old
admiral
in
Charles
Holland
please
them
better
than
the
calm
and
serious
doubting
of
Marchdale
.
 
<EOS>
His
ruse
of
hire
the
house
of
them
,
and
pay
the
rent
in
advance
,
for
the
purpose
of
place
ample
fund
in
their
hand
for
any
contingency
,
be
not
the
less
amiable
because
it
be
so
easily
see
through
;
and
they
could
not
make
up
their
mind
to
hurt
the
feeling
of
the
old
man
by
the
rejection
of
his
generous
offer
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
leave
,
this
subject
be
canvass
among
them
,
and
it
be
agree
that
he
should
have
his
own
way
in
the
matter
for
the
present
,
although
they
hope
to
hear
something
from
Marchdale
,
which
should
make
his
departure
appear
less
abrupt
and
uncomfortable
to
the
whole
of
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
during
the
course
of
this
conversation
,
it
be
make
known
to
Flora
with
more
distinctness
than
under
any
other
circumstance
it
would
have
be
,
that
George
Holland
have
be
on
the
eve
of
fight
a
duel
with
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
previous
to
his
mysterious
disappearance
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
become
fully
aware
of
this
fact
,
to
her
mind
it
seem
materially
to
add
to
the
suspicion
previously
to
then
entertain
,
that
foul
mean
have
be
use
in
order
to
put
Charles
out
of
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
"
who
know
,
"
she
say
,
"
that
this
Varney
may
not
shrink
with
the
great
terror
from
a
conflict
with
any
human
being
,
and
feel
one
be
inevitable
with
Charles
Holland
,
unless
interrupt
by
some
vigorous
act
of
his
own
,
he
or
some
myrmidon
of
his
may
have
take
Charles
's
life
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
,
Flora
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
that
he
would
have
venture
upon
so
desperate
an
act
;
I
can
not
well
believe
such
a
thing
possible
.
<EOS>
but
fear
not
;
he
will
find
,
if
he
have
really
commit
any
such
atrocity
,
that
it
will
not
save
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
these
word
of
Henry
,
though
it
make
no
impression
at
the
time
upon
Flora
,
beyond
what
they
carry
upon
their
surface
,
they
really
,
however
,
as
concerned
Henry
himself
,
imply
a
settle
resolution
,
which
he
immediately
set
about
reduce
to
practice
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
conference
break
up
,
night
,
as
it
still
be
,
he
,
without
say
anything
to
any
one
,
take
his
hat
and
cloak
,
and
leave
the
Hall
,
proceed
by
the
near
practicable
route
to
the
residence
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
where
he
arrive
without
any
interruption
of
any
character
.
 
<EOS>
Varney
be
at
first
deny
to
him
,
but
before
he
could
leave
the
house
,
a
servant
come
down
the
great
staircase
,
to
say
it
be
a
mistake
;
and
that
Sir
Francis
be
at
home
,
and
would
be
happy
to
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
usher
into
the
same
apartment
where
Sir
Francis
Varney
have
before
receive
his
visitor
;
and
there
sit
the
now
declare
vampyre
,
look
pale
and
ghastly
by
the
dim
light
which
burn
in
the
apartment
,
and
,
indeed
,
more
like
some
spectre
of
the
tomb
,
than
one
of
the
great
family
of
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
seat
,
sir
,
"
say
Varney
;
"
although
my
eye
have
seldom
the
pleasure
of
behold
you

"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
Francis
Varney

Henry

"
I

not
here

I

without
infringe
too
far

to
inquire
,
to
what
circumstance
I

to
one
,
Sir

have
the
candour
to
admit
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
sir
,
"

Varney
,
coldly
;
"
you
measure
my
candour

probably
,
by
a
standard
of
your
own

in
which
case
I
fear

I
may
be
no
gainer
;

yet
that
may
be
of
itself
a
circumstance
that
should
afford
little
food
for
surprise

proceed
,
sir

so
few

in

you
anything

say
Henry
,
in
marked
accent
;
and
he
gaze
on
Sir
Francis
Varney
with
earnestness
,
that
seem
to
say
not
even
a
look
should
escape
his
observation
.
 
<EOS>
Varney
,
however
,
return
the
gaze
as
steadily

coldly

in

accents,--

must
be
well
aware

surely
you
have
not
come
all
this
way

merely
to
make
such
an
inquiry
;

you

<EOS>
Henry
have
something
of
a
struggle
to
keep
down
the
rise
anger
,
at
these
cool
taunt
of
Varney
;
but
he
succeed
--
and
then
he
said,--

You

I

<EOS>
It
be
for
all

like
a

when
you

go
to
give
him
a
broadside
;

make
grimace
,
throw
dust
in
your
eye

try
to

you
in

"
 
<EOS>

I
should

not

Admiral

<EOS>
I
should
not

and
I
dare
say
you
be
a
man
of
too
much
experience
not
to
perceive
when
you
be

may
I
presume
upon
your

far
as
to
beg
that

will
enlighten
me
upon
the
object

your
visit

"
<EOS>
yes

me
out

him
out

I

<EOS>
"
I
must
,
in
truth
,
admit
they
be
not
;
and
,
moreover
,
they
quite
surprise
even
me

I
have
learn
not

at
almost
anything

"
 
<EOS>

you

up

ye

<EOS>
"
I

Sir

with
a
bland
smile

pass
one
hand
gently
over
the
other
,

show
his
front
tooth
in
a
peculiar
manner

"
<EOS>
but
I
really
can
not
comprehend
all
this
;

I
may
say
,
generally
,
that
Mr.

be
no
acquaintance
of
mine
,
and
I
have
no
sort
of
knowledge
where
he
may
be

that

his

I
be

sorry

see
that
I
have
nothing
else
to
say

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
how
it
be
;
you
have
put
him
out

d----d

shall
not

already

you

quietly
rejoin
Varney
;

anything
more
on
that
head
be
out
of
my
power

though
my
willingness
to
oblige
a
person
of
such
consideration
as
yourself
,
be
very
great
;
but
,
permit
me
to
add
,
this
be
a
very
strange
and
odd
communication
from
one
gentleman
to
another
.
<EOS>
You
have
lose
a
relative
,
who
have
,
very
probably
,
take
some
offence
,
or
some
notion
into
his
head
,
of
which
nobody
but
himself
know
anything
,
and
you
come
to
one
yet
more
unlikely
to
know
anything
of
him
,
than
even
yourself

out

he
quarrel

make

make

you
really
determine
upon

have
give
a

themselves

in
particular
in

nothing

may
turn
up

me

to

you
take

him

I
would
not

watchful

you

turn

that
it

needless

I

when

be
cautious

most

so

will
remain

shall
be
at

there
I
will
see
you

be

be

careful

see
Sir

as
early
as
you

Mr.

immediately
set
about
the
conducting
of
the
affair
thus
confide
to
him
;

that
no
time
may
be
lose
,
he
determine
to
set
out
at
once
for
Sir

's
residence

<EOS>
"
thing
with
regard
to
this
family
seem
to
have
go
on
wild
of
late
,
"
think
Mr.
Chillingworth
;
"
this
may
bring
affair
to
a
conclusion
,
though
I
have
much
rather
they
have
come
to
some
other
.
<EOS>
My
life
for
it
,
there
be
a
juggle
or
a
mystery
somewhere
;
I
will
do
this
,
and
then
we
shall
see
what
will
come
of
it
;
if
this
Sir
Francis
Varney
meet
him
--
and
at
this
moment
I
can
see
no
reason
why
he
should
not
do
so
--
it
will
tend
much
to
deprive
him
of
the
mystery
about
him
;
but
if
,
on
the
other
hand
,
he
refuse
--
<EOS>
but
then
that
be
all
improbable
,
because
he
have
agree
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
fear
,
however
,
that
such
a
man
as
Varney
be
a
dreadful
enemy
to
encounter
--
he
be
cool
and
unruffled
--
and
that
give
him
all
the
advantage
in
such
affair
;
but
Henry
's
nerve
be
not
bad
,
though
shake
by
these
untowards
event
;
but
time
will
show
--
<EOS>
I
would
it
be
all
over

<EOS>
with
these
thought
and
feeling
strangely
intermix

Mr.

the

errand
,

as
there
may
arise
a
controversy
upon
the
point
of
precedence
,
you
have
better
be
both
present
,
as
I
must
arrange
this
matter
myself
upon
due
inquiry

<EOS>

I
do
not
exactly
understand
this
,

Mr.
Chillingworth

do
you

Mr.
Pringle

perhaps
you
can
enlighten
me

It

Jack

"
as
how
you
come
here
upon

errand

I
as

why
we
both
come
about

Sir

<EOS>
"
yes
,

Sir
Francis
;

what
Mr.

be
,
I
believe
correct
to
a
letter

<EOS>
I
have
a
challenge
from
both
your
principal
,
and
be
ready
to
give
you
both
the
satisfaction
you
desire
,
provide
the
first
encounter
will
permit
me
the
honour
of
join
in
the
second

<EOS>
You
,
Mr.
Pringle
,
be
aware
of
the
chance
of
war
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
so
,
"
say
Jack
,
with
a
wink
and
a
nod
of
a
familiar
character
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
see
a
few
of
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
proceed
to
make
the
necessary
agreement
between
you
both

gentleman
?
<EOS>
My
affection
for
the
one
equal
fully
the
good
<EOS>
will
I
bear
the
other

I
can
not
give
a
preference
in
so
delicate
a
matter

"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Chillingworth
look
at
Jack
,
and
Jack
Pringle
look
at
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
and
then
the
former
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
the
admiral

Sir

at

I
too

Jack
Pringle
;
"
we
do
not
want
to
bear
down
an
enemy

<EOS>
Admiral
Bell

not
the
man

do
that
,

if
he

I
be
not
the

this

Mr.
Henry
Bannerworth

Admiral
Bell
must
not
be
disappoint

<EOS>
moreover
,
I
have
accept
the
two
cartel

I
be
ready

willing
to
fight;--one
at
a
time
,
I
presume

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
Francis
,
after
what
you
have
say
,
I
must
take
upon
myself
,
on
the
part
of
Mr.
Henry
Bannerworth
,
to
decline
meeting
you

you
can

affair

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"

Jack
Pringle

that
be
right
enough

<EOS>
I
recollect
very
well
when
Jack
Mizeu
fight
Tom
Foremast
,
they
have
their
second
.
<EOS>
Admiral
Bell
can
not
do
anything

<EOS>
no

no

<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
"
say
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
"
you
see
the
dilemma
I
be
in
.
<EOS>
Your
principal
have
both
challenge
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
ready
to
fight
any
one
,
or
both
of
them
,
as
the
case
may
be
.
<EOS>
distinctly
understand
that
;
because
it
be
a
notion
of
theirs
that
I
will
not
do
so
,
or
that
I
shrink
from
them
;
but
I
be
a
stranger
in
this
neighbourhood
,
and
have
no
one
whom
I
could
call
upon
to
relinquish
so
much
,
as
they
run
the
risk
of
do
by
attend
me
to
the
field
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
your
acquaintance
be
no
friend
,
d----e
!
"
say
Jack
Pringle
,
spit
through
his
tooth
into
the
bar
of
a
beautifully
polished
grate
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
stick
to
anybody
--
the
devil
himself
,
leave
alone
a
vampyre
--
if
so
be
as
how
I
have
be
his
friend
and
drunk
grog
from
the
same
can
.
<EOS>
They
be
a
set
of
lubber
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
be
here
long
enough
to
form
any
such
friendship
,
Mr.
Chillingworth
;
but
can
confidently
rely
upon
your
honour
and
that
of
your
principal
,
and
will
freely
and
fairly
meet
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
Sir
Francis
,
you
forget
the
fact
,
in
transacting
,
myself
for
Mr.
Bannerworth
,
and
this
person
or
Admiral
Bell
<EOS>
,
we
do
match
,
and
have
our
own
character
at
stake
;
nay
more
,
our
life
and
fortune
.
<EOS>
these
may
be
small
;
but
they
be
everything
to
us
.
<EOS>
allow
me
to
say
,
on
my
own
behalf
,
that
I
will
not
permit
my
principal
to
meet
you
unless
you
can
name
a
second
,
as
be
usual
with
gentleman
on
such
occasion

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
regret
,
while
I
declare
to
you
my
entire
willingness
to
meet
you
,
that
I
can
not
comply
through
utter
inability
to
do
so
,
with
your
request
.
<EOS>
let
this
go
forth
to
the
world
as
I
have
state
it
,
and
let
it
be
an
answer
to
any
aspersion
that
may
be
utter
as
to
my
unwillingness
to
fight
.
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
pause
of
some
moment
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Chillingworth
be
resolve
that
,
come
of
it
what
would
,
he
would
not
permit
Henry
to
fight
,
unless
Sir
Francis
Varney
himself
should
appoint
a
friend
,
and
then
they
could
meet
upon
equal
term
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
Pringle
whistle
,
and
spit
,
and
chew
and
turn
his
quid
--
hitch
up
his
trouser
,
and
look
wistfully
from
one
to
the
other
,
as
he
said,--
 
"
<EOS>
so
then
it
be
likely
to
be
no
fight
at
all
,
Sir
Francis
what's
-
o'-name
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
seem
like
it
,
Mr.
Pringle
,
"
reply
Varney
,
with
a
meaning
smile
;
"
unless
you
can
be
more
complaisant
towards
myself
,
and
kind
towards
the
admiral
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
not
exactly
that
,
"
say
Jack
;
"
it
be
a
pity
to
stop
a
good
play
in
the
beginning
,
just
because
some
little
thing
be
wrong
in
the
tackling
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
perhaps
your
skill
and
genius
may
enable
us
to
find
some
medium
course
that
we
may
pursue
with
pleasure

profit
.
<EOS>
what
say
you
,
Mr.

<EOS>

all
I

the
Flying
Dutchman

some
such
odd
out
of

<EOS>

,
as
I
say
,
I
be
not

to
spoil
sport

<EOS>
oh

no

we
be

good

I

Varney

bow
politely

Howsoever

as

shall

Admiral
Bell
?

Varney

lift
his
eyebrow

surprise

what

Charles
Holland

uncle

exclaim
Mr.
Chillingworth

in
accent
of
amazement

<EOS>
"
and
why
not
?
"
say
Jack
,
with
great
gravity
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
pledge
my
word
--
Jack
Pringle
's
word
--
that
Admiral
Bell
shall
be
second
to
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
during
his
scrimmage
with
Mr.

that
will
let
the
matter
go
on
;
there
can
be
no
back
-
out
then
,
eh
?
"
<EOS>
continue
Jack
Pringle
,
with
a
knowing
nod
at
Chillingworth
as
he
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
will
,
I
hope
,
remove
your
scruple

Mr.
Chillingworth

Varney
,
with
a
courteous
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
will
Admiral
Bell
do
this
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
second
say
so
,
and
have
,
I
daresay
,
influence
enough
with
him
to
induce
that
person
to
act
in
conformity
with
his
promise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
in
course
he
will
.
<EOS>
do
you
think
he
would
be
the
man
to
hang
back
?
<EOS>
oh
,
no
;
he
would
be
the
last
to
leave
Jack
Pringle
in
the
lurch
--
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
depend
upon
it
,
Sir
Francis
,
he
will
be
as
sure
to
do
what
I
say
,
as
I
have
say
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
after
that
assurance
,
I
can
not
doubt
it
,
"
say
Sir
Francis
Varney
;
"
this
act
of
kindness
will
,
indeed
,
lay
me
under
a
deep
and
lasting
obligation
to
Admiral
Bell
,
which
I
fear
I
shall
never
be
able
to
pay
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
trouble
yourself
about
that
,
"
say
Jack
Pringle
;
"
the
admiral
will
credit
all
,

you
can
pay
off
old
score
when
his
turn
come
in
the
field

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
forget
,
"
say
Varney
;
"
he
deserve
every
consideration
;
but
now
,
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
I
presume
that
we
may
come
to
some
understanding
respect
this
meeting
,
which
you
be
so
kind
as
to
do
me
the
honour
of
seek

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

I
can
not

its
take
place

<EOS>
I
shall
be
most
happy
to
meet
your
second
in
the
field

will
arrange
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
imagine
that
,
under
the
circumstance
,
that
it
will
be
barely
necessary
to
go
to
that
length
of
ceremony
.
<EOS>
future
interview
can
be
arrange
later
;
name
the
time
and
place
,
and
after
that
we
can
settle
all
the
rest
on
the
ground

<EOS>
"
yes
,

Jack
;
"
it
will
be
time
enough
,
surely
,
to
see
the
admiral
when
we
be
upon
the
ground
.
<EOS>
I
will
warrant
the
old
buffer
be
a
true
brick
as
ever
be
:
there
be
no
flinching
about
him

<EOS>

I
be
satisfied

Varney

I
also

Chillingworth
;

,
understand
,
Sir
Francis

any
default
for
second
make
the
meeting
a
blank

<EOS>

I
will
not
doubt
Mr.

honour
so
much
as
to
believe
it
possible

I
be
d----d

"
if
you
be
not

no

it
be
a
great
pity

the

the
place

<EOS>
"
the
good
place
that
I
can
think
of
be
a
level
meadow
half

way

your
privilege

I
waive
it

be
much
oblige

the
choice

I

You
will
meet
with

<EOS>
good
day

Mr.
Pringle

commend
me
to
the
admiral

service
will
be
of
infinite
value
to
me

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
mention
it

Jack

the
admiral
be
the
man

lend

I
will
pledge
my
word

<EOS>
Jack
Pringle
be
too
,
as
that
he
will
do
what
be
right

give
up
his
turn

Jack
Pringle
make
a
sea
bow

take
his
leave

he
follow
Mr.
Chillingworth

they
both
leave
the
house
together

return
to
Bannerworth
Hall

"
well
,

Mr.
Chillingworth
,

I
be
glad
that
Sir
Francis
Varney
have
get
over
the
difficulty

have
no
second

safe
to
meet

man

It
be
not
the
right
thing

Jack
hitch
up
his
trouser
;

I
be
afeard
as
how
he
would
back
out
,

that
would
be
just
the
wrong
thing

the
admiral

would
go
rave
mad

They
have
get

very
few

I
have
so
much

not

I
not

You

what

Mr.

I

go
through
with

you

I
be
happy

I
do
not

this
be
beside
the
question

<EOS>
what
induce
me
to
make
the
remark
be
this,--had
<EOS>
I
be
at
the
hall
,
you
will
admit
that
Henry

would
have
choose
myself

without

Mr.

well

what
then

<EOS>

why
I

shall
suffer
no

as

you

if
you
go
in
the
character

a
second

you
will
not

excuse

for
all
the
penalty
incur
your
profession
of
a
surgeon
will
not
excuse
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
all
that
,
sir

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
I
propose
be
,
that
you
should
accompany
the
party
to
the
field

in
your

surgeon

permit
me

take
that
of

<EOS>
Mr.
Chillingworth
could
not
but
admit
the
reasonableness
of
this
proposal
,

it
be
agree
they
should
return
to
Bannerworth
Hall
in
company

<EOS>
here
they
arrive
in
a
very
short
time
after

enter
together

now
,
"

Mr.

,
"
I
will
go

bring
our
two

I

go
in

the
admiral
give
a
look
of
some
amazement
at
Mr.

then
he

mutter
to
himself,--

no

hint
about
the
odd
fish
I
send
Jack
to

<EOS>
fill
with
a
dubious
kind
of
belief
which
he
have
about
something
he
have
hear
of
Jack
Pringle

he
enter
the
room

where

meet
Marchdale

all
now

It
seem

me

Marchdale

that
this
affair
have
be
not
indiscretely
conduct

somewhat
unusually

of

then
he
desire

,
of
course
,
I
would
not

this
proposal

the

decidedly

very
unfortunate

very
,

what
I
be
about

this,--mr

of

of
great
service

will
inevitably
have
his
own

consult

most
unquestionably
true

,
to
my
mind

the
good

can
be
propose

you
act

certainly

I
have
to

this

Mr.

in
resign
my

well

certainly

Mr.

undoubtedly
act

he
do
not
relinquish
the
part

escape
a

perform

act

capacity

morrow
morning
in

Sir
Francis
Varney

house

at
seven
o'clock
in
the
morning

"
 
<EOS>
More
conversation
pass
among
them
,
and
it
be
agree
that
they
should
meet
early
the
next
morning
,
and
that
,
of
course
,
the
affair
should
be
keep
a
secret
.
 
<EOS>
marchdale
for
that
night
should
remain
in
the
house
,
and
the
admiral
should
appear
as
if
little
or
nothing
be
the
matter
;
and
he
and
Jack
Pringle
retire
,
to
talk
over
in
private
all
the
arrangement
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
Bannerworth
and
Marchdale
also
retire
,
and
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
after
a
time
,
retire
,
promise
to
be
with
them
in
time
for
the
meeting
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
much
of
that
day
be
spend
by
Henry
Bannerworth
in
his
own
apartment
,
in
write
document
and
letter
of
one
kind
and
another
;
but
at
night
he
have
not
finish
,
for
he
have
be
compel
to
be
about
,
and
in
Flora
's
presence
,
to
prevent
anything
from
be
suspect
.
 
<EOS>
Marchdale
be
much
with
him
,
and
in
secret
examine
the
arm
,
ammunition
,
and
bullet
,
and
see
all
be
right
for
the
next
morning
;
and
when
he
have
do
,
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
now
,
Henry
,
you
must
permit
me
to
insist
that
you
take
some
hour
'
repose
,
else
you
will
scarcely
be
as
you
ought
to
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
good
,
"
say
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
finish
,
and
can
take
your
advice
.
"
 
<EOS>
after
many
thought
and
reflection
,
Henry
Bannerworth
fall
into
a
deep
sleep
,
and
sleep
several
hour
in
calmness
and
quietude
,
and
at
an
early
hour
he
awake
,
and
see
Marchdale
sit
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
it
time
,
Marchdale
?
<EOS>
I
have
not
overslept
myself
,
have
I
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
;
time
enough
--
time
enough
,
"
say
Marchdale
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
let
you
sleep
longer
,
but
I
should
have
awaken
you
in
good
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
now
the
grey
light
of
morning
,
and
Henry
arise
and
begin
to
prepare
for
the
encounter
.
<EOS>
marchdale
stole
to
Admiral
Bell
's
chamber
,
but
he
and
Jack
Pringle
be
ready
.
 
<EOS>
few
word
be
speak
,
and
those
few
be
in
a
whisper
,
and
the
whole
party
leave
the
Hall
in
as
noiseless
a
manner
as
possible
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
mild
morning
,
and
yet
it
be
cold
at
that
time
of
the
morning
,
just
as
day
be
begin
to
dawn
in
the
east
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
however
,
ample
time
to
reach
the
rendezvous
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
curious
party
that
which
be
now
proceed
towards
the
spot
appoint
for
the
duel
,
<EOS>
the
result
of
which
may
have
so
important
an
effect
on
the
interest
of
those
who
be
to
be
engage
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
difficult
for
us
to
analyse
the
different
and
conflicting
emotion
that
fill
the
breast
of
the
various
individual
compose
that
party
--
the
hope
and
fear
--
the
doubt
and
surmise
that
be
give
utterance
to
;
though
we
be
compel
to
acknowledge
that
though
to
Henry
,
the
character
of
the
man
he
be
go
to
meet
in
mortal
fight
be
of
a
most
ambiguous
and
undefined
nature
,
and
though
no
one
could
imagine
the
mean
he
may
be
endow
with
for
protection
against
the
arm
of
man
--
Henry
,
as
we
say
,
stride
firmly
forward
with
unflinche
resolution
.
<EOS>
His
heart
be
set
on
recover
the
happiness
of
his
sister
,
and
he
would
not
falter
.
 
<EOS>
so
far
,
then
,
we
may
consider
that
at
length
proceeding
of
a
hostile
character
be
so
far
clearly
and
fairly
arrange
between
Henry
Bannerworth
and
that
most
mysterious
be
who
certainly
,
from
some
cause
or
another
,
have
betray
no
inclination
to
meet
an
opponent
in
that
manner
which
be
sanction
,
bad
as
it
be
,
by
the
usage
of
society
.
 
<EOS>
but
whether
his
motive
be
one
of
cowardice
or
mercy
,
remain
yet
to
be
see
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
he
fear
himself
receive
some
mortal
injury
,
which
would
at
once
put
a
stop
to
that
preternatural
career
of
existence
which
he
affect
to
shudder
at
,
and
yet
evidently
take
considerable
pain
to
prolong
.
 
<EOS>
upon
the
other
hand
,
it
be
just
possible
that
some
consciousness
of
invulnerability
on
his
own
part
,
or
of
great
power
to
injure
his
antagonist
,
may
be
the
cause
why
he
have
hold
back
so
long
from
fight
the
duel
,
and
place
so
many
obstacle
in
the
way
of
the
usual
necessary
arrangement
incidental
to
such
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
there
would
seem
to
be
no
possible
mean
of
escape
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
must
fight
or
fly
,
for
he
be
surround
by
too
many
opponent
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
he
may
have
appeal
to
the
civil
authority
to
protect
him
,
and
to
sanction
him
in
his
refusal
to
commit
what
undoubtedly
be
a
legal
offence
;
but
then
there
can
not
be
a
question
that
the
whole
of
the
circumstance
would
come
out
,
and
meet
the
public
eye
--
<EOS>
the
result
of
which
would
be
,
his
acquisition
of
a
reputation
as
unenviable
as
it
would
be
universal
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
so
happen
,
that
the
peculiar
position
of
the
Bannerworth
family
keep
their
acquaintance
within
extremely
narrow
limit
,
and
greatly
indispose
them
to
set
themselves
up
as
mark
for
peculiar
observation
.
 
<EOS>
once
hold
,
as
they
have
,
a
proud
position
in
the
county
,
and
be
look
upon
quite
as
magnate
of
the
land
,
they
do
not
now
court
the
pry
eye
of
curiosity
to
look
upon
their
poverty
;
but
rather
with
a
gloomy
melancholy
they
live
apart
,
and
repel
the
advance
of
society
by
a
cold
reserve
,
which
few
could
break
through
.
 
<EOS>
have
this
family
suffer
in
any
noble
cause
,
or
have
the
misfortune
which
have
come
over
them
,
and
rob
their
ancestral
house
of
its
lustre
,
be
an
unavoidable
dispensation
of
providence
,
they
would
have
bear
the
hard
position
with
a
different
aspect
;
but
it
must
be
remember
,
that
to
the
fault
,
the
vice
,
and
the
criminality
of
some
of
their
race
,
be
to
be
attribute
their
present
depressed
state
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
see
during
the
progress
of
our
tale
,
that
its
action
have
be
tolerably
confine
to
Bannerworth
Hall
,
its
adjacent
meadow
,
and
the
seat
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
;
the
only
person
at
any
distance
,
know
anything
of
the
circumstance
,
or
feel
any
interest
in
them
,
be
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
the
surgeon
,
who
,
from
personal
feeling
,
as
well
as
from
professional
habit
,
be
not
likely
to
make
a
family
's
affair
a
subject
of
gossip
.
 
<EOS>
a
change
,
however
,
be
at
hand
--
a
change
of
a
most
startling
and
alarming
character
to
Varney
--
one
which
he
may
expect
,
yet
not
be
well
prepared
for
.
 
<EOS>
this
period
of
serenity
be
to
pass
away
,
and
he
be
to
become
most
alarmingly
popular
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
,
however
,
anticipate
,
but
proceed
at
once
to
detail
as
briefly
as
may
be
the
hostile
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
appear
that
Varney
,
now
that
he
have
once
consent
to
the
definitive
arrangement
of
a
duel
,
shrink
not
in
any
way
from
carry
them
out
,
nor
in
the
slight
attempt
to
retard
arrangement
which
may
be
fatal
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
the
early
morning
be
one
of
those
cloudy
one
so
frequently
occur
in
our
fickle
climate
,
when
the
clever
weather
prophet
would
find
it
difficult
to
predict
what
the
next
hour
may
produce
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
kind
of
dim
gloominess
over
all
object
;
and
as
there
be
no
bright
light
,
there
be
no
deep
shadow
--
the
consequence
of
which
be
a
sureness
of
effect
over
the
landscape
,
that
rob
it
of
many
of
its
usual
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
such
be
the
state
of
thing
when
Marchdale
accompany
Henry
and
Admiral
Bell
from
Bannerworth
Hall
across
the
garden
in
the
direction
of
the
hilly
wood
,
<EOS>
close
to
which
be
the
spot
intend
for
the
scene
of
encounter
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
Pringle
come
on
at
a
lazy
pace
behind
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
and
look
as
unconcerned
as
if
he
have
just
come
out
for
a
morning
's
stroll
,
and
scarcely
know
whether
he
see
what
be
go
on
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
the
curious
contortion
into
which
he
twist
his
countenance
,
and
the
different
odd
-
looking
lump
that
appear
in
it
from
time
to
time
,
may
be
account
for
by
a
quid
of
unusual
size
,
which
he
seem
to
be
masticate
with
a
relish
quite
horrifying
to
one
unused
to
so
barbarous
a
luxury
.
 
<EOS>
the
admiral
have
strictly
enjoin
him
not
to
interfere
on
pain
of
be
consider
a
lubber
and
no
seaman
for
the
remainder
of
his
existence
--
threaten
penalty
which
,
of
course
,
have
their
own
weight
with
Jack
,
and
accordingly
he
come
just
,
to
see
the
row
in
as
quiet
a
way
as
possible
,
perhaps
not
without
a
hope
,
that
something
may
turn
up
in
the
shape
of
a
_
causus
belli
_
,
that
may
justify
him
in
adopt
a
threatening
attitude
towards
somebody
.
 
<EOS>
"
now
,
Master
Henry
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
"
<EOS>
none
of
your
palaver
to
me
as
we
go
along
,
recollect
I
do
not
belong
to
your
party
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
have
stand
friend
to
two
or
three
fellow
in
my
time
;
but
if
anybody
have
say
to
me
,
'
Admiral
Bell
,
the
next
time
you
go
out
on
a
quiet
little
shooting
party
,
it
will
be
as
second
to
a
vampyre
,
'
<EOS>
I
would
have
say
'
you
be
a
liar
'
howsomever
,
d
--
me
,
<EOS>
here
you
go
,
and
what
I
mean
to
say
be
this
,
Mr
Henry
,
that
I
would
second
even
a
Frenchman
rather
than
he
should
not
fight
when
he
be
ask
"
 
"
that
be
liberal
of
you
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
<EOS>
at
all
event
"
 
"
I
believe
you
it
be
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
"
<EOS>
so
mind
<EOS>
if
you
do
not
hit
him
,
I
be
not
a
-
go
to
tell
you
how
--
all
you
have
get
to
do
,
be
to
fire
low
;
but
that
be
no
business
of
mine
.
<EOS>
shiver
my
timber
,
I
ought
not
to
tell
you
,
but
d
--
<EOS>
n
<EOS>
you
,
hit
him
if
you
can
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Admiral
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
I
can
hardly
think
you
be
even
preserve
a
neutrality
in
the
matter
,
put
aside
my
own
partisanship
as
regard
your
own
man

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
hang
him
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
go
to
let
him
creep
out
of
the
thing
on
such
a
shabby
pretence
.
<EOS>
I
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
ought
to
have
go
to
his
house
this
morning
;
only
,
as
I
say
I
never
would
cross
his
threshold
again
,
I
will
not
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
if
he
will
come
,
"
say
Mr
Marchdale
to
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
after
all
,
you
know
he
may
take
to
flight
,
and
shun
an
encounter
which
,
it
be
evident
,
he
have
enter
into
but
tardily
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
<EOS>
and
yet
I
must
own
that
your
supposition
have
several
time
cross
my
mind
.
<EOS>
if
,
however
,
he
do
not
meet
me
,
he
never
can
appear
at
all
in
the
country
,
and
we
should
,
at
least
,
be
rid
of
him
,
and
all
his
troublesome
importunity
concern
the
Hall
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
allow
that
man
,
on
any
account
,
to
cross
the
threshold
of
my
house
,
as
its
tenant
or
its
owner
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
it
be
not
usual
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
"
to
let
one
house
to
two
people
at
once
,
unless
you
seem
quite
to
forget
that
I
have
take
yours
.
<EOS>
I
may
as
well
remind
you
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hurra
"
say
Jack
Pringle
,
at
this
moment
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
with
you
?

who
tell
you
to
hurra

enemy
in

Jack

so
he

by
Jove
!

dodge
about
among
the
tree
.
<EOS>
come
,
now
,
this
vampyre
be
a
decenter
fellow
than
I
think
him
.
<EOS>
He
mean
,
after
all
,
to
let
us
have
a
pop
at
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
have
now
reach
so
close
to
the
spot
,
that
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
who
,
to
all
appearance
,
have
be
wait
,
emerge
from
among
the
tree
,
roll
up
in
his
dismal
-
look
cloak
,
and
,
if
possible
,
look
longer
and
thin
than
ever
he
have
look
before
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
wear
a
singular
cadaverous
looking
aspect
.
<EOS>
His
very
lip
be
white
and
there
be
a
curious
,
pinkish
-
look
circle
round
each
of
his
eye
,
that
impart
to
his
whole
countenance
a
most
uninviting
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
turn
his
eye
from
one
to
the
other
of
those
who
be
advance
towards
him
,
until
he
see
the
admiral
,
upon
which
he
give
such
a
grim
and
horrible
smile
,
that
the
old
man
exclaimed,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Jack
,
you
lubber
,
there
be
a
face
for

how

this

go

have
now
reach
its

have
the

it

Henry

interfere

so
the

be
patch
up

Varney
seem
to
think
,
that
after
the
smile
welcome
he

give

his

he

quite
enough

for
there
he
stand

tall

gaunt
,
and
motionless
,
if
we
may
except
an
occasional
singular
movement
of
the
mouth
,

a
clap
together
of
his
tooth

at

be

the

walk
up

give
him
a

that

defiance

"
 
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
look
after
him
with
a
strange
kind
of
smile
,
as
he
walk
away
to
make
the
necessary
preparation
with
Marchdale
for
the
immediate
commencement
of
the
contest
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
simple
and
brief
.
<EOS>
It
be
agree
that
twelve
pace
should
be
measure
out
,
six
each
way
,
from
a
fix
point
;
one
six
to
be
pace
by
the
admiral
,
and
the
other
by
Marchdale
;
then
they
be
to
draw
lot
,
to
see
at
which
end
of
this
imaginary
line
Varney
be
to
be
place
;
after
this
the
signal
for
firing
be
to
be
one
,
two
,
three
--
fire
!
 
<EOS>
a
few
minute
suffice
to
complete
these
arrangement
;
the
ground
be
measure
in
the
manner
we
have
state
,
and
the
combatant
place
in
their
respective
position
,
Sir
Francis
Varney
occupy
the
same
spot
where
he
have
at
first
stand
,
namely
,
that
near
to
the
little
wood
,
and
to
his
own
residence
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
that
under
such
circumstance
the
brave
and
the
calm
of
mankind
could
fail
to
feel
some
slight
degree
of
tremour
or
uneasiness
;
and
,
although
we
can
fairly
claim
for
Henry
Bannerworth
that
he
be
as
truly
courageous
as
any
right
feel
christian
man
could
wish
to
be
,
yet
when
it
be
possible
that
he
stand
within
,
as
it
be
,
a
hair
's
breadth
of
eternity
,
a
strange
world
of
sensation
and
emotion
find
a
home
in
his
heart
,
and
he
could
not
look
altogether
undaunted
on
that
future
which
may
,
for
all
he
know
to
the
contrary
,
be
so
close
at
hand
,
as
far
as
he
be
concerned
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
he
fear
death
,
but
that
he
look
with
a
decent
gravity
upon
so
grave
a
change
as
that
from
this
world
to
the
next
,
and
hence
be
it
that
his
face
be
pale
,
and
that
he
look
all
the
emotion
which
he
really
feel
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
aspect
and
the
bearing
of
a
brave
but
not
a
reckless
man
;
while
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
on
the
other
hand
,
seem
,
now
that
he
have
fairly
engage
in
the
duel
,
to
look
upon
it
and
its
attendant
circumstance
with
a
kind
of
smirk
satisfaction
,
as
if
he
be
far
more
amused
than
personally
interested
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
certainly
the
more
extraordinary
after
the
manner
in
which
he
have
try
to
evade
the
fight
,
and
,
at
all
event
,
be
quite
a
sufficient
proof
that
cowardice
have
not
be
his
actuating
motive
in
so
do
.
 
<EOS>
the
admiral
,
who
stand
on
a
level
with
him
,
could
not
see
the
sort
of
expression
he
wear
,
or
,
probably
,
he
would
have
be
far
from
well
pleased
;
but
the
other
do
,
and
they
find
something
inexpressibly
disagreeable
in
the
smirking
kind
of
satisfaction
with
which
the
vampyre
seem
to
regard
now
the
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
"
confound
him
,
"
whisper
Marchdale
to
Henry
,
"
one
would
think
he
be
quite
delighted
,
instead
,
as
we
have
imagine
him
,
not
well
pleased
,
at
these
proceeding
;
look
how
he
grin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
no
matter
,
"
say
Henry
;
"
let
him
wear
what
aspect
<EOS>
he
may
,
it
be
the
same
to
me
;
and
,
as
Heaven
be
my
judge
,
I
here
declare
,
if
I
do
not
think
myself
justified
in
so
do
,
I
would
not
raise
my
hand
against
this
man

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
can
be
no
shadow
of
a
doubt
regard
your
justification

<EOS>
have
at
him
,
and
Heaven
protect
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
amen
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
admiral
be
to
give
the
word
to
fire
,
and
now
he
and
Marshal
have
step
sufficiently
on
one
side
to
be
out
of
all
possible
danger
from
any
stray
shot
,
he
commence
repeat
the
signal,--
 
<EOS>
"
be
you
ready
,
gentlemen?--once
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
look
sternly
at
each
other
,
and
each
grasp
his
pistol
.
 
<EOS>
"
twice
!
"
 
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
smile
and
look
around
him
,
as
if
the
affair
be
one
of
the
most
common
-
place
description
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thrice
!
"
 
<EOS>
Varney
seem
to
be
study
the
sky
rather
than
attend
to
the
duel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fire
!
"
say
the
admiral
,
and
one
report
only
strike
upon
the
ear
.
<EOS>
It
be
that
from
Henry
's
pistol
.
 
<EOS>
all
eye
be
turn
upon
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
who
have
evidently
reserve
his
fire
,
for
what
purpose
could
not
be
devise
,
except
a
murderous
one
,
the
taking
of
a
more
steady
aim
at
Henry

<EOS>
Sir
Francis
,
however
,
seem
in
no
hurry
,
but
smile
significantly
,
and
gradually
raise
the
point
of
his
weapon

<EOS>
"
do

hear

Sir
Francis

I
give
it
loud
enough

<EOS>
Henry
look
steadily
at

expect
every
moment
to
feel
his
bullet
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Marchdale
hastily
exclaim
that
this
be
not

to
usage

<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
take
no
notice
,

go
on
elevate
his
weapon
;
when
it
be
perpendicular
to

I

not

I
can
afford

he
say

with
a
smile

You

fire

My
eye

Jack

"
who
have
a
thought
it
;
there
be
a
go
!
<EOS>
Would
not
he
do
for
a
dummy
--
to
lead
a
forlorn
hope
,
or
to
put
among
the
boarder
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
here
,
"
say
Sir
Francis
,
<EOS>
hand
a
bullet
to
Henry
bannerworth--"here
be
the
bullet
you
shoot
at
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
Henry
look
at
it
--
<EOS>
it
be
blacken
by
powder
;
and
then
Marchdale
seize
it
and
try
it
in
the
pistol
,
but
find
the
bullet
fit
Henry
's
weapon
.
 
<EOS>
"
by
heaven
,
it
be
so
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
,
step
back
and
look
at
Varney
from
top
to
toe
in
horror
and
amazement
.
 
<EOS>
"
D----e
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
"
if
I
understand
this
.
<EOS>
why
Jack
Pringle
,
you
dog
,
here
be
a
strange
fish
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
on
,
no

<EOS>
there
be
plenty
on

um
in
some
country

<EOS>
"
 
"
Will
you
insist
upon
another
fire
,
or
may
I
consider
you
satisfied
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
object
,
"
say
Marchdale
.
<EOS>
"
Henry
,
this
affair
must
go
no
further
;
it
would
be
madness
--
bad
than
madness
,
to
fight
upon
such
term
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
say
I
,
"
say
the
admiral
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
have
anything
to
do
with
you
,
Sir
Francis

<EOS>
I
will
not
be
your
second
any
longer
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
bargain
for
such
a
game
as
this
.
<EOS>
You
may
as
well
fight
with
the
man
in
brass
armour
,
at
the
Lord
Mayor
's
show
,
or
the
champion
at
a
coronation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
say
Jack
Pringle
;
"
a
man
may
as
well
fire
at
the
back
of
a
halligator
as
a
wamphigher

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
this
must

"
no

"
say
Henry

wherefore
not

<EOS>

because
I

not

Heaven
forbid
you
should

"
 
<EOS>

I
may
not

quit

"
under
ordinary
circumstance
there
may
be
some
shadow
of
an
excuse
for
your

it

none

<EOS>
You
have
neither

you
can
gain
no

<EOS>

how
be
we
to
decide
this

<EOS>
be
I
consider
absolve
from
the
accusation
under

I
lay
,
of
cowardice
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
with
a
cold
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
as
for
that
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
"
I
should
as
soon
expect
credit
for
fighting
behind
a
wall
,
as
with
a
man
that
I
could
not
hit
any
more
than
the
moon

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Henry
;
let
me
implore
you
to
quit
this
scene
;
it
can
do
no
good
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
this
moment
,
a
noise
,
as
of
human
voice
,
be
hear
at
a
distance
;
this
cause
a
momentary
pause
,
and
,
the
whole
party
stand
still

listen

<EOS>
the
murmur
and
shout
that
now
arise
in
the
distance
be
indistinct
and
confused
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
can
all
this
mean
?
"
say
Marchdale
;
"
there
be
something
very
strange
about
it

<EOS>
I
can
not
imagine
a
cause
for
so
unusual
an
occurrence

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
nor
I
,
"

Sir

look
suspiciously
at
Henry

upon

I
know
neither
what
be
the

the
nature

themselves

"
 
<EOS>
"
then
we
can
easily
see
what
be
the
matter
from
yonder
hillock
,
"

the
admiral

<EOS>
and
there
be
Jack
Pringle

,
he
be
up
there
already

<EOS>
what
be
he
telegraph
about
in
that
manner

I
wonder
?
"
 
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
Jack
Pringle
,
hear
the
riot

have
think
that

he
get
to
the
neighbouring
eminence
he
may
possibly
ascertain
what
it
be
that
be
the
cause

what
he
term
the

row

have
succeed
in
some
degree

<EOS>
there
be
a
number
of
people
of
all
kind
come
out
from
the
village

apparently
armed
,
and
shout
.
<EOS>
Jack
Pringle
hitch
up
his

swear
,
then
take
off
his
hat

begin
to
shout
to
the

as
he
said,--

about

I
can
not

Henry

with

inquire
Sir

<EOS>
"
no

observe
Henry

"
for
,
as
far
I
can
observe

they
strike

indeed

they
appear
armed
with

odd
weapon

observe
Sir

they
mean
an
attack
upon
some
one

off

<EOS>

well

then
,
why
be
so
mutinous

because
you
aggrawate
me

<EOS>
the
cry
of
the
mob
become
more
distinct
as
they
draw
near
to
the
party
,
who
begin
to
evince
some
uneasiness
as
to
their
object
.
 
<EOS>
"
surely
,
"

Marchdale
,
"
Mr.
Chillingworth
have
not

anything

the
duel

take
place

no

no

he
be
to

this
morning

the
admiral

I
understand
he
be
to
be
here
in
his
own
character
of
a
surgeon

yet
I
have
not

him
;
have
any
of
you

<EOS>
"
no

Henry

<EOS>
"
then
here
he
come
in
the
character

conservator
of

public
peace

Varney
,
coldly
;
"
however
,
I
believe
that
his
errand
will
be
useless

I
presume

conclude

"
 
<EOS>
"
down
with

vampyre
!

<EOS>

eh
!

what
be
that

<EOS>
what
do
they
say
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

if
you
will
listen
they
will
tell
you
soon
enough

May
be
they
will

yet
I
would
like
to
know
now

"
 
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
look
significantly
at
Marchdale
,
and
then
wait
with
downcast
eye
for
the
repetition
of
the
word
.
 
<EOS>
"
down
with
the
vampyre
!
"
resound
on
all
side
from
the
people
who
come
rapidly
towards
them

converge
towards
a
centre

<EOS>
"
burn
,
destroy
,
and
kill
the
vampyre

<EOS>
no
vampyre
;
burn
him
out
;
down
with
him
;
kill
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
[

<EOS>
then
come
Mr.
Chillingworth
's
voice
,
who
,
with
much
earnestness
,
endeavour
to
exhort
them
to
moderation
,
and
to
refrain
from
violence
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
become
very
pale
agitate
;
he
immediately
turn
,
and
take
the
least
notice
,
he
make
for
the
wood
,
which
lie
between
him
and
his
own
house
,
leave
the
people
in
the
great
agitation
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Marchdale
be
not
unmoved
at
this
occurrence
,
but
stand
his
ground
with
Henry
Bannerworth
,
the
admiral
,
and
Jack
Pringle
,
until
the
mob
come
very
near
to
them
,
shout
,
and
utter
cry
of
vengeance
,
and
death
of
all
imaginable
kind
that
it
be
possible
to
conceive
,
against
the
unpopular
vampyre
.
 
<EOS>
pende
the
arrival
of
these
infuriate
person
,
we
will
,
in
a
few
word
,
state
how
it
be
that
so
suddenly
a
set
of
circumstance
arise
productive
of
an
amount
of
personal
danger
to
Varney
,
such
as
,
up
to
that
time
,
have
seem
not
at
all
likely
to
occur
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
before
state
there
be
but
one
person
out
of
the
family
of
the
Bannerworths
who
be
able
to
say
anything
of
a
positive
character
concern
the
singular
and
inexplicable
proceeding
at
the
Hall
;
and
that
that
person
be
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
an
individual
not
at
all
likely
to
become
garrulous
upon
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
the
good
of
man
have
their
weakness
,
and
we
much
regret
to
say
that
Mr.
Chillingworth
so
far
in
this
instance
forget
that
admirable
discretion
which
commonly
belong
to
him
,
as
to
be
the
cause
of
the
popular
tumult
which
have
now
readie
such
a
height
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
moment
of
thoughtlessness
and
confidence
,
he
tell
his
wife
.
<EOS>
yes
,
this
really
clever
man
,
from
whom
one
would
not
have
expect
such
a
piece
of
horrible
indiscretion
,
actually
tell
his
wife
all
about
the
vampyre
.
<EOS>
but
such
be
human
nature
;
combine
with
an
amount
of
firmness
and
reasoning
power
,
that
one
would
have
think
to
be
invulnerable
safeguard
,
we
find
some
weakness
which
astonish
all
calculation
.
 
<EOS>
such
be
this
of
Mr.
Chillingworth
's
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
he
caution
the
lady
to
be
secret
,
and
point
to
her
the
danger
of
make
Varney
the
vampyre
a
theme
for
gossip
;
but
he
may
as
well
have
whisper
to
a
hurricane
to
be
so
good
as
not
to
go
on
blow
so
,
as
request
Mrs.
Chillingworth
to
keep
a
secret
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
she
burst
into
the
usual
fervent
declaration
of
"
who
be
she
to
tell

not

in

and
then
,
when
Mr.

go
out
,
like
the
King
of
Otaheite
,
she
invite
the
neighbour
round
about
to
come
to
take
some

<EOS>
under
solemn
promise

sixteen
lady
that
evening
be
make
acquaint
with
the
full
and
interesting
particular
of
the
attack
of
the
vampyre
on
Flora
Bannerworth
,
and
all
the
evidence
inculpate
Sir
Francis
Varney
as
the
blood
-
thirsty
individual
.

when
the
mind
come
to
consider
that
these
sixteen
lady
multiply
their
information
by
about
four
-
and
-
twenty
each
,
we
become
quite
lose
in
a
sea
of
arithmetic
,
and
feel
compel
to
sum
up
the
whole
by
a
candid
assumption
that
in
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
not
an
individual
in
the
whole
town
be
ignorant
of
the
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
morning
before
the

duel

there
be
an
unusual
commotion
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
People
be
converse
together
in
little
knot
,
and
use
rather
violent
gesticulation
.
<EOS>
poor
Mr.
Chillingworth
!
<EOS>
he
alone
be
ignorant
of
the
cause
of
the
popular
commotion
,
and
so
he
go
to
bed
wonder
that
an
unusual
bustle
pervade
the
little
market
town
,
but
not
at
all
guess
its
origin
.
 
<EOS>
somehow
or
another
,
however
,
the
populace
,
who
have
determine
to
make
a
demonstration
on
the
follow
morning
against
the
vampyre
,
think
it
highly
necessary
first
to
pay
some
sort
of
compliment
to
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
and
,
accordingly
,
at
an
early
hour
,
a
great
mob
assemble
outside
his
house
,
and
give
three
terrific
applauding
shout
,
which
rouse
him
most
unpleasantly
from
his
sleep
;
and
induce
the
great
astonishment
at
the
cause
of
such
a
tumult
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
that
artful
Mrs.
Chillingworth
!
<EOS>
too
well
she
know
what
be
the
matter
;
yet
she
pretend
to
be
so
oblivious
upon

"
good

cry
Mr.

up

Mr.

accelerate
by
two

three
supplementary

then
,
in
a
temporary
lull

a
loud
voice
shouted,--

<EOS>
the
truth
in

I

you
must

"
 
<EOS>
"
who

do
you

<EOS>
"
who
should
I

"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Chillingworth
be
dress
,
and
he
hasten
down
and
enter
the
street
with
great
desperation
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
hope
that
he
may
be
enable
to
disperse
the
crowd
,
and
yet
be
in
time
to
keep
his
appointment
at
the
duel
.
 
<EOS>
His
appearance
be
hail
with
another
shout
,
for
it
be
consider
,
of
course
,
that
he
have
come
to
join
in
the
attack
upon
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
<EOS>
He
find
assemble
a
much
more
considerable
mob
than
he
have
imagine

and
to
his
alarm
he
find
many
arm
with
all
sort
of
weapon

<EOS>
"
Hurrah

cry
a

half
mad

<EOS>
let
me
implore
you
all
to
return
to
your

,
or
you
will
get
into
serious
trouble
on
this
subject
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
piece
of
advice
not
at
all
likely
to
be
adopt
;
and
when
the
mob
find
that
Mr.
Chillingworth
be
not
dispose
to
encourage
and
countenance
it
in
its
violence
,
it
give
another
loud
shout
of
defiance
,
and
move
off
through
the
long
straggle
street
of
the
town
in
a
direction
towards
Sir
Francis
Varney
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
what
be
call
the
authority
of
the
town
have
become
alarm
,
and
be
stir
,
but
they
find
themselves
in
such
a
frightful
minority
,
that
it
become
out
of
the
question
for
them
to
interfere
with
any
effect
to
stop
the
lawless
proceeding
of
the
rioter
,
so
that
the
infuriate
populace
have
it
all
their
own
way
,
and
in
a
straggle
,
disorderly
-
looking
kind
of
procession
they
move
off
,
vow
vengeance
as
they
go
against
Varney
the
vampyre
.
 
<EOS>
Hopeless
as
Mr.
Chillingworth
think
it
be
to
interfere
with
any
degree
of
effect
in
the
proceeding
of
the
mob
,
he
still
could
not
reconcile
it
to
himself
to
be
absent
from
a
scene
which
he
now
feel
certain
have
be
produce
by
his
own
imprudence
,
so
he
go
on
with
the
crowd
,
endeavour
,
as
he
do
so
,
by
every
argument
that
could
be
suggest
to
him
to
induce
them
to
abstain
from
the
act
of
violence
they
contemplate
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
hope
,
too
,
that
when
they
reach
Sir
Francis
Varney
's
,
find
him
not
within
,
as
probably
would
be
the
case
,
as
by
that
time
he
would
have
start
to
meet
Henry
Bannerworth
on
the
ground
,
to
fight
the
duel
,
he
may
induce
the
mob
to
return
and
forego
their
meditate
violence
.
 
<EOS>
and
thus
be
it
that
,
urge
on
by
a
multitude
of
person
,
the
unhappy
surgeon
be
expiate
,
both
in
mind
and
person
,
the
serious
mistake
he
have
commit
in
trust
a
secret
to
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
let
it
not
be
suppose
that
we
for
one
moment
wish
to
lay
down
a
general
principle
as
regard
the
confide
secret
to
lady
,
because
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
it
have
become
notorious
how
well
they
keep
them
,
and
with
what
admirable
discretion
,
tact
,
and
forethought
this
fair
portion
of
humanity
conduct
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
how
few
Mrs.
Chillingworths
there
be
in
the
world
,
and
have
but
to
regret
that
our

such
a

such
,
then
,
be
the
circumstance
which
at
once
alter
the
whole
aspect
of
the
affair
,
and
,
from
private
and
domestic
cause
of
very
deep
annoyance
,
lead
to
public
result
of
a
character
which
seem
likely
to
involve
the
whole
country
-
side
in
the
great
possible
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
but
while
we
blame
Mr.
Chillingworth
for
be
so
indiscreet
as
to
communicate
the
secret
of
such
a
person
as
Varney
the
vampyre
to
his
wife
,
we
trust
in
a
short
time
to
be
enable
to
show
that
he
make
as
much
reparation
as
it
be
possible
to
make
for
the
mischief
he
have
unintentionally
commit
.
<EOS>
and
now
as
he
struggle
onward
--
apparently
onward
--
first
and
foremost
among
the
rioter
,
he
be
really
do
all
in
his
power
to
quell
that
tumult
which
superstition
and
dread
have
raise
.
 
<EOS>
human
nature
truly
delight
in
the
marvellous
,
and
in
proportion
as
a
knowledge
of
the
natural
phenomenon
of
nature
be
restrict
,
and
unbridled
imagination
allow
to
give
the
rein
to
fathomless
conjecture
,
we
shall
find
an
eagerness
likewise
to
believe
the
marvellous
to
be
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
that
dim
and
uncertain
condition
concern
vampyre
,
originate
probably
as
it
have
do
in
Germany
,
have
spread
itself
slowly
,
but
insidiously
,
throughout
the
whole
of
the
civilized
world
.
 
<EOS>
in
no
country
and
in
no
clime
be
there
not
something
which
bear
a
kind
of
family
relationship
to
the
veritable
vampyre
of
which
Sir
Francis
Varney
appear
to
be
so
choice
a
speciman
.
 
<EOS>
the
_
ghoul
_
of
eastern
nation
be
but
the
same
being
,
alter
to
suit
habit
and
locality
;
and
the
_
sema
_
of
the
Scandinavians
be
but
the
vampyre
of
a
more
primitive
race
,
and
a
personification
of
that
morbid
imagination
which
have
once
fancy
the
probability
of
the
dead
walk
again
among
the
living
,
with
all
the
frightful
insignia
of
corruption
and
the
grave
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
although
not
popular
in
England
,
still
there
have
be
tale
tell
of
such
midnight
visitant
,
so
that
Mrs.
Chillingworth
,
when
she
have
impart
the
information
which
she
have
obtain
,
have
already
some
rough
material
to
work
upon
in
the
mind
of
her
auditor
,
and
therefore
there
be
no
great
difficulty
in
very
soon
establish
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
under
such
circumstance
,
ignorant
people
always
do
what
they
have
hear
have
be
do
by
some
one
else
before
them
and
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
the
propriety
of
catch
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
deprive
him
of
his
vampyre
-
like
existence
,
and
drive
a
stake
through
his
body
,
become
not
at
all
a
questionable
proposition
.
 
<EOS>
alas
,
poor
Mr.
Chillingworth
!
<EOS>
as
well
may
he
have
attempt
King
Canute
's
task
of
stem
the
wave
of
the
ocean
as
that
of
attempt
to
stop
the
crowd
from
proceed
to
Sir
Francis
Varney
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
His
very
presence
be
a
sort
of
confirmation
of
the
whole
affair
.
<EOS>
in
vain
he
gesticulate
,
in
vain
he
beg
and
pray
that
they
would
go
back
,
and
in
vain
he
declare
that
full
and
ample
justice
should
be
do
upon
the
vampyre
,
provide
popular
clamour
spare
him
,
and
he
be
leave
to
more
deliberate
judgment
.
 
<EOS>
those
who
be
foremost
in
the
throng
pay
no
attention
to
these
remonstrance
while
those
who
be
more
distant
hear
them
not
,
and
,
for
all
they
know
,
he
may
be
urge
the
crowd
on
to
violence
,
instead
of
deprecate
it
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
then
,
this
disorderly
rabble
soon
reach
the
house
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
and
loudly
demand
of
his
terrified
servant
where
he
be
to
be
find
.
 
<EOS>
the
knocking
at
the
Hall
door
be
prodigious
,
and
,
with
a
laudable
desire
,
doubtless
,
of
save
time
,
the

one
be
do
amuse
himself
with
the
ponderous
knocker
,
another
seize
it
;
so
that
until
the

be
fling
open
by
some
of
the
bewilder
and
terrified
man
,
there
be
no
cessation
whatever
of
the
furious
demand
for
admittance
.

out

<EOS>
Varney

"
 
<EOS>
the
servant
be
too
terrified
to
speak
for
some
moment
,
as
they
see
such
a
tumultuous
assemblage
seek
their
master
,
while
so
singular
a
name
be
apply
to
him
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
one
more
bold
than
the
rest
contrive
to
stammer
out,--
 
<EOS>
"
My
good
people
,
Sir
Francis
Varney
be
not
at
home
.
<EOS>
He
take
an
early
breakfast
,
and
have
be
out
nearly
an
hour
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
mob
pause
a
moment
in
indecision
,
and
then
one
of
the
foremost
cried,--
 
<EOS>
"
who
'd
suppose
they
would
own
he
be
at
home
?
<EOS>
He
be
hide
somewhere
of
course
;
let
's
pull
him
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
pull
him
out
--
pull
him
out
!
"
<EOS>
cry
many
voice
.
<EOS>
a
rush
be
make
into
the
hall
and
in
a
very
few
minute
its
chamber
be
ransack
,
and
all
its
hide
place
carefully
search
,
with
the
hope
of
discover
the
hide
form
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
 
<EOS>
the
servant
feel
that
,
with
their
inefficient
strength
,
to
oppose
the
proceeding
of
an
assemblage
which
seem
to
be
unchecked
by
all
sort
of
law
or
reason
,
would
be
madness
;
they
therefore
only
look
on
,
with
wonder
and
dismay
,
satisfy
certainly
in
their
own
mind
that
Sir
Francis
would
not
be
find
,
and
indulge
in
much
conjecture
as
to
what
would
be
the
result
of
such
violent
and
unexpected
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Chillingworth
hope
that
time
be
be
gain
,
and
that
some
sort
of
indication
of
what
be
go
on
would
reach
the
unhappy
object
of
popular
detestation
sufficiently
early
to
enable
him
to
provide
for
his
own
safety
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
he
be
break
his
own
engagement
to
be
present
at
the
duel
between
Henry
Bannerworth
and
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
and
,
as
that
thought
recur
to
him
,
he
dread
that
his
professional
service
may
be
require
on
one
side
or
the
other
;
for
he
know
,
or
fancy
he
know
,
that
mutual
hatred
dictate
the
contest
;
and
he
think
that
if
ever
a
duel
have
take
place
which
be
likely
to
be
attend
with
some
disastrous
result
,
that
be
surely
the
one
.
 
<EOS>
but
how
could
he
leave
,
watch
and
surround
as
he
be
by
an
infuriate
multitude
<EOS>
--
how
could
he
hope
but
that
his
footstep
would
be
dog
,
or
that
the
slight
attempt
of
his
to
convey
a
warning
to
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
would
not
be
the
mean
of
bring
down
upon
his
head
the
very
danger
he
seek
to
shield
him
from
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
state
of
uncertainty
,
then
,
do
our
medical
man
remain
,
a
prey
to
the
bitter
reflection
,
and
full
of
the
dire
apprehension
,
without
have
the
slight
power
of
himself
to
alter
so
disastrous
a
train
of
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
dissatisfy
with
their
non
-
success
,
the
crowd
twice
search
the
house
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
from
the
attic
to
the
basement
;
and
then
,
and
not
till
then
,
do
they
begin
reluctantly
to
believe
that
the
servant
must
have
speak
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
in
the
town
somewhere
,
"
cry
one
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
let
's
go
back
to
the
town
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
strange
how
suddenly
any
mob
will
obey
any
impulse
,
and
this
perfectly
groundless
supposition
be
sufficient
to
turn
their
step
back
again
in
<EOS>
the
direction
whence
<EOS>
they
come
,
and
they
have
actually
,
in
a
straggle
sort
of
column
,
reach
halfway
towards
the
town
,
when
they
encounter
a
boy
,
whose
professional
pursuit
consist
in
tend
sheep
very
early
of
a
morning
,
and
who
at
once
inform
them
that
he
have
see
Sir
Francis
Varney
in
the
wood
,
half
way
between
Bannerworth
Hall
and
his
own
home
.
 
<EOS>
this
event
at
once
turn
the
whole
tide
again
,
and
with
renew
clamour
,
carry
Mr.
Chillingworth
along
with
them
<EOS>
,
they
now
rapidly
near
the
real
spot
,
where
,
probably
,
have
they
turn
a
little
earlier
,
they
would
have
view
the
object
of
their
suspicion
and
hatred
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
we
have
already
record
,
the
advance
throng
be
see
by
the
party
on
the
ground
,
where
the
duel
could
scarcely
have
be
say
to
have
be
fight
;
and
then
have
Sir
Francis
Varney
dash
into
the
wood
,
which
be
so
opportunely
at
hand
to
afford
him
a
shelter
from
his
enemy
,
and
from
the
intricacy
of
which
--
well
acquaint
with
them
as
he
doubtles
was,--he
have
every
chance
of
elude
their
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
affair
be
a
great
surprise
to
Henry
and
his
friend
,
when
they
see
such
a
string
of
people
advance
,
with
such
shout
and
imprecation
;
they
could
not
,
for
the
life
of
them
,
imagine
what
could
have
excite
such
a
turn
out
among
the
ordinarily
industrious
and
quiet
inhabitant
of
a
town
,
remarkable
rather
for
the
quietude
and
steadiness
of
its
population
,
than
for
any
violent
outbreak
of
popular
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
can
Mr.
Chillingworth
be
about
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
to
bring
such
a
mob
here
?
<EOS>
have
he
take
leave
of
his
sense
?
<EOS>
"
 
"
Nay
,
"
say
marchdale
;
"
look
again
;
he
seem
to
be
try
to
keep
them
back
,
although
ineffectually
,
for
they
will
not
be
stay
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
D----e
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
"
here
be
a
gang
of
pirate
;
we

<EOS>
"
ay
ay

Jack

<EOS>
"
and
be
that
all
you
have
get
to

,
you
lubber
,
when
you
see
your
admiral
in
danger

<EOS>
You
would
better
go
and
make
term
with
the
enemy
at
once

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
really
,
this
be
serious
,
"
say
Henry
;
"
they
shout
for
Varney
.
<EOS>
Can
Mr.
Chillingworth
have
be
so
mad
as
to
adopt
this
means
of
stop
the
duel
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
impossible
,
"
say
Marchdale
;
"
if
that
have
be
his
intention
,
he
could
have
do
so
quietly
,
through
the
medium
of
the
civil
authority
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
hang
me
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
the
admiral
,
"
if
there
be
any
civil
authority
;
they
talk
of
smash
somebody
.
<EOS>
what
do
they
say
,
Jack
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
hear
quite
so
well
as
I
use
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
always
be
a
little
deaf
,
"
say
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
little
deaf
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
lubberly
lie
swab
,
how
dare
you
say
so
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
because
you
be

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
slave

scoundrel

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
for
Heaven
's

,
do
not

at
such
a
time
as
this
!
"
<EOS>
say
Henry
;
"
we
shall
be
surround
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
come
,
Mr.
Marchdale
,
let
you
and
I
visit
these
people
,
and
ascertain
what
it
be
that
have
so
much
excited
their
indignation
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Agreed
,
"
say
Marchdale
;
and
they
both
step
forward
at
a
rapid
pace
,
to
meet
the
advance
throng
.
 
<EOS>
the
crowd
which
have
now
approach
to
within
a
short
distance
of
the
expectant
little
party
,
be
of
a
most
motley
description
,
and
its
appearance
,
under
many
circumstance
,
would
cause
considerable
risibility
.
<EOS>
man
and
woman
be
mix
indiscriminately
together
,
and
in
the
shouting
,
the
latter
,
if
such
a
thing
be
possible
,
exceed
the
former
,
both
in
discordance
and
energy
.
 
<EOS>
every
individual
composing
that
mob
carry
some
weapon
calculate
for
defence
,
such
as
flail
,
scythe
,
sickle
,
bludgeon
,
&
c.
,
and
this
mode
of
arm
cause
them
to
wear
a
most
formidable
appearance
;
while
the
passion
that
superstition
have
call
up
be
strongly
depict
in
their
inflame
feature
.
<EOS>
Their
fury
,
too
,
have
be
excite
by
their
disappointment
,
and
it
be
with
concentrated
rage
that
they
now
press
onward
.
 
<EOS>
the
calm
and
steady
advance
of
Henry
and
Mr.
Marchdale
to
meet
the
advance
throng
,
seem
to
have
the
effect
of
retard
their
progress
a
little
,
and
they
come
to
a
parley
at
a
hedge
,
which
separate
them
from
the
meadow
in
which
the
duel
have
be
fight
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
be
advance
towards
us
,
"
say
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
seek
me
or
any
of
my
friend

if
so
,
upon
what
errand
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
explain
what
be
the
cause
of
all
this
assault

You
seem

at
the

of
it

<EOS>
"
seem

Mr.
Chillingworth
,
"
without

You

any
of
your

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
who
,
then
?
"
 
"
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
"
be
the
immediate
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
<EOS>
and
what
have
he
do
to
excite
popular
indignation
?
<EOS>
of
private
wrong
I
can
accuse
him
;

I
desire
no
crowd
to
take
up
my
cause

to
avenge
my
quarrel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Bannerworth
,
it
have
become
know
,
through
my
indiscretion
,
that
Sir
Francis
Varney
be
suspect
of
be
a
vampyre
.

<EOS>
"
be
this
so

"
Hurrah

the

down

!
<EOS>
hurrah
!
<EOS>
where
be
he
?
<EOS>
down
with
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
drive
a
stake
through
him
,
"
say
a
woman
;
"
it
be
the
only
way
,
and
the
human
.
<EOS>
You
have
only
to
take
a
hedge
stake
and
sharpen
it
a
bit
at
one
end
,
and
char
it
a
little
in
the
fire
so
as
there
mayt'n't
be
no
splinter
to
hurt
,
and
then
poke
it
through
his
stomach
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
mob
give
a
great
shout
at
this
humane
piece
of
advice
,
and
it
be
some
time
before
Henry
could
make
himself
hear
at
all
,
even
to
those
who
be
near
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
do
succeed
in
so
do
,
he
cry
,
with
a
loud
voice,--
 
"
hear
me
,
all
of
you
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
needless
for
me
to
inquire
how
you
become
possess
of
the
information
that
a
dreadful
suspicion
hang
over
the
person
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
;
but
if
,
in
consequence
of
hear
such
news
,
you
fancy
this
public
demonstration
will
be
agreeable
to
me
,
or
likely
to
relieve
those
who
be
near
or
dear
to
me
from
the
state
of
misery
and
apprehension
into
which
they
have
fall
,
you
be
much
mistaken
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
hear
him
,
hear
him
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Mr.
Marchdale
;
"
he
speak
both
wisdom
and
truth
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
anything
,
"
pursue
Henry
,
"
could
add
to
the
annoyance
of
vexation

misery
we

suffer

it
would
assuredly

subject

gossip

every

clamour

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
hear
him
?
"
say
Mr.
Marchdale
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
we
do
,
"
say
a
man
;
"
but
we
come
out
to
catch
a
vampyre
,
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
to
be
sure
,
"
say
the
humane
woman
;
"
nobody
's
feeling
be
nothing
to
us
.
<EOS>
be
we
to

wake
up
in
the
night
with
vampyre
suck
our

"
 
<EOS>
"
Hurrah
!

everybody

down
with

<EOS>
where

he

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
you
be
all
wrong
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
imploringly
;
"
there
be
no
vampyre
here
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
have
not
only
escape
,
but
he
will
take
the
law
of
all
of
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
an
argument
which
appear
to
stagger
a
few
,
but
the
bolder
spirit
push
them
on
,
and
a
suggestion
to
search
the
wood
have
be
make
by
some
one
who
be
more
cunning
than
his
neighbour
,
that
measure
be
at
once
proceed
with
,
and
execute
in
a
systematic
manner
,
which
make
those
who
know
it
to
be
the
hiding
-
place
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
tremble
for
his
safety
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
with
a
strange
mixture
of
feeling
that
Henry
Bannerworth
wait
the
result
of
the
search
for
the
man
<EOS>
who
but
a
few
minute
before
have
be
oppose
to
him
in
a
contest
of
life
or
death
.
 
<EOS>
the
destruction
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
would
certainly
have
be
an
effectual
mean
of
prevent
him
from
continue
to
be
the
incubus
he
then
be
upon
the
Bannerworth
family
;
and
yet
the
generous
nature
of
Henry
shrink
with
horror
from
see
even
such
a
creature
as
Varney
sacrifice
at
the
shrine
of
popular
resentment
,
and
murder
by
an
infuriate
populace
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
as
great
an
interest
in
the
escape
of
the
vampyre
as
if
some
great
advantage
to
himself
have
be
contingent
upon
such
an
event
;
and
,
although
he
speak
not
a
word
,
while
the
echo
of
the
little
wood
be
all
awaken
by
the
clamorous
manner
in
which
the
mob
search
for
their
victim
,
his
feeling
could
be
well
read
upon
his
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
the
admiral
,
too
,
without
possess
probably
the
fine
feeling
of
Henry
Bannerworth
,
take
an
unusually
sympathetic
interest
in
the
fate
of
the
vampyre
;
and
,
after
place
himself
in
various
attitude
of
intense
excitement
,
he
exclaimed,--
 
<EOS>
"
D

<EOS>
n
it
<EOS>
,
Jack
,
I
do
hope
,
after
all
,
the
vampyre
will
get
the
well
of
them

<EOS>
It
be
like
a
whole
flotilla
attack
one
vessel
--
a
lubberly
proceed
at
the
good

I
will
be
hang
if

<EOS>
I
should
like
to
pour
in
a
broadside
into
those

just
to

them
see
it

not
a

mode
of
fighting

Should
not
you

Jack

"
 
<EOS>
"
ay

ay

"
 
<EOS>
Scarcely
have
these
word
escape
the
lip
of
the
old
admiral
than
there
arise
a
loud
shout
from
the
interior
of
the
wood

<EOS>
It
be
a
shout
of
success
,
and
seem
at
the
very
least
to
herald
the
capture
of
the
unfortunate
Varney

"
by
Heaven
!

exclaim
Henry

"
they
have
him

"
God

Mr.

this
grow
too
serious

"
 
<EOS>
"
bear
a
hand

Jack

"
say
the
admiral
:

we
will
have
a

for
it
yet

even
a

blood

load
the

send
a
flying
shot

two
among

the

<EOS>
"
no

no

say
Henry
;
"
no
more
violence

at

there
have
be
enough
--
there
have
be
enough

"
 
<EOS>
even
as
he
speak
there
come
rush
from
among
the
tree
,
at
the
corner
of
the
wood
,
the
figure
of
a
man
.
<EOS>
there
need
but
one
glance
to
assure
them
who
it
be

<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
have
be
see
,
and
be
fly
before
those
implacable
foe
who
have
seek
his
life

<EOS>
He
have
divest
himself
of
his
huge
cloak
,
as
well
as
of
his
low
slouched
hat
,
and
,
with
a
speed
which
nothing
but
the
most
absolute
desperation
could
have
enable
him
to
exert
,
he
rush
onward
,
beat
down
before
him
every
obstacle

and
bound
over
the
meadow
at
a
rate
that
,
if
he
could
have
continue
it
for
any
length
of
time
,
would
have
set
pursuit
at
defiance

<EOS>
"
Bravo
!

shout
the
admiral

a
stern

be
a
long
chase

you
ever

anybody

along
like
that

<EOS>
"
ay

ay

sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
never

you
scoundrel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
do

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
when
and
where
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
when
you
run
away
off
the
sound
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
admiral
turn
nearly
blue
with
anger
,
but
Jack
look
perfectly
imperturbable
,
as
he
added,--
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
you
run
away
after
the
french
frigate
who
would
not
stay
to
fight
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
that
indeed
.
<EOS>
there
he
go
,
put
on
every
stitch
of
canvass
,
I
will
be
bind
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
there
they
come
,
"
say
Jack
,
as
he
point
to
the
corner
of
the
wood
,
and
some
of
the
more
active
of
the
vampyre
's
pursuer
show
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
appear
as
if
the
vampyre
have
be
start
from
some
hiding
-
place
in
the
interior
of
the
wood
,
and
have
then
think
it
expedient
altogether
to
leave
that
retreat
,
and
make
his
way
to
some
more
secure
one
across
the
open
country
,
where
there
would
be
more
obstacle
to
his
discovery
than
perseverance
could
overcome
.
<EOS>
probably
,
then
,
among
the
brushwood
and
tree
,
for
a
few
moment
he
have
be
again
lose
sight
of
,
until
those
who
be
close
upon
his
track
have
emerge
from
among
the
dense
foliage
,
and
see
him
scour
across
the
country
at
such
headlong
speed
.
<EOS>
these
be
but
few
,
and
in
their
extreme
anxiety
themselves
to
capture
Varney
,
whose
precipate
and
terrified
flight
bring
a
firm
conviction
to
their
mind
of
his
be
a
vampyre
,
they
do
not
stop
to
get
much
of
a
reinforcement
,
but
plunge
on
like
greyhound
in
his
track
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
"
this
will
not
do

<EOS>
look
at
that
great
lubberly
fellow
with
the
queer
smock

frock

<EOS>
"
never
see
such
a

stop
him

<EOS>
the
man
be
come
on
at
a
prodigious
rate
,
and
Jack
,
with
all
the
deliberation
in
the
world
,
advance
to
meet
him
;
and
when
they
get
sufficiently
close
together
,
that
in
a
few
moment
they
must
encounter
each
other
,
Jack
make
himself
into
as
small
a
bundle
as
possible
,
and
present
his
shoulder
to
the
advance
countryman
in
such
a
way
,
that
he
fly
off
it
at
a
tangent
,
as
if
he
have
run
against
a
brick
wall
,
and
after
roll
head
over
heel
for
some
distance
,
safely
deposit
himself
in
a
ditch

where
he
disappear
completely
for
a

from
all
human
observation

"
 
<EOS>
"
Bravo
,
"
say
the
admiral
;
"
there
be
another
of
them

"
 
<EOS>
the
pursuer
of
Varney
the
vampyre
,
however
,
now
come
too
thick
and
fast
to
be
so
easily
disposed
of
,
and
as
soon
as
his
figure
could
be
see
course
over
the
meadow
,

spring
over
road
and
ditch
with
an
agility
almost
frightful
to
look
upon

the
whole
rabble
rout

in

<EOS>
by
this
time
,
the
man
who
have
fall
into
the
ditch
have
succeed
in
make
his
appearance
in
the
visible
world
again
,

as
he
crawl
up
the
bank
,
look
a
thing
of
mire

Jack
walk
up
to
him
with

the
man
clear
the

out
of
his

as
well
as
he
could
,
and
look
after
him
with
a
powerful
suspicion
that
in
Jack
he
see
the
very
cause
of
his
mortal
mishap
:
<EOS>
but
,
somehow
or
other
,
his
immersion
in
the
not
over
limpid
stream
have
wonderfully
cool
his
courage
,
and
cast
one
despairing
look
upon
his
begrime
apparel
,
and
another
at
the
last
of
the
straggler
who
be
pursue
Sir
Francis
Varney
across
the
field

he
think
it
prudent
to
get
home
as
fast
he
could
,
and
get
rid
of
the
disagreeable
result
of
an
adventure
which
have
turn
out
for
him
anything

auspicious

pleasant
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
as
though
by
a
sort
of
impulse
to
be
present
in
case
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
should
really
be
run
down
and
with
a
hope
of
save
him
from
personal
violence
,
have
follow
the
foremost
of
the
rioter
in
the
wood
,
find
it
now
quite
impossible
for
him
to
carry
on
such
a
chase
as
that
which
be
be
undertake
across
the
field
after
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
 
<EOS>
His
person
be
unfortunately
but
ill
qualified
for
the
continuance
of
such
a
pursuit
,
and
,
although
with
the
great
reluctance
,
he
at
last
feel
himself
compel
to
give
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
in
make
his
way
through
the
intricacy
of
the
wood
,
he
have
be
seriously
incommode
by
the
thick
undergrowth
,
and
he
have
accidentally
encounter
several
miry
pool
,
with
which
he
have
involuntarily
make
a
close
acquaintance
than
be
at
all
conducive
either
to
his
personal
appearance
or
comfort
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
's
temper
,
though
,
generally
speak
,
one
of
the
most
even
,
be
at
last
affect
by
his
mishap
,
and
he
could
not
restrain
from
an
execration
upon
his
want
of
prudence
in
let
his
wife
have
a
knowledge
of
a
secret
that
be
not
his
own
,
and
the
produce
an
unlooked
for
circumstance
,
the
termination
of
which
may
be
of
a
most
disastrous
nature
.
 
<EOS>
tired
,
therefore
,
and
nearly
exhaust
by
the
exertion
he
have
already
take
,
he
emerge
now
alone
from
the
wood
,
and
near
the
spot
where
stand
Henry
Bannerworth
and
his
friend
in
consultation
.
 
<EOS>
the
jaded
look
of
the
surgeon
be
quite
sufficient
indication
of
the
trouble
and
turmoil
he
have
go
through
,
and
some
expression
of
sympathy
for
his
condition
be
drop
by
Henry
,
to
whom
he
replied,--
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
my
young
friend
,
I
deserve
it
all
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
but
my
own
indiscretion
to
thank
for
all
the
turmoil
and
tumult
that
have
arise
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
to
what
possible
cause
can
we
attribute
such
an
outrage
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
reproach
me
as
much
as
you
will
,
I
deserve
it
.
<EOS>
a
man
may
prate
of
his
own
secret
if
he
like
,
but
he
should
be
careful
of
those
of
other
people
.
<EOS>
I
trust
yours
to
another
,
and
be
properly
punish
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
,
"
say
Henry
;
"
we
will
say
no
more
of
that
,
Mr.
Chillingworth

<EOS>
what
be
do
can
not
be
undo
,
and
we
have
better
spend
our
time
in
reflection
of
how
to
make
the
good
of
what
be
,
than
in
useless
lamentation
over
its
cause

what
be

be
do
?

"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay

I

not

have
you
fight
the
duel
?

"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;

,
as
you
perceive
,
harmlessly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
thank
Heaven
for
that

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
I
have
my
fire
,
which
Sir
Francis
Varney
refuse
to
return
;
so
the
affair
have
just
end
,
when
the
sound
of
approach
tumult
come
upon
our
ear

[

"
what
a
strange
mixture
,
"
exclaim
Marchdale
,
"
of
feeling
and
passion
this
Varney
appear
to
be
.
<EOS>
at
one
moment
act
with
the
apparent
great
malignity
;
and
another
,
seem
to
have
awaken
in
his
mind
a
romantic
generosity
which
know
no
bound
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
understand
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
nor
I
,
indeed
,
"
say
Henry
;
"
<EOS>
but
yet
I
somehow
tremble
for
his
fate
,
and
I
seem
to
feel
that
something
ought
to
be
do
to
save
him
from
the
fearful
consequence
of
popular
feeling
.
<EOS>
let
us
hasten
to
the
town
,
and
procure
what
assistance
we
may
:
but
a
few
person
,
well
organised
and
properly
armed
,
will
achieve
wonder
against
a
desultory
and
ill
-
appoint
multitude
.
<EOS>
there
may
be
a
chance
of
save
him
,
yet
,
from
the
imminent
danger
which
surround
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
proper
,
"
cry
the
admiral
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
like
to
see
anybody

down

another

quarter

anything

<EOS>
what
do
you
think
of
it
,
Jack
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
mean
to
say
as
how
if
Varney
only
keep
on

be
do

that
the
devil
himself

not

<EOS>
"
and
yet
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
it
be
our
duty
to
do
the
good
we
can
.
<EOS>
let
us
at

to
the
town
,
and
summon
all
the
assistance
in
our

<EOS>
come
on
--
come
on
!
"
 
<EOS>
His
friend
need
no
further
urge
,
but
,
at
a
brisk
pace
,
they
all
proceed
by
the
near
footpath
towards
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
It
puzzle
his
pursuer
to
think
in
what
possible
direction
Sir
Francis
Varney
expect
to
find
sustenance
or
succour
,
when
they
see
how
curiously
he
take
his
flight
across
the
meadow
.
<EOS>
instead
of
endeavour
,
by
any
circuitous
path
,
to
seek
the
shelter
of
his
own
house
,
or
to
throw
himself
upon
the
care
of
the
authority
of
the
town
,
who
must
,
to
the
extent
of
their
power
,
have
protect
him
,
he
strike
across
the
field
,
apparently
without
aim
or
purpose
,
seemingly
intent
upon
nothing
but
to
distance
his
pursuer
in
a
long
chase
,
which
may
possibly
tire
them
,
or
it
may
not
,
accord
to
their
or
his
power
of
endurance
.
 
<EOS>
We
say
this
seem
to
be
the
case
,
but
it
be
not
so
in
reality
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
have
a
deep
purpose
,
and
it
be
scarcely
to
be
suppose
that
a
man
of
his
subtle
genius
,
and
,
apparently
,
far
-
see
and
reflect
intellect
,
could
have
so
far
overlook
the
many
danger
of
his
position
as
not
to
be
fully
prepared
for
some
such
contingency
as
that
which
have
just
now
occur
.
 
<EOS>
Holding
,
as
he
do
,
so
strange
a
place
in
society
--
live
among
man
,
and
yet
possess
so
few
attribute
in
common
with
humanity
--
he
must
all
along
have
feel
the
possibility
of
draw
upon
himself
popular
violence
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
wholly
rely
upon
the
secrecy
of
the
Bannerworth
family
,
much
as
they
may
well
be
suppose
to
shrink
from
give
publicity
to
circumstance
of
so
fearfully
strange
and
perilous
a
nature
as
those
which
have
occur
amongst
them
.
<EOS>
the
mere
accident
may
,
at
any
moment
,
make
him
the
town
's
talk
.
<EOS>
the
overhearing
of
a
few
chance
word
by
some
gossip
domestic
--
some
ebullition
of
anger
or
annoyance
by
some
member
of
the
family
--
or
a
communication
from
some
friend
who
have
be
treat
with
confidence
--
may
,
at
any
time
,
awaken
around
him
some
such
a
storm
as
that
which
now
rage
at
his
heel
.
 
<EOS>
Varney
the
vampire
must
have
calculate
this
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
feel
the
possibility
of
such
a
state
of
thing
;
and
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
politicly
provide
himself
with
some
place
of
refuge
.
 
<EOS>
after
about
twenty
minute
of
hard
chase
across
the
field
,
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
his
intention
.
<EOS>
He
have
such
a
place
of
refuge
;
and
,
strange
a
one
as
it
may
appear
,
he
speed
towards
it
in
as
direct
a
line
as
ever
a
well
-
speed
arrow
fly
towards
its
mark
.
 
<EOS>
that
place
of
refuge
,
to
the
surprise
of
every
one
,
appear
to
be
the
ancient
ruin
,
of
which
we
have
before
speak
,
and
which
be
so
well
known
to
every
inhabitant
of
the
county
.
 
<EOS>
truly
,
it
seem
like
some
act
of
mere
desperation
for
Sir
Francis
Varney
to
hope
there
to
hide
himself
.
<EOS>
there
remain
within
,
of
what
have
once
be
a
stately
pile
,
but
a
few
grey
crumble
wall
,
which
the
hunt
have
would
have
pass
unheeded
,
know
that
not
for
one
instant
could
he
have
baffle
his
pursuer
by
seek
so
inefficient
a
refuge
.
 
<EOS>
and
those
who
follow
hard
and
fast
upon
the
track
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
feel
so
sure
of
their
game
,
when
they
see
whither
he
be
speed
,
that
they
relax
in
their
haste
considerably
,
call
loudly
to
each
other
that
the
vampire
be
catch
at
last
,
for
he
could
be
easily
surround
among
the
old
ruin
,
and
drag
from
amongst
its
moss
-
grow
wall
.
 
<EOS>
in
another
moment
,
with
a
wild
dash
and
a
cry
of
exultation
,
he
spring
out
of
sight
,
behind
an
angle
,
form
by
what
have
be
at
one
time
one
of
the
principal
support
of
the
ancient
structure
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
as
if
there
be
still
something
so
dangerous
about
him
,
that
only
by
a
great
number
of
hand
could
he
be
hope
to
be
secure
,
the
infuriate
peasantry
gather
in
a
dense
circle
around
what
they
consider
his
temporary
place
of
refuge
,
and
as
the
sun
,
which
have
now
climb
above
the
tree
top
,
and
disperse
,
in
a
great
measure
,
many
of
the
heavy
cloud
of
morning
,
shine
down
upon
the
excited
group
,
they
may
have
be
suppose
there
assemble
to
perform
some
superstitious
rite
,
which
time
have
hallow
as
an
association
of
the
crumble
ruin
around
which
they
stand
.
 
<EOS>
by
the
time
the
whole
of
the
straggler
,
who
have
persist
in
the
chase
,
have
come
up
,
there
may
have
be
about
fifty
or
sixty
resolute
man
,
each
intent
upon
secure
the
person
of
one
whom
they
feel
,
while
in
existence
,
would
continue
to
be
a
terror
to
all
the
weak
and
dearer
portion
of
their
domestic
circle
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
pause
of
several
minute
.
<EOS>
those
who
have
come
the
fleet
be
gather
breath
,
and
those
who
have
come
up
last
be
look
to
their
more
forward
companion
for
some
information
as
to
what
have
occur
before
their
arrival
.
 
<EOS>
all
be
profoundly
still
within
the
ruin
,
and
then
suddenly
,
as
if
by
common
consent
,
there
arise
from
every
throat
a
loud
shout
of
"
down
with
the
vampyre
!
<EOS>
down
with
the
vampyre
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
echo
of
that
shout
die
away
,
and
then
all
be
still
as
before
,
while
a
superstitious
feeling
creep
over
even
the
bold
.
<EOS>
It
would
almost
seem
as
if
they
have
expect
some
kind
of
response
from
Sir
Francis
Varney
to
the
shout
of
defiance
with
which
they
have
just
greet
him
;
but
the
very
calmness
,
repose
,
and
absolute
quiet
of
the
ruin
,
and
all
about
it
,
alarm
them
,
and
they
look
the
one
at
the
other
as
if
the
adventure
after
all
be
not
one
of
the
pleasantest
description
,
and
may
not
fall
out
so
happily
as
they
have
expect
.
 
<EOS>
yet
what
danger
could
there
be
?
<EOS>
there
be
they
,
more
than
half
a
hundred
stout
,
strong
man
,
to
cope
with
one
;
they
feel
convinced
that
he
be
completely
in
their
power
;
they
know
the
ruin
could
not
hide
him
,
and
that
five
minute
time
give
to
the
task
,
would
suffice
to
explore
every
nook
and
corner
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
they
hesitate
,
while
an
unknown
terror
shake
their
nerve
,
and
seemingly
from
the
very
fact
that
they
have
run
down
their
game
successfully
,
they
dread
to
secure
the
trophy
of
the
chase
.
 
<EOS>
one
bold
spirit
be
want
;
and
,
if
it
be
not
a
bold
one
that
speak
at
length
,
he
may
be
compliment
as
be
comparatively
such
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
who
have
not
be
foremost
in
the
chase
,
perchance
from
want
of
physical
power
,
who
now
stand
forward
,
and
exclaimed,--
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
you
wait
for
,
now
?
<EOS>
You
can
have
him
when
you
like
.
<EOS>
if
you
want
your
wife
and
child
to
sleep
quietly
in
their
bed
,
you
will
secure
the
vampyre
.
<EOS>
come
on
<EOS>
--
we
all
know
he
be
here
--
why
do
you
hesitate
?
<EOS>
do
you
expect
me
to
go
alone
and
drag
him
out
by
the
ear
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
any
voice
would
have
suffice
to
break
the
spell
which
bind
them
.
<EOS>
this
do
so
;
and
,
with
one
accord
,
and
yell
of
imprecation
,
they
rush
forward
and
plunge
among
the
old
wall
of
the
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
Less
time
than
we
have
before
remark
would
have
enable
any
one
to
explore
the
totter
fabric
sufficient
to
bring
a
conviction
to
their
mind
that
,
after
all
,
there
may
have
be
some
mistake
about
the
matter
,
and
Sir
Francis
Varney
be
not
quite
catch
yet
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
astonish
how
the
fact
of
not
find
him
in
a
moment
,
again
rouse
all
their
angry
feeling
against
him
,
and
dispel
every
feeling
of
superstitious
awe
with
which
he
have
be
surround
;
rage
give
place
to
the
sort
of
shudder
horror
with
which
they
have
before
contemplate
his
immediate
destruction
,
when
they
have
believe
him
to
be
virtually
within
their
very
grasp
.
 
<EOS>
over
and
over
again
the
ruin
be
search
--
hastily
and
impatiently
by
some
,
carefully
and
deliberately
by
other
,
until
there
could
be
no
doubt
upon
the
mind
of
every
one
individual
,
that
somehow
or
somewhere
within
the
shadow
of
those
wall
,
Sir
Francis
Varney
have
disappear
most
mysteriously
.
 
<EOS>
then
it
would
have
be
a
strange
sight
for
any
indifferent
spectator
to
have
see
how
they
shrunk
,
one
by
one
,
out
of
the
shadow
of
those
ruin
;
each
seeming
to
be
afraid
that
the
vampyre
,
in
some
mysterious
manner
,
would
catch
him
if
he
happen
to
be
the
last
within
their
sombre
influence
;
and
,
when
they
have
all
collect
in
the
bright
,
open
space
,
some
little
distance
beyond
,
they
look
at
each
other
and
at
the
ruin
,
with
dubious
expression
of
countenance
,
each
,
no
doubt
,
wish
that
each
would
suggest
something
of
a
consolatory
or
practicable
character
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
to
be
do
,
now
?
"
say
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
that
be
it
,
"
say
another
,
sententiously
.
<EOS>
"

"
He

<EOS>
"
but
he
can
not

the

"
say
one
man
,
who
be
particularly
famous
for
a
dogmatical
spirit
of
argumentation
;
"
how
be
it
possible
?
<EOS>
he
must
be

,
and
I
say
he
be

"
 
<EOS>
"
find

then

"
cry
several
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
that
be
nothing
to
do
with
the
argument
;
he
be
here
,
whether
we
find
him
or
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
one
very
cunning
fellow
lay
his
finger
on
his
nose
,
and
beckon
to
a
comrade
to
retire
some
pace
,
where
he
deliver
himself
of
the
follow
very
oracular
sentiment:--
 
<EOS>
"
My
good
friend
,
you
must
know
Sir
Francis
Varney
be
here
or
he
be
not
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Agreed
,
agree
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
if
he
be
not
here
it
be
no
use
trouble
our
head
any
more
about
him
;
but
,
otherwise
,
it
be
quite
another
thing
,
and
,
upon
the
whole
,
I
must
say
,
that
I
rather
think
he
be
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
all
look
at
him
,
for
it
be
evident
<EOS>
he
be
big
with
some
suggestion
.
<EOS>
after
a
pause
,
he
resumed,--
 
<EOS>
"
now
,
my
good
friend
,
I
propose
that
we
all
appear
to
give
it
up
,
and
to
go
away
;
but
that
some
one
of
us
shall
remain
and
hide
among
the
ruin
for
some
time
,
to
watch
,
<EOS>
in
case
the
vampyre
make
his
appearance
from
some
hole
or
corner
that
we
have
not
find
out
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
capital
!
"
say
everybody
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
all
agree
to
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
good
;
that
be
the
only
way
to
nick
him
.
<EOS>
now
,
we
will
pretend
to
give
it
up
;
let
's
all
of
us
talk
loud
about
go
home
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
do
all
talk
loud
about
go
home
;
they
swear
that
it
be
not
worth
the
trouble
of
catch
him
,
that
they
give
it
up
as
a
bad
job
;
that
he
may
go
to
the
deuce
in
any
way
he
like
,
for
all
they
care
;
and
then
they
all
walk
off
in
a
body
,
when
,
the
man
who
have
make
the
suggestion
,
suddenly
cried,--
 
<EOS>
"
Hilloa
!
<EOS>
hilloa!--stop
!
<EOS>
stop
!
<EOS>
you
know
one
of
us
be
to

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
ay
;
yes
,
yes
,
yes
!
"
say
everybody
,
and
still
they
move
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
really
,
you
know
,
what
be
the
use
of
this
?
<EOS>
who
be
to
wait
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
that
be
,
indeed
,
a
knotty
question
,
which
induce
a
serious
consultation
,
end
in
their
all
,
with
one
accord
,
pitch
upon
the
author
of
the
suggestion
,
as
by
far
the
good
person
to
hide
in
the
ruin
and
catch
the
vampyre
.
 
<EOS>
They
then
all
set
off
at
full
speed
;
but
the
cunning
fellow
,
who
certainly
have
not
the
slight
idea
of
so
practically
carry
out
his
own
suggestion
,
scamper
off
after
them
with
a
speed
that
soon
bring
him
in
the
midst
of
the
throng
again
,
and
so
,
with
fear
in
their
look
,
and
all
the
evidence
of
fatigue
about
them
,
they
reach
the
town
to
spread
fresh
and
more
exaggerated
account
of
the
mysterious
conduct

[

<EOS>
We
have
before
slightly
mention
to
the
reader
,
and
not
unadvisedly
,
the
existence
of
a
certain
prisoner
,
confine
in
a
gloomy
dungeon
,
into
whose
sad
and
blacken
recess
but
few
and
faint
glimmering
ray
of
light
ever
penetrate
;
for
,
by
a
diabolical
ingenuity
,
the
narrow
loophole
which
serve
for
a
window
to
that
subterraneous
abode
be
so
construct
,
that
,
let
the
sun
be
at
what
point
<EOS>
it
may
,
during
its
diurnal
course
,
but
a
few
reflected
beam
of
light
could
ever
find
their
way
into
that
abode
of
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
the
prisoner
--
the
same
prisoner
of
whom
we
before
speak
--
be
there
.
<EOS>
despair
be
in
his
look
,
and
his
temple
be
still
bind
with
those
cloth
,
which
seem
now
for
many
day
to
have
be
sop
in
blood
,
which
have
become
encrusted
in
their
fold
.
 
<EOS>
He
still
live
,
apparently
incapable
of
movement
.
<EOS>
how
he
have
live
so
long
seem
to
be
a
mystery
,
for
one
would
think
him
scarcely
in
a
state
,
even
be
nourishment
place
to
his
lip
,
to
enable
him
to
swallow
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
,
however
,
that
the
mind
have
as
much
to
do
with
that
apparent
absolute
prostration
of
all
sort
of
physical
energy
as
those
bodily
wound
which
he
have
receive
at
the
hand
of
the
enemy
who
have
reduce
him
to
his
present
painful
and
hopeless
situation
.
 
<EOS>
occasionally
a
low
groan
burst
from
his
lip
;
it
seem
to
come
from
the
very
bottom
of
his
heart
,
and
it
sound
as
if
it
would
carry
with
it
every
remnant
of
vitality
that
be
yet
remain
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
move
restlessly
,
and
repeat
in
hurried
accent
the
name
of
some
who
be
dear
to
him
,
and
far
away
--
some
who
may
,
perchance
,
be
mourn
him
,
but
who
know
not
,
guess
not
,
aught
of
his
present
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
thus
move
,
the
rustle
of
a
chain
among
the
straw
on
which
he
lie
give
an
indication
,
that
even
in
that
dungeon
it
have
not
be
consider
prudent
to
leave
him
master
of
his
own
action
,
l
,
by
too
vigorous
an
effort
,
he
may
escape
from
the
thraldom
in
which
he
be
hold
.
 
<EOS>
the
sound
reach
his
own
ear
,
and
for
a
few
moment
,
in
the
deep
impatience
of
his
wounded
spirit
,
he
heap
malediction
on
the
head
of
those
who
have
reduce
him
to
his
present
state
.
 
<EOS>
but
soon
a
well
nature
seem
to
come
over
him
,
and
gentler
word
fall
from
his
lip
.
<EOS>
He
preach
patience
to
himself
--
he
talk
not
of
revenge
,
but
of
justice
,
and
in
accent
of
more
hopefulness
than
he
have
before
speak
,
he
call
upon
Heaven
to
succour
him
in
his
deep
distress
.
 
<EOS>
then
all
be
still
,
and
the
prisoner
appear
to
have
resign
himself
once
more
to
the
calmness
of
expectation
or
of
despair
;
but
hark
!
<EOS>
his
sense
of
hearing
,
render
doubly
acute
by
lie
so
long
alone
in
nearly
darkness
,
and
in
positive
silence
<EOS>
,
detect
sound
which
,
to
ordinary
mortal
power
of
perception
,
would
have
be
by
far
too
indistinct
to
produce
any
tangible
effect
upon
the
sense
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
sound
of
foot
--
<EOS>
on
,
on
they
come
;
far
overhead
he
hear
them
;
they
beat
the
green
earth
--
that
sweet
,
verdant
sod
,
which
he
may
never
see
again
--
with
an
impatient
tread
.
<EOS>
nearer
and
nearer
still
<EOS>
;
and
now
they
pause
;
he
listen
with
all
the
intensity
of
one
who
listen
for
existence
;
some
one
come
;
there
be
a
lumber
noise
--
a
hasty
footstep
;
he
hear
some
one
labour
for
breath
--
pant
like
a
hunted
hare
;
his
dungeon
door
be
open
,
and
there
totter
in
a
man
,
tall
and
gaunt
;
he
reel
like
one
intoxicated
;
fatigue
have
do
more
than
the
work
of
inebriation
;
he
can
not
save
himself
,
and
he
sink
exhaust
by
the
side
of
that
lonely
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
the
captive
raise
himself
as
far
as
his
chain
will
allow
him
;
he
clutch
the
throat
of
his
enervated
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Villain
,
monster
,
vampyre
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
shriek
,
"
I
have
thee
now
;
"
and
lock
in
a
deadly
embrace
,
they
roll
upon
the
damp
earth
,
struggle
for
life
together

It

day
at
Bannerworth
Hall

and
Flora
be
look
from
the
casement
anxiously
expect
the
arrival
of
her
brother

<EOS>
She
have
see
,
from
some
of
the
topmost
window
of
the
Hall
,
that
the
whole
neighbourhood
have
be
in
a

of
commotion

<EOS>
little
do
she
guess
the
cause
of
so
much
tumult
,
or
that
it
in

concern
her

<EOS>
She
have
see
the
peasantry
forsake
their
work
in
the
field
and
the
gardens
,
and
apparently
intent
upon
some
object
of
absorb
interest

she
fear
to
leave

she
have

so
,
lest
the
former
pacific
conduct
of
the
vampyre
should
have
be
but
a
new
snare
,
for
the
purpose
of
draw
her
so
far
from
her
home
as
to
lead
her
into
some
danger
when
she
should
be
far
from
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
more
than
once
be
she
tempt
to
forget
her
promise
,
and
to
seek
the
open
country
,
for
fear
that
those
she
love
should
be
encounter
some
danger
for
her
sake
,
which
she
would
willingly
either
share
with
them
or
spare
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
solicitation
,
however
,
of
her
brother
keep
her
comparatively
quiet
;
and
,
moreover
,
since
her
last
interview
with
Varney
,
in
which
,
at
all
event
,
he
have
show
some
feeling
for
the
melancholy
situation
to
which
,
he
have
reduce
her
,
she
have
be
more
able
to
reason
calmly
,
and
to
meet
the
suggestion
of
passion
and
of
impulse
with
a
sober
judgment
.
 
<EOS>
about
midday
,
then
,
she
see
the
domestic
party
return
--
that
party
,
which
now
consist
of
her
two
brother
,
the
admiral
,
Jack
Pringle
,
and
Mr.
Chillingworth
.
<EOS>
as
for
Mr.
Marchdale
,
he
have
give
them
a
polite
adieu
on
the
confine
of
the
ground
of
Bannerworth
Hall
,
state
,
<EOS>
that
although
he
have
feel
it
to
be
his
duty
to
come
forward
and
second
Henry
Bannerworth
in
the
duel
with
the
vampyre
,
yet
that
circumstance
by
no
mean
obliterate
from
his
memory
the
insult
he
have
receive
from
Admiral
Bell
,
and
,
therefore
,
he
decline
go
to
Bannerworth
Hall
,
and
bade
them
a
very
good
morning
.
 
<EOS>
to
all
this
,
Admiral
Bell
reply
that
he
may
go
and
be
d----d
,
if
he
like
,
and
that
he
consider
him
a
swab
and
a
humbug
,
and
appeal
to
Jack
Pringle
whether
he
,
Jack
,
ever
see
such
a
sanctify
look
prig
in
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
,
"
say
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
this
answer
,
of
course
,
produce
the
usual
contention
,
which
last
them
until
they
get
fairly
in
the
house
,
where
they
swear
at
each
other
to
an
extent
that
be
enough
to
make
any
one
's
hair
stand
on
end
,
until
Henry
and
Mr.
Chillingworth
interfere
,
and
really
beg
that
they
would
postpone
the
discussion
until
some
more
fitting
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
of
the
circumstance
be
then
relate
to
Flora
;
who
,
while
she
blame
her
brother
much
for
fight
the
duel
with
the
vampyre
,
find
in
the
conduct
of
that
mysterious
individual
,
as
regard
the
encounter
,
yet
another
reason
for
believe
him
to
be
strictly
sincere
in
his
desire
to
save
her
from
the
consequence
of
his
future
visit
.
 
<EOS>
Her
desire
to
leave
Bannerworth
Hall
consequently
become
more
and
more
intense
,
and
as
the
admiral
really
now
consider
himself
the
master
of
the
house
,
they
offer
no
amount
of
opposition
to
the
subject
,
but
merely
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Flora
,
Admiral
Bell
shall
decide
in
all
these
matter
,
now
.
<EOS>
We
know
that
he
be
our
sincere
friend
;
and
that
whatever
he
say
we
ought
to
do
,
will
be
dictate
by
the
good
possible
feeling
towards
us
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
I
appeal
to
you
,
sir
,
"
say
Flora
,
turn
to
the
admiral
.
 
<EOS>
"
very
good
,
"
reply
the
old
man
;
"
<EOS>
then
I
say--
<EOS>
"
 
"
Nay
,
admiral
,
"
interrupt
Mr.
Chillingworth
;
"
you
promise
me
,
but
a
short
time
since
,
that
you
would
come
to
no
decision
<EOS>
whatever
upon
this
question
,
until
you
have
hear
some
particular
which
I
have
to
relate
to
you
,
which
,
in
my
humble
opinion
,
will
sway
your
judgment
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
so
I
do
,
"
cry
the
admiral
;
"
but
I
have
forget
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
Flora
,
my
dear
,
I
will
be
with
you
in
an
hour

two

<EOS>
My
friend

the
doctor

here
,
have
get
some
sow
by
the
ear

and
fancy
<EOS>
it
be
the
right
one
;
however
,
I
will
hear
what
he
have
get
to
say
,
first
,
before
we
come
to
a
conclusion
.
<EOS>
so
,
come
along
,
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
and
let
's
have
it
out
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Flora
,
"
say
Henry
,
when
the
admiral
have
leave
the
room
,
"
I
can
see
that
you
wish
to
leave
the
Hall

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
brother

but
not
to
go
far

rather
to

from
Varney

to
make
myself
inaccessible
by
distance

You
still
cling

I
do

you
know
with
what
hope
I
cling

it

perfectly

you
still

it

You

<EOS>
"
oh

yes

as
I
believe
in
Heaven
's
mercy

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
,
Flora
;
I
would
not
doubt
him
now
for
world
;
something
even
now
seem
to
whisper
to
me
that
a
bright
sun
of
happiness
will
yet
dawn
upon
us
,
and
that
,
when
the
mist
which
at
present
enshroud
ourselves

our
fortune
pass
away
,
they
will
disclose
a
landscape
full
of
beauty

the
future

which
shall
know
no

"
 
<EOS>
"
yes

exclaim
Flora
,
enthusiastically
<EOS>
;
"
this
,
after
all
,
may
be

some
trial

grievous

to
make
the

look
more
bright

the
sweetness

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
,
indeed
now
,
a
hopefulness
about
the
manner
in
which
Henry
Bannerworth
speak
,
such
as
Flora
have
not
for
some
weary
month
have
the
pleasure
of
listen
to
,

she
eagerly
rise
to
accompany
him
into
the
garden

be
glow
with
all
the
beauty
of
sunshine
,
for
the
day

turn
out
to
be
much
fine

the
early
morning
have
at
all
promise
it
would
be

<EOS>
"
Flora

"
he
say
,
when
they
have
take
some
turn
to
and
fro
in
the
garden

"
notwithstanding
all
that
have
happen
<EOS>
,
there
be
no
convincing
Mr.
Chillingworth

Sir
Francis
Varney

really
what
to
us
he
appear

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
so
.
<EOS>
in
the
face
of
all
evidence
,
he
neither
will
believe
in
vampyre
at
all

nor
that
Varney
be
anything

some
mortal
man
,
like
ourselves
,
in
his
thought

talent

feeling
,
and
mode
of
life

with
no
more
power

do
any

an
injury

we
have

"
 
<EOS>

oh
,
would
that
I
could
think
so
!

<EOS>

I
;

,
unhappily

we
have
by

too
many
,

conclusive
evidence

the
contrary

<EOS>

We
have
,
indeed

respect
that
strength
of
mind
in
our
friend
which
will
not
allow
him
,
even
almost
at
the
last
extremity
,
to
yield
to
what
appear
to
be
stern
fact

we
may
not
ourselves

You
have
no

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
most
reluctantly

I
must
confess

that
I
feel

consider
Varney

something
more
than
mortal

He
must
be
so

now

before
we
leave
the
place

have
be
a
home
to
us
from
early
life

let
us
for
a
few
moment
consider
if
there
be
any
possible
excuse
for
the
notion
of
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
to
the
effect
that
Sir
Francis
Varney
want
possession
of
the
house
for
some
purpose
still
more
inimical
to
our
peace
and
prosperity
than
any
he
have
yet
attempt

"
 
<EOS>
"
have
he
such
an
opinion
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
have
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
'
Tis
very
strange
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Flora
;
he
seem
to
gather
from
all
the
circumstance
,
nothing
but
an
overwhelming
desire
on
the
part
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
to
become
the
tenant
of
Bannerworth
Hall
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
certainly
wish
to
possess
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
but
can
you
,
sister
,
in
the
exercise
of
any
possible
amount
of
fancy
,
imagine
any
motive
for
such
an
anxiety
beyond
what
he
allege
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
which
be
merely
that
he
be
fond
of
old
house
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
precisely
so
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
reason
,

the
only
one
,
that
can
be
get
from
him
.
<EOS>
Heaven
only
know
if
it
be
the
true
one

"
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
,
brother

"
 
<EOS>
"
as
you
say
,
it
may
;

there
be
a
doubt

nevertheless
,
Flora

<EOS>
I
much
rejoice
that
you
have
have
an
interview

you
have
certainty

happy

more
composed

I

again

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
indeed
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
sufficiently
perceivable
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
somehow
,
brother
,
since
that
interview
,
I
have
not
have
the
same
sort
of
dread
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
which
before
make
the
very
sound
of
his
name
a
note
of
terror
to
me
.
<EOS>
His
word
,
and
all
<EOS>
he
say
to
me
during
that
interview
which
take
place
so
strangely
between
us
,
indeed
how
I
know
not
,
tend
altogether
rather
to
make
him
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
an
object
of
my
sympathy
rather
than
my
abhorrence
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
that
be
very
strange

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
own
that
it
be
strange

Henry

but
when
we
come
for
but
a
brief
moment
to
reflect
upon
the
circumstance
which
have
occur
,
we
shall
,
I
think
,
be
able

find
some
cause
even
to
pity
Varney
the
vampyre

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
?
"
 
<EOS>

thus
,
brother

<EOS>
It
be
say
--
and
well
may
I
who
have
be
subject
to
an
attack
of
such
a
nature
,
tremble
to
repeat
the
saying
--
that
those
who
have
be
once
subject
to
the
visitation
of
a
vampyre

be
themselves
in
a
way
to
become
one
of
the
dreadful
and
madden
fraternity

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
so
much
,

reply
Henry

<EOS>
"
yes
;
and
therefore
who
know
but
that
Sir
Francis

may
,
at
one
time

have
be
as
innocent
as
we
be
ourselves

the
terrible

fiendish
propensity

now
make
him
a
terror

be
in

way
obnoxious

there
may
have
be
a
time
--
who
shall
say
there
be
not?--when
<EOS>
he
,
like

would
have
shrink

with
a
dread

great

the
contamination

touch

I
can
not

deny
the
soundness
of
your
reasoning

say
Henry

with
a
sigh
;
"
but
I
still
no
not
see
anything
,
even
from
a
full
conviction

unfortunate

should
induce

to
tolerate
him

"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
brother

I
say
not
tolerate
.
<EOS>
what
I
mean
be
,
that
even
with
the
horror

dread
we
must
naturally
feel
at
such
a
being

we
may
afford
to
mingle
some
amount
of
pity

which
shall
make
us
rather
seek
to
shun
him

to
cross
his

a
resolution

do
him
an
injury

<EOS>

I
perceive
well

what
you
mean

<EOS>
rather
than
remain
here

make
an

singular
report

should
readily
,

without
abundant
satisfaction

subside

an
idea

that

lend
so
powerful
an
impulse

the
popular

be

far
easy

the

circumstance

make
him

his
act
appear
in
still
more
dreadful
colour

mob
do
not
reason
very
closely

clearly

the
very
fact
of
the
frantic
flight
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
from
the
project
attack
of
the
infuriate
multitude
,
be
seize
hold
of
as
proof
positive
of
the
reality
of
his
vampyre
-
like
existence

<EOS>
then
,
again
,
have
he
not
disappear
in
the
most
mysterious
manner

<EOS>
have
he
not
seek
refuge
where
no
human
being
would
think
of
seek
refuge
,

,
in
that
old

dilapidated
ruin

where
,
when
his
pursuer
be
so
close
upon
his
track
,
he
have
succeed
in
elude
their
grasp
with
a
facility
which
look
as

have
vanish
into
thin
air
,

as
if

very
earth
have
open
to
receive
him
bodily
within
its
cold
embrace

<EOS>
It
be
not

be
wonder
at
,
that
the
few
who
flee
so
precipitately
from
the
ruin

lose
nothing
of
the
wonderful
story
they
have
to
tell
,
in
the
carry
it
from

place
to
the
town

<EOS>
when
they
reach
their
neighbour

they
not
only
tell
what
have
really
occur

they
add
to
it
all
their
own
surmise
,
and
the
fanciful
creation
of
all
their

fear
,
so
that
before
mid

day

about
the
time
when
Henry

be
converse
so
quietly

no

all

suspend

person

now
that
once
the

concern
the

may
have
be
visit
some
of

in

<EOS>
some
,
too

noise
incidental

disappear
when

<EOS>
the

and
he
be
a
remarkably
clever

who
make
the
slight
remark
upon
the

hazard
a

<EOS>
He
know
something
of
vampyre

<EOS>
He
have
travel
abroad

and
have
hear
of
them
in
Germany
,
as
well
as
in
the
east
,
and
,
to
a
crowd
of
wondering
and
aghast
listener
,
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
depend
upon
it
,
my
friend

this
have
be
go
on
for
some
time

there
have
be
several
mysterious
and
sudden
death
in
the
town
lately

people

waste
away

nobody

"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
--
yes
,
"
say
everybody

<EOS>
"
there
be
Miles

the
butcher
;
you
know
how
fat
he
be
,
and
then
how
fat
he
be
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
a
general
assent
be
give
to
the
proposition
;
and
then
,
elevate
one
arm
in
an
oratorical
manner
,
the
clever
fellow
continued,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
a
doubt
that
Miles
,
the
butcher
,
and
every
one
else
who
have
die
suddenly
lately
,
have
be
victim
of
the
vampyre
;
and
what
be
more
,
they
will
all
be
vampyre
,
and
come
and
suck
other
people
's
blood
,
till
at
last
the
whole
town
will
be
a
town
of
vampyre
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
what
be
to
be
do
?
"
cry
one
,
who
tremble
so
excessively
that
he
could
scarcely
stand
under
his
apprehension
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
but
one
plan
--
Sir
Francis
Varney
must
be
find
,
and
put
out
of
the
world
in
such
a
manner
that
he
can
not
come
back
to
it
again
;
and
all
those
who
be
dead
that
we
have
any
suspicion
of
,
should
be
take
up
out
of
their
grave
and
look
at
,
to
see
if
they
be
rot
or
not
;
if
they
be
it
be
all
right
;
but
,
if
they
look
fresh
and
much
,
as
usual
,
you
may
depend
they
be
vampyre
,
and
no
mistake
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
terrific
suggestion
throw
amongst
a
mob
.
<EOS>
to
have
catch
Sir
Francis
Varney
and
immolate
him
at
the
shrine
of
popular
fury
,
they
would
not
have
shrink
from
;
but
a
desecration
of
the
grave
of
those
whom
they
have
know
in
life
be
a
matter
which
,
however
much
it
have
to
recommend
it
,
even
the
boldest
stand
aghast
at
,
and
feel
some
qualm
of
irresolution
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
many
idea
,
however
,
which
,
like
the
first
plunge
into
a
cold
bath
,
be
rather
uncomfortable
for
the
moment
;
but
which
,
in
a
little
time
,
we
become
so
familiarized
with
,
that
they
become
strip
of
their
disagreeable
concomitant
,
and
appear
quite
pleasing
and
natural
.
 
<EOS>
so
it
be
with
this
notion
of
exhume
the
dead
body
of
those
townspeople
who
have
recently
die
from
what
be
call
a
decay
of
nature
,
and
such
other
failure
of
vitality
as
bear
not
the
tangible
name
of
any
understand
disease
.
 
<EOS>
from
mouth
to
mouth
the
awful
suggestion
spread
like
wildfire
,
until
at
last
it
grow
into
such
a
shape
that
it
almost
seem
to
become
a
duty
,
at
all
event
,
to
have
up
mile
the
butcher
,
and
see
how
he
look
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
,
too
,
about
human
nature
a
natural
craving
curiosity
concern
everything
connect
with
the
dead
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
man
of
education
or
of
intellectual
endowment
who
would
not
travel
many
mile
to
look
upon
the
exhumation
of
the
remain
of
some
one
famous
in
his
time
,
whether
for
his
vice
,
his
virtue
,
his
knowledge
,
his
talent
,
or
his
heroism
;
and
,
if
this
feeling
exist
in
the
mind
of
the
educate
and
refine
in
a
sublimate
shape
,
which
lend
to
it
grace
and
dignity
,
we
may
look
for
it
among
the
vulgar
and
the
ignorant
,
take
only
a
gross
and
mean
form
,
in
accordance
with
their
habit
of
thought
.
<EOS>
the
rude
material
,
of
which
the
high
and
noblest
feeling
of
educate
mind
be
form
,
will
be
find
amongst
the
most
grovelling
and
base
;
and
so
this
vulgar
curiosity
,
which
,
combine
with
other
feeling
,
prompt
an
ignorant
and
illiterate
mob
to
exhume
Miles
,
the
once
fat
butcher
,
in
a
different
form
tempt
the
philosophic
Hamlet
to
moralise
upon
the
skull
of
Yorick
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
wonderful
to
see
<EOS>
how
,
when
these
people
have
make
up
their
mind
to
carry
out
the
singularly
interesting
,
but
,
at
the
same
,
fearful
,
suggestion
,
they
assume
to
themselves
a
great
virtue
in
so
do
--
tell
each
other
what
an
absolute
necessity
there
be
,
for
the
public
good
,
that
it
should
be
do
;
and
then
,
with
loud
shout
and
cry
concern
the
vampyre
,
they
proceed
in
a
body
to
the
village
churchyard
,
where
have
be
lain
,
with
a
hope
of
repose
in
peace
,
the
bone
of
their
ancestor
.
 
<EOS>
a
specie
of
savage
ferocity
now
appear
to
have
seize
upon
the
crowd
,
and
the
people
,
in
make
up
their
mind
to
do
something
which
be
strikingly
at
variance
with
all
their
preconceived
notion
of
right
and
wrong
,
appear
to
feel
that
it
be
necessary
,
in
order
that
they
may
be
consistent
,
to
cast
off
many
of
the
decency
of
life
,
and
to
become
riotous
and
reckless
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
proceed
towards
the
graveyard
,
they
amuse
themselves
by
break
the
window
of
the
tax
-
gatherer
,
and
do
what
pass
mischief
they
could
to
the
habitation
of
all
who
hold
any
official
situation
or
authority
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
something
like
a
proclamation
of
war
against
those
who
may
think
it
their
duty
to
interfere
with
the
lawless
proceeding
of
an
ignorant
multitude
.
<EOS>
a
public
-
house
or
two
,
likewise
,
_
<EOS>
en
<EOS>
route

,
be
sack
of
some
of
its
inebriate
content
,
so
that
,
what
with
the
madness
of
intoxication
,
and
the
general
excitement
consequent
upon
the
very
nature
of
the
business
which
take
them
to
the
churchyard
,
a
more
wild
and
infuriate
multitude
than
that
which
pause
at
two
iron
gate
which
lead
into
the
sanctuary
of
that
church
could
not
be
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
those
who
have
never
see
a
mob
place
in
such
a
situation
as
to
have
cast
off
all
moral
restraint
<EOS>
whatever
,
at
the
same
time
that
it
feel
there
be
no
physical
power
to
cope
with
it
,
can
form
no
notion
of
the
mass
of
terrible
passion
which
lie
slumber
under
what
,
in
ordinary
case
,
have
appear
harmless
bosom
,
but
which
now
run
riot
,
and
overcome
every
principle
of
restraint
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
melancholy
fact
,
but
,
nevertheless
,
a
fact
,
despite
its
melancholy
,
that
,
even
in
a
civilised
country
like
this
,
with
a
generally
well
-
educate
population
,
nothing
but
a
well
-
organise
physical
force
keep
down
,
from
the
commission
of
the
most
outrageous
offence
,
hundred
and
thousand
of
person
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
say
that
the
mob
pause
at
the
iron
gate
of
the
churchyard
,
but
it
be
more
a
pause
of
surprise
than
one
of
vacillation
,
because
they
see
that
those
iron
gate
be
close
,
which
have
not
be
the
case
within
the
memory
of
the
old
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
first
building
of
the
church
,
and
the
enclosure
of
its
graveyard
,
two
pair
of
these
massive
gate
have
be
present
by
some
munificent
patron
;
but
,
after
a
time
,
they
hang
idly
upon
their
hinge
,
ornamental
certainly
,
but
useless
,
while
a
couple
of
turnstile
,
to
keep
cattle
from
stray
within
the
sacred
precinct
,
do
duty
instead
,
and
establish
,
without
trouble
,
the
regular
thoroughfare
,
which
long
habit
have
dictate
as
necessary
,
through
the
place
of
sepulture
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
those
gate
be
closed
,
and
for
once
be
do
duty
.
<EOS>
Heaven
only
know
how
they
have
be
move
upon
their
rusty
and
time
-
wear
hinge
.
<EOS>
the
mob
,
however
,
be
check
for
the
moment
,
and
it
be
clear
that
the
ecclesiastical
authority
be
resolve
to
attempt
something
to
prevent
the
desecration
of
the
tomb
.
 
<EOS>
those
gate
be
sufficiently
strong
to
resist
the
first
vigorous
shake
which
be
give
to
them
by
some
of
the
foremost
among
the
crowd
,
and
then
one
fellow
start
the
idea
that
they
may
be
open
from
the
inside
,
and
volunteer
to
clamber
over
the
wall
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
hoist
up
upon
the
shoulder
of
several
,
he
grasp
the
top
of
the
wall
,
and
raise
his
head
above
its
level
,
and
then
something
of
a
mysterious
nature
rise
up
from
the
inside
,
and
deal
him
such
a
whack
between
the
eye
,
that
down
he
go
sprawl
among
his
coadjutor
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
nobody
have
see
how
this
injury
have
be
inflict
,
and
the
policy
of
those
in
the
garrison
should
have
be
certainly
to
keep
up
the
mystery
,
and
leave
the
invader
in
ignorance
of
what
sort
of
person
it
be
that
have
so
foil
them
.
<EOS>
man
,
however
,
be
prone
to
indulge
in
vain
glorification
,
and
the
secret
be
explode
by
the
triumphant
wave
of
the
long
staff
of
the
beadle
,
with
the
gilt
knob
at
the
end
of
it
,
just
over
the
parapet
of
the
wall
,
in
token
of
victory

<EOS>
"
It

<EOS>
cry
everybody

it

<EOS>
"
yes

a
voice
from
within

it
be
Waggles

the

he
think

try
it
again

<EOS>
the
church
be
not
in
danger
;
<EOS>
oh

no

<EOS>
what
do
you
think
of
this
?
"
 
<EOS>
the
staff
be
flourish
more
vigorously
than
ever
,
and
in
the
secure
position
that
Waggles
occupy
it
seem
not
only
impossible
to
attack
him
,
but
that
he
possess
wonderful
power
of
resistance
,
for
the
staff
be
long
and
the
knob
be
heavy
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
boy
who
hit
upon
the
ingenious
expedient
of
throw
up
a
great
stone
,
so
that
it
just
fall
inside
the
wall
,
and
hit
Waggles
a
great
blow
on
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
the
staff
be
flourish
more
vigorously
than
ever
,
and
the
mob
,
in
the
ecstasy
at
the
fun
which
be
go
on
,
almost
forget
the
errand
which
have
bring
them
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
after
all
the
affair
may
have
pass
off
jestingly
,
have
not
there
be
some
really
mischievous
person
among
the
throng
who
be
determine
that
such
should
not
be
the
case
,
and
they
incite
the
multitude
to
commence
an
attack
upon
the
gate
,
which
in
a
few
moment
must
have
produce
their
entire
demolition
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
,
however
,
the
boldest
draw
back
,
and
there
be
a
pause
,
as
the
well
-
know
form
of
the
clergyman
appear
advance
from
the
church
door
,
attire
in
full
canonical

<EOS>
"
there
be
Mr.

several

"
how
unlucky

what

this

the

<EOS>
Can
I

I

<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
let
me
beseech

lose
not
a

return
to
your

repent

<EOS>
It

listen

I
pray
you

to
the
voice

often

prayer
to

upon

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
appeal
be
hear
respectfully
,
but
it
be
evidently
very
far
from
suit
the
feeling
and
the
wish
of
those
to
whom
it
be
address
;
the
presence
of
the

be
evidently
an
unexpected
circumstance

the
more
especially
too
as
he
appear
in
that
costume

they
have
be
accustom

a
reverence
almost
amount

veneration

<EOS>
He
see
the
favourable
effect

anxious

it
up

he

the
satisfaction

loud

upon
hastily

see

We

Waggles
spoilt

he

for
before
Mr.

could
utter
a

two

towards

Waggles

there

a
riot
of
a
most
formidable
description

<EOS>
a

of
desperation
seem
to
have

the

<EOS>
the
first
shovelful
of
earth
he
take
up
<EOS>
,
he
cast
over
his

into
the
air

so
that
it
fall
in
a
shower
among

which
of
course
raise
a
shout
of
indignation

and
,
as
he
continue
so
to
dispose
of
the
superfluous
earth
,
a
general
row
seem
likely
to
ensue
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fletcher
open
his
mouth
to
make
a
remark
,
and
,
as
that
feature
of
his
face
be
rather
a
capacious
one
,
a
descending
lump
of
mould
,
of
a
clayey
consistency
,
fall
into
it
,
and
get
so
wedge
among
his
tooth
,
that
in
the
process
of
extract
it
he
nearly
bring
some
of
those
essential
portion
of
his
anatomy
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
state
of
thing
that
could
not
last
long
,
and
he
who
have
be
so
liberal
with
his
spadesful
of
mould
be
speedily
disarm
,
and
yet
he
be
a
popular
favourite
,
and
have
do
the
thing
so
good
-
humouredly
,
that
nobody
touch
him
.
<EOS>
six
or
eight
other
,
who
have
bring
spade
and
pickaxe
,
now
push
forward
to
the
work
,
and
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
the
grave
of
Miles
,
the
butcher
,
seem
to
be
very
nearly
excavate
.
 
<EOS>
work
of
any
kind
or
nature
<EOS>
whatever
,
be
speedily
execute
when
do
with
a
wish
to
get
through
it
;
and
never
,
perhaps
,
within
the
memory
of
man
,
be
a
grave
open
in
that
churchyard
with
such
a
wonderful
celerity
.
<EOS>
the
excitement
of
the
crowd
grow
intense
--
every
available
spot
from
which
a
view
of
the
grave
could
be
get
,
be
occupy
;
for
the
last
few
minute
scarcely
a
remark
have
be
utter
,
and
when
,
at
last
,
the
spade
of
one
of
those
who
be
dig
strike
upon
something
that
sound
like
wood
,
you
may
have
hear
a
pin
drop
,
and
each
one
there
present
draw
his
breath
more
shortly
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
he
be
,
"
say
the
man
,
whose
spade
strike
upon
the
coffin
.
 
<EOS>
those
few
word
break
the
spell
,
and
there
be
a
general
murmur
,
while
every
individual
present
seem
to
shift
his
position
in
his
anxiety
to
obtain
a
well
view
of
what
be
about
to
ensue
.
 
<EOS>
the
coffin
now
have
be
once
find
,
there
seem
to
be
an
increase
impetus
give
to
the
work
;
the
earth
be
throw
out
with
a
rapidity
that
seem
almost
the
quick
result
of
the
working
of
some
machine
;
and
those
close
to
the
grave
's
brink
crouch
down
,
and
,
intent
as
they
be
upon
the
progress
of
event
,
heed
not
the
damp
earth
that
fall
upon
them
,
nor
the
frail
brittle
and
humid
remain
of
humanity
that
occasionally
roll
to
their
foot
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
,
indeed
,
a
scene
of
intense
excitement
--
a
scene
which
only
want
a
few
prominent
feature
in
its
foreground
of
a
more
intellectual
and
high
cast
than
compose
the
mob
,
to
make
it
a
fit
theme
for
a
painter
of
the
high
talent
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
the
last
few
shovelful
of
earth
that
hide
the
top
of
the
coffin
be
cast
from
the
grave
,
and
that
narrow
house
which
contain
the
mortal
remain
of
him
who
be
so
well
known
,
while
in
life
,
to
almost
every
one
then
present
,
be
bring
to
the
gaze
of
eye
which
never
have
seem
likely
to
have
look
upon
him
again
.
 
<EOS>
the
cry
be
now
for
rope
,
with
which
to
raise
the
cumbrous
mass
;
but
these
be
not
to
be
have
,
no
one
thought
of
provide
himself
with
such
appliance
,
so
that
by
main
strength
,
only
,
could
the
coffin
be
raise
to
the
brink
.
 
<EOS>
the
difficulty
of
do
this
be
immense
,
for
there
be
nothing
tangible
to
stand
upon
;
and
even
when
the
mould
from
the
side
be
sufficiently
clear
away
,
that
the
handle
of
the
coffin
could
be
lay
hold
of
<EOS>
,
they
come
away
immediately
in
the
grasp
of
those
who
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
more
trouble
that
present
itself
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
design
of
the
mob
,
the
more
intent
that
body
seem
upon
carry
out
to
the
full
extent
their
original
design
.
 
<EOS>
find
it
quite
impossible
by
bodily
strength
to
raise
the
coffin
of
the
butcher
from
the
position
in
which
it
have
get
imbed
by
excessive
rain
,
a
boy
be
hastily
despatch
to
the
village
for
rope
,
and
never
do
boy
run
with
such
speed
before
,
for
all
his
own
curiosity
be
excite
in
the
issue
of
an
adventure
,
that
to
his
young
imagination
be
appallingly
interesting
.
 
<EOS>
as
impatient
as
mob
usually
be
,
<EOS>
they
have
not
time
,
in
this
case
,
for
the
exercise
of
that
quality
of
mind
before
the
boy
come
back
with
the
necessary
mean
of
exert
quite
a
different
specie
of
power
against
the
butcher
's
coffin
.
 
<EOS>
strong
rope
be
slide
under
the
inert
mass
,
and
twenty
hand
at
once
ply
the
task
of
raise
that
receptacle
of
the
dead
from
what
have
be
presume
to
be
its
last
resting
-
place
.
<EOS>
the
rope
strain
and
creak
,
and
many
thought
that
they
would
burst
asunder
sooner
than
raise
the
heavy
coffin
of
the
defunct
butcher
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
singular
what
reason
people
find
for
back
their
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
depend
he
be
a
vampyre
,
"
say
one
,
"
or
it
would
not
be
so
difficult
to
get
him
out
of
the
grave
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
there
can
be
no
mistake
about
that
,
"
say
one
;
"
when
do
a
natural
Christian
's
coffin
stick
in
the
mud
in
that
way
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
to
be
sure
,
"
say
another
;
"
I
know
no
good
would
come
of
his
going
on
;
he
never
be
a
decent
sort
of
man
like
his
neighbour

and
many
queer
thing
have
be
say
of
him
that
I
have
no
doubt
<EOS>
be
true
enough

if
we
do

know
the
right

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
but
,
"
say
a
young
lad
,
thrust
his
head
between
the
two
who
be
talk
,
"
if
he
be
a
vampyre
,
how
do
he
get
out
of
his
coffin
of
a
night
with
all
that
weight
of
mould
a
top
of
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
one
of
the
man
consider
for
a
moment
,
and
then
find
no
rational
answer
occur
to
him
,
he
give
the
boy
a
box
on
the
ear
,
<EOS>
saying,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
know

<EOS>
boy
,
now
-
a

day
,
be
not
like
the

in
my

they
think
nothing
now
of
put
their

in

up
people

wheel
,
just
as
if
their
opinion
be
of
any
consequence

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
now
,
by
a
vigorous
effort
,
those
who
be
tug
at
the
rope
succeed
in
move
the
coffin
a
little
,
and
that
first
step
be
all
the
difficulty
,
for
it
be
loosen
from
the
adhesive
soil
in
which
it
lie
,
and
now
come
up
with
considerable
facility
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
half
shout
of
satisfaction
at
this
result
,
while
some
of
the
congregation
turn
pale
,
and
tremble
at
the
prospect
of
the
sight
which
be
about
to
present
itself
;
the
coffin
be
drag
from
the
grave
's
brink
fairly
among
the
long
rank
grass
that
flourish
in
the
churchyard
,
and
then
they
all
look
at
it
for
a
time
,
and
the
man
who
have
be
most
earnest
in
raise
it
wipe
the
perspiration
from
their
brow
,
and
seem
to
shrink
from
the
task
of
open
that
receptacle
of
the
dead
now
that
it
be
fairly
in
their
power
so
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
each
man
look
anxiously
in
his
neighbour
's
face
,
and
several
audibly
wonder
why
somebody
else
do
not
open
the
coffin
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
harm
in
it
,
"
say
one
;
"
if
he
be
a
vampyre
,
we
ought
to
know
it
;
and
,
if
he
be
not

we
can
not
do
any
hurt
to
a
dead
man

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ought
not
we
to
have
the
service
for
the

one

<EOS>
"
yes

"
say
the
impertinent
boy
who
have
before
receive
the
knock
on
the

"
I
think
we
ought
to
have

read
backwards

"
 
<EOS>
this
ingenious
idea
be
recompense
by
a
great
many
kick
and
cuff
,
which
ought
to
have
be
sufficient
to
have
warn
him
of
the
great
danger

"
where

cry
he
who

be
so
active
in
shovel
the
mud
upon
the
multitude
;
"
why

you
cowardly
sneak
set
of
humbug

you
be
half
afraid

afraid

everybody

"
ah

<EOS>
at
this
moment

the
man

raise
a
horrible

the
little

at

into

while
the
mob
,
with
one
accord
,
turn
tail
,
and
flee
in
all
direction
,
leave
him
alone
with

such
a
fighting

kick
,

scramble
ensue
to
get
over

that

burst
into
such
peal

laughter
that
the

aware

sheepish

some

up
very
faint

<EOS>
again?--that
be
what
I
use
to
call
him
;
and
then
he
use
to
request
me
to
go
down
below
,
where
I
need
not

round
to
light
my

<EOS>
He
introduce
the
corner
of
a
shovel
between

lid
and
the
coffin

and
give
it
a
sudden
wrench
,
he
loosen
it
all
down

<EOS>
a
shudder
pervade
the
multitude

,
popularly

,
you
may
have
hear
a
pin
drop
in

crowd
churchyard
at

Dick

Dick
throw
down

he
lift
it
off

fling
it
on
one
side

<EOS>
there
be
a
visible
movement

an
exclamation
among
the
multitude

<EOS>
some
be
push
down
,
in
the
eager
desire
of
those
behind
to
obtain
a
sight
of
the
ghastly
remain
of
the
butcher

those
at
a
distance
be
frantic
,

the
excitement
be
momentarily
increase
.
 
<EOS>
They
may
all
have
spare
themselves
the
trouble
,
for
the
coffin

here
be
no
dead
butcher

nor
any
evidence
of
one
ever
have
be
there
,
not
even
the
grave

clothe
;
the
only
thing
at
all
in
the
receptacle
of
the
dead
be
a
brick

Dick
's
astonishment
be
so
intense
that
his
eye
and
mouth
keep
open
together
to
such
an
extent
,
that
it
seem
doubtful
when
they
would
reach
their
extreme
point
of
elongation
.
<EOS>
He
then
take
up
the
brick
and
look
at
it
curiously
,
and
turn
it
over
and
over
,
examine
the
end
and
the
side
with
a
critical
eye
,
and
at
length
he
said,--

"
well

I

a
transmogrification

consolidifie
himself
into

my

here
be
a
curiosity

"
 
<EOS>
"
but
you
do
not
mean
to
say
that
be
the
butcher
,

say
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
Dick
reach
over
,
and
give
him
a
tap
on
the
head
with
the
brick
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
!
"
he
say
,
"
that
be
what
I
call
occular
demonstration

do
you
believe
it
now

what

more
natural

<EOS>
"
give
it
to
me

I
should
like

just
for

<EOS>

I
will
see
you
turn
into

I
sha'n't

with
this
here
<EOS>
,
it
look
so
blessed
sensible

it

remarkable

<EOS>
by
this
time
the
bewilderment
of
the
mob
have
subside
;
now
that
there
be
no
dead
butcher
to
look
upon
,
they
fancy
themselves
most
grievously
injure
;
and
,
somehow
or
other
,
Dick
,
notwithstanding
all
his
exertion
in
their
service
,
be
look
upon
in
the
light
of
a
showman
,
who
have
promise
some
startling
exhibition
and
then
have
disappoint
his
auditor
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
intimation
he
have
of
popular
vengeance
be
a
stone
throw
at
him
,
but
Dick
's
eye
happen
to
be
upon
the
fellow
who
throw
it
,
and
collar
him
in
a
moment
,
he
deal
him
a
cuff
on
the
side
of
the
head
,
which
confuse
his
faculty
for
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hark
ye
,
"
he
then
cry
,
with
a
loud
voice
,
"
do
not
interfere
with
me
;
you
know
it
will
not
go
down
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
wrong
here
;
and
,
as
one
of
yourself
,
I
be
as
much
interested
in
find
out
what
it
be
as
any
of
you
can
possibly
be
.
<EOS>
there
seem
to
be
some
truth
in
this
vampyre
business
;
our
old
friend
,
the
butcher
,
you
see
,
be
not
in
his
grave
;
where
be
he
then
?
"
 
<EOS>
the
mob
look
at
each
other
,
and
none
attempt
to
answer
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
of
course
,
he
be
a
vampyre
,
"
say
Dick
,
"
and
you
may
all
of
you
expect
to
see
him

in
turn

come
into
your
bed

window
with

"
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
general
expression
of
horror
,

then
Dick
continued,--

"
You
would
better
all

you
go
home
;
I

have
no

let
's
see
how
many
vampyre
there
be
in
the
churchyard

<EOS>
"
well
,
it
be
no
business
of
mine

say
Dick
;

I
would
not

<EOS>
"
You
may
depend

say
one
,

that
Dick
know
something
about
it

he
would
not

it
so
easy

"
ah

down
with
him

the
man
who
have
receive
the
box
on

he
be
perhaps
a
vampyre
himself

<EOS>
the
mob
make
a
demonstration
towards
him
,
but
Dick
stand
his
ground
,
and
they
pause
again
.

"
now
,
you
be
a
cowardly
set

;

cause

you
want
to
come
upon

<EOS>
now
,
I
will
just
show
what
a
little
thing
will
frighten
you
all
again

I
warn
beforehand

you
sha'n't

the

look
at

wonder
what
he
be
go
to
do

<EOS>
"
once

twice

<EOS>
he
say
,
and
then
he
fling
the
brick
up
into
the
air
an
immense
height
,
and
shout

in
a
loud
tone

<EOS>
a
general
dispersion
of

crowd
ensue
,

the
brick
fall
in
the
centre
of
a
very
large
circle
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
you

act
you

say
the
boy
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
famous
coffin

this

he
lay
himself
down
in
the
butcher

last
resting

place

never

get
your

into
some
hole
one

not

"
now
,
listen
to
me

good
people
all
,

add
Dick
;
"
I
have
really
get
something
to
say
to
you

<EOS>
at
this
intimation
the
people
slowly
gather
again
round
the
grave

listen
,
"

solemnly

;

it
strike
me
there
be
some
tremendous
do
go
on

"
yes

several
who
be
foremost

It

astonish

me
beg
of
<EOS>
all
you
not
to
accuse
me

have
anything
to
do
with
it

provide
I
tell

no

we
won't

<EOS>
we
won't

we
will
not

<EOS>
"
good
;
then
,
listen
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
anything
,
but
I
will
tell
you
what
I
think
,
and
that
be
as
good
<EOS>
;
I
do
not
think
that
this
brick
be
the
butcher
;
but
I
think
,
that
when
you
least
expect
it
--
hush
!
<EOS>
come
a
little
close
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
;
we
be
close
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
I
say
,
when
you
all
least
expect
it
,
and
when
you
be
not
dream
of
such
a
thing
,
you
will
hear
something
of
my
fat
friend
as
be
dead
and
go
,
that
will
astonish
you
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
Dick
pause
,
and
he
give
the
coffin
a
slight
kick
,
as
intimation
to
the
boy
that
he
may
as
well
be
do
his
part
in
the
drama
,
upon
which
that
ingenious
young
gentleman
set
up
such
a
howl
,
that
even
Dick
jump
,
so
unearthly
do
it
sound
within
the
confine
of
that
receptacle
of
the
dead
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
the
effect
upon
him
be
great
,
what
must
it
have
be
upon
those
whom
it
take
completely
unawares
?
<EOS>
for
a
moment
or
two
they
seem
completely
paralysed
,
and
then
they
frighten
the
boy
,
for
the
shout
of
terror
that
rise
from
so
many
throat
at
once
be
positively
alarming
.
 
<EOS>
this
jest
of
Dick
's
be
final
,
for
,
before
three
minute
have
elapse
,
the
churchyard
be
clear
of
all
human
occupant
save
himself
and
the
boy
,
who
have
play
his
part
so
well
in
the
coffin
.
 
<EOS>
"
get
out
,
"
say
Dick
,
"
it
be
all
right
<EOS>
--
we've
do
'em
at
last
;
and
now
you
may
depend
upon
it
they
will
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
come
here
again
.
<EOS>
You
keep
your
own
counsel
,
or
else
somebody
will
serve
you
out
for
this
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
you
be
altogether
averse
to
a
bit
of
fun
,
and
if
you
keep
yourself
quiet
,
you
will
have
the
satisfaction
of
hear
what

<EOS>
It
seem
now
,
that
,
by
the
concurrence
of
all
party
,
Bannerworth
Hall
be
to
be
abandon
;
and
,
notwithstanding
Henry
be
loth
--
as
he
have
,
indeed
,
from
the
first
show
himself
--
to
leave
the
ancient
abode
of
his
race
,
yet
,
as
not
only
Flora
,
but
the
admiral
and
his
friend
Mr.
Chillingworth
seem
to
be
of
opinion
that
it
would
be
a
prudent
course
to
adopt
,
he
feel
that
it
would
not
become
him
to
oppose
the
measure
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
now
make
his
consent
to
depend
wholly
upon
the
full
and
free
acquiescence
of
every
member
of
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
,
"
he
say
,
"
there
be
any
among
us
who
will
say
to
me
'
continue
to
keep
open
the
house
in
which
we
have
pass
so
many
happy
hour
,
and
let
the
ancient
home
of
our
race
still
afford
a
shelter
to
us
,
'
I
shall
feel
myself
bind
to
do
so
;
but
if
both
my
mother
and
my
brother
agree
to
a
departure
from
it
,
and
that
its
hearth
shall
be
leave
cold
and
desolate
,
be
it
so
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
stand
in
the
way
of
any
unanimous
wish
or
arrangement
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
may
consider
that
,
then
,
as
settle
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
"
for
I
have
speak
to
your
brother
,
and
he
be
of
our
opinion
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
my
boy
,
we
may
all
be
off
as
soon
as
we
can
conveniently
get
under
weigh
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
my
mother
?
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
there
,
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
You
must
speak
to
her
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
never
,
if
I
can
help
it
,
interfere
with
the
woman
folk
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
she
consent
,
then
I
be
willing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
ask
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
ask
her
to
leave
,
because
I
know
,
then
,
what
answer
she
would
at
once
give
;
but
she
shall
hear
the
proposition
,
and
I
will
leave
her
to
decide
upon
it
,
unbiased
in
her
judgment
by
any
stated
opinion
of
mine
upon
the
matter
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
good
.
<EOS>
that
will
do
;
and
the
proper
way
to
put
it
,
too
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
mistake
about
that
,
I
can
tell
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Henry
,
although
he
go
through
the
ceremony
of
consult
his
mother
,
have
no
sort
of
doubt
before
he
do
so
that
she
be
sufficiently
aware
of
the
feeling
and
wish
of
Flora
to
be
prepared
to
yield
a
ready
assent
to
the
proposition
of
leave
the
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
moreover
,
Mr.
Marchdale
have
,
from
the
first
,
be
an
advocate
of
such
a
course
of
proceeding
,
and
Henry
well
know
how
strong
an
influence
he
have
over
Mrs.
Bannerworth
's
mind
,
in
consequence
of
the
respect
in
which
she
hold
him
as
an
old
and
value
friend
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
,
therefore
,
prepare
for
what
his
mother
say
,
which
was,--
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Henry
,
you
know
that
the
wish
of
my
child
,
since
they
have
be
grow
up
and
capable
of
come
to
a
judgment
for
themselves
,
have
ever
be
law
to
me
.
<EOS>
if
you
,
among
you
all
,
agree
to
leave
this
place
,
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
will
you
leave
it
freely
,
mother
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
most
freely
I
go
with
you
all
;
what
be
it
that
have
make
this
house
and
all
its
appurtenance
pleasant
in
my
eye
,
but
the
presence
in
it
of
those
who
be
so
dear
to
me
?
<EOS>
if
you
all
leave
it
,
you
take
with
you
the
only
charm
it
ever
possess
;
so
it
become
in
itself
as
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
ready
to
accompany
you
all
anywhere
,
so
that
we
do
but
keep
together
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
,
mother
,
we
may
consider
that
as
settle
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
It
be
scarcely
as
I
please
.
<EOS>
I
must
confess
that
I
would
fain
have
cling
with
a
kind
of
superstitious
reverence
to
this
ancient
abiding
-
place
of
my
race
,
but
it
may
not
be
so
.
<EOS>
those
,
perchance
,
who
be
more
practically
able
to
come
to
correct
conclusion
,
in
consequence
of
their
feeling
not
be
sufficiently
interested
to
lead
them
astray
,
have
decide
otherwise
;
and
,
therefore
,
I
be
content
to
leave
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
do
not
grieve
at
it
,
Henry
.
<EOS>
there
have
hang
a
cloud
of
misfortune
over
us
all
since
the
garden
of
this
house
become
the
scene
of
an
event
which
we
can
none
of
us
remember
but
with
terror
and
shuddering
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
two
generation
of
our
family
must
live
and
die
before
the
remembrance
of
that
circumstance
can
be
obliterate
.
<EOS>
but
we
will
think
of
it
no
more
.
"
 
<EOS>
there
can
no
doubt
but
that
the
dreadful
circumstance
to
which
both
Mrs.
Bannerworth
and
Henry
allude
,
be
the
suicide
of
the
father
of
the
family
in
the
garden
which
before
have
be
hint
at
in
the
course
of
this
narration
,
as
be
a
circumstance
which
have
create
a
great
sensation
at
the
time
,
and
cast
a
great
gloom
for
many
month
over
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
the
reader
will
,
doubtless
,
too
,
recollect
that
,
at
his
last
moment
,
this
unhappy
individual
be
say
to
have
utter
some
incoherent
word
about
some
hide
money
,
and
that
the
rapid
hand
of
death
alone
seem
to
prevent
him
from
be
explicit
upon
that
subject
,
and
leave
it
merely
a
matter
of
conjecture
.
 
<EOS>
as
year
have
roll
on
,
this
affair
,
even
as
a
subject
of
speculation
,
have
cease
to
occupy
the
mind
of
any
of
the
Bannerworth
family
,
and
several
of
their
friend
,
among
whom
be
Mr.
Marchdale
,
be
decidedly
of
opinion
that
the
apparently
pointed
and
mysterious
word
utter
,
be
but
the
disorder
wandering
of
an
intellect
already
hover
on
the
confine
of
eternity
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
far
from
any
money
,
of
any
amount
,
be
a
disturbance
to
the
last
moment
of
the
dissolute
man
,
whose
vice
and
extravagance
have
bring
his
family
,
to
such
ruin
,
it
be
pretty
generally
believe
that
he
have
commit
suicide
simply
from
a
conviction
of
the
impossibility
of
raise
any
more
supply
of
cash
,
to
enable
him
to
carry
on
the
career
which
he
have
pursue
for
so
long
.
 
<EOS>
but
to
resume
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
at
once
communicate
to
the
admiral
what
his
mother
have
say
,
and
then
the
whole
question
regard
the
removal
be
settle
in
the
affirmative
,
nothing
remain
to
be
do
but
to
set
about
it
as
quickly
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
the
Bannerworths
live
sufficiently
distant
from
the
town
to
be
out
of
earshot
of
the
disturbance
which
be
then
take
place
;
and
so
completely
isolate
be
they
from
all
sort
of
society
,
that
they
have
no
notion
of
the
popular
disturbance
which
Varney
the
vampyre
have
give
rise
to
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
the
follow
morning
that
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
who
have
be
home
in
the
meantime
,
bring
word
of
what
have
take
place
,
and
that
great
commotion
be
still
in
the
town
,
and
that
the
civil
authority
,
find
themselves
by
far
too
weak
to
contend
against
the
popular
will
,
have
send
for
assistance
to
a
garrison
town
,
some
twenty
mile
distant
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
grief
to
the
Bannerworth
family
to
hear
these
tiding
,
not
that
they
be
in
any
way
,
except
as
victim
,
accessory
to
create
the
disturbance
about
the
vampyre
,
but
it
seem
to
promise
a
kind
of
notoriety
which
they
may
well
shrink
from
,
and
which
they
be
just
the
people
to
view
with
dislike
.
 
<EOS>
view
the
matter
how
we
like
,
however
,
it
be
not
to
be
consider
as
at
all
probable
that
the
Bannerworth
family
would
remain
long
in
ignorance
of
what
a
great
sensation
<EOS>
they
have
create
unwittingly
in
the
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
the
very
reason
which
have
induce
their
servant
to
leave
their
establishment
,
and
prefer
throw
themselves
completely
out
of
place
,
rather
than
remain
in
so
ill
-
omen
a
house
,
be
sure
to
be
bruit
abroad
far
and
wide
.
 
<EOS>
and
that
,
perhaps
,
when
they
come
to
consider
of
it
,
would
suffice
to
form
another
good
and
substantial
reason
for
leave
the
Hall
,
and
seek
a
refuge
in
obscurity
from
the
extremely
troublesome
sort
of
popularity
incidental
to
their
peculiar
situation
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Chillingworth
feel
uncommonly
chary
of
tell
them
all
that
have
take
place
;
although
he
be
well
aware
that
the
proceeding
of
the
riotous
mob
have
not
terminate
with
the
little
disappointment
at
the
old
ruin
,
to
which
they
have
so
effectually
chase
Varney
the
vampyre
,
but
to
lose
him
so
singularly
when
he
get
there
.
 
<EOS>
no
doubt
he
possess
the
admiral
with
the
uproar
that
be
go
on
in
the
town
,
for
the
latter
do
hint
a
little
of
it
to
Henry
Bannerworth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hilloa
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
to
Henry
,
as
he
see
him
walk
in
the
garden
;
"
it
strike
me
if
you
and
your
ship
's
crew
continue
in
these
latitude
,
you
will
get
as
notorious
as
the
Flying
Dutchman
in
the
southern
ocean
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
mean
?
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
it
be
a
sure
go
proverb
to
say
,
that
a
nod
be
as
good
as
a
wink
;
but
,
the
fact
be
,
it
be
get
rather
too
well
known
to
be
pleasant
,
that
a
vampyre
have
strike
up
rather
a
close
acquaintance
with
your
family
.
<EOS>
I
understand
there
be
a
precious
row
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
bother
the
particular
,
for
I
do
not
know
them
;
but
,
hark
ye
,
by
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
will
have
find
a
place
for
you
to
go
to
<EOS>
,
so
pack
up
the
stick
,
get
all
your
store
ready
to
clear
out
,
and
make
yourself
scarce
from
this
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
understand
you
,
"
say
Henry
;
"
We
have
become
the
subject
of
popular
rumour
;
I
have
only
to
beg
of
you
,
admiral
,
that
you
will
say
nothing
of
this
to
Flora
;
she
have
already
suffer
enough
,
Heaven
know
;
do
not
let
her
have
the
additional
infliction
of
think
that
her
name
be
make
familiar
in
every
pothouse
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
leave
me
alone
for
that
,
"
say
the
admiral
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
you
think
I
be
an
ass
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
,
"
say
Jack
Pringle
,
who
come
in
at
that
moment
,
and
think
the
question
be
address
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
who
speak
to
you
,
you
bad
-
look
horse
-
marine
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Me
a
horse
-
marine
!
<EOS>
do
not
you
ask
a
plain
question
of
a
fellow
,
and
get
a
plain
answer
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
son
of
a
bad
look
gun
,
what
do
you
mean
by
that
?
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
it
be
,
Jack
;
I
have
let
you
come
sneak
too
often
on
the
quarter
-
deck
,
and
now
you
come
poke
your
fun
at
your
officer
,
you
rascal
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
poke
fun
!
"
<EOS>
say
Jack
;
"
could
not
think
of
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
I
should
just
as
soon
think
of
you
make
a
joke
as
me

"
 
<EOS>
"
now
,
I
tell
you
what
it
be

I
shall
just
strike
you
off
the
ship
's
book

you
shall
just
go
and
cruise
by
yourself

I
have
do
with
you
.

<EOS>
"
go
and
tell
that
to
the
marines
,
if
you
like

Jack

"
I
be
not

with
you

for
a
jolly
long
watch

great
babby

without

convey
you
from

of
difficulty

my

<EOS>
"
ay

you
may
do
what
you
like
with
your

you
will
not

sartingly
not

come
here
,
then
?

<EOS>
Jack
may
have
expect
a
gratuity
,
for
he
advance
with
alacrity
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
as
he
lay
his
stick
across
his
shoulder
;
"
that
be
your
last
month
's
wage
;
do
not
spend
it
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
be
d----d
!
<EOS>
"
say
Jack
;
"
who
'd
have
think
of
that?--he
be
a
turning
rumgumtious
,
and
no
mistake
.
<EOS>
howsomdever
,
I
must
turn
it
over
in
my
mind
,
and
be
even
with
him
,
somehow
<EOS>
--
I
owe
him
one
for
that
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
admiral
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
now
,
you
lubber
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
nothing
;
turn
that
over
in
your
mind
;
"
and
away
Jack
walk
,
not
quite
satisfied
,
but
feel
,
at
least
,
that
he
have
make
a
demonstration
of
attack
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
the
admiral
,
he
consider
that
the
thump
he
have
give
Jack
with
the
stick
,
and
it
be
no
gentle
one
,
be
a
decide
balancing
of
account
up
to
that
period
,
and
as
he
remain
likewise
master
of
the
field
,
he
be
upon
the
whole
very
well
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
these
last
few
word
which
have
be
speak
to
Henry
by
Admiral
Bell
,
more
than
any
other
,
induce
him
to
hasten
his
departure
from
Bannerworth
Hall
;
he
have
walk
away
when
the
altercation
between
Jack
Pringle
and
the
admiral
begin
,
for
he
have
see
sufficient
of
those
wordy
conflict
between
those
original
to
be
quite
satisfied
that
neither
of
them
mean
what
he
say
of
a
discouraging
character
towards
the
other
,
and
that
far
from
there
be
any
unfriendly
feel
contingent
upon
those
little
affair
,
they
be
only
a
species
of
friendly
sparring
,
which
both
party
enjoy
extremely
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
direct
to
Flora
,
and
he
say
to
her,--
 
"
since
we
be
all
agree
upon
the
necessity
,
or
,
at
all
event
,
upon
the
expediency
of
a
departure
from
the
Hall
,
I
think
,
sister
,
<EOS>
the
sooner
we
carry
out
that
determination
the
well
and
the
pleasanter
<EOS>
for
us
all
it
will
be
.
<EOS>
do
you
think
you
could
remove
so
hastily
as
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
to
-
morrow
!
<EOS>
that
be
soon
indeed
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
grant
you
that
it
be
so
;
but
Admiral
Bell
assure
me
that
he
will
have
everything
in
readiness
,
and
a
place
provide
for
us
to
go
to
by
then
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Would
it
be
possible
to
remove
from
a
house
like
this
so
very
quickly
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sister
.
<EOS>
if
you
look
around
you
,
you
will
see
that
a
great
portion
of
the
comfort
you
enjoy
in
this
mansion
belong
to
it
as
a
part
of
its
very
structure
,
and
be
not
removable
at
pleasure
;
what
we
really
have
to
take
away
be
very
little
.
<EOS>
the
urgent
want
of
money
during
our
father
's
lifetime
induce
him
,
as
you
may
recollect
even
,
at
various
time
to
part
with
much
that
be
ornamental
,
as
well
as
useful
,
which
be
in
the
Hall
.
<EOS>
You
will
recollect
that
we
seldom
return
from
those
little
continental
tour
which
to
us
be
so
delightful
,
without
find
some
old
familiar
object
go
,
which
,
upon
inquiry
,
we
find
have
be
turn
into
money
,
to
meet
some
more
than
usually
press
demand
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
,
brother
;
I
recollect
well
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
that
,
upon
the
whole
,
sister
,
there
be
little
to
remove
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
be
it
so
.
<EOS>
I
will
prepare
our
mother
for
this
sudden
step
.
<EOS>
believe
me
,
my
heart
go
with
it
;
and
as
a
force
of
vengeful
circumstance
have
induce
us
to
remove
from
this
home
,
which
be
once
so
full
of
pleasant
recollection
,
it
be
certainly
well
,
as
you
say
,
that
the
act
should
be
at
once
consummate
,
than
leave
hang
in
terror
over
our
mind
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
consider
that
as
settle

<EOS>
Mrs.
Bannerworth
's
consent
have
be
already
give
to
the
removal
,
she
say
at
once
,
when
appeal
to
,
that
she
be
quite
ready
to
go
at
any
time
her
child
think
expedient
.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
,
Henry
seek
the
admiral
,
and
tell
him
as
much
,
at
the
same
time
<EOS>
adding,--
 
<EOS>
"
My
sister
fear
that
we
should
have
considerable
trouble
in
the
removal
,
but
I
have
convince
her
that
such
will
not
be
the
case
,
as
we
be
by
no
means
overburden
with
cumbrous
property
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
cumbrous
property
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
"
why
,
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
I
beg
leave
to
say
,
that
when
I
take
the
house
,
I
take
the
table
and
chair
with
it
.
<EOS>
d
--
<EOS>
n
it
,
what
good
<EOS>
do
you
suppose
an
empty
house
be
to
me
?

"
 
<EOS>
"
the
table
and
chair
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
I
take
the
house
just
as
it
stand
.
<EOS>
do
not
try
and
bamboozle
me
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
you
have
nothing
to
move
<EOS>
but
yourself
and
immediate
personal
effect
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
aware
,
admiral
,
that
that
be
your
plan
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
now
you
be
,
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
circumvent
the
enemy
too
often
not

know
how
to
get
up
a
plot
.
<EOS>
Jack
and
I
have
manage
it
all

<EOS>
to

Miss
Flora

will
come
out
of
the
house
,

Jack
and

lead
you
where
you

to
go
to

<EOS>
there
be
plenty
of
furniture
where
you

go

so
you
will
get
off
free

without
anybody
know
anything
about
it

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
admiral
,
I
have
say
it
before

the
unanimous
opinion

I

that

at

I

may

"
 
the
admiral
's
calmness
during
the
latter
part
of
the
dialogue
arise
from
the
fact
that
over
the
flunkey
's
shoulder
,
and
at
some
little
distance
off
,
he
see
Jack
Pringle
take
off
his
jacket
,
and
roll
up
his
sleeve
in
that
deliberate
sort
of
way
that
seem
to
imply
a
determination
of
set
about
some
specie
of
work
that
combine
the
pleasant
with
the
useful
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
execute
many
nod
to
and
wink
at
the
livery
-
servant
,
and
jerk
his
thumb
likewise
in
the
direction
of
a
pump
near
at
hand
,
in
a
manner
that
speak
as
plainly
as
possible
,
that
John
be
to
be
pump
upon
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
the
conference
be
end
,
and
Sir
Francis
's
messenger
turn
to
go
;
but
Jack
Pringle
bother
him
completely
,
for
he
dance
round
him
in
such
a
singular
manner
,
<EOS>
that
,
turn
which
way
<EOS>
he
would
,
there
stand
Jack
Pringle
,
in
some
grotesque
attitude
,
intercept
him
;
and
so
he
edge
him
on
,
till
he
get
him
to
the
pump
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jack

say
the
admiral
.
 
<EOS>
"
ay

ay
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
pump
on
that
fellow
now

"
 
"
ay
,
ay
,
sir
;
give
us
a
hand

<EOS>
Jack
lay
hold
of
him
by
the
two
ear
,
and
hold
him
under
the
pump
,
kick
his
shin
until
he
completely
gather
himself
beneath
the
spout
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
that
he
shout
"
murder

<EOS>
help
!
<EOS>
fire
!
<EOS>
thief

"
<EOS>
Jack
be
inexorable
,
and
the
admiral
pump

<EOS>
Jack
turn
the
fellow
's
head
about
in
a
very
scientific
manner
,
so
as
to
give
him
a
fair
dose
of
hydropathic
treatment
,
and
in
a
few
minute
,
never
be
human
be
more
thoroughly
saturate
with
moisture
than
be
Sir
Francis
Varney
's
servant

<EOS>
He
have
leave
off
halloo
for
aid
,
for
he
find
that
whenever
he
do
so
,
Jack
hold
his
mouth
under
the
spout
,
which
be
decidedly
unpleasant
;
so
,
with
a
patience
that
look
like
heroic
fortitude
,
he
be
compel
to
wait
until
the
admiral
be
tired
of
pump

<EOS>
"
very
good

at
length
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
now
,
Jack

for
fear
this
fellow
catcher
cold

be
so
good
as

get
a
horsewhip

see
him
off
the
premise

it

<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay

Jack
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
say
,
old
fellow
,
you
can
take
back
all
our
blessed
compliment
now
,
and
say
you
have
be
flurry
a
little
yourself
;
<EOS>
and
if
so
be
as
you
come
here
as
dry
as
dust
,
d----e
,
you
go
back
as
wet
as
a
mop
.
<EOS>
will
not
it
do
to
kick
him
out
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
well
--
as
you
please
,
Jack
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
here
go
;
"
and
Jack
proceed
to
kick
the
shivering
animal
from
the
garden
with
a
vehemence
that
soon
convince
him
of
the
necessity
of
get
out
of
it
as
quickly
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
how
it
be
that
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
after
the
fearful
race
he
have
have
,
get
home
again
across
the
field
,
free
from
all
danger
,
and
back
to
his
own
house
,
from
whence
he
send
so
cool
and
insolent
a
message
,
they
could
not
conceive
.
 
<EOS>
but
such
must
certainly
be
the
fact
;
somehow
or
another
,
he
have
escape
all
danger
,
and
,
with
a
calm
insolence
peculiar
to
the
man
,
he
have
no
doubt
adopt
the
present
mode
of
signify
as
much
to
the
Bannerworths
.
 
<EOS>
the
insolence
of
his
servant
be
,
no
doubt
,
a
matter
of
pre
-
arrangement
with
that
individual
,
however
he
may
have
set
about
it
<EOS>
con
amore
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
termination
of
the
adventure
,
that
,
of
course
,
have
not
be
at
all
calculate
upon
;
but
,
like
most
tool
of
other
people
's
insolence
or
ambition
,
the
insolence
of
the
underling
have
receive
both
his
own
punishment
and
his
master
's
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
quite
enough
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
to
feel
assured
that
he
would
rather
consider
it
as
a
good
jest
than
otherwise
of
his
footman
,
so
that
with
the
suffering
he
endure
at
the
Bannerworths
'
,
and
the
want
of
sympathy
he
be
likely
to
find
at
home
,
that
individual
have
certainly
nothing
to
congratulate
himself
upon
but
the
melancholy
reminiscence
of
his
own
cleverness
.
 
<EOS>
but
be
the
mob
satisfied
with
what
have
occur
in
the
churchyard
?
<EOS>
They
be
not
,
and
that
night
be
to
witness
the
perpetration
of
a
melancholy
outrage
,
such
as
the
history
of
the
time
present
no
parallel
to
.
 
<EOS>
the
finding
of
a
brick
in
the
coffin
of
the
butcher
,
instead
of
the
body
of
that
individual
,
soon
spread
as
a
piece
of
startle
intelligence
all
over
the
place
;
and
the
obvious
deduction
that
be
draw
from
the
circumstance
,
seem
to
be
that
the
deceased
butcher
be
unquestionably
a
vampyre
,
and
out
upon
some
expedition
at
the
time
when
his
coffin
be
search
.
 
<EOS>
how
he
have
originally
get
out
of
that
receptacle
for
the
dead
be
certainly
a
mystery
;
but
the
story
be
none
the
bad
for
that
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
an
ingenious
individual
find
a
solution
for
that
part
of
the
business
,
for
,
as
he
say
,
nothing
be
more
natural
,
when
anybody
die
who
be
capable
of
become
a
vampyre
,
than
for
other
vampyre
who
know
it
to
dig
him
up
,
and
lie
him
out
in
the
cold
beam
of
the
moonlight
,
until
he
acquire
the
same
sort
of
vitality
they
themselves
possess
,
and
join
their
horrible
fraternity
.
 
<EOS>
in
lieu
of
a
well
explanation
--
and
,
after
all
,
it
be
no
bad
one
--
this
theory
be
generally
receive
,
and
,
with
a
shudder
horror
,
people
ask
themselves
,
if
the
whole
of
the
churchyard
be
excavate
,
how
many
coffin
would
be
find
tenantless
by
the
dead
which
have
be
suppose
,
by
simple
-
minded
people
,
to
inhabit
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
presence
,
however
,
of
a
body
of
dragoon
,
towards
evening
,
effectually
prevent
any
renew
attack
upon
the
sacred
precinct
of
the
churchyard
,
and
it
be
a
strange
and
startling
thing
to
see
that
country
town
under
military
surveillance
,
and
sentinel
post
at
its
principal
building
.
 
<EOS>
this
measure
smother
the
vengeance
of
the
crowd
,
and
insure
,
for
a
time
,
the
safety
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
;
for
no
considerable
body
of
person
could
assemble
for
the
purpose
of
attack
his
house
again
,
without
be
follow
;
so
such
a
step
be
not
attempt
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
so
happen
,
however
,
that
on
that
very
day
,
the
funeral
of
a
young
man
be
to
have
take
place
,
who
have
put
up
for
a
time
at
that
same
inn
where
Admiral
Bell
be
first
introduce
to
the
reader
.
<EOS>
He
have
become
seriously
ill
,
and
,
after
a
few
day
of
indisposition
,
which
have
puzzle
the
country
practitioner
,
breathe
his
last
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
to
have
be
bury
in
the
village
churchyard
on
the
very
day
of
the
riot
and
confusion
incidental
to
the
exhumation
of
the
coffin
of
the
butcher
,
and
probably
from
that
circumstance
we
may
deduce
the
presence
of
the
clergyman
in
canonical
at
the
period
of
the
riot
.
 
<EOS>
when
it
be
find
that
so
disorderly
a
mob
possess
the
churchyard
,
the
idea
of
bury
the
stranger
on
that
day
be
abandon
;
but
still
all
would
have
go
on
quietly
as
regard
him
,
have
it
not
be
for
the
folly
of
one
of
the
chamber
-
maid
at
the
tavern
.
 
<EOS>
this
woman
,
with
all
the
love
of
gossip
incidental
to
her
class
,
have
,
from
the
first
,
enter
so
fully
into
all
the
particular
concern
vampyre
,
that
she
fairly
may
be
consider
to
be
a
little
deranged
on
that
head
.
<EOS>
Her
imagination
have
be
so
work
upon
,
that
she
be
in
an
unfit
state
to
think
of
anything
else
,
and
if
ever
upon
anybody
<EOS>
a
stern
and
revolting
superstition
be
calculate
to
produce
direful
effect
,
it
be
upon
this
woman
.
 
<EOS>
the
town
be
tolerably
quiet
;
the
presence
of
the
soldiery
have
frighten
some
and
amuse
other
,
and
no
doubt
the
night
would
have
pass
off
serenely
,
have
she
not
suddenly
rush
into
the
street
,
and
,
with
bewilder
accent
and
frantic
gesture
<EOS>
shouted,--
 
<EOS>
"
a
vampyre
--
a
vampyre
--
a
vampyre
!
"
 
<EOS>
these
word
soon
collect
a
crowd
around
her
,
and
then
,
with
scream
accent
,
which
would
have
be
quite
enough
to
convince
any
reflect
person
that
she
have
actually
go
distract
upon
that
point
,
she
cried,--
 
<EOS>
"
come
into
the
house
--
come
into
the
house
!
<EOS>
look
upon
the
dead
body
,
that
should
have
be
in
its
grave
;
it
be
fresher
now
than
it
be
the
day
on
which
it
die
,
and
there
be
a
colour
in
its
cheek
!
<EOS>
a
vampyre
--
a
vampyre
--
a
vampyre
!
<EOS>
Heaven
save
us
from
a
vampyre
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
strange
,
infuriate
,
maniacal
manner
in
which
these
word
be
utter
,
produce
an
astonishingly
exciting
effect
among
the
mob
.
<EOS>
several
woman
scream
,
and
some
few
faint
.
<EOS>
the
torch
be
lay
again
to
the
altar
of
popular
feeling
,
and
the
fierce
flame
of
superstition
burn
brightly
and
fiercely
.
 
<EOS>
some
twenty
or
thirty
person
,
with
shout
and
exclamation
,
rush
into
the
inn
,
while
the
woman
who
have
create
the
disturbance
still
continue
to
rave
,
tear
her
hair
,
and
shriek
at
interval
,
until
she
fall
exhausted
upon
the
pavement
.
 
<EOS>
soon
,
from
a
hundred
throat
,
rise
the
dreadful
cry
of
"
a
vampyre
--
a
vampyre
!
"
<EOS>
the
alarm
be
give
throughout
the
whole
town
;
the
bugle
of
the
military
sound
;
there
be
a
clash
of
arm
--
the
shriek
of
woman
;
altogether
,
the
premonitory
symptom
of
such
a
riot
as
be
not
likely
to
be
quell
without
bloodshed
and
considerable
disaster
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
truly
astonishing
the
effect
which
one
weak
or
vicious
-
minded
person
can
produce
upon
a
multitude
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
a
woman
whose
opinion
would
have
be
account
valueless
upon
the
most
common
-
place
subject
,
and
whose
word
would
not
have
pass
for
twopence
,
set
a
whole
town
by
the
ear
by
force
of
nothing
but
her
sheer
brutal
ignorance
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
notorious
physiological
fact
,
that
after
four
or
five
day
,
or
even
a
week
,
the
body
of
many
person
assume
an
appearance
of
freshness
,
such
as
may
have
be
look
for
in
vain
immediately
after
death
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
the
most
insidious
process
of
that
decay
which
appear
to
regret
with
its
      
"
-----------
offensive
finger
,
to
mar
the
line
where
beauty
     
linger

"
 
<EOS>
but
what
do
the
chamber
-
maid
know
of
physiology
?
<EOS>
probably
,
she
would
have
ask
if
it
be
anything
good
to
eat
;
and
so
,
of
course
,
have
her
head
full
of
vampyre
,
she
must
needs
produce
so
lamentable
a
scene
of
confusion
,

result

which

[

<EOS>
the
mob
seem
from
the
first
to
have
an
impression
that
,
as
regard
the
military
force
,
no
very
serious
result
would
arise
from
that
quarter
,
for
it
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
,
on
an
occasion
which
could
not
possibly
arouse
any
ill
blood
on
the
part
of
the
soldiery
,
or
on
which
they
could
have
the
least
personal
feeling
,
they
would
like
to
get
a
bad
name
,
which
would
stick
to
them
for
year
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
political
riot
,
on
which
man
may
be
suppose
,
in
consequence
of
differ
in
opinion
,
to
have
their
passion
inflame
;
so
that
,
although
the
call
of
the
civil
authority
for
military
aid
have
be
accede
to
,
yet
it
be
hope
,
and
,
indeed
,
almost
understand
by
the
officer
,
that
their
operation
would
lie
confine
more
to
a
demonstration
of
power
,
than
anything
else
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
some
of
the
man
have
get
talk
to
the
townspeople
,
and
have
hear
all
about
the
vampyre
story
,
and
not
be
of
the
most
refined
or
educated
class
themselves
,
they
feel
rather
interested
than
otherwise
in
the
affair
.
 
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
,
then
,
we
be
inclined
to
think
,
that
the
disorderly
mob
of
that
inn
have
not
so
wholesome
a
fear
as
it
be
most
certainly
intend
they
should
have
of
the
redcoat
.
<EOS>
then
,
again
,
they
be
not
attack
the
churchyard
,
which
,
in
the
first
case
,
be
the
main
point
in
dispute
,
and
about
which
the
authority
have
feel
so
very
sore
,
inasmuch
as
they
feel
that
,
if
once
the
common
people
find
out
that
the
sanctity
of
such
place
could
be
outrage
with
impunity
,
they
would
lose
their
reverence
for
the
church
;
that
be
to
say
,
for
the
host
of
person
who
live
well
and
get
fat
in
this
country
by
the
trade
of
religion
.
 
<EOS>
[

<EOS>
consequently
,
this
churchyard
be
the
main
point
of
defence
,
and
it
be
zealously
look
to
when
it
nee
not
have
be
do
so
,
while
the
public
-
house
where
there
really
reign
mischief
be
half
unguarded
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
always
in
all
community
,
whether
large
or
small
,
a
number
of
person
who
really
have
,
or
fancy
they
have
,
something
to
gain
by
disturbance
.
<EOS>
these
people
,
of
course
,
care
not
for
what
pretext
the
public
peace
be
violate
;
so
long
as
there
be
a
row
,
and
something
like
an
excuse
for
run
into
other
people
's
house
,
they
be
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
to
get
into
a
public
-
house
under
such
circumstance
be
an
unexpected
treat
;
and
thus
,
when
the
mob
rush
into
the
inn
with
such
symptom
of
fury
and
excitement
,
there
go
with
the
leader
of
the
disturbance
a
number
of
person
who
never
think
of
get
further
than
the
bar
,
where
they
attack
the
spirit
-
tap
with
an
alacrity
which
show
how
great
be
their
love
for
ardent
compound
.
 
<EOS>
leave
these
person
behind
,
however
,
we
will
follow
those
who
,
with
a
real
superstition
,
and
a
furious
interest
in
the
affair
of
the
vampyre
,
make
their
way
towards
the
upper
chamber
,
determine
to
satisfy
themselves
if
there
be
truth
in
the
statement
so
alarmingly
make
by
the
woman
who
have
create
such
an
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
astonish
what
people
will
do
in
crowd
,
in
comparison
with
the
act
that
they
would
be
able
to
commit
individually
.
<EOS>
there
be
usually
a
calmness
,
a
sanctity
,
a
sublimity
about
death
,
which
irresistibly
induce
a
respect
for
its
presence
,
alike
from
the
educate
or
from
the
illiterate
;
and
let
the
object
of
the
fell
-
destroyer
's
presence
be
whom
it
may
,
the
very
consciousness
that
death
have
claim
it
for
its
own
,
invest
it
with
a
halo
of
respect
,
that
,
in
life
,
the
individual
could
never
aspire
to
probably
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
precede
these
furious
rioter
for
a
few
moment
,
and
look
upon
the
chamber
of
the
dead
--
that
chamber
,
which
for
a
whole
week
,
have
be
look
upon
with
a
kind
of
shudder
terror
--
that
chamber
which
have
be
darken
by
have
its
source
of
light
close
,
as
if
it
be
a
kind
of
disrespect
to
the
dead
to
allow
the
pleasant
sunshine
to
fall
upon
the
fade
form
.
 
<EOS>
and
every
inhabitant
of
that
house
,
upon
ascend
and
descend
its
intricate
and
ancient
staircase
,
have
walk
with
a
quiet
and
subdued
step
past
that
one
particular
door
.
 
<EOS>
even
the
tone
of
voice
in
which
they
speak
to
each
other
,
while
they
know
that
that
sad
remnant
of
mortality
be
in
the
house
,
be
quiet
and
subdue
,
as
if
the
repose
of
death
be
but
a
mortal
sleep
,
and
could
be
break
by
rude
sound
.
 
<EOS>
ay
,
even
some
of
these
very
person
,
who
now
with
loud
and
boisterous
clamour
,
have
rush
into
the
place
,
have
visit
the
house
and
talk
in
whisper
;
but
then
they
be
alone
,
and
man
will
do
in
<EOS>
throng
act
which
,
individually
,
they
would
shrink
from
with
compunction
or
cowardice
,
call
it
which
we
will
.
 
<EOS>
the
chamber
of
death
be
upon
the
second
story
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
back
room
,
the
window
of
which
command
a
view
of
that
half
garden
,
half
farm
-
yard
,
which
we
find
generally
belong
to
country
inn
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
the
shutter
be
close
,
with
the
exception
of
one
small
opening
<EOS>
,
that
,
in
daylight
,
would
have
admit
a
straggle
ray
of
light
to
fall
upon
the
corpse
.
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
that
the
sombre
shade
of
evening
have
wrap
everything
in
gloom
,
the
room
appear
in
total
darkness
,
so
that
the
most
of
those
adventurer
who
have
venture
into
the
place
shrink
back
until
light
be
procure
from
the
low
part
of
the
house
,
with
which
to
enter
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
a
dim
oil
lamp
in
a
niche
sufficiently
light
the
staircase
,
and
,
by
the
friendly
aid
of
its
glimmering
beam
,
they
have
find
their
way
up
to
the
landing
tolerably
well
,
and
have
not
think
of
the
necessity
of
have
light
with
which
to
enter
the
apartment
,
until
they
find
them
in
utter
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
these
requisite
,
however
,
be
speedily
procure
from
the
kitchen
of
the
inn
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
anything
that
be
want
be
lay
hold
of
without
the
least
word
of
remark
to
the
people
of
the
place
,
as
if
may
,
from
that
evening
forthwith
,
be
understand
to
constitute
right
,
in
that
town
.
 
<EOS>
up
to
this
point
no
one
have
take
a
very
prominent
part
in
the
attack
upon
the
inn
if
attack
it
could
be
call
;
but
now
the
man
whom
chance
,
or
his
own
nimbleness
,
make
the
first
of
the
throng
,
assume
to
himself
a
sort
of
control
over
his
companion
and
,
turn
to
them
<EOS>
,
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
Hark
ye
,
my
friend
;
we
will
do
everything
quietly
and
properly
;
so
I
think
we
would
better
three
or
four
of
us
go
in
at
once
,
arm
-
in

arm
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Psha

"
cry
one
who
have
just
arrive
with
a
light
;
"
it
be
your
cowardice
that
speak
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
in
first
;
let
those
follow
me
who
like
,
and
those
who
be
afraid
may
remain
where
they
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
at
once
dash
into
the
room
,
and
this
immediately
break
the
spell
of
fear
which
be
begin
to
creep
over
the
other
in
consequence
of
the
timid
suggestion
of
the
man
who
,
up
to
that
moment
,
have
be
first
and
foremost
in
the
enterprise
.
 
<EOS>
in
an
instant
the
chamber
be
half
fill
with
person
,
four
or
five
of
whom
carry
light
;
so
that
,
as
it
be
not
of
very
large
dimension
,
it
be
sufficiently
illuminate
for
every
object
in
it
to
be
clearly
visible
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
bed
,
smooth
and
unruffled
,
as
if
wait
for
some
expect
guest
;
while
close
by
its
side
a
coffin

over
which
a

contain
the
sad
remain
of
him
who
little
expect
in
life
that
,
after
death
,
he
should
be
stigmatise
as
an
example
of
one
of
the
ghastliest
superstition
that
ever
find
a
home
in
the
human
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
evident
that
some
one
have
be
in
the
room
;
and
that
this
be
the
woman
whose
excite
fancy
have
lead
her
to
look
upon
the
face
of
the
corpse
there
could
be
no
doubt
,
for
the
sheet
be
draw
aside
just
sufficiently
to
discover
the
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
the
fact
be
that
the
stranger
be
unknown
at
the
inn
,
or
probably
ere
this
<EOS>
the
coffin
lid
would
have
be
screw
on
;
but
it
be
hope
,
up
to
the
last
moment
,
as
advertisement
have
be
put
into
the
county
paper
,
that
some
one
would
come
forward
to
identify
and
claim
him
.
 
<EOS>
such
,
however
,
have
not
be
the
case
,
and
so
his
funeral
have
be
determine
upon
.
 
<EOS>
the
presence
of
so
many
person
at
once
effectually
prevent
any
individual
from
exhibit
,
even
if
he
feel
any
superstitious
fear
about
approach
the
coffin
;
and
so
,
with
one
accord
,
they
surround
it
,
and
look
upon
the
face
of
the
dead
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
repulsive
in
that
countenance
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
that
decomposition
have
sufficiently
advanced
to
induce
a
relaxation
of
the
muscle
,
and
a
softening
of
the
fibre
,
so
that
an
appearance
of
calmness
and
repose
have
creep
over
the
face
which
it
do
not
wear
immediately
after
death
.
 
<EOS>
It
happen
,
too
,
that
the
face
be
full
of
flesh
--
for
the
death
have
be
sudden
,
and
there
have
not
be
that
waste
away
of
the
muscle
and
integument
which
make
the
skin
cling
,
as
it
be
,
to
the
bone
,
when
the
ravage
of
long
disease
have
exhaust
the
physical
frame
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
,
unquestionably
,
a
plumpness
,
a
freshness
,
and
a
sort
of
vitality
about
the
countenance
that
be
remarkable
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
few
moment
there
be
a
death
-
like
stillness
in
the
apartment
,
and
then
one
voice
break
the
silence
by
exclaiming,--
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
vampyre
,
and
have
come
here
to
die
.
<EOS>
well
he
know
he
would
be
take
up
by
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
and
become
one
of
the
crew
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
"
cry
several
voice
at
once
;
"
a
vampyre
!
<EOS>
a
vampyre
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
hold
a
moment
,
"
cry
one
;
"
let
us
find
somebody
in
the
house
who
have
see
him
some
day
ago
,
and
then
we
can
ascertain
if
there
be
any
difference
in
his
look
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
suggestion
be
agree
to
,
and
a
couple
of
stout
man
run
down
stair
,
and
return
in
a
few
moment
with
a
tremble
waiter
,
whom
they
have
catch
in
the
passage
,
and
force
to
accompany
them
.
 
<EOS>
this
man
seem
to
think
that
he
be
to
be
make
a
dreadful
example
of
in
some
sort
of
way
;
and
,
as
he
be
drag
into
the
room
,
he
tremble
,
and
look
as
pale
as
death
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
have
I
do
,
gentleman
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
say
;
"
I
be
not
a
vampyre
.
<EOS>
do
not
be
drive
a
stake
through
me
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
gentleman
,
I
be
only
a
waiter
,
and
have
be
for
a
matter
of
five

and

twenty
year
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
do
no
harm
to
,
"
say
one
of
his
captor
;
"
you
have
only
get
to
answer
a
question
that
will
be
put
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
well
,
certainly
,
gentleman
;
anything
you
please
.
<EOS>
come
--
come
,
as
I
always
say
;
give
your
order
,
the
waiter
be
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
look
upon
the
fare
of
that
corpse
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
certainly
--
directly
.
"
 
"
have
you
ever
see
it
before
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
see
it
before
!
<EOS>
Lord
bless
you
!
<EOS>
yes
,
a
dozen
of
time
.
<EOS>
I
seed
him
afore
he
die
,
and
I
seed
him
arter
;
and
when
the
undertaker
's
man
come
,
I
come
up
with
them
<EOS>
and
I
seed
'em
put
him
in
his
coffin
.
<EOS>
You
see
I
keep
an
eye
on
'em
,
gentleman
,
because
know
well
enough
what
they
be
.
<EOS>
a
cousin
of
mine
be
in
the
trade
,
and
he
assure
me
as
one
of
'em
always
bring
a
tooth
-
draw
concern
in
his
pocket
,
and
look
in
the
mouth
of
the
blessed
corpse
to
see
if
there
be
a
blessed
tooth
worth
pull
out
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
hold
your
tongue
,
"
say
one
;
"
we
want
none
of
your

<EOS>
do
you

any
difference

in
the
face
of
the
corpse
to
what
it
be
some
day
since
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
do
not
know
;
somehow
,
it
do
not

so
rum
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
it
look
fresher
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
somehow
or
another
,
now
you
mention
it
,
it
be
very
odd
,
but
it
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
,
"
cry
the
man
who
have
question
him
,
with
considerable
excitement
of
manner
.
<EOS>
"
Neighbours
,
be
we
to
have
our
wife
and
our
child
scare
to
death
by
vampyre
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
--
no
!
"
cry
everybody
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
not
this
,
then
,
one
of
that
dreadful
order
of
being
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
--
yes
;
what
be
to

do
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
drive
a
stake
through
the
body
,
and
so
prevent
the
possibility
of
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
restoration
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
terrific
proposition
;
and
even
those
who
feel
most
strongly
upon
the
subject
,
and
have
their
fear
most
awakened
,
shrink
from
carry
it
into
effect
.
<EOS>
other
,
again
,
applaud
it
,
although
they
determine
,
in
their
own
mind
,
to
keep
far
enough
off
from
the
execution
of
the
job
,
which
they
hope
would
devolve
upon
other
,
so
that
they
may
have
all
the
security
of
feeling
that
such
a
process
have
be
go
through
with
the
suppose
vampyre
,
without
be
in
any
way
commit
by
the
dreadful
act
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
be
easy
than
to
procure
a
stake
from
the
garden
in
the
rear
of
the
premise
;
but
it
be
one
thing
to
have
the
mean
at
hand
of
carry
into
effect
<EOS>
so
dreadful
a
proposition
,
and
another
actually
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
credit
of
human
nature
,
we
regret
that
even
then
,
when
civilisation
and
popular
education
have
by
no
mean
make
such
rapid
stride
as
in
our
time
they
have
,
such
a
proposition
should
be
entertain
for
a
moment
:
<EOS>
but
so
it
be
;
and
just
as
an
alarm
be
give
that
a
party
of
the
soldier
have
reach
the
inn
and
have
take
possession
of
the
doorway
with
a
determination
to
arrest
the
rioter
,
a
strong
hedge
-
stake
have
be
procure
,
and
everything
be
in
readiness
for
the
perpetration
of
the
horrible
deed
.
 
<EOS>
even
then
those
in
the
room
,
for
they
be
tolerably
sober
,
would
have
revolt
,
probably
,
from
the
execution
of
so
fearful
an
act
;
but
the
entrance
of
a
party
of
the
military
into
the
low
portion
of
the
tavern
,
induce
those
who
have
be
make
free
with
the
strong
liquor
below
,
to
make
a
rush
up
-
stair
to
their
companion
with
the
hope
of
escape
detection
of
the
petty
larceny
,
if
they
get
into
trouble
on
account
of
the
riot
.
 
<EOS>
these
person
,
infuriate
by
drink
,
be
capable
of
anything
,
and
to
them
,
accordingly
,
the
more
sober
party
gladly
surrender
the
disagreeable
job
of
render
the
suppose
vampyre
perfectly
innoxious
,
by
drive
a
hedge
-
stake
through
his
body
--
a
proceeding
which
,
it
be
currently
believe
,
inflict
so
much
physical
injury
to
the
frame
,
as
to
render
his
resuscitation
out
of
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
the
cry
of
alarm
from
below
,
join
now
to
the
shout
of
those
mad
rioter
,
produce
a
scene
of
dreadful
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
We
can
not
,
for
we
revolt
at
the
office
,
describe
particularly
the
dreadful
outrage
which
be
commit
upon
the
corpse
;
suffice
it
that
two
or
three
,
madden
by
drink
,
and
incite
by
the
other
,
plunge
the
hedge
-
stake
through
the
body
,
and
there
leave
it
,
a
sickening
and
horrible
spectacle
to
any
one
who
may
cast
his
eye
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
with
such
violence
have
the
frightful
and
inhuman
deed
be
commit
,
that
the
bottom
of
the
coffin
be
perforate
by
the
stake
so
that
the
corpse
be
actually
nail
to
its
last
earthly
tenement
.
 
<EOS>
some
assert
,
that
at
that
moment
an
audible
groan
come
from
the
dead
man
,
and
that
this
arise
from
the
extinguishment
of
that
remnant
of
life
which
remain
in
him
,
on
account
of
his
be
a
vampyre
,
and
which
would
have
be
bring
into
full
existence
,
if
the
body
have
be
place
in
the
ray
of
the
moon
,
when
at
its
full
,
accord
to
the
popular
superstition
upon
that
subject
.
 
<EOS>
other
,
again
,
be
quite
ready
to
swear
that
at
the
moment
the
stake
be
use
there
be
a
visible
convulsion
of
all
the
limb
,
and
that
the
countenance
,
before
so
placid
and
so
calm
,
become
immediately
distorted
,
as
if
with
agony
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
have
do
with
these
horrible
surmise
;
the
dreadful
deed
have
be
commit
,
and
wild
,
ungovernable
superstition
have
have
,
for
a
time
,
its
sway
over
the
ignorant
and
debased
.

CHAPTER
XLIX
.
 
<EOS>
the
MOB
'S
ARRIVAL
<EOS>
at
SIR
franci
VARNEY'S.--THE
ATTEMPT
<EOS>
to
gain
ADMISSION
.
  
<EOS>
[
illustration
]
 
<EOS>
the
soldiery
have
be
send
for
from
their
principal
station
near
the
churchyard
,
and
have
advance
with
some
degree
of
reluctance
to
quell
what
they
consider
as
nothing
well
nor
bad
than
a
drunken
brawl
at
a
public
-
house
,
which
they
really
consider
they
ought
not
to
be
call
to
interfere
with
.
 
<EOS>
when
,
however
,
the
party
reach
the
spot
,
and
hear
what
a
confusion
there
be
,
and
see
in
what
number
the
rioter
be
assemble
,
it
become
evident
to
them
that
the
case
be
of
a
more
serious
complexion
than
they
have
at
first
imagine
,
and
consequently
they
feel
that
their
professional
dignity
be
not
so
much
compromised
with
their
interference
with
the
lawless
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
the
constabulary
of
the
town
be
there
,
and
to
them
the
soldier
promise
they
would
hand
what
prisoner
they
take
,
at
the
same
time
that
they
make
a
distinct
condition
that
they
be
not
to
be
trouble
with
their
custody
,
nor
in
any
way
further
annoy
in
the
business
beyond
take
care
that
they
do
not
absolutely
escape
,
after
be
once
secure
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
all
that
the
civil
authority
of
the
town
require
,
and
,
in
fact
,
they
hope
that
,
after
make
prisoner
of
a
few
of
the
ringleader
of
the
riotous
proceeding
,
the
rest
would
disperse
,
and
prevent
the
necessity
of
capture
them
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
know
,
however
,
that
both
military
and
civil
authority
be
completely
ignorant
of
the
dreadful
outrage
against
all
common
decency
,
which
have
be
commit
within
the
public
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
the
door
be
well
guard
,
and
the
question
now
be
how
the
rioter
be
to
be
make
to
come
down
stair
,
and
be
capture
;
and
this
be
likely
to
remain
a
question
,
so
long
as
no
mean
be
adopt
to
make
them
descend
.
<EOS>
so
that
,
after
a
time
,
it
be
agree
that
a
couple
of
trooper
should
march
up
stair
with
a
constable
,
to
enable
him
to
secure
any
one
who
seem
a
principal
in
the
riot
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
only
have
the
effect
of
drive
those
who
be
in
the
second
-
floor
,
and
see
the
approach
of
the
two
soldier
,
whom
they
think
be
back
by
the
whole
of
their
comrade
,
up
a
narrow
staircase
,
to
a
third
-
floor
,
rather
consist
of
loft
than
of
actual
room
;
but
still
,
for
the
time
,
it
be
a
refuge
;
and
owe
to
the
extreme
narrowness
of
the
approach
to
it
,
which
consist
of
nearly
a
perpendicular
staircase
,
with
any
degree
of
tact
or
method
,
it
may
have
be
admirably
defend
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
hurry
and
scramble
,
all
the
light
be
leave
behind
;
and
when
the
two
soldier
and
constable
enter
the
room
where
the
corpse
have
lain
,
they
become
,
for
the
first
time
,
aware
of
what
a
horrible
purpose
have
be
carry
out
by
the
infuriate
mob
.
 
<EOS>
the
sight
be
one
of
perfect
horror
,
and
harden
to
scene
which
may
strike
other
people
as
be
somewhat
of
the
terrific
as
these
soldier
may
be
suppose
to
be
by
their
very
profession
,
they
actually
sicken
at
the
sight
which
the
mutilate
corpse
present
,
and
turn
aside
with
horror
.
 
<EOS>
these
feeling
soon
give
way
to
anger
and
animosity
against
the
crowd
who
could
be
guilty
of
such
an
atrocious
outrage
;
and
,
for
the
first
time
,
a
strong
and
interested
vengeance
against
the
mob
pervade
the
breast
of
those
who
be
bring
to
act
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
the
soldier
run
down
stair
to
the
door
,
and
report
the
scene
which
be
to
be
see
above
.
<EOS>
a
determination
be
instantly
come
to
,
to
capture
as
many
as
possible
of
those
who
have
be
concern
in
so
diabolical
an
outrage
,
and
leave
a
guard
of
five
man
at
the
door
,
the
remainder
of
the
party
ascend
the
staircase
,
determine
upon
storm
the
last
refuge
of
the
rioter
,
and
drag
them
to
justice
.
 
<EOS>
the
report
,
however
,
of
these
proceeding
that
be
take
place
at
the
inn
,
spread
quickly
over
the
whole
town
;
and
soon
as
large
a
mob
of
the
disorderly
and
the
idle
as
the
place
could
at
all
afford
be
assemble
outside
the
inn
.
 
<EOS>
this
mob
appear
,
for
a
time
,
inertly
to
watch
the
proceeding
.
<EOS>
It
seem
rather
a
hazardous
thing
to
interfere
with
the
soldier
,
whose
carbine
look
formidable
and
troublesome
weapon
.
 
<EOS>
with
true
mob
courage
,
therefore
,
they
leave
the
minority
of
their
comrade
,
who
be
within
the
house
,
to
their
fate
;
and
after
a
whisper
conference
from
one
to
the
other
,
they
suddenly
turn
in
a
body
,
and
begin
to
make
for
the
outskirt
of
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
They
then
separate
,
as
if
by
common
consent
,
and
straggle
out
into
the
open
country
by
two
and
three
,
consolidate
again
into
a
mass
when
they
have
get
some
distance
off
,
and
clear
of
any
exertion
that
could
be
make
by
the
soldiery
to
stay
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
cry
then
rise
of
"
down
with
Sir
Francis
Varney
--
slay
him
--
burn
his
house
--
death
to
all
vampyre
!
"
<EOS>
and
,
at
a
rapid
pace
,
they
proceed
in
the
direction
of
his
mansion
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
leave
this
mob
,
however
,
for
the
present
,
and
turn
our
attention
to
those
who
be
at
the
inn
,
and
be
certainly
in
a
position
of
some
jeopardy
.
<EOS>
Their
number
be
not
great
,
and
they
be
unarmed
;
certainly
,
their
good
chance
would
have
be
to
have
surrender
at
discretion
;
but
that
be
a
measure
which
,
if
the
sober
one
have
feel
inclined
to
,
those
who
be
infuriate
and
half
madden
with
drink
would
not
have
accede
to
on
any
account
.
 
<EOS>
a
furious
resistance
be
,
therefore
,
fairly
to
be
expect
;
and
what
mean
the
soldiery
be
likely
to
use
for
the
purpose
of
storm
this
last
retreat
be
a
matter
of
rather
anxious
conjecture
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
case
of
a
regular
enemy
,
there
would
not
,
perhaps
,
have
be
much
difficulty
;
but
here
the
capture
of
certain
person
,
and
not
their
destruction
,
be
the
object
;
and
how
that
be
to
be
accomplish
by
fair
mean
,
certainly
be
a
question
which
nobody
feel
very
competent
to
solve
.
 
<EOS>
determination
,
however
,
will
do
wonder
;
and
although
the
rioter
number
over
forty
,
notwithstanding
all
their
desertion
,
and
not
above
seventeen
or
eighteen
soldier
march
into
the
inn
,
we
shall
perceive
that
they
succeed
in
accomplish
their
object
without
any
manoeuvring
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
the
space
in
which
the
rioter
be
confine
be
low
,
narrow
,
and
inconvenient
,
as
well
as
dark
,
for
the
light
on
the
staircase
cast
up
that
height
but
very
insufficient
ray
.
 
<EOS>
weapon
of
defence
they
find
but
very
few
,
<EOS>
and
yet
there
be
some
which
,
to
do
them
but
common
credit
<EOS>
,
they
use
as
effectually
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
these
attic
,
or
loft
,
be
use
as
lumber
-
room
,
and
have
be
so
for
year
,
so
that
there
be
a
collection
of
old
box
,
broken
piece
of
furniture
,
and
other
matter
,
which
will
,
in
defiance
of
everything
and
everybody
,
collect
in
a
house
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
formidable
mean
of
defence
,
if
not
of
offence
,
down
a
very
narrow
staircase
,
have
they
be
use
with
judgment
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
the
rioter
,
who
be
only
just
drunk
enough
to
be
fool
-
hardy
,
collect
a
few
of
these
article
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
,
and
swear
they
would
smash
anybody
who
should
attempt
to
come
up
to
them
,
a
threat
easier
utter
than
execute
.
 
<EOS>
and
besides
,
after
all
,
if
their
position
have
be
ever
so
impregnable
,
they
must
come
down
eventually
,
or
be
starve
out
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
soldier
be
not
at
liberty
to
adopt
so
slow
a
process
of
overcome
their
enemy
,
and
up
the
second
-
floor
staircase
they
go
,
with
a
determination
of
make
short
work
of
the
business
.
 
<EOS>
They
pause
a
moment
,
by
word
of
command
,
on
the
landing
,
and
then
,
after
this
slight
pause
,
the
word
be
give
to
advance
.
 
<EOS>
now
when
man
will
advance
,
in
spite
of
anything
and
everything
,
it
be
no
easy
matter
to
stop
them
,
and
he
who
be
foremost
among
the
military
would
as
soon
think
of
hesitating
to
ascend
the
narrow
staircase
before
him
,
when
order
so
to
do
,
as
pay
the
national
debt
.
<EOS>
on
he
go
,
and
down
come
a
great
chest
,
which
,
fall
against
his
foot
,
knock
him
down
as
he
attempt
to
scramble
over
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fire
,
"
say
the
officer
;
and
it
appear
that
he
have
make
some
arrangement
as
to
how
the
order
be
to
be
obey
,
for
the
second
man
fire
his
carbine
,
and
then
scramble
over
his
prostrate
comrade
;
after
which
he
stoop
,
and
the
third
fire
his
carbine
likewise
,
and
then
hurry
forward
in
the
same
manner
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
first
sound
of
the
fire
arm
the
rioter
be
take
completely
by
surprise
;
they
have
not
have
the
least
notion
of
affair
get
to
such
a
length
.
<EOS>
the
smell
of
the
powder
,
the
loud
report
,
and
the
sensation
of
positive
danger
that
accompany
these
phenomenon
,
alarm
them
most
terrifically
;
so
that
,
in
point
of
fact
,
with
the
exception
of
the
empty
chest
that
be
throw
down
in
the
way
of
the
first
soldier
,
no
further
idea
of
defence
seem
in
any
way
to
find
a
place
in
the
heart
of
the
besiege
.
 
<EOS>
They
scramble
one
over
the
other
in
their
eagerness
to
get
as
far
as
possible
from
immediate
danger
,
which
,
of
course
,
they
conceive
exist
in
the
most
imminent
degree
the
near
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
such
be
the
state
of
terror
into
which
they
be
throw
,
that
each
one
at
the
moment
believe
himself
shoot
,
and
the
soldier
have
overcome
all
the
real
difficulty
in
get
possession
of
what
may
thus
be
call
the
citadel
of
the
inn
,
before
those
man
who
have
be
so
valorous
a
short
time
since
recover
from
the
tremendous
fright
into
which
they
have
be
throw
.
 
<EOS>
We
need
hardly
say
that
the
carbine
be
load
,
but
with
blank
cartridge
,
for
there
be
neither
a
disposition
nor
a
necessity
for
take
the
life
of
these
misguided
people
.
 
<EOS>
if
be
the
suddenness
and
the
steadiness
of
the
attack
that
have
do
all
the
mischief
to
their
cause
;
and
now
,
ere
they
recover
from
the
surprise
of
have
their
position
so
completely
take
by
storm
,
they
be
hand
down
stair
,
one
by
one
,
from
soldier
to
soldier
,
and
into
the
custody
of
the
civil
authority
.
 
<EOS>
in
order
to
secure
the
safe
keeping
of
large
a
body
of
prisoner
,
the
constable
,
who
be
in
a
great
minority
,
place
handcuff
upon
some
of
the
most
capable
of
resistance
;
so
what
with
those
who
be
thus
secure
,
and
those
who
be
terrify
into
submission
,
there
be
not
a
man
of
all
the
lot
who
have
take
refuge
in
the
attic
of
the
public
-
house
but
be
a
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
sound
of
fire
-
arm
,
the
woman
who
be
outside
the
inn
have
,
of
course
,
raise
a
most
prodigious
clamour
.
 
<EOS>
They
believe
directly
that
every
bullet
must
have
do
some
most
serious
mischief
to
the
townspeople
,
and
it
be
only
upon
one
of
the
soldier
,
a
non
-
commissioned
officer
,
who
be
below
,
assure
them
of
the
innoxious
nature
of
the
proceeding
which
restore
anything
like
equanimity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Silence
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
:
"
what
be
you
howl
about
?
<EOS>
do
you
fancy
that
we
have
nothing
well
to
do
than
to
shoot
a
parcel
of
fellow
that
be
not
worth
the
bullet
that
would
be
lodge
in
their
confound
carcase
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
we
hear
the
gun
,
"
say
a
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
do
;
it
be
the
powder
that
make
the
noise
,
not
the
bullet
.
<EOS>
You
will
see
them
all
bring
out
safe
wind
and
limb
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
assurance
satisfy
the
woman
to
a
certain
extent
,
and
such
have
be
their
fear
that
they
should
have
have
to
look
upon
the
spectacle
of
death
,
or
of
grievous
wound
,
that
they
be
comparatively
quite
satisfied
when
they
see
husband
,
father
,
and
brother
,
only
in
the
custody
of
the
town
officer
.
 
<EOS>
and
very
sheepish
some
of
the
fellow
look
,
when
they
be
hand
down
and
handcuff
,
and
the
more
especially
when
they
have
be
route
only
by
a
few
blank
cartridge
--
that
sixpenny
worth
of
powder
have
defeat
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
march
off
to
the
town
gaol
,
guard
by
the
military
,
who
now
probably
fancy
that
their
night
's
work
be
over
,
and
that
the
most
turbulent
and
troublesome
spirit
in
the
town
have
be
secure
.
 
<EOS>
such
,
however
,
be
not
the
case
,
for
no
sooner
have
comparative
order
be
restore
,
than
common
observation
point
to
a
dull
red
glare
in
the
southern
sky
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
few
more
minute
there
come
in
straggler
from
the
open
country
,
shout
"

with

CHAPTER
L.
 
<EOS>
the
MOB
'S
ARRIVAL
<EOS>
at
SIR
franci
VARNEY'S.--THE
ATTEMPT
<EOS>
to
gain
ADMISSION
.
  
<EOS>
[
illustration
]
 
<EOS>
all
eye
be
direct
towards
that
southern
sky
which
each
moment
be
become
more
and
more
illuminate
by
the
lurid
appearance
bespeak
a
conflagration
,
which
if
it
be
not
extensive
,
at
all
event
be
rage
fiercely
.
 
<EOS>
there
come
,
too
upon
the
wind
,
which
set
from
that
direction
,
strange
sound
,
resemble
shout
of
triumph
,
combine
occasionally
with
sharp
cry
,
indicative
of
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
with
so
much
system
and
so
quietly
have
this
attack
be
make
upon
the
house
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
--
for
the
consequence
of
it
now
exhibit
themselves
most
unequivocally
--
that
no
one
who
have
not
actually
accompany
the
expedition
be
in
the
least
<EOS>
aware
that
it
have
be
at
all
undertake
,
or
that
anything
of
the
kind
be
on
the
tapi
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
it
could
be
no
longer
keep
a
secret
,
and
as
the
infuriate
mob
,
who
have
seek
this
flagrant
mean
of
give
vent
to
their
anger
,
see
the
flame
from
the
blaze
house
rise
high
in
the
heavens
<EOS>
,
they
feel
convinced
that
further
secrecy
be
out
of
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
in
such
cry
and
shout
as
--
but
for
caution
's
sake
--
they
would
have
indulge
in
from
the
very
first
,
they
now
give
utterance
to
their
feeling
as
regard
the
man
whose
destruction
be
aim
at
.
 
<EOS>
"
death
to
the
vampyre!--death
to
the
vampyre
!
"
be
the
principal
shout
,
and
it
be
utter
in
tone
which
sound
like
those
of
rage
and
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
necessary
,
now
that
we
have
dispose
of
the
small
number
of
rioter
who
commit
so
serious
an
outrage
at
the
inn
,
that
we
should
,
with
some
degree
of
method
,
follow
the
proceeding
of
the
large
number
,
who
go
from
the
town
towards
Sir
Francis
Varney
's
.
 
<EOS>
these
person
either
have
information
of
a
very
positive
nature
,
or
a
very
strong
suspicion
that
,
notwithstanding
the
mysterious
and
most
unaccountable
disappearance
of
the
vampyre
in
the
old
ruin
,
he
would
now
be
find
,
as
usual
,
at
his
own
residence
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
one
of
his
own
servant
may
have
thus
play
the
traitor
to
him
;
but
however
it
be
,
there
certainly
be
an
air
of
confidence
about
some
of
the
leader
of
the
tumultuous
assemblage
that
induce
a
general
belief
that
this
time
,
at
least
,
the
vampyre
would
not
escape
popular
vengeance
for
be
what
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
before
notice
that
these
people
go
out
of
the
town
at
different
point
,
and
do
not
assemble
into
one
mass
until
they
be
at
a
sufficient
distance
off
to
be
free
from
all
fear
of
observation
.
 
<EOS>
then
some
of
the
less
observant
and
cautious
of
them
begin
to
indulge
in
shout
of
rage
and
defiance
;
but
those
who
place
themselves
foremost
succeed
in
procure
a
halt
,
and
one
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
good
friend
all
,
if
we
make
any
noise
,
it
can
only
have
one
effect
,
and
that
is
,
to
warn
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
and
enable
him
to
escape
.
<EOS>
if
,
therefore
,
we
can
not
go
on
quietly
,
I
propose
that
we
return
to
our
home
,
for
we
shall
accomplish
nothing
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
advice
be
sufficiently
and
evidently
reasonable
to
meet
with
no
dissension
;
a
death
-
like
stillness
ensue
,
only
break
by
some
two
or
three
voice
say
,
in
subdue
tones,--
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
right
--
that
be
right
.
<EOS>
nobody
speak
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
come
on
,
then
,
"
say
he
who
have
give
such
judicious
counsel
;
and
the
dark
mass
of
man
move
towards
Sir
Francis
Varney
's
house
,
as
quietly
as
it
be
possible
for
such
an
assemblage
to
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
save
the
sound
of
the
footstep
,
nothing
could
be
hear
of
them
at
all
;
and
that
regular
tramp
,
tramp
,
would
have
puzzle
any
one
listen
to
it
from
any
distance
to
know
in
which
direction
it
be
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
way
they
go
on
until
Sir
Francis
Varney
's
house
be
reach
,
and
then
a
whispered
word
to
halt
be
give
,
and
all
eye
be
bent
upon
the
building
.
 
<EOS>
from
but
one
window
out
of
the
numerous
one
with
which
the
front
of
the
mansion
be
stud
do
there
shine
the
least
light
,
and
from
that
there
come
rather
an
uncommonly
bright
reflection
,
probably
arise
from
a
reading
lamp
place
close
to
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
a
general
impression
,
they
know
not
why
exactly
,
seem
to
pervade
everybody
,
that
in
the
room
from
whence
stream
that
bright
light
be
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
vampyre
's
room
!
<EOS>
"
say
several
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
vampyre
's
room
!
<EOS>
that
be
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
he
who
have
a
kind
of
moral
control
over
his
comrade
;
"
I
have
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
he
be
there
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
to
be
do
?
"
ask
several
.
 
<EOS>
"
make
no
noise
whatever
,
but
stand
aside
,
so
as
not
to
be
see
from
the
door
when
it
be
open
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
knock
for
admittance
,
and
,
<EOS>
the
moment
it
be
answer
,
I
will
place
this
stick
in
such
a
manner
within
,
that
the
door
can
not
be
close
again
.
<EOS>
upon
my
saying
'
Advance
,
'
you
will
make
a
rush
forward
,
and
we
shall
have
possession
immediately
of
the
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
all
this
be
agree
to
.
<EOS>
the
mob
slink
close
to
the
wall
of
the
house
,
and
out
of
immediate
observation
from
the
hall
door
,
or
from
any
of
the
window
,
and
then
the
leader
advance
,
and
knock
loudly
for
admission
.
 
<EOS>
the
silence
be
now
of
the
most
complete
character
that
could
be
imagine
.
<EOS>
those
who
come
there
so
bent
upon
vengeance
be
thoroughly
convince
of
the
necessity
of
extreme
caution
,
to
save
themselves
even
yet
from
be
completely
foil
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
abundant
faith
,
from
experience
,
of
the
resource
in
the
way
of
escape
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
and
not
one
among
them
be
there
who
consider
that
there
be
any
chance
of
capture
him
,
except
by
surprise
,
and
when
once
they
get
hold
of
him
,
they
determine
he
should
not
easily
slip
through
their
finger
.
 
<EOS>
the
knock
for
admission
produce
no
effect
;
and
,
after
wait
three
or
four
minute
,
it
be
very
provoking
to
find
such
a
wonderful
amount
of
caution
and
cunne
completely
throw
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
try
again
,
"
whisper
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
have
patience
;
I
be
go
to
try
again

"
 
<EOS>
the
man
have
the
ponderous
old
-
fashioned
knocker
in
his
hand
,
and
be
about
to
make
another
appeal
to
Sir
Francis
Varney
's
door
,
when
a
strange
voice
said,--
 
"
perhaps
you
may
as
well
say
at
once
what
you
want
,
instead
of
knock
there
to
no
purpose
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
give
a
start
,
for
the
voice
<EOS>
seem
to
come
from
the
very
door
itself
.
 
<EOS>
yet
it
sound
decidedly
human
;
and
,
upon
a
close
inspection
,
it
be
see
that
a
little
wicket
-
gate
,
not
large
than
a
man
's
face
,
have
be
open
from
within
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
terribly
provoking
.
<EOS>
here
be
an
extent
of
caution
on
the
part
of
the
garrison
quite
unexpected
.
<EOS>
what
be
to
be
do
?
 
<EOS>
"
well
?
"
say
the
man
who
appear
at
the
little
opening
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
"
say
he
who
have
knock
;
"
i--
"
 
<EOS>
"
well

I
--
that
be

well

you

you

"
no

"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
be
he
at

?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
decline

;
so
you
have
well
,
all
of
you
,
go
back
to
the
town
again
,
for
we
be
well
provide
with
all
material
to
resist
any
attack
you
may
be
fool
enough
to
make
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
as
he
speak
,
the
servant
shut
the
little
square
door
with
a
bang
that
make
his
questioner
jump
again

<EOS>
here
be
a

CHAPTER

<EOS>
the
ATTACK
upon
the
VAMPYRE
's
house.--the
STORY
of
the
attack.--the
forcing
of
the
doors
,
and
the
STRUGGLE
.
  
<EOS>
[

a
council
of
war
be
now
call
among
the
belligerent
,
who
be
somewhat
take
aback
by
the
steady
refusal
of
the
servant
to
admit
them
,
and
their
apparent
determination
to
resist
all
endeavour
on
the
part
of
the
mob
to
get
into
and
obtain
possession
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
argue
that
they
be
prepared
to
resist
all
attempt
,
and
it
would
cost
some
few
life
to
get
into
the
vampyre
's
house
.
<EOS>
this
pass
through
the
mind
of
many
as
they
retire
behind
the
angle
of
the
wall
where
the
council
be
to
be
hold
.
 
<EOS>
here
they
look
in
each
other
'
face
,
as
if
to
gather
from
that
the
general
tone
of
the
feeling
of
their
companion
;
but
here
they
see
nothing
that
intimate
the
least
idea
of
go
back
as
they
come
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
very
well
,
mate
,
to
take
care
of
ourselves
,
you
know
<EOS>
,
"
begin
one
tall
,
brawny
fellow
;
"
but
,
if
we
bean't
to
be
suck
to
death
by
a
vampyre
,
why
we
must
have
the
life
out
of
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
so
we
must
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
Hodge
be
right
;
we
must
kill
him
,
and
there
be
no
sin
in
it
,
for
he
have
no
right
to
it
;
he
be
rob
some
poor
fellow
of
his
life
to
prolong
his
own
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
,
that
be
the
way
he
do
;
bring
him
out
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
then
see
what
we
will
do
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
catch
him
first
,
"
say
one
,
"
<EOS>
and
then
we
can
dispose
of
him
afterwards
,
I
say
,
neighbour
<EOS>
,
do
not
you
think
it
would
be
as
well
to
catch
him
first
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
have
not
we
come
on
purpose
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
but
do
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
not
we
try
it

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
presently
,
when
we
come
to
get
into
the
house

"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
what
be
to
be
do
?
"
say
one
;
"
here
we
be
in
a
fix
,
I
think
,
and
I
can
not
see
our
way
out
very
clearly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
[

"
I
wish
we
could
get
in
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
how
be
a
question
I
do
not
very
well
see
,
"
say
a
large
speciman
of
humanity
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
good
thing
that
can
be
do
will
be
to
go
round
and
look
over
the
whole
house
,
and
then
we
may
come
upon
some
part
where
it
be
far
easy
to
get
in
at
than
by
the
front
door
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
it
will
not
do
for
us
all
to
go
round
that
way
,
"
say
one
;
"
a
small
party
only
should
go
,
else
they
will
have
all
their
people
station
at
one
point
,
and
if
we
can
divide
them
,
we
shall
beat
them
because
they
have
not
enough
to
defend
more
than
one
point
at
a
time
;
now
we
be
numerous
enough
to
make
several
attack

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
that
be
the
way
to
bother
them
all
round

in

"
no

no

"

the
big
countryman

"
I
like
to
make

we
will

that
be
my

we
will
do
it

<EOS>
come
on
,
and
let
's
have
another
look
at
the
street

door

"
 
<EOS>
the
big
countryman
leave
the
main
body
,
and
resolutely
walk
up
to
the
main
avenue
,
and
approach
the
door
,
accompany
by
about
a
dozen
or
less
of
the
mob
.
<EOS>
when
they
come
to
the
door
,
they
commence
knock
and
kick
most
violently
,
and
assail
it
with
all
kind
of
thing
they
could
lay
their
hand
upon
.
 
<EOS>
They
continue
at
this
violent
exercise
for
some
time
--
perhaps
for
five
minute
,
when
the
little
square
hole
in
the
door
be
again
open
,
and
a
voice
be
hear
to
say,--
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
well
cease
that
kind
of
annoyance

"
 
<EOS>
"
We
want
to
get
in

It

cost
you
more
life
to
do
so
than
you
can
afford
to
spare

We
be
well
armed
,

be
prepared
to
resist
any
effort
you
can
make
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
it
be
all
very
well
;
but
,
an
you
will
not
open
,
why
we
will
make
you
;
that
be
all
about
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
say
as
the
big
countryman
and
his
companion
be
leave
the
avenue
towards
the
rest
of
the
body
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
,
take
this
,
as
an
earnest
of
what
be
to
follow
,
"
say
the
man
,
and
he
discharge
the
content
of
a
blunderbuss
through
the
small
opening
,
and
its
report
sound
to
the
rest
of
the
mob
like
the
report
of
a
field
-
piece
.
 
<EOS>
fortunately
for
the
party
retire
the
man
could
not
take
any
aim
,
else
it
be
questionable
how
many
of
the
party
would
have
get
off
unwounded
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
several
of
them
find
stray
slug
be
lodge
in
various
part

accelerate
their
retreat
from
the
house
of
the
vampyre

"
what
luck
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
one
of

I

ay

ay

we
have
,

all
the
lead

upon

well

what
be

dange

up

no

no

out

They
be
in
earnest

so
be
we

<EOS>
do
not
let
us
be
frightened
because
they
have
a
gun
or
two
<EOS>
--
they
can
not
have
many
;

besides
,
if
they
have
,
we
be

many

suck
to
death

the
house
to

well

well

what
can

where
can

in

stop
a
minute

they
be
armed
at

we
must
make
an
attack
on
all
point

else
we
may
fail
.
<EOS>
a
party
must
go
round
to
the
front

door

attempt
to
beat
it
in

there

that
,

at

Hurrah

down

down

now

away
in

strong
enough
to
carry
the

upon

with

<EOS>
loudly
do
the

for
assistance
,
and
but
for
their
fellow
who
come

in
behind
,
they
would
have

but
a
sorry
time
of

shout
the

.
 
<EOS>
"
We
will
try
,
"
say
the
mob
;
and
they
rush
forward
to
drive
the
servant
back
,
but
they
meet
with
a
stout
resistance
,
and
as
some
of
them
have
chopper
and
sword
,
there
be
a
few
wound
give
,
and
presently
bang
go
the
blunderbuss
.
 
<EOS>
two
or
three
of
the
mob
reel
and
fall
.
 
<EOS>
this
produce
a
momentary
panic
,
and
the
servant
then
have
the
whole
of
the
victory
to
themselves
,
and
be
about
to
charge
,
and
clear
the
passage
of
their
enemy
,
when
a
shout
behind
attract
their
attention
.
 
<EOS>
that
shout
be
cause
by
an
entrance
be
gain
in
another
quarter
,
whence
the

be
fly
,
and
all
be

<EOS>
"
Hurrah

<EOS>
hurrah

the

<EOS>
the

retreat
to
the
stair
,
and
here
unite
,
they
make
a
stand
,
and
resolve
to
resist
the
whole
force
of
the
rioter

,
for
some
minute
.

give
and
take
of
a
desperate
character

<EOS>
somehow
,
there
be
no
deadly
blow
receive
by
the
servant
;
they
be
be
force
and
beat
,
but
they
lose
no
life
;
this
may
be
account
for
by
the
fact
that
the
mob
use
no
more
deadly
weapon
than
stick
.
 
<EOS>
the
servant
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
on
the
contrary
,
be
mostly
armed
with
deadly
weapon
,
which
,
however
,
they
do
not
use
unnecessarily
.
<EOS>
They
stand
upon
the
hall

the
grand
staircase
,
with
long
pole
or
stick
,
about
the
size
of
quarter

stave
,
and
with
these
they
belabour
those
below
most
unmercifully
.
 
<EOS>
certainly
,
the
mob
be
by
no
mean
coward
,
for
the
struggle
to
close
with
their
enemy
be
as
great
as
ever
,
and
as
firm
as
could
well
be
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
they
rush
on
with
a
desperation
truly
characteristic
of
John
Bull
,
and
defy
the
heavy
blow
;
for
as
fast
as
one
be
stricken
down
another
occupy
his
place
,
and
they
insensibly
press
their
close
and
compact
front
upon
the
servant
,
who
be
become
fatigue
and
harass
.
 
<EOS>
"

from
among

<EOS>
the
mob
make
no
retrogade
movement
,
but
still
continue
to
press
onwards
,
and
in
another
moment
a
loud
report
ring
through
the
house
,
and
a
smoke
hang
over
the
head
of
the

a
long
groan

some
of
the

and
a
still
loud
from

and

of,--

place
,
when
a
shout
above
attract
the
attention
of
both
party

in
this
fierce
struggle
.

They

by
mutual

<EOS>
these
be
cry

escape
every

and
yet
no

could
give
an
answer
to

<EOS>
there
Sir
Francis
Varney

not

<EOS>
They
be
completely
thunderstricken
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
find
out
where
he
have
go
to
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
possible
mean
of
escape
,
that
they
could
perceive
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
an
odd
corner
,
or
even
anything
that
could
,
by
any
possibility
,
give
even
a
suspicion
that
even
a
temporary
concealment
could
take
place
.
 
<EOS>
They
look
over
every
inch
of
flooring

of
wainscote

not

could
be
discover

<EOS>

"
I

<EOS>
"
My

<EOS>
"
You

"
I
never

much
as
that

<EOS>
They
be
not
the
sort
of
people

say
another

<EOS>
"
but
if
they
can
do
one
thing
,
they
can
do
another

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
very
true
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
what
be
more
,
I
never
hear
as
how
a
vampyre
could
make
himself
into
nothing
before

he
have
do
so

<EOS>
"
He
may

<EOS>
"
My

<EOS>
what
precious
long
tooth
he
have
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
and
have
he
fix
one
on
'em
in
to
your
arm

he
would
have
draw
every
drop
of
blood
out
of
your
body

you
may
depend
upon
that
,
"
say
an
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
very
tall
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
too
tall
to
be
any
good
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
like
him
to
have
lay
hold
of
me
,
though
,
tall
as
he
be
;
and
then
he
would
have
lift
me
up
high
enough
to
break
my
neck
,
when
he
let
me
fall
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
mob
route
about
the
room
,
tear
everything
out
of
its
place
,
and
as
the
object
of
their
search
seem
to
be
far
enough
beyond
their
reach
,
their
courage
rise
in
proportion
,
and
they
shout
and
scream
with
a
proportionate
increase
of
noise
and
bustle
;
and
at
length
they
run
about
mad
with
rage
and
vexation
,
do
all
the
mischief
that
be
in
their
power
to
inflict
.
 
<EOS>
then
they
become
mischievous
,
and
tear
the
furniture
from
its
place
,
and
break
it
in
piece
,
and
then
amuse
themselves
with
break
it
up
,
throw
piece

glass

in
which
they
make
dreadful
hole

<EOS>
every

oh
,
dange

<EOS>
I
be
so
sick
;
I
wish
I
have
not
take
the
stuff
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
as
you
say
,
neighbour
,
and
then
we
be
cannibal

"
or
vampyre

"
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
pretty
thing
to
think
of
.
"
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
some
be
drunk
,
some
be
partially
so
,
and
the
remainder
be
crowd
into
the
cellar
to
get
their
share
of
the
wine
.
 
<EOS>
the
servant
have
now
slink
away
;
they
be
no
longer
notice
by
the
rioter
,
who
,
have
nobody
to
oppose
them
,
no
longer
think
of
anything
,
save
the
searching
after
the
vampyre
,
and
the
destruction
of
the
property
.
<EOS>
several
hour
have
be
spend
in
this
manner
,
and
yet
they
could
not
find
the
object
of
their
search
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
room
,
or
cupboard
,
or
a
cellar
<EOS>
,
that
be
capable
of
contain
a
cat
,
that
they
do
not
search
,
besides
a
part
of
the
rioter
keep
a
very
strict
watch
on
the
outside
of
the
house
and
all
about
the
ground
,
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
the
escape
of
the
vampyre
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
general
cessation
of
active
hostility
at
that
moment
;
a
reaction
after
the
violent
excitement
and
exertion
they
have
make
to
get
in
.
<EOS>
then
the
escape
of
their
victim
,
and
the
mysterious
manner
in
which
he
get
away
,
be
also
a
cause
of
the
reaction
,
and
the
rioter
look
in
each
other
'
countenance
inquiringly
.
 
<EOS>
above
all
,
the
discovery
of
the
wine
-
cellar
tend
to
withdraw
them
from
violent
measure
;
but
this
could
not
last
long
,
there
must
be
an
end
to
such
a
scene
,
for
there
never
be
a
large
body
of
man

for
an
evil
purpose
,
who
ever
be
,
for
any
length
of
time

peaceable

<EOS>
to
prevent
the
more
alarming
effect
of
drunkenness
,
some
few
of
the
rioter
,
after
have
take
some
small
portion
of
the
wine

become
,
from
the
peculiar
flavour
it
possess
,
imbue
with
the
idea
that
it
be
really
blood
,
and
forthwith
commence
an
instant
attack
upon
the
wine

liquor

they

soon

cellar

<EOS>
this
destruction
be
loudly
declaim
against
by
a
large

before

<EOS>
when

they
become
impatient
and
angry
at

<EOS>
many
believe
that

be
of
opinion
that
he
have
fly
away
by
some
mysterious

far
from

They

the
heap
of
combustible
material
that

<EOS>
"
Hurra

<EOS>
and
they
dance
like
maniacs
round
the
fire

look

in

,
like
so
many
wild
Indians
,
dance
round
their

<EOS>
the
torch
have

and
the
flame
unite
into
one

and
suddenly
shoot
up
with
a
velocity
,
and
roar
with
a
sound
that
cause
many
who
be
present
to
make
a
precipitate
retreat
from
the
hall
.
 
<EOS>
this
soon
become
a
necessary
measure
of
self
-
preservation
,
and
it
require
no
urging
to
induce
them
to
quit
a
place
that
be
burn
rapidly
and
even
furiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
get

shout
some
of
the
mob
,
and
,
lo
,
it
be
do
almost
by
magic
.
<EOS>
They
bring
the
faggot
and
wood
pile
up
for
winter
use
,
and
lay
them
near
all
the
door
,
and
especially
the
main
entrance

<EOS>
nay

every
gate
or
door

to
the
outhouse
be
bring
forward
and
place
upon
the
fire

the
upper
story

<EOS>
"
Hurra

<EOS>
and
a
loud
shout
of
triumph
come
from
the
mob

they
view
the
progress
of
the
flame
,
as
they
come
roar
and
tear
through
the

<EOS>
each
new
victory
of
the
element

Bob

would
not

very
much
grieve

"
if
I

I
hope

I
will
warrant

he
would
not

upon
look
in

quarter
whence
<EOS>
it
come

they
descry
a
large
body

people
come

from

issue
from

you

up
in
a
double
line
before
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
then
some
word
of
command
issue
,
and
some
more
give
to
some
of
the
subaltern
,
and
a
party
of
man
,
under
the
command
of
a
sergeant
,
be
send
off
from
the
main
body
,
to
make
a
circuit
of
the
house
and
ground
.
 
<EOS>
the
officer
gaze
for
some
moment
upon
the
burn
pile
without
speak
;
and
then
,
turn
to
the
next
in
command
,
he
say
in
low
tone
,
as
he
look
upon
the
mob,--
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
come
too
late
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
much
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
house
be
now
nearly
gutte
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
those
who
come
crowd
along
with
us
be
inextricably
mingle
with
the
other
who
have
be
the
cause
of
all
this
mischief
:
there
be
no
distinguish
them
one
from
another
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
if
you
do
,
you
could
not
say
who
have
do
it
,
and
who
have
not
;
you
could
prove
nothing
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
exactly
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
attempt
to
take
prisoner

unless
any
act
be
perpetrate
beyond
what
have
be
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
singular
affair

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
this
Sir
Francis
Varney
be
represent
to
be
a
courteous
,
gentlemanly
man
,
"
say
the
officer
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
doubt
about
it
,
but
he
be
beset
by
a
parcel
of
people
who
do
not
mind
cut
a
throat
if
they
can
get
an
opportunity
of
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
I
expect
they
will
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
when
there
be
a
popular
excitement
against
any
man
,
he
have
better
leave
this
part
at
once
and
altogether
.
<EOS>
It
be
dangerous
to
tamper
with
popular
prejudice
;
no
man
who
have
any
value
for
his
life
ought
to
do
so

<EOS>
It
be
a
sheer
act
of
suicide

<EOS>
the
officer
cease
to
speak
,
and
then
the
party
whom
he
have
send
round
the
house
and
ground
return
,
and
gain
the
main
body
orderly
enough
,
and
the
sergeant
go
forward
to
make
his
report
to
his
superior
officer
.
 
<EOS>
after
the
usual
salutation
,
he
wait
for
the
inquiry
to
be
put
to
him
as
to
what
he
have
see
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
Scott
,
what
have
you
do
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
go
round
the
premise
,
sir
,
accord
to
your
instruction
,
but
see
no
one
either
in
the
vicinity
of
the
house
,
or
in
the
ground
around
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
stranger
,
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
,
none
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
nothing
at
all
likely
to
lead
to
any
knowledge
as
to
who
it
be
that
have
cause
this
catastrophe
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
have
you
learn
anything
among
the
people
who
be
the
perpetrator
of
this
fire
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
that
will
do
,
unless
there
be
anything
else
that
you
can
think
of
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
nothing
further
,
sir
,
unless
it
be
that
I
hear
some
of
them
say
that
Sir
Francis
Varney
have
perish
in
the
flame
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
good
heaven
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
I
hear
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
must
be
impossible
,
and
yet
why
should
it
be
so
?
<EOS>
go
back
,
Scott
,
and
bring
me
some
person
who
can
give
me
some
information
upon
this
point
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
sergeant
depart
toward
the
people
,
who
look
at
him
without
any
distrust
,
for
he
come
single
-
handed
,
though
they
think
he
come
with
the
intention
of
learn
what
they
know
of
each
other
,
and
so
stroll
about
with
the
intention
of
get
up
accusation
against
them
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
the
case
,
the
officer
do
not
like
the
work
well
enough
;
he
would
rather
have
be
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
[

at
length
the
sergeant
come
to
one
man
,
whom
he
accost
,
and
say
to
him,--
 
"
do
you
know
anything
of
yonder
fire
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
:
I
do
know
it
be
a
fire
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
and
so
do
I.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
friend
,
"
say
the
sergeant
,
"
when
a
soldier
ask
a
question
he
do
not
expect
an
uncivil
answer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
a
soldier
may
ask
a
question
that
may
have
an
uncivil
end
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
may
;
but
it
be
easy
to
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
say
so
,
then
,
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
not
trouble
you
any
more
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
sergeant
move
on
a
pace
or
two
more
,
and
then
,
turn
to
the
mob
,
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
be
there
any
one
among
you
who
can
tell
me
anything
concern
the
fate
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
burn
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
see
him
burn
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
;
<EOS>
but
I
see
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
in
the
flame
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
;
before
the
house
be
on
fire
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
in
the
house
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
and
he
have
not
be
see
to
leave
it
since
,
and
we
conclude
he
must
have
be
burn
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
come
and
say
as
much
to
my
commanding
officer
?
<EOS>
It
be
all
I
want
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
be
detain
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
go
,
"
say
the
man
,
and
he
hobble
out
of
the
crowd
towards
the
sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
and
see
the
officer
,
and
tell
him
what
I
know
,
and
that
be
very
little
,
and
can
prejudice
no
one
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hurrah
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
crowd
,
when
they
hear
this
latter
assertion
;
for
,
at
first
,
they
begin
to
be
in
some
alarm
l
there
should
be
something
wrong
about
this
,
and
some
of
them
get
identify
as
be
active
in
the
fray
.
 
<EOS>
the
sergeant
lead
the
man
back
to
the
spot
,
where
the
officer
stand
a
little
way
in
advance
of
his
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
Scott
,
"
he
say
,
"
what
have
we
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
man
who
have
volunteer
a
statement
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
well
,
my
man
,
can
you
say
anything
concern
all
this
disturbance
that
we
have
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
what
do
you
come
here
for
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
understand
the
sergeant
to
want
some
one
who
could
speak
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
where
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
in
the
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
exactly
;
but
have
you
not
see
him
out
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
since
;
nor
any
one
else
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
where
be
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Upstairs
,
where
he
suddenly
disappear
,
and
nobody
can
tell
where
he
may
have
go
to
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
not
be
see
out
of
the
house
since
,
and
they
say
he
could
not
have
go
bodily
out
if
they
have
not
see
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
must
have
be
burn
,
"
say
the
officer
,
musingly
;
"
he
could
not
escape
,
one
would
imagine
,
without
be
see
by
some
one
out
of
such
a
mob
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
dear
no
,
for
I
be
tell
they
place
a
watch
at
every
hole
,
window
,
or
door
however
high
,
and
they
see
nothing
of
him
--
not
even
fly
out
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
fly
out
!
<EOS>
I
be
speak
of
a
man
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
of
a
vampire
!
"
say
the
man
carelessly
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
vampyre
!
<EOS>
pooh
,
pooh
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
no
!
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
be
a
vampyre
!
<EOS>
there
can
be
no
sort
of
doubt
about
it
.
<EOS>
You
have
only
to
look
at
him
,
and
you
will
soon
be
satisfied
of
that
.
<EOS>
see
his
great
sharp
tooth
in
front
,
and
ask
yourself
what
they
be
for
,
and
you
will
soon
find
the
answer
.
<EOS>
They
be
to
make
hole
with
in
the
body
of
his
victim
,
through
which
he
can
suck
their
blood
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
officer
look
at
the
man
in
astonishment
for
a
few
moment
,
as
if
he
doubt
his
own
ear
,
and
then
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
be
you
serious
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
ready
to
swear
to
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
have
hear
a
great
deal
about
popular
superstition
,
and
think
I
have
see
something
of
it
;
but
this
be
decidedly
the
bad
case
that
ever
I
see
or
hear
of
.
<EOS>
You
have
better
go
home
,
my
man
,
than
,
by
your
presence
,
countenance
such
a
gross
absurdity
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
for
all
that
,
"
say
the
man
,
"
Sir
Francis
Varney
be
a
vampyre
--
a
blood
-
sucker
--
a
human
blood
-
sucker
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
get
away
with
you
,
"
say
the
officer
,
"
and
do
not
repeat
such
folly
before
any
one
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
man
almost
jump
when
he
hear
the
tone
in
which
this
be
speak
,
for
the
officer
be
both
angry
and
contemptuous
,
when
he
hear
the
word
of
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
these
people
,
"
he
add
,
turn
to
the
sergeant
,
"
be
ignorant
in
the
extreme
.
<EOS>
one
would
think
we
have
get
into
the
country
of
vampire
,
instead
of
a
civilised
community
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
day
be
go
down
now
;
the
last
ray
of
the
set
sun
glimmer
upwards
,
and
still
shine
upon
the
tree
-
top
.
<EOS>
the
darkness
of
night
be
still
fast
close
around
them
.
<EOS>
the
mob
stand
a
motley
mass
of
human
being
,
wedge
together
,
dark
and
sombre
,
gaze
upon
the
mischief
that
have
be
do
--
the
work
of
their
hand
.
<EOS>
the
military
stand
at
ease
before
the
burn
pile
,
and
by
their
order
and
regularity
,
present
a
contrast
to
the
mob
,
as
strongly
by
their
bright
gleam
arm
,
as
by
their
dress
and
order
.
 
<EOS>
the
flame
now
envelop
the
whole
mansion
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
window
or
a
door
from
which
the
fiery
element
do
not
burst
forth
in
cloud
,
and
fork
flame
come
rush
forth
with
a
velocity
truly
wonderful
.
 
<EOS>
the
red
glare
of
the
flame
fall
upon
all
object
around
for
some
distance
--
the
more
especially
so
,
as
the
sun
have
sink
,
and
a
bank
of
cloud
rise
from
beneath
the
horizon
and
exclude
all
his
ray
;
there
be
no
twilight
,
and
there
be
,
as
yet
,
no
moon
.
 
<EOS>
the
country
side
be
envelop
in
darkness
,
and
the
burn
house
could
be
see
for
mile
around
,
and
form
a
rallying
-
point
to
all
man
's
eye
.
 
<EOS>
the
engine
that
be
within
reach
come
tear
across
the
country
,
and
come
to
the
fire
;
but
they
be
of
no
avail
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
supply
of
water
,
save
from
the
ornamental
pond
.
<EOS>
these
they
could
only
get
at
by
mean
that
be
tedious
and
unsatisfactory
,
consider
the
emergency
of
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
the
house
be
a
lone
one
,
and
it
be
be
entirely
consume
before
they
arrive
,
and
therefore
there
be
not
the
remote
chance
of
save
the
least
article
.
<EOS>
have
they
ever
such
a
supply
of
water
,
nothing
could
have
be
effect
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
thus
the
man
stand
idly
by
,
pass
their
remark
upon
the
fire
and
the
mob
.
 
<EOS>
those
who
stand
around
,
and
within
the
influence
of
the
red
glare
of
the
flame
,
look
like
so
many
demon
in
the
infernal
region
,
watch
the
progress
of
light
the
fire
,
which
we
be
tell
by
good
Christians
be
the
doom
of
the
unfortunate
in
spirit
,
and
the
woefully
unlucky
in
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
strange
sight
<EOS>
that
;
and
there
be
many
person
who
would
,
without
doubt
,
have
rather
be
snug
by
their
own
fire
-
side
than
they
would
have
remain
there
<EOS>
but
it
happen
that
no
one
feel
inclined
to
express
his
inclination
to
his
neighbour
,
and
,
consequently
,
no
one
say
anything
on
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
none
would
venture
to
go
alone
across
the
field
,
where
the
spirit
of
the
vampyre
may
,
for
all
they
know
to
the
contrary
,
be
wait
to
pounce
upon
them
,
and
worry
them
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
no
;
no
man
would
have
quit
that
mob
to
go
back
alone
to
the
village
;
they
would
sooner
have
stand
there
all
night
through
.
<EOS>
that
be
an
alternative
that
none
of
the
number
would
very
willingly
accept
.
 
<EOS>
the
hour
pass
away
,
and
the
house
that
have
be
that
morning
a
noble
and
well
-
furnish
mansion
,
be
now
a
smoulder
heap
of
ruin
.
<EOS>
the
flame
have
become
somewhat
subdued
,
and
there
be
now
more
smoke
than
flame
.
 
<EOS>
the
fire
have
exhaust
itself
.
<EOS>
there
be
now
no
more
material
that
could
serve
it
for
fuel
,
and
the
flame
begin
to
become
gradually
enough
subdue
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
there
be
a
rush
,
and
then
a
bright
flame
shoot
upward
for
an
instant
,
so
bright
and
so
strong
,
that
it
throw
a
flash
of
light
over
the
country
for
mile

on
the

of

which

be
truly
describe
as
a

good
servant
,
but
a
very
bad
master
;
and
of
the
truth
of
this
every
one
must
be
well
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
now
remain
little
more
than
the
livid
glare
of
the
hot

and
this

,
for
the
wall
be
too
strongly
build
to

from
their

they
be
strong

stout
,
and
intercept
the
little

the

<EOS>
the

now
begin
to
feel
fatigued
and
chilly
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
stand
and
walk
about
many
hour
,
and
the
approach
of
exhaustion
could
not
be
put
off
much
longer
,
especially
as
there
be
no
longer
any
great
excitement
to
carry
it
off
.
 
<EOS>
the

,
see
that
nothing
be

collect
his

together
,
and
they
be

<EOS>
He
have
be
order
to
stop
any
tumult
that
he
may
have
see
,
and
to
save
any

.
<EOS>
but
there
be
nothing
to
do
now
;
all
the
property
that
could
have
be
save
be
now
destroy
,
and
the

be
begin
to
disperse
,
and
creep
towards
their

<EOS>
the

be
then
give
for
the

,
and
keep

,
and
the
word
to
march
be
give
,
which
the
man
obey
with
alacrity
,
for
they
have
no
good
-
will
in
stop
there
the
whole
of
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
the
return
to
the
village
of
both
the
mob
and
the
military
be
not
without
its
vicissitude
;
accident
of
all
kind
be
rife
amongst
them
;
the
military
,
however
,
take
the
open
path
,
soon
diminish
the
distance
,
and
that
,
too
,
with
little
or
no
accident
,
save
such
as
may
have
be
expect
from
the
state
of
the
field
,
after
they
have
be
so
much
trodden
down
of
late
.
 
<EOS>
not
so
the
townspeople
or
the
peasantry
;
for
,
by
way
of
keep
up
their
spirit
,
and
amuse
themselves
on
their
way
home
,
they
commence
lark
,
as
they
call
it
,
which
often
mean
the
execution
of
practical
joke
,
and
these
sometimes
be
of
a
serious
nature
.
 
<EOS>
the
night
be
dark
at
that
hour
,
especially
so
when
there
be
a
number
of
person
traverse
about

so
that
little
or
nothing
could
be
see
.
 
<EOS>
the
mistake
and
blunder
that
be
make
be
numerous
.
<EOS>
in
one
place
there
be
a
number
of
people
penetrate
a
path
that
lead
only
to
a
hedge
and
deep
ditch
;
indeed
it
be
a
brook
very
deep
and
muddy
.
 
<EOS>
here
they
come
to
a
stop
and
endeavour
to
ascertain
its
width
,
but
the
little
reflected
light
they
have
be
deceptive
,
and
it
do
not
appear
so
broad
as
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh

I
can
jump
it
,
"
exclaim
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
can
I

"
say
another
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
do
so
before
,
and
why
should
I
not
do
so
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
unanswerable
,
and
as
there
be
many
present
,
at

a
dozen
be
eager
to
jump
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
thee
can
do
it
,
I
know
I
can

"
say
a
brawny
countryman
;
"
so
I
will
do
it
at

"
the

thus
urge
,
the
jumper
at
once
make
a
rush
to
the
edge
of
the
ditch
,

many
jump
,
and
many
more
,
from
the
prevail
darkness
,
do
not
see
exactly
where
the
ditch
be
,

take
one

two
step
too
many

find
themselves
up
above
the
waist
in
muddy
water

<EOS>
nor
be
those
who
jump
much
well
off

in

with

Jim

the

weight
thrust
into

the

would
be
revenge
upon

who
have
now
lose

the
fat

after

fill
with
dire
thought

a
spirit

he
look
from
side

with
this

he
feel
over

find
that
he
could
scrape
off
a
little
only
,
but
not
with
his

indeed

it
only
plaster
them

he

therefore
,
march
about

off

I
have
a

He
immediately

have
scarcely
get
his

into

find
there
would
be
a

difficulty

either
push
it
in

withdraw

altogether

the
pitch
make
it
difficult

his

stick
to

out

he
see
something
shine

he

soft

"
God
bless

what
now
?

<EOS>
He
pull
his
hand
hastily
away
,
and
find
that
it
stick
slightly
,
and
then
he
see
what
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
"
ay

ay
,
the
very
thing
.
<EOS>
surely
it
must
have

place
here
on

the
fact
be
,
he
have
place
his
hand
into
a
pot
of
pitch
that
have

leave
by
the
people
who
have

have

at
Sir

to
see
which
they
have
leave
their
work

and
the
pitch
be
leave
on
a
smoulder
peat
fire
,
so
that
when
Mr.
Jones
,
the
grocer
,
accidentally
put
his
hand
into
it
he
find
it
just
warm
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
make
this
discovery
he
dab
his
hand
again
into
the
pitch
-
pot
,
exclaiming,--
 
"
in
for
a
penny
,
in
for
a
pound
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
he
endeavour
to
secure
as
large
a
handful
of
the
slippery
and
sticky
stuff
as
he
could
,
and
<EOS>
this
do
he
set
off
to
come
up
with
the
big
countryman
who
have
do
him
so
much
indignity
and
make
his
stomach
uncomfortable
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
come
up
with
him
,
for
the
man
have
stop
rather
behind
,
and
be
lark
,
as
it
be
call
,
with
some
man
,
to
whom
he
be
a
companion
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
slip
down
a
bank
,
and
be
partially
sit
down
on
the
soft
mud
.
<EOS>
in
his
bustle
,
the
little
grocer
come
down
with
a
slide
,
close
to
the
big
countryman
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
--
ah
!
<EOS>
my
little
grocer
,
"
say
the
countryman
,
hold
out
his
hand
to
catch
him
,
and
draw
him
towards
himself
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
come
and
sit
down
by
the
side
of
your
old
friend
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
he
speak
,
he
endeavour
to
pull
Mr.
Jones
down
,
too
;
but
that
individual
only
reply
by
fetch
the
countryman
a
swinging
smack
across
the
face
with
the
handful
of
pitch
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
,
take
that
;
and
now
we
be
quit
;
we
shall
be
old
friend
after
this
,
eh
?
<EOS>
be
you
satisfied
?
<EOS>
You
will
remember
me
,
I
will
warrant
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
the
grocer
speak
,
he
rub
his
hand
over
the
face
of
the
fall
man
,
and
then
rush
from
the
spot
with
all
the
haste
he
could
make
.
 
<EOS>
the
countryman
sit
a
moment
or
two
confounded
,
cursing
,
and
swear
,
and
splutter
,
vow
vengeance
,
believe
that
it
be
mud
only
that
have
be
plaster
over
his
face
;
but
when
he
put
his
hand
up
,
and
find
out
what
it
be
,
he
roar
and
bellow
like
a
town
-
bull
.
 
<EOS>
He
cry
out
to
his
companion
that
his
eye
be
pitch
:
but
they
only
laugh
at
him
,
think
he
be
have
some
foolish
lark
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
next
day
before
he
get
home
,
for
he
wander
about
all
night
:
and
it
take
him
a
week
to
wash
the
pitch
off
by
mean
of
grease
;
and
ever
afterwards
he
recollect
the
pitching
of
his
face
;
nor
do
he
ever
forget
the
grocer
.
 
<EOS>
thus
it
be
the
whole
party
return
a
long
while
after
dark
across
the
field
,
with
all
the
various
accident
that

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
craft
well
enough
,
and
I
know
the
road
,
too
;
there
will
be
no
end
of
founder
against
the
breaker
to
find
where
they
lie
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no

not

<EOS>
what
do
you
mean
by
that
<EOS>
,
you
dog
,
eh

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
nothing
;
only
I
can
see
without
help
to
read
,
or
glass
either
;
so
I
know
one
place
from
another
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
now
some
one
move
within
;
and
the
admiral
,
follow
by
Jack
Pringle
,
enter
the
Hall
.
<EOS>
Henry
Bannerworth

there
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
ready
to
go
when
the
coach
come
for
them
,
which
the
admiral
have
order
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"

I.
"
 
"
go
,
and
station
yourself
up
in
some
place
where
you
can
keep
a
good
look
-
out
for
the
coach
,
and
come
and
report
when
you
see
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
--
ay
,
sir
,
"
say
Jack
,
and
away
he
go
from
the
room
,
and
station
himself
up
in
one
of
the
tree
,
that
command
a
good
view
of
the
main
road
for
some
distance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Admiral
Bell
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
here
we
be
,
trust
implicitly
to
you
;
and
in
do
so
,
I
be
sure
I
be
do
right
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
see
that
,
"
say
the
admiral
.
<EOS>
"
all
be
fair
and
honest
as
yet
;
and
what
be
to
come
,
will
speak
for
itself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
will
not
suffer
from
any
of
these
nocturnal
visit
,
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
much
care
about
them
;
but
old
Admiral
Bell
do
not
strike
his
colour
to
an
enemy
,
however
ugly
he
may
look
.
<EOS>
no
,
no
;
it
must
be
a
well
craft
than
his
own
that
will
take
him
;
and
one
who
will
not
run
away
,
but
that
will
grapple
yard
-
arm
and
yard
-
arm
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
admiral
,
you
must
have
see
many
danger
in
your
time
,
and
be
use
to
all
kind
of
disturbance
and
conflict
.
<EOS>
You
have
have
a
life
of
experience
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
and
experience
have
come
pretty
thick
sometimes
<EOS>
,
I
can
tell
you
,
when
it
come
in
the
shape
of
Frenchmen
's
broadside
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
,
then
,
it
must
be
rather
awkward
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
death
by
the
law
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
"
to
stop
one
of
them
with
your
head
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
make
the
attempt
myself
,
though
I
have
often
see
it
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare

;

here
be
Flora

<EOS>
as
he
speak
,
Flora
and
her
mother
enter
the
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
admiral
,
we
be
all
ready
;
and
,
though
I
may
feel
somewhat
sorry
at
leave
the
old
Hall
,
yet
it
arise
from
attachment
to
the
place
,
and
not
any
disinclination
to
be
beyond
the
reach
of
these
dreadful
alarm
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
I
,
too
,
shall
be
by
no
mean
sorry
,
"
say
Flora
;
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
it
be
some
gratification
to
know
we
leave
a
friend
here
,
rather
than
some
other
,
who
would
have
have
the
place
,
if
they
could
have
get
it
,
by
any
mean
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
that
be
true
enough
,
Miss
Flora
,
"
say
the
admiral
;
"
but
we
will
run
the
enemy
down
yet
,
depend
upon
it
.
<EOS>
but
once
away
,
you
will
be
free
from
these
terror
;
and
now
,
as
you
have
promise
,
do
not
let
yourself
be
see
any
where
at
all

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
our

they
shall
be
religiously
keep

I
can
assure

shout
Jack

"
say
the
admiral
,
surprised
;
and
then
he
mutter
,

confound
you
for
a
lubber

You

Squint
over
the

head
,
as
they
call
wall
,
and
then
atween
the
two
tree
on
the
starboard
side
of
the
course
,
then
straight
ahead
for
a
few
hundred
fathom
,
when
you
come
to
a
funnel
as
be
smoke
like
the
crater
of
Mount
Vesuvius
,
and
then
in
a
line
with
that
on
the
top
of
the
hill
,
come
our
boat
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
"
that
will
do
.
<EOS>
now
go
open
the
gate
,
and
keep
a
bright
look
out
,
and
if
you
see
anybody
near
your
watch
,
why
douse
their
glim
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
--
ay
,
sir
,
"
say
Jack
,
and
he
disappear
.
 
<EOS>
"
rather
a
lucid
description
,
"
say
Henry
,
as
he
think
of
Jack
's
report
to
the
admiral
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
it
be
a
seaman
's
report

<EOS>
I
know
what
he
mean
;
it
be
quick
and
plainer
than
the
land
lingo
,
to
my
ear
,
and
Jack
can
not
talk

other

you
see

"
 
<EOS>
by
this
time

into

descend
into

the
coach
in
which
the
family
of
the
Bannerworths
be
carry
away
continue
its
course
without
any
let
or
hindrance
,

they

no

the
fact

nearly
everybody

at
the
conflagration

Sir

house

Flora
know
not

,
after

time

all

<EOS>
darkness
set
in
,

they
all
sit
in
silence
in

at
length
,
after
some
time

be
spend
thus

turn
to
Jack

"
not

<EOS>
"
all
be
right

however
--
ship
in
the
direct
course

and
no
breaker
ahead

no
lookout
necessary

however
there
be
a
land

lubber
aloft
to
keep
a
look
out
.

<EOS>
as
this
be
not
very
intelligible
,
and
Jack
seem
to
have
his
own
reason
for
silence
,
they
ask
him
no
further
question
;
but
in
about
three
-
quarter
of
an
hour
,
during
which
time
the
coach
have
be
drive
through
the
tree
,
they
come
to
a
standstill
by
a
sudden
pull
of
the
check

string
from
Jack

who
said,--

"
Hilloa!--take
in
sails

begin
to
sing,--

"
the
trial

the
danger
of

past

door
open

they
all
get
out
and
look
about
them
where
they
be

"
up
the
garden
if
you

ma'am

as
quick
as
you

the
night
air

very
cold

<EOS>
Flora
and
her
mother
and
brother
take
the
hint
,
which
be
mean
by
Jack
to
mean
that
they
be
not
to
be
see
outside
.
<EOS>
They
at
once
enter
a
pretty
garden
,
and
then
they
come
to
a
very
neat
and
picturesque
cottage
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
time
to
look
up
at
it
,
as
the
door
be
immediately
open
by
an
elderly
female
,
who
be
intend
to
wait
upon

soon
after
,
Jack

the
passage
with
the
small
amount
of
luggage
which
they
have
bring
with
them
.
<EOS>
this
be
deposit
in
the
passage
,
and
then
Jack
go
out
again
,
and
,
after
a
few
minute
,
there
be
the
sound
of
wheel
,
which
intimate
that
the
coach
have
drive
off
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
,
however
,
return
in
a
few
minute
afterwards
,
have
secure
the
wicket
-
gate
at
the
end
of
the
garden
,
and
then
enter
the
house
,
shut
the
door
carefully
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
and
her
mother
look
over
the
apartment
in
which
they
be
show
with
some
surprise
.
<EOS>
It
be

CHAPTER

<EOS>
the
LONELY
WATCH
,
and
the
ADVENTURE
in
the
DESERTED
HOUSE
.
  
<EOS>
[

<EOS>
It
be
now
quite
night
,
and
so
peculiar
and
solemn
a
stillness
reign
in
and
about
Bannerworth
Hall
and
its
surround
ground
,
that
one
may
have
suppose
it
a
place
of
the
dead
,
desert
completely
after
sunset
by
all
who
would
still
hold
kindre
with
the
living
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
breath
of
air
stirring
,
and
this
circumstance
add
greatly
to
the
impression
of
profound
repose
which
the
whole
scene
exhibit
.
 
<EOS>
the
wind
during
the
day
have
be
rather
of
a
squally
character
,
but
towards
nightfall
,
as
be
often
usual
after
a
day
of
such
a
character
,
it
have
completely
lull
,
and
the
serenity
of
the
scene
be
unbroken
even
by
the
faint
sigh
from
a
wander
zephyr
.
 
<EOS>
the
moon
rise
late
at
that
period
,
and
as
be
always
the
case
at
that
interval
between
sunset
and
the
rise
of
that
luminary
which
make
the
night
so
beautiful
,
the
darkness
be
of
the
most
profound
character
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
those
night
to
produce
melancholy
reflection
--
a
night
on
which
a
man
would
be
apt
to
review
his
past
life
,
and
to
look
into
the
hidden
recess
of
his
soul
to
see
if
conscience
could
make
a
coward
of
him
in
the
loneliness
and
stillness
that
breathe
around
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
those
night
in
which
wanderer
in
the
solitude
of
nature
feel
that
the
eye
of
Heaven
be
upon
them
,
and
on
which
there
seem
to
be
a
more
visible
connection
between
the
world
and
its
great
Creator
than
upon
ordinary
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
the
solemn
and
melancholy
appear
place
once
instinct
with
life
,
when
desert
by
those
familiar
form
and
face
that
have
long
inhabit
them
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
desert
,
no
uninhabited
isle
in
the
far
ocean
,
no
wild
,
barren
,
pathless
tract
of
unmitigated
sterility
,
which
could
for
one
moment
compare
in
point
of
loneliness
and
desolation
to
a
deserted
city
.
 
<EOS>
Strip
London
,
mighty
and
majestic
as
it
be
,
of
the
busy
swarm
of
humanity
that
throng
its
street
,
its
suburb
,
its
temple
,
its
public
edifice
,
and
its
private
dwelling
,
and
how
awful
would
be
the
walk
of
one
solitary
man
throughout
its
noiseless
thoroughfare
.
 
<EOS>
[

<EOS>
if
madness
seize
not
upon
him
ere
he
have
be
long
the
sole
survivor
of
a
race
,
it
would
need
be
cast
in
no
common
mould
.
 
<EOS>
and
to
descend
from
great
thing
to
small
--
from
the
huge
leviathan
city
to
one
mansion
far
remove
from
the
noise
and
bustle
of
conventional
life
,
we
may
imagine
the
sort
of
desolation
that
reign
through
Bannerworth
Hall
,
when
,
for
the
first
time
,
after
nearly
a
hundred
and
fifty
year
of
occupation
,
it
be
desert
by
the
representative
of
that
family
,
so
many
member
of
which
have
live
and
die
beneath
its
roof
.
<EOS>
the
house
,
and
everything
within
,
without
,
and
around
it
,
seem
actually
to
sympathize
with
its
own
desolation
and
desertion
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
twenty
year
of
continued
occupation
could
not
have
produce
such
an
effect
upon
the
ancient
edifice
as
have
those
few
hour
of
neglect
and
desertion
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
it
be
not
as
if
it
have
be
strip
of
those
time
-
wear
and
ancient
relic
of
ornament
and
furnish
that
so
long
have
appertain
to
it
.
<EOS>
no
,
nothing
but
the
absence
of
those
form
which
have
be
accustom
quietly
to
move
from
room
to
room
,
and
to
be
meet
here
upon
a
staircase
,
there
upon
a
corridor
,
and
even
in
some
of
the
ancient
panel
apartment
,
which
give
it
an
air
of
dreary
repose
and
listlessness
.
 
<EOS>
the
shutter
,
too
,
be
all
closed
,
and
that
circumstance
contribute
largely
to
the
production
of
that
gloomy
effect
which
otherwise
could
not
have
ensue
.
 
<EOS>
in
fact
,
what
could
be
do
without
attract
very
special
observation
be
do
to
prove
to
any
casual
observer
that
the
house
be
untenanted
.
 
<EOS>
but
such
be
not
really
the
case
.
<EOS>
in
that
very
room
where
the
much
dread
Varney
the
vampyre
have
make
one
of
his
dread
appearance
to
Flora
Bannerworth
and
her
mother
,
sit
two
man
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
from
that
apartment
that
Flora
have
discharge
the
pistol
,
which
have
be
leave
to
her
by
her
brother
,
and
the
shot
from
which
it
be
believe
by
the
whole
family
have
most
certainly
take
effect
upon
the
person
of
the
vampyre
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
room
peculiarly
accessible
from
the
gardens
,
for
it
have
long
french
window
open
to
the
very
ground
,
and
but
a
stone
step
intervene
between
the
flooring
of
the
apartment
and
a
broad
gravel
walk
which
wound
round
that
entire
portion
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
this
room
,
then
,
that
two
man
sit
in
silence
,
and
nearly
in
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
before
them
,
and
on
a
table
,
be
several
article
of
refreshment
,
as
well
of
defence
and
offence
,
accord
as
their
intention
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
bottle
and
three
glass
,
and
lie
near
the
elbow
of
one
of
the
man
be
a
large
pair
of
pistol
,
such
as
may
have
adorn
the
belt
of
some
desperate
character
,
who
wish
to
instil
an
opinion
of
his
prowess
into
his
foe
by
the
magnitude
of
his
weapon
.
 
<EOS>
close
at
hand
,
by
the
same
party
,
lie
some
more
modern
fire
arm
,
as
well
as
a
long
dirk
,
with
a
silver
mount
handle
.
 
<EOS>
the
light
they
have
consist
of
a
large
lantern
,
so
construct
with
a
slide
,
that
it
could
be
completely
obscure
at
a
moment
's
notice
;
but
now
as
it
be
place
,
the
ray
that
be
allow
to
come
from
it
be
direct
as
much
from
the
window
of
the
apartment
,
as
possible
,
and
fall
upon
the
face
of
the
two
man
,
reveal
them
to
be
Admiral
Bell
and
Dr.
Chillingworth
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
the
effect
of
the
particular
light
in
which
he
sit
,
but
the
doctor
look
extremely
pale
,
and
do
not
appear
at
all
at
his
ease
.
 
<EOS>
the
admiral
,
on
the
contrary
,
appear
in
as
placable
a
state
of
mind
as
possible
and
have
his
arm
fold
across
his
breast
,
and
his
head
shrink
down
between
his
shoulder
as
if
he
have
make
up
his
mind
to
something
that
be
to
last
a
long
time
,
and
,
therefore
he
be
make
the
good
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
hope
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
after
a
long
pause
,
"
that
our
effort
will
be
crown
with
success
--
you
know
,
my
dear
sir
,
that
I
have
always
be
of
your
opinion
,
that
there
be
a
great
deal
more
in
this
matter
than
meet
the
eye
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
"
and
as
to
our
effort
be
crown
with
success
,
why
,
I
will
give
you
a
toast
,
doctor
,
'
may
the
morning
's
reflection
provide
for
the
evening
's
amusement
.
'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ha
!
ha
!
"
say
Chillingworth
,
faintly
;
"
I
would
rather
not
drink
any
more
,
and
you
seem
,
admiral
,
to
have
transpose
the
toast
in
some
way
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
run
,
'
may
the
evening
's
amusement
bear
the
morning
's
reflection

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
transpose
the
devil
!
"
say
the
admiral
;
"
what
do
I
care
how
it
run
?
<EOS>
I
give
you
my
toast
,
and
as
to
that
you
mention
,
it
be
another
one
altogether
,
and
a
sneak
,
shore
-
go
one
too
:
<EOS>
but
why
do
not
you
drink
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
my
dear
sir
,
medically
speak
,
I
be
strongly
of
opinion
that
,
when
the
human
stomach
be
make
to
contain
a
large
quantity
of
alcohol
,
it
produce
bad
effect
upon
the
system
.
<EOS>
now
,
I
have
certainly
take
one
glass
of
this
infernally
strong
holland
,
and
it
be
now
lie
in
my
stomach
like
the
red
-
hot
heater
of
a
tea
-
urn
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
it
?
<EOS>
put
it
out
with
another
,
then
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
I
be
afraid
that
would
not
answer
,
but
do
you
really
think
,
admiral
,
that
we
shall
effect
anything
by
wait
here
,
and
keep
watch
and
ward
,
not
under
the
most
comfortable
circumstance
,
this
first
night
of
the
Hall
be
empty
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
do
not
know
that
we
shall
,
"
say
the
admiral
;
"
<EOS>
but
when
you
really
want
to
steal
a
march
upon
the
enemy
,
there
be
nothing
like
begin
betime
.
<EOS>
We
be
both
of
opinion
that
Varney
's
great
object
throughout
have
be
,
by
some
mean
or
another
,
to
get
possession
of
the
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
true
,
true
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
know
that
he
have
be
uncease
in
his
endeavour
to
get
the
Bannerworth
family
out
of
it
;
that
he
have
offer
them
their
own
price
to
become
its
tenant
,
and
that
the
whole
gist
of
his
quiet
and
placid
interview
with
Flora
in
the
garden
,
be
to
supply
her
with
a
new
set
of
reason
for
urge
her
mother
and
brother
to
leave
Bannerworth
Hall
,
because
the
old
one
be
certainly
not
find
sufficient
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
true
,
true
,
most
true
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
emphatically
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
sir
,
that
from
the
first
time
you
broach
that
view

subject

me

how
entirely
I
coincide
with
you

<EOS>
"
of
course
you
do

for
you
be
a
honest

a
right

though
you
be
a
doctor
,
and
I
do
not
know
that
I
like
doctor
much
well

I

lawyer

they're
<EOS>
only
humbug
in

you

of
course
I
be
much
oblige

for
your

I
only
wish
it
have
strike
me
to
bring
something
of
a
solid
nature
in
the
shape
of
food

to
sustain
the
waste

shall
have

here

"
do
not
trouble
yourself
about
that
,

say
the
admiral
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
do
you
think
I
be
a
donkey
,

would
set
out
on
a
cruise
without
victual
my
ship

<EOS>
I
should
think
not

<EOS>
Jack
Pringle
will
be
here
soon

the
watch

what
do
you
mean

why

I

with
the
window
fasten
so
as
to
prevent
our

from

see
,
and
the
door
close
,
how

by
any

house
be
attack

not

"
 
<EOS>
"
Hark'ee
,
my
friend
,
"
say
the
admiral
;
"
I
have
leave
a
weak
point
for
the
enemy
.

"
 
<EOS>
"
a
what

"
 
<EOS>
"
a
weak
point

<EOS>
I
have
take
good
care
to
secure
everything

one
of
the
window
on
the
ground
floor
,
and
that
I
have
leave
open
,
or
so
nearly
open
,
that
it
will
look
like
the
most
natural
place
in
the
world
to
get
in
at
.
<EOS>
now
,
just
inside
that
window
,
I
have
place
a
lot
of
the
family
crockery
.
<EOS>
I
will
warrant
,
if
anybody
so
much
as
put
his
foot
in
,
you
will
hear
the
smash;--and
,
d----e

there
it
be

"
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
loud
crash
at
this
moment
,
follow
by
a
succession
of
similar
sound
,
but
of
a
less
degree
;
and
both
the
admiral
and
Mr.
Chillingworth
spring
to
their
foot
.

"
come
on

cry
the
former
;

here'll
be
a
precious
row
--
take
the
lantern

<EOS>
Mr.
Chillingworth
do
so
,
but
he
do
not
seem
possess
of
a
great
deal
of
presence
of
mind
;
for
,
before
they
get
out
of
the
room
,
he
twice
accidentally
put
on
the
dark
slide
,
and
produce
a
total
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
"
D

"
say
the
admiral
;
"
do
not
make
it
wink
and
wink
in
that
way

hold
it
up

It
be
one
of
the
window
of
a
long
room
,
contain
five
,
front
the
garden
,
which
the
admiral
have
leave
purposely
unguarded
;
and
it
be
not
far
from
the
apartment
in
which
they
have
be
sit
,
so
that
,
probably
,
not
half
a
minute
's
time
elapse
between
the
moment
of
the
first
alarm
,
and
their
reach
the
spot
from
whence

from
the
room
towards
the
front
door
of
the
Hall

He

Jack

instinctively
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
this
way

<EOS>
Jack
stagger
after
him
,
and
they
all
reach
the
room
where
the
admiral
and
Mr.
Chillingworth
have
be
sit
before
the
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
!
"
say
the
admiral
,
put
the
light
upon
the
table
,
and
point
to
the
bottle
;
"
what
do
you
think
of
that
?
<EOS>

<EOS>

I
never

under

here

the
wooden
wall

old
England

<EOS>
He
seize
the
bottle
,
and
,
put
its
neck
into
his
mouth
,
for
a
few
moment
nothing
be
hear
but
a
gurgle
sound
of
the
liquor
pass
down
his
throat
;
his
head
go
further
and
further
back
,
until
,
at
last
,
over
he
go
,
chair
and
bottle
and
all
,
and
lie
in
a
helpless
state
of
intoxication
on
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
"
so
far
,
so
good
,

the
admiral

"
<EOS>
He
be
out
of
the
way
,
at
all
event
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
just
loosen
his
neckcloth
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
"
and
then
we
will
go
and
sit
somewhere
else
;
and
I
should
recommend
that
,
if
anywhere
,
we
take
up
our
station
in
that
chamber
,
once
Flora
's
,
where
the
mysterious
panelled
portrait
hang
,
that
bear
so
strong
a
resemblance

Varney

vampyre

<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
say
the
admiral
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
They
listen
for
a
moment
intently
;
and
then
,
distinctly
,
upon
the
gravel
path
outside
the
window
,
they
hear
a
footstep
,
as
if
some
person
be
walk
along
,
not
altogether
heedlessly
,
but
yet
without
any
very
great
amount
of
caution
or
attention
to
the
noise
he
may
make
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hist
!
"

the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
not
a
word

They
come
.

"
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
say
they
for
?
"
say
the
admiral
.
 
<EOS>
"
because
something
seem
to
whisper
me
that
Mr.
Marchdale
know
more
of
Varney
,
the
vampyre

than
ever
he
have
choose
to
reveal
.

put
out
the
light
.

yes

that'll
do

rise

through

chink

shutter

no

no

it

not
in

direction

light
would
have
betray
us

<EOS>
do
you
not
see
the
beam
come
from
that
half
glass
-
door
lead
to
the
greenhouse
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
and
there
be
the
footstep
again
,
or
another
.
"
 
<EOS>
Tramp
,
tramp
come
a
footfall
again
upon
the
gravel
path
,
and
,
as
before
,
die
away
upon
their
listening
ear
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
say
now
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth--"are
there
not
two
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
they
be
a
dozen
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
"
although
we
have
lose
one
of
our
force
,
I
would
tackle
them
.
<EOS>
let
's
creep
on
through
the
room
in
the
direction
the
footstep
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
life
on
it
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
as
they
leave
the
apartment
,
"
if
this
be
Varney
,
he
make
for
that
apartment
where
Flora
sleep
,
and
which
he
know
how
to
get
admission
to
.
<EOS>
I
have
study
the
house
<EOS>
well
,
admiral
,
and
to
get
to
that
window
any
one
from
here
outside
must
take
a
considerable
round
.
<EOS>
come
on
--
we
shall
be
beforehand
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
good
idea
--
a
good
idea
.
<EOS>
be
it
so
.
"
 
<EOS>
just
allow
themselves
sufficient
light
to
guide
them
on
the
way
from
the
lantern
,
they
hurry
on
with
as
much
precipitation
as
the
intricacy
of
the
passage
would
allow
,
nor
halt
till
they
have
reach
the
chamber
be
hang
the
portrait
which
bear
so
striking
and
remarkable
a
likeness
to
Varney
,
the
vampyre
.
 
<EOS>
They
leave
the
lamp
outside
the
door
,
so
that
not
even
a
straggle
beam
from
it
could
betray
that
there
be
person
on
the
watch
;
and
then
,
as
quietly
as
foot
could
fall
,
they
take
up
their
station
among
the
hanging
of
the
antique
bedstead
,
which
have
be
before
allude
to
in
this
work
as
a
remarkable
piece
of
furniture
appertain
to
that
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
"
we
have
distance
them
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
we
have
.
<EOS>
It
be
unlucky
that
the
blind
of
the
window
be
down
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
it
?
<EOS>
by
Heaven
,
there
be
a
d----d
strange
-
look
shadow
creep
over
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Chillingworth
look
almost
with
suspend
breath
.
<EOS>
even
he
could
not
altogether
get
rid
of
a
tremulous
feeling
,
as
he
see
that
the
shadow
of
a
human
form
,
apparently
of
very
large
dimension
,
be
on
the
outside
,
with
the
arm
spread
out
,
as
if
feel
for
some
mean
of
open
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
easy
now
to
have
fire
one
of
the
pistol
direct
upon
the
figure
;
but
,
somehow
or
another
,
both
the
admiral
and
Mr.
Chillingworth
shrink
from
that
course
,
and
they
feel
much
rather
inclined
to
capture
whoever
may
make
his
appearance
,
only
use
their
pistol
as
a
last
resource
,
than
gratuitously
and
at
once
to
resort
to
violence
.
 
<EOS>
"
who
should
you
say
that
be
?
"
whisper
the
admiral
.
 
<EOS>
"
Varney
,
the
vampyre
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
D----e
,
he
be
ill
-
looking
and
big
enough
for
anything
--
there
be
a
noise
!
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
strange
cracking
sound
at
the
window
,
as
if
a
pane
of
glass
be
be
very
stealthily
and
quietly
broken
;
and
then
the
blind
be
agitate
slightly
,
confuse
much
the
shadow
that
be
cast
upon
it
,
as
if
the
hand
of
some
person
be
introduce
for
the
purpose
of
effect
a
complete
entrance
into
the
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
come
in
,
"
whisper
the
admiral

<EOS>
"
Hush
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
!
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
;
"
you
will
alarm
him
,

we
shall
lose
the
fruit

all
the
labour

matter

do
you
not

by

<EOS>
"
why

yes
;
I
do

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

go
and
do
it

then
;
for
,
as
sure
as
you

his

will
be
in
in
a
minute
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
here
go
,
"
say
the
admiral
;
"
I
never
suggest
anything
which
I
be
unwilling
to
do
myself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
whoever
it
be
that
now
be
make
such
strenuous
exertion
to
get
into
the
apartment
seem
to
find
some
difficulty
as
regard
the
fastening
of
the
window
,
and
as
this
difficulty
increase
,
the
patience
of
the
party
,
as
well
as
his
caution
desert
him
,
and
the
casement
be
rattle
with
violence
.
 
<EOS>
with
a
far
great
amount
of
caution
than
any
one
from
a
knowledge
of
his
character
would
have
give
him
credit
for
,
the
admiral
creep
forward
and
lay
himself
exactly
under
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
the
depth
of
wood
-
work
from
the
floor
to
the
low
part
of
the
window
-
frame
do
not
exceed
above
two
foot
;
so
that
any
one
could
conveniently
step
in
from
the
balcony
outride
on
to
the
floor
of
the
apartment
,
which
be
just
what
he
who
be
attempt
to
effect
an
entrance
be
desirous
of
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
quite
clear
that
,
be
he
who
he
may
,
mortal
or
vampyre
,
he
have
some
acquaintance
with
the
fastening
of
the
window
;
for
now
he
succeed
in
move
it
,
and
the
sash
be
throw
open
.
 
<EOS>
the
blind
be
still
an
obstacle
;
but
a
vigorous
pull
from
the
intruder
bring
that
down
on
the
prostrate
admiral
;
and
then
Mr.
Chillingworth
see
,
by
the
moonlight
,
a
tall
,
gaunt
figure
stand
in
the
balcony
,
as
if
just
hesitate
for
a
moment
whether
to
get
head
first
or
foot
first
into
the
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
have
he
choose
the
former
alternative
he
would
need
,
indeed
,
to
have
be
endow
with
more
than
mortal
power
of
defence
and
offence
to
escape
capture
,
but
his
lucky
star
be
in
the
ascendancy
,
and
he
put
his
foot
in
first
.
 
<EOS>
He
turn
his
side
to
the
apartment
and
,
as
he
do
so
,
the
blight
moonlight
fall
upon
his
face
,
enable
Mr.
Chillingworth
to
see
,
without
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
,
that
it
be
,
indeed
,
Varney
,
the
vampyre
,
who
be
thus
stealthily
make
his
entrance
into
Bannerworth
Hall
,
accord
to
the
calculation
which
have
be
make
by
the
admiral
upon
that
subject
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
scarcely
know
whether
to
be
pleased
or
not
at
this
discovery
;
it
be
almost
a
terrifying
one
,
sceptical
as
he
be
upon
the
subject
of
vampyre
,
and
he
wait
breathless
for
the
issue
of
the
singular
and
perilous
adventure
.
 
<EOS>
no
doubt
Admiral
Bell
deeply
congratulate
himself
upon
the
success
which
be
about
to
crown
his
stratagem
for
the
capture
of
the
intruder
,
be
he
who
he
may
,
and
he
writhe
with
impatience
for
the
foot
to
come
sufficiently
near
him
to
enable
him
to
grasp
it
.
 
<EOS>
His
patience
be
not

in

it
rest
upon

<EOS>
"

the

back

he
see
at
once
the
dilemma
into
which
his
friend
have
fall

<EOS>
there
he
lie
upon
his
back
,
grasping
,
with
the
vehemence
of
an
embrace
that
have
in
it
much
of
the
ludicrous
,
a
long
boot
,
from
which
the
intruder
have
cleverly
slip
his
leg
,
leave
it
as
a
poor
trophy
in
the
hand
of
his
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
you
have
only
pull
his
boot
off
,
"
say
the
doctor
;
"
and
now
he

for
good

slip
through
your
finger

"
 
<EOS>
Admiral
Bell
sit
up
and
look
at
the
boot
with
a
rueful
countenance

"
do
again
!

he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes

you
be

the
doctor
;

why
do
not
you
lay
hold
of
the

about
it

be
these
your

do
not

out

may
do
something

It

away

as

below
have
hear
him
give
the
word
,
two
loud
report
from
the
garden
immediately
ensue

a
crash
of
glass
testify
to
the
fact

some
deadly
missile

enter
the

<EOS>
the
warning.--the
new
plan
of
operation.--the
insulting
MESSAGE
from
VARNEY

<EOS>
[

<EOS>
so
much
of
the
night
have
be
consume
in
these
operation
,
that
by
the
time
they
be
over
,
and
the
three
personage
who
lie
upon
the
floor
of
what
may
be
call
the
haunt
chamber
of
Bannerworth
Hall
,
even
have
they
now
be
dispose
to
seek
repose
,
would
have
have
a
short
time
to
do
so
before
the
daylight
would
have
stream
in
upon
them
,
and
rouse
them
to
the
bustle
of
wake
existence
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
well
believe
what
a
vast
amount
of
surprise
come
over
the
three
person
in
that
chamber
at
the
last
little
circumstance
that
have
occur
in
connection
with
the
night
's
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
which
have
precede
that
,
that
do
not
resemble
a
genuine
attack
upon
the
premise
;
but
about
that
last
mysterious
appearance
,
with
its
curious
light
,
there
be
quite
enough
to
bother
the
admiral
and
Jack
Pringle
to
a
considerable
effect
,
whatever
may
be
the
effect
upon
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
whose
profession
better
enable
him
to
comprehend
,
chemically
,
what
would
produce
effect
that
,
no
doubt
,
astonish
them
amazingly
.
 
<EOS>
what
with
his
intoxication
and
the
violent
exercise
he
have
take
,
Jack
be
again
thoroughly
prostrate
;
while
the
admiral
could
not
have
look
more
astonished
<EOS>
have
the
evil
one
himself
appear
in
_
propria
persona
_
and
<EOS>
give
him
notice
to
quit
the
premise
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
,
however
,
the
first
to
speak
,
and
the
word
he
speak
be
address
to
Jack
,
to
whom
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
,
you
lubber
,
what
do
you
think
of
all
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
Jack
,
however
,
be
too
far
go
even
to
say
"
ay
,
ay
,
sir
;
"
and
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
slowly
get
himself
up
to
his
foot
,
approach
the
admiral
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
hard
to
say
so
much
,
Admiral
Bell
,
"
he
say
,
"
but
it
strike
me
that
whatever
object
this
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
or
Varney
,
the
vampyre
,
have
in
come
into
Bannerworth
Hall
,
it
be
,
at
all
event
,
of
sufficient
importance
to
induce
him
to
go
any
length
,
and
not
to
let
even
a
life
to
stand
in
the
way
of
its
accomplishment

it

so
,

I
will
be

if

in
defeat

"
 
<EOS>

we

We
have
get
into
the
adventure
,

I
do
not
see
why
we
should
not
carry
it
out

<EOS>
It
may
be
grow
a
little
serious
;
but
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
for
the
sake
of
that
young
girl
,
Flora
Bannerworth
,
as
well
as
for
the
sake
of
my
nephew
,
Charles
Holland
,
I
will
see
the
end
of
this
affair
,
let
it
be
what
it
may
;
but
mind
you
,
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
if
one
man
choose
to
go
upon
a
desperate
service
,
that
be
no
reason
why
he
should
ask
another
to
do
so

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
understand
you
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
;
"
but
,
have
commence
the
adventure
with
you
,
I
be
not
the
man
to
desert
you
in
it

<EOS>
We
have
commit
a
great
mistake
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
mistake
!
<EOS>
how
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
we
ought
to
have
watch
outside
the
house
,
instead
of
within
it
.
<EOS>
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
if
we
have
lain
in
wait
in
the
garden
,
we
should
have
be
in
a
well
position
to
have
accomplish
our
object
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
do
not
know
,
doctor
,
but
it
seem
to
me
that
if
Jack
Pringle
have
not
make
such
a
fool
of
himself
,
we
should
have
manage
very
well
:
and
I
do
not
know
now
how
he
come
to
behave
in
the
manner
he
do
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
nor
I
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
.
<EOS>
"
but
,
at
all
event
,
so
far
as
the
result
go
,
it
be
quite
clear
that
any
further
watch
,
in
this
house
,
for
the
appearance
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
will
now
be
in
vain
.
<EOS>
He
have
nothing
to
do
now
but
to
keep
quiet
until
we
be
tired
out
--
a
fact
,
concern
which
he
can
easily
obtain
information
--
and
then
he
immediately
,
without
trouble
,
walk
into
the
premise
,
to
his
own
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
what
the
deuce
can
he
want
upon
the
premise
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
question
,
admiral
,
induce
me
to
think
that
we
have
make
another
mistake
.
<EOS>
We
ought
not
to
have
attempt
to
surprise
Sir
Francis
Varney
in
come
into
Bannerworth
Hall
,
but
to
catch
him
as
he
come
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
[

"
<EOS>
well
,
there
be
something
in
that
,
"
say
the
admiral
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
pretty
night
's
business
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
can
not
be
help
,
it
be
do
,
and
there
be
an
end
on't
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
as
the
morning
be
near
at
hand
,
I
certainly
must
confess
I
should
like
to
get
some
breakfast
,
although
I
do
not
like
that
we
should
all
leave
the
house
together
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
"
as
we
have
now
no
secret
to
keep
with
regard
to
our
be
here
,
because
the
principal
person
we
wish
to
keep
it
from
be
aware
of
it
<EOS>
,
I
think
we
can
not
do
better
than
send
at
once
for
Henry
Bannerworth
,
tell
him
of
the
non
-
success
of
the
effort
we
have
make
in
his

,

admit
him
at
once
into
our
consultation
of
what
be
next
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Agreed
,
agree
,
I
think
that
,
without
trouble
him
,
we
may
have
capture
this
Varney
;
but
that
be
over
now
,
and
,
as
soon
as
Jack
Pringle
choose
to
wake
up
again
,
I
will
send
him
to
the
bannerworth
with
a
message
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
,
sir
,
"
say
Jack
,
suddenly
;
"
all
be
right
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
vagabond
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
"
I
do
believe
you
have
be
sham
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
sham
what
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
drunk
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Lor
!
could
not
do
it
,
"
say
Jack
;
"
I
will
just
tell
you
how
it
be
.
<EOS>
I
waken
up
and
find
myself
shut
in
somewhere
;
and
,
as
I
could
not
get
out
of
the
door
,
I
think
I
would
try
the
window
,
and
there
I
do
get
out
.
<EOS>
well
,
perhaps
I
be
not
quite
the
thing
,
but
I
see
two
people
in
the
garden
a
look
up
at
this
ere
room
;
and
,
to
be
sure
,
I
think
it
be
you
and
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
well
,
it
warn't
<EOS>
no
business
of
mine
to
interfere
<EOS>
,
so
I
seed
one
of
you
climb
up
the
balcony
,
as
I
think
,
and
then
,
after
which
,
come
down
head
over
heel
with
such
a
run
,
<EOS>
that
I
think
you
must
have
break
your
neck
.
<EOS>
well
,
after
that
you
fire
a
couple
of
shot
in
,
and
then
,
after
that
,
I
make
sure
it
be
you
,
admiral
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
what
make
you
make
sure
of
that
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
because
you
scuttle
away
like
an
empty
tar
-
barrel
in
full
tide
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
confound
you
,
you
scoundrel

well
,
then
,
confound
you
,
if
it
come
to
that
.

I
think
I
be
do
you
good
sarvice
,
and
that
the
enemy
be
here
,
when
all
the
while
it
turn
out

you

the

be
not

the
enemy
be
outside

you
be
not

<EOS>
"
but
who
throw
such
a
confound
lot
of
thing
into
the
room
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
do
,
of
course
;
I
have
but
one
pistol
,
<EOS>
and
,
when
I
fire
that
off

I
be
force
to
make
up

broadside
with
what
I
could

be
there
ever

a

the

"
doctor

doctor

you
talk
of

make
two

you
forget
a
third

bad

that

Mr.

:
"
come
down
to
the

gate

it
be
now
just
upon
daybreak

the
probability
be
that

shall
not
be
long
there
before
we
see
some
of
the
country
people
,
who
will
get
us
anything
we
require
in
the
shape
of
refreshment
;

as
for

he
seem
quite
sufficiently
recover
now
to
go

Bannerworths
'
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
I
can
go

"

Jack
;
"
<EOS>
as
for
that
,
the
only
thing
as
put
me
out
of
the
way
be
the
want
of
something
to
drink
.

My
constitution
will
not
stand
what
they
call
temperance
living

nothing
with
the
chill
off

<EOS>
"
go
at
once
,

the

tell
Mr.

that
we
be
here
;

do
not
tell
him
before
his
sister

his
mother
.
<EOS>
if
you
meet
anybody
on
the
road
,
send
them
here
with
a
cargo
of
victual

It
strike
me
that
a
good

comfortable
breakfast
would
not

at
all
amiss

<EOS>
"
how
rapidly

day
dawn

"
remark
Mr.

,
as
he
walk
into
the
balcony
from
whence
Varney
,
the
vampire
,
have
attempt
to
make
good
his
entrance
to
the
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
just
as
he
speak
,
and
before
Jack
Pringle
could
get
half
way
over
to
the
garden
gate
,
there
come
a
tremendous
ring
at
the
bell
which
be
suspend
over
it

<EOS>
a
view
of
that
gate
could
not
be

from

so
that

could
not

who
it
be

as
Jack

be
go
down
at
any

they
see
no
necessity
for
personal
interference

he
prove
that
there
be
not

by
presently
return
with
a
note

he

have
be
throw
over
the

great
wonder

at

probably

short
way

at

the
INTERRUPTED

[

notwithstanding
all
Mr.
Chillingworth
could
say
to
the
contrary
,
the
admiral
really
mean
to
breakfast
with
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
 
<EOS>
the
worthy
doctor
could
not
for
some
time
believe
but
that
the
admiral
must
be
joke
,
when
he
talk
in
such
a
strain
;
but
he
be
very
soon
convince
to
the
contrary
,
by
the
latter
actually
walk
out
and
once
more
ask
him
,
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
if
he
mean
to
go
with
him
,
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
conclusive
,
so
the
doctor
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
admiral
,
this
appear
to
me
rather
a
mad
sort
of
freak
;
but
,
as
I
have
begin
the
adventure
with
you
,
I
will
conclude
it
with
you

"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
right

the

I
be
not
deceive
in

doctor

along

hang
these
vampyre
,
I
do
not
know
how
to
tackle
them
,
myself
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
after
all
,
Sir
Francis
Varney
be
more
in
your
line
than
line
be
in
mine
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
could
not
you
persuade
him
he
be
ill
,
and
want
some
physic
?
<EOS>
that
would
soon
settle
him
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
settle
him
!
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
;
"
I
beg
to
say
that
if
I
do
give
him
any
physic
,
the
dose
would
be
much
to
his
advantage
;
but
,
however
,
my
opinion
be
,
that
this
invitation
to
breakfast
be
,
after
all
,
a
mere
piece
of
irony
;
and
that
,
when
we
get
to
Walmesley
Lodge
,
we
shall
not
see
anything
of
him
;
on
the
contrary
,
we
shall
probably
find
it
be
a
hoax
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
should
not
like
that
,
but
still
it
be
worth
the
trying
.
<EOS>
the
fellow
have
really
behave
himself
in
such
an
extraordinary
manner
,
that
,
if
I
can
make
term
with
him
I
will
;
and
there
be
one
thing
,
you
know
,
doctor
,
that
I
think
we
may
say
we
have
discover
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
what
may
that
be
?
<EOS>
be
it
,
not
to
make
too
sure
of
a
vampyre
,
even
when
you
have
him
by
the
leg
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
that
be
not
it
,
though
that
be
a
very
good
thing
in
its
way
:
but
it
be
just
this
,
that
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
whoever
he
be
and
whatever
he
be
,
be
after
Bannerworth
Hall
,
and
not
the
Bannerworth
family
.
<EOS>
if
you
recollect
,
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
in
our
conversation
,
I
have
always
insist
upon
that
fact
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
;
and
it
seem
to
me
to
be
completely
verify
by
the
proceeding
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
there
,
then
,
admiral
,
be
the
great
mystery
--
what
can
he
want
at
Bannerworth
Hall
that
make
him
take
such
a
world
of
trouble
,
and
run
so
many
fearful
risk
in
try
to
get
at
it
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
is
,
indeed
,
the
mystery
;
and
if
he
really
mean
this
invitation
to
breakfast
,
I
shall
ask
him
plumply
,
and
tell
him
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
possibly
his
very
good
way
to
secure
his
object
will
be
to
be
candid
,
vampyre
as
he
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
really
,
admiral
,
you
do
not
still
cling
to
that
foolish
superstition
of
believe
that
Sir
Francis
Varney
be
in
reality
a
vampyre
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
and
I
can
not
say
;
if
anybody
be
to
give
me
a
description
of
a
strange
sort
of
fish
that
I
have
never
see
,
I
would
not
take
upon
myself
to
say
there
be
not
such
a
thing
;
nor
would
you
,
doctor
,
if
you
have
really
see
the
many
odd
one
that
I
have
encounter
at
various
time

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
admiral
,
I
be
certainly
not
belong
to
that
school
of
philosophy
which
declare
the
impossible
to
be
what
it
do
not
understand
;
there
may
be
vampyre
,
and
there
may
be
apparition
,
for
all
I
know
to
the
contrary
;
I
only
doubt
these
thing
,
because
I
think
,
if
they
be
true
,
that
,
as
a
phenomena
of
nature
,
they
would
have
be
by
this
time
establish
by
repeat
instance

the
possibility

doubt

cavil

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

well

there
be
something
in
that
;

how
far
have
we
get
to
go
now
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
further
than
to
yon
enclosure

you

looking

that
cedar

tree
stretch
its
dark

green

Mr.

when
they
reach
the
gate

know

the

more

wring

open
the
garden
gate

they
walk
up
a
trimly
lay
out
garden
to
the
lodge
,
which
be
a
cottage
-
like
structure
in
external
appearance
,
although
within
it
boast
of
all
the
comfort
of
a
tolerably
extensive
house

<EOS>
She
leave
them
in
a
small
room
,
lead
from
the
hall
,
and
be
absent
about
five
minute
;
then
she
return
,
and
,
merely
say
that
Sir
Francis
Varney
present
his
compliment
,
and
desire
them
to
walk
up
stair
,
she
precede
them
up
a
handsome
flight
which
lead
to
the
first
floor
of
the
lodge

<EOS>
up
to
this
moment
,
Mr.
Chillingworth
have
expect
some
excuse
,
for
,
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
he
have
hear
and
see
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
he
could
not
believe
that
any
amount
of
impudence
would
suffice
to
enable
him
to
receive
people
as
his
guest
,
with
whom
he
must
feel
that
he
be
at
such
positive
war
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
singular
circumstance
;
and
,
perhaps
,
the
only
thing
that
match
the
cool
impertinence
of
the
invitation
,
be
the
acceptance
of
it
under
the
circumstance
by
the
admiral
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
may
have
intend
it
as
a
jest
;
but
if
he
do
so
,
in
the
first
instance
,
it
be
evident
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
beat
with
his
own
weapon
.
 
<EOS>
the
room
into
which
they
be
show
be
a
longish
narrow
one
;
a
very
wide
door
give
them
admission
to
it
,
at
the
end
,
nearest
the
staircase
,
and
at
its
other
extremity
there
be
a
similar
door
opening
into
some
other
apartment
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
sit
with
his
back
towards
this
second
door
,
and
a
table
,
with
some
chair
and
other
article
of
furniture
,
be
so
arrange
before
him
,
that
while
they
seem
but
to
be
carelessly
place
in
the
position
they
occupy
,
they
really
form
a
pretty
good
barrier
between
him
and
his
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
the
admiral
,
however
,
be
too
intent
upon
get
a
sight
of
Varney
,
to
notice
any
preparation
of
this
sort
,
and
he
advance
quickly
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
and
there
,
indeed
,
be
the
much
dreaded
,
troublesome
,
persevere
,
and
singular
looking
be
who
have
cause
such
a
world
of
annoyance
to
the
family
of
the
Bannerworths
,
as
well
as
disturb
the
peace
of
the
whole
district
,
which
have
the
misfortune
to
have
him
as
an
inhabitant
.
 
<EOS>
if
anything
,
he
look
thin
,
tall
,
and
paler
than
usual
,
and
there
seem
to
be
a
slight
nervousness
of
manner
about
him
,
as
he
slowly
incline
his
head
towards
the
admiral
,
which
be
not
quite
intelligible
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Admiral
Bell
,
"
you
invite
me
to
breakfast

learned

<EOS>
"
no
two
human
being

Varney

be
more
welcome

my
hospitality

I
pray
you
to
be
seat
.
<EOS>
what
a
pleasant
thing
it
be
,
after
the
toil
and
struggle
of
this
life
,
occasionally
to
sit
down
in
the
sweet
companionship
of
such
dear
friend
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
make
a
hideous
face
as
he
speak
,
and
the
admiral
look
as
if
he
be
half
incline
to
quarrel
at
that
early
stage
of
the
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
"
dear
friend
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
;
"
well

well

it

no

squabble

of
the

in
a

tolerably
cover
with
the
material
for
a
substantial
morning
's
meal

She
place
it
upon
the
table

certainly
the

upon
it

great
credit

open
his

enormous
width

<EOS>
"
that

looking
man
,
well
dressed

but
with
a
very
odd
look
upon
his

Hall

Admiral

it

cruel

not
well
do
of
you

to
attempt
such
an
enterprise

do
you
suppose

who
have
the
great
interest

this
affair

would
have
shrink
from
danger
,

danger
there
be

lack
perseverance

I
take
it
ill
that
I

keep
out

it

be
sedulously

It

I

confess

what

therefore

there
be
an
end

<EOS>
now
,
I
tell
you
what
,
Henry

Sir
Francis
Varney

within

at

,
I
have
reason

<EOS>

then
,
"
exclaim
Henry

impetuously
,
"
I
will
wring
from
him
answer
to
various
question
which
concern
my
peace
and
happiness
.

"
 
<EOS>
"
please
,
gentleman
,

say
the
woman
Deborah
,
make
her
appearance
,
"
Sir
Francis
Varney
have
go
out
,
and
he
say
I
be
to
show
you
all
the
door
,
as
soon
as
it
be
convenient
for
you
all
to
walk
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
feel
convinced
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
"
that
it
will
be
a
useless
search
now
to
attempt
to
find
Sir
Francis
Varney
here
.
<EOS>
let
me
beg
of
you
all
to
come
away
;
and
believe
me
that
I
do
not
speak
lightly
,
or
with
a
view
to
get
you
from
here
,
when
I
say
,
that
after
I
have
hear
something
from
you
,
Henry
,
which
I
shall
ask
you
to
relate
to
me
,
painful
though
it
may
be
,
I
shall
be
able
to
suggest
some
explanation
of
many
thing
which
appear
at
present
obscure
,
and
to
put
you
in
a
course
of
free
you
from
the
difficulty
which
surround
you
,
which
,
Heaven
know
,
I
little
expect
I
should
have
it
in
my
power
to
propose
to
any
of
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
follow
your
advice
,
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
"
say
Henry
;
"
for
I
have
always
find
that
it
have
be
dictate
by
good
feeling
as
well
as
correct
judgment
.
<EOS>
Admiral
Bell
,
you
will
oblige
me
much
by
come
away
with
me
now
and
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
remark
the
admiral
,
"
if
the
doctor
have
really
something
to
say
,
it
alter
the
appearance
of
thing
,
and
,
of
course
,
I
have
no
objection
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
upon
this
,
the
whole
three
of
them
immediately
leave
the
place
,
and
it
be
evident
that
Mr.
Chillingworth
have
something
of
an
uncomfortable
character
upon
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
be
unusually
silent
and
reserved
,
and
,
when
he
do
speak
,
he
seem
rather
inclined
to
turn
the
conversation
upon
indifferent
topic
,
than
to
add
anything
more
to
what
he
have
say
upon
the
deeply
interesting
one
which
hold
so
foremost
a
place
in
all
their
mind
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
be
Flora
,
now
,
"
he
ask
of
Henry
,
"
since
her
removal
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
anxious
still
,
"
say
Henry
;
"
but
,
I
think
,
better
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
well
.
<EOS>
I
perceive
that
,
naturally
,
we
be
all
three
walk
towards
Bannerworth
Hall
,
and
,
perhaps
<EOS>
,
it
be
as
well
that
on
that
spot
I
should
ask
of
you
,
Henry
,
to
indulge
me
with
a
confidence
such
as
,
under
ordinary
circumstance

I
should
not
at
all
feel
myself
justified
in
require
of
you

<EOS>

to
what
do
it
relate

"
say
Henry
.
<EOS>
"

declare
that

now
a

grievous

him

answer
to
an
inquiring
glance
from
Mr.

that

<EOS>

,
"

happen

there
be
some
truth

Henry

sadly
;

,
however
,
let
me
proceed
;
since
I
have
to
tell
the
tale

I
could
wish
it
over
.
<EOS>
My

vice

by
the
force
of
bad
associate

and
a
sort
of
want
of
congeniality
and
sentiment
that
spring
up
between
him
and
my
mother
,
plunge
into
all
the
excess
of
his
age

"
 
<EOS>
"
these
excess
be
all
of
that
character
which
the
most
readily
lie
hold
strongly
of
an
unreflecting
mind

they
all
present
themselves
in
the
garb
of
sociality

"
the
wine
cup

drain
in

money
which

want
for
legitimate

squander
under
the
mask
of
a
noble

free
generosity

all
that
the
small
imagination
of
a
number
of

enable

my

incline
to
come
to
an
opinion
that
the
word
he
so
uttered
be
<EOS>
but
the
result
of
the
mental
disturbance
that
at
such
a
moment
may
well
be
suppose
to
be
ensue
in
the
mind
,
and
that
they
relate
really
to
no
foregone
fact
any
more
than
some
incoherent
word
utter
by
a
man
in
a
dream
may
be
suppose
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
,
"
remark
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
"
for
one
moment
to
attempt
to
dispute
,
Henry
,
the
rationality
of
such
an
opinion
as
you
have
just
give
utterance
to
;
but
you
forget
that
another
circumstance
occur
,
which
give
a
colour
to
the
word
use
by
your
father

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
know
to
what
you
allude

so
good

it
to
the

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

I
will
.
<EOS>
on
the
evening
of
that

day
there
come
a
man
here
,
who
,
in
seem
ignorance
of
what
have
occur
,
although
by
that
time
it
be
well
known

"
upon
be
tell
that
he
be
dead
,
he
start
back
,
either
with
well
act

with
real
surprise

seem
to
be
immensely
chagrin
.
<EOS>
He
then
demand
to
know
if
he
have
leave
any
disposition
of
his
property
;

he
get
no
information

the

diabolical

can

He
mount
his
horse
,
for
he
have
ride
to
the
Hall

his

be
,
as
I
be
told--

he
have

do

ask
the

"
It
be
,
"
say
Mr.

full
of
mystery
.
<EOS>
the
public

be
much
take
up
at

time
with

it
would
have

commotion
for

<EOS>
"
yes

Henry
;
"
it
so
happen
that
about

very
time
a
murder

which
baffle
all
the
exertion

murder
of

"
 
<EOS>
"
oh

I
remember

They
be
;

so
,
as
Mr.

,
the
more
exciting
interest
which
that
affair
create
draw
off
public
attention
,
in
a
great
measure
,
from
my
father
's
suicide
,
and
we
do
not
suffer
so
much
from
public
remark
and
from
impertinent
curiosity
as
may
have
be
expect
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
and
,
in
addition

Mr.

he
change
colour
a
little
as
he
speak

be
an
execution

afterwards

<EOS>

true
;
all
the
affair

you
do

"
oh

yes

I
be
quite
well

you

"
 
<EOS>
both
the
admiral
and
Henry
look
scrutinizingly
at
the
doctor
,
who
certainly
appear
to
them
to
be
labour
under
some
great
mental
excitement
,
which
he
find
it
almost
beyond
his
power

repress

I

far
enough

under

have
laugh

these
singular

Jack

yes

nothing

to
take

in

I

do
not

from

CHAPTER
LXII
.
 
<EOS>
the
MYSTERIOUS
MEETING
in
the
RUIN
AGAIN.--THE
VAMPYRE
's
ATTACK
upon
the
CONSTABLE
.
  
<EOS>
[
illustration
]
 
<EOS>
It
be
now
necessary
that
we
return
once
more
to
that
mysterious
ruin
,
in
the
intricacy
of
which
Varney
,
when
pursue
by
the
mob
,
have
succeed
in
find
a
refuge
which
defy
all
the
exertion
which
be
make
for
his
discovery
.
<EOS>
Our
reader
must
be
well
aware
,
that
,
connect
with
that
ruin
,
be
some
secret
of
great
importance
to
our
story
;
and
we
will
now
,
at
the
solemn
hour
of
midnight
,
take
another
glance
at
what
be
do
within
its
recess
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
solemn
hour
it
be
not
probable
that
any
one
would
seek
that
gloomy
place
from
choice
.
<EOS>
some
lover
of
the
picturesque
certainly
may
visit
it
;
but
such
be
not
the
incite
cause
of
the
pilgrimage
with
those
who
be
soon
to
stand
within
its
gloomy
precinct
.
 
<EOS>
other
motive
dictate
their
presence
in
that
spot
--
motive
of
rapine
;
peradventure
of
murder
itself
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
neighbouring
clock
sound
the
hour
of
twelve
,
and
the
faint
stroke
be
bear
gently
on
the
wind
to
that
isolate
ruin
,
there
may
have
be
see
a
tall
man
stand
by
the
porch
of
what
have
once
be
a
large
doorway
to
some
portion
of
the
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
His
form
be
envelop
in
a
large
cloak
,
which
be
of
such
ample
material
that
he
seem
well
able
to
wrap
it
several
time
around
him
,
and
then
leave
a
considerable
portion
of
it
float
idly
in
the
gentle
wind
.
 
<EOS>
He
stand
as
still
,
as
calm
,
and
as
motionless
as
a
statue
,
for
a
considerable
time
,
before
any
degree
of
impatience
begin
to
show
itself
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
take
from
his
pocket
a
large
antique
watch
,
the
white
face
of
which
just
enable
him
to
see
what
the
time
be
,
and
,
in
a
voice
which
have
in
it
some
amount
of
petulance
and
anger
<EOS>
,
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
not
come
yet
,
and
nearly
half
an
hour
beyond
the
time
!
<EOS>
what
can
have
detain
him
?
<EOS>
this
be
,
indeed
,
trifle
with
the
most
important
moment
of
a
man
's
existence
.
"
 
<EOS>
even
as
he
speak
,
he
hear
,
from
some
distance
off
,
the
sound
of
a
short
,
quick
footstep
.
<EOS>
He
bend
forwards
to
listen
,
and
then
,
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
,
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
He
come
--
he
come
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
he
who
thus
wait
for
some
confederate
among
these
dim
and
old
grey
ruin
,
advance
not
a
step
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
such
seem
the
amount
of
cold
-
blooded
caution
which
he
possess
,
that
the
near
the
man
--
who
be
evidently
advance
--
get
to
the
place
,
the
further
back
do
he
who
have
precede
him
shrink
into
the
shadow
of
the
dim
and
crumble
wall
,
which
have
,
for
some
year
now
past
,
seem
to
bend
to
the
pass
blast
,
and
to
be
on
the
point
of
yield
to
the
destroy
hand
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
,
surely
he
need
not
have
be
so
cautious
.
<EOS>
who
be
likely
,
at
such
an
hour
as
that
,
to
come
to
the
ruin
,
but
one
who
seek
it
by
appointment
?
 
<EOS>
and
,
moreover
,
the
manner
of
the
advance
man
should
have
be
quite
sufficient
to
convince
him
who
wait
,
that
so
much
caution
be
unnecessary
;
but
it
be
a
part
and
parcel
of
his
nature
.
 
<EOS>
about
three
minute
more
sufficed
to
bring
the
second
man
to
the
ruin
,
and
<EOS>
he
,
at
once
,
and
fearlessly
,
plunge
into
its
recess
.
 
<EOS>
"
who
come
?
"
say
the
first
man
,
in
a
deep
,
hollow
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
whom
you
expect
,
"
be
the
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
,
"
he
say
,
and
at
once
he
now
emerge
from
his
hiding
-
place
,
and
they
stand
together
in
the
nearly
total
darkness
with
which
the
place
be
enshroud
;
for
the
night
be
a

there
appear
not
a
star
in
the
heavens
,
to
shed
its
faint
light
upon
the
scene
below
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
few
moment
they
be
both
silent
,
for
he
who
have
last
arrive
have
evidently
make
great
exertion
to
reach
the
spot
,
and
be
breathe
laboriously
,
while
he
who
be
there
first
appear
,
from
some
natural
taciturnity
of
character
,
to
decline
open
the
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
the
second
comer
speak
,
saying,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
make
some
exertion
to
get
here
to
my
time
,
and
yet
I
be
beyond
it

you
be
no

aware

"
 
<EOS>
"
yes

yes

"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
such
would

the

to
bring
you
some
news
of
importance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
so
.
<EOS>
this
place
,
which
we
have
,
now
for
some
time
have
as
a
quiet
and
perfectly
eligible
one
of
meeting
,
be
about
to
be
invade
by
one
of
those
restless
,
troublesome
spirit

who
be
never
happy

when
they
be
contrive
something
to
the
annoyance
of
other
who
do
not
interfere
with
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
explain
yourself
more
fully
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
.
<EOS>
at
a
tavern
in
the
town
,
there
have
happen
some
strange
scene
of
violence
,
in
consequence
of
the
general
excitement
into
which
the
common
people
have
be
throw
upon
the
dreadful
subject
of
vampyre
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
consequence
be
,
that
numerous
arrest
have
take
place
,
and
the
place
of
confinement
for
offender
against
the
law
be
now
full
of
those
whose
heated
and
angry
imagination
have
induce
them
to
take
violent
step
to
discover
the
reality
or
the
falsehood
of
rumour
which
so
much
affect
them
,
their
wife
,
and
their
family
,
that
they
fear
to
lie
down
to
their
night
's
repose
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
other
laugh
a
short
,
hollow
,
restless
sort
of
laugh
,
which
have
not
one
particle
of
real
mirth
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
go
on

go
on

what
do
they
do
?

"
 
<EOS>

excess

be

what
make
me
,
first
of
all

beyond
my

be
that
I
overhear
a
man
declare
his
intention
this
night
,
from
twelve
till
the
morning
,

for
some
night
to
come

to
hold
watch

for
the
vampyre

"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
!

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
He
do
but
stay
,
at
the
earnest

of
his
comrade
,
to
take
yet
another
glass
,
ere
he
come
upon
his
expedition

He
must
be

the
idiot

what
business

it
of
his
?

there

people

will
make
everything
their

it

"
there
be
.
<EOS>
let
us
retire
further
into
the
recess
of
the
ruin

there
consider
as
well

be

regard
more
important
affair

with
this
rash
intruder
here

"
 
<EOS>
They
both
walk
for
some
twenty
pace
,
or
so
,
right
into
the
ruin
,
and
then
he
who
have
be
there
first
,
say
,
suddenly
,
to
his
companion,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
annoy
,
although
the
feeling
reach
no
further
than
annoyance

I

a
natural
love

Your

yes

there

out
unawares

Can
it
be
possible
that
you
have
so
little
command

yourself

come
from
your

I

surprised

it
can
not

what
do
you
now
propose
to
do

<EOS>
"
nay

you
be
my
privy
councillor

have
you
no

artful

<EOS>
Can
you
not
plan
and
arrange
something
which
may
yet
have
the
effect
of
accomplish
what
at
first
seem
so
very
simple
,

which
have
,
from
one
unfortunate
circumstance

another

become
full

"
 
<EOS>

I
must
confess
I
have
no
plan

listen
with
astonishment

now

you

you
ever

"
not
often

I
admit
.
<EOS>

you
have
a
fertile
genius
,

<EOS>
I
have
always
,
myself
,
find
it
easy
to
be
the
executive
than
to
plan
an
elaborate
course
of
action
for
other
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
throw
it
all
on
me
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
throw
a
weight
,
naturally
enough
,
upon
the
shoulder
which
I
think
the
best
adapt
to
sustain
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

be
it
so

be
it
so

<EOS>
"
You
be

I
presume
,
from
what
you
say
,
provide
with
a
scheme
of
action
which
shall
present
well
hope
of
success
,
at
less
risk

I
hope

<EOS>
look
what
great
danger
we
have
already
pass
through

yes

we
have

I
pray
you
avoid
that
in
the
next
campaign

It
be
not
the
danger
that
annoy

trouble
me

it

it

off

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
not
only
so
,

,
as
be
invariably
the
case
under
such
circumstance

we
have
make
it
more
difficult
of
execution

we

put
those
upon

guard
thoroughly

be
the
most
likely

oppose
us

the

stand

become
a
heap
of
ruin

where
fire
shall
do
its

myself
find

well

I
quarrel
with
no

out

do
with

no

get
out

so

all

fail

know
of
a
marvellously
ready
way

get
rid

such
encumbrance

I
must
own

that
I
shrink
with
more
than
a
feeling

reluctance
from
the
murder
of
the
youth

You
contemplate
it
then

ask
the
other

no

I
can
not

<EOS>
"
what
be
then
?
"
 
<EOS>

to
contemplate
a

me

close

you

no

what

more
I

that
be
sufficient

the
only
question
that
remain
for
you
to
confide

be

what
you
will
do

It
be
far
easy
in
all
enterprise

decide
upon
what
we

not
do

upon
what
we
will

for
my

part
I
must
say

I
can
perceive
no
mode

extricate
ourselves

this
involvement

anything

safety

say
so

your

can
guess
how
much

be
dissatisfy

the
aspect

affair

dissatisfy

yes

dissatisfied

own
that
which
it

conceal
from
me

know

call
for

down

no

no

that
,
even
when
he
consider
that
his
life
be
at
stake
,
enable
him
to
say
no
to
a
proposal
which
be
cowardly
and
dishonourable
,
although
it
go
far
to
the
defeat
of
my
own
plan
and
have
involve
me
in
much
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
hush
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
I
hear
a
footstep
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
;
that
be
a
novelty
in
such
a
place
as
this
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
yet
not
more
than
I
expect
.
<EOS>
have
you
forget
what
I
tell
you
when
I
reach
here
to
-
night
after
the
appoint
hour
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
truly
;
I
have
for
the
moment
.
<EOS>
do
you
think
then
that
the
footstep
which
now
meet
our
ear
,
be
that
of
the
adventurer
who
boast
that
he
could
keep
watch
for
the
vampyre
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
in
faith
do
I.
<EOS>
what
be
to
be
do
with
such
a
meddle
fool
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
ought
certainly
to
be
teach
not
to
be
so
fond
of
interfere
with
other
people
's
affair
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
perchance
the
lesson
will
not
be
wholly
throw
away
upon
other
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
worth
while
to
take
some
trouble
with
this
poor
valiant
fellow
,
and
let
him
spread
his
news
so
as
to
stop
any
one
else
from
be
equally
venturous
and
troublesome
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
good
thought
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
it
be
do
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
if
you
will
arrange
that
which
shall
accomplish
such
a
result
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
it
so
.
<EOS>
the
moon
rise
soon
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
already
I
fancy
I
see
a
brightening
of
the
air
as
if
the
mellow
radiance
of
the
queen
of
night
be
already
quietly
diffuse
itself
throughout
the
realm
of
space
.
<EOS>
come
further
within
the
ruin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
both
walk
further
among
the
crumble
wall
and
fragment
of
column
with
which
the
place
abound
.
<EOS>
as
they
do
so
they
pause
now
and
then
to
listen
,
and
more
than
once
they
both
hear
plainly
the
sound
of
certain
footstep
immediately
outside
the
once
handsome
and
spacious
building
.
 
<EOS>
Varney
,
the
vampyre

who
have

this
conversation
with
no

than
Marchdale

smile
as
he
,
in
a
whisper
voice
,
tell
the
latter
what
to
do
in

to
frighten
away
from

place

foolhardy
man
who
think
that
,

himself
,
he
should
be
able
to
accomplish
anything
against
the
vampyre
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
,
indeed
,
a
hair
-
brain
expedition
,
for
whether
Sir
Francis
Varney
be
really
so
awful
and
preternatural
a
being
as
so
many
concurrent
circumstance
would
seem
to
proclaim

he
be
not

by
anyone
individual
,
let
his
power
or
his
courage
be
what
they
may

<EOS>
what
induce
this
man
to
become
so
ventursome
we
shall
now
proceed
to
relate
,
as
well
as
<EOS>
what
kind
of
reception
he
get
in
the
old
ruin
,
which
,
since
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
within

<EOS>
the
GUESTS
<EOS>
at
<EOS>
the
INN
,
and
the
STORY
of
the
dead
UNCLE
.
  
<EOS>
[

<EOS>
as
have
be
truly
state
by
Mr.
Marchdale
,
who
now
stand
out
in
his
true
colour
to
the
reader
as
the
confidant
and
abettor
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
there
have
assemble
on
that
evening
a
curious
and
a
gossippe
party
at
the
inn
where
such
dreadful
and
such
riotous
proceeding
have
take
place
,
which
,
in
their
proper
place
,
we
have
already
duly
and
at
length
record
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
very
likely
that
,
on
that
evening
,
or
for
many
and
many
an
evening
to
come
,
the
conversation
in
the
parlour
of
the
inn
would
be
upon
any
other
subject
than
that
of
the
vampyre
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
strange
,
mysterious
,
and
horrible
circumstance
which
have
occur
,
bade
fair
to
be
gossippe
stock
in
trade
for
many
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
never
before
have
a
subject
present
so
many
curious
feature
arise
.
<EOS>
never
,
within
the
memory
of
that
personage
who
be
suppose
to
know
everything
,
have
there
occur
any
circumstance
in
the
county
,
or
set
of
circumstance
,
which
afford
such
abundant
scope
for
conjecture
and
speculation
.
 
<EOS>
everybody
may
have
his
individual
opinion
,
and
be
just
as
likely
to
be
right
as
his
neighbour
;
and
the
beauty
of
the
affair
be
,
that
such
be
the
interest
of
the
subject
itself
,
that
there
be
sure
to
be
a
kind
of
reflected
interest
with
every
surmise
that
at
all
bear
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
[

<EOS>
on
this
particular
night
,
when
Marchdale
be
prowl
about
,
gather
what
news
<EOS>
he
could
,
in
order
that
he
may
carry
it
to
the
vampyre
,
a
more
than
usually
strong
muster
of
the
gossip
of
the
town
take
place
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
all
of
any
note
in
the
talking
way
be
there
,
with
the
exception
of
one
,
and
he
be
in
the
county
gaol
,
be
one
of
the
prisoner
apprehend
by
the
military
when
they
make
the
successful
attack
upon
the
lumber
-
room
of
the
inn
,
after
the
dreadful
desecration
of
the
dead
which
have
take
place
.
 
<EOS>
the
landlord
of
the
inn
be
likely
to
make
a
good
thing
of
it
,
for
talk
make
people
thirsty
;
and
he
begin
to
consider
that
a
vampyre
about
once
a
-
year
would
be
no
bad
thing
for
the
Blue
Lion
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
shocking
,
"
say
one
of
the
guest
;
<EOS>
"
it
be
shocking
to
think
of
.
<EOS>
only
last
night
,
I
be
quite
sure
I
have
such
a
fright
that
it
add
at
least
ten
year
to
my
age
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
fright
!
"
say
several
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
speak
English
--
I
say
a
fright
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
but
have
it
anything
to
do
with
the
vampyre
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
everything
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh

tell
us
;

us
all
about
it

<EOS>

it
?
<EOS>
do
he
come
to
you
?
<EOS>
go
on
.
<EOS>
well
,
well
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
first
speaker
become
immediately
a
very
important
personage
in
the
room
;
and
,
when
he
see
that
,
he
become
at
once
a
very
important
personage
in
his
own
eye
likewise
;
and
,
before
he
would
speak
another
word
,
he
fill
a
fresh
pipe
,
and
order
another
mug
of
ale
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
no
use
try
to
hurry
him
,
"
say
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
he
say
,
"

be
not

<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
in
good
time
what
a
dreadful
circumstance
have
make
me
sixty
-
three
to

day
,
when
I
be
only
fifty

three
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
it
very
dreadful

<EOS>
"
rather
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
have
survive
it
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
now
listen
.
<EOS>
I
go
to
bed
at
a
quarter
after
eleven
,
as
usual
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
notice
anything
particular
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
peep
under
the
bed
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
well
,
as
I
be
a
-
saying
,
to
bed
I
go
,
and
I
do
not
fasten
the
door
;
because
,
be
a
very
sound
sleeper
,
in
case
there
be
a
fire
<EOS>
,
I
should
not
hear
a
word
of
it
if
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
another
.
<EOS>
"
I
recollect
once--
<EOS>
"
 
"
be
so
good
as
allow
me
to
finish
what
I
know
,
before
you
begin
to
recollect
anything
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
as
I
be
say
,
I
do
not
lock
the
door
,
but
I
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
somehow
or
another
,
I
do
not
feel
at
all
comfortable
,
and
I
toss
about
,
first
on
one
side
,
and
then
on
the
other
;
but
it
be
all
in
vain
;
I
only
get
,
every
moment
,
more
and
more
fidgetty
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
do
you
think
of
the
vampyre
?
"
say
one
of
the
listener
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
of
nothing
else
till
I
hear
my
clock
,
which
be
on
the
landing
of
the
stair
above
my
bed
-
room
,
begin
to
strike
twelve
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
I
like
to
hear
a
clock
sound
in
the
night
,
"
say
one
;
"
it
put
one
in
mind
of
the
rest
of
the
world
,
and
let
one
know
one
be
not
all
alone
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
good
.
<EOS>
the
striking
of
the
clock
I
should
not
at
all
have
object
to
;
but
it
be
what
follow
that
do
the
business
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
,
what
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Fair
and
softly
;
fair
and
softly
.
<EOS>
just
hand
me
a
light
,
Mr.
Sprigs
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
all
,
gentleman
,
in
a
moment
or
two
.
"
 
<EOS>
with
the
most
provoking
deliberation
,
the
speaker
re
-
light
his
pipe
,
which
have
go
out
while
he
be
talk
,
and
then
,
after
a
few
whiff
,
to
assure
himself
that
its
content
have
thoroughly
ignite
<EOS>
,
he
resumed,--
 
<EOS>
"
no
sooner
have
the
last
sound
of
it
die
away
,
than
I
hear
something
on
the
stair
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
as
if
some
man
have
give
his
foot
a
hard
blow
against
one
of
the
stair
;
and
he
would
have
need
to
have
have
a
heavy
boot
on
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
start
up
in
bed
and
listen
,
as
you
may
well
suppose
,
not
in
the
most
tranquil
state
of
mind
,
and
then
I
hear
an
odd
,
gnaw
sort
of
noise
,
and
then
another
dab
upon
one
of
the
stair
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
dreadful
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
.
<EOS>
what
to
do
I
know
not
,
or
what
to
think
,
except
that
the
vampyre
have
,
by
some
mean
,
get
in
at
the
attic
window
,
and
be
come
down
stair
to
my
room
.
<EOS>
that
seem
the
most
likely
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
another
groan
,
and
then
another
heavy
step
;
and
,
as
they
be
evidently
come
towards
my
door
,
I
feel
accordingly
,
and
get
out
of
bed
,
not
know
hardly
whether
I
be
on
my
head
or
my
heel
,
to
try
and
lock
my
door
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
that
be
all
very
well
,
if
I
could
have
do
it
;
but
a
man
in
such
a
state
of
mind
as
I
be
in
be
not
a
very
sharp
hand
at
do
anything
.
<EOS>
I
shake
from
head
to
foot
.
<EOS>
the
room
be
very
dark
,
and
I
could
not
,
for
a
moment
or
two
,
collect
my
sense
sufficient
really
to
know
which
way
the
door
lie
.

<EOS>
"
what
a
situation
!

"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
.
<EOS>
Dab
,
dab
,
dab
,
come
these
horrid
footstep
,
and
there
be
I
grope
about
the
room
in
an
agony
.
<EOS>
I
hear
them
come
nearer
and
near
to
my
door
.
<EOS>
another
moment
,
and
they
must
have
reach
it
,
when
my
hand
strike
against
the
lock
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
an
escape
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
it
be
not

"
 
<EOS>
"
no

"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
the
key
be
on
the
outside
,
and
you
may
well
guess
I
be
not
over
and
above
dispose
to
open
the
door
to
get
at
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
feel
regularly
bewilder
,
I
can
tell
you
;
it
seem
to
me
as
if
the
very
devil
himself
be
come
down
stair
hop
all
the
way
upon
one
leg
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
terrific
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
feel
my
sense
almost
leave
me
;
but
I
do
what
I
could
to
hold
the
door
shut
just
as
I
hear
the
strange
step
come
from
the
last
stair
on
to
the
landing
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
a
horrid
sound
,
and
some
one
begin
try
the
lock
of
my
door
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
a
moment
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
can
tell
you
it
be
a
moment
.
<EOS>
such
a
moment
as
I
do
not
wish
to
go
through
again
.
<EOS>
I
hold
the
door
as
close
as
I
could
,
and
do
not
speak
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
cry
out
help
and
murder
,
but
I
could
not
;
my
tongue
stick
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
,

my
strength
be
fast
fail
me

Horrid

horrid
!

"
take
a
drop
of
ale

<EOS>
"
thank
you

<EOS>
well
,
I
do
not

on
above
two

three
minute
,

all
the
while
some
one
try
might

main
to
push
open

My
strength

me
all
at

I
have
only
time
to
stagger
back
a
step

two

then
,
as

door
open

I
faint
away

I
can
not
tell
you
;
but
the
first
thing
I
see
when
I
recover
be
a
candle
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
.
"
 
"
and
then
a
crowd
of
people
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
ah
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
then
Dr.
Web
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
gracious
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
.
Mrs.
Bulk
,
my
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
I
be
in
my
own
bed
,
and
when
I
open
my
eye
<EOS>
I
hear
Dr.
Webb
<EOS>
say,--
 
<EOS>
"
'
He
will
be
well
soon
.
<EOS>
Can
no
one
form
any
idea
of
what
it
be
all
about
.
<EOS>
some
sudden
fright
surely
could
alone
have
produce
such
an
effect
.
'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
the
Lord
have
mercy
upon
me
!
'
<EOS>
say
I.
 
"
upon
this
everybody
who
have
be
call
in
get
round
the
bed
,
and
want
to
know
what
have
happen
;
but
I
say
not
a
word
of
it
;
but
turn
to
Mrs.
Bulk
,
I
ask
her
how
it
be
<EOS>
she
find
out
I
have
faint
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
why
,
sir
,
'
say
she
,
'
I
be
come
up
to
bed
as
softly
as
I
could
,
because
I
know
you
have
go
to
rest
some
time
before
.
<EOS>
the
clock
be
strike
twelve
,
and
as
I
go
past
it
some
of
my
clothe
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
catch
the
large
weight
,
but
it
be
knock
off
,
and
down
the
stair
it
roll
,
go
with
such
a
lump
from
one
to
the
other
,
and
I
could
not
catch
it
because
it
roll
so
fast
,
that
I
make
sure
you
would
be
awaken
;
so
I
come
down
to
tell
you
what
it
be
,
and
it
be
some
time
before
I
could
get
your
room
door
open
,
and
<EOS>
when
I
do
I
find
you
out
of
bed
and
insensible
.
'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
general
look
of
disappointment
when
this
explanation
be
give
,
and
one
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
then
it
be
not
the
vampire
?
"
 
"
certainly
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
,
after
all
,
only
a
clock
weight
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
about
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
do
not
you
tell
us
that
at
first
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
because
that
would
have
spoil
the
story
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
general
murmur
of
discontent
,
and
,
after
a
few
moment
one
man
say
,
with
some
vivacity,--
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
although
our
friend
's
vampyre
have
turn
out
,
after
all
,
to
be
nothing
but
a
confound
clock
-
weight
,
there
be
no
dispute
the
fact
about
Sir
Francis
Varney
be
a
vampyre
,
and
not
a
clock
-
weight
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
true
--
very
true
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

and
what
be
to
be
do
to
rid
the
town
of
such
a
man
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
do
not
call
him
a
man

"
 
<EOS>

well
,
a
monster

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
that
be
more
like

<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
,
sir

if
you
have
get
a
light
,
when
you
first
hear
the
noise
in
your
room

go
out
to
see
what
it
be

you
would
have
spare
yourself
much
fright

"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
no
doubt
;
it
be
always
easy
afterwards
to
say
,
if
you
have
do
this
,
and
if
you
have
do
the
other
,
so
and
so
would
have
be
the
effect
;
but
there
be
something
about
the
hour
of
midnight
that
make
man
tremble

"
 
<EOS>
"
well

"
say
one
,
who
have
not

I
do
not

why
twelve
at
night
should

more
disagreeable

twelve
at

do
not
you

not

Sir

unaccountably
disappear
in
broad
daylight

well

handkerchief
of
mine
;
I
should
know
it
again
among
a
hundred
other
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
agree
;
I
will
leave
it
in
the
ruin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
wager
be
fairly
agree
upon
;
several
handkerchief
be
hand
to
Tom
Eccles
;
and
at
eleven
o'clock
he
fairly
start
,
through
the
murky
darkness
of
the
night
,
to
the
old
ruin
where
Sir
Francis
Varney
and
Marchdale
be
hold
their
most
unholy
conference
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
one
thing
to
talk
and
to
accept
wager
in
the
snug
parlour
of
an
inn
,
and
another
to
go
alone
across
a
tract
of
country
wrap
in
the
profound
stillness
of
night
to
an
ancient
ruin
which
,
in
addition
to
the
natural
gloom
which
may
well
be
suppose
to
surround
it
,
have
superadde
association
which
be
anything
but
of
a
pleasant
character
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
Eccles
,
as
he
be
name
,
be
one
of
those
individual
who
act
greatly
from
impulse
.
<EOS>
He
be
certainly
not
a
coward
,
and
,
perhaps
,
really
as
free
from
superstition
as
most
person
,
but
he
be
human
,
and
consequently
he
have
nerve
,
and
he
have
likewise
an
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
to
his
house
first
before
he
start
on
his
errand
to
the
ruin
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
get
a
horse
-
pistol
which
he
have
,
and
which
he
duly
load
and
place
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
then
he
wrap
himself
up
in
a
great
-
coat
,
and
with
the
air
of
a
man
quite
determined
upon
something
desperate
he
leave
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
the
guest
at
the
inn
look
after
him
as
he
walk
from
the
door
of
that
friendly
establishment
,
and
some
of
them
,
as
they
see
his
resolve
aspect
,
begin
to
quake
for
the
amount
of
the
wager
they
have
lay
upon
his
non
-
success
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
resolve
among
them
,
that
they
would
stay
until
half
-
past
twelve
,
in
the
expectation
of
his
return
,
before
they
separate
.
 
<EOS>
to
while
away
the
time
,
he
who
have
be
so
facetious
about
his
story
of
the
clock
-
weight
,
volunteer
to
tell
what
happen
to
a
friend
of
his
who
go
to
take
possession
of
some
family
property
which
he
become
possessed
of
as
heir
-
at
-
law
to
an
uncle
who
have
die
without
a
will
,
have
an
illegitimate
family
unprovide
for
in
every
shape
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
nobody
care
for
other
people
's
illegitimate
child
,
and
,
if
their
parent
do
not
provide
for
them
,
why
,
the
workhouse
be
open
for
them
,
just
as
if
they
be
something
different
from
other
people
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
they
be
;
if
their
parent
do
not
take
care
of
them
,
and
provide
for
them
,
nobody
else
will
,
as
you
say
,
neighbour
,
except
when
they
have
a
Fitz
put
to
their
name
,
which
tell
you
they
be
royal
bastard
,
and
of
course
unlike
anybody
else
's
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
go
on
--
let
's
know
all
about
it
;
we
sha'n't
hear
what
he
have
get
to
say
at
all
,
at
this
rate
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
as
I
be
say
,
or
about
to
say
,
the
nephew
,
as
soon
as
he
hear
his
uncle
be
dead
,
come
and
clap
his
seal
upon
everything
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
could
he
do
so
?
<EOS>
"
inquire
one
of
the
guest
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
what
be
to
hinder
him
,
"
reply
a
third
.
"
<EOS>
He
could
do
so
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
there
be
a
son
,
and
,
as
I
take
it
,
a
son
's
near
than
a
nephew
any
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
the
son
be
illegitimate
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
legitimate
,
or
illegitimate
,
a
son
be
a
son
;
do
not
bother
me
about
distinction
of
that
sort
;
why
,
now
,
there
be
old
Weatherbit--
"
 
"
order
,
order
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
let
's
hear
the
tale
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
good
,
gentleman
,
I
will
go
on
,
if
I
be
not
to
be
interrupt
;
but
I
will
say
this
,
that
an
illegitimate
son
be
no
son
,
in
the
eye
of
the
law
;
or
at
most
he
be
an
accident
quite
,
and
be
not
what
he
be
,
and
so
can
not
inherit
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
that
be
what
I
call
make
matter
plain
,
"
say
one
of
the
guest
,
who
take
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
to
make
room
for
the
remark
;
"
now
that
be
what
I
like
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
as
I
have
prove
then
,
"
resume
the
speaker
,
"
the
nephew
be
the
heir
,
and
into
the
house
he
would
come
.
<EOS>
a
fine
affair
<EOS>
it
be
too
--
<EOS>
the
illegitimate
look
the
colour
of
sloe
;
but
he
know
the
law
,
and
would
have
it
put
in
force
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Law
's
law
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
uncommonly
true
that
;
and
the
nephew
stick
to
it
like
a
cobbler
to
his
last
--
he
say
they
should
go
out
,
and
they
do
go
out
;
and
,
say
what
they
would
about
their
natural
claim
,
he
would
not
listen
to
them
,
but
bundle
them
out
and
out
in
a
pretty
short
space
of
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
try
to
them
,
mind
you
,
to
leave
the
house
they
have
be
bear
in
with
very
different
expectation
to
those
which
now
appear
to
be
their
fate
.
<EOS>
poor
thing
,
they
look
ruefully
enough
,
and
well
they
may
,
for
there
be
a
wide
world
for
them
,
and
no
prospect
of
a
warm
corner
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
as
I
be
say
,
he
have
them
all
out
and
the
house
clear
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
now
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
have
an
open
field
and
no
favour
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
for
no
--
eh
!
<EOS>
what
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
sudden
knocking
,
he
think
,
the
door
,
and
go
and
open
it
,
but
nothing
be
to
be
see
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
<EOS>
I
see
--
<EOS>
somebody
next
door
;

if
it
be
not
,
it
do
not
matter
.
<EOS>
there
be
nobody
here
.
<EOS>
I
be
alone
,
and
there
be
plenty
of
valuable
in
the
house

<EOS>
that
be
what
I
call
very
good
company
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
wish
for
well
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
turn
about
,
look
over
room
after
room
,
and
satisfy
himself
that
he
be
alone
--
that
the
house
be
empty
.
 
<EOS>
at
every
room
he
enter
he
pause
to
think
over
the
value
--
what
it
be
worth
,
and
that
he
be
a
very
fortunate
man
in
have
drop
into
such
a
good
thing
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
there
be
the
old
boy
's
secretary
,
too
--
his
bureau
<EOS>
--
there'll
be
something
in
that
that
will
amuse
me
mightily
;
but
I
do
not
think
I
shall
sit
up
late
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
rum
old
man
,
to
say
the
least
of
it
--
a
very
odd
sort
of
man
.
"
 
<EOS>
with
that
he
give
himself
a
shrug
,
as
if
some
very
uncomfortable
feeling
have
come
over
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
to
bed
early
,
and
get
some
sleep
,
and
then
in
daylight
I
can
look
after
these
paper
.
<EOS>
They
will
not
be
less
interesting
in
the
morning
than
they
be
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
there
have
be
some
rum
story
about
the
old
man
,
and
now
the
nephew
seem
to
think
he
may
have
let
the
family
sleep
on
the
premise
for
that
night
;
yes
,
at
that
moment
he
could
have
find
it
in
his
heart
to
have
pay
for
all
the
expense
of
their
keep
,
have
it
be
possible
to
have
have
them
back
to
remain
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
be
not
possible
,
for
they
would
not
have
do
it
,
but
sooner
have
remain
in
the
street
all
night
than
stay
there
all
night
,
like
so
many
house
-
dog
,
employ
by
one
who
step
in
between
them
and
their
father
's
good
,
which
be
their
inheritance
,
but
for
one
trifle
circumstance
--
a
mere
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
the
night
come
on
,
and
he
have
light
.
<EOS>
true
it
be
he
have
not
be
down
stair
,
only
just
to
have
a
look
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
tell
what
sort

a
place

be
;
there
be
a
good
many
odd
sort
of
passage
,
that
seem
to
end
nowhere
,
and
other
that
do
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
large
door
;
but
they
be
all
lock

and
he
have
the
key
;
so
he
do
not
mind
,

secure
all
place
that

not

<EOS>
He
then
go
up
stair
again
,
and
sit
down
in
the
room

the

<EOS>
"

They
may
not

strong
enough
to
prevent
the

propose

they
give

You

at

"

"
well

,
he
be
fidgetty

yet
he
be
not
a
man
to
be
very
easily
frightened

overcome

for
he
be
stout
and
bold

<EOS>
"
when
he
shut
himself
up
in
the
room
,
he
take
out
a
bottle
of
some
good
wine
,
and
help
himself
to
drink
;
it
be
good
old
wine
,
and
he
soon
feel
himself
warm
and
,
comfort
.
<EOS>
He
could
have
face
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
"
if

produce
such
an

he
mutter
,
"
what
will
two
do
?
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
question
that
could
only
be
solve
by
try
it
,
and
this
he
proceed
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
but
first
he
draw
a
brace
of
long
barrel
pistol
from
his
coat
pocket
,
and
take
a
powder
-
flask
and
bullet
from
his
pocket
also
,
he
load
them
very
carefully
.
 
<EOS>
"
there

he
,
"
be
my
bull

dog
;

rare
watch

dog
they
be

They
never
bark

they
bite

<EOS>
now
,
if
anybody
do
come
,
it
will
be
all
up
with
them
.
<EOS>
trick
upon
traveller
be
not
a
safe
game
when
I
have
these
;
and
now
for
the
other
bottle
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
draw
the
other
bottle
,
and
think
,
if
anything
,
it
be
well
than
the
first
.
<EOS>
He
drink
it
rather
quick
,
to
be
sure
,
and
then
he
begin
to
feel
sleepy
and
tired
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
shall
go
to
bed
,
"
he
say
;
"
that
is
,
if
I
can
find
my
way
there
,
for
it
do
seem
to
me
as
if
the
door
be
travel
.
<EOS>
never
mind
,
it
will
make
a
call
here
again
presently
,
and
then
I
will
get
through
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
he
arise
.
<EOS>
take
the
candle
in
his
hand
,
he
walk
with
a
well
step
than
may
have
be
expect
under
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
true
it
be
the
candle
wag
to
and
fro
,
and
his
shadow
dance
upon
the
wall
;
but
still
,
when
he
get
to
the
bed
,
he
secure
his
door
,
put
the
light
in
a
safe
place
,
throw
himself
down
,
and
be
fast
asleep
in
a
few
moment
,
or
rather
he
fall
into
a
doze
instantaneously
.
 
<EOS>
how
long
he
remain
in
this
state
he
know
not
,
but
he
be
suddenly
awaken
by
a
loud
bang
,
as
though
something
heavy
and
flat
have
fall
upon
the
floor
--
such
,
for
instance
,
as
a
door
,
or
anything
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
He
jump
up
,
rub
his
eye
,
and
could
even
then
hear
the
reverberation
through
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
?
"
<EOS>
he
mutter
;
"
what
be
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
listen
,
and
think
he
could
hear
something
move
down
stair
,
and
for
a
moment
he
be
seize
with
an
ague
fit
;
but
recollect
,
I
suppose
,
that
there
be
some
valuable
down
stair
that
be
worth
fight
for
,
he
carefully
extinguish
the
light
that
still
burn
,
and
softly
creep
down
stair
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
get
down
stair
he
think
he
could
hear
some
one
scramble
up
the
kitchen
stair
,
and
then
into
the
room
where
the
bureau
be
.
<EOS>
listen
for
a
moment
to
ascertain
if
there
be
more
than
one
,
and
then
feel
convinced
there
be
not
,
he
follow
into
the
parlour
,
when
he
hear
the
cabinet
open
by
a
key
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
new
miracle
,
and
one
he
could
not
understand
;
and
then
he
hear
the
paper
begin
to
rattle
and
rustle
;
so
,
draw
out
one
of
the
pistol
,
he
cock
it
,
and
walk
in
.
 
<EOS>
the
figure
instantly
begin
to
jump
about
;
it
be
dress
in
white
--
in
grave
-
clothe
.
<EOS>
He
be
terribly
nervous
,
and
shake
,
so
he
fear
to
fire
the
pistol
;
but
at
length
he
do
,
and
the
report
be
follow
by
a
fall
and
a
loud
groan
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
very
dreadful
--
very
dreadful
;
but
all
be
quiet
,
and
he
light
the
candle
again
,
and
approach
the
body
to
examine
it
,
and
ascertain
if
he
know
who
it
be
.
<EOS>
a
groan
come
from
it
.
<EOS>
the
bureau
be
open
,
and
the
figure
clutch
firmly
a
will
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
the
figure
be
dress
in
grave
-
clothe
,
and
he
start
up
when
he
see
the
form
and
feature
of
his
own
uncle
,
the
man
who
be
dead
,
who
somehow
or
other
have
escape
his
confinement
,
and
find
his
way
up
,
here
.
<EOS>
He
hold
his
will
firmly
;
and
the
nephew
be
so
horrified
and
stunned
,
that
he
throw
down
the
light
,
and
rush
out
of
the
room
with
a
shout
of
terror
,
and
never
return
again

conclude

one
of
the

said,--
 
"

do
you
really

they

[

]
 
part
of
the
distance
be
accomplish
towards
the
old
ruin
,
Tom
Eccles
begin
to
feel
that
what
he
have
undertake
be
not
altogether
such
child'
-
play
as
he
have
at
first
imagine
it
to
be
.
<EOS>
somehow
or
another
,
with
a
singular
and
uncomfortable
sort
of
distinctness
,
there
come
across
his
mind
every
story
that
he
have
remember
of
the
wild
and
the
wonderful
.
<EOS>
all
the
long
-
since
forget
tale
of
superstition
that
in
early
childhood
he
have
learn
,
come
now
back
upon
him
,
suggest
to
his
mind
a
thousand
uncomfortable
fancy
of
the
strange
description
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
likely
that
when
once
a
man
,
under
such
circumstance
,
get
into
such
a
frame
of
mind
,
he
would
readily
get
out
of
it
again
,
while
he
continue
surround
by
such
scene
as
have
first
call
them
into
existence
.
 
<EOS>
no
doubt
,
have
he
turn
about
,
and
face
the
inn
again
instead
of
the
old
ruin
he
would
soon
have
shake
off
these
"
thick
coming
fancy
;
"
but
such
a
result
be
no
to
be
expect
,
so
long
as
he
keep
on
towards
the
dismal
place
he
have
pledge
himself
to
reach
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
traverse
meadow
after
meadow
he
begin
to
ask
himself
some
question
which
he
find
that
he
could
not
answer
exactly
in
a
consolatory
manner
,
under
the
present
state
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
among
these
question
be
the
very
pertinent
one
<EOS>
of,--"it
be
no
argument
against
vampyre
,
because
I
do
not
see
the
use
of
'
em
--
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
this
he
be
compel
to
answer
as
he
have
put
it
;
and
when
,
in
addition
,
he
begin
to
recollect
that
,
without
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
,
Sir
Francis
Varney
the
suppose
vampyre
,
have
be
chase
across
the
field
to
that
very
ruin
whither
he
be
bind
,
and
have
then
and
there
disappear
,
he
certainly
find
himself
in
decidedly
uncomfortable
and
most
unpromising
situation
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
he
say
,
"
no
.
<EOS>
hang
it
,
I
will
not
go
back
now
,
to
be
make
the
laughing
-
stock
of
the
whole
town
,
which
I
should
be
.
<EOS>
come
what
may
of
it
,
I
will
go
on
as
I
have
commence
;
so
I
shall
put
on
as
stout
a
heart
as
I
can
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
,
have
come
to
this
resolve
,
he
strive
might
and
main
to
banish
from
his
mind
those
disagreeable
reminiscence
that
have
be
oppress
him
,
to
turn
his
attention
to
subject
of
a
different
complexion
.
 
<EOS>
during
the
progress
of
make
this
endeavour
,
which
be
rather
futile
,
he
come
within
sight
of
the
ruin
.
<EOS>
then
he
slacken
his
pace
a
little
,
tell
himself
,
with
a
pardonable
self
-
deceit
,
that
it
be
common
,
ordinary
caution
only
,
which
induce
him
to
do
so
,
and
nothing
at
all
in
the
shape
of
fear
.
 
<EOS>
"
Time
enough
,
"
he
remark
,
"
to
be
afraid
,
when
I
see
anything
to
be
afraid
of
,
which
I
do
not
see
as
yet
.
<EOS>
so
,
as
all
be
right
,
I
may
as
well
put
a
good
face
upon
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
try
to
whistle
a
tune
,
but
it
turn
out
only
a
melancholy
failure
;
so
he
give
that
up
in
despair
,
and
walk
on
until
he
get
within
a
hundred
yard
,
or
thereabout
,
of
the
old
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
He
thus
proceed
,
and
bend
his
ear
close
to
the
ground
,
he
listen
attentively
for
several
minute
.
<EOS>
somehow
,
he
fancy
that
a
strange
,
murmur
sound
come
to
his
ear
;
but
he
be
not
quite
sure
that
it
proceed
from
the
ruin
,
because
it
be
just
that
sort
of
sound
that
may
come
from
a
long
way
off
,
be
mellow
by
distance
,
although
,
perhaps
,
loud
enough
at
its
source
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
"
he
whisper
to
himself
,
"
it
do
not
matter
much
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
go
I
must
,
and
hide
the
handkerchief
somewhere
,
or
else
be
laugh
at
,
besides
lose
my
wage
.
<EOS>
the
former
I
do
not
like
,
and
the
latter
I
can
not
afford
.
"
 
<EOS>
thus
clinch
the
matter
by
such
knock
-
down
argument
,
he
walk
on
until
he
be
almost
within
the
very
shadow
of
the
ruin
,
and
,
probably
,
it
be
at
this
juncture
that
his
footstep
may
have
be
hear
by
Marchdale
and
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
pause
again
;
but
all
be
profoundly
still
,
and
he
begin
to
think
that
the
strange
sort
of
murmur
noise
which
he
have
hear
must
have
come
from
far
off
and
not
at
all
from
any
person
or
person
within
the
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
me
see
,
"
he
say
to
himself
;
"
I
have
five
handkerchief
to
hide
among
the
old
ruin
somewhere
,
and
the
sooner
I
do
<EOS>
so
the
well
,
because
then
I
will
get
away
;
for
,
as
regard
stay
here
to
watch
,
Heaven
know
how
long
,
for
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
I
do
not
intend
to
do
it
,
upon
second
thought
and
second
thought
,
they
say
,
be
generally
good
.
"
 
<EOS>
with
the
most
careful
footstep
now
,
as
if
he
be
tread
upon
some
fragile
substance
,
which
he
fear
to
injure
,
he
advance
until
he
be
fairly
within
the
precinct
of
the
ancient
place
,
which
now
bear
so
ill
a
reputation
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
make
to
himself
much
the
same
remark
that
Sir
Francis
Varney
have
make
to
Marchdale
,
with
respect
to
the
brightening
up
of
the
sky
,
in
consequence
of
its
being
near
the
time
for
the
moon
to
rise
from
the
horizon
,
and
he
see
more
clearly
around
him
,
although
he
could
not
find
any
good
place
to
hide
the
handkerchiefs
in
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
and
will
,
"
he
say
,
"
hide
them
securely
;
for
it
would
,
indeed
,
be
remarkably
unpleasant
,
after
come
here
and
win
my
wage
,
to
have
the
proof
that
I
have
do
so
take
away
by
some
chance
visitor
to
the
place
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
at
length
see
a
tolerably
large
stone
,
which
stand
,
in
a
slant
position
,
up
against
one
of
the
wall
.
<EOS>
Its
size
attract
him
.
<EOS>
He
think
,
if
his
strength
be
sufficient
to
move
it
,
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
do
so
,
and
to
place
the
handkerchief
beneath
it
;
for
,
at
all
event
,
it
be
so
heavy
that
it
could
not
be
kick
aside
,
and
no
one
,
without
some
sort
of
motive
to
do
so
,
beyond
the
mere
love
of
labour
,
would
set
about
move
it
from
its
position
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
may
go
further
and
fare
worse
,
"
he
say
to
himself
;
"
so
here
shall
all
the
handkerchiefs
lie
,
to
afford
a
proof
that
I
have
be
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
pack
them
into
a
small
compass
,
and
then
stoop
to
roll
aside
the
heavy
stone
,
when
,
at
the
moment
,
before
he
could
apply
his
strength
to
that
purpose
,
he
hear
some
one
,
in
his
immediate
neighbourhood
,
say,--"hist
!
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
so
sudden
,
and
so
utterly
unexpected
,
that
he
not
only
cease
his
exertion
to
move
the
stone
,
but
he
nearly
fall
down
in
his
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hist
--
hist
!
"
say
the
voice
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
--
what
,
"
gasp
Tom
Eccles--"what
be
you?"--"Hush
--
hush
--
hush
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
perspiration
break
out
upon
his
brow
,
and
he
lean
against
the
wall
for
support
,
as
he
manage
to
say
,
faintly,--
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
hush
--
<EOS>
what
then?"--"hist
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well

"--"I'm

<EOS>
there
be
a
slow
and
cautious
footstep
,

Marchdale
advance
to
where
Tom
Eccles
be
stand
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
,
now
,
"
say
the
latter
,
when
he
see
the
dusky
-
look
form
stalk
towards
him
;
"
till
I
know

better

will
be
oblige

off

your
distance

Armed

exclaim
Marchdale
,
and
he
at
once
<EOS>
paused.--"Yes
,
I
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
be
a
friend
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
sort
of
objection
frankly
to
tell
you
my
errand
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
friend
of
the
Bannerworth
family
,
and
have
keep
watch
here
now
for
two
night
,
in
the
hope
of
meet
with
Varney
,
the
vampyre
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
deuce
you
have
:
and
pray
what
may
your
name
be?"--"Marchdale
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
be
Mr.
Marchdale
,
I
know
you
by
sight
:
for
I
have
see
you
with
Mr.
Henry
Bannerworth
several
time
.
<EOS>
come
out
from
among
the
shadow
,
and
let
us
have
a
look
at
you
;
but
,
till
you
do
,
do
not
come
within
arm
's
length
of
me

<EOS>
I
be
not
naturally
suspicious

we
can
not

careful

oh
!
certainly

certainly

<EOS>
the
silver
edge
of
the
moon
be
now
just
peep
up
from
the
east
,
and
you
will
be
able
to
see
me
well
,
if
you
step
from
the
shadow
of
the
wall
by
which
you
now
be

"
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
reasonable
enough
proposition
,
and
Tom
Eccles
at
once
accede
to
it
,
by
step
out
boldly
into
the
partial
moonlight
,
which
now
begin
to
fall
upon
the
open
meadow
,
tint
the
grass
with
a
silvery
refulgence
,
and
render
even
minute
object
visible
.
<EOS>
the
moment
he
see
Marchdale
he
know
him
,
and
,
advance
frankly
to
him

,
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
you

well

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
what
bring
you
here?"--"a
wager
for
one
thing
,

a
wish
to
see
the
vampyre
for
another
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed!"--"Yes
;
I
must
own
<EOS>
I
have
such
a
wish

along
with
a
still
strong
one

to
capture
him
,
if
possible

as
there
be
now
two
of

why
may
we
not

it

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
as
for
capture

Marchdale

I

I
would

indeed

I
have
see
him
once

down

I
have
no

as
well

what
be
you
do
with

huge

I
see
you
bend
over?"--"i

Will
you
walk

It

odd
enough

Marchdale
,
after
he
have
show
Tom
Eccles
where
to
hide
the
handkerchiefs
,

that
you
and
I
should
both
be
here

similar
an
errand

glad

ten

more
endurable

it
otherwise
would
be

what
do
you
propose
to
do
if
you
see
the
vampyre
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
try
a
pistol
bullet
on
him

<EOS>
You
say
you
be
armed?"--"yes

<EOS>
"
with

load
well

,
<EOS>
yes

I
can
depend

I

anything
there

come
farther
back

look

at
the
corner
of
that
wall
there
I
be
certain
there
be
the
flutter
of
a
human
garment

"--"There

ram
down

it

that
be
Varney

fire

Marchdale

at
the
instant
Sir
Francis

spring
forward
,

make
off
at
a
rapid
pace
across
the
meadow

fire

will
be
off

<EOS>
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
,
and
thus
urge
by
the
voice
and
the
gesture
of
his
companion
,
Tom
Eccles
take
aim
as
well
as
he
could
,
and
fire
after
the
retreat
form
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
<EOS>
His
conscience
smote
him
as
he
hear
the
report
and
see
the
flash
of
the
large
pistol
amid
the
half
sort
of
darkness
that
be
still
around
.
 
<EOS>
the
effect
of
the
shot
be
then
to
him
painfully
apparent
.
<EOS>
He
see
Varney
stop
instantly
;
then
make
a
vain
attempt
to
stagger
forward
a
little
,
and
finally
fall
heavily
to
the
earth
,
with
all
the
appearance
of
one
kill
upon
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
hit
him

say
Marchdale--"you
have
hit
him

bravo!"--"i
have

hit
him

shot

by
Jove!"--"I
be

"
sorry

<EOS>
sorry
for
rid
the

couple
of
slug

"
well

they
have
make
a
lodgment

him

I
beg
your
pardon
there

when

up

you

Mr.

to
do
so

now
,
I
shall
stay

see
if
the
effect

you
talk

will
ensue
;

it
may
convince
me
that
he
be
a
vampyre

that
there
be

he
may
go
off

free

go
off?"--"Yes

You

in

manner

mark

me
:
<EOS>
I
will
not

him
touch
any
more
to
-
night

think
there
be
a
chance

make
a
prisoner
of
him
without
violence

"
 
<EOS>
"
there
he
lie
;
you
can
go
and
make
a
prisoner
of
him
at
once

dead
as
he
be
;
and
if
you
take
him
out
of
the
moonlight--
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
understand
;
he
will
not
recover
.
"--"certainly
<EOS>
not

,
as
I
want
him
to
recover

"--"Well

I
can
not

honour
your
scruple

I
do
not
actually
share
in
them

I
promise
you
that
,
since
such
be
your
wish
,
I
will
take
no
step
against
the
vampyre
;
but
let
us
come
up
to
him
and
see
if
he
be
really
dead
,

only
badly
wounded

<EOS>
Tom
Eccles
hang
back
a
little
from
this
proposal
;
but
,
upon
be
urge
again
by
Marchdale
,
and
tell
that
he
nee
not
go
closer
than
he
choose
,
he
consent
,
and
the
two
of
them
approach
the
prostrate
form
of
Sir
Francis
Varney

which
lie
upon
its
face
in
the
faint
moonlight

He

Will

They
halt
within

of
yard
of
the
body

<EOS>
Tom
Eccles
would
not
go
a
step
farther
;
so
Marchdale
advance
alone
,

pretend
to
be
,
with
great
repugnance

examine
for
the
wound

He
be

dead

I
can
not

"--"I

turn
his

us
see

<EOS>
Marchdale
lift
up
the
head

disclose
such
a
mass
of
clot

look
blood

that
Tom
Eccles
at
once
take
to
his
heel

nor
stop
until
he
be
nearly
as
far
off
as
the
ruin

<EOS>
marchdale
follow
him
more
slowly
,

when
he
come
up
to
him

he
said,--

"
Psha
!

You
look
upon
this
matter

seriously

think
of
who

you
will
soon
acquit

now

full
upon
him

and
each
moment
increase
in
intensity

you
he
will
recover
?
"
 
<EOS>

I
do
indeed

"--"Then
<EOS>
here
will
I
wait
.

"
 
<EOS>
"
since
that
be
you
resolve
,
I
will
keep
you
company
.
<EOS>
We
shall
easily
find
some
old
stone
in
the
ruin
which
will
serve
us
for
a
seat
,
and
there
at
leisure
we
can
keep
our
eye
upon
the
dead
body
,
and
be
able
to
observe
if
it
make
the
least
movement
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
plan
be
adopt
,
and
they
sit
down
just
within
the
ruin
,
but
in
such
a
place
that
they
have
a
full
view
of
the
dead
body
,
as
it
appear
to
be
,
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
upon
which
the
sweet
moonbeams
shine
full
and
clear
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
Eccles
relate
how
he
be
incite
to
come
upon
his
expedition
,
but
he
may
have
spare
himself
that
trouble
,
as
Marchdale
have
be
in
a
retire
corner
of
the
inn
parlour
before
he
come
to
his
appointment
with
Varney
,
and
hear
the
business
for
the
most
part
propose
.
 
<EOS>
half
-
an
-
hour
,
certainly
not
more
,
may
have
elapse
;
when
suddenly
Tom
Eccles
utter
an
exclamation
,
partly
of
surprise
and
partly
of
terror,--
 
<EOS>
"
He
move
;
he
move
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
.
<EOS>
"
look
at
the
vampyre
's
body
.
"
 
<EOS>
Marchdale
affect
to
look
with
an
all
-
absorb
interest
,
and
there
be
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
raise
slowly
one
arm
with
the
hand
outstretche
towards
the
moon
,
as
if
invoke
that
luminary
to
shed
more
of
its
beam
upon
him
.
<EOS>
then
the
body
move
slowly
,
like
some
one
writhing
in
pain
,
and
yet
unable
to
move
from
the
spot
on
which
it
lie
.
<EOS>
from
the
head
to
the
foot
,
the
whole
frame
seem
to
be
convulse
,
and
now
and
then
as
the
ghastly
object
seem
to
be
gather
more
strength
,
the
limb
be
throw
out
with
a
rapid
and
a
frightful
looking
violence
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
truly
to
one
,
who
may
look
upon
it
as
a
reality
and
no
juggle
,
a
frightful
sight
to
see
,
and
although
Marchdale
,
of
course
,
tolerably
well
preserve
his
equanimity
,
only
now
and
then
,
for
appearance
sake
,
affect
to
be
wonderfully
shocked
,
poor
Tom
Eccles
be
in
such
a
state
of
horror
and
fright
that
he
could
not
,
if
he
would
,
have
fly
from
the
spot
,
so
fascinated
be
he
by
the
horrible
spectacle
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
state
of
thing
which
continue
for
many
minute
,
and
then
the
body
show
evident
symptom
of
so
much
return
animation
,
that
it
be
about
to
rise
from
his
gory
bed
and
mingle
once
again
with
the
living
.
 
<EOS>
"
Behold
!
<EOS>
"
say
marchdale--"behold!"--"heaven
have
mercy
upon
us
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
as
I
say
;
the
beam
of
the
moon
have
revive
the
vampyre
.
<EOS>
You
perceive
now
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"--"Yes
,
yes
,
I
see
him
;
I
see
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
now
,
as
if
with
a
great
struggle
,
rise
to
his
foot
,
and
look
up
at
the
bright
moon
for
some
moment
with
such
an
air
and
manner
that
it
would
not
have
require
any
very
great
amount
of
imagination
to
conceive
that
he
be
return
to
it
some
sort
of
thanksgiving
for
the
good
that
it
have
do
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
seem
for
some
moment
in
a
state
of
considerable
indecision
as
to
which
way
he
should
proceed
.
<EOS>
He
turn
round
several
time
.
<EOS>
then
he
advance
a
step
or
two
towards
the
house
,
but
apparently
his
resolution
change
again
,
and
cast
his
eye
upon
the
ruin
,
he
at
once
make
towards
them
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
too
much
for
the
philosophy
as
well
as
for
the
courage
of
Tom
Eccles
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
very
well
to
look
on
at
some
distance
,
and
observe
the
wonderful
and
inexplicable
proceeding
of
the
vampyre
;
but
when
he
show
symptom
of
make
a
near
acquaintance
,
it
be
not
to
be
bear
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
he
be
come
here
,
"
say
Tom.--"He
seem
so
indeed
,
"
remark
Marchdale
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
mean
to
stay?"--"i
think
I
shall
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
,
do
you?"--"Yes
,
I
should
much
like
to
question
him
,
and
as
we
be
two
to
one
I
think
we
really
can
have
nothing
to
fear
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
?
<EOS>
I
be
altogether
of
a
different
opinion
.
<EOS>
a
man
who
have
more
life
than
a
cat
do
not
much
mind
at
what
odd
he
fight
.
<EOS>
You
may
stay
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
"--"You
do
not
mean
to
say
that
you
will
desert
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
a
bit
how
you
call
it
desert
you
;
if
we
have
come
out
together
on
this
adventure
,
I
would
have
stay
it
out
with
you
;
but
as
we
come
separate
and
independent
,
we
may
as
well
go
back
so
.
<EOS>
"--"Well
,
but--
"
 
"
good
morning
?
<EOS>
"
cry
Tom
,
and
he
at
once
take
to
his
heel
towards
the
town
,
without
stay
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
remonstrance
of
Marchdale
,
who
call
after
him
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
probably
,
have
Tom
Eccles
not
go
off
so
rapidly
,
would
have
yet
take
another
thought
,
and
go
in
another
direction
than
that
which
lead
him
to
the
ruin
,
and
<EOS>
Tom
,
if
he
have
have
his
sense
fully
about
him
,
as
well
as
all
his
power
of
perception
,
would
have
see
that
the
progress
of
the
vampyre
be
very
slow
,
while
he
continue
to
converse
with
Marchdale
,
and
that
it
be
only
when
he
go
off
at
good
speed
that
Sir
Francis
Varney
likewise
think
it
prudent
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
he
much
terrified
?
"
say
Varney
,
as
he
come
up
to
Marchdale.--"Yes
,
most
completely
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
this
then
,
will
make
a
good
story
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
"--"It
<EOS>
will
,
indeed
,
and
not
a
little
enhance
your
reputation

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
well
;
it
do
not
much
matter
now
;
but
if
by
terrify
people
I
can
purchase
for
myself
anything
like
immunity
for
the
past
,
I
shall
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
"--"I

much
precipitation

courage

unquestionably

"--"Or
<EOS>
else
he
would
have
shrink
from
come
here
at
all

"
 
<EOS>
"
true
,
but
his
courage
and
presence
arise
from
his
strong
doubt
as
to
the
existence
of
such
being
as
vampyre
.
<EOS>
"--"Yes
,

now
that

his

evaporate
along
with
his
doubt

such
a
tale
as
he
have
now
to
tell
,
will
be
find
sufficient
to
convert
even
the
most
sceptical
in
the
town
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
.
<EOS>
"--"And
<EOS>
yet
it
can
not
much
avail
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
personally
,
<EOS>
but
I
must
confess
that
I
be
not
dead
to
all
human
opinion
,
and
I
feel
some
desire
of
revenge
against
those
dastard
who
by
hundred
have
hunt
me
,
burn
down
my
mansion
,
and
seek
my
destruction
.
<EOS>
"--"That
<EOS>
I
do
not
wonder
at

"
 
<EOS>

I
would
fain
leave
among
them
a
legacy
of
fear
.
<EOS>
such
fear
as
shall
haunt
them
and
their
child
for
year
to
come
.
<EOS>
I
would
wish
that
the
name
of
Varney
,
the
vampire

should
be
a
sound
of
terror
for
generation

so

now

consideration

with
our
prisoner

what
be
your
resolve
upon
that
point
?
"
 
<EOS>

I
have
consider
it
while
I
be
lie
upon
yon
green
sward
wait
for
the
friendly
moonbeam
to
fall
upon
my
face
,
and
it
seem
to
me
that
there
be
no
sort
of
resource
but
to----"--"kill
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
.
<EOS>
"--"What
then
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
to
set
him
free
.
<EOS>
"--"Nay
,
have
you
consider
the
immense
hazard
of
do
so
?
<EOS>
think
again
;
I
pray
you
think
again
.
<EOS>
I
be
decidedly
of
opinion
that
he
more
than
suspect
who
be
his
enemy
;
and
,
in
that
case
,
you
know
what
consequence
would
ensue
;
besides
,
have
we
not
enough
already
to
encounter
?
<EOS>
why
should
we
add
another
young

bold
,
determine
spirit
to
the
band
which
be
already
array
against
us

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
talk
in

Marchdale
;
I
know
to
what
it
all
tend
;
you
have
a
strong
desire
for
the
death
of
this
young
man

<EOS>
"--"No
;
there
you
wrong
me

<EOS>
I
have
no
desire

his
death

where
great
interest

there
must
be

make

so
there
must

,
I
will
make
a
sacrifice

I
will
not
act
so
heedlessly
as
that
your
principle

caution
shall
blame
me

I
will
attempt
to
get
from
him
some
promise
that
he
will
not
make
himself
an
active
instrument
against
me

<EOS>
perchance
,
too
,
as
Bannerworth
Hall
,
which
he
be
sure
to
visit
,
wear
such
an
air
of
desertion
,
I
may
be
able
to
persuade
him
that
the
Bannerworth
family
,
as
well
as
his
uncle
,
have
leave
this
part
of
the
country
altogether
;
so
that
,
without
make
any
inquiry
for
them
about
the
neighbourhood
,
he
may
be
induce
to
leave
at
once
.
<EOS>
"--"That
would
be
well

good
;
your
prudence
approve
of
the
plan

shall
be
do

<EOS>
"--"I
be

Marchdale

with
a
slight
tone
of
sarcasm

calmly.--"will

night

well
,
then
,
two
hour
after
sunset
I
will
come
here
and
release
him
from
his
weary
bondage

now
I
must
go
to
find
some
place
in
which
to
hide
my
proscribed
head

as
for
Bannerworth
Hall

I

as
I
before
remark

we
must
disappear

for
a
time

so
as
to
lull
suspicion

there
will
then
arise
a
period
when
Bannerworth
Hall
will
neither
be
watch

as
it
be
now

nor
will
it
be
inhabited,--a
period
before
the
Bannerworth
family
have
make
up
its
mind
to
go
back
to
it
,
and
when
long
watch
without
a
result
have
become
too
tiresome

up

<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
and
Marchdale
walk
for
some
time
in
silence
across
the
meadow
.
<EOS>
It
be
evident
that
there
be
not
between
these
associate
the
very
good
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
marchdale
be
always
smart
under
an
assumption
of
authority
over
him
,
on
the
part
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
while
the
latter
scarcely
care
to
conceal
any
portion
of
the
contempt
with
which
he
regard
his
hypocritical
companion
.
 
<EOS>
some
very
strong
band
of
union
,
indeed
,
must
surely
bind
these
two
strange
person
together
!
<EOS>
It
must
be
something
of
a
more
than
common
nature
which
induce
Marchdale
not
only
to
obey
the
behest
of
his
mysterious
companion
,
but
to
supply
him
so
readily
with
money
as
we
perceive
he
promise
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
as
regard
Varney
,
the
vampyre
,
he
,
too
,
must
have
some
great
object
in
view
to
induce
him
to
run
such

world
of
risk

so
much
trouble
as

Bannerworth
family

what
his
object

be
the
object
of
Marchdale

<EOS>
will
,
now
that
we
have
progress
so
far
in
our
story
,
soon
appear

and
then
much
that
be
perfectly
inexplicable
,
will
become
clear
and
distinct

find

strong

CHAPTER
LXV
.
 
<EOS>
VARNEY
's
visit
to
the
dungeon
of
the
lonely
PRISONER
in
the
ruin
.
  
<EOS>
[
illustration
]
 
<EOS>
Evident
<EOS>
it
be
that
Marchdale
be
not
near
so
scrupulous
as
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
in
what
he
choose
to
do
.
<EOS>
He
would
,
without
hesitation
,
have
sacrifice
the
life
of
that
prisoner
in
the
lonely
dungeon
,
whom
it
would
be
an
insult
to
the
understanding
of
our
reader
,
not
to
presume
that
they
have
,
long
ere
this
,
establish
in
their
mind
to
be
Charles
Holland
.
 
<EOS>
His
own
safety
seem
to
be
the
paramount
consideration
with
Marchdale
,
and
it
be
evident
that
he
care
for
nothing
in
comparison
with
that
object
.
 
<EOS>
It
say
much
,
however
,
for
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
that
he
do
not
give
in
to
such
a
blood
-
thirsty
feeling
,
but
rather
choose
to
set
the
prisoner
free
,
and
run
all
the
chance
of
the
danger
to
which
he
may
expose
himself
by
such
a
course
of
conduct
,
than
to
insure
safety
,
comparatively
,
by
his
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
be
evidently
a
character
of
strangely
mixed
feeling
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
evident
that
he
have
some
great
object
in
view
,
which
he
wish
to
accomplish
almost
at
any
risk
;
but
it
be
equally
evident
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
he
wish
to
do
so
with
the
least
possible
injury
to
other
,
or
else
he
would
never
have
behave
as
he
have
do
in
his
interview
with
the
beautiful
and
persecute
Flora
Bannerworth
,
or
now
suggest
the
idea
of
set
Charles
Holland
free
from
the
dreary
dungeon
in
which
he
have
be
so
long
confine
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
always
anxious
and
willing
to
give
every
one
credit
for
the
good
that
be
in
them
;
and
,
hence
,
we
be
pleased
to
find
that
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
despite
his
singular
,
and
apparently
preternatural
capability
,
have
something
sufficiently
human
about
his
mind
and
feeling
,
to
induce
him
to
do
as
little
injury
as
possible
to
other
in
the
pursuit
of
his
own
object
.
 
<EOS>
of
the
two
,
vampyre
as
he
be
,
we
prefer
him
much
to
the
despicable
and
hypocritical
,
Marchdale
,
who
,
under
the
pretence
of
be
the
friend
of
the
Bannerworth
family
,
would
freely
have
inflict
upon
them
the
most
deadly
injury
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
quite
clear
that
he
be
most
dreadfully
disappoint
that
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
would
not
permit
him
to
take
the
life
of
Charles
Holland
,
and
it
be
with
a
gloomy
and
dissatisfied
air
that
he
leave
the
ruin
to
proceed
towards
the
town
,
after
what
we
may
almost
term
the
altercation
he
have
have
with
Varney
the
vampyre
upon
that
subject
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
suppose
that
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
however
,
be
blind
to
the
danger
which
must
inevitably
accrue
from
permit
Charles
Holland
once
more
to
obtain
his
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
what
the
latter
would
be
able
to
state
would
be
more
than
sufficient
to
convince
the
Bannerworths
,
and
all
interested
in
their
fortune
,
that
something
be
go
on
of
a
character
,
which
,
however
,
supernatural
it
may
seem
to
be
,
still
seem
to
have
some
human
and
ordinary
object
for
its
end
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
think
over
all
this
before
he
proceed
,
accord
to
his
promise
,
to
the
dungeon
of
the
prisoner
;
but
it
would
seem
as
if
there
be
considerable
difficulty
,
even
to
an
individual
of
his
long
practice
in
all
kind
of
chicanery
and
deceit
,
in
arrive
at
any
satisfactory
conclusion
,
as
to
a
means
of
make
Charles
Holland
's
release
a
matter
of
less
danger
to
himself
,
than
it
would
be
likely
to
be
,
if
,
unfettere
by
obligation
,
he
be
at
once
set
free
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
solemn
hour
of
midnight
,
while
all
be
still
,
that
is
,
to
say
,
on
the
night
succeed
the
one
,
on
which
he
have
have
the
interview
with
Marchdale
,
we
have
record
,
Sir
Francis
Varney
alone
seek
the
silent
ruin
.
<EOS>
He
be
attire
,
as
usual
,
in
his
huge
cloak
,
and
,
indeed
,
the
chilly
air
of
the
evening
warrant
such
protection
against
its
numerous
discomfort
.
 
<EOS>
have
any
one
see
him
,
however
,
that
evening
,
they
would
have
observe
an
air
of
great
doubt
,
and
irresolution
upon
his
brow
,
as
if
he
be
struggle
with
some
impulse
which
he
find
it
extremely
difficult
to
restrain
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
<EOS>
well
,
"
he
mutter
,
as
he
walk
among
the
shadow
of
the
ruin
,
"
that
Marchdale
's
reasoning
be
coldly
and
horribly
correct
,
when
he
say
that
there
be
danger
in
set
this
youth
free
;
but
,
I
be
about
to
leave
this
place
,
and
not
to
show
myself
for
some
time
,
and
I
can
not
reconcile
myself
to
inflict
upon
him
the
horror
of
a
death
by
starvation
,
which
must
ensue
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
night
of
more
than
usual
dullness
,
and
,
as
Sir
Francis
Varney
remove
the
massy
stone
,
which
hide
the
narrow
and
tortuous
entrance
to
the
dungeon
,
a
chilly
feeling
creep
over
him
,
and
he
could
not
help
supposing
,
that
even
then
Marchdale
may
have
play
him
false
,
and
neglect
to
supply
the
prisoner
food
,
accord
to
his
promise
.
 
<EOS>
hastily
he
descend
to
the
dungeon
,
and
with
a
step
,
which
have
in
it
far
less
of
caution
,
than
have
usually
characterise
his
proceeding
,
he
proceed
onwards
until
he
reach
that
particular
dungeon
,
in
which
our
young
friend
,
to
whom
we
wish
so
well
,
have
be
so
long
confine
from
the
beautiful
and
cheering
light
of
day
,
and
from
all
that
his
heart
's
good
affection
most
cling
to
.
 
<EOS>
"
speak
,
"
say
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
as
he
enter
the
dungeon--"If
<EOS>
the
occupant
of
this
dreary
place
live
,
let
him
answer
one
who
be
as
much
his
friend
as
he
have
be
his
enemy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
friend
,
"
say
Charles
Holland
,
faintly
;
"
unless
it
be
one
who
would
come
and
restore
me
to
liberty
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
how
know
you
that
I
be
not
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
voice
sound
like
that
of
one
of
my
persecutor
.
<EOS>
why
do
you
not
place
the
climax
to
your
injury
by
at
once
take
away
life
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
better
pleased
that
you
would
do
so
,
than
that
I
should
wear
out
the
useless
struggle
of
existence
in
so
dreary
and
wretche
an
abode
as
this
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
young
man
,
"
say
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
"
I
have
come
to
you
on
a
great
errand
of
mercy
<EOS>
than
,
probably
,
you
will
ever
give
me
credit
for
.
<EOS>
there
be
one
who
would
too
readily
have
grant
your
present
request
,
and
who
would
at
once
have
take
that
life
of
which
you
profess
to
be
so
wearied
;
but
which
may
yet
present
to
you
some
of
its
sunny
and
most
beautiful
aspect
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
tone
be
friendly
,
"
say
Charles
;
"
but
yet
I
dread
some
new
deception
.
<EOS>
that
you
be
one
of
those
who
consign
me
by
stratagem
,
and
by
brute
force
,
to
this
place
of
durance
,
I
be
perfectly
well
assure
,
and
,
therefore
,
any
good
that
may
be
promise
by
you
,
present
itself
to
me
in
a
very
doubtful
character
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
be
surprised
,
"
say
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
"
at
such
sentiment
arise
from
your
lip
;
but
,
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
I
be
inclined
to
save
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
be
detain
here
because
it
be
suppose
by
be
so
,
a
particular
object
would
be
best
obtain
by
your
absence
.
<EOS>
that
object
,
however
have
fail
,
notwithstanding
,
and
I
do
not
feel
further
inclined
to
protract
your
suffering
.
<EOS>
have
you
any
guess
as
to
the
party
who
have
thus
confine
you?"--"I
be
unaccustomed
to
dissemble
,
and
,
therefore
I
will
say
at
once
that
I
have
a
guess

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
in
which
way
do
it
tend?"--
 
"
against
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
call
the
vampyre

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
it
not
strike
you
that
this
may
be
a
dangerous
candour?"--"It
may
,

it
may
not

I
can
not
help
it

<EOS>
I
know
I
be
at
the
mercy

my
foe

I
do

anything
I

make
my

worse

well

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
much
mistaken
there
.
<EOS>
in
other
hand
than
mine

it
may
make
it
much
bad
;
but
it
happen
to
be
one
of
my
weakness

that
I
be

with
candour

I
admire
boldness

disposition

"--"Indeed
!

can
behave
in

manner

have
do
towards
me

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
there
be
more
thing
in
heaven
and
on
earth
than
be
dreamt
of
in
your
philosophy
.
<EOS>
I
be
the
more
encouraged
to
set
you
free
,
because
,
if
I
procure
from
you
a
promise
,
which
I
intend

weary
enough

miserable
imprisonment

Will

me

I
wish

Nay

I

Charles

for

then
he
said,--

farewell

<EOS>
when
you
think
of

fancy

rather
one

tell
yourself

Varney

some
trait

[

for
a
brief
space
let
us
return
to
Flora
Bannerworth
,
who
have
suffer
so
much
on
account
of
her
affection
,
as
well
as
on
account
of
the
mysterious
attack
that
have
be
make
upon
her
by
the
repute
vampyre
.
 
<EOS>
after
leave
Bannerworth
Hall
for
a
short
time
,
she
seem
to
recover
her
spirit
;
but
this
be
a
state
of
thing
which
do
not
last
,
and
only
show
how
fallacious
it
be
to
expect
that
,
after
the
grievous
thing
that
have
happen
,
she
would
rapidly
recover
her
equanimity
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
say
,
by
learn
physiologist
,
that
two
bodily
pain
can
not
endure
at
the
same
space
of
time
in
the
system
;
and
,
whether
it
be
so
or
not
,
be
a
question
concern
which
it
would
be
foreign
to
the
nature
of
our
work
,
to
enter
into
anything
like
an
elaborate
disquisition
.
 
<EOS>
certainly
,
however
,
so
far
as
Flora
Bannerworth
be
concern
,
she
seem
inclined
to
show
that
,
mentally
,
the
observation
be
a
true
one
,
for
that
,
now
she
become
release
from
a
continued
dread
of
the
visit
of
the
vampyre
,
<EOS>
her
mind
would
,
with
more
painful
interest
than
ever
,
recur
to
the
melancholy
condition
,
probably
,
of
Charles
Holland
,
if
he
be
alive
,
and
to
soul
-
harrow
reflection
concern
him
,
if
he
be
dead
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
,
and
she
do
not
,
believe
,
for
one
moment
,
that
his
desertion
of
her
have
be
of
a
voluntary
character
.
<EOS>
She
know
,
or
fancy
she
know
,
him
by
far
too
well
for
that
;
and
she
more
than
once
express
her
opinion
,
to
the
effect
that
she
be
perfectly
convince
his
disappearance
be
a
part
and
parcel
of
all
that
train
of
circumstance
which
have
so
recently
occur
,
and
produce
such
a
world
of
unhappiness
to
her
,
as
well
as
to
the
whole
of
the
Bannerworth
family
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
he
have
never
love
me
,
"
she
say
to
her
brother
Henry
,
"
he
would
have
be
alive
and
well
;
but
he
have
fall
a
victim
to
the
truth
of
a
passion
,
and
to
the
constancy
of
an
affection
which
,
to
my
die
day
,
I
will
believe
in
.
"
 
<EOS>
now
that
Mr.
Marchdale
have
leave
the
place
there
be
no
one
to
dispute
this
proposition
with
Flora
,
for
all
,
as
well
as
she
,
be
fully
inclined
to
think
well
of
Charles
Holland
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
on
the
very
morning
which
precede
that
evening
when
Sir
Francis
Varney
call
upon
Charles
Holland
in
the
manner
we
have
relate
,
with
the
gratify
news
that
,
upon
certain
condition
,
he
may
be
release
,
that
Flora
Bannerworth
,
when
the
admiral
come
to
see
them
,
speak
to
him
of
Charles
Holland
,
saying,--
 
<EOS>
"
now
,
sir
,
that
I
be
away
from
Bannerworth
Hall
,
I
do
not
,
and
can
not
feel
satisfied
;
for
the
thought
that
Charles
may
eventually
come
back
,
and
seek
us
there
,
still
haunt
me
.
<EOS>
fancy
him
,
sir
,
do
so
,
and
see
the
place
completely
desert
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
there
be
something
in
that
,
"
say
the
admiral
;
"
but
,
however
,
he
be
hardly
such
a
goose
,
if
it
be
so
to
happen
,
to
give
up
the
chase
--
<EOS>
he'd
find
us
out
somehow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
think
he
would
,
sir
?
<EOS>
or
,
do
you
not
think
that
despair
would
seize
upon
him
,
and
that
,
fancy
we
have
all
leave
the
spot
for
ever
<EOS>
,
he
may
likewise
do
so
;
so
that
we
should
lose
him
more
effectually
than
we
have
do
at
present
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
;
hardly
,
"
say
the
admiral
;
"
he
could
not
be
such
a
goose
as
that
.
<EOS>
why
,
when
I
be
of
his
age
,
if
I
have
secure
the
affection
of
a
young
girl
like
you
,
I
would
have
go
over
all
the
world
,
but
I
would
have
find
out
where
she
be
;
and
what
I
mean
to
say
be
,
if
he
be
half
such
a
goose
as
you
think
him
,
he
deserve
to
lose
you
.

"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
not

me
something

Mr.
Chillingworth

yes

I
do

no

Jack
Pringle

put
up

with

scoundrel

how

a
way

remark
that
an

"--"Well

just
at
this
moment
Flora
Bannerworth
steal
into
the
room
from
whence
<EOS>
she
have
depart
a
short
time
since
;
but
when
she
see
that
old
Admiral
Bell
be
look
so
exceedingly
serious
,
and
apparently
about
to
address
Henry
upon
some
very
important
subject
,
she
would
have
retire
,
but
he
turn
towards
her
,
and
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
My
story
,
my
dear
,
I
have
no
objection
to
your
hearing
,
and
,
like
all
woman
folk
,
a
love
story
never
come
amiss
to
you
;
so
you
may
as
well
stay
and
hear
it
.
<EOS>
"--"a
<EOS>
love
story
,
"
say
Flora
;
"
you
tell
a
love
story
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
my
dear
,
and
not
only
tell
it
,
but
be
the
hero
of
it
,
likewise
;
be
not
<EOS>
you
astonished?"--"i
am
,
indeed
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
you
will
be
more
astonished
then
before
I
have
do
;
so
just
listen
.
<EOS>
as
Jack
Pringle
say
,
it
be
the
matter
of
about
somewhere
forty
year
ago
,
that
I
be
in
command
of
the
victory
frigate
,
which
be
place
upon
the
west
indian
station
,
during
a
war
then
rage
,
for
the
protection
of
our
port
and
harbour
in
that
vicinity
.
<EOS>
We
would
not
a
strong
force
in
that
quarter
,
therefore
,
I
have
to
cut
about
from
place
to
place
,
and
do
the
good
I
could
.
<EOS>
after
a
time
,
though
,
I
rather
think
that
we
frighten
off
the
enemy
,
during
which
time
I
chiefly
anchor
off
the
island
of
Antigua
,
and
be
hospitably
receive
at
the
house
of
a
planter
,
of
the
name
of
Marchant
,
who
,
in
fact
,
make
his
house
my
home
,
and
introduce
me
to
all
the
_
elite
_
of
the
society
of
the
island
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
Miss
Flora
,
you
have
no
idea
,
to
look
at
me
now
,
what
I
be
then
;
I
hold
a
captain
's
commission
,
and
be
nearly
the
young
man
in
the
service
,
with
such
a
rank
.
<EOS>
I
be
as
slender
,
ay
,
as
a
dancing
master
.
<EOS>
these
withered
and
bleach
lock
be
black
as
the
raven
's
plume
.
<EOS>
ay
,
ay
,
but
no
matter
:
the
planter
have
a
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
you
love
her
?
"
say
Flora--"Loved
her
,
"
say
the
old
man
,
and
the
flush
of
youthful
animation
come
to
his
countenance
;
"
love
her
,
do
you
say
!
<EOS>
I
adore
her
;
I
worship
her
;
she
be
to
me
--
but
what
a
d----d
old
fool
,
I
be
;
we
will
skip
that
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
nay
,
"
say
Flora
;
"
that
be
what
I
want
to
hear
.
<EOS>
"--"I
<EOS>
have
not
the
least
doubt
of
that
,
in
the
world
;
but
that
be
just
what
you
will
not
hear
;
none
of
your
nonsense
,
Miss
Flora
;
the
old
man
may
be
a
fool
,
but
he
be
not
quite
an
idiot
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
neither
,
"
say
Flora
;
"
true
feeling
can
never
disgrace
any
one

"--"perhaps
<EOS>
not
<EOS>
;

,
however
,
to
make
a
long
story
short
,
somehow
or
other
,
one
day
,
Belinda
be
sit
alone
,
and
I
rudely
pounce
upon
her
;
I
rather
think
then
I
must
have
say
something
that
I
ought
not
to
have
say
,
for
it
take
her
so
aback
;
I
be
force
,
somehow
or
other
,
to
hold
her
up
,
and
<EOS>
then
I
--
I
--
yes
<EOS>
;
I
be
sure
I
kiss
her
;
and
so
,
I
tell
her
I
love
her
;
and
then
,
what
do
you
think
she
say
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
Flora
,
"
that
she
reciprocate
the
passion
.
<EOS>
"--"D
<EOS>
--
<EOS>

<EOS>
my
rag

Jack
,
who
at
the
moment
come
into
the
room
,
"
I
suppose
that
be
the
name
of
some
shell
or
other
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
here
,
you
villain
!
"
say
the
admiral
;
"
I
think
you
be
go
.
<EOS>
"--"so
<EOS>
I
be
,
"
say
Jack
,
"
<EOS>

I
come
back
for
my
hat
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
away
he
go
again
,
and
the
admiral
resume
his
story
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
Miss
Flora
,
"
he
say
,
"
you
have
not
make
a
good
guess
,
as
she
do
not
say
anything
at
all
,
she
only
cling
to
me
like
some
wild
bird
to
its
mother
's
breast
,
and
cry
as
if
her
heart
would
break
.
"--"Indeed
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
do
not
know
the
cause
of
her
emotion
,
but
at
last
I
get
it
out
of
her
.
<EOS>
"--"What
be
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
a
mere
trifle
;
she
be
already
married
to
somebody
else
,
that
be
all
;
some
d----d
fellow
,
who
have
go
trade
about
the
island
,
a
fellow
she
do
not
care
a
straw
about
,
that
be
old
enough
to
be
her
father
.
"
 
"
and
you
leave
her?"--"No
,
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
guess
again
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
mad
-
headed
youngster
.
<EOS>
I
only
feel
--
I
do
not
think
.
<EOS>
I
persuade
her
to
come
away
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
take
her
aboard
my
ship
,
and
set
sail
with
her
.
<EOS>
a
few
week
fly
like
hour
;
but
one
day
we
be
hail
by
a
vessel
,
and
when
we
near
her
,
she
man
a
boat
and
bring
a
letter
on
board
,
address
to
Belinda
.
<EOS>
It
be
from
her
father
,
write
in
his
last
moment
.
<EOS>
It
begin
with
a
curse
and
end
with
a
blessing
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
postscript
in
another
hand
,
to
say
the
old
man
die
of
grief
.
<EOS>
She
read
it
by
my
side
on
the
quarter
-
deck
.
<EOS>
It
drop
from
her
grasp
,
and
she
plunge
into
the
sea
.
<EOS>
Jack
Pringle
go
after
her
;
but
I
never
see
her
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Gracious
Heavens
!
<EOS>
what
a
<EOS>
tragedy!"--"yes
,
tolerable
,
"
say
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
arise
and
take
his
hat
and
place
it
on
his
head
.
<EOS>
He
give
the
crown
of
it
a
blow
that
send
it
nearly
over
his
eye
.
<EOS>
He
thrust
his
hand
deep
into
his
breech
pocket
,
clench
his
tooth
,
and
mutter
something
inaudible
as
he
stride
from
the
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
"
who
would
have
think
,
Henry
,
"
say
Flora
,
"
that
such
a
man
as
Admiral
Bell
have
be
the
hero
of
such
an
adventure?"--"Ay
<EOS>
,
who
indeed
;
but
it
show
that
we
never
can
judge
from
appearance
,
Flora
;
and
that
those
who
seem
to
us
the
most
heart
-
whole
may
have
experience
the
wildest
vicissitude
of
passion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
we
must
remember
,
likewise
,
that
this
be
forty
year
ago
,
Henry
,
which
make
a
material
difference
in
the
state
of
the
case
as
regard
Admiral
Bell
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
do
indeed
--
more
than
half
a
lifetime
;
and
yet
how
evident
it
be
that
his
old
feeling
clung
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
can
well
imagine
the
many
hour
of
bitter
regret
which
the
memory
of
this
his
lose
love
must
have
give
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
true
--
true
.
<EOS>
I
can
feel
something
for
him
;
for
have
I
not
lose
one
who
love
me
--
a
bad
loss
,
too
,
than
that
which
Admiral
Bell
relate
;
for
be
I
not
a
prey
to
all
the
horror
of
uncertainty
?
<EOS>
whereas
he
know
the
bad
,
and
that
,
at
all
event
,
death
have
claim
its
victim
,
leave
nothing
to
conjecture
in
the
shape
of
suffering
,
so
that
the
mind
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
recover
slowly
,
but
surely
,
as
it
would
from
the
shock
which
it
have
receive
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
bad
than
you
,
Flora

but
rather
would
I
have
you
<EOS>
cherish
hope
of
soon
behold
Charles
Holland
,
probably
alive
and
well
,
than
fancy
<EOS>
any
great
disaster
have
come
over
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
endeavour
to
do
so
,
"
reply
Flora
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
long
to
hear
what
have
become
of
Dr.
Chillingworth
.
<EOS>
His
disappearance
be
most
singular
;
for
I
fully
suspect
that
he
have
some
particular
object
in
view
in
get
possession
for
a
short
time
of
Bannerworth
Hall
;
but
now
,
from
Jack
Pringle
's
account
,
he
appear
not
to
be
in
it
,
and
,
in
fact
,
to
have
disappear
completely
from
the
sight
of
all
who
know
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Flora
;
"
but
he
may
have
do
that
,
brother
,
<EOS>
still
in
furtherance
of
his
object
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
so
,
and
I
will
hope
that
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
keep
yourself
close
,
sister
,
and
see
no
one
,
while
I
proceed
to
his
house
to
inquire
if
they
have
hear
anything
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
will
return
soon
,
be
assure
;
and
,
in
the
meantime
,
should
you
see
my
brother
,
tell
him
I
shall
be
at
home
in
an
hour
or
so
,
and
not
to
leave
the
cottage
;
for
it
be
more
than
likely
that
the
admiral
have
go
to
Bannerworth
Hall
,
so
that
you
may
not
see
anything
of
him
for
some
time

be
the
soul
of
honour
,
and
the
least
likely
man
in
all
the
world
to
infringe
in
the
slight
upon
the
condition
which
he
have
,
of
his
own
free
will
,
accede
to
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
walk
rapidly
until
he
come
nearly
to
the
outskirt
of
the
town
,
and
then
he
slacken
his
pace
,
proceed
more
cautiously
,
and
look
carefully
about
him
,
as
if
he
fear
to
meet
any
one
who
may
recognise
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
proceed
far
in
this
manner
,
when
he
become
conscious
of
the
cautious
figure
of
a
man
glide
along
in
the
opposite
direction
to
that
which
he
be
take
.
 
<EOS>
a
suspicion
strike
him
,
from
the
general
appearance
,
that
it
be
Marchdale
,
and
if
so
he
wonder
to
see
him
abroad
at
such
a
time
.
<EOS>
still
he
would
not
be
quite
certain
;
but
he
hurry
forward
,
so
as
to
meet
the
advance
figure
,
and
then
his
suspicion
be
confirm
;
and
Marchdale
,
with
some
confusion
in
his
look
and
manner
,
accost
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
"
he
say
,
"
you
be
out
late
.
<EOS>
"--
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
know
I
should
be
out
late
,
"
say
Varney
,
"
and
you
likewise
know
the
errand
upon
which
I
be
to
be
out
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
recollect
;
you
be
to
release
your
prisoner
.
<EOS>
"--
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
have
you
do
so?"--
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
--
I
be
glad
you
have
take
well
thought
of
it
.
<EOS>
good
night
--
<EOS>
good
night
;
we
shall
meet
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"--
 
<EOS>
"
Adieu
,
"
say
Sir
Francis
Varney
;
and
he
watch
the
retreating
figure
of
Marchdale
,
and
then
he
add
,
in
a
low
tone
to
himself,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
his
object
well
.
<EOS>
His
craven
spirit
shrink
at
the
notion
,
a
probable
enough
one
<EOS>
,
I
will
admit
,
that
Charles
Holland
have
recognise
him
,
and
that
,
if
once
free
,
he
would
denounce
him
to
the
Bannerworths
,
hold
him
up
to
scorn
in
his
true
colour
,
and
bring
down
upon
his
head
,
perhaps
,
something
more
than
detestation
and
contempt
.
<EOS>
the
villain
!
<EOS>
he
be
go
now
to
take
the
life
of
the
man
whom
he
consider
chain
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
well
,
well
,
they
must
fight
it
out
together
.
<EOS>
Charles
Holland
be
sufficiently
free
to
take
his
own
part
,
although
Marchdale
little
think
that
such
be
the
case
.
"
 
<EOS>
Marchdale
walk
on
for
some
little
distance
,
and
then
he
turn
and
look
after
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
"
he
say
;
"
so
you
have
not
release
him
to
-
night
,
but
<EOS>
I
know
well
will
do
so
soon
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
,
for
my
part
,
admire
this
romantic
generosity
which
set
a
fox
free
at
the
moment
that
he
be
the
most
dangerous
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
very
well
to
be
generous
,
but
it
be
well
to
be
just
first
,
and
that
I
consider
mean
look
after
one
's
self
first
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
poniard
here
which
will
soon
put
an
end
to
the
trouble
of
the
prisoner
in
his
dungeon
<EOS>
--
its
edge
be
keen
and
sharp
,
and
will
readily
find
a
way
to
his
heart
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
walk
on
quite
exultingly
and
carelessly
now
,
for
he
have
get
into
the
open
country
,
and
it
be
extremely
unlikely
that
he
would
meet
anybody
on
his
road
to
the
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
It
do
not
take
many
minute
,
sharp
walking
now
to
bring
him
close
to
the
spot
which
he
intend
should
become
such
a
scene
of
treacherous
slaughter
,
and
just
then
he
hear
from
afar
off
something
like
the
muttering
of
thunder
,
as
if
Heaven
itself
be
proclaim
its
vengeance
against
the
man
who
have
come
out
to
slay
one
of
its
good
and
noblest
creature
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
'
"
say
Marchdale
,
shrink
back
a
moment
;
"
what
be
that
--
an
approach
storm
?
<EOS>
It
must
be
so
,
for
,
<EOS>
now
I
recollect
me
,
the
sun
set
behind
a
bank
of
cloud
of
a
fiery
redness
,
and
as
the
evening
draw
in
there
be
every
appearance
in
the
heaven
of
some
ensue
strife
of
the
element
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
listen
for
a
few
moment
,
and
fix
his
eye
intently
in
the
direction
of
the
horizon
from
where
the
muttering
sound
have
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
long
to
wait
before
he
see
a
bright
flash
of
blue
lightning
,
which
for
one
instant
illumine
the
sky
;
then
by
the
time
he
could
have
count
twelve
there
<EOS>
come
the
thunder
which
the
flash
precede
,
and
he
feel
terribly
anxious
to
complete
his
enterprize
,
so
that
he
may
get
back
to
the
town
and
be
safely
house
before
the
storm
,
which
be
evidently
approach
,
should
burst
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
sweep
on
apace
,
"
he
say
;
"
why
do
I
not
come
earlier
?
"
 
<EOS>
even
as
he
speak
he
plunge
among
the
recess
of
the
ruin
,
and
search
about
for
the
old
stone
which
cover
the
entrance
to
the
dungeon
,
he
be
surprised
to
find
it
roll
from
its
place
,
and
the
aperture
open
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
meaning
of
this
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
;
"
how
negligent
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
;
or
perhaps
,
after
all
,
he
be
only
jest
with
me
,
and
let
the
prisoner
go
.
<EOS>
if
that
should
be
the
case
,
I
be
foil
indeed
;
but
surely
he
could
not
be
so
full
of
indiscretion
.
"
 
<EOS>
again
come
a
dazzling
flash
of
lightning
,
which
now
,
surround
by
the
ruin
as
he
be
,
make
him
shrink
back
and
cover
his
eye
for
a
moment
;
and
then
follow
a
peal
of
thunder
with
not
half
the
duration
of
time
between
it
and
the
flash
which
have
characterize
the
previous
electric
phenomenon
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
storm
approach
fast
,
"
say
Marchdale
;
"
I
must
get
my
work
do
quickly
,
if
indeed
my
victim
be
here
,
which
I
begin
seriously
to
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
descend
the
intricate
wind
passage
to
the
vault
below
,
which
serve
the
purpose
of
a
dungeon
,
and
when
he
get
very
nearly
into
the
depth
of
its
recess
,
he
call
aloud
,
saying,--
 
<EOS>
"
Ho
!
<EOS>
what
ho
!
<EOS>
be
there
any
one
here?"--"yes
,
"
say
Charles
Holland
,
who
fancy
it
may
be
his
former
visitor
return
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
you
come
to
repent
of
your
purpose
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
say
Marchdale
to
himself
,
"
Sir
Francis
,
after
all
,
have
tell
me
the
truth
--
the
prisoner
be
still
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
light
from
without
be
not
near
sufficient
to
send
the
least
ray
into
the
depth
of
that
dungeon
;
so
that
Marchdale
,
when
he
enter
the
place
,
could
see
nothing
but
an
absolute
blackness
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
so
,
however
,
with
Charles
Holland
,
whose
eye
have
be
now
so
long
accustomed
to
the
place
that
he
could
see
in
it
as
if
a
dim
twilight
irradiate
it
,
and
he
at
once
,
in
his
visitor
,
see
his
bad
foe
,
and
not
the
man
who
have
comparatively
set
him
free
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
,
too
,
that
the
hand
of
his
visitor
grasp
a
weapon
,
which
Marchdale
think
that
,
favour
by
the
darkness
,
he
may
carry
openly
in
perfect
security
.
 
<EOS>
"
where
be
you
?
"
say
Marchdale
;
"
I
can
not
see
you
.
<EOS>
"--"Here
<EOS>
!
"
say
Charles
,
"
you
may
feel
my
grip
;
"
and
he
spring
upon
him
in
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
the
attack
be
so
sudden
and
so
utterly
unexpected
,
that
Marchdale
be
throw
backwards
,
and
the
dagger
wrest
from
his
grasp
,
during
the
first
impulse
which
Charles
Holland
have
throw
into
his
attack
.
 
<EOS>
moreover
,
his
head
strike
with
such
violence
against
the
earthern
floor
,
that
it
produce
a
temporary
confusion
of
his
faculty
,
so
that
,
have
Charles
Holland
be
so
inclined
,
he
may
,
with
Marchdale
's
own
weapon
,
have
easily
take
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
man
do
,
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
,
raise
it
in
his
hand
,
but
,
on
the
impulse
of
another
thought
,
he
cast
it
from
him
,
exclaiming--
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
!
<EOS>
not
that
;
I
should
be
as
bad
as
he
,
or
nearly
so
.
<EOS>
this
villain
have
come
to
murder
me
,
but
yet
I
will
not
take
his
life
for
the
deed
.
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
with
him
?
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
a
lucky
thought
--
chain
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
drag
Marchdale
to
the
identical
spot
of
earth
on
which
he
have
lain
so
long
;
and
,
as
Sir
Francis
Varney
have
leave
the
key
of
the
padlock
which
bind
the
chain
together
in
it
,
he
,
in
a
few
moment
,
have
succeed
in
place
the
villain
Marchdale
in
the
same
durance
from
which
he
have
himself
shortly
since
escape
.
 
<EOS>
"
remain
there
,
"
he
say
,
"
until
some
one
come
to
rescue
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
let
you
starve
to
death
,
but
I
will
give
you
a
long
fast
;
and
,
when
I
come
again
,
it
shall
be
along
with
some
of
the
Bannerworth
family
,
to
show
them
what
a
viper
they
have
foster
in
their
heart
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Marchdale
be
just
sufficiently
conscious
now
to
feel
all
the
reality
of
his
situation
.
<EOS>
in
vain
he
attempt
to
rise
from
his
prostrate
position
.
<EOS>
the
chain
do
their
duty
,
keep
down
a
villain
with
the
same
mean
that
they
have
hold
in
ignominious
confinement
a
true
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
in
a
perfect
agony
,
inasmuch
as
he
consider
that
he
would
be
allow
to
remain
there
to
starve
to
death
,
thus
achieve
for
himself
a
more
horrible
death
than
any
he
have
ever
think
of
inflicting
.
 
<EOS>
"
Villain
!
"
exclaim
Charles
Holland
,
"
you
shall
there
remain
;
and
,
let
you
have
what
mental
suffering
<EOS>
you
may
,
you
richly
deserve
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
heed
not
the
cry
of
Marchdale
--
he
heed
not
his
imprecation
any
more
than
he
do
his
prayer
;
and
the
arch
hypocrite
use
both
in
abundance
.
<EOS>
Charles
be
but
too
happy
once
more
to
look
upon
the
open
sky
,
although
it
be
then
in
darkness
,
to
heed
anything
that
Marchdale
,
in
the
agony
to
which
he
be
now
reduce
,
may
feel
inclined
to
say
;
and
,
after
glance
around
him
for
some
few
moment
,
when
he
be
free
of
the
ruin
,
and
inhale
with
exquisite
delight
the
free
air
of
the
surround
meadow
,
he
see
,
by
the
twinkling
of
the
light
,
in
which
direction
the
town
lie
,
and
know
that
by
take
a
line
in
that
path
,
and
then
after
a
time
diverge
a
little
to
the
right
,
he
should
come
to
Bannerworth
Hall
,
he
walk
on
,
never
in
his
whole
life
probably
feel
such
an
enjoyment
of
the
mere
fact
of
existence
as
at
such
a
moment
as
that
of
exquisite
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
Our
reader
may
with
us
imagine
what
it
be
to
taste
the
free
,
fresh
air
of
heaven
,
after
be
long
pen
up
,
as
he
,
Charles
Holland
,
have
be
,
in
a
damp
,
noisome
dungeon
,
teem
with
unwholesome
exhalation
.
<EOS>
They
may
well
suppose
with
what
an
amount
of
rapture
he
now
find
himself
unrestrained
in
his
movement
by
those
gall
fetter
which
have
hang
for
so
long
a
period
upon
his
youthful
limb
,
and
which
,
not
unfrequently
in
the
despair
of
his
heart
,
he
have
think
he
should
surely
die
in
.
 
<EOS>
and
last
,
although
not
least
in
his
dear
esteem
,
do
the
rapturous
thought
of
once
more
look
in
the
sweet
face
of
her
he
love
come
<EOS>
cross
him
with
a
gush
of
delight
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
,
as
he
quicken
his
pace
;
"
yes
!
<EOS>
I
shall
be
able
to
tell
Flora
Bannerworth
<EOS>
how
well
and
how
truly
I
love
her
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
able
to
tell
her
that
,
in
my
weary
and
hideous
imprisonment
,
the
thought
alone
of
her
have
support
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
he
near
the
Hall
,
he
quicken
his
pace
to
such
an
extent
,
that
soon
he
be
force
to
pause
altogether
,
as
the
exertion
he
have
undertake
pretty
plainly
tell
him
that
the
imprisonment
,
scanty
diet
,
and
want
of
exercise
,
which
have
be
his
portion
for
some
time
past
,
have
most
materially
decrease
his
strength
.
 
<EOS>
His
limb
tremble
,
and
a
profuse
perspiration
bedew
his
brow
,
although
the
night
be
rather
cold
than
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
weak
,
"
he
say
;
"
<EOS>
and
much
I
wonder
now
that
I
succeed
in
overcoming
that
villain
Marchdale
;
who
,
if
I
have
not
do
so
,
would
most
assuredly
have
murder
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
a
wonder
;
for
Marchdale
be
not
an
old
man
,
although
he
may
be
consider
certainly
as
past
the
prime
of
life
,
and
he
be
of
a
strong
and
athletic
build
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
the
suddenness
of
his
attack
upon
him
which
have
give
Charles
Holland
the
great
advantage
,
and
have
cause
the
defeat
of
the
ruffian
who
come
bent
on
one
of
the
most
cowardly
and
dastardly
murder
that
could
be
commit
--
namely
,
upon
an
unoffending
man
,
whom
he
suppose
to
be
load
with
chain
,
and
incapable
of
make
the
least
efficient
resistance
.
 
<EOS>
Charles
soon
again
recover
sufficient
breath
and
strength
to
proceed
towards
the
Hall
,
and
now
warn
,
by
the
exhaustion
which
have
come
over
him
that
he
have
not
really
anything
like
strength
enough
to
allow
him
to
proceed
rapidly
,
he
walk
with
slow
and
deliberate
step
.
 
<EOS>
this
mode
of
proceeding
be
more
favourable
to
reflection
than
the
wild
,
rapid
one
which
he
have
at
first
adopt
,
and
in
all
the
glow
colour
of
youthful
and
ingenious
fancy
do
he
depict
to
himself
the
surprise
and
the
pleasure
that
would
beam
in
the
countenance
of
his
beloved
Flora
when
she
should
find
him
once
again
by
her
side
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
,
he
,
Charles
,
could
know
nothing
of
the
contrivance
which
have
be
resort
to
,
and
which
the
reader
may
lay
wholly
to
the
charge
of
Marchdale
,
to
blacken
his
character
,
and
to
make
him
appear
faithless
to
the
love
he
have
profess
.
 
<EOS>
have
he
know
this
<EOS>
,
it
be
probable
that
indignation
would
have
add
wing
to
his
progress
,
and
he
would
not
have
be
able
to
proceed
at
the
leisurely
pace
<EOS>
he
feel
that
his
state
of
physical
weakness
dictate
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
he
see
the
topmost
portion
at
Bannerworth
Hall
push
out
from
amongst
the
tree
with
which
the
ancient
pile
be
so
much
surrounded
,
and
the
sight
of
the
home
of
his
beloved
revive
him
,
and
quicken
the
circulation
of
the
warm
blood
in
his
vein
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
behold
her
now
,
"
he
said--"I
shall
behold
her
how
!
<EOS>
a
few
minute
more
,
<EOS>
and
I
shall
hold
her
to
my
heart
--
that
heart
which
have
be
ever
her
,
and
which
carry
her
image
enshrine
in
its
deep
recess
,
even
into
the
gloom
of
a
dungeon
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
let
us
,
while
Charles
Holland
be
indulge
in
these
delightful
anticipation
--
anticipation
which
,
we
regret
,
in
consequence
of
the
departure
of
the
bannerworth
from
the
Hall
,
will
not
be
realize
so
soon
as
he
suppose
--
look
back
upon
the
discomfited
hypocrite
and
villain
,
Marchdale
,
who
occupy
his
place
in
the
dungeon
of
the
old
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
until
Charles
Holland
actually
have
leave
the
strange
,
horrible
,
and
cell
-
like
place
,
he
could
scarcely
make
up
his
mind
that
the
young
man
entertain
a
serious
intention
of
leave
him
there
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
he
do
not
think
any
one
could
be
so
cruel
and
so
wicked
as
he
himself
;
for
the
reader
will
no
doubt
recollect
that
his
,
Marchdale
's
,
counsel
to
Varney
,
be
to
leave
Charles
Holland
to
his
fate
,
chain
down
as
he
be
in
the
dungeon
,
and
that
fate
would
have
be
the
horrible
one
of
be
starve
to
death
in
the
course
of
a
few
day
.
 
<EOS>
when
now
,
however
,
he
feel
confident
that
he
be
desert
--
when
he
hear
the
sound
of
Charles
Holland
's
retreat
footstep
slowly
die
away
in
the
distance
,
until
not
the
faint
echo
of
them
reach
his
ear
,
he
despair
indeed
;
and
the
horror
he
experience
during
the
succeed
ten
minute
,
may
be
consider
an
ample
atonement
for
some
of
his
crime
.
<EOS>
His
brain
be
in
a
complete
whirl
;
nothing
of
a
tangible
nature
,
but
that
he
be
there
,
chain
down
,
and
leave
to
starve
to
death
,
come
across
his
intellect
.
<EOS>
then
a
kind
of
madness
,
for
a
moment
or
two
,
take
possession
of
him
;
he
make
a
tremendous
effort
to
burst
asunder
the
band
that
hold
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
in
vain
.
<EOS>
the
chain
--
which
have
be
place
upon
Charles
Holland
during
the
first
few
day
of
his
confinement
,
when
he
have
a
little
recover
from
the
effect
of
the
violence
which
have
be
commit
upon
him
at
the
time
when
he
be
capture
--
effectually
resist
Marchdale
.
 
<EOS>
They
even
cut
into
his
flesh
,
inflict
upon
him
some
grievous
wound
;
but
that
be
all
he
achieve
by
his
great
effort
to
free
himself
,
so
that
,
after
a
few
moment
,
bleed
and
in
great
pain
,
he
,
with
a
deep
groan
,
desist
from
the
fruitless
effort
he
have
well
not
have
commence
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
remain
silent
for
a
time
,
but
it
be
not
the
silence
of
reflection
;
it
be
that
of
exhaustion
,
and
,
as
such
,
be
not
likely
to
last
long
;
nor
do
it
,
for
,
in
the
course
of
another
five
minute
,
he
call
out
loudly
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
he
think
there
may
be
a
remote
chance
that
some
one
traverse
the
meadow
would
hear
him
;
and
<EOS>
yet
,
if
he
have
duly
consider
the
matter
,
which
he
be
not
in
a
fitting
frame
of
mind
to
do
,
he
would
have
recollect
that
,
in
choose
a
dungeon
among
the
underground
vault
of
these
ruin
,
he
have
,
by
experiment
,
make
certain
that
no
cry
,
however
loud
,
from
where
he
lie
,
could
reach
the
upper
air
.
<EOS>
and
thus
have
this
villain
,
by
the
very
precaution
which
he
have
<EOS>
himself
take
to
ensure
the
safe
custody
of
another
,
be
his
own
great
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
"
help
!
<EOS>
help
!
<EOS>
help

"
<EOS>
he
cry
frantically
"
Varney
!
<EOS>
Charles

<EOS>
have
mercy
upon
me
,
and
do
not
leave
me
here
to

curse
on
all
your

oh

<EOS>
in
suchlike
incoherent
expression
do
he
pass
some
hour
,
until
,
what
with
exhaustion
and
a
rage
thirst
that
come
over
him
,
he
could
not
utter
another
word

but
lie
the
very
picture
of
despair
and
discomfited
malice
and
wickedness

BANNERWORTH
and
HER
<EOS>
mother.--the
episode
of
CHIVALRY
.
  
<EOS>
[

<EOS>
gladly
we
turn
from
such
a
man
as
Marchdale
to
a
consideration
of
the
beautiful
and
accomplish
Flora
Bannerworth
,
to
whom
we
may
,
without
destroy
in
any
way
the
interest
of
our
plot
,
predict
a
much
happy
destiny
than
,
<EOS>
probably
,
at
that
time
,
she
consider
as
at
all
likely
to
be
hers
.
 
<EOS>
She
certainly
enjoy
,
upon
her
first
removal
from
Bannerworth
Hall
,
great
serenity
of
mind
than
she
have
do
there
;
but
,
as
we
have
already
remark
of
her
,
the
more
her
mind
be
withdraw
,
by
change
of
scene
,
from
the
horrible
consideration
which
the
attack
of
the
vampyre
have
force
upon
her
,
<EOS>
the
more
she
revert
to
the
fate
of
Charles
Holland
,
which
be
still
shroud
in
so
much
gloom
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
sit
and
converse
with
her
mother
upon
that
subject
until
she
work
up
her
feeling
to
a
most
uncomfortable
pitch
of
excitement
,
and
then
Mrs.
Bannerworth
would
get
her
young
brother
to
join
them
,
who
would
occasionally
read
to
her
some
composition
of
his
own
,
or
of
some
favourite
writer
whom
he
think
would
amuse
her
.

[

<EOS>
It
be
on
the
very
evening
when
Sir
Francis
Varney
have
make
up
his
mind
to
release
Charles
Holland
,
that
young
Bannerworth
read
to
his
sister
and
his
mother
the
follow
little
chivalric
incident
,
which
he
tell
them
he
have
himself
collate
from
authentic
<EOS>
sources:--
 
<EOS>
"
the
knight
with
the
green
shield
,
"
exclaim
one
of
a
party
of
man
-
at
-
arm
,
who
be
drink
together
at
an
ancient
hostel
,
not
far
from
Shrewsbury--"the
knight
with
the
green
shield
be
as
good
a
knight
as
ever
buckle
on
a
sword
,
or
wear
spur
.
<EOS>
"--"Then
<EOS>
how
come
it
<EOS>
he
be
not
one
of
the
victor
in
the
day
's
tournament
?
"
<EOS>
exclaim
another.--"By
the
bone
of
Alfred
!
<EOS>
"
say
a
third
,
"
a
man
must
be
judge
of
by
his
desert
,
and
not
by
the
partiality
of
his
friend
.
<EOS>
that
be
my
opinion
,
friend
.
<EOS>
"--"And
<EOS>
mine
,
too
,
"
say
another
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
all
very
true
,
and
my
opinion
would
go
with
yours
,
too
;
but
not
in
this
instance
.
<EOS>
though
you
may
accuse
me
of
partiality
,
yet
I
be
not
so
;
for
I
have
see
some
of
the
victor
of
to
-
day
by
no
means
forward
in
the
press
of
battle
<EOS>
-
man
who
,
I
will
not
say
fear
danger
,
but
who
like
it
not
<EOS>
so
well
<EOS>
but
they
avoid
it
as
much
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
marry
,
and
so
have
<EOS>
I.
the
reason
be
,
'
tis
much
easy
to
face
a
blunt
lance
,
than
one
with
a
spear
-
head
;
and
a
man
may
practise
the
one
and
thrive
in
it
,
but
not
the
other
;
for
the
good
lance
in
the
tournament
be
not
always
the
good
arm
in
the
battle
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
that
be
the
reason
of
my
say
the
knight
with
the
green
shield
be
a
good
knight
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
him
in
the
midst
of
the
melee
,
when
man
and
horse
have
be
hurl
to
the
ground
by
the
shock
;
there
he
have
behave
himself
like
a
brave
knight
,
and
have
more
than
once
be
notice
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
how
canne
he
to
be
so
easily
overthrow
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
that
speak
something
.
<EOS>
"--"His
<EOS>
horse
be
an
old
one
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
much
the
well
,
"
say
another
;
"
he
be
use
to
his
work
,
and
as
cunning
as
an
old
man
.
<EOS>
"--"but
<EOS>
he
have
be
wound
more
than
once
,
and
be
weaken
very
much
:
<EOS>
besides
,
I
see
him
lose
his
footing
,
else
he
have
overthrow
his
opponent
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
do
not
seem
distressed
about
his
accident
,
at
all
event
,
but
sit
contented
in
the
tent
.
<EOS>
"--"he
know
well
that
those
who
know
him
will
never
attribute
his
misadventure
either
to
want
of
courage
or
conduct
;
moreover
,
he
seem
to
be
one
of
those
who
care
but
little
for
the
opinion
of
man
who
care
nothing
for
him

he

go
by

<EOS>
"--"a

shout
the
man

at

arm
,
as
they
lift
their
cup
on
high

<EOS>
"
who
be
he

"
<EOS>
inquire
one
of
the
man

at

of
him
who
have
speak
favourably
of
the
stranger.--"i
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
yet
you
speak
favourably
of
him
a
few
second
back
,
and
say
what
a
brave
knight
<EOS>
he
was!"--"and
<EOS>
so
I
uphold
him
to
be
;
but
<EOS>
,
I
tell
you
what
,
friend
,
I
would
do
as
much
for
the
great
stranger
I
ever
meet
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
him
fight
where
man
and
horse
have
bite
the
dust
in
hundred
;
and
that
,
in
my
opinion
,
speak
out
for
the
man
and
warrior
;
he
who
can
not
,
then
,
fight
like
a
soldier
,
have
well
tilt
at
home
in
the
castle
-
yard
,
and
there
win
lady
'
smile
,
but
not
the
commendation
of
the
leader
of
the
battle
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
:
I
myself
recollect
very
well
Sir
Hugh
de
Colbert
,
a
very
accomplished
knight
in
the
castle
-
yard
;
but
his
man
be
as
fine
<EOS>
a
set
of
fellow
as
ever
cross
a
horse
,
to
look
at
,
but
they
prove
deficient
at
the
moment
of
trial
;
they
be
break
,
and
flee
in
a
moment
,
and
scarce
one
of
them
receive
a
scratch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
they
have
not
stand
the
shock
of
the
foeman?"--"No
;
that
be
certain
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
still
I
should
like
to
know
the
knight,--to
know
his
name
very
well
.
<EOS>
"--"I
<EOS>
know
it
not
;
he
have
some
reason
for
keep
it
secret
,
I
suppose
;
but
his
deed
will
not
shame
it
,
be
it
what
it
may

<EOS>
I
can
bear
witness
to
more
than
one
foeman
fall
beneath
his
battle
-
axe
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed!"--"Yes
;
and
he
take
a
banner
from
the
enemy
in
the
last
battle
that
be
fight
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
well
!
<EOS>
he
deserve
a
well
fortune
to

morrow

<EOS>
who
be
to
be
the
bridegroom
of
the
beautiful
Bertha
,
daughter
of
Lord
de
cauci?"--"that
will
have
to
be
decide
:
but
it
be
presume
that
Sir
Guthrie
de
Beaumont
be
the
intended
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
but
should
he
not
prove
the
victor?"--"It
's
understand
;
because
it
be

he
be
intend
by
the
parent
of
the
lady
,
and
none
would
be
ungallant
enough
to
prevail
against
him,--save
on
such
condition
as
would
not
endanger
the
fruit
of
victory
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no?"--"certainly
not
;
they
would
lay
the
trophy
at
the
foot
of
the
beauty
worship
by
the
knight
at
the
tournament
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
,
triumphant
or
not

he
be
to
be
the
bridegroom
;
bear
off
the
prize
of
valour
whether
or
no,--in
fact

deserve
her

not,--that
be
the
fact

<EOS>
"--"So
<EOS>
it
be

so
it
be

<EOS>
"
 
"
and
a
shame
,
too

friend
;
but
so
it
be
now

yet
,
if
the

recover
from

it
strike
me

his
country,--one
who
be
not
so
rich
in
land
as
her
present
bridegroom
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
leave
her
,
she
remember
his
promise
;
it
be
,
to
fight
on
till
he
earn
a
fortune
,
or
name
that
should
give
him
some
right
to
claim
her
hand
,
even
from
her
imperious
father
.
<EOS>
but
alas
!
<EOS>
he
come
not
;
and
what
could
she
do
against
the
command
of
one
who
would
be
obey
?
<EOS>
Her
mother
,
too
,
be
a
proud
,
haughty
woman
,
one
whose
sole
anxiety
be
to
increase
the
grandeur
and
power
of
her
house
by
such
connection
.
 
<EOS>
thus
it
be
press
on
by
circumstance
,
she
could
no
longer
hold
out
,
more
especially
as
she
hear
nothing
of
her
knight
.
<EOS>
She
know
not
where
he
be
,
or
indeed
if
he
be
live
or
dead
.
<EOS>
She
know
not
he
be
never
name
.
<EOS>
this
last
circumstance
,
indeed
,
give
her
pain
;
for
it
assure
her
that
he
whom
she
love
have
be
unable
to
signalize
himself
from
among
other
man
.
<EOS>
that
,
in
fact
,
he
be
unknown
in
the
annal
of
fame
,
as
well
as
the
probability
that
he
have
be
slay
in
some
of
the
early
skirmish
of
the
war
.
<EOS>
this
,
if
it
have
happen
,
cause
her
some
pain
to
think
upon
;
not
but
such
event
be
look
upon
with
almost
indifference
by
female
,
save
in
such
case
where
their
affection
be
engage
,
as
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
but
the
event
be
soften
by
the
fact
that
man
be
continually
fall
by
the
hand
of
man
in
such
encounter
,
but
at
the
same
time
it
be
consider
an
honourable
and
praiseworthy
death
for
a
soldier
.
<EOS>
He
be
wound
,
but
not
with
the
anguish
we
now
hear
of
;
for
the
friend
be
console
by
the
reflection
that
the
deceased
warrior
die
cover
with
glory
.
 
<EOS>
Bertha
,
however
,
be
young
,
and
as
yet
she
know
not
the
cause
of
<EOS>
her
absent
knight
's
silence
,
or
why
he
have
not
be
hear
of
among
the
most
forward
in
the
battle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
's
will
be
do
,
"
she
exclaim
;
"
what
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
I
must
submit
to
my
father
's
behest
;
but
my
future
life
will
be
one
of
misery
and
sorrow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
weep
to
think
of
the
past
,
and
to
dream
of
the
future
;
both
alike
be
sorrowful
to
think
upon
--
no
comfort
in
the
past
and
no
joy
in
the
future
.
 
<EOS>
thus
she
weep
and
sorrow
on
the
night
of
the
first
tournament
;
there
be
to
be
a
second
,
and
that
be
to
be
the
grand
one
,
where
her
intended
bridegroom
be
to
show
himself
off
in
her
eye
,

his

in

as
yet
the
town
be
quiet
;
and
,
though
there
be
no
appearance
of
riot
or
disturbance
,
yet
the
magistracy
have
take
every
precaution
they
deem
needful
,
or
their
position
and
necessity
warrant
,
to
secure
the
peace
of
the
town
from
the
like
disturbance
to
that
which
have
be
,
of
late
,
a
disgrace
and
terror
of
peaceably
-
dispose
person
.
 
<EOS>
the
populace
be
well
advertise
of
the
fact
,
that
the
body
of
the
stranger
be
to
be
bury
that
morning
in
their
churchyard
;
and
that
,
to
protect
the
body
,
should
there
be
any
necessity
for
so
do
,
a
large
body
of
constable
would
be
employ
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
disposition
to
riot
;
at
least
,
none
be
visible
.
<EOS>
It
look
as
if
there
be
some
event
about
to
take
place
that
be
highly
interesting
to
all
party
,
who
be
peaceably
assemble
to
witness
the
interment
of
nobody
<EOS>
know
who
.
 
<EOS>
the
early
hour
at
which
person
be
assemble
,
at
different
point
,
clearly
indicate
that
there
be
a
spirit
of
curiosity
about
the
town
,
so
uncommon
that
none
would
have
notice
it
<EOS>
but
for
the
fact
of
the
crowd
of
people
who
hang
about
the
street
,
and
there
remain
,
listless
and
impatient
.
 
<EOS>
the
inn
,
too
,
be
crowd
with
visitor
,
and
there
be
many
who
,
not
be
bless
with
the
strength
of
purse
that
some
be
,
be
hang
about
in
the
distance
,
wait
and
watch
the
motion
of
those
who
be
better
provide
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
"
say
one
of
the
visitor
,
"
this
be
a
disagreeable
job
in
your
house
,
landlord
.
<EOS>
"--"Yes
,
sir
;
I
would
sooner
it
have
happen
elsewhere
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
have
do
me
no
good
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
;
no
man
could
expect
any
,
and
yet
it
be
none
the
less
unfortunate
for
that
.
<EOS>
"--"I
<EOS>
would
sooner
anything
else
happen
than
that
,
whatever
it
may
be
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
must
be
something
very
bad
,
at
all
event
;
but
I
dare
say
I
shall
never
see
the
like
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
much
the
well
for
the
town
,
"
say
another
;
"
for
,
what
with
vampyre
and
riot
,
there
have
be
but
little
else
stir
than
mischief
and
disturbance
of
one
kind
and
another
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
and
,
what
between
Varneys
and
Bannerworths
,
we
have
have
but
little
peace
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
precisely
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
it
be
my
opinion
that
the
least
thing
would
upset
the
whole
town
.
<EOS>
any
one
unlucky
word
would
do
it
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
,
"
say
a
tall
thin
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
of
it
,
"
say
another
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
hope
the
military
would
do
their
duty
under
such
circumstance
,
for
people
's
life
and
property
be
not
safe
in
such
a
state
of
thing
.
<EOS>
"--"oh
<EOS>
,
dear
no
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
have
become
of
Varney
,
or
where
he
can
have
go
to
.
<EOS>
"--"Some
think
he
must
have
be
burn
when
they
burn
his
house
,
"
reply
the
landlord
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
believe
it
generally
understand
he
be
escape
,
have
he
not
?
<EOS>
no
trace
of
his
body
be
find
in
the
ruin
.
<EOS>
"--"None
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
he
be
escape
,
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
some
fortune
depend
upon
the
fact
;
it
would
be
mine
,
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
the
lord
keep
us
from
vampyre
and
suchlike
cattle
,
"
say
an
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
sleep
again
in
my
bed
with
any

<EOS>
It
frighten
one
out
of

of
it

<EOS>
what
a
shame
the
man

not

him

the

You

upon

pot

"
how
soon
will
the
funeral
take
place

inquire
a

at

enter
the

"
oh
!
the
town
seem
pretty
full

very
quiet

I
suppose
it
be
more
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
people
congregate
to
see
the
funeral
of
this
stranger

I

the

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
expect
anything
more
,
sir

"
say
the
landlord
;
"
for
you
see
they
must
have
have
their
swing
out
,
as
the
saying
be
,
and
be
fully
satisfied
.
<EOS>
They
can
not
have
much
more
to
do
in

exhibit
their
anger

they
all

an
old
man

a
troublesome
cough

when
do
you
ever

if
they

the

that
be
uncommonly
true

the
landlord

I
should
not

surprised

they
do
not

something
bad
than
ever

"--"Nothing
<EOS>

likely

"
say
the
little
old
man

I
can

anything

<EOS>
the
inn
be

with

several
extra

upon
the
customer

a
scene
of
bustle

activity

<EOS>
It
would
glad

landlord

though
he
be
make
of
stone

and
landlord

usually
of
much
more
malleable
material

that

however
,
the
landlord
have
hardly
time
to
congratulate
himself
,
for
the
bearer

come
now

the
undertaker
and
his
troop
of
death

follow
official

there
be
a
stir
among
the
people

who
begin
now
to

from
the
lethargy

have
come
over

the
moment

it

arrive

that

place
the
body
under
the
green
sod

against
which
so
much
of
their
anger
have
be

there
be
a
decent
silence

its
ghastly

inflict
death

any
violent
injury
upon
any

they

"
why
not
,
pray?"--"because
you
have
always
a
grin
on
your
face
as
broad
as
a
gridiron

that
be
why

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
end
the
dispute
,
for
the
employer
of
the
man
suddenly
put
his
head
in
,
saying,--
 
<EOS>
"
come
,
now
,
time

up
;
you
be
want
up
stair
,
all
of
you

we

wait

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ready
sir

"
say
the
round
man
,
take
up
his
pint
and
finish
it
off
at
a
draught
,
at
the
same
moment
he
thrust
the
remain
of
some
bread
and
cheese
into
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
Jacob
,
too
,
take
his
pot
,
and
,
have
finish
it
,
with
great
gravity
follow
the
example
of
his
more
jocose
companion
,
and
they
all
leave
the
kitchen
for
the
room
above
,
where
the
corpse
be
lie
ready
for
interment
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
unusual
bustle
;
everybody
be
on
the
tip
-
top
of
expectation
,
and
await
the
result
in
a
quiet
hurry
,
and
hope
to
have
the
first
glimpse
of
the
coffin
,
though
why
they
should
do
so
it
be
difficult
to
define
.
<EOS>
but
in
this
fit
of
mysterious
hope
and
expectation
they
certainly
stand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
they
be
long
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
a
man
at
the
door
of
one
inside,--"will
<EOS>
they
be
long
before
they
come?"--"they
be
come
now
,
"
say
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
all
keep
quiet
;
they
be
knock
their
head
against
the
top
of
the
landing
.
<EOS>
hark
!
<EOS>
there
,
I
tell
you
so
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
man
depart
,
hear
something
,
and
be
satisfied
that
he
have
get
some
information
.
 
<EOS>
"
now
,
then
,
"
say
the
landlord
,
"
move
out
of
the
way
,
and
allow
the
corpse
to
pass
out
.
<EOS>
let
me
have
no
indecent
conduct
;
let
everything
be
as
it
should
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
people
soon
remove
from
the
passage
and
vicinity
of
the
doorway
,
and
then
the
mournful
procession
--
as
the
newspaper
have
it
--
move
forward
.
<EOS>
They
be
hear
come
down
stair
,
and
thence
along
the
passage
,
until
they
come
to
the
street
,
and
then
the
whole
number
of
attendant
be
plainly
discernible
.
 
<EOS>
how
different
be
the
funeral
of
one
who
have
friend
.
<EOS>
He
be
alone
;
none
follow
,
save
the
undertaker
and
his
attendant
,
all
of
whom
look
solemn
from
habit
and
professional
motive
.
<EOS>
even
the
jocose
man
be
as
supernaturally
solemn
as
could
be
well
imagine
;
indeed
,
nobody
know
he
be
the
same
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
the
landlord
,
as
he
watch
them
down
the
street
,
as
they
slowly
pace
their
way
with
funereal
,
not
sorrowful
,
solemnity--"well
,
I
be
very
glad
that
it
be
all
over
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
have
be
a
sad
plague
to
you
,
"
say
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
have
,
indeed
;
it
must
be
to
any
one
who
have
have
another
such
a
job
as
this
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
it
out
of
any
disrespect
to
the
poor
man
who
be
dead
and
go
--
quite
the
reverse
;
but
I
would
not
have
such
another
affair
on
my
hand
for
pound
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
easily
believe
you
,
especially
when
we
come
to
consider
the
disagreeable
of
a
mob
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
say
that
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
know
what
they
will
or
will
not
do
,
confound
them
!
<EOS>
if
they
would
act
like
man
,
and
pay
for
what
they
have
,
why
,
then
I
should
not
care
much
about
them
;
but
it
do
not
do
to
have
other
people
in
the
bar
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
not
,
indeed
;
that
would
alter
the
scale
of
your
profit
,
I
reckon
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
make
all
the
difference
to
me
.
<EOS>
business
,
"
add
the
landlord
,
"
conduct
on
that
scale
,
would
become
a
loss
;
and
a
man
may
as
well
walk
into
a
well
at
once
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
have
many
such
occurrence
as
these
be
usual
in
this
part
of
the
country
?
"
inquire
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
usual
at
all

"
say
the
landlord
;
"
but
the
fact
be
,
the
whole
neighbourhood
have
run
distract
about
some
superhuman
be
<EOS>
they
call
a
vampyre
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed!"--"Yes
;
and
they
suspect
the
unfortunate
man
who
have
be

up

a
corpse

for
some
day

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh

the

have
just
take
in
the
coffin

bury

"
say
the
stranger

<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
think
perhaps
somebody
of
great
consequence
have
suddenly
become
defunct
.
<EOS>
"--"oh
,
dear
no
;
it
would
not
have
cause
half
the
sensation
;
people
have
be
really
mad

"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
strange
occurrence
,
altogether
,
I
believe
,
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
the
stranger.--"indeed
it
be
,
sir

<EOS>
I
hardly
know
the
particular
,
there
have
be
so
many
tale
afloat

though
they
all
concur
in
one
point

that

it

destroy

who

indeed

I
never

an
animal

as
a
fable

before

it
seem
to
me
extraordinary

<EOS>
"
so
it
would
do
to
any
one

as

in
the
meantime
,
the
procession
,
short
as
it
be
of
itself
,
move
along
in
slow
time
through
a
throng
of
people
who
run
out
of
their
house
on
either
side
of
the
way

line
the
whole
length
of
the
town

<EOS>
many
of
these
close
in
behind

and
follow
the
mourner
until
they
be
near
the
church

then
they
make
a
rush
to
get
into

churchyard

as

all
have
be
conduct
with
tolerable
propriety

the
funeral
meet
with
no
impediment

<EOS>
the
presence
of
death
among
so
many
of

seem
some
check
upon
the
licence

the
mob

who
bow
in

to
the
majesty
of
death

man
,
while
he
be
man

be
always
the

hatred

some
one
of

modify
state

exist
in

with
such

they

regard

it
be
barely
possible

any

in

the

proceed
along
the

by
an
immense
multitude

the

tremble

they
know
not
what
all
this
portend

<EOS>
They
think
it

pass
off

it
may
become
a
storm
first

they
hope

by
turn

there
be
a
deep
silence

by
all

those
farther
in

full

They
now
near
the

the

there
be

the
last
scene

They
be

accord

the

watch
the

full
of
earth
throw
upon
the
coffin

witness
the
ramming
down
of
the
soil
,
and
the
heaping
of
it
over
at
top
to
make
the
usual
monument

for
all
this
be
do
speedily
and
carefully
,
lest
there
should

any

the

<EOS>
the
people
be
now
somewhat
relieved

as

their

<EOS>
the
day
be
likely
to
wear
away
without

nay

even
without

a
most
extraordinary
occurrence
for

for
of

the
populace

,
perhaps
,
the
townspeople

be
extremely
pugnacious

many
be
the

thus
it

,
on

there
be

out

such

Mrs

her

the

way

no

throw

,
or
to
show
how
willing
they
be
to
do
so
if
they
know
how
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Chillingworth
,
however
,
keep
on
talk
to
the
mob
,
who
continue
shout
;
and
the
authority
anticipate
an
immediate
outbreak
of
popular
opinion
,
which
be
generally
accompany
by
some
forcible
demonstration
,
and
on
this
occasion
some
one
suggest
the
propriety
of
burn
down
Bannerworth
Hall
;
because
they
have
burn
down
the
vampyre
's
home
,
and
they
may
as
well
burn
down
that
of
the
injure
party
,
which
be
carry
by
acclamation
;
and
with
loud
shout
they
start
on
their
errand
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
mob
's
proceeding
all
over
,
and
we
regret
very
much
to
say
,
that
it
be
very
much
the
characteristic
of
english
mob
.
<EOS>
what
an
uncommonly
strange
thing
it
be
that
people
in
multitude
seem
completely
to
get
rid
of
all
reason
--
all
honour
--
all
common
ordinary
honesty
;
while
,
if
you
be
to
take
the
same
people
singly
,
you
would
find
that
they
be
reasonable
enough
,
and
would
shrink
with
a
feeling
quite
approach
to
horror
from
anything
in
the
shape
of
very
flagrant
injustice
.
 
<EOS>
this
can
only
be
account
for
by
a
piece
of
cowardice
in
the
human
race
,
which
induce
them
when
alone
,
and
act
with
the
full
responsibility
of
their
action
,
to
shrink
from
what
it
be
quite
evident
they
have
a
full
inclination
to
do
,
and
will
do
when
,
have
partially
lose
their
individuality
in
a
crowd
,
they
fancy
,
that
to
a
certain
extent
they
can
do
so
with
impunity
.
 
<EOS>
the
burning
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
's
house
,
although
it
be
one
of
those
proceeding
which
would
not
bear
the
test
of
patient
examination
,
be
yet
,
when
we
take
all
the
circumstance
into
consideration
,
an
act
really
justifiable
and
natural
in
comparison
with
the
one
which
be
now
meditate
.
 
<EOS>
Bannerworth
Hall
have
never
be
the
residence
even
of
anyone
who
have
do
the
people
any
injury
or
give
them
any
offence
,
so
that
to
let
it
become
a
prey
to
the
flame
be
but
a
gratuitous
act
of
mischief
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
,
however
,
or
seem
to
be
,
doom
,
for
all
who
have
have
any
experience
in
mob
,
must
know
how
extremely
difficult
it
be
to
withdraw
them
from
any
impulse
once
give
,
especially
when
that
impulse
,
as
in
the
present
instance
,
be
of
a
violent
character

<EOS>
"
down

Bannerworth

<EOS>
"
burn
it

burn
it

augment
by
fresh
number
each
minute
,
the
ignorant

and
,
in
many

ruffianly

soon
arrive
within

of
what

be
for
so
many
year
<EOS>
the
bane
of

Bannerworths

and
whatever
may
have
be
the
fault
of
some
of
that

those
fault

CHAPTER
LXXI
.
 
<EOS>
the
STRANGE
MEETING
<EOS>
at
the
HALL
between
MR
.
<EOS>
CHILLINGWORTH
and
the
mysterious
friend
of
VARNEY
.
  
<EOS>
[
illustration
]
 
when
we
praise
our
friend
Mr.
Chillingworth
for
not
tell
his
wife
where
he
be
go
,
in
pursuance
of
a
caution
and
a
discrimination
so
highly
creditable
to
him
,
we
be
quite
certain
that
he
have
no
such
excuse
as
regard
the
reader
.
<EOS>
therefore
we
say
at
once
that
he
have
his
own
reason
now
for
take
up
his
abode
at
Bannerworth
Hall
for
a
time
.
<EOS>
these
reason
seem
to
be
all
dependant
upon
the
fact
of
have
meet
the
mysterious
man
at
Sir
Francis
Varney
be
;
and
although
we
perhaps
would
have
hope
that
the
doctor
may
have
communicate
to
Henry
Bannerworth
all
that
he
know
and
all
that
he
surmise
,
yet
have
we
no
doubt
that
what
he
keep
to
himself
he
have
good
reason
for
so
keep
,
and
that
his
action
as
regard
it
be
found
upon
some
very
just
conclusion
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
then
make
a
determination
to
take
possession
of
,
and
remain
in
,
Bannerworth
Hall
accord
to
the
full
and
free
leave
which
the
admiral
have
give
him
so
to
do
.
<EOS>
what
result
he
anticipate
from
so
lonely
and
so
secret
a
watch
we
can
not
say
,
but
probably
they
will
soon
exhibit
themselves
.
<EOS>
It
need
no
sort
of
extraordinary
discrimination
for
any
one
to
feel
it
once
that
not
the
least
good
,
in
the
way
of
an
ambuscade
,
be
likely
to
be
effect
by
such
person
as
Admiral
Bell
or
Jack
Pringle
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
very
well
when
fighting
should
actually
ensue
,
but
they
both
be
certainly
remarkably
and
completely
deficient
in
diplomatic
skill
,
or
in
that
sort
of
patience
which
should
enable
them
at
all
to
compete
with
the
cunning
,
the
skill
,
and
the
nice
discrimination
of
such
a
man
as
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
 
<EOS>
if
anything
be
to
be
do
in
that
way
it
be
unquestionably
to
be
do
by
some
one
alone
,
who
,
like
the
doctor
,
would
,
and
could
,
remain
profoundly
quiet
and
await
the
issue
of
event
,
be
they
what
they
may
,
and
probably
remain
a
spy
and
attempt
no
overt
act
which
should
be
of
a
hostile
character
.
<EOS>
this
unquestionably
be
the
mode
,
and
perhaps
we
should
not
be
go
too
far
when
we
say
it
be
the
only
mode
which
could
be
with
anything
like
safety
rely
upon
as
one
likely
to
lead
really
to
a
discovery
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
's
motive
in
make
such
determined
exertion
to
get
possession
of
Bannerworth
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
that
night
be
doom
to
be
a
very
eventful
one
,
indeed
;
for
on
it
have
Charles
Holland
be
,
by
a
sort
of
wild
impulsive
generosity
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
rescue
from
the
miserable
dungeon
in
which
he
have
be
confine
,
and
on
that
night
,
too
,
he
,
whom
we
can
not
otherwise
describe
than
as
the
villain
Marchdale
,
have
be
,
in
consequence
of
the
evil
that
he
himself
meditate
,
and
the
crime
with
which
he
be
quite
willing
to
stain
his
soul
,
be
condemn
to
occupy
Charles
's
position
.
 
<EOS>
on
that
night
,
too
,
have
the
infuriate
mob
determine
upon
the
destruction
of
Bannerworth
Hall
,
and
on
that
night
be
Mr.
Chillingworth
wait
with
what
patience
he
could
exert
,
at
the
Hall
,
for
whatever
in
the
chapter
of
accident
may
turn
up
of
an
advantageous
character
to
that
family
in
whose
welfare
and
fortune
he
feel
so
friendly
and
so
deep
<EOS>
an
interest
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
look
,
then
,
at
the
worthy
doctor
as
he
keep
his
solitary
watch
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
,
as
have
be
the
case
when
the
admiral
share
the
place
with
him
in
the
hope
of
catch
Varney
on
that
memorable
occasion
when
he
catch
only
his
boot
,
sit
in
a
room
with
a
light
and
the
mean
and
appliance
for
make
the
night
pass
pleasantly
away
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
he
abandon
the
house
altogether
,
and
take
up
a
station
in
that
summer
-
house
which
have
be
before
mention
as
the
scene
of
a
remarkable
interview
between
Flora
Bannerworth
and
Varney
the
vampyre
.
 
<EOS>
alone
and
in
the
dark
,
so
that
he
could
not
be
probably
see
,
he
watch
that
one
window
of
the
chamber
where
the
first
appearance
of
the
hideous
vampyre
have
take
place
,
and
which
seem
ever
since
to
be
the
special
object
of
his
attack
.
 
<EOS>
by
remain
from
twilight
,
and
get
accustomed
to
the
gradually
increase
darkness
of
the
place
,
no
doubt
the
doctor
be
able
to
see
well
enough
without
the
aid
of
any
artificial
light
whether
any
one
be
in
the
place
besides
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
night
after
night
,
"
he
say
,
"
will
I
watch
here
until
I
have
succeed
in
unravel
this
mystery
;
for
that
there
be
some
fearful
and
undreamt
of
mystery
at
the
bottom
of
all
these
proceeding
I
be
well
convinced
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
when
he
make
such
a
determination
as
this
,
Dr.
Chillingworth
be
not
at
all
a
likely
man
to
break
it
,
so
there
,
look
like
a
modern
statue
in
the
arbour
,
he
sit
with
his
eye
fix
upon
the
balcony
and
the
window
of
what
use
to
be
call
Flora
's
room
for
some
hour
.
 
<EOS>
the
doctor
be
a
contemplative
man
,
and
therefore
he
do
not
so
acutely
feel
the
loneliness
of
his
position
as
many
person
would
have
do
;
moreover
,
he
be
decidedly
not
of
a
superstitious
turn
of
mind
,
although
certainly
we
can
not
deny
an
imagination
to
him
.
<EOS>
however
,
if
he
really
have
harbour
some
strange
fear
and
terror
they
would
have
be
excusable
,
when
we
consider
how
many
circumstance
have
combine
to
make
it
almost
a
matter
of
demonstration
that
Sir
Francis
Varney
be
something
more
than
mortal
.
 
<EOS>
what
quantity
of
subject
the
doctor
think
over
during
his
vigil
in
that
garden
it
be
hard
to
say
,
but
never
in
his
whole
life
,
probably
,
have
he
such
a
glorious
opportunity
for
the
most
undisturbed
contemplation
of
subject
require
deep
thought
to
analyze
,
than
as
he
have
then
.
<EOS>
at
least
he
feel
that
since
his
marriage
he
have
never
be
so
thoroughly
quiet
,
and
leave
so
completely
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
hope
that
he
succeed
in
settle
any
medical
point
of
a
knotty
character
that
may
be
hover
in
his
brain
,
and
certain
it
be
that
he
have
become
quite
absorb
in
an
abstruse
matter
connect
with
physiology
,
when
his
ear
be
startle
,
and
he
be
at
once
arouse
to
a
full
consciousness
of
where
he
be
,
and
why
he
have
come
there
,
by
the
distant
sound
of
a
man
's
footstep
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
footstep
which
seem
to
be
that
of
a
person
who
scarcely
think
it
at
all
necessary
to
use
any
caution
,
and
the
doctor
's
heart
leap
within
him
as
in
the
low
possible
whisper
<EOS>
he
say
to
himself,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
successful
--
I
be
successful
.
<EOS>
It
be
believe
now
that
the
Hall
be
desert
,
and
no
doubt
that
be
Sir
Francis
Varney
come
with
confidence
,
to
carry
out
his
object
in
so
sedulously
attack
it
,
be
that
object
what
it
may
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
elate
with
this
idea
,
the
doctor
listen
intently
to
the
advance
footstep
,
which
each
moment
sound
more
clearly
upon
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
evidently
approach
from
the
garden
entrance
towards
the
house
,
and
he
think
,
by
the
occasional
deaden
sound
of
the
person
's
foot
,
be
he
whom
he
may
,
that
he
could
not
see
his
way
very
well
,
and
,
consequently
,
frequently
stray
from
the
path
,
on
to
some
of
the
numerous
flower
-
bed
which
be
in
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
exultingly
,
"
it
must
be
Varney
;
and
now
I
have
but
to
watch
him
,
and
not
to
resist
him
;
for
what
good
on
earth
be
it
to
stop
him
in
what
he
wish
to
do
,
and
,
by
such
mean
,
never
wrest
his
secret
from
him
.
<EOS>
the
only
way
be
to
let
him
go
on
,
and
that
will
I
do
,
most
certainly
.
"
 
<EOS>
now
he
hear
the
indistinct
muttering
of
the
voice
of
some
one
,
so
low
that
he
could
not
catch
what
word
be
utter
;
but
he
fancy
that
,
in
the
deep
tone
,
he
recognise
,
without
any
doubt
,
the
voice
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
he
,
"
he
say
,
"
it
surely
must
be
he
.
<EOS>
who
else
would
come
here
to
disturb
the
solitude
of
an
empty
house
?
<EOS>
He
come
!
<EOS>
he
come
!
"
 
<EOS>
now
the
doctor
could
see
a
figure
emerge
from
behind
some
thick
beech
,
which
have
before
obstruct
his
vision
,
and
he
look
scrutinisingly
about
,
while
some
doubt
steal
slowly
over
his
mind
now
as
to
whether
it
be
the
vampyre
or
not
.
<EOS>
the
height
be
in
favour
of
the
supposition
that
it
be
none
other
than
Varney
;
but
the
figure
look
so
much
stouter
,
that
Mr.
Chillingworth
feel
a
little
staggered
upon
the
subject
,
and
unable
wholly
to
make
up
his
mind
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
pausing
of
this
visitor
,
too
,
opposite
that
window
where
Sir
Francis
Varney
have
make
his
attempt
,
be
another
strong
reason
why
the
doctor
be
incline
to
believe
it
must
be
him
,
and
yet
he
could
not
quite
make
up
his
mind
upon
the
subject
,
so
as
to
speak
with
certainty
.
 
<EOS>
a
very
short
time
,
however
,
indeed
,
must
have
suffice
to
set
such
a
question
as
that
at
rest
;
and
patience
seem
the
only
quality
of
mind
necessary
under
those
circumstance
for
Mr.
Chillingworth
to
exert
.
 
<EOS>
the
visitor
continue
gaze
either
at
that
window
,
or
at
the
whole
front
of
the
house
,
for
several
minute
,
and
then
he
turn
away
from
a
contemplation
of
it
,
and
walk
slowly
along
,
parallel
with
the
window
of
that
dining
-
room
,
one
of
which
have
be
break
so
completely
on
the
occasion
of
the
admiral
's
attempt
to
take
the
vampyre
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
the
moment
the
stranger
alter
his
position
,
from
look
at
the
window
,
and
commence
walk
away
from
it
,
Mr.
Chillingworth
's
mind
be
make
up
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
Varney
--
of
that
he
feel
now
most
positively
assure
,
and
could
have
no
doubt
whatever
upon
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
the
gait
,
the
general
air
,
the
walk
,
all
be
different
;
and
then
arise
the
anxious
question
of
who
could
it
be
that
have
intrude
upon
that
lonely
place
,
and
what
could
be
the
object
of
any
one
else
but
Varney
the
vampyre
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
the
stranger
look
a
powerful
man
,
and
walk
with
a
firm
tread
,
and
,
altogether
he
be
an
opponent
that
,
have
the
doctor
be
ever
so
belligerently
inclined
,
it
would
have
be
the
height
of
indiscretion
for
him
to
attempt
to
cope
with
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
vexatious
thing
,
too
,
for
any
one
to
come
there
at
such
a
juncture
,
perhaps
only
from
motive
of
curiosity
,
or
possibly
just
to
endeavour
to
commit
some
petty
depredation
upon
the
desert
building
,
if
possible
;
and
most
heartily
do
the
doctor
wish
that
,
in
some
way
,
he
could
scare
away
the
intruder
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
walk
along
very
slowly
,
indeed
,
and
seem
to
be
quite
take
his
time
in
make
his
observation
of
the
building
;
and
this
be
the
more
provoking
,
as
it
be
get
late
,
and
if
have
project
a
visit
at
all
,
it
would
surely
soon
be
make
,
and
then
,
when
he
find
any
one
there
,
of
course
,
he
would
go
.
 
<EOS>
amazed
beyond
expression
,
the
doctor
feel
about
on
the
ground
at
his
foot
,
until
he
find
a
tolerably
large
stone
,
which
he
throw
at
the
stranger
with
so
good
an
aim
,
that
it
hit
him
a
smart
blow
on
the
back
,
which
must
have
be
anything
but
a
pleasant
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
that
it
be
a
surprise
,
and
that
,
too
,
a
most
complete
one
,
be
evident
from
the
start
which
the
man
give
,
and
then
he
utter
a
furious
oath
,
and
rub
his
back
,
as
he
glance
about
him
to
endeavour
to
ascertain
from
whence
the
missile
have
come
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
him
again
with
that
,
"
think
the
doctor
;
"
it
may
succeed
in
scare
him
away
;
"
and
he
stoop
to
watch
for
another
stone
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
well
that
he
do
so
at
that
precise
moment
;
for
,
before
he
rise
again
,
he
hear
the
sharp
report
of
a
pistol
,
and
a
crashing
sound
among
some
of
the
old
wood
work
of
which
the
summer
-
house
be
compose
,
tell
him
that
a
shot
have
there
take
effect
.
<EOS>
affair
be
now
get
much
too
serious
;
and
,
accordingly
,
Dr.
Chillingworth
think
that
,
rather
than
stay
there
to
be
make
a
target
of
,
he
would
face
the
intruder
.
 
<EOS>
"
hold
--
hold
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
.
<EOS>
"
who
be
you
,
and
what
do
you
mean
by
that?"--"Oh
!
<EOS>
somebody
be
there
,
"
cry
the
man
,
as
he
advance
.
<EOS>
"
My
friend
,
whoever
you
be
,
you
be
very
foolish
to
throw
a
stone
at
me
.
"
 
"
and
,
my
friend
,
whoever
you
be
,
"
respond
the
doctor
,
"
you
be
very
spiteful
to
fire
a
pistol
bullet
at
me
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
"--
 
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
say
yes
;
for
,
probably
,
I
can
prove
a
right
to
be
here
,
which
you
cannot
.
<EOS>
"--"Ah
!
"
say
the
stranger
,
"
that
voice
--
why
--
you
be
Dr.
Chillingworth
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
;
but
I
do
not
know
you
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
as
he
emerge
now
from
the
summer
-
house
,
and
confront
the
stranger
who
be
within
a
few
pace
of
the
entrance
to
it
.
<EOS>
then
he
start
,
as
he
added,--
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
do
know
you
,
though
.
<EOS>
how
,
in
the
name
of
Heaven
,
come
you
here
,
and
what
purpose
have
you
in
so
come
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
purpose
have
you
?
<EOS>
since
we
meet
at
Varney
's
,
I
have
be
make
some
inquiry
about
this
neighbourhood
,
and
learn
strange
thing
.
<EOS>
"--"That
<EOS>
you
may
very
easily
do
here

what

more
extraordinary
,
the
strange

be
,
for
the
most
part
<EOS>
,
I
can
assure
you

quite
true
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
reader
will
,
from
what
have
be
say
,
now
readily
recognise
this
man
as
Sir
Francis
Varney
's
mysterious
visitor
,
to
whom
he
give
,
from
some
hide
cause
or
another
,
so
large
a
sum
of
money
,
and
between
whom
and
Dr.
Chillingworth
a
mutual
recognition
have
take
place
,
on
the
occasion
when
Sir
Francis
Varney
have
,
with
such
cool
assurance
,
invite
the
admiral
to
breakfast
with
him
at
his
new
abode
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
,
however

the
man

<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
,
be
fully
qualified
to
tell
me
of
more
than
I
have
be
able
to
learn
from
other
people
;
and
,
first
of
all
,
let
me
ask
you
why
you
be
here?"--"before
<EOS>
I
answer
you
that
question

any
other

"
say
the
doctor
,
"
let
me
beg
of
you
to
tell
me
truly
,
be
Sir
Francis
Varney--
"
 
<EOS>
the
doctor
whisper
in
the
ear
of
the
stranger
some
name
,
as
if
he
fear
,
even
there
,
in
the
silence
of
that
garden
,
where
everything
conspire
to
convince
him
that
he
could
not
be
overhear
,
to
pronounce
it
in
an
audible
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
be

the
other.--"You
have
no
manner
of
doubt
of
it

<EOS>

doubt?--certainly
not
.
<EOS>
what
doubt
can
I
have
?
<EOS>
I
know
it
for
a
positive
certainty
,
and
he
know
,
of
course
,
that
I
do
know
it
,
and
have
purchase
my
silence
pretty
handsomely
,
although
I
must
confess
that
nothing
but
my
positive
necessity
would
have
induce
me
to
make
the
large
demand
upon
him
that
I
have
,
and
I
hope
soon
to
be
able
to
release
him
altogether
from
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
doctor
shake
his
head
repeatedly
,
as
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
suspect
it
;
I
suspect
it
,
do
you
know

from
the
first

that
I

you
there
in

haunt
me

awfully

yet
,

I
feel
certain
that
I
have
once
see
it
under
strange
circumstance

I
could
not
identify
it
with

no

no
matter

here
for
him

indeed!"--"ay

that
I

I
fling
a
stone
at
you

not

with
hope
that
you
would
be
,
by
such
mean
,
perhaps
,
scare
away
,
and
so
leave
the
coast
clear
for
him
.

"
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
have
an
appointment
with
him?"--"By
no

he

determined
attack
upon

compel
to
leave

be
his
object

<EOS>

cry
the

energetically--"can
you

me

assure
you

peace

You
say
you
have
make
inquiry
about
this
neighbourhood

,
if
you
have
do
so
,
you
have
discover
how
the
family
of

bannerworth
have
be
persecute
by
Varney

how

in
particular

intelligent

have
be
most
cruelly
make
to
suffer

"
 
<EOS>

I
have
hear
all
that
,
and
I
dare
say
with
many
exaggeration
.
<EOS>
"--"It
would
be
difficult
for
any
one
really
to
exaggerate
the
horror

have
take
place

that
any
information
which
you
can
give
respect
the
motive
of
Varney
will
tend
,
probably
,
to
restore
peace
to
those
who
have
be
so
cruelly
persecute

be
an
act

kindness

vile
;

<EOS>
there
be
a
silence
of
some
moment

duration

then
the
stranger
speak
in
a
tone
of
voice

look
as

with
some
emotion

"
You
will
find
that
the
time
which
elapse
since
I
last
see
you
in
London
,
to
have
be
spend
in
an
eventful
,
varied
manner
.
<EOS>
"--"You
be
in
good
circumstance
then
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth.--"I
be
,
but
many
event
happen
after
that
which
alter
the
prospect
;
make
it
even
more
gloomy
than
you
can
well
imagine
:
but
I
will
tell
you
all
candidly
,
and
you
can
keep
watch
upon
Bannerworth
Hall
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
You
be
well
aware
that
I
be
well
to
do
,
and
have
ample
fund
,
and
inclination
to
spend
them

"--"I

recollect
:

you
be
married

surely?"--"I
be

"

the

,
sadly
,

I
be
married
then

"--"And
now?"--"i
be

<EOS>
the
stranger
seem
much
moved
,

,
after
a
moment

so
,
he
resumed--"I
be
a
widower
now
;

how
that
event
come
about
be
partly
my
purpose
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
marry
long

that
be
very
long

for
I
have

one
child
,

she
be
not
old

of
an
age
to
know
much
more
than
what
she
may
be

she
be
still
in
the
course

<EOS>
I
be
early
addict
to
gamble
;
the
dice
have
its
charm
,
as
all
those
who
have
ever
engage
in
play

too
well
know
;
it
be
perfectly
fascinating

<EOS>
"--"so
<EOS>
I
have
hear
,

Mr.

though
,
for
myself
,
I
find
a
wife

professional
pursuit
quite
incompatible

pleasure

be
never
at

come
what
would

never

<EOS>
I
should
say
he
do
,

yet
he
never
lose

much

often

You

spend
his

along

through

the

almost
impossible

into

brilliancy
of

walk
about

look
on

man
engage

not
understand

I

what
to
attempt

where
to
go

<EOS>
one
or
two
person
come
up

ask
me
if

ill

My
answer
be
,
that
I
be
well
enough
.
<EOS>
good
God
!
<EOS>
how
far
from
the
truth
be
that
;

I
find
I
must
place
more
control
on
my
feeling
,
else
I
should
cause
much
conversation
,
and
then
I
should
lose
all
hope
of
recover
myself
,
and
all
prospect
of
living
,
even
.
 
<EOS>
"
at
length
some
one
do
come
in
,
and
I
remark
I
have
be
there
all
the
evening
and
have
not
play
.
<EOS>
I
have
an
invitation
to
play
with
him
,
which
end
,
by
a
little
sleight
of
hand
,
in
my
favour
;
and
on
that
I
have
calculate
as
much
as
on
any
good
fortune
I
may
meet
.
<EOS>
the
person
I
play
with
observe
it
not
,
and
,
when
we
leave
off
playing
,
I
have
some
six
or
seven
pound
in
pocket
.
<EOS>
this
,
to
me
,
be
a
very
great
sum
;
and
,
the
moment
I
could
decently
withdraw
myself
,
I
run
off
home
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
fearful
of
the
scene
that
await
me

<EOS>
I
expect
something
;
bad
than
I
have
yet
see
.
<EOS>
possibly
Lizzy
may
be
angry
,
and
scold
as
well
as
complain
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
tap
at
the
door
gently
,
but
hear
no
one
answer
;
but
of
this
I
take
no
notice
,
as
I
believe
that
they
may
be
,
and
be
,
most
probably
,
fast
asleep
.
<EOS>
I
have
provide
myself
with
a

I
therefore
open
the
door

I
look
on

I
go
on

at

some
misgiving
overtook
me
.
<EOS>
I
tremble
much

She
lie
on
the
bed

with
her
back
towards
the
spot

come
towards

My

violently

She

no

I
then
place
my

upon

<EOS>
It
be
enough
,
and
I
start
back
in
great
horror
.
<EOS>
She
be
dead

this

horror
itself

I
stagger
back

fall
into

place
down

Heaven

there

him,--

sir

consider
,
too
,
that
in
hold
such
a
humiliating
situation
that
I
be
justly
serve
for
the
barbarity
of
which
I
have
be
guilty

what
can

cruelty

which

anything?"--

yes

nearer

one

through

orifice

back
of
the
summer
-
house

it
will
be
recollect

damage

doctor

companion
recognise

strange

haggard
feature

now

confront
them

be
a
pause

surprise

moment

two

on
the
part

Sir

frequently

dispossess

dismay

implore
you
now

not
in

oppress

you
may

blacker

cruel
persecution

aloud

justice

that
he
rather
seem
to
throw
himself
bodily
at
the
fence

which
separate
it

to

guilty
of
the
baseness

her

<EOS>
"
hark
you
,
Mr.
Holland
,
I
have
quite
make
up
my
mind
that
I
will
not
leave
Bannerworth
Hall
yet
;
but
you
can
go
alone
,
and
easily
find
them
by
the
direction
which
I
will
give
you
;
only
let
me
beg
of
you
not
to
go
abruptly
into
the
presence
of
Flora
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
an
extremely
delicate
state
of
health
,
and
although
I
do
not
take
upon
myself
to
say
that
a
shock
of
a
pleasurable
nature
would
prove
of
any
paramount
bad
consequence
to
her
,
yet
it
be
as
well
not
to
risk
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
most
careful
,
you
may
depend
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
this
moment
there
be
a
loud
ringing
at
the
garden
bell
,
and
,
when
it
be
answer
by
one
of
the
dragoon
,
who
be
order
to
do
so
by
his
officer
,
he
come
back
,
escort
no
other
than
Jack
Pringle
,
who
have
be
send
by
the
admiral
to
the
Hall

who
have
solace
himself
so
much
on
the
road
with
diver
potation
,
that
he
do
not
reach
it
till
now
,
which
be
a
full
hour
after
the
reasonable
time
in

he
ought

the
distance

Jack
be
not

dumb

he
have
have
enough
to
give
him
a

jolly

of
feeling
of
independence

so
he

back

the

thing
you
ought

do

be
to
report
yourself
as
have
come
aboard

<EOS>
follow
me
,
and
I
will
soon
show
yer
the
port
where
the
old

lay
hisself
up

"
 
<EOS>
Jack
walk
on
first
,
tolerably
steady
,
if
one
may
take
into
account
his
diver
deep
potation
,
and
Charles
Holland
,
anticipate
with
delight
again
look
upon
the
face
of
his
much
love
Flora
,
follow
closely
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
We
can
well
imagine
the
world
of
delightful
thought
that
come
crowd
upon
him
when
Jack
,
after
rather
a
long
walk
,
announce
that
they
be
now
very
near
the
residence
of
the
object
of
his
soul
's
adoration
.
 
<EOS>
We
trust
that
there
be
not
one
of
our
reader
who
,
for
one
moment
,
will
suppose
that
Charles
Holland
be
the
sort
of
man
to
leave
even
such
a
villain
and
double
-
faced
hypocrite
as
Marchdale
,
to
starve
amid
the
gloomy
ruin
where
he
be
immure
.
 
<EOS>
far
from
Charles
's
intention
be
any
such
thing
;
but
he
do
think
that
a
night
pass
there
,
with
no
other
company
than
his
own
reflection
,
would
do
him
a
world
of
good
,
and
be
,
at
all
event
,
no
very
great
modicum
of
punishment
for
the
rascality
with
which
he
have
behave
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
even
during
that
night
there
be
refreshment
in
the
shape
of
bread
and
water
,
such
as
have
be
present
to
Charles
himself
,
within
Marchdale
's
reach
as
they
have
be
within
his
.
 
<EOS>
that
individual
now
,
Charles
think
,
would
have
a
good
opportunity
of
test
the
quality
of
that
kind
of
food
,
and
of
find
out
what
an
extremely
light
diet
it
be
for
a
strong
man
to
live
upon
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
the
morning
it
be
Charles
's
intention
to
take
Henry
Bannerworth
and
the
admiral
with
him
to
the
ruin
,
and
<EOS>
then
and
there
release
the
wretch
from
his
confinement
,
on
condition
that
he
make
a
full
confession
of
his
villanie
before
those
person
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
how
gladly
would
Marchdale
have
exchange
the
fate
which
actually
befall
him
for
any
amount
of
personal
humiliation
,
always
provide
that
it
bring
with
it
a
commensurate
amount
of
personal
safety
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
fate
be
one
altogether
undreamt
of
by
Charles
Holland
,
and
wholly
without
his
control
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
fate
which
would
have
be
his
,
but
for
the
murderous
purpose
which
have
bring
Marchdale
to
the
dungeon
,
and
those
happy
accident
which
have
enable
Charles
to
change
place
with
him
,
and
breathe
the
free
,
cool
,
fresh
air
;
while
he
leave
his
enemy
load
with
the
same
chain
that
have
encumber
his
limb
so
cruelly
,
and
lie
on
that
same
damp
dungeon
floor
,
which
he
think
would
be
his
grave
.
 
<EOS>
We
mention
that
as
Charles
leave
the
ruin
,
the
storm
,
which
have
be
give
various
indication
of
its
come
,
seem
to
be
rapidly
approach
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
these
extremely
local
tempest
which
expend
all
their
principal
fury
over
a
small
space
of
country
;
and
,
in
this
instance
,
the
space
seem
to
include
little
more
than
the
river
,
and
the
few
meadow
which
immediately
surround
it
,
and
lend
it
so
much
of
its
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
Marchdale
soon
find
that
his
cry
be
drown
by
the
loud
voice
of
the
element
.
<EOS>
the
wailing
of
the
wind
among
the
ancient
ruin
be
much
more
full
of
sound
than
his
cry
;
and
,
now
and
then
,
the
full
-
mouthed
thunder
fill
the
air
with
such
a
volume
of
roaring
,
and
awaken
so
many
echo
among
the
ruin
,
that
,
have
he
possess
the
voice
of
fifty
man
,
he
could
not
have
hope
to
wage
war
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
although
we
know
that
Charles
Holland
would
have
encounter
death
himself
,
rather
than
he
would
have
willingly
leave
anything
human
to
expire
of
hunger
in
that
dungeon
,
yet
Marchdale
,
judging
of
other
by
himself
,
feel
by
no
means
sure
of
any
such
thing
,
and
,
in
his
horror
of
apprehension
,
fancy
that
that
be
just
the
sort
of
easy
,
and
pleasant
,
and
complete
revenge
that
it
be
in
Charles
Holland
's
power
to
take
,
and
just
the
one
which
would
suggest
itself
,
under
the
circumstance
,
to
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Could
anything
be
possibly
more
full
of
horror
than
such
a
thought
?
<EOS>
death
,
let
it
come
in
any
shape
it
may
,
be
yet
a
most
repulsive
and
unwelcome
guest
;
but
,
when
it
come
,
so
united
with
all
that
can
add
to
its
terror
,
it
be
enough
to
drive
reason
from
its
throne
,
and
fill
the
mind
with
image
of
absolute
horror
.
 
<EOS>
tired
of
shriek
,
for
his
parch
lip
and
clog
tongue
would
scarcely
now
permit
him
to

to
the
furious
storm
without

in
the
last
abandonment
of
despair

here

alone

all
alone

starvation
to
creep
on
me
by
degree

life

energy
one
by

already
do
I
feel
the
dreadful
sickening

on
me

help
me
<EOS>
Heav

<EOS>
no

be
there
no
fiend
of
darkness
who
now
will
bid
me
a
price
for
a
human
soul

be
there
not
one

will
do
so

rescue
me
from
the
horror
that
surround

I
dare
not

mercy
there

"
 
<EOS>
the
storm
continue
louder
and
louder
.
<EOS>
the
wind
,
it
be
true
,
be
nearly
hush
,
but
the
roar
and
the
rattle
of
the
echo
-
awaken
thunder
fully
make
up
for
its
cessation
,
while
,
now
and
then
,
even
there
,
in
that
underground
abode
,
some
sudden
reflection
of
the
vivid
lightning
's
light
would
find
its
way
,
lending
,
for
a
fleeting
moment
,
sufficient
light
to
Marchdale
,
wherewith
he
could
see
the
gloomy
place
in
which
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
at
time
he
weep
,
and
at
time
he
rave
,
while
ever
and
anon
he
make
such
frantic
effort
to
free
himself
from
the
chain
that
be
around
him
,
that
,
have
they
not
be
strong
,
he
must
have
succeed
;
but
,
as
it
be
,
he
only
make
deep
indentation
into
his
flesh
,
and
give
himself
much
pain
.
 
<EOS>
"
Charles
Holland
!
"
<EOS>
he
shout
;
"
oh
!
release
me
!

Varney

<EOS>
Varney
!
<EOS>
why
do
you
not
come
to
save
me
?
<EOS>
I
have
toil
for
you
most
unrequitedly
--
I
have
not
have
my
reward
.
<EOS>
let
it
all
consist
in
my
release
from
this
dreadful
bondage
.
<EOS>
help
!
<EOS>
help
!
<EOS>
oh
,
help
!
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
one
to
hear
him
.
<EOS>
the
storm
continue
,
and
now
,
suddenly
,
a
sudden
and
a
sharp
sound
than
any
awaken
by
the
thunder
's
roar
come
upon
his
startled
ear
,
and
,
in
increase
agony
<EOS>
,
he
shouted,--
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
?
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
what
be
that
?
<EOS>
God
of
heaven
,
do
my
fear
translate
that
sound
aright
?
<EOS>
Can
it
be
,
oh
!
<EOS>
can
it
be
,
that
the
ruin
which
have
stand
for
so
many
a
year
be
now
crumble
down
before
the
storm
of
to
-
night
?
"
 
<EOS>
the
sound
come
again
,
and
he
feel
the
wall
of
the
dungeon
in
which
he
be
shake
.
<EOS>
now
there
could
be
no
doubt
but
that
the
lightning
have
strike
some
part
of
the
building
,
and
so
endanger
the
safety
of
all
that
be
above
ground
.
<EOS>
for
a
moment
there
come
across
his
brain
such
a
rush
of
agony
,
that
he
neither
speak
nor
move
.
<EOS>
have
that
dreadful
feeling
continue
much
longer
,
he
must
have
lapse
into
insanity
;
but
that
amount
of
mercy
--
for
mercy
it
would
have
be
--
be
not
show
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
still
feel
all
the
accumulate
horror
of
his
situation
,
and
then
,
with
such
shriek
as
nothing
but
a
full
appreciation
of
such
horror
could
have
give
him
strength
to
utter
,
he
call
upon
earth
,
upon
heaven
and
upon
all
that
be
infernal
,
to
save
him
from
his
impending
doom
.
 
<EOS>
all
be
in
vain
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
impending
doom
which
nothing
but
the
direct
interposition
of
Heaven
could
have
at
all
avert
;
and
it
be
not
likely
that
any
such
perversion
of
the
regular
law
of
nature
would
take
place
to
save
such
a
man
as
Marchdale
.
 
<EOS>
again
come
the
crash
sound
of
fall
stone
,
and
he
be
certain
that
the
old
ruin
,
which
have
stand
for
so
many
hundred
year
the
storm
,
and
the
utmost
wrath
of
the
element
,
be
at
length
yield
,
and
crumble
down
.
 
<EOS>
what
else
could
he
expect
but
to
be
engulphe
among
the
fragment
--
fragment
still
weighty
and
destructive
,
although
in
decay
.
<EOS>
how
fearfully
now
do
his
horrified
imagination
take
in
at
one
glance
,
as
it
be
,
a
panoramic
view
of
all
his
past
life
,
and
how
absolutely
contemptible
,
at
that
moment
,
appear
all
that
he
have
be
strive
for
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
wall
shake
again
,
and
this
time
the
vibration
be
more
fearful
than
before
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
tremendous
uproar
above
him
--
the
roof
yield
to
some
superincumbent
pressure
--
there
be
one
shriek
,
and
Marchdale
lie
crush
beneath
a
mass
of
masonry
that
it
would
take
man
and
machinery
day
to
remove
from
off
him
.
 
<EOS>
all
be
over
now
.
<EOS>
that
bold
,
bad
man
--
that
accomplish
hypocrite
--
<EOS>
that
mendacious
,
would
-
be
murderer
be
no
more
.
<EOS>
He
lie
but
a
mangled
,
crush
,
and
fester
corpse
.
 
<EOS>
May
his
soul
find
mercy
with
his
God
!
 
<EOS>
the
storm
,
from
this
moment
,
seem
to
relax
in
its
violence
,
as
if
it
have
accomplish
a
great
purpose
,
and
,
consequently
,
now
,
need
no
longer
"
vex
the
air
with
its
boisterous
presence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
gradually
the
thunder
die
away
in
the
distance
.
<EOS>
the
wind
no
longer
blow
in
blustrous
gust
,
but
,
with
a
gentle
murmuring
,
sweep
around
the
ancient
pile
,
as
if
singe
the
requiem
of
the
dead
that
lie
beneath

that
dead
which
mortal
eye
be
never
to
look

[

]
 
<EOS>
Charles
Holland
follow
Jack
Pringle
for
some
time
in
silence
from
Bannerworth
Hall
;
his
mind
be
too
full
of
thought
concern
the
past
to
allow
him
to
indulge
in
much
of
that
kind
of
conversation
in
which
Jack
Pringle
may
be
fully
consider
to
be
a
proficient
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
Jack
,
somehow
or
another
,
he
have
feel
his
dignity
offend
in
the
garden
of
Bannerworth
Hall
,
and
he
have
make
up
his
mind
,
as
he
afterwards
state
in
his
own
phraseology
,
not
to
speak
to
nobody
till
somebody
speak
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
a
grow
anxiety
,
however
,
to
ascertain
from
one
who
have
see
her
lately
,
how
Flora
have
bear
his
absence
,
at
length
induce
Charles
Holland
to
break
his
self
-
impose
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
,
"
he
say
,
"
you
have
have
the
happiness
of
see
her
lately
,
tell
me
,
do
Flora
Bannerworth
look
as
she
be
will
not
to
look
,
or
have
all
the
rose
fade
from
her
cheek
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
as
for
the
rose
,
"
say
Jack
,
"
I
be
blow
if
I
can
tell
,
and
see
as
how
she
do
not
look
at
me
much
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
know
nothing
about
her
;
I
can
tell
you
something
,
though
,
about
the
old
admiral
that
will
make
you
open
your
eye
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
Jack
,
and
what
may
that
be
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
he
be
take
to
drink
,
and
get
groggy
about
every
day
of
his
life
,
and
the
most
singular
thing
be
,
that
when
that
be
the
case
with
the
old
man
,
he
say
it
be
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
Jack
!
<EOS>
take
to
drinking
have
my
poor
old
uncle
,
from
grief
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
Jack
,
at
my
disappearance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
do
not
think
it
be
grief
,
"
say
Jack
;
"
it
strike
me
<EOS>
it
be
rum
-
and
-
water
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
alas
,
alas
,
I
never
could
have
imagine
he
could
have
fall
into
that
habit
of
yours
;
he
always
seem
so
far
from
anything
of
this
kind
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
,
sir
,
"
say
Jack
,
"
I
<EOS>
know'd
<EOS>
you
would
be
astonish
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
the
death
of
him
,
that
be
my
opinion
;
and
the
idea
,
you
know
,
Master
Charles
,
of
accuse
me
when
he
get
drunk
himself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
that
be
a
common
delusion
of
intemperate
person
,
"
say
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
it
,
sir
;
well
,
it
be
a
very
awkward
I
thing
,
because
you
know
,
sir
,
as
well
as
most
people
,
that
I
be
not
the
fellow
to
take
a
drop
too
much
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
,
Jack
,
that
I
know
so
much
,
for
I
have
certainly
hear
my
uncle
accuse
you
of
intoxication
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Lor
'
,
sir
,
that
be
all
just
on
account
of
his
try
it
hisself
;
he
be
a
thinking
on
it
then
,
and
want
to
see
how
I
would
take
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
tell
me
of
Flora
;
be
you
quite
certain
that
she
have
have
no
more
alarm
from
Varney
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
,
that
ere
vampyre
fellow
?
<EOS>
not
a
bit
of
it
,
your
honour
.
<EOS>
Lor
'
bless
you
<EOS>
,
he
must
have
find
out
by
some
mean
or
another
that
I
be
on
the
look
out
,
and
that
do
the
business
.
<EOS>
He
will
never
come
near
Miss
Flora
again
,
I
will
be
bind
,
though
to
be
sure
we
move
away
from
the
Hall
on
account
of
him
;
but
not
that
I
see
the
good
of
cruise
out
of
one
's
own
latitude
,
but
somehow
or
another
you
see
the
doctor
and
the
admiral
get
it
into
their
head
to
establish
a
sort
of
blockade
,
and
the
idea
of
the
thing
be
to
sail
away
in
the
night
quite
quiet
,
and
after
that
take
up
a
position
that
would
come
across
the
enemy
on
the
larboard
tack
,
if
so
be
as
he
make
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
you
allude
to
watch
the
Hall
,
I
presume
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
,
sir
,
just
so
;
but
<EOS>
would
you
believe
it
,
Master
Charlie
,
the
admiral
and
the
doctor
get
so
bless
drunk
that
I
could
do
nothing
with
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
they
do
indeed
,
and
make
all
kind
of
queer
mistake
,
so
that
the
end
of
all
that
be
,
that
the
vampyre
do
come
;
but
he
get
away
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
do
come
then
;
Sir
Francis
Varney
come
again
after
the
house
be
presume
to
be
desert
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
do
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
very
strange
;
what
on
earth
could
have
be
his
object
?
<EOS>
this
affair
be
most
inexplicably
mysterious
.
<EOS>
I
hope
the
distance
,
Jack
,
be
not
far
that
you
be
take
me
,
for
I
be
incapable
of
endure
much
fatigue
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
a
great
way
,
your
honour
;
keep
two
point
to
the
westward
,
and
sail
straight
on
;
we
will
soon
come
to
port
.
<EOS>
My
eye
,
will
not
there
be
a
squall
when
you
get
in
.
<EOS>
I
expect
as
Miss
Flora
will
drop
down
as
dead
as
a
herring
,
for
she
do
not
think
you
be
above
the
hatch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
good
thought
,
Jack
;
my
sudden
appearance
may
produce
alarm
.
<EOS>
when
we
reach
the
place
of
abode
of
the
Bannerworths
,
you
shall
precede
me
,
and
prepare
them
in
some
measure
for
my
reception
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
good
,
sir
;
do
you
see
that
there
little
white
cottage
a

head
,
there
in
the
offing

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
;
be
that
the
place
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
your
honour

that
be
the
port
to
which
we
be
bind
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
Jack
,
you
hasten
a
-
head
,
and
see
Miss
Flora
,
and
be
sure
you
prepare
her
gently
and
by
degree
,
you
know
,
Jack
,
for
my
appearance
,
so
that
she
shall
not
be
alarm
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
,
sir
,
I
understand
;
you
wait
here
,
and
I
will
go
and
do
it
;
there
would
be
a
squall
if
you
be
to
make
your
appearance
,
sir
,
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
She
look
upon
you
as
safely
lodge
in
Davy
's
locker
;
she
mind
me
,
all
the
world
,
of
a
girl
I
know
at
Portsmouth
,
call
Bet
Bumplush
.
<EOS>
She
be
one
of
your
delicate
little
creature
as
do
not
live
long
in
this
here

no

blow
me

when
I
come
home
from
a
eighteen
month

cruise

once
I
seed
her
drinking
rum
out
of
a
quart
pot
,
so
I
say
,
'
Hilloa
,
what
cheer
?
'
<EOS>
and
only
to
think
now
of
the
wonderful
effect
that
there
have
upon
her
;
with
that
very
pot
she
give
the
fellow
as
be
stand
treat
a
knobber
on
the
head
as
last
him
three
week

<EOS>
She
be
too
good
for
this
here
world

she
be
,
and
too
rummantic

Jack

and
away
he
walk
towards
the
cottage
,
leave
Charles
some
distance
behind
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
and
the
admiral
be
sit
together
converse
.
<EOS>
the
old
man
,
who
love
her
as
if
she
have
be
a
child
of
his
own

be
endeavour
,
to
the
extent
of
his
ability

to
assuage
the
anguish
of
her
thought
,
which
at
that
moment
chance
to
be
bent
upon
Charles
Holland

"
Nevermind

he
say
;

he
will
turn
up
some
of

I
sha'n't

to
tell
him

how

you
for

Charles

<EOS>
They
carry
,
sir

upon
the

of
them
their
own
refutation

I
be
only
surprised
that
for

any

know
him

could
have
believe
him

will
do

I

Jack
walk
into

about

in
silence

thrust
his

in

away

go
out

and
now
those
two
love
heart
be
alone
--
they
who
have
be
so
long
separate
by
malignant
destiny
,
once
again
be
heart
to
heart
,
look
into
each
other
's
face
with
all
the
beam
tenderness
of
an
affection
of
the
true
,
holy
character

<EOS>
the
admiral
have
do
a
favour
to
them
both
to
leave
them
alone
,
although
we
much
doubt
whether
his
presence
,
or
the
presence
of
the
whole
world
,
would
have
have
the
effect
of
control
one
generous
sentiment
of
noble
feeling

They
would
have
forget
everything

that
they
be
together
,

that
once
again
each
look
into
the
other

eye
with
all
the
tenderness
of
a
love
purer
and
high
than
ordinarily
belong
to
mortal
affection
.
 
<EOS>
Language
be
weak
to
give
utterance
to
the
full
gust
of
happy
feeling
that
now
be
theirs
.
<EOS>
It
be
ecstasy
enough
to
feel
,
to
know
that
the
evil
fortune
which
have
so
long
separate
them
,
deprive
each
existence
of
its
sunny
aspect
,
be
over

<EOS>
It
be
enough
for
Charles
Holland
to
feel
that
she
love
him
still
.
<EOS>
It
be
enough
for
Flora
Bannerworth
to
know
,
as
she
look
into
his
beam
countenance
,
that
that
love
be
not
misplace
,
but
be
meet
by
feeling
such
as
she
herself
would
have
dictate
to
be
the
inhabitant
of
the
heart
of
him
whom
she
would
have
choose
from
the
mass
of
mankind
as
her
own

I
be

your

"

"
ah

Charles

you
ought

have
know

better

<EOS>
I
stand
amid
sore
temptation
to
do
so
much
.
<EOS>
there
be
those
who
would
have
urge
me
on
to
think
that
you
have
cast

there

place
the
bad

upon
your
conduct

with
a
devilish
ingenuity
to
strive
to
make
me
participate
in
such
a
feeling
;

,
no
,
Charles
,
no
--
<EOS>
I
love
you

I
trust
you

I
could
not
so
far
belie
my
own
judgment

to
tell
you
other
than
what
you
always
seem
to
my
young
fancy

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
you
be
right
,
my
Flora
,
right
;
and
be
it
not
a
glorious
triumph
to
see
that
love
--
that
sentiment
of
passion
--
have
enable
you
to
have
so
enduring
and
so
noble
a
confidence
in
aught
human

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
Charles
,
it
be
the
sentiment
of
passion
,
for
our
love
have
be
more
a
sentiment
than
a
passion
.
<EOS>
I
would
fain
think
that
we
have
love
each
other
with
an
affection
not
usually
know
,
appreciate
,
or
understand
,
and
so
,
in
the
vanity
of
my
good
affection
,
I
would
strive
to
think
them
something
exclusive
,
and
beyond
the
common
feeling
of
humanity

<EOS>
"
and
you
be
right
,
my
Flora

such
love
as
yours
be
the
exception
;
there
may
be
preference
,
there
may
be
passion

and
there
may
be
sentiment

never

never

surely
,
be
there
a
heart
like
your

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Charles
,
now
you
speak
from
a
too
poetical
fancy
;
but
be
it
possible
that
I
have
have
you
here
so
long
,
with
your
hand
clasp
in
mine
,
and
ask
you
not
the
cause
of
your
absence
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Flora
,
I
have
suffer
much
--
much
physically
,
but
more
mentally
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
thought
of
you
that
be
at
once
the
bane
and
the
antidote
of
my
existence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
Charles
!
<EOS>
do
I
present
myself
in
such
contradictory
colour
to
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
dear
,
as
thus
.
<EOS>
when
I
think
of
you
,
sometimes
,
in
the
deep
seclusion
of
a
dungeon
,
that
think
almost
goad
me
to
madness
,
because
it
bring
with
it
the
conviction
--
a
conviction
peculiar
to
a
lover
--
that
none
could
so
effectually
stand
between
you
and
all
evil
as
myself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
Charles
;
most
true
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
seem
to
me
as
if
all
the
world
in
arm
could
not
have
protect
you
so
well
as
this
one
heart
,
clothe
in
the
triple
steel
of
its
affection
,
could
have
shield
you
from
evil
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
Charles
;
and
<EOS>
then
I
be
the
bane
of
your
existence
,
because
I
fill
you
with
apprehension
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
for
a
time
,
dear
;
and
then
come
the
antidote
;
for
when
exhaust
alike
in
mind
and
body
--
when
lie
helpless
,
with
chain
upon
my
limb
--
when
expect
death
at
every
visit
of
those
who
have
drag
me
from
light
and
from
liberty
,
and
from
love
;
it
be
<EOS>
but
the
thought
of
thy
beauty
and
thy
affection
that
nerve
me
,
and
give
me
a
hope
even
amidst
the
cruell
disaster
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
then
--
and
then
,
Charles
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
my
blessing
,
as
you
have
ever

as
you

as
you
will
ever
be

my
own
Flora

my
beautiful
--
my
true
!
"
 
<EOS>
We
will
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
it
be
the
fact
;
but
,
from
a
series
of
singular
sound
which
reach
even
to
the
passage
of
the
cottage
,
we
have
our
own
private
opinion
to
the
effect
,
that
Charles
begin
kiss
Flora
at
the
top
of
her
forehead
,
and
never
stop
,
somehow
or
another
,
till
he
get
down
to
her
chin
--
no
,
not
her
chin
--
her
sweet
lip
<EOS>
--
he
could
not
get
past
them
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
wrong
;
but
we
can
not
help
it
--
we
be
faithful
chronicler
.
<EOS>
reader
,
if
you
be
of
the
sterner
sex

what
would
you
have
done?--if

what
would
you
have

MUTUAL
EXPLANATIONS
,
and
the
VISIT
to
the
ruin

<EOS>
[
illustration
]
 
during
the
next
hour
,
Charles
inform
Flora
of
the
whole
particular
of
his
forcible
abduction
;
and
to
his
surprise
he
hear
,
of
course
,
for
the
first
time
,
of
those
letter
,
purport
to
be
write
by
him
,
which
endeavour
to
give
so
bad
an
aspect
to
the
fact
of
his
sudden
disappearance
from
Bannerworth
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
would
insist
upon
the
admiral
,
Henry
,
and
the
rest
of
the
family
,
hear
all
that
Charles
have
to
relate
concern
Mr.
Marchdale
;
for
well
she
know
that
her
mother
,
from
early
association
,
be
so
far
impressed
in
the
favour
of
that
hypocritical
personage
,
that
nothing
but
damn
fact
,
much
to
his
prejudice
,
would
suffice
to
convince
her
of
the
character
he
really
be
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
open
to
conviction
,
and
<EOS>
when
she
really
find
what
a
villain
she
have
cherish
and
give
her
confidence
to
,
she
shed
abundance
of
tear
,
and
blame
herself
exceedingly
as
the
cause
of
some
of
the
misfortune
which
have
fall
upon
her
child
.
 
<EOS>
"
very
good
,
"
say
the
admiral
;
"
I
be
not
surprise
a
bit
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
be
a
vagabond
from
the
first
time
I
clap
eye
upon
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
down
look
about
the
fellow
's
figure
-
head
that
I
do
not
like
,
and
be
hang
to
him
,
but
I
never
think
he
would
have
go
the
length
he
have
do
.
<EOS>
and
so
you
say
you
have
get
him
safe
in
the
ruin
,
Charles
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
indeed
,
uncle
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
then
there
let
him
remain
,
and
a
good
place
,
too
,
for
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
uncle
,
no
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
speak
without
thought
.
<EOS>
I
intend
to
release
him
in
a
few
hour
,
when
I
have
rest
from
my
fatigue
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
come
to
any
harm
if
he
be
to
go
without
food
entirely
for
the
time
that
I
leave
him
;
but
even
that
he
will
not
do
,
for
there
be
bread
and
water
in
the
dungeon
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
bread
and
water
!
<EOS>
that
be
too
good
for
him
.
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
Charles
,
when
you
go
to
let
him
out
,
I
will
go
with
you
,
just
to
tell
him
what
I
think
of
him
,
the
vagabond
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
must
suffer
amazingly
,
for
no
doubt
know
well
,
as
he
do
,
his
own
infamous
intention
,
he
will
consider
that
if
I
be
to
leave
him
to
starve
to
death
,
I
should
be
but
retail
upon
him
the
injury
he
would
have
inflict
upon
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
bad
of
it
be
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
"
I
can
not
think
what
to
do
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
nothing
,
uncle
,
but
just
let
him
go
;
it
will
be
a
sufficient
punishment
for
such
a
man
to
feel
that
,
instead
of
succeed
in
his
design
,
he
have
only
bring
upon
himself
the
bitter
contempt
of
those
whom
he
would
fain
have
injure
.
<EOS>
I
can
have
no
desire
for
revenge
on
such
a
man
as
Marchdale
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
right
,
Charles
,
"
say
Flora
;
"
let
him
go
,
and
let
him
go
with
a
feeling
that
he
have
acquire
the
contempt
of
those
whose
good
opinion
may
have
be
his
for
a
far
less
amount
of
trouble
than
he
have
take
to
acquire
their
bad
.
"
 
<EOS>
Excitement
have
keep
up
Charles
to
this
point
,
but
now
,
when
he
arise
and
express
his
intention
of
go
to
the
ruin
,
for
the
purpose
of
release
Marchdale
,
he
exhibit
such
unequivocal
symptom
of
exhaustion
and
fatigue
that
neither
his
uncle
nor
Flora
would
permit
him
to
go
,
so
,
in
deference
to
them
,
he
give
up
the
point
,
and
commission
the
admiral
and
Jack
,
with
Henry
,
to
proceed
to
the
place
,
and
give
the
villain
his
freedom
;
little
suspect
what
have
occur
since
he
have
himself
leave
the
neighbourhood
of
those
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
Charles
Holland
could
not
be
at
all
accountable
for
the
work
of
the
element
,
and
it
be
not
for
him
to
imagine
that
when
he
leave
Marchdale
in
the
dungeon
that
so
awful
a
catastrophe
as
that
we
have
record
to
the
reader
be
to
ensue
.
 
<EOS>
the
distance
to
the
ruin
be
not
so
great
from
this
cottage
even
as
it
be
from
Bannerworth
Hall
,
provide
those
who
go
know
the
most
direct
and
good
road
to
take
;
so
that
the
admiral
be
not
go
above
a
couple
of
hour
,
and
when
he
return
he
sit
down
and
look
at
Charles
with
such
a
peculiar
expression
,
that
the
latter
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
tell
what
to
make
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
[

"
something

he

I
be
certain

Rum

suddenly
;

my

who
mention
rum

<EOS>
what
a
singular
sort
of
liquor
rum
must
be

<EOS>
I
hear
of
a
chap
as
use
to
be
fond
of
it
once
on
board
a
ship
;
I
wonder
if
there
be
any
in

house

"
 
<EOS>
"
no
!
"

the
admiral
;

but
there
be
a
fine
pump
of
spring
water
outside
if
you
feel
a
little
thirsty

Jack
;

I
will
engage
it
shall
do
you
more
good
than

<EOS>

Uncle

Charles

be
glad
to
hear

what
for

"
 
<EOS>

why

to

"
Me

cry
the

;

why
the
infernal

,
I
have
have
to
threaten
him
with
his

a
dozen
time
,
at

on

no

"
 
<EOS>

there
be

and
,
so
he
bolt
out
of
the
room
,
just
in
time
to
escape
an
inkstand
,
which
the
admiral
catch
up
and
fling
after
him

"
I
will
strike

well
,
well

I
ought
certainly

suspect
the
quarter

he
tell
it
to

so
circumstantially

with
such
an
apparent
feeling
of
regret
for
the
weakness

the

I
have

put
up
with
too
much
from
him
for
year
past

I
think
now
that
you

give

a
great

liberty

talk

I
dare

shall
be

with

I

You
can
take

into

we
shall

Jack
will

to
you

I
have
no

you
get
him
into
the
apology

then
there
be
no

about

him
another
trial

but
I
know
him
too
well
for
that

he
be
as
obstinate
as
a
mule

he
be
,

you
will
not
get
a

word
out
of
him

never

that

now

<EOS>
I
tell
you
what

Master

it

take

up

It
will

indeed

uncle

I
require
,
now
,
rest
,
for
I
be
thoroughly
exhausted

<EOS>
the
great
privation
I
have
undergo

the
amount

mental
excitement

I
have
experience

shake
his
uncle

in
a
cordial
manner
,

then
repair
to
the
apartment

have

provide
for

<EOS>
Charles
Holland
do
,
indeed
,
stand
in
need
of
repose
;
and
for
the
first
time
now
for
many
day
he
lay
down
with
serenity
at
his
heart
,
and
sleep
for
many
hour
.
<EOS>
and
be
there
not
now
a
great
and
a
happy
change
in
Flora
Bannerworth
!
<EOS>
as
if
by
magic
,
in
a
few
short
hour
,
much
of
the
bloom
of
her
before
-
fade
beauty
return
to
her
.
<EOS>
Her
step
again
recover
its
springy
lightness
;
again
she
smile
upon
her
mother
,
and
suffer
herself
to
talk
of
a
happy
future
;
for
the
dread
even
of
the
vampyre
's
visitation
have
fade
into
comparative
insignificance
against
the
heart
's
deep
dejection
which
have
come
over
her
at
the
thought
that
Charles
Holland
must
surely
be
murder
,
or
he
would
have
contrive
to
come
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
and
what
a
glorious
recompense
she
have
now
for
the
trust
confidence
with
which
she
have
cling
to
a
conviction
of
his
truth
!
<EOS>
be
it
not
great
,
now
,
to
feel
that
when
he
be
condemn
by
other
,
and
when
strong
and
unimpeachable
evidence
seem
to
be
against
him
,
she
have
cling
to
him
and
declare
her
faith
in
his
honour
,
and
weep
for
him
instead
of
condemn
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
Flora
;
you
be
of
that
order
of
noble
mind
that
,
where
once
confidence
be
give
,
give
it
fully
and
completely
,
and
will
not
harbour
a
suspicion
of
the
faith
of
the
love
one
,
a
happy
disposition
when
verify
,
as
in
this
instance
,
by
an
answer
truthfulness
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
such
a
heart
trust
not
with
judgment
--
when
that
pure
,
exalted
,
and
noble
confidence
be
give
to
an
object
unworthy
of
it
--
then
come
,
indeed
,
the
most
fearful
of
all
mental
struggle
;
and
if
the
fond
heart
,
that
have
hug
to
its
inmost
core
so
worthless
a
treasure
,
do
not
break
in
the
effort
to
discard
it
,
we
may
well
be
surprised
at
the
amount
of
fortitude
that
have
endure
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
although
the
admiral
have
say
but
<EOS>
little
concern
the
fearful
end
<EOS>
Marchdale
have
come
to
,
it
really
do
make
some
impression
upon
him
;
and
,
much
as
he
hold
in
abhorrence
the
villany
of
Marchdale
's
conduct
,
he
would
gladly
in
his
heart
have
avert
the
fate
from
him
that
he
have
bring
upon
himself
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
road
to
the
ruin
,
he
calculate
upon
take
a
different
kind
of
vengeance
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
have
get
some
distance
from
the
cottage
,
Admiral
Bell
make
a
proposal
to
Henry
to
be
his
second
while
he
fight
Marchdale
,
but
Henry
would
not
hear
of
it
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
sir
,
"
he
say
,
"
could
I
,
do
you
think
,
stand
by
and
see
a
valuable
,
revered
,
and
a
respect
life
like
yours
expose
to
any
hazard
merely
upon
the
chance
of
punish
a
villain
?
<EOS>
no
,
no
<EOS>
;
Marchdale
be
too
base
now
to
be
meet
in
honourable
encounter
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
deal
with
in
any
way
let
it
be
by
the
law
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
reasonable
enough
,
and
after
some
argument
the
admiral
coincide
in
it
,
and
then
they
begin
to
wonder
how
,
without
Charles
,
they
should
be
able
to
get
an
entrance
to
the
dungeon
,
<EOS>
for
it
have
be
his
intention
originally
,
have
he
not
feel
so
fatigued
,
to
go
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
,
however
,
as
they
get
tolerably
near
to
the
ruin
,
they
see
what
have
happen
.
<EOS>
neither
speak
,
but
they
quicken
their
pace
,
and
soon
stand
close
to
the
mass
of
stone
-
work
which
now
have
assume
so
different
a
shape
to
what
it
have
a
few
short
hour
before
.
 
<EOS>
It
need
little
examination
to
let
them
feel
certain
that
whoever
may
have
be
in
any
of
the
underground
dungeon
must
have
be
crush
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
have
mercy
upon
his
soul
!
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
amen
!
"
say
the
admiral
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
turn
away
,
and
for
some
time
they
neither
of
them
speak
,
for
their
thought
be
full
of
reflection
upon
the
horrible
death
which
Marchdale
must
have
endure
.
<EOS>
at
length
the
admiral
said--
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
tell
this
or
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
tell
it
at
once
,
"
say
Henry
;
"
let
us
have
no
secret
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
good
.
<EOS>
then
I
will
not
make
one
you
may
depend
.
<EOS>
I
only
wish
that
while
he
be
about
it
,
Charley
could
have
pop
that
rascal
Varney
as
well
in
the
dungeon
,
and
then
there
would
have
be
an
end
and
a
good
riddance
of
them
both

the
second
NIGHT
-
WATCH
of

<EOS>
CHILLINGWORTH

HALL

[

<EOS>
the
military
party
in
the
morning
leave
Bannerworth
Hall
,
and
the
old
place
resume
its
wonted
quiet
.
<EOS>
but
Dr.
Chillingworth
find
it
difficult
to
get
rid
of
his
old
friend
,
the
hangman
,
who
seem
quite
disposed
to
share
his
watch
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
without
be
at
all
accuse
of
be
a
prejudiced
man
,
may
well
object
to
the
continue
companionship
of
one
,
who
,
accord
to
his
own
account
,
be
decidedly
no
well
than
he
should
be
,
if
he
be
half
so
good
.
 
<EOS>
moreover
,
it
materially
interfere
with
the
proceeding
of
our
medical
friend
,
whose
object
be
to
watch
the
vampyre
with
all
imaginable
quietness
and
secrecy
,
in
the
event
of
his
again
visit
Bannerworth
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
he
say
,
to
the
hangman
,
"
now
that
you
have
so
obligingly
related
to
me
your
melancholy
history
,
I
will
not
detain
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
you
be
not
detain
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
but
I
shall
probably
remain
here
for
a
considerable
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
to
do
;
and
one
place
be
about
the
same
as
another
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
if
I
must
speak
plainly
,
allow
me
to
say
,
that
as
I
come
here
upon
a
very
important
and
special
errand
,
I
desire
most
particularly
to
be
leave
alone
.
<EOS>
do
you
understand
me
now
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
ah!--I
understand
;
you
want
me
to
go
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
just
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
Dr.
Chillingworth
,
allow
me
to
tell
you
,
I
have
come
here
on
a
very
special
errand
likewise
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
put
one
circumstance
to
another
,
and
draw
a
variety
of
conclusion
from
a
variety
of
fact
,
so
that
I
have
come
to
what
I
consider
an
important
resolve
,
namely
,
to
have
a
good
look
at
Bannerworth
Hall
,
and
if
I
continue
to
like
it
as
well
as
I
do
now
,
I
should
like
to
make
the

<EOS>
Dr.
Chillingworth
be
,
evidently
,
much
annoyed
,
and
yet
he
be
in
an
extremely
helpless
condition
;
for
as
to
force
the
hangman
to
leave
the
Hall
,
if
he
do
not
feel
disposed
to
do
so
,
that
be
completely
out
of
the
question
,
and
could
not
be
do
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
he
be
a
much
more
powerful
man
than
the
doctor
,
and
in
the
second
,
it
be
quite
contrary
to
all
Mr.
Chillingworth
's
habit
,
to
engage
in
anything
like
personal
warfare
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
only
,
therefore
,
look
his
vexation
,
and
say,--
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
be
determine
upon
remain
,
I
can
not
help
it
;
but
,
when
some
one
,
as
there
assuredly
will
,
come
from
the
Bannerworths
,
here
,
to
me
,
or
I
shall
be
under
the
necessity
of
state
candidly
that
you
be
intrude
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
good
.
<EOS>
as
the
morning
air
be
keen
,
and
as
we
now
be
not
likely
to
be
as
good
company
to
each
other
as
we
be
,
I
shall
go
inside
the
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
proposition
which
the
doctor
do
not
like
,
but
he
be
compel
to
submit
to
it
;
and
he
see
,
with
feeling
of
uneasiness
,
the
hangman
make
his
way
into
the
Hall
by
one
of
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
then
Dr.
Chillingworth
sit
down
to
think
.
<EOS>
much
he
wonder
what
could
be
the
secret
of
the
great
desire
<EOS>
which
Varney
,
Marchdale
,
and
even
this
man
have
,
all
of
them
to
be
possessor
of
the
old
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
that
there
be
some
powerful
incentive
he
feel
convinced
,
and
he
long
for
some
conversation
with
the
Bannerworths
,
or
with
Admiral
Bell
,
in
order
that
he
may
state
what
have
now
take
place
.
<EOS>
that
some
one
would
soon
come
to
him
,
in
order
to
bring
fresh
provision
for
the
day
,
he
be
certain
,
and
all
he
could
do
,
in
the
interim
,
be
,
to
listen
to
what
the
hangman
be
about
in
the
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
not
a
sound
,
for
a
considerable
time
,
disturb
the
intense
stillness
of
the
place
;
but
,
now
,
suddenly
,
Mr.
Chillingworth
think
he
hear
a
hammering
,
as
if
some
one
be
at
work
in
one
of
the
room
of
the
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
that
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
and
he
be
about
to
proceed
at
once
to
the
interior
of
the
building
,
through
the
same
window
which
have
enable
the
hangman
to
gain
admittance
,
when
he
hear
his
own
name
pronounce
by
some
one
at
the
back
of
the
garden
fence
,
and
upon
cast
his
eye
in
that
direction
,
he
,
to
his
great
relief
,
see
the
admiral
and
Henry
Bannerworth
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
round
to
the
gate
,
"
say
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
more
glad
to
see
you
than
I
can
tell
you
just
now
.
<EOS>
do
not
make
more
noise
than
you
can
help
;
but
,
come
round
to
the
gate
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
obey
the
injunction
with
alacrity
,
and
when
the
doctor
have
admit
them
,
the
admiral
say
,
eagerly,--
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
mean
to
tell
us
that
he
be
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
not
Varney
;
but
he
be
not
the
only
one
who
have
take
a
great
affection
for
Bannerworth
Hall
;
you
may
have
another
tenant
for
it
,

I
believe
at
any
price
you
like
to
name
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
<EOS>
creep
along
close
to
the
house
,
and
then
you
will
not
be
see
.
<EOS>
there
!
do
you
hear
that
noise
in
the
hall
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
it
sound
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
"
like
the
ship
's
carpenter
at
work
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
do
,
indeed
,
sound

a
carpenter
;

be
only
the
new
tenant
making
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
some
repair
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
D
--
n
his
impudence
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
it
certainly
do
look
like
a
very
cool
proceeding
,
I
must
admit
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
who
,
and
what
be
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
who
he
be
now
,
I
can
not
tell
you
,
but
he
be
once
the
hangman
of
London
,
at
a
time
when
I
be
practise
in
the
metropolis
,
and
so
I
become
acquainted
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
know
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
and
,
if
I
mistake
not
,
have
find
out
the
cause
of
that
mysterious
personage
's
great
attachment
to
Bannerworth
Hall
,
and
have
find
the
reason
so
cogent
,
that
he
have
get
up
an
affection
for
it
himself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
to
me
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
all
this
be
as
incomprehensible
as
anything
can
possibly
be
.
<EOS>
what
on
earth
do
it
all
mean
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Henry
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
will
you
be
rule
by
me
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
rule
by
any
one
whom
I
know
I
can
trust
;
for
I
be
like
a
man
grope
his
way
in
the
dark
.

"
 
<EOS>
"
then
allow
this
gentleman
who
be
carpenter
away
so
pleasantly
within
the
house
,
to
do
so
to
his
heart
's
content
,
but
do
not
let
him
leave
it
.
<EOS>
show
yourself
now
in
the
garden
,
he
have
sufficient
prudence
to
know
that
three
constitute
rather
fearful
odd
against
one
,
and
so
he
will
be
careful
,
and
remain
where
he
be
.
<EOS>
if
he
should
come
out
,
we
need
not
let
him
go
until
we
thoroughly
ascertain
what
he
have
be
about
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
command
the
squadron
,
doctor
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
"
and
have
it
all
your
own
way
,
you
know
,
so
here
go
!
<EOS>
come
along
,
Henry
,
and
let
's
show
ourselves
;
we
be
both
armed
too
!
"
 
<EOS>
They
walk
out
into
the
centre
of
the
garden
,
and
they
be
soon
convince
that
the
hangman
see
them
,
for
a
face
appear
at
the
window
,
and
be
as
quickly
withdraw
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
now
he
know
he
be
a
prisoner
,
and
we
may
as
well
place
ourselves
in
some
position
which
command
a
good
view
of
the
house

as
well
as
of
the
garden
gate

so
see
if

him
out

starve
out

not

from

you
ample
supply

storm
of
last
night

he
be

work

so
industrious

be
,
indeed

a
tremendous
amount
of
hammering
and
noise
,
of
one
sort

another
,
from
the
house

and
it
be
quite
clear
that
the
hangman
be
too
heart
and
soul
in
his
work

whatever
may
have
be
the
object
of
it
,
to
care

to
him

to
what
conjecture
he
give
rise

<EOS>
He
think
probably
that
he
could
<EOS>

he
stop
in
what
he
be
about

,
until
he
be
so
,
that
he
may
as
well
go
on

and
on
he
go
,
with
a
vengeance
,
vex
the
admiral
terribly
,
who
propose
so
repeatedly
to
go
into
the
house

insist
upon

what
he
be
about

that
his

wish
be

the
point

they
be
combat
by
the

when
,
from
the
window
at

out
step
the
hangman

<EOS>
"
good
morning

gentleman
!

good
morning

fast

you
up

He
draw
a

from

point
it
at

thereupon
pause

another

the
hangman
hesitate
a
moment
,
and
look
at
Admiral
Bell
;
apparently
the
result
of
the
scrutiny
be
,
that
he
would
keep
his
word
,
for
he
suddenly
turn
and
dive
in
at

gentle
ring
at

over

in

be
repeat

the
three
confederate

themselves
effectually
behind
some
thick
laurel
bush

await
with
expectation

VARNEY
in
the
GARDEN.--THE
COMMUNICATION
of
DR
.
<EOS>
chillingworth
to
the
ADMIRAL
and
HENRY
.
  
<EOS>
[
illustration
]
 
Kind
reader
,
it
be
indeed
Varney
who
have
clamber
over
the
garden
wall
,
and
thus
make
his
way
into
the
garden
of
Bannerworth
Hall
;
and
what
fill
those
who
look
at
him
with
the
most
surprise
be
,
that
he
do
not
seem
in
any
particular
way
to
make
a
secret
of
his
presence
,
but
walk
on
with
an
air
of
boldness
which
either
arise
from
a
feeling
of
absolute
impunity
,
from
his
thinking
there
be
no
one
there
,
or
from
an
audacity
which
none
<EOS>
but
he
could
have
compass
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
the
little
party
that
be
there
assemble
,
and
who
look
upon
him
,
they
seem
thunderstricken
by
his
presence
;
and
Henry
,
probably
,
as
well
as
the
admiral
,
would
have
burst
out
into
some
sudden
exclamation
,
have
they
not
be
restrain
by
Dr.
Chillingworth
,
who
,
suspect
that
they
may
in
some
way
give
an
alarm
,
hasten
to
speak
first
,
say
in
a
whisper,--
 
<EOS>
"
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
be
still
,
fortune
,
you
see
,
favour
us
most
strangely
.
<EOS>
leave
Varney
alone
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
other
mode
<EOS>
whatever
of
discover
what
he
really
want
at
Bannerworth
Hall
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
you
have
speak
,
"
say
Henry
,
as
he
draw
a
long
breath
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
have
not
,
I
feel
convinced
that
in
another
moment
I
should
have
rush
forward
and
confront
this
man
who
have
be
the
very
bane
of
my
life
.
"
 
"
and
so
should
I
,
"
say
the
admiral
;
"
although
I
protest
against
any
harm
be
do
to
him
,
on
account
of
some
sort
of
good
feeling
that
he
have
display
,
after
all
,
in
release
Charles
from
that
dungeon
in
which
Marchdale
have
perish
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
at
the
moment
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
I
have
forget
that
;
but
I
will
own
that
his
conduct
have
be
tincture
by
a
strange
and
wild
kind
of
generosity
at
time
,
which
would
seem
to
bespeak
,
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
,
some
good
feeling
,
the
impulse
of
which
be
only
quench
by
circumstance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
my
firm
impression
of
him
,
I
can
assure
you
,
"
say
Dr.
Chillingworth
.
 
<EOS>
They
watch
Varney
now
from
the
leafy
covert
in
which
they
be
situate
,
and
,
indeed
,
have
they
be
less
effectually
conceal
,
it
do
not
seem
likely
that
the
much
dreaded
vampyre
would
have
perceive
them
;
for
not
only
do
he
make
no
effort
at
concealment
himself
,
but
he
take
no
pain
to
see
if
any
one
be
watch
him
in
his
progress
to
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
His
footstep
be
more
rapid
than
they
usually
be
,
and
there
be
altogether
an
air
and
manner
about
him
,
as
if
he
be
move
to
some
purpose
which
of
itself
be
sufficiently
important
to
submerge
in
its
consequence
all
ordinary
risk
and
all
ordinary
caution
.
 
<EOS>
He
try
several
window
of
the
house
along
that
terrace
of
which
we
have
more
than
once
have
occasion
to
speak
,
before
he
find
one
that
open
;
but
at
length
he
do
succeed
,
and
step
at
once
into
the
Hall
,
leave
those
,
who
now
for
some
moment
in
silence
have
regard
his
movement
,
to
lose
themselves
in
a
fearful
sea
of
conjecture
as
to
what
could
possibly
be
his
object
.
 
<EOS>
"
at
all
event
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
"
I
be
glad
we
be
here
.
<EOS>
if
the
vampyre
should
have
a
fight
with
that
other
fellow
,
that
we
hear
do
such
a
lot
of
carpenter
work
in
the
house
,
we
ought
,
I
think
,
to
see
fair
play
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
,
for
one
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
would
not
like
to
stand
by
and
see
the
vampyre
murder
;
but
I
be
inclined
to
think
he
be
a
good
match
for
any
mortal
opponent
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
depend
he
be
,
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
how
long
,
doctor
,
do
you
purpose
that
we
should
wait
here
in
such
a
state
of
suspense
as
to
what
be
go
on
within
the
house
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
long
;
but
that
something
will
occur
to
make
us
have
food
for
action
.
<EOS>
hark
!
<EOS>
what
be
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
loud
crash
within
the
building
,
as
of
broken
glass
.
<EOS>
It
sound
as
if
some
window
have
be
completely
dash
in
;
but
although
they
look
carefully
over
the
front
of
the
building
,
they
could
see
no
evidence
of
such
a
thing
have
happen
,
and
be
compel
,
consequently
,
to
come
to
the
opinion
that
Varney
and
the
other
man
must
have
meet
in
one
of
the
back
room
,
and
that
the
crash
of
glass
have
arise
from
some
personal
conflict
in
which
they
have
engage
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
stand
this
,
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
nay
,
"
say
the
doctor
;
"
be
still
,
and
I
will
tell
you
something
,
than
which
there
can
be
no
more
fitting
time
than
this
to
reveal
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
refer
it
to
the
vampyre
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
do
--
it
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
brief
,
then
;
I
be
in
an
agony
of
impatience
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
circumstance
concern
which
I
can
be
brief
;
for
,
horrible
as
it
be
,
I
have
no
wish
to
dress
it
in
any
adventitious
colour
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
although
under
another
name
,
be
an
old
acquaintance
of
mine
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Acquaintance
!
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
do
not
mean
to
say
you
be
a
vampyre
?
"
say
the
admiral
;
"
or
that
he
have
ever
visit
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
;
<EOS>
but
I
know
him
.
<EOS>
from
the
first
moment
that
I
look
upon
him
in
this
neighbourhood
,
I
think
I
know
him
;
but
the
circumstance
which
induce
me
to
think
so
be
of
so
terrific
a
character
,
that
I
make
some
effort
to
chase
it
from
my
mind
.
<EOS>
It
have
,
however
,
grow
upon
me
day
by
day
,
and
,
lately
,
I
have
have
proof
sufficient
to
convince
me
of
his
identity
with
one
whom
I
first
see
under
most
singular
circumstance
of
romance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
say
on,--you
be
agitate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
this
revelation
have
several
time
,
within
the
last
few
day
,
tremble
on
my
lip
,
but
now
you
shall
have
it
;
because
you
ought
to
know
all
that
it
be
possible
for
me
to
tell
you
of
him
who
have
cause
you
so
serious
an
amount
of
disturbance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
awaken
,
doctor
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
all
my
interest
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
mine
,
too
,
"
remark
the
admiral
.
<EOS>
"
what
can
it
be
all
about
?
<EOS>
and
where
,
doctor
,
do
you
first
see
this
Varney
the
vampyre
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
in
his
coffin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
both
the
admiral
and
Henry
give
start
of
surprise
as
,
with
one
accord
,
they
exclaimed,--
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
say
coffin
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
:
I
tell
you
,
on
my
word
of
honour
,
that
the
first
time
in
my
life
I
see
ever
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
be
in
his
coffin
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
he
be
a
vampyre
,
and
there
can
be
no
mistake
,
"
say
the
admiral
.
 
<EOS>
"
go
on
,
I
pray
you
,
doctor
,
go
on
,
"
say
Henry
,
anxiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
.
<EOS>
the
reason
why
he
become
the
inhabitant
of
a
coffin
be
simply
this:--he
have
be
hanged,--execute
at
the
Old
Bailey
,
in
London
,
before
ever
I
set
eye
upon
that
strange
countenance
of
his
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
I
be
practise
surgery
at
the
London
school
some
year
ago
,
and
that
,
consequently
,
as
I
commence
the
profession
rather
late
in
life
,
I
be
extremely
anxious
to
do
the
most
I
could
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
--
yes
.
"
 
"
arrive
,
then
,
with
plenty
of
resource
,
which
I
do
not
,
as
the
young
man
who
affect
to
be
study
in
the
same
class
as
myself
,
spend
in
the
pursuit
of
what
they
consider
life
in
London
,
I
be
indefatigable
in
my
professional
labour
,
and
there
be
nothing
connect
with
them
which
I
do
not
try
to
accomplish
.
 
<EOS>
"
at
that
period
,
the
difficulty
of
get
a
subject
for
anatomization
be
very
great
,
and
all
sort
of
scheme
have
to
be
put
into
requisition
to
accomplish
so
desirable
,
and
,
indeed
,
absolutely
necessary
a
purpose

I
become
acquainted
with
the
man
who
,
I
have

you
,
be
in
the
Hall
,
at
present
,
and
who
then
fill
the
unenviable
post
of
public
executioner
.
<EOS>
It
so
happen
,
too
,
that
I
have
read
a
learned
treatise
,
by
a
Frenchman
,
who
have
make
a
vast
number
of
experiment
with
galvanic
and
other
apparatus
,
upon
person
who
have
come
to
death
in
different
way
,
and
,
in
one
case
,
he
assert
that
he
have
actually
recover
a
man
who
have
be
hang
,
and
he
have
live
five
week
afterwards

<EOS>
"
Young
as
I
then
be
,
in
comparison
to
what
I
be
now
,
in
my
profession

this
inflame
my
imagination
,
and
nothing
seem
to
me
so
desirable
as
get
hold
of
some
one
who
have
only
recently
be
put
to
death
,
for
the
purpose
of
try
what
I
could
do
in
the
way
of
attempt
a
resuscitation
of
the
subject

It
be
precisely
for
this
reason
that
I
seek
out
the
public
executioner
,
and
make
his
acquaintance
,
whom
every
one

I

I
would
come
forward

claim

unmoved

strong

knit
frame

rather
a
strange

what

you

I
do
not
hesitate
,
but
,
on
the
morning
before
the
execution
,
I
call
upon
one
of
the
sheriff
.
 
<EOS>

I
tell
him
that
the
condemn
man

to
me

as
I
know
nothing
could
be
do
to
save
him
on

trial

I
have
abstain
from
come
forward
;

that
as
I
do
not
like
the
idea
of
his
be
rudely
inter
by
the
authority

I
have
come
forward
to
ask
for
the
body
,
after
the
execution
should
have
take
place
,
in
order
that
I
may
,
at
all
event

bestow
upon
it
,
in
some
sequester
spot

a
decent
burial

with
all
the
rite
of
the
church

"
the
sheriff
be
a
man
not
overburthene
with
penetration

<EOS>
He
applaud
my
pious
feeling
,
and
actually
give
me
,
without
any
inquiry
,
a
write
order
to
receive
the
body
from
the
hand
of
the
hangman

after
it

hang
the
hour

I
do
not
,
as
you
may
well
suppose
,
wish
to
appear
more
in
the
business
than
be
absolutely
necessary
;

I
give
the
executioner
the
sheriff
's
order
for
the
body

he
promise
that
he
would
get
a
shell
ready

place
it
in

four
stout

carry
it

you

sudden

let
him
down
gently

shall
die

suffocation

on

at
length
I
hear
the
sound
of
wheel

find
that

have
procure
a
cart

in

bring
the

that
about

quarter

nine
o'clock
the
vehicle

its
ghastly
content

stop
at

in
my

down

ninety

nine

go
some
distance
to
avoid
the
sight

livid

fresh
from

gallow

I
,
however
,
herald
it
as
a
great
gift
,

already
,
in
imagination
I
see
myself
imitate
the
learned
Frenchman

who
have
publish
such
an
elaborate
treatise
on
the
mode
of
restore
life
under
all

dead

"
to
be
sure
,
a
sort
of
feeling
have
come
over
me

time

as
I
do
that
the
French
be
a
nation
that
do
not
scruple
at
all
to
sacrifice
truth
on
the
altar
of
vanity
,
that
it
may
be
after
all
a
mere
rhodomontade

,
however
,
I
could
only
ascertain
so
much
by
actually
try
,
so
the
suspicion
that
such
might
,
by
a
possibility
,
be
the
end
of
the
adventure

do
not
deter
me

I
officiously
assist
in

the
coffin
bring
into
the
room

I
have
prepare
everything
that
be
necessary

the
conduction

then
,

more
prudent

before

he
said,--

I
be
headstrong
on

could
think

nothing

the
success

non

success

in
a
physiological
point

of

I
set
about

a
completeness

the
altercation
between

EXECUTIONER

HALL.--THE
MUTUAL
AGREEMENT

[

<EOS>
there
be
certainly
a
loud
wrangling
in
the
Hall
,
just
as
the
doctor
finish
his
most
remarkable
revelation
concern
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
a
revelation
which
by
no
means
attack
the
fact
of
his
be
a
vampyre
or
not
;
but
rather
on
the
contrary
,
have
a
tendency
to
confirm
any
opinion
that
may
arise
from
the
circumstance
of
his
be
restore
to
life
after
his
execution
,
favourable
to
that
belief
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
three
now
carefully
approach
the
window
of
the
Hall
,
to
listen
to
what
be
go
on
,
and
after
a
few
moment
they
distinctly
hear
the
voice
of
the
hangman
,
say
in
loud
and
rather
angry
accents,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
deny
but
that
you
have
keep
your
word
with
me
--
our
bargain
have
be
,
as
you
say
,
a
profitable
one
:
<EOS>

still

not

why
that
circumstance

give
you
any

control
over
my
action

what

the

Nay

mine

where
I

,
the
theme
of
conversation
be
Varney
,
the
vampyre
!
<EOS>
and
it
be
implicitly
believe
that
you
be
one
of
those
dreadful
character
that
feed
upon
the
life

blood
of
other

only
now

then

the
tomb
to
which
you
ought
long

to
have
go
in
peace

"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
what
,
in
the
name
of
all
that
be
inexplicable
,
have
induce
you
to
enact
such
a
character
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
enact
it
!
<EOS>
you
say
.
<EOS>
Can
you
,
then
,
from
all
you
have
hear
of
me
,
and
from
all
you
know
of
me
,
not
conceive
it
possible
that
I
be
not
enact
any
such
character
?
<EOS>
why
may
it
not
be
real
?
<EOS>
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
do
I
look
like
one
of
the
inhabitant
of

earth

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
in
sooth
,
you
do
not
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
yet
I
be
,
as
you
see
,
upon
it
.
<EOS>
do
not
,
with
an
affected
philosophy
,
doubt
all
that
may
happen
to
be
in
any
degree
repugnant
to
your
usual
experience
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
one
disposed
to
do
so
;
nor
be
I
prepared
to
deny
that
such
dreadful
being
may
exist
as
vampyre
.
<EOS>
however
,
whether
or
not
you
belong
to
so
frightful
a
class
of
creature
,
I
do
not
intend
to
leave
here
;
but
,
I
will
make
an
agreement
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Varney
be
silent
;
and
after
a
few
moment
'
pause
,
the
other
exclaimed,--
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
people
,
even
now
,
watch
the
place
,
and
no
doubt
you
have
be

come
into
it

"
no
,
no
,
I
be
satisfied
no
one
be
here

you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
a
Doctor
Chillingworth
,
of
whom
you
know
something
,
be
here
;
and
him
,
you
have
say
,
you
would
do
no
harm
to
,
even
to
save
your
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
know
him
.
<EOS>
You
tell
me
that
it
be
to
him
that
I
be
mainly
indebted
for
my
mere
existence
;
and
although
I
do
not
consider
human
life
to
be
a
great
boon
,
I
can
not
bring
myself
to
raise
my
hand
against
the
man
who
,
whatever
may
have
be
the
motive
for
the
deed
,
at
all
event
,
do
snatch
me
from
the
grave
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
"
whisper
the
admiral
,
"
there
be
something
about
that
fellow
that
I
like
,
after
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
say
Henry
,
"
listen
to
them
.
<EOS>
this
would
all
have
be
unintelligible
to
us
,
if
you
have
not
relate
to
us
what
you
have

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
tell
you
in
time

Chillingworth

"
it
seem
.

"
 
"
Will
you
,
then
,
"

the

,
"
listen
to
proposal
?

"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"

Varney
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
along
,
then
,

I
will
show
you
what
I
have
be
about
;

I
rather
think
you
have
already
a
shrewd
guess
as
to
my
motive

this
way
--
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
move
off
to
some
other
part
of
the
mansion
,
and
the
sound
of
their
voice
gradually
die
away
,
so
that
after
all
,
the
friend
have
not
get
the
least
idea
of
what
that
motive
be
,
which
still
induce
the
vampyre
and
the
hangman
,
rather
than
leave
the
other
on
the
premise
,
to
make
an
agreement
to
stay
with
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
to
be
do
now
?
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
wait
,
"
say
Dr.
Chillingworth
,
"
wait
,
and
watch
still
.

I
see
nothing
else
that
can
be
do
with
any
degree
of
safety
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
what
be
we
to
wait
for
?
"
say
the
admiral
.
 
<EOS>
"
by
wait
,
we
shall
,
perhaps
,
find
out
,
"
be
the
doctor
's
reply
;
"
but
you
may
depend
that
we
never
shall
by
interfere
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
be
it
so
.
<EOS>
It
seem
that
we
have
no
other
resource
.
<EOS>
and
when
either
or
both
of
those
fellow
make
their
appearance
,
and
seem
about
to
leave
,
what
be
to
be
do
with
them
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
must
be
seize
then
,
and
in
order
that
that
may
be
do
without
any
bloodshed
,
we
ought
to
have
plenty
of
force
here
.
<EOS>
Henry
,
could
you
get
your
brother
,
and
Charles
,
if
he
be
sufficiently
recover
,
to
come
?
<EOS>
"
 
"
<EOS>
certainly
,
and
Jack
Pringle
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
"
no
Jack
Pringle
for
me
;
<EOS>
I
have
do
with
him
completely
,

I
have
make
up
my
mind
to
strike
him
off
the
ship
's
book
,

have
nothing
more
to

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

well

well

"
add
the
doctor
,
"
we
will
not
have
him
,
then
;
and
it
be
just
as
well
,
for
,
in
all
likelihood
,
he
would
come
drunk
,
and
we
shall
be
--
let
me
see
--
five
strong
without
him
,
which
ought
to
be
enough
to
take
prisoner
two
man
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
although
one
of
them
may
be
a
vampyre
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
make
no
difference
,
"
say
the
admiral
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
as
soon
take
a
ship
man
with
vampyre
as
with
Frenchmen
.
"
 
<EOS>
Henry
start
off
upon
his
errand
,
certainly
leave
the
admiral
and
the
doctor
in
rather
a
critical
situation
while
he
be
go
;
for
have
Varney
the
vampyre
and
the
hangman
choose
,
they
could
certainly
easily
have
overcome
so
inefficient
a
force
.
 
<EOS>
the
admiral
would
,
of
course
,
have
fight
,
and
so
may
the
doctor
,
as
far
as
his
hand
would
permit
him
;
but
if
the
other
have
really
be
intent
upon
mischief
,
they
could
,
from
their
downright
superior
physical
power
,
have
take
the
life
of
the
two
that
be
oppose
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
but
somehow
the
doctor
appear
to
have
a
great
confidence
in
the
affair
.
<EOS>
whether
that
confidence
arise
from
what
the
vampyre
have
say
with
regard
to
him
,
or
from
any
hide
conviction
of
his
own
that
they
would
not
yet
emerge
from
the
Hall
,
we
can
not
say
;
but
certain
it
be
,
he
wait
the
course
of
event
with
great
coolness
.
 
<EOS>
no
noise
for
some
time
come
from
the
house
;
but
then
the
sound
,
as
if
workman
be
busy
within
it
,
be
suddenly
resume
,
and
with
more
vigour
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
nearly
two
hour
before
Henry
make
the
private
signal
which
have
be
agree
upon
as
that
which
should
proclaim
his
return
;
and
<EOS>
then
he
and
his
brother
,
with
Charles
,
who
,
when
he
hear
of
the
matter
,
would
,
notwithstanding
the
persuasion
of
Flora
to
the
contrary
,
come
,
get
quietly
over
the
fence
at
a
part
of
the
garden
which
be
quite
hide
from
the
house
by
abundant
vegetation
,
and
the
whole
three
of
them
take
up
a
position
that
tolerably
well
command
a
view
of
the
house
,
while
they
be
themselves
extremely
well
hide
behind
a
dense
mass
of
evergreen
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
see
that
rascal
,
Jack
Pringle
?
"
say
the
admiral
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Henry
;
"
he
be
drunk

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
we
have
no
little
difficulty
in
shake
him
off
.
<EOS>
He
suspect
where
we
be
go
;
but
I
think
,
by
be
peremptory
,
we
get
fairly
rid
of
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
vagabond
!
<EOS>
if
he
come
here
,
I
will
brain
him
,
I
will
,
the
swab
.
<EOS>
why
,
lately
he
be
do
nothing
but
drink
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
way
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
will
go
on
sometimes
for
a
year
and
more
,
and
not
take
more
than
enough
to
do
him
good
,
and
then
all
at
once
,
for
about
six
or
eight
week
,
he
do
nothing
but
drink
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
we
can
do
without
him
,
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
without
him
!
<EOS>
I
should
think
so
.
<EOS>
do
you
hear
those
fellow
in
the
Hall
at
work
?
<EOS>
d
--
<EOS>
n
me
,
if
I
have
not
all
of
a
sudden
thought
what
the
reason
of
it
all
be
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
--
what
?
<EOS>
"
say
the
doctor
,
anxiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
that
rascal
Varney
,
you
know
,
have
his
house
burn
down
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
well
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
well
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
do
not
think
it
well
.
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
he
no
doubt
want
another
;
so
,
you
see
,
my
idea
be
,
that
he
be
steal
the
material
from
Bannerworth
Hall
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
be
that
your
notion
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
and
a
very
natural
one
,
I
think
,
too
,
Master
Doctor
,
whatever
you
may
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
come
,
now
,
have
you
a
well
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
dear
,
no
,
certainly
not
<EOS>
;
but
I
have
a
notion
that
something
to
eat
would
comfort
the
inward
man
much
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
so
would
something
to
drink
,
blow
me
if
it
would
not

"
say
Jack
Pringle
,
suddenly
make
his
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
the
admiral
make
a
rush
upon
him
;
but
he
be
restrain
by
the
other
,
and
Jack
,
with
a
look
of
triumph
,
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
what
be
amiss
with
you
now
?
<EOS>
I

not

<EOS>
come

come

you
have
something
dangerous
in
the
wind

I
know

so
I
have
make
up
my
mind
to
be
in
it

so
do
not

yourself
out

yonder

my

"
 
<EOS>
"
good
God
!
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
what
shall
we
do
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
nothing
,
"
say
Jack
,
as
he
take
a
bottle
from
his
pocket
and
apply
the
neck
of
it
to
his
lips--"nothing
--
nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
something
to
begin
with
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
as
with
his
stick
he
give
the
bottle
a
sudden
blow
that
break
it
and
spill
all
its
content
,
leave
Jack
petrify
,
with
the
bit
of
the
neck

still
in

like

be
that
the

<EOS>
first
-
rater
?
<EOS>
My
eye--
"
 
"
hold
your
noise
,
<EOS>
will
you
;
you
be
not
drunk
yet
,
and
I
be
determined
that
you
should
not
get
so
,
which
you
soon
would
with
that
rum
-
bottle
,
if
I
have
not
come
with
a
broadside
across
it
.
<EOS>
now
you
may
stay
;
but
,
mark
me
<EOS>
,
you
be
on
active
service
now
,
and
must
do
nothing
without
order
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
,
your
honour
,
"
say
Jack
,
as
he
drop
the
neck
of
the
bottle
,
and
look
ruefully
upon
the
ground
,
from
whence
arise
the
aroma
of
rum--"ay
,
ay
;
but
it
be
a
hard
case
,
take
it
how
you
will
,
to
have
your
grog
stop
;
but
,
d
--
n
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
,
I
never
have
it
stop
yet
when
it
be
in
my
mouth
.
"
 
<EOS>
Henry
and
Charles
could
not
forbear
a
smile
at
Jack
's
discomfiture
,
which
,
however
,
they
be
very
glad
of
,
for
they
know
full
well
<EOS>
his
failing
,
and
that
in
the
course
of
another
half
hour
he
would
have
be
drunk
,
and
incapable
of
be
control
,
except
,
as
on
some
former
occasion
,
by
the
exercise
of
brute
force
.
 
<EOS>
but
Jack
be
evidently
displeased
,
and
consider
himself
to
be
grievously
insult
,
which
,
after
all
,
be
the
well
,
inasmuch
as
,
while
he
be
brood
over
his
wrong
<EOS>
,
he
be
quiet
;
when
,
otherwise
,
it
may
have
be
a
very
difficult
matter
to
make
him
so
.
 
<EOS>
They
partook
of
some
refreshment
,
and
,
as
the
day
advance
,
the
brother
Bannerworth
,
as
well
as
Charles
Holland
,
begin
to
get
very
anxious
upon
the
subject
of
the
proceeding
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
in
the
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
They
converse
in
low
tone
,
exhaust
every
,
as
they
consider
,
possible
conjecture
to
endeavour
to
account
for
his
mysterious
predilection
for
that
abode
,
but
nothing
occur
to
them
of
a
sufficiently
probable
motive
to
induce
them
to
adopt
it
as
a
conclusion
.
 
<EOS>
They
more
than
suspect
Dr.
Chillingworth
,
because
he
be
so
silent
,
and
hazard
no
conjecture
at
all
of
know
something
,
or
of
have
form
to
himself
some
highly
probable
hypothesis
upon
the
subject
;
but
they
could
not
get
him
to
agree
that
such
be
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
challenge
him
upon
the
subject
,
all
he
would
say
was,--
 
"
My
good
friend
,
you
perceive
that
,
there
be
a
great
mystery
somewhere
,
and
I
do
hope
that
to
-
night
it
will
be
clear
up
satisfactorily
.
"
 
<EOS>
with
this
they
be
compel
to
be
satisfied
;
and
now
the
soft
and
sombre
shade
of
evening
begin
to
creep
over
the
scene
,
envelop
all
object
in
the
dimness
and
repose
of
early
night
.
 
<EOS>
the
noise
from
the
house
have
cease
,
and
all
be
profoundly
still
.
<EOS>
but
more
than
once
Henry
fancy
he
hear
footstep
outside
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
He
mention
his
suspicion
to
Charles
Holland
,
who
immediately
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
the
same
thing
have
come
to
my
ear
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
<EOS>
then
it
must
be
so
;
we
can
not
both
of
us
have
merely
imagine
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
You
may
depend
that
this
place
be
beleaguer
in
some
way
,
and
that
to
-
night
will
be
productive
of
event
which
will
throw
a
great
light
upon
the
affair
connect
with
this
vampyre
that
have
hitherto
baffle
conjecture
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
say
Charles
;
"
there
,
again
;
I
be
quite
confident
I
hear
a
sound
as
of
a
broken
twig
outside
the
garden
-
wall
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
and
the
admiral
be
in
deep
discussion
about
something,--shall
<EOS>
we
tell
them
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
;
let
us
listen
,
as
yet
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
bend
all
their
attention
to
listening
,
incline
their
ear
towards
the
ground
,
and
,
after
a
few
moment
,
they
feel
confident
that
more
than
one
footstep
be
creep
along
,
as
cautiously
as
possible
,
under
the
garden
wall
.
<EOS>
after
a
few
moment
'
consultation
,
Henry
make
up
his
mind
--
he
be
the
best
acquaint
with
the
locality
of
the
place
--
to
go
and
reconnoitre
,
so
<EOS>
he
,
without
say
anything
to
the
doctor
or
the
admiral
,
glide
from
where
he
be
,
in
the
direction
of
a
part
of
the
fence
which
he
know
he
could
easily
scale

the
VAMPYRE

danger.--the
LAST

ruse
of
HENRY
BANNERWORTH

[

<EOS>
yet
know
to
what
deed
of
violence
the
passion
of
a
lawless
mob
will
sometimes
lead
them
,
and
have
the
experience
of
what
have
be
attempt
by
the
alarmed
and
infuriate
populace
on
a
former
occasion
,
against
the
Hall
,
Henry
Bannerworth
be
,
reasonably
enough
,
not
without
his
fear
that
something
may
occur
of
a
nature
yet
highly
dangerous
to
the
stability
of
his
ancient
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
actually
surmount
the
fence
,
but
he
creep
so
close
to
it
,
that
he
could
get
over
in
a
moment
,
if
he
wish
;
and
,
if
any
one
should
move
or
speak
on
the
other
side
,
he
should
be
quite
certain
to
hear
them
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
few
moment
all
be
still
,
and
then
suddenly
he
hear
some
one
say
,
in
a
low
voice
,
 
<EOS>
"
Hist
!
<EOS>
hist
!
<EOS>
do
you
hear
nothing
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
do
,
"
say
another
;
"
but
I
now
be
doubtful
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
listen
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
,
"
think
Henry
,
"
can
be
the
motive
of
these
man
lie
secrete
here
?
<EOS>
It
be
most
extraordinary
what
they
can
possibly
want
,
unless
they
be
brew
danger
for
the
Hall
.
"
 
<EOS>
most
cautiously
now
he
raise
himself
,
so
that
his
eye
could
just
look
over
the
fence
,
and
then
,
indeed
,
he
be
astonish
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
expect
to
see
two
or
three
person
,
at
the
utmost
;
what
be
his
surprise
!
<EOS>
to
find
a
compact
mass
of
man
crouch
down
under
the
garden
wall
,
as
far
as
his
eye
could
reach
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
few
moment
,
he
be
so
surprised
,
that
he
continue
to
gaze
on
,
heedless
of
the
danger
there
may
be
from
a
discovery
that
he
be
play
the
part
of
a
spy
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
when
,
however
,
his
first
sensation
of
surprise
be
over
,
he
cautiously
remove
to
his
former
position
,
and
,
just
as
he
do
,
so
,
he
hear
those
who
have
before
speak
,
again
,
in
low
tone
,
break
the
stillness
of
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
resolve
upon
it
,
"
say
one
;
"
I
be
quite
determined
.
<EOS>
I
will
,
please
God
,
rid
the
country
of
that
dreadful
man
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
do
not
call
him
a
man
,
"
say
the
oilier
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
;
it
be
a
wrong
name
to
apply
to
a
vampyre
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
Varney
,
after
all
,
then
,
"
say
Henry
.
<EOS>
Bannerworth
,
to
himself;--"it
be
his
life
that
they
seek
.
<EOS>
what
can
be
do
to
save
him?--for
<EOS>
save
he
shall
be
if
I
can
compass
such
an
object
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
there
be
yet
a
something
in
his
character
which
be
entitle
to
consideration
,
and
he
shall
not
be
savagely
murder
while
I
have
an
arm
to
raise
in
his
defence
.
<EOS>
but
if
anything
be
now
to
be
do
,
it
must
be
do
by
stratagem
,
for
the
enemy
be
,
by
far
,
in
too
great
force
to
be
personally
combat
with
.
"
 
<EOS>
Henry
resolve
to
take
the
advice
of
his
friend
,
and
with
that
view
he
go
silently
and
quietly
back
to
where
they
be
,
and
communicate
to
them
the
news
that
he
have
so
unexpectedly
discover
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
all
much
surprised
,
and
then
the
doctor
say
,
 
"
You
may
depend
,
that
since
the
disappointment
of
the
mob
in
the
destruction
of
this
place
,
they
have
have
their
eye
upon
Varney
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
dog
here
by
some
one
,
and
then
by
degree
that
assemblage
have
seek
the
spot
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
doomed
man
,
then
,
"
remark
the
admiral
;
"
for
what
can
save
him
from
a
determined
number
of
person
,
who
,
by
main
force
,
will
overcome

,
let
us
make
what
stand
we
may
in

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
there
no

place
in
the
house
,
"
say
Charles
,
"
where
you
may
,
after
warn
him
of
his
danger
,
conceal
him
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
plenty
,
but
of
what
avail
would
that
be
,
if
they
burn
down
the
Hall
,
which
in
all
probability
they
will
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
none
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
but
one
chance
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
and
that
be
to
throw
them
off
the
scent
,
and
induce
them
to
think
that
he
whom
they
seek
be
not
here
<EOS>
;
I
think
that
may
possibly
be
do
by
boldness
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
how
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
among
them
and
make
the
effort
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
at
once
leave
the
friend
,
for
he
feel
that
there
may
be
no
time
to
lose
,
and
hasten
to
the
same
part
of
the
wall
,
over
which
he
have
look
so
short
a
time
before
,
he
clamber
over
it
,
and
cry
,
in
a
loud
voice
,
 
"
stop
the
vampyre
!

stop
the

"
 
<EOS>
"
where

shout
a
number
of
person
at
once

turn
their

eagerly
towards
the
spot

Henry
stand

Henry

MURDER

[

<EOS>
the
mob
reach
the
ruin
of
Bannerworth
Hall
,
and
crowd
round
it
on
all
side
,
with
the
view
of
ascertain
if
a
human
creature
,
dead
or
alive
,
be
there
;
various
surmise
be
afloat
,
and
some
be
for
consider
that
everybody
but
themselves
,
or
their
friend
,
must
be
nothing
less
than
vampyre
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
a
strange
man
,
suddenly
appear
among
them
,
would
have
cause
a
sensation
,
and
a
ring
would
no
doubt
have
be
form
round
him
,
and
then
a
hasty
council
hold
,
or
,
what
be
more
probable
,
some
shout
,
or
word
utter
by
some
one
behind
,
who
could
not
understand
what
be
go
on
in
front
,
would
have
determine
them
to
commit
some
desperate
outrage
,
and
the
sacrifice
of
life
would
have
be
the
inevitable
result
of
such
an
unfortunate
concurrence
of
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
pause
before
anyone
venture
among
the
ruin
;
the
wall
be
carefully
look
to
,
and
in
more
than
one
instance
,
but
they
be
find
dangerous
,
what
be
remain
;
some
part
have
be
so
completely
destroy
,
that
there
be
nothing
but
heap
of
rubbish
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
curiosity
be
exert
to
such
an
extraordinary
pitch
that
it
overcome
the
fear
of
danger
,
in
search
of
the
horrible
;
for
they
believe
that
if
there
be
any
one
in
the
ruin
he
must
be
a
vampyre
,
of
course
,
and
they
be
somewhat
cautious
in
go
near
such
a
creature
,
lest
in
so
do
they
should
meet
with
some
accident
,
and
become
vampyre
too
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
dreadful
reflection
,
and
one
that
every
now
and
then
impress
itself
upon
the
individual
compose
the
mob
;
but
at
the
same
time
any
new
impulse
,
or
a
shout
,
and
they
immediately
become
insensible
to
all
fear
;
the
mere
impulse
be
the
dominant
one
,
and
then
all
be
forget
.
 
<EOS>
the
scene
be
an
impressive
one
;
the
beautiful
house
and
ground
look
desolate
and
drear
;
many
of
the
tree
be
strip
and
break
down
,
and
many
scorched
and
burn
,
while
the
gardens
and
flower
bed
,
the
delight
of
the
Bannerworth
family
,
be
rudely
trodden
under
foot
by
the
rabble
,
and
all
those
little
beauty
so
much
admired
and
tend
by
the
inhabitant
,
be
now
utterly
destroy
,
and
in
such
a
state
that
their
site
could
not
even
be
detect
by
the
former
owner
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
sad
sight
to
see
such
a
sacrilege
committed,--such
violence
do
to
private
feeling
,
as
to
have
all
these
place
throw
open
to
the
scrutiny
of
the
brutal
and
vulgar
,
who
be
incapable
of
appreciate
or
understand
the
pleasure
of
a
refined
taste
.
 
<EOS>
the
ruin
present
a
remarkable
contrast
to
what
the
place
have
be
but
a
very
short
time
before
;
and
now
the
scene
of
desolation
be
complete
,
there
be
no
one
spot
in
which
the
most
wretched
could
find
shelter
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
under
the
lee
of
some
break
and
crumble
wall
,
that
totter
,
rather
than
stand
,
a
huddle
wretch
may
have
find
shelter
from
the
wind
,
but
it
would
have
be
at
the
risk
of
his
life
,
and
not
there
complete
.
 
<EOS>
the
mob
become
quiet
for
some
moment
,
but
be
not
so
long
;
indeed
,
a
mob
of
people,--which
be
,
in
fact
,
always
compose
of
the
most
disorderly
character
to
be
find
in
a
place
,
be
not
exactly
the
assembly
that
be
most
calculated
for
quietness
;
somebody
give
a
shout
,
and
then
somebody
else
shout
,
and
the
one
wide
throat
of
the
whole
concourse
be
open
,
and
send
forth
a
mighty
yell
.
 
<EOS>
after
this
exhibition
of
power
,
they
begin
to
run
about
like
mad,--traverse
the
ground
from
one
end
to
the
other
,
and
then
the
ruin
be
in
progress
of
be
explore
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
tender
affair
,
and
have
to
be
do
with
some
care
and
caution
by
those
who
be
so
engaged
;
and
they
walk
over
crumble
and
decayed
masse
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
or
two
place
,
they
see
what
appear
to
be
large
hole
,
into
which
the
building
material
have
be
sink
,
by
their
own
weight
,
through
the
flooring
,
that
seem
as
roof
to
some
cellar
or
dungeon
.
 
<EOS>
see
this
,
they
know
not
how
soon
some
other
part
may
sink
in
,
and
carry
their
precious
body
down
with
the
mass
of
rubbish
;
this
give
an
interest
to
the
scene,--a
little
danger
<EOS>
be
a
sort
of
salt
to
an
adventure
,
and
enable
those
who
have
take
part
in
it
to
talk
of
their
exploit
,
and
of
their
danger
,
which
be
pleasant
to
do
,
and
to
hear
in
the
ale
-
house
,
and
by
the
inglenook
in
the
winter
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
when
a
few
have
go
some
distance
,
other
follow
,
when
they
see
them
enter
the
place
in
safety
:
and
at
length
the
whole
ruin
be
cover
with
live
man
,
and
not
a
few
woman
,
who
seem
necessary
to
make
up
the
element
of
mischief
in
this
case
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
some
shouting
and
halloo
from
one
to
the
other
as
they
hurry
about
the
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
they
have
explore
the
ruin
nearly
all
over
,
when
one
man
,
who
have
stand
a
few
minute
upon
a
spot
,
gaze
intently
upon
something
,
suddenly
exclaimed,--
 
<EOS>
"
Hilloa
!
<EOS>
hurrah
!
<EOS>
here
we
be
,
altogether,--come
on,--I've
find
him,--i've
find
--
recollect
it
be
me
,
and
nobody
else
have
found,--hurrah
!
"
 
<EOS>
then
,
with
a
wild
kind
of
frenzy
,
he
throw
his
hat
up
into
the
air
,
as
if
to
attract
attention
,
and

this

nobody

the

there
be
a
feeling

creep
over
the

I
tell

<EOS>
there
be
a
pause
for
a
few
moment
,
and
then
one
man
more
adventurous
than
the
rest
,
exclaimed,--
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
vampyre
,

no
vampyre

his

can
harm
no

<EOS>
"
Hurrah

<EOS>
shout
three

four
more

as
they
jump
down
into
the
hole
form
by
the
falling
in
of
the
material
which
have
crush
Marchdale
to
death
,
for
it
be
his
body
they
have
discover
.
 
<EOS>
They
immediately
set
to
work
to
displace
such
of
the
material
as
lie
on
the
body
,
and
then
,
have
clear
it
of
all
superincumbent
rubbish

they
proceed
to
lift

up

find
that
it

entangle

call
it

a

run
a
stake
through

place
him
upon
some
dry
wood,--there

plenty

I
be
sure,--and
then
burn
him
to
a
cinder

nothing

life

that
,
I
should
say

<EOS>
"
 
there
may
be
something
in
that
,
and
the
mob
shout
its
approbation
,
as
it
be
sure
to
do
as
anything
stupid
or
senseless
,
and
the
proposal
may
be
say
to
have
be
carry
by
acclamation
,
and
it
require
only
the
execution
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
soon
do
.
<EOS>
there
be
plenty
of
lath
and
rafter
,
and
the
adjoin
wood
furnish
an
abundant
supply
of
dry
stick
,
so
there
be
no
want
of
fuel
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
loud
shout
as
each
accession
of
stick
take
place
,
and
,
as
each
individual
throw
his
bundle
into
the
heap
,
each
man
feel
all
the
self
-
devotion
to
the
task
as
the
scottish
chieftain
who
sacrifice
himself
and
seven
son
in
the
battle
for
his
superior
;
and
,
when
one
son
be
cut
down
,
the
man
fill
up
his
place
with
the
exclamation,--"Another
for
Hector
,
"
until
he
himself
fall
as
the
last
of
his
race
.
 
<EOS>
soon
now
the
heap
become
prodigious
,
and
it
require
an
effort
to
get
the
mangle
corpse
upon
this
funeral
bier
;
but
it
be
then
a
shout
from
the
mob
that
rent
the
air
announce
,
both
the
fact
and
their
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
thing
to
be
do
be
to
light
the
pile
--
this
be
no
easy
task
;
but
like
all
other
,
it
be
accomplish
,
and
the
dead
body
of
the
vampyre
's
victim
be
throw
on
to
prevent
that
become
a
vampyre
too
,
in
its
turn
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
,
boy
,
"
say
one
,
"
he
will
not
see
the
moonlight

,
that
be
certain
,
and
the
sooner
we
put
a
light
to
this
the
well
;
for
it
may
be
,
the
soldier
will
be
down
upon
us
before
we
know
anything
of
it
;
so
now
,
who
be
get
a
light
?
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
question
that
require
a
deal
of
searching
;
but
,
at
length
one
be
find
by
one
of
the
mob
come
forward
,
and
after
draw
his
pipe
vigorously
for
some
moment
,
he
collect
some
scrap
of
paper
upon
which
he
empty
the
content
of
the
pipe
,
with
the
hope
they
would
take
fire
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
,
however
,
he
be
doom
to
disappointment
;
for
it
produce
nothing
but
a
deal
of
smoke
,
and
the
paper
burn
without
produce
any
flame
.
 
<EOS>
this
act
of
disinterestedness
,
however
be
not
without
its
due
consequence
,
for
there
be
several
who
have
pipe
,
and
,
fire
with
the
hope
of
emulate
the
first
projector
of
the
scheme
for
raise
the
flame
,
they
join
together
,
and
pot
the
content
of
their
pipe
together
on
some
paper
,
straw
,
and
chip
,
they
produce
,
after
some
little
trouble
,
a
flame
.
 
<EOS>
then
there
be
a
shout
,
and
the
burn
mass
be
then
place
in
a
favourable
position
nearer
the
pile
of
material
collect
for
burn
,
and
then
,
in
a
few
moment
,
it
begin
to
take
light
;
one
piece
communicate
the
fire
to
another
,
until
the
whole
be
in
a
blaze
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
first
flame
fairly
reach
the
top
,
a
loud
and
tremendous
shout
arise
from
the
mob
,
and
the
very
welkin
re
-
echo
with
its
fulness
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
fork
flame
rush
through
the
wood
,
and
hiss
and
crackle
as
they
fly
,
throw
up
huge
masse
of
black
smoke
,
and
cast
a
peculiar
reflection
around
.
<EOS>
not
a
sound
be
hear
save
the
hissing
and
roaring
of
the
flame
,
which
seem
like
the
approaching
of
a
furious
whirlwind
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
there
be
nothing
to
be
see
but
the
blacken
mass
;
it
be
envelop
in
one
huge
flame
,
that
throw
out
a
great
heat
,
so
much
so
,
that
those
near
to
it
feel
induce
to
retire
from
before
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
reckon
,
"
say
one
,
"
that
he
be
pretty
well
do
by
this
time

he

have
a
warm

<EOS>
"
yes

"
farmer

home

not
such

there

it

answer
another

there

joking
go
on
among
the

stand
around

in

which
,
however
,
they
be
disturb
by
a
loud
shout

upon
look
in
the
quarter
whence
<EOS>
it
come
,
they
see
steal
from
among
the
ruin
,
the
form
of
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
strange
,
odd
looking
man
,
and
at
the
time
it
be
very
doubtful
among
the
mob
as
to
whom
it
be
--
nobody
could
tell
,
and
more
than
one
look
at
the
burn
pile
,
and
then
at
the
man
who
seem
to
be
so
mysteriously
present
,
as
if
they
almost
imagine
that
the
body
have
get
away

"
who
be
it
?
<EOS>
"
exclaim
one

<EOS>
"
dange
if
I
know
,
"
say
another
,
look
very
hard
,
and
very
white
at
the
same
time;--"i
hope
it
be
not
the
chap

what
we
have
burn
here
jist
now

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
the
female
,
"
that
you
may
be
sure
of
,
for
he
be
have
a
stake
through
his
body
,
and
as
you
say
,
he
can
never
get
over
that
,
for
as
the
stake
be
consume
,
so
be
his
vital
,

that
be
a
sure
sign
he
be
do
for

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
she
be
right
--
a
vampyre
may
live
upon
blood
,
but
can
not
do
without
his
inside
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
so
obvious
to
them
all
,
that
it
be
at
once
concede
,
and
a
general
impression
pervade
the
mob
that
it
may
be
Sir
Francis
Varney
:
<EOS>
a
shout
ensue
.
 
<EOS>
"
hurrah!--aft
him
<EOS>

there
be
a
vampyre
--
there
he
goes!--after
him
--
catch
him
--
burn
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
a
variety
of
other
exclamation
be
utter
,
at
the
same
time
;
the
victim
of
popular
wrath
seem
to
be
aware
that
he
be
now
discover
,
and
make
off
with
all
possible
expedition
,
towards
some
wood
.
 
<EOS>
away
go
the
mob
in
pursuit
,
hooting
and
halloo
like
demon
,
and
denounce
the
unfortunate
be
with
all
the
terror
that
could
be
imagine
,
and
which
naturally
add
great
speed
to
the
unfortunate
man
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
some
among
the
mob
,
see
that
there
be
every
probability
of
the
stranger
's
escape
at
a
mere
match
of
speed
,
bring
a
little
cunning
to
bear
upon
matter
,
and
take
a
circuit
round
,
and
thus
intercept
him
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
not
accomplish
without
a
desperate
effort
,

by
the
good
runner
,
who
thus
reach
the
spot
he
make
for
,
before
he
could
get
there
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
stranger
see
himself
thus
intercept
,
he
endeavour
to
fly
in
a
different
direction
;
but
be
soon
secure
by
the
mob
,
who
make
somewhat
free
with
his
person
,
and
commence
knock
him
about
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
mercy
on
me

the
stranger

"
what

take
all
I

"
what
do
you
do

twenty
voice

quite
a

"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes

he
be
a
stranger

that
be
all
the
bad
for
him

he
be
a

there
be
no

about
that

be

of

not

send

take

to
the
fire

<EOS>
"
ay
,
and
run
a
stake
through
his
body
,

then
he
be
safe
for
life

<EOS>
I
be
sure
he
have
something
to
do
with
the
vampyre
;

who
know
,
if
he
be
not
a

,
how
soon
he
may
become
one

"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
that
be
very
true
;
bring
him
back
to
the
fire

we
will
try
the
effect
of
the
fire
upon
his
constitution

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
,
neighbour

it
be
my
opinion

that
as
one
fool
make
many

so
one
vampyre
make
many
.

<EOS>
"
so
it
do
,
so
it
do

there
be
much
truth

reason
in
that
neighbour

I
be
decidedly
of
that
opinion

too

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
come
along
then
,
"
cry
the
mob
,
cuff
and
pull
the
unfortunate
stranger
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
mercy
,
mercy
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
useless
to
call
for
mercy
to
man
whose
superstitious
feeling
urge
them
on
;
for
when
the
demon
of
superstition
be
active

no

what
form
it
may
take
,

They

a

odd

They

heavy
blow
from

fearful

to
the

Bannerworth

who
together
with
Admiral
Bell

still
hold
watch
over
the
hall

<EOS>
no

of
the
come

of
Varney
present
itself
for
some
time
longer
,
and
then
,
at
least
they
think
,
they
hear
a
window
open
;
and
,
turn
their
eye
in
the
direction
<EOS>
whence
the
sound
proceed
<EOS>
,
they
could
see
the
form
of
a
man
slowly
and
cautiously
emerge
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
as
far
as
they
could
judge
,
from
the
distance
at
which
they
be

that
form
partake
much
of
the
appearance
and
the
general
aspect
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
and
the
more
they
look
and
notice
its
movement
,
the
more
they
feel
convinced
that
such
be
the
fact

<EOS>
"

the

He

Dr.

<EOS>
believe
me
,
I
have
the
very
strong
reason
for

so

<EOS>
"
He

Henry

Henry

with
the
most
imperturbable
coolness
in

Sir
Francis
Varney
turn
upon

replied,--

pray
,
Henry
Bannerworth
,
what
have
I
do
to
provoke
your
wrath

what

you
done?--have
you

Can
you
ask
what
you
have
do

"
 
<EOS>
"
ay

"
say
the
vampyre
,
"
like
a
thief
,
perchance
,
and
yet
no

<EOS>
May
I
ask
you
,
what
there
be
to
steal
,
in
the
house
?
"
 
<EOS>
by
the
time
this
short
dialogue
have
be
utter

the
rest

party
have
come
up

Varney

so
far
as
regard
number

a

<EOS>
"
well

gentleman

he
say
,
with
that
strange
contortion
of
countenance
which
,
now
they
all
understand

arise
from
the
fact
of
his
have
be
hang

<EOS>
well

now
that

me
in

a
way

may
I
ask

<EOS>
"
if
you
will
step
aside

Sir

for
a

"

Dr.
Chillingworth
,
"
I
will
make
to

a

<EOS>
"
oh

"
I

still

I
have
no

hear
what

have
to

"
 
<EOS>
He
step
a
few
pace
on
one
side
with
the
doctor
,
while
the
other
wait
,
not
without
some
amount
of
impatience
for
the

the
communication

<EOS>
all
that
they
could
hear
be
,
that
Varney
say
,
suddenly--
 
<EOS>
"
You

quite
mistaken

<EOS>
and
then
the

appear
to
be
insist
upon
something

which
the
vampyre
listen
to
patiently

,
at
the
end
,
burst
out
with,--
 
<EOS>
"
why

you

"
 
<EOS>
at
this
,
Dr.
Chillingworth
at
once
leave
him
,
and
advance
to
his
friend
,
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
Francis
Varney
deny
in
toto
all
that
I
have
relate
to
you
concern
him
;
therefore
,
I
can
say
no
more
than
that
I
earnestly
recommend
you
,
before
you
let
him
go
,
to
see
that
he
take
nothing
of
value
with
him

<EOS>
"

"

what
can

"

<EOS>
"

the

;
"
I
will
tell

very
shortly

<EOS>
"
indeed
--
indeed

say
Sir

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
now
,
gentleman
,
I
will
give
you
a
chance
of
behave
justly
and
quietly
,
so
save
yourself
the
danger
of
act
otherwise
.
<EOS>
I
have
make
repeat
offer
to
take
this
house
,
either
as
a
tenant
or
as
a
purchaser
,
all
of
which
offer
have
be
decline
,
upon
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
a
common
enough
principle
,
namely
,
one
which
induce
people
to
enhance
the
value
of
anything
they
have
for
disposal
,
if
it
be
unique
,
by
make
it
difficult
to
come
at
.
<EOS>
see
that
you
have
desert
the
place
,
I
could
make
no
doubt
but
that
it
be
to
be
have
,
so
I
come
here
to
make
a
thorough
examination
of
its
interior
,
to
see
if
it
would
suit
me
.
<EOS>
I
find
that
it
will
not
;
therefore
,
I
have
only
to
apologise
for
the
intrusion
,
and
to
wish
you
a
remarkably
good
evening
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
will
not
do
,
"
say
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
will
not
do
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
this
excuse
will
not
do

Sir
Francis
Varney
.
<EOS>
You
be
,
although
you
deny
it
,
the
man
who
be
hang
in
London
some
year
ago
for
a
highway
robbery
.
"
 
<EOS>
Varney
laugh
,
and
hold
up
his
hand
,
exclaiming,--
 
<EOS>
"
alas
!
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
our
good
friend
,
the
doctor

have
study
too
hard
;
his
wit
,
probably
,
at
the
good
of
time
,
none
of

clear
,
have
become
hopelessly
entangled

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
deny

say
Henry

"
then
,
that
you
be
that
man

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
most
unequivocally

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
assert
it
,
"
say
the
doctor

"
and
now
,
I
will
tell
you
all
,
for
I
perceive
you
hesitate
about
search
<EOS>
,
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
I
tell
you
all
why
it
be
that
he
have
such
an
affection
for
Bannerworth
Hall

"
 
<EOS>
"
before
you
do
,
"
say
Varney
,
"
there
be
a
pill
for
you

which
you
may
find
more
nauseous

hard

any
your

furnish

<EOS>
as
Varney
utter
these
word
,
he
suddenly
draw
from
his
pocket
a
pistol
,
and
,
level
it
at
the
unfortunate
doctor

he
fire
it
full
at
him

<EOS>
the
act
be
so
sudden

so

unexpected

so
stunning

it

Henry
Bannerworth

unhappily

us
possible
,
make
towards
him
,
they
knock
down
the
admiral
,
who
impede
them
much
;
and
,
before
they
could
spring
over
,
or
past
him
,
Sir
Francis
Varney
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
so
sudden
,
too
,
have
be
his
departure
,
that
they
have
not
the
least
idea
in
which
direction
he
have
go
;
<EOS>
so
that
to
follow
him
would
have
be
a
work
of
the
great
possible
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
,
however
,
both
the
difficulty
and
the
danger
,
for
no
doubt
the
vampyre
be
well
enough
arm
,
Henry
and
his
brother
both
<EOS>
rush
after
the
murderer
,
as
they
now
believe
him
to
be
,
in
the
route
which
they
think
it
be
most
probable
he
would
take
,
namely
,
that
which
lead
towards
the
garden
gate
.
 
<EOS>
They
reach
that
spot
in
a
few
moment
,
but
all
be
profoundly
still
.
<EOS>
not
the
least
trace
of
any
one
could
be
see
,
high
or
low
,
and
they
be
compel
,
after
a
cursory
examination
,
to
admit
that
Sir
Francis
Varney
have
again
make
his
escape
,
despite
the
great
odd
that
be
against
him
in
point
of
number
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
have
go
,
"
say
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
let
us
go
back
,
and
see
into
the
state
of
poor
Dr.
Chillingworth
,
who
,
I
fear
,
be
a
dead
man
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
hurry
back
to
the
spot
,
and
there
they
find
the
admiral
look
as
compose
as
possible
,
and
solace
himself
with
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
as
he
gaze
upon
the
apparently
lifeless
form
at
his
foot
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
he
dead
?
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
he
be
,
"
reply
the
admiral
;
"
such
a
shot
as
that
be
do
not
want
to
be
repeat
.
<EOS>
well
,
I
like
the
doctor
with
all
his
fault
.
<EOS>
He
only
have
one
foolish
way
with
him
,
and
that
be
,
that
he
shirk
his
grog
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
an
awful
catastrophe
,
"
say
Henry
,
as
he
kneel
down
by
the
side
of
the
body
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
assist
me
,
some
of
you
.
<EOS>
where
be
Charles
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
hang
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
"
if
I
know
.
<EOS>
He
disappear
somewhere
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
night
of
mystery
as
well
as
terror
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
poor
Dr.
Chillingworth
!
<EOS>
I
little
think
that
you
would
have
fall
a
victim
to
the
man
whom
you
preserve
from
death
.
<EOS>
how
strange
it
be
that
you
should
have
snatch
from
the
tomb
the
very
individual
who
be
,
eventually
,
to
take
your
own
life
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
brother
gently
raise
the
body
of
the
doctor
,
and
carry
it
on
to
the
glass
plot
,
which
be
close
at
hand

<EOS>
"
farewell
,
kind

honest
-
hearted
Chillingworth

"
say
Henry
;
"
I
shall
,
many
and
many
a
time
,
feel
your
loss
;
and
now
I
will
rest
not
until
I
have
deliver
up
to
justice
your
murderer

<EOS>
all
consideration
,
or
feeling
,
for
what
seem
to
be
latent
virtue
in
that
strange
and
inexplicable
man
,
Varney
,
shall
vanish
,
and
he
shall
reap
the
consequence
of
the
crime
he
have
now
commit
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
cold
blooded
,
cowardly
murder
,
"
say
his
brother
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
;
but
you
may
depend
the
doctor
be
about
to
reveal
something
to
us
,
which
Varney
so
much
dreaded
,
that
he
take
his
life
as
the
only
effectual
way

at
the
moment

of
stop
him

"
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
so
,
"

Henry

<EOS>
"

now
,

the

,
"
it
be

late

we
shall
not

that
be
the
way

a
fellow
save
up
what
he

get
to
tell

it

down

"
 
<EOS>
"
not

Dr.
Chillingworth

suddenly
sit

upright--"not

"
 
<EOS>
Henry
and
his

start
back
in
amazement
,

the
admiral
be
so
take
by
surprise
,
that
have
not
the
resuscitated
doctor
suddenly
stretch
out
his
hand
and
lay
hold
of
him
by
the
ankle

he
would
have
make

me
go

how
do
I
know
<EOS>
but
you
may
be
a
vampyre
by
now
,
as
you
be
shoot
by
one

"
 
<EOS>
Henry
soonest
recover
from
the
surprise
of
the
moment
,
and
with
the
most
unfeigned
satisfaction
,
he
cried,--
 
<EOS>
"
thank
God
you
be
unhurt
,
Dr.
Chillingworth

why
he
must
have
miss
you

not

"

me
up

all
right

I
be
only
a
little
singed
about
the
whisker

He
hit
me
safe
enough
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
how
have
you
escape
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
from
the
want
of
a
bullet
in
the
pistol
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
I
can
understand
it
all
well
enough
.
<EOS>
He
want
to
create
sufficient
confusion
to
cover
a
desperate
attempt
to
escape
,

he
think
that
would
be
best
do
by
seem

shoot
me
.
<EOS>
the
suddenness
of
the
shock
,
and
the
full
belief
,
at
the
moment
,
that
he
have
send
a
bullet
into
my
brain
,
make
me
fall
,

produce
a
temporary
confusion
of
idea

amount
to
insensibility

<EOS>

from
which
you
be
happily
recover

<EOS>
thank
Heaven
that
,
after
all

he
be
not

a
villain

this
act
would
have
make
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
admiral
,
"
it
take
people
who
have
live

know

you
not

so

admiral

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

what
be

<EOS>
I
think
the
doctor
may
be
amuse
to
know
what
you
should
say
of
him
,
<EOS>
so
you
see
I
do
not
interfere
;
and
,
as
I
be
not
a
good
hand
at
gallop
after
anybody
,
I
do
not
try
that
part

just
remain
where
I
be

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
alas
!
alas
!
<EOS>
"
cry
the
doctor
,
"
I
much
fear

I
have
lose
all

<EOS>
It
be
of
not

use
now
tell
you

trouble
you
about

<EOS>
You
may
now
sell

let
Bannerworth
Hall
to
whomever
you

for
I
be
afraid
it
be
really
worthless

"
 
<EOS>
"
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
?
"
say
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
doctor
,
will
you
keep
up
this
mystery
among
us
?
<EOS>
if
you
have
anything
to
say
,
why
not
say
it
at
once
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
because
,
I
tell
you
it
be
of
no
use
now

<EOS>
the
game
be
up
,
Sir
Francis
Varney
have
escape
;

still
I
do
not

I
need
exactly
hesitate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
can
be
no
reason
for
your
hesitating
about
make
a
communication
to
us
,
"
say
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
unfriendly
not
to
do
so
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
boy
,
you
will
excuse
me
for
say
that
you
do
not

what
you
be
talk
about

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Can
you
give
any
reason
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
respect
for
the
living
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
to
relate
something
of
the
dead
which
would
be
hurtful
to
their
feeling
.
"
 
<EOS>
Henry
be
silent
for
a
few
moment
,
and
then
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
what
dead
?
<EOS>
and
who
be
the
living
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
another
time
,
"
whisper
the
doctor
to
him
;
"
another
time
,
Henry
.
<EOS>
do
not
press
me
now
.
<EOS>
but
you
shall
know
all
another
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
be
content
.
<EOS>
but
now
let
us
remember
that
another
man
yet
linger
in
Bannerworth
Hall
.
<EOS>
I
will
endure
suspense
on
his
account
no
longer
.
<EOS>
He
be
an
intruder
there
;
so
I
go
at
once
to
dislodge
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
no
one
make
any
opposition
to
this
move
,
not
even
the
doctor
;
so
Henry
precede
them
all
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
They
pass
through
the
open
window
into
the
long
hall
,
and
from
thence
into
every
apartment
of
the
mansion
,
without
find
the
object
of
their
search
.
<EOS>
but
from
one
of
the
window
up
to
which
there
grow
great
masse
of
ivy
,
there
hang
a
rope
,
by
which
any
one
may
easily
have
let
himself
down
;
and
no
doubt
,
therefore
,
exist
in
all
their
mind
that
the
hangman
have
sufficiently
profit
by
the
confusion
incidental
to
the
suppose
shooting
of
the
doctor
,
to
make
good
his
escape
from
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
so
,
after
all
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
we
be
completely
foil
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
may
be
,
"
say
Dr.
Chillingworth
;
"
but
it
be
,
perhaps
,
go
too
far
to
say
that
we
actually
be
.
<EOS>
one
thing
,
however
,
be
quite
clear
;
and
that
is
,
no
good
can
be
do
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
let
us
go
home
,
"
say
the
admiral
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
from
the
first
that
any
good
would
be
do
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
all
leave
the
garden
together
now
;
so
that
almost
for
the
first
time
,
Bannerworth
Hall
be
leave
to
itself
,
unguarded
and
unwatched
by
any
one
whatever
.
<EOS>
It
be
with
an
evident
and
a
marked
melancholy
that
the
doctor
proceed
with
the
party
to
the
cottage
-
house
of
the
Bannerworths
;
but
,
as
after
what
he
have
say
,
Henry
forbore
to
question
him
further
upon
those
subject
which
he
admit
he
be
keep
secret
;
and
as
none
of
the
party
be
much
in
a
cue
for
general
conversation
,
the
whole
of
them
walk
on
with
more
silence
than
usually
characterise
them

CHAPTER
LXXXII
.
 
<EOS>
CHARLES
HOLLAND
's
pursuit
of
the
vampyre.--the
DANGEROUS
INTERVIEW
.
  
<EOS>
[
illustration
]
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
recollect
that
the
admiral
have
make
a
remark
about
Charles
Holland
have
suddenly
disappear
;
and
it
be
for
us
now
to
account
for
that
disappearance
and
to
follow
him
to
the
pathway
he
have
choose
.
 
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
that
he
,
when
Varney
fire
the
shot
at
the
doctor
,
or
what
be
the
suppose
shot
,
be
the
farth
from
the
vampyre
;
and
he
,
on
that
very
account
,
have
the
clear
and
good
opportunity
of
mark
which
route
he
take
when
he
have
discharge
the
pistol
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
confuse
by
the
smoke
,
as
the
other
be
;
nor
be
he
stun
by
the
noise
of
the
discharge
;
but
he
distinctly
see
Varney
dart
across
one
of
the
garden
bed
,
and
make
for
the
summer
-
house
,
instead
of
for
the
garden
gate
,
as
Henry
have
suppose
be
the
most
probable
path
he
have
choose
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
Charles
Holland
either
have
an
inclination
,
for
some
reason
of
his
own
,
to
follow
the
vampyre
alone
;
or
,
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
,
he
have
not
time
to
give
an
alarm
to
the
other
;
but
certain
it
be
that
he
do
,
unaided
,
rush
after
him
.
<EOS>
He
see
him
enter
the
summer
-
house
,
and
pass
out
of
it
again
at
the
back
portion
of
it
,
as
he
have
once
before
do
,
when
surprise
in
his
interview
with
Flora
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
vampyre
do
not
now
,
as
he
have
do
on
the
former
occasion
,
hide
immediately
behind
the
summer
-
house
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
be
well
aware
that
that
expedient
would
not
answer
twice
;
so
he
at
once
speed
onwards
,
clear
the
garden
fence
,
and
take
to
the
meadow
.
 
<EOS>
It
form
evidently
no
part
of
the
intention
of
Charles
Holland
to
come
up
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
resolve
upon
dog
his
footstep
,
to
know
where
he
should
go
;
so
that
he
may
have
a
knowledge
of
his
hiding
-
place
,
if
he
have
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
and
will
,
"
say
Charles
to
himself
,
"
penetrate
the
mystery
that
hang
about
this
most
strange
and
inexplicable
being
.
<EOS>
I
will
have
an
interview
with
him
,
not
in
hostility
,
for
I
forgive
him
the
evil
he
have
do
me
,
but
with
a
kindly
spirit
;
and
I
will
ask
him
to
confide
in
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
Charles
,
therefore
,
do
not
keep
so
close
upon
the
heel
of
the
vampyre
as
to
excite
any
suspicion
of
his
intention
to
follow
him
;
but
he
wait
by
the
garden
pale
long
enough
not
only
for
Varney
to
get
some
distance
off
,
but
long
enough
likewise
to
know
that
the
pistol
which
have
be
fire
at
the
doctor
have
produce
no
real
bad
effect
,
except
singe
some
curious
tuft
of
hair
upon
the
side
of
his
face
,
which
the
doctor
be
pleased
to
call
whisker
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
as
much
,
"
be
Charles
's
exclamation
when
he
hear
the
doctor
's
voice
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
have
be
strikingly
at
variance
with
all
Varney
's
other
conduct
,
if
he
have
commit
such
a
deliberate
and
heartless
murder
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
,
as
the
form
of
the
vampyre
could
be
but
dimly
see
,
Charles
run
on
for
some
distance
in
the
direction
he
have
take
,
and
then
pause
again
;
so
that
if
Varney
hear
the
sound
of
footstep
,
and
pause
to
listen
they
have
cease
again
probably
,
and
nothing
be
discernible
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
manner
he
follow
the
mysterious
individual
,
if
we
may
really
call
him
such
,
for
above
a
mile
;
and
then
Varney
make
a
rapid
detour
,
and
take
his
way
towards
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
onwards
with
wonderful
precision
now
in
a
right
line
,
not
stop
at
any
obstruction
,
in
the
way
of
fence
,
hedge
,
or
ditch
,
so
that
it
take
Charles
some
exertion
,
to
which
,
just
then
,
he
be
scarcely
equal
,
to
keep
up
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
the
outskirt
of
the
town
be
gain
,
and
then
Varney
pause
,
and
look
around
him
,
scarcely
allow
Charles
,
who
be
now
close
to
him
than
he
have
be
,
time
to
hide
himself
from
observation
,
which
,
however
,
he
do
accomplish
,
by
cast
himself
suddenly
upon
the
ground
,
so
that
he
could
not
be
detect
against
the
sky
,
which
then
form
a
back
ground
to
the
spot
where
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
apparently
satisfy
that
he
have
completely
now
elude
the
pursuit
,
<EOS>
if
any
have
be
attempt
,
of
those
whom
he
have
lead
in
such
a
state
of
confusion
,
the
vampyre
walk
hastily
towards
a
house
that
be
to
let
,
and
which
be
only
to
be
reach
by
go
up
an
avenue
of
tree
,
and
then
unlock
a
gate
in
a
wall
which
bound
the
premise
next
to
the
avenue
.
<EOS>
but
the
vampyre
appear
to
be
possess
of
every
facility
for
effect
an
entrance
to
the
place
and
,
produce
from
his
pocket
a
key
,
he
at
once
open
the
gate
,
and
disappear
within
the
precinct
of
those
premise
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
no
doubt
,
feel
that
he
be
hunt
by
the
mob
of
the
town
,
and
hence
his
frequent
change
of
residence
,
since
his
own
have
be
burn
down
,
and
,
indeed
,
situate
as
he
be
,
there
can
be
no
manner
of
doubt
that
he
would
have
be
sacrifice
to
the
superstitious
fury
of
the
populace
,
if
they
could
but
have
get
hold
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
,
from
his
knowledge
,
which
be
no
doubt
accurate
and
complete
,
of
what
have
be
do
,
a
good
idea
of
what
his
own
fate
would
be
,
be
he
to
fall
into
the
hand
of
that
ferocious
multitude
,
each
individual
composing
which
<EOS>
,
feel
a
conviction
that
there
would
be
no
peace
,
nor
hope
of
prosperity
or
happiness
,
on
the
place
,
until
he
,
the
arch
vampyre
of
all
the
suppose
vampyre
,
be
destroy
.
 
<EOS>
[

Charles
do
pause
for
a
few
moment
,
after
have
thus
become
rouse
,
to
consider
whether
he
should
then
attempt
to
have
the
interview
he
have
resolve
upon
have
by
some
mean
or
another
,
or
defer
it
,
now
that
he
know
where
Varney
be
to
be
find
,
until
another
time
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
he
come
to
consider
how
extremely
likely
it
be
that
,
even
in
the
course
of
a
few
hour
,
Varney
may
shift
his
abode
for
some
good
and
substantial
reason
,
he
at
once
determine
upon
attempt
to
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
how
to
accomplish
such
a
purpose
be
not
the
easy
question
in
the
world
to
answer
.
<EOS>
if
he
ring
the
bell
that
present
itself
above
the
garden
gate
,
be
it
at
all
likely
that
Varney
,
who
have
come
there
for
concealment
,
would
pay
any
attention
to
the
summon
?
 
<EOS>
after
some
consideration
,
he
do
,
however
,
think
of
a
plan
by
which
,
at
all
event
,
he
could
ensure
effect
an
entrance
into
the
premise
,
and
then
he
would
take
his
chance
of
find
the
mysterious
being
whom
he
seek
,
and
who
probably
may
have
no
particular
objection
to
meet
with
him
,
Charles
Holland
,
because
their
last
interview
in
the
ruin
could
not
be
say
to
be
otherwise
than
of
a
peaceable
and
calm
enough
character
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
by
the
board
,
which
be
nail
in
the
front
of
the
house
,
that
all
application
to
see
it
be
to
be
make
to
a
Mr.
Nash
,
reside
close
at
hand
;
and
,
as
Charles
have
the
appearance
of
a
respectable
person
,
he
think
he
may
possibly
have
the
key
entrust
to
him
,
ostensibly
to
look
at
the
house
,
preparatory
possibly
to
take
it
,
and
so
he
should
,
at
all
event
,
obtain
admission
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
accordingly
,
go
at
once
to
this
Mr.
Nash
,
and
ask
about
the
house
;
of
course
he
have
to
affect
an
interest
in
its
rental
and
accommodation
,
which
he
do
not
feel
,
in
order
to
lull
any
suspicion
,
and
,
finally
,
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
look
over
it
if
you
will
lend
me
the
key
,
which
I
will
shortly
bring
back
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
evident
hesitation
about
the
agent
when
this
proposal
be
communicate
by
Charles
Holland
,
and
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
,
<EOS>
sir
,
you
wonder
that
I
do
not
say
yes
,
at
once
;
but
the
fact
be
there
come
a
gentleman
here
one
day
when
I
be
out
,
and
get
a
key
,
for
we
have
two
to
open
the
house
,
from
my
wife
,
and
he
never
come
back
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
that
this
be
the
mean
by
which
Varney
,
the
vampyre
,
have
obtain
the
key
,
by
the
aid
of
which
Charles
have
see
him
effect
<EOS>
so
immediate
an
entrance
to
the
house
,
there
could
be
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
long
ago
be
you
serve
that
trick
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
about
two
day
ago
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
it
only
show
how
,
when
one
person
act
wrongly
,
another
be
at
once
suspect
of
a
capability
to
do
so
likewise
.
<EOS>
there
be
my
name
and
my
address
;
I
should
like
rather
to
go
alone
to
see
the
house
,
because
I
always
fancy
<EOS>
I
can
judge
better
by
myself
of
the
accommodation
,
and
I
can
stay
as
long
as
I
like
,
and
ascertain
the
size
of
all
the
room
without
the
disagreeable
feeling
upon
my
mind
,
which
no
amount
of
complaisance
on
your
part
,
could
ever
get
me
over
,
that
I
be
most
unaccountably
detain
somebody
from
more
important
business
of
their
own
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
assure
you
,
sir
,
"
say
Mr.
Nash
,
"
that
I
should
not
be
at
all
impatient
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
would
rather
go
alone--
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
would
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
then
,
sir
,
there
be
the
key
.
<EOS>
a
gentleman
who
leave
his
name
and
address
,
of
course
,
we
can
have
no
objection
to
.
<EOS>
I
only
tell
you
of
what
happen
,
sir
,
in
the
mere
way
of
conversation
,
and
I
hope
you
will
not
imagine
for
a
moment
that
I
mean
to
insinuate
that
you
be
go
to
keep
the
key
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
certainly
not
--
certainly
not
,
"
say
Charles
,
who
be
only
too
glad
to
get
the
key
upon
any
term
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
quite
right
,
and
I
beg
you
will
say
no
more
about
it
;
I
quite
understand
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
walk
off
to
the
empty
house
again
,
and
,
proceed
to
the
avenue
<EOS>
,
he
fit
the
key
to
the
lock
,
and
have
the
satisfaction
of
find
the
gate
instantly
yield
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
pass
through
it
,
and
close
the
door
after
him
,
which
he
do
carefully
,
he
find
himself
in
a
handsomely
lay
-
out
garden
,
and
see
the
house
a
short
distance
in
front
of
him
,
stand
upon
a
well
get
-
up
lawn
.
 
<EOS>
He
care
not
if
Varney
should
see
him
before
he
reach
the
house
,
because
the
fact
be
sufficiently
evident
to
himself
that
after
all
he
could
not
actually
enforce
an
interview
with
the
vampyre
.
<EOS>
He
only
hope
that
as
he
have
find
him
out
it
would
be
concede
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
therefore
,
walk
up
the
lawn
without
make
the
least
attempt
at
concealment
,
and
when
he
reach
the
house
he
allow
his
footstep
to
make
what
noise
they
would
upon
the
stone
step
which
lead
up
to
it
.
<EOS>
but
no
one
appear
;
nor
be
there
,
either
by
sight
or
by
sound
,
any
indication
of
the
presence
of
any
live
be
in
the
place
besides
himself
.
 
<EOS>
insensibly
,
as
he
contemplate
the
deserted
place
around
him
,
the
solemn
sort
of
stillness
begin
to
have
its
effect
upon
his
imagination
,
and
,
without
be
aware
that
he
do
so
,
he
have
,
with
softness
and
caution
,
glide
onwards
,
as
if
he
be
bent
on
some
errand
require
the
utmost
amount
of
caution
and
discrimination
in
the
conduction
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
he
enter
the
hall
of
the
house
,
where
he
stand
some
time
,
and
listen
with
the
great
attention
,
without
,
however
,
be
able
to
hear
the
least
sound
throughout
the
whole
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
yet
he
must
be
here
,
"
think
Charles
to
himself
;
"
I
be
not
go
many
minute
,
and
it
be
extremely
unlikely
<EOS>
that
in
so
short
a
space
of
time
he
have
leave
,
after
take
so
much
trouble
,
by
make
such
a
detour
around
the
meadow
to
get
here
,
without
be
observe
.
<EOS>
I
will
examine
every
room
in
the
place
,
but
I
will
find
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
Charles
immediately
commence
go
from
room
to
room
of
that
house
in
his
search
for
the
vampyre
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
four
apartment
upon
the
ground
floor
,
and
these
,
of
course
,
he
quickly
run
through
.
<EOS>
nothing
whatever
at
all
indicative
of
any
one
have
be
there
meet
his
gaze
,
and
with
a
feeling
of
disappointment
creep
over
him
,
he
commence
the
ascent
of
the
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
have
now
fairly
commence
,
so
that
there
be
abundance
of
light
,
although
,
even
for
the
country
,
it
be
an
early
hour
,
and
probably
Mr.
Nash
have
be
not
a
little
surprised
to
have
a
call
from
one
whose
appearance
bespoke
no
necessity
for
rise
with
the
lark
at
such
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
all
these
consideration
,
however
,
sink
into
insignificance
in
Charles
's
mind
,
compare
with
the
object
he
have
in
view
,
namely
,
the
unravel
the
many
mystery
that
hang
around
that
man
.
<EOS>
He
ascend
to
the
landing
of
the
first
story
,
and
then
,
as
he
could
have
no
choice
,
he
open
the
first
door
that
his
eye
fall
upon
,
and
enter
a
tolerably
large
apartment
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
destitute
of
furniture
,
and
at
the
moment
Charles
be
about
to
pronounce
it
empty
;
but
then
his
eye
fall
upon
a
large
black
-
look
bundle
of
something
,
that
seem
to
be
lie
jam
up
under
the
window
on
the
floor
--
that
be
the
place
of
all
other
in
the
room
which
be
envelop
in
the
most
shadow
.
 
<EOS>
He
start
back
involuntarily
at
the
moment
,
for
the
appearance
be
one
so
shapeless
,
that
there
be
no
such
thing
as
define
,
from
even
that
distance
,
what
it
really
be
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
slowly
and
cautiously
approach
it
,
as
we
always
approach
that
of
the
character
of
which
we
be
ignorant
,
and
concern
the
power
of
which
to
do
injury
we
can
consequently
have
no
define
idea
.
 
<EOS>
that
it
be
a
human
form
there
,
be
the
first
tangible
opinion
he
have
about
it
;
and
from
its
profound
stillness
,
and
the
manner
in
which
it
seem
to
be
lay
close
under
the
window
,
he
think
that
he
be
surely
upon
the
point
of
find
out
that
some
deed
of
blood
have
be
commit
,
the
unfortunate
victim
of
which
be
now
lie
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
upon
a
near
examination
,
he
find
that
the
whole
body
,
include
the
great
part
of
the
head
and
face
,
be
wrap
in
a
large
cloak
;
and
there
,
as
he
gaze
,
he
soon
find
cause
to
correct
his
first
opinion
at
to
the
form
belong
to
the
dead
,
for
he
could
distinctly
hear
the
regular
breathing
,
as
of
some
one
in
a
sound
and
dreamless
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
closer
he
go
,
and
close
still
.
<EOS>
then
,
as
he
clasp
his
hand
,
he
say
,
in
a
voice
scarcely
above
a
whisper,--
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
--
it
be
the
vampyre
.
"
 
<EOS>
yes
,
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
the
fact
.
<EOS>
It
be
Sir
Francis
Varney
who
lie
there
,
envelop
in
the
huge
horseman
's
cloak
,
in
which
,
on
two
or
three
occasion
during
the
progress
of
this
narrative
,
he
have
figure
.
<EOS>
there
he
lie
,
at
the
mercy
completely
of
any
arm
that
may
be
raise
against
him
,
apparently
so
overcome
by
fatigue
that
no
ordinary
noise
would
have
awaken
him
.
 
<EOS>
well
may
Charles
Holland
gaze
at
him
with
mingled
feeling
.
<EOS>
there
lie
the
being
who
have
do
almost
enough
to
drive
the
beautiful
Flora
Bannerworth
distract
--
the
being
who
have
compel
the
Bannerworth
family
to
leave
their
ancient
house
,
to
which
they
have
be
bind
by
every
description
of
association
.
<EOS>
the
same
mysterious
existence
,
too
,
who
,
the
well
to
carry
on
his
plot
and
plan
,
have
,
by
dint
of
violence
,
immure
him
,
Charles
,
in
a
dungeon
,
and
load
him
with
chain
.
<EOS>
there
he
lie
sleep
,
and
at
his
mercy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
awaken
him
,
"
say
Charles
,
"
or
let
him
sleep
off
the
fatigue
,
which
,
no
doubt
,
be
weigh
down
his
limb
,
and
set
heavily
on
his
eyelid
.
<EOS>
no
,
my
business
with
him
be
too
urgent
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
raise
his
voice
,
and
cried,--
 
"
Varney
,
Varney
,
awake
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
sound
disturb
,
without
altogether
break
up
,
the
deep
slumber
of
the
vampyre
,
and
he
utter
a
low
moan
,
and
move
one
hand
restlessly
.
<EOS>
then
,
as
if
that
disturbance
of
the
calm
and
deep
repose
which
have
sit
upon
him
,
have
give
at
once
the
rein
to
fancy
,
he
begin
to
mutter
strange
word
in
his
sleep
,
some
of
which
could
be
hear
by
Charles
distinctly
,
while
other
be
too
incoherently
uttered
to
be
clearly
understand
.

listen
attentively

utter

aloud,--

,
as
before

the
sleep
man
be
sufficiently
deaf
to
the
cry
to
remain
,
with
his
eye
close
,
still
in
a
disturbed
slumber

yet
a
slumber

up

cast

sound
of

at

convince

of
his

it

with
a
voice
that

some
tone
of
regret
in

that
he
replied,--

during
the
long

weary
hour
of

I
think
deeply

painfully
too

as
may
be
well
imagine
,
of
all
the
circumstance
connect
with
your
appearance
at
Bannerworth
Hall
,

your

conduct

then
I
feel
convinced

there
be
something
far
more
than
meet
the
eye

in
the
whole
affair
,
and
,
from
what
I
have
be
inform
of
since
,
I
be
the
more
convinced
that
some
secret

some
mystery
,
which
it
be
in

perhaps
to
explain
,
lurk
at
the
bottom

enough

enable
you
to
divine
the
object

It
be
that
you
should
shake
off
the
trammel
of
mystery
in
which
you
have
shroud
yourself

declare
what
it

want

what

you

yourself
up

Your

Varney

it

He
stop
a

inquire
of
him
the

of
the
seeming
tumult

<EOS>
"
Bannerworth
Hall
!
<EOS>
you
must
be
mistake
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
I
ought
not
to
call
it
Bannerworth
Hall
,
because
I
mean
the
old
ruin
in
the
neighbourhood
that
be
suppose
to
have
be
originally
Bannerworth
Hall
before
the
house
now

such

build

moreover
,
as
the

Bannerworth
Hall

with
the
other

I

yes

,
what
be
more
,
a
man
have
be
kill
among
the
ruin

<EOS>
We
do
not
know
who
he
be
,
but
the
folk
say
he
be
a
vampyre
,
and
they
leave
him
for
dead

<EOS>

<EOS>
Varney

Varney

the
MYSTERIOUS
ARRIVAL
<EOS>
at
THE
INN.--THE
HUNGARIAN
NOBLEMAN.--THE
LETTER

[

<EOS>
while
these
affair
be
proceed
,
and
when
there
seem
every
appearance
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
himself
quickly
put
an
end
to
some
of
the
vexatious
circumstance
connect
with
himself
and
the
Bannerworth
family
,
it
be
necessary
that
we
should
notice
an
occurrence
which
take
place
at
the
same
inn
which
the
admiral
have
make
such
a
scene
of
confusion
upon
the
occasion
of
his
first
arrival
in
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
not
since
the
admiral
have
arrive
with
Jack
Pringle
,
and
so
disturb
the
whole
economy
of
the
household
,
be
there
so
much
curiosity
excite
as
on
the
morning
follow
the
interview
which
Charles
Holland
have
have
with
Varney
,
the
vampyre
.
 
<EOS>
the
inn
be
scarcely
open
,
when
a
stranger
arrive
,
mount
on
a
coal
-
black
horse
,
and
,
alighting
,
he
surrender
the
bridle
into
the
hand
of
a
boy
who
happen
to
be
at
the
inn
-
door
,
and
stalk
slowly
and
solemnly
into
the
building
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
tall
,
and
of
a
cadaverous
aspect
;
in
attire
he
be
plainly
apparelled
,
but
there
be
no
appearance
of
poverty
about
him
;
on
the
contrary
,
what
he
really
have
on
be
of
a
rich
and
costly
character
,
although
destitute
of
ornament
.
 
<EOS>
He
sit
down
in
the
first
room
that
present
itself
,
and
await
the
appearance
of
the
landlord
,
who
,
upon
be
inform
that
a
guest
of
apparently
ample
mean
,
and
of
some
consequence
,
have
enter
the
place
,
hastily
go
to
him
to
receive
his
command
.
 
<EOS>
with
a
profusion
of
bow
,
our
old
friend
,
who
have
be
so
obsequious
to
Admiral
Bell
,
enter
the
room
,
and
beg
to
know
what
order
the
gentleman
have
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
presume
,
"
say
the
stranger
,
in
a
deep
,
solemn
voice
,
"
<EOS>
I
presume
that
you
have
no
objection
,
for
a
few
day
that
I
shall
remain
in
this
town
,
to
board
and
lodge
me
for
a
certain
price
which
you
can
name
to
me
at
once
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
sir
,
"
say
the
landlord
;
"
any
way
you
please
;
without
wine
,
sir
,
I
presume
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
as
you
please
;
make
your
own
arrangement
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
as
we
can
not
tell
,
of
course
,
what
wine
a
gentleman
may
drink
,
but
when
we
come
to
consider
breakfast
,
dinner
,
tea
,
and
supper
,
and
a
bed
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
,
and
a
private
sitting
-
room
,
I
suppose
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
not
,
then
,
think
,
sir
,
a
matter
of
four
guinea
a
week
will
be
too
much
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
to
name
your
own
charge
.
<EOS>
let
it
be
four
guinea
;
if
you
have
say
eight
I
should
have
pay
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
good
God
!
"
say
the
publican
,
"
here
be
a
damned
fool
that
I
be
.
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
I
do
not
mean
you
.
<EOS>
now
I
could
punch
my
own
head
--
<EOS>
will
you
have
breakfast
at
once
,
sir
,
and
then
we
shall
begin
regular
,

"
 
<EOS>
"
have
what
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Breakfast
,
breakfast

you
know
,
sir
;
tea
,
coffee
,
cocoa
,
or
chocolate
;
ham
,
egg
,
or
a
bit
of
grill
fowl
,
cold
sirloin
of
roast
beef
,
or
a
red
herring
--
anything
you
like
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
take
breakfast
,
so
you
may
spare
yourself
the
trouble
of
provide
anything
for
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
take
breakfast

sir
!
<EOS>
not
take
breakfast
!
<EOS>
Would
you
like
to
take
anything
to
drink
then
,
sir
?
<EOS>
People
say
it
be
an
odd
time
,
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
to
drink
;
but
,
for
my
part
,
I
always
have
think
that
you
could
not
begin
a
good
thing
too
soon
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
live
upon
drink
,
"
say
the
stranger
;
"
but
you
have
none
in
the
cellar
that
will
suit
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
I
be
certain
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
we
have
get
some
claret
now
,
sir
,
"
say
the
landlord
.
 
<EOS>
"
which
may
look
like
blood
,
and
yet
not
be
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
like
what
,
sir?--damn
my
rag
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Begone
,
begone
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
stranger
utter
these
word
so
peremptorily
that
the
landlord
hastily
leave
the
room
,
and
go
into
his
own
bar
,
he
give
himself
so
small
a
tap
on
the
side
of
the
head
,
that
it
would
not
have
hurt
a
fly
,
as
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
punch
myself
into
bit
,
I
could
tear
my
hair
out
by
the
root
;
"
and
then
he
pull
a
little
bit
of
his
hair
,
so
gently
and
tenderly
that
it
show
what
a
man
of
discretion
<EOS>
he
be
,
even
in
the
bad
of
all
his
agony
of
passion
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
idea
,
"
he
add
,
"
of
a
fellow
come
here
,
pay
four
guinea
a
week
for
board
and
lodging
,
tell
me
he
would
not
have
mind
eight
,
and
then
not
want
any
breakfast
;
it
be
enough
to
aggravate
half
a
dozen
saint
;
but
what
an
odd
fish
he
look
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
this
moment
the
ostler
come
in
,
and
,
stand
at
the
bar
,
he
wipe
his
mouth
with
his
sleeve
,
as
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
will
stand
a
quart
for
that
,
master
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
quart
for
what
,
you
vagabond
?
<EOS>
a
quart
because
I
have
do
myself
up
in
heap
;
<EOS>
a
quart
because
I
be
fit
to
pull
myself
into
fiddlestring
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
the
ostler
;
"
because
I
have
just
put
up
the
gentleman
's
horse
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
gentleman
's
horse
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
the
big
-
look
fellow
with
the
white
face
,
now
in
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
,
do
he
come
on
a
horse
,
Sam
?
<EOS>
what
sort
of
a
looking
creature
be
it
?
<EOS>
you
may
judge
of
a
man
from
the
sort
of
horse
-
company
he
keep
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
sir
,
I
hardly
know
.
<EOS>
It
be
coal
black
,
and
look
as
know
as
possible
;
it
be
try
twice
to
get
a
kick
at
me
,
but
I
be
down
upon
him
,
and
put
the
bucket
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
howsomdever
,
I
do
not
think
it
be
a
bad
animal
,
as
a
animal
,
mind
you
,
sir
,
though
a
little
bit
wicious
or
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
the
publican
,
as
he
draw
the
ostler
half
a
pint
instead
of
a
quart
,
"
you
be
always
drink
;
take
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
blow
me
,
"
say
the
ostler
,
"
half
a
pint
,
master
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Plague
take
you
,
I
can
not
stand
parley
with
you
,
there
be
the
parlour
bell
;
perhaps
,
after
all
,
he
will
have
some
breakfast
.
"
 
<EOS>
while
the
landlord
be
away
the
ostler
help
himself
to
a
quart
of
the
strong
ale
,
which
,
by
a
singular
faculty
that
he
have
acquire
,
he
pour
down
his
throat
without
any
effort
at
swallow
,
hold
his
head
back
,
and
the
jug
at
a
little
distance
from
his
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
have
accomplish
this
feat
,
he
reverse
the
jug
,
give
it
a
know
tap
with
his
knuckle
as
though
he
would
have
signify
to
all
the
world
that
it
be
empty
,
and
that
he
have
accomplish
what
he
desire
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
the
landlord
have
make
his
way
to
his
strange
guest
,
who
say
to
him
,
when
he
come
into
the
room
,
 
"
be
there
not
one
Sir
Francis
Varney
reside
in
this
town
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
devil
!

"
think
the
landlord
;
"
this
be
another
of
them
,
I
will
bet
a
guinea
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
sir
,
do
you
say
?
<EOS>
why
,
sir
,
there
be
a
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
but
folk
seem
to
think
as
how
he
be
no
well
than
he
should
be
--
a
sort
of
vampyre
,
sir
,
if
you
know
what
that
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
certainly
,
hear
of
such
thing
;
but
can
you
not
tell
me
Varney
's
address
?
<EOS>
I
wish
to
see
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
sir
,
I
can
not
tell
it
to
you
,
for
there
be
really
be
such
a
commotion
and
such
a
riot
about
him
that
he
be
take
himself
off
,
I
think
,
altogether
,
and
we
can
hear
nothing
of
him
.
<EOS>
Lord
bless
you
,
sir
,
they
burn
down
his
house
,
and
hunt
him
about
so
,
that
I
do
not
think
that
he
will
ever
show
his
face
here
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
can
not
you
tell
me
where
he
be
see
last
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
I
can
not
,
sir
;
but
,
if
anybody
know
anything
about
him
,
it
be
Mr.
Henry
Bannerworth
,
or
perhaps
Dr.
Chillingworth
,
for
they
have
have
more
to
do
with
him
than
anybody
else
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
;
and
can
you
tell
me
the
address
of
the
former
individual
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
I
can
not
,
sir
,
for
the
bannerworth
have
leave
the
Hall
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
doctor
,
sir
,
you
will
see
his
house
in
the
high
-
street
,
with
a
large
brass
plate
on
the
door
,
so
that
you
can
not
mistake
it
.

It
be
no

on
the
other
side
of
the
way

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
for
so
much
information
,

say
the
stranger
,
and
rise
,
he
walk
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
before
,
however
,
he
leave
,
he
turn
,
and
added,--"you
can
say
,
if
you
should
by
chance
meet
Mr.
Bannerworth
,
that
a
hungarian
nobleman
wish
to
speak
to
him
concern
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
the
vampyre
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
what
,
sir
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
nobleman
from
Hungary
,

be
the
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
deuce
!

the
landlord
,
as
he
look
after
him
.
"
<EOS>
He
do
not
seem
at
all
hungry
here
,
not
thirsty
neither
.
<EOS>
what
do
he
mean
by
a
nobleman
from
Hungary
?
<EOS>
the
idea
of
a
man
talk
about
hungry
,
and
not
take
any
breakfast
.
<EOS>
He
be
queer
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
hang
if
I
will
stand
it
.
<EOS>
here
I
clearly
lose
four
guinea
a
week
,
and
then
get
make
game
of
besides
.
<EOS>
a
nobleman
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
think
I
see
him
.
<EOS>
why
,
he
be
not
quite
so
big
as
old
Slaney
,
the
butcher
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
do
.
<EOS>
I
will
have
at
him
when
he
come
back
.
"
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
unconscious
object
of
this
soliloquy
pass
down
the
high
-
street
,
until
he
come
to
Dr.
Chillingworth
's
,
at
whose
door
he
knock
.
 
<EOS>
now
Mrs.
Chillingworth
have
be
wait
the
whole
night
for
the
return
of
the
doctor
,
who
have
not
yet
make
his
appearance
,
and
,
consequently
,
that
lady
's
temper
have
become
acidulate
to
an
uncommon
extent
and
when
she
hear
a
knock
at
the
door
,
something
possess
her
that
it
could
be
no
other
than
her
spouse

and
she
prepare
to
give
him
that
warm
reception
which
she
consider
he
have
a
right
,
as
a
married
man
,
to
expect
after
such
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
She
hurriedly
fill
a
tolerably
sized
hand
-
basin
with
not
the
clean
water
in
the
world
,
and
then
,
open
the
door
hurriedly
with
one
hand
,
she
slouce
the
content
into
the
face
of
the
intruder
,
exclaiming,--

"
now
you
have
catch
it

<EOS>
"
D

"
<EOS>
say
the
hungarian
nobleman
,
and
then
Mrs.
Chillingworth
utter

you

you

the

eagerly

<EOS>
"
in
some
churchyard

to
be
sure
,
gobble
up
the
dead
body

"
 
<EOS>
with
this
Mrs.
Chillingworth
shut
the
door
with
a
bang
that
nearly
flatten
the
Hungarian
's
nose
with
his
face
,
and
he
be
fain
to
walk
away
,
quite
convinced
that
there
be
no
information
to
be
have
in
that
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
He
return
to
the
inn
,
and
have
tell
the
landlord
that
he
would
give
a
handsome
reward
to
any
one
who
would
discover
to
him
the
retreat
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
he
shut
himself
up
in
an
apartment
alone
,
and
be
busy
for
a
time
in
write
letter
.
 
<EOS>
although
the
sum
which
the
stranger
offer
be
an
indefinite
one
,
the
landlord
mention
the
matter
across
the
bar
to
several
person
;
but
all
of
them
shake
their
head
,
believe
it
to
be
a
very
perilous
adventure
indeed
to
have
anything
to
do
with
so
troublesome
a
subject
as
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
<EOS>
as
the
day
advance
,
however
,
a
young
lad
present
himself
,
and
ask
to
see
the
gentleman
who
have
be
inquire
for
Varney

<EOS>
the
landlord
severely
question
and
cross
-
question
him
,
with
the
hope
of
discover
if
he
have
any
information
:
but
the
boy
be
quite
obdurate
,
and
would
speak
to
no
one
but
the
person
who
have
offer
the
reward
,
so
that
mine
host
be
compel
to
introduce
him
to
the
hungarian
nobleman

,
as
yet
,
have
neither
eat

drunk
in
the
house

<EOS>
the
boy
wear
upon
his
countenance
the
very
expression
of
juvenile
cunning
,

when
the
stranger
ask
him
if
he
really
be
in
possession
of
any
information
concern
the
retreat

CHAPTER

<EOS>
the
EXCITED
POPULACE.--VARNEY
<EOS>
hunted.--the
PLACE
of
REFUGE
.
  
<EOS>
[
illustration
]
 
there
seem
,
now
a
complete
lull
in
the
proceeding
as
connect
with
Varney
,
the
vampyre
.
<EOS>
We
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
executioner
who
have
be
as
solicitous
as
Varney
to
obtain
undisputed
possession
of
Bannerworth
Hall
,
have
fall
a
victim
to
the
indiscriminate
rage
of
the
mob
.
<EOS>
Varney
himself
be
a
fugitive
,
and
bind
by
the
most
solemn
tie
to
Charles
Holland
,
not
only
to
communicate
to
him
such
particular
of
the
past
,
as
will
bring
satisfaction
to
his
mind
,
but
to
abstain
from
any
act
which
,
for
the
future
,
shall
exercise
a
disastrous
influence
upon
the
happiness
of
Flora
.
 
<EOS>
the
doctor
and
the
admiral
,
with
Henry
,
have
betake
themselves
from
the
Hall
as
we
have
record
,
and
,
in
due
time
,
reach
the
cottage
where
Flora
and
her
mother
have
find
a
temporary
refuge
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bannerworth
be
up
;
but
Flora
be
sleep
,
and
,
although
the
tiding
they
have
to
tell
be
of
a
curious
and
mixed
nature
,
they
would
not
have
her
disturb
to
listen
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
likewise
,
they
be
rather
pleased
than
otherwise
,
since
they
know
not
exactly
what
have
become
of
Charles
Holland
,
to
think
that
they
would
probably
be
spare
the
necessity
of
say
they
could
not
account
for
his
absence
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
have
go
upon
some
expedition
,
probably
dangerous
,
and
so
one
which
he
do
not
wish
to
communicate
the
particular
of
to
his
friend
,
lest
they
should
make
a
strong
attempt
to
dissuade
him
from
it
,
they
be
induce
to
believe
.
 
<EOS>
but
yet
they
have
that
confidence
in
his
courage
and
active
intellectual
resource
,
to
believe
that
he
would
come
through
it
unscathe
,
and
,
probably
,
shortly
show
himself
at
the
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
hope
they
be
not
disappointed
,
for
in
about
two
hour
<EOS>
Charles
make
his
appearance
;
but
,
until
he
begin
to
be
question
concern
his
absence
by
the
admiral
,
he
scarcely
consider
the
kind
of
dilemma
he
have
put
himself
into
by
the
promise
of
secrecy
he
have
give
to
Varney
,
and
be
a
little
puzzled
to
think
how
much
he
may
tell
,
and
how
much
he
be
bind
in
honour
to
conceal
.
 
<EOS>
"
Avast
there
!
"
cry
the
admiral
;
"
what
be
become
of
your
tongue
,
Charles
?
<EOS>
You
have
be
on
some
cruize
,
I
will
be
bind
.
<EOS>
haul
over
the
ship
's
book
,
and
tell
us
what
be
happen
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
upon
an
adventure
,
"
say
Charles
,
"
which
I
hope
will
be
productive
of
beneficial
result
to
us
all
;
<EOS>
but
,
the
fact
be
,
I
have
make
a
promise
,
perhaps
incautiously
,
that
I
will
not
communicate
what
I
know
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
whew
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
admiral
,
"
that
be
awkward
;
but
,
however
,
if
a
man
say
under
sealed
instruction
,
there
be
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
remember
when
I
be
off
Candia
once---
<EOS>
"
 
"
ha
!
"
interpose
Jack
,
"
that
be
the
time
you
tumble
over
the
blessed
binnacle
,
all
in
consequence
of
take
too
much
Madeira

<EOS>
I
remember
it
,
too
<EOS>
--
it
be
an
out
and
out
good
story
,
that
'
ere
.
<EOS>
You
take
a
rope
's
end
,
you
know

lay
into
the
bowsprit
;
and
,
say
you
,
'
get
up
,
you
lubber
,
'
say
you
,
all
the
while
a
thinking
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
as
it
be
long
Jack
Ingram
,
the
carpenter
's
mate
,
lay
asleep
.
<EOS>
what
a
lark
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
this
scoundrel
will
be
the
death
of
me
,
"
say
the
admiral
;
"
there
be
not
one
word
of
truth
in
what
he
say
.
<EOS>
I
never
get
drunk
in
all
my
life

as
everybody
know

Jack

affair
be
get
serious
between
you

I

we
must
part

for
good

It
be
a
good
many
time
that
I
have
tell
you
you
have
forget
the
difference
between
the
quarter
-
deck
and
the
caboose

<EOS>
now
,
I
be
serious
--
<EOS>
you're
off
the
ship

book

there
be
an
end
of
you

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
good

Jack

I
be
willing
I

good

I'll
leave
you

when
old

off

you

"
 
<EOS>
Jack
turn
upon
his
heel
,
and
,
before
the
admiral
could
make
any
reply
he
leave
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
rascal
up
to
now
?
"
say
the
admiral
.
<EOS>
"
I
really
do
not
think
he
would
have
take
me
at
my
word

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
then
,
after
all
,
you
do
not

Charles

<EOS>
"
what
be
that
to
you
,
<EOS>
you
lubber
,
whether
I

it

go

<EOS>
of
course
I
expect
everybody
to
desert

rat

all

now
Jack
Pringle

go

the
vagabond

drunk

long

he
like

do
not

do
what
he

the
mutinous
thief

<EOS>
do
not

Ushant

up

do
not

you
know
I
do
not

I
see
how
it
be

you
have
disgust
Jack
among
you

<EOS>
a
well
seaman
never
tread
the
deck

his
drunkenness

"
It
be
a
lie

<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
he
ever
get

<EOS>
I
believe
you
all
invent
it

and
Jack
's
so
good
-
natured
,
he
tumble
about
just
to
keep
you
in
countenance

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
his
insolence
,
uncle
;
his
gross
insolence
towards
you
--
his
invention
,
his
exaggeration
of
the
truth
?
"
 
"
Avast
,
there
--
avast
,
there
--
none
of
that
,
Master
Charlie
;
Jack
could
not
do
anything
of
the
sort
;
and
I
mean
to
say
this
,
that
if
Jack
be
here
now
,
I
would
stick
up
for
him
,
and
say
he
be
a
good
seaman
.
 
<EOS>
"
tip
us
your
fin

then
,

say
Jack
,
dart
into
the
room
;
"
do
you
think
I
would
leave
you

you

d----d
old

<EOS>
what
would
become

I
wonder

if
I
be

you
in

dry
nurse

why
,
you
bless
old
babby

what
do
you
mean

it

you
villain

ah
!
go
on

call
me

you

not
you
remember
when
the
bullet
be
scuttle
our

I

I

<EOS>
"
You
bed----d
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
thus
be
the
most
serious
misunderstanding
that
these
two
worthy
ever
have
together
make
up
.
<EOS>
the
real
fact
be
,
that
the
admiral
could
as
little
do
without
Jack
,
as
he
could
have
do
without
food
;
and
as
for
Pringle
,
he
no
more
thought
of
leave
the
old
commodore
,
than
of
--
what
shall
we
say
?
<EOS>
forswear
him
.
<EOS>
Jack
himself
could
not
have
take
a
strong
oath
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
old
admiral
have
suffer
so
much
from
the
idea
that
Jack
have
actually
leave
him
,
that
although
he
abuse
him
as
usual
often
enough
,
he
never
again
talk
of
take
him
off
the
ship
's

<EOS>
the
HUNGARIAN
NOBLEMAN

into
danger.--he

FIRED
AT
,
and
shows

considerably
delighted
be
the
Hungarian
,
not
only
at
the
news
he
have
receive
from
the
boy
,
but
as
well
for
the
cheapness
of
it
.
<EOS>
probably
he
do
not
conceive
it
possible
that
the
secret
of
the
retreat
of
such
a
man
as
Varney
could
have
be
attain
so
easily
.
 
<EOS>
He
wait
with
great
impatience
for
the
evening
,
and
stir
not
from
the
inn
for
several
hour
;
neither
do
he
take
any
refreshment
,
notwithstanding
he
have
make
so
liberal
an
arrangement
with
the
landlord
to
be
supply
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
be
a
matter
of
great
excitement
and
speculation
in
the
inn
,
so
much
so
,
indeed
,
that
the
landlord
send
for
some
of
the
old
customer
of
his
house
,
regular
toper
,
who
sit
there
every
evening
,
indulge
in
strong
drink
,
and
pipe
and
tobacco
,
to
ask
their
serious
advice
as
to
what
he
should
do
,
as
if
it
be
necessary
he
should
do
anything
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
somehow
or
another
,
these
wiseacre
who
assemble
at
the
landlord
's
bidding
,
and
sit
down
,
with
something
strong
before
them
,
in
the
bar
parlour
,
never
once
seem
to
think
that
a
man
may
,
if
he
choose
,
come
to
an
inn
,
and
agree
to
pay
four
guinea
a
week
for
board
and
lodging
,
and
yet
take
nothing
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
no
;
they
could
not
understand
it
,
and
therefore
they
would
not
have
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
monstrous
that
anybody
should
attempt
to
do
anything
so
completely
out
of
the
ordinary
course
of
proceeding
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
bear
;
and
as
in
this
country
it
happen
,
free
and
enlighten
as
we
be
,
that
no
man
can
commit
a
great
social
offence
than
do
something
that
his
neighbour
never
think
of
do
themselves
,
the
hungarian
nobleman
be
vote
a
most
dangerous
character
,
and
,
in
fact
,
not
to
be
put
up
with
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
have
think
so
much
of
it
<EOS>
"
say
the
landlord
;
"
but
only
look
at
the
aggravation
of
the
thing
.
<EOS>
after
I
have
ask
him
four
guinea
a
week
,
and
expect
to
be
beat
down
to
two
,
to
be
then
tell
that
he
would
not
have
care
if
it
have
be
eight
.
<EOS>
It
be
enough
to
aggravate
a
saint
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
agree
with
you
there
,
"
say
another
;
"
that
be
just
what
it
be
,
and
I
only
wonder
that
a
man
of
your
sagacity
have
not
quite
understand
it
before
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
understand
what
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
that
he
be
a
vampyre
.
<EOS>
He
have
hear
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
that
be
the
fact
,
and
he
be
come
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
bird
of
a
feather
,
you
know
,
flock
together
,
and
now
we
shall
have
two
vampyre
in
the
town
instead
of
one
.

<EOS>
the
party
look
rather
blank
at
this
suggestion
,
which
,
indeed
,
seem
rather
uncomfortable
probably
.
<EOS>
the
landlord
have
just
open
his
mouth
to
make
some
remark
,
when
he
be
stop
by
the
violent
ringing
of
what
he
now
call
the
vampyre
's
bell
,
since
it
proceed
from
the
room
where
the
hungarian
nobleman
be
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
you
an
almanack
in
the
house

the
question
of
the
mysterious
guest
.
 
<EOS>
"
an
almanack

sir
?
<EOS>
well
,
I
really
do
not
know

<EOS>
let
me
see
,
an
almanack

"
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
perhaps
,
you
can
tell
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
to
know
the
moon
's
age

"
 
<EOS>
"
the
devil
!

"
think
the
landlord
;
"
he
be
a
vampyre
,
and
no
mistake
.
<EOS>
why
,
sir
,
as
to
the
moon
's
age
,
it
be
a
full
moon
last
night
,
very
bright
and
beautiful
,
only
you
could
not
see
it
for
the
cloud
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
full
moon
last
night
,
"
say
the
mysterious
guest
,
thoughtfully
;
"
it
may
shine
,
then
,
brightly
,
to

night
,
and
if
so
,
all
will
be
well

<EOS>
I
thank
you,--leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
mean
to
say
,
sir
,
you
do
not
want
anything
to
eat
now

"
 
<EOS>
"
what
I
want
I
will
order

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
you
have
order
nothing

"
 
<EOS>
"
then
presume
that
I
want
nothing

"
 
<EOS>
the
discomfited
landlord
be
oblige
to
leave
the
room
,
for
there
be
no
such
a
thing
as
make
any
answer
to
this
,
and
so
,
still
further
confirm
in
his
opinion
that
the
stranger
be
a
vampyre
that
come
to
see
Sir
Francis
Varney
from
a
sympathetic
feeling
towards
him
,
he
again
reach
the
bar
-
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
depend
,
"
he
say
,
"
as
sure
as

that
he

<EOS>
Hilloa
!
<EOS>
he
be
go
<EOS>
off,--after
<EOS>
him
--
after
him
;
he
think
we
suspect
him
.
<EOS>
there
he
go
--
down
the
high
-
street
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
landlord
run
out
,
and
so
do
those
who
be
with
him
,
one
of
whom
carry
his
brandy
and
water
in
his
hand
,
which
,
be
too
hot
for
him
to
swallow
all
at
once
,
he
still
could
not
think
of
leave
behind
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
now
gel
rapidly
dark
,
and
the
mysterious
stranger
be
actually
proceed
towards
the
lane
to
keep
his
appointment
with
the
boy
who
have
promise
to
conduct
him
to
the
hiding
-
place
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
proceed
far
,
however
,
before
he
begin
to
suspect
that
he
be
follow
,
as
it
be
evident
on
the
instant
that
he
alter
his
course
;
for
,
instead
of
walk
down
the
lane
,
where
the
boy
be
wait
for
him
,
he
go
right
on
,
and
seem
desirous
of
make
his
way
into
the
open
country
between
the
town
and
Bannerworth
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
His
pursuer
--
for
they
assume
that
character
--
when
they
see
this
become
anxious
to
intercept
him
;
and
think
that
the
great
force
they
have
the
well
,
they
call
out
aloud
as
they
pass
a
smithy
,
where
a
man
be
shoe
a
horse,--
 
"

no

plague
us
so
long

I

,
he
snatch
from
a
hook
on
which
it
hang

an
old
fowling

piece

and
join
the
pursuit
,
which
now
require
to
be
conduct
with
some
celerity
,
for
the
stranger
have
strike
into
the
open
country
,
and
be
get
on
at
good
speed
.
 
<EOS>
the
last
remnant
of
the
twilight
be
fade
away
,
and
although
the
moon
have
actually
rise
,
its
ray
be
obscure
by
a
number
of
light
,
fleecy
cloud
,
which

although
they
do
not
promise
to
be
of
long
continuance

as

certainly
impede
the
light

<EOS>
"
where

the
blacksmith

"
<EOS>
He

all

you

quite

no

He

<EOS>
"
very

exclaim
the
Smith

<EOS>
He
stoop
,
and
just
as
the
brisk
night
air
blow
aside
the
cloud
from
before
the
face

how
silently
and
sweetly
the
moon
's
ray
fall
upon
the
water
,
upon
the
meadow
,
and
upon
the
wood
.
<EOS>
the
scenery
appear
the
work
of
enchantment
,
some
fairy
land
,
wait
the
appearance
of
its
inhabitant
.
<EOS>
no
sound
meet
the
ear
;
the
very
wind
be
hush
;
nothing
be
there
to
distract
the
sense
of
sight
,
save
the
power
of
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
indeed
,
would
aid
the
effect
of
such
a
scene
.
<EOS>
a
cloudless
sky
,
the
star
all
radiant
with
beauty
,
while
the
moon
,
rise
high
and
high
in
the
heavens
,
increase
in
the
strength
and
refulgence
of
her
light
,
and
dim
the
very
star
,
which
seem
to
grow
gradually
invisible
as
the
majesty
of
the
queen
of
night
become
more
and
more
manifest
.
 
<EOS>
the
dark
wood
and
the
open
meadow
contrast
more
and
more
strongly
;
like
light
and
shade
,
the
earth
and
sky
be
not
more
distinct
and
apart
;
and
the
ripling
stream
,
that
rush
along
with
all
the
impetuosity
of
uneven
ground
.
 
<EOS>
the
bank
be
clothe
with
verdure
;
the
tall
sedge
,
here
and
there
,
line
the
side
;
bed
of
bulrush
raise
their
head
high
above
all
else
,
and
throw
out
their
round
clump
of
blossom
like
tuft
,
and
look
strange
in
the
light
of
the
moon
.
 
<EOS>
here
and
there
,
too
,
the
willow
bent
gracefully
over
the
stream
,
and
their
long
leave
be
waft
and
bear
up
and
down
by
the
gentle
force
of
the
stream
.
 
<EOS>
below
,
the
stream
widen
,
and
run
foam
over
a
hard
,
stony
bottom
,
and
near
the
middle
be
a
heap
of
stone
--
of
large
stone
,
that
form
the
bed
of
the
river
,
from
which
the
water
have
wash
away
all
earthy
particle
,
and
leave
them
by
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
these
stone
in
winter
could
not
be
see
,
they
be
all
under
water
,
and
the
stream
wash
over
in
a
turbulent
and
tumultuous
manner
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
when
the
water
be
clear
and
low
,
they
be
many
of
them
positively
out
of
the
water
,
the
stream
run
around
and
through
their
interstice
;
the
water

weed
here
and
there
lie
at
the
top
of

and
blossom
beautifully
.
 
<EOS>
the
daisy

like
blossom
dance
and
wave
gently
on
the
move
flood
,
at
the
same
time
they
shine
in
the
moonlight
,
like
fairy
face
rise
from
the
depth
of
the
river
,
to
receive
the
principle
of
life
from
the
moon
's
ray
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
sweet
to
wander
in
the
moonlight
at
such
an
hour
,
and
it
be
sweet
to
look
upon
such
a
scene
with
an
unruffled
mind
,
and
to
give
way
to
the
feeling
that
be
engender
by
a
walk
by
the
river
side
.
 
<EOS>
See
,
the
moon
be
rise
high
and
high
,
the
shadow
grow
short
and
short
;
the
river
,
which
in
place
be
altogether
hide
by
the
tall
willow
tree
,
now
gradually
become
less
and
less
hidden
,
and
the
water
become
more
and
more
lit
up
.
 
<EOS>
the
moonbeam
play
gracefully
on
the
rippling
surface
,
here
and
there
appear
like
liquid
silver
,
that
each
instant
change
its
position
and
surface
expose
to
the
light
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
moment
--
such
a
scene
,
be
by
far
too
well
calculated
to
cause
the
most
solemn
and
serious
emotion
of
the
mind

he
must
have
be
but
at
best
insensible

who
could
wander
over
meadow
and
through
grove
,
and
yet
remain
untouched
by
the
scene
of
poetry
and
romance
in
which
he
breathe
and
move
.
 
<EOS>
at
such
a
time

and
in
such
a
place
,
the
world
be
alive
with
all
the
fine
essence
of
mysterious
life
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
at
such
an
hour
that
the
spirit
quit
their
secret
abode
,
and
visit
the
earth
,
and
whirl
round
the
enchant
tree
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
now
the
spirit
of
earth
and
air
dance
their
giddy
flight
from
flower
to
flower

'
<EOS>
Tis
now
they
collect
and
exchange
their
greeting
;
the
wood
be
fill
with
them
,
the
meadow
teem
with
them
,
the
hedge
at
the
river
side
have
them
hide
among
the
deep
green
leave
and
blade
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
be
that
yonder
,
on
the
stone
,
partially
out
of
the
water
--
what
can
it
be
?
<EOS>
the
more
it
be
look
at
,
the
more
it
resemble
the
human
form
--
and
yet
it
be
still
and
motionless
on
the
hard
stone
--
<EOS>
and
yet
it
be
a
human
form
.
<EOS>
the
leg
be
lie
in
the
water
,
the
arm
appear
to
be
partially
in
and
partially
out
,
they
seem
move
by
the
stream
now
and
then
,
but
very
gently
--
so
slightly
,
indeed
,
that
it
may
well
be
question
if
it
move
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
the
moon
's
ray
have
not
yet
reach
it
;
the
bank
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
stream
be
high
,
and
some
tall
tree
rise
up
and
obscure
the
moon
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
rise
high
and
higher
each
moment
,
and
,
finally
,
when
it
have
reach
the
top
of
those
tree
,
then
the
ray
will
reach
the
middle
of
the
river
,
and
then
,
by
degree
,
it
will
reach
the
stone
in
the
river
,
and
,
finally
,
the
body
that
lie
there
so
still
and
so
mysteriously
.
 
<EOS>
how
it
come
there
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
.
<EOS>
It
appear
as
though
,
when
the
water
be
high
,
the
body
have
float
down
,
and
,
at
the
subsidence
of
the
water
,
it
have
be
leave
upon
the
stone
,
and
now
it
be
expose
to
view
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
strange
and
mysterious
,
and
those
who
may
look
upon
such
a
sight
would
feel
their
blood
chill
,
and
their
body
creep
,
to
contemplate
the
remain
of
humanity
in
such
a
place
,
and
in
such
a
condition
as
that
must
be
in
.
 
<EOS>
a
human
life
have
be
take
!
<EOS>
how
?
<EOS>
who
could
tell
?
<EOS>
perhaps
accident
alone
be
the
cause
of
it
;
perhaps
some
one
have
take
a
life
by
violent
mean
,
and
throw
the
body
in
the
water
to
conceal
the
fact
and
the
crime
.
 
<EOS>
the
water
have
bring
it
down
,
and
deposit
it
there
in
the
middle
of
the
river
,
without
any
human
creature
be
acquaint
with
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
moon
rise
--
the
beam
come
tremble
through
the
tree
top
and
straggle
branch
,
and
fall
upon
the
opposite
bank
,
and
there
lie
the
body
,
mid
stream
,
and
in
comparative
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
by
the
time
the
river
be
light
up
by
the
moon
's
ray
,
then
the
object
on
the
stone
will
be
visible
,
then
it
can
be
ascertain
what
appear
now
only
probable
,
<EOS>
namely
,
be
the
dark
object
a
human
form
or
not
?
 
<EOS>
in
the
absence
of
light
it
appear
to
be
so
,
but
when
the
flood
of
silver
light
fall
upon
it
,
it
would
be
place
then
beyond
a
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
the
time
be
approach
--
<EOS>
the
moon
each
moment
approach
her
meridian
,
and
each
moment
do
the
ray
increase
in
number
and
in
strength
,
while
the
shadow
shorten
.
 
<EOS>
the
opposite
bank
each
moment
become
more
and
more
distinct
,
and
the
side
of
the
stream
,
the
green
rush
and
sedge
,
all
by
degree
come
full
into
view
.
 
<EOS>
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
fish
leap
out
of
the
stream
,
and
just
exhibit
itself
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
there
be
thing
live
in
the
stream
,
and
I
be
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
moment
be
one
of
awe
--
the
presence
of
that
mysterious
and
dreadful
-
looking
object
,
even
while
its
identity
remain
doubt
,
chill
the
heart
--
it
contract
the
expand
thought
to
that
one
object
--
<EOS>
all
interest
in
the
scene
lie
center
in
that
one
point
.
 
<EOS>
what
could
it
be
?
<EOS>
what
else
but
a
human
body
?
<EOS>
what
else
could
assume
such
a
form
?
<EOS>
but
see
,
nearly
half
the
stream
be
light
by
the
moonbeam
struggle
through
the
tree
top
,
and
now
rise
above
them
.
<EOS>
the
light
increase
,
and
the
shadow
shorten
.
 
<EOS>
the
edge
of
the
bed
of
stone
now
become
light
up
by
the
moonlight
;
the
ripple
stream
,
the
bubble
,
and
the
tiny
spray
that
be
cause
by
the
rush
of
water
against
the
stone
,
seem
like
sparkling
flash
of
silver
fire
.
 
<EOS>
then
come
the
moonbeam
upon
the
body
,
for
it
be
raise
above
the
level
of
the
water
,
and
shew
conspicuously
;
for
the
moonbeam
reach
the
body
before
they
fall
on
the
surround
water
;
for
that
reason
then
it
be
the
body
present
a
strange
and
ghastly
object
against
a
deep
,
dark
background
,
by
which
it
be
surround
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
do
not
last
long
--
the
water
in
another
minute
be
light
up
by
the
moon
's
pale
beam
,
and
then
indeed
could
be
<EOS>
plainly
enough
see
the
body
of
a
man
lie
on
the
heap
of
stone
motionless
and
ghastly
.
 
<EOS>
the
colourless
hue
of
the
moonlight
give
the
object
a
most
horrific
and
terrible
appearance
!
<EOS>
the
face
of
the
dead
man
be
turn
towards
the
moon
's
ray
,
and
the
body
seem
to
receive
all
the
light
that
could
fall
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
terrible
object
to
look
upon
,
and
one
that
add
a
new
and
singular
interest
to
the
scene
!
<EOS>
the
world
seem
then
to
be
compose
almost
exclusively
of
still
life
,
and
the
body
be
no
impediment
to
the
stillness
of
the
scene
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
,
all
else
consider
,
a
calm
,
beautiful
scene
,
lovely
the
night
,
gorgeous
the
silvery
ray
that
light
up
the
face
of
nature
;
the
hill
and
dale
,
meadow
,
and
wood
,
and
river
,
all
afford
contrast
strong
,
striking
,
and
strange
.
 
<EOS>
but
strange
,
and
more
strange
than
any
contrast
in
nature
<EOS>
,
be
that
afford
to
the
calm
beauty
of
the
night
and
place
by
the
deep
stillness
and
quietude
impose
upon
the
mind
by
that
motionless
human
body
.
 
<EOS>
the
moon
's
ray
now
fall
upon
its
full
length
;
the
foot
be
lie
in
the
water
,
the
head
lie
back
,
with
its
feature
turn
towards
the
quarter
of
the
heavens
where
the
moon
shine
from
;
<EOS>
the
hair
float
on
the
shallow
water
,
while
the
face
and
body
be
expose
to
all
influence
,
from
its
raised
and
prominent
position
.
 
<EOS>
the
moonbeam
have
scarcely
settle
upon
it
--
scarce
a
few
minute
--
when
the
body
move
.
<EOS>
be
it
the
water
that
move
it
?
<EOS>
it
could
not
be
,
surely
,
that
the
moonbeam
have
the
power
of
recall
life
into
that
inanimate
mass
,
that
lie
there
for
some
time
still
and
motionless
as
the
very
stone
on
which
it
lie
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
endue
with
life
;
the
dead
man
gradually
rise
up
,
and
lean
himself
upon
his
elbow
;
he
pause
a
moment
like
one
newly
recall
to
life
;
he
seem
to
become
assured
he
do
live
.
<EOS>
He
pass
one
hand
through
his
hair
,
which
be
wet
,
and
then
rise
higher
into
a
sit
posture
,
and
then
he
lean
on
one
hand
,
incline
himself
towards
the
moon
.
 
<EOS>
His
breast
heave
with
life
,
and
a
kind
of
deep
inspiration
,
or
groan
,
come
from
him
,
as
he
first
awake
to
life
,
and
then
he
seem
to
pause
for
a
few
moment
.
<EOS>
He
turn
gradually
over
,
till
his
head
incline
down
the
stream
.
 
<EOS>
just
below
,
the
water
deepen
,
and
run
swiftly
and
silently
on
amid
mead
and
grove
of
tree
.
<EOS>
the
vampyre
be
revive
;
he
awake
again
to
a
ghastly
life
;
he
turn
from
the
heap
of
stone
,
he
gradually
allow
himself
to
sink
into
deep
water
,
and
then
,
with
a
loud
plunge
,
he
swam
to
the
centre
of
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
slowly
and
surely
do
he
swim
into
the
centre
of
the
river
,
and
down
the
stream
he
go
.
<EOS>
He
take
long
,
but
easy
stroke
,
for
he
be
go
down
the
stream
,
and
that
aid
him
.
 
<EOS>
for
some
distance
may
he
be
hear
and
see
through
the
opening
in
the
tree
,
but
he
become
gradually
more
and
more
indistinct
,
till
sound
and
sight
both
cease
,
and
the
vampyre
have
disappear
.
 
<EOS>
during
the
continuance
of
this
singular
scene
,
not
one
word
have
pass
between
the
landlord
and
his
companion
.
<EOS>
when
the
blacksmith
fire
the
fowling
-
piece
,
and
see
the
stranger
fall
,
apparently
lifeless
,
upon
the
stepping
-
stone
that
cross
the
river
,
he
become
terrified
at
what
he
have
do
,
and
gaze
upon
the
seeming
lifeless
form
with
a
face
on
which
the
utmost
horror
be
depict
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
seem
transfixed
to
the
spot
,
and
although
each
would
have
give
world
to
move
away
,
a
kind
of
nightmare
seem
to
possess
them
,
which
stun
all
their
faculty
,
and
bring
over
them
a
torpidity
from
which
they
find
it
impossible
to
arouse
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
when
the
apparently
dead
man
move
again
,
and
when
,
finally
,
the
body
,
which
appear
so
destitute
of
life
,
roll
into
the
stream
,
and
float
away
with
the
tide
,
their
fright
may
be
consider
to
have
reach
its
climax
.
<EOS>
the
absence
of
the
body
,
however
,
have
seemingly
,
at
all
event
,
the
effect
of
release
them
from
the
mental
and
physical
thraldom
in
which
they
be
,
and
they
be
enable
to
move
from
the
spot
,
which
they
do
immediately
,
make
their
way
towards
the
town
with
great
speed
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
get
near
,
they
hold
a
sort
of
council
of
war
as
to
what
they
should
do
under
the
circumstance
,
the
result
of
which
be
,
that
they
come
to
a
conclusion
to
keep
all
that
they
have
do
and
see
to
themselves
;
<EOS>
for
,
if
they
do
not
,
they
may
be
call
upon
for
some
very
troublesome
explanation
concern
the
fate
of
the
suppose
hungarian
nobleman
whom
they
have
take
upon
themselves
to
believe
be
a
vampyre
,
and
to
shoot
accordingly
,
without
take
the
trouble
to
inquire
into
the
legality
of
such
an
act
.
 
<EOS>
how
such
a
secret
be
likely
to
be
keep
,
when
it
be
share
amongst
seven
people
,
it
be
hard
to
say
;
but
,
if
it
be
so
keep
,
it
could
only
be
under
the
pressure
of
a
strong
feeling
of
self
-
preservation
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
force
individually
,
of
course
,
to
account
for
their
absence
during
the
night
at
their
respective
home
,
and
how
they
manage
to
do
that
be
best
known
to
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
landlord
,
he
feel
compel
to
state
that
,
have
his
suspicion
of
his
guest
arouse
,
he
follow
him
on
a
walk
that
he
pretend
to
take
,
and
he
have
go
so
far
,
that
at
length
he
have
give
up
the
chase
,
and
lose
his
own
way
in
return
.
 
<EOS>
thus
be
it
,
then
,
that
this
affair
still
preserve
all
its
mystery
,
with
a
large
superadde
amount
of
fear
attendant
upon
it
;
for
,
if
the
mysterious
guest
be
really
anything
supernatural
,
may
he
not
come
again
in
a
much
more
fearful
shape
,
and
avenge
the
treatment
he
have
receive
?
 
<EOS>
the
only
person
who
fall
any
disappointment
in
the
affair
,
or
whose
expectation
be
not
realise
,
be
the
boy
who
have
make
the
appointment
with
the
suppose
vampyre
at
the
end
of
the
lane
,
and
who
be
to
have
receive
what
he
consider
<EOS>
so
large
a
reward
for
point
out
the
retreat
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
 
<EOS>
He
wait
in
vain
for
the
arrival
of
the
hungarian
nobleman
,
and
,
at
last
,
indignation
get
the
well
of
him
,
and
he
walk
away
.
<EOS>
feel
that
he
have
be
jilt
,
he
resolve
to
proceed
to
the
public
-
house
and
demand
the
half
-
crown
which
have
be
so
liberally
promise
him
;
but
when
he
reach
there
he
find
that
the
party
whom
he
seek
be
not
within
,
nor
the
landlord
either
<EOS>
,
for
that
be
the
precise
time
when
that
worthy
individual
be
pursue
his
guest
over
meadow
and
bill
,
through
brake
and
through
briar
,
towards
the
step
stone
on
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
what
the
boy
further
do
on
the
follow
day
,
when
he
find
that
he
be
to
reap
no
more
benefit
for
the
adventure
,
we
shall
soon
perceive
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
the
landlord
,
he
do
endeavour
to
catch
a
few
hour
'
brief
repose
;
but
as
he
dream
that
the
hungarian
nobleman
come
in
the
likeness
of
a
great
toad
,
and
sit
upon
his
chest
,
feel
like
the
weight
of
a
mountain
,
while
he
,
the
landlord
,
try
to
scream
and
cry
for
help
,
but
find
that
he
could
neither
do
one
thing
nor
the
other
,
we
may
guess
that
his
repose
do
not
at
all
invigorate
him
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
himself
express
it
,
he
get
up
all
of
a
shake
,
with
a
strong
impression
that
he
be
a
very
ill
-
use
individual
,
indeed
,
to
have
have
the
nightmare
in
the
day
time
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
we
will
return
to
the
cottage
where
the
Bannerworth
family
be
at
all
event
,
make
themselves
quite
as
happy
as
they
do
at
their
ancient
mansion
,
in
order
to
see
what
be
there
pass
,
and
how
Dr.
Chillingworth
make
an
effort
to
get
up
some
evidence
of
something
that
the
Bannerworth
family
know
nothing
of
<EOS>
,
therefore
could
not
very
well
be
expect
to
render
him
much
assistance
.
<EOS>
that
he
do
,
however
,
make
what
he
consider
an
important
discovery
,
we
shall
perceive
in
the
course
of
the
ensue
chapter
,
in
which
it
will
be
see
that
the
best
hide
thing
will
,
by
the
mere
accident
,
sometimes
come
to
light
,
and
that
,
too
,
when
least
expect
by
any
one
at
all
connect
with
the
result

<EOS>
the
little
episode
have
just
take
place
which
we
have
record
between
the
old
admiral
and
Jack
Pringle
,
when
Henry
Bannerworth
and
Charles
Holland
step
aside
to
converse
.
 
<EOS>
"
Charles
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
it
have
become
absolutely
necessary
that
I
should
put
an
end
to
this
state
of
dependence
in
which
we
all
live
upon
your
uncle
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
bad
to
think
,
that
because
,
through
fight
the
battle
of
his
country
,
he
have
amass
some
money
,
we
be
to
eat
it
up
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
friend
,
"
say
Charles
,
"
do
it
not
strike
you
,
that
it
would
be
a
great
deal
bad
than
too
bad
,
if
my
uncle
could
not
do
what
he
like
with
his
own
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
but
,
Charles
,
that
be
not
the
question
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
,
though
I
know
not
<EOS>
what
other
question
you
can
make
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
all
talk
it
over
,
<EOS>
my
mother
,
my
brother
,
and
Flora
;
and
my
brother
and
I
have
determine
,
if
this
state
of
thing
should
last
much
longer
,
to
find
out
some
mean
of
honourable
exertion
by
which
we
may
,
at
all
event
,
maintain
ourselves
without
be
burdensome
to
any
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
we
will
talk
of
that
another
time
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
but
hear
me
;
we
be
think
that
if
we
go
into
some
branch
of
the
public
service
,
your

<EOS>

well
,
well
,
Henry
,
that
be
all
very
well
;
but
for
a
little
time
do
not
throw
up
the
old
man
and
make
him
unhappy
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
be
his
only
relative
in
the
world
,
and
<EOS>
,
as
he
have
often
say
,
he
intend
leave
me
heir
to
all
he
possess

you
see
there
be
no
harm
do
by
you
receive
a
small
portion
of
it
beforehand

"
 
<EOS>
"
and
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
by
that
line
of
argument
,
we
be
to
find
an
excuse
for
rob
your

in

that
we
be
rob
you
likewise

no

you

rightly

well
,
all
I
can
say
be
,
Charles
,
that
while
I
feel
,
and
while
we
all
feel
,
the
deep
debt
of
gratitude
towards
your
uncle
,
it
be
our
duty
to
do
something
.
<EOS>
in
a
box
which
we
have
bring
with
us
from
the
Hall
,
and
which
have
not
be
open
since
our
father
's
death
,
I
have
stumble
over
some
article
of
ancient
jewellery
and
plate
,
which
,
at
all
event
,
will
produce
something
.

which
you
must
not
part
with
.

Nay
,

,
Charles
,
these
be
thing
I
know
not
we
possess
,
and
most
ill
-
suit
do
they
happen
to
be
to
our
fall
fortune
.
<EOS>
It
be
money
we
want
,
not
the
gewgaw
of
a
former
state
,
to
which
we
can
have
now
no
sort
of
pretension
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
nay
,
I
know
you
have
all
the
argument
;
but
still
be
there
something
sad
and
uncomfortable
to
one
's
feeling
in
part
with
such
thing
as
those
which
have
be
in
family
for
many
year
.
<EOS>

we
know
not
that
we
have
them
;
remember
that

come
and
look
at
them
.
<EOS>
those
relic
of
a
bygone
age
may
amuse
you
,
and
,
as
regard
myself
,
there
be
no
circumstance
whatever
associate
with
them
that
give
them
any
extrinsic
value
;
so
laugh
at
them

admire
them
,
as
you
please

I
shall
most
likely
be
able
to
join
with
you
in
either
feeling

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
be
it
so
--
I
will
come
and
look
at
them
;

you
must
think
better
of
what
you
say
concern
my
uncle
,
for
I
happen
to
know
--
<EOS>
which
you
ought
likewise
by
this
time
--
how
seriously
the
old
man
would
feel
any
rejection
on
your
part
of
the
good
he
fancy
he
be
do
you
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
Henry
,
it
be
completely
his
hobby
,
and
let
him
have
earn
his
money
with
ten
time
the
danger
he
have
,
he
could
not
spend
it
with
anything
like
the
satisfaction
that
he
do
,

he
be
allow
to
dispose
of
it
in
this
way

well

well
;
be
it
so
for
a
time

the
fact
be
,
his
attachment
to
Flora
be
so
great
--
which
be
a
most
fortunate

me

that
I
should
not
be

all
surprise
that

cut
me
out

one
half
my
estate
,
when
the
old
man
die

<EOS>
but
come
,
we
will
look
at
your
ancient
bijouterie
.
"
 
<EOS>
Henry
lead
Charles
into
an
apartment
of
the
cottage
where
some
of
the
few
thing
have
be
place
that
be
bring
from
Bannerworth
Hall
,
which
be
not
likely
to
be
in
constant
and
daily
use
.
 
<EOS>
among
these
thing
happen
to
be
the
box
which
Henry
have
mention
,
and
from
which
he
have
take
a
miscellaneous
assortment
of
thing
of
an
antique
and
singular
character
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
old
dress
of
a
season
and
of
a
taste
long
go
by
;
ancient
article
of
defence
;
some
curiously
work
dagger
;
and
a
few
ornament
,
pretty
,
but
valueless
,
along
with
other
of
more
sterling
pretension
,
which
Henry
point
out
to
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
almost
inclined
to
think
,
"
say
the
latter
,
"
that
some
of
these
thing
be
really
of
considerable
value
;
but
I
do
not
I
profess
to
be
an
accurate
judge
,
and
,
perhaps
,
I
be
more
take
with
the
beauty
of
an
article
,
than
the
intrinsic
worth
.
<EOS>
what
be
that
which
you
have
just
take
from
the
box
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
seem
a
half

course

the
shock
be
a
great
one
to
us
all

I
must
confess
that
we
none
of
us
know
much
of
a

's
affection

<EOS>
but
time
reconcile
one
to
these
dispensation

to
a
friend

like
yourself
,
I
can
talk
upon
these
subject
without
a
pang

"
 
<EOS>
He
lay
down
the
mask
,
and
proceed
further
in
his
search
in
the
old
box
.
 
<EOS>
towards
the
bottom
of
it
there
be
some
book
,
and
,
crush
in
by
the
side
of
them

,
there
be
an
ancient

out

you
may
find
a
fortune
when

those
who
expect
nothing

Henry

will
not

fall
from
it

<EOS>
Charles
take
up
the
card
,
and
read
upon
it
the
name
of
Count
Barrare
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
name
,
"
he
say
,
"
seem
familiar
to
me

<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
now
I
recollect
,
I
have
read
of
such
a
man
.
<EOS>
He
flourish
some
twenty
,
or
five
-
and
-
twenty
year
ago
,
and
be
consider
a
_
roue
_
of
the
first
water
--
a
finished
gamester
;
and
,
in
a
sort
of
brief
memoir
I
read
once
of
him
,
it
say
that
he
disappear
suddenly
one
day
,
and
be
never
again
hear
of
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
be
not
puzzle
to
think
how
his
card
come
into
my
father
's
pocket
-
book
.
<EOS>
They
meet
at
some
gaming
-
house
;
and
,
if
some
old
pocket
-
book
of
the
Count
Barrare
's
be
shake
,
there
may
fall
from
it
a
card
,
with
the
name
of
Mr.
Marmaduke
Bannerworth
upon
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
there
nothing
further
in
the
pocket
-
book
--
no
memoranda

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
look
.
<EOS>
stay
!
<EOS>
here
be
something
upon
one
of
the
leave
--
let
me
see--'Mem

,
twenty
-
five
thousand
pound
!
<EOS>
He
who
rob
the
robber
,
steal
little
;
it
be
not
mean
to
kill
him
:
but
it
will
be
unsafe
to
use
the
money
for
a
time
--
my
brain
seem
on
fire
--
the
remote
hiding
-
place
in
the
house
be
behind
the
picture
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think
of
that
?
"
say
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
what
to
think
.
<EOS>
there
be
one
thing
though
,
that
I
do
know
.

<EOS>
"
and
what
be
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
father
's
handwriting

<EOS>
I
have
many
scrap
of
his
,
and
his
peculiar
hand
be
familiar
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
strange
,
then
,
what
it
can
refer
to
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Charles
--
Charles
!
<EOS>
there
be
a
mystery
connect
with
our
fortune
,
that
I
never
could
unravel
;
and
once
or
twice
it
seem
as
if
we
be
upon
the
point
of
discover
all
;
but
something
have
ever
interfere
to
prevent
us
,
and
we
have
be
throw
back
into
the
realm
of
conjecture
.
<EOS>
My
father
's
last
word
be
,
'
the
money
be
hide
;
'
and
then
he
try
to
add
something
;
but
death
stop
his
utterance
.
<EOS>
now
,
do
it
not
almost
seem
that
this
memorandum
allude
to
the
circumstance
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
do
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
then
,
scarcely
have
my
father
breathe
his
last
,
when
a
man
come
and
ask
for
him
at
the
garden
-
gate
,
and
,
upon
hear
that
he
be
dead
,
utter
some
imprecation
,
and
walk
away
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
Henry
,
you
must
trust
to
time
and
circumstance
to
unravel
these
mystery
.
<EOS>
for
myself
,
I
own
that
I
can
not
do
so
;
I
see
no
earthly
way
out
of
the
difficulty
whatever
.
<EOS>
but
still
it
do
appear
to
me
as
if
Dr.
Chillingworth
know
something
or
have
hear
something
,
with
which
he
really
ought
to
make
you
acquaint
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
blame
the
worthy
doctor
;
he
may
have
make
an
error
of
judgment
,
but
never
one
of
feeling
;
and
you
may
depend
,
if
he
be
keep
anything
from
me
,
that
he
be
do
so
from
some
excellent
motive
:
most
probably
because
he
think
it
will
give
me
pain
,
and
so
will
not
let
me
endure
any
unhappiness
from
it
,
unless
he
be
quite
certain
as
regard
the
fact
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
so
,
you
may
depend
he
will
be
communicative
,
and
I
shall
know
all
that
he
have
to
relate
.
<EOS>
but
,
Charles
,
it
be
evident
to
me
that
you
,
too
,
be
keep
something
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
you
acknowledge
to
have
have
an
interview
,
and
a
friendly
one
,
with
Varney
;
and
you
likewise
acknowledge
that
he
have
tell
you
thing
which
he
have
compel
you
to
keep
secret
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
promise
to
keep
them
secret
,
and
I
deeply
regret
the
promise
that
I
have
make
.
<EOS>
there
can
not
be
anything
to
my
mind
more
essentially
disagreeable
than
to
have
one
's
tongue
tie
in
one
's
interview
with
friend
.
<EOS>
I
hate
to
hear
anything
that
I
may
not
repeat
to
those
whom
I
take
into
my
own
confidence

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
understand
the
feeling
;

here
come
the
worthy
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
show
him
the
memorandum

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
Dr.
Chillingworth
enter
the
apartment
Henry
hand
him
the
memorandum
that
have
be
find
in
the
old
pocket
-
book

say
as
he
do
so,--
 
<EOS>
"
look
at

,
doctor

give
us
your
candid
opinion
upon
it

Dr.
Chillingworth
fit
on
his
spectacle

and
read
the
paper
carefully

<EOS>
at
its
conclusion
,
he
screw
up
his
mouth
into
an
extremely
small
compass
,
and
double
up
the
paper
,
he
put
it
into
his
capacious
waistcoat
pocket

say
as
he
do
so,--

!

oh
!

oh
!

oh
!
hum
!

well

"
we
be
wait
for
your
opinion

"
 
<EOS>
"
My
opinion
!
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
my
dear
boy
,
I
must
say
,
my
opinion
,
to
the
good
of
my
belief
be
,
that
I
really
do
not
know
anything
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
,
perhaps
,
you
will
surrender
us
the
memorandum
,
"
say
Charles
;
"
because
,
if
you
do
not
know
anything
,
we
may
as
well
make
a
little
inquiry
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ha
!
"
say
the
worthy
doctor
;
"
we
can
not
put
old
head
upon
young
shoulder
,
that
be
quite
clear
.
<EOS>
now
,
my
good
young
man
,
be
patient
and
quiet
;
recollect
,
that
what
you
know
you
be
acquaint
with
,
and
that
that
which
be
hide
from
you
,
you
can
not
very
well
come
to
any
very
correct
conclusion
upon
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
right
side
and
a
wrong
one
you
may
depend
,
to
every
question
;

he
who
walk
heedlessly
in
the
dark

be
very
apt
to
run
his
head
against
a
post

<EOS>
good
evening
,
my
boy
--
good
evening
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
away
bustle
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Charles
,
"
what
do
you
think
of
that
,
Mr.
Henry
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
know
what
he
be
about

"
 
<EOS>
"
that
may
be
;
but
I
will
be
hang
if
anybody
else
do
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
be
by
no
mean
favourable
to
the
march
of
popular
information
;
and
I
really
think
he
may
have
give
us
some
food
for
reflection
,
instead
of
leave
us
so
utterly
and
entirely
at
fault
as
he
have
;
and
you
know
he
be
take
away
your
memorandum
even
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
let
him
have
it
,
Charles
--
let
him
have
it
;
it
be
safe
with
him
.
<EOS>
the
old
man
may
be
,
and
I
believe
be
,
a
little
whimsical
and
crotchety
;
but
he
mean
abundantly
well
,
and
he
be
just
one
of
those
sort
of
person
,
and
always
be
,
who
will
do
good
his
own
way
,
or
not
at
all
;
so
we
must
take
the
good
with
the
bad
in
those
case
,
and
let
Dr.
Chillingworth
do
as
he
please
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
it
be
nothing
to
me
,
although
those
word
be
rise
to
my
lip
,
because
you
know
,
Henry
,
that
everything
which
concern
you
or
yours
be
something
to
me
;
and
therefore
it
be
that
I
feel
extremely
anxious

the
solution

<EOS>
before
I

the

Varney

so
strongly

me

procure
his

it

Should

beg
him
to
withhold
his
confidence

Nay

do
not

so

Charles

do

recollect

although
you
can
not

you
can

to

from

so
that
you
can
make

beneficial

not
in
every
way

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

there
be
reason
in

I
give
in
at
once

<EOS>
be
it
so

Henry

<EOS>
I
will
wait
on
him

if
I

not
induce
him
to
change
his
determination
,

allow
me
to
tell
some
other
as
well

Flora

I
must
give
in

take
the
thing
as
a
secret

although
I
shall
not
abandon
a
hope

even
after

tell
me
all
he
have
to
tell

that
I
may
induce
him
to
permit
me
to
make

partial

he

empower
me
to
do

"
 
<EOS>

It
may
be
so

,
at

You

I

keep

disaster

I
say
our

because
I
consider

Heaven
grant

it
may

I
feel
that
Bannerworth

never

I
should
prefer
that
we
seek
for
new
association

I
have
no
doubt
we
may
find

that
among

we
get
up

be
it

I
be
sure

gladly
give
way

such
an
arrangement

He
have
often
intimate
that
he

Bannerworth

consequently
,

pretend

upon

really
tend
to

we

you
may
well
imagine

the

up

now
that

there
be
active
influence
at
work

to
prevent
Sir

so
quickly

he
have
arrange

carry
out
his

make
Charles
Holland
acquaint
with
the
history
of
the
eventful
period
of
his
life
,
which
have
be
associate
with
Marmaduke
Bannerworth

<EOS>
one
would
have
scarcely
think
it
possible
that
anything
now
would
have
prevent
Varney
from
conclude
his
strange
narrative
;
but
that
he
be
prevent
,
will
appear
.
 
<EOS>
the
boy
who
have
be
promise
such
liberal
payment
by
the
hungarian
nobleman
,
for
betray
the
place
of
Varney
's
concealment
,
we
have
already
state
,
feel
bitterly
the
disappointment
of
not
be
meet
,
accord
to
promise
,
at
the
corner
of
the
lane
,
by
that
individual
.
 
<EOS>
It
not
only
deprive
him
of
the
half
-
crown
,
which
already
in
imagination
he
have
lay
out
,
but
it
be
a
great
blow
to
his
own
importance
,
for
after
his
discovery
of
the
residence
of
the
vampyre
,
he
look
upon
himself
as
quite
a
public
character
,
and
expect
great
applause
for
his
cleverness
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
the
hungarian
nobleman
come
not
,
all
these
dream
begin
to
vanish
into
thin
air
,
and
,
like
the
unsubstantial
fabric
of
a
vision
,
to
leave
no
trace
behind
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
get
dreadfully
aggravate
,
and
his
first
thought
be
to
go
to
Varney
,
and
see
what
he
could
get
from
him
,
by
betray
the
fact
that
some
one
be
actively
in
search
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
that
seem
,
however
,
a
doubtful
good
,
and
perhaps
there
be
some
personal
dread
of
the
vampyre
mix
up
with
the
rejection
of
this
proposition
.
<EOS>
but
reject
it
he
do
,
and
then
he
walk
moodily
into
the
town
without
any
fix
resolution
of
what
he
should
do
.
 
<EOS>
all
that
he
think
of
be
a
general
idea
that
he
should
like
to
create
some
mischief
,
if
possible
--
what
it
be
he
care
not
,
so
long
as
it
make
a
disturbance
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
he
know
well
that
the
most
troublesome
and
fidgetty
man
in
the
town
be
Tobias
Philpots
,
a
saddler
,
who
be
always
full
of
everybody
's
business
but
his
own
,
and
ever
ready
to
hear
any
scandal
of
his
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
good
mind
,
"
say
the
boy
,
"
to
go
to
old
philpot
,
and
tell
him
all
about
it
,
that
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
good
mind
soon
strengthen
itself
into
a
fix
resolution
,
and
full
of
disdain
and
indignation
at
the
suppose
want
of
faith
of
the
hungarian
nobleman
,
he
pause
opposite
the
saddler
's
door
.
 
<EOS>
Could
he
but
for
a
moment
have
suspect
the
real
reason
why
the
appointment
have
not
be
keep
with
him
,
all
his
curiosity
would
have
be
doubly
arouse
,
and
he
would
have
follow
the
landlord
of
the
inn
and
his
associate
upon
the
track
of
the
second
vampyre
that
have
visit
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
but
of
this
he
know
nothing
,
for
that
proceeding
have
be
conduct
with
amazing
quietness
;
and
the
fact
of
the
hungarian
nobleman
,
when
he
find
that
he
be
follow
,
take
a
contrary
course
to
that
in
which
Varney
be
conceal
,
prevent
the
boy
from
know
anything
of
his
movement
.
 
<EOS>
hence
the
thing
look
to
him
like
a
piece
of
sheer
neglect
and
contemptuous
indifference
,
which
he
feel
bind
to
resent
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
pause
long
at
the
door
of
the
saddler
's
,
but
,
after
a
few
moment
,
he
walk
boldly
in
,
and
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
Master
Philpots
,
I
have
get
something
extraordinary
to
tell
you

you
may
give
me
what
you
like
for
tell
you

"
 
<EOS>
"
go
on
,
then

be
just

price
I
always
like
to
pay
for
everything

<EOS>
"
Will
you
keep

secret

I
will
.

when
do
you
ever
hear
of
me
tell
anything

a

never
to
a

individual

I
have
hear
you
tell
thing
to
the
whole

"
confound
your

get
out
of
my

shall
know

<EOS>
mind

you
have
promise

to
keep

so
that
if
it
get
know

you
know
it
can
not
be
any
fault
of
mine

"
 
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
the
boy
be
anxious
it
should
be
know
,
only
that
in
case
some
consequence
may
arise
,
he
think
he
would
quiet
his
own
conscience
,
by
get
a
promise
of
secrecy
from
Tobias
Philpots
,
which
he
well
know
that
individual
would
not
think
of
keep

<EOS>
He
then
relate
to
him
the
interview
he
have
have
with
the
hungarian
nobleman
at
the
inn
,
how
he
have
promise
a
number
of
half
-
crown
,
but
a
very
small
instalment
of
which
he
have
receive
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
Master
Philpots
care
very
little
for
,
but
the
information
that
the
dread
Varney
,
the
vampyre
,
be
conceal
so
close
to
the
town
be
a
matter
of
great
and
abound
interest
,
and
at
that
part
of
the
story
he
suddenly
prick
up
his
ear
amazingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
do
not
mean
to
say
that
?
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
be
you
sure
it
be
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes

I
be
quite
certain

have
see
I
him
more
than
once

be
Sir
Francis
Varney

without
any
mistake

why
,
then
you
may
depend
he
be
only
wait
until
it
be
very
dark
,
and
then
he
will
walk
into
somebody
,
and
suck
his
blood
.
<EOS>
here
be
a
horrid
discovery
!
<EOS>
I
think
we
have
have
enough
of
Master
Varney
,
and
that
he
would
hardly
show
himself
here
again
,
and
now
you
tell
me
he
be
not
ten
minute
'
walk
off
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
fact
,
"
say
the
boy
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
him
go
in
,
and
he
look
thin
and
more
horrid
than
ever
.

I
be
sure
he
want
a
dollop
of
blood
from
somebody
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
wonder
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
now
there
be
Mrs.
Philpots
,
you
know
,
sir
;
she
be
rather
big
,
and
seem
most
ready
to
burst
always
;
I
should
not
wonder
if
the
vampyre
come
to
her
to
-
night

"
Would
not
you
?

say
Mrs.
Philpots

who
have
walk
into

shop
,
and
overhear
the
whole
conversation
;
"
would
not
you
,
really
?
<EOS>
I
will
vampyre
you
,
and
teach
you
to
make
these
remark
about
respectable
married
woman
.

You
young
wretch

take
that
,
will
you
!

She
give
the
boy
such
a
box
on
the
ear
,
that
the
place
seem
to
spin
round
with
him
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
recover
sufficiently
to
be
enable
to
walk
,
he
make
his
way
from
the
shop
with
abundance
of
precipitation
,
much
regretting
that
he
have
trouble
himself
to
make
a
confidant
of
Master
Philpots
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
he
could
not
but
tell
himself
that
if
his
object
be
to
make
a
general
disturbance
through
the
whole
place
,
he
have
certainly
succeed
in
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
He
slink
home
perhaps
with
a
feeling
that
he
may
be
call
upon
to
take
part
in
something
that
may
ensue
,
and
at
all
event
be
compel
to
become
a
guide
to
the
place
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
's
retreat
,
in
which
case
,
for
all
he
know
,
the
vampyre
may
,
by
some
more
than
mortal
mean
,
discover
what
a
hand
he
have
have
in
the
matter
,
and
punish
him
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
the
moment
he
hide
leave
the
saddler
's
Mrs.
Philpots
,
after
use
some
bitter
reproach
to
her
husband
for
not
at
once
sacrifice
the
boy
upon
the
spot
for
the
disrespectful
manner
in
which
he
have
speak
of
her
,
hastily
put
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl
,
and
<EOS>
the
saddler
,
although
it
be
a
full
hour
before
the
usual
time
,
begin
put
up
the
shutter
of
his
shop
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
my
dear
,
"
he
say
to
Mrs.
Philpots
,
when
she
come
down
stair
equip
for
the
street
,
"
why

my

where
be
you
go

"
<EOS>
and
pray
,
sir

what
be

shut
up
the
shop
for
at
this
time
of
the
evening

"
oh
!
why

the
fact
be

I
think
I
would
just
go
to
the
Rose

mention

near

close
,
Mr.
Philpots
run
off
to
the
Rose
and
Crown
,
and
Mrs
,
Philpots
,
with
as
much
expedition
as
she
could
,
purpose
make
the
grand
tour
of
all
her
female
acquaintance
in
the
town
,
just
to
tell
them
,
as
a
great
secret
,
that
the
vampyre
,
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
as
he
call
himself
,
have
take
refuge
at
the
house
that
be
to
let
down
the
lane
lead
to
Higgs
's
farm
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
by
no
means
,
"
she
say
,
"
let
it
go
no
further
,
because
it
be
a
very
wrong
thing
to
make
any
disturbance
,
and
you
will
understand
that
it
be
quite
a
secret
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
be
listen
to
with
breathless
attention
,
as
may
well
be
suppose
,
and
it
be
a
singular
circumstance
that
at
every
house
she
leave
some
other
lady
put
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl
,
and
run
out
to
make
the
circle
of
her
acquaintance
,
with
precisely
the
same
story
,
and
precisely
the
same
injunction
to
secrecy
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
as
Mr.
Philpots
pursue
an
extremely
similar
course
,
we
be
not
surprised
that
in
the
short
space
of
one
hour
the
news
should
have
spread
through
all
the
town
,
and
that
there
be
scarcely
a
child
old
enough
to
understand
what
be
be
talk
about
,
who
be
ignorant
of
the
fact
,
that
Sir
Francis
Varney
be
to
be
find
at
the
empty
house
down
the
lane
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
unlucky
time
,
too
,
for
the
night
be
creep
on
,
a
period
at
which
people
's
apprehension
of
the
supernatural
become
each
moment
strong
and
more
vivid
--
a
period
at
which
a
number
of
idler
be
let
loose
for
different
employment
,
and
when
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
row
or
a
riot
present
itself
in
pleasant
colour
to
those
who
have
nothing
to
lose
and
who
expect
,
under
the
cover
of
darkness
,
to
be
able
to
commit
outrage
they
would
be
afraid
to
think
of
in
the
daytime
,
when
recognition
would
be
more
easy
.
 
<EOS>
thus
be
it
that
Sir
Francis
Varney
's
position
,
although
he
know
it
not
,
become
momentarily
one
of
extreme
peril
,
and
the
danger
he
be
about
to
run
,
be
certainly
great
than
any
he
have
as
yet
experience
.
<EOS>
have
Charles
Holland
but
know
what
be
go
on
,
he
would
undoubtedly
have
do
something
to
preserve
the
suppose
vampyre
from
the
mischief
that
threaten
him
,
but
the
time
have
not
arrive
when
he
have
promise
to
pay
him
a
second
visit
,
so
he
have
no
idea
of
anything
serious
have
occur
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
,
too
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Philpots
scarcely
anticipate
create
so
much
confusion
,
but
when
they
find
that
the
whole
place
be
in
an
uproar
,
and
that
a
tumultuous
assemblage
of
person
call
aloud
for
vengeance
upon
Varney
,
the
vampyre
,
they
make
their
way
home
again
in
no
small
fright
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
now
,
what
be
the
result
of
all
these
proceeding
will
be
best
know
by
our
introduce
the
reader
to
the
interior
of

in
which
Varney
have
find
a
temporary
refuge

on
the
tree
top
the
moon
shine
brightly
,
and
the
long
shadow
be
shoot
its
ray
down
upon
the
water
,
and
the
green
field
appear
clothe
in
a
flood
of
silver
light
;
the
little
town
be
quiet
and
tranquil
--
nature
seem
at
rest
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
mansion
in
which
Sir
Francis
Varney
have
take
refuge
,
stand
empty
and
solitary
;
it
seem
as
though
it
be
not
associate
with
the
other
by
which
it
be
surround
.
<EOS>
It
be
gloomy
,
and
in
the
moonlight
it
remind
one
of
thing
long
go
by
,
existence
that
have
once
be
,
but
now
no
longer
of
this
present
time
--
a
mere
memento
of
the
past
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
recline
upon
the
house
-
top
;
he
gaze
upon
the
sky
,
and
upon
the
earth
;
he
see
the
calm
tranquillity
that
reign
around
,
and
could
not
but
admire
what
he
see
<EOS>
;
he
sigh
,
he
seem
to
sigh
,
from
a
pleasure
he
feel
in
the
fact
of
his
security
;
he
could
repose
there
without
fear
,
and
breathe
the
balmy
air
that
fan
his
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
"
he
mutter
,
"
thing
may
have
be
bad
,
but
not
much
bad
;
however
,
they
may
have
be
much
well
;
the
ignorant
be
away
--
the
most
to
be
fear
,
because
they
have
no
guide
and
no
control
,
save
what
can
be
exert
over
them
by
their
fear
and
their
passion
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
pause
to
look
again
over
the
scene
,
and
,
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
,
and
that
,
moonlight
as
it
be
,
be
many
mile
,
the
country
be
diversify
with
hill
and
dale
,
meadow
and
ploughed
land
;
the
open
field
,
and
the
dark
wood
,
and
the
silvery
stream
that
run
at
no
great
distance
,
all
present
a
scene
that
be
well
calculate
to
warm
the
imagination
,
and
to
give
the
mind
that
charm
which
a
cultivate
understanding
be
capable
of
receive
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
but
one
thing
want
to
make
such
a
scene
one
of
pure
happiness
,
and
that
be
all
absence
of
care
of
fear
for
the
future
and
the
want
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
there
be
a
slight
sound
that
come
from
the
town
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
slight
,
but
the
ear
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
be
painfully
acute
of
late
;
the
least
sound
that
come
across
him
be
hear
in
a
moment
,
and
his
whole
visage
be
change
to
one
of
listen
interest
.
 
<EOS>
the
sound
be
hush
;
but
his
attention
be
not
lull
,
for
he
have
be
place
in
circumstance
that
make
all
his
vigilance
necessary
for
his
own
preservation
.
<EOS>
hence
it
be
,
what
another
would
have
pass
over
,
or
not
hear
at
all
,
he
both
hear
and
notice
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
sure
of
the
nature
of
the
sound
,
it
be
so
slight
and
so
indistinct
.
 
<EOS>
there
it
be
again
!
<EOS>
some
person
be
move
about
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
the
sound
that
come
upon
the
night
air
seem
to
say
that
there
be
an
unusual
bustle
in
the
town
,
which
be
,
to
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
ominous
in
the
extreme
.
 
<EOS>
what
could
people
in
such
a
quiet
,
retired
place
require
out
at
such
an
hour
at
night
?
<EOS>
It
must
be
something
very
unusual
--
something
that
must
excite
them
to
a
great
degree
;
and
Sir
Francis
begin
to
feel
very
uneasy
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
surely
,
"
he
mutter
to
himself--"they
surely
can
not
have
find
out
my
hiding
place
,
and
intend
to
hunt
me
from
it
,
the
blood
-
thirsty
hound
!
<EOS>
they
be
never
satisfied
.
<EOS>
the
mischief
they
be
permit
to
do
on
one
occasion
be
but
the
precursor
to
another
.
<EOS>
the
taste
have
cause
the
appetite
for
more
,
and
nothing
short
of
his
blood
can
satisfy
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
sound
increase
,
and
the
noise
come
nearer
and
nearer
,
and
it
appear
as
though
a
number
of
man
have
collect
together
and
be
come
towards
him
.
<EOS>
yes
,
they
be
come
down
the
lane
towards
the
deserted
mansion
where
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
for
once
in
his
life
,
Sir
Francis
Varney
tremble
;
he
feel
sick
at
heart
,
though
no
man
be
less
likely
to
give
up
hope
and
to
despair
than
he
;
yet
this
sign
of
unrelenting
hatred
and
persecution
be
too
unequivocal
and
too
stern
not
to
produce
its
effect
upon
even
his
mind
;
for
he
have
no
doubt
but
that
they
be
come
with
the
express
purpose
of
seek
him
.
 
<EOS>
how
they
could
have
find
him
out
be
a
matter
he
could
not
imagine
.
<EOS>
the
bannerworth
could
not
have
betray
him
--
he
be
sure
of
that
;
and
yet
who
could
have
see
him
,
so
cautious
and
so
careful
as
he
have
be
,
and
so
very
sparing
<EOS>
have
he
live
,
because
he
would
not
give
the
slight
cause
for
all
that
be
about
to
follow
.
<EOS>
He
hope
to
have
hide
himself
;
but
now
he
could
hear
the
tramp
of
man
distinctly
,
and
their
voice
come
now
on
the
night
air
,
though
it
be
in
a
subdued
tone
,
as
if
they
be
desirous
of
approach
unheard
and
unseen
by
their
victim
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
stir
not
from
his
position
.
<EOS>
He
remain
silent
and
motionless
.
<EOS>
He
appear
not
to
heed
what
be
go
on
;
perhaps
he
hope
to
see
them
go
by
--
to
be
upon
some
false
scent
;
or
,
if
they
see
no
sign
of
life
,
they
may
leave
the
place
,
and
go
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
Hark
!
<EOS>
they
stop
at
the
house
--
they
go
not
by
;
they
seem
to
pause
,
and
then
a
thundering
knock
come
at
the
door
,
which
echo
and
re
-
echo
through
the
empty
and
deserted
house
,
on
the
top
of
which
sit
,
in
silent
expectation
,
the
almost
motionless
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
the
redoubte
vampyre
.
 
<EOS>
the
knock
which
come
so
loud
and
so
hard
upon
the
door
cause
Sir
 
Francis
to
start
visibly
,
for
it
seem
his
own
knell
.
<EOS>
then
,
as
if
the
mob
be
satisfied
with
their
knowledge
of
his
presence
,
and
of
their
victory
,
and
of
his
inability
to
escape
them
,
they
send
up
a
loud
shout
that
fill
the
whole
neighbourhood
with
its
sound
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
come
from
below
and
around
the
house
;
it
rise
from
all
side
,
and
that
tell
Sir
Francis
Varney
that
the
house
be
surround
and
all
escape
be
cut
off
;
there
be
no
chance
of
his
be
able
to
rush
through
such
a
multitude
of
man
as
that
which
now
encircle
him
.
 
<EOS>
with
the
calm
despair
,
Sir
Francis
Varney
lie
still
and
motionless
on
the
house
-
top
,
and
listen
to
the
sound
that
proceed
from
below
.
<EOS>
shout
after
shout
arise
on
the
still
,
calm
air
of
the
night
;
knock
after
knock
come
upon
the
stout
old
door
,
which
awaken
responsive
echo
throughout
the
house
that
have
for
many
year
lain
dormant
,
and
which
now
seem
disturbed
,
and
resound
in
hollow
murmur
to
the
voice
from
without
.
 
<EOS>
then
a
loud
voice
shout
from
below
,
as
if
to
be
hear
by
any
one
who
may
be
within,--
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
the
vampyre
,
come
out
and
give
yourself
up
at
discretion
!
<EOS>
if
we
have
to
search
for
you
,
you
may
depend
it
will
be
to
punish
you
;
you
will
suffer
by
burn
.
<EOS>
come
out
and
give
yourself
up
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
pause
,
and
then
a
loud
shout
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
pay
no
attention
to
this
summon
,
but
sit
,
motionless
,
on
the
house
-
top
,
where
he
could
hear
all
that
pass
below
in
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
will
not
come
out
,
"
say
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
he
be
much
too
cunning
to
be
catch
in
such
a
trap
.
<EOS>
why
,
he
know
what
you
would
do
with
him
;
he
know
you
would
stake
him
,
and
make
a
bonfire
about
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
he
have
no
taste
for
roasting
,
"
remark
another
;
"
but
still
,
it
be
no
use
hiding
;
we
have
too
many
hand
,
and
know
the
house
too
well
to
be
easily
baffle
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
may
be
;
and
,
although
he
do
not
like
burn
,
yet
we
will
unearth
the
old
fox
,
somehow
or
other
;
we
have
discover
his
haunt
at
last
,
and
certainly
we
will
have
him
out
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
shall
we
get
in
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
knock
in
the
door
--
break
open
the
door
!
<EOS>
the
front
door
--
that
be
the
good
,
because
it
lead
to
all
part
of
the
house
,
and
we
can
secure
any
one
who
attempt
to
move
from
one
to
the
other
,
as
they
come
down
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hurrah
!
"
shout
several
man
in
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hurrah
!
"
echo
the
mob
,
with
one
accord
,
and
the
shout
rent
the
air
,
and
disturb
the
quietude
and
serenity
that
scarce
five
minute
before
reign
through
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
as
if
actuate
by
one
spirit
,
they
all
set
to
work
to
force
the
door
in
.
<EOS>
It
be
strong
,
and
capable
of
great
defence
,
and
employ
them
,
with
some
labour
,
for
fifteen
or
twenty
minute
,
and
then
,
with
a
loud
crash
,
the
door
fall
in
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hurrah
!
"
again
shout
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
these
shout
announce
the
fall
of
the
door
,
and
then
,
and
not
until
then
,
do
Sir
Francis
Varney
stir
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
have
break
in
the
door
,
"
he
mutter
,
"
well
,
if
die
<EOS>
I
must
,
I
will
sell
my
life
dearly
.
<EOS>
however
,
all
be
not
yet
lose
,
and
,
in
the
struggle
for
life
,
the
loss
be
not
so
much
feel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
get
up
,
and
creep
towards
the
trap
that
lead
into
the
house
,
or
out
of
it
,
as
the
occasion
may
require
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
vampyre

<EOS>
the
vampyre

shout
a
man
who
stand
on
a
garden
wall

hold
on
by
the
arm
of
an
apple

a
second

<EOS>
"
Hurrah

now
for
a
hunt

hurrah

we
shall
have
him
now

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
rush
in
a
tumultuous
riot
up
the
stone
step
,
and
into
the
hall
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
large
,
spacious
place
,
with
a
grand
staircase
that
lead
up
to
the
upper
floor
,
but
it
have
two
end
,
and
then
terminate
in
a
gallery
.
 
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
defend
by
one
man
,
save
at
the
top
,
where
it
could
not
long
be
hold
,
because
the
assailant

unite
,
and
throw
their
whole
weight
against
the
entrance
,
and
thus
storm
it
.
<EOS>
this
actually
happen
.
 
<EOS>
They
look
up
,
and
,
see
nobody
,
they
rush
up
,
some
by
one
stair
,
and
some
by
the
other
;
but
it
be
dark
;
there
be
but
few
of
the
moon
's
ray
that
pierce
the
gloom
of
that
place
,
and
those
who
first
reach
the

with
astonishment
,
stagger
,
and
fall

<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
have
meet
them
;
he
stand
there
with
a
staff
--
something
he
have
find
about
the
house
--
not
quite
so
long
as
a
broom
-
handle
,
but
somewhat
thick
and
heavier
,
be
make
of
stout
ash
.
 
<EOS>
this
formidable
weapon
,
Sir
Francis
Varney
wield
with
strength
and
resolution
;
he
be
a
tall
man
,
and
one
of
no
mean
activity
and
personal
strength
,
and
such
a
weapon
,
in
his
hand
,
be
one
of
a
most
fearful
character
,
and
,
for
the
occasion
,
much
well
than
his
sword
.
 
<EOS>
man
after
man
fall
beneath
the
fearful
brace
of
these
blow
,
for
though
they
could
not
see
Sir
Francis
,
yet
he
could
see
them
,
or
the
hall
-
light
be
behind
them
at
the
time
,
while
he
stand
in
the
dark
,
and
take
advantage
of
this
to
deal
murderous
blow
upon
his
assailant
.
 
<EOS>
this
continue
for
some
minute
,
till
they
give
way
before
such
a
vigorous
defence
,
and
pause
.
 
<EOS>
"
on
,
neighbour
,
on
,
"
cry
one
;
"
will
you
be
beat
off
by
one
man
?
<EOS>
rush
in
at
once
<EOS>
and
you
must
force
him
from
his
position
--
push
him
hard
,
and
he
must
give
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
"
say
one
fellow
who
sit
upon
the
ground
rub
his
head
;
"
it
be
all
very
well
to
say
push
him
hard
,
but
if
you
feel
the
weight
of
that
d----d
pole
on
your
head
,
you
would
not
be
in
such
a
bless
hurry
.
"
 
<EOS>
however
true
that
may
be
,
there
be
but
little
attention
pay
to
it
,
and
a
determined
rush
be
make
at
the
entrance
to
the
gallery
,
and
they
find
that
it
be
unoccupied
;
and
that
be
explain
by
the
slamming
of
a
door
,
and
its
be
immediately
lock
upon
them
;
and
when
the
mob
come
to
the
door
,
they
find
they
have
to
break
their
way
through
another
door
.
 
<EOS>
this
do
not
take
long
in
effect
;
and
in
less
than
five
minute
they
have
break
through
that
door
which
lead
into
another
room
;
but
the
first
man
who
enter
it
fall
from
a
crash
blow
on
the
head
from
the
ashen
staff
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
who
hurry
and
flee
,
closely
pursue
,
until
he
come
to
another
door
,
through
which
he
dash
.
 
<EOS>
here
he
endeavour
to
make
a
stand
and
close
it
,
but
be
immediately
strike
and
grapple
with
;
but
he
throw
his
assailant
,
and
turn
and
flee
again
.
 
<EOS>
His
object
have
be
to
defend
each
inch
of
the
ground
as
long
as
he
be
able
;
but
he
find
they
come
too
close
upon
his
step
,
and
prevent
his
turning
in
time
to
try
the
strength
of
his
staff
upon
the
foremost
.
 
<EOS>
He
dash
up
the
first
staircase
with
surprising
rapidity
,
leave
his
pursuer
behind
;
and
when
he
have
gain
the
first
landing
,
he
turn
upon
those
who
pursue
him
,
who
could
hardly
follow
him
two
abreast
.
 
<EOS>
"
down
with
the
vampyre
!
"
shout
the
first
,
who
rush
up
heedless
of
the
staff
.
 
<EOS>
"
down

"
thunder
Varney
,
as
he
strike
the
fellow
a
terrific
blow
,
which
cover
his
face
with
blood
,
and
he
fall
back
into
the
arm
of
his
companion
.
 
<EOS>
a
bitter
groan
and
execration
arise
from
them
below
,
and
again
they
shout
,
and
rush
up
headlong
.
 
<EOS>
"
down

the

"
be
again
shout
,
and
meet
by
a
corresponding
,
but
deep
guttural
sound
of--
 
"
down
with

"
 
<EOS>
and
sure
enough
the
first
again
come
to
the
earth
without
any
preparation
,
save
the
application
of
an
ashen
stick
to
his
skull
,
which
,
by
-
the

bye
<EOS>
,
no
means
aid
the
operation
of
thinking

<EOS>
several
more
share
a
similar
fate
;
but
they
press
hard
,
and
Sir
Francis
be
compel
to
give
ground
to
keep
them
at
the
necessary
length
from
him
,
as
they
rush
on
regardless
of
his
blow
,
and
if
he
have
not
he
would
soon
have
be
engage
in
a
personal
struggle
,
for
they
be
get
too
close
for
him
to
use
the
staff
.
 
<EOS>
"
down
with
the
vampyre

"
be
the
renew
cry
,
as
they
drive
him
from
spot
to
spot
until
he
reach
the
roof
of
the
house
,
and
then
he
run
up
the
step
to
the
loft
,
which
he
have
just
reach
when
they
come
up
to
the
bottom
.
 
<EOS>
Varney
attempt
to
draw
the
ladder
up
but
four
or
five
stout
man
hold
that
down
;
then
by
a
sudden
turn
,
as
they
be
get
up
,
he
turn
it
over
,
throw
those
on
it
down
,
and
the
ladder
too
,
upon
the
head
of
those
who
be
below

<EOS>
"
down
with
the
vampyre

"
shout
the
mob
,
as
they
,
with
the
most
untiring
energy
,
set
the
ladder
,
or
step
,
against
the
loft
,
and
as
many
as
could
hold
it
,
while
other
rush
up
to
attack
Varney
with
all
the
ferocity
and
courage
of
so
many
bull
dog
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
strange
,
but
the
more
they
be
baffle
the
more
enraged
and
determine
they
rush
on
to
a
new
attack
,
with
great
resolution
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
,
however
,
they
be
meet
with
a
new
kind
of
missile
,
for
Sir
Francis
have
either
collect
and
place
there
for
the
occasion
,
or
they
have
be
leave
there
for
year
,
a
number
of
old
brick
,
which
lie
close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
these
he
take
,
one
by
one
,
and
deliberately
take
aim
at
them
,
and
fling
them
with
great
force
,
strike
down
every
one
they
hit
.
 
<EOS>
this
cause
them
to
recoil
;
the
brick
cause
fearful
gash
in
their
head
,
and
the
wound
be
serious
,
the
flesh
be
,
in
many
place
,
tear
completely
off
.
<EOS>
They
however
,
only
pause
,
for
one
man
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
be
of
good
heart
,
comrade
,
we
can
do
as
he
do
;
he
have
furnish
us
with
weapon
,
and
we
can
thus
attack
him
in
two
way
,
and
he
must
give
way
in
the
end
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hurrah
!
<EOS>
down
with
the
vampyre
!
"
sound
from
all
side
,
and
the
shout
be
answer
by
a
corresponding
rush
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
;
Sir
Francis
have
furnish
them
with
weapon
to
attack
himself
,
for
they
could
throw
them
back
at
him
,
which
they
do
,
and
strike
him
a
severe
blow
on
the
head
,
and
it
cover
his
face
with
blood
in
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hurrah
!
"
shout
the
assailant
;
"
another
such
a
blow
,
and
all
will
be
over
with
the
vampyre

"
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
got--
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
press
him
sharp
,
now
,
"
cry
another
man
,
as
he
aim
another
blow
with
a
brick
,
which
strike
Varney
on
the
arm
,
cause
him
to
drop
the
brick
he
hold
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
stagger
back
,
apparently
in
great
pain
.
 
<EOS>
"
up
!
<EOS>
up
!
<EOS>
we
have
him
now
;
he
can
not
get
away
;
he
be
hurt
;
we
have
him
--
we
have
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
up
they
go
with
all
the
rapidity
they
could
scramble
up
the
step
;
but
this
have
give
Varney
time
to
recover
himself
;
and
though
his
right
arm
be
almost
useless
,
yet
he
contrive
,
with
his
left
,
to
pitch
the
brick
so
as
to
knock
over
the
first
three
or
four
,
<EOS>
when
,
see
that
he
could
not
maintain
his
position
to
advantage
,
he
rush
to
the
outside
of
the
house
,
the
last
place
he
have
capable
of
defence
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
shout
by
those
outside
,
when
they
see
him
come
out
and
stand
with
his
staff
,
and
those
who
come
first
get
first
serve
,
for
the
blow
resound
,
while
he
strike
them
,
and
send
them
over
below
.
 
<EOS>
then
come
a
great
shout
from
within
and
without
,
and
then
a
desperate
rush
be
make
at
the
door
,
and
,
in
the
next
instant
,
Varney
be
see
fly
,
follow
by
his
pursuer
,
one
after
the
other
,
some
tumble
over
the
tile
,
to
the
imminent
hazard
of
their
neck
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
rush
along
with
a
speed
that
appear
by
far
too
great
to
admit
of
be
safely
follow
,
and
yet
those
who
follow
appear
infect
by
his
example
,
and
appear
heedless
of
all
consequence
by
which
their
pursuit
may
be
attend
to
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hurrah
!
"
shout
the
mob
below
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hurrah
!
"
answer
the
mob
on
the
tile
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
over
several
housetop
may
be
see
the
flying
figure
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
pursue
by
different
man
at
a
pace
almost
equal
to
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
They
,
however
,
could
keep
up
the
same
speed
,
and
not
improve
upon
it
,
while
he
keep
the
advantage
he
first
obtain
in
the
start
.
 
<EOS>
then
suddenly
he
disappear
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
the
spectator
below
that
he
have
drop
through
a
house
,
and
they
immediately
surround
the
house
,
as
well
as
they
could
,
and
then
set
up
another
shout
.
 
<EOS>
this
take
place
several
time
,
and
as
often
be
the
miserable
man
hunt
from
his
place
of
refuge
only
to
seek
another
,
from
which
he
be
in
like
manner
hunt
by
those
who
thirst
for
his
blood
.
 
<EOS>
on
one
occasion
,
they
drive
him
into
a
house
which
be
surround
,
save
at
one
point
,
which
have
a
long
room
,
or
building
in
it
,
that
run
some
distance
out
,
and
about
twenty
foot
high
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
entrance
to
the
roof
of
this
place
,
or
lead
,
he
stand
and
defend
himself
for
some
moment
with
success
;
but
have
receive
a
blow
himself
,
he
be
compel
to
retire
,
while
the
mob
behind
force
those
in
front
forward
faster
than
he
could
by
any
exertion
wield
the
staff
that
have
so
much
befriend
him
on
this
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
,
therefore
,
on
the
point
of
be
overwhelm
by
number
,
when
he
flee
;
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
there
be
no
escape
;
a
bare
cope
stone
and
rail
run
round
the
top
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
much
time
for
hesitation
,
but
he
jump
over
the
rail
and
look
below
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
height
,
but
if
he
fall
and
hurt
himself
,
he
know
he
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
bloodhound
behind
him
,
who
would
do
anything
but
show
him
any
mercy
,
or
spare
him
a
single
pang
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
round
and
beheld
his
pursuer
close
upon
him
,
and
one
be
so
close
to
him
that
he
seize
upon
his
arm
,
say
,
as
he
shout
to
his
companions,--
 
"
Hurrah
,
boy
!
<EOS>
I
have
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
with
an
execration
,
Sir
Francis
wield
his
staff
with
such
force
,
that
he
strike
the
fellow
on
the
head
,
crush
in
his
hat
as
if
it
have
be
only
so
much
paper
.
<EOS>
the
man
fall
,
but
a
blow
follow
from
some
one
else
which
cause
Varney
to
relax
his
hold
,
and
find
himself
fall
,
he
,
to
save
himself
,
spring
away
.
 
<EOS>
the
rail
,
at
that
moment
,
be
crowd
with
man
who
lean
over
to
ascertain
the
effect
of
the
leap
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
will
be
kill
,
"
say
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
sure
to
be
smash
,
"
say
another
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
lay
any
wager
<EOS>
he
will
break
a
limb
!
"
say
a
third
.
 
<EOS>
Varney
come
to
the
earth
--
for
a
moment
he
lie
stunned
,
and
not
able
to
move
hand
or
foot
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hurrah
!
"
shout
the
mob
.
 
<EOS>
Their
triumph
be
short
,
for
just
as
they
shout
Varney
arise
,
and
after
a
moment
or
two
's
stagger
he
set
off
at
full
speed
,
which
produce
another
shout
from
the
mob
;
and
just
at
that
moment
,
a
body
of
his
pursuer
be
see
scale
the
wall
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
now
a
hunt
through
all
the
adjoining
field
--
<EOS>
from
cover
after
cover
they
pursue
him
until
he
find
no
rest
from
the
hungry
wolf
that
beset
him
with
cry
,
resemble
beast
of
prey
rather
than
any
human
multitude
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
hear
them
,
at
the
same
time
,
with
the
despair
of
a
man
who
be
struggle
for
life
,
and
yet
know
he
be
struggle
in
vain
;
he
know
his
strength
be
decay
--
<EOS>
his
immense
exertion
and
the
blow
he
have
receive
,
all
weaken
him
,
while
the
number
and
strength
of
his
foe
seem
rather
to
increase
than
to
diminish
.
 
<EOS>
once
more
he
seek
the
house
,
and
for
a
moment
he
believe
himself
safe
,
but
that
be
only
a
momentary
deception
,
for
they
have
trace
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
arrive
at
a
garden
wall
,
over
which
he
bound
,
and
then
he
rush
into
the
house
,
the
door
of
which
stand
open
,
for
the
noise
and
disturbance
have
awaken
most
of
the
inhabitant
,
who
be
out
in
all
direction
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
refuge
in
a
small
closet
on
the
stair
,
but
be
see
to
do
so
by
a
girl
,
who
scream
out
with
fear
and
fright
,
 
"
murder
!
<EOS>
murder!--the
wampyre!--the
wampyre
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
with
all
her
strength
,
and
in
the
way
of
scream
that
be
no
little
,
and
then
she
go
off
into
a
fit
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
signal
enough
,
and
the
house
be
at
once
enter
,
and
beset
on
all
side
by
the
mob
,
who
come
impatient
of

the

"
I

him

<EOS>
Sir
Francis

find
himself
betray
,
immediately
come
out
of
the
closet
,
just
as
two
or
three
be
advance
to
open
it
,
and
deal
so
hard
a
blow
on
the
head
of
the

that
come
near
him
that
he
fall
without
a
groan

and
a
second

the

fate

and
then
Sir
Francis
find
himself
grapple
with
,
but
with
a
violent
effort
he
relieve
himself
and
rush
up
stair
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
murder
--
the
wampyre

<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
--
fire
--
fire
!
"
 
<EOS>
these
exclamation
be
utter
in
consequence
of
Varney
in
his
haste
to
get
up
stair
,
have
inadvertently
step
into
the
girl
's
lap
with
one
foot
,
while
he
kick
her
in
the
chin
with
the
other
,
besides
scratch
her
nose
till
it
bleed
.
 
<EOS>
"
after
him
--
stick
to
him
,
"
shout
the
mob
,
but
the
girl
kick
and
sprawl
so
much
they
be
impede
,
till
,
regardless
of
her
cry
,
they
run
over
her
and
pursue
Varney
,
who
be
much
distressed
with
the
exertion
he
have
make
.
 
<EOS>
after
about
a
minute
's
race
he
turn
upon
the
head
of
the
stair
,
not
so
much
with
the
hope
of
defend
it
as
of
take
some
breathing
time
:
but
see
his
enemy
so
close
,
he
draw
his
sword
,
and
stand
pant
,
but
prepare
.
 
<EOS>
"
never
mind
his
toasting
-
fork
,
"
say
one
bulky
fellow
,
and
,
as
he
speak
,
he
rush
on
,
but
the
point
of
the
weapon
enter
his
heart
and
he
fall
dead
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
dreadful
execration
utter
by
those
who
come
up
after
him
,
and
there
be
a
momentary
pause
,
for
none
like
to
rush
on
to
the
bloody
sword
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
who
stand
so
willing
and
so
capable
of
use
it
with
the
most
deadly
effect
.
<EOS>
They
pause
,
as
well
they
may
,
and
this
pause
be
the
most
welcome
thing
next
to
life
to
the
unfortunate
fugitive
,
for
he
be
dreadfully
distressed
and
bleed
.
 
<EOS>
"
on
to
him
boy
!
<EOS>
He
can
hardly
stand
.
<EOS>
see
how
he
pant
.
<EOS>
on
to
him
,
I

--
push
him
hard

"
 
<EOS>
"
He
push
hard
,
I
tell
you
,
"
say
another
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
the
point
of
his
sword
,
as
it
come
through
Giles

back
.

.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
my
luck
,
then

say
another
,
and
he
rush
up
;
but
he
be
meet
by
the
sword
of
Sir
Francis
,
who
pierce
it
through
his
side
,
and
he
fall
back
with
a
groan
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
,
fearful
of
stop
any
longer
to
defend
that
point
,
appear
desirous
of
make
good
his
retreat
with
some
little
advantage
,
and
he
rush
up
stair
before
they
have
recover
from
the
momentary
consternation
into
which
they
have
be
throw
by
the
sudden
disaster
they
have
receive
.
 
<EOS>
[

<EOS>
but
they
be
quickly
after
him
,
and
before
he
,
weary
as
he
be
,
could
gain
the
roof
,
they
be
up
the
ladder
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
man
who
come
through
the
trap
be
again
set
upon
by
Varney
,
who
make
a
desperate
thrust
at
him
,
and
it
take
effect
;
but
the
sword
snap
by
the
handle
.
 
<EOS>
with
an
execration
,
Sir
Francis
throw
the
hilt
at
the
head
of
the
next
man
he
see
;
then
rush
,
with
headlong
speed
,
he
distance
his
pursuer
for
some
house
top
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
row
of
house
end
at
the
one
he
be
then
at
,
and
he
could
go
no
further
.
<EOS>
what
be
to
be
do
?
<EOS>
the
height
be
by
far
too
great
to
be
jump
;
death
be
certain
.
<EOS>
a
hideous
heap
of
crushed
and
mangle
bone
would
be
the
extent
of
what
would
remain
of
him
,
and
then
,
perhaps
,
life
not
extinct
for
some
hour
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
He
turn
round
;
he
see
them
come
halloo
over
the
house
top
,
like
a
pack
of
hound
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
strike
his
hand
together
,
and
groan
.
<EOS>
He
look
round
,
and
perceive
some
ivy
peep
over
the
coping
-
stone
.
<EOS>
a
thought
strike
him
,
and
he
instantly
run
to
the
spot
and
lean
over
.
 
<EOS>
"
Saved
--
save
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
place
his
hand
over
,
he
feel
for
the
ivy
;
then
he
get
over
,
and
hang
by
the
coping
-
stone
,
in
a
perilous
position
,
till
he
find
a
spot
on
which
he
could
rest
his
foot
,
and
then
he
grasp
the
ivy
as
low
down
as
he
could
,
and
thus
he
lower
himself
a
short
way
,
till
he
come
to
where
the
ivy
be
strong
and
more
secure
to
the
wall
,
as
the
upper
part
be
very
dangerous
with
his
weight
attach
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
mob
come
on
,
very
sure
of
have
Sir
Francis
Varney
in
their
power
,
and
they
do
not
hurry
on
so
violently
,
as
their
position
be
dangerous
at
that
hour
of
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
"
easy
,
boy
,
easy
,
"
be
the
cry
.
<EOS>
"
the
bird
be
our
own
;
he
can
not
get
away
,
that
be
very
certain
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
,
however
,
come
on
,
and
take
no
time
about
it
hardly
;
but
what
be
their
amazement
and
rage
at
find
he
have
disappear
.
 
<EOS>
"
where
be
he
?
<EOS>
"
be
the
universal
inquiry
,
and
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
an
almost
universal
answer
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
long
pause
,
while
they
search
around
;
but
they
see
no
vestige
of
the
object
of
their
search
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
trap
door
open
,
"
remark
one
;
"
and
I
do
not
think
he
could
have
get
in
at
any
one
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
find
he
could
not
get
away
,
he
have
take
the
desperate
expedient
of
jump
over
,
and
commit
suicide
,
and
so
escape
the
doom
he
ought
to
be
subject
to
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
probably
he
have
;
but
then
we
can
run
a
stake
through
him
and
burn
him
all
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
now
approach
the
extreme
verge
of
the
house
,
and
look
over
the
side
,
but
they
could
see
nothing
.
<EOS>
the
moon
be
up
,
and
there
be
light
enough
to
have
see
him
if
he
have
fall
to
the
earth
,
and
they
be
quite
sure
that
he
could
not
have
get
up
after
such
a
fall
as
he
must
have
receive
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
be
beat
after
all
,
neighbour
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
so
sure
of
that
,
"
be
the
reply
.
<EOS>
"
He
may
now
be
hide
about
,
for
he
be
too
far
spend
to
be
able
to
go
far
;
he
could
not
do
that
,
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
either
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
may
he
not
have
escape
by
mean
of
that
ivy
,
yonder
?

say
one
of
the
man
,
point
to
the
plant
,
as
it
climb
over
the
coping

stone
of
the
wall

<EOS>
"
yes
;
it
may
be
possible
,
"
say
one
;
"

yet
it
be
very
dangerous
,
if
not
certain
destruction
to
get
over

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
;
there
be
no
possibility
of
escape
that
way

<EOS>
why
,
it
would
not
bear
a
cat

for
there
be
no
nail
drive
into
the
wall
at
this
height

"
 
<EOS>
"
never

another

"
we
may
as
well
leave
no

at
once
set
about

out
for

"
 
<EOS>
the
individual
who
speak
now
leant
over
the
cope
stone
,
for
some
moment
,
in
silence
.
<EOS>
He
could
see
nothing

yet
he
continue
to
gaze
for
some
moment
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you

inquire
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
no

"
be
the
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
,
I
think
as
much
,

be
the
reply
.
"
<EOS>
He
may
as
well
have
get
hold
of
a
corner
of
the
moon
,
which
,
I
believe
,
be
more
likely
--
a
great
deal
more
likely

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
hold
still
a
moment
,
"
say
the
man
,
who
be
look
over
the
edge
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
now
?
<EOS>
a
gnat
fly
into
your
eye
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no

I

him

by

I
see
him

see
who

see
who
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Varney
,
the
vampyre
!
"
shout
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
him
about
half
-
way
down
cling
,
like
a
fly
,
to
the
wall

odd
zounds
!
<EOS>
I
never

<EOS>
"
Hurrah

after
him
then

<EOS>
"
not
the

you

yourself

<EOS>
"
just

so
it

cuss
me

"
 
<EOS>
the
man
make
no
reply
,
but
do
as
Varney
have
do
before
,
get
over
the
cope
stone
,
and
then
lay
hold
of
the
ivy
;
but
,
whether
his
weight
be
heavy
than
Varney
's
,
or
whether
it
be
that
the
latter
have
loosen
the
hold
of
the
ivy
or
not
,
but
he
have
no
sooner
leave
go
of
the
cope
stone
than
the
ivy
give
way
,
and
he
be
precipitate
from
the
height
of
about
fifty
foot
to
the
earth
--
a
dreadful
fall
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
pause
--
no
one
speak
.
<EOS>
the
man
lie
motionless
and
dead
--
he
have
dislocate
his
neck
!
 
<EOS>
the
fall
have
not
,
however
,
be
without
its
effect
upon
Varney
,
for
the
man
's
heel
strike
him
so
forcibly
on
his
head
as
he
fall
,
that
he
be
stunned
,
and
let
go
his
hold
,
and
he
,
too
,
fall
to
the
earth
,
but
not
many
foot
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
recover
himself
,
and
be
stagger
away
,
when
he
be
assail
by
those
above
with
groan
,
and
curse
of
all
kind
,
and
then
by
stone
,
and
tile
,
and
whatever
<EOS>
the
mob
could
lay
their
hand
upon
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
these
strike
him
,
and
he
be
cut
about
in
various
place
,
so
that
he
could
hardly
stand
.
 
<EOS>
the
hoot
and
shout
of
the
mob
above
have
now
attract
those
below
to
the
spot
where
Sir
Francis
Varney
be
try
to
escape
,
but
he
have
not
go
far
before
the
loud
yell
of
those
behind
him
tell
him
that
he
be
again
pursue
.
 
<EOS>
half
dead
,
and
almost
wholly
spend
,
unarmed
,
and
defenceless
,
he
scarce
know
what
to
do
;
whether
to
fly
,
or
to
turn
round
and
die
as
a
refuge
from
the
great
evil
of
endeavour
to
prolong
a
struggle
which
seem
hopeless
.
<EOS>
Instinct
,
however
,
urge
him
on
,
at
all
risk
,
and
though
he
could
not
go
very
far
,
or
fast
,
yet
on
he
go
,
with
the
crowd
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
down
with
the
vampyre!--seize
him

hold
him
--
burn
him
!

he
must
be
down
presently

he

not

"
 
<EOS>
this
give
them
new
hope
,
and
render
Varney
's
fate
almost
certain
.
<EOS>
They
renew
their
exertion
to
overtake
him
,
while
he
exert
himself
anew
,
and
with
surprising
agility
,
consider
how
he
have
be
employ
for
more
than
two
hour
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
some
tree
and
hedge
now
<EOS>
that
oppose
the
progress
of
both
party
.
<EOS>
the
height
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
give
him
a
great
advantage
,
and
,
have
he
be
fresh
,
he
may
have
show
it
to
advantage
in
vault
over
the
hedge
and
ditch
,
which
he
jump
when
oblige
,
and
walk
through
when
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
the
party
in
pursuit
,
who
have
be
behind
him
some
distance
,
now
they
gain
on
him
;
however
,
they
keep
,
every
now
and
then
,
lose
sight
of
him
among
the
tree
and
shrub
,
and
he
make
direct
for
a
small
wood
,
hope
that
when
there
,
he
should
to
be
able
to
conceal
himself
for
some
time
,
so
as
to
throw
his
pursuer
off
the
track
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
well
aware
of
this
,
for
they
increase
their
speed
,
and
one
or
two
swifter
of
foot
than
the
other
,
get
a
-
head
of
them
and
cry
out
aloud
as
they
ran,--
 
<EOS>
"
keep
up
!
<EOS>
keep
up
!
<EOS>
he
be
make
for
the
wood
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
can
not
stop
there
long
;
there
be

many
of
us
to
beat
that
cover
without

push

as
sure

<EOS>
They
do
push
on
,
and
come
in
full
sight
as
they
see
Sir
Francis
enter
the
wood
,
with
what
speed
he
could
make
;
but
he
be
almost
spend
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
cheer
sight
to
them
,
and
they
be
pretty
certain
he
would
not
leave
the
wood
in
the
state
<EOS>
he
be
then
--
he
must
seek
concealment

they
be
mistaken

for
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
as
soon
as
he
get
into
the
wood
,
plunge
into
the
thick
of
it
,
and
then
pause
to
gain
breath
.
 
<EOS>
"
so
far
safe
,
"
he
mutter
;
"
but
I
have
have
a
narrow
escape
;
they
be
not
yet
do
,
though
,
and
it
will
not
be
safe
here
long
.
<EOS>
I
must
away
,
and
seek
shelter
and
safety
elsewhere
,
if
I
can;--curse
<EOS>
on
the
hound
that
run
yelp
over
the
field
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
hear
the
shout
of
his
pursuer
,
and
prepare
to
quit
the
wood
when
he
think
the
first
have
enter
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
will
remain
here
some
time
in
beat
about
,
"
he
mutter
;
"
that
be
the
only
chance
I
have
have
since
the
pursuit
;
curse
them
!
<EOS>
I
say
again
.
<EOS>
I
may
now
get
free
;
this
delay
must
save
my
life
,
but
nothing
else
will
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
move
away
,
and
,
at
a
slow
and
lazy
pace
,
leave
the
wood
,
and
then
make
his
way
across
some
field
,
towards
some
cottage
,
that
lie
on
the
left
.
 
<EOS>
the
moon
yet
shine
on
the
field
;
he
could
hear
the
shout
of
the
mob
,
as
various
party
go
through
the
wood
from
one
covert
to
another
,
and
yet
unable
to
find
him
.
 
<EOS>
then
come
a
great
shout
upon
his
ear
,
as
though
they
have
find
out
he
have
leave
the
wood
.
<EOS>
this
cause
him
to
redouble
his
speed
,
and
,
fearful
lest
he
should
be
see
in
the
moonlight
,
he
leap
over
the
first
fence
that
he
come
to
,
with
almost
the
last
effort
he
could
make
,
and
then
stagger
in
at
an
open
door
--
through
a
passage
--
into
a
front
parlour
,
and
there
fall
,
faint
,
and
utterly
spend
and
speechless
,
at

CHAPTER

<EOS>
the
reception
of
the
VAMPYRE
by
FLORA.--VARNEY
SUBDUED
.
  
<EOS>
[

]
 
<EOS>
We
must
say
that
the
irruption
into
the
house
of
the
Bannerworths
by
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
be
certainly
unpremeditated
by
him
,
for
he
know
not
into
whose
house
he
have
thus
suddenly
rush
for
refuge
from
the
numerous
foe
who
be
pursue
him
with
such
vengeful
ire
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
strange
and
singular
incident
,
and
one
well
calculate
to
cause
the
mind
to
pause
before
it
pass
it
by
,
and
consider
the
mean
to
an
end
which
be
sometimes
as
wide
of
the
mark
,
as
it
be
in
nature
possible
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
but
truth
be
strong
than
fiction
by
far
,
and
the
end
of
it
be
,
that
,
press
on
all
side
by
danger
,
bleeding
,
faint
,
and
exhausted
,
he
rush
into
the
first
house
he
come
to
,
and
thus
place
himself
in
the
very
house
of
those
whom
he
have
bring
to
such
a
state
of
misfortune
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
Bannerworth
be
seat
at
some
embroidery
,
to
pass
away
an
hour
or
so
,
and
thus
get
over
the
tedium
of
time
;
she
be
not
think
,
either
,
upon
the
unhappy
past
;
some
trifling
object
or
other
engage
her
attention
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
her
anguish
when
she
see
a
man
stagger
into
the
room
bleed
,
and
bear
the
mark
of
a
bloody
contest
,
and
sink
at
her
foot
.
 
<EOS>
Her
astonishment
be
far
great
yet
,
when
she
recognise
that
man
to
be
Sir
Francis
Varney
.
 
<EOS>
"
save
me!--save
me
!
<EOS>
Miss
Bannerworth
,
save
me!--only
<EOS>
you
can
save
me
from
the
ruthless
multitude
which
follow
,
cry
aloud
for
my
blood
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
as
he
speak
,
he
sink
down
speechless
.
<EOS>
Flora
be
so
much
amazed
,
not
to
say
terrified
,
that
she
know
not
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
She
see
Sir
Francis
a
suppliant
at
her
foot
,
a
fugitive
from
his
enemy
,
who
would
show
him
no
mercy
--
she
see
all
this
at
a
moment
's
glance
;
and
yet
she
have
not
recover
her
speech
and
presence
of
mind
enough
to
enable
her
to
make
any
reply
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
save
me
!
<EOS>
Miss
Flora
Bannerworth
,
save
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
again
say
,
raise
himself
on
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
beset
,
hunt
like
a
wild
beast
--
they
seek
my
life
--
they
have
pursue
me
from
one
spot
to
another
,
and
I
have
unwittingly
intrude
upon
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
save
me
:
I
be
sure
your
kindness
and
goodness
of
heart
will
never
permit
me
to
be
turn
out
among
such
a
crew
of
blood
-
thirsty
butcher
as
those
who
pursue
me
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
rise
,
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
"
say
Flora
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
;
"
in
such
an
extremity
as
that
which
you
be
in
,
it
would
be
inhuman
indeed
to
thrust
you
out
among
your
enemy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
<EOS>
it
would
,
"
say
Varney
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
think
,
until
now
,
I
could
have
face
such
a
mob
,
until
I
be
in
this
extremity
;
and
then
,
disarm
and
throw
down
,
bruise
,
beat
,
and
incapable
of
stem
such
a
torrent
,
I
flee
from
one
place
to
another

till
hunt
from
each

and
then
instinct
alone
urge
me
to
great
exertion
than
before

here
I

this
be
now
my
last

only
hope

<EOS>

Sir
Francis

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
not

me
be
tear

slaughter
like
an
ox

<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
will
not

"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
Francis
,
we
be
incapable
of
such
conduct

you
have
seek
refuge
here

both
start

the

Mr.

Sir

,
"
I
be

may
see
by
my

a

Charles
Holland
;
"
I
be
not
one
who
would
feel
any
pleasure
in
see
you
become
the
victim
of
any
brutal
mob

<EOS>
I
be
sure
there
be
none
amongst
us

willingly
do
so

<EOS>
You
have
trust
to
those

not

"
 
<EOS>
"
thank
you

"

Sir
Francis
,
faintly
.
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
;
your
conduct
be
noble
,
and
Miss
Bannerworth
's
especially
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
you
much
hurt
,
Sir
Francis
?
"
inquire
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
much
hurt
,
but
not
seriously
or
dangerously
;
but
I
be
weak
and
exhausted
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
let
me
assist
you
to
rise
,
"
say
Charles
Holland
.
 
<EOS>
"
thank
you

"
say
Sir
Francis
,
as
he
accept
of
the
assistance

when
he
stand
up
,
he
find
how
incapable
he
really
be
,
for
a
child
may
have
grapple
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
sore
beset
,
Mrs.
Bannerworth
,
"
he
say
,
endeavour
to
bow
to
that
lady
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
have
suffer
much
ill
-
usage
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
in
such
a
plight
as
I
could
wish
to
be
see
in
by
lady
;
but
my
reason
for
come
will
be
an
excuse
for
my
appearance
in
such
disorder
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
will
not
say
anything
about
that
,
"
say
Charles
Holland
;
"
under
the
circumstance
,
it
could
not
be
otherwise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
could
not
,
"
say
Sir
Francis
,
as
he
take
the
chair
Miss
Flora
Bannerworth
place
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
ask
you
for
any
explanation
as
to
how
this
come
about
;
but
you
need
some
restorative
and
rest
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
suffer
more
from
exhaustion
than
anything
else

<EOS>
the
bruise
I
have
,
of
course
,
be
not
dangerous
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Can
you
step
aside
a
few
moment
?
"
say
Mrs.
Bannerworth
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
show
you
where
you
can
remove
some
of
those
stain

make
yourself
more
comfortable

<EOS>
"
thank
you

madam
--
thank
you

<EOS>
It
will
be
most
welcome

I
assure
you

"
 
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
rise
up
,
and
,
with
the
aid
of
Charles
Holland
,
he
walk
to
the
next
room
,
where
he
wash
himself
,
and
arrange
his
dress
as
well
as
it
would
admit
of
its
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Holland
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
can
not
tell
you
how
grateful
I
feel
for
this

<EOS>
I
have
be
hunt
from
the
house
where
you
see
me

<EOS>
from
what
source
they
learn
my
abode
--
my
place
of
concealment
--
I
know
not

but
they
find
me
out

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
need
hardly
say
,
Sir
Francis
,
that
it
could
not
have
occur
through
me

"

Charles
Holland
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
young
friend
,
"
say
Sir
Francis
,
"
I
be
quite
sure
you

not

,
moreover
,
I
never

for
one
moment

suspect
you

<EOS>
no
,
no
;
some
accidental
circumstance
alone
have
be
the
cause
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
very
cautious
--
I
may
say
extremely
so
--
but
at
the
same
time
,
live
,
as
I
have
,
surround
by
enemy
on
all
side
,
it
be
not
to
be
wonder
at
that
I
should
be
see
by
some
one

and
thus
trace
to
my
lair
,
whither
they
follow
me
at
their
leisure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
have
be
but
too
troublesome
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
when
they
become
a
little
reasonable
,
it
will
be
a
great
miracle
;
for
,
when
their
passion

fear
be
excited

there
be
no
end

the
extreme
they
will
perpetrate

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
so
,
"
say
Varney
,
"
as
the
history
of
these
last
few
day
<EOS>
amply
testifie
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
could
never
have
credit
the
extent
to
which
popular
excitement
could
be
carry
,
and
the
result
it
be
likely
to
produce
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
an
engine
of
very
difficult
control
,
"
pursue
Charles
Holland
;
"
but
what
will
raise
it
will
not
allay
it
,
but
add
fuel
to
the
fire
that
burn
so
fiercely
already
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
true
enough
,
"
say
Sir
Francis
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
have
do
,
will
you
again
step
this
way
?
"
 
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Varney
follow
Charles
Holland
into
the
sitting
-
room
,
and
sit
down
with
them
,
and
before
him
be
spread
a
light
supper
,
with
some
good
wine
.
 
<EOS>
"
eat
,
Sir
Francis
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bannerworth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
such
a
state
as
that
in
which
you
be
,
must
,
of
necessity
,
produce
great
exhaustion
,
and
you
must
require
food
and
drink

"
 
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
bow
as
well
as
he
be
able
,
and
even
then
,
sore
and
bruise
as
he
be
,
fugitive
as
he
have
be
,
he
could
not
forget
his
courtesy
;
but
it
be
not
without
an
effort
.
<EOS>
His
equanimity
be
,
however
,
much
disturbed
,
by
find
himself
in
the
midst
of
the
Bannerworths
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
owe
you
a
relation
,
"
he
say
,
"
of
what
occur
to
drive
me
from
my
place
of
concealment
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
should
like
to
hear
it
,
if
you
be
not
too
far
fatigued
to
relate
it
,
"
say
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
.
<EOS>
I
be
sit
at
the
top
of
that
house
in
which
I
seek
to
hide
myself
,
when
I
hear
sound
come
that
be
of
a
very
suspicious
nature
;
but
do
not
believe
that
it
could
happen
that
they
have
discover
my
lurking
-
place
;
far
from
it
;
though
,
of
late
,
I
have
be
habitually
cautious
and
suspicious
,
yet
I
think
I
be
safe
,
till
I
hear
the
noise
of
a
multitude
come
towards
me
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
be
mistake
in
it
,
for
the
sound
be
so
peculiar
that
they
be
like
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
I
hear
them
come
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
move
not
;
and
when
they
surround
the
house
as
far
as
be
practicable
,
they
give
an
immense
shout
,
and
make
the
welkin
ring
with
the
sound
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hear
a
confused
noise
at
a
distance
,
"
remark
Flora
;
"
but
I
have
no
idea
that
anything
serious
be
contemplate
.
<EOS>
I
imagine
it
be
some
festival
among
some
trade
,
or
portion
of
the
townspeople
,
who
be
shout
from
joy

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
dear
no

Sir
Francis
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
surprised
at
the
mistake

because
there
be
such
occurrence
occasionally
;

whenever
the
mob
gain
any
advantage
upon
me
they
shout
,

when
I

able

they
groan

most
horribly

<EOS>
"
the
deuce

Charles

suppose

to
encourage

compel
to
fly
from
floor
to
floor
,
until
I
have
reach
the
roof
;
there
they
follow
me
,
and
I
be
compel
again
to
fly
.
<EOS>
house
after
house
they
follow
me
to
,
until
I
could
go
no
farther
,
"
say
Varney
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
escape
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
fortunately
I
see
some
ivy
grow
and
creep
over
the
coping
-
stone
,
and
by
grasp
that
I
get
over
the
side
,
and
so
let
myself
down
by
degree
,
as
well
as
I
be
able
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
good
heaven
!
<EOS>
what
a
dreadful
situation
,
"
exclaim
Flora
;
"
it
be
really
horrible
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
do
it
again
,
under
,
I
think
,
any
circumstance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
the
same
?
"
say
Mrs.
Bannerworth
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
really
doubt
if
I
could
,
"
say
Varney
.
<EOS>
"
the
truth
be
,
the
excitement
of
the
moment
be
great
,
and
I
at
that
moment
thought
of
nothing
but
get
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
same
circumstance
,
the
same
fear
of
death
,
could
hardly
be
produce
in
me
again
,
and
I
be
unable
to
account
for
the
phenomenon
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
escape
be
very
narrow
indeed
,
"
say
Flora
;
"
it
make
me
shudder
to
think
of
the
danger
you
have
go
through
;
it
be
really
terrible
to
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
,
"
say
Sir
Francis
,
"
be
young
and
susceptible
,
and
generous
in
your
disposition
,
You
can
feel
for
me
,
and
do
;
but
how
little
I
could
have
expect
it
,
it
be
impossible
to
say
;
but
your
sympathy
sink
into
my
mind
and
cause
such
emotion
as
never
can
be
erase
from
my
soul
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
You
may
guess
how
dreadful
be
my
position
,
by
the
fact
that
the
first
man
who
attempt
to
get
over
tore
the
ivy
away
and
fall
,
strike
me
in
his
fall
;
he
be
kill
,
and
I
throw
down
and
stunned
.
<EOS>
I
then
make
for
the
wood
,
closely
pursue
and
get
into
it
;
then
I
baffle
them
:
<EOS>
they
search
the
wood
,
and
I
go
through
it
.
<EOS>
I
then
run
across
the
country
to
these
house
here
;
I
get
over
the
fence
,
and
in
at
the
back
door
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
they
see
you
come
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
Charles
Holland
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
,
but
I
think
that
they
do
not
;
I
hear
them
give
a
loud
shout
more
than
once
when
on
this
side
of
the
wood
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
?
<EOS>
how
far
from
here
be
you
when
you
hear
the
shout
?
<EOS>
"
inquire
Mrs.
Bannerworth
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
close
here
;
and
,
as
I
jump
over
the
fence
,
I
hear
them
shout
again
;
but
I
think
they
can
not
see
so
far
;
the
night
be
moonlight
,
to
be
sure
,
but
that
be
all
;
the
shadow
of
the
hedge
,
and
the
distance
together
,
would
make
it
,
if
not
impossible
,
at
least
very
improbable
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
very
likely
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bannerworth
.
 
<EOS>
"
in
that
case
,
"
say
Charles
Holland
,
"
you
be
safe
here
;
for
none
will
suspect
your
being
conceal
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
last
place
I
should
myself
have
think
of
,
"
say
Varney
;
"
and
I
may
say
the
last
place
I
would
knowingly
have
come
to
;
but
have
I
before
know
enough
of
you
,
I
should
have
be
well
assure
of
your
generosity
,
and
have
freely
come
to
claim
your
aid
and
shelter
,
which
accident
have
so
strangely
bring
me
to
be
a
candidate
for
,

which
you
have
so
kindly
award
me

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
night
be
wear
away
,
"
say
Flora
,
"
and
Sir
Francis
be
doubtless
fatigue
to
an
excess
;
sleep
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
will
be
most
welcome
to
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
indeed
,
Miss
Bannerworth
,
"
say
Varney
;
"
but
I
can
do
that
under
any
circumstance
;
do
not
let
me
put
you
to
any
inconvenience
;
a
chair
,
and
at
any
hour
,
will
serve
me
for
sleep
.

"
 
<EOS>
"
We
can
not
do
for
you
what
we
would
wish

Flora
,
look
at
her
mother
;
"
but
something
well
than
that
,
at
all
event
,
we
can
and
will
provide
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
how
to
thank
you
,
"
say
Sir
Francis
Varney
;
"
I
assure
you
,
of
late
I
have
not
be
luxuriously
lodge

and
the
less
trouble
I
give
you
the
great
I
shall
esteem
the
favour

<EOS>
the
hour
be
late
,
and
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
before
another
half
hour
have
elapse
,
be
consign
to
his
own
reflection
,
in
a
small
but
neat
room
,
there
to
repose
his
bruise
and
batter
carcass
,
and
court
the
refreshing
influence
of
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
His
reflection
be
,
for
nearly
an
hour
,
of
the
most
contradictory
character
;
some
one
passion
be
try
to
overcome
the
other
;
but
he
seem
quite
subdued
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
have
expect
this
,
"
he
mutter
;
"
Flora
Bannerworth
have
the
soul
of
a
heroine
.
<EOS>
I
deserve
not
such
a
reception
from
them
;
and
yet
,
in
my
hour
of
utmost
need
,
they
have
receive
me
like
a
favoured
friend
;
and
yet
all
their
misfortune
have
take
their
origin
from
me
;
I
be
the
cause
of
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
fill
with
these
thought
,
he
fall
asleep
;
he
sleep
till
morning
break
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
disturb
;
it
seem
as
though
the
influence
of
sleep
be
sweeter
far
there
,
in
the
cottage
of
the
Bannerworths
,
than
ever
he
have
before
receive
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
late
on
that
morning
before
Sir
Francis
rise
,
and
then
only
through
hear
the
family
about
,
and
,
have
perform
his
toilet
,
so
far
as
circumstance
permit
,
he
descend
,
and
enter
the
front
-
parlour
,
the
room
he
have
be
in
the
night
before

<EOS>
Flora

already
there

indeed

breakfast
be

the
appearance

<EOS>
"

"
good

I
do

Sir

most
sincerely

so

why

"
 
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
do
not
speak
for
a
minute
or
two

and
then
he
say
,
turn
full
upon
Flora--
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
why
,
Miss
Bannerworth

that
I
should
think
so

perhaps
it
be
because
there
be
peculiar
circumstance
connect
with
myself

that
have
make

conscious

Sir

<EOS>
"
not

not

Sir

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
only
a

bruise

so
forth
<EOS>
,
some
of
which
,
as
you
may
perceive
,
do
not
add
to

a

<EOS>
"
I
wish
they
be
as
easily
get
rid
of
myself

"
say
Charles

"
but
as
that

I

they

if
the

I

the
breakfast
be
pass
off
in
pleasing
conversation

and
Varney
find
himself
much
at
home
with
the
Bannerworths
,
whose
calm
and
even
tenour
be
quite
new
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
but
admit
the
charm
of
such
a
life
as
that
lead
by
the
bannerworth
;
but
what
it
must
have
be
when
they
be
supply
by
ample
mean
,
with
nothing
to
prey
upon
their
mind
,
and
no
fearful
mystery
to
hang
on
and
weigh
down
their
spirit
,
he
could
scarcely
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
amiable
,
accomplished
;
they
be
in
the
same
mind
at
all
time
,
and
nothing
seem
to
ruffle
them
;
and
when
night
come
,
he
could
not
but
acknowledge
to
himself
that
he
have
never
form
half
the
opinion
of

they

<EOS>
of
course
during
that
day
he
be
compel
to
lie
close
,
so
as
not
to
be
see
by
any
one

save
the
family

<EOS>
He
sit
in
a
small
room
,
which
be
overlook
by
no
other
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
he
remain
quiet
,
sometimes
converse
,
and
sometimes
read
,
but
at
the
same
time
ever
attentive
to
the
least
sound
that
appear
at
all
of
a
character
to
indicate
the
approach
of
person
for
any
purpose
whatever

<EOS>
at
supper
time
he
speak
to
Flora

to
Charles
Holland
,
saying,--
 
<EOS>
"
there

however

I

Sir

Varney
retire
to
rest
that
night
--
his
promise
to
the
Bannerworths
fill
his
mind
with
many
reflection
--
the
insecurity
of
his
own
position
,
and
the
frail
tenure
which
he
even
hold
in
the
hand
of
those
whom
he
have
most
injure
.
 
<EOS>
this
produce
a
series
of
reflection
of
a
grave
and
melancholy
nature
,
and
he
sit
by
his
window
,
watch
the
progress
of
the
cloud
,
as
they
appear
to
chase
each
other
over
the
face
of
the
scene

now
cast
a
shade
over
the

then
banish
the
shadow

throw
a
gentle
light
over
the

surface

again
chase
away

how
long
he

sit
there
in
melancholy
musing

suddenly
he
be

Sir

listen
most
anxiously

some
sound
;
the
moon
fall
across
his
face

give
it
a
ghastly
hue

that

add
to
his
natural
paleness

give
him
an
almost
unearthly
aspect

grow
more

more
distant

the
shout

noise
of
man
traverse
the

subside

gradually
the
place
become
restore
to
its
original
silence

the
mob

after
have
search
every

not
find

this
most
desperate
peril
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
seem
to
have
more
effect
upon
him
than
anything
that
have
occur
during
his
most
strange
and
most
eventful
career
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
assure
that
the
riotous
mob
that
have
be
so
intent
upon
his
destruction
be
go
,
and
that
he
may
emerge
from
his
place
of
concealment
,
he
do
so
with
an
appearance
of
such
utter
exhaustion
that
the
Bannerworth
family
could
not
but
look
upon
him
as
a
being
who
be
near
his
end
.
 
<EOS>
at
any
time
his
countenance
,
as
we
long
have
have
occasion
to
remark
,
be
a
strange
and
unearthly
look
one
;
but
when
we
come
to
superadd
to
the
strangeness
of
his
ordinary
appearance
the
trace
of
deep
mental
emotion
,
we
may
well
say
that
Varney
's
appearance
be
positively
of
the
most
alarming
character
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
seat
in
the
ordinary
sit
apartment
of
the
Bannerworths
,
he
draw
a
long
sighing
breath
,
and
place
his
hand
upon
his
heart
,
he
say
,
in
a
faint
tone
of
voice,--
 
<EOS>
"
It
beat
now
laboriously
,
but
it
will
soon
cease
its
pulsation
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
these
word
sound
absolutely
prophetic
,
there
be
about
them
such
a
solemn
aspect
,
and
he
look
at
the
same
time
that
he
utter
them
so
much
like
one
whose
mortal
race
be
run
,
and
who
be
now
a
candidate
for
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
speak
so
despairingly
,

say
Charles
Holland
;
"
remember
,
that
if
your

one
of
error
hitherto

how
short
a
space

suffice
to
redeem
some
of
them

this

money

over

by
night

with

a
knowledge

can

that
Marmaduke

reach
home
safely

the
large
sum

which
he
have
become
possessed

that
he
have
hide
it
securely

which
be

an
ordinary
measure

precaution

that

frenzy
rise

<EOS>
I
soon
,
however
,
find
that
the
mob
who
come
to
see
such
a
spectacle
be
not
so
debased
as
I
imagine
,
but
that
it
be
at
the
hangman
,
who
have
suddenly
make
his
appearance
on
the
scaffold
,
at
whom
they
raise
that
fearful
yell
.
 
<EOS>
"
some
one
--
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
one
of
the
sheriff
--
<EOS>
must
have
notice
that
I
be
labour
under
the
impression
that
the
cry
from
the
mob
be
level
at
me
,
for
he
speak
,
saying,--
 
"
'
It
be
at
the
hangman
they
shout
,
'
and
he
indicate
with
his
finger
that
public
functionary
.
<EOS>
in
my
mind
's
eye
I
think
I
see
him
now
,
and
I
be
certain
that
I
shall
never
forget
the
expression
of
his
face
.
<EOS>
It
be
perfectly
fearful
;
and
afterwards
,
when
I
learn
who
and
what
he
be
,
I
be
not
surprised
that
he
should
feel
so
acutely
the
painfully
degrade
office
which
he
have
to
perform
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
fatal
rope
be
in
a
few
minute
adjust
to
my
neck
.
<EOS>
I
feel
its
pressure
,
and
I
hear
the
confused
sound
of
the
monotonous
voice
of
the
clergyman
,
as
he
mutter
some
prayer
,
that
I
must
confess
sound
to
me
at
the
time
like
a
mockery
of
human
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
suddenly
there
be
a
loud
shout
--
I
feel
the
platform
give
way
beneath
my
foot
--
I
try
to
utter
a
yell
of
agony
,
but
could
not
--
it
seem
to
me
as
if
I
be
encompass
by
fire
,

sensation
leave
me

I

no

the
next
feeling
of
existence
that
come
over
me
consist
in
a
frightful
tingling
sensation
throughout
my
vein

I
feel
myself
make
vain
effort
to
scream
.
<EOS>
all
the
sensation
of
a
person
suffer
from
a
severe
attack
of
nightmare
come
across
me

I
be
in
such
an
agony

I
inwardly

for
death

release
me
from
such
a
cruel
state

suddenly
the
power
to
utter

to
me

consciousness
again

I
find
myself
upon

a
man
present
some
stimulus
to
me
in

him

into

twenty

an
impression

be
some
time
before

it

only
in
a

I
listen
to
him
with
a
strange

then
he
tell
how
a
young

enthusiastic
medical
man
have
be
anxious
to
try
some
experiment
with

person
apparently
dead

He
relate
how
the
doctor
have
be
successful

how
he
be
so
terrified
at
his

leave
London

I
listen
to
this
with
the

he
conclude

by
say
to
me,--
 
"

ask
him
what
the
arrangement
be

he
say
that

I
would
solemnly
bind
myself
to
pay
to
him
a
certain
sum
per

he
would
keep
my
secret

do
something

should

with

pleasanter

keep
my

so

during

to
live
well

to
pay
to
the

sum
I

agree
upon

this
plan

course
it
be
neither
an
honest
nor
respectable
one

it
succeed

I
soon
find
myself
in
a
position
to
enable
me
thereby
to
keep
my
engagement

as
well

to
supply
me
with

plan
for
my
future
fortune

never

so
large
a
sum
of
money
be
somewhere
conceal
about
Bannerworth
Hall

I
still
look
forward
to
obtain
it
by

another

It
be
in
this
juncture
of
affair

that
one
night
I
be
ride
on
horseback
through
a
desolate
part
of
England

the
moon
be
shine
sweetly
,
as
I
come
to
a
broad
stream
of
water
,
across
which
,
about
a
mile
further
on
,
I
see
that
there
be
a
bridge
,

be
unwilling
to
waste
time
by
ride
up
to
it
,
and
fancy
,
by
the
lazy
ripple
of
the
water
,
that
the
river
be
not
shallow
,
I
plunge
my
horse
boldly
into
the
stream
.
 
<EOS>
"
when
we
reach
its
centre
,
some
sudden
indisposition
must
have
seize
the
horse

for
instead
of
swim
on
well
and
gallantly
as
it
have
do
before
,
it
pause
for
a
moment
,
and
then
plunge
headlong
into
the
torrent
.

I
could
not
swim
,

<EOS>
so
,
for
a
second
time

death

with
all
its
terror

possession

over

all
be
past

I
know
no

I
find
myself
lie
upon
a
bright
green
meadow

the
full
beam
of
the
moon
shine
upon
me

I
be
giddy

I

slowly
away

moment
gather
fresh
strength

from
that
time

this

I
never

how
I
come

from

water

lie
upon

green
bank

from
that
moment
the

about
with
an
impression

come
across
a
man

who
be
full
of
strange
story
of
vampyre

he
tell
me
that
a
vampyre
could
not

drown

for
that
the
water
would
cast
him
upon
its
bank

if
the
moonbeam
fall
upon
him

he
would
be
restore
to
life

preternatural

hunt
through

some
slight
allusion

conceal
the

I
have
resolve

at
first
to
try
pacific
measure

accordingly

as
you

well
aware

I
make
various
proposal
to
you
to
purchase

to
rent
Bannerworth
Hall

the
whole

you
reject

that
I

myself
compel

adopt
the
original

suggest
themselves
to
me

endeavour
to
terrify
you
from

house

prowl
about

myself
familiar

remark
Henry

I
can

<EOS>
the

be

everything

<EOS>
the

Marmaduke

be
not

I
have
every

without

become
the

Varney

me

<EOS>

the

if
you

twice
over

I
would
tell
you
so

It
be
a
very
sensible
idea

I
should
like
to
know
who

more

"
well

well

Henry

"
we
must
not
dispute

about

<EOS>
for

I
have
little

certainly

nothing

<EOS>
Varney
do
look
fearfully
exhausted

,
with
the

of
Henry

he
go
into

lay
down
upon

show
great
symptom
of
debility

want
of
power

<EOS>
and
now
it
be
a
calm
;
Varney
's
stay
at
the
cottage
of
the
Bannerworths
be
productive
of
a
different
mood
of
mind
than
ever
he
have
possess
before
.
<EOS>
He
look
upon
them
in
a
very
different
manner
to
what
he
have
be
use
to
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
moreover
,
considerably
alter
prospect
;
there
could
not
be
the
same
hope
and
expectation
that
he
once
have
.
<EOS>
He
be
an
altered
man
.
<EOS>
He
see
in
the
Bannerworths
those
who
have
save
his
life
,
and
who
,
without
doubt
,
have
possess
an
opinion
,
not
merely
obnoxious
to
him
,
but
must
have
have
some
fearful
misgiving
concern
his
character
,
and
that

too
,
of
a
nature
that
usually
shut
out
all
hope
of
be
receive
into
any
family

<EOS>
but
,
in
the
hour
of
his
need
,
when
his

be
in
danger
,
no
one
else
would
have
do
what
they
have
do
for
him

especially
when
so
relatively
place

<EOS>
moreover
,
he
have
be
conceal
,
when
to
do
so
be
both
dangerous

difficult

then
it
be
do
by
Flora

herself

<EOS>
Time
fly
by
.
<EOS>
the
mode
of
pass
time
at

cottage
be
calm

serene

<EOS>
Varney
have
seldom
witness
anything
like
it
;
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
he
feel
more
at
ease
than
ever
he
have
;
he
be
charm
with
the
society
of
Flora
--
in
fact
,
with
the
whole
of
the
little
knot
of
individual
who
there
collect
together
;
from
what
he
see
he
be
gratify
in
their
society
;
and
it
seem
to
alleviate
his
mental
disquiet
,
and
the
sense
he
must
feel
of
his
own
peculiar
position
.
<EOS>
but
Varney
become
ill
.
<EOS>
the
state
of
mind
and
body
he
have
be
in
for
some
time
past
may
be
the
cause
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
much
harass
,
and
hunt
from
place
to
place
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
moment
in
which
his
life
be
not
in
danger
,
and
he
have
,
moreover
,
more
than
one
case
,
receive
some
bodily
injury
,
bruise
,
and
contusion
of
a
desperate
character
;
and
yet
he
would
take
no
notice
of
them

allow
them
to
get
well
again
,
as
best
they
could

<EOS>
His
escape
and
injury
have
make
a
deep
impression
upon
his
mind
,
and
have
no
doubt
a
corresponding
effect
upon
his
body
,
and
Varney
become
very
ill
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
Bannerworth
do
all
that
could
be
do
for
one
in
his
painful
position
,
and
this
greatly
add
to
the
depth
of
thought
that
occasionally
beset
him
,
and
he
could
scarcely
draw
one
limb
after
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
He
walk
from
room
to
room
in
the
twilight
,
at
which
time
he
have
more
liberty
permit
him
than
at
any
other

because
there
be

danger
in
his
do
so
;
for
,
if
once
see
,
there
could
be
no
manner
of
doubt
but
he
would
have
be
pursue
until
he
be
destroy
,
when
no
other
mean
of
escape
be
at
hand
;
and
Varney
himself
feel
that
there
could
be
no
chance
of
his
again
escape
from
them
,
for
his
physical
power
be
fast
decaying
;
he
be
not
,
in

the

<EOS>
He
come
out
into

from
the

it

I
hope

be

None

go
out

quiet

We

to
look

than
we
can
see
under
such
circumstance

I
fear

be
some

familiar
feature
that
I
should
find
sad
havoc
in

You

certainly
,
for
the
burning

make
some
dismal
appearance

time
may
efface
that

then
the

die
away

the

<EOS>
the

there

<EOS>
as

let
fall

the

by

Francis

from

I

Varney

rise

saying,--

<EOS>
Varney
,
however
,
pay
no
attention
to
that

but
rush
past
,
throw
his
chair
down
to
impede
the
officer

who
could
not
stay
himself
,
but
fall
over
it
,
while
Varney
make
a
rush
towards
the
window

which
he
clear
at
one
bind

cross
the
road

rise
to

"
I
do
not

the

take
the

that
will
be
enough
.

"
 
<EOS>
"
in
heaven

"
say
Henry
,
"
explain
all

I
be
at

"
 
<EOS>
"
We
will
return
and
do
so
presently

"
say
the
officer
as
he
dash
out
of
the
house
after
the
fugitive
at
a
rapid
and
reckless
speed
,
follow
by
his
companion
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
who
have
be
leave
with
the
chaise
,
however
,
be
the
first
in
the
chase
;
see
an
escape
from
the
window
,
he
immediately
guess
that
he
be
the
man
want
,
and
,
but
for
an
accident
,
he
would
have
meet
Varney
at
the
gate
,
for
,
as
he
be
get
out
in
a
hurry
,
his
foot
become
entangle
with
the
rein
,
and
he
fall
to
the
ground
,
and
Varney
at
the
same
moment
step
over
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
curse
his
infernal
impudence
,
and
d
--
<EOS>
n
these
rein
!
<EOS>
"
mutter
the
man
in
a
fury
at
the
accident
,
and
the
aggravate
circumstance
of
the
fugitive
walk
over
him
in
such
a
manner
,
and
so
coolly
too
--
it
be
vex
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
,
however
,
quickly
release
himself
,
and
rush
after
Varney
across
the
road
,
and
keep
on
his
track
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
the
moon
be
still
rise
,
and
shed
but
a
gloomy
light
around
.
<EOS>
everything
be
almost
invisible
until
you
come
close
to
it
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
reason
why
Varney
and
his
pursuer
meet
with
several
severe
accident
--
fumble
and
hard
knock
against
impediment
which
the
light
and
the
rapid
flight
they
be
take
do
not
admit
of
their
avoid
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
They
go
on
for
some
time
,
but
it
be
evident
Varney
know
the
place
good
,
and
could
avoid
what
the
man
could
not
,
and
that
be
the
tree
and
the
natural
impediment
of
the
ground
,
which
Varney
be
acquaint
with
.
 
<EOS>
for
instance
,
at
full
speed
across
a
meadow
,
a
hollow
would
suddenly
present
itself
,
and
to
an
accustomed
eye
the
moonlight
may
enable
it
to
be
distinguish
at
a
glance
what
it
be
,
while
to
one
wholly
unaccustomed
to
it
,
the
hollow
would
often
look
like
a
hillock
by
such
a
light
.
<EOS>
this
Varney
would
clear
at
a
bind
,
which
a
less
agile
and
heavy
person
would
step
into
,
lift
up
his
leg
to
meet
an
impediment
,
when
he
would
find
it
come
down
suddenly
some
six
or
eight
inch
low
than
he
anticipate
,
almost
dislocate
his
leg
and
neck
,
and
produce
a
corresponding
loss
of
breath
,
which
be
not
regain
by
the
muttered
curse
upon
such
a
country
where
the
place
be
so
uneven
.
 
<EOS>
have
come
to
one
of
these
place
,
which
be
a
little
more
perceptible
than
the
other
,
he
make
a
desperate
jump
,
but
he
jump
into
the
middle
of
the
hole
with
such
force
that
he
sprain
his
ankle
,
besides
sink
into
a
small
pond
that
be
almost
dry
,
be
overgrow
with
rush
and
aquatic
plant
.
 
<EOS>
"
well

"
say
the
other
officer
come
up--"well

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well

come

I
tumble
down

out

I
come
out

Wilkinson

if
I

because

You

no

when
I
lead

it

this

a

again

<EOS>
You
must

amuse
yourself
at

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
I
,
"
reply
the

.
<EOS>
"
here
be
my

;
they
do

out
in

"
 
<EOS>
and
,
as
he
speak
,
he
produce
the
warrant
,
when
it
be
evident
the
officer
speak
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
be
this
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
You
see
that
this
Varney
be
a
regular
scamp
,
gamester
,
rogue
,
and
murderer
.
<EOS>
He
be
hang
,
and
hang
about
the
usual
time
;
he
be
cut
down
and
the
body
be
give
to
some
one
for
dissection
,
when
a
surgeon
,
with
the
hangman
,
one
Montgomery
,
succeed
in
restore
the
criminal
to
life
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
always
think
they
break
the
neck
when
they
be
hang
;
the
weight
of
the
body
would
alone
do
that
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
dear
,
no
,
sir
,
"
say
the
officer
;
"
that
be
one
of
the
common
every
day
mistake
;
they
do
not
break
the
neck
once
in
twenty
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
;
they
die
of
suffocation
only
;
this
man
,
Beauchamp
,
be
hang
thus
,
but
they
contrive
to
restore
him
,
and
then
he
assume
a
new
name
,
and
leave
London
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
how
come
you
to
know
all
this
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
<EOS>
it
come
to
us
,
as
many
thing
usually
do
,
in
a
very
extraordinary
manner
,
and
in
a
manner
that
appear
most
singular
and
out
of
the
way
;
but
such
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
executioner
who
be
the
mean
of
his
be
restore
,
or
one
of
them
,
wish
to
turn
him
to
account
,
and
use
to
draw
a
yearly
sum
of
money
from
him
,
as
hush
money
,
to
induce
them
to
keep
the
secret
;
else
,
the
fact
of
his
have
escape
punishment
would
subject
him
to
a
repetition
of
the
same
punishment
;
when
,
of
course
,
a
little
more
care
would
be
take
that
he
do
not
escape
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
not
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
you
see
,
Varney
,
or
rather
Beauchamp
,
be
to
pay
a
heavy
sum
to
this
man
to
keep
him
quiet
,
and
to
permit
him
to
enjoy
the
life
he
have
so
strangely
become
possess
of
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
,
"
say
Holland
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
this
man
,
Montgomery
,
have
always
some
kind
of
suspicion
that
Varney
would
murder
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
murder
him
!
<EOS>
and
be
the
mean
of
save
his
life
;
surely
he
could
not
be
so
bad
as
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
see
,
sir
,
this
hangman
draw
a
heavy
sum
yearly
from
him
;
thus
make
him
only
a
mine
of
wealth
to
himself
;
this
,
no
doubt
,
would
rankle
in
the
other
's
heart
,
to
think
he
should
be
so
beset
,
and
hold
life
upon
such
term
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
,
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
and
then
come
the
consideration
that
he
do
not
do
it
from
any
good
motive
,
merely
a
selfish
one
,
and
he
be
consequently
under
no
obligation
to
him
for
what
he
have
do
;
besides
,
self
-
preservation
may
urge
him
on
,
and
tell
him
to
do
the
deed
.
 
<EOS>
"
however
that
may
be
,
Montgomery
dread
it
,
and
be
resolve
to
punish
the
deed
if
he
could
not
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
He
,
therefore
,
leave
general
order
with
his
wife
,
whenever
he
go
on
a
journey
to
Varney
,
if
he
should
be
go
beyond
a
certain
time
,
she
be
to
open
a
certain
drawer
,
and
take
out
a
seal
packet
to
the
magistrate
at
the
chief
office
,
who
would
attend
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
have
be
miss
,
and
his
wife
do
as
she
be
desire
,
and
now
we
have
find
what
he
there
mention
to
be
true
;
but
,
now
,
sir
,
I
have
satisfy
you
and
explain
to
you
why
we
intrude
upon
you
<EOS>
,
we
must
now
leave
and
seek
for
him
elsewhere
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
most
extraordinary
,
and
that
be
the
reason
why
his
complexion
be
so
singular
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
likely
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
pour
out
some
wine
,
which
be
hand
to
the
officer
,
who
drink
and
then
quit
the
house
,
leave
the
inmate
in
a
state
of
stupefaction
,
from
surprise
and
amazement
at
what
they
have
hear
from
the
officer
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
strange
feeling
come
over
them
when
they
recollect
the
many
occurrence
they
have
witness
,
and
even
the
explanation
of
the
officer
;
it
seem
as
if
some
mist
have
envelop
object
and
render
them
indistinct
,
but
which
be
fast
rise
,
and
they
be
become
plainer
and
more
distinct
every
moment
in
which
they
be
regard
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
long
pause
,
and
Flora
be
about
to
speak
,
when
suddenly
there
come
the
sound
of
a
footstep
across
the
garden
.
<EOS>
It
be
slow
but
unsteady
,
and
pause
between
while
until
it
come
close
beneath
the
window
.
<EOS>
They
remain
silent
,
and
then
some
one
be
hear
to
climb
up
the
rail
of
the
veranda
,
and
then
the
curtain
be
thrust
aside
,
but
not
till
after
the
person
outside
have
pause
to
ascertain
who
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
curtain
be
open
,
and
the
visage
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
appear
,
much
alter
;
in
fact
,
completely
wear
and
exhausted
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
useless
to
deny
it
,
but
he
look
ghastly
--
terrific
;
his
singular
visage
be
as
pallid
as
death
;
his
eye
almost
protrude
,
his
mouth
open
,
and
his
breathing
short
,
and
labour
in
the
extreme
.
 
<EOS>
He
climb
over
with
much
difficulty
,
and
stagger
into
the
room
,
and
would
have
speak
,
but
he
could
not
;
befell
senseless
upon
the
floor
,
utterly
exhausted
and
motionless
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
long
pause
,
and
each
one
present
look
at
each
other
,
and
then
they
gaze
upon
the
inanimate
body
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
which
lie
supine
and
senseless
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
*
 
<EOS>
the
importance
of
the
document
,
say
to
be
on
the
dead
body
,
be
such
that
it
would
admit
of
no
delay
before
it
be
obtain
,
and
the
party
determine
that
it
should
be
commence
instanter
.
<EOS>
lose
time
would
be
an
object
to
them
;
too
much
haste
could
hardly
be
make
;
and
now
come
the
question
of
,
"
should
it
be
to
-
night
,
or
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
"
say
Henry
Bannerworth
;
"
the
sooner
we
can
get
it
,
the
sooner
all
doubt
and
distress
will
be
at
an
end
;
and
,
consider
the
turn
of
event
,
that
will
be
desirable
for
all
our
sake
;
besides
,
we
know
not
what
unlucky
accident
may
happen
to
deprive
us
of
what
be
so
necessary
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
can
be
none
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
;
"
but
there
be
this
to
be
say
<EOS>
,
this
have
be
such
an
eventful
history
,
that
I
can
not
say
what
may
or
what
may
not
happen
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
may
as
well
go
this
very
night
,
"
say
Charles
Holland
.
<EOS>
"
I
give
my
vote
for
an
immediate
exhumation
of
the
body
.
<EOS>
the
night
be
somewhat
stormy
,
but
nothing
more
;
the
moon
be
up
,
and
there
will
be
plenty
of
light
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
rain
,
"
say
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
little
or
none
,
"
say
Charles
Holland
.
<EOS>
"
a
few
gust
of
wind
now
and
then
drive
a
few
heavy
plash
of
rain
against
the
window
,
and
that
give
a
fearful
sound
,
which
be
,
in
fret
,
nothing
,
when
you
have
to
encounter
it
;
but
you
will
go
,
doctor
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
most
certainly
.
<EOS>
We
must
have
some
tool
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
those
may
be
have
from
the
garden
,
"

Henry
.
<EOS>
"
tool
for
the
exhumation
,
you
mean
?
"
 
"
yes
;
pickaxe
,
mattock
,
and
a
crowbar
;
a
lantern
,
and
so
forth
,
"
say
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
I
be
at
home
in
this
;
the
fact
be
,
I
have
have
more
than
one
affair
of
this
kind
on
my
hand
before
now

whilst
a
student
I
have
have
more
than
one
adventure

strange
character

<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
,
doctor
,
"
say
Charles
Holland
,
<EOS>
"
you
have
some
sad
prank
to
answer
for
;
you
do
not
think
of
it
then
,
only
when
you
find
them
accumulate
in
a
heap
,
so
that
you
shall
not
be
able
to
escape
them
;
because
they
come
over
your
sense

you
sleep
at
night

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
Chillingworth
;
"
you
be
mistake
in
that
.
<EOS>
I
have
long
since
settle
all
my
account
of
that
nature
;
besides
,
I
never
take
a
dead
body
out
of
a
grave

in
the
name
of
science

never

anything
by
it

that
be
not
the
fact

you
know

you

your

"
yes

yes

I
do

how
much
more
do
the
public
not

the
doctor

with
a
smile

<EOS>
"
ah
,
well
,
we
will
not
argue
the
question
,
"
say
Charles

"
only
it
strike
me
that
the
doctor
could
never

"
 
<EOS>
"
there
may
be
a
little
truth
in

Chillingworth
;

now
we
have
better
quit
the

make
the
good
of

to
the
spot

the
unfortunate
man
lie
bury
in

come
with
me
into

Henry
Bannerworth

there

a

enough
to

yes

they
be
not
light
;

the
distance
be
by
far
too
great

easy
;
the
wind
blow
strong

to

come
up
afresh

,
by
the
time

we

Can
we
have
a
conveyance
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
the
doctor
;
<EOS>
"
we
could

but
we
must
trouble
the
turnpike
man

besides
,
there
be
a
short
way
across
some
field

will
be
well

the
horse

cart
would
have
settle

all
better

besides
carry
the
tool

"
 
<EOS>
"
very
true

very
true

the

all
that
be
not
without
its

you
shall
choose
which
way
you
would
have
it
do

I
be
persuade

for
two
reason

what
be
they
?

<EOS>

the
first
be
,
we
can
not
obtain
a
horse

cart
without
give
some
detail
as
to
what
you
want
it
for
,
which
be
awkward
,
on
account
of
the
hour
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
you
could
not
get
one
at
this
moment
in
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
ought
to
settle
the
argument
,
"
say
Henry
Bannerworth
;
"
an
impossibility
,
under
the
circumstance
,
<EOS>
at
once
be
a
clincher
,
and
one
that
may
be
allow
to
have
some
weight
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
say
that
,
"
say
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
"
besides
which
,
you
must
go
a
great
distance
,
and
that
,
too
,
along
the
main
road
,
which
be
objectionable
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
we
be
agree
,
"
say
Charles
Holland
,
"
and
the
sooner
we
be
off
the
well

the
night
grow
more
and
more
gloomy
every
hour

more
inclement

the
well

what
we

we
may

well
do
now

"
 
<EOS>
"
come
with
me
to
the
garden
,
"
say
Henry
,
"

we
will
take
the
tool

We
can
go
out
the

way

will

<EOS>
They
all
now
leave
the
apartment
,
wrap
up
in
great
overcoat
,
to
secure
themselves
against
the
weather
,
and
also
for
the
purpose
of
conceal
themselves
from
any
chance
passenger
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
garden
they
find
the
tool
they
require
,
and
have
choose
them
,
they
take
a
lantern
,
with
the
mean
of
get
a
light
when
they
get
to
their
journey
's
end
,
which
they
would
do
in
less
than
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
after
have
duly
inspect
the
state
of
their
efficiency
,
they
start
away
on
their
expedition

<EOS>
the
night
have
turn
gloomy

windy
;
heavy
driving
masse
of
cloud
obscure
the

only
now
and
then
be
to
be
see
,
when
the
cloud
permit
her
to
peep
out
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
there
be
many
drift
shower
,
which
last
but
a
few
minute
,
and
then
the
cloud
be
carry
forwards
by
some
sudden
gust
of
wind
so
that
,
altogether
,
it
be
a
most
uncomfortable
night
as
well
could
be
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
there
be
no
time
to
lose
,
and
,
under
all
circumstance
,
they
could
not
have
choose
a
well
night
for
their
purpose
than
the
one
they
have
;
indeed
,
they
could
not
desire
another
night
to
be
out
on
such
a
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
They
speak
not
while
they
be
within
sight
of
the
house
,
though
at
the
distance
of
many
yard
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
there
be
a
noise
through
the
tree
that
would
have
carry
their
voice
past
every
object
,
however
close
;
but
they
would
make
assurance
doubly
sure
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
we
be
fairly
away
now
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
from
all
fear
of
be
recognize
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
you
be
.
<EOS>
who
would
recognize
us
now
,
if
we
be
meet
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
one
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
not
;
and
,
moreover
,
there
would
be
but
small
chance
of
any
evil
come
from
it
,
even
if
it
be
to
happen
that
we
be
to
be
see
and
know
.
<EOS>
nobody
know
what
we
be
go
to
do
,
and
,
if
they
do
,
there
be
no
illegality
in
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
not
;
but
we
wish
the
matter
to
be
quite
secret
,
therefore
,
we
do
not
wish
to
be
see
by
any
one
while
upon
this
adventure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
exactly
,
"
say
Chillingworth
;
"
and
,
if
you
will
follow
my
guidance
,
you
shall
meet
nobody
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
will
trust
you
,
most
worthy
doctor
.
<EOS>
what
have
you
to
say
for
our
confidence
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
you
will
find
it
be
not
misplace
.
"
 
just
as
the
doctor
have
utter
the
last
sound
,
there
come
a
hearty
laugh
upon
the
air
,
which
,
indeed
,
sound
but
a
few
pace
in
advance
of
them
.
<EOS>
the
wind
blow
towards
them
,
and
would
,
therefore
,
cause
the
sound
to
come
to
them
,
but
not
to
go
away
in
the
direction
they
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
party
come
to
a
sudden
stand
still
;
there
be
something
so
strange
in
hear
a
laugh
at
that
moment
,
especially
as
Chillingworth
be
,
at
that
moment
,
boasting
of
his
knowledge
of
the
ground
and
the
certainty
of
their
meeting
no
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
some
one
laughing
,
I
think
,
"
say
Chillingworth
.
 
<EOS>
"
of
that
there
can
be
little
or
no
doubt
,
"
say
Charles
Holland
;
"
and
,
as
people
do
not
usually
laugh
by
themselves
<EOS>
so
heartily
,
it
may
be
presume
there
be
,
at
least
,
two
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
doubt
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
,
moreover
,
their
purpose
can
not
be
a
very
good
one
,
at
this
hour
of
the
night
,
and
of
such
a
night
,
too
.
<EOS>
I
think
we
have
better
be
cautious
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
<EOS>
follow
me
silently
,
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
speak
,
he
move
cautiously
from
the
spot
where
he
stand
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
he
be
follow
by
the
whole
party
,
until
they
come
to
the
hedge
which
skirt
a
lane
,
in
which
be
seat
three
man
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
a
sort
of
tent
erect
,
and
that
be
hang
upon
a
part
of
the
hedge
which
be
to
windward
of
them
,
so
that
it
shelter
them
from
wind
and
rain
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
and
Chillingworth
both
peep
over
the
bank
,
and
see
them
seat
beneath
this
kind
of
canopy
.
<EOS>
They
be
shabby
,
gipsy
-
look
man
,
who
may
be
something
else
--
sheep
-
stealer
,
or
horse
-
stealer
,
in
fact
,
anything
,
even
to
beggar
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Jack
,
"
say
one
;
"
it
be
no
bottle
to

night

"
 
<EOS>
"
no
;
there
be
nobody
about
these
part

night

<EOS>
We
be
safe
,

so
be
they
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
exactly
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
besides
,
you
see
,
those
who
do
happen
to

out
be
not
worth
talk
to

"
 
<EOS>
"
no
cash
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

none

not
enough
to
pay
turnpike
for
a
walking

slick
,
at
the
most
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
besides
,
it
do
us
no
good
to
take
a
few
shilling
from
a
poor
wretch
,
who
have
more
in
family
than
he
have
shilling
in
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
you
be
right
,
quite
right
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
it
myself
,
I
do
not
;
besides
that
,
there
be
fresh
risk
in
every
man
you
stop
,
and
these
poor
fellow
will
fight
hard
for
a
few
shilling
,
and
there
be
no
know
what
an
unlucky
blow
may
do
for
a
man
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
very
true
.
<EOS>
have
anything
be
do
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
nothing
,
"
say
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
only
three
half
crown
,
"
say
the
other
;
"
that
be
the
extent
of
the
common
purse
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
I
,
"
say
the
third
,
"
I
have
get
a
bottle
of
bad
gin
from
the
Cat
and
Cabbage
-
stump
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
manage
it
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
this
way
.
<EOS>
I
go
in
,
and
have
some
beer
,
and
you
know
I
can
give
a
long
yarn
when
I
want
;
but
it
want
only
a
little
care
to
deceive
these
know
countryman
,
so
I
talk
and
talk
,
until
they
get
quite
chatty
,
and
then
I
put
the
gin
in
my
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
good
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
the
loaf
and
beef
I
take
out
of
the
safe
as
I
come
by
,
and
I
dare
say
they
know
they
have
lose
it
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
and
so
do
we
.
<EOS>
I
expect
the
gin
will
help
to
digest
the
beef
,
so
we
must
not
complain
of
the
good
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
;
give
us
another
glass
,
Jim
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jim
hold
the
glass
towards
him
,
when
the
doctor
,
animate
by
the
spirit
of
mischief
,
take
a
good
sized
pebble
,
and
throw
it
into
the
glass
,
smash
it
,
and
spill
the
content
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
moment
there
be
a
change
of
scene
;
the
man
be
all
terrified
,
and
start
to
their
foot
,
while
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
cause
their
light
to
go
out
;
at
the
same
time
their
tent
-
cloth
be
throw
down
by
the
wind
,
and
fall
across
their
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
along
,
"
say
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
need
of
say
so
,
for
in
a
moment
the
three
be
as
if
animate
by
one
spirit
,
and
away
they
scud
across
the
field
,
with
the
speed
of
a
race
horse
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
they
be
well
than
half
a
mile
away
from
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
"
in
absence
of
all
authentic
information
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
speak
as
well
as
he
could
,
and
blow
prodigiously
between
each
word
,
as
though
he
be
fetch
breath
all
the
way
from
his
heel
,
"
I
think
we
may
conclude
we
be
safe
from
them
.
<EOS>
We
ought
to
thank
our
star
we
come
across
them
in
the
way
we
do
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
doctor
,
what
in
the
name
of
Heaven
induce
you
to
make
such
a
noise
,
to
frighten
them
,
in
fact
,
and
to
tell
them
some
one
be
about
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
be
too
much
terrified
to
tell
whether
it
be
one
,
or
fifty
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
they
be
out
of
the
county
;
they
know
what
they
be
talk
about
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
perhaps
we
may
meet
them
on
the
road
where
we
be
go
,
think
it
a
rare
lonely
spot
where
they
can
hide
,
and
no
chance
of
their
being
find
out
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
[

"
<EOS>
no
,
"
say
the
doctor
;
"
they
will
not
go
to
such
a
place
;
it
have
by
far
too
bad
a
name
for
even
such
man
as
those
to
go
near
,
much
less
stop
in
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
hardly
think
that
,
"
say
Charles
Holland
,
"
for
these
fellow
be
too
terrified
for
their
personal
safety
,
to
think
of
the
superstitious
fear
with
which
a
place
may
be
regard
;
and
these
man
,
in
such
a
place
as
the
one
you
speak
of
,
they
will
be
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
rather
than
be
do
,
we
must
fight
for
it
;
and
when
you
come
to
consider
we
have
one
pick
and
two
shovel
,
we
shall
be
in
full
force
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
say
,
doctor
;
how
far
have
we
to
go
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
pursue
their
way
through
the
field
,
and
under
the
hedge
-
row
,
until
they
come
to
a
gate
,
where
they
stop
awhile
,
and
begin
to
consult
and
to
listen
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
few
yard
up
here
,
on
the
left
,
"
say
the
doctor
;
"
I
know
the
spot
;
besides
,
there
be
a
particular
mark
.
<EOS>
now
,
then
,
be
you
all
ready
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
here
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
point
out
the
mark
by
which
the
spot
may
be
recognize
;
"
here
be
the
spot
,
and
I
think
we
shall
not
be
half
a
foot
out
of
our
reckoning
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
let
us
begin
instanter
,
"
say
Henry
,
as
he
seize
hold
of
the
pickaxe
,
and
begin
to
loosen
the
earth
by
mean
of
the
sharp
end
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
will
do
for
the
present
,
"
say
Chillingworth
;
"
now
let
me
and
Charles
take
a
turn
with
our
shovel
,
and
you
will
get
on
again
presently
.
<EOS>
throw
the
earth
up
on
the
bank
in
one
heap
,
so
that
we
can
put
it
on
again
without
attract
any
attention
to
the
spot
by
its
be
leave
in
clod
and
uneven
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
exactly
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
else
the
body
will
be
discover
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
begin
to
shovel
away
,
and
continue
to
do
so
,
after
it
have
be
pick
up
,
work
alternately
,
until
at
length
Charles
stick
his
pick
-
axe
into
something
soft
,
and
upon
pull
it
up
,
he
find
it
be
the
body
.
 
<EOS>
a
dreadful
odour
now
arise
from
the
spot
,
and
they
be
at
no
loss
to
tell
where
the
body
lie
.
<EOS>
the
pick
-
axe
have
stick
into
the
deceased
's
ribs
and
clothing
,
and
thus
lift
it
out
of
its
place
.
 
<EOS>
"
here
it
be
,
"
say
the
doctor
;
"
but
I
need
not
tell
you
that
;
the
charnel
-
house
smell
be
enough
to
convince
you
of
the
fact
of
where
it
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
;
just
show
a
light
upon
the
subject
,
doctor
,
and
then
we
can
see
what
we
be
about
--
<EOS>
do
you
mind
,
<EOS>
doctor
<EOS>
--
you
have
the
management
of
the
lantern
,
you
know
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
"
say
Chillingworth
;
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
have
it
--
don't
be
in
a
hurry
,
but
do
thing
deliberately
and
coolly
<EOS>
whatever
you
do
--
you
will
not
be
so
liable
to
make
mistake
,
or
to
leave
anything
undone
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
will
be
nothing
of
any
use
to
you
here
,
doctor
,
in
the
way
of
dissection
,
for
the
flesh
<EOS>
be
one
mass
of
decay
.
<EOS>
what
a
horrible
sight
,
to
be
sure
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
;
but
hasten
the
search
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
must
;
though
,
to
confess
the
truth
,
I
would
sooner
handle
anything
than
this
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
the
most
pleasant
thing
in
the
world
,
for
there
be
no
knowing
what
may
be
the
result
--
what
creep
thing
have
make
a
home
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
do
not
mention
anything
about
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Henry
and
Charles
Holland
now
begin
to
search
the
pocket
of
the
clothe
of
the
dead
body
,
in
one
of
which
be
something
hard
,
that
feel
like
a
parcel
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
have
you
get
there
?
"
<EOS>
say
Chillingworth
,
as
he
hold
his
lantern
up
so
that
the
light
fall
upon
the
ghastly
object
that
they
be
handle
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
the
prize
,
"
say
Charles
Holland
;
"
but
we
have
not
get
it
out
yet
,
though
I
dare
say
it
will
not
be
long
first
,
if
this
wind
will
but
hold
good
for
about
five
minute
,
and
keep
the
stench
down
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
now
tear
open
the
packet
and
pull
out
the
paper
,
which
appear
to
have
be
secrete
upon
his
person
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
sure
there
be
none
on
any
other
part
of
the
body
,
"
say
Chillingworth
,
"
because
what
you
do
now
,
you
have
better
do
well
,
and
leave
nothing
to
after
thought
,
because
it
be
frequently
impracticable
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
advice
be
good
,
"
say
Henry
,
who
make
a
second
search
,
but
find
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
well
re

bury
him
,

the
doctor
;
"
it
have
better
be
do
cleanly
.
<EOS>
well
,
it
be
a
sad
hole
for
a
last
resting
-
place
,
and
yet
I
do
not
know
that
it
matter
<EOS>
--
it
be
all
a
matter
of
taste
--
the
fashion
of
the
class
,
or
the
particular
custom
of
the
country
.
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
but
little
to
be
say
against
such
an
argument
,
though
the
custom
of
the
age
have
cause
them
to
look
upon
it
more
as
a
matter
of
feeling
than
in
such
a
philosophical
sense
as
that
in
which
the
doctor
have
put
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
there
he
be
now
--
shovel
the
earth
in
,
Charles
,
"
say
Henry
Bannerworth
,
as
he
himself
set
the
example
,
which
be
speedily
and
vigorously
follow
by
Charles
Holland
,
when
they
be
not
long
before
the
earth
be
throw
in
and
cover
up
with
care
,
and
tread
down
so
that
it
should
not
appear
to
be
move
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
will
do
,
I
think
,
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
it
be
not
quite
the
same
,
but
I
dare
say
no
one
will
try
to
make
any
discovery
in
this
place
;
besides
,
if
the
rain
continue
to
come
down
very
heavy
,
why
,
it
will
wash
much
of
it
away
,
and
it
will
make
it
look
all
alike
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
little
inducement
to
hover
about
the
spot
,
but
Henry
could
not
forbear
hold
up
the
paper
to
the
light
of
the
lantern
to
ascertain
what
they
be
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
they
all
right
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
reply
Henry
,
"
yes
.
<EOS>
the
Dearbrook
estate
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
;
they
be
the
paper
I
be
in
want
of
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
singularly
fortunate
,
at
least
,
to
be
successful
in
secure
them
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
glad
a
live
person
have
possession
of
them
,
else
it
would
have
be
very
difficult
to
have
obtain
it
from
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
it
would
;
but
now
homeward
be
the
word
,
doctor
;
and
on
my
word
there
be
reason
to
be
glad
,
<EOS>
for
the
rain
be
come
on
very
fast
now
,
and
there
be
no
moon
at
all
--
we
have
well
step
out
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
do
,
for
the
three
walk
as
fast
as
the
nature
of
the
soil
would
permit
them
,
and
the
darkness
of

CHAPTER
LXXXIX
.
 
<EOS>
tells
<EOS>
what
became
of
the
second
VAMPYRE
who
seek
VARNEY
.
  
<EOS>
[
illustration
]
 
<EOS>
We
leave
the
hungarian
nobleman
swim
down
the
stream
;
he
swam
slowly
,
and
use
but
little
exertion
in
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
appear
to
use
his
hand
only
as
a
means
of
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
the
stream
carry
him
onwards
,
and
he
aid
himself
so
far
that
he
keep
the
middle
of
the
stream
,
and
float
along
.
 
<EOS>
where
the
stream
be
broad
and
shallow
,
it
sometimes
leave
him
a
moment
or
two
,
without
be
strong
enough
to
carry
him
onwards
;
then
he
would
pause
,
as
if
gain
strength
,
and
finally
he
would
,
when
he
have
rest
,
and
the
water
come
a
little
faster
,
and
lift
him
,
make
a
desperate
plunge
,
and
swim
forward
,
until
he
again
come
in
deep
water
,
and
then
he
go
slowly
along
with
the
stream
,
as
he
support
himself
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
strange
thus
to
see
a
man
go
down
slowly
,
and
without
any
effort
whatever
,
pass
through
shade
and
through
moonlight
--
now
lose
in
the
shadow
of
the
tall
tree
,
and
now
emerge
into
that
part
of
the
stream
which
run
through
meadow
and
cornfield
,
until
the
stream
widen
,
and
then
,
at
length
,
a
ferry
-
house
be
to
be
see
in
the
distance
.
 
<EOS>
then
come
the
ferryman
out
of
his
hut
,
to
look
upon
the
beautiful
moonlight
scene
.
<EOS>
It
be
cold
,
but
pure
,
and
brilliantly
light
.
<EOS>
the
chaste
moon
be
sail
through
the
heavens
,
and
the
star
diminish
in
their
lustre
by
the
power
of
the
luminous
goddess
of
night
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
small
cottage
--
true
,
it
be
somewhat
large
than
be
generally
suppose
by
any
casual
observer
who
may
look
at
it
.
<EOS>
the
place
be
ramble
,
and
build
chiefly
of
wood
;
but
in
it
live
the
ferryman
,
his
wife
,
and
family
;
among
these
be
a
young
girl
about
seventeen
year
of
age
,
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
very
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
be
prepare
their
supper
,
and
the
ferryman
himself
walk
out
to
look
at
the
river
and
the
shadow
of
the
tall
tree
that
stand
on
the
hill
opposite
.
 
<EOS>
while
thus
employ
,
he
hear
a
plashing
in
the
water
,
and
on
turn
towards
the
quarter
whence
the
sound
proceed
for
a
few
yard
,
he
come
to
the
spot
where
he
see
the
stranger
struggle
in
the
stream
.
 
<EOS>
"
good
God
!
"
<EOS>
he
mutter
to
himself
,
as
he
see
the
struggle
continue
;
"
good
God
!
<EOS>
he
will
sink
and
drown
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
he
speak
,
he
jump
into
his
boat
and
push
it
off
,
for
the
purpose
of
stop
the
descent
of
the
body
down
the
stream
,
and
in
a
moment
or
two
it
come
near
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
muttered,--
 
<EOS>
"
come
,
come
--
he
try
to
swim
;
life
be
not
go
yet
--
he
will
do
now
,
if
I
can
catch
hold
of
him
.
<EOS>
swim
with
one
's
face
under
the
stream
do
not
say
much
for
his
skill
,
though
it
may
account
for
the
fact
that
he
do
not
cry
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
the
drown
man
near
,
the
ferryman
hold
on
by
the
boat
-
hook
,
and
stoop
down
,
he
seize
the
drown
man
by
the
hair
of
the
head
,
and
then
pause
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
time
,
he
lift
him
up
,
and
place
him
across
the
edge
of
the
boat
,
and
then
,
with
some
struggling
of
his
own
,
he
be
roll
over
into
the
boat
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
safe
now
,
"
mutter
the
ferryman
.
 
<EOS>
the
stranger
speak
not
,
but
sit
or
lean
against
the
boat
's
head
,
sob
and
catch
at
his
breath
,
and
spit
off
his
stomach
the
water
it
may
be
presume
he
have
swallow
.
 
<EOS>
the
ferryman
put
back
to
the
shore
,
when
he
pause
,
and
secure
his
boat
,
and
then
pull
the
stranger
out
,
saying,--
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
feel
any
well
now
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
the
stranger
;
<EOS>
"
I
feel
I
be
live
--
<EOS>
thank
to
you
,
my
good
friend
<EOS>
;
I
owe
you
my
life
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
welcome
to
that
,
"
reply
the
ferryman
;
"
it
cost
me
nothing
;
and
,
as
for
my
little
trouble
,
I
should
be
sorry
to
think
of
that
,
when
a
fellow
-
being
's
life
be
in
danger
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
behave
very
well
--
very
well
,
and
I
can
do
little
more
now
than
thank
you
,
for
I
have
be
rob
of
all
I
possess
about
me
at
the
moment
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
you
have
be
rob
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
aye
,
truly
,
I
have
,
and
have
be
throw
into
the
water
,
and
thus
I
have
be
nearly
murder
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
lucky
you
escape
from
them
without
further
injury
,
"
say
the
ferryman
;
"
but
come
in
door
,
you
must
be
mad
to
stand
here
in
the
cold
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
thank
you
;
your
hospitality
be
great
,
and
,
at
this
moment
,
of
the
great
importance
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
such
as
we
have
,
"
say
the
honest
ferryman
,
"
you
shall
be
welcome
to
.
<EOS>
come
in
--
come
in
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
turn
round
and
lead
the
way
to
the
house
,
which
he
enter
,
say
--
as
he
open
the
small
door
that
lead
into
the
main
apartment
,
where
all
the
family
be
assemble
,
wait
for
the
almost
only
meal
they
have
have
that
day
,
for
the
ferryman
have
not
the
mean
,
before
the
sun
have
set
,
of
send
for
food
,
and
then
it
be
a
long
way
before
it
could
be
find
,
and
then
it
be
late
before
they
could
get
it,--
 
<EOS>
"
Wife
,
we
have
a
stranger
to
sleep
with
us
to
-
night
,
and
for
whom
we
must
prepare
a
bed
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
stranger
!
<EOS>
"
echo
the
wife--"a
stranger
,
and
we
so
poor
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
one
whose
life
I
have
save
,
and
who
be
nearly
drown
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
refuse
hospitality
upon
such
an
occasion
as
that
,
you
know
,
wife
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
wife
look
at
the
stranger
as
he
enter
the
room
,
and
sit
down
by
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
,
"
he
say
,
"
to
intrude
upon
you
;
but
I
will
make
you
amend
for
the
interruption
and
inconvenience
<EOS>
I
may
cause
you
;
but
it
be
too
late
to
apply
elsewhere
,
and
yet
I
be
doubtful
,
if
there
be
,
whether
I
could
go
any
further
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
the
ferryman
;
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
a
man
who
have
be
beat
and
rob
,
and
throw
into
a
rapid
and
,
in
some
part
,
deep
stream
,
be
not
fit

travel
at
this
time
of
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
lonely
about
here
,
"
say
the
stranger
,
as
he
shiver
by
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
rather
;
but
we
be
use
to
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
family
,
too
;
that
must
help
to
lighten
the
hour
away
,
and
help
you
over
the
long
evening
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
you
may
think
,
strange
,
and
,
at
time
,
so
it
be
;
but
when
food
run
short
,
it
be
a
long
while
to
daylight
,
before
any
more
money
can
be
have
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
we
have
fish
in
the
river
,
and
we
have
what
we
can
grow
in
the
garden
;
but
these
be
not
all
the
want
that
we
feel
,
and
those
other
be
sometimes
pinch
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
be
thankful
for
what
we
have
,
and
complain
but
little
when
we
can
get
no
more
;
but
sometimes
we
do
repine
--
though
I
can
not
say
we
ought
--
but
I
be
merely
relate
the
fact
,
whether
it
be
right
or
wrong

"
 
<EOS>
"
exactly
.
<EOS>
how
old
be
your
daughter
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
seventeen
come
Allhallow
's
eve

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
not
far
hence
,
"
say
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
may
be
in
this
part
of
the
country
--
and
I
think
I
shall
--
I
will
on
that
eve
pay
you
a
visit
;
not
one
on
which
I
shall
be
a
burden
to
you
,
but
one
more
useful
to
you
,
and
more
consonant
to
my
character

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
future
will
tell
us
all
about
that
,
"
say
the
ferryman
;
"
at
present
we
will
see
what
we
can
do
,
without
complain
,
or
tax
anybody
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
stranger
and
the
ferryman
sit
converse
for
some
time
before
the
fire
,
and
then
the
latter
point
out
to
him
which
be
his
bed
--
one
make
up
near
the
fire
,
for
the
sake
of
its
warmth
;
and
then
the
ferryman
retire
to
the
next
room
,
a
place
which
be
merely
divide
by
an
imperfect
partition
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
they
all
fall
soundly
asleep
.
<EOS>
the
hour
on
that
day
have
be
long
than
usual
;
there
be
not
that
buoyancy
of
spirit
;
when
they
retire
,
they
fall
off
into
a
heavy
,
deep
slumber
.
 
<EOS>
from
this
they
be
suddenly
arouse
by
loud
cry
and
pierce
scream
from
one
of
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
so
loud
and
shrill
be
the
cry
,
that
they
all
start
up
,
terrify
and
bewilder
beyond
measure
,
unable
to
apply
their
faculty
to
any
one
object
.
 
<EOS>
"
help

help

shriek
the
voice
of
the
young
girl

we
have
before
notice

the
ferryman
jump
up
,

rush
to
the
spot
where
his
daughter
lie

fast
asleep

when
I

I

something
at
my

very
sound
asleep

I

presently
I

into
the
flesh
of
my
neck
--
I
awoke
,
and
find
the
vampyre
at
his
repast
.
<EOS>
oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
stay
,
my
child
,
let
us
examine
the
wound
,
"
say
the
fisherman
,
and
he
hold
the
candle
to
the
spot
where
the
vampyre
's
tooth
have
be
apply
.
<EOS>
there
,
sure
enough
,
be
<EOS>
tooth
mark
,
such
as
a
human
being
's
would
make
be
they
apply
,
but
no
blood
have
be
draw
therefrom
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
,
come
,
Fanny
;
so
far
,
by
divine
Providence
,
you
be
not
injure
;
another
moment
,
and
the
mischief
would
have
be
do
entire
and
complete
,
and
you
would
have
be
his
victim
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
turn
to
the
stranger
,
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
have
some
hand
in
this
.
<EOS>
no
human
being
<EOS>
but
you
could
come
into
this
place
.
<EOS>
the
cottage
door
be
secure
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
the
vampyre
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
who
else
could
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I!--As
Heaven
's
my
judge
--
<EOS>
but
there
,
it
be
useless
to
speak
of
it
;
I
have
not
be
out
of
my
bed
.
<EOS>
in
this
place
,
dark
as
it
be
,
and
less
used
to
darkness
than
you
,
I
could
not
even
find
my
way
about.--it
be
impossible
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
get
out
of
your
bed
,
and
let
me
feel
,
"
say
the
ferryman
,
peremptorily--"get
out
,
and
I
will
soon
tell
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
stranger
arise
,
and
begin
to
dress
himself
,
and
the
ferryman
immediately
feel
the
bed
on
which
he
have
be
lie
;
but
it
be
ice
cold
--
so
cold
that
he
start
upon
his
leg
in
an
instant
,
exclaim
with
vehemence,--
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
you
,
vile
wretch
!
<EOS>
that
have
attempt
to
steal
into
the
cottage
of
the
poor
man
,
and
then
to
rob
him
of
his
only
child

that
child
of
her
heart
's
blood
,
base
ingrate
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
friend
,
you
be
wrong
,
entirely
wrong

<EOS>
I
be
not
the
creature
you
believe
me

<EOS>
I
have
sleep
,
and
sleep
soundly

awake
not

one
life
to
lose

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
as
he
speak
,
the
ferryman
make
a
desperate
rush
at
the
vampyre
,
and
seize
him
by
the
throat
,
and
a
violent
struggle
ensue
,
in
which
the
superior
strength
of
the
ferryman
prevail
,
and
he
bring
his
antagonist
to
the
earth
,
at
the
same
time
bestow
upon
him
some
desperate
blow
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
shall
go
to
the
same
element
from
which
I
take
thee
,
"
say
the
ferryman
,
"
and
there
swim
or
sink
as
thou
wilt
until
some
one
shall
drag
thee
ashore
,
and
when
they
do
,
may
they
have
a
well
return
than
I.
"
 
<EOS>
as
he
speak
,
he
drag
along
the
stranger
by
main
force
until
they
come
to
the
bank
of
the
river
,
and
then
pause
,
to
observe
the
deep
part
,
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
here
,
then
,
you
shall
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
vampyre
struggle
,
and
endeavour
to
speak
,
but
he
could
not
;
the
grasp
at
his
throat
prevent
all
attempt
at
speech
;
and
then
,
with
a
sudden
exertion
of
his
strength
,
the
ferryman
lift
the
stranger
up
,
and
heave
him
some
distance
into
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
then
in
deep
water
sink
the
body
.
 
<EOS>
the
ferryman
watch
for
some
moment
,
and
farther
down
the
stream
he
see
the
body
again
rise
upon
the
current
and
struggle
slightly
,
as
for
life
--
now
whirl
around
and
around
,
and
then
carry
forward
with
the
utmost
velocity
.
 
<EOS>
this
continue
as
far
as
the
moonlight
enable
the
ferryman
to
see
,
and
then
,
with
a
slow
step
and
cloud
brow
,
he
return
to
his
cottage

enter

CHILLINGWORTH
<EOS>
at
<EOS>
the
HALL.--THE
ENCOUNTER
of
MYSTERY.--THE
conflict.--the
RESCUE
,
and
the
PICTURE
.
  
<EOS>
[
illustration
]
 
there
have
be
many
event
that
have
pass
rapidly
in
this
our
narrative
;
but
more
have
yet
to
come
before
we
can
arrive
at
that
point
which
will
clear
up
much
that
appear
to
be
most
mysterious
and
unaccountable
.
 
<EOS>
Doctor
Chillingworth
,
but
ill
satisfied
with
the
event
that
have
yet
take
place
,
determine
once
more
upon
visit
the
Hall
,
and
there
to
attempt
a
discovery
of
something
respect
the
mysterious
apartment
in
which
so
much
have
already
take
place
.
 
<EOS>
He
communicate
his
design
to
no
one
;
he
resolve
to
prosecute
the
inquiry
alone
.
<EOS>
He
determine
to
go
there
and
await
whatever
may
turn
up
in
the
shape
of
event
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
for
once
take
any
companion
;
such
adventure
be
often
best
prosecute
alone
--
they
be
most
easily
bring
to
something
like
an
explanatory
position
,
one
person
can
often
consider
matter
more
coolly
than
more
.
<EOS>
at
all
event
,
there
be
more
secrecy
than
under
any
other
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
this
often
be
of
great
consequence
than
many
other
;
and
,
moreover
,
when
there
be
more
than
one
,
something
be
usually
overdo
.
<EOS>
where
one
adventurous
individual
will
rather
draw
back
in
a
pursuit
,
more
than
one
would
induce
them
to
urge
each
other
on
.
 
<EOS>
in
fact
,
one
in
such
a
case
could
act
the
part
of
a
spy
--
a
secret
observer
;
and
in
that
case
can
catch
people
at
time
when
they
could
not
under
any
other
circumstance
be
catch
or
observe
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
,
"
he
mutter
;
"
and
should
I
be
compel
to
run
away
again
,
why
,
nobody
know
anything
about
it
and
nobody
will
laugh
at
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
all
very
well
;
but
Mr.
Chillingworth
be
not
the
man
to
run
away
without
sufficient
cause
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
so
much
mystery
in
all
this
that
he
feel
much
interested
in
the
issue
of
the
affair
.
<EOS>
but
this
issue
he
could
not
command
;
at
the
same
time
he
be
determined
to
sit
and
watch
,
and
thus
become
certain
that
either
something
or
nothing
be
to
take
place
.
 
<EOS>
even
the
knowledge
of
that
much
--
that
some
inexplicable
action
be
still
go
on
--
be
far
preferable
to
the
uncertainty
of
not
know
whether
what
have
once
be
go
on
<EOS>
be
still
so
or
not
,
because
,
if
it
have
cease
,
it
be
probable
that
nothing
more
would
ever
be
know
concern
it
,
and
the
mystery
would
still
be
a
mystery
to
the
end
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
fathom
if
there
be
any
possibility
of
its
be
discover
,
"
mutter
chillingworth
.
<EOS>
"
who
would
have
think
that
so
quiet
and
orderly
a
spot
as
this
,
our
quiet
village
,
would
have
suffer
so
much
commotion
and
disturbance
?
<EOS>
far
from
every
cause
of
noise
and
strife
,
it
be
quite
as
great
a
matter
of
mystery
as
the
vampyre
business
itself
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
so
mixed
up
in
this
business
that
I
must
go
through
with
it
.
<EOS>
by
the
way
,
of
the
mystery
,
the
great
that
I
have
meet
with
be
the
fact
of
the
vampyre
have
anything
to
do
with
so
quiet
a
family
as
the
Bannerworths
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Chillingworth
ponder
over
the
thought
;
but
yet
he
could
make
nothing
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
in
no
way
tend
to
elucidate
anything
connect
with
the
affair
,
and
it
be
much
too
strange
and
singular
in
all
its
part
to
be
submit
to
any
process
of
thought
,
with
any
hope
of
come
to
anything
like
a
conclusion
upon
the
subject
--
that
must
remain
until
some
fact
be
ascertain
,
and
to
obtain
them
Mr.
Chillingworth
now
determine
to
try
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
precisely
what
be
most
desirable
in
the
present
state
of
affair
;
while
thing
remain
in
the
present
state
of
uncertainty
,
there
would
be
much
more
of
mystery
than
could
ever
be
bring
to
light
.
 
<EOS>
one
or
two
circumstance
clear
up
,
the
minor
one
would
follow
in
the
same
train
,
and
they
would
be
explain
by
the
other
;
and
if
ever
that
happy
state
of
thing
be
to
come
about
,
why
,
then
there
would
be
a
perfect
calm
in
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
as
Mr.
Chillingworth
be
go
along
,
he
think
he
observe
two
man
sit
inside
a
hedge
,
close
to
a
hay
-
rick
,
and
think
neither
of
them
have
any
business
there
,
he
determine
to
listen
to
their
conversation
,
and
ascertain
if
it
have
any
evil
tendency
,
or
whether
it
concern
the
late
event
.
 
<EOS>
have
approach
near
the
gate
,
and
they
be
on
the
other
side
,
he
get
over
without
any
noise
,
and
,
unperceived
by
either
of
them
,
creep
close
up
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
so
you
have
not
long
come
from
sea
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
have
just
land
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
be
it
you
have
throw
aside
your
seaman
's
clothe
and
take
to
these
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
just
to
escape
be
find
out
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
find
out
!
<EOS>
what
do
you
mean
by
that
?
<EOS>
have
you
be
up
to
anything
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
have
,
Jack
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
up
to
something
,
bad
luck
to
me
;
but
I
be
not
to
be
blame
either
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
all
about
?
"
inquire
his
companion
.
<EOS>
"
I
always
think
you
be
such
a
steady
-
go
old
file
that
there
be
no
go
out
of
the
even
path
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
nor
would
there
have
be
,
but
for
one
simple
circumstance
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
,
Jack
--
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
;
you
will
never
betray
me
,
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
never
,
by
heaven
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
listen
--
it
be
this
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
some
time
aboard
our
vessel
.
<EOS>
I
have
sail
before
,
but
the
captain
never
show
any
sign
of
be
a
bad
man
,
and
I
be
willing
enough
to
sail
with
him
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
know
I
be
engage
to
a
young
woman
in
this
country
,
and
that
I
be
willing
to
work
hard
to
save
money
to
make
up
a
comfortable
home
for
us
both
,
and
that
I
would
not
sail
again
,
but
that
I
intend
to
remain
ashore
,
and
make
up
my
mind
to
a
shore
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
you
would
have
a
house
then
?
<EOS>
"
 
"
<EOS>
exactly
;
and
that
be
what
I
wish
to
do
.
<EOS>
well
,
I
make
a
small
venture
in
the
cargo
,
and
think
,
by
so
do
,
that
I
should
have
a
chance
of
realize
a
sum
of
money
that
would
put
us
both
in
a
comfortable
line
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
we
go
on
very
smoothly
until
we
be
come
back
.
<EOS>
We
have
dispose
of
the
cargo
,
and
I
have
receive
some
money
,
and
this
seem
to
cause
our
captain
to
hate
me
,
because
I
have
be
successful
;
but
I
think
there
be
something
else
in
it
than
that
,
but
I
could
not
tell
what
it
be
that
make
him
so
intolerably
cross
and
tyrannous
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
find
out
,
at
length
,
he
know
my
intend
wife
.
<EOS>
He
know
her
very
well
,
and
at
the
same
time
he
make
every
effort
he
could
to
induce
me
to
commit
some
act
of
disobedience
and
insubordination
;
but
I
would
not
,
for
it
seem
to
me
he
be
try
all
he
could
to
prevent
my
do
my
duty
with
anything
like
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
"
however
,
I
learn
the
cause
of
all
this
afterwards
.
<EOS>
It
be
tell
me
by
one
of
the
crew

it
all
about

I
can
not

I
have
do

I
do
not

treat
in

It
be
all
about

indeed
!

I.

what
can
that
have
to
do
with
the

nothing

yes

do

I

now

I.
 
"
'
<EOS>
ay
,
and
so
can
a
blind
man
if
you
open
his
eye
;
but
he
want
to
make
you
do
wrong
--
to
goad
you
on
to
do
something
that
will
give
him
the
power
of
disgrace
you

,
perhaps
,
of
punish
you

He

I.

I
be
glad
to
hear
you

so

for
,
to
my

he
have
make
up
his
mind
to
go
the
whole
length
against
you

can
not

it
out

dead

I
dare

he
do

I
;

I
will
take
care

I
will
live
to
exact
a
reckoning
when

come
ashore

good

Mr.

get
to

have
he
see

that
could
in

<EOS>
indeed

he
have
shelter
himself
from
observation
at
every
point
of
his
road
,
especially
so
when
near
Bannerworth
Hall
,
where
there
be
plenty
of
corner
to
enable
him
to
do
so
;
and
when
he
arrive
there
,
he
enter
at
the
usual
spot
,
and
then
sit
down
a
few
moment
in
the
bower

be
sure
such
a

never

heart

surely
,
it
be
more
calculated

it

utterly

with

do

there
be
a
fair
struggle
for
more
than
two
or
three
minute
,
during
which
the
doctor
struggle
and
fight
most
manfully
;
but
it
be
evident
that
Mr.

have
meet
with
a
man
who
be
his

not

Remarkable
be
the
change
that
have
take
place
in
the
circumstance
of
the
Bannerworth
family
.
<EOS>
from
a
state
of
great
despondency
,
and
,
indeed
,
absolute
poverty
,
they
have
suddenly
rise
to
comfort
and
independence
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
the
cloud
that
have
obscure
their
destiny
,
have
now
,
with
one
accord
,
dissipate
,
and
that
a
bright
day
be
dawn
.
<EOS>
not
only
have
the
circumstance
of
mental
terror
which
have
surround
them
give
way
in
a
great
measure
to
the
light
of
truth
and
reflection
,
but
those
pecuniary
distress
which
have
press
upon
them
for
a
time
,
be
likewise
pass
away
,
and
it
seem
probable
that
they
would
be
in
a
prosperous
condition
.
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
the
acquisition
of
the
title
deed
of
the
estate

,
which
they
think
have
pass
away
from
the
family
for
ever
,
become
to
them
,
in
their
present
circumstance
,
an
immense
acquisition
,
and
bring
to
their
mind
a
feeling
of
great
contentment
.
 
<EOS>
many
person
in
their
situation
would
have
be
extremely
satisfied
at
have
secure
so
strong
an
interest
in
the
mind
of
the
old
admiral
,
who
be
very
wealthy
,
and
who
,
from
what
he
have
already
say
and
do
,
no
doubt
fully
intend
to
provide
handsomely
for
the
Bannerworth
family
.
 
<EOS>
and
not
only
have
they
this
to
look
forward
to
,
if
they
have
choose
to
regard
it
as
an
advantage
,
but
they
know
that
by
the
marriage
of
Flora
with
Charles
Holland
she
would
have
a
fortune
at
her
disposal
,
while
he
(
Charles
)
would
be
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
demur
at
any
reasonable
amount
of
it
be
lavish
upon
her
mother
and
her
brother
.
 
<EOS>
but
all
this
do
not
suit
the
high
and
independent
spirit
of
Henry
Bannerworth
.
<EOS>
He
be
one
who
would
rather
have
eat
the
dust
that
he
procure
for
himself
by
some
meritorious
exertion
,
than
have
feast
on
the
most
delicate
viand
place
before
him
from
the
resource
of
another
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
that
he
know
this
small
estate
,
the
title
deed
of
which
have
be
so
singularly
obtain
,
have
once
really
belong
to
the
family
,
but
have
be
risk
and
lose
at
the
gaming
-
table
,
he
have
no
earthly
scruple
in
call
such
property
again
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
large
sum
of
money
which
Sir
Francis
Varney
in
his
confession
have
declare
to
have
find
its
way
into
the
possession
of
Marmaduke
Bannerworth
,
Henry
do
not
expect
,
and
scarcely
wish
to
become
possess
of
wealth
through
so
taint
a
source
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
he
say
to
himself
frequently
;
"
no
--
I
care
not
if
that
wealth
be
never
forthcoming
,
which
be
so
badly
get
possession
of
.
<EOS>
let
it
sink
into
the
earth
,
if
,
indeed
,
it
be
bury
there
;
or
let
it
rot
in
some
unknown
corner
of
the
old
mansion
.
<EOS>
I
care
not
for
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
in
this
view
of
the
case
he
be
not
alone
,
for
a
family
more
unselfish
,
or
who
care
so
little
for
money
,
could
scarcely
have
be
find
;
but
Admiral
Bell
and
Charles
Holland
argue
now
that
they
have
a
right
to
the
amount
of
money
which
Marmaduke
Bannerworth
have
hide
somewhere
,
and
the
old
admiral
reason
upon
it
rather
ingeniously
,
for
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
do
not
mean
to
dispute
that
the
money
belong
to
somebody
,
and
in
that
case
I
should
like
to
know
who
else
it
belong
to
,
if
not
to
you
?
<EOS>
how
do
you
get
over
that
,
master
Henry
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
attempt
to
get
over
it
at
all
,
"
say
Henry
;
"
all
I
say
be
,
that
I
do
dislike
the
whole
circumstance
connect
with
it
,
and
the
manner
in
which
it
be
come
by
;
and
,
now
that
we
have
a
small
independence
,
I
hope
it
will
not
be
find
.
<EOS>
but
,
admiral
,
we
be
go
to
hold
a
family
consultation
as
to
what
we
shall
do
,
and
what
be
to
become
of
Varney
.
<EOS>
He
have
convince
me
of
his
relationship
to
our
family
,
and
,
although
his
conduct
have
certainly
be
extremely
equivocal
,
he
have
make
all
the
amend
in
his
power
;
and
now
,
as
he
be
get
old
,
I
do
not
like
to
throw
him
upon
the
wide
world
for
a
subsistence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
contemplate
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
"
let
him
remain
with
you
,
do
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
;
that
would
be
objectionable
for
a
variety
of
reason
;
and
I
could
not
think
of
it
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
not
.
<EOS>
the
idea
of
sit
down
to
breakfast
,
dinner
,
tea
,
and
supper
with
a
vampyre
,
and
take
your
grog
with
a
fellow
that
suck
other
people
's
blood
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
really
,
admiral
,
you
do
not
really
still
cling
to
the
idea
that
Sir
Francis
Varney
be
a
vampyre
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
really
do
not
know
;
he
cling
to
it
himself
,
that
be
all
I
can
say
;
and
I
think
,
under
those
circumstance
,
I
may
as
well
give
him
the
benefit
of
his
own
proposition
,
and
suppose
that
he
be
a
vampyre
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
really
,
uncle
,
"
say
Charles
Holland
,
"
I
do
think
that
you
have
discard
the
notion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
?
<EOS>
I
have
be
think
of
it
,
and
it
be
not
so
desirable
to
be
a
vampyre
,
I
be
sure
,
that
any
one
should
pretend
to
it
who
be
not
;
therefore
,
I
take
the
fellow
upon
his
own
showing
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
vampyre
in
his
own
opinion
,
and
so
I
do
not
see
,
for
the
life
of
me
,
why
he
should
not
be
so
in
ours
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
wave
all
that
,
what
be
we
to
do
with
him
?
<EOS>
circumstance
seem
to
have
throw
him
completely
at
our
mercy
.
<EOS>
what
be
we
to
do
with
him
,
and
what
be
to
become
of
him
for
the
future
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
I
will
do
,
"
say
the
admiral
.
<EOS>
"
if
he
be
ten
time
a
vampyre
,
there
be
some
good
in
the
fellow
;
and
I
will
give
him
enough
to
live
upon
if
he
will
go
to
America
and
spend
it
.
<EOS>
They
will
take
good
care
there
that
he
suck
no
blood
out
of
them
;
for
,
although
an
American
would
always
rather
lose
a
drop
of
blood
than
a
dollar
,
they
keep
a
pretty
sharp
look
out
upon
both
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
proposal
can
be
make
to
him
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
at
all
event
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
which
I
do
not
dislike
,
and
probably
one
that
he
would
embrace
at
once
;
because
he
seem
,
to
me
,
to
have
completely
do
with
ambition
,
and
to
have
abandon
those
project
concern
which
,
at
one
time
,
he
take
such
a
world
of
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
trust
to
that
,
"
say
the
admiral
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
breed
in
the
bone
do
not
so
easily
get
out
of
the
flesh
;
and
once
or
twice
,
when
Master
Varney
have
be
talk
,
I
have
see
those
odd
looking
eye
of
his
flash
up
for
a
moment
,
as
if
he
be
quite
ready
to
begin
his
old
caper
again
,
and
alarm
the
whole
country
side
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
confess
,
"
say
Charles
Holland
,
"
that
I
myself
have
have
the
impression
once
or
twice
that
Varney
be
only
subdue
for
a
time
,
and
that
,
with
a
proper
amount
of
provocation
,
he
would
become
again
a
very
serious
fellow
,
and
to
the
full
as
troublesome
as
he
have
be
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
doubt
his
sincerity
?
"
say
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
do
not
do
that
,
Henry
:
I
think
Varney
fully
mean
what
he
say
;
but
I
think
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
he
have
for
so
long
lead
a
strange
,
wild
,
and
reckless
life
,
that
he
will
find
it
very
far
from
easy
,
if
indeed
possible
,
to
shake
off
his
old
habit
and
settle
down
quietly
,
if
not
to
say
comfortably
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
regret
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
that
you
have
such
an
impression
;
but
,
<EOS>
while
I
do
so
,
I
can
not
help
admit
that
it
be
,
to
a
considerable
extent
,
no
more
than
a
reasonable
one
;
and
perhaps
,
after
all
,
my
expectation
that
Varney
will
give
us
no
more
trouble
,
<EOS>
only
amount
to
a
hope
that
he
will
not
do
so
,
and
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
but
let
us
consider
;
there
seem
to
be
some
slight
difference
of
opinion
among
us
,
as
to
whether
we
should
take
up
our
residence
at
this
new
house
of
ours
,
which
we
do
not
know
we
own
,
at
Dearbrook
,
or
proceed
to
London
,
and
there
establish
ourselves
,
or
again
return
to
Bannerworth
Hall
,
and
,
by
a
judicious
expenditure
of
some
money
,
make
that
a
more
habitable
place
than
it
have
be
for
the
last
twenty
year
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
now
,
I
will
tell
you
what
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
"
I
would
do
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
out
of
the
question
for
any
body
to
live
long
unless
they
see
a
ship
;
do
not
you
think
so
,
Miss
Flora
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
how
can
you
ask
Flora
such
a
question
,
uncle
,
"
say
Charles
Holland
,
"
when
you
know
she
do
not
care
a
straw
about
ship
,
and
only
look
upon
admiral
as
natural
curiosity
?
<EOS>
"
 
"
except
one
,
"
say
Flora
,
"
and
he
be
an
admiral
who
be
natural
but
no
curiosity
,
unless
it
be
that
you
,
can
call
him
such
because
he
be
so
just
and
generous
,
and
,
as
for
ship
,
who
can
help
admire
them
;
and
if
Admiral
Bell
propose
that
we
live
in
some
pleasant
,
marine
villa
by
the
sea
-
coast
,
he
shall
have
my
vote
and
interest
for
the
proceeding
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Bravo
!
Huzza
!
"
cry
the
admiral
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
it
be
,
Master
Charley
--
<EOS>
you
horse
marine,--I
have
a
great
mind
to
cut
you
out
,

have
Miss
Flora
myself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
not

uncle

Charles

that
would
be

very
cruel

me
so
faithfully

how
do
you
suppose
I
should
like
it
;
come
now

be
merciful

"
 
<EOS>
at
this
moment
,
and
before
any
one
could
make
another
remark
,
there
come
rather
a
sharp
ring
at
the
garden

gate
bell
,
and
Henry
exclaimed,--
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
Mr.
Chillingworth

I
be
glad

have
come
in
time
to
join
our
conference

<EOS>
His
advice
be
always
valuable
;

,
moreover
,
I
rather
think
he
will
bring
us
some
news
worth
the
hearing

"
 
<EOS>
the
one
servant
who
they
have
to
wait
upon
them
look
into
the
room
,

said,--"if

<EOS>
"
Mistress

<EOS>
you

no

the
devil

dart
into

I
will
soon
let
you

you
great

crab

one
thing

another
,
I
have
not
have
him
at
home
an
hour

past
three

I
to

<EOS>
there
be
all
his

get
well
as
fast

can
without
him

,
when

out

do
you
think
they
will
take
any
more
filthy
physic

<EOS>
no

to
be
sure
not

people
be
not
such
fool

do
anything
of
the
sort

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
we
will
do

will
all
get
ill
at

begin

<EOS>
"
You
be
an
old
porpoise

I
believe
it
all
owe
to
you
that
my

neglect
his

family

<EOS>
what
be
vampyre
to
him
,
I
should
like
to
know

that
he
should
go
troubling
about
them

I
never

draught

no

nor
any
body
else
that
have
the
sense

if
it
be
your

you
want

it
be
no
use
your
looking
for

for
here

then
where

he

He
be
run
after
some
of

somewhere

will
be
bind

you
know

to
send
for
him

you
be
mistaken

indeed

we
do
not

We
want

ourselves

can
not

that
be
the
fact

<EOS>

It
be

very
well

if
you
be
a

with
a

about
you

at

you

I
be
d----d

as
for
the
last

madam

I
would
soon
settle
that

I
would
wring

Mrs.

no

wish

some

out
Varney

;
but
suppose
we
now
at
once
make
the
proposal
we
be
think
of
to
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
and
so
get
him
to
leave
England
as
quickly
as
possible
and
put
an
end
to
the
possibility
of
his
be
any
more
trouble
to
anybody
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
agree
--
agree
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
good
thing
that
can
be
do
,
and
it
will
be
something
gain
to
get
his
consent
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
run
up
stair
to
him
,
"
say
Charles
,
"
and
call
him
down
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
scarcely
doubt
for
a
moment
his
acquiescence
in
the
proposal
.
"
 
<EOS>
Charles
Holland
rise
,
and
run
up
the
little
staircase
of
the
cottage
to
the
room
which
,
by
the
kindness
of
the
Bannerworth
family
,
have
be
devote
to
the
use
of
Varney
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
go
above
two
minute
,
when
he
return
,
hastily
,
with
a
small
scrap
of
paper
in
his
hand
,
which
he
lay
before
Henry
,
saying,--
 
<EOS>
"
there
,
what
think
you
of
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
Henry
,
upon
take
up
the
paper
,
see
write
upon
it
the
words,--
 
"
_
<EOS>
the
Farewell
of
Varney
the
Vampyre
_
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
go
,
"
say
Charles
Holland
.
<EOS>
"
the
room
be
vacant
.
<EOS>
I
see
at
a
glance
that
he
have
remove
his
hat
,
and
cloak
,
and
all
that
belong
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
off
,
and
at
so
short
a
warning
,
and
in
so
abrupt
a
manner
,
that
I
fear
the
bad
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
can
you
fear
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
scarcely
know
what
;
but
we
have
a
right
to
fear
everything
and
anything
from
his
most
inexplicable
being
,
whose
whole
conduct
have
be
of
that
mysterious
nature
,
as
to
put
him
past
all
calculation
as
regard
his
motive
,
his
object
,
or
his
action
.
<EOS>
I
must
confess
that
I
would
have
hail
his
departure
from
England
with
feeling
of
satisfaction
;
but
what
he
mean
now
,
by
this
strange
manoeuvre
,
Heaven
,
and
his
own
singular
intellect
,
can
alone
divine
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
confess
,
"
say
Flora
,
"
I
should
not
at
all
have
think
this
of
Varney
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
as
if
something
new
must
have
occur
to
him
.
<EOS>
altogether
,
I
do
not
feel
any
alarm
concern
his
action
as
regard
us
.
<EOS>
I
be
convince
of
his
sincerity
,
and
,
therefore
,
do
not
view
with
sensation
of
uneasiness
this
new
circumstance
,
which
appear
at
present
so
inexplicable
,
but
for
which
we
may
yet
get
some
explanation
that
will
be
satisfactory
to
us
all
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
conceive
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
what
new
circumstance
could
have
occur
to
produce
this
effect
upon
Varney
.
<EOS>
thing
remain
just
as
they
be
;
and
,
after
all
,
situate
as
he
be
,
if
any
change
have
take
place
in
matter
out
of
door
,
I
do
not
see
how
he
could
become
acquainted
with
them
,
so
that
his
leaving
must
have
be
a
matter
of
mere
calculation
,
or
of
impulse
at
the
moment
<EOS>
--
Heaven
know
which
--
but
can
have
nothing
to
do
with
actual
information
,
because
it
be
quite
evident
he
could
not
get
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
rather
strange
,
"
say
Charles
Holland
,
"
that
just
as
we
be
speculate
upon
the
probability
of
his
do
something
of
this
sort
,
he
should
suddenly
do
it
,
and
in
this
singular
manner
too
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
"
say
the
old
admiral
,
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
I
see
his
eye
,
that
be
enough
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
would
do
something
,
as
well
as
<EOS>
I
know
a
mainmast
from
a
chain
cable
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
help
it
;
it
be
in
the
nature
of
the
beast
,
and
that
be
all
you
can
say
about
it

CHAPTER
XCII
.
 
<EOS>
the
misadventure
of
the
DOCTOR
with
the
PICTURE
.
  
<EOS>
the
situation
of
Dr.
Chillingworth
and
Jack
Pringle
be
not
of
that
character
that
permit
much
conversation
or
even
congratulation
.
<EOS>
They
be
victor
it
be
true
,
and
yet
they
have
but
little
to
boast
of
besides
the
victory
.
 
<EOS>
victory
be
a
great
thing
;
it
be
like
a
gilded
coat
,
it
bewilder
and
dazzle
.
<EOS>
nobody
can
say
much
when
you
be
victorious
.
<EOS>
what
a
sound
!
<EOS>
and
yet
how
much
misery
be
there
not
hide
beneath
it
.
 
<EOS>
this
victory
of
the
worthy
doctor
and
his
aid
amount
to
this
,
they
be
as
they
be
before
,
without
be
any
better
,
but
much
the
bad
,
see
they
be
so
much
buffette
that
they
could
hardly
speak
,
but
sit
for
some
moment
opposite
to
each
other
,
gasp
for
breath
,
and
stare
each
other
in
the
face
without
speak
.
 
<EOS>
the
moonlight
come
in
through
the
window
and
fall
upon
the
floor
,
and
there
be
no
sound
that
come
to
disturb
the
stillness
of
the
scene
,
nor
any
object
that
move
to
cast
a
shadow
upon
the
floor
.
<EOS>
all
be
still
and
motionless
,
save
the
two
victor
,
who
be
much
distressed
and
bruise
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
!
"
say
Jack
Pringle
,
with
a
hearty
execration
,
as
he
wipe
his
face
with
the
back
of
his
hand
;
"
save
your
presence
,
doctor
,
we
be
master
of
the
field
,
doctor
;
but
it
be
plaguey
like
capture
an
empty
bandbox
after
a
hard
fight
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
we
have
get
the
picture
,
Jack
--
we
have
get
the
picture
,
you
see
,
and
that
be
something
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
we
save
that
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
that
may
be
;
and
a
pretty
d----d
look
picture
it
be
after
all
.
<EOS>
why
,
it
be
enough
to
frighten
a
lady
into
the
sulk
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
if
it
be
burn
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
I
would
sooner
see
it
burn
than
in
the
hand
of
that--
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
?
"
exclaim
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
;
"
but
thief
I
should
say
,
for
it
be
somewhat
thief
-
like
to
break
into
another
man
's
house
and
carry
off
the
furniture
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
pirate
--
a
regular
land
shark
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
something
that
be
not
the
same
as
an
honest
man
,
Jack
;
but
,
at
all
event
,
we
have
beat
him
back
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Jack
,
"
the
ship
be
clear
;
no
company
be
well
than
bad
company
,
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
it
be
,
and
yet
it
do
not
seem
clear
in
term
.
<EOS>
but
,
Jack
,
it
you
have
not
come
in
time
,
I
should
have
be
but
scurvily
treat
.
<EOS>
He
be
too
powerful
for
me
;
I
be
as
nigh
be
kill
as
ever
I
have
be
;
but
you
be
just
in
time
to
save
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
he
be
a
large
,
ugly
fellow
,
sure
enough
,
and
look
like
an
old
tree
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
see
him
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
to
be
sure
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
could
not
catch
a
glimpse
of
his
feature
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
I
be
too
much
employ
to
see
anything
,
and
it
be
much
too
dark
to
notice
anything
particular
,
even
if
I
have
have
leisure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
have
as
much
to
do
as
you
could
well
manage
,
I
must
say
that
,
at
all
event
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
much
of
him
myself
;
only
he
be
a
tall
,
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
sort
of
chap
--
a
long
-
legged
shark
.
<EOS>
He
give
me
such
a
dig
or
two
as
I
have
not
have
for
a
long
while
,
nor
do
not
want
to
get
again
;
though
I
do
not
care
if
I
face
the
devil
himself
.
<EOS>
a
man
can
not
do
more
than
do
his
good
,
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
Jack
;
but
there
be
very
few
who
do
do
their
good
,
and
that
be
the
truth
.
<EOS>
You
have
,
and
have
do
it
to
some
purpose
too
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
have
enough
for
one
day
;
he
be
almost
strong
enough
to
contend
against
us
both
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
so
he
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
,
besides
that
,
he
almost
carry
away
the
picture
--
<EOS>
that
be
a
great
hindrance
to
him
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
we
could
have
hold
him
if
we
have
not
be
fight
over
the
picture
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
to
be
sure
we
could
;
we
could
have
go
at
him
bodily
,
and
hold
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
have
be
able
to
use
his
hand
.
<EOS>
We
could
have
hang
on
him
,
and
I
be
sure
if
I
come
to
grapple
yard
-
arm
and
yard
-
arm
,
he
would
have
tell
a
different
tale
;
however
,
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
.
<EOS>
how
long
have
you
be
here
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
very
long
,
"
reply
the
doctor
,
whose
head
be
a
little
confused
by
the
blow
which
he
have
receive
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
now
tell
how
long
,
but
only
a
short
time
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
where
do
he
come
from
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
from
,
Jack
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
doctor
,
where
do
he
come
from?--the
window
,
I
suppose
--
the
same
way
he
go
out
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
--
<EOS>
it
be
most
likely
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
,
no
;
he
come
down
from
behind
the
picture
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
mystery
in
that
picture
,
I
will
swear
to
it
;
it
be
very
strange
<EOS>
he
should
make
such
a
desperate
attempt
to
carry
it
away
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
one
would
think
,
"
say
Jack
,
"
there
be
more
in
it
than
we
can
see
--
<EOS>
that
it
be
worth
more
than
we
can
believe
;
perhaps
somebody
set
particular
store
by
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
shake
his
head
,
"
I
do
not
know
how
that
may
be
;
but
certain
it
be
,
the
picture
be
the
object
of
his
visit
here
--
that
be
very
certain
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
;
he
be
endeavour
to
carry
it
off
,
"
say
Jack
;
"
it
would
be
a
very
good
ornament
to
the
black
hole
at
Calcutta
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
utility
of
put
it
where
it
can
not
be
see
,
"
remark
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
"
I
can
not
very
well
see
;
though
I
dare
say
it
may
be
all
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
--
its
ugly
feature
would
be
no
longer
see
;
so
far
,
it
would
be
a
good
job
.
<EOS>
but
be
you
go
to
remain
here
all
night
,
and
so
make
a
long
watch
of
it
,
doctor
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
Jack
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
I
do
intend
watch
here
;
but
now
the
game
be
disturb
,
it
be
of
no
use
remain
here
.
<EOS>
We
have
secure
the
picture
,
and
now
there
will
be
no
need
of
remain
in
the
house
;
in
fact
,
there
be
no
fear
of
robbery
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
so
long
as
we
be
here
,
"
say
Jack
Pringle
;
"
the
smuggler
will
not
show
a
head
while
the
revenue
cutter
be
on
the
look
out
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
not
,
Jack
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
;
"
I
think
we
have
scare
them
away
--
the
picture
be
safe
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
--
so
long
as
we
be
here
.
"
 
<EOS>

and
longer
,
too
,
I
hope
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jack
shake
his
head
,
as
much
as
to
intimate
that
he
have
many
doubt
upon
such
a
point
,
and
could
not
be
hurry
into
any
concession
of
opinion
of
the
safety
of
such
a
picture
as
that
--
much
as
he
dislike
it
,
and
as
poor
an
opinion
as
he
have
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
think
it
will
be
safe
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
why
not
?
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
willing
to
hear
what
Jack
could
advance
against
the
opinion
he
have
express
,
especially
as
he
have
disturb
the
marauder
in
the
very
act
of
robbery
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
will
be
watch
by
this
very
man
;
and
when
you
be
go
,
he
will
return
in
safety
,
and
take
this
plaguey
picture
away
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
he
may
do
so
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
after
some
thought
;
"
he
even
endanger
his
own
escape
for
the
purpose
of
carry
it
off
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
want
it
,
"
say
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
,
the
picture
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
aye
,
to
be
sure
;
do
you
think
anybody
would
have
try
so
hard
to
get
away
with
it
?
<EOS>
He
want
it
;
and
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
be
,
he
will
have
it
,
despite
all
that
can
be
do
to
prevent
it
;
that
be
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
there
be
much
truth
in
that
;

what
to
do
I
do
not
know

"
 
<EOS>
"
take
it
to
the
cottage
,
"
suggest
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
the
picture
must
be
more
than
we
think
for
;
suppose
we
carry
it
along
.

plan
of
yours

;
"
and
,
though
a
little
awkward
,
yet
it
be
not
the
bad
I
have
hear
;
but
--
<EOS>
but
--
what
will
they
say
,
when
they
see
this
frightful
face
in
that
quiet
,
yet
contented
house
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
they
will
say
you
bring
it
,
"
say
Jack
;
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
what
else
they
can
say
,
but
that
you
have
do
well
;
besides
,
when
you
come
to
explain
,
you
will
make
the
matter
all
right
to
'
em
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
"
say
Chillingworth
;
"
and
,
as
the
picture
now
seem
to
be
the
incomprehensible
object
of
attack
,
I
will
secure
that
,
at
all
event
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
help
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
Jack
;
your
aid
will
be
welcome
;
at
least
,
it
be
so
just
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
all
right
,
doctor
,
"
say
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
be
under
your
hand
some
day
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
physic
you
for
nothing
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
.
<EOS>
"
You
save
my
life

<EOS>
one
good
turn
deserve
another

I
will
not
forget
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
"
say
Jack
,
as
he
make
a
wry
face
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
will
not
have
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
would
sooner
have
a
can
of
grog
than
any
bottle
of
medicine
you
can
give
me
;
I
be
not
ungrateful
,
neither
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
name
it
;
I
be
get
my
breath
again
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
have
better
leave
this
place
,
as
soon
as
we
conveniently
can
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
exactly
.
<EOS>
the
sooner
the
well
;
we
can
take
it
the
more
leisurely
as
we
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
moon
be
up
;
there
be
no
cloud
now
,
but
there
be
not
a
very
strong
light
,
because
the
moon
be
on
the
wane
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
those
night
during
which
an
imperceptible
vapour
arise
,
and
render
the
moon
somewhat
obscure
,
or
,
at
least
,
it
rob
the
earth
of
her
ray
;
and
then
there
be
shadow
cast
by
the
moon
,
yet
they
grow
fainter
,
and
those
cast
upon
the
floor
of
the
apartment
be
less
distinct
than
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
there
seem
scarce
a
breath
of
air
stirring
;
everything
be
quiet
and
still
;
no
motion
--
no
sound
,
save
that
of
the
breathing
of
the
two
who
sit
in
that
mysterious
apartment
,
who
gaze
alternately
round
the
place
,
and
then
in
each
other
's
countenance
.
<EOS>
suddenly
,
the
silence
of
the
night
be
disturb
by
a
very
slight
,
but
distinct
noise
,
which
strike
upon
them
with
peculiar
distinctness
;
<EOS>
it
be
a
gentle
tap
,
tap
,
at
the
window
,
as
if
some
one
be
do
it
with
their
fingernail
.
 
<EOS>
They
gaze
on
each
other
,
for
some
moment
,
in
amazement
,
and
then
at
the
window
,
but
they
see
nothing
;
and
yet
,
have
there
be
anything
,
they
must
have
see
it
,
but
there
be
not
even
a
shadow
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
after
he
have
listen
to
the
tap
,
tap
,
several
time
,
without
be
able
to
find
out
or
imagine
what
it
could
arise
from
,
"
what
on
earth
can
it
be
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
know
,
"
say
Jack
,
very
composedly
,
squint
up
at
the
window
.
<EOS>
"
can
not
see
anything
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
but
it
must
be
something
,
"
persist
Mr.
Chillingworth
;
"
it
must
be
something
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
it
be
;
but
I
do
not

anything

<EOS>
I
can
not

what
it
can
be

"
 
<EOS>
"
unless
what
?
<EOS>
speak
out
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
impatiently
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
unless
it
be
Davy
Jones
himself

with
his
long

us
as

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
,
I
presume
,
we
may
as
well
go
;
and
yet
I
be
more
disposed
to
deem
it
some
device
of
the
enemy
to
dislodge
us
from
this
place
,
for
the
purpose
of
enable
them
to
effect
some
nefarious
scheme

other
they
have
afloat
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
,

be

I
dare
say
,
a
do
of
some
sort

other

say
Jack
;
"
but
what
'
can
it
be
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
it
be
again
,
"
say
the
doctor
;
"
do
not
you
hear
it
?
<EOS>
I
can
,
as
plain
as
I
can
hear
myself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Jack
;
"
I
can
hear
it
plain
enough
,
and
can
see
it
,
too
;
and
that
be
more
.
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
I
can
tell
all
about
it
plain
enough
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
?
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
shew
me
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
as
he
stride
up
to
the
window
,
before
which
Jack
be
stand
gaze
upon
one
particular
spot
of
the
shatter
window
with
much
earnestness
.
 
<EOS>
"
where
be
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
look
there
,
"
say
Jack
,
point
with
his
finger
to
a
particular
spot
,
to
which
the
doctor
direct
his
attention
,
expect
to
see
a
long
,
skinny
hand
tap
against
the
glass
;
but
he
see
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
"
where
be
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
see
that
twig
of
ivy
,
or
something
of
the
sort
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
watch
that
;
and
when
the
wind
catch
it
--
and
there
be
but
very
little
--
it
lift
it
up
,
and
then
,
fall
down
again
,
it
tap
the
glass
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
just
as
he
speak
,
there
come
a
slight
gust
of
wind
;
and
it
give
a
practical
illustration
to
his
word
;
for
the
tapping
be
hear
as
often
as
the
plant
be
move
by
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
,
"
however
simple
and
unimportant
the
matter
may
be
,
yet
<EOS>
I
can
not
but
say
I
be
always
well
pleased
to
find
a
practical
explanation
of
it
,
so
that
there
will
be
no
part
leave
in
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
none
about
that
,
"
say
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
none
.
<EOS>
well
,
we
be
not
beset
,
then
.
<EOS>
We
may
as
well
consider
of
the
manner
of
our
get
clear
of
this
place
.
<EOS>
what
sort
of
burthen
this
picture
may
be
I
know
not
;
but
I
will
make
the
attempt
to
carry
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Avast
,
there
,
"
say
Jack
;
"
I
will
carry
it
:
at
all
event
,
I
will
take
the
first
spell
,
and
,
if
I
can
not
go
on
,
we
will
turn
and
turn
about
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
can
divide
the
weight
from
the
first
,
and
then
neither
of
us
will
be
tired
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
just
as
you
please
,
sir
,
"
say
Jack
Pringle
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
willing
to
obey
order
;
and
,
if
we
be
to
get
in
to
-
night
before
they
be
all
a
-
bed
,
we
have
better
go
at
once
;
and
then
we
shall
not
disturb
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Good
,
Jack
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
;
"
very
good
:
<EOS>
let
us
begin
to
beat
our
retreat
at
once
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
good
,
"
say
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
rise
and
approach
the
picture
,
which
stand
up
in
one
corner
,
half
recline
against
the
wall
;
the
light
,
at
least
so
much
as
there
be
,
fall
upon
it
,
and
give
it
a
ghastly
and
deathly
hue
,
which
make
Mr.
Chillingworth
feel
an
emotion
he
could
not
at
all
understand
;
<EOS>
but
,
as
soon
as
he
could
,
he
withdraw
his
eye
from
off
the
picture
,
and
they
proceed
to
secure
it
with
some
cord
,
so
that
they
may
carry
it
between
them
<EOS>
the
easy
--
with
less
trouble
and
more
safety
.
 
<EOS>
these
preparation
do
not
take
long
in
making
,
and
,
when
complete
,
they
give
another
inquiring
look
round
the
chamber
,
and
Mr.
Chillingworth
again
approach
the
window
,
and
gaze
out
upon
the
garden
below
,
but
see
nothing
to
attract
his
attention
.
 
<EOS>
turn
away
,
he
come
to
the
picture
,
with
which
Jack
Pringle
have
be
stand
.
<EOS>
They
proceed
towards
the
stair
,
adopt
every
precaution
they
could
take
to
prevent
any
surprise
and
any
attempt
upon
the
object
of
their
solicitude
.
 
<EOS>
then
they
come
to
the
great
hall
,
and
,
have
open
the
door
,
they
carry
it
out
;
then
shut
the
door
,
they
both
stand
outside
of
Bannerworth
Hall
;
and
,
before
take
the
picture
up
in
their
hand
,
they
once
more
look
suspiciously
around
them
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
to
be
see
,
and
so
,
shoulder
the
ominous
portrait
<EOS>
,
they
proceed
along
the
garden
till
they
convey
it
into
the
roadway
.
 
<EOS>
"
now
,
"
say
Jack
,
"
we
be
off
;
we
can
scud
along
under
press
of
sail
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
not
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
for
two
reason
;
one
of
which
be
,
I
can
not
do
it
myself
,
and
<EOS>
the
other
be
,
we
should
run
the
risk
of
injure
the
picture
;
besides
this
,
there
be
no
reason
for
so
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
say
Jack
,
"
make
it
agreeable
to
yourself
,
doctor
.
<EOS>
see
you
,
Jack
's
alive
,
and
I
be
willing
to
do
all
I
can
to
help
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
of
your
aid
,
"
say
Mr.
Chillingworth
;
"
so
we
will
proceed
slowly
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
glad
when
we
be
there
;
for
there
be
few
thing
more
awkward
than
this
picture
to
carry
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
heavy
,
"
say
Jack
,
<EOS>
give
it
a
hitch
up
,
that
first
pull
the
doctor
back
,
and
then
push
him
forward
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
;
but
stop
,
do
not
do
that
often
,
Jack
,
or
else
I
shall
be
oblige
to
let
go
,
to
save
myself
from
fall
,
"
say
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
very
sorry
<EOS>
,
"
say
Jack
;
"
hope
it
do
not
inconvenience
you
;
but
I
could
carry
this
by
myself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
could
I
,
"
return
Mr.
Chillingworth
;
"
but
the
probability
be
there
would
be
some
mischief
do
to
it
,
and
then
we
should
be
do
more
harm
than
good
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
we
should
,
"
say
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
They
proceed
along
with
much
care
and
caution
.
<EOS>
It
be
grow
late
now
,
and
no
one
be
about
--
<EOS>
at
least
,
they
meet
none
.
<EOS>
People
do
not
roam
about
much
after
dark
,
especially
since
the
report
of
the
vampyre
become
current
,
for
,
notwithstanding
all
their
bravery
and
violence
while
in
a
body
,
yet
to
meet
and
contend
with
him
singly
,
and
unseen
,
be
not
at
all
a
popular
notion
among
them
;
indeed
,
they
would
sooner
go
a
mile
out
of
their
way
,
or
remain
in
door
,
which
they
usually
do
.
 
<EOS>
the
evening
be
not
precisely
dark
,
there
be
moonlight
enough
to
save
it
from
that
,
but
there
be
a
mist
hang
about
,
that
render
object
,
at
a
short
distance
,
very
indistinct
.
 
<EOS>
Their
walk
be
uninterrupted
by
any
one
,
and
they
have
get
through
half
the
distance
without
any
disturbance
or
interruption
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
arrive
at
the
precinct
of
the
village
,
Jack
Pringle
say
to
Dr.
Chillingworth
,
"
do
you
intend
go
through
the
village
,
doctor
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
not
?
<EOS>
there
will
be
nobody
about
,
and
if
there
should
be
,
we
shall
be
safe
enough
from
any
molestation
,
see
there
be
none
here
who
would
dare
to
harm
us
<EOS>
;
it
be
the
short
way
,
too
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
good
,
"
say
Jack
;
"
I
be
agreeable
,
and
as
for
any
one
harm
me
,
they
know
better
;
but
,
at
all
event
,
there
be
company
,
and
there
be
less
danger
,
you
know
,
doctor
;
though
I
be
always
company
to
myself
,
but
have
not
any
objection
to
a
messmate
,
now
and
then
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
pursue
their
way
in
silence
,
for
some
distance
,
the
doctor
not
care
about
continue
the
talk
of
Jack
,
which
amount
to
nothing
;
besides
,
he
have
too
much
to
do
,
for
,
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
lightness
of
the
picture
,
which
Jack
have
endeavour
to
persuade
the
doctor
of
,
he
find
it
be
heavy
and
ungainly
;
indeed
,
have
he
be
by
himself
<EOS>
he
would
have
have
some
trouble
to
have
get
it
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
be
nearly
there
,
"
say
Jack
,
put
down
his
end
of
the
picture
,
which
bring
Doctor
Chillingworth
to
a
standstill
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
we
be
;
but
what
make
you
stop
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
see
,
"
say
Jack
,
give
his
trowser
a
hitch
,
"
as
I
say
before
,
we
be
nearly
there
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
we
intend
to
go
there
,
do
we
not
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
Chillingworth
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
exactly
;
that
is
,
you
intend
to
do
so
,
I
know
,
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
by
that
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
Chillingworth
;
"
you
be
a
complete
riddle
to
-
night
,
Jack
;
what
be
the
matter
with
you

you

"
very

doctor

leave

here

if

there
be
not
two
hundred
yard
now

you

Doctor
Chillingworth

who
stand
wipe
his
forehead
,
whilst
the
picture
be
stand
up
against
the
pole
.
 
<EOS>

do
you
want
a
hand
up
first

<EOS>
"
no
,
thank
you
;
I
can
get
it
up
very
well
without
any
trouble
--
it
be
not
so
heavy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
good
bye
,
then
,
"
say
Jack
;
and
,
in
a
few
moment
more
,
Jack
Pringle
be
out
of
sight
,
and
the
doctor
be
alone
with
the
ominous
picture
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
far
to
go
,
and
be
within
hail
of
the
cottage
;
but
it
be
late
,
and
yet
he
believe
he
should
find
them
up
,
for
the
quietude
and
calmness
of
the
evening
hour
<EOS>
be
that
which
most
chime
with
their
feeling
.
<EOS>
at
such
a
time
they
could
look
out
upon
the
face
of
nature
,
and
the
freedom
of
thought
appear
the
great
,
because
there
be
no
human
being
to
clash
with
the
silence
and
stillness
of
the
scene
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
mutter
Chillingworth
,
"
I
will
go
at
once
to
the
cottage
with
my
burthen
.
<EOS>
how
they
will
look
at
me
,
and
wonder
what
could
induce
me
to
bring
this
away
.
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
help
smile
at
the
thought
of
how
they
will
look
at
the
apparition
I
shall
make
.
"
 
<EOS>
thus
fill
with
notion
that
appear
to
please
him
,
the
doctor
shoulder
the
picture
,
and
walk
slowly
along
until
he
reach
the
dead
wall
that
run
up
to
the
entrance
,
or
nearly
so
,
of
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
plantation
of
young
tree
that
overhang
the
path
,
and
cast
a
deep
shadow
below
--
a
pleasant
spot
in
hot
weather
.
 
<EOS>
the
doctor
have
be
carry
the
picture
,
rest
the
side
of
it
on
the
small
of
his
arm
,
and
against
his
shoulder
;
but
this
be
an
inconvenient
posture
,
because
the
weight
of
the
picture
cut
his
arm
so
much
,
that
he
be
compel
to
pause
,
and
shift
it
more
on
his
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
,
"
he
mutter
,
"
that
will
do
for
the
present
,
and
last
until
I
reach
the
cottage
garden
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
be
proceed
along
at
a
slow
and
steady
pace
,
bestow
all
his
care
and
attention
to
the
manner
of
hold
the
picture
,
when
he
be
suddenly
paralyse
by
the
sound
of
a
great
shout
of
such
a
peculiar
character
,
that
he
involuntarily
stop
,
and
the
next
moment
,
something
heavy
come
against
him
with
great
force
,
just
as
if
a
man
have
jump
from
the
wall
on
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
truth
,
for
,
in
another
moment
,
and
before
he
could
recover
himself
,
he
find
that
there
be
an
attempt
to
deprive
him
of
the
picture
.
 
<EOS>
this
at
once
arouse
him
,
and
he
make
an
instant
and
a
vigorous
defence
;
but
he
be
compel
to
let
go
his
hold
of
the
picture
,
and
turn
to
resist
the
infuriate
attack
that
be
now
commence
upon
himself
.
 
<EOS>
for
some
moment
it
be
doubtful
who
would
be
the
victor
;
but
the
wind
and
strength
of
the
doctor
be
not
enough
to
resist
the
powerful
adversary
against
whom
he
have
to
contend
,
and
the
heavy
blow
that
be
shower
down
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
he
be
enable
to
bear
up
against
this
attack
;
and
then
he
return
many
of
the
blow
with
interest
;
but
the
stunning
effect
of
the
blow
he
receive
himself
,
be
such
that
he
could
not
help
himself
,
and
feel
his
sense
gradually
fail
,
his
strength
become
less
and
less
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
short
time
,
he
receive
such
a
blow
,
that
he
be
lay
senseless
on
the
earth
in
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
how
long
he
remain
thus
he
could
not
say
;
but
it
could
not
have
be
long
,
for
all
around
him
seem
just
as
it
be
before
he
be
attack
.
 
<EOS>
the
moon
have
scarcely
move
,
and
the
shadow
,
such
as
they
be
,
be
fall
in
the
same
direction
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
be
long
here
,
"
he
mutter
,
after
a
few
moment
'
reflection
;
"
but
--
but--
"
 
<EOS>
He
stop
short
;
for
,
on
look
around
him
,
he
see
the
object
of
his
solicitude
be
go
.
<EOS>
the
picture
be
nowhere
to
be
see
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
carry
off
the
instant
he
have
be
vanquish
.
 
<EOS>
"
go
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
in
a
low
,
disconsolate
tone
;
"
and
after
all
I
have
do
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
wipe
his
hand
across
his
brow
,
and
find
it
cut
,
he
look
at
the
back
of
his
hand
,
and
see
by
the
deep
colour
that
it
be
blood
,
indeed
,
he
could
now
feel
it
trickle
down
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
what
to
do
he
hardly
know
;
he
could
stand
,
and
after
have
get
upon
his
foot
,
he
stagger
back
against
the
wall
,
against
which
he
lean
for
support
,
and
afterwards
he
creep
along
with
the
aid
of
its
support
,
until
he
come
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
observe
from
the
window
,
where
Henry
and
Charles
Holland
,
see
him
come
up
with
such
an
unsteady
gait
,
rush
to
the
door
to
ascertain
what
be
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
"
what

doctor
!
<EOS>
"
exclaim
Henry
Bannerworth
;
"
what
be
the
matter
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
almost
dead
,
I
think
,
"
say
Chillingworth
.
<EOS>
"
lend
me
your
arm

Henry

"
 
<EOS>
Henry
and
Charles
Holland
immediately
step
out
,
and
take
him
between
them
into
the
parlour
,
and
place
him
upon
a
couch
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
on
earth

into
disgrace
with
the
populace

<EOS>
"

"

the

low
work

"
say
the
admiral
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
doctor
take
no
notice
of
the
inquiry
;
but
eagerly
sip
the
content
of
a
glass
that
Charles
Holland
have
pour
out
of
a
bottle
contain
some
strong
holland
,
and
which
appear
to

<EOS>
"
let
him

find
nobody

nothing
there

suddenly
a
man
step
out
from
behind
the
picture
,
and
we
have
a
fight
over
it
;
after
which
,
just
as
I
be
get
the
bad
of
it

Jack

come
in

yes

"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
Jack
be
a
good
man
,
"
say
the
admiral
;
"
there
may
be
bad
,
at
least
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
we
have
a
desperate
encounter
for
some
minute

during
which
this
fellow

off

"
 
<EOS>
"
carry
off
the

"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
we
have
a
struggle
for
that
;

we
could
not

so
violent

break
away

clear
off

with

no

he
leave
the

<EOS>
well
,
we
be
very
tired
and
bruise
,
and
we
sit
down
to
recover
ourselves
from
our
fatigue
,
and
to
consider
what
be
good
to
be
do
;
but
we
be
some
time
before
we
could
leave
,
and
then
we
determine
that
we
would
take
the
picture
away
with
us
,
as
it
seem
to
be
covet
by
the
robber

for

be
tired

sore

<EOS>
well
,
we
bring
the
picture
out
,

Jack
help
me

within
a
couple
of
hundred

"
the
lubber

the
admiral
,
interjectionally
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
rest
awhile
,
and
then
take
the
picture
on
my
shoulder
,
I
proceed
along
with
it
until
I
come
to
the
wall
,
when
suddenly
I
hear
a
great
shout
,
and
then
down
come
something
heavy
upon
me
,
just
as
if

man
have
jump
down
upon
me

<EOS>
"

--

"
 
"
yes

the
doctor
,
"
it
was--
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
what
?
"
inquire
the
admiral
.
 
<EOS>
"
just
what
you
all
seem
to
anticipate
;
you
be
all
before
me

that
be
it

"
a
man
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
have
a
struggle
with
him
,

get
nearly
kill
,
for
I
be
not
equal

him
in
strength

<EOS>
I
be
sadly
knock
about
,
and
finally
all
the
sense
be
knock
out
of
me

I
be
,
I

leave
for
dead

what
become
of
the
picture
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
;
but
I
suppose
it
be
take
away
,
as
,
when
I
come
to
myself
,
it
be
go
;
indeed
,
I
have
some
faint
recollection
of
see
him
seize
the
portrait
as
I
be
fall
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
pause
of
some
moment
,
during
which
all
the
party
appear
to
be
employ
with
their
own
thought
,
and
the
whole
be
silent

<EOS>
"
do
you
think
it
be
the
same
man
who
attack
you
in
the
house
that
obtain
the
picture
?
"
<EOS>
at
last
inquire
Henry
Bannerworth
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
,
but
I
think
it
most
probable
that
it
be
the
same
;
indeed
,
the
general
appearance
,
as
near
as
I
could
tell
in
the
dark
,
be
the
same
;
but
what
I
look
upon
as
much
strong
be
,
the
object
appear
to
be
the
same
in
both
case
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
very
true
,
"
say
Henry
Bannerworth--"very
true
;
and
I
think
it
more
than
probable
myself

<EOS>
but
come
,
doctor
,
you
will
require
rest
and
nursing
after
your
danger

<EOS>
there
be
some
peculiar
circumstance
why
Anderbury
-
on
-
the
-
Mount
be
to
let
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
for
a
great
number
of
year
in
possession
of
a
family
of
the
name
of
Milltown
,
who
have
reside
there
in
great
comfort
and
respectability
,
until
an
epidemic
disorder
break
out
,
first
among
the
servant
,
and
then
spread
to
the
junior
branch
of
the
family
,
and
from
them
to
their
senior
,
produce
such
devastation
,
that
in
the
course
of
three
week
there
be
but
one
young
man
leave
of
the
whole
family
,
and
he
,
by
native
vigour
of
constitution
,
have
baffle
the
disorder
,
and
find
himself
alone
in
his
ancestral
hall
,
the
last
of
his
race
.
 
<EOS>
soon
a
settle
melancholy
take
possession
of
him
,
and
all
that
have
formerly
delight
him
now
give
him
pain
,
inasmuch
as
it
bring
to
his
mind
a
host
of
recollection
of
the
most
agonising
character
.
 
<EOS>
in
vain
be
it
that
the
surround
gentry
pay
him
every
possible
attention
,
and
endeavour
to
do
all
that
be
in
their
power
to
alleviate
the
unhappy
circumstance
in
which
he
be
place
.
<EOS>
if
he
smile
,
it
be
in
a
sad
sort
,
and
that
be
very
seldom
;
and
at
length
he
announce
his
intention
of
leave
the
neighbourhood
,
and
seek
abroad
,
and
in
change
of
scene
,
for
that
solace
which
he
could
not
expect
to
find
in
his
ancestral
home
,
after
what
have
occur
within
its
ancient
wall
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
chamber
but
which
remind
him
of
the
past
--
there
be
not
a
tree
or
a
plant
of
any
kind
or
description
but
which
speak
to
him
plainly
of
those
who
be
now
no
more
,
and
whose
merry
laughter
have
within
his
own
memory
make
that
ancient
place
echo
with
glee
,
fill
the
sunny
air
with
the
most
gladsome
shout
,
such
as
come
from
the
lip
of
happy
youth
long
before
the
world
have
rob
it
of
any
of
its
romance
or
its
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
general
feeling
of
regret
when
this
young
man
announce
the
fact
of
his
departure
to
a
foreign
land
;
for
he
be
much
respected
,
and
the
know
calamity
which
he
have
suffer
,
and
the
grief
under
which
he
labour
,
invest
his
character
with
a
great
and
painful
interest
.
 
<EOS>
an
entertainment
be
give
to
him
upon
the
eve
of
his
departure
,
and
on
the
next
day
he
be
many
mile
from
the
place
,
and
the
estate
of
Anderbury
-
on
-
the
-
Mount
be
understand
to
be
sell
or
let
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
mansion
have
remain
,
then
,
for
a
year
or
two
vacant
,
for
it
be
a
place
of
too
much
magnitude
,
and
require
by
far
too
expensive
an
establishment
to
keep
it
go
,
to
enable
any
person
whose
mean
be
not
very
large
to
think
of
have
anything
to
do
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
therefore
,
it
remain
unlet
,
and
wear
that
gloomy
aspect
which
a
large
house
,
untenanted
,
so
very
quickly
assume
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
quite
a
melancholy
thing
to
look
upon
it
,
and
to
think
what
it
must
have
once
be
,
and
what
it
may
be
still
,
compare
to
what
it
actually
be
;
and
the
inhabitant
of
the
neighbourhood
have
make
up
their
mind
that
Anderbury
-
on
-
the
-
Mount
would
remain
untenanted
for
many
a
year
to
come
,
and
,
perhaps
,
ultimately
fall
into
ruin
and
decay
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
this
they
be
doom
to
be
disappoint
,
for
,
on
the
evening
of
a
dull
and
gloomy
day
,
about
one
week
after
the
event
we
have
record
as
take
place
at
Bannerworth
Hall
and
its
immediate
neighbourhood
,
a
travel
carriage
,
with
four
horse
and
an
out
-
rider
,
come
dash
into
the
place
,
and
draw
up
at
the
principal
inn
in
the
town
,
which
be
call
the
Anderbury
Arms
.
 
<EOS>
the
appearance
of
such
an
equipage
,
although
not
the
most
unusual
thing
in
the
world
,
in
consequence
of
the
many
aristocratic
family
who
reside
in
the
neighbourhood
,
cause
,
at
all
event
,
some
sensation
,
and
,
perhaps
,
the
more
so
because
it
drive
up
to
the
inn
instead
of
to
any
of
the
mansion
of
the
neighbourhood
,
thereby
show
that
the
stranger
,
whoever
he
be
,
come
not
as
a
visitor
,
but
either
merely
bait
in
the
town
,
be
on
his
road
somewhere
else
,
or
have
some
special
business
in
it
which
would
soon
be
learn
.
 
<EOS>
the
out
-
rider
,
who
be
in
handsome
livery
,
have
galloppe
on
in
advance
of
the
carriage
a
short
distance
,
for
the
purpose
of
order
the
good
apartment
in
the
inn
to
be
immediately
prepared
for
the
reception
of
his
master
.
 
<EOS>
"
who
be
he
?
"
ask
the
landlord
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
Baron
Stolmuyer
Saltsburgh
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
bless
my
heart
,
I
never
hear
of
him
before
;
where
do
he
come
from
--
somewhere
abroad
<EOS>
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
you
anything
of
him
further
than
that
he
be
immensely
rich
,
and
be
look
for
a
house
.
<EOS>
He
have
hear
that
there
be
one
to
let
in
this
immediate
neighbourhood
,
and
that
be
what
have
bring
him
from
London
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
there
be
one
;
and
it
be
call
Anderbury
-
on
-
the
-
Mount
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
he
will
very
likely
speak
to
you
about
it
himself
,
for
here
he
come
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
the
carriage
have
halt
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
,
and
,
the
door
be
open
,
and
the
step
lower
,
there
alight
from
it
a
tall
man
attire
in
a
kind
of
pelisse
,
or
cloak
,
trim
with
rich
fur
,
the
body
of
it
be
compose
of
velvet
.
<EOS>
upon
his
head
he
wear
a
travel
cap
,
and
his
finger
,
as
he
grasp
the
cloak
around
him
,
be
see
to
be
cover
with
ring
of
great
value
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
personage
,
come
in
such
style
,
be
,
of
course
,
likely
to
be
honour
in
every
possible
way
by
the
landlord
of
the
inn
,
and
accordingly
he
be
show
most
obsequiously
to
the
handsome
apartment
in
the
house
,
and
the
whole
establishment
be
put
upon
the
alert
to
attend
to
any
order
he
may
choose
to
give
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
long
in
the
place
when
he
send
for
the
landlord
,
who
,
hastily
scramble
on
his
good
coat
,
and
get
his
wife
to
arrange
the
tie
of
his
neckcloth
,
proceed
to
obey
the
order
of
his
illustrious
guest
,
whatever
they
may
chance
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
find
the
Baron
Stolmuyer
recline
upon
a
sofa
,
and
have
throw
aside
his
velvet
cloak
,
trim
with
rich
fur
,
he
show
that
underneath
it
<EOS>
he
wear
a
costume
of
great
richness
and
beauty
,
although
,
certainly
,
the
form
it
cover
be
not
calculate
to
set
it
off
to
any
great
advantage
,
for
the
baron
be
merely
skin
and
bone
,
and
look
like
a
man
who
have
just
emerge
from
a
long
illness
,
for
his
face
be
ghastly
pale
,
and
the
landlord
could
not
help
observe
that
there
be
a
strange
peculiarity
about
his
eye
,
the
reason
of
which
he
could
not
make
out
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
the
landlord
of
this
inn
,
I
presume
,
"
say
the
baron
,
"
and
,
consequently
,
no
doubt
well
acquaint
with
the
neighbourhood
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
the
honour
to
be
all
that
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
here
about
sixteen
year
,
and
in
that
time
I
certainly
ought
to
know
something
of
the
neighbourhood
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
well
;
some
one
tell
me
there
be
a
little
cottage
sort
of
place
to
let
here
,
and
as
I
be
simple
and
retire
in
my
habit
<EOS>
I
think
that
it
may
possibly
suit
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
little
cottage
,
sir
!
<EOS>
there
be
certainly
little
cottage
to
let
,
but
not
such
as
would
suit
you
;
and
if
I
may
have
presume
,
sir
,
to
think
,
I
should
have
consider
Anderbury
-
on
-
the
-
Mount
,
which
be
now
to
let
,
would
have
be
the
place
for
you

<EOS>
It
be
a
large
place
,
sir

and
belong
to
a
good
family
,
although
they
be
now
all
dead
and
go
,
except
one
,
and
it
be
he
who
want
to
let
the
old
place
.

"
 
<EOS>
"
Anderbury
-
on
-
the
-
Mount

"
say
the
baron
,
"
be
the
name
of
the
place
mention
to
me
;
but
I
understand
it
be
a
little
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
sir
,
that
be
quite
a
mistake
;
who
tell
you
so
?
<EOS>
It
be
the
large
place
about
here
;
there
be
a
matter
of
twenty
-
seven
room
in
it
,
and
it
stand
altogether
upon
three
hundred
acre
of
ground
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
have
you
the
assurance
,
"
say
the
baron
,
"
to
call
that
anything
but
a
cottage
,
when
the
castle
of
the
Stolmuyers
,
at
Saltzburgh
,
have
one
suite
of
reception
room
thirty
in
number
,
open
into
each

the
total
number

two
hundred

sixty

by
eight
mile

"
 
<EOS>
"
the
devil
!
"
say
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
but
when
I
be
astonished
,
I
generally
say
the
devil
.

They
want
eight
hundred
pound
a
year
for
Anderbury

on

the
-
Mount

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
mere
trifle

<EOS>
I
will
sleep
here
to
-
night
,
and
in
the
morning
I
will
go
and
look
at
the
place
.
<EOS>
It
be
near
the
sea
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
half
a
mile
,
sir
,
exactly
,
from
the
beach
;
and
one
of
the
most
curious
circumstance
of
all
connect
with
it
be
,
that
there
be
a
subterranean
passage
from
the
ground
lead
right
away
down
to
the
sea
-
coast
.
<EOS>
a
most
curious
place
,
sir
,
partly
cut
out
of
the
cliff
,
with
cellar
in
it
for
wine
,
and
other
matter
,
that
in
the
height
of
summer
be
keep
as
cool
as
in
the
deep
winter
time
.
<EOS>
It
be
more
for
curiosity
than
use
,
such
a
place
;
and
the
old
couple
,
that
now
take
care
of
the
house
,
make
a
pretty
penny
,
I
will
be
bind
,
though
they
will
not
own
it
,
by
show
that
part
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
suit
me
,
but
I
shall
be
able
to
give
a
decisive
answer
when
I
see
it
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
You
will
let
my
attendant
have
what
they
require
,
and
see
that
my
horse
be
well
look
to
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
oh
!
<EOS>
certainly
,
sir
,
of
course
;
you
may
go
far
,
indeed
,
sir
,
before
you
find
an
inn
where
everything
would
be
do
as
thing
be
do
here
.
<EOS>
be
there
anything
in
particular
,
sir
,
you
would
like
for
dinner
?

<EOS>
"
how
can
I
tell
that
,
idiot
,
until
the
dinner
time
arrive
?

<EOS>

well

,
sir

in
that
case

you
know

we
scarcely
know
what
to
do
,
because
you
see

you
understand--
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
strange
to
me
that
you

neither

understand
your
duty

<EOS>
I
be
accustomed
to
have
the
dinner
table
spread
with
all
that
money
can
procure

then
I
choose

not
before

what
it

me

partake
of

Wil
,
sir

that
be
a
very
good
way

perhaps
we
be
not

so
used
to
that
sort
of
thing

be

part

another

that
we
shall
have
you
in

a
long
time

so

put
one
thing
to
another

draw
a
conclusion
from
both
of

"
 
<EOS>
the
baron
speak
these
word
so
furiously
,
that
the
landlord
be
rather
terrified
than
otherwise
,
and
leave
the
room
hastily
,
mutter
to
himself
that
he
have
never
come
across
such
a
tiger
,
and
wonder
where
the
baron
could
have
possibly
come
from
,
and
what
amount
of
wealth
he
could
be
possess
of
,
that
would
enable
him
to
live
in
such
a
princely
style
as
he
mention

if
the
Baron
Stolmuyer
of
Saltzburgh
have
wish
ever
so
much
to
impress
upon
the
mind
of
all
person
in
the
neighbourhood
the
fact
of
his
wealth
and
importance
,
he
could
not
have
adopt
a
well
plan
to
accomplish
that
object
than
by
first
of
all
impress
such
fact
upon
the
mind
of
the
landlord
of
the
Anderbury
Arms
,
for
in
the
course
of
another
hour
<EOS>
it
be
tolerably
well
spread
all
over
the
town
,
that
never
have
there
be
such
a
guest
at
the
Anderbury
Arms
;
and
that
he
call
Anderbury
-
on
-
the
-
Mount
,
with
all
its
room
--
all
its
outbuilding
,
and
its
three
hundred
acre
of
ground
,
a
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
this
news
spread
like
wildfire
,
awake
no
end
of
speculation
,
and
give
rise
to
the
most
exaggerated
rumour
,
so
that
a
number
of
person
come
to
the
inn
on
purpose
to
endeavour
to
get
a
look
at
the
baron
;
but
he
do
not
stir
from
his
apartment
,
so
that
these
wondermonger
be
disappoint
,
and
even
force
to
go
away
as
wise
as
they
come
;
but
in
the
majority
of
case
they
make
up
their
mind
that
in
the
morning
they
should
surely
be
able
to
obtain
a
glimpse
of
him
,
which
be
consider
a
great
treat
,
for
a
man
with
an
immense
income
be
look
upon
in
England
as
a
natural
curiosity
.
 
<EOS>
the
landlord
take
his
guest
at
his
word
as
regard
the
dinner
,
and
provide
such
a
repast
as
seldom
,
indeed
,
grace
the
board
at
the
Anderbury
Arms
--
a
repast
sufficient
for
twenty
people
,
and
certainly
which
be
a
monstrous
thing
to
set
before
one
individual
.
 
<EOS>
the
baron
,
however
,
make
no
remark
,
but
select
a
portion
from
some
of
the
dish
,
and
those
dish
that
he
do
select
from
,
be
of
the
simple
kind
,
and
not
such
as
the
landlord
expect
him
to
take
,
so
that
he
really
pay
about
one
hundred
time
the
amount
he
ought
to
have
do
for
what
actually
pass
his
lip
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
what
a
fidget
the
landlord
be
in
about
his
wine
,
for
he
doubt
not
but
such
a
guest
would
be
extremely
critical
and
hard
to
please
;
<EOS>
but
,
to
his
great
relief
,
the
baron
decline
take
any
wine
,
merely
wash
down
his
repast
with
a
tumbler
of
cool
water
;
and
then
,
although
the
hour
be
very
early
,
he
retire
at
once
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
the
landlord
be
not
dispose
to
disregard
the
injunction
which
the
baron
have
give
him
to
attend
carefully
on
his
servant
and
horse
,
and
after
give
order
that
nothing
should
be
stint
as
regard
the
latter
,
he
himself
look
to
the
creature
-
comfort
of
the
former
,
and
he
do
this
with
a
double
motive
,
for
not
only
<EOS>
be
he
anxious
to
make
the
most
he
could
out
of
the
baron
in
the
way
of
charge
,
but
he
be
positively
pant
with
curiosity
to
know
more
about
so
singular
a
personage
,
and
he
think
that
surely
the
servant
must
be
able
to
furnish
him
with
some
particular
regard
their
eccentric
master
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
,
however
,
he
be
mistaken
,
for
although
they
tell
him
all
they
know
,
that
amount
to
so
little
as
really
not
to
be
worth
the
learning
.
 
<EOS>
They
inform
him
that
they
have
be
engage
all
in
the
last
week
,
and
that
they
know
nothing
of
the
baron
whatever
,
or
where
he
come
from
,
or
what
he
be
,
except
that
he
pay
them
most
liberal
wage
,
and
be
not
very
exact
in
the
service
he
require
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
very
unsatisfactory
,
and
when
the
landlord
start
on
a
mission
,
which
he
consider
himself
bind
to
perform
,
to
a
Mr.
Leek
,
in
the
town
,
who
have
the
letting
of
Anderbury
-
on
-
the
-
Mount
,
he
be
quite
vexed
to
think
what
a
small
amount
of
information
he
be
able
to
carry
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
tell
him
,
"
he
say
to
himself
as
he
go
quickly
towards
the
agent
's
residence
;
"
I
can
tell
him
the
baron
's
name
,
and
that
in
the
morning
he
want
to
look
at
Anderbury
-
on
-
the
-
Mount
;
but
that
be
all
I
know
of
him
,
except
that
he
be
a
most
extraordinary
man
--
indeed
,
the
most
extraordinary
that
I
ever
come
near
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Leek
,
the
house
agent
,
notwithstanding
the
deficiency
of
the
fact
contain
in
the
landlord
's
statement
,
be
well
enough
satisfied
to
hear
that
any
one
of
apparent
wealth
be
inquire
after
the
large
premise
to
let

for
,
as
he
say
truly
to
the
landlord,--
 
<EOS>
"
the
commission
on

of
such
a

be
no

to
me
.

<EOS>

precisely

"
say
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
well
to
come
and
tell
you
at
once
,
for
there
can
be
no

that

be
enormously
rich

if
that

satisfactorily
prove
,
it
be
of
no
consequence
what
he
be
,
or
who
he
be
,
and
you
may
depend
I
shall
be
round
to
the
inn
early
in
the
morning
to
attend
upon
him
;
and
in
that
case
,
perhaps
,
if
you
have
any
conversation
with
him
,
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
mention
that
I
will
show
him
over
the
premise
at
his
own
hour

you
shall
not

<EOS>
,
you
may
depend
,
if
any
arrangement
be
actually
come
to
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
just
as
well
for
you
to
tell
him
what
a
nice
property
it
be
,
and
that
it
be
to
be
let
for
eight
hundred
a
year
,
or
sell
outright
for
eight
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
you
may
depend
,
Mr.
Leek
.
<EOS>
a
most
extraordinary
man
you
will
find
him
;
not
the
handsome
in
the
world
,
I
can
tell
you
,
but
handsome
be
as
handsome
<EOS>
do
,
say
I
;
and
,
if
he
take
Anderbury
-
on
-
the
-
Mount
,
I
have
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
he
will
spend
a
lot
of
money
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
we
shall
all
be
the
well
of
that
,
of
course
,
as
you
well
know

sir

"
 
<EOS>
this
then
be
thoroughly
agree
upon
between
these
high
contracting
power
,
and
the
landlord
return
home
very
well
satisfied
,
indeed
,
with
the
position
in
which
he
have
put
the
affair
,
and
resolve
upon
urge
on
the
baron
,
as
far
as
it
lie
within
his
power
so
to
do
,
to
establish
himself
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
to
allow
him
to
be
purveyor
-
in

general
to
his
household
,
which
,
if
the

continue
in

a
very
pleasant

the

PASSAGE

[

about
an
hour
and
a
half
after
the
baron
have
retire
to
rest
,
and
while
the
landlord
be
still
creep
about
enjoin
silence
on
the
part
of
the
establishment
,
so
that
the
slumber
of
a
wealthy
and
,
no
doubt
,
illustrious
personage
should
not
be
disturb
,
there
arrive
a
horseman
at
the
Anderbury
Arms
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
rather
a
singular
-
looking
man
,
with
a
shifting
,
uneasy
-
look
glance
,
as
if
he
be
afraid
of
be
suddenly
pounce
upon
and
surprise
by
some
one
;
and
although
his
apparel
be
plain
,
yet
it
be
good
in
quality
,
and
his
whole
appearance
be
such
as
to
induce
respectful
attention
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
singular
circumstance
be
,
that
such
a
traveller
,
so
well
mounted
,
should
be
alone
;
but
that
may
have
be
his
own
fancy
,
so
that
the
absence
of
an
attendant
go
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
doubtless
,
if
the
whole
inn
have
not
be
in
such
a
commotion
about
the
illustrious
and
wealthy
baron
,
this
stranger
would
have
receive
more
consideration
and
attention
than
he
do
.
 
<EOS>
upon
alighting
,
he
walk
at
once
into
what
be
call
the
coffee
-
room
of
the
hotel
,
and
after
order
some
refreshment
,
of
which
he
partake
but
<EOS>
sparingly
,
he
say
,
in
a
mild
but
solemn
sort
of
tone
,
to
the
waiter
who
attend
upon
him,--
 
<EOS>
"
tell
the
Baron
Stolmuyer
,
of
Saltzburgh
,
that
there
be
one
here
who
want
to
see
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
"
say
the
waiter
,
"
but
the
baron
be
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
matter
not
to
me
.
<EOS>
if
you
nor
no
one
else
in
this
establishment
will
deliver
the
message
I
charge
you
with
,
I
must
do
so
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
speak
to
my
master
,
sir
;
but
the
baron
be
a
very
great
gentleman
indeed
,
and
I
do
not
think
my
master
would
like
to
have
him
disturb
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
stranger
hesitate
for
a
time
,
and
then
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
show
me
the
baron
's
apartment
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
ought
not
to
ask
any
one
person
connect
with
this
establishment
to
disturb
him
,
when
I
be
quite
willing
to
do
so
myself
.
<EOS>
show
me
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
but
,
sir
,
the
baron
may
get
in
a
rage
,
and
say
,
very
naturally
,
that
we
have
no
business
to
let
anybody
walk
up
to
his
room
and
disturb
him
,
because
we
would
not
do
so
ourselves
.
<EOS>
so
that
you
see
,
sir
,
when
you
come
to
consider
,
it
hardly
seem
the
right
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
since
,
"
say
the
stranger
,
rise
,
"
I
can
not
procure
even
the
common
courtesy
of
be
show
to
the
apartment
of
the
person
whom
I
seek
,
I
must
find
him
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
he
speak
he
walk
out
of
the
room
,
and
begin
ascend
the
staircase
,
despite
the
remonstrance
of
the
waiter
,
who
call
after
him
repeatedly
,
but
could
not
induce
him
to
stop
;
and
when
he
find
that
such
be
the
case
,
he
make
his
way
to
the
landlord
,
to
give
the
alarm
that
,
for
all
he
know
to
the
contrary
,
some
one
have
go
up
stair
to
murder
the
baron
.
 
<EOS>
this
information
throw
the
landlord
into
such
a
fix
,
that
he
know
not
what
to
be
at
.
<EOS>
at
one
moment
he
be
for
rush
up
stair
and
endeavour
to
interfere
,
and
at
another
he
think
the
good
plan
would
be
to
pretend
that
he
know
nothing
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
while
he
be
in
this
state
of
uncertainty
,
the
stranger
succeed
in
make
his
way
up
stair
to
the
floor
from
which
proceed
the
bedroom
,
and
,
apparently
,
have
no
fear
whatever
of
the
Baron
Stolmuyer
's
indignation
before
his
eye
,
he
open
door
after
door
,
until
he
come
to
one
which
lead
him
into
the
apartment
occupy
by
that
illustrious
individual
.
 
<EOS>
the
baron
,
half
undressed
only
,
lie
in
an
uneasy
slumber
upon
the
bed
,
and
the
stranger
stand
opposite
to
him
for
some
minute
,
as
if
consider
what
he
should
do
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
easy
,
"
he
say
,
"
to
kill
him
;
but
it
will
pay
me
well
to
spare
him
.
<EOS>
I
may
be
wrong
in
supposing
that
he
have
the
mean
which
I
hope
he
have
;
but
that
I
shall
soon
discover
by
his
conversation
.
"
 
<EOS>
stretch
out
,
his
hand
,
he
tap
the
baron
lightly
on
the
shoulder

who
thereupon
open
his
eye

spring
to
his

instantly

glance
with
fix
earnestness
at
the
intruder

upon
whose
face
shine
the
light
of
a
lamp

in

<EOS>
then
the
baron
shrink
back
,
and
the
stranger
,
fold
his
arm
,
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
You
know

<EOS>
let
our
interview
be

brief

there

we
both
know
all
that

from
your
style
of
living

they
must
be
great

therefore
it
be
that
I
make
no
hesitation
in
ask
of
you
,
as
a
price
for
not
expose
who
and
what
you

a
moderate

you

it

not

the
first
opportunity

I
can
give
you
no
such
assurance

perhaps
,
that
would
satisfy
you
entirely

,
for
more
reason
than
I
choose
to
enter
into

I
be
extremely
anxious

England
at

scrutinizingly

the
two

down
,

amicably

it

a
great
relief

the
landlord

forward

open
the
door

for
which
piece
of
service
he
get
a
very
stately
bow
from
the
baron

a
slight
inclination
of
the
head
from
his
visitor
,

they
both
pass
out
.

I

this

idle
talk
indeed

most
idle
;

there
be
certain
circumstance
which
account
for
the
strange
phenomenon

what
roaring
sound
be
that
which
come
so
regularly

steadily
upon

ear

It
be
the
sea
washing
upon

tide

advance

,
as
the
eddy
surge
roll
in
upon

pebbly
shore

they
make
what

to
my

be
this
pleasant
music

us
walk
upon
the
beach

as
that
sound
be
such
pleasant
music

you
shall
hear
it
while
I
convince
you
what
unpleasant
consequence
will
arise
from
a
refusal

the
modest
and
moderate
term
I
offer
you

<EOS>

We
shall
see
,
we
shall
see

I
must
confess
it
do
seem
to
me
most
extraordinary
that
you
ask
of
me
a
positive
fortune
,
for
fear
you
should
deprive

<EOS>
"
 
while
they
be
talk
they
reach
a
long
strip
of
sand
which
be
by
the
seashore
,
at
the
base
of
some
cliff
,
through
which
be
excavate
the
passage
from
the
coast
into
the
ground
of
Anderbury
House

which
have
be
so
expatiate
upon
by
the
landlord
of
the
inn
,
in
his
description
of
the
advantage
attendant
upon
that
property

<EOS>
there
be
some
rude
step
,
lead
to
a
narrow
arched
door
-
way
,
which
constitute
an
entrance
to
this
subterraneous
region
;
and
as
the
moonlight
stream
over
the
wide
waste
of
water
,
and
fall
upon
this
little
door
-
way
in
the
face
of
the
cliff
,
he
become
convinced
that
it
be
the
entrance
to
that
excavation
,

he
eye
it
curiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
place
be
that
?
"
say
his
companion
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
private
entrance

the
ground

<EOS>
"
private
enough
,
I
should
presume
;

if
there
be
any
other
mean

reach
the

surely
no
one
would
go
through
such
a
dismal
hole

that
towards
it

come

make
up
your

at

<EOS>
there
need
be
no

It
be
worth
my

not
at

that
you
mention

I
can

accomplish

itself
very

my

well
the

now
I

give

I

to
commit
myself

indeed

do
you

you
bear
such
a
charm
life

nothing
can
shake
it

I

nothing

I
know
what
I

I

armed

I
;

take
the

you

make
me
what
I

would
now
seek
to
destroy
my
every

satisfaction

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
as
the
baron
speak
he
draw
from
his
breast
a
small
pistol
,
which
,
with
the
quickness
of
thought
,
he
hold
full
in
the
face
of
his
companion

pull
the
trigger

<EOS>
there
can
be
no
doubt
on
earth
that
his
intention
be
to
commit
the
murder

the
pistol
miss
fire
,

he
be
defeat
in
his
intention
at
that
moment

<EOS>
then
the
stranger
laugh
scornfully
,
and
draw
a
pistol
from
his
pocket
,
he
present
it
at
the

head
,
saying,--
 
<EOS>

I

I

escape
death

<EOS>
no

I
could
not
;
but
you
perceive
that
even
a
weapon
that
may
not
fail
you
upon
another
occasion
be
harmless
against
me

can
you
expect

take
full

ample
revenge
upon

dastardly
attempt

"
 
<EOS>
these
word
be
speak
with
great
volubility
,
so
much
so
,
indeed
,
that
they
only
occupy
a
few
very
brief
second
in
deliver
;
and
then
,
perhaps
,
the
baron
's
career
may
have
end
,
for
it
seem
to
be
fully
the
intention
of
the
other
to
conclude
what
he
say
by
fire
the
pistol
in
his
face
;
but
the
wily
aspect
of
the
baron
's
countenance
be
,
after
all
,
but
a
fair
index
of
the
mind
,
and
,
just
as
the
last
word
pass
the
lip
of
his
irritated
companion
,
he
suddenly
drop
in
a
crouch
position
to
the
ground

seize
his
leg
,
throw
him
over
his
head

instant

pistol
be
discharge
,
at
the

moment
,

then
,
with
a
shout
of
rage
and
satisfaction
,
the
baron
spring
upon
his
foe
,
and
,
kneel
upon
his
breast
,
he
hold
aloft
in
his
hand
a
glitter
dagger
,
the
highly
-
polished
blade

which
catch
the
moonbeams

reflect
them
into

away

as
he
speak
the
baron
grind
his
tooth
together
with
rage
,
and
,
in
an
instant
,
bury
the
poniard
in
the
throat
of
his
victim
.
<EOS>
the
blade
go
through
to
the
yellow
sand
beneath

the
murderer
still
knelt
upon
the
man

chest
,
while

who
have
thus
receive
so
fatal
a
blow
toss
his
arm
about
with
agony
,
and
try
in
vain
to
shriek
.
 
<EOS>
the
nature
of
the
wound
,
however
,
prevent
him
from
utter
anything
but
a
low
gurgling
sound
,
for
he
be
nearly
choke
with
his
own
blood
,
and
soon
his
eye
become
fix
and
of
a
glassy
appearance
;
he
stretch
out
his
two
arm

dig
his
finger
deep
into
the
sand
.
 
<EOS>
the
baron
draw
forth
the
poniard
,
and
a
gush
of
blood
immediately
follow
it
,
and
then
one
deep
groan
testify
to
the
fact
,
that
the
spirit
,
if
there
be
a
spirit
,
have
leave
its
mortal
habitation
,
and
wing
its
flight
to
other
realm
,
if
there
be
other
realm
for
it
to
wing
its
flight
to

<EOS>
"
He
be
dead
,
"
say
the
baron
,
and

at
the
same
moment
,
a
roll
of

advance
tide
sweep
over

drench
the
living
,
as
well

dead

the
brine

ocean

stoop
and
rinse
the
dagger
in
the
advance
tide
from
the
clot
blood
which
have
cling
to
it
,
and
then
,
wipe
it
carefully

he
return
it
to
its
sheath

which
be
hide
within
the
fold
of
his
dress

,
rise
from
his
kneel
posture
upon

stand
by

side

with
fold
arm

gaze
upon

for
some
minute
,
in
silence
,
heedless
of
the
still
advance
water
,
which
be
already
considerably
above
his
foot

<EOS>
then
he
speak
in
his
ordinary
accent

evidently
care
nothing

do
such
a
deed

dispose

up

what

rise
again

walk
the
earth

seek
for
vengeance
upon

the
thirst
for
that
vengeance
will
become
such
a
part
of
its
very
nature
,
that
it
will
surely
accomplish
something
,
if
not
all
that
it
desire

"
 
<EOS>
after
a
few
moment
'
consideration
,
he
stoop
,
and
,
with
more
strength
than
one
would
have
think
it
possible
a
man
reduce
almost
,
as
he
be
,
to
a
skeleton
could
have
exert
,
he
lift
the
body
,
and
carry
it
rapidly
up
the
beach
towards
the
cliff
.
<EOS>
He
throw
it
down
upon
the
stone
step
that
lead
to
the
small
door
of
the
excavation
in
the
cliff
,
and
it
fall
upon
them
with
a
sickening
sound
,
as
if
some
of
the
bone
be
surely
break
by
the
fall
.
 
<EOS>
the
object
,
then
,
of
the
baron
seem
to
be
to
get
this
door
open
,
if
he
possibly
could
;
but
that
be
an
object
easy
to
be
desire
than
carry
into
effect
,
for
,
although
he
exert
his
utmost
power
,
he
do
not
succeed
in
move
it
an
inch
,
and
he
begin
evidently
to
think
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
but
yet
he
do
not
give
up
the
attempt
at
once
,
but
look
about
upon
the
beach
,
until
he
find
a
large
heavy
stone
<EOS>
,
he
raise
it
in
his
arm
,
and
,
approach
the
door
,
he
fling
it
against
it
with
such
tremendous
force
,
that
it
fly
open
instantly
,
disclose
within
a
dark
and
narrow
passage
.
 
<EOS>
apparently
rejoice
that
he
have
accomplish
this
much
,
he
stop
cautiously
within
the
entrance
,
and
then
,
take
from
a
conceal
pocket
that
be
in
the
velvet
cloak
which
he
wear
a
little
box
<EOS>
,
he
produce
from
it
some
wax
-
light
and
some
chemical
match
,
which
,
by
the
slight
effort
,
he
succeed
in
igniting
,
and
then
,
with
one
of
the
light
in
his
hand
to
guide
him
on
his
way
,
he
go
on
explore
the
passage
,
and
tread
with
extreme
caution
as
he
go
,
for
fear
of
fall
into
any
of
the
ice
-
well
which
be
report
to
be
in
that
place
.
 
<EOS>
after
proceed
about
twenty
yard
,
and
find
that
there
be
no
danger
,
he
become
less
cautious
;
but
,
in
consequence
of
such
less
caution
,
he
very
nearly
sacrifice
his
life
,
for
he
come
upon
an
ice
-
well
which
seem
a
considerable
depth
,
and
into
which
he
have
nearly
plunge
headlong
.
 
<EOS>
He
start
back
with
some
degree
of
horror
;
but
that
soon
leave
him
,
and
then
,
after
a
moment
's
thought
,
he
seek
for
some
little
nook
in
the
wall
,
in
which
he
may
place
the
candle
,
and
soon
find
one
that
answer
the
purpose
<EOS>
well
,
he
there
leave
it
,
have
all
the
appearance
of
a
little
shrine
,
while
he
proceed
again
to
the
mouth
of
that
singular
and
cavernous
-
looking
place
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
evidently
,
quite
make
up
his
mind
what
to
do
,
for
,
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
he
lift
the
body
again
,
and
carry
it
within
the
entrance
,
walk
boldly
and
firmly
,
now
that
he
know
there
be
no
danger
between
him
and
the
light
,
which
shed
a
gleam
through
the
darkness
of
the
place
of
a
very
faint
and
flickering
character
.
 
<EOS>
He
reach
it
rapidly
,
and
when
he
get
to
the
side
of
the
well
,
he
,
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
fling
it
headlong
down
,
and
,
listen
attentively
<EOS>
,
he
hear
it
fall
with
a
slight
plash
,
as
if
there
be
some
water
at
the
bottom
of
the
pit
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
annoyance
,
however
,
for
him
to
find
that
the
distance
be
not
so
deep
as
he
have
anticipate
,
and
when
he
take
the
light
from
the
niche
where
he
have
place
it
,
and
look
earnestly
down
,
he
could
see
the
livid
,
ghastly
-
looking
face
of
the
dead
man
,
for
the
body
have
accidentally
fall
upon
its
back
,
which
be
a
circumstance
he
have
not
count
upon
,
and
one
which
increase
the
chance
greatly
of
its
be
see
,
should
any
one
be
explore
,
from
curiosity
,
that
not
very
inviting
place
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
annoyance
,
but
how
could
it
be
prevent
,
unless
,
indeed
,
he
choose
to
descend
,
and
make
an
alteration
in
the
disposition
of
the
corpse
?
<EOS>
but
this
be
evidently
what
he
do
not
choose
to
do
;
so
,
after
mutter
to
himself
a
few
word
expressive
of
his
intention
to
leave
it
where
it
be
,
he
replace
the
candle
,
after
extinguish
it
,
in
the
box
from
whence
he
have
take
it
,
and
carefully
walk
out
of
the
dismal
place
.
 
<EOS>
the
moonbeam
be
shine
very
brightly
and
beautifully
upon
the
face
of
the
cliff
,
when
he
emerge
from
the
subterranean
passage
,
so
that
he
could
see
the
door
,
the
step
,
and
every
object
quite
distinctly
;
and
,
to
his
gratification
,
he
find
that
he
have
not
destroy
any
fastening
that
be
to
the
door
,
but
that
when
it
be
slam
shut
,
it
strike
so
hard
and
fast
,
that
the
strength
of
one
man
could
not
possibly
move
it
,
even
the
small
fraction
of
an
inch
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
show
all
this
to
-
morrow
,
"
he
say
;
"
and
if
I
take
this
house
I
must
have
an
alteration
make
in
this
door
,
so
that
it
may
open
with
a
lock
,
instead
of
by
main
violence
,
as
at
present
;
but
if
,
in
the
morning
,
when
I
view
Anderbury
House
,
I
can
avoid
an
entrance
into
this
region
,
I
will
do
so
,
and
at
my
leisure
,
if
I
become
the
possessor
of
the
estate
,
I
can
explore
every
nook
and
cranny
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
fold
his
cloak
about
him
,
after
pull
the
door
as
closely
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
He
walk
slowly
and
thoughtfully
back
to
the
inn
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
evident
that
the
idea
of
the
murder
he
have
commit
do
not
annoy
him
in
the
least
,
and
that
in
his
speculation
upon
the
subject
he
congratulate
himself
much
upon
have
so
far
succeed
in
get
rid
of
certainly
a
most
troublesome
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
well
,
indeed
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
just
at
this
juncture
he
should
throw
himself
in
my
way
,
and
enable
me
so
easy
to
feel
certain
that
I
shall
never
more
be
trouble
with
him
.
<EOS>
truly
,
I
run
some
risk
,
and
when
my
pistol
miss
fire
,
it
seem
as
if
my
evil
star
be
in
its
ascendant
,
and
that
I
be
doom
myself
to
become
the
victim
of
him
whom
I
have
lay
in
so
cold
a
grave
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
be
victorious
,
and
I
be
willing
to
accept
the
circumstance
as
an
oman
of
the
past
--
that
my
fortune
be
on
the
change
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
shall
be
successful
now
,
and
with
the
ample
mean
which
I
now
possess
,
surely
,
in
this
country
,
where
gold
be
love
<EOS>
so
well
,
I
shall
be
able
to
overcome
all
difficulty
,
and
to
unite
myself
to
some
one
,
who
--
but
no
matter
,
her
fate
be
an
after
consideration

CHAPTER
XCV
.
 
<EOS>
the
MARRIAGE
in
the
BANNERWORTH
FAMILY
arranged
.
  
<EOS>
[
illustration
]
 
after
the
adventure
of
the
doctor
with
regard
to
the
picture
about
which
such
an
air
of
mystery
and
interest
have
be
throw
,
the
Bannerworth
family
begin
to
give
up
all
hope
of
ever
find
a
clue
to
those
circumstance
concern
which
they
would
certainly
have
like
to
have
know
the
truth
,
but
of
which
it
be
not
likely
they
would
ever
hear
anything
more
.
 
<EOS>
Dr.
Chillingworth
now
have
no
reserve
,
and
when
he
have
recover
sufficiently
to
feel
that
he
could
converse
without
an
effort
,
he
take
an
opportunity
,
while
the
whole
of
the
family
be
present
,
to
speak
of
what
have
be
his
hope
and
his
expectation
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
all
aware
,
"
he
say
,
"
now
,
of
the
story
of
Marmaduke
Bannerworth
,
and
what
an
excessively
troublesome
person
he
be
,
with
all
deference
,
to
you
,
Henry
;
first
of
all
,
as
to
spend
all
his
money
at
the
gaming
-
table
,
and
leave
his
family
destitute
;
and
then
,
when
he
do
get
a
lump
of
money
which
may
have
do
some
good
to
those
he
leave
behind
him
--
hide
it
somewhere
where
it
could
not
be
find
at
all
,
and
so
leave
you
all
in
great
difficulty
and
distress
,
when
you
may
have
be
independent
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
enough
,
doctor
,
"
say
Henry
;
"
but
you
know
the
old
proverb,--that
ill
-
get
wealth
never
thrive
;
so
that
I
do
not
regret
not
find
this
money
,
for
I
be
sure
we
should
have
be
none
the
happy
with
it
,
and
perhaps
not
so
happy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
bother
the
old
proverb
;
<EOS>
thirty
or
forty
thousand
pound
be
no
trifle
to
be
talk
lightly
of
,
or
the
loss
of
which
to
be
quietly
put
up
with
,
on
account
of
a
musty
proverb
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
large
sum
,
and
I
should
like
to
have
place
it
in
your
hand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
as
you
can
not
,
doctor
,
there
can
be
no
good
possibly
do
by
regret
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
certainly
;
I
do
not
mean
that
;
utter
regret
be
always
a
very
foolish
thing
;
but
it
be
questionable
whether
something
may
not
be
do
in
the
matter
,
after
all
,
for
you
,
as
it
appear
,
by
all
the
evidence
we
can
collect
,
that
it
must
have
be
Varney
,
after
all
,
who
jump
down
upon
me
from
the
garden
-
wall
in
so
sudden
a
manner
:
and
,
if
the
picture
be
valuable
to
him
,
it
must
be
valuable
to
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
how
be
we
to
get
it
,
and
if
we
could
,
I
do
not
see
that
it
would
be
of
much
good
to
anybody
,
for
,
after
all
<EOS>
,
it
be
but
a
painting
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
you
go
again
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
<EOS>
depreciate
what
you
know
nothing
about
;
now
,
listen
to
me
,
Master
Henry
,
and
I
will
tell
you
.
<EOS>
that
picture
evidently
have
some
sort
of
line
at
the
back
,
over
the
original
canvas
;
and
do
you
think
I
would
have
take
such
pain
to
bring
it
away
with
me
if
that
lining
have
not
make
me
suspect
that
between
it
and
the
original
picture
the
money
,
in
bank
note
,
be
deposit
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
have
you
any
special
reason
for
suppose
such
be
the
case
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
most
unquestionably
I
have
;
for
when
I
get
the
picture
fairly
down
,
I
find
various
inequality
in
the
surface
of
the
back
,
which
lead
me
to
believe
that
roll
of
note
be
deposit
,
and
that
the
great
mistake
we
have
all
along
make
be
in
look
behind
the
picture
,
instead
of
at
the
picture
itself
.
<EOS>
I
mean
immediately
to
have
cut
it
to
piece
when
I
reach
here
with
it
;
but
now
it
have
get
into
the
hand
of
somebody
else
,
who
know
,
I
suspect
,
as
much
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
rather
provoking
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
rather
provoking
!
<EOS>
be
that
the
way
to
talk
of
the
loss
of
Heaven
know
how
many
thousand
of
pound
!
<EOS>
I
be
quite
aggravate
myself
at
the
idea
of
the
thing
,
and
it
put
me
in
a
perfect
fever
to
think
of
it
,
I
can
assure
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
what
can
we
do
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
I
propose
an
immediate
crusade
against
Varney
,
the
vampyre
,
for
who
<EOS>
but
he
could
have
make
such
an
attack
upon
me
,
and
force
me
to
deliver
up
such
a
valuable
treasure
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
never
heed
it
,
doctor
,
"
say
Flora
;
"
let
it
go
;
we
have
never
have
or
enjoy
that
money
,
so
it
can
not
matter
,
and
it
be
not
to
be
consider
as
the
loss
of
an
actual
possession
,
because
we
never
do
actually
possess
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
chime
in
the
admiral
;
"
bother
the
money
!
<EOS>
what
do
we
care
about
it
;
and
,
besides
,
Charley
Holland
be
go
to
be
very
busy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
busy
!
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
how
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
be
not
he
go
to
be
marry
directly
to
Flora
,
here
,
and
be
not
I
go
to
settle
the
whole
of
my
property
upon
him
on
condition
that
he
take
the
name
of
Bell
instead
of
Holland
?
<EOS>
for
,
you
see
,
his
mother
be
my
sister
,
and
of
course
her
name
be
Bell
.
<EOS>
as
for
his
father
Holland
,
it
can
not
matter
to
him
now
what
Charley
be
call
;
and
if
he
do
not
take
the
name
of
Bell
<EOS>
I
shall
be
the
last
in
the
family
,
for
I
be
not
likely
to
marry
,
and
have
any
little
bell
about
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
the
doctor
;
"
I
should
say
not
;
and
that
be
the
reason
why
you
want
to
ring
the
change
upon
Charles
Holland
's
name
.
<EOS>
do
you
see
the
joke
,
admiral
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
I
do
<EOS>
--
where
be
it
?
<EOS>
It
be
all
very
well
to
talk
of
joke
,
but
if
I
be
like
Charles
,
go
to
be
marry
,
I
should
not
be
in
any
joking
humour
,
I
can
tell
you
,
but
quite
the
reverse
;
and
as
for
you
and
your
picture
,
if
you
want
it
,
doctor
,
just
run
after
Varney
yourself
for
it
;
or
,
stay
--
<EOS>
I
have
a
well
idea
than
that
--
get
your
wife
to
go
and
ask
him
for
it
,
and
if
she
make
half
such
a
clamour
about
his
ear
that
she
do
about
ours
,
he
will
give
it
her
in
a
minute
,
to
get
rid
of
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
wife!--you
do
not
mean
to
say
she
have
be
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
but
she
have
though
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
doctor
,
I
can
tell
you
I
have
see
a
good
deal
of
service
in
all
part
of
the
world
,
and
,
of
course
,
pick
up
a
little
experience
;
and
,
if
I
be
you
,
some
of
these
day
,
<EOS>
when
Mrs.
Chillingworth
be
not
very
well
,
I
would
give
her
a
composing
draught
that
would
make
her
quiet
enough
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
that
be
not
my
style
of
practice
,
admiral
;
but
I
be
sorry
to
hear
that
Mrs.
Chillingworth
have
annoy
you
so
much
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pho
,
pho
,
man!--pho
,
pho
!
<EOS>
do
you
think
she
could
annoy
me
?
<EOS>
why
,
I
have
encounter
storm
and
squall
in
all
latitude
,
and
it
be
not
a
woman
's
tongue
now
that
can
do
anything
of
an
annoying
character
,
I
can
tell
you
;
far
from
it
--
very
far
from
it
;
<EOS>
so
do
not
distress
yourself
upon
that
head
.
<EOS>
but
come
,
doctor
,
we
be
go
to
have
the
wedding
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
Flora
;
"
the
week
after
next
,
you
mean
,
"
 
"
be
it
the
week
after
next
?
<EOS>
I
will
be
hang
if
I
do
not
think
it
be
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
;
<EOS>
but
of
course
you
know
best
,
as
you
have
settle
it
all
among
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
I
shall
,
with
great
pleasure
,
"
return
the
doctor
,
"
be
present
on
the
interesting
occasion
;
but
do
you
intend
take
possession
of
Bannerworth
Hall
again
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
certainly
not
,
"
say
Henry
;
"
we
propose
go
to
the
Dearbrook
estate
,
and
there
remain
for
a
time
to
see
how
we
all
like
it
.
<EOS>
We
may
,
perchance
,
enjoy
it
very
much
,
for
I
have
hear
it
speak
of
as
an
attractive
little
property
enough
,
and
one
that
any
one
may
fancy
,
after
be
resident
a
short
time
upon
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
the
admiral
;
"
that
is
,
I
believe
,
settle
among
us
,
but
I
be
sure
we
sha'n't
like
it
,
on
account
of
the
want
of
the
sea
.
<EOS>
why
,
I
tell
you
,
I
have
not
see
a
ship
myself
for
this
eighteen
month
;
there
be
a
state
of
thing
,
you
see
,
that
will
not
do
to
last
,
because
one
would
get
dry
-
mouldy
<EOS>
:
it
be
a
shocking
thing
to
see
nothing
but
land
,
land
,
wherever
you
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
from
the
precede
conversation
may
be
gather
what
be
the
design
of
the
Bannerworth
family
,
and
what
progress
have
be
make
in
carry
them
out
.
<EOS>
from
the
moment
they
have
discover
the
title
-
deed
of
the
Dearbrook
property
,
they
have
cease
to
care
about
the
large
sum
of
money
which
Marmaduke
Bannerworth
have
be
suppose
to
have
hide
in
some
portion
of
Bannerworth

<EOS>
They
have
already
pass
through
quite
enough
of
the
busy
turmoil
of
existence
to
be
grateful
for
anything
that
promise
ease
and
competence
,
and
that
serenity
of
mind
which
be
the
dear
possession
which
any
one
can
compass
.
 
<EOS>
consequently
be
it
,
that
,
with
one
accord
,
they
get
rid
of
all
yearning
after
the
large
sum
which
the
doctor
be
so
anxious
to
procure
for
them
,
and
look
forward
to
a
life
of
great
happiness
and
contentment
.
<EOS>
on
the
whole
,
too
,
when
they
come
to
talk
the
matter
over
quietly
among
themselves
,
they
be
not
sorry
that
Varney
have
take
himself
off
in
the
way
he
have
,
for
<EOS>
really
it
be
a
great
release
;
and
,
as
he
have
couch
his
farewell
in
word
which
signify
it
be
a
final
one
,
they
be
incline
to
think
that
he
must
have
leave
England
,
and
that
it
be
not
likely
they
should
ever
again
encounter
him
,
under
any
circumstance
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
consider
quite
as
a
whim
of
the
old
admiral
's
,
the
changing
of
Charles
Holland
's
name
to
Bell
;
but
,
as
Charles
himself
say
when
the
subject
be
broach
to
him,--"i
be
so
well
content
to
be
call
whatever
those
to
whom
I
feel
affection
think
proper
,
that
I
give
up
my
name
of
Holland
without
a
pang
,
willingly
adopt
in
its
stead
one
that
have
always
be
hallowed
in
my
remembrance
with
the
good
and
kindest
recollection
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
thus
this
affair
be
settle
,
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
Flora
,
who
be
quite
as
well
content
to
be
call
Mrs.
Bell
as
to
be
call
Mrs.
Holland
,
since
the
object
of
her
attachment
remain
the
same
.
<EOS>
the
wedding
be
really
fix
for
the
week
after
that
which
follow
the
conversation
we
have
record
;
but
the
admiral
be
not
at
all
dispose
to
allow
Flora
and
his
nephew
Charles
to
get
through
such
an
important
period
of
their
life
without
some
great
demonstration
and
show
than
could
be
make
from
the
little
cottage
where
they
dwelt
;
and
consequently
he
wish
that
they
should
leave
that
and
proceed
at
once
to
a
large
mansion
,
which
he
have
his
eye
upon
a
few
mile
off
,
and
which
be
to
be
have
furnish
for
a
time
,
at
the
pleasure
of
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
we
will
not
shut
ourselves
up
,
"
say
the
admiral
;
"
but
we
will
find
out
all
the
Christian
-
like
people
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
invite
them
to
the
wedding
,
and
we
will
have
a
jolly
good
breakfast
together
,
and
lot
of
music
,
and
a
famous
lunch
;
and
,
after
that
,
a
dinner
,
and
then
a
dance
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
;
so
that
there
shall
be
no
want
of
fun
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
as
may
be
well
suppose
,
both
Charles
and
Flora
shrink
from
so
public
an
affair
;
but
,
as
the
old
man
have
evidently
set
his
heart
upon
it
,
they
do
not
like
to
say
they
positively
would
not
;
so
,
after
a
vain
attempt
to
dissuade
him
from
remove
at
all
from
the
cottage
until
they
remove
for
good
,
they
give
up
the
point
to
him
,
and
he
have
it
all
his
own
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
the
house
,
for
one
month
,
which
have
so
take
his
fancy
,
and
certainly
a
pretty
enough
place
it
be
,
although
they
find
out
afterwards
,
that
why
it
be
he
be
so
charm
with
it
consist
in
the
fact
that
it
bear
the
name
of
a
vessel
which
he
have
once
command
;
but
this
they
do
not
know
until
a
long
time
afterwards
,
when
it
slip
out
by
mere
accident
.
 
<EOS>
They
stipulate
with
the
admiral
that
there
should
not
be
more
than
twenty
guest
at
the
breakfast
which
be
to
succeed
the
marriage
ceremony
;
and
to
that
he
accede
;
but
Henry
whisper
to
Charles
<EOS>
holland,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
this
public
wedding
to
be
distasteful
to
you
,
and
most
particularly
do
I
know
it
be
distasteful
to
Flora
;
so
,
if
you
do
not
mind
play
a
trick
upon
the
old
man
,
I
can
very
easily
put
you
in
the
way
of
cheat
him
entirely
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
;
I
should
like
to
hear
,
and
,
what
be
more
,
I
should
like
to
practise
,
if
you
think
it
will
not
so
entirely
offend
him
as
to
make
him
implacable
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
,
not
at
all
;
he
will
laugh
himself
,
when
he
come
to
know
it
,
as
much
as
any
of
us
;
the
present
difficulty
will
be
to
procure
Flora
's
connivance
;
but
that
we
must
do
the
good
way
we
can
by
persuasion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
what
this
scheme
be
will
ultimately
appear
;
but
,
certain
it
be
,
that
the
old
admiral
have
no
suspicion
of
what
be
go
on
,
and
proceed
to
make
all
his
arrangement
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
from
his
first
arrival
in
the
market
town
--
in
the
neighbourhood
of
which
be
Bannerworth
Hall
--
it
will
be
recollect
that
he
have
take
a
great
fancy
to
the
lawyer
,
in
whose
name
a
forge
letter
have
be
send
him
,
inform
him
of
the
fact
that
his
nephew
,
Charles
Holland
,
intend
marry
into
a
family
of
vampyre
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
this
letter
,
as
the
reader
be
aware
,
which
bring
the
old
admiral
and
Jack
Pringle
into
the
neighbourhood
of
the
Hall
;
and
,
although
it
be
a
manoeuvre
to
get
rid
of
Charles
Holland
,
which
fail
most
signally
,
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
that
such
a
letter
be
the
production
of
Sir
Francis
Varney
,
and
that
he
write
it
for
the
express
purpose
of
get
rid
of
Charles
from
the
Hall
,
who
have
begin
materially
to
interfere
with
his
plan
and
project
there
.
 
<EOS>
after
some
conversation
with
himself
,
the
admiral
think
that
this
lawyer
would
be
just
the
man
to
recommend
the
proper
sort
of
people
to
be
invite
to
the
wedding
of
Charles
and
Flora
;
so
he
write
to
him
,
invite
himself
to
dinner
,
and
receive
back
a
very
gracious
reply
from
the
lawyer
,
who
declare
that
the
honour
of
entertain
a
gentleman
whom
he
so
much
respect
as
Admiral
Bell
,
be
great
than
he
have
a
right
to
expect
by
a
great
deal
,
and
that
he
should
feel
most
grateful
for
his
company
,
and
await
his
come
with
the
great
impatience
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
devilish
civil
fellow
,
that
attorney
,
"
say
the
admiral
,
as
he
put
the
letter
in
his
pocket
,
"
and
almost
enough
to
put
one
in
conceit
of
lawyer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Jack
Pringle
,
who
have
overhear
the
admiral
read
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
we
will
honour
him
;
and
I
only
hope
he
will
have
plenty
of
grog
;
because
,
you
see
,
if
he
don't
--
D
--
<EOS>
n
it
!
<EOS>
what
be
that
?
<EOS>
can
not
you
keep
thing
to
yourself
?
"
 
<EOS>
this
latter
exclamation
arise
from
the
fact
that
the
admiral
be
so
indignant
at
Jack
for
listen
to
what
he
have
be
say
,
as
to
throw
a
leaden
inkstand
,
that
happen
to
be
upon
the
table
,
at
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
mutinous
swab
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
"
can
not
a
gentleman
ask
me
to
dinner
,
or
can
not
I
ask
myself
,
without
you
put
your
speak
in
the
windlass
,
you
vagabond
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
well
,
"
say
Jack
,
"
if
you
be
out
of
temper
about
it
,
I
have
better
send
my
mark
to
the
lawyer
,
and
tell
him
that
we
will
not
come
,
as
it
have
make
some
family
difference
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
family
,
you
thief
!
"
say
the
admiral
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
what
family
do
you
think
would
own
you
?
<EOS>
d
--
<EOS>
n
me
,
if
I
do
not
think
you
come
over
in
some
strange
ship
.
<EOS>
but
,
I
tell
you
what
it
be
,
<EOS>
if
you
interfere
in
this
matter
,
I
will
be
hang
if
I
do
not
blow
your
brain
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
you
will
be
hang
if
you
do
,
"
say
Jack
,
as
he
walk
out
of
the
room
;
"
so
it
be
all
one
either
way
,
old
fizgig
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
"
roar
the
admiral
,
as
he
spring
up
and
run
after
Jack
.
"
<EOS>
have
I
live
all
these
year
to
be
call
name
in
my
own
ship
--
I
mean
my
own
house
?
<EOS>
what
do
the
infernal
rascal
mean
by
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
the
admiral
,
no
doubt
,
would
have
pursue
Jack
very
closely
,
have
not
Flora
intercept
him
,
and
,
by
gentle
violence
,
get
him
back
to
the
room
.
<EOS>
no
one
else
could
have
venture
to
have
stop
him
,
but
the
affection
he
have
for
her
be
so
great
that
she
could
really
accomplish
almost
anything
with
him
;
and
,
by
listen
quietly
to
his
complaint
of
Jack
Pringle
--
which
,
however
,
involve
a
disclosure
of
the
fact
which
he
have
intend
to
keep
to
himself
,
that
he
have
seek
the
lawyer
's
advice
<EOS>
--
she
succeed
in
soothe
him
completely
,
so
that
he
forget
his
anger
in
a
very
short
time
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
old
man
's
anger
,
although
easily
arouse
,
never
last
very
long
;
and
,
upon
the
whole
,
it
be
really
astonishing
what
he
put
up
with
from
Jack
Pringle
,
in
the
way
of
taunt
and
sneer
,
of
all
sort
and
description
,
and
now
and
then
not
a
little
real
abuse
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
probably
,
he
think
likewise
that
Jack
Pringle
do
not
mean
what
he
say
,
on
the
same
principle
that
he
(
the
admiral
)
,
when
he
call
Jack
a
mutinous
swab
and
a
marine
,
certainly
do
not
mean
that
Jack
be
those
thing
,
but
merely
use
them
as
expletive
to
express
a
great
amount
of
indignation
at
the
moment
,
because
,
as
may
be
well
suppose
,
nothing
in
the
world
could
be
bad
,
in
Admiral
Bell
's
estimation
,
that
to
be
a
mutinous
swab
or
a
marine
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
rather
a
wonder
,
though
,
that
,
in
his
anger
some
day
,
he
do
not
do
Jack
some
mischief
;
for
,
as
we
have
have
occasion
to
notice
in
one
or
two
case
,
the
admiral
be
not
extremely
particular
as
to
what
sort
of
missile
he
use
when
he
consider
it
necessary
to
throw
something
at
Jack
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
not
have
be
a
surprising
thing
if
Jack
have
really
make
some
communication
to
the
lawyer
;
but
he
do
stop
short
at
that
amount
of
pleasantry
,
and
,
as
he
himself
express
it
,
for
once
in
a
way
he
let
the
old
man
please
himself
.
 
<EOS>
the
admiral
soon
forget
this
little
dispute
,
and
then
please
himself
with
the
idea
that
he
should
pass
a
pleasant
day
with
the
attorney
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
well
,
"
he
say
;
"
who
would
have
think
that
ever
I
should
have
go
and
take
dinner
with
a
lawyer
--
and
not
only
do
that
,
but
invite
myself
too
!
<EOS>
It
show
us
all
that
there
may
be
some
good
in
all
sort
of
man
,
lawyer
include
;
and
I
be
sure
,
after
this
,
I
ought
to
begin
to
think
what
I
never
think
before
,
and
that
is
,
that
a
marine
may
actually
be
a
useful
person
.
<EOS>
It
show
that
,
as
one
get
old
,
one
get
wise
.

<EOS>
It
be
an
immense
piece
of
liberality
for
a
man
bring
up
,
as
Admiral
Bell
have
be
,
in
decidedly
one
of
the
most
prejudiced
branch
of
the
public
service
,
to
make
any
such
admission
as
these
.
<EOS>
a
very
great
thing
it
be
,
and
show
a
liberality
of
mind
such
as
,
even
at
the
present
time
,
be
not
readily
find
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
astonishing
,
as
well
as
amusing
,
to
find
how
the
mind
assimilate
itself
to
the
circumstance
in
which
it
be
place
,
and
how
society
,
be
cut
up
into
small
section
,
imago
different
thing
merely
as
a
consequence
of
their
peculiar
application
.
<EOS>
We
shall
find
that
even
people
,
live
at
different
end
of
a
city
,
will
look
with
a
sort
of
pity
and
contempt
upon
each
other
;
and
it
be
much
to
be
regret
that
public
writer
be
find
who
use
what
little
ability
they
may
possess
in
pander
to
their
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
as
contemptible
and
silly
as
it
be
reprehensible
for
a
late
celebrated
novelist
to
pretend
that
he
believe
there
be
at
place
call
Bloomsbury
-
square
,
but
he
really
do
not
know
;
because
that
be
merely
do
for
the
purpose
of
raise
a
silly
laugh
among
person
who
be
neither
respectable
on
account
of
their
ability
or
their
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
but
to
return
from
this
digression
.
<EOS>
the
admiral
,
attire
in
his
good
suit
,
which
always
consist
of
a
blue
coat
,
the
exact
colour
of
the
navy
uniform
,
an
immense
pale
primrose
coloured
waistcoat
,
and
white
kerseymere
continuation
,
go
to
the
lawyer
's
as
have
be
arrange
.
 
<EOS>
if
anything
at
all
could
flatter
the
old
man
's
vanity
successfully
,
it
certainly
would
be
the
manner
in
which
he
be
receive
at
the
lawyer
's
house
,
where
everything
be
do
that
could
give
him
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
a
very
handsome
repast
be
lay
before
him
,
and
,
when
the
cloth
be
remove
,
the
admiral
broach
the
subject
upon
which
he
wish
to
ask
the
advice
of
his
professional
friend
.
<EOS>
after
tell
him
of
the
wedding
that
be
to
come
off
,
he
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
now
,
I
have
bargain
to
invite
twenty
people
;
and
,
of
course
,
as
that
be
exclusive
of
any
of
the
family
,
and
as
I
do
not
know
any
people
about
this
neighbourhood
except
yourself
,
I
want
you
and
your
family
to
come
to
start
with
,
and
then
I
want
you
to
find
me
out
some
more
decent
people
to
make
up
the
party
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
feel
highly
flattered
,
"
say
the
attorney
,
"
that
,
in
such
a
case
as
this
,
you
should
have
come
to
me

my
only
great
fear
be

that
I
should
not
be
able
to
give
you

none

"
 
<EOS>
It
be
quite
evident
that
Jack
have
do
justice
to
the
good
cheer
of
the
lawyer
,
for
he
be
rather
unsteady
,
and
have
to
hold
by
the
door
-
post
to
support
himself
,
while
there
be
such
a
look
of
contentment
upon
his
countenance
as
contrast
with
the
indignation
that
be
manifest
upon
the
admiral
's
face
that
,
as
the
saying
be
,
it
would
have
make
a
cat
laugh
to
see
them

"
be
off

be
off

<EOS>
go
down
stair
again

enjoy
yourself
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
see
that
the

be
angry
with
you

<EOS>
"
oh
,
he
be
bother
,
"
say
Jack
;
"
I
will
soon
settle
him
if
he
come
any
of
his
nonsense
;
and
mind
,
Mr.
Lawyer
,
whatever
you
do
,
do
not
you
give
him
too
much
to
drink
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
lawyer
run
to
the
door
,
and
push
Jack
out
,
for
he
rightly
enough
suspect
that
the
quietness
of
the
admiral
be
only
that
calm
which
precede
a
storm
of
more
than
usual
amount
and
magnitude
,
so
he
be
anxious
to
part
them
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
set
about
appease
,
as
well
as
he
could
,
the
admiral
's
anger
,
by
attribute
the
perseverance
of
Jack
,
in
follow
him
wherever
he
go
,
to
his
great
affection
for
him
,
which
,
combine
with
his
ignorance
,
may
make
him
often
troublesome
when
he
have
really
no
intention
of
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
certainly
the
good
way
of
appease
the
old
man
;
and
,
indeed
,
the
only
way
in
which
it
could
be
do
successfully
,
and
the
proof
that
it
be
so
,
consist
in
the
fact
,
that
the
admiral
do
consent
,
at
the
suggestion
of
the
attorney
,
to
forgive
Jack
once
more
for
the
offence
he
have
commit
.

CHAPTER
XCVI
.
 
<EOS>
the
BARON
TAKES
ANDERBURY
HOUSE
,
and
<EOS>
decide
upon
give
a
GRAND
ENTERTAINMENT
.
  
<EOS>
[
illustration
]
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
consider
anything
extraordinary
that
,
although
the
Baron
Stolmuyer
of
Saltzburgh
go
out
with
the
mysterious
stranger
who
have
arrive
at
the
Anderbury
Arms
to
see
him
,
he
should
return
without
him
for
<EOS>
certainly
he
be
not
bind
to
bring
him
back
,
by
any
mean
<EOS>
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
moreover
,
he
enter
the
inn
so
quietly
,
and
with
such
an
appearance
of
perfect
composure
,
that
no
one
could
have
suspect
for
a
moment
that
he
have
be
guilty
really
of
the
terrific
crime
which
have
be
lay
to
his
charge
--
a
crime
which
few
man
could
have
commit
in
so
entirely
unmoved
and
passionless
a
manner
as
he
have
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
seem
to
consider
the
taking
of
a
human
life
as
a
thing
not
of
the
remote
consequence
,
and
not
to
be
consider
at
all
as
a
matter
which
be
to
put
any
one
out
of
the
way
,
but
as
a
thing
to
be
do
when
necessity
require
,
with
all
the
ease
in
the
world
,
without
arouse
or
awake
any
of
those
feeling
of
remorse
which
one
would
suppose
ought
to
find
a
place
in
the
heart
of
a
man
who
have
be
guilty
of
such
monstrous
behaviour
.
 
<EOS>
He
walk
up
to
his
own
apartment
again
,
and
retire
to
rest
with
the
same
feeling
,
apparently
,
of
calmness
,
and
the
same
ability
to
taste
of
the
sweet
of
repose
as
have
before
characterize
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
stranger
's
horse
,
which
be
a
valuable
and
beautiful
animal
,
remain
in
the
stable
of
the
inn
,
and
as
,
of
course
,
that
be
consider
a
guarantee
for
his
return
,
the
landlord
,
when
he
himself
retire
to
rest
,
leave
one
of
his
establishment
sit
up
to
let
in
the
man
who
now
lie
so
motionless
and
so
frightful
in
appearance
in
one
of
the
ice
-
well
of
the
mysterious
passage
lead
from
the
base
of
the
cliff
,
to
the
ground
of
Anderbury
House
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
night
wear
on
,
and
the
man
who
have
be
leave
to
let
the
stranger
in
,
after
make
many
effort
to
keep
himself
awake
,
drop
into
sound
repose
,
which
he
may
just
as
well
have
do
in
the
first
instance
,
inasmuch
as
,
although
he
know
it
not
,
he
be
engage
in
the
vain
task
of
wait
for
the
dead
.
 
<EOS>
the
morning
be
fresh
and
beautiful
,
and
,
at
a
far
early
hour
than
a
person
of
his
quality
be
expect
to
make
his
appearance
,
the
baron
descend
from
his
chamber
;
for
,
somehow
or
other
,
by
common
consent
,
it
seem
to
be
agree
that
great
personage
must
be
late
in
rise
,
and
equally
late
in
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
baron
be
evidently
not
so
disposed
to
turn
night
into
day
,
and
the
landlord
congratulate
himself
not
a
little
upon
the
fact
that
he
be
ready
for
his
illustrious
guest
when
he
descend
so
unexpectedly
from
his
chamber
as
he
do
.
 
<EOS>
an
ample
breakfast
be
dispose
of
;
that
be
to
say
,
it
be
place
upon
the
table
,
and
charge
to
the
baron
,
who
select
from
it
what
he
please
;
and
when
the
meal
be
over
the
landlord
venture
to
enter
the
apartment
,
and
say
to
him
,
with
all
due
humility,--
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
please
,
sir
,
Mr.
Leek
,
who
have
the
letting
of
Anderbury

Anderbury
House

here

and
would
be
happy
to
take
your
order
as
to
when
you
would
be
pleased
to
look
at
those
premise
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
ready
to
go
in
half
a
hour
,
"
say
the
baron
;
"
and
,
as
the
distance
be
not
great
,
I
will
walk
from
here
to
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
message
be
duly
communicate
to
Mr.
Leek
,
who
thereupon
determine
upon
wait
until
the
baron
should
announce
his
readiness
to
depart
upon
the
expedition
;
and
he
be
as
good
as
his
word
,
for
,
in
about
half
-
an
-
hour
afterwards
<EOS>
,
he
descend
to
the
hall
,
and
then
Mr.
Leek
be
summon
,
who
come
out
of
the
bar
with
such
a
grand
rush
,
that
he
fall
over
a
mat
that
be
before
him
,
and
salute
the
baron
by
dig
his
head
into
his
stomach
,
and
then
fall
sprawl
at
his
foot
,
and
lay
hold
of
his
ankle
.
 
<EOS>
this
little
incident
be
duly
apologise
for
,
and
explain
;
after
which
Mr.
Leek
walk
on
through
the
town
,
towards
Anderbury
-
on
-
the
-
Mount
,
follow
by
the
illustrious
personage
whom
he
sincerely
hope
he
should
be
able
to
induce
to
take
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
curious
thing
to
see
how
they
traverse
the
street
together
;
for
while
the
baron
walk
right
on
,
and
with
a
solemn
and
measured
step
,
Mr.
Leek
manage
to
get
along
a
few
pace
in
front
of
him
,
sideways
,
so
that
he
could
keep
up
a
sort
of
conversation
upon
the
merit
of
Anderbury
House
,
and
the
neighbourhood
in
general
,
without
much
effort
;
to
which
remark
the
baron
make
such
suitable
and
dignified
reply
as
a
baron
would
be
suppose
to
make
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
,
sir
,
"
say
Mr.
Leek
,
"
that
everything
about
Anderbury
be
extremely
select
,
and
amazingly
correct
;
and
I
be
sure
a
more
delightful
place
to
live
in
could
not
be
find
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
baron
;
"
very
likely
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
lively
,
too
,
"
continue
Mr.
Leek
;
"
very
lively
;
and
there
be
two
chapel
of
ease
,
besides
the
church
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
drawback
,
"
say
the
baron
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
drawback
,
sir
!
<EOS>
well
,
I
be
sorry
I
mention
it
;
but
perhaps
you
be
a
Roman
Catholic
,
sir
,
and
,
in
that
case
,
the
chapel
of
ease
have
no
interest
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
the
slight
;
but
do
not
,
sir
,
run
away
with
any
assumption
concern
my
religious
opinion
,
for
I
be
not
a
roman
Catholic
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
,
no
,
sir
;
nor
more
be
I
;
and
,
as
far
as
I
think
,
and
my
opinion
go
,
I
say
,
why
should
not
a
gentleman
with
a
large
fortune
be
what
he
like
,
or
nothing
,
if
he
like
that
better
?
<EOS>
but
here
we
be
,
sir
,
close
to
one
of
the
entrance
of
Anderbury
House
.
<EOS>
there
be
three
principal
entrance
,
you
understand
,
sir
,
on
three
side
of
the
estate
,
and
the
fourth
side
face
the
sea
,
where
there
be
that
mysterious
passage
that
lead
down
from
the
ground
to
the
beach
,
which
,
perhaps
,
you
have
hear
of
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
landlord
of
the
inn
mention
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
consider
it
a
great
curiosity
,
sir
<EOS>
,
I
can
assure
you
,
in
these
part
--
a
very
great
curiosity
;
and
it
be
an
immense
advantage
to
the
house
,
because
,
you
see
,
sir
,
in
extremely
hot
weather
,
all
sort
of
provision
can
be
take
down
there
,
and
keep
at
such
a
very
low
temperature
as
to
be
quite
delightful
.

<EOS>
"
that
be
an
advantage

<EOS>
Mr.
Leek
ring
the
bell
that
hang
over
one
of
the
entrance
,
and
his
summon
for
admission
be
speedily
answer
by
the
old
couple
who
have
charge
of
the
premise
,
and
then
,
with
a
view
of
impress
them
with
a
notion

he
say
,
aloud,--
 
<EOS>
"
the
Baron
Stoltmayor
,
of
Saltsomething
,
have
come
to
look
at
the
premise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
announcement
be
receive
with
all
due
deference
and
respect
,
and
the
task
of
show
the
baron
the
premise
at
once
fairly
commence
.
 
<EOS>
"
here
you
have
,
"
say
Mr.
Leek
,
assume
an
oratorical
<EOS>
attitude--"here
you
have
the
umbrageous
tree
stoop
down
to
dip
their
leave
in
the
purling
water
;
here
you
have
the
sweet
foliage
lend
a
delicious
perfume
to
the
balmy
air
;
here
you
have
the
murmur
waterfall
play
music
of
the
sphere
to
the
listening
bird
,
who
sit
responsive
upon
the
dancing
bough
;
here
you
have
all
the
fragrance
of
the
briny
ocean
,
mingle
with
the
scent
of
a
bank
of
violet
,
and
wrap
the
sense
in
Elysium
;
here
you
may
never
tire
of
an
existence
that
present
never
-
end
charm
,
and
that
,
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
which
,
you
may
live
far
beyond
the
allotted
span
of
man
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
enough
--
enough
,
"
say
the
baron
.
 
<EOS>
"
here
you
have
the
choice
exotic
take
kindly
to
a
soil
gift
by
nature
with
the
most
extraordinary
power
of
production
;
and
all
that
can
pamper
the
appetite
or
yield
delight
to
the
sense
,
be
scatter
around
by
nature
with
a
liberal
hand
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
impossible
that
royalty
should
come
near
the
favour
spot
without
visit
it
as
a
thing
of
course
;
and
I
forgot
to
mention
that
a
revenue
be
derive
from
some
cottage
,
which
,
although
small
,
be
yet
sufficient
to
pay
the
tithe
on
the
whole
estate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
,
there
--
that
will
do
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
here
you
have
purling
rill
and
cascade
,
and
fish
-
pond
so
redundant
with
the
finny
tribe
,
that
you
have
but
to
wish
for
sport
,
and
it
be
yours
;
<EOS>
here
you
have
in
the
mansion
,
chamber
that
vie
with
the
accommodation
of
a
palace
--
ample
dormitory
and
hall
of
ancient
grandeur
;
here
you
have--
"
 
"
stop
,
"
say
the
baron
,
"
stop
;
I
can
not
be
pester
in
this
way
with
your
description
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
patience
to
listen
to
such
mere
word
--
show
me
the
house
at
once
,
and
let
me
judge
for
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
sir
;
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
certainly
;
only
I
think
it
right
to
give
you
a
slight
description
of
the
place
as
it
really
be
:
and
now
,
sir
,
that
we
have
reach
the
house
<EOS>
,
I
may
remark
<EOS>
that
here
we
have--
"
 
"
silence
!
"
say
the
baron
;
"
if
you
begin
with
here
we
have
,
I
know
not
when
you
will
leave
off
.
<EOS>
all
I
require
of
you
be
to
show
me
the
place
,
and
to
answer
any
question
which
I
may
put
to
you
concern
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
draw
my
own
conclusion
,
and
nothing
you
can
say
,
one
way
or
another
,
will
affect
my
imagination
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
sir
,
certainly
;
I
shall
only
be
too
happy
to
answer
any
question
that
may
be
put
to
me
by
a
person
of
your
lordship
's
great
intelligence
;
and
all
I
can
remark
be
,
that
when
you
reach
the
drawing
-
room
floor
,
any
person
may
truly
say
,
here
you
have
--
I
really
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
--
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
slight
intention
of
say
here
you
have
,
I
assure
you
;
but
the
word
come
out
quite
unawares
,
I
assure
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
peace
--
peace
!
"
<EOS>
cry
again
the
baron
;
"
you
disturb
me
by
this
incessant
clatter
.
"
 
<EOS>
thus
admonish
,
Mr.
Leek
be
now
quiet
,
and
allow
the
baron
in
his
own
way
to
make
what
investigation
he
please
concern
Anderbury
House
.
 
<EOS>
the
investigation
be
not
one
that
could
be
go
over
in
ten
minute
;
for
the
house
be
extremely
extensive
,
and
the
estate
altogether
present
so
many
feature
of
beauty
and
interest
,
that
it
be
impossible
not
to
linger
over
it
for
a
considerable
period
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
the
ground
be
most
extensive
,
and
plant
with
such
a
regard
to
order
and
regularity
,
everything
be
in
its
proper
place
,
that
it
be
a
pleasure
to
see
an
estate
so
well
keep
.
<EOS>
and
although
the
baron
be
not
a
man
who
say
much
,
it
be
quite
evident
,
by
what
little
he
do
utter
,
that
he
be
very
well
pleased
with
Anderbury
-
on
-
the
-
Mount
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
"
say
Mr.
Leek
,
"
I
will
do
myself
the
pleasure
,
sir
,
of
show
your
grace
the
subterranean
passage
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
at
this
moment
a
loud
ring
at
one
of
the
entrance
gate
be
hear
,
and
upon
the
man
who
have
charge
of
the
house
answer
the
summon
for
admission
,
he
find
that
it
be
a
gentleman
,
who
give
a
card
on
which
be
the
name
of
Sir
John
Westlake
,
and
who
desire
to
see
the
premise
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
John
Westlake
,
"
say
Mr.
Leek
;
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
recollect
he
do
call
at
my
office
,
and
say
that
he
think
of
take
Anderbury
-
on
-
the
-
Mount
.
<EOS>
a
gentleman
of
great
and
taste
be
Sir
John
,
but
I
must
tell
him
,
baron
,
that
you
have
the
preference
if
you
choose
to
embrace
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
this
moment
the
stranger
advance
,
and
when
he
see
the
baron
,
he
bow
courteously
,
upon
which
Mr.
Leek
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
regret
,
Sir
John
,
that
if
you
should
take
a
fancy
to
the
place
,
I
be
compel
first
of
all
to
give
this
gentleman
the
refusal
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
"
say
Sir
John
Westlake
;
"
do
not
let
me
interfere
with
any
one
.
<EOS>
I
have
nearly
make
up
my
mind
,
and
come
to
look
over
the
property
again
;
but
of
course
,
if
this
gentleman
be
beforehand
with
me
,
I
must
be
content
.
<EOS>
I
wish
particularly
to
go
down
to
the
subterranean
passage
to
the
beach
,
if
it
be
not
too
much
trouble
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
trouble
!
<EOS>
certainly
not
,
sir
.
<EOS>
here
,
Davis
,
get
some
link
,
and
we
can
go
at
once
;
and
as
this
gentleman
likewise
have
see
everything
but
that
strange
excavation
,
he
will
probably
descend
with
us
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
"
say
the
baron
;
"
I
shall
have
great
pleasure
;
"
and
he
say
it
with
so
free
and
unembarrasse
an
air
,
that
no
one
could
have
believe
for
a
moment
in
the
possibility
that
such
a
subject
of
fearful
interest
to
him
be
there
to
be
find
.
 
<EOS>
the
entrance
from
the
ground
into
this
deep
cavernous
place
be
in
a
small
but
neat
building
,
that
look
like
a
summer
-
house
;
and
now
,
torch
be
procure
,
and
one
lit
,
a
door
be
open
,
which
conduct
at
once
into
the
commencement
of
the
excavation
;
and
Mr.
Leek
head
the
way
,
<EOS>
the
distinguished
party
,
as
that
gentleman
love
afterwards
to
call
it
in
his
account
of
the
transaction
,
proceed
into
the
very
bowel
of
the
earth
,
as
it
be
,
and
quickly
lose
all
trace
of
the
daylight
.
 
<EOS>
the
place
do
not
descend
by
step
,
but
by
a
gentle
slope
,
which
it
require
some
caution
to
traverse
,
because
,
be
cut
in
the
chalk
,
which
in
some
place
be
wear
very
smooth
,
it
be
extremely
slippery
;
but
this
be
a
difficulty
that
a
little
practice
soon
overcome
,
and
as
they
go
on
the
place
become
more
interesting
every
minute
.
 
<EOS>
even
the
baron
allow
Mr.
Leek
to
make
a
speech
upon
the
occasion
,
and
that
gentleman
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
perceive
that
this
excavation
must
have
be
make
,
at
a
great
expense
,
out
of
the
solid
cliff
,
and
in
make
it
some
of
the
most
curious
specimen
of
petrifaction
and
fossil
remain
be
find
.
<EOS>
You
see
that
the
roof
be
vault
,
and
that
it
be
only
now
and
then
a
lump
of
chalk
have
fall
in
,
or
a
great
piece
of
flint
;
and
now
we
come
to
one
of
the
ice
-
wells
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
come
to
a
deep
excavation
,
down
which
they
look
,
and
when
the
man
hold
the
torch
beneath
its
surface
,
they
could
dimly
see
the
bottom
of
it
,
where
there
be
a
number
of
large
piece
of
flint
stone
,
and
,
apparently
,
likewise
,
the
remain
of
broken
bottle
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
use
to
be
a
windlass
at
the
top
of
this
,
"
say
Mr.
Leek
,
"
and
the
thing
be
let
down
in
a
basket
.
<EOS>
They
do
say
that
ice
will
keep
for
two
year
in
one
of
these
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
be
there
more
of
these
excavation
?
"
say
the
baron
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
dear
,
yes
,
sir
;
there
be
five
or
six
of
them
for
different
purpose
;
for
when
the
family
that
use
to
live
in
Anderbury
House
have
grand
entertainment
,
which
they
sometimes
have
in
the
summer
season
<EOS>
,
they
always
have
a
lot
of
man
down
here
,
cool
wine
,
and
pass
them
up
from
hand
to
hand
to
the
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
from
the
gradual
slope
of
this
passage
down
to
the
cliff
,
and
the
zigzag
character
of
it
,
it
may
be
well
suppose
that
it
be
of
considerable
extent
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
Mr.
Leek
assert
that
it
be
half
a
mile
in
actual
measure
length
.
 
<EOS>
the
baron
be
not
at
all
anxious
to
run
any
risk
of
a
discovery
of
the
dead
body
which
he
have
cast
into
that
ice
-
well
which
be
near
to
the
opening
on
to
the
beach
,
so
,
as
he
go
on
,
he
negative
the
different
proposal
that
be
make
to
look
down
into
the
excavation
,
and
succeed
in
put
a
stop
to
that
specie
of
inquiry
in
the
majority
of
instance
,
but
he
could
not
wholly
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
it
would
have
be
well
for
his
purpose
if
he
have
encourage
a
look
into
every
one
of
the
ice
-
well
;
for
,
in
that
case
,
their
similarity
of
appearance
may
have
tired
out
Sir
John
Westlake
before
they
get
to
the
last
one
;
but
as
it
be
,
when
they
reach
the
one
down
which
the
body
have
be
precipitate
,
he
have
the
mortification
to
hear
Mr.
Leek
<EOS>
say,--
 
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
Sir
John
,
and
you
,
my
lord
baron
,
as
we
have
look
at
the
first
of
these
ice
well
and
at
none
of
the
other
,
suppose
we
look
at
the
last
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
baron
be
afraid
to
say
anything
;
because
,
if
the
body
be
discover
,
and
identify
as
that
of
the
visitor
at
the
inn
,
and
who
have
be
see
last
with
him
,
any
reluctance
on
his
part
to
have
that
ice
-
well
examine
,
may
easily
afterwards
be
construe
into
a
very
powerful
piece
of
circumstantial
evidence
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
therefore
merely
bow
his
assent
,
think
that
the
examination
would
be
but
a
superficial
one
,
and
that
,
in
consequence
,
he
should
escape
easily
from
any
disagreeable
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
the
fate
ordain
otherwise
;
and
there
seem
no
hope
of
that
ice
-
well
in
particular
escaping
such
an
investigation
as
be
sure
to
induce
some
uncomfortable
result
.
 
<EOS>
"
Davis
,
"
say
Mr.
Leek
,
"
these
place
be
not
deep
,
you
see
,
and
I
be
think
that
if
you
go
down
one
of
them
,
it
would
be
as
well
;
for
then
you
would
be
able
to
tell
the
gentleman
what
the
bottom
be
fairly
compose
of
,
you
understand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
do
not
mind
,
sir
,
"
say
Davis
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
down
one
of
them
before
to
-
day
,
I
can
tell
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
the
necessity
,
"
say
Sir
John
Westlake
,
"
<EOS>
exactly
,
of
such
a
thing
;
but
still
if
you
please
,
and
this
gentleman
wishes--
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
wish
upon
the
occasion
,
"
say
the
baron
;
"
and
,
like
yourself
,
can
not
see
the
necessity
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
there
be
no
trouble
,
"
say
Mr.
Leek
;
"
and
it
be
well
,
now
you
be
here
,
that
you
see
and
understand
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
how
can
you
get
down
,
Davis
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
sir
,
it
be
not
above
fourteen
foot
altogether
;
so
I
sha'n't
have
any
difficulty
,
for
I
can
hang
by
my
hand
about
half
the
distance
,
and
drop
the
remainder
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
as
he
speak
he
take
off
his
coat
,
and
then
stick
the
link
he
carry
into
a
cleft
of
the
rock
,
that
be
beside
the
brink
of
the
excavation
.
 
<EOS>
the
baron
now
see
that
there
would
be
no
such
thing
as
avoid
a
discovery
of
the
fact
of
the
dead
body
be
in
that
place
,
and
his
only
hope
be
,
that
in
its
descent
it
may
have
become
so
injure
as
to
defy
identification
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
a
faint
hope
,
because
he
recollect
that
he
have
himself
see
the
face
,
which
be
turn
upwards
,
and
<EOS>
the
period
after
death
be
by
far
too
short
for
him
to
have
any
hope
that
decomposition
could
have
take
place
even
to
the
most
limited
extent
.
 
<EOS>
the
light
,
which
be
stick
in
a
niche
,
shed
but
a
few
inefficient
ray
down
into
the
pit
,
and
,
<EOS>
as
the
baron
stand
,
with
fold
arm
,
look
calmly
on
,
he
expect
each
moment
a
scene
of
surprise
and
terror
would
ensue
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
he
wrong
;
for
scarcely
have
the
man
plunge
down
into
that
deep
place
,
than
he
utter
a
cry
of
alarm
and
terror
,
and
shouted,--
 
"
murder
!
murder
!
<EOS>
lift
me
out
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
dead
man
down
here
,
and
I
have
jump
upon
him

cry
Mr.
Leek
and
Sir
John
Westlake
in
a
breath
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
very
strange
!
"
say
the
baron
.
 
<EOS>
"
lend
me
a
hand
,
"
cry
Davis
;
"
lend
me
a
hand
out
;
I
can
not
stand
this
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
lend
me
a
hand
out
,
I
say
,
at
once
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
easy
to
speak
of
than
to
do
,
and
Mr.
Davis
begin
to
discover
that
it
be
easy
by
far
to
get
into
a
deep
pit
,
than
to
get
out
of
one
,
notwithstanding
that
his
assertion
of
have
be
down
into
those
place
be
perfectly
true
;
but
then
he
have
meet
with
nothing
alarming
,
and
have
be
able
perfectly
at
his
leisure
to
scramble
out
the
good
way
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
his
frantic
effort
to
release
himself
from
a
much
more
uncomfortable
situation
than
he
have
imagine
it
possible
for
him
to
get
into
,
be
of
so
frantic
a
nature
,
that
he
only
half
bury
himself
in
piece
of
chalk
,
which
he
keep
pull
down
with
vehemence
from
the
side
of
the
pit
,
and
succeed
in
accomplish
nothing
towards
his
rescue
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
<EOS>
the
fellow
be
only
joke
,
"
say
the
baron
,
"
and
amuse
himself
at
our
expense
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
the
manner
in
which
the
man
cry
for
help
,
and
the
marked
terror
which
be
in
every
tone
,
be
quite
sufficient
to
prove
that
he
be
not
act
;
for
if
he
be
,
a
more
accomplished
mimic
could
not
have
be
find
on
the
stage
than
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
serious
,
"
say
Sir
John
Westlake
,
"
and
can
not
be
allow
.
<EOS>
have
you
any
rope
here
by
which
we
can
assist
him
from
the
pit
?
<EOS>
do
not
be
alarm
,
my
man
,
for
if
there
be
a
dead
body
in
the
pit
,
it
can
not
harm
you
.
<EOS>
take
your
time
quietly
and
easily
,
and
you
will
assuredly
get
out
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
aye
,
"
say
the
baron
,
"
the
more
haste
,
the
bad
speed
,
be
an
english
proverb
,
and
in
this
case
it
will
be
fully
exemplify
.
<EOS>
this
man
would
easily
leave
the
pit
,
if
he
would
have
the
patience
,
with
care
and
quietness
,
to
clamber
up
its
side
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
would
appear
that
Davis
feel
the
truth
of
these
exhortation
,
for
although
he
tremble
excessively
,
he
do
begin
to
make
some
progress
in
his
ascent
,
and
get
so
high
,
that
Mr.
Leek
be
enable
to
get
hold
of
his
hand
,
and
give
him
a
little
assistance
,
so
that
,
in
another
minute
or
so
,
he
be
rescue
from
his
situation
,
which
be
not
one
of
peril
,
although
it
be
certainly
one
of
fright
.
 
<EOS>
He
tremble
so
excessively
,
and
stutter
and
stammer
,
that
for
some
minute
no
one
could
understand
very
well
what
he
say
;
but
at
length
,
upon
make
himself
intelligible
,
he
exclaimed,--
 
<EOS>
"
there
have
be
a
murder
!
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
murder
commit
,
and
the
body
throw
into
the
ice
pit
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
jump
down
upon
something
soft
,
and
when
I
put
down
my
hand
to
feel
what
it
be
,
it
come
across
a
dead
man
's
face
,
and
then
,
of
course
,
I
call
out
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
certainly
do
call
out
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
and
so
would
anybody
,
I
think
,
under
such
circumstance
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
shall
be
hang
now
,
because
I
have
charge
of
the
house
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
do
not
strike
me
until
this
moment
,
"
say
the
baron
;
"
but
if
there
be
a
dead
body
in
that
pit
,
it
certainly
place
this
man
in
a
very
awkward
position
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
the
deuce
do
you
mean
?
"
say
Davis
;
"
I
do
not
know
no
more
about
it
than
the
child
unborn
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
dead
man
in
the
ice
-
well
,
and
that
be
all
I
know
about
it
;
but
whether
he
have
be
there
a
long
time
,
or
a
short
time
,
I
do
not
know
any
more
than
the
moon
,
so
it
be
no
use
bother
me
about
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
good
man
,
"
say
the
baron
,
"
it
would
be
very
wrong
indeed
to
impute
to
you
any
amount
of
criminality
in
this
business
,
since
you
may
be
entirely
innocent
;
and
I
,
for
one
,
believe
that
you
be
so
,
for
I
can
not
think
that
any
guilty
man
would
venture
into
the
place
where
he
have
put
the
body
of
his
victim
,
in
the
way
that
you
venture
into
that
pit
.
<EOS>
I
say
I
can
not
believe
it
possible
,
and
therefore
I
think
you
innocent
,
and
will
take
care
to
see
that
no
injustice
be
do
you
;
but
at
the
same
time
I
can
not
help
add
,
that
I
think
,
<EOS>
of
course
,
you
will
find
yourself
suspect
in
some
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
much
oblige
to
you
,
sir
,
"
say
Davis
;
"
<EOS>
but
as
I
happen
to
be
quite
innocent
,
I
be
very
easy
about
it
,
and
do
not
care
one
straw
what
people
say
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
be
in
this
excavation
for
Heaven
know
how
long
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
what
be
to
be
do
?
"
say
Mr.
Leek
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
be
our
duty
to
do
something
,
under
such
circumstance
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
unquestionably
,
"
say
the
baron
;
"
and
the
first
thing
to
be
do
,
be
to
inform
the
police
of
what
have
happen
,
so
that
the
body
may
be
get
up
;
and
as
I
have
now
see
enough
of
the
estate
to
satisfy
me
as
regard
its
capability
,
I
decide
at
once
upon
take
it
,
if
I
can
agree
upon
the
condition
of
the
tenancy
,
and
I
will
purchase
it
,
if
the
price
be
such
as
I
think
suitable
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Mr.
Leek
,
"
if
anything
could
reconcile
me
to
the
extraordinary
circumstance
that
have
just
occur
,
it
certainly
be
,
baron
,
<EOS>
the
have
so
desirable
a
tenant
for
Anderbury
-
on
-
the
-
Mount
as
yourself
.
<EOS>
but
we
need
not
traverse
all
this
passage
again
,
for
it
be
much
near
now
to
get
out
upon
the
sea
-
coast
at
once
,
as
we
be
so
close
to
the
other
opening
upon
the
beach
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
that
we
ought
to
proceed
at
once
to
the
town
,
and
give
information
to
the
authority
of
the
discovery
which
we
have
make
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
absolutely
necessary
,
"
say
the
baron
,
"
so
to
do
;
so
come
along
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
shall
proceed
to
my
inn
,
and
as
,
of
course
,
I
have
see
nothing
more
than
yourself
,
and
consequently
could
only
repeat
your
evidence
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
see
that
my
presence
be
call
for
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
of
course
,
if
the
justice
think
it
absolutely
necessary
that
I
should
appear
,
I
can
have
no
possible
objection
to
so
do
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
as
straightforward
as
anything
that
could
be
desire
,
and
,
moreover
,
it
be
rather
artfully
put
together
,
for
it
seem
to
imply
that
he
,
Mr.
Leek
,
would
be
slight
,
if
his
evidence
be
not
consider
sufficient
.
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
"
say
Mr.
Leek
;
"
I
do
not
see
at
all
why
,
as
you
,
sir
,
have
only
the
same
thing
to
say
as
myself
,
I
should
not

sufficient

"
 
<EOS>
"
do

Sir

oh
!
no
,
no
,
"
cry
Mr.
Leek
;
"
there
be
no
occasion

<EOS>
I

not

"
 
<EOS>
Sir
John
,
in
rather
a
nervous
and
excited
manner
,
bade
them
good
day
,
before
they
get
quite
into
the
town
,
and
hurry
off
;
while
the
baron
,
with
a
dignified
bow
,
when
he
reach
the
door
of
his
hotel
,
say
to
Mr.
Leek,--
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
do
not
like
the
trouble
of
judicial
investigation
more
than
anybody
else
,
and
therefore
,
unless
it
be
imperatively
necessary
that
I
should
appear
,
I
shall
take
it
as
a
favour
to
be
release
from
such
a
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
lord
baron
,
"
say
Mr.
Leek
,
"
you
may
depend
that
I
shall
mention
that
to
the
magistrate
and
the
coroner
,
and
all
those
sort
of
people
;
"
and
then
Mr.
Leek
walk
away
,
but
he
mutter
to
himself
,
as
he
do
so
,
"
They
will
have
him
,
as
sure
as
fate
,
just
because
he
be
a
baron
;
and
his
name
will
look
well
in
the
'
County
Chronicle
.
'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Leek
then
repair
immediately
to
the
house
of
one
of
the
principal
magistrate
,
and
relate
what
have
occur
,
to
the
great
surprise
of
that
gentleman
,
who
suggest
immediately
the
propriety
of
make
the
fact
know
to
the
coroner
of
the
district
,
as
it
be
more
his
business
,
than
a
magistrate
's
,
in
the
first
instance
,
since
nobody
be
accuse
of
the
offence
.
 
<EOS>
this
suggestion
be
immediately
follow
,
and
that
functionary
direct
that
the
body
should
be
remove
from
where
it
be
to
the
near
public
-
house
,
and
immediately
issue
his
precept
for
an
inquiry
into
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
the
matter
have
begin
to
get
bruit
about
in
the
town
,
and
of
course
it
go
from
mouth
to
mouth
with
many
exaggeration
;
and
although
it
by
no
means
do
follow
that
a
murder
have
be
commit
because
a
dead
body
have
be
find
,
yet
,
such
be
the
universal
impression
;
and
the
matter
begin
to
be
talk
about
as
the
murder
in
the
subterranean
passage
lead
to
Anderbury
House
,
with
all
the
gusto
which
the
full
particular
of
some
deed
of
blood
be
calculate
to
inspire
.
<EOS>
and
how
it
spread
about
be
thus:--
 
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
that
Mr.
Leek
be
so
anxious
to
let
Anderbury
-
on
-
the
-
Mount
to
the
rich
Baron
Stolmuyer
,
of
Saltzburgh
,
that
he
get
a
friend
of
his
to
come
and
personate
Sir
John
Westlake
,
while
he
,
the
baron
,
be
look
at
the
premise
,
in
order
to
drive
him
at
once
to
a
conclusion
upon
the
matter
;
so
that
what
make
Sir
John
so
very
anxious
that
he
should
not
be
call
forward
in
the
matter
,
consist
in
the
simple
fact
that
he
be
nothing
else
than
plain
Mr.
Brown
,
who
keep
a
hatter
's
shop
in
the
town
;
but
he
could
not
keep
his
own
counsel
,
and
,
instead
of
hold
his
tongue
,
as
he
ought
to
have
do
,
about
the
matter
,
he
tell
it
to
every
one
he
meet
,
so
that
in
a
short
time
it
be
generally
know
that
something
serious
and
startling
have
occur
in
the
subterranean
passage
to
Anderbury
House
,
and
a
great
mob
of
person
throng
the
beach
in
anxious
expectation
of
get
more
information
on
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
,
likewise
,
who
have
be
order
by
the
coroner
to
remove
the
body
,
soon
reach
the
spot
,
and
they
give
an
increase
impetus
to
the
proceeding
,
by
open
the
door
of
the
subterranean
passage
,
and
then
look
earnestly
along
the
beach
as
if
in
expectation
of
something
or
somebody
of
importance
.
 
<EOS>
when
eagerly
question
by
the
mob
,
for
the
throng
of
person
now
assemble
quite
amount
to
a
mob
,
to
know
what
they
wait
for
,
one
of
them
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
a
coffin
be
to
have
be
bring
down
to
take
the
body
in
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
announcement
at
once
remove
anything
doubtful
that
may
be
in
the
mind
of
any
of
them
upon
the
subject
,
and
at
once
proclaim
the
fact
not
only
that
there
be
a
dead
body
,
but
that
if
they
look
out
they
would
see
it
forthwith
.
 
<EOS>
the
throng
thicken
,
and
by
the
time
two
man
be
observe
approach
with
a
coffin
on
their
shoulder
,
there
be
scarcely
anybody
leave
in
the
town
,
except
a
few
rare
person
,
indeed
,
who
be
not
so
curious
as
their
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
an
agreeable
job
,
even
to
those
man
who
be
not
the
most
particular
in
the
world
,
to
be
remove
so
loathsome
a
spectacle
as
that
<EOS>
which
they
be
pretty
sure
to
encounter
in
the
ice
-
well
;
but
they
do
not
shrink
from
it
,
and
,
by
set
about
it
as
a
duty
,
they
get
through
it
tolerably
well
.
 
<EOS>
They
take
with
them
several
large
torch
,
and
then
,
one
have
descend
into
the
pit
,
fasten
a
rope
under
the
arm
of
the
dead
man
,
and
so
he
be
haul
out
,
and
place
in
the
shell
that
be
ready
to
receive
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
all
surprised
at
the
fresh
and
almost
healthful
appearance
of
the
countenance
,
and
it
be
quite
evident
to
everybody
that
if
any
one
have
know
him
in
life
,
they
could
not
have
the
least
possible
difficulty
in
recognise
him
now
that
he
be
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
only
appearance
of
injury
which
he
exhibit
be
in
that
dreadful
wound
which
have
certainly
prove
his
death
,
and
which
be
observable
in
his
throat
the
moment
they
look
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
[

<EOS>
the
crush
to
obtain
a
sight
of
the
body
be
tremendous
at
the
moment
it
be
bring
out
,
and
a
vast
concourse
of
person
follow
it
in
procession
to
the
town
,
where
the
great
excitement
prevail
.
<EOS>
It
be
easily
discover
that
no
know
person
be
miss
,
and
some
who
have
catch
a
sight
of
the
body
,
go
so
far
as
to
assert
that
it
must
have
be
in
the
ice
-
well
for
year
,
and
that
the
extreme
cold
have
preserve
it
in
all
its
original
freshness
.
 
<EOS>
the
news
,
of
course
,
come
round
,
although
not
through
the
baron
,
for
he
do
not
condescend
to
say
one
word
about
it
at
the
inn
,
and
it
be
the
landlord
who
first
start
the
suggestion
of--"what
suppose
it
be
the
gentleman
who
leave
his
horse
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
idea
have
no
sooner
get
possession
of
his
brain
,
than
it
each
moment
seem
to
him
to
assume
a
more
reasonable
and
tangible
form
,
and
without
say
any
more
to
any
one
else
about
it
,
he
at
once
start
off
to
where
the
body
lie
await
an
inquest
,
to
see
if
his
suspicion
be
correct
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
arrive
at
the
public
-
house
and
ask
to
see
the
body
,
he
be
at
once
permit
to
do
so
;
for
the
landlord
know
him
,
and
be
as
curious
as
he
could
be
upon
the
subject
by
any
possibility
.
<EOS>
one
glance
,
of
course
,
be
sufficient
,
and
the
landlord
at
once
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
have
see
him
before
,
though
I
do
not
know
his
name
.
<EOS>
He
come
to
my
house
last
night
,
and
leave
his
horse
there
;
and
,
although
I
only
see
him
for
a
moment
as
he
pass
through
the
hall
,
I
be
certain
I
be
not
mistaken
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
all
my
waiter
will
recognise
him
,
as
well
as
the
Baron
Stolmuyer
of
Saltzburgh
,
who
be
stay
with
me
,
and
who
no
doubt
know
very
well
who
he
be
,
for
he
go
out
with
him
late
and
come
home
alone
,
and
I
order
one
of
my
man
to
wait
up
all
night
in
order
to
let
in
this
very
person
who
be
now
lie
dead
before
us
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
deuce
you
do
!
<EOS>
but
you
do
not
suppose
the
baron
murder
him
,
do
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
mystery
to
me
altogether
--
quite
a
profound
mystery
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
unlikely
,
certainly
;
and
what
be
the
most
extraordinary
part
of
the
whole
affair
be
,
how
the
deuce
could
he
come
into
one
of
the
ice
-
well
belong
to
Anderbury
House
.
<EOS>
that
be
what
puzzle
me
altogether
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
it
will
all
come
out
,
I
hope
,
at
the
inquest
,
which
be
to
be
hold
at
four
o'clock
to
day
.
<EOS>
there
must
have
be
foul
play
somewhere
,
but
the
mystery
be
where
,
and
that
Heaven
only
know
,
perhaps
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
attend
,
"
say
the
landlord
,
"
of
course
,
to
identify
him
;
and
I
suppose
,
unless
anybody
claim
the
horse
,
I
may
as
well
keep
possession
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
flatter
yourself
that
you
will
get
the
horse
out
of
the
transaction
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
know
quite
well
that
the
government
take
possession
of
everything
as
do
not
belong
to
nobody
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
;
but
I
have
get
him
,
and
possession
,
you
know
,
be
nine
point
of
the
law
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
so
;
but
their
tenth
point
will
get
the
well
of
you
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
You
take
my
word
for
it
,
the
horse
will
be
claim
of
you
;
but
I
do
not
mind
,
as
an
old
acquaintance
,
put
you
up
to
a
dodge
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
in
what
way
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
will
tell
you
what
happen
with
a
friend
of
mine

do
not
think
it
be
me
for
if
it
be
I
would
tell
you
at
once
<EOS>
,
so
do
not
think
it
.
<EOS>
He
keep
a
country
public
-
house
;
and
,
one
day
,
an
elderly
gentleman
come
in
,
and
appear
to
be
unwell
.
<EOS>
He
just
utter
a
word
or
two
,
and
then
drop
down
dead
.
<EOS>
He
happen
to
have
in
his
fob
a
gold
repeater
,
that
be
worth
,
at
least
a
hundred
guinea
,
and
my
friend
,
before
anybody
come
,
take
it
out
,
and
pop
in
,
in
its
stead
,
an
old
watch
that
he
have
,
which
be
not
worth
a
couple
of
pound
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
run
a
risk
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
;
but
it
turn
out
very
well
,
because
the
old
gentleman
happen
to
be
a
very
eccentric
person
,
and
be
live
alone
,
so
that
his
friend
really
do
not
know
what
he
have
,
or
what
he
have
not
,
but
take
it
for
<EOS>
grant
that
any
watch
produce
belong
to
him

so
,
if
I
be
you
in
this
case
,
when
the
gentleman
's
horse
be
claim
.
<EOS>
I
would
get
the
d

old
screw
I
could
,

let
them
have
that
.

<EOS>
"
You
would
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
would
I
,

glory
in
it

too

as
the
very
good

could

<EOS>
now
,
a

use

you

<EOS>
"
I
believe
ye
,
it
be

exactly
;

what
be
the
use

it
to
government

<EOS>

,
what
be
more
,
if
it
go
to
the
government
,
there
may
be
some
excuse
;
but
the
government
will
know
no
more
about
it

make
not
so
much
as
I
shall
.
<EOS>
some
Jack

in

office
will
lay
hold
of
it
as
a
thing
of
course

a
perquisite
,
when
you

just
as
well
,

better

keep
it
yourself

do
you
some
good

you

none
to
them

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
it
;
it
be
a
good
and
a
happy
thought

<EOS>
there
be
no
reason
on
earth
why
I
should
not

I
will

it

well

I

be
worth

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
fifty

sixty
guinea
value

"
 
<EOS>
"
then
very
good

then
,
when
the
affair

settle

trouble
you

twenty

You
?

yes

to
be
sure

who

you

one
be
enough
,
be
not
it
,
at
a
time
;

I
think
,
after
give
you
such
advice
as
I
have
,
that
I
be
entitle
,
at
all
event
,
to
something
.

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
,

the
landlord

hotel

I
have
alter
my

will
not

<EOS>
"
very
good
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
;
only
mind
,
if
you
do
,
I
be
down
upon
you
like
a
shot

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
excitement
contingent
upon
the
inquest
be
very
great
;
indeed
,
the
large
room
in
the
public
-
house
,
where
it
be
hold
,
be
crowd
to
suffocation
with
person
who
be
anxious
to
be
present
at
the
proceeding
.
<EOS>
when
the
landlord
reach
home
,
of
course
he
tell
his
guest
,
the
baron
,
of
the
discovery
he
have
make
,
that
the
murdered
man
be
the
strange
visitor
of
the
previous
night
;
for
now
,
from
the
frightful
wound
he
have
receive
in
his
throat
,
the
belief
that
he
be
murder
become
too
rational
a
one
to
admit
of
any
doubt
,
and
be
that
which
be
universally
adopt
in
preference
to
any
other
suggestion
upon
the
occasion
;
although
,
no
doubt
,
people
would
be
find
who
would
not
scruple
to
aver
that
he
have
cut
his
own
throat
,
after
make
his
way
into
the
well
belong
to
Anderbury
House
.
 
<EOS>
the
landlord
have
his
own
misgiving
concern
his
guest
,
the
baron
,
now
that
something
have
occur
of
such
an
awful
and
mysterious
a
nature
to
one
who
be
evidently
know
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
seem
to
be
a
pleasant
thing
to
have
such
an
intimate
friend
of
a
man
who
have
be
murder
in
one
's
house
,
especially
when
it
come
to
be
consider
that
he
be
the
last
person
see
in
his
company
,
and
that
,
consequently
,
he
be
peculiarly
call
upon
to
give
an
explanation
of
how
,
and
under
what
circumstance
,
he
have
part
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
baron
be
sit
smoking
in
the
most
unconcerned
manner
in
the
world
,
when
the
landlord
come
to
bring
him
this
intelligence
,
and
,
when
he
have
hear
him
to
an
end
,
the
remark
he
make
<EOS>
was,--
 
<EOS>
"
really
,
you
very
much
surprise
me
;
but
,
perhaps
,
as
you
be
better
acquaint
with
the
town
than
I
be
,
you
can
tell
me
who
he
be
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
sir
,
that
be
what
we
hope
you
would
be
able
to
tell
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
should
I
tell
you
?
<EOS>
He
introduce
himself
to
me
as
a
Mr.
Mitchell
,
a
surveyor
,
and
he
say
that
,
hear
I
talk
of
purchase
or
rent
Anderbury
-
on
-
the
-
Mount
,
he
come
to
tell
me
that
the
principal
side
wall
,
that
you
could
see
from
the
beach
,
be
off
the
perpendicular
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
and
as
this
be
a
very
interesting
circumstance
to
me
,
consider
that
I
really
do
contemplate
such
a
purchase
or
renting
,
and
do
so
still
,
as
it
be
a
moonlight
night
,
and
he
say
he
could
show
me
in
a
minute
what
he
mean
if
I
would
accompany
him
,
I
do
so
;
but
when
we
get
there
,
and
on
the
road
,
I
hear
quite
enough
of
him
to
convince
me
that
he
be
a
little
out
of
his
sense
,
and
,
consequently
,
I
pay
no
more
attention
to
what
he
say
,
but
walk
home
and
leave
him
on
the
beach
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
most
extraordinary
circumstance
,
sir
;
there
be
no
such
person
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
as
Mitchell
,
a
surveyor
,
in
the
town
;
so
I
can
not
make
it
out
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
I
tell
you
,
I
consider
the
man
out
of
his
sense
,
and
perhaps
that
may
account
for
the
whole
affair
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
sir
,
that
would
,
certainly
;
but
still
,
it
be
a
very
odd
thing
,
because
we
do
not
know
of
such
a
person
at
all
,
and
it
do
seem
so
extraordinary
that
he
should
have
make
his
appearance
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
in
this
sort
of
way
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
sir
,
that
you
will
attend
the
inquest
,
now
,
that
be
to
be
hold
upon
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
;
I
have
no
objection
<EOS>
whatever
to
that
;
indeed
,
I
feel
myself
bind
to
do
so
,
because
I
suppose
mine
be
the
late
evidence
that
can
be
at
all
produce
concern
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
unquestionably
,
sir
;
our
coroner
be
a
very
clever
man
,
and
you
will
be
glad
to
know
him
--
very
glad
to
know
him
,
sir
,
and
he
will
be
glad
to
know
you
,
so
I
be
sure
it
will
be
a
mutual
gratification
.
<EOS>
It
be
at
four
o'clock
the
inquest
be
to
be
,
and
I
dare
say
,
sir
,
if
you
be
there
by
half
-
past
,
it
will
be
time
enough
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
doubt
of
that
;
but
I
will
be
punctual
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
We
have
already
say
the
room
in
which
the
inquest
be
to
be
hold
be
crowd
almost
to
suffocation
,
and
not
only
be
that
the
case
,
but
the
low
part
of
the
house
be
cram
with
people
likewise
;
and
there
can
be
very
little
doubt
but
the
baron
would
have
shrink
from
such
an
investigation
from
a
number
of
curious
eye
,
if
he
could
have
do
so
;
while
the
landlord
of
the
house
would
have
have
no
objection
,
as
far
as
his
profit
be
concern
in
the
sale
of
a
great
quantity
of
beer
and
spirit
,
to
have
have
such
an
occurrence
every
day
in
the
week
,
if
possible
.
 
<EOS>
the
body
lie
still
in
the
shell
where
it
have
be
originally
place
.
<EOS>
after
it
have
be
view
by
the
jury
,
and
almost
every
one
have
remark
upon
the
extraordinary
fresh
appearance
it
wear
,
they
proceed
at
once
to
the
inquiry
,
and
the
first
witness
who
appear
be
Mr.
Leek
,
who
depose
to
have
be
in
company
with
some
gentleman
view
Anderbury
House
,
and
to
have
find
the
body
in
one
of
the
ice
-
well
of
that
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
this
evidence
be
corroborate
by
that
of
Davis
,
who
have
so
unexpectedly
jump
into
the
well
,
without
be
aware
that
it
contain
already
so
disagreeable
a
visitor
as
it
do
in
the
person
of
the
murder
man
,
regard
the
cause
of
whose
death
the
present
inquiry
be
institute
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
landlord
identify
the
body
as
that
of
a
gentleman
who
have
come
to
his
house
on
horseback
,
and
who
have
afterwards
walk
out
with
Baron
Stolmuyer
of
Saltzburgh
,
who
be
one
of
his
guest
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
that
gentleman
in
attendance
?
"
say
the
coroner
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
he
be
;
I
tell
him
about
it
,
and
he
have
kindly
come
forward
to
give
all
the
evidence
in
his
power
concern
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
general
expression
of
interest
and
curiosity
when
the
baron
step
forward
,
attire
in
his
magnificent
coat
,
trim
with
fur
,
and
tender
his
evidence
to
the
coroner
,
which
,
of
course
,
be
precisely
the
same
as
the
statement
he
have
make
to
the
landlord
of
the
house
;
for
,
as
he
have
make
up
such
a
well
connected
story
,
he
be
not
likely
to
prevaricate
or
to
depart
from
it
in
the
small
particular
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
listen
to
with
breathless
attention
,
and
,
when
he
have
conclude
,
the
coroner
,
with
a
preparatory
hem
!
<EOS>
say
to
him
,
 
"
<EOS>
and
you
have
reason
to
suppose
,
sir
,
that
this
person
be
out
of
his
sense
?

"
 
<EOS>
"
It
seem
to
me
so
;
he
talk
wildly
and
incoherently
,
and
in
such
a
manner
as
to
fully
induce
such
a
belief
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
leave
him
on
the
beach
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
find
when
I
get
there
that
it
be
only
a
very
small
portion
,
indeed
,
of
Anderbury
House
that
be
visible
;
and
,
although
the
moon
shine
brightly
,
I
must
confess
I
do
not
see
,
myself
,
any
sign
of
deviation
from
the
perpendicular
;
and
,
such
be
the
case
,
I
leave
the
spot
at
once
,
because
I
could
have
no
further
motive
in
stay
;
and
,
moreover
,
it
be
not
pleasant
to
be
out
at
night
with
a
man
whom
I
think
be
derange
.
<EOS>
I
regret
,
after
make
this
discovery
,
that
I
have
come
from
home
on
such
a
fool
's
errand
;
but
as
,
when
one
be
go
to
invest
a
considerable
sum
of
money
in
any
enterprise
,
one
be
naturally
anxious
to
know
all
about
it
<EOS>
,
I
go
,
little
suspecting
that
the
man
be
insane
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
see
him
after
that
?
<EOS>
"
 
"
certainly
not
,
until
to
-
day
,
when
I
recognise
in
the
body
that
have
be
exhibit
to
me
the
same
individual
.
"
 
"
Gentlemen
,
"
say
the
coroner
to
the
jury
,
"
it
appear
to
me
that
this
be
a
most
mysterious
affair
;
the
deceased
person
have
a
wound
in
his
throat
,
which
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
you
will
hear
from
a
medical
witness
have
be
the
cause
of
death
;
and
the
most
singular
part
of
the
affair
be
,
how
,
if
he
inflict
it
upon
himself
,
he
have
manage
to
dispose
of
the
weapon
with
which
he
do
the
deed
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
last
person
see
in
his
company
,
"
say
one
of
the
jury
,
"
be
the
baron
,
and
I
think
he
be
bind
to
give
some
well
explanation
of
the
affair
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
yet
to
discover
,
"
say
the
baron
,
"
that
the
last
person
who
acknowledge
to
have
be
in
the
company
of
a
man
afterwards
murder
,
must
,
of
necessity
,
be
the
murderer
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
but
how
do
you
account
,
sir
,
for
there
be
no
weapon
find
by
which
the
man
could
have
do
the
deed
himself
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
account
for
it
at
all
--
how
do
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
irregular
,
"
say
the
coroner
;
"
call
the
next
witness
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
medical
man
,
who
briefly
state
that
he
have
see
the
deceased
,
and
that
the
wound
in
his
throat
be
amply
sufficient
to
account
for
his
death
;
that
it
be
inflict
with
a
sharp
instrument
have
an
edge
on
each
side
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
then
,
seem
to
conclude
the
case
,
and
the
coroner
remarked,--
 
<EOS>
"
gentleman
of
the
jury,--i
think
this
be
one
of
those
peculiar
case
in
which
an
open
verdict
be
necessary
,
or
else
an
adjournment
without
date
,
so
that
the
matter
can
be
resume
at
any
time
,
if
fresh
evidence
can
be
procure
concern
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
one
accuse
of
the
offence
,
although
it
appear
to
me
impossible
that
the
unhappy
man
could
have
commit
the
act
himself
.
<EOS>
We
have
no
reason
to
throw
the
least
shade
of
suspicion
or
doubt
upon
the
evidence
of
the
Baron
Stolmuyer
of
Saltzburgh
;
for
as
far
as
we
know
anything
of
the
matter
,
the
murdered
man
may
have
be
in
the
company
of
a
dozen
people
after
the
baron
leave
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
a
desultory
conversation
ensue
,
which
end
in
an
adjournment
of
the
inquest
,
without
any
future
day
be
mention
for
its
re
-
assemble
,
and
so
the
Baron
Stolmuyer
entirely
escape
from
what
may
have
be
a
very
serious
affair
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
do
not
,
however
,
appear
to
shake
him
in
his
resolution
of
take
Anderbury
-
on
-
the
-
Mount
,
although
Mr.
Leek
very
much
fear
it
would
;
but
he
announce
to
that
gentleman
his
intention
fully
of
do
so
,
and
tell
him
to
get
the
necessary
paper
draw
up
forthwith
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
he
say
,
"
within
a
few
week
'
time
to
be
fairly
instal
in
that
mansion
,
<EOS>
and
then
I
will
trouble
you
,
Mr.
Leek
,
to
give
me
a
list
of
the
name
of
all
the
good
family
in
the
neighbourhood
;
for
I
intend
give
an
entertainment
on
a
grand
scale
in
the
mansion
and
ground
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
Mr.
Leek
,
"
I
shall
,
with
the
great
pleasure
,
attend
upon
you
in
every
possible
way
in
this
affair
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
very
excellent
neighbourhood
,
and
you
will
have
no
difficulty
,
I
assure
you
,
sir
,
in
get
together
an
extremely
capital
and
creditable
assemblage
of
person
.
<EOS>
there
could
not
be
a
well
plan
devise
for
at
once
introduce
all
the
people
who
be
worth
know
,
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
,
"
say
the
baron
;
"
I
think
the
place
will
suit
me
well
;
and
,
as
the
Baroness
Stolmuyer
of
Saltzburgh
be
dead
,
I
have
some
idea
of
marry
again
;
and
therefore
it
become
necessary
and
desirable
that
I
should
be
well
acquaint
with
the
surround
family
of
distinction
in
this
neighbourhood
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
hint
not
at
all
likely
to
be
throw
away
upon
Mr.
Leek
,
who
be
the
grand
gossip
-
monger
of
the
place
,
and
he
treasure
it
up
in
order
to
see
if
he
could
not
make
something
of
it
which
would
be
advantageous
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
quite
enough
of
the
select
and
fashionable
family
in
that
neighbourhood
,
to
be
fully
aware
that
neither
the
baron
's
age
nor
his
ugliness
would
be
any
bar
to
his
form
a
matrimonial
alliance
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
not
one
of
them
,
"
he
say
to
himself
,
"
who
would
not
marry
the
very
devil
himself
and
be
call
the
Countess
Lucifer
,
or
any
name
of
the
kind
,
always
provide
there
be
plenty
of
money
:
and
that
the
baron
have
without
doubt
,
so
it
be
equally
without
doubt
he
may
pick
and
choose
where
he
please
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
quite
correct
of
Mr.
Leek
,
and
show
his
great
knowledge
of
human
nature
;
and
we
entertain
with
him
a
candid
opinion
,
that
if
the
Baron
Stolmuyer
of
Saltzburgh
have
be
ten
time
as
ugly
as
he
be
,
and
Heaven
know
that
be
needless
,
he
may
pick
and
choose
a
wife
almost
when
he
please
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
general
rule
;
and
as
,
of
course
,
to
all
general
rule
there
be
exception
,
this
one
can
not
be
suppose
to
be
free
from
them
.
<EOS>
under
all
circumstance
,
and
in
all
class
of
society
,
there
be
single
-
minded
being
who
consult
the
pure
dictate
of
their
own
heart
,
and
who
,
disdain
those
thing
which
make
up
the
amount
of
the
ambition
of
meaner
spirit
,
stand
aloof
as
bright
and
memorable
example
to
the
rest
of
human
nature
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
being
be
Flora
Bannerworth
.
<EOS>
She
would
never
have
be
find
to
sacrifice
herself
to
the
fancy
advantage
of
wealth
and
station
,
but
would
have
give
her
heart
and
hand
to
the
true
object
of
her
affection
,
although
a
sovereign
prince
have
make
the
endeavour
to
wean
her
from
it
.
