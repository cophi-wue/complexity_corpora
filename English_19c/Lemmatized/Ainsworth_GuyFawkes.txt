the
revolting

sanguinary
spectacle
just

<EOS>
many

who
condemn
—

the
majority
do
so
—
the
extreme
severity
of
the
law
by
which
the
unfortunate
priest
have
just
suffer
,
utter
their
sentiment
with
extreme
caution
;
but
there
be
some
whose
feeling
have
be
too
much
excited
for
prudence
,
and
who
inveigh
loudly
and
bitterly
against
the
spirit
of
religious
persecution

prevail
;
while
a
few
other
of
an
entirely
opposite
persuasion
look
upon
the
rigorous
proceeding
adopt
against
the
Papists
,
and
the
punishment
now
inflict
upon
their
priesthood
,
as
a
just
retribution
for
their

severity
during
the
reign
of
Mary

<EOS>
in
general
,
the
common
people
entertain
a
strong
prejudice
against
the
catholic
party,—for
,
as
it
have
be
shrewdly
observe
,
"
they
must
have
some
object
to
hate
;
heretofore
it
be
the
Welsh
,
the
Scots
,
or
the
Spaniards
,
but
now
in
these
latter

only
the
Papists

as

so
many
old

important
family

reside
<EOS>
,
the
case
be
widely
different
;
and
the
mass
of
the
inhabitant
be
favourably
inclined
towards
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
knowledge
of
this
feeling
that
induce
the
commissioner
,
appoint
to
superintend
the
execution
of
the
enactment
against
recusant
,
to
proceed
with
unusual
rigour
in
this
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
the
state
of
the
Roman
Catholic
party
at
the
period
of
this
history
be
indeed
most
grievous
.
<EOS>
the
hope
they
have
indulge
of
great
toleration
on
the
accession

First

the
persecution
,
suspend
during
the
first
year
of
the
reign
of
the
new
monarch
,
be
now
renew
with
great
severity
than
ever
;
and
though
their
present
condition
be
deplorable
enough
,
it
be
fear
that
bad
remain
in
store
for
them
.
<EOS>
"
They
bethought
themselves
,
"
write
Bishop
Goodman
,
"
that
now
their
case
be
far
bad
than
in
the
time
of
Queen
Elizabeth
;
for
they
do
live
in
some
hope
that
after
the
old
woman
's
life
,
they
may
have
some
mitigation
,
and
even
those
who
do
then
persecute
them
be
a
little
more
moderate
,
as
be
doubtful
what
time
may
succeed
,

fear
their
own
case
.
<EOS>
but
,
now
that
they
see
the
time
settle
,
have
no
hope
of
well
day
,
but
expect
that
the
uttermost
rigour
of
the
law
should
be
execute
,
they
become
desperate
:
find
that
by
the
law
of
the
kingdom
their
own
life
be
not
secure
,
and
for
the
carrying
over
of
a
priest
into
England
it
be
no
less
than
high
treason
.
<EOS>
a

what

this
the

take
away
from

their

they

die

once

their

be
more
precious
unto

than
their

They

consider
their

how

They

citizens,—they
could
have
no

they

not
breed
up
their

none

they
have
neither
fit
marriage
for
their

into
;
for
those
few
which
be
beyond

be
not
considerable
in

of
the
number
of
recusant

and
none
can
be
admit
into
them
without
great
sum
of
money
,
which
they

<EOS>
the
Spiritual

to
excommunicate

thereby
they

such

First

press
down

that

among

when

should

redress
by
dark

<EOS>
by

a

of
twenty

a

on
the

of
the

again
exact
,
and
all

claim
.
<EOS>
add
to
this
,
James
,
whose

by
a
host
of

scottish
retainer
,
assign
to

a
certain
number
of
wealthy
recusant
,
and
empower
them
to
levy
the
fine
—
a
privilege
of
which
they
be
not
slow
to
avail
themselves
.
<EOS>
there
be
other
pain

<EOS>
to
withdraw

to
withdraw

be
account
high

to

of

fall
back
upon

resolve
upon
the
execution

a
dark

dreadful
project

he
have
long
conceive

which
he
could
execute
almost

without

as
it

to
the
complete
success
of
the
conspiracy
that
its
outbreak
should
be
instantaneously
follow
by
a
rise
on
the
part

he
darkly
hint
that
a
plan
be
on
foot
for
their
deliverance
from
the
yoke
of
their
oppressor

counsel
them
to
hold
themselves
in

fly
to

here
again

Himself

the

who
,
though
unwilling

at

period
of
so
much
danger
,
or
to
commit
his

to
any

his

even
for
so
short
a

though

he
have

the
contrary

it
may
be
doubt
whether

whether
his

thus
much
in

what

the

<EOS>
Hitherto
Viviana
have
remain
silent

<EOS>
though
fully
aware
of
the
risk
she
have
run
,
she
give
no
sign
of
alarm
—
not
even
when
the
blow

"You

Guy

in

her
speech

that
it

deceive
you

<EOS>
Our
foe
be

near
us
,

well
mounted
,
to
make
it
by
any
mean
certain
we
shall
escape
them,—unless

<EOS>
""they

Humphrey

fearfully
backwards

<EOS>
"
They

""my

""if

observe
Guy

,
significantly
.
<EOS>
the

notion
,
almost
at
the

moment
,
occur
to
the
pursuivant
.
<EOS>
have
witness
the
prowess
display
by
Guy
Fawkes
in
his
recent
attack
on
the
soldier
,
he
feel
no
disposition
to
encounter
so
formidable
an
opponent
single

handed
;
and
find
that
the
high

mettle
barb
on
which
he
be
mount
,
by
its
superior
speed
and
fiery
temper
,
would
inevitably
place
him
in
such
a
dilemma
,
he
prudently
resolve
to
halt
,
and
exchange
it
for
a
more
manageable
steed
.
<EOS>
this
delay
be
of
great
service
to
the
fugitive
,
and
enable
them
to
get
considerably
ahead
.
<EOS>
They
have
now
gain
a
narrow
lane
,
and
,
track
it
,
speedily
reach
the
rocky
bank
of
the
Irwell
.
<EOS>
gallop
along
a
foot

path
that
follow
the
serpentine
course
of
the
stream
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile

they
arrive
at
a
spot
mark
by
a
bed
of
osier
,
where
Humphrey
Chetham
inform
them
there
be
a
ford
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
they
plunge
into
the
river
,
and
while
stem
the
current
,
which
here
run
with
great
swiftness
,
and
rise
up
above
the
saddle
,
the
neighing
of
a
steed
be
hear
from
the
bank
they
have
quit
.
<EOS>
turn
at
the
sound
,
Viviana
behold
her
favourite
courser
on
the
summit
of
a
high
rock
.
<EOS>
the
soldier
to
whom
Zayda
be
intrust
have
speedily
,
as
the
pursuivant
foresaw
,
distance
his
companion
,
and
choose
this
elevated
position
to
take
sure
aim
at
Guy
Fawkes
,
against
whom
he
be
now
level
a
caliver
.
<EOS>
the
next
moment
a
bullet
strike
against
his
brigandine
,
but
without
do
him
any
injury
.
<EOS>
the
soldier
,
however
,
do
not
escape
so
lightly
.
<EOS>
startle
by
the
discharge
,
the
fiery
barb
leap
from
the
precipice
into
the
river

and
throw
her
rider
,
who

off

swam
towards
the
opposite
bank
,
which
she
reach
just
as
the

<EOS>
at
the
sound
of
her
mistress
's
voice
she
stand
still
,
and
allow
Humphrey
Chetham
to
lay
hold
of
her
bridle
;
and
Viviana
declaring
she
be
able
to
mount
her
,
Guy

who
feel
that
such
an
arrangement
be
most
likely
to
conduce
to
her
safety

and
who
be
,
moreover
,
inclined
to
view
the
occurrence
as
a
providential
interference
in
their
behalf

immediately
assist
her
into
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
before
this
transfer
could
be
effect
,
the
pursuivant
and
his
attendant
have
begin
to
ford
the
stream
.
<EOS>
the
former
have
witness
the
accident
that
have
befall
the
soldier
from
a
short
distance
;
and
,
while
he
affect
to
deplore
it
,
internally
congratulate
himself
on
his
prudence
and
foresight
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
by
no

so
well
satisfied
when
he
see
how
it
serve

<EOS>
"that

"
<EOS>
he

<EOS>
"
some
fiend
must
have
prompt

Would

<EOS>
with

Miss

no

secure
Father

I

I

<EOS>
I
will
hang
them
both
on
a
gibbet
high
than
Haman's

<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
mutter
other
threat
to
the
same
effect
,
he
pick
his
way
to
the
opposite
shore
.
<EOS>
long
before
he
reach
it
,
the
fugitive
have
disappear
;
but
on
climb
the
bank

he
behold
them
gallop
swiftly
across
a
well

woode
district
steep
in
moonlight
,
and
spread
out
before
his
view
,
and
inflame
by
the
sight

shout
to
his

once
more
start
in
pursuit

by
the
fortunate
incident
above

which
,
in

her
with
her
own

in
a
manner
so
surprising

her
assurance

who
ever

cast
an
anxious
look
behind

to
ascertain
the
distance
of
their
pursuer

but
suffer
no
exclamation
to
escape
his
lip
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
throughout
the
whole
affair
,
he
maintain
the
reserve
belong
to
his
sombre
and
taciturn
character
,
and
neither
question

Chetham
as

where
he

nor

any
deviation
from
the
route
he
have

<EOS>
to
such
remark
as
be
address
to
him
,
Fawkes
answer
in
monosyllable
;
and
it
be
only
when
occasion
require
,
that
he
volunteer
any
observation
or
advice
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
surrender
himself
to
chance
.
<EOS>
and
perhaps
,
if
his
bosom
could
have
be
examine
,
it
would
have
be
find
that
he
consider
himself
a
mere
puppet
in
the
hand
of
destiny

<EOS>
in

they

Humphrey

still

and
,
impose
silence
upon
the
other

listen
to
the
approach
of
their
pursuer

<EOS>
His
prediction
be
speedily
and
terribly
verified

<EOS>
hear
the
movement
in
advance
,
but
unable

discover
the
course

by
the
fugitive
,
the
unfortunate
soldier
,
fearful
of
lose
their
prey
,
quicken
their

in
the
expectation

them

<EOS>
They

fatally
undeceived

<EOS>
four
only
of
their
number
,
besides
their
leader
,
remained,—two
<EOS>
have
perish
in
the
manner

.
<EOS>
the
first
of
these
,
disregard
the
caution
of
his
comrade
,
laughingly
urge
his
horse
into
a
gallop
,
and
,
on
pass
the
mark
,
sink
as
if
by
magic
,
and
before
he
could
utter
a
single
warning
cry
,
into
the
depth
of
the
morass
.
<EOS>
His
disappearance
be
so
instantaneous
,
that
the
next
in

,
though
he
hear
the
sullen
plunge
,
be
unable
to
draw
in
the
rein
,
and
be
likewise
ingulfe

<EOS>
a
third
follow
;
and
a
fourth
,
in
his
effort
to
avoid
their
fate
,
back
his
steed
over
the
slippery
edge
of
the
path

<EOS>
only
one
now
remain

<EOS>
It
be
the
pursuivant

who
,
with
the
prudence
that
characterize
all
his

have
follow
in

<EOS>
He
be
so
dreadfully
frightened
,
<EOS>
that
,
add
his
shriek
to
those
of
his
attendant
,
he
shout
to
the
fugitive
,
implore
assistance
in
the
most
piteous
term
,
and
promise
never
again
to
molest
them
,
if
they
would
guide
him
to
a
place
of
safety
.
<EOS>
but
his
cry
be
wholly
unheeded
;
and
he
perhaps
endure
in
those
few
minute
of
agony
as
much
suffering
as
he
have
inflict
on
the
numerous
victim
of
his
barbarity
.
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
an
appalling
moment
.
<EOS>
three

the
wretched
man

not
yet
sink

but
be
flounder
about
in
the
swamp

help

<EOS>

as
much
terrified
as

their
piercing
cry

the
half

suffocate

as
if

make
the
scene
more
ghastly

myriad
of
dancing
light

towards
them

throw
an
unearthly
glimmer
over

part

by
compassion

the
poor
wretch

Humphrey

moment

during
which

utter
the

frightful
cry

to
keep
his
head
above
the
swamp

<EOS>
His
effort
be
tremendous
,
but
unavaile
,
and
serve

to
accelerate
his

<EOS>
on
hear
their
departure

the
pursuivant
renew
his
cry
in

in

the
entreaty
of

nothing

induce

to
lend
him
assistance

for

they
proceed
in

without

Viviana

first
impulse
be

give

for
their
deliverance

nor
do

omit
in

prayer
a
supplication

on

they
could
scarcely

their

on
find
that
there

they
be
meet
by

who
inform

that
their

<EOS>
from
that
night
Doctor

<EOS>
at
the
period
of

a
long

the
then
popular
science
of

and
other
occult
learning

<EOS>
so
accurate
be
his
calculation
esteem
,
that
he
be
universally
consult
as
an
oracle

<EOS>
for
some
time
,
he

in
Germany
,
where
he

<EOS>
on

of
the
youthful

<EOS>
this

<EOS>
Dee
share
the
common
fate
of
all

<EOS>
His
next
patron
be
Lord
Robert
Dudley
(
afterwards
the
celebrated
Earl
of
Leicester
)
,
who
,
it
be
well
-
know
,
be
a
firm
believer
in
the
superstitious
art
to
which
Dee
be
addict
,
and
by
whom
he
be
employ
,
on
the
accession
of
Elizabeth
,
to
erect
a
scheme
to
ascertain
the
good
day
for
her
coronation
.
<EOS>
His
prediction
be
so
fortunate
that
it
procure
him
the
favour
of
the
Queen
,
from
whom
he
receive
many
mark
of
regard
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
not
needful
to
follow
him
through
his
various
wandering
,
it
may
be
sufficient
to
mention
,
that
in
1564
he
proceed
to
Germany
on
a
visit
to
the
Emperor
Maximilian
,
to
whom
he
dedicate
his
"
Monas
Hieroglyphica
;
"
that
in
1571
he
fall
grievously
sick
in
Lorrain
,
whither
two
physician
be
despatch
to
his
aid
by
Elizabeth
;
and
that
on
his
recovery
he
return
to
his
own
country
,
and
retire
to
Mortlake
,
where
he
gather
together
a
vast
library
,
comprise
the
rare
and
most
curious
work
on
all
science
,
together
with
a
large
collection
of
manuscript
.
<EOS>
while
thus
live
in
retirement
,
he
be
seek
out
by
Edward
Kelley
,
a
native
of
Worcestershire
,
who
represent
himself
as
in
possession
of
an
old
book
of
magic
,
contain
form
of
invocation
,
by
which
spirit
may
be
summon
and
control
,
as
well
as
a
ball
of
ivory
,
find
in
the
tomb
of
a
bishop
who
have
make
great
progress
in
hermetic
philosophy
,
which
be
fill
with
the
powder
of
projection
.
<EOS>
these
treasure
Kelley
offer
to
place
in
the
hand
of
the
Doctor
on
certain
condition
,
which
be
immediately
acquiesce
in
,
and
thenceforth
Kelley
become
a
constant
inmate
in
his
house
,
and
an
assistant
in
all
his
practice
.
<EOS>
shortly
afterwards
,
they
be
join
by
a
polish
nobleman
,
Albert
de
Laski
,
Palatine
of
Suabia
,
whom
they
accompany
to
Prague
,
at
the
instance
of
the
Emperor
Rodolph
the
second
,
who
desire
to
be
initiate
into
their
mystery
.
<EOS>
Their
reception
at
this
court
be
not
such
as
to
induce
a
long
sojourn
at
it
;
and
Dee
have
be
warn
by
his
familiar
spirit
to
sell
his
effect
and
depart
,
comply
with
the
intimation
,
and
remove
to
Poland
.
<EOS>
the
same
fate
attend
him
here
.
<EOS>
the
nuncio
of
the
Pope
denounce
him
as
a
sorcerer
,
and
demand
that
he
should
be
deliver
up
to
the
Inquisition
.
<EOS>
this
be
refuse
by
the
monarch
;
but
Dee
and
his
companion
be
banish
from
his
dominion
,
and
compel
to
fly
to
Bohemia
,
where
they
take
refuge
in
the
castle
of
Trebona
,
belong
to
Count
Rosenberg
.
<EOS>
shortly
afterwards
,
Dee
and
Kelley
separate
,
the
magical
instrument
be
deliver
to
the
former
,
who
bend
his
course
homeward
;
and
on
his
arrival
in
London
be
warmly
welcome
by
the
Queen
.
<EOS>
during
his
absence
,
his
house
at
Mortlake
have
be
break
open
by
the
populace
,
under
the
pretence
of
its
be
the
abode
of
a
wizard
,
and
rifle
of
its
valuable
library
and
manuscripts,—a
loss
severely
feel
by
its
owner
.
<EOS>
some
year
be
now
pass
by
Dee
in
great
destitution
,
during
which
he
prosecute
his
study
with
the
same
ardour
as
before
,
until
at
length
in
1595
,
when
he
be
turn
seventy
,
fortune
again
smile
upon
him
,
and
he
be
appoint
to
the
wardenship
of
the
College
at
Manchester
,
whither
he
repair
,
and
be
instal
in
great
pomp
.
<EOS>
but
his
residence
in
this
place
be
not
destine
to
be
a
tranquil
one
.
<EOS>
His
reputation
as
a
dealer
in
the
black
art
have
precede
him
,
and
render
him
obnoxious
to
the
clergy
,
with
whom
he
have
constant
dispute
,
and
a
feud
subsist
between
him
and
the
fellow
of
his
church
.
<EOS>
It
have
already
be
mention
that
he
refuse
to
occupy
the
house
allot
him
,
but
prefer
take
up
his
quarter
in
the
old
dilapidated
College
.
<EOS>
various
reason
be
assign
by
his
enemy
for
this
singular
choice
of
abode
.
<EOS>
They
affirm
—
and
with
some
reason
—
that
he
select
it
because
he
desire
to
elude
observation,—and
that
his
mode
of
life
,
sufficiently
improper
in
a
layman
,
be
altogether
indecorous
in
an
ecclesiastic
.
<EOS>
by
the
common
people
he
be
universally
regard
as
a
conjuror
—
and
many
at
first
come
to
consult
him
;
but
he
peremptorily
dismiss
all
such
applicant
;
and
,
when
seven
female
,
suppose
to
be
possess
,
be
bring
to
him
that
he
may
exercise
his
power
over
the
evil
spirit
,
he
refuse
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
He
also
publicly
examine
and
rebuke
a
juggler
,
name
Hartley
,
who
pretend
to
magical
knowledge
.
<EOS>
but
these
thing
do
not
blind
his
enemy
,
who
continue
to
harass
him
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
address
a
petition
to
James
the
first
,
entreat
to
be
bring
to
trial

for

she
prayed,—and

at

sound

she
fly
towards

perceive
in

utter

anxiety

recount
the

<EOS>
"It

look
in
the
direction
of
the
speaker
and
beheld
a
man
in
a
priestly
garb
,
whose
countenance
strike
her
forcibly
.
<EOS>
He
be
rather
under
the
middle
height
,
of
a
slight
spare
figure
,
and
in
age
may
be
about
fifty
.
<EOS>
His
feature
,
which
in
his
youth
must
have
be
pleasing
,
if
not
handsome
,
and
which
be
still
regular
,
be
pale
and
emaciated
;
but
his
eye
be
dark
,
and
of
unusual
brilliancy
.
<EOS>
a
single
glance
at
this
person
satisfy
her
it
be
Father
Garnet
,
the
provincial
of
the
English
Jesuits
;
nor
be
she
mistake
in
her
supposition

<EOS>
of
this
remarkable
person
,
so
intimately
connect
with
the
main
event
of
the
history
about
to
be
relate
,
it
may
be
proper
to
offer
some
preliminary
account
.
<EOS>
bear

Nottingham
in
1554

the
reign
of
Queen
Mary
,
and
of
obscure
parentage

the
Protestant
Church

with
a
view
to
take
order

at
Winchester
school
,
whence
<EOS>
it
be
intend
he
should
be
remove
in
due
course
to
Oxford
.
<EOS>
but
this
design
be
never
carry
into
effect
.
<EOS>
influence
by
motive
,
into
which
it
be
now
scarcely
worth
while
inquire
,
and
which
have
be
contest
by
writer
on
both
side
of
the
question
,
Garnet
proceed
from
Winchester
to
London
,
where
he
engage
himself
as
corrector
of
the
press
to
a
printer
of
law
-
book
,
name
Tottel
,
in
which
capacity
he
become
acquaint
with
Sir
Edward
Coke
and
Chief
Justice
Popham,—one
of
whom
be
afterwards
to
be
the
lead
counsel
against
him
,
and
the
other
his
judge
.
<EOS>
after
continue
in
this
employment
for
two
year
,
during
which
he
have
meditate
a
change
in
his
religion
,
he
go
abroad
,
and
travel
first
to
Madrid
,
and
then
to
Rome
,
see
enough
of
the
catholic
priesthood
to
confirm
his
resolution
,
and
in
1575
he
assume
the
habit
of
a
Jesuit
.
<EOS>
pursue
his
study
with
the
utmost
zeal
and
ardour
at
the
Jesuits
'
College
,
under
the
celebrated
Bellarmine
,
and
the
no
less
celebrated
Clavius
,
he
make
such
progress
,
that
upon
the
indisposition
of
the
latter
,
he
be
able
to
fill
the
mathematical
chair
.
<EOS>
nor
be
he
less
skilled
in
philosophy
,
metaphysic
,
and
divinity
;
and
his
knowledge
of
Hebrew
be
so
profound
that
he
teach
it
publicly
in
the
roman
school
.
<EOS>
to
an
enthusiastic
zeal
in
the
cause
of
the
religion
he
have
espouse
,
Garnet
add
great
power
of
persuasion
and
eloquence,—a
combination
of
quality
well
fit
him
for
the
office
of
a
missionary
priest
;
and
undismaye
by
the
danger
he
would
have
to
encounter
,
and
eager
to
propagate
his
doctrine
,
he
solicit
to
be
send
on
this
errand
to
his
own
country
.
<EOS>
at
the
instance
of
Father
Persons
,
he
receive
an
appointment
to
the
mission
in
1586
,
and
he
secretly
land
in
England
in
the
same
year
.
<EOS>
brave
every
danger
,
and
shrink
from
no
labour
,
he
seek
on
all
hand
to
make
proselyte
to
the
ancient
faith
,
and
to
sustain
the
wavering
courage
of
its
professor
.
<EOS>
two
year
afterwards
,
on
the
imprisonment
of
the
Superior
of
the
Jesuits
,
be
raise
to
that
important
post
,
he
be
enable
to
extend
his
sphere
of
action
;
and
redouble
his
exertion
in
consequence
,
he
so
well
discharge
his
duty
,
that
it
be
mainly
owe
to
him
that
the
Catholic
party
be
keep
together
during
the
fierce
persecution
of
the
latter
end
of
Elizabeth
's
reign
.
<EOS>
compel
to
personate
various
character
,
as
he
travel
from
place
to
place
,
Garnet
have
acquire
a
remarkable
facility
for
disguise
;
and
such
be
his
address
and
courage
,
that
he
not
unfrequently
impose
upon
the
very
officer
send
in
pursuit
of
him
.
<EOS>
up
to
the
period
of
Elizabeth
's
demise
,
he
have
escape
arrest
;
and
,
though
involve
in
the
treasonable
intrigue
with
the
king
of
Spain
,
and
other
conspiracy
,
he
procure
a
general
pardon
under
the
great
seal
.
<EOS>
His
office
and
profession
naturally
bring
him
into
contact
with
the
chief
catholic
family
throughout
the
kingdom
;
and
he
maintain
an
active
correspondence
with
many
of
them
,
by
mean
of
his
various
agent
and
emissary
.
<EOS>
the
great
object
of
his
life
be
the
restoration
of
the
fall
religion
,
to
accomplish
this
,
as
he
conceive
,
great
and
desirable
end

he
be
prepared
to
adopt
any
mean
,
however
violent
or
obnoxious
.
<EOS>
when
,
under
the
seal
of
confession
,
Catesby
reveal
to
him
his
dark
design
,
so
far
from
discourage
him
,
all
he
counsel
be
caution
.
<EOS>
have
test
the
disposition
of
the
wealthy
Romanists
to
rise
against
their
oppressor
,
and
find
a
general
insurrection
,
as
have
before
be
state
,
impracticable
,
he
give
every
encouragement
and
assistance
to
the
conspiracy
form
among
the
more
desperate
and
discontent
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
at
his
instigation
,
the
present
pilgrimage
to
Saint
Winifred
's
Well
be
undertake
,
in
the
hope
that
,
when
so
large
a
body
of
the
Catholics
be
collect
together
,
some
additional
aid
to
the
project
may
be
obtain
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
most
mysterious
and
inexplicable
portion
of
Garnet

history
be
that

early
patron
and
friend

the
death
of
her
father

in
1595

attach
herself
to
his
fortunes,—accompanie
him
in
all
his
missions,—share
all
his
privation
and
dangers,—and
,
regardless
of
calumny
or
reproach

devote
herself
entirely
to
his
service

singular
,

who
have
marry

<EOS>
It

striking
sight

such

fairy
architecture

on

he
perceive
Guy

kneel
beside
the
fountain
,
apparently
occupy
in
prayer
;
and
,
be
unwilling
to
disturb
him
,
he
pause
.
<EOS>
Finding
,
however
,
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
minute
,
that
he
do
not
move
,
he
advance
towards
him
,
and
be
about
to
lay
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
when
he
be
arrest
by
the
very
extraordinary
expression
of
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
His
lip
be
partly
open
,
but
perfectly
motionless
,
and
his
eye
,
almost
start
from
their
socket
,
be
fix
upon
the
boiling
water
of
the
spring
.
<EOS>
His
hand
be
clasp
,
and
his
look
altogether
be
that
of
one
whose
faculty
be
benumb
by
awe
or
terror
.
<EOS>
aware
of
the
fanatical
and
enthusiastical
character
of
Fawkes
,
Garnet
have
little
doubt
that
,
by
keep
long
vigil
at
the
fountain
,
he
have
work
himself
into
such
a
state
of
over
-
excitement
as
to
imagine
he
behold
some
preternatural
appearance
;
and
it
be
with
some
curiosity
that
he
await
the
result
.
<EOS>
glance
in
the
same
direction
,
his
eye
rest
upon
the
bottom
of
the
well
,
but
he
could
discern
nothing
except
the
glittering
and
blood
-
streak
pebble
,
and
the
reflection
of
the
early
sunbeam
that
quiver
on
its
steam
surface
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
a
convulsion
pass
over
the
frame
of
the
kneeler
,
and
heave
a
deep
sigh
he
arise
.
<EOS>
turn
to
quit
the
spring
,
he
confront
Garnet
,
and
demand
,
in
<EOS>
a
low
voice—"have
<EOS>
you
likewise

the
vision

make
no
reply
,
but
regard
him
steadfastly
.
<EOS>
"Has

"No

Garnet

<EOS>
listen
to
me
,
father
.
<EOS>
I
come
hither
last
night
to
make
my
couch
beside
the
fountain

<EOS>
after
plunge
into
it
,
I
feel
marvellously
refresh
,
and
dispose
myself
to
rest
on
that
stone
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
have
my
eye
close
when
the
saintly
virgin
appear
to
me
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
father
,
it
be
a
vision
of

Guy

"
I
can
lay
little
claim

the

""Think

""Thus

glide
towards

its
finger
upon

brow
.
<EOS>
My
eye
open
,
but
I
be
as
one

with
a
nightmare

unable
to
move

<EOS>
I
then
think
I
hear
my

pronounce
by
a
voice
so
wondrously
sweet
that
my
sense
be
quite
ravish

<EOS>
Fain
would
I
have

my

refuse
their
office

neither

""Proceed

curious
to

""Father

Guy

"Catesby

the
chamber

the
wound

He
have
regain
his
consciousness

after
such
restorative
as

about

fit
up
with
a

begin
to
ramble
as
before
about
the
conspiracy

fear
his
raving
may
awaken
the
suspicion
of
the
servant

Catesby
would
not
suffer
any
of
them
to
come
near
him

arrange
with
Garnet

keep
watch
over
him
by
turn

by
degree

more
composed

after
doze
a

open
his

him
where
his
stern
nature
be
most

soon
after
this

into
a
slumber

His
sleep
endure
for
some
hour

his
breathing
grow
fainter

fainter

so
that
at
the
last
it
be
scarcely
perceptible

a
strike
change

likewise
take
place

these
sign
convince
Catesby

to
set
out
at

be
overrule

attribute
the
absence

make
no

take

farewell

few
thing
be
as
she
have
know
them

even
in
their

forlorn
state
they
be
dear

her

the
room
she
tread
,
<EOS>
though
dismantle

be
the

she
have
occupy
in

<EOS>
there
be
no
pang
more
acute

Her
emotion

frequently
call
up

arise
from
the
bench
on
which
she
have
throw
herself

proceed
along
a
walk
to
gather
a
few
flower
as
memorial
of

place

further
end

be
stoop
to
pluck
a
spray
of
some
fragrant
shrub

when
she
perceive
the
figure
of
a
man
behind
a
tree
at
a
little
distance
from
her

<EOS>
from
his
garb

which
be
that
of
a
soldier

she
instantly
know
he
be
an
enemy

though
greatly
alarm

she
have
the
courage
not
to
scream

break
off
the
branch

utter

exclamation

start
off
at

the
house

deceive

her
manner

on

the
end

look
back

withdraw

Her
first
step

to
close

her
next
to
hasten
to
Guy

chamber

probability

only
the
arrival
of
night
to

unprepared

<EOS>
Our
only
chance
be
to
steal
out
unobserved
;
for
resistance
would
be
in
vain
,
as
their
force
be
probably
numerous

and
I
be
as
helpless
as
an
infant

while
Father
Garnet

broken
arm
preclude
any
assistance
from

in

through

may
give

retreat

<EOS>
the
contingency
be
by
no
means
improbable

and
it
be
urge
so
strongly
by
Garnet

that
Catesby
begin
to
regret
his
precipitancy
in
send
the

still

the

before

forth
from
their
present
abode

<EOS>
They
have

to
remove
the
rest
of
the
powder
without
loss
of
time
,
but
be
induce
to
defer
their
purpose
on
the
representation
of
Tresham
,
who
state
to
Garnet
,
that
in
his
opinion
they
would
run
a
great
and
needless
risk
.
<EOS>
before
the
expiration
of
a
week
,
Tresham
's
apparent
remorse
for
his
perfidy
,

to
his
seem
zeal
,

so
far

him
in
the
confidence
of
his
associate
,
that
he

fully

of
his
offence
by
Garnet
;
and
,
after
take
fresh
oath
of
even
great
solemnity
than
the
former

again

to
the
league
.
<EOS>
Catesby
,
however
,
who
place
little
faith
in
his
protestation
,
never
lose
sight
of
him
for
an
instant
,
and
,
even
if
he
meditate
an
escape
,
he
have
no
opportunity
of
effect
it
.
<EOS>
a
coldness
,
strong
on
his
side
than
her
,
seem
to
have
arise
between
Viviana
and
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
whenever
she
descend
to
the
low
room
,
he
withdraw
on
some
excuse
;
and
though
he
never
urge
her
departure
by
word
,
his
look
plainly
bespeak
that
he
desire
it
.
<EOS>
upon
one
occasion
,
she
find
him
alone,—the
other
be
at
the
time
within
the
vault

<EOS>
He
be
whet
the
point
of
his
dagger
,
and
do
not
hear
her
approach
,
until
she
stand
beside
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
slightly
confused
,
and
a
deep
ruddy
stain
flush
his
swarthy
cheek
and
brow
;
but
he
avert
his
gaze
,
and
continue
his
occupation
in
silence
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
do
you
shun
me
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Viviana
,
lay
her
hand
gently
upon
his
shoulder

<EOS>
and
,
as
he

not
answer
,
she
repeat
the
question
in
a
broken
voice

<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
then
look
up
,
and
perceive
that
her
eye
be
fill
with
tear
.
<EOS>
"i
<EOS>
shun
you
,
Viviana
,
for
two
reason
,
"
he
reply
gravely
,
but
kindly
;
"
first
,
because
I
would
have
no
tie
of
sympathy
to
make
me
cling
to
the
world
,
or
care
for
it
;
and
I
feel
that
if
I
suffer
myself
to
be
interested
about
you
,
this
will
not
long
be
the
case
:
secondly
,
and
chiefly
,
because
you
be
constantly
strive
to
turn
me
from
my
fix
purpose
;
and
,
though
your
effort
have
be
,
and
will
be
unavaile
,
yet
I
would
not
be
expose
to
them
further
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
fear
me
,
because
you
think
I
shall
shake
your
resolution

with
a
force
smile

I
will
trouble
you
no
more

,
if
you
wish
it
,
I
will
go

<EOS>
""It

well

in
accent
of
deep
emotion
,
and
take
her
hand
.

<EOS>
painful
as
will
be
the
parting
with
you
,
I
shall
feel
more
easy
when
it
be
over
.
<EOS>
It
grieve
me
to
the
soul
to
see
you

the
daughter
of
the
proud

the
wealthy
Sir
William
Radcliffe
—
an
inmate
of
this
wretched
abode
,
surround
by
desperate
man
,
whose
action
you
disapprove
,
and
whose
danger
you
be
compel
to
share
.
<EOS>
think
how
it
would
add
to
my
suffering
if
our
plot
—
which
Heaven
avert
—
should
be
discover
,
and
you
be
involve
in
it
.
<EOS>
""do
not
think
of
it
,
"

Viviana
.
<EOS>
"I
can
not
banish
it
from
my
thought

continue
fawke

"
I
can
not

it
to
my
feeling

young

on
this
idea

great

Viviana
;

me
as

aside,—as

bolt

from
the
cloud

all
in
its
course

which

not

something
terrible

me
as

whether
I

<EOS>
""no

<EOS>
no

unable

for
the
restoration

for
the
success

"At

such
be
the
effect

as
it

in
sullen
echo
along

Catesby

out

so
much
useless

as
many

narrow
space

him

<EOS>
but
they
find
that
their
task
be
much
more
arduous
than
they
have
anticipate
.
<EOS>
More
than
an
hour
elapse
before
they
could
loosen
another
stone
,
and
though
they
labour
with
the
utmost
perseverance
,
relieve
each
other
by
turn

they

make

a
small
breach

rest

<EOS>
still

they

it

not
until
the
third
day

a
hole
sufficiently
wide

admit
one
man

<EOS>
They

difficult

what

to
encounter
be
infinitely
more
so
.
<EOS>
Their

make
little

no

unyielding
substance

though
they

incessantly

His

uneasily

<EOS>
"I

<EOS>
It

the
young

whose
heart
beat
violently
at
the
sound
of
her
footstep

startle
by
the
alteration

Viviana

repelling
tone

I

Chetham

greatly
abash
;
"
but
,
have
learn
from
my

that
Doctor

the

<EOS>
Doctor

no
right

I

him

he
to

me

as
be
scarcely
probable

to
quit
my
companion

<EOS>
""I
know
not
what
connexion
there
may
be
between
you

justify
the
interposition
of
his
authority

reply
Chetham
;
"
neither
do
I
tarry
to
inquire
.
<EOS>
but
presume
from
what
I
hear
,
that
he
would
attempt
to
exercise
some
control
over
you

I
set
out
at
once

without

me
to
you

""I

the
chilling
answer

<EOS>
"I
will
not
avouch

pursue
Chetham

passionately

that
I
have
not
be
actuate
as
much
by
an
irrepressible
desire

see
you
again

as
by
anxiety
to
apprise
you
of
Doctor

coming

<EOS>
I
want
only
a
slight
excuse

myself
to
induce
me
to
yield
to
my
inclination

Your
departure
make
me
wretched

I
bitterly
reproach
myself

I
feel

it
be
not

It

It

with
admiration

purify
from
all

<EOS>
It

more

a

the

He
see
that

may
warn

those
around

his

he
take
several

Chetham
would
have
make
an

liberate
Viviana

his

down

it

through

They
both
then
fly
at

the
marshy
field

<EOS>
the
effect
become
speedily
manifest
in
the
alter

demeanour
of
the

,
and
it
be
evident
that
if
something
be
not
do
to
arouse
them
,
the
enterprise
would
be
abandon
.
<EOS>
Catesby

equally
superstitious
with
his
confederate

but
have
nerve
more
firmly
strung
,
be
the
first
to
conquer
his
terror
.
<EOS>
cross
himself

he

a
secret

and
,
snatch
up
a
pick

,
enter
the

resume
his

at
interval
during
the
whole
of
their
operation

it
offer
no
further
interruption
to
them

another

more
serious

,
arise

<EOS>
as
the
work
advance
,
without

aware
of

,
they
approach
the
bank
of
the
river
,
and
the
water
begin
to
ooze
through
the
side
of
the
excavation,—at
first
,
slightly
,
but
by
degree
to
such
an
extent
as
to
convince
them
that
their
labour
would
be
entirely
throw
away

<EOS>
large
portion
of
the
clay
,
loosen
by
the
damp
,
fall
in
upon
them
,
nearly
bury
those
near
the
tumble
mass
;
and
the
floor
be
now
in
some
place
more
than
a
foot
deep
in
water
,
clearly
prove
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
to
keep
the
powder
fit
for
use
in
such
a
spot
.
<EOS>
Catesby
bear
these
untoward
circumstance
with
ill
-
conceal
mortification
.
<EOS>
for
a
time
,
he
struggle
against
them
;
and
though
he
feel
that
it
be
hopeless
,
work
on
like
a
desperate
military
leader
conduct
a
forlorn
hope
to
certain
destruction
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
the
water
begin
to
make
such
incursion
that
he
could
no
longer
disguise
from
himself
or
his
companion
that
they
be
contend
against
insurmountable
difficulty
,
and
that
to
proceed
further
would
be
madness
.
<EOS>
He
,
therefore
,
with
a
heavy
heart
,
desist
,
and
throw
down
his
pick
-
axe
,
say
it
be
clear
that
Heaven
do
not
approve
their
design
,
and
that
it
must
be
relinquish

<EOS>
"we

to
have

he
observe
in
conclusion
.
<EOS>

I
now
perceive
its

as
I
be
the
first
to
act
in
direct
opposition
to
the
declared
will
of
the
Supreme
Being

so
now
I
be

my

reply
Garnet

can
only
attribute
it

<EOS>

whether
it

as
a
warning
or
a
guidance
,
I
confess
I
be
unable
to
say

<EOS>
""Can

Catesby

bitterly

when
you
look
at
yon
excavation

<EOS>
It
take
us
more
than

our

we

conceal

Lambeth

often

deem

as
she
think

before
mention
,
Viviana
scan
the
countenance
of
the
group
at
the
table
,
in
the
hope
of
discerning
in
them
some
glimpse
of
compassion
;
but
they
be
inscrutable
and
inexorable
,
and
scarcely
less
dreadful
to
look
upon
than
the
hideous
implement
on
the
wall
.
<EOS>
Viviana
wish
the
earth
would
open
and
swallow
her
,
that
she
may
escape
from
them
.
<EOS>
anything
be
well
than
to
be
leave
at
the
mercy
of
such
man
.
<EOS>
at
certain
time
,
and
not
unfrequently
at
the
most
awful
moment
,
a
double
current
of
thought
will
flow
through
the
brain
,
and
at
this
frightful
juncture
it
be
so
with
Viviana
.
<EOS>
while
shudder
at
all
she
see
around
her
,
nay
,
dwell
upon
it
,
another
and
distinct
train
of
thought
<EOS>
lead
her
back
to
former
scene
of
happiness
,
when
she
be
undisturbed
by
any
but
remote
apprehension
of
danger
.
<EOS>
She
think
of
her
tranquil
residence
at
Ordsall,—of
the
flower
she
have
tend
in
the
garden,—of
her
father
,
and
of
his
affection
for
her,—of
Humphrey
Chetham
,
and
of
her
early
and
scarce
-
acknowledge
attachment
to
him,—and
of
his
generosity
and
devotion
,
and
how
she
have
requite
it
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
like
a
sullen
cloud
darken
the
fair
prospect
,
arise
the
figure
of
Guy
Fawkes
—
the
sombre
enthusiast
—
who
have
unwittingly
exercise
such
a
baneful
influence
upon
her
fortune
.
<EOS>
"Had
<EOS>
he
not
cross
my
path
,
"
she
mentally
ejaculate
,
"
I
may
have
be
happy
—
may
have
love
Humphrey
Chetham
—
may
,
perhaps
,
have
wed
him!"these
<EOS>
reflection
be
suddenly
disperse
by
the
lieutenant
,
who
,
in
a
stern
tone
,
commence
his
interrogation
.
<EOS>
as
upon
her
previous
examination
,
Viviana
observe
the
utmost
caution
,
and
either
refuse
to
speak
,
or
answer
such
question
only
as
affect
herself
.
<EOS>
at
first
,
in
spite
of
all
her
effort
,
she
tremble
violently
,
and
her
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
.
<EOS>
but
after
a
while
,
she
recover
her
courage
,
and
regard
the
lieutenant
with
a
look
as
determined
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
"It
be
useless
to
urge
me
farther
,
"
she
conclude
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
say
all
I
will
say

<EOS>
""Is

companion

in
the
negative
,
and
the
one
near
him
remark
,
"

she
aware
what
will
follow?""i
am

"
reply
Viviana
,
resolutely
,
"
and
I
be
not
to
be
intimidate
.
<EOS>
"Sir
<EOS>
William
Waad
then
make
a
sign
to
Ipgreve
,
who
immediately
step
forward
and
seize
her
arm

<EOS>
"
You

recess

the
lieutenant

where
the
question
will
be

to
you

,
as
we
shall
remain
here

you
have
only
to
utter
a
cry

you
be
willing
to
avow
the
truth

the
torture

it

know
no

this
night

more
than

do
not

I

I
have
pass
three
day
within
the
Tower

and
only
ascertain
your
place
of
confinement
a
few
hour
ago

<EOS>
I
have
contrive
a
plan
for
your
escape
,
with
the
jailer

daughter
,
which
she
will
make
known
to
you
to

morrow

<EOS>
""I
can
not
thank
you
sufficiently
for
your
devotion
,
"
reply
Viviana
,
in
accent
of
the
deep
gratitude
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
implore
you
to
leave
me
to
my
fate
.
<EOS>
I
be
wretched
enough
now
,
Heaven
know
,
but
if
aught
should
happen
to
you
,
I
shall
be
infinitely
more
so
.
<EOS>
if
I
possess
any
power
over
you,—and
that
I
do
so
,
I
well
<EOS>
know,—I
entreat
,
nay
<EOS>
,
I
command
,
you
to
desist
from
this
attempt

<EOS>
""I
have
never
yet
disobey
you

Viviana

"
reply
the
young
merchant
,
passionately—"nor
<EOS>
will
I
do
so
now
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
bid
me
abandon
you
,
I
will
plunge
into
this
moat

never

rise
again

<EOS>
"His
<EOS>
manner
,
notwithstanding
the
low
tone
in
which
he
speak
,
be
so
determined
,
that
Viviana
feel
certain
he
would
carry
his
threat
into
execution
;
she
therefore
rejoin
in
a
mournful
tone,"Well
,
be
it
as
you
will

<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
to
resist
our

Chetham

"
if
I
can

I

<EOS>
the
jailer

explain
her
plan

you

morrow

<EOS>
promise
me
to
accede

it

<EOS>
"viviana
<EOS>
reluctantly
assented

<EOS>
"I
shall
quit
the
Tower
at
daybreak

pursue
Chetham
;

and
when
you
be
once
out
of
it
,
hasten
to
the
stair
beyond
the
wharf
at
Petty
Wales
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
there
with
a
boat
.
<EOS>
Farewell!"As
<EOS>
he
speak
,
he
let
himself
drop
into
the
water
,
but
his
foot
slip
,
the
plunge
be
loud
than
he
intend
,
and
attract
the
attention
of
a
sentinel
on
the
rampart
,
who
immediately
call
out
to
know
what
be
the
matter
,
and
not
receive
any
answer
,
discharge
his
caliver
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
.
<EOS>
Viviana
,
who
hear
the
challenge
and
the
shot
,
utter
a
loud
scream
,
and
the
next
moment
Ipgreve
and
his
wife
appear
.
<EOS>
the
jailer
glance
suspiciously
round
the
room
;
but
after
satisfy
himself
that
all
be
right
,
and
put
some
question
to
the
captive
,
which
she
refuse
to
answer
,
he
depart
with
his
wife
,
and
carefully
bar
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
imagine
great
misery
than
Viviana
endure
the
whole
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
the
uncertainty
in
which
she
be
keep
as
to
Chetham
's
fate
be
almost
insupportable
,
and
the
bodily
pain
she
have
recently
endure
appeared
light
when
compare
with
her
present
mental
torture
.
<EOS>
day
at
length
dawn
;

it
bring
with
it
no
Ruth

<EOS>
instead
of
this
faithful
friend
,
Dame
Ipgreve
enter
the
chamber
with
the
morning
meal
,
and
her
look
be
so
morose
and
distrustful
,
that
Viviana
fear
she
must
have
discover
her
daughter
's
design
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
,
however
,
venture
to
make
a
remark
,
but
suffer
the
old
woman
to
depart
in
silence
.
<EOS>
give
up
all
for
lost
,
and
conclude
that
Humphrey
Chetham
have
either
perish
,
or
be
,
like
herself
,
a
prisoner
,
Viviana
bitterly
bewail
his
fate
,
and
reproach
herself
with
be
unintentionally
the
cause
of
it

<EOS>
later
in
the
day

Ruth
enter
the

<EOS>
to
Viviana

eager
inquiry

reply

that

although

"Our

She

She

You

""And

<EOS>
ask

with
a
bewilder
look

<EOS>
"never

as
the
hour

Viviana
wish

farther
off

<EOS>
It
be
with
the
utmost
trepidation
that
she
hear
the
key
turn
in

and
behold
Ruth
enter
the
cell
with
the
evening
meal

<EOS>
close

and
set
down
the
provision
,
the

daughter
hastily
divest
herself
of
her
dress
,
which
be
of
brown
serge

as
well
as
of

imitate
her
example

<EOS>
without
pause
to

herself
in

Ruth

the

so
skilfully

hastily
whisper

press
her

Humphrey
Chetham
have
render
you
entitle
him
to
your
hand

<EOS>
It
be
seldom
—
whatever
poet
may
feign,—that
love
be
so
strongly
proved
as
his
have
be
;
and
it
ought
to
be
adequately
requite
.
<EOS>
""Say
<EOS>
no
more
about
it
<EOS>
,
I
entreat
,
"
interpose
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
I
will
deliver
my
opinion
,
"
rejoin
Guy
Fawkes
,
"
because
I
be
sure
what
I
advise
be
for
Viviana
's
happiness
.
<EOS>
no
one
can
love
her
better
than
you
.
<EOS>
no
one
be
more
worthy
of
her
.
<EOS>
nor
be
there
any
one
to
whom
I
so
much
desire
to
see
her
unite
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
Heaven
!
<EOS>
"
exclaim
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
bad
than
the
torture
.
<EOS>
""what
mean
you
?
<EOS>
"
exclaim
Fawkes
,
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"She
mean
,
"
interpose
Chetham
,
"
that
this
be
not
the
fitting
season
to
urge
the
subject
—
that
she
will
never
marry
.
<EOS>
""true
—
true
<EOS>
,
"
reply
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
ever
do
marry
—
I
ought
to
select
you
.
<EOS>
""You
ought
,
"
reply
fawke
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
know
nothing
of
the
female
heart
,
if
it
can
be
insensible
to
youth
,
devotion
,
and
manly
appearance
like
that
of
Humphrey
Chetham

<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
do
know
nothing
of
it

"
rejoin
Chetham
,
bitterly

<EOS>
"
woman
's
fancy
be
unaccountable
.
<EOS>
""such
be
the
received
opinion
,
"
reply
fawke
;
"
but
as
I
be
ignorant
of
the
sex
,
I
can
only
judge
from
report
.
<EOS>
You
be
the
person
I
should
imagine
she
would
love
—
<EOS>
nay

to
be
frank

I
think

<EOS>
""no

It
be
painful

to
Viviana

me

be
not

rejoin
Guy
Fawkes

Viviana
have
give
me
the
privilege
of
a
father

<EOS>
and
where
her
happiness
be
so
much
concerned
as
in
the
present
case
,
I
should
imperfectly
discharge
my
duty
if
I
do
not

out

<EOS>
It
would
sincerely
rejoice
me

and
I
be
sure
contribute
materially
to
her

let
us
change
the

<EOS>
a

<EOS>
"after
<EOS>
some
further

it

<EOS>

"It
be
about
a
mile

a
half
off

"
reply
the
man

<EOS>
"
if
you
pursue
that
lane
,
it
will
bring
you
to
a
small
village
about
half
a

at

slow
pace

they
arrive
in
about
half
an
hour
at
a
little
cluster
of
cottage

Guy

guess
to
be
the
village
allude
to
by
the
carrier

<EOS>
as
they
approach
it

a
rustic
leap
a
hedge

be
about
to
cross
to
another
field

Guy
Fawkes
call
to
him
,
inquire
the
way
to
White
Webbs

<EOS>
"I
be
go
in

direction

"
reply
the
man

<EOS>
"
if
you
desire
it

I
will

""I

forward

<EOS>
follow
their
guide
,
after
a
few
minute

brisk
walk
they
reach
the
border
of
the
forest

take
their
way
along
a
patch

afford
them
peep
into

heart
of
the
wood

<EOS>
It
be
a
beautiful
sylvan
scene

as
at
length
they
arrive

farther
end

I

one
of

You
will
see
it
at

next
turn

<EOS>
"As
the
countryman
have
intimate

they
speedily
perceive
the
roof

tall
chimney
of
an
ancient
house
above
the
tree

and
as
it
be
now
impossible
to
mistake
the

Guy
Fawkes
thank
their

for
his
trouble

they
shortly
afterwards

at
a
gate

to
the
house

a
large
building

erect
probably
at
the
beginning
of
Elizabeth

reign

and
enter
it

they
pass
under

<EOS>
on

observe
that
many
of

the
whole
appearance

melancholy
and
desert

in
his

would
be
present
with
the
King
,
his
father
,
in
the
Parliament
House
,
and
would
perish
with
him
;
and
in
this
case
,
as
Charles
,
Duke
of
York
,
(
afterwards
Charles
the
first

would
become

take
a
kindly
farewell

though
strongly

by
Guy

she
would
hold
out
no

of
a
change
in
her
sentiment
towards
the

<EOS>
meeting
be
occasionally

by
the

elsewhere
,
and
Catesby

more
than
one
interview
with
Tresham

(
and
perhaps
of

have
they

recover
his
equanimity
,

leave
alone
with

hold
long
and
frequent

<EOS>
He
spend
the

in
solitary

even
more
rigorously
than
he
be
enjoin
to
do
—
and
pray
with
such
fervour
and
frequency
,
that
,
fear
an
ill
effect
upon
his
health
,
and
almost
upon
his
mind
,
which
have
become
exalted
to
the
high
pitch
of
enthusiasm
,
Garnet
think
it
necessary
to
check
him
.
<EOS>
the
priest
do
not
fail
to
note
that
Viviana
's
name
never
pass
his
lip
,
and
that
in
all
their
walk
in
the
forest
he
carefully
shun
the
scene
of
his
espousal
.
<EOS>
and
thus

this

—
the
FIFTH
of
NOVEMBEROn
the
same
day
as
the
occurrence
last
relate
,
Lord
Mounteagle
,
who
be
then
stay
at
southwark
,
suddenly
intimate
his
intention
of
pass
the
night
at
his
country
mansion
at
Hoxton
;
a
change
of
place
which
,
trivial
as
it
seem
at
the
moment
,
afterwards
assume
an
importance
,
from
the
circumstance
that
arise
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
at
the
latter
part
of
the
day
,
he
accordingly
proceed
to
Hoxton
,
accompany
by
his
customary
attendant
,
and
all
appear
to
pass
on
as
usual
,
until
,
just
as
supper
be
over
,
one
of
his
page
arrive
from
town
,
and
desire
to
see
his
lordship
immediately
.
<EOS>
affect
to
treat
the
matter
with
indifference
,
Lord
Mounteagle
carelessly
order
the
youth
to
be
usher
into
his
presence
;
and
when
he
appear
,
he
demand
his
business
.
<EOS>
the
page
reply
,
that
he
bring
a
letter
for
his
lordship
,
which
have
be
deliver
under
circumstance
of
great
mystery
.
<EOS>
"I
have
leave
the
house
just
as
it
grow
dusk
,
"
he
say
,
"
on
an
errand
of
little
importance
,
when
a
man
,
muffle
in
a
cloak
,
suddenly
issue
from
behind
a
corner
,
and
demand
whether
I
be
one
of
your
lordship
's
servant
?
<EOS>
on
my
replying
in
the
affirmative
,
he
produce
this
letter
,
and
enjoin
me
,
as
I
value
my
life
and
your
lordship
's
safety
,
to
deliver
it
into
your
own
hand
without
delay
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
say
,
he
deliver
the
letter
to
his
lord
,
who
,
gaze
at
its
address
,
which
be
,
"
to
the
right
honourable
<EOS>
the
Lord
Mounteagle
,
"
observe
,
"
there
be
nothing
very
formidable
in
its
appearance
.
<EOS>
what
can
it
mean?"Without
even
break
the
seal
,
which
be
secure
with
a
silken
thread
,
he
give
it
to
one
of
his
gentleman
,
name
Ward
,
who
be
stand
near
him
.
<EOS>
"Read
it
<EOS>
aloud
,
sir
,
"
say
the
Earl
,
with
a
slight
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
it
be
some
vapoure
effusion
,
which
will
afford
us
occasion
for
laughter
.
<EOS>
before
I
hear
what
the
writer
have
to
say
,
I
can
promise
him
he
shall
not
intimidate
me
.
<EOS>
"Thus
exhort
,
Ward
break
open
the
letter
,
and
read
as
follows:—"My
lord
,
out
of
the
love
I
bear
to
some
of
your
friend
,
I
have
a
care
of
your
preservation
.
<EOS>
therefore
I
would
advise
you
,
as
you
tender
your
life
,
to
devise
some
excuse
to
shift
from
your
attendance
at
this
Parliament
,
for
God
and
man
have
concur
to
punish
the
wickedness
of
this
time
.
<EOS>
think
not
slightingly
of
this
advice
,
but
retire
into
the
country
,
where
you
may
expect
the
event
in
safety
;
for
,
though
there
be
no
appearance
of
any
stir
,
yet
I
say
they
shall
receive
a
terrible
blow
this
Parliament
,
and
yet
they
shall
not
know
who
hurt
them
.
<EOS>
this
counsel
be
not
to
be
contemn
.
<EOS>
It
may
do
you
good
,
and
can
do
you
no
harm
,
for
the
danger
be
pass
as
soon
as
you
have
burn
the
letter
.
<EOS>
God
,
I
hope
,
will
give
you
grace
to
make
good
use
of
it
,
to
whose
holy
protection
<EOS>
I
commend
you
.
<EOS>
""A
singular
letter
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Mounteagle
,
as
soon
as
Ward
have
finish
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
your
opinion
of
it?""I
think
it
hint
at
some
dangerous
plot
,
my
lord
,
"
reply
Ward
,
who
have
receive
his
instruction
,
"
some
treason
against
the
state
.
<EOS>
with
submission
,
I
would
advise
your
lordship
instantly
to
take
it
to
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
""i
see
nothing
in
it
,
"
reply
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
your
opinion
,
Mervyn
?
"
he
add
,
turn
to
another
of
his
gentleman
,
to
whom
he
have
likewise
give
his
lesson
.
<EOS>
"I
am
of
the
same
mind
as
Ward
,
"
reply
the
attendant
.
<EOS>
"your
lordship
will
hardly
hold
yourself
excuse
,
if
you
neglect
to
give
due
warning
,
should
aught
occur
hereafter
.
<EOS>
""Say
<EOS>
you
so
,
sir
?
"
cry
Lord
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"
let
me
hear
it
once
more
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
letter
be
accordingly
read
again
by
Ward
,
and
the
Earl
feign
to
weigh
over
each
passage
.
<EOS>
"I
be
advise
not
to
attend
the
Parliament
,
"
he
say
,
"
'
for
God
and
man
have
concur
to
punish
the
wickedness
of
this
time
.
'
<EOS>
that
be
too
vague
to
be
regard
.
<EOS>
then
I
be
urge
to
retire
into
the
country
.
<EOS>
the
recommendation
must
proceed
from
some
discontent
Catholic
,
who
do
not
wish
me
to
be
present
at
the
opening
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
the
first
time
I
have
be
so
adjure
.
'
<EOS>
They
shall
receive
a
terrible
blow
this
Parliament
,
and
yet
shall
not
know
who
hurt
them

'
<EOS>
that
be
mysterious
enough
,
but
it
may
mean
nothing,—any
more
than
what
follow
,
namely
,
'
the
danger
be
pass
as
soon
as
you
have
burn
the
letter
.
<EOS>
'""I
<EOS>
do
not
think
so
,
my
lord

"
reply
Ward
;
"
and
though
I
can
not
explain
the
riddle
,
I
be
sure
it
mean
mischief
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
"
say
Lord
Mounteagle
,
"
since
you
be
of
this
mind
,
I
must
lose
no
time
in
communicate
the
letter
to
the
Secretary
of
State
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
to
err
on
the
safe
side
.
<EOS>
"accordingly
<EOS>
,
after
some
further
consultation
,
he
set
out
at
that
late
hour
for
Whitehall
,
where
he
rouse
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
and
show
him
the
letter
.
<EOS>
It
be
almost
needless
to
state
that
the
whole
be
a
preconcerte
scheme
between
these
two
crafty
statesman
;
but
as
the
interview
take
place
in
the
presence
of
their
attendant

the
utmost
caution
be
observe

<EOS>
Salisbury
pretend
to
be
greatly
alarm
at
the
communication
,
and
couple
it
,
he
say
,
with
previous
intelligence
which
he
have
receive
,
he
could
not
help
fear
,
to
adopt
the
word
of
the
writer
of
the
mysterious
letter
,
that
the
Parliament
be
indeed
threaten
with
some
"
terrible
blow

<EOS>
"
acting
,
apparently
,
upon
this
supposition
,
he
cause
such
of
the
lord
of
the
Privy
Council
as
lodge
at
Whitehall
to
be
summon
,
and
submit
the
letter
to
them
,
they
all
concur
in
the
opinion
that
it
refer
to
some
dangerous
plot
,
though
none
could
give
a
guess
at
its
precise
nature

<EOS>
"It
be
clearly
some
popish
project
,
"
say
Salisbury
,
"
or
Lord
Mounteagle
would
not
have
be
the
party
warn

<EOS>
We
must
keep
a
look

out
upon
the
disaffect
of
his
faith

<EOS>
""as
<EOS>
I
have
be

in

an
impossibility

Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
beyond
what
can
be
gather
from
that
letter

<EOS>
but
I
pray
your
lordship
not
to
make
it
a

of
exercise
unnecessary
severity
towards

<EOS>
His
Majesty
will
not
return
from
the
hunt
expedition
on
which
he
be
engage
at
Royston
till
Thursday
next
,
the
30th
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
scarcely
worth
while
(
consider
his
naturally
timid
nature
,
with
which
your
lordship
be
well
acquaint
)
to
inform
him
of
the
threaten
danger
,
until
his
arrival
at
the
palace
.
<EOS>
It
will
then
be
time
enough
to
take
any
needful
step
,
as
Parliament
will
not
meet
for
four
or
five
day
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
the
policy
of
this
course
the
Privy
Councillors
agree
,

it
be
arrange
that
the
matter
should
be
keep
perfectly
secret
until
the
King
's
opinion
have
be
take
upon
the
letter

<EOS>
the
assemblage
then
break
up

it

previously
arrange
that
,
for
fear
of
some
attempt
upon
his
life

Lord
Mounteagle
should
remain
within
the
palace
till
full
inquiry
have
be
institute
into
the
affair

<EOS>
when
the
two
confederate
noble
be
leave
alone
,
Salisbury
observe
,
with
a
slight
laugh
,
to
his
companion,"Thus
far
we
have
proceed
well
,
and
without
suspicion

and
,
rely
upon
it
<EOS>

none

<EOS>
as
soon

the

yours

<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
what
of
Tresham
?
"
ask
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
the
deliverer
of
this
letter

I
have
little
faith
in
him
.
<EOS>
""Hum
!
"
say
Salisbury
,
after
a
moment
's
reflection
,
"
if
you
think
it
desirable
,
we
can
remove
him
to
the
Tower
,
where
he
can
be
easily
silence

<EOS>
""It
will
be
well
so

"
reply
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
may
else
babble
hereafter

<EOS>
I
give
him
a
thousand
pound
to
send
in
his

to
the
conspirator
the
other

lure
them
into

""It

salisbury

<EOS>
"
but
we
be
observe
,
and
must
therefore
separate

<EOS>
"So
<EOS>

,
he
withdraw

from
him
he
ascertain
all

fill
with
alarm

scarcely

he
cross
the
river

proceed
to
the
cellar

examine
the
mark
at

He
next
repair
to

he
possess
the

be
satisfied

out

no

come

anything

He
would
not

about
six
o'clock
on
the
follow
evening

who
strove

he
be
full

while

Tresham
unhesitatingly

with
apparent
frankness

<EOS>
"
I
be
fearful
you
would
make
a
further
tool
of
me

resolve
not
to
join
you
again
till
a
few
day
before
the
outbreak

<EOS>
to
this
determination
I

I

night

convey
to
the
Earl

<EOS>
It
may
not
convey
any
notion
of
the
plot

it
be
certain
to
occasion
alarm

I
think
it
my
duty

in
spite
of
every
personal
consideration

to
give
you
warn

if
you

there

Catesby

whisper

"if

continue
Tresham

I
should
not

come
hither

and
I
have
no
motive

such
baseness

I

though
the
alarm
have

I
do
not

They

evidently
on

""i

We
will
not

him

let
us
act
mercifully

"The
<EOS>
major

Garnet
avow
that
the
further
prosecution

so
hazardous

it

that

in
his
opinion

each
of

conspirator

well

that
at

the

treat
the
danger
so
slightingly

<EOS>
at
length

it

set
out

himself
under

"You

James

at

""Undoubtedly

undoubtedly

the
monarch

pleased
with
the
compliment
to
his
sagacity

alarm
by

that
must
evidently
be
the
meaning
of
the
passage

<EOS>
how
else
can
it
be
construe
,
except
by
reference
to
the
suddenness
of
the
act

may
be
as
quickly
perform
as
that

fire?""your

by
the
help
of
your
wisdom

I

not
a
corner
in

vault
shall
be
leave
unsearched

,
perhaps
you
will
think
with
me
,
that
,
in
order
to
catch
these
traitor

it
will
be
well

now
I
must
entreat
you
to
dismiss
the

securely

for
you
may
rely
upon
it

fully
unravelled

"The
significant
tone
in
which
the
Earl
utter
the
latter
part

this
speech

convince
the
King
that
he
know
more
of
the
matter

content
himself
with

regard
him

receive

fancy
it
would

remove
him

will

"Catesby
<EOS>
need
no

,
spring
into
the

hastily
murmur
his

strike
into
a
lane
on
the
right
,
ride
off
at

pace
towards
Highgate

<EOS>
on
reach
the
brow
of

beautiful
hill

he
draw
in
the

for
a
moment
,

gaze
towards
the
city
he
have
just
quit

<EOS>
dark
and
bitter
be
his
thought
as
he
fix
his
eye
upon
Westminster
Abbey
,
and
fancy
he
could
discern
the
neighbouring
pile
,
whose
destruction
he
have
meditate
.
<EOS>
remember
that
from
this
very
spot
,
when
he
have
last
approach
the
capital
,
in
company
with
Guy
Fawkes
and
Viviana
Radcliffe
,
he
have
look
in
the

direction
,
he
could
not
help
contrast
his
present
sensation
with
those
he

then
experience

<EOS>
at
that
time
he
be
full
of
ardour

and
confident
of
success

<EOS>
now
,
all
be
lose
to
him
,
and
he
be
anxious
for
little
more
than
self

preservation

<EOS>
involuntarily
,
his
eye
wander
along
the
great
city
,
until
pass
over
the
mighty
fabric
of
Saint

upon
the
tower,—upon
the
place
of
Guy

's
captivity

"And
<EOS>
can
nothing
be
do
for
his
deliverance

<EOS>
sigh
Catesby
,
as
he
turn
away
,
his
eye
fill
with
moisture
"
must
that
brave
soldier
die
the
death
of
a

horror

<EOS>
if
he

I

if
he
have
destroy
himself

together
with
his
foe

as
he
resolve
to
do
,
I
should
have
envy
him

the
idea
of
what
he
will
have
to
suffer
in
that
dreadful
place
—
nay
,
what
he
be
now
,
perhaps
,
suffering
—
make
the
life

blood
curdle
in
my
vein

I

"with
<EOS>
this
resolve

strike
spur
into

rapidly
forward

They
shout
to
him
to

and
as
they
be
better
mount

he

it
be
evident
they
would
soon
come
up
with
him

<EOS>
determined
,
however
,
to
adhere
to
the
resolution
he
have
just
form
,
and
not
to
yield
himself
with
life

he
prepare
for
a
conflict

suddenly
halt

he
conceal
a
petronel
beneath
his
cloak

"I

well
than
his

into
the
cellar
by
his

who
instantly
commence
their
search

<EOS>
in
a
corner
behind
the
door
they
discover
a
dark
lantern
,
with
a
light
burn
within
it
;
and
move
with
the
utmost
caution
—
for
they
be
afraid
of
bring
sudden
destruction
upon
themselves
—
they
soon
perceive
the
barrel
of
gunpowder
range
against
the
wall
.
<EOS>
carefully
remove
the
plank
,
billet
,
and
iron
bar
with
which
they
be
cover
,
they
remark
that
two
of
the
cask
be
stave
in
,
while
the
hoop
from
a
third
be
take
off
,
and
the
powder
scatter
around
it

<EOS>
They
also
notice
that
several
train
be
lay
along
the
floor,—everything
,
in
short
,
betoken
that
the
preparation
for
the
desperate
deed
be
fully
complete
.
<EOS>
while
they
be
make
this
investigation
,
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
,
see
that
further
resistance
be
useless
,
have
remain
perfectly
motionless
up
to
this
moment
,
suddenly
make
a
struggle
to
free
himself
;
and
so
desperate
be
the
effort
,
that
he
burst
the
leathern
thong
that
bind
his
hand
,
and
seize
the
soldier
near
to
him
,
bore
him
to
the
ground

He
then
grasp
the
low
limb
of
another

who
hold
a
lantern

strove
to
overthrow
him
,

wrest
the
lantern
from
his
grasp
,
evidently
intend
to
apply
the
light
to
the
powder

<EOS>
and
he
would
unquestionably
have
execute
his
terrible
design
,
if
three
of
the
most
powerful
of
the
soldier
have
not
throw
themselves
upon
him
,
and
overpower
him
.
<EOS>
all
this
be
the
work
of
a
moment

but
it
be
so
startling

that
Sir

both
courageous
man

use

scene

you
will

pursue

give
vent
to
execration
against
the
prisoner
,
to
which
the
other
reply
by
a
disdainful
laugh

They
then
look
about
,
in
the
hope
of
find
some
document
or
fragment
of
a
letter
,
which
may
serve
as
a
clue
to
the
other
party
connect
with
the
fell
design

without
success

<EOS>
nothing
be
find
except
a
pile
of
arm

though
they
examine
them
,
no
name
or
cipher
could
be
trace
on
any
of
the
weapon

"We

when

<EOS>
Sir

there
when

stern
tone
whether

obstinate
,
and
receive
no

him
to
be

in
the
gauntlet

<EOS>
upon
this
,
he

suspend
from
a
beam
by
his
hand
,
and
endure
five
hour
of
the
most
excruciating
agony
—
his
finger

so
crushed
and
lacerate
that

He

It

about
twenty
foot
wide
and
twelve
deep
,
and
at
high
tide
be
generally
more
than
two
foot
deep
in
water

<EOS>
into
this
dreadful
chasm
be
Guy
Fawkes
lower
by
his
attendant
,
who
,
warn
him
of
the
probable
fate
that
await
him
,
leave
him
in
total
darkness

<EOS>
at
this
time
the
pit
be
free
from
water
;
but
he
have
not
be
there
more
than
an
hour
,
when
a
bubble
and
hiss
sound
proclaim
that
the
tide
be
rise
,
while
frequent
plash
convince
him
that
the
rat
be
at
hand

<EOS>
stoop
down
,
he
feel
that
the
water
be
alive
with
them

that
they
be
all
around
him
—
and
would
not

probably
,
delay
their
attack

<EOS>
prepare
as
he
be
for
the
bad
,
he
could
not
repress
a
shudder
at
the
prospect
of
the
horrible
death
with
which
he
be
menace
.
<EOS>
at
this
juncture
,
he
be
surprised
by
the
appearance
of
a
light
,
and
perceive
at
the
edge
of
the
pit
a
female
figure
bear
a
lantern
.
<EOS>
not
doubt
it
be
his
visitant
of
the
former
night
,
he
call
out
to
her
,
and
be
answer
in
the
voice
of
Ruth
Ipgreve

<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
dare
not

here
many
minute
,

she

,
"
because
my

suspect
me
.

I
could
not
let
you
perish
thus
.
<EOS>
I
will
let
down
this
lantern
to
you
,
and
the
light
will
keep
away
the
rat
.
<EOS>
when
the
tide
retire
you
can
extinguish
it

<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
say
,
she
tear
her
kerchief
into
shred
,
and
tie
the
slip
together
,
lower
the
lantern
to
the
prisoner
,
and
without
wait
to
receive
his
thank
,
hurry
away
.
<EOS>
thus
aid
,
Guy
Fawkes
defend
himself
as
well
as
he
could
against
his
loathsome
assailant

<EOS>
the
light
show
that
the
water
be
swarm
with
them
—
that
they
be
creep
by
hundred
up
the
side
of
the
pit
,
and
prepare
to
make
a
general
attack
upon
him
.
<EOS>
at
one
time
,
Fawkes
determine
not
to
oppose
them
,
but
to
let
them
work
their
will
upon
him
;
but
the
contact
of
the
noxious
animal
make
him
change
his
resolution
,
and
he
instinctively
drive
them
off
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
,
however
,
to
be
easily
repulse
,
and
return
to
the
charge
with
great
fury
than
before
.
<EOS>
the
desire
of
self
preservation
now
get
the
well
of
every
other
feeling
,
and
the
dread
of
be
devour
alive
give
new
vigour
to
his
crippled
limb
,
he
rush
to
the
other
side
of
the
pit
.
<EOS>
His
persecutor
,
however
,
follow
him
in
myriad
,
spring
upon
him
,
and
make
their
sharp
tooth
meet
in
his
flesh
in
a
thousand
place
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
the
contest
continue
for
some
time
,
Guy
Fawkes
speed
round
the
pit
,
and
his
assailant
never
for
one
moment

in
the
pursuit
,
until
he
fall
from
exhaustion
,
and
his
lantern
be
extinguish

the
whole
host
dart
upon
him
.
<EOS>
think
all
over
,
he
could
not
repress
a
loud
cry
,
and
it
be
scarcely
utter
,
when
light
appear
,

several
gloomy
figure

among

gloomy

cheer
on

soon
cut

call
upon

hold
out
promise

only
excite
the
derision

indeed
,
the
deject
look
of
most
of
the
band

the
drenched

muddy
state
of
their

make
them

contempt

apprehension

their
number
prevent
an

Catesby
's
address
conclude
amid
groan
of
dissatisfaction

find
he
be
waste
time

injure
his
own
cause

he
give
the
word
to
march

move
slowly
through

another
unpropitious

no
attention

pay
to
his

he
shoot
the
man
near
him
,
and
compel
the
other
,
by
threat
of
the
same
punishment
,
to
return
to
their
rank
.
<EOS>
this
occurrence
,
while
it
occasion
much
discontent
and
ill

will
among
the
band
,
give
great
uneasiness
to
their
leader

<EOS>
Catesby
and
Percy
now
bring
up
the
rear

keep
a
sharp
look

out
to
check
any

Catesby
would
have
challenge
it

but
an
undefinable
terror
seize
him
,
and
his
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
an
idea
rise
to
his
mind
that
it
be
the
spirit
of
Guy
Fawkes
,
and
,
by
a
powerful
effort
,
he
compel
himself
to
address
it
.
<EOS>
"Are
<EOS>
you
come
to
warn
me
?

"
he
demand

<EOS>
the
figure
move
in
acquiescence
,
and
withdraw
the
cloak

reveal
feature
of
ghastly
paleness

resemble
those
of
Fawkes

"Have
I

shake
its

the

again
make
a
gesture
in
the
negative

<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
next

incline
its
head
,
the
figure
once
more
muffle
its
ghastly
visage
in
its
cloak
,
and
melt
from
his
view
.
<EOS>
for
some
time
Catesby
remain
in
a
state
almost
of
stupefaction
.
<EOS>
He
then
summon
up
all
the
resolution
of
his
nature
,
and
instead
of
return
to
the
house
,
continue
to
pace
to
and
fro
in
the
court
,
and
at
last
walk
forth
into
the
garden
.
<EOS>
It
be
profoundly
dark
;
and
he
have
not
advance
many
step
when
he
suddenly
encounter
a
man
.
<EOS>
repress
the
exclamation
that
rise
to
his
lip
,
he
draw
a
petronel
from
his
belt
,
and
wait
till
the
person
address
him

<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
you

Sir
John
Foliot

ask
a
voice
,

he
instantly
recognise
as
that
of
Topcliffe

"Ay

Catesby

in
a
low
tone

<EOS>
"Did
<EOS>
you

get
into

Topcliffe

<EOS>
"I

Topcliffe

"Hum

Catesby

hesitating
,
in
the
hope
of
induce
the
other
to
betray
his
design

<EOS>
"Or

"he

so
soon

Topcliffe

then
we
shall
have
to
besiege

I
have
no

I
will
return

the
report

at

Catesby
pace
backwards

forwards
within
a
passage

from
the
hall
to
the
dining

chamber
.
<EOS>
His
thought
be
gloomy
enough
,
and
he
retrace
the
whole
of
his
wild
and
turbulent
career
,
ponder
upon
its
close
,
which
he
could
not

from
himself

at

<EOS>
"It

matter
not

"
I
shall
not
die
ignominiously

I
would
rather
perish
in
the
vigour

linger
out
a
miserable
old
age

<EOS>
I
have
strive
hard

achieve
a

have
fail

<EOS>
this

Our

,
be
they
true

I

little
reliance

<EOS>
They
have
no

the
confidence

can
alone
insure
success

I

will
propose
a
surrender

<EOS>
surrender
!

I
will
never

so
with

<EOS>
something
must

do

something
worthy

aloud

I
tell
you
I
have
a
strange
and
appalling
dream
to

night
,
and
I
will
now
relate
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
be
in
a
boat
upon
the
river
Thames
,
when
all
at
once
the
day
,
which
have
be
bright
and
smile
,
become
dark
and
overcast,—not
dark
like
the
shade
of
night
,
but
gloomy
and
ominous
,
as
when
the
sun
be
shroud
by
an
eclipse
.
<EOS>
I
look
around
,
and
every
object
be
alter
.
<EOS>
the
tower
of
Saint
Paul
's
stand
awry
,
and
seem
ready
to
topple
down,—so
do
the
spire
and
tower
of
all
the
surround
fane
.
<EOS>
the
house
on
London
Bridge
lean
frightfully
over
the
river
,
and
the
habitation
line
its
bank
on
either
side
,
seem
shaken
to
their
foundation
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
some
terrible
earthquake
must
have
occur
,
or
that
the
end
of
the
world
be
at
hand
.
<EOS>
""go
on
,
"
say
Catesby
,
who
have
listen
with
profound
attention
to
the
relation
.
<EOS>
"The
stream
,
too
,
change
its
colour
,
"
continue
Robert
Winter
,
"
and
become
red
as
blood
,
and
the
man
who
row
my
boat
be
go
,
and
his
place
occupy
by
a
figure
mask
and
habit
like
an
executioner
.
<EOS>
I
command
him
to
row
me
ashore
,
and
in
an
instant
the
bark
shot
to
land
,
and
I
spring
out
,
glad
to
be
liberate
from
my
mysterious
conductor
.
<EOS>
My
step
involuntarily
lead
me
toward
the
cathedral
,
and
on
enter
it
,
I
find
its
pillar
,
shrine
,
monument
,
and
roof
hang
with
black
.
<EOS>
the
throng
that
ever
haunt
Paul
's
Walk
have
disappear
,
and
a
few
dismal
figure
alone
traverse
the
aisle
.
<EOS>
on
approach
them
,
I
recognise
in
their
swollen
,
death
-
like
,
and
blacken
lineament
,
some
resemblance
to
you
and
our
friend

I
be
about
to
interrogate
them

I
be
awaken
by
yourself

strange

musingly

couple
with

bode
evil

describe
the
supernatural

Catesby

"
We
must
not
disgrace
ourselves
and
our
cause

<EOS>
""You
be
right
,
"
rejoin
Robert
Winter
;
"
but
these
vision
be
more
terrible
than
the
contemplation
of

itself

""if

it

enough

Robert

I
dare
not

Catesby

I
would

melancholy

upon
me

leave
him

he
withdraw
into
a
closet

there
be
an
image

<EOS>
but
at
this
season
,
and
at
this
hour
,
both
park
and
mansion
have
a
forlorn
look
.
<EOS>
the
weather
still
continue
foggy
,
with
drizzling
shower
,
and
though
the
tree
be
not
yet
entirely
strip
of
their
foliage
,
their
glory
have
altogether
depart
.
<EOS>
the
turf
be
damp
and
plashy
,
and
in
some
place
partook
so
much
of
the
character
of
a
swamp
,
that
the
horseman
be
oblige
to
alter
their
course
.
<EOS>
but
all
obstacle
be
eventually
overcome
,
and
in
ten
minute
after
their
entrance
into
the
park
,
they
be
within
gunshot
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
symptom
of
defence
apparent
,
but
the
drawbridge
be
raise
,
it
be
Catesby
's
opinion
,
notwithstanding
appearance
,
that
their
arrival
be
expect
.
<EOS>
He
be
further
confirm
in
this
idea
when
,
sound
a
trumpet
,
and
call
to
the
porter
to
let
down
the
drawbridge
,
no
answer
be
return
.
<EOS>
the
entrance
to
the
mansion
be
through
a
lofty
and
machiolated
gateway
,
strengthen
at
each
side
by
an
embattle
turret
.
<EOS>
perceive
a
man
at
one
of
the
loophole
,
Catesby
discharge
his
petronel
at
him
,
and
it
be
evident
from
the
cry
that
follow
that
the
person
be
wound
.
<EOS>
an
instant
afterwards
caliver
be
thrust
through
the
other
loophole
,
and
several
shot
fire
upon
the
rebel
,
while
some
dozen
armed
man
appear
upon
the
summit
of
the
tower
,
and
likewise
commence
firing
.
<EOS>
perceive
Topcliffe
among
the
latter
,
and
enrage
at
the
sight
<EOS>
,
Catesby
discharge
another
petronel
at
him
,
but
without
effect
.
<EOS>
He
then
call
to
some
of
his
man
to
break
down
the
door
of
an
adjoining
barn
,
and
to
place
it
in
the
moat
.
<EOS>
the
order
be
instantly
obey
,
and
the
door
afloat
in
the
fosse
,
and
spring
upon
it
,
he
impel
himself
with
a
pike
towards
the
opposite
bank
.
<EOS>
several
shot
be
fire
at
him
,
and
though
more
than
one
strike
the
door
,
he
cross
the
moat
uninjured
.
<EOS>
so
suddenly
be
this
dare
passage
effect
,
that
before
any
of
the
defender
of
the
mansion
could
prevent
him
,
Catesby
have
sever
the
link
of
the
chain
fasten
the
drawbridge
,
and
it
fall
clatter
down
.
<EOS>
with
a
loud
shout
,
his
companion
then
cross
it
.
<EOS>
but
they
have
still
a
difficulty
to
encounter
.
<EOS>
the
gate
,
which
be
of
great
strength
,
and
cover
with
plate
of

but
a

and

<EOS>
He

and
several

they
make
their
way
down
a
flight
of
stone
step
,
and
proceed
to
the
gateway
,
throw
it
open
,
and
admit
the
other
.
<EOS>
all
this
be
the
work
of
a
few
minute
.
<EOS>
commit
the
ransacking
of
the
mansion
to
Digby
and
Percy
,
and
command
a
dozen
man
to
follow
him
,
Catesby
enter
a
small
arched
doorway
,
and
ascend
a
wind

in
search
of

<EOS>
His

partly
by
threat
,
partly
by
persuasion

<EOS>
this
unlooke
-
for
success
so
encourage

<EOS>
Catesby
appear
as
much
elate
as
the
other

but
at
heart
he
be
full
of
misgive

<EOS>
soon
afterwards

<EOS>
as
they

they
perceive
a
large
party

near
Bromsgrove

and
evidently
in

of
them
.
<EOS>
an
immediate

,
and
take
possession
of
a
farm

<EOS>

these

Sir

by
a
large
posse
of

,
all
tolerably
well
armed
,
draw
up
at
some
distance
from
the
farm
,
and
appear
to
be
consult
as
to
the
prudence
of
make
an
attack
.
<EOS>
Topcliffe
be
with
them
;
and
Catesby
,
who
reconnoiter
their
proceeding
from
a
window
of
the
dwelling
,
infer
from
his
gesture
that
he
be
against
the
assault
.
<EOS>
and
so
it
prove
.
<EOS>
the
royalist
party
remain
where
they
be
,
and
as
one
or
two
of
their
number
occasionally
disappear
,
Catesby
judge
,
and
correctly
,
that
they
be
despatch
for
a
reinforcement
.
<EOS>
not
willing
to
wait
for
this
,
he
determine
to
continue
his
march
,
and
,
accordingly
,
form
his
man
into
a
close
line
,
and
bring
up
the
rear
himself
,
they
again
set
forward
.
<EOS>
Sir
Richard
Walsh
and
his
party
follow
them
,
and
whenever
they
be
in
a
difficult
part
of
the
road
,
harass
them
with
a
sudden
attack
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
,
several
straggler
be
cut
off
,
and
a
few
prisoner
make
.
<EOS>
so
exasperate
do
Catesby
become
by
these
annoyance
,
<EOS>
that
,
though
desirous
to
push
forward
as
fast
as
possible
,
he
halt
at
the
entrance
of
a
common
,
and
prepare
for
an
engagement
.
<EOS>
but
his
purpose
be
defeat
,
for
the
royalist
party
take
another
course
,
nor
do
he
see
anything
more
of
them
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
in
about
an
hour
the
rebel
arrive
at
the
bank
of
the
river
Stour
,
not
far
from
the
little
village
of
Churchill
,
and
here
,
just
as
they
be
prepare
to
ford
the
stream
,
the
sheriff
and
his
follower
again
make
their
appearance
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
also
,
the
force
of
their
opponent
be
considerably

and
as
more
than
a
third
of
their
own
party
be
engage
in
cross
the
stream
,
which
be
greatly
swell
by
the
recent
rain
,
and
extremely
dangerous
,
their
position
be
one
of
no
slight
peril
.
<EOS>
nothing
daunt
,
Catesby
instantly
draw
up
his
man
on
the
bank
,
and
,
after
a
short
skirmish
,
drive
away
the
enemy
,
and
afterwards
contrive
to
cross
the
river
without
much
loss
.
<EOS>
He
find
,
however
,
that
the
baggage
-
cart
have
get
immerse
in
the
stream
,
and
it
be
fear
that
the
powder
would
be
damage
.
<EOS>
They
remain
on
the
opposite
bank
for
some
time
;
but
as
their
enemy
do
not
attempt
to
follow
them
,
they
take
the
way
to
Holbeach
,
a
large
and
strongly
build
mansion
belong
,
as
have
be
already
state
,
to
Stephen

<EOS>
here
they
arrive
without
further
molestation
,
and
their
first
business
be
to
put
it
into
a
complete
state
of
defence
.
<EOS>
IllustrationAfter
a
long
and
anxious
consultation
,
Sir
Everard
Digby
quit
them
,
undertake
to
return
on
the
follow
day
with
succour
.
<EOS>
Stephen
Littleton
also
disappear
on
the
same
evening
.
<EOS>
His
flight
produce
a
strong
impression
on
Catesby
,
and
he
beseech
the
other
not
to
abandon
the
good
cause
,
but
to
stand
by
it
,
as
he
himself
mean
to
do
,
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
They
all
earnestly
assure
him
that
they
would
do
so
,
except
Robert
Winter
,
who
sit
apart
,
and
take
no

Catesby
then

be
plunge
in
the
water
in
cross
the
Stour
,
and
find
it
so
much
wet
as
to
be
nearly
useless
.
<EOS>
a
sufficient
stock
of
powder
be
of
the
utmost
consequence
to
them
,
he
cause
all
the
content
of
the
barrel
,
not
dissolve
by
the
immersion
,
to
be

<EOS>
"Heaven

<EOS>

Catesby

recollect

Catesby
's
untire
energy

His

their

what

heavy
of

he
detect
a

tread
on

presently

could
discern
no
object

he
distinctly
hear
a
plank
push
across
the
moat

could
distinguish
in
the
whisper
accent
of
one
of
the
party
the
voice
of
Topcliffe

a
thrill
of
savage
joy

his

into

a

throw
its
light
upon

man
near
him
,
who
prove
,
as
he
suspect

to

Topcliffe

<EOS>
aware
of
the
advantage
of
make
a
prisoner
of
importance

Catesby
control
the
impulse
that
prompt
him
to
sacrifice
Topcliffe
to
his
vengeance
,
and
fire
his
petronel
in
the
air
as
a
signal
,

draw
his
sword

spring
upon
him

<EOS>
Topcliffe

but
he
be
no
match
for
the
skill
and
impetuosity
of
Catesby

and
be
instantly
overpower
and
throw
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
Percy
and
several
of
the
band
have
come
up
,
and
deliver
Topcliffe
to
the
charge
of
two
of

stout
of

his
attention
to
the

of
them
get
across
the
moat

but
the
other
,
encumber
by
his
arm

be
flounder
about

when
Catesby
point
a
petronel
at
his
head

he
be
fain
to

be
drag
out

a
volley
of

by

for
some
time

a
guard
upon

spot

to
examine
Topcliffe

He
have
be
throw
into
a
cellar

kitchen

He

any

into

leave
him
,
with
the
strict
injunction
to
the
man
as

his
safe
custody

He
then
proceed
to
examine
the

more
tractable

also
ascertain
that

he
read
this
,
but
his
brow
darken
as
he
proceed
,
and
find
that
a
magnificent
reward
be

for
his
own
arrest

"I

run
the
missive,—"so

"The

everything
look
gloomy

depressing

the
conspirator
be
so
disheartened

that
they
avoid
each

<EOS>
Catesby
mount
the
wall
of
the
mansion
to
reconnoitre
.
<EOS>
the
prospect
be
forlorn
and
melancholy
to
the
last
degree
.
<EOS>
the
neighbouring
wood
be
obscure
by
mist
;
the
court
-
yard
and
garden
flood
with
rain
;
and
the
water
of

spot
by
the
heavy
shower

<EOS>
not
an
object
be
in

,
except
a

<EOS>
Catesby
shout
to
him
,
and
the
fellow
with
evident
reluctance
approach
the
brink
of
the
moat
,
be
ask
whether
he
have
see
any
troop
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
the
man
answer
in

negative

say
he
have
hear
that
an
engagement
have
take
place
in

night
,
about
five
mile

near

and
that
Sir
Everard

party
have
be
utterly
route
,
and
himself
take
prisoner

<EOS>
this
intelligence
be
a
severe
blow
to
Catesby
,
as
it
destroy
the
last
faint
hope
he
have
cling
to
.
<EOS>
for
some
time
he
continue
wrapt
in
thought
,
and
then
descend
to
the
low
part
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
a
large
fire
have
be
keep
up
during
the
night
in
the
hall

the
great
part
of
the

round
it
,
dry
their
wet

converse
together
.
<EOS>
a
plentiful
breakfast
have
be
serve
out
to
them
,
so
that
they
be
in
tolerably
good
spirit
,
and
many
of
them
talk
loudly
of
the
feat
they
mean
to
perform
in
case
of
an
attack
.
<EOS>
Catesby
hear
these
boast
,
but
they
fall
upon
an
idle
ear
.
<EOS>
He
feel
that
all
be
over
;
that
his
last
chance
be
go
;
and
that
the
struggle
could
not
be
much
longer
protract
.
<EOS>
enter
the
inner
room
,
he
sit
down
at

he
eat

You

HAGLEYRobert
Winter
,
it
may
be
remember
,
immediately
after
the
explosion
,
quit
Holbeach
,
and
do
not
return
to
it
.
<EOS>
He
proceed
to
the
neighbour
thicket
,
and
while
wander
about
in
a
state
border
on
distraction
encounter
Stephen
Littleton
,
who
have
likewise
desert
his
companion
on
the
same
day
.
<EOS>
acquaint
him
with
the
disastrous
occurrence
that
have
take
place
,
and
state
his
impression
that
both
God
and
man
be
against
them
,
and
that
it
would
be
vain
as
well
as
impious
to
struggle
longer
,
he
propose
to
him
to
surrender
.
<EOS>
but
Stephen
Littleton
so
strongly
combat
this
opinion
,
that
he
at
last
consent
to
make
an
effort
to
escape
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
no
easy
matter
,
nor
could
they
devise
a
plan
that
appear
feasible
.
<EOS>
both
be
well
provide
with
money
;
but
under
present
circumstance
it
would
be
of
little
use
to
them
.
<EOS>
a
large
price
be
set
on
their
head
,
and
the
whole
country
alarm
,
they
scarcely
know
where
to
seek
shelter
.
<EOS>
after
a
long
debate
,
they
quit
the
covert
,
and
keep
clear
of
all
habitation
,
take
the
direction
of
Stourbridge
.
<EOS>
on
approach
the
Stour
,
at
a
point
opposite
Churchill
,
where
they
know
the
river
be
fordable
,
they
perceive
Sir
Richard
Walsh
's
force
approach
,
and
throw
themselves
into
a
ditch
to
avoid
observation
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
dark
when
they
again
venture
forth
,
and
at
the
peril
of
their
life
they
ford
the
Stour
,
which
be
swell
more
than
it
have
be
in
the
morning
by
the
long
-
continue
rain
.
<EOS>
Their
design
be
to
proceed
to
Hagley
,
the
residence
of
Stephen
Littleton
's
sister
,
Mrs.
Littleton
,
and
to
claim
her
protection
.
<EOS>
this
magnificent
mansion
lie
about
two
mile
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
,
in
the
heart
of
an
extensive
park
,
but
they
be
oblige
to
take
a
circuitous
route
of
nearly
double
the
distance
to
reach
it
,
and
when
at
length
they
arrive
there
,
and
be
about
to
steal
into
the
court
-
yard
;
they
find
it
occupy
by
a
portion
of
Sir
Richard
Walsh
's
troop
.
<EOS>
Overcome
by
anxiety
and
fatigue
,
and
scarcely
know
whither
to
proceed
,
they
recrosse
the
park
,
and
seek
out
the
cottage
of
a
poor
woman
,
whose
two
son
have
join
their
ill
-
fate
expedition
,
and
be
at
that
moment
under
arm
at
Holbeach
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
good
Catholic
,
and
they
think
they
may
confide
in
her
.
<EOS>
arrive
at
her
cottage
,
they
glance
in
at
the
window
,
and
perceive
her
,
as
they
conclude
,
alone
,
and
cook
a
small
piece
of
meat
at
the
fire
,
they
raise
the
latch
,
and
enter
the
house
.
<EOS>
the
woman
turn
at
their
approach
,
and
utter
a
cry
of
surprise
and
alarm
,
point
towards
a
back
room
.
<EOS>
They
then
see
that
they
have
betray
themselves
;
but
the
caution
come
too
late
,
and
a
stalwart
trooper
,
alarm
by
the
cry
,
issue
from
the
back
room
.
<EOS>
from
the
wretched
appearance
of
the
new
-
comer
,
he
at
once
guess
that
they
be
rebel
,
and
feel
satisfied
,
from
the
richness
of
their
apparel
,
dirty
and
stain
as
it
be
,
that
they
be
person
of
consequence
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
he
draw
a
brace
of
petronel
,
and
hold
them
at
their
head
,
command
them
to
surrender
.
<EOS>
They
be
too
much
take
by
surprise
,
and
too
enfeeble
to
offer
resistance
,
and
the
trooper
call
to
the
old
woman
to
bring
a
cord
to
bind
them
,
at
the
same
time
unloose
his
own
girdle
,
with
which
he
fasten
Robert
Winter
's
arm
behind
his
back
.
<EOS>
in
do
this
,
he
be
compel
to
lay
down
his
petronel
,
and
he
have
scarcely
do
so
,
when
the
woman
snatch
them
up
,
and
give
them
to
Stephen
Littleton
,
who
present
them
at
his
head
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
the
turn
of
the
conspirator
to
triumph
.
<EOS>
in
another
instant
,
Robert
Winter
be
release
by
the
old
woman
,
and
the
pair
throw
themselves
upon
the
trooper
,
force
him
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
They
then
drag
him
to
the
back
room
,
and
strip
him
of
his
habiliment
,
which
Stephen
Littleton
put
on
instead
of
his
own
attire
,
and
bind
him
hand
and
foot
,
return
to
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
at
the
request
of
Robert
Winter
,
she
furnish
him
with
a
suit
of
clothe
belong
to
one
of
her
son
,
and
then
set
before
them
the
good
eatable
she
possess
.
<EOS>
They
be
ravenously
hungry
,
and
soon
dispose
of
the
viand
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
their
hostess
tell
them
that
the
whole
country
be
in
arm
against
them
;
that
Mrs.
Littleton
be
suspect
,
though
she
have
always
be
adverse
to
the
design
,
her
house
have
undergo
a
rigorous
search
;
but
that
Mr.
Humphrey
Littleton
,
not
have
take
any
part
in
the
insurrection
,
have
not
as
yet
be
arrest
,
though
it
be
fear
he
would
be
prove
to
be
connect
with
the
plot
.
<EOS>
She
conclude
by
strongly
counsel
them
to
use
the
utmost
caution
,
and
to
expose
themselves
as
little
as
possible
.
<EOS>
They
assure
her
she
need
have
no
apprehension
on
that
score
,
and
express
great
anxiety
as
to
what
would
befal
her
when
they
be
pone
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
not
desire
to
shed
blood
,
if
it
can
be
help
,
"
say
Stephen
Littleton
;
"
but
in
a
case
of
necessity
,
like
the
present
,
where
life
must
be
weigh
against
life
,
I
hold
it
lawful
to
shed
it
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
put
the
trooper
to
death?""not
unless
your
own
safety
require
it
,
good
sir
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
quit
this
cottage
soon
after
you
have
leave
it
,
and
obtain
a
safe
asylum
with
one
of
my
neighbour
.
<EOS>
It
matter
not
what
become
of
me
.
<EOS>
have
lose
my
two
sons,—for
I
consider
them
as
already
dead,—I
have
nothing
leave
to
bind
me
to
life

<EOS>
"unable
<EOS>
to
make
any
reply
,
the
conspirator
remain
for
some
time
silent
,
when
,
by
the
poor
woman
's
advice
,
they
withdraw
to
an
upper
chamber
,
and
stretch
themselves
on
a
bed
,
seek
a
few
hour
'
repose
.
<EOS>
the
old
woman
keep
watch
below
,
and
they
give
her
one
of
the
petronel
,
with
strict
injunction
to
blow
out
the
trooper
's
brain
if
he
attempt
to
move
.
<EOS>
nothing
,
however
,
occur
to
alarm
her
,
and
at
three
o'clock
she
awaken
them
.
<EOS>
offer
the
woman
a
handsome
reward
,
which
,
however
,
she
decline
,
they
then
set
out
;
and
shortly
afterwards
their
hostess
quit
her
habitation
,
and
withdraw
to
the
cottage
of
a
neighbour
,
where
she
remain

for
some
week
,
and
then
die
of
grief

that
her
son

during
the
assault

Holbeach
by
the
royalist

<EOS>
recruit
by
the
rest
they
have
enjoy

the
conspirator
pursue
their
course
over
the
field

<EOS>
the
weather
be
the
same
as
that
which
dishearten
their
confederate
at
Holbeach
,
and
the
rain
fall
so
heavily
that
they
have
soon
not
a
dry
thread
upon
them
.
<EOS>
but
be
now
disguise
,
they
be
not
under
so
much
apprehension
of
detection
.
<EOS>
shape
their
course
towards
Rowley
Regis
,
in
Staffordshire
,
which
lie
about
five
mile
from
Hagley
,
where
a
farmer
name
Pelborrow
,
a
tenant
of
Humphrey
Littleton
,
reside
,
and
whom
they
think
would
befriend
them
,
they
proceed
swiftly
on
their
way
;
but
,
though
well
acquaint
with
the
country
,
they
be
so
bewilder
and
deceive
by
the
fog
,
that
they
stray
materially
out
of
their
course
,
and
when
it
grow
light
find
themselves
near
Weoley
Castle
,
and
about
four
mile
from
Birmingham
.
<EOS>
confide
in
their
disguise
,
and
in
their
power
of
sustain
the
character
they
assume
,
they
get
into
the
high
road
,
and
approach
a
farm
-
house
,
Stephen
Littleton
,
who
have
tie
his
companion

arm
behind
him
with
his
belt
,
represent
himself
as
a
trooper

a
prisoner
from
Stourbridge
to
Birmingham
,
and
in
consequence
of
this
obtain
a
breakfast
from
the
farmer
.
<EOS>
after
their
meal
be
over
,
the
host
,
who
have
eye
them
suspiciously
,
observe
to
the
supposed
trooper,—"You
will
overtake
some
of
your
comrade
before
you
reach
Egbaston
,
and
have
better
lose
no
time
in

<EOS>
You

my
master

"
he
add
,
in
a
tone
that
could
not
be
hear
by
the
household
;
"
but
I
will
not
betray
you
.
<EOS>
get
you
go
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
conspirator
do
not
fail
to
act
upon
the
suggestion
,
and
as
soon
as
they
get
out
of
sight
,
strike
across
the
county
in
the
direction
of
Rowley
Regis
,
and
arrive
at
the
farm
-
house
which
be
their
destination
in
about
an
hour
.
<EOS>
Pelborrow
chance
to
be
in
a
barn
adjoin
his
house
,
and
alone
,
and
on
see
them
readily
offer
to
hide
them
.
<EOS>
no
one
have
notice
their
approach
,
and
carefully
conceal
them
amid
the
hay
in
the
loft
,
he
proceed
about
his
business
as
if
nothing
have
happen
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
just
then
procure
them
provision
without
exciting
suspicion
;
but
when
night
arrive
bring
them
a
sufficient
supply
for
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
they
pass
nearly
a
week
,
never
venture
to
stir
forth
,
for
they
have
be
trace
to
the
neighbourhood
,
and
constant
search
be
go
on
after
them
.
<EOS>
Pelborrow
have
great
difficulty
in
keep
his
man
out
of
the
barn
,
and
the
disappearance
of
the
provision
excite
the
suspicion
of
his
female
domestic
,
who
begin
to
think
all
be
not
right
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
intimate
to
the
conspirator
that
they
must
change
their
quarter
,
and
in
the
dead
of
the
night
,
they
remove
to
the
house
of
another
farmer
name
Perkes
,
reside
on
the
border
of
Hagley
Park
,
to
whom
Pelborrow
have
confide
the
secret
of
their
being
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
who
,
on
promise
of
a
large
reward
,
readily
undertake
to
secrete
them
.
<EOS>
perke
meet
them
at
a
little
distance
from
his
house
,
and
conduct
them
to
a
barley
-
mow
,
where
he
have
contrive
a
hiding
-
place
amid
the
straw
for
them
.
<EOS>
a
woman

servant
and
a
man

both
let
into
the
secret
by
Perkes
,
and
a
sum
of
money
,
give
him
for
that
purpose
by
the
conspirator
,
bribe
them
to
silence
.
<EOS>
here
they
remain
close
prisoner
,
unable
to
stir
forth
,
or
even
to
change
their
habiliment
for
nearly
six
week
,
during
which
time
they
receive
constant
intelligence
from
their
protector
of
what
be
go
forward
,
and
learn
that
the
search
for
them
have
not

.
<EOS>
They
be
not
without
hope
,
however
,
that
the
bad
be
over
,
when
an
incident
occur
that
give
them
serious
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
one
night
,
Perkes
,
who
be
a
stout
,
hale
yeoman
,
and
have
formerly
be
warren
to
Mrs.
Littleton
,
go
to
catch
cony
,
with
a
companion
name
Poynter
,
and
return
laden
with
spoil
.
<EOS>
after
drink
a
cup
or
two
of
ale
together
,
the
pair
separate
,
and
Poynter
feel
fatigue
with
his
exertion
,
as
well
as
drowsy
with
the
liquor
he
have
swallow
,
determine
to
pass
the
night
in
his
friend
's
barn
,
and
enter
it
,
clamber
up
to
the
loft
,
and
lay
himself
in
the
straw
.
<EOS>
in
do
this
,
he
slip
into
the
hole
make
for
the
conspirator
,
who
,
arouse
by
his
fall
,
instantly
seize
him
.
<EOS>
terrified
to
death
,
and
fancy
he
have
fall
into
the
hand
of
gipsy
or
other
plunderer
,
Poynter
roar
for
mercy
,
which
they
be
not
at
first
dispose
to
show
him
;
but
the
poor
wretch
,
find
into
whose
hand
he
have
fall
,
besought
them
in
such
piteous
term
to
spare
his
life
,
affirm
with
the
strong
oath
that
he
would
never
betray
them
,
that
they
consent
to
spare
him
,
on
condition
of
his
remain
with
them
as
long
as
they
should
occupy
their
place
of
concealment
.
<EOS>
when
Perkes
appear
in
the
morning
,
he
be
not
a
little
surprised
at
find
his
comrade
catch
in
such
a
trap
,
but
entirely
approve
of
the
course
take
by
the
conspirator
.
<EOS>
Poynter
,
as
may
be
suppose
,
be
no
willing
captive
;
and
be
constantly
ponder
on
the
mean
of
escape
,
and
of
obtain
the
reward
for
the
apprehension
of
the
conspirator
,
at
last
hit
upon
the
following
expedient
.
<EOS>
while
engage
in
the
poaching
expedition
with
Perkes
,
he
have
receive
a
slight
wound
in
the
leg
,
and
the
close
confinement
to
which
he
be
now
subject
inflame
it
to
such
a
degree
as
to
render
it
highly
dangerous
.
<EOS>
this
he
represent
to
the
conspirator
,
who
,
however
,
would
not
suffer
him
to
depart
;
but
desire
Perkes
to
bring
him
some
ointment
to
dress
his
wound
.
<EOS>
the
request
be
comply
with
,
and
feign
that
it
be
necessary
to
approach
the
light
to
apply
the
salve
,
Poynter
scramble
up
the
straw
,
apparently
for
that
sole
purpose
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
attempt
to
fly
for
several
day
;
but
at
last
,
when
they
be
grow
less
suspicious
,
he
slide
down
the
other
side
of
the
loft
,
and
make
good
his
retreat
.
<EOS>
the
conspirator
see
the
error
they
have
commit
when
too
late
.
<EOS>
not
dare
to
pursue
him
,
they
remain
in
fearful
anticipation
of
an
arrest
throughout
the
day
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
not
disturb
until
night
,
when
Perkes
make
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
They
tell
him
what
have
happen
;
but
he
do
not
appear
to
be
much
alarm
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
not
think
you
need
be
afraid
of
him
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
let
me
have
some
money
,
and
I
will
go
in
quest
of
him
at
once

""Here

I
will
answer
for

<EOS>
They
have

many
danger
and
difficulty
on

overcome
with
fatigue
and
anxiety

<EOS>
fearful

avoid
all
the
large
town
in
the
way
,
and
have
consequently
be
drive
greatly
out
of
the
direct
course
.
<EOS>
He
have
assume
the
disguise
which
he
usually
wear
when
travel

that
of
a
lawyer
,
and
as
he
possess
great
mimetic
talent
,
he
sustain
the
character
admirably
.
<EOS>
Viviana
pass
for
his
daughter
,
and
his
servant
,
Nicholas
Owen
,
who
be
almost
as
clever
an
actor
as
his
master
,
represent
his
clerk
,
while
the
two
attendant
perform
the
part
of
client
.
<EOS>
at
abbots'-bromley
,
where
they
halt
for
refreshment
on
the
second

have
spend
the
night
at
a
small

on
the

of
a
magistrate

Garnet
give
so
plausible
an
account
of
himself
that
the
party
be
instantly
set
at
liberty
,
and
arrive
without
further
molestation
at
their
journey
's
end
.
<EOS>
Viviana
's
last
visit
to
the
hall
have
be
sad
enough
,
but
it
be
not
so
sad
as
the
present
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
dull
November
evening
,
and
the
wind
moan
dismally
through
the
tree

scatter
the
yellow

<EOS>
the

look
forlorn

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
the
drawbridge

down

as
they

the
hollow
trampling
of
their
steed
upon
the
planks
vibrate
painfully
upon
Viviana
's
heart
.
<EOS>
before
dismount
,
she
cast
a
wistful
look
around

,
where

the

and
the
surround
wood

which
she
have
never
look
upon
,
even
on
a
dreary
day
like
the
present
,
and
when
they
be
rob
in
some
measure
of
their
beauty

without
delight

<EOS>
scan
the

she
trace
all
its

every
piece

inspire
you
with
just
indignation
against

how
many

whose
sole
fault
be
their
adherence
to
the

and
their
refusal
to
subscribe
to
doctrine
against
which
their

revolt

have
be
put
to
death
like
your
father

nay

have
endure
a
bad
fate

for
they
have
languish
out
their

in
prison

while
their
family

undergo
every

how

deliver
to
bondage

their

behold
this
miserable

denunciation

<EOS>
what
I

what
I
pray

be
toleration

<EOS>
the
suffering
of
our

will
not

be
in

if
they
enable
our

to
worship
God
in
their

accord
to
the

<EOS>
the
ruthless
conduct
of
our
persecutor
must
be
hold
in
as
much
abhorrence

all

our
persecution
of
that
sect

I
can
not
believe
that
by
persecution
we
can
work
out
the
charitable
precept
inculcate
by
our
Saviour

I
be
sure
such
a
course
be
as
adverse
to
the
spirit
of
religion
as
it
be
to
that
of
humanity

<EOS>
let
us
bear
our
sorrow
with
patience,—let
us
utter
no
repining

but
turn
the
other
cheek
to
the
smiter
,
and
we
shall
find
,
in
due
time

that
the
heart

our
oppressor

relent

that
all
the
believer

Viviana

I
be
content
to
think

accord
to
my
own
feeling

conviction

I
will
not
give
up
the
hope
that
in
some
milder
and
wise
age
,
persecution
on
either
side
will
cease

the
suffering
of

remember

surely
it

""not

"
<EOS>
an
action
be
not
to
be
judge
or
justify
by
the
event
attend
it
,
but
by
its
own
intrinsic
merit

<EOS>
to
aver
the
contrary
be
to
throw
a
doubt
upon
the
Holy
Scriptures
themselves
,
where
we
read
in
the
Book
of
Judges
that
the
eleven
tribe
of
Israel
be
command
to
make
war
upon
the
tribe
of
Benjamin
,

yet
be
twice
defeat

We
have
fail
.
<EOS>
but
this
prove
nothing
against
our
project

which
I
maintain
to
be
righteous
and
praiseworthy
,
undertake
to
overthrow
an
heretical
and
excommunicate
monarch
,

to
re
-
establish
the
true
faith

the
most
high
throughout

""I
lament

you
can
not

I

the

an
offence
alike

rejoice

have
you
do
our

an
injury

justify

further
persecution

""no

look

we

It

It

<EOS>
He

an

<EOS>
when
Catesby

fresh

while
Oldcorne

well
accommodate

<EOS>
this
leniency
be
the
result
of
the
policy
of

who
hope
to
obtain
disclosure
from
the
two
Jesuit
priest

would
enable

unsuccessful

<EOS>
They
refuse
to
make
any
confession

would

and
as
none
of
the
conspirator

not
even
Tresham

have
admit
their
connexion
with
the
plot

it
be
difficult
to
find
proof

we

recourse

""Minare

I

perhaps
be

worthy
