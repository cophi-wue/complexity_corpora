and
lodge
in
Edgar
's
Tower
,
an
old
fortified
gate
-
house
at
the
entrance
of
the
cathedral
close
.
<EOS>
never
have
Worcester
be
so
gloomy
and
despondent
as
at
this
period
.
 
<EOS>
nor
do
the
hope
of
the
loyal
citizen
revive
till
the
middle
of
August
,
1651
,
when
intelligence
be
receive
that
Charles
,
who
have
be
recently
crown
at
Scone
,
have
escape
Cromwell
's
vigilance
,
and
cross
the
border
with
a
considerable
army
,
have
pursue
the
direct
route
to
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
thence
<EOS>
he
continue
his
rapid
march
through
Preston
to
Warrington
,
where
he
force
the
bridge
over
the
Mersey
,
in
spite
of
the
effort
of
Generals
Lambert
and
Harrison
to
arrest
his
progress
.
<EOS>
the
young
king
,
it
be
say
,
be
make
his
way
to
his
faithful
city
of
Worcester
,
where
he
mean
to
establish
his
head-
quarter
and
recruit
his
force
before
march
on
London
.
 
<EOS>
the
news
seem
too
good
to
be
true
,
yet
it
obtain
ready
credence
,
and
it
be
evident
Colonel
James
believe
it
,
for
he
forthwith
begin
to
put
the
fortification
in
order
.
<EOS>
the
commandant
,
in
fact
,
have
receive
a
despatch
from
General
Lambert
,
inform
him
that
he
and
General
Harrison
have
fail
in
prevent
the
young
king
of
Scots
from
pass
the
bridge
over
the
Mersey
at
Warrington
,
and
have
be
disappoint
in
their
expectation
that
he
would
give
them
battle
on
Knutsford
Heath
,
where
they
await
him
.
 
<EOS>
favour
by
night
,
the
young
king
have
continue
his
march
unmoleste
,
it
be
understand
from
prisoner
they
have
take
,
that
he
be
make
for
Worcester
.
<EOS>
Charles
Stuart
's
force
,
Lambert
say
,
have
be
greatly
reduce
by
desertion
since
he
enter
England
,
and
now
amount
to
no
more
than
eight
thousand
infantry
and
three
thousand
horse
,
and
he
be
only
provide
with
sixteen
leathern
gun
.
<EOS>
as
yet
he
have
obtain
few
recruit
,
the
country
gentleman
hold
aloof
,
or
be
prevent
by
the
militia
from
join
his
standard
.
<EOS>
but
the
Earl
of
Derby
have
undertake
to
raise
large
levy
in
Lancashire
and
Cheshire
,
and
have
be
leave
behind
by
the
king
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
defeat
the
earl
's
design
that
the
two
Parliamentary
general
deem
it
expedient
to
remain
where
they
be
rather
than
pursue
the
royal
army
.
<EOS>
many
malignant
,
papist
,
and
Presbyterians
,
ill
affect
towards
the
Commonwealth
,
would
doubtless
join
Lord
Derby
,
who
,
unless
he
be
speedily
discomfited
,
may
become
formidable
.
<EOS>
but
discomfit
he
assuredly
would
be
,
and
his
force
scatter
like
chaff
,
since
the
Lord
would
fight
on
the
side
of
his
elect
.
<EOS>
this
good
work
achieve
,
the
two
general
would
hasten
to
the
relief
of
Worcester
.
<EOS>
speedy
succour
may
also
be
expect
from
the
Lord
General
Cromwell
,
who
be
in
close
pursuit
of
the
Scots
'
king
,
at
the
head
of
twelve
thousand
cavalry
and
infantry
.
<EOS>
Colonel
James
be
,
therefore
,
exhort
to
hold
out
.
 
<EOS>
General
Lambert
further
state
in
his
despatch
,
that
Charles
be
accompany
by
the
most
experienced
leader
in
the
scottish
army
--
by
the
crafty
and
cautious
Colonel
Lesley
,
who
have
so
long
baffle
Cromwell
himself
--
by
Generals
Montgomery
,
Middleton
,
Massey
,
and
Dalyell
,
and
by
the
valiant
Colonel
Pitscottie
,
with
his
Highland
regiment
.
<EOS>
besides
these
,
there
be
several
English
and
Scotch
noble
,
the
Dukes
of
Buckingham
and
Hamilton
,
the
earl
of
Rothes
,
Lauderdale
,
Carnworth
,
and
Cleveland
;
Lords
Spyne
,
Sinclair
,
and
Wilmot
;
Sir
John
Douglas
,
Sir
Alexander
Forbes
,
and
other
.
 
<EOS>
while
scan
this
impose
list
,
and
reflect
that
the
royal
force
number
at
least
eleven
thousand
man
,
Colonel
James
ask
himself
how
he
could
possibly
hold
out
against
them
with
a
garrison
of
only
five
hundred
?
<EOS>
He
be
ill
supply
with
cannon
and
ammunition
,
and
the
fortification
be
ruinous
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
the
citizen
be
hostile
,
and
so
far
from
lend
him
aid
,
be
ready
to
rise
in
favour
of
the
king
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
to
contend
against
foe
within
as
well
as
enemy
without
.
<EOS>
His
position
seem
desperate
,
and
though
as
brave
a
man
as
need
be
,
he
be
fill
with
misgiving
.
 
<EOS>
before
proceed
,
it
may
be
proper
to
ascertain
how
far
the
old
city
be
capable
of
defence
.
<EOS>
five
year
previously
it
have
stand
a
lengthen
siege
,
but
the
circumstance
then
be
wholly
different
,
for
the
citizen
be
array
against
the
besieger
,
and
fight
obstinately
.
<EOS>
the
wall
be
much
damage
at
that
time
,
and
have
only
be
partially
repair
,
<EOS>
consequently
the
tower
and
bastion
be
in
a
dilapidated
state
.
<EOS>
outside
the
wall
,
on
the
south
-
east
,
there
be
a
strong
detached
fort
of
recent
construction
.
<EOS>
the
castle
,
which
in
day
of
yore
rise
proudly
on
the
south
side
of
the
cathedral
,
completely
command
the
navigation
of
the
Severn
,
have
long
since
be
pull
down
,
the
only
vestige
of
it
leave
be
some
fragment
of
the
donjon
.
<EOS>
the
mound
on
which
the
mighty
fabric
once
stand
could
have
be
easily
fortify
,
if
time
have
permit
,
and
would
have
form
an
important
work
.
<EOS>
the
city
,
which
be
of
great
antiquity
,
have
four
gate
,
each
flank
with
tower
.
<EOS>
the
strong
resemble
a
barbican
,
and
command
the
quay
and
the
ancient
stone
bridge
across
the
river
.
<EOS>
on
the
north
be
the
Foregate
,
"
a
fair
piece
of
work
,
"
as
it
be
describe
by
old
Leland
,
and
not
far
from
it
be
St.
Martin's
-
gate
.
<EOS>
on
the
south
be
Sidbury
-
gate
,
give
access
to
the
London
-
road
.
<EOS>
the
Sidbury
-
gate
be
cover
by
the
modern
detach
fort
to
which
reference
have
already
be
make
.
<EOS>
deep
dyke
,
supply
by
the
Severn
,
strengthen
the
defence
on
the
east
and
south
-
east
,
but
the
suburb
constitute
a
danger
,
since
the
habitation
would
afford
shelter
to
an
enemy
.
<EOS>
thus
it
will
be
see
that
the
city
be
not
in
a
condition
to
stand
a
siege
,
and
the
commandant
may
well
despair
of
hold
out
,
even
for
a
few
day
,
against
the
royal
force
.
 
<EOS>
no
city
can
be
more
charmingly
situate
than
Worcester
on
the
bank
of
England
's
noblest
river
,
in
the
midst
of
fair
and
fertile
plain
,
abound
in
orchard
and
hop
-
garden
,
and
in
full
view
of
the
lovely
Malvern
Hills
;
but
in
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
it
be
eminently
picturesque
,
as
well
as
beautiful
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
full
of
ancient
timber
house
,
with
quaintly
carve
gable
and
open
balcony
,
from
the
midst
of
which
rise
the
massive
roof
and
tower
of
the
venerable
cathedral
,
and
the
lofty
spire
of
St.
Andrew
's
Church
.
<EOS>
the
old
wall
,
grey
and
ruinous
as
they
be
,
the
fortified
gate
,
the
sculptured
crosse
,
and
the
antique
stone
bridge
,
with
its
many-
pointed
arch
,
contribute
to
its
beauty
.
<EOS>
the
noble
episcopal
palace
,
the
group
of
old
building
near
the
cathedral
,
and
the
ruin
on
the
Castle
Hill
--
all
form
a
striking
picture
when
see
from
St.
John
's
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
wealth
of
Worcester
standeth
most
by
drapery
,
"
quoth
old
Leland
,
who
write
in
Henry
VIII
's
time
,
and
the
place
have
long
be
note
for
its
broadcloth
and
glove
.
<EOS>
but
many
of
the
wealthy
draper
,
glover
,
and
hop
-
merchant
have
be
ruin
by
the
heavy
fine
inflict
upon
them
by
the
grasp
Parliamentarians
,
and
the
city
have
scarcely
yet
regain
its
former
prosperity
.
 
<EOS>
almost
simultaneously
with
the
arrival
of
General
Lambert
's
despatch
,
a
letter
be
bring
by
a
secret
messenger
to
Mr.
Thomas
Lysons
,
then
mayor
of
Worcester
,
and
an
avow
royalist
.
<EOS>
It
come
from
Captain
Fanshawe
,
the
king
's
secretary
,
and
give
a
very
different
version
of
the
affair
at
Warrington
from
that
furnish
by
Lambert
.
 
<EOS>
accord
to
Fanshawe
,
his
majesty
have
display
great
personal
courage
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
find
the
enemy
,
consist
of
about
seven
thousand
man
,
unite
under
Lambert
and
Harrison
,
in
possession
of
the
bridge
across
the
Mersey
,
which
they
have
partly
break
down
,
and
he
immediately
attack
them
with
his
advanced
troop
.
<EOS>
His
impetuosity
prove
irresistible
.
<EOS>
a
passage
be
force
,
the
whole
army
follow
,
and
the
enemy
retreat
in
great
disorder
,
and
with
heavy
loss
.
<EOS>
during
the
night
,
upwards
of
three
thousand
of
the
"
rebellious
rogue
,
"
as
Fanshawe
style
them
,
disband
.
<EOS>
the
Parliamentary
general
do
not
venture
to
attack
the
king
again
,
but
allow
him
to
continue
his
march
towards
Worcester
without
further
interruption
.
<EOS>
the
faithful
citizen
may
,
therefore
,
prepare
to
welcome
their
sovereign
,
who
would
soon
be
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
mayor
immediately
call
a
public
meeting
in
the
Guildhall
,
and
read
Captain
Fanshawe
's
letter
to
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
Great
be
the
enthusiasm
excite
by
it
.
<EOS>
the
hall
resound
with
cry
of
"
long
live
Charles
II
!
"
<EOS>
the
joyful
intelligence
quickly
spread
throughout
the
city
,
and
crowd
collect
in
the
high
-
street
,
shout
"
down
with
the
Commonwealth
!
<EOS>
up
with
the
Crown

"
<EOS>
the
concourse

and

troop
of
horse
,
but
in
the
conflict
several
person
be

for
that
day
,
at

.
<EOS>
two
-
third
of
the
infantry
be
without
shoe
,
but
be
hardy
scot
they
do
not
count
this
an
inconvenience
.
<EOS>
They
all
bemoan
the
ragged
and
weather
-
stain
condition
of
their
uniform
,
but
they
have
hear
that
Worcester
be
famous
for
broadcloth
,
and
the
king
have
promise
them
well
garment
when
they
reach
the
city

<EOS>
the
morn
be
lovely
,
and
give
promise
of
a
splendid
day

<EOS>
at
that
early
hour
,
the
view
from
the
height
of
the
old
and
picturesque
city
,
with
the
broad
river
flow
past
it
,
be
enchanting
,
and
delight
even
the
rough
soldier
who
gaze
at
it
.
<EOS>
the
fair
Malvern
Hills
,
however
,
chiefly
call
forth
their
admiration
as
remind
them
of
their
native
mountain
,
though
they
admit
that
few
of
the
scottish
valley
could
compare
with
the
fertile
vale
of
the
Severn
.
 
<EOS>
while
many
a
greedy
eye
be
fix
on
Worcester
,
and
many
a
cunning
tongue
be
talk
of
its
wealth
,
and
the
plunder
it
would
yield
,
if
they
be
only
allow
to
pillage
it
,
the
attention
of
the
soldier
be
attract
to
the
wall
,
which
have
now
become
thronged
with
the
citizen
and
their
wife
and
daughter
,
while
all
the
church
bells--
and
no
church
in
the
old
city
lack
its
proper
complement
of
bells--
<EOS>
begin
to
ring
forth
joyous
peal
.
<EOS>
It
be
clear
that
the
city
be
now
awake
and
astir
,
and
the
half
-
famish
soldier
hope
that
immediate
preparation
would
be
make
for
their
refreshment
,
and
on
an
extraordinary
scale
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
about
this
time
that
Major
Careless
,
who
have
attire
himself
rather
hurriedly
,
be
excite
by
the
prodigious
clangour
of
the
bell
,
enter
the
king
's
tent
,
and
find
the
young
monarch
fast
asleep
--
fast
as
a
top

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
mentally

hard

even
so

no

as

infinitely
more
care
on
the

swarthy

handsome

trace

Charles
be
better
pleased
to
see
them
thus
than
if
they
have

in

robe

office

say
so

Mr.

quite
so
stout

both

have
look
exhausted
when
they
arrive

they

up
wonderfully
as

after

contrive
it

"
Your

hear

the
mayor

<EOS>
"
It
will
always
be
a
feather
in
our
cap
to
have
escape
from
Colonel
James
.
<EOS>
with
what
particular
object
he
carry
us
off
we
know
not
,

it
be
certain
he
mean
to
take
us
to
Gloucester

<EOS>
shortly
after
midnight
we

bring
out
of

no

probably
no

at

off

little

soon

a
dreary

singe
Puritans

<EOS>
They
do
not

very
respectfully
of

we
tell
them
a
day
of
reckoning
be
at
hand

that
you
would
drive
them
all
before
you

at
Upton

on

severn

<EOS>
now
the
Roundheads
have
no
especial
dislike
to
ale

cider

do
not

it
sinful

know
the
drink
they
delight
in

to
be
have
in
perfection
at
the
Red
Lion

at

they
rouse
the
house

compel
the
host
and
tapster
to
broach
a
cask
of
stout
March
ale

another
of
cider

<EOS>
the
trooper

dismount
,

tie
up
their
horse

they
empty
their
can

Ezra

flight

any
favourable
opportunity

the

<EOS>
be

Most

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
another
person
whom

be
Doctor

dinner
be

<EOS>

<EOS>
the

the

<EOS>
Grace
be
say
by
Doctor
Crosby
,
We
shall
not
particularise
the
dish
,
but
we
must
mention
that
a
severn
salmon
of
prodigious
weight
--
quite
a
regal
fish
,
that
have
allow
itself
obligingly
to
be
capture
for
the
occasion
--
be
set
before
the
king

<EOS>
moreover
,
the
stewed
lamprey
be
an
entirely
new
delicacy
to
his

please
him
greatly

<EOS>
Charles
be
in
high
spirit
,
and
laugh
and
jest
in
the
most
good-
humoured
manner
with
those
near
him
.
<EOS>
of
a
very
sanguine
temperament
,
he
have
never
doubt
the
success
of
his
expedition
,
and
the
events--
unimportant
as
they
be
--
that
have
occur
since
his
arrival
before
Worcester
heighten
his
confidence
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
he
have
be
victorious
,
and
have
be
warmly
welcome
by
his
subject
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
assure
that
a
great
number
of
recruit
could
be
raise
in
the
county
before
the
general
Muster
take
place
at
Pitchcroft
,
and
he
feel
certain
Lord
Derby
would
bring
him
large
levy
from
Lancashire
and
Cheshire
.
<EOS>
He
would
then
give
battle
to
Cromwell
,
defeat
him
,
and
march
on
triumphantly
to
London
.
<EOS>
His
confidence
seem
to
be
share
by
all
the
noble
and
general
officer
present
--
even
by
the
cold
and
cautious
Lesley

<EOS>
while
quaff

<EOS>
all
the

Worcester

abound
in
churches--
be
fill
with
congregation
in

the
military
element

attend
divine
service
there
--

all

<EOS>
never

have
the

Its

this

which
the
service
of
the
Church
of
England
have
be
perform
within
the
cathedral
since
its
desecration

it

be
conceive
with
what
satisfaction
the
member
of
that
religion
be
enable
to
resume
their
own
form
of
worship
within
it

and
this
satisfaction

heighten
by
the
circumstance
under

<EOS>
the
organ

the
military

substitute
seem
not
inappropriate
to

occasion

hymn

<EOS>
certe

the
drum

trumpet

speedily
fall

rebellion

which

stalk
un

the

<EOS>
to
Charles
he
attribute
the
high
spiritual
authority

and
speak
of
him
as
"
in
all
cause

and
over
all
person

next
under
God

supreme
head
and
governor"--expression
at
which
his
presbyterian
hearer
take
great
offence

<EOS>
the
earnestness

however
,
of
his
manner
could
not
fail
to
impress
them
with
a
conviction

<EOS>
a

it

on

<EOS>
yes

the

village
of
Malvern

<EOS>
where

on
the
hillside--
where
countless
white
villa
peer
from
out
the
tree
,
contrast
charmingly
with
the
foliage
,
and
help
to
form
one
of
the
pretty
town
in
England
--
a

as

as

nothing
be

to

a

<EOS>
in

which

the
old

and
the
beautiful
gateway

<EOS>
the

devotee

such

and
Malvern
remain
an
obscure
,
unfrequented
village
,
until
its
beauty
and
salubrity
be
discover
in
the
early
part
of
the
present
century
.
 
<EOS>
Charles
and
his
attendant
halt
on
the
ridge
on
which
this
charming
town
be
now
build
,
and
survey
the
extensive
prospect
it
command
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
aware
that
they
be
watch
from
behind
a
tree
by
a
tall
,
ill
-
favoured
man
,
in
the
garb
of
a
Puritan
.
<EOS>
this
eave
-
dropper
,
who
have
follow
them
cautiously
for
some
minute
,
ascertain
their
purpose
,
and
as
soon
as
they
begin
to
ascend
the
hill
,
he
hurry
down
to
the
little
inn
near
the
priory
gate
.
 
<EOS>
all
difficulty
in
the
ascent
of
the
lofty
hill
,
know
as
the
Worcestershire
Beacon
,
have
now
be
remove
,
and
well
-
make
path
enable
even
invalid
to
reach
its
summit
almost
without
fatigue
.
<EOS>
but
at
the
time
when
Charles
and
his
attendant
mount
it
,
it
have
a
stern
,
solitary
air
,
and
its
silence
be
unbroken
by
any
sound
except
that
of
the
sheep
-
bell
,
or
the
cry
of
a
bird
of
prey
.
<EOS>
sheep
-
track
alone
lead
up
its
rugged
side
,
and
conduct
the
pedestrian
through
the
broad
patch
of
furze
,
or
past
huge
protruding
rock
,
to
the
smooth
turf
above
.
<EOS>
Charles
be
a
dare
horseman
,
take
the
near
road
,
and
not
unfrequently
come
to
place
where
it
be
too
steep
to
proceed
with
safety
,
and
have
to
retrace
his
course
and
seek
a
less
dangerous
ascent
.
<EOS>
the
only
person
in
sight
be
a
shepherd
tend
his
flock
,
and
he
be
far
off
.
<EOS>
at
length
the
king
and
his
attendant
gain
the
rounded
summit
of
the
hill
,
which
be
cover
by
turf
smooth
as
velvet
,
and
fragrant
with
thyme
.
 
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
both
Charles
and
Careless
have
be
too
much
occupy
by
the
difficulty
of
the
ascent
to
pay
much
attention
to
the
vast
panorama
opening
upon
them
as
they
mount
the
hill
.
<EOS>
but
as
they
now
gaze
upon
it
,
they
be
lose
in
admiration
,
and
quite
forget
the
trouble
they
have
experience
.
 
<EOS>
It
boot
not
to
describe
the
thought
that
pass
through
the
king
's
breast
,
as
his
eye
range
over
that
astonishing
prospect
,
which
,
comprehend
as
it
do
nine
or
ten
county
,
show
him
a
large
portion
of
his
kingdom
,
and
that
perhaps
not
the
least
beautiful
portion
.
<EOS>
how
many
town
and
village
--
how
many
noble
mansion
--
could
he
count
in
that
wide
-
spread
landscape
!
<EOS>
on
the
left
,
and
almost
as
it
seem
at
his
foot
,
lie
the
old
and
faithful
City
of
Worcester
,
with
his
army
encamp
around
it
.
<EOS>
two
other
cathedral
town
,
with
their
church
tower
and
steeple
--
Gloucester
and
Hereford
--
could
likewise
be

<EOS>
Charles
seek
the
severn
for
some
time
in
vain

<EOS>
owe
to
the
height
of
its
bank
,
it
could
only
be
here
and
there
discern
.
 
<EOS>
He
hang
long
upon
this
incomparable
prospect
,
and
then
turn
to
the
Herefordshire
side
of
the
hill
,
whence
<EOS>
the
view
be
almost
equally
fine
,
three
distinct
mountainous
chain
,
of
beautifully
varied
form
,
meet
his
gaze
.
 
<EOS>
on
quit
the
green
sward
the
peril
of
the
descent
commence
,
and
they
be
oblige
to
proceed
with
caution
,
the
ground
be
cover
with
loose
stone
and
fragment
of
rock
.
<EOS>
They
proceed
singly
,
Charles
take
the
lead
,
and
be
skirt
a
huge
mass
of
granite
that
obstruct
their
course
,
when
suddenly
half
a
dozen
man
,
arm
with
musket
,
whose
steel
cap
and
buff
coat
show
they
be
Parliamentary
soldier

and
who
have
evidently
be
lie
in
ambush
behind
the
rock
,
spring
forward
,
one
of
them
seize
the
king

bridle
,
and
two
other
forcibly
prevent
him
from
use
his
arm

<EOS>
Careless
be
treat
in
precisely
the
same
manner
,
and
the
capture
be
so
quickly
execute
that
it
be
perfectly
successful

<EOS>
at
the
same
time
two
person
appear
on
the
top
of
the
rock
,
which
rise
to
some
little
height
above
them
.
<EOS>
in
one
of
these
Careless
recognise
Colonel
James
;
the
other
,
who
keep
back
,
be
the

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
cry
Charles
,
furiously
,
as
he
vainly
attempt
to
free
himself
from
the
grasp
of
the
soldier

hold
him

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
scarcely
be
the
word
utter
than
a
loud
report
be
hear
,
and
he
drop
on
the
rock
,
apparently
mortally
wound

<EOS>
"
the
Amalekites

upon
us

so
say
,
he
jump
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
rock

disappear

<EOS>
suppose
their
commander
kill

next

from
among

Sir

thus
enjoin

yonder

we

your

We
could
see
you
both
quite
distinctly
,
and
our
gaze
never
quit
you
till
you
be
about
to
commence
your

I
then
beg
my

down

Your

in

I
notice
some
armed

stealthily
about

point
them
out
to
my
brother

Sir

<EOS>
a
glance
of
triumph
light
up
her
fine
eye
as
Charles
address
her
:
 
<EOS>
"
You
only
want
arm
to
become
a
veritable
Amazon
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
wear
them
if
your
majesty
command

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
you
have
bring
me
so
many
recruit
that
it
be
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
how
many
troop
have
you
help
to
fill
up
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
do
my
good
,
sire
,
but
I
have
not
bring
you
half
so
many
as
I
could
desire
.
<EOS>
the
Worcestershire
gentry
be
loyal
,
but
irresolute
and
cautious
--
I
will
not
use
strong
epithet
.
<EOS>
They
try
to
excuse
their
lukewarmness
on
the
ground
that
they
suffer
so
much
from
fine
and
sequestration
during
the
Civil
Wars
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
tell
them
,
that
be
no
excuse
.
<EOS>
They
ought
to
risk
all
--
sacrifice
all
,
if
need
be
--
for
their
sovereign
.
<EOS>
many
have
come
here
to

day

with
a

grief

indignation

some

I
fully
count
,
be
absent

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
scarcely
miss
them
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
win
a
battle
,
they
will
hasten
to
rally
round
my
standard
,
but
I
shall
know
how
to
distinguish
between
late
comer
,
and
those
who
have
be
true
to
me
in
the
hour
of
peril

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
all
here
be
true
man
,
my
liege

<EOS>
I
would
not
say
as
much
for
yon
scottish
soldier

"
<EOS>
then
lower
her
voice
so
as
only
to
be
hear
by
the
king

she
add
:
"
do
not

Lesley

He
may
play
you
false

"
 
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
entertain
these
suspicion

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

from
what
I

Heaven
grant
my
fear
may
prove
groundless

<EOS>
"
if
Lesley
prove

undo

the

obey
no

I

"
 
<EOS>
"
what

<EOS>
banish
the
gloom
that
have
gather
on
his
brow
during
his
converse
with
Jane

he
turn
to
Captain
Hornyold

and
delight
that
loyal
gentleman
by
his
praise

have
complete
his

new

towards
the
centre
of
the

Pitscottie

his

be
draw
up

<EOS>
here
he
station
himself
,
and
immediately
afterwards
it
become
evident
,
from
the
movement
that
take
place
,
that
the
recruit
be
about
to
march
past

<EOS>
with
as
much
promptitude

precision
as
if
they
have
belong
to
the
regular
cavalry

Captain
Hornyold

up

each

they

deserve
his
praise

for
a
fine
set

man
be
never

<EOS>
almost
all
of
them
be
in
the
full
vigour
of
manhood
,
and
the
ardour
display
in
their
look
and
bear
,
and
in
the
shout
they
could
not
repress
,
form
a
striking
contrast
to
the
sullen
visage
and
moody
silence
of
the
scottish
soldier
,
who
seem
to
regard
their
new
comrade
with
aversion
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
coldness
of
the
Scots
be
more
than
compensate
for
by
the
genuine
enthusiasm
of
the
citizen
,
<EOS>
who
put
no
bound
to
their
rapturous
delight

and
shout
lustily
as
the
new

chapter

.
<EOS>
the
BIVOUAC
on
<EOS>
the
PLAIN
 
shortly
after
the
king
's
departure
,
two
of
the
newly
-
raise
regiment
proceed
to
the
quarter
temporarily
assign
them
in
the
city
.
<EOS>
next
day
they
encamp
on
the
west
side
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
the
regiment
leave
behind
remain
where
they
be
,
and
commence
their
experience
of
military
life
by
bivouac
on
the
plain
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
undergo
much
hardship
,
since
the
night
be
fine
and
warm
,
and
the
moon
be
nearly
at
the
full
,
every
object
be
as
distinctly
visible
as
during
daytime
.
 
<EOS>
as
far
as
eatable
and
drinkable
be
concern
,
the
newly
-
enrol
troop
have
no
reason
to
complain
.
<EOS>
plenty
of
provision
and
an
abundant
supply
of
good
liquor
--
ale
,
perry
,
cider
,
canary
,
sack
,
and
other
wine
,
be
send
them
by
the
mayor
and
sheriff
.
<EOS>
though
novice
in
the
art
of
war
,
the
new
soldier
be
adept
in
drinking
,
and
could
empty
their
cup
as
well
as
the
old
campaigner
.
<EOS>
every
Cavalier
be
welcome
to
a
share
of
their
runlet
of
sack
or
claret
--
but
they
do
not
invite
the
scottish
soldier
.
 
<EOS>
though
the
night
be
fine
and
warm
,
as
we
have
describe
,
they
keep
up
their
fire
,
and
sit
around
them
to
a
late
hour
.
<EOS>
these
group
,
with
arm
pile
,
and
horse
picket
beside
them
,
lend
a
very
picturesque
appearance
to
this
part
of
the
plain
.
<EOS>
further
on
could
be
see
the
tent
of
the
scottish
soldier
,
bathe
in
moonlight
,
but
few
be
stir
near
them
except
the
sentinel
.
<EOS>
It
would
almost
seem
as
if
the
Scots
have
retire
to
rest
earlier
than
their
will
not
to
avoid
hear
the
song
and
laughter
of
their
roystering
comrade
.
<EOS>
a
great
noise
be
undoubtedly
make
,
for
a
dozen
cavalier
ditty
be
chant
at
the
same
time
by
different
party
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
however
,
the
recruit
grow
tired
of
singing
,
and
begin
to
talk
of
the
war
.
<EOS>
round
each
fire
be
collect
individual
who
have
fight
at
both
siege
of
Worcester
,
and
these
now
favour
their
companion
with
their
recollection
of
those
stirring
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
nine
year
ago
,
"
say
a
burly
-
look
young
man
,
who
have
be
address
as
Martin
Vosper
,
"
<EOS>
I
be
just
nineteen
--
<EOS>
so
you
will
readily
guess
my
age
now
--
<EOS>
and
I
be
then
'
prentice
to
Mr.
Lysons
,
the
present
worthy
mayor
of
Worcester
.
<EOS>
the
city
,
as
you
know
,
have
always
be
loyal
,
and
for
that
reason
be
regard
from
the
very
first
with
especial
disfavour
by
the
rebellious
Parliament
.
<EOS>
in
1642
,
our
faithful
Worcester
,
for
I
love
to
call
it
so
,
declare
for
the
king
,
open
its
gate
to
Sir
John
Biron
and
the
three
hundred
Cavaliers
he
bring
with
him
,
and
fortify
its
wall
.
<EOS>
the
Roundheads
do
not
leave
us
long
alone
.
<EOS>
Lord
Say
and
Colonel
Fynes
,
with
a
large
force
,
lay
siege
to
the
city
;
whereupon
the
king
send
word
from
Oxford
that
he
would
bring
fifteen
hundred
horse
and
twice
as
many
foot
to
raise
the
siege
.
<EOS>
Our
satisfaction
at
this
agreeable
intelligence
be
damp
by
hear
that
Lord
Essex
be
march
against
us
with
fourteen
thousand
man
;
but
just
as
we
be
begin
to
despair
,
Prince
Rupert
,
with
his
brother
Maurice
,
throw
themselves
into
the
city
with
a
large
body
of
troop
.
<EOS>
then
we
feel
able
to
set
Old
Noll
himself
at
defiance
.
<EOS>
two
successful
stratagem
be
practise
.
<EOS>
but
I
must
first
describe
an
action
that
take
place
on
this
very
plain
.
<EOS>
determine
to
strike
a
decisive
blow
before
Lord
Essex
could
bring
up
his
force
,
Prince
Rupert
,
on
the
morning
after
his
arrival
,
with
fifteen
troop
of
horse
,
march
forth
upon
Pitchcroft
,
and
,
sound
his
trumpet
loudly
,
challenge
the
enemy
to
battle
.
<EOS>
a
gallant
sight
his
troop
make
<EOS>
,
I
can
assure
you
,
when
draw
up
on
the
plain
,
for
I
watch
them
from
the
northern
wall
.
<EOS>
a
word
about
the
prince
.
<EOS>
never
do
I
behold
a
fiercer
-
looking
man
.
<EOS>
His
eye
go
through
you
like
a
rapier
.
<EOS>
but
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
at
first
the
enemy
appear
to
decline
the
challenge
,
but
they
be
ready
enough
to
fight
,
as
it
turn
out
,
only
their
force
be
disperse
.
<EOS>
Lord
Say
and
Colonel
Fynes
be
elsewhere
,
as
I
shall
presently
explain
,
but
Colonel
Sandys
and
Colonel
Austine
bring
up
their
regiment
,
and
the
conflict
begin
.
'
<EOS>
Twas
a
splendid
sight
.
<EOS>
what
tremendous
charge
Prince
Rupert
make
!
<EOS>
how
he
mow
down
the
Roundheads
!
<EOS>
still
he
could
not
break
their
rank
.
<EOS>
the
fight
last
for
a
couple
of
hour
with
vary
success
,
but
the
advantage
seem
to
be
with
the
prince
,
when
a
troop
of
horse
be
descry
come
from
the
Blockhouse
field
,
and
a
cry
arise
that
it
be
the
Earl
of
Essex
with
his
reinforcement
.
<EOS>
the
alarm
prove
false
,
for
the
troop
be
those
of
Colonel
Fynes
,
but
on
see
them
,
the
prince
order
an
instant
retreat
,
and
dash
precipitately
into
the
city
,
whither
he
be
follow
so
quickly
by
the
Republicans
,
that
the
gate
could
not
be
shut
,
and
a
desperate
fight
ensue
,
which
last
till
midnight
,
the
street
resound
all
the
time
with
the
rattle
of
musketry
and
the
clash
of
steel
.
<EOS>
many
a
Cavalier
die
that
night
,
but
not
before
his
sword
be
redden
with
the
blood
of
his
adversary
.
<EOS>
the
corn
-
market
be
full
of
wounded
and
die
.
<EOS>
Prince
Rupert
may
have
succeed
in
drive
out
the
Republicans
,
if
they
have
not
be
strongly
reinforce
by
Lord
Say
.
<EOS>
at
length
the
prince
be
compel
to
abandon
the
city
,
but
he
ride
at
the
rear
of
his
troop
and
drive
back
the
Roundheads
who
seek
to
follow
him
across
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
those
confound
Parliamentarians
can
fight
,
it
must
be
own
,
"
remark
one
of
the
listener
.
<EOS>
"
but
what
be
the
stratagem
you
speak
of
just
now
,
Vosper
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
hear
,
Simon
Terret
,
"
reply
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
but
first
give
me
a
cup
of
sack
to
drink
the
king
's
health
,
and
confusion
to
all
rebel
.
<EOS>
from
what
I
be
about
to
relate
you
will
perceive
that
the
conflict
on
Pitchcroft
be
part
of
a
cleverly
-
devise
scheme
,
that
ought
to
have
succeed
better
than
it
do
.
<EOS>
Prince
Rupert
have
ascertain
from
his
scout
that
Lord
Say
have
take
a
detachment
of
a
thousand
man
to
Powick
,
while
another
equally
large
detachment
have
be
take
by
Colonel
Fynes
to
Perry
Wood
--
the
object
of
the
two
republican
commander
be
to
surround
the
prince
,
as
his
highness
perfectly
understand
--
he
endeavour
to
out
-
manuvre
them
.
<EOS>
with
this
design
a
clever
spy
be
send
to
Powick
,
who
represent
himself
as
a
servant
to
the
Earl
of
Essex
,
and
state
,
with
an
air
of
great
plausibility
,
that
Cromwell
have
enter
Worcester
--
and
that
,
if
Lord
say
advanced
immediately
,
the
retreat
of
the
Royalists
would
infallibly
be
cut
off
.
<EOS>
dupe
by
the
man
's
apparent
sincerity
,
Lord
Say
act
on
the
advice
,
and
fall
into
an
ambuscade
that
cost
him
five
-
and
-
twenty
man
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Fynes
be
impose
on
in
much
the
same
manner
.
<EOS>
a
messenger
gallop
up
to
Perry
Wood
and
inform
him
that
Prince
Rupert
be
advance
with
ten
thousand
man
,
whereupon
he
fall
back
four
mile
.
<EOS>
but
he
find
out
the
stratagem
rather
too
soon
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
force
that
subsequently
alarm
Prince
Rupert
and
cause
his
highness
to
retreat
into
the
city
.
<EOS>
have
not
this
discovery
occur
,
the
prince
would
have
beat
the
enemy
in
detail
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
have
hear
that
those
two
clever
spy
be
hang
,
"
remark
Terret
.
 
<EOS>
"
ay
marry
,
be
they
,
"
reply
vosper
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
hang
with
several
other
good
citizen
and
staunch
royalist
on
a
gallow
as
high
as
Haman
's
,

be
necessary
to
take
another
survey
of
them

a
double

the
Severn

the
Moat

wall
behind
it
--
a
boundary
wall

by
a
prior
of
the
Convent
of
St.

early
in

thirteenth

and
form
an
outer
defence
to
the
Castle

with
which
it

<EOS>
the
Castle
Hill
,
as
we
have
already
have
occasion
to
remark
,
be
strongly
fortify
,
and
have
become
almost
as
formidable
as
Fort
Royal
itself
,
with
which
it
be
now
link
by
the
new
line
of
fortification
.
<EOS>
these
new
fortification
be
necessarily
not
very
strong
,
but
they
answer
their
purpose
.
<EOS>
in
the
field
opposite
Friars'-gate
,
and
face
Perry
Wood
,
stand
an
old
blockhouse
,
which
have
more
than
once
fall
into
the

of
the
former
besieger
of
the
city

<EOS>
dismantle
by
Colonel
James

the
Blockhouse

now
be
put
into
repair
,
and

ammunition
,
its
commander
be
Colonel
Blague

on
whose
courage
and
fidelity
Charles
could
perfectly
rely

,
which
look
towards

as
the

after
Charles
's
encampment
upon
it
,
a

bastion
have
be
construct

<EOS>
two
more

the

,
not

the

a

Hodgkins
's
mad
exploit
,
we
come
to
St.
John

,
where
General
Dalyell
's

--
all
the
approach
to
this
outwork
be
as
strongly
barricade
,
as
when
the
dangerous
suburb
form
a
Leaguer
for
the
Parliamentarians
in
1646
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
forego
hasty
survey
,
it
will
be
see
that
the
city
be
now
in
a
thorough
state
of
defence
,
and
be
especially
strong
on
the
south

south

<EOS>
on
the
enemy
's
approach

as
a
precautionary
measure
,
it
be
resolve
by
the
council
of
war
to
burn
all
the
suburb
on
the
north
and
east
--
a
determination
that
inspire
great
terror

since

in
which
the

<EOS>
such
be
the
disposition

when
it

find
that
Cromwell

push
his

on

and
that
the
main

the

<EOS>
His
spirit

with
the
difficulty
he
have
to
encounter

and
his
cheerfulness
and
gaiety
inspire
confidence
in
all
with
whom
he
converse
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
not
overcome
his
suspicion
of
Lesley
,
and
these
suspicion
be
almost
confirm
by
the
conduct
of
the
scottish
leader
,
who
persist
in
maintain
his
post
on
King

Hill
,
whence
secret
communication

Jane

<EOS>
I
may
be
of
some
use

and
my
brother

take
care

"
 
<EOS>
naturally
,
there
be
much
speculation
amongst
the
Royalist
leader
as
to
where
the
attack
would
begin
,
some
mention
one
place
,
some
another
;
but
Jane
venture
to
remark
to
the
king
that
the
first
blow
would

Major

who
have
cross
the
Avon
at
Pershore
on
the
previous
day
,
and
pass
the
night
at
Strensham
,
advance
with
a
regiment
of
horse
and
three
troop
of
dragoon
towards
Upton
Bridge
,
with
the
condition
of
which
he
have
be
make
acquaint
by
the
reconnoitre
party
he
have
send
on
.
<EOS>
no

and
as
he
approach
the

<EOS>
he

shelter
by
the

<EOS>
on
examination
he
find
that
,
although
the
central
arch
of
the
bridge
be
destroy
,
a
plank
have
be
most
incautiously
lay
across
the
pier
for
the
convenience
of
foot
-
passenger
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
not
more
than
three
or
four
dragoon
be
on
guard
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
how
so
important
a
passage
,
on
the
security
of
which
the
royal
army
mainly
depend
,
chance
to
be
so
slenderly
guard
,
seem
inexplicable
to
him
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
greatly
rejoice
,
and
firmly
believe
that
Providence
have
favour
him
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
very
time
when
they
ought
to
have
be
on
the
look
-
out
,
watch
for
their
active
and
daring
foe
,
Massey
's
troop
be
scatter
about
the
single
street
,
which
form
the
quiet
little
town
,
as
careless
and
unconcerned
as
if
no
surprise
be
to
be
apprehend
,
and
the
fate
of
a
great
kingdom
do
not
depend
upon
their
vigilance
.
<EOS>
General
Massey
himself
be
at
breakfast
at
the
little
hostel
,
and
not
a
single
officer
be
on
duty
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
they
be
close
at
hand
,
since
the
street
lead
direct
to
the
bridge
,
but
not
near
enough
,
as
the
event
show
.
 
<EOS>
General
Lambert
could
not
have
choose
a
more
opportune
moment
for
his
approach
.
<EOS>
He
have
take
the
Royalists
completely
unawares
,
and
they
certainly
betray
unpardonable
negligence
.
<EOS>
even
the
few
dragoon
on
guard
seem
half
asleep
,
and
be
recline
drowsily
against
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
peaceful
--
nothing
more
lovely
than
the
scene--
and
yet
<EOS>
how
soon
,
how
terribly
,
be
its
calmness
to
be
disturbed!--it
beauty
destroy
!
<EOS>
round
the
tower
of
the
grey
old
church
the
swallow
be
wheel
<EOS>
;
some
sound
arise
from
the
quiet
little
town
,
but
they
be
not
unpleasant
to
the
ear
;
a
few
bark
be
moor
to
the
bank
below
the
town
,
but
their
owner
seem
infect
by
the
general
indolence
,
as
do
some
other
person
who
be
fish
lower
down
the
stream

<EOS>
the
smooth
,
broad
river
flow
calmly
on

save
where
its
current

the
remain

the
broken

it

the
old
stone
bridge
somewhat
mar
the
peaceful
character
of
the

yet
it

from
its

<EOS>
Lambert
be
strike
with
the
beauty
of
the
view
as
he
gaze
at
it

yet
he

not

the

They

have
they
foolishly
lay
down
a
plank
whereby
we
may

<EOS>
of

this

the

for
the
bullet
of
the
musketeer
kill
them
both

and
their
comrade

<EOS>
by
this
time
the
call

be
loudly
beat

trooper

dragoon
come
rush
from

street

the
scene

<EOS>
but
they

quick
enough
to
prevent

possession

the

his

imprudence

General
Massey
rush
from
the
little
hostel
,
spring
on
his
charger
,
and
gallop
to
the
bridge
,
follow
by
a
small
body
of
cavalry
.
 
<EOS>
His
first
aim
be
to
dislodge
the
detachment
that
have
gain
possession
of
the
church
,
but
when
he
ride
into
the
churchyard
with
his
trooper
for
this
purpose
,
they
be
receive
by
a
well
-
direct
volley
from

that
kill
several
man

horse

throw
the
rest
of

troop
into
confusion

<EOS>
Massey
himself
be
wound
in

<EOS>
nothing
daunt

the
Royalists
ride
close
up
to
the
window
,
fire
their
pistol
into
the
church
,
and
try
to
reach
their
enemy
,
with
their
sword
,
but
do
them
little
hurt

<EOS>
the
Parliamentarians
,
on
the
contrary
,
return
the
fire
with
deadly
effect
,
be
able
to
aim
deliberately
at
their
opponent
.
 
<EOS>
with
the
second
volley
,
the
churchyard
be
strew
with
horse

man

<EOS>
attempt

make
by

Royalists
to
force
an
entrance
to
the
church

but
the
window
be
secure
by
bar
,
and
the
door
be
fashion
of
stout
oak
and
clamp
with
iron
,
their
effort
be
futile
,
and
only
excite
the
derision
of
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
a
regiment
of
cavalry
have
come
up
,
and
all
seem
over
with
the
brave
man
in
the
church
.
<EOS>
Massey
order
the
door
to
be
blow
open
;
but
ere
a
petard
could
be
fix
to
it
,
a
fresh
alarm

Massey
prepare
to

him
,
but
his

utterly
unable
to
resist
the
overwhelming
force
bring
against
them
.
<EOS>
Their
rank
be
break
on
the
first
charge
,
and
they
make
a

long
retreat
into

all
Massey

who
be
more
intent
on
secure
the
pass
he
have
gain

anxious
to
destroy
the

<EOS>
He
know
the
immense
importance
attach
by
Cromwell
to
the
possession
of
Upton
Bridge

he
also

the

its

heartily
welcome

<EOS>
almost
midway
between
this
place
and
Red

,
until
quite
recently
,
have
stand
another
fine
old
manor
-
house
,
belong
to
Sir
Robert
Berkeley
,
and
it
be
in
this
large
mansion
,
the
position
of
which
perfectly
suit
him
,
that
the
Lord
General
mean
to
fix
his
quarter
;
but
he
learn
from
his
friend
Mr.
Symonds
that
the
mansion
no
longer
exist
--
it
have
be
burn
down
only
three
day
previously
by
the
scottish
Presbyterians
,
because
Sir
Robert
Berkeley
,
its
owner
,
when
one
of
the
Justices
of
the
King
's
Bench
in
the
time
of
the
late

,
have
give
his

<EOS>
Judge
Berkeley
,
we
may
remark
,
have
be
very
hardly

for
high
treason
,
he
be
fine
twenty
thousand
pound
,
deprive
of
his
office
,
and
imprison
in
the
Tower

<EOS>
His
house
have
be
plunder
by
the
Parliamentarians
in
the
first
siege
of
Worcester
,
and
now
it
be
burn
down
by
the
soldier
of
the
sovereign
,
whose
cause
he
warmly
support
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
his
loyalty
be
unimpaired
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
this
high
-
minded
and
charitable
man
that
Worcester
owe
the
Berkeley
Hospital
.
 
<EOS>
as
Cromwell
ride
through
Spetchley
Park
,
on
his
way
to
Red
Hill
,
early
next
morning
,
he
stop
to
look
at
the
blackened
ruin
of
the
fine
old
mansion
,
with
which
he
have
be
well
acquaint
,
and
though
not
easily
move
,
he
be
touch
by
its
melancholy
aspect
.
<EOS>
a
pleasant
spot
it
have
be
,
but
it
be
now
an
utter
ruin
--
nothing
be
leave
stand
except
the
stable
.
 
<EOS>
"
these
Scots
,
"
he
remark
to
Dighton
,
an
inferior
officer
of
his
life
guard
,
who
be
in
constant
attendance
upon
him
,
"
have
do
bad
than
the
man
of
Ephraim
<EOS>
do
,
when
they
threaten
to
burn
down
Jephtha
's
house
upon
him
with
fire
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
mean
and
dastardly
revenge
,
and
they
will
pay
for
it
.
<EOS>
those
stable
be
large
,
"
he
say
,
observe
them
carefully
;
"
and
the
room
connect
with
them
must
be
commodious
.
<EOS>
I
will
pass
the
night
here
.
<EOS>
hold
thy
peace
,
Dighton
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
thou
wouldst
say
--
<EOS>
but
I
care
not
if
the
room
have
be
occupy
by
groom
.
"
 
<EOS>
Dighton
give
the
necessary
order
while
the
Lord
General
ride
slowly
along
the
noble
avenue
of
elm
-
tree
that
lead
to
the
place
where
the
old
mansion
once
stand
.
<EOS>
within
Spetchley
Park
,
which
be
charmingly
woode
,
and
contain
a
fine
sheet
of
water
,
the
main
body
of
the
Parliamentary
army
be
encamp
.
<EOS>
next
come
Lord
Grey
of
Groby

,
and
the
camp
continue
,
at
interval
,
to
Red

,
where
Lilburn
's
regiment
be
now

.
 
<EOS>
as
Cromwell
approach
Red
Hill
,
he
hear
the
sound
of
cannon
,
and
,
quicken
his
pace
,
soon
learn
that
the
gun
of
Fort
Royal
have
open
upon
Lilburn
's
troop
while
they
be
take
up
a
position
on
the
height
.
 
<EOS>
as
no
damage
be
do
,
Colonel
Lilburn
do
not
return
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
let
them
waste
their
ammunition
if
they
will
,
"
he
say
to
his
engineer
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
not
too
much
to
spare
.
"
 
<EOS>
Cromwell
be
of
the
same
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
useless
to
cannonade
them
from
these
height
,
"
he
say
to
Lilburn
.
"
<EOS>
but
I
will
soon
get
near
enough
to
reach
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
accompany
by
a
regiment
of
musketeer
and
a
train
of
artillery
,
he
then
ride
on
to
Perry
Wood
,
which
,
as
we
know
,
face
Fort
Royal
,
and
,
in
order
that
the
movement
may
not
be
discover
by
the
Royalists
,
he
shape
his
course
through
the
Nunnery
Wood
,
so
designate
because
it
have
once
belong
to
the
old
convent
we
have
allude
to
in
describe
White
Lady
Aston
,
and
enter
Perry
Wood
,
where
his
man
could
be
hide
.
<EOS>
He
then
give
order
that
during
the
night
a
strong
breastwork
should
be
raise
on
the
south
of
the
hill
,
and
a
battery
of
heavy
gun
mount
,
which
would
command
Fort
Royal
.
 
<EOS>
this
done
,
he
return
as
he
come
,
attend
only
by
a
small
escort
;
but
he
halt
for
a
short
time
at
the
Nunnery
Farm
to
see
what
the
enemy
be
about
.
<EOS>
the
engineer
on
Fort
Royal
have
not
make
any
discovery
of
the
troop
conceal
in
Perry
Wood
,
and
be
still
fire
away
uselessly
at
Lilburn
's
camp
on
Red
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
throughout
the
day
the
Lord
General
remain
with
Lilburn
,
and
together
they
reconnoitre
the
enemy
from
various
point
of
Red
Hill
,
examine
the
new
line
of
fortification
,
which
surprise
them
by
their
extent
,
and
be
much
strike
by
the
formidable
appearance
of
the
Castle
Mount
.
<EOS>
but
they
have
troop
as
well
as
fortification
to
examine
--
the
main
body
of
the
king
's
army
be
now
post
on
this
side
of
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
what
they
beheld
.
<EOS>
from
Friars'-gate
on
the
east
to
the
south-
west
angle
of
the
fortification
near
the
river
,
the
city
be
surround
by
troop
.
<EOS>
Lesley
's
brigade
have
descend
from
King
's
Hill
,
and
now
occupy
the
Blockhouse
Fields
.
<EOS>
this
scottish
cavalry
seem
to
give
Cromwell
little
uneasiness
,
and
he
smile
as
he
point
them
out
to
Lilburn
,
but
he
do
not
regard
with
equal
indifference
the
large
force
under
the
Duke
of
Hamilton
,
which
occupy
the
London-
road
,
and
command
the
approach
to
the
Sidbury
-
gate
.
<EOS>
nor
do
either
of
them
think
lightly
of
the
regiment
respectively
command
by
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
,
Lord
Wilmot
,
Colonel
Legge
,
and
Colonel
Lane
.
<EOS>
Lilburn
think
General
Middleton
's
brigade
likely
to
give
him
trouble
.
<EOS>
Middleton
's
troop
be
post
near
the
river
,
on
the
spot
where
Diglis
's
Bowling
-
green
be
subsequently
lay
out
.
 
<EOS>
such
be
the
disposition
of
the
royal
force
on
the
south
and
south-
east
side
of
Worcester
when
the
two
parliamentary
leader
examine
them
from
Red
Hill
.
<EOS>
Cromwell
look
upon
the
troop
as
already
scatter
and
consume
.
<EOS>
but
Lilburn
be
strike
by
their
gallant
appearance
,
and
do
not
refuse
them
the
tribute
of
a
soldier
's
admiration
.

a
night
ATTACK

<EOS>
the

consternation
reign
within
the
city
.
<EOS>
Massey
's
defeat
at
Upton
have
be
feel
as
a
heavy
blow
,
and
the
bold
amongst
the
Cavaliers
be
much
discourage
by
it
.
<EOS>
the
appearance
of
the
enemy
on
the
southern
height
increase
the
alarm
of
the
citizen
,
and
some
of
the
most
timorous
begin
to
think
of
flight
.
<EOS>
for
the
credit
of
the
loyal
city
,
and
its
brave
inhabitant
,
we
be
happy
to
record
that
these
be

<EOS>
a
proclamation
be
make
that
all
who
desire
to
depart
may
do
so

themselves

permission
.
<EOS>
the
excitement
cause
by
the
movement
of
the
troop
,
and
the
cannonade
from
Fort
Royal
,
soon
rouse
the
spirit
of
the

and
enable
them
to
shake
off
their
depression
.

I

"
the

it

<EOS>
"
yes

there
be
other
--
many
other

who
would

be
Middleton

Will

joyfully

<EOS>
I
will
answer
for
him

He

I

if
the

the
Duke

Colonel
Drummond

<EOS>
above

one

<EOS>
the
camisade
must
take
place
tonight
--
an
hour
after
midnight
--
when
the
rebel
be
lull
to
repose
.
<EOS>
then
Middleton
must
dash
through
Lilburn
's
camp
,
and
cut
his
way
through
all
other
obstacle
to
Spetchley
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
half
inclined

lead
the
attack

It

You
would
throw
away

<EOS>
the
chance
be
a
thousand

against
Middleton

<EOS>
but
that
matter
little
if
he
can
accomplish
his
object

<EOS>
Should
the
enterprise

the
loss
of
Upton
Bridge

I

<EOS>
"
I
will

"
 
<EOS>
and
,
bid
Massey
a
kindly
farewell
,
he
take
his
departure
.
 
<EOS>
the
king
have
intend
to
visit
the
camp
just
form
at
Wick
,
but
his
plan
be
now
change
,
he
cross
the
bridge
,
and
send
on
Careless
with
a
message
to
Middleton
,
who
be
post
outside
the
city
,
opposite
Frog
Gate
,
with
his
regiment
,
bid
the
general
attend
him
without
delay
at
the
Commandery
,
and
bring
with
him
Sir
William
Keith
and
Colonel
Legge
.
<EOS>
We
have
already
mention
that
the
Duke
of
Hamilton
be
quarter
at
the
Commandery
,
and
on
the
king
's
arrival
at
the
ancient
hospital
,
he
find
the

in
the
refectory
--
a
large

beautifully
proportion
hall
,
with
an
open
roof
of
richly
ornament
woodwork
,
minstrel
's
gallery
,
and
lofty
window

<EOS>
with

and
<EOS>
the
king
remain
in
converse
with
them
until
Careless
appear
with
General
Middleton
and
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
party
then
adjourn
to
an
inner
room
,
better
adapt
than
the
refectory
,
for
secret
discussion
,
and
Careless
be
station
at
the
door
to
prevent
all
chance
of
interruption

<EOS>
the
apartment

on
a
small
garden
,
and
the
day
be
extremely
warm
,
one
of
the
window
be
unluckily
leave
open
--
unluckily
,
we
say
,
for
a
personage
outside
,
apparently
a
gardener
,
contrive
to
place
himself
so
near
it
,
that
he
overhear
all
that
pass
within
.
<EOS>
the
conference
do
not
last
long
.
<EOS>
General
Middleton

as
Massey

foresee
,
at
once
undertake
the
dare
enterprise
,
and
both
his
companion

eager
to
share
the
danger
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
when
all
have
be
discuss
and
settle
,
General
Middleton

to
the
king
:
 
"
Your

<EOS>

in
a
surprisingly
short
space
of

a
semicircle
of
fire

<EOS>
the
spire

their
cannonade
briskly

send
shot
into

part

the
hope

several

<EOS>
"
I
be
not
so
sure
of
that
,
"
reply
Sir
Robert
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
my
word
would
have
be
take
.
<EOS>
but
be
that
as
it
may
,
I
care
not
to
answer
question
rudely
put
to
me
by
your
soldier
.
<EOS>
mistake
me
not
--
<EOS>
I
make
no
complaint
of
ill
-
treatment
.
<EOS>
such
explanation
as
I
have
to
offer
your
excellency
I
give
readily
.
<EOS>
My
habitation
have
be
burn
down
,
my
stable
occupy
,
I
have
no
place
of
refuge
except
my
summer-
house
,
where
I
seek
shelter
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
there
I
be
find
,
as
hath
just
be
state
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
only
yourself
to
thank
for
the
detention
,
Sir
Robert
,
"
rejoin
cromwell
.
"
<EOS>
though
your
nephew
,
Sir
Rowland
Berkeley
of
Cotheridge
,
be
an
avow
malignant
,
and
you
yourself
be
know
as
an
active
partisan
of
Charles
Stuart
<EOS>
,
I
will
not
discredit
what
you
tell
me
.
<EOS>
You
be
free
;
and
,
furthermore
,
be
free
to
speak
of
all
you
have
see
or
hear
.
<EOS>
You
shall
be
conduct
to
the
near
outpost
,
or
,
if
you
desire
it
,
shall
be
take
to
White
Lady
Aston
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
rather
sleep
beneath
a
tree
than
under
Mr.
Symonds
's
roof
;
"
reply
the
old
judge
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
may
ask
a
favour
of
your
excellency
it
would
be
to
be
allow
to
pass
the
night
in
my
summerhouse
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
like
the
spot
,
"
remark
Cromwell
,
somewhat
suspiciously
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
all
that
be
leave
me
of
the
old
place
,
"
reply
the
judge
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
will
consider
of
it
,
"
say
Cromwell
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
you
sup
,
Sir
Robert
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
neither
dine
nor
sup
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
fast
too
long
for
a
man
of
your
year
.
<EOS>
You
shall
sup
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
say
in
a
more
cordial
tone
than
the
Lord
General
have
hitherto
adopt
.
 
<EOS>
Dismounting
,
he
give
his
horse
to
a
soldier
,
and
order
Cornet
Hardiman
to
show
him
the
room
prepare
for
him
in
the
stable
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
with
me
,
Sir
Robert
,
"
he
add
to
the
old
judge
,
who
,
of
course
,
comply
with
a
request
amount
to
a
command
.
 
<EOS>
the
stable
be
full
of
horse
,
it
seem
at
first
that
there
could
be
but
little
accommodation
for
the
Lord
General
,
but
the
cornet
mount
up
a
ladder
-
like
flight
of
stair
,
that
bring
them
to
a
room
which
may
have
be
a
hay
-
loft
,
but
which
be
now
furnish
with
a
table
and
a
few
old
-
fashioned
chair
save
from
the
wreck
of
the
ruin
mansion
,
on
the
table
be
place
cold
viand
and
a
couple
of
flask
of
wine
.
<EOS>
cover
be
lay
for
four
,
in
case
the
Lord
General
should
invite
any
of
his
officer
to
sup
with
him
,
as
be
occasionally
his
will
not
.
<EOS>
a
lamp
set
on
the
table
scarcely
illumine
the
loft
,
but
its
glimmer
show
the
cobwebbe
rafter
overhead
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
Dighton
wait
below
,
"
say
Cromwell
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
require
no
attendance
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
the
cornet
withdraw
,
he
take
off
his
casque
and
gauntlet
,
and
pronounce
,
with
considerable
unction
,
a
very
long
grace
,
during
which
he
keep
Sir
Robert
stand
.
<EOS>
Grace
end
at
last
,
he
bid
him
sit
down
and
fall
to
--
set
him
the
example
.
<EOS>
though
the
old
judge
have
fast
so
long
,
he
eat
little
in
comparison
with
his
host
,
and
drink
only
a
single
glass
of
wine
.
<EOS>
cromwell
,
however
,
partook
with
right
good
appetite
of
the
plain
fare
set
before
him
,
and
empty
a
large
flagon
of
sack
.
<EOS>
while
thus
employ
,
he
scarcely
speak
a
word
,
but
he
afford
his
guest
an
excellent
opportunity
of
study
his
remarkable
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
with
Cromwell
's
coarse
feature
,
disfigure
by
a
large
,
ill
-
form
red
nose
,
against
which
the
Cavaliers
never
cease
to
direct
their
scurril
jest
with
his
stout
,
ungainly
figure
,
utterly
devoid
of
dignity
and
grace
,
the
reader
must
be
familiar
.
<EOS>
yet
with
all
these
drawback
,
which
have
not
be
in
the
slight
degree
exaggerate
,
the
Lord
General
's
physiognomy
be
very
striking
.
<EOS>
chiefly
so
,
on
account
of
its
determined
and
formidable
expression
.
<EOS>
His
eye
possess
extraordinary
power
,
and
few
could
brook
its
glance
when
he
be
anger
,
or
when
his
suspicion
be
arouse
.
<EOS>
His
habitual
expression
be
that
of
bluff
sternness
,
and
he
look
like
a
surly
bull
-
dog
,
whom
no
one
who
value
a
whole
skin
would
care
to
offend
,
and
yet
he
could
put
off
this
morose
and
repelling
<EOS>
look
when
he
please
,
and
exchange
it
for
one
of
rough
good
-
humour
.
<EOS>
but
even
when
he
unbend
,
he
inspire
fear
.
<EOS>
His
character
have
be
too
much
darken
by
some
writer
,
and
virtue
have
be
ascribe
to
him
by
other
which
he
certainly
do
not
possess
.
<EOS>
courageous
,
crafty
,
ambitious
,
hypocritical
,
almost
a
fatalist
,
cruel
,
unjust
,
and
unrestraine
by
any
moral
principle
,
by
the
sole
force
of
his
indomitable
will
,
he
overcome
every
obstacle
,
and
reach
the
goal
at
which
he
aim
.
<EOS>
His
ambition
be
boundless
,
nothing
less
than
sovereign
power
would
satisfy
him
,
though
he
affect
to
disdain
the
title
of
king
,
be
perfectly
aware
that
the
Royalists
would
never
accept
a
regicide
as
king
.
<EOS>
of
marvellous
sagacity
and
penetration
,
he
be
rarely
deceive
in
his
judgment
of
man
,
and
always
use
them
,
where
he
could
,
as
instrument
in
further
his
design
.
<EOS>
a
profound
dissembler
,
and
fully
capable
of
use
religion
as
a
mask
,
have
it
be
needful
to
do
so
<EOS>
,
it
can
scarcely
be
doubt
that
he
be
really
religious
;
though
few
entirely
believe
in
the
sincerity
of
his
religious
profession
.
<EOS>
Cromwell
's
character
be
full
of
striking
contrast
.
<EOS>
abhor
by
his
enemy
,
he
have
multitude
of
devoted
friend
.
<EOS>
for
a
time
his
memory
be
execrate
.
<EOS>
in
latter
day
somewhat
more
than
justice
have
be
do
him
.
<EOS>
the
great
crime
he
commit
have
never
be
pardon
--
will
never
be
pardon
.
<EOS>
the
stain
of
blood
can
not
be
wash
out
.
<EOS>
as
to
his
high
military
genius
all
be
agree
.
<EOS>
among
great
commander
he
stand
foremost
.
<EOS>
and
he
would
rank
among
the
great
of
man
,
if
his
crime
do
not
overshadow
his
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
the
accoutrement
of
the
Lord
General
differ
very
little
from
those
of
an
officer
of
his
own
bodyguard
,
except
that
they
be
somewhat
more
ornamented
,
be
filigraine
with
gold
.
<EOS>
They
consist
of
an
open
casque
and
a
very
large
gorget
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
neither
breast
-
plate
,
nor
cuisse
--
the
stout
buff
coat
with
long
skirt
which
he
wear
afford
sufficient
protection
to
the
low
part
of
his
person
.
<EOS>
a
scarf
be
tie
round
his
waist
.
<EOS>
His
strong
buff
boot
be
draw
far
up
the
thigh
,
and
from
his
broad
embroider
shoulder
-
belt
hang
a
large
basket
-
hilte
sword
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
unconscious
that
he
be
the
object
of
his
guest
's
covert
scrutiny
,
but
the
circumstance
do
not
trouble
him
--
perhaps
rather
gratify
him
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
he
design
to
win
over
the
old
Royalist
judge
,
or
at
least
to
produce
a
favourable
impression
upon
him
,
for
as
soon
as
he
have
finish
supper
,
he
almost
compel
Sir
Robert
to
take
more
wine
,
and
then
begin
a
very
friendly
discourse
with
him
,
profess
great
regret
that
Spetchley
manor
-
house
have
be
destroy
by
the
scottish
soldier
,
and
express
a
hope
that
it
may
soon
be
rebuild
.
 
<EOS>
Their
conversation
,
however
,
be
interrupt
by
the
entrance
of
Dighton
,
who
inform
the
Lord
General
that
a
man
be
without
who
state
that
he
have
matter
of
the
utmost
importance
to
communicate
to
his
excellency
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
manner
of
man
be
he
?
"
demand
Cromwell
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
reason
to
believe
he
be
a
spy
from
the
city
,
"
reply
Dighton
.
"
<EOS>
He
deliver
himself
up
to
the
vedette
on
Red
Hill
,
conjure
them
to
bring
him
speedily
before
your
excellency
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
he
hath
be
send
on
from
the
first
outpost
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
bearer
of
this
letter
,
which
he
affirm
be
from
Colonel
James
,
somewhile
commandant
of
the
garrison
of
Worcester
.
"
 
<EOS>
Cromwell
take
the
missive
,
and
after
glance
at
its
content
,
say
,
"
the
man
hath
speak
truly
.
<EOS>
His
business
be
important
.
<EOS>
I
will
see
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
with
your
excellency
's
permission
I
will
retire
,
"
say
the
old
judge
,
rise
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
to
lose
your
company
,
"
say
Cromwell
;
"
but
this
be
a
matter
that
can
not
be
postpone
.
<EOS>
a
bed
must
be
find
for
Sir
Robert
Berkeley
,
"
he
add
to
Dighton
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
where
to
find
one
,
unless
his
worship
be
content
to
sleep
on
straw

the
half
-
grumble
response
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
I
be
allow
to
occupy
my
old
summerhouse
,
I
shall
be
perfectly
satisfied
,
"
reply
the
judge
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
it
so
,
Sir
Robert
,
"

Cromwell
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
sounder
repose
than
I
myself
be
likely
to
enjoy

<EOS>
to

morrow
's

surprise
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
old
judge
do
not
venture
to
question
him
,
but
,
bow
deeply
,
depart
with
Dighton
,
and
Cromwell
be
leave
for
a
few
moment
alone
.

Colonel
James

be
the
happy

import

in
whom
can
I

not
in
those

<EOS>
if
there

on
the
staircase

the
next
moment
a
tall
,
thin
man

that
of
a
Puritan
,
while
his
habiliment
be
those
of
a
Cavalier

the
Lord
General

guard

no

<EOS>
good

the

"
Kerioth

have
I
not

mentally
ejaculated
Cromwell
,
as
he
ride
up
to
the
commander
's
tent
.
 
<EOS>
Lilburn
have
throw
himself
on
a
couch
,
but
hear
Cromwell
's
approach
he
spring
to
his
foot
,
and
meet
him
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
brief
consultation
between
the
general
,
it
be
decide
that
neither
drum
should
be
beat
nor
trumpet
blow
,
lest
the
sound
should
be
hear
by
the
enemy
,
but
that
the
slumber
soldier
should
be
quietly
rouse
to
arm
;
and
this
be
do
by
Lilburn
in
person
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
Colonel
Lindsey
have
arrive
with
the
life
guard
from
Spetchley
,
and
put
himself
at
their
head
,
Cromwell
ride
to
the
outpost
near
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
this
outpost
be
about
three
hundred
yard
from
the
camp
,
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
,
not
far
from
the
London
road
,
and
be
station
in
a
field
border
on
the
north
and
north
-
east
by
high
-
banked
hedge
.
 
<EOS>
the
night
can
scarcely
be
describe
as
dark
,
though
the
sky
be
cover
with
lazily
-
move
cloud
,
but
through
these
the
moon
burst
occasionally
.
<EOS>
the
old
city
,
with
its
tower
,
steeple
,
and
fortification
,
could
be
distinguish
through
the
gloom
;
but
no
light
be
visible
within
it
,
and
no
sound
from
it
arise
.
<EOS>
so
profound
be
the
stillness
,
that
it
may
have
be
suppose
that
the
inhabitant
and
their
defender
be
alike
bury
in
slumber
,
and
that
no
attack
party
could
be
wait
to
sally
forth
.
 
<EOS>
as
Cromwell
,
with
the
life
guard
,
cautiously
descend
the
hill
,
keep
under
cover
of
the
hedge
,
three
-
quarter
past
midnight
be
strike
by
the
cathedral
clock
--
proclaim
that
the
hour
be
close
at

<EOS>
the
outpost
reach
by
Cromwell
be
guard
by
two
hundred
and
fifty
foot
and
two
hundred
horse
,
but
three
hundred
of
the
good
trooper
in
his
army
be
now
add
,
he
deem
this
force
quite
sufficient
to
repel
the
attack
.
 
<EOS>
little
time
be
leave
,
but
luckily
those
on
guard
at
the
outpost
be
on
the
alert
.
<EOS>
have
place
his
troop
with
the
quickness
and
skill
peculiar
to
him
,
the
Lord
General
station
himself
on
a
small
woody
mound
in
the
centre
of
the
field
,
whence
he
command
the
approach
to
the
Sidbury
-
gate
,
and
await
the
sortie
with
some
impatience
,
but
without
the
slight
anxiety
.
<EOS>
close
behind
him
be
Dighton
and
a
couple
of
cuirassier
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
to
wait
long
.
<EOS>
while
the
single
stroke
of
the
cathedral
bell
yet
vibrate
through
the
air
,
and
be
echo
by
the
clock
of
the
other
church
,
the
gate
yawn
wide
,
and
a
troop
of
sheeted
spectre
--
for
such
they
seem
in
the
gloom
--
issue
forth
.
<EOS>
the
ghostly
band
form
three
regiment
--
the
first

by
General
Middleton
,
the
second
by
Sir
William
Keith
,
the
third
by
Colonel
Legge

<EOS>
the
troop
come
forth
from
the
Sidbury
-
gate
and
form
in
silence
.
<EOS>
if
any
order
be
give
they
do
not
reach
Cromwell
's
ear
,
though
he
be
listen
intently
;
and
the
ghostly
appearance
of
the
horseman
be
fully
preserve
until
Middleton
dash
off
with
the
great
rapidity
,
when
the
clatter
of
hoofs
and
the
jingling
of
arm
prove
that
the
phantom
be
substantial
soldier
.
<EOS>
the
second
regiment
follow
instantly
,
gallop
along
the
London
road
as
swiftly
as
the
first
;
but
a
momentary
interval
occur
before
Colonel
Legge
start
.
<EOS>
the
cause
of
this
brief
delay
be
perfectly
intelligible
to
Cromwell
,
and
he
give
some
order
to
Dighton
,
who
ride
off
at
once
to
Colonel
Lindsey
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
two
foremost
regiment
come
on
at
full
speed
,
and
dash
past
the
field
in
which
the
outpost
be
station
,
make
it
evident
that
their
point
of
attack
be
Lilburn
's
camp
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
,
and
show
that
the
outpost
would
be
deal
with
by
the
regiment
that
follow

<EOS>
in
obedience
to
Cromwell
's
order
not
a

have
be

,
and
Colonel
Legge
come
on
uncertain
as
to
how
he
would
be
receive
by
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
easy
access
to
the
field
could
be
obtain
at
several
point
know
to
the
Royalists
,
and
small
party
of
man
enter
at
these
place
,
but
the
main
body
,
lead
by
Colonel
Legge
,
break
through
the

be
receive
by

<EOS>
on

right
and
leave

who
pour
a
terrible
volley
upon
the

as
they
gain
the

<EOS>
several

<EOS>
nevertheless
,
Colonel
Legge
,
shout
to
his
man
to
follow
,
charge
the
pikeman
with
the
great
intrepidity
,
but
it
be
impossible
to
cut
through
their
rank
.
<EOS>
many
horse
be
kill
in
the
charge
,
and
other
so
desperately
hurt
that
they
bear
back
their
rider
in

force
them
on

<EOS>
Colonel
Legge
's
charger
,
though
badly
hurt

have
still
strength
enough
leave
to
sustain
its
rider
,
but
would
not
again
face
the
deadly
pike
.
 
<EOS>
catch
as
in
a
trap
,
it
seem
as
if
the
unfortunate
Royalists
must
all
be
slaughter
,
but
turn
from
the
pikeman
,
Colonel
Legge
charge
the
musketeer
with
a
fury
that
prove
irresistible
.
<EOS>
have
gain
the
open
field
,
with
such
of
his

him
,
he

but
before
they

they

Colonel
Lindsey

at
the
head
of
the

guard
,
and
so
shatter

that
they

flee
from

in
the
great
disorder

hurry
towards
the

faster
than
they

quit
it

<EOS>
Colonel

be
the

retreat
.
<EOS>
His
horse
carry
him
out
of
reach
of
the
foe
,
and
then
drop
.
 
<EOS>
Cromwell
watch
the
conflict
from
the
mound
on
which
he
have
take
his
stand
,
and
do
not
quit
his
position
during
the
short
time

"
It

he
exclaim
,
as
the
Royalists
flee
in
disorder
.
"
<EOS>
pursue
them
not
,
but
prepare
to
cut
off
the
retreat
of
those
pestilent
malignant
who
have
go
on
to
attack
the

above--
lest
,
peradventure

they
escape
the
snare
lay
for

"
 
<EOS>
It
happen
as
Cromwell
have
foresee
.
<EOS>
instead
of
find
Lilburn
unprepared
,
when
General
Middleton
and
Sir
William
Keith
reach
the
camp
on
the
hill
,
they
quickly
discover
that
their
design
have
be
betray

<EOS>
dupe
by
stratagem
which
they
ought
to
have
suspect
,
they
enter
the
camp
,
but
have
scarcely
do
so
,
when
they
be
completely
surround
by
a
force
more
than
treble
their
own
.
 
<EOS>
thus
entrap
it
would
seem
that
nothing
be
leave
to
Middleton
but
to
surrender
.
<EOS>
but
the
brave
general
be
undismaye
by
number
,
and
when
summon
to
surrender
,
answer
by
a
charge
so
fierce
and
impetuous
that
the
rank
of
the
enemy
open
,
and
,
ere
they
could
close
again
,
he
and
his
two
regiment
have
pass
safely
through
.
 
<EOS>
down
the
hill
they
dash
at
a
headlong
pace
,
and
,
though
hotly
pursue
by
Lilburn
,
very
few
of
them
be

<EOS>
luckily
for
the
fugitive

Cromwell
be
not
able

get
his

guard
out

in
time
to

their
utter
destruction
would
have
be
inevitable

<EOS>
as
it
be

they
escape

<EOS>
in
the
principal
room
of
the
old
hostel
he
find
,
as
he
expect
,
a
party
of
Cavaliers
smoking
,
singing
,
and
quaff
sack
and
claret
,
as
if
they
have
no
serious
business
in
hand
.
<EOS>
They
be
thus
make
merry
to
the
last
,
since
among
them
be
Major
Knox
and
some
other
,
who
,
two
hour
later
,
be
kill
in
the
attack
on
the
outpost
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
fully
armed
with
steel
cap
,
gorget
,
cuirass
,
pauldron
,
and
tach
,
but
have
divest
themselves
of
their
sword
and
pistol
.
<EOS>
beside
each
sword
lie
a
small
roll
of
linen
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
shirt
which
its
owner
mean
to
wear
over
his
armour
,
and
which
,
in
some
case
,
prove
a
winding
-
sheet
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
Cavaliers
rise
on
Careless
's
appearance
,
and
give
him
a
hearty
welcome
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
help
be
strike
by
the
enthusiasm
they
display
.
<EOS>
not
one
of
them
but
seem
proud
of
be
include
in
the
dangerous
enterprise
.
<EOS>
not
one
but
be
ready
to
lay
down
his
life
for
the
king
.
<EOS>
Careless
never
afterwards
recall
that
meeting
without
heave
a
sigh
for
the
brave
man
who
perish
in
the
camisade
.
<EOS>
however
,
at
the
moment
,
he
think
little
of
the
hazard
of
the
attack
,
and
would
gladly
have
join
in
it
if
the
king
would
have
allow
him
.
<EOS>
sit
down
,
he
empty
the
flagon
of
claret
fill
for
him
by
Major
Knox
.
<EOS>
shortly
afterwards
Colonel

the
room
,
but
leave
again
almost
immediately
,
say
,
as
he
depart
,
to
Major
Knox
:
 
<EOS>
"
half
an
hour
hence
you
must
all
be
at
the
place
of
rendezvous
.
"
 
<EOS>
shortly
afterwards
Careless
take
leave
of
the
company
,
and
be
proceed
along
Friars'-street
in
the
direction
of
the
Sidbury

gate
,
when
he
hear
his
name
pronounce
in
a
familiar
voice
,
that
instantly
awaken
tender
recollection
,
and
turn
<EOS>

he
perceive
that
he
have
be
follow
from
the
hostel
by
a
young
woman
whose
feature
be
muffle
in
a
hood
.
 
<EOS>
not
doubt
who
it
be
,
he
exclaim
:
 
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
be
it
you
,
Mary
?
<EOS>
I
never
expect
to
see
you
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
you
would
not
see
me
now
<EOS>
,
I
can
assure
you
,
if
I
have
not
something
of
importance
to
say
,
"
she
rejoin
,
partially
remove
her
hood
.
 
<EOS>
"
whatever
have
procure
me
the
happiness
of
behold
you
once
more
<EOS>
,
sweet
Mary
,
I
feel
grateful
for
it
,
"
he
rejoin
.
 
<EOS>
"
speak
not
thus
lightly
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
a
grave
matter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
before
you
mention
it
,
then
,
let
me
ask
how
you
come
to
throw
yourself
away
upon
that
detestable
Roundhead
?
<EOS>
You
must
be
heartily
sick
of
him
already
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
persist
in
talk
thus
you
will
frighten
me
away
,
and
I
shall
leave
unsaid
what
I
have
to
tell
you
--
and
it
be
very
important
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
by
all
that
be
bewitch
,
I
swear
you
shall
not

"
he
cry
,
catch
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
serious
,
if
you
can
,
for
a

me

"
 
<EOS>
"
tell
me
you

to
abandon
Urso

and
I
will
be
as
serious
as
you

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
put
everything
out
of
my
head
by
your
trifling
talk
.
<EOS>
how
very
different
you
be
from
Urso
,
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
He
be
always
grave
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
warrant
me
you
rarely
catch
a
smile
on
his
sour
visage
.
<EOS>
but
I
hope
there
be
few
point
of
resemblance
between
him
and
me
.
<EOS>
again
I
ask
,
how
could
you
marry
such
a
man
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
Twas
all
my

she

<EOS>
"
and
you
have
bitterly

I
will

<EOS>
Confess
,
and
I
will
forgive
you
,
though
,
I
own
,
the
effort
will
be
difficult

"
 
<EOS>
"
then
pray
do
not
make
it
.
<EOS>
unless
you
listen
to
my
warning
,
you
will
fall
into
a
snare
that
have
be
privily
lay
for
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Privily
lay
for
me
by
Urso
,
eh
?
<EOS>
the
round
-
head
rogue
have
well
take
care
of
himself

or
you
will
speedily
become
a
widow

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
not

"
 
<EOS>
all
his
levity
have
vanish
.
<EOS>
as
she
do
not

,
he
repeat
the
question
still
more
peremptorily
.
 
<EOS>
"
no

she
rejoin

we
must
not

thus

<EOS>
You
speak
of
a
snare

privily
lay
for
me

<EOS>
what
be
your
meaning
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
nothing
more
,
"
she
rejoin
.
 
<EOS>
and
break
from
him
,
she
fly
towards
the
inn
.
 
<EOS>
just
as
she
reach
the
door
the
Cavaliers
come
forth
in
a
body
.
<EOS>
some
of
them
try
to
stop
her
,
but
she
push
them
aside
and
get
into
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
careless
think
of
follow
her
and
insist
on
an
explanation
,
but
after
a
moment
's
reflection
he
conclude
that
,
since
she
be
lodge
at
the
inn
,
she
must
have
overhear
the
loud
and
indiscreet
talk
of
the
Cavaliers
,
and
so
have
ascertain
the
nature
of
the
enterprise
on
which
they
be
engage
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
"
privily
-
lay
snare
"
of
which
he
have
be
warn
,
the
expression
savour
strongly
of
Urso
,
and
probably
mean
nothing
in
particular
.
 
<EOS>
have
arrive
at
this
conclusion
he
march
off
,
with
the
fix
determination
of
pay
another
visit
to
the
old
hostel
on
the
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
but
before
the
morrow
come
he
be
undeceived
,
and
he
then
bitterly
regret
that
he
have
neglect
the
warning
give
him
.
 
<EOS>
so
well
be
the
secret
keep
,
that
only
the
troop
actually
engage
in
the
camisade
<EOS>
be
aware
of
its
object
.
<EOS>
many
hear
of
the
enterprise
and
of
its
failure
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
when
the
attack
party
be
drive
back
,
a
call
to
arm
be
instantly
make
by
the
Duke
of
Hamilton
and
all
the
commander
station
on
the
south
and
south
-
east
,
l
Cromwell
should
follow
up
his
success
by
an
immediate
assault
on
the
city
.
<EOS>
but
it
soon
become
apparent
that
he
have
no
such
design
,
and
though
the
Royalists
remain
on
the
alert
,
they
be
not
disturb
during
the
remainder
of
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
to
Charles
,
who
have
make
certain
of
success
,
the
failure
of
the
enterprise
be
a
terrible
disappointment
.
<EOS>
but
he
bear
it
manfully
,
as
he
bear
all
his
reverse
.
<EOS>
He
have
remain
at
the
Commandery
in
order
that
he
may
receive
the
early
intelligence
of
the
victory
he
so
confidently
anticipate
,
and
be
seat
in
the
refectory
,
try
to
while
away
the
time
in
light
chat
with
Careless
,
when
General
Middleton
,
follow
by
Sir
William
Keith
and
Colonel
Legge
enter
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Charles
read
what
have
happen
in
their
downcast
look
,
and
for
a
moment
forbore
to
question
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fortune
have
play
me
another
sorry
trick
,
I
perceive
,
"
he
exclaim
,
at
length
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
the
fickle
goddess
would
this
time
have
befriend
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
all
would
have
go
well
,
sire
,
if
our
plan
have
not
be
betray
,
"
reply
Middleton
.
<EOS>
"
the
enemy
be
prepare
.
<EOS>
We
find
the
whole
of
Colonel
Lilburn
's
force
under
arm
,
and
be
surround
,
but
succeed
in
cut
our
way
through
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
further
proof
of
treachery
,
sire
,
"
say
Colonel
Legge
.
<EOS>
"
cromwell
himself
,
with
his
body
-
guard
of
Ironsides
,
be
with
the
outpost
when
I
attack
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Charles
could
not
repress
an
exclamation
of
rage
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
we
have
be
buy
and
sell
<EOS>
be
certain
,
"
he
exclaim
.
"
<EOS>
but
who
can
have
betray
us
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
can
give
a
shrewd
guess
as
to
the
villain
who
have
thus
traitorously
discover
the
design
,
"
say
Careless
,
"
and
<EOS>
if
I
be
right
he
shall
not
escape
chastisement
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
whoever
the
traitor
may
be
,
"
observe
the
king
,
"
he
must
have
obtain
early
information
,
and
have
act
with
the
great
promptitude
,
or
the
enemy
could
not
have
be
prepare
at
all
point
for
the
attack
.
<EOS>
Cromwell
must
have
clever
and
active
spy
in
the
city
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
true
,
sire
,
"
reply
Middleton
.
<EOS>
"
and
I
now
recollect
that
,
during
our
conference
in
the
adjoining
chamber
,
a
man
in
the
garden
approach
somewhat
near
to
the
open
window
.
<EOS>
at
the
time
I
do
not
suspect
his
motive
,
but
I
now
believe
he
be
a
spy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
so
,
"
observe
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
"
whether
General
Middleton
be
right
or
wrong
in
his
suspicion
,
I
be
certain
I
can
discover
the
traitor
,
sire
,
"
say
Careless
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
clue
to
his
hiding
-
place
,
and
before
many
hour
I
engage
to
produce
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
some
satisfaction
to
hang
the
villain
,
"
observe
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
majesty
may
rely
upon
have
that
gratification
,
"
reply
careless
.
<EOS>
"
with
your
permission
,
I
will
set
about
his
capture
at
once

<EOS>
nor
will
I
rest
till
I
have
effect
it

"
 
<EOS>
and
bow
to
the

of
the
Commandery

<EOS>
take
two
of
the
man
with
him
,
Careless
proceed
to
the
Sidbury-
gate
,
pass
through
the
wicket
with
his
attendant
,
and
in
another
minute
be
in
Friars'-street
.
 
<EOS>
so
dark
be
the
narrow
street
,
owe
to
the
project
story
of
the
ancient
timber
house
line
it
on
either
side
,
that
Careless
be
unable
to
discern
any
object
unless
close
at
hand

<EOS>
a
heavy
,
measured
tread
,
however
,
inform
him
of
the
approach
of
the
round
,
and
the
next
moment
the
patrol
come
up

<EOS>
Captain

who
be
with
the
guard

immediately
recognise
his
superior
officer

and
on
learn
Careless

business

proffer
his
aid
.
<EOS>
They
proceed
together
to
the
old
inn
,
follow
by
the
whole
party
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
seem
that
all
the
inmate
have
retire
to
rest
,
but
the
knocking
of
a
halbert
staff
against
the
door
soon
cause
it
to
be
open
by
Master
Kilvert
,
the
host
,
who
have
hastily
huddle
on
his
apparel

and
in
a
tremble
voice
inquire
the
meaning

nocturnal
visitation

order
the
guard
to

themselves
secretly
on
the
other
side
of

be
ready
to
answer
any
summon

Careless
and
Captain
Woolfe
enter
the

shut
the
street
door
after
them

the
terrified

down
the
light
with

<EOS>
what
charles

from
the
summit
of
the
cathedral
TOWER
 
<EOS>
brightly
dawn
the
fatal
3rd
of
September
,
1651
,
as
if
the
day
just
break
be
destine
to
be
one
of
peace
and
rejoice
rather
than
of
strife
and
bloodshed
.
<EOS>
but
the
gladdening
influence
of
the
sunshine
that
gild
its
tower
,
spire
,
and
pinnacle
could
not
dispel
the
gloom
hang
over
the
devoted

<EOS>
man

restless
couch
oppress
with
the
sense
that
the
dreadful
contest
in
which
they
must
of
necessity
take
part
be
close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
before
night
the
king
's
fate
would
probably
be
decide
.
<EOS>
if
he
fall
,
the
city
dedicate
to
his
cause
would
fall
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
this
conviction
force
itself
upon
the
mind
of
all
who
arise
that
morn
in
Worcester
.
<EOS>
after
arm
themselves
,
many
of
the
soldier
citizen
look
round
at
their
quiet
home
as

or
gaze
with
unspeakable
anguish
at
their

well

if
the
ruthless

<EOS>
some
few
be
unmanned

but
the
majority
face
the
terrible
situation
resolutely
,
and
conquer
their
emotion
.
<EOS>
of
victory
they
have
now
but
little
hope
,
yet
they
do

since
in

always
a
chance

<EOS>
Their
word

<EOS>
if

not
secure
him
the
throne
they
could
die
for
him

their
life
dearly

<EOS>
as
to
surrender
,
such
a
thought
never

if
advantageous
term

they
would
have

proposal

and
be
well
pleased
to
see
them

but
be
impatient

he
scarcely
pause
a
moment
,
and
quickly
ascend
a
second
circular
staircase
,
narrower
and
steep
than
the
first

and
soon
gain
the
summit
of
the
tower

<EOS>
a
wide
and
beautiful
prospect
now
lie
before

,
but
it
be
not
the

or

the

have
attain

<EOS>
but
before
proceed
with
our
description
,
let
us
say
a
word
about
the
cathedral
tower
,
on
the
summit
of
which
the
king
stand
.
 
<EOS>
some
five
century
old
,
be
finish
in
1374
<EOS>
,
this
structure
,
one
of
the
fine
in
the
kingdom
,
and
the
rich
in
embellishment
,
be
upwards
of
one
hundred
and
sixty
foot
high
,
measure
from
the
roof
of
the
central
transept
from
which
it
spring
.
<EOS>
Exquisite
tabernacle
work
surround
the
upper
stage
,
and
the
eastern
façade
be
ornament
by
figure
,
one
of
which
represent
Edward
III
.
,
at
the
latter
end
of
whose
reign
the
tower
be
complete
.
<EOS>
view
from
all
point
,
owe
to
the
position
of
the
reverend
pile
<EOS>
it
adorn
,
the
tower
appear
to
singular
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
about
fifty
year
subsequent
to
the
date
of
our
history
,
this
noble
structure
be
repair
--
judiciously
repair
,
we
be
bind
to
add
--
and
the
exist
pinnacle
and
battlement
be
erect
.
 
<EOS>
in
other
respect
it
be
unaltered
since
Charles
II
's
time
,
except
what
have
be
do
internally
in
the
belfry
and
clock
-
chamber
by
the
unwearied
exertion
of
the
Rev.
Richard
Cattley
,
one
of
the
present
minor
canon
of
the
cathedral.[3
]
<EOS>
as
the
battlement
at
the
time
of
our
history
be
more
than
six
foot
high
,
a
wooden
platform
have
be
construct
to
enable
the
king
and
his
attendant
to
look
over
them
without
inconvenience
.
<EOS>
above
the
tower
,
on
a
tall
flag
-
staff
,
float
the
royal
standard
.
 
<EOS>
spring
up
the
wooden
step
Charles
lean
over
the
south
parapet
,
and
gaze
eagerly
at
the
post
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
in
another
minute
the
whole
of
the
battlement
be
throng
,
and
a
dozen
field
-
glass
anxiously
direct
towards
Perry
Wood
and
Red
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
the
main
body
of
the
Parliamentary
army
which
now
occupy
the
former
post
remain
stationary
,
but
it
be
evident
that
some
movement
be
take
place
on
the
western
slope
of
Red
Hill
--
probably
in
the
direction
of
the
severn
--
and
think
this
may
be
so
,
Charles
direct
his
scrutiny
to
the
near
bank
of
the
river
,
but
though
he
scan
it
carefully
for
a
couple
of
mile
he
could
discern
nothing
to
justify
alarm
.
<EOS>
the
river
that
flow
past
the
lofty
pile
on
which
he
stand
be
nowhere
disturb
.
<EOS>
next
follow
the
Teme
from
its
point
of
junction
with
the
large
river
--
its
course
be
easily
trace
by
the
withe
and
willow
fringe
its
bank
--
his
eye
rest
on
the
old
bridge
of
Powick
.
<EOS>
a
desperate
effort
he
have
always
feel
,
would
be
make
by
the
enemy
,
early
in
the
day
,
to
secure
this
pass
;
but
he
do
not
foresee
,
nor
do
any
of
his
general
foresee
,
the
skilful
manuvre
by
which
its
capture
would
be
effect
.
 
<EOS>
Charles
have
every
reliance
on
General
Montgomery
's
vigilance
and
bravery
,
support
as
he
be
by
Colonel
George
Keith
.
 
<EOS>
view
from
the
cathedral
tower
on
that
bright
morning
,
Powick
seem
close
at
hand
,
and
though
the
old
bridge
be
partially
veil
in
a
slight
mist
arise
from
the
river
,
Montgomery
's
brigade
could
be
see
draw
up
on
Wykefield
,
a
large
meadow
,
close
beside
it
--
the
helmet
and
accoutrement
of
the
man
flash
in
the
sunbeam
.
 
<EOS>
satisfied
that
Montgomery
be
on
the
alert
,
and
that
no
immediate
danger
threaten
him
,
Charles
continue
his
inspection
,
and
,
with
his
field
-
glass
,
sweep
the
district
lie
between
Powick
and
Upton

<EOS>
suddenly
an
exclamation
break
from
him
that
cause
all
the
other
glass
to
be
turn
in
the
same
direction
as
his
own
,
and
it
be
then
perceive
by
all
that
a
large
body
of
cavalry
be
skirt
the
Old
Hills

<EOS>
almost
immediately
afterwards
another

as

the
hill

towards
the

and
there

more
rough

<EOS>
after
pass
the

Bunn

the
appearance
of
Bunn

be
somewhat
wild
when
Charles
gaze
at
it
from

it
be
at
the

its

feature

<EOS>
while

They
have
with

select
a
favourable
spot

<EOS>
the

who
have
notice
that
Fleetwood

the

before
them

draw
near

Their

the

the
attempt
of
the

to
cross
the

at
this

by

<EOS>
such
be
the

's
opinion
--
such
the
opinion
of
the
Earl
of
Derby--
but
in
reality
,
before

could

the

<EOS>
how
CROMWELL
threw
<EOS>
a
<EOS>
flying
bridge
<EOS>
over
<EOS>
the
teme
 
<EOS>
the
first
person
to
cross
over
be
no
other
than
Cromwell
himself
.
<EOS>
under
the
Lord
General
's
personal
superintendence
the
pontoon
bridge
have
be
construct
with
the
utmost
rapidity
,
and
,
strange
to
say
,
almost
without
opposition
.
<EOS>
He
cross
the
river
on
foot
,
at
the
head
of
the
column
of
man
we
have
describe
,
and
at
once
prepare
for
action
,
for
he
see
Pitscottie
advance
with
his
regiment
of
highlander
to
attack
him
.
<EOS>
with
the
promptitude
which
he
ever
display
,
the
Lord
General
take
up
an
excellent
position
,
and
after
a
sharp
conflict
,
during
which
he
be
reinforce
by
a

,
he
drive
back
the
high

lander
with
great
slaughter
.
 
<EOS>
Pitscottie
retreat
towards
Pitmarston
,
and
satisfied
with
route
him
,
Cromwell
march
towards
the
Teme
,
his
object
be
to
throw
a
flying
bridge
across
that
river
,
so
as
to
allow
reinforcement
to
be
send
to
Fleetwood
and
Ingoldsby
during
their
attack
upon
Montgomery
at
Powick
.
 
<EOS>
when
this
important
manuvre
be
accomplish
,
he
feel
he
should
be
master
on
the
west
side
of
the
river
,
since
a
quick
and
uninterrupted
communication
could
be
keep
up
with
his
general
.
<EOS>
His
progress
,
however
,
towards
the
Teme
be
not
unopposed
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
be
seriously
obstruct
by
the
Royalist
infantry
.
<EOS>
He
have
to
pass
through
a
meadow
,
the
hedge
of
which
be
line
with
soldier
,
who
fire
on
his
man
as
they
march
on
.
<EOS>
but
these
obstacle
be
remove
by
the
trooper
,
and
the
Teme
be
reach
,
a
fly
bridge
across
it
be
speedily
construct
.
<EOS>
thus
Cromwell
's
able
plan
be
accomplish
,
and
he
inwardly
exult
at
its
success
.
 
<EOS>
without
a
moment
's
loss
of
time
he
send
Dighton
,
with
a
detachment
,
to
Fleetwood
,
to
acquaint
that
general
with
what
have
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
"
say
to
him

"
he
add
,
"
that
the
enemy
be
now
compass
about
,
and
bid
him
destroy
them
in
the
Lord

name

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
though
he
have
no
fear
that
the
fly
bridge
across
the
Teme
could
be
reach
by
the
enemy
,
he
leave
a
sufficient
guard
for
its
protection
,
and
then
return
with
the
rest
of
his
troop
to
the
bridge
of
boat
across
the
severn
.
 
<EOS>
the
communication
between
the
two
bridge
be
now
unobstructed
,
the
enemy
have
be
completely
drive
off
.
<EOS>
cromwell
,
however
,
post
a
battalion
on
the
west
bank
of
the
Severn
to
defend
this
important
pass
.
 
<EOS>
before
cross
the
river
,
he
await
Dighton
's
return
.
<EOS>
this
active
messenger
bring
him
very
satisfactory

<EOS>
Fleetwood
and
Ingoldsby
have
reach
the
village
of

and
be
prepare
to

Montgomery
's

they

the

at

<EOS>
the
bridge
be
strongly
build
,
and
narrow
,
with
angular
opening
like
those
of
Upton
Bridge
.
 
<EOS>
Peaceful
as
be
the
spot
,
it
have
already
be
the
scene
of
a
bloody
conflict
between
the
Parliamentarians
and
Royalists
,
in
1642
,
when
Prince
Rupert
post
himself
near
a
hawthorn

bush
on
the

adjoin
Wykefield

thing
be

in

Montgomery

in

five

attack

they
sustain

kill
number
of

on
the
second

their

they
be
drive

great
slaughter

many

<EOS>
deeply

the

at

just

nine
year

that
the

as

Montgomery

when
the

a
fierce

be
make
on

so
energetic
be
it
that
the

be
drive

it
seem
as
if
possession

the
bridge
would
be
regain

the

fleeting

just

we

previously
mention

be

<EOS>
the
mill

with
its
large
wheel
form
a
picturesque
object
from

be
occupy

<EOS>
these

be

be
thus
advantageously
post

do
great
execution
upon

<EOS>
order
be
give

this
be
find

<EOS>
nor
would
they
have
be
drive
out
if

<EOS>
the
old
structure
be
speedily
in
flame

and
for
a
short
time
form
a
striking
object
in
the
terrible
picture

<EOS>
the
blaze
mill
and
some
wooden
outbuilding

which
have
likewise
catch
fire
,
be
reflect

the

the

<EOS>
with
the
fire
at

back

and
the
enemy
in
front
,
no
wonder
the
Royalists
fight
fiercely
.
<EOS>
some
few
escape
--
but
the
great
number
be
kill
,
or
throw
back
into
the
flame
.
<EOS>
Captain
Woolfe
and
Vosper
fight
their
way
out

but
poor
Trubshaw
be
not
so
fortunate
.
<EOS>
His

he
stagger

many
marvellous

fearful
odd

but
still

their

<EOS>
with

brave
regiment
of
Highlanders
,
Pitscottie
have
join
the
fight

and
lend
what
aid
he
could

<EOS>
but
despite
their
gallant
effort
to
maintain
their
ground
,
the
Cavaliers
be
drive
back
almost
as
far
as
Rupert
's
hawthorn
-
bush
.
<EOS>
still
,
the
fight
go
on
,
though
the
rank
of
the
Royalists
be
much
thin
,
and
their
ammunition
begin
to
fail
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
the
Parliamentarians
be
be
constantly
reinforce

<EOS>
consider
the
inequality

--
the
Parliamentarians
be
now
three

the
duration
of
the
fight
at
Powick
be
remarkable

<EOS>
the
contest
last
for
nearly
two
hour

and
during
this
time
the
Royalists
hold
their
ground
stoutly
against

<EOS>
Montgomery
be
severely
wound

could
with
difficulty
sit
his

into

thick
of

in

have
be

<EOS>
find
all
against
him
,
Montgomery
,
at
last
,
be
compel
to
order
a
retreat
,
and
strove
to
prevent
it
from
be
convert
into
a
total
rout

<EOS>
the
advance
of
the
victor
be
somewhat
check
by
the
soldier
,
who
line
the
hedge
,
and
fire
at
the
enemy
from
every
sheltered
spot
.
 
<EOS>
a
stand
be
make
at
Pitmarston
,
but
it
be
brief
and
ineffectual
.
<EOS>
the
rout
of
the
Royalists
be
then
complete
,
and
all
who
could
escape
the
enemy
's
sword
flee
to
St.
John
's
,
where
General
Dalyell
's
brigade
be
quarter

and
where
it

victorious
Parliamentarians

stop

such
be
not

<EOS>
earlier

Dalyell
refuse

down
their

when
a
Highland
soldier
arrive
in
breathless
haste
bring
intelligence
that
his
leader
have
be
route
by
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
Charles
could
scarcely
credit
the
news
,
but
on
ascertain
the
full
extent
of
the
disaster
,
he
feel
the
necessity
of
immediately
return
to
the
city
,
and
prepare
against
an
attack
on
the
south
,
which
may
now
be
expect
.
 
<EOS>
He
therefore
ride
back
with
his
attendant
,
cross
the
river
at
the
palace
-
ferry
,
and
at
once
proceed
to
the
Sidbury
-
gate
,
where
he
find
the
Duke
of
Hamilton
.
<EOS>
from
the
watch
post
on
the
summit
of
the
cathedral
tower
,
the
duke
have
already
hear
of
Pitscottie
's
defeat
and
the
construction
of
the
fly
bridge
across
the
Teme
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
for
a
moment
attempt
to
disguise
the
perilous
position
in
which
his
majesty
would
be
place
if
Montgomery
should
be
worst
at
Powick
,
and
coincide
with
the
king
in
opinion
that
the
general
attack
should
not
be
delay
,
but
advise
that
a
visit
should
first
be
pay
to
Lesley
,
whom
he
have
not
as
yet
see
that
morning
.
 
<EOS>
act
upon
this
counsel
,
Charles
,
attend
by
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
Lord
Wilmot
,
Careless
,
and
a
small
escort
,
ride
to
the
Blockhouse
field
,
where
Lesley
be
station
with
his
scottish
horse
.
<EOS>
He
find
him
with
the
whole
of
his
large
force
under
arm
,
and
apparently
ready
for
action
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
help
notice
that
Lesley
look
exceedingly
grave
,
and
not
altogether
free
from
uneasiness
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
this
man
really
the
traitor
he
be
generally
think
?
<EOS>
"
mentally
ejaculated
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
him
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Lesley
,
"
he
cry
,
as
he
ride
up
,
"
I
be
resolve
to
take
yon
battery
on
Perry
Wood
.
<EOS>
bid
your
man
prepare
for
the
attack
.
<EOS>
I
shall
lead
them
in
person
.
"
 
<EOS>
on
receive
this
command
,
Lesley
immediately
draw
near
the
king
,
and
say
,
in
a
low
voice
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
beseech
you
not
to
call
upon
them
to
make
the
attack
,
sire
.
<EOS>
They
will
not
follow
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
follow
me
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Charles
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
Lesley
,
you
be
a
traitor
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
tell
you
,
sire
,
"
reply
Lesley
,
in
the
same
low
voice
,
"
that
the
man
be
not
to
be
rely
on
.
<EOS>
They
will
not
fight
with
your
cavalier
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
will
they
do
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
demand
Charles
,
sternly
.
"
<EOS>
Will
they
utterly
desert
me
in
my
hour
of
need
?
<EOS>
Will
they
deliver
me
to
the
enemy
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
sire
;
but
if
,
in
obedience
to
your
command
,
I
order
them
to
attack
yon
battery
,
not
one
of
them
will
stir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
just
then
the
roar
of
artillery
be
hear
.
<EOS>
the
battery
have
open
fire
on
Fort
Royal
,
and
be
immediately
answer
--
as
we
have
already
describe
--
by
the
Royalist
engineer
.
<EOS>
the
din
be
heighten
by
the
small
ordnance
of
the
Blockhouse
,
which
now
begin
to
operate
--
though
with
little
effect
--
against
Cromwell
's
intrenchment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can
you
hear
this
,
and
stand
tamely
by
?
<EOS>
"
observe
Charles
,
reproachfully
,
to
Lesley
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
help
it
,
my
liege
,
"
be
the
scottish
leader
's
answer
.
<EOS>
"
My
man
be
mutinous
and
will
not
obey
me
.
<EOS>
look
at
them
now
,
and
you
will
be
convince
that
I
speak
the
truth
.
<EOS>
but
do
not
,
I
entreat
you
,
compel
me
to
put
their
disloyalty
to
the
proof
.
"
 
<EOS>
Charles
cast
his
eye
along
the
line
near
him
,
and
the
sullen
and
discontent
aspect
of
the
man
fully
confirm
Lesley
's
assertion
.
 
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Derby
have
likewise
take
a
rapid
survey
of
the
regiment
,
and
come
to
a
like
conclusion
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
mutinous
spirit
evidently
prevail
among
the
man
,
"
he
say
to
the
king
,
"
and
may
break
out
at
once
,
if
an
attempt
be
make
to
force
them
into
action
.
<EOS>
leave
Lesley
to
manage
them
.
<EOS>
He
can
do
it
,
if
he
will
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
the
confound
Kirk
committee
that
have
be
at
work
with
them
,
"
cry
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
Lesley
,
"
he
add
,
in
a
low
significant
tone
to
the
scottish
leader
,
"
you
will
gain
nothing
by
desert
me
;
but
much--
very
much
--
by
stand
firmly
by
me
at
this
critical
juncture
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
liege
,
"
say
Lesley
,
earnestly
,
"
if
you
be
in
jeopardy
,
I
will
bring
you
aid
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
promise
more
.
"
 
<EOS>
oblige
to
be
content
with
this
,
Charles
ride
off
with
his
attendant
and
escort
,
and
regardless
of
the
enemy
's
fire
,
which
be
now
extend
along
the
height
and
increase
in
fury
,
proceed
to
visit
his
various
outpost
.
 
<EOS>
very
little
impression
be
produce
upon
Fort
Royal
by
the
heavy
cannonade
direct
against
it
from
Perry
Wood
,
nor
be
any
immediate
attempt
make
by
the
enemy
to
storm
it
.
 
<EOS>
Lilburn
and
Lord
Grey
of
Groby
gradually
draw
closer
to
the
royalist
outpost
,
but
seem
to
be
await
the
Lord
General
's
signal
for
the
grand
attack
.
<EOS>
and
such
,
in
reality
,
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
from
the
apparent
inertness
of
the
enemy
it
be
erroneously
suppose
by
the
Royalists
that
most
of
the
parliamentary
troop
have
be
draw
to
the
other
side
of
the
Severn
.
<EOS>
cromwell
,
however
,
have
a
motive
for
all
he
do
,
and
if
he
delay
the
attack
,
it
be
because
he
deem
the
right
moment
for
make
it
have
not
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
never
be
he
more
cheerful
than
he
appear
to
be
throughout
this
try
day
.
<EOS>
confident
of
victory
,
he
yet
keep
a
watchful
look
-
out
upon
the
enemy
,
and
seem
surprised
that
the
attack
,
which
he
expect
the
king
to
make
upon
him
,
should
be
so
long
delay
.
<EOS>
for
this
attack
,
come
when
it
may
,
he
be
fully
prepared
;
but
as
evening
begin
to
draw
on
,
and
no
movement
be
make
by
the
royal
force
,
he
grow
impatient
.
 
<EOS>
"
Time
will
scarcely
be
allow
us
for
the
work
,
"
he
say
to
the
officer
with
him
,
"
yet
will
I
not
move
till
I
have
full
assurance
that
Fleetwood
and
Ingoldsby
be
master
of
St.
John
's
,
and
ready
to
enter
the
city
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
this
moment
a
messenger
ride
up
bring
the
intelligence
he
so
eagerly
desire
.
 
<EOS>
Montgomery
be
utterly
route
--
<EOS>
Keith
a
prisoner
--
<EOS>
Dalyell
have
surrender
.
<EOS>
Fleetwood
and
Ingoldsby
be
prepare
to
cross
the
bridge
,
and
enter
the
city
.
<EOS>
Lambert
be
march
towards
the
bridge
of
boat
,
and
would
soon
bring
his
regiment
to
Perry
Wood
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
sum
of
the
despatch
.
<EOS>
the
messenger
have
to
take
a
circuitous
route
,
or
it
would
have
be
deliver
sooner
.
 
<EOS>
Cromwell
could
not
conceal
his
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
Lord
of
Hosts
be
with
us
,
"
he
exclaim
.
"
<EOS>
His
holy
arm
hath
get
us
the
victory
.
<EOS>
nothing
remain
but
to
finish
the
work
so
well
begin
.
<EOS>
on
this
day
twelvemonth
,
at
Dunbar
,
the
word
be
,
'
the
Lord
of
Hosts
.
'
<EOS>
so
let
it
be
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
the
signal
then
be
,
'
We
have
no
white
about
us
.
'
<EOS>
the
same
signal
shall
serve
now
.
<EOS>
make
this
know
throughout
the
regiment
,
and
then
prepare
for
action
.
"
 
<EOS>
while
issue
these
order
,
Cromwell
have
notice
a
movement
at
the
Sidbury
-
gate
,
and
now
fix
his
field
-
glass
upon
the
spot
he
perceive
that
the
main
body
of
the
royal
army
,
horse
and
foot
,
be
come
forth
from
the
gate
,
evidently
for
the
purpose
of
attack
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
at
no
loss
to
discover
that
the
host
be
command
by
the
king
in
person
,
and
that
Charles
be
attend
by
several
of
his
most
distinguished
noble
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
from
a
close
survey
,
he
feel
certain
that
the
Dukes
of
Hamilton
and
Buckingham
be
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
splendid
sight
to
see
that
gallant
host
issue
forth
from
the
gate
,
and
familiar
as
he
be
with
such
spectacle
,
Cromwell
watch
it
for
some
minute
with
great
interest
--
note
the
strength
of
each
regiment
,
and
make
many
shrewd
observation
to
his
own
officer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Charles
Stuart
hath
come
forth
in
all
his
bravery
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
but
he
and
all
his
host
shall
be
utterly
discomfited
.
<EOS>
up
,
and
smite
them
.
<EOS>
spare
none
of
the
malignant
.
<EOS>
as
to
their
prince
,
take
him
not
captive
,
but
slay
him
without
pity
.
"
 
<EOS>
many
circumstance
have
conspire
to
prevent
Charles
from
make
the
attack
he
have
meditate
upon
the
enemy
until
so
late
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
learn
that
Dalyell
have
surrender
he
no
longer
hesitate
,
but
march
forth
as
we
have
just
describe
.
<EOS>
He

by
the
Dukes
of
Buckingham
and
Hamilton
,
the
Earl

Lord
Wilmot

Sir
Alexander

and
several
other
distinguished
personage

and
have
with
him
his
good
infantry
and
cavalry
,
and
his
brave
cavalier

than
a
general
charge
be
make
on
Perry
Wood
,
each
division
take
its
appoint
course
.
 
<EOS>
such
be
the
impetuosity
of
the
Cavaliers
who
form
the
central
body
lead
by
the
king
,
that
they
drive
back
Cromwell
's
body
-
guard
who
ride
down
the
hill
to
meet
them
,
and
rush
on
with
irresistible
fury
break
through
the
picket

force
the
intrenchment
,
and
put
the
artillerymen
to
the
sword
,
actually
obtain
possession
of
the
enemy
's
large
gun
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
brief
space
Charles
,
who
have
lead
this
wonderful
charge
--
the
most
brilliant
feat
perform
at
the
fight
of
Worcester
--
seem
master
of
the
position
.
<EOS>
He
be
on
the
very
spot
just
occupy
by
Cromwell
himself
,
and
have
take
his
gun
.
<EOS>
the
valiant
Cavaliers
who
attend
their
sovereign
raise
a
shout
of
triumph

strike
the

with
their
sword

<EOS>
Colonel
Legge
,
indeed
,
have
save
the
king
's
life
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
singular
sight
to
see
the
royal
party
on
the
top
of
the
hill
in
the
midst
of
the
parliamentarian
force
.
<EOS>
but
their
position
seem
scarcely
tenable
,
though
Hamilton
and
Derby
be
press
on
,
on
either
side
,
to
their
aid
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
Charles
exult
in
his
brief
triumph

and
his
exultation
be
share
by
his
companion

hitherto
invincible

retreat
before

animate
by

success

all
before

a
most
important

have
be
obtain
by
the
capture

ceaseless
cannonade

at

critical
juncture

when
his
fate
hang
in
the
balance

and
when
the
scottish
horse
may

him
to
victory

Charles
look
anxiously
down
to
the
spot
where
Lesley
be
post
.
<EOS>
He
be
still
there
with
his
troop

they
remain
motionless

although
their
leader
must
have
be
aware
of

success

must
have
feel
how
important

<EOS>
the
conflict
last
for
a
considerable
time
--
much
longer

indeed

than
Cromwell

but
when
Lambert

with
his

and
the

<EOS>
besides
,
their

be
completely
exhaust

and
they
be

<EOS>
after
a
most
obstinate
but
ineffectual

<EOS>
no

move
his
regiment
towards
Barbourne
Bridge
,
about
a
mile
on
the
north
of
the
city
,
and
close
to
Pitchcroft

<EOS>
no
sooner
do
Cromwell

engineer
regain
possession
of
the
great
gun
than
they
begin
to
cannonade
Fort

with
redouble
fury

<EOS>
under

the

so
close
to
it
,
cause
terrible
havoc

and
drive
all
the
artillerymen

<EOS>
but
we

<EOS>
so

while

<EOS>
from

and
fierce
cry

:
 
"

Tis

several

but
though
the
bullet

no

<EOS>
most
luckily
his
horse
be
not
hurt
,
but
bear
him
swiftly
and
safely
to
the
Sidbury

gate
.
<EOS>
He
be
hotly
pursue
by
the
Roundhead
trooper

who
would
assuredly
have
cut
him
down
,
accord
to
Cromwell
's
order
,
if
they
have
come
up
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
on

to
his
dismay

that
it

without

hesitation
,
the
king

himself
from

and
contrive
to

<EOS>
as

who

his
majesty
,
be
of
infinite
service
to
him
in

once
more
on

Charles
ride
up
to
the
high

street
,
and
find
it
full
of
soldier
,
most
of
them
belong
to
the
scottish
infantry
.
<EOS>
They
have
all
a
most
dejected
look
,
and
on
see
him
,
many
of
them
throw
down
their
arm
,
to
intimate
their
refusal
to
fight
any
longer
.
<EOS>
in
vain
he
ride
up
and
down
their
rank
,
with
his
feather
hat
in
his
hand
,
address
them
with
a
passionate
eloquence
that
ought
to
have

<EOS>
"

Ours

in
the

"
 
<EOS>
Finding
,
however
,
that
they
would
not
stir
,
he
call
out
in
accent
of
bitter
reproach
,
"
recreant
that
you

me
thus
,
if
you

<EOS>
how
the
ENEMY
enter

<EOS>
meanwhile

a
sharp
conflict

place
outside
the
Sidbury

gate
between
a
party
of
fly
Royalists
and
a
troop
of
horse
under
Colonel
Pride

<EOS>
the
unlucky
Royalists
be
unable
to

the
obstacle
before

and
,
after
a

the

themselves
through
the
low
street
of
the
city

and
commence
plunder
the
house

<EOS>
the
loyal
city
be
now
pay
the
penalty
of
its
devotion
to
the
king

<EOS>
terror
and
confusion

<EOS>
door
be
burst
open
,
and
the
most
horrible
threat
be
answer
by
shriek
and
cry
for
pity
,
but
no
pity
be
show
by
the
ferocious
soldiery
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
Fort
Royal
have
be
storm
,
as
we
have
already
relate
,
and
its
gun
be

upon
the

the
destruction

the
terror
of
the
inhabitant

<EOS>
desperate
fighting
be
go
on
in

and
nothing
be

but
the
clash
of
steel
,
the
sharp
ring
of
musketry
,
and
the
roar
of
artillery
,
mingle
with
shout
and
cry
.
 
<EOS>
Fleetwood
and
Ingoldsby
have
now
force
their

across
the

but
their
entrance
into

by
such
force
as
could
be
rally
by
Lord
Wilmot
,
Colonel
Blague
,
Colonel
Lane
,
and
other
,
but
the
contest
be
too
unequal

and
could
not

<EOS>
as
both
horse

foot
be
now
continually
pour
into
the
city
on

conflict
be
take
place
in
almost

<EOS>
there
be
desperate

<EOS>
there

near
the

--
for
the
Foregate
,
as
already

have
be

and
,
indeed
,
the
enemy
chiefly
enter
the
city
from
the
Sidbury
-
gate
,
from
Friars'-gate
,
and
from
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
great
deal
of
fighting
in
Friars'-street
,
Lichstreet

and
multitude
of
armed
citizen

artillerymen
who

<EOS>
hundred

none
with
arm

and
the

full
of
dead
body
.
 
<EOS>
the
scottish
infantry
tamely
surrender
,
and
be
shut
up
in
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
They
have
better
have
die
valiantly
,
for
they
be
afterwards
sell
as
slave
to
the
plantation
.
<EOS>
but
other
scottish
regiment
behave
with
the
great
resolution
,
and
if
all
have
do
equally
well
,
the
result
of
the

may
have
be
different
.
<EOS>
Castle
Hill
,
as
we

have
be
strongly

and
be
hold
by
the
Earl
of
Rothes
,
Sir
William
Hamilton

with

loyal

<EOS>
the
fortress
be
attack
by
Lambert
and
Harrison

but
be
so
obstinately
defended
that
its
leader

<EOS>
have
thus
endeavour

describe
the
frightful
condition
to
which
the

reduce
by
the
entrance
of
the
enemy
,
we
will
now
return
to
Charles
,
whom
we

proceed
in
a
most
melancholy
frame
of
mind
,
and
wholly
unattende
,
towards
the
College
Green
.
<EOS>
so
cast
down
be
he
at
the
moment
that
he
scarcely
take
note
of
anything
that

around
him
,
when
he
be
suddenly
rouse
from
his
fit
of
despondency
by
see
a
large
troop

It

this
discovery
he
immediately
ride
up
,
and
be
welcome
with
the
great
delight
by
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
as
well
as
by
his
faithful
attendant
Careless
.
<EOS>
the
great
uneasiness
have
be
feel
for
his
safety
,
and
it
be
fear
he
may
have
fall
into
the
hand
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
nor
be
the
Cavaliers
compose
the
troop
less
delighted
,
and
their
enthusiasm
quickly
raise
his
drooping
spirit
.
<EOS>
He
put
himself
at
their
head
,
and
,
despite
the
entreaty
of
the
Earl
of
Derby
that
he
would
seek
safety
in
flight
,
he
lead
them
towards
the
Sidbury

<EOS>
as
on
all
previous
occasion

the
first
advantage
be
with
the
Cavaliers
,
but
Pride
and
his

back
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
it
be
discover
that
Charles
be
with
the
party
,
an
attempt
be
make
by
Pride
to
capture
him
,
and
it
would
have
be
successful
if
Careless
have
not
fly
to
his
rescue
.
 
<EOS>
the
Cavaliers
still
make
a
desperate
struggle
,
but
it
be
evident
they
could
not
hold
out
long
.
<EOS>
Charles

who

a
few
minute
in

<EOS>
by
degree
the
calmness

beauty
of
the

produce
a

<EOS>
what
a

between

through

with

<EOS>
have
pass
Beveré

through

at

without

they

pursue

turn
off
at

where
the

drink

they

nothing
can
be
pleasanter

under

a
gallop
across

danger
lurk

when

the

deceive
by
the
gathering
gloom

the

be
apt
to
suspect

the

lie
in

to
turn

from

<EOS>
this
be
the
case
with

<EOS>
They
avoid
Stourport
because
they
fancy
there
be

in

shape
their

course
past
the

be
garrison

the

afford

shelter
for

they
do
not

there

<EOS>
They
be
still
on
Hartlebury
Common
,
and
be
soon
close
upon
Kidderminster
,
but
do
not
deem
it
prudent
to
enter
the
town
.
<EOS>
skirt
the
valley
in
which
it
lie
,
and
gallop
past
Hoobrook
,
they
proceed
by
Chester

lane
and
Green
Hill
to
broadwater
.
<EOS>
thence
up
Black
Hill
to
Sion
Hill
.
<EOS>
next
traverse
the
beautiful
woody
district
that
now
form
Lea

,
they
descend
a
gentle
acclivity
that
bring
them
to
the
old
bridge
across
the
Stour

<EOS>
have
there
be
light
enough
to
distinguish
it
<EOS>
,
a
charming
scene
would
have
be
here
present

gaze

<EOS>
but
he
cross
Hay
Bridge
without
look
at
the
beautifully
wind
river
or
at
the
precipitous
rock
on
its
opposite
bank
,
<EOS>
well
satisfied
that
there
be
no
enemy
conceal
amid
the
wood
to
dispute
his
passage

<EOS>
by
the
time
the
troop
reach
Kinver
Heath
it
have
become
quite
dark
,

the
guide
declare
it
be
impossible
to
cross
the
wild
and
boggy
waste
at
that
hour

<EOS>
notwithstanding
their
representation
,
the
king
would
have
push
on
at
all
hazard
,
but
the
Earl
of
Derby

Charles
Giffard
,
and
Careless
,
who
know
the
heath
,
dissuade
him
from
his
rash
design

<EOS>
Lord

think
there
would
be
far
less
danger
in
pass
through
Stourbridge
,
even
if
it
should
be
occupy
by
militia

which
be
doubtful

than
in

<EOS>
besides

if

we

"
as

observe
the
Earl
of
Derby
.

"
<EOS>
but
no

<EOS>
in
the
event
of

all

who
be
near
your

my

<EOS>
the
party
then
turn
towards
Stourton
,
and
once
more
cross
the
Stour
by
the
Stewponey
Bridge
,
gallop
on
towards
Stourbridge

<EOS>
when
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
town
they
come
to
a
halt
,
and
Careless
and
Captain
Giffard
be
send
on
to
reconnoitre
.
 
<EOS>
as
Stourbridge
at
that
time
consist
only
of
one
long
street
,
it
be
easy
to
ascertain
whether
any
soldier
be
on
the
watch
,
but
none
could
be
discover
.
<EOS>
the
street
be
entirely
desert
,
all
the
inhabitant
have
,
apparently
,
retire
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
perfectly
satisfied
with
their
inspection
,
Careless
and
Giffard
return
to
the
royal
party
,
and
inform
his
majesty
that
he
may
proceed
without
fear
.
<EOS>
Charles
do
not
question
the
information
he
have
receive
,
but
judge
it
safe
to
speed
through
the
town
,
place
himself
at
the
head
of
the
troop
,
and
gallop
along
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
rouse
by
the
clatter
of
the
horse
'
hoofs
,
several
of
the
inhabitant
rush
to
the
window
,
and
just
catch
sight
of
the
fly
cavalcade
.
 
<EOS>
the
Royalists

however
,
have
not
get
far
when
a
drum
be
loudly
beat

"
show
that
Careless

<EOS>
It
presently
appear
that
a
company
of
militia
be
quarter
at
the
further
end
of
the
town

their
steed
be
ready

quickly

street
to
check
the
fugitive

<EOS>
but
they
do
not
succeed
in
their
purpose
.
<EOS>
the
king
and
his
companion
draw
their
sword
,
and
dash
upon
them
with
such
impetuosity
that
they
cut
their
way
through
the
phalanx

and
do
not

<EOS>
Charles

gallop
on

so

"
 
<EOS>
on
reach
the
White
Horse
the
fugitive
Royalists
find
much
well
entertainment
than
may
have
be
expect
.
<EOS>
Nat
Coulter
be
in
bed
,
but
he
be
soon
rouse
from
his
slumber
,
and
with
his
wife
and
his
two
son
set
heartily
to
work
to
serve
his
unexpected
guest
.
<EOS>
He
have
plenty
of
ale
and
cider
,
with
which
the
Cavaliers
be
perfectly
content
,
but
only
a
single
runlet
of
canary
.
<EOS>
however
,
this
amply
suffice
for
the
king

the
chief
personage
with
him

as
to
provision

they
run
rather
short
,
Nat
Coulter
's
larder
not

abundantly

the
hungry
Royalists
devour
all
they

though
Nat

be
know
to
be
loyal

Charles
do
not
discover
himself
to
them

but
speak
French

be
address
in
that
language
by
his
attendant
during
his
stay
at
the
White
Horse

<EOS>
Nat
,
however
,
be
a

afterwards
declare

upon
seek
a
refuge
in
Boscobel

<EOS>
He
have
not
abandon
this
design
,
though
during
the
nocturnal
ride
his
plan
have
undergo
some
change
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
propose
that
the
king
should
proceed
in
the
first
instance
to
White
Ladies
,
another
secluded
house
belong
to
the
Giffards
,
about
a
mile
distant
from
Boscobel
,
where
arrangement
could
be
make
for
his
majesty
's
safety
,
and
where
he
could
separate
from
his
companion
.
<EOS>
both
the
Earl
of
Derby
and
Roscarrock
agree
that
this
would
be
the
good
and
safe
course
to
pursue
,
and
it
be
decide
upon
by
his
majesty

<EOS>
again
mount
their
steed

well

track
the

but
the

and
be
march
northward
,
as
they
learn

reproach
for
not
go

<EOS>
when
on
return
to
the
house
,
he
find
Richard
Penderel
with
the
suit
of
clothe
intend
for
the
king
's
disguise
,
and
immediately
take
them
to
his
majesty
.
<EOS>
that
nothing
should
be
want
,
Trusty
Dick
have
bring
a
coarse
shirt
and
a
wood

man
's
cap
with
the
garment
,
and
in
a
few
minute
Charles
have
take
off
his
rich
apparel
,
and
put
on
the
sturdy
forester
's
habiliment
.
<EOS>
His
buff
coat
and
broadsword

belt

replace
by
a
leathern
doublet

jerkin
of
green
cloth

by
Careless

astonish
by
the
alteration
in
the
king

appearance
.
<EOS>
both
aver
that
his

look
just
like
one
of
themselves

would
impose
on
the
most
suspicious
rebel

manner
.
<EOS>
the
eld
Penderel
could
not
repress
a
smile
as
he
regard
him
.
<EOS>
the
sole
objection
urge
by
those
who
scrutinise
the
newly
-
make
forester
's
appearance
be
that
his
hand
be
too
white
,
but
this
be
quickly
remedie
by
a
little
charcoal
dust
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
be
dark
enough
,
be
as
brown
as
that
of
a
gipsy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
majesty
must
be
careful
not
to
answer

you

you
have
not

and
NOWHERE

<EOS>
on
quit
the

,
Charles
and
his
two
stalwart
attendant
enter
the
ruin
of
the
old
priory
,
where
Trusty
Dick
,
by
the
aid
of
the
ivy
,
climb
the
massive
wall
,
and
look
around
to
satisfy
himself
that
all
be
secure
.
<EOS>
not
perceive
anything
to
occasion
alarm
,
he
soon
descend
from
his
post
of
observation
,
and
the
party
leave
the
ruin
and
enter
the
wood
at
the
rear
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
pursue
a
roadway
among
the
tree
,
they
march
on
at
a
quick
pace
.
<EOS>
on
either
side
there
be
a
good
deal
of
fine
timber
,
and
several
ancient
oak
catch
the
king
's
eye
as
he
stride
along
.
<EOS>
presently
they
come
upon
a
broad
clearing
,
where
the
underwood
have
be
remove
,
only
a
few
scatter
tree
be
leave
,
and
have
cross
it
,
they
penetrate
a
wilderness
of
bramble
and
thorn
,
through
which
Charles
could
never
have
make
his
way
unassisted
,
and
this
rough
barrier
pass
,
they
reach
a
waste
overgrow
with
short
wood
,
which
be
cut
at
certain
season
for
fuel
.
<EOS>
this
be
Spring
Coppice
,
and
just
beyond
it
be
the
shady
grove
of
Boscobel
.
 
<EOS>
though
there
be
few
large
tree
in
Spring
Coppice
,
there
be
a
good
deal
of
tangle
underwood
,
and
a
thick
covert
afford
an
excellent
place
of
concealment
.
<EOS>
It
be
towards
this
spot
that
his
guide
now
lead
the
king
.
<EOS>
while
the
covert
be
almost
impenetrable
to
those
unacquainted
with
it
,
there
be
an
outlet
to
the
Boscobel
wood
,
which
could
be
easily
gain
in
case
of
need
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
very
heart
of
the
covert
,
like
the
centre
of
a
maze
,
there
be
a
small
open
space
,
free
from
underwood
,
and
cover
with
a
carpet
of
smooth
sward
.
<EOS>
here
it
be
propose
that
the
king
should
remain
,
while
his
two
guide
undertake
to
act
as
scout
and
sentinel
,
and
warn
him
of
any
danger
.
<EOS>
have
show
his
majesty
how
to
hide
himself
amid
the
underwood
,
and
how
to
gain
the
outlet
into
the
adjoin
thicket
,
they
leave
him
,
promise
that
one
of
them
would
return
ere
long
.
 
<EOS>
almost
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
Charles
be
now
completely
alone
.
<EOS>
yesterday
,
at
the
same
hour
,
he
be
a
king
,
and
have
an
army
at
his
command
.
<EOS>
now
he
be
dependent
for
his
safety
upon
a
few
loyal
rustic
.
<EOS>
not
for
a
moment
do
he
doubt
their
fidelity
,
or
believe
that
threat
of
punishment
or
offer
of
reward
would
induce
them
to
betray
him
.
<EOS>
yet
accident
may
bring
his
enemy
to
his
place
of
concealment
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
he
be
resolve
to
sell
his
life
dearly
,
though
the
only
weapon
he
possess
be
the
woodman
's
knife
in
his
girdle
.
 
<EOS>
He
strove
to
divert
his
melancholy
thought
and
while
away
the
time
by
pace
round
and
round
the
little
circular
spot
in
which
he
be
enclose
.
<EOS>
but
he
soon
get
tired
of
this
enforced
exercise
,
and
throw
himself
at
full
length
on
the
sward
.
<EOS>
how
he
wish
that
Careless
be
with
him
,
or
Lord
Wilmot
!
<EOS>
to
add
to
his
discomfort
,
the
morning
,
which
have
be
dark
and
dull
,
become
still
more
gloomy
;
cloud
gather
overhead
,
and
at
length
discharge
themselves
in
a
steady
down
-
pour
.
<EOS>
He
seek
shelter
among
the
tree
,
but
could
not
protect
himself
entirely
from
the
wet
.
 
<EOS>
the
rain
continue
--
heavily
,
heavily
.
 
<EOS>
several
hour
pass
,
which
seem
more
wearisome
,
more
dismal
than
any
hour
the
king
have
ever
previously
spend
.
 
<EOS>
during
the
long
and
dreary
interval
no
one
come
near
him
,
nor
do
any
sound
reach
his
ear
,
except
the
ceaseless
pattering
of
the
rain
upon
the
leave
.
<EOS>
now
and
then
he
hear
the
rustle
of
a
rabbit
among
the
underwood
,
the
cry
of
a
blackbird
,
or
the
challenge
of
a
cock
pheasant
.
<EOS>
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
no
whistle
from
Careless
--
no

from

<EOS>
have
now
no
watch
he
could
not
tell
how

,
but
he
think
it
much
later
than
it
really
be

<EOS>
at
last
he
hear
sound
of
some
one
approach
,
and
a

easily
recognise
as

,
and
I
myself
have
be
scare
by
'
em
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
length
they
emerge
from
the
forest
,
and
get
upon
a
wide
common--
greatly
to
the
king
's
relief
for
he
have
begin
to
feel
oppress
by
the
gloom
.
<EOS>
the
fresh
air
,
so
different
from
the
damp
atmosphere
he
have
just
be
inhale
,
laden
with
the
scent
of
decay
leave
and
timber
,
produce
an
exhilarating
effect
upon
him
,
and
he
stride
along
vigorously
.
 
<EOS>
while
cross
the
common
,
they
descry
a
patrol
of
horse
apparently
proceed
in
the
direction
of
White
Ladies
or
Boscobel
,
but
they
easily
avoid
them
,
and
quit
the
common
,
they
soon
afterwards
mount
a
steep
hill
,
on
the
other
side
of
which
be
a
brook
that
turn
a
water
-
mill
.
<EOS>
as
they
draw
near
the
mill
,
the
sound
of
voice
bring
them
to
a
halt
.
<EOS>
the
hour
be
now
late
,
it
be
singular
that
any
person
should
be
astir
,
and
Trusty
Dick
,
naturally
alarm
by
the
circumstance
,
at
first
thought
of
turn
back
.
<EOS>
but
to
do
so
would
have
take
him
and
his
companion
considerably
out
of
their
course
,
and
he
therefore
hesitate
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
Evelith
Mill
,
"
he
observe
in
a
low
voice
to
Charles
.
"
<EOS>
Roger
Bushell
,
the
miller
,
be
a
cross
-
grain
fellow
,
and
I
think
a
Roundhead
,
so
I
should
not
like
to
trust
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
safe
not
,
"
reply
the
king
.
<EOS>
"
how
far
be
we
from
Madeley
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
about
two
mile
,
"
reply
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
but
if
we
be
oblige
to
turn
back
it
will
add
another
mile
,
at
least
,
to
the
distance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
let
us
go
on
,
"
say
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
so
they
wait
quietly
for
a
few
minute
,
when
the
light
disappear
,
and
the
voice
become
hush
.
 
<EOS>
"
Roger
Bushell
have
go
to
bed
at
last
,
"
observe
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
We
may
proceed
on
our
way
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
they
march
on
without
fear
.
<EOS>
but
the
king
be
wrong
in
his
supposition
,
for
as
they
pass
the
mill
a
gruff
voice
call
out
,
"
who
go
there
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
the
miller
himself
;
"
whisper
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
answer
him
,
"
say
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
again
the
challenge
be
repeat
,
and
more
authoritatively
than
before
,
"
who
be
you
?
<EOS>
speak
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Friends
,
"
reply
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
not
,
"
cry
the
sturdy
miller
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
be
friend
,
stand
and
give
an
account
of
yourself
,
or
sure
as
I
be
an
honest
man
,
and
you
be
a
couple
of
rogue
,
I
will
knock
you
down
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
he
brandish
a
stout
staff
as
he
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
shall
we
do
?
"
ask
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
"
beat
a
retreat
,
"
reply
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
do
to
be
stop
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
as
the
miller
rush
forth
to
seize
them
they
hurry
off
;
and
ascend
another
hill
,
never
stop
till
they
be
quite
out
of
breath
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
most
disgraceful
retreat
,
I
must
say
,
Dick
,
"
observe
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
have
knock
the
dust
out
of
Roger
Bushell
's
jerkin
,
"
rejoin
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
be
certain
he
have
get
some
rebel
with
him

FRANCIS
WOOLFE
at
MADELEY
COURT
 
<EOS>
It
be
past
midnight
when
Charles
approach
Madeley
,
an
ancient
moated
mansion
build
of
stone
,
and
very
pleasantly
situate
on
the
border
of
the
Severn
.
<EOS>
It
belong
to
Mr.
Francis
Woolfe
,
an
old
Cavalier
,
and
father
of
the
gallant
Captain
Woolfe
,
who
figure
at
an
early
period
of
this
history
.
<EOS>
as
the
hour
be
late
,
Mr.
Woolfe
and
his
family
,
with
the
whole
of
his
household
,
have
long
since
retire
to
rest
,
but
they
be
disturb
by
a
loud
knock
at
the
door
,
which
continue
with
very
little
intermission
until
the
old
gentleman
get
up
,
and
,
accompany
by
his
butler
,
go
to
see
what
be
the
matter
.
<EOS>
on
open
the
door
he
find
Richard
Penderel
,
who
be
well
known
to
him
,
and
without
give
the
forester
time
to
explain
his
errand
,
eagerly
inquire
whether
he
bring
any
tiding
of
Captain
Woolfe
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
my
son
be
present
at
the
battle
of
Worcester
,
"
cry
the
old
Cavalier
;
"
and
I
fear
he
may
be
wound
,
as
I
have
not
hear
of
him
since
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
I
can
not
relieve
your
honour
's
anxiety
respect
your
son
,
"
reply
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
well
know
how
staunch
a
royalist
you
be
,
I
be
come
to
beg
you
to
hide
a
fugitive
Cavalier
,
who
fight
,
like
Captain
Woolfe
,
at
Worcester
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
do
not
ask
me
to
do
it
,
Dick!--don't
ask
me!--I
dare
not
harbour
a
royalist
!
"
cry
Mr.
Woolfe
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
willingly
--
right
willingly
would
I
do
so
,
but
there
be
too
much
hazard
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
already
suspect
by
the
rebel
--
there
be
a
company
of
militia
at
Madeley
,
guard
the
bridge
and
the
river
--
and
be
they
to
search
my
house
and
find
a
fugitive
royalist
conceal
within
it
<EOS>
I
should
be
most
heavily
fine
--
perhaps
imprison
--
perhaps
put
to
death
!
<EOS>
no
,
Dick
,
I
will
not
run
this
risk
for
any
one
,
except
the
king
himself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
what
will
your
honour
say
when
I
tell
you
that
he
whom
I
ask
you
to
shelter
from
his
enemy
be
the
king
?
<EOS>
the
loyal
Mr.
Francis
Woolfe
,
I
be
well
assured
,
will
never
refuse
his
sovereign
an
asylum
.

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
right
,
my
good
fellow
--
<EOS>
you
be
right
,
"
cry
the
old
Cavalier
,
tremble
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
suppose
it
be
the
king
.
<EOS>
why
do
you
not
tell
me
so
at
first
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
because
his
majesty
forbid
me
,
"
rejoin
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
disobey
his
order
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
he
may
have
trust
me
,
"
cry
Mr.
Woolfe
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
lay
down
my
life
for
him
.
<EOS>
where
be
his
majesty
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
on
the
other
side
of
the
moat
stand
beneath
yon
great
elm
-
tree
,
"
say
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
Cavalier
require
no
more
,
but
hastily
cross
the
bridge
,
proceed
to
the
spot
indicate
,
follow
by
his
butler
and
Richard
Penderel
.
 
<EOS>
see
him
<EOS>
advance
Charles
come
forward
,
and
as
they
meet
old
Mr.

throw
himself
on
his
knee
,
while
Charles
,
find
himself
discover
,
give
him
his
hand
to
kiss
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sire
,
"
cry
the
old
Cavalier
,
"
I
never
think
to
see
you
at
Madeley
under
such
sad
circumstance
.
<EOS>
My
house
and
all
within
it
be
yours
.
<EOS>
enter
,
I
pray
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
with
as
much
ceremony
as
if
Charles
have
be
a
conqueror
instead
of
a
fugitive
,
he
conduct
him
across
the
bridge
and
usher
him
into
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
for
a
few
minute
he
detain
his
majesty
in
the
hall
while
the
dining
-
room
be
light
up
,
and
when
all
be
ready
he
lead
him
thither
.
 
<EOS>
to
his
infinite
surprise
Charles
find
an
excellent
repast
await
him
,
and
he
be
serve
at
it
by
his
host
and
the
butler
.
<EOS>
seat
in
this
large
comfortable
room
,
treat
with
so
much
ceremony
,
and
supply
with
some
of
the
fine
claret
he
have
ever
taste
,
for
a
brief
space
he
almost
forget
his
misfortune
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
would
not
yield
to
false
security
,
and
after
empty
his
goblet
he
question
Mr.
Woolfe
as
to
the
possibility
of
cross
the
Severn
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
Cavalier
shake
his
head
dolefully
.
<EOS>
It
be
utterly
impossible
,
the
bridge
be
guard
by
the
militia
,
and
all
the
boat
seize
.
<EOS>
His
majesty
must
be
content
to
stay
at
Madeley
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Woolfe
do
not
like
to
make
such
a
suggestion
,
but
as
he
have
no
safe
hiding
-
place
,
and
as
a
search
may
be
make
by
the
rebel
at
any
moment
,
he
would
venture
to
propose
that
his
majesty
should
sleep--
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
require
a
state
-
bed
,
"
interrupt
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
thoroughly
tired
that
I
can
sleep
soundly
anywhere
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
I
have
the
less
hesitation
in
propose
that
your
majesty
should
sleep
in
the
barn
,
"
say
the
ceremonious
old
Cavalier
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
far
safe
there
than
in
the
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
just
as
comfortable
I
make
no
doubt
,
"
say
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
answer
for
your
majesty
's
safety
there
,
which
I
can
not
do
here
,
"
say
Mr.
Woolfe
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
just
possible
that
some
of
the
officer
of
the
militia
rebel
may
quarter
in
the
house
,
as
they
have
do
before
.
<EOS>
in
the
barn
your
majesty
would
not
be
liable
to
a
surprise
.
<EOS>
1
will
keep
all
my
people
away
from
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
--
I
see
,
"
cry
the
king
,
rise
from
the
table
,
and
heave
a
sigh
as
he
gaze
round
the
old
oak
room
,
with
its
dark
wainscot
and
portrait
.
<EOS>
"
take
me
to
the
barn
.
"
 
<EOS>
nothing
but
the
sense
that
he
be
perform
a
great
duty
could
have
compel
the
formal
old
Cavalier
to
act
as
he
do
,
but
he
well
know
how
much
be
at
stake
.
<EOS>
do
great
violence
,
therefore
,
to
his
feeling
,
he
take
the
king
to
a
barn
adjoin
the
mansion
,
where
his
majesty
find
a
very
comfortable
couch
in
a
haymow
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
Penderel
sleep
in
the
barn
.
<EOS>
very
fortunate
be
it
that
the
king
do
not
stay
in
the
house
,
as
it
be
visit
by
a
patrol
of
horse
before
daybreak
.
<EOS>
the
soldier
institute
a
rigorous
search
,
but
find
nothing
to
excite
their
suspicion
depart
.
 
<EOS>
Charles
sleep
soundly
in
the
haymow
,
and
the
day
be
far
advanced
before
Trusty
Dick
think
proper
to
disturb
him
.
<EOS>
as
there
be
no
chance
of
cross
the
Severn
,
and
considerable
risk
even
in
stir
forth
,
the
king
do
not
leave
the
barn
.
<EOS>
Breakfast
be
bring
by
Dick
,
and
while
the
king
be
discuss
it
in
an
out
-
of
-
the

way
corner
,
he
hear
the
barn
door
open
,
and
feel
sure
from
the
sound
that
follow
that
more
than
one
person
have
come
in
.
<EOS>
His
alarm
,
however
,
be
instantly
dispel
on
hear
Mr.
Woolfe
's
voice
,
and
he
immediately
leave
his
retreat
to
meet
the
old
Cavalier
.
<EOS>
with
Mr.
Woolfe
be
a
much
young
individual
,
on
behold
whom
his
majesty
utter
a
joyous
exclamation

<EOS>
"

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
Can

"
 
<EOS>
"
yes

"
<EOS>
He
have
only
just

but
on
learn

nothing
would
content
him

I
must
bring

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
delighted

<EOS>
"
I
owe
my

him

<EOS>
without
Captain

I
may
not

<EOS>
and
as
he
speak
he
extend
his
hand
to
the
young
man
,
who
press
it
fervently
to
his

<EOS>
"
It

I

I
must

the
barn
to
bear
the
king
company
.
<EOS>
though
Captain
Woolfe
be
an
agreeable
companion
,
and
do
his
good
to
amuse
the
king
,
Charles
be
very
glad
when
night
come
on
,
so
that
he
could
shift
his
quarter
with
safety
.
<EOS>
He
sup
with
the
old
Cavalier
and
his
son
,
and
pass
so
pleasant
an
hour
with
them
that
he
be
quite
loth
to
take
his
departure
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
far
from
midnight
when
Charles
take
leave
of
Mr.
Woolfe
and
his
son
.
<EOS>
at
that
moment
the
old
Cavalier
almost
repent
that
he
allow
the
king
to
depart
,
and
make
an
effort
to
detain
him
till
the
morrow
,
but
Captain
Woolfe
think
it
best
that
his
majesty
should
adhere
to
his
plan
.
<EOS>
Father
and
son
conduct
him
across
the
moat
,
and
attend
him
to
the
outer
gate
,
and
Charles
have
take
leave
of
them
there
,
set
out
on
his
journey
with
his
faithful
guide
.
<EOS>
fortunately
,
their
nocturnal
walk
be
unattende
by
any
danger
,
and
the
only
annoyance
they
experience
be
cause
by
have
to
wade
across
the
brook
that
turn
Evelith
Mill
,
but
this
be
a
trifling
matter
,
which
give
the
king
no
concern
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
in
less
than
two
hour
,
as
well
as
they
could
reckon
,
for
neither
of
them
have
a
watch
,
they
reach
Boscobel
Wood
;
but
<EOS>
before
enter
it
Dick
deem
it
prudent
to
call
at
the
cottage
of
his
brother
John
,
which
be
close
at
hand
,
and
ascertain
from
him
that
all
be
safe
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
they
proceed
thither
,
and
Dick
knock
against
the
door
with
his
staff
.
<EOS>
an
upper
window
be
quickly
open
by
John
Penderel
,
and
see
who
they
be
,
he
descend
and
let
them
in
.
<EOS>
His
first
business
be
to
strike
a
light
,
and
as
he
do
so
the
king
discover
a
Cavalier
--
for
such
his
attire
<EOS>
proclaim
him
--
fast
asleep
in
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
stranger
here
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Dick
,
surprised
.
<EOS>
"
why
do
not
you
tell
us
so
,
John
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
gentleman
be
no
stranger
to
his
majesty
,
"
reply
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
just
then
,
the
Cavalier
,
arouse
by
the
light
and
the
voice
,
spring
to
his
foot
,
and
the
king
perceive
it
be
Major
Careless
.
<EOS>
the
unexpected
meeting
be
extremely
agreeable
to
both
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hear
your
majesty
be
go
to
Madeley
,
"
say
Careless
,
after
a
cordial
greeting
have
take
place
between
him
and
the
king
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
feel
sure
you
would
never
be
able
to
cross
the
severn
,
and
I
therefore
think
it
likely
you
would
come
to
Boscobel
.
<EOS>
I
myself
get
as
far
as
Evelith
Mill
,
but
return
yester
morning
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
all
safe
here
?
"
ask
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
my
liege
,
very
much

reverse
I
be
sorry
to
say
,
"
reply
careless

<EOS>
"
patrol
of
the
enemy

the
wood
and
visit
all
the

around

<EOS>
I
have
several
narrow
escape
yesterday
,
and
but
for
honest
John
Penderel
here
should
infallibly
have
be
capture
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
just
as
much
indebted
to
Trusty
Dick
,
"
say
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
without
him
,
I
should
not
be
here
now
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
five
of
us
on
whom
your
majesty
can
rely
,
"
say
John
,
who
be
just
as
stalwart
and
as
honest
-
look
as
his
brother
.
<EOS>
"
if
we
have
not
be
loyal
,
Father
Huddlestone
would
have
make
us
so
.
<EOS>
last
night
,
the
good
priest
go
to
talk
to
our
brother
Humphrey
,
the
miller
of
Boscobel
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
now
put
your
loyalty
to
the
test
,
John
,
"
say
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
majesty
can
not
please
me
better
,
"
be
the
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
go
then
to
Boscobel
House
,
and
satisfy
yourself
that
I
may
safely
proceed
thither
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
do
,
my
liege
,
"
rejoin
John
Penderel
,
evidently
well-
pleased
by
the
order
.
<EOS>
"
as
soon
as
I
have
put
on
my
doublet
,
I
will
set
forth
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
office
be
mine
,
by
right
,
"
observe
Trusty
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
nevertheless
,
I
willingly
resign
it
to
John

"
 
<EOS>
"
judge
by
myself
thou
hast
need
of
rest
,
my
faithful
fellow

"
say
Charles
,
kindly

<EOS>

I
would
fain
spare

vanish
,
but
in
a
minute
or
two
reappear
,
fully
equip
,
and
grasp
a
stout
staff
sally
forth
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
now
about
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
and
feel
much
fatigue
with
his
walk
,
and
uncertain
as
to
the
rest
he
may
obtain
,
Charles
throw
himself
into
the
arm
-
chair
lately
occupy
by
Major
Careless
,
and
almost
instantly
fall
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
Careless
find
another
seat
and
follow
his
majesty
's
example
,
while
Trusty
Dick
have
carefully

into
a
sort
of

before
John

<EOS>
all
the
sleeper

his
knock
at
the
door

<EOS>
He
have
see
a
patrol
of
rebel
in
the
wood
,
but
they
be
come
from
Boscobel
--
not

and
he

and

on
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
there
he
see
Brother
William
,
who
tell
him
they
have

so
his

<EOS>
He

and
guard
by
the
two
stalwart
brother
,
who
would
have
sell
their
life
rather
than
allow

<EOS>
They
make
their
way
through
the
depth
of
the
wood
by
path
only
know
to
the
two
forester
,
and
encounter
nothing
more
dangerous
than
a
squirrel
or
a
thrush
.
 
<EOS>
after
half
an
hour
's
walk
through
the
wood
,
they
come
upon
a
lawn
stud
by

among
which

<EOS>
day

just

and
now
that
they
have
get

of
the
dense

<EOS>
at

<EOS>
He
do
not
require
to
be
tell
that
it
be
Boscobel
House
.
 
<EOS>
how
quiet
,
how
sequester
,
how
beautiful
look
the
old
structure
at
that
early
hour
!
<EOS>
Charles
stand
still
to
gaze
at
it

<EOS>
no

by
the
LORD
of
CHILLINGTON

and
how
it
acquire
its
name
 
towards
the
latter
part
of
Elizabeth
's
reign
,
when
those
who
profess
the
tenet
of
the
Church
of
Rome
be
prevent
by
heavy
penalty
from
perform
the
rite
of
their
religion
,
while
such
as
refuse
to
take
the
oath
of

be
hold
guilty
of
high
treason
,
John
Giffard
,
eleventh
Lord

a

and
a
great
sufferer
from

to
<EOS>
,
determine
to
provide
a
safe
asylum
for
recusant
in
a
secluded
part
of
his
domain
;
and
with
this
view
he
build
a
hunting

lodge
in
the
depth
of
Brewood
Forest
,
which
then
belong
to
him

and
contrive
within
the
lonesome
structure
several
secret

<EOS>
the
situation
be
remarkably
well
choose
.
<EOS>
bury
in
a
wood
,
where
it

hardly
likely
to
be
discover
,
the
hunting
-
lodge
be
place
on
the
exact
boundary
line
between
Shropshire
and
Staffordshire
,
so
that
it
be
difficult
to
say
in
which
county
it
stand
.
<EOS>
the
whole
surround
district
be
cover
with
wood
and
common
--
the
near
habitation
be
the
ruin
monastery
of
White
Ladies
and
Black

.
<EOS>
several
large
tree
have
be
remove
to
make
way
for
the
lodge
and
the
outbuilding
connect
with
it
,
but
it
be
screen
by
majestic
oak
,
which
grow
within
a
few
yard
of
the
gate
.
<EOS>
through
these
tree
enchanting
view
could
be
obtain
of
the

scenery
beyond

of

heath
,
until
the
vast
prospect
be
terminate
by
the
picturesque
Clee

<EOS>
nothing
,
however
,
save
forest
timber
could
be
discern
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
lodge
,
and
from
this
circumstance
it
obtain
its
designation

<EOS>
on

the
building
,
the
Squire

among

"
how

<EOS>
at
the
time
of
our
history
Chillington

almost
entirely

<EOS>
in
this
magnificent
mansion
Queen
Elizabeth
have
be
entertain
in
princely
style
during
one
of
her
progress
by
John
Giffard
;
and
the
house
,
from
its
size
and
situation
,
have
be
once
under
consideration
as
a
suitable
place
of
confinement
for
Mary
,
Queen
of
Scots
.
<EOS>
Its
hospitality
be
now
at
an
end
--
its
hall
desolate
.
<EOS>
when
the
unfortunate
Peter
Giffard
be
deprive
of
his
abode
,
Chillington
be
convert
into
a
garrison
by
Sir
William
Brereton
,
and
great
damage
do
to
it
by
the
parliamentary
soldier
.
<EOS>
luckily
,
they
could
not
destroy
the
beautiful
avenue
and
the
park
,
though
they
despoil
the
house
and
lay
waste
the
splendid
old
garden
.

Boscobel
,
though
only
two
mile

the
Squire

and
be
consequently
able

the

<EOS>
George

Ladies
,
and
the
other
pursue
their
quiet
avocation
in
the
forest
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
they
enjoy
this
immunity
solely
because
they
do
not

William

<EOS>
the
only
drawback
be
that
the

and
when

<EOS>
how
TRUSTY
DICK
<EOS>
bethought
him
of
the
OAK
 
<EOS>
in
the
hasty
description
of
Boscobel
House
,
previously
give
,
it
be
remark
that
the
most
singular
feature
of
the
edifice
be
a
huge
projecting
chimney
-
stack
.
<EOS>
a
very
extraordinary
chimney
it
be
,
for
it
have
as
many
as
seven
small
window
,
or
aperture
,
within
it
,
place
at
various
height
,
the
two
low
of
the
opening
be
about
eight
or
nine
foot
from
the
ground
.
<EOS>
view
at
the
side
it
could
be
see
that
the
chimney
-
stack
,
which
rise
considerably
above
the
roof
form
part
of
a
project
wing
of
the
house
,
and
that
there
must
be
something
peculiar
in
the
construction
of
the
funnel
.
<EOS>
altogether
it
have
a
strange
,
mysterious
look
,
and
suggest
the
idea
that
the
builder
must
have
be
slightly
craze
.
<EOS>
yet
,
odd
as
it
be
,
the
huge
,
heavy
,
fantastic
chimney
harmonise
with
the
rest
of
the
structure
.
<EOS>
the
reader
will
have
already
surmise
that
within
this
chimney
-
stack
a
secret
hiding
-
place
exist
;
the
entrance
to
it
be
from
a
closet
connect
with
a
bedroom
on
the
first
floor
--
as
will
be
more
particularly
describe
hereafter
--
while
there
be
an
outlet
into
the
garden
through
a
little
postern
,
completely
screen
by
ivy
.
 
<EOS>
since
the
king
's
arrival
at
Boscobel
,
the
chimney
-
stack
have
acquire
a
new
interest
in
Trusty
Dick
's
eye
,
and
be
now
leave
in
the
garden
to
keep
watch
,
he
scrutinise
it
with
an
anxiety
such
as
he
have
never
heretofore
feel
,
peer
up
at
the
narrow
slit
of
window
,
and
stoop
down
to
ascertain
that
the
postern
be
completely
hide
by
the
ivy
.
 
<EOS>
never
before
have
he
doubt
the
security
of
the
hiding
-
place
,
but
misgiving
now
come
over
him
.
<EOS>
what
if
a
careful
examination
of
the
chimney
,
outside
and
inside
,
should
be
make
while
the
king
be
conceal
therein
?
<EOS>
Discovery
would
then
be
inevitable
.
<EOS>
ponder
upon
the
matter
,
Dick
quit
the
garden
,
and
in
another
instant
be
among
the
noble
old
tree
grow
near
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
an
idea
have
take
possession
of
him
,
and
he
walk
on
till
he
reach
a
giant
oak
which
,
stand
a
little
clear
of
its
fellow
,
be
able
to
spread
abroad
its
mighty
arm
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
tree
he
seek
.
<EOS>
though
it
must
have
be
century
old
,
the
oak
seem
in
full
vigour
,
and
have
suffer
very
little
from
decay
.
<EOS>
Its
trunk
be
enormous
.
<EOS>
It
have
not
,
however
,
grow
to
a
great
height
,
but
have
spread
laterally
.
<EOS>
Dick
examine
this
ancient
oak
very
carefully
--
walk
slowly
round
it--
look
up
at
the
bushy
central
branch
,
and
seem
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
scrutiny
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
the
tree
for
the
king
to
hide
in
!
"
<EOS>
he
mentally
ejaculate
;
"
this
be
the
tree!--the
good
in
the
whole
forest
.
<EOS>
no
one
could
discover
him
among
those
thick
branch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
be
still
examine
the
oak
when
he
be
rouse
by
Major
Careless
,
who
have
be
search
for
him
,
and
have
find
him
,
call
out
,
"
<EOS>
what
ho
!
<EOS>
Dick
--
have
you
desert
your
post
?
"
 
<EOS>
Dick
explain
the
object
that
have
bring
him
thith
,
and
when
he
conclude
,
Careless
say
,
"
You
be
right
,
Dick
.
<EOS>
in
that
oak
our
royal
master
will
be
safe
from
his
enemy
.
<EOS>
I
will
bear
him
company
while
he
hide
within
the
tree
.
<EOS>
but
I
must
look
at
it
more
closely
.
"
 
<EOS>
not
content
with
inspect
the
tree
,
Careless
determine
to
test
its
efficiency
as
a
place
of
concealment
,
and
with
his
companion
's
aid
,
he
therefore
climb
up
into
it
,
and
conceal
himself
among
the
small
branch
.
 
<EOS>
"
Canst
see
me
now
,
Dick
?
"
he
call
out
.
 
<EOS>
"

a
bit

"
rejoin
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
never
guess
your
honour
be
up
there
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
assurance
be
quite
enough
for
Careless
,
and
he
quickly
descend
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
hast
make
a
most
lucky
discovery
,
Dick
,
"
he
cry
.
"
<EOS>
'
tis

<EOS>
His

will
be
as
comfortable
amid
its
branch
as
if
seat
in
an
arm

chair

<EOS>
I
will
tell

so

"
 
<EOS>
while
return
to

they
catch

of
two

through
the

hold
out
longer

be
suffer
rather
sharply

few
hour

Charles
begin
to
feel
extremely
drowsy

at
length
,
be
quite
unable
to
resist
the
strong
inclination
to
slumber
,
he
recline
his
head
on
Careless
's
lap
,
and
almost
instantly
drop
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
the
chief
anxiety
of
the
faithful
attendant
be
to
prevent
his
royal
master
from
fall
,
but
there
be
little
chance
of
such
an
accident
,
for
the
king
never
move
.
<EOS>
the
real
risk
be
lest
Careless
himself
should
follow
his
majesty
's
example
,
for
he
be
oppress
by
drowsiness
in
an
equal
degree
,
but
by
a
great
effort
he
conquer
the
feeling
.

thus
thing
continue
for
some
time

during
which
Careless
never
alter
his
position
for
fear
of
disturb
the
slumber
monarch
.
<EOS>
but
Charles
be
not
easily
awaken
,
as
will
presently
appear
.
 
<EOS>
on
a
sudden
,
Careless
be
rouse
from
the
dreamy
state
of
mind
in
which
he
be
lose
by
a
cry
for
help
,
and
as
he
happen
to
be
think
of
Jasper
at
the
moment
,
he
naturally
conclude
that
the
cry
must
proceed
from
the
page
.
 
<EOS>
in
another
moment
he
become
convinced
that
his
supposition
be
correct
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
the
first
time
he
have
hear
that
voice
in
distress
,
though
under
far
different
circumstance
from
the
present
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
look
out
from
his
place
of
concealment
to
ascertain
the
cause
of
the
outcry
,
but
it
seem
to
him
that
the
luckless
page
be
fly
from
a
patrol
,
and
in
imminent
danger
of
be
capture
.
<EOS>
have
it
be
possible
he
would
have
fly
to
the
youth
's
assistance
,
but
he
could
not
quit
his
position
.
<EOS>
His
anxiety
almost
amount
to
torture
,
but
he
be
oblige
to
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
Charles
sleep
on
soundly
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
listen
<EOS>
intently
,
Careless
hear
the
shout
of
the
trooper
as
they
gallop
among
the
tree
,
and
he
again
hear
Jasper
's
voice
,
but
faint
and
far
off
.
<EOS>
then
it
cease
altogether
.
<EOS>
be
the
fugitive
capture
?
<EOS>
as
Careless
could
still
hear
the
fierce
shout
of
the
pursuer
he
hope
not
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
leave
in
a
state
of
agonising
suspense
,
for
very
soon
the
shout
of
the
trooper
cease
also
.
 
<EOS>
still
the
king
move
not
,
but
continue
bury
in
sleep
for
some
time
longer
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
rouse
himself
,
but
it
take
him
some
minute
to
completely
shake
off
his
lethargy
.

this

become

look
show
so
plainly
that
he
would
execute
his
threat

that
Madmannah
do
not
dare
to
disobey

prudently
hold
his
tongue

see
how
matter
stand
,
and
fearing
lest
the
trooper
may
free
himself
sufficiently
from

draw

descend

there

<EOS>
Careless

he
give
himself
no

follow
Father

down

luckily

there

not

who
be

injunction

<EOS>
but
once
in

hole
,
he
find
it
impossible
to
get
out
,
and
have
to
take
off

could
be
extricate

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
His
investigation
be

by
the
discovery
of

little
altar
in

and
offend
by
the
sight
of
it

he
cause

to
be

<EOS>
after
this
,
he
again
try
the
effect
of
menace
upon
William
Penderel
,
but
find
the
stout
forester
as
stubborn

<EOS>
nothing

<EOS>
at

long
and
fruitless

,
the
baffle

<EOS>
He
have
hear
the
footstep
of

have
he
not

now
that
the
danger

but
though
he
make
light
of
his

he
do
not
underrate
the
risk
incur
on

resolve
,
if

have
be

to

or

Armed
with

near
the
house

but
as
the
man
come
forth
without
their
prey
,
and
have
evidently
fail
in
their
design
,
the
devoted
little
band
separate
,
and
each
man
hurry
back
to
his
abode
--
George
to
White
Ladies
,
John
to
his
little

,
Humphrey
to

Yates
to
his

unspoile
,
and
if
his
high
quality
have
be
call
into
play
,
and
his
unquestionable
military
genius
fully
develop
,
he
may
have
prove
himself
worthy
of
his
grandsire
,
on
his
mother
's
side
,
the
great
Henry
the
Fourth
of
France
.
 
<EOS>
above
all
,
his
heart
be
uncorrupted
and
his
kindly
disposition
have
not
harden
into
selfishness
.
<EOS>
His
natural
gaiety
never
desert
him
,
and
his
constitutional
indifference
to
danger
sustain
him
under
the
most
try
circumstance
.
<EOS>
possible
peril
be
never
allow
to
weigh
upon
his
mind
,
and
in
thus
act
he
show
true
philosophy
.
<EOS>
His
unconcern
astonish
all
who
come
near
him
,
and
Joan
and
her
husband
could
not
sufficiently
admire
his
liveliness
of
manner
.
<EOS>
whether
he
be
quite
so
free
from
anxiety
as
he
appear
may
be
question
,
but
at
any
rate
he
wear
a
very
pleasant
mask
.
 
<EOS>
to
such
a
point
do
he
carry
his
rashness
,
that
at
the
risk
of
be
see
by
an
enemy
on
the
watch
,
he
stroll
forth
into
the
garden
,
and
sit
for
some
time
in
the
little
arbour
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
it
grow
dusk
,
and
they
could
steal
through
the
forest
unperceive
,
the
king
's
promise
escort
begin
to
appear
;
each
stout
fellow
be
arm
with
pike
or
bill
,
as
he
have
be
in
the
morning
,
when
the
brave
little
band
have
resolve
to
effect
Charles
's
rescue
.
 
<EOS>
first
to
arrive
be
James
Yates
,
who
have
marry
a
sister
of
the
Penderels
.
<EOS>
the
king
have
see
him
before
,
as
he
have
serve
under
Charles
Giffard
,
at
Worcester
,
and
have
guide
the
royal
fugitive
to
White
Ladies
.
<EOS>
James
Yates
be
stoutly
make
,
and
have
a
soldier
-
like
bearing
,
but
he
be
not
so
largely
proportion
as
his
brother
-
in-
law
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
be
as
loyal
as
they
be
,
and
just
as
ready
to
shed
his
blood
in
the
good
cause
.
<EOS>
We
grieve
to
say
that
he
suffer
for
his
loyalty
,
be
execute
at
a
subsequent
date
at
Chester
.
<EOS>
Charles
be
very
glad
to
see
him
,
and
possibly
the
gracious
word
then
address
to
him
by
the
king
may
have
cheer
the
brave
fellow
's
late
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Ere
long
the
other
arrive
,
and
now
that
they
be
all
assemble
,
armed
and
accoutre
in
the
good
way
they
could
,
Charles
think
he
have
never
see
a
fine
set
of
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
with
such
a
body
-
guard
I
shall
not
fear
the
enemy
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
majesty
shall
not
be
take
,
while
we
can
defend
you
,
"
they
cry
with
one
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
have
bring
your
horse
for
me
,
Humphrey
?
"
say
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
sire

"
reply
the
sturdy
miller

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Robin
be
already
in
the
barn
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
well
!
"
cry
Charles
.
"
<EOS>
now
sit
down
to
supper
,
and
mind
me
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
king
have
already
sup
,
and
sup
very
heartily
,
for
his
misfortune
have
not
take
away
his
appetite
,
but
his
majesty
eat
little
in
comparison
with
those
who
follow
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
wonderful
to
see
how
quickly
the
heap
up
trencher
be
clear
,
and
how
soon
the
tall
tankard
of
ale
be
empty
.
<EOS>
but
the
trencher
be
fill
again
,
and
so
be
the
tall
tankard
,
though
only
to
be
empty
once
more
.
<EOS>
luckily
,
there
be
enough
and
to
spare
,
for
Joan
know
the
power
of
her
guest
,
and
have
provide
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
plain
but
plentiful
repast
be
end
,
and
the
horn
cup
be
fill
for
the
last
time
,
the
stalwart
brethren
arise
,
and
drink
the
king
's
health
and
confusion
to
his
enemy
;
after
which
,
William
Penderel
ask
pardon
for
the
freedom
they
have
take
,
and
declare
the
impulse
be
uncontrollable
,
add
that
whenever
it
please
his
majesty
to
set
forth
they
be
ready
to
attend
him
.
 
<EOS>
Charles
sigh
,
for
he
be
unwilling
to
depart
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
there
be
no
help
.
<EOS>
so
he
take
leave
of
Dame
Joan
,
express
his
deep
sense
of
the
great
service
she
and
her
husband
have
render
him
,
and
promise
to
reward
them
adequately
,
if
he
should
ever
be
able
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
every
belief
that
a
time
will
come
,
when
I
shall
be
able
to
prove
my
gratitude
to
you
,
my
good

and
to
your
worthy
<EOS>
husband--
<EOS>
indeed
,
to
all
my

"
 
<EOS>
"
We
want
no

my

"
say
William
Penderel
.
<EOS>
"
what
we

the
profound
obeisance
she

<EOS>
"
We
shall
meet
again
in
happy

"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
quit
the
house
by
the
back
door
,
follow
by
William
Penderel
and
his
sturdy
brother
and
brother

<EOS>
the
miller
's
horse
--
a
short
,
well
set
,
strong
animal
,
which
in
these
day
would
be
describe
as
a
stout
cob
--
be
bring
out
of
the
barn
by
his
master
,
who
hold
the
bridle
while
the
king
mount
.
 
<EOS>
Meantime
,
Joan
have
come
forth
with
a
lantern
,
and
its
light
show
a
curious
scene
--
all
the
stalwart
brother
,
arm
with
their
bill
and
pike
,
group
around
the
king
,
who
be
now
in
the
saddle
--
while
William
Penderel
be
arrange
the
order
of
march
.
 
<EOS>
with
the
king
's
approval
,
it
be
settle
that
Humphrey
and
John
should
form
the
advanced
guard
,
while
the
rear
should
be
bring
up
by
George
Penderel
and
Francis
Yates
.
<EOS>
William
and
Trusty
Dick
be
to
march
on
either
side
of
his
majesty
,
who
be
well
pleased
to
have
their
companionship
,
as
they
be
his
favourite
.
<EOS>
till
this
moment
Charles
have
not
form
an
exact
notion
of
William
Penderel
's
height
,
and
he
be
surprised
to
find
that
the
gigantic
forester
stand
on
a
level
with
him
,
though
he
himself
be
seat
on
the
mill
-
horse
.
 
<EOS>
before
the
little
band
get
into
the
order
of
march
,
William
Penderel
say
to
his
brother
,
in
deep
impressive
accent
which
vibrate
through
the
king
's
breast
,
and
move
him
greatly
:
 
<EOS>
"
His
majesty
need
no
assurance
of
our
fidelity
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
since
he
have
deign
to
choose
us
as
his
guard
,
let
us
swear
by
all
we
hold
sacred
to
defend
him
to
the
last
,
and
against
all
odd
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
swear
it
,
"
cry
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
die
before
harm
shall
befal
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
Charles
thank
them
earnestly
for
their
zeal
,
add
that
he
well
know
their
oath
would
be
keep
.
 
<EOS>
the
brave
little
band
then
quit
the
yard
in
the
order
prescribe
.
 
<EOS>
Proud
of
the
trust
repose
in
them
,
the
loyal
brother
almost
hope
that
their
fidelity
may
be
prove
.
<EOS>
Woe
to
any
rebel
patrol
that
may
attempt
to
stop
them
!
<EOS>
in
addition
to
their
woodbill
,
William
and
Trusty
Dick
have
each
a
pistol
--
take
from
Madmannah
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
in
their
weapon
,
but
in
their
stout
heart
,
and
strong
thew
and
sinew
,
that
Charles
have
the
great
reliance
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
no
monarch
ever
have
such
an
escort
as
he
now
possess
in
those
hardy
forester
.
 
<EOS>
just
as
Charles
ride
out
of
the
yard
with
a
guard
on
either
side
,
he
see
Dame
Joan
stand
at
the
door
with
the
lantern
in
her
hand
,
strain
her
eye
through
the
gloom
,
and
shout
an
adieu
to
her
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
last
he
beheld
of
the
faithful
creature
.
 
<EOS>
after
pass
some
outbuilding
,
the
party
come
in
front
of
the
house
,
which
present
a
long
irregular
outline
.
<EOS>
the
night
be
not
dark
,
for
the
moon
,
then
in
its
first
quarter
,
have
just
rise
,
and
its
beam
illumine
the
gable
and
black
and
white
chequer
-
work
of
the
old
hunting
-
lodge
.
 
<EOS>
not
without
emotion
do
Charles
contemplate
the
huge
fantastic
chimney
-
stack
,
in
the
recess
of
which
he
have
be
hide
;
while
the
little
arbour
,
which
next
catch
his
eye
,
excite
a
different
kind
of
interest
.
<EOS>
mentally
he
bid
farewell
to
a
spot
which
he
feel
would
always
have
interest
for
him
.
<EOS>
yet
strange
to
say
,
though
he
often
speak
of
Boscobel
in
after
time
,
he
never
revisit
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
take
me
past
the
oak
,
"
he
say
to
Trusty
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
I
desire
to
see
the
tree
once
more
.
"
 
<EOS>
word
to
this
effect
be
give
to
those
in
advance
,
but
they
have
anticipate
his
majesty
's
wish
,
and
intend
to
take
him
past
the
royal
oak
.
 
<EOS>
shortly
afterwards
the
party
halt
beside
the
noble
tree
.
<EOS>
how
beautiful
it
look
at
that
hour
!
<EOS>
its
summit
silver
by
the
moonlight
,
while
a
few
beam
find
their
way
through
opening
in
the
branch
,
and
fall
upon
the
massive
stem
.
<EOS>
Charles
be
enchant
.
 
<EOS>
"
truly
that
be
a
royal
tree
!
"
<EOS>
he
think
.
<EOS>
"
how
majestic
it
look
among
the
oak
that
surround
it
,
though
they
be
all
noble
tree
,
and
how
it
lord
it
over
them
--
like
a
king
among
his
peer
!
"
<EOS>
He
then
add
aloud
to
Trusty
Dick
,
"
but
for
you
,
my
good
friend
,
I
should
not
have
make
acquaintance
with
this
grand
old
tree
,
and
I
should
therefore
have
lose
some
of
the
happy
moment
of
my
life
,
for
though
in
great
jeopardy
,
I
be
never
happy
than
during
my
day
's
sojourn
in
the
oak
;
and
if
I
be
spare
I
shall
ever
look
back
to
the
time
with
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
farewell
,
old
tree
!
"
<EOS>
he
add
.
<EOS>
"
May
I
spend
another
happy
day
amid
thy
friendly
bough
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
move
on
,
and
the
party
take
their
way
through
a
thicket
,
where
the
moon
's
radiance
be
intercept
by
the
branch
overhead
<EOS>
,
it
be
so
dark
that
they
could
not
see
many
yard
before
them
,
and
they
have
to
proceed
with
great
caution
--
the
advanced
guard
halt
ever
and
anon
.
<EOS>
but
nothing
occur
to
cause
them
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
they
reach
an
opening
in
the
wood
,
and
a
broad
moonlit
glade
lie
before
them
,
but
they
hesitate
to
cross
it
,
and
keep
among
the
tree
;
and
the
prudence
of
the
step
be
show
a
few
minute
afterwards
,
when
a
patrol
,
whom
they
must
infallibly
have
encounter
have
they
go
straight
on
,
appear
on
the
lawn
.
 
<EOS>
the
sight
of
the
enemy
arouse
the
choler
of
the
loyal
brother
,
and
Humphrey
express
a
strong
desire
to
give
the
knave
a
drubbing
,
but
,
of
course
,
he
be
not
allow
to
gratify
his
inclination
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
witness
of
the
passage
of
the
king
and
his
companion
through
the
forest
--
but
have
there
be
,
<EOS>
the
sight
would
have
be
worth
view
.
<EOS>
those
dark
gigantic
figure
indistinctly
see
among
the
tree
look
strange
and
mysterious
.
<EOS>
and
when
the
party
issue
forth
into
some
more
open
spot
not
overhang
by
bough
,
so
that
the
moonlight
fall
upon
them
and
cast
their
black
shadow
on
the
ground
,
they
look
still
more
unearthly
.
<EOS>
despite
the
peril
to
which
he
be
expose
,
and
the
many
difficulty
and
hindrance
he
have
to
undergo
,
the
king
enjoy
the
ride
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
enjoy
it
still
more
if
the
horse
he
bestrode
have
be
less
rough
of
motion
.
<EOS>
but
his
majesty
's
seat
in
the
saddle
be
far
from
easy
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
he
lose
all
patience
,
and
exclaim
:
 
"
Plague
take
thy
horse
,
Humphrey
!
<EOS>
never
before
be
I
so
jolted
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
his
good
humour
be
instantly
restore
by
the
miller
's
ready
response
.
 
<EOS>
"
generally
,
Robin
go
well
enough
,
"
say
Humphrey
.
<EOS>
"
but
your
majesty
must
consider
that
he
have
now
get
the
weight
of
three
kingdom
on
his
back

<EOS>
Charles
laugh
,
and
make
no
further
complaint

<EOS>
where
the
king
find
jasper
 
not
long
afterwards
,
they
reach
Chillington
Park
,
but
they
do
not
enter
it
as
Father
Huddlestone
and
his
companion
have
do
by
the
avenue
gate
,
but
at
the
back
of
the
hall
where
the
wood
be
thickest
.
 
<EOS>
this
part
of
the
park
be
overrun
with
bush
,
and
it
be
here
,
in
Rock

Coppice
,
as
it
be
call
,
that
the
dry
pit
be
situate
to
which

have
be
bring
.
<EOS>
They
force
their
way
,
not
without
some
difficulty
,
through
this
broad
barrier
of
brushwood
,
and
then
a
most
charming
scene
burst
upon
them
for
which
the
king
be
not
at
all
prepared
--
have
hear
no
description
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
bottom
of
a
long
and
deep
valley
,
which
constitute
the
most
beautiful
feature
of
the
park
,
be
several
large

.
<EOS>
in
later
time
these
pool
have
be
throw
together
so
as
to
form

extensive
lake
,
which
have
be
further
embellish
with
a
bridge
,

,
and

at
the
period

the

an
air

the

<EOS>
Charles
first
beheld
this
exquisite
scene
from
an
elevation
command
the
whole
length
of
the
valley
,
and
the
numerous
sheet
of
water
fringe
by
tree
and
glitter
in
the
moonlight
produce
a
truly
magical
effect
,
that
fill
him
with
rapture
.
 
<EOS>
He
halt
for
a
short
time
to
gaze
at
it
,
and
while
his
eye
wander
over
the
pool
immediately
beneath
him
he
fancy
he
descry
a
boat
steal
along
under
the
shadow
of
the
tree
on
the
further
side
of

pool
,
and
point
out
the

Major
Careless

Huddlestone
have
leave
me

your

shall
hear
what
have
happen
.
<EOS>
have
be
tell
that
Colonel
James
and
his
trooper
have
leave
Chillington
House
,
we
be
foolish
enough
to
go
thither
,

find
it
in
a
terrible
state
,
everything
knock
to
piece
by
the
rebel
soldier
.
<EOS>
while
Major
Careless
and
the
priest
go
up

stair
to
see
what
further
damage
have
be
do
,
I
remain
below
,

be
tired
,
presently
fall
asleep
on
a
bench
in
the
hall

<EOS>
"
I
be
awaken
by
a
great
noise
in

of

house
,
and
your
majesty
may
conceive
my
fright
when
I
find
that
a
small
detachment
of
trooper
have
just
arrive
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
,
I
hear
Major
Careless
call
me
,
and
not
know
what
to
do
run
up
the
great
staircase
,
but
could
find
no
one
.
<EOS>
listening
,
I
hear
that
the
trooper
have
come
in
,
so
I
do
not
dare
to
go
down
,
but
hide
myself
in
a
closet
,
and
do
not
quit
it
for
some
time
,
when
find
all
quiet
,
I
steal
forth
,
and
descend
by
a
back
staircase
.
<EOS>
but
this
very
nearly
lead
to
my
capture
,
for
some
of
the
trooper
be
in
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
fortunately
,
they
be
eat
and
drink
at
the
time
,
and
do
not
perceive
me
,
so
I
hastily
retreat
and
go
upstairs
again
as
quietly
as
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
"
after
this
narrow
escape
I
do
not
dare
to
make
another
attempt
at
flight
,
but
wander
about
among
the
desert
room
during
the
rest
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
though
I
be
tired
to
death
of
my
confinement
,
I
be
not
trouble
by
the
trooper

for
none

come
up

stair

though
I
could
hear
them
move
about
below

at
length

to
my
great
delight

it
begin
to
grow
dark

I
hope
my
hour
of
deliverance
be
at
hand

<EOS>
take
every
precaution

I
once
more
descend
the
back
staircase

approach
the
kitchen

<EOS>
no
one
be
there

<EOS>
but
the
trooper
have
only
just
leave
,
for
I
hear
them
ride
out
of
the
court
-
yard
.
<EOS>
on
the
table
be
the
remain
of
their
repast
,
and
your
majesty
will
not
wonder
that
I
pick
up
all
the
fragment
I
could
find
when
you
consider
that
I
have
eat
nothing
since
I
leave
Boscobel
in
the
morning

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>

no

indeed
,
my
liege
,
I
get
quite
enough
,
and
have
satisfied
my
appetite
,
I
quit
the
house
at
the
back
,
and
very
soon
gain
the
park
.
<EOS>
be
totally
unacquainted
with
the
place
I
know
not
which
way
to
shape
my
course

be
afraid
of
lose
myself
,
but
I
have
hear
Father
Huddlestone
say
that
your
majesty
and
your
escort
would
be
sure
to
pass
through
this
part
of
the
park

I
determine
to
hook
out
for
you

"
when
I
leave
Chillington
House
it
be
almost
dark
,

the
moon
have
now
rise
,
and
reveal
all
the
beauty
of
the
scene

<EOS>
I
wander
on
insensibly
till
I
come
to
this
valley

when
my
further
progress
be
check
by
the
pool

I
should
have
turn
back

I
not
discover
a

moor
to

bank

I
immediately
avail
myself
of
this
mode

crossing

I
have
only
just
get
into
the
boat
and
begin
to
use
the
oar
,
when
I
hear
sound
on
the
opposite
bank

convince
me
some
person
be
there

I
hope
it
may
be
your

your
attendant

not

quite
sure

I
think
it
best
to
keep
in

shade

I
may
be
catch
in

trap

Your

exit

Codsall

they
proceed
in

forth
on

the
night

however

be
much
too
bright

fine

who
would
have
prefer
a
sky
cover
with
heavy
black
cloud
,
and
not
a

visible

<EOS>
They
consult
together
for
a
few
moment
in
a
low
tone
,
but
do
not
communicate
their
fear
to
the
king
.

"

off

be

charming

picturesque
black

white

that
date
back
to
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
,
when
our
old
english

the
eye
with
its
irregular
frontage
,
its
numerous
gable

bay

huge
stack

<EOS>
even
now
there

about
Moseley

but
at
the
period
of
which
we

it
be
almost
surround
by

and
though
there

much
near

it

a
look
of
extreme
privacy

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
indeed

it

--
perhaps
to

secret
chamber
,
and
secret
closet
.
 
<EOS>
these
rumour
be
not
altogether
unfounded
.
<EOS>
like
their
friend
and
neighbour
the
Giffards
,
the
whitgreave
have
adhere
firmly
to
the
old
religion
,
and
,
like
them
,
have
find
it
necessary
to
contrive
hiding-
place
for
priest
and
recusant
.
<EOS>
many
such
exist
at
Moseley
Old
Hall
,
and
some
be
still
extant
.
 
<EOS>
Descended
from
an
ancient
Staffordshire
family
,
who
have
dwell
at
Burton
,
Thomas
Whitgreave
,
owner
of
Moseley
Old
Hall
,
in
1651
,
have
serve
during
the
early
part
of
the
Civil
Wars
under
Captain
Thomas
Giffard
,
and
have
distinguish
himself
for
his
bravery
;
but
have
receive
a
severe
wound
,
from
which
he
be
some
time
in
recovering
,
he
retire
to
his
old
family
mansion
,
and
take
no
further
part
in
the
struggle
.
<EOS>
still
,
his
zeal
for
the
cause
of
monarchy
be
ardent
as
ever
,
and
his
sympathy
be
entirely
for
the
young
king
,
he
be
deeply
afflict
by
the
disastrous
result
of
the
Battle
of
Worcester
.
 
<EOS>
Thomas
Whitgreave
be
still
young
--
at
all
event
,
he
be
not
more
than
thirty
-
five
--
<EOS>
tall
,
and
handsome
,
with
a
grave
but
kindly
expression
of
countenance
.
<EOS>
at
the
time
he
receive
the
king
,
he
be
unmarried
,
but
his
mother
,
a
remarkable
old
lady
,
reside
with
him
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Whitgreave
be
as
staunch
a
Royalist
as
her
son
,
and
daily
invoke
Heaven
's
vengeance
upon
the
regicide
Cromwell
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Whitgreave
keep
up
a
good
establishment
,
though
not
a
large
retinue
of
servant
.
<EOS>
His
domestic
chaplain
be
Father
Huddlestone
,
and
he
behave
with
the
great
consideration
to
the
good
priest
,
not
only
assign
him
room
for
study
and
devotion
,
but
allow
him
to
take
,
a
couple
of
pupil
.
<EOS>
Father
Huddlestone
be
very
useful
in
the
house
,
and
,
without
be
meddlesome
,
exercise
a
beneficial
influence
over
the
family
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Whitgreave
be
a
devotee
,
and
as
scrupulous
in
the
performance
of
her
religious
duty
as
if
she
have
belong
to
a
convent
.
<EOS>
a
chaplain
,
therefore
,
be
a
necessity
to
her
,
and
no
one
could
have
better
discharge
the
sacred
office
than
Father
Huddlestone
.
<EOS>
not
only
do
the
good
priest
improve
the
household
by
his
council
,
but
his
society
be
extremely
agreeable
to
the
master
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
such
be
the
constitution
of
Moseley
Old
Hall
at
the
time
when
the
fugitive
king
be
receive
within
it
.
 
<EOS>
among
the
roman
catholic
gentry
of
the
period
,
all
of
whom
be
Royalists
,
there
be
necessarily
a
good
deal
of
private
communication
,
conduct
chiefly
through
the
medium
of
the

.
<EOS>
thus
secret
intelligence
be
convey

Father
Huddlestone
of

it
be
through
Father
Huddlestone
that
John
Penderel
be
enable
to
secure
a
place
of
refuge
for
Lord
Wilmot

<EOS>
It
be
from
the
same
quarter
that
the
fugitive
king
's
movement
be
first
make
known
to
the
good

his

<EOS>
every

Old

They
then
march
quickly

<EOS>
"

for

with

the

so
after

We

I

fully
sensible
of

<EOS>
and

stretch
out
his

the
stalwart

their

Whitgreave

"
<EOS>
and
I
will
attend
to
them
myself

as
I
must

do

that
all

abed

conduct
your

"
 
<EOS>
bestow
a
last
look
at
the
three
stalwart
brother
,
who
seem
greatly
deject
,
Charles
,
accompany
by
Careless
,
follow
Father
Huddlestone
to
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
enter
at
the
rear
of
the
mansion
,
Father
Huddlestone
take
the
king
and
Careless
up
a
back
staircase
with
cautious
step
,
and
as
they
near
the
summit
they
perceive
a
dark
figure
retreat
noiselessly
down
a
passage
.
 
<EOS>
Aware
that
this
be
Lord
Wilmot
<EOS>
,
Charles
keep
silence
till
he
have
enter
his
lordship
's
room
,
which
be
situate
at
the
end
of
the
passage
,
and
he
then
give
utterance
to
his
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Wilmot
,
as
the
reader
be
aware
,
be
a
special
favourite
of
the
king
,
and
his
majesty
have
more
dependence
upon
him
than
upon
any
one
else
,
save
Careless
.
<EOS>
Lord
Wilmot
must
not
be
confound
with
his
son
,
the
dissolute
Earl
of
Rochester
,
who
figure
some
year
afterwards
at
the
court
of
the
Merry
Monarch
.
<EOS>
a
brave
,
chivalrous
nobleman
,
he
be
able
to
act
as
a
sort
of
mentor
to
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Wilmot
have
,
in
fact
,
belong
to
the
court
of
Charles
I.
,
and
have
acquire
the
grave
manner
of
that
period
.
<EOS>
tall
and
strongly
build
,
he
have
handsome
,
expressive
feature
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
as
be
well
known
,
could
successfully
counterfeit
any
part
he
please
,
but
he
do
not
inherit
his
talent
any
more
than
his
vice
from
his
father
,
who
could
never
be
prevail
upon
to
assume
a
disguise
,
declare
that
,
if
he
do
so
,
he
should
infallibly
be
find
out
.
 
<EOS>
see
that
the
king
look
much
fatigue
with
his
journey
,
Lord
Wilmot
beseech
him
to
postpone
all
conversation
till
he
have
take
some
refreshment
,
and
open
a
cupboard
his
lordship
produce
some
cake
and
a
flask
of
canary
.
 
<EOS>
Charles
sit
down
,
and
empty
a
goblet
of
generous
wine
,
insist
upon
all
the
other
follow
his
example

and
while
they
be
do
so
<EOS>
a
gentle
tap
be
hear
at
the
door

which
be
open
by
Father
Huddlestone

and
Mr.

in

"

the

<EOS>
"
They

go

my

reply
Whitgreave

"
<EOS>
and
I
must
say
that
I
never
see
man
more
grieve
to
part

these
loyal-
hearted
fellow

<EOS>

say
you
sooth

"
cry
Charles

<EOS>
"
Your

shall
judge

"
reply
Whitgreave
.
<EOS>
"
I
take
them
to
the
buttery
,
where
I
have
often
see
each
and
<EOS>
all
of
them
make
a
hearty
meal
,
and
where
there
be
plenty
of
cold
meat
,
and
bade
them
<EOS>
fall
to
and
spare
not
.
<EOS>
They
decline
.
<EOS>
and
when
I
press
them
further
,
say
they
would
discredit
my
house
if
they
go
away
without
supper
,
they
say
they
have
no
appetite
.
'
<EOS>
no
appetite
!
'
<EOS>
I
exclaim
.
'
<EOS>
how
be
this
?
'
<EOS>
but
I
soon
find
out
what
be
the
matter
.
<EOS>
each
honest
heart
be
full
,
and
want
relief
.
<EOS>
a
single
morsel
of
meat
would
have
choke
any
one
of
them

<EOS>
however
,
they
drink
a
cup
of
ale
to
your
majesty
's
health

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
they
be
go
?
"
cry
Charles

<EOS>
"
I
should
have
like
to
see
their
honest
face
once
more
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
majesty
know
where
to
find
them
<EOS>
should
you
again
require
their
service
,
"
say
Mr.
Whitgreave
.
<EOS>
"
and
I
be
sure
nothing
will
delight
them
more
than
to
have
another
opportunity
of
prove
their
fidelity
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
circumstance
,
as
will
be
see
as
we
proceed
with
our
narrative
,
do
not
allow
Charles
to
employ
any
one
of
the
stalwart
brother
again
.
 
<EOS>
Their
part
in
our
story
be
play
.
<EOS>
yet
before
dismiss
them
,
we
would
express
our
genuine
admiration
of
the
loyal
man
we
have
endeavour
to
depict
.
<EOS>
in
describe
them
we
have
not
go
beyond
the
truth
;
nor
endow
them
with
heroic
quality
they
do
not
possess
.
<EOS>
the
Penderel
brother
be
man
of
unwavering
loyalty
,
brave
as
faithful
,
and
possess
of
such
extraordinary
strength
as
render
them
truly
formidable
antagonist
.
<EOS>
fortunately
,
they
be
not
call
upon
to
display
their
valour
in
action
.
<EOS>
have
they
be
require
to
defend
the
king
from
an
attack
during
the
nocturnal
ride
from
Boscobel
to
Moseley
Old
Hall
,
which
we
have
just
describe
,
it
be
certain
they
would
have
do
tremendous
execution
upon
his
foe
,
and
have
deliver
him
,
or
die
in
his
defence
.
<EOS>
that
their
loyal
heart
could
not
harbour
a
thought
of
treason
,
or
quail
before
peril
,
we
have
show
.
<EOS>
Their
devotion
to
the
fugitive
monarch
,
and
the
important
service
they
render
him
in
his
hour
of
need
,
have
gain
them
a
page
in
England
's
history
.
<EOS>
very
pleasant
have
it
be
to
chronicle
their
action
,
and
we
part
from
them
with
regret

with

it

Mr.

more

that

have
a
comrade
with

the

being
on

with

even
at

It

like

seem
ever
on

may
hunt
him
down
at
last

for

shake
him

at
this

,
the
governor
of
Stafford
Castle
,
intend
to
search
this
house
to
-
morrow
,
and
to
bring
Southall
,
the
redoubte
priest
-
catcher
,
with
him
.
<EOS>
It
seem
quite
certain
that
,
in
some
way
or
other
,
the
king
have
be
track
to
Moseley
Hall
,
and
I
be
therefore
of
opinion
that
he
ought
to
change
his
quarter
without
delay
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
that
even
Southall
will
discover
the
hiding
-
place
in
my
house
,
"
rejoin
Whitgreave
.
"
<EOS>
still
,
the
king
ought
not
to
be
expose
to
any
risk
that
can
be
avoid
;
and
if
you
be
prepared
to
receive
him
at
Bentley
House
,
I
think
he
have
best
go
there
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
at
all
event
,
after
what
you
tell
me
of
Captain
Stone
's
threaten
visit
,
I
should
not
dare
to
oppose
the
plan
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Whitgreave
then
return
to
the
house
,
and
tell
the
king
what
he
have
see
and
hear
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
two
faithful
adherent
be
wait
to
take
you
hence
,
sire
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
Colonel
Lane
affirm
,
"
he
add
,
with
a
sigh
,
"
that
my
house
be
no
longer
a
safe
place
of
refuge
for
your
majesty
,
and
though
I
can
not
agree
with
him
,
I
will
not
urge
you
to
stay
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
expect
this
sudden
summon
<EOS>
,
I
confess
,
Mr.
Whitgreave
,
"
rejoin
the
king
;
"
and
I
need
not
say
it
be
far
from
agreeable
to
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
no
option
.
<EOS>
from
the
appearance
of
those
two
spy
I
be
convinced
that
my
retreat
have
be
discover
,
and
if
Colonel
Lane
have
not
come
for
me
,
I
should
have
deem
it
prudent
to
leave
before
daybreak
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
not
suffer
for
the
devotion
you
have
show
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
shall
ever
remain
your
debtor
.
"
<EOS>
then
,
turn
to
Father
Huddlestone
,
he
add
,
"
it
may
be
enough
for
me
to
tell
you
that
I
shall
always
think
the
well
of
your
religion
since
I
have
see
how
well
you
practise
it

but
when
I
reflect
on
the
many
good
and
faithful
subject
you
have
bring
me
in
these
evil
time
,
when
almost
every
hand
be
raise
against

,
I
feel
that
I
should
be
ungrateful
if
I
do
not
say
how
deeply
I
be
behold
to
you

<EOS>
You
have

I

It
be
possible

Heaven
may
have
further
trial
in
store
for
your

to
which
I
earnestly
exhort
you
to
submit
with
patience

chapter

<EOS>
how
the
king
arrive
at
BENTLEY
HOUSE
 
<EOS>
the
night
be
so
enchanting
,
that
although
the
king
be
not
without
apprehension
of
a
chance
encounter
with
the
enemy
,
he
greatly
enjoy
his
ride
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
he
be
very
well
pleased
with
the
trooper
's
horse
on
which
he
be
mount
.
 
<EOS>
Colonel
Lane
act
as
leader
of
the
party
,
and
take
them
across
a
common
,
now
know
as
Cooke
's
Gorse
,
past
Essington
Mill
,
and
then
over
another
common
to
Allen
's
Rough
.
<EOS>
More
heath
still
lie
before
them
,
and
have
traverse
a
very
wild
district
,
they
reach
an
extensive
coppice
,
which
form
part
of
Colonel
Lane
's
own
estate
.
<EOS>
during
the
whole
ride
,
they
have
scarcely
see
a
habitation
,
and
have
not
encounter
a
single
individual
.
<EOS>
deem
the
danger
over
,
Colonel
Lane
slacken
his
pace
,
and
begin
to
converse
with
the
king
,
tell
his
majesty
that
he
think
his
horse
have
go
remarkably
well
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
too
,
colonel
,
"
reply
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
more
,
I
be
of
opinion
that
this
be
not
the
first
time
I
have
ride
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
sire
!
"
exclaim
Colonel
Lane
,
in
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
unless
I
be
greatly
mistaken
,
this
be
the
very
horse
I
ride
from
Worcester
to
White
Ladies

<EOS>
I
know
his
action

<EOS>
how
say
you

Careless

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
certainly
do
not
occur
to
me
before

my

reply
careless
.
<EOS>
"
but
now
I
look
at
the
horse
more
closely
<EOS>
I
believe
your
majesty
be
right
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
able
to
settle
the
question

Colonel
Lane

"
observe
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
I
give
the
Worcester
horse
to
you
at
White
Ladies

<EOS>
what
become
of
him
afterwards
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
lose
him
in
the
fight
near
Newport
,
where
Lord
Derby
be
worst
by
Lilburn
and
Colonel
James

<EOS>
possibly
he
may
have
fall
into
the
hand
of
one
of
the
trooper

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
so
,
"
exclaim
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
oddsfish
!
'
<EOS>
tis
a
strange
circumstance
.
<EOS>
now
that
I
have
get
the
horse
again
,
I
will
not
part
with
him
if
I
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
doubtless
,
he
be
well
worth
keep
,
"
observe
Careless
;
"

he
may
be
recognise
by
the
rascally
trooper

and
the
discovery
would
endanger
your

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
risk
be
so
slight
that
I
shall
not
heed
it
,
"
say
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
pass
through
the
coppice
they
soon
afterwards
enter
a
park
,
in
the
midst
of
which
stand
Bentley
House
.
 
<EOS>
this
fine
old
mansion
have
be
since
pull
down
,
and
replace
by
a
modern
structure
,
which
,
though
handsome
and
commodious
,
do
not
of
course
possess
the
historic
interest
of
the
early
building

its
ornamented
gable
,
projection

and
large
window

Bentley

it

forth
from

whatever

no

suspicion

at

whereupon
Colonel
Lane
,
with
a
thousand
apology

take
him
to
a
small
chamber
at
the
top
of

<EOS>
small
as

gloomy
look

despite

dryly

Methinks

,
"
remark
Jane
,
in
a
low
voice

at
this
moment

,
and
say
:
 
"
pray
do
not
wait
for
us
.
<EOS>
We
shall
come

slowly
,
for
we

and
we

plenty
of
partridge

the

We

"
 
<EOS>
Colonel

in

<EOS>
"
Should

who

Mr.

and
his
wife
,
ride
on
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Lane
and
his
party
do
not
follow
them
for
some
minute
,
and
by
that
time
those
in
advance
have
nearly
reach

<EOS>
on
gain
the
high

Darlaston
and
Wednesbury
,
the
horseman
proceed
side
by
side
,
in
order
that
the
lady
may
converse
together
,
and
Jane
do
not
seem
to
feel
the
king
's
presence
as
a
restraint
,
for
she
chat
very
pleasantly
with
her
sister
.
<EOS>
Charles
,
of
course
,
take
no
part
in
the
conversation
,
and
never
speak
unless
address

but
he
be
amuse
by
what
he

<EOS>
Mrs.

talk
about
the
event
at
Worcester
,
and
wish
to
have
a
particular
description
of
the
king

her

<EOS>
"
I
have
already
describe
him
to
you
,
"
say
Jane
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
you
tell
me
he
do
not
realise
the
notion
you
have
form
of
him
;
that
his
manner
be
somewhat
light
and
reckless
;
and
that
he
want
the
gravity
and
dignity
of
his
father
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
misunderstood
me
,
"
observe
Jane
,
uneasily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
say
he
have
many
royal
and
noble
quality
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
you
add
that
he
rarely
display
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
I
say
so
,
I
do
him
an
injustice
.
<EOS>
I
never
think
of
his
majesty--
<EOS>
never
speak
of
him
,
save
with
enthusiasm
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Colonel
Lane
be
equally
enthusiastic
,
"
remark
Mr.
Petre
.
<EOS>
"
in
his
eye
the
king
have
not
a
fault
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
brave
and
chivalrous
monarch
,
"
cry
Jane
,
"
and
deserve
far
great
success
than
he
have
obtain
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
should
know
the
king
be
<EOS>
I
to
see
him
,
"
observe
Mr.
Petre
.
"
<EOS>
Colonel
Lane
have
often
describe
him
to
me
as
tall
and
well-
make
but
harsh
-
featured
,
and
dark
as
a
gipsy
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
that
description
would
exactly
apply
to
Will
Jones
,
"
say
Mrs.
Petre
.
 
<EOS>
"
so
it
would
,
"
remark
her
husband
,
laugh
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
have
pass
through
Wednesbury
,
they
be
now
on
the
road
to
Birmingham
,
but
not
desire
to
enter
the
latter
town
,
they
soon
strike
off
into
a
by
-
road
,
which
lead
them
through
a
very
beautiful
country
,
where
one
large
park
succeed
another
and
the
only
house
that
come
in
sight
be
large
and
important
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
person
who
reside
in
these
old
mansion
be
friend
of
the
Lanes
,
but
Jane
and
her
sister
call
upon
none
of
them
,
but
pursue
their
journey
for
nearly
three
hour
without
halt
of
any
kind
.
 
<EOS>
Hitherto
they
have
encounter
no
obstacle
of
any
kind
,
and
Charles
,
though
he
run
the
great
risk
,
enjoy
the
ride
far
more
than
any
one
else
in
the
party
.
<EOS>
without
address
him
,
Jane
contrive
to
give
him
such
information
as
she
think
would
be
interesting
,
and
whenever
they
skirt
a
large
park
,
or
come
in
sight
of
an
ancient
mansion
,
she
mention
the
name
of
the
owner
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Petre
be
lively
and
chatty
,
but
her
husband
be
full
of
secret
anxiety
,
be
apprehensive
,
as
we
have
say
,
of
au
encounter
with
Roundhead
trooper
.
<EOS>
this
anxiety
be
entirely
on
his
own
account
,
for
he
have
no
suspicion
of
the
important
charge
committed
to
him
.
<EOS>
have
he
be
consult
,
we
fear
he
would
have
shrink
from
such
a
heavy
responsibility
.

as
high
as
any
ground
in
England
,
this
fine
old
mansion
command
a
magnificent
prospect
over
a
most
lovely
country
.
<EOS>
from
its
elevated
position
,
the
stately
pile
could
be
descry
afar
,
and
on
learn
to
whom
it
belong
,
Charles
regard
the
house
with
great
interest
,
and
be
well
pleased
by
reflection
that
Jane
may
one
day
become
its

<EOS>
the
mansion
be
embosome
in

suddenly

<EOS>
"
why

Will
,
thy

have
cast
a
shoe
.
<EOS>
luckily
,
we
be
near
a
village
,
where
thou
wilt
be
sure
to
find
a
blacksmith
.
"
 
<EOS>
presently
they
come
to
a
pretty
little
inn
,
very
pleasantly
situate
on
the
outskirt
of
the
village
,
and
have
a
large
tree
in
front
of
it
,
encircle
by
a
bench
.
<EOS>
here
the

burly

with
a
broad
honest
face
begrime

<EOS>
His
brawny
arm
be
bare
to
the
shoulder
,
and
a
leather
apron
be
tie
round
his
waist
.
<EOS>
pleased
by
his
physiognomy
,
Charles
take
it
into
his
head
that
the
man
must
be
a
Royalist
,
but
in
this
he
be
mistaken
.
<EOS>
the
blacksmith
prove
to
be
a
sturdy
,
outspoken
Republican
.
 
<EOS>
not
happen
to
be
busy
at
the

,
and
have
select

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay

I

"
rejoin
Bryan
.
<EOS>
"
We
hear
but
little

to
you

learn
that

<EOS>
He

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
right
,
"
say
Charles
,
"
and
I
think
he
must
have
find
out
his
mistake
.
<EOS>
It
seem
the
Scots
would
not
stand
by
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
stand
by
him
!
<EOS>
not

<EOS>
They
soon

from
Old
Noll

<EOS>
I
hope
they
be
all

out
of

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
have
hear
say

the

prosecute
that

<EOS>
Careless
would
fain
have
go
on

Stratford

on

Avon

his

deem
it
safe

proceed
in
this
quiet
manner

with
an
attendance
liable
to
attract
attention

stop

It

therefore
agree

follow
their

master
next
day

could

Their

<EOS>
occasionally
they
meet
a
farmer
and
his
wife
on
a
"
double
horse
,
"
but
none
of
the
gentry
of
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
the
latter
evidently
deem
it
prudent
to
keep
at
home
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Petre
often
pull
up
to
have
a
word
with
the
husbandman
,
and
their
talk
be
generally
concern
the
battle
of
Worcester
.
<EOS>
many
sympathise
with
the
king
for
his
misfortune
,
and
express
concern
at
his
defeat
;
but
all
blame
him
for
bring
the
Scots
to
England
.
 
<EOS>
thus
they
journey
on
through
a
rich
agricultural
district

till
they

tract
that
have
once
form
part
of
the
Forest
of
Arden
,
some
vestige
of
which

<EOS>
these
woodland
offer
a
pleasant
contrast
to
the
richly
cultivate
district
just
leave
behind

and
have
skirt
a
park

they
reach
the
picturesque
old

here
they

to
view
the

which
then
stand
in
the

<EOS>
to
support
his
character
,
Charles
think
it
necessary
to
drink
a
pot
of
ale
with
the
ostler

and
the
man

tongue
be
loosen
by
the

till
they
draw
near

<EOS>
how
they
arrive
at
LONG
MARSTON
 
apart
from
be
the
birthplace
and
the
burial
-
place
of
Shakspeare
,
Stratford
-
on
-
Avon
have
a
special
interest
to
Charles
from
the
circumstance
that
it
have
be
the
temporary
residence
of
his
mother
,
Queen
Henrietta
Maria
,
who
,
in
1643
-
-some
eight
year
anterior
to
the
period
of
our
story
--
enter
the
old
town
at
the
head
of
a
large
force
,
and
be
subsequently
join
there
by
Prince
Rupert
.
<EOS>
Charles
remember
also
that
Stratford
have
be
the
scene
of
more
than
one
sharp
conflict
between
the
Royalists
and
the
rebel
,
and
that
an
arch
of
the
old
stone
bridge
have
be
break
down
by
the
latter
to
prevent
the
attack
of
their
opponent
.
<EOS>
these
reflection
occur
to
the
king
as
he
and
his
fair
companion
halt
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
charming
old
town
.
 
<EOS>
before
them
,
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
Avon
,
stand
the
ancient
church
,
in
the
vault
of
which
rest
Shakspeare
's
hallowed
bone
.
<EOS>
but
the
bridge
be
guard
by
a
party
of
cavalry
draw
up
in
front
of
it
.
<EOS>
nothing
have
be
see
of
Mr.
Petre
and
his
wife
,
since
they
have
go
off
in
another
direction
at
Wootton
,
and
Jane
wait
for
them
for
some
time
before
enter
Stratford
;
but
as
they
do
not
make
their
appearance
she
at
last
agree
to
go
on
without
them
,
and
Charles
ride
on
towards
the
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
never
in
the
conflict
that
have
take
place
on
that
bridge
during
the
Civil
War
do
Cavalier
ride
up
to
the
enemy
with
bold
front
than
the
king
now
display
.
<EOS>
He
be
sharply
examine
by
the
trooper
as
he
advance
,
but
Jane
,
again
produce
her
pass
,
answer
the
question
of
the
officer
in
command
so
satisfactorily
,
that
they
be
at
once
allow
to
pass
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
she
accomplish
the
liberation
of
her
brother
-
in
-
law
and
his
wife
,
who
have
be
detain
till
her
arrival
.
 
<EOS>
all
difficulty
be
thus
surmount
the
party
cross
the
bridge--
note
that
the
break
arch
have
only
be
partially
repair
--
and
enter
the
old
town
in
triumph
.
<EOS>
under
pleasanter
circumstance
they
may
have
be
dispose
to
halt
for
a
short
time
at
Stratford
,
and
Jane
,
cast
a
longing
look
at
the
avenue
of
lime
-
tree
lead
to
the
church
,
suggest
a
visit
to
the
beautiful
old
fabric
,
but
Mr.
Petre
would
not
hear
of
it
.
<EOS>
not
to
excite
suspicion
they
ride
at
a
very
deliberate
pace
through
the
town
,
be
regard
with
some
curiosity
by
the
townsfolk
,
and
frown
at
by
a
few
trooper
collect
in
the
market
-
place
;
but
as
they
have
pass
the
ordeal
of
the
bridge
it
be
presume
by
those
who
watch
them
that
they
must
be
well
affected
towards
the
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Petre
feel
much
easy
in
his
mind
when
he
get
out
of
Stratford
,
but
chance
to
cast
a
look
behind
him
<EOS>
he
see
a
couple
of
trooper
pursue
the
same
course
,
and
fancy
they
must
be
follow
him
his
fear
return
.
<EOS>
He
mention
his
apprehension
to
his
wife
and
Jane
,
but
they
treat
them
very
lightly
.
 
<EOS>
for
some
little
time
the
road
pursue
by
the
party
lie
along
the
bank
of
the
Avon
,
and
offer
delightful
view
of
the
town
they
have
just
quit
,
with
its
picturesque
old
church
and
bridge
;
but
after
they
have
proceed
about
a
mile
they
quit
the
gently
-
flow
river
,
and
strike
across
a
wild
district
that
present
but
few

.
<EOS>
however
,
they
be
now
not
far
from
their
destination
,
but
before
they
reach
it
the
aspect
of
the
country
have
materially
improve
.

,
Long
Marston
look
like
what
it

,
the
abode
of
an
unostentatious

<EOS>
the

with

for

I

<EOS>
and

"

one
of

,
designate
Charles

<EOS>
"
We

he
may
be
a
malignant

in
a

<EOS>
this
consideration
bring
the
cook
to
reason
,
and
she
leave
the
kitchen
,
and
presently
return
with
a
foam
jug
of
ale
.
<EOS>
during
her
absence
the
trooper
have
seat
themselves
at
a
table
,
and
as
it
be
clear
they
would
not
depart
without
some
refreshment
,
Bridget
go
back
for
some
cold
meat
and
bread
,
while
Charles
pour
out

by
the
time

<EOS>
Charles
wait
upon

so
much
by
his
attention

that
they
go
away
at
last
declaring
he
be
a
very
honest
young
man
,
and
have
nothing
of

malignant
about
him

<EOS>
shortly
afterwards

by
Jane

<EOS>
great
consternation
have
be
cause
by
the
visit
of
the
trooper
,
but
as
the
man
conduct
themselves
so
quietly
and
make
no
disturbance
,
Mr.
Tombs
hope
they
may
be
get
rid
of
without
any
interference
on
his
part

<EOS>
at
last

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
most
likely
they
only
want
a
supper

Bridget
;

"
 
<EOS>
"
They
put
a
few
question
to

the
king
.
<EOS>
"
but
I

"
 
<EOS>
"
They

"
remark
Mr.

in

<EOS>
"
now
I

more
narrowly

<EOS>
besides

it
be
fair
to
tell
you
that
my

by
the
glance
he
throw
at
you
as
we
come
into

<EOS>
the
king

eye
be
fix
upon
them

and
before
make
a
reply
Jane
consult
him
by
a
look

<EOS>
She
then
take
Mr.

aside
,
so
as
to
be
quite
out

Bridget

hearing
,
and
say
in
a
whisper
:
 
"
You

right

<EOS>
Will
Jones
be
not
what

<EOS>

I

rejoin
Mr.

in
the
same
tone

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
must
be
a
person
of
the
high
importance

I
know
you
would
not

this
great
risk
for
any
one
of
inferior
degree

<EOS>
I
have
my
suspicion

give

but
be
careful
not

betray
the
secret
by
word
or
gesture

<EOS>
You
must
not

take
your
wife
into
your
confidence

<EOS>
My
sister
and
her
husband
be
entirely
in
the
dark

and
must
be
keep
so

suspicion
if
he
say
more

as

be
in

to

could
save
him

he
quit

off
into

they

a
heavy
thunder

a
place
of
shelter

<EOS>
They
be
again
on
the
Foss
Way
,
with
nothing
but
the
bare
wold
spread
out
around
them
,
like
the
billow
of
a
tempestuous
sea

<EOS>
Jane
point
out
a
solitary
barn
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off

and
as
soon
as

could
descend
from
the
elevated

quickly
in

direction

just
as

<EOS>
the
flash
of

the
peal
of

and
the
rain

down
in
torrent

<EOS>
It
be
now
so
dark
<EOS>
that
except
for
the
lightning
they
could
not

many
yard
before

and
as
Charles
ride
into

he
call
out
to

whether
any

and
fasten

up

<EOS>
this

they

look
out
through
the
open
door
upon
the
wold
,
and
watch
the
progress
of

storm
,
when
a
bright
flash
than
any
that

before
reveal
a
startling
spectacle
.
 
<EOS>
"

by
the
oddity
of
the
response

I
prepare

when

take

he

it

say
he
should
prefer
some
mulled
sack

you

nothing
seem
good
enough

army
under
Colonel
Bagot

constantly

so
that

gravely

I

Pope
have
find

out

"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
would

<EOS>
but
I
can
trust
him

for
I
know
him
to
be
an
honest
fellow

who
would
scorn

betray
his
sovereign

"
 
<EOS>
"
I

I

and
as
he
speak
he
kneel
down

kiss
the
hand
which
Charles
graciously
extend
to
him

<EOS>
"
do
not

your
zeal

you
into
any
indiscretion

show
me
no
mark
of
respect

any
one
be
present

Mistress

continue
to
treat
me
as
Will
Jones

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
carefully
attend
to
your
majesty
's
injunction

"
say
Pope
.
 
<EOS>
feel
now
quite
sure
that
the
king
would
be
well
attend
to
<EOS>
,
Jane
leave
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
loyal
butler
have
his
own
duty
to
fulfil
,
and
could
not
neglect
them
without
exciting
suspicion
.
<EOS>
pray
the
king
,
therefore
,
to
excuse
him
,
he
proceed
to
serve
supper

while
he
be
thus
occupy

Margaret
Rider

by
his

for
more
than
an
hour
Charles
be
leave
alone
in
the
butler
's
pantry

but
at
the
end
of
that
time
Pope
reappear
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
now
entirely
at
your
majesty
's
service

"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
sit
down
,
and
take
a
cup
of
metheglin

Charles
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
have
a
chat
with
you

<EOS>
after
some
hesitation
the
butler
comply

<EOS>
"
to
prove
that
I
place
entire
confidence

"
observe
the
king
,
"
I
will
tell
you
what
I
desire
to
do
,
and
possibly
you
can
aid
me
.
<EOS>
My
object
be
to
obtain
a
passage
for
France
.
<EOS>
do
you
think
I
shall
be
able
to
find
a
vessel
at
Bristol
to
take
me
to
Bordeaux
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
few
vessel
sail
from
Bristol
to
France
,
my
liege
.
<EOS>
You
have
better
hire
a
schooner
for
Cardiff
or
Swansea
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
have
no
money
,
"
say
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mistress
Jane
Lane
can
procure
any
sum
your
majesty
may
require
from
Mr.
Norton
,
"
reply
Pope
.
"
<EOS>
but
of
course
she
will
be
oblige
to
enter
into
explanation
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
feel
uneasy
on
that
score
,
because
I
know
your
master
can
be
trust
,
"
observe
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
quite
certain
,
"
rejoin
Pope
.
"
<EOS>
but
with
your
majesty
's
leave
,
the
first
thing
to
be
do
be
to
ascertain
that
a
vessel
can
be
hire
.
<EOS>
there
be
plenty
of
ship
-
master
,
plenty
of
ship
,
and
plenty
of
seaman
to
be
find
at
Bristol
,
but
one
do
not
know
whom
to
trust
.
<EOS>
or
rather
,
I
should
say
,
one
can
not
trust
any
of
the
skipper
,
since
most
of
them
be
roundhead
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
desire
it
I
will
go
with
your
majesty
to
Bristol
to
-
morrow
night
.
<EOS>
at
the
Dolphin
,
a
tavern
near
the
quay
,
frequent
by
seafare
man
,
we
may
be
able
to
pick
up
some
information
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
will
it
be
safe
for
me
to
go
to
a
tavern
like
the
Dolphin
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
I
think
there
be
the
slight
risk
I
would
not
offer
to
take
your
majesty
there
,
"
reply
Pope
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
well
known
to
David
Price
,
the
keeper
of
the
tavern
,
and
he
will
not
question
any
one
I
may
take
to
his
house
.
<EOS>
possibly
we
may
obtain
from
him
all
the
information
we
require
.
<EOS>
if
I
succeed
in
obtain
your
majesty
a
passage
to
Bordeaux
--
or
even
to
Swansea
--
I
shall
esteem
myself
the
happy
of
man

"
 
<EOS>
shortly
afterwards
Pope
conduct
the
king
to
the
pretty
little
chamber
prepare
for
him

needless
to
say
that
his

sleep

CARELESS
brings
<EOS>
the
king
good
news
 
<EOS>
next
morning
Charles
be
alone
in
the
butler
's
pantry
,
when
Mr.
Norton
,
accompany
by
Doctor
Gorges
,
who
have
be
the
late
king
's
chaplain
,
and
now
fill
the
same
office
at
Abbots
Leigh
,
come
into
the
room
to
inquire
after
him
.
<EOS>
the
appearance
of
the
latter
,
with
whom
he
be
well
acquainted
,
rather
confused
Charles
,
as
he
fear
that
the
chaplain
must
recognise
him
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
divine
suspect
no
deception
,
and
Charles
act
his
part
so
well
that
he
completely
impose
upon
the
worthy
man
.
<EOS>
the
interview
do
not
last
many
minute
,
and
be
interrupt
by
Jane
Lane
,
who
come
to
the
king
's
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
have
not
overact
my
part
,
"
observe
the
king
to
Jane
,
as
soon
as
Mr.
Norton
and
the
chaplain
be
go
.
<EOS>
"
but
it
occur
to
me
that
my
recovery
be
too
rapid
,
and
that
I
ought
to
have
a
relapse
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
act
the
part
so
naturally
,
my
liege
,
that
you
would
certainly
have
impose
upon
me
,
<EOS>
have
I
not
be
a
confederate
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
sure
to
be
spread
about
among
the
household
that
you
have
have
another
attack
,
and
as
the
servant
may
have
think
your
conduct
strange
in
keep
aloof
from
them
,
their
suspicion
will
now
be
remove
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
go
forth
presently
,
"
say
the
king
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
likely
that
Careless
may
venture
here
in
the
course
of
the
day
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
inform
Jane
of
his
intention
to
visit
Bristol
at
night
with
Pope
,
for
the
purpose
of
hire
a
vessel
to
convey
him
to
France
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
I
succeed
in
my
object
I
shall
not
return
here
,
"
he
say
;
"
and
in
that
case
I
shall
not
require
your
further
service
.
<EOS>
You
will
then
be
at
full
liberty
to
inform
Mr.
Norton
who
have
be
his
guest
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
be
quite
sure
your
majesty
be
safe
before
I
make
any
such
communication
to
him
,
"
she
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
Pope
return
alone
,
you
will
know
that
I
be
go
,
"
say
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
grant
that
your
majesty
may
find
mean
of
escape
!
"
say
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
I
own
I
be
not
very
sanguine
,
and
I
implore
you
not
to
run
any
heedless
risk
.
<EOS>
I
think
there
be
great
hazard
in
visit
Bristol
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
then
quit
the
room
,
and
Charles
,
who
find
his
confinement
rather
irksome
,
go
to
the
stable
,
where
he
remain
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
return
to
the
house
,
but
pass
through
a
retire
part
of
the
garden
gain
the
long
avenue
lead
to
the
mansion
.
 
<EOS>
while
wend
his
way
slowly
beneath
the
overarch
tree
,
he
perceive
a
horseman
at
a
distance
ride
towards
the
house
.
<EOS>
as
the
person
draw
near
,
he
feel
almost
certain
it
must
be
Careless
--
but
if
so
,
Careless
have
abandon
his
disguise
as
a
groom
,
and
attire
himself
in
a
costume
more
befitting
his
condition
.
<EOS>
careless
it
prove
to
be
,
and
no
sooner
do
he
discern
his
royal
master
,
than
he
quicken
his
pace
and
ride
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
meet
,
my
liege
,
"
he
exclaim
,
spring
from
his
steed
and
salute
the
king
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
in
quest
of
your

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
bring
me
good

reply
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
have
throw
off
your

"
I
find
it
necessary
to
do
so

Careless

"
<EOS>
habit
as
a

<EOS>
I
should
never

<EOS>
luckily
,
at
the
Lamb
,
where
I
put
up
,
I
meet
with
Tom
Hornyold
of
Worcester
,
who
not

me
with
a
good

of

but
with
a
change
of
attire
.
<EOS>
thus
provide
,
I
lose
not
a
moment
in
endeavour
to
carry
out
your
majesty
's
plan
.
<EOS>
by
Tom
Hornyold
's
advice
,
I
repair
to
the
Dolphin
,
a
tavern
frequent
by
ship
-
master
and
seafare
man
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
quay--
"
 
"
and
keep
by
David
Price
,
"
interpose
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
majesty
know
the
tavern
?
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Careless
,
in
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
of
it
,
"
reply
Charles
.
"
<EOS>
but
proceed
.
<EOS>
do
you
see
the
tavern
-
keeper
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
my
liege
,
and
find
him
exactly
the
man
describe
by
Tom
Hornyold
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
long
conference
with
him
in
private
,
and
tell
him
I
want
to
hire
a
vessel
to
convey
me
to
France
,
and
if
that
could
not
be
manage
,
to
Swansea
.
<EOS>
I
say
that
I
mean
to
take
with
me
a
young
dame
,
to
whom
I
be
about
to
be
wed
--
but
whose
parent
object
to
the
match--
"
 
"
Dame
give
,
I
suppose
?
"
observe
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
exactly
,
my
liege
.
<EOS>
I
have
previously
obtain
her
consent
to
the
scheme
.
<EOS>
but
your
majesty
have
not
hear
me
out
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
necessary
to
acquaint
David
Price
that
I
should
be
accompany
by
a
friend
--
a
fugitive
royalist
who
have
fight
at
Worcester
--
but
I
take
care
not
to
lead
him
to
suspect
that
my
friend
be
a
person
of
rank
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
what
follow
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
listen
to
all
I
say
,
and
after
some
reflection
,
reply
that
he
know
the
master
of
a
small
lugger
,
who
he
think
may
be
induce
by
a
good
round
sum
to
convey
me
,
my
intend
bride
,
and
my
friend
to
Swansea
.
'
<EOS>
I
think
the
man
be
in
the
house
now
,
'
he
add
.
'
<EOS>
if
you
desire
it
,
I
will
call
him
in
here
,
and
you
can
speak
to
him
yourself
?
'
<EOS>
I
say
this
be
exactly
what
I
wish
,
so
he
go
out
,
and
shortly
afterwards
return
with
a
sturdy
,
broad
-
shouldered
man
,
whom
he
introduce
as
Captain
Rooker
.
<EOS>
the
skipper
have
an
honest
look
that
prepossess
me
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
in
order
to
give
a
friendly
character
to
the
interview
,
David
Price
place
a
flask
of
Nantz
on
the
table
,
and
fill
a
glass
for
each
of
us
.
<EOS>
My
object
have
be
explain
to
Captain
Rooker
,
he
enter
upon
the
matter
at
once
.
<EOS>
He
say
it
be
a
hazardous
job
,
and
may
get
him
into
trouble
,
but
as
he
sympathise
strongly
with
the
Royalist
party
he
would
undertake
to
assist
me
,
provide
he
be
well
pay
.
<EOS>
after
some
talk
he
agree
to
take
me
and
my
companion
to
Swansea
for
fifty
pound
--
but
he
require
twenty
pound
down
,
which
by
David
Price
's
advice
I
pay
him
.
<EOS>
I
hope
your
majesty
will
think
I
have
do
well
in
make
the
arrangement
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You

joyfully

<EOS>
"

"
<EOS>

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
unable
to
inform
your
majesty
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
all
I
know
be
,
that
Captain
Rooker
mean
to
send
his
lugger
down
the
Avon
to
-
day
,
and
the
vessel
will
wait
for
us
at
some
point
where
we
can
safely
go
on

.
<EOS>
come
to
Bristol
to

then
I
shall
be
able
to
give

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You

forestall

<EOS>
"
I
have
arrange
with

We

I

say
the

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
at
nine
o'clock

Thereupon

though

thickness
of
the
wood
into

,
the

be
well
acquaint
with
the

so
that
they
be
in
no
danger
of
take
a
wrong
course
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
a
relief
when
they
emerge
from
the
thicket
,
and
gain
the
open
ground
,
know
as
Stokeleigh

<EOS>
as

while

near
St.

Redcliffe

pile
,
the
outline
of
which
noble

They

before

He

You

<EOS>
about
two
year
ago
Colonel
Wyndham
marry
Mistress
Anne
Gerard
,
daughter
and
heiress
of
Squire
Thomas
Gerard
,
of
trent
,
in
Somersetshire
.
<EOS>
since
then
he
have
go
with
his
wife
to
live
at
Trent
.
<EOS>
His
mother
,
Lady
Wyndham
,
widow
of
Sir
Thomas
Wyndham
,
likewise
reside
with
him
.
<EOS>
as
your
majesty
may
not
be
acquaint
with
Trent
,
I
will
describe
its
position
.
'
<EOS>
tis
a
small
secluded
village
<EOS>
,
charmingly
situate
,
about
midway
between
Sherborne
and
Yeovil
,
and
consist
of
a
few
scattered
habitation
--
cottage
,
I
ought
perhaps
to
call
them
--
in
the
midst
of
which
,
surround
by
fine
old
elm
-
tree
,
stand
the
ancient
mansion
.
<EOS>
close
to
the
yard
gate
--
within
a
bow
-
shot
of
the
house
--
be
the
church
,
a
fine
old
pile
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
manor
-
house
<EOS>
well
,
for
I
have
often
be
there
,
and
,
unless
I
be
greatly
mistaken
,
it
contain
hiding
-
place
,
in
which
your
majesty
could
be
securely
conceal
should
any
search
be
make
.
<EOS>
the
position
of
trent
be
extremely
favourable
to
your
plan
.
<EOS>
not
only
be
it
out
of
the
main
road
,
and
extremely
retired
,
but
it
be
within
a
few
hour
'
ride
of
the
coast
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
whatever
that
Colonel
Wyndham
will
be
able
to
procure
you
a
vessel
at
Lyme
Regis
to
transport
you
to
France
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
not
the
colonel
take
prisoner
when
be
surrender
Dunster
Castle
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
take
to
Weymouth
,
my
liege
,
but
release
on
his
parole
,
so
that
he
can
move
about
without
fear
of
arrest
.
<EOS>
formerly
he
reside
at
Sherborne
,
and
be
there
jealously
watch
by
the
Parliamentarians
,
but
since
his
removal
to
Trent
he
have
not
be
subject
to
so
much
annoyance
.
<EOS>
Your
majesty
may
wonder
that
I
know
so
much
about
him
,
but
I
be
well
acquaint
with
the
colonel
's
man
,
Harry
Peters
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
decide
me
,
"
cry
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
to
Trent
.
<EOS>
Major
Careless
shall
serve
as
my
avant
courier
to
apprise
Colonel
Wyndham
that
I
be
come
to
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
shortly
afterwards
Charles
repair
to
the
butler
's
pantry
,
where
he
breakfast
,
take
care
when
any
of
the
servant
come
in
to
feign
great
debility
.
 
<EOS>
after
breakfast
he
proceed
to
the
stable
,
and
watch
his
opportunity
,
mount
to
the
loft
in
which
he
have
learn
from
Pope
that
Careless
be
conceal
.
 
<EOS>
a
slight
signal
bring
out
his
faithful
follower
,
whose
altered
look
and
manner
could
not
fail
to
grieve
the
king
.
<EOS>
Careless
's
natural
gaiety
seem
to
have
entirely
desert
him
,
and
have
give
place
to
a
gloomy
,
almost
stern
,
expression
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
at
your
majesty
's
order
,
"
he
say
,
salute
the
king
respectfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
be
there
aught
I
can
do
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
look
so
ill
,
"
rejoin
Charles
,
in
accent
of
deep
concern
,
"
that
I
hesitate
to
put
your
devotion
to
further
test
.
<EOS>
You
need
repose
.
<EOS>
take
it
,
and
we
will
talk
further
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
action
will
cure
me
sooner
than
rest
,
"
rejoin
Careless
,
with
a
ghastly
smile
.
"
<EOS>
sleep
seem
to
shun
me
,
or
if
I
close
my
weary
eyelid
for
a
moment
,
I
start
up
again
in
horror
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ease
your
breast
,
and
tell
me
what
have
happen
,
"
say
the
king
,
in
tone
that
bespoke
his
profound
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
powerful
struggle
,
Careless
conquer
his
emotion
sufficiently
to
enable
him
to
speak
coherently
,
and
say
:
 
"
You
know
what
anguish
I
endure
when
she
whom
I
love
so
dearly
expire
in
my
arm
.
<EOS>
I
swear
to
avenge
her
,
and
I
have
keep
my
oath
.
<EOS>
no
sooner
be
your
majesty
go
than
I
prepare
to
execute
my
purpose
,
and
I
find
Pope
,
whose
blood
be
up
,
well
disposed
to
second
me
.
<EOS>
from
the
sound
we
hear
,
we
feel
sure
that
the
two
murderous
caitiff
be
still
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
Avon
.
<EOS>
while
I
lay
down
the
body
tenderly
,
Pope
push
the
boat
to
the
other
side
of
the
river
,
and
enable
me
to
leap
ashore
.
<EOS>
the
villain
be
hurry
towards
the
spot
,
and
as
soon
as
they
descry
me
through
the
gloom
,
they
both
discharge
their
pistol
at
me
,
but
the
bullet
whistle
past
me
harmlessly
.
<EOS>
I
return
the
fire
with
well
effect
,
for
I
bring
down
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
sword
in
hand
,
I
then
rush
upon
the
other
,
and
a
sharp
conflict
take
place
between
us

<EOS>
infuriate
as
I
be
,
he
be
no
match
for
me
,
and
I
drive
him
to
the
edge
of
the
precipitous
bank
.
<EOS>
He
make
a
desperate
effort
to
avoid
his
fate
,
but
I
still
press
fiercely
on
,
smote
him
,
and
with
a
wild
cry
he
fall
backwards
,
and
be
instantly
sweep
away
by
the
rapid
current
.
<EOS>
have
thus
execute
my
vengeful
task
,
I
return
to
the
boat
,
and
be
quickly
transport
to
the
opposite
bank
by
Pope
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
now
arise
the
painful
question
--
how
be
her
love
remain
to
be
dispose
of
?
<EOS>
I
be
almost
distract
by
the
thought
of
leave
her

<EOS>
yet
what
else
could
be
do
?
<EOS>
at
last
,
however
,
the
difficulty
be
unexpectedly
solve
.
<EOS>
Pope
have
fasten
the
boat
to
a
tree
,
and
have
come
ashore
to
confer
with
me
.
<EOS>
We
be
anxiously
deliberate
together
,
when
the
boat
,
contain
her
loved
remain
,
suddenly
disappear
!
<EOS>
It
be
sweep
away
in
an
instant
--
go
beyond
the
possibility
of
recovery
.
<EOS>
doubtless
,
as
Pope
suggest
,
the
rope
with
which
he
endeavour
to
secure
the
bark
,
have
become
loose
,
and
so
the
disaster
occur
.
<EOS>
but
I
look
upon
it
then
--
as
I
regard
it
now
--
as
a
cruel
stroke
of
fate
,
by
which
I
be
deprive
of
the
sad
consolation
of
see
her
decently
inter
.

there

which

by
his
look
how
profoundly
he
sympathise
with
his
attendant

fear
not

find
a

say
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
do
more
than
you
have
do

<EOS>
My
firm
conviction
be
that
she
will
find
a
rest
-
place
in
some
quiet
churchyard

not
at

"
<EOS>
no

nay

not

so
well
.
<EOS>
as
the
bearer
of
such
joyful
tiding
thou
art
doubly
welcome
,
Will
.
<EOS>
and
think
not
there
be
need
of

<EOS>
I
will
answer
my
womankind
as
I
would
for

<EOS>
of
my

Lady

I

<EOS>

and
know

<EOS>
and
my
fair

be
as
loyal
as

<EOS>
They
have
be
profoundly
grieve
by
the
rumour
I
have
just
allude
to

but
Juliana
refuse
to

confident
belief
that

still

and
will
be
restore

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
clear
from
what
you
say
,
Frank
,
that
there
will
be
no
risk
in
communicate
the
secret
to
your
lady
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
fear
nothing
.
<EOS>
woman
can
keep
a
secret
as
well
as
we
man
can

well
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
My
household
consist
of
some
twenty
person

I
firmly
believe
there
be
not
a
traitor
among
them

<EOS>

that
be
much
to

<EOS>
"
Peters

not

they

but
come
in
.
<EOS>
I
be
anxious
to
acquaint
the
lady
with
the
good
news
respect
the
king

"
 
<EOS>
He
then
take
Careless
into
the
house
,
and
lead
him
to
a
parlour
,
which
be
light
by
a
lamp
place
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
in
this
room
three
lady
be
assemble
,
two
of
them
be
young
,
and
engage
on
some
feminine
occupation
,
while
the
third
and
old

the
party
be
read
a
devotional
work

<EOS>
the
elderly
dame

as
will
be
surmise
,
be
the
colonel

<EOS>
Lady

a
stately
figure
and
a
dignified
deportment
,
and
though
her
finely
form
feature
bear
the
impress
of
age
,
they
be
still
regular
in
outline
.
<EOS>
Her
costume
belong
to
an
early
period
,
and
suit
her
well
.
<EOS>
Her
daughter
-
in

law
,
Mrs.
Wyndham
,
the
heiress
to
whom
the
colonel
owe
Trent
,
possess
considerable
personal
attraction

magnificent
black
eye
and
luxuriant
black

<EOS>
a
striking

<EOS>
when
she
smile
--
and
she
smile
very
frequently
--
two
row
of
exquisite
pearl
be
display
.
<EOS>
Juliana
be
just
nineteen
,
and
our
description
would
be
incomplete
if
we
do
not
add
that
her
figure
be
slight
and
exceedingly
graceful
.
 
<EOS>
Careless
's
appearance
cause
some
excitement
among
the
company
.
<EOS>
as
we
have
intimate
,
he
be
know
to
Lady

,
who
receive
him
very
cordially
,
and
after

word
to

he
be
present
in
due
form
to
the
other

.
 
<EOS>
when
the
presentation
have
take
place
,
Colonel
Wyndham
remark
:
 
"
Major

very
good
news

<EOS>
the

Worcester
be
utterly
unfounded
.
<EOS>
His

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
vouch
for
that
,
since

this
morning

"
add
Careless
.
 
<EOS>
joyful
exclamation
arise
from
all
.
<EOS>
Juliana
clap
her
hand
together
,
and
call
out
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
!
<EOS>
I
know
the
king
be
safe
.
<EOS>
nothing
would
persuade
me
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
just
as
sure
now
that
he
will
escape
his
enemy
,
and
regain
the
throne
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
majesty
will
be
delighted
to
find
he
have
such
a
zealous
partisan
,
"
observe
Careless
,
smile
at
her
vivacity
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
give
him
the
assurance
from
your
own
lip
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
have
an
opportunity
of
do
so

<EOS>
"
then
your

"
say
Colonel
Wyndham
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
very
soon
have
an
opportunity

"
 
<EOS>
His
wife
and
Lady
Wyndham
be
greatly
surprised
by
the
announcement
,
and
question
him
as
to
its
meaning
by
their
look
;
but
Juliana
call
out
:
 
<EOS>
"
You

Frank

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
not

<EOS>

but
I
will
not

you
longer
in

<EOS>
"
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
moderate
yourself
my
love

"
say
Mrs.
Wyndham
,
who
look
scarcely
less
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
his
majesty
's
harbinger
,
I
suppose
?
"
say
Lady
Wyndham
to
Careless
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
ladyship
be
right
,
"
he
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
attend
the
king
ever
since
the
great
disaster
at
Worcester
.
<EOS>
several
attempt
which
he
have
make
to
escape
to
France
,
have
be
frustrate
,
and
he
have
therefore
resolve
to
abide
a
time
when
the
vigilance
of
his
enemy
shall
relax
.
<EOS>
with
this
design
he
have
fix
upon
Trent
House
as
a
retreat
,
feel
well
assured
that
he
have
not
a
more
devoted
adherent
than
Colonel
Francis
Wyndham
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
majesty
have
form
a
just
opinion
of
my
son
,
"
say
Lady
Wyndham
.
<EOS>
"
He
will
be
quite
safe
under
his
roof
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
woman
be
not
generally
trust
with
important
secret
,
"
observe
Mrs.
Wyndham
.
"
<EOS>
but
his
majesty
nee
fear
no
indiscretion
on
our
part
.
<EOS>
Juliana
be
sometimes
rather
thoughtless
,
but
she
will
now
see
the
necessity
of
keep
strict
guard
upon
her
tongue
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
yet
have
a
secret
confide
to
me
,
"
say
the
young
lady
in
question
;
"
but
if
everybody
be
as
careful
as
I
shall
be
his
majesty
will
not
be
in
much
danger
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
assure
Major
Careless
that
the
servant
can
be
rely
upon
,
"
say
Colonel
Wyndham
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
they
be
all
perfectly
faithful
and
honest
,
"
say
his
wife
.
"
<EOS>
but
of
course
every
precaution
shall
be
observe
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
majesty
shall
have
my
room
,
"
say
Lady
Wyndham
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
describe
it
to
you
,
Major
.
<EOS>
Careless
,
and
then
you
will
judge
of
its
fitness
for
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
in
this
part
of
the
house
,
but
be
situate
above
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
It
be
reasonably
large
,
and
lofty
than
you
would
expect
,
because
the
ceiling
be
raise
into
the
roof
and
support
by
oaken
rafter
.
<EOS>
on
either
side
be
lattice
window
which
look
into
the
garden
and
command
the
yard
,
so
that
his
majesty
would
be
make
immediately
aware
of
the
arrival
of
any
dangerous
visitor
.
<EOS>
the
room
be
wainscote
with
old
oak
,
and
at
one
end
be
a
secret
closet
in
which
the
king
could
take
refuge
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
all
.
<EOS>
a
movable
board
within
the
closet
afford
access
to
a
short
,
narrow
staircase
contrive
in
the
wall
,
by
mean
of
which
an
outbuilding
can
be
gain
,
and
thus
any
search
may
be
elude
.
<EOS>
I
must
not
omit
to
mention
that
in
the
principal
room
there
be
a
small
cupboard
,
conceal
by
a
slide
panel
,
and
in
this
cupboard
wine
and
provision
may
be
store
.
<EOS>
but
you
must
see
the
room
yourself
.
<EOS>
no
other
apartment
in
the
house
offer
such
facility
for
concealment
and
flight
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
ladyship
's
description
be
so
clear
,
"
say
Careless
,
"
that
I
need
not
see
the
room
to
decide
that
it
be
exactly
suitable
to
the
king
's
present
requirement
.
<EOS>
My
only
concern
be
that
you
should
be
oblige
to
relinquish
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Poh
!
<EOS>
that
be
a
mere
trifle
,
"
exclaim
the
loyal
old
dame
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
give
up
all
I
possess
to
benefit
his
majesty
.
<EOS>
I
shall
easily
find
another
room
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
mine
,
dear
aunt
,
"
cry
Juliana
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
when
be
his
majesty
's
arrival
to
be
expect
?
"
inquire
Colonel
Wyndham
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
stay
at
Abbots
Leigh
,
near
Bristol
,
"
reply
careless
.
<EOS>
"
in
all
probability
he
will
leave
there
to
-
morrow
morning
,
attend
by
Mistress
Jane
Lane
and
Sir
Clement
Fisher
,
but
he
will
not
proceed
beyond
Castle
Cary
.
<EOS>
early
on
the
follow
day

may
be
look
for
here

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
all
shall
be
ready
for
him
,
"
say
Colonel
Wyndham
.
 
<EOS>
a
long
conversation
then
ensue
,
which
it
be
not
needful
to
report
.
<EOS>
the
lady
have
a
number
of
question
to
ask
respect
the
fatal
fight
at
Worcester
and
the
king
's
subsequent
adventure
,
and
while
Careless
gratify
their
natural
curiosity
,
Colonel
Wyndham
leave
the
room
to
give
direction
for
the
accommodation
of
his
unexpected
,
though
most
welcome
guest
.
<EOS>
Careless
's
auditor
listen
with
the
deep
interest
to
his
vivid
description
of
the
king
's
hair
-
breadth
'
scape
,
but
no
one
be
so
excited
by
the
relation
as
Juliana
Coningsby
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
first
moment
when
she
behold
the
king
's
faithful
messenger
,
Juliana
have
be
strike
by
his
appearance
,
but
when
he
recount
some
stirring
incident
in
which
he
himself
,
as
well
as
his
royal
master
,
have
take
part

when
his
eye

and
fatigue
by
his
long
journey
,
Careless
sleep
very
soundly
,
and
awoke
in
well
spirit
than
he
have
feel
since
the
sad
catastrophe
in
the
gorge
of
the
Avon
.
 
<EOS>
on
descend
from
his

he
go
forth
upon
the
lawn
in

of

,
and
be
admire
the
range
of
magnificent

by
which
it
be
surround
,
when
Juliana
Coningsby
come
out
of
the

with
a
little
basket
of
flower
in
her
hand
,
and
trip
towards
him
with
a
light
footstep
across
the
smooth
greensward
.
 
<EOS>
if
Careless
have
be
strike
by
her
beauty
overnight
,
he
be
far
more
impressed
by
it
now
.
<EOS>
Her
figure
,
we
have
say
,
be
exceedingly
light
and
graceful
,
and
in
her
very
becoming
morning
costume
,
with
her
blonde
tress
hang
over
her
shoulder
,
and
her
fair
complexion
slightly
heighten
,
she
look
really
charming
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
persuade
himself
that
he
could
never
love
again
,
but
now
that
this
exquisite
creature
stand
before
him
,
and
greet
him
with
the
sweetest
smile
imaginable
,
and
in
accent
that
sound
melodiously
in
his
ear
,
he
begin
to
think
it
possible
he
may
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
formal
salutation
have
pass
between
them
<EOS>
,
she
say
:
 
"
do
you
know
,
Major
Careless
,
I
have
be
dream
all
night
of
the
king
's
romantic
adventure
,
which
you
relate
to
us
.
<EOS>
I
quite
envy
Jane
Lane
<EOS>
the
part
she
take
in
them
.
<EOS>
I
should
consider
it
the
great
privilege
to
attend
upon
his
majesty
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Jane
Lane
be
a
person
of
the
high
courage
,
full
of
ardour
and
zeal
for
the
royal
cause
,
"
reply
Careless
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
excuse
my
saying
that
very
few
of
your
sex
would
have
go
through
what
she
have
do
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
a
slight
shade
cross
his
feature
as
he
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
plain
you
think
I
could
not
do
as
much
,
"
say
Juliana
,
in
a
slight
tone
of
pique
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
be
certain
I
could
.
<EOS>
to
ride
on
a
pillion
behind
the
king
would
be
an
event
to
remember
all
one
's
life
.
<EOS>
Jane
Lane
must
feel
very
proud
.
<EOS>
be
she
good
-
look
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
remarkably
so
,
"
rejoin
Careless
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
see
very
few
person
who
can
compare
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
only
beautiful
but
full
of
spirit
.
<EOS>
but
you
will
see
her
,
for
she
be
come
here
with
the
king
.
<EOS>
Sir
Clement
Fisher
,
to
whom
she
be
betroth
,
will
form
one
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
Should
she
succeed
in
bring
his
majesty
safe
to
Trent
,
her
duty
will
be
at
an
end
,
and
you
can
then
,
if
you
think
proper
,
assume
her
post
.
<EOS>
the
king
,
I
be
sure
,
will
be
enchant
to
have
so
fair
a
companion
.
<EOS>
but
the
service
be
not
without
great
risk
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
would
be
no
excitement
in
it
--
<EOS>
no
honour
to
be
win
<EOS>
--
if
there
be
no
risk
,
"
she
rejoin
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
some
circumstance
may
occur
to
prove
that
I
be
not
inferior
to
Jane
Lane
.
"
 
while
thus
converse
,
they
have
move
to
a
part
of
the
lawn
from
which
the
church
be
visible
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
already
state
that
the
beautiful
old
structure
be
quite
close
to
the
mansion
,
and
indeed
a
narrow
road
only
divide
the
churchyard
from
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
"
though
the
church
be
so
near
to
us
,
and
contain
the
family
pew
,
"
say
Juliana
,
"
we
be
prevent
from
offer
our
devotion
within
it
.
<EOS>
the
worthy
rector
,
the
Reverend
Richard
Langton
,
have
be
deprive
of
his
benefice
,
and
have
be

Hand
Meldrum

for
so
he

,
may
be
a
very
good
man

we
none
of
us
care
to

<EOS>
We
have
prayer
at
home
,
and
Mr.
Langton
,
who
,
though
drive
from
the
rectory
,
still
reside
in
the
village
,
officiate
as
Colonel
Wyndham

domestic
chaplain

"
 
<EOS>
as
Careless
express
a
desire
to
inspect
the
sacred
edifice
,
with
which
he
be
much
strike
,
they
pass
out
at
a
small
gate
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
.
<EOS>
a
few
step
bring
them
to
the
entrance
to
the
churchyard
--
a
quiet
spot
,
full
of
grave
of
rounded
turf
.
<EOS>
on
the
left
of
the
churchyard
stand
the
old
rectory
,
now
occupy
by
the
Independent
minister
.
 
<EOS>
on
approach
the
church
they
find
the
door
open
and
walk
in
.
<EOS>
the
interior
of
the
old
fabric
be
as
beautiful
as
the
exterior
,
and
not
much
damage
have
be
do
to
its
monument
,
though
the
paint
glass
in
the
window
have
be
destroy
.
<EOS>
a
hasty
survey
of
the
chancel
suffice
for
Careless
.
<EOS>
as
they
return
through
the
churchyard
,
a
tall
,
sallow
-
complexioned
personage
,
in
a
black
gown
and
Geneva
band
,
could
be

"
the

Hand
Meldrum

say
Juliana
.
<EOS>
"
perhaps
it
would
have
be
more
prudent
in
you
not
to
come
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
matter
little
,
I
think
,
"
say
Careless
.
<EOS>
"
if
he
be
inquisitive
,
he
must
have
learn
that
a
stranger
have
arrive
at
the
manor
-
house

"
 
<EOS>
"
very
true
;
but
he
will
now
discover
from
your
attire
that
you
be
a
Cavalier
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
do
not
return
by
the
garden
,
but
enter
the
yard
,
which
we
have
describe
as
contiguous
to
the
church
.
 
<EOS>
here
they
find
Colonel
Wyndham

and
after

have
pass
between
Careless
and
his

,
they
proceed
to
the
stable
to
look
at

<EOS>
on

which
occupy
only
a

,
the

Careless
in
the

of
the
yard
,
and
bade
him
notice
the
upper

<EOS>
"
those

he
say

<EOS>
"

"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
lead
his
guest
to
a
deeply

arched
doorway
near
the
brewhouse
,
which
at
once
admit
them

Colonel

show

<EOS>
"

They

that

seize
the

have
give
abundant
proof
of
their
devotion

<EOS>
no

then
,
that
he
feel
unusually
cheerful

while

lively
sally

several

such

of
the
peace

prosperity
which
the

have
enjoy
during

he
add

that
if

would
inevitably
obtain
the
mastery

the
pillar
of

be
undermine

chapter

.
<EOS>
how
the
king
hear
the
PARTICULARS
of
his
own
DEATH
and
burial
 
<EOS>
the
party
ride
back
as
cheerfully
as
they
come
.
<EOS>
though
disappoint
by
the
result
of
the
interview
with
Sir
John
Strangways
,
Colonel
Wyndham
do
not
seem
discourage
,
but
say
he
have
another
plan
to
propose
to
his
majesty
.
<EOS>
however
,
an
unlooked
for
occurrence
have
take
place
during
their
absence
.
 
<EOS>
when
about
a
mile
from
Trent
,
they
be
greatly
surprised
by
hear
the
church
bell
re
out
a
loud
and
joyous
peal
.
<EOS>
mingle
with
these
sound
be
the
occasional
discharge
of
a
musket
.
 
<EOS>
what
could
have
happen
to
call
forth
such
manifestation
?
<EOS>
not
even
Colonel
Wyndham
could
conjecture
.
<EOS>
but
as
they
draw
near
the
village
,
they
learn
that
a
small
troop
of
Cromwell
's
horse
that
have
fight
at
Worcester
have
just
arrive
,
and
have
proclaim
the
utter
rout
of
the
royal
army
--
add
the
important
,
and
as
they
declare
authentic
intelligence
,
that
the
Malignant
Prince
himself
have
be
slay
,
and
bury
among
a
heap
of
his
misguided
follower
.
 
<EOS>
News
then
reach
a
retired
village
like
trent
so
slowly
,
that
only
vague
rumour
of
the
decisive
battle
have
be
hitherto
receive
.
<EOS>
but
here
be
man
who
,
have
fight
at
the
great
fight
,
could
not
be
discredit
.
 
<EOS>
the
inhabitant
of
Trent
,
most
of
whom
be
fanatic
,
be
greatly
elate
by
the
news
,
and
desire
to
have
the
bell
rung
,
and
to
this
their
minister
willingly
assent
.
<EOS>
They
be
also
prepare
to
feast
the
victorious
trooper

other
rejoicing
.
 
<EOS>
Charles
laugh
when
he
learn
these
particular
of
his
own
death
and
burial
and
not
unreasonably
think
that
further
search
for
him
be
not
likely
to
be
make
in
this
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
go
on
,
they
find
that
the
church
-
yard
be
fill
by
the
villager
,
while
a
score
or
more
red

have
tie
up

and
be
now
regale
themselves
on
the
cold
viand
and
ale
with
which
they
have
compel
Mrs.
Wyndham
to
supply
them
.
 
<EOS>
His
house
be
thus
in
the
hand
of
the
enemy
,
it
behove
Colonel
Wyndham
to
be
careful
how
he
approach
it
,
but
Peters
meet
him
before
he
reach
the
gate
,
and
hastily
explain
what
have
happen
,
tell
him
the
red
-
coat
have
behave
quietly
enough
as
yet
,
and
would
no
doubt
depart
peaceably
if
they
be
not
thwart

<EOS>
act
on
this
advice
,
the
colonel
,
on
enter
the
yard
,
address
a
few
word
to
the
soldier
,
tell
them
he
be
glad
to
see
them
,
and
add
that
they
should
have
as
much
ale
as
they
like
.
<EOS>
the
prudence
of
this
course
be
soon
show
.
<EOS>
the
man
thank
him
,
and
allow
him
and
Careless
to
pass
on
unquestioned
,
but
Charles
be
not
quite
so
lucky
.
<EOS>
a
stalwart
trooper
lay
hold
of
his
bridle
,
and
declare
he
must
give
an
account

be
in
great
consternation
at

visit

but
owe

the
prudent
and
conciliatory
measure
adopt
by
Harry

the
annoyance
be
very
slight

<EOS>
some
of
the

but
they
do
not

where
they
be

Charles

he
comport
himself
so
well
that
no

how

he
emphatically
declare

later
on

the

<EOS>
exhilarate
by
the
sea

,
Colonel
Wyndham
and
Careless
greatly
enjoy
their
ride
over
the
hard
,
dry
sand
--
now
glance
at
the
tall
,
black
,
shelving
cliff
as
they
pass
them
--
now
allow
their
gaze
to
wander
on
as
far
as
the
distant
Isle
of
Portland
.
<EOS>
but
their
pleasant
ride
soon
come
to
an
end
,
and
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
have
reach
the
spot
where
the
little
river
Char
lose
itself
in
the
sea

<EOS>
three

four

draw
upon

there
be
not

<EOS>
now
-
a

day
,
this

<EOS>
"
I
have
bring
you
to
this
spot
for
a
particular
reason
,
"
observe
Captain
Ellesdon
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
here
Sir
John
Berkeley
take
boat
on
the
night
when
he

his
escape
to
France
,
and
if
we
arrange
matter
satisfactorily
,
I
propose
that
his
majesty
shall
join
Limbry
's
bark
from
the
same
place
.
<EOS>
no
safe
spot
can
be
find
,
I
be
certain
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a

Tis
as
private
as
could

I
be

his

approve
of

other
advantage

the

sufficient
recommendation

Careless
.
<EOS>
"
if
we
can
secure
the
vessel
all
will
be
well

"
 
<EOS>
They
then
quit
the
beach
,
and
ride
singly
along
a
narrow
lane
which
lead
them
over
an
eminence
to
Charmouth
.
 
<EOS>
this
pretty
and
pleasantly
situate
little
town
be
much
change
since
those
day

<EOS>
Most
of
the
old
house
be
go
,
and
have
give
place
to
modern
habitation
far
less
picturesque
,
but
the
general
feature
of
the
place
be
the
same
,
and
the
old
inn
at
which
the
Royalists
put
up
,
as
we
shall
proceed
to
relate
,
be
still
in
existence
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
enter
the
village
,
Captain
Ellesdon
point
out
a
pretty
little
house
with
a
garden
in
front
,
and
say
:
 
"
that
be
Limbry

dwelling
.
<EOS>
I
will
see
whether

"
 
<EOS>
He

ride
towards
the
house
,
and
call
out
lustily
,
the
summon
be
immediately
answer
by
a
buxom
woman
and
her
daughter
,
a
good-
look
damsel
of
some
sixteen
or
seventeen

<EOS>
in
answer
to
the
captain
's
inquiry
,
Dame
Limbry
inform
him
that
her

have
just
go
out
,
but
would
return
presently
.
 
<EOS>
"
He

I
hope
?
"
say
the
captain
.
 
<EOS>
"
no

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
Dame

promise
compliance

and
the
captain
ride
off

<EOS>
not
be
devoid
of
curiosity
,
both
mother
and
daughter
watch
the
party
alight
at
the
inn
,
which
be
close
at

<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
Captain
Ellesdon
's
important
business
can
be
,
"
remark
Dame
Limbry
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
make
your
father
tell
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
such
fine
gentleman
as
those

not

"
say
her
daughter

<EOS>
"
They
look

cavalier

"
 
<EOS>
"

Cavaliers

Dorcas

<EOS>
meanwhile

<EOS>
the

stoutly

and
his
bronze
complexion
show
that
he
have
undergo
a
good
deal
of
exposure
to

<EOS>
His

good

<EOS>
salute

after
their
negotiation
with
Limbry
have
be
so
satisfactorily
conclude

pay
their
reckoning
,
and
depart

<EOS>
They

Captain
Ellesdon

farm

house

to
his
father

about
a
mile
and
a
half
off
among

<EOS>
I
will
come
there
early
on

<EOS>
I
have
likewise
just
bethought
me

consequently

the

engage

His

if
they

the
house
at
that
late
hour

suspicion
may
be
excite

some
pretext

therefore
,
must
be
find
to
satisfy
Dame
Swan

very

I
will
send
my
servant

Harry

they

be
most
happy
to
inform
his
majesty
that
everything
be
go
on
well
.
<EOS>
not
an
hour
ago
,
he
have
see
Limbry
,
and
have
learn
that
the
Eider
Duck
be
already
victual
,
and
out
of
the
Cobb
,
and
would
be
quite
ready
to
set
sail
at
midnight
,
as
soon
as
the
passenger
be
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
seaman
have
be
give
to
understand
,
"
pursue
Captain
Ellesdon
,
"
that
the
reason
why
the
passenger
embark
at
Charmouth
at
such
an
unseasonable
hour
,
and
not
at
Lyme
,
be
,
that
they
fear
an
arrest
,
their
factor
at
St.
Malo
have
detain
their
good
,
which
they
trust
to
recover
by
appear
in
person
against
him
.
<EOS>
with
this
explanation
the
seaman
be
perfectly
satisfied
,
and
a
few
gold
piece
on
your
majesty
's
arrival
at
St.
Malo
will
effectually
seal
their
lip
.
<EOS>
as
the
wind
be
fair
,
I
think
your
majesty
may
calculate
on
a
prosperous
voyage
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
doubt
be
inform
that
a
large
fair
be
hold
in
Lyme
today
.
<EOS>
advantage
have
be
take
of
the
meeting
by
the
mayor
of
the
town
to
publicly
read
the
Proclamation
make
by
the
Men
of
Westminster
,
offer
a
reward
of
a
Thousand
Pounds
for
the
discovery
of
your
majesty
,
with
the
penalty
of
death
against
all
who
shall
conceal
you
.
<EOS>
I
be
rejoice
to
think
that
the
Eider
Duck
be
out
of
port
,
so
that
the
seaman
will
not
be
likely
to
hear
of
the
notice
;
and
I
be
still
better
pleased
to
find
that
our
staunch
shipmaster
appear
to
care
little
about
it
.
<EOS>
Your
majesty
will
be
off
before
any
mischief
can
be
do
.
<EOS>
as
it
turn
out
,
it
would
have
be
quite
impossible
for
you
to
embark
at
Lyme
,
since
Captain
Macy
have
just
arrive
there
with
a
regiment
of
horse
,
and
his
man
be
spread
about
the
town
,
and
the
inn
and
ale
-
house
be
full
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
must
also
put
your
majesty
on
your
guard
against
Reuben
Rufford
,
the
ostler
at
the
little
inn
at
Charmouth
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
Roundhead
,
and
a
notorious
knave
,
as
I
have
discover
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
observe
all
due
caution
in
regard
to
the
rascal
,
"
say
the
king
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
as
my
stay
at
Charmouth
will
be
so
short
,
I
do
not
think
there
be
much
to
fear
from
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
some
further
conversation
then
take
place
,
at
the
close
of
which
the
king
reiterate
his
thank
to
Captain
Ellesdon
,
and
present
him
with
a
piece
of
gold
,
through
which
a
hole
have
be
drill
,
so
that
it
could
be
wear
,
bid
him
keep
it
as
an
earnest
of
what
he
would
do
for
him
hereafter
,
should
well
day
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
"
most
assuredly
those
day
will
arrive
,
sire
,
"
say
the
captain
;
"
but
I
desire
no
great
reward
for
my
service
than
that
which
I
have
now
receive
.
<EOS>
I
shall
always
wear
this
medal
next
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
to
detain
him
longer
at
the
farm
-
house
,
the
king
now
give
the
word
for
departure
,
and
all
his
attendant
mount
their
horse
.
<EOS>
Captain
Ellesdon
ride
by
his
majesty
's
side
,
and
conduct
him
to
the
summit
of
the
steep
hill
that
rise
between
Charmouth
and
Lyme
;
point
out
the
Eider
Duck
,
lie
off
the
mouth
of
the
Cobb
,
as
well
as
the
exact
spot
where
it
have
be
arrange
that
the
long
-
boat
should
fetch
his
majesty
and
his
companion
at
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
from
this
elevated
point
Lyme
seem
immediately
beneath
them
,
and
the
king
could
clearly
perceive
the
crowd
in
the
principal
street
,
as
well
as
hear
the
shout
and
other
noise
that
arise
from
the
fair
.
<EOS>
amid
the
throng
he
notice
that
many
red
-
coat
be
mingle
.
<EOS>
from
the
church
tower
float
the
flag
of
the
Commonwealth
.
 
<EOS>
satisfied
at
last
with
the
survey
,
Charles
bade
farewell
to
Captain
Ellesdon
,
and
with
his
attendant
ride
down
the
left
side
of
the
declivity
to
Charmouth
,
while
the
captain
take
his
way
on
the
right
to
Lyme
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
approach
the
little
town
,
Charles
ask
Juliana
if
she
be
quite
prepared
for
the
part
she
have
to
play
,
and
receive
a
laugh
response
in
the
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
Harry
Peters
have
ride
on
beforehand
,
so
that
when
the
party
arrive
at
the
little
inn
,
the
hostess
,
with
the
ostler
and
all
the
servant
,
be
at
the
door
ready
to
receive
them
.
 
<EOS>
luckily
,
most
of
the
villager
be
at
Lyme
fair
,
or
there
would
have
be
a
little
crowd
collect
to
gaze
at
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
so
dazzle
be
Dame
Swan
by
Juliana
's
beauty
,
as
she
assist
the
young
lady
to
alight
,
that
she
could
look
at
no
one
else
,
but
when
she
do
bestow
a
glance
on
the
king
<EOS>
she
do
not
think
him
half
handsome
enough
to
be
the
husband
of
such
a
charming
creature
.
 
<EOS>
lead
Juliana
into
a
parlour
,
where
a
cold
collation
be
lay
out
,
the
good
dame
kiss
her
and
wish

<EOS>
They
be
follow
by
Charles
,
who
laughingly
inquire
if
the
hostess
mean
to
rob
him
of
his
intend
bride
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
rob
you
of

,
sir
,
"
reply
Dame
Swan
;
"
and
I
will
do
my
good
to
prevent
any
one
else
from
take
her
from
you
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
sir
,
you
ought
to
esteem
yourself
the
lucky
man
on
earth
to
have
obtain
such
a
treasure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
so
I
do
,
dame
.
<EOS>
but
be
she
not
the
lucky
woman
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
think
myself
so
,
"
say
Juliana
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
a
very
bad
judge
,
"
remark
the
hostess
.
<EOS>
"
I
often
say
to
myself
,
'
It
be
very
well
<EOS>
we

not
all
of
one
mind

<EOS>
what
suit
one
person

not
suit
another

'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
clear
<EOS>
I
do
not
suit
your
fancy

"
cry
Charles
,
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
here
they
be
interrupt
by
the
entrance
of
the
rest
of
the
party
,
and
they
all
on
the
king
's
invitation
sit
down
to
the
repast
--
Juliana
,
of
course
,
be
seat
beside
his
majesty
,
and
receive
particular
attention
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
Careless
sit
on
the
other
side
of
the
young
damsel
,
who
do
not
seem
displeased
to
have
him
near
her
,
but
chat
with
him
very
gaily
.
<EOS>
and
the
hostess
subsequently
remark
to
Harry
Peters
,
who
have
assist
her
to
wait
on
the
company
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
have
be
surprise
if
that
lovely
creature
have
run
away
with
the
gallant
-
look
Cavalier
on
her
right
,
and
I
almost
think
she
prefer
him
to
the
accepted
suitor
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
too
late
yet
for
her
to
change
her
mind

"
 
<EOS>
"

her
opinion
when
Careless
and
Juliana
walk

She

in
very
tender

be
just
about

Quite

You
quickly
perceive
that
I
want
some
necessary
qualification

this
charming

have
make
a

a

liberty

excusable

under
the
circumstance

you

"
<EOS>
yes

I
play
my

so
indifferently

"
Nay

the
WATCHERS
by
the
sea
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
most
of
the
inhabitant
of
the
little
town
who
have
be
at
Lyme
fair
have
return
,
and
a
great
number
of
them
flock
to
the
inn
,
and
make
so
much
disturbance
,
that
the
hostess
be
fain
to
serve
them
,
but
she
would
not
let
them
into
the
parlour
,
and
after
they
have
empty
a
few
pot
of
cider
--
that
be
the
liquor
for
which
Charmouth
be
renowned
--
they
quietly
depart
.
 
<EOS>
half
an
hour
later
,
every
house
in
the
village
--
except
the
little
inn
,
be
closed
--
and
its
inmate
have
apparently
retire
to
rest
,
since
not
a
light
could
be
see
in
any
of
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
to
avoid
any
chance
of
danger
to
his
majesty
,
it
have
be
arrange
that
Colonel
Wyndham
,
attend
by
Harry
Peters
,
should
ride
to
the
mouth
of
the
Char
about
an
hour
before
midnight
,
and
there
await
the
long
-
boat
.
<EOS>
on
its
arrival
,
Peters
be
to
gallop
back
and
give
information
to
the
king
,
who
would
be
prepare
to
start
on
the
instant
with
his
companion
for
the
place
of
rendezvous
.
<EOS>
the
horse
would
be
ready
saddle
,
so
that
no
delay
could
occur
.
 
<EOS>
soon
after
eleven
o'clock
,
the
colonel
,
have
receive
his
majesty
's
last
command
,
prepare
to
set
out
.
<EOS>
Reuben
Rufford
,
the
ostler
,
bring
out
the
horse
,
and
both
the
colonel
and
Harry
Peters
notice
that
the
fellow
appear
very
inquisitive
,
and
hold
up
his
lantern
,
so
as
to
throw
its
light
on
their
face
.
<EOS>
when
they
be
go
,
Reuben
observe
to
his
mistress
that
he
think
they
could
be
<EOS>
about
no
good
,
<EOS>
but
she
rebuke
him
sharply
,
and
he
go
back
to
the
stable
.
 
<EOS>
ride
singly
along
the
narrow
green
lane
,
already
describe
as
lead
to
the
sea
-
shore
,
Colonel
Wyndham
and
Peters
presently
arrive
at
the
mouth
of
the
Char
.
 
<EOS>
the
place
be
perfectly
solitary
.
<EOS>
They
have
encounter
no
one
in
the
lane
,
and
no
one
be
to
be
see
on
the
beach
.
<EOS>
the
only
sound
that
could
be
hear
be
that
of
the
wave
break
on
the
sandy
shore
.
<EOS>
It
be
within
half
an
hour
of
high
water
,
and
the
tide
be
flow
rapidly
.
 
<EOS>
the
night
be
dark
,
but
clear
,
and
they
look
out
for
the
Eider
Duck
,
and
fancy
they
could
distinguish
her
in
the
offing
,
about
a
mile
out
.
<EOS>
a
light
could
be
see
at
the
head
of
Lyme
Cobb
,
which
look
like
a
huge
black
ship
moor
to
the
shore
.
<EOS>
the
dark
sloping
cliff
be
wrap
in
gloom
,
but
nothing
be
to
be
fear
in
that
direction
,
for
the
road
along
the
beach
be
impassable
in
this
state
of
the
tide
.
 
<EOS>
for
some
time
the
watcher
remain
with
their
gaze
fix
upon
the
sea
,
hope
to
descry
the
boat
,
anxiously
listen
for
the
sound
of
oar
.
<EOS>
They
hear
nothing
except
the
wearisome
and
monotonous
sound
of
the
wave
.
 
<EOS>
Hitherto
scarcely
a
word
have
pass
between
them
,
but
now
the
colonel
could
not
help
express
astonishment
that
the
boat
do
not
make
its
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
a
little
patience
,
sir
,
"
say
Peters
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
soon
be
here
,
I
will
warrant
you
.
<EOS>
Stephen
Limbry
will
not
prove
false
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
"
say
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
"
Hark
!
'
<EOS>
tis
the
hour
!
"
 
<EOS>
as
he
speak
a
distant
bell
strike
twelve
,
so
slowly
that
in
the
deep
stillness
the
stroke
could
be
count
.
 
<EOS>
the
appoint
hour
have
come
,
but
no
boat
come
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
in
vain
the
colonel
and
his
servant
strain
their
gaze
towards
the
spot
where
they
suppose
the
boat
be
lie
.
<EOS>
no
boat
could
be
see
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
they
fancy
they
could
descry
it
,
but
the
delusive
object
,
whatever
it
may
be
,
quickly
vanish
.
 
<EOS>
another
hour
pass
by
,
and
find
them
at
their
post
,
still
gaze
at
the
sea
,
still
hope
the
boat
would
come
,
vainly
hope
,
as
it
prove
.
 
<EOS>
the
tide
have
turn
,
but
have
not
yet
perceptibly
recede
.
 
<EOS>
though
staggered
and
uneasy
,
Colonel
Wyndham
have
not
lose
faith
in
the
shipmaster
.
 
<EOS>
"
Should
Limbry
turn
out
a
traitor
,
I
will
never
trust
man
again
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
perhaps
the
seaman
have
go
ashore
to
the
fair
,
colonel
,
and
he
have
not
be
able
to
get
them
back
again
,
"
rejoin
Peters
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
delay
be
unaccountable
,
"
cry
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
majesty
will
be
distract
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
ride
back
,
and
inform
him
that
no
boat
have
yet
come
ashore
?
"
say
Peters
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
would
make
matter
bad
,
"
rejoin
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
stay
till
you
can
take
him
good
news
.
<EOS>
"
They
wait
for
another
hour
,
and
for
an
hour
after
that
,
patiently
--
strive
to
persuade
themselves
that
the
boat
would
still
come
.
 
<EOS>
the
tide
have
now
retreat
to
a
considerable
distance
,
the
colonel
ride
upon
the
sand
,
and
dash
into
the
water
in
his
anxiety
to
discern
the
object
he
so
fruitlessly
seek
.
 
<EOS>
no
boat
meet
his
gaze
;
and
the
sky
have
become
clouded
,
the
sea
look
dark
and
sullen
.
<EOS>
His
own
breast
be
full
of
sombre
thought
.
<EOS>
the
hope
that
have
animate
him
a
few
hour
ago
be
go
,
and
have
give
place
to
bitter
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
though
his
hope
be
crush
,
he
cling
despairingly
to
his
post
,
nor
would
he
quit
it
,
or
allow
Peters
to
depart
,
till
day
break
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
first
streak
of
dawn
fall
upon
the
sea
,
he
look
out
for
the
treacherous
bark
,
and
beheld
her
lie
within
half
a
mile
of
the
Cobb
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
quit
her
position
since
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
useless
to
tarry
longer
.
<EOS>
even
if
the
boat
be
send
now
it
would
be
impossible
to
embark
in
it
at
low
water
.
<EOS>
Bidding
Peters
follow
him
,
and
in
a
state
of
mind
border
on
distraction
,
he
ride
along
the
lane
to
Charmouth
.
 
<EOS>
but
how
could
he
face
the
king
?

<EOS>
how
the
GREY
mare
prove
the
BETTER
horse
 
<EOS>
Limbry
be
not
altogether
in
fault
,
though
appearance
be
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
like
many
other
man
,
he
be
under
the
governance
of
his
spouse

<EOS>
and
,
as
we
shall
now
proceed
to
show
,
it
be
owe
to
Dame
Limbry
that
the
king
's
well
-
plan
escape
to
France
be
frustrate
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
remember
that
she
have
express
to
her
daughter
a
resolution
to
ascertain
the
nature
of
the
important
business
on
which
Captain
Ellesdon
and
the
two
Cavaliers
desire
to
see
Limbry
at
the
inn
.
<EOS>
but
she
do
not
succeed
.
<EOS>
strange
to
say
,
the
shipmaster
for
once
keep
his
own
counsel
,
and
this
unwonted
reticence
on
his
part
only
serve
to
inflame
his
wife
's
curiosity
the
more
.
<EOS>
feel
his
inequality
in
a
contest
with
such
a
determined
woman
,
Limbry
show
his
discretion
by
keep
out
of
her
way
as
much
as
possible
,
and
do
not
even
acquaint
her
with
his
intention
to
go
to
sea
;
but
desirous
to
propitiate
her
,
he
urge
her
to
take
her
daughter
to
Lyme
fair
.
<EOS>
as
it
turn
out
,
he
could
not
have
act
more
injudiciously
.
<EOS>
while
at
the
fair
,
Dame
Limbry
hear
the
terrible
Proclamation
,
and
a
suspicion
immediately
cross
her
that
the
two
gentleman
she
have
see
be
fugitive
Cavaliers
from
Worcester
.
<EOS>
the
suspicion
be
convert
into
certainty
,
when
about
nine
o'clock
at
night
,
just
after
she
and
her
daughter
have
return
from
Lyme
,
Limbry
,
who
have
be
absent
from
home
all
day
,
come
in
,
and
instead
of
sit
down
like
a
good
husband
and
father
to
chat
with
them
,
go
up
-
stair
at
once
to
his
own
room
,
in
order
to
pack
up
some
linen
.
 
<EOS>
while
he
be
thus
employ
,
his
wife
,
who
have
follow
him
,
enter
the
room
,
close
the
door
,
and
put
on
an
injured
expression
of
countenance
,
which
she
know
so
well
how
to
assume
,
ask
him
,
in
a
tone
that
make
him
quake
,
what
he
be
about

<EOS>
"
surely
,
you
be
not
go
to

<EOS>
"
yes
I

he
reply
,
find
further
concealment
impossible

"
<EOS>
My
landlord
,
Captain
Ellesdon
,
have
provide
me
with
a
freight
which
will
be
worth
infinitely
more
to
me
than
if
the
Eider
Duck

laden

distrust
your

I
may
tell
you
that

on

I
shall
receive

instead
of
appear
pleased
,
and
congratulate
him
as
he
expect
on
his
good
fortune
,
with
a
countenance
inflame
with
anger
,
his

scream
out
:

"
I
know
it

<EOS>
I
feel
quite
certain
you
be
about
to
transport
some
Royalists
to

perhaps
the
malignant
Prince

I
hear

up
his
intended
voyage

<EOS>
after
some
little
demur
,
and
another
attempt
at
coax
,
which
prove
unsuccessful
,
he
assent
,
and
give
the
required
promise
,
but
he
add
that
he
must
go
down
to
the
sea
-
side
and
inform
the
gentleman
who
be
wait
for
him

<EOS>
thereupon
,
the
door
be
open

and
Limbry
prepare
to
set
out
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
rather
doubt
his
design
,
notwithstanding
the
solemn
promise
he
have
just
give
,
his
vigilant
spouse
would
not
allow
him
to
go
alone
,
but
follow
him
closely
with
her
daughter
,
and
they
be
proceed
along
the
narrow
lane
lead
to
the
sea
,
when
they
meet
Colonel
Wyndham
and
his
servant

<EOS>
the
colonel
could
not
fail
to
be
strike
by
Limbry
's
downcast
look
,
and
he
be
also
surprised
to
see
him
attend
by
the
two
woman
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
too
exasperate
to
heed
their
presence
.
 
<EOS>
"
treacherous
rascal
!
"
<EOS>
he
vociferate
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
art
thou
not
ashamed
to

me
in
the
face
after

thy
engagement

<EOS>
I
have
be

<EOS>
how
dost

to
justify
thy
scandalous
conduct

<EOS>
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
justify
it
,
sir

"

Limbry
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
make
a
prisoner
in
my
own
house

"
 
<EOS>
"
an
idle
story
!

exclaim
Colonel
Wyndham
,
incredulously

<EOS>
"
'
Tis
the
truth

"
cry
Dame
Limbry
,
step
forward
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
my
foolish
husband
be
run
his
neck
into
a
noose
,
so
I
lock
him
up
to
save
him
.
<EOS>
do
not
tempt
him
to
sail
,
or
as
sure
as
I

a
live
woman

I
will
inform
against

<EOS>
"

not

thee
into

he
add
to
Limbry

<EOS>
so
say
he
ride
past
them
,
and
make
his
way
towards
the
inn
.
 
<EOS>
arrive
there
,
he
despatch
Peters

the
REVEREND
BARTHOLOMEW
WESLEY
 
<EOS>
on
enter
the
house
the
colonel
find
Charles
and
his
attendant
in
a
state
of
the
great
anxiety
.
<EOS>
His
look
announce
the
ill
-
tiding
he
bring
;
and
it
be
scarcely
necessary
for
him
to
relate
what
have
happen
.
<EOS>
the
king
bear
the
grievous
disappointment
better
than
may
have
be
expect
,
but
he
could
not
wholly
repress
his
feeling
of
vexation
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
I
have
have
to
do
with
a
man
of
mettle
,
master
in
his
own
house
,
as
well
as
master
of

I
should
have
be
half

way
across
the
English
Channel
by
this
time

"
he
cry

<EOS>
"
fate
thwart
me
at
every
turn
;
but
I
will
not
be
cast
down
.
<EOS>
We
shall
hear
what
Captain
Ellesdon
say
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
may
be
able
to
find
me
another
vessel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
after
what
have
occur
,
I
do
not
think
it
will
be
safe
for
your
majesty
to
remain
here
,
"
say
Colonel
Wyndham
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Limbry
's
wife
will
probably
publish
all
she
know
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
do
not
like
the
look
of
the
ostler
.
<EOS>
the
knave
eye
me
suspiciously
as
I
give
him
my
horse
just
now
,
and
mutter
something
about
my
be
out
all
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
where
would
you
have
me
go
?
<EOS>
what
would
you
have
me
do
?
"
cry
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
"
perhaps
Captain
Ellesdon
may
suggest
some
plan
,
"
say
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
hear
when
Peters
return
;
but
my
notion
be
that
your
majesty
should
ride
on
to
Bridport
.
<EOS>
You
may
have
well
luck
there
than
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My

have
cast
a

Lord
Wilmot

rise
to
quit
the

<EOS>
"
if
we
be
go
to

immediately
,
I
must
send
him
to
a
smith

"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
go
out
,
and
proceed
to
the
stable
,
give
the
ostler
the
necessary
instruction
.
<EOS>
like
Colonel
Wyndham
,
he
be
strike
with
the
man
's
inquisitive
manner

and
decline
to
have
any
conversation
with
him

<EOS>
"
I
can
not

these
folk
out

Reuben

<EOS>
"
there
be
the
strange
going

<EOS>
Tis
my
belief
<EOS>
they
be
a
pack
of
malignant
try
to
escape
;
but
I
will
soon
find
it
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
thus
ruminate
,
and
consider
what
reward
he
should
obtain
for
give
information
against
his
mistress

guest
,
he
take
Lord
Wilmot
's
horse
to
a
blacksmith
,
name
Seth
Hammet
,
whose
smithy
be
in
the
low
part
of

village

<EOS>
bid
the
smith
good
morrow

he
tell
him
he
have
bring
him
a
job

<EOS>
Seth
Hammet
,
who
be
a
sharp

look
young
man
,
thank
him

but
be
of
an
inquisitive
turn

he
add
,
"
You

some
gentlefolk
at

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay

ay

reply
Reuben

not
desire

into

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this

"
 
<EOS>
"
a
fine
horse
,
"
observe
Hammet
,
look
at
him
admiringly
.
<EOS>
"
but
they
all
seem
well
mount

<EOS>
where
do
they
come
from

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
happen

reply
Reuben
,
in
a
tone
mean
to
signify
that
he
do
not
feel
inclined
to
tell

<EOS>
"
somewhere
in
Devonshire
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
can
easily

observe
Hammet
,
with
a
knowing

<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to

surprised

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
"
if

<EOS>
"
bless
you

<EOS>
there
be
no

'
<EOS>
Tis
the
simple
thing
possible

as
you
will
see

<EOS>
two
of
your

have
be
out
all

"
 
<EOS>
"
how
do
you

ask
Reuben
.
 
<EOS>
"
because
I
see
them
return
,
not
half
an
hour
ago
.
<EOS>
the
servant
ride
on
to
Lyme
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
of
it
,
for
I
hear
his
master
tell
him
to
go
on
to
Captain
Ellesdon
's
house
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
indeed
!
"
exclaim
the
ostler
,
surprised

<EOS>
"
yes
,
you
do
not

Reuben

"
say
the
smith
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
now
let
us
proceed
to
business

"
 
<EOS>
thereupon
,
he
take
up
the
horse
's
foot
,
and
examine
the
shoe
,
twice
over
,
very
deliberately
.
<EOS>
after
the
second
examination
,
he
say
,
with
a
grin
:
 
<EOS>
"
now
,
Reuben
,
I
can
tell
you
something
that
will
surprise
you
.
<EOS>
this
horse
have
only
three
shoe

as
you
know

<EOS>
each
shoe
have
be
put
on
in
a
different
county

Somerset
,
Stafford
,
Worcester

"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
say
Worcester
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Reuben
.
 
<EOS>
"
look
here
,
"
reply
Hammet
,
lift
up
one
of
the
horse
's
fore
-
foot
.
"
<EOS>
that
shoe
come
from
Worcester
.
<EOS>
now
,
do
not
you
think
I
be
a
conjurer
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
to
think
,
"
reply
Reuben
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
seem
as
if
something
have
suddenly
strike
him
,
for
he
say
rather
hastily
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
stay
any
longer
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
our
minister
,
Mr.
Wesley
;
I
will
come
back
for
the
horse
presently
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
run
off
to
Mr.
Wesley
's
dwelling
,
which
be
at
no
great
distance
,
but
he
find
that
the
minister
be
at
prayer
with
his
family
,
and
know
from
experience
that
the
reverend
gentleman
's
discourse
be
rather
lengthy
,
he
would
not
wait
,
but
go
on
to
the
inn
.
 
<EOS>
during
his
absence
Harry
Peters
,
who
have
gallop
there
and
back
,
have
return
from
Lyme

and
be

<EOS>
Peters
have
see
Captain
Ellesdon

who
be
quite
confound
to
hear
of
the
failure
of
the
plan
,
have
persuade
himself
that
his
majesty
be
then
on
the
way
to
St.
Malo

<EOS>
"
never
in
my
life
have
I
see
a
man
so
greatly
troubled
as
the
captain
appear
,
"
say
Peters
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
humbly
tender
his
advice
to
your
majesty
not
to
make
any
longer
stay
in
Charmouth
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
ride
over
to
offer
his
counsel
in
person
,
and
urge
your
immediate
departure
,
have
it
be
safe
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
rumour
,
he
say
,
be
sure
to
be
bruit
abroad
,
which
will
infallibly
lead
to
strict
search
and
pursuit
by
Captain
Macy

"
 
<EOS>
Captain
Ellesdon
's
counsel
so
completely
coincide
with
the
opinion
previously
express
by
Colonel
Wyndham
and
his
other
adherent
,
that
the
king
determine
to
act
upon
it
,
and
preparation

he
rejoin

what

person
whom
both
his
majesty

as
have

delightfully
situate

on
in

and
enter
the
town
,
to
his
infinite
surprise
and
vexation

whatever
the
consequence
may

he
would
keep

he
at

They
scrutinise
the
traveller
as
they
go
by

do
not

<EOS>
the
sight
of
so
many
of

Colonel

hurry
to

pillion

and
attend
by
the
colonel

at
a
rapid
pace
towards
Bridport

<EOS>
when
they
be
within
half
a
mile
of

they
come
to
a
road
that
turn
off
on
the
right

be
debate
whether
to
pursue
it
or
go
on

when
they
hear
the
clatter
of
a
horse

foot
,
and
the
next
moment
beheld
Peters
gallop
towards
them

<EOS>
the
faithful
fellow
sign
to
them
to
turn
off

with
such
energy
of
action
that
they
instantly
obey

but
be
surprised
to
find
he
do
not
follow
them
,
but
go
on
at
the
same
swift
pace
towards
the
harbour
.
<EOS>
His
object
,
however
,
be
soon
apparent
.
<EOS>
the
heavy
trampling
of
a
troop
of
horse
be
hear
,
mingle
with
the
clank
of
sword
,
and
the
next
moment
a
detachment
of
cavalry
dash
past
,
evidently
in
pursuit
of
the
fugitive
,
who
have
thus
contrive
to
draw
them
on
,
put
his
own
life
in
jeopardy
to
preserve
the

<EOS>
though
Charles

be

by
a
turn
of
the
road

he
clearly
distinguish
the
trooper
,
and
feel
sure
that
their
leader

Captain

scarcely
know
which

but
fear
to
pass
through
Bridport
,
lest
they
should
be
stop
,
they
ride
on
to
a
pretty
little
village
call
Bothenhampton
,
and
there
inquire
the
road
to
Dorchester
.
<EOS>
the
person
to
whom
the
king
address
this
inquiry
,
stare
,
and
tell
him
he
must
go
back
through
Bridport
,
but
Charles
decline
,
and
they
ride
on
to
Shipton
Gorge
,
above
which
be
a
remarkable
hill
shape
like
a
ship
turn
keel
upwards
,
with
a
beacon
on
the
summit
,
and
be
direct
to
proceed
to
Hammerdon
Hill
,
and
this
course
they
take
.
 
<EOS>
have
cross
a
high
range
of
furze
-
cover
down
,
and
traverse
a
broad
common
,
they
be
approach
Winterborne
Abbas
,
when
they
descry
their
pursuer
come
down
the
hill
they
have
just
descend
.
<EOS>
Captain
Macy
,
no
doubt
,
have
hear
of
the
inquiry
make
by
the
king
as
to
the
road
to
Dorchester
,
and
have
follow
in
that
direction
.
 
<EOS>
fortunately
,
a
coppice
be
at
hand
,
and
the
fugitive
manage
to
conceal
themselves
within
it
,
till
their
pursuer
have
pass
.
<EOS>
so
near
be
the
trooper
that
the
king
could
hear
their
shout
,
announce
that
they
feel
certain
of
find
him
at
Dorchester
.
<EOS>
after
this
,
Charles
require
little
persuasion
to
induce
him
to
take
a
different
course
,
though
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
altogether
to
quit
the
coast
.
 
<EOS>
have
gain
the
roman
road
which
once
lead
to
Dorchester
,
they
proceed
along
it
in
the
opposite
direction
,
towards
a
fine
down
know
as
Eggardon
Hill
,
the
summit
of
which
be
crown
by
an
ancient
camp
,
with
very
remarkable
intrenchment
.
<EOS>
Thence
they
proceed
through
the
down
and
along
the
beautiful
valley
of
the
Brit
towards
Beaminster
.
 
<EOS>
some
seven
year
previously
,
Beaminster
be
a
flourishing
and
cheerful
little
town
,
but
it
now
look
like
a
collection
of
ruin
,
have
nearly
be
burn
down
in
1644
,
during
the
Civil
War
,
and
it
have
only
be
partially
rebuild
.
<EOS>
Charles
be
so
strike
by
the
melancholy
aspect
of
the
place
that
he
would
not
halt
there
as
he
intend
,
but
proceed
to
Broad
Windsor
,
which
be
about
three
mile
distant
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
road
thither
,
they
descry
three
person

horseback
on
the
summit
of
a
high
conical
hill

call

<EOS>
evidently
,
these

have
station
themselves
on

<EOS>
Juliana
declare

somewhat
more

It

He

where
he
encounter

have
gallop

<EOS>
at
this

"
say
his

"
after
a
brief
consultation
,
we
determine
to
proceed
to
Trent

as
we
could
not
doubt
that
you
would
soon
find
your

<EOS>
so
we
ride
on
to
Netherbury

Stoke
abbot

<EOS>
by
Careless

we
then
mount
this

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
More

"
reply
Wilmot
.
<EOS>
"
I
confess
I
think
it
useless
to
remain
so
long
,
but
Careless
judge
better
,
and
be
loth
to
depart
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a

"
say
Careless

<EOS>
"
I

I

Hadst

with
the
comfortable
appearance
of
the

that
he
resolve
to
pass
the

there

bade
the

secure
all

<EOS>
all
the

be
so
wearied

enchant
at

Lyme

arrive
in

demand
quarter
at

<EOS>
Poor
Rice

humbly
represent
to

this
do
not

They
insist

when

protest
it
be
quite
out

to
oblige

they
take
complete
possession
of
the
low

make
such

disturbance
that
the
occupant

could
not

<EOS>
the
noise
be
bad
enough

Charles

the
other
be
not
without
apprehension
that
the
officer
in
command
of
the
troop
may
compel
them
to
appear
before
him

<EOS>
this
danger
,
however
,
they
escape

owe
to
the
management
of
Rice

wish
to
know
whither
they
be
go
,
but
this
the
host
could
not

<EOS>
as
it
be
quite
certain
that
when
the
trooper
arrive
at
Lyme
Regis
,
they
must
learn
that
Macy
have
be
in
pursuit
of
the
fugitive

it
would
have
be
in
the
high
degree
imprudent
for
his

those
with
him
to
remain

<EOS>
Colonel

be
clearly
of
opinion
that
it
would
be
extremely
hazardous
for
his

attempt
to
embark
from
any

Dorsetshire
,
so
many
force

beseech
him

devise
for

I
feel

that

if

no
man
in

be
more
devoted

he
will

be
well
able

advise
how
to

will
furnish
any
money
that
may

require

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

I

when
I

my

<EOS>
the

however

It

that

Mr.

Though
Mrs.

can
not
be
describe
as
young
,
she
be
still
very
handsome

and
be
rich

it

the

the

hitherto

Mrs.

by
see

she
order
the
carver
to
take
him
some
more
slice
from
the

with
plenty
of
sauce
.
<EOS>
subsequently
,
she
send
him
a
couple

though
the
other

and
she
quite
surprise
the
butler
by
drink
to
her
humble
guest
in
a
glass
of
malvoisie
,
and
send
him
a
silver

Charles
entirely
approve
of

hope
he
should
not

her
long
,
as

not

<EOS>
the
parting
at
STONEHENGE
 
<EOS>
there
stand
those
grey
mysterious
circle
of
stone

that
for
century
have
brave
the
storm
that

wide
dreary
plain

there
they

stern

solemn

crust
with

enigmatical
as

people
whose

so
strange

mysterious
be
the

that
no

have
be
tell
of

<EOS>
some
have
think
the
pile
be
rear
by
magic
art

other
have
deem
it
the
work
of
the
Evil
One

intend
by
him
as
a
temple
where
unhallowed
rite
may

by

the
mighty
pile
be
rear
,
in
whatever
age
and
for
whatever
purpose
--
hallowed
,
or
unhallowed--
whether
as
an
altar
for
human
sacrifice
,
as
a
court
of
justice
,
or
as
a
place
of
execution
,
all
be
now
dim
conjecture

<EOS>
there
the
huge
stone
stand
as
of
yore

their
history
be
clean
forgotten

<EOS>
though
a
couple
of

a
great
change

take
place

<EOS>
a

<EOS>
the
genius
of
solitude
that
brood
over
the
pile
have
flee

flee
with
the
shy
bustard
that
once
haunt
its
mystic
circle
,
and
with
the
raven
that
perch
on
the
stone
.
<EOS>
the
wide
rolling
surface
of
the
plain
be

wholly
uncultivated

nothing
