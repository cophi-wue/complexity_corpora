a

Great

<EOS>
this

<EOS>
moreover
,
he
have
another

<EOS>
full

<EOS>
whetherit
be
his

Sir

Hartleton

but
then
when
he
come
to
consider
how
bald

a
narrative
he
have
to
tell
,
and
how
he
must
terminate
it
bysaye
that
he
have
no

he
suspect

he
know
not
what
,
he
give
up
,
the
idea
aspremature
,
and
turn
to
his

<EOS>
,
he
said,—“Albert

He
always
tell
me
he
be

that

<EOS>
then
he
would
sigh

hope
that
the

would
come

could
confide
all
to

I

in

which
bring
the

<EOS>
It
be
yet
very
early
,
but
Learmont
think
that
heshould
be
able
to
withdraw
his
mind
from
disagreeable
and
horriblereflection
by
healthful
walk
in
the
shady
Mall
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
take
his
hat
and
sword
,
and
walk
from
his
house
by
agarden

gate
,
open
into
a
narrow
lane
of
tree
,
which
terminate
inthe
park

verdure
;
but
it
wasexercise
that
Learmont
want
,
and
he
rather
rejoice
than
otherwise
atthe
necessity
of
active
walking
,
inasmuch
as
he
hope
exertion
of

control
the
excitement
of
his
mind

<EOS>
by
some
sort
of
instinct

Learmont
seem
to
feel

the
feeling

have
itnot

wouldhave

huge
trunkswould
have
effectually
hide
him
from
observation

<EOS>
as
it
be
,
however
,
he
pursue
his
walk
until
he
and
the
stranger
with

cloak
camenearly

<EOS>
then
,
as
the
stranger
lift
up
his
eye
,
whichhad
be
fix
on
the
ground
in
a
meditative
manner
,
Learmont
know
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
young
man
,
by
name
Frank
Hartleton
,
who
have
be
so
curiousand
suspicious
at
the
period
of
the
great
storm
at
Learmont
,
when
thewe
of
the
building
,
in
which
be
the
smithy
,
have
be
burn
down
.
<EOS>
the
recognition
be
evidently
mutual
;
indeed
,
no
one
who
have
once
seenLearmont
could
easily
again
forget
him
;
and
,
although
a
great
personalchange
have
take
place
in
the
appearance
of
Hartleton
,
yet
the
featuresof
all
who
have
take
any
part
in
the
proceeding
of
that
eventful
nightat
<EOS>
the
little
village
of
Learmont
be
too
indelibly
impressed
upon
thememory
of
the
squire
for
him
to
find
any
difficulty
in
recognise
inthe
staid
,
and
somewhat
grave
,
gentleman
person
before
him
,
the
FrankHartleton
who
have
always
hold
him
at
open
defiance
and
laugh
at
hispower
.
<EOS>
Hartleton
stop
short
when
he
see
Learmont
;
and
his
first
exclamationwas,—“this
be
strange
,
indeed!”“Sir
,
"
say
Learmont
,
"
do
you
address
me?”“scarcely
,
"
reply
Hartleton
;
"
but
your
name
be
Learmont?”“Well
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
reply
the
other
with
considerable
hauteur
.
<EOS>
“Do
<EOS>
you
know
me
,
Squire
Learmont?”“I
recognise
the
feature
,
and
know
the
name
of
many

saidLearmont
,
"
that
still
be
not
upon
my
roll
of

<EOS>
”“You
do
know
me
,
"
say
Hartleton
,
"
I
have
no
desire
to
be
rude
to
you
,
Squire
Learmont
;
but
our
sudden
meeting
take
me
somewhat
by
surprise
,
and
the
exclamation
that
I
utter
arise
from
the
curious
coincidencethat
<EOS>
I
have
be
all
night
dream
of
you
and
the
village
of
Learmont
,
and
be
in
deep
thought
about
the
mysterious
occurrence
that
tookplace
three
year
ago
when
I
suddenly
come
upon
you
.
”If
<EOS>
his
hatred
and
dread
of
Hartleton
would
have
induce
Learmont
<EOS>
totreat
him
in
such
a
manner
that
he
could
not
address
him
,
his
guiltyfear
urge
him
to
prolong
the
conversation
,
in
order
to
discover
,
ifpossible
,
the
complexion
of
Hartleton
’s
thought
with
regard
to
him
,
that
he
may
know
if
he
have
anything
really
to
dread
from
thatquarter
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
therefore
,
with
more
courtesy
that
he
said,—“The
coincidence
be
curious

<EOS>
I
<EOS>
—
I
believe
I
speak
to
Sir
FrancisHartleton
now?”“yes

reply
Hartleton
;

his
eye
upon

a
manner
that
it
require
all

not

“might

rushedwith
such
wild

shriek
from

”learmont
<EOS>
strove
to
command
his

to
indifference

but
,
theeffort
be
almost
beyond
his
power

and
he
speak
to
endeavour
to
coverhis
agitation
.
<EOS>
“It
be
very
strange

"
he
say
;
"
most
singular!”“And
the
little
child

too
,
that

continuedHartleton

what
can
have

Jacob

desiredhim

it
would
have

who

XVII.“The

at

Westminster.—Britton
’s
notion
of
greatness.—“whenthe
wine

Wit

”Jacob
<EOS>
Gray
be
quite
right
when
he
aver
that
the
smith
be
on
histrack
like
a
blood
-
hound
.
<EOS>
Britton
have
enter
heartily
into
the
schemeof
destroy
Gray
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
he
particularly
wish
toappropriate
to
himself
Gray
<EOS>
’s
portion
of
what
be
wrung
from
the
fearsof
Learmont
,
nor
do
he
particularly
see
or
care
for
the
destruction
ofGray
as
a
matter
of
policy
;
but
he
hate
him
personally
.
<EOS>
His
assumptionof
superior
address
be
especially
annoying
to
Britton
.
<EOS>
He
feel
thatgray
be
more
than
a
match
for
him
in
cunning
,
and
moreover
,
hedespise
him
for
the
cowardice
of
his
character
,
and
over
his
cupsthought
it
would
be
a
rare
thing
to
outwit
Jacob
Gray
,
which
,
translate
,
mean
kill
him
with
safety
—
not
personal
safety
in
the
actof
killing
,
but
safety
from
the
consequence
of
Gray
’s
extremeprecautionary
measure
for
his
own
preservation
.
<EOS>
the
smith
familiarise
himself
thus
with
the
thought
of
overcome
thewily
Jacob
,
and
his
ferocious
fancy
indulge
itself
in
glut
oversome
violent
and
bloody
death
for
the
man
who
have
presume
to
assumegreater
address
than
he
.
<EOS>
by
some
curious
train
of
thought
,
too
,
thesmith
always
consider
himself
as
personally
injure
by
Gray
,
becausethe
latter
,
when
he
visit
him
at
the
smithy
,
have
so
fence
himselfround
with
precaution
,
that
he
,
Britton
could
not
but
see
the
extremeimpolicy
of
knock
him
on
the
head
with
his
forge
hammer
,
which
hehad
fully
resolve
to
do
whenever
he
have
an
opportunity
.
<EOS>
“curse
him
!
"
<EOS>
Britton
would
growl
over
his
cup
,
"
I
will
have
his
lifeyet
.
<EOS>
despite
his
cunning
I
will
have
his
life!”britten
’s
scheme
of
operation
be
more
in
accordance
with
his
violentnature
than
any
which
Learmont
could
suggest
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
dog
Grayto
his
house
,
and
then
find
some
mean
of
admittance
,
either
wringfrom
his
fear
<EOS>
the
secret
of
where
he
keep
the
write
confession
hetalke
so
much
of
,
and
then
kill
him
;
or
should
that
plan
not
succeed
,
take
his
life
first
,
and
trust
to
his
power
of
search
to
find
thedangerous
document
somewhere
in
his
abode
.
<EOS>
with
this
project
in
view
,
Britton
have
keep
an
eye
on
the
house
ofLearmont
,
and
follow
Gray
upon
the
river
,
as
we
have
see
.
<EOS>
Great
be
the
rage
of
the
smith
at
the
utter
failure
of
this
,
his
firstattempt
to
ferret
out
the
hiding
-
place
of
Master
Gray
,
which
he
beganto
think
be
by
no
means
<EOS>
so
easy
a
job
as
he
have
suppose
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
should
gray
pursue
the
plan
he
have
commence
so
successfully
,
ofturne
upon
his
pursuer
,
the
scheme
would
be
fraught
with
the
greatestdifficultie
.
<EOS>
moreover
the
smith
could
not
conceal
from
himself
that
byhis
unsuccessful
attempt
he
have
put
Gray
upon
his
guard
,
which
be
thevery
last
thing
he
should
have
risk
.
<EOS>
all
these
reflection
put
thesmith
in
no
very
pleasant
mood
,
when
he
repair
from
the
water
-
side
to“The
Chequers
"
and
it
be
not
until
he
have
quaff
at
two
draught
ahuge
tankard
of
hum
ale
that
he
feel
his
equanimity
at
all
restore
.
<EOS>
He
then
begin
to
swear
awfully
,
which
unburden
his
mind
very
much
,
and
call
for
another
tankard
,
he
shouted—“Landlord
,
come
hither
,
man
.
<EOS>
dip
your
red
nose
in
the
tankard
.
<EOS>
”The
landlord
,
nothing
loth
,
take
a
hearty
draught
of
the
ale
,
afterwhich
<EOS>
he
smack
his
lip
with
a
know
air
,
and
look
intently
at
afly
-
cage
that
hang
from
the
ceiling
he
say
in
an
abstract
<EOS>
tone,—“this

<EOS>
I
must
keep
it
for

”“what

bestow
a
hard

with
it
on

that
he
have

he
could
not

the
objecthinte

husky
whisper
,
said,—“what

She

very
great

and
yet
where
else

find
a
place

<EOS>
the
sense
ofher
own
extreme
destitution

vividly
across
her
imagination

andhad

not

for
the
curious
gaze
of
the
early
passenger
she
meet

could
have

freely
in

bitterness
of

and

in

so
secluded
from

be

by
the
fear

mock

an
appearance

warmth

which
make
the
sharp
wind
thatwhistle
round
the
corner

seem
doubly
keen
and
pierce

<EOS>
“must
<EOS>
I
return

dismal

<EOS>
think
Ada—“must
I
again
throwmyself
on
the
mercy
of
that
man
who
call
himself
my

pause
in
doubt
and
irresolution
,
and
no
one
who
pass
could
failto
mark
the
air
of
deep
dejection
which
sit
upon
the
pale
anxious
faceof
the
young

<EOS>
It

chance
that

see
the
keen

sparkle
eye
of
an
old

<EOS>
His
beard
andgeneral
appearance
proclaim
him
a
Jew
,
and
scarcely
have
Ada
shrankfrom
his
gaze
,
and
pause
a
step
or
two
onwards
,
when
she
hear
a
voicebehind
her
saying,—“My

Learmont
labour
under
considerable
difficulty
in

therefore

<EOS>
the
task
of

one

Learmont
waste
many
month
in
try
to
dissuadehimself
from
persevere
in
his
present
course
,
and
take
a
large
sum
atonce

expatriate
himself
immediately
afterwards

which
,
by
-
the
-

Learmont
never
for

intend

for
hewould
have
slaughter

he
could

<EOS>
not
a

pass
without

at

he
alwayscarrie
away

much
as
he
could

but
how
truly
do
poor

say
that
the
love

<EOS>
”The

,
too
,
be
to
Learmont
ever
a
sight
of
terror

<EOS>
He
still
livedat
the
Chequers
,
close
to
Learmont
’s
mansion
;
and
he
,
too
,
paidperiodical
visit
to
the
proud
squire
,
although
his
demand
wereinsignificant
in
comparison
with
those
of
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
while
a
few
guinea
suffice
for
the
coarse
vice
,
the
drunkenness
,
andthe
debauchery
of
the
smith
,
Jacob
Gray
be
not
satisfied
unless
heincrease
his
hidden
store
by
a
large
sum

<EOS>
thus
,
although
the
smith
’s
eternal
"
message
from
the
Old
Smithy

gratedupon
his
very
soul
,
Learmont
do
not
feel
that
intensity
of
hatred
toBritton
that
he
do
to
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
he
make
frequent
offer
to
Britton
to
quit
the
country
,
and
give
up
to
him
certain
paper
which
,
on
the
night
of
the
murder
atthe
Old
Smithy
,
have
be
by
Britton
take
from
the
corpse
of
him
whomet
his
death
within
that
ill
-
name
pile
.
<EOS>
these
paper
be
of
as
much
importance
to
Learmont
as
any
could
wellbe
;
for
if
they
do
not
prove
his
illegitimacy
,
they
raise
the
pointso
strongly
that
have
he
stand
alone
as
the
last
and
only
heir
to
thevast
estate
of
Learmont
,
he
could
scarcely
have
establish
his
claim
.
<EOS>
of
this
he
be
assure
by
Gray
,
who
would
himself
have
glory
in
thepossession
of
such
a
document
,
but
he
dare
not
take
them
from
thebody
;
hence
they
fall
,
knowingly
by
him
,
into
the
hand
of
Britton
.
<EOS>
It
be
likewise
constantly
urge
by
Britton
that
he
,
too
,
have
aconfession
write
,
and
in
pursuance
of
his
word
,
have
roll
it
roundthe
knife
of
Jacob
Gray
,
which
the
latter
have
leave
behind
him
at
thesmithy
in
the
body
of
his
victim
.
<EOS>
for
a
long
time
it
have
become
an
object
with
Learmont
to
discover
fromBritton
where
he
keep
such
important
document
,
determine
,
should
hefind
out
,
to
make
some
desperate
effort
by
fraud
or
violence
to
possesshimself
of
them
;
but
the
smith
constantly
and
pertinaciously
elude
themost
artful
inquiry
,
and
Learmont
could
obtain
no
clue
to
where
theywere

,
although
by
Britton

’s
manner
<EOS>

to
do
violence
to

lest

may
have
adopt
some

to

seem

<EOS>
but
as
the
fevered
imagining
of
adream!From
some
hide
place
in
her
prison

house
,
she
would
sometimes
lookout
for
hour
together
upon
the
blue
sky
,
and
envy
the
wild
bird
asthey
wing
their
free
and
happy
flight
far

far

She
would
listen

too

to

aspire
lark
as
it
fly
up

up
towards

untilit
become

this
be

nothing
could
be
sweet
music
than
the
slowlydecreasing
cadence
of
that
wild
,
happy
song
of
the
lark
as
in
its
veryrecklessness

it
leave
the
earth
so
far

<EOS>
far
away
sometimes
in
the
open
field
she
would
see
some
one
pickinghis
or
her
way
along
the
swampy
ground
,
and
she
bless
the
sight
offany
other
human
face

Gray’s

<EOS>
then
in
the
old
house
there
be
insect
—
crawl
thing
,
which
in
thegreat
world
be
despise
and
put
to
death
because
we
can
not
see
theirbeautie
,
nor
appreciate
their
pain
;
but
Ada
,
with
a
simple
andbeautiful
theology
,
teach
her
by
her
own
heart
,
and
cull
from
thefew
book
she
have
read
,
fear
not
these
creature
,
for
she
look
uponthem
all
with

<EOS>
so
in
course
of
time
the
very
mouse
would
come
forth
at
the
sound
of
hervoice
and
eat
from
her
hand
,
peer
at
her
from
their
bright
twinklingeye
,
without
fear
.
<EOS>
Ada
shrink
from
no
live
thing
but
Jacob
Gray
,
and
him
<EOS>
she
avoid
asmuch
as
possible
.
<EOS>
He
always
bring
home
with
him
food
enough
for
theirwant
,
and
Ada
take
her
portion
in
silence
.
<EOS>
there
be
one
small
roomwhich
she
have
appropriate
to
her
own
use
,
and
into
that
room
sheforbade
Jacob
Gray
to
enter
.
<EOS>
wicked
and
ruthless
as
he
be
,
that
younggirl
have
acquire
a
kind
of
moral
control
over
him
which
he
could
notshake
off
.
<EOS>
They
never
converse
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
discussion
.
<EOS>
Their
wholeintercourse
resolve
itself
to
this:—that
he
would
murder
her
if
shedid
not
promise
to
abide
where
she
be
without
make
an
effort
toescape
,
and
she
,
have
promise
so
much
,
be
otherwise
a
free
agent
,
and
under
no
sort
of
control
from
him
.
<EOS>
thus
the
season
have
roll
on
,
and
Ada
have
mark
the
subsidence
ofwinter
and
the
bud
beauty“of
<EOS>
the
sweet
spring
-
time,”from
her
lonely
home
.
<EOS>
sometimes
Jacob
Gray
would
be
absent
for
a
whole
day
,
and
Ada
be
gladhe
stay
away
,
for
she
would
then
sing
to
herself
old
ballad
whichwere
dear
to
her
,
because
the
book
from
which
she
have
learn
them
hadbeen
lend
to
her
by
Albert
Seyton
.
<EOS>
but
when
she
hear
his
well
-
knownsignal
of
return
,
she
go
to
her
own
room
,
and
sing
no
more
.
<EOS>
thus
,
toa
certain
extent
,
Ada
enjoy
the
glorious
summer
,
although
she
couldnot
wander
in
the
green
field
,
or
lose
herself
among
shady
tree
.
<EOS>
thesoft
genial
air
,
however
,
visit
the
ill

omened
house
at
Battersea
,
asfreely
as
it
blow
its
sweet
in
at
the
window
of
a
palace
,
and
thesewere
moment
when
Ada
feel
most
happy
.
<EOS>
Gray
,
when
he
remain
out
the
whole
day
,
never
mention
to
Ada
hisintention
of
so
do
;
but
she
know
that
if
the
day
fully
dawn
and
hecame
not
,
that
he
would
wait
until
the
shade
of
evening
render
itsafe
for
him
to
cross
the
field
without
the
risk
of
observation
.
<EOS>
on
these
occasion
it
seem
to
Ada
as
if
she
be
half
liberated
fromher
prison

brace
the
nerve
of
the
young
girl
.
<EOS>
She
take
Maud
by
the
arm
,
and
look
her
earnestly
in
the
face
,
<EOS>
shesaid,—“What

press
her

upon

<EOS>
Ada
hear
the
outer
door
now
close
,
and
she
be
sure
that
Gray
be
inthe
passage
.
<EOS>
He
may
,
or
he
may
not
,
enter
the
room
in
which
she
andmaud
be
,
the
door
of
which
be
within
a
few
pace
of
the
step

<EOS>
oh
,
how
dreadful
to
poor
Ada
be
the
few
short
,
but
to
her
awful
momentsthat
elapse
before
she
feel
convinced
that
Gray
have
pass
the
door
,
he
always
tread
slowly
and
stealthily
even
in
that
lone
house
,
forcaution
and
suspicion
have
grow
so
habitual
with
him

that
even
insecurity
he
could
not
shake
off
the
action

render

It
be
difficult

therefore
,
for

to
trace
his
footstep
,

come
toany
positive
conclusion
as
to
what
part
of
the
house

have
proceededtoward

<EOS>
one
thing
only
she
could
feel
certain
of

during
which
Maud
didnot

rock
to

sigh
deeply

many
be
the

<EOS>
although

shake

It

by
the
order
of
Britton
,
who
foundhimself
more
at

enjoy

better

strangelyin

at

he
suffer
a
panggreater

the
conviction
cameacros
his

that
Britton
be
force
his
way
into

despite
of
every
obstacle

<EOS>
this
be
an
event
which

aware
thatthe
strange

come
with

have
burst

rush
from

Albert

too

have
be
often

linger
about
the

until

the

,
with
whose
weal
or

the
happiness

sorrow
of
his
dear
sonwas
so
much
mixed

then
he
beseech
Albert
to
be
patient
,
and
trust
in
Heaven
to
sendsuccour
to
her
whom
he
love
;
and
when
Albert
himself
could
walk
sofar
,
he
go
with
his
father
to
the
old
house
,
and
wander
for
hoursfrom
room
to
room
,
please
himself
with
the
thought
that
he
wastreade
upon
the
spot
oft
trodden

daily

return
,

the
search
throughout
London
and
its
suburb
for

<EOS>
when
weary
with
some
long
perambulation
,
he
would
bend
his
stepsto

sit
in
melancholy
thought
upon

hear
the

there
,
chew

he
would
recline
for
hour

devise
fresh
scheme
for
the
discovery
of
Ada

andtrye
to
recollect
some
part
of
the

He
would
then
wander
homeward

listless

dispirited

torelate
to
his
father
the
particular

non

<EOS>
It
be
upon
one
of
these
occasion
that
poor
Albert
be
more

dispirited

that
his

say
kindly

him,—“Albert

what
I
advise
be
an
immediate
communication

the

Sir

Thefact
that
a

packet
be
actually
address
to
him

setsuch
a

will
be
sufficient
to

<EOS>
”Albert
remain
in
thought
for
a
few
moment
,
and
then
spring
fromhis

with
energy
,
he
exclaimed,—“Yes
,
father
,
let
us
do
so
.
<EOS>
there
be
hope
in
that
.
<EOS>
Sir
FrederickHartleton
must
have
mean
of
inquiry
,
and
source
of
information
thatno
one

a

in
his
situation
could
have

<EOS>
let
us
go
at

”“You
be
weary
now

Albert

”“No

no

I
be
never
weary
in

”“Wait

come
with

now

<EOS>
You
have
make
this
suggestion

and
it
maybe
a
most
happy
one

<EOS>
come
now!”“i
will
not
baulk
you

"
say
Mr.
Seyton
,
rise

I
do
not
think
it
aprop
course
;
but
do
not
build
too
much
upon
it

only
lookupon
it

grieve
him

who
supply

love
Squire

be
sure

that’sthe
question

for
one
of
two

I
will
swear

either
as
a

He
walk
very
quickly
down

the
object
of

searchwas
nowhere
to
be

and
he
feel
convinced
that

must
have
gonein
the
opposite
direction

although
he
feel
almost
sure
likewise
thathe
have
notice
a
figure

step
into
the
shadow

a
doorway

escape
recognition
from

drunken

infuriate
man

He
then
resolve
to
follow
him
,
to
see

he
go

easily
discover

therefore
,
the
unequal
footstep
of
Britton

the
disguisedmagistrate
follow
him
closely

safely

the
smith
pause
at
the
corner
of
the
street
,
and
ask
a
drowsywatchman
if
he
have
see
a
beggar
woman
pass
.
<EOS>
He
be
at
once
answer
inthe
affirmative
,
and
in
the
same
breath
ask
for
something
to
drink
,
which
Britton

be
at
the

time
more
savage
than
hospitable

refuse
with
the
addition
of
a
curse

<EOS>
Sir

now
congratulate
himself
upon

the
smith

forhe
doubt
not

should
he
encounter
poor

,
he
would
inflictupon
her
some
fatal
injury

blunder
on

cursing

he
could

Britton
walk
on
in

with
a

of
triumph

rush
onwards

Sir

keptas
close
as
prudence

dictate

clear

Dark

Sir

plainly
see
the
upper
part

the
bulky
form

slight
relief
against

walk
slowly
alongclose

twice

his
pursuer

on

a

plaintive
voicebroke
the
stillness

night

,
with
a
mockery
of
gaiety
,
that
have
in
it
the
very
soul
of
pathos
,
sing

rather
chaunte
theword
of
a
song
of
joy

hope

and
mirth
,
which
be
then
popular
in

and
be
the
composition
of
one
of

most
distinguishedwit
of

<EOS>
there
be
a
wild
abandonment
of

about
the
singer

the
attention
of
Sir

but
now
thathe

suddenly
pause

he
pause
likewise
,
and
the
strainswith
all
their
melancholy
pathos
come
full
upon

ear

a
solemn
stillness
reign
for
a
few
brief
second
,
and
then
Sir
Frederick
see
the
shadowy
form
of
the
smith
glideforward
—
the
gruff
voice
of
the
savage
drunkard
come
to
his
ear
as
hestoope
and
exclaimed,—“So

—
we
have

boundedacross

<EOS>
He
pause
,
however
,
when
he
be
within
a
few
pace
ofBritton
,
for
he
hear
the
poor
mad
creature
speak
,

the
thoughtcrosse
his
mind
that
her
cry
have
proceed
from
sudden
surprise
,
andnot
from
any
injury
inflict
by
the

his

to

her
any
violence

he
may
as
wellhear
it

as
in

probability
it
would
be
important
and
correct
.
<EOS>
act
on
this
supposition
,
he
crouch
down
close
by
the
wall
for
somefew
second
—
then
suddenly
recollect
the
parapet
on
the
other
side
,
and
the
facility
it
afford
as
sufficiently
close
to
aid
poor
Maudin
case
of
the
most
sudden
emergency
,
he
creep
softly
twenty
yard
ormore
away
,
and
then
clamber
over
the
wall
in
a
moment
,
on
to
theparapet
.
<EOS>
to
draw
himself
along
this
noiselessly
until
he
actually
facedBritton
,
be
the
work
but
of
another
minute
,
and
lay
flat
down
wasquite
secure
from

<EOS>
Ada
feel
that
after
the
experience
of
the
recent
interview
with
Gray
,
she
have
a
power
over
him
which
,
be
she
free
from
her
promise
not
toescape
,
she
may
use
for
the
purpose
of
restore
herself
to
liberty
.
<EOS>
that
power
be
ground
on
the
superstition
of
his
character
—
a
weaknesswhich
have
grow
with
his
crime
,
and
be
increase
by
the
constantpang
of
remorse
,
which
even
he
could
not
stifle
entirely
.
<EOS>
the
solitudelikewise
,
and
the
constant
state
of
tremble
anxiety
in
which
helive
,
have
shatter
his
nervous
system
to
that
degree
that
he
wasindee
a
melancholy
and
warning
spectacle
of
the
mental
and
bodilywreck
to
which
crime
be
sure
to
reduce
its
unhallowed
perpetrator
.
<EOS>
His
eye
be
sink
and
blood
-
shot
,
his
lip
never
bear
the
hue
ofhealth
,
his
step
be
stealthy
and
trembling
,
and
his
hand
shake
likean
aspen
leaf
.
<EOS>
He
would
lock
himself
in
the
room
which
contain
hishoarde
wealth
,
and
recount
the
glitter
mass
for
hour
together
;
butstill
he
could
not
think
it
enough
.
<EOS>
the
demon
of
avarice
have
get
aclutch
of
his
heart
,
and
the
large
the
amount
of
his
gold
become
,
thewider
range
<EOS>
his
love
of
the
bright
temptation
take
,
and
constantlyfixe
a
sum
far
beyond
what
he
have
as
that
which
would
content
him
andenable
him
to
put
in
practice
his
scheme
of
departure
from
England
,
andvengeance
upon
Learmont
and
Britton
.
<EOS>
“I
must
yet
have
more
,
"
he
would
mutter
.
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
but
a
short
delay
,
andLearmont
can
not
refuse
me
the
gold
.
<EOS>
yes
,
two
hundred
more
of
thosepiece
shall
satisfy
me
.
<EOS>
that
will
make
up
a
goodly
sum
;
and
then
,
insome
other
land
,
I
shall
get
some
sleep
undisturbed
by
the
awfulvision
that
here
crowd
upon
my
tremble
imagination;—but
two
hundredmore
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
may
get
so
much
before
this
month
be
past
,
and
then
Ishall
be
save
the
trouble
of
extort
a
renewal
of
the
promise
ofthis
wilful
girl
.
<EOS>
yes
,
it
shall
be
so
.
<EOS>
I
will
raise
my
demand
uponlearmont
.
<EOS>
He
cannot
—
dare
not
say
me
nay
,
unless
I
be
to
becomeoutrageously
unreasonable
in
my
draft
upon
his
purse.—two
hundred.—letme
<EOS>
think;—five
visit
at
twenty
pound
each
will
be
half
the
money
.
<EOS>
Pshaw
!
<EOS>
I
will
have
forty
each
visit
.
<EOS>
ay
,
forty
;
that
will
not
alarmhim
:
if
I
insist
on
more
he
may
,
in
his
cautious
brain
,
think
uponthe
scheme
I
mean
to
practise
,
and
take
some
mean
of
most
effectuallyprevente
such
ruin
to
himself
.
<EOS>
I
will
lull
his
suspicion
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
what
aday
of
triumph
will
it
be
to
me
when
I
sail
from
England
with
theconviction
that
,
within
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
after
I
be
go
,
Learmontand
Britton
will
each
inhabit
a
prison
.
<EOS>
They
will
then
confess
thatJacob
Gray
be
cunning
.
<EOS>
the
sneer
will
turn
with
an
awful
fact
to
them
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
one
drawback.—i
shall
not
see
them
hung
.
<EOS>
No;—I
cannot
—
darenot
—
stay
to
see
them
hung
.
<EOS>
Ada
will
be
rich
and
great
;
but
she
willknow
who
I
be
.
<EOS>
Will
she
use
her
wealth
in
hunt
me
through
the
world?Or
<EOS>
will
she
forgive
in
the
flush
of
her
prosperity
?
<EOS>
if
—
if
—
I
thoughtthat
the
firm
,
untameable
spirit
which
this
girl
evidently
possess
,
and
which
I
may
confess
it
here
in
secret
,
daunt
<EOS>
me,—if
<EOS>
I
think
itwould
induce
her
to
hunt
me
down
,
as
she
may
,
for
her
mean
would
beample
for
such
an
object
,
be
I
hide
even
in
the
bowel
of
theearth
,
<EOS>
I’d
—
I’d
—
<EOS>
kill
her
ere
<EOS>
I
go
.
<EOS>
yes
,
some
night
when
she
sleep
Icould
do
it
;
but
not
till
the
hour
before
I
mean
to
go
<EOS>
;
for
I
—
I
couldnot
stay
in
this
lone
place
without
her
.
<EOS>
She
scorn
me,—treat
me
witha
haughty
contempt
;
will
scarcely
condescend
to
address
me
:
but
stillshe
be
here
,
and
there
be
company
in
the
thought
that
I
know
I
be
notquite
alone
in
this
gloomy
place
.
<EOS>
She
may
load
me
with
opprobrium,—shemay
heap
scorn
upon
my
head
;
but
she
be
here
,
and
I
could
not
lie
downfor
one
night
here
,
without
the
conviction
that
there
be
some
one
elsewithin
these
wall

<EOS>
so
,
Ada
,
you
be
safe
now

very
safe
;
but
ere
I
go
Imust
<EOS>

some
subtle
mean

what
will
be
your

when

there

to
look
about

such
be
his

,
from

he

have
personally
to

so
near

brief
look

Jacob

first
care
,
when
he
leave

to
the
room
inwhich
he
conceal

collect
together
the
reallylarge
sum

have
from
time
to
time
wrung
from
the
guilty
fear
<EOS>
ofLearmont
,
he
bestow
it
about
his
person
,
and
then
carefully
placinghis
write

,
with
its
dangerous
address
,
in
his
breast
,
hehurrie
to
the
street

,
upon
the
back
of
which
he
write
with
apiece
of
chalk
,
"

and
A.

"
thus
endeavour
toparalyse
<EOS>
the
magistrate
’s
exertion
in
the
way
of
search
by
inducinghim
to
think
that
the
house
have
be
desert
by
Jacob
Gray
for
sometime
.
<EOS>
He
then
with
wild
haste
run
through
the
house
conceal
everything
inthe
shape
of
provision
which
would
undeniably
indicate
a
recentoccupancy
of
it
.
<EOS>
Ada

bed
and
his
own
he
cast
into
a
dusty
cupboard
,
and
altogether
succeed
in
produce
a
general
appearance
of
litterand
desertion
.
<EOS>
then
,
without
dare
to
cast
another
look
from
the
window
,
for
fear
heshould
be
see
,
he
rush
to
the
room
in
which
he
have
leave
Ada
,
andgette
through
the
opening
in
the
wall
,
he
close
the
panel
and
stoodtrembling
so
exceedingly
on
the
ladder
,
<EOS>
that
have
he
wish
he
couldscarcely
have
command
physical
energy
sufficient
to
descend
.
<EOS>
Hisobject
,
however
,
be
to
remain
there
,
and
listen
to
what
be
pass
,
which
he
could
not
do
below
.
<EOS>
“Ada
,
Ada
,
"
he
say
,
in
a
low
tone
,
"
you
—

be
safe?”“I
be
here
,
"
say
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Hush
!
<EOS>
Hush
!
<EOS>
not
another
word
,
not
even
a
whisper
;
hush
,
for
your
life
,
hush!”a
heavy
knock
at
the
outer
door
now
echo
fearfully
through
thespacious
passage
and
empty
room
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
to
Gray
that
knockcould
not
have
be
more
agonising
<EOS>
have
it
be
against
his
own
heart
.
<EOS>
by
an
impulse
that
he
could
not
restrain
,
he
keep
on
say
in
ahalf
-
choke
whisper
,
"
hush
—
hush
—
hush
!
"
<EOS>
while
he
clutch
the
side
ofthe
ladder
till
his
nail
dig
painfully
into
the
palm
of
his
hand
,
and
a
cold
perspiration
hang
in
massive
drop
upon
his
brow
.
<EOS>
Adameanwhile
be

a
little
use
to
the
darkness
of
the
place
,
andfeele
cautiously
about
<EOS>
,
she
find
one
of
the
basket
she
recollectedto
have
see
there
before
.
<EOS>
this
she
sit
down
upon
,
and
bury
her
facein
<EOS>
her
hand
<EOS>
,
she
give
herself
up
to
gloomy
reflection
,
while
tear
,
which
she
would
not
let
Jacob
Gray
see
for
world
slowly
andnoiselessly
trickle
through
her
small
finger
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
moment
the
knock
at
the
door
again
sound
through
the
house
,
and
Gray
,
although
he
be
expect
it
,
nearly
fall
from
the
ladder
inthe
nervous
start
that
he
give
.
<EOS>
then
follow
a
long
silence
,
after
which
a
voice
come
to
his
ear
inindistinct
tone
,
say
something
which
terminate
with
the
words,—“inthe
King
’s
name
.
<EOS>
”There
be
then
a
slight
pause
,
follow
in
a
moment
by
a
crash
;
andJacob
Gray
know
that
the
door
be
burst
open
.
<EOS>
a
sensation
of
awful
thirst
now
come
over
Gray
—
such
thirst
as
he
hadread
of
only
as
be
endure
by
adventurous
traveller
in
crossinghundred
of
mile
of
sandy
desert
.
<EOS>
His
tongue
seem
to
cleave
to
theroof
of
his
mouth
,
and
his
parch
lip
be
like
fire
to
his
touch
.
<EOS>
still
he
clutch
by
the
ladder
,
and
each
slight
noise
that
meet
hisoverstraine
attention
add
fearfully
to
the
pang
of
apprehensionthat
torture
him
thus
physically
and
mentally
.
<EOS>
He
could
hear
the
sound
of
heavy
footstep
through
the
house
,
andoccasionally
the
low
murmur
of
voice
come
upon
his
ear
,
although
hecould
not
detect
what
be
say
.
<EOS>
that
they
would
,
however
,
come
to
theroom
from
which
he
be
only
separate
by
a
thin
piece
of
wainscottinghe
know
;
and
if
his
dread
and
agitation
be
great
now
,
he
think
witha
shudder
what
would
be
his
feeling
when
each
moment
may
produce
hisdiscovery
and
capture
.
<EOS>
then
he
strain
his
ear
to
listen
if
he
could
hear
Ada
moan
,
and
alow
stifle
sigh
ascend
from
the
gloomy
vault
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
yes

"
he
think
.
<EOS>
"
She
will
be
still
—
she
will
be

<EOS>
the
fearof

and
violent

upon
her
young

besides

if

find

,
what
evidence—”jacob
<EOS>
Gray
very
nearly
utter
a
cry
of
terror
as
this
thought
<EOS>
passedthrough
his
mind
<EOS>
,
for
he
immediately
then
recollect
his
own
writtenconfession
that
he
have
in
the
breast
pocket
of
his
coat
,
and
which
,
ifhe
be
take
,
would
be
his
destruction
.
<EOS>
He
strike
his
forehead
with
his
clenched
hand
,
and
utter
a
deepgroan
.
<EOS>
what
mean
have
he
there
,
situate
as
he
be
,
of
destroy
thedamne
evidence
of
a
guilt
which
otherwise
would
only
rest
onconjecture
and
surmise
,
and
from
the
consequence
of
which

it
notbee
distinctly
prove
,
the
money
and
influence
of
Learmont
,
exertedfor
his
own
sake
,
may
actually
free
him
.
<EOS>
the
write
confession
wasan
admirable
weapon
against
Learmont
,
so
long
as
he
,
Jacob
Gray
,
hadthe
control
of
it
,
and
live
;
but
now
,
when
there
be
a
fearful
chanceof
his
own
apprehension
,
it
be
at
once
convert
into
a
fearful
weaponagainst
himself
,
and
a
damn
evidence
of
his
guilt
.
<EOS>
for
some
moment
he
be
incapable
of
anything
resemble
rationalthought
,
and
his
reason
seem
totter
to
its
base
.
<EOS>
this
state
ofmind
,
however
,
pass
away
,
and
how
to
destroy
his
confession
becamethe
one
great
question
that
agitate
and
occupy
his
throbbing
andintensely
labour
brain
.
<EOS>
if
he
attempt
to
tear
it
into
fragment
,
he
must
either
cast
thesefragment
on
the
door
of
the
vault
,
from
whence
they
would
easily
berecovere
,
or
he
must
keep
them
in
his
possession
,
which
would
availhim
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
think
of
descend
the
ladder
,
and
dig
a
hole
with
his
hand
,
in
which
to
bury
the
dangerous
document
,
but
then
Ada
be
there
,
andwould
by
the
dim
light
of
that
place
<EOS>
see
what
he
be
about
,
and
it
wasnot
to
be
suppose
that
she
would
keep
a
secret
<EOS>
she
be
so
strongly
andpersonally
interested
in
reveal
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
one
other
resource
that
occur
to
the
madden
brain
ofJacob
Gray
,
and
that
be
one
which
,
in
his
present
state
,
nothing
butthe
abject
,
awful
fear
of
death
by
the
hand
of
the
executioner
<EOS>
couldhave
bring
him
to
<EOS>
—
it
be
to
tear
the
confession
into
small
piece
,
and
eat
it
.
<EOS>
with
tremble
hand
,
while
he
stand
upon
the
ladder
as
well
as
hecould
,
he
draw
the
paper
from
his
breast
,
and
notwithstanding
his
awfuland
intense
thirst
,
he
begin
tear
off
piece
by
piece
from
it
,
andforce
himself
to
swallow
it
.
<EOS>
thus
have
this
write
confession
—
this
master
-
stroke
of
policy
,
<EOS>
uponwhich
he
have
so
much
prided
himself
,
become
to
him
a
source
of
tormentand
pain
.
<EOS>
occasionally
he
could
hear
a
door
shut
in
the
house
,
as
Sir
FrancisHartleton
and
his
two
officer
pursue
their
search
,
and
he
go
onwith
frantic
eagerness
devour
the
paper
.
<EOS>
now
,
by
the
distinctness
of
the
sound
,
he
feel
sure
those
who
soughthim
be
in
the
next
apartment
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
short
moment
they
would
bethere
,
his
danger
be
thicken
,
and
the
confession
be
not
halfdispose
of
.
<EOS>
with
tremble
finger
,
that
impede
themselves
,
he
toreoff
large
piece
,
and
force
them
into
his
mouth
,
to
the
danger
ofchoke
himself
.
<EOS>
now
he
really
hear
the
door
of
the
room
open
,
and
the
heavy
tread
ofman
upon
the
floor
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
moment
there
be
a
death
-
like
stillness
,
and
Jacob
Gray
stand
in
the
act
of
suspend
mastication
,
with
a
largepiece
of
the
confession
fix
in
his
tooth
.
<EOS>
then
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
’s
voice
,
or
what
he
guess
to
be
his
,
fromthe
tone
of
authority
in
which
he
speak
,
come
upon
Gray
’s
ear
.
<EOS>
“This
be
very
strange
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
to
my
thinking
,
there
be
evidentindication
of
recent
inhabitant
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
go
down
to
the
door
,
and
ask
your
comrade
if
he
have
hear
anything
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
,
Sir
Francis
,
"
reply
another
voice
,
and
the
door
close
,
indicative
of
the
man
proceed
on
his
errand
.
<EOS>
“Now
—
now
,
"
think
Gray
,
"
if
we
be
alone
—
if
there
be
no
other
,
apistol
would
rid
me
for
ever
of
his
troublesome
and
most
unwelcomevisit
.
<EOS>
”Sir
<EOS>
Francis
speak
,
as
if
commune
with
himself
,
in
a
low
voice
—
but
inthe
breathless
stillness
around
,
Gray
hear
distinctly
what

He
hear

lead
into

from
one

a
heavy
careless

whistle

then

when

CHAPTER
XLVI.The
<EOS>
Death
of
the
Elder
<EOS>
Seyton.—Albert
’s
<EOS>
grief.—the
prophecy
.
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
now
that
we
should
,
although
unwillingly
,
leave
thefortune
of
the
beautiful
and
persecute
Ada
to
proceed
by
themselvesfor
a
short
space
,
while
we
acquaint
the
reader
with
what
the
otherimportant
personage
in
our
story
have
be
and
be
about
.
<EOS>
first
,
we
will
turn
to
Albert
Seyton
,
who
,
with
his
father
,
returnedfrom
the
office
of
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
rather
dispirit
thanotherwise
at
the
result
of
the
interview
with
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
that
Albert
reason
with
himself
on
the
folly
of
hishaving
have
any
immediate
expectation
of
news
of
Ada
through
theinterposition
of
the
magistrate
.
<EOS>
He
do
feel
depressed
anddisappointe
,
and
the
word
indicative
of
the
difficulty
that
envelopedthe
business
which
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
have
use
make
a
far
greaterimpression
upon
the
mind
of
Albert
than
anything
else
that
hadtranspire
at
the
interview
.
<EOS>
have
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
not
be
a
magistrate
,
but
a
mere
privategentleman
,
know
what
he
do
,
and
suspect
what
he
do
,
in
allprobability
the
interview
with
the
Seytons
would
have
be
moresatisfactory
to
them
,
and
more
productive
of
beneficial
result
to
ada;but
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
Sir
Francis
feel
that
,
in
his
official
capacity
,
hecould
not
be
too
cautious
as
to
what
he
say
,
or
what
opinion
hesuggeste
,
in
any
criminal
undertaking
.
<EOS>
thus
he
do
not
(
and
so
far
hewas
quite
correct
)
feel
himself
justified
in
mention
the
name
ofLearmont
,
unless
the
Seytons
have
hear
it
previously
,
in
connexion
withany
of
the
mysterious
circumstance
surround
Ada
.
<EOS>
as
yet
all
be
mere
suspicion
;
and
there
be
no
direct
evidence
onwhich
to
find
an
open
accusation
against
the
act
of
Squire
Learmont;for
although
he
,
Sir
Francis
,
by
put
together
all
the
circumstancesin
his
own
mind
,
feel
morally
convinced
that
there
have
be
some
greatcrime
commit
,
in
which
Learmont
,
Britton
the
smith
,
the
man
Gray
,
and
possibly
other
be
implicate
,
still
the
evidence
of
that
crimewere
to
be
seek
;
and
it
would
have
be
highly
inconsistent
with
him
,
Sir
Francis
,
as
a
magistrate
,
to
have
bring
a
loose
andunsubstantiate
charge
against
any
one
—
much
less
<EOS>
a
man
with
whom
itcould
be
easily
prove
he
have
previously
quarrel
,
and
who
may
,
bythe
very
indiscretion
of
make
an
improper
charge
against
,
be
so
farput
upon
his
caution
,
as
to
succeed
in
effectually
destroy
allevidence
that
could
ever
militate
against
him
.
<EOS>
take
,
therefore
,
this
view
of
the
case
,
and
be
satisfied
that
theseyton
have
communicate
to
him
all
they
know
;
and
have
their
promiseto
bring
him
any
fresh
information
they
may
become
possessed
of
,
heresolve
to
prosecute
the
matter
quietly
and
cautiously
,
until
,
bygette
some
of
the
party
in
his
hand
,
he
would
be
able
to
puttogether
something
distinct
in
the
shape
of
a
charge
against
Learmont
,
or
ascertain
his
innocence
.
<EOS>
the
magistrate
have
see
much
of
human
nature
,
and
he
very
soon
come
tothe
conclusion
,
in
his
own
mind
,
that
brave
,
ardent
,
and
enthusiasticas
Albert
Seyton
be
,
he
would
be
very
far
from
an
efficient
assistantin
a
matter
that
require
the
utmost
coolness
,
caution
,
and
finesse
.
<EOS>
thus
it
be
that
he
act
entirely
independent
of
Albert
,
and
say
aslittle
to
him
as
he
could
upon
the
subject
,
at
the
same
time
that
he
,
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
would
not
have
lose
a
moment
in
communicatingwith
Albert
,
have
any
discovery
really
take
place
at
the
old
house
atbattersea
.
<EOS>
while
all
this
be
go
on
,
Albert
Seyton
pursue
his
inquiry
,
although
with
a
languid
spirit
,
for
there
be
no
place
he
have
notalready
several
time
visit
.
<EOS>
twice
or
thrice
he
have
actually
lookedat
the
house
in
which
Ada
be
a
prisoner
,
and
once
he
think
ofcrosse
the
field
from
curiosity
to
visit
it
,
but
be
tell
that
itwas
in
ruin
,
and
in
fact
dangerous
to
approach
,
as
it
be
expect
tofall
to
the
ground
very
shortly
;
and
consider
it
as
a
most
unlikelyplace
to
search
in
,
stand
as
it
do
so
very
much
expose
toobservation
in
its
situation
,
he
abandon
the
notion
of
cross
themarshy
field
to
the
old
ruin
.
<EOS>
pale
and
languid
,
he
would
return
to
his
father
in
the
evening
,
and
itwas
some
time
before
he
notice
that
there
be
perceptible
sign
<EOS>
ofrapid
decay
creep
over
the
only
earthly
tie
he
have
,
save
Ada

<EOS>
in

<EOS>
Mr.
Seyton

in

<EOS>
every
other
consideration
be
now
abandon

<EOS>
It

however

that

an
hour
at

fête
would
be
relate
throughout
that
circleof
nobility
and
power
into
which
it
be
the
grand
end
and
aim
of
hislife
to
force
himself
;
and
,
it
add
one
more
damn
argument
to
thosealready
rapidly
accumulate
in
his
mind
towards
the
conviction
,
thatafter
all
he
have
make
a
grand
mistake
in
life
,
and
mistake
the
road
tohappiness
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
however
,
he
feel
that
have
choose
thepath
of
guilt
he
have
,
there
be
for
him
no
retreat
,
and
with
a
doggedperseverance
,
compound
of
mortify
ambition

life
of

he
lie
such
aninanimate

helpless
mass
in

it
be
not
the
least
ofLearmont
’s
annoyance
that
he

of
the
drunken

hour
before

off
the
intoxication
under
theinfluence
of
which
he
have

in
the
manner
describe
in
theball

room
,
and
when
he
do
recover
,
and
open
his
heavy
eye
,
it
waswith
no
small
degree
of
surprise
that
he
find
himself
in
the
same
darkroom
into
which
the
squire
have
throw
him
to
sleep
off
his
debauch
.
<EOS>
His
first
thought
be
that
he
be
in
prison
,
and
he
rise
to
his
feetwith
bitter
imprecation
and
awful
curse
upon
the
head
of
Learmont
andGray
,
whom
he
suppose
must
have
betray
him
in
some
way

secondthought

this
delusion

be
not
exactly
thekind
of
person
to
waste
much
time
in
idle
conjecture
or
imaginativetheorie
as
to
where
he
be
;
but
,
ascertain
that
the
door
waslocke
,
he
place
his
shoulder
against
it
and
with
one
heave
of
hisbulky
form
,
force
it
from
its
hinge
.
<EOS>
a
loud
cry
arrest
the
smith
’s
attention
as
he
accomplish
this
feat
,
and
,
to
his
great
amusement
,
he
see
lie
amid
the
confusion
of
a
tray

a
piece

sport
quite
in

way

one
of
those
practicaljest
that
he
perfectly
understand

appreciate

in
order

however

to
add
zest
to
it
,
he

the
astonished

a
hearty

to
spring
to
his

make
off
with
frantic
speed

corner

apart

<EOS>
Gray
appear
to
be
in
deep
thought
during
this
time
,
and
then
takingAda
by
the
arm
,
he
say
in
a
tremble
voice,—“This

Ada
make
no
resistance
,
but
suffer
herself
to
be
conduct
into
oneof
the
little
alcove
which
now
exist

<EOS>
then
,
after
a
pause
,
Jacob
Grayspoke
to
her
in
a
low
,
earnest
tone
,
to
the
follow
purport:—“ada

the

when
you
will
be
free

free

in

with
the
mean
of
give

however
wayward

the

aspect

<EOS>
You
willbe
guide
implicitly

for
the
space
of
about
one
month

longer

then
all
that
I
promise
will
be
fulfil
,
and
you
will
behappy
.
<EOS>
You
may
then
forget
Jacob
Gray
,
for
you
will
see
him
no
more
.
<EOS>
inanother
country
I
will
spend
the
remainder
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
what
I
be
aboutto
do
now
be
,
to
seek
in
the
very
heart
of
this
populous
city
,
atemporary
abode
for
you
and
myself
.
<EOS>
I
be
tired
of
solitude

lonelyplace

<EOS>
Ada
,
you
must
for
that
brief
month
assume
in
all
appearance
thecharacter
of
my
daughter

<EOS>
”Ada
<EOS>
shudder
,
and
shrink
back
as
far
as
she
possibly
could
into
thealcove
,
for
Gray
,
in
the
earnestness
of
his
discourse
,
have
bring
hisface
in
very
close
proximity

<EOS>
“For
<EOS>

”Jacob
<EOS>
Gray
then
pause
as

the
answer
of
Ada

to
hisgreat
surprise

aggravation

she
preserve
the

unbroken
silencewhich
she
have
dictate
to
herself
since
the
murder
at

lone

“You

bitterness

it
so

<EOS>
let
no
word
pass
between
us

<EOS>
I
can
construe
your
silence
<EOS>
—
you
feel
thatyou
must
obey
me

yet
you
can
not
bring
your
nature
to
give
me
oneword
of
acquiescence

Our

never

satisfactory

theircontinuance

You
may
preserve
your
silence

you
must
obey
me

before
this

I
have

now

Gray
pause
with
the

be
to
creep
cautiously

it

one
singing

how
strangely
the
tone
jar
upon
the

of
Jacob
Gray
:
the
sound
be
low
and
plaintive
,
and
to
him
itseeme
a
mockery
of
his
awful
situation
.
<EOS>
He
now
by
two
more

gain
the

to
forget

those
low

soft
strain
come
upon

<EOS>
the
female
be
evidently
singe

for
occasionally
she
wouldpause
to
express
some
word
of

to
the

her
song

<EOS>
the

tooth
withconcentrate
anger
.
<EOS>
the
question
now
be
whether
to
ascend
or
descendin
the
house
,
and
after
some
moment
of
anxious
consideration
,
hethought
his
well
chance
would
be
to
descend
,
and
make
an
effort
topass
himself
as
one
of
the
crowd
which
have
come
from
the
Strand
inpursuit
of
the
murderer

He
wipe
the
blood

from

arrange
his
disorder

hefancie
he
may
pass
muster
without
much
suspicion
,
as
he
wasconfident
none
of
those
who
follow
him
could
have
obtain
more
thana
transitory
glance
at
him
.
<EOS>
He
then
carefully
grope
his
way
in
the
pitchy
darkness
to
the
top
ofthe
stair
and
begin
slowly
to
descend
.
<EOS>
It
be
many
minute
before
he
reach

when

do

hefelt
for

along
it
towards

the
theme
oftheir

to

<EOS>
for
several
moment
now
Gray
stand
in
the
passage
quite
incapable
ofthought
or
action
;
his
only
impulse
be
by
a
kind
of
natural
instinctto
stand
as
close
to
the
damp
passage
wall
<EOS>
as
he
possibly
could
,
todecrease
the
chance
of
any
one
see
him
or
touch
him
in
the
actof
pass
.
<EOS>
His
brain
seem
to
be
in
a
complete
whirl
,
and
many
minute
must
haveelapse
before
he
acquire
a
sufficient
calmness
to
reflect
with
anydegree
of
rationality
upon
his
present
very
precarious
position
.
<EOS>
when
he
could
think
,
his
terror
by
no
means
decrease
;
for
whatplausible
course
of
action
be
there
now
open
to
him
,
as
he
could
notleave
the
house
?
<EOS>
the
thought
then
occur
to
him
,
that
if
he
couldmake
his
way
into
the
cellar
,
he
may
have
a
chance
of
lyingconceale
until
the
guard
at
the
door
be
remove
,
and
with
thisfeele
he
creep
along
the
passage
,
with
the
hope
of
find
somestaircase
lead
to
the
low
part
of
the
premise
.
<EOS>
He
be
still
engage
in
this
task
when
the
door
of
a
room
lead
intothe
passage
suddenly
open
,
and
a
flood
of
light
immediatelydissipate
the
pitchy
darkness
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
fortunately
for
him
,
Gray
be
within
one
pace
of
the
bottom
of
thestaircase
he
have
so
recently
descend
;
and
,
with
the
fear
of
instantdiscovery
upon
his
mind
,
from
the
person
who
be
come
with
the
light
,
he
bound
up
the
staircase
,
nor
pause
till
he
reach
the
firstlanding
,
<EOS>
from
whence
he
have
enter
the
room

the
mother
andher
child

<EOS>
there
he
stop
;
but
,
to
his
extreme
fright
,
the
flashing
of
the
lightevidently
indicate
that
its
bearer
be
come
up
the
stair
.
<EOS>
with
astifle
groan
Gray
cautiously
ascend
the
next
flight
,
and
againpause
on
the
narrow
landing
.
<EOS>
still
the
light
come
on
,
and
he
could
not
conceal
from
himself
the
factthat
the
person
be
still
ascend
,
and
that
he
have
no
other
resourcethan
to
continue
his
flight
to
the
very
upper
part
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
thenext
flight
of

be
steep
,
narrow
,
and
crazy
,
so
that
,
treadwhere
he
would
,
they
wheeze
,
creak
,
and
groan
under
the
pressureof
his
foot
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
however
,
no
resource
,
and
onward
he
go
,
until
he
wasstoppe
by
a
door
exactly
at
the
top
:
<EOS>
he
press
it
,
and
it
yield
tohis
touch
,
allow
him
to
enter
a
dark
attic
.
<EOS>
further
progress
Jacob
Gray
feel
there
could
not
be

and
he
stand
inthe
doorway
,
listen
attentively
if
he
could
detect
any
sound
ofapproaching
foot
.
<EOS>
a
gush
of
blood
to
his
heart
,
and
an
universal
tremor
of
all
his
limb
,
seize
him
as
he
see
the
light
come
,
and
feel
convinced
that
thedestination
of
the
person
approach
be
one
of
the
attic
,
if
not
thevery
one
he
have
seek
refuge
in

<EOS>
all
hope
appear
to
die
within
him

<EOS>
there
be
no
time
for
the
brief
reflection

with
his

he
retreat
backwards
into

crawl

come
down

here
Gray

to

he
said,—“There

”“no

no

I
could
do
that

<EOS>
”The
distance
be
scarcely
more
than
a
long
step
from

<EOS>
the
robber
now
slacken
out
some
of
the

then
,
with

hesprung
across

alight
in
safety
in
the
gutter
of
the
oppositehouse

<EOS>
“jump
now

he
say
to
Gray

<EOS>
the
distance
be
too
insignificant
to
give
occasion
for

stillGray
barely
clear
it

fall
in

”the
<EOS>
man
now
leave
Gray
to
his
meditation
after
carefully
lock
him
inthe
room
,
and
these
meditation
be
very
far
from
an

orpleasant
charae

<EOS>
Gray
’s
first
idea
be
that
he
would
hide
the
money
he
have
about
himwith
the
exception
of
the
amount
he
have
aver
to
,
namely
,
two
hundredpound
,
but
then
it
naturally
occur
to
him
how
extremely
improbableit
be
that
he
should
ever
have
an
opportunity
of
repossess
himselfof
it
.
<EOS>
“Still
,
"
he
answer
,
with
his
usual
selfish
cunning
;
"
still
there
maybe
a
remote
,
although
a
very
remote
chance
;
and
,
at

event
,
if
Inever
see
it
again
myself

I
may
prevent
these
man
from

it

”Deep
<EOS>
groan
then
burst
from
him
,

he
smote
his
breast
as
the
thoughtcame
across
him
that
all
the
gold
he
have
wrung
from
the
guilty
fear
ofLearmont

carefully

withthat

him
preferable

inaccessible

<EOS>
how
and
where
to

it
then
become
the
object

aboutin

<EOS>
Her

be
like
one
of
thosesudden
strange

which
occasionally
come
over
us
all
,
as
we
meetparticular
people
who
we
be
quite
sure
we
have
not
meet
before
,
but
whonevertheless
wear
not
the
aspect
of
stranger
to
us
;
people
whom
wecould
almost
imagine
we
have
be
intimate
with

insome
other
state
of

antecedent
to

<EOS>
on
occasion
of
this
singular
nature
too
,
there
will
always
be
a
dimperception
in
the
mind
concern
the
person
so
strangely
recognised;which
enable
us
to
say
,
with
certainty
,
whether
the
circumstancesconnecte
with
him
or
her
quite
unremembered

though
they
maybe

wereof
a
pleasing

downthe

with
the
full
expectation
of

something
come
whichmight
,
in
some
measure
,
account
for
Learmont
’s
sudden
and
extraordinaryflight
.
<EOS>
that
the
mere
sight
of
the
face
of
the
beautiful
girl
,
who
waswith
him
,
could
cause
such
an
excess
of
terror
,
he
could
not
imagine
,
and
when
a
servant
come
from
the
hall
,
and
say
to
him,—“What

<EOS>
the

He
then
destroy
a
number
of
letter

have
encumber
him

no
very
peculiarfeature

he

he
be
about

he
read
it
it
suggest
one
last
hope
to
his

the
reader
will
recollect
that
previous

apply

rich

not
a

anencourage
reply

Albert
could
follow
up
the
application

so
long
an
interval

Learmont

catch
his

make
him
in

desperate

the
sudden
notion
ofcalle

it
in

explain
the
cause
of
the
long
delay

may
interest
the

there

laymotionless

as

<EOS>
It
be
a
favourite
theory
of
dream
with
somephilosopher
,
that
such
vision
of
the
fancy
never
occur

at

or
two
before

at

or
in
other
word
that
we
dream
onlywhen
not

<EOS>
It
would
appear
that
this
be
the
case
with
Jacob
Gray
;
for
,
as
thebird
sing
above
him
,
and
the
sun
gleam
upon
him
,
while
a
crow
wouldoccasionally
flap
his
face
as
it
fly
over
him
,
his
perception
appearedhalf
to
return
,
and
his
face
become
bedew
with
a
heavy
perspiration
,
as
some
fearful
image
of
his
past
life
come
across
his
mental
vision
.
<EOS>
His
thought
be
evidently
wander
back
to
the
fearful
night
of
thefire
at
the
Old
Smithy
,
and
his
busy
fancy
be
enact
over
again
thatdreadful
drama
of
blood
.
<EOS>
He
toss
his
arm
wildly
to
and
fro
,
and
groan
and
uttered
thehalf
-
stifle
scream
which
come
from
a
disturbed
stupor
,
in
the
agonyof
his
mind
.
<EOS>
“save

<EOS>
"

oh

,
my

”He
<EOS>
then
,
in
his
intense
mental
suffering
,
bit
his
under
lip
till
theblood
trickle
on
to
his

,
and
with
the
actual
pain
he
awake
,
crying—“spare

<EOS>
oh

”He
<EOS>
open
his
eye
,
and
the
full
glare
of
the
sunlight
fall
upon
them
,
blind
him
for
the
moment
.
<EOS>
then
he
open
them
again
,
and
glancedaround
him
in
speechless
wonder
as
to
where
he
be
.
<EOS>
His
first
impression
be
that
he
be
dead
,
and
in
some
other
world
.
<EOS>
then
he
clasp
his
hand
over
his
face
and
then
try
to
think
.
<EOS>
but
aconfusion
and
want
of
image
in
his
brain
quite
render
such
an
effortvain
,
and
at
length
he
become
only
alive
to
so
horrible
a
sensation
ofthirst
that
he
shriek
aloud,—“water
—
water
<EOS>
—
water!”He
rise
to
his
knee
,
and
glare
around
him
with
his
parch
tonguehange
from
his
mouth
,
he
see
a
shine
sheet
of
limpid
water
at
somedistance
before
him
.
<EOS>
then
,
still
gasp
the
word
"
water
"
he
attemptedto
rise
,
but
so
confused
be
his
head
from
the
effect
of
the
opiatethat
have
be
so
unstintingly
administered
to
him
,
<EOS>
that
,
aftertottere
a
step
or
two
,
he
sink
to
the
earth
again
.
<EOS>
His
awful
thirstwas
however
,
unbearable
,
and
with
a
dizzy
brow
and
ache
eye
,
hecrawle
on
his
hand
and
knee
towards
the
pond
.
<EOS>
He
be
long
in

for
he
deviate
from

;
but
when

do
,
oh

what
an
exquisite
pleasure
<EOS>
it
be

dash
his

drink

<EOS>
not
till
his

be
exhaust
do
Jacob

raise

and
then
,
when
he
do
so
,
recollection
return
to
him
up
tothe
point
when
he
have
sit
down
to
supper
with

<EOS>
with
a
cry
that

something
unearthly
in

,
hehurriedly
thrust
his

into

then
with

he
grovel
on

”Oh

<EOS>
the
strain
be
amerry

jar
strangely
upon
the
half

madden
ear
of

who
have
just
sufficient
prudence
leave
him
to
feel
the
necessity
,
in
hispresent
position
,
of
not
give
any

for
he
feltthat

He
accordingly
rest

unconcerned

He
do
not

”the

”A

there

two
thing
that

one
be
,
that
his

,
that

the

who
have
so
fearlessly
denounce
him
,
he
have
make
sure
thathis
name

become
public

and
that
his
other
crime
of
recent
date
,
namely
,
the
murder
of
the
officer
Elias
,
in
the
house
at
Battersea
,
would
have
become
know
,
and
form
as
direct
and
distinct
a
chargeagainst
him
as
that
of
Vaughan
,
which
be
the

criminal
act
of

<EOS>
moreover
,
Sir
Francis

do
not
appear

which
be
as
great
a
surprise
to

<EOS>
the
necessity
for
some
immediate
movement
,
in
order
to
insure
hispersonal
safety
,
now
come
strongly
across
the
oppressed
and
waveringmind
of
Gray
,
and
hastily
tear
down
the
bill
from
the
tree
,
heclaspe
his
throb
temple
with
his
hand
,
and
strove
to
reduce
histhought
to
order
and
consistency
.
<EOS>
that
the
bill
-
sticker
have
go
toget
assistance
to
apprehend
him
,
be
the
frightful
notion
that
neverfor
one
instant
leave
his
mind
,
and
without
any
definite
notion
of
wherehe
<EOS>
be
go
,
he
go
round
the
declivity
of
the
hill
,
until
he
arrivedcompletely
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
the
only
mean
of
concealment
that
therepresente
itself
be
a
thick
hedge
,
but
then
he
think
how
veryinsecure
a
place
of
refuge
<EOS>
would
that
be
,
in
the
event
of
an
activesearch
be
make
for
him
.
<EOS>
the
country
before
him
be
level
for
a
considerable
distance
,
with
onlyhere
<EOS>
and
there
a
small
clump
of
tree
.
<EOS>
after
some
minute
more
ofpainful
think
an
idea
suggest
itself
to
him
,
which
be
very
much
inaccordance
with
his
usual
complicated
habit
of
thought
.
<EOS>
that
be
,
toleave
some
portion
of
his
apparel
on
the
bank
of
the
pond
,
to
induce
abelief
that
he
have
drown
himself
in
its
water
,
and
then
to
scrambleinto
one
of
the
tree
,
and
hide
till
nightfall
among
the
branch
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
only
feasible
plan
of
escape
that
suggest
itself
to
him
,
for
with
his
utter
ignorance
of
the
locality
of
the
field
,
anattempt
to
cross
them
to
the
village
would
most
probably
be
see
,
andbut
a
short
race
in
his
exhausted
and
sickly
state
would
ensure
hiscapture
.
<EOS>
"
at
night
,
"
he
think
,
"
I
will
venture
to
learmont’s
—
it
be
myonly
chance
.
<EOS>
I
will
then
offer
for
a
thousand
pound
to
deliver
up
Adato
him
,
and
he
still
suppose
,
probably
,
that
nothing
material
hashappene
,
<EOS>
may
consent
,
when
I
will
find
a
means
of
leave
England
forever
,
and
mature
at
my
leisure
plan
of
revenge
against
them
all
.
<EOS>
butnow
most
of
all
,
Ada
,
will
I
mark
you
well
.
<EOS>
You

who
have
reduce
me
tomy

my
bitter
malediction

<EOS>
I

work

even
the
iron
frame
of
Andrew
Britton

him
more
coarse

bloated
,
and
wayward
in
his
variousfancie

<EOS>
He
be
but
as
an
infant
in
the
interval
between
his
fit
ofdrunkenness
,
and
it
be
never
until
he
have
take

ardent
spiritsto
kill
any
ordinary
person
that
he
feel
his
energy

thefearful
excitement

delude
him
with
its

at

time
it
be
sap
the
very
spring
of
his
life
,
andweakene
the
foundation
of
his
strength
.
<EOS>
He
have
already
expend
a
small
fortune
at
the
Chequers
,
and
yet
hisgold
,
to
the
surprise
of
the
landlord
and
the
frequenter
of
the
house
,
appear
to
be
inexhaustible
.
<EOS>
endless
be
the
conjecture
of
who
andwhat
he
be
;
and
one
person
have
actually
call
upon
Sir
FrancisHartleton
to
mention
his
strong
suspicion
that
all
be
not
right
asregarde
Britton
;
but
we
know
that
the
magistrate
have
ample
andjudicious
reason
for
not
alarm
Learmont
by
a
useless
interferencewith
Andrew
Britton
;
and
although
he
receive
the
communication
withpoliteness
,
he
reply
that
he
see
no
reason
at
present
to
take
anystep
as
regard
the
drunken
smith
,
who
hold
his
nightly
orgy
at
theChequers
;
so
that
the
party
leave
his
office
rather
discourage
thanotherwise
,
and
Britton
pursue
his
career
unchecked
.
<EOS>
on
the
very
night
which

witness
the
denunciation
of
Jacob
Gray
byada
at
Whitehall

the
various
harrowing
incident

indirectly
arise
therefrom

Britton
have
be

inthe
parlour
of
the
Chequers
.
<EOS>
He
have
that
morning
visit
Learmont
,
and
be
now
freely
lavishingaround
him
the
gold
piece
,
which
appear
to
have
no
limit
,
but
to
beproduce
by
him
as
freely
as
if
he
have
discover
the
much
covetedsecret
of
the
transmutation
of

.
<EOS>
there
be
one
man
who
lately
Britton
have
take
much
to
,
and
that
be
onaccount
principally
of
his
wonderful
capacity
for
drink
,
in
which
hevie
with
the
smith
himself
.
<EOS>
this
man
be
a
butcher
,
reside
in
theimmediate
vicinity
,
and
in
every
respect
he

indeed
a

,
and

<EOS>
,
he

in
himselfall
that

and
as
he
have
no

,
and
Britton
hadplenty
,
which
he
be
,
moreover
,
willing
to
spend
freely
,
they
becamequite

LXV.An
Interview
with
a
Secretary
of
state.—sir
Francis
hartleton’sdifficultie
.
<EOS>
in
order
to
explain
the
cause
of
the
singular
interruption
whichoccurre
to
the
festive
scene
at
the
Chequers
,
we
must
glance
at
theproceeding
of
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
for
the
precede
two
day
.
<EOS>
We
have
before
hint
at
the
very
awkward
position
in
which
Sir
FrancisHartleton
be
place
as
a
magistrate
,
have
suspicion
of
the
verystrong
mature
for
suspect
some
foul
crime
on
the
part
ofLearmont
,
Andrew
Britton
,
and
the
man
Gray
,
of
whose
existence
andidentification
with
the
third
in
the
iniquitous
proceeding
he
have
onlylately
have
good
reason
to
believe
,
and
yet
such
suspicion
not
assuminga
sufficiently
tangible
form
to
enable
him
to
find
a
charge
upon
him
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
work
as
he
be
in
the
dark
in
try
to
unravel
aplot
the
intricacy
of
which
seem
to
him
to
increase
instead
ofdiminish
as
he
dive
into
it
,
he
never
know
but
what
some
false
step
ofhis
—
some
effort
of
over
-
zeal
may
put
the
guilty
party
not
only
ontheir
guard
of
him
particularly
,
but
may
set
them
to
work
to
takemore
effectual
step
than
they
have
hitherto
do
for
the
suppression
ofevery
particle
of
tangible
evidence
against
them
,
but
may
likewiseinduce
deep
and
blacker
crime
than
any
they
have
yet
attempt
orcommitte
for
the
preservation
of
secret
essential
to
their
existence
.
<EOS>
thus
it
be
that
although
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
have
a
strong
perceptionof
the
main
fact
of
the
case
he
have
in
hand
as
regard
the
guilt
ofLearmont
,
yet
he
feel
that
he
could
not
be
too
cautious
in
what
he
saidor
do
consequent
thereon
,
until
some
circumstance
should
arise
to
givea
direct
clue
to
such
a
chain
of
evidence
as
should
enable
him
at
onceto
pounce
upon
them
all
,
and
insure
their
condemnation
on
irrefragibleproofs
.
<EOS>
after
his
first
interview
with
Albert
Seyton
,
he
have
carefully
make
anarrative
of
all
the
circumstance
connect
with
the
affair
,
and
as
itwill
be
recollect
that
by
that
interview
,
he
be
enable
to
placetogether
the
name
of
Gray
,
Britton
,
and
Learmont
,
in
such
a
manner
asto
be
certain
that
they
be
then
,
or
have
be
,
engage
in
some
greatact
of
villany
together
,
he
be
in
a
much
well
situation
for
arrivingat
a
correct
conclusion
with
regard
to
the
various
circumstance
<EOS>
thatcame
crowd
upon
his
recollection
.
<EOS>
that
some
crime
,
most
probably
a
murder
,
have
be
commit
so
manyyear
ago
when
he
,
a
young
man
,
have
more
passion
and
impetuositythan
discretion
,
reside
in
the
village
of
Learmont
on
the
night
of
thefire
at
the
Old
Smithy
,
he
never
entertain
a
doubt
,
and
theprobability
that
have
he
be
a
private
individual
and
not
an
open
enemyas
<EOS>
it
be
of
Learmont
<EOS>
’s
,
he
would
have
make
some
effort
of
perhaps
ahazardous
and
illegal
nature
to
obtain
satisfaction
on
the
affair
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
,
however
,
be
one
of
those
who
feel
deeply
theresponsibilitie
of
the
situation
in
which
he
be
place
as
one
of
theminister
of
justice
,
and
he
would
have
consider
himself
as
quiteunfit
for
so
onerous
<EOS>
an
office
have
he
act
from
impulse
instead
ofreflection
in
the
prosecution
of
evil
-
doer
.
<EOS>
thus
,
although
ferrettingthe
while
,
he
wait
until
something
should
occur
to
point
him
a
clearand
consistent
path
in
the
investigation
.
<EOS>
His
own
suspicion
be
simply
these
.
<EOS>
that
Learmont
have
,
by
theassistance
of
the
savage
smith
and
the
man
who
have
rush
from
theburne
house
with
the
child
,
commit
some
great
crime
for
the
sakeeither
of
still
for
ever
some
evidence
of
precede
criminality
,
orfor
some
then
present
gain
or
pecuniary
advantage
,
and
hence
AndrewBritton
’s
<EOS>
constant
visit
to
Learmont
be
for
probable
claim
upon
hispurse
.
<EOS>
that
Jacob
Gray
be
the
man
who
have
so
rush
from
the
burn
smithy
,
and
that
Ada
be
the
child
he
have
in
his
arm
,
Sir
Francis
,
after
whatwas
relate
to
him
by
Albert
Seyton
,
feel
almost
assure
of
,
and
thatboth
Gray
and
Britton
be
now
prey
upon
Learmont
,
he
feel
convinced
.
<EOS>
all
this
,
however
,
do
not
amount
to
much
,
and
although
greatlystrengthene
his
own
previous
suspicion
of
foul
play
somewhere
,
afford
him
no
information
as
a
magistrate
.
<EOS>
He
could
make
no
specificcharge
against
Learmont
.
<EOS>
He
have
nothing
to
say
to
Britton
,
and
Gray
hehad
never
be
able
to
catch
hold
of
,
or
he
would
have
make
an
attemptto
possess
himself
of
the
paper
address
to
him
,
which
he
thoughtmore
than
probably
contain
ample
information
.
<EOS>
He
be
likewise
move
strongly
by
the
picture
Albert
Seyton
have
drawnof
the
persecution
endure
by
Ada
,
and
set
apart
all
otherconsideration
,
he
be
most
anxious
to
rescue
her
from
the
ill
bywhich
she
be
surround
.
<EOS>
thus
he
want
to
discover
two
thing
principally
.
<EOS>
the
one
be
whatcrime
have
be
commit
at
the
Old
Smithy
;
and
the
other
be
,
presume
Ada
to
be
the
child
see
on
that
memorable
occasion
—
who
wasshe?To
neither
of
these
question
could
he
give
himself
a
rational
answer
,
and
he
be
therefore
force
to
endeavour
to
comfort
himself
in
theaffair
by
set
a
watch
over
Britton
,
another
on
Learmont
,
and
makingwhat
exertion
he
could
himself
to
ferret
out
the
abode
of
Jacob
Gray
,
without
excite
the
suspicion
of
Learmont
.
<EOS>
several
time
the
thought
of
an
active
search
in
the
ruin
of
the
OldSmithy
at
Learmont
have
suggest
itself
to
his
mind
,
but
have
beenrejecte
upon
the
conviction
that
such
a
proceeding
would
be
verypublic
,
and
could
not
be
undertake
by
him
as
a
magistrate
,
withoutsome
valid
previous
excuse
.
<EOS>
on
the
day
,
however
,
that
he
consider
himself
so
fortunate
as
to
haveunearthed
Jacob
Gray
,
and
to
have
him
all
but
in
his
grasp
,
Sir
FrancisHartleton
resolve
to
bring
affair
to
some
sort
of
crisis
,
and
adoptreluctantly
the
only
plan
that
present
itself
to
him
,
of
secure
thesafety
of
Ada
and
the
punishment
of
two
out
of
three
criminal
,
andthat
be
to
arrest
Britton
on
that
day
,
and
,
confront
him
with
Gray
,
induce
a
clear
confession
from
one
or
the
other
of
them
,
under
apromise
of
relief
from
capital
punishment
.
<EOS>
He
,
act
upon
this
feeling
,
procure
ample
assistance
,
and
previousto
start
for
Gray
’s
house
in
the
marsh
of
Battersea
<EOS>
,
he
instructedone
of
his
experienced
officer
to
make
sure
of
the
rapture
of
Brittonbefore
night
.
<EOS>
His
disappointment
at
Forest
’s
house
<EOS>
we
be
aware
of
,
and
immediatelyupon
his
return
,
he
be
careful
to
countermand
the
order
for
Britton’sarrest
.
<EOS>
this
countermand
,
however
,
be
give
to
an
officer
who
wasseriously
hurt
in
a
common
street
affray
before
he
could
communicatehis
message
to
him
who
have
the
particular
charge
to
capture
the
smith
.
<EOS>
hence
it
arise
that
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
be
not
aware
that
measureswere
take
to
apprehend
Britton
,
until
it
be
almost
too
late
toprevent
it
.
<EOS>
He
,
nevertheless
,
make
the
attempt
,
and
be
as
we
haveseen
,
just
in
time
personally
to
stop
the
arrest
,
for
it
be
he
himselfwho
cry
"
no
!
"
<EOS>
in
the
parlour
of
the
Chequers
,
be
this
timeeffectually
disguise
from
the
observation
of
Britton
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
then
immediately
return
to
his
own
house
,
where
he
hadnot
long
be
,
when
he
hear
rapidly
,
one
after
the
other
,
of
the
twoastounde
event
of
the
fire
at
the
lone
house
by
Battersea
,
and
thedenunciation
of
a
man
,
by
a
young
and
beautiful
girl
,
near
CharingCross
,
as
a
murderer
.
<EOS>
the
thought
immediately
flash
across
his
mind
that
this
man
must
bejacob
Gray
,
and
his
accuser
the
persecute
Ada
.
<EOS>
a
very
short
time
,
aswe
be
aware
,
convince
him
that
his
suspicion
be
well
-
found
,
andhis
main
cause
of
anxiety
be
remove
,
he
now
resolve
to
lend
allhis
energy
to
discover
who
Ada
be
,
and
bring
home
the
crime
ofLearmont
and
his
associate
to
them
.
<EOS>
the
whole
affair
have
now
assume
so
new
and
troublesome
an
aspect
,
thatSir
Francis
Hartleton
think
it
necessary
to
apply
to
the
Secretary
ofstate
for
sanction
to
the
proceeding
he
may
wish
to
adopt
.
<EOS>
His
wish
be
that
the
pursuit
after
Jacob
Gray
may
not
be
active
,
butthat
he
should
be
rather
leave
alone
for
a
time
,
under
a
strictsurveillance
,
to
see
what
he
would
do
,
and
how
far
he
may
commit
hisassociate
by
visit
and
communication
with
them
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
wishedthe
case
of
Andrew
Britton
to
be
entirely
leave
in
his
hand
,
for
theviolent
proceeding
of
the
savage
smith
have
begin
to
excite
theattention
of
other
of
the
local
authority
,
and
he
,
Sir
FrancisHartleton
,
be
fearful
that
some
imprudent
step
may
be
take
by
someother
magistrate
concern
Britton
and
his
mysterious
wealth
,
whichmight
alarm
<EOS>
Learmont
before
he
wish
him
to
be
at
all
alarm
.
<EOS>
with
these
view
and
feeling
,
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
repair
to
thesecretary
of
State
,
with
whom
he
have
an
immediate
interview
,
and
towhom
he
carefully
detail
all
the
circumstance
which
be
within
hisknowledge
,
concern
Ada
and
her
fortune
,
from
the
night
of
the
fireat
the
Old
Smithy
at
Learmont
,
to
the
time
when
she
have
take
refuge
athis
house
,
conclude
by
saying,—“Sir
,
I
have
,
from
a
record
of
all
the
circumstance
,
the
strongestreason
to
believe
that
this
young
girl
be
the
same
,
who
,
when
aninfant
,
be
carry
from
the
burn
ruin
by
the
blood
-
stainedshrieking
man
,
but
still
I
have
no
proof
;
I
believe
that
Jacob
Gray
isthat
man
,
but
still
I
have
no
proof
;
I
believe
that
a
murder
wascommitte
that
night
at
the
smithy
,
but
still
I
have
no
proof
;
andmoreover
,
by
Gray
’s
subsequent
crime
<EOS>
,
we
be
now
entirely
cut
off
fromoffere
him
any
merciful
consideration
for
a
full
and
free
confessionof
the
whole
of
the
circumstance
,
and
Britton
<EOS>
,
I
fear
,
be
not
the
manto
confess
at
all
;
if
he
be
,
he
be
most
probably
awfully
and
deeplyimplicate
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
what
I
wish
of
you
,
sir

be
authority
to
stopproceeding
against
Gray
,
for
the
present
,
and
to
leave
him
at

”“upon

not

wild

not

emaciated
appearance
attract
the
noticeof
any
one
along
the
dimly
light
road
from
Hampstead
to
London

<EOS>
although
his
strength
be
now
a
little
restored
,
he
still
feel
very
illat
every
step
of
his
progress
,
and
his
only
hope
become
entirelyfounde
upon
the
chance
of
find
Learmont
within
,
and
induce
in
hima
belief
that
his
(
Gray
’s
)
strange
and
disorder
appearance
arosemerely
from
some
accident
on
his
road
,

not
from
any
circumstanceswhich
have
put
it
out
of
his

to
be
half
so
noxious

dangerousas
he
have
be

if
when
I

Learmont
he

be
without

without

topoint
the
finger

how
his
finger
would
closeupon
my

and
<EOS>
what
music
to
his
ear
would
be
my
death
rattle

ButI
must
deceive
him

I
must

”It
<EOS>
be
some
hour

Jacob

to
feel
some
vague
sort
of
apprehension
that
therewas
danger
at

and
that
he
be
watch
by
party
who
come
and
satdown
with
apparent
jollity
in

old
parlour
of
the
Chequers

himself
to
death
some
day
andleave
behind
him
ample
write
evidence
to
convict
him
,
Learmont

ofheavy
crime

and
exultation
that
all
the
money

convert
into
the

of
his
destruction

himself

he
consider
how
ridiculously

allow
his
imagination
to
run
riot
in
creatingapprehension
,
perhaps
after
all

to

completely
dissipate

Surmises.—An
Adventure

<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
find
but
very
little
difficulty
in
gettingpossession
of
Ada
’s
necklace
from
the
Jew
,
who
have
make
so
capital
abargain
with
her
.
<EOS>
the
wily
Israelite
make
a
practice
of
neverpurchase
an
article
unless
he
get
it
at
a
price
which
always
impliedthat
it
be
dishonestly
come
by
,
as
be
the
case
with
Ada
,
of
someparty
totally
ignorant
or
the
value
of
the
commodity
.
<EOS>
another
rule
of
his
business
be
to
keep
his
great
bargain
someyear
,
if
he
think
it
necessary
so
to
do
,
before
he
bring
them
intothe
market
,
so
that
if
the
jewel
or
the
gold
be
steal
,
all
theexcitement
concern
it
have
subside
,
and
the
very
person
from
whomthe
property
have
be
filch
have
long
since
give
it
up
as
quitehopeless
.
<EOS>
in
this
manner
,
he
have
act
with
regard
to
Ada
’s
necklace
,
which
wasreally
worth
a
much
large
sum
than
either
Jacob
Gray
or
the
Jewimagined
,
for
the
former
know
only
from
indirect
source
the
value
ofthe
article
,
and
the
latter
rarely
come
across
anything
so
pure
andcostly
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
Jacob
Gray
have
a
strong
motive
for
preserve
the
necklace
,
because
,
as
we
know
,
he
always
look
forward
to
a
day
when
it
may
benecessary
or
agreeable
to
him
to
declare
Ada
’s
name
,
birth
,
andlineage
;
and
thus
how
important
may
any
corroborative
evidence
becomeupon
the
subject
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
Jew
,
he
have
be
in
a
ceaseless
wonder
ever
since
he
hadpurchase
the
valuable
trinket
of
the
young
girl
,
and
in
vain
hepuzzle
himself
to
account
for
her
possession
of
it
,
and
form
some
ideaof
who
she
could
possibly
be
that
be
wander
about
alone
with
suchvaluable
property
;
and
it
be
more
than
possible
that
his
great
bargainwas
as
great
a
source
of
disquiet
to
him
as
it
be
of
congratulation
,
for
he
reason
with
himself,—“If
sho
be
hash
<EOS>
she
have
such
a
necklace
,
and
do
not
know
fot
it

sho
help

,
she
may
have
have
something
else
petter
still

<EOS>
”This
be
a
sore
reflection
to
the
Jew
,
and
on
the
whole
afford
a
finecommentary
upon
such
motive
as
his
who
rate
their
loss
by
theirgain
,
in
the
same
manner
as
the
man
who
find
half

a

the
one
,
and
bemoan
to
everybody
his
loss
ofthe
other

<EOS>
It
be
a
sore
blow
to
the
Jew
,
when
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
walk
intohis
shop
,
and
at
once
announce
himself
as
the
much
dreaded
,
becauseactive
and
irreproachable
,
magistrate
,
demand
the
necklace
,
give
adescription
of
it
,
and
of
Ada
,
which
render
any
kind
of
shuffling
outof
the
matter
of
no
possible
use
.
<EOS>
the
necklace
be
therefore
produce
,
and
Sir
Francis
leave
the
Jew
fullyimpresse
with
a
belief
that

would
immediately
be
prosecute

such
a
step
be
still
far
from

be
take

that

as

to
offer
for
two

as
well

Jacob

leave
England
for

Learmont
may
see
him
onboard

findAda

at

sufficient
to

not

by

his

at
least
,
secure
to
himself
safety

and
the
mean
of
live
incomparative
luxury
in
some
cheap
continental
state

<EOS>
if

such
a
compromise

he
could
adopt
some
othercourse
of
action
to

upon

,
upon
the
necessity
of
leave

,
and
that
quickly
too
,
hewa
quite
clear
and
decide

<EOS>
one
would
have
think
that
Jacob
Gray
have
meet
with
sufficientdisappointment
in
his
various
arrangement
to
dishearten
him
fromattempte
further
to
create
circumstance
,
and
philosophise
upon

;
but
it
be
a
fix
principle
in
those
nature
which
be
fond
toexcess
of

,
that
no
experience
will
deter
them
from
concoctingthe
hairbreadth
scheme
and
chance
which
would
,
combine
,
make
up
asatisfactory
result
,
but
which
all
possess
the
one
alarm
feature
,
that
the
whole
fabric
must
topple
down
upon
the
displacement
of
asingle
brick
.
<EOS>
He
rise
from
the
step
of
the
door
,
and
walk
onwards
,
he
know
notwhither
,
for
some
time
;
but
,
at
length
,
he
find
himself
inparliament
-
street
,
from
the
immediate
vicinity
of
which
he
shrunkquickly
,
for
he
dread
the
glare
of
the
light
,
and
fear
that
someone
may
recognise
him
as
the
fugitive
of
the
Strand
.
<EOS>
there
be
in
his
mind
some
strange
and
singular
contradiction
withregard
to
his
present
situation
,
<EOS>
which
,
as
calm
reflection
come
to
hisaid
,
he
find
it
very
difficult
indeed
to
reconcile
.
<EOS>
that
Ada
have
seek
refuge
with
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
he
couldscarcely
permit
himself
to
doubt
for
a
moment
;
but
then
theconsequence
which
she
have
always
dread
from
such
a
step
on

parthad
certainly
not
increase
so
rapidly
if
they
be
to
occur
at
all
,
ashe
would
have
swear
they
would
.
<EOS>
He
anticipate
so
active
,
sopersevering
,
so
energetic
a
hunt
from
him
throughout
,
not
only
themetropolis
,
but
the
whole
kingdom
,
when
once
Ada
should
be
in
acondition
to
possess
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
of
the
event
of
the
fiveyear
of
her
life
with
him
,
Gray
,
that
safety
and
freedom
for
four
andtwenty
hour
be
a
thing
not
to
be
think
of
;
and
yet
here
he
be
,
without
much
disguise
,
without
the
mean
of
take
that
care
to
avoidsuspicion
which
he
would
fain
have
do
,
free
and
unquestioned
hithertoin
the

.
<EOS>
His

seem
in

<EOS>
there
be
no
hue

cry
—
<EOS>
no

particular

save
the
meagre
one
he
have
seenat
Hampstead

which
have
evidently
not
emanate
from

<EOS>
in

,

<EOS>
Jacob

therefore

under

uponseveral
supposition
—
none
of
which
,
however
,
to
his

bear
the
stampof
much
probability
.
<EOS>
one
be
that
Ada
have
not
take
refuge
with
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
butby
<EOS>
some
mean
have
fall
into
other
hand
,
who
do
not
feel
sointerested
in
her
story
or
have
not
the
power
or
the
inclination
to
actupon
any
of
the
surmise
it
must
naturally
call
forth
.
<EOS>
another
supposition
,
be
,
that
from
some
linger
feeling
of
pitytoward
him
,
or
from
some
dark
and
haunting
suspicion
in
her
mind
<EOS>
thathe
may
be
relate
to
her
,
she
have
,
although
with
Sir
Francis
,
abstain
from
commit
him
Gray
sufficiently
to
induce
a
hot
pursuitfor
him
,
on
other
ground
than
the
murder
of
Elias
,
and
of
Vaughan
.
<EOS>
nay
,
he
even
think
it
possible
that
Ada
may
have
intercede
for
himto
be
leave
alone
,
or
bargain
in
some
way
for
his
safety
.
<EOS>
but
as
oftena
these
reflection
begin
to
shed
some
comforting
influence
on
Gray
,
there
come
the
reflection
of
how
firmly
and
broadly
she
have
denouncedhim
as
a
murderer
in
the
public
street
,
and
he
become
lose

in

and

He

as
these
painful
thought

which
seemedaccommodate
itself
to
his
in
a
manner
that
excite

<EOS>
all
Gray

vanish

a

perspiration
break
out
upon
him
,
as
hefancied
he

for

<EOS>
He
still
hear
the

fear
to

after

the

this

be
a

object
togray

it

afford
him
an

proceed
some

he
just
glance
over

go

neither

Jacob
Gray

however
be
reckon
without

didthe
troublesome
shoemaker

who
be
the
pest
of
Westminster

from
hislove
of

with
the
duty
of

<EOS>
strongly
suspect

have
hit

he
determine
not

have
merely
ensconce
himself
in

get
some
distance
off

his

be
to
follow
him
verycautiously
till
he
see
him
house
somewhere

he
do

that
would

singular
an
hour

some
money

<EOS>
He
could
easily
frame
some
lie
to

anhour

then
,
before

a
sum
nearly
approach
totwenty
guinea
in
it
,
and
a
ghastly
smile
same
across
his
face
,
as
,
bythe
mere
possession
of
money
,
he
feel
,
or
fancy
he

considerablystronger
and
well
than

<EOS>
He
walk
with
a
firm
step
and
an
air
of
great

of
his

refreshment
without

<EOS>
It
be
strange
how
intense
mental
anxiety
will
overcome
and
smotheralmost
entirely
the
consciousness
of

<EOS>
so
it

with

now
that
he
have
money
inhis

and
fancy
he

light
in
the
darkness
of
fate
,
he
beganto
experience
great
agony
from
the
wound
,
and
previous
to
seekingrefreshment
or
rest
he
wish
to

surgical

CHAPTER
LXXIV.Ada

’s
Home.—A
Happy
scene.—the
Serenity
of
Goodness
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
on
that
same
evening
be
immerse
in
deep
thoughon
Ada
’s
prospect
and
affair
.
<EOS>
so
multifarious
and
complex
have
evenwhat
<EOS>
he
know
concern
her
and
her
fortune
become
,
put
aside
allthat
he
surmise
,
that
now
he
have
repair
to
his
own
quiet
littleroom
,
in
which
he
be
never
interrupt
and
sit
down
,
as
much
for
thecleare
of
his
own
mind
upon
the
subject
,
as
for
any
otherconsideration
,
to
write
in
detail
all
the
various
circumstancesconnecte
with
the
history
and
fortune
of
Ada
.
<EOS>
when
he
come
fairly
to
separate
what
he
know
from
what
he
only
surmisedhe
feel
much
disappointed
at
the
limited
fact
that
really
appearedupon
paper
,
and
as
we
have
before
intimate
,
he
find
himself
in
thedisagreeable
position
of
suspect
much
and
know
little
—
able
tosurmise
much
more
than
he
could
prove
,
and
morally
certain
of
manything
which
he
despair
of
ever
find
the
mean
of
make
clear
byproof
.
<EOS>
the
connection
of
Learmont
with
the
same
crime
in
which
Gray
andBritton
have
be
participator
be
very
clear
,
but
could
he
specifythose
crime
?
<EOS>
It
be
not
enough
to
say—“so
and
so
be
a
criminal
,
"
butit
be
necessary
to
tell
and
define
such
a
charge
;
and
Sir
FrancisHartleton
feel
keenly
all
the
advantage
which
such
a
man
as
Learmontwould
have
over
him
,
be
he
to
make
a
loose
and
unsupported
attackagainst
him
.
<EOS>
have
finish
his
narrative
,
Sir
Francis
sit
in
deep
thought
for
morethan
an
hour
,
but
yet
could
not
form
any
satisfactory
conclusion
,
nordetermine
upon
any
course
of
action
which
would
not
be
attend
withwhat
<EOS>
he
consider
the
bad
consequence
of
all
,
namely
,
puttinglearmont
thoroughly
upon
his
guard
.
<EOS>
He
foresee
that
he
could
not
persevere
,
for
a
very
long
period
of
time
,
upon
the
unwilling
and
rather
unprecedented
power
give
to
him
by
thesecretary
of
State
,
but
that
Jacob
Gray
must
shortly
be
apprehend
forthe
murder
of
Vaughan
,
when
it
be
more
than
probable
that
<EOS>
all
chanceof
discover
Ada
’s
real
history
through
him
would
be
lose
;
for
whatinducement
could
be
offer
to
such
a
man
as
Gray
to
do
an
act
ofjustice
,
when
his
own
life
could
not
by
any
possibility
be
spare
,
butmust
be
take
by
the
hand
of
the
law
for
a
clear
and
distinctmurder,—not
to
take
into
consideration
the
assassination
of
Elias
,
inthe
lone
house
at
Battersea
.
<EOS>
It
have
more
than
once
occur
to
the
mind
of
the
magistrate
to
searchthe
ruin
of
the
house
in
which
Gray
have
reside
,
but
then
,
as
often
,
the
extreme
improbability
of
such
a
man
leave
anything
behind
him
ofa
character
to
criminate
him
in
any
way
,
save
the
dead
body
of
themurdere
officer
,
come
so
strongly
across
him
that
he
reject
asuseless
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
the
smithy
,
too
,
at
Learmont
he
long
to
search
effectually
,
but
howcould
he
do
so
without
observation
in
such
a
place
;
and
should
such
aproceede
come
to
the
ear
of
Learmont
<EOS>
,
he
may
well
complain
of
atrespass
upon
his
own
premise
,
for
the
purpose
of
endeavour
to
getup
some
charge
against
him
of
a
secret
and
undeclared
nature
.
<EOS>
“No
,
"
exclaim
Hartleton
,
with
disappointment
,
as
he
rise
from
hischair
,
"
I
must
not
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
resource
but
patience
,
and
,
for
a
shorttime
,
this
man
Gray
,
with
all
his
crime
upon
his
head
,
must
besuffered
to
remain
at
large
,
unless
some
meddle
person
apprehend
himupon
suspicion
merely
,
in
which
case
the
law
must
take
its
course
;
foralthough
I
can
and
may
take
no
step
to
make
him
a
prisoner
,
I
dare
notdischarge
him
if
once
take
.
<EOS>
”As
<EOS>
we
have
mention
,
it
be
mere
humanity
which
induce
Sir
FrancisHartleton
to
order
poor
Maud
to
be
bring
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
farindee
from
suspect
her
possession
of
the
important
scrap
of
JacobGray
’s
write
confession
,
which
she
have
rescue
from
among
the
charredrafter
of
the
house
at
Battersea
and
he
receive
the
report
of
theofficer
,
who
have
be
commission
to
find
her
to
the
effect
that
hehad
not
yet
be
able
to
take
her
,
without
much
feeling
upon
thesubject
,
engross
as
his
mind
be
with
other
matter
.
<EOS>
after
thus
turn
the
whole
affair
over
in
his
mind
,
and
,
for
thepresent
resolve
to
do
nothing
,
but
wait
and
see
what
the
chapter
ofaccident
would
bring
forth
Sir
Francis
leave
his
study
,
and
seek
thesociety
of
his
young
and
amiable
wife
and
Ada
.
<EOS>
during
the
very
short
residence
of
Ada
with
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
andhis
lady
,
she
have
endear
herself
greatly
to
them
.
<EOS>
Her
love
oftruth
—
her
earnest
depreciation
of
every
wrong
,
and
the
sweet
simplicityof
her
character
have
place
her
so
high
in
their
esteem
,
that
they
hadresolve
she
should
never
leave
the
friendly
shelter
of
the
roof
,
unless
circumstance
should
arise
to
place
her
in
a
happy
home
of
herown
.
<EOS>
from
all
these
circumstance
and
conclusion
,
it
will
be
see
that
notone
of
our
character
,
variously
situate
as
they
be
,
have
great
causefor
congratulation
on
their
prospect
,
with
the
exception
of
Ada
,
towhom
<EOS>
it
be
a
new
and
beautiful
existence
to
be
free
from
thepersecution
of
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
one
sad
spot
in
the
younggirl
’s
heart
now
,
and
that
be
,
that
loving
,
respect
,
and
admiringas
<EOS>

do
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
and
his
lady
<EOS>
,
she
do
not
feel
forthem
what
she
feel
for
Albert
Seyton
;
and
many
,
very
many
of
thegushe
feeling
of
her
heart
be
constrain
to
calmness
and
merecourtesy

because
she

the
enthusiastic

<EOS>
Sir

it

matter
as
well
as
great

the
fate
wouldnever
have
do
persecute
him
,
for
he
have
not
notice
that
his

minus
a

and
the
consequence
be
that
Jacob
Gray
come
down
onthe
floor
with
a
great
noise
,
which
be
more
than
sufficient
to
alarmanybody
in

<EOS>
He
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
rise
instantly
,

fly
to
the
window

then
the
risk
of
traverse

in
broad
daylight

which
itnow
very
nearly

come
across

recoil
from

that
in

probability
,
his
least
danger
lie
in
remainingwhere
he
be

endeavour

excite

some
spurious
tale
thecompassion
of
the
person

<EOS>
His
heart
,
however
,
feel
sick
and
faint
as
he
wait
in
tremblingexpectation
of
some
one
come
;
and
as
minute
after
minute
rolledonward
,
leave
him
still
alone
,
he
feel
it
would
be
a
relief
to
hismind
if
they
would
come
at
once
,
and
not
leave
him
on
the
rack
ofapprehension

<EOS>
His
sense
become
powerfully
acute
to
the
least
noise

once
ortwice
he
fancy
he
hear

creaking
noise
upon

dreadful
apprehension
come
across

arm
with

perhaps
,
a
blunderbuss

Jacob

his

at

by
a
death
of
agony

<EOS>
the
moment

begin
to
haunt
him
he
look
around
him
for
some
place
oftemporary
concealment

and
observe
a
cupboard
at
one
end

he
glide
cautiously
towards
it

take
refuge
within

should
hear

by

voice

and

deep
furrow
on
his
cheek
,
which

of
that

,
if
colour
it
couldbe
call
at
all
,
that
the
former
sallow
tint
of
his
complexion
hadrecently

way
to
.
<EOS>

appearance
altogether
as

in
a
chair
,

back
ofwhich

against
the
wall
with
a
table
and
write
materialsbefore
him
,
he
look
a
man
to
be
shun
or
pity
,
accord
as
theobserver
may
translate
his
look
to
imply
disease
of
body
,
or
thatworse
disease
of

mind
result
from
a
perturbed
conscience
.
<EOS>
He

,
in
reply
tohis

in
a
hollow

from
the
grave,—“Good

,
young

<EOS>
”“Good

,
"
reply

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
”“Yes

"
mutter
Learmont
,
lean
his
head
upon
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
You

,
and
punctual
—
very
punctual

"
<EOS>
He
then
seem
to
fall
into
a
fit
ofabstraction
,
and
add
,
"
He
be
not
here
.
<EOS>
Can
he
have
take
alarm
?
<EOS>
or
hewill
be
here
anon?”“Sir

"
say
Albert
.
<EOS>
Learmont
start
,
exclaiming,—“Who
spoke?”“I
think
you
address
me
,
sir?”“No
—
no
<EOS>
—
I
—
I
—
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
be
very
young
,
and
yet

you
say?”“there

,

into
the
brief
space
of

"
reply
Albert
.
<EOS>
"
I
have

all
that

<EOS>
”“All
?
"
echo
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
sir
,
all
,
"
sigh
Albert
.
<EOS>
“You
have
no
tie
then
to
bind
you
to
the
world
,
and
make
you
pause
inany
undertaking
?
<EOS>
You
be
like
me
,
a
lone
man
.
<EOS>
I
be
lone
,
and
quitedesolate
;
but
I
pride
myself
upon
my
isolation
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
besurrounde
by
what
the
mass
of
mankind
rejoice
in
,
in
the
shape
ofconnexion
,
for
world
.
<EOS>
”albert
say
nothing
,
and
,
after
a
pause
,
Learmont
add
,
hastily,—“you
bear
in
mind
our
conversation
of
yesterday?”“I
<EOS>
do
,
sir
,
and
be
ready
to
perform
the
honourable
service
youmentione
to
me
.
<EOS>
”albert
lay
some
stress
upon
the
word
honourable
,
and
Learmont
reply
,
coldly,—“Well
,
sir
,
it
be
honourable
service
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
know
it
be
,
sir
.
<EOS>
”“You
know
it

.
<EOS>
”“Yes
<EOS>
,
sir
—
I
know
it
be
so
,
or
,
as
the
son
of
a
soldier
and
a
gentleman
,
I
should
never
have
have
it
propose
to
me
by
you
.
<EOS>
”A
<EOS>
sneer
pass
over
Learmont
’s
face
as
he
said,—“My
young
friend
,
soldier
,
and
gentleman
,
and
their
son
,
be
not
alla
particular
as
you

<EOS>
”“I
be
sorry
for
it
,
sir

<EOS>
”“Nay
,
why
should
you
be

<EOS>
among

you
not

'
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
well
that
some
soldier
and
gentleman
be
not
so
veryscrupulous
;
for
do
not
you
see
,
young
sir
,
that
it
make
your
greatvirtue
shine
with
double
lustre
.
<EOS>
”albert
<EOS>
do
not
wholly
relish
the
tone
of
irony
in
which
this
be
say
,
and
his
cheek
slightly
flush
as
he
replied,—“It
be
unbecoming
in
me
to
dispute
with
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
”there
be
a
silence
of
some
moment
’
duration
,
and
then
Learmont
say
,
abruptly,—“You
will
follow
the
man
home
upon
whose
track
I
will
put

<EOS>
”“I
will
do
my

”“Do

and
your
reward
will
be
commensurate
with

<EOS>
Surelyhe

<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
hope
you
will
find
him
honest
than
you
suppose
him
to

Albert
.
<EOS>
“You
hope
I

<EOS>
May
all
the
torment
of

I

<EOS>
no

”“Sir

from
the
basilisk
glance
of
Learmont

simple

<EOS>
I
have
but
to
obey
your
honourable
order
,
and
I
shalldo
so
to
the

<EOS>
It

indeed
,
a

”“well

I

<EOS>
Can

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
”albert
<EOS>
’s
heart
beat
,
tumultuously
at
these

,
and
his
first
thoughtwas,—“Will

his
agitation

”Learmont

lean
back
in

“when

”“Indeed

Manwho

Hung
on
Monday

<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
be
so
horrified
at
the
awful
sight
that
meet
his
eye
,
uponopene
the
cupboard
in
the
old
attic
,
that
for
some
moment
he
couldneither
think
,
move
,
nor
speak
;
and
it
be
only
the
strong
presentdread
of
some
one
come
upon
him
suddenly
from
the
low
part
of
thehouse
and
take
his
life
,
upon
find
he
be
aware
of
the
murderedman
be
in
the
cupboard
<EOS>
,
that
arouse
him
from
the
absolute
lethargyof
<EOS>
fear
he
be
rapidly
fall
into
.
<EOS>
the
body
lie
on
its
face
at
his
foot
,
and
it
appear
to
have
beenproppe
up
in
the
cupboard
,
merely
by
the
shutting
of
the
door
quickly
,
so
that
it
have
fall
out
the
moment
Gray
have
,
by
open
the
door
,
remove
the
support
.
<EOS>
He
feel
that
there
be
no
chance
for
him
but
put
the
loathsomeobject
back
again
into
its
receptacle
,
and
our
reader
may
imagine
whata
terrible
job
it
be
to
such
a
man
as
Jacob
Gray
to
raise
that
hideousmass
of
death
,
and
replace
it
in
the
cupboard
.
<EOS>
He
stoop
and
lay
histremble
hand
upon
the
neck
.
<EOS>
He
drag
it
up
—
the
head
hang
about
inthat
strange
loose
manner
which
indicate
a
certain
stage
in
theprogress
of
decomposition
.
<EOS>
Gray
shudder
,
and
bungle
much
over
what
he
have
to
do
,
because
hisobject
be
to
get
the
dead
body
into
the
cupboard
without
look
atthe
face
;
and
he
,
therefore
,
sedulously
turn
his
head
away
.
<EOS>
the
weight
be
very
great
,
and
after
many
fruitless
effort
,
gray
foundit
impossible
to
get
the
body
fix
for
one
instant
,
so
as
to
allow
himto
close
the
door
.
<EOS>
once
he
catch
one
of
the
ghastly
band
between
thedoor
and
the
side
-
post
.
<EOS>
then
,
by
not
be
quick
enough
,
the
bodyleane
forward
,
and
he
catch
the
hideous
distorted
face
in
the
sameway
.
<EOS>
a
cry
of
horror
burst
from
his
lip
,
as
his
eye
inadvertently
fellupon
the
horrible
visage
,
and
now
that
he
have
once
look
he
could
notturn
his
eye
away
,
have
he
be
offer
a
world
for
the
effort
.
<EOS>
“horrible
!
<EOS>
horrible
!
"
<EOS>
he
moan
,
and
then
let
go
the
door
,
the
bodyfell
as
at
first
,
with
a
heavy
lump
upon
its
face
,
at
his
foot
.
<EOS>
“I
shall
be
murder
here
,
"
think
Gray
,
"
and
must
leave
at
allhazard
.
<EOS>
I
—
I
have
well
risk
be
again
see
,
and
hoot
by
the
mob
,
than
remain
here
to
certain
death
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
approach
the
window
as
he
speak
;
but
to
his
horror
,
he
find
bythe
shout
that
at
once
greet
him
,
that
his
tormentor
be
stillthere
.
<EOS>
“What
can
save
me
now

"
<EOS>
he
groan
,
"
I

”He
<EOS>
sink
upon
the
miserable
chair
that
be
in
the
room
,
and
groanedaloud
in
the
bitterness
of
his
despair
.
<EOS>
then
he
begin
to
wonder
that
no
one
come
to
the
attic
,
and
from
that
hethought
it
just
possible
there
may
be
nobody
in
the
house
,
and
thathis
own
fear
have
convert
some
casual
noise
into
the
sound
offootstep
on
the
stair
.
<EOS>
there
be
hope
in
this
conjecture

and
he
creep
cautiously
to

attentively

“I

there
may
be

and
possibly
Imight
not

so

dangerous

<EOS>
”It
<EOS>
be
some
minute
more
before
he
could
make
up
his

and
when
,
at

,
he
do

he
go
step

withsuch
extreme
slowness

caution
,
that
it
be

<EOS>
the

a
frightful
gush

by
the
time

below

he
be
in
a
state
of
terror
andnervousness
that
would
have

<EOS>
He
sit
down
upon
the
bottom

and
as
far
as
he
be

commandthem

he
bend
all
his

<EOS>
one
door
be
ajar

and
he
now
feel
satisfied
there
be
no

there
,
but
another
door
be
close
shut
,
and
it
be
with
the
greatestdifficulty
that
he
could
command
his
nerve
to
crawl
past
it

<EOS>
His
footnow
be
upon

from

”Then

Jacob

be
so
apt

suppose
Albert

tobe
set

<EOS>
upon
this
argument

he
decide
upon
inform

that
the

may
knock
foradmittance

with
a
nervous
hand

the
old
massive

speedily

inanswer

<EOS>
He

the
deep
sepulchral
tone
ofLearmont

unpropitious
aspect

all
bent

be
for

make
up
his

whenever

;
sometimes
two

consecutively

and
sometimesearly
in

and
sometimes
very
late

so
that

as

in

an

this
may

that
be
,
that
the

begin

jumpedinto

with

when

his
view
,
with
regard
to
the
young
man

be
to
tracehim
to
his
house
,
and
then
immediately
after
send
for
him
to
his
,
SirFrancis
’s
office
,
by
Buckingham
-
house
;
and
,
in
a
conversation
with
him
,
endeavour
to
come
to
a
more
decided
opinion
than
he
be
at
present
ableto
<EOS>
arrive
at
with
respect
to
the
stability
of
his
affection
for
ada;for
<EOS>
it
be
not
say
too
much
,
when
we
assert
that
the
interest
feel
bythe
magistrate
in
the
welfare
and
future
happiness
of
the
beautifulgirl
,
who
be
,
by
<EOS>
so
singular
a
train
of
circumstance
,
place
in
hiscare
,
be
equal
to
that
of
a
fond
father
for
a
darle
child
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
the
very
romantic
circumstance
connect
with
her
would
have
investedAda
with
a
great
interest
,
even
have
she
be
other
than
what
she
was;but
<EOS>
when
in
herself
,
she
concentrate
all
the
sweet
feminine
charm
ofmind
and
person
which
the
warm
fancy
could
suggest
,
she
become
,
indeed
,
an
object
of
deep
interest
to
Sir
Francis
—
an
interest
whichamounte
to
a
pure
and
holy
affection
.
<EOS>
Her
gentleness
,
and
yet
her
rare
courage
—
her
simplicity
,
and
yet
heractive
intellect
—
her
cling
affection
and
gush
gratitude
to
thosewho
be
kindly
disposed
towards
her
,
and
her
utter
want
ofselfishness
,
<EOS>
all
combine
to
make
her
such
a
character
as
one
mightdream
of
,
but
seldom
hope
to
see
realise
.
<EOS>
“her
future
happiness
,
"
think
Sir
Francis
,
"
all
depend
upon
thisyoung
man
whom
I
be
now
follow
,
and
I
think
I
have
a
right
to
bemore
careful
that
Ada
,
with
all
her
fine
noble
feeling
,
be
notsacrifice
to
one
who
may
fail
to
appreciate
the
rich
treasure
he
maypossess

<EOS>
I
will
,
ere
I
welcome
this
Albert

wellassure
that
he

of
the
pure
young
heart
that
I
amconvince
be
all
his
own
.
<EOS>
one
pang
be
far
well
for
Ada
to
endure
thanthe
year
of
misery
that
must
ensue
from
an
ill
-
assorted
union

<EOS>
”reasone
<EOS>
thus
the
magistrate
follow
Albert
Seyton
sufficiently
closeto
<EOS>
be
certain
he
could
enter
no
house
without
his
observation
;
and
yetat
the
same
time
,
at
such
a
distance
as
to
run
no
great
risk
ofrecognition
should
the
young
man
turn
round
.
<EOS>
little
do
poor
Albert
,
whose
mind
be
,
at
the
present
moment
,
<EOS>
so
fullof
recollection
of
his
Ada
,
that
he
scarcely
know
whither
hisfootstep
lead
him
,
imagine
that
he
have
not
only
pass
her
withintwenty
pace
,
but
be
now
actually
keep
from
her
because
there
be
adoubt
of
the
sincerity
of
that
passion
which
be
at
once
the
bliss
andthe
bane
of
his
existence
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
could
not
hear
the
deep
sigh
that
burst
from
the
labouringheart
of
the
young
man
,
as
he
whisper
to
himself—“My

”The

<EOS>
the
private

if

he

He
must

the
fact
speak
plainly

a
confidentialservant
of

can
only
be
one
degree
remove
from

that

be
one
deep

be
itpossible
that
this

sometimes
he

himself
in

toss

while

<EOS>
ravenous

o’er

he
would
lie
upon

<EOS>
for
hundred

mile
there
would
be
nothing

—
sand
hot
and
scorch
to
the
touch
as

ash
of

glowingfurnace
—
then
a
fearful
drought
come
over
him
,
and
he
shriek
forwater

and
think
what
a
heaven
it
would
be
to
be
once
more
dashedmadly
to

by

—
then
a

he
hear

—
he
see
the

with
bronze
complexion

come
slowly
on

he
see
that
they
have
water

deep
draught
of
the
delicious

<EOS>
one
then
ask
him
ifhe

then
he
could
not
speak

His

seemedglue
to
the

,
one
by

they
ask

he
shriek
for

for

one
drop
toquench
for

the

fever
of
his
throat

<EOS>
the
dream
be
horrible
,
but
the
vision
that
follow
be
more
terrible
,
because
the
suffering
be
mental
as
well

horribly

and
amid

Learmont
could
recognise
the
feature
of
those
whom
he
have
drive
todeath

<EOS>
slowly
they
come
after
him
,
and
a
voice
seem
to
ring
in

Confidence

Heart
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
be
never
so
much
vexed
in
his
life
as
he
be
atthe
suppose
treachery
of
Albert
Seyton
.
<EOS>
He
revolve
in
his
mind
overand
over
again
,
how
he
should
tell
Ada
of
the
scene
that
have
occurredbetween
him
and
her
lover
,
and
of
all
his
suspicion
concern
him
,
and
at
length
he
resolve
that
Lady
Hartleton
should
be
the
medium
ofcommunicate
<EOS>
the
unwelcome
intelligence
of
Albert
’s
defection
from
hislove
and
entertainment
by
Ada
’s
bad
enemy
.
<EOS>
for
this
purpose
it
become
necessary
that
Ada
should
be
put
inpossession
of
more
fact
concern
herself
than
the
humane
andconsiderate
magistrate
<EOS>
have
,
as
yet
,
think
proper
to
burthen
her
mindwith
.
<EOS>
this
he
much
regret
,
because
he
have
hope
that
before
he
hadoccasion
to
mention
Learmont
<EOS>
’s
name
particularly
to
Ada
,
he
should
beable
to
couple
with
it
something
more
than
mere
surmise
<EOS>
,
however
wellfounde
such
surmise
may
be
.
<EOS>
while
he
be
in
his
own
private
room
,
consider
deeply
and
painfullythis
matter
,
a
note
arrive
to
him
,
which
be
immediately
anothersource
of
vexation
,
inasmuch
as
it
hurry
on
the
event
which
he
wouldhave
<EOS>
be
glad
to
see
develop
themselves
a
little
further
before
heactively
interfere
in
them
.
<EOS>
the
letter
be
from
the
Secretary
of
State
,
intimate
that
the
chargesconfidentially
make
against
Learmont
,
by
him
,
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
must
either
be
abandon
,
or
speedily
prove
,
for
that
a
dissolution
ofparliament
be
about
to
take
place
,
and
it
be
absolutely
necessary
toknow
in
whose
hand
the
Learmont
property
be
.
<EOS>
“This
,
"
say
Sir
Francis
,
as
he
lay
down
the

mustbre
affair
to

<EOS>
I
must
apprehend
Jacob
Gray
now
,
andBritton
,
and
trust
to
one
or
other
of
them
commit
Learmont
;
aslender
,
hope
,
I
be
afraid
,
since
no
mercy
can
be
offer
to
Gray
onaccount
of
Vaughan
’s
business
,
and
Britton
be
the
last
person
to
expecta
confession
from
.
<EOS>
”Sir
<EOS>
Francis
then
take
from
a
secret
drawer
the
small
scrap
of
paperwhich
he
procure
from
mad
Maud
,

read
them
again
attentively
.
<EOS>
“These
be
interesting
to
me
,
"
he
say
,
"
as
lead
me
on
in
my
chainof
conjecture

but
they
be
no
evidence
,
for
,
first
of
all
,
who
be
toprove
they
be
ever
write
by
Jacob
Gray
,
or
in
his
possession
;
andsecondly
,
they
be
too
vague
in
themselves
to
be
of
any
importance
,
unless
merely
use
as
evidence
corroborative
of
fact
which
can
benearly
prove
without
them

<EOS>
the
question
now
be
,
have
Gray
write
afull
disclosure
of
who
Ada
<EOS>
be
,
and
what
crime
have
lead
to
her
beingplace
in
so
singular
a
position
,
or
not
?
<EOS>
well
,
I
will
crave
of

another
week
;
and
then
consent
to
withdraw
my
charge
againstlearmont
for
the
present
.

He
must
triumph
,
I
suppose
,

I
can
not
helpit

<EOS>

seek

Assignation.—Britton
’s
Surprise
and
Exaltation

<EOS>
Learmont
stand
for
some
few
moment
gaze
on
the
bloated
swarthycountenance
of
the
smith
,
without
make
an
effort
to
awaken
him
fromhis
slumber
.
<EOS>
dark
thought
chase
each
other
through
the
mind
of
thesquire
,
and
he
say
,
through
his
clenched
teeth,—“sot!—villain!—but
that
you
be
useful
to
me
still
<EOS>
,
I
would
strangleyou
as
there
you
lie
in
your
drunken
sleep
!
<EOS>
if
Jacob
Gray
be
dead
,
this
moment
should
be
your
last
,
Andrew
Britton
!
<EOS>
but
I
have
use
foryou
,
and
the
opportunity
which
now
occur
,
may
never
occur
again
.
<EOS>
StillI
may
do
something
even
now
;
I
may
search
to
see
if
I
can
find
anypaper
or
document
in
this
room
.
<EOS>
He
may
,
notwithstanding
my
suspicionsto
the
contrary
,
have
leave
behind
him
some
record
of
the
crime
he
hasbeen
engage
<EOS>
in!”Learmont
walk
carefully
about
the
room
,
and
peer
into
everyprobable
place
,
in
the
expectation
of
be
repay
by
some
discovery
ofimportance
to
his
interest
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
not
a
scrap
of
write
inthe
chamber
that
he
could
discover
.
<EOS>
“Where
<EOS>
can
he
have
put
the
paper
he
always
boast
of
have
foundupon
the
body
of
him
who
meet
his
death
on
that
eventful
night
,
at
theold
Smithy
?
<EOS>
He
say
there
be
a
pocket
-
book
,
in
which
be
familydocument
touch
me
very
nearly
;
and
Jacob
Gray
,
of
his
ownknowledge
,
confirm
the
tale
,
regret
the
while
that
his
own
fearswould
not
allow
him
to
rob
the
dead
of
those
important
paper
.
<EOS>
IfBritton
have
them
,
they
must
be
here
somewhere
.
<EOS>
”Eagerly
again
do
Learmont
examine
the
room
,
but
there
be
nothing
tobe
find
of
the
character
he
wish
,
and
he
be
fain
,
at
length
,
togive
up
the
search
in
despair
.
<EOS>
then
he
half
-
draw
his
sword
and
think
he
would
kill
Britton
,
but
asecond
thought
tell
how
much
safe
he
may
do
so
on
some
of
his
visitsto
his
own
house
,
and
he
sheathe
his
sword
again
,
muttering,—“The
time
will
come
—
the
time
will
come
.
<EOS>
I
will
first
use
him
,
and
thenhe
shall
die
.
<EOS>
now
to
awaken
this
slumber
clod
.
”He
<EOS>
seize
Britton
by
the
collar
,
and
shake
him
very
roughly
,
crying,—“Britton
—
<EOS>
Andrew
Britton
,
awake!”“you

"
<EOS>
mutter
Britton

Learmont
in

ear
.
<EOS>
“Con

"
growl
Britton
.
<EOS>
"
curse
everybody!”learmont
now
shake
him
so
violently
that
he
open
his
dull
heavy
eyesand
fix
them
on
the
squire
’s
face
,
with
a
stare
of
such
astonishment
,
that
it
be
doubtful
to
Learmont
if
he
be
in
his
sense
or
not
.
<EOS>
“Do
<EOS>
you
know
me

Andrew

<EOS>
he

.
<EOS>
“I

It

He
say
that

that

Jacob

”“Now

“You

not

dreary

immure

expression
ofdeep
dejection

be
remark

it
as
a

guilt

no

<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
’s
first
step
after
see
Ada
enter
the
room
inwhich
<EOS>
Albert
be
,
be
to
communicate
to
his
wife
all
that
have
pass
,
and
commission
her
to
explain
all
to
Albert
,
if
such
explanation
shouldbe
seek
for
before
his
return
,
for
he
feel
it
necessary
,
inconsequence
of
the
extraordinary
event
which
have
transpire
,
tocommunicate
to
his
impatient
friend
,
the
home
secretary
,
before
eventake
step
to
apprehend
Britton
and
Learmont
for
the
murder
of
Gray
,
which
upon
Albert
<EOS>
’s
testimony
he
feel
be
what
may
be
safely
venturedupon
.
<EOS>
the
magistrate
accordingly
leave
his
house
,
and
proceed
on
foot
to
thesecretary
’s
office
,
where
he
be
fortunate
enough
to
find
the
great
mandisengaged
.
<EOS>
“I
have
come
,
"
say
Hartleton
,
"
to
state
to
your
lordship
some
strangecircumstance
with
relation
to
the
person
name
Learmont
,
concerningwhom
<EOS>
I
have
before
have
the
honour
of
converse
with
you
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
secretary
put
on
a
face
of
alarm
as
he
replied—“really
?
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
,
you
must
drop
this
matter
<EOS>
—
his
majesty
have
onlythis
day
in
council
determine
upon
a
dissolution
of
the
presentparliament
—
of
course
I
tell
you
in
confidence
—
and
this
Learmont
’s
votesin
the
Commons
may
be
of
the
great
consequence
.
<EOS>
”“But
,
my
lord
,
"
say
Hartleton
,
"
there
be
good
reason
to
believe
thatno
later
than
last
night
he
commit
a
most
awful
murder
.
<EOS>
”“dear
<EOS>
me
,
"
say
the
secretary
,
"
he
may
as
well
have
wait
till
thegeneral
election
be
over
.
<EOS>
It
be
really
such
a
very
awkward
thing
<EOS>
tohang
a
man
who
can
command
several
vote
in
the
Commons
.
<EOS>
”“It
<EOS>
may
be
so
,
"
say
Sir
Francis
,
with
a
smile
,
"
but
when
people
whocommand
vote
will
commit
murder
,
what
be
to
be
done?”“Ah
that
’
very
true
;
but
uncommonly
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
think
it
my
duty
,
"
continue
Hartleton
,
"
to
let
your
lordship
knowbefore
<EOS>
I
arrest
him
.
”“bless
<EOS>
my
heart
,
"
say
the
secretary
,
"
now
I
recollect
there
have
be
arecord
here
to
-
day
contain
an
invitation
to
a
mask
ball
which
thisvery
man
be
go
to
give
on
Friday
.
”“Indeed
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
.
<EOS>
I
send
a
civil
acceptance
of
the
invitation
of
course
,
because
Imeant
to
sound
him
in
the
course
of
the
evening
about
his
vote
.
<EOS>
nowreally
,
Sir
Francis
,
you
must
let
the
ball
be
over
before
you
come
inwith
your
charge
of
murder
,
and
so
on
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
will
if
your
lordship
please
;
but
the
property
of
Learmont
,
provide
he
be
convict
of
murder
,
will
revert
to
the
Crown
,
in
whichevent
you
will
have
his
vote
.
”“ah
,
but
,
my
dear
Sir
Francis
,
the
Crown
,
in
common
decency
,
must
waiveits
right
to
the
property
in
favour
of
the
next
of
kin
.
<EOS>
”“I
believe
there
can
arise
no
claimant
,
"
say
Sir
Francis
;
"
thereforethere
can
be
no
delicacy
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
”“Well
<EOS>
that
’
lucky
—
but
you
will
let
the
ball
be
over
.
<EOS>
I
be
tell
it
’
tobe
a
splendid
affair
,
and
really
so
many
of
our
political
friendsintend
to
make
it
a
complete
rendezvous
,
that
it
would
be
a
thousandpitie
not
to
let
it
go
off
with
some
éclat
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
shall
,
of
course
,
not
interfere
,
my
lord
;
but
should
anything
occurto
force
a
magisterial
duty
,
I
trust
your
lordship
will
not
expect
meto
shrink
from

mine

<EOS>
”“well
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
not

but
do
not

,
Sir
Francis
,
if
you
canpossibly
avoid
it

by

the

ask
who

<EOS>
It

nobody
of
any
consequence

I
presume?”“he
certainly
have
no

<EOS>
”“no
<EOS>
vote?”“No
,
nor
be
likely
ever
to
have
one
.
”“indeed
.
<EOS>
well
,
I
do
hate
people
who
have
no
vote
most
cordially
,
and
Ishould
say
there
can
be
only
one
class
of
people
more
abominable
,
andthat
be
the
class
which
vote
against
one
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
at
all
<EOS>
see
the
usein
this
world
of
people
without
vote
.
<EOS>
how
uncommonly
silly
Learmontmust
have
be
,
really
.
”“silly
<EOS>
enough
,
my
lord
,
to
put
his
neck
in
jeopardy
,
for
a
jury
willmost
naturally
bring
him
in
guilty
,
and
the
king
can
not
very
well
sparea
murderer
.
<EOS>
”“Why
no
,
not
exactly
<EOS>
;
but
at
all
event
do
not
say
a
word
about
it
tillafter
the
ball

”“unless
<EOS>
there
should
arise
an
absolute
necessity
I
will
not

”“oh
,
well
,
I
must
speak
to
the
coroner
about
it
,
and
the
inquest
mustjust
be
put
off
till
Saturday
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
I
do
not
see
the
use
of
aninqu
upon
a
man
who
have
no

,
Sir
Francis

but
I
suppose
thesething
must
be
do
to
please
the
common
people

<EOS>
”“they
must
indeed

Sir

any
tamper
with

consider
their

ever

a

task
for

<EOS>
”“ah
<EOS>
,
well
,
we
must
do
the
good
we
can
,
but
you
know
it
would
have
beenmuch
well
if
this
Learmont
,
while
he
be
murder
,
have
murder
someone
with
a

It
may
have
make
a

you
see

Sir

<EOS>
”“so
<EOS>
it
may
,
your
lordship
;
but
when
people
murder
,
I
be
afraid
theythink
more
of
their
own
private
quarrel
than
of
vote

<EOS>
”“ah

no

You
be
quite
right

good

<EOS>
”“good
<EOS>
morning
,
your
lordship

<EOS>
”Sir
<EOS>
Francis
Hartleton
could
not
help
laugh
as
he
walk
homeward
atthe
curious
morality
of
the
secretary
,
who
measure
everybody’simportance
by
their
number
of
vote
,
and
he
think
to
himself
surelythis
system
of
representation
will
be
some
day
do
away
with
,
andEnglishmen
will
be
permit
to
exercise
their
franchise
and
theirconscience
freely

<EOS>
absorb
then
in
meditation
concern
the
importantsteps
which
require
to
be
take
previous
to
the
Friday
evening
,
beyondwhich
time
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
be
quite
resolve
Learmont
should
notremain
at
liberty
,
he
saunter
home
from
the
minister’s
.
<EOS>
believe
,
as
the
magistrate
now
do
,
since
Jacob
Gray
be
dead

and
nowritten
paper
could
be
find
about
his

in

to

a
warrant

onthe

a

which
upon
the
testimony
ofalbert
could
be
bring
as
nearly
home
to
him
as
strong
circumstantialevidence
could
bring
it
.
<EOS>
“It
may
be
then
,
"
thought
Sir
Francis
,
"
that
when
he
see
his
mortalcareer
closing
,
he
will
do
one
act
of
grace
,
and
declare
who
and
whatAda
be

detail
his
reason
for
persecute
her
so
strangely

fortake
the

of

now
seem
to

chance

I
have
already
receive
some
of
the

surely
I
be
innocent

It

as
I
gaze
upon
its

by
theoccasional
flash

all
strength
seem
to
desert
me
,
and
Ifelt
I
have
not

think
I
should
have
sunkinto

a
fearful
timidity

terror
bedew
my

totenfold
fury
;
and
while
the

be
be
set
fire
to
by
Learmont

the

I
see
by
the
dull
red
glare
that
begin
to
spread
itselfaround
,
and
light
up
every
thing
with
its
ghastly
lustre
—
I
see
mymaster
stagger
back

from

sudden
blow

He
call
too
on
me
to
help
him

but
I
could
not

<EOS>
I
see
another

give

I
hear
the
sickening
crush

as
the

sink
into

then
he
fall

with
oneshriek

scare
me
from

horror
from

the

Ishould
next
do

<EOS>
return
to

I
dare
not

for
I
dread
thevengeance
of

,
not
only
on
account
of
my
failing
in
what
Ihad
to

I
could

dispossess
myself
of
the

<EOS>
It
be
the
fourth
evening
after
my
arrival
in
London
that
a
woman
,
whowa
sit
upon
a
step
,
with
a
child
in
her
lap
,
implore
my
charity
.
<EOS>
I
refuse
her
,
and
be
about
to
pass
on
,
when
a
glance
tell
me
that
thechild
with
her
be
the
young
Ada
Madelini
,
the
child
of
Mr.
Learmont
;
Ipaused
,
and
question
her
.
<EOS>
She
tell
me
her
name
be
Tattan
,
and
saidshe
have
flee
from
the
country
with
the
child
,
to
save
its
life
,
whichhad
be
threaten
by
a
man
,
wicked
and
powerful
.
<EOS>
all
this
confirmedme
—
I
snatch
the
child
from
her
arm
,
for
I
think
it
an
admirablepossession
,
since
it
would
give
me
the
mean
of
make
my
own
term
,
atsome
future
time
,
with
the
Squire
of
Learmont
.
<EOS>
the
woman
scream
and
run
after
me
,
cry
for
help
.
<EOS>
no
one
be
nearus
,
and
with
one
blow
I
silence
her
,
and
she
fall
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Whatbecame
of
her
I
never
know
,
but
I
take
the
child
home
with
me
,
and
thenext
day
I
change
my
lodging
,
pass
the
infant
as
my
own
.
<EOS>
from
house
to
house
I
shift
my
residence
,
always
think
myselfsuspecte
by
some
one
,
until
I
go
to
reside
at
a
low
house
,
keep
by
awoman
,
by
name
Strangeways
,
who
reside
in
the
neighbourhood
ofswallow
-
street
.
<EOS>
before
go
there
,
however
,
I
buy
boy
’s
<EOS>
clothingfor
the
girl
,
as
I
think
it
safe
to
make
her
appear
as
a
boy
thanlet
her
real
sex
be
know
.
<EOS>
nearly
ten
year
have
elapse
,
and
I
wasfalling
fast
into
poverty
,
for
a
concern
in
which
I
have
place
somemoney
,
under
tempting
promise
,
prove
a
failure
.
<EOS>
then
I
bethink
meof
some
mean
of
improve
my
condition
,
and
recruit
my
emptycoffer
.
<EOS>
after
much
thought
,
I
resolve
upon
go
to
the
village
of
Learmont
,
and
form
a
coalition
if
possible
,
with
the
smith
,
Andrew
Britton
,
for
the
purpose
of
extort
money
from
the
rich
squire
.
<EOS>
but
previouslyto
go
I
write
a
paper
,
contain
all
the
particular
here
relate
,
and
seal
it
<EOS>
,
I
leave
it
with
Ada
,
who
I
have
name
,
in
conformity
withher
male
attire
,
Harry
,
charge
her
to
let
it
reach
the
hand
ofyourself
in
the
event
of
my
not
return
by
a
stipulate
time
.
<EOS>
I
wenton
my
errand
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
winter
,
and
the
snow
lie
thickly
in
thevalley
of
Learmont
;
as
I
reach
the
village
<EOS>
inn
<EOS>
I
inquire
if
thesmith
,
Britton
,
be
still
alive
;
I
be
tell
he
be
,
and
hear
then
theclank
of
his
forge
-
hammer
,
the
same
most
probably
that
have
take
thelife
of
Mr.
Learmont
.
<EOS>
I
seek
him
,
and
suffice
to
say
,
that
I
not
onlyconvince
him
of
the
inexpediency
of
attempt
aught
against
my
life
,
which
,
as
I
guess
he
would
be
,
he
be
much
inclined
to
do
,
butsucceede
in
induce
him
to
join
with
me
in
extort
large
sum
fromthe
guilty
squire
.
<EOS>
Britton
,
too
,
I
persuade
to
search
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
,
when
,
as
I
tell
him
,
he
find
paper
of
great
consequence
to
thesquire
—
paper
which
he
would
gladly
have
redeem
at
any
price
,
butwhich
be
of
infinitely
more
value
as
a
source
of
permanent
income
totheir
fortunate
holder
.
<EOS>
I
have
lend
the
smith
a
knife
of
mine
at
his
own
request
before
themurder
,
and
when
I
visit
him
he
produce
it
,
<EOS>
stain
with
human
gore
,
taunt
me
with
the
fact
that
my
name
be
on
the
handle
,
and
that
itwould
ever
prove
a
damn
evidence
of
my
guilt
.
<EOS>
’Twas
be
we
three
man
in
each
other
’s
power
.
<EOS>
either
Britton
or
myselfcould
bring
the
whole
three
to
destruction
,
and
the
squire
be
but
tooglad
to
ensure
his
own
safety
by
pay
large
sum
to
us
from
time
totime

<EOS>
He
come

My

who
he
believe
to
be
legitimate
,
and
likewise

.
<EOS>
I
repeat

I
may
be
dead

absent
from
England
,
when
you
arrive

butbe
it
which
way
<EOS>
it
may

if
you
want
proof
of

I
assert

at
Learmont

and
you
may
still

some
tracesof

of

<EOS>
Apprehend
Andrew

and
search
for

I
mention

as
well
as
for
any

have
take

<EOS>
among

,
beg
his
brother
to
meet
him
at
the
Old
Smithy
,
instead
of
come
direct
to
his
own
mansion
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
understand
by
you
,
then
,
clearly
,
that
I
accuse
these
twoman
,
Squire
Learmont
and
Andrew
Britton
,
of
the
murder
of
Learmont’selder
brother

and
the
project

CHAPTER
CXII.The
Consultation

Arrangement
for
the
Ball

<EOS>
when
he
have
finish
the
confession
of
Gray
,
Sir
Francis
hartletonlooke
up
and
draw
a
long
breath
.
<EOS>
an
inexpressible
feeling
of
reliefcame
over
him
,
and
he
cried,—“It
be
as
I
partly
expect
.
<EOS>
Ada
be
relate
to
this
squire
nearly
.
<EOS>
withregard
to
her
alleged
illegitimacy
,
I
do
not
believe
it
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
the
malice
of
Jacob
Gray
,
for
denounce
him
in
the
open
street
,
isfully
sufficient
to
account
for
his
making
such
an
assertion
.
<EOS>
that
,
however
,
be
a
fact
which
can
be
very
easily
ascertain
;
and
I
have
nota
shadow
of
doubt
but
my
beautiful
young
friend
,
after
all
her
severetrial
and
persecution
,
will
become
the
possessor
of
the
splendidestate
of
Learmont
,
and
will
be
able
to
reward
the
constancy
of
herlover
with
a
princely
income
.
<EOS>
oh
,
what
a
relief
it
be
,
after
all
,
tofind
that
Jacob
Gray
can
not
claim
the
least
shadow
of
kindre
with
Ada
.
<EOS>
well
,
he
have
go
to
his
account
;
and
,
although
I
have
no
moral
doubtin
the
world
of
the
guilt
of
Britton
and
Learmont
as
regard
<EOS>
ada’sfather
<EOS>
,
yet
this
paper
would
be
very
insufficient
evidence
to
proceedupon
.
<EOS>
if
they
suffer
the
penalty
of
the
law
for
murder
,
it
will
be
forthat
of
Jacob
Gray
himself

in

”while

to
soothe
the
agitated
spirit
of

Sir

Albert
to
the
window

and
said,—“Gray
,
in
his
confession
,
assert
the
illegitimacy
of
Ada
,
but
from
allthat
I
have
ever
hear
of
the
character
of
the
eld
Learmont

as
wellas
from
the
evidently
anxious
manner
in
which
Gray
have
repeatedlystate
the
circumstance

I
much
doubt
its
truth

It
be

necessary

himself

<EOS>
the
family
of
Ada

can
surely
be
easily

I
think
some
one
must
be
instantly
despatch

CHAPTER
CXIII.Learmont
and
Britton
after
the
murder
.
<EOS>
have
devote
so
large
a
space
to
the
hope
,
the
fear
,
the
surprise
,
and
the
joy
of
those
in
whose
happiness
,
and
freedom
from
thedistresse
and
persecution
which
surround
them
,
we
be
so
largelyinterested
,
we
turn
with
a
sensation
of
sickening
gloom
to
the
two
menof
blood
.
<EOS>
Learmont
and
the
savage
smith
,
after
they
have
satedthemselve
with
gore
,
and
like
ferocious
tiger
of
the
jungle
,
cameslinke
from
the
feast
of
blood
which
they
have
seek
with
avidity
,
and
taste
of
so
greedily
.
<EOS>
neither
of
them
speak
after
they
reach
the
street
-
door
of
Gray’shouse
,
until
they
have
place
several
street
between
them
and
the
onein
which
the
awful
deed
be
commit
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
dogged
,
apathetic
kind
of
movement
and
manner
aboutBritton
,
as
with
a
heavy
tread
he
slowly
walk
by
the
side
of
thesquire
,
which
more
resemble
the
gross
serenity
of
some
over
-
gorgedreptile
than
anything
else
.
<EOS>
never
before
have
the
smith
’s
appetite
fordestruction
be
so
thoroughly
sated
—
<EOS>
never
before
have
he
accomplish
adarle
wish
of
his
heart
so
fully
and
so
completely
.
<EOS>
His
hatred
ofjacob
Gray
have
be
one
of
his
chief
passion
for
year
,
and
he
hadalway
please
himself
with
the
notion
of
some
day
have
a
revengewhich
should
be
in
accordance
with
his
savage
nature
,
and
full
ofterror
.
<EOS>
yet
in
his
wildest
dream
—
in
his
most
fanciful
imagining
ofwhat
he
would
like
to
do
to
Jacob
Gray
<EOS>
,
he
have
fall
short
of
thescene
of
horror
and
blood
<EOS>

have
that
night
go
through

<EOS>

AndrewBritton
be
satisfied
—
quite
satisfied
,
as
regard
Jacob
Gray
,
and
hefelt
all
the
ennui
and
satiety
which
be
sure
to
arise
,
when
the
greatobject
which
he
have
always
pleased
himself

should
one
day

awful
death

as

him
to

andwhich
be
only
disagreeable
because
it

and
could
not

<EOS>
now
and
then
he
would
cast
a
scowling
glance
upon
the

strike
him
down
with
the
cleaver
he

hold
in
his

He

the
great
object
of

existence
have
slippedaway
from

the

upon
which
to
fall
backin

<EOS>
“Curses
on
him

"
<EOS>
he
mutter
.
<EOS>
"
He

Britton

him
again
the
pleasure
of

Bond

cleaver

<EOS>
but
what
be
these
thought
of

coarse

minded
,
brutal
animal

in

with
the
whirl

frightful
feeling

up

huge
gout
of

seem
to
intercept

cast
his

downwards

he
could
not
divest
himselfof
the
idea

he
be

in
ensanguined
pool
of
human
gore

<EOS>
Heground
his
tooth
together
till
he
produce
a
resemblance
of
thecrashing
sound
which
the
cleaver
wield
by
Britton
have
make
as
it
camein
contact
with
the
crunched
bone
of

despairingcry

more
conscious

afeele
of
exhaustion
come
over
him
in
consequence
of
the
fatigue
,
both
of
body
and
mind
he
have
undergo
,
he
partially

himselfof
his
apparel

himself
upon

hideous
by

frightful
image
which

up
by

<EOS>
It
be
some
four
hour
or
more
before
he
again
awaken
,
and
then
hefound
himself
much
refresh
both
bodily
and
mentally
.
<EOS>
He
run
over
inhis

accurately
all
the
circumstance

his
present
position

that
his

judgment
have
sway

the
horror
of
the

he
have
pass
through
be
begin
to
subside
<EOS>
,
he
incline
moreand
more
to
his
previously
express
opinion
,
that
Jacob
Gray
have
notreally
write
any
confession
,
but
have
merely
pretend
to
have
such
adocument
always
at
hand
,
for
the
purpose
of
awe
him
and
save
his
,
Jacob

life

from
any
attempt
on
the

either
of
his
greatenemie

and
pace
his

in
deep
thought

as
it
be
upon
a
mine
,
which
,
do
he
but
know
it
,
be
ready
toexplode
beneath
him
,
and
hurl
him
to
destruction
;
a
feel
ofself
-
satisfaction
begin
to
creep
over
him
,
and
he
re
-
assure
himselfinto
a
belief
that
he
must
have
materially
better
his
situation
bythe
destruction
of
Gray
.
<EOS>
“it
must
be
so
,
"
he
mutter

<EOS>
"
there
be
no
confession

,
and
Graywas
not
only
a
heavy
expense
,
but
would
,
no

,
some
day
have
playedsome
serious
trick
in
payment
for
the
attempt
which

to
his

I
meet
the

methought
he
look
strangely
at

he
certainly
do

upon
some
most
shallow

slight
excuse

Could

get
up
the
shadow

gladly

I
will
persevere

across

for
the
firsttime

along
with

a

which

containan
insidious

<EOS>
yes

I
will
poison
him

and
then
send
him
some

never

have
him
so
much
under

have

CXVIII.Conclusion
.
<EOS>
Our
eventful
history
be
nearly
end
,
and
yet
we
would
fain
linger
byAda
and
her
fortune
.
<EOS>
We
would
fain
follow
still
through
the
variousscene
of
life
,
the
child
which
be
bring
from
the
blaze
smithy
—
theenthusiastic
girl
,
who
,
in
the
majesty
and
may
of
innocence
,
defiedjacob
gray,—the
pure
beautiful
being
,
who
in
maturer
year
denouncedhim
as
a
murderer
—
she
who
still
cling
to
her
first
,
her
only
love
,
andwhen
the
dear
friend
that
fate
have
give
her
<EOS>
,
Sir
Francis
Hartletoneven
doubt
,
still
assert
her
confidence
in
his
devotion
,
hisintegrity
,
and
his
love
.
<EOS>
We
would
like
to
follow
her
into
domesticlife
,
to
see
how
the
bud
grace
of
the
girl
reach
the
gloriousmeridian
of
their
charm
,
and
how
then
they
mellow
into
a
gracefulautumn
,
but
already
we
have
be
seduce
beyond
our
limit
,
by
ourbeautiful
Ada
and
her
strangely
varied
fortune
,
and
we
must
leave
tothose
reader
who
have
go
with
us
heart
and
hand
thus
far
,
to
imaginefor
themselves
much
that
we
would
fain
record
.
<EOS>
something
,
however
wecannot
refrain
from
state
,
and
first
and
foremost
we
may
say
,
thatAda
become
Mrs.
Seyton
just
one
week
after
the
eventful
ball
atLearmont
’s
house
,
and
that
the
Secretary
of
State
come
to
the
marriage
,
and
want
to
give
the
bride
away
;
but
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
claimedthe
privilege
,
and
reconcile
the
minister
to
his
disappointment
byassure
him
that
Ada
mean
to
let
him
have
all
the
parliamentaryinterest
connect
with
her
property
.
<EOS>
the
lady
at
the
period
of
Ada
’s
marriage
wear
immense
state
dress
,
which
"
would
stand
up
of
themselves
,
"
and
Ada
’s
,
still
well
preserve
,
be
consider
a
kind
of
heir
-
loom
in
the
author
’s
family
,
who
,
by
-
the
-
by
,
may
as
well
state
at
first
as
at
last
,
that
he
be
a
linealdescendant
of
the
persecute
girl
,
and
more
proud
of
his
ancestressthan
if
she
have
be
a
throne
queen
.
<EOS>
for
the
satisfaction
of
his
lady
-
reader
,
the
author
beg
to
state
thatAda
’s
wedding
-
dress
be
,
and
be
of
silver
grey
satin
,
on
which
arewrought
rose
in
white
silk
,
with
here
and
there
so
delicate
a
roseatetinge
,
as
to
give
quite
an
air
of
reality
to
the
mimic
floraladornment
.
<EOS>
She
wear
no
ornament
in
her
hair
,
but
a
rare
and
costlylace
robe
,
present
to
her
by
Lady
Hartleton
,
be
confine
to
herforehead
by
a
single
diamond
,
from
whence
it
hang
down
to
the
veryground
.
<EOS>
then
Albert
Seyton
look
extremely
well
in
the
uniform
of
a
captain
inthe
guard
,
to
which
rank
he
have
be
immediately
present
by
theminister
;
of
course
not
on
account
of
his
vote
—
<EOS>
oh
,
no
.
<EOS>
Lady
Hartleton
,
we
find
by
an
old
letter
before
us
,
be
foolish
enough
to
cry
at
themarriage
,
but
Ada
be
quite
obdurate
,
and
would
not
shed
a
tear
,
sayingin
<EOS>
her
quiet
way,—“why
should
I
weep
when
I
be
happy
,
"
and
as
nobody
know
why
,
she
leftthe
church
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
We
dislike
interfere
in
family
affair
,
but
we
must
say
,
that
wewould
have
propose
Ada
’s
first
little
one
to
be
call
Albert
,
as
itwas
a
boy
,
but
she
would
have
it
name
Francis
,
after
the
worthymagistrate
,
who
stand
godfather
to
it
.
<EOS>
the
next
be
a
girl
,
and
thatAlbert
would
have
name
Ada
,
and
after
that
come
—
but
our
reader
mayimagine
all
that
,
when
we
tell
them
that
that
Ada
be
the
happy
motherof
as
happy
a
family
as
ever
live
.

Sir

withall
proper
solemnity

Ada
be
not
informedof
the
circumstance
for
some
year
after
she
have
be
in
full
enjoymentof
the
Learmont
estate
.
<EOS>
It
would
appear
that
Britton
have
never
run
the
risk
of
have
a
writtenconfession
in
London
with
him
,
but
upon
a
careful
search
in
the
smithy
,
a
bag
be
find
,
in
which
be
a
knife
with
the
initial
of
"
J.G.

onthe
handle
,
and
several
letter
,
likewise
odd
paper
,
one
of
which
wasa
certificate
of
the
marriage
of
Ada
’s
mother
at
Rome
;
another
provedclearly
that
Learmont
,
who
have
live
so
badly
,
and
die
so
terribly
,
be
really
illegitimate
,
so
that
his
claim
to
the

be
not
goodunder
any
circumstance
.
<EOS>
those
document
and
paper
Sir

byhim
they
be

as

<EOS>
Dame

<EOS>
She

make
herself
known
to
her

and
need
we

,
that
theremainder

<EOS>
Bond
