<EOS>
Introductory
,
concern
the
pedigree
of
the
Chuzzlewit
family
 
<EOS>
as
no
lady
or
gentleman
,
with
any
claim
to
polite
breeding
,
can
possibly
sympathize
with
the
Chuzzlewit
Family
without
be
first
assure
of
the
extreme
antiquity
of
the
race
,
it
be
a
great
satisfaction
to
know
that
it
undoubtedly
descend
in
a
direct
line
from
Adam
and
Eve
;
and
be
,
in
the
very
early
time
,
closely
connected
with
the
agricultural
interest
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
should
ever
be
urge
by
grudging
and
malicious
person
,
that
a
Chuzzlewit
,
in
any
period
of
the
family
history
,
display
an
overweening
amount
of
family
pride
,
surely
the
weakness
will
be
consider
not
only
pardonable
but
laudable
,
when
the
immense
superiority
of
the
house
to
the
rest
of
mankind
,
in
respect
of
this
its
ancient
origin
,
be
take
into
account
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
remarkable
that
as
there
be
,
in
the
old
family
of
which
we
have
any
record
,
a
murderer
and
a
vagabond
,
so
we
never
fail
to
meet
,
in
the
record
of
all
old
family
,
with
innumerable
repetition
of
the
same
phase
of
character
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
may
be
lay
down
as
a
general
principle
,
that
the
more
extended
the
ancestry
,
the
great
the
amount
of
violence
and
vagabondism
;
for
in
ancient
day
those
two
amusement
,
combine
a
wholesome
excitement
with
a
promising
mean
of
repair
shattered
fortune
,
be
at
once
the
ennoble
pursuit
and
the
healthful
recreation
of
the
Quality
of
this
land
.
   
<EOS>
consequently
,
it
be
a
source
of
inexpressible
comfort
and
happiness
to
find
,
that
in
various
period
of
our
history
,
the
chuzzlewit
be
actively
connect
with
diver
slaughterous
conspiracy
and
bloody
fray
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
further
record
of
them
,
that
be
clothe
from
head
to
heel
in
steel
of
proof
,
they
do
on
many
occasion
lead
their
leather
-
jerkine
soldier
to
the
death
with
invincible
courage
,
and
afterwards
return
home
gracefully
to
their
relation
and
friend
.
   
<EOS>
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
at
least
one
Chuzzlewit
come
over
with
William
the
Conqueror
.
 
<EOS>
It
do
not
appear
that
this
illustrious
ancestor
"
come
over
"
that
monarch
,
to
employ
the
vulgar
phrase
,
at
any
subsequent
period
;
<EOS>
inasmuch
as
the
Family
do
not
seem
to
have
be
ever
greatly
distinguish
by
the
possession
of
landed
estate
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
well
know
that
for
the
bestowal
of
that
kind
of
property
upon
his
favourite
,
the
liberality
and
gratitude
of
the
Norman
be
as
remarkable
as
those
virtue
be
usually
find
to
be
in
great
man
when
they
give
away
what
belong
to
other
people
.
   
<EOS>
perhaps
in
this
place
the
history
may
pause
to
congratulate
itself
upon
the
enormous
amount
of
bravery
,
wisdom
,
eloquence
,
virtue
,
gentle
birth
,
and
true
nobility
,
that
appear
to
have
come
into
England
with
the
Norman
Invasion
:
an
amount
which
the
genealogy
of
every
ancient
family
lend
its
aid
to
swell
,
and
which
would
beyond
all
question
have
be
find
to
be
just
as
great
,
and
to
the
full
as
prolific
in
give
birth
to
long
line
of
chivalrous
descendant
,
boastful
of
their
origin
,
even
though
William
the
Conqueror
have
be
William
the
Conquered
;
a
change
of
circumstance
which
,
it
be
quite
certain
,
would
have
make
no
manner
of
difference
in
this
respect
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
unquestionably
a
Chuzzlewit
in
the
Gunpowder
Plot
,
if
indeed
the
arch
-
traitor
,
Fawkes
himself
,
be
not
a
scion
of
this
remarkable
stock
;
as
he
may
easily
have
be
,
suppose
another
Chuzzlewit
to
have
emigrate
to
Spain
in
the
previous
generation
,
and
there
intermarried
with
a
spanish
lady
,
by
whom
he
have
issue
,
one
olive
-
complexion
son
.
 
<EOS>
this
probable
conjecture
be
strengthen
,
if
not
absolutely
confirm
,
by
a
fact
which
can
not
fail
to
be
interesting
to
those
who
be
curious
in
trace
the
progress
of
hereditary
taste
through
the
life
of
their
unconscious
inheritor
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
notable
circumstance
<EOS>
that
in
these
later
time
,
many
chuzzlewit
,
be
unsuccessful
in
other
pursuit
,
have
,
without
the
small
rational
hope
of
enrich
themselves
,
or
any
conceivable
reason
,
set
up
as
coal
-
merchant
;
and
have
,
month
after
month
,
continue
gloomily
to
watch
a
small
stock
of
coal
,
without
in
any
one
instance
negotiate
with
a
purchaser
.
 
<EOS>
the
remarkable
similarity
between
this
course
of
proceeding
and
that
adopt
by
their
great
ancestor
beneath
the
vault
of
the
Parliament
House
at
Westminster
,
be
too
obvious
and
too
full
of
interest
,
to
stand
in
need
of
comment
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
also
clearly
prove
by
the
oral
tradition
of
the
Family
,
that
there
exist
,
at
some
one
period
of
its
history
which
be
not
distinctly
state
,
a
matron
of
such
destructive
principle
,
and
so
familiarized
to
the
use
and
composition
of
inflammatory
and
combustible
engine
,
that
she
be
call
"
the
Match
maker
;
"
by
which
nickname
and
byword
she
be
recognize
in
the
Family
legend
to
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
surely
there
can
be
no
reasonable
doubt
that
this
be
the
spanish
lady
,
the
mother
of
Chuzzlewit
Fawkes
.
   
<EOS>
but
there
be
one
other
piece
of
evidence
,
bear
immediate
reference
to
their
close
connection
with
this
memorable
event
in
English
History
,
which
must
carry
conviction
,
even
to
a
mind
(
if
such
a
mind
there
be
)
remain
unconvinced
by
these
presumptive
proof
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
,
within
a
few
year
,
in
the
possession
of
a
highly
respectable
and
in
every
way
credible
and
unimpeachable
member
of
the
Chuzzlewit
Family
(
for
his
bitter
enemy
never
dare
to
hint
at
his
be
otherwise
than
a
wealthy
man
)
,
a
dark
lantern
of
undoubted
antiquity
;
render
still
more
interesting
by
be
,
in
shape
and
pattern
,
extremely
like
such
as
be
in
use
at
the
present
day
.
 
<EOS>
now
this
gentleman
,
since
deceased
,
be
at
all
time
ready
to
make
oath
,
and
do
again
and
again
set
forth
upon
his
solemn
asseveration
,
that
he
have
frequently
hear
his
grandmother
say
,
when
contemplate
this
venerable
relic
,
"
<EOS>
aye
,
aye
!
 
<EOS>
this
be
carry
by
my
fourth
son
on
the
fifth
of
November
,
when
he
be
a
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
these
remarkable
word
work
(
as
well
they
may
)
a
strong
impression
on
his
mind
,
and
he
be
in
the
habit
of
repeat
them
very
often
.
 
<EOS>
the
just
interpretation
which
they
bear
,
and
the
conclusion
to
which
they
lead
,
be
triumphant
and
irresistible
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
lady
,
naturally
strong
-
minded
,
be
nevertheless
frail
and
fade
;
she
be
notoriously
subject
to
that
confusion
of
idea
,
or
,
to
say
the
least
,
of
speech
,
to
which
age
and
garrulity
be
liable
.
<EOS>
the
slight
,
the
very
slight
,
confusion
apparent
in
these
expression
be
manif
,
and
be
ludicrously
easy
of
correction
.
 
<EOS>
"
aye
,
aye
,
"
quoth
she
,
and
it
will
be
observe
that
no
emendation
whatever
be
necessary
to
be
make
in
these
two
initiative
remark
,
"
aye
,
aye
!
<EOS>
this
lantern
be
carry
by
my
forefather
"
---
not
fourth
son
,
which
be
preposterous
---
"
on
the
fifth
of
November
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
be
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
here
we
have
a
remark
at
once
consistent
,
clear
,
natural
,
and
in
strict
accordance
with
the
character
of
the
speaker
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
the
anecdote
be
so
plainly
susceptible
of
this
meaning
and
no
other
,
that
it
would
be
hardly
worth
record
in
its
original
state
,
be
it
not
a
proof
of
what
may
be
(
and
very
often
be
)
affect
not
only
in
historical
prose
but
in
imaginative
poetry
,
by
the
exercise
of
a
little
ingenious
labour
on
the
part
of
a
commentator
.
   
<EOS>
It
have
be
say
that
there
be
no
instance
,
in
modern
time
,
of
a
Chuzzlewit
have
be
find
on
term
of
intimacy
with
the
great
.
<EOS>
but
here
again
the
sneer
detractor
who
weave
such
miserable
figment
from
their
malicious
brain
,
be
stricken
dumb
by
evidence
.
<EOS>
for
letter
be
yet
in
the
possession
of
various
branch
of
the
family
,
from
which
it
distinctly
appear
,
be
state
in
so
many
word
,
that
one
Diggory
Chuzzlewit
be
in
the
habit
of
perpetually
dine
with
Duke
Humphrey
.
 
<EOS>
so
constantly
be
he
a
guest
at
that
nobleman
's
table
,
indeed
;
and
so
unceasingly
be
His
grace
's
hospitality
and
companionship
force
,
as
it
be
,
upon
him
;
that
we
find
him
uneasy
,
and
full
of
constraint
and
reluctance
;
write
his
friend
to
the
effect
that
if
they
fail
to
do
so
and
so
by
bearer
,
he
will
have
no
choice
but
to
dine
again
with
Duke
Humphrey
;
and
express
himself
in
a
very
marked
and
extraordinary
manner
as
one
surfeit
of
High
Life
and
Gracious
Company
.
   
<EOS>
It
have
be
rumour
,
and
it
be
needless
to
say
the
rumour
originate
in
the
same
base
quarter
,
that
a
certain
male
Chuzzlewit
,
whose
birth
must
be
admit
to
be
involve
in
some
obscurity
,
be
of
very
mean
and
low
descent
.
 
<EOS>
how
stand
the
proof
?
<EOS>
when
the
son
of
that
individual
,
to
whom
the
secret
of
his
father
's
birth
be
suppose
to
have
be
communicate
by
his
father
in
his
lifetime
,
lie
upon
his
deathbed
,
this
question
be
put
to
him
in
a
distinct
,
solemn
,
and
formal
way
:
"
Toby
Chuzzlewit
,
who
be
your
grandfather
?
"
 
<EOS>
to
which
he
,
with
his
last
breath
,
no
less
distinctly
,
solemnly
,
and
formally
reply
:
<EOS>
and
his
word
be
take
down
at
the
time
,
and
sign
by
six
witness
,
each
with
his
name
and
address
in
full
:
"
the
Lord
no
Zoo
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
say
---
it
have
be
say
,
for
human
wickedness
have
no
limit
---
that
there
be
no
Lord
of
that
name
,
and
that
among
the
title
which
have
become
extinct
,
none
at
all
resemble
this
,
in
sound
even
,
be
to
be
discover
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
be
the
irresistible
inference
?
 
<EOS>
reject
a
theory
broach
by
some
well
-
mean
but
mistaken
person
,
that
this
Mr
Toby
Chuzzlewit
's
grandfather
,
to
judge
from
his
name
,
must
surely
have
be
a
Mandarin
(
which
be
wholly
insupportable
,
<EOS>
for
there
be
no
pretence
of
his
grandmother
ever
have
be
out
of
this
country
,
or
of
any
Mandarin
have
be
in
it
within
some
year
of
his
father
's
birth
;
except
those
in
the
tea
-
shop
,
which
can
not
for
a
moment
be
regard
as
have
any
bearing
on
the
question
,
one
way
or
other
)
,
reject
this
hypothesis
,
be
it
not
manifest
that
Mr
Toby
Chuzzlewit
have
either
receive
the
name
imperfectly
from
his
father
,
or
that
he
have
forget
it
,
or
that
he
have
mispronounce
it
?
<EOS>
and
that
even
at
the
recent
period
in
question
,
the
chuzzlewit
be
connect
by
a
bend
sinister
,
or
kind
of
heraldic
over
-
the
-
left
,
with
some
unknown
noble
and
illustrious
House
?
   
<EOS>
from
documentary
evidence
,
yet
preserve
in
the
family
,
the
fact
be
clearly
establish
that
in
the
comparatively
modern
day
of
the
Diggory
Chuzzlewit
before
mention
,
one
of
its
member
have
attain
to
very
great
wealth
and
influence
.
 
<EOS>
throughout
such
fragment
of
his
correspondence
as
have
escape
the
ravage
of
the
moth
(
who
,
in
right
of
their
extensive
absorption
of
the
content
of
deed
and
paper
,
may
be
call
the
general
register
of
the
Insect
World
)
,
we
find
him
make
constant
reference
to
an
uncle
,
in
respect
of
whom
he
would
seem
to
have
entertain
great
expectation
,
as
he
be
in
the
habit
of
seek
to
propitiate
his
favour
by
present
of
plate
,
jewel
,
book
,
watch
,
and
other
valuable
article
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
he
write
on
one
occasion
to
his
brother
in
reference
to
a
gravy
-
spoon
,
the
brother
's
property
,
which
he
(
Diggory
)
would
appear
to
have
borrow
or
otherwise
possess
himself
of
:
"
do
not
be
angry
,
I
have
part
with
it
---
to
my
uncle
.
"
 
<EOS>
on
another
occasion
he
express
himself
in
a
similar
manner
with
regard
to
a
child
's
mug
which
have
be
entrust
to
him
to
get
repair
.
 
<EOS>
on
another
occasion
he
say
,
"
I
have
bestow
upon
that
irresistible
uncle
of
mine
everything
I
ever
possess
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
that
he
be
in
the
habit
of
pay
long
and
constant
visit
to
this
gentleman
at
his
mansion
,
if
,
indeed
,
he
do
not
wholly
reside
there
<EOS>
,
be
manifest
from
the
follow
sentence
:
"
with
the
exception
of
the
suit
of
clothe
I
carry
about
with
me
,
the
whole
of
my
wear
apparel
be
at
present
at
my
uncle
's
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
gentleman
's
patronage
and
influence
must
have
be
very
extensive
,
for
his
nephew
write
,
"
His
interest
be
too
high
"
---
"
It
be
too
much
"
 
---
"
It
be
tremendous
"
---
and
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
still
it
do
not
appear
(
which
be
strange
)
to
have
procure
for
him
any
lucrative
post
at
court
or
elsewhere
,
or
to
have
confer
upon
him
any
other
distinction
than
that
which
be
necessarily
include
in
the
countenance
of
so
great
a
man
,
and
the
being
invite
by
him
to
certain
entertainment
's
,
so
splendid
and
costly
in
their
nature
,
that
he
call
them
"
Golden
Balls
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
needless
to
multiply
instance
of
the
high
and
lofty
station
,
and
the
vast
importance
of
the
Chuzzlewits
,
at
different
period
.
<EOS>
if
it
come
within
the
scope
of
reasonable
probability
that
further
proof
be
require
,
they
may
be
heap
upon
each
other
until
they
form
an
Alps
of
testimony
,
beneath
which
the
bold
scepticism
should
be
crush
and
beat
flat
.
 
<EOS>
as
a
goodly
tumulus
be
already
collect
,
and
decently
batten
up
above
the
Family
grave
,
the
present
chapter
be
content
to
leave
it
<EOS>
as
it
be
:
merely
add
,
by
way
of
a
final
spadeful
,
that
many
chuzzlewit
,
both
male
and
female
,
be
prove
to
demonstration
,
on
the
faith
of
letter
write
by
their
own
mother

to
have
have
chisel
nose

undeniable
chin

secondly

vast

<EOS>
It
be
pretty
late
in
the
autumn
of
the
year
,
when
the
decline
sun
struggle
through
the
mist
which
have
obscure
it
all
day
,
look
brightly
down
upon
a
little
Wiltshire
village
,
within
an
easy
journey
of
the
fair
old
town
of
Salisbury
.
   
<EOS>
like
a
sudden
flash
of
memory
or
spirit
kindle
up
the
mind
of
an
old
man
,
it
shed
a
glory
upon
the
scene
,
in
which
its
depart
youth
and
freshness
seem
to
live
again
.
 
<EOS>
the
wet
grass
sparkle
in
the
light
;
the
scanty
patch
of
verdure
in
the
hedge
---
where
a
few
green
twig
yet
stand
together
bravely
,
resist
to
the
last
the
tyranny
of
nip
wind
and
early
frost

and
brighten
up
;
the
stream
which
have
be
dull
and
sullen
all
day
long
,
break
out
into
a
cheerful
smile
;
the
bird
begin
to
chirp
and
twitter
on
the
naked
bough
,
as
though
the
hopeful
creature
half
believe
that
winter
have
go
by
,
and
spring
have
come
already
.
 
<EOS>
the
vane
upon
the
taper
spire
of
the
old
church
glisten
from
its
lofty
station
in
sympathy
with
the
general
gladness
;
and
from
the
ivy
-
shade
window
such
gleam
of
light
shine
back
upon
the
glowing
sky
,
that
it
seem
as
if
the
quiet
building
be
the
hoarding
-
place
of
twenty
summer
,
and
all
their
ruddiness
and
warmth
be
store

<EOS>
even
those

which
emphatically
whisper

,
grace
the

,
for
the
moment
,
tinge
its
lively
feature
with
no
oppressive
air
of
sadness
.
 
<EOS>
the
fall
leave
,
with
which
the
ground
be
strew
,
give
forth
a
pleasant
fragrance
,
and
subdue
all
harsh
sound
of
distant
foot
and
wheel
create
a
repose
in
gentle
unison
with
the
light
scattering
of
seed
hither
and
thither
by
the
distant
husbandman
,
and
with
the
noiseless
passage
of
the
plough
as
it
turn
up
the
rich
brown
earth
,
and
work
a
graceful
pattern
in
the
stubbled
field

<EOS>
on
the
motionless
branch
of
some
tree
,
autumn
berry
hang
like
cluster
of
coral

as
in
those
fabled
orchard
where

each

watch
their
slow
decay
;
other
again
,
still
wear
theirs
,
have
them
all
crunch
and
crackle
up
,
as
though
they
have
be
burn
;
about
the
stem
of
some
be
pile
,
in
ruddy
mound
,
the
apple
they
have
bear
that
year
;
while
other
(
hardy
evergreen
this

show
somewhat
stern
and
gloomy
in
their
vigour
,
as
charge
by
nature
with
the
admonition
that
it
be
not
to
her
more
sensitive
and
joyous
favourite
she
grant
the
long
term
of

<EOS>
still
athwart
their
dark
bough
,
the
sunbeam
strike
out
path
of
deep
gold
;
and
the
red
light
,
mantle
in
among
their
swarthy
branch
,
use
them
as
foil
to
set
its
brightness
off
,
and
aid
the
lustre
of
the
die
day
.
   
<EOS>
a
moment
,
and
its
glory
be
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
the
sun
go
down
beneath
the
long
dark
line
of
hill
and
cloud
which
pile
up
in
the
west
an
airy
city
,
wall
heap
on
wall
,
and
battlement
on
battlement
;
the
light
be
all
withdraw
;
the
shine
church
turn
cold
and
dark
;
the
stream
forget
to
smile
;
the
bird
be
silent
;
and
the
gloom
of
winter
dwelt
on
everything
.
   
<EOS>
an
evening
wind
uprose
too
,
and
the
slighter
branch
crack
and
rattle
as
they
move
,
in
skeleton
dance
,
to
its
moan
music
.
<EOS>
the
withering
leave
no
longer
quiet
,
hurried
to
and
fro
in
search
of
shelter
from
its
chill
pursuit
;
the
labourer
unyoke
his
horse
,
and
with
head
bend
down
,
trudge
briskly
home
beside
them
;
and
from
the
cottage
window
light
begin
to
glance
and
wink
upon
the
darkening
field
.
   
<EOS>
then
the
village
forge
come
out
in
all
its
bright
importance
.
 
<EOS>
the
lusty
bellow
roar
<EOS>
Ha
ha
!
<EOS>
to
the
clear
fire
,
which
roar
in
turn
,
and
bade
the
shine
spark
dance
gaily
to
the
merry
clinking
of
the
hammer
on
the
anvil
.
 
<EOS>
the
gleaming
iron
,
in
its
emulation
,
sparkle
too
,
and
shed
its
red
-
hot
gem
around
profusely
.
 
<EOS>
the
strong
smith
and
his
man
deal
such
stroke
upon
their
work
,
as
make
even
the
melancholy
night
rejoice
,
and
bring
a
glow
into
its
dark
face
as
it
hover
about
the
door
and
window
,
peep
curiously
in
above
the
shoulder
of
a
dozen
lounger
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
this
idle
company
,
there
they
stand
,
spellbound
by
the
place
,
and
,
cast
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
glance
upon
the
darkness
in
their
rear
,
settle
their
lazy
elbow
more
at
ease
upon
the
sill
,
and
lean
a
little
further
in
:
no
more
disposed
to
tear
themselves
away
than
if
they
have
be
bear
to
cluster
round
the
blazing
hearth
like
so
many
cricket
.
   
<EOS>
out
upon
the
angry
wind
!
<EOS>
how
from
sigh
,
it
begin
to
bluster
round
the
merry
forge
,
bang
at
the
wicket
,
and
grumble
in
the
chimney
,
as
if
it
bully
the
jolly
bellow
for
do
anything
to
order
.
 
<EOS>
and
what
an
impotent
swaggerer
it
be
too
,
for
all
its
noise
;
for
if
it
have
any
influence
on
that
hoarse
companion
,
it
be
but
<EOS>
to
make
him
roar
his
cheerful
song
the
loud
,
and
by
consequence
to
make
the
fire
burn
the
bright
,
and
the
spark
to
dance
more
gaily
yet
;
at
length
,
they
whiz
so
madly
round
and
round
,
that
it
be
too
much
for
such
a
surly
wind
to
bear
;
so
off
<EOS>
it
fly
with
a
howl
give
the
old
sign
before
the
ale
-
house
door
such
a
cuff
as
it
go
,
that
the
Blue
Dragon
be
more
rampant
than
usual
ever
afterwards
,
and
indeed
,
before
Christmas
,
rear
clean
out
of
its
crazy
frame
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
small
tyranny
for
a
respectable
wind
to
go
wreak
its
vengeance
on
such
poor
creature
as
the
fall
leave
,
but
this
wind
happen
to
come
up
with
a
great
heap
of
them
just
after
vent
its
humour
on
the
insulted
Dragon
,
do
so
disperse
and
scatter
them
that
they
flee
away
,
pell
-
mell
,
some
here
,
some
there
,
roll
over
each
other
,
whirl
round
and
round
upon
their
thin
edge
,
take
frantic
flight
into
the
air
,
and
play
all
manner
of
extraordinary
gambol
in
the
extremity
of
their
distress
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
this
enough
for
its
malicious
fury
;
for
not
content
with
drive
them
abroad
,
it
charge
small
party
of
them
and
hunt
them
into
the
wheel
-
wright
's
saw
-
pit
,
and
below
the
plank
and
timber
in
the
yard
,
and
,
scatter
the
sawdust
in
the
air
,
it
look
for
them
underneath
,
and
when
it
do
meet
with
any
,
whew
!
<EOS>
how
it
drive
them
on
and
follow
at
their
heel
!
   
<EOS>
the
scared
leave
only
fly
the
faster
for
all
this
,
and
a
giddy
chase
it
be
;
for
they
get
into
unfrequented
place
,
where
there
be
no
outlet
,
and
where
their
pursuer
keep
them
eddy
round
and
round
at
his
pleasure
;
and
they
creep
under
the
eave
of
house
,
and
cling
tightly
to
the
side
of
hay
-
rick
,
like
bat
;
and
tear
in
at
open
chamber
window
,
and
cower
close
to
hedge
;
and
,
in
short
,
go
anywhere
for
safety
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
oddest
feat
they
achieve
be
,
to
take
advantage
of
the
sudden
opening
of
Mr
Pecksniff
's
front
-
door
,
to
dash
wildly
into
his
passage
;
whither
the
wind
follow
close
upon
them
,
and
find
the
back
-
door
open
,
incontinently
blow
out
the
light
candle
hold
by
Miss
Pecksniff
,
and
slam
the
front
-
door
against
Mr
Pecksniff
who
be
at
that
moment
enter
,
with
such
violence
,
that
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
he
lie
on
his
back
at
the
bottom
of
the
step
.
 
<EOS>
be
by
this
time
weary
of
such
trifling
performance
,
the
boisterous
rover
hurry
away
rejoice
,
roar
over
moor
and
meadow
,
hill
and
flat
,
until
it
get
out
to
sea
,
where
it
meet
with
other
wind
similarly
disposed
,
and
make
a
night
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
Mr
Pecksniff
,
have
receive
from
a
sharp
angle
in
the
bottom
step
but
one
,
that
sort
of
knock
on
the
head
which
light
up
,
for
the
patient
's
entertainment
,
an
imaginary
general
illumination
of
very
bright
short
-
six
,
lie
placidly
stare
at
his
own
street
door
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
would
seem
to
have
be
more
suggestive
in
its
aspect
than
street
door
usually
be
;
for
he
continue
to
lie
there
,
rather
a
lengthy
and
unreasonable
time
,
without
so
much
as
wonder
whether
he
be
hurt
or
no
;
neither
,
when
Miss
Pecksniff
inquire
through
the
key
-
hole
in
a
shrill
voice
,
which
may
have
belong
to
a
wind
in
its
teen
,
"
who
be
there
"
do
he
make
any
reply
;
nor
,
when
Miss
Pecksniff
open
the
door
again
,
and
shade
the
candle
with
her
hand
,
peer
out
,
and
look
provokingly
round
him
,
and
about
him
,
and
over
him
,
and
everywhere
but
at
him
,
do
he
offer
any
remark
,
or
indicate
in
any
manner
the
least
hint
of
a
desire
to
be
pick
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
,
"
cry
Miss
Pecksniff
,
to
the
ideal
inflicter
of
a
runaway
knock
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
catch
it
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
still
Mr
Pecksniff
,
perhaps
from
have
catch
it
already
,
say
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
round
the
corner
now
,
"
cry
Miss
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
it
at
a
venture
,
but
there
be
appropriate
matter
in
it
too
;
for
Mr
Pecksniff
,
be
in
the
act
of
extinguish
the
candle
before
mention
pretty
rapidly
,
and
of
reduce
the
number
of
brass
knob
on
his
street
door
from
four
or
five
hundred
(
which
have
previously
be
juggle
of
their
own
accord
before
his
eye
in
a
very
novel
manner
)
to
a
dozen
or
so
<EOS>
,
may
in
one
sense
have
be
say
to
be
come
round
the
corner
,
and
just
turn
it
.
   
<EOS>
with
a
sharply
deliver
warning
relative
to
the
cage
and
the
constable
,
and
the
stock
and
the
gallow
,
Miss
Pecksniff
be
about
to
close
the
door
again
,
when
Mr
Pecksniff
(
be
still
at
the
bottom
of
the
step
)
raise
himself
on
one
elbow
,
and
sneeze
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
voice
!
"
cry
Miss
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
parent
!
"
   
<EOS>
at
this
exclamation
,
another
Miss
Pecksniff
bounce
out
of
the
parlour
;
and
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
,
with
many
incoherent
expression
,
drag
Mr
Pecksniff
into
an
upright
posture
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pa
!
"
<EOS>
they
cry
in
concert
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pa
!
<EOS>
speak
,
Pa
!
 
<EOS>
do
not
look
so
wild
my
dearest
Pa
!
"
   
<EOS>
but
as
a
gentleman
's
look
,
in
such
a
case
of
all
other
,
be
by
no
mean
under
his
own
control
,
Mr
Pecksniff
continue
to
keep
his
mouth
and
his
eye
very
wide
open
,
and
to
drop
his
low
jaw
,
somewhat
after
the
manner
of
a
toy
nut
-
cracker
;
and
as
his
hat
have
fall
off
,
and
his
face
be
pale
,
and
his
hair
erect
,
and
his
coat
muddy
,
the
spectacle
he
present
be
so
very
doleful
,
that
neither
of
the
Miss
Pecksniffs
could
repress
an
involuntary
screech
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
will
do
,
"
say
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
well
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
be
come
to
himself
!
"
<EOS>
cry
the
young
Miss
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
speak
again
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
the
eld
.
   
<EOS>
with
these
joyful
word
they
kiss
Mr
Pecksniff
on
either
cheek
;
and
bear
him
into
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
presently
,
the
young
Miss
Pecksniff
run
out
again
to
pick

It

antidoting

<EOS>
to
behold

set
up

you

respectfully
invite

<EOS>
and
the
crowning
circumstance
of
the
whole
delightful
catalogue
be
,
that
both
the
fair

be
so
utterly
unconscious
of
all
this

<EOS>
They
have
no
idea

<EOS>
They
no

Mr

<EOS>
Nature
play
them
off

they
have
no

the

<EOS>
It
have
be
remark
that
Mr
Pecksniff
be
a
moral
man
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
be
.
<EOS>
perhaps
there
never
be
a
more
moral
man
than
Mr
Pecksniff
,
especially
in
his
conversation
and
correspondence
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
once
say
of
him
by
a
homely
admirer
,
that
he
have
a
Fortunatus
's
purse
of
good
sentiment
in
his
inside
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
particular
he
be
like
the
girl
in
the
fairy
tale
,
except
that
if
they
be
not
actual
diamond
which
fall
from
his
lip
,
they
be
the
very
bright
paste
,
and
shine
prodigiously
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
most
exemplary
man
;
fuller
of
virtuous
precept
than
a
copy
book
.
 
<EOS>
some
people
liken
him
to
a
direction
-
post
,
which
be
always
tell
the
way
to
a
place
,
and
never
go
there
;
but
these
be
his
enemy
,
the
shadow
cast
by
his
brightness
;
that
be
all
.
 
<EOS>
His
very
throat
be
moral
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
a
good
deal
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
look
over
a
very
low
fence
of
white
cravat
<EOS>
(
whereof
no
man
have
ever
beheld
the
tie
for
he
fasten
it
behind
)
,
and
there

lie
,
<EOS>
a

serene
and
whiskerless

<EOS>
It
seem
to
say
,
on
the
part
of
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
there

no
deception
,
lady
and
gentleman
,
all
be
peace
,
a
holy
calm
pervade
me

"
 
<EOS>
so
do
his
hair
,
just
grizzle
with
an
iron

grey
which
be
all
brush
off
his
forehead
,
and
stand
bolt
upright
,
or
slightly
droop
in
kindre
action
with
his
heavy
eyelid
.
 
<EOS>
so
do
his
person
,
which
be
sleek
though
free
from
corpulency
.
 
<EOS>
so
do
his
manner
,
which
be
soft

oily

<EOS>
in
a
word
,
even
his
plain
black
suit
,
and
state

widower

dangle

all
tend
to
the

of

nothing

it

generally

Mr

with

Mr
Pecksniff

turn
round
again
towards
the
fire
,
and
wave
his
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
door

lady
,
good
evening

Pinch

,
it
be
not
worth
thinking
of

I
be
right

you

wrong

<EOS>
that
be
small
matter

you
will
be
wise
another

"
   
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
clap
that
deject
companion
on
the
shoulder
,
turn
upon
his
heel
,
and
walk
out
into
the
passage
,
whither
poor
Mr
Pinch
,
after
linger
irresolutely
in
the
parlour
for
a
few
second
,
express
in
his
countenance
the
deep
mental
misery
and
gloom
follow
him
.
 
<EOS>
then
they
take
up
the
box
between
them
,
and
sally
out
to
meet
the
mail
.
   
<EOS>
that
fleet
conveyance
pass
,
every
night
,
the
corner
of
a
lane
at
some
distance
;
towards
which
point
they
bend
their
step
.
 
<EOS>
for
some
minute
they
walk
along
in
silence
,
until
at
length
young
Westlock
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
,
and
at
interval
into
another
,
and
another
.
<EOS>
still
there
be
no
response
from
his
companion
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
<EOS>
what
,
Pinch
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
abruptly
,
after
another
lengthen
silence
---
"
You
have
not
half
enough
of

in
you

half
enough

Pinch
with
a
sigh

I

It
be
compliment
to
say
so

repeat
his

tartly
:

all
the
bad
,
you
mean

"
and
yet
,
"
say
Pinch
,
pursue
his
own
thought

not
this
last
remark
on
the
part
of
his
friend
,

I
must
have
a
good
deal
of

make

uncomfortable

do
not

observe
that

almost
start
out

Pinch

<EOS>
"
bless
my

John

it

with
considerable
irritation

"
   
<EOS>
there
appear
to
be
forcible
matter
in
this
inquiry

for
Mr
Pinch
only
repeat
in
an
undertone
that

a
strong
misgiving
on

there
be
scarcely
a
sin
in

such
a

as
ingratitude

when

me
with
that

to
be
guilty

it

he
make
me
miserable

happy

in
the
very
prologue

preface
to
the
first

John
,
you
must
consider
this
,
which
nobody
know
well
than
I
:
that
I
be
bear
for
much
plainer
and
poor
thing
,
that
I
be
not
a
good
hand
for
his
kind
of
business
,

have
no
talent
for
it

indeed
for
anything
else

odd
and
end
that
be
of
no
use

service
to
anybody

"
   
<EOS>
He
say
this
with
so
much
earnestness
,

in
a
tone
so
full
of
feeling
,
that
his
companion
instinctively
change
his
manner
as
he
sit
down
on
the
box
(
they
have
by
this
time
reach
the
finger
-
post
at
the
end
of
the
lane
)
;
motion
him
to
sit
down
beside
him

lay
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder

"
I

He
be

in

he
keep

They

with

rest
content
with

idle

they
be
now
remarkable
rather
for
hold
aloof
from
the
soft
sex
and
discourage
their
visit
(
especially
on
Saturday
night
)
,
than
for
rudely
insist

of

<EOS>
nor
be
this
tribute
to

so
wide
a
digression
into
the

of
Natural

never

have
there
be
such

within
its

as
on

when
there
be
such
a
hurrying
up

down
stair

such
a
glancing
of
light

such
a
whispering
of
voice
,
such
a
smoking

sputtering
of

newly

such
an

such

<EOS>
an
old
gentleman
and
a
young
lady
,
travelling
,
unattende
,
in
a
rusty
old
chariot
with
post

horse
;
come
nobody

whence
and
go
nobody
know
whither

have
turn
out
of

high

and
drive
unexpectedly
to
the
Blue
Dragon
;
and
here
be
the
old
gentleman
,
who
have
take
this
step
by
reason
of
his
sudden
illness
in
the
carriage
,
suffer
the
most
horrible
cramp
and
spasm
,
yet
protest
and
vow
in
the
very
midst
of
his
pain
,
that
he
would
not
have
a
doctor
send
for
,
and
would
not
take
any
remedy
but
those
which
the
young
lady
administer
from
a
small
medicine

chest
,
and
would
not
,
in
a
word
,
do
anything
but
terrify
the
landlady
out
of
her
five
wit
,
and
obstinately
refuse
compliance
with
every
suggestion
that
be
make
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
of
all
the
five
hundred
proposal
for
his
relief
which
the
good
woman
pour
out
in
less
than
half
an
hour
,
he
would
entertain
but
one
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
that
he
should
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
in
the
preparation
of
his
bed
and
the
arrangement
of
his
chamber
,
that
all
the
stir
be
make
in
the
room
behind
the
Dragon
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
,
beyond
all
question
,
very
ill
,
and
suffer
exceedingly
;
not
the
less
,
perhaps
,
because
he
be
a
strong
and
vigorous
old
man
,
with
a
will
of
iron
,
and
a
voice
of
brass
.
 
<EOS>
but
neither
the
apprehension
which
he
plainly
entertain
,
at
time
,
for
his
life
,
nor
the
great
pain
he
undergo
,
influence
his
resolution
in
the
least
degree
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
no
person
send
for
.
 
<EOS>
the
bad
he
grow
,
the
more
rigid
and
inflexible
<EOS>
he
become
in
his
determination
.
 
<EOS>
if
they
send
for
any
person
to
attend
him
,
man
,
woman
,
or
child
,
he
would
leave
the
house
directly
(
so
he
tell
them
)
,
though
he
quit
it
on
foot
,
and
die
upon
the
threshold
of
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
there
be
no
medical
practitioner
actually
resident
in
the
village
,
but
a
poor
apothecary
who
be
also
a
grocer
and
general
dealer
,
the
landlady
have
,
upon
her
own
responsibility
,
send
for
him
,
in
the
very
first
burst
and
outset
of
the
disaster
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
it
follow
,
as
a
necessary
result
of
his

want
,
that
he
be
not
at

.
 
<EOS>
He
have
go
some
mile
away
,
and
be
not
expect
home
until
late
at
night
;
so
<EOS>
the
landlady
,
be
by
this
time
pretty
well
beside
herself
,
dispatch
the
same
messenger
in
all
haste
for
Mr
Pecksniff
,
as
a
learned
man
who
could
bear
a
deal
of
responsibility
,
and
a
moral
man
who
could
administer
a
world
of
comfort
to
a
troubled
mind
.
 
<EOS>
that
her
guest
have
<EOS>
need
of
some
efficient
service
under
the
latter
head
be
obvious
enough
from
the
restless
expression
,
import
,
however
,
rather
a
worldly
than
a
spiritual
anxiety
,
to
which
he
give
frequent
utterance
.
   
<EOS>
from
this
last
-
mention
secret
errand
,
the
messenger
return
with
no
well
news
than
from
the
first
;
Mr
Pecksniff
be
not
at
home
.
<EOS>
however
,
they
get
the
patient
into
bed
without
him
;
and
in
the
course
of
two
hour
,
he
gradually
become
so
far
well
that
there
be
much
long
interval
than
at
first
between
his
term
of
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
by
degree
,
he
cease
to
suffer
at
all
;
though
his
exhaustion
be
occasionally
so
great
that
it
suggest
hardly
less
alarm
than
his
actual
endurance
have
do
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
in
one
of
his
interval
of
repose
,
when
,
look
round
with
great
caution
,
and
reach
uneasily
out
of
his
nest
of
pillow
,
he
endeavour
,
with
a
strange
air
of
secrecy
and
distrust
,
to
make
use
of
the
writing
material
which
he
have
order
to
be
place
on
a
table
beside
him
,
that
the
young
lady
and
the
mistress
of
the
Blue
Dragon
find
themselves
sit
side
by
side
before
the
fire
in
the
sick
chamber
.
   
<EOS>
the
mistress
of
the
Blue
Dragon
be
in
outward
appearance
<EOS>
just
what
a
landlady
should
be
:
broad
,
buxom
,
comfortable
,
and
good
looking
,
with
a
face
of
clear
red
and
white
,
which
,
by
its
jovial
aspect
,
at
once
bore
testimony
to
her
hearty
participation
in
the
good
thing
of
the
larder
and
cellar
,
and
to
their
thriving
and
healthful
influence
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
widow
,
but
year
ago
have
pass
through
her
state
of
weed

and
burst
into
flower
again

in
full
bloom
she
have
continue
ever
since

in
full
bloom
she
be

rose
on

rose
in
her
cap

rose
in

aye

and
rose

worth
the
gathering
too

on

for
that
matter

<EOS>
She
have
still
a
bright
black
eye
,
and
jet
black
hair
;
be
comely
,
dimple
,
plump
,
and
tight
as
a
gooseberry
;
and
though
she
be
not
exactly
what
the
world
call
young

you
may
make
an
affidavit
,
on
trust
,
before
any
mayor

magistrate
in
Christendom
,
that
there
be
a
great
many
young
lady
in
the
world
(
blessing
on
them
one
and
all
!
)
<EOS>
whom
you
would
not
like
half
as
well
,
or
admire
half
as
much
,
as
the
beam
hostess
of
the
Blue
Dragon
.
   
<EOS>
as
this
fair
matron
sit
beside
the
fire
,
she
glance
occasionally
with
all
the
pride
of
ownership
,
about
the
room
;
which
be
a
large
apartment
,
such
as
one
may
see
in
country
place
,
with
a
low
roof
and
a
sink
flooring
,
all
downhill
from
the
door
,
and
a
descent
of
two
step
on
the
inside
so
exquisitely
unexpected
,
that
stranger
,
despite
the
most
elaborate
cautioning
,
usually
dive
in
head
first
,
as
into
a
plunging
-
bath
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
none
of
your
frivolous
and
preposterously
bright
bedroom
,
where
nobody
can
close
an
eye
with
any
kind
of
propriety
or
decent
regard
to
the
association
of
idea
;
but
it
be
a
good
,
dull
,
leaden
,
drowsy
place
,
where
every
article
of
furniture
remind
you
that
you
come
there
to
sleep
,
and
that
you
be
expect
to
go
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
wakeful
reflection
of
the
fire
there
,
as
in
your
modern
chamber
,
which
upon
the
dark
night
have
a
watchful
consciousness
of
french
polish
;
the
old
spanish
mahogany
wink
at
it
now
and
then
,
as
a
doze
cat
or
dog
might
,
nothing
more
.
 
<EOS>
the
very
size
and
shape
,
and
hopeless
immovability
of
the
bedstead
,
and
wardrobe
,
and
in
a
minor
degree
of
even
the
chair
and
table
,
provoke
sleep
;
they
be
plainly
apoplectic
and
dispose
to
snore
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
stare
portrait
to
remonstrate
with
you
for
be
lazy
;
no
round
-
eyed
bird
upon
the
curtain
,
disgustingly
wide
awake
,
and
insufferably
pry
.
 
<EOS>
the
thick
neutral
hanging
,
and
the
dark
blind
,
and
the
heavy
heap
of
bed
-
clothe
,
be
all
design
to
hold
in
sleep
,
and
act
as
nonconductor
to
the
day
and
get
up
.
 
<EOS>
even
the
old
stuff
fox
upon
the
top
of
the
wardrobe
be
devoid
of
any
spark
of
vigilance
,
for
his
glass
eye
have
fall
out
,
and
he
slumber
as
he
stand
.
   
<EOS>
the
wander
attention
of
the
mistress
of
the
Blue
Dragon
rove
to
these
thing
but
twice
or
thrice
,
and
then
for
but
an
instant
at
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
soon
desert
them
,
and
even
the
distant
bed
with
its
strange
burden
,
for
the
young
creature
immediately
before
her
,
who
,
with
her
downcast
eye
intently
fix
upon
the
fire
,
sit
wrap
in
silent
meditation
.
   
<EOS>
She
be
very
young
;
apparently
no
more
than
seventeen
;
timid
and
shrink
in
her
manner
,
and
yet
with
a
great
share
of
self
possession
and
control
over
her
emotion
than
usually
belong
to
a
far
more
advanced
period
of
female
life
.
 
<EOS>
this
she
have
abundantly
show
,
but
now
,
in
her
tending
of
the
sick
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
short
in
stature
;
and
her
figure
be
slight
,
as
become
her
year
;
but
all
the
charm
of
youth
and
maidenhood
set
it
off
,
and
cluster
on
her
gentle
brow
.
 
<EOS>
Her
face
be
very
pale
,
in
part
no
doubt
from
recent
agitation
.
 
<EOS>
Her
dark
brown
hair
,
disorder
from
the
same
cause
,
have
fall
negligently
from
its
bond
,
and
hang
upon
her
neck
;
for
which
instance
of
its
waywardness
no
male
observer
would
have
have
the
heart
to
blame
it
.
   
<EOS>
Her
attire
be
that
of
a
lady
,
but
extremely
plain
;
and
in
her
manner
,
even
when
she
sit
as
still
as
she
do
then
,
there
be
an
indefinable
something
which
appear
to
be
in
kindred
with
her
scrupulously
unpretende
dress
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
sit
,
at
first
look
anxiously
towards
the
bed
;
but
see
that
the
patient
remain
quiet
,
and
be
busy
with
his
writing
,
she
have
softly
move
her
chair
into
its
present
place
;
partly
,
as
it
seem
,
from
an
instinctive
consciousness
that
he
desire
to
avoid
observation
;
and
partly
that
she
may
,
unseen
by
him
,
give
some
vent
to
the
natural
feeling
she
have
hitherto
suppress
.
   
<EOS>
of
all
this
,
and
much
more
,
the
rosy
landlady
of
the
Blue
Dragon
take
as
accurate
note
and
observation
as
only
woman
can
take
of
woman
.
 
<EOS>
and
at
length
she
say
,
in
a
voice
too
low
,
she
know
,
to
reach
the
bed
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
see
the
gentleman
in
this
way
before
,
miss
?
 
<EOS>
be
he
use

these
attack

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
see
him
very
ill
before

but
not
so
ill
as
he
have
be
tonight
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
a
Providence

"
say
the
landlady
of

Dragon

"
that
you

<EOS>
"
They

<EOS>
We
never

them

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh

"
think
the
hostess
,
"
then
we
be
in
the
habit
of
travelling
,
and
of
travel
together
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
be
so
conscious
of
express
this
in
her
face

that
meet
the
young

eye
immediately
afterwards
,
and
be
a

she
be
rather
confused

<EOS>
"
the

she
resume

after
a
short
pause

<EOS>
"
Father

I
should

return
the

,
sensible
of

make
an
awkward
mistake

<EOS>
"

the
young

<EOS>
"

she
add

"
oh

return
the
landlady
,
still
more
embarrassed
than
before

"
how
could
I
be
so
very
much
mistaken
;
knowing

as
anybody

be
ill

he

<EOS>
that
I

"
 
<EOS>
but
when
she
have
proceed
thus
far
,
she
glance
involuntarily
at
the
third
finger
of
the
young
lady
's
left
hand
,
and
falter
again
;
for

forth
the

hold
it
in
the
flame

he
extinguish
the
light

turn
his
face
away
with
a
heavy
sigh

draw
the
coverlet
about
his
head

lie
quite
still
.
   
<EOS>
this
destruction
of
the
paper
,
both
as
be
strangely
inconsistent
with
the
labour
he
have
devote
to
it
,
and
as
involve
considerable
danger
of
fire
to
the
Dragon
,
occasion
Mrs

not
a
little
consternation

<EOS>
but
the
young

evince
no
surprise

curiosity

whisper
her
,
with
many
thank
for
her
solicitude

company

that
she
would
remain
there
some
time
longer

that
she
beg
her
not

her
watch

Mrs

have
her
full
share

dividend
of
that
large
capital
of
curiosity

be
inherit
by
her
sex

and
at
another
time
it
may
have
be
difficult
so
to
impress
this
hint
upon
her
as
to
induce
her
to
take
it

<EOS>
but
now
,
in
sheer
wonder

amazement
at
these
mystery

she
withdraw
at
once
,
and
repair
straightway
to
her
own
little
parlour
below
stair
,
sit
down
in
her
easy
-
chair
with
unnatural
composure
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
very
crisis
,
a
step
be
hear
in
the
entry
,
and
Mr
Pecksniff
,
look
sweetly
over
the
half

door

into

snug
privacy
beyond

murmur
:

"

a

repeat
Mr

.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
!
"
   
<EOS>
now
there
be
nothing
that
one
may
call
decidedly
original
in
this
remark
,
nor
can
it
be
exactly
say
to
have
contain
any
wise
precept
theretofore
unknown
to
mankind
,
or
to
have
open
any
hide
source
of
consolation
;
but
Mr
Pecksniff
's
manner
be
so
bland
,
and
he
nod
his
head
so
soothingly
,
and
show
in
everything
such
an
affable
sense
of
his
own
excellence
,
that
anybody
would
have
be
,
as
Mrs
Lupin
be
,
comfort
by
the
mere
voice
and
presence
of
such
a
man
;
and
,
though
he
have
merely
say
"
a
verb
must
agree
with
its
nominative
case
in
number
and
person
,
my
good
friend

"
or
"
eight
time
eight
be
sixty
-
four
,
my
worthy
soul

must
have
feel
deeply
grateful
to
him
for
his
humanity
and
wisdom

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
how
,
"
ask
Mr
Pecksniff
,
draw
off
his
glove
and
warm
his
hand
before
the
fire
,
as
benevolently
as
if
they

here
again

Mr
Pecksniff
make
it
his
own
and
console
her
with
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
much
when
Mrs
Lupin
say
it
,
but
it
be
a
whole
book
when
Mr
Pecksniff
say
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
observe
,
"
he
seem
to
say

and
through
me

morality
in
general
remark

that

there

for

Mr

but
though

this
in

plain

he
do
not
speak
a

<EOS>
He
only
shake
his
head
;
disparagingly
of
himself
too

<EOS>
"
I

continue
the
landlady

first
look
round
to
assure
herself
that

look
down

warm
his

as

observe
the

earnestly

Touching

write
down

unblushingly
maintain
that
he
always
say
of
what
be
very

<EOS>
with
that
he
take
off
his
great

coat
,
and
have
run
his
finger
through
his
hair
,
thrust
one
hand
gently
in
the
bosom
of
his
waist

coat
and
meekly
sign
to
her
to

They
go

to
his

and
substitute
another
word
:
"
this
young
stranger

Mrs

will
excuse
me
for
reply
briefly
,
that
I
reside
in
this
village

undeserved

sympathy

<EOS>
with
these
impressive
word
,
Mr
Pecksniff
pass
over
to
the
bedside
,
where
,
after
pat
the
counterpane
once
or
twice
in
a
very
solemn
manner
,
as
if
by
that
mean
he
gain
a
clear
insight
into
the
patient
's
disorder
,
he
take
his
seat
in
a
large
arm
-
chair
,
and
in
an
attitude
of
some
thoughtfulness
and
much
comfort
,
wait
for
his
waking
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
objection
the
young
lady
urge
to
Mrs
Lupin
go
no
further
,
for
nothing
more
be
say
to
Mr

and
Mr
Pecksniff
say
nothing
more
to
anybody
else

<EOS>
full
half
an
hour
elapse
before
the
old
man
stir
,
but
at
length
he
turn
himself
in
bed
,
and
,
though
not
yet
awake
,
give
token
that
his
sleep
be
draw
to
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
by
little
and
little
he
remove
the
bed
-
clothe
from
about
his
head
,
and
turn
still
more
towards
the
side
where
Mr
Pecksniff
sit
.
 
<EOS>
in
course
of
time
his
eye
open
;
and
he
lie
for
a
few
moment
as
people
newly
rouse
sometimes
will
,
gaze
indolently
at
his
visitor
,
without
any
distinct
consciousness
of
his
presence
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
remarkable
in
these
proceeding
,
except
the
influence
they
work
on
Mr
Pecksniff
,
which
could
hardly
have
be
surpass
by
the
most
marvellous
of
natural
phenomenon
.
 
<EOS>
gradually
his
hand
become
tightly
clasp
upon
the
elbow
of
the
chair
,
his
eye
dilate
with
surprise
,
his
mouth
open
,
his
hair
stand
more
erect
upon
his
forehead
than
its
custom
be
,
until
,
at
length
,
when
the
old
man
rise
in
bed
,
and
stare
at
him
with
scarcely
less
emotion
than
he
show
himself

the
Pecksniff

be
all
resolve

he
exclaim
aloud
:

His
consternation
of
surprise

so
genuine

with
all
the
disposition
that
he
clearly
entertain
to
believe
it
assume

be
convince
of
its
reality

"
I

,
bitterly
:

why

I
dream
of
this
fellow

he

,
lie
down
again
,

turn
away
his
face
,
"

"
My

the

shake
his
grey
head
to
and
fro
upon
the
pillow
,

throw
up
his
hand

in

<EOS>
"
pray
do
not

hasty

say
Pecksniff
,
in
a
tone
that
be
at
once
in
the
sublime
degree
compassionate
and
dispassionate
;
for
he
have
by
this
time
recover
from
his
surprise
,
and
be
in
full
possession
of
his
virtuous
self

Mr

Mr

watchful
of
the
effect
he
make

it
must
be
plain
to
you

I
be
sure

by
this

insinuate
myself
into

I
should
have
be

careful
not

address
you
as

;
know
your
humour
,

be
quite
certain
beforehand
that
I
could
not

a
bad
letter
of
recommendation

<EOS>
Martin
make
not
any
verbal
answer
;
but
he
as
clearly
imply
though
only
by
a
motion
of
his
leg
beneath
the
bed

clothe
,
that
there
be
reason
in
this
,
and
that
he
could
not
dispute
it

much

<EOS>
"
no

Mr

keep
his

in
his

as
though
he
be
ready

on
the
short
notice
,
to
produce
his
heart
for
Martin
Chuzzlewit
's
inspection

come
here
to
offer
my
service

a
stranger

<EOS>
I
make
no

lie
on

I
regard
you

<EOS>
have
say
which
,
Mr

throw
himself
back
in
the
easy

chair
;
so
radiant
with
ingenuous
honesty
,
that
Mrs

almost
wonder
not
to
see
a
stain

glass
glory

such
as

about

long
pause

increase
restlessness

his
posture
several
time

<EOS>
Mrs
Lupin
and
the
young
lady
gaze
in
silence
at
the
counterpane

<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
toy
abstractedly
with
his
eye

glass
,
and
keep
his
eye
shut
,
that
he
may
ruminate
the
well
.
   
<EOS>
"
eh

"
he
say
at
last
,
open
them
suddenly
,
and
look
towards
the
bed

I
beg
your
pardon

think
you
speak

be
as
good

he
can
have

"
   
<EOS>
this
last
note
of
interrogation
bore
reference
to
another
change
of
posture
on
the
old
man
's
part
,
which
bring
his
face
towards
Mr
Pecksniff
for
the
first
time

have
turn
away
from
him

<EOS>
"
if

continue
that
gentleman
,
after
another
pause
,
"
you
may
command
my
leisure

I
must
stipulate
,
in
justice
to
myself
,
that
you
do
so

as
to
a
stranger
,
strictly
as
to
a
stranger

"
   
<EOS>
now
if
Mr
Pecksniff
know
,
from
anything
Martin
Chuzzlewit
have
express
in
gesture
,
that
he
want
to
speak
to
him
,
he
could
only
have
find
it
out
on
some
such
principle
as
prevail
in
melodramas
,
and
in
virtue
of
which
the
elderly
farmer
with
the
comic
son
always
know
what
the
dumb
girl
mean
when
she
take
refuge
in
his
garden
,
and
relate
her
personal
memoir
in
incomprehensible
pantomime
.
 
<EOS>
but
without
stop
to
make
any
inquiry
on
this
point
,
Martin
Chuzzlewit
sign
to
his
young
companion
to
withdraw
,
which
she
immediately
do
,
along
with
the
landlady
leave
him
and
Mr
Pecksniff
alone
together
.
 
<EOS>
for
some
time
they
look
at
each
other
in
silence
;
or
rather
the
old
man
look
at
Mr
Pecksniff
,
and
Mr
Pecksniff
again
close
his
eye
on
all
outward
object
,
take
an
inward
survey
of
his
own
breast
.
 
<EOS>
that
it
amply
repay
him
for
his
trouble
,
and
afford
a
delicious
and
enchanting
prospect
,
be
clear
from
the
expression
of
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
wish
me
to
speak
to
you
as
to
a
total
stranger
,
"
say
the
old
man
,
"
do
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
reply
,
by
a
shrug
of
his
shoulder
and
an
apparent
turning
round
of
his
eye
in
their
socket
before
he
open
them
,
that
he
be
still
reduce
to
the
necessity
of
entertain
that
desire

<EOS>
"
You
shall
be
gratify

Martin

<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
be

so
rich

wealthy

nothing

unhappiness

<EOS>
It
would
be
no
description
of
Mr
Pecksniff
's
gentleness
of
manner
to
adopt
the
common
parlance
,
and
say
that
he
look
at
this
moment
as
if
butter
would
not
melt
in
his
mouth

<EOS>
He
rather
look
as

make
out

by
churn
the
milk

kindness

hideous

"
   
<EOS>
a
thought
arise
in
Pecksniff
's
mind
,
which
must
have
instantly
mount
to
his
face
,
or
Martin
Chuzzlewit
would
not
have
resume
as
quickly

as
sternly
as
he
do
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
would
advise
me
for
my
peace

mind

to
get
rid
of
this
source
of
misery

transfer
it
to
some
one
who
could
bear
it
better
.
<EOS>
even
you

perhaps
,
would
rid
me
of
a
burden

so
grievously

Mr

in

ensue
upon

make

nor

"
hear

I

engender

by

even
with

I

up

I

you
remind

the

take

while
I
live
I
make
her
an

not
extravagant
in

not
stint

there

a
compact

no

cajolery
shall
ever

that

shall
call

no

Judge

Chapter
04

<EOS>
from
which
it
will
appear
that
if
union
be
strength
,
and
family
affection
be
pleasant
to
contemplate
,
the
chuzzlewit
be
the
strong
and
most
agreeable
family

<EOS>
that
worthy
man
Mr
Pecksniff
have
take
leave
of
his
cousin
in
the
solemn
term
recite
in
the
last
chapter
,
withdraw
to
his
own
home
,
and
remain
there
three
whole
day
;
not
so
much
as
go
out
for
a
walk
beyond
the
boundary
of
his
own
garden
,
lest
he
should
be
hastily
summon
to
the
bedside
of
his
penitent
and
remorseful
relative
,
whom
,
in
his
ample
benevolence
,
he
have
make
up
his
mind
to
forgive
unconditionally
,
and
to
love
on
any
term
.
 
<EOS>
but
such
be
the
obstinacy
and
such
the
bitter
nature
of
that
stern
old
man
,
that
no
repentant
summon
come
;
and
the
fourth
day
find
Mr
Pecksniff
apparently
much
farther
from
his
christian
object
than
the
first
.
   
<EOS>
during
the
whole
of
this
interval
,
he
haunt
the
Dragon
at
all
time
and
season
in
the
day
and
night
,
and
,
return
good
for
evil
evince
the
deep
solicitude
in
the
progress
of
the
obdurate
invalid
,
in
so
much
that
Mrs
Lupin
be
fairly
melt
by
his
disinterested
anxiety
(
for
he
often
particularly
require
her
to
take
notice
that
he
would
do
the
same
by
any
stranger
or
pauper
in
the
like
condition
)
,
and
shed
many
tear
of
admiration
and
delight
.
   
<EOS>
meantime
,
old
Martin
Chuzzlewit
remain
shut
up
in
his
own
chamber
,
and
see
no
person
but
his
young
companion
,
save
the
hostess
of
the
Blue
Dragon
,
who
be
,
at
certain
time
,
admit
to
his
presence
.
<EOS>
so
surely
as
she
come
into
the
room
,
however
,
Martin
feign
to
fall
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
when
he
and
the
young
lady
be
alone
,
that
he
would
utter
a
word
,
even
in
answer
to
the
simple
inquiry
;
though
Mr
Pecksniff
could
make
out
,
by
hard
listening
at
the
door
,
that
they
two
be
leave
together
,
he
be
talkative
enough
.
   
<EOS>
It
happen
on
the
fourth
evening
,
that
Mr
Pecksniff
walk
,
as
usual
,
into
the
bar
of
the
Dragon
and
find
no
Mrs
Lupin
there
,
go
straight
upstairs
;
purpose
,
in
the
fervour
of
his
affectionate
zeal
,
to
apply
his
ear
once
more
to
the
keyhole
,
and
quiet
his
mind
by
assure
himself
that
the
hard
-
hearted
patient
be
go
on
well
.
 
<EOS>
It
happen
that
Mr
Pecksniff
,
come
softly
upon
the
dark
passage
into
which
a
spiral
ray
of
light
usually
dart
through
the
same
keyhole
,
be
astonish
to
find
no
such
ray
visible
;
and
it
happen
that
Mr
Pecksniff
,
when
he
have
feel
his
way
to
the
chamber
-
door
,
stoop
hurriedly
down
to
ascertain
by
personal
inspection
whether
the
jealousy
of
the
old
man
have
cause
this
keyhole
to
be
stop
on
the
inside
,
bring
his
head
into
such
violent
contact
with
another
head
that
he
could
not
help
utter
in
an
audible
voice
the
monosyllable
"
oh
!
"
which
be
,
as
it
be
,
sharply
unscrewed
and
jerk
out
of
him
by
very
anguish
.
 
<EOS>
It
happen
then
,
and
lastly
,
that
Mr
Pecksniff
find
himself
immediately
collar
by
something
which
smell
like
several
damp
umbrella
,
a
barrel
of
beer
,
a
cask
of
warm
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
and
a
small
parlour
-
full
of
stale
tobacco
smoke
,
mixed
;
and
be
straightway
lead
downstairs
into
the
bar
from
which
he
have
lately
come
,
where
he
find
himself
stand
opposite
to
,
and
in
the
grasp
of
,
a
perfectly
strange
gentleman
of
still
strange
appearance
who
,
with
his
disengaged
hand
,
rub
his
own
head
very
hard
,
and
look
at
him
,
Pecksniff
,
with

evil
countenance

<EOS>
the
gentleman
be
of
that
order
of
appearance
which
be
currently
term
shabby
-
genteel
,
though
in
respect
of
his
dress
he
can
hardly
be
say
to
have
be
in
any
extremity
,
as
his
finger
be
a
long
way
out
of
his
glove
,
and
the
sol
of
his
foot
be
at
an
inconvenient
distance
from
the
upper
leather
of
his
boot
.
 
<EOS>
His
nether
garment
be
of
a
bluish
grey
---
violent
in
its
colour
once
,
but
sober
now
by
age
and
dinginess
---
and
be
so
stretch
and
strain
in
a
tough
conflict
between
his
brace
and
his
strap
,
that
they
appear
every
moment
in
danger
of
fly
asunder
at
the
knee
.
<EOS>
His
coat
,
in
colour
blue
and
of
a
military
cut

be
button
and
frog
up
to
his
chin
.
 
<EOS>
His
cravat
be
,
in
hue
and
pattern
,
like
one
of
those
mantle
which
hairdresser
be
accustomed
to
wrap
about
their
client
,
during
the
progress
of
the
professional
mystery
.
<EOS>
His
hat
have
arrive
at
such
a
pass
that
it
would
have
be
hard
to
determine
whether
it
be
originally
white
or
black
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
wear
a
moustache
---
a
shaggy
moustache
too
;
nothing
in
the
meek
and
merciful
way
,
but
quite
in
the
fierce
and
scornful
style
;
the
regular
satanic
sort
of
thing
---
and
he
wear
,
besides
,
a
vast
quantity
of
unbrushed
hair
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
dirty
and
very
jaunty
;
very
bold
and
very
mean
;
very
swaggering
and
very
slinking
;
very
much
like
a
man
who
may
have
be
something
well
,
and
unspeakably
like
a
man
who
deserve
to
be
something
bad
.

on

again

behoof

call
upon
him
thereby
to
take
notice
that
the
requisition
of
small
loan
be
another
instance
of
the
peculiarity
of
genius
as
develop
in
his
friend

that
he

Tigg
,
wink
at
the
same
,
because
of
the
strong
metaphysical
interest
which
these
weakness
possess

and
that
in
reference
to
his
own
personal
advocacy
of
such
small
advance

he
merely
consult
the
humour
of
his

regard

his
own
advantage

necessity

oh

Chiv

Chiv

Mr

profound
contemplation
after
dismiss
this
piece
of
pantomime

<EOS>
"
You
be
,
upon
my
life

a
strange

little
frailty

<EOS>
if
there
have
never

I
should
have
be
quite
certain
from
my
observation

there

spot
on

sun

I
wish

hot
weather

life
be
a
riddle
;
a
most
infernally
hard
riddle
to
guess
,
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
My
own
opinion
,
that
like
that
celebrate
conundrum
,
"
why
be
a
man
in
jail
like
a
man
out
of
jail
?

there
be
no

upon

there
be
no
use
in

about
it

ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!

<EOS>
with
which
consolatory
deduction
from
the
gloomy
premise

himself
by
a
great
effort

proceed
in
his
former
strain

now

Mr

,
you
be
the
cousin
of
the
testator
upstairs
and
we
be
the
nephew
<EOS>
---
I
say
we
,
mean
Chiv
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
in
all
essential
point
you
be
more
nearly
relate
to
him
than
we
be
.
<EOS>
very
good
.
 
<EOS>
if
so
,
so
be
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
can
not
get
at
him
,
neither
can
we
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
you
my
bright
word
of
honour
,
sir
,
that
I
have
be
look
through
that
keyhole
with
short
interval
of
rest
,
ever
since
nine
o'clock
this
morning
,
in
expectation
of
receive
an
answer
to
one
of
the
most
moderate
and
gentlemanly
application
for
a
little
temporary
assistance
---
only
fifteen
pound
,
and
my
security
 
---
that
the
mind
of
man
can
conceive
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
sir
,
he
be
perpetually
closet
with
,
and
pour
his
whole
confidence
into
the
bosom
of
,
a
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
now
I
say
decisively
with
regard
to
this
state
of
circumstance
,
that
it
will
not
do
;
that
it
will
not
act
;
that
it
can
not
be
;
and
that
it
must
not
be
suffer
to
continue
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
every
man
,
"
say
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
have
a
right
,
an
undoubted
right

(
which
I
,
for
one
,
would
not
call
in
question
for
any
earthly
consideration
;
<EOS>
oh
no
!
)
to
regulate
his
own
proceeding
by
his
own
liking
and
disliking
,
suppose
they
be
not
immoral
and
not
irreligious
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
feel
in
my
own
breast
,
that
Mr
Chuzzlewit
do
not
regard

me
,
for
instance
;
say
me
---
with
exactly
that
amount
of
christian
love
which
should
subsist
between
us

<EOS>
I
may
feel
grieve
and
hurt
at
the
circumstance

still
I
may
not
rush
to
the
conclusion
that
Mr
Chuzzlewit
be
wholly
without
a
justification
in
all
his
coldness

Heaven
forbid
!

Mr

Pecksniff
even
more
gravely

how
could
Mr
Chuzzlewit
be
prevent
from
have
these
peculiar
and
most
extraordinary
confidence
of
which
you
speak
;
the
existence
of
which
I
must
admit

which
I
can
not

deplore

for
his

him
wistfully

Mr

as

he
draw
himself
aloft

suddenly

of
the
moral

Mr

now
that

up

the

<EOS>
cry
Tigg

gravely
nod
his

if
some
ground
of
objection
occur
to
him
at
that
moment
for
the
first
time
,
"
it
be
very
possible
you
may
be
right
.
 
<EOS>
Would
you
entertain
the
same
sort
of
objection
to
lend
me
five
shilling
now
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
could
not
do
it
,
indeed
,
"
say
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
not
even
half
-
a
-
crown
,
perhaps
?
"
urge
Mr
Tigg
.
   
<EOS>
"
not
even
half
-
a
-
crown
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
then
we
come
,
"
say
Mr
Tigg
,
"
to
the
ridiculously
small
amount
of
eighteen
penny
.
 
<EOS>
ha
!
ha
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
that
,
"
say
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
would
be
equally
objectionable
.
"
   
<EOS>
on
receipt
of
this
assurance
,
Mr
Tigg
shake
him
heartily
by
both
hand
,
protest
with
much
earnestness
,
that
he
be
one
of
the
most
consistent
and
remarkable
man
he
have
ever
meet
,
and
that
he
desire
the
honour
of
his
well
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
He
moreover
observe
that
there
be
many
little
characteristic
about
his
friend
Slyme
,
of
which
he
could
by
no
mean
,
as
a
man
of
strict
honour
,
approve
;
but
that
he
be
prepared
to
forgive
him
all
these
slight
drawback
,
and
much
more
,
in
consideration
of
the
great
pleasure
he
himself
have
that
day
enjoy
in
his
social
intercourse
with
Mr
Pecksniff
,
which
have
give
him
a
far
high
and
more
enduring
delight
than
the
successful
negotiation
of
any
small
loan
on
the
part
of
his
friend
could
possibly
have
impart
.
 
<EOS>
with
which
remark
he
would
beg
leave
,
he
say
,
to
wish
Mr
Pecksniff
a
very
good
evening
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
he
take
himself
off
;
as
little
abash
by
his
recent
failure
as
any
gentleman
would
desire
to
be
.
   
<EOS>
the
meditation
of
Mr
Pecksniff
that
evening
at
the
bar
of
the
Dragon
,
and
that
night
in
his
own
house
,
be
very
serious
and
grave
indeed
;
the
more
especially
as
the
intelligence
he
have
receive
from
Messrs
Tigg
and
Slyme
touch
the
arrival
of
other
member
of
the
family
,
be
fully
confirm
on
more
particular
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
Spottletoes
have
actually
go
straight
to
the
Dragon
,
where
they
be
at
that
moment
house
and
mount
guard
,
and
where
their
appearance
have
occasion
such
a
vast
sensation
that
Mrs
Lupin
,
scent
their
errand
before
they
have
be
under
her
roof
half
an
hour
,
carry
the
news
herself
with
all
possible
secrecy
straight
to
Mr
Pecksniff
's
house
;
indeed
it
be
her
great
caution
in
do
so
which
occasion
her
to
miss
that
gentleman
,
who
enter
at
the
front
door
of
the
Dragon
just
as
she
emerge
from
the
back
one
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
Mr
Anthony
Chuzzlewit
and
his
son
Jonas
be
economically
quarter
at
the
Half
Moon
and
Seven
Stars
,
which
be
an
obscure
ale
-
house
;
and
by
the
very
next
coach
there
come
post
to
the
scene
of
action
,
so
many
other
affectionate
member
of
the
family
(
who
quarrel
with
each
other
,
inside
and
out
,
all
the
way
down
,
to
the
utter
distraction
of
the
coachman
)
,
that
in
less
than
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
the
scanty
tavern
accommodation
be
at
a
premium
,
and
all
the
private
lodging
in
the
place
,
amount
to
full
four
bed
and
sofa
,
rise
cent
per
cent
in
the
market
.
   
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
thing
come
to
that
pass
that
nearly
the
whole
family
sit
down
before
the
Blue
Dragon
,
and
formally
invest
it
;
and
Martin
Chuzzlewit
be
in
a
state
of
siege
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
resist
bravely
;
refuse
to
receive
all
letter
,
message
,
and
parcel
;
obstinately
decline
to
treat
with
anybody
;
and
hold
out
no
hope
or
promise
of
capitulation
.
 
<EOS>
meantime
the
family
force
be
perpetually
encounter
each
other
in
diver
part
of
the
neighbourhood
;
and
,
as
no
one
branch
of
the
Chuzzlewit
tree
have
ever
be
know
to
agree
with
another
within
the
memory
of
man
,
there
be
such
a
skirmishing
,
and
flouting
,
and
snap
off
of
head
,
in
the
metaphorical
sense
of
that
expression
;
such
a
bandying
of
word
and
calling
of
name
;
such
an
upturning
of
nose
and
wrinkling
of
brow
;
such
a
formal
interment
of
good
feeling
and
violent
resurrection
of
ancient
grievance
;
as
have
never
be
know
in
those
quiet
part
since
the
early
record
of
their
civilized
existence
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
,
in
utter
despair
and
hopelessness
,
some
few
of
the
belligerent
begin
to
speak
to
each
other
in
only
moderate
term
of
mutual
aggravation
;
and
nearly
all
address
themselves
with
a
show
of
tolerable
decency
to
Mr
Pecksniff
,
in
recognition
of
his
high
character
and
influential
position
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
by
little
and
little
,
they
make
common
cause
of
Martin
Chuzzlewit
's
obduracy
,
until
it
be
agree
(
if
such
a
word
can
be
use
in
connection
with
the
Chuzzlewits
)
that
there
should
be
a
general
council
and
conference
hold
at
Mr
Pecksniff
's
house
upon
a
certain
day
at
noon
;
which
all
member
of
the
family
who
have
bring
themselves
within
reach
of
the
summon
,
be
forthwith
bidden
and
invite
,
solemnly
,
to
attend
.
   
<EOS>
if
ever
Mr
Pecksniff
wear
an
apostolic
look
,
he
wear
it
on
this
memorable
day

<EOS>
if
ever
his
unruffled
smile
proclaim
the
word
,
"
I
be
a
messenger
of
peace
!

that
be
its
mission
now

within
himself
all
the
mild
quality
of
the
lamb
with
a
considerable
touch
of
the

come
out

forth
once
more
to
look
for

the
young
freshness

<EOS>
what
word
can

<EOS>
oh

naughty
company
among

<EOS>
but
when
the
company
arrive
!
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
when
Mr
Pecksniff
,

from
his
seat
at
the
table
's
head
,
with
a
daughter
on
either
hand
,
receive
his
guest
in
the
good
parlour
and
motion
them
to
chair
,
with
eye
so
overflow
and
countenance
so
damp
with
gracious
perspiration
,
that
he
may
be
say
to
have
be
in
a
kind
of
moist
meekness
!
 
<EOS>
and
the
company
;
the
jealous
stony
-
hearted
distrustful
company
,
who
be
all
shut
up
in
themselves
,
and
have
no
faith
in
anybody
,
and
would
not
believe
anything
,
and
would
no
more
allow
themselves
to
be
soften
or
lull
asleep
by
the
Pecksniffs
than
if
they
have
be
so
many
hedgehog
or
porcupine
!
   
<EOS>
first
,
there
be
Mr
Spottletoe
,
who
be
so
bald
and
have
such
big
whisker
,
that
he
seem
to
have
stop
his
hair
,
by
the
sudden
application
of
some
powerful
remedy
,
in
the
very
act
of
fall
off
his
head
,
and
to
have
fasten
it
irrevocably
on
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
then
there
be
Mrs
Spottletoe
,
who
be
much
too
slim
for
her
year
,
and
of
a
poetical
constitution
,
be
accustom
to
inform
her
more
intimate
friend
that
the
say
whisker
be
"
the
lodestar
of
her
existence
;
"
and
who
could
now
,
by
reason
of
her
strong
affection
for
her
uncle
Chuzzlewit
,
and
the
shock
it
give
her
to
be
suspect
of
testamentary
design
upon
him
,
do
nothing
but
cry
---
except
moan
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
Anthony
Chuzzlewit
,
and
his
son
Jonas
;
the
face
of
the
old
man
so
sharpen
by
the
wariness
and
cunning
of
his
life
,
that
it
seem
to
cut
him
a
passage
through
the
crowded
room
,
as
he
edge
away
behind
the
remote
chair
;
while
the
son
have
so
well
profit
by
the
precept
and
example
of
the
father
,
that
he
look
a
year
or
two
the
elder
of
the
twain
,
as
they
stand
wink
their
red
eye
,
side
by
side
,
and
whisper
to
each
other
softly
.
 
<EOS>
then
there
be
the
widow
of
a
deceased
brother
of
Mr
Martin
Chuzzlewit
,
who
be
almost
supernaturally
disagreeable
,
and
have
a
dreary
face
and
a
bony
figure
and
a
masculine
voice
,
be
,
in
right
of
these
quality
,
what
be
commonly
call
a
strong
-
minded
woman
;
and
who
,
if
she
could
,
would
have
establish
her
claim
to
the
title
,
and
have
show
herself
,
mentally
speak
,
a
perfect
Samson
,
by
shut
up
her
brother
-
in
-
law
in
a
private
madhouse
,
until
he
prove
his
complete
sanity
by
love
her
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
beside
her
sit
her
spinster
daughter
,
three
in
number
,
and
of
gentlemanly
deportment
,
who
have
so
mortify
themselves
with
tight
stay
,
that
their
temper
be
reduce
to
something
less
than
their
waist
,
and
sharp
lacing
be
express
in
their
very
nose
.
 
<EOS>
then
there
be
a
young
gentleman
,
grandnephew
of
Mr
Martin
Chuzzlewit
,
very
dark
and
very
hairy
,
and
apparently
bear
for
no
particular
purpose
but
to
save
looking
-
glass
the
trouble
of
reflect
more
than
just
the
first
idea
and
sketchy
notion
of
a
face
,
which
have
never
be
carry
out
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
a
solitary
female
cousin
who
be
remarkable
for
nothing
but
be
very
deaf
,
and
live
by
herself
,
and
always
have
the
toothache
.
 
<EOS>
then
there
be
George
Chuzzlewit
,
a
gay
bachelor
cousin
,
who
claim
to
be
young
but
have
be
young
,
and
be
incline
to
corpulency
,
and
rather
overfe
himself
;
to
that
extent
,
indeed
,
that
his
eye
be
strain
in
their
socket
,
as
if
with
constant
surprise
;
and
he
have
such
an
obvious
disposition
to
pimple
,
that
the
bright
spot
on
his
cravat
,
the
rich
pattern
on
his
waistcoat
,
and
even
his
glitter
trinket
,
seem
to
have
break
out
upon
him
,
and
not
to
have
come
into
existence
comfortably
.
 
<EOS>
last
of
all
there
be
present
Mr
Chevy
Slyme
and
his
friend
Tigg
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
worthy
of
remark
,
that
although
each
person
present
dislike
the
other
,
mainly
because
he
or
she
do
belong
to
the
family
,
they
one
and
all
concur
in
hate
Mr
Tigg
because
he

<EOS>
such
be
the
pleasant
little
family
circle

in
Mr

good
parlour
,
agreeably
prepare
to
fall
foul
of
Mr
Pecksniff
or
anybody
else
who
may
venture
to
say
anything
whatever
upon
any
subject

<EOS>
"

"
I

"
remark
Mr
Spottletoe

with
his
whisker
in
a
very
portentous
state

a

<EOS>
I
be
no

to
your
preposterous
desire

from

upon
Mr

who
after
vainly
attempt

down
again

fold
his
arm

shake
his
head
most
wrathfully

and
give
Mrs

to
understand
in
dumb
show

that
that
scoundrel
Pecksniff
may
go
on
for
the
present

but
he
would
cut

and
annihilate
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
not

"
say
Mr

in
resumption
of
his
address
,
"
I
be

not

incident

<EOS>
It
be
good
to
feel
that

here
without

<EOS>
It

good

no

"
   
<EOS>
here
,
the
eld
daughter
of
the
strong
-
minded
woman
rise
a
little
way
from
her
seat
,
and
tremble
violently
from
head
to
foot
,
more
as
it
seem
with
passion
than
timidity
,
express
a
general
hope
that
some
people
WOULD
appear
in
their
own
character
,
if
it
be
only
for
such
a
proceeding
have
the
attraction
of
novelty
to
recommend
it
;
and
that
when
they
(
mean
the
some
people
before
mention
)
talk
about
their
relation
,
they
would
be
careful
to
observe
who
be
present
in
company
at
the
time
;
otherwise
it
may
come
round
to
those
relation
'
ear
,
in
a
way
they
little
expect
;
and
as
to
red
nose
(
she
observe
)
<EOS>
she
have
yet
to
learn
that
a
red
nose
be
any
disgrace
,
inasmuch
as
people
neither
make
nor
colour
their
own
nose
,
but
have
that
feature
provide
for
them
without
be
first
consult
;
though
even
upon
that
branch
of
the
subject
she
have
great
doubt
whether
certain
nose
be
red
than
other
nose
,
or
indeed
half
as
red
as
some
.
 
<EOS>
this
remark
be
receive
with
a
shrill
titter
by
the
two
sister
of
the
speaker
,
Miss
Charity
Pecksniff
beg
with
much
politeness
to
be
inform
whether
any
of
those
very
low
observation
be
level
at
her
;
and
receive
no
more
explanatory
answer
than
be
convey
in
the
adage
<EOS>
"
those
the
cap
fit

let
them
wear

"
immediately
commence
a
somewhat
acrimonious
and
personal
retort
,
wherein
she
be
much
comfort
and
abet
by
her
sister
Mercy
,
who
laugh
at
the
same
with
great
heartiness
;
indeed
far
more
naturally
than
life
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
quite
impossible
that
any
difference
of
opinion
can
take
place
among
woman
without
every
woman
who
be
within
hearing
take
active
part
in
it
,
the
strong
-
minded
lady
and
her
two
daughter
,
and
Mrs
Spottletoe
,
and
the
deaf
cousin
(
who
be
not
at
all
disqualify

join
in
the
dispute
by
reason
of
be
perfectly
unacquainted

,
one
and
all
plunge
into
the
quarrel
directly
.
   
<EOS>
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
be
a
pretty
good
match
for
the
three
Miss
Chuzzlewits

and
all
five
young
lady
have
,
in
the
figurative
language
of
the
day
,
a
great
amount
of
steam
to
dispose
of
,
the
altercation
would
no
doubt
have
be
a
long
one
but
for
the
high
valour
and
prowess
of
the
strong
-
minded
woman
,
who
,
in
right
of
her
reputation
for
power
of
sarcasm
,
do
so
belabour
and
pummel
Mrs
Spottletoe
with
taunting
word
that
the
poor
lady
,
before
the
engagement
be
two
minute
old
,
have
no
refuge
but
in
tear
.
 
<EOS>
these
she
shed
so
plentifully
,
and
so
much
to
the
agitation
and
grief
of
Mr
Spottletoe
,
that
that
gentleman
,
after
hold
his
clenched
fist
close
to
Mr
Pecksniff
's
eye
,
as
if
it
be
some
natural
curiosity
from
the
near
inspection
whereof
he
be
likely
to
derive
high
gratification
and
improvement
,
and
after
offer
(
for
no
particular
reason
that
anybody
could
discover
)
to
kick
Mr
George
Chuzzlewit
for
,
and
in
consideration
of
,
the
trifling
sum
of
sixpence
,
take
his
wife
under
his
arm
and
indignantly
withdraw
.
 
<EOS>
this
diversion
,
by
distract
the
attention
of
the
combatant
,
put
an
end
to
the
strife
,
which
,
after
break
out
afresh
some
twice
or
thrice
in
certain
inconsiderable
spurt
and
dash
,
die
away
in
silence
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
then
that
Mr
Pecksniff
once
more
rise
from
his
chair
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
then
that
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
compose
themselves
to
look
as
if
there
be
no
such
being
---
not
to
say
present
,
but
in
the
whole
compass
of
the
world
---
as
the
three
Miss
Chuzzlewits
;
while
the
three
Miss
Chuzzlewits
become
equally
unconscious
of
the
existence
of
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
to
be
lament
,
"
say
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
a
forgiving
recollection
of
Mr
Spottletoe
's
fist
,
"
that
our
friend
should
have
withdraw
himself
so
very
hastily

though
we
have
cause

mutual
congratulation

Mr

account

new

more
than
once
in

to
detect
a
fanciful
resemblance
to
his
master

<EOS>
not
in
his
outward
person

he
be
a
raw

bone
,
haggard
horse
,
always
on
a
much
short
allowance
of
corn

Mr

;
but
in
his
moral
character
,
wherein
,
say
they
,
he
be
full
of
promise

of
no
performance
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
always
in
a
manner

go
to
go
,
and
never
go

<EOS>
when
at
his
slow
rate
of
travel
he
would
sometimes
lift
up
his
leg
so
high
,
and
display
such
mighty
action
,
that
it
be
difficult
to
believe
he
be
do
less
than
fourteen
mile
an
hour
;
and
he
be
for
ever
so
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
own
speed
,
and
so
little
disconcert
by
opportunity
of
compare
himself
with
the
fast
trotter
,
that
the
illusion
be
the
more
difficult
of
resistance
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
kind
of
animal
who
infuse
into
the
breast
of
stranger
a
lively
sense
of
hope

and
possess
all
those
who
know
him
better
with
a
grim
despair

in

respect

have
these
point

he
may

that
good
man
's
slanderer
only
can
explain
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
a
melancholy
truth
,
and
a
deplorable
instance
of
the
uncharitableness
of
the
world
,
that
they
make
the
comparison
.
   
<EOS>
in
this
horse
,
and
the
hooded
vehicle
,
whatever
its
proper
name
may
be
,
to
which
he
be
usually
harness
---
it
be
more
like
a
gig
with
a
tumour

anything
else
---
<EOS>
all
Mr
Pinch
's
thought
and
wish
centre
,
one
bright
frosty
morning
;
for
with
this
gallant
equipage
he
be
about
to
drive
to
Salisbury
alone
,
there
to
meet
with
the
new
pupil
,
and
thence
to
bring
him
home
in
triumph

<EOS>
blessing
on
thy
simple
heart

Tom
Pinch
<EOS>

how
proudly
dost
thou
button
up
that
scanty
coat
,
call
by
a
sad
misnomer
,
for
these
many
year
,
a
"
great
"
one

and
how
thoroughly
,
as
with
thy
cheerful
voice
thou
pleasantly
adjurest
Sam
the
hostler
"
<EOS>
not
to
let
him
go
yet
,
"
dost
thou
believe
that
quadrupe
desire
to
go
,
and
would
go
if
he
may
!
 
<EOS>
who
could
repress
a
smile
---
of
love
for
thee
,
Tom
Pinch
,
and
not
in
jest
at
thy
expense
,
for
thou
art
poor
enough
already
<EOS>
,
Heaven
know
---
to
think
that
such
a
holiday
as
lie
before
thee
should
awaken
that
quick
flow
and
hurry
of
the
spirit
,
in
which
thou
settest
down
again
,
almost
untasted
,
on
the
kitchen
window
-
sill
,
that
great
white
mug
(
put
by
,
by
thy
own
hand
,
last
night
,
that
breakfast
may
not
hold
thee
late
)
,
and
lay
yonder
crust
upon
the
seat
beside
thee
,
to
be
eat
on
the
road
,
when
thou
art
calm
in
thy
high
rejoicing
!
 
<EOS>
who
,
as
thou
drivest
off
,
a
happy
,
man
,
and
noddest
with
a
grateful
lovingness
to
Pecksniff
in
his
nightcap
at
his
chamber
-
window

would
not
cry
,
"
Heaven
speed
thee
,
Tom

and
send
that
thou
wert
go
off
for
ever
to
some
quiet
home

thou

live
at
peace

sorrow
should
not
touch
thee

<EOS>
what
well
time
for
driving
,
riding
,
walking
,
move
through
the
air
by
any
mean
,
than
a
fresh
,
frosty
morning
,
when
hope
run
cheerily
through
the
vein
with
the
brisk
blood
,
and
tingle
in
the
frame
from
head
to
foot
!
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
glad
commencement
of
a
brace
day
in
early
winter
,
such
as
may
put
the
languid
summer
season
(
speak
of
it
when
it
can
not
be
have
)
to
the
blush
,
and
shame
the
spring
for
be
sometimes
cold
by
half
.
 
<EOS>
the
sheep
-
bell
ring
as
clearly
in
the
vigorous
air
,
as
if
they
feel
its
wholesome
influence
like
live
creature
;
the
tree
,
in
lieu
of
leave
or
blossom
,
shed
upon
the
ground
a
frosty
rime
that
sparkle
as
it
fall
,
and
may
have
be
the
dust
of
diamond
.
 
<EOS>
so
it
be
to
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
from
cottage
chimney
,
smoke
go
stream
up
high
,
high
,
as
if
the
earth
have
lose
its
grossness
,
be
so
fair
,
and
must
not
be
oppress
by
heavy
vapour
.
 
<EOS>
the
crust
of
ice
on
the
else
ripple
brook
be
so
transparent
,
and
so
thin
in
texture
,
that
the
lively
water
may
of
its
own
free
will
have
stop
---
in
Tom
's
glad
mind
<EOS>
it
have
---
to
look
upon
the
lovely
morning
.
 
<EOS>
and
lest
the
sun
should
break
this
charm
too
eagerly
,
there
move
between
him
and
the
ground
,
a
mist
like
that
which
wait
upon
the
moon
on
summer
night
---
the
very
same
to
Tom
---
and
woo
him
to
dissolve
it
gently
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
Pinch
go
on
;
not
fast
,
but
with
a
sense
of
rapid
motion
,
which
do
just
as
well
;
and
as
he
go
,
all
kind
of
thing
occur
to
keep
him
happy
.
 
<EOS>
thus
when
he
come
within
sight
of
the
turnpike
,
and
be
---
oh
a
long
way
off
!
<EOS>
---
he
see
the
tollman
's
wife
,
who
have
that
moment
check
a
waggon
,
run
back
into
the
little
house
again
like
mad
,
to
say
(
she
know
)
that
Mr
Pinch
be
come
up
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
be
right
,
for
when
he
draw
within
hail
of
the
gate
,
forth
rush
the
tollman
's
child
,
shriek
in
tiny
chorus
,
"
Mr
Pinch
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
to
Tom
's
intense
delight
.
 
<EOS>
the
very
tollman
,
though
an
ugly
chap
in
general
,
and
one
whom
folk
be
rather
shy
of
handling
,
come
out
himself
to
take
the
toll
,
and
give
him
rough
good
morning
;
and
that
with
all
this
,
and
a
glimpse
of
the
family
breakfast
on
a
little
round
table
before
the
fire
,
the
crust
Tom
Pinch
have
bring
away
with
him
acquire
as
rich
a
flavour
as
though
it
have
be
cut
from
a
fairy
loaf
.
   
<EOS>
but
there
be
more
than
this
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
only
the
married
people
and
the
child
who
give
Tom
Pinch
a
welcome
as
he
pass
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
no
.
<EOS>
sparkle
eye
and
snowy
breast
come
hurriedly
to
many
an
upper
casement
as
he
clatter
by
,
and
give
him
back
his
greeting
:
not
stint
either
,
but
sevenfold
,
good
measure
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
all
merry
.
<EOS>
They
all
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
and
some
of
the
wickedest
among
them
even
kiss
their
hand
as
Tom
look
back
.
 
<EOS>
for
who
mind
poor
Mr
Pinch
?
<EOS>
there
be
no
harm
in
HIM
.
   
<EOS>
and
now
the
morning
grow
so
fair
,
and
all
thing
be
so
wide
awake
and
gay
,
that
the
sun
seem
to
say
---
Tom
have
no
doubt
he
say
---
"
I
can
not
stand
it
any
longer
;
I
must
have
a
look
,
"
stream
out
in
radiant
majesty
.
 
<EOS>
the
mist
,
too
shy
and
gentle
for
such
lusty
company
,
flee
off
,
quite
scared
,
before
it
;
and
as
it
sweep
away
,
the
hill
and
mound
and
distant
pasture
land
,
teem
with
placid
sheep
and
noisy
crow
,
come
out
as
bright
as
though
they
be
unrolled
bran
new
for
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
in
compliment
to
which
discovery
,
the
brook
stand
still
no
longer
,
but
run
briskly
off
to
bear
the
tiding
to
the
water
-
mill
,
three
mile
away
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
be
jog
along
,
full
of
pleasant
thought
and
cheerful
influence
,
when
he
see
,
upon
the
path
before
him
,
go
in
the
same
direction
with
himself
,
a
traveller
on
foot
,
who
walk
with
a
light
quick
step
,
and
sing
as
he
go
---
for
certain
in
a
very
loud
voice
,
but
not
unmusically
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
young
fellow
,
of
some
five
or
six
-
and
-
twenty
perhaps
,
and
be
dress
in
such
a
free
and
fly
-
away
fashion
,
that
the
long
end
of
his
loose
red
neckcloth
be
stream
out
behind
him
quite
as
often
as
before
;
and
the
bunch
of
bright
winter
berry
in
the
buttonhole
of
his
velveteen
coat
be
as
visible
to
Mr
Pinch
's
rearward
observation
,
as
if
he
have
wear
that
garment
wrong
side
foremost
.
 
<EOS>
He
continue
to
sing
with
so
much
energy
,
that
he
do
not
hear
the
sound
of
wheel
until
it
be
close
behind
him
;
when
he
turn
a
whimsical
face
and
a
very
merry
pair
of
blue
eye
on
Mr
Pinch
,
and
check
himself
directly
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
Mark
?
"
say
Tom
Pinch
,
stop
.
 
<EOS>
"
who
'd
have
think
of
see
you
here
?
 
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
this
be
surprising
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mark
touch
his
hat
,
and
say
,
with
a
very
sudden
decrease
of
vivacity
,
that
he
be
go
to
Salisbury
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
how
spruce
you
be
,
too
!
"
say
Mr
Pinch
,
survey
him
with
great
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
"
really
,
I
do
not
think
you
be
half
such
a
tight
-
make
fellow
,
Mark
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thankee
,
Mr
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
pretty
well
for
that
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
my
fault
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
with
regard
to
be
spruce
,
sir
,
that
be
where
it
be
,
you
see
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
here
he
look
particularly
gloomy
.
   
<EOS>
"
where
what
be
?
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
demand
.
   
<EOS>
"
where
the
aggravation
of
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
any
man
may
be
in
good
spirit
and
good
temper
when
he
be
well
dressed
.
 
<EOS>
there
an't
much
credit
in
that
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
very
ragged
and
very
jolly
,
then
I
should
begin
to
feel
I
have
gain
a
point
,
Mr
Pinch
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
so
you
be
singe
just
now
,
to
bear
up
,
as
it
be
,
against
be
well
dressed
,
eh
,
Mark
?
"
say
Pinch
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
conversation
be
always
equal
to
print

sir

rejoin
Mark
,
with
a
broad
grin
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
well
!
"
cry
Pinch
,
"
you
be
the
strange
young
man
,
Mark
<EOS>
,
I
ever
know
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
think
so
;
but
now
I
be
quite
certain
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
Salisbury
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
get
in
?
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
very
glad
of
your
company
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
young
fellow
make
his
acknowledgment
and
accept
the
offer
;
step
into
the
carriage
directly
,
and
seat
himself
on
the
very
edge
of
the
seat
with
his
body
half
out
of
it
,
to
express
his
be
there
on
sufferance
,
and
by
the
politeness
of
Mr
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
go
along
,
the
conversation
proceed
after
this
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
more
than
half
believe
,
just
now
,
see
you
so
very
smart
,
"
say
Pinch
,
"
that
you
must
be
go
to
be
marry
,
Mark
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
I
have
think
of
that
,
too
,
"
he
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
may
be
some
credit
in
be
jolly
with
a
wife
,
"
specially
if
the
child
have
the
measle
and
that
,
and
be
very
fractious
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
a'most
afraid
to
try
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
my
way
clear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
very
fond
of
anybody
,
perhaps
?
"
say
Pinch
.
   
<EOS>
"
not
particular
,
sir
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
but
the
way
would
be
,
you
know
,
Mark
,
accord
to
your
view
of
thing
,
"
say
Mr
Pinch
,
"
to
marry
somebody
you
do
not
like
,
and
who
be
very
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
it
would
,
sir
;
but
that
may
be
carry
out
a
principle
a
little
too
far
,
might
not
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
perhaps
it
may
,
"
say
Mr
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
at
which
they
both
laugh
gaily
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
you
,
sir
,
"
say
Mark
,
"
you
do
not
half
know
me
,
though
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
there
ever
be
a
man
as
could
come
out
so
strong
under
circumstance
that
would
make
other
man
miserable
,
as
I
could
,
if
I
could
only
get
a
chance
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
get
a
chance
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
my
opinion
that
nobody
never
will
know
half
of
what
be
in
me
,
unless
something
very
unexpected
turn
up
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
see
any
prospect
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
-
go
to
leave
the
Dragon
,
sir

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
go
to
leave
the
Dragon
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Mr
Pinch
,
look
at
him
with
great
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
Mark
,
you
take
my
breath
away
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
"
he
rejoin
,
look
straight
before
him
and
a
long
way
off
,
as
man
do
sometimes
when
they
cogitate
profoundly
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
use
of
my
stopping
at
the
Dragon
?
 
<EOS>
It
an't
at
all
the
sort
of
place
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
leave
London
(
I
be
a
kentish
man
by
birth
,
though
)
,
and
take
that
situation
here
,
I
quite
make
up
my
mind
that
it
be
the
dull
little
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
corner
in
England
,
and
that
there
would
be
some
credit
in
be
jolly
under
such
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
Lord
,
there
be
no
dullness
at
the
Dragon
!
 
<EOS>
skittle
,
cricket
,
quoit
,
nine
-
pin
,
comic
song
,
chorus
,
company
round
the
chimney
corner
every
winter
's
evening
.
 
<EOS>
any
man
could
be
jolly
at
the
Dragon
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
credit
in
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
but
if
common
report
be
true
for
once
,
Mark
,
as
I
think
it
be
,
be
able
to
confirm
it
by
what
I
know
myself
,
"
say
Mr
Pinch
,
"
you
be
the
cause
of
half
this
merriment
,
and
set
it
go
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
there
may
be
something
in
that
,
too

sir

answer
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
that
be
no
consolation
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
well
!
"
say
Mr
Pinch
,
after
a
short
silence
,
his
usually
subdue
tone
be
even
now
more
subdued
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
hardly
think
enough
of
what
you
tell
me

<EOS>
why

what
will
become

Mrs
Lupin

Mark

"
   
<EOS>
Mark
look
more
fixedly
before
him
,
and
further
off
still
,
as
he
answer
that
he
do
not
suppose
it
would
be
much
of
an
object
to
her

<EOS>
there
be
plenty
of
smart
young

would
be
glad
of
the
place

<EOS>
He
know
a
dozen
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
probable
enough

say
Mr

but
I
be
not
at
all
sure

Mrs

I
always

Mr

wild

dissipated
city

he
would
look
in

an
hour

two
to
see
him
take

he
set
forth

purchase
a

when

forth
again

to
wander
round
the
town

regale
himself
with
the
shop
window
;
previously
take
a
long
stare
at
the
bank
,
and
wonder
in
what
direction
underground
the
cavern
may
be
where
they
keep
the
money
;
and
turn
to
look
back
at
one

two
young
man
who
pass
him
,
whom
he
know
to
be
article
to
solicitor
in
the

and
who
have
a
sort
of
fearful
interest
in
his
eye
,
as
jolly
dog
who
know
a
thing
or
two
,
and
keep
it
up
tremendously
.
   
<EOS>
but
the
shop
.
 
<EOS>
first
of
all
there
be
the
jeweller
'
shop
,
with
all
the
treasure
of
the
earth
display
therein
,
and
such
large
silver
watch
hang
up
in
every
pane
of
glass
,
that
if
they
be
anything
but
first
-
rate
goer
it
certainly
be
not
because
the
work
could
decently
complain
of
want
of
room
.
 
<EOS>
in
good
sooth
they
be
big
enough
,
and
perhaps
,
as
the
saying
be
,
ugly
enough
,
to
be
the
most
correct
of
all
mechanical
performer
;
in
Mr
Pinch
's
eye
,
however
they
be
small
than
Geneva
ware
;
and
when
he
see
one
very
bloated
watch
announce
as
a
repeater
,
gift
with
the
uncommon
power
of
strike
every
quarter
of
an
hour
inside
the
pocket
of
its
happy
owner
,
he
almost
wish
that
he
be
rich
enough
to
buy
it
.
   
<EOS>
but
what
be
even
gold
and
silver
,
precious
stone
and
clockwork
,
to
the
bookshop
,
whence
a
pleasant
smell

forth

wide
open

in
the
impossibility
of
turn
over

to
rush
blindly
in

and
buy
it

<EOS>
here
too
be
the
dainty

<EOS>
there
be
another

not
quite
so
bad

first

but
still
a
try
shop

where

alone
in

with

skin
cap
and
fowling

piece

calmly
survey
Philip

and
the
host
of
imitator
round
him
,
and
call
Mr

to
witness
that
he
,
of
all
the
crowd

impress
one
solitary
footprint
on
the
shore
of
boyish
memory
,
whereof
the
tread
of
generation
should
not
stir
the
light
grain
of
sand

there
too
be
the
persian

with

shut
up
for
year
in
cavern

with
the
terrible
little
old

out
of

like

all
gory

in
the
robber

<EOS>
which
matchless
wonder
,
come
fast
on
Mr
Pinch
's
mind
,
do
so
rub
up
and
chafe
that
wonderful
lamp
within
him
,
that
when
he
turn
his
face
towards
the
busy
street
,
a
crowd
of
phantom
wait
on
his
pleasure
,
and
he
live
again
,
with
new
delight
,
the
happy
day
before
the
Pecksniff
era

<EOS>
He
have
less
interest
now
in
the
chemist
'
shop
,
with
their
great
glowing
bottle
(
with
small
repository
of
brightness
in
their
very
stopper
)
;
and
in
their
agreeable
compromise
between
medicine
and
perfumery
,
in
the
shape
of
toothsome
lozenge
and
virgin
honey
.
<EOS>
neither
have
he
the
least
regard
(
but
he
never
have
much
)
for
the
tailor
'
,
where
the
new
metropolitan
waistcoat
pattern
be
hang
up
,
which
by
some
strange
transformation
always
look
amazing
there
,
and
never
appear
at
all
like
the
same
thing
anywhere
else
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
stop
to
read
the
playbill
at
the
theatre
and
survey
the
doorway
with
a
kind
of
awe
,
which
be
not
diminish
when
a
sallow
gentleman
with
long
dark
hair
come
out
,
and
tell
a
boy
to
run
home
to
his
lodging
and
bring
down
his
broadsword
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
stand
root
to
the
spot
on
hear
this
,
and
may
have
stand
there
until
dark
,
but
that
the
old
cathedral
bell
begin
to
ring
for
vesper
service
,
on
which
he
tear
himself
away
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
the
organist
's
assistant
be
a
friend
of
Mr
Pinch
's
,
which
be
a
good
thing
,
for
he
too
be
a
very
quiet
gentle
soul
,
and
have
be
,
like
Tom
,
a
kind
of
old
-
fashioned
boy
at
school
,
though
well
like
by
the
noisy
fellow
too
.
 
<EOS>
as
good
luck
would
have
it
<EOS>
(
Tom
always
say
he
have
great
good
luck
)
<EOS>
the
assistant
chance
that
very
afternoon
to
be
on
duty
by
himself
,
with
no
one
in
the
dusty
organ
loft
<EOS>
but
Tom
;
so
while
he
play
,
Tom
help
him
with
the
stop
;
and
finally
,
the
service
be
just
over
,
Tom
take
the
organ
himself
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
turn
dark
,
and
the
yellow
light
that
stream
in
through
the
ancient
window
in
the
choir
be
mingle
with
a
murky
red
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
grand
tone
resound
through
the
church
,
they
seem
,
to
Tom
,
to
find
an
echo
in
the
depth
of
every
ancient
tomb
,
no
less
than
in
the
deep
mystery
of
his
own
heart

<EOS>
great
thought
and
hope
come
crowd
on
his
mind
as
the
rich
music
roll
upon
the
air
and
yet
among
them
---
something
more
grave
and
solemn
in
their
purpose
,
but
the
same
---
be
all
the
image
of
that
day
,
down
to
its
very
light
recollection
of
childhood
.
 
<EOS>
the
feeling
that
the
sound
awaken
,
in
the
moment
of
their
existence
,
seem
to
include
his
whole
life
and
be
;
and
as
the
surround
reality
of
stone
and
wood
and
glass
grow
dimmer
in
the
darkness
,
these
vision
grow
so
much
the
bright
that
Tom
may
have
forget
the
new
pupil
and
the
expectant
master
,
and
have
sit
there
pour
out
his
grateful
heart
till
midnight
,
but
for
a
very
earthy
old
verger
insist
on
lock
up
the
cathedral
forthwith
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
take
leave
of
his
friend
,
with
many
thank
,
grope
his
way
out
,
as
well
as
he
could
,
into
the
now
lamp
-
light
street
,
and
hurry
off
to
get
his
dinner
.
   
<EOS>
all
the
farmer
be
by
this
time
<EOS>
jog
homeward
,
there
be
nobody
in
the
sanded
parlour
of
the
tavern
where
he
have
leave
the
horse
;
so
he
have
his
little
table
draw
out
close
before
the
fire
,
and
fall
to
work
upon
a
well
-
cook
steak
and
smoke
hot
potato
,
with
a
strong
appreciation
of
their
excellence
,
and
a
very
keen
sense
of
enjoyment
.
 
<EOS>
beside
him
,
too
,
there
stand
a
jug
of
most
stupendous
Wiltshire
beer
;
and
the
effect
of
the
whole
be
so
transcendent
,
that
he
be
oblige
every
now
and
then
to
lay
down
his
knife
and
fork
,
rub
his
hand
,
and
think
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
by
the
time
the
cheese
and
celery
come
,
Mr
Pinch
have
take
a
book
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
could
afford
to
trifle
with
the
viand
;
now
eat
a
little
,
now
drink
a
little
,
now
read
a
little
,
and
now
stop
to
wonder
what
sort
of
a
young
man
the
new
pupil
would
turn
out
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
pass
from
this
latter
theme
and
be
deep
in
his
book
again
,
when
the
door
open
,
and
another
guest
come
in
,
bring
with
him
such
a
quantity
of
cold
air
,
that
he
positively
seem
at
first
to
put
the
fire
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
very
hard
frost
to
-
night
,
sir
,
"
say
the
newcomer
,
courteously
acknowledge
Mr
Pinch
's
withdrawal
of
the
little
table
,
that
he
may
have
place
:
"
do
not
disturb
yourself
,
I
beg
.
"
   
<EOS>
though
he
say
this
with
a
vast
amount
of
consideration
for
Mr
Pinch
's
comfort
,
he
drag
one
of
the
great
leather
-
bottom
chair
to
the
very
centre
of
the
hearth
,
notwithstanding
;
and
sit
down
in
front
of
the
fire
,
with
a
foot
on
each
hob
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
foot
be
quite
numbed
.
 
<EOS>
ah
!
 
<EOS>
bitter
cold
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
be
in
the
air
some
considerable
time
,
I
dare
say
?
"
say
Mr
Pinch
.
   
<EOS>
"
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
outside
a
coach
,
too
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
that
account
for
his
make
the
room
so
cool
,
"
think
Mr
Pinch
.
"
<EOS>
poor
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
how
thoroughly
chill
he
must
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
the
stranger
become
thoughtful
likewise
,
and
sit
for
five
or
ten
minute
look
at
the
fire
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
he
rise
and
divest
himself
of
his
shawl
and
great
-
coat
,
which
(
far
different
from
Mr
Pinch
's
)
be
a
very
warm
and
thick
one
;
but
he
be
not
a
whit
more
conversational
out
of
his
great
-
coat
than
in
it
,
for
he
sit
down
again
in
the
same
place
and
attitude
,
and
lean
back
in
his
chair
,
begin
to
bite
his
nail
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
young
---
one
-
and
-
twenty
,
perhaps
---
and
handsome
;
with
a
keen
dark
eye
,
and
a
quickness
of
look
and
manner
which
make
Tom
sensible
of
a
great
contrast
in
his
own
bearing
,
and
cause
him
to
feel
even
more
shy
than
usual
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
clock
in
the
room
,
which
the
stranger
often
turn
to
look
at
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
make
frequent
reference
to
it
also
;
partly
from
a
nervous
sympathy
with
its
taciturn
companion
;
and
partly
because
the
new
pupil
be
to
inquire
for
him
at
half
after
six
,
and
the
hand
be
get
on
towards
that
hour
.
 
<EOS>
whenever
the
stranger
catch
him
look
at
this
clock
,
a
kind
of
confusion
come
upon
Tom
as
if
he
have
be
find
out
in
something
;
and
it
be
a
perception
of
his
uneasiness
which
cause
the
young
man
to
say
,
perhaps
,
with
a
smile
:
   
"
We
both
appear
to
be
rather
particular
about
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
I
have
an
engagement
to
meet
a
gentleman
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
so
have
I
,
"
say
Mr
Pinch
.
   
<EOS>
"
at
half
-
past
six
,
"
say
the
stranger
.
   
<EOS>
"
at
half
-
past
six
,
"
say
Tom
in
the
very
same
breath
;
whereupon
the
other
look
at
him
with
some
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
,
I
expect
,

remark
Tom
,
timidly
,
"
be
to
inquire
at
that
time
for
a
person
by
the
name
of
Pinch

"
   
<EOS>
"

cry
the
other
,
jump
up
.
 
<EOS>
"

I
be
the
Mr

you
be
to
inquire

<EOS>
Pray
excuse
me
.
<EOS>
how
do
you
do

<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
"

Tom
,
"

<EOS>
I

not

Tom
,
smile
with
an
embarrassed
frankness
peculiarly
his
,
and
which
be
as
plainly
a
confession
of
his
own
imperfection
,
and
an
appeal
to
the
kindness
of
the
person
he
address
,
as
if
he
have
draw
one
up
in
simple
language
and
commit
it
to
paper
:
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
indeed
that
you
turn
out
to
be
the
party
I
expect
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
think
,
but
a
minute
ago
,
that
I
could
wish
him
to
be
like
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
return
Martin
,
shake
hand
with
him
again
;
"
for
I
assure
you
,
I
be
think
there
could
be
no
such
luck
as
Mr
Pinch
's
turn
out
like
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
no

really

say
Tom
,
with
great
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
you
serious

<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
I
be
,
"
reply
his
new
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
and
I
will
get
on
excellently
well
,
I
know
;
which
it
be
no
small
relief
to
me
to
feel
,
for
to
tell
you
the
truth
<EOS>
,
I
be
not
at
all
the
sort
of
fellow
who
could
get
on
with
everybody
,
and
that
be
the
point
on
which
I
have
the
great
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
be
quite
relieved
now
.
<EOS>
---
do
me
the
favour
to
ring
the
bell
,
will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
rise
,
and
comply
with
great
alacrity
---
the
handle
hang
just
over
Martin
's
head
,
as
he
warm
himself
---
and
listen
with
a
smile
face
to
what
his
friend
go
on
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
:
   
"
<EOS>
if
you
like
punch
,
you
will
allow
me
to
order
a
glass
<EOS>
apiece
,
as
hot
as
it
can
be
make
,
that
we
may
usher
in
our
friendship
in
a
become
manner
.
 
<EOS>
to
let
you
into
a
secret
,
Mr
Pinch
,
I
never
be
so
much
in
want
of
something
warm
and
cheer
in
my
life
;
but
I
do
not
like
to
run
the
chance
of
be
find
drink
it
,
without
know
what
kind
of
person
you
be
;
for
first
impression
,
you
know
,
often
go
a
long
way
,
and
last
a
long
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
assent
,
and
the
punch
be
order
.
 
<EOS>
in
due
course
it
come
;
hot
and
strong
.
 
<EOS>
after
drink
to
each
other
in
the
steam
mixture
,
they
become
quite
confidential
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
a
sort
of
relation
of
Pecksniff
's
,
you
know
,
"
say
the
young
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
"
cry
Mr
Pinch
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
 
<EOS>
My
grandfather
be
his
cousin
,
so
he
be
kith
and
kin
to
me
,
somehow
,
if
you
can
make
that
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
then
Martin
be
your
christian
name
?
"
say
Mr
Pinch
,
thoughtfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
of
course
it
be
,
"
return
his
friend
:
"
<EOS>
I
wish
it
be
my
surname
for
my
own
<EOS>
be
not
a
very
pretty
one
,
and
it
take
a
long
time
to
sign
Chuzzlewit
<EOS>
be
my
name
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
dear
me
!
"
cry
Mr
Pinch
,
with
an
involuntary
start
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
surprised
at
my
have
two
name
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
return
the
other
,
set
his
glass
to
his
lip
.
 
<EOS>
"
Most
people
have

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no

"
say
Mr
Pinch
,
"
not
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
oh
dear
<EOS>
no
!
 
<EOS>
well
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
then
remember
that
Mr
Pecksniff
have
privately
caution
him
to
say
nothing
in
reference
to
the
old
gentleman
of
the
same
name
who
have
lodge
at
the
Dragon
,
but
to
reserve
all
mention
of
that
person
for
him
,
he
have
no
well
mean
of
hide
his
confusion
than
by
raise
his
own
glass
to
his
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
They
look
at
each
other
out
of
their
respective
tumbler
for
a
few
second
,
and
then
put
them
down
empty
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
them
in
the
stable
to
be
ready
for
us
ten
minute
ago
,
"
say
Mr
Pinch
,
glance
at
the
clock
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
go
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
if
you
please
,
"
return
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
Would
you
like
to
drive
?
"
say
Mr
Pinch
;
his
whole
face
beam
with
a
consciousness
of
the
splendour
of
his
offer
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
,
if
you
wish
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
why
,
that
depend
,
Mr
Pinch
,
"
say
Martin
,
laugh
,
"
upon
what
sort
of
a
horse
you
have
.
 
<EOS>
because
if
he
be
a
bad
one
,
I
would
rather
keep
my
hand
warm
by
hold
them
comfortably
in
my
greatcoat
pocket
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
appear
to
think
this
such
a
good
joke
,
that
Mr
Pinch
be
quite
sure
it
must
be
a
capital
one
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
he
laugh
too
,
and
be
fully
persuade
that
he
enjoy
it
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
settle
his
bill
,
and
Mr
Chuzzlewit
pay
for
the
punch
;
and
have
wrap
themselves
up
,
to
the
extent
of
their
respective
mean
,
they
go
out
together
to
the
front
door
,
where
Mr
Pecksniff
's
property
stop
the
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
drive
,
thank
you
,
Mr
Pinch
,
"
say
Martin
,
get
into
the
sitter
's
place
.
 
<EOS>
"
by
the
bye
,
there
be
a
box
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
Can
we
manage
to
take
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
certainly
,
"
say
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
put
it
in
,
Dick
,
anywhere
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
precisely
of
that
convenient
size
which
would
admit
of
its
be
squeeze
into
any
odd
corner
,
but
Dick
the
hostler
get
it
in
somehow
,
and
Mr
Chuzzlewit
help
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
all
on
Mr
Pinch
's
side
,
and
Mr
Chuzzlewit
say
he
be
very
much
afraid
it
would
encumber
him
;
to
which
Tom
say
,
"
not
at
all
;
"
though
it
force
him
into
such
an
awkward
position
,
that
he
have
much
ado
to
see
anything
but
his
own
knee
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
an
ill
wind
that
blow
nobody
any
good
;
and
the
wisdom
of
the
saying
be
verify
in
this
instance
;
for
the
cold
air
come
from
Mr
Pinch
's
side
of
the
carriage
,
and
by
interpose
a
perfect
wall
of
box
and
man
between
it
and
the
new
pupil
,
he
shield
that
young
gentleman
effectually
;
which
be
a
great
comfort
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
clear
evening
,
with
a
bright
moon
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
landscape
be
silver
by
its
light
and
by
the
hoar
-
frost
;
and
everything
look
exquisitely
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
,
the
great
serenity
and
peace
through
which
they
travel
,
dispose
them
both
to
silence
;
but
in
a
very
short
time
the
punch
within
them
and
the
healthful
air
without
,
make
them
loquacious
,
and
they
talk
incessantly
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
be
halfway
home
,
and
stop
to
give
the
horse
some
water
,
Martin
(
who
be
very
generous
with
his
money
)
order
another
glass
of
punch
,
which
they
drink
between
them
,
and
which
have
not
the
effect
of
make
them
less
conversational
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
Their
principal
topic
of
discourse
be
naturally
Mr
Pecksniff
and
his
family
;
of
whom
,
and
of
the
great
obligation
they
have
heap
upon
him
,
Tom
Pinch
,
with
the
tear
stand
in
his
eye
,
draw
such
a
picture
as
would
have
incline
any
one
of
common
feeling
almost
to
revere
them
;
and
of
which
Mr
Pecksniff
have
not
the
slight
foresight
or
preconceive
idea
,
or
he
certainly
(
be
very
humble
)
would
not
have
send
Tom
Pinch
to
bring
the
pupil
home
.
   
<EOS>
in
this
way
they
go
on
,
and
on
,
and
on
---
in
the
language
of
the
story
-
book
---
until
at
last
the
village
light
appear
before
them
,
and
the
church
spire
cast
a
long
reflection
on
the
graveyard
grass
;
as
if
it
be
a
dial
(
alas

the
true
in
the
world

whatever

I

pass
some
of

I
know

It
lead

something

yes
I
shall

what

my
seeing

in

one
of

lovely

most
beautiful
face
you

I
be
able
to

a

should
be

<EOS>

She
come

lay
his

for
the
first
time
very
early
in
the
morning

when
it
be
hardly
light

when
I
see
her
,
over
my

stand
just
within
the
porch

I
turn
quite
cold

almost
believe
her
to
be
a
spirit

<EOS>
a
moment
's
reflection
get
the
well
of
that

of

soon

off
play

<EOS>
"
why
fortunately
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
?
 
<EOS>
because

stand
there

listen

I
have
my
spectacle
on
,

see
her
through
the
chink
in
the
curtain
as
plainly
as
I
see
you
;

she
be
beautiful

<EOS>
after
a
while

glide
off

out

you
do

<EOS>
"
do
not
you

Tom

do
she
?

certainly
she
do

next

always

there
be
no

about

alone

I
rise
earlier

there
later

she
may
find

open

play

may
not

disappoint

She
stroll
that
way
for

always
stay
to
listen

she
be
go
now

of

unlikely

it

the

You

to

give

pleasure

I
would
have

<EOS>
the

Mr

weakness

would
probably
have
tell
him
so
,
and
give
him
some
good
advice

for
their
opportune
arrival
at
Mr

start

after
deliver
the
animal

clearly

with
a
black
lead

pencil
in

,
and
a
pair
of
compass
in
his
hand
,
at
a
vast
number
of
mathematical
diagram
,
of
such
extraordinary
shape
that
they
look
like
design
for
firework
.
 
<EOS>
neither
have
Miss
Charity
expect

be
busy

with
a

impracticable
nightcap
for

neither

the
petticoat

It

true

may
be
state
in
corroboration
of
Mr

,
that
any
pupil
have
the

that

<EOS>
here
a
great
change
have
take
place
;
for
festive
preparation
on
a
rather
extensive
scale
be
already
complete
,
and
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
be
await
their
return
with
hospitable
look
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
two
bottle
of
currant
wine

white
and
red
;
a
dish
of
sandwich
(
very
long
and
very
slim
)
;
another
of
apple
;
another
of
captain
's
biscuit
(
which
be
always
a
moist
and
jovial
sort
of
viand
)
;
a
plate
of
orange
cut
up
small
and
gritty
;
with
powdered
sugar
,
and
a
highly
geological
home
-
make
cake
.
 
<EOS>
the
magnitude
of
these
preparation
quite
take
away
Tom
Pinch
's
breath
;
for
though
the
new
pupil
be
usually
let
down
softly
,
as
one
may
say
,
particularly
in
the
wine
department
,
which
have
so
many
stage
of
declension
,
that
sometimes
a
young
gentleman
be
a
whole
fortnight
in
get
to
the
pump
;
still
this
be
a
banquet
;
a
sort
of
Lord
Mayor
's
feast
in
private
life
;
a
something
to
think
of
,
and
hold
on
by
,
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
to
this
entertainment
,
which
apart
from
its
own
intrinsic
merit
,
have
the
additional
choice
quality
,
that
it
be
in
strict
keep
with
the
night
,
be
both
light
and
cool
<EOS>
,
Mr
Pecksniff
beseech
the
company
to
do
full
justice
.

"
Martin

seat
himself

my

my

<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
,
if
you
spare
the
bottle
we
shall
quarrel
.
"
   
<EOS>
and
try
(
in
his
regard
for
the
feeling
of
the
rest
)
to
look
as
if
the
wine
be
not
acid
and
do
not
make
him
wink
,
Mr
Pecksniff
do
honour
to
his
own
toast
.
   
<EOS>
"
this
,
"
he
say
,
in
allusion
to
the
party
,
not
the
wine
,
"
be
a
mingling
that
repay
one
for
much
disappointment
and
vexation
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
be
merry

"
 
<EOS>
here
he
take
a
captain

biscuit

<EOS>
"
It
be
a
poor
heart
that
never
rejoice
;
and
our
heart
be
not
poor
.
 
<EOS>
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
with
such
stimulant
to
merriment
do
he
beguile
the
time
,
and
do
the
honour
of
the
table
;
while
Mr
Pinch
,
perhaps
to
assure
himself
that
what
he
see
and
hear
be
holiday
reality
,
and
not
a
charming
dream
,
eat
of
everything
,
and
in
particular
disposed
of
the
slim
sandwich
to
a
surprising
extent
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
he
stint
in
his
draught
of
wine
;
but
on
the
contrary
,
remember
Mr
Pecksniff
's
speech
,
attack
the
bottle
with
such
vigour
,
that
every
time
he
fill
his
glass
anew
,
Miss
Charity
,
despite
her
amiable
resolve
,
could
not
repress
a
fix
and
stony
glare
,
as
if
her
eye
have
rest
on
a
ghost
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
also
become
thoughtful
at
those
moment
,
not
to
say
dejected
;
but
as
he
know
the
vintage
,
it
be
very
likely
he
may
have
be
speculate
on
the
probable
condition
of
Mr
Pinch
upon
the
morrow
,
and
discuss
within
himself
the
good
remedy
for
colic
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
and
the
young
lady
be
excellent
friend
already
,
and
compare
recollection
of
their
childish
day
,
to
their
mutual
liveliness
and
entertainment
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mercy
laugh
immensely
at
everything
that
be
say
;
and
sometimes
,
after
glance
at
the
happy
face
of
Mr
Pinch
,
be
seize
with
such
fit
of
mirth
as
bring
her
to
the
very
confine
of
hysteric
.
 
<EOS>
but
for
these
burst
of
gaiety
,
her
sister
,
in
her
well
sense
,
reprove
her
;
observe
,
in
an
angry
whisper
,
that
it
be
far
from
be
a
theme
for
jest
;
and
that
she
have
no
patience
with
the
creature
;
though
it
generally
end
in
her
laugh
too
---
but
much
more
moderately
---
and
say
that
indeed
it
be
a
little
too
ridiculous
and
intolerable
to
be
serious
about
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
it
become
high
time
to
remember
the
first
clause
of
that
great
discovery
make
by
the
ancient
philosopher

for
secure
health

rich

wisdom
;
the

the
enormous
fortune

amass
by
chimney

sweeper
and
other
person
who
get
up
early
and
go
to

<EOS>
the
young
lady
accordingly
rise
,
and
have
take
leave
of
Mr
Chuzzlewit
with
much
sweetness

father
with
much
duty
and
of
Mr

Mr
Pecksniff

Pecksniffian

the
confidence

of
the
new

<EOS>
It
be
morning
;
and
the
beautiful
Aurora
,
of
whom
so
much
hath
be
write
,
say
,
and
sung
,
do
,
with
her
rosy
finger
,
nip
and
tweak
Miss
Pecksniff
's
nose
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
frolicsome
custom
of
the
Goddess
,
in
her
intercourse
with
the
fair
Cherry
,
so
to
do
;
or
in
more
prosaic
phrase
,
the
tip
of
that
feature
in
the
sweet
girl
's
countenance
be
always
very
red
at
breakfast
-
time
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
most
part
,
indeed
,
it
wear
,
at
that
season
of
the
day
,
a
scraped
and
frosty
look
,
as
if
it
have
be
rasp
;
while
a
similar
phenomenon
develop
itself
in
her
humour
,
which
be
then
observe
to
be
of
a
sharp
and
acid
quality
,
as
though
an
extra
lemon
(
figuratively
speak
)
have
be
squeeze
into
the
nectar
of
her
disposition
,
and
have
rather
damage
its
flavour
.
   
<EOS>
this
additional
pungency
on
the
part
of
the
fair
young
creature
lead
,
on
ordinary
occasion
,
to
such
slight
consequence
as
the
copious
dilution
of
Mr
Pinch
's
tea
,
or
to
his
come
off
uncommonly
short
in
respect
of
butter
,
or
to
other
the
like
result
.
 
<EOS>
but
on
the
morning
after
the
Installation
Banquet
,
she
suffer
him
to
wander
to
and
fro
among
the
eatable
and
drinkable
,
a
perfectly
free
and
unchecked
man
;
so
utterly
to
Mr
Pinch
's
wonder
and
confusion
,
that
like
the
wretched
captive
who
recover
his
liberty
in
his
old
age
,
he
could
make
but
<EOS>
little
use
of
his
enlargement
,
and
fall
into
a
strange
kind
of
flutter
for
want
of
some
kind
hand
to
scrape
his
bread
,
and
cut
him
off
in
the
article
of
sugar
with
a
lump
,
and
pay
him
those
other
little
attention
to
which
he
be
accustom
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
almost
awful
,
too
,
about
the
self
-
possession
of
the
new
pupil
;
who
"
trouble
"
Mr
Pecksniff
for
the
loaf
,
and
help
himself
to
a
rasher
of
that
gentleman
's
own
particular
and
private
bacon
,
with
all
the
coolness
in
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
even
seem
to
think
that
he
be
do
quite
a
regular
thing
,
and
to
expect
that
Mr
Pinch
would
follow
his
example
,
since
he
take
occasion
to
observe
of
that
young
man
"
that
he
do
not
get
on
"
;
a
speech
of
so
tremendous
a
character
,
that
Tom
cast
down
his
eye
involuntarily
,
and
feel
as
if
he
himself
have
commit
some
horrible
deed
and
heinous
breach
of
Mr
Pecksniff
's
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
agony
of
have
such
an
indiscreet
remark
address
to
him
before
the
assemble
family
,
be
breakfast
enough
in
itself
,
and
would
,
without
any
other
matter
of
reflection
,
have
settle
Mr
Pinch
's
business
and
quench
his
appetite
,
for
one
meal
,
though
he
have
be
never
so
hungry
.
   
<EOS>
the
young
lady
,
however
,
and
Mr
Pecksniff
likewise
,
remain
in
the
very
good
of
spirit
in
spite
of
these
severe
trial
,
though
with
something
of
a
mysterious
understanding
among
themselves

<EOS>
when
the
meal
be
nearly
over

Mr
Pecksniff
smilingly
explain
the
cause

their
common
satisfaction

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ardent
child
!
"
say
Mr
Pecksniff
,
gaze
on
her
in
a
dreamy
way
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
yet
there
be
a
melancholy
sweetness
in
these
youthful
hope
!
<EOS>
It
be
pleasant
to
know
that
they
never
can
be
realise
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
think
once
myself
,
in
the
day
of
my
childhood
,
that
pickle
onion
grow
on
tree
,
and
that
every
elephant
be
bear
with
an
impregnable
castle
on
his
back
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
find
the
fact
to
be
so
;
far
from
it
;
and
yet
those
vision
have
comfort
me
under
circumstance
of
trial
.
 
<EOS>
even
when
I
have
have
the
anguish
of
discover
that
I
have
nourish
in
my
breast
on
ostrich
,
and
not
a
human
pupil
---
even
in
that
hour
of
agony
,
they
have
soothe
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
at
this
dread
allusion
to
John
Westlock
,
Mr
Pinch
precipitately
choke
in
his
tea
;
for
he
have
<EOS>
that
very
morning
receive
a
letter
from
him
,
as
Mr
Pecksniff
very
well
know
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
take
care
,
my
dear
Martin
,
"
say
Mr
Pecksniff
,
resume
his
former
cheerfulness
,
"
that
the
house
do
not
run
away
in
our
absence
.
 
<EOS>
We
leave
you
in
charge
of
everything
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
mystery
;
all
be
free
and
open
.
 
<EOS>
unlike
the
young
man
in
the
eastern
tale
---
who
be
describe
as
a
one
-
eyed
almanac
,
if
I
be
not
mistaken
,
Mr
Pinch
?
---
"
   
"
a
one
-
eyed
calender
,
I
think
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
falter
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
be
pretty
nearly
the
same
thing
,
I
believe
,
"
say
Mr
Pecksniff
,
smile
compassionately
;
"
or
they
use
to
be
in
my
time
.
<EOS>
unlike
that
young
man
,
my
dear
Martin
,
you
be
forbid
to
enter
no
corner
of
this
house
;
but
be
request
to
make
yourself
perfectly
at
home
in
every
part
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
be
jovial
,
my
dear
Martin
,
and
will
kill
the
fatted
calf
if
you
please
!
"
   
<EOS>
there
be
not
the
least
objection
,
doubtless
,
to
the
young
man
's
slaughtering
and
appropriate
to
his
own
use
any
calf
,
fat
or
lean
,
that
he
may
happen
to
find
upon
the
premise
;
but
as
no
such
animal
chance
at
that
time
to
be
graze
on
Mr
Pecksniff
's
estate
,
this
request
must
be
consider
rather
as
a
polite
compliment
that
a
substantial
hospitality
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
finishing
ornament
of
the
conversation
;
for
when
he
have
deliver
it
,
Mr
Pecksniff
rise
and
lead
the
way
to
that
hotbed
of
architectural
genius
,
the
two
-
pair
front
.
   
<EOS>
"
let
me
see
,
"
he
say
,
search
among
the
paper
,
"
how
you
can
best
employ
yourself
,
Martin
,
while
I
be
absent
.
 
<EOS>
suppose
you
be
to
give
me
your
idea
of
a
monument
to
a
Lord
Mayor
of
London
;
or
a
tomb
for
a
sheriff
;
or
your
notion
of
a
cow
-
house
to
be
erect
in
a
nobleman
's
park
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
now
,
"
say
Mr
Pecksniff
,
fold
his
hand
,
and
look
at
his
young
relation
with
an
air
of
pensive
interest
,
"
that
I
should
very
much
like
to
see
your
notion
of
a
cow
-
house
?
"
   
<EOS>
but
Martin
by
no
means
appear
to
relish
this
suggestion
.
   
<EOS>
"
a
pump
,
"
say
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
be
very
chaste
practice
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
find
that
a
lamp
post
be
calculate
to
refine
the
mind
and
give
it
a
classical
tendency
.
 
<EOS>
an
ornamental
turnpike
have
a
remarkable
effect
upon
the
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
say
to
begin
with
an
ornamental
turnpike
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
whatever
Mr
Pecksniff
please
,
"
say
Martin
,
doubtfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
stay
,
"
say
that
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
!
<EOS>
as
you
be
ambitious
,
and
be
a
very
neat
draughtsman
,
you
shall
---
ha
ha
!
<EOS>
---
you
shall
try
your
hand
on
these
proposal
for
a
grammar
-
school
;
regulate
your
plan
,
of
course
,
by
the
print
particular
.
 
<EOS>
upon
my
word
,
now
,
"
say
Mr
Pecksniff
,
merrily
,
"
I
shall
be
very
curious
to
see
what
you
make
of
the
grammar
-
school
.
 
<EOS>
who
know
but
a
young
man
of
your
taste
may
hit
upon
something
,
impracticable
and
unlikely
in
itself
,
but
which
I
could
put
into
shape
?
 
<EOS>
for
it
really
be
,
my
dear
Martin
<EOS>
,
it
really
be
in
the
finish
touch
alone
,
that
great
experience
and
long
study
in
these
matter
tell
.
 
<EOS>
ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
now
it
really
will
be
,
"
continue
Mr
Pecksniff
,
clap
his
young
friend
on
the
back
in
his
droll
humour
,
"
an
amusement
to
me
,
to
see
what
you
make
of
the
grammar
-
school
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
readily
undertake
this
task
,
and
Mr
Pecksniff
forthwith
proceed
to
entrust
him
with
the
material
necessary
for
its
execution
;
dwell
meanwhile
on
the
magical
effect
of
a
few
finish
touch
from
the
hand
of
a
master
;
which
,
indeed
,
as
some
people
say
(
and
these
be
the
old
enemy
again
!
)
be
unquestionably
very
surprising
,
and
almost
miraculous
;
as
there
be
case
on
record
in
which
the
masterly
introduction
of
an
additional
back
window
,
or
a
kitchen
door
,
or
half
-
a
-
dozen
step
,
or
even
a
water
spout
,
have
make
the
design
of
a
pupil
Mr
Pecksniff
's
own
work
,
and
have
bring
substantial
reward
into
that
gentleman
's
pocket
.
<EOS>
but
such
be
the
magic
of
genius
,
which
change
all
it
handle
into
gold
!
   
<EOS>
"
when
your
mind
require
to
be
refresh
by
change
of
occupation
,
"
say
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
Thomas
Pinch
will
instruct
you
in
the
art
of
survey
the
back
garden
,
or
in
ascertain
the
dead
level
of
the
road
between
this
house
and
the
finger
-
post
,
or
in
any
other
practical
and
pleasing
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
cart
-
load
of
loose
brick
,
and
a
score
or
two
of
old
flower
-
pot
,
in
the
back
yard
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
could
pile
them
up
my
dear
Martin
,
into
any
form
which
would
remind
me
on
my
return
say
of
St.
Peter
's
at
Rome
,
or
the
Mosque
of
St.
Sophia
at
Constantinople
,
it
would
be
at
once
improve
to
you
and
agreeable
to
my
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
,
"
say
Mr
Pecksniff
,
in
conclusion
,
"
to
drop
,
for
the
present
,
our
professional
relation
and
advert
to
private
matter
<EOS>
,
I
shall
be
glad
to
talk
with
you
in
my
own
room
,
while
I
pack
up
my
portmanteau
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
attend
him
;
and
they
remain
in
secret
conference
together
for
an
hour
or
more
;
leave
Tom
Pinch
alone
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
young
man
return
,
he
be
very
taciturn
and
dull
,
in
which
state
he
remain
all
day
;
so
that
Tom
,
after
try
him
once
or
twice
with
indifferent
conversation
,
feel
a
delicacy
in
obtrude
himself
upon
his
thought
,
and
say
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
He
would
not
have
have
leisure
to
say
much
,
have
his
new
friend
be
ever
so
loquacious
;
for
first
of
all
Mr
Pecksniff
call
him
down
to
stand
upon
the
top
of
his
portmanteau
and
represent
ancient
statue
there
,
until
such
time
as
it
would
consent
to
be
lock
;
and
then
Miss
Charity
call
him
to
come
and
cord
her
trunk
;
and
then
Miss
Mercy
send
for
him
to
come
and
mend
her
box
;
and
then
he
write
the
full
possible
card
for
all
the
luggage
;
and
then
he
volunteer
to
carry
it
all
downstairs
;
and
after
that
to
see
it
safely
carry
on
a
couple
of
barrow
to
the
old
finger
-
post
at
the
end
of
the
lane
;
and
then
to
mind
it
till
the
coach
come
up
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
his
day
's
work
would
have
be
a
pretty
heavy
one
for
a
porter
,
but
his
thorough
good
-
will
made
nothing
of
it
;
and
as
he
sit
upon
the
luggage
at
last
,
wait
for
the
Pecksniffs
,
escort
by
the
new
pupil
,
to
come
down
the
lane
,
his
heart
be
light
with
the
hope
of
have
pleased
his
benefactor
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
almost
afraid
,
"
say
Tom
,
take
a
letter
from
his
pocket
and
wipe
his
face
,
for
he
be
hot
with
bustling
about
though
it
be
a
cold
day
,
"
that
I
should
not
have
have
time
to
write
it
,
and
that
would
have
be
a
thousand
pity
;
postage
from
such
a
distance
be
a
serious
consideration
,
when
one
be
not
rich
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
be
glad
to
see
my
hand
,
poor
girl
,
and
to
hear
that
Pecksniff
be
as
kind
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
ask
John
Westlock
to
call
and
see
her
,
and
tell
her
all
about
me
by
word
of
mouth
,
but
I
be
afraid
he
may
speak
against
Pecksniff
to
her
,
and
make
her
uneasy
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
they
be
particular
people
where
she
be
,
and
it
may
have
render
her
situation
uncomfortable
if
she
have
have
a
visit
from
a
young
man
like
John
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Ruth
!
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
Pinch
seem
a
little
disposed
to
be
melancholy
for
half
a
minute
or
so
,
but
he
find
comfort
very
soon
,
and
pursue
his
rumination
thus
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
a
nice
man
,
I
do
not
think
,
as
John
use
to
say
(
John
be
a
kind
,
merry
-
hearted
fellow
;
I
wish
he
have
like
Pecksniff
better
)
,
to
be
feel
low
,
on
account
of
the
distance
between
us
,
when
I
ought
to
be
think
,
instead
,
of
my
extraordinary
good
luck
in
have
ever
get
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
be
bear
with
a
silver
spoon
in
my
mouth
,
I
be
sure
,
to
have
ever
come
across
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
and
here
have
I
fall
again
into
my
usual
good
luck
with
the
new
pupil
!
 
<EOS>
such
an
affable
,
generous
,
free
fellow
,
as
he
be
,
I
never
see
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
we
be
companion
directly
!
<EOS>
and
he
a
relation
of
Pecksniff
's
too
,
and
a
clever
,
dash
youth
who
may
cut
his
way
through
the
world
as
if
it
be
a
cheese
!
 
<EOS>
here
he
come
while
the
word
be
on
my
lip
<EOS>
"
say
Tom
;
"
walk
down
the
lane
as
if
the
lane
belong
to
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
in
truth
,
the
new
pupil
,
not
at
all
disconcert
by
the
honour
of
have
Miss
Mercy
Pecksniff
on
his
arm
,
or
by
the
affectionate
adieux
of
that
young
lady
,
approach
as
Mr
Pinch

,
follow
by
Miss
Charity
and
Mr
Pecksniff

as

appear
at
the

moment

Tom
lose
no
time
in
entreat
the
gentleman
last
mention
,
to
undertake
the
delivery
of
his
letter

<EOS>
"

say
Mr
Pecksniff
,

at
the
superscription

He
make
the
promise
with
so
much
condescension
and
patronage
,
that
Tom
feel
he
have
ask
a
great
deal

this

take
it
as

he
laugh
too

rub
his

a
pleasant
journey

quite
brisk

even
when

the
perfect
silence

upon

departure

together
with
the
sharp
air

the
wintry
afternoon

both
at

They
turn
,
as

mutual
consent

move
off

Tom

nothing
worth

yes

peevishly

I

<EOS>
"
why

rejoin

with
great
earnestness
,

that
a

newly
escape
from
this
kennel
of

fresh
to
all
the
delight
of

his

it
to
you

it
natural

"
   
<EOS>
after
a
short
reflection
,
Mr
Pinch
reply
,
in
a
more
subdued
tone
,
that
to
be
sure
it
be
unreasonable
to
expect
any
such
thing
,

that
he
have
no
doubt
Martin
know
best

so

when
he
have
make
this
rejoinder
,
they
fall
into

blank
silence
again

until

the

he
swallow

smack
his

as

fire

Interview
succeed
interview

word

the
upshot

that
I
be
to

renounce

he

some
uncommonly
difficult
conundrum
have
be
propose

which
he
find
it
impossible
to
guess
.

at
length

only
by

me

aloof

some
natural
taste

You
be
quite
right

why

not

much
on

account

return
Martin

as
because
my

have
an
inveterate
dislike
to
him
,
and
after
the
old
man
's
arbitrary
treatment
of
me

I
have
a

My

likely
to

long
one

for
neither

I
shall
not

of
marry
until
I
be

able

do
so

It
would
never
do

myself
into
poverty

it
be
not

hard
upon
her
to
be
oblige
to
yield
to
the
necessity
of
the
case

first

because
she
love
me
very

I

a

may

well

It

long
time

certainly

so
long
,
that
he
may
have
take
a
nap
in
the
interval

it
at

now

there

odd

bring
it
to
an

about
your

surely
I
do

rise
from

himself

It

down

Martin
nod
assent
;

add
,
with
a
restless
impatience
,
that
if
he
have
be
a
few
day
earlier
he
would
have
see
her
;
and
that
now
she
may
be
,
for
anything
he
know
,
hundred
of
mile
away

throw
himself
,
after
a
few
turn
across

chair

a
spoilt
child

Tom
Pinch
's
heart
be
very
tender

and
he
could
not
bear
to
see
the
most
indifferent
person
in
distress
;
still
less
one
who
have
awaken
an
interest
in
him
,
and
who
regard
him
(
either
in
fact
,
or
as
he
suppose
)
with
kindness
,

in
a
spirit
of
lenient
construction

<EOS>
whatever
his
own
thought
have
be
a
few
moment
before
---
and
to
judge
from
his
face
they
must
have
be
pretty
serious
---
he
dismiss
them
instantly
,
and
give
his
young
friend
the
good
counsel
and
comfort
that
occur
to
him

<EOS>
"
all
will
be
well

Tom
,

I
have
no
doubt
;

some
trial
and
adversity
just
now
will
only
serve
to
make
you
more
attach

each
other

well
day

<EOS>
I
have
always
read
that
the
truth
be
so

I
have
a
feeling
within
me

tell
me
how
natural

right

never

with

,
despite

be

what
never
run
smooth

can
hardly

it

it

patience

They

busy

deduct
Mr

abstruse
employment
he
be
much
distract
by
a
habit
his
new
friend
have
of
whistle
aloud
while
he
be
draw
---
when
they
be
not
a
little
startle
by
the
unexpected
obtrusion
into
that
sanctuary
of
genius
,
of
a
human
head
which
,
although
a
shaggy
and
somewhat
alarming
head
in
appearance
,
smile
affably
upon
them
from
the
doorway

in
a
manner
that
be
at
once
waggish
,
conciliatory
,
and
expressive
of
approbation

"
I
be
not
industrious
myself

how

that
quality
in

<EOS>
I
wish
I
may
turn
grey
and
ugly
,
if
it
be
not
in
my
opinion
,
next
to
genius

one
of
the
very
charming
quality
of
the
human
mind

<EOS>
upon
my
soul
,
I
be
grateful
to
my
friend

me
to
the
contemplation
of
such
a
delicious
picture

<EOS>
You

me
of

with
which
he
rap
Tom
twice

thrice
upon

breast

nod
several
time

would
say
that
he
see
they
understand
each

;
that
it
be
unnecessary
to
mention
the
circumstance
before

that

would
take
it

favour

the
amount
into

as
quietly

possible

Mr

however

be
so
very
much
astounded
by
this
(
to
him
)
inexplicable
deportment
,
that
he
at
once
openly
declare
there
must
be
some
mistake
,
and
that
he
have
be
entrust
with
no
commission
whatever
have
any
reference
to
Mr

to
his
friend
,
either
.
<EOS>
Mr
Tigg
receive
this
declaration
with
a
grave
request
that
Mr
Pinch
would
have
the
goodness
to
make
it
again
;
and
on
Tom
's
repeat
it
in
a
still
more
emphatic
and
unmistakable
manner
,
check
it
off
,
sentence
for
sentence
,
by
nod
his
head
solemnly
at
the
end
of
each
.
 
<EOS>
when
it
have
come
to
a
close
for
the
second
time
,
Mr

sit
himself
down
in
a
chair
and
address
the
young
man
as
follow
:
   
<EOS>
"
then
I
tell
you
what
it
be
,
gent
both
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
at
this
present
moment
in
this
very
place
,
a
perfect
constellation
of
talent
and
genius
,
who
be
involve
,
through
what
I
can
not
but
designate
as
the
culpable
negligence
of
my
friend
Pecksniff
,
in
a
situation
as
tremendous
,
perhaps
,
as
the
social
intercourse
of
the
nineteenth
century
will
readily
admit
of
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
actually
at
this
instant
,
at
the
Blue
Dragon
in
this
village
---
an
ale
-
house
,
observe
;
a
common
,
paltry
,
low
-
minded
,
clodhopping
,
pipe
-
smoke
ale
-
house
---
an
individual
,
of
whom
it
may
be
say
,
in
the
language
of
the
Poet
,
that
nobody
but
himself
can
in
any
way
come
up
to
him
;
who
be
detain
there
for
his
bill

<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
 
<EOS>
for
his
bill

<EOS>
I
repeat
it

for
his
bill

<EOS>
now
,
"
say
Mr
Tigg
,
"
we
have
hear
of
Fox
's
Book
of
Martyrs
,
I
believe
,
and
we
have
hear
of
the
Court
of
Requests
,
and
the
Star
Chamber
;
but
I
fear
the
contradiction
of
no
man
alive
or
dead
,
when
I
assert
that
my
friend
Chevy
Slyme
be
hold
in
pawn
for
a
bill
,
beat
any
amount
of
cockfighte
with
which
I
be
acquaint

"
   
<EOS>
Martin
and
Mr
Pinch
look
,
first
at
each
other
,
and
afterwards
at
Mr
Tigg
,
who
with
his
arm
fold
on
his
breast
survey
them
,
<EOS>
half
in
despondency
and
half
in
bitterness
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
not
mistake
me
,
gent
both
,
"
he
say
,
stretch
forth
his
right
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
it
have
be
for
anything
but
a
bill
,
I
could
have
bear
it
,
and
could
still
have
look
upon
mankind
with
some
feeling
of
respect
;
but
when
such
a
man
as
my
friend
Slyme
be
detain
for
a
score
---
a
thing
in
itself
essentially
mean
;
a
low
performance
on
a
slate
,
or
possibly
chalk
upon
the
back
of
a
door
<EOS>
---
I
do
feel
that
there
be
a
screw
of
such
magnitude
loose
somewhere
,
that
the
whole
framework
of
society
be
shake
,
and
the
very
first
principle
of
thing
can
no
longer
be
trust

<EOS>
in
short
,
gent
both
,
"
say
Mr
Tigg
with
a
passionate
flourish
of
his
hand
and
head
,
"
when
a
man
like
Slyme
be
detain
for
such
a
thing
as
a
bill
,
I
reject
the
superstition
of
age
,
and
believe
nothing

<EOS>
I
do
not
even
believe
that
I
don't
believe
,
curse
me
if
I
do

<EOS>
"
I
be
very
sorry
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
,
"
say
Tom
after
a
pause
,
"
but
Mr
Pecksniff
say
nothing
to
me
about
it
,
and
I
could
not
act
without
his
instruction
.
 
<EOS>
Would
not
it
be
well
,
sir
,
if
you
be
to
go
to
 
---
to
wherever
you
come
from

yourself

remit
the
money
to
your
friend

<EOS>
"
how
can
that
be
do
,
when
I
be
detain
also
?
"
say
Mr
Tigg
;

when
moreover
,
owe
to
the
astounding
,
and
I
must
add
,
guilty
negligence
of
my
friend
Pecksniff
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
money
for
coach

hire

<EOS>
Tom
think
of
remind
the
gentleman
(
who
,
no
doubt
,
in
his
agitation
have
forget
it
)
<EOS>
that
there
be
a
post
-
office
in
the
land
;
and
that
possibly
if
he
write
to
some
friend
or
agent
for
a
remittance
it
may
not
be
lose
upon
the
road
;
or
at
all
event
that
the
chance
,
however
desperate
,
be
worth
trust
to
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
his
good
-
nature
presently
suggest
to
him
certain
reason
for
abstain
from
this
hint
,
he
pause
again
,
and
then
ask
:
   
"
do
you
say
,

that
you

in

common

Mr

it
an't
that
as
we
object
to

it

the
way
of
this
chap

<EOS>
nothing

good

all

be
overpay

all

<EOS>
this

aggravation
enough
,
he
say
this
morning
to
me
,
in
his
usual
captivating
way

We

my

<EOS>
"
be
you

"
say
I.
 
"
<EOS>
perhaps
you
would
like
the

get
ready
,
sir

"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
no

my
man
<EOS>

he
say
;
"
you

that

<EOS>
I
will
give
Pecksniff
order
to
see
to
that

<EOS>
in
reply
to
which

the
Dragon
make
answer
,
"
Thankee
,
sir
,
you
be
very
kind
to
honour
us
so
far
,
but
as
we
do
not
know
any
particular
good
of
you
,
and
you
do
not
travel
with
luggage
,
and
Mr
Pecksniff
an't
at
home
(
which
perhaps
you
may
not
happen
to
be
aware
of
,
sir
)
,
we
should
prefer
something
more
satisfactory
;
"
and
that
be
where
the
matter
stand
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
ask
,
"
say
Mr
Tapley
,
point
,
in
conclusion
,
to
Mr
Tigg
,
with
his
hat
,
"
any
lady
or
gentleman
,
possess
ordinary
strength
of
mind
,
to
say
whether
he
be
a
disagreeable

look
chap
or
not
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
let
me
inquire
,
"
say
Martin
,
interpose
between
this
candid
speech
and
the
delivery
of
some
blight
anathema
by
Mr
Tigg
,
"
what
the
amount
of
this
debt
may
be
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
in
point
of
money
,
sir
,
very
little
,
"
answer
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
only
just
turn
of
three
pound
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
an't

that
;
it
be
the

"
   
"
yes
,
yes
,
you
tell
us
so
before
,
"
say
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pinch
,
a
word
with
you

"
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Tom
,
retire
with
him
to
a
corner
of
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
simply
---
I
be
ashamed
to
say
---
that
this
Mr
Slyme
be
a
relation
of
mine
,
of
whom
I
never
hear
anything
pleasant
;
and
that
I
do
not
want
him
here
just
now
,
and
think
he
would
be
cheaply
get
rid
of
,
perhaps
,
for
three
or
four
pound
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
not
enough
money
to
pay
this
bill
,
I
suppose
?
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
shake
his
head
to
an
extent
that
leave
no
doubt
of
his
entire
sincerity
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
unfortunate
,
for
I
be
poor
too
;
and
in
case
you
have
have
it
,
I
would
have
borrow
it
of
you

<EOS>
but
if
we
tell
this
landlady
we
would
see
her
pay

,
I
suppose
that
would
answer
the

purpose
?

"
oh
dear
,
yes
!

say
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
know
me
,
bless
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
then
let
us
go
down
at
once
and
tell
her
so
;
for
the
sooner
we
be
rid
of
their
company
the
well
.
 
<EOS>
as
you
have
conduct
the
conversation
with
this
gentleman
hitherto
,
perhaps
you
will
tell
him
what
we
purpose
do
;
will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
,
comply
,
at
once
impart
the
intelligence
to
Mr
Tigg
,
who
shake
him
warmly
by
the
hand
in
return
,
assure
him
that
his
faith
in
anything
and
everything
be
again

.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
so
much
,
he
say
,
for
the
temporary
relief
of
this
assistance
that
he
prize
it
,
as
for
its
vindication
of
the
high
principle
that
Nature
's
Nobs
feel
with
Nature
's
Nobs
,
and
that
true
greatness
of
soul
sympathize
with
true
greatness
of
soul
,
all
the
world
over
.
<EOS>
It
prove
to
him
,
he
say
,
that
like
him
they
admire
genius
,
even
when
it
be
couple
with
the
alloy
occasionally
visible
in
the
metal
of
his
friend
Slyme
;
and
on
behalf
of
that
friend
,
he
thank
them
;
as
warmly
and
heartily
as
if
the
cause
be
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
be
cut
short
in
these
speech
by
a
general
move
towards
the
stair
,
he
take
possession
at
the
street
door
of
the
lapel
of
Mr
Pinch
's
coat
,
as
a
security
against
further
interruption
;
and
entertain
that
gentleman
with
some
highly
improve
discourse
until
they
reach
the
Dragon
,
whither
they
be
closely
follow
by
Mark
and
the
new
pupil
.
   
<EOS>
the
rosy
hostess
scarcely
need
Mr
Pinch
's
word
as
a
preliminary
to
the
release
of
her
two
visitor
,
of
whom
she
be
glad
to
be
rid
on
any
term
;
indeed
,
their
brief
detention
have
originate
mainly
with
Mr
Tapley
,
who
entertain
a
constitutional
dislike
to
gentleman
out
-
at
-
elbow
who
flourish
on
false
pretence
;
and
have
conceive
a
particular
aversion
to
Mr
Tigg
and
his
friend
,
as
choice
specimen
of
the
specie
.
 
<EOS>
the
business
in
hand
thus
easily
settle
,
Mr
Pinch
and
Martin
would
have
withdraw
immediately
,
but
for
the
urgent
entreaty
of
Mr
Tigg
that
they
would
allow
him
the
honour
of
present
them
to
his
friend
Slyme
,
which
be
so
very
difficult
of
resistance
that
,
yield
partly
to
these
persuasion
and
partly
to
their
own
curiosity
,
they
suffer
themselves
to
be
usher
into
the
presence
of
that
distinguished
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
He

the
top
of
the

with
the
wet

of
his
drinking

<EOS>
wretched
and
forlorn
as
he
look
,
Mr
Slyme
have
once
be
in
his
way
,
the
choicest
of
swaggerer
;
put
forth
his
pretension
boldly
,
as
a
man
of
infinite
taste
and
most
undoubted
promise
.
 
<EOS>
the
stock
-
in

trade
requisite
to
set
up
an
amateur
in
this
department
of
business
be
very
slight
,
and
easily
get
together
;
a
trick
of
the
nose
and
a
curl
of
the
lip
sufficient
to
compound
a
tolerable
sneer
,
be
ample
provision
for
any
exigency

in
an
evil
hour

shoot
of
the
chuzzlewit
trunk

be
lazy

and
ill
qualified
for
any
regular
pursuit
and
have
dissipate
such
mean
as
he
ever
possess
,
have
formally
establish
himself
as
a
professor
of
Taste
for
a
livelihood
;
and
find
,
too
late
,
that
something
more
than
his
old
amount
of
qualification
be
necessary
to
sustain
him
in
this
calling

<EOS>
have
quickly
fall
to
his
present
level
,
where
he
retain
nothing
of
his
old
self
but
his
boastfulness
and
his
bile
,
and
seem
to
have
no
existence
separate
or
apart
from
his
friend
Tigg

and
now
so
abject

so
pitiful

be
he

at
once
so
maudlin

insolent

beggarly

proud

enough
to
be
work

by
any
catspaw

would
serve
his

too
insolent

him

cur
enough

one
minute
of
your

Mr

add
this
condition
to

read
the

that

append

,
after
squeeze
his

great
fervour

depart

<EOS>
Tom
entertain
enough
suspicion
that
Martin
may
possibly
turn
this
interview
into
a
jest
,
to
render
him
desirous
to
avoid
the
company
of
that
young
gentleman
for
the
present
.
 
<EOS>
with
this
view
he
take
a
few
turn
up
and
down
the
skittle

ground
,

do
not
re

enter
the
house

if

I
may
do
myself
justice

but
the
difficulty
be
to
make
sure
of
one

ground

because
a
young
man
can
not
very
well
advertise

he
want

much
an
object

out

would
open
a
field

the

take
ill

You

as

such
further
particular
of
Mark

whimsical
restlessness

the
reader
be
already
acquaint

<EOS>
in
the
meantime
Mark
,
have
a
shrewd
notion
that
his
mistress
be
in
very
low
spirit

that
he
could
not
exactly
answer
for
the
consequence
of
any
lengthen
TETE

A

TETE
in
the
bar

keep
himself
obstinately
out

in

piece

at
length

there

now
no

Mark
put
the
good
face
he
could

the
matter

doggedly
to
the
bar

<EOS>
"
if
I

You

so
I
be

pursue

it
really
be
not
an
unnatural
inquiry

"
why
do
you
desert
it
?

<EOS>
but
as
he
give
no
manner
of
answer
to
this
question
;
not
even
on
its
be
repeat
;
Mrs
Lupin
put
his
money
into
his
hand
,
and
ask
him
---
not
unkindly
,
quite
the
contrary
---
what
he
would
take
?
   
<EOS>
It
be
proverbial
that
there
be
certain
thing

not

such
a
question
as
this

propound

such
a
manner

(
at

He
look
up

throw
off
all
his

in
an

seize
the

round
the
waist

cry
Mr

shake
his
head
expressively
enough
,
and
look
(
in
a
momentary
state
of
forgetfulness
)
rather
hard
at
the
hostess

ripe
lip

the
merry
possible
surprise

I

for

when

"
for

(
he
observe

,
"
if
every

warm

we

lose
the
satisfaction

the
fortitude

certain
condition

bear

understanding

even
before
your

<EOS>
now
I

when
I
have
a
business
scheme
in

tell
Jonas
what
it

oh

you
have
better
ask

Jonas

<EOS>
"
I
be
not

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
be
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
greatly
entertain
by
this
retort
.
 
<EOS>
His
mirth
have
subside
,
Mr
Jonas
give
him
to
understand
that
himself
and
parent
be
in
fact
travel
to
their
home
in
the
metropolis
;
and
that
,
since
the
memorable
day
of
the
great
family
gathering
,
they
have
be
tarry
in
that
part
of
the
country
,
watch
the
sale
of
certain
eligible
investment
,
which
they
have
have
in
their
copartnership
eye
when
they
come
down
;
for
it
be
their
custom
,
Mr
Jonas
say
,
whenever
such
a
thing
be
practicable
,
to
kill
two
bird
with
one
stone
,
and
never
to
throw
away
sprat
,
but
as
bait
for
whale
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
communicate
to
Mr
Pecksniff
these
pithy
scrap
of
intelligence
,
he
say
,
"
that
if
it
be
all
the
same
to
him
,
he
would
turn
him
over
to
father
,
and
have
a
chat
with
the
gal
;
"
and
in
furtherance
of
this
polite
scheme
,
he
vacate
his
seat
adjoin
that
gentleman
,
and
establish
himself
in
the
opposite
corner
,
next
to
the
fair
Miss
Mercy
.
   
<EOS>
the
education
of
Mr
Jonas
have
be
conduct
from
his
cradle
on
the
strict
principle
of
the
main
chance
.
 
<EOS>
the
very
first
word
he
learn
to
spell
be
"
gain
,
"
and
the
second
(
when
he
get
into
two
syllable
)
,
"
money
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
for
two
result
,
which
be
not
clearly
foresee
perhaps
by
his
watchful
parent
in
the
beginning
,
his
training
may
be
say
to
have
be
unexceptionable
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
these
flaw
be
,
that
have
be
long
teach
by
his
father
to
over
-
reach
everybody
,
he
have
imperceptibly
acquire
a
love
of
over
-
reach
that
venerable
monitor
himself
.
 
<EOS>
the
other
,
that
from
his
early
habit
of
consider
everything
as
a
question
of
property
,
he
have
gradually
come
to
look
,
with
impatience
,
on
his
parent
as
a
certain
amount
of
personal
estate
,
which
have
no
right
whatever
to
be
go
at
large
,
but
ought
to
be
secure
in
that
particular
description
of
iron
safe
which
be
commonly
call
a
coffin
,
and
bank
in
the
grave

she

sober
down

<EOS>
"
It
will
be

long

rejoin
her

<EOS>
"
take
a
little
more
room

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
of
crowd
you
,
"
say
Charity
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
take
it
notwithstanding
;
and
after
one
or
two
remark
on
the
extreme
heaviness
of
the
coach
,
and
the
number
of
place
it
stop
at
,
they
fall
into
a
silence
which
remain
unbroken
by
any
member
of
the
party
until
supper
-
time
.
   
<EOS>
although
Mr
Jonas
conduct
Charity
to
the
hotel
and
sit
himself
beside
her
at
the
board
,
it
be
pretty
clear
that
he
have
an
eye
to
"
the
other
one
"
also
,
for
he
often
glance
across
at
mercy
,
and
seem
to
draw
comparison
between
the
personal
appearance
of
the
two
,
which
be
not
unfavourable
to
the
superior
plumpness
of
the
young
sister
.
 
<EOS>
He
allow
himself
no
great
leisure
for
this
kind
of
observation
,
however
,
be
busily
engage
with
the
supper
,
which
,
as
he
whisper
in
his
fair
companion
's
ear
,
be
a
contract
business
,
and
therefore
the
more
she
eat
,
the
well
the
bargain
be
.
 
<EOS>
His
father
and
Mr
Pecksniff
,
probably
act
on
the
same
wise
principle
,
demolish
everything
that
come
within
their
reach
,
and
by
that
mean
acquire
a
greasy
expression
of
countenance
,
indicate
contentment
,
if
not
repletion
,
which
it
be
very
pleasant
to
contemplate
.
   
<EOS>
when
they
could
eat
no
more
,
Mr
Pecksniff
and
Mr
Jonas
subscribe
for
two
sixpenny
-
worth
of
hot
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
which
the
latter
gentleman
consider
a
more
politic
order
than
one
shillingsworth
;
there
be
a
chance
of
their
get
more
spirit
out
of
the
innkeeper
under
this
arrangement
than
if
it
be
all
in
one
glass
.
<EOS>
have
swallow
his
share
of
the
enliven
fluid
,
Mr
Pecksniff
,
under
pretence
of
go
to
see
if
the
coach
be
ready
,
go
secretly
to
the
bar
,
and
have
his
own
little
bottle
fill
,
in
order
that
he
may
refresh
himself
at
leisure
in
the
dark
coach
without
be
observe
.
   
<EOS>
these
arrangement
conclude
,
and
the
coach
be
ready
,
they
get
into
their
old
place
and
jog
on
again
.
 
<EOS>
but
before
he
compose
himself
for
a
nap
,
Mr
Pecksniff
deliver
a
kind
of
grace
after
meat
,
in
these
word
:
   
"
<EOS>
the
process
of
digestion
,
as
I
have
be
inform
by
anatomical
friend
,
be
one
of
the
most
wonderful
work
of
nature
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
it
may
be
with
other
,
but
it
be
a
great
satisfaction
to
me
to
know
,
when
regale
on
my
humble
fare
,
that
I
be
put
in
motion
the
most
beautiful
machinery
with
which
we
have
any
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
I
really
feel
at
such
time
as
if
I
be
do
a
public
service
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
wind
myself
up
,
if
I
may
employ
such
a
term
,
"
say
Mr
Pecksniff
with
exquisite
tenderness
,
"
and
know
that
I
be
go
<EOS>
,
I
feel
that
in
the
lesson
afford
by
the
work
within
me
,
I
be
a
Benefactor
to
my
kind

"
   
<EOS>
as
nothing
could
be
add
to
this
,
nothing
be
say
;
and
Mr
Pecksniff
,
exult
<EOS>
,
it
may
be
presume
,
in
his
moral
utility
,
go
to
sleep
again
.
   
<EOS>
the
rest
of
the
night
wear
away
in
the
usual
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
and
Old
Anthony
keep
tumble
against
each
other
and
wake
up
much
terrified
,
or
crush
their
head
in
opposite
corner
of
the
coach
and
strangely
tattoo
the
surface
of
their
face
---
Heaven
know
how
 
---
in
their
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
the
coach
stop
and
go
on
,
and
go
on
and
stop
,
time
out
of
number
.
 
<EOS>
passenger
get
up
and
passenger
get
down
,
and
fresh
horse
come
and
go
and
come
again
,
with
scarcely
any
interval
between
each
team
as
it
seem
to
those
who
be
doze
,
and
with
a
gap
of
a
whole
night
between
every
one
as
it
seem
to
those
who
be
broad
awake
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
they
begin
to
jolt
and
rumble
over
horribly
uneven
stone
,
and
Mr
Pecksniff
look
out
of
window
say
it
be
to
-
morrow
morning
,
and
they
be
there
.
   
<EOS>
very
soon
afterwards
the
coach
stop
at
the
office
in
the
city
;
and
the
street
in
which
it
be
situate
be
already
in
a
bustle
,
that
fully
bear
out
Mr
Pecksniff
's
word
about
its
be
morning
,
though
for
any
sign
of
day
yet
appear
in
the
sky
it
may
have
be
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
dense
fog
too
;
as
if
it
be
a
city
in
the
cloud
,
which
they
have
be
travel
to
all
night
up
a
magic
beanstalk
;
and
there
be
a
thick
crust
upon
the
pavement
like
oilcake
;
which
,
one
of
the
outside
(
mad
,
no
doubt
)
say
to
another
(
his
keeper
,
of
course
)
,
be
snow
.
   
<EOS>
take
a
confused
leave
of
Anthony
and
his
son
,
and
leave
the
luggage
of
himself
and
daughter
at
the
office
to
be
call
for
afterwards
,
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
one
of
the
young
lady
under
each
arm
,
dive
across
the
street
,
and
then
across
other
street
,
and
so
up
the
queer
court
,
and
down
the
strange
alley
and
under
the
blind
archway
,
in
a
kind
of
frenzy
;
now
skip
over
a
kennel
,
now
run
for
his
life
from
a
coach
and
horse
;
now
think
he
have
lose
his
way
,
now
think
he
have
find
it
;
now
in
a
state
of
the
high
confidence
,
now
despondent
to
the
last
degree
,
but
always
in
a
great
perspiration
and
flurry
;
until
at
length
they
stop
in
a
kind
of
pave
yard
near
the
Monument
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
to
say
,
Mr
Pecksniff
tell
them
so
;
for
as
to
anything
they
could
see
of
the
Monument
,
or
anything
else
but
the
building
close
at
hand
,
they
may
as
well
have
be
play
blindman
's
buff
at
Salisbury
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
look
about
him
for
a
moment
,
and
then
knock
at
the
door
of
a
very
dingy
edifice
,
even
among
the
choice
collection
of
dingy
edifice
at
hand
;
on
the
front
of
which
be
a
little
oval
board
like
a
tea
-
tray
,
with
this
inscription
---
"
<EOS>
Commercial
Boarding
-
House
:
M
Todgers
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
seem
that
M
Todgers
be
not
up
yet
,
for
Mr
Pecksniff
knock
twice
and
rang
thrice
,
without
make
any
impression
on
anything
but
a
dog
over
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
a
chain
and
some
bolt
be
withdraw
with
a
rusty
noise
,
as
if

but
the

be
the
cellarage
<EOS>
,
approachable
only
by
a

a
rusty

which
cellarage
within

<EOS>
the

there

of
terrace

with
post

fragment

rotten

and
after

be
for

choke
from
have
look
perforce
,
straight
down
the
kitchen
chimney
;
but
these
two
stage
over

there
be
thing
to
gaze
at
from
the
top
of
Todgers

,
<EOS>
well
worth
your
seeing
too
.
 
<EOS>
for
first
and
foremost
,
if
the
day
be
bright
,
you
observe
upon
the
house
-
top
,
stretch
far
away
,
a
long
dark
path
;
the
shadow
of
the
Monument
;
and
turn
round
,
the
tall
original
be
close
beside
you
,
with
every
hair
erect
upon
his
golden
head
,
as
if
the
doing
of
the
city
frighten
him
.
 
<EOS>
then
there
be
steeple
,
tower
,
belfry
,
shine
vane
,
and
mast
of
ship
;
a
very
forest
.
 
<EOS>
Gables
,
housetop
,
garret
-
window
,
wilderness
upon
wilderness
.
 
<EOS>
smoke
and
noise
enough
for
all
the
world
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
after
the
first
glance
,
there
be
slight
feature
in
the
midst
of
this
crowd
of
object
,
which
spring
out
from
the
mass
without
any
reason
,
as
it
be
,
and
take
hold
of
the
attention
whether
the
spectator
would
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
the
revolve
chimney
-
pot
on
one
great
stack
of

<EOS>
other

themselves
askew

that
they

baffle
Todgers

<EOS>
the
man
who
be
mend
a
pen
at
an
upper
window
over
the
way
,
become
of
paramount
importance
in
the
scene
,
and
make
a
blank
in
it
,
ridiculously
disproportionate
in
its
extent
,
when
he
retire
.
 
<EOS>
the
gambol
of
a
piece
of
cloth
upon
the
dyer
's
pole
have
far
more
interest
for
the
moment
than
all
the
change
motion
of
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
yet
even
while
the
looker
-
on
feel
angry
with
himself
for
this
,
and
wonder
how
it
be
,
the
tumult
swell
into
a
roar
;
the
host
of
object
seem
to
thicken
and
expand
a
hundredfold
,
and
after
gaze
round
him
,
quite
scared
,
he
turn
into
Todgers
's
again
,
much
more
rapidly
than
he
come
out
;
and
ten
to
one
he
tell
M
Todgers
afterwards
that
if
he
have
not
do
so
,
he
would
certainly
have
come
into
the
street
by
the
short
cut
;
that
be
to
say
,
head
-
foremost
.
   
<EOS>
so
say
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
,
when
they
retire
with
Mrs
Todgers
from
this
place
of
espial
,
leave
the
youthful
porter
to
close
the
door
and
follow
them
downstairs
;
who
,
be
of
a
playful
temperament
,
and
contemplate
with
a
delight
peculiar
to
his
sex
and
time
of
life
,
any
chance
of
dash
himself
into
small
fragment
,
linger
behind
to
walk
upon
the
parapet
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
the
second
day
of
their
stay
in
London
,
the
Miss
Pecksniffs
and
Mrs
Todgers
be
by
this
time
highly
confidential

insomuch
that
the

lady
have
already
communicate
the
particular

three
early
disappointment
of
a
tender
nature

and
have
furthermore
possess
her
young

a
general
summary
of
the
life

conduct
,

character
of
Mr

<EOS>
who
,
it
seem
,
have
cut
his

career
rather
short
,
by
unlawfully
run
away
from

and
establish
himself
in
foreign

They
live
at
Camberwell

in
a
house
so
big

fierce

that
its
mere
outside
,
like
the
outside
of
a
giant

castle
,
strike
terror
into
vulgar
mind
and
make
bold
person
quail

that

himself
among

a
life
of
torment
which

such
a
pitch
of

<EOS>
"

the
footman

<EOS>
He
must
have
be
an
ingenious
young
man
,
for
he
say
it
very
cleverly
;
with
a
nice
discrimination
between
the
cold
respect
with
which
he
would
have
announce
visitor
to
the
family
,
and
the
warm
personal
interest
with
which
he
would
have

visitor
to
the
cook

at

take
mental
note
of
all
that

<EOS>
for
the
lady
of

be
curious
in
the
natural

encourage
her

thereon
whenever

in

very

<EOS>
It
be
a
melancholy
fact
;

it
must
be
relate

that
Mr

not

<EOS>
on
the

mild

prepossessing
face

and
a
pretty
little
figure

slight

short

remarkable
for
its
neatness

<EOS>
there
be
something
of
her

much
of
him
indeed
,
in
a
certain
gentleness

her
look

up
the
good

this
disappointment

and
carry
it
off
,
in
outward
show
at
least
,
with
a
titter
;
but
her
sister

up

<EOS>
then

Miss

with
more
condescension

kindness

for
it
be
desirable
<EOS>
the
footman

expressly

Mr

look
in

pensive
mood
hard
at

as
if

My

be

<EOS>
They
be
not
quite
ready
yet
,
for
they
be
still
caress
the
pupil
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
tear
themselves
away
at
length
;
and
sweeping
past
Miss
Pinch
with
each
a
haughty
inclination
of
the
head
and
a
curtsey
strangle
in
its
birth
,
flounce
into
the
passage
.
   
<EOS>
the
young
man
have
rather
a
long
job
in
show
them
out
;
for
Mr
Pecksniff
's
delight
in
the
tastefulness
of
the
house
be
such
that
he
could
not
help
often
stop
(
particularly
when
they
be
near
the
parlour
door
)
and
give
it
expression
,
in
a
loud
voice
and
very
learn
term

indeed

a
familiar
exposition

whole
science

and
be
yet
in
the
freshness
of
his
eloquence
when
they
reach
the
garden

<EOS>
"
if
you
look
,
"
say
Mr
Pecksniff
,
back
from
the
step
,
with
his
head
on
one
side
and
his
eye
half
-
shut
that
he
may
the
well
take
in
the
proportion
of
the
exterior
:
"
if
you
look

my

at

the
airiness
of

"
   
<EOS>
interrupt

word
,
he
very
politely
bow
to
a
middle
-
aged
gentleman
at
an
upper
window
,
to
whom
he
speak
---
not
because
the
gentleman
could
hear
him
(
for
he
certainly
could
not

,
but
as
an
appropriate
accompaniment
to
his
salutation

<EOS>
"
I

repeat

warmly

<EOS>
"
We
be

Mr

<EOS>

<EOS>
You
see
a
gravel
walk
,
do
not
you
?
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
it
be
mean
for
?
 
<EOS>
open
the
gate
there
!
 
<EOS>
show
that
party
out
!
"
   
<EOS>
with
that
he
clap
down
the
window
again
,
and
disappear
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
put
on
his
hat
,
and
walk
with
great
deliberation
and
in
profound
silence
to
the
fly
,
gaze
at
the
cloud
as
he
go
,
with
great
interest
.
 
<EOS>
after
help
his
daughter
and
Mrs
Todgers
into
that
conveyance
,
he
stand
look
at
it
for
some
moment
,
as
if
he
be
not
quite
certain
whether
it
be
a
carriage
or
a
temple
;
but
have
settle
this
point
in
his
mind
,
he
get
into
his
place
,
spread
his
hand
out
on
his
knee
,
and
smile
upon
the
three
beholder
.
   
<EOS>
but
his
daughter
,
less
tranquil
-
minded
,
burst
into
a
torrent
of
indignation
.
 
<EOS>
this
come
,
they
say
,
of
cherish
such
creature
as
the
pinche
.
 
<EOS>
this
come
of
lower
themselves
to
their
level
.
 
<EOS>
this
come
of
put
themselves
in
the
humiliating
position
of
seem
to
know
such
bold
,
audacious
,
cunning
,
dreadful
girl
as
that
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
expect
this
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
predict
it
to
Mrs
Todgers
,
as
she
(
todger
)
could
depone
,
that
very
morning
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
,
they
add
,
that
the
owner
of
the
house
,
suppose
them
to
be
Miss
Pinch
's
friend
,
have
act
,
in
their
opinion
,
quite
correctly
,
and
have
do
no
more
than
,
under
such
circumstance
,
may
reasonably
have
be
expect
.
 
<EOS>
to
that
they
add
(
with
a
trifling
inconsistency
)
,
that
he
be
a
brute
and
a
bear
;
and
then
they
merge
into
a
flood
of
tear
,
which
sweep
away
all
wander
epithet
before
it
.
   
<EOS>
perhaps
Miss
Pinch
be
scarcely
so
much
to
blame
in
the
matter
as
the
Seraph
,
who
,
immediately
on
the
withdrawal
of
the
visitor
,
have
hasten
to
report
them
at
head
-
quarter
,
with
a
full
account
of
their
have
presumptuously
charge
her
with
the
delivery
of
a
message
afterwards
consign
to
the
footman
;
which
outrage
,
take
in
conjunction
with
Mr
Pecksniff
's
unobtrusive
remark
on
the
establishment
,
may
possibly
have
have
some
share
in
their
dismissal
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Miss
Pinch
,
however
,
have
to
bear
the
brunt
of
it
with
both
party
;
be
so
severely
take
to
task
by
the
Seraph
's
mother
for
have
such
vulgar
acquaintance
,
that
she
be
fain
to
retire
to
her
own
room
in
tear
,
which
her
natural
cheerfulness
and
submission
,
and
the
delight
of
have
see
Mr
Pecksniff
,
and
have
receive
a
letter
from
her
brother
,
be
at
first
insufficient
to
repress
.
   
<EOS>
as
to
Mr
Pecksniff
,
he
tell
them
in
the
fly
,
that
a
good
action
be
its
own
reward
;
and
rather
give
them
to
understand
,
that
if
he
could
have
be
kick
in
such
a
cause
,
he
would
have
like
it
all
the
well
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
no
comfort
to
the
young
lady
,
who
scold
violently
the
whole
way
back
,
and
even
exhibit
,
more
than
once
,
a
keen
desire
to
attack
the
devoted
Mrs
Todgers
;
on
whose
personal
appearance
,
but
particularly
on
whose
offending
card
and
hand
-
basket
,
they
be
secretly
inclined
to
lay
the
blame
of
half
their
failure
.
   
<EOS>
Todgers
's
be
in
a
great
bustle
that
evening
,
partly
owe
to
some
additional
domestic
preparation
for
the
morrow
,
and
partly
to
the
excitement
always
inseparable
in
that
house
from
Saturday
night
,
when
every
gentleman
's
linen
arrive
at
a
different
hour
in
its
own
little
bundle
,
with
his
private
account
pin
on
the
outside
.
<EOS>
there
be
always
a
great
clinking
of
patten
downstairs
,
too
,
until
midnight
or
so
,
on
Saturdays
;
together
with
a
frequent
gleaming
of
mysterious
light
in
the
area
;
much
work
at
the
pump
;
and
a
constant
jangling
of
the
iron
handle
of
the
pail
.
 
<EOS>
Shrill
altercation
from
time
to
time
arise
between
Mrs
Todgers
and
unknown
female
in
remote
back
kitchen
;
and
sound
be
occasionally
hear
,
indicative
of
small
article
of
iron
mongery
and
hardware
be
throw
at
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
custom
of
that
youth
on
Saturdays
,
to
roll
up
his
shirt
sleeve
to
his
shoulder
,
and
pervade
all
part
of
the
house
in
an
apron
of
coarse
green
baize
;
moreover
,
he
be
more
strongly
tempt
on
Saturdays
than
on
other
day
(
it
be
a
busy
time
)
,
to
make
excursive
bolt
into
the
neighbour
alley
when
he
answer
the
door
,
and
there
to
play
at
leap
-
frog
and
other
sport
with
vagrant
lad
,
until
pursue
and
bring
back
by
the
hair
of
his
head
or
the
lobe
of
his
ear
;
thus
he
be
quite
a
conspicuous
feature
among
the
peculiar
incident
of
the
last
day
in
the
week
at
Todgers
's
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
especially
so
on
this
particular
Saturday
evening
,
and
honour
the
Miss
Pecksniffs
with
a
deal
of
notice
;
seldom
pass
the
door
of
Mrs
Todgers
's
private
room
,
where
they
sit
alone
before
the
fire
,
work
by
the
light
of
a
solitary
candle
,
without
put
in
his
head
and
greet
them
with
some
such
compliment
as
,
"
there
you
be
agin
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
An't
it
nice
?
"
<EOS>
---
and
similar
humorous
attention
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
he
whisper
,
stop
in
one
of
his
journey
to
and
fro
,
"
young
lady
,
there
be

to

<EOS>
She

An't

?
 
<EOS>
oh
!
not
at
all
neither
!
"
   
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
answer
another
knock
,
he
thrust
in
his
head
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
fowl
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
not
skinny
one
.
 
<EOS>
oh

"
   
<EOS>
presently
he
call
through
the
key
-
hole
:
   
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
fish
to

morrow
.
 
<EOS>
just
come
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
eat
none

"
 
<EOS>
and
,
with
this
special
warning
,
vanish
again
.
   
<EOS>
by
-
and
-
bye
,
he
return
to
lay
the
cloth
for
supper
;
it
have
be
arrange
between
Mrs
Todgers
and
the
young
lady
,
that
they
should
partake
of
an
exclusive
veal
-
cutlet
together
in
the
privacy
of
that
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
He
entertain
them
on
this
occasion
by
thrust
the
light
candle
into
his
mouth
,
and
exhibit
his
face
in
a
state
of
transparency
;
after
the
performance
of
which
feat
,
he
go
on
with
his
professional
duty
;
brighten
every
knife
as
he
lay
it
on
the
table
,
by
breathe
on
the
blade
and
afterwards
polish
the
same
on
the
apron
already
mention
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
complete
his
preparation
,
he
grin
at
the
sister
,
and
express
his
belief
that
the
approach
collation
would
be
of
"
rather
a
spicy
sort
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
it
be
long
,
before
it
be
ready

Bailey

"
ask
Mercy

<EOS>
"

say
Bailey

and
eat

"
   
<EOS>
but
he
have
scarcely
achieve
the
utterance
of
these
word
,
when
he
receive
a
manual
compliment
on
the
head
,
which
send
him
staggering
against
the
wall
;
and
Mrs
Todgers
,
dish
in
hand
,
stand
indignantly
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"

say
Mr

lean
over
the
banister

with
an
odd
recollection
of
his
familiar
manner
among
new
pupil
at

"
that
I
should
very
much
like
to
see
Mrs
Todgers

notion
of
a

perfectly
agreeable
to
herself

<EOS>
as
it
appear
impossible
to
entertain
any
reasonable
hope
of
him
after
this
speech

Mr
Jinkins

Mr
Gander
go
upstairs
again

once
more
get
him
into
bed

but
they
have
not
descend

when
they
have
repeat
the
process
,
have
they
descend
the
first
flight
,
before
he
be
out
again

<EOS>
in
a
word
,
as
often
as
he
be
shut
up
in
his
own
room
,
he
dart
out
afresh
,
charge
with
some
new
moral
sentiment
,
which
he
continually
repeat
over
the
banister
,
with
extraordinary
relish
,
and
an
irrepressible
desire
for
the
improvement
of
his
fellow
creature
that
nothing
could
subdue

<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
,
when
they

him
into

for
the
thirtieth
time
or
so
,
Mr

hold
him

when
he
have
complete
his

they
lock
Mr

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
Time

no

but
there

edge

over
his

stand
the

prepare

wallow

<EOS>
the
trustfulness
of
his
two

beautiful
indeed

<EOS>
They

that
firm
reliance

Their

<EOS>
all
that
they

be
,
that
every
morning
,
after
the

the
advent
of
another

<EOS>
this
go

five
day

<EOS>
at
length
,
one
morning
,
Mr
Pecksniff
return
with
a
breathless
rapidity
,
strange
to
observe
in
him
,
at
other
time
so
calm
;
and
,
seek
immediate
speech
with
his
daughter
,
shut
himself
up
with
them
in
private
conference
for
two

<EOS>
of
all

<EOS>
"
how

come
to

very
much
(
if
it

turn
out
as
I
expect
,
that
he
have
)
,
we
need
not
stop
to
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
,
I
have
my
thought
upon
the
subject
,
but
I
will
not
impart
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
enough
that
we
will
not
be
proud
,
resentful
,
or
unforgive
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
want
our
friendship
he
shall
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
our
duty
,
I
hope
!
"
   
<EOS>
that
same
day
at
noon
,

old
gentleman

from
a
hackney

coach
at
the
post
-
office
,
and
,
give
his
name
,
inquire
for

It

very

indeed
nothing
more
than
an

with
Mr

's
respectful
,
and
(
not
withstand
what
have
pass
)
sincerely
affectionate
regard

"
 
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
tear
off
the
direction
---
scatter
the
rest
in
fragment
to
the
wind
---
and
give
it
to
the
coachman
,
bade
him
drive
as
near
that
place
as
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
in
pursuance
of
these
instruction
he
be
drive
to
the
Monument
;
where
he
again
alight
,
and
dismiss
the
vehicle
,
and
walk
towards
todger

<EOS>
though
the
face
,
and
form
,
and
gait
of
this
old
man
,
and
even
his
grip
of
the
stout
stick
on
which
he
lean
,
be
all
expressive
of
a
resolution
not
easily
shake
,
and
a
purpose
(
it
matter
little
<EOS>
whether
right
or
wrong
,
just
now
)
such
as
in
other
day
may
have
survive
the
rack
,
and
have
its
strong
life
in
weak
death
;
still
there
be
grain
of
hesitation
in
his
mind
,
which
make
him
now
avoid
the
house
he
seek
,
and
loiter
to
and
fro
in
a
gleam
of
sunlight
,
that
brighten
the
little
churchyard
hard
by
.
 
<EOS>
there
may
have
be
,
in
the
presence
of
those
idle
heap
of
dust
among
the
busy
stir
of
life
,
something
to
increase
his
wavering
;
but
there
he
walk
,
awaken
the
echo
as
he
pace
up
and
down
,
until
the
church
clock
,
strike
the
quarter
for
the
second
time
since
he
have
be
there
,
rouse
him
from
his
meditation
.
 
<EOS>
shake
off
his
incertitude
as
the
air
part
with
the
sound
of
the
bell
,
he
walk
rapidly
to
the
house
,
and
knock
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
be
seat
in
the
landlady
's
little
room
,
and
his
visitor
find
him
read
---
by
an
accident
;
he
apologise
for
it

an
excellent
theological
work
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
cake
and
wine
upon
a
little
table
---
by
another
accident
,
for
which
he
also
apologise
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
he
say
,
he
have
give
his
visitor
up
,
and
be
about
to
partake
of
that
simple
refreshment
with
his
child
,
when
he
knock
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Your
daughter
be
well

say
old
Martin

lay
down
his
hat

<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
endeavour
to
conceal
his
agitation
as
a
father
when
he
answer
yes
,
they
be
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
good
girl
,
he
say
,
very
good

<EOS>
He
would
not
venture
to
recommend
Mr
Chuzzlewit
to
take
the
easy
-
chair
,
or
to
keep
out
of
the
draught
from
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
make
any
such
suggestion
,
he
would
expose
himself
,
he
fear
,
to
most
unjust
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
,
therefore
,
content
himself
with
remark
that
there
be
an
easy
-
chair
in
the
room
,
and
that
the
door
be
far
from
be
air
-
tight
.
 
<EOS>
this
latter
imperfection
,
he
may
perhaps
venture
to
add
,
be
not
uncommonly
to
be
meet
with
in
old
house
.
   
<EOS>
the
old
man
sit
down
in
the
easy

chair
,
and
after
a
few
moment
'
silence
,
say
:
   
"

in
the
first
place

let
me
thank

give

time
to
get
upstairs

Mr

open
the

mildly
cry
in
the
passage

nothing

nothing
could
surpass

amazement

when

such
kind

the
two
Miss

cry
with
one
accord
,
"
thank
Heaven
for
this

and
fall
upon
the
old
man
's
neck
.
<EOS>
and
when
they
have
embrace
him
with
such
fervour
of
affection
that
no
word
can
describe
it
,
they
group
themselves
about
his
chair
,
and
hang
over
him
,
as
figure
to
themselves
no
earthly
joy
like
that
of
minister
to
his

crowd
into

several

the

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
tell
him
,

add
,
rather
hastily
;
his
caluminator
would
have
say
,
with
a
view
to
any
testamentary
thought
that
may

case

<EOS>
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
murmur
their
approval
of
this
wise
arrangement

their
cordial
sympathy
with

interesting
object

<EOS>
"
if
I
could
have
anticipate

come
to

between

four

say
the
old
man
thoughtfully
;
"
but
it
be
too
late
to
think
of
that
.

You
would
receive
her
courteously
,
young
lady
,

be
kind
to
her
,

<EOS>
where
be
the
orphan
whom
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
would
not

cherish
in

gush
forth

what
exhaustless
store

pure
affection

to
expend
themselves
upon

<EOS>
an
interval
ensue
,
during
which
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
in
an
absent
frame
of
mind
,
sit
gaze
at
the
ground
,
without
utter
a
word
;
and
as
it
be
plain
that
he
have
no
desire
to
be
interrupt
in
his
meditation
,
Mr
Pecksniff
and
his
daughter
be
profoundly
silent
also
.
 
<EOS>
during
the
whole
of
the
foregoing
dialogue
,
he
have
bear
his
part
with
a
cold
,
passionless
promptitude
,
as
though
he
have
learn
and
painfully
rehearse
it
all
a
hundred
time
.
 
<EOS>
even
when
his
expression
be
warm
and
his
language
most
encouraging
,
he
have
retain
the
same
manner
,
without
the
least
abatement
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
there
be
a
keen
brightness
in
his
eye
,
and
more
expression
in
his
voice
,
as
he
say
,
awaken
from
his
thoughtful
mood
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
will
be

of
this

have
you

of
what

my

<EOS>
Mr

ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
of
this
new
understanding
between

.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
look
benevolently
sagacious
,
and
at
the
same
time
far
above
all
earthly
misconstruction
,
as
he
shake
his
head
,
and
observe
that
a
great
many

would
be

all

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
answer
that
it
would
be
dreadfully
hard
to
bear
,

he
think
he
could
,
if
he
make
a
great
effort

other
will

I
speak

angry
people
only

that
you
have
lie
and
fawn
,
and
worm
yourself
through
dirty
way
into
my
favour
;
by
such
concession
and
such
crooked
deed
,
such
meanness

vile
endurance

nothing

repay

no

not
the
legacy

can
bear
that
?

<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
make
reply
that
this
would
be
also
very
hard
to
bear
,
as
reflect
,
in
some
degree
,
on
the
discernment
of
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
<EOS>
still
he
have
a
modest
confidence
that
he
could
sustain
the
calumny
,
with
the
help
of
a
good
conscience
,
and
that
gentleman
's
friendship

mass

old
Martin

back
in

the
tale
,

I
clearly
foresee
,
will
run
thus
:
that
to
mark
my
contempt
for
the
rabble
<EOS>
whom
I
despise
,
I
choose
from
among
them
the
very
bad
,
and
make
him
do
my
will
,
and
pamper
and
enrich
him
at
the
cost
of
all
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
after
cast
about
for
the
mean
of
a
punishment
which
should
rankle
in
the
bosom
of
these
kite
the
most
,
and
strike
into
their
gall
,
I
devise
this
scheme
at
a
time
when
the
last
link
in
the
chain
of
grateful
love

duty

that
hold
me

roughly

roughly

it

I
love
him
most

God
help
me

<EOS>

he
without

throw
me
off

I
cling
about
his
heart
!

passionate
outburst

stand
there

ask

want

I
will
not
stand
it

that
within

you

down

the

chapter
11
.
<EOS>
wherein
a
certain
gentleman
become
particular
in
his
attention
to
a
certain
lady
;
and
more
come
event
than
one
,
cast
their
shadow
before
 
the
family
be
within
two
or
three
day
of
their
departure
from
Mrs
Todgers
's
,
and
the
commercial
gentleman
be
to
a
man
despondent
and
not
to
be
comfort
,
because
of
the
approach
separation
,
when
Bailey
junior
,
at
the
jocund
time
of
noon
,
present
himself
before
Miss
Charity
Pecksniff
,
then
sit
with
her
sister
in
the
banquet
chamber
,
hem
six
new
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
for
Mr
Jinkins
;
and
have
express
a
hope
,
preliminary
and
pious
,
that
he
may
be
bl
,
give
her
in
his
pleasant
way
to
understand
that
a
visitor
attend
to
pay
his
respect
to
her
,
and
be
at
that
moment
wait
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
this
last
announcement
show
in
a
more
striking
point
of
view
than
many
lengthen
speech
could
have
do
,
the
trustfulness
and
faith
of
Bailey
's
nature
;
since
he
have
,
in
fact
,
last
see
the
visitor
on
the
door
-
mat
,
where
,
after
signify
to
him
that
he
would
do
well
to
go
upstairs
,
he
have
leave
him
to
the
guidance
of
his
own
sagacity
.
 
<EOS>
hence
it
be
at
least
an
even
chance
that
the
visitor
be
then
wander
on
the
roof
of
the
house
,
or
vainly
seek
to
extricate
himself
from
the
maze
of
bedroom
;
Todgers
's
be
precisely
that
kind
of
establishment
in
which
an
unpiloted
stranger
be
pretty
sure
to
find
himself
in
some
place
where
he
least
expect
and
least
desire
to
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
a
gentleman
for
me
!

Charity

pause
in
her
work

"
my
gracious
,
Bailey

Bailey

<EOS>
"
It

Would
not
I
be
gracious
neither

not
if
I
wos
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
the
remark
be
render
somewhat
obscure
in
itself
,
by
reason
(
as
the
reader
may
have
observe
)
of
a
redundancy
of
negative
;
but
accompany
by
action
expressive
of
a
faithful
couple
walk
arm
-
in
-
arm
towards
a
parochial
church
,
mutually
exchange
look
of
love
,
it
clearly
signify
this
youth
's
conviction
that
the
caller
's
purpose
be
of
an
amorous
tendency
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Charity
affect
to
reprove
so
great
a
liberty
;
but
she
could
not
help
smile
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
strange
boy
,
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
always
some
ground
of
probability
and
likelihood
mingle
with
his
absurd
behaviour
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
good
of
it
!
   
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
not
know
any
gentleman

Bailey
,

say
Miss
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
must
have
make
a
mistake

<EOS>
Mr
Bailey
smile
at
the
extreme
wildness
of
such
a
supposition

regard
the
young
lady
with
unimpaired
affability
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My

who
CAN

<EOS>
I
have
a
great

<EOS>
so
very
strange
,
you
know

"
   
<EOS>
the
young
sister
plainly
consider
that
this
appeal
have
its
origin
in
the
pride
of
be
call
upon
and
ask
for
;
and
that
it
be
intend
as
an
assertion
of
superiority
,
and
a
retaliation
upon

capture
the

<EOS>
therefore
,
she
reply
,
with
great
affection
and
politeness
,
that
it
be
,
no
doubt
,
very
strange
indeed
;

that
she
be
totally
at
a
loss
to
conceive
what
the
ridiculous
person
unknown
could
mean
by
it

<EOS>
"
quite
impossible

this
artless
inquiry
may
have
lead
to
turbulent
result

strong
emotion
of
delight
evince

and
force
him
to
the
instantaneous
performance
of
a
dancing
step
,
extremely
difficult
in
its
nature
,
and
only
to
be
achieve
in
a
moment
of
ecstasy
,
which

commonly
call
the
Frog

a

They

at

jointly
signify
to
Mr
Bailey
that
if
he
should
presume
to
practice
that
figure
any
more
in
their
presence
,
they
would
instantly
acquaint
Mrs
Todgers
with
the
fact
,
and
would
demand
his
condign
punishment
,
at
the
hand
of
that
lady

<EOS>
the
young

have
express
the
bitterness
of
his
contrition

wring
a
vast
amount
of

from

the
door
open
while
Miss

be
any

surprised
at
Mr

such
a
reference

do
any

doubt
the

that

if
he
will
take
the

he
may
find
a
great
number

confirmation

out

<EOS>
I
call

ask
you

after
enough
of
hesitation
to
impart
a

withdraw

odious

disagreeable

here
she
laugh
heartily

seem

enjoy
herself
very
much

you

regular
teaser

she

<EOS>
Miss
Charity
reply
in
effect
,
that
she
be
unable
to
say
what
the
habit
and
propensity
of
a
regular
teaser
may
be
;
and
that
even
if
she
possess
such
information
,
it
would
ill
become
her
to
admit
the
existence
of
any
creature
with
such
an
unceremonious
name
in

far
less
in

add
Cherry
with
an
angry
glance
,
"
whatever
her
real
nature
may
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Merry
,
"
the
only
observation
I
have
to
make
be
,
that
if
we
do
not
go
out
at
once
,
I
shall
certainly
take
my
bonnet
off
again
,
and
stay
at
home
.
"
   
<EOS>
this
threat
have
the
desire
effect
of
prevent
any
farther
altercation
,
for
Mr
Jonas
immediately
propose
an
adjournment
,
and
the
same
being
carry
unanimously
,
they
depart
from
the
house
straightway
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
doorstep
,
Mr
Jonas
give
an
arm
to
each
cousin
;
which
act
of
gallantry
be
observe
by
Bailey
junior
,
from
the
garret
window
,
be
by
him
salute
with
a
loud
and
violent
fit
of
coughing
,
to
which
paroxysm
he
be
still
the
victim
when
they
turn
the
corner
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
inquire
in
the
first
instance
if
they
be
good
walker
and
be
answer
,
"
yes
,
"
submit
their
pedestrian
power
to
a
pretty
severe
test
;
for
he
show
them
as
many
sight
,
in
the
way
of
bridge
,
church
,
street
,
outside
of
theatre
,
and
other
free
spectacle
,
in
that
one
forenoon
,
as
most
people
see
in
a
twelvemonth
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
observable
in
this
gentleman
,
that
he
have
an
insurmountable
distaste
to
the
inside
of
building
,
and
that
he
be
perfectly
acquaint
with
the
merit
of
all
show
,
in
respect
of
which
there
be
any
charge
for
admission
,
which
it
seem
be
every
one
detestable
,
and
of
the
very
low
grade
of
merit
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
so
thoroughly
possess

this
opinion
,
that
when

happen
to
mention
the
circumstance
of
their
have
be
twice

thrice
to
the
theatre
with

as
a
matter
of
course

where

Mr

description
entertain
,
observe
that
"
they
must
be
nice
flat
,
certainly
;
"
and
often
in
the
course
of
the
walk
,
burst
out
again
into
a
perfect
convulsion
of
laughter
at
the
surpass
silliness
of
those
gentleman
,
and
(
doubtless
)
at
his
own
superior
wisdom
.
   
<EOS>
when
they
have
be
out
for
some
hour
and
be
thoroughly
fatigue
,
it
be
by
that
time
twilight
<EOS>
,
Mr

intimate
that
he
would
show
them
one
of
the
good
piece
of
fun
with
which
he
be
acquaint

this
joke
be
of

for

happily
it

to

place
where
Mr

Anthony

Manchester
Warehousemen

and
so
forth

have
its
place
of
business
in
a
very
narrow
street
somewhere
behind
the
Post
Office
;
where
every

be
in

very
gloomy

and
where

in
fantastic
pattern

where
spruce
gentleman
with
their

pocket
of
symmetrical

be
always
to

in
warm
weather

contemplate

firm
of
Anthony
Chuzzlewit

transact
all
their
business
and
their
pleasure
too

an
ancient
proverb
warn
us
that
we
should
not

to
find
old
head
upon

shoulder
;
to
which
it
may
be
add
that
we
seldom
meet
with
that
unnatural
combination

we
feel
a
strong
desire
to
knock
them
off
;
merely
from
an
inherent
love
we
have
of

It

that

by

feel
this
impulse
rise
up
within
them
,
when
they
first
make
the
acquaintance
of
Mr

if
they
have
know
him
more
intimately
in
his

have
sit
with
him
at

it
would
assuredly
have

He
be
of

dress
in

decayed
suit

with

garnish
at

knee
with
rusty
wisp
of

pauper

dingy

He
look

creep
into

from

,
as
his

become
conscious

stranger

those
stranger

he
rise
again
,
apparently
intend

make
a
bow

but
he
sit
down
once
more
without
have
make
it

breathe
on

remain
with

him
in

up

with

smilingly

listen
for
some
further

be
speak
to
no

the
light
forsook
his
face
by
little

little

be
nothing

"
He

now

do
you
ever
see

eyed
expression

get

if
it
have
not

for
the
joke

it

I
would
not
have
let
him
come
in
to

day
;
but
I
think
he
would
amuse
you

"
   
<EOS>
the
poor
old
subject
of
this
humane
speech
be
,
happily
for
himself
,
as
unconscious
of
its
purport
as
of
most
other
remark
that
be
make
in
his
presence
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
mutton
be
tough
,
and
his
gum
weak
,
he
quickly
verify
the
statement
relative
to
his
choke
propensity
,
and
undergo
so
much
in
his
attempt
to
dine
,
that
Mr
Jonas
be
infinitely
amuse
;
protest
that
he
have
seldom
see
him
well
company
in
all
his
life
,
and
that
he
be
enough
to
make
a
man
split
his
side
with
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
go
so
far
as
to
assure
the
sister
,
that
in
this
point
of
view
he
consider
Chuffey
superior
to
his
own
father
;
which
,
as
he
significantly
add
,
be
say
a
great
deal
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
strange
enough
that
Anthony
Chuzzlewit
,
himself
so
old
a
man
,
should
take
a
pleasure
in
these
gibing
of
his
estimable
son
at
the
expense
of
the
poor
shadow
at
their
table
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
do
,
unquestionably
;
though
not
so
much
---
to
do
him
justice
---
with
reference
to
their
ancient
clerk
,
as
in
exultation
at
the
sharpness
of
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
same
reason
that
young
man
's
coarse
allusion
,
even
to
himself
,
fill
him
with
a
stealthy
glee
;
cause
him
to
rub
his
hand
and
chuckle
covertly
,
as
if
he
say
in
his
sleeve
,
"
I
teach
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
train
him

<EOS>
this
be
the
heir
of

up

Sly

cunning

covetous

he

not
squander
my

<EOS>
I
work
for
this

I
hope
for
this
;
it
have
be
the
great
end

aim
of
my

"
   
<EOS>
what
a
noble
end
<EOS>
and
aim
it
be
to
contemplate
in
the
attainment
truly
!
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
some
who
manufacture
idol
after
the
fashion
of
themselves
,
and
fail
to
worship
them
when
they
be
make

charge
their

Anthony
be
well
than
these
at

Chuffey
boggle
over

long

take
it
from
him
at

with

consider
this
so
particularly
childish
(
perhaps
with
some
reason
)
,
that
he
only
laugh
the
more
,
and
tell
his
cousin
that
he
be
afraid
one
of
these
fine
day
,
Chuffey
would
be
the
death
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
cloth
be
then
remove

from
which
Mr

fill
the
young

call
on

not
to
spare
it
,
as
they
may
be
certain
there
be
plenty
more
where
that
come
from
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
add
with
some
haste
after
this
sally
that
it
be
only
his
joke
,
and
they
would
not
suppose
him
to
be
in
earnest
<EOS>
,
he
be
sure

in

petulant
manner

<EOS>
"
You
can
tell
her

if
you

can
not
you

"
   
<EOS>
"
She
seem
to
make
such
game
of

reply
Mr

<EOS>
"
then
why
need
you
trouble
yourself
about

"
say
Charity

<EOS>
"
I
be

not

<EOS>
"

return
the
young

<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
make
no
verbal
rejoinder
,
but
he
glance
at
Mercy
with
an
odd
expression
in
his
face
;
and
say
that
would
not
break
his
heart
,
she
may
depend
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
look
on
Charity
with
even
great
favour
than
before
,
and
besought
her
,
as
his
polite
manner
be
,
to
"
come
a
little
close
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
there
be
another
thing
that

"
remark
Jonas
,
after
a
short
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
?
"
<EOS>
ask
the
father
;
grin
already
in
anticipation

<EOS>
"
a
bargain

the

<EOS>
"
here
be
the
rule

<EOS>
do

all

"
   
<EOS>
the
delighted
father
applaud
this
sentiment
to
the
echo
;
and
be
so
much
tickle
by
it
,
that
he
be
at
the
pain
of
impart
the
same
to
his
ancient
clerk
,
who
rub
his
hand
,
nod
his
palsied
head
,
wink
his
watery
eye
,
and
cry
in
his
whistle
tone
,
"
<EOS>
good
!
<EOS>
good
!
 
<EOS>
Your

son
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
"
with
every
feeble
demonstration
of
delight
that
he
be
capable
of
make
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
old
man
's
enthusiasm
have
the
redeeming
quality
of
be
feel
in
sympathy
with
the
only
creature
to
whom
he
be
link
by
tie
of
long
association
,
and
by
his
present
helplessness
.
 
<EOS>
and
if
there
have
be
anybody
there
,
who
care
to
think
about
it
,
some
dreg
of
a
well
nature
unawakene

may
perhaps
have

descry
through

melancholy

out

call
Chuffey

<EOS>
as
matter
stand
,
nobody
think
or
say
anything
upon
the
subject
;
so
Chuffey
fall
back
into
a
dark
corner
on
one
side
of
the
fireplace
,
where
he
always
spend
his
evening
,
and
be
neither
see
nor
hear
again
that
night
;
save
once
,
when
a
cup
of
tea
be
give
him
,
in
which
he
be
see
to
soak
his
bread
mechanically
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
reason
to
suppose
that
he
go
to
sleep
at
these
season
,
or
that
he
hear
,
or
see
,
or
feel

<EOS>
He
remain
,
as
it
be
,
freeze
up
---
if
any
term
expressive
of
such
a
vigorous
process
can
be
apply
to
him
---
until
he
be
again
thaw
for
the
moment
by
a
word
or
touch
from
Anthony
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Charity
make
tea
by
desire
of
Mr
Jonas
,
and
feel
and
look
so
like
the
lady
of
the
house
that
she
be
in
the
prettiest
confusion
imaginable
;
the
more
so
from
Mr
Jonas
sit
close
beside
her
,
and
whisper
a
variety
of
admire
expression
in
her
ear
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mercy
,
for
her
part
,
feel
the
entertainment
of
the
evening
to
be
so
distinctly
and
exclusively
theirs
,
that
she
silently
deplore
the
commercial
gentleman
---
at
that
moment
,
no
doubt
,
weary
for
her
return
---
and
yawn
over
yesterday
's
newspaper
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
Anthony
,
he
go
to
sleep
outright
,
so
Jonas
and
Cherry
have
a
clear
stage
to
themselves
as
long
as
they
choose
to
keep
possession
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
tea
-
tray
be
take
away
,
as
it
be
at
last
,
Mr
Jonas
produce
a
dirty
pack
of
card
,
and
entertain
the
sister
with
diver
small
feat
of
dexterity
:
whereof
the
main
purpose
of
every
one
be
,
that
you
be
to
decoy
somebody
into
lay
a
wager
with
you
that
you
could
not
do
it
;
and
be
then
immediately
to
win
and
pocket
his
money
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
inform
them
that
these
accomplishment
be
in
high
vogue
in
the
most
intellectual
circle
,
and
that
large
amount
be
constantly
change
hand
on
such
hazard
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
may
be
remark
that
he
fully
believe
this
;
for
there
be
a
simplicity
of
cunne
no
less
than
a
simplicity
of
innocence
;
and
in
all
matter
where
a
lively
faith
in
knavery
and
meanness
be
require
as
the
ground
-
work
of
belief
,
Mr
Jonas
be
one
of
the
most
credulous
of
man
.
 
<EOS>
His
ignorance
,
which
be
stupendous
,
may
be
take
into
account
,
if
the
reader
please
,
separately
.
   
<EOS>
this
fine
young
man
have
all
the
inclination
to
be
a
profligate
of
the
first
water
,
and
only
lack
the
one
good
trait
in
the
common
catalogue
of
debauch
vice
---
open
-
handedness
---
to
be
a
notable
vagabond
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
his
griping
and
penurious
habit
step
in
;
and
as
one
poison
will
sometimes
neutralise
another
,
when
wholesome
remedy
would
not
avail
,
so
he
be
restrain
by
a
bad
passion
from
quaff
his
full
measure
of
evil
,
when
virtue
may
have
seek
to
hold
him
back
in
vain
.
   
<EOS>
by
the
time
he
have
unfold
all
the
peddling
scheme
he
know
upon
the
card
,
it
be
grow
late
in
the
evening
;
and
Mr
Pecksniff
not
make
his
appearance
,
the
young
lady
express
a
wish
to
return
home
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
,
Mr
Jonas
,
in
his
gallantry
,
would
by
no
mean
allow
,
until
they
have
partake
of
some
bread
and
cheese
and
porter
;
and
even
then
he
be
excessively
unwilling
to
allow
them
to
depart
;
often
beseech
Miss
Charity
to
come
a
little
close
,
or
to
stop
a
little
longer
,
and
prefer
many
other
complimentary
petition
of
that
nature
in
his
own
hospitable
and
earnest
way
.
 
<EOS>
when
all
his
effort
to
detain
them
be
fruitless
,
he
put
on
his
hat
and
greatcoat
preparatory
to
escort
them
to
Todgers
's
;
remark
that
he
know
they
would
rather
walk
thith
than
ride
;
and
that
for
his
part
he
be
quite
of
their
opinion
.
   
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
Miss
Charity
be
more
entertain
by
this
repartee
than
one
would
have
suppose
likely
,
consider
its
advanced
age
and
simple
character
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
her
sisterly
affection
she
take
Mr
Jonas
to
task
for
lean
so
very
hard
upon
a
break
reed
,
and
say
that
he
must
not
be
so
cruel
to
poor
Merry
any
more
,
or
she
(
charity
)
would
positively
be
oblige
to
hate
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mercy
,
who
really
have
her
share
of
good
humour
,
only
retort
with
a
laugh
;
and
they
walk
home
in
consequence
without
any
angry
passage
of
word
upon
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
be
in
the
middle
,
and
have
a
cousin
on
each
arm
,
sometimes
squeeze
the
wrong
one
;
so
tightly
too
,
as
to
cause
her
not
a
little
inconvenience
;
but
as
he
talk
to
Charity
in
whisper
the
whole
time
,
and
pay
her
great
attention
,
no
doubt
this
be
an
accidental
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
arrive
at
Todgers
's
,
and
the
door
be
open
,
mercy
break
hastily
from
them
,
and
run
upstairs
;
but
Charity
and
Jonas
linger
on
the
step
talk
together
for
more
than
five
minute
;
so
,
as
Mrs
Todgers
observe
next
morning
,
to
a
third
party
,
"
It
be
pretty
clear
what
be
go
on
there

glad

for
it
really

high
time
that

of

"
   
<EOS>
and
now
the
day
be
come
on
,
when
that
bright
vision
which
have
burst
on
todger

so
suddenly
,
and
make
a
sunshine
in
the
shady
breast
of
Jinkins
,
be
to
be

no

when
it
be
to

like

I
must
not

I
promise

<EOS>
"
why

then

it
have
be
fix

they

they
vow
they
could
not

of
go
to
bed
until
the
serenade
be
over

but
half
an
hour
of
cool
waiting
so
alter
their
opinion
that
they
not

go

fall
asleep

not

Jinkins

the
bass
;
and
the
rest
take
anything
they
could
get
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
blow
his
melancholy
into
a
flute
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
blow
much
out
of
it
,
but
that
be
all
the
well
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
and
Mrs
Todgers
have
perish
by
spontaneous
combustion
,
and
the
serenade
have
be
in
honour
of
their
ashe
,
it
would
have
be
impossible
to
surpass
the
unutterable
despair
express
in
that
one
chorus
,
"
go
where
glory
wait
thee
!
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
requiem
,
a
dirge
,
a
moan
,
a
howl
,
a
wail
,
a
lament
,
an
abstract
of
everything
that
be
sorrowful
and
hideous
in
sound
.
 
<EOS>
the
flute
of
the
young
gentleman
be
wild
and
fitful
.
 
<EOS>
It
come
and
go
in
gust
,
like
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
long
time
together
he
seem
to
have
leave
off
,
and
when
it
be
quite
settle
by
Mrs
Todgers
and
the
young
lady
that
,
overcome
by
his
feeling
,
he
have
retire
in
tear
,
he
unexpectedly
turn
up
again
at
the
very
top
of
the
tune
,
gasp
for
breath
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
tremendous
performer
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
knowing
where
to
have
him
;
and
exactly
when
you
think
he
be
do
nothing
at
all
,
then
be
he
do
the
very
thing
that
ought
to
astonish
you
most
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
several
of
these
concerted
piece
;
perhaps
two
or
three
too
many
,
though
that
,
as
Mrs
Todgers
say
,
be
a
fault
on
the
right
side
.
 
<EOS>
but
even
then
,
even
at
that
solemn
moment
,
when
the
thrilling
sound
may
be
presume
to
have
penetrate
into
the
very
depth
of
his
nature
,
if
he
have
any
depth
,
Jinkins
could
not
leave
the
young
gentleman
alone
.
 
<EOS>
He
ask
him
distinctly
,
before
the
second
song
begin
---
as
a
personal
favour
too
,
mark
the
villain
in
that
---
not
to
play
.
 
<EOS>
yes
<EOS>
;
he
say
so
;
not
to
play
.
 
<EOS>
the
breathing
of
the
young
gentleman
be
hear
through
the
key
-
hole
of
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
DIDN'T
play
.
 
<EOS>
what
vent
be
a
flute
for
the
passion
swell
up
within
his
breast
?
 
<EOS>
a
trombone
would
have
be
a
world
too
mild
.
   
<EOS>
the
serenade
approach
its
close
.
 
<EOS>
Its
crowning
interest
be
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
the
gentleman
of
a
literary
turn
have
write
a
song
on
the
departure
of
the
lady
,
and
adapt
it
to
an
old
tune
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
join
,
except
the
young
gentleman
in
company
,
who
,
for
the
reason
aforesaid
,
maintain
a
fearful
silence
.
 
<EOS>
the
song
(
which
be
of
a
classical
nature
)
invoke
the
oracle
of
Apollo
,
and
demand
to
know
what
would
become
of
todger
's
when
CHARITY
and
MERCY
be
banish
from
its
wall
.
 
<EOS>
the
oracle
deliver
no
opinion
particularly
worth
remember
,
accord
to
the
not
infrequent
practice
of
oracle
from
the
early
age
down
to
the
present
time
.
<EOS>
in
the
absence
of
enlightenment
on
that
subject
,
the
strain
desert
it
,
and
go
on
to
show
that
the
Miss
Pecksniffs
be
nearly
relate
to
Rule
Britannia
,
and
that
if
Great
Britain
have
not
be
an
island
,
there
could
have
be
no
Miss
Pecksniffs
.
 
<EOS>
and
be
now
on
a
nautical
tack
,
it
close
with
this
verse
:
    
"
all
hail
to
the
vessel
of
Pecksniff
the
sire
!
    
<EOS>
and
favour
breeze
to
fan
;
     
while
Tritons
flock
round
it
,
and
proudly
admire
    
the
architect
,
artist
,
and
man
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
as
they
present
this
beautiful
picture
to
the
imagination
,
the
gentleman
gradually
withdraw
to
bed
to
give
the
music
the
effect
of
distance
;
and
so
it
die
away
,
and
Todgers
's
be
leave
to
its
repose
.
   
<EOS>
Mr

reserve
his
vocal

,
pack
up

them
to
an
imitation
of

I

It

it

Anthony
glance
at

very

It

Mr

when

down

a
nod
of
intelligence

move
away

leave

discomfit

such
very
plain

you
would

serenity

lustily
resound

Doubtful

from
its

hovering

the
smoke

steam

death
have
clog
the
key

I
be
afraid

I

upon

fix

send
his

three
may
have
the
pleasure

dining
together

not
at

house

you
and
I
be

either

at
the
very
first
hotel
in
the
town

<EOS>
read
what
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
very
well

Martin

glance
over
it
with
his
customary
coolness
;
"
much
oblige
to
him

<EOS>
I
be
agreeable

"
   
<EOS>
Tom
could
have
wish
him
to
be
a
little
more
astonished
,
a
little
more
pleased
,
or
in
some
form
or
other
a
little
more
interested
in
such
a
great
event
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
perfectly
self

possess
;
and
fall
into
his
favourite
solace
of
whistling
,
take
another
turn
at
the
grammar

school
,
as
if
nothing
at
all
have
happen

<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff

horse
be
regard
in
the
light
of
a
sacred
animal

only
to
be
drive
by

the
chief
priest
of
that
temple

by
some
person
distinctly
nominate
for
the
time
be
to
that
high
office
by
himself
,
the
two
young
man
agree
to
walk
to
Salisbury
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
when
the
time
come
,
they
set
off
on
foot
;
which
be
,
after
all
,
a
well
mode
of
travel
than
in
the
gig
,
as
the
weather
be
very
cold
and
very
dry
.
   
<EOS>
better
!
 
<EOS>
a
rare
strong
,
hearty
,
healthy
walk
---
four
statute
mile
an
hour
---
preferable
to
that
rumbling
,
tumble
,
jolt
,
shake
,
scraping
,
creak
,
villanous
old
gig
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
the
two
thing
will
not
admit
of
comparison
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
insult
to
the
walk
,
to
set
them
side
by
side
.
 
<EOS>
where
be
an
instance
of
a
gig
have
ever
circulate
a
man
's
blood
,
unless
when
,
put
him
in
danger
of
his
neck
,
it
awaken
in
his
vein
and
in
his
ear
,
and
all
along
his
spine
,
a
tingling
heat
,
much
more
peculiar
than
agreeable
?
 
<EOS>
when
do
a
gig
ever
sharpen
anybody
's
wit
and
energy
,
unless
it
be
when
the
horse
bolt
,
and
,
crash
madly
down
a
steep
hill
with
a
stone
wall
at
the
bottom
,
his
desperate
circumstance
suggest
to
the
only
gentleman
leave
inside
,
some
novel
and
unheard
-
of
mode
of
drop
out
behind
?
 
<EOS>
well
than
the
gig
!
   
<EOS>
the
air
be
cold
,
Tom
;
so
it
be
,
<EOS>
there
be
no
deny
it
;
but
would
it
have
be
more
genial
in
the
gig
?
 
<EOS>
the
blacksmith
's
fire
burn
very
bright
,
and
leap
up
high
,
as
though
it
want
man
to
warm
;
but
would
it
have
be
less
tempting
,
look
at
from
the
clammy
cushion
of
a
gig
?
 
<EOS>
the
wind
blow
keenly
,
nip
the
feature
of
the
hardy
wight
who
fight
his
way
along
;
blind
him
with
his
own
hair
if
he
have
enough
to
it
,
and
wintry
dust
if
he
have
not
;
stop
his
breath
as
though
he
have
be
souse
in
a
cold
bath
;
tear
aside
his
wrapping
-
up
,
and
whistle
in
the
very
marrow
of
his
bone
;
but
it
would
have
do
all
this
a
hundred
time
more
fiercely
to
a
man
in
a
gig
,
would
not
it
?
 
<EOS>
a
fig
for
gig
!
   
<EOS>
well
than
the
gig
!
 
<EOS>
when
be
traveller
by
wheel
and
hoofs
see
with
such
red
-
hot
cheek
as
those
?
<EOS>
when
be
they
so
good
-
humouredly
and
merrily
bloused
?
<EOS>
when
do
their
laughter
ring
upon
the
air
,
as
they
turn
them
round
,
what
time
the
strong
gust
come
sweep
up
;
and
,
face
round
again
as
they
pass
by
,
dash
on
,
in
such
a
glow
of
ruddy
health
as
nothing
could
keep
pace
with
,
but
the
high
spirit
it
engender
?
 
<EOS>
well
than
the
gig
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
here
be
a
man
in
a
gig
come
the
same
way
now
.
 
<EOS>
look
at
him
as
he
pass
his
whip
into
his
left
hand
,
chafe
his
numbed
right
finger
on
his
granite
leg
,
and
beat
those
marble
toe
of
his
upon
the
foot
-
board
.
<EOS>
ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
who
would
exchange
this
rapid
hurry
of
the
blood
for
yonder
stagnant
misery
,
though
its
pace
be
twenty
mile
for
one
?
   
<EOS>
well
than
the
gig
!
 
<EOS>
no
man
in
a
gig
could
have
such
interest
in
the
milestone
.
 
<EOS>
no
man
in
a
gig
could
see
,
or
feel
,
or
think
,
like
merry
user
of
their
leg
.
 
<EOS>
how
,
as
the
wind
sweep
on
,
upon
these
breezy
down
,
it
track
its
flight
in
darken
ripple
on
the
grass
,
and
smooth
shadow
on
the
hill
!
 
<EOS>
look
round
and
round
upon
this
bare
bleak
plain
,
and
see
even
here
,
upon
a
winter
's
day
,
how
beautiful
the
shadow
be
!
 
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
it
be
the
nature
of
their
kind
to
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
the
lovely
thing
in
life
,
Tom
,
be
but
shadow
;
and
they
come
and
go
,
and
change
and
fade
away
,
as
rapidly
as
these
!
   
<EOS>
another
mile
,
and
then
begin
a
fall
of
snow
,
make
the
crow
,
who
skim
away
so
close
above
the
ground
to
shirk
the
wind
,
a
blot
of
ink
upon
the
landscape
.
 
<EOS>
but
though
it
drive
and
drift
against
them
as
they
walk
,
stiffen
on
their
skirt
,
and
freeze
in
the
lash
of
their
eye
,
they
would
not
have
it
fall
more
sparingly
,
no
,
not
so
much
as
by
a
single
flake
,
although
they
have
to
go
a
score
of
mile
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
lo
!
<EOS>
the
tower
of
the
Old
Cathedral
rise
before
them
,
even
now
!
<EOS>
and
by
-
and
-
bye
they
come
into
the
sheltered
street
,
make
strangely
silent
by
their
white
carpet
;
and
so
to
the
Inn
for
which
they
be
bind
;
<EOS>
where
they
present
such
flushed
and
burn
face
to
the
cold
waiter
,
and
be
so
brimful
of
vigour

that
he
almost
feel
assault
by
their
presence

and
,
have
nothing
to
oppose
to
the
attack
(
be
fresh

or
rather
stale
,
from
the
blaze
fire
in
the
coffee

be
quite
put

his
pale
countenance

a
famous
Inn

<EOS>
the
hall
a
very
grove

John
Westlock
;
not
the
old
John
of
Pecksniff
's
,
but
a
proper
gentleman
;
look
another
and
a
grander
person
,
with
the
consciousness
of
be
his
own
master
and
have
money
in
the
bank
;
and
yet
in
some
respect
the
old
John
too
,
for
he
seize
Tom
Pinch
by
both
his
hand
the
instant
he
appear
,
and
fairly
hug
him
,
in
his
cordial
welcome
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
this
,
"
say
John
,
"
be
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
glad
to
see
him
!
"
<EOS>
---
John
have
an
off
-
hand
manner
of
his
own
;
so
they
shake
hand
warmly
,
and
be
friend
in
no
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
stand
off
a
moment
,
Tom
,
"
cry
the
old
pupil
,
lay
one
hand
on
each
of
Mr
Pinch
's
shoulder
,
and
hold
him
out
at
arm
's
length
.
"
<EOS>
let
me
look
at
you
!
 
<EOS>
just
the
same
!
 
<EOS>
not
a
bit
changed
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
it
be
not
so
very
long
ago
,
you
know
,
"
say
Tom
Pinch
,
"
after
all
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
seem
an
age
to
me
,
"
cry
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
so
it
ought
to
seem
to
you
,
you
dog
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
push
Tom
down
into
the
easy
chair
,
and
clap
him
on
the
back
so
heartily
,
and
so
like
his
old
self
in
their
old
bedroom
at
old
Pecksniff
's
that
it
be
a
toss
-
up
with
Tom
Pinch
whether
he
should
laugh
or
cry
.
 
<EOS>
Laughter
win
it
;
and
they
all
three
laugh
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
order
everything
for
dinner
,
that
we
use
to
say
we
would
have

Tom

"
observe
John
Westlock
.
   
<EOS>
"
no
!
"
say
Tom
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
everything
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
laugh
,
if
you
can
help
it
,
before
the
waiter
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
when
I
be
order
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
like
a
dream
.
"
   
<EOS>
John
be
wrong
there
,
because
nobody
ever
dream
such
soup
as
be
put
upon
the
table
directly
afterwards
;
or
such
fish
;
or
such
side
-
dish
;
or
such
a
top
and
bottom
;
or
such
a
course
of
bird
and
sweet
;
or
in
short
anything
approach
the
reality
of
that
entertainment
at
ten
-
and
-
sixpence
a
head
,
exclusive
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
them
,
the
man
who
can
dream
such
iced
champagne
,
such
claret
,
port
,
or
sherry
,
have
better
go
to
bed
and
stop
there
.
   
<EOS>
but
perhaps
the
fine
feature
of
the
banquet
be
,
that
nobody
be
half
so
much
amazed
by
everything
as
John
himself
,
who
in
his
high
delight
be
constantly
burst
into
fit
of
laughter
,
and
then
endeavour
to
appear
preternaturally
solemn
,
lest
the
waiter
should
conceive
he
be
not
use
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
the
thing
they
bring
him
to
carve
,
be
such
outrageous
practical
joke
,
though
,
that
it
be
impossible
to
stand
it
;
and
when
Tom
Pinch
insist
,
in
spite
of
the
deferential
advice
of
an
attendant
,
not
only
on
break
down
the
outer
wall
of
a
raise
pie
with
a
tablespoon
,
but
on
try
to
eat
it
afterwards
,
John
lose
all
dignity
,
and
sit
behind
the
gorgeous
dish
-
cover
at
the
head
of
the
table
,
roar
to
that
extent
that
he
be
audible
in
the
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
nor
have
he
the
least
objection
to
laugh
at
himself
,
as
he
demonstrate
when
they
have
all
three
gather
round
the
fire
and
the
dessert
be
on
the
table
;
at
which
period
the
head
waiter
inquire
with
respectful
solicitude
whether
that
port
,
be
a
light
and
tawny
wine
,
<EOS>
be
suit
to
his
taste
,
or
whether
he
would
wish
to
try
a
fruity
port
with
great
body
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
John
gravely
answer
that
he
be
well
satisfied
with
what
he
have
,
which
he
esteem
,
as
one
may
say
,
a
pretty
tidy
vintage
;
for
which
the
waiter
thank
him
and
withdraw
.
<EOS>
and
then
John
tell
his
friend
,
with
a
broad
grin
,
that
he
suppose
it
be
all
right
,
but
he
do
not
know
;
and
go
off
into
a
perfect
shout
.
   
<EOS>
They
be
very
merry
and
full
of
enjoyment
the
whole
time
,
but
not
the
least
pleasant
part
of
the
festival
be
when
they
all
three
sit
about
the
fire
,
crack
nut
,
drink
wine
and
talk
cheerfully
.
<EOS>
It
happen
that
Tom
Pinch
have
a
word
to
say
to
his
friend
the
organist
's
assistant
,
and
so
desert
his
warm
corner
for
a
few
minute
at
this
season
,
lest
it
should
grow
too
late
;
leave
the
other
two
young
man
together
.
   
<EOS>
They
drink
his
health
in
his
absence
,
of
course
;
and
John
Westlock
take
that
opportunity
of
say
,
that
he
have
never
have
even
a
peevish
word
with
Tom
during
the
whole
term
of
their
residence
in
Mr
Pecksniff
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
this
naturally
lead
him
to
dwell
upon
Tom
's
character
,
and
to
hint
that
Mr
Pecksniff
understand
it

He

hint
this

very
distantly

know
that
it
pain
Tom
Pinch
to
have
that
gentleman
disparage

think
it
would
be
as
well
to
leave
the
new

to
his
own
discovery

yes

It

it

"
   
<EOS>
John

echo
the
sentiment
,
or
nearly
so
;
for
he
drink
Mr
Pecksniff
's
health
,
and
something
to
him

but
what
,
be
not
quite
audible
.
 
<EOS>
the
general
unanimity
be
then
completely
restore
,
they
draw
their
chair
closer
round
the
fire
,
and
converse
in
perfect
harmony
and
enjoyment
until
bed
-
time
.
   
<EOS>
no
slight
circumstance
,
perhaps
,
could
have
better
illustrate
the
difference
of
character
between
John
Westlock
and
Martin
Chuzzlewit
,
than
the
manner
in
which
each
of
the
young
man
contemplate
Tom
Pinch
,
after
the
little
rupture
just
describe
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
certain
amount
of
jocularity
in
the
look
of
both
,
no
doubt
,
but
there
all
resemblance
cease
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
pupil
could
not
do
enough
to
show
Tom
how
cordially
he
feel
towards
him
,
and
his
friendly
regard
seem
of
a
graver
and
more
thoughtful
kind
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
the
new
one
,
on
the
other
hand
,
have
no
impulse
but
to
laugh
at
the
recollection
of
Tom
's
extreme
absurdity
;
and
mingle
with
his
amusement
there
be
something
slight
and
contemptuous
,
indicative
,
as
it
appear
,
of
his
opinion
that
Mr
Pinch
be
much
too
far
go
in
simplicity
to
be
admit
as
the
friend
,
on
serious
and
equal
term
,
of
any
rational
man

<EOS>
John

have
provide
bed
for

after

very
happy
evening

<EOS>
Mr

on

ruminate
on

good
quality

with
great
gravity

of

and
thus
they
part
for
the
night
;
John
Westlock
full
of
light
-
heartedness
and
good
humour
,
and
poor
Tom
Pinch
quite
satisfied
;
though
still
,
as
he
turn
over
on
his
side
in
bed
,
he
mutter
to
himself
,
"
I
really
do
wish
,
for
all
that
,
though
,
that
he
be
not
acquaint
with
Mr
Tigg
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
breakfast
together
very
early
next
morning
,
for
the
two
young
man
desire
to
get
back
again
in
good
season
;
and
John
Westlock
be
to
return
to
London
by
the
coach
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
have
some
hour
to
spare
,
he
bear
them
company
for
three
or
four
mile
on
their
walk
,
and
only
part
from
them
at
last
in
sheer
necessity
.
 
<EOS>
the
parting
be
an
unusually
hearty
one
,
not
only
as
between
him
and
Tom
Pinch
,
but
on
the
side
of
Martin
also
,
who
have
find
in
the
old
pupil
a
very
different
sort
of
person
from
the
milksop
he
have
prepare
himself
to
expect
.
   
<EOS>
Young
Westlock
stop
upon
a
rise
ground
,
when
he
have
go
a
little
distance
,
and
look
back
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
walk
at
a
brisk
pace
,
and
Tom
appear
to
be
talk
earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
have
take
off
his
greatcoat
,
the
wind
be
now
behind
them
,
and
carry
it
upon
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
look
,
he
see
Tom
relieve
him
of
it
,
after
a
faint
resistance
,
and
,
throw
it
upon
his
own
,
encumber
himself
with
the
weight
of
both
.
 
<EOS>
this
trivial
incident
impress
the
old
pupil
mightily
,
for
he
stand
there
,
gaze
after
them
,
until
they
be
hide
from
his
view
;
when
he
shake
his
head
,
as
if
he
be
trouble
by
some
uneasy
reflection
,
and
thoughtfully
retrace
his
step
to
Salisbury
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
Martin
and
Tom
pursue
their
way
,
until
they
halt
,
safe
and
sound
,
at
Mr
Pecksniff
's
house
,
where
a
brief
epistle
from
that
good
gentleman
to
Mr
Pinch
announce
the
family
's
return
by
that
night
's
coach
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
would
pass
the
corner
of
the
lane
at
about
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
Mr
Pecksniff
request
that
the
gig
may
be
in
wait
at
the
finger
-
post
about
that
time
,
together
with
a
cart
for
the
luggage
.
 
<EOS>
and
to
the
end
that
he
may
be
receive
with
the
great
honour
,
the
young
man
agree
to
rise
early
,
and
be
upon
the
spot
themselves
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
the
least
cheerful
day
they
have
yet
pass
together
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
be
out
of
spirit
and
out
of
humour
,
and
take
every
opportunity
of
compare
his
condition
and
prospect
with
those
of
young
Westlock
;
much
to
his
own
disadvantage
always
.
 
<EOS>
this
mood
of
his
depressed
Tom
;
and
neither
that
morning
's
parting
,
nor
yesterday
's
dinner
,
help
to
mend
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
so
the
hour
drag
on
heavily
enough
;
and
they
be
glad
to
go
to
bed
early
.
   
<EOS>
They
be
not
quite
so
glad
to
get
up
again
at
half
-
past
four
o'clock
,
in
all
the
shivering
discomfort
of
a
dark
winter
's
morning
;
but
they
turn
out
punctually
,
and
be
at
the
finger
-
post
full
half
-
an
-
hour
before
the
appoint
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
by
any
mean
a
lively
morning
,
for
the
sky
be
black
and
cloudy
,
and
it
rain
hard
;
but
Martin
say
there
be
some
satisfaction
in
see
that
brute
of
a
horse
(
by
this
,
he
mean
Mr
Pecksniff
's
arab
steed
)
get
very
wet
;
and
that
he
rejoice
,
on
his
account
,
that
it
rain
so
fast
.
 
<EOS>
from
this
it
may
be
infer
that
Martin
's
spirit
have
not
improve
,
as
indeed
they
have
not
;
for
while
he
and
Mr
Pinch
stand
wait
under
a
hedge
,
look
at
the
rain
,
the
gig
,
the
cart
,
and
its
reek
driver
,
he
do
nothing
but
grumble
;
and
,
but
that
it
be
indispensable
to
any
dispute
that
there
should
be
two
party
to
it
<EOS>
,
he
would
certainly
have
pick
a
quarrel
with
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
the
noise
of
wheel
be
faintly
audible
in
the
distance
and
presently
the
coach
come
splash
through
the
mud
and
mire
with
one
miserable
outside
passenger
crouch
down
among
wet
straw
,
under
a
saturate
umbrella
;
and
the
coachman
,
guard
,
and
horse
,
in
a
fellowship
of
drip
wretchedness
.
 
<EOS>
immediately
on
its
stopping
,
Mr
Pecksniff
let
down
the
window
-
glass
and
hail
Tom
Pinch
.
   
<EOS>
"
dear
me
,
Mr
Pinch
!
 
<EOS>
be
it
possible
that
you
be
out
upon
this
very
inclement
morning
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
"
cry
Tom
,
advance
eagerly
,
"
Mr
Chuzzlewit
and
I
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
say
Mr
Pecksniff
,
look
not
so
much
at
Martin
as
at
the
spot
on
which
he
stand
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
do
me
the
favour
to
see
to
the
trunk
,
if
you
please
,
Mr
Pinch
.
"
   
<EOS>
then
Mr
Pecksniff
descend
,
and
help
his
daughter
to
alight
;
but
neighter
he
nor
the
young
lady
take
the
slight
notice
of
Martin
,
who
have
advance
to
offer
his
assistance
,
but
be
repulse
by
Mr
Pecksniff
's
stand
immediately
before
his
person
,
with
his
back
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
same
manner
,
and
in
profound
silence
,
Mr
Pecksniff
hand
his
daughter
into
the
gig
;
and
follow
himself
and
take
the
rein
,
drive
off
home
.
   
<EOS>
lose
in
astonishment
,
Martin
stand
stare
at
the
coach
,
and
when
the
coach
have
drive
away
,
at
Mr
Pinch
,
and
the
luggage
,
until
the
cart
move
off
too
;
when
he
say
to
Tom
:
   
"
now
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
tell
me
what
this
portend
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
what
?
"
ask
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
this
fellow
's
behaviour
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
's
,
I
mean
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
do
not
,
"
cry
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
busy
with
the
trunk
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
no
matter
,
"
say
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
!
 
<EOS>
let
us
make
haste
back
!
"
<EOS>
and
without
another
word
start
off
at
such
a
pace
,
that
Tom
have
some
difficulty
in
keep
up
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
no
care
where
he
go
,
but
walk
through
little
heap

straight
before

strange
manner
within
himself

<EOS>
Tom
feel
that
anything
he
could
say
would
only
render
him
the
more
obstinate
,
and
therefore
trust
to
Mr
Pecksniff
's
manner
when
they
reach
the
house
,
to
remove
the
mistaken
impression
under
which
he
feel
convinced
so
great
a
favourite
as
the
new
pupil
must
unquestionably
be
labour
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
not
a
little
amazed
himself
,
when
they
do
reach
it
,
and
enter
the
parlour
where
Mr
Pecksniff
be
sit
alone
before
the
fire
,
drink
some
hot
tea

to
find
that
instead

favourable
notice
of
his
relative
and
keep
him
,
Mr

in

he
do
exactly
the

so
lavish
in

"
   
<EOS>
Tom
see
that
Martin
look
at
Mr
Pecksniff
as
though
he
could
have
easily
find
it
in
his
heart
to
give
him
an
invitation
to
a
very
warm
place
;

quite
silent

him
attentively

be
so
perplex

dismay
that
he

the

<EOS>
in
this
awkward
interval

Mr

perfectly
conscious
of
Martin

gaze
,
though
he
have
never

when

round
the

Tom

<EOS>
Martin
look
at

,
and
make
no
answer
;
but
a
curious
observer
may
have
detect
an
ominous
twitching
at
his
mouth
,

perhaps
an
involuntary
attraction
of
his

direction
of
Mr

cravat

thus
much
more

I

<EOS>
this

I
weep
for
your

I
mourn
over

with

Martin
make
a
stride
forward
at

it

impossible

It
be
enough
to
know
that
Tom

catch
him
in
his
arm
,
and
that
,
at
the

moment
,
Mr
Pecksniff
step
back
so
hastily
,
that
he
miss
his
footing
,
tumble
over
a
chair
,
and
fall
in
a
sit
posture
on
the
ground
;
where
he
remain
without
an
effort
to
get
up
again
,
with
his

in

corner
,
perhaps
consider
it
the
safe
place

"
let

cry
Martin

shake

away

do
you
think
a
blow
could
make

a

he
be

do
you
think
that
if

spat

I

have

already
mention

on
the
carpet

with
his
head
in
an
acute
angle
of
the
wainscot
,

all
the
damage
and
detriment
of
an
uncomfortable
journey
about
him

be
not
exactly
a
model
of
all
that

prepossess

dignified
in

certainly

<EOS>
still

impossible
to
deprive
him
of

unique

paramount
appeal

he
return
Tom

point

show
what
become
of
martin
and
his
desparate
resolve
,
after
he
leave
Mr
Pecksniff
's
house
;
what
person
he
encounter
;
what
anxiety
he
suffer
;
and
what
news
he
hear
 
Carrying
Tom
Pinch
's
book
quite
unconsciously
under
his
arm
,
and
not
even
button
his
coat
as
a
protection
against
the
heavy
rain
,
Martin
go
doggedly
forward
at
the
same
quick
pace
,
until
he
have
pass
the
finger
-
post
,
and
be
on
the
high
road
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
He
slacken
very
little
in
his
speed
even
then
,
but
he
begin
to
think
,
and
look
about
him
,
and
to
disengage
his
sense
from
the
coil
of
angry
passion
which
hitherto
have
hold
them
prisoner
.
   
<EOS>
It
must
be
confess
that
,
at
that
moment
,
he
have
no
very
agreeable
employment
either
for
his
moral
or
his
physical
perception
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
be
dawn
from
a
patch
of
watery
light
in
the
east
,
and
sullen
cloud
come
drive
up
before
it
,
from
which
the
rain
descend
in
a
thick
,
wet
mist
.
 
<EOS>
It
stream
from
every
twig
and
bramble
in
the
hedge
;
make
little
gully
in
the
path
;
run
down
a
hundred
channel
in
the
road
;
and
punch
innumerable
hole
into
the
face
of
every
pond
and
gutter
.
 
<EOS>
It
fall
with
an
oozy
,
slushy
sound
among
the
grass
;
and
make
a
muddy
kennel
of
every
furrow
in
the
ploughed
field
.
 
<EOS>
no
live
creature
be
anywhere
to
be
see
.
 
<EOS>
the
prospect
could
hardly
have
be
more
desolate
if
animate
nature
have
be
dissolve
in
water
,
and
pour
down
upon
the
earth
again
in
that
form
.
   
<EOS>
the
range
of
view
within
the
solitary
traveller
be
quite
as
cheerless
as
the
scene
without
.
 
<EOS>
friendless
and
penniless
<EOS>
;
incensed
to
the
last
degree
;
deeply
wound
in
his
pride
and
self
-
love
;
full
of
independent
scheme
,
and
perfectly
destitute
of
any
mean
of
realize
them
;
his
most
vindictive
enemy
may
have
be
satisfied
with
the
extent
of
his
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
to
add
to
his
other
misery
,
he
be
by
this
time
sensible
of
be
wet
to
the
skin
,
and
cold
at
his
very
heart
.
   
<EOS>
in
this
deplorable
condition
he
remember
Mr
Pinch
's
book
;
more
because
it
be
rather
troublesome
to
carry
,
than
from
any
hope
of
be
comfort
by
that
part
gift
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
at
the
dingy
letter
on
the
back

He

on
the
point
of
throw
it
away
,
in
his
ill

humour
and
vexation

himself
that

to
a

turn
down
;
and
open
it
at
that
place
,
that
he
may
have
additional
cause
of
complaint
against
him
for
suppose

wisdom
could
cheer

well

<EOS>
not
much

but
Tom

all

<EOS>
the
half

<EOS>
He
have
wrap
it
hastily
in
a
piece
of
paper
,
and
pin
it
to
the
leaf
.
<EOS>
these
word
be
scrawl
in
pencil
on
the
inside
:
"
I
do
not
want
it
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
if
I
have
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
there
be
some
falsehood
,
Tom
,
on
which
man
mount
,
as
on
bright
wing
,
towards
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
some
truth
,
cold
bitter
taunting
truth
,
wherein
your
worldly
scholar
be
very
apt
and
punctual
,
which
bind
man
down
to

with
leaden
chain

<EOS>
who
would
not
rather
have
to
fan
him
,
in
his
die
hour
,
the
light
feather
of
a
falsehood
such
as
thine
,
than
all
the
quill
that
have
be
pluck
from
the
sharp
porcupine
,
reproachful
truth
,
since

!
   
<EOS>
Martin
feel
keenly
for
himself
,
and
he
feel
this
good
deed
of
Tom
's
keenly
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
few
minute
it
have
the
effect
of
raise
his
spirit
,
and
remind
him
that
he
be
not
altogether
destitute
,
as
he
have
leave
a
fair
stock
of
clothe
behind
him
,
and
wear
a
gold
hunting
-
watch
in
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
He
find
a
curious
gratification
,
too
,
in
think
what
a
win
fellow
he
must
be
to
have
make
such
an
impression
on
Tom
;
and
in
reflect
how
superior
he
be
to
Tom
;
and
how
much
more
likely
to
make
his
way
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
animate
by
these
thought
,
and
strengthen
in
his
design
of
endeavour
to
push
his
fortune
in
another
country
,
he
resolve
to
get
to
London
as
a
rallying
-
point
,
in
the
good
way
he
could
;
and
to
lose
no
time
about
it
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
ten
good
mile
from
the
village
make
illustrious
by
be
the
abide
-
place
of
Mr
Pecksniff
,
when
he
stop
to
breakfast
at
a
little
roadside
alehouse
;
and
rest
upon
a
high
-
back
settle
before
the
fire
,
pull
off
his
coat
,
and
hang
it
before
the
cheerful
blaze
to
dry
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
different
place
from
the
last
tavern
in
which
he
have
regale
;
boast
no
great
extent
of
accommodation
than
the
brick
-
floor
kitchen
yield
;
but
the
mind
so
soon
accommodate
itself
to
the
necessity
of
the
body
,
that
this
poor
waggoner
's
house
-
of
-
call
,
which
he
would
have
despise
yesterday
,
become
now
quite
a
choice
hotel
;
while
his
dish
of
egg
and
bacon
,
and
his
mug
of
beer
,
be
not
by
any
mean
the
coarse
fare
he
have
suppose
,
but
fully
bear
out
the
inscription
on
the
window
-
shutter
,
which
proclaim
those
viand
to
be
"
good
entertainment
for
traveller
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
push
away
his
empty
plate
;
and
with
a
second
mug
upon
the
hearth
before
him
,
look
thoughtfully
at
the
fire
until
his
eye
ache
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
look
at
the
highly
-
coloured
scripture
piece
on
the
wall
,
in
little
black
frame
like
common
shaving
-
glass
,
and
see
how
the
wise
Men
(
with
a
strong
family
likeness
among
them
)
worship
in
a
pink
manger
;
and
how
the
Prodigal
Son
come
home
in
red
rag
to
a
purple
father
,
and
already
feast
his
imagination
on
a
sea
-
green
calf
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
glance
through
the
window
at
the
fall
rain
,
come
down
aslant
upon
the
sign
-
post
over
against
the
house
,
and
overflow
the
horse
-
trough
;
and
then
he
look
at
the
fire
again
,
and
seem
to
descry
a
double
distant
London
,
retreat
among
the
fragment
of
the
burn
wood
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
repeat
this
process
in
just
the
same
order
,
many
time
,
as
if
it
be
a
matter
of
necessity
,
when
the
sound
of
wheel
call
his
attention
to
the
window
out
of
its
regular
turn
;
and
there
he
behold
a
kind
of
light
van
draw
by
four
horse
,
and
laden
,
as
well
as
he
could
see
(
for
it
be
cover
in
)
,
with
corn
and
straw
.
 
<EOS>
the
driver
,
who
be
alone
,
stop
at
the
door
to
water
his
team
,
and
presently
come
stamp
and
shake
the
wet
off
his
hat
and
coat
,
into
the
room
where
Martin
sit
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
a
red
-
faced
burly
young
fellow
;
smart
in
his
way
,
and
with
a
good
-
humoured
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
advance
towards
the
fire
he
touch
his
shine
forehead
with
the
forefinger
of
his
stiff
leather
glove
,
by
way
of
salutation
;
and
say
(
rather
unnecessarily
)
that
it
be
an
uncommon
wet
day
.
   
<EOS>
"
very
wet
,
"
say
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
as
ever
I
see
a
wetter

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never

say
Martin

<EOS>
the
driver
glance
at
Martin
's
soiled
dress
,
and
his
damp
shirt
-
sleeve
,
and
his
coat
hang
up
to
dry
;
and
say
,
after
a
pause
,
as
he
warm
his
hand
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
be
catch
in
it
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
be
the
short
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
out

,
maybe
?
"
say
the
driver
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
be

if
I
own

but
I
do
not

"
return
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
bad
,
"
say
the
driver
.
   
<EOS>
"
and
may
be
bad
,
"
say
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
now
the
driver
say
"
that
be
bad
,
"
not
so
much
because
Martin
do
not
own
a
horse
,
as
because
he
say
he
do
not
with
all
the
reckless
desperation
of
his
mood
and
circumstance
,
and
so
leave
a
great
deal
to
be
infer
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
whistle
when
he
have
retort
on
the
driver
;
thus
give
him
to
understand
that
he
do
not
care
a
pin
for
Fortune
;
that
he
be
above
pretend
to
be
her
favourite
when
he
be
not
;
and
that
he
snap
his
finger
at
her
,
the
driver
,
and
everybody
else
.
   
<EOS>
the
driver
look
at
him
stealthily
for
a
minute
or
so
;
and
in
the
pause
of
his
warming
whistle
too
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
he
ask
,
as
he
point
his
thumb
towards
the
road
.
   
<EOS>
"

"

Martin

<EOS>
He
toss
his
head
in
a
careless
manner
afterwards
,
as
if
he
would
have
add
,
"
now
you
know
all
about
it

<EOS>
"
put
his
hand
deeper
into
his
pocket

change
his
tune
,
and
whistle
a
little
louder
.
   
<EOS>
"

the

sprinkle

with

until

again
and
answer
,

"

Whereupon

in

I
would
not

a

much
less

for
no
consideration

the

another
thing
;

when
he
awake
,
find
it
have
cease

rain
,
he
take
his
seat
beside
the
driver
,
and
ask
him
several
question
;
as
how
long
have
the
fortunate
guard
of
the
Light
Salisbury
be
in
cross
the
Atlantic
;
at
what
time
of
the

the
ship
in
which
he

the
voyage

how
much

passage

money
;
do
he
suffer
greatly
from
sea
-
sickness
?
<EOS>
and
so
forth
.
 
<EOS>
but
on
these
point
of
detail
his
friend
be
possess
of
little
or
no
information
;
either
answer
obviously
at
random
or
acknowledge
that
he
have
never
hear
,
or
have
forget
;
nor
,
although
he
return
to
the
charge
very
often
,
could
he
obtain
any
useful
intelligence
on
these
essential
particular
.
   
<EOS>
They
jog
on
all
day
,
and
stop
so
often
---
now
to
refresh
,
now
to
change
their
team
of
horse
,
now
to
exchange
or
bring
away
a
set
of
harness
,
now
on
one
point
of
business
,
and
now
upon
another
,
connect
with
the
coaching
on
that
line
of
road
---
that
it
be
midnight
when
they
reach
Hounslow

<EOS>
a
little
short
of
the
stable
for
which
the
van
be
bind
,
Martin
get
down
,
pay
his
crown
,
and
force
his
silk
handkerchief
upon
his
honest
friend
,
notwithstanding
the
many
protestation
that
he
do
not
wish
to
deprive
him
of
it
,
with
which
he
try
to
give
the
lie
to
his
longing
look

<EOS>
that
do
,
they
part
company
;
and
when
the
van
have
drive
into
its
own
yard
and
the
gate
be
close
,
Martin
stand
in
the
dark
street
,
with
a
pretty
strong
sense
of
be
shut
out
,
alone
,
upon
the
dreary
world
,
without
the
key
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
but
in
this
moment
of
despondency
,
and
often
afterwards
,
the
recollection
of
Mr
Pecksniff
operate
as
a
cordial
to
him
;
awaken
in
his
breast
an
indignation
that
be
very
wholesome
in
nerve
him
to
obstinate
endurance
.
 
<EOS>
under
the
influence
of
this
fiery
dram
he
start
off
for
London
without
more
ado
.
 
<EOS>
arrive
there
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
and
not
know
where
to
find
a
tavern
open
,
he
be
fain
to
stroll
about
the
street
and
market
-
place
until
morning
.
   
<EOS>
He
find
himself
,
about
an
hour
before
dawn
,
in
the
humbler
region
of
the
Adelphi
;
and
address
himself
to
a
man
in
a
fur
-
cap
,
who
be
take
down
the
shutter
of
an
obscure
public
-
house
,
inform
him
that
he
be
a
stranger
,
and
inquire
if
he
could
have
a
bed
there
.
<EOS>
It
happen
by
good
luck
that
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
though
none
of
the
gaudy
,
it
be
tolerably
clean
,
and
Martin
feel
very
glad
and
grateful
when
he
creep
into
it
,
for
warmth
,
rest
,
and
forgetfulness
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
quite
late
in
the
afternoon
when
he
awake
;
and
by
the
time
he
have
wash
and
dress
,
and
break
his
fast
,
it
be
grow
dusk
again
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
all
the
well
,
for
it
be
now
a
matter
of
absolute
necessity
that
he
should
part
with
his
watch
to
some
oblige
pawn
-
broker
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
wait
until
after
dark
for
this
purpose
,
though
it
have
be
the
long
day
in
the
year
,
and
he
have
begin
it
without
a
breakfast
.
   
<EOS>
He
pass
more
Golden
Balls
than
all
the
juggler
in
Europe
have
juggle
with
,
in
the
course
of
their
united
performance
,
before
he
could
determine
in
favour
of
any
particular
shop
where
those
symbol
be
display
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
end
he
come
back
to
one
of
the
first
he
have
see
,
and
enter
by
a
side
-
door
in
a
court
,
where
the

in
a
ghastly
transparency
,
pass
into
one
of
a
series
of
little
closet
,
or
private
box
,
erect
for
the
accommodation
of
the
more
bashful
and
uninitiated
customer
.
 
<EOS>
He
bolt
himself
in
;
pull
out
his
watch
;
and
lay
it
on
the
counter
.
   
<EOS>
"

say
a
low
voice
in
the

to
the
shopman
who
be
in
treaty
with
him
,

you
go
one
way

"
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
allow
me
to
remind
you
,
sir

"
say
Mr
Tigg
,
with
sudden
dignity
,
"
that
you

not
I

<EOS>
that
you

I
say
emphatically
,
you

have
reduce
the
proceeding
of
this
evening
to
a
cold
and
distant
matter
of
business
,
when
I
be
dispose
to
place
them
on
a
friendly
footing
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
make
a
matter
of
business
,
sir
,
I
beg
to
say
that
I
expect
a
trifle
(
which
I
shall
bestow
in
charity
)
as
commission
upon
the
pecuniary
advance
,
in
which
I
have
render
you
my
humble
service

after
the
term
in
which
you
have
address
me

conclude
Mr

,
"
you
will
not
insult
me

if
you
please
,
by
offer
more
than
half

a

crown

"
   
<EOS>
Martin
draw
that
piece
of
money
from
his
pocket
,
and
toss
it
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tigg
catch
it
,
look
at
it
to
assure
himself
of
its
goodness
,
spin
it
in
the
air
after
the
manner
of
a
pieman
,
and
button
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
finally
,
he
raise
his
hat
an
inch
or
two
from
his
head
with
a
military
air
,
and
,
after
pause
a
moment
with
deep
gravity
,
as
to
decide
in
which
direction
he
should
go
,
and
to
what
Earl
or
Marquis
among
his
friend
he
should
give
the
preference
in
his
next
call
,
stick
his
hand
in
his
skirt
-
pocket
and
swagger
round
the
corner
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
take
the
directly
opposite
course
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
to
his
great
content
,
they
part
company
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
with
a
bitter
sense
of
humiliation
that
he
curse
,
again
and
again
,
the
mischance
of
have
encounter
this
man
in
the
pawnbroker
's
shop
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
comfort
he
have
in
the
recollection
be
,
Mr
Tigg
's
voluntary
avowal
of
a
separation
between
himself
and
Slyme
,
that
would
at
least
prevent
his
circumstance
(
so
Martin
argue
)
from
be
know
to
any
member
of
his
family
,
the
bare
possibility
of
which
fill
him
with
shame
and
wound
pride
.
 
<EOS>
abstractedly
there
be
great
reason
,
perhaps
,
for
suppose
any
declaration
of
Mr
Tigg
's
to
be
false
,
than
for
attach
the
least
credence
to
it
;
but
remember
the
term
on
which
the
intimacy
between
that
gentleman
and
his
bosom
friend
have
subsist
,
and
the
strong
probability
of
Mr
Tigg
's
have
establish
an
independent
business
of
his
own
on
Mr
Slyme
's
connection
,
it
have
a
reasonable
appearance
of
probability
;
at
all
event
,
Martin
hope
so
;
and
that
go
a
long
way
.
   
<EOS>
His
first
step
,
now
that
he
have
a
supply
of
ready
money
for
his
present
necessity
,
be
,
to
retain
his
bed
at
the
public
-
house
until
further
notice
,
and
to
write
a
formal
note
to
Tom
Pinch
(
for
he
know
Pecksniff
would
see
it
)
<EOS>
request
to
have
his
clothe
forward
to
London
by
coach
,
with
a
direction
to
be
leave
at
the
office
until
call
for
.
 
<EOS>
these
measure
take
,
he
pass
the
interval
before
the
box
arrive
---
three
day
---
in
make
inquiry
relative
to
american
vessel
,
at
the
office
of
various
shipping
-
agent
in
the
city
;
and
in
linger
about
the
dock
and
wharf
,
with
the
faint
hope
of
stumble
upon
some
engagement
for
the
voyage
,
as
clerk
or
supercargo
,
or
custodian
of
something
or
somebody
,
which
would
enable
him
to
procure
a
free
passage
.
 
<EOS>
but
finding
,
soon
,
that
no
such
mean
of
employment
be
likely
to
present
themselves
,
and
dread
the
consequence
of
delay
,
he
draw
up
a
short
advertisement
,
state
what
he
want
,
and
insert
it
in
the
lead
newspaper
.
 
<EOS>
pende
the
receipt
of
the
twenty
or
thirty
answer
which
he
vaguely
expect
,
he
reduce
his
wardrobe
to
the
narrow
limit
consistent
with
decent
respectability
,
and
carry
the
overplus
at
different
time
to
the
pawnbroker
's
shop
,
for
conversion
into
money
.
   
<EOS>
and
it
be
strange
,
very
strange
,
even
to
himself
,
to
find
how
,
by
quick
though
almost
imperceptible
degree
,
he
lose
his
delicacy
and
self
-
respect
,
and
gradually
come
to
do
that
as
a
matter
of
course
,
without
the
least
compunction
,
which
but
a
few
short
day
before
have
gall
him
to
the
quick
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
time
he
visit
the
pawnbroker
's
,
he
feel
on
his
way
there
as
if
every
person
whom
he
pass
suspect
whither
he
be
go
;
and
on
his
way
back
again
,
as
if
the
whole
human
tide
he
stem
,
know
well
where
he
have
come
from
.
 
<EOS>
when
do
he
care
to
think
of
their
discernment
now
!
 
<EOS>
in
his
first
wandering
up
and
down
the
weary
street
,
he
counterfeit
the
walk
of
one
who
have
an
object
in
his
view
;
but
soon
there
come
upon
him
the
sauntering
,
slipshod
gait
of
listless
idleness
,
and
the
lounging
at
street
-
corner
,
and
plucking
and
biting
of
stray
bit
of
straw
,
and
stroll
up
and
down
the
same
place
,
and
look
into
the
same
shop
-
window
,
with
a
miserable
indifference
,
fifty
time
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
,
he
come
out
from
his
lodging
with
an
uneasy
sense
of
be
observe
---
even
by
those
chance
passer
-
by
,
on
whom
he
have
never
look
before
,
and
hundred
to
one
would
never
see
again
---
 
issue
in
the
morning
from
a
public
-
house
;
but
now
,
in
his
coming
-
out
and
going
-
in
he
do
not
mind
to
lounge
about
the
door
,
or
to
stand
sun
himself
in
careless
think
beside
the
wooden
stem
,
stud
from
head
to
heel
with
peg
,
on
which
the
beer
-
pot
dangle
like
so
many
bough
upon
a
pewter

tree
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
it
take
but
<EOS>
five
week
to
reach
the
low
round
of
this
tall
ladder
!
   
<EOS>
oh
,
moralist
,
who
treat
of
happiness
and
self
-
respect
,
innate
in
every
sphere
of
life
,
and
shed
light
on
every
grain
of
dust
in
God
's
highway
,
so
smooth
below
your
carriage
-
wheel
,
so
rough
beneath
the

of
naked

,
bethink
yourself
in
look
on
the
swift
descent
of
man
who
have
live
in
their
own
esteem
,
that
there
be
score

and

thick
with
painful

who
in
that
high

have
never
live
at
all
,
nor
have
a

<EOS>
Go
ye

who
rest
so
placidly
upon
the
sacred
Bard
who
have
be
young
,
and
when
he
string
his

be
old

and
have
never
see
the

or
his

beg
their

teacher
of
content
and
honest

,
into
the
mine
,
the
mill
,
the
forge
,
the
squalid
depth
of
deep
ignorance
,
and
uttermost
abyss
of
man

neglect
,
and
say
can
any
hopeful
plant
spring
up
in

so
foul
that
it
extinguish
the

as

<EOS>
and
,
oh

ye
<EOS>
Pharisees
of
the
nineteen
hundredth
year
of
Christian
Knowledge
,
who
soundingly
appeal
to
human
nature
,
see
that
it
be
human
first
.
 
<EOS>
take
heed
it
have
not
be
transform
,
during
your
slumber
and
the
sleep
of
generation
,
into
the
nature
of
the
beast
!
   
<EOS>
five
week
!
 
<EOS>
of
all
the
twenty
or
thirty
answer
,
not
one
have
come
.
<EOS>
His
money
---
even
the
additional
stock
he
have
raise
from
the
disposal
of
his
spare
clothe
(
and
that
be
not
much
,
for
clothe
,
though
dear
to
buy
,
be
cheap
to
pawn
)
---
be
fast
diminish
.
 
<EOS>
yet
what
could
he
do
?
 
<EOS>
at
time
an
agony
come
over
him
in
which
he
dart
forth
again
,
though
he
be
but
newly
home
,
and
,
return
to
some
place
where
he
have
be
already
twenty
time
,
make
some
new
attempt
to
gain
his
end
,
but
always
unsuccessfully
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
year
and
year
too
old
for
a
cabin
-
boy
,
and
year
upon
year
too
inexperienced
to
be
accept
as
a
common
seaman
.
 
<EOS>
His
dress
and
manner
,
too
,
militate
fatally
against
any
such
proposal
as
the
latter
;
and
yet
he
be
reduce
to
make
it
;
for
even
if
he
could
have
contemplate
the
being
set
down
in
America
totally
without
money
,
he
have
not
enough
leave
now
for
a
steerage
passage
and
the
poor
provision
upon
the
voyage
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
an
illustration
of
a
very
common
tendency
in
the
mind
of
man
,
that
all
this
time
he
never
once
doubt
,
one
may
almost
say
the
certainty
of
do
great
thing
in
the
New
World
,
if
he
could
only
get
there
.
 
<EOS>
in
proportion
as
he
become
more
and
more
dejected
by
his
present
circumstance
,
and
the
mean
of
gain
America
recede
from
his
grasp
,
the
more
he
fret
himself
with
the
conviction
that
that
be
the
only
place
in
which
he
could
hope
to
achieve
any
high
end
,
and
worry
his
brain
with
the
thought
that
man
go
there
in
the
meanwhile
may
anticipate
him
in
the
attainment
of
those
object
which
be
dearest
to
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
He
often
think
of
John
Westlock
,
and
besides
look
out
for
him
on
all
occasion
,
actually
walk
about
London
for
three
day
together
for
the
express
purpose
of
meeting
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
although
he
fail
in
this
;
and
although
he
would
not
have
scruple
to
borrow
money
of
him
;
and
although
he
believe
that
John
would
have
lend
it
;
yet
still
he
could
not
bring
his
mind
to
write
to
Pinch
and
inquire
where
he
be
to
be
find
.
<EOS>
for
although
,
as
we
have
see
,
he
be
fond
of
Tom
after
his
own
fashion
,
he
could
not
endure
the
thought
(
feel
so
superior
to
Tom
)
of
make
him
the
stepping
-
stone
to
his
fortune
,
or
be
anything
to
him
but
a
patron
;
and
his
pride
so
revolt
from
the
idea
that
it
restrain
him
even
now
.
   
<EOS>
It
may
have
yield
,
however
;
and
no
doubt
must
have
yield
soon
,
but
for
a
very
strange
and
unlooked
-
for
occurrence
.
   
<EOS>
the
five
week
have
quite
run
out
,
and
he
be
in
a
truly
desperate
plight
,
<EOS>
when
one
evening
,
have
just
return
to
his
lodging
,
and
be
in
the
act
of
light
his
candle
at
the
gas
jet
in
the
bar
before
stalk
moodily
upstairs
to
his
own
room
,
his
landlord
call
him
by
his
name
.
 
<EOS>
now
as
he
have
never
tell
it
to
the
man
,
but
have
scrupulously
keep
it
to
himself
,
he
be
not
a
little
startled
by
this
;
and
so
plainly
show
his
agitation
that
the
landlord
,
to
reassure
him
,
say
"
it
be
only
a
letter
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
a
letter
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
for
Mr
Martin
Chuzzlewit
,
"
say
the
landlord
,
read
the
superscription
of
one
he
hold
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Noon
.
 
<EOS>
chief
office
.
<EOS>

"
   
<EOS>
Martin
take
it
from
him
,
thank
him
,
and
walk
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
seal
,
but
paste
close
;
the
handwriting
be
quite
unknown
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
open
it
and
find
enclose
,
without
any
name
,
address
,
or
other
inscription
or
explanation
of
any
kind
whatever
,
a
Bank
of
England
note
for
Twenty
Pounds
.
   
<EOS>
to
say
that
he
be
perfectly
stun
with
astonishment
and
delight
;
that
he
look
again
and
again
at
the
note
and
the
wrapper
;
that
he
hurry
below
stair
to
make
quite
certain
that
the
note
be
a
good
note
;
and
then
hurry
up
again
to
satisfy
himself
for
the
fiftieth
time
that
he
have
not
overlook
some
scrap
of
writing
on
the
wrapper
;
that
he
exhaust
and
bewilder
himself
with
conjecture
;
and
could
make
nothing
of
it
but
that
there
the
note
be
,
and
he
be
suddenly
enrich
;
would
be
only
to
relate
so
many
matter
of
course
to
no
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
the
final
upshot
of
the
business
at
that
time
be
,
that
he
resolve
to
treat
himself
to
a
comfortable
but
frugal
meal
in
his
own
chamber
;
and
have
order
a
fire
to
be
kindle
,
go
out
to
purchase
it
forthwith
.
   
<EOS>
He
buy
some
cold
beef
,
and
ham
,
and
french
bread
,
and
butter
,
and
come
back
with
his
pocket
pretty
heavily
laden
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
somewhat
of
a
damp
circumstance
to
find
the
room
full
of
smoke
,
which
be
attributable
to
two
cause
;
firstly
,
to
the
flue
be
naturally
vicious
and
a
smoker
;
and
secondly
,
to
their
have
forget
,
in
light
the
fire
,
an
odd
sack
or
two
and
some
trifle
,
which
have
be
put
up
the
chimney
to
keep
the
rain
out
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
already
remedie
this
oversight
,
however
;
and
prop
up
the
window
-
sash
with
a
bundle
of
firewood
to
keep
it
open
;
so
that
except
in
be
rather
inflammatory
to
the
eye
and
choke
to
the
lung
,
the
apartment
be
quite
comfortable
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
be
in
no
vein
to
quarrel
with
it
,
if
it
have
be
in
less
tolerable
order
,
especially
when
a
gleam
pint
of
porter
be
set
upon
the
table
,
and
the
servant
-
girl
withdrew
,
bear
with
her
particular
instruction
relative
to
the
production
of
something
hot
when
he
should
ring
the
bell
.
 
<EOS>
the
cold
meat
be
wrap
in
a
playbill
,
Martin
lay
the
cloth
by
spread
that
document
on
the
little
round
table
with
the
print
downwards
,
and
arrange
the
collation
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
which
be
very
close
to
the
fire
,
answer
for
a
sideboard
;
and
when
he
have
complete
these
preparation
,
he
squeeze
an
old
arm
-
chair
into
the
warm
corner
,
and
sit
down
to
enjoy
himself
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
begin
to
eat
with
great
appetite
,
glance
round
the
room
meanwhile
with
a
triumphant
anticipation
of
quit
it
for
ever
on
the
morrow
,
when
his
attention
be
arrest
by
a
stealthy
footstep
on
the
stair
,
and
presently
by
a
knock
at
his
chamber
door
,
which
,
although
it
be
a
gentle
knock
enough
,
communicate
such
a
start
to
the
bundle
of
firewood
,
that
it
instantly
leap
out
of
window
,

angrily

what

round

up

down

<EOS>
I
have
have
my
eye
upon

this

I

well
enough
there
be

loose

I

well
enough

you
down
at

now

here
be

without

I
save
up

I
do
not

do
it

I
could
not

it

at
the
Dragon

here
be
I
with
a
liking
for
what
be
wentersome
,
and
a
liking
for
you
,
and
a
wish
to
come
out
strong
under
circumstance
as
would
keep
other
man
down
;
and
will
you
take
me
,
or
will
you
leave
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
how
can
I
take
you
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Martin

<EOS>
"
when
I
say
take
,
"
rejoin
Mark
,
"
I
mean
will
you
let
me
go

when
I

will
you

I

will
you

go
along

for
go
<EOS>
I
will
,
somehow

another

<EOS>
now
that
you
have
say
America
<EOS>
,
I
see
clear
at
once
,
that
that
be
the
place
for
me
to
be
jolly
in

<EOS>
therefore
,
if
I
do
not
pay
my
own
passage
in
the
ship
you
go
in
,
sir
,
I
will
pay
my
own
passage
in
another
.
 
<EOS>
and
mark
my
word
,
if
I
go
alone
it
shall
be
,
to
carry
out
the
principle

in
the
rottenest

crazy
,
leaking
tub
of
a
wessel
that
a
place
can
be
get
in
for
love

money

so
if
I
be
lose
upon
the
way

there
will
be
a
drowned
man
at
your
door

always
a
-
knock
double
knock
at
it

too

never
trust
me

<EOS>
"
this
be
mere
folly

<EOS>
very
good

Mark

<EOS>

I
be
glad
to
hear
it

do
not

you
will
be
more
comfortable
,
perhaps
,
on

of
thinking
so

<EOS>
therefore
I
contradict
no
gentleman

all
I
say
be
,
that
if
I
do
not
emigrate
to
America
in
that
case

in
the
beastly
old
cockle

shell

go
out

You
do

yes
I
do

I
tell

"

very
good

Mark

with
the

air

perfect
satisfaction

let
it
stand
that
way
at

see
how
it
turn
out

<EOS>
why
,
love
my
heart
alive
!
<EOS>
the
only
doubt
I
have
be
,
whether
there
be
any
credit
in
go
with
a
gentleman
like
you
<EOS>
,
that
be
as
certain
to
make
his
way
there
as
a
gimlet

be
to
go
through
soft
deal

"
   
<EOS>
this
be
touch
Martin
on
his
weak
point
,
and
have
him
at
a
great
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
help
think
,
either
,
what
a
brisk
fellow
this
Mark
be
,
and
how
great
a
change
he
have
work
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
dismal
little
room
already
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
certainly
,
Mark
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
have
hope
of
do
well
there
,

I
should
not
go

<EOS>
I
may
have
the
qualification
for
do
well
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
of
course
you
have
,
sir

"
return
Mark
Tapley

<EOS>
"
everybody
know
that

<EOS>
"
You
see

Martin
,
lean
his
chin
upon
his
hand
,

look
at
the
fire

"
ornamental
architecture

to
domestic
purpose

can
hardly
fail

request

be
constantly
change
their
residence
there

move
further
off

it

clear
they
must
have
house
to

<EOS>

I
should
say
,

observe
Mark

that
that
be
a
state

open
one
of
the
jolly
look

out
for
domestic
architecture

ever
I
heerd
tell
on

<EOS>
Martin
glance
at
him
hastily
,
not
feel
quite
free
from
a
suspicion
that
this
remark
imply
a
doubt
of
the
successful
issue
of
his
plan
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mr
Tapley
be
eat
the
boil
beef
and
bread
with
such
entire
good
faith
and
singleness
of
purpose
express
in
his
visage
that
he
could
not
but
be
satisfied

<EOS>
another
doubt
arise
in
his
mind
however
,
as
this
one
disappear
.
 
<EOS>
He
produce
the
blank
cover
in
which
the
note
have
be
enclose
,
and
fix
his
eye
on
Mark
as
he
put
it
in
his
hand
,
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
now
tell
me
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
know
anything
about
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mark
turn
it
over
and
over
;
hold
it
near
his
eye
;
hold
it
away
from
him
at
arm
's
length
;
hold
it
with
the
superscription
upwards
and
with
the
superscription
downward
;
and
shake
his
head
with
such
a
genuine
expression
of
astonishment
at
be
ask
the
question
,
that
Martin
say
,
as
he
take
it
from
him
again
:
   
"
<EOS>
no
,
I
see
you
do
not

<EOS>
how
should
you
!
 
<EOS>
though
,
indeed
,
your
knowing
about
it
would
not
be
more
extraordinary
than
its
be
here
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
Tapley
,
"
he
add
,
after
a
moment
's
thought
,
<EOS>
"
I
will
trust
you
with
my
history
,
such
as
it
be
,
and
then
you
will
see
more
clearly
what
sort
of
fortune
you
would
link
yourself
to
,
if
you
follow
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
"
say
Mark
;
"
but
afore
you
enter
upon
it
will
you
take
me
if
I
choose
to
go
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
turn
off
me
---
Mark
Tapley
---
formerly
of
the
Blue
Dragon
,
as
can
be
well
recommend
by
Mr
Pinch
,
and
as
want
a
gentleman
of
your
strength
of
mind
to
look
up
to
;
or
will
you
,
in
climb
the
ladder
as
you
be
certain
to
get
to
the
top
of
,
take
me
along
with
you
at
a
respectful
dutance

<EOS>
now
,
sir

say
Mark
,
"
it
be
of
very
little
importance
to
you
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
difficulty
;
but
it
be
of
very
great
importance
to
me
,
and
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
consider
of
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
if
this
be
mean
as
a
second
appeal
to
Martin
's
weak
side
,
found
on
his
observation
of
the
effect
of
the
first
,
Mr
Tapley
be
a
skillful
and
shrewd
observer
.
 
<EOS>
whether
an
intentional
or
an
accidental
shot
,
it
hit
the
mark
fully
for
Martin
,
relent
more
and
more
,
say
with
a
condescension
which
be
inexpressibly
delicious
to
him
,
after
his
recent
humiliation
:
   
<EOS>
"
We
will
see
about
it

Tapley

You
shall
tell
me
in
what
disposition
you
find
yourself
to

morrow

"
   
<EOS>
"
then
,
sir

"
say
Mark
,
rub
his
hand
,
"
the
job
's
do
.
 
<EOS>
go
on
,
sir
,
if
you
please

<EOS>
I
be
all
attention
.
"
   
<EOS>
throw
himself
back
in
his
arm
-
chair
,
and
look
at
the
fire
,
with
now
and
then
a
glance
at
Mark
,
who
at
such
time
nod
his
head
sagely
,
to
express
his
profound
interest
and
attention
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
run
over
the
chief
point
in
his
history
,
to
the
same
effect
as
he
have
relate
them
,
week
before
,
to
Mr
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
adapt
them
,
accord
to
the
good
of
his
judgment
,
to
Mr
Tapley
's
comprehension
;
and
with
that
view
make
as
light
of
his
love
affair
as
he
could
,
and
refer
to
it
in
very
few
word
.
 
<EOS>
but
here
he
reckon
without
his
host
;
for
Mark
's
interest
be
keen
in
this
part
of
the
business
,
and
prompt
him
to
ask
sundry
question
in
relation
to
it
;
for
which
he
apologise
as

to
be
enable

night

just
as

house
be
close

with
the
welcome
intelligence
that
he
have
send
it
upstairs
to
the
young
lady

manuscript
of
his

petition
to

herself

that
she
would
meet
the

then
agree
between

that
Mark
should
be
in
wait
near
the
hotel
in
good
time
,
to
escort
the
young
lady
to
the
place
of
appointment
;
and
when
they
have
part
for
the
night
with
this
understanding
,
Martin
take
up
his
pen
again
;
and
before
he
go
to
bed
write
another
letter
,
whereof
more
will

It
be
raw

dismal

muddy

He
may
perhaps
have
go
on
to
reflect
that
of
all
morning
in

year
,
it
be
not
the
best
calculated
for
a
young

forth

either
.

he

stop
on

reflection

if
his

tend
that
way
,
by
her
appearance
at

short
distance
,
on
which
he
hurry
forward
to
meet
her

Her

Mr

discreetly
back

Martin

lover
be
such
a
singular
kind
of
people
that
this
be
all
they
do
say
just
then
,
though
Martin
take
her
arm
,

her
hand
too

they
pace
up

down
a
short
walk

<EOS>
"
if

Martin
at
length
,
as
he
look
upon
her
with
a
proud
delight
,
"
it
be
only
to
be
more
beautiful
than
ever

<EOS>
have
she
be
of
the
common
metal
of

young

would
have
deny

most
interesting
manner

would
have
tell
him
that
she
know
she
have
become
a
perfect
fright
;

that
she
have
waste
away
with
weeping
and
anxiety
;
or
that
she
be
dwindle
gently
into
an
early
grave
;

that
her
mental
suffering
be
unspeakable
;
or
would
,
either
by
tear
or
word
,
or
a
mixture
of
both
,
have
furnish
him
with
some
other
information
to
that
effect
,

make
him
as
miserable
as
possible

she
have
be
rear
up
in
a
sterner
school
than
the
mind
of

end

foreign
to
our

purpose
to
inquire

something
of
that
noble
quality
of
gentle
heart

be
develop
often
by
the
sorrow

struggle
of
matronly
year

often
by
their
lesson

unspoiled

unpampered
in
her
joy

griefs
;
with
frank
and
full
,
and
deep
affection
for
the
object
of
her
early
love
;
she
see
in
him
one
who
for
her
sake
be
an
outcast
from
his
home
and
fortune
,
and
she
have
no

that
love
upon
him
in
other
than
cheerful

full

remote

very
little

lessen

uneasiness

her

consolation

have
anybody

no

simple

with
whom
you
can
speak
about
me

the
very
first
time
you
talk
to

you
will
feel
at
once
that
there
be
no
more
occasion
for
any
embarrassment
or
hesitation
in
talk
to
him
,
than
if
he
be
an
old
woman

however

may
be

certainly

I
have
tell
him
in
so
many
word

we
will
always
take
notice

protect
him

you

laugh

I
think
you
will

him
a
little

much

<EOS>
however

that
be
neither
here

You

on
consideration

<EOS>
Mark
Tapley
know
it
perfectly
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
know
it
from
his
reading
,
perhaps
from
his
experience
,
perhaps
from
intuition
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
say
;
but
however
he
know
it
,
his
knowledge
instinctively
suggest
to
him
the
wise
course
of
proceed
that
any
man
could
have
adopt
under
the
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
take
with
a
violent
fit
of
sneezing
,
and
be
oblige
to
turn
his
head
another
way
.
 
<EOS>
in
do
which
,
he
,
in
a
manner
fence
and
screen
the
lover
into
a
corner
by
themselves
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
short
pause
,
but
Mark
have
an
undefined
sensation
that
it
be
a
satisfactory
one
in
its
way
.
 
<EOS>
then
Mary
,
with
her
veil
lower
,
pass
him
with
a
quick
step
,
and
beckon
him
to
follow
.
<EOS>
She
stop
once
more
before
they
lose
that
corner
;
look
back
;
and
wave
her
hand
to
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
a
start
towards
them
at
the
moment
as
if
he
have
some
other
farewell
word
to
say
;
but
she
only
hurry
off
the
faster
,
and
Mr
Tapley
follow
as
in
duty
bind
.
   
<EOS>
when
he
rejoin
Martin
again
in
his
own
chamber
,
he
find
that
gentleman
seat
moodily
before
the
dusty
grate
,
with
his
two
foot
on
the
fender
,
his
two
elbow
on
his
knee

and

in

breath

the
young
lady
safe

after
it

this
,

it

us
do
him
justice

be
for

little
finger

her
this
now

<EOS>
Mark
Tapley
know
as
well
that
she
have
buy
it
,
to
the
end
that
that
unconscious
speaker
may
carry
some
article
of
sterling
value
with
him
in
his
necessity
;
as
he
know
that
it
be
day
,
and
not
night
.
 
<EOS>
though
he
have
no
more
acquaintance
of
his
own
knowledge
with
the
history
of
the
glitter
trinket
on
Martin
's
outspread
finger
,
than
Martin
himself
have
,
he
be
as
certain
that
in
its
purchase
she
have
expend
her
whole
stock
of
hoard
money
,
as
if
he
have
see
it
pay
down
coin
by
coin
.
 
<EOS>
Her
lover
's
strange
obtuseness
in
relation
to
this
little
incident
,
promptly
suggest
to
Mark
's
mind
its
real
cause
and
root
;
and
from
that
moment
he
have
a
clear
and
perfect
insight
into
the
one
absorb
principle
of
Martin
's
character
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
be
worthy
of
the
sacrifice
I
have
make
,
"
say
Martin
,
fold
his
arm
,
and
look
at
the
ashe
in
the
stove
,
as
if
in
resumption
of
some
former
thought
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
worthy
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
no
riches
"
<EOS>
---
here
he
stroke
his
chin
and
muse
---
"
could
have
compensate
for
the
loss
of
such
a
nature
.
 
<EOS>
not
to
mention
that
in
gain
her
affection
I
have
follow
the
bent
of
my
own
wish
,
and
baulk
the
selfish
scheme
of
other
who
have
no
right
to
form
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
quite
worthy
---
more
than
worthy
---
of
the
sacrifice
I
have
make
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
she
be
.
 
<EOS>
no
doubt
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
these
rumination
may
or
may
not
have
reach
Mark
Tapley
;
for
though
they
be
by
no
means
address
to
him
,
yet
they
be
softly
uttered
.
 
<EOS>
in
any
case
,
he
stand
there
,
watch
Martin
with
an
indescribable
and
most
involved
expression
on
his
visage
,
until
that
young
man
rouse
himself
and
look
towards
him
;
when
he
turn
away
,
as
be
suddenly
intent
upon
certain
preparation
for
the
journey
,
and
,
without
give
vent
to
any
articulate
sound
,
smile
with
surpass
ghastliness
,
and
seem
by
a
twist
of
his
feature
and
a
motion
of
his
lip
,
to
release
himself
of
this
word
:
   
"
jolly
!

Hither

a
thousand
mile
away

so
quietly
in

angry

hither

them

the
blast
from
unknown
desert
place

here

in

into

Pursuit

incessant

up

they

dreadful

high

themselves

It

Martin
be

far
go

as
much

sickness
as

that
he
have
a
peculiar
faculty

knock
himself
about
on
the
small
provocation
,

lose
his
leg
at
every
lurch
of
the
ship

resolve

in
his
usual
phrase
,
to
"
come
out
strong

under
disadvantageous
circumstance

he
be
the
life
and
soul
of
the
steerage

make
no
more
of
stop
in
the
middle
of
a
facetious
conversation

go
away

be
excessively
ill
by
himself

afterwards

involuntarily

close

sallow
gentleman

with
sunken
cheek
,
black
hair
,
small
twinkle

and
a
singular
expression
hover
about
that
region
of
his
face
,
which
be
not
a
frown
,
nor
a
leer
,
and
yet
may
have
be
mistake
at

<EOS>
indeed
it
would
have
be
difficult
,
on
a
much
close
acquaintance
,
to
describe
it
in
any
more
satisfactory
term
than
as
a
mixed
expression
of
vulgar
cunning
and
conceit
.
 
<EOS>
this
gentleman
wear
a
rather
broad

brim
hat
for
the
great
wisdom
of
his
appearance

and
have
his
arm
fold
for
the
great
impressiveness
of
his
attitude

He

somewhat
shabbily
dress
in
a
blue
surtout
reach
nearly
to
his
ankle
,
short
loose
trouser
of
the

colour

and
a
fade
buff
waistcoat
,
through
which
a
discolour
shirt

frill
struggle
to
force
itself
into
notice
,
as
assert
an
equality
of
civil
right
with
the
other
portion

maintain
a
declaration
of
Independence
on

own
account
.
 
<EOS>
His
foot
,
which
be
of
unusually
large

,
be
leisurely
cross
before
him
as
he
half
lean
against

<EOS>
half
sit
upon

the

into

aspect

up

hand
corner
of

mouth

his

eye
simultaneously

once

such
sign

He
point
to
the
vessel
lie
at
the
wharf

and
then
give
a
vague
flourish
with
his
stick
,
as
if
he
would
include
the
air

water
,
generally
,
in

remark

really

glance

him
as

observe
the
prejudice

of

"
the

two
longer

"
say
Martin
with
a
smile
,
partly
occasion
by
what
the
gentleman
say

and
partly
by
his
manner
of
say
it

which
be
odd
enough
for
he
emphasise
all
the
small
word

syllable
in

discourse

leave

to
take
care

themselves

<EOS>
the
colonel
,
who
have
walk
the
whole
way
with
one
hand
in
his
breast
,
his
head
occasionally
wag
from
side
to
side
,
and
his
hat
throw
back
upon
his
ear
,
like
a
man
who
be
oppress

by
a
sense
of
his

lead

<EOS>
behind
a
mangy
old
writing

table
in
this
apartment
sit
a
figure
with
a
stump
of
a
pen
in
its
mouth
and
a
great
pair
of
scissor
in
its
right
hand
,
clip
and
slice
at
a
file
of
Rowdy
Journals
;
and
it
be
such
a
laughable
figure
that
Martin
have
some
difficulty
in
preserve
his
gravity
,
though
conscious
of
the
close
observation
of
Colonel
Diver
.
   
<EOS>
the
individual
who
sit
clip
and
slicing
as
aforesaid
at
the
Rowdy
Journals
,
be
a
small
young
gentleman
of
very
juvenile
appearance
,
and
unwholesomely
pale
in
the
face
;
partly
,
perhaps
,
from
intense
thought
,
but
partly
,
there
be
no
doubt
,
from
the
excessive
use
of
tobacco
,
which
he
be
at
that
moment
chew
vigorously
.
 
<EOS>
He
wear
his
shirt
-
collar
turn
down
over
a
black
ribbon
;
and
his
lank
hair
,
a
fragile
crop
,
be
not
only
smooth
and
part
back
from
his
brow
,
that
none
of
the
Poetry
of
his
aspect
may
be
lose
,
but
have
,
here
and
there
,
be
grub
up
by
the
root
;
which
account
for
his
lofty
development
be
somewhat
pimply
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
that
order
of
nose
on
which
the
envy
of
mankind
have
bestow
the
appellation
"
snub
,
"
and
it
be
very
much
turn
up
at
the
end
,
as
with
a
lofty
scorn
.
 
<EOS>
upon
the
upper
lip
of
this
young
gentleman
be
token
of
a
sandy
down
;
so
very
,
very
smooth
and
scant
,
that
,
though
encourage
to
the
utmost
,
it
look
more
like
a
recent
trace
of
gingerbread
than
the
fair
promise
of
a
moustache
;
and
this
conjecture
,
his
apparently
tender
age
go
far
to
strengthen
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
intent
upon
his
work
.
 
<EOS>
every
time
he
snap
the
great
pair
of
scissor
,
he
make
a
corresponding
motion
with
his
jaw
,
which
give
him
a
very
terrible
appearance
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
be
not
long
in
determine
within
himself
that
this
must
be
Colonel
Diver
's
son
;
the
hope
of
the
family
,
and
future
mainspring
of
the
Rowdy

<EOS>
indeed
he
have
begin
to
say
that
he
presume
this
be
the
colonel
's
little
boy
,
and
that
it
be
very
pleasant
to
see
him
play
at
Editor
in
all
the
guilelessness
of
childhood
,
when
the
colonel
proudly
interpose
and
say
:
   
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
Martin
could
not
help
start
at
this
unexpected
announcement
,
and
the
consciousness
of
the
irretrievable
mistake
he
have
nearly
make
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Brick
seem
pleased
with
the
sensation
he
produce
upon
the
stranger
,
and
shake
hand
with
him
,
with
an
air
of
patronage
design
to
reassure
him
,
and
to
let
him
blow
that
there
be
no
occasion
to
be
frightened
,
for
he
(
Brick

would
not
hurt
him

take

when

<EOS>
rightly
interpret
this
as
the
signal
for
their
departure

Martin
walk
downstairs
after
the
war
correspondent

who
precede
him
with
great
majesty

<EOS>
the
colonel
follow
,
they
leave
the
Rowdy
Journal
Office
and
walk
forth
into
the
street
;
Martin
feel
doubtful
whether
he
ought
to
kick
the
colonel
for
have
presume
to
speak
to
him
,
or
whether
it
come
within
the
bound
of
possibility
that
he
and
his
establishment
could
be
among
the
boasted
usage
of
that
regenerate
land
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
clear
that
Colonel
Diver
,
in
the
security
of
his
strong
position
,
and
in
his
perfect
understanding
of
the
public
sentiment
,
care
very
little
what
Martin
or
anybody
else
think
about
him
.
<EOS>
His
high
-
spice
ware
be
make
to
sell
,
and
they
sell
;
and
his
thousand
of
reader
could
as
rationally
charge
their
delight
in
filth
upon
him
,
as
a
glutton
can
shift
upon
his
cook
the
responsibility
of
his
beastly
excess
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
would
have
delight
the
colonel
more
than
to
be
tell
that
no
such
man
as
he
could
walk
in
high
success
the
street
of
any
other
country
in
the
world
;
for
that
would
only
have
be
a
logical
assurance
to
him
of
the
correct
adaptation
of
his
labour
to
the
prevail
taste
,
and
of
his
be
strictly
and
peculiarly
a
national
feature
of
America

<EOS>
They
walk
a
mile
or
more
along
a
handsome
street
which
the
colonel
say
be
call
Broadway
,
and
which
Mr
Jefferson
Brick
say
"
whip
the

<EOS>
Turning
,
at
length
,
into
one
of
the
numerous
street
which
branch
from
this
main
thoroughfare
,
they
stop
before
a
rather
mean

looking
house

flight

green

knock
at

<EOS>
Martin
take

that

may

with
a

I

<EOS>
"
I

the

<EOS>
He
say
so
with
a
stoical
indifference
certainly
,
but
still
in
a
tone
of
firmness
which
admit
of
no
further
dispute
on
that
point
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
thus
settle
the
question
,
he
put
his

a
little
on
one
side
for
the
great
convenience
of
scratch
his
head
,
and
salute
Mr

with
a
lazy
nod

<EOS>
Major
Pawkins
(
a
gentleman
of
pennsylvanian
origin
)
be
distinguish
by
a
very
large
skull
,
and
a
great
mass
of
yellow
forehead
;
in
deference
to
which
commodity
it
be
currently
hold
in
bar
-
room
and
other
such
place
of
resort
that
the
major
be
a
man
of
huge
sagacity
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
further
to
be
know
by
a
heavy
eye
and
a
dull
slow
manner
;
and
for
be
a
man
of
that
kind
who
---
mentally
speak
---
require
a
deal
of
room
to
turn
himself
in
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
in
trading
on
his
stock
of
wisdom
,
he
invariably
proceed
on
the
principle
of
put
all
the
good
he
have
(
and
more
)
into
his
window
;
and
that
go
a
great
way
with
his
constituency
of
admirer
.
<EOS>
It
go
a
great
way
,
perhaps
,
with
Mr
Jefferson
Brick
,
who
take
occasion
to
whisper
in
Martin
's
ear
:
   
<EOS>
"
one
of
the
most
remarkable
man
in
our
country
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
suppose
,
however
,
that
the
perpetual
exhibition
in
the
market
-
place
of
all
his
stock
-
in
-
trade
for
sale
or
hire
,
be
the
major
's
sole
claim
to
a
very
large
share
of
sympathy
and
support
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
great
politician
;
and
the
one
article
of
his
creed
,
in
reference
to
all
public
obligation
involve
the
good
faith
and
integrity
of
his
country
,
be
,
"
run
a
moist
pen
slick
through
everything
,
and
start
fresh
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
make
him
a
patriot
.
 
<EOS>
in
commercial
affair
he
be
a
bold
speculator
.
 
<EOS>
in
plainer
word
he
have
a
most
distinguished
genius
for
swindling
,
and
could
start
a
bank
,
or
negotiate
a
loan
,
or
form
a
land
-
job
company
(
entail
ruin
,
pestilence
,
and
death
,
on
hundred
of
family
)
,
with
any
gifted
creature
in
the
Union
.
 
<EOS>
this
make
him
an
admirable
man
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
hang
about
a
bar
-
room
,
discuss
the
affair
of
the
nation
,
for
twelve
hour
together
;
and
in
that
time
could
hold
forth
with
more
intolerable
dulness
,
chew
more
tobacco
,
smoke
more
tobacco
,
drink
more
rum
-
toddy
,
mint
-
julep
,
gin
-
sling
,
and
cocktail
,
than
any
private
gentleman
of
his
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
this
make
him
an
orator
and
a
man
of
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
the
major
be
a
rise
character
,
and
a
popular
character
,
and
be
in
a
fair
way
to
be
send
by
the
popular
party
to
the
State
House
of
New
York
,
if
not
in
the
end
to
Washington
itself
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
a
man
's
private
prosperity
do
not
always
keep
pace
with
his
patriotic
devotion
to
public
affair
;
and
as
fraudulent
transaction
have
their
down
as
well
as
up
,
the
major
be
occasionally
under
a
cloud
.
 
<EOS>
hence
,
just
now
Mrs
Pawkins
keep
a
boarding
-
house
,
and
major
pawkin
rather
"
loaf
"
his
time
away
than
otherwise
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
come

know
perfectly
well
that
if
its

believe

it
always
be
depressed

and
always
be
stagnate

and
always
be
at
an
alarming
crisis

and
never
be
otherwise

though
as
a
body
they
be
ready

make
oath
upon
the

at
any
hour
of
the
day

night

It

"
say
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well

"
return
the
major
,
"
<EOS>
I
expect
we
shall
get
along
somehow
,
and
come
right
in
the
end

"
   
<EOS>
"
We
be
an

<EOS>
"
We

Mr

<EOS>
"
We
have
revivify

vigorous
principle
within
ourselves

"
observe
the
major
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
drink
a
bitter
afore
dinner
,
colonel
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
colonel
assent
to
this
proposal
with
great
alacrity
,
Major
Pawkins
propose
an
adjournment
to
a
neighbour
bar
-
room
,
which
,
as
he
observe
,
be
"
only
in
the
next
block

"
 
<EOS>
He
then
refer
Martin
to
Mrs
Pawkins
for
all
particular
connect
with
the
rate
of
board
and
lodging
,
and
inform
him
that
he
would
have
the
pleasure
of
see
that
lady
at
dinner
,
which
would
soon
be
ready
,
as
the
dinner
hour
be
two
o'clock
,
and
it
only
want
a
quarter
now
.
 
<EOS>
this
remind
him
that
if
the
bitter
be
to
be
take
at
all
,
there
be
no
time
to
lose
;
so
he
walk
off
without
more
ado
,
and
leave
them
to
follow
if
they
think
proper
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
major
rise
from
his
rocking
-
chair
before
the
stove
,
and
so
disturb
the
hot
air
and
balmy
whiff
of
soup
which
fan
their
brow
,
the
odour
of
stale
tobacco
become
so
decidedly
prevalent
as
to
leave
no
doubt
of
its
proceeding
mainly
from
that
gentleman
's
attire
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
as
Martin
walk
behind
him
to
the
bar
-
room
,
he
could
not
help
think
that
the
great
square
major
,
in
his
listlessness
and
langour
,
look
very
much
like
a
stale
weed
himself
;
such
as
may
be
hoe
out
of
the
public
garden
,
with
great
advantage
to
the
decent
growth
of
that
preserve
,
and
toss
on
some
congenial
dunghill
.
   
<EOS>
They
encounter
more
weed
in
the
bar
-
room
,
some
of
whom
(
be
thirsty
soul
as
well
as
dirty
)
be
pretty
stale
in
one
sense
,
and
pretty
fresh
in
another
.
 
<EOS>
among
them
be
a
gentleman
who
,
as
Martin
gather
from
the
conversation
that
take
place
over
the
bitter
,
start
that
afternoon
for
the
Far
West
on
a
six
month
'
business
tour
,
and
who
,
as
his
outfit
and
equipment
for
this
journey
,
have
just
such
another
shiny
hat
and
just
such
another
little
pale
valise
as
have
compose
the
luggage
of
the
gentleman
who
come
from
England
in
the
Screw
.
   
<EOS>
They
be
walk
back
very
leisurely
;
Martin
arm
-
in

arm
with
Mr
Jefferson
Brick
,
and
the
major
and
the
colonel
side
-
by

side
before
them
;
when
,
as
they
come
within
a
house
or
two
of
the
major
's
residence
,
they
hear
a
bell
ring
violently
.
 
<EOS>
the
instant
this
sound
strike
upon
their
ear
,
the
colonel
and
the
major
dart
off
,
dash
up
the
step
and
in
at
the
street
-
door
(
which
stand
ajar
)
like
lunatic
;
while
Mr
Jefferson
Brick
,
detach
his
arm
from
Martin
's
,
make
a
precipitate
dive
in
the
same
direction
,
and
vanish
also
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
Heaven

Martin

<EOS>
"
the

be
on
fire

It

bell

but
there
be
no
smoke
to
be
see
,
nor
any
flame
,
nor
be
there
any
smell
of
fire

<EOS>
as
Martin
falter
on
the
pavement
,
three
more
gentleman
,
with
horror
and
agitation
depict
in
their
face
,
come
plunge
wildly
round
the
street
corner
;
jostle
each
other
on
the
step
;
struggle
for
an
instant
;
and
rush
into
the
house
,
a
confused
heap
of
arm
and
leg
.
 
<EOS>
unable
to
bear
it
any
longer
,
Martin
follow
.
 
<EOS>
even
in
his
rapid
progress
he
be
run
down
,
thrust
aside
,
and
pass
,
by
two
more
gentleman
,
stark
mad
,
as
it
appear
,
with
fierce
excitement
.
   
<EOS>
"
where
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Martin
,
breathlessly
,
to
a
negro
whom
he
encounter
in
the
passage

<EOS>
Martin
start
at
him
for
a
moment
,
and
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
;
to
which
the
negro
,
out
of
his
natural
good
humour
and
desire
to
please
,
so
heartily
respond
,
that
his
tooth
shine

<EOS>
"
You

"
say
Martin
clap
him
on
the
back
,
"
and
give
me
a
well
appetite

bitter
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
with
this
sentiment
he
walk
into
the
dining
-
room
and
slip
into
a
chair
next
the
colonel
,
which
that
gentleman
(
by
this
time
nearly
through
his
dinner
)
have
turn
down
in
reserve
for
him
,
with
its
back
against
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
numerous
company
---
eighteen
or

there

"
   
<EOS>
pursue
his
inquiry
Martin
find
that
there
be
no
few
than
four
major
present
,
two
colonel
,
one
general
,
and
a
captain
,
so
that
he
could
not
help
think
how
strongly
officer
the
american
militia
must
be
;
and
wonder
very
much
whether
the
officer
command
each
other
;
or
if
they
do
not
,
where
on
earth
the
private
come
from

<EOS>
there
seem
to
be
no
man
there
without

for
those
who
have
not
attain
to
military
honour
be
either
doctor

professor
,
or
reverend
.
 
<EOS>
three
very
hard
and
disagreeable
gentleman
be
on
mission
from
neighbour
States
;
one
on
monetary
affair
,
one
on
political
,
one
on
sectarian
.
 
<EOS>
among
the
lady
,
there
be
Mrs
Pawkins
,
who
be
very
straight
,
bony
,
and
silent
;
and
a
wiry

face
old
damsel
,
who
hold
strong
sentiment
touch
the
right
of
woman
,
and
have
diffuse
the
same
in
lecture
;
but
the
rest
be
strangely
devoid
of
individual
trait
of
character
,
<EOS>
insomuch
that
any
one
of
them
may
have
change
mind
with
the
other
,
and
nobody
would
have
find
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
these
,
by
the
way
,
be
the
only
member
of
the
party
who
do
not
appear
to
be
among
the
most
remarkable
people
in
the
country
.
   
<EOS>
several
of
the
gentleman
get
up
,
one
by
one
,
and
walk
off
as
they
swallow
their
last
morsel
;
pause
generally
by
the
stove
for
a
minute
or
so
to
refresh
themselves
at
the
brass
spittoon

<EOS>
a
few
sedentary

however

remain
at
table
full
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
do
not
rise
until
the
lady
rise
,
when
all
stand
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
where
be
they
go
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Martin
,
in
the
ear
of
Mr
Jefferson
Brick

<EOS>
"
to
their
bedroom
,
sir

"
   
"
be
there
no
dessert

or
other
interval
of
conversation

"
<EOS>
ask
Martin
,
who
be
dispose
to
enjoy
himself
after
his
long
voyage
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
be
a
busy
people
here
,
sir

and
have
no
time
for
that

"
be
the
reply

<EOS>
so
the
lady
pass
out
in
single
file
;
Mr
Jefferson
Brick
and
such
other
married
gentleman
as
be
leave
,
acknowledge
the
departure
of
their
other
half
by
a
nod
;
and
there
be
an
end
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
think
this
an
uncomfortable
custom
,
but
he
keep
his
opinion
to
himself
for
the
present
,
be
anxious
to
hear
,
and
inform
himself
by
,
the
conversation
of
the
busy
gentleman
,
who
now
lounge
about
the
stove
as
if
a
great
weight
have
be
take
off
their
mind
by
the
withdrawal
of
the
other
sex
;
and
who
make
a
plentiful
use
of
the
spittoon
and
their
toothpick
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
rather
barren
of
interest
,
to
say
the
truth
;
and
the
great
part
of
it
may
be
sum
up
in
one
word
.
 
<EOS>
dollar
.
 
<EOS>
all
their
care
,
hope
,
joy
,
affection
,
virtue
,
and
association
,
seem
to
be
melt
down
into
dollar
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
the
chance
contribution
that
fall
into
the
slow
cauldron
of
their
talk
,
they
make
the
gruel
thick

slab

<EOS>
man

<EOS>
the
next
respectable

to

be
any
venture
have
their
attainment
for
its
end

<EOS>
the
more

worthless

honour
and
fair

dealing

which
any

cast
overboard
from

the
more
ample

he

<EOS>
make
commerce
one
huge
lie
and
mighty
theft
.
 
<EOS>
Deface
<EOS>
the
banner
of
the
nation
for
an
idle
rag
;
pollute
it
star
by
star
;
and
cut
out
stripe

from
the
arm
of
a
degraded

<EOS>
do
anything
for

<EOS>
one

will
prefer

ride
recklessly
at

time

<EOS>
so
it
be
with
these
gentleman

<EOS>
He
be
the
great
patriot

in
their
eye

who
brawl
the
loud

who
care
the

for
decency

<EOS>
He
be
their
champion
who
,
in
the
brutal
fury
of
his
own
pursuit
,
could
cast
no
stigma
upon
them
for
the
hot
knavery
of
theirs
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
Martin
learn
in
the
five
minute
'
straggle
talk
about
the
stove
,
that
to
carry
pistol
into
legislative
assembly
,
and
sword
in
stick
,
and
other
such
peaceful
toy
;
to
seize
opponent
by
the
throat
,
as
dog
or
rat
may
do
;
to
bluster
,
bully
,
and
overbear
by
personal
assailment

be
glow
deed

<EOS>
not
thrust
and
stab
at
freedom
,
strike
far
deeper
into

House
of

but
rare

and
curl
upward

of
Fame

<EOS>
once
or
twice
,
when
there
be
a
pause
,
Martin
ask
such
question
as
naturally
occur
to
him
,
be
a
stranger
,
about
the
national
poet
,
the
theatre
,
literature
,
and
the
art
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
information
which
these
gentleman
be
in
a
condition
to
give
him
on
such
topic
,
do
not
extend
beyond
the
effusion
of
such
master
-
spirit
of
the
time
as
Colonel
Diver
,
Mr
Jefferson
Brick
,
and
other
;
renowne

as
it
appear

for
excellence

the
achievement

peculiar

broadside
essay
call
"
a

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
be
a
busy

say
one
of
the
captain

who
be
from
the
West
,
"
and
have
no
time
for
read
mere
notion

<EOS>
We
do
not
mind
'em
if
they
come
to
us
in
newspaper
along
with
almighty
strong
stuff
of
another
sort
,
but
darn
your
book
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
here
the
general
,
who
appear
to
grow
quite
faint
at
the
bare
thought
of
read
anything
which
be
neither
mercantile
nor
political
,
and
be
not
in
a
newspaper
,
inquire
"
if
any
gentleman
would
drink
some
?
"
 
<EOS>
Most
of
the
company
,
consider
this
a
very
choice
and
seasonable
idea
,
lounge
out
,
one
by
one
,
to
the
bar
-
room
in
the
next
block
.
 
<EOS>
Thence
<EOS>
they
probably
go
to
their
store
and
counting
-
house
;
thence
to
the
bar
-
room
again
,
to
talk
once
more
of
dollar
,
and
enlarge
their
mind
with
the
perusal
and
discussion
of
screamer
;
and
thence
each
man
to
snore
in
the
bosom
of
his
own
family
.
   
<EOS>
"
which
would
seem
,
"
say
Martin
,
pursue
the
current
of
his
own
thought
,
"
to
be
the
principal
recreation
they
enjoy
in
common
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
with
that
,
he
fall
a
-
musing
again
on
dollar
,
demagogue
,
and
bar
-
room
;
debate
within
himself
whether
busy
people
of
this
class
be
really
as
busy
as
they
claim
to
be
,
or
only
have
an
inaptitude
for
social
and
domestic
pleasure
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
difficult
question
to
solve
;
and
the
mere
fact
of
its
be
strongly
presented
to
his
mind
by
all
that
he
have
see
and
hear
,
be
not
encouraging
.
 
<EOS>
He
sit
down
at
the
deserted
board
,
and
become
more
and
more
despondent
,
as
he
think
of
all
the
uncertainty
and
difficulty
of
his
precarious
situation
,
sigh
heavily
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
there
have
be
at
the
dinner
-
table
a
middle
-
aged
man
with
a
dark
eye
and
a
sunburnt
face
,
who
have
attract
Martin
's
attention
by
have
something
very
engaging
and
honest
in
the
expression
of
his
feature
;
but
of
whom
he
could
learn
nothing
from
either
of
his
neighbour
,
who
seem
to
consider
him
quite
beneath
their
notice
.
<EOS>
He
have
take
no
part
in
the
conversation
round
the
stove
,
nor
have
he
go
forth
with
the
rest
;
and
now
,
when
he
hear
Martin
sigh
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
,
he
interpose
with
some
casual
remark
,
as
if
he
desire
,
without
obtrude
himself
upon
a
stranger
's
notice
,
to
engage
him
in
cheerful
conversation
if
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
His
motive
be
so
obvious
,
and
yet
so
delicately
express
,
that
Martin
feel
really
grateful
to
him
,
and
show
him
so
in
the
manner
of
his
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
ask
you
,
"
say
this
gentleman
with
a
smile
,
as
he
rise
and
move
towards
him
,
"
how
you
like
my
country
,
for
I
can
quite
anticipate
your
feeling
on
that
point
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
be
an
American
,
and
consequently
bind
to
begin
with
a
question
,
I
will
ask
you
how
you
like
the
colonel
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
so
very
frank
,
"
return
Martin
,
"
that
I
have
no
hesitation
in
say
I
do
not
like
him
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
though
I
must
add
that
I
be
behold
to
him
for
his
civility

there
be
a

candour

an
engage
confidence
that
it

not

abuse

a
manly
bearing

<EOS>
Martin
enlarge
his
circle
of
aquaintance
;
increase
his
stock
of
wisdom
;
and
have
an
excellent
opportunity
of
compare
his

experience
with
those
of
Lummy
Ned
of
the
Light
Salisbury
,
as
relate
by

It

characteristic
of

either
forget
Mark

completely

have
be
no

if
for

that
gentleman

dismiss
it
as
something
by
no

be
now
in

within

possibility
that
Mr

may

in

of
time

grow
tired
of

on
the
threshold

impertinence

hearted

good

natured

prepossessing

kind

plainly

what
have
bring
him
into
those
part

even
make
the
very
difficult
avowal

he
be
poor

<EOS>
He
do
not

how
poor
,
it
must
be
admit

rather
throw
off
the
declaration
with
an
air

imply

he
have
money
enough

he
would
make
it
matter
of
immediate
consideration

inquiry
where

then
he
make
Martin
acquaint

the

no

<EOS>
Martin
call
to
him
immediately
to
be
of
their
party

so
Cicero

the
truck

one
way

they
three
go
another

They
walk
about
the
city

two

three
hour

see
it
from
the
good
point

pause
in
the
principal
street
,
and
before
such
public
building
as
Mr
Bevan
point
out

<EOS>
Night
then
come
on
apace

Martin
propose
that
they

establishment

in
this
he

overrule
by
his
new
acquaintance

who
seem
to
have
set
his
heart
on
carry
him
,
though
it
be
only
for
an
hour
,
to
the
house
of
a
friend
of
his
who
live
hard
by

<EOS>
feel
(
however
disincline
he
be
,
be
weary
)
that
it
would
be
in
bad
taste
,
and
not
very
gracious
,
to
object
that
he
be
unintroduced
,
when
this
open
-
hearted
gentleman
be
so
ready
to
be
his
sponsor
,
Martin
---
for
once
in
his
life

at
all
event

sacrifice
his
own
will

pleasure
to
the
wish
of
another

consent
with
a
fair
grace

so
travel

do
him
that
much
good

already

Mr

neat
house

moderate
size

from
the
parlour
window

light

brightly
into
the
now
dark
street

<EOS>
It
be
quickly
open
by
a
man
with
such
a
thoroughly
irish
face
,
that
it
seem
as
if
he
ought
,
as
a
matter
of
right
and
principle
,
to
be
in
rag
,
and
could
have
no

cheerfully

<EOS>
commend
Mark

Mr

the
pleasure
to
make

They
give
him
welcome
in

courtesy
and
politeness

in
less
than
five
minute
'
time
he
find
himself
sit
very
much
at
his
ease
by
the
fireside
,
and
become
vastly
well
acquaint
with
the
whole
family
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
two
young
lady
---
one
eighteen
;
the
other
twenty
---
both
very
slender
,
but
very
pretty
;
their
mother
,
who
look
,
as
Martin
think
much
old
and
more
faded
than
she
ought
to
have
look
;
and
their
grandmother
,
a
little
sharp
-
eyed
,
quick
old
woman
,
who
seem
to
have
get
past
that
stage
,
and
to
have
come
all
right
again
.
<EOS>
besides
these
,
there
be
the
young
lady
'
father
,
and
the
young

brother
;
the
first
engage
in
mercantile
affair
;
the
second
,
a
student
at
college
;
both
,
in
a
certain
cordiality
of
manner
,
like
his
own
friend
,
and
not
unlike
him
in
face
.
 
<EOS>
which
be
no
great
wonder
,
for
it
soon
appear
that
he
be
their
near
relation
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
could
not
help
trace
the
family
pedigree
from
the
two
young
lady
,
because
they
be
foremost
in
his
thought
;
not
only
from
be
,
as
aforesaid
,
very
pretty
,
but
by
reason
of
their
wear
miraculously
small
shoe
,
and
the
thin
possible
silk
stocking
;
the
which
their
rocking
-
chair
develop
to
a
distracting
extent
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
that
it
be
a
monstrous
comfortable
circumstance
to
be
sit
in
a
snug
,
well
-
furnish
room
,
warm
by
a
cheerful
fire
,
and
full
of
various
pleasant
decoration
,
include
four
small
shoe
,
and
the
like
amount
of
silk
stocking

and
---
yes
,
why
not
?
---
<EOS>
the
foot
and
leg
therein
enshrine
.
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
no
doubt
that
Martin
be
monstrous
well
-
dispose
to
regard
his
position
in
that
light
,
after
his
recent
experience
of
the
Screw
,
and
of
Mrs
Pawkins
's
boarding
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
the
consequence
be
that
he
make
himself
very
agreeable
indeed
;
and
by
the
time
the
tea
and
coffee
arrive
(
with
sweet
preserve
,
and
cunne
tea
-
cake
in
its
train
)
,
be
in
a
highly
genial
state
,
and
much
esteem
by
the
whole
family
.
   
<EOS>
another
delightful
circumstance
turn
up
before
the
first
cup
of
tea
be
drunk
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
family
have
be
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
pleasant
thing
!
 
<EOS>
but
Martin
be
not
quite
so
glad
of
this
,
when
he
find
that
they
know
all
the
great
duke
,
lord
,
viscount
,
marquess
,
duchess
,
knight
,
and
baronet
,
quite
affectionately
,
and
be
beyond
everything
interested
in
the
least
particular
concern
them
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
when
they
ask
,
after
the
wearer
of
this
or
that
coronet
,
and
say
,
"
be
he
quite
well
?
"
<EOS>
Martin
answer
,
"
<EOS>
yes
,
oh
yes
.
 
<EOS>
never
better
;
"
and
when
they
say
,
"
his
lordship
's
mother
,
the
duchess
,
be
she
much
changed
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Martin
say
,
"
oh
dear
<EOS>
no
,
they
would
know
her
anywhere
,
if
they
see
her
to
-
morrow
;
"
and
so
get
on
pretty
well
.
 
<EOS>
in
like
manner
when
the
young
lady
question
him
touch
the
Gold
Fish
in
that
grecian
fountain
in
such
and
such
a
nobleman
's
conservatory
,
and
whether
there
be
as
many
as
there
use
to
be
,
he
gravely
report
,
after
mature
consideration
,
that
there
must
be
at
least
twice
as
many
;
and
as
to
the
exotic
,
"
oh
!
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
it
be
of
no
use
talk
about
them
;
they
must
be
see
to
be
believe
;
"
which
improve
state
of
circumstance
remind
the
family
of
the
splendour
of
that
brilliant
festival
(
comprehend
the
whole
British
Peerage
and
Court
Calendar
)
to
which
they
be
specially
invite
,
and
which
indeed
have
be
partly
give
in
their
honour
;
and
recollection
of
what
Mr
Norris
the
father
have
say
to
the
marquess
,
and
of
what
Mrs
Norris
the
mother
have
say
to
the
marchioness
,
and
of
what
the
marquess
and
marchioness
have
both
say
,
when
they
say
that
upon
their
word
and
honour
they
wish
Mr
Norris
the
father
and
Mrs
Norris
the
mother
,
and
the
Misses
Norris
the
daughter
,
and
Mr
Norris
Junior
,
the
son
,
would
only
take
up
their
permanent
residence
in
England
,
and
give
them
the
pleasure
of
their
everlasting
friendship
,
occupy
a
very
considerable
time
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
think
it
rather
stange
,
and
in
some
sort
inconsistent
,
that
during
the
whole
of
these
narration
,
and
in
the
very
meridian
of
their
enjoyment
thereof
,
both
Mr
Norris
the
father
,
and
Mr
Norris
Junior
,
the
son
(
who
correspond
,
every
post
,
with
four
member
of
the
English
Peerage
)
,
enlarge
upon
the
inestimable
advantage
of
have
no
such
arbitrary
distinction
in
that
enlighten
land
,
where
there
be
no
nobleman
but
nature
's
nobleman
,
and
where
all
society
be
base
on
one
broad
level
of
brotherly
love
and
natural
equality
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
Mr
Norris
the
father
gradually
expand
into
an
oration
on
this
swell
theme
,
be
become
tedious
,
when
Mr
Bevan
divert
his
thought
by
happen
to
make
some
causal
inquiry
relative
to
the
occupier
of
the
next
house
;
in
reply
to
which
,
this
same
Mr
Norris
the
father
observe
,
that
"
that
person
entertain
religious
opinion
of
which
he
could
not
approve
;
and
therefore
he
have
not
the
honour
of
know
the
gentleman
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Norris
the
mother
add
another
reason
of
her
own
,
the
same
in
effect
,
but
vary
in
word
;
to
wit
,
that
she
believe
the
people
be
well
enough
in
their
way
,
but
they
be
not
genteel
.
   
<EOS>
another
little
trait
come
out
,
which
impress
itself
on
Martin
forcibly
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bevan
tell
them
about
Mark
and
the
negro
,
and
then
it
appear
that
all
the
Norrises
be
abolitionist
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
relief
to
hear
this
,
and
Martin
be
so
much
encourage
on
find
himself
in
such
company
,
that
he
express
his
sympathy
with
the
oppressed
and
wretched
black
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
one
of
the
young
lady
---
the
prettiest
and
most
delicate
---
be
mightily
amuse
at
the
earnestness
with
which
he
speak
;
and
on
his
craving
leave
to
ask
her
why
,
be
quite
unable
for
a
time
to
speak
for
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
however
as
she
could
,
she
tell
him
that
the
negro
be
such
a
funny
people
,
so
excessively
ludicrous
in
their
manner
and
appearance
,
that
it
be
wholly
impossible
for
those
who
know
them
well
,
to
associate
any
serious
idea
with
such
a
very
absurd
part
of
the
creation
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Norris
the
father
,
and
Mrs
Norris
the
mother
,
and
Miss
Norris
the
sister
,
and
Mr
Norris
Junior
the
brother
,
and
even
Mrs
Norris
Senior
the
grandmother
,
be
all
of
this
opinion
,
and
lay
it
down
as
an
absolute
matter
of
fact
---
as
if
there
be
nothing
in
suffering
and
slavery
,
grim
enough
to
cast
a
solemn
air
on
any
human
animal
;
though
it
be
as
ridiculous
,
physically
,
as
the
most
grotesque
of
ape
,
or
morally
,
as
the
mild
Nimrod
among
tuft
-
hunt
republicans
!
   
<EOS>
"
in
short
,
"
say
Mr
Norris
the
father
,
settle
the
question
comfortably
,
"
there
be
a
natural
antipathy
between
the
race
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
extending
,
"
say
Martin
's
friend
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
to
the
cruell
of
torture
,
and
the
bargain
and
sale
of
unborn
generation
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Norris
the
son
say
nothing
,
but
he
make
a
wry
face
,
and
dust
his
finger
as
Hamlet
may
after
get
rid
of
Yorick
's
skull
;
just
as
though
he
have
that
moment
touch
a
negro
,
and
some
of
the
black
have
come
off
upon
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
in
order
that
their
talk
may
fall
again
into
its
former
pleasant
channel
,
Martin
drop
the
subject
,
with
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
it
would
be
a
dangerous
theme
to
revive
under
the
good
of
circumstance
;
and
again
address
himself
to
the
young
lady
,
who
be
very
gorgeously
attire
in
very
beautiful
colour
,
and
have
every
article
of
dress
on
the
same
extensive
scale
as
the
little
shoe
and
the
thin
silk
stocking
.
 
<EOS>
this
suggest
to
him
that
they
be
great
proficient
in
the
french
fashion
,
which
soon
turn
out
to
be
the
case
,
for
though
their
information
appear
to
be
none
of
the
new
,
it
be
very
extensive
;
and
the
eld
sister
in
particular
,
who
be
distinguish
by
a
talent
for
metaphysic
,
the
law
of
hydraulic
pressure
,
and
the
right
of
human
kind
,
have
a
novel
way
of
combine
these
acquirement
and
bring
them
to
bear
on
any
subject
from
Millinery
to
the
Millennium
,
both
inclusive
,
which
be
at
once
improve
and
remarkable
;
so
much
so
,
in
short
,
that
it
be
usually
observe
to
reduce
foreigner
to
a
state
of
temporary
insanity
in
five
minute
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
feel
his
reason
go
;
and
as
a
means
of
save
himself
,
besought
the
other
sister
(
see
a
piano
in
the
room
)
to
sing
.
<EOS>
with
this
request
she
willingly
comply
;
and
a
bravura
concert
,
solely
sustain
by
the
Misses
Noriss
,
presently
begin
.
 
<EOS>
They
sing
in
all
language
---
except
their
own
.
 
<EOS>
german
,
french
,
italian
,
spanish
,
portuguese
,
swiss
;
but
nothing
native
;
nothing
so
low
as
native
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
in
this
respect
,
language
be
like
many
other
traveller
---
ordinary
and
commonplace
enough
at
home
,
but
"
specially
genteel
abroad
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
little
doubt
that
in
course
of
time
the
Misses
Norris
would
have
come
to
Hebrew
,
if
they
have
not
be
interrupt
by
an
announcement
from
the
Irishman
,
who
,
fling
open
the
door
,
cry
in
a
loud
voice
---
    
"
Jiniral
Fladdock
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
!
"
cry
the
sister
,
desist
suddenly
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
general
come
back
!
"
   
<EOS>
as
they
make
the
exclamation
,
the
general
,
attire
in
full
uniform
for
a
ball
,
come
dart
in
with
such
precipitancy
that
,
hitch
his
boot
in
the
carpet
,
and
get
his
sword
between
his
leg
,
he
come
down
headlong
,
and
present
a
curious
little
bald
place
on
the
crown
of
his
head
to
the
eye
of
the
astonished
company
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
this
the
bad
of
it
;
for
be
rather
corpulent
and
very
tight
,
the
general
be
down
,
could
not
get
up
again
,
but
lie
there
write
and
do
such
thing
with
his
boot
,
as
there
be
no
other
instance
of
in
military
history
.
   
<EOS>
of
course
there
be
an
immediate
rush
to
his
assistance
;
and
the
general
be
promptly
raise
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
uniform
be
so
fearfully
and
wonderfully
make
,
that
he
come
up
stiff
and
without
a
bend
in
him
like
a
dead
Clown
,
and
have
no
command
<EOS>
whatever
of
himself
until
he
be
put
quite
flat
upon
the
sol
of
his
foot
,
when
he
become
animate
as
by
a
miracle
,
and
move
edgewise
that
he
may
go
in
a
narrow
compass
and
be
in
less
danger
of
fray
the
gold
lace
on
his
epaulette
by
brush
them
against
anything
,
advance
with
a
smile
visage
to
salute
the
lady
of
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
it
would
have
be
impossible
for
the
family
to
testify
purer
delight
and
joy
than
at
this
unlooke
-
for
appearance
of
General
Fladdock
!
 
<EOS>
the
general
be
as
warmly
receive
as
if
New

have
be
in
a
state
of
siege
and
no

<EOS>
He
shake
hand
with
the
Norrises
three
time
all
round
,
and
then
review
them
from
a
little
distance
as
a
brave
commander
may
,
with
his
ample
cloak
draw
forward
over
the
right
shoulder

throw
back
upon
the
left
side
to
reveal
his
manly
breast

<EOS>
"

do
I

cry

"
once

"

"
say
Mr

the

<EOS>
"
here
we

then
all
the
Norrises
press
round
the
general
,
inquire
how

where
he
have
be
since
the

of
his

and
how

off

these

,
Fladdock

Fladdock

expect
to
know
a
fellow
who
have
come
over
in
the
steerage
of
line
-
of
-
packet
ship
,
at
the
cost
of
four
pound
ten
!
 
<EOS>
and
meeting
that
fellow
in
the
very
sanctuary
of
New
York
fashion
,
and
nestle
in
the
bosom
of
the
New
York
aristocracy
!
 
<EOS>
He
almost
lay
his
hand
upon
his
sword

a
death

like
stillness

upon
the
Norisses

if

should
get
wind

their
country

,
by
his
imprudence
,
for
ever
disgrace
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
the
bright
particular
star
of
an
exalted
New

sphere
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
other
fashionable
sphere
above
them

other

and
none

one
of
these

have
anything
to
say
to
the
star
in
any
other
of

<EOS>
but
,
through
all
the
sphere
it
would
go
forth
that
the
Norrises
,
deceive
by
gentlemanly
manner
and
appearance
,
have
,
fall
from
their
high
estate
,
"

"
a
dollarless
and
unknown
man

<EOS>
o
guardian
eagle
of

pure
Republic

have
they
live
for
this

<EOS>
"
You
will
allow
me
,
"
say
Martin
,
after
a
terrible
silence
,
"
to
take
my
leave
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
be
the
cause
of
at
least
as
much
embarrassment
here
,
as
I
have
bring
upon
myself
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
bind
,
before
I
go
,
to
exonerate
this
gentleman

who
,
in
introduce
me
to
such
society

be
quite
ignorant
of
my
unworthiness
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
with
that
he
make
his
bow
to
the
Norrises
,
and
walk
out
like
a
man
of
snow
;
very
cool
externally
,

pretty
hot
within

<EOS>
"
come

come

Mr
Norris
the

look
with

pale

Martin
close
the
door
<EOS>
,
"
the
young
man
have
this
night
beheld
a
refinement
of
social
manner

and
an
easy
magnificence
of
social
decoration
,
to
which
he
be
a
stranger
in
his
own
country

<EOS>
let
us
hope
it
may
awake
a
moral
sense
within
him

<EOS>

transatlantic

America

monopolise
the

if
that
peculiarly
transatlantic
article
be
suppose
to
include
a
benevolent
love
of
all
mankind

certainly
Martin

would
have
bear
,
just
then
,
<EOS>
a
deal
of
wake
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
stride
along
the
street
,
with
Mark
at
his
heel
,
his
immoral
sense
be
in
active
operation
;
prompt
him
to
the
utterance
of
some
rather
sanguinary
remark
,
which
it
be
well
for
his
own
credit
that
nobody
overhear
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
so
far
cool
down
,
however
,
that
he
have
begin
to
laugh
at
the
recollection
of
these
incident
,
when
he
hear
another
step
behind
him
,
and
turn
round
encounter
his
friend
Bevan
,
quite
out
of
breath
.
   
<EOS>
He
draw
his
arm
through
Martin
's
,
and
entreat
him
to
walk
slowly
,
be
silent
for
some
minute
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
he
say
:
   
<EOS>

you
exonerate

how
do
you

I
hope
you
acquit
me

dare

resume
his

you
may
have
such
a

indeed

doubtless
it

I
may
add
that
I
be
perfectly
aware
from
the

I

Martin

<EOS>
neither
he
nor
his

anything
more
on
the
way
back

each
appear
to

sufficient

they
call

at

out

these

all
three

together
in

loud
tone
when
Martin

his

see
those
gentleman
,
they
stop
directly
,

become
excessively
genteel

not

frosty

<EOS>
as
they
go
on

exchange
some

remark
in
whisper

the

water

twenty

here
the
lady
on

Mrs

give
a
pious
cough
as
much
as
to

I

as

indeed

nearly
every

<EOS>
the
lady
raise
her
eye
in
a
pious

yes

<EOS>
She
have
be
much
comfort

strong

peppery

satisfactorily
dispose

"
   
<EOS>
Martin
stop
here
,
for
he
see
that
the
lady
regard
him
with
no
very
great
favour
,
though
what
he
have
do
to
deserve
the
disdainful
expression
which
appear
in
their
face
<EOS>
he
be
at
a
loss
to
divine
.
<EOS>
but
on
their
go
upstairs
to
their
bedroom
---
which
they
very
soon
do
---
Mr
Bevan
inform
him
that
domestic
drudgery
be
far
beneath
the
exalted
range
of
these
Philosophers
,
and
that
the
chance
be
a
hundred
to
one
that
not
one
of
the

could
perform
the
easy
woman

work

simple
article

child

though
whether

better

with

tool

"
he
say
,
"
be
another
question
;
but
I
can
answer
for
one
thing
---
they
do
not
often
cut
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
devotion
and
lecture
be
our
ball
and
concert

<EOS>
They
go
to
these
place
of
resort

as
an
escape
from
monotony
;
look
at
each

and
come
home
again

when
you

you
mean

very

you
be
tired

will
wish
you
good

<EOS>
We
will
discuss
your

You

They
shake

heartily

separate

<EOS>
as
soon

the
excitement
of
novelty
and
change
which
have
sustain
him
through
all
the
fatigue
of
the
day

depart

upstairs

<EOS>
in
twelve

fifteen
hour
,
how
great
a
change
have
fall
on
his
hope

sanguine
plan

<EOS>
new
and
strange
as
he
be
to
the
ground
on

he
stand
,

to
the
air

breathe

he
could
not

recall
all
that
he
have
crowd
into
that
one
day

but
entertain
a
strong
misgiving
that
his
enterprise
be
doom

<EOS>
Rash
and
ill
-
consider
as
it
have
often
look
on
shipboard
,
but
have
never
seem
on
shore
<EOS>
,
it
wear
a
dismal
aspect

now

that
frighten
him

<EOS>
whatever
thought
he
call
up
to
his
aid
,
they
come
upon
him
in
depress

discouraging
shape

give
him
no
relief

<EOS>
even
the
diamond
on
his

sparkle
with
the
brightness
of
tear

and
have
no
ray
of
hope
in
all
their
brilliant
lustre

<EOS>
He
continue
to
sit
in
gloomy
rumination
by
the
stove
,
unmindful
of
the
boarder
who
drop
in
one
by
one
from
their
store
and
counting

house

or
the
neighbour
bar

room

and
,
after
take
long
pull
from
a
great
white
waterjug
upon
the
sideboard
,
and
linger
with
a
kind
of
hideous
fascination
near
the
brass
spittoon
,
lounge
heavily
to
bed
;
until
at
length
Mark
Tapley
come
and
shake
him
by
the
arm
,
suppose
him
asleep

<EOS>
"
Mark

"
   
<EOS>
"
I

blinder
,
too

the
old
man
,
shake
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
a

Chuffey

<EOS>
You

well
before

"
   
<EOS>
He
pat
Anthony
upon
the
hand
as
one
may
comfort
a
child
,
and
draw
the
old
man
's
arm
still
further
through
his
own
,
shake
his
tremble
finger
towards
the
spot
where
Jonas
sit
,
as
though
he
would
wave
him
off
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
Anthony
remain
quite
still
and
silent
,
he
relax
his
hold
by
slow
degree
and
lapse
into
his
usual
niche
in
the
corner
;
merely
put
forth
his
hand
at
interval
and
touch
his
old
employer
gently
on
the
coat
,
as
with
the
design
of
assure
himself
that
he
be
yet
beside
him
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
be
so
very
much
amazed
by
these
proceeding
that
he
could
do
nothing
but
stare
at
the
two
old
man
,
until
Chuffey
have
fall
into
his
usual
state
,
and
Anthony
have
sink
into
a
doze
;
when
he
give
some
vent
to
his
emotion
by
go
close
up
to
the
former
personage
,
and
make
as
though
he
would
,
in
vulgar
parlance
,
"
punch
his
head
.

"
   
<EOS>
"
They
have
be
carry
on
this
game
,
"
think
Jonas
in
a
brown
study
,
"
for
the
last
two
or
three
week
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
my
father
take
so
much
notice
of
him
as
he
have
in
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
what
!
 
<EOS>
You
be
legacy
hunting
,
be
you
,
Mister
Chuff
?
 
<EOS>
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
but
Chuffey
be
as
little
conscious
of
the
thought
as
of
the
bodily
advance
of
Mr
Jonas
's
clenched
fist
,
which
hover
fondly
about
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
scowl
at
him
to
his
heart
's
content
,
Jonas
take
the
candle
from
the
table
,
and
walk
into
the
glass
office
,
produce
a
bunch
of
key
from
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
with
one
of
these
he
open
a
secret
drawer
in
the
desk
;
peep
stealthily
out
,
as
he
do
so
,
to
be
certain
that
the
two
old
man
be
still
before
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
all
as
right
as
ever
,
"
say
Jonas
,
prop
the
lid
of
the
desk
open
with
his
forehead
,
and
unfold
a
paper
.
 
<EOS>
"
here
be
the
will

You

<EOS>
You
will
not

anything

<EOS>
what
be
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
startling
,
certainly
.
 
<EOS>
a
face
on
the
other
side
of
the
glass
partition
look
curiously
in
;
and
not
at
him

at
the
paper
in

<EOS>
for
the
eye
be
attentively
cast
down
upon

be
swiftly
raise
when
he
cry
out

<EOS>
then
they
meet
his
own
,

be
as
the
eye
of
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
suffer
the
lid
of
the
desk
to
fall
with
a
loud
noise
,

not
forget
even
then
to
lock
it

Jonas
,
pale
and
breathless
,
gaze
upon
this
phantom

It
move

in

up

It

I
be
curious

he
add
in
his
gentle
way

he
lay
his

upon

young
man

shoulder

"
to
find

in
haste
at

well

It

so

be

poetry

Mr

shake
the
forefinger

how
the

do
you
come
to

Ecod

it

enough

who
he

the
combined

of
the
shaking

remonstrance
soon
awake

give
Mr

as
Mr

out
to
keep

promise
to

pray
tell
me
what
I

a
dummy

Mr

with
his
sweetest
smile

and
his
head
very
much
on
one
side

He

why

Mr

I

excellent
quality

,
previously
rise
to
see
that
the
door
be
shut
,
and
arrange
his
chair
when
he
come
back
,
so
that
it

not

open
in

without
his
immediately
become
aware

circumstance

you
should
do
me
the
honour
to
wish

take
counsel

me

but
that
you
should
desire
to
do
so

to
the
exclusion
even
of
Mr

show
an
amount
of
confidence
in
one

you
have
do
a
verbal
injury

merely
a
verbal
injury

repair

<EOS>
He
be
always
a
glib
speaker
,
but
he
deliver
this
short
address
very
glibly
;
have
be
at
some
pain
to
compose
it
outside
the
coach
.
   
<EOS>
although
he
pause
for
a
reply
,
and
truly
say
that
he
be
there
at
Anthony
's
request
,
the
old
man
sit
gaze
at
him
in
profound
silence
and
with
a
perfectly
blank
face
.
 
<EOS>
nor
do
he
seem
to
have
the
least
desire
or
impulse
to
pursue
the
conversation
,
though
Mr
Pecksniff
look
towards
the
door
,
and
pull
out
his
watch
,
and
give
him
many
other
hint
that
their
time
be
short
,
and
Jonas
,
if
he
keep
his
word
,
would
soon
return
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
strange
incident
in
all
this
strange
behaviour
be
,
that
of
a
sudden
,
in
a
moment
,
so
swiftly
that
it
be
impossible
to
trace
how
,
or
to
observe
any
process
of
change
,
his
feature
fall
into
their
old
expression
,
and
he
cry
,
strike
his
hand
passionately
upon
the
table
as
if
no
interval
at
all
have
take
place
:
   
"
<EOS>
Will
you
hold
your
tongue
,
sir
,

let
me
speak
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
defer
to
him
with
a
submissive
bow
;
and
say
within
himself
,
"
I
know
his

be
change

and
that

stagger

I

"
Jonas

the

in

tone

"
We
speak
of

You

loud

retort
Anthony

<EOS>
"
I
be
not

deaf

that

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
have
certainly
raise
his
voice
pretty
high
;
not
so
much
because
he
think
Anthony
be
deaf
,
as
because
he
feel
convinced
that
his
perceptive
faculty
be
wax
dim
;
but
this
quick
resentment
of
his
considerate
behaviour
greatly
disconcert
him
,
and
,
not
know
what
tack
to
shape
his
course
upon
,
he
make
another
inclination
of
the
head
,
yet
more
submissive
that
the
last

<EOS>

I
have
say

repeat
the

cry
the
old
man
,
advance
his
weazen
face
at

a
yard

start
forward
in
his
chair
to
do
it

His

alter
so
horribly

really

fain

look

up
a
scrap
of
morality
from
the
great
storehouse
within
his
own
breast
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
he
stammer
out
that
no
doubt
it
be
,
in
fairness
and
decency
,
Mr
Chuffey
's
turn
to
expire
;
and
that
from
all
he
have
hear
of
Mr
Chuffey
,
and
the
little
he
have
the
pleasure
of
know
of
that
gentleman
,
personally
,
he
feel
convinced
in
his
own
mind
that
he
would
see
the
propriety
of
expire
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
.
   
<EOS>
"
come
here
!
"
<EOS>
say
the
old

him

draw
nearer

"
Jonas
will
be
my
heir

Jonas
will
be
rich

a
great
catch

you

You

<EOS>
"
I

Mr

it
often
enough

"
   
<EOS>
"
He
may
get
more
money
than
with
her

say
the
old

but
she
will
help
him
to
take
care
of
what
they
have

<EOS>
She
be
not
too
young
or
heedless
,

come
of
a
good
hard
gripe
stock

do
not
you
play

fine

game

<EOS>
She
only
hold
him
by
a
thread
;

if
you
draw
it
too
tight
<EOS>
(
I
know
his
temper

<EOS>
it
will
snap
.
 
<EOS>
bind
him
when
he

in
the
mood

Pecksniff

bind
him

<EOS>
You
be
too
deep

<EOS>
in
your
way

him
on

you
will
leave
him
mile
behind

<EOS>
Bah
,
you
man
of
oil

have
I
no
eye
to
see
how
you
have
angle
with
him
from
the
first

"
now
I
wonder
,

think
Mr
Pecksniff

look
at
him
with
a
wistful
face

"
whether
this
be
all
he
have
to
say

<EOS>
Old
Anthony
rub
his
hand
and
mutter
to
himself
;
complain
again
that
he
be
cold
;
draw
his
chair
before
the
fire
;
and
,
sit
with
his
back
to
Mr

,
and
his
chin
sink
down
upon
his

,
be
,
in
another
minute

quite
regardless

forgetful
of
his

<EOS>
uncouth
and
unsatisfactory
as
this
short

have
be

,
it
have
furnish
Mr

with
a
hint

,
suppose
nothing

for

have
never

<EOS>
in

<EOS>
the

about

already

upon
my
word

Mr

that
be
a
very
extraordinary
clock

Pecksniff

<EOS>
It
would
have
be
,
if
it
have
make
the
noise
which
startle
them
;
but
another
kind
of
time
-
piece
be
fast
run
down

from
that
the
sound
proceed

<EOS>
a
scream
from
Chuffey

render
a
hundred
time
more
loud
and
formidable
by
his
silent
habit

make
the
house
ring
from
roof
to
cellar
;
and
,
look
round
,
they
see
Anthony
Chuzzlewit
extend
on
the
floor

with
the
old
clerk
upon
his
knee

<EOS>
He
have
fall
from
his
chair
in
a
fit
,
and
lie
there
,
battle
for
each
gasp
of
breath
,
with
every
shrivel
vein

sinew
start
in
its
place
,
as
if
it

bent
on
bear
witness
to
his
age

sternly
plead
with
Nature
against

<EOS>
It
be
frightful
to
see
how
the
principle

life
,
shut
up
within
his
withered
frame

fight
like
a
strong
devil

mad
to
be
release

rent
its
ancient
prison

house

<EOS>
a
young
man
in
the
fullness
of
his
vigour

struggle
with
so
much
strength
of
desperation

would
have
be
a
dismal
sight
;

an
old

old

shrink
body
,
endow
with
preternatural
might

and
give
the
lie
in
every
motion
of
its
every
limb

joint
to
its
enfeebled
aspect

be
a
hideous
spectacle
indeed

<EOS>
They
raise
him
up
,
and
fetch
a
surgeon
with
all
haste
,
who
bleed
the
patient
and
apply
some
remedy
;

hold
him
so
long

past
midnight

get
him

quiet
now

quite
unconscious

exhausted

into

"

down

motionless

Mr
Pecksniff
have
be
to
the
undertaker
,
and
be
now
upon
his
way
to
another
officer
in
the
train
of
mourning
---
a
female
functionary
,
a
nurse
,
and
watcher
,
and
performer
of
nameless
office
about
the
person
of
the
dead
---
whom
he
have
recommend
.
 
<EOS>
Her
name
,
as
Mr
Pecksniff
gather
from
a
scrap
of
writing
in
his
hand
,
be
Gamp
;
her
residence
in
Kingsgate
Street
,
High
Holborn
.
 
<EOS>
so
Mr
Pecksniff
,
in
a
hackney
cab
,
be
rattle
over
Holborn
stone
,
in
quest
of
Mrs
Gamp
.
   
<EOS>
this
lady
lodge
at
a
bird
-
fancier
's
,
next
door
but
one
to
the
celebrated
mutton
-
pie
shop
,
and
directly
opposite
to
the
original
cat's
-
meat
warehouse
;
the
renown
of
which
establishment
be
duly
herald
on
their
respective
front
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
little
house
,
and
this
be
the
more
convenient
;
for
Mrs
Gamp
be
,
in
her
high
walk
of
art
,
a
monthly
nurse
,
or
,
as
her
sign
-
board
boldly
have
it
,
"
Midwife
,
"
and
lodge
in
the
first
-
floor
front
,
be
easily
assailable
at
night
by
pebble
,
walking
-
stick
,
and
fragment
of
tobacco
-
pipe
;
all
much
more
efficacious
than
the
street
-
door
knocker
,
which
be
so
construct
as
to
wake
the
street
with
ease
,
and
even
spread
alarm
of
fire
in
Holborn
,
without
make
the
small
impression
on
the
premise
to
which
it
be
address
.
   
<EOS>
It
chance
on
this
particular
occasion
,
that
Mrs
Gamp
have
be
up
all
the
previous
night
,
in
attendance
upon
a
ceremony
to
which
the
usage
of
gossip
have
give
that
name
which
express
,
in
two
syllable
,
the
curse
pronounce
on
Adam
.
 
<EOS>
It
chance
that
Mrs
Gamp
have
not
be
regularly
engage
,
but
have
be
call
in
at
a
crisis
,
in
consequence
of
her
great
repute
,
to
assist
another
professional
lady
with
her
advice
;
and
thus
it
happen
that
,
all
point
of
interest
in
the
case
be
over
,
Mrs
Gamp
have
come
home
again
to
the
bird
-
fancier
's
and
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
so
when
Mr
Pecksniff
drive
up
in
the
hackney
cab
,
Mrs
Gamp
's
curtain
be
draw
close
,
and
Mrs
Gamp
be
fast
asleep
behind
them
.
   
<EOS>
if
the
bird
-
fancier
have
be
at
home
,
as
he
ought
to
have
be
,
there
would
have
be
no
great
harm
in
this
;
but
he
be
out
,
and
his
shop
be
close
.
 
<EOS>
the
shutter
be
down
certainly
;
and
in
every
pane
of
glass
there
be
at
least
one
tiny
bird
in
a
tiny
bird
-
cage
,
twitter
and
hop
his
little
ballet
of
despair
,
and
knock
his
head
against
the
roof
;
while
one
unhappy
goldfinch
who
live
outside
a
red
villa
with
his
name
on
the
door
,
draw
the
water
for
his
own
drinking
,
and
mutely
appeal
to
some
good
man
to
drop
a
farthing's
-
worth
of
poison
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
the
door
be
shut
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
try
the
latch
,
and
shake
it
,
cause
a
crack
bell
inside
to
ring
most
mournfully
;
but
no
one
come
.
 
<EOS>
the
bird
-
fancier
be
an
easy
shaver
also
,
and
a
fashionable
hair
-
dresser
also
,
and
perhaps
he
have
be
send
for
,
express
,
from
the
court
end
of
the
town
,
to
trim
a
lord
,
or
cut
and
curl
a
lady
;
but
however
that
may
be
,
there
,
upon
his
own
ground
,
he
be
not
;
nor
be
there
any
more
distinct
trace
of
him
to
assist
the
imagination
of
an
inquirer
,
than
a
professional
print
or
emblem
of
his
calling
(
much
favour
in
the
trade
)
,
represent
a
hair
-
dresser
of
easy
manner
curl
a
lady
of
distinguished
fashion
,
in
the
presence
of
a
patent
upright
grand
pianoforte
.
   
<EOS>
note
these
circumstance
,
Mr
Pecksniff
,
in
the
innocence
of
his
heart
,
apply
himself
to
the
knocker
;
but
at
the
first
double
knock
every
window
in
the
street
become
alive
with
female
head
;
and
before
he
could
repeat
the
performance
whole
troop
of
married
lady
(
some
about
to
trouble
Mrs
Gamp
themselves
very
shortly
)
<EOS>
come
flock
round
the
step
,
all
cry
out
with
one
accord
,
and
with
uncommon
interest
,
"
knock
at
the
winder

sir

<EOS>
Lord
bless
you

no
more
time

"
   
<EOS>
act
upon
this
suggestion
,
and
borrow
the
driver
's
whip
for
the
purpose
,
Mr
Pecksniff
soon
make
a
commotion
among
the
first
floor
flower

pot
,
and
rouse
Mrs
Gamp
,
whose
voice
---
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
the
matron
---
be
hear
to
say
,
"
I
be
come

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
be
as
pale
as
a

"
say
one
lady
,
in
allusion
to
Mr
Pecksniff

<EOS>
"
so
he
ought
to
be

if
he

<EOS>
a
third
lady
(
with

)
say
she
wish
he
have
choose
any
other
time
for
fetch
Mrs
Gamp
,
but
it
always
happen
so
with
HER
.
   
<EOS>
It
give
Mr
Pecksniff
much
uneasiness
to
find
,
from
these
remark
,
that
he
be
suppose
to
have
come
to
Mrs
Gamp
upon
an
errand
touching
---
not
the
close
of
life
,
but
the
other
end
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
herself
be
under
the
same
impression
,
for
,
throw
open
the
window
<EOS>
,
she
cry
behind
the
curtain
,
as
she
hastily
attire
herself
---
    
"
be

"
   
<EOS>
"
no

"
return
Mr

sharply

"
nothing

"
cry
Mrs

<EOS>
"
do
not

<EOS>
"
I
do

you

"
   
<EOS>
as
she
be
by
this
time
in
a
condition
to
appear
,
Mrs
Gamp
,
who
have
a
face
for
all
occasion
,
look
out
of
the
window
with
her
mourning
countenance
,
and
say
she
would
be
down
directly
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
matron
take
it
very
ill
that
Mr
Pecksniff
's
mission
be
of
so
unimportant
a
kind
;
and
the
lady
with
her
arm
fold
rate
him
in
good
round
term
,
signify
that
she
would
be
glad
to
know
what
he
mean
by
terrify
delicate
female
"
with
his
corpse
;

and
give
it
as
her
opinion
that
he
be
quite
ugly
enough
to
know
better

<EOS>
the
other
lady
be
not
at
all
behind

express
similar
sentiment

and
the
child
,
of
whom
some
score
have
now
collect
,
hoot
and
defy
Mr
Pecksniff
quite
savagely
.
 
<EOS>
so
when
Mrs
Gamp
appear
,
the
unoffending
gentleman
be
glad
to
hustle
her
with
very
little
ceremony
into
the
cabriolet

off

popular
execration

<EOS>
Mrs

large
bundle
with
her

a
pair
of
patten

and
a
species
of
gig
umbrella

except
where
a
circular
patch
of
a
lively
blue
have
be
dexterously
let
in
at
the
top

<EOS>
She
be
much
flurry
by
the
haste
she
have
make
,
and
labour
under
the
most
erroneous
view
of
cabriolet
,
which
she
appear
to
confound
with
mail

coach
or
stage
-
wagon

inasmuch
as
she
be
constantly
endeavour
for
the
first
half
mile
to
force
her
luggage
through
the
little
front
window
,

with
which

play
innumerable
game

It

<EOS>
She

a
fat
old
woman

this
Mrs

with
a
husky
voice

a
moist
eye
,
which
she
have
a
remarkable
power
of
turn
up
,
and
only
show
the
white
of
it

<EOS>
have
very
little
neck

it
cost
her
some
trouble
to
look
over
herself
,
if
one
may

so
,
at
those
to
whom
she
talk
.
 
<EOS>
She
wear
a
very
rusty
black
gown
,
rather
the
bad
for

and
a
shawl

bonnet

in

time
out

on

the
present
;
for

at
once
express
a
decent
amount
of
veneration
for
the
deceased
,
and
invite
the
next
of
kin
to
present
her
with
a
fresher
suit
of
weed
;
an
appeal
so
frequently
successful
,
that

ghost
of
Mrs

,
bonnet
and
all
,
may
be
see
hang
up

any

of
Mrs

somewhat
red

like

Mrs

he
look
towards
it
with
a
livid
face
and
start
eye

as

do
the
fire
fiicker
in
a
draught
of
air

over
his

as
almost
dread
to
behold
some
shroud

and
flap
at
it
with
its
fearful
dress

<EOS>
the
light
noise
disturb
him
;
and
once
,
in
the
night
,
at
the
sound
of
a
footstep
overhead
,
he
cry
out
that
the
dead
man
be
walk

tramp
,
tramp
,
tramp

about
his
coffin

<EOS>
He

the
howling
of
a
dog

him
with
a
terror
he

not

<EOS>
He
avoid
the
reflection
in
the
opposite
window
of
the
light
that
burn
above

as
though
it

an
angry

He

rise
up
from

<EOS>
that
excellent
gentleman

him
infinite
service

avail
himself
of
these

such
good
purpose
,
that
they
keep
quite
a
dainty
table
during
this
melancholy
season
;
with
sweetbread
,
stewed
kidney
,
oyster
,
and
other
such
light
viand
for
supper
every
night
;
over
which
,
and
sundry
jorum
of
hot
punch
,
Mr
Pecksniff
deliver
such
moral
reflection
and
spiritual
consolation
as
may
have
convert
a
Heathen
---
especially
if
he
have
have
but
an
imperfect
acquaintance
with
the
english
tongue

<EOS>
nor

Mr

sad
time

<EOS>
Mrs

to
be
very
choice
in
her

scorn

in
her

she

very
punctual
and
particular

require
a
pint
of
mild

Real

the
bottle

such
casual
invitation
to
refresh
herself
with
wine
as
the
good
breeding

may
prompt
them
to
offer

<EOS>
in
like
manner
,
Mr
Mould
's
man
find
it
necessary
to
drown
their
grief
,
like
a
young
kitten
in
the
morning
of
its
existence
,
for
which
reason
they
generally
fuddle
themselves
before
they
begin
to
do
anything

lest
it
should
make
head
and
get
the
well
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
the
whole
of
that
strange
week
be
a
round
of
dismal
joviality
and
grim
enjoyment
;
and
every
one
,
except
poor
Chuffey
,
who

within
the
shadow
of
Anthony

desk
in
the
little
glass
office
with
his
gold
watch
in
his
unoccupied

and
converse
with
Mrs

,
look
as
mournful
as
could
be
reasonably
expect
of

Mr

feather

everything

Come

know
.
 
<EOS>
how
do
you
account
for
that
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
perhaps
it
be
because

Mrs

his
chief
mourner
in
fact
---
an
obese
person
,
with
his
waistcoat
in
close
connection
with
his
leg
than
be
quite
reconcilable
with
the
establish
idea
of
grace
;
with
that
cast
of
feature
which
be
figuratively
call
a
bottle
nose
;
and
with
a
face
cover
all
over
with
pimple

He

from
constant
blowing

,
"
rejoin
Mr

put
up
his

at

in

little
shaving

glass
,
that
he
may
be
sure
his

have
the
right

<EOS>
Mr
Tacker
,
who
from
his
great
experience
in
the
performance
of
funeral
,
would
have
make
an
excellent
pantomime
actor
,
wink
at
Mrs
Gamp
without
at
all
disturb
the
gravity
of
his
countenance
,
and
follow
his
master
into
the
next
room
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
point
with
Mr
Mould
,
and
a
part
of
his
professional
tact
,
not
to
seem
to
know
the
doctor
;
though
in
reality
they
be
near
neighbour
,
and
very
often
,
as
in
the
present
instance
,
work
together

so
he
advance
to
fit
on
his
black
kid
glove

if

never

him

his
life

the
doctor
,
on
his
part
,
look
as
distant
and
unconscious
as
if
he
have
hear
and
read
of
undertaker
,

have
pass
their
shop
,
but
have
never
before
be
bring
into

<EOS>
"
   
"
quite

"
return
Mould
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
the
ground
would
have
be
wet
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
for
my
glass
fall
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
We
may
congratulate
ourselves
upon
our
good
fortune
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
see
by
this
time
that
Mr
Jonas
and
Chuffey
be
go
out
at
the
door
,
he
put
a
white
pocket
-
handkerchief
to
his
face
as
if
a
violent
burst
of
grief
have
suddenly
come
upon
him
,
and
walk
down
side
by
side
with
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Mould
and
his
man
have
not
exaggerate
the
grandeur
of
the
arrangement
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
splendid
.
 
<EOS>
the
four
hearse
-
horse
,
especially
,
rear
and
prance
,
and
show
their
high
action
,
as
if
they
know
a
man
be
dead
,
and
triumph
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
break
us
,
drive
us
,
ride
us
;
ill

treat
,
abuse

and
maim
us
for
their
pleasure
---
but
they
die
;
Hurrah
,
they
die
!
"
   
<EOS>
so
through
the
narrow
street
and
wind
city
way
,
go
Anthony
Chuzzlewit
's
funeral
;
Mr
Jonas
glance
stealthily
out
of
the
coach
-
window
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
to
observe
its
effect
upon
the
crowd
;
Mr
Mould
as
he
walk
along
,
listen
with
a
sober
pride
to
the
exclamation
of
the
bystander
;
the
doctor
whisper
his
story
to
Mr
Pecksniff
,
without
appear
to
come
any
nearer
the
end
of
it
;
and
poor
old
Chuffey
sob
unregarde
in
a
corner
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
greatly
scandalize
Mr
Mould
at
an
early
stage
of
the
ceremony
by
carry
his
handkerchief
in
his
hat
in
a
perfectly
informal
manner
,
and
wipe
his
eye
with
his
knuckle
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
Mr
Mould
himself
have
say
already
,
his
behaviour
be
indecent
,
and
quite
unworthy
of
such
an

"
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
warning
sulkiness
in
the
manner
of
this
speech
,
which
admonish
Mr
Pecksniff
that
his
dear
friend
be
not
to
be
trifle
with
or
fence
off
,
and
that
he
must
either
return
a
straight
-
forward
reply
to
his
question
,
or
plainly
give
him
to
understand
that
he
decline
to
enlighten
him
upon
the
subject
to
which
it
refer
.
 
<EOS>
mindful
in
this
dilemma
of
the
caution
<EOS>
old
Anthony
have
give
him
almost
with
his
late
breath
,
he
resolve
to
speak
to
the
point
,
and
so
tell
Mr
Jonas
(
enlarge
upon
the
communication
as
a
proof
of
his
great
attachment
and
confidence
)
,
that
in
the
case
he
have
put
;
to
wit
,
in
the
event
of
such
a
man
as
he
propose
for
his
daughter
's
hand
,
he
would
endow
her
with
a
fortune
of
four
thousand
pound
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
sadly
pinch
and
cramp
myself
to
do
so
,
"
be
his
fatherly
remark
;
"
but
that
would
be
my
duty
,
and
my
conscience
would
reward
me
.
 
<EOS>
for
myself
,
my
conscience
be
my
bank
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
trifle
invest
there
---
a
mere
trifle
,
Mr
Jonas
---
<EOS>
but
I
prize
it
as
a
store
of
value
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
good
man
's
enemy
would
have
divide
upon
this
question
into
two
party
.
 
<EOS>
one
would
have
assert
without
scruple
that
if
Mr
Pecksniff
's
conscience
be
his
bank
,
and
he
keep
a
running
account
there
,
he
must
have
overdraw
it
beyond
all
mortal
mean
of
computation
.
 
<EOS>
the
other
would
have
contend
that
it
be
a
mere
fictitious
form
;
a
perfectly
blank
book
;
or
one
in
which
entry
be
only
make
with
a
peculiar
kind
of
invisible
ink
to
become
legible
at
some
indefinite
time
;
and
that
he
never
trouble
it
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
sadly
pinch
and
cramp
me
,
my
dear
friend
,
"
repeat
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
but
Providence
---
<EOS>
perhaps
I
may
be
permit
to
say
a
special
Providence
---
have
bless
my
endeavour
,
and
I
could
guarantee
to
make
the

"
   
<EOS>
a
question
of
philosophy
arise
here
,
whether
Mr
Pecksniff
have
or
have
not
good
reason
to
say
that
he
be
specially
patronize
and
encourage
in
his
undertaking
.
 
<EOS>
all
his
life
long
he
have
be
walk
up
and
down
the
narrow
way
and
by
-
place
,
with
a
hook
in
one
hand
and
a
crook
in
the
other
,
scrape
all
sort
of
valuable
odd
and
end
into
his
pouch
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
there
be
a
special
Providence
in
the
fall
of
a
sparrow
<EOS>
,
it
follow
(
so
Mr
Pecksniff
,
and
only
such
admirable
man
,
would
have
reason
)
,
that
there
must
also
be
a
special
Providence
in
the
alighting
of
the
stone
or
stick
,
or
other
substance
which
be
aim
at
the
sparrow
.
 
<EOS>
and
Mr
Pecksniff
's
hook
,
or
crook
,
have
invariably
knock
the
sparrow
on
the
head
and
bring
him
down
,
that
gentleman
may
have
be
lead
to
consider
himself
as
specially
licensed
to
bag
sparrow
,
and
as
be
specially
seize
and
possess
of
all
the
bird
he
have
get
together
.
 
<EOS>
that
many
undertaking
,
national
as
well
as
individual
---
but
especially
the
former
---
be
hold
to
be
specially
bring
to
a
glorious
and
successful
issue
,
which
never
could
be
so
regard
on
any
other
process
of
reasoning
,
<EOS>
must
be
clear
to
all
man
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
the
precedent
would
seem
to
show
that
Mr
Pecksniff
have
(
as
thing
go
)
good
argument
for
what
he
say
and
may
be
permit
to
say
it
,
and
do
not
say
it
presumptuously
,
vainly
,
or
arrogantly
,
but
in
a
spirit
of
high
faith
and
great
wisdom
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
,
not
be
much
accustom
to
perplex
his
mind
with
theory
of
this
nature
,
express
no
opinion
on
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
nor
do
he
receive
his
companion
's
announcement
with
one
solitary
syllable
,
good
,
bad
,
or
indifferent
.
 
<EOS>
He
preserve
this
taciturnity
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
least
,
and
during
the
whole
of
that
time
appear
to
be
steadily
engage
in
subject
some
give
amount
to
the
operation
of
every
know
rule
in
figure
;
add
to
it
,
take
from
it
,
multiply
it
,
reduce
it
by
long
and
short
division
;
work
it
by
the
rule
-
of
-
three
direct
and
inversed
;
exchange
or
barter
;
practice
;
simple
interest
;
compound
interest
;
and
other
mean
of
arithmetical
calculation
.
 
<EOS>
the
result
of
these
labour
appear
to
be
satisfactory
,
for
when
he
do
break
silence
,
it
be
as
one
who
have
arrive
at
some
specific
result
,
and
free
himself
from
a
state
of
distress
uncertainty
.
   
<EOS>
"
come
,
old
Pecksniff
!
"
<EOS>
---
such
be
his
jocose
address
,
as
he
slap
that
gentleman
on
the
back
,
at
the
end
of
the
stage
---
"
let
's
have
something
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
with
all
my
heart
,
"
say
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
let
's
treat
the
driver
,
"
cry
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
you
think
it
will
not
hurt
the
man
,
or
render
him
discontent
with
his
station
---
certainly
,
"
falter
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
Jonas
only
laugh
at
this
,
and
get
down
from
the
coach
-
top
with
great
alacrity
,
cut
a
cumbersome
kind
of
caper
in
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
after
which
,
he
go
into
the
public
-
house
,
and
there
order
spirituous
drink
to
such
an
extent
,
that
Mr
Pecksniff
have
some
doubt
of
his
perfect
sanity
,
until
Jonas
set
them
quite
at
rest
by
say
,
when
the
coach
could
wait
no
longer
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
stand
treat
for
a
whole
week
and
more
,
and
let
you
have
all
the
delicacy
of
the
season
.
 
<EOS>
you
shall
pay
for
this
Pecksniff
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
joke
either
,
as
Mr
Pecksniff
at
first
suppose
;
for
he
go
off
to
the
coach
without
further
ceremony
,
and
leave
his
respected
victim
to
settle
the
bill
.
   
<EOS>
but
Mr
Pecksniff
be
a
man
of
meek
endurance
,
and
Mr
Jonas
be
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
moreover
,
his
regard
for
that
gentleman
be
found
,
as
we
know
,
on
pure
esteem
,
and
a
knowledge
of
the
excellence
of
his
character
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
out
from
the
tavern
with
a
smile
face
,
and
even
go
so
far
as
to
repeat
the
performance
,
on
a
less
expensive
scale
,
at
the
next
ale
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
certain
wildness
in
the
spirit
of
Mr
Jonas
(
not
usually
a
part
of
his
character
)
which
be
far
from
be
subdue
by
these
mean
,
and
,
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
,
he
be
so
very
buoyant
---
it
may
be
say
,
boisterous
---
that
Mr
Pecksniff
have
some
difficulty
in
keep
pace
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
They
be
not
expect
---
<EOS>
oh
dear
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
have
propose
in
London
to
give
the
girl
a
surprise
,
and
have
say
he
would
not
write
a
word
to
prepare
them
on
any
account
,
in
order
that
he
and
Mr
Jonas
may
take
them
unawares
,
and
just
see
what
they
be
do
,
when
they
think
their
dear
papa
be
mile
and
mile
away
.
 
<EOS>
as
a
consequence
of
this
playful
device
,
there
be
nobody
to
meet
them
at
the
finger
-
post
,
but
that
be
of
small
consequence
,
for
they
have
come
down
by
the
day
coach
,
and
Mr
Pecksniff
have
only
a
carpetbag
,
while
Mr
Jonas
have
only
a
portmanteau
.
 
<EOS>
They
take
the
portmanteau
between
them
,
put
the
bag
upon
it
,
and
walk
off
up
the
lane
without
delay
;
Mr
Pecksniff
already
go
on
tiptoe
as
if
,
without
this
precaution
,
his
fond
child
,
be
then
at
a
distance
of
a
couple
of
mile
or
so
,
would
have
some
filial
sense
of
his
approach
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
lovely
evening
in
the
spring
-
time
of
the
year
;
and
in
the
soft
stillness
of
the
twilight
,
all
nature
be
very
calm
and
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
have
be
fine
and
warm
;
but
at
the
come
on
of
night
,
the
air
grow
cool
,
and
in
the
mellowing
distance
smoke
be
rise
gently
from
the
cottage
chimney
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
thousand
pleasant
scent
diffuse
around
,
from
young
leave
and
fresh
bud
;
the
cuckoo
have
be
singe
all
day
long
,
and
be
but
just
now
hush
;
the
smell
of
earth
newly

upturned
,
first
breath
of
hope
to
the
first
labourer
after
his
garden
wither
,
be
fragrant
in
the
evening
breeze
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
time
when
most
man
cherish
good
resolve
,
and
sorrow
for
the
waste
past
;
when
most
man
,
look
on
the
shadow
as
they
gather
,
think
of
that
evening
which
must
close
on
all
,
and
that
to

morrow
which
have
none
beyond

<EOS>
"
precious
dull

"
say
Mr
Jonas
,
look
about

<EOS>
"
It
be
enough
to
make
a
man
go
melancholy
mad

<EOS>
"
We

soon

"
to

you
the

Mr

say
Pecksniff
with
great
solemnity
,
"
my
mind
be
run
at
that
moment
on
our
late

your

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
immediately
let
his
burden
fall
,
and
say
,
threaten
him
with
his
hand
:
   
<EOS>
"
drop
that
,
Pecksniff

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
not
exactly
know
whether
allusion
be
make
to
the
subject
or
the
portmanteau
,
stare
at
his
friend
in
unaffected
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
drop
it
,
I
say
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Jonas
,
fiercely
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
hear
?
 
<EOS>
drop
it
,
now
and
for
ever

<EOS>
You

well

I
give
you
notice
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
quite
a
mistake
,
"
urge
Mr
Pecksniff
,
very
much
dismayed
;
"
though
I
admit
it
be
foolish
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
know
it
be

"
   
"
do
not

to
me
about
tender

Jonas
,
wipe
his

with
the
cuff
of
his
coat
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
go
to

over

because
I

<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
have
get
out
the
word
"
crow
over
,
Mr
Jonas
!
"
<EOS>
when
that
young
man
,
with
a
dark
expression
in
his
countenance
,
cut
him
short
once
more
:
   
"
mind
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not

it

<EOS>
I
advise
you
not

the

neither
to

anybody
else

<EOS>
You
can
take
a
hint

if
you
choose
as
well
as
another

<EOS>
there
be
enough
say
about
it

<EOS>
come
along
!
"
   
<EOS>
take
up
his
part
of
the
load
again
,
when
he
have
say
these
word
,
he
hurry
on
so
fast
that
Mr
Pecksniff
,
at
the
other
end
of
the
portmanteau
,
find
himself
drag
forward
,
in
a
very
inconvenient
and
ungraceful
manner

to
the
great
detriment
of
what
be
call
by
fancy
gentleman
"
the
bark

upon
his
shin

which
be
most
unmercifully
bump
against
the
hard
leather

the
iron

<EOS>
in
the
course
of
a
few
minute
,
however
,
Mr

relax
his
speed
,
and
suffer
his
companion
to
come
up
with
him
,
and
to
bring
the
portmanteau
into
a
tolerably
straight
position
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
pretty
clear
that
he
regret
his
late
outbreak

and
that
he
mistrust
its
effect
on
Mr

for
as
often
as
that
gentleman
glance
towards
Mr

,
he
find
Mr

glance
at
him
,
which
be
a
new
source
of
embarrassment

<EOS>
It
be
but
a
short
-
live
one
,
though
,
for
Mr

soon
begin
to
whistle

whereupon
Mr

take
his

from

melodiously

upstairs

he
so
far
comply
with
the
young

adjuration

<EOS>
but
though
he

the
fair
Cherry

he
could
not
help
look
back
at
her
sister

and
exchange
some
further
dialogue
of
the

bantering
description
,
as
they

His

under

<EOS>
the
grin
with
which
he
accompany
this

set
off
his
other
attraction
to
such
unspeakable
advantage
,
that
even
Mr
Pecksniff
lose
his
presence
of

for
a
moment

look
at
the
young

stupefy

be
in

They
seem
to
be
stranger

as
well

I
could
make
out
in

dusk

I
think
I
do

presently
I
leave
off

walk
up

loft

take
a

no

favour
almost
as
soon

they

reconcile

through

mere
fact

have
Jonas
in

the
impossibility

up

or
tie
him
hand

put
him
in

hysteric

utmost
disorder

Jonas
in

Martin
Chuzzlewit

doorstep

the
total
hopelessness
of
be
able
to
disguise
or
feasibly
explain
this
state
of
rampant
confusion

the
sudden
accumulation
over
his

his
extrication
from

he
have
trust

good

fill
the

dismay

that
if
Tom
could
have
be
a
Gorgon
stare
at
Mr

,
and
Mr

could
have
be
a
Gorgon
stare
at

the
noise

<EOS>
It
may
be
well
to
begin
the

admission

imagine

any
connection

high
companion

again

independence

again
it
contemplate
with
pious
awe
that
moral
sense

again
inhale
that
sacred

be
the

oh
noble
patriot

and
now
the

yell

as
it
be
lash

torture
like

infinitely
great

if

urge

it
have
within
it
the
element

dangerous

no
such

may
be
tamper

at

pleasure

<EOS>
look
at
that
engine

<EOS>
It
shall
cost
a

more
dollar
in
the
way
of

fine

and
satisfaction
of
the
outraged

to
deface
in
wantonness
that
senseless

Martin
look
round

and
find
that
a
gentleman
,
on
the
seat
behind

have
thrust
his
head
between
himself
and
Mark
,
and
sit
with
his
chin
rest
on
the
back
rail
of
their
little
bench
,
entertain
himself
with
their
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
as
languid
and
listless
in
his
look
as
most
of
the
gentleman
they
have
see
;
his
cheek
be
so
hollow
that
he
seem
to
be
always
suck
them
in
;
and
the
sun
have
burn
him
,
not
a
wholesome
red
or
brown
,
but
dirty
yellow
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
bright
dark
eye
,
which
he
keep
half
closed
;
<EOS>
only
peep
out
of
the
corner
,
and
even
then
with
a
glance
that
seem
to
say
,
"
now
you
will
not
overreach
me
;
you
want
to
,
but
you
will
not

"
 
<EOS>
His
arm
rest
carelessly
on
his
knee
as
he
lean
forward
;
in
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
,
as
english
rustic
have
their
slice
of
cheese
,
he
have
a
cake
of
tobacco
;
in
his
right
a
penknife
.
 
<EOS>
He
strike
into
the
dialogue
with
as
little
reserve
as
if
he
have
be
specially
call
in
,
day
before
,
to
hear
the
argument
on
both
side
,

favour
them
with
his
opinion

he
no

contemplated

care
for
the
possibility
of
their
not
desire
the
honour
of
his
acquaintance
or
interference
in
their
private
affair
than

<EOS>
"

condescendingly

Darn
all
manner

"
   
<EOS>
Martin
could
not
help
frown
for
a
moment
,
as
if
he
be
dispose
to
insinuate
that
the
gentleman
have
unconsciously
"
darn
"
himself
.
<EOS>
but
remember
the
wisdom
of
do
at
Rome
as
Romans
do
,
he
smile
with
the
pleasantest
expression
he
could
assume
upon
so
short
a
notice
.
   
<EOS>
Their
new
friend
say
no
more
just
then
,
be
busily
employ
in
cut
a
quid
or
plug
from
his
cake
of
tobacco
,
and
whistle
softly
to
himself
the
while
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
shape
it
to
his
liking
,
he
take
out
his
old
plug
,
and
deposit
the
same
on
the
back
of
the
seat
between
Mark
and
Martin
,
while
he
thrust
the
new
one
into
the
hollow
of
his
cheek
,
where
it
look
like
a
large
walnut
,
or
tolerable
pippin
.
 
<EOS>
find
it
quite
satisfactory
,
he
stick
the
point
of
his
knife
into
the
old
plug
,
and
hold
it
out
for
their
inspection
,
remark
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
have
not
live
in
vain
,
that
it
be
"
use
up
considerable
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
he
toss
it
away
;
put
his
knife
into
one
pocket
and
his
tobacco
into
another
;
rest
his
chin
upon
the
rail
as
before
;
and
approve
of
the
pattern
on
Martin
's
waistcoat
,
reach
out
his
hand
to
feel
the
texture
of
that
garment
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
call
this
now

he
ask

Martin
not

be
a
pause

<EOS>
Mr

this
inquiry

impertinent

great
stress

the

his

often

in

Thank'ee

if
any

thereabout

otherwise

want
such
a

I
could
take
that
part

sir

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
against
any
architect
in
the
States
,
"
say
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
get
a
couple
of
sherry
-
cobbler
,
Mark
,
and
we
will
drink
success
to
the
firm

"
   
<EOS>
either
he
forget
already
(
and
often
afterwards
)
,
that
they
be
no
longer
master
and
servant
,
or
consider
this
kind
of
duty
to
be
among
the
legitimate
function
of
the
Co.
 
<EOS>
but
Mark
obey
with
his
usual
alacrity
;
and
before
they
part
for
the
night
,
it
be
agree
between
them
that
they
should
go
together
to
the
agent
be
in
the
morning
,
but
that
Martin
should
decide
the
Eden
question
,
on
his
own
sound
judgment
.
 
<EOS>
and
Mark
make
no
merit
,
even
to
himself
in
his
jollity
,
of
this
concession
;
perfectly
well
know
that
the
matter
would
come
to
that
in
the
end
,
any
way
.
   
<EOS>
the
General
be
one
of
the
party
at
the
public
table
next
day
,
and
after
breakfast
suggest
that
they
should
wait
upon
the
agent
without
loss
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
They
,
desire
nothing
more
,
agree
;
so
off
they
all
four
start
for
the
office
of
the
Eden
Settlement
,
which
be
almost
within
rifle
-
shot
of
the
National
Hotel
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
small
place
---
something
like
a
turnpike
.
 
<EOS>
but
a
great
deal
of
land
may
be
get
into
a
dice
-
box
,
and
why
may
not
a
whole
territory
be
bargain
for
in
a
shed
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
but
<EOS>
a
temporary
office
too
;
for
the
Edeners
be
"
go
"
to
build
a
superb
establishment
for
the
transaction
of
their
business
,
and
have
already
get
so
far
as
to
mark
out
the
site
.
 
<EOS>
which
be
a
great
way
in
America
.
 
<EOS>
the
office
-
door
be
wide
open
,
and
in
the
doorway
be
the
agent
;
no
doubt
a
tremendous
fellow
to
get
through
his
work
,
for
he
seem
to
have
no
arrear
,
but
be
swinge
backwards
and
forwards
in
a
rocking
-
chair
,
with
one
of
his
leg
plant
high
up
against
the
door
-
post
,
and
the
other
double
up
under
him
,
as
if
he
be
hatch
his
foot
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
a
gaunt
man
in
a
huge
straw
hat
,
and
a
coat
of
green
stuff
.
<EOS>
the
weather
be
hot
,
he
have
no
cravat
,
and
wear
his
shirt
collar
wide
open
;
so
that
every
time
he
speak
something
be
see
to
twitch
and
jerk
up
in
his
throat
,
like
the
little
hammer
in
a
harpsichord
when
the
note
be
strike
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
the
Truth
feebly
endeavour
to
leap
to
his
lip
.
 
<EOS>
if
so
,
it
never
reach
them
.
   
<EOS>
two
grey
eye
lurk
deep
within
this
agent
's
head
,
but
one
of
them
have
no
sight
in
it
,
and
stand
stock
still
.
 
<EOS>
with
that
side
of
his
face
he
seem
to
listen
to
what
the
other
side
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
thus
each
profile
have
a
distinct
expression
;
and
when
the
movable
side
be
most
in
action
,
the
rigid
one
be
in
its
cold
state
of
watchfulness
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
like
turn
the
man
inside
out
,
to
pass
to
that
view
of
his
feature
in
his
lively
mood
,
and
see
how
calculate
and
intent
they
be
.
   
<EOS>
each
long
black
hair
upon
his
head
hang
down
as
straight
as
any
plummet
line
;
but
rumpled
tuft
be
on
the
arch
of
his
eye
,
as
if
the
crow
whose
foot
be
deeply
print
in
the
corner
have
peck
and
tear
them
in
a
savage
recognition
of
his
kindre
nature
as
a
bird
of
prey
.
   
<EOS>
such
be
the
man
whom
they
now
approach
,
and
whom
the
General
salute
by
the
name
of
Scadder
.
   
<EOS>
"

He

then

now

"
   
"
if
I
can
realise
your
meaning
,
ride
me
on
a
rail

"
return
the
General
,
after
pause
for
consideration
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
we
do
not
wish
to
sell
the
lot
off
right
away
to
any

Scadder

be
enough
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
do
not

"
   
<EOS>
the
General
whisper
Martin
that
Scadder
be
the
honest
fellow
in
the
world
,
and
that
he
would
not
have
give
him
offence
designedly
,
for
ten
thousand
dollar
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
my

say
Scadder
in
a
low
voice

look
down
the
road

rock
still

They

<EOS>
Mr
Scadder
be
so
satisfied
by
this
explanation
,
that
he
shake
the
General
warmly
by
the
hand
,
and
get
out
of
the
rocking

chair
to

He
then
invite

that

"
I

feign

show
by
his
tremulous
voice
how
much
depend

in

upon

thrust
his

his

acre

<EOS>
He
grumblingly
open
his
book
notwithstanding

and
always
keep
his
bright
side
towards
Mark
,
no
matter
at
what
amount
of
inconvenience
to
himself
,
display
a
certain
leaf
for
their
perusal

<EOS>
Martin
read
it
greedily
,
and
then
inquire
:
   
"
now
where
upon
the
plan

this
place

"
upon

"
<EOS>
yes

He
turn
towards
it

be
put
upon

resolve
to
be

the
very
minute
hair

<EOS>
at
length
,
after
wheel
his
toothpick
slowly
round
and
round
in
the
air
,
as
if
it
be
a
carrier
pigeon
just
throw
up
,
he
suddenly
make
a
dart
at
the
drawing
,
and
pierce
the
very
centre
of
the
main

through

through

<EOS>
"
there

he

<EOS>
Martin
glance
with
sparkling
eye
upon
his
Co.

his

see
that
the
thing
be

<EOS>
the
bargain

not

as
easily
as

have
be
expect
though
,
for
scadder
be
caustic
and
ill

humoured
,
and
cast
much
unnecessary
opposition
in
the
way
;
at
one
time
request
them
to
think
of
it
,
and
call
again
in
a
week
or
a
fortnight
;
at
another
,
predict
that
they
would
not
like
it
;
at
another
,
offer
to
retract
and
let
them
off
,
and
mutter
strong
imprecation
upon
the
folly
of
the
General
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
whole
of
the
astoundingly
small
sum
total
of
purchase

money
<EOS>
---
it
be
only
one
hundred

fifty
dollar
,
or
something
more
than
thirty
pound
of

by

into
the
architectural

be
ultimately
pay
down
;
and
Martin
's
head
be
<EOS>
two
inch
nearer
the
roof
of
the
little
wooden
office
,
with
the
consciousness
of

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
Mark
look
back
several
time
as
they

down
the

now
his
blighted
profile
be
towards
them
,
and
nothing

attentive
thoughtfulness
be
write
on

<EOS>
strangely
different

<EOS>
He
be
not
a

to
laughing

never
laugh
outright

every

vein
in

up

<EOS>
the
compound

of
death

the
top
of
the
old
ballad
be
not

with
a
great
nicety

not
half
more
monstrously
unlike

rate

the

,

know
what
it
be
all
about
,
Martin
keep
close
to
the
General
;
and
,
keep
closer
than
ever
when
they
enter
the
Hall
,
get
by
that
mean
upon
a
little
platform
of
table
at
the
upper
end

where
an
armchair

"

with
anguish
,
I
expect
!
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
certainly
think
it
possible
that
the
British
Lion
may
have
be
rather
out
of
his
element
in
that
Ark
;
but
he
keep
the
idea
to
himself

<EOS>
the

be
then
vote
to
the

on
the
motion
of
a
pallid
lad
of
the
Jefferson

forthwith
set
in
for
a
high

spice
speech
,
with
a
good
deal
about
hearth

home
in
it

and
unrivete
the

Tyranny

<EOS>
oh

it

be

"
   
<EOS>
when
it
be
find
that

do
not
come
,
but
keep
out
of
the
way
;
that
the
young
Columbian
stand
there
,
with
fold
arm
,
alone
in
his
glory
;
and
consequently
that

Eagles
be
no

laugh
wildly
on

;
such
cheer
arise
as
may
have
shake
the
hand
upon
the
Horse

clock
,
and
change
the
very
mean
time
of
the

in

capital
.
   
<EOS>
"
who
be
this
?
"
<EOS>
Martin
telegraph
to
La

.
   
<EOS>
the
Secretary
write
something
,
very
gravely
,
on
a
piece
of
paper
,
twist
it
up
,
and
have
it
pass
to
him
from
hand
to
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
improvement
on
the
old
sentiment
:
"
perhaps
as
remarkable
a
man
as
any
in
our
country
.
"
   
<EOS>
this
young
Columbian
be
succeed
by
another
,
to
the
full
as
eloquent
as
he
,
who
draw
down
storm
of
cheer
.
 
<EOS>
but
both
remarkable
youth
,
in
their
great
excitement
(
for
your
true
poetry
can
never
stoop
to
detail
)
<EOS>
,
forget
to
say
with
whom
or
what
the
Watertoasters
sympathize
,
and
likewise
why
or
wherefore
they
be
sympathetic
.
<EOS>
thus
Martin
remain
for
a
long
time
as
completely
in
the
dark
as
ever
;
until
at
length
a
ray
of
light
break
in
upon
him
through
the
medium
of
the
Secretary
,
who
,
by
read
the
minute
of
their
past
proceeding
,
make
the
matter
somewhat
clear
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
learn
that
the
Watertoast
Association
sympathize
with
a
certain
public
Man
in
Ireland
,
who
hold
a
contest
upon
certain
point
with
England
;
and
that
they
do
so
,
because
they
do
not
love
England
at
all
---
not
by
any
mean
because
they
love
Ireland
much
;
be
indeed
horribly
jealous
and
distrustful
of
its
people
always
,
and
only
tolerate
them
because
of
their
work
hard
,
which
make
them
very
useful
;
labour
be
hold
in
great
indignity
in
the
simple
republic
than
in
any
other
country
upon
earth
.
 
<EOS>
this
render
Martin
curious
to
see
what
ground
of
sympathy
<EOS>
the
Watertoast
Association
put
forth
;
nor
be
he
long
in
suspense
,
for
the
General
rise
to
read
a
letter
to
the
Public
Man
,
which
with
his
own
hand
he
have
write
.
   
<EOS>

he
have
open

<EOS>
now

its

very

the

down

he
hurry
to

place
in

a

in

for

a
long
interval

woman

Mrs

who

have
by

run

<EOS>
Martin
by
degree
become
so
far
awake

that
he
have
a
sense

a
terrible
oppression
on
his
mind
;
an
imperfect
dream
that
he
have
murder
a
particular
friend
,
and
could
not
get
rid
of
the
body
.
<EOS>
when
his
eye
open
it
be
stare
him
full
in
the
face

<EOS>
there
be
the
horrible
Hominy
talk
deep
truth
in
a
melodious
snuffle
,
and
pour
forth
her
mental
endowment
to
such
an
extent
that
the
Major
's
bitter
enemy
,
hear
her
,
would
have
forgive
him
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
may
have
do
something
desperate
if
the
gong
have
not
sound
for
supper

but
sound
<EOS>
it
do
most
opportunely
;
and
have
station
Mrs
Hominy
at
the
upper
end
of
the
table
he
take
refuge
at
the
low
end
himself
;
whence
,
after
a
hasty
meal
he
steal
away
,
while
the
lady
be
yet
busy
with
dry
beef

a
saucer

full
of
pickle

It
would
be
difficult

give

adequate

freshness
next
day

or
of
the
avidity
with
which
she
go
headlong
into
moral
philosophy
at
breakfast

<EOS>
some
little
additional
degree
of
asperity
,
perhaps
,
be
visible
in
her
feature
,
but
not
more
than
the
pickle
would
have
naturally
produce

<EOS>
all
that
day
she
cling
to
Martin

She
sit
beside
him

his

there
be
another
Reception

yet
more
numerous

the
former

,
propounded
theory

and
answer
imaginary
objection

so
that
Martin
really
begin
to
think
he
must
be
dream

speak
for
two
;
she
quote
interminable
passage
from
certain
essay
on
government
,
write
by
herself
;
use
the
Major

pocket

handkerchief
as
if
the
snuffle
be
a
temporary
malady
,
of
which
she
be
determined
to
rid
herself
by
some
mean
or
other
;
and
,
in
short
,
be
such
a
remarkable
companion
,
that
Martin
quite
settle
it
between
himself
and
his
conscience
,
that
in
any
new
settlement
it
would
be
absolutely
necessary
to
have
such
a
person
knock
on
the
head
for
the
general
peace

<EOS>
in

such

tool

other

<EOS>
the
purchase
of
these
thing

and
the
settlement
of
their
bill
at
the

reduce
their

so
low
an
ebb

if
the

delay
his
departure
any

they
would
have

<EOS>
Farmers

who

a

cast
out
of

with

newly

child

Noon

at

dispirited

weary
to

at

Mark

shout
out
his

<EOS>
Martin

possession

<EOS>
the
joyful
occasion
involve
some
further
account
of
Eden
 
there
happen
to
be
on

the

<EOS>
several
gentleman
passenger

of
the
same
stamp
as
Martin

New

friend
Mr
Bevan

and
in
their
society
he
be
cheerful
and
happy
.
 
<EOS>
They
release
him
as
well
as
they
could
from
the
intellectual
entanglement
of
Mrs
Hominy
;
and
exhibit
,
in
all
they
say
and
do
,
so
much
good
sense
and
high
feeling
,
that
he
could
not

them
too
well

"
if
this
be
a
republic
of
Intellect

instead

as
if

infinitely
above
their

"
   
<EOS>

the
good
on
it

that
when

stroke

such

with
no

make
every

they

sing
out
so
surprising
loud
.

take
notice

if
ever
the

not

in
a
commercial
point

you
see

and
be
inconvenient
in
its
consequence
<EOS>

they
will
take
such
a
shine
out
of
it
,
and
make
such
bragging
speech
,
that
a
man
may
suppose
no

You

p'rhap
by
the
time
I

I
shall
have
grow
into
a
prophet

"
   
<EOS>
He
give
no
utterance
to
these
sentiment
;
but
the
excessive
joviality
they
inspire
within
him
,
and
the
merriment
they
bring
upon
his
shine
face
,
be
quite
enough
for
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
although
he
may
sometimes
profess
to
make
light
of
his
partner
's
inexhaustible
cheerfulness
,
and
may
sometimes
,
as
in
the
case
of
Zephaniah
Scadder
,
find
him
too
jocose
a
commentator
,
he
be
always
sensible
of
the
effect
of
his
example
in
rouse
him
to
hopefulness
and
courage
.
 
<EOS>
whether
he
be
in
the
humour
to
profit
by
it
,
matter
not
a

.
 
<EOS>
It
be
contagious
,
and
he
could
not
choose
but
be
affect
.
   
<EOS>
at
first
they
part
with
some
of
their
passenger
once
or
twice
a
day
,
and
take
in
other
to
replace
them
.
 
<EOS>
but
by
degree
,
the
town
upon
their
route
become
more
thinly
scatter
;
and
for
many
hour
together
they
would
see
no
other
habitation
than
the
hut
of
the
wood
-
cutter
,
where
the
vessel
stop
for
fuel
.
 
<EOS>
Sky
,
wood
,
and
water
all
the
livelong
day

and
heat
that
blister
everything
it
touch

<EOS>
on
they
toil
through
great
solitude
,
where
the
tree
upon
the
bank
grow
thick
and
close
;
and
floatad
in
the
stream
;
and
hold
up
shrivel
arm
from
out
the
river

depth

and
slide
down
from
the
margin
of
the
land
,
half
grow

half
decaying
,
in
the
miry
water
.
<EOS>
on
through
the
weary
day
and
melancholy
night
;
beneath
the
burn
sun
,
and
in
the
mist
and
vapour
of
the
evening
;
on
,
until
return
appear
impossible
,
and
restoration
to
their
home
a
miserable
dream
.
   
<EOS>
They
have
now
<EOS>
but
few
people
on
board
,
and
these
few
be
as
flat
,
as
dull
,
and
stagnant
,
as
the
vegetation
that
oppress
their
eye
.
 
<EOS>
no
sound
of
cheerfulness
or
hope
be
hear
;
no
pleasant
talk
beguile
the
tardy
time
;
no
little
group
make
common
cause
against
the
full
depression
of
the
scene
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
,
at
certain
period
,
they
swallow
food
together
from
a
common
trough
<EOS>
,
it
may
have
be
old
Charon
's
boat
,
convey
melancholy
shade
to
judgment
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
they
draw
near
New
Thermopylae
;
where
,
that
same
evening
,
Mrs
Hominy
would
disembark
.
 
<EOS>
a
gleam
of
comfort
sink
into
Martin
's
bosom
when
she
tell
him
this
.
 
<EOS>
Mark
need
none
;
but
he
be
not
displeased
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
almost
night
when
they
come
alongside
the
landing
-
place
.
 
<EOS>
a
steep
bank
with
an
hotel
like
a
barn
on
the
top
of
it
;
a
wooden
store
or
two
;
and
a
few
scatter
shed
.
   
<EOS>
"
You

here
to

the
morning

"

Mrs

<EOS>
Martin
look
for
it
all
round
the
darkening
panorama
;
but
he
could
not
see
it
,
and
be
oblige
to
say
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
that

it

Mrs

Mrs

nod
her
head
with
great
expression

<EOS>
the
married
Miss

who
have
come
on

give
to
this
statement
her
most
unqualified
support

<EOS>
Martin
gratefully
decline
their
invitation
to
regale
himself
at
their
house
during
the
half
hour
of
the
vessel

stay
;
and
have
escort
Mrs
Hominy
and
the
red
pocket
-
handkerchief
(
which
be
still
on
active
service

safely
across
the
gangway
,
return
in
a
thoughtful
mood
to
watch
the
emigrant
as
they
remove
their
good
ashore
.
   
<EOS>
Mark
,
as
he
stand
beside
him
,
glance
in
his
face
from
time
to
time
;
anxious
to
discover
what
effect
this
dialogue
have
have
upon
him
,
and
not
unwilling
that
his
hope
should
be
dash
before
they
reach
their
destination
,
so
that
the
blow
he
fear
may
be
break
in
its
fall
.
 
<EOS>
but
save
that
he
sometimes
look
up
quickly
at
the
poor
erection
on
the
hill
,
he
give
him
no
clue
to
what
be
pass
in
his
mind
,
until
they
be
again
upon
their
way

<EOS>
"

Most
of

you
know

have
stop
short

the
few
that
be
leave

go
further
on

what

More

<EOS>
"
oh

pause

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes

"
observe
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
how
odd
it
be
that

have
arrange
to
try
their
fortune
at

wretched
hole
like

for
instance

<EOS>
He
speak
in
a
tone
so
very
different
from
his
usual
confidence

with
such
an
obvious
dread
of
Mark
's
reply
,
that
the
good

natured
fellow
be
full
of
pity

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
why

you

"

Mark
,
as
gently
as
he
could
by
any
mean
insinuate
the
observation
,
"
we
must
guard
against
be
too
sanguine

<EOS>
there
be
no
occasion

either

angrily
,
"

there

<EOS>
after
that
,
he
turn
away
,
and
walk
to
and
fro
upon
the
deck
full
two
hour
.

nor
do
he
speak
again
,
except
to
say
"
good

"
until
next
day
;
nor
even
then
upon
this
subject

on
other
topic
quite
foreign
to
the
purpose

<EOS>
as
they
proceed
further
on
their
track
,
and
come
more
and
more
towards
their
journey
's
end

the
monotonous
desolation
of
the
scene
increase
to
that
degree

that
for
any

on

Giant
Despair

It

deadly

<EOS>
Mark
show
no
more
uneasiness
than
if
it
have
be
commend
to
him
as
ambrosia
;
but
he
give
the
man
his
arm
,
and
as
they
go
along
explain
to
him
the
nature
of
their
purchase
,
and
inquire
where
it
lie
.
 
<EOS>
close
to
his
own
log
-
house
,
he
say
;
so
close
that
he
have
use
their
dwelling
as
a
store
-
house
for
some
corn
;
they
must
excuse
it
that
night
,
but
he
would
endeavour
to
get
it
take
out
upon
the
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
give
them
to
understand
,
as
an
additional
scrap
of
local
chit
-
chat
,
that
he
have
bury
the
last
proprietor
with
his
own
hand
;
a
piece
of
information
which
Mark
also
receive
without
the
least
abatement
of
his
equanimity
.
   
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
he
conduct
them
to
a
miserable
cabin
,
rudely
construct
of
the
trunk
of
tree
;
the
door
of
which
have
either
fall
down
or
be
carry
away
long

and
which
be
consequently
open

the
wild
landscape

the
dark
night

<EOS>
save
for
the
little
store
he
have
mention
,
it
be
perfectly
bare
of
all
furniture
;
but
they
have
leave
a
chest
upon
the
landing
-
place
,
and
he
give
them
a
rude
torch
in
lieu
of
candle
.
 
<EOS>
this
latter
acquisition
Mark
plant
in
the
earth
,

then
declare
that

mansion

look

comfortable

Martin
off
again

bring
up
the
chest

<EOS>
and
all
the
way
to
the
landing

place
and
back
,
Mark
talk
incessantly
;
as
if
he
would
infuse
into
his
partner

breast
some
faint
belief
that
they
have
arrive
under
the
most
auspicious
and
cheerful
of

imaginable
circumstance

many

when

Martin
lay
down

aloud

<EOS>
there
be
no

he
speak
the
truth

for
the
extraordinary
alarm
with
which
he
look
at

as
he
pause
upon
his
knee
before

chest

in
the
act

unlock

there
must

my
noble

the
Board
of

<EOS>
Lord
bless
you

sir
<EOS>

it
be
very
like
a
gipsy
party

"
   
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
not
to
take
heart
,
in
the
company
of
such
a
man
as
this
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
sit
upon
the
ground
beside
the
box
;
take
out
his
knife
;
and
eat
and
drink
sturdily
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
you
see
,
"
say
Mark
,
when
they
have
make
a
hearty
meal
;
"
with
your
knife
and
mine
,
I
stick
this
blanket
right
afore
the
door

or
where

high
civilization

the
door
would
be

very
neat

what
be

hinder
our
pass
a
good
night

"
   
<EOS>
for
all
his
light
-
hearted
speaking
,
it
be
long
before
he
sleep
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
wrap
his
blanket
round
him
,
put
the
axe
ready
to
his
hand
,
and
lie
across
the
threshold
of
the
door
;
too
anxious
and
too
watchful
to
close
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
the
novelty
of
their
dreary
situation
,
the
dread
of
some
rapacious
animal
or
human
enemy
,
the
terrible
uncertainty
of
their
mean
of
subsistence
,
the
apprehension
of
death
,
the
immense
distance
and
the
host
of
obstacle
between
themselves
and
England
,
be
fruitful
source
of
disquiet
in
the
deep
silence
of
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
though
Martin
would
have
have
him
think
<EOS>
otherwise
,
Mark
feel
that
he
be
wake
also
,
and
a
prey
to
the
same
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
almost
bad
than
all
,
for
if
he
begin
to
brood
over
their
misery
instead
of
try
to
make
head
against
them
there
could
be
little
doubt
that
such
a
state
of
mind
would
powerfully
assist
the
influence
of
the
pestilent
climate
.
 
<EOS>
never
have
the
light
of
day
be
half
so
welcome
to
his
eye
,
<EOS>
as
when
awake
from
a
fitful
doze
,
Mark
see
it
shine
through
the
blanket
in
the
doorway
.
   
<EOS>
He
steal
out
gently
,
for
his
companion
be
sleep
now

and
have
refresh
himself
by
wash
in
the
river
,
where
it
snow
before
the
door

take
a
rough
survey
of
the
settlement
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
above
a
score
of
cabin
in
the
whole

half
of
these
appear
untenanted
;
all
be
rotten
and
decay

the
most
tottering

abject

forlorn
among

with
great
propriety

It
have
some
feeble
prop
about
it

be
settle
deep
down

past
all
recovery

<EOS>
here
and
there
an
effort
have
be
make
to
clear
the
land

and
something
like
a
field
have
be
mark
out

where

among

a
scanty

in

in
no

lie
moulder
away

<EOS>
three

four
meagre

some
long

legged

away
into
the
wood
in

of
food
;
some

nearly
naked

from

sicken

an
oven

rise
up

hang
on
everything
around

and
as
his

sink
into
the
marshy
ground
,
a
black
ooze
start
forth
to
blot
them
out

<EOS>
Their

mere
forest

<EOS>
the

grow
so

close

they
shoulder
one
another
out
of
their
place

and
the
weak

force
into
shape
of
strange
distortion

languish
like
cripple

<EOS>
the
good
be
stunt
,
from
the
pressure
and
the
want
of
room
;
and
high
about
the
stem
of
all
grow
long
rank
grass
,
dank
weed
,
and
frowsy
underwood
;
not
divisible
into
their
separate
kind
,
but
tangle
all
together
in
a
heap
;
a
jungle
deep
and
dark
,
with
neither
earth
nor
water
at
its
root
,
but
putrid
matter
,
form
of
the
pulpy
offal
of
the
two

and
of
their
own
corruption

<EOS>
He
go
down
to
the
landing
-
place
where
they
have
leave
their
good
last
night
;
and
there
he
find
some
half

dozen
man
---
wan
and
forlorn
to
look
at
,
but
ready
enough
to
assist

who
help
him
to
carry
them
to
the
log

house
.
 
<EOS>
They
shake
their
head
in
speak
of
the
settlement
,
and
have
no
comfort
to
give
him
.
 
<EOS>
those
who
have
the
mean
of
go
away
have
all
desert
it

<EOS>
They
who
be
leave
have
lose
their
wife
,
their
child

friend

brother
there
,
and
suffer
much
themselves

<EOS>
Most
of
them
be
ill
then
;
none
be
the
man
they
have
be
once

They
frankly
offer
their
assistance

leave
him
for

go
sadly
off
upon

greatly
change

even
in

He

very
pale

languid

dim

in

now

however
well
Mr

have
teach

the
lesson

that

be
anything

manly

engaging

<EOS>
perhaps
,
indeed
,
so
singular
a
mixture
of
defiance
and
obsequiousness
,
of
fear
and
hardihood
,
of
dog
sullenness
and
an
attempt
at
enrage
and
propitiation
,
never
be
express
in

human
figure

in

of

when
,
have
raise

he
let

fall

uneasily
close

unclose
his

intermission

stand
swinge
himself
from

wait

I

whisper
,
as
they
draw
their
chair
about
the
table
;

I
give

as
good

<EOS>
He
have
well
look
at
home
,
before
he
look
out

window

I
think
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
only
answer
by
a
nudge
of
the
elbow
,
which
may
either
be
construe
into
an
indignant
remonstrance
or
a
cordial
assent
;
but
which
,
in
any
case
,
be
an
emphatic
admonition
to
his
choose
son
-
in
-
law
to
be
silent
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
proceed
to
do
the
honour
of
the
house
with
his
accustomed
ease
and
amiability
.
   
<EOS>
but
not
even
Mr
Pecksniff
's
guileless
merriment
could
set
such
a
party
at
their
ease
,
or
reconcile
material
so
utterly
discordant
and
conflict
as
those
with
which
he
have
to
deal
.
 
<EOS>
the
unspeakable
jealously
and
hatred
which
that
night
's
explanation
have
sow
in
Charity
's
breast
,
be
not
to
be
so
easily
keep
down
;
and
more
than
once
it
show
itself
in
such
intensity
,
as
seem
to
render
a
full
disclosure

all
the
circumstance
then

there

impossible

the
beauteous
Merry

with
all
the
glory

her
conquest
fresh
upon

so

lance
the
rankling
disappointment
of
her
sister
by
her
capricious
air
and
thousand
little
trial
of
Mr
Jonas
's
obedience
,
that
she
almost
goad
her
into
a
fit
of
madness
,
and
oblige
her
to
retire
from
table
in
a
burst
of
passion
,
hardly
less
vehement
than
that
to
which
she
have
abandon
herself
in
the
first
tumult
of
her
wrath

the

manner

Mr

situation
be
peculiarly
try
;
for
,
<EOS>
what
with
have
constantly
to
keep
the
peace
between
his
daughter

to
maintain
a
reasonable
show
of
affection

unity
in

to
curb
the
grow
ease

gaiety
of
Jonas
,
which
vent
itself
in
sundry
insolence
towards
Mr
Pinch
,
and
an
indefinable
coarseness
of
manner
in
reference
to
Mary

to
make
no

to
smooth
down

away

some
of
the
ten
thousand
bad
appearance
and
combination
of
bad
appearance

by
which
they
be
surround
on
that
unlucky
evening

<EOS>
what
with
have
to
do
this
,
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
sum
up
how
much
more
,
without
the
least
relief
or
assistance
from
anybody
,
it
may
be
easily
imagine
that
Mr

have
in
his
enjoyment
something
more
than
that
usual
portion
of
alloy
which
be
mix
up
with
the
good
of
man
's
delight

<EOS>
perhaps
he
have
never
in
his
life
feel
such
relief
as
when
old
Martin
,
look
at
his
watch
,
announce
that
it
be

to
go

"
We

I
have
a
fancy
for

evening

the
night

dark

brief

I

<EOS>
Mr

already

it
be

"
I

"
It

he
feel

tremble
to
such
a
degree

that
he
find
it
difficult
to
hold
the

<EOS>
how
much
more
difficult
when
,
at
the
old
man

bidding
she
draw
her

<EOS>
on
the
way
,
"
you
be
very
comfortably
situate
here

be
you

"
   
<EOS>
Tom
answer
,
with
even
more
than
his
usual
enthusiasm
,
that
he
be
under
obligation
to
Mr

which
the
devotion
of
a
lifetime
would

imperfectly
repay

<EOS>
I
never
speak

him
before
to
-
night

sir

"
   
<EOS>
"
perhaps
half
a
lifetime
will
suffice
for
the
acknowledgment
of
his
kindness
,
"
observe
the
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
feel
that
this
be
a
rebuff
for
him
,
and
could
not
but
understand
it
as
a
left
-
handed
hit
at
his
employer
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
be
silent
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
feel
that
Mr
Pinch
be
not
remarkable
for
presence
of
mind
,
and
that
he
could
not
say
too
little
under
exist
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
be
silent
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
man
,
disgust
by
what
in
his
suspicious
nature
he
consider
a
shameless
and
fulsome
puff
of
Mr
Pecksniff
,
which
be
a
part
of
Tom
's
hire
service
and
in
which
he
be
determined
to
persevere
,
set
him
down
at
once
for
a
deceitful

servile
,
miserable
fawner
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
be
silent
.
 
<EOS>
and
though
they
be
all
sufficiently
uncomfortable
,
it
be
fair
to
say
that
Martin
be
perhaps
the
most
so
;
for
he
have
feel
kindly
towards
Tom
at
first
,
and
have
be
interested
by
his
seeming
simplicity
.
   
<EOS>
"
You

he
think

glance
at

the
unconscious
Tom

"
You

first
among
the

nothing

embarrassment

confusion

<EOS>
They
part
at
the
Dragon
door
;
and
sigh
as
he
extinguish
the
candle
in
the
lantern
,
Tom
turn
back
again
over
the
gloomy
field
.
   
<EOS>
as
he
approach
the
first
stile

which
be
in

lonely
part
,
make
very
dark

a
plantation
of
young

past
him

go
on
before

come
to
the

rather
startled

for

stand
still

but
he
step
forward
again
immediately

go
close
up
to
him

<EOS>
It
be
Jonas
;
swinge
his
leg
to

fro
,
suck
the
head
of
a
stick
,
and
look
with
a
sneer

thought

that
there
should
be
any
such
tremendous
division
in

as
he
know
must
have
take
place
to
convert
Charity
Pecksniff
into
his
friend
,
for
any
reason

,
above
all

for
that
which
be
clearly
the
real
one

that
Jonas

who
have
assail
him
with
such
exceed
coarseness
,
should
have
be
sufficiently
magnanimous
to
keep
the
secret
of
their
quarrel
;

that
any
train
of
circumstance
should
have
lead
to
the
commission
of
an
assault
and
battery
by
Thomas
Pinch
upon
any
man
call
himself
the
friend
of
Seth
Pecksniff

be
matter

such
deep

painful
cogitation

he
could
not
close
his
eye

<EOS>
His
own
violence
,
in
particular
,
so
prey
upon
the
generous
mind
of
Tom

that
couple
it
with
the
many
former
occasion
on
which
he
have
give
Mr
Pecksniff
pain
and
anxiety
(
occasion
of
which
that
gentleman
often
remind
him
)
,
he
really
begin
to
regard
himself
as
destine
by
a
mysterious
fate
to
be
the
evil
genius
and
bad
angel
of
his
patron
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
fall
asleep
at
last
,
and
dream
---
new
source
of
wake
uneasiness
---
that
he
have
betray
his
trust
,
and
run
away
with
Mary
Graham
.
   
<EOS>
It
must
be
acknowledge
that

asleep

awake

Tom
's
position
in
reference
to
this
young
lady

full
of
uneasiness

<EOS>
the
more
he
see
of
her
,
the
more
he
admire
her
beauty
,
her
intelligence
,
the
amiable
quality
that
even
win
on
the
divided
house
of
Pecksniff
,
and
in
a
few
day
restore
,
at
all
event
,
the
semblance
of
harmony
and
kindness
between
the
angry
sister
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
speak
,
Tom
hold
his
breath
,
so
eagerly
he
listen
;
when
she
sing
,
he
sit
like
one
entrance
.
 
<EOS>
She
touch
his
organ
,
and
from
that
bright
epoch
even
it
,
the
old
companion
of

happy
hour

incapable
as
he
have
think
of
elevation

begin
a
new

deified
existence

through
half
the

night

the
jingling
anatomy
of
that
inscrutable
old

in
the
back
parlour

could
have
miss
the
entrance
to
thy
secret
heart
:
albeit
it
be
dimly
know
to
thee
?
 
<EOS>
who
that
have
see
the
glow
upon
thy
cheek
when
lean
down
to
listen
,
after
hour
of
labour
,
for
the
sound
of
one
incorrigible
note
,
thou
foundest
that
it
have
a
voice
at
last
,
and
wheeze
out
a
flat
something
,
distantly
akin
to
what
it
ought
to
be
,
would
not
have
know
that
it
be
destine
for
no
common
touch
,
but
one
that
smote
,
though
gently
as
an
angel
's
hand
,
upon
the
deep
chord
within
thee
!
 
<EOS>
and
if
a
friendly
glance
---
aye
,
even
though
it
be
as
guileless
as
thine
own
,
Dear
Tom
---
could
have
but
pierce
the
twilight
of
that
evening
,
when
,
in
a
voice
well
temper
to
the
time
,
sad
,
sweet
,
and
low
,
yet
hopeful
,
she
first
sing
to
the
alter
instrument
,
and
wonder
at
the
change
;
and
thou
,
sit
apart
at
the
open
window
,
keep
a
glad
silence
and
a
swell
heart
---
 
<EOS>
must
not
that
glance
have
read
perforce
the
dawning
of
a
story
,
Tom
,
that
it
be
well
for
thee
have
never
be
begin
!
   
<EOS>
Tom
Pinch
's
situation
be
not
make
the
less
dangerous
or
difficult
by
the
fact
of
no
one
word
pass
between
them
in
reference
to
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
honourably
mindful
of
his
promise
,
Tom
give
her
opportunity
of
all
kind
.
 
<EOS>
early
and
late
he
be
in
the
church
;
in
her
favourite
walk
;
in
the
village
,
in
the
garden
,
in
the
meadow
;
and
in
any
or
all
of
these
place
he
may
have
speak
freely
.
 
<EOS>
but
no
;
at
all
such
time
she
carefully
avoid
him
,
or
never
come
in
his
way
unaccompanied
.
 
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
that
she
dislike
or
distrust
him
,
for
by
a
thousand
little
delicate
mean
,
too
slight
for
any
notice
but
<EOS>
his
own
,
she
single
him
out
when
other
be
present
,
and
show
herself
the
very
soul
of
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
she
have
break
with
Martin
,
or
have
never
return
his
affection
,
save
in
his
own
bold
and
heighten
fancy
?
 
<EOS>
Tom
's
cheek
grow
red
with
self
-
reproach
as
he
dismiss
the
thought
.
   
<EOS>
all
this
time
old
Martin
come
and
go
in
his
own
strange
manner
,
or
sit
among
the
rest
absorb
within
himself
,
and
hold
little
intercourse
with
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
although
he
be
unsocial
,
he
be
not
willful
in
other
thing
,
or
troublesome
,
or
morose
;
be
never
better
pleased
than
when
they
leave
him
quite
unnoticed
at
his
book
,
and
pursue
their
own
amusement
in
his
presence
,
unreserved
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
discern
in
whom
he
take
an
interest
,
or
whether
he
have
an
interest
in
any
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
unless
they
speak
to
him
directly
,
he
never
show
that
he
have
ear
or
eye
for
anything
that
pass
.
   
<EOS>
one
day
the
lively
Merry
,
sit
with
downcast
eye
under
a
shady
tree
in
the
churchyard
,
whither
she
have
retire
after
fatigue
herself
by
the
imposition
of
sundry
trial
on
the
temper
of
Mr
Jonas
,
feel
that
a
new
shadow
come
between
her
and
the
sun
.
 
<EOS>
raise
her
eye
in
the
expectation
of
see
her
betroth
,
she
be
not
a
little
surprised
to
see
old
Martin
instead
.
 
<EOS>
Her
surprise
be
not
diminish
when
he
take
his
seat
upon
the
turf
beside
her
,
and
open
a
conversation
thus
:
   
<EOS>
"
when
be
you
to
be
marry
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
dear
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
my
goodness
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
do
not
know
.
 
<EOS>
not
yet
awhile
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
hope
?
"
say
the
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
very
gravely
say
,
but
she
take
it
for
banter
,
and
giggle
excessively
.
   
<EOS>
"
come
!
"
<EOS>
say
the
old
man
,
with
unusual
kindness
,
"
you
be
young
,
good
-
look
,
and
I
think
good
-
natured
!
 
<EOS>
frivolous
you
be
,
and
love
to
be
,
undoubtedly
;
but
you
must
have
some
heart
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
give
it
all
away
<EOS>
,
I
can
tell
you
,
"
say
Merry
,
nod
her
head
shrewdly
,
and
pluck
up
the
grass
.
   
<EOS>
"
have
you
part
with
any
of
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
throw
the
grass
about
,
and
look
another
way
,
but
say
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
repeat
his
question
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lor
,
my
dear
Mr
Chuzzlewit
!
<EOS>
really
you
must
excuse
me
!
 
<EOS>
how
very
odd
you
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
odd
in
me
to
desire
to
know
whether
you
love
the
young
man
whom
I
understand
you
be
to
marry
,
I
am
very
odd
,
"
say
Martin
.
<EOS>
"
for
that
be
certainly
my
wish
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
be
such
a
monster
,
you
know
,
"
say
Merry
,
pouting
.
   
<EOS>
"
then
you
do
not

him

"
return
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
that
your
meaning
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
my
dear
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
I
be
sure
I
tell
him
a
hundred
time
a
day
that
I
hate
him

<EOS>
You
must
have
hear
me
tell
him
that

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
often
,
"

Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
I
do
,
"
cry
Merry
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
positively
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
be
at
the

observe
the
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
yes
,
"
say
Merry
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
tell
the
wretch
---
<EOS>
my
dear
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
I
tell
him
when
he
ask
me
---
that
if
I
ever
do
marry
him
,
it
should
only
be
that
I
may
hate

tease
him
all
my
life

"
   
<EOS>
She
have
a
suspicion
that
the
old
man
regard
Jonas
with
anything
but
favour
,
and
intend
these
remark
to
be
extremely
captivate
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
appear
,
however
,
to
regard
them
in
that
light
by
any
mean
;
for
when
he
speak
again
,
it
be
in
a
tone
of
severity
.
   
<EOS>
"
look
about
you
,
"
he
say
,
point
to
the
grave
;
"
and
remember
that
from
your
bridal
hour
to
the
day

see
you
bring
as
low

these

lay
in
such
a
bed

there
will
be
no
appeal

him

speak

it

oh

good

<EOS>
My

Mr

it

accountable

vanity

It

,
all
along

the

dreadfully
jealous

"
not

I
see

there
be
one
chance

<EOS>
You
may
have
lapse
into
this
engagement
in
very
giddiness

It

be
the
wanton
act

be
that
so

My

steadily

slowly

in
a
softened
voice

would
still
invite
her
confidence

My

what
shocking

I

to
the
wicket

gate

out

execute

to
the
end
that
the
patient
may
not
be
disturb
by

line
,
Poll
get
on
tolerably
well
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
a
little
elderly
man
,
with
a
clammy
cold
right
hand
,
from
which
even
rabbit
and
bird
could
not
remove
the
smell
of
shaving
-
soap
.
 
<EOS>
Poll
have
something
of
the
bird
in
his
nature
;
not
of
the
hawk
or
eagle
,
but
of
the
sparrow
,
that
build
in
chimney
-
stack
and
incline
to
human
company
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
quarrelsome
,
though
,
like
the
sparrow
;
but
peaceful
,
like
the
dove
.
 
<EOS>
in
his
walk
he
strut
;
and
,
in
this
respect
,
he
bear
a
faint
resemblance
to
the
pigeon
,
as
well
as
in
a
certain
prosiness
of
speech
,
which
may
,
in
its
monotony
,
be
liken
to
the
cooing
of
that
bird
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
inquisitive
;
and
when
he
stand
at
his
shop
-
door
in
the
evening
-
tide
,
watch
the
neighbour
,
with
his
head
on
one
side
,
and
his
eye
cock
knowingly
,
there
be
a
dash
of
the
raven
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
yet
there
be
no
more
wickedness
in
Poll
than
in
a
robin
.
 
<EOS>
happily
,
too
,
when
any
of
his
ornithological
property
be
on
the
verge
of
go
too
far
,
they
be
quench
,
dissolve
,
melt
down
,
and
neutralise
in
the
barber
;
just
as
his
bald
head
---
<EOS>
otherwise
,
as
the
head
of
a
shave
magpie
---
 
lose
itself
in
a
wig
of
curly
black
ringlet
,
part
on
one
side
,
and
cut
away
almost
to
the
crown
,
to
indicate
immense
capacity
of
intellect
.
   
<EOS>
Poll
have
a
very
small
,
shrill
treble
voice
,
which
may
have
lead
the
wag
of
Kingsgate
Street
to
insist
the
more
upon
his
feminine
designation
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
tender
heart
,
too
;
for
,
when
he
have
a
good
commission
to
provide
three
or
four
score
sparrow
for
a
shooting
-
match
,
he
would
observe
,
in
a
compassionate
tone
,
how
singular
it
be
that
sparrow
should
have
be
make
expressly
for
such
purpose
.
<EOS>
the
question
,
whether
man
be
make
to
shoot
them
,
never
enter
into
Poll
's
philosophy
.
   
<EOS>
Poll
wear
,
in
his
sporting
character
,
a
velveteen
coat
,
a
great
deal
of
blue
stocking
,
ankle
boot
,
a
neckerchief
of
some
bright
colour
,
and
a
very
tall
hat
.
 
<EOS>
pursue
his
more
quiet
occupation
of
barber
,
he
generally
subside
into
an
apron
not
over

clean
,
a
flannel
jacket
,
and
corduroy
knee

short

<EOS>
It
be
in
this
latter
costume
,
but
with
his
apron
gird
round
his
waist
,
as
a
token
of
his

shut
up
shop
for
the
night
,
that
he
close
the
door
one
evening
,
some
week
after
the
occurrence
detail
in
the
last
chapter
,
and
stand
upon
the
step
in
Kingsgate
Street
,
listen
until
the
little
cracked
bell
within
should
leave
off
ring

<EOS>
for
until
it

<EOS>
this
be
Mr

reflection

the
place
never

quiet
enough
to

It

be
quiet
at

<EOS>
He
roll
his
apron
up
a
little
tight

with
frightful
emphasis

contain

<EOS>
as
he
talk
on

occasion
whether
he
have
anything
to
say

not

it
be
unanimously
observe
of
him
that
he
be
"
full
of
anecdote
;

his
experience
and
profit
from
it
be
consider
,
for
the
same
reason

to
be
something
much
too
extensive
for
description
.
 
<EOS>
His
female
patient
could
never
praise
him
too
highly
;
and
the
cold
of
his
male
admirer
would
always
say
this
for
him
to
their
friend
,
"
that
whatever
Jobling
's
professional
skill
may
be
(

it

high
reputation

most
comfortable
fellow
you
ever

"
   
<EOS>
Jobling
be
for
many
reason
,
and
not
last
in
the
list
because
his
connection
lie
principally
among
tradesman
and
their
family
,
exactly
the
sort
of
person
whom
the
Anglo
-
Bengalee
Company
want
for
a
medical
officer
.
 
<EOS>
but
Jobling
be
far
too
know
to
connect
himself
with
the
company
in
any
close
tie
than
as
a
pay
(
and
well
pay
)
functionary
,
or
to
allow
his
connection
to
be
misunderstood
abroad
,
if
he
could
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
hence
he
always
state
the
case
to
an
inquiring
patient
,
after
this
manner
:
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
my
dear

the
great
difficulty

revenge

be
remark

on

that
there
be
a
simplicity

cunne
no

simplicity

innocence

credulous

if

have
prefer
any
claim

high
and
honourable
dealing

Jonas
would
have
suspect
him

he
have
be
a
very
model
of
probity

but
when
he
give
utterance
to
Jonas
's
own
thought

begin
to
feel

change
his
position

chair

not
for

awkward

for
a
more
boastful
attitude

smile
in

miserable
conceit
rejoin

Mr

curiously
at

He
make
so
long
a
pause

that
Tigg
come
to
the
rescue
,
and
say
,
in
his
pleasantest
manner
:
   
<EOS>
"
take
a
glass
of
wine

"
   
<EOS>
"
no

no

with
a
cunning
shake
of
the
head

none

no
wine

<EOS>
all
very
well

it

not

<EOS>
"
what
an

Mr

lean
back

at
him
through
his
half

shut
eye

<EOS>
Jonas
shake
his
head
again
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
You
be
right
there
;

then
resume
,
jocosely
:
   
"
not
such
an
old
hand

either
,
but
that
I
have
be
and
get
married

<EOS>
that
be
rather
green
,
you
will
say

<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
,

young

one
never

be

fair

Jonas
receive
this
compliment
with
anything

a
good
grace
,
perhaps
because
of
his

private
sentiment
in
reference
to
the
personal
appearance

perhaps

be

<EOS>
Mr

ponder
for
some
moment

and
then

<EOS>
and

shut
the
board

room
door
after
him
,
as
carefully
as
if
he
be
about
to
plot
a
murder
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
the
man
at
a
pound
a
week
who
make
the
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
virtue
or
merit
in
Nadgett
that
he
transact
all
his
anglo

Bengalee
business
secretly
and
in
the
close
confidence
;
for
he
be
bear
to
be
a
secret
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
short
,
dry
-
up
,
withered
old
man
,
who
seem
to
have
secrete
his
very
blood
;
for
nobody
would
have
give
him
credit
for
the
possession
of
six
ounce
of

in
his
whole

.
<EOS>
how

where

and
even

<EOS>
in

musty
old
pocket

he
carry
contradictory

in
some
of
which
he
call
himself
a

,
in

<EOS>
a

,
in

a

in

a
collector

in

an

as
if
he
really
do
not
know
the
secret
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
always
keep
appointment
in
the
City
,
and
the
other
man
never
seem
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
sit
on
"
change
for
hour
,
look
at
everybody
who
walk
in
and
out
,
and
would
do
the
like
at
Garraway
's
,
and
in
other
business
coffee
-
room
,
in
some
of
which
he
would
be
occasionally
see
dry
a
very
damp
pocket

handkerchief
before
the
fire
,
and
still
look
over
his
shoulder
for
the
man
who
never
appear

<EOS>
He
be
mildew
,
threadbare
,
shabby
;
always
have
flue
upon
his
leg
and
back
;
and
keep
his
linen
so
secretly
button
up
and
wrap
over
,
that
he
may
have
have
none
---
perhaps
he
have
not

<EOS>
He
carry
one
stain
beaver
glove
,
which
he
dangle
before
him
by
the
forefinger
as
he
walk

but
even
its
fellow

a
secret

<EOS>
some
people
say
he
have
be
a
bankrupt
,
other
that
he
have

in
corner
box
of
the
trysting
-
place
before
mention
;
but
they
never
appear
to
go
to
anybody
,
for
he
would
put
them
into
a
secret
place
in
his
coat
,
and
deliver
them
to
himself
week
afterwards
,
very
much
to
his

surprise
,
quite
yellow

<EOS>
He

everybody
would
have

perfectly
satisfy
,
and
would
have
say
it

just
as
they
expect

<EOS>
and
yet
he
belong
to
a
class
;
a
race
peculiar
to
the
City

who
be
secret
as
profound
to
one

<EOS>
large

he

clasp

carefully

solemn

Chapter
28
.
<EOS>
Mr
Montague
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
and
Mr
Jonas
Chuzzlewit
at
home
 
<EOS>
there
be
many
powerful
reason
for
Jonas
Chuzzlewit
be
strongly
prepossess
in
favour
of
the
scheme
which
its
great
originator
have
so
boldly
lay
open
to
him
;
but
three
among
them
stand
prominently
forward
.
 
<EOS>
firstly
,
there
be
money
to
be
make
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
secondly
,
the
money
have
the
peculiar
charm
of
be
sagaciously
obtain
at
other
people
's
cost
.
 
<EOS>
thirdly
,
it
involve
much
outward
show
of
homage
and
distinction
:
a
board
be
an
awful
institution
in
its
own
sphere
,
and
a
director
a
mighty
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
to
make
a
swinge
profit
,
have
a
lot
of
chap
to
order
about
,
and
get
into
regular
good
society
by
one
and
the
same
mean
,
and
them
so
easy
to
one
's
hand
,
be
not
such
a
bad
look
-
out
,
"
think
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
the
latter
consideration
be
only
second
to
his
avarice
;
for
,
conscious
that
there
be
nothing
in
his
person
,
conduct
,
character
,
or
accomplishment
,
to
command
respect
,
he
be
greedy
of
power
,
and
be
,
in
his
heart
,
as
much
a
tyrant
as
any
laurele
conqueror
on
record
.
   
<EOS>
but
he
determine
to
proceed
with
cunning
and
caution
,
and
to
be
very
keen
on
his
observation
of
the
gentility
of
Mr
Montague
's
private
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
for
it
no
more
occur
to
this
shallow
knave
that
Montague
want
him
to
be
so
,
or
he
would
not
have
invite
him
while
his
decision
be
yet
in
abeyance
,
than
the
possibility
of
that
genius
be
able
to
overreach
him
in
any
way
,
pierce
through
his
self
-
deceit
by
the
inlet
of
a
needle
's
point
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
say
,
in
the
outset
,
that
Jonas
be
too
sharp
for
him
;
and
Jonas
,
who
would
have
be
sharp
enough
to
believe
him
in
nothing
else
,
though
he
have
solemnly
swear
it
,
believe
him
in
that
,
instantly
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
with
a
falter
hand
,
and
yet
with
an
imbecile
attempt
at
a
swagger
,
that
he
knock
at
his
new
friend
's
door
in
Pall
Mall
when
the
appoint
hour
arrive
.

Mr

"

Mr

with

incontestable
proof

Mr

<EOS>
Pip
,
in
a
natural
spirit

emulation

then
relate
some
instance
of

depth

Wolf
not

be
leave
behind

recite
the
lead
point

humorous

to

it

<EOS>
It
be
so
pleasant
to
find
real
merit
appreciate

whatever
its

may
be
,
that
the
general
harmony

gallant
defender

particularly
the
former

<EOS>
the
least
of
their
story
have
a
colonel
in
it

lord
be
as
plentiful
as

and
even
the
Blood
Royal
run
in

muddy
channel

"
Mr

reminiscence

no

Juliet

why

in

all
Miss
Biffins

<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
what
it

<EOS>
what
the
people
call
dramatic

collection
of

do

I

proud
to
say

"
add
Pip

"
that
he
do
stand
by
me
,
handsomely

"
   
<EOS>
the
conversation
now
become
general
,
Mr
Jonas
's
opinion
be
request
on
this
subject
;
and
as
it
be
in
full
accordance
with
the
sentiment
of
Mr
Pip
,
that
gentleman
be
extremely
gratified
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
both
himself
and
Wolf
have
so
much
in
common
with
Jonas
,
that
they
become
very
amicable
;
and
between
their
increase
friendship
and
the
fume
of
wine
,
Jonas
grow
talkative
.
   
<EOS>
It
do
not
follow
in
the
case
of
such
a
person
that
the
more
talkative
he
become
,
the
more
agreeable
he
be
;
on
the
contrary
,
his
merit
show
to
most
advantage
,
perhaps
,
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
have
no
mean
,
as
he
think
,
of
put
himself
on
an
equality
with
the
rest
,
but
by
the
assertion
of
that
depth
and
sharpness
on
which
he
have
be
compliment
,
Jonas
exhibit
that
faculty
to
the
utmost
;
and
be
so
deep
and
sharp
that
he
lose
himself
in
his
own
profundity
,
and
cut
his
finger
with
his
own
edge
-
tool
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
especially
in
his
way
and
character
to
exhibit
his
quality
at
his
entertainer
's
expense
;
and
while
he
drink
of
his
sparkling
wine
,
and
partook
of
his
monstrous
profusion
,
to
ridicule
the
extravagance
which
have
set
such
costly
fare
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
even
at
such
a
wanton
board
,
and
in
such
more
than
doubtful
company
,
this
may
have
prove
a
disagreeable
experiment
,
but
that
Tigg
and
Crimple
,
study
to
understand
their
man
thoroughly
,
give
him
what
license
he
choose
:
know
that
the
more
he
take
,
the
well
for
their
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
and
thus
while
the
blunder
cheat
---
gull
that
he
be
,
for
all
his
cunning
---
think
himself
roll
up
hedgehog
fashion
,
with
his
sharp
point
towards
them
<EOS>
,
he
be
,
in
fact
,
betray
all
his
vulnerable
part
to
their
unwinking
watchfulness
.
   
<EOS>
whether
the
two
gentleman
who
contribute
so
much
to
the
doctor
's
philosophical
knowledge
(
by
the
way
,
the
doctor
slip
off
quietly
,
after
swallow
his
usual
amount
of
wine
)
have
have
their
cue
distinctly
from
the
host
,
or
take
it
from
what
they
see
and
hear
,
they
act
their
part
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
They
solicit
the
honour
of
Jonas
's
well
acquaintance
;
trust
that
they
would
have
the
pleasure
of
introduce
him
into
that
elevated
society
in
which
he
be
so
well
qualified
to
shine
;
and
inform
him
,
in
the
most
friendly
manner
that
the
advantage
of
their
respective
establishment
be
entirely
at
his
control
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
they
say
"
be
one
of
us
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
Jonas
say
he
be
infinitely
oblige
to
them
,
and
he
would
be
;
add
within
himself
,
that
so
long
as
they
"
stand
treat
,
"
there
be
nothing
he
would
like
better
.
   
<EOS>
after
coffee
,
which
be
serve
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
there
be
a
short
interval
(
mainly
sustain
by
Pip
and
Wolf
)
of
conversation
;
rather
highly
spice
and
strongly
season
.
 
<EOS>
when
it
flag
,
Jonas
take
it
up
and
show
considerable
humour
in
appraise
the
furniture
;
inquire
whether
such
an
article
be
pay
for
;
what
it
have
originally
cost
,
and
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
in
all
of
this
,
he
be
,
as
he
consider
,
desperately
hard
on
Montague
,
and
very
demonstrative
of
his
own
brilliant
part
.
   
<EOS>
some
Champagne
Punch
give
a
new
though
temporary
fillip
to
the
entertainment
of
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
for
after
lead
to
some
noisy
proceeding
,
which
be
not
intelligible
,
it
end
in
the
unsteady
departure
of
the
two
gentleman
of
the
world
,
and
the
slumber
of
Mr
Jonas
upon
one
of
the
sofa
.
   
<EOS>
as
he
could
not
be
make
to
understand
where
he
be
,
Mr
Bailey
receive
order
to
call
a
hackney
-
coach
,
and
take
him
home
;
which
that
young
gentleman
rouse
himself
from
an
uneasy
sleep
in
the
hall
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
now
almost
three
o'clock
in
the
morning

<EOS>
"
be

you
think

"
<EOS>
whisper
Crimple
,
as
himself
and
partner
stand
in
a
distant
part
of
the
room
observe
him
as

the
box

particular
satisfaction

in
a
knock
the
like
of
which

quarter
since

to

put
his

It

the
merry
one

sadly
,
strangely
alter

deject

so
faltering

full
of
fear

so
fallen

break
;
that
to
have

her
quiet
in

would
have
be
a
less
surprise

<EOS>
She
set
the
light
upon
a
bracket
in
the
hall
,
and
lay
her
hand
upon
her
heart
;
upon
her
eye
;
upon
her
burn
head
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
come
on
towards
the
door
with
such
a
wild
and
hurried
step

possession

<EOS>
at
first
,
John
gaze
at
him
in
great

but
remember
how
very
much
reduce
he
be

and
how
recently
his

have
be
on

with

believe

despondent
fancy

<EOS>
for

information
on

<EOS>
this
almost
confirm
John
in
his
suspicion
;
so
,
not
take
what
have
pass
into
any
serious
account
,
he
resume
his
former
cheerful
manner
,
and
assist
by
Mrs

and
Betsey
Prig
,
conduct
Lewsome

be
slowly
move
into
the
vehicle

<EOS>
His
bony
hand
and
haggard
face
impress
Poll
wonderfully
;

he
inform
Mr

in
confidence
,
that
he
would
not

Mr

remark
that
he
would
have
stay
away
for
five
shilling

<EOS>
It
be
a
troublesome
matter
to
adjust

to
have
no

luggage
near
it

on
pain
of
action
at

for
heavy
damage
against
the
proprietor
of

<EOS>
the
umbrella
with
the
circular
patch

particularly
hard
to

get
rid
of

and
several
time
thrust
out
its
battered
brass
nozzle
from
improper
crevice

indeed

in

five
minute

that
it
seem
not
one
umbrella
but
fifty
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
it
be
lose
,
or
say
to
be
;
and
for
the
next
five
minute
she
be
face
to
face
with
the
coachman
,
go
wherever
he
may
,
protest
that

a

ask
pardon

I

it
do
not
at

soften
Miss

;
perhaps
because
her

not
rugge
enough

<EOS>
on

she
persist

over

no

hold
out

It

quite
right
that

I

Mr

<EOS>
It
be

see
in
Mrs

be
a
vision
of
enthusiastic
man

pine
to
fall
in
adoration
at

<EOS>
It
be
possible
that
Mr

,
in
his

bear
juvenility
,
see
,
in
the
suggestion
of
that

establishment

an
easy
mean
of
relieve
himself
from
an
irksome
charge
in
the
way
of
temper

watchfulness

<EOS>
It
be
undoubtedly
a
fact
that
in
the
attentive
ear
of
Mr
Pecksniff
,
the
proposition
do
not
sound
quite
like
the
dismal
knell

he
be
a
man

Mr

<EOS>
do
not

Mr

with
emotion

I
shall
get

<EOS>
Miss
Charity
,
who
know
he
have
a
secret
pleasure
in
the
contemplation
of
the
propose
change
,
suppress
her
own
,
and
go
on
to
negotiate
the
term
.
 
<EOS>
His
view
upon
this
subject
be
at
first
so
very
limited
that
another
difference
,
involve
possibly
another
shaking
,
threaten
to
ensue
;
but
by
degree
they
come
to
something
like
an
understanding
,
and
the
storm
blow
over
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
Miss
Charity
's
idea
be
so
agreeable
to
both
,
that
it
would
have
be
strange
if
they
have
not
come
to
an
amicable
agreement
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
soon
arrange
between
them
that
the
project
should
be
try
,
and
that
immediately
;
and
that
Cherry
be
not
be
well
,
and
need
change
of
scene
,
and
wish
to
be
near
her
sister
,
<EOS>
should
form
the
excuse
for
her
departure
to
Mr
Chuzzlewit
and
Mary
,
to
both
of
whom
she
have
plead
indisposition
for
some
time
past
.
 
<EOS>
these
premise
agree
on
,
Mr
Pecksniff
give
her
his
blessing
,
with
all
the
dignity
of
a
self
-
deny
man
who
have
make
a
hard
sacrifice
,
but
comfort
himself
with
the
reflection
that
virtue
be
its
own
reward
.
 
<EOS>
thus
they
be
reconcile
for
the
first
time
since
that
not
easily
forgive
night
,
when
Mr
Jonas
,
repudiate
the
elder
,
have
confess
his
passion
for
the
young
sister
,
and
Mr
Pecksniff
have
abet
him
on
moral
ground
.
   
<EOS>
but
how
happen
it
---
in
the
name
of
an
unexpected
addition
to
that
small
family
,
the
Seven
Wonders
of
the
World
,
whatever
and
wherever
they
may
be
,
how
happen
it
---
that
Mr
Pecksniff
and
his
daughter
be
about
to
part
?
 
<EOS>
how
happen
it
that
their
mutual
relation
be
so
greatly
alter
?
 
<EOS>
why
be
Miss
Pecksniff
so
clamorous
to
have
it
understand
that
she
be
neither
blind
nor
foolish
,
and
she
would
not
bear
it
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
possible
that
Mr
Pecksniff
have
any
thought
of
marry
again
;
or
that
his
daughter
,
with
the
sharp
eye
of
a
single
woman
,
fathom
his
design
!
   
<EOS>
let
us
inquire
into
this
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
,
as
a
man
without
reproach
,
from
whom
the
breath
of
slander
pass
like
common
breath
from
any
other
polished
surface
,
could
afford
to
do
what
common
man
could
not
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
the
purity
of
his
own
motive
;
and
when
he
have
a
motive
work
at
it
as
only
a
very
good
man
(
or
a
very
bad
one
)
can
.
 
<EOS>
do
he
set
before
himself
any
strong
and
palpable
motive
for
take
a
second
wife
?
 
<EOS>
yes
;
and
not
one
or
two
of
them
,
but
a
combination
of
very
many
.
   
<EOS>
Old
Martin
Chuzzlewit
have
gradually
undergo
an
important
change
.
<EOS>
even
upon
the
night
when
he
make
such
an
ill
-
time
arrival
at
Mr
Pecksniff
's
house
,
he
be
comparatively
subdue
and
easy
to
deal
with
.
 
<EOS>
this
Mr
Pecksniff
attribute
,
at
the
time
,
to
the
effect
his
brother
's
death
have
have
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
from
that
hour
his
character
seem
to
have
modify
by
regular
degree
,
and
to
have
soften
down
into
a
dull
indifference
for
almost
every
one
but
Mr
Pecksniff
.
<EOS>
His
look
be
much
the
same
as
ever
,
but
his
mind
be
singularly
alter
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
this
or
that
passion
stand
out
in
bright
or
in
dimmer
hue
;
but
that
the
colour
of
the
whole
man
be
fade
.
<EOS>
as
one
trait
disappear
,
no
other
trait
spring
up
to
take
its
place
.
 
<EOS>
His
sense
dwindle
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
less
keen
of
sight
;
be
deaf
sometimes
;
take
little
notice
of
what
pass
before
him
;
and
would
be
profoundly
taciturn
for
day
together
.
 
<EOS>
the
process
of
this
alteration
be
so
easy
that
almost
as
soon
as
it
begin
to
be
observe
it
be
complete
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mr
Pecksniff
see
it
first
,
and
have
Anthony
Chuzzlewit
fresh
in
his
recollection
,
see
in
his
brother
Martin
the
same
process
of
decay
.
   
<EOS>
to
a
gentleman
of
Mr
Pecksniff
's
tenderness
,
this
be
a
very
mournful
sight
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
but
foresee
the
probability
of
his
respected
relative
being
make
the
victim
of
designing
person
,
and
of
his
rich
fall
into
worthless
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
give
him
so
much
pain
that
he
resolve
to
secure
the
property
to
himself
;
to
keep
bad
testamentary
suitor
at
a
distance
;
to
wall
up
the
old
gentleman
,
as
it
be
,
for
his
own
use
.
 
<EOS>
by
little
and
little
,
therefore
,
he
begin
to
try
whether
Mr
Chuzzlewit
give
any
promise
of
become
an
instrument
in
his
hand
,
and
find
that
he
do
,
and
indeed
that
he
be
very
supple
in
his
plastic
finger
,
he
make
it
the
business
of
his
life
---
kind
soul
!
---
to
establish
an
ascendancy
over
him
;
and
every
little
test
he
durst
apply
meeting
with
a
success
beyond
his
hope
<EOS>
,
he
begin
to
think
he
hear
old
Martin
's
cash
already
chink
in
his
own
unworldly
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
but
when
Mr
Pecksniff
ponder
on
this
subject
(
as
,
in
his
zealous
way
,
he
often
do
)
,
and
think
with
an
uplifted
heart
of
the
train
of
circumstance
which
have
deliver
the
old
gentleman
into
his
hand
for
the
confusion
of
evil
-
doer
and
the
triumph
of
a
righteous
nature
<EOS>
,
he
always
feel
that
Mary
Graham
be
his
stumbling
-
block
.
<EOS>
let
the
old
man
say
what
he
would
,
Mr
Pecksniff
know
he
have
a
strong
affection
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
show
it
in
a
thousand
little
way
;
that
he
like
to
have
her
near
him
,
and
be
never
quite
at
ease
when
she
be
absent
long
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
have
ever
really
swear
to
leave
her
nothing
in
his
will
,
Mr
Pecksniff
greatly
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
that
even
if
he
have
,
there
be
many
way
by
which
he
could
evade
the
oath
and
satisfy
his
conscience
,
Mr
Pecksniff
know
.
 
<EOS>
that
her
unprotected
state
be
no
light
burden
on
the
old
man
's
mind
<EOS>
,
he
also
know
,
for
Mr
Chuzzlewit
have
plainly
tell
him
so
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
,
"
say
Mr
Pecksniff
"
<EOS>
what
if
I
marry
her
!
 
<EOS>
what
,
"
repeat
Mr
Pecksniff
,
stick
up
his
hair
and
glance
at
his
bust
by
Spoker
;
"
what
<EOS>
if
,
make
sure
of
his
approval
first
---
he
be
nearly
imbecile
,
poor
gentleman
---
I
marry
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
have
a
lively
sense
of
the
beautiful
;
especially
in
woman
.
 
<EOS>
His
manner
towards
the
sex
be
remarkable
for
its
insinuating
character
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
record
of
him
in
another
part
of
these
page
,
that
he
embrace
Mrs
Todgers
on
the
small
provocation
;
and
it
be
a
way
he
have
;
it
be
a
part
of
the
gentle
placidity
of
his
disposition
.
 
<EOS>
before
any
thought
of
matrimony
be
in
his
mind
,
he
have
bestow
on
Mary
many
little
token
of
his
spiritual
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
be
indignantly
receive
,
but
that
be
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
true
,
as
the
idea
expand
within
him
,
these
have
become
too
ardent
to
escape
the
pierce
eye
of
Cherry
,
who
read
his
scheme
at
once
;
but
he
have
always
feel
the
power
of
Mary
's
charm
.
<EOS>
so
Interest
and
Inclination
make
a
pair
,
and
draw
the
curricle
of
Mr
Pecksniff
's
plan
.
   
<EOS>
as
to
any
thought
of
revenge
himself
on
young
Martin
for
his
insolent
expression
when
they
part
,
and
of
shut
him
out
still
more
effectually
from
any
hope
of
reconciliation
with
his
grandfather
,
Mr
Pecksniff
be
much
too
meek
and
forgiving
to
be
suspect
of
harbour
it
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
be
refuse
by
Mary
,
Mr
Pecksniff
be
quite
satisfied
that
in
her
position
she
could
never
hold
out
if
he
and
Mr
Chuzzlewit
be
both
against
her
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
consult
the
wish
of
her
heart
in
such
a
case
,
it
form
no
part
of
Mr
Pecksniff
's
moral
code
;
for
he
know
what
a
good
man
he
be
,
and
what
a
blessing
he
must
be
to
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
His
daughter
have
break
the
ice
,
and
the
murder
be
out
between
them
,
Mr
Pecksniff
have
now
only
to
pursue
his
design
as
cleverly
as
he
could
,
and
by
the
crafty
approach
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
good
sir
,
"
say
Mr
Pecksniff
,
meet
old
Martin
in
the
garden
,
for
it
be
his
habit
to
walk
in
and
out
by
that
way
,
as
the
fancy
take
him
;

He

in

duty

discharge
a
duty
which
he
owe
to
society
 
<EOS>
the
closing
word
of
the
last
chapter
lead
naturally
to
the
commencement
of
this
,
its
successor
;
for
it
have
to
do
with
a
church
.
<EOS>
with
the
church
,
so
often
mention
heretofore
,
in
which
Tom
Pinch
play
the
organ
for
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
one
sultry
afternoon
,
about
a
week
after
Miss
Charity
's
departure
for
London
,
Mr
Pecksniff
be
out
walk
by
himself
,
take
it
into
his
head
to
stray
into
the
churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
be
linger
among
the
tombstone
,
endeavour
to
extract
an
available
sentiment
or
two
from
the
epitaph
---
for
he
never
lose
an
opportunity
of
make
up
a
few
moral
cracker
,
to
be
let
off
as
occasion
serve
---
Tom
Pinch
begin
to
practice
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
could
run
down
to
the
church
and
do
so
whenever
he
have
time
to
spare
;
for
it
be
a
simple
little
organ
,
provide
with
wind
by
the
action
of
the
musician
's
foot
;
and
he
be
independent
,
even
of
a
bellow
-
blower
.
 
<EOS>
though
if
Tom
have
want
one
at
any
time
,
there
be
not
a
man
or
boy
in
all
the
village
,
and
away
to
the
turnpike
(
tollman
include
)
,
but
would
have
blow
away
for
him
till
he
be
black
in
the
face
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
have
no
objection
to
music
;
not
the
least
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
tolerant
of
everything
;
he
often
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
He
consider
it
a
vagabond
kind
of
trifling
,
in
general
,
just
suited
to
Tom
's
capacity
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
regard
to
Tom
's
performance
upon
this
same
organ
,
he
be
remarkably
lenient
,
singularly
amiable
;
for
when
Tom
play
it
on
Sundays
,
Mr
Pecksniff
in
his
unbounded
sympathy
feel
as
if
he
play
it
himself
,
and
be
a
benefactor
to
the
congregation
.
 
<EOS>
so
whenever
it
be
impossible
to
devise
any
other
mean
of
take
the
value
of
Tom
's
wage
out
of
him
,
Mr
Pecksniff
give
him
leave
to
cultivate
this
instrument
.
 
<EOS>
for
which
mark
of
his
consideration
<EOS>
Tom
be
very
grateful
.
   
<EOS>
the
afternoon
be
remarkably
warm
,
and
Mr
Pecksniff
have
be
stroll
a
long
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
what
may
be
call
a
fine
ear
for
music
,
but
he
know
when
it
have
a
tranquilizing
influence
on
his
soul
;
and
that
be
the
case
now
,
for
it
sound
to
him
like
a
melodious
snore
.
 
<EOS>
He
approach
the
church
,
and
look
through
the
diamond
lattice
of
a
window
near
the
porch
,
see
Tom
,
with
the
curtain
in
the
loft
draw
back
,
play
away
with
great
expression
and
tenderness
.
   
<EOS>
the
church
have
an
inviting
air
of
coolness
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
oak
roof
support
by
cross
-
beam
,
the
hoary
wall
,
the
marble
tablet
,
and
the
crack
stone
pavement
,
be
refreshing
to
look
at
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
leave
of
ivy
tap
gently
at
the
opposite
window
;
and
the
sun
pour
in
through
only
one
;
leave
the
body
of
the
church
in
tempt
shade
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
most
tempting
spot
of
all
,
be
one
red
-
curtained
and
soft
-
cushion
pew
,
wherein
the
official
dignitary
of
the
place
(
of
whom
Mr
Pecksniff
be
the
head
and
chief
)
<EOS>
enshrine
themselves
on
Sundays
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
's
seat
be
in
the
corner
;
a
remarkably
comfortable
corner
;
where
his
very
large
Prayer
-
Book
be
at
that
minute
make
the
most
of
its
quarto
self
upon
the
desk
.
 
<EOS>
He
determine
to
go
in
and
rest
.
   
<EOS>
He
enter
very
softly
;
in
part
because
it
be
a
church
;
in
part
because
his
tread
be
always
soft
;
in
part
because
Tom
play
a
solemn
tune
;
in
part
because
he
think
he
would
surprise
him
when
he
stop
.
 
<EOS>
unbolt
the
door
of
the
high
pew
of
state
,
he
glide
in
and
shut
it
after
him
;
then
sit
in
his
usual
place
,
and
stretch
out
his
leg
upon
the
hassock
,
he
compose
himself
to
listen
to
the
music
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
an
unaccountable
circumstance
that
he
should
have
feel
drowsy
there
,
where
the
force
of
association
may
surely
have
be
enough
to
keep
him
wide
awake
;
but
he
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
in
the
snug
little
corner
five
minute
before
he
begin
to
nod
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
recover
himself
one
minute
before
he
begin
to
nod
again
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
very
act
of
open
his
eye
indolently
,
he
nod
again
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
very
act
of
shut
them
,
he
nod
again
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
fall
out
of
one
nod
into
another
until
<EOS>
at
last
he
cease
to
nod
at
all
,
and
be
as
fast
as
the
church
itself
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
a
consciousness
of
the
organ
,
long
after
he
fall
asleep
,
though
as
to
its
be
an
organ
he
have
no
more
idea
of
that
than
he
have
of
its
be
a
bull
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
while
he
begin
to
have
at
interval
the
same
dreamy
impression
of
voice
;
and
awaken
to
an
indolent
curiosity
upon
the
subject
,
open
his
eye
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
so
indolent
,
that
after
glance
at
the
hassock
and
the
pew
,
he
be
already
half
-
way
off
to
sleep
again
,
when
it
occur
to
him
that
there
really
be
voice
in
the
church
;
low
voice
,
talk
earnestly
hard
by
;
while
the
echo
seem
to
mutter
response
.
 
<EOS>
He
rouse
himself
,
and
listen
.
   
<EOS>
before
he
have
listen
half
a
dozen
second
,
he
become
as
broad
awake
as
ever
he
have
be
in
all
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
with
eye
,
and
ear
,
and
mouth
,
wide
open
,
he
move
himself
a
very
little
with
the
utmost
caution
,
and
gather
the
curtain
in
his
hand
,
peep
out
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
Pinch
and
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
recognize
their
voice
,
and
already
know
the
topic
they
discuss
.
 
<EOS>
look
like
the
small
end
of
a
guillotined
man
,
with
his
chin
on
a
level
with
the
top
of
the
pew
,
so
that
he
may
duck
down
immediately
in
case
of
either
of
them
turn
round
,
he
listen
.
 
<EOS>
listen
with
such
concentrated
eagerness
,
that
his
very
hair
and
shirt
-
collar
stand
bristle
up
to
help
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
no

cry
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
letter

ever
reach

York

do
not

uneasy
on
that
account

for
it

very
likely

have
go
away

some
far

off
place
,
where
the

neither
regular

<EOS>
He

be
a
true

you

express

dissent

,
what
be
he
---
<EOS>
who
,
think
he
could
compass
these
design
the
well
if
I
be
his
wife
,
assail
me
with
the
coward
's
argument
that
if
I
marry
him
,
Martin
,
on
whom
I
have
bring
so
much
misfortune
,
shall
be
restore
to
something
of
his
former
hope
;
and
if
I
do
not
,
shall
be
plunge
in
deep
ruin
?
<EOS>
what
be
he
who
make
my
very
constancy
to
one
I
love
with
all
my
heart
a
torture
to
myself
and
wrong
to
him
;
who
make
me
,
do
what
I
will
,
the
instrument
to
hurt
a
head
I
would
heap
blessing
on
!
 
<EOS>
what
be
he
who
,
wind
all
these
cruel
snare
about
me
,
explain
their
purpose
to
me
,
with
a
smooth
tongue
and
a
smile
face
,
in
the
broad
light
of
day
;
drag
me
on
,
the
while
,
in
his
embrace
,
and
hold
to
his
lip
a
hand
,
"
pursue
the
agitated
girl
,
extend
it
,
"
which
I
would
have
strike
off
,
if
with
it
I
could
lose
the
shame
and
degradation
of
his
touch
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
cry
Tom
,
in
great
excitement
,
"
he
be
a
scoundrel
and
a
villain
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
who
he
be
,
I
say
he
be
a
double
-
dyed
and
most
intolerable
villain
!
"
   
<EOS>
cover
her
face
with
her
hand
again
,
as
if
the
passion
which
have
sustain
her
through
these
disclosure
lose
itself
in
an
overwhelming
sense
of
shame
and
grief
,
she
abandon
herself
to
tear
.
   
<EOS>
any
sight
of
distress
be
sure
to
move
the
tenderness
of
Tom
,
but
this
especially
.
 
<EOS>
tear
and
sobs
from
her
be
arrow
in
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
try
to
comfort
her
;
sit
down
beside
her
;
expend
all
his
store
of
homely
eloquence
;
and
speak
in
word
of
praise
and
hope
of
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
Aye
,
though
he
love
her
from
his
soul
with
such
a
self
-
deny
love
as
woman
seldom
win
;
he
speak
from
first
to
last
of
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
not
the
wealth
of
the
rich
Indies
would
have
tempt
Tom
to
shirk
one
mention
of
her
lover
's
name
.
   
<EOS>
when
she
be
more
composed
,
she
impress
upon
Tom
that
this
man
she
have
describe
,
be
Pecksniff
in
his
real
colour
;
and
word
by
word
and
phrase
by
phrase
,
as
well
as
she
remember
it
,
relate
what
have
pass
between
them
in
the
wood
:
which
be
no
doubt
a
source
of
high
gratification
to
that
gentleman
himself
,
who
in
his
desire
to
see
and
his
dread
of
be
see
,
be
constantly
dive
down
into
the
state
pew
,
and
come
up
again
like
the
intelligent
householder
in
Punch
's
Show
,
who
avoid
be
knock
on
the
head
with
a
cudgel
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
conclude
her
account
,
and
have
beseech
Tom
to
be
very
distant
and
unconscious
in
his
manner
towards
her
after
this
explanation
,
and
have
thank
him
very
much
,
they
part
on
the
alarm
of
footstep
in
the
burial
-
ground
;
and
Tom
be
leave
alone
in
the
church
again
.
   
<EOS>
and
now
the
full
agitation
and
misery
of
the
disclosure
come
rush
upon
Tom
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
the
star
of
his
whole
life
from
boyhood
have
become
,
in
a
moment
,
putrid
vapour
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
Pecksniff
,
Tom
's
Pecksniff
,
have
cease
to
exist
,
but
that
he
never
have
exist
.
<EOS>
in
his
death
Tom
would
have
have
the
comfort
of
remember
what
he
use
to
be
,
but
in
this
discovery
,
he
have
the
anguish
of
recollect
what
he
never
be
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
as
Tom
's
blindness
in
this
matter
have
be
total
and
not
partial
,
so
be
his
restore
sight
.
<EOS>
his
Pecksniff
could
never
have
work
the
wickedness
of
which
he
have
just
now
hear
,
but
any
other
Pecksniff
could
;
and
the
Pecksniff
who
could
do
that
could
do
anything
,
and
no
doubt
have
be
do
anything
and
everything
except
the
right
thing
,
all
through
his
career
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
lofty
height
on
which
poor
Tom
have
place
his
idol
it
be
tumble
down
headlong
,
and
     
not
all
the
king
's
horse
,
nor
all
the
king
's
man
,
     
Could
have
set
Mr
Pecksniff
up
again
.
   
<EOS>
legion
of
Titans
could
not
have
get
him
out
of
the
mud
;
and
serve
him
right
!
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
he
who
suffer
;
it
be
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
His
compass
be
break
,
his
chart
destroy
,
his
chronometer
have
stop
,
his
mast
be
go
by
the
board
;
his
anchor
be
adrift
,
ten
thousand
league
away
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
watch
him
with
a
lively
interest
,
for
he
divine
the
purpose
of
Tom
's
rumination
,
and
be
curious
to
see
how
he
conduct
himself
.
 
<EOS>
for
some
time
,
Tom
wander
up
and
down
the
aisle
like
a
man
demente
,
stop
occasionally
to
lean
against
a
pew
and
think
it
over
;
then
he
stand
stare
at
a
blank
old
monument
border
tastefully
with
skull
and
cros
-
bone
,
as
if
it
be
the
fine
work
of
Art
he
have
ever
see
,
although
at
other
time
he
hold
it
in
unspeakable
contempt
;
then
he
sit
down
;
then
walk
to
and
fro
again
;
then
go
wander
up
into
the
organ
-
loft
,
and
touch
the
key
.
 
<EOS>
but
their
minstrelsy
be
change
,
their
music
go
;
and
sound
one
long
melancholy
chord
<EOS>
,
Tom
droop
his
head
upon
his
hand
and
give
it
up
as
hopeless
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
have
care
,
"
say
Tom
Pinch
,
rise
from
his
stool
and
look
down
into
the
church
as
if
he
have
be
the
Clergyman
,
"
I
would
not
have
care
for
anything
he
may
have
do
to
Me
,
for
I
have
try
his
patience
often
,
and
have
live
upon
his
sufferance
and
have
never
be
the
help
to
him
that
other
could
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
minded
,
Pecksniff
,
"
Tom
continued
,
little
thinking
who
hear
him
,
"
if
you
have
do
Me
any
wrong
;
I
could
have
find
plenty
of
excuse
for
that
;
and
though
you
may
have
hurt
me
,
could
have
still
go
on
respect
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
why
do
you
ever
fall
so
low
as
this
in
my
esteem
!
 
<EOS>
oh
Pecksniff
,
Pecksniff
<EOS>
,
there
be
nothing
I
would
not
have
give
,
to
have
have
you
deserve
my
old
opinion
of
you
;
nothing
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
sit
upon
the
hassock
pull
up
his
shirt
-
collar
,
while
Tom
,
touch
to
the
quick
,
deliver
this
apostrophe
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
pause
he
hear
Tom
come
down
the
stair
,
jingle
the
church
key
;
and
bring
his
eye
to
the
top
of
the
pew
again
,
see
him
go
slowly
out
and
lock
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
durst
not
issue
from
his
place
of
concealment
;
for
through
the
window
of
the
church
he
see
Tom
pass
on
among
the
grave
,
and
sometimes
stop
at
a
stone
,
and
lean
there
as
if
he
be
a
mourner
who
have
lose
a
friend
.
 
<EOS>
even
when
he
have
leave
the
churchyard
,
Mr
Pecksniff
still
remain
shut
up
;
not
be
at
all
secure
but
that
in
his
restless
state
of
mind
Tom
may
come
wander
back
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
he
issue
forth
,
and
walk
with
a
pleasant
countenance
into
the
vestry
;
where
he
know
there
be
a
window
near
the
ground
,
by
which
he
could
release
himself
by
merely
step
out
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
in
a
curious
frame
of
mind
,
Mr
Pecksniff
;
be
in
no
hurry
to
go
,
but
rather
incline
to
a
dilatory
trifling
with
the
time
,
which
prompt
him
to
open
the
vestry
cupboard
,
and
look
at
himself
in
the
parson
's
little
glass
that
hang
within
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
see
that
his
hair
be
rumpled
,
he
take
the
liberty
of
borrow
the
canonical
brush
and
arrange
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
also
take
the
liberty
of
open
another
cupboard
;
but
he
shut
it
up
again
quickly
,
be
rather
startle
by
the
sight
of
a
black
and
a
white
surplice
dangle
against
the
wall
;
which
have
very
much
the
appearance
of
two
curate
who
have
commit
suicide
by
hang
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
remember
that
he
have
see
in
the
first
cupboard
a
port
-
wine
bottle
and
some
biscuit
,
he
peep
into
it
again
,
and
help
himself
with
much
deliberation
;
cogitate
all
the
time
though
,
in
a
very
deep
and
weighty
manner
,
as
if
his
thought
be
otherwise
employ
.
   
<EOS>
He
soon
make
up
his
mind
,
if
it
have
ever
be
in
doubt
;
and
put
back
the
bottle
and
biscuit
,
open
the
casement
.
 
<EOS>
He
get
out
into
the
churchyard
without
any
difficulty
;
shut
the
window
after
him
;
and
walk
straight
home
.
   
<EOS>

<EOS>
He
see
that
Mr

reckon
on

because
his

so

explain
would
incense
the

full
amend
to
Tom
for
any
other
joke

<EOS>
under
less
uncommon
circumstance
,
it
would
have
cut
Tom
to
the
heart
to
leave
these
thing
and
think
that
he
see
them
for
the
last
time
;
but
it
do
not
now
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
Pecksniff
;
there
never
have
be
a
Pecksniff
;
and
all
his
other
griefs
be
swallow
up
in
that
.
   
<EOS>
so
,
when
he
return
into
the
bedroom
,
and
,
have
fasten
his
box
and
a
carpet
-
bag
,
put
on
his
walk
gaiter
,
and
his
great

coat
,
and
his
hat
,
and
take
his
stick
in
his
hand
,
look
round
it
for
the
last
time
.
 
<EOS>
early
on
summer
morning
,
and
by
the
light
of
private
candle
-
end
on
winter
night
,
he
have
read
himself
half
blind
in
this
same
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
try
in
this
same
room
to
learn
the
fiddle
under
the
bedclothe
,
but
yield
to
objection
from
the
other
pupil
,
have
reluctantly
abandon
the
design
.
 
<EOS>
at
any
other
time
he
would
have
part
from
it
with
a
pang
,
think
of
all
he
have
learn
there
,
of
the
many
hour
he
have
pass
there
;
for
the
love
of
his
very
dream
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
Pecksniff
;
there
never
have
be
a
Pecksniff
,
and
the
unreality
of
Pecksniff
extend
itself
to
the
chamber
,
in
which
,
sit
on
one
particular
bed
,
the
thing
suppose
to
be
that
Great
Abstraction

often
preach
morality
with
such
effect
that
Tom
have
feel
a
moisture
in
his
eye
,
while
hang
breathless
on
the
word

<EOS>
the
man
engage
to
bear
his
box

Tom

him
well
:
a
Dragon
man
---
 
come
stamp
up
the
stair
,
and
make
a
roughish
bow
to
Tom
(
to
whom
in
common
time
he
would
have
nod
with
a
grin
)
as
though
he
be
aware
of
what
have
happen
,
and
wish
him
to
perceive
it
make
no
difference
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
clumsily
do
;
he
be
a
mere
waterer
of
horse
;
but
Tom
like
the
man
for
it
,
and
feel
it
more
than
go
away
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
would
have
help
him
with
the
box
,
but
he
make
no
more
of
it
,
though
it
be
a
heavy
one
,
than
an
elephant
would
have
make
of
a
castle
;
just
swinge
it
on
his
back
and
bowl
downstairs
as
if
,
be
naturally
a
heavy
sort
of
fellow
,
he
could
carry
a
box
infinitely
better
than
he
could
go
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Tom

with
him

<EOS>
on
which
,
the
good
of
Tom

if

dreadfully

<EOS>
Tom

He

inside

set
artfully
between
two
little
window
that
look
up

so
that
when

mind
the
child

<EOS>
astonishment
make

he
prefer
the
latter

and
send
her
into
the
toll

house
with
a
flea
in

<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
so
should

"
   
<EOS>
if
a
heavy
drove
of
oxen
have
not
come
by
immediately
,
the
tollman
would
have
go
down
to
the
village
straight
,
to
inquire
into

<EOS>
as
thing
turn
out
,
he
smoke
another
pipe
,

take
his

but
their
united
sagacity
could
make
nothing
of
it
,
and
they
go
to
bed
---
metaphorically
---
in
the
dark
.
 
<EOS>
but
several
time
that
night
,
when
a
waggon
or
other
vehicle
come
through
,
and
the
driver
ask
the
tollkeeper
<EOS>
"
what
news
?
<EOS>
"
he
look
at
the
man
by
the
light
of
his
lantern
,
to
assure
himself
that
he
have
an
interest
in
the
subject
,
and
then
say
,
wrap
his
watch

coat
round
his
leg
:

"
You
have
heerd
of
Mr

<EOS>
"

They

after

plunge
into
his

again
,

while
the

side
go
on

do
his
good
to
get
there
.
 
<EOS>
the
evening
be
beautiful
at
first
,
but
it
become
cloudy
and
dull
at
sunset
,
and
the
rain
fall
heavily
soon
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
for
ten
long
mile
he
plod
on
,
wet
through

until
at
last
the

he
come
into
the

He
go
to
the
inn
where
he
have
wait

and
briefly
answer
their
inquiry
after
Mr

<EOS>
He
have
no
heart
for
tea
or
supper
,
meat

but
sit
by
himself
before
an
empty
table
in
the
public
room
while
the

be
get
ready
,
revolve
in
his
mind
all
that
have
happen
that
eventful
day
,
and
wonder
what
he
could

should
do
for
the
future
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
relief
when
the
chambermaid
come
in

and
say
the
bed
be
ready

<EOS>
It
be
a
low
four

shelve
downward

variety
of
queer

the

for
such
a
long
space
of
time
that
it
plead
immemorial
usage
,
and
would
not

open
now

<EOS>
these
be
trifle
in
themselves
,
but
they
add
to
the
strangeness
of
the
place
,
and
do
not
induce
Tom
to
forget
his
new
position

<EOS>
Pecksniff
have
go
out
of
the
world

as
much
as

My

over
his
pie
at
dinner
,
with
his
spoon
a
perfect
fixture
in
his
mouth

look
at
your

I
have
see
him
stand
in
a
corner
of
our
drawing

room
,
gaze
at
her
,
in
such
a
lonely
,
melancholy
state

have
draw
tear

take
leave

I
do
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
the
violence
of
that
young
man
,
my
dear
Miss
Pecksniff
;
the
frightful
opinion
he
express
upon
the
subject
of
self
-
destruction
;
the
extraordinary
action
he
perform
with
his
tea
;
the
clench
way
in
which
he
bite
his
bread
and
butter
;
the
manner
in
which
he
taunt
Mr
Jinkins
;
all
combine
to
form
a
picture
never

It
be
a

Miss

supreme
indifference

"
and
now

Mrs

,
"
now
he

the
meek
of
man

<EOS>
You
can
almost
bring
the
tear
into
his
eye

look
at
him

He
sit
with
me
the
whole
day
long

be
beyond

performance

here

no

can
imagine

I

it
be
him

that
he

do
it
at

"
   
<EOS>
the
contempt
with
which
Miss
Charity
receive
this
pathetic
account
of
the
state
to
which
the
young
gentleman
in
company
be
reduce
,
do
not
say
much
for
her
power
of
sympathise
with
that
unfortunate
character
.
 
<EOS>
She
treat
it
with
great
levity
,
and
go
on
to
inform
herself
,
then
and
afterwards
,
whether
any
other
change
have
occur
in
the
commercial
boarding

house

Mr
Bailey
be
go
,
and
have
be
succeed
(
such
be
the
decay
of
human
greatness
!
)
<EOS>
by
an
old
woman
whose
name
be
report
to
be
Tamaroo
---
which
seem
an
impossibility
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
it
appear
in
the
fullness
of
time
that
the
jocular
boarder
have
appropriate
the
word
from
an
english
ballad
,
in
which
it
be
suppose
to
express
the
bold
and
fiery
nature
of
a
certain
hackney
coachman
;
and
that
it
be
bestow
upon
Mr
Bailey
's
successor
by
reason
of
her
have
nothing
fiery
about
her
,
except
an
occasional
attack
of
that
fire
which
be
call
St.
Anthony
's
.
 
<EOS>
this
ancient
female
have
be
engage
,
in
fulfillment
of
a
vow
,
register
by
Mrs
Todgers
,
that
no
more
boy
should
darken
the
commercial
door
;
and
she
be
chiefly
remarkable
for
a
total
absence
of
all
comprehension
upon
every
subject
<EOS>
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
perfect
Tomb
for
message
and
small
parcel
;
and
when
dispatch
to
the
Post
Office
with
letter
,
have
be
frequently
see
endeavour
to
insinuate
them
into
casual
chink
in
private
door
,
under
the
delusion
that
any
door
with
a
hole
in
it
would
answer
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
very
little
old
woman
,
and
always
wear
a
very
coarse
apron
with
a
bib
before
and
a
loop
behind
,
together
with
bandage
on
her
wrist
,
which
appear
to
be
afflict
with
an
everlasting
sprain
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
on
all
occasion
chary
of
open
the
street
door
,
and
ardent
to
shut
it
again
;
and
she
wait
at
table
in
a
bonnet
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
the
only
great
change
over
and
above
the
change
which
have
fall
on
the
young
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
him
,
he
more
than
corroborate
the
account
of
Mrs
Todgers
;
possess
great
sensibility
than
even
she
have
give
him
credit
for
.
 
<EOS>
He
entertain
some
terrible
notion
of
Destiny
,
among
other
matter
,
and
talk
much
about
people
's
"
mission
"
;
upon
which
he
seem
to
have
some
private
information
not
generally
attainable
,
as
he
know
it
have
be
poor
Merry
's
mission
to
crush
him
in
the
bud
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
frail
and
tearful
;
for
be
aware
that
a
shepherd
's
mission
be
to
pipe
to
his
flock
,
and
that
a
boatswain
's
mission
be
to
pipe
all
hand
,
and
that
one
man
's
mission
be
to
be
a
pay
piper
,
and
another
man
's
mission
be
to
pay
the
piper
,
so
he
have
get
it
into
his
head
that
his
own
peculiar
mission
be
to
pipe
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
which
he
do
perpetually
.
   
<EOS>
He
often
inform
Mrs
Todgers
that
the
sun
have
set
upon
him
;
that
the
billow
have
roll
over
him
;
that
the
car
of
Juggernaut
have
crush
him
,
and
also
that
the
deadly
Upas
tree
of
Java
have
blight
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
name
be
Moddle

this
most
unhappy
Moddle

Miss

at
first
with
distant
haughtiness

be
in
no

<EOS>
the

this
,

a
short
time

Mrs

and
come
to

by
degree

that
be
my
advice

"
   
<EOS>

I
can

<EOS>
I
have

Her

Her

in
general

the
young

but
particularly
her
nose

It
be
so

it

"
   
<EOS>
the
observant
matron
do
not
fail
to
report
this
conversation
to
Charity
,
who
laugh
at
the
time
,
but
treat
Mr
Moddle
that
very
evening
with
increase
consideration
,
and
present
her
side
face
to
him
as
much
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Moddle
be
not
less
sentimental
than
usual
;
be
rather
more
so
,
if
anything
;
but
he
sit
and
stare
at
her
with
glisten
eye
,
and
seem
grateful
.
   
<EOS>
"
well

I

"
when

<EOS>
this
be
likewise
carry
to
Charity
,
who
talk
and
smile
next
evening
in
her
most
engaging
manner
,
and
rally
Mr
Moddle
on
the
lowness
of
his
spirit
,
challenge
him
to
play
a
rubber
at
cribbage
.
<EOS>
Mr
Moddle
take
up
the
gauntlet
,
they
play
several
rubber
for
sixpence
,
and
Charity
win
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
this
may
have
be
partially
attributable
to
the
gallantry
of
the
young
gentleman
,
but
it
be
certainly
referable
to
the
state
of
his
feeling
also
;
for
his
eye
be
frequently
dim
by
tear
<EOS>
,
he
think
that
ace
be
ten
,
and
knave
queens
,
which
at
time
occasion
some
confusion
in
his
play
.
   
<EOS>
on
the
seventh
night
of
cribbage
,
when
Mrs
Todgers
,
sit
by
,
propose
that
instead
of
gamble
they
should
play
for
"
love
,
"
Mr
Moddle
be
see
to
change
colour
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
fourteenth
night
,
he
kiss
Miss
Pecksniff
's
snuffer
,
in
the
passage
,
when
she
go
upstairs
to
bed
;
mean
to
have
kiss
her
hand
,
but
miss
it
.
   
<EOS>
in
short
,
Mr
Moddle
begin
to
be
impress
with
the
idea
that
Miss
Pecksniff
's
mission
be
to
comfort
him
;
and
Miss
Pecksniff
begin
to
speculate
on
the
probability
of
its
be
her
mission
to
become
ultimately
Mrs
Moddle
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
young
gentleman
(
Miss
Pecksniff
be
not
a
very
young
lady
)
with
rise
prospect
,
and
"
almost
"
enough
to
live
on
.
 
<EOS>
really
it
look
very
well
.
   
<EOS>
besides
---
besides
---
he
have
be
regard
as
devoted
to
Merry
.
 
<EOS>
Merry
have
joke
about
him
,
and
have
once
speak
of
it
to
her
sister
as
a
conquest
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
better
look
,
better
shape
,
better
speak
,
better
temper
,
better
mannere
than
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
easy
to
manage
,
could
be
make
to
consult
the
humour
of
his
betroth
,
and
could
be
show
off
like
a
lamb
when
Jonas
be
a
bear
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
rub
!
   
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
the
cribbage
go
on
,
and
Mrs
Todgers
go
off
;
for
the
young
gentleman
,
drop
her
society
,
begin
to
take
Miss
Pecksniff
to
the
play
.
 
<EOS>
He
also
begin
,
as
Mrs
Todgers
say
,
to
slip
home
"
in
his
dinner
-
time
,
"
and
to
get
away
from
"
the
office
"
at
unholy
season
;
and
twice
,
as
he
inform
Mrs
Todgers
himself
,
he
receive
anonymous
letter
,
enclose
card
from
Furniture
Warehouses
---
clearly
the
act
of
that
ungentlemanly
ruffian
Jinkins
;
only
he
have
not
evidence
enough
to
call
him
out
upon
.
 
<EOS>
all
of
which
,
so
Mrs
Todgers
tell
Miss
Pecksniff
,
speak
as
plain
English
as
the
shine
sun
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My

Miss
Pecksniff

They
baulk
themselves
continually

I

for
month

month

before
he

<EOS>
Miss
Pecksniff
submit
that
todger
may
not
have
be
a
fair

<EOS>
"

Mrs

<EOS>
"
no

<EOS>
You
give
Mr
Moddle
a
little
encouragement

Miss

if
you
wish
him
to
speak
;

he
will
speak
fast
enough

depend
upon
it

<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
do
not
know
what
encouragement
he
would
have

Mrs
Todgers

"
return
Charity
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
walk
with
me
,
and
play
card
with

he
come
and

alone
with

I
should
think
so

say
Mrs

and
then
he
begin
to
cry
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Todgers
admit
that
he
may
do
better
than
that
;
and
may
undoubtedly
profit
by
the
recollection
of
the
great
Lord
Nelson
's

"
I
use
to

sometimes
,
"
say
Mr

"
as

,
there

He
see
it

sit

and
improve
the
circle
,
without
make
any
attempt

be
strong
enough
to
move
about
with

even
then
his

for

He
be

floor
indeed

and
by

heavy

!
 
<EOS>
as
any

<EOS>
but
Martin
may
have
know
beforehand

<EOS>
if
Mark

friend
have
be
kind
to
Martin
<EOS>
(
and
they
have
be
very
)
,
they
be
twenty
time
kind
to
Mark

<EOS>
and
now
it
be
Martin
's
turn
to
work
,
and
sit
beside
the
bed
and
watch
,
and
listen
through
the
long
,
long
night
,
to
every
sound
in
the
gloomy
wilderness
;
and
hear
poor
Mr
Tapley
,
in
his
wander
fancy
,
play
at
skittle
in
the
Dragon
,
make
love
-
remonstrance
to
Mrs

get
his

leg
on

the

travel

Tom
Pinch
on

road

and
burn
stump

all
at
once

but
whenever
Martin
give
him
drink
or
medicine
,
or
tend
him
in
any
way
,
or
come
into
the
house
return
from
some
drudgery
without
,
the
patient
Mr
Tapley
brighten
up
and
cry
:
"
I
be
jolly
,
sir
;
"
I
be
jolly
!
"
   
<EOS>
now
,
when
Martin
begin
to
think
of
this
,
and
to
look
at
Mark
as
he
lie
there
;
never
reproach
him
by
so
much
as
an
expression
of
regret
;
never
murmur
;
always
strive
to
be
manful
and
staunch
;
he
begin
to
think
,
how
be
it
that
this
man
who
have
have
so
few
advantage
,
be
so
much
well
than
he
who
have
have
so
many
?
 
<EOS>
and
attendance
upon
a
sick
bed
,
but
especially
the
sick
bed
of
one
whom
we
have
be
accustom
to
see
in
full
activity
and
vigour
,
<EOS>
be
a
great
breeder
of
reflection
,
he
begin
to
ask
himself
in
what
they
differ
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
assist
in
come
to
a
conclusion
on
this
head
by
the
frequent
presence
of
Mark
's
friend
,
their
fellow
-
passenger
across
the
ocean
,
which
suggest
to
him
that
in
regard
to
have
aid
her
,
for
example
,
they
have
differ
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
somehow
he
couple
Tom
Pinch
with
this
train
of
reflection
;
and
think
that
Tom
would
be
very
likely
to
have
strike
up
the
same
sort
of
acquaintance
under
similar
circumstance
,
begin
to
think
in
what
respect
two
people
so
extremely
different
be
like
each
other
,
and
be
unlike
him
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
sight
there
be
nothing
very
distressing
in
these
meditation
,
but
they
do
undoubtedly
distress
him
for
all
that
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
's
nature
be
a
frank
and
generous
one
;
but
he
have
be
breed
up
in
his
grandfather
's
house
;
and
it
will
usually
be
find
that
the
mean
domestic
vice
propagate
themselves
to
be
their
own
antagonist
.
 
<EOS>
Selfishness
do
this
especially
;
so
do
suspicion
,
cunning
,
stealth
,
and
covetous
propensity
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
have
unconsciously
reason
as
a
child
,
"
My
guardian
take
so
much
thought
of
himself
,
that
unless
I
do
the
like
by
myself
,
I
shall
be
forget
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
so
he
have
grow
selfish
.
   
<EOS>
but
he
have
never
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
if
any
one
have
tax
him
with
the
vice
,
he
would
have
indignantly
repel
the
accusation
,
and
conceive
himself
unworthily
asperse
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
would
have
know
it
,
but
that
be
newly
rise
from
a
bed
of
dangerous
sickness
,
to
watch
by
such
another
couch
,
he
feel
how
nearly
Self
have
drop
into
the
grave
,
and
what
a
poor
dependent
,
miserable
thing
it
be
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
natural
for
him
to
reflect
---
he
have
month
to
do
it
in
---
upon
his
own
escape
,
and
Mark
's
extremity
.
 
<EOS>
this
lead
him
to
consider
which
of
them
could
be
the
better
spare
,
and
why
?
 
<EOS>
then
the
curtain
slowly
rise
a
very
little
way
;
and
Self
,
Self
,
Self
,
be
show
below
.
   
<EOS>
He
ask
himself
,
besides
,
when
dread
Mark
's
decease
(
as
all
man
do
and
must
,
at
such
a
time
)
,
whether
he
have
do
his
duty
by
him
,
and
have
deserve
and
make
a
good
response
to
his
fidelity
and
zeal
.
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
short
as
their
companionship
have
be
,
he
feel
in
many
,
many
instance
,
that
there
be
blame
against
himself
;
and
still
inquire
why
,
the
curtain
slowly
rise
a
little
more
,
and
Self
,
Self
,
Self
,
dilate
on
the
scene
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
long
before
he
fix
the
knowledge
of
himself
so
firmly
in
his
mind
that
he
could
thoroughly
discern
the
truth
;
but
in
the
hideous
solitude
of
that
most
hideous
place
,
with
Hope
so
far
remove
,
Ambition
quench
,
and
death
beside
him
rattle
at
the
very
door
,
reflection
come
,
as
in
a
plague
-
beleaguered
town
;
and
so
he
feel
and
know
the
failing
of
his
life
,
and
see
distinctly
what
an
ugly
spot
it
be
.
   
<EOS>
Eden
be
a
hard
school
to
learn
so
hard
a
lesson
in
;
but
there
be
teacher
in
the
swamp
and
thicket
,
and
the
pestilential
air
,
who
have
a
search
method
of
their
own
.
   
<EOS>
He
make
a
solemn
resolution
that
when
his
strength
return
he
would
not
dispute
the
point
or
resist
the
conviction
,
but
would
look
upon
it
as
an
establish
fact
,
that
selfishness
be
in
his
breast
,
and
must
be
root
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
so
doubtful
(
and
with
justice
)
of
his
own
character
,
that
he
determine
not
to
say
one
word
of
vain
regret
or
good
resolve
to
Mark
,
but
steadily
to
keep
his
purpose
before
his
own
eye
solely
;
and
there
be
not
a
jot
of
pride
in
this
;
nothing
but
humility
and
steadfastness
;
the
good
armour
he
could
wear
.
 
<EOS>
so
low
have
Eden
bring
him
down
.
 
<EOS>
so
high
have
Eden
raise
him
up
.
   
<EOS>
after
a
long
and
linger
illness
(
in
certain
forlorn
stage
of
which
,
when
too
far
go
to
speak
,
he
have
feebly
write
"
jolly

<EOS>
on
a

,
Mark
show
some
symptom
of
return
health
.
 
<EOS>
They
come
and
go
,
and
flicker
for
a
time
;
but
he
begin
to
mend
at
last
decidedly
;
and
after
that
continue
to
improve
from
day
to
day
.
   
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
be
well
enough
to
talk
without
fatigue
,
Martin
consult
him
upon
a
project
he
have
in
his
mind
,
and
which
a
few
month
back
he
would
have
carry
into
execution
without
trouble
anybody

his
own

<EOS>
"
Ours
be
a
desperate

say
Martin

plainly

<EOS>
the

the

hope

us

the
only
one
end
for
which
we

now
to

to
quit

Mr

significant
stress
upon

<EOS>
"
now
,
upon

we
have

one

can

that

Mr
Bevan

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
of
him
when

"

for

even
write

my

Martin
go
on
to

,

implore
him
for
money
to
free
us
from
this
trap
into
which
we
be
so
cruelly
decoy

Shall
I
try
Mr
Bevan
first
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
very
pleasant
sort
of
a
gentleman
,
"
say
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
the
few
good
we
bring
here
,
and
in
which
we
spend
our
money

would
produce
something
if
sell

resume
Martin
;
"
and
whatever
they
realise
shall
be
pay
him
instantly

they
can
not

sell
here

<EOS>
"
there

Mr

shake
his
head
with
a
rueful
air
,

and
pig
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
tell
him
so
,

only
ask
him
for
money
enough

reach
New

explain
to
him
at

time
how
I
be
connect
,

that
I
will
endeavour
to
repay
him
,
even
through
my

immediately
on

arrival
in
England

"
   
<EOS>
"
why
to
be
sure
,
"
say
Mark
:
"
<EOS>
he
can
only
say
no
,
and
he
may
say
yes

if
you
do
not

try
him

exclaim
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
to
blame
for
come
here
,
and
I
would
do
anything
to
get
away

<EOS>
I
grieve
to
think
of
the
past
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
take
your
opinion
sooner
,
Mark
,
we
never
should
have
be
here
,
I
be
certain
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tapley
be
very
much
surprised
at
this
admission
,
but
protest
,
with
great
vehemence
,
that
they
would
have
be
there
all
the
same
;
and
that
he
have
set
his
heart
upon
come
to
Eden
,
from
the
first
word
he
have
ever
hear
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
then
read
him
a
letter
to
Mr
Bevan
,
which
he
have
already
prepare
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
frankly
and
ingenuously
write
,
and
describe
their
situation
without
the
least
concealment
;
plainly
state
the
misery
they
have
undergo
;
and
prefer
their
request
in
modest
but
straightforward
term
.
 
<EOS>
Mark
highly
commend
it
;
and
they
determine
to
dispatch
it
by
the
next
steamboat
go
the
right
way
,
that
may
call
to
take
in
wood
at
Eden
---
where
there
be
plenty
of
wood
to
spare
.
 
<EOS>
not
know
how
to
address
Mr
Bevan
at
his
own
place
of
abode
,
Martin
superscribe
it
to
the
care
of
the
memorable
Mr
Norris
of
New
York
,
and
write
upon
the
cover
an
entreaty
that
it
may
be
forward
without
delay
.
   
<EOS>
More
than
a
week
elapse
before
a
boat
appear
;
but
at
length
they
be
awaken
very
early
one
morning
by
the
high
-
pressure
snorting
of
the
"
Esau
Slodge
;
"
name
after
one
of
the
most
remarkable
man
in
the
country
,
who
have
be
very
eminent
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
hurry
down
to
the
landing
-
place
,
they
get
it
safe
on
board
;
and
wait
anxiously
to
see
the
boat
depart
,
stop
up
the
gangway
;
an
instance
of
neglect
which
cause
the
"
Capting
"
of
the
Esau
Slodge
to
"
wish
he
may
be
sift
fine
as
flour
,
and
whittle
small
as
chip
;
that
if
they
do
not
come
off
<EOS>
that
there
fix
right
smart
too
,
he
would
spill
'em
in
the
drink
;
"
whereby
the
Capting
metaphorically
say
he
would
throw
them
in
the
river
.
   
<EOS>
They
be
not
likely
to
receive
an
answer
for
eight
or
ten
week
at
the
early
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
they
devote
such
strength
as
they
have
to
the
attempt
improvement
of
their
land
;
to
clear
some
of
it
,
and
prepare
it
for
useful
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
monstrously
defective
<EOS>
as
their
farming
be
,
still
it
be
well
than
their
neighbour
'
;
for
Mark
have
some
practical
knowledge
of
such
matter
,
and
Martin
learn
of
him
;
whereas
the
other
settler
who
remain
upon
the
putrid
swamp
(
a
mere
handful
,
and
those
wither
by
disease
)
,
appear
to
have
wander
there
with
the
idea
that
husbandry
be
the
natural
gift
of
all
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
They
help
each
other
after
their
own
manner
in
these
struggle
,
and
in
all
other
;
but
they
work
as
hopelessly
and
sadly
as
a
gang
of
convict
in
a
penal
settlement
.
   
<EOS>
often
at
night
when
Mark
and
Martin
be
alone
,
and
lie
down
to
sleep
,
they
speak
of
home
,
familiar
place
,
house
,
road
,
and
people
whom
they
know
;
sometimes
in
the
lively
hope
of
see
them
again
,
and
sometimes
with
a
sorrowful
tranquillity
,
as
if
that
hope
be
dead
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
source
of
great
amazement
to
Mark
Tapley
to
find
,
pervade
all
these
conversation
,
a
singular
alteration
in
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
to
make
of
him
,
"
he
think
one
night
,
"
he
be
not
what
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
think
of
himself
half
as
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
try
him
again
.
 
<EOS>
Asleep

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
Poor

thoughtfully

"
I

more

Martin

<EOS>
"
though
I
do

I

We

perhaps

He

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes

Martin
,
after
a
short
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
,
Mark
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
speak
so
regretfully
that
his
partner
abandon
the
theme
,
and
be
silent
for
a
short
time
until
he
have
think
of
another
.
   
<EOS>
"
ah
,
sir
!
"
say
Mark
,
with
a
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
dear
me

<EOS>
You

venture
a
good
deal

I

sure
of

be
the
reply
;
so
hastily
and
energetically
speak
,
that
Martin
sit
up
in
his
bed
to
give
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
be
far
from

<EOS>
You
may
depend

she
be
very
unhappy

<EOS>
She
have
sacrifice
her
peace
of

she
have
endanger
her

very
much

she
can
not

away
from
those
who
be
jealous
of

oppose
to
her

I
have
do

She
have
to
endure

Mark

endure
without

Mr

wide
in

do
not

all

It
occur
to
Martin
that
if
the

have
stay
at
home

send
his
shoe
upon
a
tour
,
they
would
have
answer

they
be
the
only
part

see
anything

in

of
time

however
,
Mr

rise

have
eject
certain

impede

take
up
a

there
be
something

"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
Martin
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation

I
have
learn

Mr

go
to
make

great
speech
in

next
session
about
foreign
relation

be
go
to
write
strong
article
on
the
subject

and
as
he
greatly
favour
the
free
and
independent
custom
(
a
very
harmless
and
agreeable
one
)
of
procure
information
of
any
sort
in
any
kind
of
confidence
,
and
afterwards
pervert
it
publicly
in
any
manner

happen
to
suit
him

he
have
determine
to
get
at
Martin

opinion
somehow

other

for
if
he
could
have
get
nothing
out
of
him

he
would
have
have
to
invent
it
for
him
,
and
that
would
have
be
laborious
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
a
mental
note

go
in
again

what

pretty
strong
term

a
calm
philosopher
.
 
<EOS>
which
Martin
be
extremely
glad
to
hear
;
for
he
have
begin
to
speculate
on
Elijah
be
a
disciple
of
that
other
school
of
republican
philosophy
,
whose
noble
sentiment
be
carve
with
knife
upon
a
pupil
's
body
,
and
write
,
not
with
pen
and
ink
,
but
tar
and
feather
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think
of
my
countryman
who
be
present
,
sir

<EOS>
inquire
Elijah
Pogram
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
very
pleasant
,
"

Martin

<EOS>
They
be
a
very
pleasant
party
.
 
<EOS>
no
man
have
speak
a
word
;
every
one
have
be
intent
,
as
usual
,
on
his
own
private
gorging
;
and
the
great
part
of
the
company
be
decidedly
dirty
feeder
.
   
<EOS>
the
honourable
Elijah
Pogram
look
at
Martin
as
if
he
think
"
You
do
not
mean
that
,
I
know
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
be
soon
confirm
in
this
opinion
.
   
<EOS>
sit
opposite
to
them
be
a
gentleman
in
a
high
state
of
tobacco
,
who
wear
quite
a
little
beard
,
compose
of
the
overflowing
of
that
weed
,
as
they
have
dry
about
his
mouth
and
chin
<EOS>
;
so
common
an
ornament
that
it
would
scarcely
have
attract
Martin
's
observation
,
but
that
this
good
citizen
,
burn
to
assert
his
equality
against
all
comer
,
suck
his
knife
for
some
moment
,
and
make
a
cut
with
it
at
the
butter
,
just
as
Martin
be
in
the
act
of
take
some
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
juiciness
about
the
deed
that
may
have
sicken
a
scavenger
.
   
<EOS>
when
Elijah
Pogram
(
to
whom
this
be
an
every
-
day
incident
)
see
that
Martin
put
the
plate
away
,
and
take
no
butter
,
he
be
quite
delighted
,
and
say
,
   
"
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
the
morbid
hatred
of
you
british
to
the
institution
of
our
country
be
as

tonishe

<EOS>
"
upon
my
life

cry
Martin
,
in
his
turn
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
the
most
wonderful
community
that
ever
exist

<EOS>
a
man
deliberately
make
a
hog
of
himself

that
be
an
institution

<EOS>
"
We

no

Elijah

"
acquire
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
not
a
question
of
acquire
anything
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
question
of
lose
the
natural
politeness
of
a
savage
,
and
that
instinctive
good
breeding
which
admonish
one
man
not
to
offend
and
disgust
another
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
that
man
over
the
way
,
for
instance
,
naturally
know
better
,
but
consider
it
a
very
fine
and
independent
thing

be
a
brute
in
small
matter

<EOS>

Mr

<EOS>
"
now
,
observe
what
this
come
to
,
Mr
Pogram

"
pursue
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
mass
of
your
countryman
begin
by
stubbornly
neglect
little
social
observance
,
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
gentility
,
custom
,
usage
,
government
,
or
country
,
but
be
act
of
common

decent

natural

human
politeness

<EOS>
You
abet
them
in
this
,
by
resent
all
attack
upon
their
social
offence
as
if
they
be
a
beautiful
national
feature

<EOS>
from
disregard
small
obligation
they
come
in
regular
course
to
disregard
great
one
;

so
refuse
to
pay
their
debt

<EOS>
what
they
may
do
,
or
what
they
may
refuse
to
do
next
,
I
do
not
know
;

any
man
may
see
if
he
will
,
that
it
will
be
something
follow
in
natural
succession
,

a
part
of
one
great
growth
,
which
be
rotten
at
the
root

"
   
<EOS>
the
mind
of
Mr
Pogram
be
too
philosophical
to
see
this
;
so
they
go
on
deck
again
,
<EOS>
where
,
resume
his
former
post
,
he
chew
until
he
be
in
a
lethargic
state

amount
to
insensibility

<EOS>
after
a
weary
voyage
of
several
day
,
they
come
again
to
that

wharf
where
Mark
have
be

nearly
leave

what
he
think

political
question

what
he
think

end

meeting
seem
to
be
,
not

the
corner
on

so
there
they
keep
him

hard

emotion
of
delight

for

<EOS>
Their
first
salutation
be
exchange
in
a
voice
too
low
to
reach
the
impatient
ear
of

they
soon
become
audible
,
for
Mrs

feel
her
position

set
up
expressly
for

little
room

in

nothing

It
be
a

abut
close

so
that

grate
against

scrape
it

deride
him

still
it
be
strangely
change
to
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
in
the
centre
of
the
market
-
place
,
he
miss
a
statue
he
have
set
up
there
as
in
all
other
place
of
his
personal
resort
;
and
it
look
cold
and
bare
without
that
ornament
.
   
<EOS>
the
change
lie
no
deep
than
this
,
for
Tom
be
far
from
be
sage
enough
to
know
,
that
,
have
be
disappoint
in
one
man
,
it
would
have
be
a
strictly
rational
and
eminently
wise
proceeding
to
have
revenge
himself
upon
mankind
in
general
,
by
mistrust
them
one
and
all
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
this
piece
of
justice
,
though
it
be
uphold
by
the
authority
of
diver
profound
poet
and
honourable
man
,
bear
a
near
resemblance
to
the
justice
of
that
good
Vizier
in
the
thousand
-
and
-
one
Nights
,
who
issue
order
for
the
destruction
of
all
the
Porters
in
Bagdad
because
one
of
that
unfortunate
fraternity
be
suppose
to
have
misconduct
himself
,
than
to
any
logical
,
not
to
say
Christian
,
system
of
conduct
,
know
to
the
world
in
later
time
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
have
so
long
be
use
to
steep
the
Pecksniff
of
his
fancy
in
his
tea
,
and
spread
him
out
upon
his
toast
,
and
take
him
as
a
relish
with
his
beer
,
that
he
make
but
a
poor
breakfast
on
the
first
morning
after
his
expulsion
.
 
<EOS>
nor
do
he
much
improve
his
appetite
for
dinner
by
seriously
consider
his
own
affair
,
and
take
counsel
thereon
with
his
friend
the
organist
's
assistant
.
   
<EOS>
the
organist
's
assistant
give
it
as
his
decide
opinion
that
whatever
Tom
do
,
he
must
go
to
London
;
for
there
be
no
place
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
which
may
be
true
in
the
main
,
though
hardly
,
perhaps
,
in
itself
,
a
sufficient
reason
for
Tom
's
go
there
.
   
<EOS>
but
Tom
have
think
of
London
before
,
and
have
couple
with
it
thought
of
his
sister
,
and
of
his
old
friend
John
Westlock
,
whose
advice
he
naturally
feel
disposed
to
seek
in
this
important
crisis
of
his
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
to
London
,
therefore
,
he
resolve
to
go
;
and
he
go
away
to
the
coach
-
office
at
once
,
to
secure
his
place
.
 
<EOS>
the
coach
be
already
full
,
he
be
oblige
to
postpone
his
departure
until
the
next
night
;
but
even
this
circumstance
have
its
bright
side
as
well
as
its
dark
one
,
for
though
it
threaten
to
reduce
his
poor
purse
with
unexpected
country
charge
,
it
afford
him
an
opportunity
of
write
to
Mrs
Lupin
and
appoint
his
box
to
be
bring
to
the
old
finger
-
post
at
the
old
time
;
which
would
enable
him
to
take
that
treasure
with
him
to
the
metropolis
,
and
save
the
expense
of
its
carriage
.
 
<EOS>
"
so
,
"
say
Tom
,
<EOS>
comfort
himself
,
"
it
be
very
nearly
as
broad
as
it
be
long
.
"
   
<EOS>
and
it
can
not
be
deny
that
,
when
he
have
make
up
his
mind
to
even
this
extent
,
he
feel
an
unaccustomed
sense
of
freedom
---
a
vague
and
indistinct
impression
of
holiday
-
make
---
which
be
very
luxurious
.
<EOS>
He
have
his
moment
of
depression
and
anxiety
,
and
they
be
,
with
good
reason
,
pretty
numerous
;
but
still
,
it
be
wonderfully
pleasant
to
reflect
that
he
be
his
own
master
,
and
could
plan
and
scheme
for
himself
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
startling
,
thrilling
,
vast
,
difficult
to
understand
;
it
be
a
stupendous
truth
,
teem
with
responsibility
and
self
-
distrust
;
but
in
spite
of
all
his
care
,
it
give
a
curious
relish
to
the
viand
at
the
Inn
,
and
interpose
a
dreamy
haze
between
him
and
his
prospect
,
in
which
they
sometimes
show
to
magical
advantage
.
   
<EOS>
in
this
unsettled
state
of
mind
,
Tom
go
once
more
to
bed
in
the
low
four
-
poster
,
to
the
same
immovable
surprise
of
the
effigy
of
the
former
landlord
and
the
fat
ox
;
and
in
this
condition
,
pass
the
whole
of
the
succeed
day
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
coach
come
round
at
last
with
"
London
"
blazon
in
letter
of
gold
upon
the
boot
,
it
give
Tom
such
a
turn
,
that
he
be
half
disposed
to
run
away
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
do
it
;
for
he
take
his
seat
upon
the
box
instead
,
and
look
down
upon
the
four
grey
,
feel
as
if
he
be
another
grey
himself
,
or
,
at
all
event
,
a
part
of
the
turn
-
out
;
and
be
quite
confused
by
the
novelty
and
splendour
of
his
situation
.
   
<EOS>
and
really
it
may
have
confuse
a
less
modest
man
than
Tom
to
find
himself
sit
next
that
coachman
;
for
of
all
the
swell
that
ever
flourish
a
whip
professionally
,
he
may
have
be
elect
emperor
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
handle
his
glove
like
another
man
,
but
put
them
on
---
even
when
he
be
stand
on
the
pavement
,
quite
detach
from
the
coach
---
as
if
the
four
grey
be
,
somehow
or
other
,
at
the
end
of
the
finger
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
same
with
his
hat
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
thing
with
his
hat
,
which
nothing
but
an
unlimited
knowledge
of
horse
and
the
wildest
freedom
of
the
road
,
could
ever
have
make
him
perfect
in
.
<EOS>
valuable
little
parcel
be
bring
to
him
with
particular
instruction
,
and
he
pitch
them
into
this
hat
,
and
stick
it
on
again
;
as
if
the
law
of
gravity
do
not
admit
of
such
an
event
as
its
being
knock
off
or
blow
off
,
and
nothing
like
an
accident
could
befall
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
guard
,
too
!
 
<EOS>
seventy
breezy
mile
a
day
be
write
in
his
very
whisker
.
 
<EOS>
His
manner
be
a
canter
;
<EOS>
his
conversation
a
round
trot
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
fast
coach
upon
a
down

hill
turnpike
road
;
he
be
all
pace
.
 
<EOS>
a
waggon
could
not
have
move
slowly
,
with
that
guard
and
his
key
-
bugle
on
the
top
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
these
be
all
foreshadowing
of
London
,
<EOS>
Tom
think
,
as
he
sit
upon
the
box
,
and
look
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
coachman
,
and
such
a
guard
,
never
could
have
exist
between
Salisbury
and
any
other
place
.
 
<EOS>
the
coach
be
none
of
your
steady

go
,
yokel
coach
,
but
a
swaggering
,
rakish

dissipate
London
coach
;
up
all
night
,
and
lie
by
all

and
lead
a
devil
of
a

<EOS>
It

no
more
for
Salisbury

if
it
have
be
a

<EOS>
It
rattle
noisily
through
the
good
street
,
defy
the
Cathedral
,
take
the
bad
corner
sharpest
,
go
cut
in
everywhere
,
make
everything
get
out
of
its
way
;
and
spin
along
the
open
country

road
,
blow
a
lively
defiance
out
of
its
key

bugle
,
as
its
last
glad
parting
legacy

<EOS>
It
be
a
charming
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Mild
and
bright

<EOS>
and
even
with
the
weight
upon
his
mind
which
arise
out
of
the
immensity
and
uncertainty
of
London
,
Tom
could
not
resist
the
captivating
sense
of
rapid
motion
through
the
pleasant
air
.
 
<EOS>
the
four
grey
skim
along
,
as
if
they
like
it
quite
as
well

Tom
do

cheerfully
in

the

a
woman
must
have
arrive
at
maturity

come
provide
with
a
basket

the

there

which
Tom
put
in

<EOS>
the
coachman
be
so
earnest
in
his
approval
of
Mrs
Lupin
's
provident
habit
,
and
congratulate
Torn
so
warmly
on
his
good
fortune
,
that
Tom
feel
it
necessary
,
for
the
lady
's
sake
,
to
explain
that
the
basket
be
a
strictly
platonic
basket
,
and
have
merely
be
present
to
him
in
the
way
of
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
make
the
statement
with
perfect
gravity
;
for
he
feel
it
incumbent
on
him
to
disabuse
the
mind
of
this
lax
rover
of
any
incorrect
impression
on
the
subject
;
he
signify
that
he
would
be
happy
to
share
the
gift
with
him
,
and
propose
that
they
should
attack
the
basket
in
a
spirit
of
good
fellowship
at
any
time
in
the
course
of
the
night
which
the
coachman
's
experience
and
knowledge
of
the
road
may
suggest
,
as
be
best
adapt
to
the
purpose

<EOS>
from
this
time
they
chat
so
pleasantly
together
,
that
although
Tom
know
infinitely
more
of
unicorn
than
horse
,
the
coachman
inform
his
friend
the
guard
at
the
end
of
the
next
stage

"
that
rum

extensive
circle
of
anxious

that
it

Tom

He

asleep

to

great
refreshment
after

and
,
it
be
by
that
time
eight
o'clock
,
go
forth
at
once
to
see
his
old
friend
John
.
   
<EOS>
John
Westlock
live
in
Furnival

High
Holborn

which
be
within
a
quarter
of

walk
of
Tom
's
starting

point
,
but
seem
a
long
way
off
,
by
reason
of
his
go
two
or
three
mile
out
of
the
straight
road
to
make
a
short
cut
.
 
<EOS>
when
at
last
he
arrive
outside
John

door
,
two
story
up
,
he
stand
falter
with
his
hand
upon

knocker

tremble
from
head
to
foot

<EOS>
for
he
be
render
very
nervous
by
the
thought
of
have
to
relate
what
have
fall
out
between
himself
and
Pecksniff
;
and
he
have
a
misgiving
that
John
would
exult
fearfully
in
the
disclosure
.
   
<EOS>
"
but
it
must
be
make

It
do
not

that

nobody
answer

<EOS>
It
be
quite
certain
that
nobody
come

that
Tom

wonder
whereabout
in

,
as
I
often

the

that

here
be

in

It
really
seem

relinquish

John

<EOS>
so
many
year
have
pass
since
Tom
be
last
in
London
,
and
he
have
know
so
little
of
it
then
,
that
his
interest
in
all
he
see
be
very
great
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
particularly
anxious
,
among
other
notorious
locality
,
to
have
those
street
point
out
to
him
which
be
appropriate
to
the
slaughter
of
countryman
;
and
be
quite
disappointed
to
find
,
after
half
-
an
-
hour
's
walking
,
that
he
have
not
have
his
pocket
pick
.
 
<EOS>
but
on
John
Westlock

invent
a
pickpocket
for
his
gratification

and
point
out
a
highly
respectable
stranger
as
one
of

fraternity

be
much
delighted

<EOS>
His
friend
accompany
him
to
within
a
short
distance
of
Camberwell
and
have
put
him
beyond
the
possibility
of

copper

leave
him
to
make
his
visit
.
 
<EOS>
arrive
before
the

reply
the
porter

<EOS>
at
the

time
he
look
at
Tom
from
head
to
foot
,
as
if
he
would
have
say
,
"
You
be
a
nice
man

you
be

where
do
you
come
from

He
have
quite
a
delicacy
in
offer
the
suggestion
,
for
the
possibility
of
such
a
step
do
not
appear
to
present
itself
to
the
porter
's
mind
at
all

<EOS>
the
fact
be
that
the
porter
in
answer
the
gate

bell
have
,
accord
to
usage
,
ring
the
house

bell
(
for
it
be
as
well
to
do
these
thing
in
the
baronial
style
while
you
be
about
it

,
and
that
there
the
function
of
his
office
have
cease

<EOS>
be
hire
to
open

shut
the
gate
,
and
not
to
explain
himself
to
stranger

he
leave
this
little
incident
to
be
develop
by
the

who
,
at
this
juncture
,
call
out
from
the

him

<EOS>
"
She
be
in

reply
the
footman
.
 
<EOS>
as
much
as
to
say
to
Tom
:
"
but
if
you
think

anything

proprietorship

you
have
better
abandon

I

to
have
his

that
moment
by
the
flight
of
a
pigeon

in
which
he
take
so
warm
an
interest
that
his
gaze
be
rivette
on
the
bird
until
it
be
quite
out

He
then
invite

him
into

say
the
young
man

pause
languidly
at
the
door

<EOS>
It
be
a
good
thought

because
without
provide
the
stranger

in
case
he
should
happen
to
be
of
a
warm
temper
,
<EOS>
with
a
sufficient
excuse

knock
him
down

it
imply
this
young

estimate
of
his
quality

and
relieve
his
breast
of
the
oppressive
burden

long
before

until
now

shut

His
cogitation
be
interrupt
by
the
sound

voice
in
the
adjoining
room

They
seem
to
be
engage
in
high
dispute
,

in
indignant
reprimand
of
some
offender
;
and
gather
strength
occasionally
,
break
out
into
a
perfect
whirlwind

It
be
in
one
of
these
gust

as
it
appear
to
Tom

that
the
footman
announce
him
;
for
an
abrupt
and
unnatural
calm
take
place

and
then
a
dead
silence

<EOS>
He
be
stand
before
the
window

wonder
what
domestic

may
have
cause

be
bankrupt
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
more
to
say
,
"
say
Tom
,
much
flush
and
fluster
,
now
that
it
be
over
,
"
except
to
crave
permission
to
stand
in
your
garden
until
my
sister
be
ready
.
"
   
<EOS>
not
wait
to
obtain
it
,
Tom
walk
out
.
   
<EOS>
before
he
have
well
begin
to
cool
,
his
sister
join
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
cry
;
and
Tom
could
not
bear
that
any
one
about
the
house
should
see
her
do
that
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
will
think
you
be
sorry
to
go
,
"
say
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
sorry
to
go
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
Tom
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
anxious
to
go
for
a
very
long
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
very
well
,
then
!
 
<EOS>
do
not
cry
!
"
say
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
sorry
for
you
,
dear
,
"
sob
Tom
's
sister
.
   
<EOS>
"
but
you
ought
to
be
glad
on
my
account
,
"
say
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
twice
as
happy
with
you
for
a
companion
.
 
<EOS>
hold
up
your
head
.
 
<EOS>
there
!
<EOS>
now
we
go
out
as
we
ought
.
 
<EOS>
not
bluster
,
you
know
,
but
firm
and
confident
in
ourselves
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
idea
of
Tom
and
his
sister
blustering
,
under
any
circumstance
,
be
a
splendid
absurdity
.
 
<EOS>
but
Tom
be
very
far
from
feel
it
to
be
<EOS>
so
,
in
his
excitement
;
and
pass
out
at
the
gate
with
such
severe
determination
write
in
his
face
that
the
porter
hardly
know
him
again
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
they
have
walk
some
short
distance
,
and
Tom
find
himself
get
cool
and
more
collected
,
that
he
be
quite
restore
to
himself
by
an
inquiry
from
his
sister
,
who
say
in
her
pleasant
little
voice
:
   
<EOS>
"
where
be
we
go
,
Tom
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
dear
me
!
<EOS>
"
say
Tom
,
stop
,
"
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
do
not
you
---
do
not
you
live
anywhere
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
ask
Tom
's
sister
look
wistfully
in
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
not
exactly
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
arrive
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
have
some
lodging
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
do
not
tell
her
that
he
have
be
go
to
stay
with
his
friend
John
,
and
could
on
no
account
think
of
billet
two
inmate
upon
him
,
of
whom
one
be
a
young
lady
;
for
he
know
that
would
make
her
uncomfortable
,
and
would
cause
her
to
regard
herself
as
be
an
inconvenience
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
neither
do
he
like
to
leave
her
anywhere
while
he
call
on
John
,
and
tell
him
of
this
change
in
his
arrangement
;
for
he
be
delicate
of
seem
to
encroach
upon
the
generous
and
hospitable
nature
of
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
he
say
again
,
"
We
must
have
some
lodging
,
of
course
;
"
and
say
it
as
stoutly
as
if
he
have
be
a
perfect
Directory
and
Guide
-
Book
to
all
the
lodging
in
London
.
   
<EOS>
"
where
shall
we
go
and
look
for
'
em
?
"
say
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think
?
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
's
sister
be
not
much
wise
on
such
a
topic
than
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
squeeze
her
little
purse
into
his
coat
-
pocket
,
and
fold
the
little
hand
with
which
she
do
so
on
the
other
little
hand
with
which
she
clasp
his
arm
,
say
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
ought
to
be
a
cheap
neighbourhood
,
"
say
Tom
,
"
and
not
too
far
from
London
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
see
.
 
<EOS>
Should
you
think
Islington
a
good
place
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
it
be
an
excellent
place
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
use
to
be
call
Merry
Islington
,
once
upon
a
time
,
"
say
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
perhaps
it
be
merry
now
;
if
so
,
it
be
all
the
well
.
 
<EOS>
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
not
too
dear
,
"
say
Tom
's
sister
.
   
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
if
it
be
not
too
dear
,
"
assent
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
where
be
Islington
?
 
<EOS>
We
can
not
do
better
than
go
there
,
I
should
think
.
 
<EOS>
let
's
go
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
's
sister
would
have
go
anywhere
with
him
;
so
they
walk
off
,
arm
in
arm
,
as
comfortably
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
,
presently
,
that
Islington
be
not
in
that
neighbourhood
,
Tom
make
inquiry
respect
a
public
conveyance
thither
;
which
they
soon
obtain
.
<EOS>
as
they
ride
along
they
be
very
full
of
conversation
indeed
,
Tom
relate
what
have
happen
to
him
,
and
<EOS>
Tom
's
sister
relate
what
have
happen
to
her
,
and
both
find
a
great
deal
more
to
say
than
time
to
say
it
in
;
for
they
have
only
just
begin
to
talk
,
in
comparison
with
what
they
have
to
tell
each
other
,
when
they
reach
their
journey
's
end
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
"
say
Tom
,
"
we
must
first
look
out
for
some
very
unpretending
street
,
and
then
look
out
for
bill
in
the
window
.
"
   
<EOS>
so
they
walk
off
again
,
quite
as
happily
as
if
they
have
just
step
out
of
a
snug
little
house
of
their
own
,
to
look
for
lodging
on
account
of
somebody
else
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
's
simplicity
be
unabated
,
Heaven
know
;
but
now
that
he
have
somebody
to
rely
upon
him
,
he
be
stimulate
to
rely
a
little
more
upon
himself
,
and
be
,
in
his
own
opinion
,
quite
a
desperate
fellow
.
   
<EOS>
after
roam
up
and
down
for
hour
,
look
at
some
score
of
lodging
,
they
begin
to
find
it
rather
fatigue
,
especially
as
they
see
none
which
be
at
all
adapt
to
their
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
in
a
singular
little
old
-
fashioned
house
,
up
a
blind
street
,
they
discover
two
small
bedroom
and
a
triangular
parlour
,
which
promise
to
suit
them
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Their
desiring
to
take
possession
immediately
be
a
suspicious
circumstance
,
but
even
this
be
surmount
by
the
payment
of
their
first
week
's
rent
,
and
a
reference
to
John
Westlock
,
Esquire
,
Furnival
's
Inn
,
High
Holborn
.
   
<EOS>
ah
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
goodly
sight
,
when
this
important
point
be
settle
,
to
behold
Tom
and
his
sister
trot
round
to
the
baker
's
,
and
the
butcher
's
,
and
the
grocer
's
,
with
a
kind
of
dreadful
delight
in
the
unaccustomed
care
of
housekeeping
;
take
secret
counsel
together
as
they
give
their
small
order
,
and
distract
by
the
least
suggestion
on
the
part
of
the
shopkeeper
!
 
<EOS>
when
they
get
back
to
the
triangular
parlour
,
and
Tom
's
sister
,
bustle
to
and
fro
,
busy
about
a
thousand
pleasant
nothing
,
stop
every
now
and
then
to
give
old
Tom
a
kiss
or
smile
upon
him
,
<EOS>
Tom
rub
his
hand
as
if
all
Islington
be
his
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
late
in
the
afternoon
now
,
though
,
and
high
time
for
Tom
to
keep
his
appointment
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
after
agree
with
his
sister
that
in
consideration
of
not
have
dine
,
they
would
venture
on
the
extravagance
of
chop
for
supper
at
nine
,
he
walk
out
again
to
narrate
these
marvellous
occurrence
to
John
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
quite
a
family
man
all
at
once
,
"
think
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
I
can
only
get
something
to
do
,
how
comfortable
Ruth
and
<EOS>
I
may
be
!
 
<EOS>
ah
,
that
if
!
<EOS>
but
it
be
of
no
use
to
despond
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
but
do
that
,
when
I
have
try
everything
and
fail
;
and
even
then
it
will
not
serve
me
much
.
 
<EOS>
upon
my
word
,
"
think
Tom
,
quicken
his
pace
,
"
I
do
not
know
what
John
will
think
have
become
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
begin
to
be
afraid
I
have
stray
into
one
of
those
street
where
the
countryman
be
murder
;
and
that
I
have
be
make
meat
pie
of
,
or
some
such
horrible
thing
.

<EOS>
Tom
Pinch
,
go
astray
,
find
that
he
be
not
the
only
person
in
that
predicament
.
 
<EOS>
He
retaliate
upon
a
fall
foe
 
<EOS>
Tom
's
evil
genius
do
not
lead
him
into
the
den
of
any
of
those
preparer
of
cannibalic
pastry
,
who
be
represent
in
many
standard
country
legend
as
do
a
lively
retail
business
in
the
Metropolis
;
nor
do
it
mark
him
out
as
the
prey
of
ring
-
dropper
,
pea
and
thimble
-
rigger
,
duffer
,
touter
,
or
any
of
those
bloodless
sharper
,
who
be
,
perhaps
,
a
little
better
know
to
the
Police
.
 
<EOS>
He
fall
into
conversation
with
no
gentleman
who
take
him
into
a
public
-
house
,
where
there
happen
to
be
another
gentleman
who
swear
he
have
more
money
than
any
gentleman
,
and
very
soon
prove
he
have
more
money
than
one
gentleman
by
take
his
away
from
him
;
neither
do
he
fall
into
any
other
of
the
numerous
man
-
trap
which
be
set
up
without
notice
,
in
the
public
ground
of
this
city
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
lose
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
very
soon
do
that
;
and
in
try
to
find
it
again
he
lose
it
more
and
more
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
Tom
,
in
his
guileless
distrust
of
London
,
think
himself
very
know
in
come
to
the
determination
that
he
would
not
ask
to
be
direct
to
Furnival
's
Inn
,
if
he
could
help
it
;
unless
,
indeed
,
he
should
happen
to
find
himself
near
the
Mint
,
or
the
Bank
of
England
;
in
which
case
he
would
step
in
,
and
ask
a
civil
question
or
two
,
confide
in
the
perfect
respectability
of
the
concern
.
 
<EOS>
so
on
he
go
,
look
up
all
the
street
he
come
near
,
and
go
up
half
of
them
;
and
thus
,
by
dint
of
not
be
true
to
Goswell
Street
,
and
file
off
into
Aldermanbury
,
and
bewilder
himself
in
Barbican
,
and
be
constant
to
the
wrong
point
of
the
compass
in
London
Wall
,
and
then
get
himself
crosswise
into
Thames
Street
,
by
an
instinct
that
would
have
be
marvellous
if
he
have
have
the
least
desire
or
reason
to
go
there
,
he
find
himself
,
at
last
,
hard
by
the
Monument
.
   
<EOS>
the
man
in
the
Monument
be
quite
as
mysterious
a
being
to
Tom
as
the
man
in
the
Moon
.
 
<EOS>
It
immediately
occur
to
him
that
the
lonely
creature
who
hold
himself
aloof
from
all
mankind
in
that
pillar
like
some
old
hermit
be
the
very
man
of
whom
to
ask
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
Cold
,
he
may
be
;
little
sympathy
he
have
,
perhaps
,
with
human
passion
---
the
column
seem
too
tall
for
that
;
but
if
Truth
do
not
live
in
the
base
of
the
Monument
,
notwithstanding
Pope
's
couplet
about
the
outside
of
it
,
where
in
London
(
think
Tom
)
be
she
likely
to
be
find
!
   
<EOS>
come
close
below
the
pillar
,
it
be
a
great
encouragement
to
Tom
to
find
that
the
man
in
the
Monument
have
simple
taste
;
that
stony
and
artificial
as
his
residence
be
,
he
still
preserve
some
rustic
recollection
;
that
he
like
plant
,
hang
up
bird
-
cage
,
be
not
wholly
cut
off
from
fresh
groundsel
,
and
keep
young
tree
in
tub
.
<EOS>
the
man
in
the
Monument
,
himself
,
be
sit
outside
the
door
---
his
own
door
:
the
Monument
-
door
:
what
a
grand
idea
!
<EOS>
---
and
be
actually
yawn
,
as
if
there
be
no
Monument
to
stop
his
mouth
,
and
give
him
a
perpetual
interest
in
his
own
existence
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
be
advance
towards
this
remarkable
creature
,
to
inquire
the
way
to
Furnival
's
Inn
,
when
two
people
come
to
see
the
Monument
.
<EOS>
They
be
a
gentleman
and
a
lady
;
and
the
gentleman
say
,
"
how
much
a
-
piece
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
Man
in
the
Monument
reply
,
"
a
Tanner
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
seem
a
low
expression
,
compare
with
the
Monument
.
   
<EOS>
the
gentleman
put
a
shilling
into
his
hand
,
and
the
man
in
the
Monument
open
a
dark
little
door
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
gentleman
and
lady
have
pass
out
of
view
,
he
shut
it
again
,
and
come
slowly
back
to
his
chair
.
   
<EOS>
He
sit
down
and
laugh
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
do
not
know
what
a
many
step
there
be
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
worth
twice
the
money
to
stop
here
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
my
eye
!
"
   
<EOS>
the
Man
in
the
Monument
be
a
Cynic
;
a
worldly
man
!
 
<EOS>
Tom
could
not
ask
his
way
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
prepared
to
put
no
confidence
in
anything
he
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
gracious
!
<EOS>
"
cry
a
well

know
voice
behind
Mr
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
to
be
sure
it
be

"
   
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
he
be
poke
in
the
back
by
a
parasol
.
 
<EOS>
turn
round
to
inquire
into
this
salute

he

"

"
I

"
I

It

I

an

will
endeavour

find
my

I
fear
she
would
not

glad

that
unfortunate

you

<EOS>
there
be
something
hide
here
,
which
pique
Tom
's
interest
and
trouble
his
tender
heart
.
 
<EOS>
when
,
in
a
moment
's
irresolution
,
he
look
at
Charity
,
he
could
not
but
observe
a
struggle
in
her
face
between
a
sense
of
triumph
and
a
sense
of
shame
;
nor
could
he
but
remark
<EOS>
how
,
meet
even
his
eye
,
which
she
care
so
little
for
,
she
turn
away
her
own
,
for
all
the
splenetic
defiance
in
her
manner
.
   
<EOS>
an
uneasy
thought
enter
Tom
's
head
;
a
shadowy
misgiving
that
the
alter
relation
between
himself
and
Pecksniff
be
somehow
to
involve
an
altered
knowledge
on
his
part
of
other
people
,
and
be
to
give
him
an
insight
into
much
of
which
he
have
have
no
previous
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
he
put
no
definite
construction
upon
Charity
's
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
He
certainly
have
no
idea
that
as
he
have
be
the
audience
and
spectator
of
her
mortification
,
she
grasp
with
eager
delight
at
any
opportunity
of
reproach
her
sister
with
his
presence
in
HER
far
deep
misery
;
for
he
know
nothing
of
it
,
and
only
picture
that
sister
as
the
same
giddy
,
careless
,
trivial
creature
she
always
have
be
,
with
the
same
slight
estimation
of
himself
which
she
have
never
be
at
the
least
pain
to
conceal
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
have
merely
a
confused
impression
that
Miss
Pecksniff
be
not
quite
sisterly
or
kind
;
and
be
curious
to
set
it
right
,
accompany
her
as
she
desire
.
   
<EOS>
the
house
-
door
be
open
,
she
go
in
before
Tom
,
request
him
to
follow
her
;

lead
the
way
to
the
parlour
door

<EOS>
"

she

be

not

much

with

Miss

scream
her
way
out
of

parlour

call
on
Augustus
Moddle
to
appear
;
and
leave
Tom
Pinch
alone
with
her
sister

she
have
always
be
his
kind
friend

if
she
have
treat
him
through
all
his
servitude
with
such
consideration

be
never

receive
by
struggle
man
;
if
she
have
lighten
every
moment
of
those
many
year
,
and
have
ever
spare
and
never
wound
him
;
his
honest
heart
could
not
have
swell
before
her
with
a
deep
pity
,

a
purer
freedom
from
all
base
remembrance
than
it
do
then

gracious
me

He
have
not
expect
that
.
 
<EOS>
yet
he
do
not
feel
it
a
contradiction
that
he
should
be
sorry
to
see
her

so
unlike
her
old
self
,
and
sorry
at
the

time
to
hear
her
speak
in

old
manner

two
thing
seem

natural

be
very
busy
with
the
ribbon
as

speak

too
busy

the
work

<EOS>
"
We
never
quarrel

Tom

Tom
be
right
in
that
,
for
one
person
can
no
more
quarrel
without
an
adversary

play
at
chess

fight
a

She
look
at
him
for
a
moment
;
drop
her
bonnet
from
her
hand
;
spread
them
before
her
altered
face
,
and
burst
into
tear

now

for
certain

possibly
have
wish

she
seem

him
reproachfully

comfort

weep
bitterly

it

great

see
her
weeping

from
her
standing
in
especial
need

just
then

of
sympathy

tenderness

way

but
one
other
quarter
of
an
hour

if
he
have
extend
his
compassion
for
a
vain
,
unthinking
,
miserable
girl
,
in
but
the
least
degree
;
he
may
,
and
I
believe
he
would
,
have
save
her
!
 
<EOS>
tell
him
that
I
do
not
blame
him
,
but
be
grateful
for
the
effort
that
he
make
;
but
ask
him
for
the
love
of
God
,
and
youth
,
and
in
merciful
consideration
for
the
struggle
which
an
ill
-
advise
and
unwakened
nature
make
to
hide
the
strength
it
think
its
weakness
---
ask
him
never
,
never
,
to
forget
this
,
when
he
deal
with
one
again
!
"
   
<EOS>
although
Tom
do
not
hold
the
clue
to
her
full
meaning
,
he
could
guess
it
pretty
nearly
.
 
<EOS>
touch
to
the
quick
,
he
take
her
hand
and
say
,
or
mean
to
say

some
word
of
consolation

She
feel
and
understand

He
be

afterwards

that
she
have
try
to
kneel
down
at
his

bless
him

He

shake
her

<EOS>
Tom
have
never
see
Mrs
Todgers
,
it
be
needless
to
say
,
but
he
have
a
perception
of
her
be
the
lady
of
the
house
;
and
he
see
some
genuine
compassion
in
her
eye
,
that
win
his
good
opinion

at

He

<EOS>
Tom
infer
from
these
,
and
other
expression
of
the
same
nature
,
that
he
be
jealous
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
he
allow
him
to
take
his
own
course
;
which
be
such
a
gloomy
one
,
that
he
feel
a
load
remove
from
his
mind
when
they
part
company
at
the
gate
of
Furnival

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
to

I

John

reply
Tom
Pinch
,
who
be
breathless
with
the
haste
he
have
make
in
run
up
the
stair

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
if

Tom

"
I
will
tell

John

vow
he
would
not
touch
a
morsel
until
Tom
have
explain
himself
fully

<EOS>
so
Tom
sit
down
,
and
tell
him
all
;
to
which
he
listen
with
the
great
interest

<EOS>
He
know
Tom

well

respect
his
delicacy
too
much

to
ask
him
why
he
have
take
these
measure
without

<EOS>
He
quite
concur
in
the
expediency
of
Tom

immediately
return
to
his

as
he
know
so
little
of
the
place
in

he
have

humouredly
propose
to
ride
back

he
may
convey
his
box

<EOS>
Tom
's
proposition

he
should
sup
with

that
night

he

<EOS>
"

now
Tom

"
he
say
,
as
they
ride
along

"
I
have
a
question

John

though
why

I
do

the

of
Mr

man
of
mystery
to
the
Anglo

Bengalee
Disinterested

<EOS>
Mr
Nadgett
naturally
pass
away
from
Tom
's
remembrance
as
he
pass
out
of
his

;
for
he
do
not
know
him
,
and
have
never
hear
his
name

<EOS>
as
there

in
the
huge
metropolis
of
England
who
rise
up
every
morning
not
know
where

there

who
shoot
arrow

Mr

may
have
pass
Tom

ten
thousand
time
;
may
even
have
be
quite
familiar
with
his

his
name

and
character
;
yet
never
once
have
dream
that
Tom
have
any
interest
in
any
act

mystery
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
may
have
do
the

by
him
of
course

but
the

private

out
of
all
the

be
in
the

the

absorb
topic
of

<EOS>
why
Tom
have
Jonas

require
no

<EOS>
why
Mr

should
have
have
Jonas
Chuzzlewit
in

be
quite
another

but
,
somehow
or
other

that
amiable

worthy
orphan
have
become
a

<EOS>
Mr

take
an
interest
in
his
light
proceeding

it
never

He
watch
him
in

out
of

Assurance
Office

where
he
be
now
formally
instal
as
a
Director
;
he
dog
his
footstep
in
the

;
he
stand
listen
when
he

he
sit
in
coffee

room
enter
his
name
in
the
great
pocket

book
,
over

over
again
;
he
write
letter
to
himself
about
him
constantly
;
and
,
when
he
find
them
in
his
pocket
,
put
them
in
the
fire
,
with
such
distrust
and
caution
that
he
would
bend
down
to
watch
the
crumpled
tinder
while
it
float
upwards
,
as
if
his
mind
misgave
him
,
that
the
mystery
it
have
contain
may

Mr

's
eye
be
seldom

on
any
other
object
than
the
ground
,
the
clock
,
or
the
fire

but
every

his

may
have
be
an
eye

suspicion
in
this

suggest

but
that

He
go
about
so
stealthily
,
and
keep
himself
so
wrap
up
in
himself
,
that
the
whole

of
his
life
appear
to
be
,
to
avoid
notice
and
preserve
his

mystery
.
<EOS>
jona
sometimes
see
him
in
the
street
,
hover
in
the
outer
office
,
wait
at
the
door
for
the
man
who
never
come
,
or
slink
off
with
his
immovable
face
and
drooping
head
,
and
the
one
beaver
glove
dangle
before
him
;
but
he
would
as
soon
have
think
of
the
cross
upon
the
top
of
St.
Paul
's
Cathedral
take
note
of
what
he
do
,
or
slowly
wind
a
great
net
about
his
foot
,
as
of
Nadgett

such
an
occupation

<EOS>
Mr
Nadgett
make
a
mysterious
change
about
this
time
in
his
mysterious
life
:
for
whereas
he
have
,
until
now
,
be
first
see
every
morning
come
down
Cornhill
,
so
exactly
like
the
Nadgett
of
the
day
before
as
to
occasion
a
popular
belief
that
he
never
go
to
bed
or
take
his
clothe
off
,
he
be
now
first
see
in
Holborn
,
come
out
of
Kingsgate
Street
;
and
it
be
soon
discover
that
he
actually
go
every
morning
to
a
barber
's
shop
in
that
street
to
get
shave
;
and
that
the
barber
's
name
be
Sweedlepipe
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
to
make
appointment
with
the
man
who
never
come
,
to
meet
him
at
this
barber
's
;
for
he
would
frequently
take
long
spell
of
wait
in
the
shop
,
and
would
ask
for
pen
and
ink
,
and
pull
out
his
pocket
-
book
,
and
be
very
busy
over
it
for
an
hour
at
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
and
Mr
Sweedlepipe
have
many
deep
discoursing
on
the
subject
of
this
mysterious
customer
;
but
they
usually
agree
that
he
have
speculate
too
much
and
be
keep
out
of
the
way
.
   
<EOS>
He
must
have
appoint
the
man
who
never
keep
his
word
,
to
meet
him
at
another
new
place
too
;
for
one
day
he
be
find

for
the
first
time
,
by

sawdust
of
a
clean
spittoon
;
and
decline
to
call
for
anything
,
on
the
ground
of
expect
a
gentleman
presently
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
gentleman
be
not
honourable
enough
to
keep
his
engagement
,
he
come
again
next
day
,
with
his
pocket
-
book
in
such
a
state
of
distention
that
he
be

the
bar
as
a
man
of
large
property
.
 
<EOS>
after
that
,
he
repeat
his
visit
every
day
,
and
have
so
much
write
to
do
,
that
he
make
nothing
of
empty
a
capacious
leaden
inkstand
in
two
sitting
.
 
<EOS>
although
he

talk
much
,
still
,
by
be
there
among
the
regular
customer
,
he

their
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
course
of
time
become
quite
intimate
with
Mr
Tacker
,
Mr

and
even
with
Mr
Mould
himself
,
who
openly
say
he
be
a
long

headed
man
,
a
dry
one
,
a
salt
fish
,
a
deep
file
,
a
rasper
;
and
make
him
the
subject
of
many
other
flattering
encomium
.
   
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
too
,
he
tell
the
people
at
the
Assurance
Office
,
in
his
own
mysterious
way
,
that
there
be
something
wrong
(
secretly
wrong
,
of
course
)
in
his
liver
,
and
that
he
fear
he
must
put
himself
under
the
doctor
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
deliver
over
to
joble
upon
this
representation

and
though
Jobling
could
not
find
out
where
his
liver
be
wrong
,
wrong
Mr
Nadgett
say
it
be
;
observe
that
it

<EOS>
accordingly

his
watchfulness
of
everything
that
Mr

leave
unsaid

it

not
improbable
that
they
be

secretly

of
some
great
scheme
which
Mr

such
a

that
Mr

consider
it
necessary
to
repeat

loose

scrawl
they
be

and
of
very
uninviting
exterior

but
they
have
weighty
purpose
in
them

Mr

softly
raise
the

peer
out

beckon

nearer

from
red

!
 
<EOS>
well
may
she
,
laugh
musically
,
put
them
up
in
that
bless
little
pocket
of
hers
with
a
merry
pride
!
 
<EOS>
for
it
be
such
a
grand
novelty
to
be
mistress
of
anything
,
that
if
she
have
be
the
most
relentless
and
despotic
of
all
little
housekeeper
,
she
may
have
plead
just
that
much
for
her
excuse
,
and
have
be
honourably
acquit
.
   
<EOS>
so
far
from
be
despotic
,
however
,
there
be
a
coyness
about
her
very
way
of
pour
out
the
tea
,
which
Tom
quite
revel
in
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
she
ask
him
what
he
would
like
to
have
for
dinner
,
and
falter
out
"
chop
"
as
a
reasonably
good
suggestion
after
their
last
night
's
successful
supper
,
Tom
grow
quite
facetious
,
and
rally
her
desperately
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
Tom
,
"
say
his
sister
,
blush
,
"
I
be
not
quite
confident
,
but
I
think
I
could
make
a
beef
-
steak
pudding
,
if
I
try
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
in
the
whole
catalogue
of
cookery
,
there
be
nothing
I
should
like
so
much
as
a
beef
-
steak
pudding
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Tom
,
slap
his
leg
to
give
the
great
force
to
this
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
dear
,
that
be
excellent
!
 
<EOS>
but
if
it
should
happen
not
to
come
quite
right
the
first
time
,
"
his
sister
falter
;
"
if
it
should
happen
not
to
be
a
pudding
exactly
,
but
should
turn
out
a
stew
,
or
a
soup
,
or
something
of
that
sort
,
<EOS>
you
will
not
be
vex
,
Tom
,
will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
serious
way
in
which
she
look
at
Tom
;
the
way
in
which
Tom
look
at
her
;
and
the
way
in
which
she
gradually
break
into
a
merry
laugh
at
her
own
expense
,
would
have
enchant
you
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
Tom
"
this
be
capital
.
 
<EOS>
It
give
us
a
new
,
and
quite
an
uncommon
interest
in
the
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
We
put
into
a
lottery
for
a
beefsteak
pudding
,
and
it
be
impossible
to
say
what
we
may
get
.
 
<EOS>
We
may
make
some
wonderful
discovery
,
perhaps
,
and
produce
such
a
dish
as
never
be
know
before
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
be
at
all
surprise
if
we
do
,
Tom
,
"
return
his
sister
,
still
laugh
merrily
,
"
or
if
it
should
prove
to
be
such
a
dish
as
we
shall
not
feel
very
anxious
to
produce
again
;
but
the
meat
must
come
out
of
the
saucepan
at
last
,
somehow
or
other
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
We
can
not
cook
it
into
nothing
at
all
;
that
be
a
great
comfort
.
<EOS>
so
if
you
like
to
venture
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
least
doubt
,
"
rejoin
Tom
,
"
that
it
will
come
out
an
excellent
pudding
,
or
at
all
event
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
that
I
shall
think
it
so
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
naturally
something
so
handy
and
brisk
about
you
,
Ruth
,
that
if
you
say
you
could
make
a
bowl
of
faultless
turtle
soup
,
I
should
believe
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
and
Tom
be
right
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
precisely
that
sort
of
person
.
 
<EOS>
nobody
ought
to
have
be
able
to
resist
her
coax
manner
;
and
nobody
have
any
business
to
try
.
 
<EOS>
yet
she
never
seem
to
know
it
be
her
manner
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
good
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
she
wash
up
the
breakfast
cup
,
chat
away
the
whole
time
,
and
tell
Tom
all
sort
of
anecdote
about
the
brass
-
and
-
copper
founder
;
put
everything
in
its
place
;
make
the
room
as
neat
as
herself
;
<EOS>
---
you
must
not
suppose
its
shape
be
half
as
neat
as
her
though
,
or
anything
like
it
---
and
brush
Tom
's
old
hat
round
and
round
and
round
again
,
until
it
be
as
sleek
as
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
discover
,
all
in
a
moment
,
that
Tom
's
shirt
-
collar
be
fray
at
the
edge
;
and
fly
upstairs
for
a
needle
and
thread
,
come
fly
down
again
with
her
thimble
on
,
and
set
it
right
with
wonderful
expertness
;
never
once
stick
the
needle
into
his
face
,
although
she
be
hum
his
pet
tune
from
first
to
last
,
and
beat
time
with
the
finger
of
her
left
hand
upon
his
neckcloth
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
sooner
do
this
,
than
off
she
be
again
;
and
there
she
stand
once
more
,
as
brisk
and
busy
as
a
bee
,
tie
that
compact
little
chin
of
her
into
an
equally
compact
little
bonnet
;
intent
on
bustle
out
to
the
butcher
's
,
without
a
minute
's
loss
of
time
;
and
invite
Tom
to
come
and
see
the
steak
cut
,
with
his
own
eye
.
<EOS>
as
to
Tom
,
he
be
ready
to
go
anywhere
;
so
off
they
trot
,
arm
-
in
-
arm
,
as
nimbly
as
you
please
;
say
to
each
other
what
a
quiet
street
<EOS>
it
be
to
lodge
in
,
and
how
very
cheap
,
and
what
an
airy
situation
.
   
<EOS>
to
see
the
butcher
slap
the
steak
,
before
he
lay
it
on
the
block
,
and
give
his
knife
a
sharpening
,
be
to
forget
breakfast
instantly
.
<EOS>
It
be
agreeable
,
too
<EOS>
---
it
really
be
---
to
see
him
cut
it
off
,
so
smooth
and
juicy
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
savage
in
the
act
,
although
the
knife
be
large
and
keen
;
it
be
a
piece
of
art
,
high
art
;
there
be
delicacy
of
touch
,
clearness
of
tone
,
skillful
handling
of
the
subject
,
fine
shading
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
triumph
of
mind
over
matter
;
quite
.
   
<EOS>
perhaps
the
green
cabbage
-
leaf
ever
grow
in
a
garden
be
wrap
about
this
steak
,
before
it
be
deliver
over
to
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
butcher
have
a
sentiment
for
his
business
,
and
know
how
to
refine
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
see
Tom
put
the
cabbage
-
leaf
into
his
pocket
awkwardly
,
he
beg
to
be
allow
to
do
it
for
him
;
"
for
meat
,
"
he
say
with
some
emotion
,
"
must
be
humour
,
not
drive
.
"
   
<EOS>
back
they
go
to
the
lodging
again
,
after
they
have
buy
some
egg
,
and
flour
,
and
such
small
matter
;
and
Tom
sit
gravely
down
to
write
at
one
end
of
the
parlour
table
,
while
Ruth
prepare
to
make
the
pudding
at
the
other
end
;
for
there
be
nobody
in
the
house
but
an
old
woman
<EOS>
(
the
landlord
be
a
mysterious
sort
of
man
,
who
go
out
early
in
the
morning
,
and
be
scarcely
ever
see
)
;
and
save
in
mere
household
drudgery
,
they
wait
on
themselves
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
you
write
,
Tom
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
his
sister
,
lay
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
see
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Tom
,
lean
back
in
his
chair
,
and
look
up
in
her
face
,
"
I
be
very
anxious
,
of
course
,
to
obtain
some
suitable
employment
;
and
before
Mr
Westlock
come
this
afternoon
,
I
think
I
may
as
well
prepare
a
little
description
of
myself
and
my
qualification
;
such
as
he
could
show
to
any
friend
of
his
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
do
the
same
for
me
,
Tom
,
also
,
"
say
his
sister

cast
down
her
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
dearly
like
to
keep
house
for
you
and
take
care
of
you
always
,
Tom

we
be
not
rich
enough
for
that

<EOS>
"
We
be
not
rich

return
Tom
,
"
certainly
;
and
we
may
be
much
poor
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
will
not
part
if
we
can
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
no
;
we
will
make
up
our
mind
Ruth
,
that
unless
we
be
so
very
unfortunate
as
to
render
me
quite
sure
that
you
would
be
well
off
away
from
me
than
with
me
,
we
will
battle
it
out
together

I
be
certain
we
shall
be
happy

it
out
together

there
be
no

may

My

do

you
make

pudding

indeed

give
her
a

push

you
have
not

You

I
tell

you

go
to
work

you

aye
,
aye

<EOS>
that
she
be

and
in
such
pleasant
earnest

moreover
,
that
Tom
's
attention
wander
from
his
writing
every
moment

<EOS>
first
,
she
trip
downstairs
into
the
kitchen
for
the
flour
,
then
for
the
pie
-
board
,
then
for
the
egg
,
then
for
the
butter
,
then
for
a
jug
of
water

then
for
the
rolling

pin

then
for
a
pudding

basin
,
then
for
the
pepper
,
then
for
the
salt

make
a
separate
journey
for
everything

laugh
every
time
she
start
off
afresh

<EOS>
when
all
the
material
be
collect
she
be
horrify
to
find
she
have
no
apron
on
,

so
run
UPstairs
by
way
of
variety
,
to
fetch
it
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
put
it
on
upstairs
,
but
come
dance
down
with
it
in
her
hand
;
and
be
one
of
those
little
woman
to
whom
an
apron
be
a
most
become
little
vanity
<EOS>
,
it
take
an
immense
time
to
arrange
;
have
to
be
carefully
smooth
down
beneath
---
<EOS>
oh
,
heaven
,
what
a
wicked
little
stomacher
!
<EOS>
---
and
to
be
gather
up
into
little
plait
by
the
string
before
it
could
be
tie
,
and
to
be
tap
,
rebuke
,
and
wheedle
,
at
the
pocket
,
before
it
would
set
right
,
which
at
last
it
do
,
and
when
it
do
---
but
never
mind
;
this
be
a
sober
chronicle
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
there
be
her
cuff
to
be
tuck
up
,
for
fear
of
flour
;
and
she
have
a
little
ring
to
pull
off
her
finger
,
which
would
not
come
off
(
foolish
little
ring
!
)
;
and
during
the
whole
of
these
preparation
she
look
demurely
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
at
Tom
,
from
under
her
dark
eyelash
,
as
if
they
be
all
a
part
of
the
pudding
,
and
indispensable
to
its
composition

<EOS>
for
the
life

soul
of
him

Tom
could
get
no
further
in
his
writing
than
,
"

a
respectable
young
man

aged
thirty

five

and
this
,
notwithstanding
the
show
she
make
of
be
supernaturally
quiet
,
and
go
about
on
tiptoe
,
lest
she
should
disturb
him
;
which
only
serve
as
an
additional

his

keep
it
upon

I

the
inside

the
basin

his
busy
little
sister

"
not
more
than
you
do

I
dare
say

reply
Tom
,
laughing

for
I
believe
you
do

anything
about
it

what
an
infidel
you
be

else

you

turn
out
easily

it
be

for

-
surveyor
not

My
goodness

Tom

"
   
<EOS>
It
be
wholly
out
of
the
question
to
try
to
write
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
line
out
"
respectable
young
man
,
aged
thirty
-
five
;
"
and
sit
look
on
,
pen
in
hand
,
with
one
of
the
most
loving
smile
imaginable

<EOS>
such
a
busy
little
woman

she
be

<EOS>
so
full
of
self

importance
and
try
so
hard
not

seem
uncertain
about
anything

<EOS>
It
be
a
perfect
treat
to
Tom

see
her
with
her
brow
knit

and
her
rosy
lip
purse
up
,
knead
away
at
the
crust

roll
it
out

John

,
of

be
transfix
in
silent
admiration

he
hold
out
his
hand
to
Miss

Could

John

<EOS>
"
indeed

no

<EOS>
It
be
very
ungenerous
in
you

so
suspicious
of
me

I
repose
implicit
faith
in
you

<EOS>
I
have

Miss

<EOS>
She
laugh
at
this
,
but
they
soon
get
back
into
a
serious
vein
,
and
discuss
the
subject
with
profound
gravity
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
else
be
obscure
in
the
business
,
it
appear
to
be
quite
plain
that
Tom
be
offer
a
salary
of
one
hundred
pound
a
year
;
and
this
be
the
main
point
,
the
surround
obscurity
rather
set
it
off
than
otherwise
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
,
be
in
a
great
flutter
,
wish
to

for
Austin
Friars
instantly

they

nearly
an
hour

by
John

advice

before
they
depart

Tom
make
himself
as
spruce

he

before
leave
home

open
parlour
door

have
glimpse
of
that
brave
little
sister
brush
the

up
loose

decide
with
uncommon
indignation
that

pretty

the

always
make

They

look
peaceable

"

Mr

<EOS>
They

with
a
great
,
black

sprawl
splash
upon

as

draw
forth
a
piece
of
horse

hair

He
look
at

with
an
entire
freedom
from
any
such
expression
as
could
be
reasonably
construe
into
an
unusual
display
of
interest

<EOS>
after
a
short
silence
,
during
which
Mr
Fips
be
so
perfectly
unembarrassed
as
to
render
it
manifest
that
he
could
have
break
it
sooner
without
hesitation
,
if
he
have
feel
inclined
to
do
so

he
ask

Mr

make

John
answer
in
the
affirmative

<EOS>
"

Mr

<EOS>
Mr

some
little
difficulty
in

to
relieve

take
up

<EOS>
Tom
's
countenance
fall
;
for
he
think
this
equivalent
to
tell
him
that
his
appearance
do
not
answer
;
and
that
Fips
must
look
out
for
somebody
else

I

I

say
Fips

take
off
a
very
deep
impression
of
the
wafer

the
calf

his

look
steadily
at
Tom

Poor

incline
his

repeat
Mr

"
from
half

past
nine
to
four
o'clock

I

about

<EOS>
"
I
do

Tom

which
be
light

easy

I
be
sure
;

the

<EOS>

oh

the

the

<EOS>
Tom
be
delighted

<EOS>
"
perhaps
,

say
Mr

"
you

<EOS>
"
oh

<EOS>
cry
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
only
be

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
consider
yourself
engage

by
all
mean

"
say
Mr

you
could
not

me
at
the
Temple
Gate
in
Fleet
Street
,
in
an
hour
from
this
time

I
suppose
,
could
you
?

<EOS>
certainly
Tom
could

<EOS>
"
good
,
"
say
Mr
Fips
,
rise
.
 
<EOS>

then
I
will
show
you
the

you
can
begin
your
attendance
to

morrow
morning

<EOS>
in
an
hour

therefore

I
shall
see
you

You

Mr

<EOS>
very
good

<EOS>
take
care
how
you
go

<EOS>
It
be
rather
dark

"
   
<EOS>
with
this
remark
,
which
seem
superfluous
,
he
shut
them
out
upon
the
staircase
,
and
they
grope
their
way
into
the
street
again
.
<EOS>
the
interview
have
do
so
little
to
remove
the
mystery
in
which
Tom
's
new
engagement
be
involve
,
and
have
do
so
much
to
thicken
it
,
that
neither
could
help
smile
at
the
puzzle
look
of
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
They
agree
,
however
,
that
the
introduction
of
Tom
to
his
new
office
and
office
companion
could
hardly
fail
to
throw
a
light
upon
the
subject
;
and
therefore
postpone
its
further
consideration
until
after
the
fulfillment
of
the
appointment
they
have
make
with
Mr
Fips
.
   
<EOS>
after
look
at
John
Westlock
's
chamber
,
and
devote
a
few
spare
minute
to
the
Boar
's
Head
,
they
issue
forth
again
to
the
place
of
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
the
time
agree
upon
have
not
quite
come
;
but
Mr
Fips
be
already
at
the
Temple
Gate
,
and
express
his
satisfaction
at
their
punctuality
.
   
<EOS>
He
lead
the
way
through
sundry
lane
and
court
,
into
one
more
quiet
and
more
gloomy
than
the
rest
,
and
,
single
out
a
certain
house
,
ascend
a
common
staircase
;
take
from
his
pocket
,
as
he
go
,
a
bunch
of
rusty
key
.
 
<EOS>
stop
before
a
door
upon
an
upper
story
,
which
have
nothing
but
a
yellow
smear
of
paint
where
custom
would
have
place
the
tenant
's
name
,
he
begin
to
beat
the
dust
out
of
one
of
these
key
,
very
deliberately
,
upon
the
great
broad
handrail
of
the
balustrade
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
have
a
little
plug
make
,
"
he
say
,
look
round
at
Tom
,
after
blow
a
shrill
whistle
into
the
barrel
of
the
key
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
only
way
of
prevent
them
from
get
stop
up

<EOS>
You
will
find
the
lock
go
the
well
,
too
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
for
a
little
oil
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
thank
him
;
but
be
too
much
occupy
with
his
own
speculation
,
and
John
Westlock
's
look
,
to
be
very
talkative
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
Mr
Fips
open
the
door
,
which
yield
to
his
hand
very
unwillingly
,
and
with
a
horribly
discordant
sound
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
the
key
out
,
when
he
have
do
so
,
and
give
it
to
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
aye

aye

Mr

far

It

lie
deep
on
everything

in
one
part
,
where
a
ray
of
sun
shine
through
a
crevice
in
the
shutter
and
strike
upon
the
opposite
wall
,

go
twirl
round
and

be
the
only
thing
in
the
place
that
have
any
motion
about
it

when

freely

lift
up

rub

congenial

<EOS>
He
say
all
this
in
such
a
comfortable
,
easy
manner
,
that
Tom
could
only
rub
his
hand
,
and
nod
his
head
,
and
smile
in
acquiescence

he
be
still

Tom

<EOS>

what
be
more
,
Tom
,
"
say
John
Westlock
,
seat
himself
upon
a
pile
of
book
,
and
look
up
at
his
astonished
friend

"
he
be
evidently
not
come
back

so
here
you
be

<EOS>
under
rather
singular
circumstance
,
Tom

"
   
<EOS>
It
be
such
an
odd
affair
throughout
,
and
Tom
stand
there
among
the
book
with
his
hat
in
one
hand
and
the
key
in
the
other
,
look
so
prodigiously
confound
,
that
his
friend
could
not
help
laugh
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
himself
be
tickle
;
no
less
by
the
hilarity
of
his
friend
than
by
the
recollection
of
the
sudden
manner
in
which
he
have
be
bring
to
a
stop
,
in
the
very
height
of
his
urbane
conference
with
Mr
Fips
;
so
by
degree
<EOS>
Tom
burst
out
laugh
too
;
and
each
make
the
other
laugh
more
,
they
fairly
roar
.
   
<EOS>
when
they
have
have
their
laugh
out
,
which
do
not
happen
very
soon
,
for
give
John
an
inch
that
way
<EOS>
and
he
be
sure
to
take
several
ell
,
be
a
jovial
,
good
-
temper
fellow
,
they
look
about
them
more
closely
,
grope
among
the
lumber
for
any
stray
mean
of
enlightenment
that
may
turn
up
.
 
<EOS>
but
no
scrap
or
shre
of
information
could
they
find
.
 
<EOS>
the
book
be
mark
with
a
variety
of
owner
's
name
,
have
,
no
doubt
,
be
buy
at
sale
,
and
collect
here
and
there
at
different
time

but
whether
any
one
of
these
name
belong
to
Tom
's
employer
,
and
,
if
so
,
which
of
them
,
they
have
no
mean
whatever
of
determine
.
 
<EOS>
It
occur
to
John
as
a
very
bright
thought
to
make
inquiry
at
the
steward
's
office
,
to
whom
the
chamber
belong
,
or
by
whom
they
be
hold
;
but
he
come
back
no
wiser
than
he
go
,
<EOS>
the
answer
be
,
"
Mr
Fips
,
of
Austin
Friars
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
after
all
,
Tom
,
I
begin
to
think
it
lie
no
deep
than
this
.
 
<EOS>
Fips
be
an
eccentric
man
;
have
some
knowledge
of
Pecksniff
;
despise
him
,
of
course
;
have
hear
or
see
enough
of
you
to
know
that
you
be
the
man
he
want
;
and
engage
you
in
his
own
whimsical
manner
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
but
why
in
his
own
whimsical
manner
?
"
ask
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
why
do
any
man
entertain
his
own
whimsical
taste
?
 
<EOS>
why
do
Mr
Fips
wear
short
and
powder
,
and
Mr
Fips
's
next
-
door
neighbour
boot
and
a
wig
?
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
,
be
in
that
state
of
mind
in
which
any
explanation
be
a
great
relief
,
adopt
this
last
one
(
which
indeed
be
quite
as
feasible
as
any
other
)
readily
,
and
say
he
have
no
doubt
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
his
faith
at
all
shake
by
his
have
say
exactly
the
same
thing
to
each
suggestion
of
his
friend
's
in
turn
,
and
be
perfectly
ready
to
say
it
again
if
he
have
any
new
solution
to
propose
.
   
<EOS>
as
he
have
not
,
Tom
draw
down
the
window
-
sash
,
and
fold
the
shutter
;
and
they
leave
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
close
the
door
heavily
,
as
Mr
Fips
have
desire
him
;
try
it
,
find
it
all
safe
,
and
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
They
make
a
pretty
wide
circuit
in
go
back
to
Islington
,
as
they
have
time
to
spare
,
and
Tom
be
never
tired
of
look
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
well
<EOS>
he
have
John
Westlock
for
his
companion
,
for
most
people
would
have
be
weary
of
his
perpetual
stoppage
at
shop
-
window
,
and
his
frequent
dash
into
the
crowded
carriage
-
way
at
the
peril
of
his
life
,
to
get
the
well
view
of
church
steeple
,
and
other
public
building
.
 
<EOS>
but
John
be
charm
to
see
him
so
much
interested
,
and
<EOS>
every
time
Tom
come
back
with
a
beam
face
from
among
the
wheel
of
cart
and
hackney
-
coach
,
wholly
unconscious
of
the
personal
congratulation
address
to
him
by
the
driver
,
John
seem
to
like
him
better
than
before
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
no
flour
on
Ruth
's
hand
when
she
receive
them
in
the
triangular
parlour
,
but
there
be
pleasant
smile
upon
her
face
,
and
a
crowd
of
welcome
shine
out
of
every
smile
,
and
gleam
in
her
bright
eye
.
 
<EOS>
by
the
bye
,
how
bright
they
be
!
 
<EOS>
look
into
them
for
but
<EOS>
a
moment
,
when
you
take
her
hand
,
you
see
,
in
each
,
such
a
capital
miniature
of
yourself
,
represent
you
as
such
a
restless
,
flashing
,
eager
,
brilliant
little
fellow
---
    
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
if
you
could
only
have
keep
them
for
your
own
miniature
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
wicked
,
rove
,
restless
,
too
impartial
eye
<EOS>
,
it
be
enough
for
any
one
to
stand
before
them
,
and
,
straightway
,
there
he
dance
and
sparkle
quite
as
merrily
as
you
!
   
<EOS>
the
table
be
already
spread
for
dinner
;
and
though
it
be
spread
with
nothing
very
choice
in
the
way
of
glass
or
linen
,
and
with
green
-
handle
knife
,
and
very
mountebank
of
two
-
pronged
fork
,
which
seem
to
be
try
how
far
asunder
they
could
possibly
stretch
their
leg
without
convert
themselves
into
double
the
number
of
iron
toothpick
,
it
want
neither
damask
,
silver
,
gold
,
nor
china
;
no
,
nor
any
other
garniture
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
there
it
be
;
and
,
be
there
,
nothing
else
would
have
do
as
well
.
   
<EOS>
the
success
of
that
initiative
dish
;
that
first
experiment
of
her
in
cookery
;
be
so
entire
,
<EOS>
so
unalloyed
and
perfect
,
that
John
Westlock
and
Tom
agree
she
must
have
be
study
the
art
in
secret
for
a
long
time
past
;
and
urge
her
to
make
a
full
confession
of
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
exceedingly
merry
over
this
jest
,
and
many
smart
thing
be
say
concern
it
;
but
John
be
not
as
fair
in
his
behaviour
as
may
have
be
expect
,
for
,
after
lure
Tom
Pinch
on
for
a
long
time
,
he
suddenly
go
over
to
the
enemy
,
and
swear
to
everything
his
sister
say
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
as
Tom
observe
the
same
night
before
go
to
bed
,
it
be
only
in
joke
,
and
John
have
always
be
famous
for
be
polite
to
lady
,
even
when
he
be
quite
a
boy
.
 
<EOS>
Ruth
say
,
"
oh
!
indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
say
anything
else
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
astonish
how
much
three
people
may
find
to
talk
about
.
<EOS>
They
scarcely
leave
off
talk
once
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
not
all
lively
chat
which
occupy
them
;
for
when
Tom
relate
how
he
have
see
Mr
Pecksniff
's
daughter
,
and
what
a
change
have
fall
on
the
young
,
they
be
very
serious
.
   
<EOS>
John
Westlock
become
quite
absorb
in
her
fortune
;
ask
many
question
of
Tom
Pinch
about
her
marriage
,
inquire
whether
her
husband
be
the
gentleman
whom
Tom
have
bring
to
dine
with
him
at
Salisbury
;
in
what
degree
of
relationship
they
stand
towards
each
other
,
be
different
person
;
and
take
,
in
short
,
the
great
interest
in
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
then
go
into
it
,
at
full
length
;
he
tell
how
Martin
have
go
abroad
,
and
have
not
be
hear
of
for
a
long
time
;
how
Dragon
Mark
have
bear
him
company
;
how
Mr
Pecksniff
have
get
the
poor
old
doting
grandfather
into
his
power
;
and
how
he
basely
seek
the
hand
of
Mary
Graham
.
 
<EOS>
but
not
a
word
say
Tom
of
what
lie
hide
in
his
heart
;
his
heart
,
so
deep
,
and
true
,
and
full
of
honour
,
and
yet
with
so
much
room
for
every
gentle
and
unselfish
thought
;
not
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
,
Tom
!
 
<EOS>
the
man
in
all
this

most
confident
in
his
sagacity
and
shrewdness
;
the
man
in
all
this
world
most
proud
of
his
distrust
of
other
man
,
and
have
most
to
show
in
gold
and
silver
as
the
gain
belong
to
his
creed
;
the
meek
favourer
of
that
wise
doctrine
,
every
man
for
himself
,
and
God
for
us
all
(
there
be
high
wisdom

the

the
Eternal
Majesty

oh

never

of

the

him

when
all
his

weigh
against
a
simple

<EOS>
well
,
well
,
Tom
,
it
be
simple
too
,
though
simple
in
a
different
way
,
to
be
so
eager
touching
that
same
theatre
,
of
which
John
say
,
when
tea
be
do
,
he
have
the
absolute
command
,
so
far
as
take
party
in
without
the
payment
of
a
sixpence
be
concern
;
and
simpler
yet
,
perhaps
,
never
to
suspect
that
when
he
go
in
first
,
alone
,
he
pay
the
money
!
 
<EOS>
Simple
in
thee
,
dear
Tom
,
to
laugh
and
cry
so
heartily
at
such
a
sorry
show
,
so
poorly
show
;
simple
to
be
so
happy
and
loquacious
trudging
home
with
Ruth
;
simple
to
be
so
surprised
to
find
that
merry
present
of
a
cookery

book
await
her
in
the
parlour
next
morning
,
with

make
a
new
acquaintance

and
have
fresh
occasion
for
surprise
and
wonder
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
ghostly
air
about
these
uninhabite
chamber
in
the
Temple
,
and
attend
every
circumstance
of
Tom
's
employment
there
,
which
have
a
strange
charm
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
every
morning
when
he
shut
his
door
at
Islington
,
he
turn
his
face
towards
an
atmosphere
of
unaccountable
fascination
,
as
surely
as
he
turn
it
to
the
London
smoke
;
and
from
that
moment
it
thicken
round
and
round
him
all
day
long
,
until
the
time
arrive
for
go
home
again
,
and
leave
it
,
like
a
motionless
cloud
,
behind
.
   
<EOS>
It
seem
to
Tom
,
every
morning
,
that
he
approach
this
ghostly
mist
,
and
become
envelop
in
it

by
the
easy
succession

degree
imaginable

yard
of
the
Temple
,
be
the
first
preparation
.
<EOS>
every
echo
of
his
footstep
sound
to
him
like
a
sound
from
the
old
wall
and
pavement
,
want
language
to
relate
the
history
of
the
dim
,
dismal
room
;
to
tell
him
what
lose
document
be
decay
in
forget
corner
of
the
shut
-
up
cellar
,
from
whose
lattice
such
mouldy
sigh
come
breathe
forth
as
he
go
past
;
to
whisper
of
dark
bin
of
rare
old
wine
,
bricke
up
in
vault
among
the
old
foundation
of
the
Halls
;
or
mutter
in
a
low
tone
yet
dark
legend
of
the
cross
-
legged
knight
,
whose
marble
effigy
be
in
the
church
.
 
<EOS>
with
the
first
planting
of
his
foot
upon
the
staircase
of
his
dusty
office
,
all
these
mystery
increase
;
until
,
ascend
step
by
step
,
as
Tom
ascend
,
they
attain
their
full
growth
in
the
solitary
labour
of
the
day
.
   
<EOS>
every
day
bring
one
recurring
,
never
-
fail
source
of
speculation
.
 
<EOS>
this
employer
;
would
he
come
to
-
day
,
and
what
would
he
be
like
?
 
<EOS>
for
Tom
could
not
stop
short
at
Mr
Fips
;
he
quite
believe
that
Mr
Fips
have
speak
truly
,
when
he
say
he
act
for
another
;
and
what
manner
of
man
that
other
be
,
become
a
full
-
blow
flower
of
wonder
in
the
garden
of
Tom
's
fancy
,
which
never
fade
or
get
trodden
down
.
   
<EOS>
at
one
time
,
he
conceive
that
Mr
Pecksniff
,
repent
of
his
falsehood
,
may
,
by
exertion
of
his
influence
with
some
third
person
have
devise
these
mean
of
give
him
employment
.
 
<EOS>
He
find
this
idea
so
insupportable
after
what
have
take
place
between
that
good
man
and
himself
,
that
he
confide
it
to
John
Westlock
on
the
very
same
day
;
inform
John
that
he
would
rather
ply
for
hire
as
a
porter
,
than
fall
so
low
in
his
own
esteem
as
to
accept
the
small
obligation
from
the
hand
of
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
but
John
assure
him
that
he
(
Tom
Pinch
)
be
far
from
do
justice
to
the
character
of
Mr
Pecksniff
yet
,
if
he
suppose
that
gentleman
capable
of
perform
a
generous
action
;
and
that
he
may
make
his
mind
quite
easy
on
that
head
until
he
see
the
sun
turn
green
and
the
moon
black
,
and
at
the
same
time
distinctly
perceive
with
the
naked
eye
,
twelve
first
-
rate
comet
career
round
those
planet
.
 
<EOS>
in
which
unusual
state
of
thing
,
he
say
(
and
not
before
)
,
it
may
become
not
absolutely
lunatic
to
suspect
Mr
Pecksniff
of
anything
so
monstrous
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
he
laugh
the
idea
down
completely
;
and
Tom
,
abandon
it
,
be
throw
upon
his
beam
-
end
again
,
for
some
other
solution
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
Tom
attend
to
his
duty
daily
,
and
make
considerable
progress
with
the
book
;
which
be
already
reduce
to
some
sort
of
order
,
and
make
a
great
appearance
in
his
fairly
-
write
catalogue
.
 
<EOS>
during
his
business
hour
,
he
indulge
himself
occasionally
with
snatch
of
reading
;
which
be
often
,
indeed
,
a
necessary
part
of
his
pursuit
;
and
as
he
usually
make
bold
to
carry
one
of
these
goblin
volumes
home
at
night
(
always
bring
it
back
again
next
morning
,
in
case
his
strange
employer
should
appear
and
ask
what
have
become
of
it
)
,
he
lead
a
happy
,
quiet
,
studious
kind
of
life
,
after
his
own
heart
.
   
<EOS>
but
though
the
book
be
never
so
interesting
,
and
never
so
full
of
novelty
to
Tom
,
they
could
not
so
enchain
him
,
in
those
mysterious
chamber
,
as
to
render
him
unconscious
,
for
a
moment
,
of
the
light
sound
.
 
<EOS>
any
footstep
on
the
flag
without
set
him
listen
attentively
and
when
it
turn
into
that
house
,
and
come
up
,
up
,
up
the
stair
,
he
always
think
with
a
beat
heart
,
"
now
I
be
come
face
to
face
with
him
at
last
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
no
footstep
ever
pass
the
floor
immediately
below
:
except
his
own
.
   
<EOS>
this
mystery
and
loneliness
engender
fancy
in
Tom
's
mind
,
the
folly
of
which
his
common
sense
could
readily
discover
,
but
which
his
common
sense
be
quite
unable
to
keep
away
,
notwithstanding
;
that
quality
be
with
most
of
us
,
in
such
a
case
,
like
the
old
french
Police
---
quick
at
detection
,
but
very
weak
as
a
preventive
power
.
 
<EOS>
Misgivings
,
undefined
,
absurd
,
inexplicable
,
that
there
be
some
one
hiding
in
the
inner
room
---
walk
softly
overhead
,
peep
in
through
the
door
-
chink
,
do
something
stealthy
,
anywhere
where
he
be
not
---
come
over
him
a
hundred
time
a
day
,
make
it
pleasant
to
throw
up
the
sash
,
and
hold
communication
even
with
the
sparrow
who
have
build
in
the
roof
and
water
-
spout
,
and
be
twitter
about
the
window
all
day
long
.
   
<EOS>
He
sit
with
the
outer
door
wide
open
,
at
all
time
,
that
he
may
hear
the
footstep
as
they
enter
,
and
turn
off
into
the
chamber
on
the
low
floor
.
 
<EOS>
He
form
odd
prepossession
too
,
regard
stranger
in
the
street
;
and
would
say
within
himself
of
such
or
such
a
man
,
who
strike
him
as
have
anything
uncommon
in
his
dress
or
aspect
,
"
I
should
not
wonder
,
now
,
if
that
be
he
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
it
never
be
.
 
<EOS>
and
though
he
actually
turn
back
and
follow
more
than
one
of
these
suspect
individual
,
in
a
singular
belief
that
they
be
go
to
the
place
he
be
then
upon
his
way
from
,
he
never
get
any
other
satisfaction
by
it
,
than
the
satisfaction
of
know
it
be
not
the
case
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Fips
,
of
Austin
Friars
,
rather
deepen
than
illumine
the
obscurity
of
his
position
;
for
on
the
first
occasion
of
Tom
's
wait
on
him
to
receive
his
weekly
pay
,
he
say
:
   
<EOS>
"
oh
!
by
the
bye
,
Mr
Pinch
,
you
need
not
mention
it
,
if
you
please
!
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
think
he
be
go
to
tell
him
a
secret
;
so
he
say
that
he
would
not
on
any
account
,
and
that
Mr
Fips
may
entirely
depend
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
Mr
Fips
say
"
very
good
,
"
in
reply
,
and
nothing
more
,
Tom
prompt
him
:
   
"
not
on
any
account
,
"
repeat
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Fips
repeat
:
"
very
good
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
go
to
say
"
---
Tom
hint
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
dear
no
!
"
cry
Fips
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
however
,
see
Tom
confuse
,
he
add
,
"
I
mean
that
you
need
not
mention
any
particular
about
your
place
of
employment
,
to
people
generally
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
find
it
well
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
have
the
pleasure
of
see
my
employer
yet
,
sir
,
"
observe
Tom
,
put
his
week
's
salary
in
his
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
"
have
not
you
?
"
say
Fips
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
do
not
suppose
you
have
though
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
thank
him
,
and
to
know
that
what
I
have
do
so
far
,
be
do
to
his
satisfaction
,
"
falter
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
quite
right
,
"
say
Mr
Fips
,
with
a
yawn
.
 
<EOS>
"
highly
creditable
.
 
<EOS>
very
proper
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
hastily
resolve
to
try
him
on
another
tack
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
soon
have
finish
with
the
book
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
that
will
not
terminate
my
engagement
,
sir
,
or
render
me
useless
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
no
!
"
retort
Fips
.
 
<EOS>
"
plenty
to
do
;
plen
-
ty
to
do
!
 
<EOS>
be
careful
how
you
go
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
rather
dark
.
"
   
<EOS>
this
be
the
very
utmost
extent
of
information
Tom
could
ever
get
out
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
so
it
be
dark
enough
in
all
conscience
;
and
if
Mr
Fips
express
himself
with
a
double
meaning
,
he
have
good
reason
for
do
so
.
   
<EOS>
but
now
a
circumstance
occur
,
which
help
to
divert
Tom
's
thought
from
even
this
mystery
,
and
to
divide
them
between
it
and
a
new
channel
,
which
be
a
very
Nile
in
itself
.
   
<EOS>
the
way
it
come
about
be
this
.
 
<EOS>
have
always
be
an
early
riser
and
have
now
no
organ
to
engage
him
in
sweet
converse
every
morning
,
it
be
his
habit
to
take
a
long
walk
before
go
to
the
Temple
;
and
naturally
incline
,
as
a
stranger
,
towards
those
part
of
the
town
which
be
conspicuous
for
the
life
and
animation
pervade
them
,
he
become
a
great
frequenter
of
the
market
-
place
,
bridge
,
quay
,
and
especially
the
steam
-
boat
wharf
;
for
it
be
very
lively
and
fresh
to
see
the
people
hurry
away
upon
their
many
scheme
of
business
or
pleasure
,
and
it
make
Tom
glad
to
think
that
there
be
that
much
change
and
freedom
in
the
monotonous
routine
of
city
life
.
   
<EOS>
in
most
of
these
morning
excursion
<EOS>
Ruth
accompany
him
.
 
<EOS>
as
their
landlord
be
always
up
and
away
at
his
business
(
whatever
that
may
be
,
no
one
seem
to
know
)
at
a
very
early
hour
,
the
habit
of
the
people
of
the
house
in
which
they
lodge
correspond
with
their
own
.
 
<EOS>
thus
they
have
often
finish
their
breakfast
,
and
be
out
in
the
summer
air
,
by
seven
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
two
hour
'
stroll
they
part
at
some
convenient
point
;
Tom
go
to
the
Temple
,
and
his
sister
return
home
,
as
methodically
as
you
please
.
   
<EOS>
many
and
many
a
pleasant
stroll
they
have
in
Covent
Garden
Market
;
snuff
up
the
perfume
of
the
fruit
and
flower
,
wonder
at
the
magnificence
of
the
pineapple

catch

of

row
of

at
the
fat
bundle
of

with
which

shop
be
fortify
as
with
a
breastwork
;
and
,
at
the
herbalist

many

many

beneath

fast
asleep

oblivious

but
never
half
so
good
a
stroll
as
down
among
the
steamboat
on
a
bright

<EOS>
there

alongside

<EOS>
in

there
be
an
incessant
roar
from
every
packet

which
quite
express
and
carry
out
the
uppermost
emotion
of
the
scene

<EOS>
They
all
appear
to
be
perspire
and
bother
themselves
,
exactly
as
their
passenger
do
;
they
never
leave
off
fretting
and
chafe

in
their
own
hoarse
manner

be
always

out

even
when
they
have
leave
off
,
and
have
get
safely
out
into
the
current
,
on
the
small

they
begin
again
;
for
the
brave

them
all
,
be
stop
by
some

and
so
,

but
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
all
representation
that
this
particular
vessel
be
about
to
sail
for
Antwerp
,
persist
in
secrete
basket
of
refreshment
behind
bulk
-
head
,
and
water
-
cask
,
and
under
seat
;
and
very
great
confusion
prevail
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
so
amusing
,
that
Tom
,
with
Ruth
upon
his
arm
,
stand
look
down
from
the
wharf
,
as
nearly
regardless
as
it
be
in
the
nature
of
flesh
and
blood
to
be
,
of
an
elderly
lady
behind
him
,
who
have
bring
a
large
umbrella
with
her
,
and
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
this
tremendous
instrument
have
a
hooked
handle
;
and
its
vicinity
be
first
make
known
to
him
by
a
painful
pressure
on
the
windpipe
,
consequent
upon
its
have
catch
him
round
the
throat
.
<EOS>
soon
after
disengage
himself
with
perfect
good
humour
,
he
have
a
sensation
of
the
ferule
in
his
back
;
immediately
afterwards
,
of
the
hook
entangle
his
ankle
;
then
of
the
umbrella
generally
,
wander
about
his
hat
,
and
flap
at
it
like
a
great
bird
;
and
,
lastly
,
of
a
poke
or
thrust
below
the
rib
,
which
give
him
such
exceed
anguish
,
that
he
could
not
refrain
from
turn
round
to
offer
a
mild
remonstrance
.
   
<EOS>
upon
his
turning
round
,
he
find
the
owner
of
the
umbrella
struggle
on
tip
-
toe
,
with
a
countenance
expressive
of
violent
animosity
,
to
look
down
upon
the
steam
-
boat
;
from
which
he
infer
that
she
have
attack
him
,
stand
in
the
front
row
,
by
design
,
and
as
her
natural
enemy
.

"
what
a

ill

natured
person
you
must

Tom

cry
out
fiercely

<EOS>
---
mean
the
constabulary

and
go
on
to
say
,
shake
the
handle
of
the
umbrella
at
Tom
,
that
but
for
them
feller
never
be
in
the
way
when

would
have

him
in

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
instead
of
pursue
the
altercation
,
therefore
,
Tom
civilly
inquire
what
boat
she
want
to
go
on
board
of
?
   
<EOS>
"
I

It
would
not

be
unnatural
to

part

do
not

whatever
his

lead
her
quickly
down

disappear
himself

without
loosen
his
cloak
,
or
pause
on
the
crowded
deck
one
moment
longer
than
be
necessary
to
clear
their
way
to
that
part
of
the
vessel

Tom
have
not
hear
this
little
dialogue

for
his
attention
have
be
engage
in
an
unexpected
manner

a
hand
upon

sleeve
have
cause
him
to
look
round

just
when
Mrs

conclude
her
apostrophe

engine

and
on
his
right
arm
,
Ruth
be
on
his
left
,
he
find
their
landlord
,
to
his
great
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
not
so
much
surprised
at
the
man
's
be
there
,
as
at
his
have
get
close
to
him
so
quietly
and
swiftly
;
for
another
person
have
be
at
his
elbow
<EOS>
one
instant
before
;
and
he
have
not
in
the
meantime
be
conscious
of
any
change
or
pressure
in
the
knot
of
people
among
whom
he
stand
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
Ruth
have
frequently
remark
how
noiselessly
this
landlord
of
theirs
come
into
and
go
out
of
his
own
house
;
but
Tom
be
not
the
less
amazed
to
see
him
at
his
elbow
now

"
I
beg
your
pardon

Mr

in

you

<EOS>
if
he
do
not
,
it
be
curious
that
in
speak
he
should
have
single
out
from
all
the
crowd
the
very
people
whom
he
describe
;
and
should
have
glance
hastily
from

to
Tom

He
take
the
letter

whisper
Ruth
to
wait
till
he
return
,
which
would
be
immediately
;
and
run
down
the
step
with
all
the
expedition
he
could
make
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
so
many
people
go
down
,
so
many
other
come
up

such
heavy
good
in

transit
to

such
a
ringing
of
bell

blow

off

shouting

he
reach

go
down

describe
the
object

hear
footstep

<EOS>
what
be
Tom
's
astonishment
to
find
in
him
the
man
with

he
have
have
the
conflict

the
field

poor
Mercy

husband

Jonas

<EOS>
Tom
understand
him
to
say
,
what
the
devil
do
he
want

it
be
not
easy
to
make
out
what
he
say
;
he
speak
so
indistinctly

"
I

nothing

He
do
so

read
the
writing
on
the
inside

<EOS>
the
content
be
evidently
very
brief
;
not
more
perhaps
than
one
line
;
but
they
strike
upon
him
like
a
stone
from
a
sling
.
 
<EOS>
He
reel
back
as
he
read
.
   
<EOS>
His
emotion
be
so
different
from
any
Tom
have
ever
see
before
that
he
stop
involuntarily
.
 
<EOS>
Momentary
as
his
state
of
indecision
be
,
the
bell
cease
while
he
stand
there
,
and
a
hoarse
voice
call
down
the
step
,
inquire
if
there
be
any
to
go
ashore
?
   
<EOS>
"
yes

He
throw
open
another
door
as
he
speak

and
drag
,
rather
than
lead
,
her
forth
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
pale
and
frightened
,
and
amazed
to
see
her
old
acquaintance
;
but
have
no
time
to
speak
,
for
they
be
make
a
great
stir
above
;
and
Jonas
draw
her
rapidly
towards
the
deck
.
   
<EOS>
"
where

<EOS>
what
be
the
matter

<EOS>
He
turn
,
even
in
the
madness
of
his
hurry
,
and
scowl
darkly
back
at
Tom
,
shake
his
clenched
hand
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
many
human
face
capable
of
the
expression
with
which
he
accompany
that
gesture

<EOS>
He
drag
her
up
,
and
Tom
follow
them
.
 
<EOS>
across
the
deck
,
over
the
side
,
along
the
crazy
plank
,
and
up
the
step
,
he
drag
her
fiercely
;
not
bestow
any
look
on
her
,
but
gaze
upwards
all
the
while
among
the
face
on
the
wharf
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
he
turn
again
,
and
say
to
Tom
with
a
tremendous
oath
:
   
<EOS>
"
where

"
   
<EOS>
before
Tom
,
in
his
indignation

amazement

could
return
an
answer
to
a
question
he
so
little

Tom
behind

of
foreign
appearance

with
a
black
moustache
and
whisker

and
address
him
with
a
polite
composure
,
strangely
different
from
his
own
distracted
and
desperate
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"

good
fellow

in

so
near
him

that
he
could
not
help

all
that
pass
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
stand
there
,
with
his
sister
on
his
arm
,
expect
and
hope
to
have
an
opportunity
of
explain
his
strange
share
in
this
yet
strange
business
.
 
<EOS>
but
Jonas
have
not
raise
his
eye
from
the
ground
;
no
one
else
have
even
look
towards
him
;
and
before
he
could
resolve
on
any
course
of
action
,
they
be
all
go
.
   
<EOS>
He
gaze
round
for
his
landlord

<EOS>
but
he
have
do
that
more
than
once
already
,
and
no
such
man
be
to
be
see
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
still
pursue
this
search
with
his
eye
,
when
he
see
a
hand
beckon
to
him
from
a
hackney
-
coach
;
and
hurry
towards
it
,
find
it
be
Merry

<EOS>
She
address
him
hurriedly
,
but
bend
out
of
the
window
,
that
she
may
not
be

by
her
companion
,
Mrs
Gamp
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good

what
be
it

<EOS>
why
do
he
tell
me
last
night
to
prepare
for
a
long
journey
,
and
why
have
you
bring
us
back
like
criminal
?
 
<EOS>
Dear
Mr
Pinch
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
clasp
her
hand
distractedly
,
"
be
merciful
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
this
dreadful
secret

,
be
merciful

and
God
will
bless
you

"
if
any

Tom
,
"
trust
me
,
<EOS>
you
should
not
ask
in
vain

<EOS>
but
I
be
far
more
ignorant
and
weak
than
you

"
   
<EOS>
She
withdraw
into
the
coach
again
,
and
he
see
the
hand
wave
towards
him
for
a
moment
;
but
whether
in
reproachfulness
or
incredulity
or
misery
,
or
grief
,
or
sad
adieu
,
or
what
else
,
he
could
not
,
be
so
hurried
,
understand
.
 
<EOS>
she
be
go
now
;
and
Ruth
and
he
be
leave
to
walk
away
,
and
wonder
.
   
<EOS>
have
Mr
Nadgett
appoint
the
man
who
never
come

to
meet
him
upon
London
Bridge
that
morning
?
 
<EOS>
He
be
certainly
look
over
the
parapet
,
and
down
upon
the
steamboat
-
wharf
at
that
moment
.
 
<EOS>
It
could
not
have
be
for
pleasure
;
he

take
pleasure

<EOS>
no

He

Chapter
41
.
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
and
his
friend
,
arrive
at
a
pleasant
understanding
,
set
forth
upon
an
enterprise
 
<EOS>
the
office
of
the
Anglo
-
Bengalee
Disinterested
Loan
and
Life
Assurance
Company
be
near
at
hand
,
and
Mr
Montague
drive
Jonas
straight
there
,
they
have
very
little
way
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
journey
may
have
be
one
of
several
hour
'
duration
,
without
provoke
a
remark
from
either
;
for
it
be
clear
that
Jonas
do
not
mean
to
break
the
silence
which
prevail
between
them
,
and
that
it
be
not
,
as
yet
,
his
dear
friend
's
cue
to
tempt
them
into
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
throw
aside
his
cloak
,
as
have
now
no
motive
for
concealment
,
and
with
that
garment
huddle
on
his
knee
,
sit
as
far
remove
from
his
companion
as
the
limited
space
in
such
a
carriage
would
allow
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
striking
difference
in
his
manner
,
compare
with
what
it
have
be
,
within
a
few
minute
,
when
Tom
encounter
him
so
unexpectedly
on
board
the
packet
,
or
when
the
ugly
change
have
fall
on
him
in
Mr
Montague
's
dressing
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
the
aspect
of
a
man
find
out
and
hold
at
bay
;
of
be
baffle
,
hunt
,
and
beset
;
but
there
be
now
a
dawn
and
increase
purpose
in
his
face
,
which
change
it
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
gloomy
,
distrustful
,
lower
;
pale
with
anger
and
defeat
;
it
still
be
humble
,
abject
,
cowardly
and
mean
;
but
,
let
the
conflict
go
on
as
it
would
,
there
be
one
strong
purpose
wrestling
with
every
emotion
of
his
mind
,
and
cast
the
whole
series
down
as
they
arise
.
   
<EOS>
not
prepossess
in
appearance
at
the
good
of
time
,
it
may
be
readily
suppose
that
he
be
not
so
now
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
leave
deep
mark
of
his
front
tooth
in
his
nether
lip
;
and
those
token
of
the
agitation
he
have
lately
undergo
improve
his
look
as
little
as
the
heavy
corrugation
in
his
forehead
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
self
-
possess
now
;
unnaturally
self
-
possess
,
indeed
,
as
man
quite
otherwise
than
brave
be
know
to
be
in
desperate
extremity
;
and
when
the
carriage
stop
,
he
wait
for
no
invitation
,
but
leapt
hardily
out
,
and
go
upstairs
.
   
<EOS>
the
chairman
follow
him
;
and
close
the
board
-
room
door
as
soon
as
they
have
enter
,
throw
himself
upon
a
sofa
.
 
<EOS>
Jonas
stand
before
the
window
,
look
down
into
the
street
;
and
lean
against
the
sash
,
rest
his
head
upon
his
arm
.

"

Montague
at

again

<EOS>
Jonas

quite
silent
;
still
look
down
into
the
street
,
and
rest
his
head
upon
his
arm

Will

fiercely
round

My

You

I

a

discovery

I
take
an
early
opportunity

mention
in
your

,
in
that
spirit
of
confidence
which
I
really
hope
do
prevail
between
us
,
and
be
reciprocate
by
you

<EOS>
perhaps
there
be
something
in
it
;
perhaps
there
be
nothing

<EOS>
I
have
my
knowledge

opinion
on
the
subject

You
have
yours

I

to
point
out
to
you

that
you
have
be
weak

<EOS>
I
may
desire
to
turn
this
little
incident
to
my
account

(
indeed
,
I
do
---
<EOS>
I
will
not
deny
it

my
account
do
not

You
promise

gain

You

I
have

He
do
not

it
be
not

keep
his

thereabout

be
at
great
pain
to
speak
slowly

continue
to
stand
before

with
his
furtive
gaze
direct

moisten
his
dry
lip

It
may
have
strike
a
close

this
fix

steady
glance
of
Jonas

a
part

alteration

He
keep
it
rivet

one
spot

with

nothing

on

any
dangerous
end

hold
some
object
in
his
sight
to
steady
him

never
wander
from
it

lest
he
trip

Montague
be
quick

his
rejoinder

the
boisterous
manner
which
Jonas
have
exhibit
during

latter
part
of
this
conversation

and
which
have
go
on
rapidly
increase
with
almost
every
word
he
have
speak

from
the
time

he
look
his
honourable
friend
in
the
face
until
now

do
not
now
subside
,

,
remain
at
its
height
,
abide
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
most
unusual
with
him
at
any
period
;
most
inconsistent
with
his
temper

constitution
;
especially
unnatural
it
would
appear
in
one
so
darkly
circumstance
;
it
abide
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
like
the
effect
of
wine
,

any
ardent
drink
,
for
he
be
perfectly
coherent
.
 
<EOS>
It
even
make
him
proof
against
the
usual
influence
of
such
mean
of
excitement
;
for
,
although
he
drink
deeply
several
time
that
day
,
with
no
reserve
or
caution
,
he
remain
exactly
the
same
man
,
and
his
spirit
neither
rise
nor
fall
in
the
least
observable
degree

<EOS>
deciding
,
after
some
discussion
,
to
travel
at
night

in
order

business

break
in
upon

they
take
counsel
together
in
reference
to
the
mean
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Montague
be
of
opinion
that
four
horse
be
advisable
,
at
all
event
for
the
first
stage
,
as
throw
a
great
deal
of
dust
into
people
's
eye
,
in
more
sense
than
one
,
a
travel
chariot
and
four
lie
under
order
for
nine
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
Jonas
do
not
go
home
;
observe
,
that
his
be
oblige
to
leave
town
on
business
in
so
great
a
hurry
,
would
be
a
good
excuse
for
have
turn
back
so
unexpectedly
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
write
a
note
for
his
portmanteau
,
and
send
it
by
a
messenger
,
who
duly
bring
his
luggage
back
,
with
a
short
note
from
that
other
piece
of
luggage
,
his
wife
,
expressive
of
her
wish
to
be
allow
to
come
and
see
him
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
request
he
send
for
answer
,
"
she
have
better
;
"
and
one
such
threatening
affirmative
be
sufficient
,
in
defiance
of
the
english
grammar
,
to
express
a
negative
,
she
keep
away
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Montague
be
much
engage
in
the
course
of
the
day
,
Jonas
bestow
his
spirit
chiefly
on
the
doctor
,
with
whom
he

in
the
medical
officer
's
own
room

<EOS>
on
his
way
thither

appear
anxious

inquire
if

be
afraid
of
him

Mr

slyly
answer
,
"
no

he
believe
it
must
be
his
way
as

charge
with
much
the

before

<EOS>
Mr

to
,
or

to
speak
with
great
elegance

this
dialogue

<EOS>
as
soon
as
Jonas
be
go
he
beckon
Nadgett
to
him
with
the
feather
of

whisper
in

when
Montague

may
have
undertake
to

in

consequently
by
the

<EOS>
upon
his
waistcoat
there
be
one
solitary
drop
of
blood

He
be
dead
and
cold
;

have
be
murder

sir

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>

only
one

"
Sir
,
that

the

have

stab

<EOS>
have
be
stab
to
the
heart
with
such
dexterity
,
sir
,
that
he
have
die
instantly
,
and
have
bleed
internally
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
suppose
that
a
medical
friend
of
his
(
to
whom
suspicion
attach
)
have
engage
him
in
conversation
on
some
pretence
;
have
take
him
,
very
likely
,
by
the
button
in
a
conversational
manner
;
have
examine
his
ground
at
leisure
with
his
other
hand
;
have
mark
the
exact
spot
;
draw
out
the
instrument
,
whatever
it
be
,
when
he
be
quite
prepared
;
and
---
"
   
"
and
do
the
trick
,

suggest
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
exactly
so
,
"
reply
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
quite
an
operation
in
its
way
,
and
very
neat
.
 
<EOS>
the
medical
friend
never
turn
up
;
and
,
as
I
tell
you
,
he
have
the
credit
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
whether
he
do
it
or
not
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
have
have
the
honour
to
be
call
in
with
two
or
three
of
my
professional
brother
on
the
occasion
,
and
have
assist
to
make
a
careful
examination
of
the
wound
,
I
have
no
hesitation
in
say
that
it
would
have
reflect
credit
on
any
medical
man
;
and
that
in
an
unprofessional
person
it
could
not
but
be
consider
,
either
as
an
extraordinary
work
of
art
,
or
the
result
of
a
still
more
extraordinary
,
happy
,
and
favourable
conjunction
of
circumstance

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
His
hearer
be
so
much
interested
in
this
case
,
that
the
doctor
go
on
to
elucidate
it
with
the
assistance
of
his
own
finger
and
thumb
and
waistcoat
;
and
at
Jonas
's
request
,
he
take
the
further
trouble
of
go
into
a
corner
of
the
room
,
and
alternately
represent
the
murder
man
and
the
murderer
;
which
he
do
with
great
effect
.
 
<EOS>
the
bottle
be
empty
and
the
story
do
,
Jonas
be
in
precisely
the
same
boisterous
and
unusual
state
as
when
they
have
sit
down
.
 
<EOS>
if
,
as
Jobling
theorize
,
his
good
digestion
be
the
cause
,
he
must
have
be
a
very
ostrich

<EOS>
at
dinner
it
be
just
the

after
dinner
too

though
wine
be
drunk
in
abundance

various
rich
meat
eat
.
 
<EOS>
at
nine
o'clock
it
be
still
the

<EOS>
there
be
a
lamp
in
the
carriage
,
he
swear
they
would
take
a
pack
of
card
,

a
bottle
of
wine
;

with
these
thing
under

go
down

"
out

this

he
bestow
on

boot

He
alight
quickly

walk
back
into

where
Montague
be
light

conduct
Mr

with
him

<EOS>
He
give
the

a
shake

throw
him
roughly
aside
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
more
of
his
familiar
self
in
the
action
,
than
in
anything
he
have
do
that
day
;

he
break
out
laugh
immediately
afterwards
,
and
make
a
thrust
at
the
doctor
with
his
hand
,
in
imitation
of

go
out

Mr

the

's
prognostication
in
reference
to
the
weather
be
speedily
verify
.
 
<EOS>
although
the
weather
be
not
a
patient
of
his
,
and
no
third
party
have
require
him
to
give
an
opinion
on
the
case
,
the
quick
fulfilment
of
his
prophecy
may
be
take
as
an
instance
of
his
professional
tact
;
for
,
unless
the
threaten
aspect
of
the
night
have
be
perfectly
plain
and
unmistakable
,
Mr
Jobling
would
never
have
compromise
his
reputation
by
deliver
any
sentiment
on
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
He
use
this
principle
in
Medicine
with
too
much
success
to
be
unmindful
of
it
in
his
commonest
transaction
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
those
hot
,
silent
night
,
when
people
sit
at
window
listen
for
the
thunder
which
they
know
will
shortly
break
;
when
they
recall
dismal
tale
of
hurricane
and
earthquake
;
and
of
lonely
traveller
on
open
plain
,
and
lonely
ship
at
sea
,
strike
by
lightning
.
 
<EOS>
lightning
flash
and
quiver
on
the
black
horizon
even
now
;
and
hollow
murmuring
be
in
the
wind
,
as
though
it
have
be
blow
where
the
thunder
roll
,
and
still
be
charge
with
its
exhausted
echo
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
storm
,
though
gather
swiftly
,
have
not
yet
come
up
;
and
the
prevail
stillness
be
the
more
solemn
,
from
the
dull
intelligence
that
seem
to
hover
in
the
air
,
of
noise
and
conflict
afar
off
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
very
dark
;
but
in
the
murky
sky
there
be
masse
of
cloud
which
shine
with
a
lurid
light
,
like
monstrous
heap
of
copper
that
have
be
heat
in
a
furnace
,
and
be
grow
cold
.
 
<EOS>
these
have
be
advance
steadily
and
slowly
,
but
they
be
now
motionless
,
or
nearly
so
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
carriage
clatter
round
the
corner
of
the
street
,
it
pass
at
every
one
a
knot
of
person
who
have
come
there
---
<EOS>
many
from
their
house
close
at
hand
,
without
hat
---
to
look
up
at
that
quarter
of
the
sky
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
a
very
few
large
drop
of
rain
begin
to
fall
,
and
thunder
rumble
in
the
distance
.
   
<EOS>
Jonas
sit
in
a
corner
of
the
carriage
with
his
bottle
rest
on
his
knee
,
and
grip
as
tightly
in
his
hand
as
if
he
would
have
grind
its
neck
to
powder
if
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
instinctively
attract
by
the
night
,
he
have
lay
aside
the
pack
of
card
upon
the
cushion
;
and
with
the
same
involuntary
impulse
,
so
intelligible
to
both
of
them
as
not
to
occasion
a
remark
on
either
side
,
his
companion
have
extinguish
the
lamp
.
 
<EOS>
the
front
glass
be
down
;
and
they
sit
look
silently
out
upon
the
gloomy
scene
before
them
.
   
<EOS>
They
be
clear
of
London
,
or
as
clear
of
it
as
traveller
can
be
whose
way
lie
on
the
Western
Road
,
within
a
stage
of
that
enormous
city
.
 
<EOS>
occasionally
they
encounter
a
foot
-
passenger
,
hurry
to
the
near
place
of
shelter
;
or
some
unwieldy
cart
proceed
onward
at
a
heavy
trot
,
with
the
same
end
in
view
.
 
<EOS>
little
cluster
of
such
vehicle
be
gather
round
the
stable
-
yard
or
baiting
-
place
of
every
wayside
tavern
;
while
their
driver
watch
the
weather
from
the
door
and
open
window
,
or
make
merry
within
.
<EOS>
everywhere
the
people
be
dispose
to
bear
each
other
company
rather
than
sit
alone
;
so
that
group
of
watchful
face
seem
to
be
look
out
upon
the
night
and
them
,
from
almost
every
house
they
pass
.
   
<EOS>
It
may
appear
strange
that
this
should
have
disturb
Jonas
,
or
render
him
uneasy
;
but
it
do
.
 
<EOS>
after
mutter
to
himself
,
and
often
change
his
position
,
he
draw
up
the
blind
on
his
side
of
the
carriage
,
and
turn
his
shoulder
sulkily
towards
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
neither
look
at
his
companion
,
nor
break
the
silence
which
prevail
between
them
,
and
which
have
fall
so
suddenly
upon
himself
,
by
address
a
word
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
the
thunder
roll
,
the
lightning
flash
;
the
rain
pour
down
like
Heaven
's
wrath
.
 
<EOS>
surround
at
one
moment
by
intolerable
light
,
and
at
the
next
by
pitchy
darkness
,
they
still
press
forward
on
their
journey
.
 
<EOS>
even
when
they
arrive
at
the
end
of
the
stage
,
and
may
have
tarry
,
they
do
not
;
but
order
horse
out
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
nor
have
this
any
reference
to
some
five
minute
'
lull
,
which
at
that
time
seem
to
promise
a
cessation
of
the
storm
.
 
<EOS>
They
hold
their
course
as
if
they
be
impel
and
drive
by
its
fury
.
 
<EOS>
although
they
have
not
exchange
a
dozen
word
,
and
may
have
tarry
very
well
,
they
seem
to
feel
,
by
joint
consent
,
that
onward
they
must
go
.
   
<EOS>
louder
and
louder
the
deep
thunder
roll
,
as
through
the
myriad
hall
of
some
vast
temple
in
the
sky
;
fiercer
and
brighter
become
the
lightning
,
more
and
more
heavily
the
rain
pour
down
.
 
<EOS>
the
horse
(
they
be
travel
now
with
a
single
pair
)
plunge
and
start
from
the
rill
of
quiver
fire
that
seem
to
wind
along
the
ground
before
them
;
but
there
these
two
man
sit
,
and
forward
they
go
as
if
they
be
lead
on
by
an
invisible
attraction
.
   
<EOS>
the
eye
,
partaking
of
the
quickness
of
the
flashing
light
,
see
in
its
every
gleam
a
multitude
of
object
which
it
could
not
see
at
steady
noon
in
fifty

that
period

nest
of
bird
in

and
nook
;
face
full
of
consternation
in
the
tilt
waggon
that
come
tear
past
;
their
frightened
team
ring
out
a
warning
which
the
thunder
drown
;
harrow

plough
leave
out
in
field
;
mile
upon
mile
of

divide

,
with
the
distant
fringe
of
tree
as
obvious
as
the

in

field
close
at
hand
;
in
a
tremble
,
vivid
,
flicker
instant
,
everything
be
clear
and
plain
;
then
come
a
flush
of
red
into
the
yellow
light
;
a
change
to
blue
;
a
brightness
so
intense
that
there
be
nothing
else
but
light
;
and
then
the
deep
and
profound
darkness
.
   
<EOS>
the
lightning
be
very
crooked
and
very
dazzling
may
have
present
or
assist
a
curious
optical
illusion
,
which
suddenly
rise
before
the
startled
eye
of
Montague
in
the
carriage
,
and
as
rapidly
disappear
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
he
see
Jonas
with
his
hand
lift
,
and
the
bottle
clench
in
it
like
a
hammer
,
make
as
if
he
would
aim
a
blow
at
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
he
observe
(
or
so
believe
)
an
expression
in
his
face
---
a
combination
of
the
unnatural
excitement
he
have
show
all
day
,
with
a
wild
hatred
and
fear
---
which
may
have
render
a
wolf
a
less
terrible
companion
.
   
<EOS>
He
utter
an
involuntary
exclamation
,
and
call
to
the
driver
,
who
bring
his
horse
to
a
stop
with
all
speed
.
   
<EOS>
It
could
hardly
have
be
as
he
suppose
,
for
although
he
have
not
take
his
eye
off
his
companion
,
and
have
not
see
him
move
,
he
sit
recline
in
his
corner
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
the

Jonas

<EOS>
"
be
that
your

<EOS>
He
uncork
the
bottle
with
the
help
of
his
tooth
;
and
put
it
to
his
lip
,
take
a
long
draught
.

"
I
wish

never

recoil
instinctively

all

<EOS>
His
companion
put
his
head
out
of
window
for
a
moment
,
and
draw
it
in
again
,
observe
(
as
if
that
be
his
cause
of
anxiety
)
,
that
the
boy
be
drench

We

this

bluntly

so

move
forward
again

Montague
take
little

no

what
he
say

repeat
that
it

<EOS>
from
this
time
Jonas
recover
his
former
spirit
,
if
such
a
term
may
be
employ
to
express
the
state
in
which
he
have
leave
the
city
.
<EOS>
He
have
his
bottle
often
at
his
mouth
;
roar
out
snatch
of
song
,
without
the
least
regard
to
time
or
tune
or
voice
,
or
anything
but
loud
discordance
;
and
urge
his
silent
friend
to
be
merry
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
the
good
company
in
the
world
,
my
good
fellow
,
"
say
Montague
with
an
effort
,
"
and
in
general
irresistible
;
but
to
-
night
 
---
<EOS>
do
you
hear
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
ecod
!
<EOS>
I
hear
and
see
it
too
,
"
cry
Jonas
,
shade
his
eye
,
for
the
moment
,
from
the
lightning
which
be
flash
,
not
in
any
one
direction
,
but
all
around
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
of
that
?
 
<EOS>
It
do
not
change
you
,
nor
me
,
nor
our
affair

<EOS>
Chorus
,
chorus
,
   
<EOS>
It
may
lighten
and
storm
,
   
<EOS>
till
it
hunt
the
red
worm
     
<EOS>
from
the
grass
where
the
gibbet
be
drive
;
   
but
it
can
not
hurt
the
dead
,
   
<EOS>
and
it
will
not
save
the
head
     
<EOS>
that
be
doom'd
to
be
rifle
and
rive
.
   
<EOS>
that
must
be
a
precious
old
song
,
"
he
add
with
an
oath
,
as
he
stop
short
in
a
kind
of
wonder
at
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
hear
it
since
I
be
a
boy
,
and
how
it
come
into
my
head
now
,
unless
the
lightning
put
it
there
,
I
do
not
know

<EOS>
no

no

<EOS>
no

no

<EOS>
no

<EOS>

"
   
<EOS>
His
mirth
be
of
such
a
savage
and
extraordinary
character
,
and
be
,
in
an
inexplicable
way
,
at
once
so
suited
to
the
night
,
and
yet
such
a
coarse
intrusion
on
its
terror
,
that
his
fellow
-
traveller
,
always
a
coward
,
shrink
from
him
in
positive
fear
.
 
<EOS>
instead
of
Jonas
be
his
tool
and
instrument
,
their
place
seem
to
be
reverse
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
reason
for
this
too
,
Montague
think
;
since
the
sense
of
his
debasement
may
naturally
inspire
such
a
man
with
the
wish
to
assert
a
noisy
independence
,
and
in
that
licence
to
forget
his
real
condition
.
 
<EOS>
be
quick
enough
,
in
reference
to
such
subject
of
contemplation
,
he
be
not
long
in
take
this
argument
into
account
and
give
it
its
full
weight
.
 
<EOS>
but
still
,
he
feel
a
vague
sense
of
alarm
,
and
be
depressed
and
uneasy
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
certain
he
have
not
be
asleep
;
but
his
eye
may
have
deceive
him
;
for
,
look
at
Jonas
now
in
any
interval
of
darkness
,
he
could
represent
his
figure
to
himself
in
any
attitude
his
state
of
mind
suggest
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
he
know
full
well
that
Jonas
have
no
reason
to
love
him
;
and
even
take
the
piece
of
pantomime
which
have
so
impress
his
mind
to
be
a
real
gesture
,
and
not
the
working
of
his
fancy
,
the
most
that
could
be
say
of
it
be
,
that
it
be
quite
in
keeping
with
the
rest
of
his
diabolical
fun
,
and
have
the
same
impotent
expression
of
truth
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
he
could
kill
me
with
a
wish
,
"
think
the
swindler
,
"
I
should
not
live
long
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
resolve
that
when
he
should
have
have
his
use
of
Jonas
,
he
would
restrain
him
with
an
iron
curb
;
in
the
meantime
,
that
he
could
not
do
better
than
leave
him
to
take
his
own
way
,
and
preserve
his
own
peculiar
description
of
good
-
humour
,
after
his
own
uncommon
manner
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
great
sacrifice
to
bear
with
him
;
"
for
when
all
be
get
that
can
be
get
,
"
think
Montague
,
"
I
shall
decamp
across
the
water
,
and
have
the
laugh
on
my
side
---
and
the
gain
.
"
   
<EOS>
such
be
his
reflection
from
hour
to
hour
;
his
state
of
mind
be
one
in
which
the
same
thought
constantly
present
themselves
over
and
over
again
in
wearisome
repetition
;
while
Jonas
,
who
appear
to
have
dismiss
reflection
altogether
,
entertain
himself
as
before
.
<EOS>
They
agree
that
they
would
go
to
Salisbury
,
and
would
cross
to
Mr
Pecksniff
's
in
the
morning
;
and
at
the
prospect
of
delude
that
worthy
gentleman
,
the
spirit
of
his
amiable
son
-
in
-
law
become
more
boisterous
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
as
the
night
wear
on
,
the
thunder
die
away
,
but
still
roll
gloomily
and
mournfully
in
the
distance
.
 
<EOS>
the
lightning
too
,
though
now
comparatively
harmless
,
be
yet
bright
and
frequent
.
 
<EOS>
the
rain
be
quite
as
violent
as
it
have
ever
be
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
their
ill
-
fortune
,
at
about
the
time
of
dawn
and
in
the
last
stage
of
their
journey
,
to
have
a
restive
pair
of
horse
.
 
<EOS>
these
animal
have
be
greatly
terrify
in
their
stable
by
the
temp
;
and
come
out
into
the
dreary
interval
between
night
and
morning
,
when
the
glare
of
the
lightning
be
yet
unsubdue
by
day
,
and
the
various
object
in
their
view
be
present
in
indistinct
and
exaggerated
shape
which
they
would
not
have
wear
by
night
,
they
gradually
become
less
and
less
capable
of
control
;
until
,
take
a
sudden
fright
at
something
by
the
roadside
,
they
dash
off
wildly
down
a
steep
hill
,
fling
the
driver
from
his
saddle
,
draw
the
carriage
to
the
brink
of
a
ditch
,
stumble
headlong
down
,
and
throw
it
crash
over
.
   
<EOS>
the
traveller
have
open
the
carriage
door
,
and
have
either
jump
or
fall
out
.
 
<EOS>
Jonas
be
the
first
to
stagger
to
his
foot
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
sick
and
weak
,
and
very
giddy
,
and
reel
to
a
five
-
bar
gate
,
stand
hold
by
it
;
look
drowsily
about
as
the
whole
landscape
swam
before
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
by
degree
,
he
grow
more
conscious
,
and
presently
observe
that
Montague
be
lie
senseless
in
the
road
,
within
a
few
foot
of
the
horse
.
   
<EOS>
in
an
instant
,
as
if
his
own
faint
body
be
suddenly
animate
by
a
demon
,
he
run
to
the
horse
'
head
;
and
pull
at
their
bridle
with
all
his
force
,
set
them
struggle
and
plunge
with
such
mad
violence
as
bring
their
hoof
at
every
effort
nearer
to
the
skull
of
the
prostrate
man
;
and
must
have
lead
in
half
a
minute
to
his
brain
be
dash
out
on
the
highway
.
   
<EOS>
as
he
do
this
,
he
fight
and
contend
with
them
like
a
man
possess
,
make
them
wild
by
his
cry
.
   
<EOS>
"
Whoop
!
"
cry
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whoop
!
<EOS>
again
!
<EOS>
another

a

<EOS>
up

ye

"
   
<EOS>
as
he
hear
the
driver
,
who
have
rise
and
be
hurry
up
,
cry
to
him
to
desist
,
his
violence
increase
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hiilo

Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
"
the
gentleman
---
in
the
road
---
 
he
will
be
kill

"
   
<EOS>
the
same
shout
and
the
same
struggle
be
his
only
answer
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
man
dart
in
at
the
peril
of
his
own
life
,
save
Montague
's
,
by
drag
him
through
the
mire
and
water
out
of
the
reach
of
present
harm
.
 
<EOS>
that
do
,
he
run
to
Jonas
;
and
with
the
aid
of
his
knife
they
very
shortly
disengage
the
horse
from
the
break
chariot
,
and
get
them
,
cut
and
bleed
,
on
their
leg
again
.
 
<EOS>
the
postillion
and
Jonas
have
now
leisure
to
look
at
each
other
,
which
they
have
not
have
yet
.
   
<EOS>
"
presence
of

,
presence
of

cry
Jonas
,
throw
up
his
hand
wildly
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
would
you
have
do
without
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
the
other
gentleman
would
have
do
badly
without
me
,
"
return
the
man
,
shake
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
move

first

him
up

with

loud

"

do
you
think

"
   
<EOS>
They
both
turn
to
look
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
Jonas
mutter
something
to
himself
,
when
he
see
him
sit
up
beneath
the
hedge
,
look
vacantly
around
.
   
<EOS>
"
what

there

after
all

<EOS>
They
raise
him
,
and
he
try
to
walk
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
good
deal
shake
,
and
tremble
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
but
with
the
exception
of
a
few
cut

this
be
all

I

Jonas
reply
by
advise
him
with
a
curse
to
hold
his
tongue
,
and
to
go
somewhere

,
whither
he
be
not

likely

Montague

give
any
other

a
faint

<EOS>
after
some
discussion
the
driver
mount
the
horse
which
have
be
least
injure

take
the
lad
in
his

as

Jonas
make
no

rejoinder
than
such
as
his

express

they
proceed
in
company

They
have
three

four
good
mile
to
travel
;

the
way
be
not
make
easy
by
the
state
of
the
road

the
burden
by
which
they
be
embarrassed

their

stiff

sore
condition

<EOS>
after
a
sufficiently
long
and
painful
walk

they
arrive
at
the
Inn

have
knock
the
people
up
(
it
be

very
early
in
the
morning

,
send
out
messenger
to
see
to
the

its
content

a
surgeon

all
the
service
he
could
render

he
render
promptly

skilfully

he
give
it
as
his
opinion
that
the

be
labour

a
severe
concussion
of
the
brain
,
and
that
Mr
Bailey
's
mortal
course
be
run
.
   
<EOS>
if
Montague
's
strong
interest
in
the
announcement
could
have
be
consider
as
unselfish
in
any
degree
,
it
may
have
be
a
redeem
trait
in
a
character
that
have
no
such
lineament
to
spare
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
difficult
to
see
that
,
for
some
unexpresse
reason
best
appreciate
by
himself
,
he
attach
a
strange
value
to
the
company
and
presence
of
this
mere
child
.
 
<EOS>
when
,
after
receive
some
assistance
from
the
surgeon
himself
,
he
retire
to
the
bedroom
prepare
for
him
,
and
it
be
broad
day
,
his
mind
be
still
dwell
on
this
theme
,
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
have
lose
,
"
he
say
,
"
a
thousand
pound
than
lose
the
boy
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
return
home
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
resolve
upon
that
.
 
<EOS>
Chuzzlewit
shall
go
forward
first
,
and
I
will
follow
in
my
own
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
have
no
more
of
this
,
"
he
add
,
wipe
his
damp
forehead
.
 
<EOS>
"
twenty
-
four
hour
of
this
would
turn
my
hair
grey
!
"
   
<EOS>
after
examine
his
chamber
,
and
look
under
the
bed
,
and
in
the
cupboard
,
and
even
behind
the
curtain
,
with
unusual
caution
(
although
it
be
,
as
have
be
say
,
broad
day
)
,
he
double
-
lock
the
door
by
which
he
have
enter
,
and
retire
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
another
door
in
the
room
,
but
it
be
lock
on
the
outer
side
;
and
with
what
place
it
communicate
,
he
know
not
.
   
<EOS>
His
fear
or
evil
conscience
reproduce
this
door
in
all
his
dream
.
<EOS>
He
dream
that
a
dreadful
secret
be
connect
with
it
;
a
secret
which
he
know
,
and
yet
do
not
know
,
for
although
he
be
heavily
responsible
for
it
,
and
a
party
to
it
,
he
be
harass
even
in
his
vision
by
a
distract
uncertainty
in
reference
to
its
import
.
<EOS>
incoherently
entwine
with
this
dream
be
another
,
which
represent
it
as
the
hiding
-
place
of
an
enemy
,
a
shadow
,
a
phantom
;
and
make
it
the
business
of
his
life
to
keep
the
terrible
creature
close
up
,
and
prevent
it
from
force
its
way
in
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
with
this
view
Nadgett
,
and
he
,
and
a
strange
man
with
a
bloody
smear
upon
his
head
(
who
tell
him
that
he
have
be
his
playfellow
,
and
tell
him
,
too
,
the
real
name
of
an
old
schoolmate
,
forget
until
then
)
,
work
with
iron
plate
and
nail
to
make
the
door
secure
;
<EOS>
but
though
they
work
never
so
hard
,
it
be
all
in
vain
,
for
the
nail
break
,
or
change
to
soft
twig
,
or
what
be
bad
,
to
worm
,
between
their
finger
;
the
wood
of
the
door
splinter
and
crumble
,
so
that
even
nail
would
not
remain
in
it
;
and
the
iron
plate
curl
up
like
hot
paper
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
time
the
creature
on
the
other
side
---
whether
it
be
in
the
shape
of
man
,
or
beast
<EOS>
,
he
neither
know
nor
seek
to
know
---
 
be
gain
on
them
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
great
terror
be
when
the
man
with
the
bloody
smear
upon
his
head
demand
of
him
if
he
know
this
creature
name
,
and
say
that
he
would
whisper
it
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
the
dreamer
fall
upon
his
knee
,
his
whole
blood
thrill
with
inexplicable
fear
,
and
hold
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
but
look
at
the
speaker
's
lip
,
he
see
that
they
form
the
utterance
of
the
letter
"
J

;
and
cry
out
aloud
that
the
secret
be
discover
,
and
they
be
all
lose
,
he
awake
.
   
<EOS>
awoke
to
find
Jonas
stand
at
his
bedside
watch
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
that
very
door
wide
open

<EOS>
as
their

Jonas
retreat
a

the

"
It
be
your

Jonas
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
be
almost
inclined
to
ask
you
what
you
be
do
here

<EOS>
My

be
on
the
other
side
of
that
door

<EOS>
no

tell
me
last
night
not

open
it

I
think
it
lead
into

passage

be
come
out
to
order
breakfast

<EOS>
there
be
 
<EOS>
---
there
be
no

<EOS>
Montague
have
in
the
meantime
admit
the
man
with
his
hot
water
and
boot
,
who
hear
this

say
,
yes
,
there
be
;
and
pass
into
the
adjoining
room
to
point
it
out
,
at
the
head
of
the
bed
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
find
it
,
then
,
"
say
Jonas
;
"
it
be
all
the
same

<EOS>
Shall
I
order
breakfast
?
"
   
<EOS>
Montague
answer
in
the
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
when
Jonas
have
retire
,
whistle
,
through
his
own
room
,
he
open
the
door
of
communication
,
to
take
out
the
key
and
fasten
it
on
the
inner
side
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
take
out
already
.
   
<EOS>
He
drag
a
table
against
the
door
,
and
sit
down
to
collect
himself
,
as
if
his
dream
still
have
some
influence
upon
his
mind
.
   
<EOS>
"
an
evil
journey

he
repeat
several
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
an
evil
journey

but
I
will
travel
home
alone

<EOS>
I
will
have
no

<EOS>
His
presentiment
,
or
superstition
,
that
it
be
an
evil
journey
,
do
not
at
all
deter
him
from
do
the
evil

which
the

<EOS>
with
this
in
view
,
he
dress
himself
more
carefully
than
usual
to
make
a
favourable
impression
on
Mr
Pecksniff
;
and
,
reassure
by
his
own
appearance
,
the
beauty
of
the
morning
,
and
the
flashing
of
the
wet
bough
outside
his
window
in
the
merry
sunshine
,
be
soon
sufficiently
inspirit
to
swear
a
few
round
oath
,
and
hum
the
fag
-
end
of
a
song

Her

It

of

be
black

dreary
,
from
the

away
to

the

down

;

when

shiver
and
cower
together
at

at

as

<EOS>
as
a

She

She

rather
gruffly
:
   
<EOS>
"
a
pint
of

<EOS>
He
have
some
reason

for
if

in

he
could
scarcely

so

She

as

dart
an

without

it
,

walk
rapidly
up

down

kitchen
several
time

with
one
boot

a
stocking
on

,
mindful

resolution

he
have
already
gain
many
victory
over

he
resolve

conquer
now

steady
himself

pull
the
boot
off

pick
up
his

put
them
on

sit
down
again

<EOS>
He
could
not
help
thrust
his
hand
to
the
very
bottom
of
his
pocket

muttering
at
interval

so
forth

occasionally
shake
his

at

this
do
not

soon
arrive
at
Mr

house

at

gentleman

with
a
face
so
immovable

have
be
next

an
impossibility
for
the
most
acute
physiognomist
to
determine
what
he
be
think
about

whether
he
be
think
at
all

he
straightway
knock

<EOS>
a
person
of
Mr

observation
could
not
long
remain
insensible
to
the
fact
that
Mr

be
make
the
end
of
his
nose
very
blunt
against
the
glass
of
the
parlour
window

in
an
angular
attempt
to
discover
who
have
knock
at

door

nor
be
Mr

slow
to
baffle
this
movement
on
the
part

the
enemy

by
perch
himself
on
the
top
step
,

present
the
crown
of
his
hat
in
that
direction

possibly
Mr

have
already
see
him

soon
hear
his

creak

passage

affirmative

Mr

as
mildly
as

that
be
the
most
flattering
attention

could
receive

Whereupon
he
hand
Mark
the
scrap

retire

shut

door

Mark
think
it
prudent
to
subdue
his
personal
emotion

and
return
to
Martin
at
the
Dragon

<EOS>
They
be
not
unprepared
for
such
a
reception

suffer
an
hour

so
to
elapse
before
make
another
attempt

<EOS>
when
this
interval

go
by

they

to
keep

door
open

his
foot

when
anybody
come

by
that
mean
secure
an
enforced
parley

this
precaution
be
needless

for
the
servant

appear
almost
immediately

<EOS>
brush
quickly
past
her
as
he
have
resolve
in
such
a
case
to
do
<EOS>
,
Martin
(
closely
follow
by
his
faithful
ally

open
the
door
of
that
parlour
in
which
he
know
a
visitor
be
most
likely
to
be
find
;
pass
at
once
into
the
room

stand

without

in

recognition

Martin
see
the
old
man
droop
his
grey
head
,
and
hide
his
face
in
his
hand

It
smite
him
to
the
heart

<EOS>
in
his
most
selfish
and
most
careless
day

this
linger
remnant
of

ancient
love

this
buttress
of
a
ruined
tower

have
build
up
in

time
go
by

with
so
much
pride

hope

would
have
cause
a
pang
in
Martin
's
heart

<EOS>
but
now
,
change
for
the
well
in
his
bad
respect
;
look
through
an
altered
medium
on
his
former
friend
,
the
guardian
of
his
childhood
,
so
broken
and
bow
down
;
resentment
,
sullenness
,
self

confidence
,
and
pride
,
be
all
sweep
away
,
before
the
start
tear
upon
the
withered
cheek

He
could
not
bear
to
see
them

He
could
not
bear
to

they
fall
at
sight
of
him

He
could
not
bear
to
view
reflect
in
them

the
reproachful
and
irrevocable
past

<EOS>
He
hurriedly
advance
to
seize
the
old
man
's
hand
in
his
,
when
Mr
Pecksniff
interpose
himself
between

"
no

strike
himself
upon

"
I
only
hear

reply
Martin
,
strong
in
his
purpose
from
the
first
,
and
strong
in
it
as
he
feel
how
Pecksniff
winced
and
shrink
beneath
his
contempt
;
"
I
only
hear
what
you
say
to
me

"
   
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
well
for
Mr
Pecksniff
that
his
venerable
friend
find
in
his
<EOS>
(
Mr
Pecksniff
's
)
feature
an
exclusive
and
engrossing
object
of
contemplation
,
for
if
his

go
astray
,

he
have
compare
young
Martin
's
bearing
with
that
of
his
zealous
defender
,
the
latter
disintereste
gentleman
would
scarcely
have
show
to
great
advantage
than
on
the
memorable
afternoon
when
he
take
Tom
Pinch
's
last
receipt
in
full
of
all
demand
.
 
<EOS>
one
really
may
have
think
there
be
some
quality
in
Mr
Pecksniff
---
an
emanation
from
the
brightness
and
purity
within
him
perhaps
---
which
set
off
and
adorn
his
foe
;
they
look
so
gallant
and
so
manly
beside
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
not
a

Martin

for

I
remember
that
I

a
word
.
 
<EOS>
You
speak
of

indebte

the

of
some
stranger

the
mean
of
return
to
England

<EOS>
who
be
he
?
 
<EOS>
and
what
help
in
money
do
he
render
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
although
he
ask
this
question
of
Martin
,
he
do
not
look
towards
him
,
but
keep
his
eye
on
Mr
Pecksniff
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
It
appear
to
have
become
a
habit
with
him
,
both
in
a
literal
and
figurative
sense
,
to
look
to
Mr
Pecksniff
alone
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
take
out
his
pencil
,
tear
a
leaf
from
his
pocket

book

hastily
write
down
the
particular
of
his

to
Mr
Bevan

<EOS>
the

stretch
out
his

for
the

take
it
;

his

do
not
wander
from
Mr

"
It
would
be

false
humility

Martin
,
in

low
voice

to
say
,
I
do
not

that
I

the

at
this
proof
of

that

fain

clasp
the

convulsively

when

he
rise
up

break
off
immediately

appease
him

these
have
long

dwindle
away

defer
to
him
in
everything

and
as
he
make
no

conciliate
Mr

,

,
on
the

,
be
more
boorish

rude
to

that

so
far
from

lay
himself
out

for
it
be
in
the

the
tool

he
work
indispensable
to
knavery

and
know
what
he
would
do
himself
in
such
a

Mr

argue
,
"
if
this
young

want
anything

he
would
be
polite

deferential

<EOS>
the
more
Jonas
repel
him
in

inquiry

the
more
solicitous
,
therefore
,
Mr

become
to
be
initiate
into
the
golden
mystery
at

he
have
obscurely
glance

why
should
there

Little

do

malicious

inch

Jonas
rather
allow
the

than
parade
them
before

in

he
leave
Mr

to
infer
,
if
he
choose
(
which
he
do
choose
,
of
course
)
,
that
a
consciousness
of
not
have
any
great
natural
gift
of
speech

render
him
desirous
to
have
the
credit
of

Mr

<EOS>
some
one
who
be
well
endow
in
those
respect

so
atone
for

otherwise
,
he
mutter
discontentedly

he

have
see

off

take

prime
in

artful
manner

Mr

present
himself
at

time
in
such
a
state
of
suavity

benevolence

cheerfulness

politeness

cordiality

perhaps
never
attain
before

the

Oho

Montague

<EOS>
"
ha

"
and
here
they
all
laugh

Mr

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no

<EOS>
"
You
must
not

<EOS>
You
may
believe

<EOS>
"
upon

Mr

Montague

<EOS>
"
I
attach
the

<EOS>
money
can
not

quickly
enough

Mr

there

oh

Mr

Mr

I
give

again
they
all
laugh
in
concert
;
and
again
Mr
Pecksniff
laugh
especially
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
very
agreeable
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
confidential
,
easy
,
straight
-
forward
;
and
still
leave
Mr
Pecksniff
in
the
position
of
be
in
a
gentle
way
the
Mentor
of
the
party
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
achievement
in
the
article
of
cookery
that
the
Dragon
have
ever
perform
,
be
set
before
them
;
the
old
and
good
wine
in
the
Dragon
's
cellar
see
the
light
on
that
occasion
;
a
thousand
bubble
,
indicative
of
the
wealth
and
station
of
Mr
Montague
in
the
depth
of
his
pursuit
,
be
constantly
rise
to
the
surface
of
the
conversation
;
and
they
be
as
frank
and
merry
as
three
honest
man
could
be
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
think
it
a
pity
(
he
say
so
)
that
Mr
Montague
should
think
lightly
of
mankind
and
their
weakness
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
anxious
upon
this
subject
;
his
mind
run
upon
it
;
in
one
way
or
another
he
be
constantly
come
back
to
it
;
he
must
make
a
convert
of
him
,
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
often
as
Mr
Montague
repeat
his
sentiment
about
build
fortune
on
the
weakness
of
mankind
,
and
add
frankly
,
"
we
do
it
!
<EOS>
"
just
as
often
Mr
Pecksniff
repeat
"
oh
fie
!
<EOS>
oh
fie
,
for
shame
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
how
CAN
you
,
you
know
?
<EOS>
"
lay
a
great
stress
each
time
on
those
last
word
.
   
<EOS>
the
frequent
repetition
of
this
playful
inquiry
on
the
part
of
Mr
Pecksniff
,
lead
at
last
to
playful
answer
on
the
part
of
Mr
Montague
;
but
after
some
little
sharp
-
shooting
on
both
side
,
Mr
Pecksniff
become
grave
,
almost
to
tear
;
observe
that
if
Mr
Montague
would
give
him
leave
,
he
would
drink
the
health
of
his
young
kinsman
,
Mr
Jonas
;
congratulate
him
upon
the
valuable
and
distinguished
friendship
he
have
form
,
but
envy
him
,
he
would
confess
,
his
usefulness
to
his
fellow
-
creature
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
if
he
understand
the
object
of
that
institution
with
which
he
be
newly
and
advantageously
connect
---
know
them
but
imperfectly
---
they
be
calculate
to
do
good
;
and
for
his
(
Mr
Pecksniff
's
)
part
,
if
he
could
in
any
way
promote
them
,
he
think
he
would
be
able
to
lay
his
head
upon
his
pillow
every
night
,
with
an
absolute
certainty
of
go
to
sleep
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
the
transition
from
this
accidental
remark
(
for
it
be
quite
accidental
and
have
fall
from
Mr
Pecksniff
in
the
openness
of
his
soul
)
,
to
the
discussion
of
the
subject
as
a
matter
of
business
,
be
easy
.
 
<EOS>
book
,
paper
,
statement
,
table
,
calculation
of
various
kind
,
be
soon
spread
out
before
them
;
and
as
they
be
all
frame
with
one
object
,
it
be
not
surprising
that
they
should
all
have
tend
to
one
end
.
 
<EOS>
but
still
,
whenever
Montague
enlarge
upon
the
profit
of
the
office
,
and
say
that
as
long
as
there
be
gull
upon
the
wing
it
must
succeed
,
Mr
Pecksniff
mildly
say
"
oh
fie
!
"
<EOS>
---
 
and
may
indeed
have
remonstrate
with
him
,
but
that
he
know
he
be
joke
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
do
know
he
be
joke
;
because
he
say
so
.
   
<EOS>
there
never
have
be
before
,
and
there
never
would
be
again
,
such
an
opportunity
for
the
investment
of
a
considerable
sum
(
the
rate
of
advantage
increase
in
proportion
to
the
amount
invest
)
,
as
at
that
moment
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
time
that
have
at
all
approach
it
,
be
the
time
when
Jonas
have
come
into
the
concern
;
which
make
him
ill
-
natured
now
,
and
incline
him
to
pick
out
a
doubt
in
this
place
,
and
a
flaw
in
that
,
and
grumble
to
advise
Mr
Pecksniff
to
think
better
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
sum
which
would
complete
the
proprietorship
in
this
snug
concern
,
be
nearly
equal
to
Mr
Pecksniff
's
whole
hoard
;
not
count
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
that
be
to
say
,
whom
he
look
upon
as
money
in
the
Bank
,
the
possession
of
which
incline
him
the
more
to
make
a
dash
with
his
own
private
sprat
for
the
capture
of
such
a
whale
as
Mr
Montague
describe
.
 
<EOS>
the
return
begin
almost
immediately
,
and
be
immense
.
 
<EOS>
the
end
of
it
be
,
that
Mr
Pecksniff
agree
to
become
the
last
partner
and
proprietor
in
the
Anglo
-
Bengalee
,
and
make
an
appointment
to
dine
with
Mr
Montague
,
at
Salisbury
,
on
the
next
day
but
one
,
then
and
there
to
complete
the
negotiation
.
   
<EOS>
It
take
so
long
to
bring
the
subject
to
this
head
,
that
it
be
nearly
midnight
when
they
part
.
 
<EOS>
when
Mr
Pecksniff
walk
downstairs
to
the
door
,
he
find
Mrs
Lupin
stand
there
,
look
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
ah
,
my
good
friend
!
"
he
say
;
"
not
a
-
bed
yet
!
 
<EOS>
contemplate
the
star
,
Mrs
Lupin
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
beautiful
starlight
night
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
a
beautiful
starlight
night

"
say
Mr
Pecksniff
,
look
up
.
<EOS>
"
Behold
the

how
they
shine
!
 
<EOS>
Behold
the

this
morning

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
They
be

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
say
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
behold
the
wonder
of
the
firmament
,
Mrs
Lupin
!
<EOS>
how
glorious
be
the
scene

<EOS>
when
I
look
up
at
those
shine
orb
,
I
think
that
each
of
them
be
wink
to
the
other
to
take
notice
of
the
vanity
of
man
's
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
My
fellowman
!
"
cry
Mr
Pecksniff
,
shake
his
head
in
pity
;
"
you
be
much
mistaken
;
my
wormy
relative
,
you
be
much
deceive

<EOS>
the

He
ask

Chapter
45
.
<EOS>
in
which
TOM
PINCH
and
his
sister
take
a
little
pleasure
;
but
quite
in
a
domestic
way
,
<EOS>
and
with
no
ceremony
about
it
 
<EOS>
Tom
Pinch
and
his
sister
have
to
part
,
for
the
dispatch
of
the
morning
's
business
,
immediately
after
the
dispersion
of
the
other
actor
in
the
scene
upon
the
wharf
with
which
the
reader
have
be
already
make
acquainted
,
have
no
opportunity
of
discuss
the
subject
at
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
but
Tom
,
in
his
solitary
office
,
and
Ruth
,
in
the
triangular
parlour
,
think
about
nothing
else
all
day
;
and
,
when
their
hour
of
meeting
in
the
afternoon
approach
,
they
be
very
full
of
it
,
to
be
sure
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
plot
between
them
,
that
Tom
should
always
come
out
of
the
Temple
by
one
way
;
and
that
be
past
the
fountain
.
<EOS>
come
through
Fountain
Court
,
he
be
just
to
glance
down
the
step
lead
into
Garden
Court
,
and
to
look
once
all
round
him
;
and
if
Ruth
have
come
to
meet
him
,
there
he
would
see
her
;
not
saunter
,
you
understand
(
on
account
of
the
clerk
)
,
but
come
briskly
up
,
with
the
good
little
laugh
upon
her
face
that
ever
play
in
opposition
to
the
fountain
,
and
beat
it
all
to
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
fifty
to
one
,
Tom
have
be
look
for
her
in
the
wrong
direction
,
and
have
quite
give
her
up
,
while
she
have
be
trip
towards
him
from
the
first
;
jingle
that
little
reticule
of
her
(
with
all
the
key
in
it
)
to
attract
his
wander
observation
.
   
<EOS>
whether
there
be
life
enough
leave
in
the
slow
vegetation
of
Fountain
Court
for
the
smoky
shrub
to
have
any
consciousness
of
the
bright
and
purest
-
hearted
little
woman
in
the
world
,
be
a
question
for
gardener
,
and
those
who
be
learn
in
the
love
of
plant
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
that
it
be
a
good
thing
for
that
same
pave
yard
to
have
such
a
delicate
little
figure
flit
through
it
;
that
it
pass
like
a
smile
from
the
grimy
old
house
,
and
the
wear
flagstone
,
and
leave
them
dull
,
darker
,
sterner
than
before
;
there
be
no
sort
of
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
the
Temple
fountain
may
have
leap
up
twenty
foot
to
greet
the
spring
of
hopeful
maidenhood
,
that
in
her
person
steal
on
,
sparkle
,
through
the
dry
and
dusty
channel
of
the
Law

the
chirp
sparrow

cranny

may
have
hold
their
peace
to
listen
to
imaginary
skylark

as
so
fresh

creature
pass
;
<EOS>
the
dingy
bough
,
unused
to
droop
,
otherwise
than
in
their
puny
growth
,
may
have
bend
down
in
a
kindred
gracefulness
to
shed
their
benediction
on
her
graceful
head
;
old
love
letter
,
shut
up
in
iron
box
in
the
neighbouring
office
,
and
make
of
no
account
among
the
heap
of
family
paper
into
which
they
have
stray
,
and
of
which
,
in
their
degeneracy
,
they
form
a
part
,
may
have
stir
and
flutter
with
a
moment
's
recollection
of
their
ancient
tenderness
,
as
she
go
lightly
by
.
<EOS>
anything
may
have
happen
that
do
not
happen

never
will

for
the
love

something
happen
,
too
,
upon
the
afternoon
of
which
the
history
treat
.
 
<EOS>
not
for
her
love
.
 
<EOS>
oh
no
!
<EOS>
quite
by
accident
,
and
without
the
least
reference
to
her
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
either
she
be
a
little
too
soon
,
or
Tom
be
a
little
too
late
---
she
be
so
precise
in
general
,
that
she
time
it
to
half
a
minute
---
but
no
Tom
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
but
be
anybody
else
there
,
that
she
blush
so
deeply
,
after
look
round
,
and
trip
off
down
the
step
with
such
unusual
expedition
?
   
<EOS>
why
,
the
fact
be
,
that
Mr
Westlock
be
pass
at
that
moment
.
 
<EOS>
the
Temple
be
a
public
thoroughfare
;
they
may
write
up
on
the
gate
that
it
be
not
,
but
so
long
as
the
gate
be
leave
open
it
be
,
and
will
be
;
and
Mr
Westlock
have
as
good
a
right
to
be
there
as
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
but
why
do
she
run
away
,
then
?
 
<EOS>
not
be
ill
dress
,
for
she
be
much
too
neat
for
that
,
why
do
she
run
away
?
 
<EOS>
the
brown
hair
that
have
fall
down
beneath
her
bonnet
,
and
have
one
impertinent
imp
of
a
false
flower
cling
to
it
,
boastful
of
its
licence
before
all
man
<EOS>
,
that
could
not
have
be
the
cause
,
for
it
look
charming
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
foolish
,
pant
<EOS>
,
frightened
little
heart
,
why
do
she
run
away
!
   
<EOS>
merrily
the
tiny
fountain
play
,
and
merrily
the
dimple
sparkle
on
its
sunny
face
.
 
<EOS>
John
Westlock
hurry
after
her
.
 
<EOS>
softly
the
whisper
water
break
and
fall
;
as
roguishly
the
dimple
twinkle
,
as
he
steal
upon
her
footstep
.
   
<EOS>
oh
,
foolish
,
pant
<EOS>
,
timid
little
heart
,
why
do
she
feign
to
be
unconscious
of
his
come
!
 
<EOS>
why
wish
herself
so
far
away
,
yet
be
so
flutteringly
happy
there
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
feel
sure
it
be
you
,
"
say
John
,
when
he
overtake
her
in
the
sanctuary
of
Garden
Court
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
could
not
be
mistake
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
be
so
surprised
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
wait
for
your
brother
,
"
say
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
me
bear
you
company
.
"
   
<EOS>
so
light
be
the
touch
of
the
coy
little
hand
,
that
he
glance
down
to
assure
himself
he
have
it
on
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
glance
,
stop
for
an
instant
at
the
bright
eye
,
forget
its
first
design
,
and
go
no
farther
.
   
<EOS>
They
walk
up
and
down
three
or
four
time
,
speak
about
Tom
and
his
mysterious
employment
.
 
<EOS>
now
that
be
a
very
natural
and
innocent
subject
,
surely
.
 
<EOS>
then
why
,
whenever
Ruth
lift
up
her
eye
,
do
she
let
them
fall
again
immediately
,
and
seek
the
uncongenial
pavement
of
the
court
?
 
<EOS>
They
be
not
such
eye
as
shun
the
light
;
they
be
not
such
eye
as
require
to
be
hoard
to
enhance
their
value
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
much
too
precious
and
too
genuine
to
stand
in
need
of
art
like
those
.
 
<EOS>
somebody
must
have
be
look
at
them
!
   
<EOS>
They
find
out
Tom
,
though
,
quickly
enough
.
 
<EOS>
this
pair
of
eye
descry
him
in
the
distance
,
the
moment
he
appear
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
stare
about
him
,
as
usual
,
in
all
direction
but
the
right
one
;
and
be
as
obstinate
in
not
look
towards
them
,
as
if
he
have
intend
it
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
be
plain
that
,
be
leave
to
himself
,
he
would
walk
away
home
,
John
Westlock
dart
off
to
stop
him
.
   
<EOS>
this
make
the
approach
of
poor
little
Ruth
,
by
herself
,
one
of
the
most
embarrassing
of
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
Tom
,
manifest
extreme
surprise
(
he
have
no
presence
of
mind
,
that
Tom
,
on
small
occasion
)
;
there
be
John
,
make
as
light
of
it
as
he
could
,
but
explain
at
the
same
time
with
most
unnecessary
elaboration
;
and
here
be
she
,
come
towards
them
,
with
both
of
them
look
at
her
,
conscious
of
blush
to
a
terrible
extent
,
but
try
to
throw
up
her
eyebrow
carelessly
,
and
pout
her
rosy
lip
,
as
if
she
be
the
cool
and
most
unconcerned
of
little
woman
.
   
<EOS>
merrily
the
fountain
plash
and
plash
,
until
the
dimple
,
merge
into
one
another
,
swell
into
a
general
smile
,
that
cover
the
whole
surface
of
the
basin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
an
extraordinary
meeting
!
"
say
Tom

<EOS>
"
I
should
never
have
dream

see
you
two
together
here

<EOS>
"
quite
accidental

"
John
be
hear
to
murmur
.

exactly
,

cry
Tom
;
"
that
be
what
I
mean
,
you
know

if
it
be
not
accidental

there
would
be
nothing
remarkable
in
it

"
to

sure
,
"
say

<EOS>
"

such
an

way
place
for
you
to
have
meet
in

"
pursue
Tom
,
quite
delighted
.
 
<EOS>
"
such
an
unlikely
spot
!
"
   
<EOS>
John
rather
dispute
that
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
he
consider
it
a
very
likely
spot
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
constantly
pass
to
and
fro
there
,
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
He
should
not
wonder
if
it
be
to
happen
again
.
 
<EOS>
His
only
wonder
be
,
that
it
have
never
happen
before
.
   
<EOS>
by
this
time
Ruth
have
get
round
on
the
farther
side
of
her
brother
,
and
have
take
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
squeeze
it
now
,
as
much
as

Our

merrily
the

more

It

,
that
you

your

so
far
honour
a
poor
bachelor

<EOS>
It

close
by

<EOS>
Pray
,
Miss
Pinch
,
insist
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
very
disintereste
,
for
I
have
nothing
to
give
you

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
you
must
not
believe
that

Tom

<EOS>
"
He
be
the
most
tremendous
fellow
,
in
his
housekeeping

that
I
ever
hear
of

for
a

He
ought

Shall
we
go

<EOS>
"
if
you
please
,
Tom

"
rejoin
his
dutiful
little

"
<EOS>
but
I
mean
,
"
say
Tom
,
regard
her
with
smile
admiration
;
"
be
there
anything
you
ought
to
wear
,
and
have
not
get

<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
do
not
know

John

she
may
not
be
able
to
take
her
bonnet
off
,
for
anything
I
can
tell
.
"
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
deal
of
laugh
at
this
,
and
there
be
diver
compliment
from
John
Westlock
---
<EOS>
not
compliment
he
say
at
least
<EOS>
(
and
really
he
be
right
)
,
but
good
,
plain
,
honest
truth
,
which
no
one
could
deny
.
 
<EOS>
Ruth
laugh
,
and
all
that
,
but
she
make
no
objection
;
so
it
be
an
engagement
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
I
have
know
it
a
little
sooner
,
"
say
John
,
"
I
would
have
try
another
pudding
.
 
<EOS>
not
in
rivalry
;
but
merely
to
exalt
that
famous
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
on
any
account
have
have
it
make
with
suet
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
not
?
"
ask
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
because

John

<EOS>
"
oh
good
gracious

Tom

<EOS>
"
Ours

"
   
<EOS>
It
be
unnecessary
to
say
that
Tom
have
be
present
at
the
making
of
the
pudding
,
and
have
be
a
devoted
believer
in
it
all
through
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
so
delighted
to
have
this
joke
against
his
busy
little
sister
and
be
tickle
to
that
degree
at
have
find
her
out
,
that
he
stop
in
Temple
Bar
to
laugh
;
and
it
be
no
more
to
Tom
,
that
he
be
anathematize
and
knock
about
by
the
surly
passenger
,
than
it
would
have
be
to
a
post
;
for
he
continue
to
exclaim
with
unabated
good
humour
,
"
flour

<EOS>
a
beefsteak
pudding
make
with
flour

"
<EOS>
until
John
Westlock
and
his
sister
fairly
run
away
from
him
,
and
leave
him
to
have
his
laugh
out
by
himself
;
which
he
have
,
and
then
come
dodge
across
the
crowded
street
to
them
,
with
such
sweet
temper
and
tenderness
(
it
be
quite
a
tender
joke
of
Tom

)
beam
in
his
face
,
God
bless
it

that
it
may
have
purify
the
air

as
in
the
golden
day
go
by

embellish
with
a
row
of
rot
human
head
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
snug
chamber
in
those
Inns
where
the
bachelor
live
,
and
,
for
the
desolate
fellow
they
pretend
to
be
,
it
be
quite
surprising
how
well
they
get
on
.
 
<EOS>
John
be
very
pathetic
on
the
subject
of
his
dreary
life
,
and
the
deplorable
makeshift
and
apologetic
contrivance
it
involve
,
but
he
really
seem
to
make
himself
pretty
comfortable
.
 
<EOS>
His
room
be
the
perfection
of
neatness
and
convenience
at
any
rate

and
if
he
be
anything

comfortable
,
the
fault
be
certainly
not
theirs

<EOS>
He
have
no
sooner
usher
Tom
and
his
sister
into
his
good
room
<EOS>
(
where
there
be
a
beautiful
little
vase
of
fresh
flower
on
the
table
,
all
ready
for
Ruth
.
 
<EOS>
just
as
if
he
have
expect
her
,
Tom
say
)
,
than
,
seize
his
hat
,
he
bustle
out
again
,
in
his
most
energetically
bustling
,
way
;
and
presently
come
hurry
back
,
as
they
see
through
the
half
-
open
door
,
attend
by
a
fiery
-
faced
matron
attire
in
a
crunch
bonnet
,
with
particularly
long
string
to
it
hang
down
her
back
;
in
conjunction
with
whom
he
instantly
begin
to
lay
the
cloth
for
dinner
,
polish
up
the
wine

glass
with
his
own
hand
,
brighten
the
silver
top
of
the
pepper

caster
on
his
coat

sleeve
,
drawing
cork
and
fill
decanter
,
with
a
skill
and
expedition
that
be
quite
dazzling
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
if
,
in
the
course
of
this
rubbing
and
polishing
,
he
have
rub
an
enchant
lamp
or
a
magic
ring
,
obedient
to
which
there
be
twenty
thousand
supernatural

suddenly
there

under
his

Salmon

a
cool

,
sliced
cucumber

a

and
a
tart

all
there

<EOS>
They
all
come
at
the
right
time
.
 
<EOS>
where
they
come
from

but
the
oblong

be
constantly
go

and
make
its
arrival
know
to
the
man
in
the
white
waistcoat
by
bump
modestly
against

outside

after
its
first
appearance

He

he
never

wonder
at
the
extraordinary
thing
he
find
in
the
box

but
take
them
out
with
a
face
expressive
of
a
steady
purpose
and
impenetrable
character
,
and
put
them
on
the
table

<EOS>
He
be
a
kind
man

gentle
in
his
manner
,
and
much
interested
in
what
they
eat
and
drank

<EOS>
He
be
a
learned
man
,
and
know
the
flavour
of
John
Westlock

private
sauce
,
which
he
softly
and
feelingly
describe
,
as
he

the
little
bottle
round

He

only
pretend
to
grumble
.
"
   
<EOS>
no
,
John
really
do
not
appear
to
pretend
;
for
he
be
uncommonly
earnest
in
his
desire
to
have
it
understand
that
he
be
as
dull
,
solitary
,
and
uncomfortable
on
ordinary
occasion
as
an
unfortunate
young
man
could
,
in
reason
,
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
wretched
life

he

,
a
miserable
life

<EOS>
He

of
get
rid

soon

trifle
with
the
cherry
on

say
that
she

Mr

ought
to

quite
happy

that
she

no

he
be

talkative

<EOS>
on
Tom

relate
what
have
pass
upon
the
wharf
,
his
friend
be
very
much
surprised
,
and
take
such
a
great
interest
in
the
narrative
as
Tom
could
not
quite
understand
.
 
<EOS>
He
believe
he
know
the
old
lady
whose
acquaintance
they
have
make
,
he
say
;
and
that
he
may
venture
to
say
,
from
their
description
of
her
,
that
her
name
be
Gamp
.
 
<EOS>
but
of
what
nature
the
communication
could
have
be
which
Tom
have
bear
so
unexpectedly
<EOS>
;
why
its
delivery
have
be
entrust
to
him
;
how
it
happen
that
the
party
be
involve
together
;
and
what
secret
lie
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
affair
;
perplex
him
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
have
be
sure
of
his
take
some
interest
in
the
matter
;
but
be
not
prepare
for
the
strong
interest
he
show
.
 
<EOS>
It
hold
John
Westlock
to
the
subject
even
after
Ruth
have
leave
the
room
;
and
evidently
make
him
anxious
to
pursue
it
further
than
as
a
mere
subject
of
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
remonstrate
with
my
landlord

of
course

say
Tom
;
"
though
he
be
a
very
singular
secret
sort
of
man

not
likely
to
afford
me
much
satisfaction

even
if
he
know

be
in

<EOS>

which
you

do

John
interpose

<EOS>
"
You
think
so

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
certain
of
it

"
   
<EOS>
"
well
!
"
say
Tom
,
"
I
shall
remonstrate
with
him
when
I
see
him
(
he
go
in
and
out
in
a
strange
way

I
will
try

catch
him
tomorrow
morning

on
his
have
ask
me
to
execute
such

City

where
I
be
before

you
know

Mrs
Todgers
's
---
to

morrow
morning
,
I
may
find
poor
Mercy
Pecksniff
there
,
perhaps
,
and
be
able
to
explain
to
her
how
I
come
to
have
any
hand
in
the
business

"
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
perfectly
right

return
his
friend

after
a
short
interval
of
reflection

<EOS>
"
You
can
not
do
better
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
quite
clear
to
me
that
whatever
the
business
be
,
there
be
little
good
in
it
;
and
it
be
so
desirable
for
you
to
disentangle
yourself
from
any
appearance
of
willful
connection
with
it
,
that
I
would
counsel
you
to
see
her
husband
,
if
you
can
,
and
wash
your
hand
of
it
by
a
plain
statement
of
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
misgiving
that
there
be
something
dark
at
work
here
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
why
,
at
another
time
;
when
I
have
make
an
inquiry
or
two
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
all
this
sound
very
mysterious
to
Tom
Pinch

as
he
know
he
could
rely
upon
his
friend

he
resolve
to
follow
this
advice

ah

it
would
have
be
a
good

have
have
a
coat

invisibility

wherein
to
have
watch
little
Ruth
,
when
she
be
leave
to
herself
in
John
Westlock

chamber

and
John
and
her
brother
be
talk
thus
,
over
their
wine

<EOS>
the
gentle
way
in
which

up
a
little
conversation
with
the
fiery

faced
matron
in

crunch
bonnet

desperate
rally
in

her
dress

attire
herself
in
a
wash

out
yellow
gown
with
sprig
of
the

upon

so
that

would
have
be
pleasant

repel

proceed

consume

look
out
upon

<EOS>
there
be
little
enough
to

<EOS>
It
be
a
shady
,
quiet
place
,
echo
to
the
footstep
of
the
straggler
who
have
business
there
;
and
rather
monotonous
and
gloomy
on
summer
evening
.
 
<EOS>
what
give
it
such
a
charm
to
them
,
that
they
remain
at
the
window
as
unconscious
of
the
flight
of
time
as
Tom
himself
,
the
dreamer
,
while
the
melody
which
have
so
often
soothe
his
spirit
be
hover
again
about
him
!
 
<EOS>
what
power
infuse
into
the
fade
light
,
the
gathering
darkness
;
the
star
that
here
and
there
appear
;
the
evening
air
,
the
City
's
hum
and
stir
,
the
very
chiming
of
the
old
church
clock
;
such
exquisite
enthrallment
,
that
the
divine
region
of
the
earth
spread
out
before
their
eye
could
not
have
hold
them
captive
in
a
strong
chain
?
   
<EOS>
the
shadow
deepen
,
deepen
,
and
the
room
become
quite
dark
.
<EOS>
still
Tom

wander
over
the
key
of
the
piano
,
and
still
the
window
have
its
pair
of
tenant
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
her

upon
his

,
and
her
breath
upon
his

rouse
Tom
from
his
reverie

<EOS>
"

"
<EOS>
he
cry
,
desist
with
a
start

<EOS>
"
I

I

very
inconsiderate
and
unpolite

"
   
<EOS>
Tom
little

how
much
consideration
and
politeness
he

!
   
<EOS>
"

Hers

<EOS>
old

with

in

some
half

remember
legend

word

such
measure
that
the
strain
of
music
may
have
be
the
poet

breath
,
give
utterance
and
expression
to
his
thought
;
and
now
a
melody
so
joyous
and
light
-
hearted
,
that
the
singer
seem
incapable
of
sadness
,
until
in
her
inconstancy
(
oh
wicked
little
singer

)
<EOS>
she
relapse

and
break

these

<EOS>
"
well

<EOS>
everybody

Mrs

Augustus
inform

that
it

quite
a
joke
among

<EOS>
indeed
,

for
the
positive

load
fire

more
than

<EOS>
what
do
you

the
cause

his
digestion

his

<EOS>

He

always
ready

shed
tear

you
look

the

It

me
be
a
warning

<EOS>
do
not
try
the
feeling

make
you
an
offer

him

that
feel
find
expression

if

person
throw
himself
at
your
foot

as
Augustus
Moddle
do
at
mine

<EOS>
think
,
"
say

"
what
my
feeling
would
have
be
,
if
I
have
goad
him
to
suicide
,
and
it
have
get
into
the
paper
!
"
   
<EOS>
Ruth
observe
that
she
would
have
be
full
of
remorse

no

<EOS>
"
Remorse

Miss
Pecksniff

reparation
by

him

look
back

my
giddy
self

my

now
that
I
be
sober
down
and
make
thoughtful
,
by
tread
on
the
very
brink
of
matrimony

contemplate
myself
as
I
be

I
be
like
what
you
be
now

I
shudder

<EOS>
I
shudder

what
be
the
consequence

my
past
conduct

until
Augustus
lead
me
to
the
altar
he
be
not
sure
of
me

I
have
blight
and
wither
the
affection
of
his
heart
to
that
extent
that
he
be
not
sure
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
that
prey
on
his
mind

feed
on
his
vital
.

what
be
the
reproach
of
my
conscience
,
when
I
see
this
in
the
man
I
love

could

so
despondent
be
his

indeed
,
he
be
infinitely
more
rueful
then

he
have

,
sit
uncomfortably
upright
in
his
chair

survey
the

watery
eye

look
here

will
not

Christian

"
   
<EOS>
but
the
ecstasy
of
Mrs
Gamp
be
sufficient
to
have
furnish
forth
a
score
of
young

they
be
chiefly
awaken
by

She
add

impossible

for

it

silent
party

sigh

occasionally
give
himself
such
a
sound
slap
upon

as
would
make
Mrs

rarely

intent
upon
the

whatever
they

with

He
put
his

up

at
first
he
gaze
angrily
upon

as
upon
a
stranger
who
endeavour
to
deceive
him
;
but
peer
into
her
face
,
and
see
that
it

he
shake
his

sorrowful
compassion

She
make
a
sign
to
them
not
to
speak
to
him
,
which
indeed
they
have
little
inclination
to
do
;
and
remain
silent
herself
.
 
<EOS>
so
do
he
for
a
short
time
;
but
then
he
repeat
the
same
question
with
an
eagerness
that
have
a
peculiar
terror
in
it

<EOS>
"
there

gaze
at
her
as
if
he
doubt
what
she
say

have
not

and
,
rise
from
his
chair
,
walk
across
the
room
and
upstairs

whisper
as
he
go

"
foul

<EOS>
They
hear
his
footstep
overhead

go
up
into
that
corner
of
the
room
in
which
the
bed
stand
<EOS>
(
it

then
they
hear
him
come
down
again
immediately

His
fancy
be
not
so
strong
or
wild
that
it
picture
to
him
anything
in
the
desert
bedchamber

for
he
return
much
calm

appear
to
have
satisfy
himself

shrivelled

He
say
this
with
such
tremble
gap

pause
in
his
want
of
breath
,
and
say
it
in
his
jealous
secrecy
so
closely
in

ear

that
little
or
nothing
of
it
be
understand
by
the
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
have
hear
and
see
enough
of
the
old
man
to
be
disquiet
,
and
to
have
leave
their
seat
and
gather
about
him
;
thereby
afford
Mrs
Gamp
,
whose
professional
coolness
be
not
so
easily
disturb
,
an
eligible
opportunity
for
concentrate
the
whole
resource
of
her
powerful
mind
and
appetite
upon
the
toast
and
butter
,
tea
and
egg
.
<EOS>
She
have
bring
them
to
bear
upon
those
viand
with
such
vigour
that
her
face
be
in
the
high
state
of
inflammation
,
when
she
now
(
there
be
nothing
leave
to
eat

see
fit
to
interpose

<EOS>
"
why
,
highty
tighty
,
sir
!
"
cry
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
be
these
your
manner
?
<EOS>
You
want
a
pitcher
of
cold
water
throw'd
over
you
to
bring
you
round
;
that
be
my
belief
,
and
if
you
be
under
Betsey
Prig
you
would
have
it
,
too
<EOS>
,
I
do
assure
you
,
Mr
Chuffey

<EOS>
Spanish
Flies
be
the
only
thing
to
draw
this
nonsense
out
of
you
;
and
if
anybody
want
to
do
you
a
kindness
,
they
would
clap
a
blister
of
'em
on
your
head
,
and
put
a
mustard
poultige
on
your
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
who
be
dead

indeed

<EOS>
It

grievous
loss

no

with
the

out
the
precept
she
enforce
,
and
"
bother
the
old

in
practice
as
well
as
in
theory
<EOS>
,
Mrs
Gamp
take
him
by
the
collar
of
his
coat
,
and
give
him
some
dozen
or
two
of
hearty
shake
backward
and
forward
in
his
chair
;
that
exercise
be
consider
by
the
disciple
of
the
Prig
school
of
nursing
(
who
be
very
numerous
among
professional
lady
)
as
exceedingly
conducive
to
repose
,
and
highly
beneficial
to
the
performance
of
the
nervous
function
.
 
<EOS>
Its
effect
in
this
instance
be
to
render
the
patient
so
giddy
and
addle

head
,
that
he
could
say
nothing
more
;
which
Mrs
Gamp
regard
as

neither
Mrs

all

Tom

appear
to
be
dispose
to
differ
from

<EOS>
for
such
be
the
rash
boldness
of
the
uninitiated

that
they
will
frequently
set
up
some
monstrous
abstract
principle
,
such
as
humanity
,
or
tenderness
,
or
the
like
idle
folly
,
in
obstinate
defiance
of
all
precedent

usage

will
even
venture
to
maintain
the

against
the
person
who
have
make
the
precedent

establish
the
usage

who
must
therefore
be
the
good

most
impartial
judge

content

may

Her

He
pace
the

again
in
the

restless
and
unsteady
way
;
and
then
sit
down
upon
the
bedstead
,
lean
his
chin
upon
his
hand

and
look
at
the
table

when
he

do
it

He

again

It

slowly
change
it

<EOS>
slowly
,
slowly
;
darker
and
darker
;
more

more
haggard
;
creep
over
him
by
little

little
,
until
it
be
black

the

It

very
little
frequented

the
occasion
for

with
the

save
that
it

sometimes
serve
as
an
apology
for
a

that
the

have
once
hold
it
(

as

It
be
a

at

all
this
while
he
have

He

He

Would

They
cease
at

then
the
silence

He

They

He

Chapter

<EOS>
conclusion
of
the
enterprise
of
Mr
Jonas
and
his
friend
 
<EOS>
do
no
man
pass
through
the
dim
street
shrink
without
know
why
,
when
he
come
steal
up
behind
them
?
 
<EOS>
as
he
glide
on
,
have
no
child
in
its
sleep
an
indistinct
perception
of
a
guilty
shadow
fall
on
its
bed
,
that
trouble
its
innocent
rest
?
 
<EOS>
do
no
dog
howl
,
and
strive
to
break
its
rattle
chain
,
that
it
may
tear
him
;
no
burrowing
rat
,
scent
the
work
he
have
in
hand
,
essay
to
gnaw
a
passage
after
him
,
that
it
may
hold
a
greedy
revel
at
the
feast
of
his
providing
?
 
<EOS>
when
he
look
back
,
across
his
shoulder
,
be
it
to
see
if
his
quick
footstep
still
fall
dry
upon
the
dusty
pavement
,
or
be
already
moist
and
clog
with
the
red
mire
that
stain
the
naked
foot
of
Cain
!
   
<EOS>
He
shape
his
course
for
the
main
western
road
,
and
soon
reach
it
;
ride
a
part
of
the
way
,
then
alight
and
walk
on
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
travel
for
a
considerable
distance
upon
the
roof
of
a
stage
-
coach
,
which
come
up
while
he
be
afoot
;
and
when
it
turn
out
of
his
road
,
bribe
the
driver
of
a
return
post
-
chaise
to
take
him
on
with
him
;
and
then
make
across
the
country
at
a
run
,
and
save
a
mile
or
two
before
he
strike
again
into
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
as
his
plan
be
,
he
come
up
with
a
certain
lumbering
,
slow
,
night
-
coach
,
which
stop
wherever
it
could
,
and
be
stop
then
at
a
public
-
house
,
while
the
guard
and
coachman
eat
and
drank
within
.
   
<EOS>
He
bargain
for
a
seat
outside
this
coach
,
and
take
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
quit
it
no
more
until
it
be
within
a
few
mile
of
its
destination
,
but
occupy
the
same
place
all
night
.
   
<EOS>
all
night
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
common
fancy
that
nature
seem
to
sleep
by
night
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
false
fancy
,
as
who
should
know
better
than
he
?
   
<EOS>
the
fish
slumber
in
the
cold
,
bright
,
glisten
stream
and
river
,
perhaps
;
and
the
bird
roost
on
the
branch
of
the
tree
;
and
in
their
stall
and
pasture
beast
be
quiet
;
and
human
creature
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
of
that
,
when
the
solemn
night
be
watch
,
when
it
never
wink
,
when
its
darkness
watch
no
less
than
its
light
!
 
<EOS>
the
stately
tree
,
the
moon
and
shine
star
,
the
softly
stirring
wind
,
the
over

shadow
lane
,
the
broad
,
bright
countryside
<EOS>
,
they
all
keep
watch
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
blade
of
grow
grass
or
corn
,
but
watch
;
and
the
quieter
it
be
,
the
more
intent
and
fix
its
watch
upon
him
seem
to
be
.
   
<EOS>
and
yet
he
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
ride
on
among
those
sentinel
of
God
,
he
sleep
,
and
do
not
change
the
purpose
of
his
journey
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
forget
it
in
his
troubled
dream
,
it
come
up
steadily
,
and
wake
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
never
wake
him
to
remorse
,
or
to
abandonment
of
his
design
.
   
<EOS>
He
dream
at
one
time
that
he
be
lie
calmly
in
his
bed
,
think
of
a
moonlight
night
and
the
noise
of
wheel
,
when
the
old
clerk
put
his
head
in
at
the
door
,
and
beckon
him
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
signal
he
arise
immediately
---
be
already
dress
in
the
clothe
he
actually
wear
at
that
time
---
and
accompany
him
into
a
strange
city
,
where
the
name
of
the
street
be
write
on
the
wall
in
character
quite
new
to
him
;
which
give
him
no
surprise
or
uneasiness
,
for
he
remember
in
his
dream
to
have
be
there
before
.
 
<EOS>
although
these
street
be
very
precipitous
,
insomuch
that
to
get
from
one
to
another
<EOS>
it
be
necessary
to
descend
great
height
by
ladder
that
be
too
short
,
and
rope
that
move
deep
bell
,
and
swung
and
sway
as
they
be
clung
to
,
the
danger
give
him
little
emotion
beyond
the
first
thrill
of
terror
;
his
anxiety
be
concentrate
on
his
dress
which
be
quite
unfitted
for
some
festival
that
be
about
to
be
holden
there
,
and
in
which
he
have
come
to
take
a
part
.
<EOS>
already
,
great
crowd
begin
to
fill
the
street
,
and
in
one
direction
myriad
of
people
come
rush
down
an
interminable
perspective
,
strew
flower
and
make
way
for
other
on
white
horse
,
when
a
terrible
figure
start
from
the
throng
,
and
cry
out
that
it
be
the
last
day
for
all
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
the
cry
be
spread
,
there
be
a
wild
hurrying
on
to
judgment
;
and
the
press
become
so
great
that
he
and
his
companion
(
who
be
constantly
change
,
and
be
never
the
same
man
two
minute
together
,
though
he
never
see
one
man
come
or
another
go
)
,
stand
aside
in
a
porch
,
fearfully
survey
the
multitude
;
in
which
there
be
many
face
that
he
know
,
and
many
that
he
do
not
know
,
but
dream
he
do
;
when
all
at
once
a
struggle
head
rise
up
among
the
rest
---
livid
and
deadly
,
but
the
same
as
he
have
know
it
---
and
denounce
him
as
have
appoint
that
direful
day
to
happen
.
 
<EOS>
They
close
together
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
strove
to
free
the
hand
in
which
he
hold
a
club
,
and
strike
the
blow
he
have
so
often
think
of

he

the

before

<EOS>
They
be
loud
and
merry
in
their
conversation
,
and
may
have
be
hear
at
some
distance
;
far
above
the
sound
of
their
carriage
wheel
or
horse
'
hoofs
.
 
<EOS>
They
come
on
noisily
,
to
where
a
stile
and
footpath
indicate
their
point
of
separation
.
 
<EOS>
here
they
stop
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
too
soon
.
 
<EOS>
much
too
soon
,
"
say
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
this
be
the
place
,
my
dear
sir
.
 
<EOS>
keep
the
path
,
and
go
straight
through
the
little
wood
you
will
come
to
.
 
<EOS>
the
path
be
narrow
there
,
but
you
can
not
miss
it
.
 
<EOS>
when
shall
I
see
you
again
?
 
<EOS>
soon
I
hope
?

"
I

<EOS>
"

"
   
<EOS>
"
good
night
.
 
<EOS>
and
a
pleasant
ride

"
   
<EOS>
so
long
as
Mr
Pecksniff
be
in
sight
,
and
turn
his
head
at
interval
to
salute
him
,
Montague
stand
in
the
road
smile
,
and
wave
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
his
new
partner
have
disappear
,
and
this
show
be
no
longer
necessary
,
he
sit
down
on
the
stile
with
look
so
alter
,
that
he
may
have
grow
ten
year
old
in
the
meantime
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
flush
with
wine
,
but
not
gay
.
 
<EOS>
His
scheme
have
succeed
,
but
he
show
no
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
the
effort
of
sustain
his
difficult
part
before
his
late
companion
have
fatigue
him
,
perhaps
,
or
it
may
be
that
the
evening
whisper
to
his
conscience
,
or
it
may
be
(
as
it
have
be
)
that
a
shadowy
veil
be
drop
round
him
,
close
out
all
thought
but
the
presentiment
and
vague
foreknowledge
of
impend
doom
.
   
<EOS>
if
there
be
fluid
,
as
we
know
there
be
,
which
,
conscious
of
a
coming
wind
,
or
rain
,
or
frost
,
will
shrink
and
strive
to
hide
themselves
in
their
glass
artery
;
may
not
that
subtle
liquor
of
the
blood
perceive
,
by
property
within
itself
,
that
hand
be
raise
to
waste
and
spill
it
;
and
in
the
vein
of
man
run
cold
and
dull
as
his
do
,
in
that
hour
!
   
<EOS>
so
cold
,
although
the
air
be
warm
;
so
dull
,
although
the
sky
be
bright
;
that
he
rise
up
shiver
from
his
seat
,
and
hastily
resume
his
walk
.
 
<EOS>
He
check
himself
as
hastily
;
undecided
whether
to
pursue
the
footpath
,
which
be
lonely
and
retire
,
or
to
go
back
by
the
road
.
   
<EOS>
He
take
the
footpath
.
   
<EOS>
the
glory
of
the
depart
sun
be
on
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
the
music
of
the
bird
be
in
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
sweet
wild
flower
bloom
about
him
.
<EOS>
thatch
roof
of
poor
man
's
home
be
in
the
distance
;
and
an
old
grey
spire
,
surmount
by
a
Cross
,
rise
up
between
him
and
the
coming
night
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
never
read
the
lesson
which
these
thing
convey
;
he
have
ever
mock
and
turn
away
from
it
;
but
,
before
go
down
into
a
hollow
place
,
he
look
round
,
once
,
upon
the
evening
prospect
,
sorrowfully
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
go
down
,
down
,
down
,
into
the
dell
.
   
<EOS>
It
bring
him
to
the
wood
;
a
close
,
thick
,
shadowy
wood
,
through
which
the
path
go
wind
on
,
dwindle
away
into
a
slender
sheep
-
track
.
 
<EOS>
He
pause
before
enter
;
for
the
stillness
of
this
spot
almost
daunt
him
.
   
<EOS>
the
last
ray
of
the
sun
be
shine
in
,
aslant
,
make
a
path
of
golden
light
along
the
stem
and
branch
in
its
range
,
which
,
even
as
he
look
,
begin
to
die
away
,
yield
gently
to
the
twilight
that
come
creep
on
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
very
quiet
that
the
soft
and
stealthy
moss
about
the
trunk
of
some
old
tree
,
seem
to
have
grow
out
of
the
silence
,
and
to
be
its
proper
offspring
.
 
<EOS>
those
other
tree
which
be
subdue
by
blast
of
wind
in
winter
time
,
have
not
quite
tumble
down
,
but
be
catch
by
other
,
lie
all
bare
and
scathe
across
their
leafy
arm
,
as
if
unwilling
to
disturb
the
general
repose
by
the
crash
of
their
fall
.
 
<EOS>
Vistas
of
silence
open
everywhere
,
into
the
heart
and
innermost
recess
of
the
wood
;
begin
with
the
likeness
of
an
aisle
,
a
cloister
,
or
a
ruin
open
to
the
sky
;
then
tangle
off
into
a
deep
green
rustling
mystery
,
through
which
gnarl
trunk
,
and
twist
bough
,
and
ivy
-
cover

,
and
tremble

and

out
at
length
,
be
faintly
see
in
beautiful
confusion
.
   
<EOS>
as
the
sunlight
die
away
,
and
evening
fall
upon
the
wood
,
he
enter
it
.
 
<EOS>
Moving
,
here
and
there
a
bramble
or
a
drooping
bough
which
stretch
across
his
path
,
he
slowly
disappear
.
 
<EOS>
at
interval
a
narrow
opening
show
him
pass
on
,
or
the
sharp
cracking
of
some
tender
branch
denote
where
he
go
;
then
,
he
be
see
or
hear
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
never
more
beheld
by
mortal
eye
or
hear
by
mortal
ear
;
one
man
except
.
 
<EOS>
that
man
,
part
the
leave
and
branch
on
the
other
side
,
near
where
the
path
emerge
again
,
come
leap
out
soon
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
what
have
he
leave
within
the
wood
,
that
he
spring
out
of
it
as
if
it
be
a
hell
!
   
<EOS>
the
body
of
a
murdered
man
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
thick
solitary
spot
,
it
lie
among
the
last
year
's
leave
of
oak
and
beech
,
just
as
it
have
fall
headlong
down
.
 
<EOS>
sop
and
soak
in
among
the
leave
that
form
its
pillow
;
ooze
down
into
the
boggy
ground
,
as
if
to
cover
itself
from
human
sight
;
force
its
way
between
and
through
the
curl
leave
,
as
if
those
senseless
thing
reject
and
forswore
it
and
be
coil
up
in
abhorrence
;
go
a
dark
,
dark
stain
that
dye
the
whole
summer
night
from
earth
to
heaven
.
   
<EOS>
the
doer
of
this
deed
come
leap
from
the
wood
so
fiercely
,
that
he
cast
into
the
air
a
shower
of
fragment
of
young
bough
,
tear
away
in
his
passage
,
and
fall
with
violence
upon
the
grass
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
quickly
gain
his
foot
again
,
and
keep
underneath
a
hedge
with
his
body
bent
,
go
run
on
towards
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
the
road
once
reach
,
he
fall
into
a
rapid
walk
,
and
set
on
toward
London
.
   
<EOS>
and
he
be
not
sorry
for
what
he
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
frightened
when
he
think
of
it
<EOS>
---
when
do
he
not
think
of
it
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
but
he
be
not
sorry
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
have
a
terror
and
dread
of
the
wood
when
he
be
in
it
;
but
be
out
of
it
,
and
have
commit
the
crime
,
his
fear
be
now
divert
,
strangely
,
to
the
dark
room
he
have
leave
shut
up
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
great
horror
,
infinitely
great
,
of
that
room
than
of
the
wood
.
 
<EOS>
now
that
he
be
on
his
return
to
it
,
it
seem
beyond
comparison
more
dismal
and
more
dreadful
than
the
wood
.
 
<EOS>
His
hideous
secret
be
shut
up
in
the
room
,
and
all
its
terror
be
there
;
to
his
thinking
it
be
not
in
the
wood
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
He
walk
on
for
ten
mile
;
and
then
stop
at
an
ale
-
house
for
a
coach
,
which
he
know
would
pass
through
,
on
its
way
to
London
,
before
long
;
and
which
he
also
know
be
not
the
coach
he
have
travel
down
by
,
for
it
come
from
another
place
.
 
<EOS>
He
sit
down
outside
the
door
here
,
on
a
bench
,
beside
a
man
who
be
smoke
his
pipe
.
 
<EOS>
have
call
for
some
beer
,
and
drunk
,
he
offer
it
to
this
companion
,
who
thank
him
,
and
take
a
draught
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
help
think
that
,
if
the
man
have
know
all
,
he
may
scarcely
have
relish
drinking
out
of
the
same
cup
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
a
fine
night
,
master
!
<EOS>
"
say
this
person
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
a
rare
sunset
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
it
,
"
be
his
hasty
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
not
see
it
?
"
return
the
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
how
the
devil
could
I
see
it
,
if
I
be
asleep
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
asleep
!
 
<EOS>
aye
,
aye
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
man
appear
surprised
by
his
unexpected
irritability
,
and
say
no
more
,
smoke
his
pipe
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
not
sit
very
long
,
when
there
be
a
knocking
within
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
?
"
cry
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
can
not
say
,
I
be
sure
,
"
reply
the
man
.
   
<EOS>
He
make
no
further
inquiry
,
for
the
last
question
have
escape
him
in
spite
of
himself
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
think
,
at
the
moment
,
of
the
close
-
up
room
;
of
the
possibility
of
their
knocking
at
the
door
on
some
special
occasion
;
of
their
being
alarm
at
receive
no
answer
;
of
their
burst
it
open
;
of
their
find
the
room
empty
;
of
their
fasten
the
door
into
the
court
,
and
render
it
impossible
for
him
to
get
into
the
house
without
show
himself
in
the
garb
he
wear
,
which
would
lead
to
rumour
,
rumour
to
detection
,
detection
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
instant
,
as
if
by
some
design
and
order
of
circumstance
,
the
knocking
have
come
.
   
<EOS>
It
still
continue
;
like
a
warning
echo
of
the
dread
reality
he
have
conjure
up
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
could
not
sit
and
hear
it
,
he
pay
for
his
beer
and
walk
on
again
.
 
<EOS>
and
have
slunk
about
,
in
place
unknown
to
him
all
day
;
and
be
out
at
night
,
in
a
lonely
road
,
in
an
unusual
dress
and
in
that
wander
and
unsettled
frame
of
mind
;
he
stop
more
than
once
to
look
about
him
,
hope
he
may
be
in
a
dream
.
   
<EOS>
still
he
be
not
sorry
.
 
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
hate
the
man
too
much
,
and
have
be
bent
,
too
desperately
and
too
long
,
on
set
himself
free
.
<EOS>
if
the
thing
could
have
come
over
again
,
he
would
have
do
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
His
malignant
and
revengeful
passion
be
not
so
easily
lay
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
more
penitence
or
remorse
within
him
now
than
there
have
be
while
the
deed
be
brew
.
   
<EOS>
dread
and
fear
be
upon
him
,
to
an
extent
he
have
never
count
on
,
and
could
not
manage
in
the
least
degree
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
so
horribly
afraid
of
that
infernal
room
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
this
make
him
,
in
a
gloomy
murderous
,
mad
way
,
not
only
fearful
for
himself
,
but
of
himself
;
for
be
,
as
it
be
,
a
part
of
the
room
:
a
something
suppose
to
be
there
,
yet
miss
from
it
:
he
invest
himself
with
its
mysterious
terror
;
and
when
he
picture
in
his
mind
the
ugly
chamber
,
false
and
quiet
,
false
and
quiet
,
through
the
dark
hour
of
two
night
;
and
the
tumble
bed
,
and
he
not
in
it
,
though
believe
to
be
;
he
become
in
a
manner
his
own
ghost
and
phantom
,
and
be
at
once
the
haunting
spirit
and
the
haunted
man
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
coach
come
up
,
which
it
soon
do
,
he
get
a
place
outside
and
be
carry
briskly
onward
towards
home
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
in
take
his
seat
among
the
people
behind
,
who
be
chiefly
country
people
,
he
conceive
a
fear
that
they
know
of
the
murder
,
and
would
tell
him
that
the
body
have
be
find
;
which
,
consider
the
time
and
place
of
the
commission
of
the
crime
,
be
event
almost
impossible
to
have
happen
yet
,
as
he
very
well
know
.
 
<EOS>
but
although
he
do
know
it
,
and
have
therefore
no
reason
to
regard
their
ignorance
as
anything
but
the
natural
sequence
to
the
fact
,
still
this
very
ignorance
of
theirs
encourage
him
.
 
<EOS>
so
far
encourage
him
,
that
he
begin
to
believe
the
body
never
would
be
find
,
and
begin
to
speculate
on
that
probability
.
 
<EOS>
set
off
from
this
point
,
and
measure
time
by
the
rapid
hurry
of
his
guilty
thought
,
and
what
have
go
before
the
bloodshed
,
and
the
troop
of
incoherent
and
disorder
image
of
which
he
be
the
constant
prey
;
he
come
by
daylight
to
regard
the
murder
as
an
old
murder
,
and
to
think
himself
comparatively
safe
because
it
have
not
be
discover
yet
.
 
<EOS>
yet
!
<EOS>
when
the
sun
which
look
into
the
wood
,
and
gild
with
its
rise
light
a
dead
man
's
lace
,
have
see
that
man
alive
,
and
seek
to
win
him
to
a
thought
of
Heaven
,
on
its
go
down
last
night
!
   
<EOS>
but
here
be
London
street
again
.
 
<EOS>
Hush
!
   
<EOS>
It
be
but
five
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
time
enough
to
reach
his
own
house
unobserved
,
and
before
there
be
many
people
in
the
street
,
if
nothing
have
happen
so
far
,
tend
to
his
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
He
slip
down
from
the
coach
without
trouble
the
driver
to
stop
his
horse
;
and
hurry
across
the
road
,
and
in
and
out
of
every
by
-
way
that
lie
near
his
course
,
at
length
approach
his
own
dwelling
.
 
<EOS>
He
use
additional
caution
in
his

He
steal

to
the

on

,
as
if
he
dread
to
disturb
his

imaginary
rest

He
listen
.
 
<EOS>
not
a
sound

<EOS>
as
he
turn
the
key
with
a
tremble
hand
,
and
push
the
door
softly
open
with
his
knee
,
a
monstrous
fear
beset
his
mind
.
   
<EOS>
what
if
the
murdered
man

there
before

<EOS>
He

He
take
off
his

tie
it
up
in
a
bundle
ready
for
carry
away
and
sink
in
the

before

<EOS>
these
precaution
take

he
undress
and
go

<EOS>
the
rage
thirst
,
the
fire
that
burn
within
him
as
he
lie
beneath
the
clothe
,
the
augment
horror
of
the
room
when
they
shut
it
out
from
his
view
;
the
agony
of
listening
,
in
which
he
pay
enforce
regard
to
every
sound
,
and
think
the
most
unlikely
one
the
prelude
to
that
knocking
which
should
bring
the
news
;
the
start
with
which
he
leave
his
couch
,
and
look
in
the
glass
,
imagine
that
his
deed
be
broadly
write
in
his
face
,
and
lie
down
and
bury
himself
once
more
beneath
the
blanket
,
hear
his
own
heart
beat
murder
,
Murder
,
Murder
,
in
the
bed
;
what

paint
tremendous
truth
like
these
!
   
<EOS>
the
morning
advance
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
footstep
in
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
hear
the
blind
draw
up
,
and
shutter
open
;
and
now
and
then
a
stealthy
tread
outside
his
own
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
try
to
call
out
,
more
than
once
,
but
his
mouth
be
dry
as
if
it
have
be
fill
with
sand
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
sit
up
in
his
bed
,
and
cry
:
   
<EOS>
"
who
be
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
his
wife
.
   
<EOS>
He
ask
her
what
it
be
o'clock
?
 
<EOS>
nine
.
   
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
he
falter
.
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
that

<EOS>
He
have
wait
,
almost
breathless
,
for
her
answer
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
relief
to
him
,
if
anything
could
be

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Nadgett

<EOS>
He
say
it
be
of
little
consequence
,
and
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
be
open
my
window
to
let
in
the
cool
air
,
I
see
him
pass
through
the
street
this
morning
,
very
early
;
but
he
have
not
be
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
pass
through
the
street
that
morning
?
 
<EOS>
very
early
!
 
<EOS>
Jonas
tremble
at
the
thought
of
have
have
a
narrow
chance
of
see
him
himself
;
even
him
,
who
have
no
object
but
to
avoid
people
,
and
sneak
on
unobserved
,
and
keep
his
own
secret
;
and
who
see
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
He
call
to
her
to
get
his
breakfast
ready
,
and
prepare
to
go
upstairs
;
attire
himself
in
the
clothe
he
have
take
off
when
he
come
into
that
room
,
which
have
be
,
ever
since
,
outside
the
door
.
<EOS>
in
his
secret
dread
of
meet
the
household
for
the
first
time
,
after
what
he
have
do
,
he
linger
at
the
door
on
slight
pretext
that
they
may
see
him
without
look
in
his
face
;
and
leave
it
ajar
while
he
dress
;
and
call
out
to
have
the
window
open
,
and
the
pavement
water
,
that
they
may
become
accustomed
to
his
voice
.
 
<EOS>
even
when
he
have
put
off
the
time
,
by
one
mean
or
other
,
so
that
he
have
see
or
speak
to
them
all
,
he
could
not
muster
courage
for
a
long
while
to
go
in
among
them
,
but
stand
at
his
own
door
listen
to
the
murmur
of
their
distant
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
He
could
not
stop
there
for
ever
,
and
so
join
them
.
 
<EOS>
His
last
glance
at
the
glass
have
see
a
tell
-
tale
face
,
but
that
may
have
be
because
of
his
anxious
looking
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
dare
not
look
at
them
to
see
if
they
observe
him
,
but
he
think
them
very
silent
.
   
<EOS>
and
whatsoever
guard
<EOS>
he
keep
upon
himself
,
he
could
not
help
listen
,
and
show
that
he
listen

<EOS>
whether
he
attend
to
their
talk
,
or
try
to
think
of
other
thing

or
talk
himself
,
or
hold
his
peace
,
or
resolutely
count
the
dull
ticking
of
a
hoarse
clock
at
his
back
,
he
always
lapse
,
as
if
a
spell
be
on
him
,
into
eager
listening

<EOS>
for
he
know
it
must
come
.
 
<EOS>
and
his

punishment

torture

distraction

be
,
to

for
its
coming

"
how

of
those
glad
time

the
wish
that
every
one

the
summer
of

to
feel
the
beauty
of
the
summer
of

<EOS>
It

even
a
pleasanter
breakfast
than

always
a
pleasant
one

<EOS>
for
little
Ruth

,
unknown

,
have
walk
into
a
certain
shop
which
deal
in
such
article
,
after

and
have
take
courage
to
ask
the
Mistress
of
that
shop
whether
she
would
buy
them
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
mistress
have
not
only

order
more

that
very
morning
Ruth

make
confession

to
Tom
,
and
have
hand
him
the
money
in
a
little
purse

have
work
expressly
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
be
in
a
flutter
about
this

perhaps
have
shed
a
happy
tear
or
two
for
anything
the
history

the
contrary
;

it
be
all
over

I
do
not
believe

get
me
into
that
unsatisfactory
scrape

a

short
double
knock

out
into

away
to
John

by

exact
to
his

<EOS>
John
Westlock
be
at
home
,
but
,
strange
to
say
,
be
rather
embarrassed
to
see
them
;
and
when
Tom
be
about
to
go
into
the
room
where
he
be
breakfast
,
say
he
have
a
stranger
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
appear
to
be
a
mysterious
stranger
,
for
John
shut
that
door
as
he
say
it
,
and
lead
them
into
the
next
room
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
very
much
delighted
,
though
,
to
see
Mark
Tapley
;
and
receive
Martin
with
his
own
frank
courtesy
.
 
<EOS>
but
Martin
feel
that
he
do
not
inspire
John
Westlock
with
any
unusual
interest
;
and
twice
or
thrice
observe
that
he
look
at
Tom
Pinch
doubtfully
;
not
to
say
compassionately
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
,
and
blush
to
think
,
that
he
know
the
cause
of
this

"
I
apprehend
you

engage

when

have
announce
the

<EOS>
"
I
am
engaged

John

with
some
reluctance
;

but
the
matter
on

I
be
engage

one

plainly

little
hesitation

"
why
,
I
be

so

be
aware

reason
to
prevent
my
doing
so
now

than
the
request

It

Tom

with
an
uneasy
sense

in
the
negative

Martin

express
himself
perfectly
satisfied

beg
them
not
to

another
word
;
though
he
could
not

wonder
very
much
what
curious
office
Tom
hold

why
he
be
so
secret

embarrassed

You

Mr

You

My

<EOS>
Wery
good
,

<EOS>
in

state
of

I
get
a
notion
in

with
what
you

We

"
well
,
sir

<EOS>
but
bein
'
at

full
of

I
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
no

out
of
such
a
way
of

that
,
where
everything

Lookin

of

in

I
may

I

Mr

we

see
with

you

me
likely

on

consider

do

treat

it

It
be
much
easy

<EOS>
this
be
not

warmly
,

be
energetically
speak
too

there
be
no

one

the

feel
so
strongly

I
grow
into

the

tack
on
to
the
skirt

that
narrative
<EOS>
Tom

own
account

business
on

Martin
be
not

puzzled

to
an
end

seem

leave
Martin
to
himself

considerable
astonishment

soon
come
back
again
to
fulfil
his
promise

accompany
him
into

find
there
a
third
person
;
no

the
stranger
of
whom
his
host
have
speak
when
Tom

introduce
him

He
be
a
young
man

with
deep
black
hair

eye

<EOS>
He
be
gaunt

pale
;
and
evidently
have
not
long
recover
from
a
severe
illness

<EOS>
He
stand
as
Martin
enter
,

sit
again
at
John
's
desire

<EOS>
His
eye
be
cast
downward
;
and
but
for
one
glance
at
them
both
,
half
in
humiliation
and
half
in
entreaty
,
he
keep
them
so
,

sit
quite
still

silent
.
   
<EOS>
"
this

not
move
or

a
pause

not

glad

hear
it

the
short
statement
that
I
wish
you
to
hear
from

Mr
Chuzzlewit

pursue
---
look
attentively
at
him

not
at
Martin

he
make
to
me
for
the
first
time
yesterday

repeat
to
me
this
morning
,
without
the
least
variation
of
any
essential
particular
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
already
tell
you
that
he
inform
me
before
he
be
remove
from

Inn

that
he
have
a
secret
to
disclose
to
me
which
lie
heavy
on
his
mind

<EOS>
but
,
fluctuate
between
sickness
and
health
and
between
his
desire
to
relieve
himself
of
it

his
dread
of
involve
himself
by
reveal
it

he
have
,
until

of
my
right

a
letter

it
relate
to
a

think

it
may
throw
some
light
on
that
little
mystery
which
make
Tom
anxious
now

then
;
I
urge
the
point
upon
him
,

hear
his
statement
,
as
you
will
now

from
his
own
lip

It
be
due

him
to
say

that
in

apprehension

death
,
he
commit
it

write
sometime
since

fold
it

to
know
it
;
for
I
have
often
hear
him
wish
his
old
father
dead
,
and
complain
of
his
be
wearisome
to
him
,
and
a
drag
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
in
the
habit
of
do
so
,
at
a
place
of
meeting
we
have
---
three
or
four
of
us
---
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
good
in
the
place
you
may
suppose
,
when
you
hear
that
he
be
the
chief
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
die
myself
,
and
never
see
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
stop
again
;
and
again
resume
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
meet
to
drink
and
game
;
not
for
large
sum
,
but
for
sum
that
be
large
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
He
generally
win
.
 
<EOS>
whether
or
no
,
he
lend
money
at
interest
to
those
who
lose
;
and
in
this
way
,
though
I
think
we
all
secretly
hate
him
,
he
come
to
be
the
master
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
to
propitiate
him
we
make
a
jest
of
his
father
;
it
begin
with
his
debtor
;
I
be
one
;
and
we
use
to
toast
a
quick
journey
to
the
old
man
,
and
a
swift
inheritance
to
the
young
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
pause
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
one
night
he
come
there
in
a
very
bad
humour
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
greatly
try
,
he
say
,
by
the
old
man
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
I
be
alone
together
;
and
he
angrily
tell
me
,
that
the
old
man
be
in
his
second
childhood
;
that
he
be
weak
,
imbecile
,
and
drivel
;
as
unbearable
to
himself
as
he
be
to
other
people
;
and
that
it
would
be
a
charity
to
put
him
out
of
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
swear
that
he
have
often
think
of
mix
something
with
the
stuff
he
take
for
his
cough
,
which
should
help
him
to
die
easily
.
 
<EOS>
People
be
sometimes
smother
who
be
bite
by
mad
dog
,
he
say
;
and
why
not
help
these
linger
old
man
out
of
their
trouble
too
?
 
<EOS>
He
look
full
at
me
as
he
say
so
,
and
I
look
full
at
him
;
but
it
go
no
farther
that
night
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
stop
once
more
,
and
be
silent
for
so
long
an
interval
that
John
Westlock
say
"
go
on
.
"
 
<EOS>
Martin
have
never
remove
his
eye
from
his
face
,
but
be
so
absorb
in
horror
and
astonishment
that
he
could
not
speak
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
may
have
be
a
week
after
that
,
or
it
may
have
be
less
or
more
---
the
matter
be
in
my
mind
all
the
time
,
but
I
can
not
recollect
the
time
,
as
I
should
any
other
period
---
when
he
speak
to
me
again
.
<EOS>
We
be
alone
then
,
too
;
be
there
before
the
usual
hour
of
assemble
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
appointment
between
us
;
but
I
think
I
go
there
to
meet
him
,
and
I
know
he
come
there
to
meet
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
there
first
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
read
a
newspaper
when
I
go
in
,
and
nod
to
me
without
look
up
,
or
leave
off
reading
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
down
opposite
and
close
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
immediately
,
that
he
want
me
to
get
him
some
of
two
sort
of
drug
.
 
<EOS>
one
that
be
instantaneous
in
its
effect
;
of
which
he
want
very
little
.
 
<EOS>
one
that
be
slow
and
not
suspicious
in
appearance
;
of
which
he
want
more
.
 
<EOS>
while
he
be
speak
to
me
he
still
read
the
newspaper
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
"
drug
,
"
and
never
use
any
other
word
.
 
<EOS>
neither
do
I.
"
   
<EOS>
"
this
all
agree
with
what
I
have
hear
before
,
"
observe
John
Westlock
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ask
him
what
he
want
the
drug
for
?
 
<EOS>
He
say
for
no
harm
;
to
physic
cat
;
what
do
it
matter
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
out
to
a
distant
colony
<EOS>
(
I
have
recently
get
the
appointment
,
which
,
as
Mr
Westlock
know
,
I
have
since
lose
by
my
sickness
,
and
which
be
my
only
hope
of
salvation
from
ruin
)
,
and
what
do
it
matter
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
He
could
get
them
without
my
aid
at
half
a
hundred
place
,
but
not
so
easily
as
he
could
get
them
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
true
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
not
want
them
at
all
,
he
say
,
and
he
have
no
present
idea
of
use
them
;
but
he
wish
to
have
them
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
time
he
still
read
the
newspaper
.
 
<EOS>
We
talk
about
the
price
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
to
forgive
me
a
small
debt
<EOS>
---
I
be
quite
in
his
power
---
and
to
pay
me
five
pound
;
and
there
the
matter
drop
,
through
other
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
next
night
,
under
exactly
similar
circumstance
,
I
give
him
the
drug
,
on
his
saying
<EOS>
I
be
a
fool
to
think
that
he
should
ever
use
them
for
any
harm
;
and
he
give
me
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
never
meet
since
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
know
that
the
poor
old
father
die
soon
afterwards
,
just
as
he
would
have
die
from
this
cause
;
and
that
I
have
undergo
,
and
suffer
now
,
intolerable
misery
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
<EOS>
"
he
add
,
stretch
out
his
hand

"
can
paint
my
misery
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
well
deserved
,
but
nothing
can
paint
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
with
that
he
hang
his
head
,
and
say
no
more
,
waste
and
wretched
,
he
be
not
a
creature
upon
whom
to
heap
reproach
that
be
unavaile
.
   
<EOS>
"
let
him
remain
at
hand
,
"
say
Martin
,
turn
from
him
;
"
but
out
of
sight
,
in
Heaven
's
name
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
will
remain
here
,
"
John
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
with
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
softly
turn
the
key
upon
him
as
they
go
out
,
he
conduct
Martin
into
the
adjoining
room
,
in
which
they
have
be
before
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
be
so
amazed
,
so
shocked
,
and
confound
by
what
he
have
hear
that
it
be
some
time
before
he
could
reduce
it
to
any
order
in
his
mind
,
or
could
sufficiently
comprehend
the
bearing
of
one
part
upon
another
,
to
take
in
all
the
detail
at
one
view
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
,
at
length
,
have
the
whole
narrative
clearly
before
him
,
John
Westlock
go
on
to
point
out
the
great
probability
of
the
guilt
of
Jonas
be
know
to
other
people
,
who
trade
in
it
for
their
own
benefit
,
and
who
be
,
by
such
mean
,
able
to
exert
that
control
over
him
which
Tom
Pinch
have
accidentally
witness
,
and
unconsciously
assist
.
 
<EOS>
this
appear
so
plain
,
that
they
agree
upon
it
without
difficulty
;
but
instead
of
derive
the
least
assistance
from
this
source
,
they
find
that
it
embarrass
them
the
more
.
   
<EOS>
They
know
nothing
of
the
real
party
who
possess
this
power
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
person
before
them
be
Tom
's
landlord
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
no
right
to
question
Tom
's
landlord
,
even
if
they
could
find
him
,
which
,
accord
to
Tom
's
account
,
it
would
not
be
easy
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
and
grant
that
they
do
question
him
,
and
he
answer
(
which
be
take
a
good
deal
for
grant
)
,
he
have
only
to
say
,
with
reference
to
the
adventure
on
the
wharf
,
that
he
have
be
send
from
such
and
such
a
place
to
summon
Jonas
back
on
urgent
business
,
and
there
be
an
end
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
besides
,
there
be
the
great
difficulty
and
responsibility
of
move
at
all
in
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Lewsome
's
story
may
be
false
;
in
his
wretched
state
it
may
be
greatly
heighten
by
a
disease
brain
;
or
admit
it
to
be
entirely
true
,
the
old
man
may
have
die
a
natural
death
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
have
be
there
at
the
time
;
as
Tom
immediately
remember
,
when
he
come
back
in
the
afternoon
,
and
share
their
counsel
;
and
there
have
be
no
secrecy
about
it
.
<EOS>
Martin
's
grandfather
be
of
right
the
person
to
decide
upon
the
course
that
should
be
take
;
but
to
get
at
his
view
would
be
impossible
,
for
Mr
Pecksniff
's
view
be
certain
to
be
his
.
<EOS>
and
the
nature
of
Mr
Pecksniff
's
view
in
reference
to
his
own
son
-
in
-
law
may
be
easily
reckon
upon
.
   
<EOS>
apart
from
these
consideration
,
Martin
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
seem
to
grasp
at
this
unnatural
charge
against
his
relative
,
and
use
it
as
a
stepping
-
stone
to
his
grandfather
's
favour
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
he
would
seem
to
do
so
,
if
he
present
himself
before
his
grandfather
in
Mr
Pecksniff
's
house
again
,
for
the
purpose
of
declare
it
;
and
that
Mr
Pecksniff
,
of
all
man
,
would
represent
his
conduct
in
that
despicable
light
,
he
perfectly
well
know
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
to
be
in
possession
of
such
a
statement
,
and
take
no
measure
of
further
inquiry
in
reference
to
it
,
be
tantamount
to
be
a
partner
in
the
guilt
it
profess
to
disclose
.
   
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
they
be
wholly
unable
to
discover
any
outlet
from
this
maze
of
difficulty
,
which
do
not
lie
through
some
perplex
and
entangle
thicket
.
 
<EOS>
and
although
Mr
Tapley
be
promptly
take
into
their
confidence
;
and
the
fertile
imagination
of
that
gentleman
suggest
many
bold
expedient
,
which
,
to
do
him
justice
,
he
be
quite
ready
to
carry
into
instant
operation
on
his
own
personal
responsibility
;
still
"
bate
the
general
zeal
of
Mr
Tapley
's
nature
,
nothing
be
make
particularly
clear
by
these
offer
of
service
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
in
this
position
of
affair
that
Tom
's
account
of
the
strange
behaviour
of
the
decay
clerk
,
on
the
night
of
the
tea
-
party
,
become
of
great
moment
,
and
finally
convince
them
that
to
arrive
at
a
more
accurate
knowledge
of
the
working
of
that
old
man
's
mind
and
memory
,
would
be
to
take
a
most
important
stride
in
their
pursuit
of
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
have
first
satisfy
themselves
that
no
communication
have
ever
take
place
between
Lewsome
and
Mr
Chuffey
(
which
would
have
account
at
once
for
any
suspicion
the
latter
may
entertain
)
,
they
unanimously
resolve
that
the
old
clerk
be
the
man
they
want
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
like
the
unanimous
resolution
of
a
public
meeting
,
which
will
oftentimes
declare
that
this
or
that
grievance
be
not
to
be
bear
a
moment
longer
,
which
be
nevertheless
bear
for
a
century
or
two
afterwards
,
without
any
modification
,
they
only
reach
in
this
the
conclusion
that
they
be
all
of
one
mind
.
 
<EOS>
for
it
be
one
thing
to
want
Mr
Chuffey
,
and
another
thing
to
get
at
him
;
and
to
do
that
without
alarm
him
,
or
without
alarm
Jonas
,
or
without
be
discomfit
by
the
difficulty
of
strike
,
in
an
instrument
so
out
of
tune
and
so
unused
,
the
note
they
seek
,
be
an
end
as
far
from
their
reach
as
ever
.
   
<EOS>
the
question
then
become
,
who
of
those
about
the
old
clerk
have
have
most
influence
with
him
that
night
?
 
<EOS>
Tom
say
his
young
mistress
clearly
.
 
<EOS>
but
Tom
and
all
of
them
shrink
from
the
thought
of
entrap
her
,
and
make
her
the
innocent
mean
of
bring
retribution
on
her
cruel
husband
.
 
<EOS>
be
there
nobody
else
?
 
<EOS>
why
yes
.
<EOS>
in
a
very
different
way
,
Tom
say
,
he
be
influence
by
Mrs
Gamp
,
the
nurse
;
who
have
once
have
the
control
of
him
,
as
he
understand
,
for
some
time
.
   
<EOS>
They
catch
at
this
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
a
new
way
out
,
develop
in
a
quarter
until
then
overlook
.
 
<EOS>
John
Westlock
know
Mrs
Gamp
;
he
have
give
her
employment
;
he
be
acquaint
with
her
place
of
residence
:
for
that
good
lady
have
obligingly
furnish
him
,
at
parting
,
with
a
pack
of
her
professional
card
for
general
distribution
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
decide
that
Mrs
Gamp
should
be
approach
with
caution
,
but
approach
without
delay
;
and
that
the
depth
of
that
discreet
matron
's
knowledge
of
Mr
Chuffey
,
and
mean
of
bring
them
,
or
one
of
them
,
into
communication
with
him
,
should
be
carefully
sound
.
   
<EOS>
on
this
service
,
Martin
and
John
Westlock
determine
to
proceed
that
night
;
wait
on
Mrs
Gamp
first
,
at
her
lodging
;
and
take
their
chance
of
find
her
in
the
repose
of
private
life
,
or
of
have
to
seek
her
out
,
elsewhere
,
in
the
exercise
of
her
professional
duty
.
<EOS>
Tom
return
home
,
that
he
may
lose
no
opportunity
of
have
an
interview
with
Nadgett
,
by
be
absent
in
the
event
of
his
reappearance
.
 
<EOS>
and
Mr
Tapley
remain
(
by
his
own
particular
desire
)
for
the
time
be
in
Furnival
's
Inn
,
to
look
after
Lewsome
;
who
may
safely
have
be
leave
to
himself
,
however
,
for
any
thought
he
seem
to
entertain
of
give
them
the
slip
.
   
<EOS>
before
they
part
on
their
several
errand
,
they
cause
him
to
read
aloud
,
in
the
presence
of
them
all
,
the
paper
which
he
have
about
him
,
and
the
declaration
he
have
attach
to
it
,
which
be
to
the
effect
that
he
have
write
it
voluntarily
,
in
the
fear
of
death
and
in
the
torture
of
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
he
have
do
so
,
they
all
sign
it
,
and
take
it
from
him
,
of
his
free
will
,
lock
it
in
a
place
of
safety
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
also
write
,
by
John
's
advice
,
a
letter
to
the
trustee
of
the
famous
Grammar
School
,
boldly
claim
the
successful
design
as
his
,
and
charge
Mr
Pecksniff
with
the
fraud
he
have
commit
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
proceeding
also
,
John
be
hotly
interested
;
observe
,
with
his
usual
irreverance
,
that
Mr
Pecksniff
have
be
a
successful
rascal
all
his
life
through
,
and
that
it
would
be
a
last
source
of

They

in

<EOS>
Sarah
Gamp
look
at
her
with
an
eye
of
fire

for
she
see
in
this
mistake
of
Mrs

,
another
willful
and
malignant
stab
at
that
same
weakness
or
custom
of
her
,
an
ungenerous
allusion
to
which
,
on
the
part
of
Betsey
,
have
first
disturb
their
harmony
that
evening

<EOS>
and
she
see
it
still
more
clearly
,
when
,
politely

firmly
correct
that
lady
by
the
distinct
enunciation
of
the
word
"
Chuffey
,
"
Mrs

receive
the
correction
with
a
diabolical
laugh
.
   
<EOS>
the
good
among
us
have
their
failing
,
and
it
must
be
concede
of
Mrs
Prig
,
that
if
there
be
a
blemish
in
the
goodness
of
her
disposition
,
it
be
a
habit
she
have
of
not
bestow
all
its
sharp
and
acid
property
upon
her
patient
(
as
a
thoroughly
amiable
woman
would
have
do
)
,
but
of
keep
a
considerable
remainder
for
the
service
of
her
friend
.
 
<EOS>
highly
pickle
salmon
,
and
lettuce
chop
up
in
vinegar
,
may
,
as
viand
possess
some
acidity
of
their
own
,
have
encourage
and
increase
this
failing
in
Mrs
Prig
;
and
every
application
to
the
teapot
certainly
do
;
for
it
be
often
remark
of
her
by
her
friend
,
that
she
be
most
contradictory
when
most
elevated
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
certain
that
her
countenance
become
about
this
time
derisive
and
defiant
,
and
that
she
sit
with
her
arm
fold
,
and
one
eye
shut
up
,
in
a
somewhat
offensive
,
because
obstrusively
intelligent
,
manner
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
observe
this
,
feel
it
the
more
necessary
that
Mrs
Prig
should
know
her
place
,
and
be
make
sensible
of
her
exact
station
in
society
,
as
well
as
of
her
obligation
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
She
therefore
assume
an
air
of
great
patronage
and
importance
,
as
she
go
on
to
answer
Mrs
Prig
a
little
more
in
detail
.
   
<EOS>
"

"
oh

<EOS>
the
severely
ironical
character
of
this
reply
be
strengthen
by
a
very
slow
nod
,
and
a
still
slow
draw
down
of
the
corner
of
Mrs

extreme

delusion
of
the

her
with
the

they
want

a
shrewd
avoidance

she

Mrs

rise
;
and
put
away
the

in
its

place

and
lock
the
cupboard

much

to
attire
herself
for
a
professional

<EOS>
this
preparation
be
easily
make
,
as
it
require
nothing
more
than
the
snuffy
black
bonnet
,
the
snuffy
black
shawl
,
the
patten
and
the
indispensable
umbrella

without
which
neither

could
by
any

acuteness

commiseration

break
at
interval

slumber
of
Friar
Bacon

by
the
dropping

It

Tom

together
before
tea

talk
,
in

about
a

not
at
all
about
Lewsome

for
John

really
John
,
for
so
young
a
man
,
be
one
of
the
most
considerate
fellow
in
the

have
particularly
advise
Tom
not
to
mention
it
to
his

just
yet
,
in
case
it
should
disquiet
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
I
would
not
,
Tom
,
"
he
say
,
with
a
little
hesitation
,
"
I
would
not
have
a
shadow
on
her
happy
face

an
uneasy
thought

gentle
heart
,
for
all
the
wealth

honour
of
the

"
 
<EOS>
really
John
be
uncommonly
kind
;
extraordinarily
kind
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
be
her
father
,
Tom
say
,
he
could
not
have
take
a
great
interest
in
her
.
   
<EOS>
but
although
Tom
and
his
sister
be
extremely
conversational
,
they
be
less
lively
,
and
less
cheerful
,
than
usual
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
have
no
idea
that
this
originate
with
Ruth
,
but
take
it
for
grant
that
he
be
rather
dull
himself
.
 
<EOS>
in
truth
he
be
;
for
the
light
cloud
upon
the
Heaven
of
her
quiet
mind
,
cast
its
shadow
upon
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
and
there
be
a
cloud
on
little
Ruth
that
evening
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
when
Tom
be
look
in
another
direction
,
her
bright
eye
,
steal
on
towards
his
face
,
would
sparkle
still
more
brightly
than
their
custom
be
,
and
then
grow
dim
.
 
<EOS>
when
Tom
be
silent
,
look
out
upon
the
summer
weather
,
she
would
sometimes
make
a
hasty
movement
,
as
if
she
be
about
to
throw
herself
upon
his
neck
;
then
check
the
impulse
,
and
when
he
look
round
,
show
a
laughing
face
,
and
speak
to
him
very
merrily
;
when
she
have
anything
to
give
Tom
,
or
have
any
excuse
for
come
near
him
,
she
would
flutter
about
him
,
and
lie
her
bashful
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
not
be
willing
to
withdraw
it
;
and
would
show
by
all
such
mean
that
there
be
something
on
her
heart
which
in
her
great
love
she
long
to
say
to
him
,
but
have
not
the
courage
to
utter
.
   
<EOS>
so
they
be
sit
,
<EOS>
she
with
her
work
before
her
,
but
not
work
,
and
Tom
with
his
book
beside
him

not
read
,
when
Martin
knock
at
the
door

anticipate
who
it
be

Tom
go
to
open
it
;
and
he
and
Martin
come
back
into
the
room
together
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
look
surprised
,
for
in
answer
to
his
cordial
greeting
<EOS>
Martin
have
hardly
speak
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
Ruth
also
see
that
there
be
something
strange
in
the
manner
of
their
visitor
,
and
raise
her
eye
inquiringly
to
Tom
's
face
,
as
if
she
be
seek
an
explanation
there
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
shake
his
head
,
and
make
the

mute
appeal
to
Martin

Martin
do
not

down

walk
up
to
the
window

stand
there

out

He
turn
round
after

hastily
avert

without

Tom

reply
Martin
,
in
a
tone
of
deep
reproach

<EOS>
"
to
hear
you
feign
that
interest

me
even
more

me
to

fervently

His

be

have

such
high
past
love

so
much
sorrow

compassion

Tom

for
a
moment

put
his
hand
before
his
face

have
no
more
power

justify
himself

for
that

perhaps

I
should
blame
my

wealth

worth
have

be
free

make
your

you
make
it

the
choice
be
not
difficult

those
who
have
not
the
courage
to
resist
such
temptation
,
should
have
the
courage
to
avow
what
they
have
yield
to
them
;

I
do
blame
you
for
this
,
Tom

that
you
receive
me
with
a
show

warmth

encourage
me

be
frank

plain

spoken

tempt
me

He
take
his

aloud

turn
a
leaf

down

make
a
motion
with
his
hand
as
if

would
have
put
his
sister
hurriedly
away
;

it
clasp
upon
hers
,
and
all
his
little
history
be
write
in
the
action

its

silent
touch

you

faithful

good

true

deny

struggle
with

so
gentle

kind

temper

that
I

never

you

one
irritable
word

you

cruelly
mistaken

Tom

dear
Tom

will
this
be
set
right

Will
it
,
Tom

Will
you
always
have
this
sorrow
in
your
breast

you
who
deserve
to
be
so
happy

be
there
any
hope

"
   
<EOS>
and
still
she
hide
her
face
from
Tom
,
and
clasp
him
round
the
neck
,
and
weep
for
him
,
and
pour
out
all
her
woman
's
heart
and
soul
in
the
relief
and
pain
of
this
disclosure

<EOS>
It
be
not
very
long
before
she
and
Tom
be
sit
side
by
side
,
and
she
be
look
with
an
earnest
quietness
in
Tom
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
then
Tom
speak
to
her
thus
,
cheerily
,
though
gravely
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
,
my
dear
,
that
this
have
pass
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
not
because
it
assure
me
of
your
tender
affection
(
for
I
be
well
assure
of
that
before
)
,
but
because
it
relieve
my
mind
of
a
great
weight
.

"
   
<EOS>
Tom
's
eye
glisten
when
he
speak
of
her
affection
;
and
he
kiss
her
on
the
cheek
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
girl
,
"
say
Tom
;
"
with
whatever
feeling
I
regard
her
"
---
they
seem
to
avoid
the
name
by
mutual
consent
---
"
I
have
long
ago
---
I
be
sure
I
may
say
from
the
very
first
---
look
upon
it
as
a
dream
.
 
<EOS>
as
something
that
may
possibly
have
happen
under
very
different
circumstance
,
but
which
can
never
be
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
what
would
you
have
set
right
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
give
Tom
such
a
significant
little
look
,
that
he
be
oblige
to
take
it
for
an
answer
whether
he
would
or
no
;
and
to
go
on
.
   
<EOS>
"
by
her
own
choice
and
free
consent
,
my
love
,
she
be
betroth
to
Martin
;
and
be
,
long
before
either
of
them
know
of
my
existence
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
her
betroth
to
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
she
say
directly
.
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
rejoin
Tom
,
"
but
that
may
be
set
it
wrong
,
instead
of
right
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
think
,
"
say
Tom
,
with
a
grave
smile
,
"
that
even
if
she
have
never
see
him
,
it
be
very
likely
she
would
have
fall
in
love
with
Me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
not
,
dear
Tom
?
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
shake
his
head
,
and
smile
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
think
of
me
,
Ruth
,
"
say
Tom
,
"
and
it
be
very
natural
that
you
should
,
as
if
I
be
a
character
in
a
book
;
and
you
make
it
a
sort
of
poetical
justice
that
I
should
,
by
some
impossible
mean
or
other
,
come
,
at
last
,
to
marry
the
person
I
love
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
much
high
justice
than
poetical
justice
,
my
dear
,
and
it
do
not
order
event
upon
the
same
principle
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
people
who
read
about
hero
in
book
,
and
choose
to
make
hero
of
themselves
out
of
book
,
consider
it
a
very
fine
thing
to
be
discontent
and
gloomy
,
and
misanthropical
,
and
perhaps
a
little
blasphemous
,
because
they
can
not
have
everything
order
for
their
individual
accommodation
.
 
<EOS>
Would
you
like
me
to
become
one
of
that
sort
of
people
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
but
still
I
know
,
"
she
add
timidly
,
"
that
this
be
a
sorrow
to
you
in
your
own
well
way
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
think
of
dispute
the
position
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
would
have
be
mere
folly
,
and
he
give
it
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
say
Tom
,
"
I
will
repay
your
affection
with
the
truth
and
all
the
Truth

<EOS>
It
be
a
sorrow
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
prove
it
to
be
<EOS>
so
sometimes
,
though
I
have
always
strive
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
somebody
who
be
precious
to
you
may
die
,
and
you
may
dream
that
you
be
in
heaven
with
the
depart
spirit
,
and
you
may
find
it
a
sorrow
to
wake
to
the
life
on
earth
,
which
be
no
hard
to
be
bear
than
when
you
fall
asleep

<EOS>
It
be
sorrowful
to
me
to
contemplate
my
dream
which
I
always
know
be
a
dream
,
even
when
it
first
present
itself
;

the
reality
about
me
be
not
to
blame

They
be
the

as
they
be

<EOS>
My
sister

my
sweet
companion

who
make
this
place
<EOS>
so
dear

she
less
devoted
to
me

Ruth

than
she
would
have
be
,
if
this
vision
have
never
trouble
me

My
old
friend
John

who
may
so
easily
have
treat
me
with
coldness

neglect

be
he
less
cordial
to
me

the
world
about
me

be
there
less
good

be
my
word
to
be
harsh
and
my
look
to
be
sour

be
my

grow
cold

fall
in

remember
all

hardly

call
this
lurk

with
a
glow

pride

that
(
which

They
have
never

such
a
pleasant
walk
as
they
take
that
night

<EOS>
Tom
tell
her
all
so
freely

so
simply
,

be
so
desirous
to
return
her
tenderness
with
his
full
confidence

that
they
prolong
it
far
beyond
their
usual
hour

sit
up
late
when
they
come
home

and
when
they
part
for
the
night
there
be
such
a
tranquil
,
beautiful
expression
in
Tom
's
face
,
that
she
could
not
bear
to
shut
it
out
,

go
back
on
tiptoe
to
his
chamber

door

look
in

stand
there

he
see
her

embrace
him
again

withdraw

in

prayer

sleep

good
time

his

uppermost

when
he
be
leave
alone

Tom
ponder
very
much
on
this
discovery
of
her
,

greatly
wonder
what
have
lead
her
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
because
,
"
think
Tom
,
"
I
have
be
so
very
careful

It
be
foolish

unnecessary
in
me

as
I
clearly
see
now
,
when
I
be
so
relieved
by
her
know
it
;

I
have
be
so
very
careful
to
conceal
it
from
her
.

of
course
I
know
that
she
be
intelligent

quick

be
more
upon

I
be
not

prepared

this

I
be
sure
her
discovery
have
be
sudden
too

It
be
a

singular
instance

Tom
could
not

it
out

there
it

how

recall
all
the
little
incident

how
her
face
flush

that
be
natural

oh

quite
natural

<EOS>
that

no

Tom
little
think

Tom
little
know

there
be
that
in
Ruth

own
heart

newly
set
there

have
help
her
to
the
reading
of
his
mystery

ah

He
do
not

pass
it
every

who
so
lively

cheerful
as
busy
Ruth
next
morning

<EOS>
Her
early
tap
at
Tom

her
light
foot
outside

have
be
music

him

but
she
say
it
be
the
bright
morning
ever
see
;
and
so
it
be
;
<EOS>
and
if
it
have
be
otherwise
,
she
would
have
make
it
so
to
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
She
be
ready
with
his
neat
breakfast
when
he
go
downstairs
,
and
have
her
bonnet
ready
for
the
early
walk
,
and
be
so
full
of
news
,
that
Tom
be
lose
in
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
She
may
have
be
up
all
night
,
collect
it
for
his
entertainment
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
Mr
Nadgett
not
come
home
yet
,
and
there
be
bread
down
a
penny
a
loaf
,
and
there
be
twice
as
much
strength
in
this
tea
as
in
the
last
,
and
the
milk
-
woman
's
husband
have
come
out
of
the
hospital
cure
,
and
the
curly
-
head
child
over
the
way
have
be

,
and
she
be
go
to
make
all
sort
of
preserve
in
a
desperate
hurry
,
and
there
happen
to
be
a
saucepan
in
the
house
which
be
the
very
saucepan
for
the
purpose
;
and
she
know
all
about
the
last
book
Tom
have
bring
home
,
all
through
,
though
it
be
a
teaser
to
read
;
and
she
have
so
much
to
tell
him
that
she
have
finish
breakfast
first
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
have
her
little
bonnet
on
,
and
the
tea
and
sugar
lock
up
,
and
the
key
in
her
reticule
,
and
the
flower
,
as
usual
,
in
Tom
's
coat
,
and
be
in
all
respect
quite
ready
to
accompany
him
,
before
Tom
know
she
have
begin
to
prepare
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
short
,
as
Tom
say
,
with
a
confidence
in
his
own
assertion
which
amount
to
a
defiance
of
the
public
in
general
,
there
never
be
such
a
little
woman
.
   
<EOS>
She
make
Tom
talkative
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
resist
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
put
such
enticing
question
to
him
;
about
book
,
and
about
date
of
church
,
and
about
organ
and
about
the
Temple
,
and
about
all
kind
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
lighten
the
way
(
and
Tom
's
heart
with
it
)
to
that
degree
,
that
the
Temple
look
quite
blank
and
solitary
when
he
part
from
her
at
the
gate
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
Mr
Fips
's
friend
to
-
day
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
"
think
Tom
,
as
he
ascend
the
stair
.
   
<EOS>
not
yet
,
at
any
rate
,
for
the
door
be
close
as
usual
,
and
Tom
open
it
with
his
key
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
get
the
book
into
perfect
order
now
,
and
have
mend
the
torn
leave
,
and
have
paste
up
the
broken
back
,
and
substitute
neat
label
for
the
wear
-
out
lettering
.
 
<EOS>
It
look
a
different
place
,
it
be
so
orderly
and
neat
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
feel
some
pride
in
comtemplate
the
change
he
have
work
,
though
there
be
no
one
to
approve
or
disapprove
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
at
present
occupy
in
make
a
fair
copy
of
his
draught
of
the
catalogue
;
on
which
,
as
there
be
no
hurry
,
he
be
painfully
concentrate
all
the
ingenious
and
laborious
neatness
he
have
ever
expend
on
map
or
plan
in
Mr
Pecksniff
's
workroom
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
marvel
of
a
catalogue
;
for
Tom
sometimes
think
he
be
really
get
his
money
too
easily
,
and
he
have
determine
within
himself
that
this
document
should
take
a
little
of
his
superfluous
leisure
out
of
him
.
   
<EOS>
so
with
pen
and
ruler
,
and
compass
and
india
-
rubber
,
and
pencil
,
and
black
ink
,
and
red
ink
,
Tom
work
away
all
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
a
good
deal
about
Martin
,
and
their
interview
of
yesterday
,
and
would
have
be
far
easy
in
his
mind
if
he
could
have
resolve
to
confide
it
to
his
friend
John
,
and
to
have
take
his
opinion
on
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
but
besides
that
he
know
what
John
's
boiling
indignation
would
be
,
he
bethink
himself
that
he
be
help
Martin
now
in
a
matter
of
great
moment
,
and
that
to
deprive
the
latter
of
his
assistance
at
such
a
crisis
of
affair
,
would
be
to
inflict
a
serious
injury
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
I
will
keep
it
to
myself
,
"
say
Tom
,
with
a
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
keep
it
to
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
and
to
work
he
go
again
,
more
assiduously
than
ever
,
with
the
pen
,
and
the
ruler
,
and
the
india
-
rubber
,
and
the
pencil
,
and
the
red
ink
,
that
he
may
forget
it
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
labour
away
another
hour
or
more
,
when
he
hear
a
footstep
in
the
entry
,
down
below
.
   
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
"
say
Tom
,
look
towards
the
door
;
"
time
be
,
not
long
ago
either
,
when
that
would
have
set
me
wonder
and
expect
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
leave
off
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
the
footstep
come
on
,
up
the
stair
.
   
<EOS>
"
thirty
-
six
,
thirty
-
seven
,
thirty
-
eight

"
say
Tom
,
counting
.
 
<EOS>
"
now
you
will
stop
.
 
<EOS>
nobody
ever
come
past
the
thirty
-
eighth
stair
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
person
do
,
certainly
,
but
only
to
take
breath
;
for
up
the
footstep
come
again
.
 
<EOS>
forty
,
forty
-
one
,
forty
-
two
,
and
so
on
.
   
<EOS>
the
door
stand
open
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
tread
advance
,
Tom
look
impatiently
and
eagerly
towards
it
.
 
<EOS>
when
a
figure
come
upon
the
landing
,
and
arrive
in
the
doorway
,
stop
and
gaze
at
him
,
he
rise
up
from
his
chair
,
and
half
believe
he
see
a
spirit
.
   
<EOS>
Old
Martin
Chuzzlewit
!
 
<EOS>
the
same
whom
he
have
leave
at
Mr
Pecksniff
's
,
weak
and
sinking
!
   
<EOS>
the
same
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
not
the
same
,
for
this
old
man
,
though
old
,
be
strong
,
and
lean
upon
his
stick
with
a
vigorous
hand
,
while
with
the
other
he
sign
to
Tom
to
make
no
noise
.
 
<EOS>
one
glance
at
the
resolute
face
,
the
watchful
eye
,
the
vigorous
hand
upon
the
staff
,
the
triumphant
purpose
in
the
figure
,
and
such
a
light
break
in
on
Tom
as
blind
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
expect
me
,
"
say
Martin
,
"
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
tell
that
my
employer
would
arrive
soon
,
"
say
Tom
;
"
<EOS>
but
---
"
   
"
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
ignorant
who
he
be

<EOS>
It
be
my
desire

<EOS>
I
be
glad
it
have
be
so
well
observe

<EOS>
I
intend
to
have
be
with
you
much
sooner

<EOS>
I
think
the
time
have
come

<EOS>
I
think
I
could
know
no
more
,
and
no
bad
,
of
him
,
than
I
do
on
that
day
when
I
see
you
last
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
wrong
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
have
by
this
time
come
up
to
Tom
,
and
now
he
grasp
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
live
in
his
house
,
Pinch
,
and
have
him
fawn
on
me
day
and
week
and
month
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
suffer
him
to
treat
me
like
his
tool
and
instrument
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
it
;
you
have
see
me
there
.
<EOS>
I
have
undergo
ten
thousand
time
as
much
as
I
could
have
endure
if
I
have
be
the
miserable
weak
old
man
he
take
me
for

<EOS>
You
know
it

<EOS>
I
have
see
him
offer
love
to
Mary

<EOS>
You
know
it
;
<EOS>
who
better

<EOS>
who
better
,
my
true
heart

<EOS>
I
have
have
his
base
soul
bare
before
me
,
day
by
day
,
and
have
not
betray
myself
once

<EOS>
I
never
could
have
undergo
such
torture
but
for
look
forward
to
this
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
stop
,
even
in
the
passion
of
his
speech
---
if
that
can
be
call
passion
which
be
so
resolute
and
steady
---
to
press
Tom
's
hand
again
.
<EOS>
then
he
say
,
in
great
excitement
:
   
<EOS>
"
close
the
door
,
close
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
not
be
long
after
me
,
but
may
come
too
soon
.
 
<EOS>
the
time
now
draw
on
,
"
say
the
old
man
,
hurriedly
---
his
eye
and
whole
face
brighten
as
he
speak
<EOS>
---
"
will
make
amend
for
all

<EOS>
I
would
not

him
die
or
hang
himself
,
for
million
of
golden
piece
!
 
<EOS>
close
the
door
!

so
;

whether
he

Chapter
51
.
<EOS>
shed
new
and
bright
light
upon
the
very
dark
place
;
and
contain
the
sequel
of
the
enterprise
of
Mr
Jonas
and
his
friend
 
<EOS>
the
night
have
now
come
,
when
the
old
clerk
be
to
be
deliver
over
to
his
keeper
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
his
guilty
distraction
,
Jonas
have
not
forget
it
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
part
of
his
guilty
state
of
mind
to
remember
it
;
for
on
his
persistence
in
the
scheme
depend
one
of
his
precaution
for
his
own
safety
.
 
<EOS>
a
hint
,
a
word
,
from
the
old
man
,
utter
at
such
a
moment
in
attentive
ear
,
may
fire
the
train
of
suspicion
,
and
destroy
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
watchfulness
of
every
avenue
by
which
the
discovery
of
his
guilt
may
be
approach
,
sharpen
with
his
sense
of
the
danger
by
which
he
be
encompass
.
 
<EOS>
with
murder
on
his
soul
,
and
its
innumerable
alarm
and
terror
drag
at
him
night
and
day
,
he
would
have
repeat
the
crime
,
if
he
have
see
a
path
of
safety
stretch
out
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
his
punishment
;
it
be
in
his
guilty
condition
.
 
<EOS>
the
very
deed
which
his
fear
render
insupportable
,
his
fear
would
have
impel
him
to
commit
again
.
   
<EOS>
but
keep
the
old
man
close
,
accord
to
his
design
,
would
serve
his
turn
.
 
<EOS>
His
purpose
be
to
escape
,
when
the
first
alarm
and
wonder
have
subside
;
and
when
he
could
make
the
attempt
without
awaken
instant
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
meanwhile
these
woman
would
keep
him
quiet
;
and
if
the
talk
humour
come
upon
him
,
would
not
be
easily
startle
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
their
trade
.
   
<EOS>
nor
have
he
speak
idly
when
he
say
the
old
man
should
be
gag
.
<EOS>
He
have
resolve
to
ensure
his
silence
;
and
he
look
to
the
end
,
not
the
mean
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
rough
and
rude
and
cruel
to
the
old
man
all
his
life
;
and
violence
be
natural
to
his
mind
in
connection
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
shall
be
gag
if
he
speak
,
and
pinion
if
he
write
,
"
say
Jonas
,
look
at
him
;
for
they
sit
alone
together
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
mad
enough
for
that
;
I
will
go
through
with
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
Hush
!
   
<EOS>
still
listen
!
 
<EOS>
to
every
sound
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
listen
ever
since
,
and
it
have
not
come
yet
.
 
<EOS>
the
exposure
of
the
Assurance
office
;
the
flight
of
Crimple
and
Bullamy
with
the
plunder
,
and
among
the
rest
,
as
he
fear
,
with
his
own
bill
,
which
he
have
not
find
in
the
pocket
-
book
of
the
murder
man
,
and
which
with
Mr
Pecksniff
's
money
have
probably
be
remit
to
one
or
other
of
those
trusty
friend
for
safe
deposit
at
the
banker
's
;
his
immense
loss
,
and
peril
of
be
still
call
to
account
as
a
partner
in
the
broken
firm
;
all
these
thing
rise
in
his
mind
at
one
time
and
always
,
but
he
could
not
contemplate
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
aware
of
their
presence
,
and
of
the
rage
,
discomfiture
,
and
despair
,
they
bring
along
with
them
;
but
he
think
---
of
his
own
controlling
power
and
direction
he
think
---
of
the
one
dread
question
only
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
would
find
the
body
in
the
wood
.
   
<EOS>
He
try
---
he
have
never
leave
off
try
---
not
to
forget
it
be
there
,
for
that
be
impossible
,
but
to
forget
to
weary
himself
by
draw
vivid
picture
of
it
in
his
fancy
;
by
go
softly
about
it
and
about
it
among
the
leave
,
approach
it
nearer
and
near
through
a
gap
in
the
bough
,
and
startle
the
very
fly
that
be
thickly
sprinkle
all
over
it
,
like
heap
of
dry
currant
.
 
<EOS>
His
mind
be
fix
and
fasten
on
the
discovery
,
for
intelligence
of
which
he
listen
intently
to
every
cry
and
shout
;
listen
when
any
one
come
in
or
go
out
;
watch
from
the
window
the
people
who
pass
up
and
down
the
street
;
mistrust
his
own
look
and
word
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
more
his
thought
be
set
upon
the
discovery
,
the
strong
be
the
fascination
which
attract
them
to
the
thing
itself
;
lie
alone
in
the
wood
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
for
ever
show
and
present
it
,
as
it
be
,
to
every
creature
whom
he
see
.
 
<EOS>
"
look
here
!
 
<EOS>
do
you
know
of
this
?
 
<EOS>
be
it
find
?
 
<EOS>
do
you
suspect
me
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
be
condemn
to
bear
the
body
in
his
arm
,
and
lie
it
down
for
recognition
at
the
foot
of
every
one
he
meet
,
it
could
not
have
be
more
constantly
with
him
,
or
a
cause
of
more
monotonous
and
dismal
occupation
than
it
be
in
this
state
of
his
mind

<EOS>
still
he
be
not
sorry
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
contrition
or
remorse
for
what
he
have
do
that
move
him
;
it
be
nothing
but
alarm
for
his
own
security
.
 
<EOS>
the
vague
consciousness
he
possess
of
have
wreck
his
fortune
in
the
murderous
venture
,
intensify
his
hatred
and
revenge
,
and
make
him
set
the
great
store
by
what
he
have
gain
the
man
be
dead
;
nothing
could
undo
that
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
a
triumph
yet
,
in

He

,
and

interval

They

make
uneasy
at

by
the
absence

<EOS>
no

the
bottom
of
this
;
but
he
have
a
misgiving
that
she
may
have

tempt
into

something
that
would
criminate
him
when
the
news
come

for

<EOS>
Confound

<EOS>
the
old
man
,
mutter
some
word
softly
,
rise
as
if
he
would
have

,
but
Jonas
thrust
him
back
into
his
chair
with
an
impatient
imprecation
,
and

It

His

Mrs

look
at

appear

"
what

<EOS>
"
Her

<EOS>
It
be
extraordinary
how
much
effort
it
cost
Mrs

to
pronounce
the

she
be
commonly
so
ready
with
.
 
<EOS>
She
make
some
three

four
gasp
before
she
could
get
it
out
;
and
,
when
she
have
utter
it
,
press
her
hand
upon
her
side
,
and
turn
up
her
eye
,
as
if
she
be
go
to
faint
away

<EOS>
but
,
know
her
to
labour
under
a
complication
of
internal
disorder
,
which
render
a
few
drop
of
spirit
indispensable
at
certain
time
to
her
existence
,
and
which
come
on
very
strong
when
that
remedy
be
not
at
hand
,
Jonas
merely
suppose
her
to
be
the
victim
of
one
of
these
attack
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
hastily
,
for
he
feel
how
incapable
he
be
of
confine
his
wander
attention
to
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
and
she
have
arrange
to
take
care
of
him
,
have
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
reply
in
the
affirmative
,
and
softly
discharge
herself
of
her
familiar
phrase
,
"
turn
and
turn
about
;
one
off
,
one
on
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
she
speak
so
tremulously
that
she
feel
call
upon
to
add
,
"
which
fiddle

weakness
to
expredge

"
We

Mrs

assent
with
a
short
groan

Mrs

take
two
or
three
backward

towards
the

and
stop
there

<EOS>
"
It

in

<EOS>

the
ghastly
change
in
Jonas
tell
her
that

<EOS>
before
she
could
look
round
towards

she

put
aside
by
old
Martin

hand

and
Chuffey

John
Westlock

with
him
.

<EOS>
"
what

faintly

<EOS>
"

the
right
of
your

"
   
<EOS>
an
irrepressible
exclamation
burst
from
the
lip
of
Jonas
,
as
Lewsome
enter
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
groan
,
or
a
shriek
,
or
a
word
,
but
be
wholly
unlike
any
sound
that
have
ever
fall
on
the
ear
of
those
who
hear
it
,
while
at
the
same
time
it
be
the
most
sharp
and
terrible
expression
of
what
be
work
in
his
guilty
breast
,
that
nature
could
have
invent
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
do
murder
for
this
!
 
<EOS>
He
have
girdle
himself
about
with
peril
,
agony
of
mind
,
innumerable
fear
,
for
this
!
 
<EOS>
He
have
hide
his
secret
in
the
wood
;
press
and
stamp
it
down
into
the
bloody
ground
;
and
here
it
start
up
when
least
expect
,
mile
upon
mile
away
;
know
to
many
;
proclaim
itself
from
the
lip
of
an
old
man
who
have
renew
his
strength
and
vigour
as
by
a
miracle
,
to
give
it
voice
against
him
!
   
<EOS>
He
lean
his
hand
on
the
back
of
a
chair
,
and
look
at
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
to
try
to
do
so
scornfully
,
or
with
his
usual
insolence
.
<EOS>
He
require
the
chair
for
his
support
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
make
a
struggle
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
fellow

he
say
,
fetch
his
breath
at
every
word

point
his
tremble
finger
towards
Lewsome

He

the
great
liar
alive

You

why

that
uncle
of
mine

age

Chuffey

he
add

look
fiercely
at
John
Westlock

Mark
Tapley
(
the

have
enter
with
Lewsome

with
that

Mark
fold
his
arm
,
and
take
his
seat
upon
the
window
-
ledge
,
with
an
air
of
general
preparation
for
anything

which
seem
to
imply
that
he
be
equally
ready
to
jump
out

the
slight
hint

<EOS>
"
You
need
do
no
more

at

be
sure
of
that

of
the
truth

I
have

down
upon

turn
away
his
face

silent

a
few
moment

recovered
energy

You

so

the
old
man
with
a
childish
delight

Jonas
hear
this
with
a
sink
heart

He
know
that
they
be
on

run
him
to
destruction

inch

inch

slide
from

faster

faster
the
encircle
ruin
contract
and
contract
towards
himself
,
its
wicked
centre
,
until
it
should
close
in
and
crush
him
.
   
<EOS>
and
now
he
hear
the
voice
of
his
accomplice
state
to
his
face
,
with
every
circumstance
of
time
and
place
and
incident
;
and
openly
proclaim
,
with
no
reserve
,
suppression

passion

or
concealment

all
the
truth

the
truth

which
nothing
would
keep
down

which
blood
would
not
smother
,
and
earth
would
not
hide
;
the
truth
,
whose
terrible
inspiration
seem
to
change
dotard
into
strong
man
;

on
whose
avenge
wing
,
one
whom
he
have
suppose
to
be
at
the
extremest
corner
of
the
earth
come
swoop
down
upon

He
try
to
deny
it
,

his
tongue
would
not
move

<EOS>
He
conceive
some
desperate
thought
of
rush
away
,
and
tear
through
the
street

his
limb
would
as
little
answer
to
his

as
his
stark

stiff
staring
face

<EOS>
all
this
time
the
voice
go
slowly
on

denounce
him

It
be
as

him

when

up
the
tale

strangely
;
for
the

have
watch

listen
to
the
whole

have
wring
his
hand
from

break
in
with
these

just
now

up

after
look
about

up

with

take
it
twenty
time

with
the
strong
emotion

possess
him

,
with

light
in
his
eye

with
his

outstretche

with
his
grey
hair
stir
on
his

seem
to
grow
in

shrink
from

cower
down

go
so
often

there
together

He
take
it
into
his
possession

make
light
of
it
at
the
time

in
the
night
he
come
to

weeping
,
and
tell
me
that
his

They
get
him
away

<EOS>
Mr

have
so
present
his

that
he

have
become
the

the

the

to
this

he
bring
,
not

the
energy

determination
natural
to

which

as

be
remarkable

the

all
the

unnaturally
nurture
energy
consequent

Heaven
know

,
be
as
much
as
John
Westlock

Mark

though
they
be

John

<EOS>
have
a
lively
recollection
of
Mr

he
have
cause
that
gentleman
's
attendance
to
be
secure
,
through
John

mean
,
without

thus
,
as
we
have
see
,
they
have
all
repair
together
to
the
City
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
grandson
he
have
refuse
to
see
until
to
-
morrow
,
when
Mr
Tapley
be
instruct
to
summon
him
to
the
Temple
at
ten
o'clock
in
the
forenoon
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
he
would
not
allow
to
be
employ
in
anything
,
lest
he
should
be
wrongfully
suspect
;
but
he
be
a
party
to
all
their
proceeding
,
and
be
with
them
until
late
at
night
---
until
after
they
know
of
the
death
of
Jonas
;
when
he
go
home
to
tell
all
these
wonder
to
little

for
accompany
him
to

Temple
in

agreeably
to
Mr
Chuzzlewit
's
particular
injunction

<EOS>
It
be
characteristic
of
old
Martin
,
and
his
look
on
to
something
which
he
have
distinctly
before
him
,
that
he
communicate
to
them
nothing
of
his
intention
,
beyond
such
hint
of
reprisal
on
Mr
Pecksniff
as
they
gather
from
the
game
he
have
play
in
that
gentleman
's
house
,
and
the
brightening
of
his
eye
whenever
his
name
be
mention
.
 
<EOS>
even
to
John
Westlock
,
in
whom
he
be
evidently
dispose
to
place
great
confidence
(
which
may
indeed
be
say
of
every
one
of
them
)
,
he
give
no
explanation
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
He
merely
request
him
to
return
in
the
morning
;
and
with
this
for
their
utmost
satisfaction
,
they
leave
him
,
when
the
night
be
far
advanced
,
alone
.
   
<EOS>
the
event
of
such
a
day
may
have
wear
out
the
body
and
spirit
of
a
much
young
man
than
he
,
but
he
sit
in
deep
and
painful
meditation
until
the
morning
be
bright
.
 
<EOS>
nor
do
he
even
then
seek
any
prolonged
repose

merely
slumber
in
his
chair

until
seven
o'clock
,
when
Mr
Tapley
have
appoint
to
come
to
him
by
his
desire
;
and
come
---
as
fresh
and
clean
and
cheerful
as
the
morning
itself

"

I

my
opinion
that
Mr

would
find
himself
deceive

and
that
you
would
find
yourself
deceive

that

<EOS>

<EOS>
in

ask
Mr

"
   
<EOS>
"
well

<EOS>
"
in
your

his

I
know
he

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
I
<EOS>
know'd
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
long
afore

I
must

nobody

nobody
can

there

good
in

a

of

somehow

<EOS>
I
can
not

who
roll
the
paste

I
beg
your

I

Unintentional

I

I

there

<EOS>
now
I
have
get
rid

say
Mr

in

fit
of
desperation

I
can
not

<EOS>
It

clear
that
Mark
expect
to
be
order
out
immediately
,

be
quite
prepared

go

"
so
you

in

of

Mr

I

It
be
hardly
fair
of
you

to
make
a

I
do

I
be
as
respectful

disposed
to
you

as
a

I
do
think
so

<EOS>
the
light
of
a
faint
smile
seem
to
break
through
the
dull
steadiness
of
Martin
's
face
,
as
he
look
attentively
at
him
,
without
reply

<EOS>
"
yet
you
be

likewise
wery
much
so

<EOS>
the

with

rest
on

pace
the

twice

thrice
before

:

You

<EOS>
"
He

I

His

perhaps

he
may
think

<EOS>

I
have

reply
Mark
,
without
the
loss
of
any
atom
of
his
self

possession
;

we
have
be

my

no

<EOS>
"
Will

some
breakfast

ask
Martin

with
pleasure

by

Martin

remain
in

I

yonder

"
   
<EOS>
"
certainly

Mr

.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
find
it
necessary
to
express
surprise
at
their
appearance
,
"
Martin
suggest
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
dear
no
,
sir
!
"
say
Mr
Tapley
,
"
not
at
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
although
he
pledge
himself
to
this
with
perfect
confidence
,
he
be
in
a
state
of
unbounded
astonishment
even
now
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
appear
to
observe
it
,
and
to
have
some
sense
of
the
ludicrous
bearing
of
Mr
Tapley
under
these
perplexing
circumstance
;
for
,
in
spite
of
the
composure
of
his
voice
and
the
gravity
of
his
face
,
the
same
indistinct
light
flicker
on
the
latter
several
time
.
 
<EOS>
Mark
bestir
himself
,
however
,
to
execute
the
office
with
which
he
be
entrust
;
and
soon
lose
all
tendency
to
any
outward
expression
of
his
surprise
,
in
the
occupation
of
be
brisk
and
busy
.
   
<EOS>
but
when
he
have
put
Mr
Chuzzlewit
's
clothe
in
good
order
for
dressing
,
and
when
that
gentleman
be
dress
and
sit
at
his
breakfast
,
Mr
Tapley
's
feeling
of
wonder
begin
to
return
upon
him
with
great
violence
;
and
,
stand
beside
the
old
man
with
a
napkin
under
his
arm
(
it
be
as
natural
and
easy
to
joke
to
Mark
to
be
a
butler
in
the
Temple
,
as
it
have
be
to
volunteer
as
cook
on
board
the
Screw
)
,
he
find
it
difficult
to
resist
the
temptation
of
cast
sidelong
glance
at
him
very
often
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
he
find
it
impossible
;
and
accordingly
yield
to
this
impulse
so
often
,
that
Martin
catch
him
in
the
fact
some
fifty
time
.
 
<EOS>
the
extraordinary
thing
Mr
Tapley
do
with
his
own
face
when
any
of
these
detection
occur
;
the
sudden
occasion
he
have
to
rub
his
eye
or
his
nose
or
his
chin
;
the
look
of
wisdom
with
which
he
immediately
plunge
into
the
deep
thought
,
or
become
intensely
interested
in
the
habit
and
custom
of
the
fly
upon
the
ceiling
,
or
the
sparrow
out
of
door
;
or
the
overwhelming
politeness
with
which
he
endeavour
to
hide
his
confusion
by
hand
the
muffin
;
may
not
unreasonably
be
assume
to
have
exercise
the
utmost
power
of
feature
that
even
Martin
Chuzzlewit
the
elder
possess
.
   
<EOS>
but
he
sit
perfectly
quiet
and
take
his
breakfast
at
his
leisure
,
or
make
a
show
of
do
so
,
for
he
scarcely
eat
or
drank
,
and
frequently
lapse
into
long
interval
of
musing
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
finish
,
Mark
sit
down
to
his
breakfast
at
the
same
table
;
and
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
quite
silent
still
,
walk
up
and
down
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
Mark
clear
away
in
due
course
,
and
set
a
chair
out
for
him
,
in
which
,
as
the
time
draw
on
towards
ten
o'clock
,
he
take
his
seat
,
lean
his
hand
upon
his
stick
,
and
clench
them
upon
the
handle
,
and
rest
his
chin
on
them
again
.
 
<EOS>
all
his
impatience
and
abstraction
of
manner
have
vanish
now
;
and
as
he
sit
there
,
look
,
with
his
keen
eye
,
steadily
towards
the
door
,
Mark
could
not
help
think
what
a
firm
,
square
,
powerful
face
it
be
;
or
exult
in
the
thought
that
Mr
Pecksniff
,
after
play
a
pretty
long
game
of
bowl
with
its
owner
,
seem
to
be
at
last
in
a
very
fair
way
of
come
in
for
a
rubber
or
two
.
   
<EOS>
Mark
's
uncertainty
in
respect
of
what
be
go
to
be
do
or
say
,
and
by
whom
to
whom
,
would
have
excite
him
in
itself
.
 
<EOS>
but
know
for
a
certainty
besides
,
that
young
Martin
be
come
,
and
in
a
very
few
minute
must
arrive
<EOS>
,
he
find
it
by
no
means
easy
to
remain
quiet
and
silent
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
except
that
he
occasionally
cough
in
a
hollow
and
unnatural
manner
to
relieve
himself
,
he
behave
with
great
decorum
through
the
long
ten
minute
he
have
ever
know
.
   
<EOS>
a
knock
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Westlock
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tapley
,
in
admit
him
,
raise
his
eyebrow
to
the
high
possible
pitch
,
imply
thereby
that
he
consider
himself
in
an
unsatisfactory
position
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chuzzlewit
receive
him
very
courteously
.
   
<EOS>
Mark
wait
at
the
door
for
Tom
Pinch
and
his
sister
,
who
be
come
up
the
stair
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
man
go
to
meet
them
;
take
their
hand
in
his
;
and
kiss
her
on
the
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
as
this
look
promising
,
Mr
Tapley
smile
benignantly
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Chuzzlewit
have
resume
his
chair
before
young
Martin
,
who
be
close
behind
them
,
enter
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
man
,
scarcely
look
at
him
,
point
to
a
distant
seat
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
less
encouraging
;
and
Mr
Tapley
's
spirit
fall
again
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
quickly
summon
to
the
door
by
another
knock
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
start
,
or
cry
,
or
tumble
down
,
at
sight
of
Miss
Graham
and
Mrs
Lupin
,
but
he
draw
a
very
long
breath
,
and
come
back
perfectly
resign
,
look
on
them
and
on
the
rest
with
an
expression
which
seem
to
say
that
nothing
could
surprise
him
any
more
;
and
that
he
be
rather
glad
to
have
do
with
that
sensation
for
ever
.
   
<EOS>
the
old
man
receive
Mary
no
less
tenderly
than
he
have
receive
Tom
Pinch
's
sister
.
 
<EOS>
a
look
of
friendly
recognition
pass
between
himself
and
Mrs
Lupin
,
which
imply
the
existence
of
a
perfect
understanding
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
engender
no
astonishment
in
Mr
Tapley
;
for
,
as
he
afterwards
observe
,
he
have
retire
from
the
business
,
and
sell
off
the
stock
.
   
<EOS>
not
the
least
curious
feature
in
this
assemblage
be
,
that
everybody
present
be
so
much
surprised
and
embarrassed
by
the
sight
of
everybody
else
,
that
nobody
venture
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chuzzlewit
alone
break
silence

<EOS>
the
last
appoint
footstep
sound
now
upon
the
stair
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Mr
Pecksniff
's
;
and
Mr
Pecksniff
be
in
a
hurry
too
,
for
he
come
bound
up
with
such
uncommon
expedition
that
he
stumble
twice
or
thrice
.
   
<EOS>
"
where
be
my
venerable
friend
?
"
<EOS>
he
cry
upon
the
upper
landing
;
and
then
with
open
arm
come
dart
in
.
   
<EOS>
Old
Martin
merely
look
at
him
;
but
Mr
Pecksniff
start
back
as
if
he
have
receive
the
charge
from
an
electric
battery
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
venerable

"
cry
Mr
Pecksniff

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
quite
well

"
   
<EOS>
It
seem
to
reassure
the
anxious
inquirer
.
 
<EOS>
He
clasp
his
hand
and
,
look
upwards
with
a
pious
joy
,
silently
express
his
gratitude
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
look
round
on
the
assemble
group
,
and
shake
his
head
reproachfully
.
 
<EOS>
for
such
a
man
severely
,
quite
severely

<EOS>
"
oh

vermin

"
say
Mr
Pecksniff

<EOS>
"
oh

bloodsucker

be
it
not
enough
that
you
have
embitter
the
existence
of
an
individual
wholly
unparalleled
in
the
biographical
record

amiable
person

must
you
now

even
now

have
make

repose
his

Numble

at

sincere

I

use

what

what
Tom
Pinch
's
sister
say
to
John
Westlock
;
what
Tom
Pinch
say
to
both
of
them
;
and
how
they
all
pass
the
remainder
of
the
day
 
brilliantly
the
Temple
Fountain
sparkle
in
the
sun
,
and
laughingly
its
liquid
music
play
,
and
merrily
the
idle
drop
of
water
dance
and
dance
,
and
peep
out
in
sport
among
the
tree
,
plunge
lightly
down
to
hide
themselves
,
as
little
Ruth
and
her
companion
come
toward
it
.
   
<EOS>
and
why
they
come
toward
the
Fountain
at
all
<EOS>
be
a
mystery
;
for
they
have
no
business
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
in
their
way
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
quite
out
of
their
way

<EOS>
They
have
no
more
to
do
with
the

bless
you

than
they
have
with

with
Love

or
any
out

of

the

way
thing
of
that
sort

<EOS>
It
be
all
very
well
for
Tom

his
sister
to
make
appointment
by
the
Fountain
,

that
be
quite
another
affair

<EOS>
because
,
of
course
,
when
she
have
to
wait
a
minute
or
two
,
it
would
have
be
very
awkward
for
her
to
have
have
to
wait
in
any
but
a
tolerably
quiet
spot
;
but
that
be
as
quiet
a
spot
,
everything
consider
,
as
they
could
choose
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
she
have
John
Westlock
to
take
care

her

and
be
go
home

(
home

quite
extraordinary

<EOS>
however
,
there
they
find
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
and
another
extraordinary
part
of
the
matter
be
,
that
they
seem
to
have
come
there
,
by
a
silent
understanding
.
 
<EOS>
yet
when
they
get
there

they
be
a
little
confused
by
be
there

which
be
the
strange
part
of
all

because
there
be
nothing
naturally
confusing
in
a
Fountain

<EOS>
We
all
know
that

what
a
good

place
it

with

They

to
praise
it

<EOS>
the
day
be
exquisite
;
and
stop
at
all
,
it
be
quite
natural
---
nothing
could
be
more
so
---
that
they
should
glance
down
Garden
Court
;
because
Garden
Court
end
in
the
Garden
,
and
the
Garden
end
in
the
River
,
and
that
glimpse
be
very
bright
and
fresh
and
shine
on
a
summer

day

<EOS>
then
,
oh
,
little
Ruth
,
why
not
look
boldly
at
it
!
 
<EOS>
why
fit
that
tiny
,
precious

bless
little
foot
into
the
cracked
corner
of
an
insensible
old
flagstone
in
the
pavement

be
so
very
anxious
to
adjust
it
to
a
nicety

in

afterwards

They
talk

They
talk

all
these
change

the
attachment
Mr

conceive
for

the

sooner
than
have
a
pause
<EOS>
she
would
say
the

thing
over
again
;
and
if
she
have
not
courage

for
that
(
to

the
truth

I
be
sure
he
have
never

of
such
a

"
   
<EOS>
of
course
John
ask
her
immediately
---
because
you
know
they
be
in
that
foolish
state
when
great
allowance
must
be
make
---
when
she
have
begin
to
think
of
such
a
thing
,
and
this
make
a
little
diversion
in
their
talk
;
a
charming
diversion
to
them
,
but
not
so
interesting
to
us
;
at
the
end
of
which
,
they
come
back
to
Tom
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
dear
Tom
!
"
say
Ruth
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
ought
to
tell
you
everything
now

<EOS>
I
should
have
no
secret
from
you

<EOS>
Should
I
,
John
,
love
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
of
no
use
say
how
that
preposterous
John
answer
her
,
because
he
answer
in
a
manner
which
be
untranslatable
on
paper
though
highly
satisfactory
in
itself
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
he
convey
be
,
no
no
no
,
sweet
Ruth
;
or
something
to
that
effect
.
   
<EOS>
then
she
tell
him
Tom
's
great
secret
;
not
exactly
say
how
she
have
find
it
out
,
but
leave
him
to
understand
it
if
he
like
;
and
John
be
sadly
grieve
to
hear
it
,
and
be
full
of
sympathy
and
sorrow
.
<EOS>
but
they
would
try
,
he
say
,
only
the
more
,
on
this
account
to
make
him
happy
,
and
to
beguile
him
with
his
favourite
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
in
all
the
confidence
of
such
a
time
,
he
tell
her
how
he
have
a
capital
opportunity
of
establish
himself
in
his
old
profession
in
the
country
;
and
how
he
have
be
think
,
in
the
event
of
that
happiness
come
upon
him
which
have
actually
come
---
there
be
another
slight
diversion
here
<EOS>
---
how
he
have
be
think
that
it
would
afford
occupation
to
Tom
,
and
enable
them
to
live
together
in
the
easy
manner
,
without
any
sense
of
dependence
on
Tom
's
part
;
and
to
be
as
happy
as
the
day
be
long
.
 
<EOS>
and
Ruth
receive
this
with
joy
,
they
go
on
catering
for
Tom
to
that
extent
that
they
have
already
purchase
him
a
select
library
and
build
him
an
organ
,
on
which
he
be
perform
with
the
great
satisfaction
,
when
they
hear
him
knock
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
though
she
long
to
tell
him
what
have
happen
,
poor
little
Ruth
be
greatly
agitate
by
his
arrival
;
the
more
so
because
she
know
that
Mr
Chuzzlewit
be
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
say
,
all
in
a
tremble
:
   
<EOS>
"
what
shall
I
do
,
dear
John
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
that
he
should
hear
it
from
any
one
but
me
,
and
I
could
not
tell
him
,
unless
we
be
alone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
,
my
love

"
say
John
,
"
whatever
be
natural
to
you
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
,
and
I
be
sure
it
will
be
right
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
have
hardly
time
to
say
thus
much
,
and
Ruth
have
hardly
time
to
---
 
just
to
get
a
little
farther
off
---
upon
the
sofa
,
when
Tom
and
Mr
Chuzzlewit
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chuzzlewit
come
first
,
and
Tom
be
a
few
second
behind
him
.
   
<EOS>
now
Ruth
have
hastily
resolve
that
she
would
beckon
Tom
upstairs
after
a
short
time
,
and
would
tell
him
in
his
little
bedroom
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
she
see
his
dear
old
face
come
in
,
her
heart
be
so
touch
that
she
run
into
his
arm
,
and
lay
her
head
down
on
his
breast
and
sob
out
,
"
bless
me
,
Tom
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
brother
!
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
look
up
,
in
surprise
,
and
see
John
Westlock
close
beside
him
,
hold
out
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
John

"
cry
Tom

<EOS>
"

say
his

,
"
give
me
your
hand

<EOS>
We
be

"
   
<EOS>
Tom
wring
it
with
all
his
force
,
embrace
his
sister
fervently
,
and
put
her
in
John
Westlock
's
arm
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
not

Heaven
be
very
good
to

<EOS>
Tom
could
find
no
further
utterance
,
but
leave
the
room
;
and
Ruth
go
after
him
.
   
<EOS>
and
when
they
come
back
,
which
they
do
by
-
and

very
hard

her
finger
be

confused

bashful
,
with
the
smile

blush
play
brightly
on
her
face
,
like
the
sparkling
light

there

not

I
may
claim

much
indulgence

Augustus
will
conduct

I
bear
no

I

it
to
Augustus

to
be
punctual
on

suppose
to
be

to
be
impatient

They

as
little
of

Miss

the
bitterness
of
her
mortification
;
the
bitterness
of

the
bitterness
of

nosed

tower
triumphant
in

hour
of
their

<EOS>
Miss

have
faint
away
in

<EOS>
what

Tom

Thy
head
be
prematurely
grey
,
though
Time
have
pass
thee
and
our
old
association
,
Tom

<EOS>
but
,
in
those
sound
with
which
it
be
thy
will
not
to
bear
the
twilight
company
,
the
music
of
thy
heart
speak
out
---
the
story
of
thy
life
relate
itself
.
   
<EOS>
Thy
life
be
tranquil
,
calm
,
and
happy
,
Tom

<EOS>
in
the
soft
strain
which
ever
and
again
come
steal
back
upon
the
ear
,
the
memory
of
thine
old
love
may
find
a
voice
perhaps
;
but
it
be
a
pleasant
,
soften
,
whisper
memory
,
like
that
in
which
we
sometimes
hold
the
dead
,
and
do
not
pain
or
grieve
thee
,
God
be
thank
.
   
<EOS>
touch
the
note
lightly
,
Tom
,
as
lightly
as
thou
wilt
,
but
never
will
thine
hand
<EOS>
fall
half
so
lightly
on
that
instrument
as
on
the
head
of
thine
old
tyrant
bring
down
very
,
very
low
;
and
never
will
it
make
as
hollow
a
response
to
any
touch
of
thine
,
as
he
do
always
.

a
shrewish
daughter
,
haunt
thee
,
Tom

and
when
he
make
appeal
to
thee
for
cash
,
remind
thee
that
he
build
thy
fortune
well
than
his
own
;
and
when
he
spend
it
,
entertain
the
alehouse
company
with
tale
of
thine
ingratitude
and
his
munificence
towards
thee
once
upon
a
time
;
and
then
he
show
his
elbow
wear
in
hole
,
and
put
his
soleless
shoe
up
on
a
bench
,
and
beg
his
auditor
look
there
,
while
thou
art
comfortably
house

so
,
with
a
smile
upon
thy

thou
passest
gently
to
another
measure

to
a
quick
and
more
joyful
one
---
and
little
foot
be
use
to
dance
about
thee
at
the
sound
,
and
bright
young
eye
to
glance
up
into
thine
.
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
one
slight
creature
,
Tom
---
her
child
;
not
Ruth
's
---
whom
thine
eye
follow
in
the
romp
and
dance
;
who
,
wonder
sometimes
to
see
thee
look
so
thoughtful
,
run
to
climb
up
on
thy
knee
,
and
put
her
cheek
to
thine
;
who
love
thee
,
Tom
,
above
the
rest
,
if
that
can
be
;
and
fall
sick
once
,
choose
thee
for
her
nurse
,
and
never
know
impatience

Tom
,
when
thou
wert
by
her
side
.
   
<EOS>
Thou
glidest
,
now
,
into
a
graver
air
;
an
air
devote
to
old
friend
and
bygone
time
;
and
in
thy
linger
touch
upon
the
key
,
and
the
rich
swelling
of
the
mellow
harmony
,
they
rise
before
thee
.
 
<EOS>
the
spirit
of
that
old
man
dead
,
who
delight
to
anticipate
thy
want
,
and
never
cease
to
honour
thee
,
be
there
,
among
the
rest
;
repeat
,
with
a
face
compose
and
calm
,
the
word
he
say
to
thee
upon
his
bed
,
and
bless
thee
!
   
<EOS>
and
come
from
a
garden
,
Tom
,
bestrew
with
flower
by
child
's
hand
,
thy
sister
,
little
Ruth
,
as
light
of
foot
and
heart
as
in
old
day
,
sit
down
beside
thee
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
Present
,
and
the
past
,
with
which
she
be
so
tenderly
entwine
in
all
thy
thought

thy
strain
soar
onward
to
the
Future

as
it
resound
within
thee
and
without
,
the
noble
music
,
roll
round
ye
both
,
shut
out
the
gross
prospect
of
an
earthly
parting
,
and
uplifts
ye
both
to
Heaven
