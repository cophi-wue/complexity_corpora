<EOS>
I
be
bear
 
whether
I
shall
turn
out
to
be
the
hero
of
my
own
life
,
or
whether
that
station
will
be
hold
by
anybody
else
,
these

<EOS>
to
begin
my
life
with
the
beginning
of
my
life
,
I
record
that
I
be
bear
(
as
I
have
be
inform
and
believe
)
on
a
Friday
,
at
twelve
o'clock
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
remark
that
the
clock
begin
to
strike
,
and
I
begin
to
cry
,
simultaneously
.
   
<EOS>
in
consideration
of
the
day
and
hour
of
my
birth
,
it
be
declare
by
the
nurse
,
and
by
some
sage
woman
in
the
neighbourhood
who
have
take
a
lively
interest
in
me
several
month
before
there
be
any
possibility
of
our
become
personally
acquaint
,
first
,
that
I
be
destine
to
be
unlucky
in
life
;
and
secondly
,
that
I
be
privileged
to
see
ghost
and
spirit
;
both
these
gift
inevitably
attach
,
as
they
believe
,
to
all
unlucky
infant
of
either
gender
,
bear
towards
the
small
hour
on
a
Friday
night
.
   
<EOS>
I
need
say
nothing
here
,
on
the
first
head
,
because
nothing
can
show
well
than
my
history
whether
that
prediction
be
verify
or
falsify
by
the
result
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
second
branch
of
the
question
,
I
will
only
remark
,
that
unless
I
run
through
that
part
of
my
inheritance
while
I
be
still
a
baby
,
I
have
not
come
into
it
yet
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
at
all
complain
of
have
be
keep
out
of
this
property
;
and
if
anybody
else
should
be
in
the
present
enjoyment
of
it
,
he
be
heartily
welcome
to
keep
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
bear
with
a
caul
,
which
be
advertise
for
sale
,
in
the
newspaper
,
at
the
low
price
of
fifteen
guinea
.
 
<EOS>
whether
sea
-
go
people
be
short
of
money
about
that
time
,
or
be
short
of
faith
and
preferred
cork
jacket
,
I
do
not
know
;
all
I
know
be
,
that
there
be
but
one
solitary
bidding
,
and
that
be
from
an
attorney
connect
with
the
bill
-
broke
business
,
who
offer
two
pound
in
cash
,
and
the
balance
in
sherry
,
but
decline
to
be
guarantee
from
drown
on
any
high
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
consequently
the
advertisement
be
withdraw
at
a
dead
loss
---
for
as
to
sherry
,
my
poor
dear
mother
's
own
sherry
be
in
the
market
then
---
and
ten
year
afterwards
,
the
caul
be
put
up
in
a
raffle
down
in
our
part
of
the
country
,
to
fifty
member
at
half
-
a
-
crown
a
head
,
the
winner
to
spend
five
shilling
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
present
myself
,
and
I
remember
to
have
feel
quite
uncomfortable
and
confused
,
at
a
part
of
myself
be
dispose
of
in
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
the
caul
be
win
,
I
recollect
,
by
an
old
lady
with
a
hand
-
basket
,
who
,
very
reluctantly
,
produce
from
it
the
stipulate
five
shilling
,
all
in
halfpence
,
and
twopence
halfpenny
short
---
as
it
take
an
immense
time
and
a
great
waste
of
arithmetic
,
to
endeavour
without
any
effect
to
prove
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
fact
which
will
be
long
remember
as
remarkable
down
there
,
that
she
be
never
drown
,
but
die
triumphantly
in
bed
,
at
ninety
-
two
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
understand
that
it
be
,
to
the
last
,
her
proud
boast
,
that
she
never
have
be
on
the
water
in
her
life
,
except
upon
a
bridge
;
and
that
over
her
tea
(
to
which
she
be
extremely
partial
)
<EOS>
she
,
to
the
last
,
express
her
indignation
at
the
impiety
of
mariner
and
other
,
who
have
the
presumption
to
go
<EOS>
"
meander
"
about
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
to
represent
to
her
that
some
convenience
,
tea
perhaps
include
,
result
from
this
objectionable
practice
.
 
<EOS>
She
always
return
,
with
great
emphasis
and
with
an
instinctive
knowledge
of
the
strength
of
her
objection
,
"
let
us
have
no
meandering
.
"
   
<EOS>
not
to
meander
myself
,
at
present
,
I
will
go
back
to
my
birth
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
bear
at
Blunderstone
,
in
Suffolk
,
or
"
thereby
"
,
as
they
say
in
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
posthumous
child
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
's
eye
have
close
upon
the
light
of
this
world
six
month
,
when
mine
open
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
strange
to
me
,
even
now
,
in
the
reflection
that
he
never
see
me
;
and
something
strange
yet
in
the
shadowy
remembrance
that
I
have
of
my
first
childish
association
with
his
white
grave
-
stone
in
the
churchyard
,
and
of
the
indefinable
compassion
I
use
to
feel
for
it
lie
out
alone
there
in
the
dark
night
,
when
our
little
parlour
be
warm
and
bright
with
fire
and
candle
,
and
the
door
of
our
house
be
---
almost
cruelly
,
it
seem
to
me
sometimes
---
bolt
and
lock
against
it
.
   
<EOS>
an
aunt
of
my
father
's
,
and
consequently
a
great
-
aunt
of
mine
,
of
whom
I
shall
have
more
to
relate
by
and
by
,
be
the
principal
magnate
of
our
family
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Trotwood
,
or
Miss
Betsey
,
as
my
poor
mother
always
call
her
,
when
she
sufficiently
overcome
her
dread
of
this
formidable
personage
to
mention
her
at
all
(
which
be
seldom
)
,
have
be
marry
to
a
husband
young
than
herself
,
who
be
very
handsome
,
except
in
the
sense
of
the
homely
adage
,
"
handsome
be
,
that
handsome
do
"
---
for
he
be
strongly
suspect
of
have
beat
Miss
Betsey
,
and
even
of
have
once
,
on
a
dispute
question
of
supply
,
make
some
hasty
but
determined
arrangement
to
throw
her
out
of
a
two
pair
of
stair
'
window
.
<EOS>
these
evidence
of
an
incompatibility
of
temper
induce
Miss
Betsey
to
pay
him
off
,
and
effect
a
separation
by
mutual
consent
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
to
India
with
his
capital
,
and
there
,
accord
to
a
wild
legend
in
our
family
,
he
be
once
see
ride
on
an
elephant
,
in
company
with
a
baboon
;
but
I
think
it
must
have
be
a
Baboo
---
or
a
Begum
.
<EOS>
anyhow
,
from
India
tiding
of
his
death
reach
home
,
within
ten
year
.
 
<EOS>
how
they
affect
my
aunt
,
nobody
know
;
for
immediately
upon
the
separation
,
she
take
her
maiden
name
again
,
buy
a
cottage
in
a
hamlet
on
the
sea
-
coast
a
long
way
off
,
establish
herself
there
as
a
single
woman
with
one
servant
,
and
be
understand
to
live
secluded
,
ever
afterwards
,
in
an
inflexible
retirement
.
   
<EOS>
My
father
have
once
be
a
favourite
of
her
,
I
believe
;
but
she
be
mortally
affront
by
his
marriage
,
on
the
ground
that
my
mother
be
"
a
wax
doll
"
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
never
see
my
mother
,
but
she
know
her
to
be
not
yet
twenty
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
and
Miss
Betsey
never
meet
again
.
<EOS>
He
be
double
my
mother
's
age
when
he
marry
,
and
of
but
a
delicate
constitution
.
 
<EOS>
He
die
a
year
afterwards
,
and
,
as
I
have
say
,
six
month
before
I
come
into
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
the
state
of
matter
,
on
the
afternoon
of
,
what
I
may
be
excuse
for
call
,
that
eventful
and
important
Friday
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
make
no
claim
therefore
to
have
know
,
at
that
time
,
how
matter
stand
;
or
to
have
any
remembrance
,
found
on
the
evidence
of
my
own
sense
,
of
what
follow
.
   
<EOS>
My
mother
be
sit
by
the
fire
,
but
poorly
in
health
,
and
very
low
in
spirit
,
look
at
it
through
her
tear
,
and
despond
heavily
about
herself
and
the
fatherless
little
stranger
,
who
be
already
welcome
by
some
gross
of
prophetic
pin
,
in
a
drawer
upstairs
,
to
a
world
not
at
all
excited
on
the
subject
of
his
arrival
;
my
mother
,
I
say
,
be
sit
by
the
fire
,
that
bright
,
windy
March
afternoon
,
very
timid
and
sad
,
and
very
doubtful
of
ever
come
alive
out
of
the
trial
that
be
before
her
,
when
,
lift
her
eye
as
she
dry
them
,
to
the
window
opposite
,
she
see
a
strange
lady
come
up
the
garden
.
   
<EOS>
my
mother
have
a
sure
forebode
at
the
second
glance
,
that
it
be
Miss
Betsey
.
 
<EOS>
the
set
sun
be
glow
on
the
strange
lady
,
over
the
garden
-
fence
,
and
she
come
walk
up
to
the
door
with
a
fell
rigidity
of
figure
and
composure
of
countenance
that
could
have
belong
to
nobody
else
.
   
<EOS>
when
she
reach
the
house
,
she
give
another
proof
of
her
identity
.
<EOS>
My
father
have
often
hint
that
she
seldom
conduct
herself
like
any
ordinary
Christian
;
and
now
,
instead
of
ring
the
bell
,
she
come
and
look
in
at
that
identical
window
,
press
the
end
of
her
nose
against
the
glass
to
that
extent
,
that
my
poor
dear
mother
use
to
say
it
become
perfectly
flat
and
white
in
a
moment
.
   
<EOS>
She
give
my
mother
such
a
turn
,
that
I
have
always
be
convince
I
be
indebted
to
miss
Betsey
for
have
be
bear
on
a
Friday
.
   
<EOS>
My
mother
have
leave
her
chair
in
her
agitation
,
and
go
behind
it
in
the
corner
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Betsey
,
look
round
the
room
,
slowly
and
inquiringly
,
begin
on
the
other
side
,
and
carry
her
eye
on
,
like
a
Saracen
's
head
in
a
dutch
clock
,
until
they
reach
my
mother
.
<EOS>
then
she
make
a
frown
and
a
gesture
to
my
mother
,
like
one
who
be
accustomed
to
be
obey
,
to
come
and
open
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
go
.
   
<EOS>
"

Miss
Betsey

my

's
mourning
weed
,
and
her
condition

<EOS>
"
yes

"
say
my

,
faintly

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
My

<EOS>
and
she
have
a
disagreeable
consciousness
of
not

to
imply
that
it
have
be
an
overpower
pleasure
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
you
see
her
,
"
say
Miss
Betsey
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
bend
her
head
,
and
beg
her
to
walk
in
.
   
<EOS>
They
go
into
the
parlour
my
mother
have
come
from

fire
in
the
good
room
on
the
other
side
of
the
passage
not
be
light
---
not
have
be
light
,
indeed
,
since
my
father
's
funeral
;
and
when
they
be
both
seated
,
and
Miss
Betsey
say
nothing
,
my
mother
,
after
vainly
try

<EOS>
"

"

<EOS>
My

notwithstanding

so
she
cry
until
she

her

out

"

Miss
Betsey

"
and
let
me
see

<EOS>
my
mother
be
too
much
afraid
of
her
to
refuse
compliance
with
this
odd
request
,
if
she
have
any
disposition
to
do
so

<EOS>
therefore
she
do
as
she

do
it
with
such
nervous

My

in

cotton

He
carry
his

partly

speak

Mr

look

"
Ya

"
say
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
with
such
a
snarl
at
him
,
that
Mr
Chillip
absolutely
could
not
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
really
calculated
to
break
his
spirit
,
he
say
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
He
prefer
to
go
and
sit
upon
the
stair
,
in
the
dark
and
a
strong
draught
,
until
he
be
again

Ham
Peggotty

who
go
to
the
national
school

and
be
a
very
dragon
at

and
who
may
therefore
be
regard
as
a
credible
witness

report
next
day

that
happen
to
peep
in
at
the

door
an
hour
after
this

he
be
instantly
descry
by
Miss
Betsey
,
then
walk
to
and
fro
in
a
state
of
agitation
,
and
pounce
upon
before
he
could
make
his
escape
.
 
<EOS>
that
there
be
now
occasional
sound
of
foot
and
voice
overhead
<EOS>
which
he
infer
the
cotton
do
not
exclude
,
from
the
circumstance
of
his
evidently
be
clutch
by
the
lady
as
a
victim
on
whom
to
expend
her
superabundant
agitation
when
the
sound
be
loud
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
march
him
constantly
up
and
down
by
the
collar
(
as
if
he
have
be
take
too
much
laudanum

she
,
at
those
time
,
shake
him
,
rumple
his
hair
,
make
light
of
his
linen
,
stop
his
ear
as
if
she
confound
them
with
her
own

and
otherwise
tousle
and
maltreat
him
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
in
part
confirm
by
his
aunt
,
who
see
him
at
half
past
twelve
o'clock
,
soon
after
his
release
,
and
affirm
that
he
be
then
as
red
as
I
be
.
   
<EOS>
the
mild
Mr
Chillip
could
not
possibly
bear
malice
at
such
a
time
,
if
at
any
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
sidle
into
the
parlour
as
soon
as
he
be
at
liberty
,
and
say
to
my
aunt
in
his
meek
manner
:
   
<EOS>
"

,
I
be
happy
to
congratulate
you

"
   
<EOS>
"
what

say
my

,
sharply
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Chillip
be
flutter
again
,
by
the
extreme
severity
of
my
aunt
's
manner
;
so
he
make
her
a
little
bow
and
give
her
a
little
smile
,
to
mollify
her
.
   
<EOS>
"

"
   
<EOS>
It
have
since
be
consider
almost
a
miracle
that
my
aunt
do
not
shake
him
,
and
shake
what
he
have
to
say
,
out
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
only
shake
her
own
head
at
him
,
but
in
a
way
that
make
him
quail

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
during
the
five
minute
or
so
that
Mr

devote
to
the
delivery
of
this
oration
,
my

eye
him
narrowly

<EOS>
"

my

fold
her

Mr

"
quite
as

we
can
expect
a

there

Mr

lay
his

a

<EOS>
My
aunt
say
never
a
word
,
but
take
her
bonnet
by
the
string
,
in
the
manner
of
a
sling
,
aim
a
blow
at
Mr
Chillip
's
head
with
it

put
it
on

walk
out

and
never

She
vanish
like

like
one

those
supernatural

it

popularly

I
be
entitled
to
see

and
never
come

any
more

<EOS>
no

I

the

shine
out
upon

Chapter
2
.
<EOS>
I
observe
 
<EOS>
the
first
object
that
assume
a
distinct
presence
before
me
,
as
I
look
far
back
,
into
the
blank
of
my
infancy
,
be
my
mother
with
her
pretty
hair
and
youthful
shape
,
and
Peggotty
with
no
shape
at
all
,
and
eye
<EOS>
so
dark
that
they
seem
to
darken
their
whole
neighbourhood
in
her
face
,
and
cheek
and
arm
so
hard
and
red
that
I
wonder
the
bird
do
not
peck
her
in
preference
to
apple
.
   
<EOS>
I
believe
I
can
remember
these
two
at
a
little
distance
apart
,
dwarf
to
my
sight
by
stoop
down
or
kneel
on
the
floor
,
and
I
go
unsteadily
from
the
one
to
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
an
impression
on
my
mind
which
I
can
not
distinguish
from
actual
remembrance
,
of
the
touch
of
Peggotty
's
forefinger
as
she
use
to
hold
it
out
to
me
,
and
of
its
be
roughen
by
needlework
,
like
a
pocket
nutmeg
-
grater
.
   
<EOS>
this
may
be
fancy
,
though
I
think
the
memory
of
most
of
us
can
go
farther
back
into
such
time
than
many
of
us
suppose
;
just
as
I
believe
the
power
of
observation
in
number
of
very
young
child
to
be
quite
wonderful
for
its
closeness
and
accuracy
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
think
that
most
grown
man
who
be
remarkable
in
this
respect
,
may
with
great
propriety
be
say
not
to
have
lose
the
faculty
,
than
to
have
acquire
it
;
the
rather
,
as
I
generally
observe
such
man
to
retain
a
certain
freshness
,
and
gentleness
,
and
capacity
of
be
pleased
,
which
be
also
an
inheritance
they
have
preserve
from
their
childhood
.
   
<EOS>
I
may
have
a
misgiving
that
I
be
"
meander
"
in
stop
to
say
this
,
but
that
it
bring
me
to
remark
that
I
build
these
conclusion
,
in
part
upon
my
own
experience
of
myself
;
and
if
it
should
appear
from
anything
I
may
set
down
in
this
narrative
that
I
be
a
child
of
close
observation
,
or
that
as
a
man
I
have
a
strong
memory
of
my
childhood
,
I
undoubtedly
lie
claim
to
both
of
these
characteristic
.
   
<EOS>
look
back
,
as
I
be
say
,
into
the
blank
of
my
infancy
,
the
first
object
I
can
remember
as
stand
out
by
themselves
from
a
confusion
of
thing
,
be
my
mother
and
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
what
else
do
I
remember
?
 
<EOS>
let
me
see
.
   
<EOS>
there
come
out
of
the
cloud
,
our
house
---
not
new
to
me
,
but
quite
familiar
,
in
its
early
remembrance
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
ground
-
floor
be
Peggotty
's
kitchen
,
open
into
a
back
yard
;
with
a
pigeon
-
house
on
a
pole
,
in
the
centre
,
without
any
pigeon
in
it
;
a
great
dog
-
kennel
in
a
corner
,
without
any
dog
;
and
a
quantity
of
fowl
that
look
terribly
tall
to
me
,
walk
about
,
in
a
menacing
and
ferocious
manner
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
one
cock
who
get
upon
a
post
to
crow
,
and
seem
to
take
particular
notice
of
me
as
I
look
at
him
through
the
kitchen
window
,
who
make
me
shiver
,
he
be
so
fierce
.
 
<EOS>
of
the
geese
outside
the
side
-
gate
who
come
waddle
after
me
with
their
long
neck
<EOS>
stretch
out
when
I
go
that
way
<EOS>
,
I
dream
at
night
:
<EOS>
as
a
man
environ
by
wild
beast
may
dream
of
lion
.
   
<EOS>
here
be
a
long
passage
---
what
an
enormous
perspective
I
make
of
it
!
<EOS>
---
lead
from
Peggotty
's
kitchen
to
the
front
door
.
 
<EOS>
a
dark
store
-
room
open
out
of
it
,
and
that
be
a
place
to
be
run
past
at
night
;
for
I
do
not
know
what
may
be
among
those
tub
and
jar
and
old
tea
-
chest
,
when
there
be
nobody
in
there
with
a
dimly
-
burn
light
,
let
a
mouldy
air
come
out
of
the
door
,
in
which
there
be
the
smell
of
soap
,
pickle
,
pepper
,
candle
,
and
coffee
,
all
at
one
whiff
.
 
<EOS>
then
there
be
the
two
parlour
:
the
parlour
in
which
we
sit
of
an
evening
,
my
mother
and
I
and
Peggotty
---
for
Peggotty
be
quite
our
companion
,
when
her
work
be
do
and
we
be
alone
---
and
the
good
parlour
where
we
sit
on
a
Sunday
;
grandly
,
but
not
so
comfortably
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
of
a
doleful
air
about
that
room
to
me
,
for
Peggotty
have
tell
me
---
I
do
not
know
when
,
<EOS>
but
apparently
age
ago
---
about
my
father
's
funeral
,
and
the
company
have
their
black
cloak
put
on
.
 
<EOS>
one
Sunday
night
my
mother
read
to
Peggotty
and
me
in
there
,
how
Lazarus
be
raise
up
from
the
dead
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
so
frightened
that
they
be
afterwards
oblige
to
take
me
out
of
bed
,
and
show
me
the
quiet
churchyard
out
of
the
bedroom
window
,
with
the
dead
all
lie
in
their
grave
at
rest
,
below
the
solemn
moon
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
half
so
green
that
I
know
anywhere
,
as
the
grass
of
that
churchyard
;
nothing
half
so
shady
as
its
tree
;
nothing
half
so
quiet
as
its
tombstone
.
 
<EOS>
the
sheep
be
feed
there
,
when
I
kneel
up
,
early
in
the
morning
,
in
my
little
bed
in
a
closet
within
my
mother
's
room
,
to
look
out
at
it
;
and
I
see
the
red
light
shine
on
the
sun
-
dial
,
and
think
within
myself
,
"
be
the
sun
-
dial
glad
,
I
wonder
,
that
it
can
tell
the
time
again
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
here
be
our
pew
in
the
church
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
high
-
back
pew
!
 
<EOS>
with
a
window
near
it
,
out
of
which
our
house
can
be
see
,
and
be
see
many
time
during
the
morning
's
service
,
by
Peggotty
,
who
like
to
make
herself
as
sure
as
she
can
that
it
be
not
be
rob
,
or
be
not
in
flame
.
 
<EOS>
but
though
Peggotty
's
eye
wander
,
she
be
much
offend
if
mine
do
,
and
frown
to
me
,
as
I
stand
upon
the
seat
,
that
I
be
to
look
at
the
clergyman
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
always
look
at
him
---
I
know
him
without
that
white
thing
on
,
and
I
be
afraid
of
his
wonder
why
I
stare
so
,
and
perhaps
stop
the
service
to
inquire
---
and
what
be
I
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
dreadful
thing
to
gape
,
but
I
must
do
something
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
at
my
mother
,
but
she
pretend
not
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
at
a
boy
in
the
aisle
,
and
he
make
face
at
me
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
the
sunlight
come
in
at
the
open
door
through
the
porch
,
and
there
I
see
a
stray
sheep
<EOS>
---
I
do
not
mean
a
sinner
,
but
mutton
---
half
make
up
his
mind
to
come
into
the
church
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
that
if
I
look
at
him
any
longer
,
I
may
be
tempt
to
say
something
out
loud
;
and
what
would
become
of
me
then
!
 
<EOS>
I
look
up
at
the
monumental
tablet
on
the
wall
,
and
try
to
think
of
Mr
Bodgers
late
of
this
parish
,
and
what
the
feeling
of
Mrs
Bodgers
must
have
be
,
when
affliction
sore
,
long
time
Mr
Bodgers
bore
,
and
physician
be
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
they
call
in
Mr
Chillip
,
and
he
be
in
vain
;
and
if
so
,
how
he
like
to
be
remind
of
it
once
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
from
Mr
Chillip
,
in
his
Sunday
neckcloth
,
to
the
pulpit
;
and
think
what
a
good
place
it
would
be
to
play
in
,
and
what
a
castle
it
would
make
,
with
another
boy
come
up
the
stair
to
attack
it
,
and
have
the
velvet
cushion
with
the
tassel
throw
down
on
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
in
time
my
eye
gradually
shut
up
;
and
,
from
seem
to
hear
the
clergyman
singe
a
drowsy
song
in
the
heat
,
I
hear
nothing
,
until
I
fall
off
the
seat
with
a
crash
,
and
be
take
out
,
more
dead
than
alive
,
by
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
and
now
I
see
the
outside
of
our
house
,
with
the
lattice
bedroom
-
window
stand
open
to
let
in
the
sweet
-
smell
air
,
and
<EOS>
the
ragged
old
rooks'-nests
still
dangle
in
the
elm
-
tree
at
the
bottom
of
the
front
garden
.
 
<EOS>
now
I
be
in
the
garden
at
the
back
,
beyond
the
yard
where
the
empty
pigeon
-
house
and
dog
-
kennel
be
---
a
very
preserve
of
butterfly
,
as
I
remember
it
,
with
a
high
fence
,
and
a
gate
and
padlock
;
where
the
fruit
cluster
on
the
tree
,
riper
and
rich
than
fruit
have
ever
be
since
,
in
any
other
garden
,
and
where
my
mother
gather
some
in
a
basket
,
while
I
stand
by
,
bolt
furtive
gooseberry
,
and
try
to
look
unmoved
.
 
<EOS>
a
great
wind
rise
,
and
the
summer
be
go
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
We
be
play
in
the
winter
twilight
,
dance
about
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
when
my
mother
be
out
of
breath
and
rest
herself
in
an
elbow
-
chair
,
I
watch
her
wind
her
bright
curl
round
her
finger
,
and
straiten
her
waist
,
and
nobody
know
well
than
I
do
that
she
like
to
look
so
well
,
and
be
proud
of
be
so
pretty
.
   
<EOS>
that
be
among
my
very
early
impression
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
and
a
sense
that
we
be
both
a
little
afraid
of
Peggotty
,
and
submit
ourselves
in
most
thing
to
her
direction
,
be
among
the
first
opinion
---
if
they
may
be
so
call
---
that
I
ever
derive
from
what
I
see
.
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
and
I
be
sit
one
night
by
the
parlour
fire
,
alone
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
read
to
Peggotty
about
crocodile
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
read
very
perspicuously
,
or
the
poor
soul
must
have
be
deeply
interested
,
for
I
remember
she
have
a
cloudy
impression
,
after
I
have
do
,
that
they
be
a
sort
of
vegetable
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
tired
of
reading
,
and
dead
sleepy
;
but
have
leave
,
as
a
high
treat
,
to
sit
up
until
my
mother
come
home
from
spend
the
evening
at
a
neighbour
's
,
I
would
rather
have
die
upon
my
post
(
of
course
)
than
have
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
reach
that
stage
of
sleepiness
when
Peggotty
seem
to
swell
and
grow
immensely
large
.
 
<EOS>
I
prop
my
eyelid
open
with
my
two
forefinger
,
and
look
perseveringly
at
her
as
she
sit
at
work
;
at
the
little
bit
of
wax
-
candle
she
keep
for
her
thread
---
how
old
it
look
,
be
so
wrinkle
in
all
direction
!
<EOS>
---
at
the
little
house
with
a
thatched
roof
,
where
the
yard
-
measure
live
;
at
her
work
-
box
with
a
slide
lid
,
with
a
view
of
St
Paul
's
Cathedral
(
with
a
pink
dome
)
paint
on
the
top
;
at
the
brass
thimble
on
her
finger
;
at
herself
,
whom
I
think
lovely
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
so
sleepy
,
that
I
know
if
I
lose
sight
of
anything
for
a
moment
,
I
be
go
.
   
<EOS>
"
Peggotty
,
"
say
I
,
suddenly
,
"
be
you
ever
marry
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
,
Master
Davy
,
"
reply
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
put
marriage
in
your
head
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
answer
with
such
a
start
,
that
it
quite
awake
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
she
stop
in
her
work
,
and
look
at
me
,
with
her
needle
draw
out
to
its
thread
's
length
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
be
you
ever
marry
,
Peggotty
?
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
very
handsome
woman
,
an't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
think
her
in
a
different
style
from
my
mother
,
certainly
;
but
of
another
school
of
beauty
,
I
consider
her
a
perfect
example
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
red
velvet
footstool
in
the
good
parlour
,
on
which
my
mother
have
paint
a
nosegay
.
 
<EOS>
the
ground
-
work
of
that
stool
,
and
Peggotty
's
complexion
appear
to
me
to
be
one
and
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
the
stool
be
smooth
,
and
Peggotty
be
rough
,
but
that
make
no
difference
.
   
<EOS>
"
Me
handsome
,
Davy
!
"
say
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lawk
,
no
,
my
dear
!
 
<EOS>
but
what
put
marriage
in
your
head
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
!
<EOS>
---
You
must
not
marry
more
than
one
person
at
a
time
,
may
you
,
Peggotty
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
certainly
not
,
"
say
Peggotty
,
with
the
promptest
decision
.
   
<EOS>
"
but
if
you
marry
a
person
,
and
the
person
die
,
why
then
you
may
marry
another
person
,
may
not
you
,
Peggotty
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
you
MAY
,
"
say
Peggotty
,
"
if
you
choose
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
a
matter
of
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
but
what
be
your
opinion
,
Peggotty
?
"
say
I.
   
I
ask
her
,
and
look
curiously
at
her
,
because
she
look
so
curiously
at
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
opinion
be
,
"
say
Peggotty
,
take
her
eye
from
me
,
after
a
little
indecision
and
go
on
with
her
work
,
"
that
I
never
be
marry
myself
,
Master
Davy
,
and
that
I
do
not
expect
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
all
I
know
about
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
an't
cross
,
I
suppose
,
Peggotty
,
be
you
?
"
<EOS>
say
I
,
after
sit
quiet
for
a
minute
.
   
<EOS>
I
really
think
she
be
,
she
have
be
so
short
with
me
;
but
I
be
quite
mistaken
:
for
she
lay
aside
her
work
(
which
be
a
stocking
of
her
own
)
,
and
open
her
arm
wide
,
take
my
curly
head
within
them
,
and
give
it
a
good
squeeze
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
be
a
good
squeeze
,
because
,
be
very
plump
,
whenever
she
make
any
little
exertion
after
she
be
dress
,
some
of
the
button
on
the
back
of
her
gown
fly
off
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
recollect
two
burst
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
parlour
,
while
she
be
hug
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
let
me
hear
some
more
about
the
Crorkindills
,
"
say
Peggotty
,
who
be
not
quite
right
in
the
name
yet
,
"
<EOS>
for
I
an't
hear
half
enough
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
quite
understand
why
Peggotty
look
so
queer
,
or
why
she
be
so
ready
to
go
back
to
the
crocodile
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
we
return
to
those
monster
,
with
fresh
wakefulness
on
my
part
,
and
we
leave
their
egg
in
the
sand
for
the
sun
to
hatch
;
and
we
run
away
from
them
,
and
baffle
them
by
constantly
turn
,
which
they
be
unable
to
do
quickly
,
on
account
of
their
unwieldy
make
;
and
we
go
into
the
water
after
them
,
as
native
,
and
put
sharp
piece
of
timber
down
their
throat
;
and
in
short
we
run
the
whole
crocodile
gauntlet
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
,
at
least
;
but
I
have
my
doubt
of
Peggotty
,
who
be
thoughtfully
stick
her
needle
into
various
part
of
her
face
and
arm
,
all
the
time
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
exhaust
the
crocodile
,
and
begin
with
the
alligator
,
when
the
garden
-
bell
rang
.
 
<EOS>
We
go
out
to
the
door
;
and
there
be
my
mother
,
look
unusually
pretty
,
I
think
,
and
with
her
a
gentleman
with
beautiful
black
hair
and
whisker
,
who
have
walk
home
with
us
from
church
last
Sunday
.
   
<EOS>
as
my
mother
stoop
down
on
the
threshold
to
take
me
in
her
arm
and
kiss
me
,
the
gentleman
say
I
be
a
more
highly
privileged
little
fellow
than
a
monarch
---
or
something
like
that
;
for
my
later
understanding
come
,
I
be
sensible
,
to
my
aid
here
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
do
that
mean
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
him
,
over
her
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
He
pat
me
on
the
head
;
but
somehow
,
I
do
not
like
him
or
his
deep
voice
,
and
I
be
jealous
that
his
hand
should
touch
my
mother
's
in
touch
me
---
which
it
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
it
away
,
as
well
as
I
could
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Davy
!
<EOS>
"
remonstrate
my
mother
.
   
<EOS>
"
dear
boy
!
"
say
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
wonder
at
his
devotion
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
never
see
such
a
beautiful
colour
on
my
mother
's
face
before
.
<EOS>
She
gently
chide
me
for
be
rude
;
and
,
keep
me
close
to
her
shawl
,
turn
to
thank
the
gentleman
for
take
so
much
trouble
as
to
bring
her
home
.
 
<EOS>
She
put
out
her
hand
to
him
as
she
speak
,
and
,
as
he
meet
it
with
his
own
,
she
glance
,
I
think
,
at
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
let
us
say
"
good
night
"
,
my
fine
boy
,
"
say
the
gentleman
,
when
he
have
bent
his
head
---
I
see
him
!
<EOS>
---
over
my
mother
's
little
glove
.
   
<EOS>
"
good
night
!
"
say
<EOS>
I.
   
"
come
!
 
<EOS>
let
us
be
the
good
friend
in
the
world
!
"
say
the
gentleman
,
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
shake
hand
!
"
   
<EOS>
My
right
hand
be
in
my
mother
's
leave
,
so
I
give
him
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
that
be
the
wrong
hand
,
Davy
!
"
laugh
the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
my
mother
draw
my
right
hand
forward
,
but
I
be
resolve
,
for
my
former
reason
,
not
to
give
it
him
,
and
I
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
him
the
other
,
and
he
shake
it
heartily
,
and
say
I
be
a
brave
fellow
,
and
go
away
.
   
<EOS>
at
this
minute
I
see
him
turn
round
in
the
garden
,
and
give
us
a
last
look
with
his
ill
-
omen
black
eye
,
before
the
door
be
shut
.
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
,
who
have
not
say
a
word
or
move
a
finger
,
secure
the
fastening
instantly
,
and
we
all
go
into
the
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
,
contrary
to
her
usual
habit
,
instead
of
come
to
the
elbow
-
chair
by
the
fire
,
remain
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
and
sit
singe
to
herself
.
   
<EOS>
---
"
hope
you
have
have
a
pleasant
evening

madam

"
say
Peggotty
,
stand
as
stiff
as
a
barrel
in
the
centre
of
the
room
,
with
a
candlestick
in
her
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
much

"
a

return
my
mother
.
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
continue
to
stand
motionless
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
and
my
mother
resume
her
singing
<EOS>
,
I
fall
asleep
,
though
I
be
not
so
sound
asleep
<EOS>
but
that
I
could
hear
voice
,
without
hear
what
they
say
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
half
awake
from
this
uncomfortable
doze
,
I
find
Peggotty
and
my
mother
both
in
tear
,
and
both
talk
.
   
<EOS>
"
not
such
a
one
as
this
,
Mr
Copperfield
would
not
have
like

say
Peggotty
.

"
that
I
say

"
Good

cry
my

,

you

drive

"
God

"
<EOS>
then
,
how
can

say
my
mother
---
"
<EOS>
you
know
I
do
not
mean
how
can
you
dare
,
Peggotty
,
but
how
can
you
have
the
heart

to
make
me
so
uncomfortable

say
such
bitter
thing
to
me
,
when
you
be
well

no

I
think
Peggotty
would
have
throw
the
candlestick
away
,
she
be
so
emphatic
with
it
.

"
how
can
you
be
so
aggravating

say
my
mother
,
shed
more
tear

You

what

I
to

<EOS>
if

it
my

<EOS>
what

I
ask

<EOS>
Would
you

Peggotty

to
take
this

very
much
to

I
think

.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
deny
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
then
,
turn
affectionately
to
me
,
with
her
cheek
against
mine
,
"
be
I
a
naughty
mama
to
you
,
Davy
?
 
<EOS>
be
I
a
nasty
,
cruel
,
selfish
,
bad
mama
?
<EOS>
say
I
be
,
my
child
;
say
"
yes
"
,
dear
boy
,
and
Peggotty
will
love
you
;
and
Peggotty
's
love
be
a
great
deal
better
than
mine
,
Davy
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
love
you
at
all
,
do
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
at
this
,
we
all
fall
a
-
crying
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
be
the
loud
of
the
party
,
but
I
be
sure
we
be
all
sincere
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
quite
heart
-
break
myself
,
and
be
afraid
that
in
the
first
transport
of
wound
tenderness
I
call
Peggotty
a
"
Beast
"
.
 
<EOS>
that
honest
creature
be
in
deep
affliction
,
I
remember
,
and
must
have
become
quite
buttonless
on
the
occasion
;
for
a
little
volley
of
those
explosive
go
off
,
when
,
after
have
make
it
up
with
my
mother
,
she
kneel
down
by
the
elbow
-
chair
,
and
make
it
up
with
me
.
   
<EOS>
We
go
to
bed
greatly
deject
.
 
<EOS>
My
sobs
keep
wake
me
,
for
a
long
time
;
and
when
one
very
strong
sob
quite
hoist
me
up
in
bed
,
I
find
my
mother
sit
on
the
coverlet
,
and
lean
over
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
fall
asleep
in
her
arm
,
after
that
,
and
sleep
soundly
.
   
<EOS>
whether
it
be
the
follow
Sunday
when
I
see
the
gentleman
again
,
or
whether
there
be
any
great
lapse
of
time
before
he
reappear
,
I
can
not
recall
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
profess
to
be
clear
about
date
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
he
be
,
in
church
,
and
he
walk
home
with
us
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
in
,
too
,
to
look
at
a
famous
geranium
we
have
,
in
the
parlour
-
window
.
 
<EOS>
It
do
not
appear
to
me
that
he
take
much
notice
of
it
,
but
before
he
go
he
ask
my
mother
to
give
him
a
bit
of
the
blossom
.
 
<EOS>
She
beg
him
to
choose
it
for
himself
,
but
he
refuse
to
do
that
<EOS>
---
I
could
not
understand
why
---
so
she
pluck
it
for
him
,
and
give
it
into
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
he
would
never
,
never
part
with
it
any
more
;
and
I
think
he
must
be
quite
a
fool
not
to
know
that
it
would
fall
to
piece
in
a
day
or
two
.
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
begin
to
be
less
with
us
,
of
an
evening
,
than
she
have
always
be
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
defer
to
her
very
much
---
more
than
usual
,
it
occur
to
me
---
and
we
be
all
three
excellent
friend
;
still
we
be
different
from
what
we
use
to
be
,
and
be
not
so
comfortable
among
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
I
fancy
that
Peggotty
perhaps
object
to
my
mother
's
wear
all
the
pretty
dress
she
have
in
her
drawer
,
or
to
her
go
so
often
to
visit
at
that
neighbour
be
;
but
I
could
not
,
to
my
satisfaction
,
make
out
how
it
be
.
   
<EOS>
gradually
,
I
become
used
to
see
the
gentleman
with
the
black
whisker
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
him
no
better
than
at
first
,
and
have
the
same
uneasy
jealousy
of
him
;
but
if
I
have
any
reason
for
it
beyond
a
child
's
instinctive
dislike
,
and
a
general
idea
that
Peggotty
and
I
could
make
much
of
my
mother
without
any
help
,
it
certainly
be
not
the
reason
that
I
may
have
find
if
I
have
be
old
.
 
<EOS>
no
such
thing
come
into
my
mind
,
or
near
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
observe
,
in
little
piece
,
as
it
be
;
but
as
to
make
a
net
of
a
number
of
these
piece
,
and
catch
anybody
in
it
,
that
be
,
as
yet
,
beyond
me
.
   
<EOS>
one
autumn
morning
I
be
with
my
mother
in
the
front
garden
,
when
Mr
Murdstone
---
I
know
him
by
that
name
now
---
come
by
,
on
horseback
.
 
<EOS>
He
rein
up
his
horse
to
salute
my
mother
,
and
say
he
be
go
to
Lowestoft
to
see
some
friend
who
be
there
with
a
yacht
,
and
merrily
propose
to
take
me
on
the
saddle
before
him
if
I
would
like
the
ride
.
   
<EOS>
the
air
be
so
clear
and
pleasant
,
and
the
horse
seem
to
like
the
idea
of
the
ride
so
much
himself
,
as
he
stand
snort
and
paw
at
the
garden
-
gate
,
that
I
have
a
great
desire
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
be
send
upstairs
to
Peggotty
to
be
make
spruce
;
and
in
the
meantime
Mr
Murdstone
dismount
,
and
,
with
his
horse
's
bridle
draw
over
his
arm
,
walk
slowly
up
and
down
on
the
outer
side
of
the
sweetbriar
fence
,
while
my
mother
walk
slowly
up
and
down
on
the
inner
to
keep
him
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
recollect
Peggotty
<EOS>
and
I
peep
out
at
them
from
my
little
window
;
I
recollect
how
closely
they
seem
to
be
examine
the
sweetbriar
between
them
,
as
they
stroll
along
;
and
how
,
from
be
in
a
perfectly
angelic
temper
,
Peggotty
turn
cross
in
a
moment
,
and
brush
my
hair
the
wrong
way
,
excessively
hard
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Murdstone
and
I
be
soon
off
,
and
trot
along
on
the
green
turf
by
the
side
of
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
He
hold
me
quite
easily
with
one
arm
,
and
I
do
not
think
I
be
restless
usually
;
but
I
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
sit
in
front
of
him
without
turn
my
head
sometimes
,
and
look
up
in
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
that
kind
of
shallow
black
eye
<EOS>
---
I
want
a
well
word
to
express
an
eye
that
have
no
depth
in
it
to
be
look
into
---
which
,
when
it
be
abstract
,
seem
from
some
peculiarity
of
light
to
be
disfigure
,
for
a
moment
at
a
time
,
by
a
cast
.
 
<EOS>
several
time
when
I
glance
at
him
,
I
observe
that
appearance
with
a
sort
of
awe
,
and
wonder
what
he
be
think
about
so
closely
.
 
<EOS>
His
hair
and
whisker
be
blacker
and
thick
,
look
at
so
near
,
than
even
I
have
give
them
credit
for
be
.
 
<EOS>
a
squareness
about
the
low
part
of
his
face
,
and
the
dotted
indication
of
the
strong
black
beard
he
shave
close
every
day
,
remind
me
of
the
wax
-
work
that
have
travel
into
our
neighbourhood
some
half
-
a
-
year
before
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
his
regular
eyebrow
,
and
the
rich
white
,
and
black
,
and
brown
,
of
his
complexion
---
confound
his
complexion
,
and
his
memory
!
---
make
me
think
him
,
in
spite
of
my
misgiving
,
a
very
handsome
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
that
my
poor
dear
mother
think
him
so
too
.
   
<EOS>
We
go
to
an
hotel
by
the
sea
,
where
two
gentleman
be
smoke
cigar
in
a
room
by
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
each
of
them
be
lie
on
at
least
four
chair
,
and
have
a
large
rough
jacket
on
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
corner
be
a
heap
of
coat
and
boat
-
cloak
,
and
a
flag
,
all
bundle
up
together
.
   
<EOS>
They
both
roll
on
to
their
foot
in
an
untidy
sort
of
manner
,
when
we
come
in
,
and
say
,
"
Halloa
,
Murdstone
!
 
<EOS>
We
think
you
be
dead
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
not
yet
,
"
say
Mr
Murdstone
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
who
be
this
shaver
?
<EOS>
"
say
one
of
the
gentleman
,
take
hold
of
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
Davy
,
"
return
Mr
Murdstone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Davy
who
?
"
say
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jones
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Copperfield
,
"
say
Mr
Murdstone
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
!
 
<EOS>
Bewitching
<EOS>
Mrs
Copperfield
's
encumbrance
?
"
cry
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
pretty
little
widow
?
"
   
"
quinion
,
"
say
Mr
Murdstone
,
"
take
care
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
somebody
's
sharp
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
who
be
?
"
ask
the
gentleman
,
laugh
.
<EOS>
I
look
up
,
quickly
;
be
curious
to
know
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
only
Brooks
of
Sheffield
,
"
say
Mr
Murdstone
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
quite
relieved
to
find
that
it
be
only
Brooks
of
Sheffield
;
for
,
at
first
,
I
really
think
it
be
<EOS>
I.
   
there
seem
to
be
something
very
comical
in
the
reputation
of
Mr
Brooks
of
Sheffield
,
for
both
the
gentleman
laugh
heartily
when
he
be
mention
,
and
Mr
Murdstone
be
a
good
deal
amuse
also
.
<EOS>
after
some
laughing
,
the
gentleman
whom
he
have
call
Quinion
,
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
and
what
be
the
opinion
of
Brooks
of
Sheffield
,
in
reference
to
the
project
business
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
do
not
know
that
Brooks
understand
much
about
it
at
present
,
"
reply
Mr
Murdstone
;
"
but
he
be
not
generally
favourable
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
there
be
more
laughter
at
this
,
and
Mr
Quinion
say
he
would
ring
the
bell
for
some
sherry
in
which
to
drink
to
Brooks
.
 
<EOS>
this
he
do
;
and
when
the
wine
come
,
he
make
me
have
a
little
,
with
a
biscuit
,
and
,
before
I
drink
it
,
stand
up
and
say
,
"
confusion
to
Brooks
of
Sheffield
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
toast
be
receive
with
great
applause
,
and
such
hearty
laughter
that
it
make
me
laugh
too
;
at
which
they
laugh
the
more
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
we
quite
enjoy
ourselves
.
   
<EOS>
We
walk
about
on
the
cliff
after
that
,
and
sit
on
the
grass
,
and
look
at
thing
through
a
telescope
---
I
could
make
out
nothing
myself
when
it
be
put
to
my
eye
,
but
I
pretend
I
could
---
<EOS>
and
then
we
come
back
to
the
hotel
to
an
early
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
time
we
be
out
,
the
two
gentleman
smoke
incessantly
---
which
,
I
think
,
if
I
may
judge
from
the
smell
of
their
rough
coat
,
they
must
have
be
do
,
ever
since
the
coat
have
first
come
home
from
the
tailor
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
not
forget
that
we
go
on
board
the
yacht
,
where
they
all
three
descend
into
the
cabin
,
and
be
busy
with
some
paper
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
them
quite
hard
at
work
,
when
I
look
down
through
the
open
skylight
.
 
<EOS>
They
leave
me
,
during
this
time
,
with
a
very
nice
man
with
a
very
large
head
of
red
hair
and
a
very
small
shiny
hat
upon
it
,
who
have
get
a
cross
-
bar
shirt
or
waistcoat
on
,
with
"
Skylark
"
in
capital
letter
across
the
chest
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
his
name
;
and
that
as
he
live
on
board
ship
and
have
not
a
street
door
to
put
his
name
on
,
he
put
it
there
instead
;
but
when
I
call
him
Mr
Skylark
,
he
say
it
mean
the
vessel
.
   
<EOS>
I
observe
all
day
that
Mr
Murdstone
be
graver
and
steady
than
the
two
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
very
gay
and
careless
.
 
<EOS>
They
joke
freely
with
one
another
,
but
seldom
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
appear
to
me
that
he
be
more
clever
and
cold
than
they
be
,
and
that
they
regard
him
with
something
of
my
own
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
I
remark
that
,
once
or
twice
when
Mr
Quinion
be
talk
,
he
look
at
Mr
Murdstone
sideways
,
as
if
to
make
sure
of
his
not
be
displease
;
and
that
once
when
Mr
Passnidge
(
the
other
gentleman
)
be
in
high
spirit
,
he
tread
upon
his
foot
,
and
give
him
a
secret
caution
with
his
eye
,
to
observe
Mr
Murdstone
,
who
be
sit
stern
and
silent
.
 
<EOS>
nor
do
I
recollect
that
Mr
Murdstone
laugh
at
all
that
day
,
except
at
the
Sheffield
joke
---
and
that
,
by
the
by
,
be
his
own
.
   
<EOS>
We
go
home
early
in
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
fine
evening
,
and
my
mother
<EOS>
and
he
have
another
stroll
by
the
sweetbriar
,
while
I
be
send
in
to
get
my
tea
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
go
,
my
mother
ask
me
all
about
the
day
I
have
have
,
and
what
they
have
say
and
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
mention
what
they
have
say
about
her
,
and
she
laugh
,
and
tell
me
they
be
impudent
fellow
who
talk
nonsense
---
<EOS>
but
I
know
it
please
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
quite
as
well
as
I
know
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
the
opportunity
of
ask
if
she
be
at
all
acquaint
with
Mr
Brooks
of
Sheffield
,
but
she
answer
no
,
only
she
suppose
he
must
be
a
manufacturer
in
the
knife
and
fork
way
.
   
<EOS>
Can
I
say
of
her
face
---
alter
as
I
have
reason
to
remember
it
,
perish
as
I
know
it
be
---
that
it
be
go
,
when
here
it
come
before
me
at
this
instant
,
as
distinct
as
any
face
that
I
may
choose
to
look
on
in
a
crowded
street
?
 
<EOS>
Can
I
say
of
her
innocent
and
girlish
beauty
,
that
it
fade
,
and
be
no
more
,
when
its
breath
fall
on
my
cheek
now
,
as
it
fall
that
night
?
 
<EOS>
Can
I
say
she
ever
change
,
when
my
remembrance
bring
her
back
to
life
,
thus
only
;
and
,
truer
to
its
love
youth
than
I
have
be
,
or
man
ever
be
,
still
hold
fast
what
it
cherish
then
?
   
<EOS>
I
write
of
her
just
as
she
be
when
I
have
go
to
bed
after
this
talk
,
and
she
come
to
bid
me
good
night
.
 
<EOS>
She
kneel
down
playfully
by
the
side
of
the
bed
,
and
lay
her
chin
upon
her
hand
,
and
laughing
,
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
what
be
it
<EOS>
they
say
,
Davy
?
 
<EOS>

we

one
another
over

over
again

I
soon

fast
asleep

It
seem
to
me
,
at

distance
of
time

as
if
it
be
the
next
day

Peggotty
broach
the
striking

adventurous
proposition

I
be
about
to

it
be
probably
about
two
month
afterwards

<EOS>
We
be
sit
as
before

one
evening
(
when
my

be
out
as
before
)
,
in
company
with
the
stocking
and
the
yard
-
measure
,
and
the
bit
of
wax
,
and
the
box
with
St

's
on
the
lid
,
and
the
crocodile
book
,
when
Peggotty
,
after
look
at
me
several
time
,
and
open
her
mouth
as
if
she
be
go
to
speak
,
without
do
it
---
which
I
think
be
merely
gape
,
or
I
should
have
be
rather
alarm
---
say
coaxingly
:
   
"
<EOS>
Master
Davy
,
how
should
you
like

along
with
me

Peggotty

up

then

Peggotty

she
speak
of
him
as
a
morsel
of
English
Grammar

<EOS>
I
be
flush
by
her
summary
of
delight
,
and
reply
that
it
would
indeed
be
a
treat
,
but
what
would
my

say
?
   
<EOS>
"
why
then
I
will
as
good
as

Peggotty

intent

I

put
my

elbow
on

argue
the
point

"
She

<EOS>
if
Peggotty
be
look
for
a
hole

all
of
a
sudden
,
in
the
heel
of
that
stocking
,
it
must
have
be
a
very
little
one
indeed
,
and
not
worth

I
say
!

say
Peggotty

look
at
me
again
at
last

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
not
you
know
?
 
<EOS>
She
be
go
to
stay
for
a
fortnight
with
Mrs
Grayper
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Grayper
be
go
to
have
a
lot
of
company
.
"
   
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
if
that
be
it
,
I
be
quite
ready
to
go

<EOS>
I
wait
,
in
the
utmost
impatience
,
until
my
mother
come
home
from
Mrs
Grayper
's
<EOS>
(
for
it
be
that
identical
neighbour
)
,
to
ascertain
if
we
could
get
leave
to
carry
out
this
great
idea
.
 
<EOS>
without
be
nearly
so
much
surprised
as
I
have
expect
,
my
mother
enter
into
it
readily
;
and
it
be
all
arrange
that
night
,
and
my
board
and
lodging
during
the
visit
be
to
be
pay
for
.
   
<EOS>
the
day
soon
come
for
our
going
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
such
an
early
day
that
it
come
soon
,
even
to
me
,
who
be
in
a
fever
of
expectation
,
and
half
afraid
that
an
earthquake
or
a
fiery
mountain
,
or
some
other
great
convulsion
of
nature
,
may
interpose
to
stop
the
expedition
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
to
go
in
a
carrier
's
cart
,
which
depart
in
the
morning
after
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
give
any
money
to
have
be
allow
to
wrap
myself
up
over
-
night
,
and
sleep
in
my
hat
and
boot
.
   
<EOS>
It
touch
me
nearly
now
,
although
I
tell
it
lightly
,
to
recollect
how
eager
I
be
to
leave
my
happy
home
;
to
think
how
little
I
suspect
what
I
do
leave
for
ever
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
recollect
that
when
the
carrier
's
cart
be
at
the
gate
,
and
my
mother
stand
there
kiss
me
,
a
grateful
fondness
for
her
and
for
the
old
place
<EOS>
I
have
never
turn
my
back
upon
before
,
make
me
cry
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
know
that
my
mother
cry
too
,
and
that
I
feel
her
heart
beat
against
mine
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
recollect
that
when
the
carrier
begin
to
move
,
my
mother
run
out
at
the
gate
,
and
call
to
him
to
stop
,
that
she
may
kiss
me
once
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
dwell
upon
the
earnestness
and
love
with
which
she
lift
up
her
face
to
mine
,
and
do
so
.
   
<EOS>
as
we
leave
her
standing
in
the
road
,
Mr
Murdstone
come
up
to
where
she
be
,
and
seem
to
expostulate
with
her
for
be
so
move
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
look
back
round
the
awning
of
the
cart
,
and
wonder
what
business
it
be
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
,
who
be
also
look
back
on
the
other
side
,
seem
anything
but
satisfied
;
as
the
face
she
bring
back
in
the
cart
denote
.
   
<EOS>
I
sit
look
at
Peggotty
for
some
time
,
in
a
reverie
on
this
supposititious
case
:
whether
,
if
she
be
employ
to
lose
me
like
the
boy
in
the
fairy
tale
,
I
should
be
able
to
track
my
way
home
again
by
the
button
she
would
shed
.

Chapter
3
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
change
 
<EOS>
the
carrier
's
horse
be
the
lazy
horse
in
the
world
,
I
should
hope
,
and
shuffle
along
,
with
his
head
down
,
as
if
he
like
to
keep
people
wait
to
whom
the
package
be
direct
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
,
indeed
,
that
he
sometimes
chuckle
audibly
over
this
reflection
,
but
the
carrier
say
he
be
only
troubled
with
a
cough
.
<EOS>
the
carrier
have
a
way
of
keep
his
head
down
,
like
his
horse
,
and
of
droop
sleepily
forward
as
he
drive
,
with
one
of
his
arm
on
each
of
his
knee
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
"
drive
"
,
but
it
strike
me
that
the
cart
would
have
go
to
Yarmouth
quite
as
well
without
him
,
for
the
horse
<EOS>
do
all
that
;
and
as
to
conversation
,
he
have
no
idea
of
it
but
whistle
.
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
have
a
basket
of
refreshment
on
her
knee
,
which
would
have
last
us
out
handsomely
,
if
we
have
be
go
to
London
by
the
same
conveyance
.
 
<EOS>
We
eat
a
good
deal
,
and
sleep
a
good
deal
.
<EOS>
Peggotty
always
go
to
sleep
with
her
chin
upon
the
handle
of
the
basket
,
her
hold
of
which
never
relaxed
;
and
I
could
not
have
believe
unless
I
have
hear
her
do
it
,
that
one
defenceless
woman
could
have
snore
so
much
.
   
<EOS>
We
make
so
many
deviation
up
and
down
lane
,
and
be
such
a
long
time
deliver
a
bedstead
at
a
public
-
house
,
and
call
at
other
place
,
that
I
be
quite
tired
,
and
very
glad
,
when
we
see
Yarmouth
.
 
<EOS>
It
look
rather
spongy
and
soppy
,
I
think
,
as
I
carry
my
eye
over
the
great
dull
waste
that
lie
across
the
river
;
and
I
could
not
help
wonder
,
if
the
world
be
really
as
round
as
my
geography
book
say
,
how
any
part
of
it
come
to
be
so
flat
.
<EOS>
but
I
reflect
that
Yarmouth
may
be
situate
at
one
of
the
pole
;
which
would
account
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
as
we
draw
a
little
nearer
,
and
see
the
whole
adjacent
prospect
lie
a
straight
low
line
under
the
sky
,
I
hint
to
Peggotty
that
a
mound
or
so
may
have
improve
it
;
and
also
that
if
the
land
have
be
a
little
more
separated
from
the
sea
,
and
the
town
and
the
tide
have
not
be
quite
so
much
mixed
up
,
like
toast
and
water
,
it
would
have
be
nice
.
 
<EOS>
but
Peggotty
say
,
with
great
emphasis
than
usual
,
that
we
must
take
thing
as
we
find
them
,
and
that
,
for
her
part
,
she
be
proud
to
call
herself
a
Yarmouth
Bloater
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
get
into
the
street
(
which
be
strange
enough
to
me
)
and
smell
the
fish
,
and
pitch
,
and
oakum
,
and
tar
,
and
see
the
sailor
walk
about
,
and
the
cart
jingle
up
and
down
over
the
stone
<EOS>
,
I
feel
that
I
have
do
so
busy
a
place
an
injustice
;
and
say
as
much
to
Peggotty
,
who
hear
my
expression
of
delight
with
great
complacency
,
and
tell
me
it
be
well
know
(
I
suppose
to
those
who
have
the
good
fortune
to
be
bear
bloater
)
that
Yarmouth
be
,
upon
the
whole
,
the
fine
place
in
the
universe
.
   
<EOS>

<EOS>
He
be
wait
for
us
,
in
fact
,
at
the
public
-
house
;
and
ask
me
how
I
find
myself
,
like
an
old
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
feel
,
at
first
,
that
I
know
him
as
well
as
he
know
me
,
because
he
have
never
come
to
our
house
since
the
night
I
be
bear
,
and
naturally
he
have
the
advantage
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
our
intimacy
be
much
advance
by
his
take
me
on
his
back
to
carry
me
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
,
now
,
a
huge
,
strong
fellow
of
six
foot
high
,
broad
in
proportion
,
and
round
-
shoulder
;
but
with
a
simper
boy
's
face
and
curly
light
hair
that
give
him
quite
a
sheepish
look
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
dress
in
a
canvas
jacket
,
and
a
pair
of
such
very
stiff
trouser
that
they
would
have
stand
quite
as
well
alone
,
without
any
leg
in
them
.
<EOS>
and
you
could
not
so
properly
have
say
he
wear
a
hat
,
as
that
he
be
cover
in
a
-
top
,
like
an
old
building
,
with
something
pitchy
.
   
<EOS>

no

there
be

of

off

high

dry
on

with
an

out

all

I
suppose
I
could
not

there

cut
in

it
be
roof
in

there
be

window
in

the
wonderful
charm
of
it
be
,
that
it
be
a
real

which
have
no

be
upon
the

hundred
of

it
small

lonely

never

it

<EOS>
there

<EOS>
all

in

like

accord
to
my
theory
---
and
then
Peggotty
open
a
little
door
and
show
me
my
bedroom
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
<EOS>
the
complete
and
most
desirable
bedroom
ever
see
<EOS>
---
in
the
stern
of
the
vessel
;
with
a
little
window
,
where
the
rudder

a

just

nail

and
frame
with
oyster

there
be
just
room

and
a

in
a

on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
the
wall
be
whitewash
as
white
as
milk
,
and
the
patchwork
counterpane
make
my
eye
quite
ache
with
its
brightness
.
 
<EOS>
one
thing
I
particularly
notice
in
this
delightful
house
,
be
the
smell
of
fish
;
which
be
so
search
,
that
when
I
take
out
my
pocket
-
handkerchief
to
wipe
my
nose
,
I
find
it
smelt
exactly
as
if
it
have
wrap
up
a
lobster
.
 
<EOS>
on
my
impart
this
discovery
in
confidence
to
Peggotty
,
she
inform
me
that
her
brother
deal
in
lobster
,
crabs
,
and
crawfish
;
and
I
afterwards
find
that
a
heap
of
these
creature
,
in
a
state
of
wonderful
conglomeration
with
one
another
,
and
never
leave
off
pinch
whatever
they
lay
hold
of
,
be
usually
to
be
find
in
a
little
wooden
outhouse
where
the
pot
and
kettle
be
keep
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
welcome
by
a
very
civil
woman
in
a
white
apron
,
whom
I
have
see
curtseying
at
the
door
when
I
be
on
Ham
's
back
,
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
.
 
<EOS>
likewise
by
a
most
beautiful
little
girl
<EOS>
(
or
I
think
her
so
)
with
a
necklace
of
blue
bead
on
,
who
would
not
let
me
kiss
her
when
I
offer
to
,
but
run
away
and
hide
herself
.
 
<EOS>
by
and
by
,
when
we
have
dine
in
a
sumptuous
manner
off
boil
dab
,
melted
butter

good

natured
face
come
home
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
call
Peggotty
"
Lass
"
,
and
give
her
a
hearty
smack
on
the
cheek
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
from
the
general
propriety
of
her
conduct
,
that
he
be
her
brother
;
and
so
he
turn
out
---
<EOS>
be
presently
introduce
to
me
as
Mr
Peggotty
,
the
master
of
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
"
glad
to
see
you

"
say
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
us
rough
,
sir
,
but
you
will
find
us
ready

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
thank
him
,
and
reply
that
I
be
sure
I
should
be
happy
in
such
a
delightful
place
.
   
<EOS>
"
how
be
your
Ma
,
sir
?
"
say
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
leave
her
pretty
jolly
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
give
Mr
Peggotty
to
understand
that
she
be
as
jolly
as
I
could
wish
,
and
that
she
desire
her
compliment
---
which
be
a
polite
fiction
on
my
part
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
much
obleeged
to
her
,
I
be
sure
,
"
say
Mr
Peggotty

<EOS>
"
well

Ham

<EOS>
little

"
   
<EOS>
have
do
the
honour
of
his
house
in
this
hospitable
manner
,
Mr
Peggotty
go
out
to
wash
himself
in
a
kettleful
of
hot
water
,
remark
that
"
cold
would
never
get
his
muck
off
"
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
return
,
greatly
improve
in
appearance
;
but
so
rubicund
,
that
I
could
not
help
think
his
face
have
this
in
common
with
the
lobster
,
crabs
,
and
crawfish
,
---
that
it
go
into
the
hot
water
very
black
,
and
come
out
very
red
.
   
<EOS>
after
tea
,
when
the
door
be
shut
and
all
be
make
snug
(
the
night
be
cold
and
misty
now
)
,
it
seem
to
me
the
most
delicious
retreat
that
the
imagination
of
man
could
conceive
.
 
<EOS>
to
hear
the
wind
get
up
out
at
sea
,
to
know
that
the
fog
be
creep
over
the
desolate
flat
outside
,
and
to
look
at
the
fire
,
and
think
that
there
be
no
house
near
but
this
one
,
and
this
one
a
boat
,
be
like
enchantment
.
 
<EOS>
little
Em'ly
have
overcome
her
shyness
,
and
be
sit
by
my
side
upon
the
low
and
least
of
the
locker
,
which
be
just
large
enough
for
us
two
,
and
just
fit
into
the
chimney
corner
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Peggotty
with
the
white
apron
,
be
knit
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
at
her
needlework
be
as
much
at
home
with
St
Paul
's
and
the
bit
of
wax
-
candle
,
as
if
they
have
never
know
any
other
roof
.
 
<EOS>
Ham
,
who
have
be
give
me
my
first
lesson
in
all
-
four
,
be
try
to
recollect
a
scheme
of
tell
fortune
with
the
dirty
card
,
and
be
print
off
fishy
impression
of
his
thumb
on
all
the
card
he
turn
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
be
smoke
his
pipe
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
it
be
a
time
for
conversation
and
confidence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Peggotty
!
<EOS>
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
he
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
give
your
son
the
name
of
Ham
,
because
you
live
in
a
sort
of
ark
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
seem
to
think
it
a
deep
idea
,
but
answer
:
   
"
<EOS>
no
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
giv
him
no
name
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
who
give
him
that
name
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
say
I
,
put
question
number
two
of
the
catechism
to
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
sir
,
his
father
giv
it
him
,
"
say
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
be
his
father
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
brother
Joe
be
his
father
,
"
say
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
dead
,
Mr
Peggotty
?
<EOS>
"
I
hint
,
after
a
respectful
pause
.
   
<EOS>
"
drowndead
,
"
say
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
surprised
that
Mr
Peggotty
be
not
Ham
's
father
,
and
begin
to
wonder
whether
I
be
mistaken
about
his
relationship
to
anybody
else
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
curious
to
know
,
that
I
make
up
my
mind
to
have
it
out
with
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
little
Em'ly
,
"
I
say
,
glance
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
your
daughter
,
be
not
she
,
Mr
Peggotty
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
My
brother
-
in
-
law
,
Tom
,
be
her
father
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
---
dead
,
Mr
Peggotty
?
<EOS>
"
I
hint
,
after
another
respectful
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
drowndead
,
"
say
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
I
feel
the
difficulty
of
resume
the
subject
,
but
have
not
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
yet
,
and
must
get
to
the
bottom
somehow
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
have
not
you
any
child
,
Mr
Peggotty
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
master
,
"
he
answer
with
a
short
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
a
bacheldore
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
a
bachelor
!
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
astonish
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
who
be
that
,
Mr
Peggotty
?
"
<EOS>
point
to
the
person
in
the
apron
who
be
knit
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
Missis
Gummidge
,
"
say
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gummidge
,
Mr
Peggotty
?
"
   
<EOS>
but
at
this
point
Peggotty
---
I
mean
my
own
peculiar
Peggotty
---
make
such
impressive
motion
to
me
not
to
ask
any
more
question
,
that
I
could
only
sit
and
look
at
all
the
silent
company
,
until
it
be
time
to
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
in
the
privacy
of
my
own
little
cabin
,
she
inform
me
that
Ham
and
Em'ly
be
an
orphan
nephew
and
niece
,
whom
my
host
have
at
different
time
adopt
in
their
childhood
,
when
they
be
leave
destitute
:
and
that
Mrs
Gummidge
be
the
widow
of
his
partner
in
a
boat
,
who
have
die
very
poor
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
but
<EOS>
a
poor
man
himself
,
say
Peggotty
,
but
as
good
as
gold
and
as
true
as
steel
---
those
be
her
simile
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
subject
,
she
inform
me
,
on
which
he
ever
show
a
violent
temper
or
swear
an
oath
,
be
this
generosity
of
his
;
and
if
it
be
ever
refer
to
,
by
any
one
of
them
,
he
strike
the
table
a
heavy
blow
with
his
right
hand
(
have
split
it
on
one
such
occasion
)
,
and
swear
a
dreadful
oath
that
he
would
be
"
Gormed
"
if
he
do
not
cut
and
run
for
good
,
if
it
be
ever
mention
again
.
 
<EOS>
It
appear
,
in
answer
to
my
inquiry
,
that
nobody
have
the
least
idea
of
the
etymology
of
this
terrible
verb
passive
to
be
gormed
;
but
that
they
all
regard
it
as
constitute
a
most
solemn
imprecation
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
very
sensible
of
my
entertainer
's
goodness
,
and
listen
to
the
woman
's
go
to
bed
in
another
little
crib
like
mine
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
boat
,
and
to
him
and
Ham
hang
up
two
hammock
for
themselves
on
the
hook
I
have
notice
in
the
roof
,
in
a
very
luxurious
state
of
mind
,
enhance
by
my
be
sleepy
.
 
<EOS>
as
slumber
gradually
steal
upon
me
,
I
hear
the
wind
howl
out
at
sea
and
come
on
across
the
flat
so
fiercely
,
that
I
have
a
lazy
apprehension
of
the
great
deep
rise
in
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
bethink
myself
that
I
be
in
a
boat
,
after
all
;
and
that
a
man
like
Mr
Peggotty
be
not
a
bad
person
to
have
on
board
if
anything
do
happen
.
   
<EOS>
nothing
happen
,
however
,
bad
than
morning
.
 
<EOS>
almost
as
soon
as
it
shine
upon
the
oyster
-
shell
frame
of
my
mirror
I
be
out
of
bed
,
and
out
with
little
em'ly
,
pick
up
stone
upon
the
beach
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
quite
a
sailor
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
to
Em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
I
suppose
anything
of
the
kind
,
but
I
feel
it
an
act
of
gallantry
to
say
something
;
and
a
shine
sail
close
to
us
make
such
a
pretty
little
image
of
itself
,
at
the
moment
,
in
her
bright
eye
,
that
it
come
into
my
head
to
say
this
.
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
reply
Em'ly
,
shake
her
head
,
"
I
be
afraid
of
the
sea
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
afraid
!
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
with
a
become
air
of
boldness
,
and
look
very
big
at
the
mighty
ocean
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
an't
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
but
it
be
cruel
,
"
say
Em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
see
it
very
cruel
to
some
of
our
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
it
tear
a
boat
as
big
as
our
house
,
all
to
piece
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
be
not
the
boat
<EOS>
that
---
"
   
"
that
father
be
drownde
in
?
"
say
Em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
 
<EOS>
not
that
one
,
I
never
see
that
boat
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
nor
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
her
.
   
<EOS>
little
Em'ly
shake
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
to
remember
!
"
   
<EOS>
here
be
a
coincidence
!
 
<EOS>
I
immediately
go
into
an
explanation
how
I
have
never
see
my
own
father
;
and
how
my
mother
and
I
have
always
live
by
ourselves
in
the
happy
state
imaginable
,
and
live
so
then
,
and
always
mean
to
live
so
;
and
how
my
father
's
grave
be
in
the
churchyard
near
our
house
,
and
shade
by
a
tree
,
beneath
the
bough
of
which
I
have
walk
and
hear
the
bird
sing
many
a
pleasant
morning
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
some
difference
between
Em'ly
's
orphanhood
and
mine
,
it
appear
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
lose
her
mother
before
her
father
;
and
where
her
father
's
grave
be
no
one
know
,
except
that
it
be
somewhere
in
the
depth
of
the
sea
.
   
<EOS>
"
besides
,
"
say
Em'ly
,

yes

good

I

good

Em'ly

if
I
be

a

a

"
   
<EOS>
I
say
I
have
no
doubt
that
Mr
Peggotty
well
deserve
these
treasure
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
acknowledge
that
I
feel
it
difficult
to
picture
him
quite
at
his
ease
in
the
raiment
propose
for
him
by
his
grateful
little
niece
,
and
that
I
be
particularly
doubtful
of
the
policy
of
the
cocked
hat
;
but
I
keep
these
sentiment
to
myself
.
   
<EOS>
little
Em'ly
have
stop
and
look
up
at
the
sky
in
her
enumeration
of
these
article
,
as
if
they
be
a
glorious
vision
.
<EOS>
We
go
on
again
,
pick
up
shell
and
pebble
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
would
like
to
be
a
lady
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
   
<EOS>
Emily
look
at
me
,
and
laugh
and
nod
"
yes
"
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
it
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
We
would
all
be
gentlefolk
together
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
Me
,
and
uncle
,
and
Ham
,
and
Mrs
Gummidge
.
 
<EOS>
We
would
not
mind
then
,
when
there
come
stormy
weather
.
 
<EOS>
---
not
for
our
own
sake
,
I
mean
.
 
<EOS>
We
would
for
the
poor
fisherman
's
,
to
be
sure
,
and
we
would
help
'em
with
money
when
they
come
to
any
hurt
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
seem
to
me
to
be
a
very
satisfactory
and
therefore
not
at
all
improbable
picture
.
<EOS>
I
express
my
pleasure
in
the
contemplation
of
it
,
and
little
Em'ly
be
embolden
to
say
,
shyly
,
   
"
do
not
you
think
you
be
afraid
of
the
sea
,
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
quiet
enough
to
reassure
me
,
but
I
have
no
doubt
if
I
have
see
a
moderately
large
wave
come
tumble
in
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
take
to
my
heel
,
with
an
awful
recollection
of
her
drowned
relation
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
say
"
no
,
"
and
I
add
,
"
You
do
not
seem
to
be
either
,
though
you
say
you
be
,
"
---
for
she
be
walk
much
too
near
the
brink
of
a
sort
of
old
jetty
or
wooden
causeway
we
have
stroll
upon
,
and
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
of
her
fall
over
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
afraid
in
this
way
,
"
say
little
Em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
wake
when
it
blow
,
and
tremble
to
think
of
Uncle
Dan
and
Ham
and
believe
I
hear
'em
cry
out
for
help
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
why
I
should
like
so
much
to
be
a
lady
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
afraid
in
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
not
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
look
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
start
from
my
side
,
and
run
along
a
jagged
timber
which
protrude
from
the
place
we
stand
upon
,
and
overhang
the
deep
water
at
some
height
,
without
the
least
defence
.
 
<EOS>
the
incident
be
so
impressed
on
my
remembrance
,
that
if
I
be
a
draughtsman
I
could
draw
its
form
here
,
I
dare
say
,
accurately
as
it
be
that
day
,
and
little
em'ly
spring
forward
to
her
destruction
(
as
it
appear
to
me
)
,
with
a
look
that
I
have
never
forget
,
direct
far
out
to
sea
.
   
<EOS>
the
light
,
bold
,
flutter
little
figure
turn
and
come
back
safe
to
me
,
and
I
soon
laugh
at
my
fear
,
and
at
the
cry
I
have
utter
;
fruitlessly
in
any
case
,
for
there
be
no
one
near
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
have
be
time
since
,
in
my
manhood
,
many
time
there
have
be
,
when
I
have
think
<EOS>
,
be
it
possible
,
among
the
possibility
of
hide
thing
,
that
in
the
sudden
rashness
of
the
child
and
her
wild
look
so
far
off
,
there
be
any
merciful
attraction
of
her
into
danger
,
any
tempt
her
towards
him
permit
on
the
part
of
her
dead
father
,
that
her
life
may
have
a
chance
of
end
that
day
?
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
time
since
when
I
have
wonder
whether
,
if
the
life
before
her
could
have
be
reveal
to
me
at
a
glance
,
and
so
reveal
as
that
a
child
could
fully
comprehend
it
,
and
if
her
preservation
could
have
depend
on
a
motion
of
my
hand
,
I
ought
to
have
hold
it
up
to
save
her
.
 
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
time
since
---
I
do
not
say
it
last
long
,
but
it
have
be
---
when
I
have
ask
myself
the
question
,
would
it
have
be
well
for
little
em'ly
to
have
have
the
water
close
above
her
head
that
morning
in
my
sight
;
and
when
I
have
answer
yes
,
it
would
have
be
.
   
<EOS>
this
may
be
premature
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
set
it
down
too
soon
,
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
but
let
it
stand
.
   
<EOS>
We
stroll
a
long
way
,
and
load
ourselves
with
thing
that
we
think
curious
,
and
put
some
strand
starfish
carefully
back
into
the
water
---
I
hardly
know
enough
of
the
race
at
this
moment
to
be
quite
certain
whether
they
have
reason
to
feel
obliged
to
us
for
do
so
,
or
the
reverse
---
and
then
make
our
way
home
to
Mr
Peggotty
's
dwelling
.
 
<EOS>
We
stop
under
the
lee
of
the
lobster
-
outhouse
to
exchange
an
innocent
kiss
,
and
go
in
to
breakfast
glow
with
health
and
pleasure
.
   
<EOS>
"
like
two
young
mavishe
,
"
Mr
Peggotty
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
this
mean
,
in
our
local
dialect
,
like
two
young
thrush
,
and
receive
it
as
a
compliment
.
   
<EOS>
of
course
I
be
in
love
with
little
em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
love
that
baby
quite
as
truly
,
quite
as
tenderly
,
with
great
purity
and
more
disinterestedness
,
than
can
enter
into
the
good
love
of
a
later
time
of
life
,
high
and
ennobling
as
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
my
fancy
raise
up
something
round
that
blue
-
eyed
mite
of
a
child
,
which
etherealize
,
and
make
a
very
angel
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
if
,
any
sunny
forenoon
,
she
have
spread
a
little
pair
of
wing
and
fly
away
before
my
eye
,
I
do
not
think
I
should
have
regard
it
as
much
more
than
I
have
have
reason
to
expect
.
   
<EOS>
We
use
to
walk
about
that
dim
old
flat
at
Yarmouth
in
a
loving
manner
,
hour
and
hour
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
sport
by
us
,
as
if
Time
have
not
grow
up
himself
yet
,
but
be
a
child
too
,
and
always
at
play
.
<EOS>
I
tell
Em'ly
I
adore
her
,
and
that
unless
she
confess
she
adore
me
<EOS>
I
should
be
reduce
to
the
necessity
of
kill
myself
with
a
sword
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
she
do
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
she
do
.
   
<EOS>
as
to
any
sense
of
inequality
,
or
youthfulness
,
or
other
difficulty
in
our
way
,
little
em'ly
<EOS>
and
I
have
no
such
trouble
,
because
we
have
no
future
.
 
<EOS>
We
make
no
more
provision
for
grow
old
,
than
we
do
for
grow
young
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
the
admiration
of
Mrs
Gummidge
and
Peggotty
,
who
use
to
whisper
of
an
evening
when
we
sit
,
lovingly
,
on
our
little
locker
side
by
side
,
"
Lor
!
<EOS>
be
not
it
beautiful
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
smile
at
us
from
behind
his
pipe
,
and
Ham
grin
all
the
evening
and
do
nothing
else
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
something
of
the
sort
of
pleasure
in
us
,
I
suppose
,
that
they
may
have
have
in
a
pretty
toy
,
or
a
pocket
model
of
the
Colosseum
.
   
<EOS>
I
soon
find
out
that
Mrs
Gummidge
do
not
always
make
herself
so
agreeable
as
she
may
have
be
expect
to
do
,
under
the
circumstance
of
her
residence
with
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
's
be
rather
a
fretful
disposition
,
and
she
whimper
more
sometimes
than
be
comfortable
for
other
party
in
so
small
an
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
sorry
for
her
;
but
there
be
moment
when
it
would
have
be
more
agreeable
,
I
think
,
if
Mrs
Gummidge
have
have
a
convenient
apartment
of
her
own
to
retire
to
,
and
have
stop
there
until
her
spirit
revive
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
go
occasionally
to
a
public
-
house
call
the
Willing
Mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
discover
this
,
by
his
be
out
on
the
second
or
third
evening
of
our
visit
,
and
by
Mrs
Gummidge
be
look
up
at
the
dutch
clock
,
between
eight
and
nine
,
and
say
he
be
there
,
and
that
,
what
be
more
,
she
have
know
in
the
morning
he
would
go
there
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
have
be
in
a
low
state
all
day
,
and
have
burst
into
tear
in
the
forenoon
,
when
the
fire
smoke
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
a
lone
lorn
creetur
'
,
"
be
Mrs
Gummidge
's
word
,
when
that
unpleasant
occurrence
take
place
,
"
and
everythink
go
contrary
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
it
will
soon
leave
off
,
"
say
Peggotty
<EOS>
---
I
again
mean
our
Peggotty
---
"
and
besides
,
you
know
,
it
be
not
more
disagreeable
to
you
than
to
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
feel
it
more
,
"
say
Mrs
Gummidge
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
cold
day
,
with
cut
blast
of
wind
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
's
peculiar
corner
of
the
fireside
seem
to
me
to
be
the
warm
and
snug
in
the
place
,
as
her
chair
be
certainly
the
easy
,
but
it
do
not
suit
her
that
day
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
constantly
complain
of
the
cold
,
and
of
its
occasion
a
visitation
in
her
back
<EOS>
which
she
call
"
the
creeps
"
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
she
shed
tear
on
that
subject
,
and
say
again
that
she
be
"
a
lone
lorn
creetur
'
and
everythink
go
contrary
with
her
"
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
certainly
very
cold
,
"
say
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
everybody
must
feel
it
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
feel
it
more
than
other
people
,
"
say
Mrs
Gummidge
.
   
<EOS>
so
at
dinner
;
when
Mrs
Gummidge
be
always
help
immediately
after
me
,
to
whom
the
preference
be
give
as
a
visitor
of
distinction
.
 
<EOS>
the
fish
be
small
and
bony
,
and
the
potato
be
a
little
burn
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
acknowledge
that
we
feel
this
something
of
a
disappointment
;
but
Mrs
Gummidge
say
she
feel
it
more
than
we
do
,
and
shed
tear
again
,
and
make
that
former
declaration
with
great
bitterness
.
   
<EOS>
accordingly
,
when
Mr
Peggotty
come
home
about
nine
o'clock
,
this
unfortunate
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
be
knit
in
her
corner
,
in
a
very
wretched
and
miserable
condition

<EOS>
Peggotty
have
be

<EOS>
Ham
have
be

great
pair
of
waterboot

and
I
,
with
little
em'ly
by
my
side
,
have
be
read
to
them
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
have
never
make
any
other
remark
than
a
forlorn
sigh
,
and
have
never
raise
her
eye
since
tea
.
   
<EOS>
"
well

Mates

"
say
Mr
Peggotty
,
take
his
seat
,
"
and
how

"
   
<EOS>
We
all
say
something
,
or
look
something
,
to
welcome
him
,
except
Mrs

,
who
only
shake
her
head
over

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
Mrs

She
take
out

"
   
<EOS>
I
really
could
not
help
think
,
as
I
sit
take
in
all
this
,
that
the
misfortune
extend
to
some
other
member
of
that
family
besides
Mrs
Gummidge
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mr
Peggotty
make
no
such
retort
,
only
answer
with
another
entreaty
to
Mrs
Gummidge
to
cheer
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
an't
what
I
could
wish
myself
to
be

"
say
Mrs
Gummidge
.
 
<EOS>
"
I

I

<EOS>
My

<EOS>
I
feel
my

they
make

<EOS>
I

I
do

<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
be
harden
to
'em

but
<EOS>
I
an't
.
<EOS>
I
make
the
house
uncomfortable

<EOS>
I
do
not
wonder
at
it

<EOS>
I
have
make
your
sister
so
all
day
,
and
Master
Davy

"
   
<EOS>
here
I
be
suddenly
melted

roar
out
,

<EOS>
no

Mrs
Gummidge

in
great
mental
distress

It
be
far
from
right
that
I
should
do
it

say
Mrs
Gummidge
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
an't
a
fit
return

<EOS>
I
have
better
go
into
the
house

die

I
be

have
much
well
not

if

Dan'l
,
I
would
better
go
into

"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
retire
with
these
word
,
and
betook
herself
to
bed
.
<EOS>
when
she
be
go
,
Mr
Peggotty
,
who
have
not
exhibit
a
trace
of
any
feeling
but
the
profound
sympathy
,
look
round
upon
us
,
and
nod
his
head
with
a
lively
expression
of
that
sentiment
still
animate
his
face
,
say
in
a
whisper
:
   
<EOS>
"
She
be
be
think
of
the
old
'
un
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
quite
understand
what
old
one
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
be
suppose
to
have
fix
her
mind
upon
,
until
Peggotty
,
on
see
me
to
bed
,
explain
that
it
be
the
late
Mr
Gummidge
;
and
that
her
brother
always
take
that
for
a
receive
truth
on
such
occasion
,
and
that
it
always
have
a
moving
effect
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
some
time
after
he
be
in
his
hammock
that
night
,
I
hear
him
myself
repeat
to
Ham
,
"
poor
thing
!
 
<EOS>
She
be
be
think
of
the
old
'
un
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
whenever
Mrs
Gummidge
be
overcome
in
a
similar
manner
during
the
remainder
of
our
stay
(
which
happen
some
few
time
)
,
he
always
say
the
same
thing
in
extenuation
of
the
circumstance
,
and
always
with
the
tender
commiseration
.
   
<EOS>
so
the
fortnight
slip
away
,
vary
by
nothing
but
the
variation
of
the
tide
,
which
alter
Mr
Peggotty
's
time
of
go
out
and
come
in
,
and
alter
Ham
's
engagement
also
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
latter
be
unemployed
,
he
sometimes
walk
with
us
to
show
us
the
boat
and
ship
,
and
once
or
twice
he
take
us
for
a
row
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
why
one
slight
set
of
impression
should
be
more
particularly
associate
with
a
place
than
another
,
though
I
believe
this
obtain
with
most
people
,
in
reference
especially
to
the
association
of
their
childhood
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
hear
the
name
,
or
read
the
name
,
of
Yarmouth
,
but
I
be
remind
of
a
certain
Sunday
morning
on
the
beach
,
the
bell
ring
for
church
,
little
em'ly
lean
on
my
shoulder
,
<EOS>
Ham
lazily
drop
stone
into
the
water
,
and
the
sun
,
away
at
sea
,
just
break
through
the
heavy
mist
,
and
show
us
the
ship
,
like
their
own
shadow
.
   
<EOS>
at
last
the
day
come
for
go
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
bear
up
against
the
separation
from
Mr
Peggotty
and
Mrs
Gummidge
,
but
my
agony
of
mind
at
leave
little
Em'ly
be
pierce
.
 
<EOS>
We
go
arm
-
in
-
arm
to
the
public
-
house
where
the
carrier
put
up
,
and
I
promise
,
on
the
road
,
to
write
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
(
I
redeem
that
promise
afterwards
,
in
character
large
than
those
in
which
apartment
be
usually
announce
in
manuscript
,
as
be
to
let
.
)
<EOS>
We
be
greatly
overcome
at
parting
;
and
if
ever
,
in
my
life
,
I
have
have
a
void
make
in
my
heart
,
I
have
one
make
that
day
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
all
the
time
I
have
be
on
my
visit
,
I
have
be
ungrateful
to
my
home
again
,
and
have
think
little
or
nothing
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
no
sooner
turn
towards
it
,
than
my
reproachful
young
conscience
seem
to
point
that
way
with
a
ready
finger
;
and
I
feel
,
all
the
more
for
the
sinking
of
my
spirit
,
that
it
be
my
nest
,
and
that
my
mother
be
my
comforter
and
friend
.
   
<EOS>
this
gain
upon
me
as
we
go
along
;
so
that
the
nearer
we
draw
,
the
more
familiar
the
object
become
that
we
pass
,
<EOS>
the
more
excited
I
be
to
get
there
,
and
to
run
into
her
arm
.
 
<EOS>
but
Peggotty
,
instead
of
share
in
those
transport
,
try
to
check
them
(
though
very
kindly
)
,
and
look
confused
and
out
of
sort
.
   
<EOS>
Blunderstone
Rookery
would
come
,
however
,
in
spite
of
her
,
when
the
carrier
's
horse
pleased
---
and
do
.
 
<EOS>
how
well
I
recollect
it
,
on
a
cold
grey
afternoon
,
with
a
dull
sky
,
threaten
rain
!
   
<EOS>
the
door
open
,
and
I
look
,
half
laughing
and
half
crying
in
my
pleasant
agitation
,
for
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
she
,
but
a
strange
servant
.
   
<EOS>
"
why

Peggotty

"
<EOS>
I

ruefully

"
   
<EOS>
between
her
agitation
,
and
her
natural
awkwardness
in
get
out
of
the
cart
,
Peggotty
be
make
a
most
extraordinary
festoon
of
herself
,
but
I
feel
too
blank
and
strange
to
tell
her
so
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
have
get
down
,
she
take
me
by
the
hand
;
lead
me
,
wonder
,
into
the
kitchen

and
shut
the
door

<EOS>
"

I

why

to

and
what

in
here
for

<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
My
eye
be
full

I
feel
as

go
to
tumble
down

Peggotty
cry
out
<EOS>
no

<EOS>
with
an
astonishing
volume
of
voice
;
and
then
sit
down
,
and
begin
to
pant
,
and
say
I
have
give
her
a
turn

<EOS>
I
give
her
a
hug
to
take
away
the
turn
,
or
to
give
her
another
turn
in
the
right
direction
,
and
then
stand
before
her
,
look
at
her
in
anxious
inquiry

"
You

I
should
have
tell
you
before

say
Peggotty

<EOS>
but
I
have
not
an
opportunity

<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
make
it
,
perhaps
,
but
I
could
not

that
be
always
the
substitute

bring
my

"
go
on

I

more
frightened

"
Master

Peggotty

untie
her
bonnet
with
a

of
way

"

You

<EOS>
I
tremble

turn
white

something

I
do
not

how

connect
with
the
grave
in
the
churchyard
,
and
the
raising
of
the
dead

seem
to
strike
me
like
an
unwholesome
wind

<EOS>
"
a
new

Peggotty

<EOS>
"
a

I
repeat

<EOS>
Peggotty
give
a
gasp

as
if
she

swallow
something

very
hard

,
put
out

say
Peggotty

<EOS>
I
cease
to
draw
back

we
go
straight
to
the
good
parlour

where
she
leave
me

<EOS>
on

My

drop
her

timidly
I

"
   
<EOS>
I
give
him
my
hand

<EOS>
after
a
moment
of
suspense
,
I
go
and
kiss
my
mother
:
she
kiss
me
,
pat
me
gently
on
the
shoulder
,
and
sit
down
again
to
her
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
look
at
her
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
look
at
him
,
I
know
quite
well
that
he
be
look
at
us
both
;
and
I
turn
to
the
window
and
look
out
there
,
at
some
shrub
that
be
droop
their
head
in
the
cold
.
   
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
could
creep
away

I
creep
upstairs

<EOS>
My
old
dear
bedroom
be
change
,
and
I
be
to
lie
a
long
way
off

<EOS>
I
ramble
downstairs
to
find
anything
that
be
like
itself
,
so
alter
it
all
seem
;
and
roam
into
the
yard

<EOS>
I
very
soon
start
back
from
there

for
the
empty
dog

kennel
be
fill
up
with
a
great
dog
---
deep
mouthed
and
black

haired
like
Him

angry
at

out

Chapter
4
.
<EOS>
I
fall
into
disgrace
 
<EOS>
if
the
room
to
which
my
bed
be
remove
be
a
sentient
thing
that
could
give
evidence
,
I
may
appeal
to
it
at
this
day
---
who
sleep
there
now
,
I
wonder
!
<EOS>
---
to
bear
witness
for
me
what
a
heavy
heart
I
carry
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
up
there
,
hear
the
dog
in
the
yard
bark
after
me
all
the
way
while
I
climb
the
stair
;
and
,
look
as
blank
and
strange
upon
the
room
as
the
room
look
upon
me
,
sit
down
with
my
small
hand
cross
,
and
think
.
   
<EOS>
I
think
of
the
odd
thing
.
 
<EOS>
of
the
shape
of
the
room
,
of
the
crack
in
the
ceiling
,
of
the
paper
on
the
wall
,
of
the
flaw
in
the
window
-
glass
making
ripple
and
dimple
on
the
prospect
,
of
the
washing
-
stand
be
rickety
on
its
three
leg
,
and
have
a
discontent
something
about
it
,
which
remind
me
of
Mrs
Gummidge
under
the
influence
of
the
old
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
cry
all
the
time
,
but
,
except
that
I
be
conscious
of
be
cold
and
dejected
,
I
be
sure
I
never
think
why
I
cry
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
in
my
desolation
I
begin
to
consider
that
I
be
dreadfully
in
love
with
little
em'ly
,
and
have
be
tear
away
from
her
to
come
here
where
no
one
seem
to
want
me
,
or
to
care
about
me
,
half
as
much
as
she
do
.
 
<EOS>
this
make
such
a
very
miserable
piece
of
business
of
it
,
that
I
roll
myself
up
in
a
corner
of
the
counterpane
,
and
cry
myself
to
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
awoke
by
somebody
say
"
here
he
be
!
"
and
uncover
my
hot
head
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
and
Peggotty
have
come
to
look
for
me
,
and
it
be
one
of
them
who
have
do
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Davy
,
"
say
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
very
strange
that
she
should
ask
me
,
and
answer
,
"
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
turn
over
on
my
face
,
I
recollect
,
to
hide
my
tremble
lip
,
which
answer
her
with
great
truth
.
<EOS>
"
Davy
,
"
say
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
Davy
,
my
child
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
dare
say
no
word
she
could
have
utter
would
have
affect
me
so
much
,
then
,
as
her
call
me
her
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
hide
my
tear
in
the
bedclothe
,
and
press
her
from
me
with
my
hand
,
when
she
would
have
raise
me
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
this
be
your
doing
,
Peggotty
,
you
cruel

my
mother

<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
at
all
about
it

<EOS>
how
can
you
reconcile
it
to
your
conscience
,
I
wonder
,
to
prejudice
my
own
boy
against
me
,
or
against
anybody
who
be
dear
to
me

<EOS>
what
do
you
mean
by
it

Peggotty

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Poor
Peggotty
lift
up
her
hand
and
eye
,
and
only
answer
,
in
a
sort
of
paraphrase
of
the
grace
I
usually
repeat
after
dinner
,
"
Lord
forgive
you
,
Mrs
Copperfield
,
and
for
what
you
have
say
this
minute
,
may
you
never
be
truly
sorry
!

<EOS>
"
It
be
enough
to
distract
me
,
"
cry
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
in
my
honeymoon
,
too
,
when
my
most
inveterate
enemy
may
relent
,
one
would
think
,
and
not
envy
me
a
little
peace
of
mind
and
happiness

<EOS>
Davy
<EOS>
,
you
naughty
boy
!
 
<EOS>
Peggotty

you
savage
creature

dear
me

cry
my
mother
,
turn
from
one
of
us
to
the
other
,
in
her
pettish
wilful
manner
,
"
what
a
troublesome
world
this
be
,
when
one
have
the
most
right
to
expect
it
to
be
as
agreeable

possible

<EOS>
I
feel
the
touch
of
a
hand
that
I
know
be
neither
her
nor
Peggotty
's
,
and
slip
to
my
foot
at
the
bed

side

<EOS>
It
be
Mr
Murdstone

hand

it
on

<EOS>
He
draw
her
to
him
,
whisper
in
her
ear
,
and
kiss
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
as
well
,
when
I
see
my

's
head
lean
down
upon

I

out

nod

a

She

<EOS>
Peggotty
,
with
some
uneasy
glance
at
me

curtsey
herself
out
of
the
room
without
reply
;
see
,
I
suppose
,
that
she
be
expect
to
go

and
have
no
excuse
for
remain

<EOS>
when
we

leave
alone

he
shut
the

sit
on

hold
me
stand
before
him

look
steadily
into

I

my

no

I
recall
our

thus

I
seem
again

fast

high

<EOS>
"
David

he

,
make
his

thin

by

them
together

I

I
feel
,
in
my
silence

that
my
breath
be
short
now

<EOS>
"
I
make
him
wince
,
and
smart
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
to
myself
,
"
I
will
conquer
that
fellow
"
;
and
if
it
be
to
cost
him
all
the
blood
he
have

I
should
do
it

<EOS>
what
be
that
upon

"
Dirt

I
say
.
   
<EOS>
He
know
it
be
the
mark
of
tear
as
well
as
i.
 
<EOS>
but
if
he
have
ask
the
question
twenty
time
,
each
time
with
twenty
blow
,
I
believe
my
baby
heart
would
have
burst
before
I
would
have
tell
him
so

<EOS>
"
You
have
a
good
deal

<EOS>
He
point
to
the
washing
-
stand
,
which
I
have
make
out
to
be
like
Mrs
Gummidge
,
and
motion
me
with
his
head
to
obey
him
directly
.
<EOS>
I
have
little
doubt
then
,
and
I
have
less
doubt
now
,
that
he
would
have
knock
me
down
without
the
least
compunction
,
if
I
have
hesitate
.
   
<EOS>
"
Clara
,
my
dear

"
he
say
,
when
I
have
do
his
bidding
,
and
he
walk
me
into
the
parlour
,
with
his
hand
still
on
my
arm
;
"
you
will
not
be
make
uncomfortable
any
more

I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
soon
improve
our
youthful
humour

"
   
<EOS>
God
help
me
,
I
may
have
be
improve
for
my
whole
life
,
I
may
have
be
make
another
creature
perhaps
,
for
life
,
by
a
kind
word
at
that
season
.
 
<EOS>
a
word
of
encouragement
and
explanation
,
of
pity
for
my
childish
ignorance
,
of
welcome
home
,
of
reassurance
to
me
that
it
be
home
,
may
have
make
me
dutiful
to
him
in
my
heart
henceforth
,
instead
of
in
my
hypocritical
outside
,
and
may
have
make
me
respect
instead
of
hate
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
my
mother
be
sorry
to
see
me
stand
in
the
room
<EOS>
so
scared
and
strange
,
and
that
,
presently
,
when
I
steal
to
a
chair
,
she
follow
me
with
her
eye
more
sorrowfully
still
---
missing
,
perhaps
,
some
freedom
in
my
childish
tread
---
but
the
word
be
not
speak
,
and
the
time
for
it
be
go
.
   
<EOS>
We
dine
alone
,
<EOS>
we
three
together
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
to
be
very
fond
of
my
mother
<EOS>
---
I
be
afraid
I
like
him
none
the
well
for
that
---
and
she
be
very
fond
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
gather
from
what
they
say
,
that
an
eld
sister
of
his
be
come
to
stay
with
them
,
and
that
she
be
expect
that
evening
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
certain
whether
I
find
out
then
,
or
afterwards
,
that
,
without
be
actively
concern
in
any
business
,
he
have
some
share
in
,
or
some
annual
charge
upon
the
profit
of
,
a
wine
-
merchant
's
house
in
London
,
with
which
his
family
have
be
connect
from
his
great
-
grandfather
's
time
,
and
in
which
his
sister
have
a
similar
interest
;
but
I
may
mention
it
in
this
place
,
whether
or
no
.
   
<EOS>
after
dinner
,
when
we
be
sit
by
the
fire
,
and
I
be
meditate
an
escape
to
Peggotty
without
have
the
hardihood
to
slip
away
,
lest
it
should
offend
the
master
of
the
house
,
a
coach
drive
up
to
the
garden
-
gate
and
he
go
out
to
receive
the
visitor
.
<EOS>
My
mother
follow
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
timidly
follow
her
,
when
she
turn
round
at
the
parlour
door
,
in
the
dusk
,
and
take
me
in
her
embrace
as
she
have
be
use
to
do
<EOS>
,
whisper
me
to
love
my
new
father
and
be
obedient
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
this
hurriedly
and
secretly
,
as
if
it
be
wrong
,
but
tenderly
;
and
,
put
out
her
hand
behind
her
,
hold
mine
in
it
,
until
we
come
near
to
where
he
be
stand
in
the
garden
,
where
she
let
mine
go
,
and
draw
her
through
his
arm
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
Miss
Murdstone
who
be
arrive
,
and
a
gloomy
-
look
lady
she
be
;
dark
,
like
her
brother
,
whom
she
greatly
resemble
in
face
and
voice
;
and
with
very
heavy
eyebrow
,
nearly
meet
over
her
large
nose
,
as
if
,
be
disable
by
the
wrong
of
her
sex
from
wear
whisker
,
she
have
carry
them
to
that
account
.
 
<EOS>
She
bring
with
her
two
uncompromise
hard
black
box
,
with
her
initial
on
the
lid
in
hard
brass
nail
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
pay
the
coachman
she
take
her
money
out
of
a
hard
steel
purse
,
and
she
keep
the
purse
in
a
very
jail
of
a
bag
which
hang
upon
her
arm
by
a
heavy
chain
,
and
shut
up
like
a
bite
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
,
at
that
time
,
see
such
a
metallic
lady
altogether
as
Miss
Murdstone
be
.
   
<EOS>
She
be
bring
into
the
parlour
with
many
token
of
welcome
,
and
there
formally
recognize
my
mother
as
a
new
and
near
relation
.
<EOS>
then
she
look
at
me
,
and
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
be
that
your
boy
,
sister
-
in
-
law
?
"
   
<EOS>
My
mother
acknowledge
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
generally
speak
,
"
say
Miss
Murdstone
,
"
I
do
not
like
boy
.
 
<EOS>
how
d'ye
do
,
boy
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
under
these
encourage
circumstance
,
I
reply
that
I
be
very
well
,
and
that
I
hope
she
be
the
same
;
with
such
an
indifferent
grace
,
that
Miss
Murdstone
dispose
of
me
in
two
word
:
   
"
<EOS>
want
manner
!
"
   
<EOS>
have
utter
which
,
with
great
distinctness
,
she
beg
the
favour
of
be
show
to
her
room
,
which
become
to
me
from
that
time
forth
a
place
of
awe
and
dread
,
wherein
the
two
black
box
be
never
see
open
or
know
to
be
leave
unlocked
,
and
where
(
for
I
peep
in
once
or
twice
when
she
be
out
)
numerous
little
steel
fetter
and
rivet
,
with
which
Miss
Murdstone
embellish
herself
when
she
be
dress
,
generally
hang
upon
the
looking
-
glass
in
formidable
array
.
   
<EOS>
as
well
as
I
could
make
out
,
she
have
come
for
good
,
and
have
no
intention
of
ever
go
again
.
 
<EOS>
She
begin
to
"
help
"
my
mother
next
morning
,
and
be
in
and
out
of
the
store
-
closet
all
day
,
put
thing
to
right
,
and
make
havoc
in
the
old
arrangement
.
 
<EOS>
almost
the
first
remarkable
thing
I
observe
in
Miss
Murdstone
be
,
her
be
constantly
haunt
by
a
suspicion
that
the
servant
have
a
man
secrete
somewhere
on
the
premise
.
 
<EOS>
under
the
influence
of
this
delusion
,
she
dive
into
the
coal
-
cellar
at
the
most
untimely
hour
,
and
scarcely
ever
open
the
door
of
a
dark
cupboard
without
clap
it
to
again
,
in
the
belief
that
she
have
get
him
.
   
<EOS>
though
there
be
nothing
very
airy
about
Miss
Murdstone
,
she
be
a
perfect
Lark
in
point
of
get
up
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
up
(
and
,
as
I
believe
to
this
hour
,
look
for
that
man
)
before
anybody
in
the
house
be
stir
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
give
it
as
her
opinion
that
she
even
sleep
with
one
eye
open
;
but
I
could
not
concur
in
this
idea
;
for
I
try
it
myself
after
hear
the
suggestion
throw
out
,
and
find
it
could
not
be
do
.
   
<EOS>
on
the
very
first
morning
after
her
arrival
she
be
up
and
ring
her
bell
at
cock
-
crow
.
 
<EOS>
when
my
mother
come
down
to
breakfast
and
be
go
to
make
the
tea
,
Miss
Murdstone
give
her
a
kind
of
peck
on
the
cheek
,
which
be
her
near
approach
to
a
kiss
,
and
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
now
,
Clara
,
my
dear
,
I
be
come
here
,
you
know
,
to
relieve
you
of
all
the
trouble
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
much
too
pretty
and
thoughtless
"
---
my
mother
blush
but
laugh
,
and
seem
not
to
dislike
this
character
---
"
to
have
any
duty
impose
upon
you
that
can
be
undertake
by
me
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
give
me
your
key
,
my
dear
,
I
will
attend
to
all
this
sort
of
thing
in
future
.
"
   
<EOS>
from
that
time
,
Miss
Murdstone
keep
the
key
in
her
own
little
jail
all
day
,
and
under
her
pillow
all
night
,
and
my
mother
have
no
more
to
do
with
them
than
I
have
.
   
<EOS>
My
mother
do
not
suffer
her
authority
to
pass
from
her
without
a
shadow
of
protest
.
 
<EOS>
one
night
when
Miss
Murdstone
have
be
develop
certain
household
plan
to
her
brother
,
of
which
he
signify
his
approbation
,
my
mother
suddenly
begin
to
cry
,
and
say
she
think
she
may
have
be
consult
.
   
<EOS>
"
Clara
!
<EOS>
"
say
Mr
Murdstone
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Clara
!
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
at
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
it
be
very
well
to
say
you
wonder
,
Edward
!
"
<EOS>
cry
my
mother
,
"
and
it
be
very
well
for
you
to
talk
about
firmness
,
but
you
would
not
like
it
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
firmness
,
I
may
observe
,
be
the
grand
quality
on
which
both
Mr
and
Miss
Murdstone
take
their
stand
.
 
<EOS>
however
I
may
have
express
my
comprehension
of
it
at
that
time
,
if
I
have
be
call
upon
,
I
nevertheless
do
clearly
comprehend
in
my
own
way
,
that
it
be

name

tyranny

and
for
a
certain
gloomy
,
arrogant
,
devil
's
humour
,
that
be
in
them
both
.
 
<EOS>
the
creed
,
as
I
should
state
it
now
,
be
this
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Murdstone
be
firm
;
nobody
in
his
world
be
to
be
so
firm
as
Mr
Murdstone
;
nobody
else
in
his
world
be
to
be
firm
at
all
,
for
everybody
be
to
be
bent
to
his
firmness
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
be
an
exception
.
 
<EOS>
She
may
be
firm
,
but
only
by
relationship
,
and
in
an
inferior
and
tributary
degree
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
be
another
exception
.
 
<EOS>
She
may
be
firm
,
and
must
be
;
but
only
in
bear
their
firmness
,
and
firmly
believe
there
be
no
other
firmness
upon
earth
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
hard

say
my

Edward

it
be
very
hard
that

may
not

<EOS>
I
be

I

very
well

magnanimous

,
"
be

to
bed
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
find
the
door
,
through
the
tear
that
stand
in
my
eye
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
sorry
for
my
mother
's
distress
;
but
I
grope
my
way
out
,
and
grope
my
way
up
to
my
room
in
the
dark
,
without
even
have
the
heart
to
say
good
night
to
Peggotty
,
or
to
get
a
candle
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
when
her
come
up
to
look
for
me
,
an
hour
or
so
afterwards
,
awoke
me
,
she
say
that
my
mother
have
go
to
bed
poorly
,
and
that
Mr
and
Miss
Murdstone
be
sit
alone
.
   
<EOS>
go
down
next
morning
rather
earlier
than
usual
,
I
pause
outside
the
parlour
door
,
on
hear
my
mother
's
voice
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
very
earnestly
and
humbly
entreat
Miss
Murdstone
's
pardon
,
which
that
lady
grant
,
and
a
perfect
reconciliation
take
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
know
my
mother
afterwards
to
give
an
opinion
on
any
matter
,
without
first
appeal
to
Miss
Murdstone
,
or
without
have
first
ascertain
by
some
sure
mean
,
what
Miss
Murdstone
's
opinion
be
;
and
I
never
see
Miss
Murdstone
<EOS>
,
when
out
of
temper
(
she
be
infirm
that
way
)
,
move
her
hand
towards
her
bag
as
if
she
be
go
to
take
out
the
key
and
offer
to
resign
them
to
my
mother
,
without
see
that
my
mother
be
in
a
terrible
fright
.
   
<EOS>
the
gloomy
taint
that
be
in
the
Murdstone
blood
,
darken
the
Murdstone
religion
,
which
be
austere
and
wrathful
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
think
,
since
,
that
its
assuming
that
character
be
a
necessary
consequence
of
Mr
Murdstone
's
firmness
,
which
would
not
allow
him
to
let
anybody
off
from
the
utmost
weight
of
the
severe
penalty
he
could
find
any
excuse
for
.
 
<EOS>
be
this
as
it
may
<EOS>
,
I
well
remember
the
tremendous
visage
with
which
we
use
to
go
to
church
,
and
the
change
air
of
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
again
,
the
dread
Sunday
come
round
,
and
I
file
into
the
old
pew
first
,
like
a
guard
captive
bring
to
a
condemned
service
.
 
<EOS>
again
,
Miss
Murdstone
,
in
a
black
velvet
gown
,
that
look
as
if
it
have
be
make
out
of
a
pall
,
follow
close
upon
me
;
then
my
mother
;
then
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
Peggotty
now
,
as
in
the
old
time
.
 
<EOS>
again
,
I
listen
to
Miss
Murdstone
mumble
the
response
,
and
emphasize
all
the
dread
word
with
a
cruel
relish
.
 
<EOS>
again
,
I
see
her
dark
eye
roll
round
the
church
when
she
say
"
miserable
sinner
"
,
as
if
she
be
call
all
the
congregation
name
.
 
<EOS>
again
,
I
catch
rare
glimpse
of
my
mother
,
move
her
lip
timidly
between
the
two
,
with
one
of
them
mutter
at
each
ear
like
low
thunder
.
 
<EOS>
again
,
I
wonder
with
a
sudden
fear
whether
it
be
likely
that
our
good
old
clergyman
can
be
wrong
,
and
Mr
and
Miss
Murdstone
right
,
and
that
all
the
angel
in
Heaven
can
be
destroy
angel
.
 
<EOS>
again
,
if
I
move
a
finger
or
relax
a
muscle
of
my
face
,
Miss
Murdstone
poke
me
with
her
prayer
-
book
,
and
make
my
side
ache
.
   
<EOS>
yes
,
and
again
,
as
we
walk
home
,
I
note
some
neighbour
look
at
my
mother
and
at
me
,
and
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
again
,
as
the
three
go
on
arm
-
in
-
arm
,
and
I
linger
behind
alone
<EOS>
,
I
follow
some
of
those
look
,
and
wonder
if
my
mother
's
step
be
really
not
so
light
as
I
have
see
it
,
and
if
the
gaiety
of
her
beauty
be
really
almost
worry
away
.
 
<EOS>
again
,
I
wonder
whether
any
of
the
neighbour
call
to
mind
,
as
I
do
,
how
we
use
to
walk
home
together
,
she
and
I
;
and
I
wonder
stupidly
about
that
,
all
the
dreary
dismal
day
.
   
<EOS>
there
have
be
some
talk
on
occasion
of
my
go
to
boarding
-
school
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
and
Miss
Murdstone
have
originate
it
,
and
my
mother
have
of
course
agree
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
,
however
,
be
conclude
on
the
subject
yet
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
I
learn
lesson
at
home
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
ever
forget
those
lesson
!
 
<EOS>
They
be
preside
over
nominally
by
my
mother
,
but
really
by
Mr
Murdstone
and
his
sister
,
who
be
always
present
,
and
find
them
a
favourable
occasion
for
give
my
mother
lesson
in
that
miscall
firmness
,
which
be
the
bane
of
both
our
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
be
keep
at
home
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
apt
enough
to
learn
,
and
willing
enough
,
when
my
mother
and
I
have
live
alone
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
faintly
remember
learn
the
alphabet
at
her
knee
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
day
,
when
I
look
upon
the
fat
black
letter
in
the
primer
,
the
puzzling
novelty
of
their
shape
,
and
the
easy
good
-
nature
of
O^
and
Q^
and
S^
,
seem
to
present
themselves
again
before
me
as
they
use
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
recall
no
feeling
of
disgust
or
reluctance
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
I
seem
to
have
walk
along
a
path
of
flower
as
far
as
the
crocodile
-
book
,
and
to
have
be
cheer
by
the
gentleness
of
my
mother
's
voice
and
manner
all
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
but
these
solemn
lesson
which
succeed
those
<EOS>
,
I
remember
as
the
death
-
blow
of
my
peace
,
and
a
grievous
daily
drudgery
and
misery
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
very
long
,
very
numerous
,
very
hard
---
perfectly
unintelligible
,
some
of
them
,
to
me
---
and
I
be
generally
as
much
bewilder
by
them
as
I
believe
my
poor
mother
be
herself
.
   
<EOS>
let
me
remember
how
it
use
to
be
,
and
bring
one
morning
back
again
.
   
<EOS>
I
come
into
the
second
-
good
parlour
after
breakfast
,
with
my
book
,
and
an
exercise
-
book
,
and
a
slate
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
be
ready
for
me
at
her
writing
-
desk
,
but
not
half
so
ready
as
Mr
Murdstone
in
his
easy
-
chair
by
the
window
(
though
he
pretend
to
be
read
a
book
)
,
or
as
Miss
Murdstone
,
sit
near
my
mother
string
steel
bead
.
<EOS>
the
very
sight
of
these
two
have
such
an
influence
over
me
,
that
I
begin
to
feel
the
word
I
have
be
at
infinite
pain
to
get
into
my
head
,
all
slide
away
,
and
go
I
do
not
know
where
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
where
they
do
go
,
by
the
by
?
   
<EOS>
I
hand
the
first
book
to
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
a
grammar
,
perhaps
a
history
,
or
geography
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
<EOS>
a
last
drowning
look
at
the
page
as
I
give
it
into
her
hand
,
and
start
off
aloud
at
a
racing
pace
while
I
have
get
it
fresh
.
 
<EOS>
I
trip
over
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Murdstone
look
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
trip
over
another
word
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
look
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
redden
,
tumble
over
half
-
a
-
dozen
word
,
and
stop
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
my
mother
would
show
me
the
book
if
she
dare
,
but
she
do
not
dare
,
and
<EOS>
she
say
softly
:
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Davy
,
Davy
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
Clara
,
"
say
Mr
Murdstone
,
"
be
firm
with
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
say
,
"
oh
,
Davy
,
Davy
!
"
 
<EOS>
that
be
childish
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
his
lesson
,
or
he
do
not
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
do
not
know
it
,
"
Miss
Murdstone
interpose
awfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
really
afraid
he
do
not
,
"
say
my
mother
.
   
<EOS>
"
then
,
you
see
,
Clara
,
"
return
Miss
Murdstone
,
"
you
should
just
give
him
the
book
back
,
and
make
him
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
certainly
,
"
say
my
mother
;
"
that
be
what
I
intend
to
do
,
my
dear
Jane
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
Davy
,
try
once
more
,
and
do
not
be
stupid
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
obey
the
first
clause
of
the
injunction
by
try
once
more
,
but
be
not
so
successful
with
the
second
,
for
I
be
very
stupid
.
 
<EOS>
I
tumble
down
before
I
get
to
the
old
place
,
at
a
point
where
I
be
all
right
before
,
and
stop
to
think
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
think
about
the
lesson
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
of
the
number
of
yard
of
net
in
Miss
Murdstone
's
cap
,
or
of
the
price
of
Mr
Murdstone
's
dressing
-
gown
,
or
any
such
ridiculous
problem
that
I
have
no
business
with
,
and
do
not
want
to
have
anything
at
all
to
do
with
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Murdstone
make
a
movement
of
impatience
which
I
have
be
expect
for
a
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
do
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
glance
submissively
at
them
,
shut
the
book
,
and
lay
it
by
as
an
arrear
to
be
work
out
when
my
other
task
be
do
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
pile
of
these
arrear
very
soon
,
and
it
swell
like
a
roll
snowball
.
 
<EOS>
the
big
it
get
,
the
more
stupid
I
get
.
 
<EOS>
the
case
be
so
hopeless
,
and
I
feel
that
I
be
wallow
in
such
a
bog
of
nonsense
,
that
I
give
up
all
idea
of
get
out
,
and
abandon
myself
to
my
fate
.
 
<EOS>
the
despairing
way
in
which
my
mother
and
I
look
at
each
other
,
as
I
blunder
on
,
be
truly
melancholy
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
great
effect
in
these
miserable
lesson
be
when
my
mother
(
think
nobody
be
observe
her
)
try
to
give
me
the
cue
by
the
motion
of
her
lip
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
instant
,
Miss
Murdstone
,
who
have
be
lie
in
wait
for
nothing
else
all
along
,
say
in
a
deep
warning
voice
:
   
"
Clara
!
"
   
<EOS>
My
mother
start
,
colour
,
and
smile
faintly
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Murdstone
come
out
of
his
chair
,
take
the
book
,
throw
it
at
me
or
box
my
ear
with
it
,
and
turn
me
out
of
the
room
by
the
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
even
when
the
lesson
be
do
,
the
bad
be
yet
to
happen
,
in
the
shape
of
an
appalling
sum
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
invent
for
me
,
and
deliver
to
me
orally
by
Mr
Murdstone
,
and
begin
,
"
if
I
go
into
a
cheesemonger
's
shop
,
and
buy
five
thousand
double
-
Gloucester
cheese
at
fourpence
-
halfpenny
each
,
present
payment
"
---
at
which
I
see
Miss
Murdstone
secretly
overjoy
.
 
<EOS>
I
pore
over
these
cheese
without
any
result
or
enlightenment
until
dinner
-
time
,
when
,
have
make
a
Mulatto
of
myself
by
get
the
dirt
of
the
slate
into
the
pore
of
my
skin
,
I
have
a
slice
of
bread
to
help
me
out
with
the
cheese
,
and
be
consider
in
disgrace
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
.
   
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
,
at
this
distance
of
time
,
as
if
my
unfortunate
study
generally
take
this
course
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
do
very
well
if
I
have
be
without
the
Murdstones
;
but
the
influence
of
the
Murdstones
upon
me
be
like
the
fascination
of
two
snake
on
a
wretched
young
bird
.
 
<EOS>
even
when
I
do
get
through
the
morning
with
tolerable
credit
,
there
be
not
much
gain
but
dinner
;
for
Miss
Murdstone
never
could
endure
to
see
me
untasked
,
and
if
I
rashly
make
any
show
of
be
unemployed
,
call
her
brother
's
attention
to
me
by
say
,
"
Clara
,
my
dear
,
there
be
nothing
like
work
---
give
your
boy
an
exercise
"
;
which
cause
me
to
be
clap
down
to
some
new
labour
,
there
and
then
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
any
recreation
with
other
child
of
my
age
,
I
have
very
little
of
that
;
for
the
gloomy
theology
of
the
Murdstones
make
all
child
out
to
be
a
swarm
of
little
viper
(
though
there
be
a
child
once
set
in
the
midst
of
the
Disciples
)
,
and
hold
that
they
contaminate
one
another
.
   
<EOS>
the
natural
result
of
this
treatment
,
continue
,
I
suppose
,
for
some
six
month
or
more
,
be
to
make
me
sullen
,
dull
,
and
dog
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
make
the
less
so
by
my
sense
of
be
daily
more
and
more
shut
out
and
alienate
from
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
should
have
be
almost
stupefy
but
for
one
circumstance
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
this
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
have
leave
a
small
collection
of
book
in
a
little
room
upstairs
,
to
which
I
have
access
(
for
it
adjoin
my
own
)
and
which
nobody
else
in
our
house
ever
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
from
that
bless
little
room
,
Roderick
Random
,
Peregrine
Pickle
,
Humphrey
Clinker
,
Tom
Jones
,
the
Vicar
of
Wakefield
,
Don
Quixote
,
Gil
Blas
,
and
Robinson
Crusoe
,
come
out
,
a
glorious
host
,
to
keep
me
company
.
<EOS>
They
keep
alive
my
fancy
,
and
my
hope
of
something
beyond
that
place
and
time
,
---
they
,
and
the
Arabian
Nights
,
and
the
Tales
of
the
Genii
,
---
and
do
me
no
harm
;
for
whatever
harm
be
in
some
of
them
be
not
there
for
me
;
I
know
nothing
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
astonishing
to
me
now
,
how
I
find
time
,
in
the
midst
of
my
poring
and
blundering
over
heavy
theme
,
to
read
those
book
as
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
curious
to
me
how
I
could
ever
have
console
myself
under
my
small
trouble
(
which
be
great
trouble
to
me
)
,
by
impersonate
my
favourite
character
in
them
---
as
I
do
---
and
by
put
Mr
and
Miss
Murdstone
into
all
the
bad
one
---
which
I
do
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
Tom
Jones
(
a
child
's
Tom
Jones
,
a
harmless
creature
)
for
a
week
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
sustain
my
own
idea
of
Roderick
Random
for
a
month
at
a
stretch
,
I
verily
believe
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
greedy
relish
for
a
few
volume
of
voyage
and
Travels
<EOS>
---
I
forget
<EOS>
what
,
now
---
that
be
on
those
shelf
;
and
for
day
and
day
I
can
remember
to
have
go
about
my
region
of
our
house
,
arm
with
the
centre
-
piece
out
of
an
old
set
of
boot
-
tree
---
the
perfect
realization
of
Captain
Somebody
,
of
the
Royal
British
Navy
,
in
danger
of
be
beset
by
savage
,
and
resolve
to
sell
his
life
at
a
great
price
.
 
<EOS>
the
Captain
never
lose
dignity
,
from
have
his
ear
box
with
the
Latin
Grammar
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
;
but
the
Captain
be
a
captain
and
a
hero
,
in
despite
of
all
the
grammar
of
all
the
language
in
the
world
,
dead
or
alive
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
my
only
and
my
constant
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
think
of
it
,
the
picture
always
rise
in
my
mind
,
of
a
summer
evening
,
the
boy
at
play
in
the
churchyard
,
and
I
sit
on
my
bed
,
read
as
if
for
life
.
 
<EOS>
every
barn
in
the
neighbourhood
,
every
stone
in
the
church
,
and
every
foot
of
the
churchyard
,
have
some
association
of
its
own
,
in
my
mind
,
connect
with
these
book
,
and
stand
for
some
locality
make
famous
in
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
Tom
Pipes
go
climb
up
the
church
-
steeple
;
I
have
watch
Strap
,
with
the
knapsack
on
his
back
,
stop
to
rest
himself
upon
the
wicket
-
gate
;
and
I
know
that
Commodore
Trunnion
hold
that
club
with
Mr
Pickle
,
in
the
parlour
of
our
little
village
alehouse
.
   
<EOS>
the
reader
now
understand
,
as
well
as
I
do
,
what
I
be
when
I
come
to
that
point
of
my
youthful
history
to
which
I
be
now
come
again
.
   
<EOS>
one
morning
when
I
go
into
the
parlour
with
my
book
,
I
find
my
mother
look
anxious
,
Miss
Murdstone
look
firm
,
and
Mr
Murdstone
bind
something
round
the
bottom
of
a
cane
---
a
lithe
and
limber
cane
,
which
he
leave
off
bind
when
I
come
in
,
and
poise
and
switch
in
the
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
Clara
,
"
say
Mr
Murdstone
,
"
I
have
be
often
flog
myself
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
to
be
sure
;
of
course
,
"
say
Miss
Murdstone
.
   
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
my
dear
Jane
,
"
falter
my
mother
,
meekly
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
---
but
do
you
think
it
do
Edward
good
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
it
do
Edward
harm
,
Clara
?
"
ask
Mr
Murdstone
,
gravely
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
point
,
"
say
his
sister
.
   
<EOS>
to
this
my
mother
return
,
"
certainly
,
my
dear
Jane
,
"
and
say
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
I
feel
apprehensive
that
I
be
personally
interested
in
this
dialogue
,
and
seek
Mr
Murdstone
's
eye
as
it
light
on
mine
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
David
,
"
he
say
---
<EOS>
and
I
see
that
cast
again
as
he
say
it
<EOS>
---
"
you
must
be
far
more
careful
today
than
usual
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
give
the
cane
another
poise
,
and
another
switch
;
and
have
finish
his
preparation
of
it
,
lay
it
down
beside
him
,
with
an
impressive
look
,
and
take
up
his
book
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
a
good
freshener
to
my
presence
of
mind
,
as
a
beginning
.
<EOS>
I
feel
the
word
of
my
lesson
slip
off
,
not
one
by
one
,
or
line
by
line
,
but
by
the
entire
page
;
I
try
to
lay
hold
of
them
;
but
they
seem
,
if
I
may
so
express
it
,
to
have
put
skate
on
,
and
to
skim
away
from
me
with
a
smoothness
there
be
no
checking
.
   
<EOS>
We
begin
badly
,
and
go
on
bad
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
come
in
with
an
idea
of
distinguish
myself
rather
,
conceive
that
I
be
very
well
prepared
;
but
it
turn
out
to
be
quite
a
mistake
.
 
<EOS>
Book
after
book
be
add
to
the
heap
of
failure
,
Miss
Murdstone
be
firmly
watchful
of
us
all
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
we
come
at
last
to
the
five
thousand
cheese
(
cane
he
make
it
that
day
,
I
remember
)
,
my
mother
burst
out
cry
.
   
<EOS>
"
Clara
!
<EOS>
"
say
Miss
Murdstone
,
in
her
warning
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
quite
well
,
my
dear
Jane
,
I
think
,
"
say
my
mother
.
   
<EOS>
I
see
him
wink
,
solemnly
,
at
his
sister
,
as
he
rise
and
say
,
take
up
the
cane
:
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
Jane
,
we
can
hardly
expect
Clara
to
bear
,
with
perfect
firmness
,
the
worry
and
torment
that
David
have
occasion
her
today
.
 
<EOS>
that
would
be
stoical
.
 
<EOS>
Clara
be
greatly
strengthen
and
improve
,
but
we
can
hardly
expect
so
much
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
David
,
you
and
I
will
go
upstairs
,
boy
.
"
   
<EOS>
as
he
take
me
out
at
the
door
,
my
mother
run
towards
us
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
say
,
"
Clara
!
<EOS>
be
you
a
perfect
fool
?
"
and
interfere
.
<EOS>
I
see
my
mother
stop
her
ear
then
,
and
I
hear
her
crying
.
   
<EOS>
He
walk
me
up
to
my
room
slowly
and
gravely
<EOS>
---
I
be
certain
he
have
a
delight
in
that
formal
parade
of
execute
justice
---
and
when
we
get
there
,
suddenly
twist
my
head
under
his
arm
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Murdstone
!
 
<EOS>
Sir
!
<EOS>
"
I
cry
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
do
not
beat
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
try
to
learn
,
sir
,
but
I
can
not
learn
while
you
and
Miss
Murdstone
be
by
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
can
not
you
,
indeed
,
David
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
will
try
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
have
my
head
as
in
a
vice
,
but
I
twine
round
him
somehow
,
and
stop
him
for
a
moment
,
entreat
him
not
to
beat
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
a
moment
that
I
stop
him
,
for
he
cut
me
heavily
an
instant
afterwards
,
and
in
the
same
instant
I
catch
the
hand
with
which
he
hold
me
in
my
mouth
,
between
my
tooth
,
and
bite
it
through
.
 
<EOS>
It
set
my
tooth
on
edge
to
think
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
He
beat
me
then
,
as
if
he
would
have
beat
me
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
above
all
the
noise
we
make
,
I
hear
them
run
up
the
stair
,
and
cry
out
<EOS>
---
I
hear
my
mother
cry
out
---
and
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
be
go
;
and
the
door
be
lock
outside
;
and
I
be
lie
,
fevered
and
hot
,
and
tear
,
and
sore
,
and
rage
in
my
puny
way
,
upon
the
floor
.
   
<EOS>
how
well
I
recollect
,
when
I
become
quiet
,
what
an
unnatural
stillness
seem
to
reign
through
the
whole
house
!
 
<EOS>
how
well
I
remember
,
when
my
smart
and
passion
begin
to
cool
,
how
wicked
I
begin
to
feel
!
   
<EOS>
I
sit
listen
for
a
long
while
,
but
there
be
not
a
sound
.
 
<EOS>
I
crawl
up
from
the
floor
,
and
see
my
face
in
the
glass
,
so
swollen
,
red
,
and
ugly
that
it
almost
frighten
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
stripe
be
sore
and
stiff
,
and
make
me
cry
afresh
,
when
I
move
;
but
they
be
nothing
to
the
guilt
I
feel
.
 
<EOS>
It
lie
heavier
on
my
breast
<EOS>
than
if
I
have
be
a
most
atrocious
criminal
,
I
dare
say
.
   
<EOS>
It
have
begin
to
grow
dark
,
and
I
have
shut
the
window
(
I
have
be
lie
,
for
the
most
part
,
with
my
head
upon
the
sill
,
by
turn
cry
,
dozing
,
and
look
listlessly
out
)
,
when
the
key
be
turn
,
and
Miss
Murdstone
come
in
with
some
bread
and
meat
,
and
milk
.
 
<EOS>
these
she
put
down
upon
the
table
without
a
word
,
glare
at
me
the
while
with
exemplary
firmness
,
and
then
retire
,
lock
the
door
after
her
.
   
<EOS>
long
after
it
be
dark
<EOS>
I
sit
there
,
wonder
whether
anybody
else
would
come
.
 
<EOS>
when
this
appear
improbable
for
that
night
,
I
undress
,
and
go
to
bed
;
and
,
there
,
I
begin
to
wonder
fearfully
what
would
be
do
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
whether
it
be
a
criminal
act
that
I
have
commit
?
 
<EOS>
whether
I
should
be
take
into
custody
,
and
send
to
prison
?
 
<EOS>
whether
I
be
at
all
in
danger
of
be
hang
?
   
<EOS>
I
never
shall
forget
the
waking
,
next
morning
;
the
be
cheerful
and
fresh
for
the
first
moment
,
and
then
the
being
weigh
down
by
the
stale
and
dismal
oppression
of
remembrance
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
reappear
before
I
be
out
of
bed
;
tell
me
,
in
so
many
word
,
that
I
be
free
to
walk
in
the
garden
for
half
an
hour
and
no
longer
;
and
retire
,
leave
the
door
open
,
that
I
may
avail
myself
of
that
permission
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
so
,
and
do
so
every
morning
of
my
imprisonment
,
which
last
five
day
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
could
have
see
my
mother
alone
,
I
should
have
go
down
on
my
knee
to
her
and
besought
her
forgiveness
;
but
I
see
no
one
,
Miss
Murdstone
except
,
during
the
whole
time
---
except
at
evening
prayer
in
the
parlour
;
to
which
I
be
escort
by
Miss
Murdstone
after
everybody
else
be
place
;
where
I
be
station
,
a
young
outlaw
,
all
alone
by
myself
near
the
door
;
and
whence
<EOS>
I
be
solemnly
conduct
by
my
jailer
,
before
any
one
arise
from
the
devotional
posture
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
observe
that
my
mother
be
as
far
off
from
me
as
she
could
be
,
and
keep
her
face
another
way
so
that
I
never
see
it
;
and
that
Mr
Murdstone
's
hand
be
bind
up
in
a
large
linen
wrapper
.
   
<EOS>
the
length
of
those
five
day
I
can
convey
no
idea
of
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
They
occupy
the
place
of
year
in
my
remembrance
.
 
<EOS>
the
way
in
which
I
listen
to
all
the
incident
of
the
house
that
make
themselves
audible
to
me
;
the
ringing
of
bell
,
the
opening
and
shutting
of
door
,
the
murmuring
of
voice
,
the
footstep
on
the
stair
;
to
any
laughing
,
whistle
,
or
singe
,
outside
,
which
seem
more
dismal
than
anything
else
to
me
in
my
solitude
and
disgrace
---
the
uncertain
pace
of
the
hour
,
especially
at
night
,
when
I
would
wake
think
it
be
morning
,
and
find
that
the
family
be
not
yet
go
to
bed
,
and
that
all
the
length
of
night
have
yet
to
come
---
the
depressed
dream
and
nightmare
I
have
---
the
return
of
day
,
noon
,
afternoon
,
evening
,
when
the
boy
play
in
the
churchyard
,
and
I
watch
them
from
a
distance
within
the
room
,
be
ashamed
to
show
myself
at
the
window
lest
they
should
know
I
be
a
prisoner
---
the
strange
sensation
of
never
hear
myself
speak
---
the
fleeting
interval
of
something
like
cheerfulness
,
which
come
with
eating
and
drink
,
and
go
away
with
it
---
the
setting
in
of
rain
one
evening
,
with
a
fresh
smell
,
and
its
come
down
faster
and
faster
between
me
and
the
church
,
until
it
and
gather
night
seem
to
quench
me
in
gloom
,
and
fear
,
and
remorse
---
all
this
appear
to
have
go
round
and
round
for
year
instead
of
day
<EOS>
,
it
be
so
vividly
and
strongly
stamp
on
my
remembrance
.
<EOS>
on
the
last
night
of
my
restraint
,
I
be
awaken
by
hear
my
own
name
speak
in
a
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
I
start
up
in
bed
,
and
put
out
my
arm
in
the
dark
,
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
be
that
you
,
Peggotty
?
"
   
<EOS>
there
be
no
immediate
answer
,
but
presently
I
hear
my
name
again
,
in
a
tone
so
very
mysterious
and
awful
,
that
I
think
I
should
have
go
into
a
fit
,
if
it
have
not
occur
to
me
that
it
must
have
come
through
the
keyhole
.
   
<EOS>
I
grope
my
way
to
the
door
,
and
put
my
own
lip
to
the
keyhole
,
whisper
:
"
<EOS>
be
that
you
,
Peggotty
dear
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
my
own
precious
Davy
,
"
she
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
as
soft
as
a
mouse
,
or
the
Cat'll
hear
us
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
understand
this
to
mean
Miss
Murdstone
,
and
be
sensible
of
the
urgency
of
the
case
;
her
room
be
close
by
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
how
be
mama
,
dear
Peggotty
?
 
<EOS>
be
she
very
angry
with
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
hear
Peggotty
cry
softly
on
her
side
of
the
keyhole
,
as
I
be
do
on
mine
,
before
she
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
no

not
very

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
what
be

"
school

<EOS>
near
London
,
"
be
Peggotty
's
answer
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
get
her
to
repeat
it
,
for
she
speak
it
the
first
time
quite
down
my
throat
,
in
consequence
of
my
have
forget
to
take
my
mouth
away
from
the
keyhole
and
put
my
ear
there
;
and
though
her
word
tickle
me
a
good
deal
,
I
do
not
hear
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
when
,
Peggotty
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
be
that
the
reason
why
Miss
Murdstone
take
the
clothe
out
of
my
drawer
?
"
<EOS>
which
she
have
do
,
though
I
have
forget
to
mention
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
yes

say
Peggotty

<EOS>

Peggotty

<EOS>
"
Morning

"
   
<EOS>
then
Peggotty
fit
her
mouth
close
to
the
keyhole
,
and
deliver
these
word
through
it
with
as
much
feeling
and
earnestness
as
a
keyhole
have
ever
be
the
medium
of
communicating
,
I
will
venture
to
assert
:
shooting
in
each
break
little
sentence
in
a
convulsive
little
burst
of
its
own
.
   
<EOS>
"
Davy
,
dear

<EOS>
if
I

azackly
as
intimate

<EOS>
lately

I
use

It

<EOS>
just
as
well

more

my
pretty
poppet

what

<EOS>
I

"
Peggotty
fall
to
kiss
the

,
as
she
could
not

me

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
Will
you

you

"
   
<EOS>
the
kind
soul
promise
,
and
we
both
of
us
kiss
the
keyhole
with
the
great
affection
<EOS>
---
I
pat
it
with
my
hand
,
I
recollect
,
as
if
it
have
be
her
honest
face
---
and
part
.
 
<EOS>
from
that
night
there
grow
up
in
my
breast
a
feeling
for
Peggotty
which
I
can
not
very
well
define
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
replace
my
mother
;
no
one
could
do
that
;
but
she
come
into
a
vacancy
in
my
heart
,
which
close
upon
her
,
and
I
feel
towards
her
something
I
have
never
feel
for
any
other
human
being
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
sort
of
comical
affection
,
too
;
and
yet
if
she
have
die
,
I
can
not
think
what
I
should
have
do
,
or
how
I
should
have
act
out
the
tragedy
it
would
have
be
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
morning
Miss
Murdstone
appear
as
usual
,
and
tell
me
I
be
go
to
school
;
which
be
not
altogether
such
news
to
me
as
she
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
She
also
inform
me
that
when
I
be
dress
,
I
be
to
come
downstairs
into
the
parlour
,
and
have
my
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
I
find
my
mother
,
very
pale
and
with
red
eye
:
into
whose
arm
I
run
,
and
beg
her
pardon
from
my
suffering
soul
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Davy
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
you
could
hurt
anyone
I
love
!
 
<EOS>
try
to
be
well
,
pray
to
be
well
!
 
<EOS>
I
forgive
you
;
but
I
be
so
grieved
,
Davy
,
that
you
should
have
such
bad
passion
in
your
heart
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
have
persuade
her
that
I
be
a
wicked
fellow
,
and
she
be
more
sorry
for
that
than
for
my
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
it
sorely
.
 
<EOS>
I
try
to
eat
my
parting
breakfast
,
but
my
tear
drop
upon
my
bread
-
and
-
butter
,
and
trickle
into
my
tea
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
my
mother
look
at
me
sometimes
,
and
then
glance
at
the
watchful
Miss
Murdstone
,
and
than
look
down
,
or
look
away
.

I

Miss

enough
to
take

out

and
to
say
on
the
way
that
she
hope
I
would
repent
,
before
I
come
to
a
bad
end

Chapter

<EOS>
I
be
send
away
from
home
 
<EOS>
We
may
have
go
about
half
a
mile
,
and
my
pocket
-
handkerchief
be
quite
wet
through
,
when
the
carrier
stop
short
.
 
<EOS>
look
out
to
ascertain
for
what
,
I
see
,
to
my
amazement
,
Peggotty
burst
from
a
hedge
and
climb
into
the
cart
.
 
<EOS>
She
take
me
in
both
her
arm
,
and
squeeze
me
to
her
stay
until
the
pressure
on
my
nose
be
extremely
painful
,
though
I
never
think
of
that
till
afterwards
when
I
find
it
very
tender
.
 
<EOS>
not
a
single
word
do
Peggotty
speak
.
<EOS>
release
one
of
her
arm
,
she
put
it
down
in
her
pocket
to
the
elbow
,
and
bring
out
some
paper
bag
of
cake
which
she
cram
into
my
pocket
,
and
a
purse
which
she
put
into
my
hand
,
but
not
one
word
<EOS>
do
she
say
.
 
<EOS>
after
another
and
a
final
squeeze
with
both
arm
,
she
get
down
from
the
cart
and
run
away
;
and
,
my
belief
be
,
and
have
always
be
,
without
a
solitary
button
on
her
gown
.
 
<EOS>
I
pick
up
one
,
of
several
that
be
roll
about
,
and
treasure
it
as
a
keepsake
for
a
long
time
.
   
<EOS>
the
carrier
look
at
me
,
as
if
to
inquire
if
she
be
come
back
.
<EOS>
I
shake
my
head
,
and
say
I
think
not
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
come
up
,
"
say
the
carrier
to
the
lazy
horse
;
who
come
up
accordingly
.
   
<EOS>
have
by
this
time
cry
as
much
as
I
possibly
could
,
I
begin
to
think
it
be
of
no
use
cry
any
more
,
especially
as
neither
Roderick
Random
,
nor
that
Captain
in
the
Royal
British
Navy
,
have
ever
cry
,
that
I
could
remember
,
in
try
situation
.
 
<EOS>
the
carrier
,
see
me
in
this
resolution
,
propose
that
my
pocket
-
handkerchief
should
be
spread
upon
the
horse
's
back
to
dry
.
 
<EOS>
I
thank
him
,
and
assent
;
and
particularly
small
it
look
,
under
those
circumstance
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
now
leisure
to
examine
the
purse
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
stiff
leather
purse
,
with
a
snap
,
and
have
three
bright
shilling
in
it
,
which
Peggotty
have
evidently
polish
up
with
whitening
,
for
my
great
delight
.
 
<EOS>
but
its
most
precious
content
be
two
half
-
crown
fold
together
in
a
bit
of
paper
,
on
which
be
write
,
in
my
mother
's
hand
,
"
for
Davy
.
 
<EOS>
with
my
love
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
overcome
by
this
,
that
I
ask
the
carrier
to
be
so
good
as
to
reach
me
<EOS>
my
pocket
-
handkerchief
again
;
but
he
say
he
think
I
have
better
do
without
it
,
and
I
think
I
really
have
,
so
I
wipe
my
eye
on
my
sleeve
and
stop
myself
.
   
<EOS>
for
good
,
too
;
though
,
in
consequence
of
my
previous
emotion
,
I
be
still
occasionally
seize
with
a
stormy
sob
.
 
<EOS>
after
we
have
jog
on
for
some
little
time
,
I
ask
the
carrier
if
he
be
go
all
the
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
all
the
way
where
?
"
inquire
the
carrier
.
   
<EOS>
"
there
,
"
I
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
where
be
there
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
the
carrier
.
   
<EOS>
"
Near
London
,
"
I
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
that
horse
,
"
say
the
carrier
,
jerk
the
rein
to
point
him
out
,
"
would
be
deader
than
pork
afore
<EOS>
he
get
over
half
the
ground
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
be
you
only
go
to
Yarmouth
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
about
it
,
"
say
the
carrier
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
there
I
shall
take
you
to
the
stage
-
cutch
,
and
the
stage
-
cutch
that
will
take
you
to
---
wherever
it
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
as
this
be
a
great
deal
for
the
carrier
(
whose
name
be
Mr
Barkis
)
to
say
---
he
be
,
as
I
observe
in
a
former
chapter
,
of
a
phlegmatic
temperament
,
and
not
at
all
conversational
---
I
offer
him
a
cake
as
a
mark
of
attention
,
which
he
eat
at
one
gulp
,
exactly
like
an
elephant
,
and
which
make
no
more
impression
on
his
big
face
than
it
would
have
do
on
an
elephant
's
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
she
make
'em
,
now
?
"
say
Mr
Barkis
,
always
lean
forward
,
in
his
slouch
way
,
on
the
footboard
of
the
cart
with
an
arm
on
each
knee
.
   
<EOS>
"
Peggotty
,
do
you
mean
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
say
Mr
Barkis
.
 
<EOS>
"
Her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
 
<EOS>
She
make
all
our
pastry
,
and
do
all
our
cooking
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
she
though
?
"
say
Mr
Barkis
.
<EOS>
He
make
up
his
mouth
as
if
to
whistle
,
but
he
do
not
whistle
.
 
<EOS>
He
sit
look
at
the
horse
's
ear
,
as
if
he
see
something
new
there
;
and
sit
so
,
for
a
considerable
time
.
 
<EOS>
by
and
by
<EOS>
,
he
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
no
sweetheart
,
I
b'lieve
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
sweetmeat
do
you
say
,
Mr
Barkis
?
"
 
<EOS>
for
I
think
he
want
something
else
to
eat
,
and
have
pointedly
allude
to
that
description
of
refreshment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hearts
,
"
say
Mr
Barkis
.
 
<EOS>
"
sweet
heart
;
no
person
walk
with
her

"
   
<EOS>
"
with
Peggotty
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
ah

"
<EOS>
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
Her

"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
She

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
not

,
though
!
"
say
Mr
Barkis
.
   
<EOS>
again
he
make
up
his
mouth
to
whistle
,
and
again
he
do
not
whistle
,
but
sit
look
at
the
horse
's
ear
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
she
make
,
"
say
Mr
Barkis
,
after
a
long
interval
of
reflection
,
"
all
the
apple
parstie
,
and
doo
all
the
cooking

do
she
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
reply
that
such
be
the
fact
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well

<EOS>
I
will
tell

say
Mr

<EOS>
"

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
certainly

"
I
rejoin
.
   
<EOS>
"
ah

"
<EOS>
he
say
,
slowly
turn
his
eye
towards
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
!
 
<EOS>
if
you
be
writin

p'raps
you

"
   
<EOS>
"
that

I
repeat
,
innocently
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
that
all
the
message

"
   
<EOS>
"
Ye

he

,
consider

<EOS>
"
Ye

.
"
   
<EOS>
"
but
you
will
be
at
Blunderstone
again
tomorrow
,
Mr
Barkis
,
"
I
say
,
falter
a
little
at
the
idea
of
my
be
far
away
from
it
then
,
"
and
could
give
your
own
message
so
much
well
.
"
   
<EOS>
as
he
repudiate
this
suggestion
,
however
,
with
a
jerk
of
his
head
,
and
once
more
confirm
his
previous
request
by
say
,
with
profound
gravity
,
"
Barkis
be
willin
'
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
message
,
"
I
readily
undertake
its
transmission
.
 
<EOS>
while
I
be
wait
for
the
coach
in
the
hotel
at
Yarmouth
that
very
afternoon
,
I
procure
a
sheet
of
paper
and
an
inkstand
,
and
write
a
note
to
Peggotty
,
which
run
thus
:
"
My
dear
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
come
here
safe
.
 
<EOS>
Barkis
be
willing
.
 
<EOS>
My
love
to
mama
.
 
<EOS>
yours
affectionately
.
 
<EOS>
PS
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
he
particularly
want
you
to
know
<EOS>
---
BARKIS
be
WILLING
.
"
   
<EOS>
when
I
have
take
this
commission
on
myself
prospectively
,
Mr
Barkis
relapse
into
perfect
silence
;
and
I
,
feel
quite
wear
out
by
all
that
have
happen
lately
,
lie
down
on
a
sack
in
the
cart
and
fall
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
I
sleep
soundly
until
we
get
to
Yarmouth
;
which
be
so
entirely
new
and
strange
to
me
in
the
inn
-
yard
to
which
we
drive
,
that
I
at
once
abandon
a
latent
hope
I
have
have
of
meeting
with
some
of
Mr
Peggotty
's
family
there
,
perhaps
even
with
little
em'ly
herself
.
   
<EOS>
the
coach
be
in
the
yard
,
shine
very
much
all
over
,
but
without
any
horse
to
it
as
yet
;
and
it
look
in
that
state
as
if
nothing
be
more
unlikely
than
its
ever
go
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
think
this
,
and
wonder
what
would
ultimately
become
of
my
box
,
which
Mr
Barkis
have
put
down
on
the
yard
-
pavement
by
the
pole
(
he
have
drive
up
the
yard
to
turn
his
cart
)
,
and
also
what
would
ultimately
become
of
me
,
when
a
lady
look
out
of
a
bow
-
window
where
some
fowl
and
joint
of
meat
be
hang
up
,
and
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
be
that
the
little
gentleman
from
Blunderstone
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
madam
,
"
I
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
name
?
<EOS>
"
inquire
the
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
Copperfield
,
madam
,
"
I
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
will
not
do
,
"
return
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
nobody
's
dinner
be
pay
for
here
,
in
that
name
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
be
it
Murdstone
,
madam
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
you
be
Master
Murdstone
,
"
say
the
lady
,
"
why
do
you
go
and
give
another
name
,
first
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
explain
to
the
lady
how
it
be
,
who
than
rang
a
bell
,
and
call
out
,
"
William
!
<EOS>
show
the
coffee
-
room
!
"
<EOS>
upon
which
a
waiter
come
run
out
of
a
kitchen
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
yard
to
show
it
,
and
seem
a
good
deal
surprise
when
he
be
only
to
show
it
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
large
long
room
with
some
large
map
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
if
I
could
have
feel
much
strange
if
the
map
have
be
real
foreign
country
,
and
I
cast
away
in
the
middle
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
it
be
take
a
liberty
to
sit
down
,
with
my
cap
in
my
hand
,
on
the
corner
of
the
chair
nearest
the
door
;
and
when
the
waiter
lay
a
cloth
on
purpose
for
me
,
and
put
a
set
of
castor
on
it
,
I
think
I
must
have
turn
red
all
over
with
modesty
.
   
<EOS>
He
bring
me
some
chop
,
and
vegetable
,
and
take
the
cover
off
in
such
a
bouncing
manner
that
I
be
afraid
I
must
have
give
him
some
offence
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
greatly
relieve
my
mind
by
put
a
chair
for
me
at
the
table
,
and
say
,
very
affably
,
"
now
,
six
-
foot
!
<EOS>
come
on
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
thank
him
,
and
take
my
seat
at
the
board
;
but
find
it
extremely
difficult
to
handle
my
knife
and
fork
with
anything
like
dexterity
,
or
to
avoid
splash
myself
with
the
gravy
,
while
he
be
stand
opposite
,
stare
so
hard
,
and
make
me
blush
in
the
most
dreadful
manner
every
time
I
catch
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
after
watch
me
into
the
second
chop
,
he
say
:
   
<EOS>
"
there
be
half
a
pint
of
ale
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
have
it
now
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
thank
him
and
say
,
"
yes
.
"
 
<EOS>
upon
which
he
pour
it
out
of
a
jug
into
a
large
tumbler
,
and
hold
it
up
against
the
light
,
and
make
it
look
beautiful
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
eye
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
seem
a
good
deal
,
do
not
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
do
seem
a
good
deal
,
"
I
answer
with
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
for
it
be
quite
delightful
to
me
,
to
find
him
so
pleasant
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
twinkling
-
eyed
,
pimple
-
faced
man
,
with
his
hair
stand
upright
all
over
his
head
;
and
as
he
stand
with
one
arm
a
-
kimbo
,
hold
up
the
glass
to
the
light
with
the
other
hand
,
he
look
quite
friendly
.
   
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
gentleman
here
,
yesterday
,
"
he
say
---
"
a
stout
gentleman
,
by
the
name
of
Topsawyer
---
perhaps
you
know
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
<EOS>
,
"
I
say
,
"
I
do
not
think
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
in
breech
and
gaiter
,
broad
-
brim
hat
,
grey
coat
,
speckle
choker
,
"
say
the
waiter
.
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
I
say
bashfully
,
"
I
have
not
the
pleasure
---
"
   
"
He
come
in
here
,
"
say
the
waiter
,
look
at
the
light
through
the
tumbler
,
"
order
a
glass
of
this
ale
---
<EOS>
WOULD
order
it
---
I
tell
him
not
---
drank
it
,
and
fall
dead
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
too
old
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
ought
not
to
be
draw
;
that
be
the
fact
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
shocked
to
hear
of
this
melancholy
accident
,
and
say
I
think
I
have
better
have
some
water
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
you
see
,
"
say
the
waiter
,
still
look
at
the
light
through
the
tumbler
,
with
one
of
his
eye
shut
up
,
"
our
people
do
not
like
thing
be
order
and
leave
.
 
<EOS>
It
offend
'em
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
drink
it
,
if
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
used
to
it
,
and
use
be
everything
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
it
will
hurt
me
,
if
I
throw
my
head
back
,
and
take
it
off
quick
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
reply
that
he
would
much
oblige
me
by
drink
it
,
if
he
think
he
could
do
it
safely
,
but
by
no
means
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
do
throw
his
head
back
,
and
take
it
off
quick
,
I
have
a
horrible
fear
,
I
confess
,
of
see
him
meet
the
fate
of
the
lament
Mr
Topsawyer
,
and
fall
lifeless
on
the
carpet
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
do
not
hurt
him
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
I
think
he
seem
the
fresher
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
have
we
get
here
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
put
a
fork
into
my
dish
.
"
<EOS>
not
chop
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Chops
,
"
I
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
my
soul
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
,
"
I
do
not
know
they
be
chop
.
<EOS>
why
,
a
chop
be
the
very
thing
to
take
off
the
bad
effect
of
that
beer
!
 
<EOS>
be
not
it
lucky
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
so
he
take
a
chop
by
the
bone
in
one
hand
,
and
a
potato
in
the
other
,
and
eat
away
with
a
very
good
appetite
,
to
my
extreme
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
He
afterwards
take
another
chop
,
and
another
potato
;
and
after
that
,
another
chop
and
another
potato
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
have
do
,
he
bring
me
a
pudding
,
and
have
set
it
before
me
,
seem
to
ruminate
,
and
to
become
absent
in
his
mind
for
some
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
how
be
the
pie
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
rouse
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
pudding
,
"
I
make
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
pudding
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
.
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
the

certainly
get
most
.
 
<EOS>
He
entreat
me
more
than
once
to
come
in
and
win
,
but
what
with
his
table
-
spoon

my
tea

spoon

appetite
to
my
appetite

I
be
leave
far
behind
at
the
first
mouthful
,
and
have
no
chance
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
anyone
enjoy
a
pudding
so
much
,
I
think
;
and
he
laugh
,
when
it
be
all
go
,
as
if
his
enjoyment
of
it
last
still
.
   
<EOS>
find
him
so
very
friendly
and
companionable
,
it
be
then
that
I
ask
for
the
pen
and
ink
and
paper

to
write
to
Peggotty

<EOS>
He
not
only
bring
it
immediately
,
but
be
good
enough
to
look
over
me
while
I
write
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
finish
it
,
he
ask
me
where
I
be
go
to
school

<EOS>
I
say
,
"
Near
London

all
I

spirited

I
ask

<EOS>
I
could
not
disguise
from
myself
,
or
from
the
waiter
,
that
this
be
an
uncomfortable
coincidence

inquire
how
it

His
answer
be
not
cheer

for
it
consist
of
two
dismal

with
whopping

"
   
<EOS>
the
blowing
of
the
coach

horn
in
the
yard
be
a
seasonable
diversion
,
which
make
me
get
up
and
hesitatingly
inquire
,
in
the
mingled
pride
and
diffidence
of
have
a
purse
(
which
I
take
out
of
my
pocket
)
,
if
there
be
anything
to

<EOS>
"
do
you

<EOS>
I
could
not

Threepence

there
be
nothing

the

never
mind
the
ink

I
lose
by
that

it
be
right

pay
the
waiter
,
if
you
please

"
I
stammer
,
blush
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
I
have
not
a
family
,
and
that
family
have
not
the
cowpock
,
"
say
the
waiter
,
"
I
would
not
take
a
sixpence
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
do
not
support
a
aged
pairint
,

a
lovely
sister
,
"

here
the

greatly

I
would
not
take
a
farthing
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
a
good
place
,
and
be
treat
well
here
,
I
should
beg
acceptance
of
a
trifle
,
instead
of
take
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
live
on
broken
wittle
---
<EOS>
and
I
sleep
on
the
coal
"
---
<EOS>
here
the
waiter
burst
into
tear
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
concerned
for
his
misfortune
,
and
feel
that
any
recognition
short
of
ninepence
would
be
mere
brutality
and
hardness
of
heart
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
I
give
him
one
of
my
three
bright
shilling
,
which
he
receive
with
much
humility
and
veneration
,
and
spin
up
with
his
thumb
,
directly
afterwards
,
to
try
the
goodness
of
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
little
disconcert
to
me
,
to
find
,
when
I
be
be
help
up
behind
the
coach
,
that
I
be
suppose
to
have
eat
all
the
dinner
without
any
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
I
discover
this
,
from
overhear
the
lady
in
the
bow
-
window
<EOS>
say
to
the
guard
,
"
take
care
of
that
child
,
George
,
or
he
will
burst
!
"
<EOS>
and
from
observe
that
the
woman
-
servant
who
be
about
the
place
come
out
to
look
and
giggle
at
me
as
a
young
phenomenon
.
 
<EOS>
My
unfortunate
friend
the
waiter
,
who
have
quite
recover
his
spirit
,
do
not
appear
to
be
disturb
by
this
,
but
join
in
the
general
admiration
without
be
at
all
confuse
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
any
doubt
of
him
,
I
suppose
this
half
awaken
it
;
but
I
be
incline
to
believe
that
with
the
simple
confidence
of
a
child
,
and
the
natural
reliance
of
a
child
upon
superior
year
(
quality
I
be
very
sorry
any
child
should
prematurely
change
for
worldly
wisdom
)
,
I
have
no
serious
mistrust
of
him
on
the
whole
,
even
then
.
   
<EOS>
I
feel
it
rather
hard
,
I
must
own
,
to
be
make
,
without
deserve
it
,
the
subject
of
joke
between
the
coachman
and
guard
as
to
the
coach
draw
heavy
behind
,
on
account
of
my
sit
there
,
and
as
to
the
great
expediency
of
my
travelling
by
waggon
.
 
<EOS>
the
story
of
my
suppose
appetite
get
wind
among
the
outside
passenger
<EOS>
,
they
be
merry
upon
it
likewise
;
and
ask
me
whether
I
be
go
to
be
pay
for
,
at
school
,
as
two
brother
or
three
,
and
whether
I
be
contract
for
,
or
go
upon
the
regular
term
;
with
other
pleasant
question
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
bad
of
it
be
,
that
I
know
I
should
be
ashamed
to
eat
anything
,
when
an
opportunity
offer
,
and
that
,
after
a
rather
light
dinner
,
I
should
remain
hungry
all
night
---
for
I
have
leave
my
cake
behind
,
at
the
hotel
,
in
my
hurry
.
 
<EOS>
My
apprehension
be
realize
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
stop
for
supper
I
could
not
muster
courage
to
take
any
,
though
I
should
have
like
it
very
much
,
but
sit
by
the
fire
and
say
I
do
not
want
anything
.
 
<EOS>
this
do
not
save
me
from
more
joke
,
either
;
for
a
husky
-
voiced
gentleman
with
a
rough
face
,
who
have
be
eat
out
of
a
sandwich
-
box
nearly
all
the
way
,
except
when
he
have
be
drink
out
of
a
bottle
,
say
I
be
like
a
boa
-
constrictor
who
take
enough
at
one
meal
to
last
him
a
long
time
;
after
which
,
he
actually
bring
a
rash
out
upon
himself
with
boil
beef
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
start
from
Yarmouth
at
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
and
we
be
due
in
London
about
eight
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Mid
-
summer
weather
,
and
the
evening
be
very
pleasant
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
pass
through
a
village
,
I
picture
to
myself
what
the
inside
of
the
house
be
like
,
and
what
the
inhabitant
be
about
;
and
when
boy
come
run
after
us
,
and
get
up
behind
and
swing
there
for
a
little
way
,
I
wonder
whether
their
father
be
alive
,
and
whether
they
be
happy
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
plenty
to
think
of
,
therefore
,
besides
my
mind
run
continually
on
the
kind
of
place
I
be
go
to
---
which
be
an
awful
speculation
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
I
remember
,
I
resign
myself
to
thought
of
home
and
Peggotty
;
and
to
endeavour
,
in
a
confused
blind
way
,
to
recall
how
I
have
feel
,
and
what
sort
of
boy
I
use
to
be
,
<EOS>
before
I
bite
Mr
Murdstone
:
which
I
could
not
satisfy
myself
about
by
any
mean
,
I
seem
to
have
bite
him
in
such
a
remote
antiquity
.
   
<EOS>
the
night
be
not
so
pleasant
as
the
evening
,
for
it
get
chilly
;
and
be
put
between
two
gentleman
(
the
rough
-
face
one
and
another
)
to
prevent
my
tumbling
off
the
coach
,
I
be
nearly
smother
by
their
fall
asleep
,
and
completely
block
me
up
.
<EOS>
They
squeeze
me
so
hard
sometimes
,
that
I
could
not
help
cry
out
,
"
oh
!
 
<EOS>
if
you
please
!
"
---
which
they
do
not
like
at
all
,
because
it
wake
them
.
 
<EOS>
opposite
<EOS>
me
be
an
elderly
lady
in
a
great
fur
cloak
,
who
look
in
the
dark
more
like
a
haystack
than
a
lady
<EOS>
,
she
be
wrap
up
to
such
a
degree
.
 
<EOS>
this
lady
have
a
basket
with
her
,
and
she
have
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
,
for
a
long
time
,
until
she
find
that
on
account
of
my
leg
be
short
,
it
could
go
underneath
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
cramp
and
hurt
me
so
,
that
it
make
me
perfectly
miserable
;
but
if
I
move
in
the
least
,
and
make
a
glass
that
be
in
the
basket
rattle
against
something
else
(
as
it
be
sure
to
do
)
,
she
give
me
the
cruell
poke
with
her
foot
,
and
say
,
"
come
,
do
not
you
fidget
.
 
<EOS>
your
bone
be
young
enough
,
I
be
sure
!
"
   
<EOS>
at
last
the
sun
rise
,
and
then
my
companion
seem
to
sleep
easy
.
 
<EOS>
the
difficulty
under
which
they
have
labour
all
night
,
and
which
have
find
utterance
in
the
most
terrific
gasp
and
snort
,
be
not
to
be
conceive
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
sun
get
high
,
their
sleep
become
light
,
and
so
they
gradually
one
by
one
awoke
.
 
<EOS>
I
recollect
be
very
much
surprised
by
the
feint
everybody
make
,
then
,
of
not
have
be
to
sleep
at
all
,
and
by
the
uncommon
indignation
with
which
everyone
repel
the
charge
.
 
<EOS>
I
labour
under
the
same
kind
of
astonishment
to
this
day
,
have
invariably
observe
that
of
all
human
weakness
,
<EOS>
the
one
to
which
our
common
nature
be
the
least
disposed
to
confess
<EOS>
(
I
can
not
imagine
why
)
be
the
weakness
of
have
go
to
sleep
in
a
coach
.
   
<EOS>
what
an
amazing
place
London
be
to
me
when
I
see
it
in
the
distance
,
and
how
I
believe
all
the
adventure
of
all
my
favourite
hero
to
be
constantly
enact
and
re
-
enact
there
,
and
how
I
vaguely
make
it
out
in
my
own
mind
to
be
full
of
wonder
and
wickedness
than
all
the
city
of
the
earth
,
I
need
not
stop
here
to
relate
.
 
<EOS>
We
approach
it
by
degree
,
and
get
,
in
due
time
,
to
the
inn
in
the
Whitechapel
district
,
for
which
we
be
bind
.
 
<EOS>
I
forget
whether
it
be
the
Blue
Bull
,
or
the
Blue
Boar
;
but
I
know
it
be
the
Blue
Something
,
and
that
its
likeness
be
paint
up
on
the
back
of
the
coach
.
   
<EOS>
the
guard
's
eye
light
on
me
as
he
be
get
down
,
and
he
say
at
the
booking
-
office
door
:
   
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
<EOS>

<EOS>
no

there

<EOS>
I
look
anxiously
around
;
but
the
inquiry
make
no
impression
on
any
of
the
bystander
,
if
I
except
a
man
in
gaiter
,
with
one
eye
,
who
suggest
that
they
have
better
put
a
brass
collar
round
my
neck
,
and
tie
me
up
in
the
stable
.
   
<EOS>
a
ladder
be
bring
,
and
I
get
down
after
the
lady
,
who
be
like
a
haystack
:
not
daring
to
stir
,
until
her
basket
be
remove
.
 
<EOS>
the
coach
be
clear
of
passenger
by
that
time
,
the
luggage
be
very
soon
clear
out
,
the
horse
have
be
take
out
before
the
luggage
,
and
now
the
coach
itself
be
wheel
and
back
off
by
some
hostler
,
out
of
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
nobody
appear
,
to
claim
the
dusty
youngster
from
Blunderstone
,
Suffolk
.
   
<EOS>
more
solitary
than
Robinson
Crusoe
,
who
have
nobody
to
look
at
him
and
see
that
he
be
solitary
<EOS>
,
I
go
into
the
booking
-
office
,
and
,
by
invitation
of
the
clerk
on
duty
,
pass
behind
the
counter
,
and
sit
down
on
the
scale
at
which
they
weigh
the
luggage
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
as
I
sit
look
at
the
parcel
,
package
,
and
book
,
and
inhale
the
smell
of
stable
(
ever
since
associate
with
that
morning
)
,
a
procession
of
most
tremendous
consideration
begin
to
march
through
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
suppose
nobody
should
ever
fetch
me
,
how
long
would
they
consent
to
keep
me
there
?
 
<EOS>
Would
they
keep
me
long
enough
to
spend
seven
shilling
?
 
<EOS>
Should
I
sleep
at
night
in
one
of
those
wooden
bin
,
with
the
other
luggage
,
and
wash
myself
at
the
pump
in
the
yard
in
the
morning
;
or
should
I
be
turn
out
every
night
,
and
expect
to
come
again
to
be
leave
till
call
for
,
when
the
office
open
next
day
?
 
<EOS>
supposing
there
be
no
mistake
in
the
case
,
and
Mr
Murdstone
have
devise
this
plan
to
get
rid
of
me
,
what
should
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
if
they
allow
me
to
remain
there
until
my
seven
shilling
be
spend
,
I
could
not
hope
to
remain
there
when
I
begin
to
starve
.
<EOS>
that
would
obviously
be
inconvenient
and
unpleasant
to
the
customer
,
besides
entail
on
the
Blue
Whatever
-
it
-
be
,
the
risk
of
funeral
expense
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
start
off
at
once
,
and
try
to
walk
back
home
,
how
could
I
ever
find
my
way
,
how
could
I
ever
hope
to
walk
so
far
<EOS>
,
how
could
I
make
sure
of
anyone
but
Peggotty
,
even
if
I
get
back
?
 
<EOS>
if
I
find
out
the
near
proper
authority
,
and
offer
myself
to
go
for
a
soldier
,
or
a
sailor
,
I
be
such
a
little
fellow
that
it
be
most
likely
they
would
not
take
me
in
.
<EOS>
these
thought
,
and
a
hundred
other
such
thought
,
turn
me
burn
hot
,
and
make
me
giddy
with
apprehension
and
dismay
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
in
the
height
of
my
fever
when
a
man
enter
and
whisper
to
the
clerk
,
who
presently
slant
me
off
the
scale
,
and
push
me
over
to
him
,
as
if
I
be
weigh
,
buy
,
deliver
,
and
pay
for
.
   
<EOS>
as
I
go
out
of
the
office
,
hand
in
hand
with
this
new
acquaintance
,
I
steal
a
look
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
gaunt
,
sallow
young
man
,
with
hollow
cheek
,
and
a
chin
almost
as
black
as
Mr
Murdstone
's
;
but
there
the
likeness
end
,
for
his
whisker
be
shave
off
,
and
his
hair
,
instead
of
be
glossy
,
be
rusty
and
dry
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
dress
in
a
suit
of
black
clothe
which
be
rather
rusty
and
dry
too
,
and
rather
short
in
the
sleeve
and
leg
;
and
he
have
a
white
neck
-
kerchief
on
,
that
be
not
over
-
clean
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
,
and
do
not
,
suppose
that
this
neck
-
kerchief
be
all
the
linen
he
wear
,
but
it
be
all
he
show
or
give
any
hint
of
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
the
new
boy
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
"
I
say
.
   
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
one
of
the
master
at
Salem
House
,
"
he
say
.
   
<EOS>
I
make
him
a
bow
and
feel
very
much
overawe
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
ashamed
to
allude
to
a
commonplace
thing
like
my
box
,
to
a
scholar
and
a
master
at
Salem
House
,
that
we
have
go
some
little
distance
from
the
yard
before
I
have
the
hardihood
to
mention
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
turn
back
,
on
my
humbly
insinuate
that
it
may
be
useful
to
me
hereafter
;
and
he
tell
the
clerk
that
the
carrier
have
instruction
to
call
for
it
at
noon
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
you
please
,
sir
,
"
I
say
,
when
we
have
accomplish
about
the
same
distance
as
before
,
"
be
it
far
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
down
by
Blackheath
,
"
he
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
that
far
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
diffidently
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
good
step
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
go
by
the
stage
-
coach
.
<EOS>
It
be
about
six
mile
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
so
faint
and
tired
,
that
the
idea
of
hold
out
for
six
mile
more
,
be
too
much
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
heart
to
tell
him
that
I
have
have
nothing
all
night
,
and
that
if
he
would
allow
me
to
buy
something
to
eat
,
I
should
be
very
much
oblige
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
appear
surprised
at
this
<EOS>
---
I
see
him
stop
and
look
at
me
now
---
and
after
consider
for
a
few
moment
,
say
he
want
to
call
on
an
old
person
who
live
not
far
off
,
and
that
the
good
way
would
be
for
me
to
buy
some
bread
,
or
whatever
I
like
best
<EOS>
that
be
wholesome
,
and
make
my
breakfast
at
her
house
,
where
we
could
get
some
milk
.
   
<EOS>
accordingly
we
look
in
at
a
baker
's
window
,
and
after
I
have
make
a
series
of
proposal
to
buy
everything
that
be
bilious
in
the
shop
,
and
he
have
reject
them
one
by
one
<EOS>
,
we
decide
in
favour
of
a
nice
little
loaf
of
brown
bread
,
which
cost
me
threepence
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
at
a
grocer
's
shop
,
we
buy
an
egg
and
a
slice
of
streaky
bacon
;
which
still
leave
what
I
think
a
good
deal
of
change
,
out
of
the
second
of
the
bright
shilling
,
and
make
me
consider
London
a
very
cheap
place
.
 
<EOS>
these
provision
lay
in
,
we
go
on
through
a
great
noise
and
uproar
that
confuse
my
weary
head
beyond
description
,
and
over
a
bridge
which
,
no
doubt
,
be
London
Bridge
(
indeed
I
think
he
tell
me
so
,
<EOS>
but
I
be
half
asleep
)
,
until
we
come
to
the
poor
person
's
house
,
which
be
a
part
of
some
alm
-
house
,
as
I
know
by
their
look
,
and
by
an
inscription
on
a
stone
over
the
gate
which
say
they
be
establish
for
twenty
-
five
poor
woman
.
   
<EOS>
the
Master
at
Salem
House
lift
the
latch
of
one
of
a
number
of
little
black
door
that
be
all
alike
,
and
have
each
a
little
diamond
-
pan
window
on
one
side
,
and
another
little
diamond
-
pan
window
above
;
and
we
go
into
the
little
house
of
one
of
these
poor
old
woman
,
who
be
blow
a
fire
to
make
a
little
saucepan
boil
.
 
<EOS>
on
see
the
master
enter
,
the
old
woman
stop
with
the
bellow
on
her
knee
,
and
say
something
that
I
think
sound
like
"
My
Charley
!
"
<EOS>
but
on
see
me
come
in
too
,
she
get
up
,
and
rub
her
hand
make
a
confused
sort
of
half
curtsey
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
you
cook
this
young
gentleman
's
breakfast
for
him
,
if
you
please
?
"
say
the
Master
at
Salem
House
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
I
?
"
say
the
old
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
can
I
,
sure
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
how
be
Mrs
Fibbitson
today
?
"
say
the
Master
,
look
at
another
old
woman
in
a
large
chair
by
the
fire
,
who
be
such
a
bundle
of
clothe
that
I
feel
grateful
to
this
hour
for
not
have
sit
upon
her
by
mistake
.
   
<EOS>
"
ah
,
she
be
poorly
,
"
say
the
first
old
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
one
of
her
bad
day
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
fire
be
to
go
out
,
through
any
accident
,
I
verily
believe
she
would
go
out
too
,
and
never
come
to
life
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
as
they
look
at
her
,
I
look
at
her
also
.
 
<EOS>
although
it
be
a
warm
day
,
she
seem
to
think
of
nothing
but
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
she
be
jealous
even
of
the
saucepan
on
it
;
and
I
have
reason
to
know
that
she
take
its
impressment
into
the
service
of
boil
my
egg
and
broil
my
bacon
,
in
dudgeon
;
for
I
see
her
,
with
my
own
discomfited
eye
,
shake
her
fist
at
me
once
,
when
those
culinary
operation
be
go
on
,
and
no
one
else
be
look
.
 
<EOS>
the
sun
stream
in
at
the
little
window
,
but
she
sit
with
her
own
back
<EOS>
and
the
back
of
the
large
chair
towards
it
,
screen
the
fire
as
if
she
be
sedulously
keep
it
warm
,
instead
of
<EOS>
it
keep
her
warm
,
and
watch
it
in
a
most
distrustful
manner
.
 
<EOS>
the
completion
of
the
preparation
for
my
breakfast
,
by
relieve
the
fire
,
give
her
such
extreme
joy
that
she
laugh
aloud
---
and
a
very
unmelodious
laugh
she
have
,
I
must
say
.
   
<EOS>
I
sit
down
to
my
brown
loaf
,
my
egg
,
and
my
rasher
of
bacon
,
with
a
basin
of
milk
besides
,
and
make
a
most
delicious
meal
.
 
<EOS>
while
I
be
yet
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
it
,
the
old
woman
of
the
house
say
to
the
Master
:
   
<EOS>
"
have
you
get
your
flute
with
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
he
return
.
   
<EOS>
"
have
a
blow
at
it
,
"
say
the
old
woman
,
coaxingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
the
Master
,
upon
this
,
put
his
hand
underneath
the
skirt
of
his
coat
,
and
bring
out
his
flute
in
three
piece
,
which
he
screw
together
,
and
begin
immediately
to
play
.
 
<EOS>
My
impression
be
,
after
many
year
of
consideration
,
that
there
never
can
have
be
anybody
in
the
world
who
play
worse
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
the
most
dismal
sound
I
have
ever
hear
produce
by
any
mean
,
natural
or
artificial
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
the
tune
be
---
if
there
be
such
thing
in
the
performance
at
all
,
which
I
doubt
---
<EOS>
but
the
influence
of
the
strain
upon
me
be
,
first
,
to
make
me
think
of
all
my
sorrow
until
I
could
hardly
keep
my
tear
back
;
then
to
take
away
my
appetite
;
and
lastly
,
to
make
me
so
sleepy
that
I
could
not
keep
my
eye
open
.
<EOS>
They
begin
to
close
again
,
and
I
begin
to
nod
,
as
the
recollection
rise
fresh
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
once
more
the
little
room
,
with
its
open
corner
cupboard
,
and
its
square
-
back
chair
,
and
its
angular
little
staircase
lead
to
the
room
above
,
and
<EOS>
its
three
peacock
's
feather
display
over
the
mantelpiece
---
I
remember
wonder
when
I
first
go
in
,
what
that
peacock
would
have
think
if
he
have
know
what
his
finery
be
doom
to
come
to
---
<EOS>
fade
from
before
me
,
and
I
nod
,
and
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
the
flute
become
inaudible
,
the
wheel
of
the
coach
be
hear
instead
,
and
I
be
on
my
journey
.
 
<EOS>
the
coach
jolt
,
I
wake
with
a
start
,
and
the
flute
have
come
back
again
,
and
the
Master
at
Salem
House
be
sit
with
his
leg
cross
,
play
it
dolefully
,
while
the
old
woman
of
the
house
look
on
delighted
.
<EOS>
She
fade
in
her
turn
,
and
he
fade
,
and
all
fade
,
and
there
be
no
flute
,
no
Master
,
no
Salem
House
,
no
David
Copperfield
,
no
anything
but
heavy
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
I
dream
,
I
think
,
that
once
while
he
be
blow
into
this
dismal
flute
,
the
old
woman
of
the
house
,
who
have
go
near
and
near
to
him
in
her
ecstatic
admiration
,
lean
over
the
back
of
his
chair
and
give
him
an
affectionate
squeeze
round
the
neck
,
which
stop
his
playing
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
in
the
middle
state
between
sleep
and
wake
,
either
then
or
immediately
afterwards
;
for
,
as
he
resume
---
it
be
a
real
fact
that
he
have
stop
play
---
I
see
and
hear
the
same
old
woman
ask
Mrs
Fibbitson
if
it
be
not
delicious
(
mean
the
flute
)
,
to
which
Mrs
Fibbitson
reply
,
"
ay
,
ay
!
yes
!
"
and
nod
at
the
fire
:
to
which
,
I
be
persuade
,
she
give
the
credit
of
the
whole
performance
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
seem
to
have
be
doze
a
long
while
,
the
Master
at
Salem
House
unscrew
his
flute
into
the
three
piece
,
put
them
up
as
before
,
and
take
me
away
.
 
<EOS>
We
find
the
coach
very
near
at
hand
,
and
get
upon
the
roof
;
but
I
be
so
dead
sleepy
,
that
when
we
stop
on
the
road
to
take
up
somebody
else
,
they
put
me
inside
where
there
be
no
passenger
,
and
where
I
sleep
profoundly
,
until
I
find
the
coach
go
at
a
footpace
up
a
steep
hill
among
green
leave
.
 
<EOS>
presently
,
it
stop
,
and
have
come
to
its
destination
.
   
<EOS>
a
short
walk
bring
us
---
<EOS>
I
mean
the
Master
and
me
---
to
Salem
House
,
which
be
enclose
with
a
high
brick
wall
,
and
look
very
dull
.
 
<EOS>
over
a
door
in
this
wall
be
a
board
with
SALEM
house
upon
it
;
and
through
a
grating
in
this
door
we
be
survey
when
we
ring
the
bell
by
a
surly
face
,
which
I
find
,
on
the
door
be
open
,
belong
to
a
stout
man
with
a
bull
-
neck
,
a
wooden
leg
,
overhang
temple
,
and
his
hair
cut
close
all
round
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
new
boy
,
"
say
the
Master
.
   
<EOS>
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
eye
me
all
over
---
it
do
not
take
long
,
for
there
be
not
much
of
me
---
and
lock
the
gate
behind
us
,
and
take
out
the
key
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
go
up
to
the
house
,
among
some
dark
heavy
tree
,
when
he
call
after
my
conductor
.
<EOS>
"
hallo
!
"
   
<EOS>
We
look
back
,
and
he
be
stand
at
the
door
of
a
little
lodge
,
where
he
live
,
with
a
pair
of
boot
in
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
!
 
<EOS>
the
cobbler
be
be
,
"
he
say
,
"
since
you
have
be
out
,
Mr
Mell
,
and
he
say
he
can
not
mend
'em
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
there
be
not
a
bit
of
the
original
boot
leave
,
and
he
wonder
you
expect
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
with
these
word
he
throw
the
boot
towards
Mr
Mell
,
who
go
back
a
few
pace
to
pick
them
up
,
and
look
at
them
(
very
disconsolately
<EOS>
,
I
be
afraid
)
,
as
we
go
on
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
observe
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
the
boot
he
have
on
be
a
good
deal
the
bad
for
wear
,
and
that
his
stocking
be
just
break
out
in
one
place
,
like
a
bud
.

House
be
a
square
brick
building
with
wing
;
of
a
bare
and
unfurnished
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
all
about
it
be
so
very
quiet
,
that
I
say
to
Mr
Mell
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
boy
be
out
;
but
he
seem
surprised
at
my
not
know
that
it
be
holiday
-
time
.
 
<EOS>
that
all
the

be
at
their
several
home

that
Mr
Creakle
,
the
proprietor
,
be
down
by
the

side
with
Mrs

Miss
Creakle
;
and
that
I
be
send
in
holiday
-
time
as
a
punishment
for
my
misdoing
,
all
of
which
he
explain
to
me
as
we
go
along
.
   
<EOS>
I
gaze
upon
the
schoolroom
into
which
he
take
me
,
as
the
most
forlorn
and
desolate
place
I
have
ever
see
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
a
long
room
with
three
long
row
of
desk
,
and
six
of
form
,
and
bristle
all
round
with
peg
for
hat
and
slate
.
 
<EOS>
Scraps

miserable
little

,
be
run
up
and
down
in
a
fusty
castle
make
of
pasteboard
and
wire
,
look
in
all
the
corner
with
their
red
eye
for
anything
to
eat
.
 
<EOS>
a
bird

a
mournful
rattle
now
and
then
in
hop
on
his
perch
,
two
inch
high
,
or
drop
from
it
;
but
neither
sings
nor
chirps
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
strange
unwholesome
smell
upon
the
room
,
like
mildewed
corduroy
,
sweet
apple
want
air
,
and
rotten
book
.
 
<EOS>
there
could
not
well
be
more
ink
splash
about
it
,
if
it
have
be
roofless
from
its
first
construction
,
and
the
sky
have
rain
,
snow
,
hail
,
and
blown

through
the
varying
season
of
the
year

<EOS>
Mr
Mell
have
leave
me
while
he
take
his
irreparable
boot
upstairs
,
I
go
softly
to
the
upper
end
of
the
room
,
observe
all
this
as
I
creep
along
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
I
come
upon
a
pasteboard
placard
,
beautifully
write
,
which
be
lie
on
the
desk
,
and
bear
these
word
:
"

<EOS>
he
BITES

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
get
upon
the
desk
immediately
,
apprehensive
of
at
least
a
great
dog
underneath
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
though
I
look
all
round
with
anxious
eye
,
I
could
see
nothing
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
still
engage
in
peer
about
,
when
Mr
Mell
come
back
,
and
ask
me
what
I
do
up
there
?
   
<EOS>
"
I

My

I
be
sorry
to
make
such
a

but
I
must
do
it

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
with
that
he
take
me
down
,
and
tie
the
placard
,
which
be
neatly
construct
for
the
purpose
,
on
my
shoulder
like
a
knapsack
;
and
wherever
I
go
,
afterwards
,
I
have
the
consolation
of
carry
it
.
   
<EOS>
what
I
suffer
from
that
placard
,
nobody
can
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
whether
it
be
possible
for
people
to
see
me
or
not
,
I
always
fancy
that
somebody
be
read
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
relief
to
turn
round
and
find
nobody
;
for
wherever
my
back
be

there
I
imagine
somebody
always
to
be

<EOS>
that
cruel
man
with
the
wooden
leg
aggravate
my
suffering

<EOS>
He
be
in
authority
;
and
if
he
ever
see
me
lean
against
a
tree
,
or
a
wall
,
or
the
house

he
roar
out
from
his

door
in

stupendous
voice

the
playground
be
a
bare
gravel
yard
,
open
to
all
the
back
of
the
house
and
the
office
;
and
I
know
that
the
servant
read
it
,
and
the
butcher
read
it
,
and
the
baker
read
it
;
that
everybody
,
in
a
word
,
who
come
backwards
and
forwards
to
the
house
,
of
a
morning
when
I
be
order
to
walk
there
,
read
that
I
be
to
be
take
care
of
,
<EOS>
for
I
bite
,
I
recollect
that
I
positively
begin
to
have
a
dread
of
myself
,
as
a
kind
of
wild
boy
who
do
bite
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
an
old
door
in
this
playground
,
on
which
the
boy
have
a
custom
of
carve
their
name
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
completely
cover
with
such
inscription
.
 
<EOS>
in
my
dread
of
the
end
of
the
vacation
and
their
come
back
,
I
could
not
read
a
boy
's
name
,
without
inquire
in
what
tone
and
with
what
emphasis
he
would
read
,
"
take
care
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
bite
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
one
boy
---
a
certain
J
Steerforth
---
who
cut
his
name
very
deep
and
very
often
,
who
,
I
conceive
,
would
read
it
in
a
rather
strong
voice
,
and
afterwards
pull
my
hair
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
another
boy
,
one
Tommy
Traddles
,
who
I
dread
would
make
game
of
it
,
and
pretend
to
be
dreadfully
frightened
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
third
,
George
Demple
,
who
I
fancy
would
sing
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
look
,
a
little
shrink
creature
,
at
that
door
,
until
the
owner
of
all
the
name
---
there
be
five
-
and
-
forty
of
them
in
the
school
then
,
Mr
Mell
say
---
seem
to
send
me
to
Coventry
by
general
acclamation
,
and
to
cry
out
,
each
in
his
own
way
,
"
take
care
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
bite
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
the
same
with
the
place
at
the
desk
and
form
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
same
with
the
grove
of
deserted
bedstead
I
peep
at
,
on
my
way
to
,
and
when
I
be
in
,
my
own
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
dream
night
after
night
,
of
be
with
my
mother
as
she
use
to
be
,
or
of
go
to
a
party
at
Mr
Peggotty
's
,
or
of
travel
outside
the
stage
-
coach
,
or
of
dine
again
with
my
unfortunate
friend
the
waiter
,
and
in
all
these
circumstance
make
people
scream
and
stare
,
by
the
unhappy
disclosure
that
I
have
nothing
on
<EOS>
but
my
little
night
-
shirt
,
and
that
placard
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
monotony
of
my
life
,
and
in
my
constant
apprehension
of
the
re
-
opening
of
the
school
,
it
be
such
an
insupportable
affliction
!
<EOS>
I
have
long
task
every
day
to
do
with
Mr
Mell
;
but
I
do
them
,
there
be
no
Mr
and
Miss
Murdstone
here
,
and
get
through
them
without
disgrace
.
 
<EOS>
before
,
and
after
them
,
I
walk
about
---
supervise
,
as
I
have
mention
,
by
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
.
<EOS>
how
vividly
I
call
to
mind
the
damp
about
the
house
,
the
green
crack
flagstone
in
the
court
,
an
old
leaky
water
-
butt
,
and
the
discoloured
trunk
of
some
of
the
grim
tree
,
which
seem
to
have
drip
more
in
the
rain
than
other
tree
,
and
to
have
blow
less
in
the
sun
!
 
<EOS>
at
one
we
dine
,
Mr
Mell
and
I
,
at
the
upper
end
of
a
long
bare
dining
-
room
,
full
of
deal
table
,
and
smell
of
fat
.
<EOS>
then
,
we
have
more
task
until
tea
,
which
Mr
Mell
drink
out
of
a
blue
teacup
,
and
I
out
of
a
tin
pot
.
 
<EOS>
all
day
long
,
and
until
seven
or
eight
in
the
evening
,
Mr
Mell
,
at
his
own
detached
desk
in
the
schoolroom
,
work
hard
with
pen
,
ink
,
ruler
,
book
,
and
writing
-
paper
,
make
out
the
bill
(
as
I
find
)
for
last
half
-
year
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
put
up
his
thing
for
the
night
he
take
out
his
flute
,
and
blow
at
it
,
until
I
almost
think
he
would
gradually
blow
his
whole
being
into
the
large
hole
at
the
top
,
and
ooze
away
at
the
key
.
   
<EOS>
I
picture
my
small
self
in
the
dimly
-
light
room
,
sit
with
my
head
upon
my
hand
,
listen
to
the
doleful
performance
of
Mr
Mell
,
and
con
tomorrow
's
lesson
.
 
<EOS>
I
picture
myself
with
my
book
shut
up
,
still
listen
to
the
doleful
performance
of
Mr
Mell
,
and
listen
through
it
to
what
use
to
be
at
home
,
and
to
the
blowing
of
the
wind
on
Yarmouth
flat
,
and
feel
very
sad
and
solitary
.
 
<EOS>
I
picture
myself
go
up
to
bed
,
among
the
unused
room
,
and
sit
on
my
bed
-
side
cry
for
a
comfortable
word
from
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
I
picture
myself
come
downstairs
in
the
morning
,
and
look
through
a
long
ghastly
gash
of
a
staircase
window
at
the
school
-
bell
hang
on
the
top
of
an
out
-
house
with
a
weathercock
above
it
;
and
dread
the
time
when
it
shall
ring
J
Steerforth
and
the
rest
to
work
:
which
be
only
second
,
in
my
forebode
apprehension
,
to
the
time
when
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
shall
unlock
the
rusty
gate
to
give
admission
to
the
awful
Mr
Creakle
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
think
I
be
a
very
dangerous
character
in
any
of
these
aspect
,
but
in
all
of
them
I
carry
the
same
warning
on
my
back
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Mell
never
say
much
to
me
,
but
he
be
never
harsh
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
be
company
to
each
other
,
without
talk
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
mention
that
he
would
talk
to
himself
sometimes
,
and
grin
,
and
clench
his
fist
,
and
grind
his
tooth
,
and
pull
his
hair
in
an
unaccountable
manner
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
these
peculiarity
:
<EOS>
and
at
first
they
frighten
me
,
though
I
soon
get
use
to
them
.

Chapter
6
.
<EOS>
I
enlarge
my
circle
of
acquaintance
 
<EOS>
I
have
lead
this
life
about
a
month
,
when
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
begin
to
stump
about
with
a
mop
and
a
bucket
of
water
,
from
which
I
infer
that
preparation
be
make
to
receive
Mr
Creakle
and
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
mistake
;
for
the
mop
come
into
the
schoolroom
before
long
,
and
turn
out
Mr
Mell
and
me
,
who
live
where
we
could
,
and
get
on
how
we
could
,
for
some
day
,
during
which
we
be
always
in
the
way
of
two
or
three
young
woman
,
who
have
rarely
show
themselves
before
,
and
be
so
continually
in
the
midst
of
dust
that
I
sneeze
almost
as
much
as
if
Salem
House
have
be
a
great
snuff
-
box
.
   
<EOS>
one
day
I
be
inform
by
Mr
Mell
that
Mr
Creakle
would
be
home
that
evening
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
evening
,
after
tea
,
I
hear
that
he
be
come
.
<EOS>
before
bedtime
,
I
be
fetch
by
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
to
appear
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Creakle
's
part
of
the
house
be
a
good
deal
more
comfortable
than
ours
,
and
he
have
a
snug
bit
of
garden
that
look
pleasant
after
the
dusty
playground
,
which
be
such
a
desert
in
miniature
,
that
I
think
no
one
but
a
camel
,
or
a
dromedary
,
could
have
feel
at
home
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
a
bold
thing
even
to
take
notice
that
the
passage
look
comfortable
,
as
I
go
on
my
way
,
tremble
,
to
Mr
Creakle
's
presence
:
which
so
abash
me
,
when
I
be
usher
into
it
,
that
I
hardly
see
Mrs
Creakle
or
Miss
Creakle
(
who
be
both
there
,
in
the
parlour
)
,
or
anything
but
Mr
Creakle
,
a
stout
gentleman
with
a
bunch
of
watch
-
chain
and
seal
,
in
an
arm
-
chair
,
with
a
tumbler
and
bottle
beside
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
!
"
say
Mr
Creakle
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
the
young
gentleman
whose
tooth
be
to
be
file
!
 
<EOS>
turn
him
round
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
wooden
-
legged
man
turn
me
about
so
as
to
exhibit
the
placard
;
and
have
afford
time
for
a
full
survey
of
it
,
turn
me
about
again
,
with
my
face
to
Mr
Creakle
,
and
post
himself
at
Mr
Creakle
's
side
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Creakle
's
face
be
fiery
,
and
his
eye
be
small
,
and
deep
in
his
head
;
he
have
thick
vein
in
his
forehead
,
a
little
nose
,
and
a
large
chin
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
bald
on
the
top
of
his
head
;
and
have
some
thin
wet
-
looking
hair
that
be
just
turn
grey
,
brush
across
each
temple
,
so
that
the
two
side
interlace
on
his
forehead
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
circumstance
about
him
which
impress
me
most
,
be
,
that
he
have
no
voice
,
but
speak
in
a
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
the
exertion
this
cost
him
,
or
the
consciousness
of
talk
in
that
feeble
way
,
make
his
angry
face
so
much
more
angry
,
and
his
thick
vein
so
much
thick
,
when
he
speak
,
that
I
be
not
surprised
,
on
look
back
,
at
this
peculiarity
strike
me
as
his
chief
one
.
"
<EOS>
now
,
"
say
Mr
Creakle
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
report
of
this
boy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
against
him
yet
,
"
return
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
have
be
no
opportunity
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
think
Mr
Creakle
be
disappointed

<EOS>
I
think
Mrs
and
Miss
Creakle

at
whom
I
now
glance
for
the
first
time
,
and
who
be
,
both
,
thin
and
quiet
)
be
not
disappointed
.
   
<EOS>
"

Mr

the
man
with
the
wooden

the
gesture

"
You

<EOS>
hey

"
repeat
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
.
 
<EOS>
I
afterwards
find
that
he
generally
act
,
with
his
strong
voice
,
as
Mr
Creakle
's
interpreter
to
the
boy
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
frightened
,
and
say
,
I
hope
so
,
if
he
please
.
<EOS>
I
feel
,
all
this
while
,
as
if
my
ear
be
blaze

he
pinch
it
so
hard
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will

whisper
Mr
Creakle

let
it
go
at
last

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
very
glad
to
be
order
away
,
for
Mrs
and
Miss
Creakle
<EOS>
be
both
wipe
their
eye
,
and
I
feel
as
uncomfortable
for
them
as
I
do
for
myself
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
a
petition
on
my
mind
which
concern
me
so
nearly
,
that
I
could
not
help
say
,
though
I
wonder
at
my
own
courage
:
   
<EOS>
"
if
you
please
,
sir
---
"
   
Mr
Creakle
whisper
,
"
hah
!
 
<EOS>
what
be
this
?
"
and
bend
his
eye
upon
me
,
as
if
he
would
have
burn
me
up
with
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
you
please
,
sir
,
"
I
falter
,
"
if
I
may
be
allow
(
I
be
very
sorry
indeed
,
sir
,
for
what
I
do
)
to
take
this
writing
off
,
before
the
boy
come
back
---
"
   
whether
Mr
Creakle
be
in
earnest
,
or
whether
he
only
do
it
to
frighten
me
,
I
do
not
know
,
but
he
make
a
burst
out
of
his
chair
,
before
which
I
precipitately
retreat
,
without
wait
for
the
escort
of
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
,
and
never
once
stop
until
I
reach
my
own
bedroom
,
where
,
find
I
be
not
pursue
,
I
go
to
bed
,
as
it
be
time
,
and
lie
quake
,
for
a
couple
of
hour
.
   
<EOS>
next
morning
Mr
Sharp
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sharp
be
the
first
master
,
and
superior
to
Mr
Mell
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Mell
take
his
meal
with
the
boy
,
but
Mr
Sharp
dine
and
sup
at
Mr
Creakle
's
table
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
limp
,
delicate
-
look
gentleman
,
I
think
,
with
a
good
deal
of
nose
,
and
a
way
of
carry
his
head
on
one
side
,
as
if
it
be
a
little
too
heavy
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
hair
be
very
smooth
and
wavy
;
but
I
be
inform
by
the
very
first
boy
who
come
back
that
it
be
a
wig
(
a
second
-
hand
one
he
say
)
,
and
that
Mr
Sharp
go
out
every
Saturday
afternoon
to
get
it
curl
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
no
other
than
Tommy
Traddles
who
give
me
this
piece
of
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
the
first
boy
who
return
.
 
<EOS>
He
introduce
himself
by
inform
me
that
I
should
find
his
name
on
the
right
-
hand
corner
of
the
gate
,
over
the
top
-
bolt
;
upon
that
I
say
,
"
traddle
?
"
<EOS>
to
which
he
reply
,
"
the
same
,
"
and
then
he
ask
me
for
a
full
account
of
myself
and
family
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
happy
circumstance
for
me
that
Traddles
come
back
first
.
<EOS>
He
enjoy
my
placard
so
much
,
that
he
save
me
from
the
embarrassment
of
either
disclosure
or
concealment
,
by
present
me
to
every
other
boy
who
come
back
,
great
or
small
,
immediately
on
his
arrival
,
in
this
form
of
introduction
,
"
look
here
!
 
<EOS>
here
be
a
game
!
"
 
<EOS>
happily
,
too
,
the
great
part
of
the
boy
come
back
low
-
spirited
,
and
be
not
so
boisterous
at
my
expense
as
I
have
expect
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
them
certainly
do
dance
about
me
like
wild
Indians
,
and
the
great
part
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
pretend
that
I
be
a
dog
,
and
pat
and
soothe
me
,
lest
I
should
bite
,
and
say
,
"
lie
down
,
sir
!
"
and
call
me
Towzer
.
<EOS>
this
be
naturally
confusing
,
among
so
many
stranger
,
and
cost
me
some
tear
,
but
on
the
whole
it
be
much
well
than
I
have
anticipate
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
not
consider
as
be
formally
receive
into
the
school
,
however
,
until
J
Steerforth
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
before
this
boy
,
who
be
repute
to
be
a
great
scholar
,
and
be
very
good
-
look
,
and
at
least
half
-
a
-
dozen
year
my
senior
,
I
be
carry
as
before
a
magistrate
.
 
<EOS>
He
inquire
,
under
a
shed
in
the
playground
,
into
the
particular
of
my
punishment
,
and
be
pleased
to
express
his
opinion
that
it
be
"
a
jolly
shame
"
;
for
which
I
become
bind
to
him
ever
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
money
have
you
get
,
Copperfield
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
walk
aside
with
me
when
he
have
dispose
of
my
affair
in
these
term
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
seven
shilling
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
give
it
to
me
to
take
care
of
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
at
least
,
you
can
if
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
You
need
not
if
you
do
not
like
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
hasten
to
comply
with
his
friendly
suggestion
,
and
open
Peggotty
's
purse
,
turn
it
upside
down
into
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
want
to
spend
anything
now
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
no
thank
you
,
"
I
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
,
if
you
like
,
you
know
,
"
say
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
say
the
word
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
thank
you
,
sir
,
"
I
repeat
.
   
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
would
like
to
spend
a
couple
of
shilling
or
so
,
in
a
bottle
of
currant
wine
by
and
by
,
up
in
the
bedroom
?
"
say
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
belong
to
my
bedroom
,
I
find
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
certainly
have
not
occur
to
me
before
,
but
I
say
,
yes
,
I
should
like
that
.
   
<EOS>
"
very
good
,
"
say
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
glad
to
spend
another
shilling
or
so
,
in
almond
cake
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
say
,
yes
,
I
should
like
that
,
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
another
shilling
or
so
in
biscuit
,
and
another
in
fruit
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
say
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
young
Copperfield
,
you
be
go
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
smile
because
he
smile
,
but
I
be
a
little
troubled
in
my
mind
,
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
!
"
say
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
make
it
stretch
as
far
as
we
can
;
that
be
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
do
the
good
in
my
power
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
go
out
when
I
like
,
and
I
will
smuggle
the
prog
in
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
with
these
word
he
put
the
money
in
his
pocket
,
and
kindly
tell
me
not
to
make
myself
uneasy
;
he
would
take
care
<EOS>
it
should
be
all
right
.
<EOS>
He
be
as
good
as
his
word
,
if
that
be
all
right
which
I
have
a
secret
misgiving
be
nearly
all
wrong
---
for
I
fear
it
be
a
waste
of
my
mother
's
two
half
-
crown
---
though
I
have
preserve
the
piece
of
paper
they
be
wrap
in
:
which
be
a
precious
saving
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
go
upstairs
to
bed
,
he
produce
the
whole
seven
shillings'worth
,
and
lay
it
out
on
my
bed
in
the
moonlight
,
say
:
   
"
there
you
be
,
young
Copperfield
,
and
a
royal
spread
you
have
get
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
think
of
do
the
honour
of
the
feast
,
at
my
time
of
life
,
while
he
be
by
;
my
hand
shake
at
the
very
thought
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
him
to
do
me
the
favour
of
preside
;
and
my
request
being
second
by
the
other
boy
who
be
in
that
room
,
he
accede
to
it
,
and
sit
upon
my
pillow
,
handing
round
the
viand
---
with
perfect
fairness
,
I
must
say
---
and
dispense
the
currant
wine
in
a
little
glass
without
a
foot
,
which
be
his
own
property
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
me
,
I
sit
on
his
left
hand
,
and
the
rest
be
group
about
us
,
on
the
near
bed
and
on
the
floor
.
   
<EOS>
how
well
I
recollect
our
sit
there
,
talk
in
whisper
;
or
their
talking
,
and
my
respectfully
listen
<EOS>
,
I
ought
rather
to
say
;
the
moonlight
fall
a
little
way
into
the
room
,
through
the
window
,
paint
a
pale
window
on
the
floor
,
and
the
great
part
of
us
in
shadow
,
except
when
Steerforth
dip
a
match
into
a
phosphorus
-
box
,
when
he
want
to
look
for
anything
on
the
board
,
and
shed
a
blue
glare
over
us
that
be
go
directly
!
 
<EOS>
a
certain
mysterious
feeling
,
consequent
on
the
darkness
,
the
secrecy
of
the
revel
,
and
the
whisper
in
which
everything
be
say
,
steal
over
me
again
,
and
I
listen
to
all
they
tell
me
with
a
vague
feeling
of
solemnity
and
awe
,
which
make
me
glad
that
they
be
all
so
near
,
and
frighten
me
(
though
I
feign
to
laugh
)
<EOS>
when
Traddles
pretend
to
see
a
ghost
in
the
corner
.
   
<EOS>
I
hear
all
kind
of
thing
about
the
school
and
all
belong
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
that
Mr
Creakle
have
not
prefer
his
claim
to
be
a
Tartar
without
reason
;
that
he
be
the
stern
and
most
severe
of
master
;
that
he
lay
about
him
,
right
and
leave
,
every
day
of
his
life
,
charge
in
among
the
boy
like
a
trooper
,
and
slash
away
,
unmercifully
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
know
nothing
himself
,
but
the
art
of
slash
,
be
more
ignorant
(
J
Steerforth
say
)
than
the
low
boy
in
the
school
;
that
he
have
be
,
a
good
many
year
ago
,
a
small
hop
-
dealer
in
the
Borough
,
and
have
take
to
the
schooling
business
after
be
bankrupt
in
hop
,
and
make
away
with
Mrs
Creakle
's
money
.
 
<EOS>
with
a
good
deal
more
of
that
sort
,
which
I
wonder
how
they
know
.
   
<EOS>
I
hear
that
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
,
whose
name
be
Tungay
,
be
an
obstinate
barbarian
who
have
formerly
assist
in
the
hop
business
,
but
have
come
into
the
scholastic
line
with
Mr
Creakle
,
in
consequence
,
as
be
suppose
among
the
boy
,
of
his
have
break
his
leg
in
Mr
Creakle
's
service
,
and
have
do
a
deal
of
dishonest
work
for
him
,
and
know
his
secret
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
that
with
the
single
exception
of
Mr
Creakle
,
Tungay
consider
the
whole
establishment
,
master
and
boy
,
as
his
natural
enemy
,
and
that
the
only
delight
of
his
life
be
to
be
sour
and
malicious
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
that
Mr
Creakle
have
a
son
,
who
have
not
be
Tungay
's
friend
,
and
who
,
assist
in
the
school
,
have
once
hold
some
remonstrance
with
his
father
on
an
occasion
when
its
discipline
be
very
cruelly
exercise
,
and
be
suppose
,
besides
,
to
have
protest
against
his
father
's
usage
of
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
that
Mr
Creakle
have
turn
him
out
of
door
,
in
consequence
;
and
that
Mrs
and
Miss
Creakle
have
be
in
a
sad
way
,
ever
since
.
   
<EOS>
but
the
great
wonder
that
I
hear
of
Mr
Creakle
be
,
there
be
one
boy
in
the
school
on
whom
he
never
venture
to
lay
a
hand
,
and
that
boy
be
J
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
Steerforth
himself
confirm
this
when
it
be
state
,
and
say
that
he
should
like
to
begin
to
see
him
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
on
be
ask
by
a
mild
boy
(
not
me
)
how
he
would
proceed
if
he
do
begin
to
see
him
do
it
,
he
dip
a
match
into
his
phosphorus
-
box
on
purpose
to
shed
a
glare
over
his
reply
,
and
say
he
would
commence
by
knock
him
down
with
a
blow
on
the
forehead
from
the
seven
-
and
-
sixpenny
ink
-
bottle
that
be
always
on
the
mantelpiece
.
 
<EOS>
We
sit
in
the
dark
for
some
time
,
breathless
.
   
<EOS>
I
hear
that
Mr
Sharp
and
Mr
Mell
be
both
suppose
to
be
wretchedly
pay
;
and
that
when
there
be
hot
and
cold
meat
for
dinner
at
Mr
Creakle
's
table
,
Mr
Sharp
be
always
expect
to
say
he
prefer
cold
;
which
be
again
corroborate
by
J
Steerforth
,
the
only
parlour
-
boarder
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
that
Mr
Sharp
's
wig
do
not
fit
him
;
and
that
he
nee
not
be
so
"
bounceable
"
---
somebody
else
say
"
bumptious
"
---
about
it
,
because
his
own
red
hair
be
very
plainly
to
be
see
behind
.
   
<EOS>
I
hear
that
one
boy
,
who
be
a
coal
-
merchant
's
son
,
come
as
a
set
-
off
against
the
coal
-
bill
,
and
be
call
,
on
that
account
,
"
Exchange
or
Barter
"
---
a
name
select
from
the
arithmetic
book
as
express
this
arrangement
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
that
the
table
beer
be
a
robbery
of
parent
,
and
the
pudde
an
imposition
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
that
Miss
Creakle
be
regard
by
the
school
in
general
as
be
in
love
with
steerforth
;
and
I
be
sure
,
as
I
sit
in
the
dark
,
think
of
his
nice
voice
,
and
his
fine
face
,
and
his
easy
manner
,
and
his
curl
hair
,
I
think
it
very
likely
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
that
Mr
Mell
be
not
a
bad
sort
of
fellow
,
but
have
not
a
sixpence
to
bless
himself
with
;
and
that
there
be
no
doubt
that
old
Mrs
Mell
,
his
mother
,
be
as
poor
as
job
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
of
my
breakfast
then
,
and
what
have
sound
like
"
My
Charley
!
"
<EOS>
but
I
be
,
I
be
glad
to
remember
,
as
mute
as
a
mouse
about
it
.
   
<EOS>
the
hearing
of
all
this
,
and
a
good
deal
more
,
outlast
the
banquet
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
part
of
the
guest
have
go
to
bed
as
soon
as
the
eating
and
drinking
be
over
;
and
we
,
who
have
remain
whisper
and
listen
half
-
undressed
,
at
last
betook
ourselves
to
bed
,
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
good

Steerforth

<EOS>
"
I
will
take
care

<EOS>
"
You

You

say
Steerforth
,
yawning

<EOS>
"
no

"
I
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
pity

say
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
you

I

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
good
night

sir

I
reply
.
   
<EOS>
I
think
of
him
very
much
after
I
go
to
bed
,
and
raise
myself
,
I
recollect
,
to
look
at
him
where
he
lie
in
the
moonlight
,
with
his
handsome
face
turn
up
,
and
his
head
recline
easily
on
his
arm

<EOS>
He
be
a
person
of
great
power
in
my
eye
;
that
be
,
of
course
,
the
reason
of
my
mind
run
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
no
veiled
future
dimly
glance
upon
him
in
the
moonbeam
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
shadowy
picture
of
his
footstep
,
in
the
garden
that
I
dream
of
walk
in
all
night

Chapter

.
<EOS>
My
"
First
half
"
at
Salem
House
 
School
begin
in
earnest
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
a
profound
impression
be
make
upon
me
,
I
remember
,
by
the
roar
of
voice
in
the
schoolroom
suddenly
become
hush
as
death
when
Mr
Creakle
enter
after
breakfast
,
and
stand
in
the
doorway
look
round
upon
us
like
a
giant
in
a
story
-
book
survey
his
captive
.
   
<EOS>
Tungay
stand
at
Mr
Creakle
's
elbow
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
occasion
,
I
think
,
to
cry
out
"
Silence
!
"
<EOS>
so
ferociously
,
for
the
boy
be
all
strike
speechless
and
motionless
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Creakle
be
see
to
speak
,
and
Tungay
be
hear
,
to
this
effect
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
boy
,
this
be
a
new
half
.
 
<EOS>
take
care
what
you
be
about
,
in
this
new
half
.
 
<EOS>
come
fresh
up
to
the
lesson
,
I
advise
you
,
for
I
come
fresh
up
to
the
punishment
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
flinch
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
of
no
use
your
rubbing
yourself
;
you
will
not
rub
the
mark
out
that
I
shall
give
you
.
 
<EOS>
now
get
to
work
,
every
boy
!
"
   
<EOS>
when
this
dreadful
exordium
be
over
,
and
Tungay
have
stump
out
again
,
Mr
Creakle
come
to
where
I
sit
,
and
tell
me
that
if
I
be
famous
for
biting
,
he
be
famous
for
bite
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
show
me
the
cane
,
and
ask
me
what
I
think
of
that
,
for
a
tooth
?
 
<EOS>
be
it
a
sharp
tooth
,
<EOS>
hey
?
 
<EOS>
be
it
a
double
tooth
,
<EOS>
hey
?
 
<EOS>
have
it
a
deep
prong
,
<EOS>
hey
?
 
<EOS>
do
it
bite
,
hey
?
 
<EOS>
do
it
bite
?
 
<EOS>
at
every
question
he
give
me
a
fleshy
cut
with
it
that
make
me
writhe
;
so
I
be
very
soon
make
free
of
Salem
House
(
as
Steerforth
say
)
,
and
be
very
soon
in
tear
also
.
   
<EOS>
not
that
I
mean
to
say
these
be
special
mark
of
distinction
,
which
only
I
receive
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
a
large
majority
of
the
boy
(
especially
the
small
one
)
be
visit
with
similar
instance
of
notice
,
as
Mr
Creakle
make
the
round
of
the
schoolroom
.
 
<EOS>
half
the
establishment
be
writhe
and
cry
,
before
the
day
's
work
begin
;
and
how
much
of
it
have
writhe
and
cry
before
the
day
's
work
be
over
,
I
be
really
afraid
to
recollect
,
lest
I
should
seem
to
exaggerate
.
   
<EOS>
I
should
think
there
never
can
have
be
a
man
who
enjoy
his
profession
more
than
Mr
Creakle
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
delight
in
cut
at
the
boy
,
which
be
like
the
satisfaction
of
a
craving
appetite
.
<EOS>
I
be
confident
that
he
could
not
resist
a
chubby
boy
,
especially
;
that
there
be
a
fascination
in
such
a
subject
,
which
make
him
restless
in
his
mind
,
until
he
have
score
and
mark
him
for
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
chubby
myself
,
and
ought
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
<EOS>
when
I
think
of
the
fellow
now
,
my
blood
rise
against
him
with
the
disinterested
indignation
I
should
feel
if
I
could
have
know
all
about
him
without
have
ever
be
in
his
power
;
but
it
rise
hotly
,
because
I
know
him
to
have
be
an
incapable
brute
,
who
have
no
more
right
to
be
possess
of
the
great
trust
he
hold
,
than
to
be
Lord
High
Admiral
,
or
Commander
-
in
-
chief
---
in
either
of
which
capacitie
it
be
probable
that
he
would
have
do
infinitely
less
mischief
.
   
<EOS>
miserable
little
propitiator
of
a
remorseless
idol
<EOS>
,
how
abject
we
be
to
him
!
 
<EOS>
what
a
launch
in
life
<EOS>
I
think
it
now
,
on
look
back
,
to
be
so
mean
and
servile
to
a
man
of
such
part
and
pretension
!
   
<EOS>
here
I
sit
at
the
desk
again
,
watch
his
eye
---
humbly
watch
his
eye
,
as
he
rule
a
cipher
-
book
for
another
victim
whose
hand
have
just
be
flatten
by
that
identical
ruler
,
and
who
be
try
to
wipe
the
ste
out
with
a
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
plenty
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
watch
his
eye
in
idleness
,
but
because
I
be
morbidly
attract
to
it
,
in
a
dread
desire
to
know
what
he
will
do
next
,
and
whether
it
will
be
my
turn
to
suffer
,
or
somebody
else
's
.
<EOS>
a
lane
of
small
boy
beyond
me
,
with
the
same
interest
in
his
eye
,
watch
it
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
he
know
it
,
though
he
pretend
he
do
not
.
<EOS>
He
make
dreadful
mouth
as
he
rule
the
cipher
-
book
;
and
now
he
throw
his
eye
sideway
down
our
lane
,
and
we
all
droop
over
our
book
and
tremble
.
 
<EOS>
a
moment
afterwards
we
be
again
eye
him
.
<EOS>
an
unhappy
culprit
,
find
guilty
of
imperfect
exercise
,
approach
at
his
command
.
 
<EOS>
the
culprit
falter
excuse
,
and
profess
a
determination
to
do
well
tomorrow
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Creakle
cut
a
joke
before
he
beat
him
,
and
we
laugh
at
it
,
---
<EOS>
miserable
little
dog
,
we
laugh
,
with
our
visage
as
white
as
ashe
,
and
our
heart
sink
into
our
boot
.
   
<EOS>
here
I
sit
at
the
desk
again
,
on
a
drowsy
summer
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
a
buzz
and
hum
go
up
around
me
,
as
if
the
boy
be
so
many
bluebottle
.
<EOS>
a
cloggy
sensation
of
the
lukewarm
fat
of
meat
be
upon
me
(
we
dine
an
hour
or
two
ago
)
,
and
my
head
be
as
heavy
as
so
much
lead
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
give
the
world
to
go
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
with
my
eye
on
Mr
Creakle
,
blink
at
him
like
a
young
owl
<EOS>
;
when
sleep
overpower
me
for
a
minute
,
he
still
loom
through
my
slumber
,
rule
those
cipher
-
book
,
until
he
softly
come
behind
me
and
wake
me
to
plainer
perception
of
him
,
with
a
red
ridge
across
my
back
.
   
<EOS>
here
I
be
in
the
playground
,
with
my
eye
still
fascinate
by
him
,
though
I
can
not
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
window
at
a
little
distance
from
which
I
know
he
be
have
his
dinner
,
stand
for
him
,
and
I
eye
that
instead
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
show
his
face
near
it
,
mine
assume
an
imploring
and
submissive
expression
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
look
out
through
the
glass
,
the
bold
boy
(
Steerforth
excepted
)
stop
in
the
middle
of
a
shout
or
yell
,
and
become
contemplative
.
 
<EOS>
one
day
,
Traddles
(
the
most
unfortunate
boy
in
the
world
)
break
that
window
accidentally
,
with
a
ball
.
 
<EOS>
I
shudder
at
this
moment
with
the
tremendous
sensation
of
see
it
do
,
and
feel
that
the
ball
have
bound
on
to
Mr
Creakle
's
sacred
head
.
   
<EOS>
poor
Traddles
!
 
<EOS>
in
a
tight
sky
-
blue
suit
that
make
his
arm
and
leg
like
german
sausage
,
or
roly
-
poly
pudding
,
he
be
the
merry
and
most
miserable
of
all
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
always
be
cane
<EOS>
---
I
think
he
be
cane
every
day
that
half
-
year
,
except
one
holiday
Monday
when
he
be
only
ruler'd
on
both
hand
---
and
be
always
go
to
write
to
his
uncle
about
it
,
and
never
do
.
 
<EOS>
after
lay
his
head
on
the
desk
for
a
little
while
,
he
would
cheer
up
,
somehow
,
begin
to
laugh
again
,
and
draw
skeleton
all
over
his
slate
,
before
his
eye
be
dry
.
 
<EOS>
I
use
at
first
to
wonder
what
comfort
Traddles
find
in
draw
skeleton
;
and
for
some
time
look
upon
him
as
a
sort
of
hermit
,
who
remind
himself
by
those
symbol
of
mortality
that
caning
could
not
last
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
believe
he
only
do
it
because
they
be
easy
,
and
do
not
want
any
feature
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
very
honourable
,
Traddles
be
,
and
hold
it
as
a
solemn
duty
in
the
boy
to
stand
by
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
He
suffer
for
this
on
several
occasion
;
and
particularly
once
,
when
Steerforth
laugh
in
church
,
and
the
Beadle
think
it
be
Traddles
,
and
take
him
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
now
,
go
away
in
custody
,
despise
by
the
congregation
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
say
who
be
the
real
offender
,
though
he
smart
for
it
next
day
,
and
be
imprison
so
many
hour
that
he
come
forth
with
a
whole
churchyard
-
full
of
skeleton
swarm
all
over
his
Latin
Dictionary
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
his
reward
.
 
<EOS>
Steerforth
say
there
be
nothing
of
the
sneak
in
Traddles
,
and
we
all
feel
that
to
be
the
high
praise
.
 
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
could
have
go
through
a
good
deal
(
though
I
be
much
less
brave
than
Traddles
,
and
nothing
like
so
old
)
to
have
win
such
a
recompense
.
   
<EOS>
to
see
Steerforth
walk
to
church
before
us
,
arm
-
in
-
arm
with
Miss
Creakle
,
be
one
of
the
great
sight
of
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
Miss
Creakle
equal
to
little
em'ly
in
point
of
beauty
,
and
I
do
not
love
her
<EOS>
(
I
do
not
dare
)
;
but
I
think
her
a
young
lady
of
extraordinary
attraction
,
and
in
point
of
gentility
not
to
be
surpass
.
 
<EOS>
when
Steerforth
,
in
white
trouser
,
carry
her
parasol
for
her
,
I
feel
proud
to
know
him
;
and
believe
that
she
could
not
choose
but
adore
him
with
all
her
heart

<EOS>
Mr
Sharp
and
Mr
Mell
be
both
notable
personage
in
my
eye
;
but
Steerforth
be
to
them
what
the
sun
be
to
two
star
.
   
<EOS>
Steerforth
continue
his
protection
of
me
,
and
prove
a
very
useful
friend
;
since
nobody
dare
to
annoy
one
whom
he
honour
with
his
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
---
or
at
all
event
he
do
not
---
defend
me
from
Mr
Creakle
,
who
be
very
severe
with
me
;
but
whenever
I
have
be
treat
bad
than
usual
,
he
always
tell
me
that
I
want
a
little
of
his
pluck
,
and
that
he
would
not
have
stand
it
himself
;
which
I
feel
he
intend
for
encouragement
,
and
consider
to
be
very
kind
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
one
advantage
,
and
only
one
that
I
know
of
,
in
Mr
Creakle
's
severity
.
 
<EOS>
He
find
my
placard
in
his
way
when
he
come
up
or
down
behind
the
form
on
which
I
sit
,
and
want
to
make
a
cut
at
me
in
pass
;
for
this
reason
it
be
soon
take
off
,
and
I
see
it
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
an
accidental
circumstance
cement
the
intimacy
between
Steerforth
and
me
,
in
a
manner
that
inspire
me
with
great
pride
and
satisfaction
,
though
it
sometimes
lead
to
inconvenience
.
 
<EOS>
It
happen
on
one
occasion
,
when
he
be
do
me
the
honour
of
talk
to
me
in
the
playground
,
that
I
hazard
the
observation
that
something
or
somebody
---
I
forget
what
now
---
be
like
something
or
somebody
in
Peregrine
Pickle
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
nothing
at
the
time
;
but
when
I
be
go
to
bed
at
night
,
ask
me
if
I
have
get
that
book
?
   
<EOS>
I
tell
him
no
,
and
explain
how
it
be
that
I
have
read
it
,
and
all
those
other
book
of
which
I
have
make
mention
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
do
you
recollect
them
?
"
<EOS>
Steerforth
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
yes
,
"
I
reply
;
I
have
a
good
memory
,
and
I
believe
I
recollect
them
very
well
.
   
<EOS>
"
then
I
tell
you
what
,
young
Copperfield
,
"
say
Steerforth
,
"
you
shall
tell
'em
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
get
to
sleep
very
early
at
night
,
and
I
generally
wake
rather
early
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
go
over
'em
one
after
another
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
make
some
regular
Arabian
Nights
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
feel
extremely
flatter
by
this
arrangement
,
and
we
commence
carry
it
into
execution
that
very
evening
.
 
<EOS>
what
ravage
I
commit
on
my
favourite
author
in
the
course
of
my
interpretation
of
them
,
I
be
not
in
a
condition
to
say
,
and
should
be
very
unwilling
to
know
;
but
I
have
a
profound
faith
in
them
,
and
I
have
,
to
the
good
of
my
belief
,
a
simple
,
earnest
manner
of
narrate
what
I
do
narrate
;
and
these
quality
go
a
long
way
.
   
<EOS>
the
drawback
be
,
that
I
be
often
sleepy
at
night
,
or
out
of
spirit
and
indispose
to
resume
the
story
;
and
then
it
be
rather
hard
work
,
and
it
must
be
do
;
for
to
disappoint
or
to
displease
Steerforth
be
of
course
out
of
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
morning
,
too
,
when
I
feel
weary
,
and
should
have
enjoy
another
hour
's
repose
very
much
,
it
be
a
tiresome
thing
to
be
rouse
,
like
the
Sultana
Scheherazade
,
and
force
into
a
long
story
before
the
get
-
up
bell
rang
;
but
Steerforth
be
resolute
;
and
as
he
explain
to
me
,
in
return
,
my
sum
and
exercise
,
and
anything
in
my
task
that
be
too
hard
for
me
,
I
be
no
loser
by
the
transaction
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
do
myself
justice
,
however
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
move
by
no
interested
or
selfish
motive
,
nor
be
I
move
by
fear
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
admire
and
love
him
,
and
his
approval
be
return
enough
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
precious
to
me
that
I
look
back
on
these
trifle
,
now
,
with
an
ache
heart
.
   
<EOS>
steerforth
be
considerate
,
too
;
and
show
his
consideration
,
in
one
particular
instance
,
in
an
unflinching
manner
that
be
a
little
tantalizing
,
I
suspect
,
to
poor
traddle
and
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
's
promised
letter
---
what
a
comfortable
letter
it
be
!
<EOS>
---
arrive
before
"
the
half
"
be
many
week
old
;
and
with
it
a
cake
in
a
perfect
nest
of
orange
,
and
two
bottle
of
cowslip
wine
.
 
<EOS>
this
treasure
,
as
in
duty
bind
,
I
lay
at
the
foot
of
Steerforth
,
and
beg
him
to
dispense
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
I
will
tell
you
what
,
young
Copperfield
,
"
say
he
:
"
the
wine
shall
be
keep
to
wet
your
whistle
when
you
be
story
-
telling
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
blush
at
the
idea
,
and
beg
him
,
in
my
modesty
,
not
to
think
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
say
he
have
observe
I
be
sometimes
hoarse
---
a
little
roopy
be
his
exact
expression
---
and
it
should
be
,
every
drop
,
devote
to
the
purpose
he
have
mention
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
it
be
lock
up
in
his
box
,
and
draw
off
by
himself
in
a
phial
,
and
administer
to
me
through
a
piece
of
quill
in
the
cork
,
when
I
be
suppose
to
be
in
want
of
a
restorative
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
to
make
it
a
more
sovereign
specific
,
he
be
so
kind
as
to
squeeze
orange
juice
into
it
,
or
to
stir
it
up
with
ginger
,
or
dissolve
a
peppermint
drop
in
it
;
and
although
I
can
not
assert
that
the
flavour
be
improve
by
these
experiment
,
or
that
it
be
exactly
the
compound
one
would
have
choose
for
a
stomachic
,
the
last
thing
at
night
and
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
,
I
drink
it
gratefully
and
be
very
sensible
of
his
attention
.
   
<EOS>
We
seem
,
to
me
,
to
have
be
month
over
Peregrine
,
and
month
more
over
the
other
story
.
 
<EOS>
the
institution
never
flag
for
want
of
a
story
,
I
be
certain
;
and
the
wine
last
out
almost
as
well
as
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Traddles
---
I
never
think
of
that
boy
but
with
a
strange
disposition
to
laugh
,
and
with
tear
in
my
eye
---
be
a
sort
of
chorus
,
in
general
;
and
affect
to
be
convulse
with
mirth
at
the
comic
part
,
and
to
be
overcome
with
fear
when
there
be
any
passage
of
an
alarming
character
in
the
narrative
.
 
<EOS>
this
rather
put
me
out
,
very
often
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
jest
of
his
,
I
recollect
,
to
pretend
that
he
could
not
keep
his
tooth
from
chatter
,
whenever
mention
be
make
of
an
Alguazill
in
connexion
with
the
adventure
of
Gil
Blas
;
and
I
remember
that
when
Gil
Blas
meet
the
captain
of
the
robber
in
Madrid
,
this
unlucky
joker
counterfeit
such
an
ague
of
terror
,
that
he
be
overhear
by
Mr
Creakle
,
who
be
prowl
about
the
passage
,
and
handsomely
flog
for
disorderly
conduct
in
the
bedroom
.
<EOS>
whatever
I
have
within
me
that
be
romantic
and
dreamy
,
be
encourage
by
so
much
story
-
telling
in
the
dark
;
and
in
that
respect
the
pursuit
may
not
have
be
very
profitable
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
being
cherish
as
a
kind
of
playthe
in
my
room
,
and
the
consciousness
that
this
accomplishment
of
mine
be
bruit
about
among
the
boy
,
and
attract
a
good
deal
of
notice
to
me
though
I
be
the
young
there
,
stimulate
me
to
exertion
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
school
carry
on
by
sheer
cruelty
,
whether
it
be
preside
over
by
a
dunce
or
not
,
there
be
not
likely
to
be
much
learn
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
our
boy
be
,
generally
,
as
ignorant
a
set
as
any
schoolboy
in
existence
;
they
be
too
much
troubled
and
knock
about
to
learn
;
they
could
no
more
do
that
to
advantage
,
than
any
one
can
do
anything
to
advantage
in
a
life
of
constant
misfortune
,
torment
,
and
worry
.
<EOS>
but
my
little
vanity
,
and
Steerforth
's
help
,
urge
me
on
somehow
;
and
without
save
me
from
much
,
if
anything
,
in
the
way
of
punishment
,
make
me
,
for
the
time
I
be
there
,
an
exception
to
the
general
body
,
insomuch
that
I
do
steadily
pick
up
some
crumb
of
knowledge
.
   
<EOS>
in
this
I
be
much
assist
by
Mr
Mell
,
who
have
a
liking
for
me
that
I
be
grateful
to
remember
.
 
<EOS>
It
always
give
me
pain
to
observe
that
Steerforth
treat
him
with
systematic
disparagement
,
and
seldom
lose
an
occasion
of
wound
his
feeling
,
or
induce
other
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
this
trouble
me
the
more
for
a
long
time
,
because
I
have
soon
tell
Steerforth
,
from
whom
I
could
no
more
keep
such
a
secret
,
than
I
could
keep
a
cake
or
any
other
tangible
possession
,
about
the
two
old
woman
Mr
Mell
<EOS>
have
take
me
to
see
;
and
I
be
always
afraid
that
Steerforth
would
let
it
out
,
and
twit
him
with
it
.
   
<EOS>
We
little
thought
<EOS>
,
any
one
of
us
,
I
dare
say
,
when
I
eat
my
breakfast
that
first
morning
,
and
go
to
sleep
under
the
shadow
of
the
peacock
's
feather
to
the
sound
of
the
flute
,
what
consequence
would
come
of
the
introduction
into
those
alm
-
house
of
my
insignificant
person
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
visit
have
its
unforeseen
consequence
;
and
of
a
serious
sort
,
too
,
in
their
way
.
   
<EOS>
one
day
when
Mr
Creakle
keep
the
house
from
indisposition
,
which
naturally
diffuse
a
lively
joy
through
the
school
,
there
be
a
good
deal
of
noise
in
the
course
of
the
morning
's
work
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
relief
and
satisfaction
experience
by
the
boy
make
them
difficult
to
manage
;
and
though
the
dread
Tungay
bring
his
wooden
leg
in
twice
or
thrice
,
and
take
note
of
the
principal
offender
'
name
,
no
great
impression
be
make
by
it
,
as
they
be
pretty
sure
of
get
into
trouble
tomorrow
,
do
what
they
would
,
and
think
it
wise
,
no
doubt
,
to
enjoy
themselves
today
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
,
properly
,
a
half
-
holiday
;
be
Saturday
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
the
noise
in
the
playground
would
have
disturb
Mr
Creakle
,
and
the
weather
be
not
favourable
for
go
out
walk
,
we
be
order
into
school
in
the
afternoon
,
and
set
some
light
task
than
usual
,
which
be
make
for
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
day
of
the
week
on
which
Mr
Sharp
go
out
to
get
his
wig
curl
;
so
Mr
Mell
,
who
always
do
the
drudgery
,
whatever
it
be
,
keep
school
by
himself
.
<EOS>
if
I
could
associate
the
idea
of
a
bull
or
a
bear
with
anyone
so
mild
as
Mr
Mell
,
I
should
think
of
him
,
in
connexion
with
that
afternoon
when
the
uproar
be
at
its
height
,
as
of
one
of
those
animal
,
bait
by
a
thousand
dog
.
 
<EOS>
I
recall
him
bend
his
ache
head
,
support
on
his
bony
hand
,
over
the
book
on
his
desk
,
and
wretchedly
endeavour
to
get
on
with
his
tiresome
work
,
amidst
an
uproar
that
may
have
make
the
Speaker
of
the
House
of
Commons
giddy
.
 
<EOS>
boy
start
in
and
out
of
their
place
,
play
at
puss
in
the
corner
with
other

there
be
laugh

,
singe
boy
,
talk

,
dance

howl

boy
shuffle
with
their

whirl
about
him
,

mimic
him
behind
his
back
and
before
his
eye

mimic
his
poverty
,
his
boot
,
his
coat
,
his
mother
,
everything
belong
to
him
that
they
should
have
have
consideration
for
.
   
<EOS>
"
Silence
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Mr
Mell
,
suddenly
rise
up
,
and
strike
his
desk
with
the
book
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
this
mean
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
madden

<EOS>
how
can
you
do
it
to
me
,
boy
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
my
book
that
he
strike
his
desk
with
;
and
as
I
stand
beside
him
,
follow
his
eye
as
it
glance
round
the
room
,
I
see
the
boy
all
stop
,
some
suddenly
surprised
,
some
half
afraid
,
and
some
sorry
perhaps
.
   
<EOS>
Steerforth
's
place
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
school
,
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
long
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
lounge
with
his
back
against
the
wall
,
and
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
and
look
at
Mr
Mell
with
his
mouth
shut
up
as
if
he
be
whistle
,
when
Mr
Mell
look
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Silence
,
Mr
Steerforth
!
"
say
Mr
Mell
.
   
<EOS>
"
silence
yourself
,
"
say
Steerforth
,
turn
red
.
 
<EOS>
"
whom
be
you
talk
to

"
   
<EOS>
"
sit
down

"
say
Mr

<EOS>
"
sit
down
yourself
,
"
say
Steerforth
,
"
and
mind
your
business
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
titter
,
and
some
applause
;
but
Mr
Mell
be
so
white
,
that
silence
immediately
succeed
;
and
one
boy
,
who
have
dart
out
behind
him
to
imitate
his
mother
again
,
change
his
mind
,
and
pretend
to
want
a
pen
mend

<EOS>
"

say
Mr

,
"
that
I

can
establish
over

he
lay
his
hand
,
without
consider
what
he
do
(
as
I
suppose
)
,
upon
my
head

"

do
not

myself
the
trouble

Steerforth

coolly

so
I

it
happen

pursue
Mr

more

I
tell
you

when

You

you
do
that

you

an
impudent
beggar

I
be
not
clear
whether
he
be
go
to
strike
Mr
Mell

Mr

be
go
to
strike
him
,
or
there
be
any
such
intention
on
either
side

<EOS>
I
see
a
rigidity
come
upon
the
whole
school
as
if
they
have
be
turn
into
stone
,
and
find
Mr
Creakle
in
the

of
us

with
Tungay
at
his
side

Mrs

Miss
Creakle
look
in
at
the
door

be
frightened

Mr

with
his
elbow
on

desk

his
face
in

for
some
moment

quite
still

so
audible
now
,
that
Tungay
feel
it
unnecessary
to

his

the

<EOS>
Mr

look
hard
at
Mr

put
his
hand
on
Tungay
's
shoulder

and
get
his
foot
upon
the
form
close
by
,
and
sit
upon
the
desk

<EOS>
after
still
look
hard
at
Mr

from
his
throne
,
as
he
shake
his

remain
in
the

state
of
agitation
,
Mr

turn
to
Steerforth

and
say
:
   
"
now

as

<EOS>
Steerforth
evade
the
question
for
a
little
while
;
look
in
scorn
and
anger
on
his
opponent
,
and
remain
silent
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
think
even
in
that
interval
<EOS>
,
I
remember
,
what
a
noble
fellow
he
be
in
appearance
,

<EOS>
how
homely
and
plain
Mr
Mell
look
opposed
to
him

what
do

pray
,
what

demand
Mr
Creakle
,
turn
angrily
on
his
assistant
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
Mr
Creakle
,
"
he
return
in
a
low
voice
,
"
as
I
say
;
that
no
pupil
have
a
right
to
avail
himself
of
his
position
of
favouritism
to
degrade
me

<EOS>
"
to
degrade
you

Mr

"
My
star

<EOS>
but
give
me
leave
to
ask
you
,
Mr
What's
-
your

name

;
and
here
Mr
Creakle
fold
his
arm
,
cane
and
all
,
upon
his
chest
,
and
make
such
a
knot
of
his
brow
that
his
little
eye
be
hardly
visible
below
them
;

whether
,
when
you
talk

you
show
proper
respect

<EOS>
to
me
,
sir

say
Mr
Creakle
,
dart
his
head
at
him
suddenly
,

draw
it
back
again
,
"
the
principal
of
this
establishment
,

your
employer

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
judicious
,
sir
,
I
be
willing
to
admit
,
"
say
Mr
Mell
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
have
do
so
,
if
I
have
be
cool

<EOS>
here
Steerforth
strike
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
then
he
say
I
be
mean
,
and
then
he
say
I
be
base
,
and
then
I
call
him
a
beggar
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
cool
,
perhaps
I
should
not
have
call
him
a
beggar
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
,
and
I
be
ready
to
take
the
consequence
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
without
consider
,
perhaps
,
whether
there
be
any
consequence
to
be
take
,
I
feel
quite
in
a
glow
at
this
gallant
speech
.
 
<EOS>
It
make
an
impression
on
the
boy
too
,
for
there
be
a
low
stir
among
them
,
though
no
one
speak
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
surprised
,
Steerforth

although
your
candour
do
you
honour
,
"
say
Mr
Creakle
,
"
do
you
honour
,
certainly
---
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
,
Steerforth
,
I
must
say
,
that
you
should
attach
such
an
epithet
to
any
person
employ
and
pay
in
Salem
House

sir

<EOS>
Steerforth
give
a
short
laugh

<EOS>
"
that
be
not
an
answer
,
sir

Mr
Creakle

"
to
my
remark

<EOS>
I
expect
more
than
that
from
you
,
Steerforth

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
if
Mr
Mell
look
homely
,
in
my
eye
,
before
the
handsome
boy
,
it
would
be
quite
impossible
to
say
how
homely
Mr
Creakle
look
.
<EOS>
"
let
him
deny
it
,
"
say
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
deny
that
he
be
a
beggar

Steerforth

cry
Mr
Creakle

<EOS>
"
why
,
where
do
he
go
a
-
begging

He

at

Mr

hand
gently
pat
me
upon

shoulder

<EOS>
I
look
up
with
a
flush
upon

remorse
in

heart

be
fix
on

He
continue
to
pat
me
kindly
on

he
look
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
since
you
expect

justify
myself

say
Steerforth
,
"

to
say
what
I
mean

what
I
have
to
say
be
,
that
his
mother
live
on
charity
in
an
alms

house

<EOS>
Mr

still
look
at
him
,

still
pat
me
kindly
on

shoulder

say
to
himself

in
a
whisper

if
I
hear
right
:

yes

I
think
so

Mr

turn
to
his

with
a
severe
frown

politeness

hear

have
the
goodness

him
right

He

right

return
Mr

Mr

put
his

on

side

roll
his

round

You
know

here

Mr

with
his
vein
swell
again
big
than
ever

you

be
in
a

altogether

this

glance
round
the
room

gently
on

James
Steerforth
,
the
good
wish
I
can
leave
you
be
that
you
may
come
to
be
ashamed
of
what
you
have
do
today
.
 
<EOS>
at
present
I
would
prefer
to
see
you
anything
rather
than
a
friend
,
to
me
,
or
to
anyone
in
whom
I
feel
an
interest
.
"
   
<EOS>
once
more
he
lay
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
;
and
then
take
his
flute
and
a
few
book
from
his
desk
,
and
leave
the
key
in
it
for
his
successor
,
he
go
out
of
the
school
,
with
his
property
under
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Creakle
then
make
a
speech
,
through
Tungay
,
in
which
he
thank
Steerforth
for
assert
(
though
perhaps
too
warmly
)
the
independence
and
respectability
of
Salem
House
;
and
which
he
wind
up
by
shake
hand
with
Steerforth
,
while
we
give
three
cheer
---
I
do
not
quite
know
what
for
,
but
I
suppose
for
Steerforth
,
and
so
joined
in
them
ardently
,
though
I
feel
miserable
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Creakle
then
cane
Tommy
Traddles
for
be
discover
in
tear
,
instead
of
cheer
,
on
account
of
Mr
Mell
's
departure
;
and
go
back
to
his
sofa
,
or
his
bed
,
or
wherever
he
have
come
from
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
leave
to
ourselves
now
,
and
look
very
blank
,
I
recollect
,
on
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
for
myself
,
I
feel
so
much
self
-
reproach
and
contrition
for
my
part
in
what
have
happen
,
that
nothing
would
have
enable
me
to
keep
back
my
tear
but
the
fear
that
Steerforth
,
who
often
look
at
me
,
I
see
,
may
think
it
unfriendly
---
or
<EOS>
,
I
should
rather
say
,
consider
our
relative
age
,
and
the
feeling
with
which
I
regard
him
,
<EOS>
undutiful
---
if
I
show
the
emotion
which
distress
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
angry
with
Traddles
,
and
say
he
be
glad
he
have
catch
it
.
   
<EOS>
Poor
Traddles
,
who
have
pass
the
stage
of
lie
with
his
head
upon
the
desk
,
and
be
relieve
himself
as
usual
with
a
burst
of
skeleton
,
say
he
do
not
care
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Mell
be
ill
-
use
.
   
<EOS>
"
who
have
ill
-
use
him
,
you
girl
?
"
say
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
have
,
"
return
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
have
I
do
?
"
say
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
have
you
do
?
"
<EOS>
retort
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
hurt
his
feeling
,
and
lose
him
his
situation
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
His
feeling
?
"
repeat
Steerforth
disdainfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
feeling
will
soon
get
the
well
of
it
,
I
will
be
bind
.
 
<EOS>
His
feeling
be
not
like
yours
,
Miss
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
his
situation
---
which
be
a
precious
one
,
be
not
it
?
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
do
you
suppose
I
be
not
go
to
write
home
,
and
take
care
that
he
get
some
money
?
 
<EOS>
polly
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
We
think
this
intention
very
noble
in
Steerforth
,
whose
mother
be
a
widow
,
and
rich
,
and
would
do
almost
anything
,
it
be
say
,
that
he
ask
her
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
all
extremely
glad
to
see
Traddles
so
put
down
,
and
exalt
Steerforth
to
the
sky
:
especially
when
he
tell
us
,
as
he
condescend
to
do
,
that
what
he
have
do
have
be
do
expressly
for
us
,
and
for
our
cause
;
and
that
he
have
confer
a
great
boon
upon
us
by
unselfishly
do
it
.
<EOS>
but
I
must
say
that
when
I
be
go
on
with
a
story
in
the
dark
that
night
,
Mr
Mell
's
old
flute
seem
more
than
once
to
sound
mournfully
in
my
ear
;
and
that
when
at
last
Steerforth
be
tired
,
and
I
lie
down
in
my
bed
,
I
fancy
it
play
so
sorrowfully
somewhere
,
that
I
be
quite
wretched
.
   
<EOS>
I
soon
forget
him
in
the
contemplation
of
Steerforth
,
who
,
in
an
easy
amateur
way
,
and
without
any
book
(
he
seem
to
me
to
know
everything
by
heart
)
,
take
some
of
his
class
until
a
new
master
be
find
.
 
<EOS>
the
new
master
come
from
a
grammar
school
;
and
before
he
enter
on
his
duty
,
dine
in
the
parlour
one
day
,
to
be
introduce
to
Steerforth

<EOS>
Steerforth
approve
of
him
highly
,
and
tell
us
he
be
a
Brick
.
 
<EOS>
without
exactly
understand
what
learn
distinction
be
mean
by
this
,
I
respect
him
greatly
for
it
,
and
have
no
doubt
whatever
of
his
superior
knowledge
:
though
he
never
take
the
pain
with
me
---
not
that
I
be
anybody
---
that
Mr
Mell
have
take
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
only
one
other
event
in
this
half
-
year
,
out
of
the
daily
school
-
life
,
that
make
an
impression
upon
me
which
still
survive
.
<EOS>
It
survive
for
many
reason
.
   
<EOS>
one
afternoon
,
when
we
be
all
harass
into
a
state
of
dire
confusion
,
and
Mr
Creakle
be
lay
about
him
dreadfully
,
Tungay
come
in
,
and
call
out
in
his
usual
strong
way
:
"
visitor
for
Copperfield
!
"
   
<EOS>
a
few
word
be
interchange
between
him
and
Mr
Creakle
,
as
,
who
the
visitor
be
,
and
what
room
they
be
to
be
show
into
;
and
then
I
,
who
have
,
accord
to
custom
,
stand
up
on
the
announcement
be
make
,
and
feel
quite
faint
with
astonishment
,
be
tell
to
go
by
the
back
stair
and
get
a
clean
frill
on
,
before
I
repair
to
the
dining
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
these
order
I
obey
,
in
such
a
flutter
and
hurry
of
my
young
spirit
as
I
have
never
know
before
;
and
when
I
get
to
the
parlour
door
,
and
the
thought
come
into
my
head
that
it
may
be
my
mother
<EOS>
---
I
have
only
think
of
Mr
or
Miss
Murdstone
until
then
---
I
draw
back
my
hand
from
the
lock
,
and
stop
to
have
a
sob
before
I
go
in
.
   
<EOS>
at
first
I
see
nobody
;
but
feel
a
pressure
against
the
door
,
I
look
round
it
,
and
there
,
to
my
amazement
,
be
Mr
Peggotty
and
Ham
,
duck
at
me
with
their
hat
,
and
squeeze
one
another
against
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
laugh
;
but
it
be
much
more
in
the
pleasure
of
see
them
,
than
at
the
appearance
they
make
.
<EOS>
We
shake
hand
in
a
very
cordial
way
;
and
I
laugh
and
laugh
,
until
I
pull
out
my
pocket
-
handkerchief
and
wipe
my
eye
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
(
who
never
shut
his
mouth
once
,
I
remember
,
during
the
visit
)
show
great
concern
when
he
see
me
do
this
,
and
nudge
Ham
to
say
something
.
   
<EOS>
"

say
Ham
,
in

<EOS>

<EOS>
I
be
not

at
anything
in
particular
that
I

say
Mr

.
   
<EOS>
They
make
me
laugh
again
by
laugh
at
each
other
,
and
then
we
all
three
laugh
until
I
be
in
danger
of
cry
again
.
   
<EOS>
"

sheepishly
over
the
shellfish

without
make
any

say
:

"
   
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
consider
a
little
before
I
understand
what
Mr
Peggotty
mean
by
this
figure
,
expressive
of
a
complete
circle
of
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
thank
him
heartily
;
and
say
,
with
a
consciousness
of
reddening
,
that
I
suppose
little
Em'ly
be
alter
too
,
since
we
use
to
pick
up
shell

pebble
on
the

"
She

say
Mr

.
 
<EOS>
"
ask
him
.
"
<EOS>
He
mean
Ham
,
who
beam
with
delight
and
assent
over
the
bag
of
shrimp
.
   
<EOS>
"
Her
pretty
face
!
"
say
Mr
Peggotty
,
with
his
own
shining
like
a
light

<EOS>
"
Her

and
so
large
it

you
may
see
it

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
perfectly
delightful
to
behold
with
what
enthusiasm
Mr
Peggotty
become
inspire
when
he
think
of
his
little
favourite
.
<EOS>
He
stand
before
me
again
,
his
bluff
hairy
face
irradiate
with
a
joyful
love
and
pride
,
for
which
I
can
find
no
description
.
 
<EOS>
His
honest
eye
fire
up
,
and
sparkle
,
as
if
their
depth
be
stir
by
something
bright
.
 
<EOS>
His
broad
chest
heave
with
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
His
strong
loose
hand
clench
themselves
,
in
his
earnestness
;
and
he
emphasize
what
he
say
with
a
right
arm
that
show
,
in
my
pigmy
view
,
like
a
sledge
-
hammer
.
   
<EOS>
Ham
be
quite
as
earnest
as
he
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
they
would
have
say
much
more
about
her
,
if
they
have
not
be
abash
by
the
unexpected
come
in
of
Steerforth
,
who
,
see
me
in
a
corner
speak
with
two
stranger
,
stop
in
a
song
he
be
singe
,
and
say
:
"
I
do
not
know
you
be
here

young
Copperfield

"
<EOS>
(
for
it
be
not
the
usual
visiting
room
)
and
cross
by
us
on
his
way
out
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
not
sure
whether
it
be
in
the
pride
of
have
such
a
friend
as
Steerforth
,
or
in
the
desire
to
explain
to
him
how
I
come
to
have
such
a
friend
as
Mr
Peggotty
<EOS>
,
that
I
call
to
him
as
he
be
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
say
,
modestly
---
<EOS>
Good
Heaven
,
how
it
all
come
back
to
me
this
long
time
afterwards
!
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
do

how

"
   
<EOS>
there
be
an
ease
in
his
manner
---
a
gay
and
light
manner
it
be
,
but
not
swagger
---
which
I
still
believe
to
have
bear
a
kind
of
enchantment
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
still
believe
him
,
in
virtue
of
this
carriage
,
his
animal
spirit
,
his
delightful
voice
,
his
handsome
face
and
figure
,
and
,
for
aught
I
know
,
of
some
inborn
power
of
attraction
besides
(
which
I
think
a
few
people
possess
)
,
to
have
carry
a
spell
with
him
to
which
it
be
a
natural
weakness
to
yield
,
and
which
not
many
person
could
withstand
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
see
how
pleased
they
be
with
him
,
and
how
they
seem
to
open
their
heart
to
him
in
a
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
You

let

I

when

<EOS>
"
You

if
Mr

forbid
him

so
vociferously

by
which
he
mean
snail

this
be
in
allusion
to
his
be
slow
to
go

he
have
attempt

go

have
somehow

come

but
I
wish
you

I
wish

"
   
<EOS>
Ham
echo
this
sentiment
,
and
we
part
with
them
in
the
heartiest
manner
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
almost
tempt
that
evening
to
tell
Steerforth
about
pretty
little
em'ly
,
but
I
be
too
timid
of
mention
her
name
,
and
too
much
afraid
of
his
laughing
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
that
I
think
a
good
deal
,
and
in
an
uneasy
sort
of
way
,
about
Mr
Peggotty
have
say
that
she
be
get
on
to
be
a
woman
;
but
I
decide
that
be
nonsense
.
   
<EOS>
We
transport
the
shellfish
,
or
the
"
relish
"
as
Mr
Peggotty
have
modestly
call
it
,
up
into
our
room
unobserved
,
and
make
a
great
supper
that
evening
.
 
<EOS>
but
Traddles
could
not
get
happily
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
too
unfortunate
even
to
come
through
a
supper
like
anybody
else
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
take
ill
in
the
night
---
quite
prostrate
he
be
---
in
consequence
of
Crab
;
and
after
be
drug
with
black
draught
and
blue
pill
,
to
an
extent
which
Demple
(
whose
father
be
a
doctor
)
say
be
enough
to
undermine
a
horse
's
constitution
,
receive
a
caning
and
six
chapter
of
Greek
Testament
for
refuse
to
confess

<EOS>
the
rest
of
the
half

year
be
a
jumble
in
my
recollection
of
the
daily
strife
and
struggle
of
our
life
;
of
the
wane
summer
and
the
change
season
;
of
the
frosty

again
;
of
the

schoolroom
dimly
light

indifferently
warm

and
the
morning
schoolroom
which
be
nothing

,
rainy
Sundays
,
suet
-
pudding

and
a
dirty
atmosphere
of
ink
,
surround
all
.
   
<EOS>
I
well
remember
though
,
how
the
distant
idea
of
the
holiday
,
after
seem
for
an
immense
time
to
be
a
stationary
speck
,
begin
to
come
towards
us
,
and
to
grow
and
grow
.
 
<EOS>
how
from
count
month
,
we
come
to
week
,
and
then
to
day
;
and
how
I
then
begin
to
be
afraid
that
I
should
not
be
send
for
and
when
I
learn
from
Steerforth
that
I
have
be
send
for
,
and
be
certainly
to
go
home
,
have
dim
foreboding
that
I
may
break
my
leg
first
.
 
<EOS>
how
the
breaking
-
up
day
change
its
place
fast
,
at
last
,
from
the
week
after
next
to
next
week
,
this
week
,
the
day
after
tomorrow
,
tomorrow
,
today
,
tonight
---
when
I
be
inside
the
Yarmouth
mail
,
and
go
home
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
many
a
broken
sleep
inside
the
Yarmouth
mail
,
and
many
an
incoherent
dream
of
all
these
thing
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
I
awake
at
interval
,
the
ground
outside
the
window
be
not
the
playground
of
Salem
House
,
and
the
sound
in
my
ear
be
not
the
sound
of
Mr
Creakle
give
it
to
Traddles
,
but
the
sound
of
the
coachman
touch
up
the
horse
.

Chapter

<EOS>
My
holiday
.
 
<EOS>
especially
one
happy
afternoon
 
<EOS>
when
we
arrive
before
day
at
the
inn
where
the
mail
stop
,
which
be
not
the
inn
where
my
friend
the
waiter
live
,
I
be
show
up
to
a
nice
little
bedroom
,
with
DOLPHIN
paint
on
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
very
cold
I
be
,
I
know
,
notwithstanding
the
hot
tea
they
have
give
me
before
a
large
fire
downstairs
;
and
very
glad
I
be
to
turn
into
the
Dolphin
's
bed
,
pull
the
Dolphin
's
blanket
<EOS>
round
my
head
,
and
go
to
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Barkis
the
carrier
be
to
call
for
me
in
the
morning
at
nine
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
up
at
eight
,
a
little
giddy
from
the
shortness
of
my
night
's
rest
,
and
be
ready
for
him
before
the
appoint
time
.
<EOS>
He
receive
me
exactly
as
if
not
five
minute
have
elapse
since
we
be
last
together
,
and
I
have
only
be
into
the
hotel
to
get
change
for
sixpence
,
or
something
of
that
sort
.
   
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
and
my
box
be
in
the
cart
,
and
the
carrier
seat
,
the
lazy
horse
walk
away
with
us
all
at
his
accustomed
pace
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
look
very
well
,
Mr
Barkis
,
"
I
say
,
think
he
would
like
to
know
it
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Barkis
rub
his
cheek
with
his
cuff
,
and
then
look
at
his
cuff
as
if
he
expect
to
find
some
of
the
bloom
upon
it
;
but
make
no
other
acknowledgement
of
the
compliment
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
give
your
message
,
Mr
Barkis
,
"
I
say
:
"
I
write
to
Peggotty

"
   
<EOS>
"
ah

say
Mr
Barkis
.
   
<EOS>
Mr

seem
gruff

and
answer
drily
.
   
<EOS>
"

not
it
right

Barkis

<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
after
a
little
hesitation

<EOS>
"
why

say
Mr
Barkis
.
   
<EOS>

"
   
<EOS>
"
the
message
be
right
enough

perhaps
,

say
Mr
Barkis
;
"
but
it
come
to
an
end
there
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
not
understand
what
he
mean
,
I
repeat
inquisitively
:
"
come
to
an

<EOS>
"
nothing

I
,
open
my
eye

<EOS>
for

be
a
new
light
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
when
a

,
"
say
Mr
Barkis
,
turn
his
glance
slowly
on
me
again
,
"
it

"
   
<EOS>

Would

I
,
doubtfully
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
tell

,
if
you

"
say
Mr

,
with
another
slow
look
at

,
"

<EOS>
"
be

"
say
Mr
Barkis
.
   
<EOS>
He
seem
to
find
an
immense
fund
of
reflection
in
this
circumstance
,
and
sit
ponder
and
inwardly
whistle
for
some
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
well

he
resume
at
length

"
   
<EOS>
this
extremely
artful
suggestion
<EOS>
Mr
Barkis
accompany
with
a
nudge
of
his
elbow
that
give
me
quite
a
stitch
in
my
side
.
 
<EOS>
after
that
,
he
slouch
over
his
horse
in
his
usual
manner
;
and
make
no
other
reference
to
the
subject
except
,
half
an
hour
afterwards
,
take
a
piece
of
chalk
from
his
pocket
,
and
write
up
,
inside
the
tilt
of
the
cart
,
"
Clara
Peggotty
"
---
apparently
as
a
private
memorandum
.
   
<EOS>
ah
,
what
a
strange
feeling
it
be
to
be
go
home
when
it
be
not
home
,
and
to
find
that
every
object
I
look
at
,
remind
me
of
the
happy
old
home
,
which
be
like
a
dream
I
could
never
dream
again
!
<EOS>
the
day
when
my
mother
and
I
and
Peggotty
be
all
in
all
to
one
another
,
and
there
be
no
one
to
come
between
us
,
rise
up
before
me
so
sorrowfully
on
the
road
,
that
I
be
not
sure
I
be
glad
to
be
there
---
not
sure
but
that
I
would
rather
have
remain
away
,
and
forget
it
in
Steerforth
's
company
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
I
be
;
and
soon
I
be
at
our
house
,
where
the
bare
old
elm
-
tree
wrung
their
many
hand
in
the
bleak
wintry
air
,
and
shred
of
the
old
rooks'-nests
drift
away
upon
the
wind
.
   
<EOS>
the
carrier
put
my
box
down
at
the
garden
-
gate
,
and
leave
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk
along
the
path
towards
the
house
,
glance
at
the
window
,
and
fear
at
every
step
to
see
Mr
Murdstone
or
Miss
Murdstone
lower
out
of
one
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
no
face
appear
,
however
;
and
be
come
to
the
house
,
and
know
how
to
open
the
door
,
before
dark
,
without
knock
<EOS>
,
I
go
in
with
a
quiet
,
timid
step
.
   
<EOS>
God
know
how
infantine
the
memory
may
have
be
,
that
be
awaken
within
me
by
the
sound
of
my
mother
's
voice
in
the
old
parlour
,
when
I
set
foot
in
the
hall
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
singe
in
a
low
tone
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
must
have
lain
in
her
arm
,
and
hear
her
singe
so
to
me
when
I
be
but
a
baby
.
 
<EOS>
the
strain
be
new
to
me
,
and
yet
it
be
so
old
that
it
fill
my
heart
brim
-
full
<EOS>
;
like
a
friend
come
back
from
a
long
absence
.
   
<EOS>
I
believe
,
from
the
solitary
and
thoughtful
way
in
which
my
mother
murmur
her
song
,
that
she
be
alone
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
go
softly
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
sit
by
the
fire
,
suckle
an
infant
,
whose
tiny
hand
she
hold
against
her
neck
.
 
<EOS>
Her
eye
be
look
down
upon
its
face
,
and
she
sit
singe
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
far
right
,
that
she
have
no
other
companion
.
   
<EOS>
I
speak
to
her
,
and
she
start
,
and
cry
out
.
 
<EOS>
but
see
me
,
she
call
me
her
dear
Davy
,
her
own
boy
!
<EOS>
and
come
half
across
the
room
to
meet
me
,
kneel
down
upon
the
ground
and
kiss
me
,
and
lay
my
head
down
on
her
bosom
near
the
little
creature
that
be
nestle
there
,
and
put
its
hand
to
my
lip
.
   
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
die
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
die
then
,
with
that
feeling
in
my
heart
!
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
be
more
fit
for
Heaven
than
I
ever
have
be
since
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
be
your
brother
,
"
say
my
mother
,
fondle
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Davy
,
my
pretty
boy
!
 
<EOS>
My
poor
child
!
"
 
<EOS>
then
she
kiss
me
more
and
more
,
and
clasp
me
round
the
neck
.
 
<EOS>
this
she
be
do
when
Peggotty
come
run
in
,
and
bounce
down
on
the
ground
beside
us
,
and
go
mad
about
us
both
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
   
<EOS>
It
seem
that
I
have
not
be
expect
so
soon
,
the
carrier
be
much
before
his
usual
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
,
too
,
that
Mr
and
Miss
Murdstone
have
go
out
upon
a
visit
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
would
not
return
before
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
hope
for
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
think
it
possible
that
we
three
could
be
together
undisturbed
,
once
more
;
and
I
feel
,
for
the
time
,
as
if
the
old
day
be
come
back
.
   
<EOS>
We
dine
together
by
the
fireside
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
be
in
attendance
to
wait
upon
us
,
but
my
mother
would
not
let
her
do
it
,
and
make
her
dine
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
my
own
old
plate
,
with
a
brown
view
of
a
man
-
of
-
war
in
full
sail
upon
it
,
which
Peggotty
have
hoard
somewhere
all
the
time
I
have
be
away
,
and
would
not
have
have
break
,
she
say
,
for
a
hundred
pound
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
my
own
old
mug
with
David
on
it
,
and
my
own
old
little
knife
and
fork
that
would
not
cut
.
   
<EOS>
while
we
be
at
table
,
I
think
it
a
favourable
occasion
to
tell
Peggotty
about
Mr
Barkis
,
who
,
before
I
have
finish
what
I
have
to
tell
her
,
begin
to
laugh
,
and
throw
her
apron
over
her
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Peggotty
,
"
say
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
only
laugh
the
more
,
and
hold
her
apron
tight
over
her
face
when
my
mother
try
to
pull
it
away
,
and
sit
as
if
her
head
be
in
a
bag
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
you
do
,
you
stupid
creature
?
"
say
my
mother
,
laugh
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
drat
the
man
!
<EOS>
"
cry
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
want
to
marry
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
a
very
good
match
for
you
;
would
not
it
?
"
say
my
mother
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
,
"
say
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
ask
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
him
if
he
be
make
of
gold
.
 
<EOS>
nor
I
would
not
have
anybody
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
then
,
why
do
not
you
tell
him
so
,
you
ridiculous
thing
?
"
say
my
mother
.
   
<EOS>
"
tell
him
so
,
"
retort
Peggotty
,
look
out
of
her
apron
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
have
never
say
a
word
to
me
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
better
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
be
to
make
so
bold
as
say
a
word
to
me
,
I
should
slap
his
face
.
"
   
<EOS>
Her
own
be
as
red
as
ever
<EOS>
I
see
it
,
or
any
other
face
,
I
think
;
but
she
only
cover
it
again
,
for
a
few
moment
at
a
time
,
when
she
be
take
with
a
violent
fit
of
laughter
;
and
after
two
or
three
of
those
attack
,
go
on
with
her
dinner
.
   
<EOS>
I
remark
that
my
mother
,
though
she
smile
when
Peggotty
look
at
her
,
become
more
serious
and
thoughtful
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
at
first
that
she
be
change
.
 
<EOS>
Her
face
be
very
pretty
still
,
but
it
look
careworn
,
and
too
delicate
;
and
her
hand
be
so
thin
and
white
<EOS>
that
it
seem
to
me
to
be
almost
transparent
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
change
to
which
I
now
refer
be
superadde
to
this
:
it
be
in
her
manner
,
which
become
anxious
and
fluttered
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
she
say
,
put
out
her
hand
,
and
lay
it
affectionately
on
the
hand
of
her
old
servant
,

come
in
with

her
work

box

and
the
yard

measure
,
and
the
bit
of
wax
-
candle
,
all
just
the
same
as
ever
.
   
<EOS>
We
sit
round
the
fire
,
and
talk
delightfully
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
them
what
a
hard
master
Mr
Creakle
be
,
and
they
pity
me
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
them
what
a
fine
fellow
Steerforth
be

what
a
patron
of
mine
,

Peggotty
say
she
would
walk
a
score

mile
to
see
him

I
take
the
little

in
my
arm

it
be
awake

nurse
it
lovingly
.
 
<EOS>
when
it
be
asleep
again
,
I
creep
close
to
my
mother
's
side
accord
to
my
old
custom
,
break
now
a
long
time
,
and
sit
with
my
arm
embrace
her
waist
,
and
my
little
red
cheek
on
her
shoulder
,
and
once
more
feel
her
beautiful
hair
droop
over
me
---
like
an
angel
's
wing
as
I
use
to
think
,
I
recollect
---
and
be
very
happy
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
while
I
sit
thus
,
look
at
the
fire
,
and
see
picture
in
the
red
-
hot
coal
,
I
almost
believe
that
I
have
never
be
away
;
that
Mr
and
Miss
Murdstone
be
such
picture
,
and
would
vanish
when
the
fire
get
low
;
and
that
there
be
nothing
real
in
all
that
I
remember
,
save
my
mother
,
Peggotty
,
and
I.
   
Peggotty
<EOS>
darn
away
at
a
stocking
as
long
as
she
could
see
,
and
then
sit
with
it
draw
on
her
left
hand
like
a
glove
,
and
her
needle
in
her
right
,
ready
to
take
another
stitch
whenever
there
be
a
blaze
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
conceive
whose
stocking
they
can
have
be
that
Peggotty
be
always
darn
,
or
where
such
an
unfailing
supply
of
stocking
in
want
of
darning
can
have
come
from
.
 
<EOS>
from
my
early
infancy
she
seem
to
have
be
always
employ
in
that
class
of
needlework

never
by
any
chance
in
any
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
,
"

Peggotty

who
be
sometimes
seize
with
a
fit
of
wonder
on
some
most
unexpected
topic

"
what
be
become
of
Davy

great

aunt

I
really

what
can

put

there

"
I
do

how
it

Peggotty
,
"
unless
it
be
on
account
of
be
stupid

my

never

its

They
come

they
go
,

they
do
not
come

they
do
not

just

they
like

I
wonder
what
be

absurd
you
be

Peggotty

if

seem

have
be
at

stern
with
a

Peggotty

you
understand
,
and
so
I
be
sure
do
Davy
,
that
I
be
not
allude
to
anybody
present

it
be
solely
because
he
be
satisfied

He
naturally
love
a

act
solely
for
a
certain
person
's
good
.
<EOS>
He
be
better
able
to
judge
of
it
than
I
be
;
for
I
very
well
know
that
I
be
a
weak

light

girlish
creature

that
he
be
a
firm

grave

serious
man

he
take
,
"

my

with

steal
down

he
take
great
pain
with
me
;
and
I
ought
to
be
very
thankful
to
him

very
submissive
to
him
even
in
my
thought

when
I
be

I
worry

condemn
myself

doubtful

there
,
Peggotty

change
her
tone

be

ever
since
the
night
when
Mr
Copperfield
first
bring

home
here
,

you
come
out
to
the
gate

me

Peggotty
be
not

respond
,

ratify
the
treaty
of
friendship
by
give
me
one
of
her
good
hug
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
some
glimpse
of
the
real
character
of
this
conversation
at
the
time
;
but
I
be
sure
,
now
,
that
the
good
creature
originate
it
,
and
take
her
part
in
it
,
merely
that
my
mother
may
comfort
herself
with
the
little
contradictory
summary
in
which
she
have
indulge
.
 
<EOS>
the
design
be
efficacious
;
for
I
remember
that
my
mother
seem
more
at
ease
during
the
rest
of
the
evening
,
and
that
Peggotty
observe
her
less
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
have
have
our
tea
,
and
the
ashe
be
throw
up
,
and
the
candle
snuff
<EOS>
,
I
read
Peggotty
a
chapter
out
of
the
Crocodile
Book
,
in
remembrance
of
old
time
---
she
take
it
out
of
her
pocket
:
I
do
not
know
whether
she
have
keep
it
there
ever
since
---
<EOS>
and
then
we
talk
about
Salem
House
,
which
bring
me
round
again
to
Steerforth
,
who
be
my
great
subject
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
very
happy
;
and
that
evening
,
as
the
last
of
its
race
,
and
destine
evermore
to
close
that
volume
of
my
life
,
will
never
pass
out
of
my
memory
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
almost
ten
o'clock
before
we
hear
the
sound
of
wheel
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
get
up
then
;
and
my
mother
say
hurriedly
that
,
as
it
be
so
late
,
and
Mr
and
Miss
Murdstone
approve
of
early
hour
for
young
people
,
perhaps
I
have
better
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
kiss
her
,
and
go
upstairs
with
my
candle
directly
,
before
they
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
It
appear
to
my
childish
fancy
,
as
I
ascend
to
the
bedroom
where
I
have
be
imprison
,
that
they
bring
a
cold
blast
of
air
into
the
house
which
blow
away
the
old
familiar
feeling
like
a
feather
.
   
<EOS>
I
feel
uncomfortable
about
go
down
to
breakfast
in
the
morning
,
as
I
have
never
set
eye
on
Mr
Murdstone
since
the
day
when
I
commit
my
memorable
offence
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
as
it
must
be
do
,
I
go
down
,
after
two
or
three
false
start
half
-
way
,
and
as
many
run
back
on
tiptoe
to
my
own
room
,
and
present
myself
in
the
parlour
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
stand
before
the
fire
with
his
back
to
it
,
while
Miss
Murdstone
make
the
tea
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
at
me
steadily
as
I
enter
,
but
make
no
sign
of
recognition
whatever
.
<EOS>
I
go
up
to
him
,
after
a
moment
of
confusion
,
and
say
:
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
sorry
for
what
I
do
,
and
I
hope
you
will
forgive
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
to
hear
you
be
sorry
,
David
,
"
he
reply
.
   
<EOS>
the
hand
he
give
me
be
the
hand
I
have
bite
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
restrain
my
eye
from
rest
for
an
instant
on
a
red
spot
upon
it
;
but
it
be
not
so
red
as
I
turn
,
when
I
meet
that
sinister
expression
in
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
do
,
madam
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
to
Miss
Murdstone
.
   
<EOS>
"
ah
,
dear
me
!
"
sigh
Miss
Murdstone
,
give
me
the
tea
-
caddy
scoop
instead
of
her
finger
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
long
be
the
holiday
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
a
month
,
madam
.
"
   
"
count
from
when
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
from
today
,
madam
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh

"
say
Miss
Murdstone
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
here
be
one
day
off
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
keep
a
calendar
of
the
holiday
in
this
way
,
and
every
morning
check
a
day
off
in
exactly
the
same
manner
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
it
gloomily
until
she
come
to
ten
,
but
when
she
get
into
two
figure
she
become
more
hopeful
,
and
,
as
the
time
advance
,
even
jocular
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
on
this
very
first
day
that
I
have
the
misfortune
to
throw
her
,
though
she
be
not
subject
to
such
weakness
in
general
,
into
a
state
of
violent
consternation
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
into
the
room
where
she
and
my
mother
be
sit
;
and
the
baby
(
who
be
only
a
few
week
old
)
be
on
my
mother
's
lap
<EOS>
,
I
take
it
very
carefully
in
my
arm
.
<EOS>
suddenly
Miss
Murdstone
give
such
a
scream
that
I
all
but
drop
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>

"
cry
my
mother

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"

"
   
<EOS>
She
be
limp
with
horror
;
but
stiffen
herself
to
make
a
dart
at
me
,
and
take
it
out
of
my
arm
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
she
turn
faint
;
and
be
so
very
ill
that
they
be
oblige
to
give
her
cherry
brandy

<EOS>
I
be
solemnly

by
her

on
her
recovery

from

more
on
any
pretence
whatever

and
my
poor

who

I
could

wish
otherwise

meekly
confirm
the
interdict
,
by
say
:
"
no

<EOS>
on
another
occasion

when
we

gently

I

they

alike

<EOS>
"
what

"
<EOS>
My

falter
my

abash

<EOS>
"
who
else

baby

<EOS>
They
be
not
at
all
alike

<EOS>
They
be
exactly
unlike

<EOS>
They
be
utterly
dissimilar
in
all
respect

<EOS>
I
hope
they
will
ever
remain
so

<EOS>
I
will
not

such

make

"
 
<EOS>
with
that
she
stalk
out
,
and
make
the
door
bang
after
her
.
   
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
be
not
a
favourite
with
Miss
Murdstone
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
be
not
a
favourite
there
with
anybody
,
not
even
with
myself
;
for
those
who
do
like
me
could
not
show
it
,
and
those
who
do
not
,
show
it
so
plainly
that
I
have
a
sensitive
consciousness
of
always
appear
constrain
,
boorish
,
and
dull
.
   
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
make
them
as
uncomfortable
as
they
make
me
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
come
into
the
room
where
they
be
,
and
they
be
talk
together
and
my
mother
seem
cheerful
,
an
anxious
cloud
would
steal
over
her
face
from
the
moment
of
my
entrance
.
 
<EOS>
if
Mr
Murdstone
be
in
his
good
humour
,
I
check
him
.
 
<EOS>
if
Miss
Murdstone
be
in
her
bad
,
I
intensify
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
perception
enough
to
know
that
my
mother
be
the
victim
always
;
that
she
be
afraid
to
speak
to
me
or
to
be
kind
to
me
,
lest
she
should
give
them
some
offence
by
her
manner
of
do
so
,
and
receive
a
lecture
afterwards
;
that
she
be
not
only
ceaselessly
afraid
of
her
own
offending
,
but
of
my
offending
,
and
uneasily
watch
their
look
if
I
only
move
.
<EOS>
therefore
I
resolve
to
keep
myself
as
much
out
of
their
way
as
I
could
;
and
many
a
wintry
hour
<EOS>
do
I
hear
the
church
clock
strike
,
when
I
be
sit
in
my
cheerless
bedroom
,
wrap
in
my
little
great
-
coat
,
pore
over
a
book
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
evening
,
sometimes
,
I
go
and
sit
with
Peggotty
in
the
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
there
I
be
comfortable
,
and
not
afraid
of
be
myself
.
<EOS>
but
neither
of
these
resource
be
approve
of
in
the
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
the
torment
humour
which
be
dominant
there
stop
them
both
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
still
hold
to
be
necessary
to
my
poor
mother
's
training
,
and
,
as
one
of
her
trial
,
could
not
be
suffer
to
absent
myself
.

day
after
dinner

you
know
what
will
be
the
consequence
if
you
fail
to
obey
me
to
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
know
well
---
well
perhaps
than
he
think
,
as
far
as
my
poor
mother
be
concern
---
<EOS>
and
I
obey
him
to
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
retreat
to
my
own
room
no
more
;
I
take
refuge
with
Peggotty
no
more
;
but
sit
wearily
in
the
parlour
day
after
day
,
look
forward
to
night
,
and
bedtime
.
   
<EOS>
what
irksome
constraint
I
undergo
,
sit
in
the
same
attitude
hour
upon
hour
,
afraid
to
move
an
arm
or
a
leg
l
Miss
Murdstone
should
complain
(
as
she
do
on
the
least
pretence
)
of
my
restlessness
,
and
afraid
to
move
an
eye
lest
she
should
light
on
some
look
of
dislike
or
scrutiny
that
would
find
new
cause
for
complaint
in
mine
!
 
<EOS>
what
intolerable
dulness
to
sit
listen
to
the
ticking
of
the
clock
;
and
watch
Miss
Murdstone
's
little
shiny
steel
bead
as
she
string
them
;
and
wonder
whether
she
would
ever
be
marry
,
and
if
so
,
to
what
sort
of
unhappy
man
;
and
count
the
division
in
the
moulding
of
the
chimney
-
piece
;
and
wander
away
,
with
my
eye
,
to
the
ceiling
,
among
the
curl
and
corkscrew
in
the
paper
on
the
wall
!
   
<EOS>
what
walk
I
take
alone
,
down
muddy
lane
,
in
the
bad
winter
weather
,
carry
that
parlour
,
and
Mr
and
Miss
Murdstone
in
it
,
everywhere
:
a
monstrous
load
that
I
be
oblige
to
bear
,
a
daymare
that
there
be
no
possibility
of
break
in
,
a
weight
that
brood
on
my
wit
,
and
blunt
them
!
   
<EOS>
what
meal
I
have
in
silence
and
embarrassment
,
always
feel
that
there
be
a
knife
and
fork
too
many
,
and
that
mine
;
an
appetite
too
many
,
and
that
mine
;
a
plate
and
chair
too
many
,
and
those
mine
;
a
somebody
too
many
,
and
that
<EOS>
I
!
   
<EOS>
what
evening
,
when
the
candle
come
,
and
I
be
expect
to
employ
myself
,
but
,
not
dare
to
read
an
entertaining
book
,
pore
over
some
hard
-
head
,
harder
-
hearted
treatise
on
arithmetic
;
when
the
table
of
weight
and
measure
set
themselves
to
tune
,
as
"
Rule
Britannia
"
,
or
"
away
with
Melancholy
"
;
when
they
would
not
stand
still
to
be
learn
,
but
would
go
thread
my
grandmother
's
needle
through
my
unfortunate
head
,
in
at
one
ear
and
out
at
the
other
!
<EOS>
what
yawn
and
doze
I
lapse
into
,
in
spite
of
all
my
care
;
what
start
I
come
out
of
conceal
sleep
with
;
what
answer
I
never
get
,
to
little
observation
that
I
rarely
make
;
what
a
blank
space
I
seem
,
which
everybody
overlook
,
and
yet
be
in
everybody
's
way
;
what
a
heavy
relief
it
be
to
hear
Miss
Murdstone
hail
the
first
stroke
of
nine
at
night
,
and
order
me
to
bed
!
   
<EOS>
thus
the
holiday
lag
away
,
until
the
morning
come
when
Miss
Murdstone
say
:
"
here
be
the
last
day
off
!
"
and
give
me
the
closing
cup
of
tea
of
the
vacation
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
not
sorry
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
lapse
into
a
stupid
state
;
but
I
be
recover
a
little
and
look
forward
to
Steerforth
,
albeit
Mr
Creakle
loom
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
again
Mr
Barkis
appear
at
the
gate
,
and
again
Miss
Murdstone
in
her
warning
voice
,
say
:
"
Clara
!
"
<EOS>
when
my
mother
bend
over
me
,
to
bid
me
farewell
.
   
<EOS>
I
kiss
her
,
and
my
baby
brother
,
and
be
very
sorry
then
;
but
not
sorry
to
go
away
,
for
the
gulf
between
us
be
there
,
and
the
parting
be
there
,
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
not
so
much
the
embrace
she
give
me
,
that
live
in
my
mind
,
though
it
be
as
fervent
as
could
be
,
as
what
follow
the
embrace
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
in
the
carrier
's
cart
when
I
hear
her
call
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
out
,
and
she
stand
at
the
garden
-
gate
alone
,
hold
her
baby
up
in
her
arm
for
me
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
cold
still
weather
;
and
not
a
hair
of
her
head
,
nor
a
fold
of
her
dress
,
be
stir
,
as
she
look
intently
at
me
,
hold
up
her
child
.
   
<EOS>
so
I
lose
her
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
see
her
afterwards
,
in
my
sleep
at
school
---
<EOS>
a
silent
presence
near
my
bed
---
look
at
me
with
the
same
intent
face
---
hold
up
her
baby
in
her
arm
.

Chapter
9
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
memorable
birthday
 
<EOS>
I
pass
over
all
that
happen
at
school
,
until
the
anniversary
of
my
birthday
come
round
in
March
.
 
<EOS>
except
that
Steerforth
be
more
to
be
admire
than
ever
,
I
remember
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
go
away
at
the
end
of
the
half
-
year
,
if
not
sooner
,
and
be
more
spirited
and
independent
than
before
in
my
eye
,
and
therefore
more
engaging
than
before
;
but
beyond
this
I
remember
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
remembrance
by
which
that
time
be
mark
in
my
mind
,
seem
to
have
swallow
up
all
less
recollection
,
and
to
exist
alone
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
even
difficult
for
me
to
believe
that
there
be
a
gap
of
full
two
month
between
my
return
to
Salem
House
and
the
arrival
of
that
birthday
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
only
understand
that
the
fact
be
so
,
because
I
know
it
must
have
be
so
;
otherwise
I
should
feel
convinced
that
there
be
no
interval
,
and
that
the
one
occasion
tread
upon
the
other
's
heel
.
   
<EOS>
how
well
I
recollect
the
kind
of
day
it
be
!
 
<EOS>
I
smell
the
fog
that
hang
about
the
place
;
I
see
the
hoar
frost
,
ghostly
,
through
it
;
I
feel
my
rimy
hair
fall
clammy
on
my
cheek
;
I
look
along
the
dim
perspective
of
the
schoolroom
,
with
a
sputtering
candle
here
and
there
to
light
up
the
foggy
morning
,
and
the
breath
of
the
boy
wreathe
and
smoke
in
the
raw
cold
as
they
blow
upon
their
finger
,
and
tap
their
foot
upon
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
after
breakfast
,
and
we
have
be
summon
in
from
the
playground
,
when
Mr
Sharp
enter
and
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
David
Copperfield
be
to
go
into
the
parlour
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
expect
a
hamper
from
Peggotty
,
and
brighten
at
the
order
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
boy
about
me
put
in
their
claim
not
to
be
forget
in
the
distribution
of
the
good
thing
,
as
I
get
out
of
my
seat
with
great
alacrity
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
not
hurry
,
David
,
"
say
Mr
Sharp
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
time
enough
,
my
boy
,
do
not
hurry
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
may
have
be
surprise
by
the
feel
tone
in
which
he
speak
,
if
I
have
give
it
a
thought
;
but
I
give
it
none
until
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
hurry
away
to
the
parlour
;
and
there
I
find
Mr
Creakle
,
sit
at
his
breakfast
with
the
cane
and
a
newspaper
before
him
,
and
Mrs
Creakle
with
an
open
letter
in
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
but
no
hamper
.
   
<EOS>
"
David
Copperfield
,
"
say
Mrs
Creakle
,
lead
me
to
a
sofa
,
and
sit
down
beside
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
very
particularly
.
<EOS>
I
have
something
to
tell
you
,
my
child
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Creakle
,
at
whom
of
course
I
look
,
shake
his
head
without
look
at
me
,
and
stop
up
a
sigh
with
a
very
large
piece
of
butter
toast
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
too
young
to
know
how
the
world
change
every
day
,
"
say
Mrs
Creakle
,
"
and
how
the
people
in
it
pass
away
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
all
have
to
learn
it
,
David
;
some
of
us
when
we
be
young
,
some
of
us
when
we
be
old
,
some
of
us
at
all
time
of
our
life
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
look
at
her
earnestly
.
   
<EOS>
"
when
you
come
away
from
home
at
the
end
of
the
vacation
,
"
say
Mrs
Creakle
,
after
a
pause
,
"
be
they
all
well
?
"
 
<EOS>
after
another
pause
,
"
be
your
mama
well
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
tremble
without
distinctly
know
why
,
and
still
look
at
her
earnestly
,
make
no
attempt
to
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
because
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
grieve
to
tell
you
that
I
hear
this
morning
your
mama
be
very
ill
.
"
   
<EOS>
a
mist
rise
between
Mrs
Creakle
and
me
,
and
her
figure
seem
to
move
in
it
for
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
feel
the
burn
tear
run
down
my
face
,
and
it
be
steady
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
be
very
dangerously
ill
,
"
she
add
.
   
<EOS>
I
know
all
now
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
be
dead
.
"
   
<EOS>
there
be
no
need
to
tell
me
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
already
break
out
into
a
desolate
cry
,
and
feel
an
orphan
in
the
wide
world
.
   
<EOS>
She
be
very
kind
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
keep
me
there
all
day
,
and
leave
me
alone
sometimes
;
and
I
cry
,
and
wear
myself
to
sleep
,
and
awake
and
cry
again
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
could
cry
no
more
,
I
begin
to
think
;
and
then
the
oppression
on
my
breast
be
heavy
,
and
my
grief
a
dull
pain
that
there
be
no
ease
for
.
   
<EOS>
and
yet
my
thought
be
idle
;
not
intent
on
the
calamity
that
weigh
upon
my
heart
,
but
idly
loiter
near
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
of
our
house
shut
up
and
hush
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
of
the
little
baby
,
who
,
Mrs
Creakle
say
,
have
be
pine
away
for
some
time
,
and
who
,
they
believe
,
would
die
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
of
my
father
's
grave
in
the
churchyard
,
by
our
house
,
and
of
my
mother
lie
there
beneath
the
tree
I
know
so
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
stand
upon
a
chair
when
I
be
leave
alone
,
and
look
into
the
glass
to
see
how
red
my
eye
be
,
and
how
sorrowful
my
face
.
 
<EOS>
I
consider
,
after
some
hour
be
go
,
<EOS>
if
my
tear
be
really
hard
to
flow
now
,
as
they
seem
to
be
,
what
,
in
connexion
with
my
loss
,
it
would
affect
me
most
to
think
of
when
I
draw
near
home
---
for
I
be
go
home
to
the
funeral
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sensible
of
have
feel
that
a
dignity
attach
to
me
among
the
rest
of
the
boy
,
and
that
I
be
important
in
my
affliction
.
   
<EOS>
if
ever
child
be
stricken
with
sincere
grief
,
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
remember
that
this
importance
be
a
kind
of
satisfaction
to
me
,
when
I
walk
in
the
playground
that
afternoon
while
the
boy
be
in
school
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
see
them
glance
at
me
out
of
the
window
,
as
they
go
up
to
their
class
,
I
feel
distinguished
,
and
look
more
melancholy
,
and
walk
slower
.
 
<EOS>
when
school
be
over
,
and
they
come
out
and
speak
to
me
,
I
feel
it
rather
good
in
myself
not
to
be
proud
to
any
of
them
,
and
to
take
exactly
the
same
notice
of
them
all
,
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
to
go
home
next
night
;
not
by
the
mail
,
but
by
the
heavy
night
-
coach
,
which
be
call
the
Farmer
,
and
be
principally
use
by
country
-
people
travel
short
intermediate
distance
upon
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
no
story
<EOS>
-
tell
that
evening
,
and
Traddles
insist
on
lend
me
his
pillow
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
<EOS>
what
good
he
think
it
would
do
me
,
for
I
have
one
of
my
own
:
<EOS>
but
it
be
all
he
have
to
lend
,
poor
fellow
,
except
a
sheet
of
letter
-
paper
full
of
skeleton
;
and
that
he
give
me
at
parting
,
as
a
soother
of
my
sorrow
and
a
contribution
to
my
peace
of
mind
.
   
<EOS>
I
leave
Salem
House
upon
the
morrow
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
I
little
think
then
that
I
leave
it
,
never
to
return
.
 
<EOS>
We
travel
very
slowly
all
night
,
and
do
not
get
into
Yarmouth
before
nine
or
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
out
for
Mr
Barkis
,
but
he
be
not
there
;
and
instead
of
him
a
fat
,
short
-
winded
,
merry
-
looking
,
little
old
man
in
black
,
with
rusty
little
bunche
of
ribbon
at
the
knee
of
his
breech
,
black
stocking
,
and
a
broad
-
brim
hat
,
come
puff
up
to
the
coach
window
,
and
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
Master
Copperfield
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
come
with
me
,
young
sir
,
if
you
please
,
"
he
say
,
open
the
door
,
"
and
I
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
take
you
home
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
put
my
hand
in
his
,
wonder
who
he
be
,
and
we
walk
away
to
a
shop
in
a
narrow
street
,
on
which
be
write
OMER
,
DRAPER
,
TAILOR
,
HABERDASHER
,
FUNERAL
FURNISHER
,
&
c.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
close
and
stifle
little
shop
;
full
of
all
sort
of
clothing
,
make
and
unmade
,
include
one
window
full
of
beaver
-
hat
and
bonnet
.
 
<EOS>
We
go
into
a
little
back
-
parlour
behind
the
shop
,
where
we
find
three
young
woman
at
work
on
a
quantity
of
black
material
,
which
be
heap
upon
the
table
,
and
little
bit
and
cutting
of
which
be
litter
all
over
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
good
fire
in
the
room
,
and
a
breathless
smell
of
warm
black
crape
---
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
the
smell
be
then
,
but
I
know
now
.
   
<EOS>
the
three
young
woman
,
who
appear
to
be
very
industrious
and
comfortable
,
raise
their

at

<EOS>
Mr

take
off

He

<EOS>
"
as
I

Would

Master
Copperfield

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
precede
Mr

,
in
compliance
with
his
request
;
and
after
show
me
a
roll
of
cloth
which
he
say
be
extra
super

and
too
good
mourning
for
anything
short
of
parent

he
take
my
various
dimension

and
put
them
down
in
a
book

<EOS>
while
he
be
record
them
he
call
my
attention
to
his
stock
in
trade
,
and
to
certain
fashion
which
he
say
have
"
just
come
up
"
,
and
to
certain
other
fashion
which
he
say
have
"
just
go
out
"
.
   
<EOS>
"
and
by
that
sort
of
thing
we
very
often
lose
a
little
mint
of
money

say
Mr
Omer
.
 
<EOS>

but
fashion
be
like
human

<EOS>
They
come
in

nobody

why

or
how

and
they
go
out

nobody

why

<EOS>
everything
be
like
life

in
my
opinion
,
if
you
look
at
it
in
that
point
of
view

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
too
sorrowful
to
discuss
the
question
,
which
would
possibly
have
be
beyond
me
under
any
circumstance
;
and
Mr
Omer
take
me
back
into
the
parlour
,
breathe
with
some
difficulty
on
the
way
.
   
<EOS>
He
then
call
down
a
little
break

neck
range
of
step
behind
a
door
:
"
bring
up
that
tea

bread

"
<EOS>
which
,
after
some
time
,
during
which
I
sit
look
about
me
and
think
,
and
listen
to
the
stitching
in
the
room

<EOS>
My
wound
break
out
afresh
at
this
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
I
leave
the
scarcely

taste
breakfast
,
and
go
and
rest
my
head
on
another
table
,
in
a
corner
of
the
little
room
,
which
Minnie
hastily
clear
,
lest
I
should
spot
the
mourning

be
lie
there
with

<EOS>
She
be
a
pretty

good

natured
girl

and
put
my
hair
away
from

very
cheerful
at
have
nearly
finish

<EOS>
presently

leave
off

and
a
good

<EOS>
He

and
his

be
full
of
little
nail

which
he
be

<EOS>
"

Minnie

Will

no

Minnie
interpose

<EOS>
"
I
think
it
may
be
agreeable
,
my

"
say
Mr
Omer
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
perhaps
you
be
right
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
how
I
know
it
be
my
dear
,
dear
mother
's
coffin
that
they
go
to
look
at
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
hear
one
make
;
I
have
never
see
one
that
I
know
of
:
but
it
come
into
my
mind
what
the
noise
be
,
while
it
be
go
on
;
and
when
the
young
man
enter
,
I
be
sure
I
know
what
he
have
be
do
.
   
<EOS>
the
work
be
now
finish
,
the
two
girl
,
whose
name
I
have
not
hear
,
brush
the
shred
and
thread
from
their
dress
,
and
go
into
the
shop
to
put
that
to
right
,
and
wait
for
customer
.
<EOS>
Minnie
stay
behind
to
fold
up
what
they
have
make
,
and
pack
it
in
two
basket
.
 
<EOS>
this
she
do
upon
her
knee
,
hum
a
lively
little
tune
the
while
.
 
<EOS>
Joram
,
who
I
have
no
doubt
be
her
lover
,
come
in
and
steal
a
kiss
from
her
while
she
be
busy
(
he
do
not
appear
to
mind
me
,
at
all
)
,
and
say
her
father
be
go
for
the
chaise
,
and
he
must
make
haste
and
get
himself
ready
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
go
out
again
;
and
then
she
put
her
thimble
and
scissor
in
her
pocket
,
and
stick
a
needle
thread
with
black
thread
neatly
in
the
bosom
of
her
gown
,
and
put
on
her
outer
clothing
smartly
,
at
a
little
glass
behind
the
door
,
in
which
I
see
the
reflection
of
her
pleased
face
.
   
<EOS>
all
this
I
observe
,
sit
at
the
table
in
the
corner
with
my
head
lean
on
my
hand
,
and
my
thought
run
on
very
different
thing
.
 
<EOS>
the
chaise
soon
come
round
to
the
front
of
the
shop
,
and
the
basket
be
put
in
first
,
I
be
put
in
next
,
and
those
three
follow
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
it
as
a
kind
of
half
chaise
-
cart
,
half
pianoforte
-
van
,
paint
of
a
sombre
colour
,
and
draw
by
a
black
horse
with
a
long
tail
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
plenty
of
room
for
us
all
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
I
have
ever
experience
so
strange
a
feeling
in
my
life
<EOS>
(
I
be
wise
now
,
perhaps
)
as
that
of
be
with
them
,
remember
how
they
have
be
employ
,
and
see
them
enjoy
the
ride
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
angry
with
them
;
I
be
more
afraid
of
them
,
as
if
I
be
cast
away
among
creature
with
whom
I
have
no
community
of
nature
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
very
cheerful
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
man
sit
in
front
to
drive
,
and
the
two
young
people
sit
behind
him
,
and
whenever
he
speak
to
them
lean
forward
,
the
one
on
one
side
of
his
chubby
face
and
the
other
on
the
other
,
and
make
a
great
deal
of
him
.
<EOS>
They
would
have
talk
to
me
too
,
but
I
hold
back
,
and
mope
in
my
corner
;
scare
by
their
love
-
making
and
hilarity
,
though
it
be
far
from
boisterous
,
and
almost
wonder
that
no
judgement
come
upon
them
for
their
hardness
of
heart
.
   
<EOS>
so
,
when
they
stop
to
bait
the
horse
,
and
eat
and
drank
and
enjoy
themselves
,
I
could
touch
nothing
that
they
touch
,
but
keep
my
fast
unbroken
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
when
we
reach
home
,
I
drop
out
of
the
chaise
behind
,
as
quickly
as
possible
,
that
I
may
not
be
in
their
company
before
those
solemn
window
,
look
blindly
on
me
like
closed
eye
once
bright
.
 
<EOS>
and
oh
,
how
little
need
I
have
have
to
think
what
would
move
me
to
tear
when
I
come
back
---
see
the
window
of
my
mother
's
room
,
and
next
it
that
which
,
in
the
well
time
,
be
mine
!
   
<EOS>
I
be
in
Peggotty
's
arm
before
I
get
to
the
door
,
and
she
take
me
into
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Her
grief
burst
out
when
she
first
see
me
;
but
she
control
it
soon
,
and
speak
in
whisper
,
and
walk
softly
,
as
if
the
dead
could
be
disturb
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
not
be
in
bed
,
I
find
,
for
a
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
She
sit
up
at
night
still
,
and
watch
.
 
<EOS>
as
long
as
her
poor
dear
pretty
be
above
the
ground
,
she
say
,
she
would
never
desert
her
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Murdstone
take
no
heed
of
me
when
I
go
into
the
parlour
where
he
be
,
but
sit
by
the
fireside
,
weep
silently
,
and
ponder
in
his
elbow
-
chair
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
,
who
be
busy
at
her
writing
-
desk
,
which
be
cover
with
letter
and
paper
,
give
me
her
cold
finger
-
nail
,
and
ask
me
,
in
an
iron
whisper
,
if
I
have
be
measure
for
my
mourning
.
   
<EOS>
I
say
:
"
yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
your
shirt
,
"
say
Miss
Murdstone
;
"
have
you
bring
'em
home
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
madam
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
bring
home
all
my
clothe
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
this
be
all
the
consolation
that
her
firmness
administer
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
doubt
that
she
have
a
choice
pleasure
in
exhibit
what
she
call
her
self
-
command
,
and
her
firmness
,
and
her
strength
of
mind
,
and
her
common
sense
,
and
the
whole
diabolical
catalogue
of
her
unamiable
quality
,
on
such
an
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
particularly
proud
of
her
turn
for
business
;
and
she
show
it
now
in
reduce
everything
to
pen
and
ink
,
and
be
move
by
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
rest
of
that
day
,
and
from
morning
to
night
afterwards
<EOS>
,
she
sit
at
that
desk
,
scratch
composedly
with
a
hard
pen
,
speak
in
the
same
imperturbable
whisper
to
everybody
;
never
relax
a
muscle
of
her
face
,
or
soften
a
tone
of
her
voice
,
or
appear
with
an
atom
of
her
dress
astray
.
   
<EOS>
Her
brother
take
a
book
sometimes
,
but
never
read
it
that
I
see
.
<EOS>
He
would
open
it
and
look
at
it
as
if
he
be
read
,
but
would
remain
for
a
whole
hour
without
turn
the
leaf
,
and
then
put
it
down
and
walk
to
and
fro
in
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
use
to
sit
with
folded
hand
watch
him
,
and
count
his
footstep
,
hour
after
hour
.
<EOS>
He
very
seldom
speak
to
her
,
and
never
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
to
be
the
only
restless
thing
,
except
the
clock
,
in
the
whole
motionless
house
.
   
<EOS>
in
these
day
before
the
funeral
,
I
see
but
little
of
Peggotty
,
except
that
,
in
pass
up
or
down
stair
,
I
always
find
her
close
to
the
room
where
my
mother
and
her
baby
lie
,
and
except
that
she
come
to
me
every
night
,
and
sit
by
my
bed
's
head
while
I
go
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
a
day
or
two
before
the
burial
---
I
think
it
be
a
day
or
two
before
,
but
I
be
conscious
of
confusion
in
my
mind
about
that
heavy
time
,
with
nothing
to
mark
its
progress
---
she
take
me
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
recollect
that
underneath
some
white
covering
on
the
bed
,
with
a
beautiful
cleanliness
and
freshness
all
around
it
,
there
seem
to
me
to
lie
embody
the
solemn
stillness
that
be
in
the
house
;
and
that
when
she
would
have
turn
the
cover
gently
back
,
I
cry
:
"
<EOS>
oh
no
!
 
<EOS>
oh
no
!
"
and
hold
her
hand
.
   
<EOS>
if
the
funeral
have
be
yesterday
,
I
could
not
recollect
it
better
.
<EOS>
the
very
air
of
the
good
parlour
,
when
I
go
in
at
the
door
,
the
bright
condition
of
the
fire
,
the
shining
of
the
wine
in
the
decanter
,
the
pattern
of
the
glass
and
plate
,
the
faint
sweet
smell
of
cake
,
the
odour
of
Miss
Murdstone
's
dress
,
and
our
black
clothe
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chillip
be
in
the
room
,
and
come
to
speak
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
how
be
Master
David
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
kindly
.
   
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
him
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
him
my
hand
,
which
he
hold
in
his
.
   
<EOS>
"
dear
me
!
"
say
Mr
Chillip
,
meekly
smile
,
with
something
shine
in
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
Our
little
friend
grow
up
around
us
.
 
<EOS>
They
grow
out
of
our
knowledge
,
madam
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
to
Miss
Murdstone
,
who
make
no
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
great
improvement
here
,
madam
?
"
say
Mr
Chillip
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
merely
answer
with
a
frown
and
a
formal
bend
:
<EOS>
Mr
Chillip
,
discomfit
,
go
into
a
corner
,
keep
me
with
him
,
and
open
his
mouth
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
I
remark
this
,
because
I
remark
everything
that
happen
,
not
because
I
care
about
myself
,
or
have
do
since
I
come
home
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
the
bell
begin
to
sound
,
and
Mr
Omer
and
another
come
to
make
us
ready
.
 
<EOS>
as
Peggotty
be
will
not
to
tell
me
,
long
ago
,
the
follower
of
my
father
to
the
same
grave
be
make
ready
in
the
same
room
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
Mr
Murdstone
,
our
neighbour
Mr
Grayper
,
Mr
Chillip
,
and
i.
 
<EOS>
when
we
go
out
to
the
door
,
the
Bearers
and
their
load
be
in
the
garden
;
and
they
move
before
us
down
the
path
,
and
past
the
elm
,
and
through
the
gate
,
and
into
the
churchyard
,
where
I
have
so
often
hear
the
bird
sing
on
a
summer
morning
.
   
<EOS>
We
stand
around
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
seem
different
to
me
from
every
other
day
,
and
the
light
not
of
the
same
colour
---
of
a
sad
colour
.
 
<EOS>
now
there
be
a
solemn
hush
,
which
we
have
bring
from
home
with
what
be
rest
in
the
mould
;
and
while
we
stand
bareheade
,
I
hear
the
voice
of
the
clergyman
,
sound
remote
in
the
open
air
,
and
yet
distinct
and
plain
,
say
:
"
I
be
the
Resurrection
and
the
Life
,
saith
the
Lord
!
"
 
<EOS>
then
I
hear
sobs
;
and
,
stand
apart
among
the
looker
-
on
,
I
see
that
good
and
faithful
servant
,
whom
of
all
the
people
upon
earth
<EOS>
I
love
the
good
,
and
unto
whom
my
childish
heart
be
certain
that
the
Lord
will
one
day
say
:
"
well
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
there
be
many
face
that
I
know
,
among
the
little
crowd
;
face
that
I
know
in
church
,
when
mine
be
always
wonder
there
;
face
that
first
see
my
mother
,
when
she
come
to
the
village
in
her
youthful
bloom
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
mind
them
<EOS>
---
I
mind
nothing
but
my
grief
---
<EOS>
and
yet
I
see
and
know
them
all
;
and
even
in
the
background
,
far
away
,
see
Minnie
look
on
,
and
her
eye
glance
on
her
sweetheart
,
who
be
near
me
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
over
,
and
the
earth
be
fill
in
,
and
we
turn
to
come
away
.
<EOS>
before
us
stand
our
house
,
so
pretty
and
unchanged
,
so
link
in
my
mind
with
the
young
idea
of
what
be
go
,
that
all
my
sorrow
have
be
nothing
to
the
sorrow
it
call
forth
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
take
me
on
;
and
Mr
Chillip
talk
to
me
;
and
when
we
get
home
,
put
some
water
to
my
lip
;
and
when
I
ask
his
leave
to
go
up
to
my
room
,
dismiss
me
with
the
gentleness
of
a
woman
.
   
<EOS>
all
this
,
I
say
,
be
yesterday
's
event
.
 
<EOS>
event
of
later
date
have
float
from
me
to
the
shore
where
all
forget
thing
will
reappear
,
but
this
stand
like
a
high
rock
in
the
ocean
.
   
<EOS>
I
know
that
Peggotty
would
come
to
me
in
my
room
.
 
<EOS>
the
Sabbath
stillness
of
the
time
<EOS>
(
the
day
be
so
like
Sunday
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
forget
that
)
be
suit
to
us
both
.
 
<EOS>
She
sit
down
by
my
side
upon
my
little
bed
;
and
hold
my
hand
,
and
sometimes
put
it
to
her
lip
,
and
sometimes
smooth
it
with
her
,
as
she
may
have
comfort
my
little
brother
,
tell
me
,
in
her
way
,
all
that
she
have
to
tell
concern
what
have
happen
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
be
never
well
,
"
say
Peggotty
,
"
for
a
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
uncertain
in
her
mind
,
and
not
happy
.
 
<EOS>
when
her
baby
be
bear
,
I
think
at
first
she
would
get
well
,
but
she
be
more
delicate
,
and
sink
a
little
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
She
use
to
like
to
sit
alone
before
her
baby
come
,
and
then
she
cry
;
but
afterwards
she
use
to
sing
to
it
---
<EOS>
so
soft
,
that
I
once
think
,
when
I
hear
her
,
it
be
like
a
voice
up
in
the
air
,
that
be
rise
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
get
to
be
more
timid
,
and
more
frightened
-
like
,
of
late
;
and
that
a
hard
word
be
like
a
blow
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
always
the
same
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
change
to
her
foolish
Peggotty
,
do
not
my
sweet
girl
.
"
   
<EOS>
here
Peggotty
stop
,
and
softly
beat
upon
my
hand
a
little
while
.
   
<EOS>
"
the
last
time
that
I
see
her
like
her
own
old
self
,
be
the
night
when
you
come
home
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
you
go
away
,
she
say
to
me
,
"
I
never
shall
see
my
pretty
darling
again
.
 
<EOS>
something
tell
me
so
,
that
tell
the
truth
,
I
know
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
She
try
to
hold
up
after
that
;
and
many
a
time
,
when
they
tell
her
she
be
thoughtless
and
light
-
hearted
,
make
believe
to
be
so
;
but
it
be
all
a
bygone
then
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
tell
her
husband
what
she
have
tell
me
---
she
be
afraid
of
say
it
to
anybody
else
---
till
one
night
,
a
little
more
than
a
week
before
it
happen
,
when
she
say
to
him
:
"
My
dear
,
I
think
I
be
die
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
"
It
be
off
my
mind
now
,
Peggotty
,
"
she
tell
me
,
when
I
lay
her
in
her
bed
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
will
believe
it
more
and
more
,
poor
fellow
,
every
day
for
a
few
day
to
come
;
and
then
it
will
be
past
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
tired
.
 
<EOS>
if
this
be
sleep
,
sit
by
me
while
I
sleep
:
do
not
leave
me
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
both
my
child
!
 
<EOS>
God
protect
and
keep
my
fatherless
boy

"
<EOS>
"
   
"
I
never
leave
her
afterwards
,
"
say
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
often
talk
to
them
two
downstair
---
for
she
love
them
;
she
could
not
bear
not
to
love
anyone
who
be
about
her
---
but
when
they
go
away
from
her
bed
-
side
,
she
always
turn
to
me
,
as
if
there
be
rest
where
Peggotty
be
,
and
never
fall
asleep
in
any
other
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
on
the
last
night
,
in
the
evening
,
she
kiss
me
,
and
say
:
"
if
my
baby
should
die
too
,
Peggotty
,
please
let
them
lay
him
in
my
arm

bury
us
together

(
It

a
day
beyond

another
silence
follow
this
,
and
another
gentle
beating
on
my
hand

<EOS>
"
It
be
pretty
far
in
the
night

Peggotty
,
"
when
she
ask
me
for
some
drink
;

when
she
have
take
it

give
me
such
a
patient

so

Daybreak
have
come
,
and
the
sun
be
rise
,
when
she
say
to
me
,
how
kind
and
considerate
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
have
always
be
to
her
,
and
how
he
have
bear
with
her

tell
her
,
when
she
doubt
herself
,
that
a

heart
be
well

strong

that

my

nearer

put
it
as

oh
Davy

<EOS>
the
time
have
come
when
my
first
parting
word
to
you
be
true
---
when
she
be
glad
to
lay
her
poor
head
on
her
stupid
cross
old
Peggotty
's
arm
---
and
she
die
like
a
child
that
have
go
to
sleep
!
"
   
<EOS>
thus
end
Peggotty
's
narration
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
moment
of
my
knowing
of
the
death
of
my
mother
,
the
idea
of
her
as
she
have
be
of
late
have
vanish
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
her
,
from
that
instant
,
only
as
the
young
mother
of
my
early
impression
,
who
have
be
use
to
wind
her
bright
curl
round
and
round
her
finger
,
and
to
dance
with
me
at
twilight
in
the
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
what
Peggotty
have
tell
me
now
,
be
so
far
from
bring
me
back
to
the
later
period
,
that
it
root
the
early
image
in
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
curious
,
but
it
be
true
.
 
<EOS>
in
her
death
she
wing
her
way
back
to
her
calm
untroubled
youth
,
and
cancel
all
the
rest
.
   
<EOS>
the
mother
who
lie
in
the
grave
,
be
the
mother
of
my
infancy
;
the
little
creature
in
her
arm
,
be
myself
,
as
I
have
once
be
,
hush
for
ever
on
her
bosom

Chapter
10

<EOS>
I
become
neglect
,
and
be
provide
for
 
the
first
act
of
business
Miss
Murdstone
perform
when
the
day
of
the
solemnity
be
over
,
and
light
be
freely
admit
into
the
house
,
be
to
give
Peggotty
a
month
's
warning
.
 
<EOS>
much
as
Peggotty
would
have
dislike
such
a
service
,
I
believe
she
would
have
retain
it
,
for
my
sake
,
in
preference
to
the
good
upon
earth
.
<EOS>
She
tell
me
we
must
part
,
and
tell
me
why
;
and
we
condole
with
one
another
,
in
all
sincerity
.
   
<EOS>
as
to
me
or
my
future
,
not
a
word
be
say
,
or
a
step
take
.
 
<EOS>
Happy
<EOS>
they
would
have
be
,
I
dare
say
,
if
they
could
have
dismiss
me
at
a
month
's
warning
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
muster
courage
once
,
to
ask
Miss
Murdstone
when
I
be
go
back
to
school
;
and
she
answer
dryly
,
she
believe
I
be
not
go
back
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
tell
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
anxious
to
know
what
be
go
to
be
do
with
me
,
and
so
be
Peggotty
;
but
neither
she
nor
I
could
pick
up
any
information
on
the
subject
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
one
change
in
my
condition
,
which
,
while
it
relieve
me
of
a
great
deal
of
present
uneasiness
,
may
have
make
me
,
if
I
have
be
capable
of
consider
it
closely
,
yet
more
uncomfortable
about
the
future
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
this
.
 
<EOS>
the
constraint
that
have
be
put
upon
me
,
be
quite
abandon
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
far
from
be
require
to
keep
my
dull
post
in
the
parlour
<EOS>
,
that
on
several
occasion
,
when
I
take
my
seat
there
,
Miss
Murdstone
frown
to
me
to
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
far
from
be
warn
off
from
Peggotty
's
society
,
that
,
provide
I
be
not
in
Mr
Murdstone
's
,
I
be
never
seek
out
or
inquire
for
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
I
be
in
daily
dread
of
his
take
my
education
in
hand
again
,
or
of
Miss
Murdstone
's
devote
herself
to
it
;
but
I
soon
begin
to
think
that
such
fear
be
groundless
,
and
that
all
I
have
to
anticipate
be
neglect
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
conceive
that
this
discovery
give
me
much
pain
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
still
giddy
with
the
shock
of
my
mother
's
death
,
and
in
a
kind
of
stunned
state
as
to
all
tributary
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
recollect
,
indeed
,
to
have
speculate
,
at
odd
time
,
on
the
possibility
of
my
not
be
teach
any
more
,
or
care
for
any
more
;
and
grow
up
to
be
a
shabby
,
moody
man
,
lounge
an
idle
life
away
,
about
the
village
;
as
well
as
on
the
feasibility
of
my
get
rid
of
this
picture
by
go
away
somewhere
,
like
the
hero
in
a
story
,
to
seek
my
fortune
:
but
these
be
transient
vision
,
daydream
<EOS>
I
sit
look
at
sometimes
,
as
if
they
be
faintly
paint
or
write
on
the
wall
of
my
room
,
and
which
,
as
they
melt
away
,
leave
the
wall
blank
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Peggotty
,
"
I
say
in
a
thoughtful
whisper
,
one
evening
,
when
I
be
warm
my
hand
at
the
kitchen
fire
,
"
<EOS>
Mr
Murdstone
like
me
less
than
he
use
to
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
like
me
much
,
Peggotty
;
but
he
would
rather
not
even
see
me
now
,
if
he
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
perhaps
it
be
his
sorrow
,
"
say
Peggotty
,
stroke
my
hair
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
,
Peggotty
,
I
be
sorry
too
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
believe
it
be
his
sorrow
,
I
should
not
think
of
it
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
that
;
<EOS>
oh
,
no
,
it
be
not
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
know
it
be
not
that
?
"
say
Peggotty
,
after
a
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
his
sorrow
be
another
and
quite
a
different
thing
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
sorry
at
this
moment
,
sit
by
the
fireside
with
Miss
Murdstone
;
but
if
I
be
to
go
in
,
Peggotty
,
he
would
be
something
besides
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
what
would
he
be
?
"
say
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
angry
,
"
I
answer
,
with
an
involuntary
imitation
of
his
dark
frown
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
he
be
only
sorry
,
he
would
not
look
at
me
as
he
do
.
<EOS>
I
be
only
sorry
,
and
it
make
me
feel
kind
.
"
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
say
nothing
for
a
little
while
;
and
I
warm
my
hand
,
as
silent
as
she
.
   
<EOS>
"
Davy
,
"
she
say
at
length
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
Peggotty
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
try
,
my
dear
,
all
way
I
could
think
of
---
all
the
way
there
be
,
and
all
the
way
there
be
not
,
in
short
---
to
get
a
suitable
service
here
,
in
Blunderstone
;
but
there
be
no
such
a
thing
,
my
love
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
and
what
do
you
mean
to
do
,
Peggotty
,
"
say
I
,
wistfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
mean
to
go
and
seek
your
fortune
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
expect
I
shall
be
force
to
go
to
Yarmouth
,
"
reply
Peggotty
,
"
and
live
there
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
have
go
farther
off
,
"
I
say
,
brighten
a
little
,
"
and
be
as
bad
as
lose
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
see
you
sometimes
,
<EOS>
my
dear
old
Peggotty
,
there
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
not
be
quite
at
the
other
end
of
the
world
,
will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
contrary
way
,
please
God
!
"
cry
Peggotty
,
with
great
animation
.
<EOS>
"
as
long
as
you
be
here
,
my
pet
,
I
shall
come
over
every
week
of
my
life
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
one
day
,
every
week
of
my
life
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
feel
a
great
weight
take
off
my
mind
by
this
promise
:
but
even
this
be
not
all
,
for
Peggotty
go
on
to
say
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
a
-
going
,
Davy
,
you
see
,
to
my
brother
's
,
first
,
for
another
fortnight
's
visit
---
just
till
I
have
have
time
to
look
about
me
,
and
get
to
be
something
like
myself
again
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
I
have
be
think
that
perhaps
,
as
they
do
not
want
you
here
at
present
,
you
may
be
let
to
go
along
with
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
if
anything
,
short
of
be
in
a
different
relation
to
every
one
about
me
,
Peggotty
except
,
could
have
give
me
a
sense
of
pleasure
at
that
time
,
it
would
have
be
this
project
of
all
other
.
 
<EOS>
the
idea
of
be
again
surround
by
those
honest
face
,
shine
welcome
on
me
;
of
renew
the
peacefulness
of
the
sweet
Sunday
morning
,
when
the
bell
be
ring
,
the
stone
drop
in
the
water
,
and
the
shadowy
ship
break
through
the
mist
;
of
roam
up
and
down
with
little
em'ly
,
tell
her
my
trouble
,
and
find
charm
against
them
in
the
shell
and
pebble
on
the
beach
;
make
a
calm
in
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
ruffle
next
moment
,
to
be
sure
,
by
a
doubt
of
Miss
Murdstone
's
give
her
consent
;
but
even
that
be
set
at
rest
soon
,
for
she
come
out
to
take
an
evening
grope
in
the
store
-
closet
while
we
be
yet
in
conversation
,
and
Peggotty
,
with
a
boldness
that
amaze
me
,
broach
the
topic
on
the
spot
.
   
<EOS>
"
the
boy
will
be
idle
there
,
"
say
Miss
Murdstone
,
look
into
a
pickle
-
jar
,
"
and
idleness
be
the
root
of
all
evil
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
to
be
sure
,
he
would
be
idle
here
---
or
anywhere
,
in
my
opinion
.
"
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
have
an
angry
answer
ready
,
I
could
see
;
but
she
swallow
it
for
my
sake
,
and
remain
silent
.
   
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
<EOS>
"
say
Miss
Murdstone
,
still
keep
her
eye
on
the
pickle
;
"
it
be
of
more
importance
than
anything
else
---
it
be
of
paramount
importance
---
that
my
brother
should
not
be
disturb
or
make
uncomfortable
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
have
better
say
yes
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
thank
her
,
without
make
any
demonstration
of
joy
,
lest
it
should
induce
her
to
withdraw
her
assent
.
 
<EOS>
nor
could
I
help
think
this
a
prudent
course
,
since
she
look
at
me
out
of
the
pickle
-
jar
,
with
as
great
an
access
of
sourness
as
if
her
black
eye
have
absorb
its
content
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
the
permission
be
give
,
and
be
never
retract
;
for
when
the
month
be
out
,
Peggotty
and
I
be
ready
to
depart
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Barkis
come
into
the
house
for
Peggotty
's
box
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
know
him
to
pass
the
garden
-
gate
before
,
but
on
this
occasion
he
come
into
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
give
me
a
look
as
he
shoulder
the
large
box
and
go
out
,
which
I
think
have
meaning
in
it
,
if
meaning
could
ever
be
say
to
find
its
way
into
Mr
Barkis
's
visage
.
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
be
naturally
in
low
spirit
at
leave
what
have
be
her
home
<EOS>
so
many
year
,
and
where
the
two
strong
attachment
of
her
life
---
for
my
mother
and
myself
---
have
be
form
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
walk
in
the
churchyard
,
too
,
very
early
;
and
she
get
into
the
cart
,
and
sit
in
it
with
her
handkerchief
at
her
eye
.
   
<EOS>
so
long
as
she
remain
in
this
condition
,
Mr
Barkis
give
no
sign
of
life
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
He
sit
in
his
usual
place
and
attitude
like
a
great
stuff
figure
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
she
begin
to
look
about
her
,
and
to
speak
to
me
,
he
nod
his
head
and
grin
several
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
least
notion
at
whom
,
or
what
he
mean
by
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
beautiful
day
,
Mr
Barkis
!
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
as
an
act
of
politeness
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
bad
,
"
say
Mr
Barkis
,
who
generally
qualify
his
speech
,
and
rarely
commit
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Peggotty
be
quite
comfortable
now
,
Mr
Barkis
,
"
I
remark
,
for
his
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
she
,
though
?
"
say
Mr
Barkis
.
   
<EOS>
after
reflect
about
it
,
with
a
sagacious
air
,
Mr
Barkis
eye
her
,
and
say
:
   
"
are
you
pretty
comfortable
?
"
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
laugh
,
and
answer
in
the
affirmative
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
really
and
truly
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
be
you
?
"
<EOS>
growl
Mr
Barkis
,
slide
nearer
to
her
on
the
seat
,
and
nudge
her
with
his
elbow
.
<EOS>
"
be
you
?
 
<EOS>
really
and
truly
pretty
comfortable
?
 
<EOS>
be
you
?
 
<EOS>
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
at
each
of
these
inquiry
Mr
Barkis
shuffle
nearer
to
her
,
and
give
her
another
nudge
;
so
that
at
last
we
be
all
crowd
together
in
the
left
-
hand
corner
of
the
cart
,
and
<EOS>
I
be
so
squeezed
that
I
could
hardly
bear
it
.
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
call
his
attention
to
my
suffering
,
Mr
Barkis
give
me
a
little
more
room
at
once
,
and
get
away
by
degree
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
help
observe
that
he
seem
to
think
he
have
hit
upon
a
wonderful
expedient
for
express
himself
in
a
neat
,
agreeable
,
and
pointed
manner
,
without
the
inconvenience
of
invent
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
He
manifestly
chuckle
over
it
for
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
by
and
<EOS>
by
he
turn
to
Peggotty
again
,
and
repeat
,
"
be
you
pretty
comfortable
though
?
"
<EOS>
bore
down
upon
us
as
before
,
until
the
breath
be
nearly
edge
out
of
my
body
.
 
<EOS>
by
and
by
he
make
another
descent
upon
us
with
the
same
inquiry
,
and
the
same
result
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
I
get
up
whenever
I
see
him
come
,
and
stand
on
the
foot
-
board
,
pretend
to
look
at
the
prospect
;
after
which
I
do
very
well
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
so
polite
as
to
stop
at
a
public
-
house
,
expressly
on
our
account
,
and
entertain
us
with
broil
mutton
and
beer
.
 
<EOS>
even
when
Peggotty
be
in
the
act
of
drinking
,
he
be
seize
with
one
of
those
approach
,
and
almost
choke
her
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
we
draw
near
to
the
end
of
our
journey
,
he
have
more
to
do
and
less
time
for
gallantry
;
and
when
we
get
on
Yarmouth
pavement
,
we
be
all
too
much
shaken
and
jolt
,
I
apprehend
,
to
have
any
leisure
for
anything
else
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
and
Ham
wait
for
us
at
the
old
place
.
 
<EOS>
They
receive
me
and
Peggotty
in
an
affectionate
manner
,
and
shake
hand
with
Mr
Barkis
,
who
,
with
his
hat
on
the
very
back
of
his
head
,
and
a
shame
-
face
leer
upon
his
countenance
,
and
pervade
his
very
leg
,
present
but
a
vacant
appearance
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
They
each
take
one
of
Peggotty
's
trunk
,
and
we
be
go
away
,
when
Mr
Barkis
solemnly
make
a
sign
to
me
with
his
forefinger
to
come
under
an
archway
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
growl
Mr
Barkis
,
"
it
be
all
right
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
look
up
into
his
face
,
and
answer
,
with
an
attempt
to
be
very
profound
:
"
oh
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
do
not
come
to
a
end
there
,
"
say
Mr
Barkis
,
nod
confidentially
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
right
.
"
   
<EOS>
again
I
answer
,
"
oh
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
who
be
willin
'
,
"
say
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
Barkis
,
and
Barkis
only
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
nod
assent
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
right
,
"
say
Mr
Barkis
,
shake
hand
;
"
I
be
a
friend
of
your'n
.
 
<EOS>
You
make
it
all
right
,
first
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
all
right
.
"
   
<EOS>
in
his
attempt
to
be
particularly
lucid
,
Mr
Barkis
be
so
extremely
mysterious
,
that
I
may
have
stand
look
in
his
face
for
an
hour
,
and
most
assuredly
should
have
get
as
much
information
out
of
it
as
out
of
the
face
of
a
clock
that
have
stop
,
but
for
Peggotty
's
call
me
away
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
be
go
along
,
she
ask
me
what
he
have
say
;
and
I
tell
her
he
have
say
it
be
all
right
.
   
<EOS>
"
like
his
impudence
,
"
say
Peggotty
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
mind
that
!
 
<EOS>
Davy
dear
,
what
should
you
think
if
I
be
to
think
of
be
marry
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
---
I
suppose
you
would
like
me
as
much
then
,
Peggotty
,
as
you
do
now
?
<EOS>
"
I
return
,
after
a
little
consideration
.
   
<EOS>
greatly
to
the
astonishment
of
the
passenger
in
the
street
,
as
well
as
of
her
relation
go
on
before
,
the
good
soul
be
oblige
to
stop
and
embrace
me
on
the
spot
,
with
many
protestation
of
her
unalterable
love
.
   
<EOS>
"
tell
me
what
should
you
say
,
darle
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
again
,
when
this
be
over
,
and
we
be
walk
on
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
you
be
think
of
be
marry
---
to
Mr
Barkis
,
Peggotty
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
.
 
<EOS>
for
then
you
know
,
Peggotty
,
you
would
always
have
the
horse
and
cart

Peggotty

<EOS>
"
what
I
have
be
think
of
,
this
month
back
!
 
<EOS>
yes
,
my
precious
;
and
I
think
I
should
be
more
independent
altogether
<EOS>
,
you
see
;
let
alone
my
working
with
a
well
heart
in
my
own
house
,
than
I
could
in
anybody
else
be
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
I
may
be
fit
for
,
now
,
as
a
servant
to
a
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
shall
be
always
near
my
pretty
's
resting
-
place
,
"
say
Peggotty
,
musing
,
"
and
be
able
to
see
it
when
I
like
;
and
when
I
lie
down
to
rest
,
I
may
be
lay
not
far
off
from
my
darling
girl
!
"
   
<EOS>
We
neither
of
us
say
anything
for
a
little
while
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
I
would
not
so
much
as
give
it
another
thought
,
"
say
Peggotty
,
cheerily
"
if
my
Davy
be
anyways
against
it
---
not
if
I
have
be
ask
in
church
thirty
time
three
time
over
,
and
be
wear
out
the
ring
in
my
pocket

"
   
<EOS>
"
look
at
me
,
Peggotty

"
I
reply
;
"
and
see
if
I
be
not
really
glad
,
and
do
not
truly
wish
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
as
indeed
I
do
,
with
all
my
heart
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
life
,
"
say
Peggotty
,
give
me
a
squeeze
,
"
I
have
think
of
it
night
and
day
,
every
way
I
can
,
and
I
hope
the
right
way
;
but
I
will
think
of
it
again
,
and
speak
to
my
brother
about
it
,
and
in
the
meantime
we
will
keep
it
to
ourselves
,
Davy
,
you
and
me
.
<EOS>
Barkis
be
a
good
plain
creature
,
"
say
Peggotty
,
"
and
if
I
try
to
do
my
duty
by
him
,
I
think
it
would
be
my
fault
if
I
be
not
---
if
I
be
not
pretty
comfortable
,
"
say
Peggotty
,
laugh
heartily
.
<EOS>
this
quotation
from
Mr
Barkis
be
so
appropriate
,
and
tickle
us
both
so
much
,
that
we
laugh
again
and
again
,
and
be
quite
in
a
pleasant
humour
when
we
come
within
view
of
Mr
Peggotty
's
cottage
.
   
<EOS>
It
look
just
the
same
,
except
that
it
may
,
perhaps
,
have
shrink
a
little
in
my
eye
;
and
Mrs
Gummidge
be
wait
at
the
door
as
if
she
have
stand
there
ever
since
.
 
<EOS>
all
within
be
the
same
,
down
to
the
seaweed
in
the
blue
mug
in
my
bedroom
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
into
the
out
-
house
to
look
about
me
;
and
the
very
same
lobster
,
crab
,
and
crawfish
possess
by
the
same
desire
to
pinch
the
world
in
general
,
appear
to
be
in
the
same
state
of
conglomeration
in
the
   
same
old
corner
.
   
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
little
em'ly
to
be
see
,
so
I
ask
Mr
Peggotty
where
she
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
be
at
school
,
sir
,
"
say
Mr
Peggotty
,
wipe
the
heat
consequent
on
the
porterage
of
Peggotty
's
box
from
his
forehead
;
"
she
will
be
home
,
"
look
at
the
dutch
clock
,
"
in
from
twenty
minute
to
half
-
an
-
hour
's
time
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
on
us
feel
the
loss
of
her
,
bless
ye
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
moan
.
   
<EOS>
"
cheer
up
,
Mawther
!
"
cry
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
feel
it
more
than
anybody
else
,
"
say
Mrs
Gummidge
;
<EOS>
"
I
be
a
lone
lorn
creetur
'
,
and
she
use
to
be
a'most
the
only
thing
that
do
not
go
contrary
with
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
,
whimper
and
shake
her
head
,
apply
herself
to
blow
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
,
look
round
upon
us
while
she
be
so
engaged
,
say
in
a
low
voice
,
which
he
shade
with
his
hand
:
"
the
old
'
un
!
"
 
<EOS>
from
this
I
rightly
conjecture
that
no
improvement
have
take
place
since
my
last
visit
in
the
state
of
Mrs
Gummidge
's
spirit
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
the
whole
place
be
,
or
it
should
have
be
,
quite
as
delightful
a
place
as
ever
;
and
yet
it
do
not
impress
me
in
the
same
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
rather
disappointed
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
because
little
em'ly
be
not
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
way
by
which
she
would
come
,
and
presently
find
myself
stroll
along
the
path
to
meet
her
.
   
<EOS>
a
figure
appear
in
the
distance
before
long
,
and
I
soon
know
it
to
be
Em'ly
,
who
be
a
little
creature
still
in
stature
,
though
she
be
grow
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
she
draw
near
,
and
I
see
her
blue
eye
look
bluer
,
and
her
dimpled
face
look
bright
,
and
her
whole
self
prettier
and
gayer
,
a
curious
feeling
come
over
me
that
make
me
pretend
not
to
know
her
,
and
pass
by
as
if
I
be
look
at
something
a
long
way
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
do
such
a
thing
since
in
later
life
,
or
I
be
mistaken
.
   
<EOS>
little
Em'ly
do
not
care
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
She
see
me
well
enough
;
but
instead
of
turn
round
and
call
after
me
,
run
away
laugh
.
<EOS>
this
oblige
me
to
run
after
her
,
and
she
run
so
fast
that
we
be
very
near
the
cottage
before
I
catch
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
it
be
you
,
be
it
?
"
say
little
Em'ly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
why
,
you
know
who
it
be
,
Em'ly
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
and
do
not
you
know
who
it
be
?
"
say
Em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
kiss
her
,
but
she
cover
her
cherry
lip
with
her
hand
,
and
say
she
be
not
a
baby
now
,
and
run
away
,
laugh
more
than
ever
,
into
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
She
seem
to
delight
in
tease
me
,
which
be
a
change
in
her
<EOS>
I
wonder
at
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
the
tea
table
be
ready
,
and
our
little
locker
be
put
out
in
its
old
place
,
but
instead
of
come
to
sit
by
me
,
she
go
and
bestow
her
company
upon
that
grumble
Mrs
Gummidge
:
and
on
Mr
Peggotty
's
inquire
<EOS>
why
,
rumple
her
hair
all
over
her
face
to
hide
it
,
and
could
do
nothing
but
laugh
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
little
puss
,
it
be
!
"
say
Mr
Peggotty
,
pat
her
with
his
great
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
so
sh
'
be
!
 
<EOS>
so
sh

<EOS>
cry
Ham
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mas'r
Davy

so
sh

"
<EOS>
and
he
sit
and
chuckle
at
her
for
some
time
,
in
a
state
of
mingle
admiration
and
delight
<EOS>
,
that
make
his
face
a
burn
red
.
   
<EOS>
little
Em'ly
be
spoil
by
them
all
,
in
fact
;
and
by
no
one
more
than
Mr
Peggotty
himself
,
whom
she
could
have
coax
into
anything
,
by
only
go
and
lay
her
cheek
against
his
rough
whisker
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
my
opinion
,
at
least
,
when
I
see
her
do
it
;
and
I
hold
Mr
Peggotty
to
be
thoroughly
in
the
right
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
so
affectionate
and
sweet
-
natured
,
and
have
such
a
pleasant
manner
of
be
both
sly
and
shy
at
once
,
that
she
captivate
me
more
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
She
be
tender
-
hearted
,
too
;
for
when
,
as
we
sit
round
the
fire
after
tea
,
an
allusion
be
make
by
Mr
Peggotty
over
his
pipe
to
the
loss
I
have
sustain
,
the
tear
stand
in
her
eye
,
and
she
look
at
me
so
kindly
across
the
table
,
that
I
feel
quite
thankful
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
say
Mr
Peggotty
,
take
up
her
curl
,
and
run
them
over
his
hand
like
water
,
"

<EOS>

<EOS>
if
I
have
you
for
my
guardian

I

I

Mr

look
at
me
through
the
smoke

Mr

nothing

I.

He
know
a

look
at

He
be
the
good
cricketer

He
will
give
you
almost
as
many
man
as
you
like
at
draught

beat
you
easily

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
give
his
head
another
toss
,
as
much
as
to
say
:
"
of
course
he
will
.

<EOS>

He
be
such
a
speaker
,

I
pursue
,
"
that
he
can
win
anybody
over

I
do
not
know
what
you
would
say
if
you
be
to
hear
him
sing

Mr
Peggotty

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
give
his
head
another
toss
,
as
much
as
to
say
:
"
I
have
no
doubt
of
it

<EOS>
"
then
,
he
be
such
a
generous
,
fine
,
noble
fellow
,
"
say
I
,
quite
carry
away
by
my
favourite
theme
,
"
that
it
be
hardly
possible
to
give
him
as
much
praise
as
he
deserve
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
can
never
feel
thankful
enough
for
the
generosity
with
which
he
have
protect
me
,
so
much
young
and
low
in
the
school
than
himself
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
run
on
,
very
fast
indeed
,
when
my
eye
rest
on
little
em'ly
's
face
,
which
be
bent
forward
over
the
table
,
listen
with
the
deep
attention
,
her
breath
hold
,
her
blue
eye
sparkle
like
jewel
,
and
the
colour
mantle
in
her
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
She
look
so
extraordinarily
earnest
and
pretty
,
that
I
stop
in
a
sort
of
wonder
;
and
they
all
observe
her
at
the
same
time
,
for
as
I
stop
,
they
laugh
and
look
at
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
em'ly
be
like
me
,
"
say
Peggotty
,
"
and
would
like
to
see
him

"
   
<EOS>
Em'ly
be
confuse
by
our
all
observe
her
,
and
hang
down
her
head
,
and
her
face
be
cover
with
blush
.
 
<EOS>
glance
up
presently
through
her
stray
curl
,
and
see
that
we
be
all
look
at
her
still
<EOS>
(
I
be
sure
I
,
for
one
,
could
have
look
at
her
for
hour
)
,
she
run
away
,
and
keep
away
till
it
be
nearly
bedtime
.
   
<EOS>
I
lie
down
in
the
old
little
bed
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
,
and
the
wind
come
moan
on
across
the
flat
as
it
have
do
before
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
help
fancy
,
now
,
that
it
moan
of
those
who
be
go
;
and
instead
of
think
that
the
sea
may
rise
in
the
night
and
float
the
boat
away
,
I
think
of
the
sea
that
have
rise
,
since
I
last
hear
those
sound
,
and
drown
my
happy
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
recollect
,
as
the
wind
and
water
begin
to
sound
fainter
in
my
ear
,
put
a
short
clause
into
my
prayer
,
petition
that
I
may
grow
up
to
marry
little
em'ly
,
and
so
drop
lovingly
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
the
day
pass
pretty
much
as
they
have
pass
before
,
except
---
it
be
a
great
exception
---
<EOS>
that
little
Em'ly
and
I
seldom
wander
on
the
beach
now
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
task
to
learn
,
and
needle
-
work
to
do
;
and
be
absent
during
a
great
part
of
each
day
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
feel
that
we
should
not
have
have
those
old
wandering
,
even
if
it
have
be
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
wild
and
full
of
childish
whim
as
Em'ly
be
<EOS>
,
she
be
more
of
a
little
woman
than
I
have
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
She
seem
to
have
get
a
great
distance
away
from
me
,
in
little
more
than
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
She
like
me
,
but
she
laugh
at
me
,
and
torment
me
;
and
when
I
go
to
meet
her
,
steal
home
another
way
,
and
be
laugh
at
the
door
when
I
come
back
,
disappointed
.
 
<EOS>
the
good
time
be
when
she
sit
quietly
at
work
in
the
doorway
,
and
I
sit
on
the
wooden
step
at
her
foot
,
read
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
,
at
this
hour
,
that
I
have
never
see
such
sunlight
as
on
those
bright
April
afternoon
;
that
I
have
never
see
such
a
sunny
little
figure
as
I
use
to
see
,
sit
in
the
doorway
of
the
old
boat
;
that
I
have
never
behold
such
sky
,
such
water
,
such
glorified
ship
sail
away
into
golden
air
.
   
<EOS>
on
the
very
first
evening
after
our
arrival
,
Mr
Barkis
appear
in
an
exceedingly
vacant
and
awkward
condition
,
and
with
a
bundle
of
orange
tie
up
in
a
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
make
no
allusion
of
any
kind
to
this
property
,
he
be
suppose
to
have
leave
it
behind
him
by
accident
when
he
go
away
;
until
Ham
,
run
after
him
to
restore
it
,
come
back
with
the
information
that
it
be
intend
for
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
after
that
occasion
he
appear
every
evening
at
exactly
the
same
hour
,
and
always
with
a
little
bundle
,
to
which
he
never
allude
,
and
which
he
regularly
put
behind
the
door
and
leave
there
.
<EOS>
these
offering
of
affection
be
of
a
most
various
and
eccentric
description
.
 
<EOS>
among
them
I
remember
a
double
set
of
pig
'
trotter
,
a
huge
pin
-
cushion
,
half
a
bushel
or
so
of
apple
,
a
pair
of
jet
earring
,
some
spanish
onion
,
a
box
of
domino
,
a
canary
bird
and
cage
,
and
a
leg
of
pickle
pork
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Barkis
's
wooing
,
as
I
remember
it
,
be
altogether
of
a
peculiar
kind
.
 
<EOS>
He
very
seldom
say
anything
;
but
would
sit
by
the
fire
in
much
the
same
attitude
as
he
sit
in
his
cart
,
and
stare
heavily
at
Peggotty
,
who
be
opposite
.
 
<EOS>
one
night
,
be
,
as
I
suppose
,
inspire
by
love
,
he
make
a
dart
at
the
bit
of
wax
-
candle
<EOS>
she
keep
for
her
thread
,
and
put
it
in
his
waistcoat
-
pocket
and
carry
it
off
.
 
<EOS>
after
that
,
his
great
delight
be
to
produce
it
when
it
be
want
,
stick
to
the
lining
of
his
pocket
,
in
a
partially
melt
state
,
and
pocket
it
again
when
it
be
do
with
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
to
enjoy
himself
very
much
,
and
not
to
feel
at
all
call
upon
to
talk
.
 
<EOS>
even
when
he
take
Peggotty
out
for
a
walk
on
the
flat
,
he
have
no
uneasiness
on
that
head
,
I
believe
;
content
himself
with
now
and
then
ask
her
if
she
be
pretty
comfortable
;
and
I
remember
that
sometimes
,
after
he
be
go
,
Peggotty
would
throw
her
apron
over
her
face
,
and
laugh
for
half
-
an
-
hour
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
we
be
all
more
or
less
amused
,
except
that
miserable
Mrs
Gummidge
,
whose
courtship
would
appear
to
have
be
of
an
exactly
parallel
nature
,
she
be
so
continually
remind
by
these
transaction
of
the
old
one
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
,
when
the
term
of
my
visit
be
nearly
expire
,
it
be
give
out
that
Peggotty
and
Mr
Barkis
be
go
to
make
a
day
's
holiday
together
,
and
that
little
em'ly
<EOS>
and
I
be
to
accompany
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
but
<EOS>
a
broken
sleep
the
night
before
,
in
anticipation
of
the
pleasure
of
a
whole
day
with
Em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
all
astir
betime
in
the
morning
;
and
while
we
be
yet
at
breakfast
,
Mr
Barkis
appear
in
the
distance
,
drive
a
chaise
-
cart
towards
the
object
of
his
affection
.
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
be
dress
as
usual
,
in
her
neat
and
quiet
mourning
;
but
Mr
Barkis
bloom
in
a
new
blue
coat
,
of
which
the
tailor
have
give
him
such
good
measure
,
that
the
cuff
would
have
render
glove
unnecessary
in
the
cold
weather
,
while
the
collar
be
so
high
that
it
push
his
hair
up
on
end
on
the
top
of
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
His
bright
button
,
too
,
be
of
the
large
size
.
 
<EOS>
rendered
complete
by
drab
pantaloon
and
a
buff
waistcoat
<EOS>
,
I
think
Mr
Barkis
a
phenomenon
of
respectability
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
be
all
in
a
bustle
outside
the
door
,
I
find
that
Mr
Peggotty
be
prepare
with
an
old
shoe
,
which
be
to
be
throw
after
us
for
luck
,
and
which
he
offer
to
Mrs
Gummidge
for
that
purpose
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
better
be
do
by
somebody
else
,
Dan'l
,
"
say
Mrs
Gummidge
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
a
lone
lorn
creetur
'
myself
,
and
everythink
that
remind
me
of
creetur
's
that
be
not
lone
and
lorn
,
go
contrary
with
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
come
,
old
gal
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
take
and
heave
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
Dan'l
,
"
return
Mrs
Gummidge
,
whimper
and
shake
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
I
feel
less
,
I
could
do
more
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
not
feel
like
me
,
Dan'l
;
think
do
not
go
contrary
with
you
,
nor
you
with
them
;
you
have
better
do
it
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
but
here
Peggotty
,
who
have
be
go
about
from
one
to
another
in
a
hurried
way
,
kiss
everybody
,
call
out
from
the
cart
,
in
which
we
all
be
by
this
time
<EOS>
(
Em'ly
and
I
on
two
little
chair
,
side
by
side
)
,
that
Mrs
Gummidge
must
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
so
Mrs
Gummidge
do
it
;
and
,
I
be
sorry
to
relate
,
cast
a
damp
upon
the
festive
character
of
our
departure
,
by
immediately
burst
into
tear
,
and
sink
subdue
into
the
arm
of
Ham
,
with
the
declaration
that
she
know
she
be
a
burden
,
and
have
better
be
carry
to
the
House
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
which
I
really
think
be
a
sensible
idea
,
that
Ham
may
have
act
on
.
   
<EOS>
away
we
go
,
however
,
on
our
holiday
excursion
;
and
the
first
thing
we
do
be
to
stop
at
a
church
,
where
Mr
Barkis
tie
the
horse
to
some
rail
,
and
go
in
with
Peggotty
,
leave
little
em'ly
and
me
alone
in
the
chaise
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
that
occasion
to
put
my
arm
round
Em'ly
's
waist
,
and
propose
that
as
I
be
go
away
so
very
soon
now
,
we
should
determine
to
be
very
affectionate
to
one
another
,
and
very
happy
,
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
little
Em'ly
consenting
,
and
allow
me
to
kiss
her
<EOS>
,
I
become
desperate
;
inform
her
,
I
recollect
,
that
I
never
could
love
another
,
and
that
I
be
prepared
to
shed
the
blood
of
anybody
who
should
aspire
to
her
affection
.
   
<EOS>
how
merry
little
Em'ly
make
herself
about
it
!
 
<EOS>
with
what
a
demure
assumption
of
be
immensely
old
and
wise
than
I
,
the
fairy
little
woman
say
I
be
"
a
silly
boy
"
;
and
then
laugh
so
charmingly
that
I
forget
the
pain
of
be
call
by
that
disparaging
name
,
in
the
pleasure
of
look
at
her
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Barkis
and
Peggotty
be
a
good
while
in
the
church
,
but
come
out
at
last
,
and
then
we
drive
away
into
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
be
go
along
,
Mr
Barkis
turn
to
me
,
and
say
,
with
a
wink
,
---
by
the
by
,
I
should
hardly
have
think
,
before
,
that
he
could
wink
:
   
"
what
name
be
it
as
I
write
up
in
the
cart
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Clara
Peggotty
,
<EOS>
"
I
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
name
would
it
be
as
I
should
write
up
now
,
if
there
be
a
tilt
here
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Clara
Peggotty
,
again
?
<EOS>
"
I
suggest
.
   
<EOS>
"
Clara
Peggotty
BARKIS
!
"
<EOS>
he
return
,
and
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
that
shake
the
chaise
.
   
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
they
be
married
,
and
have
go
into
the
church
for
no
other
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
be
resolve
that
it
should
be
quietly
do
;
and
the
clerk
have
give
her
away
,
and
there
have
be
no
witness
of
the
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
little
confused
when
Mr
Barkis
make
this
abrupt
announcement
of
their
union
,
and
could
not
hug
me
enough
in
token
of
her
unimpaired
affection
;
but
she
soon
become
herself
again
,
and
say
she
be
very
glad
it
be
over
.
   
<EOS>
We
drive
to
a
little
inn
in
a
by
-
road
,
where
we
be
expect
,
and
where
we
have
a
very
comfortable
dinner
,
and
pass
the
day
with
great
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
if
Peggotty
have
be
marry
every
day
for
the
last
ten
year
,
she
could
hardly
have
be
more
at
her
ease
about
it
;
it
make
no
sort
of
difference
in
her
:
she
be
just
the
same
as
ever
,
and
go
out
for
a
stroll
with
little
em'ly
and
me
before
tea
,
while
Mr
Barkis
philosophically
smoke
his
pipe
,
and
enjoy
himself
,
I
suppose
,
with
the
contemplation
of
his
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
if
so
,
it
sharpen
his
appetite
;
for
I
distinctly
call
to
mind
that
,
although
he
have
eat
a
good
deal
of
pork
and
green
at
dinner
,
and
have
finish
off
with
a
fowl
or
two
,
he
be
oblige
to
have
cold
boil
bacon
for
tea
,
and
dispose
of
a
large
quantity
without
any
emotion
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
often
think
,
since
,
what
an
odd
,
innocent
,
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
kind
of
wedding
it
must
have
be
!
 
<EOS>
We
get
into
the
chaise
again
soon
after
dark
,
and
drive
cosily
back
,
look
up
at
the
star
,
and
talk
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
their
chief
exponent
,
and
open
Mr
Barkis
's
mind
to
an
amazing
extent
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
all
I
know
,
but
he
would
have
believe
anything
I
may
have
take
it
into
my
head
to
impart
to
him
;
for
he
have
a
profound
veneration
for
my
ability
,
and
inform
his
wife
in
my
hearing
,
on
that
very
occasion
,
that
I
be
"
a
young
Roeshus
"
---
by
which
I
think
he
mean
prodigy
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
have
exhaust
the
subject
of
the
star
,
or
rather
when
I
have
exhaust
the
mental
faculty
of
Mr
Barkis
,
little
em'ly
<EOS>
and
I
make
a
cloak
of
an
old
wrapper
,
and
sit
under
it
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
.
 
<EOS>
ah
,
how
I
love
her
!
 
<EOS>
what
happiness
(
I
think
)
if
we
be
married
,
and
be
go
away
anywhere
to
live
among
the
tree
and
<EOS>
in
the
field
,
never
grow
old
,
never
grow
wise
,
child
ever
,
ramble
hand
in
hand
through
sunshine
and
among
flowery
meadow
,
lay
down
our
head
on
moss
at
night
,
in
a
sweet
sleep
of
purity
and
peace
,
and
bury
by
the
bird
when
we
be
dead
!
 
<EOS>
some
such
picture
,
with
no
real
world
in
it
,
bright
with
the
light
of
our
innocence
,
and
vague
as
the
star
afar
off
,
be
in
my
mind
all
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
think
there
be
two
such
guileless
heart
at
Peggotty
's
marriage
as
little
em'ly
's
and
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
think
the
Loves
and
Graces
take
such
airy
form
in
its
homely
procession
.
   
<EOS>
well
,
we
come
to
the
old
boat
again
in
good
time
at
night
;
and
there
Mr
and
Mrs
Barkis
bid
us
good
-
bye
,
and
drive
away
snugly
to
their
own
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
I
have
lose
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
go
to
bed
with
a
sore
heart
indeed
under
any
other
roof
but
that
which
shelter
little
Em'ly
's
head
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
and
Ham
know
what
be
in
my
thought
as
well
as
I
do
,
and
be
ready
with
some
supper
and
their
hospitable
face
to
drive
it
away
.
 
<EOS>
little
Em'ly
come
and
sit
beside
me
on
the
locker
for
the
only
time
in
all
that
visit
;
and
it
be
altogether
a
wonderful
close
to
a
wonderful
day
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
night
tide
;
and
soon
after
we
go
to
bed
,
Mr
Peggotty
and
Ham
go
out
to
fish
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
very
brave
at
be
leave
alone
in
the
solitary
house
,
the
protector
of
Em'ly
and
Mrs
Gummidge
,
and
only
wish
that
a
lion
or
a
serpent
,
or
any
ill
-
dispose
monster
,
would
make
an
attack
upon
us
,
that
I
may
destroy
him
,
and
cover
myself
with
glory
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
nothing
of
the
sort
happen
to
be
walk
about
on
Yarmouth
flat
that
night
,
I
provide
the
good
substitute
I
could
by
dream
of
dragon
until
morning
.
   
<EOS>
with
morning
come
Peggotty
;
who
call
to
me
,
as
usual
,
under
my
window
as
if
Mr
Barkis
the
carrier
have
be
from
first
to
last
a
dream
too
.
 
<EOS>
after
breakfast
she
take
me
to
her
own
home
,
and
a
beautiful
little
home
<EOS>
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
of
all
the
moveable
in
it
,
I
must
have
be
impress
by
a
certain
old
bureau
of
some
dark
wood
in
the
parlour
<EOS>
(
the
tile
-
floor
kitchen
be
the
general
sit
-
room
)
,
with
a
retreat
top
which
open
,
let
down
,
and
become
a
desk
,
within
which
be
a
large
quarto
edition
of
Foxe
's
Book
of
Martyrs
.
 
<EOS>
this
precious
volume
,
of
which
I
do
not
recollect
one
word
<EOS>
,
I
immediately
discover
and
immediately
apply
myself
to
;
and
I
never
visit
the
house
afterwards
,
but
I
kneel
on
a
chair
,
open
the
casket
where
this
gem
be
enshrine
,
spread
my
arm
over
the
desk
,
and
fall
to
devour
the
book
afresh
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
chiefly
edify
,
I
be
afraid
,
by
the
picture
,
which
be
numerous
,
and
represent
all
kind
of
dismal
horror
;
but
the
Martyrs
and
Peggotty
's
house
have
be
inseparable
in
my
mind
ever
since
,
and
be
now
.
   
<EOS>
I
take
leave
of
Mr
Peggotty
,
and
Ham
,
and
Mrs
Gummidge
,
and
little
em'ly
,
that
day
;
and
pass
the
night
at
Peggotty
's
,
in
a
little
room
in
the
roof
(
with
the
Crocodile
Book
on
a
shelf
by
the
bed
's
head
)
which
be
to
be
always
mine
,
Peggotty
say
,
and
should
always
be
keep
for
me
in
exactly
the
same
state
.
   
<EOS>
"
young
or
old
,
Davy
dear
,
as
long
as
I
be
alive
and
have
this
house
over
my
head
,
"
say
Peggotty
,
"
you
shall
find
it
as
if
I
expect
you
here
directly
minute
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
keep
it
every
day
,
as
I
use
to
keep
your
old
little
room
,
my
darling
;
and
if
you
be
to
go
to
China
,
you
may
think
of
it
as
be
keep
just
the
same
,
all
the
time
you
be
away
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
feel
the
truth
and
constancy
of
my
dear
old
nurse
,
with
all
my
heart
,
and
thank
her
as
well
as
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
not
very
well
,
for
she
speak
to
me
thus
,
with
her
arm
round
my
neck
,
in
the
morning
,
and
I
be
go
home
in
the
morning
,
and
I
go
home
in
the
morning
,
with
herself
and
Mr
Barkis
in
the
cart
.
 
<EOS>
They
leave
me
at
the
gate
,
not
easily
or
lightly
;
and
it
be
a
strange
sight
to
me
to
see
the
cart
go
on
,
take
Peggotty
away
,
and
leave
me
under
the
old
elm
-
tree
look
at
the
house
,
in
which
there
be
no
face
to
look
on
mine
with
love
or
like
any
more
.
   
<EOS>
and
now
I
fall
into
a
state
of
neglect
,
which
I
can
not
look
back
upon
without
compassion
.
 
<EOS>
I
fall
at
once
into
a
solitary
condition
,
---
apart
from
all
friendly
notice
,
apart
from
the
society
of
all
other
boy
of
my
own
age
,
apart
from
all
companionship
but
my
own
spiritless
thought
,
---
which
seem
to
cast
its
gloom
upon
this
paper
as
I
write
.
   
<EOS>
what
would
I
have
give
,
to
have
be
send
to
the
hard
school
that
ever
be
keep
!
---
<EOS>
to
have
be
teach
something
,
anyhow
,
anywhere
!
 
<EOS>
no
such
hope
dawn
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
dislike
me
;
and
they
sullenly
,
sternly
,
steadily
,
overlook
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
Mr
Murdstone
's
mean
be
straiten
at
about
this
time
;
but
it
be
little
to
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
bear
me
;
and
in
put
me
from
him
he
try
,
as
I
believe
,
to
put
away
the
notion
that
I
have
any
claim
upon
him
---
and
succeed
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
not
actively
ill
-
use
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
beat
,
or
starve
;
but
the
wrong
that
be
do
to
me
have
no
interval
of
relent
,
and
be
do
in
a
systematic
,
passionless
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Day
after
day
,
week
after
week
,
month
after
month
,
I
be
coldly
neglect
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
sometimes
,
when
I
think
of
it
,
what
they
would
have
do
if
I
have
be
take
with
an
illness
;
whether
I
should
have
lain
down
in
my
lonely
room
,
and
languish
through
it
in
my
usual
solitary
way
,
or
whether
anybody
would
have
help
me
out
.
   
<EOS>
when
Mr
and
Miss
Murdstone
be
at
home
,
I
take
my
meal
with
them
;
in
their
absence
,
I
eat
and
drink
by
myself
.
 
<EOS>
at
all
time
I
lounge
about
the
house
and
neighbourhood
quite
disregard
,
except
that
they
be
jealous
of
my
make
any
friend
:
thinking
,
perhaps
,
that
if
I
do
,
I
may
complain
to
someone
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
reason
,
though
Mr
Chillip
often
ask
me
to
go
and
see
him
<EOS>
(
he
be
a
widower
,
have
,
<EOS>
some
year
before
that
,
lose
a
little
small
light
-
haired
wife
,
whom
I
can
just
remember
connect
in
my
own
thought
with
a
pale
tortoise
-
shell
cat
)
,
it
be
but
seldom
that
I
enjoy
the
happiness
of
pass
an
afternoon
in
his
closet
of
a
surgery
;
read
some
book
that
be
new
to
me
,
with
the
smell
of
the
whole
Pharmacopoeia
come
up
my
nose
,
or
pound
something
in
a
mortar
under
his
mild
direction
.
   
<EOS>
for
the
same
reason
,
add
no
doubt
to
the
old
dislike
of
her
,
I
be
seldom
allow
to
visit
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
faithful
to
her
promise
,
she
either
come
to
see
me
,
or
meet
me
somewhere
near
,
once
every
week
,
and
never
empty
-
handed
;
but
many
and
bitter
be
the
disappointment
I
have
,
in
be
refuse
permission
to
pay
a
visit
to
her
at
her
house
.
 
<EOS>
some
few
time
,
however
,
at
long
interval
,
I
be
allow
to
go
there
;
and
then
I
find
out
that
Mr
Barkis
be
something
of
a
miser
,
or
as
Peggotty
dutifully
express
it
,
be
"
a
little
near
"
,
and
keep
a
heap
of
money
in
a
box
under
his
bed
,
which
he
pretend
be
only
full
of
coat
and
trouser
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
coffer
,
his
rich
hide
themselves
with
such
a
tenacious
modesty
,
that
the
small
instalment
could
only
be
tempt
out
by
artifice
;
so
that
Peggotty
have
to
prepare
a
long
and
elaborate
scheme
,
a
very
Gunpowder
Plot
,
for
every
Saturday
's
expense
.
   
<EOS>
all
this
time
I
be
so
conscious
of
the
waste
of
any
promise
I
have
give
,
and
of
my
be
utterly
neglect
,
that
I
should
have
be
perfectly
miserable
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
but
for
the
old
book
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
my
only
comfort
;
and
I
be
as
true
to
them
as
they
be
to
me
,
and
read
them
over
and
over
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
many
time
more
.
   
<EOS>
I
now
approach
a
period
of
my
life
,
which
I
can
never
lose
the
remembrance
of
,
while
I
remember
anything
:
and
the
recollection
of
which
have
often
,
without
my
invocation
,
come
before
me
like
a
ghost
,
and
haunt
happy
time
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
be
out
,
one
day
,
loiter
somewhere
,
in
the
listless
,
meditative
manner
that
my
way
of
life
engender
,
<EOS>
when
,
turn
the
corner
of
a
lane
near
our
house
,
I
come
upon
Mr
Murdstone
walk
with
a
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
confused
,
and
be
go
by
them
,
when
the
gentleman
cry
:
   
<EOS>
"
what
!
 
<EOS>
Brooks
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
,
David
Copperfield
,
"
I
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
not
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
Brooks
,
"
say
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
Brooks
of
Sheffield
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
your
name
.
"
   
<EOS>
at
these
word
,
I
observe
the
gentleman
more
attentively
.
 
<EOS>
His
laugh
come
to
my
remembrance
too
,
I
know
him
to
be
Mr
Quinion
,
whom
I
have
go
over
to
Lowestoft
with
Mr
Murdstone
to
see
,
before
<EOS>
---
it
be
no
matter
---
I
need
not
recall
when
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
how
do
you
get
on
,
and
where
be
you
be
educate
,
Brooks
?
"
say
Mr
Quinion
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
put
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
,
and
turn
me
about
,
to
walk
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
to
reply
,
and
glance
dubiously
at
Mr
Murdstone
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
at
home
at
present
,
"
say
the
latter
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
not
be
educate
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
difficult
subject
.
"
   
<EOS>
that
old
,
double
look
be
on
me
for
a
moment
;
and
then
his
eye
darken
with
a
frown
,
as
it
turn
,
in
its
aversion
,
elsewhere
.
   
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
<EOS>
"
say
Mr
Quinion
,
look
at
us
both
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
"
fine
weather
!
"
   
<EOS>
silence
ensue
,
and
I
be
consider
how
I
could
best
disengage
my
shoulder
from
his
hand
,
and
go
away
,
when
he
say
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
be
a
pretty
sharp
fellow
still
?
 
<EOS>
eh
,
Brooks
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
aye
!
 
<EOS>
He
be
sharp
enough
,
"
say
Mr
Murdstone
,
impatiently
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
let
him
go
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
not
thank
you
for
trouble
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
on
this
hint
,
Mr
Quinion
release
me
,
and
I
make
the
good
of
my
way
home
.
 
<EOS>
look
back
as
I
turn
into
the
front
garden
,
I
see
Mr
Murdstone
lean
against
the
wicket
of
the
churchyard
,
and
Mr
Quinion
talk
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
both
look
after
me
,
and
I
feel
that
they
be
speak
of
me
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Quinion
lie
at
our
house
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
after
breakfast
,
the
next
morning
,
I
have
put
my
chair
away
,
and
be
go
out
of
the
room
,
when
Mr
Murdstone
call
me
back
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
gravely
repair
to
another
table
,
where
his
sister
sit
herself
at
her
desk
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Quinion
,
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
stand
look
out
of
window
;
and
I
stand
look
at
them
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
David
,
"
say
Mr
Murdstone
,
"
to
the
young
<EOS>
this
be
a

not
for

"
as
you
do

add
his
sister
.
   
<EOS>
"
Jane
Murdstone
,
leave
it
to
me
,
if
you
please

<EOS>
I
say
,
David
,
to
the
young
<EOS>
this
be
a
world
for
action
,
and
not
for
mope

droning
in

<EOS>
It
be
especially
so
for
a
young
boy
of
your
disposition
,
which
require
a
great
deal
of
correcting
;
and
to
which
no
great
service
can
be
do
than
to
force
it
to
conform

bend
it

break
it

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>

for
stubbornness

not

his

what
it

to

crush
it
must
be

<EOS>
Shall
be

too

<EOS>
He
give
her
a
look
,
half
in
remonstrance
,
half
in
approval
,
and
go
on
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
know

David

at

<EOS>
You

some
considerable

Education
be
costly

even
if
it
be
not

I
could
afford
it

I
be
of
opinion
that

<EOS>
I
think
it
occur
to
me
that
I
have
already
begin
it

in
my
poor
way

he

<EOS>
Mr

suggest
that

<EOS>
though
I
quite
understand
that
the

of
this
announcement
be
to
get
rid
of
me
,
I
have
no
distinct
remembrance
whether
it
please
or
frighten
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
impression
be
,
that
I
be
in
a
state
of
confusion
about
it
,
and
,
oscillate
between
the
two
point
,
touch
neither

<EOS>
nor
have
I
much
time
for
the
clearing
of
my
thought
,
as
Mr
Quinion
be
to
go
upon
the
morrow
.
   
<EOS>
Behold
me
,
on
the
morrow
,
in
a
much

wear
little
white
hat
,
with
a
black
crape
round
it
for
my
mother
,
a
black
jacket
,
and
a
pair
of
hard
,
stiff
corduroy
trouser
---
which
Miss
Murdstone
consider
the
good
armour
for
the
leg
in
that
fight
with
the
world
which
be
now
to
come
off
.
 
<EOS>
behold
me
so
attire
,
and
with
my
little
worldly
all
before
me
in
a
small
trunk
,
sit
,
a
lone
lorn
child
(
as
Mrs
Gummidge
may
have
say
)
,
in
the
post

chaise
that
be
carry
Mr

the
London
coach

Yarmouth

<EOS>
see
,
how
our
house

church
be
lessen
in
the
distance
;
how
the
grave
beneath
the
tree
be
blot
out
by

Chapter
11
.
<EOS>
I
begin
life
on
my
own
account
,
and
do
not
like
it
 
<EOS>
I
know
enough
of
the
world
now
,
to
have
almost
lose
the
capacity
of
be
much
surprised
by
anything
;
but
it
be
matter
of
some
surprise
to
me
,
even
now
,
that
I
can
have
be
so
easily
throw
away
at
such
an
age
.
 
<EOS>
a
child
of
excellent
ability
,
and
with
strong
power
of
observation
,
quick
,
eager
,
delicate
,
and
soon
hurt
bodily
or
mentally
<EOS>
,
it
seem
wonderful
to
me
that
nobody
should
have
make
any
sign
in
my
behalf
.
 
<EOS>
but
none
be
make
;
and
I
become
,
at
ten
year
old
,
a
little
labouring
hind
in
the
service
of
Murdstone
and
Grinby
.
   
<EOS>
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
warehouse
be
at
the
waterside
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
down
in
Blackfriars
.
 
<EOS>
modern
improvement
have
alter
the
place
;
but
it
be
the
last
house
at
the
bottom
of
a
narrow
street
,
curve
down
hill
to
the
river
,
with
some
stair
at
the
end
,
where
people
take
boat
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
crazy
old
house
with
a
wharf
of
its
own
,
abut
on
the
water
when
the
tide
be
in
,
and
on
the
mud
when
the
tide
be
out
,
and
literally
overrun
with
rat
.
 
<EOS>
Its
panelled
room
,
discolour
with
the
dirt
and
smoke
of
a
hundred
year
,
I
dare
say
;
its
decay
floor
and
staircase
;
the
squeak
and
scuffling
of
the
old
grey
rat
down
in
the
cellar
;
and
the
dirt
and
rottenness
of
the
place
;
be
thing
,
not
of
many
year
ago
,
in
my
mind
,
but
of
the
present
instant
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
all
before
me
,
just
as
they
be
in
the
evil
hour
when
I
go
among
them
for
the
first
time
,
with
my
tremble
hand
in
Mr
Quinion
's
.
   
<EOS>
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
trade
be
among
a
good
many
kind
of
people
,
but
an
important
branch
of
it
be
the
supply
of
wine
and
spirit
to
certain
packet
ship
.
 
<EOS>
I
forget
now
where
they
chiefly
go
,
but
I
think
there
be
some
among
them
that
make
voyage
both
to
the
East
and
West
Indies
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
a
great
many
empty
bottle
be
one
of
the
consequence
of
this
traffic
,
and
that
certain
man
and
boy
be
employ
to
examine
them
against
the
light
,
and
reject
those
that
be
flawed
,
and
to
rinse
and
wash
them
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
empty
bottle
run
short
,
there
be
label
to
be
paste
on
full
one
,
or
cork
to
be
fit
to
them
,
or
seal
to
be
put
upon
the
cork
,
or
finish
bottle
to
be
pack
in
cask
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
work
be
my
work
,
and
of
the
boy
employ
upon
it
I
be
one
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
three
or
four
of
us
,
count
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
working
place
be
establish
in
a
corner
of
the
warehouse
,
where
Mr
Quinion
could
see
me
,
when
he
choose
to
stand
up
on
the
bottom
rail
of
his
stool
in
the
counting
-
house
,
and
look
at
me
through
a
window
above
the
desk
.
 
<EOS>
Hither
,
on
the
first
morning
of
my
so
auspiciously
begin
life
on
my
own
account
,
the
old
of
the
regular
boy
be
summon
to
show
me
my
business
.
 
<EOS>
His
name
be
Mick
Walker
,
and
he
wear
a
ragged
apron
and
a
paper
cap
.
 
<EOS>
He
inform
me
that
his
father
be
a
bargeman
,
and
walk
,
in
a
black
velvet
head
-
dress
,
in
the
Lord
Mayor
's
Show
.
 
<EOS>
He
also
inform
me
that
our
principal
associate
would
be
another
boy
whom
he
introduce
by
the
---
to
me
---
extraordinary
name
of
Mealy
Potatoes
.
 
<EOS>
I
discover
,
however
,
that
this
youth
have
not
be
christen
by
that
name
,
but
that
it
have
be
bestow
upon
him
in
the
warehouse
,
on
account
of
his
complexion
,
which
be
pale
or
mealy
.
 
<EOS>
Mealy
's
father
be
a
waterman
,
who
have
the
additional
distinction
of
be
a
fireman
,
and
be
engage
as
such
at
one
of
the
large
theatre
;
where
some
young
relation
of
Mealy
's
---
I
think
his
little
sister
---
do
Imps
in
the
Pantomimes
.
   
<EOS>
no
word
can
express
the
secret
agony
of
my
soul
as
I
sink
into
this
companionship
;
compare
these
henceforth
everyday
associate
with
those
of
my
happy
childhood
---
not
to
say
with
Steerforth
,
Traddles
,
and
the
rest
of
those
boy
;
and
feel
my
hope
of
grow
up
to
be
a
learned
and
distinguished
man
,
crush
in
my
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
the
deep
remembrance
of
the
sense
I
have
,
of
be
utterly
without
hope
now
;
of
the
shame
I
feel
in
my
position
;
of
the
misery
it
be
to
my
young
heart
to
believe
that
day
by
day
what
I
have
learn
,
and
think
,
and
delight
in
,
and
raise
my
fancy
and
my
emulation
up
by
,
would
pass
away
from
me
,
little
by
little
,
never
to
be
bring
back
any
more
;
can
not
be
write
.
 
<EOS>
as
often
as
Mick
Walker
go
away
in
the
course
of
that
forenoon
,
I
mingle
my
tear
with
the
water
in
which
I
be
wash
the
bottle
;
and
sob
as
if
there
be
a
flaw
in
my
own
breast
,
and
it
be
in
danger
of
burst
.
   
<EOS>
the
counting
-
house
clock
be
at
half
past
twelve
,
and
there
be
general
preparation
for
go
to
dinner
,
when
Mr
Quinion
tap
at
the
counting

house
window
,
and
beckon
to
me
to
go
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
in
,
and
find
there
a
stoutish

middle

aged
person
,
in
a
brown
surtout

black
tight

than

and
with
a
very

<EOS>
His

<EOS>
He

of
rusty
tassel
to
it
;
and
a
quizzing

glass
hung
outside
his
coat
,
---
for
ornament
,
I
afterwards
find
,
as
he
very
seldom

through
it

and
could
not
see
anything

I

<EOS>
I
be
sufficiently
ill

,
Heaven
know
;
but
it
be
not
in
my
nature
to
complain
much
at

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
so
he
put
on
his
hat
,
and
go
out
with
his
cane
under
his
arm
:
very
upright
,
and
hum
a
tune
when
he
be
clear
of
the
counting
-
house
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Quinion
then
formally
engage
me
to
be
as
useful
as
I
could
in
the
warehouse
of
Murdstone
and
Grinby
,
at
a
salary
,
I
think
,
of
six
shilling
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
clear
whether
it
be
six
or
seven
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
incline
to
believe
,
from
my
uncertainty
on
this
head
,
<EOS>
that
it
be
six
at
first
and
seven
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
He
pay
me
a
week
down
(
from
his
own
pocket
,
I
believe
)
,
and
I
give
Mealy
sixpence
out
of
it
to
get
my
trunk
carry
to
Windsor
Terrace
that
night
:
it
be
too
heavy
for
my
strength
,
small
as
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
pay
sixpence
more
for
my
dinner
,
which
be
a
meat
pie
and
a
turn
at
a
neighbouring
pump
;
and
pass
the
hour
which
be
allow
for
that
meal
,
in
walk
about
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
at
the
appoint
time
in

<EOS>
I
wash
my
hand
and
face
,
to
do
the
great
honour
to
his
gentility
,
and
we
walk
to
our
house
,
as
I
suppose
I
must
now
call
it
,
together
;
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
impress
the
name
of
street
,
and
the
shape
of
corner
house
upon
me
,
as
we
go
along
,
that
I
may
find
my
way
back
,
easily
,
in
the
morning
.
   
<EOS>
arrive
at
this
house
in
Windsor
Terrace
(
which
I
notice
be
shabby
like

but
also
,
like

,
make
all
the
show
it
could

<EOS>
,
he

<EOS>
this

I

remark
here
that
I

Mrs

me
the

whether

<EOS>
I
can
not

myself
whether
she
tell
me
that
Mr

have
be
an
officer
in

whether
I
have
imagine
it

<EOS>
I
only
know
that
I
believe
to
this
hour
that
he
be
in
the
Marines
once
upon
a

without
know
why

<EOS>
He
be
a
sort
of
town
traveller

miscellaneous

make
little

nothing

I
be
afraid

"
<EOS>
if
Mr

Mrs

"
   
<EOS>
I
never
can
quite
understand
whether
my
precocious
self

dependence
confuse
Mrs
Micawber
in
reference
to
my
age

or
whether
she
be
so
full
of
the

that
she
would
have
talk
about
it
to
the
very
twin
if
there
have
be
nobody

this
be
the

I

Poor

"
swindler

robber

these
be
ineffectual

would
sometimes
go

at

scream

his

of
make
motion
at
himself
with
a
razor

within
half

he
would
polish
up
his

under

<EOS>
in

<EOS>
My

breakfast
of
a
penny
loaf

a
pennyworth
of
milk
<EOS>

I
provide
myself

<EOS>
I
keep
another
small
loaf

a

,
on
a
particular
shelf

a
particular
cupboard

to
make
my

this
make
a

I
know
well

I
be
out
at
the
warehouse
all
day

have
to
support
myself
on
that
money
all
the
week
.
 
<EOS>
from
Monday
morning

Saturday
night

I
have
no

<EOS>
I
be
so
young

childish
,
and
so
little
qualified
<EOS>
---
how
could
I
be
otherwise
?
---
to
undertake
the
whole
charge
of
my
own
existence
,
that
often
,
in
go
to
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
,
of
a
morning
,
I
could
not
resist
the
stale
pastry
put
out
for
sale
at
half
-
price
at
the
pastrycooks
'
door
,
and
spend
in
that
the
money
I
should
have
keep
for
my
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
I
go
without
my
dinner
,
or
buy
a
roll
or
a
slice
of
pudding
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
two
pudding
shop
,
between
which
I
be
divide
,
accord
to
my
finance
.
 
<EOS>
one
be
in
a
court
close
to
St
Martin

Church

at
the
back
of
the
church
,
---
which
be
now
remove
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
the
pudding
at
that
shop
be
make
of
currant
,
and
be
rather
a
special
pudding
,
but
be
dear
,
twopennyworth
not
be
large
than
a
pennyworth
of
more
ordinary
pudding
.
 
<EOS>
a
good
shop
for
the
latter
be
in
the
Strand
---
somewhere
in
that
part
which
have
be
rebuild
since
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
stout
pale
pudding
,
heavy
and
flabby
,
and
with
great
flat
raisin
in
it
,
stick
in
whole
at
wide
distance
apart
.
 
<EOS>
It
come
up
hot
at
about
my
time
every
day
,
and
many
a
day
do
I
dine
off
it
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
dine
regularly
and
handsomely
,
I
have
a
saveloy
and
a
penny
loaf
,
or
a
fourpenny
plate
of
red
beef
from
a
cook
's
shop
;
or
a
plate
of
bread
and
cheese
and
a
glass
of
beer
,
from
a
miserable
old
public
-
house
opposite
our
place
of
business
,
call
the
Lion
,
or
the
Lion
and
something
else
that
I
have
forget
.
 
<EOS>
once
,
I
remember
carry
my
own
bread
(
which
I
have
bring
from
home
in
the
morning
)
under
my
arm
,
wrap
in
a
piece
of
paper
,
like
a
book
,
and
go
to
a
famous
alamode
beef
-
house
near
Drury
Lane
,
and
order
a
"
small
plate
"
of
that
delicacy
to
eat
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
what
the
waiter
thought
of
such
a
strange
little
apparition
come
in
all
alone
,
I
do
not
know
;
but
I
can
see
him
now
,
stare
at
me
as
I
eat
my
dinner
,
and
bring
up
the
other
waiter
to
look
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
him
a
halfpenny
for
himself
,
and
I
wish
he
have
not
take
it
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
half
-
an
-
hour
,
I
think
,
for
tea
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
money
enough
,
I
use
to
get
half
-
a
-
pint
of
ready
-
make
coffee
and
a
slice
of
bread
and
butter
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
none
,
I
use
to
look
at
a
venison
shop
in
Fleet
Street
;
or
I
have
stroll
,
at
such
a
time
,
as
far
as
Covent
Garden
Market
,
and
stare
at
the
pineapple
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
fond
of
wander
about
the
Adelphi
,
because
it
be
a
mysterious
place
,
with
those
dark
arch
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
myself
emerge
one
evening
from
some
of
these
arch
,
on
a
little
public
-
house
close
to
the
river
,
with
an
open
space
before
it
,
where
some
coal
-
heaver
be
dance
;
to
look
at
whom
I
sit
down
upon
a
bench
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
they
think
of
me
!
   
<EOS>
I
be
such
a
child
,
and
so
little
,
that
frequently
when
I
go
into
the
bar
of
a
strange
public
-
house
for
a
glass
of
ale
or
porter
,
to
moisten
what
I
have
have
for
dinner
,
they
be
afraid
to
give
it
me
.
<EOS>
I
remember
one
hot
evening
<EOS>
I
go
into
the
bar
of
a
public
-
house
,
and
say
to
the
landlord
:
"
what
be
your
good
---
your
very
good
---
ale
a
glass
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
for
it
be
a
special
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
my
birthday
.
   
<EOS>
"
twopence
-
halfpenny
,
"
say
the
landlord
,
"
be
the
price
of
the
genuine
stunning
ale
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
then
,
"
say
I
,
produce
the
money
,
"
just
draw
me
a
glass
of
the
genuine
Stunning
,
if
you
please
,
with
a
good
head
to
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
landlord
look
at
me
in
return
over
the
bar
,
from
head
to
foot
,
with
a
strange
smile
on
his
face
;
and
instead
of
draw
the
beer
,
look
round
the
screen
and
say
something
to
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
She
come
out
from
behind
it
,
with
her
work
in
her
hand
,
and
join
him
in
survey
me
.
 
<EOS>
here
we
stand
,
all
three
,
before
me
now
.
 
<EOS>
the
landlord
in
his
shirt
-
sleeve
,
lean
against
the
bar
window
-
frame
;
his
wife
look
over
the
little
half
-
door
;
and
I
,
in
some
confusion
,
look
up
at
them
from
outside
the
partition
.
<EOS>
They
ask
me
a
good
many
question
;
as
,
what
my
name
be
,
<EOS>
how
old
I
be
,
where
I
live
,
how
I
be
employ
,
and
how
I
come
there
.
 
<EOS>
to
all
of
which
,
that
I
may
commit
nobody
<EOS>
,
I
invent
,
I
be
afraid
,
appropriate
answer
.
 
<EOS>
They
serve
me
with
the
ale
,
though
I
suspect
it
be
not
the
genuine
Stunning
;
and
the
landlord
's
wife
,
open
the
little
half
-
door
of
the
bar
,
and
bend
down
,
give
me
my
money
back
,
and
give
me
a
kiss
that
be
half
admiring
and
half
compassionate
,
but
all
womanly
and
good
,
I
be
sure
.
   
<EOS>
I
know
I
do
not
exaggerate
,
unconsciously
and
unintentionally
,
<EOS>
the
scantiness
of
my
resource
or
the
difficulty
of
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
if
a
shilling
be
give
me
by
Mr
Quinion
at
any
time
,
I
spend
it
in
a
dinner
or
a
tea
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
I
work
,
from
morning
until
night
,
with
common
man
and
boy
,
a
shabby
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
I
lounge
about
the
street
,
insufficiently
and
unsatisfactorily
feed
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
,
but
for
the
mercy
of
God
,
I
may
easily
have
be
,
for
any
care
that
be
take
of
me
,
a
little
robber
or
a
little
vagabond
.
   
<EOS>
yet
I
hold
some
station
at
Murdstone
and
Grinby
be
too
.
 
<EOS>
besides
that
Mr
Quinion
do
what
a
careless
man
so
occupied
,
and
deal
with
a
thing
so
anomalous
,
could
,
to
treat
me
as
one
upon
a
different
footing
from
the
rest
,
I
never
say
,
to
man
or
boy
,
how
it
be
that
I
come
to
be
there
,
or
give
the
least
indication
of
be
sorry
that
I
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
suffer
in
secret
,
and
that
I
suffer
exquisitely
,
no
one
ever
know
but
I.
 
how
much
I
suffer
,
it
be
,
as
I
have
say
already
,
utterly
beyond
my
power
to
tell
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
keep
my
own
counsel
,
and
I
do
my
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
from
the
first
,
that
,
if
I
could
not
do
my
work
as
well
as
any
of
the
rest
,
I
could
not
hold
myself
above
slight
and
contempt
.
 
<EOS>
I
soon
become
at
least
as
expeditious
and
as
skilful
as
either
of
the
other
boy
.
 
<EOS>
though
perfectly
familiar
with
them
,
my
conduct
and
manner
be
different
enough
from
theirs
to
place
a
space
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
They
and
the
man
generally
speak
of
me
as
"
the
little
gent
"
,
or
"
the
young
Suffolker
.
"
 
<EOS>
a
certain
man
name
Gregory
,
who
be
foreman
of
the
packer
,
and
another
name
Tipp
,
who
be
the
carman
,
and
wear
a
red
jacket
,
use
to
address
me
sometimes
as
"
David
"
:
<EOS>
but
I
think
it
be
mostly
when
we
be
very
confidential
,
and
when
I
have
make
some
effort
to
entertain
them
,
over
our
work
,
with
some
result
of
the
old
reading
;
which
be
fast
perish
out
of
my
remembrance
.
 
<EOS>
Mealy
Potatoes
uprose
once
,
and
rebel
against
my
being
so
distinguished
;
but
Mick
Walker
settle
him
in
no
time
.
   
<EOS>
My
rescue
from
this
kind
of
existence
<EOS>
I
consider
quite
hopeless
,
and
abandon
,
as
such
,
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
solemnly
convinced
that
I
never
for
one
hour
be
reconcile
to
it
,
or
be
otherwise
than
miserably
unhappy
;
but
I
bear
it
;
and
even
to
Peggotty
,
partly
for
the
love
of
her
and
partly
for
shame
,
never
in
any
letter
(
though
many
pass
between
us
)
reveal
the
truth
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
's
difficulty
be
an
addition
to
the
distressed
state
of
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
in
my
forlorn
state
I
become
quite
attach
to
the
family
,
and
use
to
walk
about
,
busy
with
Mrs
Micawber
's
calculation
of
way
and
mean
,
and
heavy
with
the
weight
of
Mr
Micawber
's
debt
.
 
<EOS>
on
a
Saturday
night
,
which
be
my
grand
treat
,
---
partly
because
it
be
a
great
thing
to
walk
home
with
six
or
seven
shilling
in
my
pocket
,
look
into
the
shop
and
think
what
such
a
sum
would
buy
,
and
partly
because
I
go
home
early
,
---
Mrs
Micawber
would
make
the
most
heart
-
rend
confidence
to
me
;
also
on
a
Sunday
morning
,
when
I
mix
the
portion
of
tea
or
coffee
I
have
buy
over
-
night
,
in
a
little
shaving
-
pot
,
and
sit
late
at
my
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
nothing
at
all
unusual
for
Mr
Micawber
to
sob
violently
at
the
beginning
of
one
of
these
Saturday
night
conversation
,
and
sing
about
jack
's
delight
be
his
lovely
Nan
,
towards
the
end
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
know
him
come
home
to
supper
with
a
flood
of
tear
,
and
a
declaration
that
nothing
be
now
leave
but
a
jail
;
and
go
to
bed
make
a
calculation
of
the
expense
of
put
bow
-
window
to
the
house
,
"
in
case
anything
turn
up
"
,
which
be
his
favourite
expression
.
 
<EOS>
and
Mrs
Micawber
be
just
the
same
.
   
<EOS>
a
curious
equality
of
friendship
,
originating
,
I
suppose
,
in
our
respective
circumstance
,
spring
up
between
me
and
these
people
,
notwithstanding
the
ludicrous
disparity
in
our
year
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
never
allow
myself
to
be
prevail
upon
to
accept
any
invitation
to
eat
and
drink
with
them
out
of
their
stock
(
know
that
they
get
on
badly
with
the
butcher
and
baker
,
and
have
often
not
too
much
for
themselves
)
,
until
Mrs
Micawber
take
me
into
her
entire
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
she
do
one
evening
as
follow
:
   
<EOS>
"
Master
Copperfield
,
"
say
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
I
make
no
stranger
of
you
,
and
therefore
do
not
hesitate
to
say
that
Mr
Micawber
's
difficulty
be
come
to
a
crisis
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
make
me
very
miserable
to
hear
it
,
and
I
look
at
Mrs
Micawber
's
red
eye
with
the
utmost
sympathy
.
   
<EOS>
"
with
the
exception
of
the
heel
of
a
dutch
cheese
---
which
be
not
adapt
to
the
want
of
a
young
family
"
---
say
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
there
be
really
not
a
scrap
of
anything
in
the
larder
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
accustomed
to
speak
of
the
larder
when
I
live
with
papa
and
mama
,
and
I
use
the
word
almost
unconsciously
.
 
<EOS>
what
I
mean
to
express
be
,
that
there
be
nothing
to
eat
in
the
house
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
dear
me
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
say
,
in
great
concern
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
two
or
three
shilling
of
my
week
's
money
in
my
pocket
---
<EOS>
from
which
I
presume
that
it
must
have
be
on
a
Wednesday
night
when
we
hold
this
conversation
---
and
I
hastily
produce
them
,
and
with
heartfelt
emotion
beg
Mrs
Micawber
to
accept
of
them
as
a
loan
.
<EOS>
but
that
lady
,
kiss
me
,
and
make
me
put
them
back
in
my
pocket
,
reply
that
she
could
not
think
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
my
dear
Master
Copperfield
,
"
say
she
,
"
far
be
it
from
my
thought
!
 
<EOS>
but
you
have
a
discretion
beyond
your
year
,
and
can
render
me
another
kind
of
service
,
if
you
will
;
and
a
service
I
will
thankfully
accept
of
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
beg
Mrs
Micawber
to
name
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
part
with
the
plate
myself
,
"
say
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
"
six
tea
,
two
salt
,
and
a
pair
of
sugar
,
I
have
at
different
time
borrow
money
on
,
in
secret
,
with
my
own
hand
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
twin
be
a
great
tie
;
and
to
me
,
with
my
recollection
,
of
papa
and
mama
,
these
transaction
be
very
painful
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
still
a
few
trifle
that
we
could
part
with
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
's
feeling
would
never
allow
him
to
dispose
of
them
;
and
Clickett
"
---
this
be
the
girl
from
the
workhouse
---
"
be
of
a
vulgar
mind
,
would
take
painful
liberty
if
so
much
confidence
be
repose
in
her
.
 
<EOS>
Master
Copperfield
,
if
I
may
ask
you
---
"
   
I
understand
Mrs
Micawber
now
,
and
beg
her
to
make
use
of
me
to
any
extent
.
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
dispose
of
the
more
portable
article
of
property
that
very
evening
;
and
go
out
on
a
similar
expedition
almost
every
morning
,
before
I
go
to
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
have
a
few
book
on
a
little
chiffoni
,
which
he
call
the
library
;
and
those
go
first
.
 
<EOS>
I
carry
them
,
one
after
another
,
to
a
bookstall
in
the
City
Road
---
<EOS>
one
part
of
which
,
near
our
house
,
be
almost
all
bookstall
and
bird
shop
then
---
and
sell
them
for
whatever
they
would
bring
.
 
<EOS>
the
keeper
of
this
bookstall
,
who
live
in
a
little
house
behind
it
,
use
to
get
tipsy
every
night
,
and
to
be
violently
scold
by
his
wife
every
morning
.
<EOS>
more
than
once
,
when
I
go
there
early
,
I
have
audience
of
him
in
a
turn
-
up
bedstead
,
with
a
cut
in
his
forehead
or
a
black
eye
,
bear
witness
to
his
excess
over
-
night
<EOS>
(
I
be
afraid
he
be
quarrelsome
in
his
drink
)
,
and
he
,
with
a
shake
hand
,
endeavour
to
find
the
needful
shilling
in
one
or
other
of
the
pocket
of
his
clothe
,
which
lie
upon
the
floor
,
while
his
wife
,
with
a
baby
in
her
arm
and
her
shoe
down
at
heel
,
never
leave
off
rate
him
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
he
have
lose
his
money
,
and
then
he
would
ask
me
to
call
again
;
but
his
wife
have
always
get
some
---
have
take
his
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
while
he
be
drunk
---
and
secretly
complete
the
bargain
on
the
stair
,
as
we
go
down
together
.
<EOS>
at
the
pawnbroker
's
shop
,
too
,
I
begin
to
be
very
well
know
.
 
<EOS>
the
principal
gentleman
who
officiate
behind
the
counter
,
take
a
good
deal
of
notice
of
me
;
and
often
get
me
,
I
recollect
,
to
decline
a
latin
noun
or
adjective
,
or
to
conjugate
a
latin
verb
,
in
his
ear
,
while
he
transact
my
business
.
 
<EOS>
after
all
these
occasion
Mrs
Micawber
make
a
little
treat
,
which
be
generally
a
supper
;
and
there
be
a
peculiar
relish
in
these
meal
which
I
well
remember
.
   
<EOS>
at
last
Mr
Micawber
's
difficulty
come
to
a
crisis
,
and
he
be
arrest
early
one
morning
,
and
carry
over
to
the
King
's
Bench
Prison
in
the
Borough
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
as
he
go
out
of
the
house
,
that
the
God
of
day
have
now
go
down
upon
him
---
and
I
really
think
his
heart
be
break
and
mine
too
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
hear
,
afterwards
,
that
he
be
see
to
play
a
lively
game
at
skittle
,
before
noon
.
   
<EOS>
on
the
first
Sunday
after
he
be
take
there
,
I
be
to
go
and
see
him
,
and
have
dinner
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
to
ask
my
way
to
such
a
place
,
and
just
short
of
that
place
<EOS>
I
should
see
such
another
place
,
and
just
short
of
that
I
should
see
a
yard
,
which
I
be
to
cross
,
and
keep
straight
on
until
I
see
a
turnkey
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
I
do
;
and
when
at
last
I
do
see
a
turnkey
(
poor
little
fellow
that
I
be
!
)
,
and
think
how
,
when
Roderick
Random
be
in
a
debtor
'
prison
,
there
be
a
man
there
with
nothing
on
him
but
an
old
rug
,
the
turnkey
swam
before
my
dimmed
eye
and
my
beat
heart
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
be
wait
for
me
within
the
gate
,
and
we
go
up
to
his
room
(
top
story
but
one
)
,
and
cry
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
He
solemnly
conjure
me
,
I
remember
,
to
take
warning
by
his
fate
;
and
to
observe
that
if
a
man
have
twenty
pound
a
-
year
for
his
income
,
and
spend
nineteen
pound
nineteen
shilling
and
sixpence
,
he
would
be
happy
,
but
that
if
he
spend
twenty
pound
one
he
would
be
miserable
.
 
<EOS>
after
which
he
borrow
a
shilling
of
me
for
porter
,
give
me
a
write
order
on
Mrs
Micawber
for
the
amount
,
and
put
away
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
and
cheer
up
.
   
<EOS>
We
sit
before
a
little
fire
,
with
two
brick
put
within
the
rust
grate
,
one
on
each
side
,
to
prevent
its
burning
too
many
coal
;
until
another
debtor
,
who
share
the
room
with
Mr
Micawber
,
come
in
from
the
bakehouse
with
the
loin
of
mutton
which
be
our
joint
-
stock
repast
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
be
send
up
to
"
Captain
Hopkins
"
in
the
room
overhead
,
with
Mr
Micawber
's
compliment
,
and
I
be
his
young
friend
,
and
would
Captain
Hopkins
lend
me
a
knife
and
fork
.
   
<EOS>
Captain
Hopkins
lend
me
the
knife
and
fork
,
with
his
compliment
to
Mr
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
very
dirty
lady
in
his
little
room
,
and
two
wan
girl
,
his
daughter
,
with
shock
head
of
hair
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
well
to
borrow
Captain
Hopkins
's
knife
and
fork
,
than
Captain
Hopkins
's
comb
.
 
<EOS>
the
Captain
himself
be
in
the
last
extremity
of
shabbiness
,
with
large
whisker
,
and
an
old
,
old
brown
great
-
coat
with
no
other
coat
below
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
his
bed
roll
up
in
a
corner
;
and
what
plate
and
dish
and
pot
he
have
,
on
a
shelf
;
and
I
divine
(
God
know
how
)
that
though
the
two
girl
with
the
shock
head
of
hair
be
Captain
Hopkins
's
child
,
the
dirty
lady
be
not
married
to
Captain
Hopkins
.
 
<EOS>
My
timid
station
on
his
threshold
be
not
occupy
more
than
a
couple
of
minute
at
most
;
but
I
come
down
again
with
all
this
in
my
knowledge
,
as
surely
as
the
knife
and
fork
be
in
my
hand
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
something
gipsy
-
like
and
agreeable
in
the
dinner
,
after
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
back
Captain
Hopkins
's
knife
and
fork
early
in
the
afternoon
,
and
go
home
to
comfort
Mrs
Micawber
with
an
account
of
my
visit
.
 
<EOS>
She
faint
when
she
see
me
return
,
and
make
a
little
jug
of
egg
-
hot
afterwards
to
console
us
while
we
talk
it
over
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
the
household
furniture
come
to
be
sell
for
the
family
benefit
,
or
who
sell
it
,
except
that
I
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
sell
it
be
,
however
,
and
carry
away
in
a
van
;
except
the
bed
,
a
few
chair
,
and
the
kitchen
table
.
 
<EOS>
with
these
possession
we
encamp
,
as
it
be
,
in
the
two
parlour
of
the
empty
house
in
Windsor
Terrace
;
<EOS>
Mrs
Micawber
,
the
child
,
the
orfling
,
and
myself
;
and
live
in
those
room
night
and
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
idea
for
how
long
,
though
it
seem
to
me
for
a
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
Mrs
Micawber
resolve
to
move
into
the
prison
,
where
Mr
Micawber
have
now
secure
a
room
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
take
the
key
of
the
house
to
the
landlord
,
who
be
very
glad
to
get
it
;
and
the
bed
be
send
over
to
the
King
's
Bench
,
except
mine
,
for
which
a
little
room
be
hire
outside
the
wall
in
the
neighbourhood
of
that
institution
,
very
much
to
my
satisfaction
,
since
the
Micawbers
<EOS>
and
I
have
become
too
used
to
one
another
,
in
our
trouble
,
to
part
.
 
<EOS>
the
Orfling
be
likewise
accommodate
with
an
inexpensive
lodging
in
the
same
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
Mine
be
a
quiet
back
-
garret
with
a
sloping
roof
,
command
a
pleasant
prospect
of
a
timberyard
;
and
when
I
take
possession
of
it
,
with
the
reflection
that
Mr
Micawber
's
trouble
have
come
to
a
crisis
at
last
,
I
think
it
quite
a
paradise
.
   
<EOS>
all
this
time
I
be
work
at
Murdstone
and
Grinby
be
in
the
same
common
way
,
and
with
the
same
common
companion
,
and
with
the
same
sense
of
unmerited
degradation
as
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
never
,
happily
for
me
no
doubt
,
make
a
single
acquaintance
,
or
speak
to
any
of
the
many
boy
whom
I
see
daily
in
go
to
the
warehouse
,
in
come
from
it
,
and
in
prowl
about
the
street
at
meal
-
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
lead
the
same
secretly
unhappy
life
;
but
I
lead
it
in
the
same
lonely
,
self
-
reliant
manner
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
change
I
be
conscious
of
be
,
firstly
,
that
I
have
grow
more
shabby
,
and
secondly
,
that
I
be
now
relieve
of
much
of
the
weight
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
's
care
;
for
some
relative
or
friend
have
engage
to
help
them
at
their
present
pass
,
and
they
live
more
comfortably
in
the
prison
than
they
have
live
for
a
long
while
out
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
use
to
breakfast
with
them
now
,
in
virtue
of
some
arrangement
,
of
which
I
have
forget
the
detail
.
 
<EOS>
I
forget
,
too
,
at
what
hour
the
gate
be
open
in
the
morning
,
admit
of
my
go
in
;
but
I
know
that
I
be
often
up
at
six
o'clock
,
and
that
my
favourite
lounging
-
place
in
the
interval
be
old
London
Bridge
,
where
I
be
will
not
to
sit
in
one
of
the
stone
recess
,
watch
the
people
go
by
,
or
to
look
over
the
balustrade
at
the
sun
shine
in
the
water
,
and
light
up
the
golden
flame
on
the
top
of
the
Monument
.
 
<EOS>
the
Orfling
meet
me
here
sometimes
,
to
be
tell
some
astonishing
fiction
respect
the
wharf
and
the
Tower
;
of
which
I
can
say
no
more
than
that
<EOS>
I
hope
I
believe
them
myself
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
evening
I
use
to
go
back
to
the
prison
,
and
walk
up
and
down
the
parade
with
Mr
Micawber
;
or
play
casino
with
Mrs
Micawber
,
and
hear
reminiscence
of
her
papa
and
mama
.
 
<EOS>
whether
Mr
Murdstone
know
where
I
be
,
I
be
unable
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
never
tell
them
at
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
's
affair
,
although
past
their
crisis
,
be
very
much
involve
by
reason
of
a
certain
"
Deed
"
,
of
which
I
use
to
hear
a
great
deal
,
and
which
I
suppose
,
now
,
to
have
be
some
former
composition
with
his
creditor
,
though
I
be
so
far
from
be
clear
about
it
then
,
that
I
be
conscious
of
have
confound
it
with
those
demoniacal
parchment
which
be
hold
to
have
,
once
upon
a
time
,
obtain
to
a
great
extent
in
Germany
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
this
document
appear
to
be
get
out
of
the
way
,
somehow
;
at
all
event
it
cease
to
be
the
rock
-
ahead
it
have
be
;
and
Mrs
Micawber
inform
me
that
"
her
family
"
have
decide
that
Mr
Micawber
should
apply
for
his
release
under
the
Insolvent
Debtors
Act
,
which
would
set
him
free
,
she
expect
,
in
about
six
week
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
"
say
Mr
Micawber
,
who
be
present
,
"
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
I
shall
,
please
Heaven
,
begin
to
be
beforehand
with
the
world
,
and
to
live
in
a
perfectly
new
manner
,
if
---
in
short
,
if
anything
turn
up
.
"
   
<EOS>
by
way
of
go
in
for
anything
that
may
be
on
the
card
,
I
call
to
mind
that
Mr
Micawber
,
about
this
time
,
compose
a
petition
to
the
House
of
Commons
,
pray
for
an
alteration
in
the
law
of
imprisonment
for
debt
.
 
<EOS>
I
set
down
this
remembrance
here
,
because
it
be
an
instance
to
myself
of
the
manner
in
which
I
fit
my
old
book
to
my
altered
life
,
and
make
story
for
myself
,
out
of
the
street
,
and
out
of
man
and
woman
;
and
how
some
main
point
in
the
character
I
shall
unconsciously
develop
,
I
suppose
,
in
write
my
life
,
be
gradually
form
all
this
while
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
club
in
the
prison
,
in
which
Mr
Micawber
,
as
a
gentleman
,
be
a
great
authority
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
have
state
his
idea
of
this
petition
to
the
club
,
and
the
club
have
strongly
approve
of
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Wherefore
Mr
Micawber
(
who
be
a
thoroughly
good
-
natured
man
,
and
as
active
a
creature
about
everything
but
his
own
affair
as
ever
exist
,
and
never
so
happy
as
when
he
be
busy
about
something
that
could
never
be
of
any
profit
to
him
)
set
to
work
at
the
petition
,
invent
it
,
engross
it
on
an
immense
sheet
of
paper
,
spread
it
out
on
a
table
,
and
appoint
a
time
for
all
the
club
,
and
all
within
the
wall
if
they
choose
,
to
come
up
to
his
room
and
sign
it
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
hear
of
this
approach
ceremony
,
I
be
so
anxious
to
see
them
all
come
in
,
one
after
another
,
though
I
know
the
great
part
of
them
already
,
and
they
me
,
that
I
get
an
hour
's
leave
of
absence
from
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
,
and
establish
myself
in
a
corner
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
as
many
of
the
principal
member
of
the
club
as
could
be
get
into
the
small
room
without
fill
it
,
support
Mr
Micawber
in
front
of
the
petition
,
while
my
old
friend
Captain
Hopkins
(
who
have
wash
himself
,
to
do
honour
to
so
solemn
an
occasion
)
<EOS>
station
himself
close
to
it
,
to
read
it
to
all
who
be
unacquainted
with
its
content
.
 
<EOS>
the
door
be
then
throw
open
,
and
the
general
population
begin
to
come
in
,
in
a
long
file
:
several
wait
outside
,
while
one
enter
,
affixed
his
signature
,
and
go
out
.
 
<EOS>
to
everybody
in
succession
,
Captain
Hopkins
say
:
"
have
you
read
it
?
"
---
"
no
.
"
 
---
"
Would
you
like
to
hear
it
read
?
"
 
<EOS>
if
he
weakly
show
the
least
disposition
to
hear
it
,
Captain
Hopkins
,
in
a
loud
sonorous
voice
,
give
him
every
word
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
Captain
would
have
read
it
twenty
thousand
time
,
if
twenty
thousand
people
would
have
hear
him
,
one
by
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
a
certain
luscious
roll
he
give
to
such
phrase
as
"
the
people
's
representative
in
Parliament
assemble
,
"
"
Your
petitioner
therefore
humbly
approach
your
honourable
house
,
"
"
His
gracious
Majesty
's
unfortunate
subject
,
"
as
if
the
word
be
something
real
in
his
mouth
,
and
delicious
to
taste
;
Mr
Micawber
,
meanwhile
,
listen
with
a
little
of
an
author
's
vanity
,
and
contemplate
(
not
severely
)
the
spike
on
the
opposite
wall
.
   
<EOS>
as
I
walk
to
and
fro
daily
between
Southwark
and
Blackfriars
,
and
lounge
about
at
meal
-
time
in
obscure
street
,
the
stone
of
which
may
,
for
anything
I
know
,
be
wear
at
this
moment
by
my
childish
foot
,
I
wonder
how
many
of
these
people
be
want
in
the
crowd
that
use
to
come
filing
before
me
in
review
again
,
to
the
echo
of
Captain
Hopkins
's
voice
!
 
<EOS>
when
my
thought
go
back
,
now
,
to
that
slow
agony
of
my
youth
,
I
wonder
how
much
of
the
history
I
invent
for
such
people
hang
like
a
mist
of
fancy
over
well
-
remember
fact
!
 
<EOS>
when
I
tread
the
old
ground
,
I
do
not
wonder
that
I
seem
to
see
and
pity
,
go
on
before
me
,
an
innocent
romantic
boy
,
make
his
imaginative
world
out
of
such
strange
experience
and
sordid
thing
!

<EOS>
like
life
on
my
own
account
no
better
,
I
form
a
great
resolution
 
<EOS>
in
due
time
,
Mr
Micawber
's
petition
be
ripe
for
hearing
;
and
that
gentleman
be
order
to
be
discharge
under
the
Act
,
to
my
great
joy
.
 
<EOS>
His
creditor
be
not
implacable
;
and
Mrs
Micawber
inform
me
that
even
the
revengeful
boot
-
maker
have
declare
in
open
court
that
he
bear
him
no
malice
,
but
that
when
money
be
owe
to
him
he
like
to
be
pay
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
he
think
it
be
human
nature
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
return
to
the
King
's
Bench
when
his
case
be
over
,
as
some
fee
be
to
be
settle
,
and
some
formality
observe
,
before
he
could
be
actually
release
.
 
<EOS>
the
club
receive
him
with
transport
,
and
hold
an
harmonic
meeting
that
evening
in
his
honour
;
while
Mrs
Micawber
and
I
have
a
lamb
's
fry
in
private
,
surround
by
the
sleep
family
.
   
<EOS>
"
on
such
an
occasion
I
will
give
you

Master
Copperfield

say
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
in
a
little
more

<EOS>
"
My

Mrs

"
before
Mr

before

<EOS>
My

to
bail
Mr

several
time
,
and
then
expire

by
a
numerous
circle

"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Micawber
shake
her
head
,
and
drop
a
pious
tear
upon
the
twin
who
happen
to
be
in
hand
.
   
<EOS>
as
I
could
hardly
hope
for
a
more
favourable
opportunity
of
put
a
question
in
which
I
have
a
near
interest
,
I
say
to
Mrs
Micawber
:
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
,
madam
,
what
you
and
Mr
Micawber
intend
to
do
,
now
that
Mr
Micawber
be
out
of
his
difficulty

and
at
liberty

have
you
settle
yet

"
My

Mrs
Micawber

who
always
say
those
two

with
an
air

I
never
could
discover
who
come
under

"
my

be
of
opinion
that
Mr

should
quit

repeat
Mrs

<EOS>
Mr

may
have
conceal

Mr

be
so
deeply
affected
by
this
proof
of
her
devotion

I
be
dissolve

Consequently

I
would

he
would
not
hear

I
sit
at

shed
tear
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
greatly
touch
,
and
disappoint
too
,
for
I
have
expect
that
we
should
be
quite
gay
on
this
happy
and
long
-
look
-
for
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
be
so
used
to
their
old
difficulty
,
I
think
,
that
they
feel
quite
shipwreck
when
they
come
to
consider
that
they
be
release
from
them
.
 
<EOS>
all
their
elasticity
be
depart
,
and
I
never
see
them
half
<EOS>
so
wretched
as
on
this
night
;
insomuch
that
when
the
bell
rang
,
and
Mr
Micawber
walk
with
me
to
the
lodge
,
and
part
from
me
there
with
a
blessing
,
I
feel
quite
afraid
to
leave
him
by
himself
,
he
be
so
profoundly
miserable
.
   
<EOS>
but
through
all
the
confusion
and
lowness
of
spirit
in
which
we
have
be
,
so
unexpectedly
to
me
,
involve
,
I
plainly
discern
that
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
and
their
family
be
go
away
from
London
,
and
that
a
parting
between
us
be
near
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
my
walk
home
that
night
,
and
in
the
sleepless
hour
which
follow
when
I
lie
in
bed
,
that
the
thought
first
occur
to
me
---
though
I
do
not
know
how
it
come
into
my
head
---
which
afterwards
shape
itself
into
a
settle
resolution
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
grow
to
be
so
accustomed
to
the
Micawbers
,
and
have
be
so
intimate
with
them
in
their
distress
,
and
be
so
utterly
friendless
without
them
,
that
the
prospect
of
be
throw
upon
some
new
shift
for
a
lodging
,
and
go
once
more
among
unknown
people
,
be
like
be
that
moment
turn
adrift
into
my
present
life
,
with
such
a
knowledge
of
it
ready
make
as
experience
have
give
me
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
sensitive
feeling
it
wound
so
cruelly
<EOS>
,
all
the
shame
and
misery
it
keep
alive
within
my
breast
,
become
more
poignant
as
I
think
of
this
;
and
I
determine
that
the
life
be
unendurable
.
   
<EOS>
that
there
be
no
hope
of
escape
from
it
,
<EOS>
unless
the
escape
be
my
own
act
,
I
know
quite
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
rarely
hear
from
Miss
Murdstone
,
and
never
from
Mr
Murdstone
:
but
two
or
three
parcel
of
make
or
mend
clothe
have
come
up
for
me
,
consign
to
Mr
Quinion
,
and
in
each
there
be
a
scrap
of
paper
to
the
effect
that
j*m
trust
D*C
be
apply
himself
to
business
,
and
devote
himself
wholly
to
his
duty
---
not
the
least
hint
of
my
ever
be
anything
else
than
the
common
drudge
into
which
I
be
fast
settle
down
.
   
<EOS>
the
very
next
day
show
me
,
while
my
mind
be
in
the
first
agitation
of
what
it
have
conceive
,
that
Mrs
Micawber
have
not
speak
of
their
go
away
without
warrant
.
 
<EOS>
They
take
a
lodging
in
the
house
where
I
live
,
for
a
week
;
at
the
expiration
of
which
time
they
be
to
start
for
Plymouth
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
himself
come
down
to
the
counting
-
house
,
in
the
afternoon
,
to
tell
Mr
Quinion
that
he
must
relinquish
me
on
the
day
of
his
departure
,
and
to
give
me
a
high
character
,
which
I
be
sure
I
deserve
.
 
<EOS>
and
Mr
Quinion
,
call
in
Tipp
the
carman
,
who
be
a
married
man
,
and
have
a
room
to
let
,
quarter
me
prospectively
on
him
---
by
our
mutual
consent
,
as
he
have
every
reason
to
think
;
for
I
say
nothing
,
though
my
resolution
be
now
take
.
   
<EOS>
I
pass
my
evening
with
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
,
during
the
remaining
term
of
our
residence
under
the
same
roof
;
and
I
think
we
become
fonder
of
one
another
as
the
time
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
last
Sunday
,
they
invite
me
to
dinner
;
and
we
have
a
loin
of
pork
and
apple
sauce
,
and
a
pudding
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
buy
a
spotted
wooden
horse
over
-
night
as
a
part
gift
to
little
Wilkins
Micawber
<EOS>
---
that

and
a

for
little
Emma

<EOS>
I
have
also
bestow
a
shilling
on
the
orfling
,
who
be
about
to
be
disband
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
a
very
pleasant
day
,
though
we
be
all
in
a
tender
state
about
our
approach
separation
.
   
<EOS>
"
I

Mrs
Micawber

I

apply

Mr

look
aside
at

you
be
for

<EOS>

I
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
to
make
his
example
the
more
impressive
,
Mr
Micawber
drink
a
glass
of
punch
with
an
air
of
great
enjoyment
and
satisfaction
,
and
whistle
the
College
Hornpipe
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
fail
to
assure
him
that
I
would
store
these
precept
in
my
mind
,
though
indeed
I
have
no
need
to
do
so
,
for
,
at
the
time
,
they
affect
me
visibly
.
 
<EOS>
next
morning
I
meet
the
whole
family
at
the
coach
office
,
and
see
them
,
with
a
desolate
heart
,
take
their
place
outside
,
at
the
back
.
   
<EOS>
"
Master
Copperfield

Mrs
Micawber
,
"
God
bless
you

I

all
that
,
you
know

I
never
would

I
could

<EOS>
"
Copperfield

Mr

"
farewell
!
 
<EOS>
every
happiness

prosperity

<EOS>
if
,
in
the
progress
of
revolving
year
,
I
could
persuade
myself
that
my
blight
destiny
have
be
a
warning
to
you
,
I
should
feel
that
I
have
not
occupy
another
man
's
place
in
existence
altogether
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
in
case
of
anything
turn
up
(
of
which
I
be
rather
confident
)
,
I
shall
be
extremely
happy
if
it
should
be
in
my
power
to
improve
your
prospect
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
think
,
as
Mrs
Micawber
sit
at
the
back
of
the
coach
,
with
the
child
,
and
I
stand
in
the
road
look
wistfully
at
them
,
a
mist
clear
from
her
eye
,
and
she
see
what
a
little
creature
I
really
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
so
,
because
she
beckon
to
me
to
climb
up
,
with
quite
a
new
and
motherly
expression
in
her
face
,
and
put
her
arm
<EOS>
round
my
neck
,
and
give
me
just
such
a
kiss
as
she
may
have
give
to
her
own
boy
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
barely
time
to
get
down
again
before
the
coach
start
,
and
I
could
hardly
see
the
family
for
the
handkerchief
they
wave
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
go
in
a
minute
.
 
<EOS>
the
Orfling
and
I
stand
look
vacantly
at
each
other
in
the
middle
of
the
road
,
and
then
shake
hand
and
say
good
-
bye
<EOS>
;
she
go
back
,
I
suppose
,
to
St
Luke
's
workhouse
,
as
I
go
to
begin
my
weary
day
at
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
.
   
<EOS>
but
with
no
intention
of
pass
many
more
weary
day
there
.
 
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
I
have
resolve
to
run
away
.
 
<EOS>
---
to
go
,
by
some
mean
or
other
,
down
into
the
country
,
to
the
only
relation
I
have
in
the
world
,
and
tell
my
story
to
my
aunt
,
Miss
Betsey
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
observe
that
I
do
not
know
how
this
desperate
idea
come
into
my
brain
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
once
there
,
it
remain
there
;
and
harden
into
a
purpose
than
which
I
have
never
entertain
a
more
determined
purpose
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
far
from
sure
that
I
believe
there
be
anything
hopeful
in
it
,
but
my
mind
be
thoroughly
make
up
that
it
must
be
carry
into
execution
.
   
<EOS>
again
,
and
again
,
and
a
hundred
time
again
,
since
the
night
when
the
thought
have
first
occur
to
me
and
banish
sleep
,
I
have
go
over
that
old
story
of
my
poor
mother
<EOS>
be
about
my
birth
,
which
it
have
be
one
of
my
great
delight
in
the
old
time
to
hear
her
tell
,
and
<EOS>
which
I
know
by
heart
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
walk
into
that
story
,
and
walk
out
of
it
,
a
dread
and
awful
personage
;
but
there
be
one
little
trait
in
her
behaviour
which
I
like
to
dwell
on
,
and
which
give
me
some
faint
shadow
of
encouragement
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
forget
how
my
mother
have
think
that
she
feel
her
touch
her
pretty
hair
with
no
ungentle
hand
;
and
though
it
may
have
be
altogether
my
mother
's
fancy
,
and
may
have
have
no
foundation
whatever
in
fact
,
I
make
a
little
picture
,
out
of
it
,
of
my
terrible
aunt
relent
towards
the
girlish
beauty
that
I
recollect
so
well
and
love
so
much
,
which
soften
the
whole
narrative
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
possible
that
it
have
be
in
my
mind
a
long
time
,
and
have
gradually
engender
my
determination
.
   
<EOS>
as
I
do
not
even
know
where
Miss
Betsey
live
,
I
write
a
long
letter
to
Peggotty
,
and
ask
her
,
incidentally
,
if
she
remember
;
pretend
that
I
have
hear
of
such
a
lady
live
at
a
certain
place
I
name
at
random
,
and
have
a
curiosity
to
know
if
it
be
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
that
letter
,
I
tell
Peggotty
that
I
have
a
particular
occasion
for
half
a
guinea
;
and
that
if
she
could
lend
me
that
sum
until
I
could
repay
it
,
I
should
be
very
much
oblige
to
her
,
and
would
tell
her
afterwards
what
I
have
want
it
for
.
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
's
answer
soon
arrive
,
and
be
,
as
usual
,
full
of
affectionate
devotion
.
 
<EOS>
She
enclose
the
half
guinea
(
I
be
afraid
she
must
have
have
a
world
of
trouble
to
get
it
out
of
Mr
Barkis
's
box
)
,
and
tell
me
that
Miss
Betsey
live
near
Dover
,
but
whether
at
Dover
itself
,
at
Hythe
,
sandgate
,
or
folkestone
,
she
could
not
say
.
<EOS>
one
of
our
man
,
however
,
inform
me
on
my
ask
him
about
these
place
,
that
they
be
all
close
together
,
I
deem
this
enough
for
my
object
,
and
resolve
to
set
out
at
the
end
of
that
week
.
   
<EOS>
be
a
very
honest
little
creature
,
and
unwilling
to
disgrace
the
memory
I
be
go
to
leave
behind
me
at
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
,
I
consider
myself
bind
to
remain
until
Saturday
night
;
and
,
as
I
have
be
pay
a
week
's
wage
in
advance
when
I
first
come
there
,
not
to
present
myself
in
the
counting
-
house
at
the
usual
hour
,
to
receive
my
stipend
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
express
reason
,
I
have
borrow
the
half
-
guinea
,
that
I
may
not
be
without
a
fund
for
my
travelling
-
expense
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
when
the
Saturday
night
come
,
and
we
be
all
wait
in
the
warehouse
to
be
pay
,
and
Tipp
the
carman
,
who
always
take
precedence
,
go
in
first
to
draw
his
money
,
I
shake
Mick
Walker
by
the
hand
;
ask
him
,
when
it
come
to
his
turn
to
be
pay
,
to
say
to
Mr
Quinion
that
I
have
go
to
move
my
box
to
Tipp
's
;
and
,
bid
a
last
good
night
to
Mealy
Potatoes
,
run
away
.
   
<EOS>
My
box
be
at
my
old
lodging
,
over
the
water
,
and
I
have
write
a
direction
for
it
on
the
back
of
one
of
our
address
card
that
we
nail
on
the
cask
:
<EOS>
"
Master
David
,
to
be
leave
till
call
for
,
at
the
Coach
Office
,
Dover
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
I
have
in
my
pocket
ready
to
put
on
the
box
,
after
I
should
have
get
it
out
of
the
house
;
and
as
I
go
towards
my
lodging
,
I
look
about
me
for
someone
who
would
help
me
to
carry
it
to
the
booking
-
office
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
long
-
legged
young
man
with
a
very
little
empty
donkey
-
cart
,
stand
near
the
Obelisk
,
in
the
Blackfriars
Road
,
whose
eye
I
catch
as
I
be
go
by
,
and
who
,
address
me
as
"
Sixpenn'orth
of
bad
ha'pence
,
"
hope
"
I
should
know
him
agin
to
swear
to
"
---
in
allusion
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
to
my
staring
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
stop
to
assure
him
that
I
have
not
do
so
in
bad
manner
,
but
uncertain
whether
he
may
or
may
not
like
a
job
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
job
?
"
say
the
long
-
legged
young
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
to
move
a
box
,
"
I
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
box
?
"
say
the
long
-
legged
young
man
.
   
<EOS>
I
tell
him
mine
,
which
be
down
that
street
there
,
and
which
I
want
him
to
take
to
the
Dover
coach
office
for
sixpence
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
with
you
for
a
tanner
!
"
say
the
long
-
legged
young
man
,
and
directly
get
upon
his
cart
,
which
be
nothing
but
a
large
wooden
tray
on
wheel
,
and
rattle
away
at
such
a
rate
,
that
it
be
as
much
as
I
could
do
to
keep
pace
with
the
donkey
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
defiant
manner
about
this
young
man
,
and
particularly
about
the
way
in
which
he
chew
straw
as
he
speak
to
me
,
that
I
do
not
much
like
;
as
the
bargain
be
make
,
however
,
I
take
him
upstairs
to
the
room
I
be
leave
,
and
we
bring
the
box
down
,
and
put
it
on
his
cart
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
I
be
unwilling
to
put
the
direction
-
card
on
there
,
lest
any
of
my
landlord
's
family
should
fathom
what
I
be
do
,
and
detain
me
;
so
I
say
to
the
young
man
that
I
would
be
glad
if
he
would
stop
for
a
minute
,
when
he
come
to
the
dead
-
wall
of
the
King
's
Bench
prison
.
 
<EOS>
the
word
be
no
sooner
out
of
my
mouth
,
than
he
rattle
away
as
if
he
,
my
box
,
the
cart
,
and
the
donkey
,
be
all
equally
mad
;
and
I
be
quite
out
of
breath
with
run
and
call
after
him
,
when
I
catch
him
at
the
place
appoint
.
   
<EOS>
be
much
flush
and
excited
,
I
tumble
my
half
-
guinea
out
of
my
pocket
in
pull
the
card
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
it
in
my
mouth
for
safety
,
and
though
my
hand
tremble
a
good
deal
,
have
just
tie
the
card
on
very
much
to
my
satisfaction
,
when
I
feel
myself
violently
chuck
under
the
chin
by
the
long
-
legged
young
man
,
and
see
my
half
-
guinea
fly
out
of
my
mouth
into
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wot

<EOS>
"
say
the
young
man
,
seize
me
by
my
jacket
collar
,
with
a
frightful
grin
.
 
<EOS>
"

I
cry
,
burst
into
tear
.
   
<EOS>
the
young
man
still
reply
:
"
come
to
the
pollis
!
"
and
be
drag
me
against
the
donkey
in
a
violent
manner
,
as
if
there
be
any
affinity
between
that
animal
and
a
magistrate
,
when
he
change
his
mind
,
jump
into
the
cart
,
sit
upon
my
box
,
and
,
exclaim
that
he
would
drive
to
the
pollis
straight
,
rattle
away
harder
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
I
run
after
him
as
fast
as
I
could
,
but
I
have
no
breath
to
call
out
with
,
and
should
not
have
dare
to
call
out
,
now
,
if
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
I
narrowly
escape
be
run
over
,
twenty
time
at
least
,
in
half
a
mile
.
 
<EOS>
now
I
lose
him
,
now
I
see
him
,
now
I
lose
him
,
now
I
be
cut
at
with
a
whip
,
now
shout
at
,
now
down
in
the
mud

now
up
again
,
now
run
into
somebody

now
run
headlong
at

<EOS>
at
length
,
confuse
by
fright
and
heat
,
and
doubt
whether
half
London
may
not
by
this
time
be
turn
out
for
my
apprehension
,
I
leave
the
young
man
to
go
where
he
would
with
my
box
and
money
;
and
,
pant
and
cry
,
but
never
stop
,
face
about
for
Greenwich
,
which
I
have
understand
be
on
the
Dover
Road
:
take
very
little
more
out
of
the
world
,
towards
the
retreat
of
my
aunt
,
Miss
Betsey
,
than
I
have
bring
into

on

night
when
my

so
much
umbrage

Chapter
13
.
<EOS>
the
sequel
of
my
resolution
 
for
anything
I
know
,
I
may
have
have
some
wild
idea
of
run
all
the
way
to
Dover
,
when
I
give
up
the
pursuit
of
the
young
man
with
the
donkey
-
cart
,
and
start
for
Greenwich
.
 
<EOS>
My
scatter
sense
be
soon
collect
as
to
that
point
,
if
I
have
;
for
I
come
to
a
stop
in
the
Kent
Road
,
at
a
terrace
with
a
piece
of
water
before
it
,
and
a
great
foolish
image
in
the
middle
,
blow
a
dry
shell
.
<EOS>
here
I
sit
down
on
a
doorstep
,
quite
spend
and
exhaust
with
the
effort
I
have
already
make
,
and
with
hardly
breath
enough
to
cry
for
the
loss
of
my
box
and
half
-
guinea
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
by
this
time
dark
<EOS>
;
I
hear
the
clock
strike
ten
,
as
I
sit
rest
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
a
summer
night
,
fortunately
,
and
fine
weather
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
recover
my
breath
,
and
have
get
rid
of
a
stifle
sensation
in
my
throat
,
I
rise
up
and
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
my
distress
,
I
have
no
notion
of
go
back
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
if
I
should
have
have
any
,
though
there
have
be
a
swiss
snow
-
drift
in
the
Kent
Road
.
   
<EOS>
but
my
standing
possess
of
only
three
-
halfpence
in
the
world
(
and
I
be
sure
I
wonder
how
they
come
to
be
leave
in
my
pocket
on
a
Saturday
night
!
)
<EOS>
trouble
me
none
the
less
because
I
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
picture
to
myself
,
as
a
scrap
of
newspaper
intelligence
,
my
being
find
dead
in
a
day
or
two
,
under
some
hedge
;
and
I
trudge
on
miserably
,
though
as
fast
as
I
could
,
until
I
happen
to
pass
a
little
shop
,
where
it
be
write
up
that
lady
'
and
gentleman
's
wardrobe
be
buy
,
and
that
the
good
price
be
give
for
rag
,
bone
,
and
kitchen
-
stuff
.
 
<EOS>
the
master
of
this
shop
be
sit
at
the
door
in
his
shirt
-
sleeve
,
smoke
;
and
as
there
be
a
great
many
coat
and
pair
of
trouser
dangle
from
the
low
ceiling
,
and
<EOS>
only
two
feeble
candle
burn
inside
to
show
what
they
be
,
I
fancy
that
he
look
like
a
man
of
a
revengeful
disposition
,
who
have
hang
all
his
enemy
,
and
be
enjoy
himself
.
   
<EOS>
My
late
experience
with
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
suggest
to
me
that
here
may
be
a
means
of
keep
off
the
wolf
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
I
go
up
the
next
by
-
street
,
take
off
my
waistcoat
,
roll
it
neatly
under
my
arm
,
and
come
back
to
the
shop
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
you
please
,
sir
,
"
I
say
,
"
I
be
to
sell
this
for
a
fair
price
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dolloby
<EOS>
---
Dolloby
be
the
name
over
the
shop
door
,
at
least
---
take
the
waistcoat
,
stand
his
pipe
on
its
head
,
against
the
door
-
post
,
go
into
the
shop
,
follow
by
me
,
snuff
the
two
candle
with
his
finger
,
spread
the
waistcoat
on
the
counter
,
and
look
at
it
there
,
hold
it
up
against
the
light
,
and
look
at
it
there
,
and
ultimately
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
what
do
you
call
a
price
,
now
,
for
this
here
little
weskit
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
you
know
best
,
sir
,
"
I
return
modestly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
be
buyer
and
seller
too
,
"
say
Mr
Dolloby
.
 
<EOS>
"
put
a
price
on
this
here
little
weskit
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
eighteenpence
be
?
"
<EOS>
---
I
hint
,
after
some
hesitation
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dolloby
roll
it
up
again
,
and
give
it
me
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
rob
my
family
,
"
he
say
,
"
if
I
be
to
offer
ninepence
for
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
this
be
a
disagreeable
way
of
put
the
business
;
because
it
impose
upon
me
,
a
perfect
stranger
,
the
unpleasantness
of
ask
Mr
Dolloby
to
rob
his
family
on
my
account
.
 
<EOS>
My
circumstance
be
so
very
pressing
,
however
,
I
say
I
would
take
ninepence
for
it
,
if
he
please
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dolloby
,
not
without
some
grumbling
,
give
ninepence
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
him
good
night
,
and
walk
out
of
the
shop
the
rich
by
that
sum
,
and
the
poor
by
a
waistcoat
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
I
button
my
jacket
,
that
be
not
much
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
foresaw
pretty
clearly
that
my
jacket
would
go
next
,
and
that
I
should
have
to
make
the
good
of
my
way
to
Dover
in
a
shirt
and
a
pair
of
trouser
,
and
may
deem
myself
lucky
if
I
get
there
even
in
that
trim
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
mind
do
not
run
so
much
on
this
as
may
be
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
beyond
a
general
impression
of
the
distance
before
me
,
and
of
the
young
man
with
the
donkey
-
cart
have
use
me
cruelly
,
I
think
I
have
no
very
urgent
sense
of
my
difficulty
when
I
once
again
set
off
with
my
ninepence
in
my
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
a
plan
have
occur
to
me
for
pass
the
night
,
which
I
be
go
to
carry
into
execution
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
,
to
lie
behind
the
wall
at
the
back
of
my
old
school
,
in
a
corner
where
there
use
to
be
a
haystack
.
 
<EOS>
I
imagine
it
would
be
a
kind
of
company
to
have
the
boy
,
and
the
bedroom
where
I
use
to
tell
the
story
,
so
near
me
:
although
the
boy
would
know
nothing
of
my
be
there
,
and
the
bedroom
would
yield
me
no
shelter
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
have
a
hard
day
's
work
,
and
be
pretty
well
jade
when
I
come
climb
out
,
at
last
,
upon
the
level
of
Blackheath
.
 
<EOS>
It
cost
me
some
trouble
to
find
out
Salem
House
;
but
I
find
it
,
and
I
find
a
haystack
in
the
corner
,
and
I
lie
down
by
it
;
have
first
walk
round
the
wall
,
and
look
up
at
the
window
,
and
see
that
all
be
dark
and
silent
within
.
 
<EOS>
never
shall
I
forget
the
lonely
sensation
of
first
lie
down
,
without
a
roof
above
my
head
!
   
<EOS>
sleep
come
upon
me
as
it
come
on
many
other
outcast
,
against
whom
house
-
door
be
lock
,
and
house
-
dogs
bark
,
that
night
---
and
I
dream
of
lie
on
my
old
school
-
bed
,
talk
to
the
boy
in
my
room
;
and
find
myself
sit
upright
,
with
Steerforth
's
name
upon
my
lip
,
look
wildly
at
the
star
that
be
glisten
and
glimmer
above
me
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
remember
where
I
be
at
that
untimely
hour
,
a
feeling
stole
upon
me
that
make
me
get
up
,
afraid
of
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
,
and
walk
about
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
fainter
glimmering
of
the
star
,
and
the
pale
light
in
the
sky
where
the
day
be
come
,
reassure
me
:
and
<EOS>
my
eye
be
very
heavy
,
I
lie
down
again
and
sleep
---
<EOS>
though
with
a
knowledge
in
my
sleep
that
it
be
cold
---
until
the
warm
beam
of
the
sun
,
and
the
ringing
of
the
get
-
up
bell
at
Salem
House
,
awake
me
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
could
have
hope
that
Steerforth
be
there
,
I
would
have
lurk
about
until
he
come
out
alone
;
but
I
know
he
must
have
leave
long
since
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
still
remain
,
perhaps
,
but
it
be
very
doubtful
;
and
I
have
not
sufficient
confidence
in
his
discretion
or
good
luck
,
however
strong
my
reliance
be
on
his
good
nature
,
to
wish
to
trust
him
with
my
situation
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
creep
away
from
the
wall
as
Mr
Creakle
's
boy
be
get
up
,
and
strike
into
the
long
dusty
track
which
I
have
first
know
to
be
the
Dover
Road
when
I
be
one
of
them
,
and
when
I
little
expect
that
any
eye
would
ever
see
me
the
wayfarer
I
be
now
,
upon
it
.
   
<EOS>
what
a
different
Sunday
morning
from
the
old
Sunday
morning
at
Yarmouth
!
 
<EOS>
in
due
time
I
hear
the
church
-
bell
ring
,
as
I
plod
on
;
and
I
meet
people
who
be
go
to
church
;
and
I
pass
a
church
or
two
where
the
congregation
be
inside
,
and
the
sound
of
singing
come
out
into
the
sunshine
,
while
the
beadle
sit
and
cool
himself
in
the
shade
of
the
porch
,
or
stand
beneath
the
yew
-
tree
,
with
his
hand
to
his
forehead
,
glower
at
me
go
by
.
<EOS>
but
the
peace
and
rest
of
the
old
Sunday
morning
be
on
everything
,
except
me
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
difference
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
quite
wicked
in
my
dirt
and
dust
,
with
my
tangled
hair
.
 
<EOS>
but
for
the
quiet
picture
I
have
conjure
up
,
of
my
mother
in
her
youth
and
beauty
,
weeping
by
the
fire
,
and
my
aunt
relent
to
her
<EOS>
,
I
hardly
think
I
should
have
have
the
courage
to
go
on
until
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
always
go
before
me
,
and
I
follow
.
   
<EOS>
I
get
,
that
Sunday
,
through
three
-
and
-
twenty
mile
on
the
straight
road
,
though
not
very
easily
,
for
I
be
new
to
that
kind
of
toil
.
<EOS>
I
see
myself
,
as
evening
close
in
,
come
over
the
bridge
at
Rochester
,
footsore
and
tired
,
and
eat
bread
that
I
have
buy
for
supper
.
 
<EOS>
one
or
two
little
house
,
with
the
notice
,
"
lodging
for
traveller
"
,
hang
out
,
have
tempt
me
;
but
I
be
afraid
of
spend
the
few
penny
I
have
,
and
be
even
more
afraid
of
the
vicious
look
of
the
tramper
I
have
meet
or
overtake
.
 
<EOS>
I
seek
no
shelter
,
therefore
,
but
the
sky
;
and
toil
into
Chatham
,
---
which
,
in
that
night
's
aspect
,
be
a
mere
dream
of
chalk
,
and
drawbridge
,
and
mastless
ship
in
a
muddy
river
,
roof
like
Noah
's
ark
,
---
creep
,
at
last
,
upon
a
sort
of
grass
-
grow
battery
overhang
a
lane
,
where
a
sentry
be
walk
to
and
fro
.
 
<EOS>
here
I
lie
down
,
near
a
cannon
;
and
,
happy
in
the
society
of
the
sentry
's
footstep
,
though
he
know
no
more
of
my
being
above
him
than
the
boy
at
Salem
House
<EOS>
have
know
of
my
lying
by
the
wall
,
sleep
soundly
until
morning
.
   
<EOS>
very
stiff
and
sore
of
foot
I
be
in
the
morning
,
and
quite
dazed
by
the
beating
of
drum
and
marching
of
troop
,
which
seem
to
hem
me
in
on
every
side
when
I
go
down
towards
the
long
narrow
street
.
 
<EOS>
feel
that
I
could
go
but
a
very
little
way
that
day
,
if
I
be
to
reserve
any
strength
for
get
to
my
journey
's
end
,
I
resolve
to
make
the
sale
of
my
jacket
its
principal
business
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
I
take
the
jacket
off
,
that
I
may
learn
to
do
without
it
;
and
carry
it
under
my
arm
,
begin
a
tour
of
inspection
of
the
various
slop
-
shop
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
likely
place
to
sell
a
jacket
in
;
for
the
dealer
in
second
-
hand
clothe
be
numerous
,
and
be
,
generally
speak
,
on
the
look
-
out
for
customer
at
their
shop
door
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
most
of
them
have
,
hang
up
among
their
stock
,
an
officer
's
coat
or
two
,
epaulette
and
all
,
I
be
render
timid
by
the
costly
nature
of
their
dealing
,
and
walk
about
for
a
long
time
without
offer
my
merchandise
to
anyone
.
   
<EOS>
this
modesty
of
mine
direct
my
attention
to
the
marine
-
store
shop
,
and
such
shop
as
Mr
Dolloby
's
,
in
preference
to
the
regular
dealer
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
I
find
one
that
I
think
look
promising
,
at
the
corner
of
a
dirty
lane
,
end
in
an
enclosure
full
of
stinging
-
nettle
,
against
the
paling
of
which
<EOS>
some
second
-
hand
sailor
'
clothe
,
that
seem
to
have
overflow
the
shop
,
be
flutter
among
some
cot
,
and
rusty
gun
,
and
oilskin
hat
,
and
certain
tray
full
of
so
many
old
rusty
key
of
so
many
size
that
they
seem
various
enough
to
open
all
the
door
in
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
into
this
shop
,
which
be
low
and
small
,
and
which
be
darken
rather
than
light
by
a
little
window
,
overhang
with
clothe
,
and
be
descend
into
by
some
step
,
I
go
with
a
palpitate
heart
;
which
be
not
relieve
when
an
ugly
old
man
,
with
the
low
part
of
his
face
all
cover
with
a
stubbly
grey
beard
,
rush
out
of
a
dirty
den
behind
it
,
and
seize
me
by
the
hair
of
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
dreadful
old
man
to
look
at
,
in
a
filthy
flannel
waistcoat
,
and
smell
terribly
of
rum
.
 
<EOS>
His
bedstead
,
cover
with
a
tumbled
and
ragged
piece
of
patchwork
,
be
in
the
den
he
have
come
from
,
where
another
little
window
show
a
prospect
of
more
stinging
-
nettle
,
and
a
lame
donkey
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
what
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
grin
this
old
man
,
in
a
fierce
,
monotonous
whine
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
my
eye
and
limb
,
what
do
you
want
?
 
<EOS>
oh
,
my
lung
and
liver
,
what
do
you
want
?
 
<EOS>
oh
,
goroo
,
goroo
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
so
much
dismay
by
these
word
,
and
particularly
by
the
repetition
of
the
last
unknown
one
,
which
be
a
kind
of
rattle
in
his
throat
,
that
I
could
make
no
answer
;
<EOS>
hereupon
the
old
man
,
still
hold
me
by
the
hair
,
repeat
:
   
"
<EOS>
oh
,
what
do
you
want
?
 
<EOS>
oh
,
my
eye
and
limb
,
what
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
oh
,
my
lung
and
liver
,
what
do
you
want
?
 
<EOS>
oh
,
goroo
!
"
<EOS>
---
which
he
screw
out
of
himself
,
with
an
energy
that
make
his
eye
start
in
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
know
,
"
I
say
,
tremble
,
"
if
you
would
buy
a
jacket
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
let
's
see
the
jacket
!
"
cry
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
my
heart
on
fire
,
show
the
jacket
to
us
!
 
<EOS>
oh
,
my
eye
and
limb
,
bring
the
jacket
out
!
"
   
<EOS>
with
that
he
take
his
tremble
hand
,
which
be
like
the
claws
of
a
great
bird
,
out
of
my
hair
;
and
put
on
a
pair
of
spectacle
,
not
at
all
ornamental
to
his
inflame
eye
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
how
much
for
the
jacket
?
"
cry
the
old
man
,
after
examine
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
---
goroo
!
<EOS>
---
how
much
for
the
jacket
?
"
   
"
half
-
a
-
crown
,
"
I
answer
,
recover
myself
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
my
lung
and
liver
,
"
cry
the
old
man
,
"
no
!
 
<EOS>
oh
,
my
eye
,
no
!
<EOS>
oh
,
my
limb
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
eighteenpence
.
 
<EOS>
Goroo
!
"
   
<EOS>
every
time
he
utter
this
ejaculation
,
his
eye
seem
to
be
in
danger
of
start
out
;
and
every
sentence
he
speak
,
he
deliver
in
a
sort
of
tune
,
always
exactly
the
same
,
and
more
like
a
gust
of
wind
,
which
begin
low
,
mount
up
high
,
and
fall
again
,
than
any
other
comparison
I
can
find
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
"
say
I
,
glad
to
have
close
the
bargain
,
"
I
will
take
eighteenpence
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
my
liver
!
<EOS>
"
cry
the
old
man
,
throw
the
jacket
on
a
shelf
.
"
<EOS>
get
out
of
the
shop
!
 
<EOS>
oh
,
my
lung
,
get
out
of
the
shop
!
 
<EOS>
oh
,
my
eye
and
limb
---
goroo
!
<EOS>
---
do
not
ask
for
money
;
make
it
an
exchange
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
never
be
so
frightened
in
my
life
,
before
or
since
;
but
I
tell
him
humbly
that
I
want
money
,
and
that
nothing
else
be
of
any
use
to
me
,
but
that
I
would
wait
for
it
,
as
he
desire
,
outside
,
and
have
no
wish
to
hurry
him
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
go
outside
,
and
sit
down
in
the
shade
in
a
corner
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
sit
there
so
many
hour
,
that
the
shade
become
sunlight
,
and
the
sunlight
become
shade
again
,
and
still
I
sit
there
wait
for
the
money
.
   
<EOS>
there
never
be
such
another
drunken
madman
in
that
line
of
business
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
be
well
know
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
enjoy
the
reputation
of
have
sell
himself
to
the
devil
<EOS>
,
I
soon
understand
from
the
visit
he
receive
from
the
boy
,
who
continually
come
skirmish
about
the
shop
,
shout
that
legend
,
and
call
to
him
to
bring
out
his
gold
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
poor
,
you
know
,
Charley
,
as
you
pretend
.
 
<EOS>
bring
out
your
gold
.
 
<EOS>
bring
out
some
of
the
gold
you
sell
yourself
to
the
devil
for
.
 
<EOS>
Come
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
lining
of
the
mattress
,
Charley
.
 
<EOS>
rip
it
open
and
let
's
have
some
!
"
 
<EOS>
this
,
and
many
offer
to
lend
him
a
knife
for
the
purpose
,
exasperate
him
to
such
a
degree
,
that
the
whole
day
be
a
succession
of
rush
on
his
part
,
and
flight
on
the
part
of
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
in
his
rage
he
would
take
me
for
one
of
them
,
and
come
at
me
,
mouth
as
if
he
be
go
to
tear
me
in
piece
;
then
,
remember
me
,
just
in
time
,
would
dive
into
the
shop
,
and
lie
upon
his
bed
,
as
I
think
from
the
sound
of
his
voice
,
yell
in
a
frantic
way
,
to
his
own
windy
tune
,
the
"
Death
of
Nelson
"
;
with
an
oh
!
<EOS>
before
every
line
,
and
innumerable
Goroos
intersperse
.
<EOS>
as
if
this
be
not
bad
enough
for
me
,
the
boy
,
connect
me
with
the
establishment
,
on
account
of
the
patience
and
perseverance
with
which
I
sit
outside
,
half
-
dressed
,
pelt
me
,
and
use
me
very
ill
all
day
.
   
<EOS>
He
make
many
attempt
to
induce
me
to
consent
to
an
exchange
;
at
one
time
come
out
with
a
fishing
-
rod
,
at
another
with
a
fiddle
,
at
another
with
a
cocked
hat
,
at
another
with
a
flute
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
resist
all
these
overture
,
and
sit
there
in
desperation
;
each
time
ask
him
,
with
tear
in
my
eye
,
for
my
money
or
my
jacket
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
begin
to
pay
me
in
halfpence
at
a
time
;
and
be
full
two
hour
get
by
easy
stage
to
a
shilling
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
my
eye
and
limb
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
then
cry
,
peep
hideously
out
of
the
shop
,
after
a
long
pause
,
"
will
you
go
for
twopence
more
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
,
"
I
say
;
"
I
shall
be
starve
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
my
lung
and
liver
,
will
you
go
for
threepence
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
go
for
nothing
,
if
I
could
,
"
I
say
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
want
the
money
badly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
go
-
roo
!
"
<EOS>
(
it
be
really
impossible
to
express
how
he
twist
this
ejaculation
out
of
himself
,
as
he
peep
round
<EOS>
the
door
-
post
at
me
,
show
nothing
but
his
crafty
old
head
)
<EOS>
;
"
will
you
go
for
fourpence
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
so
faint
and
weary
that
I
close
with
this
offer
;
and
take
the
money
out
of
his
claw
,
not
without
tremble
,
go
away
more
hungry
and
thirsty
than
I
have
ever
be
,
a
little
before
sunset
.
<EOS>
but
at
an
expense
of
threepence
I
soon
refresh
myself
completely
;
and
,
be
in
well
spirit
then
,
limp
seven
mile
upon
my
road
.
   
<EOS>
My
bed
at
night
be
under
another
haystack
,
where
I
rest
comfortably
,
after
have
wash
my
blister
foot
in
a
stream
,
and
dress
them
as
well
as
I
be
able
,
with
some
cool
leave
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
take
the
road
again
next
morning
,
I
find
that
it
lie
through
a
succession
of
hop
-
ground
and
orchard
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
sufficiently
late
in
the
year
for
the
orchard
to
be
ruddy
with
ripe
apple
;
and
in
a
few
place
the
hop
-
picker
be
already
at
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
all
extremely
beautiful
,
and
make
up
my
mind
to
sleep
among
the
hop
that
night
:
imagine
some
cheerful
companionship
in
the
long
perspective
of
pole
,
with
the
graceful
leave
twine
round
them
.
   
<EOS>
the
tramper
be
bad
than
ever
that
day
,
and
inspire
me
with
a
dread
that
be
yet
quite
fresh
in
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
them
be
most
ferocious
-
look
ruffian
,
who
stare
at
me
as
I
go
by
;
and
stop
,
perhaps
,
and
call
after
me
to
come
back
and
speak
to
them
,
and
when
I
take
to
my
heel
,
stone
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
recollect
one
young
fellow
---
a
tinker
,
I
suppose
,
from
his
wallet
and
brazier
---
who
have
a
woman
with
him
,
and
who
face
about
and
stare
at
me
thus
;
and
then
roar
to
me
in
such
a
tremendous
voice
to
come
back
,
that
I
halt
and
look
round
.
   
<EOS>
"
come
here
,
when
you
be
call
,
"
say
the
tinker
,
"
or
I
will
rip
your
young
body
open
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
think
it
best
to
go
back
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
draw
near
to
them
,
try
to
propitiate
the
tinker
by
my
look
,
I
observe
that
the
woman
have
a
black
eye

give
his

another

more
securely

<EOS>
with
his
disengaged
hand
he
make
a
menace
of
strike
me
,
and
then
look
at
me
from
head
to
foot

<EOS>

<EOS>
I

certainly
have
produce

that
I
meet
the
woman

look
,
and
see
her
very
slightly
shake
her
head
,
and
form
"
no

<EOS>
with
her
lip
.
   
<EOS>
"
I

attempt

and
have
get
no

<EOS>
"
why
,
what
do
you
mean

"
say
the
tinker
,
<EOS>
look
so
sternly
at
me
,
that
I
almost
fear
he
see
the
money
in
my
pocket

<EOS>
"
Sir

I
stammer

"
what

<EOS>
and
he
have
mine
off
my
neck
in
a
moment
,
and
toss
it
to
the
woman
.
   
<EOS>
the
woman
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
,
as
if
she
think
this
a
joke
,
and
toss
it
back
to
me
,
nod
once
,
as
slightly
as
before
,
and
make
the
word
"
go
!
"
<EOS>
with
her
lip
.
 
<EOS>
before
I
could
obey
,
however
,
the
tinker
seize
the
handkerchief
out
of
my
hand
with
a
roughness
that
throw
me
away
like
a
feather
,
and
put
it
loosely
round
his
own
neck
,
turn
upon
the
woman
with
an
oath
,
and
knock
her
down
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
shall
forget
see
her
fall
backward
on
the
hard
road
,
and
lie
there
with
her
bonnet
tumble
off
,
and
her
hair
all
whiten
in
the
dust
;
nor
,
when
I
look
back
from
a
distance
,
see
her
sit
on
the
pathway
,
which
be
a
bank
by
the
roadside
,
wipe
the
blood
from
her
face
with
a
corner
of
her
shawl
,
while
he
go
on
ahead
.
   
<EOS>
this
adventure
frighten
me
so
,
that
,
afterwards
,
when
I
see
any
of
these
people
come
,
I
turn
back
until
I
could
find
a
hiding
-
place
,
where
I
remain
until
they
have
go
out
of
sight
;
which
happen
so
often
,
that
I
be
very
seriously
delay
.
 
<EOS>
but
under
this
difficulty
,
as
under
all
the
other
difficulty
of
my
journey
,
I
seem
to
be
sustain
and
lead
on
by
my
fanciful
picture
of
my
mother
in
her
youth
,
before
I
come
into
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
It
always
keep
me
company
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
there
,
among
the
hop
,
when
I
lie
down
to
sleep
;
it
be
with
me
on
my
waking
in
the
morning
;
it
go
before
me
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
associate
it
,
ever
since
,
with
the
sunny
street
of
Canterbury
,
doze
as
it
be
in
the
hot
light
;
and
with
the
sight
of
its
old
house
and
gateway
,
and
the
stately
,
grey
Cathedral
,
with
the
rook
sailing
round
the
tower
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
come
,
at
last
,
upon
the
bare
,
wide
down
near
Dover
,
it
relieve
the
solitary
aspect
of
the
scene
with
hope
;
and
not
until
I
reach
that
first
great
aim
of
my
journey
,
and
actually
set
foot
in
the
town
itself
,
on
the
sixth
day
of
my
flight
,
do
it
desert
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
then
,
strange
to
say
,
when
I
stand
with
my
ragged
shoe
,
and
my
dusty
,
sunburnt
,
half
-
clothe
figure
,
in
the
place
so
long
desire
,
it
seem
to
vanish
like
a
dream
,
and
to
leave
me
helpless
and
dispirited
.
   
<EOS>
I
inquire
about
my
aunt
among
the
boatman
first
,
and
receive
various
answer
.
 
<EOS>
one
say
she
live
in
the
South
Foreland
Light
,
and
have
singe
her
whisker
by
do
so
;
another
,
that
she
be
make
fast
to
the
great
buoy
outside
the
harbour
,
and
could
only
be
visit
at
half
-
tide
;
a
third
,
that
she
be
lock
up
in
Maidstone
jail
for
child
-
stealing
;
a
fourth
,
that
she
be
see
to
mount
a
broom
in
the
last
high
wind
,
and
make
direct
for
Calais
.
 
<EOS>
the
fly
-
driver
,
among
whom
I
inquire
next
,
be
equally
jocose
and
equally
disrespectful
;
and
the
shopkeeper
,
not
like
my
appearance
,
generally
reply
,
without
hear
what
I
have
to
say
,
that
they
have
get
nothing
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
more
miserable
and
destitute
than
I
have
do
at
any
period
of
my
running
away
.
 
<EOS>
My
money
be
all
go
,
I
have
nothing
leave
to
dispose
of
;
I
be
hungry
,
thirsty
,
and
wear
out
;
and
seem
as
distant
from
my
end
as
if
I
have
remain
in
London
.
   
<EOS>
the
morning
have
wear
away
in
these
inquiry
,
and
I
be
sit
on
the
step
of
an
empty
shop
at
a
street
corner
,
near
the
market
-
place
,
deliberate
upon
wander
towards
those
other
place
which
have
be
mention
,
when
a
fly
-
driver
,
come
by
with
his
carriage
,
drop
a
horsecloth
.
 
<EOS>
something
good
-
natured
in
the
man
's
face
,
as
I
hand
it
up
,
encourage
me
to
ask
him
if
he
could
tell
me
where
Miss
Trotwood
live
;
though
I
have
ask
the
question
so
often
,
that
it
almost
die
upon
my
lip
.
   
<EOS>
"
Trotwood
,
"
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
me
see
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
name
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
old
lady
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
say
,
"
rather
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
pretty
stiff
in
the
back
?
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
make
himself
upright
.
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
it
very
likely
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
carry
a
bag
?
"
<EOS>
say
he
---
"
bag
with
a
good
deal
of
room
in
it
---
be
gruffish
,
and
come
down
upon
you
,
sharp
?
"
   
<EOS>
My
heart
sink
within
me
as
I
acknowledge
the
undoubted
accuracy
of
this
description
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
then
,
I
tell
you
what
,
"
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
go
up
there
,
"
point
with
his
whip
towards
the
height
,
"
and
keep
right
on
till
you
come
to
some
house
face
the
sea
,
I
think
you
will
hear
of
her
.
<EOS>
My
opinion
be
she
will
not
stand
anything
,
so
here
be
a
penny
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
accept
the
gift
thankfully
,
and
buy
a
loaf
with
it
.
<EOS>
dispatch
this
refreshment
by
the
way
,
I
go
in
the
direction
my
friend
have
indicate
,
and
walk
on
a
good
distance
without
come
to
the
house
he
have
mention
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
I
see
some
before
me
;
and
approach
them
,
go
into
a
little
shop
<EOS>
(
it
be
what
we
use
to
call
a
general
shop
,
at
home
)
,
and
inquire
if
they
could
have
the
goodness
to
tell
me
where
Miss
Trotwood
live
.
 
<EOS>
I
address
myself
to
a
man
behind
the
counter
,
who
be
weigh
some
rice
for
a
young
woman
;
but
the
latter
,
take
the
inquiry
to
herself
,
turn
round
quickly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
mistress
?
<EOS>
"
she
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
want
with
her
,
boy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
,
"
I
reply
,
"
to
speak
to
her
,
if
you
please
.
"
   
"
to
beg
of
her
,
you
mean
,
"
retort
the
damsel
.
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
I
say
,
"
indeed
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
suddenly
remember
that
in
truth
I
come
for
no
other
purpose
,
I
hold
my
peace
in
confusion
,
and
feel
my
face
burn
.
   
<EOS>
my
aunt
's
handmaid
,
as
I
suppose
she
be
from
what
she
have
say
,
put
her
rice
in
a
little
basket
and
walk
out
of
the
shop
;
tell
me
that
I
could
follow
her
,
if
I
want
to
know
where
Miss
Trotwood
live
.
 
<EOS>
I
need
no
second
permission
;
though
I
be
by
this
time
in
such
a
state
of
consternation
and
agitation
,
that
my
leg
shake
under
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
follow
the
young
woman
,
and
we
soon
come
to
a
very
neat
little
cottage
with
cheerful
bow
-
window
:
in
front
of
it
,
a
small
square
gravel
court
or
garden
full
of
flower
,
carefully
tend
,
and
smell
deliciously
.
   
<EOS>
"
this
be
Miss
Trotwood
's
,
"
say
the
young
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
now
you
know
;
and
that
be
all
I
have
get
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
with
which
word
she
hurry
into
the
house
,
as
if
to
shake
off
the
responsibility
of
my
appearance
;
and
leave
me
stand
at
the
garden
-
gate
,
look
disconsolately
over
the
top
of
it
towards
the
parlour
window
,
where
a
muslin
curtain
partly
undrawn
in
the
middle
,
a
large
round
green
screen
or
fan
fasten
on
to
the
windowsill
,
a
small
table
,
and
a
great
chair
,
suggest
to
me
that
my
aunt
may
be
at
that
moment
seat
in
awful
state
.
   
<EOS>
My
shoe
be
by
this
time
in
a
woeful
condition
.
 
<EOS>
the
sol
have
shed
themselves
bit
by
bit
,
and
the
upper
leather
have
break
and
burst
until
the
very
shape
and
form
of
shoe
have
depart
from
them
.
 
<EOS>
My
hat
(
which
have
serve
me
for
a
night
-
cap
,
too
)
be
so
crushed
and
bent
,
that
no
old
battered
handleless
saucepan
on
a
dunghill
need
have
be
ashamed
to
vie
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
shirt
and
trouser
,
stain
with
heat
,
dew
,
grass
,
and
the
kentish
soil
on
which
I
have
sleep
---
and
tear
besides
---
may
have
frighten
the
bird
from
my
aunt
's
garden
,
as
I
stand
at
the
gate
.
 
<EOS>
My
hair
have
know
no
comb
or
brush
since
I
leave
London
.
 
<EOS>
My
face
,
neck
,
and
hand
,
from
unaccustomed
exposure
to
the
air
and
sun
,
be
burn
to
a
berry
-
brown
.
 
<EOS>
from
head
to
foot
I
be
powder
almost
as
white
with
chalk
and
dust
,
as
if
I
have
come
out
of
a
lime
-
kiln
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
plight
,
and
with
a
strong
consciousness
of
it
,
I
wait
to
introduce
myself
to
,
and
make
my
first
impression
on
,
my
formidable
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
the
unbroken
stillness
of
the
parlour
window
lead
me
to
infer
,
after
a
while
,
that
she
be
not
there
,
I
lift
up
my
eye
to
the
window
above
it
,
where
I
see
a
florid
,
pleasant
-
look
gentleman
,
with
a
grey
head
,
who
shut
up
one
eye
in
a
grotesque
manner
,
nod
his
head
at
me
several
time
,
shake
it
at
me
as
often
,
laugh
,
and
go
away
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
be
discompose
enough
before
;
but
I
be
so
much
the
more
discompose
by
this
unexpected
behaviour
,
that
I
be
on
the
point
of
slink
off
,
to
think
how
I
have
good
proceed
,
when
there
come
out
of
the
house
a
lady
with
her
handkerchief
tie
over
her
cap
,
and
a
pair
of
gardening
glove
on
her
hand
,
wear
a
gardening
pocket
like
a
toll
-
man
's
apron
,
and
carry
a
great
knife
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
her
immediately
to
be
Miss
Betsey
,
for
she
come
stalk
out
of
the
house
exactly
as
my
poor
mother
have
so
often
describe
her
stalk
up
our
garden
at
Blunderstone
Rookery
.
   
<EOS>
"
go
away
!
"
say
Miss
Betsey
,
shake
her
head
,
and
make
a
distant
chop
in
the
air
with
her
knife
.
 
<EOS>
"
go
along
!
 
<EOS>
no
boy
here
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
watch
her
,
with
my
heart
at
my
lip
,
as
she
march
to
a
corner
of
her
garden
,
and
stoop
to
dig
up
some
little
root
there
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
without
a
scrap
of
courage
,
but
with
a
great
deal
of
desperation
,
I
go
softly
in
and
stand
beside
her
,
touch
her
with
my
finger
.
   
<EOS>
"
if

She

exclaim
Miss

in

I

way
all
at
once
;
and
with
a
movement
of
my
hand
,
intend
to
show
her
my
ragged
state
,
and
call
it
to
witness
that
I
have
suffer
something
,
I
break
into
a
passion
of
crying
,
which
I
suppose
have
be
pen
up
within
me
all
the
week
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
with
every
sort
of
expression
but
wonder
discharge
from
her
countenance
,
sit
on
the
gravel
,
stare
at
me
,
until
I
begin
to
cry
;
when
she
get
up
in
a
great
hurry
,
collar
me
,
and
take
me
into
the
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
Her
first
proceeding
<EOS>
there
be
to
unlock
a
tall
press
,
bring
out
several
bottle
,
and
pour
some
of
the
content
of
each
into
my
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
they
must
have
be
take
out
at
random
,
for
I
be
sure
I
taste
aniseed
water
,
anchovy
sauce
,
and
salad
dressing
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
have
administer
these
restorative
,
as
I
be
still
quite
hysterical
,
and
unable
to
control
my
sobs
,
she
put
me
on
the
sofa
,
with
a
shawl
under
my
head
,
and
the
handkerchief
from
her
own
head
under
my
foot
,
lest
I
should
sully
the
cover
;
and
then
,
sit
herself
down
behind
the
green
fan
or
screen
I
have
already
mention
,
so
that
I
could
not
see
her
face
,
ejaculate
at
interval
,
"
mercy
on
us
!
"
<EOS>
let
those
exclamation
off
like
minute
gun
.
   
<EOS>
after
a
time
she
ring
the
bell
.
 
<EOS>
"
Janet
,
"
say
my
aunt
,
when
her
servant
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
"
go
upstairs
,
give
my
compliment
to
Mr
Dick
,
and
say
I
wish
to
speak
to
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Janet
look
a
little
surprised
to
see
me
lie
stiffly
on
the
sofa
<EOS>
(
I
be
afraid
to
move
lest
it
should
be
displeasing
to
my
aunt
)
,
but
go
on
her
errand
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
with
her
hand
behind
her
,
walk
up
and
down
the
room
,
until
the
gentleman
who
have
squint
at
me
from
the
upper
window
come
in
laughing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dick
,
"
say
my
aunt
,
"
do
not
be
a
fool
,
because
nobody
can
be
more
discreet
than
you
can

when
you
choose

<EOS>
We
all
know
that

<EOS>
so
do
not

whatever
you
be

"
   
<EOS>
the
gentleman
be
serious
immediately
,
and
look
at
me
,
I
think
,
as
if
he
would
entreat
me
to
say
nothing
about
the
window
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dick
,
"
say
my
aunt
,
"
you

hear
me

<EOS>
"

my

He

His

His

My

nowhere

Mr

<EOS>
"
well

return
my

soften
by
the
reply

"
how

now

here

come

I
want
some
very
sound

"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
if
I
be
you

"
say
Mr

consider
,
and
look
vacantly
at
me
,
"
I
should
---
<EOS>
"
the
contemplation
of
me
seem
to
inspire
him
with
a
sudden
idea
,
and
he
add
,
briskly
,
"
I
should
wash
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Janet
,
"
say
my
aunt
,
turn
round
with
a
quiet
triumph
,
which
I
do
not
then
understand
,
"
Mr
Dick
set
us
all
right
.
 
<EOS>
heat
the
bath
!
"
   
<EOS>
although
I
be
deeply
interested
in
this
dialogue
,
I
could
not
help
observe
my
aunt
,
Mr
Dick
,
and
Janet
,
while
it
be
in
progress
,
and
complete
a
survey
I
have
already
be
engage
in
making
of
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
my
aunt
be
a
tall
,
hard
-
feature
lady
,
but
by
no
means
ill
-
looking
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
inflexibility
in
her
face
,
in
her
voice
,
in
her
gait
and
carriage
,
amply
sufficient
to
account
for
the
effect
she
have
make
upon
a
gentle
creature
like
my
mother
;
but
her
feature
be
rather
handsome
than
otherwise
,
though
unbend
and
austere
.
 
<EOS>
I
particularly
notice
that
she
have
a
very
quick
,
bright
eye
.
 
<EOS>
Her
hair
,
which
be
grey
,
be
arrange
in
two
plain
division
,
under
what
I
believe
would
be
call
a
mob
-
cap
;
I
mean
a
cap
,
much
more
common
then
than
now
,
with
side
-
piece
fasten
under
the
chin
.
 
<EOS>
Her
dress
be
of
a
lavender
colour
,
and
perfectly
neat
;
but
scantily
make
,
as
if
she
desire
to
be
as
little
encumber
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
that
I
think
it
,
in
form
,
more
like
a
riding
-
habit
with
the
superfluous
skirt
cut
off
,
than
anything
else
.
 
<EOS>
She
wear
at
her
side
a
gentleman
's
gold
watch
,
if
I
may
judge
from
its
size
and
make
,
with
an
appropriate
chain
and
seal
;
she
have
some
linen
at
her
throat
not
unlike
a
shirt
-
collar
,
and
thing
at
her
wrist
like
little
shirt
-
wristband
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
,
as
I
have
already
say
,
be
grey
-
head
,
and
florid
<EOS>
:
I
should
have
say
all
about
him
,
in
say
so
,
have
not
his
head
be
curiously
bow
---
not
by
age
;
it
remind
me
of
one
of
Mr
Creakle
's
boy
'
head
after
a
beating
---
and
his
grey
eye
prominent
and
large
,
with
a
strange
kind
of
watery
brightness
in
them
that
make
me
,
in
combination
with
his
vacant
manner
,
his
submission
to
my
aunt
,
and
his
childish
delight
when
she
praise
him
,
suspect
him
of
be
a
little
mad
;
though
,
if
he
be
mad
,
how
he
come
to
be
there
puzzle
me
extremely
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
dress
like
any
other
ordinary
gentleman
,
in
a
loose
grey
morning
coat
and
waistcoat
,
and
white
trouser
;
and
have
his
watch
in
his
fob
,
and
his
money
in
his
pocket
:
which
he
rattle
as
if
he
be
very
proud
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
Janet
be
a
pretty
blooming
girl
,
of
about
nineteen
or
twenty
,
and
a
perfect
picture
of
neatness
.
 
<EOS>
though
I
make
no
further
observation
of
her
at
the
moment
,
I
may
mention
here
what
I
do
not
discover
until
afterwards
,
namely
,
that
she
be
one
of
a
series
of
protegee
whom
my
aunt
have
take
into
her
service
expressly
to
educate
in
a
renouncement
of
mankind
,
and
who
have
generally
complete
their
abjuration
by
marry
the
baker
.
   
<EOS>
the
room
be
as
neat
as
Janet
or
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
lay
down
my
pen
,
a
moment
since
,
to
think
of
it
,
the
air
from
the
sea
come
blow
in
again
,
mix
with
the
perfume
of
the
flower
;
and
I
see
the
old
-
fashioned
furniture
brightly
rub
and
polish
,
my
aunt
's
inviolable
chair
and
table
by
the
round
green
fan
in
the
bow
-
window
,
the
drugget
-
cover
carpet
,
the
cat
,
the
kettle
-
holder
,
the
two
canary
,
the
old
china
,
the
punchbowl
full
of
dry
rose
-
leave
,
the
tall
press
guard
all
sort
of
bottle
and
pot
,
and
,
wonderfully
out
of
keep
with
the
rest
,
my
dusty
self
upon
the
sofa
,
take
note
of
everything
.
   
<EOS>
Janet
have
go
away
to
get
the
bath
ready
,
when
my
aunt
,
to
my
great
alarm
,
become
in
one
moment
rigid
with
indignation
,
and
have
hardly
voice
to
cry
out
,
"
Janet
!
 
<EOS>
donkey
!
"
   
<EOS>
upon
which
,
Janet
come
run
up
the
stair
as
if
the
house
be
in
flame
,
dart
out
on
a
little
piece
of
green
in
front
,
and
warn
off
two
saddle
-
donkey
,
lady
-
ride
,
that
have
presume
to
set
hoof
upon
it
;
while
my
aunt
,
rush
out
of
the
house
,
seize
the
bridle
of
a
third
animal
laden
with
a
bestride
child
,
turn
him
,
lead
him
forth
from
those
sacred
precinct
,
and
box
the
ear
of
the
unlucky
urchin
in
attendance
who
have
dare
to
profane
that
hallow
ground
.
   
<EOS>
to
this
hour
I
do
not
know
whether
my
aunt
have
any
lawful
right
of
way
over
that
patch
of
green
;
but
she
have
settle
it
in
her
own
mind
that
she
have
,
and
it
be
all
the
same
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
one
great
outrage
of
her
life
,
demand
to
be
constantly
avenge
,
be
the
passage
of
a
donkey
over
that
immaculate
spot
.
 
<EOS>
in
whatever
occupation
she
be
engage
,
however
interesting
to
her
the
conversation
in
which
she
be
take
part
,
a
donkey
turn
the
current
of
her
idea
in
a
moment
,
and
she
be
upon
him
straight
.
<EOS>
jug
of
water
,
and
watering
-
pot
,
be
keep
in
secret
place
ready
to
be
discharge
on
the
offend
boy
;
stick
be
lay
in
ambush
behind
the
door
;
sally
be
make
at
all
hour
;
and
incessant
war
prevail
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
this
be
an
agreeable
excitement
to
the
donkey
-
boy
;
or
perhaps
the
more
sagacious
of
the
donkey
,
understand
how
the
case
stand
,
delighted
with
constitutional
obstinacy
in
come
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
know
that
there
be
three
alarm
before
the
bath
be
ready
;
and
that
on
the
occasion
of
the
last
and
most
desperate
of
all
,
I
see
my
aunt
engage
,
single
-
handed
,
with
a
sandy
-
head
lad
of
fifteen
,
and
bump
his
sandy
head
against
her
own
gate
,
before
he
seem
to
comprehend
what
be
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
these
interruption
be
of
the
more
ridiculous
to
me
,
because
she
be
give
me
broth
out
of
a
table
-
spoon
at
the
time
(
have
firmly
persuade
herself
that
I
be
actually
starve
,
and
must
receive
nourishment
at
first
in
very
small
quantity
)
,
and
,
while
my
mouth
be
yet
open
to
receive
the
spoon
,
she
would
put
it
back
into
the
basin
,
cry
"
Janet
!
 
donkey
!
"
and
go
out
to
the
assault
.
   
<EOS>
the
bath
be
a
great
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
for
I
begin
to
be
sensible
of
acute
pain
in
my
limb
from
lie
out
in
the
field
,
and
be
now
so
tired
and
low
that
I
could
hardly
keep
myself
awake
for
five
minute
together
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
bathe
,
they
(
I
mean
my
aunt
and
Janet
)
enrobe
me
in
a
shirt
and
a
pair
of
trouser
belong
to
Mr
Dick
,
and
tie
me
up
in
two
or
three
great
shawl
.
 
<EOS>
what
sort
of
bundle
<EOS>
I
look
like
,
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
,
but
I
feel
a
very
hot
one
.
<EOS>
feel
also
very
faint
and
drowsy
,
I
soon
lie
down
on
the
sofa
again
and
fall
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
a
dream
,
originate
in
the
fancy
which
have
occupy
my
mind
so
long
,
but
I
awake
with
the
impression
that
my
aunt
have
come
and
bent
over
me
,
and
have
put
my
hair
away
from
my
face
,
and
lay
my
head
more
comfortably
,
and
have
then
stand
look
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
word
,
"
pretty
fellow
,
"
or
"
poor
fellow
,
"
seem
to
be
in
my
ear
,
too
;
but
certainly
there
be
nothing
else
,
when
I
awake
,
to
lead
me
to
believe
that
they
have
be
utter
by
my
aunt
,
who
sit
in
the
bow
-
window
gazing
at
the
sea
from
behind
the
green
fan
,
which
be
mount
on
a
kind
of
swivel
,
and
turn
any
way
.
   
<EOS>
We
dine
soon
after
I
awake
,
off
a
roast
fowl
and
a
pudding
;
I
sit
at
table
,
not
unlike
a
trussed
bird
myself
,
and
move
my
arm
with
considerable
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
my
aunt
have
swathe
me
up
,
I
make
no
complaint
of
be
inconvenience
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
time
I
be
deeply
anxious
to
know
what
she
be
go
to
do
with
me
;
but
she
take
her
dinner
in
profound
silence
,
except
when
she
occasionally
fix
her
eye
on
me
sit
opposite
,
and
say
,
"
mercy
upon
us
!
"
which
do
not
by
any
mean
relieve
my
anxiety
.
   
<EOS>
the
cloth
be
draw
,
and
some
sherry
put
upon
the
table
(
of

all

me

too

if
I

and
then
,
as

I
could
not

to
hear
my

so
decry

make
the

such

<EOS>
I
tell
my

indeed

most

who

choke

break
down

that
all
she
have
be
mine

and
that
I
would
have
go
to
her

shelter

for
her
humble
station

which
make
me
fear
that
I

<EOS>
I
break
down

I

lay

"

well

"
   
<EOS>
I
thoroughly
believe
that
but
for
those
unfortunate
donkey
,
we
should
have
come
to
a
good
understanding
;
for
my
aunt
have
lay
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
,
and
the
impulse
be
upon
me
,
thus
embolden
,
to
embrace
her
and
beseech
her
protection
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
interruption
,
and
the
disorder
she
be
throw
into
by
the
struggle
outside
,
put
an
end
to
all
soft
idea
for
the
present
,
and
keep
my
aunt
indignantly
declaim
to
Mr
Dick
about
her
determination
to
appeal
for
redress
to
the
law
of
her
country
,
and
to
bring
action
for
trespass
against
the
whole
donkey
proprietorship
of
Dover
,
until
tea
-
time
.
   
<EOS>
after
tea
,
we
sit
at
the
window
---
on
the
look
-
out
,
as
I
imagine
,
from
my
aunt
's
sharp
expression
of
face
,
for
more
invader
---
until
dusk
,
when
Janet
set
candle
,
and
a
backgammon
-
board
,
on
the
table
,
and
pull
down
the
blind
.
   
<EOS>
"
now

Mr

my

up

cry
my
aunt
,
with
the
same
complacent
triumph
that
I
have
remark
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dick
set
us
all
right
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
bed
be
ready

we
will
take
him
up
to
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Janet
report
it
to
be
quite
ready
,
I
be
take
up
to
it
;
kindly
,
but
in
some
sort
like
a
prisoner
;
my
aunt
go
in
front
and
Janet
bring
up
the
rear
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
circumstance
which
give
me
any
new
hope
,
be
my
aunt
's
stop
on
the
stair
to
inquire
about
a
smell
of
fire
that
be
prevalent
there
;
and
janet
's
replying
that
she
have
be
make
tinder
down
in
the
kitchen
,
of
my
old
shirt
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
other
clothe
in
my
room
than
the
odd
heap
of
thing
I
wear
;
and
when
I
be
leave
there
,
with
a
little
taper
which
my
aunt
forewarn
me
would
burn
exactly
five
minute
<EOS>
,
I
hear
them
lock
my
door
on
the
outside
.
 
<EOS>
turn
these
thing
over
in
my
mind
<EOS>
I
deem
it
possible
that
my
aunt
,
who
could
know
nothing
of
me
,
may
suspect
I
have
a
habit
of
run
away
,
and
take
precaution
,
on
that
account
,
to
have
me
in
safe
keeping
.
   
<EOS>
the
room
be
a
pleasant
one
,
at
the
top
of
the
house
,
overlook
the
sea
,
on
which
the
moon
be
shine
brilliantly
.
 
<EOS>
after
I
have
say
my
prayer
,
and
the
candle
have
burn
out
,
I
remember
how
I
still
sit
look
at
the
moonlight
on
the
water
,
as
if
I
could
hope
to
read
my
fortune
in
it
,
as
in
a
bright
book
;
or
to
see
my
mother
with
her
child
,
come
from
Heaven
,
along
that
shine
path
,
to
look
upon
me
as
she
have
look
when
I
last
see
her
sweet
face
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
how
the
solemn
feeling
with
which
at
length
I
turn
my
eye
away
,
yield
to
the
sensation
of
gratitude
and
rest
<EOS>
which
the
sight
of
the
white
-
curtain
bed
---
and
how
much
more
the
lying
softly
down
upon
it
,
nestle
in
the
snow
-
white
sheet
<EOS>
!
<EOS>
---
inspire
.
<EOS>
I
remember
how
I
think
of
all
the
solitary
place
under
the
night
sky
where
I
have
sleep
,
and
how
I
pray
that
I
never
may
be
houseless
any
more
,
and
never
may
forget
the
houseless
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
how
I
seem
to
float
,
then
,
down
the
melancholy
glory
of
that
track
upon
the
sea
,
away
into
the
world
of
dream

Chapter

<EOS>
My
aunt
make
up
her
mind
about
me
 
on
go
down
in
the
morning
,
I
find
my
aunt
muse
so
profoundly
over
the
breakfast
table
,
with
her
elbow
on
the
tray
,
that
the
content
of
the
urn
have
overflow
the
teapot
and
be
lay
the
whole
table
-
cloth
under
water
,
when
my
entrance
put
her
meditation
to
flight
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
that
I
have
be
the
subject
of
her
reflection
,
and
be
more
than
ever
anxious
to
know
her
intention
towards
me
.
 
<EOS>
yet
I
dare
not
express
my
anxiety
,
lest
it
should
give
her
offence
.
   
<EOS>
My
eye
,
however
,
not
be
so
much
under
control
as
my
tongue
,
be
attract
towards
my
aunt
very
often
during
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
could
look
at
her
for
a
few
moment
together
<EOS>
but
I
find
her
look
at
me
---
in
an
odd
thoughtful
manner
,
as
if
I
be
an
immense
way
off
,
instead
of
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
small
round
table
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
have
finish
her
breakfast
,
my
aunt
very
deliberately
lean
back
in
her
chair
,
knit
her
brow
,
fold
her
arm
,
and
contemplate
me
at
her
leisure
,
with
such
a
fixedness
of
attention
that
I
be
quite
overpower
by
embarrassment
.
 
<EOS>
not
have
as
yet
finish
my
own
breakfast
,
I
attempt
to
hide
my
confusion
by
proceed
with
it
;
but
my
knife
tumble
over
my
fork
,
my
fork
trip
up
my
knife
,
I
chip
bit
of
bacon
a
surprising
height
into
the
air
instead
of
cut
them
for
my
own
eating
,
and
choke
myself
with
my
tea
,
which
persist
in
go
the
wrong
way
instead
of
the
right
one
,
until
I
give
in
altogether
,
and
sit
blush
under
my
aunt
's
close
scrutiny
.
   
<EOS>
"
hallo

"
say
my
aunt
,
after
a
long
time

I
look
up

meet
her
sharp
bright

respectfully

I

"
   
<EOS>
My
spirit
sink
under
these
word
,
and
I
become
very
downcast
and
heavy
of
heart
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
without
appear
to
take
much
heed
of
me
,
put
on
a
coarse
apron
with
a
bib
,
which
she
take
out
of
the
press
;
wash
up
the
teacup
with
her
own
hand
;
and
,
when
everything
be
wash
and
set
in
the
tray
again
,
and
the
cloth
fold
and
put
on
the
top
of
the
whole

ring
for
Janet
to
remove
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
next
sweep
up
the
crumb
with
a
little
broom
(
put
on
a
pair
of
glove
first
)
,
until
there
do
not

one
microscopic
speck
leave
on

next
dust
and
arrange
the

which
be
dust

arrange
to

<EOS>
when
all

satisfaction

she
take
off
the
glove

fold

bring

"

his
Memorial
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
rise
with
all
alacrity
,
to
acquit
myself
of
this
commission
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
"
say
my
aunt
,
eye
me
as
narrowly
as
she
have
eye
the
needle
in
thread
it
,
"
you
think
Mr
Dick
a
short
name
,
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
rather
a
short
name
,
yesterday
,
"
I
confess
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
to
suppose
that
he
have
not
get
a
long
name
,
if
he
choose
to
use
it
,
"
say
my
aunt
,
with
a
lofty
air
.
 
<EOS>
"
Babley
---
Mr
Richard
Babley
<EOS>
---
that
be
the
gentleman
's
true
name
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
suggest
,
with
a
modest
sense
of
my
youth
and
the
familiarity
I
have
be
already
guilty
of
<EOS>
,
that
I
have
better
give
him
the
full
benefit
of
that
name
,
when
my
aunt
go
on
to
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
but
do
not
you
call
him
by
it
,
whatever
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
can
not
bear
his
name
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
a
peculiarity
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
though
I
do
not
know
that
it
be
much
of
a
peculiarity
,
either
;
for
he
have
be
ill
-
use
enough
,
by
some
that
bear
it
,
to
have
a
mortal
antipathy
for
it
,
Heaven
know
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
be
his
name
here
,
and
everywhere
else
,
now
---
if
he
ever
go
anywhere
else
,
which
he
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
so
take
care
,
child
,
you
do
not
call
him
anything
<EOS>
BUT
Mr
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
promise
to
obey
,
and
go
upstairs
with
my
message
;
thinking
,
as
I
go
,
that
if
Mr
Dick
have
be
work
at
his
Memorial
long
,
at
the
same
rate
as
I
have
see
him
work
at
it
,
through
the
open
door
,
when
I
come
down
,
he
be
probably
get
on
very
well
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
him
still
drive
at
it
with
a
long
pen
,
and
his
head
almost
lay
upon
the
paper
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
so
intent
upon
it
,
that
I
have
ample
leisure
to
observe
the
large
paper
kite
in
a
corner
,
the
confusion
of
bundle
of
manuscript
,
the
number
of
pen
,
and
,
above
all
,
the
quantity
of
ink
(
which
he
seem
to
have
in
,
in
half
-
gallon
jar
by
the
dozen
)
,
before
he
observe
my
be
present
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
Phoebus
!
<EOS>
"
say
Mr
Dick
,
lay
down
his
pen
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
do
the
world
go
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
<EOS>
what
,
"
he
add
,
in
a
low
tone
,
"
I
should
not
wish
it
to
be
mention
,
but
it
be
a
---
"
<EOS>
here
he
beckon
to
me
,
and
put
his
lip
close
to
my
ear
---
<EOS>
"
it
be
a
mad
world
.
 
<EOS>
mad
as
Bedlam
,
boy
!
<EOS>
"
say
Mr
Dick
,
take
snuff
from
a
round
box
on
the
table
,
and
laugh
heartily
.
   
<EOS>
without
presume
to
give
my
opinion
on
this
question
,
I
deliver
my
message
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
"
say
Mr
Dick
,
in
answer
,
"
my
compliment
to
her
,
and
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
I
believe
I
have
make
a
start
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
make
a
start
,
"
say
Mr
Dick
,
pass
his
hand
among
his
grey
hair
,
and
cast
anything
but
a
confident
look
at
his
manuscript
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
be
to
school
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
"
I
answer
;
"
for
a
short
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
recollect
the
date
,
"
say
Mr
Dick
,
look
earnestly
at
me
,
and
take
up
his
pen
to
note
it
down
,
"
when
King
Charles
the
First
have
his
head
cut
off
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
say
I
believe
it
happen
in
the
year
sixteen
hundred
and
forty
-
nine
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
return
Mr
Dick
,
scratch
his
ear
with
his
pen
,
and
look
dubiously
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
so
the
book
say
;
but
I
do
not
see
how
that
can
be
.
 
<EOS>
because
,
if
it
be
so
long
ago
,
how
could
the
people
about
him
have
make
that
mistake
of
put
some
of
the
trouble
out
of
his
head
,
after
it
be
take
off
,
into
mine
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
surprised
by
the
inquiry
;
but
could
give
no
information
on
this
point
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
strange
,
"
say
Mr
Dick
,
with
a
despondent
look
upon
his
paper
,
and
with
his
hand
among
his
hair
again
,
"
that
I
never
can
get
that
quite
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
can
make
that
perfectly
clear
.
 
<EOS>
but
no
matter
,
no
matter
!
<EOS>
"
he
say
cheerfully
,
and
rouse
himself
,
"
there
be
time
enough
!
 
<EOS>
My
compliment
to
Miss
Trotwood
<EOS>
,
I
be
get
on
very
well
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
go
away
,
when
he
direct
my
attention
to
the
kite
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think
of
that
for
a
kite
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
   
<EOS>
I
answer
that
it
be
a
beautiful
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
think
it
must
have
be
as
much
as
seven
foot
high
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
make
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
go
and
fly
it
,
you
and
I
,
"
say
Mr
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
see
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
show
me
that
it
be
cover
with
manuscript
,
very
closely
and
laboriously
write
;
but
so
plainly
,
that
as
I
look
along
the
line
,
I
think
I
see
some
allusion
to
King
Charles
<EOS>
the
First
's
head
again
,
in
one
or
two
place
.
   
<EOS>
"
there
be
plenty
of
string
,
"
say
Mr
Dick
,
"
and
when
it
fly
high
,
it
take
the
fact
a
long
way
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
my
manner
of
diffuse
'em
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
where
they
may
come
down
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
accord
to
circumstance
,
and
the
wind
,
and
so
forth
;
but
I
take
my
chance
of
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
face
be
so
very
mild
and
pleasant
,
and
have
something
so
reverend
in
it
,
though
it
be
hale
and
hearty
,
that
I
be
not
sure
but
that
he
be
have
a
good
-
humoured
jest
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
laugh
,
and
he
laugh
,
and
we
part
the
good
friend
possible
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
child
,
"
say
my
aunt
,
when
I
go
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
what
of
Mr
Dick
,
this
morning
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
inform
her
that
he
send
his
compliment
,
and
be
get
on
very
well
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think
of
him
?
"
say
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
some
shadowy
idea
of
endeavour
to
evade
the
question
,
by
reply
that
I
think
him
a
very
nice
gentleman
;
but
my
aunt
be
not
to
be
so
put
off
,
for
she
lay
her
work
down
in
her
lap
,
and
say
,
fold
her
hand
upon
it
:
   
"
<EOS>
come
!
 
<EOS>
Your
sister
Betsey
Trotwood
would
have
tell
me
what
she
think
of
anyone
,
directly
.
 
<EOS>
be
as
like
your
sister
as
you
can
,
and
speak
out
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
be
he
---
be
Mr
Dick
<EOS>
---
I
ask
because
I
do
not
know
,
aunt
---
be
he
at
all
out
of
his
mind
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
stammer
;
for
I
feel
I
be
on
dangerous
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
not
a
morsel
,
"
say
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
I
observe
faintly
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
there
be
anything
in
the
world
,
"
say
my
aunt
,
with
great
decision
and
force
of
manner
,
"
that
Mr
Dick
be
not
,
it
be
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
well
to
offer
,
than
another
timid
,
"
<EOS>
oh
,
indeed
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
have
be
call
mad
,
"
say
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
selfish
pleasure
in
say
he
have
be
call
mad
,
or
I
should
not
have
have
the
benefit
of
his
society
and
advice
for
these
last
ten
year
and
upwards
---
in
fact
,
ever
since
your
sister
,
Betsey
Trotwood
,
disappoint
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
so
long
as
that
?
"
I
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
nice
people
they
be
,
who
have
the
audacity
to
call
him
mad
,
"
pursue
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dick
be
a
sort
of
distant
connexion
of
mine
---
it
do
not
matter
how
;
I
need
not
enter
into
that
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
have
not
be
for
me
,
his
own
brother
would
have
shut
him
up
for
life
.
<EOS>
that
be
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
it
be
hypocritical
in
me
,
but
see
that
my
aunt
feel
strongly
on
the
subject
,
I
try
to
look
as
if
I
feel
strongly
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
a
proud
fool
!
"
say
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
because
his
brother
be
a
little
eccentric
---
though
he
be
not
half
so
eccentric
as
a
good
many
people
---
he
do
not
like
to
have
him
visible
about
his
house
,
and
send
him
away
to
some
private
asylum
-
place
:
though
he
have
be
leave
to
his
particular
care
by
their
deceased
father
,
who
think
him
almost
a
natural
.
 
<EOS>
and
a
wise
man
he
must
have
be
to
think
so
!
<EOS>
mad
himself
,
no
doubt
.
"
   
<EOS>
again
,
as
my
aunt
look
quite
convinced
,
I
endeavour
to
look
quite
convinced
also
.
   
<EOS>
"
so
I
step
in
,
"
say
my
aunt
,
"
and
make
him
an
offer
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
Your
brother
's
sane
---
a
great
deal
more
sane
than
you
be
,
or
ever
will
be
,
it
be
to
be
hope
.
 
<EOS>
let
him
have
his
little
income
,
and
come
and
live
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
afraid
of
him
,
I
be
not
proud
,
I
be
ready
to
take
care
of
him
,
and
shall
not
ill
-
treat
him
as
some
people
(
besides
the
asylum
-
folk
)
have
do
.
"
 
<EOS>
after
a
good
deal
of
squabbling
,
"
say
my
aunt
,
"
I
get
him
;
and
he
have
be
here
ever
since
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
the
most
friendly
and
amenable
creature
in
existence
;
and
as
for
advice
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
but
nobody
know
what
that
man
's
mind
be
,
except
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
smooth
her
dress
and
shake
her
head
,
as
if
she
smooth
defiance
of
the
whole
world
out
of
the
one
,
and
shake
it
out
of
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
have
a
favourite
sister
,
"
say
my
aunt
,
"
a
good
creature
,
and
very
kind
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
do
what
they
all
do
---
take
a
husband
.
<EOS>
and
he
do
what
they
all
do
---
make
her
wretched
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
such
an
effect
upon
the
mind
of
Mr
Dick
(
that
be
not
madness
,
I
hope
!
)
<EOS>
that
,
combine
with
his
fear
of
his
brother
,
and
his
sense
of
his
unkindness
,
it
throw
him
into
a
fever
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
before
he
come
to
me
,
but
the
recollection
of
it
be
oppressive
to
him
even
now
.
 
<EOS>
do
he
say
anything
to
you
about
King
Charles
the
first
,
child
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
say
my
aunt
,
rub
her
nose
as
if
she
be
a
little
vexed
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
his
allegorical
way
of
express
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
connect
his
illness
with
great
disturbance
and
agitation
,
naturally
,
and
that
be
the
figure
,
or
the
simile
,
or
whatever
it
be
call
,
which
he
choose
to
use
.
 
<EOS>
and
why
should
not
he
,
if
he
think
proper
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
say
:
"
certainly
,
aunt
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
a
business
-
like
way
of
speak
,
"
say
my
aunt
,
"
nor
a
worldly
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
aware
of
that
;
and
that
be
the
reason
why
I
insist
upon
it
,
that
there
shall
not
be
a
word
about
it
in
his
Memorial
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
be
it
a
memorial
about
his
own
history
that
he
be
write
,
aunt
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
child
,
"
say
my
aunt
,
rub
her
nose
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
memorialize
the
Lord
Chancellor
,
or
the
Lord
Somebody
or
other

one
of
those
people
,
at
all
event
,
who
be
pay
to
be
memorialize
---
about
his
affair
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
will
go
in
,
one
of
these
day
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
able
to
draw
it
up
yet
,
without
introduce
that
mode
of
express
himself
;
but
it
do
not
signify
;
it
keep
him
employ
.
"
   
<EOS>
in
fact
,
I
find
out
afterwards
that
Mr
Dick
have
be
for
upward
of
ten
year
endeavour
to
keep
King
Charles
the
first
out
of
the
Memorial
;
but
he
have
be
constantly
get
into
it
,
and
be
there
now
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
again
,
"
say
my
aunt
,
"
nobody
know
what
that
man
's
mind
be
except
myself
;
and
he
be
the
most
amenable
and
friendly
creature
in
existence
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
like
to
fly
a
kite
sometimes
,
what
of
that
!
<EOS>
Franklin
use
to
fly
a
kite
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
Quaker
,
or
something
of
that
sort
,
if
I
be
not
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
and
a
Quaker
fly
a
kite
be
a
much
more
ridiculous
object
than
anybody
else
.
"
   
<EOS>
if
I
could
have
suppose
that
my
aunt
have
recount
these
particular
for
my
especial
behoof
,
and
as
a
piece
of
confidence
in
me
,
I
should
have
feel
very
much
distinguished
,
and
should
have
augur
favourably
from
such
a
mark
of
her
good
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
could
hardly
help
observe
that
she
have
launch
into
them
,
chiefly
because
the
question
be
raise
in
her
own
mind
,
and
with
very
little
reference
to
me
,
though
she
have
address
herself
to
me
in
the
absence
of
anybody
else
.
   
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
I
must
say
that
the
generosity
of
her
championship
of
poor
harmless
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
,
not
only
inspire
my
young
breast
with
some
selfish
hope
for
myself
,
but
warm
it
unselfishly
towards
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
that
I
begin
to
know
that
there
be
something
about
my
aunt
,
notwithstanding
her
many
eccentricity
and
odd
humour
,
to
be
honour
and
trust
in
.
 
<EOS>
though
she
be
just
as
sharp
that
day
as
on
the
day
before
,
and
be
in
and
out
about
the
donkey
just
as
often
,
and
be
throw
into
a
tremendous
state
of
indignation
,
when
a
young
man
,
go
by
,
ogle
Janet
at
a
window
(
which
be
one
of
the
grave
misdemeanour
that
could
be
commit
against
my
aunt
's
dignity
)
,
she
seem
to
me
to
command
more
of
my
respect
,
if
not
less
of
my
fear
.
   
<EOS>
the
anxiety
I
undergo
,
in
the
interval
which
necessarily
elapse
before
a
reply
could
be
receive
to
her
letter
to
Mr
Murdstone
,
be
extreme
;
but
I
make
an
endeavour
to
suppress
it
,
and
to
be
as
agreeable
as
I
could
in
a
quiet
way
,
both
to
my
aunt
and
Mr
Dick
.
<EOS>
the
latter
and
I
would
have
go
out
to
fly
the
great
kite
;
but
that
I
have
still
no
other
clothe
than
the
anything
but
ornamental
garment
with
which
I
have
be
decorate
on
the
first
day
,
and
which
confine
me
to
the
house
,
except
for
an
hour
after
dark
,
when
my
aunt
,
for
my
health
's
sake
,
parade
me
up
and
down
on
the
cliff
outside
,
before
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
the
reply
from
Mr
Murdstone
come
,
and
my
aunt
inform
me
,
to
my
infinite
terror
,
that
he
be
come
to
speak
to
her
herself
on
the
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
next
day
,
still
bundle
up
in
my
curious
habiliment
,
I
sit
count
the
time
,
flush
and
heat
by
the
conflict
of
sink
hope
and
rise
fear
within
me
;
and
wait
to
be
startle
by
the
sight
of
the
gloomy
face
,
whose
non
-
arrival
startle
me
every
minute
.
   
<EOS>
my
aunt
be
a
little
more
imperious
and
stern
than
usual
,
but
I
observe
no
other
token
of
her
prepare
herself
to
receive
the
visitor
so
much
dread
by
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
sit
at
work
in
the
window
,
and
I
sit
by
,
with
my
thought
run
astray
on
all
possible
and
impossible
result
of
Mr
Murdstone
's
visit
,
until
pretty
late
in
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
Our
dinner
have
be
indefinitely
postpone
;
but
it
be
grow
so
late
,
that
my
aunt
have
order
it
to
be
get
ready
,
when
she
give
a
sudden
alarm
of
donkey
,
and
to
my
consternation
and
amazement
,
I
beheld
Miss
Murdstone
,
on
a
side
-
saddle
,
ride
deliberately
over
the
sacred
piece
of
green
,
and
stop
in
front
of
the
house
,
look
about
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
go
along
with
you
!
"
<EOS>
cry
my
aunt
,
shake
her
head
and
her
fist
at
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
business
there
.
 
<EOS>
how
dare
you
trespass
?
 
<EOS>
go
along
!
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
you
bold
-
face
thing
!
"
   
<EOS>
my
aunt
be
so
exasperate
by
the
coolness
with
which
Miss
Murdstone
look
about
her
,
that
I
really
believe
she
be
motionless
,
and
unable
for
the
moment
to
dart
out
accord
to
custom
.
 
<EOS>
I
seize
the
opportunity
to
inform
her
who
it
be
;
and
that
the
gentleman
now
come
near
the
offender
(
for
the
way
up
be
very
steep
,
and
he
have
drop
behind
)
,
be
Mr
Murdstone
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
who
it
be
!
"
cry
my
aunt
,
still
shake
her
head
and
gesticulate
anything
<EOS>
but
welcome
from
the
bow
-
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
be
trespass
upon

<EOS>
I
will
not
allow
it
.
 
<EOS>
go
away
!
 
<EOS>
Janet
,
turn
him
round
.
 
<EOS>
lead
him
off
!
"
<EOS>
and
I
see
,
from
behind
my
aunt
,
a
sort
of
hurried
battle
-
piece
,
in
which
the
donkey
stand
resist
everybody
,
with
all
his
four
leg
plant
different
way
,
while
Janet
try
to
pull
him
round
by
the
bridle
,
Mr
Murdstone
try
to
lead
him
on
,
Miss
Murdstone
strike
at
Janet
with
a
parasol
,
and
several
boy
,
who
have
come
to
see
the
engagement
,
shout
vigorously
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
aunt
,
suddenly
descry
among
them
the
young
malefactor
who
be
the
donkey
's
guardian
,
and
who
be
one
of
the
most
inveterate
offender
against
her
,
though
hardly
in
his
teen
,
rush
out
to
the
scene
of
action
,
pounce
upon
him
,
capture
him
,
drag
him
,
with
his
jacket
over
his
head
,
and
<EOS>
his
heel
grind
the
ground
,
into
the
garden
,
and
,
call
upon
Janet
to
fetch
the
constable
and
justice
,
that
he
may
be
take
,
try
,
and
execute
on
the
spot
,
hold
him
at
bay
there
.
 
<EOS>
this
part
of
the
business
,
however
,
do
not
last
long
;
for
the
young
rascal
,
be
expert
at
a
variety
of
feint
and
dodge
,
of
which
my
aunt
have
no
conception
,
soon
go
whoop
away
,
leave
some
deep
impression
of
his
nail
boot
in
the
flower
-
bed
,
and
take
his
donkey
in
triumph
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
,
during
the
latter
portion
of
the
contest
,
have
dismount
,
and
be
now
wait
with
her
brother
at
the
bottom
of
the
step
,
until
my
aunt
should
be
at
leisure
to
receive
them
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
a
little
ruffle
by
the
combat
,
march
past
them
into
the
house
,
with
great
dignity
,
and
take
no
notice
of
their
presence

until
they
be
announce
by
Janet

"
Shall

<EOS>
with

she
push
me
into

corner
near
her

and
fence
Me
in
with
a
chair
,
as
if
it
be
a
prison

a
bar
of
justice

<EOS>
this
position
I
continue
to
occupy
during
the
whole
interview

from
it
I
now
see
Mr

It
be
clear
enough

as
I
have
tell

year

why
,
in
the
mysterious
dispensation
of
Providence

you
ever
do
see
her

be
more
than
humanity
can
comprehend
---
it
be
clear
enough
that
the
poor
soft
little
thing
would
marry
somebody
,
at
some
time

other

I
do
hope
it
would
not

be
as
bad

turn
out

stand

all
this

observant

black

heavily

I
remark
now

that

still

his

have
go

without

haughtily
out

now

I
never

of
anything
about
myself

distinctly

<EOS>
the
two
thing
clear
in
my
mind
be
,
that
a
remoteness
have
come
upon
the
old
Blunderstone
life

which
seem
to
lie
in
the
haze

an
immeasurable
distance

that
a
curtain
have
for
ever
fall
on
my
life

Murdstone

Grinby

.
 
<EOS>
no
one
have
ever
raise
that
curtain
since

<EOS>
I
have
lift
it
for
a
moment
,
even
in
this
narrative
,
with
a
reluctant
hand
,
and
drop
it
gladly
.
 
<EOS>
the
remembrance
of
that
life
be
fraught
with
so
much
pain
to
me
,
with
so
much
mental
suffering
and
want
of
hope
,
that
I
have
never
have
the
courage
even
to
examine
how
long
I
be
doom
to
lead
it
.
 
<EOS>
whether
it
last
for
a
year
,
or
more
,
or
less
,
I
do
not
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
know
that
it
be

and
cease
to
be

and
that
I
have
write
,
and
there
I
leave

Chapter
15
.
<EOS>
I
make
another
beginning
 
Mr
Dick
<EOS>
and
I
soon
become
the
good
of
friend
,
and
very
often
,
when
his
day
's
work
be
do
,
go
out
together
to
fly
the
great
kite
.
 
<EOS>
every
day
of
his
life
he
have
a
long
sit
at
the
Memorial
,
which
never
make
the
least
progress
,
however
hard
he
labour
,
for
King
Charles
the
First
always
stray
into
it
,
sooner
or
later
,
and
then
it
be
throw
aside
,
and
another
one
begin
.
 
<EOS>
the
patience
and
hope
with
which
he
bear
these
perpetual
disappointment
,
the
mild
perception
he
have
that
there
be
something
wrong
about
King
Charles
<EOS>
the
first
,
the
feeble
effort
he
make
to
keep
him
out
,
and
the
certainty
with
which
he
come
in
,
and
tumble
the
Memorial
out
of
all
shape
,
make
a
deep
impression
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
what
Mr
Dick
suppose
would
come
of
the
Memorial
<EOS>
,
if
it
be
complete
;
where
he
think
it
be
to
go
,
or
what
he
think
it
be
to
do
;
he
know
no
more
than
anybody
else
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
it
at
all
necessary
that
he
should
trouble
himself
with
such
question
,
<EOS>
for
if
anything
be
certain
under
the
sun
,
it
be
certain
that
the
Memorial
never
would
be
finish
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
quite
an
affect
sight
<EOS>
,
I
use
to
think
,
to
see
him
with
the
kite
when
it
be
up
a
great
height
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
what
he
have
tell
me
,
in
his
room
,
about
his
belief
in
its
disseminate
the
statement
paste
on
it
,
which
be
nothing
but
old
leave
of
abortive
Memorials
,
may
have
be
a
fancy
with
him
sometimes
;
but
not
when
he
be
out
,
look
up
at
the
kite
in
the
sky
,
and
feel
it
pull
and
tug
at
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
look
so
serene
as
he
do
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
use
to
fancy
,
as
I
sit
by
him
of
an
evening
,
on
a
green
slope
,
and
see
him
watch
the
kite
high
in
the
quiet
air
,
that
it
lift
his
mind
out
of
its
confusion
,
and
bear
it
<EOS>
(
such
be
my
boyish
thought
)
into
the
sky
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
wind
the
string
in
and
it
come
lower
and
lower
down
out
of
the
beautiful
light
,
until
it
flutter
to
the
ground
,
and
lie
there
like
a
dead
thing
,
he
seem
to
wake
gradually
out
of
a
dream
;
and
I
remember
to
have
see
him
take
it
up
,
and
look
about
him
in
a
lost
way
,
as
if
they
have
both
come
down
together
,
so
that
I
pity
him
with
all
my
heart
.
   
<EOS>
while
I
advance
in
friendship
and
intimacy
with
Mr
Dick
,
I
do
not
go
backward
in
the
favour
of
his
staunch
friend
,
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
She
take
so
kindly
to
me
,
that
,
in
the
course
of
a
few
week
,
she
shorten
my
adopted
name
of
Trotwood
into
Trot
;
and
even
encourage
me
to
hope
,
that
if
I
go
on
as
I
have
begin
,
I
may
take
equal
rank
in
her
affection
with
my
sister
Betsey
Trotwood
.
   
<EOS>
"
Trot
,
"
say
my
aunt
one
evening
,
when
the
backgammon
-
board
be
place
as
usual
for
herself
and
Mr
Dick
,
"
we
must
not
forget
your
education
.
"
   
<EOS>
this
be
my
only
subject
of
anxiety
,
and
I
feel
quite
delighted
by
her
refer
to
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Should
you
like
to
go
to
school
at
Canterbury
?
"
say
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
I
reply
that
I
should
like
it
very
much
,
as
it
be
so
near
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
good
,
"
say
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Should
you
like
to
go
tomorrow
?
"
   
<EOS>
be
already
no
stranger
to
the
general
rapidity
of
my
aunt
's
evolution
,
I
be
not
surprise
by
the
suddenness
of
the
proposal
,
and
say
:
"
<EOS>
yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
good
,
"
say
my
aunt
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Janet
,
hire
the
grey
pony
and
chaise
tomorrow
morning
at
ten
o'clock
,
and
pack
up
Master
Trotwood
's
clothe
tonight
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
greatly
elated
by
these
order
;
but
my
heart
smite
me
for
my
selfishness
,
when
I
witness
their
effect
on
Mr
Dick
,
who
be
so
low
-
spirited
at
the
prospect
of
our
separation
,
and
play
so
ill
in
consequence
,
that
my
aunt
,
after
give
him
several
admonitory
rap
on
the
knuckle
with
her
dice
-
box
,
shut
up
the
board
,
and
decline
to
play
with
him
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
on
hearing
from
my
aunt
that
I
should
sometimes
come
over
on
a
Saturday
,
and
that
he
could
sometimes
come
and
see
me
on
a
Wednesday
<EOS>
,
he
revive
;
and
vow
to
make
another
kite
for
those
occasion
,
of
proportion
greatly
surpass
the
present
one
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
morning
he
be
downhearte
again
,
and
would
have
sustain
himself
by
give
me
all
the
money
he
have
in
his
possession
,
gold
and
silver
too
,
if
my
aunt
have
not
interpose
,
and
limit
the
gift
to
five
shilling
,
which
,
at
his
earnest
petition
,
be
afterwards
increase
to
ten
.
 
<EOS>
We
part
at
the
garden
-
gate
in
a
most
affectionate
manner
,
and
Mr
Dick
do
not
go
into
the
house
until
my
aunt
have
drive
me
out
of
sight
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
who
be
perfectly
indifferent
to
public
opinion
,
drive
the
grey
pony
through
Dover
in
a
masterly
manner
;
sit
high
and
stiff
like
a
state
coachman
,
keep
a
steady
eye
upon
him
wherever
he
go
,
and
make
a
point
of
not
let
him
have
his
own
way
in
any
respect
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
come
into
the
country
road
,
she
permit
him
to
relax
a
little
,
however
;
and
look
at
me
down
in
a
valley
of
cushion
by
her
side
,
ask
me
whether
I
be
happy
?
   
<EOS>
"
very
happy
indeed
,
thank
you
,
aunt
,
"
I
say
.
   
<EOS>
She
be
much
gratified
;
and
both
her
hand
be
occupy
,
pat
me
on
the
head
with
her
whip
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
it
a
large
school
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
do
not
know
,
"
say
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
be
go
to
Mr
Wickfield
's
first
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
he
keep
a
school
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
Trot
,
"
say
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
keep
an
office
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
ask
for
no
more
information
about
Mr
Wickfield
,
as
she
offer
none
,
and
we
converse
on
other
subject
until
we
come
to
Canterbury
,
where
,
as
it
be
market
-
day
,
my
aunt
have
a
great
opportunity
of
insinuate
the
grey
pony
among
cart
,
basket
,
vegetable
,
and
huckster
's
good
.
 
<EOS>
the
hair
-
breadth
turn
and
twist
we
make
,
draw
down
upon
us
a
variety
of
speech
from
the
people
stand
about
,
which
be
not
always
complimentary
;
but
my
aunt
drive
on
with
perfect
indifference
,
and
I
dare
say
would
have
take
her
own
way
with
as
much
coolness
through
an
enemy
's
country
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
we
stop
before
a
very
old
house
bulge
out
over
the
road
;
a
house
with
long
low
lattice
-
window
bulge
out
still
farther
,
and
beam
with
carved
head
on
the
end
bulge
out
too
,
so
that
I
fancy
the
whole
house
be
lean
forward
,
try
to
see
who
be
pass
on
the
narrow
pavement
below
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
quite
spotless
in
its
cleanliness
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
-
fashioned
brass
knocker
on
the
low
arched
door
,
ornament
with
carved
garland
of
fruit
and
flower
,
twinkle
like
a
star
;
the
two
stone
step
descend
to
the
door
be
as
white
as
if
they
have
be
cover
with
fair
linen
;
and
all
the
angle
and
corner
,
and
carving
and
moulding
,
and
quaint
little
pane
of
glass
,
and
quainter
little
window
,
<EOS>
though
as
old
as
the
hill
,
be
as
pure
as
any
snow
that
ever
fall
upon
the
hill
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
pony
-
chaise
stop
at
the
door
,
and
my
eye
be
intent
upon
the
house
,
I
see
a
cadaverous
face
appear
at
a
small
window
on
the
ground
floor
(
in
a
little
round
tower
that
form
one
side
of
the
house
)
,
and
quickly
disappear
.
 
<EOS>
the
low
arched
door
then
open
,
and
the
face
come
out
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
quite
as
cadaverous
as
it
have
look
in
the
window
,
though
in
the
grain
of
it
there
be
that
tinge
of
red
which
be
sometimes
to
be
observe
in
the
skin
of
red
-
haired
people
.
 
<EOS>
It
belong
to
a
red
-
haired
person
---
a
youth
of
fifteen
,
as
I
take
it
now
,
but
look
much
old
---
whose
hair
be
crop
as
close
as
the
close
stubble
;
who
have
hardly
any
eyebrow
,
and
no
eyelash
,
and
eye
of
a
red
-
brown
,
so
unsheltered
and
unshaded
,
that
I
remember
wonder
how
he
go
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
high
-
shouldered
and
bony
;
dress
in
decent
black
,
with
a
white
wisp
of
a
neckcloth
;
button
up
to
the
throat
;
and
have
a
long
,
lank
,
skeleton
hand
,
which
particularly
attract
my
attention
,
as
he
stand
at
the
pony
's
head
,
rub
his
chin
with
it
,
and
look
up
at
us
in
the
chaise
.
   
<EOS>
"

Mr
Wickfield

,
Uriah
Heep

my

"
<EOS>
Mr

"
if
you
will
please

there
"
---
point
with
his
long
hand
to
the
room
he
mean
.
   
<EOS>
We
get
out
;
and
leave
him
to
hold
the
pony
,
go
into
a
long
low
parlour
look
towards
the
street
,
from
the
window
of
which
I
catch
a
glimpse
,
as
I
go
in
,
of
Uriah
Heep
breathe
into
the
pony
's
nostril
,
and
immediately
cover
them
with
his
hand
,
as
if
he
be
put
some
spell
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
opposite
to
the
tall
old
chimney
-
piece
be
two
portrait
:
one
of
a
gentleman
with
grey
hair
(
though
not
by
any
mean
an
old
man
)
and
black
eyebrow
,
who
be
look
over
some
paper
tie
together
with
red
tape
;
the
other
,
of
a
lady
,
with
a
very
placid
and
sweet
expression
of
face
,
who
be
look
at
me
.
   
<EOS>
I
believe
I
be
turn
about
in
search
of
Uriah
's
picture
,
when
,
a
door
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
opening
,
a
gentleman
enter
,
at
sight
of
whom
I
turn
to
the
first
-
mention
portrait
again
,
to
make
quite
sure
that
it
have
not
come
out
of
its
frame
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
stationary
;
and
as
the
gentleman
advance
into
the
light
,
I
see
that
he
be
some
year
old
than
when
he
have
have
his
picture
paint
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Betsey
Trotwood

the
gentleman
,
"
pray

<EOS>
I

but
you
will
excuse
my

<EOS>
You

I

<EOS>
but
one

"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Betsey
thank
him
,
and
we
go
into
his
room
,
which
be
furnish
as
an
office
,
with
book
,
paper
,
tin
box
,
and
so
forth
.
 
<EOS>
It
look
into
a
garden
,
and
have
an
iron
safe
let
into
the
wall
;
so
immediately
over
the
mantelshelf
,
that
I
wonder
,
as
I
sit
down
,
how
the
sweep
get
round
it
when
they
sweep
the
chimney
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
Miss
Trotwood
,
"
say
Mr
Wickfield
;
for
I
soon
find
that
it
be
he
,
and
that
he
be
a
lawyer
,
and
steward
of
the
estate
of
a
rich
gentleman
of
the
county
;
"
what
wind
blow
you
here
?
 
<EOS>
not
an
ill
wind

I
hope
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
no

my

<EOS>
"
I

not

<EOS>
"
that

"
say
Mr
Wickfield
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
come
for
anything
else
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
hair
be
quite
white
now
,
though
his
eyebrow
be
still
black
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
very
agreeable
face
,
and
,
I
think
,
be
handsome
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
certain
richness
in
his
complexion
,
which
I
have
be
long
accustom
,
under
Peggotty
's
tuition
,
to
connect
with
port
wine
;
and
I
fancy
it
be
in
his
voice
too
,
and
refer
his
grow
corpulency
to
the
same
cause
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
cleanly
dress
,
in
a
blue
coat
,
stripe
waistcoat
,
and
nankeen
trouser
;
and
his
fine
frilled
shirt
and
cambric
neckcloth
look
unusually
soft
and
white
,
remind
my
stroll
fancy
<EOS>
(
I
call
to
mind
)
of
the
plumage
on
the
breast
of
a
swan
.

where
he
may
be
thoroughly
well
teach
,
and
well
treat
.
 
<EOS>
now
tell
me
where
that
school
be
,
and
what
it
be
,
and
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
before
I
can
advise
you
properly
,
"
say
Mr
Wickfield
---
"
the
old
question
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
your
motive
in
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Deuce
take
the
man
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
always
fish
for
motive
,
when
they
be
on
the
surface
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
to
make
the
child
happy
and
useful
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
a
mixed
motive
,
I
think
,
"
say
Mr
Wickfield
,
shake
his
head
and
smile
incredulously
.
   
<EOS>
"
a
mixed
fiddlestick
,
"
return
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
claim
to
have
one
plain
motive
in
all
you
do
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
not
suppose
,
I
hope
,
that
you
be
the
only
plain
dealer
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
ay
,
but
I
have
only
one
motive
in
life
,
Miss
Trotwood
,
"
he
rejoin
,
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
other
people
have
dozen
,
score
,
hundred
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
one
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
difference
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
that
be
beside
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
the
good
school
?
 
<EOS>
whatever
the
motive
,
you
want
the
good
?
"
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
nodded
assent
.
   
<EOS>
"
at
the
good
we
have
,
"
say
Mr
Wickfield
,
<EOS>
consider
,
"
your
nephew
could
not
board
just
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
but
he
could
board
somewhere
else
,
I
suppose
?
"
suggest
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Wickfield
think
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
little
discussion
,
he
propose
to
take
my
aunt
to
the
school
,
that
she
may
see
it
and
judge
for
herself
;
also
,
to
take
her
,
with
the
same
object
,
to
two
or
three
house
where
he
think
I
could
be
board
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
embrace
the
proposal
,
we
be
all
three
go
out
together
,
when
he
stop
and
say
:
   
<EOS>
"
Our
little
friend
here
may
have
some
motive
,
perhaps
,
for
object
to
the
arrangement
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
we
have
better
leave
him
behind
?
"
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
seem
disposed
to
contest
the
point
;
but
to
facilitate
matter
<EOS>
I
say
I
would
gladly
remain
behind
,
if
they
please
;
and
return
into
Mr
Wickfield
's
office
,
where
I
sit
down
again
,
in
the
chair
I
have
first
occupy
,
to
await
their
return
.
   
<EOS>
It
so
happen
that
this
chair
be
opposite
a
narrow
passage
,
which
end
in
the
little
circular
room
where
I
have
see
Uriah
Heep
's
pale
face
look
out
of
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
Uriah
,
have
take
the
pony
to
a
neighbouring
stable
,
be
at
work
at
a
desk
in
this
room
,
which
have
a
brass
frame
on
the
top
to
hang
paper
upon
,
and
on
which
the
writing
he
be
make
a
copy
of
be
then
hang
.
 
<EOS>
though
his
face
be
towards
me
,
I
think
,
for
some
time
,
the
writing
be
between
us
,
that
he
could
not
see
me
;
but
look
that
way
more
attentively
,
it
make
me
uncomfortable
to
observe
that
,
every
now
and
then
,
his
sleepless
eye
would
come
below
the
writing
,
like
two
red
sun
,
and
stealthily
stare
at
me
for
I
dare
say
a
whole
minute
at
a
time
,
during
which
his
pen
go
,
or
pretend
to
go
,
as
cleverly
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
several
attempt
to
get
out
of
their
way
---
such
as
stand
on
a
chair
to
look
at
a
map
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
,
and
pore
over
the
column
of
a
kentish
newspaper
---
but
they
always
attract
me
back
again
;
and
whenever
I
look
towards
those
two
red
sun
,
I
be
sure
to
find
them
,
either
just
rise
or
just
set
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
,
much
to
my
relief
,
my
aunt
and
Mr
Wickfield
come
back
,
after
a
pretty
long
absence
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
not
so
successful
as
I
could
have
wish
;
for
though
the
advantage
of
the
school
be
undeniable
,
my
aunt
have
not
approve
of
any
of
the
boarding
-
house
propose
for
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
unfortunate
,
"
say
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
to
do
,
Trot
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
do
happen
unfortunately
,
"
say
Mr
Wickfield
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
will
tell
you
what
you
can
do
,
Miss
Trotwood
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
?
<EOS>
"
inquire
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
leave
your
nephew
here
,
for
the
present
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
quiet
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
not
disturb
me
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
capital
house
for
study
.
 
<EOS>
as
quiet
as
a
monastery
,
and
almost
as
roomy
.
 
<EOS>
leave
him
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
evidently
like
the
offer
,
though
she
be
delicate
of
accept
it
.
 
<EOS>
so
do
I.
"
come
,
Miss
Trotwood
,
"
say
Mr
Wickfield
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
the
way
out
of
the
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
a
temporary
arrangement
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
do
not
act
well
,
or
do
not
quite
accord
with
our
mutual
convenience
,
he
can
easily
go
to
the
right
-
about
.
 
<EOS>
there
will
be
time
to
find
some
well
place
for
him
in
the
meanwhile
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
well
determine
to
leave
him
here
for
the
present
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
much
oblige
to
you
,
"
say
my
aunt
;
"
<EOS>
and
so
be
he
,
I
see
;
<EOS>
but
---
"
   
"
come
!
<EOS>
I
know
what
you
mean
,
"
cry
Mr
Wickfield
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
be
oppress
by
the
receipt
of
favour
,
Miss
Trotwood
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
pay
for
him
,
if
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
not
be
hard
about
term
,
but
you
shall
pay
if
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
on
that
understanding
,
"
say
my
aunt
,
"
though
it
do
not
lessen
the
real
obligation
,
I
shall
be
very
glad
to
leave
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
then
come
and
see
my
little
housekeeper
,
"
say
Mr
Wickfield
.
   
<EOS>
We
accordingly
go
up
a
wonderful
old
staircase
;
with
a
balustrade
so
broad
that
we
may
have
go
up
that
,
almost
as
easily
;
and
into
a
shady
old
drawing
-
room
,
light
by
some
three
or
four
of
the
quaint
window
I
have
look
up
at
from
the
street
:
which
have
old
oak
seat
in
them
,
that
seem
to
have
come
of
the
same
tree
as
the
shine
oak
floor
,
and
the
great
beam
in
the
ceiling
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
prettily
furnished
room
,
with
a
piano
and
some
lively
furniture
in
red
and
green
,
and
some
flower
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
be
all
old
nook
and
corner
;
and
in
every
nook
and
corner
there
be
some
queer
little
table
,
or
cupboard
,
or
bookcase
,
or
seat
,
or
something
or
other
,
that
make
me
think
there
be
not
such
another
good
corner
in
the
room
;
until
I
look
at
the
next
one
,
and
find
it
equal
to
it
,
if
not
well
.
 
<EOS>
on
everything
there
be
the
same
air
of
retirement
and
cleanliness
that
mark
the
house
outside
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Wickfield
tap
at
a
door
in
a
corner
of
the
panel
wall
,
and
a
girl
of
about
my
own
age
come
quickly
out
and
kiss
him
.
 
<EOS>
on
her
face
,
I
see
immediately
the
placid
and
sweet
expression
of
the
lady
whose
picture
have
look
at
me
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
my
imagination
as
if
the
portrait
have
grow
womanly
,
and
the
original
remain
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
although
her
face
be
quite
bright
and
happy
,
there
be
a
tranquillity
about
it
,
and
about
her
---
a
quiet
,
good
,
calm
spirit
---
that
I
never
have
forget
;
that
I
shall
never
forget
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
his
little
housekeeper
,
his
daughter
Agnes
,
Mr
Wickfield
say
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
hear
how
he
say
it
,
and
see
how
he
hold
her
hand
,
I
guess
what
the
one
motive
of
his
life
be
.
   
<EOS>
She
have
a
little
basket
-
trifle
hang
at
her
side
,
with
key
in
it
;
and
she
look
as
staid
and
as
discreet
a
housekeeper
as
the
old
house
could
have
.
 
<EOS>
She
listen
to
her
father
as
he
tell
her
about
me
,
with
a
pleasant
face
;
and
when
he
have
conclude
,
propose
to
my
aunt
that
we
should
go
upstairs
and
see
my
room
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
go
together
,
she
before
us
:
and
a
glorious
old
room
it
be
,
with
more
oak
beam
,
and
diamond
pane
;
and
the
broad
balustrade
go
all
the
way
up
to
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
can
not
call
to
mind
where
or
when
,
in
my
childhood
,
I
have
see
a
stain
glass
window
in
a
church
.
 
<EOS>
nor
do
I
recollect
its
subject
.
<EOS>
but
I
know
that
when
I
see
her
turn
round
,
in
the
grave
light
of
the
old
staircase
,
and
wait
for
us
,
above
,
I
think
of
that
window
;
and
I
associate
something
of
its
tranquil
brightness
with
Agnes
Wickfield
ever
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
be
as
happy
as
I
be
,
in
the
arrangement
make
for
me
;
and
we
go
down
to
the
drawing
-
room
again
,
well
pleased
and
gratified
.
<EOS>
as
she
would
not
hear
of
stay
to
dinner
,
lest
she
should
by
any
chance
fail
to
arrive
at
home
with
the
grey
pony
before
dark
;
and
as
I
apprehend
Mr
Wickfield
know
her
too
well
to
argue
any
point
with
her
;
some
lunch
be
provide
for
her
there
,
and
Agnes
go
back
to
her
governess
,
and
Mr
Wickfield
to
his
office
.
 
<EOS>
so
we
be
leave
to
take
leave
of
one
another
without
any
restraint
.
   
<EOS>
She
tell
me
that
everything
would
be
arrange
for
me
by
Mr
Wickfield
,
and
that
I
should
want
for
nothing
,
and
give
me
the
kind
word
and
the
good
advice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Trot
,
"
say
my
aunt
in
conclusion
,
"
be
a
credit
to
yourself
,
to
me
,
and
Mr
Dick
,
and
Heaven
be
with
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
greatly
overcome
,
and
could
only
thank
her
,
again
and
again
,
and
send
my
love
to
Mr
Dick
.
   
<EOS>
"
never
,
"
say
my
aunt
,
"
be
mean
in
anything
;
never
be
false
;
never
be
cruel
.
 
<EOS>
avoid
those
three
vice
,
Trot
,
and
I
can
always
be
hopeful
of
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
promise
,
as
well
as
<EOS>
I
could
,
that
I
would
not
abuse
her
kindness
or
forget
her
admonition
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
pony
be
at
the
door
,
"
say
my
aunt
,
"
and
I
be
off
!
<EOS>
stay
here
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
with
these
word
she
embrace
me
hastily
,
and
go
out
of
the
room
,
shut
the
door
after
her
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
I
be
startle
by
so
abrupt
a
departure
,
and
almost
fear
I
have
displease
her
;
but
when
I
look
into
the
street
,
and
see
how
dejectedly
she
get
into
the
chaise
,
and
drive
away
without
look
up
,
I
understand
her
better
and
do
not
do
her
that
injustice
.
   
<EOS>
by
five
o'clock
,
which
be
Mr
Wickfield
's
dinner
-
hour
,
I
have
muster
up
my
spirit
again
,
and
be
ready
for
my
knife
and
fork
.
<EOS>
the
cloth
be
only
lay
for
us
two
;
but
Agnes
be
wait
in
the
drawing
-
room
before
dinner
,
go
down
with
her
father
,
and
sit
opposite
to
him
at
table
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
he
could
have
dine
without
her
.
   
<EOS>
We
do
not
stay
there
,
after
dinner
,
but
come
upstairs
into
the
drawing
-
room
again
:
in
one
snug
corner
of
which
,
agne
set
glass
for
her
father
,
and
a
decanter
of
port
wine
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
he
would
have
miss
its
usual
flavour
,
if
it
have
be
put
there
for
him
by
any
other
hand
.
   
<EOS>
there
he
sit
,
take
his
wine
,
and
take
a
good
deal
of
it
,
for
two
hour
;
while
Agnes
play
on
the
piano
,
work
,
and
talk
to
him
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
,
for
the
most
part
,
gay
and
cheerful
with
us
;
but
sometimes
his
eye
rest
on
her
,
and
he
fall
into
a
brood
state
,
and
be
silent
.
 
<EOS>
She
always
observe
this
quickly
,
I
think
,
and
always
rouse
him
with
a
question
or
caress
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
come
out
of
his
meditation
,
and
drank
more
wine
.
   
<EOS>
agne
make
the
tea
,
and
preside
over
it
;
and
the
time
pass
away
after
it
,
as
after
dinner
,
until
she
go
to
bed
;
when
her
father
take
her
in
his
arm
and
kiss
her
,
and
,
she
be
go
,
order
candle
in
his
office
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
go
to
bed
too
.
   
<EOS>
but
in
the
course
of
the
evening
I
have
ramble
down
to
the
door
,
and
a
little
way
along
the
street
,
that
I
may
have
another
peep
at
the
old
house
,
and
the
grey
Cathedral
;
and
may
think
of
my
come
through
that
old
city
on
my
journey
,
and
of
my
pass
the
very
house
I
live
in
,
without
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
come
back
,
I
see
Uriah
Heep
shut
up
the
office
;
and
feel
friendly
towards
everybody
,
go
in
and
speak
to
him
,
and
at
parting
,
give
him
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
but
oh
,
what
a
clammy
hand
<EOS>
his
be
!
<EOS>
as
ghostly
to
the
touch
as
to
the
sight
!
 
<EOS>
I
rub
mine
afterwards
,
to
warm
it
,
and
to
rub
his
off
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
such
an
uncomfortable
hand
,
that
,
when
I
go
to
my
room

cold
and
wet
upon
my
memory

<EOS>
lean
out
of
the
window
,
and
see
one
of
the
face
on
the
beam

end
look
at
me
sideways

I
fancy

Uriah

Chapter
16

<EOS>
I
be
a
new
boy
in
more
sense
than
one
 
next
morning
,
after
breakfast
,
I
enter
on
school
life
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
,
accompany
by
Mr
Wickfield
,
to
the
scene
of
my
future
study
---
a
grave
building
in
a
courtyard
,
with
a
learned
air
about
it
that
seem
very
well
suited
to
the
stray
rook
and
jackdaw
who
come
down
from
the
cathedral
tower
to
walk
with
a
clerkly
bear
on
the
grass
-
plot
---
and
be
introduce
to
my
new
master
,
Doctor
Strong
.
   
<EOS>
Doctor
Strong
look
almost
as
rusty
,
to
my
thinking
,
as
the
tall
iron
rail
and
gate
outside
the
house
;
and
almost
as
stiff
and
heavy
as
the
great
stone
urn
that
flank
them
,
and
be
set
up
,
on
the
top
of
the
red
-
brick
wall
,
at
regular
distance
<EOS>
all
round
the
court
,
like
sublimate
skittle
,
for
Time
to
play
at
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
in
his
library
(
I
mean
Doctor
Strong
be
)
,
with
his
clothe
not
particularly
well
brush
,
and
his
hair
not
particularly
well
combed
;
his
knee
-
small
unbraced
;
his
long
black
gaiter
unbutton
;
and
his
shoe
yawn
like
two
cavern
on
the
hearth
-
rug
.
 
<EOS>
turn
upon
me
a
lustreless
eye
,
that
remind
me
of
a
long
-
forget
blind
old
horse
who
once
use
to
crop
the
grass
,
and
tumble
over
the
grave
,
in
Blunderstone
churchyard
,
he
say
he
be
glad
to
see
me
:
<EOS>
and
then
he
give
me
his
hand
;
which
I
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
,
as
it
do
nothing
for
itself
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
sit
at
work
,
not
far
from
Doctor
Strong
,
be
a
very
pretty
young
lady
---
whom
he
call
Annie
,
and
who
be
his
daughter
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
---
<EOS>
who
get
me
out
of
my
difficulty
by
kneel
down
to
put
Doctor
Strong
's
shoe
on
,
and
button
his
gaiter
,
which
she
do
with
great
cheerfulness
and
quickness
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
have
finish
,
and
we
be
go
out
to
the
schoolroom
,
I
be
much
surprised
to
hear
Mr
Wickfield
,
in
bid
her
good
morning
,
address
her
as
"
Mrs
Strong
"
;
and
I
be
wonder
could
she
be
Doctor
Strong
's
son
's
wife
,
or
could
she
be
Mrs
Doctor
Strong
,
when
Doctor
Strong
himself
unconsciously
enlighten
me
.

"
   
<EOS>
Doctor

regard
him
with
a
puzzled

doubting
look

which
almost
immediately
subside
into
a
smile
that
give

great
encouragement

for
it

full
of
amiability

sweetness

there
be
a

manner

when

studious

ponder
frost
upon

very
attractive

hopeful
to

<EOS>
repeat
"
no

,
and
"
not
the

"
,
and
other
short
assurance
to
the
same
purport
,
Doctor
Strong
jog
on
before
us
,
at
a
queer
,
uneven
pace
;
and
we
follow
:
<EOS>
Mr
Wickfield
,
look
grave
,
I
observe
,
and
shake
his
head
to
himself
,
without
know
that
I
see
him
.
   
<EOS>
the
schoolroom
be
a
pretty
large
hall
,
on
the
quiet
side
of
the
house
,
confront
by
the
stately
stare
of
some
half
-
dozen
of
the
great
urn
,
and
command
a
peep
of
an
old
secluded
garden
belong
to
the
Doctor
,
where
the
peach
be
ripen
on
the
sunny
south
wall
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
two
great
aloe
,
in
tub
,
on
the
turf
outside
the
window
;
the
broad
hard
leave
of
which
plant
(
look
as
if
they
be
make
of
paint
tin
)
<EOS>
have
ever
since
,
by
association
,
be
symbolical
to
me
of
silence
and
retirement
.
<EOS>
about
five
-
and
-
twenty
boy
be
studiously
engage
at
their
book
when
we
go
in
,
but
they
rise
to
give
the
Doctor
good
morning
,
and
remain
stand
when
they
see
Mr
Wickfield
and
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
new
boy
,
young
gentleman
,
"
say
the
Doctor
;
"
Trotwood
Copperfield
.
"
   
<EOS>
one
Adams
,
who
be
the
head
-
boy
,
then
step
out
of
his
place
and
welcome
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
like
a
young
clergyman
,
in
his
white
cravat
,
but
he
be
very
affable
and
good
-
humoured
;
and
he
show
me
my
place
,
and
present
me
to
the
master
,
in
a
gentlemanly
way
that
would
have
put
me
at
my
ease
,
if
anything
could
.
   
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
so
long
,
however
,
since
I
have
be
among
such
boy
,
or
among
any
companion
of
my
own
age
,
except
Mick
Walker
and
Mealy
Potatoes
,
that
I
feel
as
strange
as
ever
<EOS>
I
have
do
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
conscious
of
have
pass
through
scene
of
which
they
could
have
no
knowledge
,
and
of
have
acquire
experience
foreign
to
my
age
,
appearance
,
and
condition
as
one
of
them
,
that
I
half
believe
it
be
an
imposture
to
come
there
as
an
ordinary
little
schoolboy
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
become
,
in
the
Murdstone
and
Grinby
time
,
<EOS>
however
short
or
long
it
may
have
be
,
so
unused
to
the
sport
and
game
of
boy
<EOS>
,
that
I
know
I
be
awkward
and
inexperienced
in
the
common
thing
belong
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
I
have
learn
,
have
so
slip
away
from
me
in
the
sordid
care
of
my
life
from
day
to
night
,
that
now
,
when
I
be
examine
about
what
I
know
,
I
know
nothing
,
and
be
put
into
the
low
form
of
the
school
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
trouble
as
I
be
,
by
my
want
of
boyish
skill
,
and
of
book
-
learning
too
,
I
be
make
infinitely
more
uncomfortable
by
the
consideration
,
that
,
in
what
I
do
know
,
I
be
much
farther
remove
from
my
companion
than
in
what
I
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
My
mind
run
upon
what
they
would
think
,
if
they
know
of
my
familiar
acquaintance
with
the
King
's
Bench
Prison
?
 
<EOS>
be
there
anything
about
me
which
would
reveal
my
proceeding
in
connexion
with
the
Micawber
family
---
all
those
pawning
,
and
selling
,
and
supper
---
in
spite
of
myself
?
<EOS>
suppose
some
of
the
boy
have
see
me
come
through
Canterbury
,
wayworn
and
ragged
,
and
should
find
me
out
?
 
<EOS>
what
would
they
say
,
who
make
so
light
of
money
,
if
they
could
know
how
I
have
scrape
my
halfpence
together
,
for
the
purchase
of
my
daily
saveloy
and
beer
,
or
<EOS>
my
slice
of
pudding
?
 
<EOS>
how
would
it
affect
them
,
who
be
so
innocent
of
London
life
,
and
London
street
,
to
discover
how
know
I
be
(
and
be
ashamed
to
be
)
in
some
of
the
mean
phase
of
both
?
 
<EOS>
all
this
run
in
my
head
so
much
,
on
that
first
day
at
Doctor
Strong
's
,
that
I
feel
distrustful
of
my
slight
look
and
gesture
;
shrink
within
myself
whensoever
I
be
approach
by
one
of
my
new
schoolfellow
;
and
hurry
off
the
minute
school
be
over
,
afraid
of
commit
myself
in
my
response
to
any
friendly
notice
or
advance
.
   
<EOS>
but
there
be
such
an
influence
in
Mr
Wickfield
's
old
house
,
that
when
I
knock
at
it
,
with
my
new
school
-
book
under
my
arm
,
I
begin
to
feel
my
uneasiness
soften
away
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
go
up
to
my
airy
old
room
,
the
grave
shadow
of
the
staircase
seem
to
fall
upon
my
doubt
and
fear
,
and
to
make
the
past
more
indistinct
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
there
,
sturdily
con
my
book
,
until
dinner
-
time
<EOS>
(
we
be
out
of
school
for
good
at
three
)
;
and
go
down
,
hopeful
of
become
a
passable
sort
of
boy
yet
.
   
<EOS>
Agnes
be
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
wait
for
her
father
,
who
be
detain
by
someone
in
his
office
.
 
<EOS>
She
meet
me
with
her
pleasant
smile
,
and
ask
me
how
I
like
the
school
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
I
should
like
it
very
much
,
I
hope
;
but
I
be
a
little
strange
to
it
at
first
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
never
be
to
school
,
"
I
say
,
"
have
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
yes
!
 
<EOS>
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
but
you
mean
here
,
at
your
own
home
?
"
   
"
Papa
could
not
spare
me
to
go
anywhere
else
,
"
she
answer
,
smile
and
shake
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
housekeeper
must
be
in
his
house
,
you
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
be
very
fond
of
you
,
I
be
sure
,
"
I
say
.
   
<EOS>
She
nod
"
yes
,
"
and
go
to
the
door
to
listen
for
his
come
up
,
that
she
may
meet
him
on
the
stair
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
he
be
not
there
,
she
come
back
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mama
have
be
dead
ever
since
I
be
bear
,
"
she
say
,
in
her
quiet
way
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
only
know
her
picture
,
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
you
look
at
it
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
think
whose
it
be
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
tell
her
yes
,
because
it
be
so
like
herself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Papa
say
so
,
too
,
"
say
Agnes
,
please
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hark
!
 
<EOS>
that
be
papa
now
!
"
   
<EOS>
Her
bright
calm
face
light
up
with
pleasure
as
she
go
to
meet
him
,
and
as
they
come
in
,
hand
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
greet
me
cordially
;
and
tell
me
I
should
certainly
be
happy
under
Doctor
Strong
,
who
be
one
of
the
gentle
of
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
there
may
be
some
,
perhaps
---
I
do
not
know
that
there
be
---
who
abuse
his
kindness
,
"
say
Mr
Wickfield
.
 
<EOS>
"
never
be
one
of
those
,
Trotwood
,
in
anything
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
the
least
suspicious
of
mankind
;
and
whether
that
be
a
merit
,
or
whether
it
be
a
blemish
,
it
deserve
consideration
in
all
dealing
with
the
doctor
,
great
or
small
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
speak
,
I
think
,
as
if
he
be
weary
,
or
dissatisfy
with
something
;
but
I
do
not
pursue
the
question
in
my
mind
,
for
dinner
be
just
then
announce
,
and
we
go
down
and
take
the
same
seat
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
scarcely
do
so
,
when
Uriah
Heep
put
in
his
red
head
and
his
lank

Mr

<EOS>
as
he
hold
the

open
with
his

Uriah
look
at
me

and
look
at
Agnes

look
at
the

look
at

and
look
at
every
object
in

I
think
,

yet
seem
to
look
at
nothing

he
make
such
an
appearance
all
the
while
of
keep
his
red
eye
dutifully
on
his
master

<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon

<EOS>
It
be
only
to
say
,
on
reflection
,
"
observe
a
voice
behind
Uriah
,
as
Uriah
's
head
be
push
away
,
and
the
speaker
's
substitute
---
"
pray
excuse
me
for
this
intrusion

that
as
it
seem
I
have
no
choice
in
the
matter
,
the
sooner
I
go
abroad
the
well

<EOS>
My
cousin
Annie
do
say
,
when
we
talk
of
it
,
that
she
like
to
have
her
friend
within
reach
rather
than
to
have
them
banish
,
and
the
old
Doctor

"
   
"
Doctor
Strong

be
that
?
"
<EOS>
Mr
Wickfield
interpose
,
gravely
.
   
<EOS>
"
Doctor
Strong

of
course

return
the

"
I
call
him
the

it

all
the

you

I

Mr

<EOS>
"
well

Doctor
Strong

the
other

"
Doctor
Strong
be
of
the

mind

I
believe

<EOS>
but
as
it
appear
from
the
course
you
take
with
me
he
have
change
his
mind
,
why
there
be
no
more
to
be
say
,
except
that
the
sooner
I
be
off
,
the
well
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
I
think
I
would
come
back
and
say
,
that
the
sooner
I
be
off
the
well

<EOS>
when
a
plunge
be
to

make
into

there
shall

be
not
a

otherwise
,
I
dare
say
,
my
cousin
Annie
could
easily
arrange
it
in
her

I
suppose
Annie
would
only
have
to
say
to
the

no

to

Mr

<EOS>
but
appear
to
remark
that
Mr
Wickfield
go
on
with
his
dinner
in
the
same
sedate
,
immovable
manner
,
and
that
there
be
no
hope
of
make
him
relax
a
muscle
of
his

,
he
add
:

however
,
I
have
say
what

,
with
another
apology

may
take
myself
off

<EOS>
of

I
shall
observe
your

consider
the

one
to

arrange

up

have
you
dine

motion

his

towards
the

"
Thank'ee

Mr

"
with
my

<EOS>
good
-
bye

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Wickfield
,
without
rise
,
look
after
him
thoughtfully
as
he
go
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
rather
a
shallow
sort
of
young
gentleman
,
I
think
,
with
a
handsome
face
,
a
rapid
utterance
,
and
a
confident
,
bold
air
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
be
the
first
I
ever
see
of
Mr
Jack
Maldon
;
whom
I
have
not
expect
to
see
so
soon
,
when
I
hear
the
Doctor
speak
of
him
that
morning
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
have
dine
,
we
go
upstairs
again
,
where
everything
go
on
exactly
as
on
the
previous
day
.
 
<EOS>
agne
set
the
glass
and
decanter
in
the
same
corner
,
and
Mr
Wickfield
sit
down
to
drink
,
and
drank
a
good
deal
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
play
the
piano
to
him
,
sit
by
him
,
and
work
and
talk
,
and
play
some
game
at
domino
with
me
.
<EOS>
in
good
time
she
make
tea
;
and
afterwards
,
when
I
bring
down
my
book
,
look
into
them
,
and
show
me
what
she
know
of
them
(
which
be
no
slight
matter
,
though
she
say
it
be
)
,
and
what
be
the
good
way
to
learn
and
understand
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
her
,
with
her
modest
,
orderly
,
placid
manner
,
and
I
hear
her
beautiful
calm
voice
,
as
I
write
these
word
.
 
<EOS>
the
influence
for
all
good
,
which
she
come
to
exercise
over
me
at
a
later
time
,
begin
already
to
descend
upon
my
breast
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
little
em'ly
,
and
I
do
not
love
agne
---
<EOS>
no
,
not
at
all
in
that
way
<EOS>
---
but
I
feel
that
there
be
goodness
,
peace
,
and
truth
,
wherever
Agnes
be
;
and
that
the
soft
light
of
the
colour
window
in
the
church
,
see
long
ago
,
fall
on
her
always
,
and
on
me
when
I
be
near
her
,
and
on
everything
around
.
   
<EOS>
the
time
have
come
for
her
withdrawal
for
the
night
,
and
she
have
leave
us
,
I
give
Mr
Wickfield
my
hand
,
preparatory
to
go
away
myself
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
check
me
and
say
:
"
Should
you
like
to
stay
with
us
,
Trotwood
,
or
to
go
elsewhere
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
to
stay
,
"
I
answer
,
quickly
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
sure
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
may
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
it
be
but
<EOS>
a
dull
life
that
we
lead
here
<EOS>
,
boy
,
I
be
afraid
,
"
he
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
not
more
dull
for
me
than
Agnes
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
not
dull
at
all
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
than
agne
,
"
he
repeat
,
walk
slowly
to
the
great
chimney
-
piece
,
and
lean
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
than
agne
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
have
drink
wine
that
evening
<EOS>
(
or
I
fancy
it
)
,
until
his
eye
be
bloodshot
.
 
<EOS>
not
that
I
could
see
them
now
,
for
they
be
cast
down
,
and
shade
by
his
hand
;
but
I
have
notice
them
a
little
while
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
I
wonder
,
"
he
mutter
,
"
whether
my
Agnes
tire
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
when
should
I
ever
tire
of
her
!
 
<EOS>
but
that
be
different
<EOS>
,
that
be
quite
different
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
be
muse
,
not
speak
to
me
;
so
I
remain
quiet
.
   
<EOS>
"
a
dull
old
house
,
"
he
say
,
"
and
a
monotonous
life
;
but
I
must
have
her
near
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
keep
her
near
me
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
thought
that
I
may
die
and
leave
my
darling
,
or
that
my
darling
may
die
and
leave
me
,
come
like
a
spectre
,
to
distress
my
happy
hour
,
and
be
only
to
be
drown
in
---
"
   
<EOS>
He
do
not
supply
the
word
;
but
pace
slowly
to
the
place
where
he
have
sit
,
and
mechanically
go
through
the
action
of
pour
wine
from
the
empty
decanter
,
set
it
down
and
pace
back
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
miserable
to
bear
,
when
she
be
here
,
"
he
say
,
"
what
would
it
be
,
and
she
away
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
try
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
lean
against
the
chimney
-
piece
,
brood
so
long
that
I
could
not
decide
whether
to
run
the
risk
of
disturb
him
by
go
,
or
to
remain
quietly
where
I
be
,
until
he
should
come
out
of
his
reverie
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
he
arouse
himself
,
and
look
about
the
room
until
his
eye
encounter
mine
.
   
<EOS>
"
stay
with
us
,
Trotwood
,
eh
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
in
his
usual
manner
,
and
as
if
he
be
answer
something
I
have
just
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
of
it
.
<EOS>
You
be
company
to
us
both
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
wholesome
to
have
you
here
.
<EOS>
Wholesome
for
me
,
wholesome
for
agne
,
wholesome
perhaps
for
all
of
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
it
be
for
me
,
sir
,
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
glad
to
be
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
fine
fellow
!
"
say
Mr
Wickfield
.
 
<EOS>
"
as
long
as
you
be
glad
to
be
here
,
you
shall
stay
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
shake
hand
with
me
upon
it
,
and
clap
me
on
the
back
;
and
tell
me
that
when
I
have
anything
to
do
at
night
after
Agnes
have
leave
us
,
or
when
I
wish
to
read
for
my
own
pleasure
,
I
be
free
to
come
down
to
his
room
,
if
he
be
there
<EOS>
and
if
I
desire
it
for
company
's
sake
,
and
to
sit
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
thank
him
for
his
consideration
;
and
,
as
he
go
down
soon
afterwards
,
and
I
be
not
tired
,
go
down
too
,
with
a
book
in
my
hand
,
to
avail
myself
,
for
half
-
an
-
hour
,
of
his
permission
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
see
a
light
in
the
little
round
office
,
and
immediately
feel
myself
attract
towards
Uriah
Heep
,
who
have
a
sort
of
fascination
for
me
<EOS>
,
I
go
in
there
instead
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
Uriah
read
a
great
fat
book
,
with
such
demonstrative
attention
,
that
his
lank
forefinger
follow
up
every
line
as
he
read
,
and
make
clammy
track
along
the
page
(
or
so
I
fully
believe
)
like
a
snail
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
work
late
tonight
,
Uriah
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
say
Uriah
.
   
<EOS>
as
I
be
get
on
the
stool
opposite
,
to
talk
to
him
more
conveniently
,
I
observe
that
he
have
not
such
a
thing
as
a
smile
about
him
,
and
that
he
could
only
widen
his
mouth
and
make
two
hard
crease
down
his
cheek
,
one
on
each
side
,
to
stand
for
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
do
office
-
work
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
say
Uriah
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
work
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
improve
my
legal
knowledge
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
say
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
through
Tidd
's
Practice
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
what
a
writer
Mr
Tidd
be
,
Master
Copperfield
!
"
   
<EOS>
My
stool
be
such
a
tower
of
observation
,
that
as
I
watch
him
read
on
again
,
after
this
rapturous
exclamation
,
and
follow
up
the
line
with
his
forefinger
,
I
observe
that
his
nostril
,
which
be
thin
and
pointed
,
with
sharp
dint
in
them
,
have
a
singular
and
most
uncomfortable
way
of
expand
and
contract
themselves
---
that
they
seem
to
twinkle
instead
of
his
eye
,
which
hardly
ever
twinkle
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
be
quite
a
great
lawyer
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
after
look
at
him
for
some
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
Me
,
Master
Copperfield
?
"
say
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
very
umble
person
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
no
fancy
of
mine
about
his
hand
,
I
observe
;
for
he
frequently
grind
the
palm
against
each
other
as
if
to
squeeze
them
dry
and
warm
,
besides
often
wipe
them
,
in
a
stealthy
way
,
on
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
well
aware
that
I
be
the
umblest
person
go
,
"
say
Uriah
Heep
,
modestly
;
"
let
the
other
be
where
he
may

<EOS>
My
mother

likewise
a
very
umble
person

<EOS>
We
live
in
a
numble
abode

Master
Copperfield

much
to

I
ask

how
much
have
I
to

Mr

<EOS>
I
ask

<EOS>
Being
,
at
last
,
ready
to
leave
the
office
for
the
night
<EOS>
,
he
ask
me
if
it
would
suit
my
convenience
to
have
the
light
put
out
;
and
on
my
answering
"
yes

"
instantly
extinguish
it
.
 
<EOS>
after
shake
hand
with
me
---
his
hand
feel
like
a
fish
,
in
the
dark
---
he
open
the
door
into
the
street
a
very
little
,
and
creep
out
,
and
shut
it
,
leave
me
to
grope
my
way
back
into
the
house
:
which
cost
me
some
trouble
and
a
fall
over
his
stool
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
proximate
cause
,
I
suppose
,
of
my
dream
about
him
,
for
what
appear
to
me
to
be
half
the
night
;
and
dream
,
among
other
thing
,
that
he
have
launch
Mr
Peggotty
's
house
on
a
piratical
expedition
,
with
a
black
flag
at
the
masthead
,
bear
the
inscription
"
Tidd
's
Practice
"
,
under
which
diabolical
ensign
he
be
carry
me
and
little
em'ly
to
the
Spanish
Main
,
to
be
drown
.
   
<EOS>
I
get
a
little
the
well
of
my
uneasiness
when
I
go
to
school
next
day
,
and
a
good
deal
the
well
next
day
,
and
so
shake
it
off
by
degree
,
that
in
less
than
a
fortnight
<EOS>
I
be
quite
at
home
,
and
happy
,
among
my
new
companion
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
awkward
enough
in
their
game
,
and
backward
enough
in
their
study
;
but
custom
would
improve
me
in
the
first
respect
,
I
hope
,
and
hard
work
in
the
second
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
I
go
to
work
very
hard
,
both
in
play
and
in
earnest
,
and
gain
great
commendation
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
in
a
very
little
while
,
the
Murdstone
and
Grinby
life
become
so
strange
to
me
that
I
hardly
believe
in
it
,
while
my
present
life
grow
so
familiar
,
that
I
seem
to
have

it
a
long

<EOS>
Doctor
Strong
's
be
an
excellent
school
;
as
different
from
Mr
Creakle
's
as
good
be
from
evil
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
gravely
and
decorously
order
,
and
on
a
sound
system
;
with
an
appeal
,
in
everything
,
to
the
honour
and
good
faith
of
the
boy
,
and
an
avow
intention
to
rely
on
their
possession
of
those
quality
unless
they
prove
themselves
unworthy
of
it
,
which
work
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
feel
that
we
have
a
part
in
the
management
of
the
place
,
and
in
sustain
its
character
and
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
hence
,
we
soon
become
warmly
attach
to
it
<EOS>
---
I
be
sure
I
do
for
one
,
and
I
never
know
,
in
all
my
time
,
of
any
other
boy
be
otherwise
---
and
learn
with
a
good
will
,
desire
to
do
it
credit
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
noble
game
out
of
hour
,
and
plenty
of
liberty
;
but
even
then
,
as
I
remember
,
we
be
well
speak
of
in
the
town
,
and
rarely
do
any
disgrace
,
by
our
appearance
or
manner
,
to
the
reputation
of
Doctor
Strong
and
Doctor
Strong
's
boy
.
   
<EOS>
some
of
the
high
scholar
board
in
the
Doctor
's
house
,
and
through
them
I
learn
,
at
second
hand
,
some
particular
of
the
Doctor
's
history
---
as
,
how
he
have
not
yet
be
marry
twelve
month
to
the
beautiful
young
lady
I
have
see
in
the
study
,
whom
he
have
marry
for
love
;
for
she
have
not
a
sixpence
,
and
have
a
world
of
poor
relation
(
so
our
fellow
say
)
ready
to
swarm
the
Doctor
out
of
house
and
home
.
 
<EOS>
also
,
how
the
Doctor
's
cogitate
manner
be
attributable
to
his
be
always
engage
in
look
out
for
greek
root
;
which
,
in
my
innocence
and
ignorance
,
I
suppose
to
be
a
botanical
furor
on
the
Doctor
's
part
,
especially
as
he
always
look
at
the
ground
when
he
walk
about
,
until
I
understand
that
they
be
root
of
word
,
with
a
view
to
a
new
Dictionary
which
he
have
in
contemplation
.
 
<EOS>
Adams
,
our
head
-
boy
,
who
have
a
turn
for
mathematic
,
have
make
a
calculation
,
I
be
inform
,
of
the
time
this
Dictionary
would
take
in
complete
,
on
the
doctor
's
plan
,
and
at
the
Doctor
's
rate
of
go
.
 
<EOS>
He
consider
that
it
may
be
do
in
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
forty
-
nine
year
,
count
from
the
Doctor
's
last
,
or
sixty
-
second
,
birthday
.
   
<EOS>
but
the
Doctor
himself
be
the
idol
of
the
whole
school
:
and
it
must
have
be
a
badly
compose
school
if
he
have
be
anything
else
,
for
he
be
the
kind
of
man
;
with
a
simple
faith
in
him
that
may
have
touch
the
stone
heart
of
the
very
urn
upon
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
walk
up
and
down
that
part
of
the
courtyard
which
be
at
the
side
of
the
house
,
with
the
stray
rook
and
jackdaw
look
after
him
with
their
head
cock
slyly
,
as
if
they
know
how
much
more
know
they
be
in
worldly
affair
than
he
,
if
any
sort
of
vagabond
could
only
get
near
enough
to
his
creaking
shoe
to
attract
his
attention
to
one
sentence
of
a
tale
of
distress
,
that
vagabond
be
make
for
the
next
two
day
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
notorious
in
the
house
,
that
the
master
and
head
-
boy
take
pain
to
cut
these
marauder
off
at
angle
,
and
to
get
out
of
window
,
and
turn
them
out
of
the
courtyard
,
before
they
could
make
the
doctor
aware
of
their
presence
;
which
be
sometimes
happily
effect
within
a
few
yard
of
him
,
without
his
know
anything
of
the
matter
,
as
he
jog
to
and
fro
.
 
<EOS>
outside
his
own
domain
,
and
unprotected
,
he
be
a
very
sheep
for
the
shearer
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
take
his
gaiter
off
his
leg
,
to
give
away
.
 
<EOS>
in
fact
,
there
be
a
story
current
among
us
<EOS>
(
I
have
no
idea
,
and
never
have
,
on
what
authority
,
but
I
have
believe
it
for
so
many
year
that
I
feel
quite
certain
it
be
true
)
,
that
on
a
frosty
day
,
one
winter
-
time
,
he
actually
do
bestow
his
gaiter
on
a
beggar
-
woman
,
who
occasion
some
scandal
in
the
neighbourhood
by
exhibit
a
fine
infant
from
door
to
door
,
wrap
in
those
garment
,
which
be
universally
recognize
,
be
as
well
know
in
the
vicinity
as
the
Cathedral
.
 
<EOS>
the
legend
add
that
the
only
person
who
do
not
identify
them
be
the
Doctor
himself
,
who
,
when
they
be
shortly
afterwards
display
at
the
door
of
a
little
second
-
hand
shop
of
no
very
good
repute
,
where
such
thing
be
take
in
exchange
for
gin
,
be
more
than
once
observe
to
handle
them
approvingly
,
as
if
admire
some
curious
novelty
in
the
pattern
,
and
consider
them
an
improvement
on
his
own
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
very
pleasant
to
see
the
doctor
with
his
pretty
young
wife
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
fatherly
,
benignant
way
of
show
his
fondness
for
her
,
which
seem
in
itself
to
express
a
good
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
often
see
them
walk
in
the
garden
where
the
peach
be
,
and
I
sometimes
have
a
near
observation
of
them
in
the
study
or
the
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
She
appear
to
me
to
take
great
care
of
the
Doctor
,
and
to
like
him
very
much
,
though
I
never
think
her
vitally
interested
in
the
Dictionary
:
some
cumbrous
fragment
of
which
work
the
Doctor
always
carry
in
his
pocket
,
and
in
the
lining
of
his
hat
,
and
generally
seem
to
be
expound
to
her
as
they
walk
about
.
   
<EOS>
I
see
a
good
deal
of
Mrs
Strong
,
both
because
she
have
take
a
liking
for
me
on
the
morning
of
my
introduction
to
the
Doctor
,
and
be
always
afterwards
kind
to
me
,
and
interested
in
me
;
and
because
she
be
very
fond
of
agne
,
and
be
often
backwards
and
forwards
at
our
house
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
curious
constraint
between
her
and
Mr
Wickfield
,
I
think
(
of
whom
she
seem
to
be
afraid
)
,
that
never
wear
off
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
come
there
of
an
evening
,
she
always
shrink
from
accept
his
escort
home
,
and
run
away
with
me
instead
.
 
<EOS>
and
sometimes
,
as
we
be
run
gaily
across
the
cathedral
yard
together
,
expect
to
meet
nobody
,
we
would
meet
Mr
Jack
Maldon
,
who
be
always
surprised
to
see
us
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Strong
's
mama
be
a
lady
I
take
great
delight
in
.
 
<EOS>
Her
name
be
Mrs
Markleham
;
but
our
boy
use
to
call
her
the
Old
Soldier
,
on
account
of
her
generalship
,
and
the
skill
with
which
she
marshal
great
force
of
relation
against
the
Doctor
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
little
,
sharp
-
eyed
woman
,
who
use
to
wear
,
when
she
be
dress
,
one
unchangeable
cap
,
ornament
with
some
artificial
flower
,
and
two
artificial
butterfly
suppose
to
be
hover
above
the
flower
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
superstition
among
us
that
this
cap
have
come
from
France
,
and
could
only
originate
in
the
workmanship
of
that
ingenious
nation
:
but
all
I
certainly
know
about
it
,
be
,
that
it
always
make
its
appearance
of
an
evening
,
wheresoever
Mrs
Markleham
make
her
appearance
;
that
it
be
carry
about
to
friendly
meeting
in
a
Hindoo
basket
;
that
the
butterfly
have
the
gift
of
tremble
constantly
;
and
that
they
improve
the
shine
hour
at
Doctor
Strong
's
expense
,
like
busy
bee
.
   
<EOS>
I
observe
the
Old
Soldier
---
not

I
can

put
down

shall
begin

then
I
speak

settle

then
,

not

then

I

to
Annie

"
Annie
,
Doctor
Strong
will
not
only
be
your
husband

he
will
represent
your
late
father

he
will
represent
the
head
of
our
family
,
he
will
represent
the
wisdom
and
station
,
and
I
may
say
the
mean
,
of
our
family
;
and
will
be
,
in
short
,
a
Boon
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
use
the
word
at
the
time
,

I
have
use
it
again
,
today

<EOS>
if
I
have
any
merit
it
be
consistency

"
   
<EOS>
the
daughter
have
sit
quite
silent
and
still
during
this
speech
,
with
her
eye
fix
on
the
ground
;
her
cousin
stand
near
her
,
and
look
on
the
ground
too
.
 
<EOS>
She
now
say
very
softly
,
in
a
tremble
voice
:
   
<EOS>
"
Mama
,
I
hope
you
have
finish
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
my
dear
Annie
,
"
return
the
Old
Soldier
,
"
I
have
not
quite
finish
.
 
<EOS>
since
you
ask
me
,
my
love
,
I
reply
that
I
have
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
complain
that
you
really
be
a
little
unnatural
towards
your
own
family
;
and
,
as
it
be
of
no
use
complain
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
to
complain
to
your
husband
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
my
dear
doctor
,
do
look
at
that
silly
wife
of
yours
.
"
   
<EOS>
as
the
Doctor
turn
his
kind
face
,
with
its
smile
of
simplicity
and
gentleness
,
towards
her
,
she
droop
her
head
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
notice
that
Mr
Wickfield
look
at
her
steadily
.
   
<EOS>
"
when
I
happen
to
say
to
that
naughty
thing
,
the
other
day
,
"
pursue
her
mother
,
shake
her
head
and
her
fan
at
her
,
playfully
,
"
that
there
be
a
family
circumstance
she
may
mention
to
you
---
indeed
,
I
think
,
be
bind
to
mention
---
she
say
,
that
to
mention
it
be
to
ask
a
favour
;
and
that
,
as
you
be
too
generous
,
and
as
for
her
to
ask
be
always
to
have
,
she
would
not
.

<EOS>
"
Annie
,
my
dear
,

the
Doctor

<EOS>
"
that
be
wrong

<EOS>
It
rob
me
of
a
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
almost
the
very
word
I
say
to
her
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
her
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
now
really
,
another
time
,
when
I
know
what
she
would
tell
you
but
for
this
reason
,
and
will
not
,
I
have
a
great
mind
,
my
dear
Doctor
,
to
tell
you
myself

<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
glad
if
you
will

the
Doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
certainly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
I
will
!
"
say
the
Old
Soldier
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
bargain
.
"
<EOS>
and
have
,
I
suppose
,
carry
her
point
,
she
tap
the
Doctor
's
hand
several
time
with
her
fan
(
which
she
kiss
first
)
,
and
return
triumphantly
to
her
former
station
.
   
<EOS>
some
more
company
come
in
,
among
whom
be
the
two
master
and
Adams
,
the
talk
become
general
;
and
it
naturally
turn
on
Mr
Jack
Maldon
,
and
his
voyage
,
and
the
country
he
be
go
to
,
and
his
various
plan
and
prospect
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
to
leave
that
night
,
after
supper
,
in
a
post
-
chaise
,
for
Gravesend
;
where
the
ship
,
in
which
he
be
to
make
the
voyage
,
lie
;
and
be
to
be
go
---
unless
he
come
home
on
leave
,
or
for
his
health
<EOS>
---
I
do
not
know
<EOS>
how
many
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
recollect
it
be
settle
by
general
consent
that
India
be
quite
a
misrepresented
country
,
and
have
nothing
objectionable
in
it
,
but
a
tiger
or
two
,
and
a
little
heat
in
the
warm
part
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
look
on
Mr
Jack
Maldon
as
a
modern
Sindbad
,
and
picture
him
the
bosom
friend
of
all
the
Rajahs
in
the
East
,
sit
under
canopy
,
smoke
curly
golden
pipe
---
a
mile
long
,
if
they
could
be
straighten
out
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Strong
be
a
very
pretty
singer
:
as
I
know
,
who
often
hear
her
singing
by
herself
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
whether
she
be
afraid
of
singe
before
people
,
or
be
out
of
voice
that
evening
,
it
be
certain
that
she
could
not
sing
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
She
try
a
duet
,
once
,
with
her
cousin
Maldon
,
but
could
not
so
much
as
begin
;
and
afterwards
,
when
she
try
to
sing
by
herself
,
although
she
begin
sweetly
,
her
voice
die
away
on
a
sudden
,
and
leave
her
quite
distressed
,
with
her
head
hang
down
over
the
key
.
 
<EOS>
the
good
doctor
say
she
be
nervous
,
and
,
to
relieve
her
,
propose
a
round
game
at
card
;
of
which
he
know
as
much
as
of
the
art
of
play
the
trombone
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
remark
that
the
Old
Soldier
take
him
into
custody
directly
,
for
her
partner
;
and
instruct
him
,
as
the
first
preliminary
of
initiation
,
to
give
her
all
the
silver
he
have
in
his
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
a
merry
game
,
not
make
the
less
merry
by
the
Doctor
's
mistake
,
of
which
he
commit
an
innumerable
quantity
,
in
spite
of
the
watchfulness
of
the
butterfly
,
and
to
their
great
aggravation
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Strong
have
decline
to
play
,
on
the
ground
of
not
feel
very
well
;
and
her
cousin
Maldon
have
excuse
himself
because
he
have
some
packing
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
do
it
,
however
,
he
return
,
and
they
sit
together
,
talk
,
on
the
sofa
.
 
<EOS>
from
time
to
time
she
come
and
look
over
the
Doctor
's
hand
,
and
tell
him
what
to
play
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
very
pale
,
as
she
bend
over
him
,
and
I
think
her
finger
tremble
as
she
point
out
the
card
;
but
the
Doctor
be
quite
happy
in
her
attention
,
and
take
no
notice
of
this
,
if
it
be
so
.
   
<EOS>
at
supper
,
we
be
hardly
so
gay
.
 
<EOS>
everyone
appear
to
feel
that
a
parting
of
that
sort
be
an
awkward
thing
,
and
that
the
nearer
it
approach
,
the
more
awkward
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jack
Maldon
try
to
be
very
talkative
,
but
be
not
at
his
ease
,
and
make
matter
bad
.
<EOS>
and
they
be
not
improve
,
as
it
appear
to
me
,
by
the
Old
Soldier
:
who
continually
recall
passage
of
Mr
Jack
Maldon
's
youth
.
   
<EOS>
the
Doctor
,
however
,
who
feel
,
I
be
sure
,
that
he
be
make
everybody
happy
,
be
well
pleased
,
and
have
no
suspicion
<EOS>
but
that
we
be
all
at
the
utmost
height
of
enjoyment
.

"

<EOS>
Mr

Maldon

you

and
bring

upon
thousand
happily
back

<EOS>
"
It
be
an
affect
thing
,
"
say
Mrs
Markleham
---
"
<EOS>
however
it
be
view
,
it
be
affect
,
to
see
a
fine
young
man
one
have
know
from
an
infant
,
go
away
to
the
other
end
of
the
world
,
leave
all
he
know
behind
,
and
not
know
what
be
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
a
young
man
really
well
deserve
constant
support
and
patronage
,
"
look
at
the
Doctor
,
"
who
make
such
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Time
will
go
fast
with
you

Mr
Jack
Maldon
,
"
pursue
the

"
and
fast
with
all
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
us
can
hardly
expect
,
perhaps
,
in
the
natural
course
of
thing
,
to
greet
you
on
your
return
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
good
thing
be
to
hope
to
do
it
,
and
that
be
my
case
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
not
weary
you
with
good
advice
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
long
have
a
good
model
before
you
,
in
your
cousin
Annie
.
 
<EOS>
imitate
her
virtue
as
nearly
as
you
can

<EOS>
Mrs
Markleham
fan
herself
,
and
shake
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Farewell
,
Mr
Jack
,
"
say
the
Doctor
,
stand
up
;
on
which
we
all
stand
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
prosperous
voyage
out
,
a
thriving
career
abroad
,
and
a
happy
return
home
!
"
   
<EOS>
We
all
drank
the
toast
,
and
all
shake
hand
with
Mr
Jack
Maldon
;
after
which
he
hastily
take
leave
of
the
lady
who
be
there
,
and
hurry
to
the
door
,
where
he
be
receive
,
as
he
get
into
the
chaise
,
with
a
tremendous
broadside
of
cheer
discharge
by
our
boy
,
who
have
assemble
on
the
lawn
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
run
in
among
them
to
swell
the
rank
,
I
be
very
near
the
chaise
when
it
roll
away
;
and
I
have
a
lively
impression
make
upon
me
,
in
the
midst
of
the
noise
and
dust
,
of
have
see
Mr
Jack
Maldon
rattle
past
with
an
agitated
face
,
and
something
cherry
-
colour
in
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
after
another
broadside
for
the
Doctor
,
and
another
for
the
Doctor
's
wife
,
the
boy
disperse
,
and
I
go
back
into
the
house
,
where
I
find
the
guest
all
stand
in
a
group
about
the
doctor
,
discuss
how
Mr
Jack
Maldon
have
go
away
,
and
how
he
have
bear
it
,
and
how
he
have
feel
it
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
these
remark
,
Mrs
Markleham
cry
:
"
where
be
Annie
?
"
   
<EOS>
no
Annie
be
there
;
and
when
they
call
to
her
,
no
Annie
reply
.
<EOS>
but
all
press
out
of
the
room
,
in
a
crowd
,
to
see
what
be
the
matter
,
we
find
her
lie
on
the
hall
floor
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
great
alarm
at
first
,
until
it
be
find
that
she
be
in
a
swoon
,
and
that
the
swoon
be
yield
to
the
usual
mean
of
recovery
;
when
the
Doctor
,
who
have
lift
her
head
upon
his
knee
,
put
her
curl
aside
with
his
hand
,
and
say
,
look
around
:
   
"
Poor
Annie
!
 
<EOS>
She
be
so
faithful
and
tender
-
hearted
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
parting
from
her
old
playfellow
and
friend
---
her
favourite
cousin
<EOS>
---
that
have
do
this
.
 
<EOS>
ah
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
sorry
!
"
   
<EOS>
when
she
open
her
eye
,
and
see
where
she
be
,
and
that
we
be
all
stand
about
her
,
she
arise
with
assistance
:
turn
her
head
,
as
she
do
so
,
to
lay
it
on
the
Doctor
's
shoulder
---
or
to
hide
it
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
know
which
.
 
<EOS>
We
go
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
to
leave
her
with
the
Doctor
and
her
mother
;
but
she
say
,
it
seem
,
that
she
be
well
than
she
have
be
since
morning
,
and
that
she
would
rather
be
bring
among
us
;
<EOS>
so
they
bring
her
in
,
look
very
white
and
weak
,
I
think
,
and
sit
her
on
a
sofa
.
   
<EOS>
"
Annie
,
my
dear
,
"
say
her
mother
,
do
something
to
her
dress
.
<EOS>
"
see
here
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
lose
a
bow
.
 
<EOS>
Will
anybody
be
so
good
as
find
a
ribbon
;
a
cherry
-
coloured
ribbon
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
the
one
she
have
wear
at
her
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
look
for
it
;
I
myself
look
everywhere
<EOS>
,
I
be
certain
---
but
nobody
could
find
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
recollect
where
you
have
it
last
,
Annie
?
"
say
her
mother
.
   
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
I
could
have
think
she
look
white
,
or
<EOS>
anything
but
burn
red
,
when
she
answer
that
she
have
have
it
safe
,
a
little
while
ago
<EOS>
,
she
think
,
but
it
be
not
worth
look
for
.
   
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
it
be
look
for
again
,
and
still
not
find
.
 
<EOS>
She
entreat
that
there
may
be
no
more
searching
;
but
it
be
still
seek
for
,
in
a
desultory
way
,
until
she
be
quite
well
,
and
the
company
take
their
departure
.
   
<EOS>
We
walk
very
slowly
home
,
Mr
Wickfield
,
Agnes
,
and
I
---
<EOS>
Agnes
and
<EOS>
I
admire
the
moonlight
,
and
Mr
Wickfield
scarcely
raise
his
eye
from
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
,
at
last
,
reach
our
own
door
,
Agnes
discover
that
she
have
leave
her
little
reticule
behind
.
<EOS>
delighted
to
be
of
any
service
to
her
,
I
run
back
to
fetch
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
go
into
the
supper
-
room
where
it
have
be
leave
,
which
be
desert
and
dark
.
 
<EOS>
but
a
door
of
communication
between
that
and
the
Doctor
's
study
,
where
there
be
a
light
,
be
open
<EOS>
,
I
pass
on
there
,
to
say
what
I
want
,
and
to
get
a
candle
.
   
<EOS>
the
Doctor
be
sit
in
his
easy
-
chair
by
the
fireside
,
and
his
young
wife
be
on
a
stool
at
his
foot
.
 
<EOS>
the
Doctor
,
with
a
complacent
smile
,
be
read
aloud
some
manuscript
explanation
or
statement
of
a
theory
out
of
that
interminable
Dictionary
,
and
she
be
look
up
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
with
such
a
face
as
I
never
see
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
beautiful
in
its
form
,
it
be
so
ashy
pale
,
it
be
so
fix
in
its
abstraction
<EOS>
,
it
be
so
full
of
a
wild
,
sleep
-
walking
,
dreamy
horror
of
I
do
not
know
what
.
 
<EOS>
the
eye
be
wide
open
,
and
her
brown
hair
fall
in
two
rich
cluster
on
her
shoulder
,
and
on
her
white
dress
,
disorder
by
the
want
of
the
lose
ribbon
.
 
<EOS>
distinctly
as
I
recollect
her
look
,
I
can
not
say
of
what
it
be
expressive
,
I
can
not
even
say
of
what
it
be
expressive
to
me
now
,
rise
again
before
my
old
judgement
.
 
<EOS>
penitence
,
humiliation
,
shame
,
pride
,
love
,
and
trustfulness
<EOS>
---
I
see
them
all
;
and
in
them
all
,
I
see
that
horror
of
I
do
not
know
what
.
   
<EOS>
My
entrance
,
and
my
say
what
I
want
,
rouse
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
disturb
the
Doctor
too
,
for
when
I
go
back
to
replace
the
candle
I
have
take
from
the
table
,
he
be
pat
her
head
,
in
his
fatherly
way
,
and
say
he
be
a
merciless
drone
to
let
her
tempt
him
into
read
on
;
and
he
would
have
her
go
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
but
she
ask
him
,
in
a
rapid
,
urgent
manner
,
to
let
her
stay
---
to
let
her
feel
assured
<EOS>
(
I
hear
her
murmur
some
break
word
to
this
effect
)
that
she
be
in
his
confidence
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
as
she
turn
again
towards
him
,
after
glance
at
me
as
I
leave
the
room
and
go
out
at
the
door
,
I
see
her
cross
her
hand
upon
his
knee
,
and
look
up
at
him
with
the
same
face
,
something
quiet
,
as
he
resume
his
reading
.
   
<EOS>
It
make
a
great
impression
on
me
,
and
I
remember
it
a
long
time
afterwards
;
as
I
shall
have
occasion
to
narrate
when
the
time
come
.
      
<EOS>
Chapter
17
.
<EOS>
somebody
turn
up
 
It
have
not
occur
to
me
to
mention
Peggotty
since
I
run
away
;
but
,
of
course
,
I
write
her
a
letter
almost
as
soon
as
I
be
house
at
Dover
,
and
another
,
and
a
long
letter
,
contain
all
particular
fully
relate
,
when
my
aunt
take
me
formally
under
her
protection
.
 
<EOS>
on
my
being
settle
at
Doctor
Strong
's
I
write
to
her
again
,
detail
my
happy
condition
and
prospect
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
could
have
derive
anything
like
the
pleasure
from
spend
the
money
Mr
Dick
have
give
me
,
that
I
feel
in
send
a
gold
half
-
guinea
to
Peggotty
,
per
post
,
enclose
in
this
last
letter
,
to
discharge
the
sum
I
have
borrow
of
her
:
in
which
epistle
,
not
before
,
I
mention
about
the
young
man
with
the
donkey
-
cart
.
   
<EOS>
to
these
communication
<EOS>
Peggotty
reply
as
promptly
,
if
not
as
concisely
,
as
a
merchant
's
clerk
.
 
<EOS>
Her
utmost
power
of
expression
(
which
be
certainly
not
great
in
ink
)
be
exhaust
in
the
attempt
to
write
what
she
feel
on
the
subject
of
my
journey
.
 
<EOS>
four
side
of
incoherent
and
interjectional
beginning
of
sentence
,
that
have
no
end
,
except
blot
,
be
inadequate
to
afford
her
any
relief
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
blot
be
more
expressive
to
me
than
the
good
composition
;
for
they
show
me
that
Peggotty
have
be
cry
all
over
the
paper
,
and
what
could
I
have
desire
more
?
   
<EOS>
I
make
out
,
without
much
difficulty
,
that
she
could
not
take
quite
kindly
to
my
aunt
yet
.
 
<EOS>
the
notice
be
too
short
after
so
long
a
prepossession
the
other
way
.
 
<EOS>
We
never
know
a
person
,
she
write
;
but
to
think
that
Miss
Betsey
should
seem
to
be
so
different
from
what
she
have
be
think
to
be
,
be
a
Moral
!
<EOS>
---
that
be
her
word
.
<EOS>
She
be
evidently
still
afraid
of
Miss
Betsey
,
for
she
send
her
grateful
duty
to
her
but
timidly
;
and
she
be
evidently
afraid
of
me
,
too
,
and
entertain
the
probability
of
my
run
away
again
soon
:
if
I
may
judge
from
the
repeat
hint
she
throw
out
,
that
the
coach
-
fare
to
Yarmouth
be
always
to
be
have
of
her
for
the
asking
.
   
<EOS>
She
give
me
one
piece
of
intelligence
which
affect
me
very
much
,
namely
,
that
there
have
be
a
sale
of
the
furniture
at
our
old
home
,
and
that
Mr
and
Miss
Murdstone
be
go
away
,
and
the
house
be
shut
up
,
to
be
let
or
sell
.
 
<EOS>
God
know
I
have
no
part
in
it
while
they
remain
there
,
but
it
pain
me
to
think
of
the
dear
old
place
as
altogether
abandon
;
of
the
weed
grow
tall
in
the
garden
,
and
the
fall
leave
lie
thick
and
wet
upon
the
path
.
<EOS>
I
imagine
how
the
wind
of
winter
would
howl
round
it
,
how
the
cold
rain
would
beat
upon
the
window
-
glass
,
how
the
moon
would
make
ghost
on
the
wall
of
the
empty
room
,
watch
their
solitude
all
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
afresh
of
the
grave
in
the
churchyard
,
underneath
the
tree
:
and
it
seem
as
if
the
house
be
dead
too
,
now
,
and
all
connected
with
my
father
and
mother
be
fade
away
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
no
other
news
in
Peggotty
's
letter
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Barkis
be
an
excellent
husband
,
she
say
,
though
still
a
little
near
;
but
we
all
have
our
fault
,
and
she
have
plenty
(
though
I
be
sure
I
do
not
know
what
they
be
)
;
and
he
send
his
duty
,
and
my
little
bedroom
be
always
ready
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
be
well
,
and
Ham
be
well
,
and
Mrs.
 
Gummidge
be
but
poorly
,
and
little
Em'ly
would
not
send
her
love
,
but
say
that
Peggotty
may
send
it
,
if
she
like
.
   
<EOS>
all
this
intelligence
I
dutifully
impart
to
my
aunt
,
only
reserve
to
myself
the
mention
of
little
Em'ly
,
to
whom
I
instinctively
feel
that
she
would
not
very
tenderly
incline
.
 
<EOS>
while
I
be
yet
new
at
Doctor
Strong
's
,
she
make
several
excursion
over
to
Canterbury
to
see
me
,
and
always
at
unseasonable
hour
:
with
the
view
,
I
suppose
,
of
take
me
by
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
find
me
well
employ
,
and
bear
a
good
character
,
and
hear
on
all
hand
that
I
rise
fast
in
the
school
,
she
soon
discontinue
these
visit
.
<EOS>
I
see
her
on
a
Saturday
,
every
third
or
fourth
week
,
when
I
go
over
to
Dover
for
a
treat
;
and
I
see
Mr
Dick
every
alternate
Wednesday
,
when
he
arrive
by
stage
-
coach
at
noon
,
to
stay
until
next
morning
.
   
<EOS>
on
these
occasion
Mr
Dick
never
travel
without
a
leathern
writing
-
desk
,
contain
a
supply
of
stationery
and
the
Memorial
;
in
relation
to
which
document
he
have
a
notion
that
time
be
begin
to
press
now
,
and
that
it
really
must
be
get
out
of
hand
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
be
very
partial
to
gingerbread
.
 
<EOS>
to
render
his
visit
the
more
agreeable
,
my
aunt
have
instruct
me
to
open
a
credit
for
him
at
a
cake
shop
,
which
be
hamper
with
the
stipulation
that
he
should
not
be
serve
with
more
than
one
shilling's
-
worth
in
the
course
of
any
one
day
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
and
the
reference
of
all
his
little
bill
at
the
county
inn
where
he
sleep
,
to
my
aunt
,
before
they
be
pay
,
induce
me
to
suspect
that
he
be
only
allow
to
rattle
his
money
,
and
not
to
spend
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
on
further
investigation
that
this
be
so
,
or
at
least
there
be
an
agreement
between
him
and
my
aunt
that
he
should
account
to
her
for
all
his
disbursement
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
have
no
idea
of
deceive
her
,
and
always
desire
to
please
her
,
he
be
thus
make
chary
of
launch
into
expense
.
 
<EOS>
on
this
point
,
as
well
as
on
all
other
possible
point
,
Mr
Dick
be
convinced
that
my
aunt
be
the
wise
and
most
wonderful
of
woman
;
as
he
repeatedly
tell
me
with
infinite
secrecy
,
and
always
in
a
whisper
.
   
<EOS>
"
Trotwood
,
"
say
Mr
Dick
,
with
an
air
of
mystery
,
after
impart
this
confidence
to
me
,
one
Wednesday
;
"
who
be
the
man
that
hide
near
our
house
and
frighten
her
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
frighten
my
aunt
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
nod
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
nothing
would
have
frighten
her
,

he
say
,
"
for
she

<EOS>
here
he
whisper
softly
,
"
do
not
mention
it

<EOS>
the
wise
and
most
wonderful
of
woman

"
 
<EOS>
have
say
which
,
he
draw
back
,
to
observe
the
effect
which
this
description
of
her
make
upon
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
the
first
time
he
come

Mr
Dick
,
"

let
me
see

I

<EOS>
"
yes

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

how
it
can
be

Mr

,
sorely
puzzle
and
shake
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

I

as
old
as

be
it
in
that
year
that
the

"
I
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
really
"
say
Mr
Dick
,
"
I
do
not
see
how
it
can
have
be
in
that
year

Trotwood

<EOS>
do
you
get
that
date
out
of
history
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
history
never
lie
,
do
it
?
"
say
Mr
Dick
,
with
a
gleam
of
hope
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
dear
,
no
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
reply
,
most
decisively
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
ingenuous
and
young
,
and
I
think
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
make
it
out
,
"
say
Mr
Dick
,
shake
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
something
wrong
,
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
very
soon
after
the
mistake
be
make
of
put
some
of
the
trouble
out
of
King
Charles
's
head
into
my
head
,
that
the
man
first
come
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
walk
out
with
Miss
Trotwood
after
tea
,
just
at
dark
,
and
there
he
be
,
close
to
our
house

<EOS>

walk
about

I
inquire

<EOS>
"

repeat
Mr

<EOS>
"
let
me

I

a
bit

<EOS>
no
,
no

"
   
<EOS>
I
ask
,
as
the
short
way
to
get
at
it
,
what
he
be

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
he
be
not

Mr
Dick
,
"
until
he
come
up
behind
her
,
and
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
turn
round
and
faint
,
and
I
stand
still
and
look
at
him
,
and
he
walk
away
;
but
that
he
should
have
be
hide
ever
since
(
in
the
ground
or
somewhere
)
,
be
the
most
extraordinary
thing
!

<EOS>
"
have
he
be

ever

<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
he

retort
Mr

nod
his
head
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
never
come
out
,
till
last
night
!
 
<EOS>
We
be
walk
last
night
,
and
he
come
up
behind
her
again
,
and
I
know
him
again
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
and
do
he
frighten
my
aunt
again
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
all
of
a
shiver
,
"
say
Mr
Dick
,
counterfeit
that
affection
and
make
his
tooth
chatter
.
 
<EOS>
"
hold
by
the
paling
.
 
<EOS>
Cried
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
Trotwood
,
come
here
,
"
get
me
close
to
him
,
that
he
may
whisper
very
softly
;
"
why
do
she
give
him
money
,
boy
,
in
the
moonlight
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
beggar
,
perhaps
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
shake
his
head
,
as
utterly
renounce
the
suggestion
;
and
have
reply
a
great
many
time
,
and
with
great
confidence
,
"
no
beggar
,
no
beggar
,
no
beggar
,
sir
!
"
go
on
to
say
,
that
from
his
window
he
have
afterwards
,
and
late
at
night
,
see
my
aunt
give
this
person
money
outside
the
garden
rail
in
the
moonlight
,
who
then
slink
away
---
into
the
ground
again
,
as
he
think
probable
---
and
be
see
no
more
:
while
my
aunt
come
hurriedly
and
secretly
back
into
the
house
,
and
have
,
even
that
morning
,
be
quite
different
from
her
usual
self
;
which
prey
on
Mr
Dick
's
mind
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
least
belief
,
in
the
outset
of
this
story
,
that
the
unknown
be
anything
but
a
delusion
of
Mr
Dick
's
,
and
one
of
the
line
of
that
ill
-
fate
Prince
who
occasion
him
so
much
difficulty
;
but
after
some
reflection
I
begin
to
entertain
the
question
whether
an
attempt
,
or
threat
of
an
attempt
,
may
have
be
twice
make
to
take
poor
Mr
Dick
himself
from
under
my
aunt
's
protection
,
and
whether
my
aunt
,
the
strength
of
whose
kind
feeling
towards
him
I
know
from
herself
,
may
have
be
induce
to
pay
a
price
for
his
peace
and
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
be
already
much
attach
to
Mr
Dick
,
and
very
solicitous
for
his
welfare
,
my
fear
favour
this
supposition
;
and
for
a
long
time
his
Wednesday
hardly
ever
come
round
,
without
my
entertain
a
misgiving
that
he
would
not
be
on
the
coach
-
box
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
there
he
always
appear
,
however
,
grey
-
head
,
laughing
,
and
happy
;
and
he
never
have
anything
more
to
tell
of
the
man
who
could
frighten
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
these
wednesday
be
the
happy
day
of
Mr
Dick
's
life
;
they
be
far
from
be
the
least
happy
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
become
known
to
every
boy
in
the
school
;
and
though
he
never
take
an
active
part
in
any
game
but
kite
-
fly
,
be
as
deeply
interested
in
all
our
sport
as
anyone
among
us
.
 
<EOS>
how
often
have
I
see
him
,
intent
upon
a
match
at
marble
or
pegtop
,
look
on
with
a
face
of
unutterable
interest
,
and
hardly
breathe
at
the
critical
time
!
 
<EOS>
how
often
,
at
hare
and
hound
,
have
I
see
him
mount
on
a
little
knoll
,
cheer
the
whole
field
on
to
action
,
and
wave
his
hat
above
his
grey
head
,
oblivious
of
King
Charles
the
Martyr
's
head
,
and
all
belong
to
it
!
 
<EOS>
how
many
a
summer
hour
have
I
know
to
be
but
<EOS>
blissful
minute
to
him
in
the
cricket
-
field
!
 
<EOS>
how
many
winter
day
have
I
see
him
,
stand
blue
-
nosed
,
in
the
snow
and
east
wind
,
look
at
the
boy
go
down
the
long
slide
,
and
clap
his
worst
glove
in
rapture
!
   
<EOS>
He
be
an
universal
favourite
,
and
his
ingenuity
in
little
thing
be
transcendent
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
cut
orange
into
such
device
as
none
of
us
have
an
idea
of
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
make
a
boat
out
of
anything
,
from
a
skewer
upwards
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
turn
cramp
-
bone
into
chessman
;
fashion
roman
chariot
from
old
court
card
;
make
spoked
wheel
out
of
cotton
reel
,
and
bird
-
cage
of
old
wire
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
great
of
all
<EOS>
,
perhaps
,
in
the
article
of
string
and
straw
;
with
which
we
be
all
persuade
he
could
do
anything
that
could
be
do
by
hand
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
's
renown
be
not
long
confine
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
few
wednesday
,
Doctor
Strong
himself
make
some
inquiry
of
me
about
him
,
and
I
tell
him
all
my
aunt
have
tell
me
;
which
interest
the
Doctor
so
much
that
he
request
,
on
the
occasion
of
his
next
visit
,
to
be
present
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
this
ceremony
I
perform
;
and
the
Doctor
beg
Mr
Dick
,
whensoever
he
should
not
find
me
at
the
coach
office
,
to
come
on
there
,
and
rest
himself
until
our
morning
's
work
be
over
,
it
soon
pass
into
a
custom
for
Mr
Dick
to
come
on
as
a
matter
of
course
,
and
,
if
we
be
a
little
late
,
as
often
happen
on
a
Wednesday
,
to
walk
about
the
courtyard
,
wait
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
here
he
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
Doctor
's
beautiful
young
wife
(
paler
than
formerly
,
all
this
time
;
more
rarely
see
by
me
or
anyone
,
I
think
;
and
not
so
gay
,
but
not
less
beautiful
)
,
and
so
become
more
and
more
familiar
by
degree
,
until
,
at
last
,
he
would
come
into
the
school
and
wait
.
 
<EOS>
He
always
sit
in
a
particular
corner
,
on
a
particular
stool
,
which
be
call
"
Dick
"
,
after
him
;
here
he
would
sit
,
with
his
grey
head
bend
forward
,
attentively
listen
to
whatever
may
be
go
on
,
with
a
profound
veneration
for
the
learning
he
have
never
be
able
to
acquire
.
   
<EOS>
this
veneration
Mr
Dick
extend
to
the
Doctor
,
whom
he
think
the
most
subtle
and
accomplished
philosopher
of
any
age
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
long
before
Mr
Dick
ever
speak
to
him
otherwise
than
bareheade
;
and
even
when
he
and
the
Doctor
have
strike
up
quite
a
friendship
,
and
would
walk
together
by
the
hour
,
on
that
side
of
the
courtyard
which
be
know
among
us
as
the
Doctor
's
Walk
,
Mr
Dick
would
pull
off
his
hat
at
interval
to
show
his
respect
for
wisdom
and
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
how
it
ever
come
about
that
the
Doctor
begin
to
read
out
scrap
of
the
famous
Dictionary
,
in
these
walk
,
I
never
know
;
perhaps
he
feel
it
<EOS>
all
the
same
,
at
first
,
as
read
to
himself
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
pass
into
a
custom
too
;
and
Mr
Dick
,
listen
with
a
face
shine
with
pride
and
pleasure
,
in
his
heart
of
heart
believe
the
Dictionary
to
be
the
most
delightful
book
in
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
as
I
think
of
them
go
up
and
down
before
those
schoolroom
window
---
the
Doctor
read
with
his
complacent
smile
,
an
occasional
flourish
of
the
manuscript
,
or
grave
motion
of
his
head
;
and
Mr
Dick
listening
,
enchain
by
interest
,
with
his
poor
wit
calmly
wander
<EOS>
God
know
where
,
upon
the
wing
of
hard
word
---
I
think
of
it
as
one
of
the
pleasantest
thing
,
in
a
quiet
way
,
that
I
have
ever
see
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
they
may
go
walk
to
and
fro
for
ever
,
and
the
world
may
somehow
be
the
well
for
it
---
as
if
a
thousand
thing
it
make
a
noise
about
,
be
not
one
half
so
good
for
it
,
or
me
.
   
<EOS>
Agnes
be
one
of
Mr
Dick
's
friend
,
very
soon
;
and
in
often
come
to
the
house
,
he
make
acquaintance
with
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
the
friendship
between
himself
and
me
increase
continually
,
and
it
be
maintain
on
this
odd
footing
:
<EOS>
that
,
while
Mr
Dick
come
professedly
to
look
after
me
as
my
guardian
,
he
always
consult
me
in
any
little
matter
of
doubt
that
arise
,
and
invariably
guide
himself
by
my
advice
;
not
only
have
a
high
respect
for
my
native
sagacity
,
but
consider
that
I
inherit
a
good
deal
from
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
one
Thursday
morning
,
when
I
be
about
to
walk
with
Mr
Dick
from
the
hotel
to
the
coach
office
before
go
back
to
school
(
for
we
have
an
hour
's
school
before
breakfast
)
,
I
meet
Uriah
in
the
street
,
who
remind
me
of
the
promise
I
have
make
to
take
tea
with
himself
and
his
mother
:
add
,
with
a
writhe
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
expect
you
to
keep
it
,
Master
Copperfield
,
we
be
so
very
umble
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
really
have
not
yet
be
able
to
make
up
my
mind
whether
I
like
Uriah
or
detest
him
;
and
I
be
very
doubtful
about
it
still
,
as
I
stand
look
him
in
the
face
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
feel
it
quite
an
affront
to
be
suppose
proud
,
and
say
I
only
want
to
be
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
if
that
be
all
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
say
Uriah
,
"
and
it
really
be
not
our
umbleness
that
prevent
you
<EOS>
,
will
you
come
this
evening
?
 
<EOS>
but
if
it
be
our
umbleness
,
I
hope
you
will
not
mind
own
to
it
,
Master
Copperfield
;
for
we
be
well
aware
of
our
condition
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
say
I
would
mention
it
to
Mr
Wickfield
,
and
if
he
approve
,
as
I
have
no
doubt
he
would
,
I
would
come
with
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
at
six
o'clock
that
evening
,
which
be
one
of
the
early
office
evening
,
I
announce
myself
as
ready
,
to
Uriah
.
   
<EOS>
"
mother
will
be
proud
,
indeed
,
"
he
say
,
as
we
walk

I

"
   
<EOS>
"
have

to
change
the

with
an
air

denial

my
reading

hardly

<EOS>
I
have
pass
an
hour

two

sometimes

I
do
not

"
   
<EOS>
after
beat
a
little
tune
on
his
chin
as
he
walk
on
,
with
the
two
forefinger
of
his
skeleton
right
hand
,
he
add
:
   
"
there
be
expression
,

see
,
Master
Copperfield

latin

<EOS>
"
Would
you
like
to
be
teach
Latin

I

briskly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
teach
it

<EOS>
"
oh

he
answer
,
shake
his
head

<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
it
be
very
kind

make
the

be
much

I
never
see
his

so
wide

the
crease
in

so
deep

deliver
himself

writhe
modestly

I

here

my

Master

"
   
<EOS>
We
enter
a
low
,
old
-
fashioned
room
,
walk
straight
into
from
the
street
,
and
find
there
<EOS>
Mrs
Heep
,
who
be
the
dead
image
of
Uriah
,
only
short
.
 
<EOS>
She
receive
me
with
the
utmost
humility
,
and
apologize
to
me
for
give
her
son
a
kiss
,
observe
that
,
lowly
as
they
be
,
they
have
their
natural
affection
,
which
they
hope
would
give
no
offence
to
anyone
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
perfectly
decent
room
,
half
parlour
and
half
kitchen
,
but
not
at
all
a
snug
room
.
 
<EOS>
the
tea
-
thing
be
set
upon
the
table
,
and
the
kettle
be
boil
on
the
hob
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
chest
of
drawer
with
an
escritoire
top
,
for
Uriah
to
read
or
write
at
of
an
evening
;
there
be
Uriah
's
blue
bag
lie
down
and
vomit
paper
;
there
be
a
company
of
Uriah
's
book
command
by
Mr
Tidd
;
there
be
a
corner
cupboard
:
and
there
be
the
usual
article
of
furniture
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
that
any
individual
object
have
a
bare
,
pinched
,
spare
look
;
but
I
do
remember
that
the
whole
place
have
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
perhaps
a
part
of
Mrs
Heep
's
humility
,
that
she
still
wear
weed
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
lapse
of
time
that
have
occur
since
Mr
Heep
's
decease
,
she
still
wear
weed
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
there
be
some
compromise
in
the
cap
;
but
otherwise
she
be
as
weedy
as
in
the
early
day
of
her
mourning
.
   
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
day
to
be
remember
,
my
Uriah
,
I
be
sure
,
"
say
Mrs

,
make
the
tea
,
"
when
Master
Copperfield
pay
us
a
visit
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
you
would
think
so
,
mother
,
"
say
Uriah
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
I
could
have
wish
father
to
remain
among
us
for
any
reason
,
"
say
Mrs
Heep
,
"
it
would
have
be
,
that
he
may
have
know
his
company
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
feel
embarrassed
by
these
compliment
;
but
I
be
sensible
,
too
,
of
be
entertain
as
an
honoured
guest
,
and
I
think
Mrs
heep
an
agreeable
woman
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
Uriah
,
"
say
Mrs
Heep
,
"
have
look
forward
to
this
,
sir
,
a
long
while
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
his
fear
that
our
umbleness
stand
in
the
way
,
and
I
join
in
them
myself
.
 
<EOS>
umble
we
be
,
<EOS>
umble
we
have
be
,
umble
we
shall
ever
be

"
say
Mrs
Heep
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
you
have
no
occasion
to
be
so
<EOS>
,
madam
,
"
I
say
,
"
unless
you
like
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
sir
,
"
retort
Mrs
Heep
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
know
our
station
and
be
thankful
in
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
find
that
Mrs
Heep
gradually
get
near
to
me
,
and
that
Uriah
gradually
get
opposite
to
me
,
and
that
they
respectfully
ply
me
with
the
choicest
of
the
eatable
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
particularly
choice
there
,
to
be
sure
;
but
I
take
the
will
for
the
deed
,
and
feel
that
they
be
very
attentive
.
 
<EOS>
presently
they
begin
to
talk
about
aunt
,
and
then
I
tell
them
about
mine
;
and
about
father
and
mother
,
and
then
I
tell
them
about
mine
;
and
then
Mrs
Heep
begin
to
talk
about
father
-
in
-
law
,
and
then
I
begin
to
tell
her
about
mine
---
but
stop
,
because
my
aunt
have
advise
me
to
observe
a
silence
on
that
subject
.
 
<EOS>
a
tender
young
cork
,
however
,
would
have
have
no
more
chance
against
a
pair
of
corkscrews
,
or
a
tender
young
tooth
against
a
pair
of
dentist
,
or
a
little
shuttlecock
against
two
battledore
,
than
I
have
against
Uriah
and
Mrs
Heep
.
 
<EOS>
They
do
just
what
they
like
with
me
;
and
worm
thing
out
of
me
that
I
have
no
desire
to
tell
,
with
a
certainty
I
blush
to
think
of
.
 
<EOS>
the
more
especially
,
as
in
my
juvenile
frankness
,
I
take
some
credit
to
myself
for
be
so
confidential
and
feel
that
I
be
quite
the
patron
of
my
two
respectful
entertainer
.
   
<EOS>
They
be
very
fond
of
one
another
:
that
be
certain
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
it
,
that
have
its
effect
upon
me
,
as
a
touch
of
nature
;
but
the
skill
with
which
the
one
follow
up
whatever
the
other
say
,
be
a
touch
of
art
which
I
be
still
less
proof
against
.
 
<EOS>
when
there
be
nothing
more
to
be
get
out
of
me
about
myself
(
for
on
the
Murdstone
and
Grinby
life
,
and
on
my
journey
,
I
be
dumb
)
,
they
begin
about
Mr
Wickfield
and
Agnes
.
 
<EOS>
Uriah
throw
the
ball
to
Mrs
Heep
<EOS>
,
Mrs
Heep
catch
it
and
throw
it
back
to
Uriah
,
Uriah
keep
it
up
a
little
while
,
then
send
it
back
to
Mrs
Heep
,
and
so
they
go
on
toss
it
about
until
I
have
no
idea
who
have
get
it
,
and
be
quite
bewilder
.
 
<EOS>
the
ball
itself
be
always
change
too
.
 
<EOS>
now
it
be
Mr
Wickfield
,
now
agne
,
now
the
excellence
of
Mr
Wickfield
,
now
my
admiration
of
Agnes
;
now
the
extent
of
Mr
Wickfield
's
business
and
resource
,
now
our
domestic
life
after
dinner
;
now
,
the
wine
that
Mr
Wickfield
take
,
the
reason
why
he
take
it
,
and
the
pity
that
it
be
he
take
so
much
;
now
one
thing
,
now
another
,
<EOS>
then
everything
at
once
;
and
all
the
time
,
without
appear
to
speak
very
often
,
or
to
do
anything
but
sometimes
encourage
them
a
little
,
for
fear
they
should
be
overcome
by
their
humility
and
the
honour
of
my
company
,
I
find
myself
perpetually
let
out
something
or
other
that
I
have
no
business
to
let
out
and
see
the
effect
of
it
in
the
twinkling
of
Uriah
's
dinte
nostril
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
begin
to
be
a
little
uncomfortable
,
and
to
wish
myself
well
out
of
the
visit
,
when
a
figure
come
down
the
street
pass
the
door
---
it
stand
open
to
air
the
room
,
which
be
warm
,
the
weather
be
close
for
the
time
of
year

come
back
again
,
look
in
,
and
walk
in
,
exclaim
loudly
,
"
Copperfield

<EOS>
be
it
possible
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
Mr
Micawber

<EOS>
It
be
Mr
Micawber
,
with
his
eye

glass
,
and
his
walking

stick
,
and
his

collar
,
and
his
genteel

the
condescending
roll
in
his

all
complete

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My

Mr

,
put
out
his

,
"
this
be
indeed
a
meeting

be
calculate
to
impress
the

with
a
sense

the
instability
and
uncertainty
of
all
human
---
in
short
,
it
be
a
most
extraordinary
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
walk
along
the
street
,
reflect
upon
the
probability
of
something
turn
up
(
of
which
I
be
at
present
rather
sanguine

I
find
a
young

turn
up

connect

my

<EOS>
I
can
not

<EOS>
I
really
can
not

that
I
be
glad
to
see
Mr

there
;
but
I
be
glad
to
see
him
too

shake
hand
with
him
,
heartily
,
inquire
how
Mrs
Micawber
be

<EOS>
"
thank
you

"
say
Mr
Micawber
,
wave
his
hand
as
of
old

and
settle
his
chin
in
his
shirt

collar
.
 
<EOS>
"
She

Mr

in
one
of
his
burst
of
confidence

be
wean

should
be
delighted

"
You

Mr

Mr

then
smile

settle

again
,

look
about
him

<EOS>
"
I
have
discover
my

Mr

genteelly
,

without
address
himself

Mr

in
another

<EOS>
I
shall
esteem
it
an
honour

<EOS>
I
could
do
no
less
,
under
these
circumstance
,
than
make
Mr
Micawber
know
to
Uriah
Heep

his
mother

I
accordingly
do

<EOS>
as
they
abase
themselves
before
him

Mr

take
a
seat

wave
his

It

partition
off
from

commercial
room
,
and
strongly
flavour
with
tobacco
-
smoke
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
over
the
kitchen

because
a
warm
greasy
smell
appear
to
come
up
through
the
chink
in
the
floor

there
be
a
flabby
perspiration
on

I

it

near

I

the

<EOS>
They
would
rather

He
would
only
show
the
deficiency

,
"
say
Mrs

,
"
I
will
not

from
you

that
when

become
aware

cool

there
be
no

<EOS>
in
fact

that
branch

become
quite
personal
to
Mr

,
before
we
have
be
there
a
week
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
say
,
and
think
,
that
they
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
themselves
.
   
<EOS>
"
still
,
so
it
be
,
"
continue
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
"
under
such
circumstance
,
what
could
a
man
of
Mr

spirit
do
?
 
<EOS>
but
one
obvious
course
be
leave
.
 
<EOS>
to
borrow
,
of
that
branch

the
money
to
return
to
London
,

to
return
at
any
sacrifice

"
   
<EOS>
"
then
you
all
come

I

.
   
<EOS>
"
We
all
come
back
again
,
"
reply
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
"
since
then
,
I
have
consult
other
branch
of
my
family
on
the
course
which
it
be
most
expedient
for
Mr
Micawber
to
take
---
for
I
maintain
that
he
must
take
some
course
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
say
Mrs
Micawber
,
argumentatively
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
clear
that
a
family
of
six
,
not
include
a
domestic
,
can
not
live
upon
air
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
madam
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
the
opinion
of
those
other
branch
of
my
family
,
"
pursue
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
be
,
that
Mr
Micawber
should
immediately
turn
his
attention
to
coal
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
to
what
,
madam
?
"
   
"
to
coal
,
"
say
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
"
to
the
coal
trade
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
be
induce
to
think
,
on
inquiry
,
that
there
may
be
an
opening
for
a
man
of
his
talent
in
the
Medway
Coal
Trade
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
as
Mr
Micawber
very
properly
say
,
the
first
step
to
be
take
clearly
be
,
to
come
and
see
the
Medway
.
 
<EOS>
which
we
come
and
see
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
"
we
"
,
Master
Copperfield
;
for
I
never
will
,
"
say
Mrs
Micawber
with
emotion
,
"
I
never
will
desert
Mr
Micawber
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
murmur
my
admiration
and
approbation
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
come
,
"
repeat
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
and
see
the
Medway
.
 
<EOS>
My
opinion
of
the
coal
trade
on
that
river
be
,
that
it
may
require
talent
,
but
that
it
certainly
require
capital
.
 
<EOS>
talent
,
Mr
Micawber
have
;
capital
,
Mr
Micawber
have
not
.
 
<EOS>
We
see
,
I
think
,
the
great
part
of
the
Medway
;
and
that
be
my
individual
conclusion
.
 
<EOS>
be
so
near
here
,
Mr
Micawber
be
of
opinion
that
it
would
be
rash
not
to
come
on
,
and
see
the
Cathedral
.
 
<EOS>
firstly
,
on
account
of
its
be
so
well
worth
see
,
and
our
never
have
see
it
;
and
secondly
,
on
account
of
the
great
probability
of
something
turn
up
in
a
cathedral
town
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
be
here
,
"
say
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
three
day
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
have
,
as
yet
,
turn
up
;
and
it
may
not
surprise
you
,
my
dear
Master
Copperfield
,
so
much
as
it
would
a
stranger
,
to
know
that
we
be
at
present
wait
for
a
remittance
from
London
,
to
discharge
our
pecuniary
obligation
at
this
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
until
the
arrival
of
that
remittance
,
"
say
Mrs
Micawber
with
much
feeling
,
"
I
be
cut
off
from
my
home
<EOS>
(
I
allude
to
lodging
in
Pentonville
)
,
from
my
boy
and
girl
,
and
from
my
twin
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
feel
the
utmost
sympathy
for
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
in
this
anxious
extremity
,
and
say
as
much
to
Mr
Micawber
,
who
now
return
:
add
that
I
only
wish
I
have
money
enough
,
to
lend
them
the
amount
they
need
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
's
answer
express
the
disturbance
of
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
shake
hand
with
me
,
"
Copperfield
,
you
be
a
true
friend
;
but
when
the
bad
come
to
the
bad
,
no
man
be
without
a
friend
who
be
possess
of
shaving
material
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
this
dreadful
hint
Mrs
Micawber
throw
her
arm
round
Mr
Micawber
's
neck
and
entreat
him
to
be
calm
.
 
<EOS>
He
weep
;
but
so
far
recovered
,
almost
immediately
,
as
to
ring
the
bell
for
the
waiter
,
and
bespeak
a
hot
kidney
pudding
and
a
plate
of
shrimp
for
breakfast
in
the
morning
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
take
my
leave
of
them
,
they
both
press
me
so
much
to
come
and
dine
before
they
go
away
,
that
I
could
not
refuse
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
know
I
could
not
come
next
day
,
when
I
should
have
a
good
deal
to
prepare
in
the
evening
,
Mr
Micawber
arrange
that
he
would
call
at
Doctor
Strong
's
in
the
course
of
the
morning
(
have
a
presentiment
that
the
remittance
would
arrive
by
that
post
)
,
and
propose
the
day
after
,
if
it
would
suit
me
better
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
I
be
call
out
of
school
next
forenoon
,
and
find
Mr
Micawber
in
the
parlour
;
who
have
call
to
say
that
the
dinner
would
take
place
as
propose
.
<EOS>
when
I
ask
him
if
the
remittance
have
come
,
he
press
my
hand
and
depart
.
   
<EOS>
as
I
be
look
out
of
window
that
same
evening
,
it
surprise
me
,
and
make
me
rather
uneasy
,
to
see
Mr
Micawber
and
Uriah
Heep
walk
past
,
arm
in
arm
:
<EOS>
Uriah
humbly
sensible
of
the
honour
that
be
do
him
,
and
Mr
Micawber
take
a
bland
delight
in
extend
his
patronage
to
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
still
more
surprised
,
when
I
go
to
the
little
hotel
next
day
at
the
appoint
dinner
-
hour
,
which
be
four
o'clock
,
to
find
,
from
what
Mr
Micawber
say
,
that
he
have
go
home
with
Uriah
,
and
have
drunk
brandy
-
and
-
water
at
Mrs
Heep
's
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
will
tell
you
<EOS>
what
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
"
say
Mr
Micawber
,
"
<EOS>
your
friend
heep
be
a
young
fellow
who
may
be
attorney
-
general
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
know
that
young
man
,
at
the
period
when
my
difficulty
come
to
a
crisis
,
all
I
can
say
be
,
that
I
believe
my
creditor
would
have
be
a
great
deal
better
manage
than
they
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
hardly
understand
how
this
could
have
be
,
see
that
Mr
Micawber
have
pay
them
nothing
at
all
as
it
be
;
but
I
do
not
like
to
ask
.
 
<EOS>
neither
do
I
like
to
say
,
that
I
hope
he
have
not
be
too
communicative
to
Uriah
;
or
to
inquire
if
they
have
talk
much
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
of
hurt
Mr
Micawber
's
feeling
,
or
,
at
all
event
,
Mrs
Micawber
's
,
she
be
very
sensitive
;
but
I
be
uncomfortable
about
it
,
too
,
and
often
think
about
it
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
a
beautiful
little
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
quite
an
elegant
dish
of
fish
;
the
kidney
-
end
of
a
loin
of
veal
,
roast
;
fry
sausage
-
meat
;
a
partridge
,
and
a
pudding
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
wine
,
and
there
be
strong
ale
;
and
after
dinner
Mrs
Micawber
make
us
a
bowl
of
hot
punch
with
her
own
hand
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
be
uncommonly
convivial
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
him
such
good
company
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
his
face
shine
with
the
punch
,
so
that
it
look
as
if
it
have
be
varnish
all
over
.
 
<EOS>
He
get
cheerfully
sentimental
about
the
town
,
and
propose
success
to
it
;
observe
that
Mrs
Micawber
and
himself
have
be
make
extremely
snug
and
comfortable
there
and
that
he
never
should
forget
the
agreeable
hour
they
have
pass
in
Canterbury
.
 
<EOS>
He
propose
me
afterwards
;
and
he
,
and
Mrs
Micawber
,
and
I
,
take
a
review
of
our
past
acquaintance
,
in
the
course
of
which
we
sell
the
property
all
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
propose
Mrs
Micawber
:
or
,
at
least
,
say
,
modestly
,
"
if
you
will
allow
me
,
Mrs
Micawber
,
I
shall
now
have
the
pleasure
of
drink
your
health
,
madam
.
"
 
<EOS>
on
which
Mr
Micawber
deliver
an
eulogium
on
Mrs
Micawber
's
character
,
and
say
she
have
ever
be
his
guide
,

<EOS>
as

Mrs

<EOS>
when

<EOS>
in

I
never
see
anybody
so
thoroughly
jovial
as
Mr
Micawber
be
,
down
to
the
very
last
moment
of
the
evening

when
I
take
a
hearty
farewell
of
himself
and
his

<EOS>
consequently

mirth

I
have
not

this

that
there

<EOS>
under
these

alike
humiliating

He

if

one

may

by

at

extremely

<EOS>
I
be
so
shock
by
the
content
of
this
heart
-
rend
letter
,
that
I
run
off
directly
towards
the
little
hotel
with
the
intention
of
take
it
on
my
way
to
Doctor
Strong
's
,
and
try
to
soothe
Mr
Micawber
with
a
word
of
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
half
-
way
there
,
I
meet
the
London
coach
with
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
up
behind
;
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
,
the
very
picture
of
tranquil
enjoyment
,
smile
at
Mrs
Micawber
's
conversation
,
eat
walnut
out
of
a
paper
bag
,
with
a
bottle
stick
out
of
his
breast
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
do
not
see
me
,
I
think
it
best
,
all
thing
consider
,
not
to
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
with
a
great
weight
take
off
my
mind
<EOS>
,
I
turn
into
a
by
-
street
that
be
the
near
way
to
school
,
and
feel
,
upon
the
whole
,
relieve
that
they
be
go

though
I
still
like
them
very
much
,
nevertheless

Chapter
18
.
<EOS>
a
retrospect
 
<EOS>
My
school
-
day
!
 
<EOS>
the
silent
glide
on
of
my
existence
---
the
unseen
,
unfelt
progress
of
my
life
---
from
childhood
up
to
youth
!
<EOS>
let
me
think
,
as
I
look
back
upon
that
flow
water
,
now
a
dry
channel
overgrow
with
leave
,
whether
there
be
any
mark
along
its
course
,
by
which
I
can
remember
how
it
run
.
   
<EOS>
a
moment
,
and
I
occupy
my
place
in
the
Cathedral
,
where
we
all
go
together
,
every
Sunday
morning
,
assemble
first
at
school
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
the
earthy
smell
,
the
sunless
air
,
the
sensation
of
the
world
be
shut
out
,
the
resounding
of
the
organ
through
the
black
and
white
arched
gallery
and
aisle
,
be
wing
that
take
me
back
,
and
hold
me
hover
above
those
day
,
in
a
half
-
sleeping
and
half
-
wake
dream
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
not
the
last
boy
in
the
school
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
rise
in
a
few
month
,
over
several
head
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
first
boy
seem
to
me
a
mighty
creature
,
dwell
afar
off
,
whose
giddy
height
be
unattainable
.
<EOS>
Agnes
say
"
no
,
"
but
I
say
"
yes
,
"
and
tell
her
that
she
little
think
what
store
of
knowledge
have
be
master
by
the
wonderful
Being
,
at
whose
place
she
think
I
,
even
I
,
weak
aspirant
,
may
arrive
in
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
my
private
friend
and
public
patron
,
as
Steerforth
be
,
but
I
hold
him
in
a
reverential
respect
.
 
<EOS>
I
chiefly
wonder
what
he
will
be
,
when
he
leave
Doctor
Strong
's
,
and
what
mankind
will
do
to
maintain
any
place
against
him
.
   
<EOS>
but
who
be
this
that
break
upon
me
?
 
<EOS>
this
be
Miss
Shepherd
,
whom
I
love
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Shepherd
be
a
boarder
at
the
Misses
Nettingalls
'
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
I
adore
Miss
Shepherd
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
little
girl
,
in
a
spencer
,
with
a
round
face
and
curly
flaxen
hair
.
 
<EOS>
the
Misses
Nettingalls
'
young
lady
come
to
the
Cathedral
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
look
upon
my
book
,
<EOS>
for
I
must
look
upon
Miss
Shepherd
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
chorister
chaunt
,
I
hear
Miss
Shepherd
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
service
I
mentally
insert
Miss
Shepherd
's
name
---
I
put
her
in
among
the
Royal
Family
.
<EOS>
at
home
,
in
my
own
room
,
I
be
sometimes
move
to
cry
out
,
"
oh
,
Miss
Shepherd
!
"
<EOS>
in
a
transport
of
love
.
   
<EOS>
for
some
time
,
I
be
doubtful
of
Miss
Shepherd
's
feeling
,
but
,
at
length
,
fate
be
propitious
,
we
meet
at
the
dancing
-
school
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
Miss
Shepherd
for
my
partner
.
 
<EOS>
I
touch
Miss
Shepherd
's
glove
,
and
feel
a
thrill
go
up
the
right
arm
of
my
jacket
,
and
come
out
at
my
hair
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
to
Miss
Shepherd
,
but
we
understand
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Shepherd
and
myself
live
but
to
be
unite
.
   
<EOS>
why
do
I
secretly
give
Miss
Shepherd
twelve
Brazil
nut
for
a
present
,
I
wonder
?
 
<EOS>
They
be
not
expressive
of
affection
,
they
be
difficult
to
pack
into
a
parcel
of
any
regular
shape
,
they
be
hard
to
crack
,
even
in
room
door
,
and
they
be
oily
when
crack
;
yet
I
feel
that
they
be
appropriate
to
Miss
Shepherd
.
 
<EOS>
soft
,
seedy
biscuit
,
also
,
I
bestow
upon
Miss
Shepherd
;
and
orange
innumerable
.
 
<EOS>
once
,
I
kiss
Miss
Shepherd
in
the
cloak
-
room
.
<EOS>
ecstasy
!
 
<EOS>
what
be
my
agony
and
indignation
next
day
,
when
I
hear
a
flying
rumour
that
the
Misses
Nettingall
have
stand
Miss
Shepherd
in
the
stock
for
turn
in
her
toe
!
   
<EOS>
Miss
Shepherd
be
the
one
pervade
theme
and
vision
of
my
life
,
how
do
I
ever
come
to
break
with
her
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
conceive
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
a
coolness
grow
between
Miss
Shepherd
and
myself
.
 
<EOS>
whisper
reach
me
of
Miss
Shepherd
have
say
she
wish
I
would
not
stare
so
,
and
have
avow
a
preference
for
Master
Jones
---
for
Jones
!
<EOS>
a
boy
of
no
merit
whatever
!
 
<EOS>
the
gulf
between
me
and
Miss
Shepherd
widen
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
one
day
,
I
meet
the
Misses
Nettingalls
'
establishment
out
walk
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Shepherd
make
a
face
as
she
go
by
,
and
laugh
to
her
companion
.
 
<EOS>
all
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
the
devotion
of
a
life
---
it
seem
a
life
<EOS>
,
it
be
all
the
same
---
be
at
an
end
;
Miss
Shepherd
come
out
of
the
morning
service
,
and
the
Royal
Family
know
her
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
high
in
the
school
,
and
no
one
break
my
peace
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
at
all
polite
,
now
,
to
the
Misses
Nettingalls
'
young
lady
,
and
should
not
dote
on
any
of
them
,
if
they
be
twice
as
many
and
twenty
time
as
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
the
dancing
-
school
a
tiresome
affair
,
and
wonder
why
the
girl
can
not
dance
by
themselves
and
leave
us
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
grow
great
in
latin
verse
,
and
neglect
the
lace
of
my
boot
.
 
<EOS>
Doctor
Strong
refer
to
me
in
public
as
a
promising
young
scholar
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
be
wild
with
joy
,
and
my
aunt
remit
me
a
guinea
by
the
next
post
.
   
<EOS>
the
shade
of
a
young
butcher
rise
,
like
the
apparition
of
an
armed
head
in
Macbeth
.
 
<EOS>
who
be
this
young
butcher
?
 
<EOS>
He
be
the
terror
of
the
youth
of
Canterbury
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
vague
belief
abroad
,
that
the
beef
suet
with
which
he
anoint
his
hair
give
him
unnatural
strength
,
and
that
he
be
a
match
for
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
broad
-
faced
,
bull
-
necked
,
young
butcher
,
with
rough
red
cheek
,
an
ill
-
condition
mind
,
and
an
injurious
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
His
main
use
of
this
tongue
,
be
,
to
disparage
Doctor
Strong
's
young
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
publicly
,
that
if
they
want
anything
he
will
give
it
'em
.
 
<EOS>
He
name
individual
among
them
(
myself
include
)
,
whom
he
could
undertake
to
settle
with
one
hand
,
and
the
other
tie
behind
him
.
<EOS>
He
waylay
the
small
boy
to
punch
their
unprotected
head
,
and
call
challenge
after
me
in
the
open
street
.
 
<EOS>
for
these
sufficient
reason
I
resolve
to
fight
the
butcher
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
summer
evening
,
down
in
a
green
hollow
,
at
the
corner
of
a
wall
.
 
<EOS>
I
meet
the
butcher
by
appointment
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
attend
by
a
select
body
of
our
boy
;
the
butcher
,
by
two
other
butcher
,
a
young
publican
,
and
a
sweep
.
 
<EOS>
the
preliminary
be
adjust
,
and
the
butcher
and
myself
stand
face
to
face
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
moment
the
butcher
light
ten
thousand
candle
out
of
my
left
eyebrow
.
 
<EOS>
in
another
moment
,
I
do
not
know
where
the
wall
be
,
or
where
I
be
,
or
where
anybody
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
which
be
myself
and
which
the
butcher
,
we
be
always
in
such
a
tangle
and
tussle
,
knock
about
upon
the
trodden
grass
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
I
see
the
butcher
,
bloody
but
confident
;
sometimes
I
see
nothing
,
and
sit
gasping
on
my
second
's
knee
;
sometimes
I
go
in
at
the
butcher
madly
,
and
cut
my
knuckle
open
against
his
face
,
without
appear
to
discompose
him
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
I
awake
,
very
queer
about
the
head
,
as
from
a
giddy
sleep
,
and
see
the
butcher
walk
off
,
congratulate
by
the
two
other
butcher
and
the
sweep
and
publican
,
and
put
on
his
coat
as
he
go
;
from
which
I
augur
,
justly
,
that
the
victory
be
his
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
take
home
in
a
sad
plight
,
and
I
have
beef
-
steak
put
to
my
eye
,
and
be
rub
with
vinegar
and
brandy
,
and
find
a
great
puffy
place
burst
out
on
my
upper
lip
,
which
swell
immoderately
.
 
<EOS>
for
three
or
four
day
I
remain
at
home
,
a
very
ill
-
look
subject
,
with
a
green
shade
over
my
eye
;
and
I
should
be
very
dull
,
but
that
Agnes
be
a
sister
to
me
,
and
condole
with
me
,
and
read
to
me
,
and
make
the
time
light
and
happy
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
have
my
confidence
completely
,
always
;
I
tell
her
all
about
the
butcher
,
and
the
wrong
he
have
heap
upon
me
;
she
think
I
could
not
have
do
otherwise
than
fight
the
butcher
,
while
she
shrink
and
tremble
at
my
have
fight
him
.
   
<EOS>
Time
have
steal
on
unobserved
,
for
Adams
be
not
the
head
-
boy
in
the
day
that
be
come
now
,
nor
have
he
be
this
many
and
many
a
day
.
<EOS>
Adams
have
leave
the
school
so
long
,
that
when
he
come
back
,
on
a
visit
to
Doctor
Strong
,
there
be
not
many
there
,
besides
myself
,
who
know
him
.
 
<EOS>
Adams
be
go
to
be
call
to
the
bar
almost
directly
,
and
be
to
be
an
advocate
,
and
to
wear
a
wig
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
to
find
him
a
meeker
man
than
I
have
think
,
and
less
impose
in
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
stagger
the
world
yet
,
either
;
for
it
go
on
(
as
well
as
I
can
make
out
)
pretty
much
the
same
as
if
he
have
never
join
it
.
   
<EOS>
a
blank
,
through
which
the
warrior
of
poetry
and
history
march
on
in
stately
host
that
seem
to
have
no
end
---
and
what
come
next
!
<EOS>
I
be
the
head
-
boy
,
now
!
 
<EOS>
I
look
down
on
the
line
of
boy
below
me
,
with
a
condescending
interest
in
such
of
them
as
bring
to
my
mind
<EOS>
the
boy
<EOS>
I
be
myself
,
when
I
first
come
there
.
 
<EOS>
that
little
fellow
seem
to
be
no
part
of
me
;
I
remember
him
as
something
leave
behind
upon
the
road
of
life
---
as
something
I
have
pass
,
rather
than
have
actually
be
---
and
almost
think
of
him
as
of
someone
else
.
   
<EOS>
and
the
little
girl
I
see
on
that
first
day
at
Mr
Wickfield
's
,
where
be
she
?
 
<EOS>
go

My

It

<EOS>
I
see

speak
to

in

<EOS>
I
see
them
cross
the

to
meet
her
,
<EOS>
when
her

(
she
have

be

come
down

She

I

if

I
be

<EOS>
I
deserve
a

<EOS>
the

I

Race
Ball

where
I

My

in
put

over

I
seem

everything

Mr

a

old
gentleman
with
a
double
chin

and
one
of
his

immovable

be
fraught
with

<EOS>
when
I

I

"
how

Mr

quite
well

seem
so
pointed
,
that
I
blush
.
   
<EOS>
I
think
continually
about
my
age

<EOS>
Say
I
be
seventeen
,
and
say
that
seventeen
be
young
for
the
eld
Miss
Larkins
,
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
besides
,
I
shall
be
one
-
and
-
twenty
in
no

almost
.
 
<EOS>
I
regularly
take
walk
outside
Mr
Larkins
's
house
in
the
evening
,
though
it
cut
me
to
the
heart
to
see
the
officer
go
in
,
or
to
hear
them
up
in
the
drawing

room
,
where
the
eld
Miss
Larkins
play
the
harp
.
<EOS>
I
even
walk

on
two

three
occasion

in
a
sickly

spoony
manner

round

round
the
house
after
the
family
be
go
to
bed
,
wonder
which
be
the
eld
Miss
Larkins
's
chamber
(
and
pitching
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
now
,
on
Mr

instead
)
;
wish
that
a
fire
would
burst
out
;
that
the
assemble
crowd
would
stand
appal
;
that
I
,
dash
through
them
with
a
ladder

may
rear
it
against
her
window
,
save
her
in
my
arm
,
go
back
for
something
she
have
leave
behind
,
and
perish
in
the
flame
.
 
<EOS>
for
I
be
generally
disintereste
in
my
love
,
and
think
I
could
be
content
to
make
a
figure
before
Miss
Larkins
,
and
expire
.
   
<EOS>
generally
,
but
not
always

<EOS>
sometimes
bright

<EOS>
when
I
dress
(
the

hour

,
for
a
great
ball
give
at
the
Larkins

(
the

of
three
week

I
indulge
my
fancy
with
pleasing
image

<EOS>
I
picture
myself
take
courage
to
make
a
declaration
to
Miss
Larkins

<EOS>
I
picture
Miss

Strong
be
present
at
the

all
this
go

<EOS>
I
repair
to

where
there
be
light

chattering

officer
<EOS>
(
I

She

<EOS>
It
be
the
first
really
grow

up
party
that
I
have
ever
be
invite
to
,
and
I
be
a
little
uncomfortable
;
for
I
appear
not
to
belong
to
anybody
,
and
nobody
appear
to
have
anything
to
say
to
me
,
except
Mr
Larkins
,
who
ask
me
how
my
schoolfellow
be

which
he
nee
not
do

as
I
have
not

ask
me
pleasantly

Miss

blush
)
,

"

I
do
waltz
(
pretty
well

too

as
it
happen

,
and
I
take
Miss

out
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
her
sternly
from

<EOS>
He

I

I
have
be
wretched

too

<EOS>
I
waltz
with
the

<EOS>
I
do
not
know
where

among
whom

or
how
long

<EOS>
I
only
know
that
I
swim
about
in
space

with
a
blue
angel
,
in
a
state
of
blissful
delirium
,
until
I
find
myself
alone

rest
on

She

<EOS>
She
give
it
me
,
not

and
I
put
it
to
my

,
and
then
into
my
breast
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Larkins
,
laughing
,
draw
her
hand
through
my
arm
,
and
say
,
"
now
take
me
back
to
Captain
Bailey

"
   
<EOS>
I
be
lose
in
the
recollection
of
this
delicious
interview
,
and
the
waltz
,
when
she
come
to
me
again
,
with
a
plain
elderly
gentleman
who
have
be
play
whist
all
night

upon

<EOS>
Mr

I
feel
at
once
that
he
be
a
friend
of

be
much
gratified

"
I

Mr

It
do
you
credit

<EOS>
I
suppose
you
do
not
take
much
interest
in
hop

I
be
a
pretty
large
grower
myself
;
and
if
you
ever
like
to
come
over

<EOS>
I
thank
Mr

warmly

shake

<EOS>
I
think
I
be
in
a
happy
dream

<EOS>
I
waltz
with
the

once
again

<EOS>
She
say
I
waltz
so
well

I
go
home
in

unspeakable
bliss

waltz
in
imagination

all
night
long

with
my

I
neither

I
be
imperfectly
console

<EOS>
I
be
terribly
dejected
for
about
a
week
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
off
my
ring
<EOS>
,
I
wear
my
bad
clothe
,
I
use
no
bear
's
grease
,
and
I
frequently
lament
over
the
late
Miss
Larkins
's
fade
flower
.
<EOS>
be
,
by
that
time
,
rather
tired
of
this
kind
of
life
,
and
have
receive
new
provocation
from
the
butcher
,
I
throw
the
flower
away
,
go
out
with
the
butcher
,
and
gloriously
defeat
him
.
   
<EOS>
this
,
and
the
resumption
of
my
ring

as
well
as
of
the
bear

grease
in
moderation

the
last
mark
I
can
discern

now

in

progress

Chapter
19
.
<EOS>
I
look
about
me
,
and
make
a
discovery
 
I
be
doubtful
whether
I
be
at
heart
glad
or
sorry
,
when
my
school
-
day
draw
to
an
end
,
and
the
time
come
for
my
leaving
Doctor
Strong
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
very
happy
there
,
I
have
a
great
attachment
for
the
Doctor
,
and
I
be
eminent
and
distinguish
in
that
little
world
.
 
<EOS>
for
these
reason
I
be
sorry
to
go
;
but
for
other
reason
,
unsubstantial
enough
,
I
be
glad
.
 
<EOS>
misty
idea
of
be
a
young
man
at
my
own
disposal
,
of
the
importance
attach
to
a
young
man
at
his
own
disposal
,
of
the
wonderful
thing
to
be
see
and
do
by
that
magnificent
animal
,
and
the
wonderful
effect
he
could
not
fail
to
make
upon
society
,
lure
me
away
.
 
<EOS>
so
powerful
be
these
visionary
consideration
in
my
boyish
mind
,
that
I
seem
,
accord
to
my
present
way
of
thinking
,
to
have
leave
school
without
natural
regret
.
 
<EOS>
the
separation
have
not
make
the
impression
on
me
,
that
other
separation
have
.
 
<EOS>
I
try
in
vain
to
recall
how
I
feel
about
it
,
and
what
its
circumstance
be
;
but
it
be
not
momentous
in
my
recollection
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
opening
prospect
confuse
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
my
juvenile
experience
go
for
little
or
nothing
then
;
and
that
life
be
more
like
a
great
fairy
story
,
which
I
be
just
about
to
begin
to
read
,
than
anything
else
.
   
<EOS>
my
aunt
<EOS>
and
I
have
hold
many
grave
deliberation
on
the
calling
to
which
I
should
be
devote
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
year
or
more
I
have
endeavour
to
find
a
satisfactory
answer
to
her
often
-
repeat
question
,
"
what
I
would
like
to
be
?
"
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
no
particular
liking
,
that
I
could
discover
,
for
anything
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
could
have
be
inspire
with
a
knowledge
of
the
science
of
navigation
,
take
the
command
of
a
fast
-
sailing
expedition
,
and
go
round
the
world
on
a
triumphant
voyage
of
discovery
,
I
think
I
may
have
consider
myself
completely
suit
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
in
the
absence
of
any
such
miraculous
provision
,
my
desire
be
to
apply
myself
to
some
pursuit
that
would
not
lie
too
heavily
upon
her
purse
;
and
to
do
my
duty
in
it
,
whatever
it
may
be
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
have
regularly
assist
at
our
council
,
with
a
meditative
and
sage
demeanour
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
make
a
suggestion
but
once
;
and
on
that
occasion
(
I
do
not
know
what
put
it
in
his
head
)
<EOS>
,
he
suddenly
propose
that
I
should
be
"
a
Brazier
"
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
receive
this
proposal
so
very
ungraciously
,
that
he
never
venture
on
a
second
;
but
ever
afterwards
confine
himself
to
look
watchfully
at
her
for
her
suggestion
,
and
rattle
his
money
.
   
<EOS>
"
Trot
,
I
tell
you
what
,
my
dear
,
"
say
my
aunt
,
one
morning
in
the
Christmas
season
when
I
leave
school
:
"
as
this
knotty
point
be
still
unsettle
,
and
as
we
must
not
make
a
mistake
in
our
decision
if
we
can
help
it
,
I
think
we
have
better
take
a
little
breathing
-
time
.
<EOS>
in
the
meanwhile
,
you
must
try
to
look
at
it
from
a
new
point
of
view
,
and
not
as
a
schoolboy
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
aunt

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
have
occur
to
me
,
"
pursue
my
aunt
,
"
that
a
little
change
,
and
a
glimpse
of
life
out
of
door
,
may
be
useful
in
help
you
to
know
your
own
mind
,
and
form
a
cool
judgement
.
 
<EOS>
suppose
you
be
to
go
down
into
the
old
part
of
the
country
again
,
for
instance
,
and
see
that
---
that
out
-
of
-
the

way
woman
with
the
savage
of
name

"
say
my
aunt

rub
her
nose

she
could
never
thoroughly
forgive
Peggotty
for

so
call

<EOS>
"
of
all

I

well
,

my
aunt

"
that
be
lucky

I
should
like
it
too

<EOS>

it
be
natural

rational

you

I

"
Your

have
be
as
natural

rational
a

You
will
be
worthy

I

shall
be
worthy
of
you

will
be
enough
for
me

It

a
mother
of
yours
do
not
live

my
aunt

look
at
me
approvingly

she

so
vain

this

My

it
in

<EOS>
in

fit
out

at
parting

my

give
me
some
good
advice

a
good
many

say
that
as
her
object
be
that
I
should
look
about
me

should
think
a
little
,
she
would
recommend
me
to
stay
a
few
day
in

either
on

in

the
before

three

a

<EOS>
I
go
to
Canterbury
first

My

you

have
tell

at

for
I
see
a

blush
in

you

someone

up

<EOS>
We
have
go
on
,
so
far
,
in
a
mixture
of
confidential
jest

earnest

that
have
long
grow
naturally
out

begin
as

<EOS>
but
Agnes
,
now
suddenly
lift
up
her
eye
to
mine
,

speak
in
a
different
manner

say
:
   
<EOS>
"
Trotwood

there
be
something
that
I
want
to
ask

that
I
may
not
have
another
opportunity

ask
for
a
long
time

perhaps
---
something
I
would
ask
,
I
think

of
no

else

<EOS>
have
you
observe
any
gradual
alteration
in
Papa

<EOS>
I
have
observe
it
,
and
have
often
wonder
whether
she
have
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
show
as
much
,
now
,
in
my
face
;
for
her
eye
be
in
a
moment
cast
down
,
and
I
see
tear
in
them

"
tell
me
what
it

in

low
voice

I
be

plain

him
so
much

<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
she
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
do
himself
no
good

the
habit

have
increase
upon
him

I
first
come
here

<EOS>
He
be
often
very
nervous

I
fancy
so

<EOS>
"
It
be
not
fancy

shake
her
head

"
<EOS>
His
hand
tremble
,
his
speech
be
not
plain
,
and
his
eye
look
wild
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
remark
that
at
those
time
,

when
he
be
least
like
himself

he
be
most
certain

be
want
on

<EOS>
"
by
Uriah

"

Agnes

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
;
<EOS>
and
the
sense
of
be
unfit
for
it
,
or
of
not
have
understand
it
,
or
of
have
show
his
condition
in
spite
of
himself

seem
to
make
him
so
uneasy

that
next
day
he
be
bad
,

next

worse
,

so
he
become
jade
and
haggard
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
be
alarm
by
what
I
say
,
Agnes
,
but
in
this
state
I
see
him
,
only
the
other
evening
,
lie
down
his
head
upon
his
desk
,
and
shed
tear
like
a
child
.
"
   
<EOS>
Her
hand
pass
softly
before
my
lip
while
I
be
yet
speak
,
and
in
a
moment
she
have
meet
her
father
at
the
door
of
the
room
,
and
be
hang
on
his
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
the
expression
of
her
face
,
as
they
both
look
towards
me
<EOS>
,
I
feel
to
be
very
touching
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
such
deep
fondness
for
him
,
and
gratitude
to
him
for
all
his
love
and
care
,
in
her
beautiful
look
;
and
there
be
such
a
fervent
appeal
to
me
to
deal
tenderly
by
him
,
even
in
my
inmost
thought
,
and
to
let
no
harsh
construction
find
any
place
against
him
;
she
be
,
at
once
,
so
proud
of
him
and
devoted
to
him
,
yet
so
compassionate
and
sorry
,
and
so
reliant
upon
me
to
be
so
,
too
;
that
nothing
she
could
have
say
would
have
express
more
to
me
,
or
move
me
more
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
to
drink
tea
at
the
Doctor
's

<EOS>
We
go
there
at
the
usual
hour
;
and
round
the
study
fireside
find
the
Doctor
,

his
young
wife
,
and
her
mother

<EOS>
the
Doctor

who
make
as
much
of
my
go
away
as
if
I
be
go
to
China

receive
me
as
an
honoured
guest
;
and
call
for
a
log
of
wood
to
be
throw
on
the
fire
,
that
he
may
see
the
face
of
his
old
pupil
redden
in

blaze

up

that

tell

go
several

operation

kiss
the
stick

up

all
this

his
glance
upon

appear
to
me

never

be
so
intent

upon

quite
absorb

now
ask

actually
write

he
have
write

the

reluctantly

as
I
hand
it
to
the
old
lady

see
how
the
unwilling

I
take

tremble

leave
off

again

at

placid
satisfaction

<EOS>
no

to
be
sure
,
know
that
he
never
be
really
strong

what
do
I
say
just
now
?

that
I
have
undergo
so
much
in

distant
place

have
decide

hazard

on
sick
leave

if
I
can

on
total
resignation

be
not

what
I
have
endure

insupportable

<EOS>
and
but
for
the
promptitude
of

good
of
creature

"
say
Mrs
Markleham
,
telegraph
the
Doctor
as
before
,
and
refolde
the
letter
,
"
it
would
be
insupportable
to
me
to
think
of
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Wickfield
say
not
one
word
,
though
the
old
lady
look
to
him
as
if
for
his
commentary
on
this
intelligence
;
but
sit
severely
silent
,
with
his
eye
fix
on
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
long
after
the
subject
be
dismiss
,
and
other
topic
occupy
us
,
he
remain
so
;
seldom
raise
his
eye
,
unless
to
rest
them
for
a
moment
,
with
a
thoughtful
frown
,
upon
the
Doctor
,
or
his
wife
,
or
both
.
   
<EOS>
the
Doctor
be
very
fond
of
music
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
sing
with
great
sweetness
and
expression
,
and
so
do
Mrs
Strong
.
 
<EOS>
They
sing
together
,
and
play
duet
together
,
and
we
have
quite
a
little
concert
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
remark
two
thing
:
<EOS>
first
,
that
though
Annie
soon
recover
her
composure
,
and
be
quite
herself
,
there
be
a
blank
between
her
and
Mr
Wickfield
which
separate
them
wholly
from
each
other
;
secondly
,
that
Mr
Wickfield
seem
to
dislike
the
intimacy
between
her
and
Agnes
,
and
to
watch
it
with
uneasiness
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
,
I
must
confess
,
the
recollection
of
what
I
have
see
on
that
night
when
Mr
Maldon
go
away
,
first
begin
to
return
upon
me
with
a
meaning
it
have
never
have
,
and
to
trouble
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
innocent
beauty
of
her
face
be
not
as
innocent
to
me
as
it
have
be
;
I
mistrust
the
natural
grace
and
charm
of
her
manner
;
and
when
I
look
at
agne
by
her
side
,
and
think
how
good
and
true
agne
be
,
suspicion
arise
within
me
that
it
be
an
ill
-
assorted
friendship
.
   
<EOS>
She
be
so
happy
in
it
herself
,
however
,
and
the
other
be
so
happy
too
,
that
they
make
the
evening
fly
away
as
if
it
be
but
an
hour
.
<EOS>
It
close
in
an
incident
which
I
well
remember
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
take
leave
of
each
other
,
and
Agnes
be
go
to
embrace
her
and
kiss
her
,
when
Mr
Wickfield
step
between
them
,
as
if
by
accident
,
and
draw
Agnes
quickly
away
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
see
,
as
though
all
the
intervene
time
have
be
cancel
,
and
I
be
still
stand
in
the
doorway
on
the
night
of
the
departure
,
the
expression
of
that
night
in
the
face
of
Mrs
Strong
,
as
it
confront
his
.
   
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
what
an
impression
this
make
upon
me
,
or
<EOS>
how
impossible
I
find
it
,
when
I
think
of
her
afterwards
,
to
separate
her
from
this
look
,
and
remember
her
face
in
its
innocent
loveliness
again
.
 
<EOS>
It
haunt
me
when
I
get
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
seem
to
have
leave
the
Doctor
's
roof
with
a
dark
cloud
lower
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
reverence
that
I
have
for
his
grey
head
,
be
mingle
with
commiseration
for
his
faith
in
those
who
be
treacherous
to
him
,
and
with
resentment
against
those
who
injure
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
impending
shadow
of
a
great
affliction
,
and
a
great
disgrace
that
have
no
distinct
form
in
it
yet
,
fall
like
a
stain
upon
the
quiet
place
where
I
have
work
and
play
as
a
boy
,
and
do
it
a
cruel
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
pleasure
in
thinking
,
any
more
,
of
the
grave
old
broad
-
leave
aloe
-
tree
,
which
remain
shut
up
in
themselves
a
hundred
year
together
,
and
of
the
trim
smooth
grass
-
plot
,
and
the
stone
urn
,
and
the
doctor
's
walk
,
and
the
congenial
sound
of
the
cathedral
bell
hover
above
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
the
tranquil
sanctuary
of
my
boyhood
have
be
sack
before
my
face
,
and
its
peace
and
honour
give
to
the
wind
.
   
<EOS>
but
morning
bring
with
it
my
parting
from
the
old
house
,
which
Agnes
have
fill
with
her
influence
;
and
that
occupy
my
mind
sufficiently
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
there
again
soon
,
no
doubt
;
I
may
sleep
again
---
perhaps
often
---
in
my
old
room
;
but
the
day
of
my
inhabiting
there
be
go
,
and
the
old
time
be
past
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
heavy
at
heart
when
I
pack
up
such
of
my
book
and
clothe
as
still
remain
there
to
be
send
to
Dover
,
than
I
care
to
show
to
Uriah
Heep
;
who
be
so
officious
to
help
me
,
<EOS>
that
I
uncharitably
think
him
mighty
glad
that
I
be
go
.
   
<EOS>
I
get
away
from
Agnes
and
her
father
,
somehow
,
with
an
indifferent
show
of
be
very
manly
,
and
take
my
seat
upon
the
box
of
the
London
coach
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
softened
and
forgiving
,
go
through
the
town
,
that
I
have
half
a
mind
to
nod
to
my
old
enemy
the
butcher
,
and
throw
him
five
shilling
to
drink
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
look
such
a
very
obdurate
butcher
as
he
stand
scrape
the
great
block
in
the
shop
,
and
moreover
,
his
appearance
be
so
little
improve
by
the
loss
of
a
front
tooth
which
I
have
knock
out
<EOS>
,
that
I
think
it
best
to
make
no
advance
.
   
<EOS>
the
main
object
on
my
mind
<EOS>
,
I
remember
,
when
we
get
fairly
on
the
road
,
be
to
appear
as
old
as
possible
to
the
coachman
,
and
to
speak
extremely
gruff
.
 
<EOS>
the
latter
point
I
achieve
at
great
personal
inconvenience
;
but
<EOS>
I
stick
to
it
,
because
I
feel
it
be
a
grow
-
up
sort
of
thing
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
go
through
,
sir
?
"
say
the
coachman
.
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
William
,
"
<EOS>
I
say
,
condescendingly
(
I
know
him
)
;
"
I
be
go
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
go
down
into
Suffolk
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
shooting
,
sir
?
"
say
the
coachman
.
   
<EOS>
He
know
as
well
as
I
do
that
it
be
just
as
likely
,
at
that
time
of
year
,
I
be
go
down
there
whale
;
but
I
feel
compliment
,
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
I
say
,
pretend
to
be
undecided
,
"
whether
I
shall
take
a
shot
or
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
bird
be
get
wery
shy
,
I
be
tell
,
"
say
William
.
   
<EOS>
"
so
I
understand
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
be
Suffolk
your
county
,
sir
?
"
ask
William
.
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
say
,
with
some
importance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Suffolk
's
my
county
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
tell
the
dumpling
be
uncommon
fine
down
there
,
"
say
William
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
not
aware
of
it
myself
,
but
I
feel
it
necessary
to
uphold
the
institution
of
my
county
,
and
to
evince
a
familiarity
with
them
;
so
I
shake
my
head
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
I
believe
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
the
Punches
,
"
say
William
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
cattle
!
 
<EOS>
a
Suffolk
Punch
,
when
he
be
a
good
un
,
be
worth
his
weight
in
gold
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
ever
breed
any
Suffolk
Punches
yourself
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
N
-
no
,
"
I
say
,
"
not
exactly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
here
be
a
gen'lm'n
behind
me
,
I
will
pound
it
,
"
say
William
,
"
as
have
breed
'em
by
wholesale
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
gentleman
spoken
of
be
a
gentleman
with
a
very
unpromising
squint
,
and
a
prominent
chin
,
who
have
a
tall
white
hat
on
with
a
narrow
flat
brim
,
and
whose
close
-
fitting
drab
trouser
seem
to
button
all
the
way
up
outside
his
leg
from
his
boot
to
his
hip
.
<EOS>
His
chin
be
cock
over
the
coachman
's
shoulder
,
so
near
to
me
,
that
his
breath
quite
tickle
the
back
of
my
head
;
and
as
I
look
at
him
,
he
leer
at
the
leader
with
the
eye
with
which
he
do
not
squint
,
in
a
very
knowing
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
not
you
?
"
ask
William
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
not
I
what
?
"
say
the
gentleman
behind
.
   
<EOS>
"
breed
them
Suffolk
Punches
by
wholesale

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
so
,
"
say
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
not
no
sort
of
orse
that
I
be
not

and
no

<EOS>
Orses
and
dorg
be
some
man
's
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
wittle

to
me

<EOS>
lodging

wife
,
and
child

reading
,
writing
,
and
Arithmetic

snuff
,
tobacker

and

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
not
a
sort
of
man
to
see
sit
behind
a
coach
-
box
,
be
it
though
?
"
say
William
in
my
ear
,
as
he
handle
the
rein
.
   
<EOS>
I
construe
this
remark
into
an
indication
of
a
wish
that
he
should
have
my
place
,
so
I
blushingly
offer
to
resign
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
if
you
do
not
mind
,
sir
,
"
say
William
,
"
I
think
it
would
be
more
correct
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
have
always
consider
this
as
the
first
fall
I
have
in
life
.
<EOS>
when
I
book
my
place
at
the
coach
office
<EOS>
I
have
have
"
Box
Seat
"
write
against
the
entry
,
and
have
give
the
book
-
keeper
half
-
a
-
crown
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
get
up
in
a
special
great
-
coat
and
shawl
,
expressly
to
do
honour
to
that
distinguished
eminence
;
have
glorify
myself
upon
it
a
good
deal
;
and
have
feel
that
I
be
a
credit
to
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
and
here
,
in
the
very
first
stage
,
I
be
supplant
by
a
shabby
man
with
a
squint
,
who
have
no
other
merit
than
smell
like
a
livery
-
stable
,
and
be
able
to
walk
across
me
,
more
like
a
fly
than
a
human
being
,
while
the
horse
be
at
a
canter
!
   
<EOS>
a
distrust
of
myself
,
which
have
often
beset
me
in
life
on
small
occasion
,
when
it
would
have
be
better
away
,
be
assuredly
not
stop
in
its
growth
by
this
little
incident
outside
the
Canterbury
coach
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
to
take
refuge
in
gruffness
of
speech
.
 
<EOS>
I
speak
from
the
pit
of
my
stomach
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
,
but
<EOS>
I
feel
completely
extinguish
,
and
dreadfully
young
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
curious
and
interesting
,
nevertheless
,
to
be
sit
up
there
behind
four
horse
:
well
educated
,
well
dressed
,
and
with
plenty
of
money
in
my
pocket
;
and
to
look
out
for
the
place
where
I
have
sleep
on
my
weary
journey
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
abundant
occupation
for
my
thought
,
in
every
conspicuous
landmark
on
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
look
down
at
the
tramper
whom
we
pass
,
and
see
that
well
-
remember
style
of
face
turn
up
,
I
feel
as
if
the
tinker
's
blacken
hand
be
in
the
bosom
of
my
shirt
again
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
clatter
through
the
narrow
street
of
Chatham
,
and
I
catch
a
glimpse
,
in
passing
,
of
the
lane
where
the
old
monster
live
who
have
buy
my
jacket
<EOS>
,
I
stretch
my
neck
eagerly
to
look
for
the
place
where
I
have
sit
,
in
the
sun
and
in
the
shade
,
wait
for
my
money
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
come
,
at
last
,
within
a
stage
of
London
,
and
pass
the
veritable
Salem
House
where
Mr
Creakle
have
lay
about
him
with
a
heavy
hand
,
I
would
have
give
all
I
have
,
for
lawful
permission
to
get
down
and
thrash
him
,
and
let
all
the
boy
out
like
so
many
cage
sparrow
.
   
<EOS>
We
go
to
the
Golden
Cross
at
Charing
Cross
,
then
<EOS>
a
mouldy
sort
of
establishment
in
a
close
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
a
waiter
show
me
into
the
coffee
-
room
;
and
a
chambermaid
introduce
me
to
my
small
bedchamber
,
which
smell
like
a
hackney
-
coach
,
and
be
shut
up
like
a
family
vault
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
still
painfully
conscious
of
my
youth
,
for
nobody
stand
in
any
awe
of
me
at
all
:
the
chambermaid
be
utterly
indifferent
to
my
opinion
on
any
subject
,
and
the
waiter
be
familiar
with
me
,
and
offer
advice
to
my
inexperience
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
now
,
"
say
the
waiter
,
in
a
tone
of
confidence
,
"
what
would
you
like
for
dinner
?
 
<EOS>
young
gentleman
like
poultry
in
general
:
have
a
fowl
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
as
majestically
as
I
could
,
that
I
be
not
in
the
humour
for
a
fowl
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
not
you
?
"
say
the
waiter
.
 
<EOS>
"
young
gentleman
be
generally
tired
of
beef
and
mutton
:
have
a
weal
cutlet
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
assent
to
this
proposal
,
in
default
of
be
able
to
suggest
anything
else
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
care
for
tater
?
"
say
the
waiter
,
with
an
insinuate
smile
,
and
his
head
on
one
side
.
 
<EOS>
"
young
gentleman
generally
have
be
overdose
with
tater
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
command
him
,
in
my
deep
voice
,
to
order
a
veal
cutlet
and
potato
,
and
all
thing
fit
;
and
to
inquire
at
the
bar
if
there
be
any
letter
for
Trotwood
Copperfield
,
Esquire
---
which
I
know
there
be
not
,
and
could
not
be
,
but
think
it
manly
to
appear
to
expect
.
   
<EOS>
He
soon
come
back
to
say
that
there
be
none
(
at
which
I
be
much
surprised
)
and
begin
to
lay
the
cloth
for
my
dinner
in
a
box
by
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
while
he
be
so
engaged
,
he
ask
me
what
I
would
take
with
it
;
and
on
my
reply
"
half
a
pint
of
sherry
,
"
think
it
a
favourable
opportunity
,
I
be
afraid
,
to
extract
that
measure
of
wine
from
the
stale
leaving
at
the
bottom
of
several
small
decanter
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
of
this
opinion
,
because
,
while
I
be
read
the
newspaper
,
I
observe
him
behind
a
low
wooden
partition
,
which
be
his
private
apartment
,
very
busy
pour
out
of
a
number
of
those
vessel
into
one
,
like
a
chemist
and
druggist
make
up
a
prescription
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
wine
come
,
too
,
I
think
it
flat
;
and
it
certainly
have
more
english
crumb
in
it
,
than
be
to
be
expect
in
a
foreign
wine
in
anything
like
a
pure
state
,
but
I
be
bashful
enough
to
drink
it
,
and
say
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
be
then
in
a
pleasant
frame
of
mind
(
from
which
I
infer
that
poisoning
be
not
always
disagreeable
in
some
stage
of
the
process
)
,
I
resolve
to
go
to
the
play
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Covent
Garden
Theatre
that
I
choose
;
and
there
,
from
the
back
of
a
centre
box
,
I
see
Julius
Caesar
and
the
new
Pantomime
.
 
<EOS>
to
have
all
those
noble
Romans
alive
before
me
,
and
walk
in
and
out
for
my
entertainment
,
instead
of
be
the
stern
taskmaster
they
have
be
at
school
,
be
a
most
novel
and
delightful
effect
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
mingled
reality
and
mystery
of
the
whole
show
,
the
influence
upon
me
of
the
poetry
,
the
light
,
the
music
,
the
company
,
the
smooth
stupendous
change
of
glittering
and
brilliant
scenery
,
be
so
dazzling
,
and
open
up
such
illimitable
region
of
delight
,
that
when
I
come
out
into
the
rainy
street
,
at
twelve
o'clock
at
night
,
I
feel
as
if
I
have
come
from
the
cloud
,
where
I
have
be
lead
a
romantic
life
for
age
,
to
a
bawling
,
splash
,
link
-
light
,
umbrella
-
struggle
,
hackney
-
coach
-
jostling
,
patten
-
clink
,
muddy
,
miserable
world
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
emerge
by
another
door
,
and
stand
in
the
street
for
a
little
while
,
as
if
I
really
be
a
stranger
upon
earth
:
but
the
unceremonious
pushing
and
hustling
that
I
receive
,
soon
recall
me
to
myself
,
and
put
me
in
the
road
back
to
the
hotel
;
whither
I
go
,
revolve
the
glorious
vision
all
the
way
;
and
where
,
after
some
porter
and
oyster
,
I
sit
revolve
it
still
,
at
past
one
o'clock
,
with
my
eye
on
the
coffee
-
room
fire
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
so
fill
with
the
play
,
and
with
the
past
<EOS>
---
for
it
be
,
in
a
manner
,
like
a
shine
transparency
,
through
which
I
see
my
early
life
move
along
---
that
I
do
not
know
when
the
figure
of
a
handsome
well
-
form
young
man
dress
with
a
tasteful
easy
negligence
which
I
have
reason
to
remember
very
well
,
become
a
real
presence
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
recollect
be
conscious
of
his
company
without
have
notice
his
come
in
---
and
my
still
sit
,
muse
,
over
the
coffee
-
room
fire
.
   
<EOS>
at
last
I
rise
to
go
to
bed
,
much
to
the
relief
of
the
sleepy
waiter
,
who
have
get
the
fidget
in
his
leg
,
and
be
twist
them
,
and
hit
them
,
and
put
them
through
all
kind
of
contortion
in
his
small
pantry
.
 
<EOS>
in
go
towards
the
door
,
I
pass
the
person
who
have
come
in
,
and
see
him
plainly
.
 
<EOS>
I
turn
directly
,
come
back
,
and
look
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
me
,
but
I
know
him
in
a
moment
.
   
<EOS>
at
another
time
I
may
have
want
the
confidence
or
the
decision
to
speak
to
him
,
and
may
have
put
it
off
until
next
day
,
and
may
have
lose
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
in
the
then
condition
of
my
mind
,
where
the
play
be
still
run
high
,
his
former
protection
of
me
appear
so
deserving
of
my
gratitude
,
and
my
old
love
for
him
overflow
my
breast
so
freshly
and
spontaneously
,
that
I
go
up
to
him
at
once
,
with
a
fast
-
beat
heart
,
and
say
:
   
"
steerforth
!
<EOS>
will
not
you
speak
to
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
look
at
me
---
just
as
he
use
to
look
,
sometimes
---
<EOS>
but
I
see
no
recognition
in
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
remember
me
,
I
be
afraid
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
My
God
!
"
<EOS>
he
suddenly
exclaim
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
little
Copperfield
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
grasp
him
by
both
hand
,
and
could
not
let
them
go
.
 
<EOS>
but
for
very
shame
,
and
the
fear

It
be
now
pretty
late
,
we
take
our
candle
and
go
upstairs
,
where
we
part
with
friendly
heartiness
at
his

where
I
find

great
improvement

Chapter

<EOS>
Steerforth
's
home
 
<EOS>
when
the
chambermaid
tap
at
my
door
at
eight
o'clock
,
and
inform
me
that
my
shaving
-
water
be
outside
,
I
feel
severely
the
have
no
occasion
for
it
,
and
blush
in
my
bed
.
 
<EOS>
the
suspicion
that
she
laugh
too
,
when
she
say
it
,
prey
upon
my
mind
all
the
time
I
be
dress
;
and
give
me
,
<EOS>
I
be
conscious
,
a
sneaking
and
guilty
air
when
I
pass
her
on
the
staircase
,
as
I
be
go
down
to
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
sensitively
aware
,
indeed
,
of
be
young
than
I
could
have
wish
,
that
for
some
time
I
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
pass
her
at
all
,
under
the
ignoble
circumstance
of
the
case
;
but
,
hear
her
there
with
a
broom
,
stand
peep
out
of
window
at
King
Charles
on
horseback
,
surround
by
a
maze
of
hackney
-
coach
,
and
look
anything
but
regal
in
a
drizzling
rain
and
a
dark
-
brown
fog
,
until
I
be
admonish
by
the
waiter
that
the
gentleman
be
wait
for
me
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
in
the
coffee
-
room
that
I
find
Steerforth
expect
me
,
but
in
a
snug
private
apartment
,
red
-
curtain
and
Turkey
-
carpet
,
where
the
fire
burn
bright
,
and
a
fine
hot
breakfast
be
set
forth
on
a
table
cover
with
a
clean
cloth
;
and
a
cheerful
miniature
of
the
room
,
the
fire
,
the
breakfast
,
Steerforth
,
and
all
,
be
shine
in
the
little
round
mirror
over
the
sideboard
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
rather
bashful
at
first
,
Steerforth
be
so
self
-
possess
,
and
elegant
,
and
superior
to
me
in
all
respect
<EOS>
(
age
include
)
;
but
his
easy
patronage
soon
put
that
to
right
,
and
make
me
quite
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
enough
admire
the
change
he
have
work
in
the
Golden
Cross
;
or
compare
the
dull
forlorn
state
I
have
hold
yesterday
,
with
this
morning
's
comfort
and
this
morning
's
entertainment
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
waiter
's
familiarity
,
it
be
quench
as
if
it
have
never
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
attend
on
us
,
as
I
may
say
,
in
sackcloth
and
ashe
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
Copperfield
,
"
say
Steerforth
,
when
we
be
alone
,
"
I
should
like
to
hear
what
you
be

,
and
where
you
be
go

and
all
about
you

<EOS>
I
feel
as

"
<EOS>
glow
with
pleasure
to
find
that
he
have
still
this
interest
in
me
,
I
tell
him
how
my
aunt
have
propose
the
little
expedition
that
I
have
before
me
,
and
whither
it
tend
.
   
<EOS>
"
as
you
be
in
no
hurry
,
then
,
"
say
Steerforth
,
"
come
home
with
me
to
Highgate
,
and
stay
a
day
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
be
pleased
with
my
mother
---
she
be
a
little
vain
and
prosy
about
me
,
but
that
you
can
forgive
her
---
and
she
will
be
pleased
with
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
be
as
sure
of
that
,
as
you
be
kind
enough
to
say
you
be
,
"
I
answer
,
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
say
Steerforth
,
"
everyone
who
like
me
,
have
a
claim
on
her
that
be
sure
to
be
acknowledge
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
then
I

I
shall
be

I.
   
<EOS>
"
good
!
"
say
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
and
prove
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
go
and
see
the
lion
for
an
hour
or
two
<EOS>
---
it
be
something
to
have
a
fresh
fellow
like
you
to
show
them
to
,
Copperfield
---
and
then
we
will
journey
out
to
Highgate
by
the
coach
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
believe
but
that
I
be
in
a
dream
,
and
that
I
should
wake
presently
in
number
forty
-
four
,
to
the
solitary
box
in
the
coffee
-
room
and
the
familiar
waiter
again
.
 
<EOS>
after
I
have
write
to
my
aunt
and
tell
her
of
my
fortunate
meeting
with
my
admire
old
schoolfellow
,
and
my
acceptance
of
his
invitation
,
we
go
out
in
a
hackney
-
chariot
,
and
see
a
Panorama
and
some
other
sight
,
and
take
a
walk
through
the
Museum
,
where
I
could
not
help
observe
how
much
Steerforth
know
,
on
an
infinite
variety
of
subject
,
and
of
how
little
account
he
seem
to
make
his
knowledge
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
take
a
high
degree
at
college
,
Steerforth
,
"
say
I
,
"
if
you
have
not
do
so
already
;
and
they
will
have
good
reason
to
be
proud
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
take
a
degree
!

<EOS>
cry
Steerforth

<EOS>
"
not
I

<EOS>
my
dear
Daisy

will
you
mind
my
calling
you
Daisy

<EOS>
"
not

that
be
a
good

<EOS>
My
dear
Daisy
,
"
say
Steerforth
,
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
least
desire
or
intention
to
distinguish
myself
in
that
way

<EOS>
I
have
do
quite
sufficient
for
my
purpose

<EOS>
I
find
that
I
be
heavy
company
enough
for

as
I
be

"
   
<EOS>
"
but
the
fame
---
"
I
be
begin
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
romantic
Daisy
!
<EOS>
"
say
Steerforth
,
laugh
still
more
heartily
:
"
why
should
I
trouble
myself
,
that
a
parcel
of
heavy
-
head
fellow
may
gape
and
hold
up

?
 
<EOS>
let
them
do
it
at
some

<EOS>
there
be
fame

he

<EOS>
I
be
abash
at
have
make
so
great
a
mistake
,
and
be
glad
to
change
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
fortunately
it
be
not
difficult
to
do
,
for
Steerforth
could
always
pass
from
one
subject
to
another
with
a
carelessness
and
lightness
that
be
his
own
.
   
<EOS>
lunch
succeed
to
our
sight
-
see
,
and
the
short
winter
day
wear
away
so
fast
,
that
it
be
dusk
when
the
stage
-
coach
stop
with
us
at
an
old
brick
house
at
Highgate
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
an
elderly
lady
,
though
not
very
far
advanced
in
year
,
with
a
proud
carriage
and
a
handsome
face
,
be
in
the
doorway
as
we
alight
;
and
greet
steerforth
as
"
My
dearest
James
,
"
fold
him
in
her
arm
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
lady
he
present
me
as
his
mother
,
and
she
give
me
a
stately
welcome
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
genteel
old
-
fashioned
house
,
very
quiet
and
orderly
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
window
of
my
room
I
see
all
London
lie
in
the
distance
like
a
great
vapour
,
with
here
<EOS>
and
there
some
light
twinkle
through
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
time
,
in
dress
,
to
glance
at
the
solid
furniture
,
the
framed
piece
of
work
(
do
,
I
suppose
,
by
Steerforth
's
mother
when
she
be
a
girl
)
,
and
some
picture
in
crayon
of
lady
with
powder
hair
and
bodice
,
come
and
go
on
the
wall
,
as
the
newly
-
kindle
fire
crackle
and
sputter
,
when
I
be
call
to
dinner
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
second
lady
in
the
dining
-
room
,
of
a
slight
short
figure
,
dark
,
and
not
agreeable
to
look
at
,
but
with
some
appearance
of
good
look
too
,
who
attract
my
attention
:
perhaps
because
I
have
not
expect
to
see
her
;
perhaps
because
I
find
myself
sit
opposite
to
her
;
perhaps
because
of
something
really
remarkable
in
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
black
hair
and
eager
black
eye
,
and
be
thin
,
and
have
a
scar
upon
her
lip
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
old
scar
<EOS>
---
I
should
rather
call
it
seam
,
for
it
be
not
discolour
,
and
have
heal
year
ago
---
which
have
once
cut
through
her
mouth
,
downward
towards
the
chin
,
but
be
now
barely
visible
across
the
table
,
except
above
and
on
her
upper
lip
,
the
shape
of
which
it
have
alter
.
 
<EOS>
I
conclude
in
my
own
mind
that
she
be
about
thirty
year
of
age
,
and
that
she
wish
to
be
marry
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
little
dilapidated
---
like
a
house
---
with
have
be
so
long
to
let
;
yet
have
,
as
I
have
say
,
an
appearance
of
good
look
.
 
<EOS>
Her
thinness
seem
to
be
the
effect
of
some
waste
fire
within
her
,
which
find
a
vent
in
her
gaunt
eye
.
   
<EOS>
She
be
introduce
as
Miss
Dartle
,
and
both
Steerforth
and
his
mother
call
her
Rosa
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
that
she
live
there
,
and
have
be
for
a
long
time
Mrs
Steerforth
's
companion
.
 
<EOS>
It
appear
to
me
that
she
never
say
anything
she
want
to
say
,
outright
;
but
hint
it
,
and
make
a
great
deal
more
of
it
by
this
practice
.
 
<EOS>
for
example
,
when
Mrs
Steerforth
observe
,
more
in
jest
than
earnest
,
that
she
fear
her
son
lead
but
a
wild
life
at
college
,
Miss
Dartle
put
in
thus
:
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
really
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
how
ignorant
I
be
,
and
that
I
only
ask
for
information
,
but
be
not
it
always
so
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
that
kind
of
life
be
on
all
hand
understand
to
be
---
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
education
for
a
very
grave
profession
,
if
you
mean
that
,
Rosa
,
"
Mrs
Steerforth
answer
with
some
coldness
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
yes
!
 
<EOS>
that
be
very
true
,
"
return
Miss
Dartle
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
be
not
it
,
though
?
<EOS>
---
I
want
to
be
put
right
,
if
I
be
wrong
---
be
not
it
,
really
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
really
what
?
"
say
Mrs
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
You
mean
it
be
not
!
"
return
Miss
Dartle
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
be
very
glad
to
hear
it
!
 
<EOS>
now
,
I
know
what
to
do
!
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
advantage
of
ask
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
allow
people
to
talk
before
me
about
wastefulness
and
profligacy
,
and
so
forth
,
in
connexion
with
that
life
,
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
and
you
will
be
right
,
"
say
Mrs
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
son
's
tutor
be
a
conscientious
gentleman
;
and
if
I
have
not
implicit
reliance
on
my
son
,
I
should
have
reliance
on
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Should
you
?
"
say
Miss
Dartle
.
 
<EOS>
"
dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
Conscientious
,
be
he
?
<EOS>
really
conscientious
,
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
be
convinced
of
it
,
"
say
Mrs
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
how
very
nice
!
"
exclaim
Miss
Dartle
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
a
comfort
!
 
<EOS>
really
conscientious
?
 
<EOS>
then
he
be
not
---
<EOS>
but
of
course
he
can
not
be
,
if
he
be
really
conscientious
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
shall
be
quite
happy
in
my
opinion
of
him
,
from
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
think
how
it
elevate
him
in
my
opinion
,
to
know
for
certain
that
he
be
really
conscientious
!
"
   
<EOS>
Her
own
view
of
every
question
,
and
her
correction
of
everything
that
be
say
to
which
she
be
oppose
,
Miss
Dartle
insinuate
in
the
same
way
:
sometimes
,
I
could
not
conceal
from
myself
,
with
great
power
,
though
in
contradiction
even
of
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
an
instance
happen
before
dinner
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Steerforth
speak
to
me
about
my
intention
of
go
down
into
Suffolk
<EOS>
,
I
say
at
hazard
how
glad
I
should
be
,
if
Steerforth
would
only
go
there
with
me
;
and
explain
to
him
that
I
be
go
to
see
my
old
nurse
,
and
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
's
family
<EOS>
,
I
remind
him
of
the
boatman
whom
he
have
see
at
school
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
that
bluff
fellow
!
"
say
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
have
a
son
with
him
,
have
not
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
his
nephew
,
"
I
reply
;
"
whom
he
adopt
,
though
,
as
a
son
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
very
pretty
little
niece
too
,
whom
he
adopt
as
a
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
his
house
---
or
rather
his
boat
,
for
he
live
in
one
,
on
dry
land
---
be
full
of
people
who
be
object
of
his
generosity
and
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
be
delighted
to
see
that
household
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Should
I
?
"
say
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
think
I
should
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
see
what
can
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
worth
a
journey
(
not
to
mention
the
pleasure
of
a
journey
with
you
,
Daisy
)
,
to
see
that
sort
of
people
together
,
and
to
make
one
of
'
em
.
"
   
<EOS>
My
heart
leap
with
a
new
hope
of
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
in
reference
to
the
tone
in
which
he
have
speak
of
"
that
sort
of
people
"
,
that
Miss
Dartle
,
whose
sparkling
eye
have
be
watchful
of
us
,
now
break
in
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
but
,
really
?
 
<EOS>
do
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
be
they
,
though
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
they
what
?
 
<EOS>
and
be
who
what
?
"
say
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
sort
of
people
.
 
<EOS>
---
be
they
really
animal
and
clod
,
and
being
of
another
order
?
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
so
much
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
there
be
a
pretty
wide
separation
between
them
and
us
,
"
say
Steerforth
,
with
indifference
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
be
not
to
be
expect
to
be
as
sensitive
as
we
be
.
 
<EOS>
Their
delicacy
be
not
to
be
shock
,
or
hurt
easily
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
wonderfully
virtuous
,
I
dare
say
---
some
people
contend
for
that
,
at
least
;
and
I
be
sure
I
do
not
want
to
contradict
them
---
but
they
have
not
very
fine
nature
,
and
they
may
be
thankful
that
,
like
their
coarse
rough
skin
,
they
be
not
easily
wound
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
really
!
"
say
Miss
Dartle
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
do
not
know
,
now
,
when
I
have
be
better
pleased
than
to
hear
that
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
consoling
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
such
a
delight
to
know
that
,
when
they
suffer
,
they
do
not
feel
!
<EOS>
sometimes
I
have
be
quite
uneasy
for
that
sort
of
people
;
but
now
I
shall
just
dismiss
the
idea
of
them
,
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
live
and
learn
.
<EOS>
I
have
my
doubt
,
I
confess
,
but
now
they
be
clear
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
,
and
now
I
do
know
,
and
that
show
the
advantage
of
asking
---
do
not
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
believe
that
Steerforth
have
say
what
he
have
,
in
jest
,
or
to
draw
Miss
Dartle
out
;
and
I
expect
him
to
say
as
much
when
she
be
go
,
and
we
two
be
sit
before
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
merely
ask
me
what
I
think
of
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
be
very
clever
,
be
she
not
?
"
I
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
Clever
!
 
<EOS>
She
bring
everything
to
a
grindstone
,
"
say
Steerforth
,
"
and
sharpen
it
,
as
she
have
sharpen
her
own
face
and
figure
these
year
past
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
wear
herself
away
by
constant
sharpening
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
all
edge
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
what
a
remarkable
scar
that
be
upon
her
lip
!
"
<EOS>
I
say
.
   
<EOS>
Steerforth
's
face
fall
,
and
he
pause
a
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
the
fact
be
,
"
he
return
,
"
I
do
that

<EOS>

by
an
unfortunate
accident

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no

<EOS>
I
be
a
young
boy
,
and
she
exasperate
me
,
and
I
throw
a
hammer
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
a
promising
young
angel
<EOS>
I
must
have
be
!
<EOS>
"
I
be
deeply
sorry
to
have
touch
on
such
a
painful
theme

that
be
useless
now
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
have
bear
the
mark
ever
since
,
as
you
see
,
"
say
Steerforth
;
"
and
she
will
bear
it
to
her
grave
,
if
she
ever
rest
in
one

though
I
can
hardly
believe
she
will
ever
rest
anywhere

She
be
the
motherless
child
of
a
sort

cousin

My

the
history
of

I
have
no

she
love
you

I.
   
"
Humph
!

<EOS>
retort
Steerforth
,
look
at
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>

some
brother
be
not
love
over
much

some
love

help
yourself
,
Copperfield
!
 
<EOS>
We
will
drink
the
daisy
of
the
field
,
in
compliment
to
you
;
and
the
lily
of
the
valley
that
toil
not

neither
do

spin

in
compliment

the
more
shame
for

<EOS>
a
moody
smile
that
have
overspread
his
feature
clear
off
as
he
say
this
merrily
,
and
he
be
his
own
frank
,
win
self
again

<EOS>
I
could
not
help
glance
at
the
scar
with
a
painful
interest
when
we
go
in
to
tea
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
before
I
observe
that
it
be
the
most
susceptible
part
of
her
face
,
and
that
,
when
she
turn
pale
,
that
mark
alter
first
,
and
become
a
dull
,
lead
-
coloured
streak
,
lengthen
out
to
its
full
extent
,
like
a
mark
in
invisible
ink
bring
to
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
altercation
between
her
and
Steerforth
about
a
cast
of
the
dice
at
back
gammon
---
when
I
think
her
,
for
one
moment
,
in
a
storm
of
rage
;
and
then
I
see
it
start
forth
like
the
old
writing
on
the
wall
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
no
matter
of
wonder
to
me
to
find
Mrs
Steerforth
devoted
to
her
son
.
 
<EOS>
She
seem
to
be
able
to
speak
or
think
about
nothing
else
.
 
<EOS>
She
show
me
his
picture
as
an
infant
,
in
a
locket
,
with
some
of
his
baby
-
hair
in
it
;
she
show
me
his
picture
as
he
have
be
when
I
first
know
him
;
and
she
wear
at
her
breast
his
picture
as
he
be
now
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
letter
he
have
ever
write
to
her
<EOS>
,
she
keep
in
a
cabinet
near
her
own
chair
by
the
fire
;
and
she
would
have
read
me
some
of
them
,
and
I
should
have
be
very
glad
to
hear
them
too
,
if
he
have
not
interpose
,
and
coax
her
out
of
the
design
.
   
<EOS>
"
It

at
Mr
Creakle

,
my

me

Mrs
Steerforth
,
as
she
and
I
be
talk
at
one
table
,
while
they
play
backgammon
at
another

<EOS>
"
indeed
,
I
recollect
his
speaking
,
at
that
time
,
of
a
pupil
young
than
himself
who
have
take
his
fancy
there
;
but
your
name
,
as
you
may
suppose
,
have
not
live
in

"
   
<EOS>
"
He
be
very
generous

noble
to
me
in
those
day

I
assure
you
,
madam

"
say
I
,
"
and
I
stand
in
need
of
such
a
friend

<EOS>
I
should
have
be
quite
crush
without
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
be
always
generous
and
noble
,
"
say
Mrs
Steerforth
,
proudly
.
   
<EOS>
I
subscribe
to
this
with
all
my
heart
,
God
know
.
 
<EOS>
She
know
I
do
;
for
the
stateliness
of
her
manner
already
abate
towards
me
,
except
when
she
speak
in
praise
of
him
,
and
then
her
air
be
always
lofty
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
a
fit
school
generally
for
my
son
,
"
say
she
;
"
far
from
it
;
but
there
be
particular
circumstance
to
be
consider
at
the
time
,
of
more
importance
even
than
that
selection
.
 
<EOS>
My
son
's
high
spirit
make
it
desirable
that
he
should
be
place
with
some
man
who
feel
its
superiority
,
and
would
be
content
to
bow
himself
before
it
;
and
we
find
such
a
man
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
know
that
,
know
the
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
do
not
despise
him
the
more
for
it
,
but
think
it
a
redeeming
quality
in
him
if
he
could
be
allow
any
grace
for
not
resist
one
so
irresistible
as
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
son
's
great
capacity
be
tempt
on
,
there
,
by
a
feeling
of
voluntary
emulation
and
conscious
pride
,
"
the
fond
lady
go
on
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
would
have
rise
against
all
constraint
;
but
he
find
himself
the
monarch
of
the
place
,
and
he
haughtily
determine
to
be
worthy
of
his
station
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
like
himself
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
echo
,
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
,
that
it
be
like
himself

<EOS>
"
so
my
son
take
,
of
his
own
will
,
and
on
no
compulsion
,
to
the
course
in
which
he
can
always
,
when
it
be
his
pleasure
,
outstrip
every
competitor
,
"
she
pursue
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
son
inform
me
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
that
you
be
quite
devoted
to
him
,
and
that
when
you
meet
yesterday
you
make
yourself
known
to
him
with
tear
of
joy

<EOS>
I
should
be
an
affected
woman
if
I
make
any
pretence
of
be
surprise
by
my
son
's
inspire
such
emotion
;
but
I
can
not
be
indifferent
to
anyone
who
be
so
sensible
of
his
merit
,
and
I
be
very
glad
to
see
you
here
,
and
can
assure
you
that
he
feel
an
unusual
friendship
for
you
,

that
you
may
rely
on
his
protection

<EOS>
Miss
Dartle
play
backgammon
as
eagerly
as
she
do
everything
else

<EOS>
if
I
have
see
her
,
first
,
at
the
board

I
should
have
fancy
that
her
figure
have
get
thin

and
her
eye
have
get
large
,
over
that
pursuit

no

I
be

much
mistake

mine

I

<EOS>
when
the
evening
be
pretty
far
spend
,
and
a
tray
of
glass
and
decanter
come
in
,
<EOS>
Steerforth
promise
,
over
the
fire
,
that
he
would
seriously
think
of
go
down
into
the
country
with
me
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
hurry
,
he
say
;
a
week
hence
would
do
;
and
his
mother
hospitably
say
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
while
we
be
talk
,
he
more
than
once
call
me
Daisy
;
which
bring
Miss
Dartle
out
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
really
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
she
ask
,
"
be
it
a
nickname
?
 
<EOS>
and
why
do
he
give
it
you
?
 
<EOS>
be
it
---
eh
?
---
because
he
think
you
young
and
innocent
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
stupid
in
these
thing
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
colour
in
reply
that
I
believe
it
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
say
Miss
Dartle
.
 
<EOS>
"
now
I
be
glad
to
know
that
!
 
<EOS>
I
ask
for
information
,
and
I
be
glad
to
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
you
young
and
innocent
;
and
so
you
be
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
that
be
quite
delightful
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
go
to
bed
soon
after
this
,
and
Mrs
Steerforth
retire
too
.
<EOS>
steerforth
and
I
,
after
linger
for
half
-
an
-
hour
over
the
fire
,
talk
about
Traddles
and
all
the
rest
of
them
at
old
Salem
House
,
go
upstairs
together
.
 
<EOS>
Steerforth
's
room
be
next
to
mine
,
and
I
go
in
to
look
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
picture
of
comfort
,
full
of
easy
-
chair
,
cushion
and
footstool
,
work
by
his
mother
's
hand
,
and
with
no
sort
of
thing
omit
that
could
help
to
render
it
complete
.
 
<EOS>
finally
,
her
handsome
feature
look
down
on
her
darling
from
a
portrait
on
the
wall
,
as
if
it
be
even
something
to
her
that
her
likeness
should
watch
him
while
he
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
I
find
the
fire
burn
clear
enough
in
my
room
by
this
time
,
and
the
curtain
draw
before
the
window
and
round
the
bed
,
give
it
a
very
snug
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
down
in
a
great
chair
upon
the
hearth
to
meditate
on
my
happiness
;
and
have
enjoy
the
contemplation
of
it
for
some
time
,
when
I
find
a
likeness
of
Miss
Dartle
look
eagerly
at
me
from
above
the
chimney
-
piece
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
startling
likeness
,
and
necessarily
have
a
startling
look
.
<EOS>
the
painter
have
not
make
the
scar
,
but
I
make
it
;
and
there
it
be
,
come
and
go
;
now
confine
to
the
upper
lip
as
I
have
see
it
at
dinner
,
and
now
show
the
whole
extent
of
the
wound
inflict
by
the
hammer
,
as
I
have
see
it
when
she
be
passionate
.
   
<EOS>
I
wonder
peevishly
why
they
could
not
put
her
anywhere
else
instead
of
quarter
her
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
to
get
rid
of
her
,
I
undress
quickly
,
extinguish
my
light
,
and
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
fall
asleep
,
I
could
not
forget
that
she
be
still
there
look
,
"
be
it
really
,
though
?
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
"
;
and
when
I
awoke
in
the
night
,
I
find
that
I
be
uneasily
ask
all
sort
of
people
in
my
dream
whether
it
really
be
or
not
---
without
know
what
I
mean
.

Chapter
21
.
<EOS>
little
em'ly
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
servant
in
that
house
,
a
man
who
,
I
understand
,
be
usually
with
Steerforth
,
and
have
come
into
his
service
at
the
University
,
who
be
in
appearance
a
pattern
of
respectability
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
there
never
exist
in
his
station
a
more
respectable
-
looking
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
taciturn
,
soft
-
footed
,
very
quiet
in
his
manner
,
deferential
,
observant
,
always
at
hand
when
want
,
and
never
near
when
not
want
;
but
his
great
claim
to
consideration
be
his
respectability
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
a
pliant
face
,
he
have
rather
a
stiff
neck
,
rather
a
tight
smooth
head
with
short
hair
cling
to
it
at
the
side
,
a
soft
way
of
speak
,
with
a
peculiar
habit
of
whisper
the
letter
<EOS>
S^
<EOS>
so
distinctly
,
that
he
seem
to
use
it
oftener
than
any
other
man
;
but
every
peculiarity
that
he
have
he
make
respectable
.
 
<EOS>
if
his
nose
have
be
upside
-
down
,
he
would
have
make
that
respectable
.
 
<EOS>
He
surround
himself
with
an
atmosphere
of
respectability
,
and
walk
secure
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
next
to
impossible
to
suspect
him
of
anything
wrong
,
he
be
so
thoroughly
respectable
.
 
<EOS>
nobody
could
have
think
of
put
him
in
a
livery
,
he
be
so
highly
respectable
.
 
<EOS>
to
have
impose
any
derogatory
work
upon
him
,
would
have
be
to
inflict
a
wanton
insult
on
the
feeling
of
a
most
respectable
man
.
 
<EOS>
and
of
this
,
I
notice
---
<EOS>
the
woman
-
servant
in
the
household
be
so
intuitively
conscious
,
that
they
always
do
such
work
themselves
,
and
generally
while
he
read
the
paper
by
the
pantry
fire
.
   
<EOS>
such
a
self
-
contain
man
I
never
see
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
that
quality
,
as
in
every
other
he
possess
,
he
only
seem
to
be
the
more
respectable
.
 
<EOS>
even
the
fact
that
no
one
know
his
christian
name
,
seem
to
form
a
part
of
his
respectability
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
object
against
his
surname
,
Littimer
,
by
which
he
be
know
.
<EOS>
Peter
may
have
be
hang
,
or
Tom
transport
;
but
Littimer
be
perfectly
respectable
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
occasion
,
I
suppose
,
by
the
reverend
nature
of
respectability
in
the
abstract
,
but
I
feel
particularly
young
in
this
man
's
presence
.
 
<EOS>
how
old
he
be
himself
,
I
could
not
guess
---
and
that
again
go
to
his
credit
on
the
same
score
;
for
in
the
calmness
of
respectability
he
may
have
number
fifty
year
as
well
as
thirty
.
   
<EOS>
Littimer
be
in
my
room
in
the
morning
before
I
be
up
,
to
bring
me
that
reproachful
shaving
-
water
,
and
to
put
out
my
clothe
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
undrew
the
curtain
and
look
out
of
bed
,
I
see
him
,
in
an
equable
temperature
of
respectability
,
unaffected
by
the
east
wind
of
January
,
and
not
even
breathe
frostily
,
stand
my
boot
right
and
leave
in
the
first
dancing
position
,
and
blow
speck
of
dust
off
my
coat
as
he
lay
it
down
like
a
baby
.
   
<EOS>
I
give
him
good
morning
,
and
ask
him
what
o'clock
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
out
of
his
pocket
the
most
respectable
hunting
-
watch
I
ever
see
,
and
prevent
the
spring
with
his
thumb
from
open
far
,
look
in
at
the
face
as
if
he
be
consult
an
oracular
oyster
,
shut
it
up
again
,
and
say
,
if
I
please
,
it
be
half
past
eight
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Steerforth
will
be
glad
to
hear
how
you
have
rest
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
"
say
I
,
"
very
well
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
be
Mr
Steerforth
quite
well
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
sir
,
Mr
Steerforth
be
tolerably
well
.
"
 
<EOS>
another
of
his
characteristic
---
no
use
of
superlative
.
 
<EOS>
a
cool
calm
medium
always
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
there
anything
more
I
can
have
the
honour
of
do
for
you
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
the
warning
-
bell
will
ring
at
nine
;
the
family
take
breakfast
at
half
past
nine
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
nothing
,
I
thank
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
,
sir
,
if
you
please
"
;
and
with
that
,
and
with
a
little
inclination
of
his
head
when
he
pass
the
bed
-
side
,
as
an
apology
for
correct
me
,
he
go
out
,
shut
the
door
as
delicately
as
if
I
have
just
fall
into
a
sweet
sleep
on
which
my
life
depend
.
   
<EOS>
every
morning
we
hold
exactly
this
conversation
:
never
any
more
,
and
never
any
less
:
and
yet
,
invariably
,
however
far
I
may
have
be
lift
out
of
myself
over
-
night
,
and
advanced
towards
maturer
year
,
by
Steerforth
's
companionship
,
or
Mrs
Steerforth
's
confidence
,
or
Miss
Dartle
's
conversation
,
in
the
presence
of
this
most
respectable
man
I
become
,
as
our
small
poet
sing
,
"
a
boy
again
"
.
   
<EOS>
He
get
horse
for
us
;
and
Steerforth
,
who
know
everything
,
give
me
lesson
in
ride
.
 
<EOS>
He
provide
foil
for
us
,
and
Steerforth
give
me
lesson
in
fence
---
glove
,
and
I
begin
,
of
the
same
master
,
to
improve
in
boxing
.
 
<EOS>
It
give
me
no
manner
of
concern
that
Steerforth
should
find
me
a
novice
in
these
science
,
but
I
never
could
bear
to
show
my
want
of
skill
before
the
respectable
Littimer
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
Littimer
understand
such
art
himself
;
he
never
lead
me
to
suppose
anything
of
the
kind
,
by
so
much
as
the
vibration
of
one
of
his
respectable
eyelash
;
yet
whenever
he
be
by
,
while
we
be
practise
<EOS>
,
I
feel
myself
the
green
and
most
inexperienced
of
mortal
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
particular
about
this
man
,
because
he
make
a
particular
effect
on
me
at
that
time
,
and
because
of
what
take
place
thereafter
.
   
<EOS>
the
week
pass
away
in
a
most
delightful
manner
.
 
<EOS>
It
pass
rapidly
,
as
may
be
suppose
,
to
one
entrance
as
I
be
;
and
yet
it
give
me
so
many
occasion
for
know
Steerforth
better
,
and
admire
him
more
in
a
thousand
respect
,
that
at
its
close
I
seem
to
have
be
with
him
for
a
much
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
a
dashing
way
he
have
of
treat
me
like
a
plaything
,
be
more
agreeable
to
me
than
any
behaviour
he
could
have
adopt
.
 
<EOS>
It
remind
me
of
our
old
acquaintance
;
it
seem
the
natural
sequel
of
it
;
it
show
me
that
he
be
unchanged
;
it
relieve
me
of
any
uneasiness
I
may
have
feel
,
in
compare
my
merit
with
his
,
and
measure
my
claim
upon
his
friendship
by
any
equal
standard
;
above
all
,
it
be
a
familiar
,
unrestrained
,
affectionate
demeanour
that
he
use
towards
no
one
else
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
have
treat
me
at
school
differently
from
all
the
rest
,
I
joyfully
believe
that
he
treat
me
in
life
unlike
any
other
friend
he
have
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
that
I
be
near
to
his
heart
than
any
other
friend
,
and
my
own
heart
warm
with
attachment
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
make
up
his
mind
to
go
with
me
into
the
country
,
and
the
day
arrive
for
our
departure
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
doubtful
at
first
whether
to
take
Littimer
or
not
,
but
decide
to
leave
him
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
the
respectable
creature
,
satisfied
with
his
lot
whatever
it
be
,
arrange
our
portmanteaux
on
the
little
carriage
that
be
to
take
us
into
London
,
as
if
they
be
intend
to
defy
the
shock
of
age
,
and
receive
my
modestly
proffer
donation
with
perfect
tranquillity
.
   
<EOS>
We
bade
adieu
to
Mrs
Steerforth
and
Miss
Dartle
,
with
many
thank
on
my
part
,
and
much
kindness
on
the
devoted
mother
's
.
 
<EOS>
the
last
thing
I
see
be
Littimer
's
unruffled
eye
;
fraught
,
as
I
fancy
,
with
the
silent
conviction
that
I
be
very
young
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
what
I
feel
,
in
return
so
auspiciously
to
the
old
familiar
place
,
I
shall
not
endeavour
to
describe
.
 
<EOS>
We
go
down
by
the
Mail
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
concerned
<EOS>
,
I
recollect
,
even
for
the
honour
of
Yarmouth
,
that
when
Steerforth
say
,
as
we
drive
through
its
dark
street
to
the
inn
,
that
,
as
well
as
he
could
make
out
,
it
be
a
good
,
queer
,
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
kind
of
hole
,
I
be
highly
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
We
go
to
bed
on
our
arrival
<EOS>
(
I
observe
a
pair
of
dirty
shoe
and
gaiter
in
connexion
with
my
old
friend
the
Dolphin
as
we
pass
that
door
)
,
and
breakfast
late
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Steerforth
,
who
be
in
great
spirit
,
have
be
stroll
about
the
beach
before
I
be
up
,
and
have
make
acquaintance
,
he
say
,
with
half
the
boatman
in
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
moreover
,
he
have
see
,
in
the
distance
,
what
he
be
sure
must
be
the
identical
house
of
Mr
Peggotty
,
with
smoke
come
out
of
the
chimney
;
and
have
have
a
great
mind
,
he
tell
me
,
to
walk
in
and
swear
he
be
myself
grow
out
of
knowledge
.
   
<EOS>
"
when
do
you
propose
to
introduce
me
there
,
Daisy
?
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
at
your
disposal
.
 
<EOS>
make
your
own
arrangement
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
be
think
that
this
evening
would
be
a
good
time
,
Steerforth
,
when
they
be
all
sit
round
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
like
you
to
see
it
<EOS>
when
it
be
snug
,
it
be
such
a
curious
place
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
so
be
it
!
"
<EOS>
return
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
evening
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
give
them
any
notice
that
we
be
here
,
you
know
,
"
say
I
,
delighted
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
take
them
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
of
course
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
fun
,
"
say
Steerforth
,
"
unless
we
take
them
by
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
see
the
native
in
their
aboriginal
condition
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
though
they
are
that
sort
of
people
that
you
mention
,
"
I
return
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
aha
!
 
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
you
recollect
my
skirmish
with
Rosa
,
do
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
with
a
quick
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
confound
the
girl
,
I
be
half
afraid

She

never

<EOS>
now
what
be

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
why

yes

"
I

,
"
I
must
see
Peggotty
first
of
all

"
   
<EOS>
"

"
reply
Steerforth
,
look
at
his
watch
.
 
<EOS>
"
suppose
I
deliver
you
up
to

cry
over

a
couple
of
hour

<EOS>
be
that
long
enough

"
   
<EOS>
I
answer
,
laugh
,
that
I
think
we
may
get
through
it
in
that
time
,
but
that
he
must
come
also
;
for
he
would
find
that
his
renown
have
precede
him
,
and
that
he
be
almost
as
great
a
personage
as
I
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
come
anywhere
you
like
,
"
say
Steerforth
,
"
or
do
anything
you
like

<EOS>
tell
me
where
to
come
to

in
two
hour
I

produce
myself
in
any
state
you
please

sentimental
or
comical
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
give
him
minute
direction
for
find
the
residence
of
Mr
Barkis
,
carrier
to
Blunderstone
and
elsewhere
;
and
,
on
this
understanding
,
go
out
alone
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
sharp
bracing
air
;
the
ground
be
dry
;
the
sea
be
crisp
and
clear
;
the
sun
be
diffuse
abundance
of
light
,
if
not
much
warmth
;
and
everything
be
fresh
and
lively
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
fresh
and
lively
myself
,
in
the
pleasure
of
be
there
,
that
I
could
have
stop
the
people
in
the
street
and
shake
hand
with
them
.
   
<EOS>
the
street
look
small
,
of

.
 
<EOS>
the
street
that
we
have
only
see
as
child
always
do
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
when
we
go
back
to
them

<EOS>
but
I
have
forget
nothing
in
them

and
find
nothing
change
,
until
I
come

Mr

<EOS>
OMER

My

<EOS>
the

in

well
,
sir

we
have
get
a

here

under

that
have
as
elegant
a
taste
in

make
business

---
I
assure
you
<EOS>
I
do
not

there
be
a

"
   
<EOS>
"
not

Em'ly
's
her
name
,
"
say
Mr

,
"
and
she
be
little
too

<EOS>
but
if
you
will
believe
me
,
she
have
such
a
face
of
her
own
that
half
the
woman
in
this
town
be
mad
against
her

<EOS>
"
nonsense

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My

Mr

,
"
I
do
not
say
it
be
the
case
with
you

"
wink
at
me

"
but
<EOS>
I
say
that
half
the
woman
in
Yarmouth
---
ah
!
<EOS>
and
in
five
mile
round
---
be
mad
against
that
girl
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
then
she
should
have
keep
to
her
own
station
in
life
,
father
,
"
say
Minnie
,
"
and
not
have
give
them
any
hold
to
talk

they

<EOS>

Could

that
your

<EOS>
what
be
there
that
any

could
not

that
she
should
not
do
---
especially
on
the
subject
of
another
woman
's
good
look
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
really
think
it
be
all
over
with
Mr
Omer
,
after
he
have
utter
this
libellous
pleasantry
.
 
<EOS>
He
cough
to
that
extent
,
and
his
breath
elude
all
his
attempt
to
recover
it
with
that
obstinacy
,
that
I
fully
expect
to
see
his
head
go
down
behind
the
counter
,
and
his
little
black
breech
,
with
the
rusty
little
bunche
of
ribbon
at
the
knee
,
come
quiver
up
in
a
last
ineffectual
struggle
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
he
get
better
,
though
he
still
pant
hard
,
and
be
so
exhausted
that
he
be
oblige
to
sit
on
the
stool
of
the
shop
-
desk
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
he
say
,
wipe
his
head
,
and
breathe
with
difficulty
,
"
she
have
not
take
much
to
any
companion
here
;
she
have
not
take
kindly
to
any
particular
acquaintance
and
friend
,
not
to
mention
sweetheart
.
 
<EOS>
in
consequence
,
an
ill
-
natured
story
get
about
,
that
Em'ly
want
to
be
a
lady
.
 
<EOS>
now
my
opinion
be
,
that
it
come
into
circulation
principally
on
account
of
her
sometimes
say
,
at
the
school
,
that
if
she
be
a
lady
she
would
like
to
do
so
-
and
-
so
for
her
uncle
---
<EOS>
do
not
you
see
?
---
and
buy
him
such
-
and
-
such
fine
thing
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
Mr
Omer
,
she
have
say
so
to
me
,
"
I
return
eagerly
,
"
when
we
be
both
child
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Omer
nod
his
head
and
rub
his
chin
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
just
so
.
 
<EOS>
then
out
of
a
very
little
,
she
could
dress
herself
,
you
see
,
well
than
most
other
<EOS>
could
out
of
a
deal
,
and
that
make
thing
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
she
be
rather
what
may
be
call
wayward
---
I
will
go
so
far
as
to
say
what
I
should
call
wayward
myself
,
"
say
Mr
Omer
;
"
---
do
not
know
her
own
mind
quite
---
a
little
spoiled
---
and
could
not
,
at
first
,
exactly
bind
herself
down
.
 
<EOS>
no
more
than
that
be
ever
say
against
her
,
Minnie
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
father
,
"

Mrs
Joram
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
bad
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
so
when
she
get
a
situation
,
"
say
Mr
Omer
,
"
to
keep
a
fractious
old
lady
company
,
they
do
not
very
well
agree
,
and
she
do
not
stop
.
<EOS>
at
last
she
come
here
,
apprentice
for
three
year
.
 
<EOS>
nearly
two
of
'em
be
over
,
and
she
have
be
as
good
a
girl
as
ever
be
.
 
<EOS>
Worth
any
six
!
 
<EOS>
Minnie
,
be
she
worth
any
six
,
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
father
,
"
reply
Minnie
.
 
<EOS>
"
never
say
I
detract
from
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
very
good
,
"
say
Mr
Omer
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
right
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
young
gentleman
<EOS>
,
"
he
add
,
after
a
few
moment
'
further
rubbing
of
his
chin
,
"
that
you
may
not
consider
me
long
-
winded
as
well
as
short
-
breathed
,
I
believe
that
be
all
about
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
as
they
have
speak
in
a
subdued
tone
,
while
speak
of
Em'ly
,
I
have
no
doubt
that
she
be
near
.
 
<EOS>
on
my
asking
now
,
if
that
be
not
so
,
Mr
Omer
nod
yes
,
and
nod
towards
the
door
of
the
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
My
hurried
inquiry
if
I
may
peep
in
,
be
answer
with
a
free
permission
;
and
,
look
through
the
glass
,
I
see
her
sit
at
her
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
her
,
a
most
beautiful
little
creature
,
with
the
cloudless
blue
eye
,
that
have
look
into
my
childish
heart
,
turn
laughingly
upon
another
child
of
Minnie
's
who
be
play
near
her
;
with
enough
of
wilfulness
in
her
bright
face
to
justify
what
I
have
hear
;
with
much
of
the
old
capricious
coyness
lurk
in
it
;
but
with
nothing
in
her
pretty
look
,
I
be
sure
,
but
what
be
mean
for
goodness
and
for
happiness
,
and
what
be
on
a
good
and
   
happy
course
.
   
<EOS>
the
tune
across
the
yard
that
seem
as
if
it
never

leave
off

alas

<EOS>
it
be
the
tune
that
never

leave
off

softly

all
the

you
like
to
step
in
,
"
say
Mr
Omer
,
"
and
speak
to
her
?
<EOS>
walk
in
and
speak
to
her
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
make
yourself
at
home
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
too
bashful
to
do
<EOS>
so
then
---
I
be
afraid
of
confuse
her
,
and
I
be
no
less
afraid
of
confuse
myself
.
<EOS>
---
but
I
inform
myself
of
the
hour
at
which
she
leave
of
an
evening
,
in
order
that
our
visit
may
be
time
accordingly
;
and
take
leave
of
Mr
Omer
,
and
his
pretty
daughter
,
and
her
little
child
,
go
away
to
my
dear
old
Peggotty
's
.
   
<EOS>
here
she
be
,
in
the
tile
kitchen
,
cooking
dinner
!
 
<EOS>
the
moment
I
knock
at
the
door
she
open
it
,
and
ask
me
what
I
please
to
want
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
at
her
with
a
smile
,
but
she
give
me
no
smile
in
return
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
cease
to
write
to
her
,
but
it
must
have
be
seven
year
since
we
have
meet
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
Mr
Barkis
at
home
,
madam
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
feign
to
speak
roughly
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
be
at
home
,
sir
,
"
return
Peggotty
,
"
but
he
be
bad
abe
with
the
rheumatic
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
not
he
go
over
to
Blunderstone
now
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
when
he
be
well
he
do
,
"
she
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
ever
go
there
,
Mrs
Barkis
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
look
at
me
more
attentively
,
and
I
notice
a
quick
movement
of
her
hand
towards
each
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
because
I
want
to
ask
a
question
about
a
house
there
,
that
they
call
the
<EOS>
---
what
be
it
?
<EOS>
---
the
Rookery
,
"
say
<EOS>
I.
   
She
take
a
step
backward
,
and
put
out
her
hand
in
an
undecided
frightened
way
,
as
if
to
keep
me
off
.
   
<EOS>
"
peggotty
!
<EOS>
"
I
cry
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
She
cry
,
"
My
darling
boy
!
"
<EOS>
and
we
both
burst
into
tear
,
and
be
lock
in
one
another
's
arm
.
   
<EOS>
what
extravagance
she
commit
;
what
laugh
and
cry
over
me
;
what
pride
she
show
,
what
joy
,
what
sorrow
that
she
whose
pride
and
joy
<EOS>
I
may
have
be
,
could
never
hold
me
in
a
fond
embrace
;
I
have
not
the
heart
to
tell
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
troubled
with
no
misgiving
that
it
be
young
in
me
to
respond
to
her
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
laugh
and
cry
in
all
my
life
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
---
not
even
to
her
---
more
freely
than
I
do
that
morning
.
   
<EOS>
"
Barkis
will
be
so
glad
,
"
say
Peggotty
,
wipe
her
eye
with
her
apron
,
"
that
it
will
do
him
more
good
than
pint
of
liniment
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
go
and
tell
him
you
be
here
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
come
up
and
see
him
,
my
dear
?
"
   
<EOS>
of
course
I
would
.
 
<EOS>
but
Peggotty
could
not
get
out
of
the
room
as
easily
as
she
mean
to
,
for
as
often
as
she
get
to
the
door
and
look
round
at
me
<EOS>
,
she
come
back
again
to
have
another
laugh
and
another
cry
upon
my
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
to
make
the
matter
easy
,
I
go
upstairs
with
her
;
and
have
wait
outside
for
a
minute
,
while
she
say
a
word
of
preparation
to
Mr
Barkis
,
present
myself
before
that
invalid
.
   
<EOS>
He
receive
me
with
absolute
enthusiasm
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
too
rheumatic
to
be
shake
hand
with
,
but
he
beg
me
to
shake
the
tassel
on
the
top
of
his
nightcap
,
which
I
do
most
cordially
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
sit
down
by
the
side
of
the
bed
,
he
say
that
it
do
him
a
world
of
good
to
feel
as
if
he
be
drive
me
on
the
Blunderstone
road
again
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
lie
in
bed
,
face
upward
,
and
so
cover
,
with
that
exception
,
that
he
seem
to
be
nothing
but
a
face
---
like
a
conventional
cherubim
<EOS>
---
he
look
the
queer
object
I
ever
beheld
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
name
be
it
,
as
I
write
up
in
the
cart
,
sir
?
"
say
Mr
Barkis
,
with
a
slow
rheumatic
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
Mr
Barkis
,
we
have
some
grave
talk
about
that
matter
,
have
not
we
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
willin
'
a
long
time
,

Mr
Barkis
.
   
<EOS>
"
a
long
time

"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
regret
it
,
"
say
Mr
Barkis
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
remember
what
you
tell
me
once
,
about

"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
very
well

"
I
return
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be

true

Mr
Barkis
,
"
as

<EOS>
It

as
true

"
say
Mr
Barkis
,
nod
his
nightcap
,
which
be
his
only
mean
of
emphasis
,
"
as
taxis
be
.
 
<EOS>
and
nothing
be
true
than
them
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Barkis
turn
his
eye
upon
me
,
as
if
for
my
assent
to
this
result
of
his
reflection
in
bed
;
and
I
give
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
nothing
be
true
than
them
,
"
repeat
Mr
Barkis
;
"
a
man
as
poor
as
I
be
,
find
that
out
in
his
mind
when
he
be
lay
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
very
poor
man
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
to
hear
it
,
Mr
Barkis
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
a
very
poor
man
,
indeed
I
be
,
"
say
Mr
Barkis
.
   
<EOS>
here
his
right
hand
come
slowly
and
feebly
from
under
the
bedclothe
,
and
with
a
purposeless
uncertain
grasp
take
hold
of
a
stick
which
be
loosely
tie
to
the
side
of
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
after
some
poke
about
with
this
instrument
,
in
the
course
of
which
his
face
assume
a
variety
of
distracted
expression
,
Mr
Barkis
poke
it
against
a
box
,
an
end
of
which
have
be
visible
to
me
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
then
his
face
become
compose
.
   
<EOS>
"
old
clothe
,
"
say
Mr
Barkis
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
it
be
money
,
sir
,
"
say
Mr
Barkis
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
it
be
,
indeed
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
but
it
ain't
,
"
say
Mr
Barkis
,
open
both
his
eye
as
wide
as
he
possibly
could
.
   
<EOS>
I
express
myself
quite
sure
of
that
,
and
Mr
Barkis
,
turn
his
eye
more
gently
to
his
wife
,
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
She
be
the
usefullest
and
good
of
woman
,
C*P
Barkis
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
praise
that
anyone
can
give
to
C*P
Barkis
,
she
deserve
,
and
more
!
<EOS>
My
dear
,
you
will
get
a
dinner
today
,
for
company
;
something
good
to
eat
and
drink
<EOS>
,
will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
should
have
protest
against
this
unnecessary
demonstration
in
my
honour
,
but
that
I
see
Peggotty
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
bed
,
extremely
anxious
I
should
not
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
hold
my
peace
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
get
a
trifle
of
money
somewhere
about
me
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Mr
Barkis
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
be
a
little
tired
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
and
Mr
David
will
leave
me
for
a
short
nap
,
I
will
try
and
find
it
when
I
wake
.
"
   
<EOS>
We
leave
the
room
,
in
compliance
with
this
request
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
get
outside
the
door
,
Peggotty
inform
me
that
Mr
Barkis
,
be
now
"
a
little
near
"
than
he
use
to
be
<EOS>
,
always
resorted
to
this
same
device
before
produce
a
single
coin
from
his
store
;
and
that
he
endure
unheard
-
of
agony
in
crawl
out
of
bed
alone
,
and
take
it
from
that
unlucky
box
.
 
<EOS>
in
effect
,
we
presently
hear
him
utter
suppress
groan
of
the
most
dismal
nature
,
as
this
magpie
proceeding
rack
him
in
every
joint
;
but
while
Peggotty
's
eye
be
full
of
compassion
for
him
,
she
say
his
generous
impulse
would
do
him
good
,
and
it
be
well
not
to
check
it
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
groan
on
,
until
he
have
get
into
bed
again
,
suffer
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
a
martyrdom
;
and
then
call
us
in
,
pretend
to
have
just
wake
up
from
a
refreshing
sleep
,
and
to
produce
a
guinea
from
under
his
pillow
.
 
<EOS>
His
satisfaction
in
which
happy
imposition
on
us
,
and
in
have
preserve
the
impenetrable
secret
of
the
box
,
appear
to
be
a
sufficient
compensation
to
him
for
all
his
torture
.
   
<EOS>
I
prepare
Peggotty
for
Steerforth
's
arrival
and
<EOS>
it
be
not
long
before
he
come
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
persuade
<EOS>
she
know
no
difference
between
his
have
be
a
personal
benefactor
of
hers
,
and
a
kind
friend
to
me
,
and
that
she
would
have
receive
him
with
the
utmost
gratitude
and
devotion
in
any
case
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
easy
,
spirit
good
humour
;
his
genial
manner
,
his
handsome
look
,
his
natural
gift
of
adapt
himself
to
whomsoever
he
please
,
and
make
direct
,
when
he
care
to
do
it
,
to
the
main
point
of
interest
in
anybody
's
heart
;
<EOS>
bind
her
to
him
wholly
in
five
minute
.
 
<EOS>
His
manner
to
me
,
alone
,
would
have
win
her
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
through
all
these
cause
combine
,
I
sincerely
believe
she
have
a
kind
of
adoration
for
him
before
he
leave
the
house
that
night
.
   
<EOS>
He
stay
there
with
me
to
dinner
---
if
I
be
to
say
willingly
,
I
should
not
half
express
how
readily
and
gaily
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
into
Mr
Barkis
's
room
like
light
and
air
,
brightening
and
refresh
it
as
if
he
be
healthy
weather
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
noise
,
no
effort
,
no
consciousness
,
in
anything
he
do
;
but
in
everything
an
indescribable
lightness
,
a
seeming
impossibility
of
do
anything
else
,
or
do
anything
well
,
which
be
so
graceful
,
so
natural
,
and
agreeable
,
that
it
overcome
me
,
even
now
,
in
the
remembrance
.
   
<EOS>
We
make
merry
in
the
little
parlour
,
where
the
Book
of
Martyrs
,
unthumbed
since
my
time
,
be
lay
out
upon
the
desk
as
of
old
,
and
where
I
now
turn
over
its
terrific
picture
,
remember
the
old
sensation
they
have
awaken
,
but
not
feel
them
.
 
<EOS>
when
Peggotty
speak
of
what
she
call
my
room
,
and
of
its
be
ready
for
me
at
night
,
and
of
her
hope
I
would
occupy
it
,
before
I
could
so
much
as
look
at
Steerforth
,
hesitating
,
he
be
possess
of
the
whole
case
.
   
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
sleep
here
,
while
we
stay
,
and
I
shall
sleep
at
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
but
to
bring
you
so
far
,
"
I
return
,
"
and
to
separate
,
seem
bad
companionship
,
Steerforth
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
in
the
name
of
Heaven
,
where
do
you
naturally
belong
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
"
seem
"
,
compare
to
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
settle
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
He
maintain
all
his
delightful
quality
to
the
last
,
until
we
start
forth
,
at
eight
o'clock
,
for
Mr
Peggotty
's
boat
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
they
be
more
and
more
brightly
exhibit
as
the
hour
go
on
;
for
I
think
even
then
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
now
,
that
the
consciousness
of
success
in
his
determination
to
please
,
inspire
him
with
a
new
delicacy
of
perception
,
and
make
it
,
subtle
as
it
be
,
more
easy
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
if
anyone
have
tell
me
,
then
,
that
all
this
be
a
brilliant
game
,
play
for
the
excitement
of
the
moment
,
for
the
employment
of
high
spirit
,
in
the
thoughtless
love
of
superiority
,
in
a
mere
wasteful
careless
course
of
win
what
be
worthless
to
him
,
and
next
minute
throw
away
---
I
say
,
if
anyone
have
tell
me
such
a
lie
that
night
,
I
wonder
in
what
manner
of
receive
it
my
indignation
would
have
find
a
vent
!
 
<EOS>
probably
only
in
an
increase
,
have
that
be
possible
,
of
the
romantic
feeling
of
fidelity
and
friendship
with
which
I
walk
beside
him
,
over
the
dark
wintry
sand
towards
the
old
boat
;
the
wind
sigh
around
us
even
more
mournfully
,
than
it
have
sigh
and
moan
upon
the
night
when
I
first
darken
Mr
Peggotty
's
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
wild
kind
of
place
,
Steerforth
,
be
it
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
dismal
enough
in
the
dark
,
"
he
say
:
"
and
the
sea
roar
as
if
it
be
hungry
for
us
.
 
<EOS>
be
that
the
boat
,
where
I
see
a
light
yonder
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
boat
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
it
be
the
same
I
see
this
morning
,
"
he
return
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
come
straight
to
it
,
by
instinct
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
We
say
no
more
as
we
approach
the
light
,
but
make
softly
for
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
I
lay
my
hand
upon
the
latch
;
and
whisper
Steerforth
to
keep
close
to
me
,
go
in
.
   
<EOS>
a
murmur
of
voice
have
be
audible
on
the
outside
,
and
,
at
the
moment
of
our
entrance
,
a
clapping
of
hand
:
which
latter
noise
,
I
be
surprised
to
see
,
proceed
from
the
generally
disconsolate
Mrs
Gummidge
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mrs
Gummidge
be
not
the
only
person
there
who

<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
,
his

light
up
with
uncommon
satisfaction
,
and
laugh
with
all
his
might

hold
his
rough
arm
wide
open
,
as
if
for
little
em'ly
to
run
into
them
;
<EOS>
Ham
,
with
a
mixed
expression
in
his
face
of
admiration
,
exultation

and
a
lumbering
sort
of
bashfulness
that
sit
upon
him
very
well
,
hold
little
em'ly
by
the
hand
,
as

be
stop
by

in
the
very
act
of
spring
from
Ham
to
nestle
in
Mr
Peggotty
's
embrace
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
first
glimpse
we
have
of
them
all
,
and
at
the
moment
of
our
passing
from
the
dark
cold
night
into
the
warm
light
room
,

be
the
way
in
which
they

<EOS>
Mrs

that
one
may
have
doubt
whether

<EOS>
I
be
in
the

when
Ham

:
   
"

<EOS>
It

"
   
<EOS>
in
a
moment
we
be

shake
hand
with
one
another

and
ask
one
another
how
we
do
,
and
tell
one
another
how
glad

and
all

<EOS>
Mr

and
over
again
shake
hand
with
me
,
and
then
with
Steerforth
,
and
then
with
me
,
and
then
ruffle
his
shaggy
hair
all
over
his
head
,
and
laugh
with
such
glee
and
triumph
,
that
it
be
a
treat
to
see

<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
ruffle
his
hair
again
,
with
both
hand
,
as
a
further
preparation
for
what
he
be
go
to
say
,
and
go
on
,
with
a
hand
upon
each
of
his
knee
:

something

"
   
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
never
see
Ham
grin
to
anything
like
the
extent
to
which
he
sit
grin
at

<EOS>
"

Mr

with
his

one
high
noon
of

but
he
lose
that

<EOS>
He
foller

he
make
it
clear

wot
's
amiss

now
I
could

I

at

have
a

<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
long
I
may
live

or
how
soon

I
know
that
if
I
be
capsize

any
night

in

gale
of
wind
in
Yarmouth
Roads
here

and
be
to

light
shine
for
the
last

over

I

I

<EOS>
Mr

,
in
simple
earnestness
,
wave
his
right
arm
,
as
if
he
be
wave
it
at
the
town
-
light
for
the
last
time
,
and
then
,
exchange
a
nod
with
Ham
,
whose
eye
he
catch
,
proceed
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well

<EOS>
I
counsel
him
to
speak
to
Em'ly

<EOS>
He
be
big
enough
,

he
be
bashfuller

he
do
not

I
speak

Him

I
give
her
a

I

no

to
her
than
,
"
My

you
be
right

out

I
away

I

I

a

shaking
of
my
hand
,
"
I
will

Mr

have
vary
in
its
expression
with
the
various
stage
of
his
narrative
,
now
resume
all
its
former
triumphant
delight
,
as
he
lay
a
hand
upon
my
knee
and
a
hand
upon
Steerforth
's
(
previously
wet
them
both
,
for
the
great
emphasis
of
the
action

,
and
divide
the
follow
speech
between

:
   
<EOS>
"
all

one
evening

him
with
her

<EOS>
there
be
not
so
much
in

,
you
will
say

<EOS>
no
,
because
he
take
care
on

like
a

arter
dark

indeed
afore
dark

and
at
all

<EOS>
but
this
tarpaulin

he
take
hold

he
cry
out

joyful
,
"

and
she
say

half
bold

half
shy

and
half
a
laughing

half
a
crying

an
ecstasy

she
clap
her

you
come
in

Theer

<EOS>
Ham
stagger
,
as
well
he
may
,
under
the
blow
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
deal
him
in
his
unbounded
joy
,
as
a
mark
of
confidence
and
friendship
;
but
feeling
call
upon
to
say
something
to
us
,
he
say
,
with
much
faltering
and
great
difficulty
:
   
"
She
warn't

no
high

you

Mas'r
Davy

when
you
first
come

I
think
what
she

grow
up
to
be

<EOS>
I
see
her
grow
up

gent'lmen

like
a

<EOS>
I
would
lay
down
my
life
for
her

<EOS>
Mas'r
Davy

<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
most
content

cheerful

<EOS>
She
be
more

"
   
<EOS>
I
think
it
affect
to
see
such
a
sturdy
fellow

Ham
be
now

tremble
in
the
strength
of
what
he
feel

the
pretty

have
win
his

by
the
recollection
of
my
childhood
,
I
do
not
know
.
 
<EOS>
whether
I
have
come
there
with
any
linger
fancy
that
I
be
still
to
love
little
em'ly
,
I
do
not
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
I
be
fill
with
pleasure
by
all
this
;
but
,
at
first
,
with
an
indescribably
sensitive
pleasure
,
that
a
very
little
would
have
change
to
pain
.
   
<EOS>
therefore
,
if
it
have
depend
upon
me
to
touch
the
prevail
chord
among
them
with
any
skill
,
I
should
have
make
a
poor
hand
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
it
depend
upon
Steerforth
;
and
he
do
it
with
such
address
,
that
in
a
few
minute
we
be
all
as
easy
and
as
happy
as
it
be
possible
to
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
he
say
,
"
you
be
a
thoroughly
good
fellow
,
and
deserve
to
be
as
happy
as
you
be
tonight
.
 
<EOS>
My
hand
upon
it
!
 
<EOS>
Ham
,
I
give
you
joy
,
my
boy
.
 
<EOS>
My
hand
upon
that
,
too
!
 
<EOS>
Daisy
,
stir
the
fire
,
and
make
it
a
brisk
one
!
<EOS>
and
Mr
Peggotty
,
unless
you
can
induce
your
gentle
niece
to
come
back
(
for
whom
I
vacate
this
seat
in
the
corner
)
,
I
shall
go
.
 
<EOS>
any
gap
at
your
fireside
on
such
a
night
---
such
a
gap
least
of
all
---
I
would
not
make
,
for
the
wealth
of
the
Indies
!
"
   
<EOS>
so
Mr
Peggotty
go
into
my
old
room
to
fetch
little
em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
little
Em'ly
do
not
like
to
come
,
and
then
Ham
go
.
<EOS>
presently
they
bring
her
to
the
fireside
,
very
much
confused
,
and
very
shy
,
---
but
she
soon
become
more
assured
when
she
find
how
gently
and
respectfully
Steerforth
speak
to
her
;
how
skilfully
he
avoid
anything
that
would
embarrass
her
<EOS>
;
how
he
talk
to
Mr
Peggotty
of
boat
,
and
ship
,
and
tide
,
and
fish
;
how
he
refer
to
me
about
the
time
when
he
have
see
Mr
Peggotty
at
Salem
House
;
how
delighted
he
be
with
the
boat
and
all
belong
to
it
;
how
lightly
and
easily
he
carry
on
,
until
he
bring
us
,
by
degree
,
into
a
charm
circle
,
and
we
be
all
talk
away
without
any
reserve
.
   
<EOS>
em'ly
,
indeed
,
say
little
all
the
evening
;
but
she
look
,
and
listen
,
and
her
face
get
animate
,
and
she
be
charm
.
<EOS>
Steerforth
tell
a
story
of
a
dismal
shipwreck
(
which
arise
out
of
his
talk
with
Mr
Peggotty
)
,
as
if
he
see
it
all
before
him
---
and
little
Em'ly
's
eye
be
fasten
on
him
all
the
time
,
as
if
she
see
it
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
us
a
merry
adventure
of
his
own
,
as
a
relief
to
that
,
with
as
much
gaiety
as
if
the
narrative
be
as
fresh
to
him
as
it
be
to
us
---
and
little
Em'ly
laugh
until
the
boat
ring
with
the
musical
sound
,
and
we
all
laugh
(
steerforth
too
)
,
in
irresistible
sympathy
with
what
be
so
pleasant
and
light
-
hearted
.
<EOS>
He
get
Mr
Peggotty
to
sing
,
or
rather
to
roar
,
"
when
the
stormy
wind
do
blow
,
do
blow
,
do
blow
"
;
and
he
sing
a
sailor
's
song
himself
,
so
pathetically
and
beautifully
,
that
I
could
have
almost
fancy
that
the
real
wind
creep
sorrowfully
round
the
house
,
and
murmur
low
through
our
unbroken
silence
,
be
there
to
listen
.
   
<EOS>
as
to
Mrs
Gummidge
,
he
rouse
that
victim
of
despondency
with
a
success
never
attain
by
anyone
else
(
so
Mr
Peggotty
inform
me
)
,
since
the
decease
of
the
old
one
.
 
<EOS>
He
leave
her
so
little
leisure
for
be
miserable
,
that
she
say
next
day
she
think
she
must
have
be
bewitch
.
   
<EOS>
but
he
set
up
no
monopoly
of
the
general
attention
,
or
the
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
when
little
Em'ly
grow
more
courageous
,
and
talk
(
but
still
bashfully
)
across
the
fire
to
me
,
of
our
old
wandering
upon
the
beach
,
to
pick
up
shell
and
pebble
;
and
when
I
ask
her
if
she
recollect
how
I
use
to
be
devoted
to
her
;
and
when
we
both
laugh
and
redden
,
cast
these
look
back
on
the
pleasant
old
time
,
so
unreal
to
look
at
now
;
he
be
silent
and
attentive
,
and
observe
us
thoughtfully
.
 
<EOS>
She
sit
,
at
this
time
,
and
all
the
evening
,
on
the
old
locker
in
her
old
little
corner
by
the
fire
---
<EOS>
ham
beside
her
,
where
I
use
to
sit
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
satisfy
myself
whether
it
be
in
her
own
little
tormenting
way
,
or
in
a
maidenly
reserve
before
us
,
that
she
keep
quite
close
to
the
wall
,
and
away
from
him
;
but
I
observe
that
she
do
so
,
all
the
evening
.
   
<EOS>
as
I
remember
,
it
be
almost
midnight
when
we
take
our
leave
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
have
some
biscuit
and
dry
fish
for
supper
,
and
Steerforth
have
produce
from
his
pocket
a
full
flask
of
holland
,
which
we
man
(
I
may
say
we
man
,
now
,
without
a
blush
)
have
empty
.
 
<EOS>
We
part
merrily
;
and
as
they
all
stand
crowded
round
the
door
to
light
us
as
far
as
they
could
upon
our
road
,
I
see
the
sweet
blue
eye
of
little
Em'ly
peep
after
us
,
from
behind
Ham
,
and
hear
her
soft
voice
call
to
us
to
be
careful
how
we
go
.
   
<EOS>
"
a
most
engaging
little
Beauty
!
<EOS>
"
say
Steerforth
,
take
my
arm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
quaint
place
,
and
they
be
quaint
company
,
and
it
be
quite
a
new
sensation
to
mix
with
them
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
how
fortunate
we
be
,
too
,
"
I
return
,
"
to
have
arrive
to
witness
their
happiness
in
that
intend
marriage
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
people
so
happy
.
 
<EOS>
how
delightful
to
see
it
,
and
to
be
make
the
sharer
in
their
honest
joy
,
as
we
have
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
rather
a
chuckle
-
head
fellow
for
the
girl
;
be
not
he
?
"
say
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
be
so
hearty
with
him
,
and
with
them
all
,
that
I
feel
a
shock
in
this
unexpected
and
cold
reply
.
 
<EOS>
but
turn
quickly
upon
him
,
and
see
a
laugh
in
his
eye
,
I
answer
,
much
relieved
:
   
<EOS>
"
ah
,
Steerforth
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
well
for
you
to
joke
about
the
poor
!
 
<EOS>
You
may
skirmish
with
Miss
Dartle
,
or
try
to
hide
your
sympathy
in
jest
from
me
,
but
I
know
better
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
see
how
perfectly
you
understand
them
,
how
exquisitely
you
can
enter
into
happiness
like
this
plain
fisherman
's
,
or
humour
a
love
like
my
old
nurse
's
,
<EOS>
I
know
that
there
be
not
a
joy
or
sorrow
,
not
an
emotion
,
of
such
people
,
that
can
be
indifferent
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
admire
and
love
you
for
it
,
Steerforth
,
twenty
time
the
more
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
stop
,
and
,
look
in
my
face
,
say
,
"
Daisy
,
I
believe
you
be
in
earnest
,
and
be
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
we
all
be
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
next
moment
he
be
gaily
singe
Mr
Peggotty
's
song
,
as
we
walk
at
a
round
pace
back
to
Yarmouth
.
      
<EOS>
Chapter
22
.
<EOS>
some
old
scene
,
and
some
new
people
 
steerforth
and
I
stay
for
more
than
a
fortnight
in
that
part
of
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
very
much
together
,
I
need
not
say
;
but
occasionally
we
be
asunder
for
some
hour
at
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
good
sailor
,
and
I
be
but
an
indifferent
one
;
and
when
he
go
out
boat
with
Mr
Peggotty
,
which
be
a
favourite
amusement
of
his
,
I
generally
remain
ashore
.
 
<EOS>
My
occupation
of
Peggotty
's
spare
-
room
put
a
constraint
upon
me
,
from
which
he
be
free
:
for
,
know
how
assiduously
she
attend
on
Mr
Barkis
all
day
,
I
do
not
like
to
remain
out
late
at
night
;
whereas
Steerforth
,
lie
at
the
Inn
,
have
nothing
to
consult
but
his
own
humour
.
 
<EOS>
thus
it
come
about
,
that
I
hear
of
his
make
little
treat
for
the
fisherman
at
Mr
Peggotty
's
house
of
call
,
"
the
Willing
Mind
"
,
after
I
be
in
bed
,
and
of
his
be
afloat
,
wrap
in
fisherman
's
clothe
,
whole
moonlight
night
,
and
come
back
when
the
morning
tide
be
at
flood
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
however
,
I
know
that
his
restless
nature
and
bold
spirit
delight
to
find
a
vent
in
rough
toil
and
hard
weather
,
as
in
any
other
mean
of
excitement
that
present
itself
freshly
to
him
;
so
none
of
his
proceeding
surprise
me
.
   
<EOS>
another
cause
of
our
be
sometimes
apart
,
be
,
that
I
have
naturally
an
interest
in
go
over
to
Blunderstone
,
and
revisit
the
old
familiar
scene
of
my
childhood
;
while
Steerforth
,
after
be
there
once
,
have
naturally
no
great
interest
in
go
there
again
.
 
<EOS>
hence
,
on
three
or
four
day
that
I
can
at
once
recall
,
we
go
our
several
way
after
an
early
breakfast
,
and
meet
again
at
a
late
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
idea
how
he
employ
his
time
in
the
interval
,
beyond
a
general
knowledge
that
he
be
very
popular
in
the
place
,
and
have
twenty
mean
of
actively
divert
himself
where
another
man
may
not
have
find
one
.
   
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
my
occupation
in
my
solitary
pilgrimage
be
to
recall
every
yard
of
the
old
road
as
I
go
along
it
,
and
to
haunt
the
old
spot
,
of
which
I
never
tired
.
 
<EOS>
I
haunt
them
,
as
my
memory
have
often
do
,
and
linger
among
them
as
my
young
thought
have
linger
when
I
be
far
away
.
 
<EOS>
the
grave
beneath
the
tree
,
where
both
my
parent
lay
---
on
which
I
have
look
out
,
when
it
be
my
father
's
only
,
with
such
curious
feeling
of
compassion
,
and
by
which
I
have
stand
,
so
desolate
,
when
it
be
open
to
receive
my
pretty
mother
and
her
baby
---
the
grave
which
Peggotty
's
own
faithful
care
have
ever
since
keep
neat
,
and
make
a
garden
of
<EOS>
,
I
walk
near
,
by
the
hour
.
 
<EOS>
It
lie
a
little
off
the
churchyard
path
,
in
a
quiet
corner
,
not
so
far
removed
<EOS>
but
I
could
read
the
name
upon
the
stone
as
I
walk
to
and
fro
,
startle
by
the
sound
of
the
church
-
bell
when
it
strike
the
hour
,
for
it
be
like
a
depart
voice
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
reflection
at
these
time
be
always
associate
with
the
figure
I
be
to
make
in
life
,
and
the
distinguished
thing
I
be
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
My
echoing
footstep
go
to
no
other
tune
,
but
be
as
constant
to
that
as
if
I
have
come
home
to
build
my
castle
in
the
air
at
a
live
mother
's
side
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
great
change
in
my
old
home
.
 
<EOS>
the
ragged
nest
,
so
long
desert
by
the
rook
,
be
go
;
and
the
tree
be
lop
and
top
out
of
their
remember
shape
.
 
<EOS>
the
garden
have
run
wild
,
and
half
the
window
of
the
house
be
shut
up
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
occupy
,
but
only
by
a
poor
lunatic
gentleman
,
and
the
people
who
take
care
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
always
sit
at
my
little
window
,
look
out
into
the
churchyard
;
and
I
wonder
whether
his
rambling
thought
ever
go
upon
any
of
the
fancy
that
use
to
occupy
mine
,
on
the
rosy
morning
when
I
peep
out
of
that
same
little
window
in
my
night
-
clothe
,
and
see
the
sheep
quietly
feed
in
the
light
of
the
rise
sun
.
   
<EOS>
Our
old
neighbour
,
Mr
and
Mrs
Grayper
,
be
go
to
South
America
,
and
the
rain
have
make
its
way
through
the
roof
of
their
empty
house
,
and
stain
the
outer
wall
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chillip
be
marry
again
to
a
tall
,
raw
-
boned
,
high
-
nosed
wife
;
and
they
have
a
weazen
little
baby
,
with
a
heavy
head
that
it
could
not
hold
up
,
and
two
weak
stare
eye
,
with
which
it
seem
to
be
always
wonder
why
it
have
ever
be
bear
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
with
a
singular
jumble
of
sadness
and
pleasure
that
I
use
to
linger
about
my
native
place
,
until
the
redden
winter
sun
admonish
me
that
it
be
time
to
start
on
my
return
walk
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
when
the
place
be
leave
behind
,
and
especially
when
Steerforth
and
I
be
happily
seat
over
our
dinner
by
a
blaze
fire
,
it
be
delicious
to
think
of
have
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
so
it
be
,
though
in
a
soften
degree
,
when
I
go
to
my
neat
room
at
night
;
and
,
turn
over
the
leave
of
the
crocodile
-
book
(
which
be
always
there
,
upon
a
little
table
)
<EOS>
,
remember
with
a
grateful
heart
how
blest
I
be
in
have
such
a
friend
as
Steerforth
,
such
a
friend
as
Peggotty
,
and
such
a
substitute
for
what
I
have
lose
as
my
excellent
and
generous
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
my
near
way
to
Yarmouth
,
in
come
back
from
these
long
walk
,
be
by
a
ferry
.
 
<EOS>
It
land
me
on
the
flat
between
the
town
and
the
sea
,
which
I
could
make
straight
across
,
and
so
save
myself
a
considerable
circuit
by
the
high
road
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
's
house
be
on
that
waste
-
place
,
and
not
a
hundred
yard
out
of
my
track
,
I
always
look
in
as
I
go
by
.
 
<EOS>
Steerforth
be
pretty
sure
to
be
there
expect
me
,
and
we
go
on
together
through
the
frosty
air
and
gather
fog
towards
the
twinkle
light
of
the
town
.
   
<EOS>
one
dark
evening
,
when
I

that
day

my
parting
visit
to
Blunderstone

be
now
about
to
return
home
---
I
find
him
alone
in
Mr
Peggotty

house
,
sit
thoughtfully
before
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
so
intent
upon
his
own
reflection
that
he
be
quite
unconscious
of
my
approach
.
<EOS>
this
,
indeed
,
he
may
easily
have
be
if
he
have
be
less
absorb
,
for
footstep
fall
noiselessly
on
the
sandy
ground
outside
;
but
even
my
entrance
fail
to
rouse
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
stand
close
to
him
,
look
at
him
;
and
still
,
with
a
heavy
brow
,
he
be
lose
in
his
meditation
.
   
<EOS>
He
give
such
a
start
when
I
put
my
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
that
he
make
me
start
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
come
upon
me
,
"
he
say
,
almost
angrily
,
"
like
a
reproachful
ghost
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
oblige
to
announce
myself
,
somehow
,
"
I
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
I
call
you
down
from
the
star
?

"
   
<EOS>
"

.
 
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
up
from
anywhere
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
say
I
,
take
my
seat
near
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
look
at
the
picture
in
the
fire
,
"
he
return
.
   
<EOS>
"
but
you
be
spoil
them
for
me
,
"
say
I
,
as
he
stir
it
quickly
with
a
piece
of
burn
wood
,
strike
out
of
it
a
train
of
red
-
hot
spark
that
go
career
up
the
little
chimney
,
and
roar
out
into
the
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
would
not
have
see
them
,
"
he
return
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
detest
this
mongrel
time
,
neither
day
nor
night

<EOS>
how
late
you
be
!
 
<EOS>
where
have

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
take
leave
of

I.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>

I
have
be

here

Steerforth
,
glance
round
the
room
,

<EOS>
"
I
wish
with
all
my

I
could
guide
myself
better

"
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
passionate
dejection
in
his
manner
that
quite
amaze
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
more
unlike
himself
than
I
could
have
suppose
possible

It
would
be
well
to

poor

,
get
up
and
lean
moodily
against
the
chimney

piece
,
with
his
face
towards
the
fire
,

than
to

myself

twenty
time
rich

the
torment
to
myself

Devil

bark

within
the
last
half

hour

"
   
<EOS>
I
be
so
confound
by
the
alteration
in
him
,
that
at
first
I
could
only
observe
him
in
silence
,
as
he
stand
lean
his
head
upon
his
hand
,
and
look
gloomily
down
at
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
I
beg
him
,
with
all
the
earnestness
I
feel
,
to
tell
me
what
have
occur
to
cross
him
so
unusually
,
and
to
let
me
sympathize
with
him
,
if
I
could
not
hope
to
advise
him
.
 
<EOS>
before
I
have
well
conclude
,
he
begin
to
laugh

fretfully
at
first
,

soon
with
return
gaiety

I
never

express
such
a

exchange
a
few
word
,
she
do
not
like
to
replace
that
hand
,
but
,
still
appear
timid
and
constrain
,
walk
by
herself
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
all
this
very
pretty
and
engaging
,
and
Steerforth
seem
to
think
so
too
,
as
we
look
after
them
fade
away
in
the
light
of
a
young
moon
.
   
<EOS>
suddenly
there
pass
us
---
evidently
follow
them
---
a
young
woman
whose
approach
we
have
not
observe
,
but
whose
face
I
see
as
she
go
by
,
and
think
I
have
a
faint
remembrance
of
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
lightly
dress
;
look
bold
,
and
haggard
,
and
flaunting
,
and
poor
;
but
seem
,
for
the
time
,
to
have
give
all
that
to
the
wind
which
be
blow
,
and
to
have
nothing
in
her
mind
but
go
after
them
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
dark
distant
level
,
absorb
their
figure
into
itself
,
leave
but
itself
visible
between
us
and
the
sea
and
cloud
,
her
figure
disappear
in
like
manner
,
still
no
nearer
to
them
than
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
black
shadow
to
be
follow
the
girl
,
"
say
Steerforth
,
stand
still
;
"
what
do
it
mean
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
speak
in
a
low
voice
that
sound
almost
strange
to
Me
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
must
have
it
in
her
mind
to
beg
of
them
,
I
think
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
a
beggar
would
be
no
novelty
,
"
say
Steerforth
;
"
but
it
be
a
strange
thing
that
the
beggar
should
take
that
shape
tonight
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
for
no
well
reason
,
truly
,
than
because
I
be
think
,
"
he
say
,
after
a
pause
,
"
of
something
like
it
,
when
it
come
by
.
 
<EOS>
where
the
Devil
do
it
come
from
,
I
wonder
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
from
the
shadow
of
this
wall
,
I
think
,
"
say
I
,
as
we
emerge
upon
a
road
on
which
a
wall
abut
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
go
!
"
<EOS>
he
return
,
look
over
his
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
all
ill
go
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
now
for
our
dinner
!
"
   
<EOS>
but
he
look
again
over
his
shoulder
towards
the
sea
-
line
glimmering
afar
off
,
and
yet
again
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
wonder
about
it
,
in
some
broken
expression
,
several
time
,
in
the
short
remainder
of
our
walk
;
and
only
seem
to
forget
it
when
the
light
of
fire
and
candle
shone
upon
us
,
seat
warm
and
merry
,
at
table
.
   
<EOS>
Littimer
be
there
,
and
have
his
usual
effect
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
say
to
him
that
I
hope
Mrs
Steerforth
and
Miss
Dartle
be
well
,
he
answer
respectfully
(
and
of
course
respectably
)
,
that
they
be
tolerably
well
,
he
thank
me
,
and
have
send
their
compliment
.
<EOS>
this
be
all
,
and
yet
he
seem
to
me
to
say
as
plainly
as
a
man
could
say
:
"
You
be
very
young
,
sir
;
you
be
exceedingly
young
.
"
   
<EOS>
We
have
almost
finish
dinner
,
when
take
a
step
or
two
towards
the
table
,
from
the
corner
where
he
keep
watch
upon
us
,
or
rather
upon
me
,
as
I
feel
,
he
say
to
his
master
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mowcher
be
down
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
who
?
"
cry
Steerforth
,
much
astonished
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Mowcher
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
what
on
earth
do
she
do
here
?
"
say
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
appear
to
be
her
native
part
of
the
country
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
She
inform
me
that
she
make
one
of
her
professional
visit
here
,
every
year
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
meet
her
in
the
street
this
afternoon
,
and
she
wish
to
know
if
she
may
have
the
honour
of
wait
on
you
after
dinner
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
the
Giantess
in
question
,
Daisy
?
"
inquire
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
confess
<EOS>
---
I
feel
ashamed
,
even
of
be
at
this
disadvantage
before
Littimer
---
that
Miss
Mowcher
and
I
be
wholly
unacquainted
.
   
<EOS>
"
then
you
shall
know
her
,
"
say
Steerforth
,
"
<EOS>
for
she
be
one
of
the
seven
wonder
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
when
Miss
Mowcher
come
,
show
her
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
feel
some
curiosity
and
excitement
about
this
lady
,
especially
as
Steerforth
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughing
when
I
refer
to
her
,
and
positively
refuse
to
answer
any
question
of
which
I
make
her
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
remain
,
therefore
,
in
a
state
of
considerable
expectation
until
the
cloth
have
be
remove
some
half
an
hour
,
and
we
be
sit
over
our
decanter
of
wine
before
the
fire
,
when
the
door
open
,
and
Littimer
,
with
his
habitual
serenity
quite
undisturbed
,
announce
:
   
"
Miss
Mowcher
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
look
at
the
doorway
and
see
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
still
look
at
the
doorway
,
think
that
Miss
Mowcher
be
a
long
while
make
her
appearance
,
when
,
to
my
infinite
astonishment
,
there
come
waddle
round
a
sofa
which
stand
between
me
and
it
,
a
pursy
dwarf
,
of
about
forty

forty

five

with
a
very
large
head
and
face
,
a
pair
of
roguish
grey
eye
,
and
such
extremely
little
arm
,
that
,
to
enable
herself
to
lay
a
finger
archly
against
her
snub
nose
,
as
she
ogle
Steerforth
,
she
be
oblige
to
meet
the
finger
half

way
,
and
lie
her
nose
against
it

<EOS>
Her
chin
,
which
be
what
be
call
a
double

be
so
fat

Throat

so
short

at

sound

put

She
seem

find
no

the
little

at

with
the
aspect

a

bit
more
eyebrow

"
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
blush
as
I
decline
,
for
I
feel
we
be
on
my
weak
point
,
now
.
 
<EOS>
but
Miss
Mowcher
,
find
that
I
be
not
at
present
disposed
for
any
decoration
within
the
range
of
her
art
,
and
that
I
be
,
for
the
time
being
,
proof
against
the
blandishment
of
the
small
bottle
which
she
hold
up
before
one
eye
to
enforce
her
persuasion
,
<EOS>
say
we
would
make
a
beginning
on
an
early
day
,
and
request
the
aid
of
my
hand
to
descend
from
her
elevated
station
.
<EOS>
thus
assist
,
she
skip
down
with
much
agility
,
and
begin
to
tie
her
double
chin
into
her
bonnet

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
reply
politely
:
"
not
at
all

"
 
<EOS>
but
I
think
she
be
rather
so
,
when
she
toss
up
his
two
half
-
crown
like
a
goblin
pieman
,
catch
them
,
drop
them
in

pocket

a
loud
slap

<EOS>
"
that

Till

<EOS>
observe
Miss
Mowcher
,
stand
at
the
chair
again
,
and
replace
in
the
bag
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
little
object
she

empty
out

it

<EOS>
"
have
I

<EOS>
It

so

<EOS>
It
will
not

Ned

when
they
take
him

him

as
the
Englishman
say
for

learn
French

it
so
like
English

<EOS>
with
the
bag
sling
over
her
arm
,
and
rattle
as
she
waddle
away
,
she
waddle
to
the
door
,
where
she
stop
to
inquire
if
she
should
leave
us
a
lock
of
her
hair
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
not
I
volatile
?
"
<EOS>
she
add
,
as
a
commentary
on
this
offer
,
and
,
with
her
finger
on
her
nose
,
depart
.
   
<EOS>
steerforth
laugh
to
that
degree
,
that
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
help
laugh
too
;
though
I
be
not
sure
I
should
have
do
so
,
but
for
this
inducement
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
have
have
our
laugh
quite
out
,
which
be
after
some
time
,
he
tell
me
that
Miss
Mowcher
have
quite
an
extensive
connexion
,
and
make
herself
useful
to
a
variety
of
people
in
a
variety
of
way
.
 
<EOS>
some
people
trifle
with
her
as
a
mere
oddity
,
he
say
;
but
she
be
as
shrewdly
and
sharply
observant
as
anyone
he
know
,
and
as
long
-
head
as
she
be
short
-
armed
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
that
what
she
have
say
of
be
here
,
and
there
,
and
everywhere
,
be
true
enough
;
for
she
make
little
dart
into
the
province
,
and
seem
to
pick
up
customer
everywhere
,
and
to
know
everybody
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
him
what
her
disposition
be
:
whether
it
be
at
all
mischievous
,
and
if
her
sympathy
be
generally
on
the
right
side
of
thing
:
but
,
not
succeed
in
attract
his
attention
to
these
question
after
two
or
three
attempt
,
I
forbear
or
forget
to
repeat
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
instead
,
with
much
rapidity
,
a
good
deal
about
her
skill
,
and
her
profit
;
and
about
her
be
a
scientific
cupper
,
if
I
should
ever
have
occasion
for
her
service
in
that
capacity
.
   
<EOS>
She
be
the
principal
theme
of
our
conversation
during
the
evening
:
<EOS>
and
when
we
part
for
the
night
Steerforth
call
after
me
over
the
banister
,
"
Bob
swear
!
"
<EOS>
as
I
go
downstairs
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
,
when
I
come
to
Mr
Barkis
's
house
,
to
find
Ham
walk
up
and
down
in
front
of
it
,
and
still
more
surprised
to
learn
from
him
that
little
Em'ly
be
inside
.
 
<EOS>
I
naturally
inquire
why
he
be
not
there
too
,
instead
of
pace
the
street
by
himself
?
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
see
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
he
rejoin
,
in
a
hesitating
manner
,
"
Em'ly
,
she
be
talk
to
some
'
un
in
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
think
,
"
say
I
,
smile
,
"
that
that
be
a
reason
for
your
being
in
here
too
,
Ham
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
in
a
general
way
,
so
'
t
would
be
,
"
he
return
;
"
but
look'ee
here
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
lower
his
voice
,
and
speak
very
gravely
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
young
woman
,
sir
---
a
young
woman
,
that
Em'ly
know
once
,
and
doen't
ought
to
know
no
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
when
I
hear
these
word
,
a
light
begin
to
fall
upon
the
figure
I
have
see
follow
them
,
some
hour
ago
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
poor
wurem
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
say
Ham
,
"
as
be
trod
under
foot
by
all
the
town

up
street

down

<EOS>
the
mowld
o

the

<EOS>
"
do

<EOS>
"

Ham
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
like

<EOS>
not

I
know'd

soon
arterward
under

and
whisper

Martha

<EOS>
oh

Martha

for
they
have
sit
at
work
together
,
many
a
day
,
at
Mr
Omer

.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
cry
I
,
recall
one
of
the

She
want
to

Em'ly
could

<EOS>
I
feel

true

I
know
it

on
the
instant

quite
as
well

Em'ly
write
in

<EOS>
by

by
she
tell
me

Mas'r

ask
me
to
bring
her

<EOS>
what
can
I
do

<EOS>
She
doen't
ought
to
know
any

I
can
not

her
,
when

on

"
   
<EOS>
He
put
his
hand
into
the
breast
of
his
shaggy
jacket
,
and
take
out
with
great
care
a
pretty
little
purse
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
if
I
could
deny
her
when

tear
be
on

Mas'r
Davy
,
"
say
Ham
,
tenderly
adjust
it
on
the
rough
palm
of
his
hand
,
"
how
could
I
deny
her
when
she
give
me
this
to
carry
for
her
---
know
what
she
bring
it
for
?
 
<EOS>
such
a
toy
as
it
be
!
<EOS>
"
say
Ham
,
thoughtfully
look
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
with
such
a
little
money
in
it
,
Em'ly
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
shake
him
warmly
by
the
hand
when
he
have
put
it
away
again
---
for
that
<EOS>
be
more
satisfactory
to
me
than
say
anything
---
and
we
walk
up
and
down
,
for
a
minute
or
two
,
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
the
door
open
then
,
and
Peggotty
appear
,
beckon
to
Ham
to
come
in
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
keep
away
,
but
she
come
after
me
,
entreat
me
to
come
in
too
.
 
<EOS>
even
then
,
I
would
have
avoid
the
room
where
they
all
be
,
but
for
its
be
the
neat
-
tile
kitchen
I
have
mention
more
than
once
.
 
<EOS>
the
door
open
immediately
into
it
,
I
find
myself
among
them
before
I
consider
whither
I
be
go
.
   
<EOS>
the
girl
---
the
same
I
have
see
upon
the
sand
---
be
near
the
fire
.
<EOS>
She
be
sit
on
the
ground
,
with
her
head
and
one
arm
lie
on
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
,
from
the
disposition
of
her
figure
,
that
Em'ly
have
but
newly
rise
from
the
chair
,
and
that
the
forlorn
head
may
perhaps
have
be
lie
on
her
lap
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
but
<EOS>
little
of
the
girl
's
face
,
over
which
her
hair
fall
loose
and
scatter
,
as
if
she
have
be
disorder
it
with
her
own
hand
;
but
I
see
that
she
be
young
,
and
of
a
fair
complexion
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
have
be
cry
.
 
<EOS>
so
have
little
em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
not
a
word
be
speak
when
we
first
go
in
;
and
the
dutch
clock
by
the
dresser
seem
,
in
the
silence
,
to
tick
twice
as
loud
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
Em'ly
speak
first
.
   
<EOS>
"
Martha
want
,
"
she
say
to
Ham
,
"
to
go
to
London
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
to
London
?
<EOS>
"
return
Ham
.
   
<EOS>
He
stand
between
them
,
look
on
the
prostrate
girl
with
a
mixture
of
compassion
for
her
,
and
of
jealousy
of
her
hold
any
companionship
with
her
whom
he
love
so
well
,
which
I
have
always
remember
distinctly
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
speak
as
if
she
be
ill
;
in
a
soft
,
suppress
tone
that
be
plainly
hear
,
although
it
hardly
rise
above
a
whisper
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
there
than
here
,
"
say
a
third
voice
aloud
---
Martha
's
,
though
she
do
not
move
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
one
know
me
there

there

inquire
Ham
.
   
<EOS>
She
lift
up
her
head
,
and
look
darkly
round
at
him
for
a
moment
;
then
lay
it
down
again
,
and
curve
her
right
arm
about
her
neck
,
as
a
woman
in
a
fever
,
or
in
an
agony
of
pain
from
a
shot
,
may
twist
herself
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
will
try
to

<EOS>
Peggotty
shake
her
head
compassionately
.

"
I
will
try
,

Martha

me
away

I
never

do
bad
than
I

do
here

<EOS>
I
may
do
better

<EOS>
oh

"
with
a
dreadful
shiver
,
"
take
me
out
of
these
street

where
the
whole

know
me
from
a
child

<EOS>
as
Em'ly
hold
out
her
hand
to
Ham

I
see
him
put
in
it
a
little
canvas
bag
.
 
<EOS>
She
take
it
,
as
if
she
think
it
be
her
purse
,
and
make
a
step
or
two
forward
;
but
find
her
mistake
,
come
back
to
where
he
have
retire
near
me
,

show
it
to
him
.

"
It

the
tear
rise
freshly
in

eye

she
turn
away
and
go
to
Martha
.
 
<EOS>
what
she
give
her
,
I
do
not

<EOS>
I
see
her
stooping
over
her

put
money
in
her
bosom

She
whisper
something
,
as
she
ask
be
that
enough

<EOS>
"
More
than
enough

the
other

,

take
her
hand

it

then
Martha
arise
,
and
gather
her
shawl
about
her
,
cover
her
face
with
it

weep
aloud

go
slowly
to
the
door

<EOS>
She
stop
a
moment
before
go
out

as

would
have
utter
something

turn
back

no
word

her
lip

make

dreary

wretched

its
agony

She
get
calm
by
degree

then
we
soothe
her
;
now
talk
encouragingly

now
jest
a
little
with
her
,
until
she
begin
to
raise
her
head

speak
to
us

so
we
get
on
,
until
she
be
able
to
smile
,
and
then
to
laugh
,
and
then
to
sit
up
,
half
ashamed
;
while
Peggotty
recall
her
stray
ringlet

dry
her
eye

make
her
neat
again

lest
her

wonder

home

cry

I
see
her
do

that
night

never

I
see
her
innocently
kiss
her
choose
husband
on
the
cheek

creep
close
to
his
bluff
form
as
if
it
be
her
good
support

<EOS>
when
they
go
away
together
,
in
the
wane
moonlight
,
and
I
look
after
them
,
compare
their
departure
in
my
mind
with
Martha

Chapter
23
.
<EOS>
I
corroborate
Mr
Dick
,
and
choose
a
profession
 
when
I
awoke
in
the
morning
<EOS>
I
think
very
much
of
little
em'ly
,
and
her
emotion
last
night
,
after
Martha
have
leave
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
I
have
come
into
the
knowledge
of
those
domestic
weakness
and
tenderness
in
a
sacred
confidence
,
and
that
to
disclose
them
,
even
to
Steerforth
,
would
be
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
gentle
feeling
towards
anyone
than
towards
the
pretty
creature
who
have
be
my
playmate
,
and
whom
I
have
always
be
persuade
,
and
shall
always
be
persuade
,
to
my
die
day
,
I
then
devotedly
love
.
 
<EOS>
the
repetition
to
any
ear
---
even
to
Steerforth
's
---
of
what
she
have
be
unable
to
repress
when
her
heart
lie
open
to
me
by
an
accident
,
I
feel
would
be
a
rough
deed
,
unworthy
of
myself
,
unworthy
of
the
light
of
our
pure
childhood
,
which
I
always
see
encircle
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
a
resolution
,
therefore
,
to
keep
it
in
my
own
breast
;
and
there
it
give
her
image
a
new
grace
.
   
<EOS>
while
we
be
at
breakfast
,
a
letter
be
deliver
to
me
from
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
contain
matter
on
which
I
think
Steerforth
could
advise
me
as
well
as
anyone
,
and
on
which
I
know
I
should
be
delighted
to
consult
him
,
I
resolve
to
make
it
a
subject
of
discussion
on
our
journey
home
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
present
we
have
enough
to
do
,
in
take
leave
of
all
our
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Barkis
be
far
from
be
the
last
among
them
,
in
his
regret
at
our
departure
;
and
I
believe
would
even
have
open
the
box
again
,
and
sacrifice
another
guinea
,
if
it
would
have
keep
us
eight
-
and
-
forty
hour
in
Yarmouth
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
and
all
her
family
be
full
of
grief
at
our
going
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
house
of
Omer
and
Joram
turn
out
to
bid
us
good
-
bye
;
and
there
be
so
many
seafare
volunteer
in
attendance
on
Steerforth
,
when
our
portmanteaux
go
to
the
coach
,
that
if
we
have
have
the
baggage
of
a
regiment
with
us
,
we
should
hardly
have
want
porter
to
carry
it
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
we
depart
to
the
regret
and
admiration
of
all
concerned
,
and
leave
a
great
many
people
very
sorry
behind
US
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
stay
long
here
,
Littimer
?
"
say
I
,
as
he
stand
wait
to
see
the
coach
start
.
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
he
reply
;
"
probably
not
very
long
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
can
hardly
say
,
just
now
,
"
observe
Steerforth
,
carelessly
.
"
<EOS>
He
know
what
he
have
to
do
,
and
he
will
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
that
I
be
sure
he
will
,
"
say
I.
   
Littimer
touch
his
hat
in
acknowledgement
of
my
good
opinion
,
and
I
feel
about
eight
year
old
.
 
<EOS>
He
touch
it
once
more
,
wish
us
a
good
journey
;
and
we
leave
him
stand
on
the
pavement
,
as
respectable
a
mystery
as
any
pyramid
in
Egypt
.
   
<EOS>
for
some
little
time
we
hold
no
conversation
,
Steerforth
be
unusually
silent
,
and
I
be
sufficiently
engage
in
wonder
,
within
myself
,
when
I
should
see
the
old
place
again
,
and
what
new
change
may
happen
to
me
or
them
in
the
meanwhile
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
Steerforth
,
become
gay
and
talkative
in
a
moment
,
as
he
could
become
anything
he
like
at
any
moment
,
pull
me
by
the
arm
:
   
<EOS>
"
find
a
voice

Steerforth

I

that
I
come
out

look
about
me

a

of

you

indeed
I

I

particularly

to
tell
you
the
truth

I
be
afraid
I
have
forget
it

"
   
<EOS>
"
well
!
look
about
you
now
,
and
make
up
for
your
negligence

Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
look
to
the
right
,
and
you
will
see
a
flat
country
,
with
a
good
deal
of
marsh
in
it
;
look
to
the
left
,
and
you
will
see
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
look
to
the
front

and
you
will
find
no
difference

;
look
to
the
rear

there
it
be
still
.
<EOS>
"
I
laugh
,
and
reply
that
I
see
no
suitable
profession
in
the
whole
prospect
;
which
be
perhaps
to
be
attribute
to
its
flatness
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
say
our
aunt
on
the
subject
?

inquire
Steerforth

glance
at
the

anything

yes

I.

She
ask
me

here

Steerforth

coolly

You
may

well

that
as
anything
else

suppose

I
could
not
help
laugh
again
,
at
his
balance
all
calling
and
profession
so
equally
;
and
I
tell
him
so

<EOS>
"
what
be
a

I.

You

They

<EOS>
I
make
allowance
for
Steerforth
's
light
way
of
treat
the
subject
,
and
,
consider
it
with
reference
to
the
staid
air
of
gravity
and
antiquity
which
I
associate
with
that
"
lazy
old
nook
near
St

,
do
not
feel
indisposed
towards
my

which
she
leave
to

make
no

occur

I
mention
it

Daisy

my
advice
be
that
you
take
kindly

common

<EOS>
I
quite
make
up
my
mind
to
do
so

<EOS>
I
then
tell
Steerforth
that
my
aunt
be
in
town
await
me
(
as
I
find
from
her
letter
)
,
and
that
she
have
take
lodging
for
a
week
at
a
kind
of
private
hotel
at
Lincoln
's
Inn
Fields
,
where
there
be
a
stone
staircase
,
and
a
convenient
door
in
the
roof
;
my

be
firmly
persuade
that
every
house
in
London
be
go
to
be
burn
down
every
night

<EOS>
We
achieve
the
rest
of
our
journey
pleasantly
,
sometimes
recur
to
doctor
'
Commons
,
and
anticipate
the
distant
day
when
I
should
be
a
proctor
there
,
which
Steerforth
picture
in
a
variety
of
humorous
and
whimsical
light
,
that
make
us
both
merry
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
our
journey
's
end
,
he
go
home
,
engage
to
call
upon
me
next
day
but
one
;
and
I
drive
to
Lincoln
's
Inn
Fields
,
where
I
find
my
aunt
up
,
and
wait
supper
.
   
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
round
the
world

we
could
hardly
have
be
better
pleased

<EOS>
My

cry
outright

she
embrace
me

pretend
to
laugh

that
if
my

have

alive

would
have
shed

she
have
no

I

off

want
strength

<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
leave
Janet
at

instead

then
my

have
be
at

if
ever
there
be

my

with
emphasis

I
try
to
comfort

on

point

reject
consolation

<EOS>
"
It

my

it

Janet
venture
to
suggest
that
my

disturb
herself
unnecessarily

that
she
believe
the

be
then
engage
in

gravel
line
of
business
,

be

<EOS>
but
my
aunt
would
not
hear
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
supper
be
comfortably
serve
and
hot
,
though
my
aunt
's
room
be
very
high
up
---
whether
that
she
may
have
more
stone
stair
for
her
money
,
or
may
be
near
to
the
door
in
the
roof
,
I
do
not
know
---
and
consist
of
a
roast
fowl
,
a
steak
,
and
some
vegetable
,
to
all
of
which
I
do
ample
justice
,
and
which
be
all
excellent
.
<EOS>
but
my
aunt
have
her
own
idea
concern
London
provision
,
and
eat
but
little
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
this
unfortunate
fowl
be
bear
and
bring
up
in
a
cellar
,
"
say
my
aunt
,
"
and
never
take
the
air
except
on
a
hackney
coach

stand

<EOS>
I
hope
the
steak
may
be
beef
,

I
do
not
believe
it

<EOS>
nothing
be
genuine
in
the
place

in
my
opinion

the
dirt

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
think
the
fowl
may
have
come
out
of

I
hint

<EOS>
"
certainly
not

my

It
would
be
no
pleasure

a
London
tradesman

what
he
pretend
it
be

"
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
venture
to
controvert
this
opinion

I
make
a
good
supper
,
which
it
greatly
satisfy
her
to
see
me
do

<EOS>
when
the
table
be
clear
,
Janet
assist
her
to
arrange
her
hair

to
put
on
her
nightcap

which
be
of
a
smart
construction
than
usual
(

in

,
my
aunt
say
)
,
and
to
fold
her
gown
back
over
her
knee

these
be
her
usual
preparation

warm
herself

could

me
to
do
so
too
.
   
<EOS>
at
about
mid
-
day
,
we
set
out
for
the
office
of
Messrs
Spenlow
and
Jorkins
,
in
doctor
'
Commons
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
who
have
this
other
general
opinion
in
reference
to
London
,
that
every
man
she
see
be
a
pickpocket
,
give
me
her
purse
to
carry
for
her
,
which
have
ten
guinea
in
it
and
some
silver
.
   
<EOS>
We
make
a
pause
at
the
toy
shop
in
Fleet
Street
,
to
see
the
giant
of
Saint
Dunstan
's
strike
upon
the
bell
---
we
have
time
our
go
,
so
as
to
catch
them
at
it
,
at
twelve
o'clock
---
and
then
go
on
towards
Ludgate
Hill
,
and
St
Paul
's
Churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
cross
to
the
former
place
,
when
I
find
that
my
aunt
greatly
accelerate
her
speed
,
and
look
frightened
.
 
<EOS>
I
observe
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
a
lower
ill

dressed
man
who
have
stop
and
stare
at
us
in
pass
,
a
little
before
,
be
come
so
close
after
us
as
to
brush
against
her

<EOS>
"
Trot

<EOS>
My

"
cry
my
aunt
,
in
a
terrified
whisper
,
and
press
my
arm
.
 
<EOS>
"
I

say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
.
<EOS>
step
into
a
shop
,
and
I
will
soon
get
rid
of
this

<EOS>
"
Good

say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
He

nothing
but
a
sturdy
beggar

"
   
<EOS>
"
You

reply
my

<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
You

"
   
<EOS>
We
have
stop
in
an
empty
door
-
way
,
while
this
be
pass
,
and
he
have
stop
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
not
look
at
him

"
<EOS>
say
my
aunt
,
as
I
turn
my
head
indignantly
,
"
but
get
me
a
coach
,
my
dear
,
and
wait
for
me
in
St
Paul
's
Churchyard
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
wait
for

"
<EOS>
I
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
yes

"
rejoin
my

<EOS>
"
I
must
go

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
"
with

<EOS>
this

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be

"
she
reply
,
"
and
I
tell
you
I
must
.
 
<EOS>
get
mea
coach
!
"
   
<EOS>
however
much
astonished
I
may
be
,
I
be
sensible
that
I
have
no
right
to
refuse
compliance
with
such
a
peremptory
command
.
 
<EOS>
I
hurry
away
a
few
pace
,
and
call
a
hackney
-
chariot
which
be
pass
empty
.
 
<EOS>
almost
before
I
could
let
down
the
step
,
my
aunt
spring
in
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
know
how
,
and
the
man
follow
.
 
<EOS>
She
wave
her
hand
to
me
to
go
away
,
so
earnestly
,
that
,
all
confound
as
I
be
,
I
turn
from
them
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
in
do
so
,
I
hear
her
say
to
the
coachman
,
"
drive
anywhere
!
 
<EOS>
drive
straight
on
!
"
<EOS>
and
presently
the
chariot
pass
me
,
go
up
the
hill
.
   
<EOS>
what
Mr
Dick
have
tell
me
,
and
what
I
have
suppose
to
be
a
delusion
of
his
,
now
come
into
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
doubt
that
this
person
be
the
person
of
whom
he
have
make
such
mysterious
mention
,
though
what
the
nature
of
his
hold
upon
my
aunt
could
possibly
be
,
I
be
quite
unable
to
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
after
half
an
hour
's
cooling
in
the
churchyard
,
I
see
the
chariot
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
the
driver
stop
beside
me
,
and
my
aunt
be
sit
in
it
alone
.
   
<EOS>
She
have
not
yet
sufficiently
recover
from
her
agitation
to
be
quite
prepared
for
the
visit
we
have
to
make
.
 
<EOS>
She
desire
me
to
get
into
the
chariot
,
and
to
tell
the
coachman
to
drive
slowly
up
and
down
a
little
while
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
no
more
,
except
,
<EOS>
"
My
dear
child
,
never
ask
me
what
it
be
,
and
do
not
refer
to
it
,
"
until
she
have
perfectly
regain
her
composure
,
when
she
tell
me
she
be
quite
herself
now
,
and
we
may
get
out
.
 
<EOS>
on
her
give
me
her
purse
to
pay
the
driver
,
I
find
that
all
the
guinea
be
go
,
and
only
the
loose
silver
remain
.
   
<EOS>
doctor
'
Commons
be
approach
by
a
little
low
archway
.
 
<EOS>
before
we
have
take
many
pace
down
the
street
beyond
it
,
the
noise
of
the
city
seem
to
melt
,
as
if
by
magic
,
into
a
softened
distance
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
dull
court
and
narrow
way
bring
us
to
the
sky
-
light
office
of
Spenlow
and
Jorkins
;
in
the
vestibule
of

temple
,
accessible
to

without

ceremony
of
knock
,
three
or
four

<EOS>
one
of
these
,
a
little
dry
man
,
sit
by
himself
,
who
wear
a
stiff
brown
wig
that
look
as
if
it
be
make
of
gingerbread
,
rise
to
receive
my
aunt
,
and
show
us
into
Mr
Spenlow

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr

say
the
dry
man
;
"
it
be
an
Arches
day
;
but
it
be
close
by
,
and
I
will
send
for
him
directly
.
"
   
<EOS>
as
we
be
leave
to
look
about
us
while
Mr
Spenlow
be
fetch
,
I
avail
myself
of
the
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
the
furniture
of
the
room
be
old
-
fashioned
and
dusty
;
and
the
green
baize
on
the
top
of
the
writing
-
table
have
lose
all
its
colour
,
and
be
as
withered
and
pale
as
an
old
pauper
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
many
bundle
of
paper
on
it
,
some
endorse
as
Allegations
,
and
some
(
to
my
surprise
)
as
Libels
,
and
some
as
be
in
the
Consistory
Court
,
and
some
in
the
Arches
Court
,
and
some
in
the
Prerogative
Court
,
and
some
in
the
Admiralty
Court
,
and
some
in
the
Delegates
'
Court
;
give
me
occasion
to
wonder
much
,
how
many
court
there
may
be
in
the
gross
,
and
how
long
it
would
take
to
understand
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
besides
these
,
there
be
sundry
immense
manuscript
Books
of
Evidence
take
on
affidavit
,
strongly
bind
,
and
tie
together
in
massive
set
,
a
set
to
each
cause
,
as
if
every
cause
be
a
history
in
ten
or
twenty
volume
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
look
tolerably
expensive
,
I
think
,
and
give
me
an
agreeable
notion
of
a
proctor
's
business
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
cast
my
eye
with
increase
complacency
over
these
and
many
similar
object
,
when
hasty
footstep
be
hear
in
the
room
outside
,
and
Mr
Spenlow
,
in
a
black
gown
trim
with
white
fur
,
come
hurry
in
,
take
off
his
hat
as
he
come
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
a
little
light
-
haired
gentleman
,
with
undeniable
boot
,
and
the
stiff
of
white
cravat
and
shirt
-
collar
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
button
up
,
mighty
trim
and
tight
,
and
must
have
take
a
great
deal
of
pain
with
his
whisker
,
which
be
accurately
curl
.
 
<EOS>
His
gold
watch
-
chain
be
so
massive
,
that
a
fancy
come
across
me
,
that
he
ought
to
have
a
sinewy
golden
arm
,
to
draw
it
out
with
,
like
those
which
be
put
up
over
the
goldbeater
'
shop
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
get
up
with
such
care
,
and
be
so
stiff
,
that
he
could
hardly
bend
himself
;
be
oblige
,
when
he
glance
at
some
paper
on
his
desk
,
after
sit
down
in
his
chair
,
to
move
his
whole
body
,
from
the
bottom
of
his
spine
,
like
Punch

<EOS>
I
have
previously
be
present
by
my
aunt
,
and
have
be
courteously
receive
.
 
<EOS>
He
now
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
and
so
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
you
think
of
enter
into
our
profession
?
 
<EOS>
I
casually
mention
to
Miss
Trotwood
,
when
I
have
the
pleasure
of
an
interview
with
her
the
other
day
,
"
---
with
another
inclination
of
his
body
---
punch
again
---
"
that
there
be
a
vacancy
here
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Trotwood
be
good
enough
to
mention
that
she
have
a
nephew
who
be
her
peculiar
care
,
and
for
whom
she
be
seek
to
provide
genteelly
in
life
.
 
<EOS>
that
nephew
,
I
believe
,
I
have
now
the
pleasure
of
"
---
punch
again
.
<EOS>
I
bow
my
acknowledgement
,
and
say
,
my
aunt
have
mention
to
me
that
there
be
that
opening
,
and
that
I
believe
I
should
like
it
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
be
strongly
inclined
to
like
it
,
and
have
take
immediately
to
the
proposal
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
could
not
absolutely
pledge
myself
to
like
it
,
until
I
know
something
more
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
that
although
it
be
little
else
than
a
matter
of
form
,
I
presume
I
should
have
an
opportunity
of
try
how
I
like
it
,
before
I
bind
myself
to
it
irrevocably
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
surely
!
<EOS>
surely
!
"
say
Mr
Spenlow
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
always
,
in
this
house
,
propose
a
month

an
initiatory
month

<EOS>
I
should
be
happy
,
myself
,
to
propose
two
month
---
three
---
an
indefinite
period

in
fact

I
have
a

"
say
Mr
Spenlow

<EOS>
"
as
I
have
mention
to
Miss
Trotwood
,
I
be
actuate
by
no
mercenary
consideration

few
man
be
less
so
,
I
believe
;
but
Mr
Jorkins
have
his
opinion
on
these
subject

and
I
be
bind
to
respect
Mr
Jorkins
's
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jorkins
think
a
thousand
pound
too
little
,
in
short
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
sir
,
"
say
I
,
still
desire
to
spare
my
aunt
,
"
that
it
be
not
the
custom
here
,
if
an
article
clerk
be
particularly
useful
,
and
make
himself
a
perfect
master
of
his
profession
"
---
I
could
not
help
blush
<EOS>
,
this
look
so
like
praise
myself
---
"
I
suppose
it
be
not
the
custom
,
in
the
later
year
of
his
time
,
to
allow
him
any
---
"
   
Mr
Spenlow
,
by
a
great
effort
,
just
lift
his
head
far
enough
out
of
his
cravat
to
shake
it
,
and
answer
,
anticipate
the
word
"
salary
"
:
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no

<EOS>
I
will
not
say
what
consideration
I
may
give
to
that
point
myself
,
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
,
if
I
be
unfettered
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jorkins
be
immovable
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
quite
dismay
by
the
idea
of
this
terrible
Jorkins
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
find
out
afterwards
that
he
be
a
mild
man
of
a
heavy
temperament
,
whose
place
in
the
business
be
to
keep
himself
in
the
background
,
and
be
constantly
exhibit
by
name
as
the
most
obdurate
and
ruthless
of
man
.
 
<EOS>
if
a
clerk
want
his
salary
raise
,
Mr
Jorkins
would
not
listen
to
such
a
proposition
.
 
<EOS>
if
a
client
be
slow
to
settle
his
bill
of
cost
,
Mr
Jorkins
be
resolve
to
have
it
pay
;
and
however
painful
these
thing
may
be
(
and
always
be
)
to
the
feeling
of
Mr
Spenlow
,
Mr
Jorkins
would
have
his
bond
.
 
<EOS>
the
heart
and
hand
of
the
good
angel
Spenlow
would
have
be
always
open
,
but
for
the
restrain
demon
Jorkins
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
have
grow
old
,
I
think
I
have
have
experience
of
some
other
house
do
business
on
the
principle
of
Spenlow
and
Jorkins
!
   
<EOS>
It
be
settle
that
I
should
begin
my
month
's
probation
as
soon
as
I
please
,
and
that
my
aunt
nee
neither
remain
in
town
nor
return
at
its
expiration
,
as
the
article
of
agreement
,
of
which
I
be
to
be
the
subject
,
could
easily
be
send
to
her
at
home
for
her
signature
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
have
get
so
far
,
Mr
Spenlow
offer
to
take
me
into
Court
then
and
there
,
and
show
me
what
sort
of
place
it
be
.
<EOS>
as
I
be
willing
enough
to
know
,
we
go
out
with
this
object
,
leave
my
aunt
behind
;
who
would
trust
herself
,
she
say
,
in
no
such
place
,
and
who
,
I
think
,
regard
all
Courts
of
Law
as
a
sort
of
powder
-
mill
that
may
blow
up
at
any
time
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
conduct
me
through
a
paved
courtyard
form
of
grave
brick
house
,
which
I
infer
,
from
the
doctor

name
upon
the
door
,
to
be
the
official
abide
-
place
of
the
learn
advocate
of
whom
Steerforth
have
tell
me
;
and
into
a
large
dull
room
,
not
unlike
a
chapel
to
my
thinking
,
on
the
left
hand
.
 
<EOS>
the
upper
part
of
this
room
be

I
find
to

<EOS>
blink
over
a
little

like
a

in
the
curve

be
an
old

whom
,
if
I
have
see
him
in

I

certainly
have
take

Their

in

I
think
,
and
their
look
haughty
;
but
in
this
last
respect
I
presently
conceive
I
have
do
them
an
injustice
,
for
when
two
or
three
of
them
have
to
rise
and
answer
a
question
of

I

the

by
the
chirping
of
this

by
the
voice

one
of

slowly
through
a
perfect

little

I

it
would
be
quite
a
soothing
opiate
to
belong
to
it
in
any
character
---
except
perhaps
as
a
suitor
.
   
<EOS>
very
well
satisfied
with
the
dreamy
nature
of
this
retreat
,
I
inform
Mr
Spenlow
that
I
have
see
enough
for
that
time
,
and
we
rejoin
my

in

We

encounter
an
unlucky
donkey
in
a
costermonger

who
suggest
painful
association
to
my

<EOS>
We
have
another
long

when

I

could

I
urge
her
not

<EOS>
It

not

we

we
could
prevail
on
Mrs

at

They

consist
of
a
little
half

blind
entry
where
you

a

pantry
where
you

<EOS>
the

sure

<EOS>
as
I
be
delighted
with
the
place

my

withdraw
into

hardly
daring

<EOS>
after
a
single
combat
of
some
duration
they
return

I

<EOS>
in
short
,
my
aunt

see
how
enraptured
I
be
with
the
premise

take
them
for
a
month

with
leave
to
remain
for
twelve
month
when
that

<EOS>
Mrs

every
other
necessary
be
already
provide

and
Mrs
Crupp
expressly
intimate
that
she
should
always
yearn
towards
me
as
a
son
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
to
take
possession
the
day
after
tomorrow

and
Mrs

say
,
thank
Heaven
<EOS>
she
have
now
find
summun
she
could
care
for

<EOS>
on
our
way
back
,
my
aunt
inform
me
how
she
confidently
trust
that
the
life
I
be
now
to
lead
would
make
me
firm
and
self

reliant
,
which
be
all
I
want
.
 
<EOS>
She
repeat
this
several
time
next
day
,
in
the
interval
of
our
arranging
for
the
transmission
of
my
clothe
and
book
from
Mr
Wickfield
's
;
relative
to
which
,
and
to
all
my
late
holiday

I
write
a
long
letter
to
Agnes

of
which
my

take
charge
,
as
she
be
to
leave
on
the
succeed
day
.
 
<EOS>
not
to
lengthen
these
particular
,
I
need
only
add
,
that
she
make
a
handsome
provision
for
all
my
possible
want
during
my
month
of
trial
;
that
Steerforth
,
to
my
great
disappointment
and
her
too
,
do
not
make
his
appearance
before
she
go
away
;
that
I
see
her
safely
seat
in
the
Dover
coach
,
exult
in
the
come
discomfiture
of
the
vagrant
donkey
,
with
Janet
at
her
side
;
and
that
when
the
coach
be
go
,
I
turn
my
face
to
the
Adelphi
,
ponder
on
the
old
day
when
I
use
to
roam
about
its
subterranean
arch
,
and
on
the
happy
change
which
have
bring
me
to
the
surface

Chapter

<EOS>
My
first
dissipation
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
wonderfully
fine
thing
to
have
that
lofty
castle
to
myself
,
and
to
feel
,
when
I
shut
my
outer
door
,
like
Robinson
Crusoe
,
when
he
have
get
into
his
fortification
,
and
pull
his
ladder
up
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
wonderfully
fine
thing
to
walk
about
town
with
the
key
of
my
house
in
my
pocket
,
and
to
know
that
I
could
ask
any
fellow
to
come
home
,
and
make
quite
sure
of
its
be
inconvenient
to
nobody
,
if
it
be
not
so
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
wonderfully
fine
thing
to
let
myself
in
and
out
,
and
to
come
and
go
without
a
word
to
anyone
,
and
to
ring
Mrs
Crupp
up
,
gasping
,
from
the
depth
of
the
earth
,
<EOS>
when
I
want
her
---
and
when
she
be
dispose
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
,
I
say
,
be
wonderfully
fine
;
but
I
must
say
,
too
,
that
there
be
time
when
it
be
very
dreary
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
fine
in
the
morning
,
particularly
in
the
fine
morning
.
 
<EOS>
It
look
a
very
fresh
,
free
life
,
by
daylight
:
still
fresher
,
and
more
free
,
by
sunlight
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
the
day
decline
,
the
life
seem
to
go
down
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
it
be
;
it
seldom
look
well
by
candle
-
light
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
somebody
to
talk
to
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
miss
Agnes
.
<EOS>
I
find
a
tremendous
blank
,
in
the
place
of
that
smile
repository
of
my
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Crupp
appear
to
be
a
long
way
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
about
my
predecessor
,
who
have
die
of
drink
and
smoke
;
and
I
could
have
wish
he
have
be
so
good
as
to
live
,
and
not
bother
me
with
his
decease
.
   
<EOS>
after
two
day
and
night
,
I
feel
as
if
I
have
live
there
for
a
year
,
and
yet
I
be
not
an
hour
old
,
but
be
quite
as
much
torment
by
my
own
youthfulness
as
ever
.
   
<EOS>
steerforth
not
yet
appear
,
which
induce
me
to
apprehend
that
he
must
be
ill
,
I
leave
the
Commons
early
on
the
third
day
,
and
walk
out
to
Highgate
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Steerforth
be
very
glad
to
see
me
,
and
say
that
he
have
go
away
with
one
of
his
Oxford
friend
to
see
another
who
live
near
St
Albans
,
but
that
she
expect
him
to
return
tomorrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
fond
of
him
,
that
I
feel
quite
jealous
of
his
Oxford
friend
.
   
<EOS>
as
she
press
me
to
stay
to
dinner
,
I
remain
,
and
I
believe
we
talk
about
nothing
but
him
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
how
much
the
people
like
him
at
Yarmouth
,
and
what
a
delightful
companion
he
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Dartle
be
full
of
hint
and
mysterious
question
,
but
take
a
great
interest
in
all
our
proceeding
there
,
and
say
,
"
be
it
really
though
?
"
<EOS>
and
so
forth
,
so
often
,
that
she
get
everything
out
of
me
<EOS>
she
want
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
Her
appearance
be
exactly
what
I
have
describe
it
,
when
I
first
see
her
;
but
the
society
of
the
two
lady
be
so
agreeable
,
and
come
so
natural
to
me
,
that
I
feel
myself
fall
a
little
in
love
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
think
,
several
time
in
the
course
of
the
evening
,
and
particularly
when
I
walk
home
at
night
,
what
delightful
company
she
would
be
in
Buckingham
Street
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
take
my
coffee
and
roll
in
the
morning
,
before
go
to
the
Commons
---
and
I
may
observe
in
this
place
that
it
be
surprising
how
much
coffee
Mrs
Crupp
use
,
and
how
weak
it
be
,
<EOS>
consider
---
when
Steerforth
himself
walk
in
,
to
my
unbounded
joy
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
steerforth
,
"
cry
I
,
"
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
I

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
carry
off
,
by
force
of
arm
,
"
say
Steerforth
,
"
the
very
next
morning
after
I
get
home
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
Daisy
,
what
a
rare
old
bachelor

here

"
   
<EOS>
I
show
him
over
the
establishment
,
not
omit
the
pantry
,
with
no
little
pride
,
and
he
commend
it
highly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what

old

"
he
add
,
"
I

make
quite
a
town

house
of
this
place
,
unless

me
notice
to

"
   
<EOS>
this
be
a
delightful
hearing
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
if
he
wait
for
that
,
he
would
have
to
wait
till
doomsday
.
   
<EOS>
"
but
you
shall
have
some
breakfast

"
<EOS>

I
,
with
my
hand
on
the
bell

rope
,
"
and
Mrs
Crupp

make
you
some
fresh

I
return
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
they
would
come
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
they
would
come
fast
enough
,
"
say
Steerforth
;
"
but
we
should
inconvenience
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
better
come
and
dine
with
us
somewhere
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
would
not
by
any
mean
consent
to
this
,
for
it
occur
to
me
that
I
really
ought
to
have
a
little
house
-
warming
,
and
that
there
never
could
be
a
well
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
new
pride
in
my
room
after
his
approval
of
them
,
and
burn
with
a
desire
to
develop
their
utmost
resource
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
make
him
promise
positively
in
the
name
of
his
two
friend
,
and
we
appoint
six
o'clock
as
the
dinner
-
hour
.
   
<EOS>
when
he
be
go
,
I
ring
for
Mrs
Crupp
,
and
acquaint
her
with
my
desperate
design
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Crupp
say
,
in
the
first
place
,
of
course
it
be
well
known
she
could
not
be
expect
to
wait
,
but
she
know
a
handy
young
man
,
who
she
think
could
be
prevail
upon
to
do
it
,
and
whose
term
would
be
five
shilling
,
and
what
I
please
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
certainly
we
would
have
him
.
 
<EOS>
Next
Mrs
Crupp
say
it
be
clear
she
could
not
be
in
two
place
at
once
(
which
I
feel
to
be
reasonable
)
,
and
that
"
a
young
gal
"
station
in
the
pantry
with
a
bedroom
candle
,
there
never
to
desist
from
washing
plate
,
would
be
indispensable
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
what
would
be
the
expense
of
this
young
female
?
<EOS>
and
Mrs
Crupp
say
she
suppose
eighteenpence
<EOS>
would
neither
make
me
nor
break
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
I
suppose
not
;
and
that
be
settle
.
 
<EOS>
then
Mrs
Crupp
say
,
now
about
the
dinner
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
remarkable
instance
of
want
of
forethought
on
the
part
of
the
ironmonger
who
have
make
Mrs
Crupp
's
kitchen
fireplace
,
that
it
be
capable
of
cook
nothing
but
chop
and
mash
potato
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
a
fish
-
kittle
,
Mrs
Crupp
say
,
well
!
<EOS>
would
I
only
come
and
look
at
the
range
?
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
say
fair
than
that
.
 
<EOS>
Would
I
come
and
look
at
it
?
 
<EOS>
as
I
should
not
have
be
much
the
wise
if
I
have
look
at
it
,
I
decline
,
and
say
,
"
never
mind
fish
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
Mrs
Crupp
say
,
do
not
say
that
;
oyster
be
in
,
why
not
them
?
 
<EOS>
so
that
be
settle
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Crupp
then
say
what
she
would
recommend
would
be
this
.
 
<EOS>
a
pair
of
hot
roast
fowl
---
from
the
pastry
-
cook
's
;
a
dish
of
stewed
beef
,
with
vegetable
---
from
the
pastry
-
cook
's
;
two
little
corner
thing
,
as
a
raise
pie
and
a
dish
of
kidney
---
from
the
pastrycook
's
;
a
tart
,
and
(
if
I
like
)
a
shape
of
jelly
---
from
the
pastrycook
's
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
Mrs
Crupp
say
,
would
leave
her
at
full
liberty
to
concentrate
her
mind
on
the
potato
,
and
to
serve
up
the
cheese
and
celery
as
she
could
wish
to
see
it
do
.
   
<EOS>
I
act
on
Mrs
Crupp
's
opinion
,
and
give
the
order
at
the
pastry
-
cook
's
myself
.
 
<EOS>
walk
along
the
Strand
,
afterwards
,
and
observe
a
hard
mottle
substance
in
the
window
of
a
ham
and
beef
shop
,
which
resemble
marble
,
but
be
label
"
Mock
Turtle
"
,
I
go
in
and
buy
a
slab
of
it
,
which
I
have
since
see
reason
to
believe
would
have
suffice
for
fifteen
people
.
 
<EOS>
this
preparation
,
Mrs
Crupp
,
after
some
difficulty
,
consent
to
warm
up
;
and
it
shrink
so
much
in
a
liquid
state
,
that
we
find
it
what
steerforth
call
"
rather
a
tight
fit
"
for
four
.
   
<EOS>
these
preparation
happily
complete
,
I
buy
a
little
dessert
in
Covent
Garden
Market
,
and
give
a
rather
extensive
order
at
a
retail
wine
-
merchant
be
in
that
vicinity
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
come
home
in
the
afternoon
,
and
see
the
bottle
draw
up
in
a
square
on
the
pantry
floor
,
they
look
so
numerous
(
though
there
be
two
missing
,
which
make
Mrs
Crupp
very
uncomfortable
)
,
<EOS>
that
I
be
absolutely
frightened
at
them
.
   
<EOS>
one
of
Steerforth
's
friend
be
name
Grainger
,
and
the
other
Markham
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
both
very
gay
and
lively
fellow
;
Grainger
,
something
old
than
Steerforth
;
Markham
,
youthful
-
look
,
and
I
should
say
not
more
than
twenty
.
 
<EOS>
I
observe
that
the
latter
always
speak
of
himself
indefinitely
,
as
"
a
man
"
,
and
seldom
or
never
in
the
first
person
singular
.
   
<EOS>
"
a
man
may
get
on
very
well
here
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
say
Markham
---
mean
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
a
bad
situation
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
the
room
be
really
commodious
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
have
both
bring
appetite
with
you
?
"
say
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
upon
my
honour
,
"
return
Markham
,
"
town
seem
to
sharpen
a
man
's
appetite
.
 
<EOS>
a
man
be
hungry
all
day
long
.
 
<EOS>
a
man
be
perpetually
eat
.
"
   
<EOS>
be
a
little
embarrassed
at
first
,
and
feel
much
too
young
to
preside
,
I
make
Steerforth
take
the
head
of
the
table
when
dinner
be
announce
,
and
seat
myself
opposite
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
everything
be
very
good
;
we
do
not
spare
the
wine
;
and
he
exert
himself
so
brilliantly
to
make
the
thing
pass
off
well
,
that
there
be
no
pause
in
our
festivity
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
quite
such
good
company
during
dinner
as
I
could
have
wish
to
be
<EOS>
,
for
my
chair
be
opposite
the
door
,
and
my
attention
be
distract
by
observe
that
the
handy
young
man
go
out
of
the
room
very
often
,
and
that
his
shadow
always
present
itself
,
immediately
afterwards
,
on
the
wall
of
the
entry
,
with
a
bottle
at
its
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
the
"
young
gal
"
likewise
occasion
me
some
uneasiness
:
not
so
much
by
neglect
to
wash
the
plate
,
as
by
break
them
.
 
<EOS>
for
be
of
an
inquisitive
disposition
,
and
unable
to
confine
herself
(
as
her
positive
instruction
be
)
to
the
pantry
,
she
be
constantly
peer
in
at
us
,
and
constantly
imagine
herself
detect
;
in
which
belief
,
she
several
time
retire
upon
the
plate
(
with
which
she
have
carefully
pave
the
floor
)
,
and
do
a
great
deal
of
destruction
.
   
<EOS>
these
,
however
,
be
small
drawback
,
and
easily
forget
when
the
cloth
be
clear
,
and
the
dessert
put
on
the
table
;
at
which
period
of
the
entertainment
the
handy
young
man
be
discover
to
be
speechless
.
 
<EOS>
give
him
private
direction
to
seek
the
society
of
Mrs
Crupp
,
and
to
remove
the
"
young
gal
"
to
the
basement
also
,
I
abandon
myself
to
enjoyment
.
   
<EOS>
I
begin
,
by
be
singularly
cheerful
and
light
-
hearted
;
all
sort
of
half
-
forget
thing
to
talk
about
,
come
rush
into
my
mind
,
and
make
me
hold
forth
in
a
most
unwonted
manner
.
 
<EOS>
I
laugh
heartily
at
my
own
joke
,
and
everybody
else
's
;
call
Steerforth
to
order
for
not
pass
the
wine
;
make
several
engagement
to
go
to
Oxford
;
announce
that
I
mean
to
have
a
dinner
-
party
exactly
like
that
,
once
a
week
,
until
further
notice
;
and
madly
take
so
much
snuff
out
of
Grainger
's
box
,
that
I
be
oblige
to
go
into
the
pantry
,
and
have
a
private
fit
of
sneeze
ten
minute
long
.
   
<EOS>
I
go
on
,
by
pass
the
wine
faster
and
faster
yet
,
and
continually
start
up
with
a
corkscrew
to
open
more
wine
,
long
before
any
be
need
.
 
<EOS>
I
propose
Steerforth
's
health
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
he
be
my
dear
friend
,
the
protector
of
my
boyhood
,
and
the
companion
of
my
prime
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
I
be
delighted
to
propose
his
health
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
I
owe
him
more
obligation
than
I
could
ever
repay
,
and
hold
him
in
a
high
admiration
than
I
could
ever
express
.
 
<EOS>
I
finish
by
say
,
"
I
will
give
you
Steerforth
!
 
<EOS>
God
bless
him
!
 
<EOS>
Hurrah
!
<EOS>
"
We
give
him
three
time
three
,
and
another
,
and
a
good
one
to
finish
with
.
 
<EOS>
I
break
my
glass
in
go
round
the
table
to
shake
hand
with
him
,
and
I
say
(
in
two
word
)
<EOS>
"
steerforth
---
you'retheguidingstarofmyexistence
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
go
on
,
by
find
suddenly
that
somebody
be
in
the
middle
of
a
song
.
 
<EOS>
Markham
be
the
singer
,
and
he
sing
"
when
the
heart
of
a
man
be
depressed
with
care
"
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
when
he
have
sing
it
,
he
would
give
us
"
Woman
!
<EOS>
"
I
take
objection
to
that
,
and
I
could
not
allow
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
it
be
not
a
respectful
way
of
propose
the
toast
,
and
I
would
never
permit
that
toast
to
be
drunk
in
my
house
otherwise
than
as
"
the
Ladies
!
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
high
with
him
,
mainly
I
think
because
I
see
Steerforth
and
Grainger
laugh
at
me
---
or
at
him
---
or
at
both
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
a
man
be
not
to
be
dictate
to
.
<EOS>
I
say
a
man
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
a
man
be
not
to
be
insult
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
he
be
right
there
---
never
under
my
roof
,
where
the
lare
be
sacred
,
and
the
law
of
hospitality
paramount
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
it
be
no
derogation
from
a
man
's
dignity
to
confess
that
I
be
a
devilish
good
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
I
instantly
propose
his
health
.
   
<EOS>
somebody
be
smoke
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
all
smoking
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
smoke
,
and
try
to
suppress
a
rise
tendency
to
shudder
.
 
<EOS>
Steerforth
have
make
a
speech
about
me
,
in
the
course
of
which
I
have
be
affect
almost
to
tear
.
 
<EOS>
I
return
thank
,
and
hope
the
present
company
would
dine
with
me
tomorrow
,
and
the
day
after
---
each
day
at
five
o'clock
,
that
we
may
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
conversation
and
society
through
a
long
evening
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
call
upon
to
propose
an
individual
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
give
them
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Betsey
Trotwood
,
the
good
of
her
sex
!
   
<EOS>
somebody
be
lean
out
of
my
bedroom
window
,
refresh
his
forehead
against
the
cool
stone
of
the
parapet
,
and
feel
the
air
upon
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
address
myself
as
"
Copperfield
"
,
and
say
,
"
why
do
you
try
to
smoke
?
 
<EOS>
You
may
have
know
you
could
not
do
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
now
,
somebody
be
unsteadily
contemplate
his
feature
in
the
looking
-
glass
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
I
too
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
pale
in
the
looking
-
glass
;
my
eye
have
a
vacant
appearance
;
and
my
hair
---
only
my
hair
,
nothing
else
---
look
drunk
.
   
<EOS>
somebody
say
to
me
,
"
let
us
go
to
the
theatre
,
Copperfield
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
there
be
no
bedroom
before
me
,
but
again
the
jingling
table
cover
with
glass
;
the
lamp
;
<EOS>
Grainger
on
my
right
hand
,
Markham
on
my
left
,
and
Steerforth
opposite
---
all
sit
in
a
mist
,
and
a
long
way
off
.
 
<EOS>
the
theatre
?
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
the
very
thing
.
 
<EOS>
come
along
!
 
<EOS>
but
they
must
excuse
me
if
I
see
everybody
out
first
,
and
turn
the
lamp
off
---
in
case
of
fire
.
   
<EOS>
owe
to
some
confusion
in
the
dark
,
the
door
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
feel
for
it
in
the
window
-
curtain
,
when
Steerforth
,
laughing
,
take
me
by
the
arm
and
lead
me
out
.
 
<EOS>
We
go
downstairs
,
one
behind
another
.
 
<EOS>
near
the
bottom
,
somebody
fall
,
and
roll
down
.
<EOS>
somebody
else
say
it
be
Copperfield
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
angry
at
that
false
report
,
until
,
find
myself
on
my
back
in
the
passage
<EOS>
,
I
begin
to
think
there
may
be
some
foundation
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
a
very
foggy
night
,
with
great
ring
round
the
lamp
in
the
street
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
indistinct
talk
of
its
be
wet
.
 
<EOS>
I
consider
it
frosty
.
 
<EOS>
Steerforth
dust
me
under
a
lamp
-
post
,
and
put
my
hat
into
shape
,
which
somebody
produce
from
somewhere
in
a
most
extraordinary
manner
,
for
I
have
not
have
it
on
before
.
<EOS>
steerforth
then
say
,
"
You
be
all
right
,
Copperfield
,
be
you
not
?
"
<EOS>
and
I
tell
him
,
"
Neverberrer
.
"
   
<EOS>
a
man
,
sit
in
a
pigeon
-
hole
-
place
,
look
out
of
the
fog
,
and
take
money
from
somebody
,
inquire
if
I
be
one
of
the
gentleman
pay
for
,
and
appear
rather
doubtful
(
as
I
remember
in
the
glimpse
I
have
of
him
)
<EOS>
whether
to
take
the
money
for
me
or
not
.
<EOS>
shortly
afterwards
,
we
be
very
high
up
in
a
very
hot
theatre
,
look
down
into
a
large
pit
,
<EOS>
that
seem
to
me
to
smoke
;
the
people
with
whom
it
be
cram
be
so
indistinct
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
stage
,
too
,
look
very
clean
and
smooth
after
the
street
;
and
there
be
people
upon
it
,
talk
about
something
or
other
,
but
not
at
all
intelligibly
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
abundance
of
bright
light
,
and
there
be
music
,
and
there
be
lady
down
in
the
box
,
and
I
do
not
know
what
more
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
building
look
to
me
as

before

and
also
my
own
figure
at
full
length
in
a
glass
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
be
be
usher
into
one
of
these
box

and
find
myself
say
something
as
I
sit
down
,
and
people
about
me
cry
"
Silence

<EOS>
to
somebody
,
and
lady
cast
indignant

at
me

and

what

<EOS>
yes

<EOS>

<EOS>
Agnes

sit
on
the

before
me

in

with
a
lady

gentleman
beside
her

whom
I
do
not
know

<EOS>
I
see
her
face
now
,
well
than
I
do
then
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
with
its
indelible
look
of
regret
and
wonder
turn
upon
me
.
   
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
I
try

on
her
injunction
,
to
fix
it
,
and
to
hear
something
of
what
be
go
on
there
,
but
quite
in

<EOS>
I
look
at
her
again
by
and
by
,
and
see
her
shrink
into
her
corner
,
and
put
her
gloved

to

I
have
a
stupid

to
wait
,
to
hand
her
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
express
it
,
somehow
;
for
after
she
have
look
at
me
attentively
for
a
little
while
,
she
appear
to
understand
,
and
reply
in
a
low
tone
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
will
do
as
I
ask
you

if
I
tell
you
I

<EOS>
go
away
now
,

,
for
my
sake
,
and
ask
your

take
you
home

"
   
<EOS>
She
have
so
far
improve
me
,
for
the
time
,
that
though
I
be
angry
with
her
,
I
feel
ashamed
,
and
with
a
short
"
goori

"
<EOS>
(
which
I
intend
for
"
good
night

)
get
up
and
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
They
follow
,
and
I
step
at
once
out
of
the
box
-
door
into
my
bedroom
,
where
only
Steerforth
be
with
me
,
help
me
to
undress
,
and
where
I
be
by
turn
tell
him
that
Agnes
be
my
sister
,
and
adjure
him
to
bring
the
corkscrew
,
that
I
may
open
another
bottle
of
wine
.
   
<EOS>
how
somebody
,
lie
in
my
bed
,
lie
say
and
do
all
this
over
again
,
at
cross
purpose
,
in
a
feverish
dream
all
night
---
the
bed
a
rock
sea
that
be
never
still

<EOS>
how
,
as
that
somebody
slowly
settle
down
into
myself
,
do
I
begin
to
parch
,
and
feel
as
if
my
outer
covering
of
skin
be
a
hard
board
;
my
tongue
the
bottom
of
an
empty
kettle
,
fur
with
long
service
,
and
burn
up
over
a
slow
fire
;
the
palm
of
my
hand
,
hot
plate
of
metal
which
no
ice
could
cool
!
   
<EOS>
but
the
agony
of
mind
,
the
remorse
,
and
shame
<EOS>
I
feel
when
I
become
conscious
next
day
!
 
<EOS>
My
horror
of
have
commit
a
thousand
offence
I
have
forget
,
and
which
nothing
could
ever
expiate
---
my
recollection
of
that
indelible
look
which
Agnes
have
give
me
---
the
torturing
impossibility
of
communicate
with
her
,
not
know
,
Beast
that
I
be
,
how
she
come
to
be
in
London
,
or
where
she
stay

<EOS>
my
disgust
of
the
very
sight
of
the
room
where
the
revel
have
be
hold
---
my
racking
head
---
the
smell
of
smoke
,
the
sight
of
glass

the
impossibility
of
go
out
,
or
even
get
up
!
 
<EOS>
oh
,
what
a
day
it
be
!
   
<EOS>
oh
,
what
an
evening
,
when
I
sit
down
by
my
fire
to
a
basin
of
mutton
broth
,
dimple
all
over
with
fat
,
and
think
I
be
go
the
way
of
my
predecessor

and
should
succeed
to
his
dismal
story
as
well
as
to
his
chamber

and
have
half
a
mind
to
rush
express
to
Dover
and
reveal
all
!
 
<EOS>
what
an
evening
,
when
Mrs
Crupp
,
come
in
to
take
away
the
broth
-
basin
,
produce
one
kidney
on
a
cheese
-
plate
as
the
entire
remain
of
yesterday
's
feast
,
and
I
be
really
inclined
to
fall
upon
her
nankeen
breast
and
say
,
in
heartfelt
penitence
,
"
oh
,
Mrs
Crupp
,
Mrs
Crupp
,
never
mind
the
broken
meat
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
miserable
!
"
<EOS>

only
that
I
doubt
,
even
at
that
pass
,
if
Mrs
Crupp
be
quite
the
sort
of
woman
to
confide
in
!

out
at

on
the
morning
after
that
deplorable
day
of
headache
,
sickness
,
and
repentance
,
with
an
odd
confusion
in
my
mind
relative
to
the
date
of
my
dinner

party
,
as
if
a
body
of
Titans
have
take
an
enormous
lever
and
push
the
day
before
yesterday
some
month
back
,
when
I

a
ticket

porter
come
upstairs
,
with
a
letter
in
his
hand

<EOS>
He
be
take
his

when

he
swing
into

I

I
be
so

I
tell

he
believe
it

give
me
the
letter

an
answer

<EOS>
I
shut
him
out
on
the
landing
to
wait
for
the
answer
,
and
go
into
my
chamber
again
,
in
such
a
nervous
state
that
I
be
fain
to
lay
the
letter
down
on
my
breakfast
table
,
and
familiarize
myself
with
the
outside
of
it
a
little
,
before
I
could
resolve

break
the

partly

there
be
a
thrill

quite
subdue
me

I
sit

at
her

cast

down

still

Steerforth

darken

<EOS>
I
be
certain
that
what
I
say
be
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
quite
sure
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
it
be
someone
else
speak
to
you
,
and
not
I
,
when
I
caution
you
that
you
have
make
a
dangerous
friend
.
"
   
<EOS>
again
I
look
at
her
,
again
I
listen
to
her
after
she
be
silent
,
and
again
his
image
,
though
it
be
still
fix
in
my
heart
,
darken
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
so
unreasonable
as
to
expect
,
"
say
Agnes
,
resume
her
usual
tone
,
after
a
little
while
,
"
that
you
will
,
or
that
you
can
,
at
once
,
change
any
sentiment
that
have
become
a
conviction
to
you
;
least
of
all
a
sentiment
that
be
root
in
your
trusting
disposition
.
 
<EOS>
You
ought
not
hastily
to
do
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
ask
you
,
Trotwood
,
if
you
ever
think
of
me
---
I
mean
,
"
with
a
quiet
smile
,
for
I
be
go
to
interrupt
her
,
and
she
know
why
,
"
as
often
as
you
think
of
me

to
think
of
what
I
have
say

<EOS>
do
you
forgive
me
for
all
this
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
forgive
you

I
reply
,
"
when
you
come
to
do
Steerforth
justice
,

to
like
him
as
well
as
I
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
not
until
then
?
"
say
Agnes
.
   
<EOS>
I
see
a
pass
shadow
on
her
face
when
I
make
this
mention
of
him
,
but
she
return
my
smile
,
and
we
be
again
as
unreserved
in
our
mutual
confidence
as
of
old
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
when
,
Agnes
,
"
say
I
,
"
will
you
forgive
me
the
other
night
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
when
I
recall
it
,
"

Agnes
.
   
<EOS>
She
would
have
dismiss
the
subject
so
,
but
I
be
too
full
of
it
to
allow
that
,
and
insist
on
tell
her
how
it
happen
that
I
have
disgrace
myself
,
and
what
chain
of
accidental
circumstance
have
have
the
theatre
for
its
final
link
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
relief
to
me
to
do
this
,
and
to
enlarge
on
the
obligation
that
I
owe
to
Steerforth
for
his
care
of
me
when
I
be
unable
to
take
care
of
myself

<EOS>
"
You
must
not
forget

agne

calmly
change
the
conversation

soon

I
have
conclude

up

no

there
be
a
lady

certainly

at

who
be
very
clever

laugh
again
at
her
own
penetration

and
tell
me
that
if
I
be
faithful
to
her
in
my
confidence
she
think
she
should
keep
a
little
register
of
my
violent
attachment
,
with
the
date
,
duration
,
and
termination
of
each
,
like
the
table
of
the
reign
of
the
king

then
she
ask
me

on

that

lay
aside
her
work

fold
her
hand
upon
one
another

and
look
pensively
at
me
out
of
those
beautiful
soft
eye
of
her
:

"
I
believe
he
be
go
to
enter
into
partnership

<EOS>

what
?
 
Uriah

<EOS>
that
mean

fawn
fellow

himself
into

promotion

I
cry
,
indignantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
you
make
no
remonstrance
about
it
,
Agnes

<EOS>
consider
what
a
connexion
it
be
likely
to
be

<EOS>
You
must
speak
out

<EOS>
You
must
not

take
such
a

step

You

prevent
it

there

time

<EOS>
still
look
at
me
,
Agnes
shake
her
head
while
I
be
speak
,
with
a
faint
smile
at
my
warmth

and
then
reply
:
   
"
<EOS>
You
remember
our
last
conversation
about
papa

<EOS>
It
be
not
long
after
that

not
more
than
two
or
three
day

when
he
give
me
the
first
intimation
of
what
I
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
sad
to
see
him
struggle
between
his
desire
to
represent
it
to
me
as
a
matter
of
choice
on
his
part
,
and
his
inability
to
conceal
that
it

force
upon

very
sorry

force
it
upon

"
Uriah

,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
"
have
make
himself
indispensable
to

<EOS>
He
be
subtle
and
watchful

He
have
master
papa

weakness

foster
them

take
advantage
of

to

all
that
I

a
word

Trotwood
,
---
until
papa
be
afraid
of
him

"
   
<EOS>
there
be
more
that
she
may
have
say
;
more
that
she
know
,
or
that
she
suspect
;
I
clearly
see
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
give
her
pain
by
ask
what
it
be
,
for
I
know
that
she
withhold
it
from
me
,
to
spare
her
father

It
have
long
be
go
on

this

I
be
sensible

yes

I
could
not

feel
,
on
the
least
reflection
,
that
it
have
be
go
on
to
this
for
a
long
time

<EOS>
I
remain
silent

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
ascendancy
over
papa

say
agne

"
be
very
great
.
 
<EOS>
He
profess
humility
and
gratitude
---
with
truth
,
perhaps
:
I
hope
so
---
but
his
position
be
really
one
of
power
,
and
I
fear
he
make
a
hard
use
of
his
power
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
say
he
be
a
hound
,
which
,
at
the
moment
,
be
a
great
satisfaction
to
me

<EOS>
"
at
the
time
I
speak
of
,
as
the
time

papa
speak
to
me

pursue
agne

he
have
tell
papa
that
he
be
go
away

that
he

very
sorry

unwilling
to
leave

that
he
have
well
prospect

<EOS>
Papa
be
very
much
depressed
then
,
and
more
bow
down
by
care
than
ever
you
or
<EOS>
I
have
see
him
;
but
he
seem
relieved
by
this
expedient
of
the
partnership
,
though
at
the

time
he
seem
hurt
by
it

ashamed
of
it

Agnes

put
her
hand
before

tear

I
almost
feel
as

enemy

I
know

narrow
the
circle

duty

concentration

know
what
a

he
have
shut
out

how
his
anxious

of
me
have
shadow
his
life

weaken
his
strength

energy

by
turn
them
always
upon

I
could
ever
set
this
right

if
I

out

restoration

I
have
so
innocently
be
the
cause

his
decline

<EOS>
I
have
never
before
see
Agnes
cry

<EOS>
I
have
see
tear
in
her
eye
when
I
have
bring
new
honour
home
from
school
,
and
I
have
see
them
there
when
we
last
speak
about
her
father
,
and
I
have
see
her
turn
her
gentle
head
aside
when
we
take
leave
of
one
another
;
but
I
have
never
see
her
grieve
like
this

<EOS>
It
make
me
so
sorry
that
I
could
only
say
,
in
a
foolish

helpless
manner

"
pray
,
Agnes
,
do
not
!
<EOS>
do
not

my
dear
sister

<EOS>

Agnes
be
too
superior
to
me
in
character

purpose
,

I
know
well
now
,
whatever
I
may
know

not
know
then

to
be
long

the
beautiful

calm
manner

make
her
so
different

back
again

me
earnestly
entreat

to
be
friendly
to
Uriah

may

agne
have
no
time
to
say
more
,
for
the
room
door
open
,
and
Mrs
Waterbrook
,
who
be
a
large
lady
---
or
who
wear
a
large
dress
:
<EOS>
I
do
not
exactly
know
which
,
for
I
do
not
know
which
be
dress

which
be
lady
---
come
sail
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
dim
recollection
of
have
see
her
at
the
theatre
,
as
if
I
have
see
her
in
a
pale
magic
lantern
;
but
she
appear
to
remember
me
perfectly
,
and
still
to
suspect
me
of
be
in
a
state
of
intoxication
.
   
<EOS>
find
by
degree
,
however
,
that
I
be
sober
,
and
(
I
hope
)
<EOS>
that
I
be
a
modest
young
gentleman
<EOS>
,
Mrs
Waterbrook
soften
towards
me
considerably
,
and
inquire
,
firstly
,
if
I
go
much
into
the
park
,
and
secondly
,
if
I
go
much
into
society
.
 
<EOS>
on
my
replying
to
both
these
question
in
the
negative
,
it
occur
to
me
that
I
fall
again
in
her
good
opinion
;
but
she
conceal
the
fact
gracefully
,
and
invite
me
to
dinner
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
accept
the
invitation
,
and
take
my
leave
,
make
a
call
on
Uriah
in
the
office
as
I
go
out
,
and
leave
a
card
for
him
in
his
absence
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
go
to
dinner
next
day
,
and
on
the
street
door
be
open
,
plunge
into
a
vapour
-
bath
of
haunch
of
mutton
,
I
divine
that
I
be
not
the
only
guest
,
for
I
immediately
identify
the
ticket
-
porter
in
disguise
,
assist
the
family
servant
,
and
wait
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
to
carry
up
my
name
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
,
to
the
good
of
his
ability
,
when
he
ask
me
for
it
confidentially
,
as
if
he
have
never
see
me
before
;
but
well
do
I
know
him
,
and
well
do
he
know
me
.
 
<EOS>
Conscience
make
coward
of
us
both

<EOS>
I
find
Mr
Waterbrook
to
be
a
middle
-
aged
gentleman
,
with
a
short
throat
,
and
a
good
deal
of
shirt
-
collar
,
who
only
want
a
black
nose
to
be
the
portrait
of
a
pug
-
dog

<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
be
happy
to
have
the
honour
of
make
my
acquaintance
;
and
when
I
have
pay
my
homage
to
Mrs
Waterbrook
,
present
me
,
with
much
ceremony
,
to
a
very
awful
lady
in
a
black
velvet
dress
,
and
a
great
black
velvet
hat
,
whom
I
remember
as
look
like
a
near
relation
of
Hamlet

his
aunt

Mrs
Henry
Spiker
be
this
lady
's
name

her
husband
be
there
too

<EOS>
so
cold
a
man

that
his
head
,
instead
of

grey

seem
to

sprinkle
with
hoar

frost

<EOS>
immense
deference

male

solicitor

something

to
somebody

,
I
forget
what
or
which
,
remotely
connect
with
the
Treasury

<EOS>
I
find
Uriah
Heep
among
the
company
,
in
a
suit
of
black
,
and
in
deep
humility
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
when
I
shake
hand
with
him
,
that
he
be
proud
to
be
notice
by
me
,
and
that
he
really
feel
obliged
to
me
for
my
condescension
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
wish
he
have
be
less
obliged
to
me
,
for
he
hover
about
me
in
his
gratitude
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
;
and
<EOS>
whenever
I
say
a
word
to
Agnes
,
be
sure
,
with
his
shadowless
eye
and
cadaverous
face
,
to
be
look
gauntly
down
upon
us
from
behind
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
other
guest
---
all
ice
for
the
occasion
,
as
it
strike
me
,
like
the
wine

<EOS>
but
there
be
one
who
attract
my
attention
before
he
come
in
,
on
account
of
my
hearing

him
announce
as
Mr
Traddles
!
 
<EOS>
My
mind
fly
back
to
Salem
House
;
and
could
it
be
Tommy
,
I
think
,
who
use
to
draw
the
skeleton
!
   
<EOS>
I
look
for
Mr
Traddles
with
unusual
interest
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
sober
,
steady
-
look
young
man
of
retire
manner
,
with
a
comic
head
of
hair
,
and
eye
that
be
rather
wide
open
;
and
he
get
into
an
obscure
corner
so
soon
,
that
I
have
some
difficulty
in
make
him
out
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
I
have
a
good
view
of
him
,
and
either
my
vision
deceive
me
,
or
it
be
the
old
unfortunate
Tommy
.
   
<EOS>
I
make
my
way
to
Mr
Waterbrook
,
and
say
,
that
I
believe
I
have
the
pleasure
of
see
an
old
schoolfellow
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
"
say
Mr
Waterbrook
,
surprised
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
too
young
to
have
be
at
school
with
Mr
Henry
Spiker
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
do
not
mean
him
!
<EOS>
"
I
return
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
the
gentleman
name
Traddles
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
aye
,
aye
!
 
<EOS>
indeed
!
"
say
my
host
,
with
much
diminished
interest
.
 
<EOS>
"
possibly
.
"
   
"
if
it
be
really
the
same
person
,
"
say
I
,
glance
towards
him
,
"
it
be
at
a
place
call
Salem
House
where
we
be
together
,
and
he
be
an
excellent
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
yes
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
be
a
good
fellow
,
"
return
my
host
nod
his
head
with
an
air
of
toleration
.
 
<EOS>
"
Traddles
be
quite
a
good
fellow
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
curious
coincidence
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
really
,
"
return
my
host
,
"
quite
a
coincidence
,
that
traddle
should
be
here
at
all
:
as
Traddles
be
only
invite
this
morning
,
when
the
place
at
table
,
intend
to
be
occupy
by
Mrs
Henry
Spiker
's
brother
,
become
vacant
,
in
consequence
of
his
indisposition
.
 
<EOS>
a
very
gentlemanly
man
,
Mrs
Henry
Spiker
's
brother
,
Mr
Copperfield
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
murmur
an
assent
,
which
be
full
of
feeling
,
consider
that
I
know
nothing
at
all
about
him
;
and
I
inquire
what
Mr
Traddles
be
by
profession
.
   
<EOS>
"
traddle
,
"
return
Mr
Waterbrook
,
"
be
a
young
man

for
the
bar

<EOS>
yes
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
quite
a
good
fellow
---
<EOS>
nobody
's
enemy
but
his
own
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
be
he
his
own
enemy
?
"
<EOS>
say
I
,
sorry
to
hear
this
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
return
Mr
Waterbrook
,
purse
up
his
mouth
,
and
play
with
his
watch
-
chain
,
in
a
comfortable
,
prosperous
sort
of
way
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
he
be
one
of
those
man
who
stand
in
their
own
light
.
<EOS>
yes
,
I
should
say
he
would
never
,
for
example
,
be
worth
five
hundred
pound
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
be
recommend
to
me
by
a
professional
friend
.
 
<EOS>
oh
yes
.
 
<EOS>
yes
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
kind
of
talent
for
draw
brief
,
and
state
a
case
in
writing
,
plainly
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
able
to
throw
something
in
Traddles
's
way
,
in
the
course
of
the
year
;
something
---
for
him
---
considerable
.
 
<EOS>
oh
yes
.
 
<EOS>
yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
much
impress
by
the
extremely
comfortable
and
satisfied
manner
in
which
Mr
Waterbrook
deliver
himself
of
this
little
word
"
<EOS>
yes
"
,
every
now
and
then
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
wonderful
expression
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
completely
convey
the
idea
of
a
man
who
have
be
bear
,
not
to
say
with
a
silver
spoon
,
but
with
a
scaling
-
ladder
,
and
have
go
on
mount
all
the
height
of
life
one
after
another
,
until
now
he
look
,
from
the
top
of
the
fortification
,
with
the
eye
of
a
philosopher
and
a
patron
,
on
the
people
down
in
the
trench
.
   
<EOS>
My
reflection
on
this
theme
be
still
in
progress
when
dinner
be
announce
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Waterbrook
go
down
with
Hamlet
's
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Henry
Spiker
take
Mrs
Waterbrook
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
,
whom
I
should
have
like
to
take
myself
,
be
give
to
a
simper
fellow
with
weak
leg
.
<EOS>
Uriah
,
Traddles
,
and
I
,
as
the
junior
part
of
the
company
,
go
down
last
,
how
we
could
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
so
vexed
at
lose
Agnes
as
I
may
have
be
,
since
it
give
me
an
opportunity
of
make
myself
known
to
Traddles
on
the
stair
,
who
greet
me
with
great
fervour
;
while
Uriah
writhe
with
such
obtrusive
satisfaction
and
self
-
abasement
,
that
I
could
gladly
have
pitch
him
over
the
banister
.
<EOS>
traddle
and
I
be
separate
at
table
,
be
billet
in
two
remote
corner
:
he
in
the
glare
of
a
red
velvet
lady
;
I
,
in
the
gloom
of
Hamlet
's
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
the
dinner
be
very
long
,
and
the
conversation
be
about
the
aristocracy
---
and
blood
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Waterbrook
repeatedly
tell
us
,
that
if
she
have
a
weakness
,
it
be
blood
.
   
<EOS>
It
occur
to
me
several
time
that
we
should
have
get
on
well
,
if
we
have
not
be
quite
so
genteel
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
so
exceedingly
genteel
,
that
our
scope
be
very
limited
.
 
<EOS>
a
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Gulpidge
be
of
the
party
,
who
have
something
to
do
at
second
-
hand
(
at
least
,
Mr
Gulpidge
have
)
with
the
law
business
of
the
Bank
;
and
what
with
the
Bank
,
and
what
with
the
Treasury
,
we
be
as
exclusive
as
the
Court
Circular
.
 
<EOS>
to
mend
the
matter
,
Hamlet
's
aunt
have
the
family
fail
of
indulge
in
soliloquy
,
and
hold
forth
in
a
desultory
manner
,
by
herself
,
on
every
topic
that
be
introduce
.
<EOS>
these
be
few
enough
,
to
be
sure
;
but
as
we
always
fall
back
upon
blood
,
she
have
as
wide
a
field
for
abstract
speculation
as
her
nephew
himself
.
   
<EOS>
We
may
have
be
a
party
of
Ogres
,
the
conversation
assume
such
a
sanguine
complexion
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
confess
I
be
of
Mrs
Waterbrook
's
opinion
,
"
say
Mr
Waterbrook
,
with
his
wine
-
glass
at
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
other
thing
be
all
very
well
in
their
way
,
but
give
me
blood
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
,
"
observe
Hamlet
's
aunt
,
"
<EOS>
so
satisfactory
to
one
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
that
be
so
much
one
's
beau
-
ideal
of
---
of
all
that
sort
of
thing
,
speak
generally
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
some
low
mind
(
not
many
,
I
be
happy
to
believe
,
but
there
be
some
)
that
would
prefer
to
do
what
I
should
call
bow
down
before
idol
.
<EOS>
positively
idol
!
 
<EOS>
before
service
,
intellect
,
and
so
on
.
 
<EOS>
but
these
be
intangible
point
.
 
<EOS>
blood
be
not
so
.
 
<EOS>
We
see
blood
in
a
nose
,
and
we
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
meet
with
it
in
a
chin
,
and
we
say
,
"
there
it
be
!
 
<EOS>
that
be
blood
!
<EOS>
"
It
be
an
actual
matter
of
fact
.
 
<EOS>
We
point
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
It
admit
of
no
doubt
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
simper
fellow
with
the
weak
leg
,
who
have
take
agne
down
,
state
the
question
more
decisively
yet
,
I
think
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
you
know
,
deuce
take
it
,
"
say
this
gentleman
,
look
round
the
board
with
an
imbecile
smile
,
"
we
can
not
forego
blood
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
We
must
have
blood
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
some
young
fellow
,
you
know
,
may
be
a
little
behind
their
station
,
perhaps
,
in
point
of
education
and
behaviour
,
and
may
go
a
little
wrong
,
you
know
,
and
get
themselves
and
other
people
into
a
variety
of
fix
---
and
all
that
---
<EOS>
but
deuce
take
it
<EOS>
,
it
be
delightful
to
reflect
that
they
have
get
blood
in
'em
!
<EOS>
Myself
,
I
would
rather
at
any
time
be
knock
down
by
a
man
who
have
get
blood
in
him
,
than
I
would
be
pick
up
by
a
man
who
have
not
!
"
   
<EOS>
this
sentiment
,
as
compress
the
general
question
into
a
nutshell
,
give
the
utmost
satisfaction
,
and
bring
the
gentleman
into
great
notice
until
the
lady
retire
.
 
<EOS>
after
that
,
I
observe
that
Mr
Gulpidge
and
Mr
Henry
Spiker
,
who
have
hitherto
be
very
distant
,
enter
into
a
defensive
alliance
against
us
,
the
common
enemy
,
and
exchange
a
mysterious
dialogue
across
the
table
for
our
defeat
and
overthrow
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
affair
of
the
first
bond
for
four
thousand
five
hundred
pound
have
not
take
the
course
that
be
expect

Spiker

"
say
Mr
Gulpidge

<EOS>
"
do
you
mean
the
D
of
A%

"
say
Mr
Spiker
.
   
<EOS>
"
the
C
of
B

say
Mr
Gulpidge
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Spiker
raise
his
eyebrow
,
and
look
much
concerned
.
   
<EOS>
"
when
the
question
be

to
Lord

I

him

say
Mr

himself

Mr

nod

Mr

repeat
Mr

firmly

Mr

to
do
it

<EOS>
Mr
Spiker
be
so
interested
,
that
he
become
quite
stony
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
the
matter
rest
at
this
hour
,
"
say
Mr
Gulpidge
,
throw
himself
back
in
his
chair
.
 
<EOS>
"
Our
friend
Waterbrook
will
excuse
me
if
I
forbear
to
explain
myself
generally
,
on
account
of
the
magnitude
of
the
interest
involve
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Waterbrook
be
only
too
happy
,
as
it
appear
to
me
,
to
have
such
interest
,
and
such
name
,
even
hint
at
,
across
his
table
.
<EOS>
He
assume
an
expression
of
gloomy
intelligence
(
though
I
be
persuade
he
know
no
more
about
the
discussion
than
I
do
)
,
and
highly
approve
of
the
discretion
that
have
be
observe
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Spiker
,
after
the
receipt
of
such
a
confidence
,
naturally
desire
to
favour
his
friend
with
a
confidence
of
his
own
;
therefore
the
foregoing
dialogue
be
succeed
by
another
,
in
which
it
be
Mr
Gulpidge
's
turn
to
be
surprised
,
and
that
by
another
in
which
the
surprise
come
round
to
Mr
Spiker
's
turn
again
,
and
so
on
,
turn
and
turn
about
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
time
we
,
the
outsider
,
remain
oppress
by
the
tremendous
interest
involve
in
the
conversation
;
and
our
host
regard
us
with
pride
,
as
the
victim
of
a
salutary
awe
and
astonishment
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
glad
indeed
to
get
upstairs
to
Agnes
,
and
to
talk
with
her
in
a
corner
,
and
to
introduce
traddle
to
her
,
who
be
shy
,
but
agreeable
,
and
the
same
good
-
natured
creature
still
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
be
oblige
to
leave
early
,
on
account
of
go
away
next
morning
for
a
month
,
I
have
not
nearly
so
much
conversation
with
him
as
I
could
have
wish
;
but
we
exchange
address
,
and
promise
ourselves
the
pleasure
of
another
meeting
when
he
should
come
back
to
town
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
greatly
interested
to
hear
that
I
know
Steerforth
,
and
speak
of
him
with
such
warmth
that
I
make
him
tell
agne
what
he
think
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
Agnes
only
look
at
me
the
while
,
and
very
slightly
shake
her
head
when
only
I
observe
her
.
   
<EOS>
as
she
be
not
among
people
with
whom
I
believe
she
could
be
very
much
at
home
,
I
be
almost
glad
to
hear
that
she
be
go
away
within
a
few
day
,
though
I
be
sorry
at
the
prospect
of
part
from
her
again
so
soon
.
 
<EOS>
this
cause
me
to
remain
until
all
the
company
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
converse
with
her
,
and
hear
her
sing
,
be
such
a
delightful
reminder
to
me
of
my
happy
life
in
the
grave
old
house
she
have
make
so
beautiful
,
that
I
could
have
remain
there
half
the
night
;
but
,
have
no
excuse
for
stay
any
longer
,
when
the
light
of
Mr
Waterbrook
's
society
be
all
snuff
out
<EOS>
,
I
take
my
leave
very
much
against
my
inclination
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
then
,
more
than
ever
,
that
she
be
my
well
Angel
;
and
if
I
think
of
her
sweet
face
and
placid
smile
,
as
though
they
have
shine
on
me
from
some
remove
being
,
like
an
Angel
<EOS>
,
I
hope
I
think
no
harm
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
say
that
the
company
be
all
go
;
but
I
ought
to
have
except
Uriah
,
whom
I
do
not
include
in
that
denomination
,
and
who
have
never
cease
to
hover
near
us
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
close
behind
me
when
I
go
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
close
beside
me
,
when
I
walk
away
from
the
house
,
slowly
fit
his
long
skeleton
finger
into
the
still
long
finger
of
a
great
Guy
Fawkes
pair
of
glove
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
in
no
disposition
for
Uriah
's
company
,
but
in
remembrance
of
the
entreaty
Agnes
have
make
to
me
,
that
I
ask
him
if
he
would
come
home
to
my
room
,
and
have
some
coffee
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
really
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
he
rejoin
---
"
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mister
Copperfield
,
but
<EOS>
the
other
come
so
natural
,
I
do
not
like
that
you
should
put
a
constraint
upon
yourself
to
ask
a
numble
person
like
me
to
your
ouse
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
constraint
in
the
case
,
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
come
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
,
very
much
,
"
reply
Uriah
,
with
a
writhe
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
come
along
!
"
say
I.
   
I
could
not
help
be
rather
short
with
him
,
but
he
appear
not
to
mind
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
go
the
near
way
,
without
converse
much
upon
the
road
;
and
he
be
so
humble
in
respect
of
those
scarecrow
glove
,
that
he
be
still
put
them
on
,
and
seem
to
have
make
no
advance
in
that
labour
,
when
we
get
to
my
place
.
   
<EOS>
I
lead
him
up
the
dark
stair
,
to
prevent
his
knock
his
head
against
anything
,
and
really
his
damp
cold
hand
feel
so
like
a
frog
in
mine
,
that
I
be
tempt
to
drop
it
and
run
away
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
and
hospitality
prevail
,
however
,
and
I
conduct
him
to
my
fireside
.
<EOS>
when
I
light
my
candle
,
he
fall
into
meek
transport
with
the
room
that
be
reveal
to
him
;
and
when
I
heat
the
coffee
in
an
unassume
block
-
tin
vessel
in
which
Mrs
Crupp
delight
to
prepare
it
(
chiefly
,
I
believe
,
because
it
be
not
intend
for
the
purpose
,
be
a
shaving
-
pot
,
and
because
there
be
a
patent
invention
of
great
price
mouldering
away
in
the
pantry
)
,
he
profess
so
much
emotion
,
that
I
could
joyfully
have
scald
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
really
,
Master
Copperfield
,

I
mean
Mister
Copperfield

say
Uriah
,
"
to
see
you
wait
upon
me

what
I
never

,
one
way

another

so
many
thing
happen
to
me

I
never

I
be
sure

in
my

it

rain
blessing

You
have
hear
something

I
de

<EOS>
as
he
sit
on
my
sofa

with
his
long
knee
draw
up
under
his
coffee

cup
,
his
hat
and
glove
upon
the
ground
close
to
him

his
spoon
go
softly
round
and
round
,
his
shadowless
red
eye
,
which
look
as
if
they
have
scorch
their
lash
off
,
turn
towards
me
without
look
at
me
,
the
disagreeable
dint
I
have
formerly
describe
in
his
nostril
come
and
go
with
his
breath
,
and
a
snaky
undulation
pervade
his
frame
from
his
chin
to
his
boot

I
decide
in
my
own
mind
that
I
dislike
him
intensely
.
 
<EOS>
It
make
me
very
uncomfortable
to
have
him
for
a
guest
,
for
I
be
young
then
,

unused
to
disguise
what
I
so
strongly
feel

at

remember

you

<EOS>
something
in

lay
upon
the
kindling
of
those
spark
,

something
in
the
glance
he
direct
at
me
as
he

it

have
make
me
start
as

I

see
him
illuminate

light

<EOS>
recall
by
his
request
,
prefer
in
quite
another
tone
of
voice
,
I
do
the
honour
of
the
shaving

pot
;
but
I
do
them
with
an
unsteadiness
of
hand
,
a
sudden
sense
of
be
no
match
for
him
,
and
a
perplex
suspicious
anxiety
as
to
what
he
may

go
to

next

I

could
not
escape
his

say
nothing

He
stir
his
coffee
round

round

he
sip
it

feel
his
chin
softly
with
his
grisly
hand

he
look
at
the
fire

he
look
about
the
room

he
gasp
rather
than
smile
at
me

he
writhe

undulate
about

in
his
deferential
servility

stir

sip
again

leave
the
renewal

I
could
not

help
divide
that
part

sentence

without

take
his
crooked

off

be
quite
a
stranger

all

occur

next
,
take
possession
of
me
.
   
<EOS>
a
timely
observation
of
the
sense
of
power
that
there
be
in
his
face
,
do
more
to
bring
back
to
my
remembrance
the
entreaty
of
Agnes
,
in
its
full
force
,
than
any
effort
I
could
have
make
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
him
,
with
a
well
appearance
of
composure
than
I
could
have
think
possible
a
minute
before
,
whether
he
have
make
his
feeling
know
to
Agnes
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
no
,
Master
Copperfield
!
"
<EOS>
he
return
;
"
<EOS>
oh
dear
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
not
to
anyone
but
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
I
be
only
just
emerge
from
my
lowly
station
.
 
<EOS>
I
rest
a
good
deal
of
hope
on
her
observe
how
useful
I
be
to
her
father
<EOS>
(
for
I
trust
to
be
very
useful
to
him
indeed
,
Master
Copperfield
)
,
and
how
I
smooth
the
way
for
him
,
and
keep
him
straight
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
so
much
attach
to
her
father
,
Master
Copperfield
<EOS>
(
oh
,
what
a
lovely
thing
it
be
in
a
daughter
!
)
,
that
I
think
she
may
come
,
on
his
account
,
to
be
kind
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
fathom
the
depth
of
the
rascal
's
whole
scheme
,
and
understand
why
he
lay
it
bare
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
keep
my
secret
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
he
pursue
,
"
and
not
,
in
general
,
to
go
against
me
,
I
shall
take
it
as
a
particular
favour
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
not
wish
to
make
unpleasantness
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
a
friendly
heart
you
have
get
;
but
have
only
know
me
on
my
umble
footing
(
on
my
umblest
I
should
say
,
for
I
be
very
umble
still
)
,
you
may
,
unbeknown
,
go
against
me
rather
,
with
my
Agnes
.
 
<EOS>
I
call
her
mine
,
you
see
,
Master
Copperfield
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
song
that
say
,
"
I
would
crown
resign
,
to
call
her
mine
!
<EOS>
"
I
hope
to
do
it
,
one
of
these
day
.
"
   
<EOS>
Dear
agne
!
 
<EOS>
so
much
too
loving
and
too
good
for
anyone
that
I
could
think
of
,
be
it
possible
that
she
be
reserve
to
be
the
wife
of
such
a
wretch
as
this
!
   
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
hurry
at
present
,
you
know
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
Uriah
proceed
,
in
his
slimy
way
,
as
I
sit
gaze
at
him
,
with
this
thought
in
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
Agnes
be
very
young
still
;
and
mother
and
me
will
have
to
work
our
way
upwards
,
and
make
a
good
many
new
arrangement
,
before
it
would
be
quite
convenient
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
shall
have
time
gradually
to
make
her
familiar
with
my
hope
,
as
opportunity
offer
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
I
be
so
much
oblige
to
you
for
this
confidence
!
 
<EOS>
oh
,
it
be
such
a
relief
,
you
can
not
think
,
to
know
that
you
understand
our
situation
,
and
be
certain
(
as
you
would
not
wish
to
make
unpleasantness
in
the
family
)
not
to
go
against
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
take
the
hand
which
I
dare
not
withhold
,
and
have
give
it
a
damp
squeeze
,
refer
to
his
pale
-
faced
watch
.
   
<EOS>
"
dear
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
"
it
be
past
one
.
 
<EOS>
the
moment
slip
away
so
,
in
the
confidence
of
old
time
,
Master
Copperfield
,
that
it
be
almost
half
past
one
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
answer
that
I
have
think
it
be
later
.
 
<EOS>
not
that
I
have
really
think
so
,
but
because
my
conversational
power
be
effectually
scatter
.
   
<EOS>
"
dear
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
consider
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
ouse
that
I
be
stop
at

a
sort
of
a
private
hotel
and
boarding
ouse

Master
Copperfield
,
near
the
New
River

will
have
go
to
bed
these
two
hour

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
,
"
<EOS>
I
return
,
"
that
there
be
only
one
bed
here
,
and
that
I
---
"
   
"
oh
,
do
not
think
of
mention
bed
,
Master
Copperfield
!
"
<EOS>
he
rejoin
ecstatically
,
draw
up
one
leg
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
would
you
have
any
objection
to
my
lay
down
before
the
fire
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
if
it
come
to
that
,
"
I
say
,
"
pray
take
my
bed
,
and
I
will
lie
down
before
the
fire

"
   
<EOS>
His
repudiation
of
this
offer
be
almost
shrill
enough
,
in
the
excess
of
its
surprise
and
humility
,
to
have
penetrate
to
the
ear
of
Mrs
Crupp
,
then
sleep
,
I
suppose
,
in
a
distant
chamber
,
situate
at
about
the
level
of
low
-
water
mark
,
soothe
in
her
slumber
by
the
ticking
of
an
incorrigible
clock
,
to
which
she
always
refer
me
when
we
have
any
little
difference
on
the
score
of
punctuality
,
and
which
be
never
less
than
three
-
quarter
of
an
hour
too
slow
,
and
have
always
be
put
right
in
the
morning
by
the
good
authority
.
 
<EOS>
as
no
argument
I
could
urge
,
in
my
bewildered
condition
,
have
the
least
effect
upon
his
modesty
in
induce
him
to
accept
my
bedroom
,
I
be
oblige
to
make
the
good
arrangement
I
could
,
for
his
repose
before
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
the
mattress
of
the
sofa
(
which
be
a
great
deal
too
short
for
his
lank
figure
)
,
the
sofa
pillow
,
a
blanket
,
the
table
-
cover
,
a
clean
breakfast
-
cloth
,
and
a
great
-
coat
,
make
him
a
bed
and
covering
,
for
which
he
be
more
than
thankful
.
 
<EOS>
have
lend
him
a
night
-
cap
,
which
he
put
on
at
once
,
and
in
which
he
make
such
an
awful
figure
,
that
I
have
never
wear
one
since
,
I
leave
him
to
his
rest
.
   
<EOS>
I
never
shall
forget
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
shall
forget
how
I
turn
and
tumble
;
how
I
weary
myself
with
think
about
agne
and
this
creature
<EOS>
;
how
I
consider
what
could
I
do
,
and
what
ought
I
to
do
;
how
I
could
come
to
no
other
conclusion
than
that
the
good
course
for
her
peace
be
to
do
nothing
,
and
to
keep
to
myself
what
I
have
hear
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
go
to
sleep
for
a
few
moment
,
the
image
of
Agnes
with
her
tender
eye
,
and
of
her
father
look
fondly
on
her
,
as
I
have
so
often
see
him
look
,
arise
before
me
with
appeal
face
,
and
fill
me
with
vague
terror
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
awoke
,
the
recollection
that
Uriah
be
lie
in
the
next
room
,
sit
heavy
on
me
like
a
wake
nightmare
;
and
oppress
me
with
a
leaden
dread
,
as
if
I
have
have
some
mean
quality
of
devil
for
a
lodger
.
   
<EOS>
the
poker
get
into
my
doze
thought
besides
,
and
would
not
come
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
between
sleep
and
wake
,
that
it
be
still
red
hot
,
and
I
have
snatch
it
out
of
the
fire
,
and
run
him
through
the
body
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
haunted
at
last
by
the
idea
,
though
I
know
there
be
nothing
in
it
,
<EOS>
that
I
steal
into
the
next
room
to
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
there
I
see
him
,
lie
on
his
back
,
with
his
leg
extend
to
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
where
,
gurgling
take
place
in
his
throat
,
stoppage
in
his
nose
,
and
his
mouth
open
like
a
post
-
office
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
so
much
bad
in
reality
than
in
my
distemper
fancy
,
<EOS>
that
afterwards
I
be
attract
to
him
in
very
repulsion
,
and
could
not
help
wander
in
and
out
<EOS>
every
half
-
hour
or
so
,
and
take
another
look
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
the
long
,
long
night
seem
heavy
and
hopeless
as
ever
,
and
no
promise
of
day
be
in
the
murky
sky
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
see
him
go
downstairs
early
in
the
morning
(
for
,
thank
Heaven
!
<EOS>
he
would
not
stay
to
breakfast
)
,
it
appear
to
me
as
if
the
night
be
go
away
in
his
person
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
go
out
to
the
Commons
,
I
charge
Mrs
Crupp
with
particular
direction
to
leave
the
window
open
,
that
my
sitting
-
room
may
be
air
,
and
purge
of
his
presence
.

Chapter
26
.
<EOS>
I
fall
into
captivity
 
<EOS>
I
see
no
more
of
Uriah
Heep
,
until
the
day
when
Agnes
leave
town
.
<EOS>
I
be
at
the
coach
office
to
take
leave
of
her
and
see
her
go
;
and
there
be
he
,
return
to
Canterbury
by
the
same
conveyance
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
some
small
satisfaction
to
me
to
observe
his
spare
,
short
-
waiste
,
high
-
shouldered
,
mulberry
-
colour
great
-
coat
perch
up
,
in
company
with
an
umbrella
like
a
small
tent
,
on
the
edge
of
the
back
seat
on
the
roof
,
while
Agnes
be
,
of
course
,
inside
;
but
what
I
undergo
in
my
effort
to
be
friendly
with
him
,
while
agne
look
on
,
perhaps
deserve
that
little
recompense
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
coach
window
,
as
at
the
dinner
-
party
,
he
hover
about
us
without
a
moment
's
intermission
,
like
a
great
vulture
:
gorge
himself
on
every
syllable
that
I
say
to
Agnes
,
or
Agnes
say
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
state
of
trouble
into
which
his
disclosure
by
my
fire
have
throw
me
,
I
have
think
very
much
of
the
word
Agnes
have
use
in
reference
to
the
partnership
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
what
I
hope
be
right
.
<EOS>
feel
sure
that
it
be
necessary
for
papa
's
peace
that
the
sacrifice
should
be
make
,
I
entreat
him
to
make
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
a
miserable
foreboding
that
she
would
yield
to
,
and
sustain
herself
by
,
the
same
feeling
in
reference
to
any
sacrifice
for
his
sake
,
have
oppress
me
ever
since
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
how
she
love
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
the
devotion
of
her
nature
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
from
her
own
lip
that
she
regard
herself
as
the
innocent
cause
of
his
error
,
and
as
owe
him
a
great
debt
she
ardently
desire
to
pay
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
consolation
in
see
how
different
she
be
from
this
detestable
Rufus
with
the
mulberry
-
coloured
great
-
coat
,
<EOS>
for
I
feel
that
in
the
very
difference
between
them
,
in
the
self
-
denial
of
her
pure
soul
and
the
sordid
baseness
of
his
,
the
great
danger
lie
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
,
doubtless
,
he
know
thoroughly
,
and
have
,
in
his
cunning
,
consider
well
.
   
<EOS>
yet
I
be
so
certain
that
the
prospect
of
such
a
sacrifice
afar
off
,
must
destroy
the
happiness
of
Agnes
;
and
I
be
so
sure
,
from
her
manner
,
of
its
be
unseen
by
her
then
,
and
have
cast
no
shadow
on
her
yet
;
that
I
could
as
soon
have
injure
her
,
as
give
her
any
warning
of
what
impend
.
 
<EOS>
thus
it
be
that
we
part
without
explanation
<EOS>
:
she
wave
her
hand
and
smile
farewell
from
the
coach
window
;
her
evil
genius
writhe
on
the
roof
,
as
if
he
have
her
in
his
clutch
and
triumph
.
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
get
over
this
farewell
glimpse
of
them
for
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
when
Agnes
write
to
tell
me
of
her
safe
arrival
,
I
be
as
miserable
as
when
I
see
her
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
whenever
I
fall
into
a
thoughtful
state
,
this
subject
be
sure
to
present
itself
,
and
all
my
uneasiness
be
sure
to
be
redouble
.
 
<EOS>
hardly
a
night
pass
without
my
dreaming
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
become
a
part
of
my
life
,
and
as
inseparable
from
my
life
as
my
own
head
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
ample
leisure
to
refine
upon
my
uneasiness
:
for
Steerforth
be
at
Oxford
,
as
he
write
to
me
,
and
when
I
be
not
at
the
Commons
,
I
be
very
much
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
have
at
this
time
some
lurk
distrust
of
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
I
write
to
him
most
affectionately
in
reply
to
his
,
but
I
think
I
be
glad
,
upon
the
whole
,
that
he
could
not
come
to
London
just
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
suspect
the
truth
to
be
,
that
the
influence
of
Agnes
be
upon
me
,
undisturbed
by
the
sight
of
him
;
and
that
it
be
the
more
powerful
with
me
,
because
she
have
so
large
a
share
in
my
thought
and
interest
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
day
and
week
slip
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
article
to
Spenlow
and
Jorkins
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
ninety
pound
a
year
<EOS>
(
exclusive
of
my
house
-
rent
and
sundry
collateral
matter
)
from
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
My
room
be
engage
for
twelve
month
certain
:
and
though
I
still
find
them
dreary
of
an
evening
,
and
the
evening
long
,
I
could
settle
down
into
a
state
of
equable
low
spirit
,
and
resign
myself
to
coffee
;
which
I
seem
,
on
look
back
,
to
have
take
by
the
gallon
at
about
this
period
of
my
existence
.
 
<EOS>
at
about
this
time
,
too
,
I
make
three
discovery
:
first
,
that
Mrs
Crupp
be
a
martyr
to
a
curious
disorder
call
"
the
spazzum
"
,
which
be
generally
accompany
with
inflammation
of
the
nose
,
and
require
to
be
constantly
treat
with
peppermint
;
secondly
,
that
something
peculiar
in
the
temperature
of
my
pantry
,
make
the
brandy
-
bottle
burst
;
thirdly
,
that
I
be
alone
in
the
world
,
and
much
give
to
record
that
circumstance
in
fragment
of
english
versification
.
   
<EOS>
on
the
day
when
I
be
article
,
no
festivity
take
place
,
beyond
my
have
sandwich
and
sherry
into
the
office
for
the
clerk
,
and
go
alone
to
the
theatre
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
see
the
Stranger
,
as
a
Doctors
'
common
sort
of
play
,
and
be
so
dreadfully
cut
up
,
that
I
hardly
know
myself
in
my
own
glass
when
I
get
home
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
remark
,
on
this
occasion
,
when
we
conclude
our
business
,
that
he
should
have
be
happy
to
have
see
me
at
his
house
at
Norwood
to
celebrate
our
become
connect
,
but
for
his
domestic
arrangement
be
in
some
disorder
,
on
account
of
the
expect
return
of
his
daughter
from
finish
her
education
at
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
he
intimate
that
when
she
come
home
he
should
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
of
entertain
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
he
be
a
widower
with
one
daughter
,
and
express
my
acknowledgement
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
be
as
good
as
his
word
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
week
or
two
,
he
refer
to
this
engagement
,
and
say
,
that
if
I
would
do
him
the
favour
to
come
down
next
Saturday
,
and
stay
till
Monday
,
he
would
be
extremely
happy
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
I
say
I
would
do
him
the
favour
;
and
he
be
to
drive
me
down
in
his
phaeton
,
and
to
bring
me
back
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
day
arrive
,
my
very
carpet
-
bag
be
an
object
of
veneration
to
the
stipendiary
clerk
,
to
whom
the
house
at
Norwood
be
a
sacred
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
them
inform
me
that
he
have
hear
that
Mr
Spenlow
eat
entirely
off
plate
and
china
;
and
another
hint
at
champagne
be
constantly
on
draught
,
after
the
usual
custom
of
table
-
beer
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
clerk
with
the
wig
,
whose
name
be
Mr
Tiffey
,
have
be
down
on
business
several
time
in
the
course
of
his
career
,
and
have
on
each
occasion
penetrate
to
the
breakfast
-
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
He
describe
it
as
an
apartment
of
the
most
sumptuous
nature
,
and
say
that
he
have
drunk
brown
East
India
sherry
there
,
of
a
quality
so
precious
as
to
make
a
man
wink
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
an
adjourn
cause
in
the
Consistory
that
day
---
about
excommunicate
a
baker
who
have
be
object
in
a
vestry
to
a
pave
-
rate
---
and
as
the
evidence
be
just
twice
the
length
of
Robinson
Crusoe
,
accord
to
a
calculation
I
make
,
it
be
rather
late
in
the
day
before
we
finish
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
we
get
him
excommunicate
for
six
week
,
and
sentence
in
no
end
of
cost
;
and
then
the
baker
's
proctor
,
and
the
judge
,
and
the
advocate
on
both
side
(
who
be
all
nearly
relate
)
,
go
out
of
town
together
,
and
Mr
Spenlow
<EOS>
and
I
drive
away
in
the
phaeton
.
   
<EOS>
the
phaeton
be
a
very
handsome
affair
;
the
horse
arch
their
neck
and
lift
up
their
leg
as
if
they
know
they
belong
to
doctor
'
Commons
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
good
deal
of
competition
in
the
Commons
on
all
point
of
display
,
and
it
turn
out
some
very
choice
equipage
then
;
though
I
always
have
consider
,
and
always
shall
consider
,
that
in
my
time
the
great
article
of
competition
there
be
starch
:
which
I
think
be
wear
among
the
proctor
to
as
great
an
extent
as
it
be
in
the
nature
of
man
to
bear
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
very
pleasant
,
go
down
,
and
Mr
Spenlow
give
me
some
hint
in
reference
to
my
profession
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
it
be
the
genteel
profession
in
the
world
,
and
must
on
no
account
be
confound
with
the
profession
of
a
solicitor
:
be
quite
another
sort
of
thing
,
infinitely
more
exclusive
,
less
mechanical
,
and
more
profitable
.
<EOS>
We
take
thing
much
more
easily
in
the
Commons
than
they
could
be
take
anywhere
else
,
he
observe
,
and
that
set
us
,
as
a
privileged
class
,
apart
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
it
be
impossible
to
conceal
the
disagreeable
fact
,
that
we
be
chiefly
employ
by
solicitor
;
but
he
give
me
to
understand
that
they
be
an
inferior
race
of
man
,
universally
look
down
upon
by
all
proctor
of
any
pretension
.
   
<EOS>
I
ask
Mr
Spenlow
what
he
consider
the
good
sort
of
professional
business
?
 
<EOS>
He
reply
,
that
a
good
case
of
a
dispute
will
,
where
there
be
a
neat
little
estate
of
thirty
or
forty
thousand
pound
,
be
,
perhaps
,
the
good
of
all
.
 
<EOS>
in
such
a
case
,
he
say
,
not
only
be
there
very
pretty
picking
,
in
the
way
of
argument
at
every
stage
of
the
proceeding
,
and
mountain
upon
mountain
of
evidence
on
interrogatory
and
counter
-
interrogatory
(
to
say
nothing
of
an
appeal
lie
,
first
to
the
Delegates
,
and
then
to
the
Lords
)
,
but
,
the
cost
be
pretty
sure
to
come
out
of
the
estate
at
last
,
both
side
go
at
it
in
a
lively
and
spirited
manner
,
and
expense
be
no
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
he
launch
into
a
general
eulogium
on
the
Commons
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
to
be
particularly
admire
(
he
say
)
in
the
Commons
,
be
its
compactness
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
most
conveniently
organize
place
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
complete
idea
of
snugness
.
 
<EOS>
It
lie
in
a
nutshell
.
 
<EOS>
for
example
:
You
bring
a
divorce
case
,
or
a
restitution
case
,
into
the
Consistory
.
<EOS>
very
good
.
 
<EOS>
You
try
it
in
the
Consistory
.
 
<EOS>
You
make
a
quiet
little
round
game
of
it
,
among
a
family
group
,
and
you
play
it
out
at
leisure
.
 
<EOS>
suppose
you
be
not
satisfied
with
the
Consistory
,
what
do
you
do
then
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
you
go
into
the
Arches
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
Arches
?
 
<EOS>
the
same
court
,
in
the
same
room
,
with
the
same
bar
,
and
the
same
practitioner
,
but
another
judge
,
for
there
the
Consistory
judge
could
plead
any
court
-
day
as
an
advocate
.
<EOS>
well
,
you
play
your
round
game
out
again
.
 
<EOS>
still
you
be
not
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
very
good
.
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
do
then
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
you
go
to
the
Delegates
.
 
<EOS>
who
be
the
Delegates
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
the
Ecclesiastical
Delegates
be
the
advocate
without
any
business
,
who
have
look
on
at
the
round
game
when
it
be
play
in
both
court
,
and
have
see
the
card
shuffle
,
and
cut
,
and
play
,
and
have
talk
to
all
the
player
about
it
,
and
now
come
fresh
,
as
judge
,
to
settle
the
matter
to
the
satisfaction
of
everybody
!
 
<EOS>
discontented
people
may
talk
of
corruption
in
the
Commons
,
closeness
in
the
Commons
,
and
the
necessity
of
reform
the
Commons
,
say
Mr
Spenlow
solemnly
,
in
conclusion
;
but
when
the
price
of
wheat
per
bushel
have
be
high
,
the
Commons
have
be
busy
;
and
a
man
may
lay
his
hand
upon
his
heart
,
and
say
this
to
the
whole
world
,
---
<EOS>
"
touch
the
Commons
,
and
down
come
the
country
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
listen
to
all
this
with
attention
;
and
though
,
I
must
say
,
I
have
my
doubt
whether
the
country
be
quite
as
much
oblige
to
the
Commons
as
Mr
Spenlow
make
out
<EOS>
,
I
respectfully
defer
to
his
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
that
about
the
price
of
wheat
per
bushel
,
I
modestly
feel
be
too
much
for
my
strength
,
and
quite
settle
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
,
to
this
hour
,
get
the
well
of
that
bushel
of
wheat
.
<EOS>
It
have
reappear
to
annihilate
me
,
all
through
my
life
,
in
connexion
with
all
kind
of
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
now
,
exactly
,
what
it
have
to
do
with
me
,
or
what
right
<EOS>
it
have
to
crush
me
,
on
an
infinite
variety
of
occasion
;
but
whenever
I
see
my
old
friend
the
bushel
bring
in
by
the
head
and
shoulder
(
as
he
always
be
,
I
observe
)
,
I
give
up
a
subject
for
lose
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
a
digression
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
the
man
to
touch
the
Commons
,
and
bring
down
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
I
submissively
express
,
by
my
silence
,
my
acquiescence
in
all
I
have
hear
from
my
superior
in
year
and
knowledge
;
and
we
talk
about
the
Stranger
and
the
Drama
,
and
the
pair
of
horse
,
until
we
come
to
Mr
Spenlow
's
gate
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
lovely
garden
to
Mr
Spenlow
's
house
;
and
though
that
be
not
the
good
time
of
the
year
for
see
a
garden
,
it
be
so
beautifully
keep
,
that
I
be
quite
enchant
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
charming
lawn
,
there
be
cluster
of
tree
,
and
there
be
perspective
walk
that
I
could
just
distinguish
in
the
dark
,
arch
over
with
trellis
-
work
,
on
which
shrub
and
flower
grow
in
the
grow
season
.
 
<EOS>
"
here
Miss
Spenlow
walk
by
herself
,
"
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
"
dear
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
We
go
into
the
house
,
which
be
cheerfully
light
up
,
and
into
a
hall
where
there
be
all
sort
of
hat
,
cap
,
great
-
coat
,
plaid
,
glove
,
whip
,
and
walking
-
stick
.
 
<EOS>
"
where
be
Miss
Dora
?
"
say
Mr
Spenlow
to
the
servant
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dora
!
<EOS>
"
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
a
beautiful
name
!
"
   
<EOS>
We
turn
into
a
room
near
at
hand
(
I
think
it
be
the
identical
breakfast
-
room
,
make
memorable
by
the
brown
East
Indian
sherry
)
,
and
I
hear
a
voice
say
,
"
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
,
my
daughter
Dora
,
and
my
daughter
Dora
's
confidential
friend
!
<EOS>
"
It
be
,
no
doubt
,
Mr
Spenlow
's
voice
,
but
I
do
not
know
it
,
and
I
do
not
care
whose
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
all
be
over
in
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
fulfil
my
destiny
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
captive
and
a
slave
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
Dora
Spenlow
to
distraction
!
   
<EOS>
She
be
more
than
human
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
fairy
,
a
Sylph
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
know
what
she
be
---
<EOS>
anything
that
no
one
ever
see
,
and
everything
that
everybody
ever
want
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
swallow
up
in
an
abyss
of
love
in
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
pausing
on
the
brink
;
no
look
down
,
or
look
back
;
I
be
go
,
headlong
,
before
I
have
sense
to
say
a
word
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
,
"
observe
a
well
-
remember
voice
,
when
I
have
bow
and
murmur
something
,
"
have
see
Mr
Copperfield
before
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
speaker
be
not
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
no
;
the
confidential
friend
,
Miss
Murdstone
!
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
I
be
much
astonish
.
 
<EOS>
to
the
good
of
my
judgement
,
no
capacity
of
astonishment
be
leave
in
me
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
worth
mention
in
the
material
world
,
but
Dora
Spenlow
,
to
be
astonish
about
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
how
do
you
do
,
Miss
Murdstone
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
be
well
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
answer
,
"
very
well
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
how
be
Mr
Murdstone
?
"
<EOS>
She
reply
,
"
My
brother
be
robust
,
I
be
oblige
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
,
who
,
I
suppose
,
have
be
surprised
to
see
us
recognize
each
other
,
then
put
in
his
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
to
find
,
"
he
say
,
"
Copperfield
,
that
you
and
Miss
Murdstone
be
already
acquaint
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Copperfield
and
myself
,
"
say
Miss
Murdstone
,
with
severe
composure
,
"
be
connexion
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
once
slightly
acquaint
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
his
childish
day
.
 
<EOS>
circumstance
have
separate
us
since
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
know
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
reply
that
I
should
have
know
her
,
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
which
be
true
enough
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Murdstone
have
have
the
goodness
,
"
say
Mr
Spenlow
to
me
,
"
to
accept
the
office
---
if
I
may
so
describe
it
---
of
my
daughter
Dora
's
confidential
friend
.
 
<EOS>
My
daughter
Dora
have
,
unhappily
,
no
mother
,
Miss
Murdstone
be
oblige
enough
to
become
her
companion
and
protector
.
"
   
<EOS>
a
pass
thought
occur
to
me
that
Miss
Murdstone
,
like
the
pocket
instrument
call
a
life
-
preserver
,
be
not
so
much
design
for
purpose
of
protection
as
of
assault
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
I
have
none
but
pass
thought
for
any
subject
<EOS>
save
Dora
,
I
glance
at
her
,
directly
afterwards
,
and
be
think
that
I
see
,
in
her
prettily
pettish
manner
,
that
she
be
not
very
much
inclined
to
be
particularly
confidential
to
her
companion
and
protector
,
when
a
bell
rang
,
which
Mr
Spenlow
say
be
the
first
dinner
-
bell
,
and
so
carry
me
off
to
dress
.
   
<EOS>
the
idea
of
dress
one
's
self
,
or
do
anything
in
the
way
of
action
,
in
that
state
of
love
,
be
a
little
too
ridiculous
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
only
sit
down
before
my
fire
,
bite
the
key
of
my
carpet
-
bag
,
and
think
of
the
captivating
,
girlish
,
bright
-
eyed
lovely
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
form
she
have
,
what
a
face
<EOS>
she
have
,
what
a
graceful
,
variable
,
enchant
manner
!
   
<EOS>
the
bell
ring
again
so
soon
that
I
make
a
mere
scramble
of
my
dressing
,
<EOS>
instead
of
the
careful
operation
I
could
have
wish
under
the
circumstance
,
and
go
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
some
company
.
 
<EOS>
Dora
be
talk
to
an
old
gentleman
with
a
grey
head
.
<EOS>
Grey
as
he
be
---
and
a
great
-
grandfather
into
the
bargain
,
for
he
say
so
---
I
be
madly
jealous
of
him
.
   
<EOS>
what
a
state
of
mind
<EOS>
I
be
in
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
jealous
of
everybody
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
anybody
know
Mr
Spenlow
better
than
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
torture
to
me
to
hear
them
talk
of
occurrence
in
which
I
have
have
no
share
.
 
<EOS>
when
a
most
amiable
person
,
with
a
highly
polished
bald
head
,
ask
me
across
the
dinner
table
,
if
that
be
the
first
occasion
of
my
see
the
ground
,
I
could
have
do
anything
to
him
that
be
savage
and
revengeful
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
who
be
there
,
except
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
least
idea
what
we
have
for
dinner
,
besides
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
My
impression
be
,
that
I
dine
off
Dora
,
entirely
,
and
send
away
half
-
a
-
dozen
plate
untouched
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
next
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
talk
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
the
most
delightful
little
voice
,
the
gay
little
laugh
,
the
pleasantest
and
most
fascinating
little
way
,
that
ever
lead
a
lose
youth
into
hopeless
slavery
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
rather
diminutive
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
so
much
the
more
precious
,
I
think
.
   
<EOS>
when
she
go
out
of
the
room
with
Miss
Murdstone
(
no
other
lady
be
of
the
party
)
,
I
fall
into
a
reverie
,
only
disturb
by
the
cruel
apprehension
that
Miss
Murdstone
would
disparage
me
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
amiable
creature
with
the
polished
head
tell
me
a
long
story
,
which
I
think
be
about
gardening
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
hear
him
say
,
"
my
gardener
"
,
several
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
seem
to
pay
the
deep
attention
to
him
,
but
I
be
wander
in
a
garden
of
Eden
all
the
while
,
with
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
My
apprehension
of
be
disparage
to
the
object
of
my
engrossing
affection
be
revive
when
we
go
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
by
the
grim
and
distant
aspect
of
Miss
Murdstone
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
relieve
of
them
in
an
unexpected
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
David
Copperfield

say
Miss
Murdstone
,
beckon
me
aside
into
a
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
a

<EOS>
I
confront
Miss
Murdstone
alone

"
David

Miss
Murdstone
,
"
I
need
not

Miss

"
I
do
not

<EOS>
I
have
receive
outrage
from
a
person

a
female
I
be
sorry
to
say
,
for
the
credit
of
my
sex
---
who
be
not
to
be
mention
without
scorn
and
disgust
;
and
therefore
I
would
rather
not
mention
her
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
feel
very
fiery
on
my
aunt
's
account
;
but
I
say
it
would
certainly
be
well
,
if
Miss
Murdstone
please
,
not
to
mention
her

<EOS>
I
could
not
hear
her
disrespectfully
mention

I
add

<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
shut
her
eye
,
and
disdainfully
incline
her
head
;
then
,
slowly
open
her
eye
,
resume
:

<EOS>
David

I
shall
not

the
fact

an
unfavourable

It
may
have
be

you
may
have
cease

justify
it

<EOS>
that
be
not

question
between
us
now

<EOS>
I
belong
to
a

remarkable

for

I

I
incline

I

Family
circumstance
be
a
sufficient

it
be
quite
unnecessary

do
you
approve
of
this
?

Miss

I
return

I
think
you

use
me
very
cruelly

treat

I

Miss

shut

bend
her
head

just
touch

stiff

she

arrange

which
seem

be
the

set

in
exactly
the

state

as
when
I
have
see
her
last

<EOS>
these
remind
me
,
in
reference
to
Miss
Murdstone
's
nature
,
of
the
fetter
over
a
jail
door

suggest
on
the
outside

to
all
beholder

what
be
to
be
expect
within

<EOS>
all
I
know
of
the
rest

,
that
I
hear
the
empress

sing
enchant
ballad
in
the
french
language

generally
to
the
effect

<EOS>
that
when
Miss

take
her
into
custody
and
lead
her
away
,
she
smile
and
give
me
her
delicious
hand
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
catch
a
view
of
myself
in
a
mirror
,
look
perfectly
imbecile
and
idiotic
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
retire
to
bed
in
a
most
maudlin
state
of
mind
,
and
get
up
in
a
crisis
of
feeble
infatuation
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
fine
morning
,
and
early
,
and
I
think
I
would
go
and
take
a
stroll
down
one
of
those
wire

arched
walk
,

indulge
my
passion
by
dwell
on
her
image

<EOS>
on
my
way
through
the
hall
,
I
encounter
her
little
dog
,
who
be
call
Jip

short
for
Gipsy
.
<EOS>
I
approach
him
tenderly
,
for
I
love
even
him
;
but
he
show
his
whole
set
of
tooth
,
get
under
a
chair
expressly
to
snarl
,
and
would
not
hear
of
the
least
familiarity
.
   
<EOS>
the
garden
be
cool
and
solitary

<EOS>
I
walk
about
,
wonder
what
my
feeling
of
happiness
would
be
,
if
I
could
ever
become
engaged
to
this
dear
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
marriage
,
and
fortune
,
and
all
that
,
I
believe
I
be
almost
as
innocently
undesigne

as

I
love
little
em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
allow
to
call
her
"
Dora

to
write
to
her

to
dote
upon

worship
her
,
to
have
reason
to
think
that
when
she
be
with
other
people
she
be
yet
mindful
of
me
,
seem
to
me
the
summit
of
human
ambition
---
<EOS>
I
be
sure
it
be
the
summit
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
whatever
that
I
be
a
lackadaisical
young
spooney
;
but
there
be
a
purity
of
heart
in
all
this
,
that
prevent
my
have
quite
a
contemptuous
recollection
of
it
,
let
me
laugh
as
I
may
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
not
be
walk
long
,
when
I
turn
a
corner
,
and
meet
her
.
<EOS>
I
tingle
again
from
head
to
foot
as
my
recollection
turn
that
corner
,
and
my
pen
shake
in
my
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
You

out
early

I.
   
<EOS>
"
It

<EOS>
I
hazard
a

say
(
not

that

do
you

really
change

I
stammer
bad
than
before

I
mean
no

the
plain
truth
;

I
be
not

have
take
place
in
the

<EOS>
It

in

bashfully

to
clench
the
explanation

<EOS>
I
never

such
curl

how
could
I
,
for
there
never
be
such
curl

as
those

as

We
loiter
along

the

up

the

me

half
comical

I

in
two
slender

<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
have
be
look
for
us
.
 
<EOS>
She
find
us
here
;
and
present
her
uncongenial
cheek
,
the
little
wrinkle
in
it
fill
with
hair
powder
,
to
Dora
to
be
kiss
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
take
Dora
's
arm
in
hers
,
and
march
us
into
breakfast
as
if
it
be
a
soldier
's
funeral
.
   
<EOS>
how
many
cup
of
tea
I
drank
,
because
Dora
make
it
,
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
but
,
I
perfectly
remember
that
I
sit
swill
tea
until
my
whole
nervous
system
,
if
I
have
have
any
in
those
day
,
must
have
go
by
the
board
.
 
<EOS>
by
and
by
we
go
to
church
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
be
between
Dora
and
me
in
the
pew
;
but
I
hear
her
sing
,
and
the
congregation
vanish
.
 
<EOS>
a
sermon
be
deliver
---
about
Dora
,
of
course
---
and
I
be
afraid
that
be
all
I
know
of
the
service
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
a
quiet
day
.
 
<EOS>
no
company
,
a
walk
,
a
family
dinner
of
four
,
and
an
evening
of
look
over
book
and
picture
;
Miss
Murdstone
with
a
homily
before
her
,
and
her
eye
upon
us
,
keep
guard
vigilantly
.
 
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
little
<EOS>
do
Mr
Spenlow
imagine
,
when
he
sit
opposite
to
me
after
dinner
that
day
,
with
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
over
his
head
,
how
fervently
I
be
embrace
him
,
in
my
fancy
,
as
his
son
-
in
-
law
!
 
<EOS>
little
<EOS>
do
he
think
,
<EOS>
when
I
take
leave
of
him
at
night
,
that
he
have
just
give
his
full
consent
to
my
be
engage
to
Dora
,
and
that
I
be
invoke
blessing
on
his
head
!
   
<EOS>
We
depart
early
in
the
morning
,
for
we
have
a
Salvage
case
come
on
in
the
Admiralty
Court
,
require
a
rather
accurate
knowledge
of
the
whole
science
of
navigation
,
in
which
(
as
we
could
not
be
expect
to
know
much
about
those
matter
in
the
Commons
)
<EOS>
the
judge
have
entreat
two
old
Trinity
Masters
,
for
charity
's
sake
,
to
come
and
help
him
out
.
 
<EOS>
Dora
be
at
the
breakfast
-
table
to
make
the
tea
again
,
however
;
and
I
have
the
melancholy
pleasure
of
take
off
my
hat
to
her
in
the
phaeton
,
as
she
stand
on
the
door
-
step
with
Jip
in
her
arm
.
   
<EOS>
what
the
Admiralty
be
to
me
that
day
;
what
nonsense
I
make
of
our
case
in
my
mind
,
as
I
listen
to
it
;
how
I
see
"
dora
"
engrave
upon
the
blade
of
the
silver
oar
which
they
lie
upon
the
table
,
as
the
emblem
of
that
high
jurisdiction
;
and
how
I
feel
when
Mr
Spenlow
go
home
without
me
<EOS>
(
I
have
have
an
insane
hope
that
he
may
take
me
back
again
)
,
as
if
I
be
a
mariner
myself
,
and
the
ship
to
which
I
belong
have
sail
away
and
leave
me
on
a
desert
island
;
I
shall
make
no
fruitless
effort
to
describe
.
 
<EOS>
if
that
sleepy
old
court
could
rouse
itself
,
and
present
in
any
visible
form
the
daydream
I
have
have
in
it
about
Dora
,
it
would
reveal
my
truth
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
the
dream
that
I
dream
on
that
day
alone
,
but
day
after
day
,
from
week
to
week
,
and
term
to
term
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
there
,
not
to
attend
to
what
be
go
on
,
but
to
think
about
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
if
ever
I
bestow
a
thought
upon
the
case
,
as
they
drag
their
slow
length
before
me
,
it
be
only
to
wonder
,
in
the
matrimonial
case
(
remember
Dora
)
,
how
it
be
that
married
people
could
ever
be
otherwise
than
happy
;
and
,
in
the
prerogative
case
,
to
consider
,
if
the
money
in
question
have
be
leave
to
me
,
what
be
the
foremost
step
I
should
immediately
have
take
in
regard
to
Dora
.
<EOS>
within
the
first
week
of
my
passion
,
I
buy
four
sumptuous
waistcoat
---
not
for
myself
;
I
have
no
pride
in
them
;
for
Dora
---
and
take
to
wear
straw
-
colour
kid
glove
in
the
street
,
and
lay
the
foundation
of
all
the
corn
I
have
ever
have
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
boot
I
wear
at
that
period
could
only
be
produce
and
compare
with
the
natural
size
of
my
foot
,
they
would
show
what
the
state
of
my
heart
be
,
in
a
most
affect
manner
.
   
<EOS>
and
yet
,
wretched
cripple
as
I
make
myself
by
this
act
of
homage
to
Dora
<EOS>
,
I
walk
mile
upon
mile
daily
in
the
hope
of
see
her
.
<EOS>
not
only
be
I
soon
as
well
know
on
the
Norwood
Road
as
the
postman
on
that
beat
,
but
I
pervade
London
likewise
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk
about
the
street
where
the
good
shop
for
lady
be
,
I
haunt
the
Bazaar
like
an
unquiet
spirit
,
I
fag
through
the
Park
again
and
again
,
long
after
I
be
quite
knock
up
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
at
long
interval
and
on
rare
occasion
,
I
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
I
see
her
glove
wave
in
a
carriage
window
;
perhaps
I
meet
her
,
walk
with
her
and
Miss
Murdstone
a
little
way
,
and
speak
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
latter
case
I
be
always
very
miserable
afterwards
,
to
think
that
I
have
say
nothing
to
the
purpose
;
or
that
she
have
no
idea
of
the
extent
of
my
devotion
,
or
that
she
care
nothing
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
always
look
out
,
as
may
be
suppose
,
for
another
invitation
to
Mr
Spenlow
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
always
be
disappoint
,
for
I
get
none
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Crupp
must
have
be
a
woman
of
penetration
;
for
when
this
attachment
be
but
a
few
week
old
,
and
I
have
not
have
the
courage
to
write
more
explicitly
even
to
Agnes
,
than
that
I
have
be
to
Mr
Spenlow
's
house
,
"
whose
family
,
"
I
add
,
"
consist
of
one
daughter
"
;
---
I
say
Mrs
Crupp
must
have
be
a
woman
of
penetration
,
for
,
even
in
that
early
stage
,
she
find
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
She
come
up
to
me
one
evening
,
when
I
be
very
low
,
to
ask
(
she
be
then
afflict
with
the
disorder
I
have
mention
)
if
I
could
oblige
her
with
a
little
tincture
of
cardamum
mix
with
rhubarb
,
and
flavour
with
seven
drop
of
the
essence
of
clove
,
which
be
the
good
remedy
for
her
complaint
;
---
or
,
if
I
have
not
such
a
thing
by
me
,
with
a
little
brandy
,
which
be
the
next
good
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
<EOS>
,
she
remark
,
so
palatable
to
her
,
but
it
be
the
next
good
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
have
never
even
hear
of
the
first
remedy
,
and
always
have
the
second
in
the
closet
,
I
give
Mrs
Crupp
a
glass
of
the
second
,
which
(
that
I
may
have
no
suspicion
of
its
be
devote
to
any
improper
use
)
<EOS>
she
begin
to
take
in
my
presence
.
   
<EOS>
"
cheer
up
,
sir

"
say
Mrs
Crupp
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
abear
to
see
you
<EOS>
so

sir
:
I

a

myself

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
quite
perceive
the
application
of
this
fact
to
myself
,
but
I
smile
on
Mrs
Crupp
,
as
benignly
as
be
in
my
power

<EOS>
"
come

<EOS>
Mrs
Crupp
always
call
me
Mr
Copperfull
:
firstly
,
no
doubt
,
because
it
be
not
my
name
;
and
secondly
,
I
be
inclined
to
think
,
in
some
indistinct
association
with
a
washing
-
day
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
make
you
suppose
there
be
any
young
lady
in

I.

Mrs

with
a
great
deal
of
feeling

"
I

"
   
<EOS>
for
some
time
Mrs
Crupp
could
only
lay
her
hand
upon
her
nankeen
bosom
,
and
fortify
herself
against
return
pain
with
sip
of

Mrs

in

liberty

at

I

Tommy
Traddles
 
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
in
consequence
of
Mrs
Crupp
's
advice
,
and
,
perhaps
,
for
no
well
reason
than
because
there
be
a
certain
similarity
in
the
sound
of
the
word
skittle
and
Traddles
,
that
it
come
into
my
head
,
next
day
,
to
go
and
look
after
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
the
time
he
have
mention
be
more
than
out
,
and
he
live
in
a
little
street
near
the
Veterinary
College
at
Camden
Town
,
which
be
principally
tenant
,
as
one
of
our
clerk
who
live
in
that
direction
inform
me
,
by
gentleman
student
,
who
buy
live
donkey
,
and
make
experiment
on
those
quadruped
in
their
private
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
have
obtain
from
this
clerk
a
direction
to
the
academic
grove
in
question
,
I
set
out
,
the
same
afternoon
,
to
visit
my
old
schoolfellow
.
   
<EOS>
I
find
that
the
street
be
not
as
desirable
a
one
as
I
could
have
wish
it
to
be
,
for
the
sake
of
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
the
inhabitant
appear
to
have
a
propensity
to
throw
any
little
trifle
they
be
not
in
want
of
,
into
the
road
:
which
not
only
make
it
rank
and
sloppy
,
but
untidy
too
,
on
account
of
the
cabbage
-
leave
.
 
<EOS>
the
refuse
be
not
wholly
vegetable
either
,
for
I
myself
see
a
shoe
,
a
double
-
up
saucepan
,
a
black
bonnet
,
and
an
umbrella
,
in
various
stage
of
decomposition
,
as
I
be
look
out
for
the
number
I
want
.
   
<EOS>
the
general
air
of
the
place
remind
me
forcibly
of
the
day
when
I
live
with
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
an
indescribable
character
of
fade
gentility
that
attach
to
the
house
I
seek
,
and
make
it
unlike
all
the
other
house
in
the
street
---
though
they
be
all
build
on
one
monotonous
pattern
,
and
look
like
the
early
copy
of
a
blundering
boy
who
be
learn
to
make
house
,
and
have
not
yet
get
out
of
his
cramp
brick
-
and
-
mortar
pothook
---
remind
me
still
more
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber

to
arrive
at
the
door
as
it
be
open
to
the
afternoon
milkman
,
I
be
remind
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
more
forcibly
yet
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
"
say
the
milkman
to
a
very
youthful
servant
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
that
there
little
bill
of
mine
be
heerd
on
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
master
say
he
will
attend
to
it
immediate
,
"
be
the
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
because
,
"
say
the
milkman
,
go
on
as
if
he
have
receive
no
answer
,
and
speak
,
as
I
judge
from
his
tone
,
rather
for
the
edification
of
somebody
within
the
house
,
than
of
the
youthful
servant
---
an
impression
which
be
strengthen
by
his
manner
of
glare
down
the
passage
---
"
because
that
there
little
bill
have
be
run
so
long
,
that
I
begin
to
believe
it
be
run
away
altogether
,
and
never
will
not
be
heerd
of
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
I
be
not
a
go
to
stand
it
,
you
know
!
"
say
the
milkman
,
still
throw
his
voice
into
the
house
,
and
glare
down
the
passage
.
   
<EOS>
as
to
his
dealing
in
the
mild
article
of
milk
,
by
the
by
,
there
never
be
a
great
anomaly
.
 
<EOS>
His
deportment
would
have
be
fierce
in
a
butcher
or
a
brandy
-
merchant
.
   
<EOS>
the
voice
of
the
youthful
servant
become
faint
,
but
she
seem
to
me
,
from
the
action
of
her
lip
,
again
to
murmur
that
it
would
be
attend
to
immediate
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
,
"
say
the
milkman
,
look
hard
at
her
for
the
first
time
,
and
take
her
by
the
chin
,
"
be
you
fond
of
milk
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
I
like
it
,
"
she
reply
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
good
,
"
say
the
milkman
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
will
not
have
none
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
D'ye
hear
?
 
<EOS>
not
a
fragment
of
milk
<EOS>
you
will
not
have
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
think
she
seem
,
upon
the
whole
,
relieve
by
the
prospect
of
have
any
today
.
 
<EOS>
the
milkman
,
after
shake
his
head
at
her
darkly
,
release
her
chin
,
and
with
anything
rather
than
good
-
will
opened
his
can
,
and
deposit
the
usual
quantity
in
the
family
jug
.
<EOS>
this
done
,
he
go
away
,
muttering
,
and
utter
the
cry
of
his
trade
next
door
,
in
a
vindictive
shriek
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
Mr
traddle
live
here
?
<EOS>
"
I
then
inquire
.
   
<EOS>
a
mysterious
voice
from
the
end
of
the
passage
reply
"
yes
.
"
 
<EOS>
upon
which
the
youthful
servant
reply
"
yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
be
he
at
home
?
"
say
I.
   
again
the
mysterious
voice
reply
in
the
affirmative
,
and
again
the
servant
echo
it
.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
,
I
walk
in
,
and
in
pursuance
of
the
servant
's
direction
walk
upstairs
;
conscious
,
as
I
pass
the
back
parlour
-
door
,
that
I
be
survey
by
a
mysterious
eye
,
probably
belong
to
the
mysterious
voice
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
get
to
the
top
of
the
stair
---
the
house
be
only
a
story
high
above
the
ground
floor
---
Traddles
be
on
the
landing
to
meet
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
delighted
to
see
me
,
and
give
me
welcome
,
with
great
heartiness
,
to
his
little
room
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
front
of
the
house
,
and
extremely
neat
,
though
sparely
furnish
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
his
only
room
<EOS>
,
I
see
;
for
there
be
a
sofa
-
bedstead
in
it
,
and
his
blacking
-
brush
and
blacking
be
among
his
book
---
on
the
top
shelf
,
behind
a
dictionary
.
 
<EOS>
His
table
be
cover
with
paper
,
and
he
be
hard
at
work
in
an
old
coat
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
at
nothing
,
<EOS>
that
I
know
of
,
but
I
see
everything
,
even
to
the
prospect
of
a
church
upon
his
china
inkstand
,
as
I
sit
down
---
and
this
,
too
,
be
a
faculty
confirm
in
me
in
the
old
Micawber
time
.
 
<EOS>
various
ingenious
arrangement
he
have
make
,
for
the
disguise
of
his
chest
of
drawer
,
and
the
accommodation
of
his
boot
,
his
shaving
-
glass
,
and
so
forth
,
particularly
impress
themselves
upon
me
,
as
evidence
of
the
same
Traddles
who
use
to
make
model
of
elephant
'
den
in
writing
-
paper
to
put
fly
in
;
and
to
comfort
himself
under
ill
usage
,
with
the
memorable
work
of
art
I
have
so
often
mention
.
   
<EOS>
in
a
corner
of
the
room
be
something
neatly
cover
up
with
a
large
white
cloth
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
make
out
what
that
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
Traddles
,
"
say
I
,
shake
hand
with
him
again
,
after
I
have
sit
down
,
"
I
be
delighted
to
see
you

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
delighted
to

he
return
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
indeed
to
see
you

<EOS>
It
be
because
I
be
thoroughly
glad
to
see
you
when
we
meet
in
Ely
Place
,
and
be
sure
you
be
thoroughly
glad
to
see
me

that
I
give
you
this

instead

my
address
at
chamber

"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
chamber
?
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
have
the
fourth
of
a
room
and
a
passage
,
and
the
fourth
of
a
clerk
,
"
return
traddle
.
 
<EOS>
"
three
other
and
myself
unite
to
have
a
set
of
chamber

to
look
business

like

and
we
quarter
the
clerk
too
.
 
<EOS>
half
-
a
-
crown
a
week
he
cost
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
old
simple
character
and
good
temper
,
and
something
of
his
old
unlucky
fortune
also
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
smile
at
me
in
the
smile
with
which
he
make
this
explanation
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
because
I
have
the
least
pride
<EOS>
,
Copperfield
,
you
understand
,
"
say
Traddles
,
"
that
I
do
not
usually
give
my
address
here
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
on
account
of
those
who
come
to
me
,
who
may
not
like
to
come
here
.
 
<EOS>
for
myself
,
I
be
fight
my
way
on
in
the
world
against
difficulty
,
and
it
would
be
ridiculous
if
I
make
a
pretence

do
anything
else

"
You

It

out

He

indignantly

I
be
at

loss
what
to

however

I
begin

with
the
assistance

the
son

have
be
to
Salem
House

Yawler

no

He
have
not

all

<EOS>
"
It
do
not
matter
,
"
say
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
begin
,
by
mean
of
his
assistance
,
to
copy
law
writing
.
 
<EOS>
that
do
not
answer
very
well
;
and
then
I
begin
to
state
case
for
them
,
and
make
abstract
,
and
that
sort
of
work
.
 
<EOS>
for
I
be
a
plodding
kind
of
fellow
,
Copperfield
,
and
have
learn
the
way
of
do
such
thing
pithily
.
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
that
put
it
in
my
head

enter
myself

student

that
run
away

all
that
be
leave
of

fifty

recommend
me
to
one

Mr

get
a
good

job

I
be
fortunate
enough

too

become
acquainted

a
person

now

you

pleasant

not

without
show

some
mark

concern

that
he
be
sensible
of
sound
in

of

hurriedly
open

You

You

that
there
have

period
of

it
have
be
requisite

I

<EOS>
I
be
express
my
satisfaction

when
Mrs
Micawber
come
in
;
a
little
more
slatternly
than
she
use
to
be
,
or
so
she
seem
now
,
to
my
unaccustomed
eye
,
but
still
with
some
preparation
of
herself
for
company

with
a
pair
of
brown
glove
on

My

Mr

Copperfield

who
wish
to
renew

<EOS>
It
would
have
be
well
,
as
it
turn
out
,
to
have
lead
gently
up
to
this
announcement
,
for
Mrs
Micawber
,
be
in
a
delicate
state
of
health
,
be
overcome
by
it
,
and
be
take
so
unwell
,
that
Mr
Micawber
be
oblige
,
in
great
trepidation
,
to
run
down
to
the
water
-
butt
in
the
backyard
,
and
draw
a
basinful
to
lave
her
brow
with
.
 
<EOS>
She
presently
revive
,
however
,
and
be
really
pleased
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
half
-
an
-
hour
's
talk
,
all
together
;
and
I
ask
her
about
the
twin
,
who
,
she
say
,
be
"
grow
great
creature
"
;
and
after
Master
and
Miss
Micawber
,
whom
she
describe
as
"
absolute
giant
"
,
but
they
be
not
produce
on
that
occasion
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
be
very
anxious
that
I
should
stay
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
be
averse
to
do
so
,
but
that
I
imagine
I
detect
trouble
,
and
calculation
relative
to
the
extent
of
the
cold
meat
,
in
Mrs
Micawber
's
eye
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
plead
another
engagement
;
and
observe
that
Mrs
Micawber
's
spirit
be
immediately
lighten
,
I
resist
all
persuasion
to
forego
it
.
   
<EOS>
but
I
tell
Traddles
,
and
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
,
that
before
I
could
think
of
leave
,
they
must
appoint
a
day
when
they
would
come
and
dine
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
occupation
to
which
Traddles
stand
pledged
,
render
it
necessary
to
fix
a
somewhat
distant
one
;
but
an
appointment
be
make
for
the
purpose
,
that
suit
us
all
,
and
then
I
take
my
leave
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
,
under
pretence
of
show
me
a
near
way
than
that
by
which
I
have
come
,
accompany
me
to
the
corner
of
the
street
;
be
anxious
(
he
explain
to
me
)
to
say
a
few
word
to
an
old
friend
,
in
confidence
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My

Mr

"
I
need
hardly
tell
you

may
imagine

his

<EOS>
I
be
at
present
,
<EOS>
my
dear
Copperfield

engage
in
the
sale

It
be
not
an
avocation
of
a
remunerative
description

in
other
word

it
do
not
pay

some
temporary
embarrassment
of
a
pecuniary
nature

be
the
consequence

I
be
,
however

delighted
to
add
that
I
have
now

something
turn
up

I
be
not
at

I

will

permanently

both
for
myself

for
your
friend

in
whom
I
have
an
unaffected
interest

<EOS>
You
may
,
perhaps
,
be
prepare
to
hear
that
Mrs
Micawber
be
in
a
state
of
health
which
render
it
not
wholly
improbable
that
an
addition
may
be
ultimately
make
to
those
pledge
of
affection
which

in
short

the
infantine
group

<EOS>
Mrs
Micawber
's
family
have
be
so
good
as
to
express
their
dissatisfaction
at
this
state
of
thing

<EOS>
I
have
merely
to
observe
,
that
I
be
not
aware
that
it

that
I
repel

exhibition

scorn

defiance

Mr

<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
's
gauntlet
 
<EOS>
until
the
day
arrive
on
which
I
be
to
entertain
my
newly
-
find
old
friend
,
I
live
principally
on
Dora
and
coffee
.
 
<EOS>
in
my
love
-
lorn
condition
,
my
appetite
languish
;
and
I
be
glad
of
it
,
for
I
feel
as
though
it
would
have
be
an
act
of
perfidy
towards
Dora
to
have
a
natural
relish
for
my
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
the
quantity
of
walk
exercise
I
take
,
be
not
in
this
respect
attend
with
its
usual
consequence
,
as
the
disappointment
counteract
the
fresh
air
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
my
doubt
,
too
,
found
on
the
acute
experience
acquire
at
this
period
of
my
life
,
whether
a
sound
enjoyment
of
animal
food
can
develop
itself
freely
in
any
human
subject
who
be
always
in
torment
from
tight
boot
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
the
extremity
require
to
be
at
peace
before
the
stomach
will
conduct
itself
with
vigour
.
   
<EOS>
on
the
occasion
of
this
domestic
little
party
,
I
do
not
repeat
my
former
extensive
preparation
.
 
<EOS>
I
merely
provide
a
pair
of
sol
,
a
small
leg
of
mutton
,
and
a
pigeon
-
pie
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Crupp
break
out
into
rebellion
on
my
first
bashful
hint
in
reference
to
the
cooking
of
the
fish
and
joint
,
and
say
,
with
a
dignified
sense
of
injury
,
"
no
!
 
<EOS>
no
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
You
will
not
ask
me
sich
a
thing
,
for
you
be
better
acquaint
with
me
than
to
suppose
me
capable
of
do
what
I
can
not
do
with
ampial
satisfaction
to
my
own
feeling
!
"
<EOS>
but
,
in
the
end
,
a
compromise
be
effect
;
and
Mrs
Crupp
consent
to
achieve
this
feat
,
on
condition
that
I
dine
from
home
for
a
fortnight
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
and
here
I
may
remark
,
that
what
I
undergo
from
Mrs
Crupp
,
in
consequence
of
the
tyranny
she
establish
over
me
,
be
dreadful
.
<EOS>
I
never
be
so
much
afraid
of
anyone
.
 
<EOS>
We
make
a
compromise
of
everything
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
hesitate
,
she
be
take
with
that
wonderful
disorder
which
be
always
lie
in
ambush
in
her
system
,
ready
,
at
the
short
notice
,
to
prey
upon
her
vital
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
ring
the
bell
impatiently
,
after
half
-
a
-
dozen
unavaile
modest
pull
,
and
she
appear
at
last
---
which
be
not
by
any
mean
to
be
rely
upon
---
she
would
appear
with
a
reproachful
aspect
,
sink
breathless
on
a
chair
near
the
door
,
lie
her
hand
upon
her
nankeen
bosom
,
and
become
so
ill
,
that
I
be
glad
,
at
any
sacrifice
of
brandy
or
anything
else
,
to
get
rid
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
object
to
have
my
bed
make
at
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
---
which
I
do
still
think
an
uncomfortable
arrangement
---
one
motion
of
her
hand
towards
the
same
nankeen
region
of
wound
sensibility
be
enough
to
make
me
falter
an
apology
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
would
have
do
anything
in
an
honourable
way
rather
than
give
Mrs
Crupp
offence
;
and
she
be
the
terror
of
my
life
.
   
<EOS>
I
buy
a
second
-
hand
dumb
-
waiter
for
this
dinner
-
party
,
in
preference
to
re
-
engage
the
handy
young
man
;
against
whom
I
have
conceive
a
prejudice
,
in
consequence
of
meet
him
in
the
Strand
,
one
Sunday
morning
,
in
a
waistcoat
remarkably
like
one
of
mine
,
which
have
be
miss
since
the
former
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
the
"
young
gal
"
be
re
-
engaged
;
but
on
the
stipulation
that
she
should
only
bring
in
the
dish
,
and
then
withdraw
to
the
landing
-
place
,
beyond
the
outer
door
;
where
a
habit
of
sniff
she
have
contract
would
be
lose
upon
the
guest
,
and
where
her
retire
on
the
plate
would
be
a
physical
impossibility
.
   
<EOS>
have
lay
in
the
material
for
a
bowl
of
punch
,
to
be
compound
by
Mr
Micawber
;
have
provide
a
bottle
of
lavender

water
,
two

of
mixed
pin

and
a

to
assist
Mrs
Micawber
in
her
toilette
at
my
dressing

table
;
have
also
cause
the
fire
in
my
bedroom
to
be
light
for
Mrs
Micawber
's
convenience
;
and
have
lay
the
cloth
with
my
own
hand
,
I
await
the
result
with
composure
.
   
<EOS>
at
the
appoint
time
,
my
three
visitor
arrive
together
.

<EOS>
They
be
all
delighted
with
my
residence

<EOS>
when
I
conduct
Mrs

to
my
dressing

and
she
see
the
scale
on
which
it
be
prepared
for

she
be
in
such

that
she

<EOS>
My

say
Mr
Micawber

this
be
luxurious

<EOS>
this
be
a
way
of
life
which
remind
me
of
the
period
when
I
be
myself
in
a
state
of
celibacy

and
Mrs

have
not

He

My

return
Mr

with
sudden
seriousness

"
I
have
no
desire

I
be
too
well
aware
that
when

in
the
inscrutable
decree

Fate

you
be

it

you
may

destine

after
a
protract
struggle

at
length
to
fall
a
victim
to
pecuniary
involvement
of
a
complicated
nature

<EOS>
I
understand
your
allusion
,
my
love

<EOS>
I
regret
it
,
but
I
can
bear
it

"
   
<EOS>
"

exclaim
Mrs

,
in
tear
.
 
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
My

Mr

much
affected

you

the
momentary
laceration

with
a
ribald
Turncock
attach
to
the
water

work

and
will
pity
,
not
condemn
,
its
excess

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
then
embrace
Mrs
Micawber
,
and
press
my
hand
;
leave
me
to
infer
from
this
break
allusion
that
his
domestic
supply
of
water
have
be
cut
off
that
afternoon
,
in
consequence
of
default
in
the
payment
of
the
company
's
rate
.
   
<EOS>
to
divert
his
thought
from
this
melancholy
subject
,
I
inform
Mr
Micawber
that
I
rely
upon
him
for
a
bowl
of
punch
,
and
lead
him
to
the
lemon
.
 
<EOS>
His
recent
despondency
,
not
to
say
despair
,
be
go
in
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
a
man
so
thoroughly
enjoy
himself
amid
the
fragrance
of
lemon
-
peel
and
sugar
,
the
odour
of
burn
rum
,
and
the
steam
of
boiling
water
,
as
Mr
Micawber
do
that
afternoon
.
<EOS>
It
be
wonderful
to
see
his
face
shine
at
us
out
of
a
thin
cloud
of
these
delicate
fume
,
as
he
stir
,
and
mixed
,
and
taste
,
and
look
as
if
he
be
make
,
instead
of
punch
,
a
fortune
for
his
family
down
to
the
late
posterity
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
Mrs
Micawber
,
I
do
not
know
whether
it
be
the
effect
of
the
cap
,
or
the
lavender
-
water
,
or
the
pin
,
or
the
fire
,
or
the
wax
-
candle
,
but
she
come
out
of
my
room
,
comparatively
speak
,
lovely
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
lark
be
never
gay
than
that
excellent
woman
.
   
<EOS>
I
suppose
---
I
never
venture
to
inquire
,
but
I
suppose
---
that
Mrs
Crupp
,
after
fry
the
sol
,
be
take
ill
.
 
<EOS>
because
we
break
down
at
that
point
.
 
<EOS>
the
leg
of
mutton
come
up
very
red
within
,
and
very
pale
without
:
besides
have
a
foreign
substance
of
a
gritty
nature
sprinkle
over
it
,
as
if
if
have
have
a
fall
into
the
ashe
of
that
remarkable
kitchen
fireplace
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
be
not
in
condition
to
judge
of
this
fact
from
the
appearance
of
the
gravy
,
forasmuch
as
the
"
young
gal
"
<EOS>
have
drop
it
all
upon
the
stair
---
where
it
remain
,
by
the
by
,
in
a
long
train
,
until
it
be
wear
out
.
 
<EOS>
the
pigeon
-
pie
be
not
bad
,
but
it
be
a
delusive
pie
:
the
crust
be
like
a
disappointing
head
,
phrenologically
speak
:
<EOS>
full
of
lump
and
bump
,
with
nothing
particular
underneath
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
the
banquet
be
such
a
failure
that
I
should
have
be
quite
unhappy
---
about
the
failure
,
I
mean
,
for
I
be
always
unhappy
about
Dora
---
if
I
have
not
be
relieve
by
the
great
good
humour
of
my
company
,
and
by
a
bright
suggestion
from
Mr
Micawber
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
friend
Copperfield
,
"
say
Mr
Micawber
,
"
accident
will
occur
in
the
best
-
regulate
family
;
and
in
family
not
regulate
by
that
pervade
influence
which
sanctify
while
it
enhance
the
---
<EOS>
a
---
I
would
say
,
in
short
,
by
the
influence
of
Woman
,
in
the
lofty
character
of
Wife
<EOS>
,
they
may
be
expect
with
confidence
,
and
must
be
bear
with
philosophy
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
will
allow
me
to
take
the
liberty
of
remark
that
there
be
few
comestible
better
,
in
their
way
,
than
a
Devil
,
and
that
I
believe
,
with
a
little
division
of
labour
,
we
could
accomplish
a
good
one
if
the
young
person
in
attendance
could
produce
a
gridiron
,
I
would
put
it
to
you
,
that
this
little
misfortune
may
be
easily
repair
.
"
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
gridiron
in
the
pantry
,
on
which
my
morning
rasher
of
bacon
be
cook
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
it
in
,
in
a
twinkling
,
and
immediately
apply
ourselves
to
carry
Mr
Micawber
's
idea
into
effect
.
 
<EOS>
the
division
of
labour
to
which
he
have
refer
be
this
:
---
<EOS>
Traddles
cut
the
mutton
into
slice
;
Mr
Micawber
(
who
could
do
anything
of
this
sort
to
perfection
)
cover
them
with
pepper
,
mustard
,
salt
,
and
cayenne
;
I
put
them
on
the
gridiron
,
turn
them
with
a
fork
,
and
take
them
off
,
under
Mr
Micawber
's
direction
;
and
Mrs
Micawber
heat
,
and
continually
stir
,
some
mushroom
ketchup
in
a
little
saucepan
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
have
slice
enough
do
to
begin
upon
,
we
fall
-
to
,
with
our
sleeve
still
tuck
up
at
the
wrist
,
more
slice
sputter
and
blaze
on
the
fire
,
and
our
attention
divide
between
the
mutton
on
our
plate
,
and
the
mutton
then
prepare
.
   
<EOS>
what
with
the
novelty
of
this
cookery
,
the
excellence
of
it
,
the
bustle
of
it
,
the
frequent
start
up
to
look
after
it
,
the
frequent
sit
down
to
dispose
of
it
as
the
crisp
slice
come
off
the
gridiron
hot
and
hot
,
the
being
so
busy
,
so
flush
with
the
fire
,
so
amused
,
and
in
the
midst
of
such
a
tempting
noise
and
savour
,
we
reduce
the
leg
of
mutton
to
the
bone
.
 
<EOS>
My
own
appetite
come
back
miraculously
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
ashamed
to
record
it
,
but
I
really
believe
I
forget
Dora
for
a
little
while
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
satisfied
that
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
could
not
have
enjoy
the
feast
more
,
if
they
have
sell
a
bed
to
provide
it
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
laugh
as
heartily
,
almost
the
whole
time
,
as
he
eat
and
work
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
we
all
do
,
all
at
once
;
and
I
dare
say
there
be
never
a
great
success
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
at
the
height
of
our
enjoyment
,
and
be
all
busily
engage
,
in
our
several
department
,
endeavour
to
bring
the
last
batch
of
slice
to
a
state
of
perfection
that
should
crown
the
feast
,
when
I
be
aware
of
a
strange
presence
in
the
room
,
and
my
eye
encounter
those
of
the
staid
Littimer
,
stand
hat
in
hand
before
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
I
involuntarily
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
I
be
direct
to
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
be
my
master
not
here
,

<EOS>
"
no

<EOS>
"
have
you
not

him
,

no

do
not
you
come
from

not
immediately
so

do
he
tell
you
you
would
find
him
here
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
not
exactly
so
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
should
think
he
may
be
here
tomorrow
,
as
he
have
not
be
here
today
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
be
he
come
up
from
Oxford
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
,
sir
,
"
he
return
respectfully
,
"
that
you
will
be
seat
,
and
allow
me
to
do
this
.
"
 
<EOS>
with
which
he
take
the
fork
from
my
unresisting
hand
,
and
bent
over
the
gridiron
,
as
if
his
whole
attention
be
concentrate
on
it
.
   
<EOS>
We
should
not
have
be
much
discompose
,
I
dare
say
,
by
the
appearance
of
Steerforth
himself
,
but
we
become
in
a
moment
the
meek
of
the
meek
before
his
respectable
serving
-
man
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
,
hum
a
tune
,
to
show
that
he
be
quite
at
ease
,
subside
into
his
chair
,
with
the
handle
of
a
hastily
conceal
fork
stick
out
of
the
bosom
of
his
coat
,
as
if
he
have
stab
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Micawber
put
on
her
brown
glove
,
and
assume
a
genteel
languor
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
run
his
greasy
hand
through
his
hair
,
and
stand
it
bolt
upright
,
and
stare
in
confusion
on
the
table
-
cloth
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
I
be
a
mere
infant
at
the
head
of
my
own
table
;
and
hardly
venture
to
glance
at
the
respectable
phenomenon
,
who
have
come
from
Heaven
know
where
,
to
put
my
establishment
to
right
.
   
<EOS>
meanwhile
he
take
the
mutton
off
the
gridiron
,
and
gravely
hand
it
round
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
take
some
,
but
our
appreciation
of
it
be
go
,
and
we
merely
make
a
show
of
eat
it
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
severally
push
away
our
plate
,
he
noiselessly
remove
them
,
and
set
on
the
cheese
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
that
off
,
too
,
when
it
be
do
with
;
clear
the
table
;
pile
everything
on
the
dumb
-
waiter
;
give
us
our
wine
-
glass
;
and
,
of
his
own
accord
,
wheel
the
dumb
-
waiter
into
the
pantry
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
be
do
in
a
perfect
manner
,
and
he
never
raise
his
eye
from
what
he
be
about
.
 
<EOS>

He
be

softly

when
,
in
a
forlorn
hope
of
say
something
naturally

which
I
never

I
say
:

<EOS>
He
comprehend
everybody
present

in
the
respectful
bow
with
which
he
follow
these
word

disappear

<EOS>
My
visitor
seem
to
breathe
more
freely
when
he
be
go
;
but
my
own
relief
be
very
great
,
for
besides
the
constraint
,
arise
from
that
extraordinary
sense
of
be
at
a
disadvantage
which
I
always
have
in
this
man
's
presence
,
my
conscience
have
embarrass
me
with
whisper
that
I
have
mistrust
his
master
,
and
I
could
not
repress
a
vague
uneasy
dread
that
he
may
find
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
how
be
it
,
have
so
little
in
reality
to
conceal
<EOS>
,
that
I
always
do
feel
as
if
this
man

find
me
out

<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
rouse
me
from
this
reflection
,
which
be
blend
with
a
certain
remorseful
apprehension
of
see
Steerforth
himself
,
by
bestow
many
encomium
on
the
absent
Littimer
as
a
most
respectable
fellow
,
and
a
thoroughly
admirable
servant

<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
,
I
may
remark
,
have
take
his
full
share
of
the
general
bow
,
and
have
receive
it
with
infinite
condescension
.
   
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
it
be
at

in
high
flavour

<EOS>
My

will
you
give
me
your
opinion
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Micawber
pronounce
it
excellent
.
   
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
drink
,
"
say
Mr
Micawber
,
"
if
my
friend
Copperfield

permit

to
take
that

fight
our

<EOS>
I
may
say
,
of
myself

Copperfield
,
in
word
we
have
sing
together
before

that
   
<EOS>
"
We

run
about
the
brae

a
figurative
point
of
view
---
on
several
occasion

<EOS>
I
be
not
exactly
aware

"
say
Mr
Micawber
,
with
the
old
roll
in
his
voice
,
and
the
old
indescribable
air
of
say
something
genteel
,
"
what
gowan
may
be
,
but
I
have
no
doubt
that
Copperfield
and
myself
would
frequently
have
take
a
pull
at
them
,
if
it
have
be
feasible
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
,
at
the
then
present
moment
,
take
a
pull
at
his
punch
.
<EOS>
so
we
all
do
:
<EOS>
Traddles
evidently
lose
in
wonder
at
what
distant
time
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
<EOS>
and
I
could
have
be
comrade
in
the
battle
of
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
"
ahem
!
<EOS>
"
say
Mr
Micawber
,
clear
his
throat
,
and
warm
with
the
punch
and
with
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
another
glass
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Micawber
say
it
must
be
very
little
;
but
we
could
not
allow
that
,
so
it
be
a
glassful
.
   
<EOS>
"
as
we
be
quite
confidential
here
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
say
Mrs
Micawber
,
sip
her
punch
,
"
Mr
Traddles
be
a
part
of
our
domesticity
<EOS>
,
I
should
much
like
to
have
your
opinion
on
Mr
Micawber
's
prospect
.
 
<EOS>
for
corn
,
"
say
Mrs
Micawber
argumentatively
,
"
as
I
have
repeatedly
say
to
Mr
Micawber
,
may
be
gentlemanly
,
but
it
be
not
remunerative
.
 
<EOS>
Commission
to
the
extent
of
two
and
ninepence
in
a
fortnight
can
not
,
however
limit
our
idea
,
be
consider
remunerative
.
"
   
<EOS>
We
be
all
agree
upon
that
.
   
<EOS>
"
then
,
"
say
Mrs
Micawber
,
who
pride
herself
on
take
a
clear
view
of
thing
,
and
keep
Mr
Micawber
straight
by
her
woman
's
wisdom
,
when
he
may
otherwise
go
a
little
crooked
,
"
then
I
ask
myself
this
question
.
 
<EOS>
if
corn
be
not
to
be
rely
upon
,
what
be
?
<EOS>
be
coal
to
be
rely
upon
?
 
<EOS>
not
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
turn
our
attention
to
that
experiment
,
on
the
suggestion
of
my
family
,
and
we
find
it
fallacious
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
,
lean
back
in
his
chair
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
eye
us
aside
,
and
nod
his
head
,
as
much
as
to
say
that
the
case
be
very
clearly
put
.
   
<EOS>
"
the
article
of
corn
and
coal
,
"
say
Mrs
Micawber
,
still
more
argumentatively
,
"
be
equally
out
of
the
question
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
I
naturally
look
round
the
world
,
and
say
,
"
what
be
there
in
which
a
person
of
Mr
Micawber
's
talent
be
likely
to
succeed
?
"
<EOS>
and
I
exclude
the
do
anything
on
commission
,
because
commission
be
not
a
certainty
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
best
suited
to
a
person
of
Mr
Micawber
's
peculiar
temperament
be
,
I
be
convince
,
a
certainty
.
"
   
<EOS>
traddle
and
I
both
express
,
by
a
feeling
murmur
,
that
this
great
discovery
be
no
doubt
true
of
Mr
Micawber
,
and
that
it
do
him
much
credit
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
conceal
from
you
,
my
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
say
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
that
I
have
long
feel
the
Brewing
business
to
be
particularly
adapt
to
Mr
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
look
at
Barclay
and
Perkins
!
<EOS>
look
at
Truman
,
Hanbury
,
and
Buxton
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
on
that
extensive
footing
that
Mr
Micawber
,
I
know
from
my
own
knowledge
of
him
,
be
calculate
to
shine
;
and
the
profit
,
I
be
tell
,
be

<EOS>
but
if
Mr
Micawber
can
not
get
into
those
firm
---
which
decline
to
answer
his
letter
,
when
he
offer
his
service
even
in
an
inferior
capacity

what
be
the
use
of
dwell
upon
that
idea
?
 
<EOS>
none

<EOS>
I
may
have
a
conviction
that
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
's
manner
---
"
   
"
Hem
!
 
<EOS>
really
,
my
dear
,
"
interpose
Mr
Micawber
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
be
silent
,
"
say
Mrs
Micawber
,
lay
her
brown
glove
on
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
may
have
a
conviction
,
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
,
that
Mr
Micawber
's
manner
peculiarly
qualify
him
for
the
Banking
business
.
<EOS>
I
may
argue
within
myself
,
that
if
I
have
a
deposit
at
a
banking
-
house
,
the
manner
of
Mr
Micawber
,
as
represent
that
banking
-
house
,
would
inspire
confidence
,
and
must
extend
the
connexion
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
the
various
banking
-
house
refuse
to
avail
themselves
of
Mr
Micawber
's
ability
,
or
receive
the
offer
of
them
with
contumely
,
what
be
the
use
of
dwell
upon
that
idea
?
<EOS>
none
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
originate
a
banking
-
business
,
I
may
know
that
there
be
member
of
my
family
who
,
if
they
choose
to
place
their
money
in
Mr
Micawber
's
hand
,
may
find
an
establishment
of
that
description
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
they
do
not
choose
to
place
their
money
in
Mr
Micawber
's
hand
---
which
they
do
not
---
what
be
the
use
of
that
?
<EOS>
again
I
contend
that
we
be
no
farther
advanced
than
we
be
before
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
shake
my
head
,
and
say
,
"
not
a
bit
.
"
 
<EOS>
Traddles
also
shake
his
head
,
and
say
,
"
not
a
bit
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
what
do
I
deduce
from
this
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Micawber
go
on
to
say
,
still
with
the
same
air
of
put
a
case
lucidly
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
conclusion
,
my
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
to
which
I
be
irresistibly
bring
?
 
<EOS>
be
I
wrong
in
say
<EOS>
,
it
be
clear
that
we
must
live
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
answer
"
not
at
all
!
"
<EOS>
and
traddle
answer
"
not
at
all
!
"
<EOS>
and
I
find
myself
afterwards
sagely
add
,
alone
,
that
a
person
must
either
live
or
die
.
   
<EOS>
"
just
so
,
"
return
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
It
be
precisely
that
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
fact
be
,
my
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
that
we
can
not
live
without
something
widely
different
from
exist
circumstance
shortly
turn
up
.
 
<EOS>
now
I
be
convinced
,
myself
,
and
<EOS>
this
I
have
point
out
to
Mr
Micawber
several
time
of
late
,
that
thing
can
not
be
expect
to
turn
up
of
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
,
in
a
measure
,
assist
to
turn
them
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
be
wrong
,
but
I
have
form
that
opinion
.
"
   
<EOS>
both
Traddles
and
I
applaud
it
highly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
very
well
,
"
say
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
what
do
I
recommend
?
 
<EOS>
here
be
Mr
Micawber
with
a
variety
of
qualification

with
great
talent

"
really
,
my
love

Mr
Micawber

<EOS>

pray
,
my

allow
me
to
conclude

here

of
qualification

with
great
talent

genius

the
partiality

I
both
murmur

no

"
<EOS>
and
here
be
Mr
Micawber
without
any
suitable
position
or
employment
.
 
<EOS>
where
do
that
responsibility
rest
?
 
<EOS>
clearly
on
society

then
I
would
make
a
fact
so
disgraceful
know

and
boldly
challenge
society
to
set
it
right

<EOS>
It
appear
to
me
,
my
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
say
Mrs
Micawber
,
forcibly
,
"
that
what
Mr
Micawber
have
to
do
,
be
to
throw
down
the
gauntlet
to
society
,
and
say
,
in
effect
,
"
show
me
who
will
take
that
up

<EOS>
let
the
party
immediately
step
forward

"
   
I
venture
to
ask
Mrs
Micawber
how
this
be
to
be
do
.
   
<EOS>

by
advertising
,
"
say
Mrs
Micawber
---

in
all
the
paper

<EOS>
It
appear
to
me
,
that
what
Mr
Micawber
have
to
do
,
in
justice
to
himself
,
in
justice
to
his
family
,
and
I
will
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
in
justice
to
society
,
by
which
he
have
be
hitherto
overlook
,
be
to
advertise
in
all
the
paper
;
to
describe
himself
plainly
as
so
-
and
-
so
,
with
such
and
such
qualification
and
to
put
it
thus
:
"
<EOS>
now
employ
me
,
on
remunerative
term
,
and
address
,
post
-
pay
,
to
w*m
,
Post
Office
,
Camden
Town

"
<EOS>
"
   
"
this
idea
of
Mrs

,
my

say
Mr

make
his
shirt

sideways

dubiously

quite
true

I
have
make
the
identical
observation
to
Mr

<EOS>
It
be
for
that
reason
especially
,
that
I
think
Mr
Micawber
ought
(
as
I
have
already
say
,
in
justice
to
himself
,
in
justice
to
his
family

in

<EOS>
Mr

lean
back
in
his

trifle
with
his
eye

glass

cast
his
eye
up
at
the
ceiling
;

I
think
him
observant
of
Traddles
,
too

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
if
no
member
of
my
family
,
"
say
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
be
possess
of
sufficient
natural
feeling
to
negotiate
that
bill
<EOS>
---
I
believe
there
be
a
well
business
-
term
to
express
what
I
mean
---
"
   
Mr
Micawber
,
with
his
eye
still
cast
up
at
the
ceiling
,
suggest
"
Discount
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
to
discount
that
bill
,
"
say
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
then
my
opinion
be
,
that
Mr
Micawber
should
go
into
the
City
,
should
take
that
bill
into
the
Money
market
,
and
should
dispose
of
it
for
what
he
can
get
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
individual
in
the
Money
Market
oblige
Mr
Micawber
to
sustain
a
great
sacrifice
,
that
be
between
themselves
and
their
conscience
.
 
<EOS>
I
view
it
,
steadily
,
as
an
investment
.
 
<EOS>
I
recommend
Mr
Micawber
,
my
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
to
do
the
same
;
to
regard
it
as
an
investment
which
be
sure
of
return
,
and
to
make
up
his
mind
to
any
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
feel
,
but
I
be
sure
I
do
not
know
why
,
that
this
be
self
-
deny
and
devote
in
Mrs
Micawber
,
and
I
utter
a
murmur
to
that
effect
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
,
who
take
his
tone
from
me
,
do
likewise
,
still
look
at
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
,
"
say
Mrs
Micawber
,
finish
her
punch
,
and
gather
her
scarf
about
her
shoulder
,
preparatory
to
her
withdrawal
to
my
bedroom
:
"
I
will
not
protract
these
remark
on
the
subject
of
Mr
Micawber
's
pecuniary
affair
.
 
<EOS>
at
your
fireside
,
my
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
and
in
the
presence
of
Mr
Traddles
,
who
,
though
not
so
old
a
friend
,
be
quite
one
of
ourselves
,
I
could
not
refrain
from
make
you
acquaint
with
the
course
I
advise
Mr
Micawber
to
take
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
that
the
time
be
arrive
when
Mr
Micawber
should
exert
himself
<EOS>
and
---
I
will
add
---
assert
himself
,
and
it
appear
to
me
that
these
be
the
mean
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
aware
that
I
be
merely
a
female
,
and
that
a
masculine
judgement
be
usually
consider
more
competent
to
the
discussion
of
such
question
;
still
I
must
not
forget
that
,
when
I
live
at
home
with
my
papa
and
mama
,
my
papa
be
in
the
habit
of
say
,
"
Emma
's
form
be
fragile
,
but
her
grasp
of
a
subject
be
inferior
to
none
.
<EOS>
"
that
my
papa
be
too
partial
,
I
well
know
;
but
that
he
be
an
observer
of
character
in
some
degree
,
my
duty
and
my
reason
equally
forbid
me
to
doubt
.
"
   
<EOS>
with
these
word
,
and
resist
our
entreaty
that
she
would
grace
the
remain
circulation
of
the
punch
with
her
presence
,
Mrs
Micawber
retire
to
my
bedroom
.
 
<EOS>
and
really
I
feel
that
she
be
a
noble
woman
---
the
sort
of
woman
who
may
have
be
a
roman
matron
,
and
do
all
manner
of
heroic
thing
,
in
time
of
public
trouble
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
fervour
of
this
impression
,
I
congratulate
Mr
Micawber
on
the
treasure
he
possess
.
 
<EOS>
so
do
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
extend
his
hand
to
each
of
us
in
succession
,
and
then
cover
his
face
with
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
which
I
think
have
more
snuff
upon
it
than
he
be
aware
of
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
return
to
the
punch
,
in
the
high
state
of
exhilaration
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
full
of
eloquence
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
us
to
understand
that
in
our
child
we
live
again
,
and
that
,
under
the
pressure
of
pecuniary
difficulty
,
any
accession
to
their
number
be
doubly
welcome
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
that
Mrs
Micawber
have
latterly
have
her
doubt
on
this
point
,
but
that
he
have
dispel
them
,
and
reassure
her
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
her
family
,
they
be
totally
unworthy
of
her
,
and
their
sentiment
be
utterly
indifferent
to
him
,
and
they
may
---
I
quote
his
own
expression
---
go
to
the
Devil
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
then
deliver
a
warm
eulogy
on
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
Traddles
's
be
a
character
,
to
the
steady
virtue
of
which
he
(
Mr
Micawber
)
could
lay
no
claim
,
but
which
,
he
thank
Heaven
,
he
could
admire
.
 
<EOS>
He
feelingly
allude
to
the
young
lady
,
unknown
,
whom
Traddles
have
honour
with
his
affection
,
and
who
have
reciprocate
that
affection
by
honouring
and
bless
traddle
with
her
affection
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
pledge
her
.
 
<EOS>
so
do
I.
 
Traddles
thank
us
both
,
by
say
,
with
a
simplicity
and
honesty
<EOS>
I
have
sense
enough
to
be
quite
charm
with
,
"
I
be
very
much
oblige
to
you
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
do
assure
you
,
she
be
the
dear
girl
!
---
<EOS>
"
   
Mr
Micawber
take
an
early
opportunity
,
after
that
,
of
hinting
,
with
the
utmost
delicacy
and
ceremony
,
at
the
state
of
my
affection
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
but
the
serious
assurance
of
his
friend
Copperfield
to
the
contrary
,
he
observe
,
could
deprive
him
of
the
impression
that
his
friend
Copperfield
love
and
be
beloved
.
<EOS>
after
feel
very
hot
and
uncomfortable
for
some
time
,
and
after
a
good
deal
of
blush
,
stammer
,
and
deny
,
I
say
,
have
my
glass
in
my
hand
,
"
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
I
would
give
them
d
!
"
<EOS>
which
so
excited
and
gratify
Mr
Micawber
,
that
he
run
with
a
glass
of
punch
into
my
bedroom
,
in
order
that
Mrs
Micawber
may
drink
D
,
who
drink
it
with
enthusiasm
,
cry
from
within
,
in
a
shrill
voice
,
"
Hear
,
hear
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
I
be
delighted
.
 
<EOS>
Hear
!
"
<EOS>
and
tap
at
the
wall
,
by
way
of
applause
.
   
<EOS>
Our
conversation
,
afterwards
,
take
a
more
worldly
turn
;
Mr
Micawber
tell
us
that
he
find
Camden
Town
inconvenient
,
and
that
the
first
thing
he
contemplate
do
,
when
the
advertisement
should
have
be
the
cause
of
something
satisfactory
turn
up
,
be
to
move
.
 
<EOS>
He
mention
a
terrace
at
the
western
end
of
Oxford
Street
,
front
Hyde
Park
,
on
which
he
have
always
have
his
eye
,
but
which
he
do
not
expect
to
attain
immediately
,
as
it
would
require
a
large
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
there
would
probably
be
an
interval
,
he
explain
,
in
which
he
should
content
himself
with
the
upper
part
of
a
house
,
over
some
respectable
place
of
business
---
say
in
Piccadilly
,
---
which
would
be
a
cheerful
situation
for
Mrs
Micawber
;
and
where
,
by
throw
out
a
bow
-
window
,
or
carry
up
the
roof
another
story
,
or
make
some
little
alteration
of
that
sort
,
they
may
live
,
comfortably
and
reputably
,
for
a
few
year
.
<EOS>
whatever
be
reserve
for
him
,
he
expressly
say
,
or
wherever
his
abode
may
be
,
we
may
rely
on
this
---
there
would
always
be
a
room
for
Traddles
,
and
a
knife
and
fork
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
We
acknowledge
his
kindness
;
and
he
beg
us
to
forgive
his
have
launch
into
these
practical
and
business
-
like
detail
,
and
to
excuse
it
as
natural
in
one
who
be
make
entirely
new
arrangement
in
life
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Micawber
,
tap
at
the
wall
again
to
know
if
tea
be
ready
,
break
up
this
particular
phase
of
our
friendly
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
She
make
tea
for
us
in
a
most
agreeable
manner
;
and
,
whenever
I
go
near
her
,
in
handing
about
the
tea
-
cup
and
bread
-
and
-
butter
,
ask
me
,
in
a
whisper
,
whether
D
be
fair
,
or
dark
,
or
whether
she
be
short
,
or
tall
:
or
something
of
that
kind
;
which
I
think
I
like
.
<EOS>
after
tea
,
we
discuss
a
variety
of
topic
before
the
fire
;
and
Mrs
Micawber
be
good
enough
to
sing
us
(
in
a
small
,
thin
,
flat
voice
,
which
I
remember
to
have
consider
,
when
I
first
know
her
,
the
very
table
-
beer
of
acoustic
)
<EOS>
the
favourite
ballad
of
"
the
Dashing
White
Sergeant
"
,
and
"
Little
Tafflin
"
.
 
<EOS>
for
both
of
these
song
Mrs
Micawber
have
be
famous
when
she
live
at
home
with
her
papa
and
mama
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
tell
us
,
that
when
he
hear
her
sing
the
first
one
,
on
the
first
occasion
of
his
see
her
beneath
the
parental
roof
,
she
have
attract
his
attention
in
an
extraordinary
degree
;
but
that
when
it
come
to
Little
Tafflin
,
he
have
resolve
to
win
that
woman
or
perish
in
the
attempt
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
between
ten
and
eleven
o'clock
when
Mrs
Micawber
rise
to
replace
her
cap
in
the
whitey
-
brown
paper
parcel
,
and
to
put
on
her
bonnet
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
take
the
opportunity
of
traddle
put
on
his
great
-
coat
,
to
slip
a
letter
into
my
hand
,
with
a
whisper
request
that
I
would
read
it
at
my
leisure
.
 
<EOS>
I
also
take
the
opportunity
of
my
hold
a
candle
over
the
banister
to
light
them
down
,
when
Mr
Micawber
be
go
first
,
lead
Mrs

,
and
Traddles
be
follow
with
the
cap
,
to
detain
Traddles
for
a
moment
on
the
top
of
the
stair
.
   
<EOS>
"
Traddles
,
"
say
I
,
"
Mr
Micawber
do
not
mean
any
harm
,
poor
fellow

<EOS>
but
,
if
I

I
would
not

him
anything

<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
"
<EOS>

<EOS>
You

that
something

return
Traddles
,
with
a
thoughtful
look
.
   
<EOS>
"
certainly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh

say
Traddles

<EOS>
"
yes

<EOS>
I
be
very
much
oblige
to
you

but
---
I
be
afraid
I
have
lend
him
that
already
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
for
the
bill
that
be
to
be
a
certain
investment
?
"
I
inquire
.
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
for
that
one
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
first
I
have
hear
of
that
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
think
that
he
will
most
likely
propose
that
one
,
on
the
way
home
.
 
<EOS>
Mine
be
another
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
there
will
be
nothing
wrong
about
it

"
say
I.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
"
say
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
not
,
though
,
because
he
tell
me
,
only
the
other
day
,
that
it
be
provide
for
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
Mr
Micawber
's
expression
,
"
provide
for

"
<EOS>
"
   
Mr
Micawber
look
up
at
this
juncture
to
where
we
be
stand
,
I
have
only
time
to
repeat
my
caution
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
thank
me
,
and
descend
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
much
afraid
,
when
I
observe
the
good
-
natured
manner
in
which
he
go
down
with
the
cap
in
his
hand
,
and
give
Mrs
Micawber
his
arm
,
that
he
would
be
carry
into
the
money
market
neck
and
heel
.
   
<EOS>
I
return
to
my
fireside
,
and
be
muse
,
half
gravely
and
half
laughing
,
on
the
character
of
Mr
Micawber
and
the
old
relation
between
us
,
when
I
hear
a
quick
step
ascend
the
stair
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
,
I
think
it
be
traddle
come
back
for
something
Mrs
Micawber
have
leave
behind
;
but
as
the
step
approach
,
I
know
it
,
and
feel
my
heart
beat
high
,
and
the
blood
rush
to
my
face
,
for
it
be
Steerforth
's
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
never
unmindful
of
Agnes
,
and
she
never
leave
that
sanctuary
in
my
thought
---
if
I
may
call
it
so
---
where
I
have
place
her
from
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
he
enter
,
and
stand
before
me
with
his
hand
out
,
the
darkness
that
have
fall
on
him
change
to
light
,
and
I
feel
confounded
and
ashamed
of
have
doubt
one
I
love
so
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
her
none
the
less
;
I
think
of
her
as
the
same
benignant
,
gentle
angel
in
my
life
;
I
reproach
myself
,
not
her
,
with
have
do
him
an
injury
;
and
I
would
have
make
him
any
atonement
if
I
have
know
what
to
make
,
and
how
to
make
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
Daisy
,
old
boy
,
dumb
-
foundered
!
"
<EOS>
laugh
Steerforth
,
shake
my
hand
heartily
,
and
throw
it
gaily
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
I
detect
you

<EOS>
His
bright
glance
go
merrily
round
the
room
,
as
he
take
the
seat
on
the
sofa
opposite
to
me
,
which
Mrs
Micawber
have
recently
vacate
,
and
stir
the
fire
into
a
blaze

<EOS>
"
I

so
surprised

I

give

welcome

could
,
in
a
few
word
,
of
Mr
Micawber
.
<EOS>
He
laugh
heartily
at
my
feeble
portrait
of
that
gentleman
,
and
say
he
be
a
man
to
know
,
and
he
must
know
him
.
"
<EOS>
but
who
do
you
suppose
our
other
friend
be
?
"
say
I
,
in
my
turn
.
   
<EOS>
"
Heaven
know
,
"
say
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
a
bore
<EOS>
,
I
hope
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
he
look
a
little
like
one
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
traddle
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
reply
,
triumphantly
.
   
<EOS>
"
who
be
he
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Steerforth
,
in
his
careless
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
remember
Traddles
?
 
<EOS>
Traddles
in
our
room
at
Salem
House
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
that
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
say
Steerforth
,
beat
a
lump
of
coal
on
the
top
of
the
fire
,
with
the
poker
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
he
as
soft
as
ever
?
 
<EOS>
and
where
the
deuce
do
you
pick
him
up
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
extoll
Traddles
in
reply
,
as
highly
as
I
could
;
for
I
feel
that
Steerforth
rather
slight
him
.
 
<EOS>
Steerforth
,
dismiss
the
subject
with
a
light
nod
,
and
a
smile
,
and
the
remark
that
he
would
be
glad
to
see
the
old
fellow
too
,
for
he
have
always
be
an
odd
fish
,
inquire
if
I
could
give
him
anything
to
eat
?
 
<EOS>
during
most
of
this
short
dialogue
,
when
he
have
not
be
speak
in
a
wild
vivacious
manner
,
he
have
sit
idly
beat
on
the
lump
of
coal
with
the
poker
.
<EOS>
I
observe
that
he
do
the
same
thing
while
I
be
get
out
the
remain
of
the
pigeon
-
pie
,
and
so
forth
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
Daisy
,
here
be
a
supper
for
a
king
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
,
start
out
of
his
silence
with
a
burst
,
and
take
his
seat
at
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
do
it
justice
,
for
I
have
come
from
Yarmouth

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"

I

Steerforth

jovially
pour
out
a
glass
of
wine
,
and
drink
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
as
to
understand
him

you

that

;
he
lay
down
his

,
which
he
have

with
great
diligence

begin

in

over
their
content

it

here
it

say
I.

"
that
be
right

<EOS>
It
be
from
Peggotty

something
less
legible

usual

brief

It
inform
me
of
her
husband
's
hopeless
state

hint
at
his
be
"
a
little
nearer
"
than
heretofore

consequently
more
difficult
to
manage
for
his
own
comfort

<EOS>
It
say
nothing
of
her
weariness

watch
,
and
praise
him
highly

<EOS>
It
be
write
with
a
plain

unaffected

homely
piety
that
I

be
genuine

end
with

have
do

<EOS>
the
sun
set
every

die
every

we
must
not

scare
by
the
common

<EOS>
I
notice
,
I
remember
,
as
he
pause
,
look
at
me
with
his
handsome
head
a
little
throw
back
,
and
his
glass
raise
in
his
hand
,
that
,
though
the
freshness
of
the
sea
-
wind
be
on
his
face
,
and
it
be
ruddy
,
there
be
trace
in
it

make
since
I
last
see
it

as
if
he
have
apply
himself
to
some
habitual
strain
of
the
fervent
energy
which
,
when
rouse
,
be
so
passionately
rouse
within
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
it
in
my
thought
to
remonstrate
with
him
upon
his
desperate
way
of
pursue
any
fancy
that
he
take
---
such
as
this
buffeting
of
rough
sea
,
and
brave
of
hard
weather
,
for
example
---
when
my
mind
glance
off
to
the
immediate
subject
of
our
conversation
again
,
and
pursue
that
instead
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
,
Steerforth
,
"
say
I
,
"
if
your
high
spirit
will
listen
to
me

<EOS>
"
They
be
potent
spirit

will
do
whatever
you
like

he
answer
,
move
from
the
table
to
the
fireside
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
then
I
tell
you
what
,
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
will
go
down
and
see
my
old
nurse
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
I
can
do
her
any
good
,
or
render
her
any
real
service
;
but
she
be
so
attached
to
me
that
my
visit
will
have
as
much
effect
on
her
,
as
if
I
could
do
both
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
take
it
so
kindly
that
it
will
be
a
comfort
and
support
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
great
effort
to
make
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
,
for
such
a
friend
as
she
have
be
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Would
not
you
go
a
day
's
journey
,
if
you
be
in
my
place
?
"
   
<EOS>
His
face
be
thoughtful
,

he
sit
consider
a
little
before
he
answer
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
well

You
can
do
no

You

I

ask
you

go
with

<EOS>

quite
,

return

hold

out

with

on

look
at

for
a
moment
without
speak
,
and
then
rejoin
,
still
hold
me
as
before

give
me
a
shake

he
put
on
his
great

coat

light
his
cigar

set
off
to
walk
home

<EOS>
find
him
in

put
on

coat
(

do
not
light
my

have
have
enough
of
that

walk
with
him
as
far
as
the
open
road

a
dull
road
,
then
,
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
in
great
spirit
all

when
we
part
,

I
look
after
him
go
so
gallantly

airily
homeward

I
think
of
his

be
such
a
dear
girl

who
would
wait
for
Traddles

ominous
praise

Chapter
29
.
<EOS>
I
visit
Steerforth
at
his
home
,
again
 
I
mention
to
Mr
Spenlow
in
the
morning
,
that
I
want
leave
of
absence
for
a
short
time
;
and
as
I
be
not
in
the
receipt
of
any
salary
,
and
consequently
be
not
obnoxious
to
the
implacable
Jorkins
,
there
be
no
difficulty
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
that
opportunity
,
with
my
voice
stick
in
my
throat
,
and
my
sight
fail
as
I
utter
the
word
,
to
express
my
hope
that
Miss
Spenlow
be
quite
well
;
to
which
Mr
Spenlow
reply
,
with
no
more
emotion
than
if
he
have
be
speak
of
an
ordinary
human
being
,
that
he
be
much
oblige
to
me
,
and
she
be
very
well
.
   
<EOS>
We
article
clerk
,
as
germ
of
the
patrician
order
of
proctor
,
be
treat
with
so
much
consideration
,
that
I
be
almost
my
own
master
at
all
time
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
do
not
care
,
however
,
to
get
to
Highgate
before
one
or
two
o'clock
in
the
day
,
and
as
we
have
another
little
excommunication
case
in
court
that
morning
,
which
be
call
the
office
of
the
judge
promote
by
Tipkins
against
Bullock
for
his
soul
's
correction
,
I
pass
an
hour
or
two
in
attendance
on
it
with
Mr
Spenlow
very
agreeably
.
 
<EOS>
It
arise
out
of
a
scuffle
between
two
churchwarden
,
one
of
whom
be
allege
to
have
push
the
other
against
a
pump
;
the
handle
of
which
pump
project
into
a
school
-
house
,
which
school
-
house
be
under
a
gable
of
the
church
-
roof
,
make
the
push
an
ecclesiastical
offence
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
amusing
case
;
and
send
me
up
to
Highgate
,
on
the
box
of
the
stage
-
coach
,
think
about
the
Commons
,
and
what
Mr
Spenlow
have
say
about
touch
the
Commons
and
bring
down
the
country
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Steerforth
be
pleased
to
see
me
,
and
so
be
Rosa
Dartle
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
agreeably
surprised
to
find
that
Littimer
be
not
there
,
and
that
we
be
attend
by
a
modest
little
parlour
-
maid
,
with
blue
ribbon
in
her
cap
,
whose
eye
it
be
much
more
pleasant
,
and
much
less
disconcerting
,
to
catch
by
accident
,
than
the
eye
of
that
respectable
man
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
I
particularly
observe
,
before
I
have
be
half
-
an
-
hour
in
the
house
,
be
the
close
and
attentive
watch
Miss
Dartle
keep
upon
me
;
and
the
lurk
manner
in
which
she
seem
to
compare
my
face
with
Steerforth
's
,
and
Steerforth
's
with
mine
,
and
to
lie
in
wait
for
something
to
come
out
between
the
two
.
<EOS>
so
surely
as
I
look
towards
her
,
do
I
see
that
eager
visage
,
with
its
gaunt
black
eye
and
search
brow
,
intent
on
mine
;
or
pass
suddenly
from
mine
to
Steerforth
's
;
or
comprehend
both
of
us
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
lynx
-
like
scrutiny
she
be
so
far
from
falter
when
she
see
I
observe
it
,
that
at
such
a
time
she
only
fix
her
piercing
look
upon
me
with
a
more
intent
expression
still
.
 
<EOS>
Blameless
as
I
be
,
and
know
that
I
be
,
in
reference
to
any
wrong
she
could
possibly
suspect
me
of
<EOS>
,
I
shrink
before
her
strange
eye
,
quite
unable
to
endure
their
hungry
lustre
.
   
<EOS>
all
day
,
she
seem
to
pervade
the
whole
house
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
talk
to
Steerforth
in
his
room
,
I
hear
her
dress
rustle
in
the
little
gallery
outside
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
and
I
engage
in
some
of
our
old
exercise
on
the
lawn
behind
the
house
,
I
see
her
face
pass
from
window
to
window
,
like
a
wander
light
,
until
it
fix
itself
in
one
,
and
watch
us
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
all
four
go
out
walk
in
the
afternoon
,
she
close
her
thin
hand
on
my
arm
like
a
spring
,
to
keep
me
back
,
while
Steerforth
and
his
mother
go
on
out
of
hearing
:
and
then
speak
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
be
a
long
time
,
"
she
say
,
"
without
come
here
.
 
<EOS>
be
your
profession
really
so
engaging
and
interesting
as
to
absorb
your
whole
attention
?
 
<EOS>
I
ask
because
I
always
want
to
be
inform
,
when
I
be
ignorant
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
really
,
though
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
reply
that
I
like
it
well
enough
,
but
that
I
certainly
could
not
claim
so
much
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
know
that
,
because
I
always
like
to
be
put
right
when
I
be
wrong
,
"
say
Rosa
Dartle
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
mean
it
be
a
little
dry
,
perhaps
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
I
reply
;
"
perhaps
it
be
a
little
dry
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
and
that
be
a
reason
why
you
want
relief
and
change
---
excitement
and
all
that
?
"
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
very
true
!
 
<EOS>
but
be
not
it
a
little
---
eh
?
---
for
him
;
I
do
not
mean
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
a
quick
glance
of
her
eye
towards
the
spot
where
Steerforth
be
walk
,
with
his
mother
lean
on
his
arm
,
show
me
whom
she
mean
;
but
beyond
that
,
I
be
quite
lose
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
look
so
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
not
it
---
I
do
not
say
that
it
do
,
mind
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
---
do
not
it
rather
engross
him
?
 
<EOS>
do
not
it
make
him
,
perhaps
,
a
little
more
remiss
than
usual
in
his
visit
to
his
blindly
-
dote
---
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
with
another
quick
glance
at
them
,
and
such
a
glance
at
me
as
seem
to
look
into
my
innermost
thought
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dartle
,
"
I
return
,
"
pray
do
not
think
---
"
   
"
I
do
not
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
me
,
do
not
suppose
that
I
think
anything
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
suspicious
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
ask
a
question
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
state
any
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
find
an
opinion
on
what
you
tell
me
.
<EOS>
then
,
it
be
not
so
?
 
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
I
be
very
glad
to
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
certainly
be
not
the
fact
,
"
say
I
,
perplex
,
"
that
I
be
accountable
for
Steerforth
's
have
be
away
from
home
longer
than
usual
---
if
he
have
be
:
which
I
really
do
not
know
at
this
moment
,
unless
I
understand
it
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
him
this
long
while
,
until
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
Miss
Dartle
,
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
as
she
look
full
at
me
,
I
see
her
face
grow
sharp
and
paler
,
and
the
mark
of
the
old
wound
lengthen
out
until
it
cut
through
the
disfigured
lip
,
and
deep
into
the
nether
lip
,
and
slant
down
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
positively
awful
to
me
in
this
,
and
in
the
brightness
of
her
eye
,
as
she
say
,
look
fixedly
at
me
:
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
he
do
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
repeat
the
word
,
more
to
myself
than
her
,
be
so
amazed
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
he
do
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
with
an
eagerness
that
seem
enough
to
consume
her
like
a
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
in
what
be
that
man
assist
him
,
who
never
look
at
me
without
an
inscrutable
falsehood
in
his
eye
?
<EOS>
if
you
be
honourable
and
faithful
,
I
do
not
ask
you
to
betray
your
friend
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
you
only
to
tell
me
,
be
it
anger
,
be
it
hatred
,
be
it
pride
,
be
it
restlessness
,
be
it
some
wild
fancy

be
it
love

be
it

that
is
lead
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dartle
,
"
<EOS>
I
return
,
"
how
shall
I
tell
you
,
so
that
you
will
believe
me
,
that
I
know
of
nothing
in
Steerforth
different
from
what
there
be
when
I
first
come
here
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
think
of
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
firmly
believe
there
be
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
hardly
understand
even
what
you
mean

"
   
<EOS>
as
she
still
stand
look
fixedly
at
me
,
a
twitching
or
throbbing
,
from
which
I
could
not
dissociate
the
idea
of
pain
,
come
into
that
cruel
mark
;
and
lift
up
the
corner
of
her
lip
as
if
with
scorn
,
or
with
a
pity
that
despise
its
object
.
 
<EOS>
She
put
her
hand
upon
it
hurriedly
---
a
hand
so
thin
and
delicate
,
that
when
I
have
see
her
hold
it
up
before
the
fire
to
shade
her
face
,
I
have
compare
it
in
my
thought
to
fine
porcelain
---
and
say
,
in
a
quick
,
fierce
,
passionate
way
,
"
I
swear
you
to
secrecy
about
this
!
"
<EOS>
say
not
a
word
more
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Steerforth
be
particularly
happy
in
her
son
's
society
,
and
Steerforth
be
,
on
this
occasion
,
particularly
attentive
and
respectful
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
interesting
to
me
to
see
them
together
,
not
only
on
account
of
their
mutual
affection
,
but
because
of
the
strong
personal
resemblance
between
them
,
and
the
manner
in
which
what
be
haughty
or
impetuous
in
him
be
soften
by
age
and
sex
,
in
her
,
to
a
gracious
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
more
than
once
,
that
it
be
well
no
serious
cause
of
division
<EOS>
have
ever
come
between
them
;
or
two
such
nature
---
I
ought
rather
to
express
it
,
two
such
shade
of
the
same
nature
---
may
have
be
hard
to
reconcile
than
the
two
extremest
opposite
in
creation
.
 
<EOS>
the
idea
do
not
originate
in
my
own
discernment
,
I
be
bind
to
confess
,
but
in
a
speech
of
Rosa
Dartle
's
.
   
<EOS>
She
say
at
dinner
:
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
but
do
tell
me
,
though
,
somebody
,
because
I
have
be
think
about
it
all
day
,
and
I
want
to
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
want
to
know
what
,
Rosa
?
"
return
Mrs
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
pray
,
pray
,
Rosa
,
do
not
be
mysterious
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
mysterious
!
"
<EOS>
she
cry
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
really
?
 
<EOS>
do
you
consider
me
so
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
I
constantly
entreat
you
,
"
say
Mrs
Steerforth
,
"
to
speak
plainly
,
in
your
own
natural
manner
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
then
this
be
not
my
natural
manner

"
she
rejoin
.
 
<EOS>
"
now
you
must
really
bear
with
me
,
because
I
ask
for
information
.
 
<EOS>
We
never
know
ourselves

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
have
become
a
second
nature
,
"
say
Mrs
Steerforth
,
without
any
displeasure
;
"
but
I
remember
,
---
<EOS>
and
so
must
you
,
I
think
,
---
when
your
manner
be
different
,
Rosa
;
when
it
be
not
so
guard
,
and
be
more
trustful
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
you
be
right
,
"
she
return
;
"
and
so
it
be
that
bad
habit
grow
upon
one
!
 
<EOS>
really
?
 
<EOS>
less
guard
and
more
trustful
?
<EOS>
how
can
I
,
imperceptibly
,
have
change
,
I
wonder
!
 
<EOS>
well
,
that
be
very
odd
!
 
<EOS>
I
must
study
to
regain
my
former
self
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
,
"
say
Mrs
Steerforth
,
with
a
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
really
will
,
you
know
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
learn
frankness
from
---
<EOS>
let
me
see
---
from
James
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
learn
frankness
,
Rosa
,
"
say
Mrs
Steerforth
quickly
---
<EOS>
for
there
be
always
some
effect
of
sarcasm
in
what
Rosa
Dartle
say
,
though
it
be
say
,
as
this
be
,
in
the
most
unconscious
manner
in
the
world
---
"
in
a
well
school
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
that
I
be
sure
of
,
"
she
answer
,
with
uncommon
fervour
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
I
be
sure
of
anything
,
of
course
,
you
know
,
I
be
sure
of
that

"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Steerforth
appear
to
me
to
regret
have
be
a
little
nettle
;
for
she
presently
say
,
in
a
kind
tone
:
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
my
dear
Rosa
,
we
have
not

what
it

<EOS>
"
that
I
want

she
reply
,
with
provoke
coldness
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh

It

that
the
phrase

"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
as
good
a
phrase
as
another

say
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
thank
you

whether

Should

retort

"

<EOS>
James
and
<EOS>
I
know
our
duty
to
each
other
better
,
I
pray
Heaven
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
say
Miss
Dartle
,
nod
her
head
thoughtfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
that
would
prevent
it
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
of
course
it
would
.
 
<EOS>
exactly
.
<EOS>
now
,
I
be
glad
I
have
be
so
foolish
as
to
put
the
case
,
for
it
be
so
very
good
to
know
that
your
duty
to
each
other
would
prevent
it

<EOS>
thank
you
very
much

"
   
<EOS>
one
other
little
circumstance
connect
with
Miss
Dartle
<EOS>
I
must
not
omit
;
for
I
have
reason
to
remember
it
thereafter
,
when
all
the
irremediable
past
be
render
plain
.
 
<EOS>
during
the
whole
of
this
day
,
but
especially
from
this
period
of
it
,
Steerforth
exert
himself
with
his
utmost
skill
,
and
that
be
with
his
utmost
ease
,
to
charm
this
singular
creature
into
a
pleasant
and
pleased
companion
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
should
succeed
,
be
no
matter
of
surprise
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
that
she
should
struggle
against
the
fascinating
influence
of
his
delightful
art
---
<EOS>
delightful
nature
<EOS>
I
think
it
then
---
do
not
surprise
me
either
;
for
I
know
that
she
be
sometimes
jaundice
and
perverse
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
her
feature
and
her
manner
slowly
change
;
I
see
her
look
at
him
with
grow
admiration
;
I
see
her
try
,
more
and
more
faintly
,
but
always
angrily
,
as
if
she
condemn
a
weakness
in
herself
,
to
resist
the
captivating
power
that
he
possess
;
and
finally
,
I
see
her
sharp
glance
soften
,
and
her
smile
become
quite
gentle
,
and
I
cease
to
be
afraid
of
her
as
I
have
really
be
all
day
,
and
we
all
sit
about
the
fire
,
talk
and
laugh
together
,
with
as
little
reserve
as
if
we
have
be
child
.
   
<EOS>
whether
it
be
because
we
have
sit
there
so
long
,
or
because
Steerforth
be
resolve
not
to
lose
the
advantage
he
have
gain
,
I
do
not
know
;
but
we
do
not
remain
in
the
dining
-
room
more
than
five
minute
after
her
departure
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
play
her
harp
,
"
say
Steerforth
,
softly
,
at
the
drawing
-
room
door
,
"
and
nobody
but
my
mother
have
hear
her
do
that
,
I
believe
,
these
three
year
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
say
it
with
a
curious
smile
,
which
be
go
directly
;
and
we
go
into
the
room
and
find
her
alone
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
not
get
up
,
"
say
Steerforth
(
which
she
have
already
do
)
"
<EOS>
my
dear
Rosa
,
do
not

be
kind
for
once

<EOS>
and
let
me
sit
and
listen
as
I
use
to
do

"
   
<EOS>
He
do
not
touch
her
,
or
the
chair
from
which
she
have
rise
,
but
sit
himself
near
the
harp
.
 
<EOS>
She
stand
beside
it
for
some
little
while
,
in
a
curious
way
,
go
through
the
motion
of
play
it
with
her
right
hand
,
but
not
sound
it
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
she
sit
down
,
and
draw
it
to
her
with
one
sudden
action
,
and
play
and
sing
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
it
be
,
in
her
touch
or
voice
,
that
make
that
song
the
most
unearthly
<EOS>
I
have
ever
hear
in
my
life
,
or
can
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
fearful
in
the
reality
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
it
have
never
be
write
,
or
set
to
music
,
but
spring
out
of
passion
within
her
;
which
find
imperfect
utterance
in
the
low
sound
of
her
voice
,
and
crouch
again
when
all
be
still
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
dumb
when
she
lean
beside
the
harp
again
,
play
it
,
but
not
sound
it
,
with
her
right
hand
.
   
<EOS>
a
minute
more
,
and
this
have
rouse
me
from
my
trance
:
---
Steerforth
have
leave
his
seat
,
and
go
to
her
,
and
have
put
his
arm
laughingly
about
her
,
and
have
say
,
"
come
,
Rosa
,
for
the
future
we
will
love
each
other
very
much
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
have
strike
him
,
and
have
throw
him
off
with
the
fury
of
a
wild
cat
,
and
have
burst
out
of
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
with
Rosa
?
"
say
Mrs
Steerforth
,
come
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
have
be
an
angel

mother

"
return
Steerforth
,
"
for
a
little
while
;
and
have
run
into
the
opposite
extreme
,
since
,
by
way
of
compensation
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
should
be
careful
not
to
irritate
her
,
James

<EOS>
Her

sour

"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
do
not
come
back
;
and
no
other
mention
be
make
of
her
,
until
I
go
with
Steerforth
into
his
room
to
say
good
night
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
laugh
about
her
,
and
ask
me
if
I
have
ever
see
such
a
fierce
little
piece
of
incomprehensibility
.
   
<EOS>
I
express
as
much
of
my
astonishment
as
be
then
capable
of
expression
,
and
ask
if
he
could
guess
what
it
be
that
she
have
take
so
much
amiss
,
so
suddenly
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Heaven
know
,
"
say
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
anything
you
like
---
or
nothing

I
tell
you
she
take
everything

herself
include

to
a
grindstone

sharpen
it

She

<EOS>
He
be
unwilling
to
let
me
go
;
and
stand
,
hold
me
out
,
with
a
hand
on
each
of
my
shoulder
,
as
he
have
do
in
my
own
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Daisy

he
say
,
with
a
smile

"
<EOS>
for
though
that

like
good
to
call
you
by

I

I

I

you
could
give
it

<EOS>
"
why
so
I
can

if
I
choose

"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Daisy
,
if
anything
should
ever
separate
us

you
must
think
of
me
at
my
good
,
old
boy

<EOS>
Come
!
 
<EOS>
let
us
make
that
bargain

<EOS>

of
me
at
my
good
,
if
circumstance
should
ever
part
us

<EOS>
"
You
have
no
good
to
me

I

no
bad

<EOS>
You
be
always
equally
love

and
cherish
in
my
heart

"
   
<EOS>
so
much
compunction
for
have
ever
wrong
him
,
even
by
a
shapeless
thought
<EOS>
,
do
I
feel
within
me
,
that
the
confession
of
have
do
so
be
rise
to
my
lip
.
 
<EOS>
but
for
the
reluctance
I
have
to
betray
the
confidence
of
Agnes
,
but
for
my
uncertainty
how
to
approach
the
subject
with
no
risk
of
do
so
,
it
would
have
reach
them
before
he
say
,
"
God
bless
you
,
Daisy
,
and
good
night
!
<EOS>
"
in
my
doubt
,
it
do
not
reach
them
;
and
we
shake
hand
,
and
we
part
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
up
with
the
dull
dawn
,
and
,
have
dress
as
quietly
as
I
could
,
look
into
his
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
fast
asleep
;
lying
,
easily
,
with
his
head
upon
his
arm
,
as
I
have
often
see
him
lie
at
school
.
   
<EOS>
the
time
come
in
its
season
,
and
that
be
very
soon
,
when
I
almost
wonder
that
nothing
trouble
his
repose
,
as
I
look
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
sleep
---
<EOS>
let
me
think
of
him
so
again
---
as
I
have
often
see
him
sleep
at
school
;
and
thus
,
in
this
silent
hour
,
I
leave
him
.
   
<EOS>
---
never
more
,
oh
god
forgive
you
,
Steerforth
!
<EOS>
to
touch
that
passive
hand
in
love
and
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
never
,
never
more
!

Chapter
30
.
<EOS>
a
loss
 
I
get
down
to
Yarmouth
in
the
evening
,
and
go
to
the
inn
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
Peggotty
's
spare
room
---
my
room
---
be
likely
to
have
occupation
enough
in
a
little
while
,
<EOS>
if
that
great
Visitor
,
before
whose
presence
all
the
living
must
give
place
,
be
not
already
in
the
house
;
so
I
betook
myself
to
the
inn
,
and
dine
there
,
and
engage
my
bed
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
ten
o'clock
when
I
go
out
.
 
<EOS>
many
of
the
shop
be
shut
,
and
the
town
be
dull
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
Omer
and
Joram
's
,
I
find
the
shutter
up
,
but
the
shop
door
stand
open
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
could
obtain
a
perspective
view
of
Mr
Omer
inside
,
smoke
his
pipe
by
the
parlour
door
,
I
enter
,
and
ask
him
how
he
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
bless
my
life
and
soul
!
"
say
Mr
Omer
,
"
how
do
you
find
yourself
?
 
<EOS>
take
a
seat
.
 
<EOS>
---
smoke
not
disagreeable
,
I
hope
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
by
no
means
,
"

I.
 
<EOS>
"
I
like
it

in
somebody
else
's
pipe

<EOS>
"
what
,
not
in
your
own
,
eh
?
"
Mr
Omer
return
,
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
"
all
the
well
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
bad
habit
for
a
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
take
a
seat
.
 
<EOS>
I
smoke
,
myself
,
for
the
asthma
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Omer
have
make
room
for
me
,
and
place
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
He
now
sit
down
again
very
much
out
of
breath
,
gasp
at
his
pipe
as
if
it
contain
a
supply
of
that
necessary
,
without
which
he
must
perish
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
to
have
hear
bad
news
of
Mr
Barkis
,
"
say
I.
   
Mr
Omer
look
at
me
,
with
a
steady
countenance
,
and
shake
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
how
he
be
tonight
?
"
I
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
the
very
question
I
should
have
put
to
you
,
sir
,
"
return
Mr
Omer
,
"
but
on
account
of
delicacy
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
the
drawback
of
our
line
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
when
a
party
's
ill
,
we
can
not
ask
how
the
party
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
difficulty
have
not
occur
to
me
;
though
I
have
have
my
apprehension
too
,
when
I
go
in
,
of
hear
the
old
tune
.
 
<EOS>
on
its
be
mention
,
I
recognize
it
,
however
,
and
say
as
much
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
you
understand
,
"
say
Mr
Omer
,
nod
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
dursn't
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
bless
you
,
it
would
be
a
shock
that
the
generality
of
party
might
not
recover
,
to
say
"
Omer
and
Joram
's
compliment
,
and
how
do
you
find
yourself
this
morning
?

<EOS>
---
or
this
afternoon
---
as
it
may
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Omer
and
I
nod
at
each
other
,
and
Mr
Omer
recruit
his
wind
by
the
aid
of
his
pipe
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
one
of
the
thing
that
cut
the
trade
off
from
attention
they
could
often
wish
to
show
,

say
Mr
Omer
.
 
<EOS>
"
take
myself
.

I
have
know
Barkis
a
year

I
have

forty
year

I
can

how

<EOS>
"

I
feel
it
be
rather
hard
on
Mr

I
tell
him
so
.

"
I
be
not

I
say

go

with
a
very
complacent

amiable
face

take
several
puff
in
silence

,
resume
his
first
point

accordingly
we
be
obleeged

She
know

I

Mr

I
could
conscientiously
nod
my

as
divine
his
meaning

<EOS>
My
quickness
of
apprehension
seem
to
please
him

he
go
on

now
I
consider

We

Em'ly

extraordinary
affectionate

well

I
do
not

I
rather

you
may

if
you
begin
early

<EOS>
She
have
make
a

it

up

I
never
do

<EOS>
none

do

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Omer
,
hear
his
daughter
's
footstep
before
I
hear
it
,
touch
me
with
his
pipe
,
and
shut
up
one
eye
,
as
a
caution
.
 
<EOS>
She
and
her
husband
come
in
immediately
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
Their
report
be
,
that
Mr
Barkis
be
"
as
bad
as
bad
could
be
"
;
that
he
be
quite
unconscious
;
and
that
Mr
Chillip
have
mournfully
say
in
the
kitchen
,
on
go
away
just
now
,
that
the
College
of
Physicians
,
the
College
of
Surgeons

Apothecaries
'
Hall
,
if
they
be
all
call
in

could
not

him

He
be
past
both
college
,
Mr
Chillip
say
,
and
the
Hall
could
only
poison
him
.
   
<EOS>
hear
this
,
and
learn
that
Mr
Peggotty
be
there
,
I
determine
to
go
to
the
house
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
I
bade
good
night
to
Mr
Omer
,
and
to
Mr
and
Mrs
Joram
;
and
direct
my
step
thither
,
with
a
solemn
feeling
,
which
make
Mr
Barkis
quite
a
new
and
different
creature
.
   
<EOS>
My
low
tap
at
the
door
be
answer
by
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
so
much
surprised
to
see
me
as
I
have
expect
.
 
<EOS>
I
remark
this
in
Peggotty
,
too
,
when
she
come
down
;
and
I
have
see
it
since
;
and
I
think
,
in
the
expectation
of
that
dread
surprise
,
all
other
change
and
surprise
dwindle
into
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
I
shake
hand
with
Mr
Peggotty
,

pass
into
the
kitchen

while
he
softly
close
the
door

the
room
above

<EOS>
I
have
not
think
of
it
on
the
occasion
of
my
last
visit
,
but
how
strange
it
be
to
me
,
now
,
to
miss
Mr

out
of
the
kitchen

there
be
a
trembling
upon

I
can
see
now

<EOS>
the
coldness
of
her
hand
when
I
touch
it
<EOS>
,
I
can
feel
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Its
only
sign
of
animation
be
to
shrink
from
mine
;
and
then
she
glide
from
the
chair
,
and
creep
to
the
other
side
of
her
uncle
,
bow
herself
,
silently
and
tremble
still
,
upon
his
breast

Mr

<EOS>
She
cling
the
close
to
him

neither
lift
up

speak
a
word

<EOS>
"
It

he
bend
his

say
Mr
Peggotty

look
round
at
both

infinite
pride

of
the
quiet
that
prevail
;
and
when
I
turn
back
,
I
find
Mr
Peggotty
still
talk
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
I
be
a
go
upstairs
to
tell
your
aunt
as
Mas'r
Davy
be
here
,
and
that
will
cheer
her
up
a
bit

he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
sit
ye
down
by
the
fire
,
the
while

my
dear
,

warm
those
mortal
cold
hand

<EOS>
You
<EOS>
doen't
need
to
be
so
fearsome
,
and
take
on
so
much

<EOS>
what
?
 
<EOS>
You
will
go
along
with
me
?

<EOS>
well

come
along

come

turn
out

lay
down

Mas'r

say
Mr
Peggotty
,
with
no
less
pride
than
before
,
<EOS>
"
it
be
my
belief
<EOS>
she
would
go
along
with
him
,
now
!
 
<EOS>

there
will
be
someone
else
,
soon

someone
else
,
soon

Em'ly

"
   
<EOS>
afterwards
,
when
I
go
upstairs
,
as
I
pass
the
door
of
my
little
chamber
,
which
be
dark
,
I
have
an
indistinct
impression
of
her
be
within
it
,
cast
down
upon
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
whether
it
be
really
she
,
or
whether
it
be
a
confusion
of
the
shadow
in
the
room
,
I
do
not
know
now
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
leisure
to
think
,
before
the
kitchen
fire
,
of
pretty
little
Emily
's
dread
of
death
---
which
,
add
to
what
Mr
Omer
have
tell
me
,
I
take
to
be
the
cause
of
<EOS>
her
be
so
unlike
herself
---
<EOS>
and
I
have
leisure
,
before
Peggotty
come
down
,
even
to
think
more
leniently
of
the
weakness
of
it
:
as
I
sit
count
the
ticking
of
the
clock
,
and
deepen
my
sense
of
the
solemn
hush
around
me
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
take
me
in
her
arm
,
and
bless
and
thank
me
over
and
over
again
for
be
such
a
comfort
to
her
<EOS>
(
that
be
what
she
say
)
in
her
distress
.
 
<EOS>
She
then
entreat
me
to
come
upstairs
,
sob
that
Mr
Barkis
have
always
like
me
and
admire
me
;
that
he
have
often
talk
of
me
,
before
he
fall
into
a
stupor
;
and
that
she
believe
,
in
case
of
his
come
to
himself
again
,
he
would
brighten
up
at
sight
of
me
,
if
he
could
brighten
up
at
any
earthly
thing
.
   
<EOS>
the
probability
of
his
ever
do
so
,
appear
to
me
,
when
I
see
him
,
to
be
very
small
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
lie
with
his
head
and
shoulder
out
of
bed
,
in
an
uncomfortable
attitude
,
half
rest
on
the
box
which
have
cost
him
so
much
pain
and
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
I
learn
,
that
,
when
he
be
past
creep
out
of
bed
to
open
it
,
and
past
assure
himself
of
its
safety
by
mean
of
the
divining
rod
I
have
see
him
use
,
he
have
require
to
have
it
place
on
the
chair
at
the
bed
-
side
,
where
he
have
ever
since
embrace
it
,
night
and
day
.
 
<EOS>
His
arm
lie
on
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
Time
and
the
world
be
slip
from
beneath
him
,
but
the
box
be
there
;
and
the
last
word
he
have
utter
be
(
in
an
explanatory
tone
)
<EOS>
"
old
clothe
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Barkis
,
my
dear
!

say
Peggotty
,
almost
cheerfully
:
bend
over
him
,
while
her
brother
<EOS>
and
I
stand
at
the
bed
's
foot
.
 
<EOS>
"
here

will
not
you
speak
to
Master
Davy

"
   
<EOS>
He
be
as
mute
and
senseless
as
the
box
,
from
which
his
form
derive
the
only
expression
it
have
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
go
out

Mr
Peggotty
to
me
,
behind
his

<EOS>
My

be
dim

so
be
Mr

I
repeat
in

"
   
<EOS>
We
remain
there
,
watch
him
,
a
long
time
---
hour
.
 
<EOS>
what
mysterious
influence
my
presence
have
upon
him
in
that
state
of
his
sense
,
I
shall
not
pretend
to
say
;
but
when
he
at
last
begin
to
wander
feebly
,
it
be
certain
he
be
mutter
about
drive
me
to
school

"
He

for
he
now
open
his
eye

<EOS>
I
be
on
the
point
of
ask
him
if
he
know
me

when
he
try
to
stretch
out

distinctly

Chapter
31
.
<EOS>
a
great
loss
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
difficult
for
me
,
on
Peggotty
's
solicitation
,
to
resolve
to
stay
where
I
be
,
until
after
the
remain
of
the
poor
carrier
should
have
make
their
last
journey
to
Blunderstone
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
long
ago
buy
,
out
of
her
own
saving
,
a
little
piece
of
ground
in
our
old
churchyard
near
the
grave
of
"
her
sweet
girl
"
,
as
she
always
call
my
mother
;
and
there
they
be
to
rest
.
   
<EOS>
in
keep
peggotty
company
,
and
do
all
I
could
for
her
(
little
enough
at
the
utmost
)
,
I
be
as
grateful
<EOS>
,
I
rejoice
to
think
,
as
even
now
I
could
wish
myself
to
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
afraid
I
have
a
supreme
satisfaction
,
of
a
personal
and
professional
nature
,
in
take
charge
of
Mr
Barkis
's
will
,
and
expound
its
content
.
   
<EOS>
I
may
claim
the
merit
of
have
originate
the
suggestion
that
the
will
should
be
look
for
in
the
box
.
 
<EOS>
after
some
search
,
it
be
find
in
the
box
,
at
the
bottom
of
a
horse
's
nose
-
bag
;
wherein
(
besides
hay
)
there
be
discover
an
old
gold
watch
,
with
chain
and
seal
,
which
Mr
Barkis
have
wear
on
his
wedding
-
day
,
and
which
have
never
be
see
before
or
since
;
a
silver
tobacco
-
stopper
,
in
the
form
of
a
leg
;
an
imitation
lemon
,
full
of
minute
cup
and
saucer
,
which
I
have
some
idea
<EOS>
Mr
Barkis
must
have
purchase
to
present
to
me
when
I
be
a
child
,
and
afterwards
find
himself
unable
to
part
with
;
<EOS>
eighty
-
seven
guinea
and
a
half
,
in
guinea
and
half
-
guinea
;
two
hundred
and
ten
pound
,
in
perfectly
clean
Bank
note
;
certain
receipt
for
Bank
of
England
stock
;
an
old
horseshoe
,
a
bad
shilling
,
a
piece
of
camphor
,
and
an
oyster
-
shell
.
<EOS>
from
the
circumstance
of
the
latter
article
have
be
much
polished
,
and
display
prismatic
colour
on
the
inside
,
I
conclude
that
Mr
Barkis
have
some
general
idea
about
pearl
,
which
never
resolve
themselves
into
anything
definite
.
   
<EOS>
for
year
and
year
,
Mr
Barkis
have
carry
this
box
,
on
all
his
journey
,
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
that
it
may
the
well
escape
notice
,
he
have
invent
a
fiction
that
it
belong
to
"
Mr
Blackboy
"
,
and
be
"
to
be
leave
with
Barkis
till
call
for
"
;
a
fable
he
have
elaborately
write
on
the
lid
,
in
character
now
scarcely
legible
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
hoard
,
all
these
year
,
I
find
,
to
good
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
His
property
in
money
amount
to
nearly
three
thousand
pound
.
 
<EOS>
of
this
he
bequeath
the
interest
of
one
thousand
to
Mr
Peggotty
for
his
life
;
on
his
decease
,
the
principal
to
be
equally
divide
between
Peggotty
,
little
Emily
,
and
me
,
or
the
survivor
or
survivor
of
us
,
share
and
share
alike
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
rest
he
die
possess
of
<EOS>
,
he
bequeath
to
Peggotty
;
whom
he
leave
residuary
legatee
,
and
sole
executrix
of
that
his
last
will
and
testament
.
   
<EOS>
I
feel
myself
quite
a
proctor
when
I
read
this
document
aloud
with
all
possible
ceremony
,
and
set
forth
its
provision
,
any
number
of
time
,
to
those
whom
they
concern
.
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
there
be
more
in
the
Commons
than
I
have
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
I
examine
the
will
with
the
deep
attention
,
pronounce
it
perfectly
formal
in
all
respect
,
make
a
pencil
-
mark
or
so
in
the
margin
,
and
think
it
rather
extraordinary
that
I
know
so
much
.
   
<EOS>
in
this
abstruse
pursuit
;
in
make
an
account
for
Peggotty
,
of
all
the
property
into
which
she
have
come
;
in
arrange
all
the
affair
in
an
orderly
manner
;
and
in
be
her
referee
and
adviser
on
every
point
,
to
our
joint
delight
;
I
pass
the
week
before
the
funeral
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
little
emily
in
that
interval
,
but
they
tell
me
she
be
to
be
quietly
marry
in
a
fortnight
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
attend
the
funeral
in
character
,
if
I
may
venture
to
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
I
be
not
dress
up
in
a
black
coat
and
a
streamer
,
to
frighten
the
bird
;
but
I
walk
over
to
Blunderstone
early
in
the
morning
,
and
be
in
the
churchyard
when
it
come
,
attend
only
by
Peggotty
and
her
brother
.
 
<EOS>
the
mad
gentleman
look
on
,
out
of
my
little
window
;
Mr
Chillip
's
baby
wag
its
heavy
head
,
and
roll
its
goggle
eye
,
at
the
clergyman
,
over
its
nurse
's
shoulder
;
Mr
Omer
breathe
short
in
the
background
;
no
one
else
be
there
;
and
it
be
very
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
We
walk
about
the
churchyard
for
an
hour
,
after
all
be
over
;
and
pull
some
young
leave
from
the
tree
above
my
mother
's
grave
.
   
<EOS>
a
dread
fall
on
me
here
.
 
<EOS>
a
cloud
be
lower
on
the
distant
town
,
towards
which
I
retrace
my
solitary
step
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
to
approach
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
to
think
of
what
do
come
,
upon
that
memorable
night
;
of
what
must
come
again
,
if
I
go
on
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
no
bad
,
because
I
write
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
no
well
,
if
I
stop
my
most
unwilling
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
can
undo
it
;
nothing
can
make
it
otherwise
than
as
it
be
.
   
<EOS>
My
old
nurse
be
to
go
to
London
with
me
next
day
,
on
the
business
of
the
will
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Emily
be
pass
that
day
at
Mr
Omer
's
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
all
to
meet
in
the
old
boathouse
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
Ham
would
bring
Emily
at
the
usual
hour
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
walk
back
at
my
leisure
.
 
<EOS>
the
brother
and
sister
would
return
as
they
have
come
,
and
be
expect
us
,
when
the
day
close
in
,
at
the
fireside
.
   
<EOS>
I
part
from
them
at
the
wicket
-
gate
,
where
visionary
Strap
have
rest
with
Roderick
Random
's
knapsack
in
the
day
of
yore
;
and
,
instead
of
go
straight
back
,
walk
a
little
distance
on
the
road
to
Lowestoft
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
turn
,
and
walk
back
towards
Yarmouth
.
 
<EOS>
I
stay
to
dine
at
a
decent
alehouse
,
some
mile
or
two
from
the
Ferry
I
have
mention
before
;
and
thus
the
day
wear
away
,
and
it
be
evening
when
I
reach
it
.
 
<EOS>
rain
be
fall
heavily
by
that
time
,
and
it
be
a
wild
night
;
but
there
be
a
moon
behind
the
cloud
,
and
it
be
not
dark
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
soon
within
sight
of
Mr
Peggotty
's
house
,
and
of
the
light
within
it
shine
through
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
a
little
flounder
across
the
sand
,
which
be
heavy

bring
me
to
the
door
,
and
I
go
in

<EOS>
It
look
very
comfortable
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
have
smoke
his
evening
pipe
and
there
be
preparation
for
some
supper
by
and

<EOS>
the

be
bright
,
the
ashe

throw
up

the
locker
be
ready

in
her
old

<EOS>
in
her
own
old
place
sit
Peggotty
,
once
more
,
look
(
but
for
her
dress
)
as
if
she
have
never

it

<EOS>
She
have
fall
back

already

on
the

the

just

<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
appear
to

Chapter
32
.
<EOS>
the
beginning
of
a
long
journey
 
<EOS>
what
be
natural
in
me
,
be
natural
in
many
other
man
,
I
infer
,
and
so
I
be
not
afraid
to
write
that
I
never
have
love
Steerforth
better
than
when
the
tie
that
bind
me
to
him
be
break
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
keen
distress
of
the
discovery
of
his
unworthiness
,
I
think
more
of
all
that
be
brilliant
in
him
,
I
soften
more
towards
all
that
be
good
in
him
,
I
do
more
justice
to
the
quality
that
may
have
make
him
a
man
of
a
noble
nature
and
a
great
name
,
than
ever
I
have
do
in
the
height
of
my
devotion
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
deeply
as
I
feel
my
own
unconscious
part
in
his
pollution
of
an
honest
home
,
I
believe
that
if
I
have
be
bring
face
to
face
with
him
,
I
could
not
have
utter
one
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
love
him
so
well
still
---
though
he
fascinate
me
no
longer
---
I
should
have
hold
in
so
much
tenderness
the
memory
of
my
affection
for
him
,
that
I
think
I
should
have
be
as
weak
as
a
spirit
-
wound
child
,
in
all
but
the
entertainment
of
a
thought
that
we
could
ever
be
re
-
united
.
<EOS>
that
think
I
never
have
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
,
as
he
have
feel
,
that
all
be
at
an
end
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
what
his
remembrance
of
me
be
,
<EOS>
I
have
never
know
---
they
be
light
enough
,
perhaps
,
and
easily
dismiss
---
but
mine
of
him
be
as
the
remembrance
of
a
cherish
friend
,
who
be
dead
.
   
<EOS>
yes
,
Steerforth
,
long
remove
from
the
scene
of
this
poor
history
!
<EOS>
My
sorrow
may
bear
involuntary
witness
against
you
at
the
judgement
throne
;
but
my
angry
thought
or
my
reproach
never
will
,
I
know
!
   
<EOS>
the
news
of
what
have
happen
soon
spread
through
the
town
;
insomuch
that
as
I
pass
along
the
street
next
morning
,
I
overhear
the
people
speak
of
it
at
their
door
.
 
<EOS>
many
be
hard
upon
her
,
some
few
be
hard
upon
him
,
but
towards
her
second
father
and
her
lover
there
be
but
one
sentiment
.
 
<EOS>
among
all
kind
of
people
a
respect
for
them
in
their
distress
prevail
,
which
be
full
of
gentleness
and
delicacy
.
 
<EOS>
the
seafare
man
keep
apart
,
when
those
two
be
see
early
,
walk
with
slow
step
on
the
beach
;
and
stand
in
knots
,
talk
compassionately
among
themselves
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
on
the
beach
,
close
down
by
the
sea
,
that
I
find
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
easy
to
perceive
that
they
have
not
sleep
all
last
night
,
even
if
Peggotty
have
fail
to
tell
me
of
their
still
sit
just
as
I
leave
them
,
when
it
be
broad
day
.
 
<EOS>
They
look
worn
;
and
I
think
Mr
Peggotty
's
head
be
bow
in
one
night
more
than
in
all
the
year
I
have
know
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
be
both
as
grave
and
steady
as
the
sea
itself
,
then
lie
beneath
a
dark
sky
,
waveless
---
yet
with
a
heavy
roll
upon
it
,
as
if
it
breathe
in
its
rest
---
and
touch
,
on
the
horizon
,
with
a
strip
of
silvery
light
from
the
unseen
sun

<EOS>
"
We
have
have
a

of

say
Mr

to
me
,
when
we
have
all
three
walk
a
little

in

doen't

we
see
our
course
now

"
   
<EOS>
I
happen
to
glance
at
Ham
,
then
look
out
to
sea
upon
the
distant
light
,
and
a
frightful
thought
come
into
my
mind
---
not
that
his
face
be
angry
,
for
it
be
not
;
I
recall
nothing
but
an
expression
of
stern
determination
in
it
---
that
if
ever
he
encounter
Steerforth
,
he
would
kill
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
dooty
here
,

"
say
Mr

,
"
be
do

<EOS>
I
be
a
go

seek
my

"
he
stop
,
and
go
on
in
a
firm
voice
:
"
<EOS>
I
be
a
go
to
seek
her
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
my
dooty
evermore
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
shake
his
head
when
I
ask
him
where
he
would
seek
her
,
and
inquire
if
I
be
go
to
London
tomorrow
?
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
have
not
go
today
,
fear
to
lose
the
chance
of
be
of
any
service
to
him
;
but
that
I
be
ready
to
go
when
he
would

<EOS>
"
I

you

he
rejoin
,
"
if
you
be
agreeable

We
walk
again
,
for
a
while
,
in
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ham
,
"
he
presently
resume
,

he
will
hold
to

We
walk
again
for

nigher

peep
in

like

out

us
for
some
minute
.
 
<EOS>
during
this
interval
,
I
glance
at
Ham
again
,
and
observe
the
same
expression
on
his
face
,
and
his
eye
still
direct
to
the
distant
light
,
I
touch
his
arm
.
   
<EOS>
twice
I
call
him
by
his
name
,
in
the
tone
in
which
I
may
have
try
to
rouse
a
sleeper
,
before
he
heed
me
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
at
last
inquire
on
what
his
thought
be
so
bent
,
he
reply
:
   
"
<EOS>
on
what
be
afore
me
,
Mas'r
Davy
;
and
over
yon
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
on
the
life
before
you
,
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
He
have
point
confusedly
out
to
sea
.
   
<EOS>
"
ay
,
Mas'r
Davy
.
 
<EOS>
I
doen't
rightly
know
how
'
tis
,
but
from
over
yon
there
seem
to
me
to
come
---
<EOS>
the
end
of
it
like
,
"
look
at
me
as
if
he
be
wake
,
but
with
the
same
determined
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
end
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
possess
by
my
former
fear
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
doen't
know
,
"
he
say
,
thoughtfully
;
"
I
be
call
to
mind
that
the
beginning
of
it
all
do
take
place
here
---
<EOS>
and
then
the
end
come
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
go
!
 
<EOS>
Mas'r
Davy
<EOS>
,
"
he
add
;
answering
,
as
I
think
,
my
look
;
"
you
han't
no
call
to
be
afeerd
of
me
:
<EOS>
but
I
be
kiender
muddle
;
I
do
not
fare
to
feel
no
matter
,
"
---
<EOS>
which
be
as
much
as
to
say
that
he
be
not
himself
,
and
quite
confound
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
stop
for
us
to
join
him
:
we
do
so
,
and
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
the
remembrance
of
this
,
in
connexion
with
my
former
thought
,
however
,
haunt
me
at
interval
,
even
until
the
inexorable
end
come
at
its
appoint
time

<EOS>
We
insensibly
approach
the
old

<EOS>
She
take
Mr

's
hat
,
and
place
his
seat
for
him
,
and
speak
so
comfortably
and
softly
,
that
I
hardly

<EOS>
"

when
she
have

she
withdraw
to
the
window
,
where
she
sedulously
employ
herself
in

neatly

<EOS>
meanwhile
,
she
continue
talk
,
in
the

quiet
manner
:

"
   
<EOS>
what
a
change
in
Mrs
Gummidge
in
a
little
time
!
 
<EOS>
She
be
another
woman
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
so
devoted
,
she
have
such
a
quick
perception
of
what
it
would
be
well
to
say
,
and
what
it
would
be
well
to
leave
unsaid
;
she
be
so
forgetful
of
herself
,
and
so
regardful
of
the
sorrow
about
her
,
that
I
hold
her
in
a
sort
of
veneration
.
 
<EOS>
the
work
she
do
that
day
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
many
thing
to
be
bring
up
from
the
beach
and
store
in
the
outhouse
---
as
oar
,
net
,
sail
,
cordage
,
spar
,
lobster
-
pot
,
bag
of
ballast
,
and
the
like
;
and
though
there
be
abundance
of
assistance
render
,
there
be
not
a
pair
of
work
hand
on
all
that
shore
but
would
have
labour
hard
for
Mr
Peggotty
,
and
be
well
pay
in
be
ask
to
do
it
,
yet
she
persist
,
all
day
long
,
in
toil
under
weight
that
she
be
quite
unequal
to
,
and
fag
to
and
fro
on
all
sort
of
unnecessary
errand
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
deplore
her
misfortune
,
she
appear
to
have
entirely
lose
the
recollection
of
ever
have
have
any
.
 
<EOS>
She
preserve
an
equable
cheerfulness
in
the
midst
of
her
sympathy
,
which
be
not
the
least
astonishing
part
of
the
change
that
have
come
over
her
.
 
<EOS>
Querulousness
be
out
of
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
even
observe
her
voice
to
falter
,
or
a
tear
to
escape
from
her
eye
,
the
whole
day
through
,
until
twilight
;
when
she
and
I
and
Mr
Peggotty
be
alone
together
,
and
he
have
fall
asleep
in
perfect
exhaustion
,
she
break
into
a
half
-
suppressed
fit
of
sob
and
cry
,
and
take
me
to
the
door
,
say
,
"
ever
bless
you
,
Mas'r
Davy
<EOS>
,
be
a
friend
to
him
,
poor
dear
!
"
<EOS>
then
,
she
immediately
run
out
of
the
house
to
wash
her
face
,
in
order
that
she
may
sit
quietly
beside
him
,
and
be
find
at
work
there
,
when
he
should
awake
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
I
leave
her
,
when
I
go
away
at
night
,
the
prop
and
staff
of
Mr
Peggotty
's
affliction
;
and
I
could
not
meditate
enough
upon
the
lesson
that
I
read
in
Mrs
Gummidge
,
and
the
new
experience
she
unfold
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
between
nine
and
ten
o'clock
<EOS>
when
,
stroll
in
a
melancholy
manner
through
the
town
,
I
stop
at
Mr
Omer
's
door
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Omer
have
take
it
so
much
to
heart
,
his
daughter
tell
me
,
that
he
have
be
very
low
and
poorly
all
day
,
and
have
go
to
bed
without
his
pipe
.
   
<EOS>
"
a
deceitful
,
bad
-
hearted
girl
,
"
say
Mrs
Joram
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
good
in
her
,
ever
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
not
say
so
,
"
I
return
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
think
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
do
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Mrs
Joram
,
angrily
.
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
<EOS>
I.
   
Mrs
Joram
toss
her
head
,
endeavour
to
be
very
stern
and
cross
;
but
she
could
not
command
her
soft
self
,
and
begin
to
cry
.
<EOS>
I
be
young
,
to
be
sure
;
but
I
think
much
the
well
of
her
for
this
sympathy
,
and
fancy
it
become
her
,
as
a
virtuous
wife
and
mother
,
very
well
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
will
she
ever
do
!
"
<EOS>
sob
Minnie
.
 
<EOS>
"
where
will
she
go
!
 
<EOS>
what
will
become
of
her
!
 
<EOS>
oh
,
how
could
she
be
so
cruel
,
to
herself
and
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
remember
the
time
when
Minnie
be
a
young
and
pretty
girl
;
and
I
be
glad
she
remember
it
too
,
so
feelingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
little
Minnie
,
"
say
Mrs
Joram
,
"
have
only
just
now
be
get
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
even
in
her
sleep
she
be
sob
for
Em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
all
day
long
,
little
Minnie
have
cry
for
her
,
and
ask
me
,
over
and
over
again
,
whether
Em'ly
be
wicked
?
 
<EOS>
what
can
I
say
to
her
,
when
Em'ly
tie
a
ribbon
off
her
own
neck
round
little
Minnie
's
the
last
night
she
be
here
,
and
lay
her
head
down
on
the
pillow
beside
her
till
she
be
fast
asleep
!
 
<EOS>
the
ribbon
's
round
my
little
Minnie
's
neck
now
.
<EOS>
It
ought
not
to
be
,
perhaps
,
but
what
can
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
Em'ly
be
very
bad
,
but
they
be
fond
of
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
child
know
nothing
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Joram
be
so
unhappy
that
her
husband
come
out
to
take
care
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
leave
them
together
,
I
go
home
to
Peggotty
's
;
more
melancholy
myself
,
if
possible
,
than
I
have
be
yet
.
   
<EOS>
that
good
creature
---
<EOS>
I
mean
Peggotty
---
all
<EOS>
untire
by
her
late
anxiety
and
sleepless
night
,
be
at
her
brother
's
,
where
she
mean
to
stay
till
morning
.
 
<EOS>
an
old
woman
,
who
have
be
employ
about
the
house
for
some
week
past
,
while
Peggotty
have
be
unable
to
attend
to
it
,
be
the
house
's
only
other
occupant
besides
myself
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
have
no
occasion
for
her
service
,
I
send
her
to
bed
,
by
no
mean
against
her
will
,
and
sit
down
before
the
kitchen
fire
a
little
while
,
to
think
about
all
this
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
blend
it
with
the
deathbed
of
the
late
Mr
Barkis
,
and
be
drive
out
with
the
tide
towards
the
distance
at
which
Ham
have
look
so
singularly
in
the
morning
,
when
I
be
recall
from
my
wandering
by
a
knock
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
knocker
upon
the
door
,
but
it
be
not
that
which
make
the
sound
.
 
<EOS>
the
tap
be
from
a
hand
,
and
low
down
upon
the
door
,
as
if
it
be
give
by
a
child
.
   
<EOS>
It
make
me
start
as
much
as
if
it
have
be
the
knock
of
a
footman
to
a
person
of
distinction
.
 
<EOS>
I
open
the
door
;
and
at
first
look
down
,
to
my
amazement
,
on
nothing
but
a
great
umbrella
that
appear
to
be
walk
about
of
itself
.
 
<EOS>
but
presently
I
discover
underneath
it
,
Miss
Mowcher
.
   
<EOS>
I
may
not
have
be
prepare
to
give
the
little
creature
a
very
kind
reception
,
if
,
on
her
remove
the
umbrella
,
which
her
utmost
effort
be
unable
to
shut
up
,
she
have
show
me
the
"
volatile
"
expression
of
face
which
have
make
so
great
an
impression
on
me
at
our
first
and
last
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
but
her
face
,
as
she
turn
it
up
to
mine
,
be
so
earnest
;
and
when
I
relieve
her
of
the
umbrella
<EOS>
(
which
would
have
be
an
inconvenient
one
for
the
irish
Giant
)
,
she
wring
her
little
hand
in
such
an
afflicted
manner
;
that
I
rather
incline
towards
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Mowcher
!
<EOS>
"
say
I
,
after
glance
up
and
down
the
empty
street
,
without
distinctly
know
what
I
expect
to
see
besides
;
"
how
do
you
come
here
?
 
<EOS>
what
be
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
She
motion
to
me
with
her
short
right
arm
,
to
shut
the
umbrella
for
her
;
and
pass
me
hurriedly
,
go
into
the
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
close
the
door
,
and
follow
,
with
the
umbrella
in
my
hand
,
I
find
her
sit
on
the
corner
of
the
fender
<EOS>
---
it
be
a
low
iron
one
,
with
two
flat
bar
at
top
to
stand
plate
upon
---
in
the
shadow
of
the
boiler
,
sway
herself
backwards
and
forwards
,
and
chafe
her
hand
upon
her
knee
like
a
person
in
pain
.
   
<EOS>
Quite
alarmed
at
be
the
only
recipient
of
this
untimely
visit
,
and
the
only
spectator
of
this
portentous
behaviour
<EOS>
,
I
exclaim
again
,
"
pray
tell
me
,
Miss
Mowcher
,
what
be
the
matter
!
<EOS>
be
you
ill
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
young
soul
,
"
return
Miss
Mowcher
,
squeeze
her
hand
upon
her
heart
one
over
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
ill
here
,
I
be
very
ill
.
<EOS>
to
think
that
it
should
come
to
this
,
when
I
may
have
know
it
and
perhaps
prevent
it
,
if
I
have
not
be
a
thoughtless
fool
!
"
   
<EOS>
again
her
large
bonnet
(
very
disproportionate
to
the
figure
)
go
backwards
and
forwards
,
in
her
swaying
of
her
little
body
to
and
fro
;
while
a
most
gigantic
bonnet
rock
,
in
unison
with
it
,
upon
the
wall
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
surprised
,
"
I
begin
,
"
to
see
you
so
distressed
and
serious
"
---
when
she
interrupt
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
it
be
always
so
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
be
all
surprised
,
these
inconsiderate
young
people
,
fairly
and
full
grown
,
to
see
any
natural
feeling
in
a
little
thing
like
me
!
 
<EOS>
They
make
a
plaything
of
me
,
use
me
for
their
amusement
,
throw
me
away
when
they
be
tired
,
and
wonder
that
I
feel
more
than
a
toy
horse
or
a
wooden
soldier
!
 
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
that
be
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
way
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
,
with
other
,
"
I
return
,
"
but
I
do
assure
you
it
be
not
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
I
ought
not
to
be
at
all
surprised
to
see
you
as
you
be

can
never
fill
the
place
that
be
empty
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
will
bear
in
mind
about
the
money
,
as
theer
be
at
all
time
some
lay
by
for
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
remind
him
of
the
fact
,
that
Mr
Peggotty
derive
a
steady
,
though
certainly
a
very
moderate
income
from
the
bequest
of
his
late
brother
-
in
-
law
,
I
promise
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
We
then
take
leave
of
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
leave
him
even
now
,
without
remember
with
a
pang
,
at
once
his
modest
fortitude
and
his
great
sorrow
.
   
<EOS>
as
to
Mrs
Gummidge
,
if
I
be
to
endeavour
to
describe
how
she
run
down
the
street
by
the
side
of
the
coach
,
see
nothing
<EOS>
but
Mr
Peggotty
on
the
roof
,
through
the
tear
she
try
to
repress
,
and
dash
herself
against
the
people
who
be
come
in
the
opposite
direction
,
I
should
enter
on
a
task
of
some
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
I
have
better
leave
her
sit
on
a
baker
's
door
-
step
,
out
of
breath
,
with
no
shape
at
all
remain
in
her
bonnet
,
and
one
of
her
shoe
off
,
lie
on
the
pavement
at
a
considerable
distance
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
get
to
our
journey
's
end
,
our
first
pursuit
be
to
look
about
for
a
little
lodging
for
Peggotty
,
where
her
brother
could
have
a
bed
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
so
fortunate
as
to
find
one
,
of
a
very
clean
and
cheap
description
,
over
a
chandler
's
shop
,
only
two
street
remove
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
have
engage
this
domicile
,
I
buy
some
cold
meat
at
an
eat
-
house
,
and
take
my
fellow
-
traveller
home
to
tea
;
a
proceeding
,
I
regret
to
state
,
which
do
not
meet
with
Mrs
Crupp
's
approval
,
but
quite
the
contrary
.
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
observe
,
however
,
in
explanation
of
that
lady
's
state
of
mind
,
that
she
be
much
offend
by
<EOS>
Peggotty
's
tucking
up
her
widow
's
gown
before
she
have
be
ten
minute
in
the
place
,
and
set
to
work
to
dust
my
bedroom
.
 
<EOS>
this
Mrs
Crupp
regard
in
the
light
of
a
liberty
,
and
a
liberty
,
she
say
,
be
a
thing
she
never
allow
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
have
make
a
communication
to
me
on
the
way
to
London
for
which
I
be
not
unprepared
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
,
that
he
purpose
first
see
Mrs
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
feel
bind
to
assist
him
in
this
,
and
also
to
mediate
between
them
;
with
the
view
of
spare
the
mother
's
feeling
as
much
as
possible
,
I
write
to
her
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
as
mildly
as
I
could
what
his
wrong
be
,
and
what
my
own
share
in
his
injury
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
he
be
a
man
in
very
common
life
,
but
of
a
most
gentle
and
upright
character
;
and
that
I
venture
to
express
a
hope
that
she
would
not
refuse
to
see
him
in
his
heavy
trouble
.
<EOS>
I
mention
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
as
the
hour
of
our
come
,
and
I
send
the
letter
myself
by
the
first
coach
in
the
morning
.
   
<EOS>
at
the
appoint
time
,
we
stand
at
the
door
---
the
door
of
that
house
where
I
have
be
,
a
few
day
since
,
so
happy
:
where
my
youthful
confidence
and
warmth
of
heart
have
be
yield
up
so
freely
:
which
be
close
against
me
henceforth
:
which
be
now
a
waste
,
a
ruin
.
   
<EOS>
no
Littimer
appear
.
 
<EOS>
the
pleasanter
face
which
have
replace
his
,
on
the
occasion
of
my
last
visit
,
answer
to
our
summon
,
and
go
before
us
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Steerforth
be
sit
there
.
<EOS>
Rosa
Dartle
glide
,
as
we
go
in
,
from
another
part
of
the
room
and
stand
behind
her
chair
.
   
<EOS>
I
see
,
directly
,
in
his
mother
's
face
,
that
she
know
from
himself
what
he
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
pale
;
and
bear
the
trace
of
deep
emotion
than
my
letter
alone
,
weaken
by
the
doubt
her
fondness
would
have
raise
upon
it
,
would
have
be
likely
to
create
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
her
more
like
him
than
ever
I
have
think
her
;
and
I
feel
,
rather
than
see
,
that
the
resemblance
be
not
lose
on
my
companion
.
   
<EOS>
She
sit
upright
in
her
arm
-
chair
,
with
a
stately
,
immovable
,
passionless
air
,
that
it
seem
as
if
nothing
could
disturb
.
 
<EOS>
She
look
very
steadfastly
at
Mr
Peggotty
when
he
stand
before
her
;
and
he
look
quite
as
steadfastly
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
Rosa
Dartle
's
keen
glance
comprehend
all
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
for
some
moment
not
a
word
be
speak
.
   
<EOS>
She
motion
to
Mr
Peggotty
to
be
seat
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
I
should
not
feel
it
nat'ral
,
madam
,
to
sit
down
in
this
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
sooner
stand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
this
be
succeed
by
another
silence
,
which
she
break
thus
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
with
deep
regret
,
what
have
bring
you
here
.
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
want
of
me
?
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
ask
me
to
do
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
put
his
hat
under
his
arm
,
and
feel
in
his
breast
for
Emily
's
letter
,
take
it
out
,
unfold
it
,
and
give
it
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
please
to
read
that
,
madam
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
my
niece
's
hand
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
read
it
,
in
the
same
stately
and
impassive
way
,
---
untouche
by
its
content
,
as
far
as
I
could
see
,
---
and
return
it
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
unless
he
bring
me
back
a
lady

"
say
Mr
Peggotty
,
trace
out
that
part
with
his
finger
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
come

she
return

<EOS>
"
why
not

"
say
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
impossible

<EOS>
He
would
disgrace
himself

<EOS>
You
can
not
fail
to
know
that

be
far
below
him

"
   
<EOS>
"
raise
her
up

"
say
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
be

<EOS>
"
maybe

Mr

I

no

<EOS>
"
since
you
oblige
me
to
speak
more
plainly
,
which
I
be
very
unwilling

her

render

while
I

<EOS>
the
mere
vehemence
of
her
word
can
convey
,
I
be
sensible
,
but
a
weak
impression
of
the
passion
by
which
she
be
possess
,
and
which
make
itself
articulate
in
her
whole
figure
,
though
her
voice
,
instead
of
be
raise
,
be
low
than
usual

<EOS>
no
description
I
could
give
of
her
would
do
justice
to
my
recollection
of
her

to
her
entire
deliverance
of
herself
to
her
anger

<EOS>
I
have
see
passion
in
many
form
,
but
I
have
never
see
it
in
such
a
form
as
that
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
join
Mr
Peggotty
,
he
be
walk
slowly
and
thoughtfully
down
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
as
soon
as
I
come
up
with
him
,
that
have
now
discharge
his
mind
of
what
he
have
purpose
do
in
London
,
he
mean
"
to
set
out
on
his
travel
"
,
that
night

I
ask
him
where
he
mean

go

He
only
answer
,
"
I
be
a
going
,
sir

to
seek
my

<EOS>
We
go
back
to
the
little
lodging
over
the
chandler
's
shop
,
and
there
I
find
an
opportunity
of
repeat
to
Peggotty
what
he
have
say
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
inform
me
,
in
return
,
that
he
have
say
the
same
to
her
that
morning
.
 
<EOS>
She
know
no
more
than
I
do
,
where
he
be
go
,
but
she
think
he
have
some
project
shape
out
in
his
mind
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
to
leave
him
,
under
such
circumstance
,
and
we
all
three
dine
together
off
a
beefsteak
pie
---
which
be
one
of
the
many
good
thing
for
which
Peggotty
be
famous
---
and
which
be
curiously
flavour
on
this
occasion
<EOS>
,
I
recollect
well
,
by
a
miscellaneous
taste
of
tea
,
coffee
,
butter
,
bacon
,
cheese
,
new
loaf
,
firewood
,
candle
,
and
walnut
ketchup
,
continually
ascend
from
the
shop
.
 
<EOS>
after
dinner
we
sit
for
an
hour
or
so
near
the
window
,
without
talk
much
;
and
then
Mr
Peggotty
get
up
,
and
bring
his
oilskin
bag
and
his
stout
stick
,
and
lay
them
on
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
He
accept
,
from
his
sister
's
stock
of
ready
money
,
a
small
sum
on
account
of
his
legacy
;
barely
enough
,
I
should
have
think
,
to
keep
him
for
a
month
.
 
<EOS>
He
promise
to
communicate
with
me
,
when
anything
befall
him
;
and
he
sling
his
bag
about
him
,
take
his
hat
and
stick
,
and
bid
us
both
"
good
-
bye
!
"

"
all
good

dear
old
woman

Peggotty

home
while
I
be
away

ah
,
that
be
not
like
to
be
!

or
if
I
should
bring
her
back
,
my
meaning
be
,
that
she
and
me
shall
live
and
die
where
no
one
can
not
reproach
her
.
 
<EOS>
if
any
hurt
should
come
to
me

remember
that
the
last
word
I
leave
for
her

My

He
say
this
solemnly
,
bare
-
head
;
then
,
put
on
his
hat
,
he
go
down
the
stair
,
and
away
.
 
<EOS>
We
follow
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
warm
,
dusty
evening
,
just
the
time
when
,
in
the
great
main
thoroughfare
out
of
which
that
by
-
way
turn
,
there
be
a
temporary
lull
in
the
eternal
tread
of
foot
upon
the
pavement
,
and
a
strong
red
sunshine
.
 
<EOS>
He
turn
,
alone
,
at
the
corner
of
our
shady
street
,
into
a
glow
of
light
,
in
which
we
lose
him
.
   
<EOS>
rarely
do
that
hour
of
the
evening
come
,
rarely
do
I
wake
at
night
,
rarely
do
I
look
up
at
the
moon
,
or
star
,
or
watch
the
fall
rain
,
or
hear
the
wind
,
but
I
think
of
his
solitary
figure
toil
on
,
poor
pilgrim
,
and
recall
the
word
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
a
go

seek
her
,
fur
and
wide

<EOS>

any

Chapter
33
.
<EOS>
blissful
 
<EOS>
all
this
time
,
I
have
go
on
love
Dora
,
harder
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
Her
idea
be
my
refuge
in
disappointment
and
distress
,
and
make
some
amend
to
me
,
even
for
the
loss
of
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
the
more
I
pity
myself
,
or
pity
other
,
the
more
I
seek
for
consolation
in
the
image
of
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
the
accumulation
of
deceit
and
trouble
in
the
world
,
<EOS>
the
bright
and
the
purer
shine
the
star
of
Dora
high
above
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
I
have
any
definite
idea
where
Dora
come
from
,
or
in
what
degree
she
be
relate
to
a
high
order
of
being
;
but
I
be
quite
sure
I
should
have
scout
the
notion
of
her
be
simply
human
,
like
any
other
young
lady
,
with
indignation
and
contempt
.
   
<EOS>
if
I
may
so
express
it
,
I
be
steep
in
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
merely
over
head
and
ear
in
love
with
her
,
but
I
be
saturate
through
and
through
.
 
<EOS>
enough
love
may
have
be
wring
out
of
me
,
metaphorically
speak
,
to
drown
anybody
in
;
and
yet
there
would
have
remain
enough
within
me
,
and
all
over
me
,
to
pervade
my
entire
existence
.
   
<EOS>
the
first
thing
I
do
,
on
my
own
account
,
when
I
come
back
,
be
to
take
a
night
-
walk
to
Norwood
,
and
,
like
the
subject
of
a
venerable
riddle
of
my
childhood
,
to
go
"
round
and
round
the
house
,
without
ever
touch
the
house
"
,
think
about
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
the
theme
of
this
incomprehensible
conundrum
be
the
moon
.
 
<EOS>
no
matter
what
it
be
,
I
,
the
moon
-
strike
slave
of
Dora
,
perambulate
round
and
round
the
house
and
garden
for
two
hour
,
look
through
crevice
in
the
paling
,
get
my
chin
by
dint
of
violent
exertion
above
the
rusty
nail
on
the
top
,
blow
kiss
at
the
light
in
the
window
,
and
romantically
call
on
the
night
,
at
interval
,
to
shield
my
Dora
<EOS>
---
I
do
not
exactly
know
what
from
,
I
suppose
from
fire
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
from
mouse
,
to
which
she
have
a
great
objection
.
   
<EOS>
My
love
be
so
much
in
my
mind
<EOS>
and
it
be
so
natural
to
me
to
confide
in
Peggotty
,
when
I
find
her
again
by
my
side
of
an
evening
with
the
old
set
of
industrial
implement
,
busily
make
the
tour
of
my
wardrobe
,
that
I
impart
to
her
,
in
a
sufficiently
roundabout
way
,
<EOS>
my
great
secret
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
be
strongly
interested
,
but
I
could
not
get
her
into
my
view
of
the
case
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
audaciously
prejudice
in
my
favour
,
and
quite
unable
to
understand
why
I
should
have
any
misgiving
,
or
be
low
-
spirited
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
the
young
lady
may
think
herself
well
off
,
"
she
observe
,
"
to
have
such
a
beau
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
to
her
Pa
,
"
she
say
,
"
what
do
the
gentleman
expect
,
for
gracious
sake
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
observe
,
however
,
that
Mr
Spenlow
's
proctorial
gown
and
stiff
cravat
take
Peggotty
down
a
little
,
and
inspire
her
with
a
great
reverence
for
the
man
who
be
gradually
become
more
and
more
etherealize
in
my
eye
every
day
,
and
about
whom
a
reflect
radiance
seem
to
me
to
beam
when
he
sit
erect
in
Court
among
his
paper
,
like
a
little
lighthouse
in
a
sea
of
stationery
.
 
<EOS>
and
by
the
by
,
it
use
to
be
uncommonly
strange
to
me
to
consider
,
I
remember
,
as
I
sit
in
Court
too
,
how
those
dim
old
judge
and
doctor
would
not
have
care
for
Dora
,
if
they
have
know
her
;
how
they
would
not
have
go
out
of
their
sense
with
rapture
,
if
marriage
with
Dora
have
be
propose
to
them
;
how
Dora
may
have
sing
,
and
play
upon
that
glorify
guitar
,
until
she
lead
me
to
the
verge
of
madness
,
yet
not
have
tempt
one
of
those
slow
-
goer
an
inch
out
of
his
road
!
   
<EOS>
I
despise
them
,
to
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
frozen
-
out
old
gardener
in
the
flower
-
bed
of
the
heart
<EOS>
,
I
take
a
personal
offence
against
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
the
Bench
be
nothing
to
me
but
an
insensible
blunderer
.
 
<EOS>
the
Bar
have
no
more
tenderness
or
poetry
in
it
,
than
the
bar
of
a
public
-
house
.
   
<EOS>
take
the
management
of
Peggotty
's
affair
into
my
own
hand
,
with
no
little
pride
,
I
prove
the
will
,
and
come
to
a
settlement
with
the
Legacy
Duty
-
office
,
and
take
her
to
the
Bank
,
and
soon
get
everything
into
an
orderly
train
.
 
<EOS>
We
vary
the
legal
character
of
these
proceeding
by
go
to
see
some
perspiring
wax
-
work
,
in
Fleet
Street
(
melt
,
I
should
hope
,
these
twenty
year
)
;
and
by
visit
Miss
Linwood
's
exhibition
,
which
I
remember
as
a
Mausoleum
of
needlework
,
favourable
to
self
-
examination
and
repentance
;
and
by
inspect
the
Tower
of
London
;
and
go
to
the
top
of
St
Paul
's
.
 
<EOS>
all
these
wonder
afford
Peggotty
as
much
pleasure
as
she
be
able
to
enjoy
,
under
exist
circumstance
:
except
,
I
think
,
St
Paul
's
,
which
,
from
her
long
attachment
to
her
work
-
box
,
become
a
rival
of
the
picture
on
the
lid
,
and
be
,
in
some
particular
,
vanquish
<EOS>
,
she
consider
,
by
that
work
of
art
.
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
's
business
,
which
be
what
we
use
to
call
"
common
-
form
business
"
in
the
Commons
(
and
very
light
and
lucrative
the
common
-
form
business
be
)
,
be
settle
,
I
take
her
down
to
the
office
one
morning
to
pay
her
bill
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
have
step
out
,
old
Tiffey
say
,
to
get
a
gentleman
swear
for
a
marriage
licence
;
but
as
I
know
he
would
be
back
directly
,
<EOS>
our
place
lie
close
to
the
Surrogate
's
,
and
to
the
Vicar
-
General
's
office
too
<EOS>
,
I
tell
Peggotty
to
wait
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
a
little
like
undertaker
,
in
the
Commons
,
as
regard
probate
transaction
;
generally
make
it
a
rule
to
look
more
or
less
cut
up
,
when
we
have
to
deal
with
client
in
mourning
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
similar
feeling
of
delicacy
,
we
be
always
blithe
and
light
-
hearted
with
the
licence
client
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
I
hint
to
Peggotty
that
she
would
find
Mr
Spenlow
much
recover
from
the
shock
of
Mr
Barkis
's
decease
;
and
indeed
he
come
in
like
a
bridegroom
.
   
<EOS>
but
neither
Peggotty
nor
I
have
eye
for
him
,
when
we
see
,
in
company
with
him
,
Mr
Murdstone
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
little
change
.
 
<EOS>
His
hair
look
as
thick
,
and
be
certainly
as
black
,
as
ever
;
and
his
glance
be
as
little
to
be
trust
as
of
old
.
   
<EOS>
"
ah
,
Copperfield
?
"
say
Mr
Spenlow
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
this
gentleman
,
I
believe
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
make
my
gentleman
a
distant
bow
,
and
Peggotty
barely
recognize
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
,
at
first
,
somewhat
disconcert
to
meet
us
two
together
;
but
quickly
decide
what
to
do
,
and
come
up
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
you
be
do
well
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
can
hardly
be
interesting
to
you
,
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
if
you
wish
to
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
We
look
at
each
other
,
and
he
address
himself
to
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
you
,
"
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
to
observe
that
you
have
lose
your
husband
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
the
first
loss
I
have
have
in
my
life
,
Mr
Murdstone
,
"
reply
Peggotty
,
tremble
from
head
to
foot
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
to
hope
that
there
be
nobody
to
blame
for
this
one
,
---
nobody
to
answer
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
ha
!
<EOS>
"
say
he
;
"
that
be
a
comfortable
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
do
your
duty
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
wear
anybody
's
life
away
,
"
say
Peggotty
,
"
I
be
thankful
to
think
!
 
<EOS>
no
,
Mr
Murdstone
,
I
have
not
worrite
and
frighten
any
sweet
creetur
to
an
early
grave
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
eye
her
gloomily
---
remorsefully
I
think
---
for
an
instant
;
and
say
,
turn
his
head
towards
me
,
but
look
at
my
foot
instead
of
my
face
:
   
<EOS>
"
We
be
not
likely
to
encounter
soon
again
;
---
a
source
of
satisfaction
to
us
both
,
no
doubt
,
for
such
meeting
as
this
can
never
be
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
expect
that
you
,
who
always
rebel
against
my
just
authority
,
exert
for
your
benefit
and
reformation
,
should
owe
me
any
good
-
will
now
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
antipathy
between
us
---
"
   
"
an
old
one
,
I
believe
?
"
say
I
,
interrupt
him
.
   
<EOS>
He
smile
,
and
shoot
as
evil
a
glance
at
me
as
could
come
from
his
dark
eye
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
rankle
in
your
baby
breast
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
embitter
the
life
of
your
poor
mother

<EOS>
You
be
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
may
do
better
,
yet
;
I
hope
you
may
correct
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
here
he
end
the
dialogue
,
which
have
be
carry
on
in
a
low
voice
,
in
a
corner
of
the
outer
office
,
by
pass
into
Mr
Spenlow
's
room
,
and
say
aloud
,
in
his
smooth
manner
:
   
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
of
Mr
Spenlow
's
profession
be
accustomed
to
family
difference
,
and
know
how
complicated
and
difficult
they
always
be
!
"
<EOS>
with
that
,
he
pay
the
money
for
his
licence
;
and
,
receive
it
neatly
fold
from
Mr
Spenlow
,
together
with
a
shake
of
the
hand
,
and
a
polite
wish
for
his
happiness
and
the
lady
's
,
go
out
of
the
office
.
   
<EOS>
I
may
have
have
more
difficulty
in
constrain
myself
to
be
silent
under
his
word
,
if
I
have
have
less
difficulty
in
impress
upon
Peggotty
(
who
be
only
angry
on
my
account
,
good
creature
!
)
<EOS>
that
we
be
not
in
a
place
for
recrimination
,
and
that
I
beseech
her
to
hold
her
peace
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
so
unusually
rouse
,
that
I
be
glad
to
compound
for
an
affectionate
hug
,
elicit
by
this
revival
in
her
mind
of
our
old
injury
,
and
to
make
the
good
I
could
of
it
,
before
Mr
Spenlow
and
the
clerk
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
do
not
appear
to
know
what
the
connexion
between
Mr
Murdstone
and
myself
be
;
which
I
be
glad
of
,
for
I
could
not
bear
to
acknowledge
him
,
even
in
my
own
breast
,
remember
what
I
do
of
the
history
of
my
poor
mother
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
seem
to
think
,
if
he
think
anything
about
the
matter
,
that
my
aunt
be
the
leader
of
the
state
party
in
our
family
,
and
that
there
be
a
rebel
party
command
by
somebody
else
---
so
I
gather
at
least
from
what
he
say
,
while
we
be
wait
for
Mr
Tiffey
to
make
out
Peggotty
's
bill
of
cost
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Trotwood
,
"
he
remark
,
"
be
very
firm
,
no
doubt
,
and
not
likely
to
give
way
to
opposition

<EOS>
I
have
an
admiration
for
her
character
,
and
I
may
congratulate
you
,
Copperfield
,
on
be
on
the
right
side

<EOS>
difference
between
relation
be
much
to
be
deplore
---
but
they
be
extremely
general
---
and
the
great
thing
be
,
to
be
on
the
right
side
"
:
<EOS>
meaning
<EOS>
,
I
take
it
,
on
the
side
of
the
moneyed
interest
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
rather
a
good
marriage
this
<EOS>
,
I
believe
?
"
say
Mr
Spenlow
.
   
<EOS>
I
explain
that
I
know
nothing
about
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
speak
from
the
few
word
Mr
Murdstone
drop
---
as
a
man
frequently
do
on
these
occasion

and
from
what
Miss
Murdstone
let
fall
,
I
should
say
it
be
rather
a
good
marriage
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
mean
that
there
be
money
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Mr
Spenlow
,
"
I
understand
there
be
money

<EOS>
Beauty
too

I
be
tell
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
be
his
new
wife
young
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
just
of
age
,
"
say
Mr
Spenlow
.
 
<EOS>
"
so
lately
,
that
I
should
think
they
have
be
wait
for
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
deliver
her
!
"
say
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
so
very
emphatically
and
unexpectedly
,
that
we
be
all
three
discompose
;
until
Tiffey
come
in
with
the
bill
.
   
<EOS>
Old
Tiffey
soon
appear
,
however
,
and
hand
it
to
Mr
Spenlow
,
to
look
over
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
,
settle
his
chin
in
his
cravat
and
rub
it
softly
,
go
over
the
item
with
a
deprecatory
air
---
as
if
it
be
all
Jorkins
's
doing
---
and
hand
it
back
to
Tiffey
with
a
bland
sigh
.
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
right
.
 
<EOS>
quite
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
be
extremely
happy
,
<EOS>
Copperfield
,
to
have
limit
these
charge
to
the
actual
expenditure
out
of
pocket
,
but
it
be
an
irksome
incident
in
my
professional
life
,
that
I
be
not
at
liberty
to
consult
my
own
wish
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
partner
---
Mr
Jorkins
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
as
he
say
this
with
a
gentle
melancholy
,
which
be
the
next
thing
to
make
no
charge
at
all
,
I
express
my
acknowledgement
on
Peggotty
's
behalf
,
and
pay
Tiffey
in
banknote
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
then
retire
to
her
lodging
,
and
Mr
Spenlow
<EOS>
and
I
go
into
Court
,
where
we
have
a
divorce
-
suit
come
on
,
under
an
ingenious
little
statute
(
repeal
now
,
I
believe
,
but
in
virtue
of
which
I
have
see
several
marriage
annul
)
,
of
which
the
merit
be
these
.
<EOS>
the
husband
,
whose
name
be
Thomas
Benjamin
,
have
take
out
his
marriage
licence
as
Thomas
only
;
suppress
the
Benjamin
,
in
case
he
should
not
find
himself
as
comfortable
as
he
expect
.
 
<EOS>
not
find
himself
as
comfortable
as
he
expect
,
or
be
a
little
fatigued
with
his
wife
,
poor
fellow
,
he
now
come
forward
,
by
a
friend
,
after
be
marry
a
year
or
two
,
and
declare
that
his
name
be
Thomas
Benjamin
,
and
therefore
he
be
not
marry
at
all
.
<EOS>
which
the
Court
confirm
,
to
his
great
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
I
must
say
that
I
have
my
doubt
about
the
strict
justice
of
this
,
and
be
not
even
frighten
out
of
them
by
the
bushel
of
wheat
which
reconcile
all
anomaly
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mr
Spenlow
argue
the
matter
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
look
at
the
world
,
there
be
good
and
evil
in
that
;
look
at
the
ecclesiastical
law
,
there
be
good
and
evil
in
that
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
all
part
of
a
system
.
 
<EOS>
very
good
.
 
<EOS>
there
you
be
!
   
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
hardihood
to
suggest
to
Dora
's
father
that
possibly
we
may
even
improve
the
world
a
little
,
if
we
get
up
early
in
the
morning
,
and
take
off
our
coat
to
the
work
;
but
I
confess
that
I
think
we
may
improve
the
Commons
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
reply
that
he
would
particularly
advise
me
to
dismiss
that
idea
from
my
mind
,
as
not
be
worthy
of
my
gentlemanly
character
;
but
that
he
would
be
glad
to
hear
from
me
of
what
improvement
<EOS>
I
think
the
Commons
susceptible
?
   
<EOS>
take
that
part
of
the
Commons
which
happen
to
be
near
to
us
---
for
our
man
be
unmarried
by
this
time
,
and
we
be
out
of
Court
,
and
stroll
past
the
Prerogative
Office
<EOS>
---
I
submit
that
I
think
the
Prerogative
Office
rather
a
queerly
manage
institution
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
inquire
in
what
respect
?
 
<EOS>
I
reply
,
with
all
due
deference
to
his
experience
(
but
with
more
deference
,
I
be
afraid
,
to
his
be
Dora
's
father
)
,
that
perhaps
it
be
a
little
nonsensical
that
the
Registry
of
that
Court
,
contain
the
original
will
of
all
person
leave
effect
within
the
immense
province
of
Canterbury
,
for
three
whole
century
<EOS>
,
should
be
an
accidental
building
,
never
design
for
the
purpose
,
lease
by
the
registrar
for
their
own
private
emolument
,
unsafe
,
not
even
ascertain
to
be
fire
-
proof
,
choke
with
the
important
document
it
hold
,
and
positively
,
from
the
roof
to
the
basement
,
a
mercenary
speculation
of
the
registrar
,
who
take
great
fee
from
the
public
,
and
cram
the
public
's
will
away
anyhow
and
anywhere
,
have
no
other
object
than
to
get
rid
of
them
cheaply
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
perhaps
,
it
be
a
little
unreasonable
that
these
registrar
in
the
receipt
of
profit
amount
to
eight
or
nine
thousand
pound
a
year
(
to
say
nothing
of
the
profit
of
the
deputy
registrar
,
and
clerk
of
seat
)
,
should
not
be
oblige
to
spend
a
little
of
that
money
,
in
find
a
reasonably
safe
place
for
the
important
document
which
all
class
of
people
be
compel
to
hand
over
to
them
,
whether
they
would
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
perhaps
,
it
be
a
little
unjust
,
that
all
the
great
office
in
this
great
office
should
be
magnificent
sinecure
,
while
the
unfortunate
working
-
clerk
in
the
cold
dark
room
upstairs
be
the
worst
reward
,
and
the
least
consider
man
,
do
important
service
,
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
that
perhaps
it
be
a
little
indecent
that
the
principal
registrar
of
all
,
whose
duty
it
be
to
find
the
public
,
constantly
resort
to
this
place
,
all
needful
accommodation
,
should
be
an
enormous
sinecurist
in
virtue
of
that
post
(
and
may
be
,
besides
,
a
clergyman
,
a
pluralist
,
the
holder
of
a
staff
in
a
cathedral
,
and
what
not
)
,
---
while
the
public
be
put
to
the
inconvenience
of
which
we
have
a
speciman
every
afternoon
when
the
office
be
busy
,
and
which
we
know
to
be
quite
monstrous
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
perhaps
,
in
short
,
this
Prerogative
Office
of
the
diocese
of
Canterbury
be
altogether
such
a
pestilent
job
,
and
such
a
pernicious
absurdity
,
that
but
for
its
be
squeeze
away
in
a
corner
of
St
Paul
's
Churchyard
,
which
few
people
know
,
it
must
have
be
turn
completely
inside
out
,
and
upside
down
,
long
ago
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
smile
as
I
become
modestly
warm
on
the
subject
,
and
then
argue
this
question
with
me
as
he
have
argue
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
what
be
it
after
all
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
question
of
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
public
feel
that
their
will
be
in
safe
keeping
,
and
take
it
for
grant
that
the
office
be
not
to
be
make
well
,
<EOS>
who
be
the
bad
for
it
?
 
<EOS>
nobody
.
 
<EOS>
who
be
the
well
for
it
?
 
<EOS>
all
the
Sinecurists
.
 
<EOS>
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
good
predominate
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
not
be
a
perfect
system
;
nothing
be
perfect
;
but
what
he
object
to
,
be
,
the
insertion
of
the
wedge
.
 
<EOS>
under
the
Prerogative
Office
,
the
country
have
be
glorious
.
 
<EOS>
insert
the
wedge
into
the
Prerogative
Office
,
and
the
country
would
cease
to
be
glorious
.
 
<EOS>
He
consider
it
the
principle
of
a
gentleman
to
take
thing
as
he
find
them
;
and
he
have
no
doubt
the
Prerogative
Office
would
last
our
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
defer
to
his
opinion
,
though
I
have
great
doubt
of
it
myself
.
<EOS>
I
find
he
be
right
,
however
;
for
it
have
not
only
last
to
the
present
moment
,
but
have
do
so
in
the
tooth
of
a
great
parliamentary
report
make
(
not
too
willingly
)
eighteen
year
ago
,
when
all
these
objection
of
mine
be
set
forth
in
detail
,
and
when
the
exist
stowage
for
will
be
describe
as
equal
to
the
accumulation
of
only
two
year
and
a
half
more
.
 
<EOS>
what
they
have
do
with
them
since
;
whether
they
have
lose
many
,
or
whether
they
sell
any
,
now
and
then
,
to
the
butter
shop
;
I
do
not
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
mine
be
not
there
,
and
I
hope
it
may
not
go
there
,
yet
awhile
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
set
all
this
down
,
in
my
present
blissful
chapter
,
because
here
it
come
into
its
natural
place
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
and
<EOS>
I
fall
into
this
conversation
,
prolong
it
and
our
saunter
to
and
fro
,
until
we
diverge
into
general
topic
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
it
come
about
<EOS>
,
in
the
end
,
that
Mr
Spenlow
tell
me
this
day
week
be
Dora
's
birthday
,
and
he
would
be
glad
if
I
would
come
down
and
join
a
little
picnic
on
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
out
of
my
sense
immediately
;
become
a
mere
driveller
next
day
,
on
receipt
of
a
little
lace
-
edge
sheet
of
note
-
paper
,
"
favour
by
papa
.
 
<EOS>
to
remind
"
;
and
pass
the
intervene
period
in
a
state
of
dotage
.
   
<EOS>
I
think
I
commit
every
possible
absurdity
in
the
way
of
preparation
for
this
blessed
event
.
 
<EOS>
I
turn
hot
when
I
remember
the
cravat
I
buy
.
 
<EOS>
My
boot
may
be
place
in
any
collection
of
instrument
of
torture
.
 
<EOS>
I
provide
,
and
send
down
by
the
Norwood
coach
the
night
before
,
a
delicate
little
hamper
,
amount
in
itself
,
I
think
,
almost
to
a
declaration
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
cracker
in
it
with
the
tender
motto
that
could
be
get
for
money
.
 
<EOS>
at
six
in
the
morning
,
I
be
in
Covent
Garden
Market
,
buy
a
bouquet
for
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
at
ten
I
be
on
horseback
<EOS>
(
I
hire
a
gallant
grey
,
for
the
occasion
)
,
with
the
bouquet
in
my
hat
,
to
keep
it
fresh
,
trot
down
to
Norwood
.
   
<EOS>
I
suppose
that
when
I
see
Dora
in
the
garden
and
pretend
not
to
see
her
,
and
ride
past
the
house
pretend
to
be
anxiously
look
for
it
,
I
commit
two
small
foolery
which
other
young
gentleman
in
my
circumstance
may
have
commit
---
because
they
come
so
very
natural
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
when
I
do
find
the
house
,
and
DID
dismount
at
the
garden
-
gate
,
and
drag
those
stony
-
hearte
boot
across
the
lawn
to
Dora
sit
on
a
garden
-
seat
under
a
lilac
tree
,
what
a
spectacle
she
be
,
upon
that
beautiful
morning
,
among
the
butterfly
,
in
a
white
chip
bonnet
and
a
dress
of
celestial
blue
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
young
lady
with
her
---
comparatively
stricken
in
year
---
almost
twenty
,
I
should
say
.
 
<EOS>
Her
name
be
Miss
Mills
.
 
<EOS>
and
Dora
call
her
Julia
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
the
bosom
friend
of
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
Happy
Miss
Mills
!
   
<EOS>
Jip
be
there
,
and
Jip
WOULD
bark
at
me
again
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
present
my
bouquet
,
he
gnash
his
tooth
with
jealousy
.
 
<EOS>
well
he
may
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
the
least
idea
how
I
adore
his
mistress
,
well
he
may
!
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
thank
you
,
Mr
Copperfield
!
 
<EOS>
what
dear
flower
!
"
say
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
have
an
intention
of
say
(
and
have
be
study
the
good
form
of
word
for
three
mile
)
<EOS>
that
I
think
them
beautiful
before
I
see
them
so
near
HER
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
manage
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
too
bewildering
.
 
<EOS>
to
see
her
lay
the
flower
against
her
little
dimpled
chin
,
be
to
lose
all
presence
of
mind
and
power
of
language
in
a
feeble
ecstasy
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
I
do
not
say
,
"
kill
me
,
if
you
have
a
heart
,
Miss
Mills
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
die
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
then
Dora
hold
my
flower
to
Jip
to
smell
.
 
<EOS>
then
Jip
growl
,
and
would
not
smell
them
.
 
<EOS>
then
Dora
laugh
,
and
hold
them
a
little
closer
to
Jip
,
to
make
him
.
 
<EOS>
then
Jip
lay
hold
of
a
bit
of
geranium
with
his
tooth
,
and
worried
imaginary
cat
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
then
Dora
beat
him
,
and
pout
,
and
say
,
"
My
poor
beautiful
flower
!
"
<EOS>
as
compassionately
,
I
think
,
as
if
Jip
have
lay
hold
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
he
have
!
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
so
glad
to
hear
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
say
Dora
,
"
that
that
cross
Miss
Murdstone
be
not
here
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
go
to
her
brother
's
marriage
,
and
will
be
away
at
least
three
week
.
 
<EOS>
be
not
that
delightful
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
say
I
be
sure
it
must
be
delightful
to
her
,
and
all
that
be
delightful
to
her
be
delightful
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
,
with
an
air
of
superior
wisdom
and
benevolence
,
smile
upon
us
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
be
the
most
disagreeable
thing
I
ever
see
,
"
say
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
believe
how
ill
-
tempered
and
shocking
<EOS>
she
be
,
Julia
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
can
,
my
dear
!
"
say
Julia
.
   
<EOS>
"
you
can
,
perhaps
,
love
,
"
return
Dora
,
with
her
hand
on
julia
's
.
<EOS>
"
forgive
my
not
except
you
,
my
dear
,
at
first
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
learn
,
from
this
,
that
Miss
Mills
have
have
her
trial
in
the
course
of
a
chequer
existence
;
and
that
to
these
,
perhaps
,
I
may
refer
that
wise
benignity
of
manner
which
I
have
already
notice
.
 
<EOS>
i
find
,
in
the
course
of
the
day
,
that
this
be
the
case
:
Miss
Mills
have
be
unhappy
in
a
misplaced
affection
,
and
be
understand
to
have
retire
from
the
world
on
her
awful
stock
of
experience
,
but
still
to
take
a
calm
interest
in
the
unblighted
hope
and
love
of
youth
.
   
<EOS>
but
now
Mr
Spenlow
come
out
of
the
house
,
and
Dora
go
to
him
,
say
,
"
look
,
papa
,
what
beautiful
flower
!
"
<EOS>
and
Miss
Mills
smile
thoughtfully
,
as
who
should
say
,
"
Ye
Mayflies
,
enjoy
your
brief
existence
in
the
bright
morning
of
life
!
"
<EOS>
and
we
all
walk
from
the
lawn
towards
the
carriage
,
which
be
get
ready
.
   
<EOS>
I
shall
never
have
such
a
ride
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
have
such
another
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
only
those
three
,
their
hamper
,
my
hamper
,
and
the
guitar
-
case
,
in
the
phaeton
;
and
,
of
course
,
the
phaeton
be
open
;
and
I
ride
behind
it
,
and
Dora
sit
with
her
back
to
the
horse
,
look
towards
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
keep
the
bouquet
close
to
her
on
the
cushion
,
and
would
not
allow
Jip
to
sit
on
that
side
of
her
at
all
,
for
fear
he
should
crush
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
often
carry
it
in
her
hand
,
often
refresh
herself
with
its
fragrance
.
 
<EOS>
Our
eye
at
those
time
often
meet
;
and
my
great
astonishment
be
that
I
do
not
go
over
the
head
of
my
gallant
grey
into
the
carriage
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
dust
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
good
deal
of
dust
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
faint
impression
that
Mr
Spenlow
remonstrate
with
me
for
ride
in
it
;
but
I
know
of
none
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sensible
of
a
mist
of
love
and
beauty
about
Dora
,
but
of
nothing
else
.
 
<EOS>
He
stand
up
sometimes
,
and
ask
me
what
I
think
of
the
prospect
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
it
be
delightful
,
and
I
dare
say
it
be
;
but
it
be
all
Dora
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
sun
shine
Dora
,
and
the
bird
sing
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
the
south
wind
blow
Dora
,
and
the
wild
flower
in
the
hedge
be
all
Doras
,
to
a
bud
.
 
<EOS>
My
comfort
be
,
Miss
Mills
understand
me
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
alone
could
enter
into
my
feeling
thoroughly
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
long
we
be
go
,
and
to
this
hour
I
know
as
little
where
we
go
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
near
Guildford
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
some
arabian
-
night
magician
,
open
up
the
place
for
the
day
,
and
shut
it
up
for
ever
when
we
come
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
green
spot
,
on
a
hill
,
carpet
with
soft
turf
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
shady
tree
,
and
heather
,
and
,
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
,
a
rich
landscape
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
try
thing
to
find
people
here
,
wait
for
us
;
and
my
jealousy
,
even
of
the
lady
,
know
no
bound
.
 
<EOS>
but
all
of
my
own
sex
---
especially
one
impostor
,
three
or
four
year
my
elder
,
with
a
red
whisker
,
on
which
he
establish
an
amount
of
presumption
not
to
be
endure
---
be
my
mortal
foe
.
   
<EOS>
We
all
unpack
our
basket
,
and
employ
ourselves
in
get
dinner
ready
.
 
<EOS>
Red
Whisker
pretend
he
could
make
a
salad
(
which
I
do
not
believe
)
,
and
obtrude
himself
on
public
notice
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
the
young
lady
wash
the
lettuce
for
him
,
and
slice
them
under
his
direction
.
 
<EOS>
Dora
be
among
these
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
that
fate
have
pit
me
against
this
man
,
and
one
of
us
must
fall
.
   
<EOS>
Red
Whisker
make
his
salad
(
I
wonder
how
they
could
eat
it
.
<EOS>
nothing
should
have
induce
me
to
touch
it
!
)
and
vote
himself
into
the
charge
of
the
wine
-
cellar
,
which
he
construct
,
be
an
ingenious
beast
,
in
the
hollow
trunk
of
a
tree
.
 
<EOS>
by
and
by
<EOS>
,
I
see
him
,
with
the
majority
of
a
lobster
on
his
plate
,
eat
his
dinner
at
the
foot
of
Dora
!
   
<EOS>
I
have
but
<EOS>
an
indistinct
idea
of
what
happen
for
some
time
after
this
baleful
object
present
itself
to
my
view
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
merry
,
I
know
;
but
it
be
hollow
merriment
.
 
<EOS>
I
attach
myself
to
a
young
creature
in
pink
,
with
little
eye
,
and
flirt
with
her
desperately
.
 
<EOS>
She
receive
my
attention
with
favour
;
but
whether
on
my
account
solely
,
or
because
she
have
any
design
on
Red
Whisker
,
I
can
not
say
.
 
<EOS>
Dora
's
health
be
drunk
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
drink
it
,
I
affect
to
interrupt
my
conversation
for
that
purpose
,
and
to
resume
it
immediately
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
I
catch
Dora
's
eye
as
I
bow
to
her
,
and
I
think
it
look
appealing
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
look
at
me
over
the
head
of
Red
Whisker
,
and
I
be
adamant
.
   
<EOS>
the
young
creature
in
pink
have
a
mother
in
green
;
and
I
rather
think
the
latter
separate
us
from
motive
of
policy
.
 
<EOS>
Howbeit
,
there
be
a
general
break
up
of
the
party
,
while
the
remnant
of
the
dinner
be
be
put
away
;
and
I
stroll
off
by
myself
among
the
tree
,
in
a
rage
and
remorseful
state
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
debate
whether
I
should
pretend
that
I
be
not
well
,
and
fly
<EOS>
---
I
do
not
know
where
---
upon
my
gallant
grey
,
when
Dora
and
Miss
Mills
meet
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
say
Miss
Mills
,
"
you
be
dull
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
beg
her
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
not
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
Dora
,
"
say
Miss
Mills
,
"
you
be
dull
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
oh
dear
<EOS>
no
!
 
<EOS>
not
in
the
least
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
and
Dora
,
"
say
Miss
Mills
,
with
an
almost
venerable
air
.
 
<EOS>
"
enough
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
allow
a
trivial
misunderstanding
to
wither
the
blossom
of
spring
,
which
,
once
put
forth
and
blight
,
can
not
be
renew
.
 
<EOS>
I
speak
,
"
say
Miss
Mills
,
"
from
experience
of
the
past
---
the
remote
,
irrevocable
past
.
 
<EOS>
the
gushing
fountain
which
sparkle
in
the
sun
,
must
not
be
stop
in
mere
caprice
;
the
oasis
in
the
desert
of
Sahara
must
not
be
pluck
up
idly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
what
I
do
,
I
be
burn
all
over
to
that
extraordinary
extent
;
but
I
take
Dora
's
little
hand
and
kiss
it
---
and
she
let
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
kiss
Miss
Mills
's
hand
;
and
we
all
seem
,
to
my
thinking
,
to
go
straight
up
to
the
seventh
heaven
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
come
down
again
.
 
<EOS>
We
stay
up
there
all
the
evening
.
<EOS>
at
first
we
stray
to
and
fro
among
the
tree
:
<EOS>
I
with
Dora
's
shy
arm
draw
through
mine
:
and
Heaven
know
,
folly
as
it
all
be
,
it
would
have
be
a
happy
fate
to
have
be
strike
immortal
with
those
foolish
feeling
,
and
have
stay
among
the
tree
for
ever
!
   
<EOS>
but
,
much
too
soon
,
we
hear
the
other
laugh
and
talk
,
and
call
"
where
be
Dora
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
we
go
back
,
and
they
want
Dora
to
sing
.
 
<EOS>
Red
Whisker
would
have
get
the
guitar
-
case
out
of
the
carriage
,
but
Dora
tell
him
nobody
know
where
it
be
,
but
I.
 
so
Red
Whisker
be
do
for
in
a
moment
;
and
I
get
it
,
and
I
unlock
it
,
and
I
take
the
guitar
out
,
and
I
sit
by
her
,
and
I
hold
her
handkerchief
and
glove
,
and
I
drink
in
every
note
of
her
dear
voice
,
and
she
sing
to
me
who
love
her
,
and
all
the
other
may
applaud
as
much
as
they
like
,
but
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
!
   
<EOS>
I
be
intoxicate
with
joy
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
it
be
too
happy
to
be
real
,
and
that
I
should
wake
in
Buckingham
Street
presently
,
and
hear
Mrs
Crupp
clink
the
teacup
in
get
breakfast
ready
.
<EOS>
but
Dora
sing
,
and
other
sing
,
and
Miss
Mills
sing
---
about
the
slumber
echo
in
the
cavern
of
memory
;
as
if
she
be
a
hundred
year
old
---
and
the
evening
come
on
;
and
we
have
tea
,
with
the
kettle
boil
gipsy
-
fashion
;
and
I
be
still
as
happy
as
ever
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
happy
than
ever
when
the
party
break
up
,
and
the
other
people
,
defeat
Red
Whisker
and
all
,
go
their
several
way
,
and
we
go
ours
through
the
still
evening
and
the
die
light
,
with
sweet
scent
rise
up
around
us
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
be
a
little
drowsy
after
the
champagne
---
honour
to
the
soil
that
grow
the
grape
,
to
the
grape
that
make
the
wine
,
to
the
sun
that
ripen
it
,
and
to
the
merchant
who
adulterate
it
!
<EOS>
---
and
be
fast
asleep
in
a
corner
of
the
carriage
,
I
ride
by
the
side
and
talk
to
Dora
.
<EOS>
She
admire
my
horse
and
pat
him
---
<EOS>
oh
,
what
a
dear
little
hand
it
look
upon
a
horse
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
her
shawl
would
not
keep
right
,
and
now
<EOS>
and
then
I
draw
it
round
her
with
my
arm
;
and
I
even
fancy
that
Jip
begin
to
see
how
it
be
,
and
to
understand
that
he
must
make
up
his
mind
to
be
friend
with
me
.
   
<EOS>
that
sagacious
Miss
Mills
,
too
;
that
amiable
,
though
quite
use
up
,
recluse
;
that
little
patriarch
of
something
less
than
twenty
,
who
have
do
with
the
world
,
and
must
not
on
any
account
have
the
slumber
echo
in
the
cavern
of
memory
awaken
;
what
a
kind
thing
she
do
!
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
say
Miss
Mills
,
"
come
to
this
side
of
the
carriage
a
moment

if
you
can
spare
a
moment

<EOS>
I
want
to
speak
to
you

"
   
<EOS>
Behold
me
,
on
my
gallant
grey
,
bend
at
the
side
of
Miss

with
my

upon

<EOS>
She
be
come
home
with
me
the
day
after
tomorrow

<EOS>
if
you
would
like
to
call
,
I
be
sure
papa
would
be
happy
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
"
what
could
I
do
but
invoke
a
silent
blessing
on
Miss
Mills
's
head
,
and
store
Miss
Mills
's
address
in
the
secure
corner
of
my
memory
!
<EOS>
what
could
I
do
but
tell
Miss
Mills
,
with
grateful
look
and
fervent
word
,
how
much
I
appreciate
her
good
office
,
and
what
an
inestimable
value
I
set
upon
her
friendship
!
   
<EOS>
then
Miss
Mills
benignantly
dismiss
me
,
say
,
"
go
back
to
Dora
!
"
<EOS>
and
I
go
;
and
Dora
lean
out
of
the
carriage
to
talk
to
me
,
and
we
talk
all
the
rest
of
the
way
;
and
I
ride
my
gallant
grey
so
close
to
the
wheel
that
I
graze
his
near
fore
leg
against
it
,
and
"
take
the
bark
off
"
,
as
his
owner
tell
me
,
"
to
the
tune
of
three
pun
'
sivin
"
---
which
I
pay
,
and
think
extremely
cheap
for
so
much
joy
.
 
<EOS>
what
time
Miss
Mills
sit
look
at
the
moon
,
murmuring
verse
---
and
recalling
,
I
suppose
,
the
ancient
day
when
she
and
earth
have
anything
in
common
.
   
<EOS>
Norwood
be
many
mile
too
near
,
and
we
reach
it
many
hour
too
soon
;
but
Mr
Spenlow
come
to
himself
a
little
short
of
it
,
and
say
,
"
You
must
come
in
,
Copperfield
,
and
rest
!
"
<EOS>
and
I
consent
,
we
have
sandwich
and
wine
-
and
-
water
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
light
room
,
Dora
blush
look
so
lovely
,
that
I
could
not
tear
myself
away
,
but
sit
there
stare
,
in
a
dream
,
until
the
snoring
of
Mr
Spenlow
inspire
me
with
sufficient
consciousness
to
take
my
leave
.
 
<EOS>
so
we
part
<EOS>
;
I
ride
all
the
way
to
London
with
the
farewell
touch
of
Dora
's
hand
still
light
on
mine
,
recall
every
incident
and
word
ten
thousand
time
;
lie
down
in
my
own
bed
at
last
,
as
enrapture
a
young
noodle
as
ever
be
carry
out
of
his
five
wit
by
love
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
awake
next
morning
,
I
be
resolute
to
declare
my
passion
to
Dora
,
and
know
my
fate
.
 
<EOS>
happiness
or
misery
be
now
the
question
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
other
question
that
I
know
of
in
the
world
,
and
only
Dora
could
give
the
answer
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
pass
three
day
in
a
luxury
of
wretchedness
,
torture
myself
by
put
every
conceivable
variety
of
discourage
construction
on
all
that
ever
have
take
place
between
Dora
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
array
for
the
purpose
at
a
vast
expense
,
I
go
to
Miss
Mills
's
,
fraught
with
a
declaration
.
   
<EOS>
how
many
time
I
go
up
and
down
the
street
,
and
round
the
square
---
painfully
aware
of
be
a
much
well
answer
to
the
old
riddle
than
the
original
one
---
before
I
could
persuade
myself
to
go
up
the
step
and
knock
,
be
no
matter
now
.
 
<EOS>
even
when
,
at
last
,
I
have
knock
,
and
be
wait
at
the
door
,
I
have
some
flurry
thought
of
ask
if
that
be
Mr
Blackboy
's
<EOS>
(
in
imitation
of
poor
Barkis
)
,
beg
pardon
,
and
retreat
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
keep
my
ground
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Mills
be
not
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
expect
he
would
be
.
 
<EOS>
nobody
want
him
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
be
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
would
do
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
show
into
a
room
upstairs
,
where
Miss
Mills
and
Dora
be
.
<EOS>
Jip
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
be
copy
music
<EOS>
(
I
recollect
,
it
be
a
new
song
,
call
"
affection
's
Dirge
"
)
,
and
Dora
be
paint
flower
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
my
feeling
,
when
I
recognize
my
own
flower
;
the
identical
Covent
Garden
Market
purchase
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
they
be
very
like
,
or
that
they
particularly
resemble
any
flower
that
have
ever
come
under
my
observation
;
but
I
know
from
the
paper
round
them
which
be
accurately
copy
,
what
the
composition
be
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
be
very
glad
to
see
me
,
and
very
sorry
her
papa
be
not
at
home
:
though
I
think
we
all
bear
that
with
fortitude
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
be
conversational
for
a
few
minute
,
and
then
,
lay
down
her
pen
upon
"
Affection
's
Dirge
"
,
get
up
,
and
leave
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
I
would
put
it
off
till
tomorrow
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
your
poor
horse
be
not
tired
,
when
he
get
home
at
night
,
"
say
Dora
,
lift
up
her
beautiful
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
long
way
for
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
I
would
do
it
today
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
long
way
for
him
,
"
say
I
,
"
for
he
have
nothing
to
uphold
him
on
the
journey
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
be
not
he
feed
,
poor
thing
?
"
ask
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
I
would
put
it
off
till
tomorrow
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ye
-
yes
,
"
I
say
,
"
he
be
well
take
care
of
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
he
have
not
the
unutterable
happiness
that
I
have
in
be
so
near
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Dora
bend
her
head
over
her
drawing
and
say
,
after
a
little
while
---
I
have
sit
,
in
the
interval
,
in
a
burn
fever
,
and
with
my
leg
in
a
very
rigid
state
---
   
"
You
do
not
seem
to
be
sensible
of
that
happiness
yourself
,
at
one
time
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
see
now
that
I
be
in
for
it
,
and
it
must
be
do
on
the
spot
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
care
for
that
happiness
in
the
least
,
"
say
Dora
,
slightly
raise
her
eyebrow
,
and
shake
her
head
,
"
when
you
be
sit
by
Miss
Kitt
.
"
   
<EOS>
Kitt
,
I
should
observe
,
be
the
name
of
the
creature
in
pink
,
with
the
little
eye
.
   
<EOS>
"
though
certainly
I
do
not
know
why
you
should
,
"
say
Dora
,
"
or
why
you
should
call
it
a
happiness
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
but
of
course
you
do
not
mean
what
you
say
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
sure
no
one
doubt
your
being
at
liberty
to
do
whatever
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
Jip
<EOS>
,
you
naughty
boy
,
come
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
I
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
it
in
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
I
intercept
Jip
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
Dora
in
my
arm
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
full
of
eloquence
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
stop
for
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
how
I
love
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
I
should
die
without
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
that
I
idolize
and
worship
her
.
 
<EOS>
Jip
bark
madly
all
the
time

<EOS>
when
Dora
hang
her
head
and
cry
,
and
tremble

my
eloquence
increase
so
much
the
more
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
would
like
me
to
die
for
her
,
she
have
but
<EOS>
to
say
the
word
,
and
I
be
ready
.
 
<EOS>
life
without
Dora
's
love
be
not
a
thing
to
have
on
any
term
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
it
,
and
I
would
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
love
her
every
minute
,
day
and
night
,
since
I
first
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
her
at
that
minute
to
distraction
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
always
love
her
,
every
minute
,
to
distraction
.
 
<EOS>
Lovers
have
love
before
,
and
lover
would
love
again
;
but
no
lover
have
love
,
may
,
could
,
would
,
or
should
ever
love
,
as
I
love
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
the
more
I
rave
,
the
more
Jip
bark
.
 
<EOS>
each
of
us
,
in
his
own
way
,
get
more
mad
every
moment
.
   
<EOS>
well
,
well
!
 
<EOS>
Dora
and
I
be
sit
on
the
sofa
by
and
by
,
quiet
enough
,
and
Jip
be
lie
in
her
lap
,
wink
peacefully
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
off
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
in
a
state
of
perfect
rapture
.
 
<EOS>
Dora
and
I
be
engage
.
   
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
have
some
notion
that
this
be
to
end
in
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
have
have
some
,
because
Dora
stipulate
that
we
be
never
to
be
marry
without
her
papa
's
consent
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
in
our
youthful
ecstasy
,
I
do
not
think
that
we
really
look
before
us
or
behind
us
;
or
have
any
aspiration
beyond
the
ignorant
present
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
to
keep
our
secret
from
Mr
Spenlow
;
but
I
be
sure
the
idea
never
enter
my
head
,
then
,
that
there
be
anything
dishonourable
in
that
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
be
more
than
usually
pensive
when
Dora
,
go
to
find
her
,
bring
her
back
;
---
I
apprehend
,
because
there
be
a
tendency
in
what
have
pass
to
awaken
the
slumber
echo
in
the
cavern
of
memory
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
give
us
her
blessing
,
and
the
assurance
of
her
last
friendship
,
and
speak
to
us
,
generally
,
as
become
a
Voice
from
the
Cloister
.
   
<EOS>
what
an
idle
time
it
be
!
 
<EOS>
what
an
insubstantial
,
happy
,
foolish
time
it
be
!
   
<EOS>
when
I
measure
Dora
's
finger
for
a
ring
that
be
to
be
make
of
forget
-
me
-
not
,
and
when
the
jeweller
,
to
whom
I
take
the
measure
,
find
me
out
,
and
laugh
over
his
order
-
book
,
and
charge
me
anything
he
like
for
the
pretty
little
toy
,
with
its
blue
stone
---
so
associated
in
my
remembrance
with
Dora
's
hand
,
that
yesterday
,
when
I
see
such
another
,
by
chance
,
on
the
finger
of
my
own
daughter
,
there
be
a
momentary
stirring
in
my
heart
,
like
pain
!
   
<EOS>
when
I
walk
about
,
exalt
with
my
secret
,
and
full
of
my
own
interest
,
and
feel
the
dignity
of
love
Dora
,
and
of
be
beloved
,
so
much
,
that
if
I
have
walk
the
air
,
I
could
not
have
be
more
above
the
people
not
so
situated
,
who
be
creep
on
the
earth
!
   
<EOS>
when
we
have
those
meeting
in
the
garden
of
the
square
,
and
sit
within
the
dingy
summer
-
house
,
so
happy
,
that
I
love
the
London
sparrow
to
this
hour
,
for
nothing
else
,
and
see
the
plumage
of
the
tropic
in
their
smoky
feather
!
<EOS>
when
we
have
our
first
great
quarrel
(
within
a
week
of
our
betrothal
)
,
and
when
Dora
send
me
back
the
ring
,
enclose
in
a
despairing
cock
-
hat
note
,
wherein
she
use
the
terrible
expression
that
"
our
love
have
begin
in
folly
,
and
end
in
madness
!
"
<EOS>
which
dreadful
word
occasion
me
to
tear
my
hair
,
and
cry
that
all
be
over
!
   
<EOS>
when
,
under
cover
of
the
night
,
I
fly
to
Miss
Mills
,
whom
I
see
by
stealth
in
a
back
kitchen
where
there
be
a
mangle
,
and
implore
Miss
Mills
to
interpose
between
us
and
avert
insanity
.
 
<EOS>
when
Miss
Mills
undertake
the
office
and
return
with
Dora
,
exhort
us
,
from
the
pulpit
of
her
own
bitter
youth
,
to
mutual
concession
,
and
the
avoidance
of
the

Chapter
34
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
astonish
me
 
<EOS>
I
write
to
Agnes
as
soon
as
Dora
and
I
be
engage
.
 
<EOS>
I
write
her
a
long
letter
,
in
which
I
try
to
make
her
comprehend
how
bl
I
be
,
and
what
a
darle
Dora
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
entreat
agne
not
to
regard
this
as
a
thoughtless
passion
which
could
ever
yield
to
any
other
,
or
have
the
least
resemblance
to
the
boyish
fancy
that
we
use
to
joke
about
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
her
that
its
profundity
be
quite
unfathomable
,
and
express
my
belief
that
nothing
like
it
have
ever
be
know
.
   
<EOS>
somehow
,
as
I
write
to
Agnes
on
a
fine
evening
by
my
open
window
,
and
the
remembrance
of
her
clear
calm
eye
and
gentle
face
come
steal
over
me
,
it
shed
such
a
peaceful
influence
upon
the
hurry
and
agitation
in
which
I
have
be
live
lately
,
and
of
which
my
very
happiness
partook
in
some
degree
,
that
it
soothe
me
into
tear
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
that
I
sit
rest
my
head
upon
my
hand
,
when
the
letter
be
half
do
,
cherish
a
general
fancy
as
if
agne
be
one
of
the
element
of
my
natural
home
.
 
<EOS>
as
if
,
in
the
retirement
of
the
house
make
almost
sacred
to
me
by
her
presence
,
Dora
and
I
must
be
happy
than
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
as
if
,
in
love
,
joy
,
sorrow
,
hope
,
or
disappointment
;
in
all
emotion
;
my
heart
turn
naturally
there
,
and
find
its
refuge
and
good
friend
.
   
<EOS>
of
Steerforth
I
say
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
tell
her
there
have
be
sad
grief
at
Yarmouth
,
on
account
of
Emily
's
flight
;
and
that
on
me
it
make
a
double
wound
,
by
reason
of
the
circumstance
attend
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
how
quick
she
always
be
to
divine
the
truth
,
and
that
she
would
never
be
the
first
to
breathe
his
name
.
   
<EOS>
to
this
letter
,
I
receive
an
answer
by
return
of
post
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
read
it
,
I
seem
to
hear
Agnes
speak
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
like
her
cordial
voice
in
my
ear
.
 
<EOS>
what
can
I
say
more
!
   
<EOS>
while
I
have
be
away
from
home
lately
,
Traddles
have
call
twice
or
thrice
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
Peggotty
within
,
and
be
inform
by
Peggotty
(
who
always
volunteer
that
information
to
whomsoever
would
receive
it
)
,
<EOS>
that
she
be
my
old
nurse
,
he
have
establish
a
good
-
humoured
acquaintance
with
her
,
and
have
stay
to
have
a
little
chat
with
her
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
so
Peggotty
say
;
<EOS>
but
I
be
afraid
the
chat
be
all
on
her
own
side
,
and
of
immoderate
length
,
as
she
be
very
difficult
indeed
to
stop
,
God
bless
her
!
<EOS>
when
she
have
me
for
her
theme
.
   
<EOS>
this
remind
me
,
not
only
that
I
expect
Traddles
on
a
certain
afternoon
of
his
own
appointing
,
which
be
now
come
,
but
that
Mrs
Crupp
have
resign
everything
appertain
to
her
office
(
the
salary
except
)
until
Peggotty
should
cease
to
present
herself
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Crupp
,
after
hold
diver
conversation
respect
Peggotty
,
in
a
very
high
-
pitch
voice
,
on
the
staircase
---
with
some
invisible
Familiar
it
would
appear
,
for
corporeally
speak
she
be
quite
alone
at
those
time
---
address
a
letter
to
me
,
develop
her
view
.
 
<EOS>
begin
it
with
that
statement
of
universal
application
,
which
fit
every
occurrence
of
her
life
,
namely
,
that
she
be
a
mother
herself
,
she
go
on
to
inform
me
that
she
have
once
see
very
different
day
,
but
that
at
all
period
of
her
existence
she
have
have
a
constitutional
objection
to
spy
,
intruder
,
and
informer
.
 
<EOS>
She
name
no
name
<EOS>
,
she
say
;
let
them
the
cap
fit
,
wear
it
;
but
spy
,
intruder
,
and
informer
,
especially
in
widder
'
weed
<EOS>
(
this
clause
be
underline
)
,
she
have
ever
accustom
herself
to
look
down
upon
.
 
<EOS>
if
a
gentleman
be
the
victim
of
spy
,
intruder
,
and
informer
(
but
still
name
no
name
)
,
that
be
his
own
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
right
to
please
himself
;
so
let
him
do
.
 
<EOS>
all
that
she
,
Mrs
Crupp
,
stipulate
for
,
be
,
that
she
should
not
be
"
bring
in
contract
"
with
such
person
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
she
beg
to
be
excuse
from
any
further
attendance
on
the
top
set
,
until
thing
be
as
they
formerly
be
,
and
as
they
could
be
wish
to
be
;
and
further
mention
that
her
little
book
would
be
find
upon
the
breakfast
-
table
every
Saturday
morning
,
when
she
request
an
immediate
settlement
of
the
same
,
with
the
benevolent
view
of
save
trouble
"
and
an
ill
-
conwenience
"
to
all
party
.
   
<EOS>
after
this
,
Mrs
Crupp
confine
herself
to
make
pitfall
on
the
stair
,
principally
with
pitcher
,
and
endeavour
to
delude
Peggotty
into
break
her
leg
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
it
rather
harass
to
live
in
this
state
of
siege
,
but
be
too
much
afraid
of
Mrs
Crupp
to
see
any
way
out
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My

Traddles

Traddles

with
a
serious
look

down
in

I

I

you

I
return

so
seldom

"
hah
!
"
say
Traddles
,
thoughtfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
do
seem
a
wonder

I
suppose
it
be
,
Copperfield
,
because
there
be
no
help
for
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
,

I
reply
with
a
smile

and
not
without
a
blush

"
<EOS>
and
because
you
have
so
much
constancy

patience

Traddles

"
   
<EOS>
"
dear
me
!
<EOS>
"

Traddles
,
consider
about
it

do
I
strike
you
in

way

Copperfield

<EOS>
really
I
do
not
know
that
I
have

<EOS>
but
she
be
such
an
extraordinarily
dear
girl
herself
,
that
it
be
possible
she
may
have
impart
something
of
those
virtue
to
me

<EOS>
now
you
mention
it
<EOS>
,
Copperfield
,
I
should
not
wonder
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
she
be
always

herself

take
care
of
the

be
she

I

no

Traddles

the

<EOS>
He
see
,
I
suppose
,
that
I
could
not
help
smile
at
the
simplicity
of
this
reply
;
and
add
,
with
a
smile
upon
his
own
ingenuous
face
:
   
"
<EOS>
not
,
of
course
,

that
my

pretty

<EOS>
"
very
pretty

not
,
of

that

beautiful

would
be
one
of
the

ever
be

in
anybody

eye

I
should

I

he

I

you

indeed

you

for
society

not
be
able
to
enjoy
much
of

in
a
merely
domestic
view
it
be
not
so
bad
as
it
may
be

Sophy
take

may

hope
you
will
not

it
selfish

Copperfield

if
I
mention
that
the

off
my

round
table

top

pot

stand

what

indignantly

It

expression

I
do
not
mention
it
reproachfully

however

with
a
motive

<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
Copperfield
,
I
be
unable
to
repurchase
them
at
the
time
of
their
seizure
;
in
the
first
place
,
because
the
broker
,
have
an
idea
that
I
want
them
,
run
the
price
up
to
an
extravagant
extent
;
and
,
in
the
second
place
,
because
I
---
have
not
any
money
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
I
have
keep
my
eye
since
,
upon
the
broker

shop

Traddles

with
a
great
enjoyment
of
his
mystery

which
be
up
at
the
top
of
Tottenham
Court
Road
,
and
,
at
last
,
today
I
find
them
put
out
for
sale
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
notice
them
from
over
the
way
,
because
if
the
broker
see
me
,
bless
you
,
he
would
ask
any
price
for
them
!
 
<EOS>
what
have
occur
to
me
,
have
now
the
money

be
,
that
perhaps
you
would
not
object
to
ask
that
good
nurse
of
yours
to
come
with
me
to
the
shop

I
can
show
it
her

make
the
good
bargain
for
them
,
as
if
they
be
for
herself
,
that
she
can

"
   
<EOS>
the
delight
with
which
Traddles
propound
this
plan
to
me
,
and
the
sense
he
have
of
its
uncommon
artfulness
,
be
among
the
fresh
thing
in
my
remembrance
.
   
<EOS>
I
tell
him
that
my
old
nurse
would
be
delighted
to
assist
him
,
and
that
we
would
all
three
take
the
field
together
,
but
on
one
condition
.
 
<EOS>
that
condition
be
,
that
he
should
make
a
solemn
resolution
to
grant
no
more
loan
of
his
name
,
or
anything
else
,
to
Mr
Micawber
.

<EOS>
My
dear
copperfield
,
"
say
Traddles
,
"
I
have
already
do
so
,
because
I
begin
to
feel
that
I
have
not
only
be
inconsiderate
,
but
that
I
have
be
positively
unjust
to
Sophy
.
 
<EOS>
My
word
be
pass
to
myself
,
there
be
no
long
any
apprehension
;
but
I
pledge
it
to
you
,
too
,
with
the
great
readiness
.
 
<EOS>
that
first
unlucky
obligation
,
I
have
pay
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
Mr
Micawber
would
have
pay
it
if
he
could
,
but
he
could
not
.
 
<EOS>
one
thing
I
ought
to
mention
,
which
I
like
very
much
in
Mr
Micawber
,
Copperfield
.
 
<EOS>
It
refer
to
the
second
obligation
,
which
be
not
yet
due
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
tell
me
that
it
be
provide
for
,
but
he
say
it
WILL
be
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
I
think
there
be
something
very
fair
and
honest
about
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
unwilling
to
damp
my
good
friend
's
confidence
,
and
therefore
assented
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
little
further
conversation
,
we
go
round
to
the
chandler
's
shop
,
to
enlist
Peggotty
;
<EOS>
traddle
decline
to
pass
the
evening
with
me
,
both
because
he
endure
the
lively
apprehension
that
his
property
would
be
buy
by
somebody
else
before
he
could
re
-
purchase
it
,
and
because
it
be
the
evening
he
always
devote
to
write
to
the
dear
girl
in
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
I
never
shall
forget
him
peep
round
the
corner
of
the
street
in
Tottenham
Court
Road
,
while
Peggotty
be
bargain
for
the
precious
article
;
or
his
agitation
when
she
come
slowly
towards
us
after
vainly
offer
a
price
,
and
be
hail
by
the
relent
broker
,
and
go
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
the
end
of
the
negotiation
be
,
that
she
buy
the
property
on
tolerably
easy
term
,
and
Traddles
be
transport
with
pleasure
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
much
oblige
to
you
,
indeed
,
"
say
Traddles
,
on
hear
it
be
to
be
send
to
where
he
live
,
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
I
may
ask
one
other
favour
,
I
hope
you
would
not
think
it
absurd
,
Copperfield
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
say
beforehand
,
certainly
not
.
   
<EOS>
"
then
if
you
WOULD
be
good
enough
,
"
say
traddle
to
Peggotty
,
"
to
get
the
flower

pot
now
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
should
like
(
it
be
Sophy

,
Copperfield

to
carry
it
home
myself
!
"
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
be
glad
to
get
it
for
him
,
and
he
overwhelm
her
with
thank
,
and
go
his
way
up
Tottenham
Court
Road
,
carry
the
flower

pot
affectionately
in
his
arm
,
with
one
of
the
most
delighted
expression
of
countenance
I
ever
see
.
   
<EOS>
We
then
turn
back
towards
my
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
shop
have
charm
for
Peggotty
<EOS>
which
I
never
know
them
possess
in
the
same
degree
for
anybody
else
,
I
saunter
easily
along
,
amuse
by
her
staring
in
at
the
window
,
and
wait
for
her
as
often
as
she
choose
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
thus
a
good
while
in
get
to
the
Adelphi

<EOS>
on
our
way
upstairs
,
I
call
her
attention
to
the
sudden
disappearance
of
Mrs
Crupp
's
pitfall
,
and
also
to
the
print
of
recent
footstep

We
be
both
very
much
surprised

come
higher
up
,
to
find
my
outer
door
stand
open
(
which
I
have
shut
)
and
to
hear
voice
inside

<EOS>
We
look
at
one
another

without
know
what
to
make
of
this

go
into
the
sit

what
be
my

I
know
my

sufficiently
well
to
know
that

have
something
of
importance
on
her
mind
,
and
that
there
be
far
more
matter
in
this
arrival
than
a
stranger
may
have
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
I
notice
how
her
eye
light
on
me
,
when
she
think
my
attention
otherwise
occupy
;

what
a
curious
process
of
hesitation
appear
to
be
go
on
within
her

while
she
preserve
her
outward
stiffness
and
composure

<EOS>
I
begin
to
reflect
whether
I
have
do
anything
to
offend
her
;
and
my
conscience
whisper
me
that
I
have
not

tell
her
about
Dora

Could
it
by
any
mean
be
that

I
wonder

<EOS>
as
I
know
she
would
only
speak
in

good
time

I
sit
down
near
her

speak
to
the
bird
,
and
play
with
the
cat
,

be
as
easy
as
I
could
be

<EOS>
but
I
be
very
far
from
be
really
easy

I
should
still
have
be
so

even
if
Mr
Dick

lean
over
the
great

behind
my

have
not

depression
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
could
recover
my
presence
of
mind
,
which
quite
desert
me
in
the
first
overpowering
shock
of
my
aunt
's
intelligence
,
I
propose
to
Mr
Dick
to
come
round
to
the
chandler
's
shop
,
and
take
possession
of
the
bed
which
Mr
Peggotty
have
lately
vacate
.
 
<EOS>
the
chandler
's
shop
be
in
Hungerford
Market
,
and
Hungerford
Market
be
a
very
different
place
in
those
day
<EOS>
,
there
be
a
low
wooden
colonnade
before
the
door
(
not
very
unlike
that
before
the
house

the
little
man
and
woman
use
to
live
,
in
the
old
weather

glass

,
which
please
Mr
Dick
mightily

<EOS>
the
glory
of
lodge
over
this
structure
would
have
compensate
him
,
I
dare
say
,
for
many
inconvenience
;
but
,
as
there
be
really
few
to
bear
,
beyond
the
compound
of
flavour
I
have
already
mention
,
and
perhaps
the
want
of
a
little
more
elbow
-
room
,
he
be
perfectly
charm
with
his
accommodation
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Crupp
have
indignantly
assure
him
that
there
be
not
room
to
swing
a
cat
there
;

,
as
Mr

justly
observe
to
me
,
sit
down
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
nurse
his
leg
,
"
You
know

Trotwood

I
do
not
want

what
do

I
try
to
ascertain

Mr

have
any
understanding

the
cause
of
this
sudden

great
change
in
my
aunt

affair

as
I
may
have
expect

he
have
none
at
all

the

account
he
could
give

it
be
,
that
my

have
say

the
day
before
yesterday
,
"
now
,
Dick
,
be
you
really
and
truly
the
philosopher
<EOS>
I
take
you
for
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
that
then
he
have
say
,
yes
,
he
hope
so
.
 
<EOS>
that
then
my
aunt
have
say
,
"
Dick
,
I
be
ruin
.
"
 
<EOS>
that
then
he
have
say
,
"
<EOS>
oh
,
indeed
!
"
that
then
my
aunt
have
praise
him
highly
,
which
he
be
glad
of
.
 
<EOS>
and
that
then
they
have
come
to
me
,
and
have
have
bottle
porter
and
sandwich
on
the
road
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
be
so
very
complacent
,
sit
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
nurse
his
leg
,
and
tell
me
this
,
with
his
eye
wide
open
and
a
surprised
smile
,
that
I
be
sorry
to
say
I
be
provoke
into
explain
to
him
that
ruin
mean
distress
,
want
,
and
starvation
;
but
I
be
soon
bitterly
reprove
for
this
harshness
,
by
see
his
face
turn
pale
,
and
tear
course
down
his
lengthen
cheek
,
while
he
fix
upon
me
a
look
of
such
unutterable
woe
,
that
it
may
have
soften
a
far
hard
heart
than
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
infinitely
great
pain
to
cheer
him
up
again
than
I
have
take
to
depress
him
;
and
I
soon
understand
(
as
I
ought
to
have
know
at
first
)
that
he
have
be
so
confident
,
merely
because
of
his
faith
in
the
wise
and
most
wonderful
of
woman
,
and
his
unbounded
reliance
on
my
intellectual
resource
.
 
<EOS>
the
latter
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
he
consider
a
match
for
any
kind
of
disaster
not
absolutely
mortal
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
can
we
do
,
Trotwood
?
"
say
Mr
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
the
Memorial
---
"
   
"
to
be
sure
there
be
,
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
but
all
we
can
do
just
now
,
Mr
Dick
,
be
to
keep
a
cheerful
countenance
,
and
not
let
my
aunt
see
that
we
be
think
about
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
assent
to
this
in
the
most
earnest
manner
;
and
implore
me
,
if
I
should
see
him
wander
an
inch
out
of
the
right
course
,
to
recall
him
by
some
of
those
superior
method
which
be
always
at
my
command
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
regret
to
state
that
the
fright
I
have
give
him
prove
too
much
for
his
good
attempt
at
concealment
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
evening
his
eye
wander
to
my
aunt
's
face
,
with
an
expression
of
the
most
dismal
apprehension
,
as
if
he
see
her
grow
thin
on
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
conscious
of
this
,
and
put
a
constraint
upon
his
head
;
but
his
keeping
that
immovable
,
and
sit
roll
his
eye
like
a
piece
of
machinery
,
do
not
mend
the
matter
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
look
at
the
loaf
at
supper
(
which
happen
to
be
a
small
one
)
,
as
if
nothing
else
stand
between
us
and
famine
;
and
when
my
aunt
insist
on
his
make
his
customary
repast
,
I
detect
him
in
the
act
of
pocket
fragment
of
his
bread
and
cheese
;
I
have
no
doubt
for
the
purpose
of
revive
us
with
those
saving
,
when
we
should
have
reach
an
advanced
stage
of
attenuation
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
on
the
other
hand
,
be
in
a
compose
frame
of
mind
,
which
be
a
lesson
to
all
of
us
---
to
me
,
I
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
extremely
gracious
to
Peggotty
,
except
when
I
inadvertently
call
her
by
that
name
;
and
,
strange
as
I
know
she
feel
in
London
,
appear
quite
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
to
have
my
bed
,
and
I
be
to
lie
in
the
sitting
-
room
,
to
keep
guard
over
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
make
a
great
point
of
be
so
near
the
river
,
in
case
of
a
conflagration
;
and
I
suppose
really
do
find
some
satisfaction
in
that
circumstance
.
   
<EOS>
"
Trot
,
my
dear
,
"
say
my
aunt
,
when
she
see
me
make
preparation
for
compound
her
usual
night
-
draught
,
"
no

"
   
<EOS>
"

aunt
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
not

<EOS>
Ale

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
but
there

aunt
.
 
<EOS>
and
you
always
have
it
make
of

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
keep
that
,
in
case
of
sickness
,
"
say
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
not
use
it
carelessly
,
Trot
.
 
<EOS>
Ale
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
half
a
pint
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
think
Mr
Dick
would
have
fall
,
insensible
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
be
resolute
,
I
go
out
and
get
the
ale
myself
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
be
grow
late
,
Peggotty
and
Mr
Dick
take
that
opportunity
of
repair
to
the
chandler
's
shop
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
part
from
him
,
poor
fellow
,
at
the
corner
of
the
street
,
with
his
great
kite
at
his
back
,
a
very
monument
of
human
misery
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
be
walk
up
and
down
the
room
when
I
return
,
crimp
the
border
of
her
nightcap
with
her
finger
.
 
<EOS>
I
warm
the
ale
and
make
the
toast
on
the
usual
infallible
principle
.
 
<EOS>
when
it
be
ready
for
her
,
she
be
ready
for
it
,
with
her
nightcap
on
,
and
the
skirt
of
her
gown
turn
back
on
her
knee
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
say
my
aunt
,
after
take
a
spoonful
of
it
;
"
it
be
a
great
deal
well
than
wine
.
 
<EOS>
not
half
so
bilious
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
look
doubtful
,
for
she
add
:
   
<EOS>
"
tut
,
tut
,
child
.
 
<EOS>
if
nothing
bad
than
Ale
happen
to
us
,
we
be
well
off
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
so
myself
,
aunt
,
I
be
sure
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
why
don't
you
think
so
?
"
say
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
because
you
and
I
be
very
different
people
,
"
I
return
.
   
<EOS>
"
stuff
and
nonsense
,
Trot
!
"
reply
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
my
aunt
go
on
with
a
quiet
enjoyment
,
in
which
there
be
very
little
affectation
,
if
any
;
drink
the
warm
ale
with
a
tea
-
spoon
,
and
soak
her
strip
of
toast
in
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Trot
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
do
not
care
for
strange
face

general

I
rather
like
that
Barkis
of
yours

you
know

<EOS>
"
It
be
well
than
a
hundred
pound

I.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
most
extraordinary

observe
my
aunt

rub
her
nose
;
"
how
that
woman
ever
get
into
it
with
that
name

unaccountable

It

be
much
more
easy

be
bear
a
Jackson

something
of

one
would
think

"
   
<EOS>

so

too

I.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not

return
my
aunt
,
rather
grudge
the
admission

it
be
very
aggravating

however

she
be
Barkis

comfort

fond

I
do

expect

I
wonder
they
do
not
knock
out
their
brain
against
---
against
mantelpiece

my

an
idea
which
be
probably
suggest
to

by
her
contemplation

mine

"
Poor

My

I
seriously

never

my

for
a
single
moment

to
consider
whether
she
be

not

<EOS>
I
resent
the
idea

I
be
in
a
manner
strike
by
it

kind

She
ask
me
this
so
kindly

with
such
a
gentle
air

half
playful

half
sorrowful

that
I

quite
touch

We

without

I
feel

"
however

I

this
be
not
upon

very
comforting
to
a
rapturous
lover

glad
to

my

I
be
mindful

fatigue

ardently

take

how
miserable
I
be

down

how
I
think

about

about
my

necessity

tell
Dora
what

about

during

long

nothing

anything

about
come
down
to
have
no
money
in
my
pocket

and
to
wear
a
shabby
coat
,
and
to
be
able
to
carry
Dora
no
little
present
,
and
to
ride
no
gallant
grey
,
and
to
show
myself
in
no
agreeable
light
!
 
<EOS>
Sordid
and
selfish
as
I
know
it
be
,
and
as
I
torture
myself
by
know
that
it
be
,
to
let
my
mind
run
on
my
own
distress
so
much
,
I
be
so
devoted
to
Dora
that
I
could
not
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
it
be
base
in
me
not
to
think
more
of
my
aunt
,
and
less
of
myself
;
but
,
so
far
,
selfishness
be
inseparable
from
Dora
,
and
I
could
not
put
Dora
on
one
side
for
any
mortal
creature
.
 
<EOS>
how
exceedingly
miserable
I
be
,
that
night
!
   
<EOS>
as
to
sleep
,
I
have
dream
of
poverty
in
all
sort
of
shape
,
but
I
seem
to
dream
without
the
previous
ceremony
of
go
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
now
I
be
ragged
,
want
to
sell
Dora
match
,
six
bundle
for
a
halfpenny
;
now
I
be
at
the
office
in
a
nightgown
and
boot
,
remonstrate
with
by
Mr
Spenlow
on
appear
before
the
client
in
that
airy
attire
;
now
I
be
hungrily
pick
up
the
crumb
that
fall
from
old
Tiffey
's
daily
biscuit
,
regularly
eaten
when
St
Paul
's
strike
one
;
now
I
be
hopelessly
endeavouring
to
get
a
licence
to
marry
Dora
,
have
nothing
but
one
of
Uriah
Heep
's
glove
to
offer
in
exchange
,
which
the
whole
Commons
reject
;
and
still
,
more
or
less
conscious
of
my
own
room
,
I
be
always
toss
about
like
a
distressed
ship
in
a
sea
of
bed
-
clothe
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
be
restless
,
too
,
for
I
frequently
hear
her
walk
to
and
fro
.
 
<EOS>
two
or
,
three
time
in
the
course
of
the
night
,
attire
in
a
long
flannel
wrapper
in
which
she
look
seven
foot
high
,
she
appear
,
like
a
disturbed
ghost
,
in
my
room
,
and
come
to
the
side
of
the
sofa
on
which
I
lie
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
first
occasion
I
start
up
in
alarm
,
to
learn
that
she
infer
from
a
particular
light
in
the
sky
,
that
Westminster
Abbey
be
on
fire
;
and
to
be
consult
in
reference
to
the
probability
of
its
igniting
Buckingham
Street
,
in
case
the
wind
change
.
 
<EOS>
lie
still
,
after
that
,
I
find
that
she
sit
down
near
me
,
whisper
to
herself
"
poor
boy
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
it
make
me
twenty
time
more
wretched
,
to
know
how
unselfishly
mindful
she
be
of
me
,
and
how
selfishly
mindful
I
be
of
myself
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
difficult
to
believe
that
a
night
so
long
to
me
,
could
be
short
to
anybody
else
.
 
<EOS>
this
consideration
set
me
think
and
thinking
of
an
imaginary
party
where
people
be
dance
the
hour
away
,
until
that
become
a
dream
too
,
and
I
hear
the
music
incessantly
play
one
tune
,
and
see
Dora
incessantly
dance
one
dance
,
without
take
the
least
notice
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
who
have
be
play
the
harp
all
night
,
be
try
in
vain
to
cover
it
with
an
ordinary
-
sized
nightcap
,
when
I
awoke
;
or
I
should
rather
say
,
when
I
leave
off
try
to
go
to
sleep
,
and
see
the
sun
shine
in
through
the
window
at
last
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
an
old
roman
bath
in
those
day
at
the
bottom
of
one
of
the
street
out
of
the
Strand
---
it
may
be
there
still
---
in
which
I
have
have
many
a
cold
plunge
.
 
<EOS>
dress
myself
as
quietly
as
I
could
,
and
leave
Peggotty
to
look
after
my
aunt
,
I
tumble
head
foremost
into
it
,
and
then
go
for
a
walk
to
Hampstead
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
hope
that
this
brisk
treatment
may
freshen
my
wit
a
little
;
and
I
think
it
do
them
good
,
for
I
soon
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
first
step
I
ought
to
take
be
,
to
try
if
my
article
could
be
cancel
and
the
premium
recover
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
some
breakfast
on
the
Heath
,
and
walk
back
to
doctor

Commons
,
along
the
water
road
   
and
through
a
pleasant
smell
of
summer
flower
,
grow
in

and
carry
into
town
on
huckster
'
head
,
intent
on
this
first
effort
to
meet
our
alter
circumstance
.
   
<EOS>
I
arrive
at
the
office
so
soon
,
after
all
,
<EOS>
that
I
have
half
an
hour
's
loitering
about
the
Commons
,
before
old
Tiffey
,
who
be
always
first
,
appear
with
his
key
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
sit
down
in
my
shady
corner
,
look
up
at
the
sunlight
on
the
opposite
chimney

pot
,
and
think
about
Dora

on

touch
himself
up

hang
inside

<EOS>
"
I

put
in
this
,
on
the
spur
of
the
moment

warn

the
blank
expression

his

My

quietly

bear

I
have
no

complain

if
she
tire
me

sometimes

by
her
praise

her
son

it
be
only
natural
in

He
be
a

good

<EOS>
I
look
at
agne
when
she
say
these
word
,
without
detect
in
her
any
consciousness

design

mild

<EOS>
earnest
eye

mine

beautiful
frankness

there
be
no

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
chief
evil
of
their

"
be
that
I
can
not
be
as
near
papa

I
could
wish

be
so
much
between
us

bold
a

closely

I
would

any
fraud

practise
against

any
evil

misfortune

<EOS>
a
certain
bright
smile
,
which
I
never
see
on
any
other
face
,
die
away
,
even
while
I
think
how
good
it
be
,
and
how
familiar
it
have
once
be
to
me
;
and
she
ask
me
,
with
a
quick
change
of
expression
(
we
be
draw
very
near
my
street
)
,
if
I
know
how
the
reverse
in

circumstance

bring
about

on

replying
no

she
have
not
tell
me
yet
,
Agnes
become
thoughtful
,

I
fancy
I
feel
her
arm
tremble
in
mine
.
   
<EOS>
We
find
my
aunt
alone
,
in
a
state
of
some
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
a
difference
of
opinion
have
arise
between
herself
and
Mrs
Crupp
,
on
an
abstract
question
(
the
propriety
of
chamber
be
inhabit
by
the
gentler
sex
)
;
and
my
aunt
,
utterly
indifferent
to
spasm
on
the
part
of
Mrs
Crupp
,
have
cut
the
dispute
short
,
by
inform
that
lady
that
she
smell
of
my
brandy
,
and
that
she
would
trouble
her
to
walk
out
.
 
<EOS>
both
of
these
expression
Mrs
Crupp
consider
actionable
,
and
have
express
her
intention
of
bring
before
a
"
British
Judy
"

<EOS>
meaning
,
it
be
suppose
,
the
bulwark
of
our
national
liberty
.
   
<EOS>
my
aunt
,
however
,
have
have
time
to
cool
,
while
Peggotty
be
out
show
Mr
Dick
the
soldier
at
the
Horse
Guards
---
and
be
,
besides
,
greatly
pleased
to
see
Agnes
<EOS>
---
rather
plume
herself
on
the
affair
than
otherwise
,
and
receive
us
with
unimpaired
good
humour
.
 
<EOS>
when
Agnes
lay
her
bonnet
on
the
table
,
and
sit
down
beside
her
,
I
could
not
but
think
,
look
on
her
mild
eye
and
her
radiant
forehead
,
how
natural
it
seem
to
have
her
there
;
how
trustfully
,
although
she
be
so
young
and
inexperienced
,
my
aunt
confide
in
her
;
how
strong
she
be
,
indeed
,
in
simple
love
and
truth
.
   
<EOS>
We
begin
to
talk
about
my
aunt
's
loss
,
and
I
tell
them
what
I
have
try
to
do
that
morning
.
   
<EOS>
"
which
be
injudicious
,
Trot

my

"

well
mean

<EOS>
You
be
a
generous
boy

young
man

now

<EOS>
I
be
proud
of
you

my

so
far
,
so
good

<EOS>
now
,
Trot
and
Agnes

let
us
look
the
case
of
Betsey
Trotwood
in
the
face
,

see
how
it
stand
.

<EOS>

pale

very
attentively
at

pat
her
cat

look
very
attentively
at
Agnes

<EOS>
"
Betsey
Trotwood

"

my
aunt
,
who
have
always
keep
her
money
matter
to
herself

<EOS>
"
---
I
do
not
mean
your
sister
,
Trot
,
my
dear
,
but
myself
---
have
a
certain
property
.
 
<EOS>
It
do
not
matter
how
much
;
enough
to
live
on
.
 
<EOS>
More
;
for
she
have
save
a
little
,
and
add
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
Betsey
fund
her
property
for
some
time
,
and
then
,
by
the
advice
of
her
man
of
business
,
lay
it
out
on
landed
security
.
<EOS>
that
do
very
well
,
and
return
very
good
interest
,
till
Betsey
be
pay
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
talk
of
Betsey
as
if
she
be
a
man
-
of
-
war
.
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
then
,
Betsey
have
to
look
about
her
,
for
a
new
investment
.
<EOS>
She
think
she
be
wise
,
now
,
than
her
man
of
business
,
who
be
not
such
a
good
man
of
business
by
this
time
,
as
he
use
to
be
---
I
be
allude
to
your
father
,
Agnes
---
and
she
take
it
into
her
head
to
lay
it
out
for
herself
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
take
her
pig
,
"
say
my
aunt
,
"
to
a
foreign
market
;
and
a
very
bad
market
it
turn
out
to
be
.
<EOS>
first
,
she
lose
in
the
mining
way
,
and
then
she
lose
in
the
diving
way
---
fish
up
treasure
,
or
some
such
Tom
Tiddler
nonsense
,
"
explain
my
aunt
,
rub
her
nose
;
"
and
then
she
lose
in
the
mining
way
again
,
and
,
last
of
all
,
to
set
the
thing
entirely
to
right
,
she
lose
in
the
banking
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
the
Bank
share
be
worth
for
a
little
while
,
"
say
my
aunt
;
"
cent
per
cent
be
the
low
of
it
,
I
believe
;
but
the
Bank
be
at
the
other
end
of
the
world
,
and
tumble
into
space
,
for
what
I
know
;
anyhow
,
it
fall
to
piece
,
and
never
will
and
never
can
pay
sixpence
;
and
Betsey
's
sixpence
be
all
there
,
and
there
be
an
end
of
them
.
<EOS>
Least
say
,
soon
mend
!
"
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
conclude
this
philosophical
summary
,
by
fix
her
eye
with
a
kind
of
triumph
on
Agnes
,
whose
colour
be
gradually
return

<EOS>
"
Dear
Miss
Trotwood

all

"
if
there
have
be
more
money
to
lose

it

I
dare
say

Betsey
would
have
contrive
to
throw
that
after
the
rest

make
another
chapter
,
I
have
little
doubt

there

there

agne
have
listen
at

breath

<EOS>
Her

still
come

she
breathe
more
freely

<EOS>
I
think
I
know
why
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
she
have
have
some
fear
that
her
unhappy
father
may
be
in
some
way
to
blame
for
what
have
happen

My

take
her

in
hers

be
that

repeat
my

yes

live
happy

perhaps
I
may
add
that
of

of

here
my

an
energy
peculiar

what
be

here

my

with

it
be
an
idiosyncrasy

it
be
with
some
horse

to
stop
very
short

she
appear

We

<EOS>
I
be
about
to
explain
that
I
be
not
desirous
of
introduce
that
mode
of
provision
into
the
family
,
when
agne
inquire
if
my
room

any
long
term

<EOS>
"
You

the
point

They

five

I
have
a

ready
money

I
agree
with
you

the
good
thing
we
can
do

be
,
to
live
the
term
out
here

and
get
a
bedroom
hard
by

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
think
it
my
duty
to
hint
at
the
discomfort
my
aunt
would
sustain
,
from
live
in
a
continual
state
of
guerilla
warfare
with
Mrs
Crupp
;
but
she
dispose
of
that
objection
summarily
by
declare
that

on
the
first
demonstration
of
hostility
,
she
be
prepared
to
astonish
Mrs
Crupp
for
the
whole
remainder
of
her
natural
life

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
agne
answer
with
her
pleasant
laugh
,
that
one
good
Angel
(
mean
Dora

be
enough
;
and
go
on
to
remind
me
that
the
Doctor
have
be
use
to
occupy
himself
in
his
study
,
early
in
the
morning
,
and
in
the
evening
---
and
that
probably
my
leisure
would
suit
his
requirement
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
scarcely
more
delighted
with
the
prospect
of
earn
my
own
bread
,
than
with
the
hope
of
earn
it
under
my
old
master
;
in
short
,
act
on
the
advice
of
Agnes
,
I
sit
down
and
write
a
letter
to
the
Doctor
,
state
my
object
,
and
appoint
to
call
on
him
next
day
at
ten
in
the
forenoon
.
 
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
I
address
to
Highgate
---
for
in
that
place
,
so
memorable
to
me
,
he
live
---
and
go
and
post
,
myself
,
without
lose
a
minute
.
   
<EOS>
wherever
Agnes
be
,
some
agreeable
token
of
her
noiseless
presence
<EOS>
seem
inseparable
from
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
come
back
,
I
find
my
aunt
's
bird
hang
,
just
as
they
have
hang
so
long
in
the
parlour
window
of
the
cottage
;
and
my
easy
-
chair
imitate
my
aunt
's
much
easy
chair
in
its
position
at
the
open
window
;
and
even
the
round
green
fan
,
which
my
aunt
have
bring
away
with
her
,
screw
on
to
the
window
-
sill
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
who
have
do
all
this
,
by
its
seeming
to
have
quietly
do
itself
;
and
I
should
have
know
in
a
moment
who
have
arrange
my
neglect
book
in
the
old
order
of
my
school
day
,
even
if
I
have
suppose
Agnes
to
be
mile
away
,
instead
of
see
her
busy
with
them
,
and
smile
at
the
disorder
into
which
they
have
fall
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
be
quite
gracious
on
the
subject
of
the
Thames
<EOS>
(
it
really
do
look
very
well
with
the
sun
upon
it
,
though
not
like
the
sea
before
the
cottage
)
,
but
she
could
not
relent
towards
the
London
smoke
,
which
,
she
say
,
"
pepper
everything
"
.
 
<EOS>
a
complete
revolution
,
in
which
Peggotty
bear
a
prominent
part
,
be
be
effect
in
every
corner
of
my
room
,
in
regard
of
this
pepper
;
and
I
be
look
on
,
think
how
little
even
Peggotty
seem
to
do
with
a
good
deal
of
bustle
,
and
how
much
Agnes
do
without
any
bustle
at
all
,
when
a
knock
come
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
say
Agnes
,
turn
pale
,
"
it
be
papa
.
 
<EOS>
He
promise
me
that
he
would
come
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
open
the
door
,
and
admit
,
not
only
Mr
Wickfield
,
but
Uriah
Heep
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
Mr
Wickfield
for
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
prepare
for
a
great
change
in
him
,
after
what
I
have
hear
from
Agnes
,
but
his
appearance
shock
me
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
he
look
many
year
old
,
though
still
dress
with
the
old
scrupulous
cleanliness
;
or
that
there
be
an
unwholesome
ruddiness
upon
his
face
;
or
that
his
eye
be
full
and
bloodshot
;
or
that
there
be
a
nervous
tremble
in
his
hand
,
the
cause
of
which
I
know
,
and
have
for
some
year
see
at
work
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
he
have
lose
his
good
look
,
or
his
old
bearing
of
a
gentleman
---
for
that
he
have
not
---
but
the
thing
that
strike
me
most
,
be
,
that
with
the
evidence
of
his
native
superiority
still
upon
him
,
he
should
submit
himself
to
that
crawl
impersonation
of
meanness
,
Uriah
Heep
.
 
<EOS>
the
reversal
of
the
two
nature
,
in
their
relative
position
,
Uriah
's
of
power
and
Mr
Wickfield
's
of
dependence
,
be
a
sight
more
painful
to
me
than
I
can
express
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
see
an
Ape
take
command
of
a
man
,
I
should
hardly
have
think
it
a
more
degrading
spectacle
.
   
<EOS>
He
appear
to
be
only
too
conscious
of
it
himself
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
come
in
,
he
stand
still
;
and
with
his
head
bow
,
as
if
he
feel
it
.
<EOS>
this
be
only
for
a
moment
;
for
Agnes
softly
say
to
him
,
"
Papa
!
<EOS>
here
be
Miss
Trotwood
---
and
Trotwood
,
whom
you
have
not
see
for
a
long
while
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
he
approach
,
and
constrainedly
give
my
aunt
his
hand
,
and
shake
hand
more
cordially
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
moment
's
pause
I
speak
of
<EOS>
,
I
see
Uriah
's
countenance
form
itself
into
a
most
ill
-
favour
smile
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
see
it
too
,
I
think
,
for
she
shrink
from
him
.
   
<EOS>
what
my
aunt
see
,
or
do
not
see
,
I
defy
the
science
of
physiognomy
to
have
make
out
,
without
her
own
consent
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
there
never
be
anybody
with
such
an
imperturbable
countenance
when
she
choose
.
<EOS>
Her
face
may
have
be
a
dead
-
wall
on
the
occasion
in
question
,
for
any
light
it
throw
upon
her
thought
;
until
she
break
silence
with
her
usual
abruptness
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
Wickfield
!
"
say
my
aunt
;
and
he
look
up
at
her
for
the
first
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
tell
your
daughter
how
well
I

dispose
of
my
money
for

not
trust
it

you

you

rusty

<EOS>
We
have

counsel
together

get
on
very
well

all

Agnes

worth
the
whole
firm

in
my
opinion

<EOS>
"
if
I
may
umbly
make
the
remark
,
"
say
Uriah
Heep
,
with
a
writhe
,
"
I
fully
agree
with
Miss
Betsey
Trotwood
,
and
should
be
only
too
appy

in
acknowledgement
of
this
question
,
address
to
him
with
extraordinary
curtness
,
Mr
Heep
,
uncomfortably
clutch
the
blue
bag
he
carry

reply
that

pretty
well

<EOS>
here
he
shake
hand
with
me
:
not
in
the
common
way
,
but
stand
at
a
good
distance
from
me
,
and
lift
my
hand
up
and
down
like
a
pump
handle

that

be
a
little
afraid
of

Mr

be
rather
abash

as
most
people
may
have
be

by
this
explosion

which
derive
great
additional
force
from
the
indignant

my

afterwards
move
in
her

shake
her
head

bounce

to

aside

I
wish
you
good

Master
Copperfield

my
umble
respect

"
   
<EOS>
with
those
word
,
he
retire
,
kiss
his
great
hand
,
and
leer
at
us
like
a
mask
.
   
<EOS>
We
sit
there
,
talk
about
our
pleasant
old
Canterbury
day
,
an
hour
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Wickfield
,
leave
to
Agnes
,
soon
become
more
like
his
former
self
;
though
there
be
a
settle
depression
upon
him
,
which
he
never
shake
off
.
 
<EOS>
for
all
that
,
he
brighten
;
and
have
an
evident
pleasure
in
hear
us
recall
the
little
incident
of
our
old
life
<EOS>
,
many
of
which
he
remember
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
it
be
like
those
time
,
to
be
alone
with
Agnes
and
me
again
;
and
he
wish
to
Heaven
they
have
never
change
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
there
be
an
influence
in
the
placid
face
of
Agnes
,
and
in
the
very
touch
of
her
hand
upon
his
arm
,
that
do
wonder
for
him
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
(
who
be
busy
nearly
all
this
while
with
Peggotty
,
in
the
inner
room
)
would
not
accompany
us
to
the
place
where
they
be
stay
,
but
insist
on
my
going
;
and
I
go
.
 
<EOS>
We
dine
together
.
<EOS>
after
dinner
,
Agnes
sit
beside
him
,
as
of
old
,
and
pour
out
his
wine
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
what
she
give
him
,
and
no
more
---
like
a
child
---
<EOS>
and
we
all
three
sit
together
at
a
window
as
the
evening
gather
in
.
<EOS>
when
it
be
almost
dark
,
he
lie
down
on
a
sofa
,
agne
pillow
his
head
and
bend
over
him
a
little
while
;
and
when
she
come
back
to
the
window
,
it
be
not
so
dark
<EOS>
but
I
could
see
tear
glitter
in
her
eye
.
   
<EOS>
I
pray
Heaven
that
I
never
may
forget
the
dear
girl
in
her
love
and
truth
,
at
that
time
of
my
life
;
for
if
I
should
,
I
must
be
draw
near
the
end
,
and
then
I
would
desire
to
remember
her
good
!
 
<EOS>
She
fill
my
heart
with
such
good
resolution
,
strengthen
my
weakness
so
,
by
her
example
,
so
directed
---
I
know
not
how
,
she
be
too
modest
and
gentle
to
advise
me
in
many
word
---
the
wander
ardour
and
unsettled
purpose
within
me
,
that
all
the
little
good
I
have
do
,
and
all
the
harm
I
have
forborne
,
I
solemnly
believe
I
may
refer
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
and
how
she
speak
to
me
of
Dora
,
sit
at
the
window
in
the
dark
;
listen
to
my
praise
of
her
;
praise
again
;
and
round
the
little
fairy
-
figure
shed
some
glimpse
of
her
own
pure
light
,
that
make
it
yet
more
precious
and
more
innocent
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
oh
,
Agnes
,
sister
of
my
boyhood
,
<EOS>
if
I
have
know
then
,
what
I
know
long
afterwards
!
<EOS>
---
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
beggar
in
the
street
,
when
I
go
down
;
and
as
I
turn
my
head
towards
the
window
,
think
of
her
calm
seraphic
eye
,
he
make
me
start
by
muttering
,
as
if
he
be
an
echo
of
the
morning

<EOS>
enthusiasm
 
<EOS>
I
begin
the
next
day
with
another
dive
into
the
roman
bath
,
and
then
start
for
Highgate
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
dispirit
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
afraid
of
the
shabby
coat
,
and
have
no
yearning
after
gallant
grey
.
 
<EOS>
My
whole
manner
of
thinking
of
our
late
misfortune
be
change
.
 
<EOS>
what
I
have
to
do
,
be
,
to
show
my
aunt
that
her
past
goodness
to
me
have
not
be
throw
away
on
an
insensible
,
ungrateful
object
.
 
<EOS>
what
I
have
to
do
,
be
,
to
turn
the
painful
discipline
of
my
young
day
to
account
,
by
go
to
work
with
a
resolute
and
steady
heart
.
 
<EOS>
what
I
have
to
do
,
be
,
to
take
my
woodman
's
axe
in
my
hand
,
and
clear
my
own
way
through
the
forest
of
difficulty
,
by
cut
down
the
tree
until
I
come
to
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
go
on
at
a
mighty
rate
,
as
if
it
could
be
do
by
walk
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
find
myself
on
the
familiar
Highgate
road
,
pursue
such
a
different
errand
from
that
old
one
of
pleasure
,
with
which
it
be
associate
,
it
seem
as
if
a
complete
change
have
come
on
my
whole
life
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
do
not
discourage
me
.
 
<EOS>
with
the
new
life
,
come
new
purpose
,
new
intention
.
 
<EOS>
Great
be
the
labour
;
priceless
the
reward
.
 
<EOS>
Dora
be
the
reward
,
and
Dora
must
be
win
.
   
<EOS>
I
get
into
such
a
transport
,
that
I
feel
quite
sorry
<EOS>
my
coat
be
not
a
little
shabby
already
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
be
cut
at
those
tree
in
the
forest
of
difficulty
,
under
circumstance
that
should
prove
my
strength
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
good
mind
to
ask
an
old
man
,
in
wire
spectacle
,
who
be
break
stone
upon
the
road
,
to
lend
me
his
hammer
for
a
little
while
,
and
let
me
begin
to
beat
a
path
to
Dora
out
of
granite
.
 
<EOS>
I
stimulate
myself
into
such
a
heat
,
and
get
so
out
of
breath
,
that
I
feel
as
if
I
have
be
earn
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
much
.
   
<EOS>
in
this
state
,
I
go
into
a
cottage
that
I
see
be
to
let
,
and
examine
it
narrowly
,
---
for
I
feel
it
necessary
to
be
practical
.
<EOS>
It
would
do
for
me
and
Dora
admirably
:
with
a
little
front
garden
for
Jip
to
run
about
in
,
and
bark
at
the
tradespeople
through
the
railing
,
and
a
capital
room
upstairs
for
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
out
again
,
hot
and
faster
than
ever
,
and
dash
up
to
Highgate
,
at
such
a
rate
that
I
be
there
an
hour
too
early
;
and
,
though
I
have
not
be
,
should
have
be
oblige
to
stroll
about
to
cool
myself
,
before
I
be
at
all
presentable
.
   
<EOS>
My
first
care
,
after
put
myself
under
this
necessary
course
of
preparation
,
be
to
find
the
doctor
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
in
that
part
of
Highgate
where
Mrs
Steerforth
live
,
but
quite
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
little
town
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
make
this
discovery
,
I
go
back
,
in
an
attraction
I
could
not
resist
,
to
a
lane
by
Mrs
Steerforth
's
,
and
look
over
the
corner
of
the
garden
wall
.
 
<EOS>
His
room
be
shut
up
close
.
 
<EOS>
the
conservatory
door
be
stand
open
,
and
Rosa
Dartle
be
walk
,
bareheade
,
with
a
quick
,
impetuous
step
,
up
and
down
a
gravel
walk
on
one
side
of
the
lawn
.
 
<EOS>
She
give
me
the
idea
of
some
fierce
thing
<EOS>
,
that
be
drag
the
length
of
its
chain
to
and
fro
upon
a
beat
track
,
and
wear
its
heart
out
.
   
<EOS>
I
come
softly
away
from
my
place
of
observation
,
and
avoid
that
part
of
the
neighbourhood
,
and
wish
I
have
not
go
near
it
,
stroll
about
until
it
be
ten
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
the
church
with
the
slender
spire
,
that
stand
on
the
top
of
the
hill
now
,
be
not
there
then
to
tell
me
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
an
old
red
-
brick
mansion
,
use
as
a
school
,
be
in
its
place
;
and
a
fine
old
house
it
must
have
be
to
go
to
school
at
,
as
I
recollect
it
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
approach
the
Doctor
's
cottage
---
a
pretty
old
place
,
on
which
he
seem
to
have
expend
some
money
,
if
I
may
judge
from
the
embellishment
and
repair
that
have
the
look
of
be
just
complete
---
I
see
him
walk
in
the
garden
at
the
side
,
gaiter
and
all
,
as
if
he
have
never
leave
off
walk
since
the
day
of
my
pupilage
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
his
old
companion
about
him
,
too
;
for
there
be
plenty
of
high
tree
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
two
or
three
rook
be
on
the
grass
,
look
after
him
,
as
if
they
have
be
write
to
about
him
by
the
Canterbury
rook
,
and
be
observe
him
closely
in
consequence
.
   
<EOS>
know
the
utter
hopelessness
of
attract
his
attention
from
that
distance
,
I
make
bold
to
open
the
gate
,
and
walk
after
him
,
so
as
to
meet
him
when
he
should
turn
round
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
do
,
and
come
towards
me
,
he
look
at
me
thoughtfully
for
a
few
moment
,
evidently
without
think
about
me
at
all
;
and
then
his
benevolent
face
express
extraordinary
pleasure
,
and
he
take
me
by
both
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
"
say
the
Doctor
,
"
you
be
a
man
!
 
<EOS>
how
do
you
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
delighted
to

so

last

I
show

you

<EOS>

<EOS>

<EOS>
He

pretty
well

too

I
inquire

<EOS>
from

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes

Mr

Maldon
could
not
bear
the

my

Mrs
Markleham

you
have
not
forget
Mrs
Markleham

<EOS>
forget
the
Old
Soldier

<EOS>
and
in
that
short
time
!
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Markleham
,
"
say
the
Doctor
,
"
be
quite
vexed
about
him
,
poor
thing
;
so
we
have
get
him
at
home
again
;
and
we
have
buy
him
a
little
Patent
place
,
which
agree
with
him
much
better
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
enough
of
Mr
Jack
Maldon
to
suspect
from
this
account
that
it
be
a
place
where
there
be
not
much
to
do
,
and
which
be
pretty
well
pay
.
 
<EOS>
the
Doctor
,
walk
up
and
down
with
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
,
and
his
kind
face
turn
encouragingly
to
mine
,
go
on
:
   
"
<EOS>
now
,
my
dear
Copperfield

in
reference
to
this
proposal
of
yours

<EOS>
It
be
very
gratifying

agreeable
to
me

I
be
sure
;
but
do
not
you
think
you
could
do
better
?
 
<EOS>
You
achieve
distinction
,
you
know

when
you
be
with
us

<EOS>
You
be
qualified

many
good

You
have
lay
a
foundation

upon

and
be
it
not
a

that
you
should
devote
the
spring

your

such
a

pursuit

I
can
offer

"
   
<EOS>
I
become
very
glowing
again
,
and
,
express
myself
in
a
rhapsodical
style
<EOS>
,
I
be
afraid
,
urge
my
request
strongly
;
remind
the
Doctor
that
I
have
already
a
profession

"
well

well

certainly

the

not
that
I
mean

up

keep
his
hand
there
,
as
we
still
walk
up
and
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
shall
be
twenty
time
happy
,
sir
,
"
say
I
,
with
a
little
---
I
hope
innocent
---
flattery
,
"
if
my
employment
be
to
be
on
the
Dictionary
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
Doctor
stop
,
smilingly
clap
me
on
the
shoulder
again
,
and
exclaim
,
with
a
triumph
most
delightful
to
behold
,
as
if
I
have
penetrate
to
the
profound
depth
of
mortal
sagacity
,
"
My
dear
young
friend
,
you
have
hit
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
Dictionary
!
"
   
<EOS>
how
could
it
be
anything
else
!
 
<EOS>
His
pocket
be
as
full
of
it
as
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
stick
out
of
him
in
all
direction
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
that
since
his
retirement
from
scholastic
life
,
he
have
be
advance
with
it
wonderfully
;
and
that
nothing
could
suit
him
better
than
the
propose
arrangement
for
morning
and
evening
work
,
as
it
be
his
custom
to
walk
about
in
the
daytime
with
his
consider
cap
on
.
 
<EOS>
His
paper
be
in
a
little
confusion
,
in
consequence
of
Mr
Jack
Maldon
have
lately
proffer
his
occasional
service
as
an
amanuensis
,
and
not
be
accustom
to
that
occupation
;
but
we
should
soon
put
right
<EOS>
what
be
amiss
,
and
go
on
swimmingly
.
 
<EOS>
afterwards
,
when
we
be
fairly
at
our
work
,
I
find
Mr
Jack
Maldon
's
effort
more
troublesome
to
me
than
I
have
expect
,
as
he
have
not
confine
himself
to
make
numerous
mistake
,
but
have
sketch
so
many
soldier
,
and
lady
'
head
,
over
the
Doctor
's
manuscript
,
that
I
often
become
involved
in
labyrinth
of
obscurity
.
   
<EOS>
the
Doctor
be
quite
happy
in
the
prospect
of
our
go
to
work
together
on
that
wonderful
performance
,
and
we
settle
to
begin
next
morning
at
seven
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
to
work
two
hour
every
morning
,
and
two
or
three
hour
every
night
,
except
on
Saturdays
,
when
I
be
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
on
Sundays
,
of
course
,
I
be
to
rest
also
,
and
I
consider
these
very
easy
term
.
   
<EOS>
Our
plan
be
thus
arrange
to
our
mutual
satisfaction
,
the
Doctor
take
me
into
the
house
to
present
me
to
Mrs
Strong
,
whom
we
find
in
the
Doctor
's
new
study
,
dust
his
book
,
---
a
freedom
which
he
never
permit
anybody
else
to
take
with
those
sacred
favourite
.
   
<EOS>
They
have
postpone
their
breakfast
on
my
account
,
and
we
sit
down
to
table
together
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
not
be
seat
long
,
when
I
see
an
approach
arrival
in
Mrs
Strong
's
face
,
before
I
hear
any
sound
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
a
gentleman
on
horseback
come
to
the
gate
,
and
lead
his
horse
into
the
little
court
,
with
the
bridle
over
his
arm
,
as
if
he
be
quite
at
home
,
tie
him
to
a
ring
in
the
empty
coach
-
house
wall
,
and
come
into
the
breakfast
parlour
,
whip
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Mr
Jack
Maldon
;
and
Mr
Jack
Maldon
be
not
at
all
improve
by
India
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
in
a
state
of
ferocious
virtue
,
however
,
as
to
young
man
who
be
not
cut
down
tree
in
the
forest
of
difficulty
;
and
my
impression
must
be
receive
with
due
allowance
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Jack
!
"
say
the
Doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Copperfield
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jack
Maldon
shake
hand
with
me
;
but
not
very
warmly
,
I
believe
;
and
with
an
air
of
languid
patronage
,
at
which
I
secretly
take
great
umbrage
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
languor
altogether
be
quite
a
wonderful
sight
;
except
when
he
address
himself
to
his
cousin
Annie
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
you
breakfast
this
morning
,
Mr
Jack
?
"
say
the
Doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
ever
take
breakfast
,
sir
,
"
he
reply
,
with
his
head
throw
back
in
an
easy
-
chair
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
find
it
bore
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
be
there
any
news
today
?
"
inquire
the
Doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
nothing
at
all
,
sir
,
"
reply
Mr
Maldon
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
an
account
about
the
people
be
hungry
and
discontent
down
in
the
North
,
but
they
be
always
be
hungry
and
discontent
somewhere
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
Doctor
look
grave
,
and
say
,
as
though
he
wish
to
change
the
subject
,
"
then
there
be
no
news
at
all
;
and
no
news
,
they
say
,
be
good
news
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
long
statement
in
the
paper
,
sir
,
about
a
murder
,
"
observe
Mr
Maldon
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
somebody
be
always
be
murder
,
and
I
do
not
read
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
a
display
of
indifference
to
all
the
action
and
passion
of
mankind
be
not
suppose
to
be
such
a
distinguished
quality
at
that
time
,
I
think
,
as
I
have
observe
it
to
be
consider
since
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
know
it
very
fashionable
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
it
display
with
such
success
,
that
I
have
encounter
some
fine
lady
and
gentleman
who
may
as
well
have
be
bear
caterpillar
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
it
impress
me
the
more
then
,
because
it
be
new
to
me
,
but
it
certainly
do
not
tend
to
exalt
my
opinion
of
,
or
to
strengthen
my
confidence
in
,
Mr
Jack
Maldon
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
come
out
to
inquire
whether
Annie
would
like
to
go
to
the
opera
tonight
,
"
say
Mr
Maldon
,
turn
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
last
good
night
<EOS>
there
will
be
,
this
season
;
and
there
be
a
singer
there
,
whom
she
really
ought
to
hear
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
perfectly
exquisite
.
 
<EOS>
besides
which
,
she
be
so
charmingly
ugly
,
"
relapse
into
languor
.
   
<EOS>
the
Doctor
,
ever
pleased
with
what
be
likely
to
please
his
young
wife
,
turn
to
her
and
say
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
go
,
Annie
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
go
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
not
,
"
she
say
to
the
Doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
prefer
to
remain
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
much
rather
remain
at
home
.
"
   
<EOS>
without
look
at
her
cousin
,
she
then
address
me
,
and
ask
me
about
Agnes
,
and
whether
she
should
see
her
,
and
whether
she
be
not
likely
to
come
that
day
;
and
be
so
much
disturb
,
that
I
wonder
how
even
the
Doctor
,
butter
his
toast
,
could
be
blind
to
what
be
so
obvious
.
   
<EOS>
but
he
see
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
her
,
good
-
naturedly
,
that
she
be
young
and
ought
to
be
amuse
and
entertain
,
and
must
not
allow
herself
to
be
make
dull
by
a
dull
old
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
moreover
,
he
say
,
he
want
to
hear
her
sing
all
the
new
singer
's
song
to
him
;
and
how
could
she
do
that
well
,
unless
she
go
?
 
<EOS>
so
the
Doctor
persist
in
make
the
engagement
for
her
,
and
Mr
Jack
Maldon
be
to
come
back
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
this
conclude
,
he
go
to
his
Patent
place
,
I
suppose
;
<EOS>
but
at
all
event
go
away
on
his
horse
,
look
very
idle
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
curious
to
find
out
next
morning
,
whether
she
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
not
,
but
have
send
into
London
to
put
her
cousin
off
;
and
have
go
out
in
the
afternoon
to
see
Agnes
,
and
have
prevail
upon
the
Doctor
to
go
with
her
;
and
they
have
walk
home
by
the
field
,
the
Doctor
tell
me
,
the
evening
be
delightful
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
then
,
whether
she
would
have
go
if
agne
have
not
be
in
town
,
and
whether
Agnes
have
some
good
influence
over
her
too
!
   
<EOS>
She
do
not
look
very
happy
,
I
think
;
but
it
be
a
good
face
,
or
a
very
false
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
often
glance
at
it
,
for
she
sit
in
the
window
all
the
time
we
be
at
work
;
and
make
our
breakfast
,
which
we
take
by
snatch
as
we
be
employ
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
leave
,
at
nine
o'clock
,
she
be
kneel
on
the
ground
at
the
Doctor
's
foot
,
put
on
his
shoe
and
gaiter
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
softened
shade
upon
her
face
,
throw
from
some
green
leave
overhang
the
open
window
of
the
low
room
;
and
I
think
all
the
way
to
doctor
'
Commons
,
of
the
night
when
I
have
see
it
look
at
him
as
he
read
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
pretty
busy
now
;
up
at
five
in
the
morning
,
and
home
at
nine
or
ten
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
infinite
satisfaction
in
be
so
closely
engaged
,
and
never
walk
slowly
on
any
account
,
and
feel
enthusiastically
that
the
more
I
tire
myself
,
the
more
I
be
do
to
deserve
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
reveal
myself
in
my
alter
character
to
Dora
yet
,
because
she
be
come
to
see
Miss
Mills
in
a
few
day
,
and
I
defer
all
I
have
to
tell
her
until
then
;
merely
inform
her
in
my
letter
(
all
our
communication
be
secretly
forward
through
Miss
Mills
)
,
that
I
have
much
to
tell
her
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
I
put
myself
on
a
short
allowance
of
bear
's
grease
,
wholly
abandon
scent
soap
and
lavender
water
,
and
sell
off
three
waistcoat
at
a
prodigious
sacrifice
,
as
be
too
luxurious
for
my
stern
career
.
   
<EOS>
not
satisfied
with
all
these
proceeding
,
but
burn
with
impatience
to
do
something
more
,
I
go
to
see
Traddles
,
now
lodge
up
behind
the
parapet
of
a
house
in
Castle
Street
,
Holborn
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
,
who
have
be
with
me
to
Highgate
twice
already
,
and
have
resume
his
companionship
with
the
Doctor
,
I
take
with
me
.
   
<EOS>
I
take
Mr
Dick
with
me
,
because
,
acutely
sensitive
to
my
aunt
's
reverse
,
and
sincerely
believe
that
no
galley
-
slave
or
convict
work
as
I
do
,
he
have
begin
to
fret
and
worry
himself
out
of
spirit
and
appetite
,
as
have
nothing
useful
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
condition
,
he
feel
more
incapable
of
finish
the
Memorial
than
ever
;
and
the
harder
he
work
at
it
,
the
oftener
that
unlucky
head
of
King
Charles
<EOS>
the
First
get
into
it
.
 
<EOS>
seriously
apprehend
that
his
malady
would
increase
,
unless
we
put
some
innocent
deception
upon
him
and
cause
him
to
believe
that
he
be
useful
,
or
unless
we
could
put
him
in
the
way
of
be
really
useful
(
which
would
be
better
)
,
I
make
up
my
mind
to
try
if
Traddles
could
help
us
.
<EOS>
before
we
go
,
I
write
Traddles
a
full
statement
of
all
that
have
happen
,
and
Traddles
write
me
back
a
capital
answer
,
expressive
of
his
sympathy
and
friendship
.
   
<EOS>
We
find
him
hard
at
work
with
his
inkstand
and
paper
,
refresh
by
the
sight
of
the
flower
-
pot
stand
and
the
little
round
table
in
a
corner
of
the
small
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
He
receive
us
cordially
,
and
make
friend
with
Mr
Dick
in
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
profess
an
absolute
certainty
of
have
see
him
before
,
and
we
both
say
,
"
very
likely
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
first
subject
on
which
I
have
to
consult
Traddles
be
this
<EOS>
,
---
I
have
hear
that
many
man
distinguish
in
various
pursuit
have
begin
life
by
report
the
debate
in
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
have
mention
newspaper
to
me
,
as
one
of
his
hope
,
I
have
put
the
two
thing
together
,
and
tell
Traddles
in
my
letter
that
I
wish
to
know
how
I
could
qualify
myself
for
this
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
now
inform
me
,
as
the
result
of
his
inquiry
,
that
the
mere
mechanical
acquisition
necessary
,
except
in
rare
case
,
for
thorough
excellence
in
it
,
that
be
to
say
,
a
perfect
and
entire
command
of
the
mystery
of
short
-
hand
writing
and
reading
,
be
about
equal
in
difficulty
to
the
mastery
of
six
language
;
and
that
it
may
perhaps
be
attain
,
by
dint
of
perseverance
,
in
the
course
of
a
few
year
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
reasonably
suppose
that
this
would
settle
the
business
;
but
I
,
only
feel
that
here
indeed
be
a
few
tall
tree
to
be
hew
down
,
immediately
resolve
to
work
my
way
on
to
Dora
through
this
thicket
,
axe
in
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
much
oblige
to
you
,
my
dear
traddle
!
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
begin
tomorrow
.
"
   
<EOS>
Traddles
look
astonished
,
as
he
well
may
;
but
he
have
no
notion
as
yet
of
my
rapturous
condition
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
buy
a
book
,
"
say
I
,
"
with
a
good
scheme
of
this
art
in
it
;
I
will
work
at
it
at
the
Commons
,
where
I
have
not
half
enough
to
do
;
I
will
take
down
the
speech
in
our
court
for
practice
---
<EOS>
Traddles
,
my
dear
fellow
,
I
will
master
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
dear
me
,
"
say
Traddles
,
open
his
eye
,
"
I
have
no
idea
you
be
such
a
determined
character
,
Copperfield
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
he
should
have
have
,
for
it
be
new
enough
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
pass
that
off
,
and
bring
Mr
Dick
on
the
carpet
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
say
Mr
Dick
,
wistfully
,
"
if
I
could
exert
myself
,
<EOS>
Mr
Traddles
---
if
I
could
beat
a
drum
---
or
blow
anything
!
"
   
<EOS>
poor
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
little
doubt
he
would
have
prefer
such
an
employment
in
his
heart
to
all
other
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
,
who
would
not
have
smile
for
the
world
,
reply
composedly
:
   
"
<EOS>
but
you
be
a
very
good
penman
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
You
tell
me
so
,
Copperfield
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
excellent
!
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
and
indeed
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
write
with
extraordinary
neatness

I
explain
to
Traddles
that
there
be
a
difficulty
in
keep
King

out
of

manuscript

Mr

in

at

suck
his

make

this
give
us
new
hope

<EOS>
Traddles
and
<EOS>
I
lay
our
head
together
apart
,
while
Mr
Dick
anxiously
watch
us
from
his
chair
,
we
concoct
a
scheme
in
virtue
of
which
we
get
him
to
work
next
day
,
with
triumphant
success
.
   
<EOS>
on
a
table
by
the
window
in
Buckingham
Street
,
we
set
out
the
work
Traddles
procure
for
him
---
which
be
to
make
<EOS>
,
I
forget
how
many
copy
of
a
legal
document
about
some
right
of
way
---
and
on
another
table
we
spread
the
last
unfinished
original
of
the
great
Memorial
.
<EOS>
Our
instruction
to
Mr
Dick
be
that
he
should
copy
exactly
what
he
have
before
him
,
without
the
least
departure
from
the
original
;
and
that
when
he
feel
it
necessary
to
make
the
slight
allusion
to
King
Charles
<EOS>
the
first
,
he
should
fly
to
the
Memorial
.
 
<EOS>
We
exhort
him
to
be
resolute
in
this
,
and
leave
my
aunt
to
observe
him
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
report
to
us
,
afterwards
,
that
,
at
first
,
he
be
like
a
man
play
the
kettle
-
drum
,
and
constantly
divide
his
attention
between
the
two
;
but
that
,
find
this
confuse
and
fatigue
him
,
and
have
his
copy
there
,
plainly
before
his
eye
,
he
soon
sit
at
it
in
an
orderly
business
-
like
manner
,
and
postpone
the
Memorial
to
a
more
convenient
time
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
although
we
take
great
care
that
he
should
have
no
more
to
do
than
be
good
for
him
,
and
although
he
do
not
begin
with
the
beginning
of
a

,
he
earn
by
the
follow
Saturday
night
ten
shilling
and
nine

pence
;
and
never
,
<EOS>
while
I
live
,
shall
I
forget

go
about
to
all
the

in
the
neighbourhood
to

this
treasure
into

I

,
that

Mr

most

announce

have
not

notice

<EOS>
indeed
I
may
be
superstitious

it
appear
to
me
that
Mr

be
destine
never

receive
any

the
great
majority
of
the
communication

write

I
may
augur

from
the
silence
of

that
they
object
to

I
should

surely

these
observation
,

indeed
the
great
part

the
observation
make
that
evening

be
interrupt
by

discovering
that
Master
Micawber
be
sit
on

hold
his
head
on

feel

loose

kick
Traddles
under

table

shuffle
his
foot
over
one
another

produce
them
at
distance
from
himself
apparently
outrageous
to
nature

lie
sideways
with
his
hair
among

wine

glass

develop
his
restlessness

limb
in
some
other
form
incompatible
with

by
Master

receive

resentful
spirit

I
sit
all
the
while

amazed
by

disclosure

wonder
what
it
mean

until
Mrs

resume
the
thread
of
the
discourse

claim
my
attention

"
what
I
particularly
request

I

the
judicial

I
hope
Mr

that
mind
will
develop
itself

take
a
commanding
station

<EOS>
I
quite
believe

Mr

himself

My

It

He

Our

"
   
<EOS>
on
look
at
Master
Micawber
again

I
see
that
he
have
a
certain
expression

face

as

his
voice
be
behind
his
eyebrow

where
it
presently
appear

<EOS>
after
many
compliment
on
this
performance
,
we
fall
into
some
general
conversation
;

as
I
be
too
full
of
my
desperate
intention
to
keep
my
alter
circumstance
to
myself

I
make
them
known

Mr

I
can

extremely
delighted
they
both
be

by
the
idea

my
aunt

be
in
difficulty

how
comfortable

friendly
it
make
them

<EOS>
when
we
be
nearly
come
to
the
last
round
of
the
punch
,
I
address
myself
to
Traddles
,

remind
him
that
we
must
not
separate
,
without
wish
our
friend
health
,
happiness
,

success
in

<EOS>
I
beg
Mr
Micawber
to
fill
us
bumper
,
and
propose
the
toast
in
due
form
:
shake
hand
with
him
across
the
table
,
and
kiss
Mrs
Micawber
,
to
commemorate
that
eventful
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
imitate
me
in
the
first
particular

do
not
consider
himself
a
sufficiently
old
friend

venture
on
the
second

"

will

Mr

five
hundred
thousand

I
should
offer
a
few
valedictory
remark
to
two
such
friend
as
I
see
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
all
that
I
have
to
say
in
this
way
,
I
have
say
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
station
in
society
I
may
attain
,
through
the
medium
of
the
learned
profession
of
which
I
be
about
to
become
an
unworthy
member

I
shall
endeavour
not

disgrace
,

Mrs

will
be
safe
to
adorn
.
 
<EOS>
under
the
temporary
pressure
of
pecuniary
liability
,
contract
with
a
view
to
their
immediate
liquidation
,
but
remain
unliquidated
through
a
combination
of
circumstance
,
I
have
be
under
the
necessity
of
assume
a
garb
from
which
my
natural
instinct
recoil
---
<EOS>
I
allude
to
spectacle
---
and
possess
myself
of
a
cognoman
,
to
which
I
can
establish
no
legitimate
pretension
.
 
<EOS>
all
I
have
to
say
on
that
score
be
,
that
the
cloud
have
pass
from
the
dreary
scene
,
and
the
God
of
Day
be
once
more
high
upon
the
mountain

<EOS>
on
Monday
next
,
on
the
arrival
of

four
o'clock
afternoon
coach
at
Canterbury

my
foot
will
be

my

Micawber

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
resume
his
seat
on
the
close
of
these
remark
,
and
drink
two
glass
of
punch
in
grave
succession
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
say
with
much
solemnity
:
   
<EOS>
"
one
thing
more
I
have
to
do
,
before
this
separation
be
complete
,
and
that
be
to
perform
an
act
of
justice
.
 
<EOS>
My
friend
Mr
Thomas
Traddles
have
,
on
two
several
occasion
,
"
put
his
name
"
,
if
I
may
use
a
common
expression
,
to
bill
of
exchange
for
my
accommodation

<EOS>
on
the
first
occasion
Mr
Thomas
Traddles
be
leave
---
let
me
say
,
in
short
,
in
the
lurch
.
 
<EOS>
the
fulfilment
of
the
second
have
not
yet
arrive

<EOS>
the
amount
of
the
first
obligation
,
"
here
Mr
Micawber
carefully
refer
to
paper
,
"
be
,
I
believe
,
twenty
-
three
,
four
,
nine

a
half

of
the
second

accord
to
my
entry
of
that
transaction

eighteen
,
six
,
two

<EOS>
these
sum
,
united
,
make
a
total
,
if
my
calculation
be
correct
,
amount
to
forty
-
one
,
ten
,
eleven
and
a
half
.
 
<EOS>
My
friend
Copperfield
will
perhaps
do
me
the
favour
to
check
that
total
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
do
so
and
find
it
correct
.
   
<EOS>
"
to
leave
this
metropolis

"
say
Mr
Micawber
,
"
and
my
friend
Mr
Thomas
Traddles
,
without
acquit
myself
of
the
pecuniary
part
of
this
obligation
,
would
weigh
upon
my
mind
to
an
insupportable
extent

<EOS>
I
have
,
therefore
,
prepare
for
my
friend
Mr
Thomas
Traddles

and
I
now
hold
in
my
hand
,
a
document

accomplish
the
desire
object

<EOS>
I
beg
to
hand
to
my

Mr

Traddles
<EOS>
my
IOU
 
for
forty
-
one
,
ten
,
eleven
and
a
half
,
<EOS>
and
I
be
happy
to
recover
my
moral
dignity
,
and
to
know
that
I
can
once
more
walk
erect
before
my
fellow
man
!
"
   
<EOS>
with
this
introduction
(
which
greatly
affect
him
)
,
Mr
Micawber
place
his
IOU
 
in
the
hand
of
Traddles
,
and
say
he
wish
him
well
in
every
relation
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
persuade
,
not
only
that
this
be
quite
the
same
to
Mr
Micawber
as
pay
the
money
,
but
that
Traddles
himself
hardly
know
the
difference
until
he
have
have
time
to
think
about
it
.
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
walk
so
erect
before
his
fellow
man
,
on
the
strength
of
this
virtuous
action
,
that
his
chest
look
half
as
broad
again
when
he
light
us
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
We
part
with
great
heartiness
on
both
side
;
and
when
I
have
see
traddle
to
his
own
door
,
and
be
go
home
alone
,
I
think
,
among
the
other
odd
and
contradictory
thing
I
muse
upon
,
that
,
slippery
as
Mr
Micawber
be
,
I
be
probably
indebted
to
some
compassionate
recollection
he
retain
of
me
as
his
boy
-
lodger
,
for
never
have
be
ask
by
him
for
money
.
<EOS>
I
certainly
should
not
have
have
the
moral
courage
to
refuse
it
;
and
I
have
no
doubt
he
know
that
(
to
his
credit
be
it
write
)
,
quite
as
well
as
I
do

<EOS>
a
little
cold
water
 
<EOS>
My
new
life
have
last
for
more
than
a
week
,
and
I
be
strong
than
ever
in
those
tremendous
practical
resolution
that
I
feel
the
crisis
require
.
 
<EOS>
I
continue
to
walk
extremely
fast
,
and
to
have
a
general
idea
that
I
be
get
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
it
a
rule
to
take
as
much
out
of
myself
as
I
possibly
could
,
in
my
way
of
do
everything
to
which
I
apply
my
energy
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
a
perfect
victim
of
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
even
entertain
some
idea
of
put
myself
on
a
vegetable
diet
,
vaguely
conceive
that
,
in
become
a
graminivorous
animal
,
I
should
sacrifice
to
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
as
yet
,
little
Dora
be
quite
unconscious
of
my
desperate
firmness
,
otherwise
than
as
my
letter
darkly
shadow
it
forth
.
 
<EOS>
but
another
Saturday
come
,
and
on
that
Saturday
evening
she
be
to
be
at
Miss
Mills
's
;
and
when
Mr
Mills
have
go
to
his
whist

club
(
telegraph
to
me
in
the
street
,
by
a
bird

cage
in
the

,
I
be
to
go
there
to
tea
.
   
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
we
be
quite
settle
down
in
Buckingham
Street
,
where
Mr
Dick
continue
his
copying
in
a
state
of
absolute
felicity
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
have
obtain
a
signal
victory
over
Mrs
Crupp
,
by
pay
her
off
,
throw
the
first
pitcher
she
plant
on
the
stair
out
of
window
,
and
protect
in
person
,
up
and
down
the
staircase
,
a
supernumerary
whom
she
engage
from
the
outer
world
.
<EOS>
these
vigorous
measure
strike
such
terror
to
the
breast
of
Mrs
Crupp
,
that
she
subside
into
her
own
kitchen
,
under
the
impression
that
my
aunt
be
mad
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
be
supremely
indifferent
to
Mrs
Crupp
's
opinion
and
everybody
else
's
,
and
rather
favour
than
discourage
the
idea
,
Mrs
Crupp
,
of
late
the
bold
,
become
within
a
few
day
so
faint
-
hearted
,
that
rather
than
encounter
my
aunt
upon
the
staircase
,
she
would
endeavour
to
hide
her
portly
form
behind
door
---
leave
visible
,
however
,
a
wide
margin
of
flannel
petticoat
---
or
would
shrink
into
dark
corner
.
 
<EOS>
this
give
my
aunt
such
unspeakable
satisfaction
,
that
I
believe
she
take
a
delight
in
prowl
up
and
down
,
with
her
bonnet
insanely
perch
on
the
top
of
her
head
,
at
time
when
Mrs
Crupp
be
likely
to
be
in
the
way
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
be
uncommonly
neat
and
ingenious
,
make
so
many
little
improvement
in
our
domestic
arrangement
,
that
I
seem
to
be
rich
instead
of
poor
.
 
<EOS>
among
the
rest
,
she
convert
the
pantry
into
a
dressing
-
room
for
me
;
and
purchase
and
embellish
a
bedstead
for
my
occupation
,
which
look
as
like
a
bookcase
in
the
daytime
as
a
bedstead
could
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
the
object
of
her
constant
solicitude
;
and
my
poor
mother
herself
could
not
have
love
me
better
,
or
study
more
how
to
make
me
happy
.
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
have
consider
herself
highly
privileged
in
be
allow
to
participate
in
these
labour
;
and
,
although
she
still
retain
something
of
her
old
sentiment
of
awe
in
reference
to
my
aunt
,
have
receive
so
many
mark
of
encouragement
and
confidence
,
that
they
be
the
good
friend
possible

<EOS>

the
time
have
now
come
<EOS>
(
I
be
speak
of
the
Saturday
when
I
be

at

when
it
be
necessary
for
her
to
return
home

enter
on
the
discharge
of
the
duty
she
have
undertake
in

of
Ham

I
be
sure
I
never

I
could
be
sorry
to
lose
you
!

<EOS>
I
take
Peggotty
to
the
coach
office
and
see
her
off
.
 
<EOS>
She
cry
at
parting
,
and
confide
her
brother
to
my
friendship
as
Ham
have
do
.
<EOS>
We
have
hear
nothing

him
since
he
go
away

that
sunny
afternoon
.
   
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
my
own
dear
Davy
,
"
say
Peggotty
,
"
if
,
while
you
be
a
prentice
,
you
should
want
any
money
to
spend
;
or
if
,
when
you
be
out
of
your
time
,
my
dear
,
you
should
want
any
to
set
you
up
(
and
you
must
do
one
or
other
,
or
both
,
my
darling
)
;
who
have
such
a
good
right
to
ask
leave
to
lend
it
you
,
as
my
sweet
girl
's
own
old
stupid
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
not
so
savagely
independent
as
to
say
anything
in
reply
,
but
that
if
ever
I
borrow
money
of
anyone
,
I
would
borrow
it
of
her
.
<EOS>
next
to
accept
a
large
sum
on
the
spot
,
I
believe
this
give
Peggotty
more
comfort
than
anything
I
could
have
do
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
,
my
dear
!
"
<EOS>
whisper
Peggotty
,
"
tell
the
pretty
little
angel
that
I
should
so
have
like
to
see
her
,
only
for
a
minute
!
 
<EOS>
and
tell
her
that
before
she
marry
my
boy
,
I
will
come
and
make
your
house
so
beautiful
for
you
,
if
you
will
let
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
declare
that
nobody
else
should
touch
it
;
and
this
give
Peggotty
such
delight
that
she
go
away
in
good
spirit
.
   
<EOS>
I
fatigue
myself
as
much
as
I
possibly
could
in
the
Commons
all
day
,
by
a
variety
of
device
,
and
at
the
appoint
time
in
the
evening
repair
to
Mr
Mills
's
street
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Mills
,
who
be
a
terrible
fellow
to
fall
asleep
after
dinner
,
have
not
yet
go
out
,
and
there
be
no
bird
-
cage
in
the
middle
window
.
   
<EOS>
He
keep
me
wait
so
long
,
that
I
fervently
hope
the
Club
would
fine
him
for
be
late
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
he
come
out
;
and
then
I
see
my
own
Dora
hang
up
the
bird
-
cage
,
and
peep
into
the
balcony
to
look
for
me
,
and
run
in
again
when
she
see
I
be
there
,
while
Jip
remain
behind
,
to
bark
injuriously
at
an
immense
butcher
's
dog
in
the
street
,
who
could
have
take
him
like
a
pill
.
   
<EOS>
Dora
come
to
the
drawing
-
room
door
to
meet
me
;
and
Jip
come
scramble
out
,
tumble
over
his
own
growl
,
under
the
impression
that
I
be
a
Bandit
;
and
we
all
three
go
in
,
as
happy
and
loving
as
could
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
soon
carry
desolation
into
the
bosom
of
our
joy
---
<EOS>
not
that
I
mean
to
do
it
,
but
that
I
be
so
full
of
the
subject
---
by
ask
Dora
,
without
the
small
preparation
,
if
she
could
love
a
beggar
?
   
<EOS>
My
pretty
,
little
,
startled
Dora
!
 
<EOS>
Her
only
association
with
the
word
be
a
yellow
face
and
a
nightcap
,
or
a
pair
of
crutch
,
or
a
wooden
leg
,
or
a
dog
with
a
decanter
-
stand
in
his
mouth
,
or
something
of
that
kind
;
and
she
stare
at
me
with
the
most
delightful
wonder
.
   
<EOS>
"
how
can
you
ask
me
anything
so
foolish
?
"
<EOS>
pout
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
love
a
beggar
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dora
,
my
own
dearest
!
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
a
beggar
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
how
can
you
be
such
a
silly
thing
,
"
reply
Dora
,
slap
my
hand
,
"
as
to
sit
there
,
tell
such
story
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
make
Jip
bite
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
Her
childish
way
be
the
most
delicious
way
in
the
world
to
me
,
but
it
be
necessary
to
be
explicit
,
and
I
solemnly
repeat
:
   
<EOS>
"
Dora
,
my
own
life
,
I
be
your
ruin
David
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
declare
I
will
make
Jip
bite
you
!
"
<EOS>
say
Dora
,
shake
her
curl
,
"
if
you
be
so
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
but
I
look
so
serious
,
that
Dora
leave
off
shake
her
curl
,
and
lay
her
tremble
little
hand
upon
my
shoulder
,
and
first
look
scared
and
anxious
,
then
begin
to
cry
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
dreadful
.
 
<EOS>
I
fall
upon
my
knee
before
the
sofa
,
caress
her
,
and
implore
her
not
to
rend
my
heart
;
but
,
for
some
time
,
poor
little
Dora
do
nothing
but
exclaim
<EOS>
oh
dear
!
 
<EOS>
oh
dear
!
 
<EOS>
and
oh
,
she
be
so
frightened
!
 
<EOS>
and
where
be
Julia
Mills
!
 
<EOS>
and
oh
,
take
her
to
Julia
Mills
,
and
go
away
,
please
!
<EOS>
until
I
be
almost
beside
myself
.
   
<EOS>
at
last
,
after
an
agony
of
supplication
and
protestation
,
I
get
Dora
to
look
at
me
,
with
a
horrified
expression
of
face
,
which
I
gradually
soothe
until
it
be
only
loving
,
and
her
soft
,
pretty
cheek
be
lie
against
mine
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
tell
her
,
with
my
arm
clasp
round
her
,
how
I
love
her
,
so
dearly
,
and
so
dearly
;
how
I
feel
it
right
to
offer
to
release
her
from
her
engagement
,
because
now
I
be
poor
;
how
I
never
could
bear
it
,
or
recover
it
,
<EOS>
if
I
lose
her
;
how
I
have
no
fear
of
poverty
,
if
she
have
none
,
my
arm
be
nerve
and
my
heart
inspire
by
her
;
how
I
be
already
work
with
a
courage
such
as
none
but
lover
know
;
how
I
have
begin
to
be
practical
,
and
look
into
the
future
;
how
a
crust
well
earn
be
sweeter
far
than
a
feast
inherit
;
and
much
more
to
the
same
purpose
,
which
I
deliver
in
a
burst
of
passionate
eloquence
quite
surprising
to
myself
,
though
I
have
be
think
about
it
,
day
and
night
,
ever
since
my
aunt
have
astonish
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
your
heart
mine
still
,
dear
Dora
?
"
say
I
,
rapturously
,
for
I
know
by
her
cling
to
me
that
it
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
!
"
cry
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
it
be
all
yours
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
do
not
be
dreadful

"
   
<EOS>
I
dreadful
!
 
<EOS>
to
Dora
!
   
<EOS>
"
do
not
talk
about
be
poor
,
and
work
hard
!
"
<EOS>
say
Dora
,
nestle
closer
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
do
not
,
do
not
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
love
,
"
say
I
,
"
the
crust
well
-
earn
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
;
but
I
do
not
want
to
hear
any
more
about
crust
!
"
say
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
Jip
must
have
a
mutton
-
chop
every
day
at
twelve
,
or
he
will
die
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
charm
with
her
childish
,
win
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
fondly
explain
to
Dora
that
Jip
should
have
his
mutton
-
chop
with
his
accustomed
regularity
.
 
<EOS>
I
draw
a
picture
of
our
frugal
home
,
make
independent
by
my
labour
---
sketch
in
the
little
house
I
have
see
at
Highgate
,
and
my
aunt
in
her
room
upstairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
dreadful
now
,
Dora
?
"
say
I
,
tenderly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
no
,
no
!
"
cry
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
hope
your
aunt
will
keep
in
her
own
room
a
good
deal
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
hope
she
be
not
a
scold
old
thing
!
"
   
<EOS>
if
it
be
possible
for
me
to
love
Dora
more
than
ever
,
I
be
sure
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
feel
she
be
a
little
impracticable
.
 
<EOS>
It
damp
my
new
-
bear
ardour
,
to
find
that
ardour
so
difficult
of
communication
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
another
trial
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
be
quite
herself
again
,
and
be
curl
Jip
's
ear
,
as
he
lie
upon
her
lap
,
I
become
grave
,
and
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
My
own
!
 
<EOS>
May
I
mention
something
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
please
do
not
be
practical
!
"
<EOS>
say
Dora
,
coaxingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
because
it
frighten
me
so
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
sweetheart
!
"
<EOS>
I
return
;
"
there
be
nothing
to
alarm
you
in
all
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
think
of
it
quite
differently
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
make
it
nerve
you
,
and
inspire
you
,
Dora

"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
but
that
be
so
shocking
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
love
,
no

perseverance
and
strength
of
character
will
enable
us
to
bear
much
bad
thing
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
but
I
have
not
get
any
strength
at
all
,
"
say
Dora
,
shake
her
curl
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
I
,
Jip
?
 
<EOS>
oh
,
do
kiss
Jip
,
and
be
agreeable
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
resist
kiss
Jip
,
when
she
hold
him
up
to
me
for
that
purpose
,
put
her
own
bright
,
rosy
little
mouth
into
kissing
form
,
as
she
direct
the
operation
,
which
she
insist
should
be
perform
symmetrically
,
on
the
centre
of
his
nose
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
as
she
bid
me
---
reward
myself
afterwards
for
my
obedience
---
<EOS>
and
she
charm
me
out
of
my
graver
character
for
I
do
not
know
how
long
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
,
Dora
,
my
beloved
!
"
<EOS>
say
I
,
at
last
resume
it
;
"
I
be
go
to
mention
something
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
judge
of
the
Prerogative
Court
may
have
fall
in
love
with
her
,
to
see
her
fold
her
little
hand
and
hold
them
up
,
beg
and
pray
me
not
to
be
dreadful
any
more
.
   
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
be
not
go
to
be
,
my
darling
!
<EOS>
"
I
assure
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
Dora
,
my
love
,
if
you
will
sometimes
think
,
---
not
despondingly
,
you
know
;
far
from
that
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
but
if
you
will
sometimes
think
---
just
to
encourage
yourself
---
that
you
be
engage
to
a
poor
man
---
"
   
"
do
not
,
do
not
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
do
not

"
cry
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
so
very
dreadful
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
soul
,
not
at
all
!
"
say
I
,
cheerfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
sometimes
think
of
that
,
and
look
about
now
and
then
at
your
papa
's
housekeeping
,
and
endeavour
to
acquire
a
little
habit
---
of
account
,
for
instance
---
"
   
poor
little
Dora
receive
this
suggestion
with
something
that
be
half
a
sob
and
half
a
scream
.
   
<EOS>
"
---
It
would
be
so
useful
to
us
afterwards
,
"
I
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
if
you
would
promise
me
to
read
a
little
---
a
little
Cookery
Book
that
I
would
send
you
,
it
would
be
so
excellent
for
both
of
us

<EOS>
for
our
path
in
life

Dora

I
,
warm
with
the
subject

be
stony
and
rugge
now

it
rest
with
us
to
smooth
it

<EOS>
We
must
fight
our
way
onward
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
be
brave
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
obstacle
to
be
meet
,
and
we
must
meet
,
and
crush
them
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
go
on
at
a
great
rate
,
with
a
clenched
hand
,
and
a
most
enthusiastic
countenance
;
but
it
be
quite
unnecessary
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
I
have
say
enough
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
do
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
she
be
so
frightened
!
 
<EOS>
oh
,
where
be
Julia
Mills
!
 
<EOS>
oh
,
take
her
to
Julia
Mills
,
and
go
away
,
please
!
 
<EOS>
so
that
,
in
short
,
I
be
quite
distract
,
and
rave
about
the
drawing
-
room
.
   
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
kill
her
,
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
sprinkle
water
on
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
down
on
my
knee
.
 
<EOS>
I
pluck
at
my
hair
.
 
<EOS>
I
denounce
myself
as
a
remorseless
brute
and
a
ruthless
beast
.
 
<EOS>
I
implore
her
forgiveness
.
 
<EOS>
I
beseech
her
to
look
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
ravage
Miss
Mills
's
work
-
box
for
a
smell
-
bottle
,
and
in
my
agony
of
mind
apply
an
ivory
needle
-
case
instead
,
and
drop
all
the
needle
over
Dora
.
<EOS>
I
shake
my
fist
at
Jip
,
who
be
as
frantic
as
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
every
wild
extravagance
that
could
be
do
,
and
be
a
long
way
beyond
the
end
of
my
wit
when
Miss
Mills
come
into
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
who
have
do
this
?
"
exclaim
Miss
Mills
,
succour
her
friend
.
   
<EOS>
I
reply
,
"
I
,
Miss
Mills
!
<EOS>
I
have
do
it
!
 
<EOS>
Behold
the
destroyer
!
"
<EOS>
---
or
word
to
that
effect
---
and
hide
my
face
from
the
light
,
in
the
sofa
cushion
.
   
<EOS>
at
first
Miss
Mills
think
it
be
a
quarrel
,
and
that
we
be
verge
on
the
Desert
of
Sahara
;
but
she
soon
find
out
how
matter
stand
,
for
my
dear
affectionate
little
Dora
,
embrace
her
,
begin
exclaim
that
I
be
"
a
poor
labourer
"
;
and
then
cry
for
me
,
and
embrace
me
,
and
ask
me
would
I
let
her
give
me
all
her
money
to
keep
,
and
then
fall
on
Miss
Mills
's
neck
,
sob
as
if
her
tender
heart
be
break
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
must
have
be
bear
to
be
a
blessing
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
She
ascertain
from
me
in
a
few
word
what
it
be
all
about
,
comfort
Dora
,
and
gradually
convince
her
that
I
be
not
a
labourer
---
from
my
manner
of
state
the
case
I
believe
Dora
conclude
that
I
be
a
navigator
,
and
go
balance
myself
up
and
down
a
plank
all
day
with
a
wheelbarrow
---
and
so
bring
us
together
in
peace
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
be
quite
compose
,
and
Dora
have
go
up
-
stair
to
put
some
rose
-
water
to
her
eye
,
Miss
Mills
ring
for
tea
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
ensue
interval
,
I
tell
Miss
Mills
that
she
be
evermore
my
friend
,
and
that
my
heart
must
cease
to
vibrate
ere
<EOS>
I
could
forget
her
sympathy
.
   
<EOS>
I
then
expound
to
Miss
Mills
what
I
have
endeavour
,
so
very
unsuccessfully
,
to
expound
to
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
reply
,
on
general
principle
,
that
the
Cottage
of
content
be
well
than
the
Palace
of
cold
splendour
,
and
that
where
love
be
,
all
be
.
   
<EOS>
I
say
to
Miss
Mills
that
this
be
very
true
,
and
who
should
know
it
better
than
I
,
who
love
Dora
with
a
love
that
never
mortal
have
experience
yet
?
 
<EOS>
but
on
Miss
Mills
observe
,
with
despondency
,
that
it
be
well
indeed
for
some
heart
if
this
be
so
,
I
explain
that
I
beg
leave
to
restrict
the
observation
to
mortal
of
the
masculine
gender
.
   
<EOS>
I
then
put
it
to
Miss
Mills
,
to
say
whether
she
consider
that
there
be
or
be
not
any
practical
merit
in
the
suggestion
I
have
be
anxious
to
make
,
concern
the
account
,
the
housekeeping
,
and
the
Cookery
Book
?
   
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
,
after
some
consideration
,
thus
reply
:
   
"
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
,
I
will
be
plain
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
mental
suffering
and
trial
supply
,
in
some
nature
,
the
place
of
year
,
and
I
will
be
as
plain
with
you
as
if
I
be
a
Lady
Abbess
.
 
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
the
suggestion
be
not
appropriate
to
our
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
Our
dearest
<EOS>
Dora
be
a
favourite
child
of
nature
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
thing
of
light
,
and
airiness
,
and
joy
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
free
to
confess
that
if
it
could
be
do
,
it
may
be
well
,
<EOS>
but
---
"
and
Miss
Mills
shake
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
encourage
by
this
closing
admission
on
the
part
of
Miss
Mills
to
ask
her
,
whether
,
for
Dora
's
sake
,
if
she
have
any
opportunity
of
lure
her
attention
to
such
preparation
for
an
earnest
life
,
she
would
avail
herself
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
reply
in
the
affirmative
so
readily
,
that
I
further
ask
her
if
she
would
take
charge
of
the
Cookery
Book
;
and
,
if
she
ever
could
insinuate
it
upon
Dora
's
acceptance
,
without
frighten
her
,
undertake
to
do
me
that
crowning
service
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
accept
this
trust
,
too
;
but
be
not
sanguine
.
   
<EOS>
and
Dora
return
,
look
such
a
lovely
little
creature
,
that
I
really
doubt
whether
she
ought
to
be
trouble
with
anything
so
ordinary
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
love
me
so
much
,
and
be
so
captivate
(
particularly
when
she
make
Jip
stand
on
his
hind
leg
for
toast
,
and
when
she
pretend
to
hold
that
nose
of
his
against
the
hot
teapot
for
punishment
because
he
would
not
)
,
that
I
feel
like
a
sort
of
monster
who
have
get
into
a
Fairy
's
bower
,
when
I
think
of
have
frighten
her
,
and
make
her
cry
.
   
<EOS>
after
tea
we
have
the
guitar
;
and
Dora
sing
those
same
dear
old
french
song
about
the
impossibility
of
ever
on
any
account
leave
off
dance
,
La
ra
la
,
<EOS>
La
ra
la
,
until
I
feel
a
much
great
monster
than
before
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
only
one
check
to
our
pleasure
,
and
that
happen
a
little
while
before
I
take
my
leave
,
when
,
Miss
Mills
chance
to
make
some
allusion
to
tomorrow
morning
,
I
unluckily
let
out
that
,
be
oblige
to
exert
myself
now
<EOS>
,
I
get
up
at
five
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
whether
Dora
have
any
idea
that
I
be
a
private
Watchman
,
I
be
unable
to
say
;
but
it
make
a
great
impression
on
her
,
and
she
neither
play
nor
sing
any
more
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
still
on
her
mind
when
I
bid
her
adieu
;
and
she
say
to
me
,
in
her
pretty
coaxing
way
---
as
if
I
be
a
doll
,
I
use
to
think
:
   
"
now
do
not
get
up
at
five
o'clock
,
<EOS>
you
naughty
boy
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
nonsensical
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
have
work
to
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
but
do
not
do
it
!
"
<EOS>
return
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
should
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
say
to
that
sweet
little
surprised
face
,
otherwise
than
lightly
and
playfully
,
that
we
must
work
to
live
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
how
ridiculous
!
"
cry
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
"
how
shall
we
live
without
,
Dora
?
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
how
?
 
<EOS>
any
how
!
"
say
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
She
seem
to
think
she
have
quite
settle
the
question
,
and
give
me
such
a
triumphant
little
kiss
,
direct
from
her
innocent
heart
,
that
I
would
hardly
have
put
her
out
of
conceit
with
her
answer
,
for
a
fortune
.
   
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
I
love
her
,
and
I
go
on
love
her
,
most
absorbingly
,
entirely
,
and
completely
.
 
<EOS>
but
go
on
,
too
,
work
pretty
hard
,
and
busily
keep
red
-
hot
all
the
iron
I
now
have
in
the
fire
,
I
would
sit
sometimes
of
a
night
,
opposite
my
aunt
,
think
how
I
have
frighten
Dora
that
time
,
and
how
I
could
best
make
my
way
with
a
guitar
-
case
through
the
forest
of
difficulty
,
until
I
use
to
fancy
that
my
head
be
turn
quite
grey
.

Chapter
38
.
<EOS>
a
dissolution
of
partnership
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
allow
my
resolution
,
with
respect
to
the
Parliamentary
Debates
,
to
cool
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
the
iron
I
begin
to
heat
immediately
,
and
one
of
the
iron
I
keep
hot
,
and
hammer
at
,
with
a
perseverance
I
may
honestly
admire
.
 
<EOS>
I
buy
an
approve
scheme
of
the
noble
art
and
mystery
of
stenography
(
which
cost
me
ten
and
sixpence
)
;
and
plunge
into
a
sea
of
perplexity
that
bring
me
,
in
a
few
week
,
to
the
confine
of
distraction
.
 
<EOS>
the
change
that
be
ring
upon
dot
,
which
in
such
a
position
mean
such
a
thing
,
and
in
such
another
position
something
else
,
entirely
different
;
the
wonderful
vagary
that
be
play
by
circle
;
the
unaccountable
consequence
that
result
from
mark
like
fly
'
leg
;
the
tremendous
effect
of
a
curve
in
a
wrong
place
;
not
only
trouble
my
wake
hour
,
but
reappear
before
me
in
my
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
grope
my
way
,
blindly
,
through
these
difficulty
,
and
have
master
the
alphabet
,
which
be
an
egyptian
Temple
in
itself
,
there
then
appear
a
procession
of
new
horror
,
call
arbitrary
character
;
the
most
despotic
character
I
have
ever
know
;
who
insist
,
for
instance
,
that
a
thing
like
the
beginning
of
a
cobweb
,
mean
expectation
,
and
that
a
pen
-
and
-
ink
sky
-
rocket
,
stand
for
disadvantageous
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
fix
these
wretch
in
my
mind
,
I
find
that
they
have
drive
everything
else
out
of
it
;
then
,
begin
again
,
I
forget
them
;
while
I
be
pick
them
up
,
I
drop
the
other
fragment
of
the
system
;
in
short
,
it
be
almost
heart
-
breaking
.
   
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
quite
heart
-
break
,
but
for
Dora
,
who
be
the
stay
and
anchor
of
my
tempest
-
drive
bark
.
 
<EOS>
every
scratch
in
the
scheme
be
a
gnarl
oak
in
the
forest
of
difficulty
,
and
I
go
on
cut
them
down
,
one
after
another
,
with
such
vigour
,
that
in
three
or
four
month
I
be
in
a
condition
to
make
an
experiment
on
one
of
our
crack
speaker
in
the
Commons
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
ever
forget
how
the
crack
speaker
walk
off
from
me
before
I
begin
,
and
leave
my
imbecile
pencil
stagger
about
the
paper
as
if
it
be
in
a
fit
!
   
<EOS>
this
would
not
do
,
it
be
quite
clear
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
fly
too
high
,
and
should
never
get
on
,
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
resort
to
Traddles
for
advice
;
who
suggest
that
he
should
dictate
speech
to
me
,
at
a
pace
,
and
with
occasional
stoppage
,
adapt
to
my
weakness
.
 
<EOS>
very
grateful
for
this
friendly
aid
,
I
accept
the
proposal
;
and
night
after
night
,
almost
every
night
,
for
a
long
time
,
we
have
a
sort
of
Private
Parliament
in
Buckingham
Street
,
after
I
come
home
from
the
Doctor
's
.
   
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
see
such
a
Parliament
anywhere
else
!
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
and
Mr
Dick
represent
the
Government
or
the
opposition
(
as
the
case
may
be
)
,
and
Traddles
,
with
the
assistance
of
Enfield
's
Speakers
,
or
a
volume
of
parliamentary
oration
,
thunder
astonishing
invective
against
them
.
 
<EOS>
stand
by
the
table
,
with
his
finger
in
the
page
to
keep
the
place
,
and
his
right
arm
flourish
above
his
head
,
Traddles
,
as
Mr
Pitt
,
Mr
Fox
,
Mr
Sheridan
,
Mr
Burke
,
Lord
Castlereagh
,
Viscount
Sidmouth
,
or
Mr
Canning
,
would
work
himself
into
the
most
violent
heat
,
and
deliver
the
most
wither
denunciation
of
the
profligacy
and
corruption
of
my
aunt
and
Mr
Dick
;
while
I
use
to
sit
,
at
a
little
distance
,
with
my
notebook
on
my
knee
,
fag
after
him
with
all
my
might
and
main
.
 
<EOS>
the
inconsistency
and
recklessness
of
Traddles
be
not
to
be
exceed
by
any
real
politician
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
for
any
description
of
policy
,
in
the
compass
of
a
week
;
and
nail
all
sort
of
colour
to
every
denomination
of
mast
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
look
very
like
an
immovable
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
would
occasionally
throw
in
an
interruption
or
two
,
as
"
Hear
!
"
or
"
no
!
"
or
"
oh
!
"
when
the
text
seem
to
require
it
:
which
be
always
a
signal
to
Mr
Dick
(
a
perfect
country
gentleman
)
to
follow
lustily
with
the
same
cry
.
<EOS>
but
Mr
Dick
get
tax
with
such
thing
in
the
course
of
his
Parliamentary
career
,
and
be
make
responsible
for
such
awful
consequence
,
that
he
become
uncomfortable
in
his
mind
sometimes
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
actually
begin
to
be
afraid
he
really
have
be
do
something
,
tend
to
the
annihilation
of
the
british
constitution
,
and
the
ruin
of
the
country
.
   
<EOS>
often
and
often
we
pursue
these
debate
until
the
clock
point
to
midnight
,
and
the
candle
be
burn
down
.
 
<EOS>
the
result
of
so
much
good
practice
be
,
that
by
and
by
I
begin
to
keep
pace
with
traddle
pretty
well
,
and
should
have
be
quite
triumphant
if
I
have
have
the
least
idea
what
my
note
be
about
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
to
read
them
after
I
have
get
them
,
I
may
as
well
have
copy
the
chinese
inscription
of
an
immense
collection
of
tea
-
chest
,
or
the
golden
character
on
all
the
great
red
and
green
bottle
in
the
chemist
'
shop
!
   
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
for
it
,
but
to
turn
back
and
begin
all
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
hard
,
but
I
turn
back
,
though
with
a
heavy
heart
,
and
begin
laboriously
and
methodically
to
plod
over
the
same
tedious
ground
at
a
snail
's
pace
;
stop
to
examine
minutely
every
speck
in
the
way
,
on
all
side
,
and
make
the
most
desperate
effort
to
know
these
elusive
character
by
sight
wherever
I
meet
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
always
punctual
at
the
office
;
at
the
Doctor
be
too
:
and
I
really
do
work
,
as
the
common
expression
be
,
like
a
cart
-
horse
.
<EOS>
one
day
,
when
I
go
to
the
Commons
as
usual
,
I
find
Mr
Spenlow
in
the
doorway
look
extremely
grave
,
and
talk
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
be
in
the
habit
of
complain
of
pain
in
his
head
---
he
have
naturally
a
short
throat
,
and
I
do
seriously
believe
he
over
-
starched
himself
---
<EOS>
I
be
at
first
alarm
by
the
idea
that
he
be
not
quite
right
in
that
direction
;
but
he
soon
relieve
my
uneasiness
.
   
<EOS>
instead
of
return
my
"
good
morning
"
with
his
usual
affability
,
he
look
at
me
in
a
distant
,
ceremonious
manner
,
and
coldly
request
me
to
accompany
him
to
a
certain
coffee
-
house
,
which
,
in
those
day
,
have
a
door
opening
into
the
Commons
,
just
within
the
little
archway
in
St
Paul
's
Churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
I
comply
,
in
a
very
uncomfortable
state
,
and
with
a
warm
shooting
all
over
me
,
as
if
my
apprehension
be
break
out
into
bud
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
allow
him
to
go
on
a
little
before
,
on
account
of
the
narrowness
of
the
way
,
I
observe
that
he
carry
his
head
with
a
lofty
air
that
be
particularly
unpromising
;
and
my
mind
misgave
me
that
he
have
find
out
about
my
darling
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
if
I
have
not
guess
this
,
on
the
way
to
the
coffee
-
house
,
I
could
hardly
have
fail
to
know
what
be
the
matter
when
I
follow
him
into
an
upstairs
room
,
and
find
Miss
Murdstone
there
,
support
by
a
background
of
sideboard
,
on
which
be
several
invert
tumbler
sustain
lemon
,
and
two
of
those
extraordinary
box
,
all
corner
and
fluting
,
for
stick
knife
and
fork
in
,
which
,
happily
for
mankind
,
be
now
obsolete
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
give
me
her
chilly
finger
-
nail
,
and
sit
severely
rigid
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
shut
the
door
,
motion
me
to
a
chair
,
and
stand
on
the
hearth
-
rug
in
front
of
the
fireplace
.
   
<EOS>
"
have
the
goodness
to
show
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
say
Mr
Spenlow
,
"
what
you
have
in
your
reticule
,
Miss
Murdstone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
believe
it
be
the
old
identical
steel
-
clasp
reticule
of
my
childhood
,
that
shut
up
like
a
bite
.
 
<EOS>
compress
her
lip
,
in
sympathy
with
the
snap
,
Miss
Murdstone
open
it
---
open
her

Mr

seem
quite

by

<EOS>
I
incline
my
head
in
acquiescence

I
should
not
allow

say
Mr
Spenlow
,
with
an
evident
increase
of
pious
sentiment
,
and
slowly
shake
his
head
as
he
poise
himself
upon
his
toe
and
heel
alternately

my
suitable
provision

my

It

folly

mere
nonsense

little
while

it
will
weigh
light

I
may

I
may
---
if
this
silly
business
be
not
completely
relinquish
altogether

be
induce
in
some
anxious
moment
to
guard
her
from
,

surround
her
with
protection
against

the
consequence

any
foolish
step

now
,
Mr
Copperfield

I
hope
that
you

not

it
necessary

me
to
open

even
for
a
quarter

an
hour

"
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
serenity
,
a
tranquillity
,
a
calm
sunset
air
about
him
,
which
quite
affect
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
so
peaceful
and
resign
---
clearly
have
his
affair
in
such
perfect
train
,
and
so
systematically
wound
up
---
that
he
be
a
man
to
feel
touch
in
the
contemplation
of
.
 
<EOS>
I
really
think
I
see
tear
rise
to
his
eye
,
from
the
depth
of
his
own
feeling
of
all
this
.
   
<EOS>
but
what
could
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
deny
Dora
and
my
own
heart
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
tell
me
I
have
better
take
a
week
to
consider
of
what
he
have
say
,
how
could
I
say
I
would
not
take
a
week

how
could
I
fail
to
know

no

week
could
influence
such
love

mine

<EOS>
"
in

,
confer
with

Trotwood

Mr

<EOS>
I
submit
;

,
with
a
countenance
as
expressive
as
I
be
able
to
make
it
of
dejected
and
despairing
constancy
,
come
out
of
the
room

<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
's
heavy
eyebrow
follow
me
to
the
door
---
I
say
her
eyebrow
rather
than
her
eye
,
because
they
be
much
more
important
in
her
face
---
and
she
look
so
exactly
as
she
use
to
look
,
at
about
that
hour
of
the
morning
,
in
our
parlour
at
Blunderstone
,
that
I
could
have
fancy
I
have
be
break
down
in
my
lesson
again
,
and
that
the
dead
weight
on
my
mind
be
that
horrible
old
spelling
-
book
,
with
oval
woodcut
,
shape
,
to
my
youthful
fancy
,
like
the
glass
out
of
spectacle

<EOS>
when
I
get
to
the
office
,
and
,
shut
out
old
Tiffey
and
the
rest
of
them
with
my
hand
,
sit
at
my
desk
,
in
my
own
particular
nook
,
thinking
of
this
earthquake
that
have
take
place
so
unexpectedly
,
and
in
the
bitterness
of
my
spirit
cursing
Jip
,
I
fall
into
such
a
state
of
torment
about
Dora
,
that
I
wonder
I
do
not
take
up
my
hat
and
rush
insanely
to
Norwood
.
 
<EOS>
the
idea
of
their
frightening
her
,
and
make
her
cry
,
and
of
my
not
be
there
to
comfort
her
,
be
so
excruciating
,
that
it
impel
me
to
write
a
wild
letter
to
Mr
Spenlow
,
beseech
him
not
to
visit
upon
her
the
consequence
of
my
awful
destiny
.
 
<EOS>
I
implore
him
to
spare
her
gentle
nature
---
not
to
crush
a
fragile
flower
---
and
address
him
generally
,
to
the
good
of
my
remembrance
,
<EOS>
as
if
,
instead
of
be
her
father
,
he
have
be
an
Ogre
,
or
the
Dragon
of
Wantley.3
<EOS>
this
letter
I
seal
and
lay
upon
his
desk
before
he
return
;
and
when
he
come
in
,
I
see
him
,
through
the
half
-
open
door
of
his
room
,
take
it
up
and
read
it
.
   
<EOS>
He
say
nothing
about
it
all
the
morning
;
but
before
he
go
away
in
the
afternoon
he
call
me
in
,
and
tell
me
that
I
need
not
make
myself
at
all
uneasy
about
his
daughter
's
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
assure
her
,
he
say
,
that
it
be
all
nonsense
;
and
he
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
believe
he
be
an
indulgent
father
<EOS>
(
as
indeed
he
be
)
,
and
I
may
spare
myself
any
solicitude
on
her
account
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
make
it
necessary
,
if
you
be
foolish

obstinate

Mr
Copperfield

"
he
observe
,
"
for
me
to
send
my
daughter
abroad
again
,
for
a
term
;
but
I
have
a
well
opinion

you
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
be
wise
than
that
,
in
a
few
day

as
to

I

I
respect
that
lady
's
vigilance

feel
obliged

her

she
have
strict
charge
to
avoid
the
subject

<EOS>
all
I
desire
,
Mr

be
,
that
it
should
be
forget
.
 
<EOS>
all
you
have
get
to
do
,
Mr
Copperfield

be
to
forget
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
all
!
 
<EOS>
in
the
note
I
write
to
Miss
Mills
,
I
bitterly
quote
this
sentiment
.
 
<EOS>
all
I
have
to
do
,
I
say
,
with
gloomy
sarcasm
,
be
to
forget
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
all
,
and
what
be
that
!
 
<EOS>
I
entreat
Miss
Mills
to
see
me
,
that
evening
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
could
not
be
do
with
Mr
Mills
's
sanction
and
concurrence
,
I
besought
a
clandestine
interview
in
the
back
kitchen
where
the
Mangle
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
inform
her
that
my
reason
be
totter
on
its
throne
,
and
only
she
,
Miss
Mills
,
could
prevent
its
be
depose
.
 
<EOS>
I
sign
myself
,
hers
distractedly
;
and
I
could
not
help
feel
,
while
I
read
this
composition
over
,
before
send
it
by
a
porter
,
that
it
be
something
in
the
style
of
Mr
Micawber
.
   
<EOS>
however
,
I
send
it
.
 
<EOS>
at
night
I
repair
to
Miss
Mills
's
street
,
and
walk
up
and
down
,
until
I
be
stealthily
fetch
in
by
Miss
Mills
's
maid
,
and
take
the
area
way
to
the
back
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
since
see
reason
to
believe
that
there
be
nothing
on
earth
to
prevent
my
go
in
at
the
front
door
,
and
be
show
up
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
except
Miss
Mills
's
love
of
the
romantic
and
mysterious
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
back
kitchen
,
I
rave
as
become
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
there
,
I
suppose
,
to
make
a
fool
of
myself
,
and
I
be
quite
sure
I
do
it
.
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
have
receive
a
hasty
note
from
Dora
,
tell
her
that
all
be
discover
,
and
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
pray
come
to
me
,
Julia
,
do
,
do
!
"
<EOS>
but
Miss
Mills
,
mistrust
the
acceptability
of
her
presence
to
the
high
power
,
have
not
yet
go
;
and
we
be
all
benight
in
the
Desert
of
Sahara
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
have
a
wonderful
flow
of
word
,
and
like
to
pour
them
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
feel
,
though
she
mingle
her
tear
with
mine
,
that
she
have
a
dreadful
luxury
in
our
affliction
.
 
<EOS>
She
pet
them
,
as
I
may
say
,
and
make
the
most
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
a
deep
gulf
,
she
observe
,
have
open
between
Dora
and
me
,
and
Love
could
only
span
it
with
its
rainbow
.
 
<EOS>
love
must
suffer
in
this
stern
world
;
it
ever
have
be
so
,
it
ever
would
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
no
matter
,
Miss
Mills
remark
.
 
<EOS>
heart
confine
by
cobwebs
would
burst
at
last
,
and
then
Love
be
avenge
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
small
consolation
,
but
Miss
Mills
would
not
encourage
fallacious
hope
.
 
<EOS>
She
make
me
much
more
wretched
than
I
be
before
,
and
I
feel
(
and
tell
her
with
the
deep
gratitude
)
that
she
be
indeed
a
friend
.
 
<EOS>
We
resolve
that
she
should
go
to
Dora
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
,
and
find
some
mean
of
assure
her
,
either
by
look
or
word
,
of
my
devotion
and
misery
.
 
<EOS>
We
part
,
overwhelm
with
grief
;
and
<EOS>
I
think
Miss
Mills
enjoy
herself
completely
.
   
<EOS>
I
confide
all
to
my
aunt
when
I
get
home
;
and
in
spite
of
all
she
could
say
to
me
,
go
to
bed
despairing
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
up
despair
,
and
go
out
despair
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Saturday
morning
,
and
I
go
straight
to
the
Commons
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
,
when
I
come
within
sight
of
our
office
-
door
,
to
see
the
ticket
-
porter
stand
outside
talk
together
,
and
some
half
-
dozen
straggler
gaze
at
the
window
which
be
shut
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
quicken
my
pace
,
and
,
pass
among
them
,
wonder
at
their
look
,
go
hurriedly
in
.
   
<EOS>
the
clerk
be
there
,
but
nobody
be
do
anything
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Tiffey
,
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
I
should
think
,
be
sit
on
somebody
else
's
stool
,
and
have
not
hang
up
his
hat
.
   
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
dreadful
calamity
,
Mr
Copperfield
,

say
he
,
as
I
enter

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"

Tiffey

all
the

of
them

come
round
me

<EOS>
"
no

I
,

it

not

as
one
of
the

catch
hold
of
me

<EOS>
They
sit
me
down
in
a
chair

untie
my

cloth
,
and
bring
me
some
water

"
   
<EOS>
I
can
not
describe
the
state
of
mind
into
which
I
be
throw
by
this
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
the
shock
of
such
an
event
happen
so
suddenly
,
and
happen
to
one
with
whom
I
have
be
in
any
respect
at
variance
---
the
appalling
vacancy
in
the
room
he
have
occupy
so
lately
,
where
his
chair
and
table
seem
to
wait
for
him
,
and
his
handwriting
of
yesterday
be
like
a
ghost
---
the
indefinable
impossibility
of
separate
him
from
the
place
,
and
feeling
,
when
the
door
open
,
as
if
he
may
come
in
---
the
lazy
hush
and
rest
<EOS>
there
be
in
the
office
,
and
the
insatiable
relish
with
which
our
people
talk
about
it
,
and
other
people
come
in
and
out
all
day
,
and
gorge
themselves
with
the
subject
---
this
be
easily
intelligible
to
anyone
.
 
<EOS>
what
I
can
not
describe
be
,
how
,
in
the
innermost
recess
of
my
own
heart
,
I
have
a
lurking
jealousy
even
of
death
.
 
<EOS>
how
I
feel
as
if
its
might
would
push
me
from
my
ground
in
Dora
's
thought
.
 
<EOS>
how
I
be
,
in
a
grudging
way
I
have
no
word
for
,
envious
of
her
grief
.
 
<EOS>
how
it
make
me
restless
to
think
of
her
weeping
to
other
,
or
be
console
by
other
.
 
<EOS>
how
I
have
a
grasping
,
avaricious
wish
to
shut
out
everybody
from
her
but
myself
,
and
to
be
all
in
all
to
her
,
at
that
unseasonable
time
of
all
time

<EOS>
in
the
trouble
of
this
state
of
mind
---
not
exclusively
my
own
,
I
hope
,
but
know
to
other
---
I
go
down
to
Norwood
that
night
;
and
find
from
one
of
the
servant
,
when
I
make
my
inquiry
at
the
door

that
Miss
Mills
be
there

get
my
aunt
to
direct
a
letter
to
her
,
which
I
write
.
 
<EOS>
I
deplore
the
untimely
death
of
Mr
Spenlow
,
most
sincerely
,
and
shed
tear
in
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
entreat
her
to
tell
Dora
,
if
Dora
be
in
a
state
to
hear
it
,
that
he
have
speak
to
me
with
the
utmost
kindness
and
consideration
;
and
have
couple
nothing
but
tenderness
,
not
a
single
or
reproachful
word
,
with
her
name
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
I
do
this
selfishly
,
to
have
my
name
bring
before
her
;
but
I
try
to
believe
it
be
an
act
of
justice
to
his
memory
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
do
believe
it
.
   
<EOS>
My

receive
a
few
line
next

in
reply

address

outside

within

<EOS>
Dora
be
overcome
by
grief
;
and
when
her
friend
have
ask
her
should
she
send
her
love
to
me

have
only
cry

as

be
always
cry

"

Mr

who
have
be
at
Norwood
since

come
to
the
office
a
few
day
afterwards

<EOS>
He
and
Tiffey
be
closet
together
for
some
few
moment

then
Tiffey
look
out
at

beckon
me
in

Mr

Mr

myself

Mr

be
about

examine

other
such
repository
of
the

with
the

up

for

there
be
no

It
may
be
as
well
for
you
to
assist
us
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
have
be
in
agony
to
obtain
some
knowledge
of
the
circumstance
in
which
my
Dora
would
be
place
---
as
,
in
whose
guardianship
,
and
so
forth
---
and
this
be
something
towards
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
begin
the
search
at
once
;
Mr
jorkin
unlock
the
drawer
and
desk
,
and
we
all
take
out
the
paper
.
 
<EOS>
the
office
-
paper
we
place
on
one
side
,
and
the
private
paper
(
which
be
not
numerous
)
on
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
very
grave
;
and
when
we
come
to
a
stray
seal
,
or
pencil
-
case
,
or
ring
,
or
any
little
article
of
that
kind
which
we
associate
personally
with
him
,
we
speak
very
low
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
seal
up
several
packet
;
and
be
still
go
on
dustily
and
quietly
,
when
Mr
jorkin
say
to
us
,
apply
exactly
the
same
word
to
his
late
partner
as
his
late
partner
have
apply
to
him
:
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr

be
very
difficult

move
from

beaten
track

<EOS>
You
know
what
he
be

<EOS>
I
be
dispose
to
think
he
have
make
no
will
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
I
know
he
have
!
"
say
I.
   
They
both
stop
and
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
on
the
very
day
when
I
last
see
him
,
"
say
I
,
"
he
tell
me
that
he
have
,
and
that
his
affair
be
long
since
settle
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
jorkin
and
old
Tiffey
shake
their
head
with
one
accord
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
look
unpromising
,
"
say
Tiffey
.
   
<EOS>
"
very
unpromising
,
"
say
Mr
jorkin
.
   
<EOS>
"
surely
you
do
not
doubt
---
"
I
begin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
good
Mr
Copperfield
!
"
say
Tiffey
,
lay
his
hand
upon
my
arm
,
and
shut
up
both
his
eye
as
he
shake
his
head
:
"
if
you
have
be
in
the
Commons
as
long
as
I
have
,
you
would
know
that
there
be
no
subject
on
which
man
be
so
inconsistent
,
and
so
little
to
be
trust
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
bless
my
soul
,
he
make
that
very
remark
!
<EOS>
"
I
reply
persistently
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
call
that
almost
final
,
"
observe
Tiffey
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
opinion
be
---
no
will
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
appear
a
wonderful
thing
to
me
,
but
it
turn
out
that
there
be
no
will
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
never
so
much
as
thought
of
make
one
,
so
far
as
his
paper
afford
any
evidence
;
for
there
be
no
kind
of
hint
,
sketch
,
or
memorandum
,
of
any
testamentary
intention
<EOS>
whatever
.
<EOS>
what
be
scarcely
less
astonishing
to
me
,
be
,
that
his
affair
be
in
a
most
disorder
state
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
extremely
difficult
,
I
hear
,
to
make
out
what
he
owe
,
or
what
he
have
pay
,
or
of
what
he
die
possess
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
consider
likely
that
for
year
he
could
have
have
no
clear
opinion
on
these
subject
himself
.
 
<EOS>
by
little
and
little
it
come
out
,
that
,
in
the
competition
on
all
point
of
appearance
and
gentility
then
run
high
in
the
Commons
,
he
have
spend
more
than
his
professional
income
,
which
be
not
a
very
large
one
,
and
have
reduce
his
private
mean
,
if
they
ever
have
be
great
(
which
be
exceedingly
doubtful
)
,
to
a
very
low
ebb
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
sale
of
the
furniture
and
lease
,
at
Norwood
;
and
Tiffey
tell
me
,
little
thinking
how
interested
I
be
in
the
story
,
that
,
pay
all
the
just
debt
of
the
deceased
,
and
deduct
his
share
of
outstanding
bad
and
doubtful
debt
due
to
the
firm
,
he
would
not
give
a
thousand
pound
for
all
the
asset
remain
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
at
the
expiration
of
about
six
week
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
suffer
torture
all
the
time
;
and
think
I
really
must
have
lay
violent
hand
upon
myself
,
when
Miss
Mills
still
report
to
me
,
that
my
break
-
hearted
little
Dora
would
say
nothing
,
when
I
be
mention
,
but
"
oh
,
poor
papa
!
 
<EOS>
oh
,
dear
papa
!
"
<EOS>
also
,
that
she
have
no
other
relation
than
two
aunt
,
maiden
sister
of
Mr
Spenlow
,
who
live
at
Putney
,
and
who
have
not
hold
any
other
than
chance
communication
with
their
brother
for
many
year
.
 
<EOS>
not
that
they
have
ever
quarrel
(
Miss
Mills
inform
me
)
;
but
that
have
be
,
on
the
occasion
of
Dora
's
christening
,
invite
to
tea
,
when
they
consider
themselves
privileged
to
be
invite
to
dinner
,
they
have
express
their
opinion
in
writing
,
that
it
be
"
well
for
the
happiness
of
all
party
"
that
they
should
stay
away
.
 
<EOS>
since
which
they
have
go
their
road
,
and
their
brother
have
go
his
.
   
<EOS>
these
two
lady
now
emerge
from
their
retirement
,
and
propose
to
take
Dora
to
live
at
Putney
.
 
<EOS>
Dora
,
cling
to
them
both
,
and
weeping
,
exclaim
,
"
o
yes
,
aunt
!
 
<EOS>
please
take
Julia
Mills
and
me
and
Jip
to
Putney

"
<EOS>
so
they
go
,
very
soon
after
the
funeral
.
   
<EOS>
how
I
find
time
to
haunt
Putney
,
I
be
sure
I
do
not
know
;
but
I
contrive
,
by
some
mean

other
,
to
prowl

pretty
often

<EOS>
Miss
Mills
,
for
the

of
the
duty
of

,
keep
a
journal
;

she
use

on
a
sufficiently
strong

without

,
such
a
blow
as
the
sudden
loss
of
its
active
manager

<EOS>
It
fall
off
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
jorkin
,
notwithstanding
his

an
easy

going

incapable
sort
of
man
,
whose

out

be
not
calculate
to
back
it
up

<EOS>
I
be
turn
over
to
him
now
,
and
when
I
see
him
take
his
snuff
and
let
the
business
go
,
I
regret
my
aunt
's
thousand
pound
more
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
the
bad
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
number
of
hanger

outsider
about
the
Commons

who
,
without

proctor

,
dabble
in
common

and
get
it

real
proctor

who
lend
their
name
in
consideration
of
a
share
in
the
spoil
;
---
and
there
be
a
good
many
of
these
too
.
 
<EOS>
as
our
house
now
want
business
on
any
term

we
join
this
noble
band
;
and
throw
out
lur

the
hanger

outsider
,
to
bring
their
business
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
marriage
licence
and
small
probate
be
what
we
all
look
for
,
and
what
pay
us
best
;
and
the
competition
for
these
run
very
high
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Kidnappers
and
inveigler
be
plant
in
all
the
avenue
of
entrance
to
the
Commons
,
with
instruction
to
do
their
utmost
to
cut
off
all
person
in
mourning
,
and
all
gentleman
with
anything
bashful
in
their
appearance
,
and
entice
them
to
the
office
in
which
their
respective
employer
be
interested
;
which
instruction
be
so
well
observed
,
that
I
myself
,
before
I
be
know
by

,
be
twice
hustle
into
the
premise
of
our
principal
opponent
.
 
<EOS>
the
conflict
interest
of
these

gentleman
be
of
a
nature
to
irritate
their
feeling
,
personal
collision
take
place
;
and
the
Commons
be
even
scandalize
by
our
principal
inveigler
(
who
have
formerly
be
in
the
wine
trade
,
and
afterwards
in
the
swear
brokery
line
)
walk
about
for
some
day
with
a
black
eye
.
 
<EOS>
any
one
of
these
scout
use
to
think
nothing
of
politely
assist
an
old

in
black
out
of
a

kill
any
proctor
whom
she
inquire
for
,
represent
his
employer
as
the
lawful

representative
of
that
proctor
,
and
bear
the
old
lady
off
(
sometimes
greatly
affect
)
to
his

office
.
 
<EOS>
many
captive
be
bring
to
me
in
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
marriage
licence
,
the
competition
rise
to
such
a
pitch
,
that
a
shy
gentleman
in
want
of
one
,
have
nothing
to
do
but
submit
himself
to
the
first
inveigler
,
or
be
fight
for

and
become
the
prey
of
the
strong
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
our
clerk
,
who
be
an
outsider
,
use
,
in
the
height
of
this
contest
,
to
sit
with
his
hat
on
,
that
he
may
be
ready
to
rush
out
and
swear
before
a

any
victim

<EOS>
the
system
of
inveigle
continue

I
believe
,
to
this
day

<EOS>
the
last
time
I

in
the
Commons

pounce
out
upon
me
from
a

,
and
whisper
the

in
my
ear
,
be
with
great
difficulty
prevent

take
me
up
in
his

and
lift
me
into
a
proctor

.
 
<EOS>
from
this
digression
,
let
me
proceed
to
Dover
.
   
<EOS>
I
find
everything
in
a
satisfactory
state
at
the
cottage
;
and
be
enable
to
gratify
my
aunt
exceedingly
by
report
that
the
tenant
inherit
her
feud
,
and
wage
incessant
war
against
donkey
.
<EOS>
have
settle
the
little
business
I
have
to
transact
there
,
and
sleep
there
one
night
,
I
walk
on
to
Canterbury
early
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
now
winter
again
;
and
the
fresh

cold
windy
day
,
and
the

downland
,
brighten
up
my
hope
a
little
.
   
<EOS>
come
into
Canterbury
,
I
loiter
through
the
old
street
with
a
sober
pleasure
that
calm
my
spirit

ease
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
old
sign
,
the
old
name
over
the
shop
,
the
old
people
serve
in
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
appear
so
long
,
since
I
have
be
a
schoolboy
there
,
that
I
wonder
the
place
be
so
little
changed
,
until
I
reflect
how
little
I
be
change
myself
.
 
<EOS>
strange
to
say
,
that
quiet
influence
which
be
inseparable
in
my
mind
from
Agnes
,
seem
to
pervade
even
the
city
where
she
dwell
.
 
<EOS>
the
venerable
cathedral
tower
,
and
the
old
jackdaw
and
rook
whose
airy
voice
make
them
more
retired
than
perfect
silence
would
have
do
;
the
batter
gateway
,
one
stick
full
with
statue
,
long
throw
down
,
and
crumble
away
,
like
the
reverential
pilgrim
who
have
gaze
upon
them
;
the
still
nook
,
where
the
ivie
growth
of
century
creep
over
gable
end

ruin
wall
;
the
ancient
house
,
the
pastoral
landscape
of
field
,
orchard
,
and
garden
;
everywhere
---
on
everything

I
feel
the

serene

thoughtful

soften
spirit

<EOS>
arrive
at
Mr
Wickfield

house

I
find

in
the
little
low
room
on
the

floor

where
Uriah

have
be
of

Mr

his

<EOS>
He

in
a

looking

burly
and
large

in
that
small
office
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
be
extremely
glad
to
see
me
,
but
a
little
confused
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
conduct
me
immediately
into
the
presence
of
Uriah
,
but
I
decline
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know

say
I

he
reply

<EOS>
"
to
a

the

they
involve

He
then
tell
me

that
Mrs

would
be
delighted

once

<EOS>
"
It
be
humble
,
"
say
Mr
Micawber
,
"
---
to
quote
a
favourite
expression
of
my
friend
Heep
;
but
it
may
prove
the
stepping

stone
to
more
ambitious
domiciliary
accommodation
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
ask
him
whether
he
have
reason
,
so
far
,
to
be
satisfied
with
his
friend
<EOS>
Heep
's
treatment
of
him
?
 
<EOS>
He
get
up
to
ascertain
if
the
door
be
close
shut

he
reply
,
in
a
low
voice

all
I
can

that
my

I

in

I

the

I

never

we

well

here

<EOS>
You
come
to
London

I
rely
on
you

I
have
an
object

a
course
at
once

I

drive
out

it

I
come
here

in

moment
I

an
altered
person

<EOS>
the
circumstance
that
distress
me
be
not

,
since
I
come
into
this
room

an
influence
come
over
me
in
that
short
interval
that
alter
me

oh
,
how
much
for
the
well
!
 
<EOS>
what
be
it
?
 
<EOS>
what
be
your
secret

<EOS>
Her

be
bent
down

look
at
the
fire

<EOS>
"
It
be
the
old
story

I.
 
"
do
not
laugh
,
when
I
say
it
be
always
the
same
in
little
thing
as
it
be
in
great
one

<EOS>
My
old
trouble
be
nonsense
,

now
they
be
serious
;

whenever
I
have
go
away
from
my
adopt
sister

look
up

with
such
a
heavenly
face

give
me
her
hand

I

"
whenever
I
have
not
have
you
,
Agnes

to
advise
and
approve
in
the
beginning

I
have
seem
to
go
wild

to
get
into
all
sort
of
difficulty

<EOS>
when
I
have
come
to
you

at
last
(
as
I
have
always
do
)
,
I
have
come
to
peace
and
happiness

<EOS>
I
come
home
,
now

like
a
tired
traveller
,
and
find
such
a
blessed
sense
of
rest
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
feel
so
deeply
what
I

,
it
affect
me
so
sincerely
,
that
my
voice
fail
,
and
I
cover
my
face
with
my
hand

break
into
tear

<EOS>
I
write
the
truth

<EOS>
whatever
contradiction

inconsistency
there
be
within

as
there
be
within
so
many
of
us

whatever
may
have
be
so
different

so
much
well

whatever
I
have
do

in

I
have
perversely
wander
away
from
the
voice

my
own
heart

I
know
nothing
of

<EOS>
I
only
know
that
I
be
fervently
in

when
I
feel
the
rest

peace

Agnes
near

<EOS>
in
her
placid
sisterly
manner

with
her
beam
eye

with
her
tender
voice

with
that
sweet
composure
,
which
have
long
ago
make
the
house
that
hold
her
quite
a
sacred
place
to
me
;
she
soon
win
me
from
this
weakness

lead
me
on
to
tell
all
that
have
happen
since
our
last
meeting

<EOS>

there
be
not

I
,
when
I
have
make
an
end
of

with

<EOS>
"
It

on
Dora

I.
   
<EOS>
"
assuredly

"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
have
not
mention
,
Agnes

I
,
a
little
embarrassed

that
Dora
be
rather
difficult
to
---
<EOS>
I
would
not

for
the
world

say
,
to
rely
upon
,
because
she
be
the
soul
of
purity

truth

rather
difficult
to
---
I
hardly
know
how
to
express
it
,
really
,
Agnes
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
timid
little
thing
,
and
easily
disturb
and
frightened
.
 
<EOS>
some
time
ago
,
before
her
father
's
death
,
when
I
think
it
right
to
mention
to
her
---
but
I
will
tell
you
,
if
you
will
bear
with
me
,
how
it
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
accordingly
,
I
tell
agne
about
my
declaration
of
poverty
,
about
the
cookery
-
book
,
the
housekeeping
account
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Trotwood
!

"
<EOS>
she
remonstrate

with
a
smile

<EOS>
"
just
your
old
headlong
way
!
 
<EOS>
You
may
have
be
in
earnest

strive
to
get
on
in
the
world
,
without
be
so
very
sudden
with
a
timid
,
loving
,
inexperienced
girl
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Dora
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
never
hear
such
sweet
forbear
kindness
express
in
a
voice
,
as
she
express
in
make
this
reply
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
I
have
see
her
admiringly
and
tenderly
embrace
Dora
,
and
tacitly
reprove
me
,
by
her
considerate
protection
,
for
my
hot
haste
in
flutter
that
little
heart
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
I
have
see
Dora
,
in
all
her
fascinating
artlessness
,
caress
agne
,
and
thank
her
,
and
coaxingly
appeal
against
me
,
and
love
me
with
all
her
childish
innocence
.
   
<EOS>
I
feel
so
grateful
to
Agnes
,
and
admire
her
so
!
 
<EOS>
I
see
those
two
together
,
in
a
bright
perspective
,
<EOS>
such
well
-
associate
friend
,
each
adorn
the
other
so
much
!
   
<EOS>
"
what
ought
I
to
do
then
,
Agnes
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
,
after
look
at
the
fire
a
little
while
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
would
it
be
right
to
do
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
say
Agnes
,
"
that
the
honourable
course
to
take
,
would
be
to
write
to
those
two
lady
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
that
any
secret
course
be
an
unworthy
one
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
think
so
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
poorly
qualified
to
judge
of
such
matter
,
"
reply
agne
,
with
a
modest
hesitation
,
"
but
I
certainly
feel
---
in
short
<EOS>
,
I
feel
that
your
be
secret
and
clandestine
,
be
not
be
like
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
like
myself
,
in
the
too
high
opinion
you
have
of
me
,
Agnes
,
I
be
afraid
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
like
yourself
,
in
the
candour
of
your
nature
,
"
she
return
;
"
and
therefore
I
would
write
to
those
two
lady
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
relate
,
as
plainly
and
as
openly
as
possible
,
all
that
have
take
place
;
and
I
would
ask
their
permission
to
visit
sometimes
,
at
their
house
.
<EOS>
consider
that
you
be
young
,
and
strive
for
a
place
in
life
,
I
think
it
would
be
well
to
say
that
you
would
readily
abide
by
any
condition
they
may
impose
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
entreat
them
not
to
dismiss
your
request
,
without
a
reference
to
Dora
;
and
to
discuss
it
with
her
when
they
should
think
the
time
suitable
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
be
too
vehement
,
"
say
agne
,
gently
,
"
or
propose
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
trust
to
my
fidelity
and
perseverance
---
and
to
Dora
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
but
if
they
be
to
frighten
Dora
again
,
Agnes
,
by
speak
to
her
,
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
and
if
Dora
be
to
cry
,
and
say
nothing
about
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
be
that
likely
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
Agnes
,
with
the
same
sweet
consideration
in
her
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
God
bless
her
,
she
be
as
easily
scare
as
a
bird
,
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
!
 
<EOS>
or
if
the
two
Miss
Spenlows
(
elderly
lady
of
that
sort
be
odd
character
sometimes
)
should
not
be
likely
person
to
address
in
that
way
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
,
Trotwood
,
"
return
Agnes
,
raise
her
soft
eye
to
mine
,
"
I
would
consider
that
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
it
would
be
well
only
to
consider
whether
it
be
right
to
do
this
;
and
,
if
it
be
,
to
do
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
have
no
longer
any
doubt
on
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
with
a
lighten
heart
,
though
with
a
profound
sense
of
the
weighty
importance
of
my
task
,
I
devote
the
whole
afternoon
to
the
composition
of
the
draft
of
this
letter
;
for
which
great
purpose
,
Agnes
relinquish
her
desk
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
first
I
go
downstairs
to
see
Mr
Wickfield
and
Uriah
Heep
.
   
<EOS>
I
find
Uriah
in
possession
of
a
new
,
plaster
-
smell
office
,
build
out
in
the
garden
;
look
extraordinarily
mean
,
in
the
midst
of
a
quantity
of
book
and
paper
.
 
<EOS>
He
receive
me
in
his
usual
fawning
way
,
and
pretend
not
to
have
hear
of
my
arrival
from
Mr
Micawber
;
a
pretence
I
take
the
liberty
of
disbelieve
.
 
<EOS>
He
accompany
me
into
Mr
Wickfield
's
room
,
which
be
the
shadow
of
its
former
self
---
have
be
divest
of
a
variety
of
convenience
,
for
the
accommodation
of
the
new
partner
---
and
stand
before
the
fire
,
warm
his
back
,
and
shave
his
chin
with
his
bony
hand
,
while
Mr
Wickfield
<EOS>
and
I
exchange
greeting
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
stay
with
us
,
Trotwood
,
while
you
remain
in
Canterbury
?
"
say
Mr
Wickfield
,
not
without
a
glance
at
Uriah
for
his
approval
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
there
room
for
me
?
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
,
Master
Copperfield
---
I
should
say
Mister
,
but
the
other
come
so
natural
,
"
say
Uriah
,
---
<EOS>
"
I
would
turn
out
of
your
old
room
with
pleasure
,
if
it
would
be
agreeable
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
Mr
Wickfield
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
should
you
be
inconvenience
?
<EOS>
there
be
another
room
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
another
room
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
but
you
know
,
"
return
Uriah
,
with
a
grin
,
"
I
should
really
be
delighted
!
"
   
<EOS>
to
cut
the
matter
short
,
I
say
I
would
have
the
other
room
or
none
at
all
;
so
it
be
settle
that
I
should
have
the
other
room
;
and
,
take
my
leave
of
the
firm
until
dinner
<EOS>
,
I
go
upstairs
again
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
hope
to
have
no
other
companion
than
Agnes
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mrs
Heep
have
ask
permission
to
bring
herself
and
her
knit
near
the
fire
,
in
that
room
;
on
pretence
of
its
have
an
aspect
more
favourable
for
her
rheumatic
,
as
the
wind
then
be
,
than
the
drawing
-
room
or
dining
-
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
though
I
could
almost
have
consign
her
to
the
mercy
of
the
wind
on
the
topmost
pinnacle
of
the
Cathedral
,
without
remorse
,
I
make
a
virtue
of
necessity
,
and
give
her
a
friendly
salutation
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
umbly
thankful
to
you
,
sir
,
"
say
Mrs
Heep
,
in
acknowledgement
of
my
inquiry
concern
her
health
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
be
only
pretty
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
much
to
boast
of
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
could
see
my
Uriah
well
settle
in
life
,
I
could
not
expect
much
more
I
think
.
<EOS>
how
do
you
think
my
Ury
looking
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
think
him
look
as
villainous
as
ever
,
and
I
reply
that
I
see
no
change
in
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
do
not
you
think
he
be
change
?
"
say
Mrs
Heep
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
I
must
umbly
beg
leave
to
differ
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
see
a
thinness
in
him
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
not
more
than
usual
,
"
I
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
though
!
"
say
Mrs
Heep
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
you
do
not
take
notice
of
him
with
a
mother
's
eye
!
"
   
<EOS>
His
mother
's
eye
be
an
evil
eye
to
the
rest
of
the
world
<EOS>
,
I
think
as
it
meet
mine
,
howsoever
affectionate
to
him
;
and
I
believe
she
and
her
son
be
devote
to
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
It
pass
me
,
and
go
on
to
Agnes
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
see
a
wasting
and
a
wear
in
him
,
Miss
Wickfield
?
"
inquire
Mrs
Heep
.
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Agnes
,
quietly
pursue
the
work
on
which
she
be
engage
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
too
solicitous
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
well
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Heep
,
with
a
prodigious
sniff
,
resume
her
knitting
.
   
<EOS>
She
never
leave
off
,
or
leave
us
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
arrive
early
in
the
day
,
and
we
have
still
three
or
four
hour
before
dinner
;
but
she
sit
there
,
ply
her
knitting
-
needle
as
monotonously
as
an
hour
-
glass
may
have
pour
out
its
sand
.
 
<EOS>
She
sit
on
one
side
of
the
fire
;
I
sit
at
the
desk
in
front
of
it
;
a
little
beyond
me
,
on
the
other
side
,
sit
Agnes
.
 
<EOS>
whensoever
,
slowly
ponder
over
my
letter
,
I
lift
up
my
eye
,
and
meet
the
thoughtful
face
of
agne
,
see
it
clear
,
and
beam
encouragement
upon
me
,
with
its
own
angelic
expression
,
I
be
conscious
presently
of
the
evil
eye
pass
me
,
and
go
on
to
her
,
and
come
back
to
me
again
,
and
drop
furtively
upon
the
knitting
.
 
<EOS>
what
the
knitting
be
,
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
,
not
be
learn
in
that
art
;
but
it
look
like
a
net
;
and
as
she
work
away
with
those
chinese
chopstick
of
knitting
-
needle
,
she
show
in
the
firelight
like
an
ill
-
look
enchantress
,
baulk
as
yet
by
the
radiant
goodness
opposite
,
but
get
ready
for
a
cast
of
her
net
by
and
by
.
   
<EOS>
at
dinner
she
maintain
her
watch
,
with
the
same
unwinking
eye
.
<EOS>
after
dinner
,
her
son
take
his
turn
;
and
when
Mr
Wickfield
,
himself
,
and
I
be
leave
alone
together
,
leer
at
me
,
and
writhe
until
I
could
hardly
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
drawing

room
,
there
be
the
mother
knit
and
watch
again

<EOS>
all
the
time
that
Agnes
sing

the

sit
at
the
piano
.
 
<EOS>
once
she
ask
for
a
particular
ballad
,
which
she
say
her
Ury
(
who
be
yawn
in
a
great
chair
)
dote
on
;
and
at
interval
she
look
round
at
him
,
and
report
to
agne
that
he
be
in
rapture
with
the
music
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
hardly
ever
speak
<EOS>
---
I
question
if
she
ever
do
---
without
make
some
mention
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
evident
to
me
that
this
be
the
duty
assign
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
this
last
until
bedtime
.
 
<EOS>
to
have
see
the
mother
and
son
,
like
two
great
bat
hang
over
the
whole
house
,
and
darken
it
with
their
ugly
form
,
make
me
so
uncomfortable
,
that
I
would
rather
have
remain
downstairs
,
knit
and
all
,
than
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
hardly
get
any
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
the
knitting
and
watch
begin
again
,
and
last
all
day
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
not
an
opportunity
of
speak
to
Agnes
,
for
ten
minute
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
barely
show
her
my
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
propose
to
her
to
walk
out
with
me
;
but
Mrs
Heep
repeatedly
complain
that
she
be
bad
,
Agnes
charitably
remain
within
,
to
bear
her
company
.
 
<EOS>
towards
the
twilight
I
go
out
by
myself
,
muse
on
what
I
ought
to
do
,
and
whether
I
be
justified
in
withhold
from
Agnes
,
any
longer
,
what
Uriah
Heep
have
tell
me
in
London
;
for
that
begin
to
trouble
me
again
,
very
much
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
not
walk
out
far
enough
to
be
quite
clear
of
the
town
,
upon
the
Ramsgate
road
,
where
there
be
a
good
path
,
when
I
be
hail
,
through
the
dust
,
by
somebody
behind
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
shambling
figure
,
and
the
scanty
great
-
coat
,
be
not
to
be
mistake
.
 
<EOS>
I
stop
,
and
Uriah
Heep
come
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
?
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
how
fast
you
walk
!
"
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
leg
be
pretty
long
,
but
you
have
give
'em
quite
a
job
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
where
be
you
go
?
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
with
you
,
Master
Copperfield
,
if
you
will
allow
me
the
pleasure
of
a
walk
with
an
old
acquaintance
.
"
 
<EOS>
say
this
,
with
a
jerk
of
his
body
,
which
may
have
be
either
propitiatory
or
derisive
,
he
fall
into
step
beside
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
Uriah
!
<EOS>
"
say
I
,
as
civilly
as
I
could
,
after
a
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Master
Copperfield
!
"
say
Uriah
.
   
<EOS>
"
to
tell
you
the
truth
(
at
which
you
will
not
be
offend
)
,
I
come
out
to
walk
alone
,
because
I
have
have
so
much
company
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
look
at
me
sideways
,
and
say
with
his
hard
grin
,
"
You
mean
mother
.

"
   
<EOS>
"
why
yes
,
I
do
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
!
 
<EOS>
but
you
know
we
be
so
very
umble

he
return
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
have
such
a
knowledge
of
our
own
umbleness

must
really
take
care

the

<EOS>
raise
his
great
hand
until
they
touch
his
chin
,
he
rub
them
softly
,
and
softly
chuckle
;
look
as
like
a
malevolent
baboon
,
I
think
,
as
anything
human
could
look
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
he
say
,
still
hug
himself
in
that
unpleasant
way
,
and
shake
his
head
at
me
,

dangerous
rival

anything

do

Father

of
umbleness

not

else
that
I
know

from

We

have
the
character

ever
occur

that
this
detestable
can

I

"
when
I

I
get
to

do

take
to
it

I
eat
umble
pie
with
an
appetite

I
stop
at

I

umble
to

Master

I
have
get
a
little
power

<EOS>
and
he
say
all
this
---
I
know
,
as
I
see
his
face
in
the
moonlight

that
I
may
understand
he
be
resolve
to
recompense
himself
by
use
his
power
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
doubt
his
meanness
,
his
craft
and
malice
;
but
I
fully
comprehend
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
what
a
base
,
unrelenting
,
and
revengeful
spirit
,
must
have
be
engender
by
this
early
,
and
this
long
,
suppression
.
   
<EOS>
His
account
of
himself
be
so
far
attend
with
an
agreeable
result
,
that
it
lead
to
his
withdraw
his
hand
in
order
that
he
may
have
another
hug
of
himself
under
the
chin
.
 
<EOS>
once
apart
from
him
,
I
be
determined
to
keep
apart
;
and
we
walk
back
,
side
by
side
,
say
very
little
more
by
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
whether
his
spirit
be
elevate
by
the
communication
I
have
make
to
him
,
or
by
his
have
indulge
in
this
retrospect
,
I
do
not
know
;
but
they
be
raise
by
some
influence
.
 
<EOS>
He
talk
more
at
dinner
than
be
usual
with
him
;
ask
his
mother
(
off
duty
,
from
the
moment
of
our
re
-
enter
the
house
)
whether
he
be
not
grow
too
old
for
a
bachelor
;
and
once
look
at
agne
so
,
that
I
would
have
give
all
I
have
,
for
leave
to
knock
him
down
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
three
male
be
leave
alone
after
dinner
,
he
get
into
a
more
adventurous
state
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
take
little
or
no
wine
;
and
I
presume
it
be
the
mere
insolence
of
triumph
that
be
upon
him
,
flush
perhaps
by
the
temptation
my
presence
furnish
to
its
exhibition
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
observe
yesterday
,
that
he
try
to
entice
Mr
Wickfield
to
drink
;
and
,
interpret
the
look
which
Agnes
have
give
me
as
she
go
out
,
have
limit
myself
to
one
glass
,
and
then
propose
that
we
should
follow
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
do
so
again
today
;
but
Uriah
be
too
quick
for
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
seldom
see
our

visitor

he
say
,
address
Mr
Wickfield
,
sitting
,
such
a
contrast
to
him
,
at
the
end
of
the
table
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
should
propose
to
give
him
welcome
in
another
glass

two
of
wine
,
if
you
have
no
objection

I
be
oblige
to
make
a
show
of
take
the
hand
he
stretch
across
to
me
;
and
then
,
with
very
different
emotion
,
I
take
the
hand
of
the
broken
gentleman

his
partner

<EOS>

ineffectual
effort
that
he
make
against
it
;
the
struggle
between
his
shame
in
Uriah
's
deportment
,
and
his
desire
to
conciliate
him
;
the
manif
exultation
with
which
Uriah
twist
and
turn
,
and
hold
him
up
before
me

It
make
me
sick
at
heart
to
see

my

recoil
from

come

Uriah

at

I
will
give
you
another

down

adore

no

her

grey
head
could
have
bear

I
think

could

the

I
see
compress
now
within
both
his

speak
out

"
   
<EOS>
I
have
<EOS>
my
arm
round
Mr
Wickfield
,
implore
him
by
everything
that
I
could
think
of
,
oftenest
of
all
by
his
love
for
agne
,
to
calm
himself
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
mad
for
the
moment
;
tear
out
his
hair
,
beat
his
head
,
try
to
force
me
from
him
,
and
to
force
himself
from
me
,
not
answer
a
word
,
not
look
at
or
see
anyone
;
blindly
strive
for
<EOS>
he
know
not
what
,
his
face
all
stare
and
distort
---
a
frightful
spectacle
.
   
<EOS>
I
conjure
him
,
incoherently
,
but
in
the
most
impassioned
manner
,
not
to
abandon
himself
to
this
wildness
,
but
to
hear
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
besought
him
to
think
of
Agnes
,
to
connect
me
with
agne
,
to
recollect
how
Agnes
and
I
have
grow
up
together
<EOS>
,
how
I
honour
her
and
love
her
<EOS>
,
how
she
be
his
pride
and
joy
.
 
<EOS>
I
try
to
bring
her
idea
before
him
in
any
form
;
I
even
reproach
him
with
not
have
firmness
to
spare
her
the
knowledge
of
such
a
scene
as
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
effect
something
,
or
his
wildness
may
have
spend
itself
;
but
by
degree
he
struggle
less
,
and
begin
to
look
at
me
---
strangely
at
first
,
then
with
recognition
in
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
he
say
,
"

point
to

pale

glower
in

evidently
very
much
out
in

take
by

just
break

struggle
up

after

oblige
myself
to
say

I
be
glad

have
make
his
apology

Profuse
in
his
farewell
<EOS>
,
he
get
down
again
as
the
coachman
get
up

<EOS>
for
anything
I
know
,
he
be
eat
something
to
keep
the
raw
morning
air
out

he
make
motion
with
his
mouth
as

the
pear

ripe

and
he
be
smack
his
lip
over

very
serious
conversation
in
Buckingham
Street
that
night
,
about
the
domestic
occurrence
I
have
detail
in
the
last
chapter
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
be
deeply
interested
in
them
,
and
walk
up
and
down
the
room
with
her
arm
fold
,
for
more
than
two
hour
afterwards
.
<EOS>
whenever
she
be
particularly
discompose
,
she
always
perform
one
of
these
pedestrian
feat
;
and
the
amount
of
her
discomposure
may
always
be
estimate
by
the
duration
of
her
walk
.
 
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
she
be
so
much
disturb
in
mind
as
to
find
it
necessary
to
open
the
bedroom
door
,
and
make
a
course
for
herself
,
comprise
the
full
extent
of
the
bedroom
from
wall
to
wall
;
and
while
Mr
Dick
and
I
sit
quietly
by
the
fire
,
she
keep
pass
in
and
out
,
along
this
measure
track
,
at
an
unchanging
pace
,
with
the
regularity
of
a
clock
-
pendulum
.
   
<EOS>
when
my
aunt
and
I
be
leave
to
ourselves
by
Mr
Dick
's
go
out
to
bed
,
I
sit
down
to
write
my
letter
to
the
two
old
lady
.
 
<EOS>
by
that
time
she
be
tired
of
walk
,
and
sit
by
the
fire
with
her
dress
tuck
up
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
but
instead
of
sit
in
her
usual
manner
,
hold
her
glass
upon
her
knee
,
she
suffer
it
to
stand
neglect
on
the
chimney
-
piece
;
and
,
rest
her
left
elbow
on
her
right
arm
,
and
her
chin
on
her
left
hand
,
look
thoughtfully
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
as
often
as
I
raise
my
eye
from
what
I
be
about
,
I
meet
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
in
the
loving
of
temper
,
my
dear
,
"
she
would
assure
me
with
a
nod
,
"
but
I
be
fidget
and
sorry
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
have
be
too
busy
to
observe
,
until
after
she
be
go
to
bed
,
that
she
have
leave
her
night
-
mixture
,
as
she
always
call
it
,
untaste
on
the
chimney
-
piece
.
 
<EOS>
She
come
to
her
door
,
with
even
more
than
her
usual
affection
of
manner
,
when
I
knock
to
acquaint
her
with
this
discovery
;
but
only
say
,
"
I
have
not
the
heart
to
take
it
,
Trot
,
tonight
,
"
and
shake
her
head
,
and
go
in
again
.
   
<EOS>
She
read
my
letter
to
the
two
old
lady
,
in
the
morning
,
and
approve
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
post
it
,
and
have
nothing
to
do
then
,
but
wait
,
as
patiently
as
I
could
,
for
the
reply
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
still
in
this
state
of
expectation
,
and
have
be
,
for
nearly
a
week
;
when
I
leave
the
Doctor
's
one
snowy
night
,
to
walk
home
.
   
<EOS>
It
have
be
a
bitter
day
,
and
a
cut
north
-
east
wind
have
blow
for
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
the
wind
have
go
down
with
the
light
,
and
so
the
snow
have
come
on
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
heavy
,
settle
fall
,
I
recollect
,
in
great
flake
;
and
it
lie
thick
.
 
<EOS>
the
noise
of
wheel
and
tread
of
people
be
as
hush
,
as
if
the
street
have
be
strew
that
depth
with
feather
.
   
<EOS>
My
short
way
home
,
---
and
I
naturally
take
the
short
way
on
such
a
night
---
be
through
St
Martin
's
Lane
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
the
church
which
give
its
name
to
the
lane
,
stand
in
a
less
free
situation
at
that
time
;
there
be
no
open
space
before
it
,
and
the
lane
wind
down
to
the
Strand
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
pass
the
step
of
the
portico
,
I
encounter
,
at
the
corner
,
a
woman
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
It
look
in
mine
,
pass
across
the
narrow
lane
,
and
disappear
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
it
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
remember
where
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
some
association
with
it
,
that
strike
upon
my
heart
directly
;
but
I
be
think
of
anything
else
when
it
come
upon
me
,
and
be
confused
.
   
<EOS>
on
the
step
of
the
church
,
there
be
the
stooping
figure
of
a
man
,
who
have
put
down
some
burden
on
the
smooth
snow
,
to
adjust
it
;
my
see
the
face
,
and
my
see
him
,
be
simultaneous
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
I
have
stop
in
my
surprise
;
but
,
in
any
case
,
as
I
go
on
,
he
rise
,
turn
,
and
come
down
towards
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
stand
face
to
face
with
Mr
Peggotty
!
   
<EOS>
then
I
remember
the
woman
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Martha
,
to
whom
Emily
have
give
the
money
that
night
in
the
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
Martha
Endell
---

by
side
with
whom
,
he
would
not
have
see
his
dear
niece
<EOS>
,
Ham
have
tell
me
,
for
all
the
treasure
wreck
in
the
sea
.
   
<EOS>
We
shake
hand
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
,
neither

shake
the
snow
out
of
his
long
hair
,
"
I
be
a

go
to
turn
in
somewheer
.
"
   
<EOS>
in
those
day
there
be
a
side
-
entrance
to
the
stable
-
yard
of
the
Golden
Cross
,
the
inn
<EOS>
so
memorable
to
me
in
connexion
with
his
misfortune
,
nearly
opposite
to
where
we
stand
.
 
<EOS>
I
point
out
the
gateway
,
put
my
arm
through
his
,
and
we
go
across
.
 
<EOS>
two
or
three
public
-
room
open
out
of
the
stable
-
yard
;
and
look
into
one
of
them
,
and
find
it
empty
,
and
a
good
fire
burning
,
I
take
him
in
there
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
see
him
in
the
light
,
I
observe
,
not
only
that
his
hair
be
long
and
ragged
,
but
that
his
face
be
burn
dark
by
the
sun
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
greyer
,
the
line
in
his
face
and
forehead
be
deep
,
and
he
have
every
appearance
of
have
toil
and
wander
through
all
variety
of
weather
;
but
he
look
very
strong
,
and
like
a
man
uphold
by
steadfastness
of
purpose
,
whom
nothing
could
tire
out
.
<EOS>
He
shake
the
snow
from
his
hat
and
clothe
,
and
brush
it
away
from
his
face
,
while
I
be
inwardly
make
these
remark
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
sit
down
opposite
to
me
at
a
table
,
with
his
back
to
the
door
by
which
we
have
enter
,
he
put
out
his
rough
hand
again
,
and
grasp
mine
warmly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
he
say
,
---
"
<EOS>
wheer
all

<EOS>
I

and
we
have
heerd
little
;
but
I
will
tell
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
ring
the
bell
for
something
hot
to
drink
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
nothing
strong
than
ale
;
and
while
it
be
be
bring
,
and
be
warm
at
the
fire
,
he
sit
think
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
fine
,
massive
gravity
in
his
face
,
I
do
not
venture
to
disturb
.
   
<EOS>
"
when
she

"
he
say
,
lift
up
his
head
soon
after
we
be
leave
alone
,
"

to
talk
to
me
a
deal
about
the
sea
,
and
about

coast
where
the
sea
get
to
be
dark
blue
,
and
to
lay
a

shining
and
a

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
odd
time
,
as

think
on
it
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
doen't

<EOS>
but
maybe

or
hope
---

drift
out
to

part
,
where
the
flower
be
always
a

blowing
,
and
the
country
bright
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
likely
to
have
be
a
childish
fancy
,
"
I
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
when
she
be
---
lose
,
"
say
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
I
know'd
<EOS>
in
my
mind
,
as
he
would
take
her
to
them
country
.
 
<EOS>
I
know'd
<EOS>
in
my
mind
,
as
he
would
have
tell
her
wonder
of
'em
,
and
how
she
be
to

theer
,
and
how

<EOS>
when
we
see
his

I
know'd
<EOS>

<EOS>
I
go
across

channel
to
France
,
and
land
theer
,
as
if
I
would
fall
down
from
the
sky
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
see
the
door
move
,
and
the
snow
drift
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
it
move
a
little
more
,
and
a
hand
softly
interpose
to
keep
it
open
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
find

<EOS>
I

for

!
 
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
I
could
not
talk
to
him

"
say
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
nor

;
but
we
be
company
for
one
another
,
too
,
along
the
dusty
road
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
should
have
know
that
by
his
friendly
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
when
I
come
to
any
town

"
I
find
the
inn
,
and
wait
about
the
yard
till
someone
turn
up
(
someone
mostly
do
)
as
know'd
English
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
tell
how
that
I
be
on
my
way
to
seek
my
niece
,
and
they
tell
me
what
manner
of
gentlefolks
be
in
the
house

and
I
wait
to
see
any
as
seem
like

go
in

<EOS>
when
it
warn't
Em'ly

<EOS>
by
little
and
little
,
when
I
come
to
a
new
village
or
that
,
among
the
poor
people
,
I
find
they
know'd
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
set
me
down
at
their
cottage
door
,
and
give
me
what
-
not
fur
to
eat
and
drink
,
and
show
me
where
to

;
and
many
a
woman

<EOS>
and
God

"
   
<EOS>
It
be
Martha
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
her
haggard
,
listen
face
distinctly
.
 
<EOS>
My
dread
be
lest
he
should
turn
his
head
,
and
see
her
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
would
often
put
their
child

particular
their
little
girl
,
"
say
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
upon
my
knee
;
and
many
a
time
you
may
have
see
me
sit
at
their
door
,
when
night
be
come
in
,
a'most
as
if
they
would
be
my
Darling
's
child
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
my
darling
!
"
   
<EOS>
overpower
by
sudden
grief
,
he
sob
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
I
lay
my
tremble
hand
upon
the
hand
he
put
before
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thankee
,
sir
,
"
he
say
,
"
doen't
take
no
notice
.
"
   
<EOS>
in
a
very
little
while
he
take
his
hand
away
and
put
it
on
his
breast
,
and
go
on
with
his
story
.
<EOS>
"
They
often
walk
with
me
,
"
he
say
,
"
in
the
morning
,
maybe
a
mile
or
two
upon
my
road
;
and
when
we
part
,
and
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
I
be
very
thankful
to
you
!
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
!
"
<EOS>
they
always
seem
to
understand
,
and
answer
pleasant
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
I
come
to
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
It
warn't
<EOS>
hard
,
you
may
suppose
,
for
a
seafare
man
like
me
to
work
his
way
over
to
Italy
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
get
theer
,
I
wander
on
as
I
have
do
afore
.
<EOS>
the
people
be
just
as
good
to
me
,
and
I
should
have
go
from
town
to
town
,
maybe
the
country
through
,
but
that
I
get
news
of
her

an

use
they
have
make
of
it

the

because

observe
that
conventional

be
a
sort

firework

off

great
variety
of
shape

colour

them
the
favour
to
call
,
upon
a
certain
day
(
accompany
,
if
he
think
proper
,
by
a
confidential
friend
)
,
they
would
be
happy
to
hold
some
conversation
on
the
subject
.
   
<EOS>
to
this
favour
,
Mr
Copperfield
immediately
reply
,
with
his
respectful
compliment
,
that
he
would
have
the
honour
of
wait
on
the
Misses
Spenlow
,
at
the
time
appoint
;
accompany
,
in
accordance
with
their
kind
permission
,
by
his
friend
Mr
Thomas
Traddles
of
the
Inner
Temple
.
 
<EOS>
have
dispatch
which
missive
,
Mr
Copperfield
fall
into
a
condition
of
strong
nervous
agitation
;
and
so
remain
until
the
day
arrive
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
augmentation
of
my
uneasiness
to
be
bereave
,
at
this
eventful
crisis
,
of
the
inestimable
service
of
Miss
Mills
.
<EOS>
but
Mr
Mills
,
who
be
always
do
something
or
other
to
annoy
me
---
or
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
he
be
,
which
be
the
same
thing
---
have
bring
his
conduct
to
a
climax
,
by
take
it
into
his
head
that
he
would
go
to
India
.
 
<EOS>
why
should
he
go
to
India
,
except
to
harass
me
?
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
he
have
nothing
to
do
with
any
other
part
of
the
world
,
and
have
a
good
deal
to
do
with
that
part
;
be
entirely
in
the
India
trade
,
<EOS>
whatever
that
be
(
I
have
float
dream
myself
concern
golden
shawl
and
elephant
'
tooth
)
;
have
be
at
Calcutta
in
his
youth
;
and
design
now
to
go
out
there
again
,
in
the
capacity
of
resident
partner
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
nothing
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
so
much
to
him
that
for
India
he
be
bind
,
and
Julia
with
him
;
and
Julia
go
into
the
country
to
take
leave
of
her
relation
;
and
the
house
be
put
into
a
perfect
suit
of
bill
,
announce
that
it
be
to
be
let
or
sell
,
and
that
the
furniture
(
Mangle
and
all
)
be
to
be
take
at
a
valuation
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
here
be
another
earthquake
of
which
I
become
the
sport
,
before
I
have
recover
from
the
shock
of
its
predecessor
!
   
<EOS>
I
be
in
several
mind
how
to
dress
myself
on
the
important
day
;
be
divide
between
my
desire
to
appear
to
advantage
,
and
my
apprehension
of
put
on
anything
that
may
impair
my
severely
practical
character
in
the
eye
of
the
Misses
Spenlow
.
 
<EOS>
I
endeavour
to
hit
a
happy
medium
between
these
two
extreme
;
my
aunt
approve
the
result
;
and
Mr
Dick
throw
one
of
his
shoe
after
Traddles
and
me
,
for
luck
,
as
we
go
downstairs
.
   
<EOS>
excellent
fellow
as
I
know
traddle
to
be
,
and
warmly
attach
to
him
as
I
be
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
help
wish
,
on
that
delicate
occasion
,
that
he
have
never
contract
the
habit
of
brush
his
hair
so
very
upright
.
 
<EOS>
It
give
him
a
surprised
look
---
not
to
say
a
hearth
-
broomy
kind
of
expression
---
which
,
my
apprehension
whisper
,
may
be
fatal
to
us
.
   
<EOS>
I
take
the
liberty
of
mention
it
to
Traddles
,
as
we
be
walk
to
Putney
;
and
say
that
if
he
WOULD
smooth
it
down
a
little
---
   
"
My
dear
copperfield
,
"
say
Traddles
,
lift
off
his
hat
,
and
rub
his
hair
all
kind
of
way
,
"
nothing
would
give
me
great
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
will
not
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
will
not
be
smooth
down
?
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
nothing
will
induce
it
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
be
to
carry
a
half
-
hundred
-
weight
upon
it
,
all
the
way
to
Putney
,
it
would
be
up
again
the
moment
the
weight
be
take
off
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
no
idea
what
obstinate
hair
mine
be
,
<EOS>
Copperfield
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
quite
a
fretful
porcupine
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
a
little
disappointed
,
I
must
confess
,
but
thoroughly
charm
by
his
good
-
nature
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
how
I
esteem
his
good
-
nature
;
and
say
that
his
hair
must
have
take
all
the
obstinacy
out
of
his
character
,
for
he
have
none
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
"
return
Traddles
,
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
it
be
quite
an
old
story
,
my
unfortunate
hair
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
's
wife
could
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
She
say
it
exasperate
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
stand
very
much
in
my
way
,
too
,
when
I
first
fall
in
love
with
Sophy

<EOS>
very
much
!

<EOS>

do
she

her

I

I.
   
<EOS>
"
yes

with
perfect
innocence

it
be
a
joke
for
us

<EOS>
They
pretend
that
Sophy
have
a
lock
of
it
in
her
desk
,
and
be
oblige
to
shut
it
in
a
clasped
book

down

We
laugh
about
it

by

I
,
"
your

may
suggest
something

<EOS>
when
you
become
engaged

just
mention

do
you
make
a

her

anything

I

nervously

<EOS>
"
why

traddle
,
on
whose
attentive
face
a
thoughtful
shade
have
steal
,
"
it
be
rather
a
painful
transaction

Copperfield
,
in
my
case
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
,
Sophy
be
of
so
much
use
in
the
family
,
none
of
them
could
endure
the
thought
of
her
ever
be
marry
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
they
have
quite
settle
among
themselves
that
she
never
be
to
be
marry
,
and
they
call
her
the
old
maid
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
when
I
mention
it
,
with
the
great
precaution
,
to
Mrs
Crewler

the

the
effect

such
that
she

He
be

excellent

most
exemplary

point
out

to
reconcile

uncertain

bear
no

as
to
myself

Copperfield

I
give
you
my
word

I

a
perfect

<EOS>
"
when
we
have
comparatively
reconcile
Mrs
Crewler
to
it

we
have
to
break
it
to
Sarah

You
recollect
my

Sarah

as
the
one

have
something
the

She

both

at
me
in
dismay

shut
her

She

very
charming

she

a
great
deal

feeling

<EOS>
in

they
all
have

<EOS>
Sophy
tell
me
afterwards
,
that
the
self

reproach
she
undergo
while
she
be
in
attendance
upon
Sarah
,
no
word
could
describe

<EOS>
I
know
it
must
have
be
severe
,
by
my
own
feeling
,
Copperfield
;
which
be
like
a
criminal
's
.
 
<EOS>
after
Sarah
be
restore
,
we
still
have
to
break
it
to
the
other
eight

it
produce
various
effect
upon

a
most
pathetic
nature

doubtfully

the
fact

we
avoid

my
unsettled
prospect

indifferent
circumstance
be
a

consolation

there
will
be
a
deplorable
scene

His
honest
face

as
he
look
at
me
with
a
serio
-
comic
shake
of
his
head
,
impress
me
more
in
the
remembrance
than
it
do
in
the
reality

for
I
be
by
this
time
in
a
state
of
such
excessive
trepidation
and
wandering
of
mind
,
as
to
be
quite
unable
to
fix
my
attention
on
anything

<EOS>
on
our
approach
the
house

the
Misses
Spenlow
live

I
be
at
such
a
discount
in
respect
of
my
personal
look

presence
of
mind

that
Traddles
propose
a
gentle
stimulant
in
the
form
of
a
glass
of
ale

this
have
be

with
totter
step
,
to
the
Misses

door

I
have
a
vague
sensation
of
be
,
as
it
be
,
on
view
,
when
the
maid
open
it
;
and
of
wavering
,
somehow
,
across
a
hall
with
a
weather
-
glass
in
it
,
into
a
quiet
little
drawing
-
room
on
the
ground
-
floor
,
command
a
neat
garden
.
 
<EOS>
also
of
sit
down
here
,
on
a
sofa
,
and
see
Traddles
's
hair
start
up
,
now
his
hat
be
remove
,
like
one
of
those
obtrusive
little
figure
make
of
spring
,
that
fly
out
of
fictitious
snuff
-
box
when
the
lid
be
take
off

<EOS>
also
of
hear
an
old

fashioned
clock
tick
away
on
the
chimney

piece
,
and
try
to
make
it
keep
time
to
the
jerking
of
my

it
would
not

<EOS>
also
of
look
round
the
room
for
any
sign

see
none

also
of
think
that
Jip
once
bark
in

be
instantly
choke
by
somebody

ultimately
I
find
myself
back
Traddles
into
the
fireplace
,
and
bow
in
great
confusion
to
two
dry
little
elderly
lady
,
dress
in
black
,
and
each
look
wonderfully
like
a
preparation
in
chip
or
tan
of
the
late
Mr
Spenlow

"
Pray
,
"
say
one

be
seat

when
I
have
do
tumble
over
Traddles

have
sit
upon
something
which
be
not
a
cat
---
my
first
seat
be
---
<EOS>
I
so
far
recover
my
sight
,
as
to
perceive
that
Mr
Spenlow
have
evidently
be
the
young
of
the
family
;
that
there
be
a
disparity
of
six
or
eight
year
between
the
two
sister
;
and
that
the
young
appear
to
be
the
manager
of
the
conference
,
inasmuch
as
she
have
my
letter
in
her
hand
---
so
familiar
as
it
look
to
me
,
and
yet
so
odd
!
---
and
be
refer
to
it
through
an
eye
-
glass
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
dress
alike
,
but
this
sister
wear
her
dress
with
a
more
youthful
air
than
the
other
;
and
perhaps
have
a
trifle
more
frill
,
or
tucker
,
or
brooch
,
or
bracelet
,
or
some
little
thing
of
that
kind
,
which
make
her
look
more
lively
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
both
upright
in
their
carriage
,
formal
,
precise
,
compose
,
and
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
the
sister
who
have
not
my
letter
,
have
her
arm
cross
on
her
breast
,
and
rest
on
each
other
,
like
an
Idol
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
,
I
believe
,
"
say
the
sister
who
have
get
my
letter
,
address
herself
to
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
a
frightful
beginning
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
have
to
indicate
that
I
be
Mr
Copperfield
,
and
I
have
to
lay
claim
to
myself
,
and
they
have
to
divest
themselves
of
a
preconceived
opinion
that
Traddles
be
Mr
Copperfield
,
and
altogether
we
be
in
a
nice
condition
.
 
<EOS>
to
improve
it
,
we
all
distinctly
hear
Jip
give
two
short
bark
,
and
receive
another
choke
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Copperfield
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
sister
with
the
letter
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
something
---
<EOS>
bow
,
I
suppose
---
and
be
all
attention
,
when
the
other
sister
strike
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
sister
Lavinia
,
"
say
she
"
be
conversant
with
matter
of
this
nature
<EOS>
,
will
state
what
we
consider
most
calculated
to
promote
the
happiness
of
both
party
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
discover
afterwards
that
Miss
Lavinia
be
an
authority
in
affair
of
the
heart
,
by
reason
of
there
have
anciently
exist
a
certain
Mr
Pidger
,
who
play
short
whist
,
and
be
suppose
to
have
be
enamour
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
My
private
opinion
be
,
that
this
be
entirely
a
gratuitous
assumption
,
and
that
Pidger
be
altogether
innocent
of
any
such
sentiment
---
to
which
he
have
never
give
any
sort
of
expression
that

both

declare
his

if
he
have
not
be
cut
short
in

at
about
sixty

by
over

drink
his

over
-
do
an
attempt

set
it
right
again
by
swill
Bath
water

They
have
a
lurk
suspicion

love

I
must
say
there
be
a
picture
of
him
in

<EOS>
of
course
I
do
not
understand
then
that
this
be
an
allusion
to
her
supposed
experience
of
the
stricken

;
but
I
see
,
from
the
gravity
with
which
Miss

nod

that
great

be
attach
to
these

now
,
although
I
have
not

any
express
encouragement

yet
,
I
fancy
that
I
see
in
the
two
little
sister
,
and
particularly
in
Miss
Lavinia
,
an
intensify
enjoyment
of
this
new

fruitful
subject
of
domestic
interest

a
settle
down

make
the
most

it

ray

I
think
I
perceive
that

would
have
uncommon
satisfaction
in
superintend
two
young

that
Miss

have
hardly
less
satisfaction
in
see
her
superintend
us

in
chime
in
with
her
own
particular
department

the

that
impulse
be
strong
upon
her

<EOS>
this
give
me
courage
to
protest
most
vehemently
that
I
love
Dora
better
than
I
could
tell

that
all

that
my

It

that
no

They
persist
in

accordingly

these

hop
out
with
great

the

exactly
at

they

with
no

They

away

they
come
rustle
back

I

<EOS>
which
be
a
corruption
of
David

<EOS>
remonstrance
be
of
no
use
,
then
;
so
I
laugh
,
and
admire
,
and
be
very
much
in
love
and
very
happy
;
and
she
show
me
Jip
's
new
trick
of
stand
on
his
hind
leg
in
a
corner
---
which
he
do
for
about
the
space
of
a
flash
of
lightning
,
and
then
fall
down
---
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
know
how
long
I
should
have
stay
there
,
oblivious
of
traddle
,
if
Miss
Lavinia
have
not
come
in
to
take
me
away
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Lavinia
be
very
fond
of
Dora
<EOS>
(
she
tell
me
Dora
be
exactly
like
what
she
have
be
herself
at
her
age
---
she
must
have
alter
a
good
deal
)
,
and
she
treat
Dora
just
as
if
she
have
be
a
toy
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
persuade
Dora
to
come
and
see
Traddles
,
but
on
my
proposing
it
she
run
off
to
her
own
room
and
lock
herself
in
;
so
I
go
to
Traddles
without
her
,
and
walk
away
with
him
on
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
nothing
could
be
more
satisfactory
,
"
say
traddle
;
"
and
they
be
very
agreeable
old
lady
,
I
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
be
at
all
surprise
if
you
be
to
be
married
year
before
me
,
Copperfield
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
do
your
Sophy
play
on
any
instrument
,
Traddles
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
,
in
the
pride
of
my
heart
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
know
enough
of
the
piano
to
teach
it
to
her
little
sister
,
"
say
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
she
sing
at
all
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
she
sing
ballad
,
sometimes
,
to
freshen
up
the
other
a
little
when
they
be
out
of
spirit
,
"
say
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
nothing
scientific
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
do
not
sing
to
the
guitar
?
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
no
!
"
say
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
"
paint
at
all
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
,
"
say
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
I
promise
Traddles
that
he
should
hear
Dora
sing
,
and
see
some
of
her
flower
-
painting
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
he
should
like
it
very
much
,
and
we
go
home
arm
in
arm
in
great
good
humour
and
delight
.
 
<EOS>
I
encourage
him
to
talk
about
Sophy
,
on
the
way
;
which
he
do
with
a
love
reliance
on
her
that
I
very
much
admire
.
 
<EOS>
I
compare
her
in
my
mind
with
Dora
,
with
considerable
inward
satisfaction
;
but
I
candidly
admit
to
myself
that
she
seem
to
be
an
excellent
kind
of
girl
for
Traddles
,
too
.
   
<EOS>
of
course
my
aunt
be
immediately
make
acquainted
with
the
successful
issue
of
the
conference
,
and
with
all
that
have
be
say
and
do
in
the
course
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
happy
to
see
me
so
happy
,
and
promise
to
call
on
Dora
's
aunt
without
loss
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
take
such
a
long
walk
up
and
down
our
room
that
night
,
while
I
be
write
to
Agnes
,
that
I
begin
to
think
she
mean
to
walk
till
morning
.
   
<EOS>
My
letter
to
Agnes
be
a
fervent
and
grateful
one
,
narrate
all
the
good
effect
that
have
result
from
my
follow
her
advice
.
<EOS>
She
write
,
by
return
of
post
,
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Her
letter
be
hopeful
,
earnest
,
and
cheerful
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
always
cheerful
from
that
time
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
my
hand
more
full
than
ever
,
now
.
 
<EOS>
My
daily
journey
to
Highgate
consider
,
Putney
be
a
long
way
off
;
and
I
naturally
want
to
go
there
as
often
as
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
the
propose
tea
-
drinking
be
quite
impracticable
,
I
compound
with
Miss
Lavinia
for
permission
to
visit
every
Saturday
afternoon
,
without
detriment
to
my
privileged
Sundays
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
the
close
of
every
week
be
a
delicious
time
for
me
;
and
I
get
through
the
rest
of
the
week
by
look
forward
to
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
wonderfully
relieved
to
find
that
my
aunt
and
Dora
's
aunt
rub
on
,
<EOS>
all
thing
consider
,
much
more
smoothly
than
I
could
have
expect
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
make
her
promised
visit
within
a
few
day
of
the
conference
;
and
within
a
few
more
day
,
Dora
's
aunt
call
upon
her
,
in
due
state
and
form
.
 
<EOS>
similar
but
more
friendly
exchange
take
place
afterwards
,
usually
at
interval
of
three
or
four
week
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
my
aunt
distress
Dora
's
aunt
very
much
,
by
utterly
set
at
naught
the
dignity
of
fly
-
conveyance
,
and
walk
out
to
Putney
at
extraordinary
time
,
as
shortly
after
breakfast
or
just
before
tea
;
likewise
by
wear
her
bonnet
in
any
manner
that
happen
to
be
comfortable
to
her
head
,
without
at
all
defer
to
the
prejudice
of
civilization
on
that
subject
.
 
<EOS>
but
Dora
's
aunt
soon
agree
to
regard
my
aunt
as
an
eccentric
and
somewhat
masculine
lady
,
with
a
strong
understanding
;
and
although
my
aunt
occasionally
ruffle
the
feather
of
Dora
's
aunt
,
by
express
heretical
opinion
on
various
point
of
ceremony
,
she
love
me
too
well
not
to
sacrifice
some
of
her
little
peculiarity
to
the
general
harmony
.
   
<EOS>
the
only
member
of
our
small
society
who
positively
refuse
to
adapt
himself
to
circumstance
,
be
Jip
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
see
my
aunt
without
immediately
display
every
tooth
in
his
head
,
retire
under
a
chair
,
and
growl
incessantly
:
with
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
doleful
howl
,
as
if
she
really
be
too
much
for
his
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
all
kind
of
treatment
be
try
with
him
,
coax
,
scold
,
slap
,
bring
him
to
Buckingham
Street
(
where
he
instantly
dash
at
the
two
cat
,
to
the
terror
of
all
beholder
)
;
but
he
never
could
prevail
upon
himself
to
bear
my
aunt
's
society
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
sometimes
think
he
have
get
the
well
of
his
objection
,
and
be
amiable
for
a
few
minute
;
and
then
would
put
up
his
snub
nose
,
and
howl
to
that
extent
,
that
there
be
nothing
for
it
but
to
blind
him
and
put
him
in
the
plate
-
warm
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
Dora
regularly
muffle
him
in
a
towel
and
shut
him
up
there
,
whenever
my
aunt
be
report
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
one
thing
trouble
me
much
,
after
we
have
fall
into
this
quiet
train
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
,
that
Dora
seem
by
one
consent
to
be
regard
like
a
pretty
toy
or
plaything
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
with
whom
she
gradually
become
familiar
,
always
call
her
little
Blossom
;
and
the
pleasure
of
Miss
Lavinia
's
life
be
to
wait
upon
her
,
curl
her
hair
,
make
ornament
for
her
,
and
treat
her
like
a
pet
child
.
 
<EOS>
what
Miss
Lavinia
do
,
her
sister
do
as
a
matter
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
odd
to
me
;
but
they
all
seem
to
treat
Dora
,
in
her
degree
,
much
as
Dora
treat
Jip
in
his
.
   
<EOS>
I
make
up
my
mind
to
speak
to
Dora
about
this
;
and
one
day
when
we
be
out
walk
<EOS>
(
for
we
be
license
by
Miss
Lavinia
,
after
a
while
,
to
go
out
walk
by
ourselves
)
,
I
say
to
her
that
I
wish
she
could
get
them
to
behave
towards
her
differently
.
   
<EOS>
"
because
you
know
,
my
darling
,
"
I
remonstrate
,
"
you
be
not
a
child
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
there
!
"
say
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
now
you
be
go
to
be
cross
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Cross
,
my
love
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
they
be
very
kind
to
me
,
"
say
Dora
,
"
and
I
be
very
happy
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
but
my
dear
life
!
<EOS>
"
say
I
,
"
you
may
be
very
happy
,
and
yet
be
treat
rationally
.
"
   
<EOS>
Dora
give
me
a
reproachful
look
---
<EOS>
the
prettiest
look
!
<EOS>
---
and
then
begin
to
sob
,
say
,
if
I
do
not
like
her
,
why
have
I
ever
want
so
much
to
be
engage
to
her
?
 
<EOS>
and
why
do
not
I
go
away
,
now
,
if
I
could
not
bear
her
?
   
<EOS>
what
could
I
do
,
but
kiss
away
her
tear
,
and
tell
her
how
I
dote
on
her
,
after
that
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
be
very
affectionate
,
"
say
Dora
;
"
you
ought
not
to
be
cruel
to
me
,
Doady
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
cruel
,
my
precious
love
!
 
<EOS>
as
if
I
would
---
or
could
---
be
cruel
to
you
,
for
the
world
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
then
do
not
find
fault
with
me
,
"
say
Dora
,
make
a
rosebud
of
her
mouth
;
"
and
I
will
be
good
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
charm
by
her
presently
ask
me
,
of
her
own
accord
,
to
give
her
that
cookery
-
book
I
have
once
speak
of
,
and
to
show
her
how
to
keep
account
as
I
have
once
promise
I
would
.
 
<EOS>
I
bring
the
volume
with
me
on
my
next
visit
<EOS>
(
I
get
it
prettily
bind
,
first
,
to
make
it
look
less
dry
and
more
inviting
)
;
and
as
we
stroll
about
the
Common
,
I
show
her
an
old
housekeeping
-
book
of
my
aunt
's
,
and
give
her
a
set
of
tablet
,
and
a
pretty
little
pencil
-
case
and
box
of
lead
,
to
practise
housekeeping
with
.
   
<EOS>
but
the
cookery
-
book
make
Dora
's
head
ache
,
and
the
figure
make
her
cry
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
not
add
up
,
she
say
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
rub
them
out
,
and
draw
little
nosegay
and
likeness
of
me
and
Jip
,
all
over
the
tablet
.
   
<EOS>
then
I
playfully
try
verbal
instruction
in
domestic
matter
,
as
we
walk
about
on
a
Saturday
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
for
example
,
when
we
pass
a
butcher
's
shop
,
I
would
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
now
suppose
,
my
pet
,
that
we
be
married
,
and
you
be
go
to
buy
a
shoulder
of
mutton
for
dinner
,
would
you
know
how
to
buy
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
My
pretty
little
Dora
's
face
would
fall
,
and
she
would
make
her
mouth
into
a
bud
again
,
as
if
she
would
very
much
prefer
to
shut
mine
with
a
kiss
.
   
<EOS>
"
Would
you
know
how
to
buy
it
,
my
darling
?
<EOS>
"
I
would
repeat
,
perhaps
,
if
I
be
very
inflexible
.
   
<EOS>
Dora
would
think
a
little
,
and
then
reply
,
perhaps
,
with
great
triumph
:
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
the
butcher
would
know
how
to
sell
it
,
and
what
nee
I
know
?
<EOS>
oh
,
you
silly
boy
!
"
   
<EOS>
so
,
when
I
once
ask
Dora
,
with
an
eye
to
the
cookery
-
book
,
what
she
would
do
,
if
we
be
married
,
and
I
be
to
say
I
should
like
a
nice
irish
stew
,
she
reply
that
she
would
tell
the
servant
to
make
it
;
and
then
clap
her
little
hand
together
across
my
arm
,
and
laugh
in
such
a
charming
manner
that
she
be
more
delightful
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
consequently
,
the
principal
use
to
which
the
cookery
-
book
be
devote
,
be
be
put
down
in
the
corner
for
Jip
to
stand
upon
.
<EOS>
but
Dora
be
so
pleased
,
<EOS>
when
she
have
train
him
to
stand
upon
it
without
offer
to
come
off
,
and
at
the
same
time
to
hold
the
pencil
-
case
in
his
mouth
,
that
I
be
very
glad
I
have
buy
it
.
   
<EOS>
and
we
fall
back
on
the
guitar
-
case
,
and
the
flower
-
painting
,
and
the
song
about
never
leave
off
dance
,
<EOS>
Ta
ra
la
!
and
be
as
happy
as
the
week
be
long
.
 
<EOS>
I
occasionally
wish
I
could
venture
to
hint
to
Miss
Lavinia
,
that
she
treat
the
darling
of
my
heart
a
little
too
much
like
a
plaything
;
and
I
sometimes
awoke
,
as
it
be
,
wonder
to
find
that
I
have
fall
into
the
general
fault
,
and
treat
her
like
a
plaything
too
---
but
not
often
.

mischief
 
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
it
be
not
for
me
to
record
,
even
though
this
manuscript
be
intend
for
no
eye
but
mine
,
how
hard
I
work
at
that
tremendous
short
-
hand
,
and
all
improvement
appertain
to
it
,
in
my
sense
of
responsibility
to
Dora
and
her
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
only
add
,
to
what
I
have
already
write
of
my
perseverance
at
this
time
of
my
life
,
and
of
a
patient
and
continuous
energy
which
then
begin
to
be
mature
within
me
,
and
which
I
know
to
be
the
strong
part
of
my
character
,
if
it
have
any
strength
at
all
,
that
there
,
on
look
back
,
I
find
the
source
of
my
success
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
very
fortunate
in
worldly
matter
;
many
man
have
work
much
harder
,
and
not
succeed
half
so
well
;
but
I
never
could
have
do
what
I
have
do
,
without
the
habit
of
punctuality
,
order
,
and
diligence
,
without
the
determination
to
concentrate
myself
on
one
object
at
a
time
,
no
matter
how
quickly
its
successor
should
come
upon
its
heel
,
which
I
then
form
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
know
I
write
this
,
in
no
spirit
of
self
-
laudation
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
who
review
his
own
life
,
as
I
do
mine
,
in
go
on
here
,
from
page
to
page
,
have
nee
to
have
be
a
good
man
indeed
,
if
he
would
be
spare
the
sharp
consciousness
of
many
talent
neglect
,
many
opportunity
waste
,
many
erratic
and
perverted
feeling
constantly
at
war
within
his
breast
,
and
defeat
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
hold
one
natural
gift
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
that
I
have
not
abuse
.
 
<EOS>
My
meaning
simply
be
,
that
whatever
I
have
try
to
do
in
life
,
I
have
try
with
all
my
heart
to
do
well
;
that
whatever
I
have
devote
myself
to
,
I
have
devote
myself
to
completely
;
that
in
great
aim
and
in
small
,
I
have
always
be
thoroughly
in
earnest
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
believe
it
possible
that
any
natural
or
improve
ability
can
claim
immunity
from
the
companionship
of
the
steady
,
plain
,
hard
-
work
quality
,
and
hope
to
gain
its
end
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
such
thing
as
such
fulfilment
on
this
earth
.
 
<EOS>
some
happy
talent
,
and
some
fortunate
opportunity
,
may
form
the
two
side
of
the
ladder
on
which
some
man
mount
,
but
the
round
of
that
ladder
must
be
make
of
stuff
to
stand
wear
and
tear
;
and
there
be
no
substitute
for
thorough
-
go
,
ardent
,
and
sincere
earnestness
.
 
<EOS>
never
to
put
one
hand
to
anything
,
on
which
I
could
throw
my
whole
self
;
and
never
to
affect
depreciation
of
my
work
,
whatever
it
be
;
I
find
,
now
,
to
have
be
my
golden
rule
.
   
<EOS>
how
much
of
the
practice
I
have
just
reduce
to
precept
<EOS>
,
I
owe
to
Agnes
,
I
will
not
repeat
here
.
 
<EOS>
My
narrative
proceed
to
Agnes
,
with
a
thankful
love
.
   
<EOS>
She
come
on
a
visit
of
a
fortnight
to
the
Doctor
's
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Wickfield
be
the
Doctor
's
old
friend
,
and
the
doctor
wish
to
talk
with
him
,
and
do
him
good
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
matter
of
conversation
with
agne
when
she
be
last
in
town
,
and
this
visit
be
the
result
.
<EOS>
She
and
her
father
come
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
much
surprised
to
hear
from
her
that
she
have
engage
to
find
a
lodging
in
the
neighbourhood
for
Mrs
Heep
,
whose
rheumatic
complaint
require
change
of
air
,
and
who
would
be
charm
to
have
it
in
such
company
.
<EOS>
neither
be
I
surprised
when
,
on
the
very
next
day
,
Uriah
,
like
a
dutiful
son
,
bring
his
worthy
mother
to
take
possession
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
say
he
,
as
he
force
himself
upon
my
company
for
a
turn
in
the
Doctor
's
garden
,
"
where
a
person
love
,
a
person
be
a
little
jealous
---
leastway
,
anxious
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
beloved
one
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
of
whom
be
you
jealous
,
now
?
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
thank
to
you
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
he
return
,
"
of
no
one
in
particular
just
at
present
---
no
male
person
,
at
least
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
mean
that
you
be
jealous
of
a
female
person
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
give
me
a
sidelong
glance
out
of
his
sinister
red
eye
,
and
laugh
.
   
<EOS>
"
really
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
he
say
,
"
---
I
should
say
Mister
,
but
I
know
you
will
excuse
the
abit
I
have
get
into
---
you
be
so
insinuating
,
that
you
draw
me
like
a
corkscrew
!
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
do
not
mind
tell
you
,
"
put
his
fish
-
like
hand
on
mine
,
"
I
be
not
a
lady
's
man
in
general
,
sir
,
and
I
never
be
,
with
Mrs
Strong
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
eye
look
green
now
,
as
they
watch
mine
with
a
rascally
cunning
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
?
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
though
I
be
a
lawyer
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
he
reply
,
with
a
dry
grin
,
"
I
mean
,
just
at
present
,
what
I
say
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
and
what
do
you
mean
by
your
look
?
<EOS>
"
I
retort
,
quietly
.
   
<EOS>
"
by
my
look
?
 
<EOS>
dear
me
,
Copperfield
,
that
be
sharp
practice
!
 
<EOS>
what
do
I
mean
by
my
look
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
by
your
look
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
seem
very
much
amuse
,
and
laugh
as
heartily
as
it
be
in
his
nature
to
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
after
some
scraping
of
his
chin
with
his
hand
,
he
go
on
to
say
,
with
his
eye
cast
downward
---
still
scrape
,
very
slowly
:
   
<EOS>
"
when
I
be
but
an
umble
clerk
,
she
always
look
down
upon
me
.
<EOS>
She
be
for
ever
have
my
Agnes
backwards
and
forwards
at
her
ouse
,
and
she
be
for
ever
be
a
friend
to
you
,
Master
Copperfield
;
but
I
be
too
far
beneath
her
,
myself
,
to
be
notice
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
well
?
"
say
I
;
"
suppose
you
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
---
and
beneath
him
too
,
"
pursue
Uriah
,
very
distinctly
,
and
in
a
meditative
tone
of
voice
,
as
he
continue
to
scrape
his
chin
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
know
the
doctor
better
,
"
say
I
,
"
than
to
suppose
him
conscious
of
your
existence
,
when
you
be
not
before
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
direct
his
eye
at
me
in
that
sidelong
glance
again
,
and
he
make
his
face
very
lantern
-
jaw
,
for
the
great
convenience
of
scraping
,
as
he
answer
:
   
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
,
I
be
not
refer
to
the
Doctor

<EOS>
oh
no
,
poor
man
!
 
<EOS>
I
mean
Mr
Maldon
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
My
heart
quite
die
within
me
.
 
<EOS>
all
my
old
doubt
and
apprehension
on
that
subject
,
all
the
doctor
's
happiness
and
peace
,
all
the
mingled
possibility
of
innocence
and
compromise
,
that
I
could
not
unravel
,
I
see
,
in
a
moment
,
at
the
mercy
of
this
fellow
's
twisting
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
never
could
come
into
the
office
,
without
order
and
shove
me
about
,
"
say
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
"
one
of
your
fine
gentleman
he
be

<EOS>
I
be
very
meek
and
umble

I
be

<EOS>
but
I
do
not

<EOS>
and
I
do
not

"
   
<EOS>
He
leave
off
scrape
his
chin
,
and
suck
in
his
cheek
until
they
seem
to
meet
inside
;
keep
his
sidelong
glance
upon
me
all
the
while
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
be
one
of
your
lovely
woman

she
be

"
he
pursue
,
when
he
have
slowly
restore
his
face
to
its
natural
form
;
"
and
ready
to
be
no
friend

such
as
me

I
know

<EOS>
She
be
just
the
person
as
would
put
my
Agnes
up
to
high
sort
of
game

<EOS>
now
,
I
be
not
one
of
your
lady

man

Master
Copperfield

but
I
have
have
eye
in

a
pretty
long
time
back

<EOS>
We
umble
one

get
eye

mostly
speak

we
look
out

<EOS>
I
endeavour
to
appear
unconscious
and
not
disquiet
,
but
<EOS>
,
I
see
in
his
face
,
with
poor
success
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
I
be
not
a

go
to

myself
be
run
down

he
continue
,
raise
that
part
of
his
countenance
,
where
his
red
eyebrow
would
have
be
if
he
have
have
any

with
malignant
triumph
,
"
and
I
shall
do
what
I
can

stop

I
do

<EOS>
I
do
not

acknowledge

rather
a
grudging
disposition

want

I
be

You
be

plot

delude

I.

perhaps
so

he
reply

I
have
get
a
motive
,
as
my
fellow

partner
use
to
say
;

I
go
at
it
tooth
and
nail
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
not
be
put
upon

as
a

person

too
much

I
can
not
allow
people
in

out

I
do

he
return

with
one
of
his
jerk

"
I
be
astonish
at
that
,
Master
Copperfield

you

so
quick

I
will
try

another

It
look
like
him

I
reply

as
carelessly

I
could

Uriah
stop
short
,
put
his
hand
between
his
great
knob
of
knee
,

double
himself
up
with
laughter

with
perfectly
silent
laughter
.
 
<EOS>
not
a
sound
escape
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
repel
by
his
odious
behaviour
,
particularly
by
this
conclude
instance
,
that
I
turn
away
without
any
ceremony
;
and
leave
him
double
up
in
the
middle
of
the
garden
,
like
a
scarecrow
in
want
of
support
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
on
that
evening
;
but
,
as
I
well
remember
,
on
the
next
evening
but
one
,
which
be
a
Sunday
;
that
I
take
agne
to
see
Dora
.
<EOS>
I
have
arrange
the
visit
,
beforehand
,
with
Miss
Lavinia
;
and
Agnes
be
expect
to
tea
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
in
a
flutter
of
pride
and
anxiety
;
pride
in
my
dear
little
betrothed
,
and
anxiety
that
agne
should
like
her
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
way
to
Putney
,
Agnes
be
inside
the
stage
-
coach
,
and
I
outside
,
I
picture
Dora
to
myself
in
every
one
of
the
pretty
look
I
know
so
well
;
now
make
up
my
mind
that
I
should
like
her
to
look
exactly
as
she
look
at
such
a
time
,
and
then
doubt
whether
I
should
not
prefer
her
look
as
she
look
at
such
another
time
;
and
almost
worry
myself
into
a
fever
about
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
trouble
by
no
doubt
of
her
be
very
pretty
,
in
any
case
;
but
it
fall
out
that
I
have
never
see
her
look
so
well
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
not
in
the
drawing
-
room
when
I
present
agne
to
her
little
aunt
,
but
be
shyly
keep
out
of
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
where
to
look
for
her
,
now
;
and
sure
enough
I
find
her
stop
her
ear
again
,
behind
the
same
dull
old
door
.
   
<EOS>
at
first
she
would
not
come
at
all
;
and
then
she
plead
for
five
minute
by
my
watch
.
 
<EOS>
when
at
length
she
put
her
arm
through
mine
,
to
be
take
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
her
charming
little
face
be
flush
,
and
have
never
be
so
pretty
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
when
we
go
into
the
room
,
and
it
turn
pale
,
she
be
ten
thousand
time
pretty
yet
.
   
<EOS>
Dora
be
afraid
of
Agnes
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
tell
me
that
she
know
Agnes
be
"
too
clever
"
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
she
see
her
look
at
once
so
cheerful
and
so
earnest
,
and
so
thoughtful
,
and
so
good
,
she
give
a
faint
little
cry
of
pleased
surprise
,
and
just
put
her
affectionate
arm
round
Agnes
's
neck
,
and
lay
her
innocent
cheek
against
her
face
.
   
<EOS>
I
never
be
so
happy
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
be
so
pleased
as
when
I
see
those
two
sit
down
together
,
side
by
side
.
 
<EOS>
as
when
I
see
my
little
darling
look
up
so
naturally
to
those
cordial
eye
.
 
<EOS>
as
when
I
see
the
tender
,
beautiful
regard
which
agne
cast
upon
her
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Lavinia
and
Miss
Clarissa
partake
,
in
their
way
,
of
my
joy
.
<EOS>
It

the
pleasantest
tea

,
as

and
we

<EOS>
the

Her
quiet

in
everything
that
interested
Dora
;
her
manner
of

acquaintance
with
Jip

who
respond
instantly
)
;
her
pleasant
way
,
when
Dora
be
ashamed
to
come
over
to
her
usual
seat
by
me
;
her
modest
grace
and
ease
,
elicit
a
crowd
of
blush
little
mark
of
confidence
from
Dora
;
seem
to
make
our

quite
complete

<EOS>
"
I

Dora

after

<EOS>
Agnes
say
she
be
afraid
I
must
have
give
her
an
unpromising
character
;
but
Dora

that
directly

<EOS>
"
<EOS>

she

<EOS>
He
think
so
much
of
your
opinion
,
that
I
be
quite
afraid
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
good
opinion
can
not
strengthen
his
attachment
to
some
people
whom
he
know
,
"
say
Agnes
,
with
a
smile
;
"
it
be
not
worth
their

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
but
please

have
it

"
say
Dora
,
in
her

way
,
"
if
you

"
   
<EOS>
We
make
merry
about
Dora
's
want
to
be
like
,
and
Dora
say
I
be
a
goose
,
and
she
do
not
like
me
at
any
rate
,
and
the
short
evening
fly
away
on
gossamer

wing
.
 
<EOS>
the
time
be
at
hand
when
the
coach

<EOS>
I
be
stand
alone
before
the
fire
,
when
Dora
come
steal
softly
in
,
to
give
me
that
usual
precious
little
kiss
before
I
go
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
not

if
I

Dora

her
bright

very
brightly

and
her

itself
with

My

of

dear
bad
boy

"
   
<EOS>
"
no

I

"
but
we
be
bring
up
together
,
like
brother

sister

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
why
you
ever
fall
in
love
with
me
?
"
say
Dora
,
begin
on
another
button
of
my
coat
.
   
<EOS>
"
perhaps
because
I
could
not
see
you
,
and
not
love
you
,
Dora
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
suppose
you
have
never

me
at
all

"
say
Dora

go
to
another
button
.
   
<EOS>
"
suppose
we
have
never
be
bear
!
"
<EOS>
say
I
,
gaily
.
   
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
she
be
think
about
,
as
I
glance
in
admire
silence
at
the
little
soft
hand
travel
up
the
row
of
button
on
my
coat
,
and
at
the
clustering
hair
that
lie
against
my
breast
,
and
at
the
lash
of
her
downcast
eye
,
slightly
rise
as
they
follow
her
idle
finger
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
her
eye
be
lift
up
to
mine
,
and
she
stand
on
tiptoe
to
give
me
,
more
thoughtfully
than
usual
,
that
precious
little
kiss
---
once
,
twice
,
three
time
---
and
go
out
of
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
They
all
come
back
together
within
five
minute
afterwards
,
and
Dora
's
unusual
thoughtfulness
be
quite
go
then
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
laughingly
resolve
to
put
Jip
through
the
whole
of
his
performance
,
before
the
coach
come
.
 
<EOS>
They
take
some
time
(
not
so
much
on
account
of
their
variety
,
as
Jip
's
reluctance
)
,
and
be
still
unfinished
when
it
be
hear
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
hurried
but
affectionate
parting
between
Agnes
and
herself
;
and
Dora
be
to
write
to
Agnes
(
who
be
not
to
mind
her
letter
be
foolish
,
she
say
)
,
and
Agnes
be
to
write
to
Dora
;
and
they
have
a
second
parting
at
the
coach
door
,
and
a
third
when
Dora
,
in
spite
of
the
remonstrance
of
Miss
Lavinia
,
would
come
run
out
once
more
to
remind
agne
at
the
coach
window
about
writing
,
and
to
shake
her
curl
at
me
on
the
box
.
   
<EOS>
the
stage

coach
be
to
put
us
down
near
Covent
Garden
,
where
we
be
to
take
another
stage
-
coach
for
Highgate
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
impatient
for
the
short
walk
in
the
interval
,
that
Agnes
may
praise
Dora
to
me
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
what
praise
it
be
!
 
<EOS>
how
lovingly
and
fervently
do
it
commend
the
pretty
creature
I
have
win
,
with
all
her
artless
grace
best
display
,
to
my
most
gentle
care

<EOS>
how
thoughtfully
remind
me
,
yet
with
no
pretence
of
do
so
,
of
the
trust
in
which
I
hold
the
orphan
child
!
   
<EOS>
never
,
never
,
have
I
love
Dora
so
deeply
and
truly
,
as
I
love
her
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
have
again
alight
,
and
be
walk
in
the
starlight
along
the
quiet
road
that
lead
to
the
Doctor

house

I
tell
Agnes
it
be
her
do
.
   
<EOS>
"
when
you
be
sit
by
her
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
seem
to
be
no
less
her
guardian
angel
than
mine

you
seem
so
now

Agnes

<EOS>
"
a
poor
angel

but
faithful

"
   
<EOS>
the
clear
tone
of
her
voice
,
go
straight
to
my
heart
,
make
it
natural
to
me
to
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
the
cheerfulness
that
belong
to
you
,
Agnes

<EOS>

to
no

that
I

happy
at

<EOS>
"
I
be
happy
in
myself
,
"
she
say
;
"
I
be
quite
cheerful
and
light

hearted

<EOS>
I
glance
at
the
serene
face
look
upward
,

think
it
be
the
star
that
make
it
seem
so
noble

there

when
we
part
last
?

<EOS>
"
no

none

she
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
think
so
much
about
it

You
must
think
less
about
it

<EOS>
remember
that
I
confide
in
simple

truth
at
last

<EOS>
have
no
apprehension

me

Trotwood
<EOS>

"
she
add
,
after
a
moment
;
"
the
step
you
dread
my
taking
,
I
shall
never
take

"
   
<EOS>
although
I
think
I
have
never
really
fear
it
,
in
any
season
of
cool
reflection
,
it
be
an
unspeakable
relief
to
me
to
have
this
assurance
from

truthful
lip

I
tell
her
so

earnestly

London
again

probably
a
long
time

she
reply
;

I

it
will
be
good

to
remain
at

<EOS>
We
be
not
likely
to
meet
often
,
for
some
time
to
come
;
but
I
shall
be
a
good
correspondent
of
Dora

we
shall
frequently
hear
of
one
another
that
way

<EOS>
We
be
now
within
the
little
courtyard
of
the
Doctor

cottage

It

late

there

<EOS>
in
her
beaming
smile
,

in
these
last
tone
of
her
cheerful
voice
,
I
seem
again
to
see
and
hear
my
little
Dora
in
her
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
stand
awhile
,
look
through
the
porch
at
the
star
,
with
a
heart
full
of
love
and
gratitude
,
and
then
walk
slowly
forth

I

engage
a
bed
at

decent
alehouse
close
by

be
go
out
at
the
gate

when
,
happen
to
turn
my
head
,
I
see
a
light
in
the
Doctor

study

<EOS>
a
half

reproachful
fancy
come
into
my

that
he

work
at

with

in

of
bid
him
good
night

I
turn
back

go
softly
across

gently
open

look
in

forward

the
doctor
's
arm
.
   
<EOS>
for
an
instant
,
I
suppose
that
the
Doctor
be
ill
.
 
<EOS>
I
hastily
advance
a
step
under
that
impression
,
when
I
meet
Uriah
's
eye
,
and
see
what
be
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
withdraw
,
but
the
Doctor
make
a
gesture
to
detain
me
,
and
I
remain
.
   
<EOS>
"
at
any
rate
,
"
observe
Uriah
,
with
a
writhe
of
his
ungainly
person
,
"
we
may
keep
the
door
shut
.
 
<EOS>
We
need
not
make
it
known
to
all
the
town
.
"
   
<EOS>
say
which
,
he
go
on
his
toe
to
the
door
,
which
I
have
leave
open
,
and
carefully
close
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
come
back
,
and
take
up
his
former
position
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
obtrusive
show
of
compassionate
zeal
in
his
voice
and
manner
,
more
intolerable
---
at
least
to
me
---
than
any
demeanour
he
could
have
assume
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
feel
it
incumbent
upon
me
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
say
Uriah
,
"
to
point
out
to
Doctor
Strong
what
you
and
me
have
already
talk
about
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
not
exactly
understand
me
,
though
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
give
him
a
look
,
but
no
other
answer
;
and
,
go
to
my
good
old
master
,
say
a
few
word
that
I
mean
to
be
word
of
comfort
and
encouragement
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
,
as
it
have
be
his
custom
to
do
when
I
be
quite
a
little
fellow
,
but
do
not
lift
his
grey
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
as
you
do
not
understand
me
,
Master
Copperfield

resume
Uriah
in
the
same
officious
manner
,
"
I
may
take
the
liberty
of
umbly
mention
,
be
among
friend
,
that
I
have
call
Doctor
Strong

attention
to
the
going
-
on
of
Mrs
Strong

<EOS>
It
be
much
against
the
grain
with
me
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
Copperfield
,
to
be
concern
in
anything
so
unpleasant
;
but
really
,
as
it
be
,
we
be
all
mix
ourselves
up
with
what
ought
not
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
what
my
meaning
be
,
sir
,
when
you
do
not
understand
me

I
wonder
now
,
when
I
recall
his

I
do
not
collar
him

try

shake
the
breath
out

his

myself
very
clear

on

you
neither

<EOS>
naturally
,
we
be
both
of
us
inclined
to
give
such
a
subject
a
wide
berth
.
 
<EOS>
hows'ever
,
at
last
I
have
make
up
my
mind
to
speak
plain
;

I
have
mention
to
Doctor
Strong

do
you
speak
,
sir

<EOS>
this
be
to
the
Doctor

have
moan
.

sound

any
heart

the

come

up

out

it

down

writhe
himself
into

silence

eel

full

so
far

I
ought

take
the
liberty

notice
it

the
good
intention

do
not
do
it

<EOS>
I
see
the
mild
eye
of
the
good
old
Doctor
turn
upon
me
for
a
moment
,
and
I
feel
that
the
confession
of
my
old
misgiving
and
remembrance
be
too
plainly
write
in
my
face
to
be
overlook

<EOS>
It
be

I

I
could

be
silent
again

remain
so

until
the
Doctor
rise
and
walk
twice

thrice
across
the
room

<EOS>
presently
he
return
to
where
his
chair
stand
;
and
,
lean
on
the
back
of
it

and
occasionally
put
his
handkerchief
to
his
eye

with
a
simple
honesty
that
do
him
more
honour

to
my
thinking

expose
one

aspersion

aspersion

never

give
a

of
snivel

express
sympathy

my

Gentlemen

I
be
old
now

as
you
know
;
I
do
not
feel
,
tonight
,
that
I
have
much
to
live
for
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
life
---
my
life
---
upon
the
truth
and
honour
of
the
dear
lady
who
have
be
the
subject
of
this
conversation
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
the
good
embodiment
of
chivalry
,
the
realization
of
the
handsome
and
most
romantic
figure
ever
imagine
by
painter
,
could
have
say
this
,
with
a
more
impressive
and
affect
dignity
than
the
plain
old
Doctor
do
.
   
<EOS>
"
but
I
be
not
prepared
,
"
he
go
on
,
"
to
deny
---
<EOS>
perhaps
I
may
have
be
,
without
know
it
,
in
some
degree
prepare
to
admit
---
that
I
may
have
unwittingly
ensnare
that
lady
into
an
unhappy
marriage
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
man
quite
unaccustomed
to
observe
;
and
I
can
not
but
believe
that
the
observation
of
several
people
,
of
different
age
and
position
,
all
too
plainly
tend
in
one
direction
(
and
that
so
natural
)
,
be
well
than
mine
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
have
often
admire
,
as
I
have
elsewhere
describe
,
his
benignant
manner
towards
his
youthful
wife
;
but
the
respectful
tenderness
he
manifest
in
every
reference
to
her
on
this
occasion
,
and
the
almost
reverential
manner
in
which
he
put
away
from
him
the
light
doubt
of
her
integrity
,
exalt
him
,
in
my
eye
,
beyond
description
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
marry
that
lady
,
"
say
the
Doctor
,
"
when
she
be
extremely
young
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
her
to
myself
when
her
character
be
scarcely
form
.
 
<EOS>
so
far
as
it
be
develop
,
it
have
be
my
happiness
to
form
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
her
father
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
her
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
teach
her
what
I
could
,
for
the
love
of
all
her
beautiful
and
virtuous
quality
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
do
her
wrong
;
as
I
fear
I
do
,
in
take
advantage
(
but
I
never
mean
it
)
of
her
gratitude
and
her
affection
;
I
ask
pardon
of
that
lady
,
in
my
heart
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
walk
across
the
room
,
and
come
back
to
the
same
place
;
hold
the
chair
with
a
grasp
that
tremble
,
like
his
subdued
voice
,
in
its
earnestness
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
regard
myself
as
a
refuge
,
for
her
,
from
the
danger
and
vicissitude
of
life

<EOS>
I
persuade
myself
that
,
unequal
though
we
be
in
year
,
she
would
live
tranquilly
and
contentedly
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
shut
out
of
my
consideration
the
time
when
I
should
leave
her
free
,
and
still
young
and
still
beautiful
,
but
with
her
judgement
more
matured
---
no
,
gentleman
---
upon
my
truth
!
"
   
<EOS>
His
homely
figure
seem
to
be
lighten
up
by
his
fidelity
and
generosity
.
 
<EOS>
every
word
he
utter
have
a
force
that
no
other
grace
could
have
impart
to
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
life
with
this
lady
have
be
very
happy

<EOS>
until
tonight

I
have
have
uninterrupted
occasion

bless
the
day
on
which
I
do
her
great
injustice
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
voice
,
more
and
more
faltering
in
the
utterance
of
these
word
,
stop
for
a
few
moment
;
then
he
go
on
:
   
"
<EOS>
once
awaken
from
my
dream
---
I
have
be
a
poor
dreamer
,
in
one
way
or
other
,
all
my
life
<EOS>
---
I
see
how
natural
it
be
that
she
should
have
some
regretful
feeling
towards
her
old
companion
and
her
equal
.
 
<EOS>
that
she
do
regard
him
with
some
innocent
regret
,
with
some
blameless
thought
of
what
may
have
be
,
but
for
me
,
be
,
I
fear
,
too
true
.
 
<EOS>
much
that
I
have
see
,
but
not
note
,
have
come
back
upon
me
with
new
meaning
,
during
this
last
try
hour
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
beyond
this
,
gentleman
,
the
dear
lady
's
name
never
must
be
couple
with
a
word
,
a
breath
,
of
doubt
.
"
   
<EOS>
for
a
little
while
,
his
eye
kindle
and
his
voice
be
firm
;
for
a
little
while
he
be
again
silent
.
 
<EOS>
presently
,
he
proceed
as
before
:
   
<EOS>
"
It
only
remain
for
me
,
to
bear
the
knowledge
of
the
unhappiness
I
have
occasion
,
as
submissively
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
she
who
should
reproach
;
not
I.
 
<EOS>
to
save
her
from
misconstruction
,
cruel
misconstruction
,
that
even
my
friend
have
not
be
able
to
avoid
,
become
my
duty
.
 
<EOS>
the
more
retire
we
live
,
the
well
I
shall
discharge
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
the
time
come
---
may
it
come
soon
,
if
it
be
His
merciful
pleasure
!
<EOS>
---
when
my
death
shall
release
her
from
constraint
,
I
shall
close
my
eye
upon
her
honoured
face
,
with
unbounded
confidence
and
love
;
and
leave
her
,
with
no
sorrow
then
,
to
happy
and
bright
day
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
see
him
for
the
tear
which
his
earnestness
and
goodness
,
so
adorn
by
,
and
so
adorn
,
the
perfect
simplicity
of
his
manner
,
bring
into
my
eye
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
move
to
the
door
,
when
he
add
:
   
"
<EOS>
gentleman
,
I
have
show
you
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
will
respect
it
.
 
<EOS>
what
we
have
say
tonight
be
never
to
be
say
more
.
<EOS>
Wickfield
,
give
me
an
old
friend
's
arm
upstairs
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Wickfield
hasten
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
without
interchange
a
word
they
go
slowly
out
of
the
room
together
,
Uriah
look
after
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
Master
Copperfield
!
<EOS>
"
say
Uriah
,
meekly
turn
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
thing
have
not
take
quite
the
turn
that
may
have
be
expect
,
for
the
old
Scholar
---
what
an
excellent
man
!
<EOS>
---
be
as
blind
as
a
brickbat
;
but
this
family
be
out
of
the
cart
,
I
think
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
need
but
the
sound
of
his
voice
to
be
so
madly
enrage
as
I
never
be
before
,
and
never
have
be
since
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
villain
,
"
say
I
,
"
what
do
you
mean
by
entrap
me
into
your
scheme
?
 
<EOS>
how
dare
you
appeal
to
me
just
now
,
you
false
rascal
,
as
if
we
have
be
in
discussion
together
?
"
   
<EOS>
as
we
stand
,
front
to
front
,
I
see
so
plainly
,
in
the
stealthy
exultation
of
his
face
,
what
I
already
so
plainly
know
;
I
mean
that
he
force
his
confidence
upon
me
,
expressly
to
make
me
miserable
,
and
have
set
a
deliberate
trap
for
me
in
this
very
matter
;
that
I
could
not
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
of
his
lank
cheek
be
invitingly
before
me
,
and
I
strike
it
with
my
open
hand
with
that
force
that
my
finger
tingle
as
if
I
have
burn
them
.
   
<EOS>
He
catch
the
hand
in
his
,
and
we
stand
in
that
connexion
,
look
at
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
We
stand
so
,
a
long
time
;
long
enough
for
me
to
see
the
white
mark
of
my
finger
die
out
of
the
deep
red
of
his
cheek
,
and
leave
it
a
deep
red
.
   
<EOS>
"
Copperfield
,
"
he
say
at
length
,
in
a
breathless
voice
,
"
<EOS>
have
you
take
leave
of
your
sense
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
take
leave
of
you
,
"
say
I
,
wrest
my
hand
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
dog
,
I
will
know
no
more
of
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
will
not
you
?
"
say
he
,
constrain
by
the
pain
of
his
cheek
to
put
his
hand
there
.
 
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
will
not
be
able
to
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
be
not
this
ungrateful
of
you
,
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
show
you
often
enough
,
"
say
I
,
"
that
I
despise
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
show
you
now
,
more
plainly
,
that
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
why
should
I
dread
your
do
your
bad
to
all
about
you
?
 
<EOS>
what
else
do
you
ever
do
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
perfectly
understand
this
allusion
to
the
consideration
that
have
hitherto
restrain
me
in
my
communication
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
rather
think
that
neither
the
blow
,
nor
the
allusion
,
would
have
escape
me
,
but
for
the
assurance
I
have
have
from
Agnes
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
matter
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
another
long
pause
.
 
<EOS>
His
eye
,
as
he
look
at
me
,
seem
to
take
every
shade
of
colour
that
could
make
eye
ugly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Copperfield
,
"
he
say
,
remove
his
hand
from
his
cheek
,
"
you
have
always
go
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
always
use
to
be
against
me
at
Mr
Wickfield
's
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
think
what
you
like
,
"
say
I
,
still
in
a
towering
rage
.
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
not
true
,
so
much
the
worthier
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
yet
I
always
like
you
,
Copperfield
!
"
<EOS>
he
rejoin
.
   
<EOS>
I
deign
to
make
him
no
reply
;
and
,
take
up
my
hat
,
be
go
out
to
bed
,
when
he
come
between
me
and
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Copperfield
,
"
he
say
,
"
there
must
be
two
party
to
a
quarrel
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
be
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
go
to
the
devil
!
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
do
not
say
that
!
"
<EOS>
he
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
will
be
sorry
afterwards
.
<EOS>
how
can
you
make
yourself
so
inferior
to
me
,
as
to
show
such
a
bad
spirit
?
 
<EOS>
but
I
forgive
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
forgive
me
!
"
<EOS>
I
repeat
disdainfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
and
you
can
not
help
yourself
,
"
reply
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
"
to
think
of
your
go
and
attack
me
,
that
have
always
be
a
friend
to
you
!
<EOS>
but
there
can
not
be
a
quarrel
without
two
party
,
and
I
will
not
be
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
be
a
friend
to
you
,
in
spite
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
so
now
you
know
what
you
have
get
to
expect
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
necessity
of
carry
on
this
dialogue
(
his
part
in
which
be
very
slow
;
mine
very
quick
)
in
a
low
tone
,
that
the
house
may
not
be
disturb
at
an
unseasonable
hour
,
do
not
improve
my
temper
;
though
my
passion
be
cool
down
.
 
<EOS>
merely
tell
him
that
I
should
expect
from
him
what
I
always
have
expect
,
and
have
never
yet
be
disappoint
in
,
I
open
the
door
upon
him
,
as
if
he
have
be
a
great
walnut
put
there
to
be
crack
,
and
go
out
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
sleep
out
of
the
house
too
,
at
his
mother
's
lodging
;
and
before
I
have
go
many
hundred
yard
,
come
up
with
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
Copperfield
,
"
he
say
,
in
my
ear
(
I
do
not
turn
my
head
)
,
"
you
be
in
quite
a
wrong
position
"
;
which
I
feel
to
be
true
,
and
that
make
me
chafe
the
more
;
"
you
can
not
make
this
a
brave
thing
,
and
you
can
not
help
be
forgive
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
intend
to
mention
it
to
mother
,
nor
to
any
live
soul
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
determined
to
forgive
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
wonder
that
you
should
lift
your
hand
against
a
person
that
you
know
to
be
so
umble
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
feel
only
less
mean
than
he
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
me
better
than
I
know
myself
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
retort
or
openly
exasperate
me
,
it
would
have
be
a
relief
and
a
justification
;
but
he
have
put
me
on
a
slow
fire
,
on
which
I
lie
torment
half
the
night
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
morning
,
when
I
come
out
,
the
early
church
-
bell
be
ring
,
and
he
be
walk
up
and
down
with
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
He
address
me
as
if
nothing
have
happen
,
and
I
could
do
no
less
than
reply
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
strike
him
hard
enough
to
give
him
the
toothache
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
at
all
event
his
face
be
tie
up
in
a
black
silk
handkerchief
,
which
,
with
his
hat
perch
on
the
top
of
it
,
be
far
from
improve
his
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
that
he
go
to
a
dentist
's
in
London
on
the
Monday
morning
,
and
have
a
tooth
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
be
a
double
one
.
   
<EOS>
the
Doctor
give
out
that
he
be
not
quite
well
;
and
remain
alone
,
for
a
considerable
part
of
every
day
,
during
the
remainder
of
the
visit
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
and
her
father
have
be
go
a
week
,
before
we
resume
our
usual
work
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
day
precede
its
resumption
,
the
Doctor
give
me
with
his
own
hand
a
fold
note
not
seal
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
address
to
myself
;
and
lay
an
injunction
on
me
,
in
a
few
affectionate
word
,
never
to
refer
to
the
subject
of
that
evening
.
<EOS>
I
have
confide
it
to
my
aunt
,
but
to
no
one
else
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
subject
I
could
discuss
with
agne
,
and
Agnes
certainly
have
not
the
least
suspicion
of
what
have
pass
.
   
<EOS>
neither
,
I
feel
convinced
,
have
Mrs
Strong
then
.
 
<EOS>
several
week
elapse
before
I
see
the
least
change
in
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
come
on
slowly
,
like
a
cloud
when
there
be
no
wind
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
,
she
seem
to
wonder
at
the
gentle
compassion
with
which
the
Doctor
speak
to
her
,
and
at
his
wish
that
she
should
have
her
mother
with
her
,
to
relieve
the
dull
monotony
of
her
life
.
 
<EOS>
often
,
when
we
be
at
work
,
and
she
be
sit
by
,
I
would
see
her
pause
and
look
at
him
with
that
memorable
face
.
 
<EOS>
afterwards
,
I
sometimes
observe
her
rise
,
with
her
eye
full
of
tear
,
and
go
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
gradually
,
an
unhappy
shadow
fall
upon
her
beauty
,
and
deepen
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Markleham
be
a
regular
inmate
of
the
cottage
then
;
but
she
talk
and
talk
,
and
see
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
as
this
change
steal
on
Annie
,
once
like
sunshine
in
the
Doctor
's
house
,
the
Doctor
become
old
in
appearance
,
and
more
grave
;
but
the
sweetness
of
his
temper
,
the
placid
kindness
of
his
manner
,
and
his
benevolent
solicitude
for
her
,
if
they
be
capable
of
any
increase
,
be
increase
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
once
,
early
on
the
morning
of
her
birthday
,
when
she
come
to
sit
in
the
window
while
we
be
at
work
(
which
she
have
always
do
,
but
now
begin
to
do
with
a
timid
and
uncertain
air
that
I
think
very
touching
)
,
take
her
forehead
between
his
hand
,
kiss
it
,
and
go
hurriedly
away
,
too
much
move
to
remain
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
her
stand
where
he
have
leave
her
,
like
a
statue
;
and
then
bend
down
her
head
,
and
clasp
her
hand
,
and
weep
,
I
can
not
say
how
sorrowfully
.
   
<EOS>
sometimes
,
after
that
,
I
fancy
that
she
try
to
speak
even
to
me
,
in
interval
when
we
be
leave
alone
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
never
utter
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
the
Doctor
always
have
some
new
project
for
her
participate
in
amusement
away
from
home
,
with
her
mother
;
and
Mrs
Markleham
,
who
be
very
fond
of
amusement
,
and
very
easily
dissatisfied
with
anything
else
,
enter
into
them
with
great
good
-
will
,
and
be
loud
in
her
commendation
.
 
<EOS>
but
Annie
,
in
a
spiritless
unhappy
way
,
only
go
whither
she
be
lead
,
and
seem
to
have
no
care
for
anything
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
to
think
.
 
<EOS>
neither
do
my
aunt
;
who
must
have
walk
,
at
various
time
,
a
hundred
mile
in
her
uncertainty
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
strange
of
all
be
,
that
the
only
real
relief
which
seem
to
make
its
way
into
the
secret
region
of
this
domestic
unhappiness
,
make
its
way
there
in
the
person
of
Mr
Dick
.
   
<EOS>
what
his
thought
be
on
the
subject
,
or
what
his
observation
be
,
I
be
as
unable
to
explain
,
as
I
dare
say
he
would
have
be
to
assist
me
in
the
task
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
have
record
in
the
narrative
of
my
school
day
,
his
veneration
for
the
Doctor
be
unbounde
;
and
there
be
a
subtlety
of
perception
in
real
attachment
,
even
when
it
be
bear
towards
man
by
one
of
the
low
animal
,
which
leave
the
high
intellect
behind
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
mind
of
the
heart
,
if
I
may
call
it
so
,
in
Mr
Dick
,
some
bright
ray
of
the
truth
shoot
straight
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
proudly
resume
his
privilege
,
in
many
of
his
spare
hour
,
of
walk
up
and
down
the
garden
with
the
Doctor
;
as
he
have
be
accustom
to
pace
up
and
down
the
Doctor
's
Walk
at
Canterbury
.
<EOS>
but
matter
be
no
sooner
in
this
state
,
than
he
devote
all
his
spare
time
(
and
get
up
earlier
to
make
it
more
)
to
these
perambulation
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
never
be
so
happy
as
when
the
Doctor
read
that
marvellous
performance
,
the
Dictionary
,
to
him
;
he
be
now
quite
miserable
unless
the
Doctor
pull
it
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
begin
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
Doctor
and
I
be
engage
,
he
now
fall
into
the
custom
of
walk
up
and
down
with
Mrs
Strong
,
and
help
her
to
trim
her
favourite
flower
,
or
weed
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
rarely
speak
a
dozen
word
in
an
hour
:
but
his
quiet
interest
,
and
his
wistful
face
,
find
immediate
response
in
both
their
breast
<EOS>
;
each
know
that
the
other
like
him
,
and
that
he
love
both
;
and
he
become
what
no
one
else
could
be
---
a
link
between
them
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
think
of
him
,
with
his
impenetrably
wise
face
,
walk
up
and
down
with
the
Doctor
,
delight
to
be
batter
by
the
hard
word
in
the
Dictionary
;
when
I
think
of
him
carry
huge
watering
-
pot
after
Annie
;
kneel
down
,
in
very
paws
of
glove
,
at
patient
microscopic
work
among
the
little
leave
;
express
as
no
philosopher
could
have
express
,
in
everything
he
do
,
a
delicate
desire
to
be
her
friend
;
shower
sympathy
,
trustfulness
,
and
affection
,
out
of
every
hole
in
the
watering
-
pot
;
when
I
think
of
him
never
wander
in
that
well
mind
of
his
to
which
unhappiness
address
itself
,
never
bring
the
unfortunate
King
Charles
into
the
garden
,
never
waver
in
his
grateful
service
,
never
divert
from
his
knowledge
that
there
be
something
wrong
,
or
from
his
wish
to
set
it
right
<EOS>
---
I
really
feel
almost
ashamed
of
have
know
that
he
be
not
quite
in
his
wit
,
take
account
of
the
utmost
I
have
do
with
mine
.
   
<EOS>
"
nobody
but
myself
,
Trot
,
know
what
that
man
be
!
"
<EOS>
my
aunt
would
proudly
remark
,
when
we
converse
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dick
will
distinguish
himself
yet

"
   
<EOS>
I
must
refer
to
one
other
topic
before
I
close
this
chapter
.
 
<EOS>
while
the
visit
at
the
Doctor
's
be
still
in
progress
,
I
observe
that
the
postman
bring
two
or
three
letter
every
morning
for
Uriah
Heep
,
who
remain
at
Highgate
until
the
rest
go
back
,
it
be
a
leisure
time
;
and
that
these
be
always
direct
in
a
business
-
like
manner
by
Mr
Micawber
,
who
now
assume
a
round
legal
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
infer
,
from
these
slight
premise
,
that
Mr
Micawber
be
do
well
;
and
consequently
be
much
surprised
to
receive
,
about
this
time
,
the
following
letter
from
his
amiable
wife
:
---
    
"

You
will
doubtless
be
surprised
,
my
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
to
receive
this
communication
.
 
<EOS>
still
more
so
,
by
its
content
.
 
<EOS>
still
more
so
,
by
the
stipulation
of
implicit
confidence
which
I
beg
to
impose
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
feeling
as
a
wife
and
mother
require
relief
;
and
<EOS>
as
I
do
not
wish
to
consult
my
family
(
already
obnoxious
to
the
feeling
of
Mr
Micawber
)
,
I
know
no
one
of
whom
I
can
better
ask
advice
than
my
friend

former
lodger

You
may
be
aware
,
my

that
between
myself

Mr
Micawber

whom
I
will
never
desert
)
,
there
have
always
be
preserve
a
spirit
of
mutual
confidence

<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
may
have
occasionally
give
a
bill
without
consult
me
,
or
he
may
have
mislead
me
as
to
the
period
when
that
obligation
would
become
due

<EOS>
this
have
actually
happen

,
in

Mr

have
have
no

I
allude
to

invariably

on

You
will
picture
to
yourself
,
my
dear
Mr

what
the
poignancy
of
my

must
be
,
when
I
inform
you

He

He

His

if
I
should
assure
you
that
beyond
know

it
be

from
morning

I

thoughtless

He

<EOS>
He
be
estranged
from

he
have
no

he
look
with
an
eye
of
coldness

unoffending

last

the

keep
down

from
him

great

this

I
do
not

justified

that

kindness

<EOS>
another

once
again

let
me
pause
upon
a
memorable
period
of
my

<EOS>
let
me
stand
aside
,
to
see
the
phantom
of
those

accompany

in
dim
procession

week

pass
along

<EOS>
They
seem
little
more
than
a
summer
day

winter
evening

<EOS>
now
,
the
Common
where
I
walk
with
Dora
be
all
in

of
bright

and
now
the

lie
in
mound
and
bunche
underneath
a
covering
of
snow

<EOS>
in
a
breath
,
the
river
that
flow
through
our
Sunday
walk
be
sparkle
in
the
summer
sun

be

neither

we

what
I
have

I

I

out
article

It
would
be
well
for
them
to
buy
the
good
at
once

without
this
ceremony
of
inspection

for
,
when
we
go
to
see
a
kitchen
fender
and
meat

screen

Dora
see
a
chinese
house
for
Jip
,
with
little
bell
on
the
top

and
prefer
that

<EOS>
and
it
take
a
long
time
to
accustom
Jip
to
his
new
residence
,
after
we
have
buy
it
;
whenever
he
go
in
or
out

he
make
all
the
little

ring

horribly
frightened

up

and
now
it
be

that
I
begin
to
see
her
solitary
brother
pass
through
the
dark
street
at
night

and
look

as

among

I

<EOS>
It

wait
for
me
any

of
time

and
that

<EOS>
"
at

Traddles

"
I

I

to

that
this

Miss
Wickfield

demand
my
warm

<EOS>
I

sensible

<EOS>
I
hear
him
,
and
shake
hand
with
him
;
and
we
talk
,
and
walk
,
and
dine
,
and
so
on
;
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
believe
it

<EOS>
nothing

real

<EOS>
Sophy

at
the
house

Dora

aunt

in
due
course

<EOS>
She
have
the
most
agreeable

not
absolutely
beautiful

but
extraordinarily
pleasant
,

and
be
one
of
the
most
genial

unaffected

frank

engage
creature
I
have
ever

<EOS>
Traddles
present
her
to
us
with
great
pride
;
and
rub
his
hand
for
ten
minute
by
the
clock
,
with
every
individual
hair
upon
his
head
stand
on
tiptoe
,
when
I
congratulate
him
in
a
corner
on
his
choice
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
bring
agne
from
the
Canterbury
coach
,
and
her
cheerful
and
beautiful
face
be
among
us
for
the
second
time

<EOS>
Agnes
have
a
great
liking
for
Traddles
,
and
it
be
capital
to
see
them
meet
,
and
to
observe
the
glory
of
Traddles
as
he
commend
the
dear
girl
in
the
world
to
her
acquaintance
.
   
<EOS>
still
I
do
not
believe
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
a
delightful
evening
,
and
be
supremely
happy
;
but
I
do
not
believe
it
yet
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
collect
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
check
off
my
happiness
as
it
take
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
in
a
misty
and
unsettled
kind
of
state
;
as
if
I
have
get
up
very
early
in
the
morning
a
week
or
two
ago
,
and
have
never
be
to
bed
since
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
make
out
when
yesterday
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
seem
to
have
be
carry
the
licence
about
,
in
my
pocket
,
many
month
.
   
<EOS>
next
day
,
too
,
when
we
all
go
in
a
flock
to
see
the
house
---
our
house
---
Dora
's
and
mine
---
I
be
quite
unable
to
regard
myself
as
its
master
.
 
<EOS>
I
seem
to
be
there
,
by
permission
of
somebody
else
.
 
<EOS>
I
half
expect
the
real
master
to
come
home
presently
,
and
say
he
be
glad
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
beautiful
little
house
as
it
be
,
with
everything
so
bright
and
new
;
with
the
flower
on
the
carpet
look
as
if
freshly
gather
,
and
the
green
leave
on
the
paper
as
if
they
have
just
come
out
;
with
the
spotless
muslin
curtain
,
and
<EOS>
the
blush
rise
-
colour
furniture
,
and
Dora
's
garden
hat
with
the
blue
ribbon
<EOS>
---
do
I
remember
,
now
,
how
I
love
her
in
such
another
hat
when
I
first
know
her
!
---
already
hang
on
its
little
peg
;
the
guitar
-
case
quite
at
home
on
its
heel
in
a
corner
;
and
everybody
tumble
over
Jip
's
pagoda
,
which
be
much
too
big
for
the
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
another
happy
evening
,
quite
as
unreal
as
all
the
rest
of
it
,
and
I
steal
into
the
usual
room
before
go
away
.
<EOS>
Dora
be
not
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
they
have
not
do
try
on
yet
.
<EOS>
Miss
Lavinia
peep
in
,
and
tell
me
mysteriously
that
she
will
not
be
long
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
rather
long
,
notwithstanding
;
but
by
and
by
I
hear
a
rustling
at
the
door
,
and
someone
tap
.
   
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
come
in
!
"
<EOS>
but
someone
tap
again
.
   
<EOS>
I
go
to
the
door
,
wonder
who
it
be
;
there
,
I
meet
a
pair
of
bright
eye
,
and
a
blush
face
;
they
be
Dora
's
eye
and
face
,
and
Miss
Lavinia
have
dress
her
in
tomorrow
's
dress
,
bonnet
and
all
,
for
me
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
my
little
wife
to
my
heart
;
and
Miss
Lavinia
give
a
little
scream
because
I
tumble
the
bonnet
,
and
Dora
laugh
and
cry
at
once
,
because
I
be
so
pleased
;
and
I
believe
it
less
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
it
pretty
,
Doady
?
"
say
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
pretty
!
 
<EOS>
I
should
rather
think
I
do
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
be
you
sure
you
like
me
very
much
?
"
say
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
the
topic
be
fraught
with
such
danger
to
the
bonnet
,
that
Miss
Lavinia
give
another
little
scream
,
and
beg
me
to
understand
that
Dora
be
only
to
be
look
at
,
and
on
no
account
to
be
touch
.
 
<EOS>
so
Dora
stand
in
a
delightful
state
of
confusion
for
a
minute
or
two
,
to
be
admire
;
and
then
take
off
her
bonnet
---
look
so
natural
without
it
!
<EOS>
---
and
run
away
with
it
in
her
hand
;
and
come
dance
down
again
in
her
own
familiar
dress
,
and
ask
Jip
if
I
have
get
a
beautiful
little
wife
,
and
whether
he
will
forgive
her
for
be
marry
,
and
kneel
down
to
make
him
stand
upon
the
cookery
-
book
,
for
the
last
time
in
her
single
life
.
   
<EOS>
I
go
home
,
more
incredulous
than
ever
,
to
a
lodging
that
I
have
hard
by
;
and
get
up
very
early
in
the
morning
,
to
ride
to
the
Highgate
road
and
fetch
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
never
see
my
aunt
in
such
state
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
dress
in
lavender
-
colour
silk
,
and
have
a
white
bonnet
on
,
and
be
amazing
.
<EOS>
Janet
have
dress
her
,
and
be
there
to
look
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
be
ready
to
go
to
church
,
intend
to
behold
the
ceremony
from
the
gallery
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
,
who
be
to
give
my
darling
to
me
at
the
altar
,
have
have
his
hair
curl

<EOS>
Traddles
,
whom
I
have
take
up
by
appointment
at
the
turnpike
,
present
a
dazzling
combination
of
cream
colour
and
light
blue
;
and
both
he
and
Mr
Dick
have
a
general
effect
about
them
of
be
all
glove
.
   
<EOS>
no
doubt
I
see
this
,
because
I
know
it
be
so
;
but
I
be
astray
,
and
seem
to
see
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
nor
do
I
believe
anything
<EOS>
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
as
we
drive
along
in
an
open
carriage
,
this
fairy
marriage
be
real
enough
to
fill
me
with
a
sort
of
wonder
pity
for
the
unfortunate
people
who
have
no
part
in
it
,
but
be
sweep
out
the
shop
,
and
go
to
their
daily
occupation
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
sit
with
my
hand
in
hers
all
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
stop
a
little
way
short
of
the
church
,
to
put
down
Peggotty
,
whom
we
have
bring
on
the
box
,
she
give
it
a
squeeze
,
and
me
a
kiss
.
   
<EOS>
"
God

Trot

<EOS>
My

never
could

<EOS>
I

say
my

in

cordiality
to
Traddles

Mr

who
then
give
his
to

,
who
then
give
mine
to
Traddles

and
then

come
to
the
church
door
.
   
<EOS>
the
church
be
calm
enough
,
I
be
sure
;

it
may
be

full
action
,
for
any
sedative

I

the

why
pew

must
always
be
the
most

and
whether
there
be
any
religious
dread
of
a
disastrous
infection
of
good

Dora

our

Dora

and
look
back

and

,
"
if
I

ungrateful

We

I

it

<EOS>
It

my

little

"

you
do
not

"
   
I
have
stand
aside
to
see
the
phantom
of
those
day
go
by
me

<EOS>
They
be
go

I
resume
the
journey

<EOS>
Chapter
44
.
<EOS>
Our
housekeeping
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
strange
condition
of
thing
,
the
honeymoon
be
over
,
and
the
bridesmaid
go
home
,
when
I
find
myself
sit
down
in
my
own
small
house
with
Dora
;
quite
throw
out
of
employment
,
as
I
may
say
,
in
respect
of
the
delicious
old
occupation
of
make
love
.
   
<EOS>
It
seem
such
an
extraordinary
thing
to
have
Dora
always
there
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
unaccountable
not
to
be
oblige
to
go
out
to
see
her
,
not
to
have
any
occasion
to
be
torment
myself
about
her
,
not
to
have
to
write
to
her
,
not
to
be
scheme
and
devise
opportunity
of
be
alone
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
of
an
evening
,
when
I
look
up
from
my
writing
,
and
see
her
seat
opposite
,
I
would
lean
back
in
my
chair
,
and
think
how
queer
it
be
that
there
we
be
,
alone
together
as
a
matter
of
course
---
<EOS>
nobody
be
business
any
more
<EOS>
---
all
the
romance
of
our
engagement
put
away
upon
a
shelf
,
to
rust
---
<EOS>
no
one
to
please
but
one
another
---
one
another
to
please
,
for
life
.
   
<EOS>
when
there
be
a
debate
,
and
I
be
keep
out
very
late
,
it
seem
so
strange
to
me
,
as
I
be
walk
home
,
to
think
that
Dora
be
at
home
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
such
a
wonderful
thing
,
at
first
,
to
have
her
come
softly
down
to
talk
to
me
as
I
eat
my
supper
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
such
a
stupendous
thing
to
know
for
certain
that
she
put
her
hair
in
paper
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
altogether
such
an
astonishing
event
to
see
her
do
it
!
   
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
two
young
bird
could
have
know
less
about
keep
house
,
than
I
and
my
pretty
Dora
do
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
a
servant
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
She
keep
house
for
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
still
a
latent
belief
that
she
must
have
be
Mrs
Crupp
's
daughter
in
disguise
,
we
have
such
an
awful
time
of
it
with
Mary
Anne
.
   
<EOS>
Her
name
be
Paragon
.
 
<EOS>
Her
nature
be
represent
to
us
,
when
we
engage
her
,
as
be
feebly
express
in
her
name
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
a
write
character
,
as
large
as
a
proclamation
;
and
,
accord
to
this
document
,
could
do
everything
of
a
domestic
nature
that
ever
I
hear
of
,
and
a
great
many
thing
that
I
never
do
hear
of
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
woman
in
the
prime
of
life
;
of
a
severe
countenance
;
and
subject
(
particularly
in
the
arm
)
to
a
sort
of
perpetual
measle
or
fiery
rash
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
a
cousin
in
the
Life
-
Guards
,
with
such
long
leg
that
he
look
like
the
afternoon
shadow
of
somebody
else
.
<EOS>
His
shell
-
jacket
be
as
much
too
little
for
him
as
he
be
too
big
for
the
premise
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
the
cottage
small
than
it
nee
<EOS>
have
be
,
by
be
so
very
much
out
of
proportion
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
besides
which
,
the
wall
be
not
thick
,
and
,
whenever
he
pass
the
evening
at
our
house
,
we
always
know
of
it
by
hear
one
continual
growl
in
the
kitchen
.
   
<EOS>
Our
treasure
be
warrant
sober
and
honest
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
therefore
willing
to
believe
that
she
be
in
a
fit
when
we
find
her
under
the
boiler
;
and
that
the
deficient
tea
-
spoon
be
attributable
to
the
dustman
.
   
<EOS>
but
she
prey
upon
our
mind
dreadfully
.
 
<EOS>
We
feel
our
inexperience
,
and
be
unable
to
help
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
We
should
have
be
at
her
mercy
,
if
she
have
have
any
;
but
she
be
a
remorseless
woman
,
and
have
none
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
the
cause
of
our
first
little
quarrel
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
life
,
"
I
say
one
day
to
Dora
,
"
do
you
think
Mary
Anne
have
any
idea
of
time
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
Doady
?
"
inquire
Dora
,
look
up
,
innocently
,
from
her
drawing
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
love
,
because
it
be
five
,
and
we
be
to
have
dine
at
four
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Dora
glance
wistfully
at
the
clock
,
and
hint
that
she
think
it
be
too
fast
.
   
<EOS>
"
on
the
contrary
,
my
love
,
"
say
I
,
refer
to
my
watch
,
"
it
be
a
few
minute
too
slow
.
"
   
<EOS>
My
little
wife
come
and
sit
upon
my
knee
,
to
coax
me
to
be
quiet
,
and
draw
a
line
with
her
pencil
down
the
middle
of
my
nose
;
but
I
could
not
dine
off
that
,
though
it
be
very
agreeable
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
think
,
my
dear
,
"
say
I
,
"
it
would
be
well
for
you
to
remonstrate
with
Mary
Anne
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
no
,
please
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
,
Doady
!
"
say
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
not
,
my
love
?
<EOS>
"
I
gently
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
because
I
be
such
a
little
goose
,
"
say
Dora
,
"
and
she
know
I
be
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
think
this
sentiment
so
incompatible
with
the
establishment
of
any
system
of
check
on
Mary
Anne
,
that
I
frown
a
little
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
what
ugly
wrinkle
in
my
bad
boy
's
forehead
!
"
say
Dora
,
and
still
be
on
my
knee
,
she
trace
them
with
her
pencil
;
put
it
to
her
rosy
lip
to
make
it
mark
blacker
,
and
work
at
my
forehead
with
a
quaint
little
mockery
of
be
industrious
,
that
quite
delight
me
in
spite
of
myself
.
   
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
good
child

say
Dora
,
"
it
make
its
face
so
much
pretty
to
laugh

You

;
what
a
little
hand
it
be
to
hold
,
and
what
a
tiny
wedding
-
ring
it
be
to
see
!
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
my
love
,
it
be
not
exactly
comfortable
to
have
to
go
out
without
one
's
dinner

<EOS>
now
,
be
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
N
-
n
-
no

<EOS>
reply
Dora
,
faintly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
love
,
how
you
tremble
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
because
I
know
you
be
go
to
scold
me
,
"
exclaim
Dora
,
in
a
piteous
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
sweet
,
I
be
only
go
to
reason
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
but
reasoning
be
bad
than
scold
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Dora
,
in
despair
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
marry
to
be
reason
with

<EOS>
if
you
mean
to
reason
with
such
a
poor
little
thing
as
I
be
,
you
ought
to
have
tell
me
so
,
you
cruel
boy
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
try
to
pacify
Dora
,
but
she
turn
away
her
face
,
and
shake
her
curl
from
side
to
side
,
and
say
,
"
You
cruel
,
cruel
boy
!
"
<EOS>
so
many
time
,
that
I
really
do
not
exactly
know
what
to
do
:
so
I
take
a
few
turn
up
and
down
the
room
in
my
uncertainty
,
and
come
back
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dora
,
my
darling
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
be
not
your
darling
.
 
<EOS>
because
you
must
be
sorry
that
you
marry
me
,
or
else
you
would
not
reason
with
me
!
"
return
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
I
feel
so
injure
by
the
inconsequential
nature
of
this
charge
,
that
it
give
me
courage
to
be
grave
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
my
own
Dora
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
be
very
childish
,
and
be
talk
nonsense

<EOS>
You
must
remember
,
I
be
sure
,
that
I
be
oblige
to
go
out
yesterday
when
dinner
be
half
over
;
and
that
,
the
day
before
,
I
be
make
quite
unwell
by
be
oblige
to
eat
underdone
veal
in
a
hurry
;
today
,
I
do
not
dine
at
all

and
I
be
afraid
to
say
how
long
we
wait
for
breakfast
---
and
then
the
water
do
not
boil
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
reproach
you
,
my

this
be
not
comfortable
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
you
cruel
,
cruel
boy

to
say
I

a
disagreeable

cry
Dora

<EOS>
"
now
,
my
dear
Dora
,
you
must
know
that
I
never
say
that

<EOS>
"
You
say
,
I
be
not
comfortable

cry
Dora

<EOS>
"
I
say
the
housekeeping
be
not
comfortable

<EOS>
"
It
be
exactly
the
same
thing

"
<EOS>
cry
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
evidently
think
so
,
for
she
weep
most
grievously
.
   
<EOS>
I
take
another
turn
across
the
room
,
full
of
love
for
my
pretty
wife
,
and
distract
by
self
-
accusatory
inclination
to
knock
my
head
against
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
down
again
,
and
say
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
not

Dora

<EOS>
We
have
both
a
great

(
I

not

up

"
accustom

I

I

it
so
much

even
mention
that
you
buy
a

I
have
wound
Dora
's
soft
little
heart
,

she
be
not
to
be
comfort

<EOS>
She
be
so
pathetic
in
her
sobbing

bewailing

that
I
feel
as
if
I
have
say
I
do
not
know
what
to
hurt
her

<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
hurry
away
;
I
be
keep
out
late
;
and
I
feel
all
night
such
pang
of
remorse
as
make
me
miserable

<EOS>
I
have
the
conscience
of
an
assassin

be
haunt
by
a
vague
sense
of
enormous
wickedness

It
be
two

three
hour
past
midnight
when
I
get
home

I
find

up

I
lean
my

upon

soon

there

I

I

I
thank
my

in

for
her

after

further
contemplation

you
could

return
my

with
some
emotion

"
no

<EOS>
do
not
ask
me
such
a
thing

"
   
<EOS>
Her
tone
be
so
very
earnest
that
I
raise
my
eye
in
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
look
back
on
my
life
,
child
,
"
say
my
aunt
,
"
and
I
think
of
some
who
be
in
their
grave
,
with
whom
I
may
have
be
on
kind
term
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
judge
harshly
of
other
people
's
mistake
in
marriage
,
it
may
have
be
because
I
have
bitter
reason
to
judge
harshly
of
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
let
that
pass
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
a
grumpy
,
frumpy

wayward

a
good
many
year

<EOS>
I
be
still

I
always
shall

do
one
another
some
good

at

you

do
me

if
I
meddle
in
anything

a

could
not

<EOS>
I
want
our

be
as
gay

<EOS>
remember
your

both
me

<EOS>
I
comprehend
,
at

that
my

be
right

I
comprehend
the
full

a

pass
over

moment

I
think
;

you
have
choose
a
very
pretty

Heaven
bless

<EOS>
My

say
this
in

sprightly
way

give
me
a
kiss
to
ratify
the
blessing

<EOS>
"
now

say
she
,
"
light
my

lantern

me
into

whatever
you
do

never

Betsey
up

<EOS>
with
this
my
aunt
tie
her
head
up
in
a
handkerchief
,
with
which
she
be
accustomed
to
make
a
bundle
of
it
on
such
occasion

and
I
escort
her
home
.
 
<EOS>
as
she
stand
in
her
garden
,
hold
up
her
little
lantern
to
light
me
back
,
I
think
her
observation
of
me
have
an
anxious
air
again
;
but
I
be
too
much
occupy
in
ponder
on
what
she
have
say
,
and
too
much
impressed
---
for
the
first
time
,
in
reality
---
by
the
conviction
that
Dora
and
I
have
indeed
to
work
out
our
future
for
ourselves
,
and
that
no
one
could
assist
us
,
to
take
much
notice
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
Dora
come
steal
down
in
her
little
slipper
,
to
meet
me
,
now
that
I
be
alone
;
and
cry
upon
my
shoulder
,
and
say
I
have
be
hard
-
hearted
<EOS>
and
she
have
be
naughty
;
and
I
say
much
the
same
thing
in
effect
,
I
believe
;
and
we
make
it
up
,
and
agree
that
our
first
little
difference
be
to
be
our
last
,
and
that
we
be
never
to
have
another
if
we
live
a
hundred
year
.
   
<EOS>
the
next
domestic
trial
we
go
through
,
be
the
Ordeal
of
servant
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
Anne
's
cousin
desert
into
our
coal
-
hole
,
and
be
bring
out
,
to
our
great
amazement
,
by
a
piquet
of
his
companion
in
arm
,
who
take
him
away
handcuff
in
a
procession
that
cover
our
front
-
garden
with
ignominy
.
 
<EOS>
this
nerve
me
to
get
rid
of
Mary
Anne
,
who
go
so
mildly
,
on
receipt
of
wage
,
that
I
be
surprised
,
until
I
find
out
about
the
tea
-
spoon
,
and
also
about
the
little
sum
she
have
borrow
in
my
name
of
the
tradespeople
without
authority
.
 
<EOS>
after
an
interval
of
Mrs
Kidgerbury
---
the
old
inhabitant
of
Kentish
Town
,
I
believe
,
who
go
out
char
,
but
be
too
feeble
to
execute
her
conception
of
that
art
<EOS>
---
we
find
another
treasure
,
who
be
one
of
the
most
amiable
of
woman
,
but
who
generally
make
a
point
of
fall
either
up
or
down
the
kitchen
stair
with
the
tray
,
and
almost
plunge
into
the
parlour
,
as
into
a
bath
,
with
the
tea
-
thing
.
 
<EOS>
the
ravage
commit
by
this
unfortunate
,
render
her
dismissal
necessary
<EOS>
,
she
be
succeed
(
with
interval
of
Mrs
Kidgerbury
)
by
a
long
line
of
Incapables
;
terminate
in
a
young
person
of
genteel
appearance
,
who
go
to
Greenwich
Fair
in
Dora
's
bonnet
.
 
<EOS>
after
whom
I
remember
nothing
but
an
average
equality
of
failure
.
   
<EOS>
everybody
we
have
anything
to
do
with
seem
to
cheat
us
.
 
<EOS>
Our
appearance
in
a
shop
be
a
signal
for
the
damage
good
to
be
bring
out
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
if
we
buy
a
lobster
,
it
be
full
of
water
.
 
<EOS>
all
our
meat
turn
out
to
be
tough
,
and
there
be
hardly
any
crust
to
our
loaf
.
 
<EOS>
in
search
of
the
principle
on
which
joint
ought
to
be
roast
,
to
be
roast
enough
,
and
not
too
much
,
I
myself
refer
to
the
Cookery
Book
,
and
find
it
there
establish
as
the
allowance
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
every
pound
,
and
say
a
quarter
over
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
principle
always
fail
us
by
some
curious
fatality
,
and
we
never
could
hit
any
medium
between
redness
and
cinder
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
reason
to
believe
that
in
accomplish
these
failure
we
incur
a
far
great
expense
than
if
we
have
achieve
a
series
of
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
It
appear
to
me
,
on
look
over
the
tradesman
's
book
,
as
if
we
may
have
keep
the
basement
storey
pave
with
butter
,
such
be
the
extensive
scale
of
our
consumption
of
that
article
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
the
Excise
return
of
the
period
may
have
exhibit
any
increase
in
the
demand
for
pepper
;
but
if
our
performance
do
not
affect
the
market
,
I
should
say
several
family
must
have
leave
off
use
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
most
wonderful
fact
of
all
be
,
that
we
never
have
anything
in
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
as
to
the
washerwoman
pawn
the
clothe
,
and
come
in
a
state
of
penitent
intoxication
to
apologize
,
I
suppose
that
may
have
happen
several
time
to
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
also
the
chimney
on
fire
,
the
parish
engine
,
and
perjury
on
the
part
of
the
Beadle
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
apprehend
that
we
be
personally
fortunate
in
engage
a
servant
with
a
taste
for
cordial
,
who
swell
our
running
account
for
porter
at
the
public
-
house
by
such
inexplicable
item
as
"
quartern
rum
shrub
(
Mrs
C
)
"
;
"
half
-
quartern
gin
and
clove
(
Mrs
C
)
"
;
"
Glass
rum
and
peppermint
(
Mrs
C
)
"
---
the
parenthesis
always
refer
to
Dora
,
who
be
suppose
,
it
appear
on
explanation
,
to
have
imbibe
the
whole
of
these
refreshment
.
   
<EOS>
one
of
our
first
feat
in
the
housekeeping
way
be
a
little
dinner
to
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
I
meet
him
in
town
,
and
ask
him
to
walk
out
with
me
that
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
He
readily
consent
<EOS>
,
I
write
to
Dora
,
say
I
would
bring
him
home
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
pleasant
weather
,
and
on
the
road
we
make
my
domestic
happiness
the
theme
of
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
be
very
full
of
it
;
and
say
,
that
,
picture
himself
with
such
a
home
,
and
Sophy
wait
and
prepare
for
him
,
he
could
think
of
nothing
want
to
complete
his
bliss
.
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
wish
for
a
pretty
little
wife
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
table
,
but
I
certainly
could
have
wish
,
when
we
sit
down
,
for
a
little
more
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
it
be
,
but
though
there
be
only
two
of
us
,
we
be
at
once
always
cramp
for
room
,
and
yet
have
always
room
enough
to
lose
everything
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
suspect
it
may
have
be
because
nothing
have
a
place
of
its
own
,
except
Jip
's
pagoda
,
which
invariably
block
up
the
main
thoroughfare
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
present
occasion
,
Traddles
be
so
hem
in
by
the
pagoda
and
the
guitar
-
case
,
and
<EOS>
Dora
's
flower
-
painting
,
and
my
writing
-
table
,
that
I
have
serious
doubt
of
the
possibility
of
his
use
his
knife
and
fork
;
but
he
protest
,
with
his
own
good
-
humour
,
"
ocean
of
room
,
Copperfield
!
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
ocean
!
"
   
<EOS>
there
be
another
thing
I
could
have
wish
,
namely
,
that
Jip
have
never
be
encourage
to
walk
about
the
tablecloth
during
dinner
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
there
be
something
disorderly
in
his
be
there
at
all
,
even
if
he
have
not
be
in
the
habit
of
put
his
foot
in
the
salt
or
the
melt
butter
.
 
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
he
seem
to
think
he
be
introduce
expressly
to
keep
Traddles
at
bay
;
and
he
bark
at
my
old
friend
,
and
make
short
run
at
his
plate
,
with
such
undaunted
pertinacity
,
that
he
may
be
say
to
have
engross
the
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
however
,
as
I
know
how
tender
-
hearted
<EOS>
my
dear
Dora
be
,
and
how
sensitive
she
would
be
to
any
slight
upon
her
favourite
<EOS>
,
I
hint
no
objection
.
 
<EOS>
for
similar
reason
I
make
no
allusion
to
the
skirmish
plate
upon
the
floor
;
or
to
the
disreputable
appearance
of
the
castor
,
which
be
all
at
six
and
seven
,
and
look
drunk
;
or
to
the
further
blockade
of
Traddles
by
wander
vegetable
dish
and
jug
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
wonder
in
my
own
mind
,
as
I
contemplate
the
boil
leg
of
mutton
before
me
,
previous
to
carve
it
<EOS>
,
how
it
come
to
pass
that
our
joint
of
meat
be
of
such
extraordinary
shape
---
and
whether
our
butcher
contract
for
all
the
deformed
sheep
that
come
into
the
world
;
but
I
keep
my
reflection
to
myself
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
love
,
"
say
I
to
Dora
,
"
what
have
you
get
in
that
dish
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
imagine
why
Dora
have
be
make
tempt
little
face
at
me
,
as
if
she
want
to
kiss
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
oyster
,
dear
,
"
say
Dora
,
timidly
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
that
your
thought
?
<EOS>
"
say
I
,
delighted
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ye
-
yes
,
Doady
,
"
say
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
"
there
never
be
a
happy
one
!
"
<EOS>
I
exclaim
,
lay
down
the
carving
-
knife
and
fork
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
Traddles
like
so
much
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ye
<EOS>
-
yes
,
Doady
,
"
say
Dora
,
"
<EOS>
and
so
I
buy
a
beautiful
little
barrel
of
them
,
and
the
man
say
they
be
very
good
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
---
I
be
afraid
there
be
something
the
matter
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
do
not
seem
right
.
"
 
<EOS>
here
Dora
shake
her
head
,
and
diamond
twinkle
in
her
eye
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
be
only
open
in
both
shell
,
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
take
the
top
one
off
,
my
love
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
but
it
will
not
come
off
!
"
<EOS>
say
Dora
,
try
very
hard
,
and
look
very
much
distressed
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
,
Copperfield
,
"
say
Traddles
,
cheerfully
examine
the
dish
,
"
I
think
it
be
in
consequence
---
they
be
capital
oyster
,
<EOS>
but
I
think
it
be
in
consequence
---
of
their
never
have
be
open
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
never
have
be
open
;
and
we
have
no
oyster
-
knife
---
and
could
not
have
use
them
if
we
have
;
so
we
look
at
the
oyster
and
eat
the
mutton
.
 
<EOS>
at
least
we
eat
as
much
of
it
as
be
do
,
and
make
up
with
caper
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
permit
him
,
I
be
satisfied
that
Traddles
would
have
make
a
perfect
savage
of
himself
,
and
eat
a
plateful
of
raw
meat
,
to
express
enjoyment
of
the
repast
;
but
I
would
hear
of
no
such
immolation
on
the
altar
of
friendship
,
and
we
have
a
course
of
bacon
instead
;
there
happen
,
by
good
fortune
,
to
be
cold
bacon
in
the
larder
.
   
<EOS>
My
poor
little
wife
be
in
such
affliction
when
she
think
I
should
be
annoy
,
and
in
such
a
state
of
joy
when
she
find
I
be
not
,
that
the
discomfiture
I
have
subdue
,
very
soon
vanish
,
and
we
pass
a
happy
evening
;
Dora
sit
with
her
arm
on
my
chair
while
Traddles
and
I
discuss
a
glass
of
wine
,
and
take
every
opportunity
of
whisper
in
my
ear
that
it
be
so
good
of
me
not
to
be
a
cruel
,
cross
old
boy
.
 
<EOS>
by
and
by
<EOS>
she
make
tea
for
us
;
which
it
be
so
pretty
to
see
her
do
,
as
if
she
be
busy
herself
with
a
set
of
doll
's
tea
-
thing
,
that
I
be
not
particular
about
the
quality
of
the
beverage
.
 
<EOS>
then
Traddles
and
I
play
a
game
or
two
at
cribbage
;
and
Dora
singe
to
the
guitar
the
while
,
it
seem
to
me
as
if
our
courtship
and
marriage
be
a
tender
dream
of
mine
,
and
the
night
when
I
first
listen
to
her
voice
be
not
yet
over
.
   
<EOS>
when
Traddles
go
away
,
and
I
come
back
into
the
parlour
from
see
him
out
,
my
wife
plant
her
chair
close
to
mine
,
and
sit
down
by
my
side
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
sorry
,
"
she
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
try
to
teach
me
,
Doady
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
teach
myself
first
,
Dora
,
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
as
bad
as
you
,
love
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
ah
!
 
<EOS>
but
you
can
learn
,
"
she
return
;
"
<EOS>
and
you
be
a
clever
,
clever
man
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
nonsense
,
mouse

<EOS>
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
"
resume
my
wife
,
after
a
long
silence
,
"
that
I
could
have
go
down
into
the
country
for
a
whole
year
,
and
live
with
Agnes
!
"
   
<EOS>
Her
hand
be
clasp
upon
my
shoulder
,
and
her
chin
rest
on
them
,
and
her
blue
eye
look
quietly
into
mine
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
why
so
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
may
have
improve
me
,
and
I
think
I
may
have
learn
from
her
,
"
say
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
"
all
in
good
time
,
my
love
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
have
have
her
father
to
take
care
of
for
these
many
year
,
you
should
remember
.
 
<EOS>
even
when
she
be
quite
a
child
,
she
be
the
Agnes
whom
we
know
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
call
me
a
name
I
want
you
to
call
me
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
Dora
,
without
move
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
with
a
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
stupid
name
,
"
she
say
,
shake
her
curl
for
a
moment
.
"
<EOS>
child
-
wife
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
laughingly
ask
my
child
-
wife
what
<EOS>
her
fancy
be
in
desire
to
be
so
call
.
 
<EOS>
She
answer
without
move
,
otherwise
than
as
the
arm
I
twine
about
her
may
have
bring
her
blue
eye
nearer
to
me
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
,
you
silly
fellow
,
that
you
should
use
the
name
instead
of
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
mean
that
you
should
think
of
me
that
way
.
<EOS>
when
you
be
go
to
be
angry
with
me
,
say
to
yourself
,
"
it
be
only
my
child
-
wife
!
"
<EOS>
when
I
be
very
disappointing
,
say
,
"
I
know
,
a
long
time
ago
,
that
she
would
make
but
a
child
-
wife
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
when
you
miss
what
I
should
like
to
be
,
and
I
think
can
never
be
,
say
,
"
still
my
foolish
child
-
wife
love
me
!
"
<EOS>
for
indeed
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
have
not
be
serious
with
her
;
have
no
idea
until
now
,
that
she
be
serious
herself
.
 
<EOS>
but
her
affectionate
nature
be
so
happy
in
what
I
now
say
to
her
with
my
whole
heart
,
that
her
face
become
a
laugh
one
before
her
glitter
eye
be
dry
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
soon
my
child
-
wife
indeed
;
sit
down
on
the
floor
outside
the
Chinese
House
,
ring
all
the
little
bell
one
after
another
,
to
punish
Jip
for
his
recent
bad
behaviour
;
while
Jip
lie
blink
in
the
doorway
with
his
head
out
,
even
too
lazy
to
be
tease
.
   
<EOS>
this
appeal
of
Dora
's
make
a
strong
impression
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
back
on
the
time
I
write
of
;
I
invoke
the
innocent
figure
that
I
dearly
love
,
to
come
out
from
the
mist
and
shadow
of
the
past
,
and
turn
its
gentle
head
towards
me
once
again
;
and
I
can
still
declare
that
this
one
little
speech
be
constantly
in
my
memory
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
not
have
use
it
to
the
good
account
;
I
be
young
and
inexperienced
;
but
I
never
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
its
artless
pleading
.
   
<EOS>
Dora
tell
me
,
shortly
afterwards
,
that
she
be
go
to
be
a
wonderful
housekeeper
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
she
polish
the
tablet
,
point
the
pencil
,
buy
an
immense
account
-
book
,
carefully
stitch
up
with
a
needle
and
thread
all
the
leave
of
the
Cookery
Book
which
Jip
have
tear
,
and
make
quite
a
desperate
little
attempt
"
to
be
good
"
,
as
she
call
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
figure
have
the
old
obstinate
propensity
---
they
WOULD
not
add
up
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
have
enter
two
or
three
laborious
item
in
the
account
-
book
,
Jip
would
walk
over
the
page
,
wag
his
tail
,
and
smear
them
all
out
.
 
<EOS>
Her
own
little
right
-
hand
middle
finger
get
steep
to
the
very
bone
in
ink
;
and
I
think
that
be
the
only
decide
result
obtain
.
   
<EOS>
sometimes
,
of
an
evening
,
when
I
be
at
home
and
at
work
---
for
I
write
a
good
deal
now
,
and
be
begin
in
a
small
way
to
be
know
as
a
writer
---
I
would
lay
down
my
pen
,
and
watch
my
child
-
wife
try
to
be
good
.
 
<EOS>
first
of
all
,
she
would
bring
out
the
immense
account
-
book
,
and
lie
it
down
upon
the
table
,
with
a
deep
sigh
.
<EOS>
then
she
would
open
it
at
the
place
where
Jip
have
make
it
illegible
last
night
,
and
call
Jip
up
,
to
look
at
his
misdeed
.
 
<EOS>
this
would
occasion
a
diversion
in
Jip
's
favour
,
and
some
inking
of
his
nose
,
perhaps
,
as
a
penalty
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
would
tell
Jip
to
lie
down
on
the
table
instantly
,
"
like
a
lion
"
---
which
be
one
of
his
trick
,
though
I
can
not
say
the
likeness
be
strike
---
and
,
if
he
be
in
an
obedient
humour
,
he
would
obey
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
would
take
up
a
pen
,
and
begin
to
write
,
and
find
a
hair
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
would
take
up
another
pen
,
and
begin
to
write
,
and
find
that
it
splutter
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
would
take
up
another
pen
,
and
begin
to
write
,
and
say
in
a
low
voice
,
"
oh
,
it
be
a
talking
pen
,
and
will
disturb
Doady
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
she
would
give
it
up
as
a
bad
job
,
and
put
the
account
-
book
away
,
after
pretend
to
crush
the
lion
with
it
.
   
<EOS>
or
,
if
she
be
in
a
very
sedate
and
serious
state
of
mind
,
she
would
sit
down
with
the
tablet
,
and
a
little
basket
of
bill
and
other
document
,
which
look
more
like
curl
-
paper
than
anything
else
,
and
endeavour
to
get
some
result
out
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
after
severely
compare
one
with
another
,
and
make
entry
on
the
tablet
,
and
blot
them
out
,
and
count
all
the
finger
of
her
left
hand
over
and
over
again
,
backwards
and
forwards
,
she
would
be
so
vexed
and
discourage
,
and
would
look
so
unhappy
,
that
it
give
me
pain
to
see
her
bright
face
clouded
---
and
for
me
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
I
would
go
softly
to
her
,
and
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
what
be
the
matter
,
Dora
?
"
   
<EOS>
Dora
would
look
up
hopelessly
,
and
reply
,
"
They
will
not
come
right
.
<EOS>
They
make
my
head
ache
so
.
 
<EOS>
and
they
will
not
do
anything
I
want
!
"
   
<EOS>
then
I
would
say
,
"
now
let
us
try
together
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
show
you
,
Dora
.
"
   
<EOS>
then
I
would
commence
a
practical
demonstration
,
to
which
Dora
would
pay
profound
attention
,
perhaps
for
five
minute
;
when
she
would
begin
to
be
dreadfully
tired
,
and
would
lighten
the
subject
by
curl
my
hair
,
or
try
the
effect
of
my
face
with
my
shirt
-
collar
turn
down
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
tacitly
check
this
playfulness
,
and
persist
,
she
would
look
so
scared
and
disconsolate
,
as
she
become
more
and
more
bewildered
,
that
the
remembrance
of
her
natural
gaiety
when
I
first
stray
into
her
path
,
and
of
her
be
my
child
-
wife
,
would
come
reproachfully
upon
me
;
and
I
would
lay
the
pencil
down
,
and
call
for
the
guitar
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
deal
of
work
to
do
,
and
have
many
anxiety
,
but
the
same
consideration
make
me
keep
them
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
far
from
sure
,
now
,
that
it
be
right
to
do
this
,
but
I
do
it
for
my
child
-
wife
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
I
search
my
breast
,
and
I
commit
its
secret
,
if
I
know
them
,
without
any
reservation
to
this
paper
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
unhappy
loss
or
want
of
something
have
,
I
be
conscious
,
some
place
in
my
heart
;
but
not
to
the
embitterment
of
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
walk
alone
in
the
fine
weather
,
and
think
of
the
summer
day
when
all
the
air
have
be
fill
with
my
boyish
enchantment
,
I
do
miss
something
of
the
realization
of
my
dream
;
but
I
think
it
be
a
soften
glory
of
the
Past
,
which
nothing
could
have
throw
upon
the
present
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
feel
,
sometimes
,
for
a
little
while
,
that
I
could
have
wish
my
wife
have
be
my
counsellor
;
have
have
more
character
and
purpose
,
to
sustain
me
and
improve
me
by
;
have
be
endow
with
power
to
fill
up
the
void
which
somewhere
seem
to
be
about
me
;
but
I
feel
as
if
this
be
an
unearthly
consummation
of
my
happiness
,
that
never
have
be
mean
to
be
,
and
never
could
have
be
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
a
boyish
husband
as
to
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
know
the
softening
influence
of
no
other
sorrow
or
experience
than
those
record
in
these
leave
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
do
any
wrong
,
as
I
may
have
do
much
,
I
do
it
in
mistaken
love
,
and
in
my
want
of
wisdom
.
 
<EOS>
I
write
the
exact
truth
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
avail
me
nothing
to
extenuate
it
now
.
   
<EOS>
thus
it
be
that
I
take
upon
myself
the
toil
and
care
of
our
life
,
and
have
no
partner
in
them
.
 
<EOS>
We
live
much
as
before
,
in
reference
to
our
scramble
household
arrangement
;
but
I
have
get
use
to
those
,
and
Dora
<EOS>
I
be
pleased
to
see
be
seldom
vexed
now
.
<EOS>
She
be
bright
and
cheerful
in
the
old
childish
way
,
love
me
dearly
,
and
be
happy
with
her
old
trifle
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
debate
be
heavy
---
I
mean
as
to
length
,
not
quality
,
for
in
the
last
respect
they
be
not
often
otherwise
---
and
I
go
home
late
,
Dora
would
never
rest
when
she
hear
my
footstep
,
but
would
always
come
downstairs
to
meet
me
.
 
<EOS>
when
my
evening
be
unoccupied
by
the
pursuit
for
which
I
have
qualify
myself
with
so
much
pain
,
and
I
be
engage
in
write
at
home
,
she
would
sit
quietly
near
me
,
however
late
the
hour
,
and
be
so
mute
,
<EOS>
that
I
would
often
think
she
have
drop
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
but
generally
,
when
I
raise
my
head
,
I
see
her
blue
eye
look
at
me
with
the
quiet
attention
of
which
I
have
already
speak
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
what
a
weary
boy
!
"
say
Dora
one
night
,
when
I
meet
her
eye
as
I
be
shut
up
my
desk
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
a
weary
girl
!
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
more
to
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
go
to
bed
another
time
,
my
love
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
far
too
late
for
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
do
not
send
me
to
bed
!
"
<EOS>
plead
Dora
,
come
to
my
side
.
<EOS>
"
pray
,
do
not
do
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dora
!
"
<EOS>
to
my
amazement
she
be
sob
on
my
neck
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
well
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
not
happy
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
quite
well
,
and
very
happy
!
<EOS>
"
say
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
say
you
will
let
me
stop
,
and
see
you
write
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
what
a
sight
for
such
bright
eye

<EOS>
"
I
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
they
bright
,
though
?
"
<EOS>
return
Dora
,
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
glad
they
be
bright
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
little
vanity
!
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
vanity
;
it
be
only
harmless
delight
in
my
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
very
well
,
before
she
tell
me
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
you
think
them
pretty
,
say
I
may
always
stop
,
and
see
you
write
!
"
say
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
them
pretty
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
very
pretty
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
then
let
me
always
stop
and
see
you
write
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
that
will
not
improve
their
brightness
,
Dora
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
it
will
!
 
<EOS>
because
,
you
clever
boy
,
you
will
not
forget
me
then
,
while
you
be
full
of
silent
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
mind
it
,
if
I
say
something
very
,
very
silly
?
 
<EOS>
---
more
than
usual
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
Dora
,
peep
over
my
shoulder
into
my
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
wonderful
thing
be
that
?
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
please
let
me
hold
the
pen
,
"
say
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
have
something
to
do
with
all
those
many
hour
when
you
be
so
industrious
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
hold
the
pen
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
remembrance
of
her
pretty
joy
when
I
say
yes
,
bring
tear
into
my
eye
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
time
I
sit
down
to
write
,
and
regularly
afterwards
,
she
sit
in
her
old
place
,
with
a
spare
bundle
of
pen
at
her
side
.
 
<EOS>
Her
triumph
in
this
connexion
with
my
work
,
and
her
delight
when
I
want
a
new
pen
---
which
I
very
often
feign
to
do
---
suggest
to
me
a
new
way
of
please
my
child
-
wife
.
 
<EOS>
I
occasionally
make
a
pretence
of
want
a
page
or
two
of
manuscript
copy
.
 
<EOS>
then
Dora
be
in
her
glory
.
 
<EOS>
the
preparation
she
make
for
this
great
work
,
the
apron
she
put
on
,
the
bibs
she
borrow
from
the
kitchen
to
keep
off
the
ink
,
the
time
she
take
,
the
innumerable
stoppage
she
make
to
have
a
laugh
with
Jip
as
if
he
understand
it
all
,
her
conviction
that
her
work
be
incomplete
unless
she
sign
her
name
at
the
end
,
and
the
way
in
which
she
would
bring
it
to
me
,
like
a
school
-
copy
,
and
then
,
when
I
praise
it
,
clasp
me
round
the
neck
,
be
touch
recollection
to
me
,
simple
as
they
may
appear
to
other
man
.
   
<EOS>
She
take
possession
of
the
key
soon
after
this
,
and
go
jingle
about
the
house
with
the
whole
bunch
in
a
little
basket
,
tie
to
her
slender
waist
.
 
<EOS>
I
seldom
find
that
the
place
to
which
they
belong
be
lock
,
or
that
they
be
of
any
use
except
as
a
plaything
for
Jip
---
but
Dora
be
pleased
,
and
that
please
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
quite
satisfied
that
a
good
deal
be
effect
by
this
make
-
belief
of
housekeeping
;
and
be
as
merry
as
if
we
have
be
keep
a
baby
-
house
,
for
a
joke
.
   
<EOS>
so
we
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
Dora
be
hardly
less
affectionate
to
my
aunt
than
to
me
,
and
often
tell
her
of
the
time
when
she
be
afraid
she
be
"
a
cross
old
thing
"
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
my
aunt
unbend
more
systematically
to
anyone
.
 
<EOS>
She
court
Jip
,
though
Jip
never
respond
;
listen
,
day
after
day
,
to
the
guitar
,
though
I
be
afraid
she
have
no
taste
for
music
;
never
attack
the
Incapables
,
though
the
temptation
must
have
be
severe
;
go
wonderful
distance
on
foot
to
purchase
,
as
surprise
,
any
trifle
that
she
find
out
Dora
want
;
and
never
come
in
by
the
garden
,
and
miss
her
from
the
room
,
but
she
would
call
out
,
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
,
in
a
voice
that
sound
cheerfully
all
over
the
house
:

Chapter
45
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
fulfil
my
aunt
's
prediction
 
<EOS>
It
be
some
time
now
,
since
I
have
leave
the
Doctor
.
 
<EOS>
live
in
his
neighbourhood
,
I
see
him
frequently
;
and
we
all
go
to
his
house
on
two
or
three
occasion
to
dinner
or
tea
.
 
<EOS>
the
Old
Soldier
be
in
permanent
quarter
under
the
Doctor
's
roof
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
exactly
the
same
as
ever
,
and
the
same
immortal
butterfly
hover
over
her
cap
.
   
<EOS>
like
some
other
mother
,
whom
I
have
know
in
the
course
of
my
life
,
Mrs
Markleham
be
far
more
fond
of
pleasure
than
her
daughter
be
.
 
<EOS>
She
require
a
great
deal
of
amusement
,
and
,
like
a
deep
old
soldier
,
pretend
,
in
consult
her
own
inclination
,
to
be
devote
herself
to
her
child
.
 
<EOS>
the
Doctor
's
desire
that
Annie
should
be
entertain
,
be
therefore
particularly
acceptable
to
this
excellent
parent
;
who
express
unqualified
approval
of
his
discretion
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
,
indeed
,
that
she
probe
the
Doctor
's
wound
without
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
mean
nothing
but
a
certain
matured
frivolity
and
selfishness
,
not
always
inseparable
from
full
-
blow
year
<EOS>
,
I
think
she
confirm
him
in
his
fear
that
he
be
a
constraint
upon
his
young
wife
,
and
that
there
be
no
congeniality
of
feeling
between
them
,
by
so
strongly
commend
his
design
of
lighten
the
load
of
her
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
soul
,
"
she
say
to
him
one
day
when
I
be
present
,
"
you
know
there
be
no
doubt
it
would
be
a
little
pokey
for
Annie
to
be
always
shut
up
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
Doctor
nod
his
benevolent
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
when
she
come
to
her
mother
's
age
,
"
say
Mrs
Markleham
,
with
a
flourish
of
her
fan
,
"
then
it
will
be
another
thing
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
put
me
into
a
jail
,
with
genteel
society
and
a
rubber
,
and
I
should
never
care
to
come
out
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
Annie
,
you
know
;
and
Annie
be
not
her
mother
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
surely
,
surely
,
"
say
the
Doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
the
good
of
creature
---
<EOS>
no
,
I
beg
your
pardon
!
"
<EOS>
for
the
Doctor
make
a
gesture
of
deprecation
,
"
I
must
say
before
your
face
,
as
I
always
say
behind
your
back
,
you
be
the
good
of
creature
;
but
of
course
you
do
not
---
now
do
you
?
 
<EOS>
---
enter
into
the
same
pursuit
and
fancy
as
Annie
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
the
Doctor
,
in
a
sorrowful
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
of
course
not
,
"
retort
the
Old
Soldier
.
 
<EOS>
"
take
your
dictionary
,
for
example
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
useful
work
a
Dictionary
be
!
 
<EOS>
what
a
necessary
work
!
 
<EOS>
the
meaning
of
word

<EOS>
without
Doctor
Johnson
,
or
somebody
of
that
sort
,
we
may
have
be
at
this
present
moment
call
an
italian

iron
,
a

<EOS>
but
we
can
not
expect
a
Dictionary
---
especially
when
it
be
make
---
to
interest
Annie

can
we
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
Doctor
shake
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
that
be
why
I
so
much
approve
,
"
say
Mrs
Markleham
,
tap
him
on
the
shoulder
with
her
shut
-
up
fan
,
"
of
your
thoughtfulness
.
<EOS>
It
show
that
you
do
not
expect
,
as
many
elderly
people
do
expect
,
old
head
on
young
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
study
Annie
's
character
,
and
you
understand
it
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
what
I
find
so
charming
!
"
   
<EOS>
even
the
calm
and
patient
face
of
Doctor
Strong
express
some
little
sense
of
pain
,
I
think
,
under
the
infliction
of
these
compliment
.
   
<EOS>
"
therefore
,
my
dear
doctor
,
"
say
the
Old
Soldier
,
give
him
several
affectionate
tap
,
"
you
may
command
me
,
at
all
time
and
season
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
do
understand
that
I
be
entirely
at
your
service
.
<EOS>
I
be
ready
to
go
with
Annie
to
opera
,
concert
,
exhibition
,
all
kind
of
place
;
and
you
shall
never
find
that
I
be
tired

<EOS>
Duty
,
my
dear
Doctor
,
before
every
consideration
in
the
universe
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
be
as
good
as
her
word
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
one
of
those
people
who
can
bear
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
,
and
she
never
flinch
in
her
perseverance
in
the
cause
.
 
<EOS>
She
seldom
get
hold
of
the
newspaper
(
which
she
settle
herself
down
in
the
soft
chair
in
the
house
to
read
through
an
eye
-
glass
,
every
day
,
for
two
hour
)
,
but
she
find
out
something
that
she
be
certain
<EOS>
Annie
would
like
to
see
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
for
Annie
to
protest
that
she
be
weary
of
such
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Her
mother
's
remonstrance
always
be
,
"
now
,
my
dear
Annie
,
I
be
sure
you
know
better
;
and
I
must
tell
you
,
my
love
,
that
you
be
not
make
a
proper
return
for
the
kindness
of
Doctor
Strong
.
"
   
<EOS>
this
be
usually
say
in
the
Doctor
's
presence
,
and
appear
to
me
to
constitute
Annie
's
principal
inducement
for
withdraw
her
objection
when
she
make
any
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
general
she
resign
herself
to
her
mother
,
and
go
where
the
Old
Soldier
would
.
   
<EOS>
It
rarely
happen
now
that
Mr
Maldon
accompany
them
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
my
aunt
and
Dora
be
invite
to
do
so
,
and
accept
the
invitation
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
Dora
only
be
ask
.
 
<EOS>
the
time
have
be
,
when
I
should
have
be
uneasy
in
her
go
;
but
reflection
on
what
have
pass
that
former
night
in
the
Doctor
's
study
,
have
make
a
change
in
my
mistrust
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
that
the
Doctor
be
right
,
and
I
have
no
bad
suspicion
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
rub
her
nose
sometimes
when
she
happen
to
be
alone
with
me
,
and
say
she
could
not
make
it
out
;
she
wish
they
be
happy
;
she
do
not
think
our
military
friend
(
so
she
always
call
the
Old
Soldier
)
<EOS>
mend
the
matter
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
further
express
her
opinion
,
"
that
if
our
military
friend
would
cut
off
those
butterfly
,
and
give
'em
to
the
chimney
-
sweeper
for
May
-
day
,
it
would
look
like
the
beginning
of
something
sensible
on
her
part
.
"
   
<EOS>
but
her
abide
reliance
be
on
Mr
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
that
man
have
evidently
an
idea
in
his
head
,
she
say
;
and
if
he
could
only
once
pen
it
up
into
a
corner
,
which
be
his
great
difficulty
,
he
would
distinguish
himself
in
some
extraordinary
manner
.
   
<EOS>
unconscious
of
this
prediction
,
Mr
Dick
continue
to
occupy
precisely
the
same
ground
in
reference
to
the
Doctor
and
to
Mrs
Strong
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
neither
to
advance
nor
to
recede
.
 
<EOS>
He
appear
to
have
settle
into
his
original
foundation
,
like
a
building
;
and
I
must
confess
that
my
faith
in
his
ever
Moving
,
be
not
much
great
than
if
he
have
be
a
building
.
   
<EOS>
but
one
night
,
when
I
have
be
marry
some
month
,
Mr
Dick
put
his
head
into
the
parlour
,
where
I
be
write
alone
<EOS>
(
Dora
have
go
out
with
my
aunt
to
take
tea
with
the
two
little
bird
)
,
and
say
,
with
a
significant
cough
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
could
not
speak
to
me
without
inconvenience
yourself
,
Trotwood
,
I
be
afraid
?

<EOS>

certainly
,
Mr
Dick

say
I
;
"
come
in
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Trotwood
,

say
Mr
Dick
,
lay
his
finger
on
the
side
of
his
nose
,
after
he
have
shake
hand
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
before
I
sit
down
,
I
wish
to
make
an
observation
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
your
aunt

<EOS>
"
a
little
,

I
reply
.
   
<EOS>

<EOS>
She
be
the
most
wonderful
woman
in

<EOS>
after
the
delivery
of
this
communication
,
which
he
shoot
out
of
himself
as
if
he
be
load
with
it
,
Mr
Dick
sit
down
with
great
gravity
than
usual
,
and
look
at
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
now

boy

say
Mr
Dick
,

I
be
go
to
put
a
question
to
you

as
many
as

I.

ask
Mr

fold
his

Mr

laughing

reach
across
in
high
glee

with
a
word

<EOS>
It
be
fortunate
he

proceed
so
far

we

the

bring

<EOS>
all
right

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
not
another
word
do
Mr
Dick
utter
on
the
subject
;
but
he
make
a
very
telegraph
of
himself
for
the
next
half
-
hour
(
to
the
great
disturbance
of
my
aunt
's
mind
)
,
to
enjoin
inviolable
secrecy
on
me
.
   
<EOS>
to
my
surprise
,
I
hear
no
more
about
it
for
some
two
or
three
week
,
though
I
be
sufficiently
interested
in
the
result
of
his
endeavour
;
descry
a
strange
gleam
of
good
sense
---
I
say
nothing
of
good
feeling
,
for
that
he
always
exhibit
---
in
the
conclusion
to
which
he
have
come
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
I
begin
to
believe
,
that
,
in
the
flighty
and
unsettled
state
of
his
mind
,
he
have
either
forget
his
intention
or
abandon
it
.
   
<EOS>
one
fair
evening
,
when
Dora
be
not
inclined
to
go
out
,
my
aunt
and
I
stroll
up
to
the
Doctor
's
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
autumn
,
when
there
be
no
debate
to
vex
the
evening
air
;
and
I
remember
how
the
leave
smell
like
our
garden
at
Blunderstone
as
we
tread
them
under
foot
,
and
how
the
old
,
unhappy
feeling
,
seem
to
go
by
,
on
the
sighing
wind
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
twilight
when
we
reach
the
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Strong
be
just
come
out
of
the
garden
,
where
Mr

yet
linger

busy
with
his

help
the
gardener
to
point
some
stake

<EOS>
the
Doctor
be
engage
with
someone
in
his
study
;
but
the
visitor
would
be
go
directly
,
Mrs
Strong
say
,
and
beg
us
to
remain
and
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
We
go
into
the
drawing
-
room
with
her
,
and
sit
down
by
the
darkening
window
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
never
any
ceremony
about
the
visit
of
such
old
friend
and
neighbour
as
we
be

<EOS>
We
have
not
sit
here
many
minute
,
when
Mrs
Markleham
,
who
usually
contrive
to
be
in
a
fuss
about
something
,
come
bustle
in
,
with
her
newspaper
in
her
hand

out
of
breath

"

Her

quickly

Mrs

<EOS>
perhaps
you
know

Miss
Trotwood
,
that
there

never

light
in
this
house
,
until
one
's
eye
be
literally
fall
out
of
one

head
with
be
stretch

and
that
there

can
be
what
I
call

read
,
except
one
in

<EOS>
this
take
me
to
the
Study

where
I
see
a
light

<EOS>
I
open
the
door

<EOS>
in
company

Doctor

two
professional

evidently
connect
with

three
standing
at

of

professional

give
her
all
unconditionally

<EOS>
upon
that
,
with
the
natural

fall
over

time

It
only
show
how
right

I

to
Annie

when
Doctor

pay
a

flattering
visit

make
her
the

a
declaration

listen

pray
come

"
   
<EOS>
I
be
conscious
of
Mr
Dick
's
standing
in
the
shadow
of
the
room
,
shut
up
his
knife
,
when
we
accompany
her
to
the
study
;
and
of
my
aunt
's
rub
her
nose
violently
,
by
the
way
,
as
a
mild
vent
for
her
intolerance
of
our
military
friend
;
but
who
get
first
into
the
Study
,
or
how
Mrs
Markleham
settle
herself
in
a
moment
in
her
easy
-
chair
,
or
how
my
aunt
and
I
come
to
be
leave
together
near
the
door
(
unless
her
eye
be
quick
than
mine
,
and
she
hold
me
back
)
<EOS>
,
I
have
forget
,
if
I
ever
know
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
I
know
,
---
that
we
see
the
doctor
before
he
see
us
,
sit
at
his
table
,
among
the
folio
volume
in
which
he
delight
,
rest
his
head
calmly
on
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
in
the
same
moment
,
we
see
Mrs
Strong
glide
in
,
pale
and
tremble
.
 
<EOS>
that
Mr
Dick
support
her
on
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
lay
his
other
hand
upon
the
Doctor
's
arm
,
cause
him
to
look
up
with
an
abstract
air
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
as
the
Doctor
move
his
head
,
his
wife
drop
down
on
one
knee
at
his
foot
,
and
,
with
her
hand
imploringly
lift
,
fix
upon
his
face
the
memorable
look
I
have
never
forget
.
 
<EOS>
that
at
this
sight
Mrs
Markleham
drop
the
newspaper
,
and
stare
more
like
a
figure
-
head
intend
for
a
ship
to
be
call
the
Astonishment
,
than
anything
else
I
can
think
of
.
   
<EOS>
the
gentleness
of
the
Doctor
's
manner
and
surprise
,
the
dignity
that
mingle
with
the
supplicate
attitude
of
his
wife
,
the
amiable
concern
of
Mr
Dick
,
and
the
earnestness
with
which
my
aunt

I
see
a
double
meaning
,
then
,
in
Mr
Wickfield
's
scrutiny
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
perceive
,
for
the
first
time

the
dark
suspicion

shadow
my

and
when
I
come
to
you

that
night
,
to
lay
down
all
my
load
of
shame
and
grief
,
and
know
that
I
have
to
tell
that
,
underneath
your

one
of

you

Mrs
Markleham
,
with
a
short
groan
,
lean
back
in
her
easy

chair
;
and
retire
behind
her
fan
,
as
if
she
be
never

out
any

<EOS>
"
I
have
never

in
your

interchange
a
word
with
him

time

year
have
pass

the
kindness
you
have
secretly
do
for

advancement

then
disclose
to

for
my
surprise

aggravation

<EOS>
She
sink
down
gently
at
the
Doctor
's
foot
,
though
he
do
his
utmost
to
prevent
her
;
and
say
,
look
up
,
tearfully
,
into
his
face
:
   
<EOS>
"
do
not
speak
to
me
yet
!
 
<EOS>
let
me
say
a
little
more
!
 
<EOS>
right
or
wrong
,
if
this
be
to
be
do
again
,
I
think
I
should
do
just
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
You
never
can
know
what
it
be
to
be
devoted
to
you
,
with
those
old
association
;
to
find
that
anyone
could
be
so
hard
as
to
suppose
that
the
truth
of
my
heart
be
barter
away
,
and
to
be
surround
by
appearance
confirm
that
belief

<EOS>
I
be
very
young

have
no
adviser

<EOS>
between
mama

me
,
in
all
relate
to
you

there
be
a
wide
division

<EOS>
if
I
shrink
into
myself
,
hide
the
disrespect
I
have
undergo
,
it
be
because
I
honour
you
so
much
,

so
much
wish
that
you
should
honour
me

<EOS>
"
a
little
more
!
<EOS>
a
very
few
word
more
!
 
<EOS>
I
use
to
think
there
be
so
many
whom
you
may
have
marry
,
who
would
not
have
bring
such
charge
and
trouble
on
you
,
and
who
would
have
make
your
home
a
worthy
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
use
to
be
afraid
that
I
have
better
have
remain
your
pupil
,
and
almost
your
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
use
to
fear
that
I
be
so
unsuited
to
your
learning
and
wisdom
.
 
<EOS>
if
all
this
make
me
shrink
within
myself
(
as
indeed
it
do
)
,
when
I
have
that
to
tell
,
it
be
still
because
I
honour
you
so
much
,
and
hope
that
you
may
one
day
honour
me

can
have
but
<EOS>
one
long

another
word

<EOS>
I
afterwards
mean

steadfastly
mean
,
and
purpose
to
myself

to
bear
the
whole
weight
of
know
the
unworthiness
of

you

and
now
a
last
word
,
dearest

good
of

<EOS>
the
cause
of
the
late
change
in
you
,
which
I
have
see
with
so
much
pain

sorrow

have
sometimes
refer
to
my
old
apprehension

at
other

near

be
make
clear
tonight

by
an
accident
I

also
come

tonight

the
full
measure
of
your

trust
in

<EOS>
I
do
not
hope
that
any
love
and
duty
I
may
render
in
return
,
will
ever
make
me
worthy
of
your
priceless
confidence
;
but
with
all
this
knowledge
fresh
upon
me
,
I
can
lift
my
eye
to
this

revere
as

She

her

in

gravely
up

without
at
all

herself

give
him
a

it

very
fortunate

with

I
be
confident
that
I
detect
him
at

stand
on

<EOS>
intelligence
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
be
marry
,
if
I
may
trust
to
my
imperfect
memory
for
date
,
about
a
year
or
so
,
when
one
evening
,
as
I
be
return
from
a
solitary
walk
,
thinking
of
the
book
I
be
then
write
---
for
my
success
have
steadily
increase
with
my
steady
application
,
and
I
be
engage
at
that
time
upon
my
first
work
of
fiction
---
<EOS>
I
come
past
Mrs
Steerforth
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
pass
it
before
,
during
my
residence
in
that
neighbourhood
,
though
never
when
I
could
choose
another
road
.
 
<EOS>
Howbeit
,
it
do
sometimes
happen
that
it
be
not
easy
to
find
another
,
without
make
a
long
circuit
;
and
so
I
have
pass
that
way
,
upon
the
whole
,
pretty
often
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
never
do
more
than
glance
at
the
house
,
as
I
go
by
with
a
quicken
step
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
uniformly
gloomy
and
dull
.
 
<EOS>
none
of
the
good
room
abut
on
the
road
;
and
the
narrow
,
heavily
-
frame
old
-
fashioned
window
,
never
cheerful
under
any
circumstance
,
look
very
dismal
,
close
shut
,
and
with
their
blind
always
draw
down
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
covered
way
across
a
little
paved
court
,
to
an
entrance
that
be
never
use
;
and
there
be
one
round
staircase
window
,
at
odd
with
all
the
rest
,
and
<EOS>
the
only
one
unshade
by
a
blind
,
which
have
the
same
unoccupied
blank
look
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
that
I
ever
see
a
light
in
all
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
a
casual
passer
-
by
,
I
should
have
probably
suppose
that
some
childless
person
lie
dead
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
happily
possess
no
knowledge
of
the
place
,
and
have
see
it
often
in
that
changeless
state
,
I
should
have
please
my
fancy
with
many
ingenious
speculation
,
I
dare
say
.
   
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
I
think
as
little
of
it
as
I
may
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
mind
could
not
go
by
it
and
leave
it
,
as
my
body
do
;
and
it
usually
awaken
a
long
train
of
meditation
.
 
<EOS>
come
before
me
,
on
this
particular
evening
that
I
mention
,
mingle
with
the
childish
recollection
and
later
fancy
,
the
ghost
of
half
-
form
hope
,
the
broken
shadow
of
disappointment
dimly
see
and
understand
,
the
blending
of
experience
and
imagination
,
incidental
to
the
occupation
with
which
my
thought
have
be
busy
,
it
be
more
than
commonly
suggestive
.
<EOS>
I
fall
into
a
brown
study
as
I
walk
on
,
and
a
voice
at
my
side
make
me
start
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
woman
's
voice
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
long
in
recollect
Mrs
Steerforth
's
little
parlour
-
maid
,
who
have
formerly
wear
blue
ribbon
in
her
cap
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
take
them
out
now
,
to
adapt
herself
,
I
suppose
,
to
the
alter
character
of
the
house
;
and
wear
but
one
or
two
disconsolate
bow
of
sober
brown
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
you
please
,
sir
,
would
you
have
the
goodness
to
walk
in
,
and
speak
to
Miss
Dartle
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
have
Miss
Dartle
send
you
for
me
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
   
<EOS>
"
not
tonight
,
sir
,
but
it
be
just
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Dartle
see
you
pass
a
night
or
two
ago
;
and
I
be
to
sit
at
work
on
the
staircase
,
and
when
I
see
you
pass
again
,
to
ask
you
to
step
in
and
speak
to
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
turn
back
,
and
inquire
of
my
conductor
,
as
we
go
along
,
how
Mrs
Steerforth
be
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
her
lady
be
but
poorly
,
and
keep
her
own
room
a
good
deal
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
arrive
at
the
house
,
I
be
direct
to
Miss
Dartle
in
the
garden
,
and
leave
to
make
my
presence
know
to
her
myself
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
sit
on
a
seat
at
one
end
of
a
kind
of
terrace
,
overlook
the
great
city
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
sombre
evening
,
with
a
lurid
light
in
the
sky
;
and
as
I
see
the
prospect
scowling
in
the
distance
,
with
here
and
there
some
large
object
start
up
into
the
sullen
glare
,
I
fancy
it
be
no
inapt
companion
to
the
memory
of
this
fierce
woman
.
   
<EOS>
She
see
me
as
I
advance
,
and
rise
for
a
moment
to
receive
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
her
,
then
,
still
more
colourless
and
thin
than
when
I
have
see
her
last
;
the
flashing
eye
still
brighter
,
and
the
scar
still
plainer
.
   
<EOS>
Our
meeting
be
not
cordial
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
part
angrily
on
the
last
occasion
;
and
there
be
an
air
of
disdain
about
her
,
which
she
take
no
pain
to
conceal
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
tell
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
,
Miss
Dartle
,
"
say
I
,
stand
near
her
,
with
my
hand
upon
the
back
of
the
seat
,
and
decline
her
gesture
of
invitation
to
sit
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
you
please
,
"
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
have
this
girl
be
find
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
yet
she
have
run
away
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
see
her
thin
lip
work
while
she
look
at
me
,
as
if
they
be
eager
to
load
her
with
reproach
.
   
<EOS>
"
run
away
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
from
him
,
"
she
say
,
with
a
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
she
be
not
find
,
perhaps
she
never
will
be
find
.
 
<EOS>
She
may
be
dead
!
"
   
<EOS>
the
vaunting
cruelty
with
which
she
meet
my
glance
<EOS>
,
I
never
see
express
in
any
other
face
that
ever
I

clear
his

reproach

set
off
one
morning

from

we
have
a
villa

the
young

be
very
partial
to
the

,
under
pretence
of
come
back
in

day

so

leave
it
in

break
it
out

go
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mr
James
,
I
must
say
,
certainly
do
behave
extremely
honourable
;
for
he
propose
that
the
young
woman
should
marry
a
very
respectable
person
,
who
be
fully
prepared
to
overlook
the
past
,
and
who
be
,
at
least
,
as
good
as
anybody
the
young
woman
could
have
aspire
to
in
a
regular
way
:
<EOS>
her
connexion
be
very
common
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
change
leg
again
,
and
wet
his
lip
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
convince
that
the
scoundrel
speak
of
himself
,

I
see
my
conviction
reflect
in
Miss
Dartle
's
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
this
I
also
have
it
in
charge
to
communicate
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
willing
to
do
anything
to
relieve
Mr
James
from
his
difficulty
,

to
restore
harmony
between
himself
and
an
affectionate
parent
,
who
have
undergo
so
much
on
his
account

<EOS>
therefore
I
undertake
the
commission

<EOS>
the
young

's
violence

she
come
to

I
break
the
fact

beyond
all
expectation

She
be
quite
mad

have
to
be

by
force

,
if
she
could
not
have
get
to
a
knife

get
to
the

she
would
have
beat
her
head
against

marble
floor

Miss
Dartle

lean
back
upon

light
of
exultation

rub
his

uneasily

anybody
may

well
of

indignantly

much
as
to

resume
his
narrative

It
be
necessary

in

to
take
away
everything
nigh

do
herself

,
"
that
I
understand
this
fellow
's
part
in
the
wicked
story
,
and
that
,
as
I
shall
make
it
known
to
the
honest
man
who
have
be
her
father
from
her
childhood
,
I
would
recommend
him
to
avoid
go
too
much
into
public
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
have
stop
the
moment
I
begin
,
and
have
listen
with
his
usual
repose
of
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
will
excuse
me
if
I
say
,
sir
,
that
there
be
neither
slave
nor
slave
-
driver
in
this
country
,
and
that
people
be
not
allow
to
take
the
law
into
their
own
hand
.
 
<EOS>
if
they
do
,
it
be
more
to
their
own
peril
,
I
believe
,
than
to
other
people
's
.
 
<EOS>
consequently
speak
,
I
be
not
at
all
afraid
of
go
wherever
I
may
wish
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
with
that
,
he
make
a
polite
bow
;
and
,
with
another
to
Miss
Dartle
,
go
away
through
the
arch
in
the
wall
of
holly
by
which
he
have
come
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Dartle
<EOS>
and
I
regard
each
other
for
a
little
while
in
silence
;
her
manner
be
exactly
what
it
be
,
when
she
have
produce
the
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
say
besides
,
"
she
observe
,
with
a
slow
curling
of
her
lip
,
"
that
his
master
,
as
he
hear
,
be
coast
Spain
;
and
this
done
,
be
away
to
gratify
his
seafare
taste
till
he
be
weary
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
of
no
interest
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
between
these
two
proud
person
,
mother
and
son
,
there
be
a
wide
breach
than
before
,
and
little
hope
of
its
healing
,
for
they
be
one
at
heart
,
and
time
make
each
more
obstinate
and
imperious
.
 
<EOS>
neither
be
this
of
any
interest
to
you
;
but
it
introduce
what
I
wish
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
this
devil
whom
you
make
an
angel
of
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
this
low
girl
whom
he
pick
out
of
the
tide
-
mud
,
"
with
her
black
eye
full
upon
me
,
and
her
passionate
finger
up
,
"
may
be
alive
,
---
<EOS>
for
I
believe
some
common
thing
be
hard
to
die
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
be
,
you
will
desire
to
have
a
pearl
of
such
price
find
and
take
care
of
.
 
<EOS>
We
desire
that
,
too
;
that
he
may
not
by
any
chance
be
make
her
prey
again
.
 
<EOS>
so
far
,
we
be
unite
in
one
interest
;
and
that
be
why
I
,
who
would
do
her
any
mischief
that
so
coarse
<EOS>
a
wretch
be
capable
of
feeling
,
have
send
for
you
to
hear
what
you
have
hear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
see
,
by
the
change
in
her
face
,
that
someone
be
advance
behind
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Mrs
Steerforth
,
who
give
me
her
hand
more
coldly
than
of
yore
,
and
with
an
augmentation
of
her
former
stateliness
of
manner
,
but
still
,
I
perceive
---
<EOS>
and
I
be
touch
by
it
---
with
an
ineffaceable
remembrance
of
my
old
love
for
her
son
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
greatly
alter
.
 
<EOS>
Her
fine
figure
be
far
less
upright
,
her
handsome
face
be
deeply
marked
,
and
her
hair
be
almost
white
.
<EOS>
but
when
she
sit
down
on
the
seat
,
she
be
a
handsome
lady
still
;
and
well
I
know
the
bright
eye
with
its
lofty
look
,
that
have
be
a
light
in
my
very
dream
at
school
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield

of
everything
,
Rosa

"
   
<EOS>
"
yes

and
have
he

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes

I
have
tell
him
why
you

it

"
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
good
girl
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
have
some
slight
correspondence
with
your
former
friend
,
sir

"
address
me
,
"
but
it
have
not
restore
his
sense
of
duty
or
natural
obligation
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
I
have
no
other
object
in
this
,
than
what
Rosa
have
mention
.
 
<EOS>
if
,
by
the
course
which
may
relieve
the
mind
of
the
decent
man
you
bring
here
(
for
whom
I
be
sorry

I
can
say
no
more
)
,
my
son
may
be
save
from
again
fall
into
the
snare
of
a
design
enemy

well

"
   
<EOS>
She
draw
herself
up
,
and
sit
look
straight
before
her
,
far
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
<EOS>
I
say
respectfully
,
"
I
understand
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
I
be
in
no
danger
of
put
any
strained
construction
on
your
motive
.
<EOS>
but
I
must
say
,
even
to
you
,
have
know
this
injure
family
from
childhood
,
that
if
you
suppose
the
girl
,
so
deeply
wronged
,
have
not
be
cruelly
delude
,
and
would
not
rather
die
a
hundred
death
than
take
a
cup
of
water
from
your
son
's
hand
now
,
you
cherish
a
terrible
mistake
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
Rosa
,
well
!
"
say
Mrs
Steerforth
,
<EOS>
as
the
other
be
about
to
interpose
,
"
it
be
no
matter
.
 
<EOS>
let
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
married
,
sir
,
I
be
tell
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
answer
that
I
have
be
some
time
married
.
   
<EOS>
"
and
be
do
well
?
 
<EOS>
I
hear
little
in
the
quiet
life
I
lead
,
but
I
understand
you
be
begin
to
be
famous
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
very
fortunate
,
"
I
say
,
"
and
find
my
name
connect
with
some
praise
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
mother
?
"
<EOS>
---
in
a
softened
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
no
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
pity
,
"
she
return
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
would
have
be
proud
of
you
.
<EOS>
good
night
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
take
the
hand
she
hold
out
with
a
dignified
,
unbend
air
,
and
it
be
as
calm
in
mine
as
if
her
breast
have
be
at
peace
.
 
<EOS>
Her
pride
could
still
its
very
pulse
,
it
appear
,
and
draw
the
placid
veil
before
her
face
,
through
which
she
sit
look
straight
before
her
on
the
far
distance
.
   
<EOS>
as
I
move
away
from
them
along
the
terrace
,
I
could
not
help
observe
how
steadily
they
both
sit
gaze
on
the
prospect
,
and
how
it
thicken
and
close
around
them
.
 
<EOS>
here
and
there
,
some
early
lamp
be
see
to
twinkle
in
the
distant
city
;
and
in
the
eastern
quarter
of
the
sky
the
lurid
light
still
hover
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
from
the
great
part
of
the
broad
valley
interpose
,
a
mist
be
rise
like
a
sea
,
which
,
mingle
with
the
darkness
,
make
it
seem
as
if
the
gathering
water
would
encompass
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
reason
to
remember
this
,
and
think
of
it
with
awe
;
for
before
I
look
upon
those
two
again
,
a
stormy
sea
have
rise
to
their
foot
.
   
<EOS>
reflect
on
what
have
be
thus
tell
me
,
I
feel
it
right
that
it
should
be
communicate
to
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
follow
evening
I
go
into
London
in
quest
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
always
wander
about
from
place
to
place
,
with
his
one
object
of
recover
his
niece
before
him
;
but
be
more
in
London
than
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
often
and
often
,
now
,
have
I
see
him
in
the
dead
of
night
pass
along
the
street
,
search
,
among
the
few
who
loiter
out
of
door
at
those
untimely
hour
,
for
what
he
dread
to
find
.
   
<EOS>
He
keep
a
lodging
over
the
little
chandler
's
shop
in
Hungerford
Market
,
which
I
have
have
occasion
to
mention
more
than
once
,
and
from
which
he
first
go
forth
upon
his
errand
of
mercy
.
 
<EOS>
Hither
I
direct
my
walk
.
 
<EOS>
on
make
inquiry
for
him
,
I
learn
from
the
people
of
the
house
that
he
have
not
go
out
yet
,
and
I
should
find
him
in
his
room
upstairs
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
sit
read
by
a
window
in
which
he
keep
a
few
plant
.
<EOS>
the
room
be
very
neat
and
orderly
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
in
a
moment
that
it
be
always
keep
prepared
for
her
reception
,
and
that
he
never
go
out
<EOS>
but
he
think
it
possible
he
may
bring
her
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
hear
my
tap
at
the
door
,
and
only
raise
his
eye
when
I
lay
my
hand
upon
his
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mas'r
Davy
!
<EOS>
Thankee
,
sir
!
<EOS>
thankee
hearty
,
for
this
visit
!
<EOS>
sit
ye
down
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
kindly
welcome
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
say
I
,
take
the
chair
he
hand
me
,
"
do
not
expect
much
!
<EOS>
I
have
hear
some
news
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
of
Em'ly
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
put
his
hand
,
in
a
nervous
manner
,
on
his
mouth
,
and
turn
pale
,
as
he
fix
his
eye
on
mine
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
give
no
clue
to
where
she
be
;
but
she
be
not
with
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
sit
down
,
look
intently
at
me
,
and
listen
in
profound
silence
to
all
I
have
to
tell
.
 
<EOS>
I
well
remember
the
sense
of
dignity
,
beauty
even
,
with
which
the
patient
gravity
of
his
face
impress
me
,
when
,
have
gradually
remove
his
eye
from
mine
,
he
sit
look
downward
,
lean
his
forehead
on
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
offer
no
interruption
,
but
remain
throughout
perfectly
still
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
to
pursue
her
figure
through
the
narrative
,
and
to
let
every
other
shape
go
by
him
,
as
if
it
be
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
have
do
,
he
shade
his
face
,
and
continue
silent
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
out
of
the
window
for
a
little
while
,
and
occupy
myself
with
the
plant
.
   
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
fare
to
feel
about
it
,
Mas'r
Davy
?
<EOS>
"
he
inquire
at
length
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
she
be
live
,
"
I
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
doen't
know
.
 
<EOS>
maybe
the
first
shock
be
too
rough
,
and
in
the
wildness
of
her
art
---
!
<EOS>
that
there
blue
water
as
she
use
to
speak
on
.
 
<EOS>
Could
she
have
thowt
o
'
<EOS>
that
so
many
year
,
because
it
be
to
be
her
grave
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
say
this
,
muse
,
in
a
low
,
frightened
voice
;
and
walk
across
the
little
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
yet
,
"
he
add
,
"
Mas'r
Davy
,
I
have
feel
so
sure
as
she
be
live
<EOS>

I
have
know'd

and
sleep
,
as
it
be
so
trew
that
I
should
find
her

I
have
be
so
lead
on
by
it

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
Em'ly

<EOS>
He
put
his
hand
down
firmly
on
the
table
,
and
set
his
sunburnt
face
into
a
resolute
expression
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
niece
,
Em'ly
,

alive

steadfastly

<EOS>
He
look
almost
like
a
man
inspire
,
as
he
say
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
wait
for
a
few
moment
,
until
he
could
give
me
his
undivided
attention
;
and
then
proceed
to
explain
the
precaution
,
that
,
it
have
occur
to
me
last
night

it
would
be
wise
to
take

both
of

she
should
make
her
way
to
London

be
likely

for
where
could
she
lose
herself
so
readily
as
in
this
vast
city

what
would
she
wish
to
do
,

lose
and
hide
herself
,

do
not

home

and
she
will
not

interpose
,
shake
his
head
mournfully

more
likely

discover
her

do
you
remember

hear
what
I
say

with
fortitude

sink
our
voice
,
almost
to
a
whisper
,
and
continue
to
speak
in
that
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
say
you
have
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
think
that
you
could
find
her
?
<EOS>
I
could
only
hope
to
do
so
by
chance
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
I
know
wheer
to
look

<EOS>

It
be
dark
.
 
<EOS>
be
together

shall
we
go
out
now
,
and
try
to
find
her
tonight
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
assent
,
and
prepare
to
accompany
me
.
 
<EOS>
without
appear
to
observe
what
he
be
do
,
I
see
how
carefully
he
adjust
the
little
room
,
put
a
candle
ready
and
<EOS>
the
mean
of
light
it
,
arrange
the
bed
,
and
finally
take
out
of
a
drawer
one
of
her
dress
(
I
remember
to
have
see
her
wear
it
)
,
neatly
fold
with
some
other
garment
,
and
a
bonnet
,
which
he
place
upon
a
chair
.
<EOS>
He
make
no
allusion
to
these
clothe
,
neither
do
<EOS>
I.
 
<EOS>
there
they
have
be
wait
for
her
,
many
and
many
a
night
,
no
doubt
.

"
<EOS>
the

Mas'r
Davy

he
say
,
as
we
come
downstairs
,
"
when
I
thowt
this
girl
,
Martha
,
a'most
like
the
dirt
underneath
my
em'ly
's
foot

<EOS>
God
forgive
me
,
theer
be
a

now

"
   
<EOS>
as
we
go
along
,
partly
to
hold
him
in
conversation
,
and
partly
to
satisfy
myself
,
I
ask
him
about
Ham
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
almost
in
the
same
word
as
formerly
,
that
Ham
be
just
the
same
,
"
wear
away
his
life
with
kiender
no
care
nohow
for
'
t
;
but
never
murmur
,
and
like
by
all
"
.
   
<EOS>
I
ask
him
what
he
think
Ham
's
state
of
mind
be
,
in
reference
to
the
cause
of
their
misfortune
?
 
<EOS>
whether
he
believe
it
be
dangerous
?
 
<EOS>
what
he
suppose
,
for
example
,
Ham
would
do
,
if
he
and
Steerforth
ever
should
encounter
?
   
<EOS>
"
I
doen't
know
,
sir
,
"
he
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
thowt
of
it
oftentime
,
but
I
can
not
awize
myself
of
it
,
no
matter

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
recall
to
his
remembrance
the
morning
after
her
departure
,
when
we
be
all
three
on
the
beach
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
recollect
,
"
say
I
,
"
a
certain
wild
way
in
which
he
look
out
to
sea
,
and
speak
about
"
the
end
of
it

?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
sure
I
do
!
"
say
he
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
suppose
he
mean
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
he
reply
,
"
I
have
put
the
question
to
myself
a
mort
<EOS>
o
'
time
,
and
never
find
no
answer
.
 
<EOS>
and
theer
's
one
curious
thing
---
<EOS>
that
,
though
he
be
so
pleasant
,
I
would
not
fare
to
feel
comfortable
to
try
and
get
his
mind
upon

<EOS>
He
never
say
a
wure
to
me
as
warn't
<EOS>
as
dootiful
as
dootiful
could
be
,
and
it
be
not
likely
as
he
would
begin
to
speak
any
other
way
now
;
but
it
be
fur
from
be
fleet
water
in
his
mind

where
them
thowt
lay

<EOS>
It
be
deep
,
sir

I
can
not
see
down

<EOS>
"
You
be
right

say
I

sometimes
make

anxious

me
too

he
rejoin

even
more
so
,
I
do
assure
you
,
than
his
ventersome
way

though
both
belong
to
the
alteration
in
him

<EOS>
I
<EOS>
doen't
know
as
he
would
do
violence
under
any
circumstance

but
I
hope
as
them
two
may
be
kep
asunder

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
We
have
come
,
through
Temple
Bar
,
into
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
converse
no
more
now
,
and
walk
at
my
side
,
he
yield
himself
up
to
the
one
aim
of
his
devoted
life
,
and
go
on
,
with
that
hush
concentration
of
his
faculty
which
would
have
make
his
figure
solitary
in
a
multitude
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
not
far
from
Blackfriars
Bridge
,
when
he
turn
his
head
and
point
to
a
solitary
female
figure
flit
along
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
,
readily
,
to
be
the
figure
that
we
seek
.
   
<EOS>
We
cross
the
road
,
and
be
press
on
towards
her
,
when
it
occur
to
me
that
she
may
be
more
disposed
to
feel
a
woman
's
interest
in
the
lost
girl
,
if
we
speak
to
her
in
a
quieter
place
,
aloof
from
the
crowd
,
and
where
we
should
be
less
observed
.
 
<EOS>
I
advise
my
companion
,
therefore
,
that
we
should
not
address
her
yet
,
but
follow
her
;
consult
in
this
,
likewise
,
an
indistinct
desire
I
have
,
to
know
where
she
go
.
   
<EOS>
He
acquiesce
,
we
follow
at
a
distance
:
never
lose
sight
of
her
,
but
never
care
to
come
very
near
,
as
she
frequently
look
about
.
 
<EOS>
once
,
she
stop
to
listen
to
a
band
of
music
;
and
then
we
stop
too
.
   
<EOS>
She
go
on
a
long
way
.
 
<EOS>
still
we
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
evident
,
from
the
manner
in
which
she
hold
her
course
,
that
she
be
go
to
some
fix
destination
;
and
this
,
and
her
keeping
in
the
busy
street
,
and
I
suppose
the
strange
fascination
in
the
secrecy
and
mystery
of
so
follow
anyone
,
make
me
adhere
to
my
first
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
she
turn
into
a
dull
,
dark
street
,
where
the
noise
and
crowd
be
lose
;
and
I
say
,
"
We
may
speak
to
her
now
"
;
<EOS>
and
,
mend
our
pace
,
we
go
after
her

<EOS>
Martha
 
<EOS>
We
be
now
down
in
Westminster
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
turn
back
to
follow
her
,
have
encounter
her
come
towards
us
;
and
Westminster
Abbey
be
the
point
at
which
she
pass
from
the
light
and
noise
of
the
lead
street
.
 
<EOS>
She
proceed
so
quickly
,
when
she
get
free
of
the
two
current
of
passenger
set
towards
and
from
the
bridge
,
that
,
between
this
and
the
advance
she
have
of
us
when
she
strike
off
,
we
be
in
the
narrow
water
-
side
street
by
Millbank
before
we
come
up
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
moment
she
cross
the
road
,
as
if
to
avoid
the
footstep
that
she
hear
so
close
behind
;
and
,
without
look
back
,
pass
on
even
more
rapidly
.
   
<EOS>
a
glimpse
of
the
river
through
a
dull
gateway
,
where
some
waggon
be
house
for
the
night
,
seem
to
arrest
my
foot
.
 
<EOS>
I
touch
my
companion
without
speak
,
and
we
both
forbore
to
cross
after
her
,
and
both
follow
on
that
opposite
side
of
the
way
;
keep
as
quietly
as
we
could
in
the
shadow
of
the
house
,
but
keep
very
near
her
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
,
and
be
when
I
write
,
at
the
end
of
that
low
-
lie
street
,
<EOS>
a
dilapidated
little
wooden
building
,
probably
an
obsolete
old
ferry
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
Its
position
be
just
at
that
point
where
the
street
cease
,
and
the
road
begin
to
lie
between
a
row
of
house
and
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
come
here
,
and
see
the
water
,
she
stop
as
if
she
have
come
to
her
destination
;
and
presently
go
slowly
along
by
the
brink
of
the
river
,
look
intently
at
it
.
   
<EOS>
all
the
way
here
,
I
have
suppose
that
she
be
go
to
some
house
;
indeed
,
I
have
vaguely
entertain
the
hope
that
the
house
may
be
in
some
way
associate
with
the
lost
girl
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
one
dark
glimpse
of
the
river
,
through
the
gateway
,
have
instinctively
prepare
me
for
her
go
no
farther
.
   
<EOS>
the
neighbourhood
be
a
dreary
one
at
that
time
;
as
oppressive
,
sad
,
and
solitary
by
night
,
as
any
about
London
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
neither
wharf
nor
house
on
the
melancholy
waste
of
road
near
the
great
blank
prison
.
 
<EOS>
a
sluggish
ditch
deposit
its
mud
at
the
prison
wall
.
 
<EOS>
coarse
grass
and
rank
weed
straggle
over
all
the
marshy
land
in
the
vicinity
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
part
,
carcase
of
house
,
inauspiciously
begin
and
never
finish
,
rot
away
.
 
<EOS>
in
another
,
the
ground
be
cumber
with
rusty
iron
monster
of
steam
-
boiler
,
wheel
,
crank
,
pipe
,
furnace
,
paddle
,
anchor
,
diving
-
bell
,
windmill
-
sail
,
and
I
know
not
<EOS>
what
strange
object
,
accumulate
by
some
speculator
,
and
grovel
in
the
dust
,
underneath
which
---
have
sink
into
the
soil
of
their
own
weight
in
wet
weather
<EOS>
---
they
have
the
appearance
of
vainly
try
to
hide
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
the
clash
and
glare
of
sundry
fiery
work
upon
the
river
-
side
,
arise
by
night
to
disturb
everything
except
the
heavy
and
unbroken
smoke
that
pour
out
of
their
chimney
.
 
<EOS>
slimy
gap
and
causeway
,
wind
among
old
wooden
pile
,
with
a
sickly
substance
cling
to
the

like
green

man
flutter
above
high

water
mark
,
lead
down
through
the
ooze
and
slush
to
the

<EOS>
there
be
a
story
that
one
of
the
pit
dig
for
the
dead
in
the
time
of
the
Great
Plague
be
hereabout
;
and
a
blighting
influence
seem
to
have
proceed
from
it
over
the
whole
place
.
 
<EOS>
or
else
it
look
as
if
it
have
gradually
decompose
into
that
nightmare
condition
,
out
of
the
overflowing
of
the
polluted
stream
.
   
<EOS>
as
if
she
be
a
part
of
the
refuse
it
have
cast
out
,
and
leave
to
corruption
and
decay
,
the
girl
we
have
follow
stray
down
to
the
river
's
brink
,
and
stand
in
the
midst
of
this
night
-
picture
,
lonely
and
still
,
look
at
the
water
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
some
boat
and
barge
<EOS>
astrand
in
the
mud
,
and
these
enable
us
to
come
within
a
few
yard
of
her
without
be
see
.
<EOS>
I
then
sign
to
Mr
Peggotty
to
remain
where
he
be
,
and
emerge
from
their
shade
to
speak
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
approach
her
solitary
figure
without
tremble
;
for
this
gloomy
end
to
her
determined
walk
,
and
the
way
in
which
she
stand
,
almost
within
the
cavernous
shadow
of
the
iron
bridge
,
look
at
the
light
crookedly
reflect
in
the
strong
tide
,
inspire
a
dread
within
me
.
   
<EOS>
I
think
she
be
talk
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
,
<EOS>
although
absorb
in
gaze
at
the
water
,
that
her
shawl
be
off
her
shoulder
,
and
that
she
be
muffle
her
hand
in
it
,
in
an
unsettled
and
bewilder
way
,
more
like
the
action
of
a
sleep
-
walker
than
a
wake
person
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
,
and
never
can
forget
,
that
there
be
that
in
her
wild
manner
which
give
me
no
assurance
but
that
she
would
sink
before
my
eye
,
until
I
have
her
arm
within
my
grasp
.
   
<EOS>
at
the
same
moment
I
say
"
Martha
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
utter
a
terrified
scream
,
and
struggle
with
me
with
such
strength
that
I
doubt
if
I
could
have
hold
her
alone
.
 
<EOS>
but
a
strong
hand
than
mine
be
lay
upon
her
;
and
when
she
raise
her
frightened
eye
and
see
whose
it
be
,
she
make
but
one
more
effort
and
drop
down
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
We
carry
her
away
from
the
water
to
where
there
be
some
dry
stone
,
and
there
lay
her
down
,
cry
and
moaning
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
little
while
she
sit
among
the
stone
,
hold
her
wretched
head
with
both
her
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
the
river

<EOS>
"
she
cry
passionately
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh

the
river

"
   
<EOS>
"
hush
,
hush
!
"
say
I.
 
"
calm
yourself

"
   
<EOS>
but
she
still
repeat
the
same
word
,
continually
exclaim
,
"
oh
,
the
river
!
"
<EOS>
over
and
over
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
I

come
from

there
be

it
creep
through
the
dismal

go
away

like
my

to
a
great
sea

be
always
troubled

I
feel
that
I
must
go
with
it

I

never

be

in
the
tone

the
dreadful
river

<EOS>
the
thought
pass
through
my
mind
that
in
the
face
of
my
companion
,
as
he
look
upon
her
without
speech
or
motion
,
I
may
have
read
his
niece

history
,
if
I
have
know
nothing

<EOS>
I
never
see

in

horror
and
compassion
so
impressively
blend

He
shake
as
if
he
would
have
fall
;
and
his
hand
<EOS>
---
I
touch
it
with
my
own
,
for
his
appearance

alarm
me

be
deadly
cold

"
She

I
whisper
to

<EOS>
He
make
some
motion
with
his
mouth
,
and
seem
to
think
he
have
speak
;
but
he
have
only
point
to
her
with
his
outstretched
hand
.
   
<EOS>
a
new
burst
of
crying
come
upon
her
now
,
in
which
she
once
more
hide
her
face
among
the
stone
,
and
lie
before
us
,
a
prostrate
image
of
humiliation
and
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
know
that
this
state
must
pass
,
before
we
could
speak
to
her
with
any
hope
,
I
venture
to
restrain
him
when
he
would
have
raise
her
,
and
we
stand
by
in
silence
until
she
become
more
tranquil
.
   
<EOS>
"
Martha
,
"
say
I
then
,
lean
down
,
and
help
her
to
rise
---
she
seem
to
want
to
rise
as
if
with
the
intention
of
go
away
,
but
she
be
weak
,
and
lean
against
a
boat
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
who
this
be
,
who
be
with
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
say
faintly
,
"
yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
that
we
have
follow
you
a
long
way
tonight
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
shake
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
She
look
neither
at
him
nor
at
me
,
but
stand
in
a
humble
attitude
,
hold
her
bonnet
and
shawl
in
one
hand
,
without
appear
conscious
of
them
,
and
press
the
other
,
clench
,
against
her
forehead
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
you
compose
enough
,
"
say
I
,
"
to
speak
on
the
subject
which
so
interested
you
<EOS>
---
I
hope
Heaven
may
remember
it
!
---
that
snowy
night
?
"
   
<EOS>
Her
sobs
break
out
afresh
,
and
she
murmur
some
inarticulate
thank
to
me
for
not
have
drive
her
away
from
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
say
nothing
for
myself

she

,
after
a
few
moment
.
<EOS>
"
I

bad
,
I

no

but
tell
him
,

shrink
away
from

"
if

hard

"
It

I
return

earnestly
respond
to
her
earnestness

<EOS>
"
It

I
do
not

she

,
in
a
broken
voice

the
night

such

so
gentle

I.

should
have
be
in
the
river
long
ago

she
say
,
glance
at
it
with
a
terrible
expression
,
"
if
any
wrong
to
her

be
upon
my
mind

<EOS>
I
never
could
have
keep
out
of
it
a

winter
's
night

the

with
most
forlorn
regret

<EOS>
She
never

a

what

pleasant

right

it
likely

well

Mr

stand
with
one
hand
on
the
gunwale
of

down

and
when

hear
what
have
happen
before

snowy
night

cry
Martha

the
bitter

that

remember

company

would

corrupt

long
unused

agony

to
be
old

in

wretched
street

about

avoid

in
the
dark

to
see
the
day
break
on
the
ghastly
line
of
house

remember
how
the

sun
use
to
shine
into

once

<EOS>
sink
on
the
stone
,
she
take
some
in
each
hand
,
and
clench
them
up
,
as
if
she
would
have
grind
them

<EOS>
She
writhe
into
some
new
posture
constantly
:
stiffen
her
arm
,
twist
them
before
her
face

as
though
to
shut
out
from
her
eye
the
little
light
there
be
,

droop
her
head

as

it
be
heavy
with
insupportable
recollection

what
shall
I
ever

despair

He
look
upon
her
,
while
she
make
this
supplication
,
in
a
wild
distracted
manner
;

,
when
she
be
silent

gently
raise
her

His

She
stand

shrinkingly

before

her
passionate

maybe
you
can

you

up

I
read

in

plain
impressive
way

deliver
himself

one
day

solitary
course

Mas'r

that

<EOS>
help
us
all
you
can
to
find
her
,
and
may
Heaven
reward
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
look
at
him
hastily
,
and
for
the
first
time
,
as
if
she
be
doubtful
of
what
he
have
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
trust
me
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
,
in
a
low
voice
of
astonishment
.
   
<EOS>
"
full
and
free
!
"
say
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
to
speak
to
her
,
if
I
should
ever
find
her
;
shelter
her
,
if
I
have
any
shelter
to
divide
with
her
;
and
then
,
without
her
knowledge
,
come
to
you
,
and
bring
you
to
her
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
hurriedly
.
   
<EOS>
We
both
reply
together
,
"
yes
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
lift
up
her
eye
,
and
solemnly
declare
that
she
would
devote
herself
to
this
task
,
fervently
and
faithfully
.
 
<EOS>
that
she
would
never
waver
in
it
,
never
be
divert
from
it
,
never
relinquish
it
,
while
there
be
any
chance
of
hope
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
be
not
true
to
it
,
may
the
object
she
now
have
in
life
,
which
bind
her
to
something
devoid
of
evil
,
in
its
pass
away
from
her
,
leave
her
more
forlorn
and
more
despairing
,
if
that
be
possible
,
than
she
have
be
upon
the
river
's
brink
that
night
;
and
then
may
all
help
,
human
and
Divine
,
renounce
her
evermore
!
   
<EOS>
She
do
not
raise
her
voice
above
her
breath
,
or
address
us
,
but
say
this
to
the
night
sky
;
then
stand
profoundly
quiet
,
look
at
the
gloomy
water
.
   
<EOS>
We
judge
it
expedient
,
now
,
to
tell
her
all
we
know
;
which
I
recount
at
length
.
 
<EOS>
She
listen
with
great
attention
,
and
with
a
face
that
often
change
,
but
have
the
same
purpose
in
all
its
varying
expression
.
 
<EOS>
Her
eye
occasionally
fill
with
tear
,
but
those
she
repress
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
her
spirit
be
quite
alter
,
and
she
could
not
be
too
quiet
.
   
<EOS>
She
ask
,
when
all
be
tell
,
where
we
be
to
be
communicate
with
,
if
occasion
should
arise
.
 
<EOS>
under
a
dull
lamp
in
the
road
,
I
write
our
two
address
on
a
leaf
of
my
pocket
-
book
,
which
I
tear
out
and
give
to
her
,
and
which
she
put
in
her
poor
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
her
where
she
live
herself
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
,
after
a
pause
,
in
no
place
long
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
well
not
to
know
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
suggest
to
me
,
in
a
whisper
<EOS>
,
what
have
already
occur
to
myself
,
I
take
out
my
purse
;
but
I
could
not
prevail
upon
her
to
accept
any
money
,
nor
could
I
exact
any
promise
from
her
that
she
would
do
so
at
another
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
represent
to
her
that
Mr
Peggotty
could
not
be
call
,
for
one
in
his
condition
,
poor
;
and
that
the
idea
of
her
engage
in
this
search
,
while
depend
on
her
own
resource
,
shock
us
both
.
 
<EOS>
She
continue
steadfast
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
particular
,
his
influence
upon
her
be
equally
powerless
with
mine
.
 
<EOS>
She
gratefully
thank
him
but
remain
inexorable
.
   
<EOS>
"
there
may
be
work
to
be
get
,
"
she
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
at
least
take
some
assistance
,
"
I
return
,
"
until
you
have
try
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
do
what
I
have
promise
,
for
money
,
"
she
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
take
it
,
if
I
be
starve
.
 
<EOS>
to
give
me
money
would
be
to
take
away
your

take
away
the
object
that
you
have
give
me
,
to
take
away
the
only
certain
thing
that
save
me
from
the
river

"
   
<EOS>
"
in
the
name
of
the
great
judge

say
I
,
"
before
whom
you
and
all
of
us
must
stand
at
His
dread
time

dismiss
that
terrible
idea

We
can
all
do
some
good
,
if
we
will

<EOS>
She
tremble
,
and
her
lip
shake
,
and
her
face
be
paler
,
as
she
answer
:
   
"
It
have
be
put
into
your
heart
,
perhaps
,
to
save
a
wretched
creature
for
repentance
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
to
think
so
;
it
seem
too
bold
.
 
<EOS>
if
any
good
should
come
of
me
,
I
may
begin
to
hope
;
for
nothing
but
harm
have
ever
come
of
my
deed
yet

<EOS>
I
be
to
be
trust

for
the
first
time
in
a
long
while
,
with
my
miserable
life
,
on
account
of
what
you
have
give
me
to
try
for
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
no
more
,
and
I
can
say
no
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
again
she
repress
the
tear
that
have
begin
to
flow
;
and
,
put
out
her
tremble
hand
,
and
touch
Mr
Peggotty
,
as
if
there
be
some
healing
virtue
in
him
,
go
away
along
the
desolate
road
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
ill
,
probably
for
a
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
observe
,
upon
that
close
opportunity
of
observation
,
that
she
be
wear
and
haggard
,
and
that
her
sink
eye
express
privation
and
endurance
.
   
<EOS>
We
follow
her
at
a
short
distance
,
our
way
lie
in
the
same
direction
,
until
we
come
back
into
the
lighted
and
populous
street
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
such
implicit
confidence
in
her
declaration
,
that
I
then
put
it
to
Mr
Peggotty
,
whether
it
would
not
seem
,
in
the
onset
,
like
distrust
her
,
to
follow
her
any
farther
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
of
the
same
mind
,
and
equally
reliant
on
her
,
we
suffer
her
to
take
her
own
road
,
and
take
ours
,
which
be
towards
Highgate
.
 
<EOS>
He
accompany
me
a
good
part
of
the
way
;
and
when
we
part
,
with
a
prayer
for
the
success
of
this
fresh
effort
,
there
be
a
new
and
thoughtful
compassion
in
him
that
I
be
at
no
loss
to
interpret
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
midnight
when
I
arrive
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
reach
my
own
gate
,
and
be
stand
listen
for
the
deep
bell
of
St
Paul
's
,
the
sound
of
which
I
think
have
be
bear
towards
me
among
the
multitude
of
strike
clock
,
when
I
be
rather
surprised
to
see
that
the
door
of
my
aunt
's
cottage
be
open
,
and
that
a
faint
light
in
the
entry
be
shine
out
across
the
road
.
   
<EOS>
think
that
my
aunt
may
have
relapse
into
one
of
her
old
alarm
,
and
may
be
watch
the
progress
of
some
imaginary
conflagration
in
the
distance
,
I
go
to
speak
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
with
very
great
surprise
that
I
see
a
man
stand
in
her
little
garden
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
a
glass
and
bottle
in
his
hand
,
and
be
in
the
act
of
drinking
.
 
<EOS>
I
stop
short
,
among
the
thick
foliage
outside
,
for
the
moon
<EOS>
be
up
now
,
though
obscure
;
and
I
recognize
the
man
whom
I
have
once
suppose
to
be
a
delusion
of
Mr
Dick
's
,
and
have
once
encounter
with
my
aunt
in
the
street
of
the
city
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
eat
as
well
as
drinking
,
and
seem
to
eat
with
a
hungry
appetite
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
curious
regard
the
cottage
,
too
,
as
if
it
be
the
first
time
he
have
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
after
stoop
to
put
the
bottle
on
the
ground
,
he
look
up
at
the
window
,
and
look
about
;
though
with
a
covert
and
impatient
air
,
as
if
he
be
anxious
to
be
go
.
   
<EOS>
the
light
in
the
passage
be
obscure
for
a
moment
,
and
my
aunt
come
out
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
agitate
,
and
tell
some
money
into
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I

return
my

with
great
emotion
;

how
can

so

<EOS>
but
why

It

at
length

in

of
himself

he
appear
abash
by
my

indignant
tear

come
slouch
out

repay

domestic
 
<EOS>
I
labour
hard
at
my
book
,
without
allow
it
to
interfere
with
the
punctual
discharge
of
my
newspaper
duty
;
and
it
come
out
and
be
very
successful
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
stun
by
the
praise
which
sound
in
my
ear
,
notwithstanding
that
I
be
keenly
alive
to
it
,
and
think
well
of
my
own
performance
,
I
have
little
doubt
,
than
anybody
else
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
always
be
in
my
observation
of
human
nature
,
that
a
man
who
have
any
good
reason
to
believe
in
himself
never
flourish
himself
before
the
face
of
other
people
in
order
that
they
may
believe
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
reason
,
I
retain
my
modesty
in
very
self
-
respect
;
and
the
more
praise
I
get
,
the
more
I
try
to
deserve
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
my
purpose
,
in
this
record
,
though
in
all
other
essential
it
be
my
write
memory
,
to
pursue
the
history
of
my
own
fiction
.
 
<EOS>
They
express
themselves
,
and
I
leave
them
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
when
I
refer
to
them
,
incidentally
,
it
be
only
as
a
part
of
my
progress
.
   
<EOS>
have
some
foundation
for
believe
,
by
this
time
,
that
nature
and
accident
have
make
me
an
author
,
I
pursue
my
vocation
with
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
without
such
assurance
I
should
certainly
have
leave
it
alone
,
and
bestow
my
energy
on
some
other
endeavour
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
try
to
find
out
what
nature
and
accident
really
have
make
me
,
and
to
be
that
,
and
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
write
,
in
the
newspaper
and
elsewhere
,
so
prosperously
,
that
when
my
new
success
be
achieve
,
I
consider
myself
reasonably
entitle
to
escape
from
the
dreary
debate
.
 
<EOS>
one
joyful
night
,
therefore
,
I
note
down
the
music
of
the
parliamentary
bagpipe
for
the
last
time
,
and
I
have
never
hear
it
since
;
though
I
still
recognize
the
old
drone
in
the
newspaper
,
without
any
substantial
variation
(
except
,
perhaps
,
that
there
be
more
of
it
)
,
all
the
livelong
session
.
   
<EOS>
I
now
write
of
the
time
when
I
have
be
marry
,
I
suppose
,
about
a
year
and
a
half
.
 
<EOS>
after
several
variety
of
experiment
,
we
have
give
up
the
housekeeping
as
a
bad
job
.
 
<EOS>
the
house
keep
itself
,
and
we
keep
a
page
.
 
<EOS>
the
principal
function
of
this
retainer
be
to
quarrel
with
the
cook
;
in
which
respect
he
be
a
perfect
Whittington
,
without
his
cat
,
or
the
remote
chance
of
be
make
Lord
Mayor
.
   
<EOS>
He
appear
to
me
to
have
live
in
a
hail
of
saucepan
-
lid
.
 
<EOS>
His
whole
existence
be
a
scuffle
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
shriek
for
help
on
the
most
improper
occasion
,
---
as
when
we
have
a
little
dinner
-
party
,
or
a
few
friend
in
the
evening
,
---
and
would
come
tumble
out
of
the
kitchen
,
with
iron
missile
fly
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
We
want
to
get
rid
of
him
,
but
he
be
very
much
attach
to
us
,
and
would
not
go
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
tearful
boy
,
and
break
into
such
deplorable
lamentation
,
when
a
cessation
of
our
connexion
be
hint
at
,
that
we
be
oblige
to
keep
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
mother
---
no
anything
in
the
way
of
a
relative
,
that
I
could
discover
,
except
a
sister
,
who
flee
to
America
the
moment
we
have
take
him
off
her
hand
;
and
he
become
quartered
on
us
like
a
horrible
young
changeling
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
lively
perception
of
his
own
unfortunate
state
,
and
be
always
rub
his
eye
with
the
sleeve
of
his
jacket
,
or
stoop
to
blow
his
nose
on
the
extreme
corner
of
a
little
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
which
he
never
would
take
completely
out
of
his
pocket
,
but
always
economize
and
secrete
.
   
<EOS>
this
unlucky
page
,
engage
in
an
evil
hour
at
six
pound
ten
per
annum
,
be
a
source
of
continual
trouble
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
watch
him
as
he
grow
---
and
he
grow
like
scarlet
bean
---
with
painful
apprehension
of
the
time
when
he
would
begin
to
shave
;
even
of
the
day
when
he
would
be
bald
or
grey
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
no
prospect
of
ever
get
rid
of
him
;
and
,
project
myself
into
the
future
,
use
to
think
what
an
inconvenience
he
would
be
when
he
be
an
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
I
never
expect
anything
less
,
than
this
unfortunate
's
manner
of
get
me
out
of
my
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
He
steal
Dora
's
watch
,
which
,
like
everything
else
belong
to
us
,
have
no
particular
place
of
its
own
;
and
,
convert
it
into
money
,
spend
the
produce
<EOS>
(
he
be
always
a
weak
-
minded
boy
)
in
incessantly
ride
up
and
down
between
London
and
Uxbridge
outside
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
take
to
Bow
Street
,
as
well
as
I
remember
,
on
the
completion
of
his
fifteenth
journey
;
when
four
-
and
-
sixpence
,
and
a
second
-
hand
fife
which
he
could
not
play
,
be
find
upon
his
person
.
   
<EOS>
the
surprise
and
its
consequence
would
have
be
much
less
disagreeable
to
me
if
he
have
not
be
penitent
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
very
penitent
indeed
,
and
in
a
peculiar
way
---
not
in
the
lump
,
but
by
instalment
.
 
<EOS>
for
example
:
the
day
after
that
on
which
I
be
oblige
to
appear
against
him
,
he
make
certain
revelation
touch
a
hamper
in
the
cellar
,
which
we
believe
to
be
full
of
wine
,
but
which
have
nothing
in
it
except
bottle
and
cork
.
 
<EOS>
We
suppose
he
have
now
ease
his
mind
,
and
tell
the
bad
he
know
of
the
cook
;
but
,
a
day
or
two
afterwards
,
his
conscience
sustain
a
new
twinge
,
and
he
disclose
how
she
have
a
little
girl
,
who
,
early
every
morning
,
take
away
our
bread
;
and
also
how
he
himself
have
be
suborn
to
maintain
the
milkman
in
coal
.
 
<EOS>
in
two
or
three
day
more
,
I
be
inform
by
the
authority
of
his
have
lead
to
the
discovery
of
sirloin
of
beef
among
the
kitchen
-
stuff
,
and
sheet
in
the
rag
-
bag
.
 
<EOS>
a
little
while
afterwards
,
he
break
out
in
an
entirely
new
direction
,
and
confess
to
a
knowledge
of
burglarious
intention
as
to
our
premise
,
on
the
part
of
the
pot
-
boy
,
who
be
immediately
take
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
to
be
so
ashamed
of
be
such
a
victim
<EOS>
,
that
I
would
have
give
him
any
money
to
hold
his
tongue
,
or
would
have
offer
a
round
bribe
for
his
be
permit
to
run
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
aggravate
circumstance
in
the
case
that
he
have
no
idea
of
this
,
but
conceive
that
he
be
make
me
amend
in
every
new
discovery
:
not
to
say
,
heap
obligation
on
my
head
.
   
<EOS>
at
last
I
run
away
myself
,
whenever
I
see
an
emissary
of
the
police
approach
with
some
new
intelligence
;
and
live
a
stealthy
life
until
he
be
try
and
order
to
be
transport
.
 
<EOS>
even
then
he
could
not
be
quiet
,
but
be
always
write
us
letter
;
and
want
so
much
to
see
Dora
before
he
go
away
,
that
Dora
go
to
visit
him
,
and
faint
when
she
find
herself
inside
the
iron
bar
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
have
no
peace
of
my
life
until
he
be
expatriate
,
and
make
(
as
I
afterwards
hear
)
a
shepherd
of
,
"
up
the
country
"
somewhere
;
I
have
no
geographical
idea
<EOS>
where
.
   
<EOS>
all
this
lead
me
into
some
serious
reflection
,
and
present
our
mistake
in
a
new
aspect
;
as
I
could
not
help
communicate
to
Dora
one
evening
,
in
spite
of
my
tenderness
for
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
love
,
"
say
I
,
"
it
be
very
painful
to
me
to
think
that
our
want
of
system
and
management
,
involve
not
only
ourselves
(
which
we
have
get
use
to
)
,
but
other
people
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
be
silent
for
a
long
time
,
and
now
you
be
go
to
be
cross
!
"
say
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
my
dear
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
let
me
explain
to
you
what
I
mean
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
do
not
want
to
know
,
"
say
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
I
want
you
to
know
,
my
love
.
 
<EOS>
Put
Jip
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
Dora
put
his
nose
to
mine
,
and
say
"
Boh
!
"
to
drive
my
seriousness
away
;
but
,
not
succeed
,
order
him
into
his
Pagoda
,
and
sit
look
at
me
,
with
her
hand
fold
,
and
a
most
resigned
little
expression
of
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
"
the
fact
be
,
my
dear
,
"
I
begin
,
"
there
be
contagion
in
us
.
 
<EOS>
We
infect
everyone
about
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
may
have
go
on
in
this
figurative
manner
,
if
Dora
's
face
have
not
admonish
me
that
she
be
wonder
with
all
her
may
whether
I
be
go
to
propose
any
new
kind
of
vaccination
,
or
other
medical
remedy
,
for
this
unwholesome
state
of
ours
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
I
check
myself
,
and
make
my
meaning
plainer
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
merely
,
my
pet
,
"
say
I
,
"
that
we
lose
money
and
comfort
,
and
even
temper
sometimes
,
by
not
learn
to
be
more
careful
;
but
that
we
incur
the
serious
responsibility
of
spoil
everyone
who
come
into
our
service
,
or
have
any
dealing
with
us
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
be
afraid
that
the
fault
be
not
entirely
on
one
side
,
but
that
these
people
all
turn
out
ill
because
we
do
not
turn
out
very
well
ourselves
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
what
an
accusation
,
"
exclaim
Dora
,
open
her
eye
wide
;
"
to
say
that
you
ever
see
me
take
gold
watch
!
<EOS>
oh
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
<EOS>
,
"
I
remonstrate
,
"
do
not
talk
preposterous
nonsense
!
<EOS>
who
have
make
the
least
allusion
to
gold
watch
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
,
"
return
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
You
say
I
have
not
turn
out
well
,
and
compare
me
to
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
to
whom
?
"
I
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
to
the
page
,
"
sob
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
you
cruel
fellow
,
to
compare
your
affectionate
wife
to
a
transported
page

<EOS>
why
do
not
you
tell
me
your
opinion
of
me
before
we
be
married
?
 
<EOS>
why
do
not
you
say
,
you
hard
-
hearted
thing
,
that
you
be
convinced
I
be
bad
than
a
transported
page
?
 
<EOS>
oh
,
what
a
dreadful
opinion
to
have
of
me
!
<EOS>
oh
,
my
goodness
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
Dora
,
my
love
,
"
I
return
,
gently
try
to
remove
the
handkerchief
she
press
to
her
eye
,
"
this
be
not
only
very
ridiculous
of
you
,
but
very
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
it
be
not
true
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
always
say
he
be
a
story
-
teller
,
"
sob
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
now
you
say
the
same
of
me
!
<EOS>
oh
,
what
shall
I
do
!
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
darling
girl
,
"
I
retort
,
"
I
really
must
entreat
you
to
be
reasonable
,
and
listen
to
what
I
do
say
,
and
do
say
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Dora
,
unless
we
learn
to
do
our
duty
to
those
whom
we
employ
,
they
will
never
learn
to
do
their
duty
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
we
present
opportunity
to
people
to
do
wrong
<EOS>
,
that
never
ought
to
be
present
.
 
<EOS>
even
if
we
be
as
lax
as
we
be
,
in
all
our
arrangement
,
by
choice
---
which
we
be
not
---
even
if
we
like
it
,
and
find
it
agreeable
to
be
so
---
<EOS>
which
we
do
not
<EOS>
---
I
be
persuade
we
should
have
no
right
to
go
on
in
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
positively
corrupt
people
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
bind
to
think
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
think
of
it
,
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
reflection
I
be
unable
to
dismiss
,
and
it
sometimes
make
me
very
uneasy
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
dear
,
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
come
now
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
be
foolish
!
"
   
<EOS>
Dora
would
not
allow
me
,
for
a
long
time
,
to
remove
the
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
She
sit
sob
and
murmur
behind
it
,
that
,
if
I
be
uneasy
,
why
have
I
ever
be
marry
?
 
<EOS>
why
have
not
I
say
,
even
the
day
before
we
go
to
church
,
that
I
know
I
should
be
uneasy
,
and
I
would
rather
not
?
 
<EOS>
if
I
could
not
bear
her
,
why
do
not
I
send
her
away
to
her
aunt
at
Putney
,
or
to
Julia
Mills
in
India
?
 
<EOS>
Julia
would
be
glad
to
see
her
,
and
would
not
call
her
a
transported
page
;
Julia
never
have
call
her
anything
of
the
sort
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
Dora
be
so
afflict
,
and
so
afflict
me
by
be
in
that
condition
,
that
I
feel
it
be
of
no
use
repeat
this
kind
of
effort
,
though
never
so
mildly
,
and
I
must
take
some
other
course
.
   
<EOS>
what
other
course
be
leave
to
take
?
 
<EOS>
to
"
form
her
mind
"
?
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
common
phrase
of
word
which
have
a
fair
and
promising
sound
,
and
I
resolve
to
form
Dora
's
mind
.
   
<EOS>
I
begin
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
when
Dora
be
very
childish
,
and
I
would
have
infinitely
prefer
to
humour
her
,
I
try
to
be
grave
---
and
disconcert
her
,
and
myself
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
talk
to
her
on
the
subject
which
occupy
my
thought
;
and
I
read
Shakespeare
to
her
---
and
fatigue
her
to
the
last
degree
.
 
<EOS>
I
accustom
myself
to
give
her
,
as
it
be
quite
casually
,
little
scrap
of
useful
information
,
or
sound
opinion
---
and
she
start
from
them
when
I
let
them
off
,
as
if
they
have
be
cracker
.
 
<EOS>
no
matter
how
incidentally
or
naturally
I
endeavour
to
form
my
little
wife
's
mind
,
I
could
not
help
see
that
she
always
have
an
instinctive
perception
of
what
I
be
about
,
and
become
a
prey
to
the
keen
apprehension
.
 
<EOS>
in
particular
,
it
be
clear
to
me
,
that
she
think
Shakespeare
a
terrible
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
the
formation
go
on
very
slowly
.
   
<EOS>
I
press
Traddles
into
the
service
without
his
knowledge
;
and
whenever
he
come
to
see
us
,
explode
my
mine
upon
him
for
the
edification
of
Dora
at
second
hand
.
 
<EOS>
the
amount
of
practical
wisdom
I
bestow
upon
Traddles
in
this
manner
be
immense
,
and
of
the
good
quality
;
but
it
have
no
other
effect
upon
Dora
than
to
depress
her
spirit
,
and
make
her
always
nervous
with
the
dread
that
it
would
be
her
turn
next
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
myself
in
the
condition
of
a
schoolmaster
,
a
trap
,
a
pitfall
;
of
always
play
spider
to
Dora
's
fly
,
and
always
pounce
out
of
my
hole
to
her
infinite
disturbance
.
   
<EOS>
still
,
look
forward
through
this
intermediate
stage
,
to
the
time
when
there
should
be
a
perfect
sympathy
between
Dora
and
me
,
and
when
I
should
have
"
form
her
mind
"
to
my
entire
satisfaction
,
I
persevere
,
even
for
month
.
 
<EOS>
find
at
last
,
however
,
that
,
although
I
have
be
all
this
time
a
very
porcupine
or
hedgehog
,
bristle
all
over
with
determination
,
I
have
effect
nothing
,
it
begin
to
occur
to
me
that
perhaps
Dora
's
mind
be
already
form
.
   
<EOS>
on
further
consideration
this
appear
so
likely
,
that
I
abandon
my
scheme
,
which
have
have
a
more
promising
appearance
in
word
than
in
action
;
resolve
henceforth
to
be
satisfied
with
my
child
-
wife
,
and
to
try
to
change
her
into
nothing
else
by
any
process
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
heartily
tired
of
be
sagacious
and
prudent
by
myself
,
and
of
see
my
darling
under
restraint
;
so
I
buy
a
pretty
pair
of
ear
-
ring
for
her
,
and
a
collar
for
Jip
,
and
go
home
one
day
to
make
myself
agreeable
.
   
<EOS>
Dora
be
delight
with
the
little
present
,
and
kiss
me
joyfully
;
but
there
be
a
shadow
between
us
,
however
slight
,
and
I
have
make
up
my
mind
that
it
should
not
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
if
there
must
be
such
a
shadow
anywhere
,
I
would
keep
it
for
the
future
in
my
own
breast
.
   
<EOS>
I
sit
down
by
my
wife
on
the
sofa
,
and
put
the
ear
-
ring
in
her
ear
;
and
then
I
tell
her
that
I
fear
we
have
not
be
quite
as
good
company
lately
,
as
we
use
to
be
,
and
that
the
fault
be
mine
.
<EOS>
which
I
sincerely
feel
,
and
which
indeed
it
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
the
truth
be
,
Dora
,
my
life
,
"
I
say
;
"
I
have
be
try
to
be
wise
.
"
   
"
<EOS>
and
to
make
me
wise
too
,
"
say
Dora
,
timidly
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
not
you
,
Doady
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
nod
assent
to
the
pretty

so
end
my
last
attempt

make
any

in
Dora

<EOS>
I
have
be
unhappy
in
try
it
;
I
could
not
endure
my
own
solitary
wisdom
;
I
could
not
reconcile
it
with
her
former
appeal
to
me
as
my
child
-
wife
.
 
<EOS>
I
resolve
to
do
what
I
could
,
in
a
quiet
way
,
to
improve
our
proceeding
myself
,
but
I
foresaw
that
my
utmost
would
be
very
little
,
or
I
must
degenerate
into
the
spider
again
,
and
be
for
ever
lie
in
wait
.
   
<EOS>
and
the
shadow
I
have
mention
,
that
be
not
to
be
between
us
any
more
,
but
be
to
rest
wholly
on
my
own
heart
?
 
<EOS>
how
do
that
fall
?
   
<EOS>
the
old
unhappy
feeling
pervade
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
deepen
,
if
it
be
change
at
all
;
but
it
be
as
undefined
as
ever
,
and
address
me
like
a
strain
of
sorrowful
music
faintly
hear
in
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
my
wife
dearly
,
and
I
be
happy
;
but
<EOS>
the
happiness
I
have
vaguely
anticipate
,
once
,
be
not
the
happiness
I
enjoy
,
and
there
be
always
something
want
.
   
<EOS>
in
fulfilment
of
the
compact
I
have
make
with
myself
,
to
reflect
my
mind
on
this
paper
,
I
again
examine
it
,
closely
,
and
bring
its
secret
to
the
light
.
 
<EOS>
what
I
miss
,
I
still
regard
<EOS>
---
I
always
regard
---
as
something
that
have
be
a
dream
of
my
youthful
fancy
;
that
be
incapable
of
realization
;
that
I
be
now
discover
to
be
so
,
with
some
natural
pain
,
as
all
man
do
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
it
would
have
be
well
for
me
if
my
wife
could
have
help
me
more
,
and
share
the
many
thought
in
which
I
have
no
partner
;
and
that
this
may
have
be
;
I
know
.
   
<EOS>
between
these
two
irreconcilable
conclusion
:
the
one
,
that
what
I
feel
be
general
and
unavoidable
;
the
other
,
that
it
be
particular
to
me
,
and
may
have
be
different
<EOS>
:
I
balance
curiously
,
with
no
distinct
sense
of
their
opposition
to
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
think
of
the
airy
dream
of
youth
that
be
incapable
of
realization
,
I
think
of
the
well
state
precede
manhood
that
I
have
outgrow
;
and
then
the
contented
day
with
agne
,
in
the
dear
old
house
,
arise
before
me
,
like
spectre
of
the
dead
,
that
may
have
some
renewal
in
another
world
,
but
never
more
could
be
reanimate
here
.
   
<EOS>
sometimes
,
the
speculation
come
into
my
thought
,
what
may
have
happen
,
or
what
would
have
happen
,
if
Dora
and
I
have
never
know
each
other
?
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
so
incorporated
with
my
existence
,
that
it
be
the
idlest
of
all
fancy
,
and
would
soon
rise
out
of
my
reach
and
sight
,
like
gossamer
float
in
the
air
.
   
<EOS>
I
always
love
her
.
 
<EOS>
what
I
be
describe
,
slumber
,
and
half
awoke
,
and
sleep
again
,
in
the
innermost
recess
of
my
mind
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
evidence
of
it
in
me
;
I
know
of
no
influence
it
have
in
anything
I
say
or
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
bear
the
weight
of
all
our
little
care
,
and
all
my
project
;
Dora
hold
the
pen
;
and
we
both
feel
that
our
share
be
adjust
as
the
case
require
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
truly
fond
of
me
,
and
proud
of
me
;
and
when
Agnes
write
a
few
earnest
word
in
her
letter
to
Dora
,
of
the
pride
and
interest
with
which
my
old
friend
hear
of
my
grow
reputation
,
and
read
my
book
as
if
they
hear
me
speak
its
content
,
Dora
read
them
out
to
me
with
tear
of
joy
in
her
bright
eye
,
and
say
I
be
a
dear
old
clever
,
famous
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
the
first
mistaken
impulse

an
undisciplined
heart

<EOS>
those
word
of
Mrs
Strong

constantly
recur
to
me
,
at
this

be
almost
always
present
to
my
mind

<EOS>
I
awake
with
them
,
often
,
in
the
night

I
remember
to
have
even
read
them
,
in
dream
,
inscribe
upon
the
wall
of
house
.
 
<EOS>
for
I
know
,
now
,
that
my
own
heart
be
undisciplined
when
it
first
love
Dora
;
and
that
if
it
have
be
discipline
,
it
never
could
have
feel
,
when
we
be
marry

what
it
have
feel
in
its
secret
experience

<EOS>
"
there
can
be
no
disparity
in
marriage

like
unsuitability
of
mind

purpose

<EOS>
those
word
I
remember
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
endeavour
to
adapt
Dora
to
myself
,
and
find
it
impracticable
.
 
<EOS>
It
remain
for
me
to
adapt
myself
to
Dora
;
to
share
with
her
what
I
could
,
and
be
happy
;
to
bear
on
my
own
shoulder
what
I
must
,
and
be
happy
still
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
discipline
to
which
I
try
to
bring
my
heart
,
when
I
begin
to
think
.
 
<EOS>
It
make
my
second
year
much
happy
than
my
first
;
and
,
what
be
well
still
,
make
Dora
's
life
all
sunshine

<EOS>
but
,
as
that
year
wear
on
,
Dora
be
not
strong
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
hope
that
light
hand
than
mine
would
help
to
mould
her
character
,
and
that
a
baby
-
smile
upon
her
breast
may
change
my
child
-
wife
to
a
woman
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be

<EOS>
the
spirit
flutter
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
of
its
little
prison

unconscious

wing

Dora

help
him
up

my

such

bark
himself
sideways

the
more
my

the

her

draw
one

upstairs

She
would
clasp
me
round

the

short

be
often

We
make
quite
a

but
,
sometimes

up

a
dead
blank

come
upon

numb
my

I
avoid
the
recognition
of

until

leave
her

I
sit
down

accede
to
this
the
more
readily

because
I
now
reproach
myself
with
have
treat
her
former
letter
rather
lightly

<EOS>
It
have
set
me
think
a
good
deal
at
the
time
,
as
I
have
mention
in
its
place
;
but
my
absorption
in
my
own
affair
,
my
experience
of
the
family
,
and
my
hearing
nothing
more
,
have
gradually
end
in
my
dismiss
the
subject

<EOS>
I
have
often
think
of
the
Micawbers
,

chiefly
to
wonder
what
"
pecuniary
liability
"
they
be
establish
in
Canterbury
,

to
recall
how
shy
Mr

be
of
me
when

become
clerk

now
write

into

number
of
speculation

I
need
not
repeat
.
 
<EOS>
We
take
my
aunt
into
our
counsel
in
the
afternoon
;
but
our
only
decide
conclusion
be
,
that
we
would
be
very
punctual
in
keep
Mr
Micawber
's
appointment
.
   
<EOS>
although
we
appear
at
the
stipulated
place

hour
before

time

we
find
Mr

already
there

be
stand
with

fold

over

look
at

his

Chapter

<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
's
dream
come
true
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
some
month
have
pass
since
our
interview
on
the
bank
of
the
river
with
Martha
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
see
her
since
,
but
she
have
communicate
with
Mr
Peggotty
on
several
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
have
come
of
her
zealous
intervention
;
nor
could
I
infer
,
from
what
he
tell
me
,
that
any
clue
have
be
obtain
,
for
a
moment
,
to
Emily
's
fate
.
 
<EOS>
I
confess
that
I
begin
to
despair
of
her
recovery
,
and
gradually
to
sink
deep
and
deep
into
the
belief
that
she
be
dead
.
   
<EOS>
His
conviction
remain
unchanged
.
 
<EOS>
so
far
as
I
know
---
and
I
believe
his
honest
heart
be
transparent
to
me
---
he
never
waver
again
,
in
his
solemn
certainty
of
find
her
.
 
<EOS>
His
patience
never
tired
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
although
I
tremble
for
the
agony
it
may
one
day
be
to
him
to
have
his
strong
assurance
shiver
at
a
blow
<EOS>
,
there
be
something
so
religious
in
it
,
so
affectingly
expressive
of
its
anchor
be
in
the
pure
depth
of
his
fine
nature
,
that
the
respect
and
honour
in
which
I
hold
him
be
exalt
every
day
.
   
<EOS>
His
be
not
a
lazy
trustfulness
that
hope
,
and
do
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
a
man
of
sturdy
action
all
his
life
,
and
he
know
that
in
all
thing
wherein
he
want
help
he
must
do
his
own
part
faithfully
,
and
help
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
know
him
set
out
in
the
night
,
on
a
misgiving
that
the
light
may
not
be
,
by
some
accident
,
in
the
window
of
the
old
boat
,
and
walk
to
Yarmouth
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
know
him
,
on
read
something
in
the
newspaper
that
may
apply
to
her
,
take
up
his
stick
,
and
go
forth
on
a
journey
of
three
or
four
score
mile
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
his
way
by
sea
to
Naples
,
and
back
,
after
hear
the
narrative
to
which
Miss
Dartle
have
assist
me
.
 
<EOS>
all
his
journey
be
ruggedly
perform
;
for
he
be
always
steadfast
in
a
purpose
of
save
money
for
Emily
's
sake
,
when
she
should
be
find
.
 
<EOS>
in
all
this
long
pursuit
,
I
never
hear
him
repine
;
I
never
hear
him
say
he
be
fatigue
,
or
out
of
heart
.
   
<EOS>
Dora
have
often
see
him
since
our
marriage
,
and
be
quite
fond
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
his
figure
before
me
now
,
stand
near
her
sofa
,
with
his
rough
cap
in
his
hand
,
and
the
blue
eye
of
my
child
-
wife
raise
,
with
a
timid
wonder
,
to
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
of
an
evening
,
about
twilight
,
when
he
come
to
talk
with
me
,
I
would
induce
him
to
smoke
his
pipe
in
the
garden
,
as
we
slowly
pace
to
and
fro
together
;
and
then
,
the
picture
of
his
deserted
home
,
and
the
comfortable
air
it
use
to
have
in
my
childish
eye
of
an
evening
when
the
fire
be
burn
,
and
the
wind
moan
round
it
,
come
most
vividly
into
my
mind
.
   
<EOS>
one
evening
,
at
this
hour
,
he
tell
me
that
he
have
find
Martha
wait
near
his
lodging
on
the
precede
night
when
he
come
out
,
and
that
she
have
ask
him
not
to
leave
London
on
any
account
,
until

should
have
see
her
again

inquire

ask

it
be

ever
say

she
on'y
get
my
promise

so
go
away
.

"
   
<EOS>
"
do
she
say
when
you
may
expect
to

her
again

I
demand
.
   
<EOS>
"
no

Mas'r
Davy

,
"
he
return
,
draw
his
hand
thoughtfully
down
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ask
that
too
;
but
it
be
more
(
she
say
)
than
she
could
tell
.

<EOS>
as
I
have
long
forborne
to
encourage
him
with
hope
that
hang
on
thread
,
I
make
no
other
comment
on
this
information
than
that
I
suppose
he
would
see
her
soon
.
 
<EOS>
such
speculation
as
it
engender
within
me
<EOS>
I
keep
to
myself
,
and
those
be
faint
enough
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
walk
alone
in
the
garden
,
one
evening
,
about
a
fortnight
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
that
evening
well
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
second
in
Mr
Micawber
's
week
of
suspense
.
 
<EOS>
there
have
be
rain
all
day
,
and
there
be
a
damp
feeling
in
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
the
leave
be
thick
upon
the
tree
,
and
heavy
with
wet
;
but
the
rain
have
cease
,
though
the
sky
be
still
dark
;
and
the
hopeful
bird
be
singe
cheerfully
.
<EOS>
as
I
walk
to
and
fro
in
the
garden
,
and
the
twilight
begin
to
close
around
me
,
their
little
voice
be
hush
;
and
that
peculiar
silence
which
belong
to
such
an
evening
in
the
country
when
the
light
tree
be
quite
still
,
save
for
the
occasional
dropping
from
their
bough
,
prevail
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
green
perspective
of
trellis
-
work
and
ivy
at
the
side
of
our
cottage
,
through
which
I
could
see
,
from
the
garden
where
I
be
walk
,
into
the
road
before
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
happen
to
turn
my
eye
towards
this
place
,
as
I
be
think
of
many
thing
;
and
I
see
a
figure
beyond
,
dress
in
a
plain
cloak
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
bend
eagerly
towards
me
,
and
beckoning
.
   
<EOS>
"
Martha
!
<EOS>
"
say
I
,
go
to
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
you
come
with
me
?
"
<EOS>
she
inquire
,
in
an
agitated
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
to
him
,
and
he
be
not
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
write
down
where
he
be
to
come

and
leave
it
on
his
table
with
my
own
hand
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
he
would
not
be
out
long
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
tiding
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
Can
you
come
directly
?
"
   
<EOS>
My
answer
be
,
to
pass
out
at
the
gate
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
She
make
a
hasty
gesture
with
her
hand
,
as
if
to
entreat
my
patience
and
my
silence
,
and
turn
towards
London
,
whence
,
as
her
dress
betoken
,
she
have
come
expeditiously
on
foot
.
   
<EOS>
I
ask
her
if
that
be
not
our
destination
?
 
<EOS>
on
her
motion
<EOS>
yes
,
with
the
same
hasty
gesture
as
before
,
I
stop
an
empty
coach
that
be
come
by
,
and
we
get
into
it
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
ask
her
where
the
coachman
be
to
drive
,
she
answer
,
"
anywhere
near
Golden
Square
!
<EOS>
and
quick
!
"
<EOS>
---
then
shrunk
into
a
corner
,
with
one
tremble
hand
before
her
face
,
and
the
other
make
the
former
gesture
,
as
if
she
could
not
bear
a
voice
.
   
<EOS>
now
much
disturbed
,
and
dazzle
with
conflicting
gleam
of
hope
and
dread
,
I
look
at
her
for
some
explanation
.
 
<EOS>
but
see
how
strongly
she
desire
to
remain
quiet
,
and
feeling
that
it
be
my
own
natural
inclination
too
,
at
such
a
time
,
I
do
not
attempt
to
break
the
silence
.
 
<EOS>
We
proceed
without
a
word
be
speak
.
<EOS>
sometimes
she
glance
out
of
the
window
,
as
though
she
think
we
be
go
slowly
,
though
indeed
we
be
go
fast
;
but
otherwise
remain
exactly
as
at
first
.
   
<EOS>
We
alight
at
one
of
the
entrance
to
the
Square
she
have
mention
,
where
I
direct
the
coach
to
wait
,
not
know
but
that
we
may
have
some
occasion
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
lay
her
hand
on
my
arm
,
and
hurry
me
on
to
one
of
the
sombre
street
,
of
which
there
be
several
in
that
part
,
where
the
house
be
once
fair
dwelling
in
the
occupation
of
single
family
,
but
have
,
and
have
,
long
degenerate
into
poor
lodging
let
off
in
room
.
 
<EOS>
enter
at
the
open
door
of
one
of
these
,
and
release
my
arm
,
she
beckon
me
to
follow
her
up
the
common
staircase
,
which
be
like
a
tributary
channel
to
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
the
house
swarm
with
inmate
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
go
up
,
door
of
room
be
open
and
people
's
head
put
out
;
and
we
pass
other
people
on
the
stair
,
who
be
come
down
.
 
<EOS>
in
glance
up
from
the
outside
,
before
we
enter
,
I
have
see
woman
and
child
loll
at
the
window
over
flower
-
pot
;
and
we
seem
to
have
attract
their
curiosity
,
for
these
be
principally
the
observer
who
look
out
of
their
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
broad
panel
staircase
,
with
massive
balustrade
of
some
dark
wood
;
cornice
above
the
door
,
ornament
with
carve
fruit
and
flower
;
and
broad
seat
in
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
but
all
these
token
of
past
grandeur
be
miserably
decay
and
dirty
;
<EOS>
rot
,
damp
,
and
age
,
have
weaken
the
flooring
,
which
in
many
place
be
unsound
and
even
unsafe
.
 
<EOS>
some
attempt
have
be
make
,
I
notice
,
to
infuse
new
blood
into
this
dwindle
frame
,
by
repair
the
costly
old
wood
-
work
here
and
there
with
common
deal
;
but
it
be
like
the
marriage
of
a
reduce
old
noble
to
a
plebeian
pauper
,
and
each
party
to
the
ill
-
assort
union
shrink
away
from
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
several
of
the
back
window
on
the
staircase
have
be
darken
or
wholly
block
up
.
 
<EOS>
in
those
that
remain
,
there
be
scarcely
any
glass
;
and
,
through
the
crumble
frame
by
which
the
bad
air
seem
always
to
come
in
,
and
never
to
go
out
,
I
see
,
through
other
glassless
window
,
into
other
house
in
a
similar
condition
,
and
look
giddily
down
into
a
wretched
yard
,
which
be
the
common
dust
-
heap
of
the
mansion
.
   
<EOS>
We
proceed
to
the
top
-
storey
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
two
or
three
time
,
by
the
way
,
I
think
I
observe
in
the
indistinct
light
the
skirt
of
a
female
figure
go
up
before
us
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
turn
to
ascend
the
last
flight
of
stair
between
us
and
the
roof
,
we
catch
a
full
view
of
this
figure
pause
for
a
moment
,
at
a
door
.
 
<EOS>
then
it
turn
the
handle
,
and
go
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
this
!
"
<EOS>
say
Martha
,
in
a
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
have
go
into
my
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
know
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
recognize
her
with
amazement
,
for
Miss
Dartle
.
   
<EOS>
I
say
something
to
the
effect
that
it
be
a
lady
whom
I
have
see
before
,
in
a
few
word
,
to
my
conductress
;
and
have
scarcely
do
so
,
when
we
hear
her
voice
in
the
room
,
though
not
,
from
where
we
stand
,
what
she
be
say
.
 
<EOS>
Martha
,
with
an
astonished
look
,
repeat
her
former
action
,
and
softly
lead
me
up
the
stair
;
and
then
,
by
a
little
back
-
door
which
seem
to
have
no
lock
,
and
which
she
push
open
with
a
touch
,
into
a
small
empty
garret
with
a
low
sloping
roof
,
little
well
than
a
cupboard
.
 
<EOS>
between
this
,
and
the
room
she
have
call
her
,
there
be
a
small
door
of
communication
,
stand
partly
open
.
 
<EOS>
here
we
stop
,
breathless
with
our
ascent
,
and
she
place
her
hand
lightly
on
my
lip
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
only
see
,
of
the
room
beyond
,
that
it
be
pretty
large
;
that
there
be
a
bed
in
it
;
and
that
there
be
some
common
picture
of
ship
upon
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
see
Miss
Dartle
,
or
the
person
whom
we
have
hear
her
address
.
 
<EOS>
certainly
,
my
companion
could
not
,
for
my
position
be
the
good
.
<EOS>
a
dead
silence
prevail
for
some
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Martha
keep
one
hand
on
my
lip
,
and
raise
the
other
in
a
listening
attitude
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
matter
little
to
me
<EOS>
her
not
be
at
home
,
"
say
Rosa
Dartle
haughtily
,
"
I
know
nothing
of
her

<EOS>
It
be
you
<EOS>
I
come
to
see

<EOS>
"
Me
?
"
reply
a
soft
voice
.
   
<EOS>
at
the
sound
of
it
,
a
thrill
go
through
my
frame
.
 
<EOS>
for
it
be
Emily
's
!
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
return
Miss
Dartle
,
"
I
have
come
to
look
at
you

<EOS>
what
?
<EOS>
You
be
not
ashamed
of
the
face
that
have
do
so
much
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
resolute
and
unrelenting
hatred
of
her
tone
,
its
cold
stern
sharpness
,
and
its
mastered
rage
,
present
her
before
me
,
as
if
I
have
see
her
standing
in
the
light
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
flash
black
eye
,
and
the
passion
-
waste
figure
;
and
I
see
the
scar
,
with
its
white
track
cut
through
her
lip
,
quivering
and
throbbing
as
she
speak
.
   
<EOS>
"
I

James

the
bold

flaunting

practise
companion

James
Steerforth

<EOS>
I
want
to
know
what
such
a

"
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
rustle
,
as
if
the
unhappy
girl
,
on
whom
she
heap
these
taunt
,
run
towards
the
door
,
and
the
speaker
swiftly
interpose
herself
before

It
be
succeed
by

moment
's
pause

when

it

through

set
tooth

with
a
stamp
upon

reach

I

not

what
to

<EOS>
much
as
I
desire
to
put
an
end
to
the
interview

I
feel
that
I

no

that
it

Would

Miss

in

within

downward

on

floor

I

fan
away

may
get

soon
recognize

at
this
signal

the

with
a
dexterity
that
be
next
to
marvellous
in
so
small
an
animal
,
whisk
the
chair
round
with
Mr

in
it
,
and
rattle
it
off
,
pell

mell
,
into
the
parlour
,
without

post
:
<EOS>
Mr

indescribably
enjoy
the
performance
,
and
look
back
at
me
on
the
road
as
if
it
be
the
triumphant
issue
of
his
life
's
exertion
.
   
<EOS>
after
a
stroll
about
the
town
I
go
to
Ham
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
have
now
remove
here
for
good
;
and
have
let
her
own
house
to
the
successor
of
Mr
Barkis
in
the
carrying
business
,
who
have
pay
her
very
well
for
the
good
-
will
,
cart
,
and
horse
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
the
very
same
slow
horse
that
Mr
Barkis
drive
be
still
at
work
.
   
<EOS>
I
find
them
in
the
neat
kitchen
,
accompany
by
Mrs
Gummidge
,
who
have
be
fetch
from
the
old
boat
by
Mr
Peggotty
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
if
she
could
have
be
induce
to
desert
her
post
,
by
anyone
else
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
evidently
tell
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
both
Peggotty
and
Mrs
Gummidge
have
their
apron
to
their
eye
,
and
Ham
have
just
step
out
"
to
take
a
turn
on
the
beach
"
.
 
<EOS>
He
presently
come
home
,
very
glad
to
see
me
;
and
I
hope
they
be
all
the
well
for
my
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
We
speak
,
with
some
approach
to
cheerfulness
,
of
Mr
Peggotty
's
grow
rich
in
a
new
country
,
and
of
the
wonder
he
would
describe
in
his
letter
.
 
<EOS>
We
say
nothing
of
Emily
by
name
,
but
distantly
refer
to
her
more
than
once
.
 
<EOS>
Ham
be
the
serene
of
the
party
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
Peggotty
tell
me
,
when
she
light
me
to
a
little
chamber
where
the
Crocodile
book
be
lie
ready
for
me
on
the
table
,
that
he
always
be
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
She
believe
(
she
tell
me
,
cry
)
that
he
be
break
-
hearted
;
though
he
be
as
full
of
courage
as
of
sweetness
,
and
work
harder
and
well
than
any
boat
-
builder
in
any
yard
in
all
that
part
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
time
,
she
say
,
of
an
evening
,
when
he
talk
of
their
old
life
in
the
boat
-
house
;
and
then
he
mention
Emily
as
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
he
never
mention
her
as
a
woman
.
   
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
read
in
his
face
that
he
would
like
to
speak
to
me
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
resolve
to
put
myself
in
his
way
next
evening
,
as
he
come
home
from
his
work
.
 
<EOS>
have
settle
this
with
myself
,
I
fall
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
that
night
,
for
the
first
time
in
all
those
many
night
,
the
candle
be
take
out
of
the
window
,
Mr
Peggotty
swing
in
his
old
hammock
in
the
old
boat
,
and
the
wind
murmur
with
the
old
sound
round
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
all
next
day
,
he
be
occupy
in
dispose
of
his
fishing
-
boat
and
tackle
;
in
pack
up
,
and
send
to
London
by
waggon
,
such
of
his
little
domestic
possession
as
he
think
would
be
useful
to
him
;
and
in
part
with
the
rest
,
or
bestow
them
on
Mrs
Gummidge
.
<EOS>
She
be
with
him
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
have
a
sorrowful
wish
to
see
the
old
place
once
more
,
before
it
be
lock
up
,
I
engage
to
meet
them
there
in
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
so
arrange
it
,
as
that
I
should
meet
Ham
first
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
come
in
his
way
,
as
I
know
where
he
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
meet
him
at
a
retire
part
of
the
sand
,
which
I
know
he
would
cross
,
and
turn
back
with
him
,
that
he
may
have
leisure
to
speak
to
me
if
he
really
wish
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
mistake
the
expression
of
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
walk
but
a
little
way
together
,
when
he
say
,
without
look
at
me
:
   
"
Mas'r
Davy
,
have
you
see
her
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
only
for
a
moment
,
when
she
be
in
a
swoon
,
"
I
softly
answer
.
   
<EOS>
We
walk
a
little
farther
,
and
he
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
Mas'r
Davy
,
shall
you
see
her
,
d'ye
think
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
too
painful
to
her
,
perhaps
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
thowt
of
that
,
"
he
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
so
'
twould
,
sir
,
so
'
twould
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
,
Ham
,
"
say
I
,
gently
,
"
if
there
be
anything
that
I
could
write
to
her
,
for
you
,
<EOS>
in
case
I
could
not
tell
it
;
if
there
be
anything
you
would
wish
to
make
known
to
her
through
me
;
I
should
consider
it
a
sacred
trust
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
on't
.
 
<EOS>
I
thankee

I
think
theer
be
something
I
could
wish

"
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
We
walk
a
little
farther
in
silence
,
and
then
he
speak
.
   
<EOS>
"
'
Tan't
that
I
forgive
her

<EOS>
'
Tan't
that
so
much

tis
more
as
I
beg
of
her
to
forgive
me

for
have
press
my
affection
upon
her

<EOS>
Odd
time
,
I
think
that
if
I
have
not
have
her
promise
fur
to
marry
me
,
sir
,
she
be
that
trustful
of
me
,
in
a
friendly
way
,
that
she
would
have
tell
me
what
be
struggle
in
her
mind

and
would
have
counsel
with
me
,
and
I
may
have
save
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
press
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
that
all
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Theer
be

he
return

"
if
I
can
say
it
,
Mas'r
Davy

"
   
<EOS>
We
walk
on
,
farther
than
we
have
walk
yet
,
before
he
speak
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
cry
when
he

<EOS>
"
I

I
love
the
mem'ry
of
her

too
deep

to

to
believe
of
my

I

not

bear
as

if
you

be
so
full
of
learning

Mas'r
Davy
,
could
think
of
anything
to
say
as
may
bring
her
to
believe
I
be
not
greatly
hurt
:
still
love
of
her
,
and
mourn
for
her
:
anything
as
may
bring
her
to
believe
as
I
be
not
tired
of
my
life

and
yet
be
hope
fur
to
see
her
without
blame
,
wheer
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
and
<EOS>
the
weary
be
at
rest
---
<EOS>
anything
as
would
ease
her
sorrowful
mind
,

yet
not
make
her
think
as
I
could
ever
marry
,
or
as
'
twas
possible
that
anyone
could
ever
be

me
<EOS>
what

I

<EOS>
I
press
his

Dick
,
Traddles
,
and
I
,
go
down
to
Canterbury
by
the
Dover
mail
that
night
.
   
<EOS>
at
the
hotel
where
Mr
Micawber
have
request
us
to
await
him
,
<EOS>
which
we
get
into
,
with
some
trouble
,
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
I
find
a
letter
,
import
that
he
would
appear
in
the
morning
punctually
at
half
past
nine
.
 
<EOS>
after
which
,
we
go
shiver
,
at
that
uncomfortable
hour
,
to
our
respective
bed
,
through
various
close
passage
;
which
smell
as
if
they
have
be
steep
,
for
age
,
in
a
solution
of
soup
and
stable
.
   
<EOS>
early
in
the
morning
,
I
saunter
through
the
dear
old
tranquil
street
,
and
again
mingle
with
the
shadow
of
the
venerable
gateway
and
church
.
 
<EOS>
the
rook
be
sail
about
the
cathedral
tower
;
and
the
tower
themselves
,
overlook
many
a
long
unaltered
mile
of
the
rich
country
and
its
pleasant
stream
,
be
cut
the
bright
morning
air
,
as
if
there
be
no
such
thing
as
change
on
earth
.
 
<EOS>
yet
the
bell
,
when
they
sound
,
tell
me
sorrowfully
of
change
in
everything
;
tell
me
of
their
own
age
,
and
my
pretty
Dora
's
youth
;
and
of
the
many
,
never
old
,
who
have
live
and
love
and
die
,
while
the
reverberation
of
the
bell
have
hum
through
the
rusty
armour
of
the
Black
Prince
hang
up
within
,
and
,
mote
upon
the
deep
of
Time
,
have
lose
themselves
in
air
,
as
circle
do
in
water
.
   
<EOS>
I
look
at
the
old
house
from
the
corner
of
the
street
,
but
do
not
go
nearer
to
it
,
l
,
be
observe
,
I
may
unwittingly
do
any
harm
to
the
design
I
have
come
to
aid
.
 
<EOS>
the
early
sun
be
strike
edgewise
on
its
gable
and
lattice
-
window
,
touch
them
with
gold
;
and
some
beam
of
its
old
peace
seem
to
touch
my
heart
.
   
<EOS>
I
stroll
into
the
country
for
an
hour
or
so
,
and
then
return
by
the
main
street
,
which
in
the
interval
have
shake
off
its
last
night
's
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
among
those
who
be
stir
in
the
shop
,
I
see
my
ancient
enemy
the
butcher
,
now
advanced
to
top
-
boot
and
a
baby
,
and
in
business
for
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
nurse
the
baby
,
and
appear
to
be
a
benignant
member
of
society
.
   
<EOS>
We
all
become
very
anxious
and
impatient
,
when
we
sit
down
to
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
approach
nearer
and
nearer
to
half
past
nine
o'clock
,
our
restless
expectation
of
Mr
Micawber
increase
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
we
make
no
more
pretence
of
attend
to
the
meal
,
which
,
except
with
Mr
Dick
,
have
be
a
mere
form
from
the
first
;
but
my
aunt
walk
up
and
down
the
room
<EOS>
,
Traddles
sit
upon
the
sofa
affect
to
read
the
paper
with
his
eye
on
the
ceiling
;
and
I
look
out
of
the
window
to
give
early
notice
of
Mr
Micawber
's
come
.
 
<EOS>
nor
have
I
long
to
watch
,
for
,
<EOS>
at
the
first
chime
of
the
half
hour
,
he
appear
in
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
"
here
he
be
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
not
in
his
legal
attire
!
"
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
tie
the
string
of
her
bonnet
(
she
have
come
down
to
breakfast
in
it
)
,
and
put
on
her
shawl
,
as
if
she
be
ready
for
anything
that
be
resolute
and
uncompromising
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
button
his
coat
with
a
determined
air
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
,
disturb
by
these
formidable
appearance
,
but
feel
it
necessary
to
imitate
them
,
pull
his
hat
,
with
both
hand
,
as
firmly
over
his
ear
as
he
possibly
could
;
and
instantly
take
it
off
again
,
to
welcome
Mr
Micawber
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
and

Mr
Micawber
,

him
on

to
the
bell
;

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dixon
be
so
well
pleased
with
his
new
name
,
and
appear
to
think
it
so
obliging
in
Mr
Micawber
to
confer
it
upon
him
,
that
he
shake
hand
with
him
again
,
and
laugh
rather
childishly
.

<EOS>
Mr

<EOS>
"

my
aunt
to
Mr

,
as
she
put
on
her

<EOS>
"
It

undoubtedly
the
fact

Traddles

to
whom
I
look
in
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr

have
consult

<EOS>

highly
so

Traddles

perhaps

under
such
circumstance

say
Mr
Micawber

"
you
will
do
me
the
favour

"
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
perfect
confidence

<EOS>
I
would
beg
to
be
allow
a
start
of
five
minute
by
the
clock
;
and
then
to
receive
the
present
company
,
inquire
for
Miss
Wickfield
,
at
the
office
of
Wickfield
and
Heep
,
whose
Stipendiary
I
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
and
I
look
at
Traddles
,
who
nod
his
approval
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
more
,
"
observe
Mr
Micawber
,
"
to
say
at
present
.
"
   
<EOS>
with
which
,
to
my
infinite
surprise
,
he
include
us
all
in
a
comprehensive
bow
,
and
disappear
;
his
manner
be
extremely
distant
,
and
his
face
extremely
pale
.
   
<EOS>
Traddles
only
smile
,
and
shake
his
head
(
with
his
hair
stand
upright
on
the
top
of
it
)
,
when
I
look
to
him
for
an
explanation
;
so
I
take
out
my
watch
,
and
,
as
a
last
resource
,
count
off
the
five
minute
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
with
her
own
watch
in
her
hand
,
do
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
time
be
expire
,
Traddles
give
her
his
arm
;
and
we
all
go
out
together
to
the
old
house
,
without
say
one
word
on
the
way
.
   
<EOS>
We
find
Mr
Micawber
at
his
desk
,
in
the
turret
office
on
the
ground
floor
,
either
writing
,
or
pretend
to
write
,
hard
.
 
<EOS>
the
large
office
-
ruler
be
stick
into
his
waistcoat
,
and
be
not
so
well
conceal
but
that
a
foot
or
more
of
that
instrument
protrude
from
his
bosom
,
like
a
new
kind
of
shirt
-
frill
.
   
<EOS>
as
it
appear
to
me
that
I
be
expect
to
speak
,
I
say
aloud
:
   
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
do
,
Mr
Micawber
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Copperfield

Mr

"
Mr

of
a
rheumatic
fever

;

but
Miss
Wickfield
<EOS>
,
I
have
no

,
will
be
happy
to
see
old
friend

<EOS>
Will
you
walk
in
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
precede
us
to
the
dining
-
room
---
the
first
room
I
have
enter
in
that
house
---
and
fling
open
the
door
of
Mr
Wickfield
's
former
office
,
say
,
in
a
sonorous
voice
:
   
"
Miss
Trotwood
,
Mr
David
Copperfield
,
Mr
Thomas
Traddles
,
and
Mr
Dixon
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
Uriah
Heep
since
the
time
of
the
blow
.
 
<EOS>
Our
visit
astonish
him
,
evidently
;
not
the
less
,
I
dare
say
,
because
it
astonish
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
gather
his
eyebrow
together
,
for
he
have
none
worth
mention
;
but
he
frown
to
that
degree
that
he
almost
close
his
small
eye
,
while
the
hurried
raising
of
his
grisly
hand
to
his
chin
betray
some
trepidation
or
surprise
.
<EOS>
this
be
only
when
we
be
in
the
act
of
enter
his
room
,
and
when
I
catch
a
glance
at
him
over
my
aunt
's
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
a
moment
afterwards
,
he
be
as
fawn
and
as
humble
as
ever
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
I
be
sure
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
indeed
an
unexpected
pleasure

<EOS>
to
have

as
I
may
say
,
all

St

Mrs

I

<EOS>
We

uneasy

poor
account

of
her
state

lately
,
I
do
assure
you

"
   
<EOS>
I
feel
ashamed
to

him
take
my

I
do
not

yet
what
else
to

I

pretty
constant
to

"

Uriah

writhe
in

You

Traddles

the
cunning

at
once
scrutinize
and
evade
us

<EOS>
no

Uriah

resume
his
official
seat
,
and
squeeze
his
bony
hand
,
lay
palm
to
palm
between
his
bony
knee
.
<EOS>
"
not
so
much
so
as
I
could
wish

but
lawyer

not
easily
satisfied

you
know

not

what
myself

Micawber
have
our
hand
pretty
full

in
general
,
on
account
of
Mr
Wickfield

be
hardly
fit

it

to
work

You
have
not

intimate

<EOS>

no

I
have
not

return
Traddles
;
"
or
I
may
perhaps
have
wait
on
you
long
ago

Mr
Heep

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
the
tone
of
this
reply
,
which
make
Uriah
look
at
the
speaker
again
,
with
a
very
sinister
and
suspicious
expression
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
see
only
Traddles
,
with
his
good
-
natured
face
,
simple
manner
,
and
hair
on
end
,
he
dismiss
it
as
he
reply
,
with
a
jerk
of
his
whole
body
,
but
especially
his
throat
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
for
that
,
Mr
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
have
admire
him
as
much
as
we
all
do
.
 
<EOS>
His
little
failing
would
only
have
endear
him
to
you
the
more
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
you
would
like
to
hear
my
fellow
-
partner
eloquently
speak
of
,
I
should
refer
you
to
Copperfield
.
 
<EOS>
the
family
be
a
subject
<EOS>
he
be
very
strong
upon
,
if
you
never
hear
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
prevent
from
disclaim
the
compliment
(
if
I
should
have
do
so
,
in
any
case
)
,
by
the
entrance
of
agne
,
now
usher
in
by
Mr
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
not
quite
so
self
-
possess
as
usual
,
I
think
;
and
have
evidently
undergo
anxiety
and
fatigue
.
 
<EOS>
but
her
earnest
cordiality
,
and
her
quiet
beauty
,
shine
with
the
gentler
lustre
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
see
Uriah
watch
her
while
she
greet
us
;
and
he
remind
me
of
an
ugly
and
rebellious
genie
watch
a
good
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
meanwhile
,
some
slight
sign
pass
between
Mr
Micawber

Traddles

off

nothing

when

pass
on

I
must

not

observe

that

We
talk
about

tyranny

we
like

tyrannize

we
be
fond
of
have
a
large
superfluous
establishment

wait
upon

great
occasion

we
think
it
look
important

sound
well

as
we
be
not
particular
about
the
meaning
of
our

on

if
they
be

fine

numerous
enough
,
so
,
the
meaning

a
secondary
consideration

there
be

mention

what

could
rush

both

"

there

one
question

my

I
could
wish
to
ask

"

Mrs

<EOS>
"
the

say
my

<EOS>
"
just
so
,
"
return
Mrs

.
 
<EOS>
"
then
my
question
arise
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
be
the
circumstance
of
the
country
such
,
that
a
man
of
Mr
Micawber
's
ability
would
have
a
fair
chance
of
rise
in
the
social
scale
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
,
at
present
,
may
he
aspire
to
be
Governor
,
or
anything
of
that
sort
;
but
would
there
be
a
reasonable
opening
for
his
talent
to
develop
themselves
---
that
would
be
amply
sufficient
---
and
find
their
own
expansion
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
better
open
anywhere
,
"
say
my
aunt
,
"
for
a
man
who
conduct
himself
well
,
and
be
industrious
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
for
a
man
who
conduct
himself
well
,
"
repeat
Mrs
Micawber
,
with
her
clear
business
manner
,
"
and
be
industrious
.
 
<EOS>
precisely
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
evident
to
me
that
Australia
be
the
legitimate
sphere
of
action
for
Mr
Micawber
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
entertain
the
conviction
,
my
dear
madam
,
"
say
Mr
Micawber
,
"
that
it
be
,
under
exist
circumstance
,
the
land
,
the
only
land
,
for
myself
and
family
;
<EOS>
and
that
something
of
an
extraordinary
nature
will
turn
up
on
that
shore
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
distance
---
comparatively
speak
;
and
though
consideration
be
due
to
the
kindness
of
your
proposal
,
I
assure
you
that
be
a
mere
matter
of
form
.
"
   
<EOS>
Shall
I
ever
forget
how
,
in
a
moment
,
he
be
the
most
sanguine
of
man
,
look
on
to
fortune
;
or
how
Mrs
Micawber
presently
discourse
about
the
habit
of
the
kangaroo
!
<EOS>
Shall
I
ever
recall
that
street
of
Canterbury
on
a
market
-
day
,
without
recall
him
,
as
he
walk
back
with
us
;
express
,
in
the
hardy
roving
manner
he
assume
,
the
unsettled
habit
of
a
temporary
sojourner
in
the
land
;
and
look
at
the
bullock
,
as
they
come
by
,
with
the
eye
of
an
australian
farmer
!

Chapter
53
.
<EOS>
another
retrospect
 
<EOS>
I
must
pause
yet
once
again
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
my
child
-
wife
,
there
be
a
figure
in
the
move
crowd
before
my
memory
,
quiet
and
still
,
say
in
its
innocent
love
and
childish
beauty
,
stop
to
think
of
me
---
turn
to
look
upon
the
Little
Blossom
,
as
it
flutter
to
the
ground
!
   
<EOS>
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
all
else
grow
dim
,
and
fade
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
again
with
Dora
,
in
our
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
long
she
have
be
ill
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
used
to
it
in
feeling
,
that
I
can
not
count
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
really
long
,
in
week
or
month
;
but
,
in
my
usage
and
experience
,
it
be
a
weary
,
weary
while
.
   
<EOS>
They
have
leave
off
tell
me
to
"
wait
a
few
day
more
"
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
begin
to
fear
,
remotely
,
that
the
day
may
never
shine
,
when
I
shall
see
my
child
-
wife
run
in
the
sunlight
with
her
old
friend
Jip
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
,
as
it
be
suddenly
,
grow
very
old
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
he
miss
in
his
mistress
,
something
that
enliven
him
and
make
him
young
;
but
he
mope
,
and
his
sight
be
weak
,
and
his
limb
be
feeble
,
and
my
aunt
be
sorry
that
he
object
to
her
no
more
,
but
creep
near
her
as
he
lie
on
Dora
's
bed
<EOS>
---
she
sit
at
the
bedside
---
and
mildly
lick
her
hand

<EOS>
Dora
lie
smile
on
us

and
be
beautiful
,
and
utter
no

<EOS>
She
say
that
we
be
very
good

that
her

old
careful

tire
himself

that
my

have
no

be
always
wakeful

active

and
kind
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
the
little
bird
-
like
lady
come
to
see
her
;
and
then
we
talk
about
our
wedding
-
day
,
and
all
that
happy
time
.
   
<EOS>
what
a
strange
rest
and
pause
in
my
life
there
seem
to
be
---
and
in
all
life
,
within
door
and
without
---
when
I
sit
in
the
quiet
,
shaded
,
orderly
room
,
with
the
blue
eye
of
my
child

wife
turn
towards
me
,
and
her
little
finger
twine
round
my
hand
!
<EOS>
many
and
many
an
hour
I
sit
thus
;
but
,
of
all
those

,
three

come
the
fresh
on

<EOS>
It
be

Dora

make
so
trim
by
my

show
me
how
her
pretty
hair
will
curl
upon
the
pillow
yet
,
an
how
long
and
bright
it
be
,
and
how
she
like
to
have
it
loosely
gather
in
that
net
she
wear
.
   
<EOS>
"
not

I
be
vain
of

now

you
mock

she
say
,
when
I
smile
;
"
but
because
you
use
to
say
you
think
it
so
beautiful
;
and
because
,
when
I
first
begin
to
think
about
you
,
I
use
to
peep
in
the
glass
,
and
wonder
whether
you
would
like
very
much
to
have
a
lock
of
it

They
have
tell

so

they
have
tell
me
nothing
new

my

I
be
far
from
sure

I
have
take
that
truth

I

it

I

remember

bethink

resign
myself

console
myself

that

do
imperfectly

that

come

I

out

I

<EOS>
I
try
to
stay
my
tear

to

I
may

,
as
year
go

my

would
have
weary

She

less

Would

More

Chapter
54
.
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
's
transaction
 
<EOS>
this
be
not
the
time
at
which
I
be
to
enter
on
the
state
of
my
mind
beneath
its
load
of
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
to
think
that
the
Future
be
wall
up
before
me
,
that
the
energy
and
action
of
my
life
be
at
an
end
,
that
I
never
could
find
any
refuge
but
in
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
to
think
so
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
but
not
in
the
first
shock
of
my
grief
.
<EOS>
It
slowly
grow
to
that
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
event
I
go
on
to
relate
,
have
not
thicken
around
me
,
in
the
beginning
to
confuse
,
and
in
the
end
to
augment
,
my
affliction
,
it
be
possible
(
though
I
think
not
probable
)
,
that
I
may
have
fall
at
once
into
this
condition
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
an
interval
occur
before
I
fully
know
my
own
distress
;
an
interval
,
in
which
I
even
suppose
that
its
sharp
pang
be
past
;
and
when
my
mind
could
soothe
itself
by
rest
on
all
that
be
most
innocent
and
beautiful
,
in
the
tender
story
that
be
close
for
ever
.
   
<EOS>
when
it
be
first
propose
that
I
should
go
abroad
,
or
how
it
come
to
be
agree
among
us
that
I
be
to
seek
the
restoration
of
my
peace
in
change
and
travel
,
I
do
not
,
even
now
,
distinctly
know
.
<EOS>
the
spirit
of
Agnes
so
pervade
all
we
think
,
and
say
,
and
do
,
in
that
time
of
sorrow
,
that
I
assume
I
may
refer
the
project
to
her
influence
.
 
<EOS>
but
her
influence
be
so
quiet
that
I
know
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
and
now
,
indeed
,
I
begin
to
think
that
in
my
old
association
of
her
with
the
stain
-
glass
window
in
the
church
,
a
prophetic
foreshadowing
of
what
she
would
be
to
me
,
in
the
calamity
that
be
to
happen
in
the
fullness
of
time
,
have
find
a
way
into
my
mind
.
<EOS>
in
all
that
sorrow
,
from
the
moment
,
never
to
be
forget
,
when
she
stand
before
me
with
her
upraised
hand
,
she
be
like
a
sacred
presence
in
my
lonely
house
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
Angel
of
Death
alight
there
,
my
child
-
wife
fall
asleep
---
they
tell
me
so
when
I
could
bear
to
hear
it
---
on
her
bosom
,
with
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
from
my
swoon
,
I
first
awake
to
a
consciousness
of
her
compassionate
tear
,
her
word
of
hope
and
peace
,
her
gentle
face
bend
down
as
from
a
purer
region
near
Heaven
,
over
my
undisciplined
heart
,
and
soften
its
pain
.
   
<EOS>
let
me
go
on
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
to
go
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
that
seem
to
have
be
determine
among
us
from
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
the
ground
now
cover
all
that
could
perish
of
my
depart
wife
<EOS>
,
I
wait
only
for
what
Mr
Micawber
call
the
"
final
pulverization
of
heep
"
;
and
for
the
departure
of
the
emigrant

perhaps
I

express
the
conclusion

Mrs

your

I

add
our

reconsider
that
important
business

point

would
beg
to
propose
my
note

draw
,
it
be
needless

on

twenty

four

<EOS>
the
proposition

twelve

eighteen

four

I

something

my

,
that
the
gulf

to

apprehension

accommodation

deep
sagacity

that
there

of
commence

me

His

the
fact

Traddles

Mr

have
so
completely
hem
him
in

be
always
ready

so
many
new
point
if
an
old
one
fail
,
that
he
could
not
escape
from
us

<EOS>
a
most
remarkable
circumstance
be
,
that
I
really
do
not
think
he
grasp
this
sum
even
so
much
for
the
gratification
of
his
avarice
,
which
be
inordinate
,
as
in
the
hatred
he
feel
for
Copperfield

He
say
so
to
me

plainly
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
he
would
even
have
spend
as
much

to
baulk
or
injure
Copperfield

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
ha
!
"
say
my
aunt
,
knit
her
brow
thoughtfully

glance
at
Agnes

<EOS>
"
and
what
be
become
of
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know

<EOS>
He
leave
here
,
"
say
Traddles
,
"
with
his
mother
,
who
have
be
clamour
,

beseeching

disclose

the
whole

<EOS>
They
go
away
by
one
of
the
London
night
coach

I
know
no
more
about
him
;
except
that
his
malevolence
to
me
at
parting
be
audacious
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
to
consider
himself
hardly
less
indebted
to
me
,
than
to
Mr
Micawber
;
which
I
consider
(
as
I
tell
him
)
quite
a
compliment
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
suppose
he
have
any
money
,
Traddles
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
dear
,
yes
,
I
should
think
so
,
"
he
reply
,
shake
his
head
,
seriously
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
he
must
have
pocket
a
good
deal
,
in
one
way
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
I
think
you
would
find
,
Copperfield
,
if
you
have
an
opportunity
of
observe
his
course
,
that
money
would
never
keep
that
man
out
of
mischief
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
such
an
incarnate
hypocrite
,
that
whatever
object
he
pursue
,
he
must
pursue
crookedly
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
his
only
compensation
for
the
outward
restraint
he
put
upon
himself
.
<EOS>
always
creep
along
the
ground
to
some
small
end
or
other
,
he
will
always
magnify
every
object
in
the
way
;
and
consequently
will
hate
and
suspect
everybody
that
come
,
in
the
most
innocent
manner
,
between
him
and
it
.
 
<EOS>
so
the
crooked
course
will
become
crookeder
,
at
any
moment
,
for
the
least
reason
,
or
for
none
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
necessary
to
consider
his
history
here
,
"
say
Traddles
,
"
to
know
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
monster
of
meanness

my

<EOS>

really
I
do
not
know
about

traddle

"
many
people
can
be
very
mean

now

touch
Mr

my

<EOS>

Traddles

cheerfully

I
must
,
once
more

give
Mr

high
praise

for
his
have
be
so
patient

long
a

we
never
could
have
hope

do

worth

I

ought

consider

Mr

do
right
,
for
right

when
we
reflect
what
term
he
may
have
make
with
Uriah
Heep
himself

silence

<EOS>

I

so
too

now

what
would
you
give

inquire
my

before

little
disconcerted

I
be
afraid

it
discreet

omit
(
not

able

carry
everything

two
point

in

yes

I
do
not
know
when
they
may
be

on
,

where
they
be

"
rejoin
traddle
,
open
his
eye
;
"
and
I
anticipate
,
that
,
between
this
time
and
his
departure
,
Mr
Micawber
will
be
constantly
arrest
,
or
take
in
execution
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
then
he
must
be
constantly
set
free
again

take
out
of
execution
,
"
say
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
amount
altogether
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
Mr
Micawber
have
enter
the
transaction
---
he
call
them
transaction
---
with
great
form
,
in
a
book
,
"
rejoin
traddle
,
smile
;
"
and
he
make
the
amount
a
hundred
and
three
pound
,
five
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
what
shall
we
give
him
,
that
sum
include
?
"
say
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
agne
,
my
dear
,
you
and
I
can
talk
about
division
of
it
afterwards

<EOS>
what
should
it
be
?
 
<EOS>
five
hundred
pound
?
"
   
<EOS>
upon
this
,
Traddles
and
I
both
strike
in
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
We
both
recommend
a
small
sum
in
money
,
and
the
payment
,
without
stipulation
to
Mr
Micawber
,
of
the
Uriah
claim
as
they
come
in
.
<EOS>
We
propose
that
the
family
should
have
their
passage
and
their
outfit
,
and
a
hundred
pound
;
and
that
Mr
Micawber
's
arrangement
for
the
repayment
of
the
advance
should
be
gravely
enter
into
,
as
it
may
be
wholesome
for
him
to
suppose
himself
under
that
responsibility
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
,
I
add
the
suggestion
,
that
I
should
give
some
explanation
of
his
character
and
history
to
Mr
Peggotty
,
who
I
know
could

and
that
to
Mr
Peggotty
should
be
quietly
entrust
the
discretion
of
advance
another
hundred
.
 
<EOS>
I
further
propose
to
interest
Mr
Micawber
in
Mr
Peggotty
,
by
confide
so
much
of
Mr
Peggotty
's
story
to
him
as
I
may
feel
justified
in
relate
,
or
may
think
expedient
;
and
to
endeavour
to
bring
each
of
them
to
bear
upon
the
other
,
for
the
common
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
enter
warmly
into
these
view
;
and
I
may
mention
at
once
,
that
the
principal
themselves
do
so
,
shortly
afterwards
,
with
perfect
good
will
and
harmony
.
   
<EOS>
see
that
Traddles
now
glance
anxiously
at
my
aunt
again
,
I
remind
him
of
the
second
and
last
point
to
which
he
have
advert
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
and
your
aunt
will
excuse
me

Copperfield

if
I
touch

painful
theme

as
I
greatly
fear
I
shall
,
"
say
Traddles
,
hesitating
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
think
it
necessary
to
bring
it
to
your
recollection
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
day
of
Mr
Micawber
's
memorable
denunciation
a
threatening

My

retain
her

assent
with
a
nod

perhaps

observe

it

impertinence

<EOS>
"
yes

my
good
friend

say
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
Traddles
,
with
a
perceptible
lengthening
of
his
face
,
explain
that
he
have
not
be
able
to
approach
this
subject
;
that
it
have
share
the
fate
of
Mr
Micawber
's
liability
,
in
not

comprehend
in
the
term
he
have
make
;
that
we
be
no
long
of
any
authority
with
Uriah

and
that
if
he
could
do
us
,
or
any
of
us
,
any
injury
or
annoyance
,
no
doubt
he
would
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
remain
quiet
;
until
again
some
stray
tear
find
their
way
to
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
quite
right

"
she
say

<EOS>
"
It
be
very
thoughtful
to
mention
it

<EOS>
"
Can
I

do
anything
?

<EOS>
ask
Traddles

gently
.
   
<EOS>
"
nothing

my

"
I

the
awakening

It

We
pass
the

free
from

seem
purged
of
a

I

We

at

accordingly
,
we
go
out

<EOS>
We
drive
a

We
take

at

I
now
approach
an
event
in
my

so
indelible

so
awful

so
bind
by
an
infinite
variety
of
tie
to
all
that
have
precede

that
,
from
the
beginning
of
my
narrative

I
have
see
it
grow
large
and
large
as
I
advance
,
like
a
great
tower
in
a
plain
,
and
throw
its
fore
-
cast
shadow
even
on
the
incident
of
my
childish
day

<EOS>
for
year
after
it
occur

I
dream
of
it
often

I
have
start
up
so
vividly
impressed
by
it

that
its
fury
have
yet
seem
rage
in

in

still
night

I
dream

it
sometimes

at
lengthened

uncertain
interval

to
this

<EOS>
I
have
an
association
between
it
and
a
stormy
wind
,
or
the
light
mention
of
a
sea

shore
,
as
strong
as
any

my

be
conscious

plainly

I
behold
what
happen

I
will
try

write
it
down

I
do
not
recall
it

see
it
do

for
it
happen
again
before

draw
on
rapidly

she
,
who
be
so
much
with
him
,
have
to
relate
,
be
equal
to
her
in
relate
them
.
   
<EOS>
my
aunt
<EOS>
and
I
be
at
that
time
vacate
the
two
cottage
at
Highgate
;
I
intend
to
go
abroad
,
and
she
to
return
to
her
house
at
Dover
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
a
temporary
lodging
in
Covent
Garden
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
walk
home
to
it
,
after
this
evening
's
conversation
,
reflect
on
what
have
pass
between
Ham
and
myself
when
I
be
last
at
Yarmouth
,
I
waver
in
the
original
purpose
I
have
form
,
of
leave
a
letter
for
Emily
when
I
should
take
leave
of
her
uncle
on
board
the
ship
,
and
think
it
would
be
well
to
write
to
her
now
.
 
<EOS>
She
may
desire
,
I
think
,
after
receive
my
communication
,
to
send
some
part
word
by
me
to
her
unhappy
lover
.
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
give
her
the
opportunity
.
   
<EOS>
I
therefore
sit
down
in
my
room
,
before
go
to
bed
,
and
write
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
that
I
have
see
him
,
and
that
he
have
request
me
to
tell
her
what
I
have
already
write
in
its
place
in
these
sheet
.
 
<EOS>
I
faithfully
repeat
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
need
to
enlarge
upon
it
,
if
I
have
have
the
right
.
 
<EOS>
Its
deep
fidelity
and
goodness
be
not
to
be
adorn
by
me
or
any
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
leave
it
out
,
to
be
send
round
in
the
morning
;
with
a
line
to
Mr
Peggotty
,
request
him
to
give
it
to
her
;
and
go
to
bed
at
daybreak
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
weak
than
I
know
then
;
and
,
not
fall
asleep
until
the
sun
be
up
,
lie
late
,
and
unrefreshed
,
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
rouse
by
the
silent
presence
of
my
aunt
at
my
bedside
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
it
in
my
sleep
,
as
I
suppose
we
all
do
feel
such
thing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Trot

,
when
I
open

I

My

<EOS>
though
he
anxiously
endeavour

I
see

be

this

if
I
have
require

He
go
round

at
my

take
the
box

seat

in

evening
I

traverse
under
so
many
vicissitude

<EOS>
"

I
ask
the
coachman

in

first
stage
out

"
a

remarkable
sky

I

<EOS>
there
will
be
mischief
do
at

I

before

"
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
murky
confusion
---
here
and
there
blot
with
a
colour
like
the
colour
of
the
smoke
from
damp
fuel
---
of
fly
cloud
,
<EOS>
toss
up
into
most
remarkable
heap
,
suggest
great
height
in
the
cloud
than
there
be
depth
below
them
to
the
bottom
of
the
deep
hollow
in
the
earth
,
through
which
the
wild
moon
seem
to
plunge
headlong
,
as
if
,
in
a
dread
disturbance
of
the
law

nature

she

lose
her
way

frightened

<EOS>
there
have
be
a
wind
all
day

and
it
be
rise
then
,
with
an
extraordinary
great
sound
.
 
<EOS>
in
another
hour
it
have
much
increase
,
and
the
sky
be
more
overcast
,
and
blow
hard
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
as
the
night
advance
,
the
cloud
close
in
and
densely
over
-
spread
the
whole
sky
,
then
very
dark
,
it
come
on
to
blow
,
harder
and
harder
.
 
<EOS>
It
still
increase
,
until
our
horse
could
scarcely
face
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
many
time
,
in
the
dark
part
of
the
night
(
it
be
then
late
in
September
,
when
the
night
be
not
short
)
,
the
leader
turn
about
,
or
come
to
a
dead
stop
;
and
we
be
often
in
serious
apprehension
that
the
coach
would
be
blow
over
.
<EOS>
sweeping
gust
of
rain
come
up
before
this
storm
,
like
shower
of
steel
;
and
,
at
those
time
,
when
there
be
any
shelter
of
tree
or
lee
wall
to
be
get
,
we
be
fain
to
stop
,
in
a
sheer
impossibility
of
continue
the
struggle
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
day
break
,
it
blow
harder
and
harder
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
in
Yarmouth
when
the
seaman
say
it
blow
great
gun
,
but
I
have
never
know
the
like
of
this
,
or
anything
approach
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
come
to
Ipswich
---
very
late
,
have
have
to
fight
every
inch
of
ground
since
we
be
ten
mile
out
of
London
;
and
find
a
cluster
of
people
in
the
market
-
place
,
who
have
rise
from
their
bed
in
the
night
,
fearful
of
fall
chimney
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
these
,
congregate
about
the
inn
-
yard
while
we
change
horse
,
tell
us
of
great
sheet
of
lead
have
be
rip
off
a
high
church
-
tower
,
and
fling
into
a
by
-
street
,
which
they
then
block
up
.
 
<EOS>
other
have
to
tell
of
country
people
,
come
in
from
neighbouring
village
,
who
have
see
great
tree
lie
tear
out
of
the
earth
,
and
whole
rick
scatter
about
the
road
and
field
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
there
be
no
abatement
in
the
storm
,
but
it
blow
harder
.
   
<EOS>
as
we
struggle
on
,
near
and
near
to
the
sea
,
from
which
this
mighty
wind
be
blow
dead
on
shore
,
its
force
become
more
and
more
terrific
.
 
<EOS>
long
before
we
see
the
sea
,
its
spray
be
on
our
lip
,
and
shower
salt
rain
upon
us
.
 
<EOS>
the
water
be
out
,
over
mile
and
mile
of
the
flat
country
adjacent
to
Yarmouth
;
and
every
sheet
and
puddle
lash
its
bank
,
and
have
its
stress
of
little
breaker
set
heavily
towards
us
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
come
within
sight
of
the
sea
,
the
wave
on
the
horizon
,
catch
at
interval
above
the
rolling
abyss
,
be
like
glimpse
of
another
shore
with
tower
and
building
.
 
<EOS>
when
at
last
we
get
into
the
town
,
the
people
come
out
to
their
door
,
all
aslant
,
and
with
streaming
hair
,
make
a
wonder
of
the
mail
that
have
come
through
such
a
night
.
   
<EOS>
I
put
up
at
the
old
inn
,
and
go
down
to
look
at
the
sea
;
stagger
along
the
street
,
which
be
strew
with
sand
and
seaweed
,
and
with
fly
blotch
of
sea
-
foam
;
afraid
of
fall
slate
and
tile
;
and
hold
by
people
I
meet
,
at
angry
corner
.
<EOS>
come
near
the
beach
,
I
see
,
not
only
the
boatman
,
but
half
the
people
of
the
town
,
lurk
behind
building
;
some
,
now
and
then
brave
the
fury
of
the
storm
to
look
away
to
sea
,
and
blow
sheer
out
of
their
course
in
try
to
get
zigzag
back
.
   
<EOS>
join
these
group
,
I
find
bewailing
woman
whose
husband
be
away
in
herring
or
oyster
boat
,
which
there
be
too
much
reason
to
think
may
have
founder
before
they
could
run
in
anywhere
for
safety
.
 
<EOS>
grizzle
old
sailor
be
among
the
people
,
shake
their
head
,
as
they
look
from
water
to
sky
,
and
mutter
to
one
another
;
ship
-
owner
,
excited
and
uneasy
;
child
,
huddle
together
,
and
peer
into
old
face
;
even
stout
mariner
,
disturbed
and
anxious
,
level
their
glass
at
the
sea
from
behind
place
of
shelter
,
as
if
they
be
survey
an
enemy
.
   
<EOS>
the
tremendous
sea
itself
,
when
I
could
find
sufficient
pause
to
look
at
it
,
in
the
agitation
of
the
blind
wind
,
the
fly
stone
and
sand
,
and
the
awful
noise
,
confound
me
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
high
watery
wall
come
roll
in
,
and
,
at
their
high
,
tumble
into
surf
,
they
look
as
if
the
least
would
engulf
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
recede
wave
sweep
back
with
a
hoarse
roar
,
it
seem
to
scoop
out
deep
cave
in
the
beach
,
as
if
its
purpose
be
to
undermine
the
earth
.
 
<EOS>
when
some
white
-
head
billow
thunder
on
,
and
dash
themselves
to
piece
before
they
reach
the
land
,
every
fragment
of
the
late
whole
seem
possess
by
the
full
might
of
its
wrath
,
rush
to
be
gather
to
the
composition
of
another
monster
.
<EOS>
undulating
hill
be

,
undulate
valley
(
with
a
solitary
storm

bird
sometimes
skim
through
them
)
be
lift
up
to
hill
;
masse
of
water
shiver
and
shake
the
beach
with
a
booming
sound
;
every
shape
tumultuously
roll
on
,
as
soon
as
make
,
to
change
its
shape
and
place
,
and
beat
another
shape
and
place
away
;
the
ideal
shore
on
the
horizon
,
with
its
tower
and
building
,
rise
and
fall
<EOS>
;
the
cloud
fall
fast
and
thick
;
I
seem
to
see
a
rend
and
upheaving
of
all
nature
.
   
<EOS>
not
find
Ham
among
the
people
whom
this
memorable
wind
---
for
it
be
still
remember
down
there
,
as
the
great
ever
know
to
blow
upon
that
coast
---
have
bring
together
,
I
make
my
way
to
his
house
.
<EOS>
It
be
shut
;
and
as
no
one
answer
to
my
knocking
,
I
go
,
by
back
way
and
by
-
lane
,
to
the
yard
where
he
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
learn
,
there
,
that
he
have
go
to
Lowestoft
,
to
meet
some
sudden
exigency
of
ship
-
repairing
in
which
his
skill
be
require
;
but
that
he
would
be
back
tomorrow
morning
,
in
good
time
.
   
<EOS>
I
go
back
to
the
inn
;
and
when
I
have
wash
and
dress
,
and
try
to
sleep
,
but
in
vain
,
it
be
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
sit
five
minute
by
the
coffee
-
room
fire
,
when
the
waiter
,
come
to
stir
it
,
as
an
excuse
for
talking
,
tell
me
that
two
collier
have
go
down
,
with
all
hand
,
a
few
mile
away
;
and
that
some
other
ship
have
be
see
labour
hard
in
the
Roads
,
and
try
,
in
great
distress
,
to
keep
off
shore
.
 
<EOS>
mercy
on
them
,
and
on
all
poor
sailor
,
say
he
,
if
we
have
another
night
like
the
last
!
   
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
depress
in
spirit
;
very
solitary
;
and
feel
an
uneasiness
in
Ham
's
not
be
there
,
disproportionate
to
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
seriously
affect
,
without
know
how
much
,
by
late
event
;
and
my
long
exposure
to
the
fierce
wind
have
confuse
me
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
that
jumble
in
my
thought
and
recollection
,
that
I
have
lose
the
clear
arrangement
of
time
and
distance
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
if
I
have
go
out
into
the
town
,
I
should
not
have
be
surprise
,
I
think
,
to
encounter
someone
who
I
know
must
be
then
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
so
to
speak
,
there
be
in
these
respect
a
curious
inattention
in
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
yet
it
be
busy
,
too
,
with
all
the
remembrance
the
place
naturally
awaken
;
and
they
be
particularly
distinct
and
vivid
.
   
<EOS>
in
this
state
,
the
waiter
's
dismal
intelligence
about
the
ship
immediately
connect
itself
,
without
any
effort
of
my
volition
,
with
my
uneasiness
about
Ham
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
persuade
that
I
have
an
apprehension
of
his
return
from
Lowestoft
by
sea
,
and
be
lose
.
 
<EOS>
this
grow
so
strong
with
me
,
that
I
resolve
to
go
back
to
the
yard
before
I
take
my
dinner
,
and
ask
the
boat
-
builder
if
he
think
his
attempt
to
return
by
sea
at
all
likely
?
 
<EOS>
if
he
give
me
the
least
reason
to
think
so
,
I
would
go
over
to
Lowestoft
and
prevent
it
by
bring
him
with
me
.
   
<EOS>
I
hastily
order
my
dinner
,
and
go
back
to
the
yard
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
none
too
soon
;
for
the
boat
-
builder
,
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
,
be
lock
the
yard
-
gate
.
 
<EOS>
He
quite
laugh
when
I
ask
him
the
question
,
and
say
there
be
no
fear
;
no
man
in
his
sense
,
or
out
of
them
,
would
put
off
in
such
a
gale
of
wind
,
least
of
all
Ham
Peggotty
,
who
have
be
bear
to
seafare
.
   
<EOS>
so
sensible
of
this
,
beforehand
,
that
I
have
really
feel
ashamed
of
do
what
I
be
nevertheless
impel
to
do
,
I
go
back
to
the
inn
.
 
<EOS>
if
such
a
wind
could
rise
,
I
think
it
be
rise
.
 
<EOS>
the
howl
and
roar
,
the
rattling
of
the
door
and
window
,
the
rumbling
in
the
chimney
,
the
apparent
rocking
of
the
very
house
that
shelter
me
,
and
the
prodigious
tumult
of
the
sea
,
be
more
fearful
than
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
now
a
great
darkness
besides
;
and
that
invest
the
storm
with
new
terror
,
real
and
fanciful
.
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
eat
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
sit
still
,
I
could
not
continue
steadfast
to
anything
.
 
<EOS>
something
within
me
,
faintly
answer
to
the
storm
without
,
toss
up
the
depth
of
my
memory
and
make
a
tumult
in
them
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
in
all
the
hurry
of
my
thought
,
wild
run
with
the
thundering
sea
,
---
<EOS>
the
storm
,
and
my
uneasiness
regard
Ham
be
always
in
the
fore
-
ground
.
   
<EOS>
My
dinner
go
away
almost
untasted
,
and
I
try
to
refresh
myself
with
a
glass
or
two
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
I
fall
into
a
dull
slumber
before
the
fire
,
without
lose
my
consciousness
,
either
of
the
uproar
out
of
door
,
or
of
the
place
in
which
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
both
become
overshadowed
by
a
new
and
indefinable
horror
;
and
when
I
awoke
---
or
rather
when
I
shake
off
the
lethargy
that
bind
me
in
my
chair
---
my
whole
frame
thrill
with
objectless
and
unintelligible
fear
.
   
<EOS>
I
walk
to
and
fro
,
try
to
read
an
old
gazetteer
,
listen
to
the
awful
noise
:
<EOS>
look
at
face
,
scene
,
and
figure
in
the
fire
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
the
steady
ticking
of
the
undisturbed
clock
on
the
wall
torment
me
to
that
degree
that
I
resolve
to
go
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
reassure
,
on
such
a
night
,
to
be
tell
that
some
of
the
inn
-
servant
have
agree
together
to
sit
up
until
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
bed
,
exceedingly
weary
and
heavy
;
but
,
on
my
lie
down
,
all
such
sensation
vanish
,
as
if
by
magic
,
and
I
be
broad
awake
,
with
every
sense
refine
.
   
<EOS>
for
hour
I
lie
there
,
listen
to
the
wind
and
water
;
imagining
,
now
,
that
I
hear
shriek
out
at
sea
;
now
,
that
I
distinctly
hear
the
firing
of
signal
gun
;
and
now
,
the
fall
of
house
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
I
get
up
,
several
time
,
and
look
out
;
but
could
see
nothing
,
except
the
reflection
in
the
window
-
pane
of
the
faint
candle
I
have
leave
burn
,
and
of
my
own
haggard
face
look
in
at
me
from
the
black
void
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
,
my
restlessness
attain
to
such
a
pitch
,
that
I
hurry
on
my
clothe
,
and
go
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
large
kitchen
,
where
I
dimly
see
bacon
and
rope
of
onion
hang
from
the
beam
,
the
watcher
be
cluster
together
,
in
various
attitude
,
about
a
table
,
purposely
move
away
from
the
great
chimney
,
and
bring
near
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
a
pretty
girl
,
who
have
her
ear
stop
with
her
apron
,
and
her
eye
upon
the
door
,
scream
when
I
appear
,
suppose
me
to
be
a
spirit
;
but
the
other
have
more
presence
of
mind
,
and
be
glad
of
an
addition
to
their
company
.
 
<EOS>
one
man
,
refer
to
the
topic
they
have
be
discuss
,
ask
me
whether
I
think
the
soul
of
the
collier
-
crew
who
have
go
down
,
be
out
in
the
storm
?
   
<EOS>
I
remain
there
,
I
dare
say
,
two
hour
.
 
<EOS>
once
,
I
open
the
yard
-
gate
,
and
look
into
the
empty
street
.
 
<EOS>
the
sand
,
the
sea
-
weed
,
and
the
flake
of
foam
,
be
drive
by
;
and
I
be
oblige
to
call
for
assistance
before
I
could
shut
the
gate
again
,
and
make
it
fast
against
the
wind
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
dark
gloom
in
my
solitary
chamber
,
when
I
at
length
return
to
it
;
but
I
be
tired
now
,
and
,
get
into
bed
again
,
fall
---
off
a
tower
and
down
a
precipice
---
into
the
depth
of
sleep
.
<EOS>
I
have
an
impression
that
for
a
long
time
,
though
I
dream
of
be
elsewhere
and
in
a
variety
of
scene
,
it
be
always
blow
in
my
dream
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
I
lose
that
feeble
hold
upon
reality
,
and
be
engage
with
two
dear
friend
,
but
who
they
be
I
do
not
know
,
at
the
siege
of
some
town
in
a
roar
of
cannonading
.
   
<EOS>
the
thunder
of
the
cannon
be
so
loud
and
incessant
,
that
I
could
not
hear
something
I
much
desire
to
hear
,
until
I
make
a
great
exertion
and
awoke
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
broad
day
---
eight
or
nine
o'clock
;
<EOS>
the
storm
rage
,
in
lieu
of
the
battery
;
and
someone
knock
and
call
at
my
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
I
cry
.
   
<EOS>
"
a
wreck
!
<EOS>
close
by
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
spring
out
of
bed
,
and
ask
,
what
wreck
?
   
<EOS>
"
a
schooner
,
from
Spain
or
Portugal
,
laden
with
fruit
and
wine
.
<EOS>
make
haste
,
sir
,
if
you
want
to
see
her
!
<EOS>
It
be
think
,
down
on
the
beach
,
she
will
go
to
piece
every
moment
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
excited
voice
go
clamour
along
the
staircase
;
and
I
wrap
myself
in
my
clothe
as
quickly
as
I
could
,
and
run
into
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
number
of
people
be
there
before
me
,
all
run
in
one
direction
,
to
the
beach
.
 
<EOS>
I
run
the
same
way
,
outstrip
a
good
many
,
and
soon
come
face
the
wild
sea
.
   
<EOS>
the
wind
may
by
this
time
have
lull
a
little
,
though
not
more
sensibly
than
if
the
cannonading
I
have
dream
of
,
have
be
diminish
by
the
silencing
of
half
-
a
-
dozen
gun
out
of
hundred
.
<EOS>
but
the
sea
,
have
upon
it
the
additional
agitation
of
the
whole
night
,
be
infinitely
more
terrific
than
when
I
have
see
it
last
.
<EOS>
every
appearance
it
have
then
present
,
bore
the
expression
of
be
swell
;
and
the
height
to
which
the
breaker
rise
,
and
,
look
over
one
another
,
bear
one
another
down
,
and
roll
in
,
in
interminable
host
,
be
most
appalling
.
<EOS>
in
the
difficulty
of
hear
anything
but
wind
and
wave
,
and
in
the
crowd
,
and
the
unspeakable
confusion
,
and
my
first
breathless
effort
to
stand
against
the
weather
,
I
be
so
confused
that
I
look
out
to
sea
for
the
wreck
,
and
see
nothing
but
the
foam
head
of
the
great
wave
.
 
<EOS>
a
half
-
dress
boatman
,
stand
next
me
,
point
with
his
bare
arm
(
a
tattoo'd
arrow
on
it
,
point
in
the
same
direction
)
to
the
left
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
o
great
Heaven
,
I
see
it
,
close
in
upon
us
!
   
<EOS>
one
mast
be
break
short
off
,
six
or
eight
foot
from
the
deck
,
and
lie
over
the
side
,
entangle
in
a
maze
of
sail
and
rigging
;
and
all
that
ruin
,
as
the
ship
roll
and
beat
---
which
she
do
without
a
moment
's
pause
,
and
with
a
violence
quite
inconceivable
---
beat
the
side
as
if
it
would
stave
it
in
.
 
<EOS>
some
effort
be
even
then
be
make
,
to
cut
this
portion
of
the
wreck
away
;
for
,
as
the
ship
,
which
be
broadside
on
,
turn
towards
us
in
her
rolling
<EOS>
,
I
plainly
descry
her
people
at
work
with
axis
,
especially
one
active
figure
with
long
curl
hair
,
conspicuous
among
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
but
a
great
cry
,
which
be
audible
even
above
the
wind
and
water
,
rise
from
the
shore
at
this
moment
;
the
sea
,
sweep
over
the
rolling
wreck
,
make
a
clean
breach
,
and
carry
man
,
spar
,
cask
,
plank
,
bulwark
,
heap
of
such
toy
,
into
the
boiling
surge
.
   
<EOS>
the
second
mast
be
yet
stand
,
with
the
rag
of
a
rent
sail
,
and
a
wild
confusion
of
broken
cordage
flap
to
and
fro
.
 
<EOS>
the
ship
have
strike
once
,
the
same
boatman
hoarsely
say
in
my
ear
,
and
then
lift
in
and
strike
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
understand
him
to
add
that
she
be
part
amidship
,
and
I
could
readily
suppose
so
,
for
the
rolling
and
beating
be
too
tremendous
for
any
human
work
to
suffer
long
.
<EOS>
as
he
speak
,
there
be
another
great
cry
of
pity
from
the
beach
;
four
man
arise
with
the
wreck
out
of
the
deep
,
cling
to
the
rigging
of
the
remain
mast
;
uppermost
,
the
active
figure
with
the
curl
hair
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
bell
on
board
;
and
as
the
ship
roll
and
dash
,
like
a
desperate
creature
drive
mad
,
now
show
us
the
whole
sweep
of
her
deck
,
as
she
turn
on
her
beam
-
end
towards
the
shore
,
now
nothing
but
her
keel
,
as
she
spring
wildly
over
and
turn
towards
the
sea
,
the
bell
rang
;
and
its
sound
,
the
knell
of
those
unhappy
man
,
be
bear
towards
us
on
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
again
we
lose
her
,
and
again
she
rise
.
 
<EOS>
two
man
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
the
agony
on
the
shore
increase
.
 
<EOS>
man
groan
,
and
clasp
their
hand
;
woman
shriek
,
and
turn
away
their
face
.
 
<EOS>
some
run
wildly
up
and
down
along
the
beach
,
cry
for
help
where
no
help
could
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
myself
one
of
these
,
frantically
implore
a
knot
of
sailor
whom
I
know
,
not
to
let
those
two
lost
creature
perish
before
our
eye
.
   
<EOS>
They
be
make
out
to
me
,
in
an
agitated
way
---
I
do
not
know
how
,
for
the
little
I
could
hear
I
be
scarcely
compose
enough
to
understand
---
that
the
lifeboat
have
be
bravely
man
an
hour
ago
,
and
could
do
nothing
;
and
that
as
no
man
would
be
so
desperate
as
to
attempt
to
wade
off
with
a
rope
,
and
establish
a
communication
with
the
shore
<EOS>
,
there
be
nothing
leave
to
try
;
when
I
notice
that
some
new
sensation
move
the
people
on
the
beach
,
and
see
them
part
,
and
Ham
come
break
through
them
to
the
front
.
   
<EOS>
I
run
to
him
---
as
well
as
I
know
,
to
repeat
my
appeal
for
help
.
<EOS>
but
,
distract
though
I
be
,
by
a
sight
so
new
to
me
and
terrible
,
the
determination
in
his
face
,
and
his
look
out
to
sea
---
exactly
the
same
look
as
I
remember
in
connexion
with
the
morning
after
Emily
's
flight
---
awoke
me
to
a
knowledge
of
his
danger
.
 
<EOS>
I
hold
him
back
with
both
arm
;
and
implore
the
man
with
whom
I
have
be
speak
,
not
to
listen
to
him
,
not
to
do
murder
,
not
to
let
him
stir
from
off
that
sand
!
   
<EOS>
another
cry
arise
on
shore
;
and
look
to
the
wreck
,
we
see
the
cruel
sail
,
with
blow
on
blow
,
beat
off
the
low
of
the
two
man
,
and
fly
up
in
triumph
round
the
active
figure
leave
alone
upon
the
mast
.
   
<EOS>
against
such
a
sight
,
and
against
such
determination
as
that
of
the
calmly
desperate
man
who
be
already
accustom
to
lead
half
the
people
present
,
I
may
as
hopefully
have
entreat
the
wind
.
"
<EOS>
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
he
say
,
cheerily
grasp
me
by
both
hand
,
"
if
my
time
be
come
,
'
tis
come
.
 
<EOS>
if
'
tan't
,
I
will
bide
it
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
above
bless
you
,
and
bless
all
!
<EOS>
mate
,
make
me
ready
!
<EOS>
I
be
a
-
go
off
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
sweep
away
,
but
not
unkindly
,
to
some
distance
,
where
the
people
around
me
make
me
stay
;
urge
,
as
I
confusedly
perceive
,
that
he
be
bent
on
go
,
with
help
or
without
,
and
that
I
should
endanger
the
precaution
for
his
safety
by
trouble
those
with
whom
they
rest
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
I
answer
,
or
what
they
rejoin
;
but
I
see
hurry
on
the
beach
,
and
man
run
with
rope
from
a
capstan
that
be
there
,
and
penetrate
into
a
circle
of
figure
that
hide
him
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
I
see
him
stand
alone
,
in
a
seaman
's
frock
and
trouser
:
a
rope
in
his
hand
,
or
sling
to
his
wrist
:
<EOS>
another
round
his
body
:
and
several
of
the
good
man
hold
,
at
a
little
distance
,
to
the
latter
,
which
he
lay
out
himself
,
slack
upon
the
shore
,
at
his
foot
.
   
<EOS>
the
wreck
,
even
to
my
unpractised
eye
,
be
break
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
that
she
be
part
in
the
middle
,
and
that
the
life
of
the
solitary
man
upon
the
mast
hang
by
a
thread
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
he
cling
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
singular
red
cap
on
,
---
not
like
a
sailor
's
cap
,
but
of
a
fine
colour
;
and
as
the
few
yield
plank
between
him
and
destruction
roll
and
bulge
,
and
his
anticipative
death
-
knell
rung
,
he
be
see
by
all
of
us
to
wave
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
do
it
now
,
and
think
I
be
go
distract
,
when
his
action
bring
an
old
remembrance
to
my
mind
of
a
once
dear
friend
.
   
<EOS>
Ham
watch
the
sea
,
stand
alone
,
with
the
silence
of
suspend
breath
behind
him
,
and
the
storm
before
,
until
there
be
a
great
retiring
wave
,
when
,
with
a
backward
glance
at
those
who
hold
the
rope
which
be
make
fast
round
his
body
,
he
dash
in
after
it
,
and
in
a
moment
be
buffet
with
the
water
;
rise
with
the
hill
,
fall
with
the
valley
,
lose
beneath
the
foam
;
then
draw
again
to
land
.
 
<EOS>
They
haul
in
hastily
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
blood
on
his
face
,
from
where
I
stand
;
but
he
take
no
thought
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
hurriedly
to
give
them
some
direction
for
leave
him
more
free
---
or
<EOS>
so
I
judge
from
the
motion
of
his
arm
---
and
be
go
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
and
now
he
make
for
the
wreck
,
rise
with
the
hill
,
fall
with
the
valley
,
lose
beneath
the
rugged
foam
,
bear
in
towards
the
shore
,
bear
on
towards
the
ship
,
strive
hard
and
valiantly
.
 
<EOS>
the
distance
be
nothing
,
but
the
power
of
the
sea
and
wind
make
the
strife
deadly
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
he
near
the
wreck
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
so
near
,
that
with
one
more
of
his
vigorous
stroke
he
would
be
cling
to
it
,
---
<EOS>
when
a
high
,
green
,
vast
hill
-
side
of
water
,
move
on
shoreward
,
from
beyond
the
ship
,
he
seem
to
leap
up
into
it
with
a
mighty
bind
,
and
the
ship
be
go
!
   
<EOS>
some
eddy
fragment
I
see
in
the
sea
,
as
if
a
mere
cask
have
be
break
,
in
run
to
the
spot
where
they
be
haul
in
.
<EOS>
consternation
be
in
every
face
.
 
<EOS>
They
draw
him
to
my
very
foot
---
insensible
---
dead
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
carry
to
the
near
house
;
and
,
no
one
prevent
me
now
,
I
remain
near
him
,
busy
,
while
every
means
of
restoration
be
try
;
but
he
have
be
beat
to
death
by
the
great
wave
,
and
his
generous
heart
be
still
for
ever
.
   
<EOS>
as
I
sit
beside
the
bed
,
when
hope
be
abandon
and
all
be
do
,
a
fisherman
,
who
have
know
me
when
Emily
and
I
be
child
,
and
ever
since
,
whisper
my
name
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
with
tear
start
to
his
weather
-
beat
face
,
which
,
with
his
tremble
lip
,
be
ashy
pale
,
"
will
you
come
over
yonder
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
old
remembrance
that
have
be
recall
to
me
,
be
in
his
look
.
<EOS>
I
ask
him
,
terror
-
stricken
,
lean
on
the
arm
he
hold
out
to
support
me
:
   
"
<EOS>
have
a
body
come
ashore
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
I
know
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
then
.
   
<EOS>
He
answer
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
but
he
lead
me
to
the
shore
.
 
<EOS>
and
on
that
part
of
it
where
she
and
I
have
look
for
shell
,
two
child
---
on
that
part
of
it
where
some
light
fragment
of
the
old
boat
,
blow
down
last
night
,
have
be
scatter
by
the
wind
---
among
the
ruin
of
the
home
he
have
wrong
<EOS>
---
I
see
him
lie
with
his
head
upon
his
arm
,
as
I
have
often
see
him
lie
at
school
.

Chapter

<EOS>
the
new
wound
,
and
the
old
 
<EOS>
no
need
,
o
Steerforth
,
to
have
say
,
when
we
last
speak
together
,
in
that
hour
which
I
so
little
deem
to
be
our
parting
-
hour
---
<EOS>
no
need
to
have
say
,
"
think
of
me
at
my
good
!
<EOS>
"
I
have
do
that
ever
;
and
could
I
change
now
,
look
on
this
sight
!
   
<EOS>
They
bring
a
hand
-
bi
,
and
lay
him
on
it
,
and
cover
him
with
a
flag
,
and
take
him
up
and
bore
him
on
towards
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
man
who
carry
him
have
know
him
,
and
go
sail
with
him
,
and
see
him
merry
and
bold
.
 
<EOS>
They
carry
him
through
the
wild
roar
,
a
hush
in
the
midst
of
all
the
tumult
;
and
take
him
to
the
cottage
where
death
be
already
.
   
<EOS>
but
when
they
set
the
bi
down
on
the
threshold
,
they
look
at
one
another
,
and
at
me
,
and
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
why
.
 
<EOS>
They
feel
as
if
it
be
not
right
to
lay
him
down
in
the
same
quiet
room
.
   
<EOS>
We
go
into
the
town
,
and
take
our
burden
to
the
inn
.
 
<EOS>
so
soon
as
I
could
at
all
collect
my
thought
,
I
send
for
Joram
,
and
beg
him
to
provide
me
a
conveyance
in
which
it
could
be
get
to
London
in
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
the
care
of
it
,
and
the
hard
duty
of
prepare
his
mother
to
receive
it
,
could
only
rest
with
me
;
and
I
be
anxious
to
discharge
that
duty
as
faithfully
as
I
could
.
   
<EOS>
I
choose
the
night
for
the
journey
,
that
there
may
be
less
curiosity
when
I
leave
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
although
it
be
nearly
midnight
when
I
come
out
of
the
yard
in
a
chaise
,
follow
by
what
I
have
in
charge
,
there
be
many
people
wait
.
 
<EOS>
at
interval
,
along
the
town
,
and
even
a
little
way
out
upon
the
road
,
I
see
more
:
but
at
length
only
the
bleak
night
and
the
open
country
be
around
me
,
and
the
ashe
of
my
youthful
friendship
.
   
<EOS>
upon
a
mellow
autumn
day
,
about
noon
,
when
the
ground
be
perfume
by
fall
leave
,
and
many
more
,
in
beautiful
tint
of
yellow
,
red
,
and
brown
,
yet
hang
upon
the
tree
,
through
which
the
sun
be
shine
,
I
arrive
at
Highgate
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk
the
last
mile
,
think
as
I
go
along
of
what
I
have
to
do
;
and
leave
the
carriage
that
have
follow
me
all
through
the
night
,
await
order
to
advance
.
   
<EOS>
the
house
,
when
I
come
up
to
it
,
look
just
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
not
a
blind
be
raise
;
no
sign
of
life
be
in
the
dull
paved
court
,
with
its
covered
way
lead
to
the
disused
door
.
 
<EOS>
the
wind
have
quite
go
down
,
and
nothing
move
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
not
,
at
first
,
the
courage
to
ring
at
the
gate
;
and
<EOS>
when
I
do
ring
,
my
errand
seem
to
me
to
be
express
in
the
very
sound
of
the
bell
.
 
<EOS>
the
little
parlour
-
maid
come
out
,
with
the
key
in
her
hand
;
and
look
earnestly
at
me
as
she
unlock
the
gate
,
say
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
be
you
ill
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
much
agitate
,
and
be
fatigue
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
be
anything
the
matter
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
---
Mr
James
?
 
<EOS>
---
"
   
"
Hush
!
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
something
have
happen
,
that
I
have
to
break
to
Mrs
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
at
home
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
girl
anxiously
reply
that
her
mistress
be
very
seldom
out
now
,
even
in
a
carriage
;
that
she
keep
her
room
;
that
she
see
no
company
,
but
would
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
Her
mistress
be
up
,
she
say
,
and
Miss
Dartle
be
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
what
message
should
she
take
upstairs
?
   
<EOS>
give
her
a
strict
charge
to
be
careful
of
her
manner
,
and
only
to
carry
in
my
card
and
say
I
wait
,
I
sit
down
in
the
drawing
-
room
(
which
we
have
now
reach
)
until
she
should
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
Its
former
pleasant
air
of
occupation
be
go
,
and
the
shutter
be
half
closed
.
 
<EOS>
the
harp
have
not
be
use
for
many
and
many
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
His
picture
,
as
a
boy
,
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
the
cabinet
in
which
his
mother
have
keep
his
letter
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
she
ever
read
them
now
;
if
she
would
ever
read
them
more
!
   
<EOS>
the
house
be
so
still
that
I
hear
the
girl
's
light
step
upstairs
.
<EOS>
on
her
return
,
she
bring
a
message
,
to
the
effect
that
Mrs
Steerforth
be
an
invalid
and
could
not
come
down
;
but
that
if
I
would
excuse
her
be
in
her
chamber
,
she
would
be
glad
to
see
me
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
moment
I
stand
before
her
.
   
<EOS>
She
be
in
his
room
;
not
in
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
,
of
course
,
that
she
have
take
to
occupy
it
,
in
remembrance
of
him
;
and
that
the
many
token
of
his
old
sport
and
accomplishment
,
by
which
she
be
surround
,
remain
there
,
just
as
he
have
leave
them
,
for
the
same
reason
.
 
<EOS>
She
murmur
<EOS>
,
however
,
even
in
her
reception
of
me
,
that
she
be
out
of
her
own
chamber
because
its
aspect
be
unsuite
to
her
infirmity
;
and
with
her
stately
look
repel
the
least
suspicion
of
the
truth
.
   
<EOS>
at
her
chair
,
as
usual
,
be
Rosa
Dartle
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
first
moment
of
her
dark
eye
rest
on
me
,
I
see
she
know
I
be
the
bearer
of
evil
tiding
.
 
<EOS>
the
scar
spring
into
view
that
instant
.
 
<EOS>
She
withdraw
herself
a
step
behind
the
chair
,
to
keep
her
own
face
out
of
Mrs
Steerforth
's
observation
;
and
scrutinize
me
with
a
piercing
gaze
that
never
falter
,
never
shrink
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
to
observe
you
<EOS>
be
in
mourning
,
sir
,
"
say
Mrs
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
unhappily
a
widower
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
young
to
know
so
great
a
loss
,
"
she
return
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
grieve
to
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
grieve
to
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Time
will
be
good
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
Time
,
"
say
I
,
look
at
her
,
"
will
be
good
to
all
of
us
.
<EOS>
dear
Mrs
Steerforth
,
we
must
all
trust
to
that
,
in
our
heavy
misfortune
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
earnestness
of
my
manner
,
and
the
tear
in
my
eye
,
alarm
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
course
of
her
thought
appear
to
stop
,
and
change
.
   
<EOS>
I
try
to
command
my
voice
in
gently
say
his
name
,
but
it
tremble
.
 
<EOS>
She
repeat
it
to
herself
,
two
or
three
time
,
in
a
low
tone
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
address
me
,
she
say
,
with
enforced
calmness
:
   
<EOS>
"
My
son
be
ill
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
very
ill
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
see
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
be
you
reconcile
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
say
<EOS>
yes
,
I
could
not
say
no
.
 
<EOS>
She
slightly
turn
her
head
towards
the
spot
where
Rosa
Dartle
have
be
stand
at
her
elbow
,
and
in
that
moment
I
say
,
by
the
motion
of
my
lip
,
to
Rosa
,
"
dead
!
"
   
<EOS>
that
Mrs
Steerforth
may
not
be
induce
to
look
behind
her
,
and
read
,
plainly
write
,
what
she
be
not
yet
prepared
to
know
,
I
meet
her
look
quickly
;
but
I
have
see
Rosa
Dartle
throw
her
hand
up
in
the
air
with
vehemence
of
despair
and
horror
,
and
then
clasp
them
on
her
face
.
   
<EOS>
the
handsome
lady
---
<EOS>
so
like
,
<EOS>
oh
so
like
!
---
regard
me
with
a
fix
look
,
and
put
her
hand
to
her
forehead
.
 
<EOS>
I
beseech
her
to
be
calm
,
and
prepare
herself
to
bear
what
I
have
to
tell
;
but
I
should
rather
have
entreat
her
to
weep
,
for
she
sit
like
a
stone
figure
.
   
<EOS>
"
when
I
be
last
here
,
"
I
falter
,
"
Miss
Dartle
tell
me
he
be
sail
here
and
there

<EOS>
the
night
before
last
be
a
dreadful
one
at
sea

<EOS>
if
he
be
at
sea
that
night
,
and
near
a
dangerous
coast
,
as
it
be

he

and
if
the
vessel

"
come

<EOS>
She
come
,
but
with
no
sympathy
or
gentleness
.
 
<EOS>
Her
eye
gleam
like
fire
as
she
confront
his
mother
,
and
break
into
a
frightful
laugh
.
   
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
Mrs

fall
back
stiffly
in

chair

and
make
no
sound

a
moan

cast
her
eye
upon

wide
stare

<EOS>
the
emigrant
 
one
thing
more
<EOS>
,
I
have
to
do
,
before
yield
myself
to
the
shock
of
these
emotion

<EOS>
It
be
,
to
conceal
what
have
occur
,
from
those
who
be
go
away
;
and
to
dismiss
them
on
their
voyage
in
happy
ignorance

<EOS>
in
this
,
no
time
be
to
be
lose
.
   
<EOS>
I
take
Mr
Micawber
aside
that

night
,
and
confide
to
him
the
task
of
stand
between
Mr
Peggotty
and
intelligence
of
the
late
catastrophe
.
 
<EOS>
He
zealously
undertake
to
do
so
,
and
to
intercept
any
newspaper
through
which
it
may
,
without
such
precaution
,
reach
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
if

himself
on

it

through
this
body

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
,
I
must
observe
,
in
his
adaptation
of
himself
to
a
new
state
of
society
,
have
acquire
a
bold
buccaneering
air
,
not
absolutely
lawless
,
but
defensive
and
prompt
.
 
<EOS>
one
may
have
suppose
him
a
child
of
the
wilderness
,
long
accustomed
to
live
out
of
the
confine
of
civilization
,
and
about
to
return
to
his
native
wild
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
provide
himself
,
among
other
thing
,
with
a
complete
suit
of
oilskin
,
and
a
straw
hat
with
a
very
low
crown
,
pitch
or
caulk
on
the
outside
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
rough
clothing
,
with
a
common
mariner
's
telescope
under
his
arm
,
and
a
shrewd
trick
of
cast
up
his
eye
at
the
sky
as
look
out
for
dirty
weather
,
he
be
far
more
nautical
,
after
his
manner
,
than
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
His
whole
family
,
if
I
may
so
express
it
,
be
clear
for
action
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
Mrs
Micawber
in
the
close
and
most
uncompromising
of
bonnet
,
make
fast
under
the
chin
;
and
in
a
shawl
which
tie
her
up
(
as
I
have
be
tie
up
,
when
my
aunt
first
receive
me
)
like
a

and
be
secure
behind
at
the

in
a
strong

<EOS>
Miss

make

Master

<EOS>
both
Mr

I

greatly
shock
him

there
could
be
no

of
the
kindness
of
keep
it

It

<EOS>
It
be
not
easy
to

still

when
Mr

bring
him
in

that
I

descend
to
the
bar

be
quite
at
home
;

in
due
time
return
with
a
steam
jug

I
could
not

observe
that
he
have
be
peel
the
lemon

knife

,
as
become
the
knife

be
about

wipe

not

Mrs

now
find
to

formidable

Mr

Mrs

he
may

there
be

full
in

serve
it
out

them
in

villainous
little

I
never

him

anything
so
much

out
of

particular
pint
pot

put
it

close

evening

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
withdraw
,
and
be
absent
some
little
time
;
in
the
course
of
which
Mrs
Micawber
be
not
wholly
free
from
an
apprehension
that
word
may
have
arise
between
him
and
the
Member
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
the
same
boy
reappear
,
and
present
me
with
a
note
write
in
pencil
,
and
head
,
in
a
legal
manner
,
"
heep
v
Micawber
"
.
 
<EOS>
from
this
document
,
I
learn
that
Mr
Micawber
be
again
arrest
,
be
in
a
final
paroxysm
of
despair
;
and
that
he
beg
me
to
send
him
his
knife
and
pint
pot
,
by
bearer
,
as
they
may
prove
serviceable
during
the
brief
remainder
of
his
existence
,
in
jail
.
 
<EOS>
He
also
request
,
as
a
last
act
of
friendship
,
that
I
would
see
his
family
to
the
Parish
Workhouse
,
and
forget
that
such
a
being
ever
live
.
   
<EOS>
of
course
I
answer
this
note
by
go
down
with
the
boy
to
pay
the
money
,
where
I
find
Mr
Micawber
sit
in
a
corner
,
look
darkly
at
the
Sheriff
's
Officer
who
have
effect
the
capture
.
 
<EOS>
on
his
release
,
he
embrace
me
with
the
utmost
fervour
;
and
make
an
entry
of
the
transaction
in
his
pocket
-
book
---
be
very
particular
,
I
recollect
,
about
a
halfpenny
I
inadvertently
omit
from
my
statement
of
the
total
.
   
<EOS>
this
momentous
pocket
-
book
be
a
timely
reminder
to
him
of
another
transaction
.
 
<EOS>
on
our
return
to
the
room
upstairs
(
where
he
account
for
his
absence
by
say
that
it
have
be
occasion
by
circumstance
over
which
he
have
no
control
)
,
he
take
out
of
it
a
large
sheet
of
paper
,
fold
small
,
and
quite
cover
with
long
sum
,
carefully
work
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
glimpse
I
have
of
them
,
I
should
say
that
I
never
see
such
sum
out
of
a
school
cipher
-
book
.
<EOS>
these
,
it
seem
,
be
calculation
of
compound
interest
on
what
he
call
"
the
principal
amount
of
forty
-
one
,
ten
,
eleven
and
a
half
"
,
for
various
period
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
careful
consideration
of
these
,
and
an
elaborate
estimate
of
his
resource
,
he
have
come
to
the
conclusion
to
select
that
sum
which
represent
the
amount
with
compound
interest
to
two
year
,
fifteen
calendar
month
,
and
fourteen
day
,
from
that
date
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
he
have
draw
a
note
-
of
-
hand
with
great
neatness
,
which
he
hand
over
to
Traddles
on
the
spot
,
a
discharge
of
his
debt
in
full
(
as
between
man
and
man
)
,
with
many
acknowledgement
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
still
a
presentiment
,
"
say
Mrs
Micawber
,
pensively
shake
her
head
,
"
that
my
family
will
appear
on
board
,
before
we
finally
depart
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
evidently
have
his
presentiment
on
the
subject
too
,
but
he
put
it
in
his
tin
pot
and
swallow
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
you
have
any
opportunity
of
send
letter
home
,
on
your
passage
,
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
say
my
aunt
,
"
you
must
let
us
hear
from
you

<EOS>
"
My
dear
Miss
Trotwood

"
she
reply
,
"
I
shall
only
be
too
happy
to
think
that
anyone
expect

hear

<EOS>
I
shall
not
fail
to
correspond
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
,
I
trust
,
as
an
old
and
familiar
friend
,
will
not
object
to
receive
occasional
intelligence
,
himself
,
from
one
who
know
him
when
the
twin
be
yet
unconscious
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
say
that
I
should
hope
to
hear
,
whenever
she
have
an
opportunity
of
writing
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Please
Heaven
,
there
will
be
many
such
opportunity
,
"
say
Mr
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
ocean
,
in
these
time
,
be
a
perfect
fleet
of
ship
;
and
we
can
hardly
fail
to
encounter
many
,
in
run
over
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
merely
cross

"
say
Mr
Micawber
,
trifle
with
his
eye
-
glass
,
"
merely
cross
.
 
<EOS>
the
distance
be
quite
imaginary
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
think
,
now
,
how
odd
it
be
,
<EOS>
but
how
wonderfully
like
Mr
Micawber
<EOS>
,
that
,
when
he
go
from
London
to
Canterbury
,
he
should
have
talk
as
if
he
be
go
to
the
farth
limit
of
the
earth
;
and
,
when
he
go
from
England
to
Australia
,
as
if
he
be
go
for
a
little
trip
across
the
channel
.
   
<EOS>
"
on
the
voyage
,
I
shall
endeavour
,
"
say
Mr
Micawber
,
"
occasionally
to
spin
them
a
yarn
;
and
the
melody
of
my
son
Wilkins
will
,
I
trust
,
be
acceptable
at
the
galley
-
fire
.
 
<EOS>
when
Mrs
Micawber
have
her
sea

leg
on

an
expression
in
which
I
hope
there
be
no
conventional
impropriety

will
be
frequently

athwart
our

,
either
on

quarter

object
of

<EOS>
in
short
,
"
say
Mr
Micawber
,
with
the
old
genteel
air
,
"
the
probability
be
,
all
will
be

so
exciting

with
that

flourish
off
the
content
of
his
little
tin
pot

if
he
have
make
the
voyage

have
pass

I

from
the

moment
of
this
voyage

I
wish
Mr
Micawber
to
stand
upon
that
vessel

prow

say
,
"
enough
of
delay

enough
of
disappointment

"
and
do
that

feel
his
position

be
I
not
right
in
say
that
Mr
Micawber
will
strengthen
,

not
weaken
,
his
connexion

Britain

an

I

Can
I

so
weak

wield
the
rod

talent

of
power

will
be

I

I

<EOS>
Mrs

conviction
that
her
argument
be
unanswerable

give
a
moral
elevation

her

I

never

Mr

will
be

Mr

put
down
the

one
on

knee
,
to
join
Mr

Mrs
Micawber
in
drink
to
all

in
return

and
when
he
and
the
Micawbers
cordially
shake
hand
as
comrade
,
and
his
brown
face
brighten
with
a
smile
,
I
feel
that
he
would
make
his
way
,
establish
a
good
name
,
and
be
beloved
,
go
where
he
would
.
   
<EOS>
even
the
child
be
instruct

dip
a

when

It
be
a
sorrowful
farewell
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
all
cry
;
the
child
hang
about
agne
to
the
last
;
and
we
leave
poor
Mrs
Micawber
in
a
very
distressed
condition
,
sobbing
and
weeping
by
a
dim
candle
,
that
must
have
make
the
room
look
,
from
the
river
,
like
a
miserable
light
-
house
.
   
<EOS>
I
go
down
again
next
morning
to
see
that
they
be
away
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
depart
,
in
a
boat
,
as
early
as
five
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
wonderful
instance
to
me
of
the
gap
such
parting
make
,
<EOS>
that
although
my
association
of
them
with
the
tumble
-
down
public

house
and
the
wooden
stair
date
only
from
last
night
,
both
seem
dreary
and
desert
,
now
that
they
be
go

<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
,
my
old
nurse
and
I
go
down
to
Gravesend
.
 
<EOS>
We
find
the
ship
in
the
river
,
surround
by
a
crowd
of
boat
;
a
favourable
wind
blow
;
the
signal
for
sailing
at
her
mast
-
head
.
 
<EOS>
I
hire
a
boat
directly
,
and
we
put
off
to
her
;
and
get
through
the
little
vortex
of
confusion
of
which
she
be
the
centre
,
go
on
board
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
be
wait
for
us
on
deck

He
tell
me
that
Mr

just
now
be
arrest
again
(
and
for
the
last
time

at
the
suit
of
Heep

and
that
,
in
compliance
with
a
request
I
have
make
to
him
,
he
have
pay
the
money
,
which
I
repay
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
take
us
down
between

and
there
,
<EOS>
any
linger
fear
I
have
of
his

hear
any

what
have
happen
,
be
dispel

Mr

his

protection

tell
me
that

scarcely

since
the
night

It
be
such
a
strange
scene
to
me

and
so
confined
and
dark
,
that
,
at
first
,
I
could
make
out
hardly
anything
;
but
,
by
degree
,
it
clear
,
as
my
eye
become
more
accustomed
to
the
gloom

and
I
seem
to
stand
in
a
picture
by

as

I

I
see
sit

by

with
one

a
figure
like

glide
calmly

in

absence
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
and
gloomy
night
that
gather
on
me
,
haunt
by
the
ghost
of
many
hope
,
of
many
dear
remembrance
,
many
error
,
many
unavaile
sorrow
and
regret
.
   
<EOS>
I
go
away
from
England
;
not
know
,
even
then
,
how
great
the
shock
be
,
that
I
have
to
bear
.
 
<EOS>
I
leave
all
who
be
dear

,
and
go
away
;
and
believe
that
I
have
bear
it
,
and
it
be
past
.
 
<EOS>
as
a
man
upon
a
field
of
battle
will
receive
a
mortal
hurt
,
and
scarcely
know
that
he
be
strike
,
so
I
,
when
I
be
leave
alone
with
my
undisciplined
heart
,
have
no
conception
of
the
wound
with
which
it
have
to
strive
.
   
<EOS>
the
knowledge
come
upon
me
,
not
quickly
,
but
little
by
little
,
and
grain
by
grain
.
 
<EOS>
the
desolate
feeling
with
which
I
go
abroad
,
deepened
and
widen
hourly
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
it
be
a
heavy
sense
of
loss
and
sorrow
,
wherein
I
could
distinguish
little
else
.
 
<EOS>
by
imperceptible
degree
,
it
become
a
hopeless
consciousness
of
all
that
I
have
lose
---
love
,
friendship
,
interest
;
of
all
that
have
be
shatter
---
my
first
trust
,
my
first
affection
,
the
whole
airy
castle
of
my
life
;
of
all
that
remain
---
a
ruin
blank
and
waste
,
lie
wide
around
me
,
unbroken
,
to
the
dark
horizon
.
   
<EOS>
if
my
grief
be
selfish
,
I
do
not
know
it
to
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
mourn
for
my
child
-
wife
,
take
from
her
bloom
world
,
so
young
.
 
<EOS>
I
mourn
for
him
who
may
have
win
the
love
and
admiration
of
thousand
,
as
he
have
win
mine
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
I
mourn
for
the
broken
heart
that
have
find
rest
in
the
stormy
sea
;
and
for
the
wander
remnant
of
the
simple
home
,
where
I
have
hear
the
night
-
wind
blowing
,
when
I
be
a
child
.
   
<EOS>
from
the
accumulate
sadness
into
which
I
fall
,
I
have
at
length
no
hope
of
ever
issue
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
roam
from
place
to
place
,
carry
my
burden
with
me
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
its
whole
weight
now
;
and
I
droop
beneath
it
,
and
I
say
in
my
heart
that
it
could
never
be
lighten
.
   
<EOS>
when
this
despondency
be
at
its
bad
,
I
believe
that
I
should
die
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
I
think
that
I
would
like
to
die
at
home
;
and
actually
turn
back
on
my
road
,
that
I
may
get
there
soon
.
 
<EOS>
at
other
time
,
I
pass
on
farther
away
,
---
from
city
to
city
,
seek
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
,
and
try
to
leave
<EOS>
I
know
not
<EOS>
what
behind
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
in
my
power
to
retrace
,
one
by
one
,
all
the
weary
phase
of
distress
of
mind
through
which
I
pass
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
some
dream
that
can
only
be
imperfectly
and
vaguely
describe
;
and
when
I
oblige
myself
to
look
back
on
this
time
of
my
life
,
I
seem
to
be
recall
such
a
dream
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
myself
pass
on
among
the
novelty
of
foreign
town
,
palace
,
cathedral
,
temple
,
picture
,
castle
,
tomb
,
fantastic
street
---
the
old
abiding
place
of
history
and
Fancy
---
as
a
dreamer
might
;
bear
my
painful
load
through
all
,
and
hardly
conscious
of
the
object
as
they
fade
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
listlessness
to
everything
,
but
brood
sorrow
,
be
the
night
that
fall
on
my
undisciplined
heart
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
look
up
from
it
---
as
at
last
<EOS>
I
do
,
thank
Heaven
!
<EOS>
---
and
from
its
long
,
sad
,
wretched
dream
,
to
dawn
.
   
<EOS>
for
many
month
I
travel
with
this
ever
-
darken
cloud
upon
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
some
blind
reason
that
I
have
for
not
return
home
---
reason
then
struggle
within
me
,
vainly
,
for
more
distinct
expression
---
keep
me
on
my
pilgrimage
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
I
have
proceed
restlessly
from
place
to
place
,
stop
nowhere
;
sometimes
,
I
have
linger
long
in
one
spot
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
have
no
purpose
,
no
sustain
soul
within
me
,
anywhere
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
in
Switzerland
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
come
out
of
Italy
,
over
one
of
the
great
pass
of
the
Alps
,
and
have
since
wander
with
a
guide
among
the
by
-
way
of
the
mountain
.
 
<EOS>
if
those
awful
solitude
have
speak
to
my
heart
,
I
do
not
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
find
sublimity
and
wonder
in
the
dread
height
and
precipice
,
in
the
roar
torrent
,
and
the
waste
of
ice
and
snow
;
but
as
yet
,
they
have
teach
me
nothing
else
.
   
<EOS>
I
come
,
one
evening
before
sunset
,
down
into
a
valley
,
where
I
be
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
my
descent
to
it
,
by
the
wind
track
along
the
mountain
-
side
,
from
which
I
see
it
shine
far
below
,
I
think
some
long
-
unwonted
sense
of
beauty
and
tranquillity
,
some
softening
influence
awaken
by
its
peace
,
move
faintly
in
my
breast
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
pause
once
,
with
a
kind
of
sorrow
that
be
not
all
oppressive
,
not
quite
despairing
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
almost
hope
that
some
well
change
be
possible
within
me
.
   
<EOS>
I
come
into
the
valley
,
as
the
evening
sun
be
shine
on
the
remote
height
of
snow
,
that
close
it
in
,
like
eternal
cloud
.
<EOS>
the
basis
of
the
mountain
form
the
gorge
in
which
the
little
village
lie
,
be
richly
green
;
and
high
above
this
gentle
vegetation
,
grow
forest
of
dark
fir
,
cleave
the
wintry
snow
-
drift
,
wedge
-
like
,
and
stem
the
avalanche
.
 
<EOS>
above
these
,
be
range
upon
range
of
craggy
steep
,
grey
rock
,
bright
ice
,
and
smooth
verdure
-
speck
of
pasture
,
all
gradually
blend
with
the
crowning
snow
.
 
<EOS>
Dotted
here
and
there
on
the
mountain's
-
side
,
each
tiny
dot
a
home
,
be
lonely
wooden
cottage
,
<EOS>
so
dwarf
by
the
tower
height
that
they
appear
too
small
for
toy
.
 
<EOS>
so
do
even
the
clustered
village
in
the
valley
,
with
its
wooden
bridge
across
the
stream
,
where
the
stream
tumble
over
broken
rock
,
and
roar
away
among
the
tree
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
quiet
air
,
there
be
a
sound
of
distant
singing
---
shepherd
voice
;
but
,
as
one
bright
evening
cloud
float
midway
along
the
mountain's
-
side
,
I
could
almost
have
believe
it
come
from
there
,
and
be
not
earthly
music
.
 
<EOS>
all
at
once
,
in
this
serenity
,
great
Nature
speak
to
me
;
and
soothe
me
to
lay
down
my
weary
head
upon
the
grass
,
and
weep
as
I
have
not
weep
yet
,
since
Dora
die
!
   
<EOS>
I
have
find
a
packet
of
letter
await
me
but
a
few
minute
before
,
and
have
stroll
out
of
the
village
to
read
them
while
my
supper
be
make
ready
.
 
<EOS>
other
packet
have
miss
me
,
and
I
have
receive
none
for
a
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
beyond
a
line
or
two
,
to
say
that
I
be
well
,
and
have
arrive
at
such
a
place
,
I
have
not
have
fortitude
or
constancy
to
write
a
letter
since
I
leave
home
.
   
<EOS>
the
packet
be
in
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
open
it
,
and
read
the
writing
of
Agnes
.
   
<EOS>
She
be
happy
and
useful
,
be
prosper
as
she
have
hope
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
all
she
tell
me
of
herself
.
 
<EOS>
the
rest
refer
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
She
give
me
no
advice
;
she
urge
no
duty
on
me
;
she
only
tell
me
,
in
her
own
fervent
manner
,
what
her
trust
in
me
be
.
 
<EOS>
She
know
(
she
say
)
<EOS>
how
such
a
nature
as
mine
would
turn
affliction
to
good
.
 
<EOS>
She
know
how
trial
and
emotion
would
exalt
and
strengthen
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
sure
that
in
my
every
purpose
I
should
gain
a
firm
and
a
high
tendency
,
through
the
grief
I
have
undergo
.
 
<EOS>
She
,
who
so
glory
in
my
fame
,
and
so
look
forward
to
its
augmentation
,
well
know
that
I
would
labour
on
.
 
<EOS>
She
know
that
in
me
,
sorrow
could
not
be
weakness
,
but
must
be
strength
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
endurance
of
my
childish
day
have
do
its
part
to
make
me
what
I
be
,
so
great
calamity
would
nerve
me
on
,
to
be
yet
well
than
I
be
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
as
they
have
teach
me
,
would
I
teach
other
.
 
<EOS>
She
commend
me
to
God
,
who
have
take
my
innocent
darling
to
His
rest
;
and
in
her
sisterly
affection
cherish
me
always
,
and
be
always
at
my
side
go
where
I
would
;
proud
of
what
I
have
do
,
but
infinitely
prouder
yet
of
what
I
be
reserve
to
do
.
   
<EOS>
I
put
the
letter
in
my
breast
,
and
think
what
have
I
be
an
hour
ago
!
<EOS>
when
I
hear
the
voice
die
away
,
and
see
the
quiet
evening
cloud
grow
dim
,
and
all
the
colour
in
the
valley
fade
,
and
the
golden
snow
upon
the
mountain
-
top
become
a
remote
part
of
the
pale
night
sky
,
yet
feel
that
the
night
be
pass
from
my
mind
,
and
all
its
shadow
clear
,
there
be
no
name
for
the
love
I
bear
her
,
<EOS>
dearer
to
me
,
henceforward
,
than
ever
until
then
.
   
<EOS>
I
read
her
letter
many
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
write
to
her
before
I
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
that
I
have
be
in
sore
need
of
her
help
;
that
without
her
I
be
not
,
and
I
never
have
be
,
what
she
think
me
;
but
that
she
inspire
me
to
be
that
,
and
I
would
try
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
try
.
 
<EOS>
in
three
month
more
,
a
year
would
have
pass
since
the
beginning
of
my
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
determine
to
make
no
resolution
until
the
expiration
of
those
three
month
,
but
to
try
.
 
<EOS>
I
live
in
that
valley
,
and
its
neighbourhood
,
all
the
time
.
   
<EOS>
the
three
month
go
,
I
resolve
to
remain
away
from
home
for
some
time
longer
;
to
settle
myself
for
the
present
in
Switzerland
,
which
be
grow
dear
to
me
in
the
remembrance
of
that
evening
;
to
resume
my
pen
;
to
work
.
   
<EOS>
I
resort
humbly
whither
agne
have
commend
me
;
I
seek
out
Nature
,
never
seek
in
vain
;
and
I
admit
to
my
breast
the
human
interest
I
have
lately
shrink
from
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
,
before
I
have
almost
as
many
friend
in
the
valley
as
in
Yarmouth
:
<EOS>
and
when
I
leave
it
,
before
the
winter
set
in
,
for
Geneva
,
and
come
back
in
the
spring
,
their
cordial
greeting
have
a
homely
sound
to
me
,
although
they
be
not
convey
in
English
word
.
   
<EOS>
I
work
early
and
late
,
patiently
and
hard
.
 
<EOS>
I
write
a
Story
,
with
a
purpose
grow
,
not
remotely
,
out
of
my
experience
,
and
send
it
to
Traddles
,
and
he
arrange
for
its
publication
very
advantageously
for
me
;
and
the
tiding
of
my
grow
reputation
begin
to
reach
me
from
traveller
whom
I
encounter
by
chance
.
<EOS>
after
some
rest
and
change
,
I
fall
to
work
,
in
my
old
ardent
way
,
on
a
new
fancy
,
which
take
strong
possession
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
advance
in
the
execution
of
this
task
,
I
feel
it
more
and
more
,
and
rouse
my
utmost
energy
to
do
it
well
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
my
third
work
of
fiction
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
half
write
,
when
,
in
an
interval
of
rest
,
I
think
of
return
home
.
   
<EOS>
for
a
long
time
,
though
study
and
work
patiently
,
I
have
accustom
myself
to
robust
exercise
.
 
<EOS>
My
health
,
severely
impaired
when
I
leave
England
,
be
quite
restore
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
in
many
country
,
and
I
hope
I
have
improve
my
store
of
knowledge
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
now
recall
all
that
I
think
it
needful
to
recall
here
,
of
this
term
of
absence
---
with
one
reservation
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
make
it
,
thus
far
,
with
no
purpose
of
suppress
any
of
my
thought
;
for
,
as
I
have
elsewhere
say
,
this
narrative
be
my
write
memory
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
desire
to
keep
the
most
secret
current
of
my
mind
apart
,
and
to
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
I
enter
on
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
so
completely
penetrate
the
mystery
of
my
own
heart
,
as
to
know
when
I
begin
to
think
that
I
may
have
set
its
early
and
bright
hope
on
Agnes
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
at
what
stage
of
my
grief
it
first
become
associated
with
the
reflection
,
that
,
in
my
wayward
boyhood
,
I
have
throw
away
the
treasure
of
her
love
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
may
have
hear
some
whisper
of
that
distant
thought
,
in
the
old
unhappy
loss
or
want
of
something
never
to
be
realize
,
of
which
I
have
be
sensible
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
thought
come
into
my
mind
as
a
new
reproach
and
new
regret
,
when
I
be
leave
so
sad
and
lonely
in
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
if
,
at
that
time
,
I
have
be
much
with
her
,
I
should
,
in
the
weakness
of
my
desolation
,
have
betray
this
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
what
I
remotely
dread
when
I
be
first
impel
to
stay
away
from
England
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
bear
to
lose
the
small
portion
of
her
sisterly
affection
;
yet
,
in
that
betrayal
,
I
should
have
set
a
constraint
between
us
hitherto
unknown
.
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
forget
that
the
feeling
with
which
she
now
regard
me
have
grow
up
in
my
own
free
choice
and
course
.
 
<EOS>
that
if
she
have
ever
love
me
with
another
love
---
and
I
sometimes
think
the
time
be
when
she
may
have
do
so
---
I
have
cast
it
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
nothing
,
now
,
that
I
have
accustom
myself
to
think
of
her
,
when
we
be
both
mere
child
,
as
one
who
be
far
remove
from
my
wild
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
bestow
my
passionate
tenderness
upon
another
object
;
and
what
I
may
have
do
,
I
have
not
do
;
and
what
Agnes
be
to
me
,
I
and
her
own
noble
heart
have
make
her
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
beginning
of
the
change
that
gradually
work
in
me
,
when
I
try
to
get
a
well
understanding
of
myself
and
be
a
well
man
,
I
do
glance
,
through
some
indefinite
probation
,
to
a
period
when
I
may
possibly
hope
to
cancel
the
mistaken
past
,
and
to
be
so
bless
as
to
marry
her
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
time
wear
on
,
this
shadowy
prospect
fade
,
and
depart
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
have
ever
love
me
,
then
,
I
should
hold
her
the
more
sacred
;
remember
the
confidence
I
have
repose
in
her
,
her
knowledge
of
my
errant
heart
,
the
sacrifice
she
must
have
make
to
be
my
friend
and
sister
,
and
the
victory
she
have
win
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
have
never
love
me
,
could
I
believe
that
she
would
love
me
now
?
   
<EOS>
I
have
always
feel
my
weakness
,
in
comparison
with
her
constancy
and
fortitude
;
and
now
I
feel
it
more
and
more
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
I
may
have
be
to
her
,
or
she
to
me
,
if
I
have
be
more
worthy
of
her
long
ago
,
I
be
not
now
,
and
she
be
not
.
 
<EOS>
the
time
be
past
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
let
it
go
by
,
and
have
deservedly
lose
her
.
   
<EOS>
that
I
suffer
much
in
these
contention
,
that
they
fill
me
with
unhappiness
and
remorse
,
and
yet
that
I
have
a
sustaining
sense
that
it
be
require
of
me
,
in
right
and
honour
,
to
keep
away
from
myself
,
with
shame
,
the
thought
of
turn
to
the
dear
girl
in
the
withering
of
my
hope
,
from
whom
I
have
frivolously
turn
when
they
be
bright
and
fresh
---
which
consideration
be
at
the
root
of
every
thought
I
have
concern
her
---
be
all
equally
true
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
no
effort
to
conceal
from
myself
,
now
,
that
I
love
her
,
that
I
be
devoted
to
her
;
but
I
bring
the
assurance
home
to
myself
,
that
it
be
now
too
late
,
and
that
our
long
-
subsist
relation
must
be
undisturbed
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
think
,
much
and
often
,
of
my
Dora
's
shadow
out
to
me
what
may
have
happen
,
in
those
year
that
be
destine
not
to
try
us
;
I
have
consider
how
the
thing
that
never
happen
,
be
often
as
much
reality
to
us
,
in
their
effect
,
as
those
that
be
accomplish
.
 
<EOS>
the
very
year
she
speak
of
,
be
reality
now
,
for
my
correction
;
and
would
have
be
,
one
day
,
a
little
later
perhaps
,
though
we
have
part
in
our
early
folly
.
 
<EOS>
I
endeavour
to
convert
what
may
have
be
between
myself
and
Agnes
,
into

thus
,
through
the
reflection
that

I
arrive
at
the
conviction

it

never

these

of
my

my
departure

the
time

my

three

<EOS>
three
year
have
elapse
since
the
sailing
of
the
emigrant
ship
;
when
,
at
that
same
hour
of
sunset
,
and
in
the
same
place
,
I
stand
on
the
deck
of
the
packet
vessel
that
bring
me
home
,
look
on
the
rosy
water
where
I
have

<EOS>
return
 
<EOS>
I
land
in
London
on
a
wintry
autumn
evening
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
dark
and
rain
,
and
I
see
more
fog
and
mud
in
a
minute
than
I
have
see
in
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk
from
the
Custom
House
to
the
Monument
before
I
find
a
coach
;
and
although
the
very
house
-
front
,
look
on
the
swollen
gutter
,
be
like
old
friend
to
me
,
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
admit
that
they
be
very
dingy
friend
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
often
remark
---
I
suppose
everybody
have
---
that
one
be
go
away
from
a
familiar
place
,
would
seem
to
be
the
signal
for
change
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
look
out
of
the
coach
window
,
and
observe
that
an
old
house
on
fish
-
street
Hill
,
which
have
stand
untouched
by
painter
,
carpenter
,
or
bricklayer
,
for
a
century
,
have
be
pull
down
in
my
absence
;
and
that
a
neighbour
street
,
of
time
-
honour
insalubrity
and
inconvenience
,
be
be
drain
and
widen
;
I
half
expect
to
find
St
Paul
's
Cathedral
look
old
.
   
<EOS>
for
some
change
in
the
fortune
of
my
friend
,
I
be
prepared
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
have
long
be
re
-
establish
at
Dover
,
and
Traddles
have
begin
to
get
into
some
little
practice
at
the
Bar
,
in
the
very
first
term
after
my
departure
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
chamber
in
Gray
's
Inn
,
now
;
and
have
tell
me
,
in
his
last
letter
,
that
he
be
not
without
hope
of
be
soon
unite
to
the
dear
girl
in
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
They
expect
me
home
before
Christmas
;
but
have
no
idea
of
my
return
so
soon
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
purposely
mislead
them
,
that
I
may
have
the
pleasure
of
take
them
by
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
,
I
be
perverse
enough
to
feel
a
chill
and
disappointment
in
receive
no
welcome
,
and
rattle
,
alone
and
silent
,
through
the
misty
street
.
   
<EOS>
the
well
-
know
shop
,
however
,
with
their
cheerful
light
,
do
something
for
me
;
and
when
I
alight
at
the
door
of
the
Gray
's
Inn
Coffee
-
house
,
I
have
recover
my
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
It
recall
,
at
first
,
that
so
-
different
time
when
I
have
put
up
at
the
Golden
Cross
,
and
remind
me
of
the
change
that
have
come
to
pass
since
then
;
but
that
be
natural
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
where
Mr
Traddles
live
in
the

ask
the

the

<EOS>

he

I

"
   
<EOS>
this
waiter
,
who
be
middle
-
aged
and
spare
,
look
for
help
to
a
waiter
of
more
authority
---
a
stout
,
potential
old
man
,
with
a
double
chin
,
in
black
breech
and
stocking
,
who
come
out
of
a
place
like
a
churchwarden
's
pew
,
at
the
end
of
the
coffee
-
room
,
where
he
keep
company
with
a
cash

box
,
a
Directory
,
a

,
and
other
book
and
paper

say
the

"

two
in
the
Court

"
   
<EOS>
the
potential
waiter
wave
him
away
,
and
turn
,
gravely
,
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
inquire
,
"
say
I
,
"
whether
Mr
Traddles
,
at
number
two
in
the
Court
,
have
not
a
rise
reputation
among
the
lawyer
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
never
hear
his
name
,
"
say
the
waiter
,
in
a
rich
husky
voice
.
   
<EOS>
I
feel
quite
apologetic
for
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
young
man
,
sure
?
<EOS>
"
say
the
portentous
waiter
,
fix
his
eye
severely
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
long
have
he
be
in
the
Inn
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
not
above
three
year
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
the
waiter
,
who
I
suppose
have
live
in
his
churchwarden
's
pew
for
forty
year
,
could
not
pursue
such
an
insignificant
subject
.
 
<EOS>
He
ask
me
what
I
would
have
for
dinner
?
   
<EOS>
I
feel
I
be
in
England
again
,
and
really
be
quite
cast
down
on
Traddles
's
account
.
 
<EOS>
there
seem
to
be
no
hope
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
meekly
order
a
bit
of
fish
and
a
steak
,
and
stand
before
the
fire
muse
on
his
obscurity
.
   
<EOS>
as
I
follow
the
chief
waiter
with
my
eye
,
I
could
not
help
think
that
the
garden
in
which
he
have
gradually
blow
to
be
the
flower
he
be
,
be
an
arduous
place
to
rise
in
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
such
a
prescriptive
,
stiff
-
necked
,
long
-
establish
,
solemn
,
elderly
air
.
<EOS>
I
glance
about
the
room
,
which
have
have
its
sanded
floor
sanded
,
no
doubt
,
in
exactly
the
same
manner
when
the
chief
waiter
be
a
boy
---
if
he
ever
be
a
boy
,
which
appear
improbable
;
and
at
the
shine
table
,
where
I
see
myself
reflect
,
in
unruffled
depth
of
old
mahogany
;
and
at
the
lamp
,
without
a
flaw
in
their
trimming
or
clean
;
and
at
the
comfortable
green
curtain
,
with
their
pure
brass
rod
,
snugly
enclose
the
box
;
and
at
the
two
large
coal
fire
,
brightly
burn
;
and
at
the
row
of
decanter
,
burly
as
if
with
the
consciousness
of
pipe
of
expensive
old
port
wine
below
;
and
both
England
,
and
the
law
,
appear
to
me
to
be
very
difficult
indeed
to
be
take
by
storm
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
up
to
my
bedroom
to
change
my
wet
clothe
;
and
the
vast
extent
of
that
old
wainscote
apartment
(
which
be
over
the
archway
lead
to
the
Inn
,
I
remember
)
,
and
the
sedate
immensity
of
the
four
-
post
bedstead
,
and
the
indomitable
gravity
of
the
chest
of
drawer
,
all
seem
to
unite
in
sternly
frown
on
the
fortune
of
Traddles
,
or
on
any
such
daring
youth
.
<EOS>
I
come
down
again
to
my
dinner
;
and
even
the
slow
comfort
of
the
meal
,
and
the
orderly
silence
of
the
place
---
which
be
bare
of
guest
,
the
Long
Vacation
not
yet
be
over
---
be
eloquent
on
the
audacity
of
Traddles
,
and
his
small
hope
of
a
livelihood
for
twenty
year
to
come
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
see
nothing
like
this
since
I
go
away
,
and
it
quite
dash
my
hope
for
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
the
chief
waiter
have
have
enough
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
near
me
no
more
;
but
devote
himself
to
an
old
gentleman
in
long
gaiter
,
to
meet
whom
a
pint
of
special
port
seem
to
come
out
of
the
cellar
of
its
own
accord
,
for
he
give
no
order
.
 
<EOS>
the
second
waiter
inform
me
,
in
a
whisper
,
that
this
old
gentleman
be
a
retired
conveyancer
live
in
the
Square
,
and
worth
a
mint
of
money
,
which
it
be
expect
he
would
leave
to
his
laundress
's
daughter
;
likewise
that
it
be
rumour
that
he
have
a
service
of
plate
in
a
bureau
,
all
tarnish
with
lying
by
,
though
more
than
one
spoon
and
a
fork
have
never
yet
be
behold
in
his
chamber
by
mortal
vision
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
I
quite
give
traddle
up
for
lost
;
and
settle
in
my
own
mind
that
there
be
no
hope
for
him
.
   
<EOS>
be
very
anxious
to
see
the
dear
old
fellow
,
nevertheless
,
I
dispatch
my
dinner
,
in
a
manner
not
at
all
calculate
to
raise
me
in
the
opinion
of
the
chief
waiter
,
and
hurry
out
by
the
back
way
.
 
<EOS>
Number
two
in
the
Court
be
soon
reach
;
and
an
inscription
on
the
door
-
post
inform
me
that
Mr
Traddles
occupy
a
set
of
chamber
on
the
top
storey
<EOS>
,
I
ascend
the
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
a
crazy
old
staircase
<EOS>
I
find
it
to
be
,
feebly
light
on
each
landing
by
a
club
-
head
little
oil
wick
,
die
away
in
a
little
dungeon
of
dirty
glass
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
my
stumble
upstairs
,
I
fancy
I
hear
a
pleasant
sound
of
laughter
;
and
not
the
laughter
of
an
attorney
or
barrister
,
or
attorney
's
clerk
or
barrister
's
clerk
,
but
of
two
or
three
merry
girl
.
 
<EOS>
happening
,
however
,
as
I
stop
to
listen
,
to
put
my
foot
in
a
hole
where
the
honourable
Society
of
Gray
's
Inn
have
leave
a
plank
deficient
,
I
fall
down
with
some
noise
,
and
when
I
recover
my
footing
all
be
silent
.
   
<EOS>
grope
my
way
more
carefully
,
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
,
my
heart
beat
high
when
I
find
the
outer
door
,
which
have
Mr
traddle
paint
on
it
,
open
.
 
<EOS>
I
knock
.
 
<EOS>
a
considerable
scuffling
within
ensue
,
but
nothing
else
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
knock
again
.
   
<EOS>
a
small
sharp
-
look
lad
,
half
-
footboy
and
half
-
clerk
,
who
be
very
much
out
of
breath

but
who
look
at
me
as

he
defy
me
to
prove
it
legally

present
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
Mr
Traddles

"
<EOS>
yes

"
   
<EOS>
after
a
moment
's
survey
of
me
,
the
sharp

look
lad
decide
to
let
me
in
;
and
open
the
door
wider
for
that
purpose
,
admit
me
,
first
,
into
a
little
closet
of
a
hall
,
and
next
into
a
little
sitting

room
;
where
I
come
into
the
presence
of
my
old
friend
(
also
out
of
breath

,
seat
at
a
table

bend
over

never

have
clap

into

great

go
down

some
serious
conversation

I
be
afraid

be
wander
from
the
subject

<EOS>
do
I
mention
the
Reverend
Horace
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
say
that
you
dwelt
upon
the
fact

<EOS>
"
   
"
true
!
<EOS>
upon
the
fact
that
Sophy
and
I
have
be
engage
for
a
long
period
,
and
that
Sophy
,
with
the
permission
of
her
parent
,
be
more
than
content
to
take
me
---
in
short
,
"

Traddles
,
with
his
old
frank
smile
,
"
on
our
present
Britannia
-
metal
footing
.
 
<EOS>
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
propose
to
the
Reverend
Horace
---
who
be
a
most
excellent
clergyman
,
Copperfield
,
and
ought
to
be
a
Bishop
;
or
at
least
ought
to
have
enough
to
live
upon
,
without
pinch
himself
---
that
if
I
could
turn
the
corner
,
say
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
pound
,
in
one
year
;
and
could
see
my
way
pretty
clearly
to
that
,
or
something
well
,
next
year
;
and
could
plainly
furnish
a
little
place
like
this
,
besides
;
then
,
and
in
that
case
,
Sophy
<EOS>
and
I
should
be
unite
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
the
liberty
of
represent
that
we
have
be
patient
for
a
good
many
year
;
and
that
the
circumstance
of
Sophy
's
be
extraordinarily
useful
at
home
,
ought
not
to
operate
with
her
affectionate
parent
,
against
her
establishment
in
life
---
do
not
you
see
?
"
   
"
certainly
it
ought
not
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
you
think
so
,
<EOS>
Copperfield
,
"
rejoin
traddle

"
because
,
without
any
imputation
on
the
Reverend
Horace
,
I
do
think
parent
,
and
brother
,

so
forth
,
be
sometimes
rather
selfish
in
such
case

<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
I
also
point
out
,
that
my
most
earnest
desire
be

to
be
useful
to
the
family

and
that
if
I
get
on
in

anything
should
happen
to
him

I
refer
to
the
Reverend
Horace

"
   
"
I
understand
,
"

I.
   
"
---
<EOS>
or
to
Mrs
Crewler

it
would
be
the
utmost
gratification
of
my
wish
,
to
be
a
parent
to
the
girl

He
reply
in
a
most
admirable
manner
,
exceedingly
flattering
to
my
feeling
,

undertake
to
obtain
the
consent
of
Mrs
Crewler
to
this
arrangement

They
have
a
dreadful
time
of
it
with
her

<EOS>
It
mount
from
her
leg
into
her
chest
,
and
then
into
her
head
---
"
   
"
what
mount
?

"
I
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
Her
grief

serious
look

Her
feeling
generally

as
I
mention
on

she
be
a
very
superior
woman
,
but
have
lose
the
use
of
her
limb
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
occur
to
harass
her
,
usually
settle
in
her
leg
;
but
on
this
occasion
it
mount
to
the
chest
,
and
then
to
the
head
,
and
,
in
short
,
pervade
the
whole
system
in
a
most
alarming
manner
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
they
bring
her
through
it
by
unremitte
and
affectionate
attention
;
and
we
be
marry
yesterday
six
week

<EOS>
You
have
no
idea
what
a
monster
<EOS>
I
feel
,
Copperfield

when
I
see
the
whole
family
cry
and
faint
away

every
direction

<EOS>
Mrs

could
not
see
me
before

leave

could
not
forgive
me
,
then
,
for
deprive
her
of

child

but
she
be
a
good
creature

do
so

have
a
delightful

indeed

I

instant
miss
the
tea
-
spoon
that
be
still
to
be
win
,
I
have
no
doubt
it
be
when
he
hand
the
Beauty
her
tea
.
 
<EOS>
if
his
sweet
-
tempered
wife
could
have
get
up
any
self
-
assertion
against
anyone
,
I
be
satisfied
it
could
only
have
be
because
she
be
the
Beauty
's
sister
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
slight
indication
of
a
rather
petted
and
capricious
manner
,
which
I
observe
in
the
Beauty
,
be
manifestly
consider
,
by
Traddles
and
his
wife
,
as
her
birthright
and
natural
endowment
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
have
be
bear
a
Queen
Bee
,
and
they
labour
Bees
,
they
could
not
have
be
more
satisfied
of
that
.
   
<EOS>
but
their
self
-
forgetfulness
charm
me
.
 
<EOS>
Their
pride
in
these
girl
,
and
their
submission
of
themselves
to
all
their
whim
,
be
the
pleasantest
little
testimony
to
their
own
worth
I
could
have
desire
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
if
traddle
be
address
as
"
a
darling
"
,
once
in
the
course
of
that
evening
;
and
besought
to
bring
something
here
,
or
carry
something
there
,
or
take
something
up
,
or
put
something
down
,
or
find
something
,
or
fetch
something
,
he
be
so
address
,
by
one
or
other
of
his
sister
-
in
-
law
,
at
least
twelve
time
in
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
neither
could
they
do
anything
without
Sophy
.
 
<EOS>
somebody
's
hair
fall
down
,
and
nobody
but
Sophy
could
put
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
somebody
forget
how
a
particular
tune
go
,
and
nobody
but
Sophy
could
hum
that
tune
right
.
 
<EOS>
somebody
want
to
recall
the
name
of
a
place
in
Devonshire
,
and
only
Sophy
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
something
be
want
to
be
write
home
,
and
Sophy
alone
could
be
trust
to
write
before
breakfast
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
somebody
break
down
in
a
piece
of
knitting
,
and
no
one
but
Sophy
be
able
to
put
the
defaulter
in
the
right
direction
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
entire
mistress
of
the
place
,
and
Sophy
and
Traddles
wait
on
them
.
 
<EOS>
how
many
child
Sophy
could
have
take
care
of
in
her
time
,
I
can
not
imagine
;
but
she
seem
to
be
famous
for
know
every
sort
of
song
that
ever
be
address
to
a
child
in
the
english
tongue
;
and
she
sing
dozen
to
order
with
the
clear
little
voice
in
the
world
,
one
after
another
(
every
sister
issue
direction
for
a
different
tune
,
and
the
Beauty
generally
strike
in
last
)
,
so
that
I
be
quite
fascinated
.
 
<EOS>
the
good
of
all
be
,
that
,
in
the
midst
of
their
exaction
,
all
the
sister
have
a
great
tenderness
and
respect
both
for
Sophy
and
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
,
when
I
take
my
leave
,
and
Traddles
be
come
out
to
walk
with
me
to
the
coffee
-
house
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
have
never
see
an
obstinate
head
of
hair
,
or
any
other
head
of
hair
,
roll
about
in
such
a
shower
of
kiss
.
   
<EOS>
altogether
,
it
be
a
scene
I
could
not
help
dwell
on
with
pleasure
,
for
a
long
time
after
I
get
back
and
have
wish
Traddles
good
night
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
behold
a
thousand
rose
blow
in
a
top
set
of
chamber
,
in
that
withered
Gray
's
Inn
,
they
could
not
have
brighten
it
half
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
the
idea
of
those
Devonshire
girl
,
among
the
dry
law
-
stationer
and
the
attorney
'
office
;
and
of
the
tea
and
toast
,
and
child
's
song
,
in
that
grim
atmosphere
of
pounce
and
parchment
,
red
-
tape
,
dusty
wafer
,
ink
-
jar
,
brief
and
draft
paper
,
law
report
,
writ
,
declaration
,
and
bill
of
cost
;
seem
almost
as
pleasantly
fanciful
as
if
I
have
dream
that
the
Sultan
's
famous
family
have
be
admit
on
the
roll
of
attorney
,
and
have
bring
the
talking
bird
,
the
singing
tree
,
and
the
golden
water
into
Gray
's
Inn
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
somehow
,
I
find
that
I
have
take
leave
of
traddle
for
the
night
,
and
come
back
to
the
coffee
-
house
,
with
a
great
change
in
my
despondency
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
he
would
get
on
,
in
spite
of
all
the
many
order
of
chief
waiter
in
England
.
   
<EOS>
draw
a
chair
before
one
of
the
coffee
-
room
fire
to
think
about
him
at
my
leisure
,
I
gradually
fall
from
the
consideration
of
his
happiness
to
trace
prospect
in
the
live
-
coal
,
and
to
think
,
as
they
break
and
change
,
of
the
principal
vicissitude
and
separation
that
have
mark
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
a
coal
fire
,
since
I
have
leave
England
three
year
ago
:
though
many
a
wood
fire
have
I
watch
,
as
it
crumble
into
hoary
ashe
,
and
mingle
with
the
feathery
heap
upon
the
hearth
,
which
not
inaptly
figure
to
me
,
in
my
despondency
,
my
own
dead
hope
.
   
<EOS>
I
could
think
of
the
past
now
,
gravely
,
but
not
bitterly
;
and
could
contemplate
the
future
in
a
brave
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
Home
,
in
its
good
sense
,
be
for
me
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
She
in
whom
I
may
have
inspire
a
dearer
love
<EOS>
,
I
have
teach
to
be
my
sister
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
marry
,
and
would
have
new
claimant
on
her
tenderness
;
and
in
do
it
,
would
never
know
the
love
for
her
that
have
grow
up
in
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
right
that
I
should
pay
the
forfeit
of
my
headlong
passion
.
 
<EOS>
what
I
reap
,
I
have
sow
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
think
.
 
<EOS>
and
have
I
truly
discipline
my
heart
to
this
,
and
could
I
resolutely
bear
it
,
and
calmly
hold
the
place
in
her
home
which
she
have
calmly
hold
in
mine
,
---
when
I
find
my
eye
rest
on
a
countenance
that
may
have
arise
out
of
the
fire
,
in
its
association
with
my
early
remembrance
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Mr
Chillip
the
Doctor
,
to
whose
good
office
<EOS>
I
be
indebte
in
the
very
first
chapter
of
this
history
,
sit
read
a
newspaper
in
the
shadow
of
an
opposite
corner
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
tolerably
stricken
in
year
by
this
time
;
but
,
be
a
mild
,
meek
,
calm
little
man
,
have
wear
so
easily
,
<EOS>
that
I
think
he
look
at
that
moment
just
as
he
may
have
look
when
he
sit
in
our
parlour
,
wait
for
me
to
be
bear
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Chillip
have
leave
Blunderstone
six
or
seven
year
ago
,
and
I
have
never
see
him
since
.
 
<EOS>
He
sit
placidly
peruse
the
newspaper
,
with
his
little
head
on
one
side
,
and
a
glass
of
warm
sherry
negus
at
his
elbow
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
so
extremely
conciliatory
in
his
manner
that
he
seem
to
apologize
to
the
very
newspaper
for
take
the
liberty
of
read
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
walk
up
to
where
he
be
sit
,
and
say
,
"
how
do
you
do
,
Mr
Chillip
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
be
greatly
flutter
by
this
unexpected
address
from
a
stranger
,
and
reply
,
in
his
slow
way
,
"
I
thank
you
,
sir
,
you
be
very
good
.
 
<EOS>
thank
you
,
sir

<EOS>
I
hope
you

"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
remember
me
?
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
"
return
Mr
Chillip
,
smile
very
meekly
,
and
shake
his
head
as
he
survey
me
,
"
I
have
a
kind
of
an
impression
that
something
in
your
countenance
be
familiar
to
me
,
sir
;
but
I
could
not
lay
my
hand
upon
your
name
,
really
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
yet
you
know
it

long
before
I

myself

"
I
return
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
I
indeed

sir

"
say
Mr
Chillip

<EOS>
"
be
it
possible
that
I
have
the
honour
,
sir

of
officiating
when

"
   
<EOS>
"
yes

"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
dear
me

cry
Mr
Chillip

<EOS>
"
but
no
doubt
you
be
a
good
deal
change
since
then

"
   
<EOS>
"
probably
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
well

"
observe
Mr
Chillip
,
"
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
excuse
me
,
if
I
be
compel
to
ask
the
favour
of
your
name
?
"
   
<EOS>
on
my
tell
him
my
name
,
he
be
really
move
.
 
<EOS>
He
quite
shake
hand
with
me
---
which
be
a
violent
proceeding
for
him
,
his
usual
course
be
to
slide
a
tepid
little
fish
-
slice
,
an
inch
or
two
in
advance
of
his
hip
,
and
evince
the
great
discomposure
when
anybody
grapple
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
even
now
,
he
put
his
hand
in
his
coat
-
pocket
as
soon
as
he
could
disengage
it
,
and
seem
relieved
when
he
have
get
it
safe
back
.
   
<EOS>
"
dear
me
,
sir

"
say
Mr
Chillip
,
survey
me
with
his
head
on
one
side

<EOS>
"
and
it
be
Mr
Copperfield
,
be
it
?
 
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
I
think
I
should
have
know
you
,
if
I
have
take
the
liberty
of
look
more
closely
at
you
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
strong
resemblance
between
you
and
your
poor
father

sir

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
have
the
happiness
of

my

I
observe
.
   
<EOS>
"
very
true

Mr

in
a
soothing
tone

on
all

<EOS>
We

Mr

slowly
shake
his
little
head
again
,
"
down
in
our

the
country

of
your

<EOS>
there
must
be
great
excitement

tap

I

<EOS>
I
find
it
not
difficult

in
the
excitement
of
Mr

under

potation

negus

divert
his

I

go
down

the
Dragon

early

the

almost
immediately
call
for
a

not
quite
safe
anywhere
else

He
do
not
actually
stagger
under
the
negus

I
should
think
his
placid
little
pulse
must
have
make
two

three
more
beat
in

minute

it
have
do

her
own
good
time
.
 
<EOS>
a
sister
to
whom
I
have
confide
so
much
,
aunt
,
will
not
be
reluctant
to
confide
in
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
withdraw
her
eye
from
mine
,
as
slowly
as
she
have
turn
them
upon
me
;
and
cover
them
thoughtfully
with
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
by
and
by
<EOS>
she
put
her
other
hand
on
my
shoulder
;
and
so
we
both
sit
,
look
into
the
past
,
without
say
another
word
,
until
we
part
for
the
night
.
   
<EOS>
I
ride
away
,
early
in
the
morning
,
for
the
scene
of
my
old
school
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
I
be
yet
quite
happy
,
in
the
hope
that
I
be
gain
a
victory
over
myself
;
even
in
the
prospect
of
so
soon
look
on
her
face
again
.
   
<EOS>
the
well
-
remember
ground
be
soon
traverse
,
and
I
come
into
the
quiet
street
,
where
every
stone
be
a
boy
's
book
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
on
foot
to
the
old
house
,
and
go
away
with
a
heart
too
full
to
enter
.
 
<EOS>
I
return
;
and
look
,
as
I
pass
,
through
the
low
window
of
the
turret
-
room
where
first
Uriah
Heep
,
and
afterwards
Mr
Micawber
,
have
be
will
not
to
sit
,
see
that
it
be
a
little
parlour
now
,
and
that
there
be
no
office
.
 
<EOS>
otherwise
the
staid
old
house
be
,
as
to
its
cleanliness
and
order
,
still
just
as
it
have
be
when
I
first
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
request
the
new
maid
who
admit
me
,
to
tell
Miss
Wickfield
that
a
gentleman
who
wait
on
her
from
a
friend
abroad
,
be
there
;
and
I
be
show
up
the
grave
old
staircase
<EOS>
(
caution
of
the
step
I
know
so
well
)
,
into
the
unchanged
drawing
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
the
book
that
Agnes
and
I
have
read
together
,
be
on
their
shelf
;
and
the
desk
where
I
have
labour
at
my
lesson
,
many
a
night
,
stand
yet
at
the
same
old
corner
of
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
little
change
that
have
creep
in
when
the
Heeps
be
there
,
be
change
again
.
 
<EOS>
everything
be
as
it
use
to
be
,
in
the
happy
time
.
   
<EOS>
I
stand
in
a
window
,
and
look
across
the
ancient
street
at
the
opposite
house
,
recall
how
I
have
watch
them
on
wet
afternoon
,
when
I
first
come
there
;
and
how
I
have
use
to
speculate
about
the
people
who
appear
at
any
of
the
window
,
and
have
follow
them
with
my
eye
up
and
down
stair
,
while
woman
go
click
along
the
pavement
in
pattens
,
and
the
dull
rain
fall
in
slant
line
,
and
pour
out
of
the
water
-
spout
yonder
,
and
flow
into
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
the
feeling
with
which
I
use
to
watch
the
tramp
,
as
they
come
into
the
town
on
those
wet
evening
,
at
dusk
,
and
limp
past
,
with
their
bundle
droop
over
their
shoulder
at
the
end
of
stick
,
come
freshly
back
to
me
;
fraught
,
as
then
,
with
the
smell
of
damp
earth
,
and
wet
leave
and
briar
,
and
the
sensation
of
the
very
air
that
blow
upon
me
in
my
own
toilsome
journey
.
   
<EOS>
the
opening
of
the
little
door
in
the
panel
wall
make
me
start
and
turn
.
 
<EOS>
Her
beautiful
serene
eye
meet
mine
as
she
come
towards
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
stop
and
lay
her
hand
upon
her
bosom
,
and
I
catch
her
in
my
arm
.
   
<EOS>
"
agne
!
<EOS>
my
dear
girl
!
<EOS>
I
have
come
too
suddenly
upon
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no

no

<EOS>
I
be
so

"
Dear
agne
,
the
happiness
<EOS>
it
be
to
me
,
to
see
you
once
again
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
fold
her
to
my
heart
,
and
,
for
a
little
while
,
we
be
both
silent
.
 
<EOS>
presently
we
sit
down
,
side
by
side
;
and
her
angel
-
face
be
turn
upon
me
with
the
welcome
I
have
dream
of
,
wake
and
sleep
,
for
whole
year
.
   
<EOS>
She
be
so
true
,
she
be
so
beautiful
<EOS>
,
she
be
so
good
,
---
I
owe
her
so
much
gratitude
,
she
be
so
dear
to
me
,
that
I
could
find
no
utterance
for
what
I
feel
.
 
<EOS>
I
try
to
bless
her
,
try
to
thank
her
,
try
to
tell
her
(
as
I
have
often
do
in
letter
)
<EOS>
what
an
influence
she
have
upon
me
;
but
all
my
effort
be
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
My
love
and
joy
be
dumb
.
   
<EOS>
with
her
own
sweet
tranquillity
,
she
calm
my
agitation
;
lead
me
back
to
the
time
of
our
parting
;
speak
to
me
of
Emily
,
whom
she
have
visit
,
in
secret
,
many
time
;
speak
to
me
tenderly
of
Dora
's
grave
.
 
<EOS>
with
the
unerring
instinct
of
her
noble
heart
,
she
touch
the
chord
of
my
memory
so
softly
and
harmoniously
,
that
not
one
jar
within
me
;
I
could
listen
to
the
sorrowful
,
distant
music
,
and
desire
to
shrink
from
nothing
it
awake
.
 
<EOS>
how
could
I
,
when
,
blend
with
it
all
,
be
her
dear
self
,
the
well
angel
of
my
life
?
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
you
,
Agnes

"
I
say
,
by
and
by
.
 
<EOS>
"
tell
me
of
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
hardly
ever
tell
me
of
your
own
life
,
in
all
this
lapse
of
time
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
what
should
I
tell
?
"
<EOS>
she
answer
,
with
her
radiant
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
Papa
be
well

<EOS>
You
see
us
here
,
quiet
in

<EOS>
"
all

Agnes

say
I.
   
She
look
at
me
,
with
some
flutter
wonder
in
her
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
there
nothing
else
,
Sister

I
say
.
   
<EOS>
Her
colour
,
which
have
just
now
fade

return
,
and
fade
again
.
<EOS>
She
smile
;
with
a
quiet
sadness
,
I
think
;
and
shake
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
seek
to
lead
her
to
what
my
aunt
have
hint
at
;
for
,
sharply
painful
to
me
as
it
must
be
to
receive
that
confidence
,
I
be
to
discipline
my
heart
,
and
do
my
duty
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
,
however
,
that
she
be
uneasy
,
and
I
let
it
pass
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
much
to
do
,
dear
agne

<EOS>

with
my
school

look
up
again

her
bright
composure

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
It
be
laborious
,
be
it
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
the
labour
be
so
pleasant
,
"
she
return
,
"
that
it
be
scarcely
grateful
in
me
to
call
it
by
that
name
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
nothing
good
be
difficult
to
you

"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
Her
colour
come
and
go
once
more
;
and
once
more
,
as
she
bend
her
head
<EOS>
,
I
see
the
same
sad
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
wait
and
see
papa
,
"
say
Agnes
,
cheerfully
,
"
and
pass
the
day
with
us
?
 
<EOS>
perhaps
you
will
sleep
in
your
own
room
?
 
<EOS>
We
always
call
it
yours

"
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
do
that
,
have
promise
to
ride
back
to
my
aunt
's
at
night
;
but
I
would
pass
the
day
there
,
joyfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
be
a
prisoner
for
a
little
while

agne

here

pleasure

Agnes

"
while

Heaven

every

Agnes

with

cordial
eye
turn
cheerfully
upon

have
be

welcome
companion

the
basket

trifle

full

key

at

side

a
kind
of
old
tune

"
   
<EOS>
She
smile
again
,
and
go
out
at
the
door
by
which
she
have
come
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
for
me
to
guard
this
sisterly
affection
with
religious
care
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
that
I
have
leave
myself
,
and
it
be
a
treasure
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
once
shake
the
foundation
of
the
sacred
confidence
and
usage
,
in
virtue
of
which
<EOS>
it
be
give
to
me
,
it
be
lose
,
and
could
never
be
recover
.
 
<EOS>
I
set
this
steadily
before
myself
.
 
<EOS>
the
well
I
love
her
,
the
more
it
behove
me
never
to
forget
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
walk
through
the
street
;
and
,
once
more
see
my
old
adversary
<EOS>
the
butcher
---
now
a
constable
,
with
his
staff
hang
up
in
the
shop
---
go
down
to
look
at
the
place
where
I
have
fight
him
;
and
there
meditate
on
Miss
Shepherd
and
the
eld
Miss
Larkins
,
and
all
the
idle
love
and
liking
,
and
disliking
,
of
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
seem
to
have
survive
that
time
but
Agnes
;
and
she
,
ever
a
star
above
me
,
be
bright
and
high
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
return
,
Mr
Wickfield
have
come
home
,
from
a
garden
he
have
,
a
couple
of
mile
or
so
out
of
town
,
where
he
now
employ
himself
almost
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
him
as
my
aunt
have
describe
him
.
 
<EOS>
We
sit
down
to
dinner
,
with
some
half
-
dozen
little
girl
;
and
he
seem
but
the
shadow
of
his
handsome
picture
on
the
wall
.
   
<EOS>
the
tranquillity
and
peace
belonging
,
of
old

to
that
quiet
ground
in
my
memory
,
pervade
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
when
dinner
be
do
,
Mr
Wickfield
take
no
wine
,
and
I
desire
none
,
we
go
up

stair
;
where
Agnes
and
her
little
charge
sing
and
play
,
and
work
.
<EOS>
after
tea
the
child
leave
us
;
and
we
three
sit
together
,
talk
of
the
bygone
day
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
part
in
them

"
say
Mr
Wickfield
,
shake
his
white
head

for
deep
regret

look

I

such

She

him

be
very

very
pale

"

well

he
say
with
a
sigh

dismissing

as
I
then
see

some
trial
she
have
bear

I

you

His
bowed
head
,
and
her
angel
-
face
and
filial
duty
,
derive
a
more
pathetic
meaning
from
it
than
they
have
have
before

<EOS>
if
I
have
want
anything
by
which
to
mark
this
night
of
our
re
-
union

I
should
have
find
it
in
this

<EOS>
agne
rise
up
from
her
father
's
side
,
before
long
;
and
go
softly
to
her
piano
,
play
some
of
the
old
air
to
which
we
have
often
listen
in
that
place
.
   
<EOS>

have
you
any

mildly

Your

over

I
try
to
tell
you
,
when
we
meet
today
,
something
that
have
be
in
my

since
Dora
die

<EOS>
You
remember

when
you
come
down

point
upward

<EOS>
She
only
shake
her
head
;
through
her
tear
I
see
the
same
sad
quiet
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
be
so
grateful
to
you
for
it

Agnes

so
bind
to

that

be
no

I
want
you

that
all
my

long
<EOS>
I
shall
look
up

<EOS>
She
put
her
hand
in
mine
,
and
tell
me
she
be
proud
of
me
,
and
of
what
I
say
;
although
I
praise
her
very
far
beyond
her
worth

<EOS>
then
she
go
on
softly
play
,

without
remove
her

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do

what
I
have

tonight

Agnes

say
I
,
"
strangely
seem
to
be
a
part
of
the
feeling
with
which
I
regard
you

see
you
first

which
I
sit

More
than
that
,
Agnes

I
know

almost
as
if
I
have
know
this
story

that
there
be
something
inexplicably
gentle

softened

surround
you

something
that
may
have
be
sorrowful
in
someone
else
(
as
I
can
now
understand
it
be

be
not

She
softly
play
on
,
look
at
me
still

Will
you

such
fancy

no

at
my

never

be

no

<EOS>
for
an
instant

a
distressful
shadow
cross
her
face
;
but
,
even
in
the
start
it
give
me
,
it
be
go
;
and
she
be
play
on
,
and
look
at
me
with
her
own
calm
smile

<EOS>
as
I
ride
back
in
the
lonely
night
,
the
wind
go
by
me
like
a
restless
memory
,
I
think
of
this
,
and
fear
she
be
not
happy
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
happy
;
but
,
thus
far
,
I
have
faithfully
set
the
seal
upon
the
past
,
and
,
think
of
her
,
point
upward
,
think
of
her
as
point
to
that
sky
above
me
,
where
,
in
the
mystery
to
come
,
I
may
yet
love
her
with
a
love
unknown
on
earth
,
and
tell
her
what
the
strife
have
be
within
me
when
I
love
her
here

Chapter
61
.
<EOS>
I
be
show
two
interesting
penitent
 
<EOS>
for
a
time
---
at
all
event
until
my
book
should
be
complete
,
which
would
be
the
work
of
several
month
---
I
take
up
my
abode
in
my
aunt
's
house
at
Dover
;
and
there
,
sit
in
the
window
from
which
I
have
look
out
at
the
moon
upon
the
sea
,
when
that
roof
first
give
me
shelter
,
I
quietly
pursue
my
task
.
   
<EOS>
in
pursuance
of
my
intention
of
refer
to
my
own
fiction
only
when
their
course
should
incidentally
connect
itself
with
the
progress
of
my
story
,
I
do
not
enter
on
the
aspiration
,
the
delight
,
anxiety
,
and
triumph
of
my
art
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
truly
devote
myself
to
it
with
my
strong
earnestness
,
and
bestow
upon
it
every
energy
of
my
soul
<EOS>
,
I
have
already
say
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
book
I
have
write
be
of
any
worth
,
they
will
supply
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
otherwise
have
write
to
poor
purpose
,
and
the
rest
will
be
of
interest
to
no
one
.
   
<EOS>
occasionally
,
I
go
to
London
;
to
lose
myself
in
the
swarm
of
life
there
,
or
to
consult
with
Traddles
on
some
business
point
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
manage
for
me
,
in
my
absence
,
with
the
soundest
judgement
;
and
my
worldly
affair
be
prosper
.
 
<EOS>
as
my
notoriety
begin
to
bring
upon
me
an
enormous
quantity
of
letter
from
people
of
whom
I
have
no
knowledge
---
chiefly
about
nothing
,
and
extremely
difficult
to
answer
---
I
agree
with
traddle
to
have
my
name
paint
up
on
his
door
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
the
devoted
postman
on
that
beat
deliver
bushel
of
letter
for
me
;
and
there
,
at
interval
,
I
labour
through
them
,
like
a
Home
Secretary
of
State
without
the
salary
.
   
<EOS>
among
this
correspondence
,
there
drop
in
,
every
now
and
then
,
an
obliging
proposal
from
one
of
the
numerous
outsider
always
lurk
about
the
Commons
,
to
practise
under
cover
of
my
name
(
if
I
would
take
the
necessary
step
remain
to
make
a
proctor
of
myself
)
,
and
pay
me
a
percentage
on
the
profit
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
decline
these
offer
;
be
already
aware
that
there
be
plenty
of
such
covert
practitioner
in
existence
,
and
consider
the
Commons
quite
bad
enough
,
without
my
do
anything
to
make
it
bad
.
   
<EOS>
the
girl
have
go
home
,
when
my
name
burst
into
bloom
on
Traddles
's
door
;
and
the
sharp
boy
look
,
all
day
,
as
if
he
have
never
hear
of
Sophy
,
shut
up
in
a
back
room
,
glance
down
from
her
work
into
a
sooty
little
strip
of
garden
with
a
pump
in
it
.
<EOS>
but
there
I
always
find
her
,
the
same
bright
housewife
;
often
hum
her
Devonshire
ballad
when
no
strange
foot
be
come
up
the
stair
,
and
blunt
the
sharp
boy
in
his
official
closet
with
melody
.
   
<EOS>
I
wonder
,
at
first
,
why
I
so
often
find
Sophy
write
in
a
copy
-
book
;
and
why
she
always
shut
it
up
when
I
appear
,
and
hurry
it
into
the
table
-
drawer
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
secret
soon
come
out
.
<EOS>
one
day
,
Traddles
(
who
have
just
come
home
through
the
drizzle
sleet
from
Court
)
take
a
paper
out
of
his
desk
,
and
ask
me
what
I
think
of
that
handwriting
?
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
don't
,
Tom
!
"
cry
Sophy
,
who
be
warm
his
slipper
before
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
return
Tom
,
in
a
delighted
state
,
"
why
not
?
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
say
to
that
writing
,
Copperfield
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
extraordinarily
legal
and
formal
,
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
I
ever
see
such
a
stiff
hand
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
not
like
a
lady
's
hand
,
be
it
?
"
say
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
"
a
lady
's
!
"
I
repeat
.
 
<EOS>
"
brick
and
mortar
be
more
like
a
lady
's
hand
!
"
   
<EOS>
traddle
break
into
a
rapturous
laugh
,
and
inform
me
that
it
be
Sophy
's
writing
;
that
Sophy
have
vow
and
declare
he
would
need
a
copying
-
clerk
soon
,
and
she
would
be
that
clerk
;
that
she
have
acquire
this
hand
from
a
pattern
;
and
that
she
could
throw
off
---
I
forget
how
many
folio
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Sophy
be
very
much
confuse
by
my
being
tell
all
this
,
and
say
that
when
"
Tom
"
be
make
a
judge
he
would
not
be
so
ready
to
proclaim
it
.
 
<EOS>
which
"
Tom
"
deny
;
aver
that
he
should
always
be
equally
proud
of
it
,
under
all
circumstance
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
a
thoroughly
good
and
charming
wife
she
be
,
my
dear
traddle
!
"
<EOS>

I
,
when
she
have
go
away
,
laugh
.

My

return
Traddles

without
any

the
way

indeed

you

I
return

You

I

I
be
sure
we
are
two

return
traddle

I
admit
that
,
at
all
event
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
my
soul
,
<EOS>
when
I
see
her
get
up
by
candle
-
light
on
these
dark
morning
,
busy
herself
in
the
day
's
arrangement
,
go
out
to
market
before
the
clerk
come
into
the
Inn
,
care
for
no
weather
,
devise
the
most
capital
little
dinner
out
of
the
plain
material
,
make
pudding
and
pie
,
keep
everything
in
its
right
place

always
so
neat
and
ornamental

sit
up
at
night
with
me
if
it
be
ever
so
late
,
sweet
-
tempered
and
encouraging
always
,
and
all
for

I
positively
sometimes
can
not

<EOS>
He
be
tender
of
the
very
slipper
she
have
be
warm
,
as
he
put
them
on
,
and
stretch
his
foot
enjoyingly
upon
the
fender
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
positively
sometimes
can
not
believe
it
,
"
say
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
our
pleasure
!
<EOS>
dear
me
,
they
be
inexpensive
,
but
they
be
quite
wonderful
!
<EOS>
when
we
be
at
home
here
,
of
an
evening
,
and
shut
the
outer
door
,
and
draw
those
curtain
---
which
she
make
---
where
could
we
be
more
snug
?
 
<EOS>
when
it
be
fine
,
and
we
go
out
for
a
walk
in
the
evening
,
the
street
abound
in
enjoyment
for
us
.
 
<EOS>
We
look
into
the
glitter
window
of
the
jeweller
'
shop
;
and
I
show
Sophy
which
of
the
diamond
-
eye
serpent
,
coil
up
on
white
satin
rise
ground
<EOS>
,
I
would
give
her
if
I
could
afford
it
;
and
Sophy
show
me
which
of
the
gold
watch
that
be
cap
and
jewel
and
engine
-
turn
,
and
possess
of
the
horizontal
lever
-
escape
-
movement
,
and
all
sort
of
thing
,
she
would
buy
for
me
if
she
could
afford
it
;
and
we
pick
out
the
spoon
and
fork
,
fish
-
slice
,
butter
-
knife
,
and
sugar
-
tong
,
we
should
both
prefer
if
we
could
both
afford
it
;
and
really
we
go
away
as
if
we
have
get
them
!
<EOS>
then
,
when
we
stroll
into
the
square
,
and
great
street
,
and
see
a
house
to
let
,
sometimes
we
look
up
at
it
,
and
say
,
how
would
that
do
,
if
I
be
make
a
judge
?
 
<EOS>
and
we
parcel
it
out
---
<EOS>
such
a
room
for
us
,
such
room
for
the
girl
,
and
so
forth
;
until
we
settle
to
our
satisfaction
that
it
would
do
,
or
it
would
not
do
,
as
the
case
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
we
go
at
half
-
price
to
the
pit
of
the
theatre
---
<EOS>
the
very
smell
of
which
be
cheap
,
in
my
opinion
,
at
the
money
---
and
there
we
thoroughly
enjoy
the
play
:
which
Sophy
believe
every
word
of
,
and
so
do
I.
 
<EOS>
in
walk
home
,
perhaps
we
buy
a
little
bit
of
something
at
a
cook's
-
shop
,
or
a
little
lobster
at
the
fishmonger
,
and
bring
it
here
,
and
make
a
splendid
supper
,
chat
about
what
we
have
see
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
you
know
,
Copperfield
,
if
I
be
Lord
Chancellor
,
we
could
not
do
this
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
would
do
something
,
whatever
you
be
,
my
dear
traddle
,
"
think
I
,
"
that
would
be
pleasant
and
amiable
.
 
<EOS>
and
by
the
way
,
"
I
say
aloud
,
"
I
suppose
you
never
draw
any
skeleton
now
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
really
,
"
reply
traddle
,
laughing
,
and
reddening
,
"
I
can
not
wholly
deny
that
I
do
,
my
dear
Copperfield
.
 
<EOS>
for
be
in
one
of
the
back
row
of
the
King
's
Bench
the
other
day
,
with
a
pen
in
my
hand
,
the
fancy
come
into
my
head
to
try
how
I
have
preserve
that
accomplishment
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
afraid
there
be
a
skeleton
---
in
a
wig
---
on
the
ledge
of
the
desk
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
after
we
have
both
laugh
heartily
,
Traddles
wind
up
by
look
with
a
smile
at
the
fire
,
and
say
,
in
his
forgiving
way
,
"
Old
Creakle
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
letter
from
that
old
---
<EOS>
rascal
here
,
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
for
I
never
be
less
disposed
to
forgive
him
the
way
he
use
to
batter
Traddles
,
than
when
I
see
Traddles
so
ready
to
forgive
him
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
from
Creakle
the
schoolmaster
?
<EOS>
"
exclaim
traddle
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
among
the
person
who
be
attract
to
me
in
my
rise
fame
and
fortune
,
"
say
I
,
look
over
my
letter
,
"
and
who
discover
that
they
be
always
much
attach
to
me
,
be
the
self
-
same
Creakle
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
schoolmaster
now
,
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
retire
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
Middlesex
Magistrate
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
think
traddle
may
be
surprised
to
hear
it
,
but
he
be
not
so
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
suppose
he
come
to
be
a
Middlesex
Magistrate
?
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
me
!
"
<EOS>
reply
traddle
,
"
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
answer
that
question
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
he
vote
for
somebody
,
or
lend
money
to
somebody
,
or
buy
something
of
somebody
,
or
otherwise
oblige
somebody
,
or
job

who
know
somebody
who
get
the
lieutenant
of
the
county

nominate
him
for
the
commission

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
on
the
commission
he
be
,
at
any
rate
,
"
say
I.
 
"
<EOS>
and
he
write
to
me
here
,
that
he
will
be
glad
to
show
me
,
in
operation
,
the
only
true
system
of
prison
discipline
;
the
only
unchallengeable
way
of
make
sincere
and
lasting
convert
and
penitent
---
which
,
you
know
,
be
by
solitary
confinement
.
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
to
the
system
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
traddle
,
look
grave
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
to
my
accept
the
offer

your
go
with
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
object
,
"
say
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
write
to
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
You
remember
(
to
say
nothing
of
our
treatment
)
this
same
Creakle
turn
his
son
out
of
door
,
I
suppose
,
and
the
life
he
use
to
lead
his
wife
and
daughter
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
perfectly
,
"
say
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yet
,
if
you
will
read
his
letter
,
you
will
find
he
be
the
tender
of
man
to
prisoner
convict
of
the
whole
calendar
of
felony
,
"
say
I
;
"
though
I
can
not
find
that
his
tenderness
extend
to
any
other
class
of
create
being
.
"
   
<EOS>
Traddles
shrug
his
shoulder
,
and
be
not
at
all
surprised
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
expect
him
to
be
,
and
be
not
surprise
myself
;
or
my
observation
of
similar
practical
satire
would
have
be
but
scanty
.
 
<EOS>
We
arrange
the
time
of
our
visit
,
and
I
write
accordingly
to
Mr
Creakle
that
evening
.
   
<EOS>
on
the
appoint
day
---
I
think
it
be
the
next
day
,
but
no
matter
---
Traddles
and
I
repair
to
the
prison
where
Mr
Creakle
be
powerful
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
immense
and
solid
building
,
erect
at
a
vast
expense
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
think
,
as
we
approach
the
gate
,
what
an
uproar
would
have
be
make
in
the
country
,
if
any
delude
man
have
propose
to
spend
one
half
the
money
it
have
cost
,
on
the
erection
of
an
industrial
school
for
the
young
,
or
a
house
of
refuge
for
the
deserve
old
.
   
<EOS>
in
an
office
that
may
have
be
on
the
ground
-
floor
of
the
Tower
of
Babel
,
it
be
so
massively
construct
,
we
be
present
to
our
old
schoolmaster
;
who
be
one
of
a
group
,
compose
of
two
or
three
of
the
busy
sort
of
magistrate
,
and
some
visitor
they
have
bring
.
 
<EOS>
He
receive
me
,
like
a
man
who
have
form
my
mind
in
bygone
year
,
and
have
always
love
me
tenderly
.
 
<EOS>
on
my
introduce
traddle
,
Mr
Creakle
express
,
in
like
manner
,
but
in
an
inferior
degree
,
that
he
have
always
be
Traddles
's
guide
,
philosopher
,
and
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Our
venerable
instructor
be
a
great
deal
old
,
and
not
improve
in
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
be
as
fiery
as
ever
;
his
eye
be
as
small
,
and
rather
deep
set
.
 
<EOS>
the
scanty
,
wet
-
looking
grey
hair
,
by
which
I
remember
him
,
be
almost
go
;
and
the
thick
vein
in
his
bald
head
be
none
the
more
agreeable
to
look
at
.
   
<EOS>
after
some
conversation
among
these
gentleman
,
from
which
I
may
have
suppose
that
there
be
nothing
in
the
world
to
be
legitimately
take
into
account
but
the
supreme
comfort
of
prisoner
,
at
any
expense
,
and
nothing
on
the
wide
earth
to
be
do
outside
prison
-
door
,
we
begin
our
inspection
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
then
just
dinner
-
time
,
we
go
,
first
into
the
great
kitchen
,
where
every
prisoner
's
dinner
be
in
course
of
be
set
out
separately
(
to
be
hand
to
him
in
his
cell
)
,
with
the
regularity
and
precision
of
clock
-
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
aside
,
to
Traddles
,
that
I
wonder
whether
it
occur
to
anybody
,
that
there
be
a
striking
contrast
between
these
plentiful
repast
of
choice
quality
,
and
the
dinner
,
not
to
say
of
pauper
,
but
of
soldier
,
sailor
,
labourer
,
the
great
bulk
of
the
honest
,
work
community
;
of
whom
not
one
man
in
five
hundred
<EOS>
ever
dine
half
so
well
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
learn
that
the
"
system
"
require
high
living
;
and
,
in
short
,
to
dispose
of
the
system
,
once
for
all
,
I
find
that
on
that
head
and
on
all
other
,
"
the
system
"
put
an
end
to
all
doubt
,
and
dispose
of
all
anomaly
.
 
<EOS>
nobody
appear
to
have
the
least
idea
that
there
be
any
other
system
,
but
the
system
,
to
be
consider
.
   
<EOS>
as
we
be
go
through
some
of
the
magnificent
passage
,
I
inquire
of
Mr
Creakle
and
his
friend
what
be
suppose
to
be
the
main
advantage
of
this
all
-
governing
and
universally
over
-
ride
system
?
 
<EOS>
I
find
them
to
be
the
perfect
isolation
of
prisoner
---
so
that
no
one
man
in
confinement
there
,
know
anything
about
another
;
and
the
reduction
of
prisoner
to
a
wholesome
state
of
mind
,
lead
to
sincere
contrition
and
repentance
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
it
strike
me
,
when
we
begin
to
visit
individual
in
their
cell
,
and
to
traverse
the
passage
in
which
those
cell
be
,
and
to
have
the
manner
of
the
go
to
chapel
and
so
forth
,
explain
to
us
,
that
there
be
a
strong
probability
of
the
prisoner
know
a
good
deal
about
each
other
,
and
of
their
carrying
on
a
pretty
complete
system
of
intercourse
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
at
the
time
I
write
,
have
be
prove
,
I
believe
,
to
be
the
case
;
but
,
as
it
would
have
be
flat
blasphemy
against
the
system
to
have
hint
such
a
doubt
then
,
I
look
out
for
the
penitence
as
diligently
as
I
could
.
   
<EOS>
and
here
again
,
I
have
great
misgiving
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
as
prevalent
a
fashion
in
the
form
of
the
penitence
,
as
I
have
leave
outside
in
the
form
of
the
coat
and
waistcoat
in
the
window
of
the
tailor
'
shop
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
a
vast
amount
of
profession
,
vary
very
little
in
character
:
vary
very
little
(
which
I
think
exceedingly
suspicious
)
,
even
in
word
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
a
great
many
fox
,
disparage
whole
vineyard
of
inaccessible
grape
;
but
I
find
very
few
fox
whom
I
would
have
trust
within
reach
of
a
bunch
.
<EOS>
above
all
,
I
find
that
the
most
professing
man
be
the
great
object
of
interest
;
and
that
their
conceit
,
their
vanity
,
their
want
of
excitement
,
and
their
love
of
deception
(
which
many
of
them
possess
to
an
almost
incredible
extent
,
as
their
history
show
)
,
all
prompt
to
these
profession
,
and
be
all
gratify
by
them
.
   
<EOS>
however
,
I
hear
so
repeatedly
,
in
the
course
of
our
going
to
and
fro
,
of
a
certain
Number
Twenty
Seven
,
who
be
the
Favourite
,
and
who
really
appear
to
be
a
Model
Prisoner
,
that
I
resolve
to
suspend
my
judgement
until
I
should
see
Twenty
Seven
.
 
<EOS>
Twenty
Eight
,
I
understand
,
be
also
a
bright
particular
star
;
but
it
be
his
misfortune
to
have
his
glory
a
little
dim
by
the
extraordinary
lustre
of
Twenty
Seven
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
so
much
of
Twenty
Seven
,
of
his
pious
admonition
to
everybody
around
him
,
and
of
the
beautiful
letter
he
constantly
write
to
his
mother
(
whom
he
seem
to
consider
in
a
very
bad
way
)
,
that
I
become
quite
impatient
to
see
him
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
to
restrain
my
impatience
for
some
time
,
on
account
of
Twenty
Seven
be
reserve
for
a
conclude
effect
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
at
last
,
we
come
to
the
door
of
his
cell
;
and
Mr
Creakle
,
look
through
a
little
hole
in
it
,
report
to
us
,
in
a
state
of
the
great
admiration
,
that
he
be
read
a
Hymn
Book
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
such
a
rush
of
head
immediately
,
to
see
Number
Twenty
Seven
read
his
Hymn
Book
,
that
the
little
hole
be
block
up
,
six
or
seven
head
deep
.
 
<EOS>
to
remedy
this
inconvenience
,
and
give
us
an
opportunity
of
converse
with
Twenty
Seven
in
all
his
purity
,
Mr
Creakle
direct
the
door
of
the
cell
to
be
unlocked
,
and
Twenty
Seven
to
be
invite
out
into
the
passage
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
do
;
and
whom
should
Traddles
and
I
then
behold
,
to
our
amazement
,
in
this
convert
Number
Twenty
Seven
,
but
Uriah
Heep
!
   
<EOS>
He
know
us
directly
;
and
say
,
as
he
come
out
---
with
the
old
writhe
,
---
   
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
do
,
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
?
 
<EOS>
how
do
you
do
,
Mr
Traddles
?
"
   
<EOS>
this
recognition
cause
a
general
admiration
in
the
party
.
 
<EOS>
I
rather
think
that
everyone
be
strike
by
his
not
be
proud
,
and
take
notice
of
us
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
Twenty
Seven
,
"
say
Mr
Creakle
,
mournfully
admire
him
.
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
find
yourself
today
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
umble
,
sir
!
"
reply
Uriah
Heep
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
always
so
,
Twenty
Seven
,
"
say
Mr
Creakle
.
   
<EOS>
here
,
another
gentleman
ask
,
with
extreme
anxiety
:
"
be
you
quite
comfortable
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
I
thank
you
,
sir
!
"
say
Uriah
Heep
,
look
in
that
direction
.
 
<EOS>
"
far
more
comfortable
here
,
than
ever
I
be
outside
.
<EOS>
I
see
my
folly
,
now
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
what
make
me
comfortable
.
"
   
<EOS>
several
gentleman
be
much
affected
;
and
a
third
questioner
,
force
himself
to
the
front
,
inquire
with
extreme
feeling
:
"
how
do
you
find
the
beef
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
sir
,
"
reply
Uriah
,
glance
in
the
new
direction
of
this
voice
,
"
it
be
tough
yesterday
than
I
could
wish
;
but
it
be
my
duty
to
bear
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
commit
folly
,
gentleman
,
"
say
Uriah
,
look
round
with
a
meek
smile
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
ought
to
bear
the
consequence
without
repine
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
murmur
,
partly
of
gratification
at
Twenty
Seven
's
celestial
state
of
mind
,
and
partly
of
indignation
against
the
Contractor
who
have
give
him
any
cause
of
complaint
(
a
note
of
which
be
immediately
make
by
Mr
Creakle
)
,
have
subside
,
Twenty
Seven
stand
in
the
midst
of
us
,
as
if
he
feel
himself
the
principal
object
of
merit
in
a
highly
meritorious
museum
.
 
<EOS>
that
we
,
the
neophytes
,
may
have
an
excess
of
light
shine
upon
us
all
at
once
,
order
be
give
to
let
out
twenty
eight
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
be
so
much
astonished
already
,
that
I
only
feel
a
kind
of
resign
wonder
when
Mr
Littimer
walk
forth
,
read
a
good
book
!
   
<EOS>
"
Twenty
eight

a
gentleman
in
spectacle
,
who
have
not
yet

"

you

Dora
<EOS>
,
what
I
could
have
wish
my
wife
to
be
.
   
<EOS>
My
duty
to
Agnes
,
who
love
me
with
a
love
,
which
,
if
I
disquiet
,
I
wrong
most
selfishly
and
poorly
,
and
could
never
restore
;
my
mature
assurance
that
I
,
who
have
work
out
my
own
destiny
,
and
win
what
I
have
impetuously
set
my
heart
on
,
have
no
right
to
murmur
,
and
must
bear
;
comprise
what
I
feel
and
what
I
have
learn
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
love
her
:
and
now
it
even
become
some
consolation
to
me
,
vaguely
to
conceive
a
distant
day
when
I
may
blamelessly
avow
it
;
when
all
this
should
be
over
;
when
I
could
say
"
agne
,
so
it
be
when
I
come
home
;
and
now
I
be
old
,
and
I
never
have
love
since
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
do
not
once
show
me
any
change
in
herself
.
 
<EOS>
what
she
always
have
be
to
me
,
she
still
be
;
wholly
unaltered
.
   
<EOS>
between
my
aunt
and
me
there
have
be
something
,
in
this
connexion
,
since
the
night
of
my
return
,
which
I
can
not
call
a
restraint
,
or
an
avoidance
of
the
subject
,
so
much
as
an
imply
understanding
that
we
think
of
it
together
,
but
do
not
shape
our
thought
into
word
.
 
<EOS>
when
,
accord
to
our
old
custom
,
we
sit
before
the
fire
at
night
,
we
often
fall
into
this
train
;
as
naturally
,
and
as
consciously
to
each
other
,
as
if
we
have
unreservedly
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
preserve
an
unbroken
silence
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
that
she
have
read
,
or
partly
read
,
my
thought
that
night
;
and
that
she
fully
comprehend
why
I
give
mine
no
more
distinct
expression
.
   
<EOS>
this
Christmas
-
time
be
come
,
and
agne
have
repose
no
new
confidence
in
me
,
a
doubt
that
have
several
time
arise
in
my
mind
---
whether
she
could
have
that
perception
of
the
true
state
of
my
breast
,
which
restrain
her
with
the
apprehension
of
give
me
pain
---
begin
to
oppress
me
heavily
.
 
<EOS>
if
that
be
so
,
my
sacrifice
be
nothing
;
my
plain
obligation
to
her
unfulfilled
;
and
every
poor
action
I
have
shrink
from
,
I
be
hourly
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
resolve
to
set
this
right
beyond
all
doubt
;
---
if
such
a
barrier
be
between
us
,
to
break
it
down
at
once
with
a
determined
hand
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
---
what
last
reason
have
I
to
remember
it
!
---
<EOS>
a
cold
,
harsh
,
winter
day
.
 
<EOS>
there
have
be
snow
,
some
hour
before
;
and
it
lie
,
not
deep
,
but
hard
-
frozen
on
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
out
at
sea
,
beyond
my
window
,
the
wind
blow
ruggedly
from
the
north
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
think
of
it
,
sweep
over
those
mountain
waste
of
snow
in
Switzerland
,
then
inaccessible
to
any
human
foot
;
and
have
be
speculate
which
be
the
lonely
,
those
solitary
region
,
or
a
deserted
ocean
.
   
<EOS>
"

my

<EOS>
My

not

composedly
before
her

she
have
pat
me
on
the
shoulder
,
and
sit
down
in
my
chair

"
of
that
attachment
of
agne

<EOS>
She
look
up
in
my
face
a
little
while
,
before
reply
:

She
look
so
steadfastly
at
me
:
with
a
kind
of
doubt
,
or
pity
,
or
suspense
in
her
affection
:
<EOS>
that
I
summon
the
strong
determination
to
show
her
a
perfectly
cheerful
face

more

I
echo
it

part
from
my
aunt
,
and
go
lightly
downstairs
,
mount
,
and
ride
away
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
great
reason
than
before
to
do
what
I
have
resolve
to
do
.
   
<EOS>
how
well
I
recollect
the
wintry
ride
!
<EOS>
the
frozen
particle
of
ice
,
brush
from
the
blade
of
grass
by
the
wind
,
and
borne
across
my
face
;
the
hard
clatter
of
the
horse
's
hoofs
,
beat
a
tune
upon
the
ground
;
the
stiff
-
till
soil
;
the
snowdrift
,
lightly
eddy
in
the
chalk
-
pit
as
the
breeze
ruffle
it
;
the
smoking
team
with
the
waggon
of
old
hay
,
stop
to
breathe
on
the
hill
-
top
,
and
shake
their
bell
musically
;
the
whitened
slope
and
sweep
of
down
-
land
lie
against
the
dark
sky
,
as
if
they
be
draw
on
a
huge
slate
!
   
<EOS>
I
find
Agnes
alone
.
 
<EOS>
the
little
girl
have
go
to
their
own
home
now
,
and
she
be
alone
by
the
fire
,
read
.
 
<EOS>
She
put
down
her
book
on
see
me
come
in
;
and
have
welcome
me
as
usual
,
take
her
work
-
basket
and
sit
in
one
of
the
old
-
fashioned
window
.
   
<EOS>
I
sit
beside
her
on
the
window
-
seat
,
and
we
talk
of
what
I
be
do
,
and
when
it
would
be
do
,
and
of
the
progress
I
have
make
since
my
last
visit
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
be
very
cheerful
;
and
laughingly
predict
that
I
should
soon
become
too
famous
to
be
talk
to
,
on
such
subject
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
I
make
the
most
of
the
present
time
,
you
see
,
"
say
agne
,
"
and
talk
to
you
while
I
may
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
as
I
look
at
her
beautiful
face
,
observant
of
her
work
,
she
raise
her
mild
clear
eye
,
and
see
that
I
be
look
at
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
thoughtful
today

Trotwood
!
"
   
<EOS>

shall
I
tell
you
what
about
?
 
<EOS>
I
come
to
tell
you

"
   
<EOS>
She
put
aside
her
work
,
as
she
be
use
to
do
when
we
be
seriously
discuss
anything
;
and
give
me
her
whole
attention

My

<EOS>
"
no

she
answer
,
with
a
look

astonishment

I
always
have

<EOS>
"
no

she
answer
,
as
before

<EOS>
"
do
you
remember

owe
you

and
how
fervently
I
feel
towards

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
remember
it

"
she

,
gently
,
"
very
well

"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
secret

I.

me
share
it

Agnes

<EOS>
She
cast
down
her
eye
,
and
tremble
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
hardly
fail
to
know
,
even
if
I
have
not
hear
---
but
from
other
lip
than
your
,
Agnes
,
which
seem
strange
---
that
there
be
someone
upon
whom
you
have
bestow
the
treasure
of
your
love
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
shut
me
out
of
what
concern
your
happiness
so
nearly

<EOS>
if
you
can
trust
me
,
as
you
say
you
can

as
I
know
you
may

me
be
your
friend

your
brother

in
this
matter

of
all
other

"
   
<EOS>
with
an
appealing
,
almost
a
reproachful
,
glance
,
she
rise
from
the
window
;
and
hurry
across
the
room
as
if
without
know
where
,
put
her
hand
before
her
face
,
and
burst
into
such
tear
as
smote
me
to
the
heart
.
   
<EOS>
and
yet
they
awaken
something
in
me
,
bring
promise
to
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
without
my
knowing
why
,
these
tear
ally
themselves
with
the
quietly
sad
smile
which
be
so
fix
in
my
remembrance
,
and
shake
me
more
with
hope
than
fear
or
sorrow
.

I
have
speak
to
her
on
that
former
night
,
of
her
affection

Her

I

I

she

She
lay

Our

be
not

the
trial
(
her
so
much
the
great

through
which
we

for

We
walk
,
that
winter
evening

in

field
together

the

calm

partake

We
stand
together
in

fashioned
window
at
night

when
the

Agnes
with

quiet
eye
raise

<EOS>
long
mile
of
road
then
open
out
before
my
mind
;
and
,
toil
on
,
I
see
a
ragged
way
-
wear
boy
,
forsake
and
neglect
,
who
should
come
to
call
even
the
heart
now
beat
against
mine

his

<EOS>
It
be
nearly
dinner

She

We
find
her
,
in

sit
by
the
fire

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
She
dart
a
hopeful
glance
at
me
,
when
I
say
"

;
but
see
that
I
look
as

she
take
off
her

in
despair

and
rub
her
nose
with
them

<EOS>
She
greet
Agnes
heartily

we
be
soon
in

at

My

put
on

twice

thrice
,
to
take
another
look

as
often
take
them
off
again
,
disappoint
,
and
rub
her
nose
with
them

<EOS>
much
to
the
discomfiture

I

annoyance
short

<EOS>
I
take
agne
in

then

<EOS>
I
find
,
on
glance
at
the
remain
content
of
the
newspaper
,
that
Mr
Micawber
be
a
diligent
and
esteemed
correspondent
of
that
journal
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
another
letter
from
him
in
the
same
paper
,
touch
a
bridge
;
there
be
an
advertisement
of
a
collection
of
similar
letter
by
him
,
to
be
shortly
republish
,
in
a
neat
volume
,
"
with
considerable
addition
"
;
and
,
unless
I
be
very
much
mistaken
,
the
Leading
Article
be
his
also
.
   
<EOS>
We
talk
much
of
Mr
Micawber
,
on
many
other
evening
while
Mr
Peggotty
remain
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
He
live
with
us
during
the
whole
term
of
his
stay
,
---
which
,
I
think
,
be
something
less
than
a
month
,
---
and
his
sister
and
my
aunt
come
to
London
to
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
and
I
part
from
him
aboard

ship
,
when
he
sail
;

we
shall
never

from
him
more
,
on

<EOS>
but
before
he
leave
,
he
go
with
me
to
Yarmouth
,
to
see
a
little
tablet
I
have
put
up
in
the
churchyard
to
the
memory
of
Ham
.
 
<EOS>
while
I
be
copy
the
plain
inscription
for
him
at
his
request
,
I
see
him
stoop
,
and
gather
a
tuft
of
grass
from
the
grave

a
little
earth

<EOS>
a
last
retrospect
 
<EOS>
and
now
my
write
story
end
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
back
,
once
more
---
for
the
last
time
---
before
I
close
these
leave
.
   
<EOS>
I
see
myself
,
with
agne
at
my
side
,
journey
along
the
road
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
our
child
and
our
friend
around
us
;
and
I
hear
the
roar
of
many
voice
,
not
indifferent
to
me
as
I
travel
on
.
   
<EOS>
what
face
be
the
most
distinct
to
me
in
the
fleeting
crowd
?
 
<EOS>
Lo
,
these
;
all
turn
to
me
as
I
ask
my
thought
the
question
!
   
<EOS>
here
be
my
aunt
,
in
strong
spectacle
,
an
old
woman
of
four
-
score
year
and
more
,
but
upright
yet
,
and
a
steady
walker
of
six
mile
at
a
stretch
in
winter
weather
.
   
<EOS>
always
with
her
,
here
come
Peggotty
,
my
good
old
nurse
,
likewise
in
spectacle
,
accustomed
to
do
needle
-
work
at
night
very
close
to
the
lamp
,
but
never
sit
down
to
it
without
a
bit
of
wax
candle
,
a
yard
-
measure
in
a
little
house
,
and
a
work
-
box
with
a
picture
of
St
Paul
's
upon
the
lid
.
   
<EOS>
the
cheek
and
arm
of
Peggotty
,
so
hard
and
red
in
my
childish
day
,
when
I
wonder
why
the
bird
do
not
peck
her
in
preference
to
apple
,
be
shrivel
now
;
and
her
eye
,
that
use
to
darken
their
whole
neighbourhood
in
her
face
,
be
fainter
(
though
they
glitter
still
)
;
but
her
rough
forefinger
,
which
I
once
associate
with
a
pocket
nutmeg
-
grater
,
be
just
the
same
,
and
when
I
see
my
least
child
catching
at
it
as
it
totter
from
my
aunt
to
her
,
I
think
of
our
little
parlour
at
home
,
when
I
could
scarcely
walk
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
's
old
disappointment
be
set
right
,
now
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
godmother
to
a
real
living
Betsey
Trotwood
;
and
Dora
(
the
next
in
order
)
say
she
spoil
her
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
something
bulky
in
Peggotty
's
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
nothing
small
than
the
Crocodile
Book
,
which
be
in
rather
a
dilapidated
condition
by
this
time
,
with
diver
of
the
leave
tear
and
stitch
across
,
but
which
Peggotty
exhibit
to
the
child
as
a
precious
relic
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
it
very
curious
to
see
my
own
infant
face
,
look
up
at
me
from
the
Crocodile
story
;
and
to
be
remind
by
it
of
my
old
acquaintance
Brooks
of
Sheffield
.
   
<EOS>
among
my
boy
,
this
summer
holiday
time
,
I
see
an
old
man
make
giant
kite
,
and
gaze
at
them
in
the
air
,
with
a
delight
for
which
there
be
no
word
.
 
<EOS>
He
greet
me
rapturously
,
and
whisper
,
with
many
nod
and
wink
,
"
Trotwood
,
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
I
shall
finish
the
Memorial
when
I
have
nothing
else
to
do
,
and
that
your
aunt
be
the
most
extraordinary
woman
in
the
world
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
who
be
this
bent
lady
,
support
herself
by
a
stick
,
and
show
me
a
countenance
in
which
there
be
some
trace
of
old
pride
and
beauty
,
feebly
contend
with
a
querulous
,
imbecile
,
fretful
wandering
of
the
mind
?
 
<EOS>
She
be
in
a
garden
;
and
near
her
stand
a
sharp
,
dark
,
withered
woman
,
with
a
white
scar
on
her
lip
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
hear
what
they
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
Rosa
,
I
have
forget
this
gentleman
's
name
.
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
bend
over
her
,
and
call
to
her
,
"
Mr
Copperfield
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
to
see
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
to
observe
you
<EOS>
be
in
mourning
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Time
will
be
good
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Her
impatient
attendant
scold
her
,
tell
her
I
be
not
in
mourning
,
bid
her
look
again
,
try
to
rouse
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
see
my
son
,
sir
,
"
say
the
eld
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
you
reconcile
?
"
   
<EOS>
look
fixedly
at
me
,
she
put
her
hand
to
her
forehead
,
and
moan
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
,
she
cry
,
in
a
terrible
voice
,
"
Rosa
,
come
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
dead
!
"
<EOS>
Rosa
kneel
at
her
foot
,
by
turn
caress
her
,
and
quarrel
with
her
;
now
fiercely
tell
her
,
"
I
love
him
better
than
you
ever
do
!
"
---
now
soothe
her
to
sleep
on
her
breast
,
like
a
sick
child
.
 
<EOS>
thus
I
leave
them
;
thus
I
always
find
them
;
thus
they
wear
their
time
away
,
from
year
to
year
.
   
<EOS>
what
ship
come
sailing
home
from
India
,
and
what
English
lady
be
this
,
marry
to
a
growl
old
Scotch
Croesus
with
great
flap
of
ear
?
 
<EOS>
Can
this
be
Julia
Mills
?
   
<EOS>
indeed
it
be
Julia
Mills
,
peevish
and
fine
,
with
a
black
man
to
carry
card
and
letter
to
her
on
a
golden
salver
,
and
a
copper
-
colour
woman
in
linen
,
with
a
bright
handkerchief
round
her
head
,
to
serve
her
Tiffin
in
her
dressing
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
but
Julia
keep
no
diary
in
these
day
;
never
sing
Affection
's
Dirge
;
eternally
quarrel
with
the
old
Scotch
Croesus
,
who
be
a
sort
of
yellow
bear
with
a
tan
hide
.
 
<EOS>
Julia
be
steep
in
money
to
the
throat
,
and
talk
and
think
of
nothing
else
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
her
better
in
the
Desert
of
Sahara
.
   
<EOS>
or
perhaps
this
be
the
Desert
of
Sahara
!
<EOS>
for
,
though
Julia
have
a
stately
house
,
and
mighty
company
,
and
sumptuous
dinner
every
day
,
I
see
no
green
growth
near
her
;
nothing
that
can
ever
come
to
fruit
or
flower
.
 
<EOS>
what
Julia
call
"
society
"
,
I
see
;
among
it
<EOS>
Mr
Jack
Maldon
,
from
his
Patent
Place
,
sneer
at
the
hand
that
give
it
him
,
and
speak
to
me
of
the
Doctor
as
"
so
charmingly
antique
"
.
<EOS>
but
when
society
be
the
name
for
such
hollow
gentleman
and
lady
,
Julia
,
and
when
its
breeding
be
profess
indifference
to
everything
that
can
advance
or
can
retard
mankind
,
I
think
we
must
have
lose
ourselves
in
that
same
Desert
of
Sahara
,
and
have
better
find
the
way
out
.
   
<EOS>
and
lo
,
the
Doctor
,
always
our
good
friend
,
labour
at
his
Dictionary
(
somewhere
about
the
letter
D^
)
,
and
happy
in
his
home
and
wife
.
 
<EOS>
also
the
Old
Soldier
,
on
a
considerably
reduce
footing
,
and
by
no
means
so
influential
as
in
day
of
yore
!
   
<EOS>
work
at
his
chamber
in
the
Temple
,
with
a
busy
aspect
,
and
his
hair
(
where
he
be
not
bald
)
make
more
rebellious
than
ever
by
the
constant
friction
of
his
lawyer's
-
wig
<EOS>
,
I
come
,
in
a
later
time
,
upon
my
dear
old
traddle
.
 
<EOS>
His
table
be
cover
with
thick
pile
of
paper
;
and
I
say
,
as
I
look
around
me
:
   
<EOS>
"
if
Sophy
be
your
clerk
,
now
,
Traddles
,
she
would
have
enough
to
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
say
that
,
my
dear
Copperfield
!
<EOS>
but
those
be
capital
day
,
too
,
in
Holborn
Court
!
<EOS>
be
they
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
when
she
tell
you
you
would
be
a
judge
?
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
the
town
talk
then
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
at
all
event
,
"
say
Traddles
,
"
if
I
ever
be
one

"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
know
you
will
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
when
I
be
one
,
I
shall
tell
the
story

as
I
say
I
would

"
   
<EOS>
We
walk
away
,
arm
in
arm
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
have
a
family
dinner
with
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Sophy
's
birthday
;
and
,
on
our
road
,
Traddles
discourse
to
me
of
the
good
fortune
he
have
enjoy
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
really
have
be
able
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
to
do
all
that
I
have
most
at
heart

<EOS>
there
be

the
Beauty

Traddles

<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
It
be
very
unfortunate
that
she
should
marry
such
a
vagabond

there
be
a
certain
dash
and
glare
about
him
that
catch
her

<EOS>
however

now
we
have
get
her
safe
at

get
rid

up
again

Traddles
's
house
be

of
the
very
house

it
easily
may
have
be
---
which
he
and
Sophy
use
to
parcel
out
,
in
their
evening
walk

<EOS>
It
be
a
large
house
;

Traddles
keep
his
paper
in

his
boot

themselves
into

good
bedroom

Beauty

be
engage
to
the
cousin
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
,
exactly
the
same
simple
,
unaffected
fellow
as
he
ever
be
,
sit
at
the
foot
of
the
large
table
like
a
patriarch
;
and
Sophy
beam
upon
him
,
from
the
head
,
across
a
cheerful
space
that
be
certainly
not
glitter
with
Britannia
metal
.
   
<EOS>
and
now
,
as
I
close
my
task
,
subdue
my
desire
to
linger
yet
,
these
face
fade
away
.
 
<EOS>
but
one
face
,
shine
on
me
like
a
heavenly
light
by
which
I
see
all
other
object
,
be
above
them
and
beyond
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
and
that
remain
.
   
<EOS>
I
turn
my
head
,
and
see
it
,
in
its
beautiful
serenity
,
beside
me
.
   
<EOS>
My
lamp
burn
low
,
and
I
have
write
far
into
the
night
;
but
the
dear
presence
,
without
which
I
be
nothing
,
bear
me
company
.
   
<EOS>
o
Agnes
,
o
my
soul
,
so
may
thy
face
be
by
me
when
I
close
my
life
indeed
;
<EOS>
so
may
I
,
when
reality
be
melt
from
me
,
like
the
shadow
which
I
now
dismiss
,
still
find
thee
near
me
,
point
upward
!
    
<EOS>
