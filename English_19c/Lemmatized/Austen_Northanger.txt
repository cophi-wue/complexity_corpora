no
one
who
have
ever
see
Catherine
Morland
in
her
infancy
would
have
suppose
her
bear
to
be
an
heroine
.
<EOS>
Her
situation
in
life
,
the
character
of
her
father
and
mother
,
her
own
person
and
disposition
,
be
all
equally
against
her
.
<EOS>
Her
father
be
a
clergyman
,
without
be
neglect
,
or
poor
,
and
a
very
respectable
man
,
though
his
name
be
Richard
 
<EOS>
and
he
have
never
be
handsome
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
considerable
independence
besides
two
good
living
 
and
he
be
not
in
the
least
addicted
to
lock
up
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
be
a
woman
of
useful
plain
sense
,
with
a
good
temper
,
and
,
what
be
more
remarkable
,
with
a
good
constitution
.
<EOS>
She
have
three
son
before
Catherine
be
bear
;
and
instead
of
die
in
bring
the
latter
into
the
world
,
as
anybody
may
expect
,
she
still
live
on
 
live
to
have
six
child
more
 
to
see
them
grow
up
around
her
,
and
to
enjoy
excellent
health
herself
.
<EOS>
a
family
of
ten
child
will
be
always
call
a
fine
family
,
where
there
be
head
and
arm
and
leg
enough
for
the
number
;
but
the
Morlands
have
little
other
right
to
the
word
,
for
they
be
in
general
very
plain
,
and
Catherine
,
for
many
year
of
her
life
,
as
plain
as
any
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
thin
awkward
figure
,
<EOS>
a
sallow
skin
without
colour
,
dark
lank
hair
,
and
strong
feature
 
so
much
for
her
person
;
and
not
less
unpropitious
for
heroism
seem
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
be
fond
of
all
boy
's
play
,
and
greatly
prefer
cricket
not
merely
to
doll
,
but
to
the
more
heroic
enjoyment
of
infancy
,
nurse
a
dormouse
,
feed
a
canary
-
bird
,
or
water
a
rose
-
bush
.
<EOS>
indeed
she
have
no
taste
for
a
garden
;
and
if
she
gather
flower
at
all
,
it
be
chiefly
for
the
pleasure
of
mischief
 
<EOS>
at
least
so
it
be
conjecture
from
her
always
prefer
those
which
she
be
forbid
to
take
.
<EOS>
such
be
her
propensity
 
<EOS>
her
ability
be
quite
as
extraordinary
.
<EOS>
She
never
could
learn
or
understand
anything
before
she
be
teach
;
and
sometimes
not
even
then
,
for
she
be
often
inattentive
,
and
occasionally
stupid
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
be
three
month
in
teach
her
only
to
repeat
the
"
Beggar
's
petition
"
;
and
after
all
,
her
next
sister
,
Sally
,
could
say
it
better
than
she
do
.
<EOS>
not
that
Catherine
be
always
stupid
 
by
no
mean
;
she
learn
the
fable
of
"
the
Hare
and
many
Friends
"
as
quickly
as
any
girl
in
England
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
wish
her
to
learn
music
;
and
Catherine
be
sure
she
should
like
it
,
for
she
be
very
fond
of
tinkle
the
key
of
the
old
forlorn
spinnet
;
so
,
at
eight
year
old
she
begin
.
<EOS>
She
learn
a
year
,
and
could
not
bear
it
;
and
Mrs.
Morland
,
who
do
not
insist
on
her
daughter
be
accomplish
in
spite
of
incapacity
or
distaste
,
allow
her
to
leave
off
.
<EOS>
the
day
which
dismiss
the
music
-
master
be
one
of
the
happy
of
Catherine
's
life
.
<EOS>
Her
taste
for
drawing
be
not
superior
;
though
whenever
she
could
obtain
the
outside
of
a
letter
from
her
mother
or
seize
upon
any
other
odd
piece
of
paper
,
she
do
what
she
could
in
that
way
,
by
draw
house
and
tree
,
hen
and
chicken
,
all
very
much
like
one
another
.
<EOS>
writing
and
account
<EOS>
she
be
teach
by
her
father
;
French
by
her
mother
:
her
proficiency
in
either
be
not
remarkable
,
and
she
shirk
her
lesson
in
both
whenever
she
could
.
<EOS>
what
a
strange
,
unaccountable
character
!
 
<EOS>
for
with
all
these
symptom
of
profligacy
<EOS>
at
ten
year
old
,
she
have
neither
a
bad
heart
nor
a
bad
temper
,
be
seldom
stubborn
,
scarcely
ever
quarrelsome
,
and
very
kind
to
the
little
one
,
with
few
interruption
of
tyranny
;
she
be
moreover
noisy
and
wild
,
hate
confinement
and
cleanliness
,
and
love
nothing
so
well
in
the
world
as
roll
down
the
green
slope
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
Catherine
Morland
at
ten
.
<EOS>
at
fifteen
,
appearance
be
mend
;
she
begin
to
curl
her
hair
and
long
for
ball
;
her
complexion
improve
,
her
feature
be
soften
by
plumpness
and
colour
,
her
eye
gain
more
animation
,
and
her
figure
more
consequence
.
<EOS>
Her
love
of
dirt
give
way
to
an
inclination
for
finery
,
and
she
grow
clean
as
she
grow
smart
;
she
have
now
the
pleasure
of
sometimes
hear
her
father
and
mother
remark
on
her
personal
improvement
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Catherine
grow
quite
a
good
-
looking
girl
 
<EOS>
she
be
almost
pretty
today
,
"
be
word
which
catch
her
ear
now
and
then
;
and
how
welcome
be
the
sound
!
<EOS>
to
look
almost
pretty
be
an
acquisition
of
high
delight
to
a
girl
who
have
be
look
plain
the
first
fifteen
year
of
her
life
than
a
beauty
from
her
cradle
can
ever
receive
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Morland
be
a
very
good
woman
,
and
wish
to
see
her
child
everything
they
ought
to
be
;
but
her
time
be
so
much
occupy
in
lying
-
in
and
teach
the
little
one
,
that
her
eld
daughter
be
inevitably
leave
to
shift
for
themselves
;
and
it
be
not
very
wonderful
that
Catherine
,
who
have
by
nature
nothing
heroic
about
her
,
should
prefer
cricket
,
baseball
,
ride
on
horseback
,
and
run
about
the
country
at
the
age
of
fourteen
,
to
book
 
or
at
least
book
of
information
 
for
,
<EOS>
provide
that
nothing
like
useful
knowledge
could
be
gain
from
them
,
provide
they
be
all
story
and
no
reflection
,
she
have
never
any
objection
to
book
at
all
.
<EOS>
but
from
fifteen
to
seventeen
she
be
in
training
for
a
heroine
;
she
read
all
such
work
as
heroine
must
read
to
supply
their
memory
with
those
quotation
which
be
so
serviceable
and
so
soothing
in
the
vicissitude
of
their
eventful
life
.
  
<EOS>
from
Pope
,
she
learn
to
censure
those
who
  
"
bear
about
the
mockery
of
woe
.
"
  
<EOS>
from
Gray
,
that
  
"
many
a
flower
be
bear
to
blush
unseen
,
"
and
waste
its
fragrance
on
the
desert
air
.
"
  
<EOS>
from
Thompson
,
that
    
"
It
be
a
delightful
task
"
to
teach
the
young
idea
how
to
shoot
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
from
Shakespeare
she
gain
a
great
store
of
information
 
amongst
the
rest
,
that
    
"
Trifles
light
as
air
,
"
be
,
to
the
jealous

confirmation
strong
,
"
as
proof
of
Holy

"
  
<EOS>
that
  
<EOS>
"
the

upon
,
"
<EOS>
in
corporal
sufferance
feel
a
pang

<EOS>
as

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
that
a

love
always
look
    
"
like
Patience
on
a

"
smile
at
Grief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
far
her
improvement
be
sufficient
 
and
in
many
other
point
she
come
on
exceedingly
well
;
for
though
she
could
not
write
sonnet
,
she
bring
herself
to
read
them
;
and
though
there
seem
no
chance
of
her
throw
a
whole
party
into
rapture
by
a
prelude
on
the
pianoforte
,
of
her
own
composition
,
she
could
listen
to
other
people
's
performance
with
very
little
fatigue
.
<EOS>
Her
great
deficiency
be
in
the
pencil
 
<EOS>
she
have
no
notion
of
draw
 
not
enough
even
to
attempt
a
sketch
of
her
lover
's
profile
,
that
she
may
be
detect
in
the
design
.
<EOS>
there
she
fall
miserably
short
of
the
true
heroic
height
.
<EOS>
at
present
she
do
not
know
her
own
poverty
,
for
she
have
no
lover
to
portray
.
<EOS>
She
have
reach
the
age
of
seventeen
,
without
have
see
one
amiable
youth
who
could
call
forth
her
sensibility
,
without
have
inspire
one
real
passion
,
and
without
have
excite
even
any
admiration
but
what
be
very
moderate
and
very
transient
.
<EOS>
this
be
strange
indeed
!
<EOS>
but
strange
thing
may
be
generally
account
for
if
their
cause
be
fairly
search
out
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
one
lord
in
the
neighbourhood
;
no
 
not
even
a
baronet
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
one
family
among
their
acquaintance
who
have
rear
and
support
a
boy
accidentally
find
at
their
door
 
not
one
young
man
whose
origin
be
unknown
.
<EOS>
Her
father
have
no
ward
,
and
the
squire
of
the
parish
no
child
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
a
young
lady
be
to
be
a
heroine
,
the
perverseness
of
forty
surround
family
can
not
prevent
her
.
<EOS>
something
must
and
will
happen
to
throw
a
hero
in
her
way
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Allen

and
his
lady
,
a
good

humoured

fond
of
Miss
Morland

and
probably
aware
that
if
adventure
will
not
befall

it

when
in

pretty
 
and
her
mind
about
as
ignorant
and
uninformed
as
the
female
mind
at
seventeen
usually

<EOS>
when
the
hour
of
departure
draw
near

the
maternal
anxiety
of
Mrs.
Morland
will
be
naturally
suppose
to
be
most
severe

<EOS>
a
thousand
alarm
presentiment

evil

her
beloved
Catherine
from
this
terrific
separation

oppress
her
heart
with
sadness
,
and
drown
her
in
tear
for
the
last
day
or
two
of

;
and
advice
of
the
most
important

nature
must
of
course
flow
from
her

their
parting
conference

at
such
a

relieve
the
fulness

<EOS>
who
would
not
think
so
?
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Morland
know
so
little
of
lord

baronet
,
that
she
entertain
no
notion
of
their
general
mischievousness
,
and
be
wholly
unsuspicious

Her

"
I

you

up
very
warm

everything

do

on
the

with
a
degree

moderation

composure

which
seem
rather
consistent

common

with
the
refined
susceptibility

the
tender
emotion

the
first
separation

ought
always
to

Her

nothing

a
fear

on
Mrs.

side
,
of
have
once
leave
her
clog
behind
her
at
an
inn

that

It

some
description

Mrs.

may
be
able
to
judge
in
what
manner
her
action
will
hereafter
tend
to
promote
the
general
distress
of
the
work
,
and
how
she
will
,
probably
,
contribute
to
reduce
poor
Catherine
to
all
the
desperate
wretchedness
of
which
a
last
volume
be
capable
 
whether
by
her
imprudence
,
vulgarity
,
or
jealousy
 
whether
by
intercept

<EOS>
Mrs.

She

<EOS>
the

a

the
choice

intelligent
man

Mr.

<EOS>
in
one
respect
she
be
admirably
fit
to
introduce
a
young

into
public

be
as
fond
of
go
everywhere
and
see
everything
herself
as
any
young

be
.
<EOS>
Dress
be
her
passion
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
most
harmless
delight
in
be
fine
;
and
our
heroine
's
entree
into
life
could
not
take
place
till
after
three
or
four
day
have
be
spend
in
learn
what
be
mostly
wear
,
and
her
chaperone
be
provide
with
a
dress
of
the
new
fashion
.
<EOS>
Catherine
too
make
some
purchase
herself
,
and
when
all
these
matter
be
arrange
,
the
important
evening
come
which
be
to
usher
her
into
the
Upper
Rooms
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
be
cut
and
dress
by
the
good
hand
,
her
clothe
put
on
with
care
,
and
both
Mrs.
Allen
and
her
maid
declare
she
look
quite
as
she
should
do
.
<EOS>
with
such
encouragement
,
Catherine
hope
at
least
to
pass
uncensured
through
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
as
for
admiration
,
it
be
always
very
welcome
when
it
come
,
but
she
do
not
depend
on
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Allen
be
so
long
in
dress
that
they
do
not
enter
the
ballroom
till
late
.
<EOS>
the
season
be
full
,
the
room
crowd
,
and
the
two
lady
squeeze
in
as
well
as
they
could
.
<EOS>
as
for
Mr.
Allen
,
he
repair
directly
to
the
card
-
room
,
and
leave
them
to
enjoy
a
mob
by
themselves
.
<EOS>
with
more
care
for
the
safety
of
her
new
gown
than
for
the
comfort
of
her
protegee
,
Mrs.
Allen
make
her
way
through
the
throng
of
man
by
the
door
,
as
swiftly
as
the
necessary
caution
would
allow
;
Catherine
,
however
,
keep
close
at
her
side
,
and
link
her
arm
too
firmly
within
her
friend
be
to
be
tear
asunder
by
any
common
effort
of
a
struggle
assembly
.
<EOS>
but
to
her
utter
amazement
she
find
that
to
proceed
along
the
room
be
by
no
means
the
way
to
disengage
themselves
from
the
crowd
;
it
seem
rather
to
increase
as
they
go
on
,
whereas
she
have
imagine
that
when
once
fairly
within
the
door
,
they
should
easily
find
seat
and
be
able
to
watch
the
dance
with
perfect
convenience
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
far
from
be
the
case
,
and
though
by
unwearied
diligence
they
gain
even
the
top
of
the
room
,
their
situation
be
just
the
same
;
they
see
nothing
of
the
dancer
but
the
high
feather
of
some
of
the
lady
.
<EOS>
still
they
move
on
 
something
well
<EOS>
be
yet
in
view
;
and
by
a
continued
exertion
of
strength
and
ingenuity
they
find
themselves
at
last
in
the
passage
behind
the
high
bench
.
<EOS>
here
there
be
something
less
of
crowd
than
below
;
and
hence
Miss
Morland
have
a
comprehensive
view
of
all
the
company
beneath
her
,
and
of
all
the
danger
of
her
late
passage
through
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
splendid
sight
,
and
she
begin
,
for
the
first
time
that
evening
,
to
feel
herself
at
a
ball
:
she
long
to
dance
,
but
she
have
not
an
acquaintance
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Allen
do
all
that
she
could
do
in
such
a
case
by
say
very
placidly
,
every
now
and
then
,
"
I
wish
you
could
dance
,
<EOS>
my
dear
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
could
get
a
partner
.
<EOS>
"
for
some
time
her
young
friend
feel
oblige
to
her
for
these
wish
;
but
they
be
repeat
so
often
,
and
prove
so
totally
ineffectual
,
that
Catherine
grow
tired
at
last
,
and
would
thank
her
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
not
long
able
,
however
,
to
enjoy
the
repose
of
the
eminence
they
have
so
laboriously
gain
.
<EOS>
everybody
be
shortly
in
motion
for
tea
,
and
they
must
squeeze
out
like
the
rest
.
<EOS>
Catherine
begin
to
feel
something
of
disappointment
 
she
be
tired
of
be
continually
press
against
by
people
,
the
generality
of
whose
face
possess
nothing
to
interest
,
and
with
all
of
whom
she
be
so
wholly
unacquainted
that
she
could
not
relieve
the
irksomeness
of
imprisonment
by
the
exchange
of
a
syllable
with
any
of
her
fellow
captive
;
and
when
at
last
arrive
in
the
tea
-
room
,
she
feel
yet
more
the
awkwardness
of
have
no
party
to
join
,
no
acquaintance
to
claim
,
no
gentleman
to
assist
them
.
<EOS>
They
see
nothing
of
Mr.
Allen
;
and
after
look
about
them
in
vain
for
a
more
eligible
situation
,
be
oblige
to
sit
down
at
the
end
of
a
table
,
at
which
a
large
party
be
already
place
,
without
have
anything
to
do
there
,
or
anybody
to
speak
to
,
except
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Allen
congratulate
herself
,
as
soon
as
they
be
seat
,
on
have
preserve
her
gown
from
injury
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
have
be
very
shocking
to
have
it
tear
,
"
say
she
,
"
would
not
it
?
<EOS>
It
be
such
a
delicate
muslin
.
<EOS>
for
my
part
I
have
not
see
anything
I
like
so
well
in
the
whole
room
,
I
assure
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
uncomfortable
it
be
,
"
whisper
Catherine
,
"
not
to
have
a
single
acquaintance
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
my
dear
,
"
reply
Mrs.
Allen
,
with
perfect
serenity
,
"
it
be
very
uncomfortable
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
shall
we
do
?
<EOS>
the
gentleman
and
lady
at
this
table
look
as
if
they
wonder
why
we
come
here
 
<EOS>
we
seem
force
ourselves
into
their
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
aye
,
so
we
do
.
<EOS>
that
be
very
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
I
wish
we
have
a
large
acquaintance
here
.

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
"
very
true
,
my

if
we
know
anybody
we
would
join

directly

the
Skinners

here
last
year
 
<EOS>
I
wish
they
be
here
now

"
  
"
have
not

away
as

"
  
<EOS>
"
no
more
there
be
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
how
very
provoking
!
<EOS>
but
I
think
we
have
better
sit
still
,
for
one
get
so
tumble
in
such
a
crowd
!
<EOS>
how
be
my
head
,
my

somebody
give
me
a
push

"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
,
it
look
very
nice
.
<EOS>
but
,
dear
Mrs.
Allen
,
be
you
sure
there
be
nobody
you
know
in
all
this
multitude
of
people
?
<EOS>
I
think
you
must
know
somebody
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
,
upon
my
word
 
I
wish
I
do

<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
a
large
acquaintance
here
with
all
my
heart
,
and
then
I
should
get
you
a
partner

<EOS>
I
should
be
so
glad
to
have
you

looking
woman

odd
gown
she

on
!
<EOS>
how
old

fashioned
it

!
<EOS>
look
at
the
back

"
  
<EOS>
after
some
time
they
receive
an
offer
of
tea
from
one
of
their
neighbour
;
it
be
thankfully
accept
,
and
this
introduce
a
light
conversation
with
the
gentleman
who
offer
it
,
which
be
the
only
time
that
anybody
speak
to
them
during
the
evening
,
till
they
be
discover
and
join
by
Mr.

when
the
dance

over
.
  
<EOS>
"

Miss
Morland

"
say
he
,
directly
,
"
I
hope
you
have
have
an
agreeable
ball

"
  
<EOS>
"
very
agreeable
indeed
,
"
she
reply
,
vainly
endeavour
to
hide
a
great
yawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
she
have
be
able
to
dance
,
"
say
his
wife
;
<EOS>
"
I
wish
we
could
have
get
a
partner
for
her

<EOS>
I
have
be
say
how
glad
I
should
be
if
the
Skinners
be
here
this
winter
instead
of
last
;
or
if
the
Parrys
have
come
,
as
they
talk
of
once
,
she
may
have
dance
with
George
Parry

<EOS>
I

so
sorry
she

"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
do
better
another
evening
I
hope

be
Mr.
Allen
's
consolation
.
  
<EOS>
the
company
begin
to
disperse
when
the
dancing
be
over
 
enough
to
leave
space
for
the
remainder
to
walk
about
in
some
comfort
;
and
now
be
the
time
for
a
heroine
,
who
have
not
yet
play
a
very
distinguished
part
in
the
event
of
the
evening
,
to
be
notice
and
admire
.
<EOS>
every
five
minute
,
by
remove
some
of
the
crowd
,
give
great
opening
for
her
charm
.
<EOS>
She
be
now
see
by
many
young
man
who
have
not
be
near
her
before
.
<EOS>
not
one
,
however
,
start
with
rapturous
wonder
on
behold
her
,
no
whisper
of
eager
inquiry
run
round
the
room
,
nor
be
she
once
call
a
divinity
by
anybody
.
<EOS>
yet
Catherine
be
in
very
good
look
,
and
have
the
company
only
see
her
three
year
before
,
they
would
now
have
think
her
exceedingly
handsome
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
look
at
,
however
,
and
with
some
admiration
;
for
,
in
her
own
hearing
,
two
gentleman
pronounce
her
to
be
a
pretty
girl
.
<EOS>
such
word
have
their
due
effect
;
she
immediately
think
the
evening
pleasanter
than
she
have
find
it
before
 
her
humble
vanity
be
content
 
<EOS>
she
feel
more
obliged
to
the
two
young
man
for
this
simple
praise
than
a
true
-
quality
heroine
would
have
be
for
fifteen
sonnet
in
celebration
of
her
charm
,
and
go
to
her
chair
in
good
humour
with
everybody
,
and
perfectly
satisfied
with
her
share
of
public
attention
.
    
<EOS>
every
morning
now
bring
its
regular
duty
 
<EOS>
shop
be
to
be
visit
;
some
new
part
of
the
town
to
be
look
at
;
and
the
pump
-
room
to
be
attend
,
where
they
parade
up
and
down
for
an
hour
,
look
at
everybody
and
speak
to
no
one
.
<EOS>
the
wish
of
a
numerous
acquaintance
in
Bath
be
still
uppermost
with
Mrs.
Allen
,
and
she
repeat
it
after
every
fresh
proof
,
which
every
morning
bring
,
of
her
know
nobody
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
They
make
their
appearance
in
the
Lower
Rooms
;
and
here
fortune
be
more
favourable
to
our
heroine
.
<EOS>
the
master
of
the
ceremony
introduce
to
her
a
very
gentlemanlike
young
man
as
a
partner
;
his
name
be
Tilney
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
be
about
four
or
five
and
twenty
,
be
rather
tall
,
have
a
pleasing
countenance
,
a
very
intelligent
and
lively
eye
,
and
,
if
not
quite
handsome
,
be
very
near
it
.
<EOS>
His
address
be
good
,
and
Catherine
feel
herself
in
high
luck
.
<EOS>
there
be
little
leisure
for
speak
while
they
dance
;
but
when
they
be
seat
at
tea
,
she
find
him
as
agreeable
as
she
have
already
give
him
credit
for
be
.
<EOS>
He
talk
with
fluency
and
spirit
 
and
there
be
an
archness
and
pleasantry
in
his
manner
which
interested
,
though
it
be
hardly
understand
by
her
.
<EOS>
after
chat
some
time
on
such
matter
as
naturally
arise
from
the
object
around
them
,
he
suddenly
address
her
with
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
hitherto
be
very
remiss
,
madam
,
in
the
proper
attention
of
a
partner
here
;
I
have
not
yet
ask
you
how
long
you
have
be
in
Bath
;
whether
you
be
ever
here
before
;
whether
you
have
be
at
the
Upper
Rooms
,
the
theatre
,
and
the
concert
;
and
how
you
like
the
place
altogether
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
very
negligent
 
but
be
you
now
at
leisure
to
satisfy
me
in
these
particular
?
<EOS>
if
you
be
I
will
begin
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
give
yourself
that
trouble
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
trouble
,
I
assure
you
,
madam
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
form
his
feature
into
a
set
smile
,
and
affectedly
soften
his
voice
,
he
add
,
with
a
simper
air
,
"
have

<EOS>
about

reply
Catherine
,
try
not
to

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
with
affected
astonishment

<EOS>
"
why

be
surprised

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
indeed

"
say
he
,
in
his
natural
tone

"
<EOS>
but
some
emotion
must
appear
to
be
raise
by
your
reply
,
and
surprise
be
more
easily
assume
,
and
not
less
reasonable
than
any
other

<EOS>
now
let
us
go
on

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
 
I
like
it
very
well

"
  
<EOS>
"
now
I
must
give
one
smirk
,
and
then
we
may
be
rational
again
.
"
<EOS>
Catherine
turn
away
her
head
,
not
know
whether
she
may
venture
to
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
what

of
me

say
he
gravely
 
"
I

but
be
strangely
harass
by
a
queer

who
would
make
me
dance
with
him
,
and
distress
me
by
his
nonsense

indeed
I

I

I

no

perhaps
you

I

<EOS>
these
be
point
in
which
a
doubt
be
equally
possible
.
<EOS>
not
keep
a
journal
!
<EOS>
how
be
your
absent
cousin
to
understand
the
tenour
of
your
life
in
Bath
without
one
?
<EOS>
how
be
the
civility
and
compliment
of
every
day
to
be
relate
as
they
ought
to
be
,
unless
note
down
every

<EOS>
how
be
your

<EOS>
My
dear
madam
,
I
be
not
so
ignorant
of
young
lady
'
way
as
you
wish
to
believe
me
;
it
be
this
delightful
habit
of
journaling
which
largely
contribute
to
form
the
easy
style
of
write
for
which
lady
be
so
generally
celebrate
.
<EOS>
everybody
allow
that
the
talent
of
write
agreeable
letter
be
peculiarly
female
.
<EOS>
nature
may
have
do
something
,
but
I
be
sure
it
must
be
essentially
assist
by
the
practice
of
keep
a
journal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
sometimes
think
,
"
say
Catherine
,
doubtingly
,
"
whether
lady
do
write
so
much
well
letter
than
gentleman
!
<EOS>
that
be
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
think
the
superiority
be
always
on
our
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
far
as
I
have
have
opportunity
of
judging
,
it
appear
to
me
that
the
usual
style
of
letter
-
writing
among
woman
be
faultless
,
except
in
three
particular
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
be
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
general
deficiency
of
subject
,
a
total
inattention
to
stop
,
and
a
very
frequent
ignorance
of
grammar
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
!
<EOS>
I
need
not
have
be
afraid
of
disclaim
the
compliment
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
think
too
highly
of
us
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
should
no
more
lay
it
down
as
a
general
rule
that
woman
write
well
letter
than
man
,
than
that
they
sing
well
duet
,
or
draw
well
landscape
.
<EOS>
in
every
power
,
of
which
taste
be
the
foundation
,
excellence
be
pretty
fairly
divide
between
the
sex

<EOS>
They

Mrs.

"
<EOS>
My

she

this
pin
out

nine

that

muslin

do
you

particularly
well

I
always

allow

my

have
often
trust
me
in
the
choice
of
a
gown
.
<EOS>
I
buy
one
for
her
the
other
day

it
be
pronounce
to
be
a
prodigious
bargain
by
every
lady
who
see
it

<EOS>
I
give
but
five
shilling
a
yard
for
it

and
a
true
indian
muslin

<EOS>
Mrs.

strike
by
his

<EOS>
"
man
commonly
take
so
little
notice

she

I
can
never

<EOS>
"
It

very
pretty

gravely

it

I

I

<EOS>
"
how
can
you

<EOS>

I
be

of

Mrs.

;

so
I
tell
Miss
Morland
when
she
buy
it

<EOS>

but
then
you
know

muslin
always
turn
to

Miss
Morland
will
get
enough
out
of

<EOS>
Muslin
can

I

forty

Mr.

<EOS>
Catherine
fear

as
she
listen
to

that

indulge
himself

They

on
the

side
at

with
a
strong

whether

but
I
hope
it
be
no
more
than
in
a
slight
slumber

a

doze
at

for
if
it

as
a

maintain

that
no

can
be
justify
in
fall

it

improper

that
he

he

with
more

Catherine
hasten

of
see
Mr.

there
before

no

absent

<EOS>
"
what
a
delightful
place
Bath
be

say
Mrs.
Allen
as
they
sit
down
near
the
great
clock
,
after
parade
the
room
till
they
be
tired
;
"
and
how
pleasant
it
would
be
if

any
acquaintance
here

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
sentiment

be
utter
so
often

Mrs.

have
no

reason

it

follow
with
more
advantage
now

but
we
be
tell
to
"
despair
of
nothing
we

attain

as
"
unwearied
diligence
our

would
gain

and
the
unwearied
diligence
with
which
she
have
every
day
wish
for
the
same
thing
be
at
length
to
have
its
just
reward

hardly
have
she

ten
minute

"
I

I
can
not

mistake

it

I

the
pleasure
of
see
you

but
be
not
your

"
<EOS>
this
question
answer
,
as
it
readily
be
,
the
stranger
pronounce
her
to
be
Thorpe

and
Mrs.
Allen
immediately
recognize
the
feature
of
a
former
schoolfellow
and
intimate
,
whom
she
have
see
only
once
since
their
respective
marriage

and
that
many
year
ago

<EOS>
Their
joy
on
this
meeting
be
very
great

as
well

fifteen
year

good

after
observe
how
time
have
slip
away
since
they
be
last
together
,
how
little
they
have
think
of
meet
in
Bath
,
and
what
a
pleasure
it
be
to
see
an
old
friend
,
they
proceed
to
make
inquiry
and
give
intelligence
as
to
their
family
,
sister

and
cousin
,
talk
both
together
,
far
more
ready
to
give
than
to

information
,
and
each
hear
very
little
of
what
the
other

<EOS>
Mrs.
Thorpe
,
however
,
have
one
great
advantage
as
a
talker
,
over
Mrs.
Allen
,
in
a
family
of
child
;
and
when
she
expatiate
on
the
talent
of
her
son

the
beauty
of

when

Mrs.

no
similar
information

no
similar
triumph

on
the
unwilling

unbelieving

to
all
these
maternal
effusion

console
herself
,
however
,
with
the
discovery

which
her
keen

soon
make
,
that

for
a
moment
Catherine
be
surprised

but
Mrs.
Thorpe
and
her
daughter
have
scarcely
begin
the
history
of
their
acquaintance
with
Mr.
James
Morland
,
before
she
remember
that
her

brother
have
lately
form
an
intimacy
with
a
young
man
of
his
own
college
,
of
the
name
of
Thorpe

and
that
he
have
spend
the
last
week
of
the
Christmas

near

<EOS>
the

many
obliging

through
the
friendship
of

,
which
Catherine
hear
with
pleasure

and
answer
with
all
the
pretty
expression
she
could
command

and
,
as
the
first
proof
of
amity

she
be
soon
invite

accept
an

take
a
turn
with
her
about

Catherine

to
Miss

friendship
be
certainly
the
fine
balm
for
the
pang

<EOS>
Their
conversation
turn
upon
those
subject
,
of
which
the
free
discussion
have
generally
much
to
do
in
perfect
a
sudden
intimacy
between
two
young

such
as
dress

and
at
least
four

have
a
very
decide
advantage

she
could
compare
the
ball
of
Bath
with
those
of
Tunbridge

its
fashion
with
the
fashion
of
London
;
could
rectify
the
opinion
of

could
discover
a
flirtation
between
any
gentleman

only
smile
on

other
;
and
point
out
a
quiz
through
the
thickness
of
a

receive
due
admiration
from
Catherine
,
to
whom
they
be
entirely
new
;
and
the
respect
which
they
naturally
inspire
may
have
be
too
great
for
familiarity
,
have
not
the
easy
gaiety
of
Miss
Thorpe
's
manner
,
and
her
frequent
expression
of
delight
on
this
acquaintance
with
her
,
soften
down
every
feeling
of
awe
,
and
leave
nothing
but
tender
affection
.
<EOS>
Their
increase
attachment
be
not
to
be
satisfied
with
half
a
dozen
turn
in
the
pump
-
room
,
but
require
,
when
they
all
quit
it
together
,
that
Miss
Thorpe
should
accompany
Miss
Morland
to
the
very
door
of
Mr.
Allen
's
house
;
and
that
they
should
there
part
with
a
most
affectionate
and
lengthen
shake
of
hand
,
after
learn
,
to
their
mutual
relief
,
that
they
should
see
each
other
across
the
theatre
at
night
,
and
say
their
prayer
in
the
same
chapel
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
Catherine
then
run
directly
upstairs
,
and
watch
Miss
Thorpe
's
progress
down
the
street
from
the
drawing
-
room
window
;
admire
the
graceful
spirit
of
her
walk
,
the
fashionable
air
of
her
figure
and
dress
;
and
feel
grateful
,
as
well
she
may
,
for
the
chance
which
have
procure
her
such
a
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Thorpe
be
a
widow
,
and
not
a
very
rich
one
;
she
be
a
good
-
humoured
,
well
-
mean
woman
,
and
a
very
indulgent
mother
.
<EOS>
Her
eld
daughter
have
great
personal
beauty
,
and
the
young
one
,
by
pretend
to
be
as
handsome
as
their
sister
,
imitate
her
air
,
and
dress
in
the
same
style
,
do
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
this
brief
account
of
the
family
be
intend
to
supersede
the
necessity
of
a
long
and
minute
detail
from
Mrs.
Thorpe
herself
,
of
her
past
adventure
and
suffering
,
which
may
otherwise
be
expect
to
occupy
the
three
or
four
follow
chapter
;
in
which
the
worthlessness
of
lord
and
attorney
may
be
set
forth
,
and
conversation
,
which
have
pass
twenty
year
before
,
be
minutely
repeat
.
    
<EOS>
Catherine
be
not
so
much
engage
at
the
theatre
that
evening
,
in
return
the
nod
and
smile
of
Miss
Thorpe
,
though
they
certainly
claim
much
of
her
leisure
,
as
to
forget
to
look
with
an
inquire
eye
for
Mr.
Tilney
in
every
box
which
her
eye
could
reach
;
but
she
look
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tilney
be
no
fonder
of
the
play
than
the
pump
-
room
.
<EOS>
She
hope
to
be
more
fortunate
the
next
day
;
and
when
her
wish
for
fine
weather
be
answer
by
see
a
beautiful
morning
,
she
hardly
feel
a
doubt
of
it
;
for
a
fine
Sunday
in
Bath
empty
every
house
of
its
inhabitant
,
and
all
the
world
appear
on
such
an
occasion
to
walk
about
and
tell
their
acquaintance
what
a
charming
day
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
divine
service
be
over
,
the
Thorpes
and
Allens
eagerly
join
each
other
;
and
after
stay
long
enough
in
the
pump
-
room
to
discover
that
the
crowd
be
insupportable
,
and
that
there
be
not
a
genteel
face
to
be
see
,
which
everybody
discover
every
Sunday
throughout
the
season
,
they
hasten
away
to
the
Crescent
,
to
breathe
the
fresh
air
of
well
company
.
<EOS>
here
Catherine
and
Isabella
,
arm
in
arm
,
again
taste
the
sweet
of
friendship
in
an
unreserved
conversation
;
they
talk
much
,
and
with
much
enjoyment
;
but
again
be
Catherine
disappoint
in
her
hope
of
reseee
her
partner
.
<EOS>
He
be
nowhere
to
be
meet
with
;
every
search
for
him
be
equally
unsuccessful
,
in
morning
lounge
or
evening
assembly
;
neither
at
the
Upper
nor
Lower
Rooms
,
at
dressed
or
undressed
ball
,
be
he
perceivable
;
nor
among
the
walker
,
the
horseman
,
or
the
curricle
-
driver
of
the
morning
.
<EOS>
His
name
be
not
in
the
pump
-
room
book
,
and
curiosity
could
do
no
more
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
go
from
Bath
.
<EOS>
yet
he
have
not
mention
that
his
stay
would
be
so
short
!
<EOS>
this
sort
of
mysteriousness
,
which
be
always
so
become
in
a
hero
,
throw
a
fresh
grace
in
Catherine
's
imagination
around
his
person
and
manner
,
and
increase
her
anxiety
to
know
more
of
him
.
<EOS>
from
the
Thorpes
she
could
learn
nothing
,
for
they
have
be
only
two
day
in
Bath
before
they
meet
with
Mrs.
Allen
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
subject
,
however
,
in
which
she
often
indulge
with
her
fair
friend
,
from
whom
she
receive
every
possible
encouragement
to
continue
to
think
of
him
;
and
his
impression
on
her
fancy
be
not
suffer
therefore
to
weaken
.
<EOS>
Isabella
be
very
sure
that
he
must
be
a
charming
young
man
,
and
be
equally
sure
that
he
must
have
be
delight
with
her
dear
Catherine
,
and
would
therefore
shortly
return
.
<EOS>
She
like
him
the
well
for
be
a
clergyman
,
"
for
she
must
confess
herself
very
partial
to
the
profession
"
;
and
something
like
a
sigh
escape
her
as
she
say
it
.
<EOS>
perhaps
Catherine
be
wrong
in
not
demand
the
cause
of
that
gentle
emotion
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
not
experience
enough
in
the
finesse
of
love
,
or
the
duty
of
friendship
,
to
know
when
delicate
raillery
be
properly
call
for
,
or
when
a
confidence
should
be
force
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Allen
be
now
quite
happy
 
quite
satisfied
with
Bath
.
<EOS>
She
have
find
some
acquaintance
,
have
be
so
lucky
too
as
to
find
in
them
the
family
of
a
most
worthy
old
friend
;
and
,
as
the
completion
of
good
fortune
,
have
find
these
friend
by
no
means
so
expensively
dressed
as
herself
.
<EOS>
Her
daily
expression
be
no
longer
,
"
I
wish
we
have
some
acquaintance
in
Bath
!
<EOS>
"
They
be
change
into
,
"
how
glad
I
be
we
have
meet
with
Mrs.
Thorpe
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
be
as
eager
in
promote
the
intercourse
of
the
two
family
,
as
her
young
charge
and
Isabella
themselves
could
be
;
never
satisfied
with
the
day
unless
she
spend
the
chief
of
it
by
the
side
of
Mrs.
Thorpe
,
in
what
they
call
conversation
,
but
in
which
there
be
scarcely
ever
any
exchange
of
opinion
,
and
not
often
any
resemblance
of
subject
,
for
Mrs.
Thorpe
talk
chiefly
of
her
child
,
and
Mrs.
Allen
of
her
gown
.
  
<EOS>
the
progress
of
the
friendship
between
Catherine
and
Isabella
be
quick
as
its
beginning
have
be
warm
,
and
they
pass
so
rapidly
through
every
gradation
of
increase
tenderness
that
there
be
shortly
no
fresh
proof
of
it
to
be
give
to
their
friend
or
themselves
.
<EOS>
They
call
each
other
by
their
christian
name
,
be
always
arm
in
arm
when
they
walk
,
pin
up
each
other
's
train
for
the
dance
,
and
be
not
to
be
divide
in
the
set
;
and
if
a
rainy
morning
deprive
them
of
other
enjoyment
,
they
be
still
resolute
in
meeting
in
defiance
of
wet
and
dirt
,
and
shut
themselves
up
,
to
read
novel
together
.
<EOS>
yes
,
novel
;
for
I
will
not
adopt
that
ungenerous
and
impolitic
custom
so
common
with
novel
-
writer
,
of
degrade
by
their
contemptuous
censure
the
very
performance
,
to
the
number
of
which
they
be
themselves
add
 
join
with
their
great
enemy
in
bestow
the
harsh
epithet
on
such
work
,
and
scarcely
ever
permit
them
to
be
read
by
their
own
heroine
,
who
,
if
she
accidentally
take
up
a
novel
,
be
sure
to
turn
over
its
insipid
page
with
disgust
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
if
the
heroine
of
one
novel
be
not
patronize
by
the
heroine
of
another
,
from
whom
can
she
expect
protection
and
regard
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
approve
of
it
.
<EOS>
let
us
leave
it
to
the
reviewer
to
abuse
such
effusion
of
fancy
at
their
leisure
,
and
over
every
new
novel
to
talk
in
threadbare
strain
of
the
trash
with
which
the
press
now
groan
.
<EOS>
let
us
not
desert
one
another
;
we
be
an
injure
body
.
<EOS>
although
our
production
have
afford
more
extensive
and
unaffected
pleasure
than
those
of
any
other
literary
corporation
in
the
world
,
no
species
of
composition
have
be
so
much
decry
.
<EOS>
from
pride
,
ignorance
,
or
fashion
,
our
foe
be
almost
as
many
as
our
reader
.
<EOS>
and
while
the
ability
of
the
nine
-
hundredth
abridger
of
the
History
of
England
,
or
of
the
man
who
collect
and
publish
in
a
volume
some
dozen
line
of
Milton
,
Pope
,
and
prior
,
with
a
paper
from
the
Spectator
,
and
a
chapter
from
Sterne
,
be
eulogize
by
a
thousand
pen
 
there
seem
almost
a
general
wish
of
decry
the
capacity
and
undervalue
the
labour
of
the
novelist
,
and
of
slight
the
performance
which
have
only
genius

wit
,
and
taste
to
recommend
them

<EOS>
"
I

the
young

,
while
she
lay
down
her
book
with
affected
indifference

momentary
shame

<EOS>
"
It
be
only
Cecilia
,
or
Camilla

or
Belinda

or
,
in
short
,
only
some
work
in
which
the
great
power
of
the
mind

in
which
the
most
thorough

<EOS>
now
,
have
the
same
young
lady
be
engage
with
a
volume
of
the
Spectator
,
instead
of
such
a
work
,
how
proudly
would
she
have
produce
the
book
,
and
tell
its
name
;
though
the
chance
must
be
against
her
be
occupy
by
any
part
of
that
voluminous
publication
,
of
which
either
the
matter
or
manner
would
not
disgust
a
young
person
of
taste
:
the
substance
of
its
paper
so
often
consist
in
the
statement
of
improbable
circumstance
,
unnatural
character
,
and
topic
of
conversation
which
no
longer
concern
anyone
live
;
and
their
language
,
too
,
frequently
so
coarse
as
to
give
no
very
favourable
idea
of
the
age
that
could
endure
it
.
    
<EOS>
the
follow
conversation
,
which
take
place
between
the
two
friend
in
the
pump

room
one
morning
,
after
an
acquaintance
of
eight

nine
day
,

give
as
a
speciman
of
their
very
warm
attachment
,
and
of
the
delicacy
,
discretion
,
originality
of
thought
,
and
literary
taste
which
mark
the
reasonableness
of
that
attachment

They
meet
by
appointment
;
and
as
Isabella
have
arrive
nearly
five
minute
before
her
friend
,
her
first
address
naturally
be
,

sit
down
at

enjoy
ourselves

<EOS>
I
have
an
hundred
thing
to
say
to
you

<EOS>
in
the
first
place

I
be
so
afraid

rain
this
morning

just
as
I
want
to
set
off
;
it
look
very
showery
,
and
that
would
have
throw
me
into
agony

I
see
the
prettiest

that
I
do

<EOS>
there
be
nothing
I
would
not
do
for
those
who
be
really
my
friend

<EOS>
I
have
no
notion
of
love
people
by
half
;
it
be
not
my
nature

<EOS>
My
attachment
be
always
excessively
strong

<EOS>
I
tell
Captain
Hunt
at
one
of
our
assembly
this
winter
that
if
he
be
to
tease
me
all
night
,
I
would
not
dance
with
him
,
unless
he
would
allow
Miss
Andrews
to
be
as
beautiful
as
an
angel

<EOS>
the
man
think
us
incapable
of
real
friendship

you
know

I
be
determined
to
show
them
the
difference
.
<EOS>
now
,
if
I
be
to
hear
anybody
speak
slightingly
of
you
,
I
should
fire
up
in
a
moment
:
but
that
be
not
at
all
likely
,
for
you
be
just
the
kind
of
girl
to
be
a
great
favourite
with
the
man

how
can
you

so

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
very
well
;
you
have
so
much
animation

which
be
exactly
what
Miss
Andrews
want
,
for
I
must
confess
<EOS>
there
be
something
amazingly
insipid
about
her

<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you

that
just
after

part
yesterday

I
see

earnestly

It
be
very
true

upon

I
see
how
it

you

indifferent

admiration

that
of

shall

I
can
not

you

your

easily

where
the
heart

really
attach

I
know
very
well
how
little
one
can
be
pleased

the
attention

anybody
else

<EOS>
everything
be
so
insipid

so
uninteresting

that
do

the
beloved
object

<EOS>
I
can
perfectly
comprehend
your
feeling

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
but
you
should
not
persuade
me
that
I
think
so
very
much
about
Mr.

perhaps
I
may
never

My

no

I

while
I
have
Udolpho

I
feel
as

miserable

oh

the
dreadful
black
veil

My

I
be

there
must

Laurentina

skeleton

<EOS>
"
It
be
so
odd
to
me

that
you

never

Udolpho
before

I
suppose
Mrs.
Morland
object
to
novel

no

she
do
not

She
very
often

Sir

an
amazing

I
remember
Miss
Andrews
could
not
get
through
the
first
volume
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not

Udolpho
at

I

it

very
entertaining

<EOS>
"
do
you
indeed
!
<EOS>
You
surprise
me
;
I

it

,
my
dear
catherine
,
have
you
settle
what
to
wear
on
your
head
tonight
?
<EOS>
I
be
determined
at
all
event
to
be
dress
exactly
like
you

take
notice

oh

heaven

<EOS>
I
make
it
a
rule
never

what
they

<EOS>
They
be
very
often
amazingly
impertinent
if
you
do
not
treat
them
with
spirit

make
them
keep
their
distance

I

oh
!

They
give
themselves
such
air

They
be
the
most
conceited
creature
in

think
themselves
of
so
much
importance

by
the
by
,
though
I
have
think
of
it
a
hundred
time

I

always
forget

you

best
dark

fair

I
hardly
know

something
between

brown
 
not
fair

dark

very
well

that
be
exactly
he

<EOS>
I
have
not
forget
your
description
of
Mr.
Tilney
 
"
a
brown
skin
,
with
dark
eye
,
and
rather
dark
hair
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
my
taste
be
different

I
prefer
light
eye
,

as
to
complexion

do
you
know
 
<EOS>
I
like
a
sallow
better
than
any
other
.

You
must

I
have
say
too
much

us
drop
the
subject

<EOS>
Catherine
,
in
some
amazement
,
comply
,
and
after
remain
a
few
moment
silent
,
be
on
the
point
of
revert
to
what
interest
her
at
that
time
rather
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
,
Laurentina
's
skeleton

when

odious

this
half
hour

out

at

<EOS>
away
they
walk
to
the
book
;

while
Isabella
examine
the
name

it
be
Catherine
's
employment
to
watch
the
proceeding
of
these
alarming
young
man

<EOS>
"
They
be
not
come
this
way

they

I
hope
they
be
not

impertinent

to
follow
us

pray
let
me
know
if
they
be
come

I
be
determined
I
will
not
look
up

"
  
<EOS>
in
a
few
moment
Catherine
,
with
unaffected
pleasure
,
assure
her
that
she
nee
not
be
longer
uneasy
,
as
the
gentleman
have
just
leave
the
pump

room

"
and
which
way
be
they
go
?

say
Isabella

turn
hastily
round

"

one
be
a
very
good
-
look
young
man

They
go
towards
the
church

yard

"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
be
amazingly
glad
I
have
get
rid
of
them
!
<EOS>
and
now
,
what
say
you
to
go
to
Edgar
's
building
with
me
,
and
look
at
my
new
hat
?
<EOS>
You
say
you
should
like
to
see
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
readily
agree
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
only
,
"
she
add
,
"
perhaps
we
may
overtake
the
two
young
man

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
<EOS>
never
mind
that
.
<EOS>
if
we
make
haste

we
shall
pass
by
them
presently

I
be
die
to
show
you
my
hat

if
we
only
wait
a
few
minute

there
will
be
no
danger

our
see
them
at
all

not

have
no

way

<EOS>
Catherine
have
nothing
to
oppose
against
such
reasoning
;
and
therefore
,
to
show
the
independence
of
Miss
Thorpe
,
and
her
resolution
of
humble
the
sex

they
set
off
immediately
as
fast
as
they
could

half
a
minute
conduct

the
archway

opposite
Union

here
they

<EOS>
everybody
acquaint
with
Bath
may
remember
the
difficulty
of
cross
Cheap

at
this
point

a
street
of
so
impertinent

a
nature

so
unfortunately
connected
with

it
once
more

and
within

with
a
plain
face

ungraceful

seem
fearful
of
be
too
handsome

the
dress
of

too
much

easy

this

the

of
which
be

lose
on
poor

bring
them
to
the
door
of
Mrs.
Thorpe

lodging

and
the
feeling
of
the
discerning
and
unprejudiced
reader
of
Camilla
give
way
to
the
feeling
of
the
dutiful
and
affectionate
son

as
they
meet
Mrs.
Thorpe

who
have
descry
them
from

where

make
you
look

here
be
Morland

I
come

day
with

so
you
must
look
out
for
a
couple
of
good
bed
somewhere
near

<EOS>
and
this
address
seem
to
satisfy
all
the
fond
wish
of
the
mother
's
heart
,
for
she
receive
him
with
the
most
delighted
and
exulting
affection

<EOS>
on
his
two
young
sister
he
then
bestow
an
equal
portion
of
his
fraternal
tenderness
,
for
he
ask
each
of
them
how
they
do
,
and
observe
that
they
both
look
very
ugly

<EOS>
these
manner
do
not
please
Catherine

he
be
James

judgment

further
buy
off

that
evening

have
she
be
old

vainer
,
such
attack
may
have
do
little
;
but
,
where
youth
and
diffidence
be
united
,
it
require
uncommon
steadiness
of
reason
to
resist
the
attraction
of
be

the
most
charming

in

and
of

so
very
early

that

when

She
could
not

vex
at
the
non

appearance
of
Mr.
Thorpe
,
for
she
not

but
be
likewise
aware
that

as
the
real
dignity

could
not

,
she
be
share
with
the
score
of
other
young

still
sit
down
all
the
discredit
of
want
a
partner

<EOS>
to
be
disgrace
in
the
eye
of
the
world
,
to
wear
the
appearance
of
infamy
while
her
heart
be
all
purity
,
her
action
all
innocence
,
and
the
misconduct
of
another
the
true
source
of
her
debasement
,
be
one
of
those
circumstance
which
peculiarly
belong
to
the
heroine

life
,
and
her
fortitude
under
it
<EOS>
what
particularly
dignify
her
character
.
<EOS>
Catherine
have
fortitude
too
;
she
suffer
,
but
no
murmur
pass
her
lip
.
  
<EOS>
from
this
state
of
humiliation
,
she
be
rouse
,
at
the
end
of
ten
minute
,
to
a
pleasanter
feeling
,
by
see
,
not
Mr.
Thorpe
,
but
Mr.
Tilney
,
within
three
yard
of
the
place
where
they
sit
;
he
seem
to
be
move
that
way
,
but
he
do
not
see
her
,
and
therefore
the
smile
and
the
blush
,
which
his
sudden
reappearance
raise
in
Catherine
,
pass
away
without
sully
her
heroic
importance
.
<EOS>
He
look
as
handsome
and
as
lively
as
ever
,
and
be
talk
with
interest
to
a
fashionable
and
pleasing
-
look
young
woman
,
who
leant
on
his
arm
,
and
whom
Catherine
immediately
guess
to
be
his
sister
;
thus
unthinkingly
throw
away
a
fair
opportunity
of
consider
him
lose
to
her
forever
,
by
be
marry
already
.
<EOS>
but
guide
only
by
what
be
simple
and
probable
,
it
have
never
enter
her
head
that
Mr.
Tilney
could
be
marry
;
he
have
not
behave
,
he
have
not
talk
,
like
the
married
man
to
whom
she
have
be
use
;
he
have
never
mention
a
wife
,
and
he
have
acknowledge
a
sister
.
<EOS>
from
these
circumstance
spring
the
instant
conclusion
of
his
sister
be
now
be
by
his
side
;
and
therefore
,
instead
of
turn
of
a
deathlike
paleness
and
fall
in
a
fit
on
Mrs.
Allen
's
bosom
,
Catherine
sit
erect
,
in
the
perfect
use
of
her
sense
,
and
with
cheek
only
a
little
red
than
usual

<EOS>
Mr.

his

likewise
,
and
Catherine

Mr.

eye
,
instantly
receive
from
him
the
smile
tribute
of
recognition

<EOS>
She
return
it
with
pleasure
,
and
then
advance
still
near
,
he
speak
both
to
her

Mrs.

he
be
very
civilly

He

on
the

<EOS>
I
tell
Mr.

,
when
he
talk

be
sick
of
it

that
I
be
sure
he
should
not
complain
,
for
it
be
so
very
agreeable
<EOS>
a
place

that
it
be
much
well
to
be
here

at

I
tell
him

no

<EOS>
a
neighbour

Dr.

be
here
for
his
health
last
winter
,
and
come
away
quite
stout

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
circumstance
must
give
great
encouragement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
 
and
Dr.
Skinner
and
his
family
be
here
three
month
;
so
I
tell
Mr.

he
must
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
get
away
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
they
be
interrupt
by
a
request
from
Mrs.
Thorpe
to
Mrs.
Allen
,
that
she
would
move
a
little
to
accommodate
Mrs.
Hughes
and
Miss
Tilney
with
seat
,
as
they
have
agree
to
join
their
party
.
<EOS>
this
be
accordingly
do
,
Mr.
Tilney
still
continue
stand
before
them
;
and
after
a
few
minute
'
consideration
,
he
ask
Catherine
to
dance
with
him
.
<EOS>
this
compliment
,
delightful
as
it
be
,
produce
severe
mortification
to
the
lady
;
and
in
give
her
denial
,
she
express
her
sorrow
on
the
occasion
so
very
much
as
if
she
really
feel
it
that
have
<EOS>
Thorpe
,
who
join
her
just
afterwards
,
be
half
a
minute
earlier
,
he
may
have
think
her
suffering
rather
too
acute
.
<EOS>
the
very
easy
manner
in
which
he
then
tell
her
that
he
have
keep
her
waiting
do
not
by
any
mean
reconcile
her
more
to
her
lot
;
nor
do
the
particular
which
he
enter
into
while
they
be
stand
up
,
of
the
horse
and
dog
of
the
friend
whom
he
have
just
leave
,
and
of
a
propose
exchange
of
terrier
between
them
,
interest
her
so
much
as
to
prevent
her
look
very
often
towards
that
part
of
the
room
where
she
have
leave
Mr.
Tilney
.
<EOS>
of
her
dear
Isabella
,
to
whom
she
particularly
long
to
point
out
that
gentleman
,
she
could
see
nothing
.
<EOS>
They
be
in
different
set
.
<EOS>
She
be
separate
from
all
her
party
,
and
away
from
all
her
acquaintance
;
one
mortification
succeed
another
,
and
from
the
whole
she
deduce
this
useful
lesson
,
that
to
go
previously
engage
to
a
ball
do
not
necessarily
increase
either
the
dignity
or
enjoyment
of
a
young
lady
.
<EOS>
from
such
a
moralizing
strain
as
this
,
she
be
suddenly
rouse
by
a
touch
on
the
shoulder
,
and
turn
round
,
perceive
Mrs.
Hughes
directly
behind
her
,
attend
by
Miss
Tilney
and
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Miss
Morland
,
"
say
she
,
"
for
this
liberty
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
anyhow
get
to
Miss
Thorpe
,
and
<EOS>
Mrs.
Thorpe
say
she
be
sure
you
would
not
have
the
least
objection
to
let
in
this
young
lady
by
you
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hughes
could
not
have
apply
to
any
creature
in
the
room
more
happy
to
oblige
her
than
Catherine
.
<EOS>
the
young
lady
be
introduce
to
each
other
,
Miss
Tilney
express
a
proper
sense
of
such
goodness
,
Miss
Morland
with
the
real
delicacy
of
a
generous
mind
make
light
of
the
obligation
;
and
Mrs.
Hughes
,
satisfied
with
have
so
respectably
settle
her
young
charge
,
return
to
her
party
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tilney
have
a
good
figure
,
a
pretty
face
,
and
a
very
agreeable
countenance
;
and
her
air
,
though
it
have
not
all
the
decide
pretension
,
<EOS>
the
resolute
stylishness
of
Miss
Thorpe
's
,
have
more
real
elegance
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
show
good
sense
and
good
breeding
;
they
be
neither
shy
nor
affectedly
open
;
and
she
seem
capable
of
be
young
,
attractive
,
and
at
a
ball
without
want
to
fix
the
attention
of
every
man
near
her
,
and
without
exaggerated
feeling
of
ecstatic
delight
or
inconceivable
vexation
on
every
little
trifling
occurrence
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
interested
at
once
by
her
appearance
and
her
relationship
to
Mr.
Tilney
,
be
desirous
of
be
acquaint
with
her
,
and
readily
talk
therefore
whenever
she
could
think
of
anything
to
say
,
and
have
courage
and
leisure
for
say
it
.
<EOS>
but
the
hindrance
throw
in
the
way
of
a
very
speedy
intimacy
,
by
the
frequent
want
of
one
or
more
of
these
requisite
,
prevent
their
do
more
than
go
through
the
first
rudiment
of
an
acquaintance
,
by
inform
themselves
how
well
the
other
like
Bath
<EOS>
,
how
much
she
admire
its
building
and
surround
country
,
whether
she
draw
,
or
play
,
or
sing
,
and
whether
she
be
fond
of
ride
on
horseback
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
dance
be
scarcely
conclude
before
Catherine
find
her
arm
gently
seize
by
her
faithful
Isabella
,
who
in
great
spirit
exclaim
,
"
at

<EOS>
My

creature
,
I
have

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
"
My

how

<EOS>
I

so
I
tell
your
brother
all
the

he
would
not

<EOS>
do
go

Mr.

I

<EOS>
all

<EOS>
be
not
it
so

Mr.

<EOS>
but
you
man
be
all
so
immoderately
lazy
!
<EOS>
I
have
be
scold
him
to
such
a
degree
,
my
dear
Catherine
,
you
would
be
quite
amazed
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
never
stand
upon
ceremony
with
such
people
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
look
at
that
young
lady
with
the
white
bead
round
her
head
,
"
whisper
Catherine
,
detach
her
friend
from
James

<EOS>
"
It

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
Heavens

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
let
me
look

this
moment

<EOS>
what
a
delightful

<EOS>
I
never

where

<EOS>
be

<EOS>
point
him
out
to
me
this
instant

<EOS>
I
die
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Morland
,
you
be
not

listen
.
<EOS>
We
be
not

about
you

but
what
be
all
this

about

<EOS>
what

go
on

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

there
now

I
know
how
it
would
be

You

such
restless

talk
of
the
curiosity
of
woman

indeed

'
<EOS>
tis
nothing

be
satisfied

for
you

matter

<EOS>

and
be
that
likely
to
satisfy
me

do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
declare
I
never

anything

you

what
can
it
signify
to
you
,
what
we
be
talk
of
.
<EOS>
perhaps
we
be
talk
about
you
;
therefore
I
would
advise
you
not
to
listen
,
or
you
may
happen
to
hear
something
not
very
agreeable
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
this
commonplace
chatter
,
which
last
some
time
,
the
original
subject
seem
entirely
forget
;
and
though
Catherine
be
very
well
pleased
to
have
it
drop
for
a
while
,
she
could
not
avoid
a
little
suspicion
at
the
total
suspension
of
all
Isabella
's
impatient
desire
to
see
Mr.
Tilney
.
<EOS>
when
the
orchestra
strike
up
a
fresh
dance
,
James
would
have
lead
his
fair
partner
away
,
but
she
resist
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
Mr.
Morland
,
"
she
cry
,
"
I
would
not
do
such
a
thing
for
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
how
can
you
be
so
teasing
;
only
conceive
,
my
dear
Catherine
,
<EOS>
what
your
brother
want
me
to
do
.
<EOS>
He
want
me
to
dance
with
him
again
,
though
I
tell
him
that
it
be
a
most
improper
thing
,
and
entirely
against
the
rule
.
<EOS>
It
would
make
us
the
talk

come
along

John

walk
away

Catherine

ever
willing

give
Mr.

an
opportunity
of
repeat
the
agreeable
request
which
have
already
flatter
her
once
,
make
her
way
to
Mrs.

Mrs.

as
fast
as
she
could

in
the
hope
of
find

still
with

a
hope

when

about

"
  
<EOS>
this
inapplicable
answer
may
have
be
too
much
for
the
comprehension
of
many
;

it
do
not

Mrs.

for
after
only
a
moment

consideration

she

in

whisper
to

disappoint

<EOS>
She
seem
to
have
miss
by
so
little
<EOS>
the
very
object
she
have
have
in

;
and
this
persuasion
do
not
incline
her
to
a
very
gracious
reply
,
when
John
Thorpe
come
up
to
her
soon
afterwards
and
say
,
"

again
Catherine

herself
;

at
last

off
to

<EOS>
the
rest
of
the
evening

find
very
dull
;
Mr.
Tilney
be
draw
away
from
their
party
at
tea
,
to
attend
that
of
his
partner
;
Miss
Tilney
,
though
belong
to
it

do
not
sit
near
her

and
James

Isabella
be
so
much
engage
in
converse
together
that
the
latter
have
no
leisure
to
bestow
more
on
her
friend

one
smile

one
squeeze

"
    
<EOS>
the
progress
of
Catherine
's
unhappiness
from
the
event
of
the
evening
be
as
follow
.
<EOS>
It
appear
first
in
a
general
dissatisfaction
with
everybody
about
her
,
while
she
remain
in
the
room
,
which
speedily
bring
on
considerable
weariness
and
a
violent
desire
to
go
home
.
<EOS>
this
,
on
arrive
in
Pulteney
Street
,
take
the
direction
of
extraordinary
hunger
,
and
when
that
be
appease
,
change
into
an
earnest
longing
to
be
in
bed
;
such
be
the
extreme
point
of
her
distress
;
for
when
there
she
immediately
fall
into
a
sound
sleep
which
last
nine
hour
,
and
from
which
she
awake
perfectly
revive
,
in
excellent
spirit
,
with
fresh
hope
and
fresh
scheme
.
<EOS>
the
first
wish
of
her
heart
be
to
improve
her
acquaintance
with
Miss
Tilney
,
and
almost
her
first
resolution
,
to
seek
her
for
that
purpose
,
in
the
pump
-
room
at
noon
.
<EOS>
in
the
pump
-
room
,
one
so
newly
arrive
in
Bath
must
be
meet
with
,
and
that
building
she
have
already
find
so
favourable
for
the
discovery
of
female
excellence
,
and
the
completion
of
female
intimacy
,
so
admirably
adapt
for
secret
discourse
and
unlimited
confidence
,
that
she
be
most
reasonably
encourage
to
expect
another
friend
from
within
its
wall
.
<EOS>
Her
plan
for
the
morning
thus
settle
,
she
sit
quietly
down
to
her
book
after
breakfast
,
resolve
to
remain
in
the
same
place
and
the
same
employment
till
the
clock
strike
one
;
and
from
habitude
very
little
incommode
by
the
remark
and
ejaculation
of
Mrs.
Allen
,
whose
vacancy
of
mind
and
incapacity
for
thinking
be
such
,
that
as
she
never
talk
a
great
deal
,
so
she
could
never
be
entirely
silent
;
and
,
therefore
,
while
she
sit
at
her
work
,
if
she
lose
her
needle
or
break
her
thread
,
if
she
hear
a
carriage
in
the
street
,
or
see
a
speck
upon
her
gown
,
she
must
observe
it
aloud
,
whether
there
be
anyone
at
leisure
to
answer
her
or
not
.
<EOS>
at
about
half
past
twelve
,
a
remarkably
loud
rap
draw
her
in
haste
to
the
window
,
and
scarcely
have
she
time
to
inform
Catherine
of
there
be
two

<EOS>
Catherine
's
silent
appeal
to
her
friend
,
meanwhile
,
be
entirely
throw
away
,
for
Mrs.
Allen
,
not

habit
of
convey
any
expression
herself
by
a
look
,
be
not
aware
of
its
be
ever
intend
by
anybody
else
;
and
Catherine
,
whose
desire
of
see
Miss
Tilney
again
could
at
that
moment
bear
a
short
delay
in
favour
of
a
drive
,
and
who
think
there
could
be
no
impropriety
in
her
go
with
Mr.
Thorpe
,
as
Isabella
be
go
at
the
same
time
with
James
,
be
therefore
oblige
to
speak
plainer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well

madam

what
do
you
say
to
it
?
<EOS>
Can
you
spare
me
for

hour
or
two

Shall
I

"
  
<EOS>
"
do
just
as
you

reply
Mrs.
Allen
,
with
the
most
placid
indifference
.
<EOS>
Catherine
take
the
advice
,
and
run
off
to
get
ready
.
<EOS>
in
a
very
few
minute
she
reappear
,
have
scarcely
allow
the
two
other
time
enough
to
get
through
a
few
short
sentence
in
her
praise
,
after
Thorpe
have
procure
Mrs.
Allen
's
admiration
of
his
gig
;
and
then
receive
her
friend

part
good
wish

they
both
hurry
downstairs
.
<EOS>
"
My

creature

"
cry
Isabella
,
to
whom
the
duty
of
friendship
immediately
call
her
before
she
could
get
into
the
carriage
,
"
you
have
be
at
least
three
hour

<EOS>
I
be
afraid

ill

<EOS>
what
a
delightful
ball
we
have
last
night

<EOS>
I
have
a
thousand
thing
to

to
you

but
make
haste
and
get
in
,
for
I
long
to
be
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
follow
her
order
and
turn
away
,
but
not
too
soon
to
hear
her
friend
exclaim
aloud
to
James
,
"
what
a
sweet
girl
she
be
!
<EOS>
I
quite
dote
on
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not

frightened

Miss
Morland

Thorpe

as
he
hand
her
in
,
"
if
my
horse
should
dance
about
a
little
at
first
set
off
.
<EOS>
He
will
,
most
likely
,
give
a
plunge
or
two
,
and
perhaps
take
the
rest
for
a
minute
;
but
he
will
soon
know
his
master
.
<EOS>
He
be
full
of
spirit
,
playful
as
can
be
,
but
there
be
no
vice
in
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
do
not
think
the
portrait
a
very
inviting
one
,
but
it
be
too
late
to
retreat
,
and
she
be
too
young
to
own
herself
frightened
;
so
,
resign
herself
to
her
fate
,
and
trust
to
the
animal
's
boasted
knowledge
of
its
owner
,
she
sit
peaceably
down
,
and
see
Thorpe
sit
down
by
her
.
<EOS>
everything
be
then
arrange
,
the
servant
who
stand
at
the
horse
's
head
be
bid
in
an
important
voice
"
to
let
him
go
,
"
and
off
they
go
in
the
quiet
manner
imaginable
,
without
a
plunge
or
a
caper
,
or
anything
like
one
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
delighted
at
so
happy
an
escape
,
speak
her
pleasure
aloud
with
grateful
surprise
;
and
her
companion
immediately
make
the
matter
perfectly
simple
by
assure
her
that
it
be
entirely
owing
to
the
peculiarly
judicious
manner
in
which
he
have
then
hold
the
rein
,
and
the
singular
discernment
and
dexterity
with
which
he
have
direct
his
whip
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
though
she
could
not
help
wonder
that
with
such
perfect
command
of
his
horse
,
he
should
think
it
necessary
to
alarm
her
with
a
relation
of
its
trick
,
congratulate
herself
sincerely
on
be
under
the
care
of
so
excellent
a
coachman
;
and
perceive
that
the
animal
continue
to
go
on
in
the
same
quiet
manner
,
without
show
the
small
propensity
towards
any
unpleasant
vivacity
,
and
(
consider
its
inevitable
pace
be
ten
mile
an
hour
)
by
no
means
alarmingly
fast
,
give
herself
up
to
all
the
enjoyment
of
air
and
exercise
of
the
most
invigorating
kind
,
in
a
fine
mild
day
of
February
,
with
the
consciousness
of
safety
.
<EOS>
a
silence
of
several
minute
succeed
their
first
short
dialogue
;
it
be
break
by
Thorpe
's
say
very
abruptly
,
"
Old
Allen
be
as
rich
as
a
Jew
 
<EOS>
be
not
he
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Catherine
do
not
understand
him
 
and
he
repeat
his
question
,
add
in
explanation
,
"
Old
Allen
,
the
man
you
be
with
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Allen
,
you
mean
.
<EOS>
yes
,
I
believe
,
he
be
very
rich

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
no
child
at
all
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
 
not
any
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
famous
thing
for
his
next
heir
.
<EOS>
He
be
your
godfather
,
be
not
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
godfather
!
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
be
always
very
much
with
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
very
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
aye
,
that
be
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
He
seem
a
good
kind
of
old
fellow
enough
,
and
have
live
very
well
in
his
time
,
I
dare
say
;
he
be
not
gouty
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
do
he
drink
his
bottle
a
day
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
bottle
a
day
!
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
why
should
you
think
of
such
a
thing
?
<EOS>
He
be
a
very
temperate
man
,
and
you
could
not
fancy
him
in
liquor
last
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
help
you
!
<EOS>
You
woman
be
always
think
of
man
's
be
in
liquor
.
<EOS>
why
,
you
do
not
suppose
a
man
be
overset
by
a
bottle
?
<EOS>
I
be
sure
of
this
 
that
if
everybody
be
to
drink
their
bottle
a
day
,
there
would
not
be
half
the
disorder
in
the
world
there
be
now

<EOS>
It
would
be
a
famous
good
thing
for
us
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
believe
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Lord
,
it
would
be
the
saving
of
thousand
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
the
hundredth
part
of
the
wine
consume
in
this
kingdom
that
there
ought
to
be
.
<EOS>
Our
foggy
climate
want
help
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
yet
I
have
hear
that
there
be
a
great
deal
of
wine
drunk
in
Oxford
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oxford
!
<EOS>
there
be
no
drinking
at
Oxford
now
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
nobody
drink
there
.
<EOS>
You
would
hardly
meet
with
a
man
who
go
beyond
his
four
pint
at
the
utmost
.
<EOS>
now
,
for
instance
,
it
be
reckon
a
remarkable
thing
,
at
the
last
party
in
my
room
,
that
upon
an
average
we
clear
about
five
pint
a
head
.
<EOS>
It
be
look
upon
as
something
out
of
the
common
way
.
<EOS>
Mine
be
famous
good
stuff
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
often
meet
with
anything
like
it
in
Oxford
 
and
that
may
account
for
it
.
<EOS>
but
this
will
just
give
you
a
notion
of
the
general
rate
of
drinking
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
it
do
give
a
notion
,
"
say
Catherine
warmly
,
"
and
that
is
,
that
you
all
drink
a
great
deal
more
wine
than
I
think
you
do
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
be
sure
James
do
not
drink
so
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
declaration
bring
on
a
loud
and
overpowering
reply
,
of
which
no
part
be
very
distinct
,
except
the
frequent
exclamation
,
amount
almost
to
oath
,
which
adorn
it
,
and
Catherine
be
leave
,
when
it
end
,
with
rather
a
strengthen
belief
of
there
be
a
great
deal
of
wine
drunk
in
Oxford
,
and
the
same
happy
conviction
of
her
brother
's
comparative
sobriety
.
  
<EOS>
Thorpe
's
idea
then
all
revert
to
the
merit
of
his
own
equipage
,
and
she
be
call
on
to
admire
the
spirit
and
freedom
with
which
his
horse
move
along
,
and
the
ease
which
his
pace
,
as
well
as
the
excellence
of
the
spring
,
give
the
motion
of
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
She
follow
him
in
all
his
admiration
as
well
as
she
could
.
<EOS>
to
go
before
or
beyond
him
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
His
knowledge
and
her
ignorance
of
the
subject
,
his
rapidity
of
expression
,
and
her
diffidence
of
herself
put
that
out
of
her
power
;
she
could
strike
out
nothing
new
in
commendation
,
but
she
readily
echo
whatever
he
choose
to
assert
,
and
it
be
finally
settle
between
them
without
any
difficulty
that
his
equipage
be
altogether
the
most
complete
of
its
kind
in
England
,
his
carriage
the
neatest
,
his
horse
the
good
goer
,
and
himself
the
good
coachman
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
really
think
,
Mr.
Thorpe
,
"
say
Catherine
,
venture
after
some
time
to
consider
the
matter
as
entirely
decide
,
and
to
offer
some
little
variation
on
the
subject
,
"
that
James
's
gig
will
break
down
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
break
down
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Lord

<EOS>
do
you
ever
see
such
a
little
tittuppy
thing
in
your
life

<EOS>
there
be
not
a

piece
of
iron
about
it

<EOS>
the
wheel
have
be
fairly
wear
out
these
ten
year
at
least
 
and
as
for
the
body
!
<EOS>
upon
my
soul
,
you
may
shake
it
to
piece
yourself
with
a
touch
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
most
devilish
little
rickety
business
I
ever
beheld
!
<EOS>
thank
God
!
<EOS>
we
have
get
a
well
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
be
bind
to
go
two
mile
in
it
for
fifty
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
heaven
!
"
cry
Catherine
,
quite
frightened
.
"
<EOS>
then
pray
let
us
turn
back
;
they
will
certainly
meet
with
an
accident
if
we
go
on
.
<EOS>
do
let
us
turn
back
,
Mr.
Thorpe
;
stop
and
speak
to
my
brother
,
and
tell
him
how
very
unsafe
it
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
unsafe
!
<EOS>
oh
,
lord
!
<EOS>
what
be
there
in
that
?
<EOS>
They
will
only
get
a
roll
if
it
do
break
down
;
and
there
be
plenty
of
dirt
;
it
will
be
excellent
fall
.
<EOS>
oh
,
curse
it
!
<EOS>
the
carriage
be
safe
enough
,
if
a
man
know
how
to
drive
it
;
a
thing
of
that
sort
in
good
hand
will
last
above
twenty
year
after
it
be
fairly
wear
out
.
<EOS>
Lord
bless
you
!
<EOS>
I
would
undertake
for
five
pound
to
drive
it
to
York
and
back
again
,
without
lose
a
nail
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
listen
with
astonishment
;
she
know
not
how
to
reconcile
two
such
very
different
account
of
the
same
thing
;
for
she
have
not
be
bring
up
to
understand
the
propensity
of
a
rattle
,
nor
to
know
to
how
many
idle
assertion
and
impudent
falsehood
the
excess
of
vanity
will
lead
.
<EOS>
Her
own
family
be
plain
,
matter
-
of
-
fact
people
who
seldom
aim
at
wit
of
any
kind
;
her
father
,
at
the
utmost
,
be
content
with
a
pun
,
and
her
mother
with
a
proverb
;
they
be
not
in
the
habit
therefore
of
tell
lie
to
increase
their
importance
,
or
of
assert
at
one
moment
what
they
would
contradict
the
next
.
<EOS>
She
reflect
on
the
affair
for
some
time
in
much
perplexity
,
and
be
more
than
once
on
the
point
of
request
from
Mr.
Thorpe
a
clear
insight
into
his
real
opinion
on
the
subject
;
but
she
check
herself
,
because
it
appear
to
her
that
he
do
not
excel
in
give
those
clear
insight
,
in
make
those
thing
plain
which
he
have
before
make
ambiguous
;
and
,
join
to
this
,
the
consideration
that
he
would
not
really
suffer
his
sister
and
his
friend
to
be
expose
to
a
danger
from
which
he
may
easily
preserve
them
,
she
conclude
at
last
that
he
must
know
the
carriage
to
be
in
fact
perfectly
safe
,
and
therefore
would
alarm
herself
no
longer
.
<EOS>
by
him
the
whole
matter
seem
entirely
forget
;
and
all
the
rest
of
his
conversation
,
or
rather
talk
,
begin
and
end
with
himself
and
his
own
concern
.
<EOS>
He
tell
her
of
horse
which
he
have
buy
for
a
trifle
and
sell
for
incredible
sum
;
of
race
match
,
in
which
his
judgment
have
infallibly
foretold
the
winner
;
of
shoot
party
,
in
which
he
have
kill
more
bird
(
though
without
have
one
good
shot
)
than
all
his
companion
together
;
and
describe
to
her
some
famous
day
's
sport
,
with
the
fox
-
hound
,
in
which
his
foresight
and
skill
in
direct
the
dog
have
repair
the
mistake
of
the
most
experienced
huntsman
,
and
in
which
the
boldness
of
his
riding
,
though
it
have
never
endanger
his
own
life
for
a
moment
,
have
be
constantly
lead
other
into
difficulty
,
which
he
calmly
conclude
have
break
the
neck
of
many
.
  
<EOS>
little
as
Catherine
be
in
the
habit
of
judge
for
herself
,
and
unfixed
as
be
her
general
notion
of
what
man
ought
to
be
<EOS>
,
she
could
not
entirely
repress
a
doubt
,
while
she
bear
with
the
effusion
of
his
endless
conceit
,
of
his
be
altogether
completely
agreeable
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
bold
surmise
,
for
he
be
Isabella
's
brother
;
and
she
have
be
assure
by
James
that
his
manner
would
recommend
him
to
all
her
sex
;
but
in
spite
of
this
,
the
extreme
weariness
of
his
company
,
which
creep
over
her
before
they
have
be
out
an
hour
,
and
which
continue
unceasingly
to
increase
till
they
stop
in
Pulteney
Street
again
,
induce
her
,
in
some
small
degree
,
to
resist
such
high
authority
,
and
to
distrust
his
power
of
give
universal
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
arrive
at
Mrs.
Allen
's
door
,
the
astonishment
of
Isabella
be
hardly
to
be
express
,
on
find
that
it
be
too
late
in
the
day
for
them
to
attend
her
friend
into
the
house
:
"
<EOS>
past
three
o'clock
!
<EOS>
"
It
be
inconceivable
,
incredible
,
impossible
!
<EOS>
and
she
would
neither
believe
her
own
watch
,
nor
her
brother
's
,
nor
the
servant
be
;
she
would
believe
no
assurance
of
it
found
on
reason
or
reality
,
till
Morland
produce
his
watch
,
and
ascertain
the
fact
;
to
have
doubt
a
moment
longer
then
would
have
be
equally
inconceivable
,
incredible
,
and
impossible
;
and
she
could
only
protest
,
over
and
over
again
,
that
no
two
hour
and
a
half
have
ever
go
off
so
swiftly
before
,
as
Catherine
be
call
on
to
confirm
<EOS>
;
Catherine
could
not
tell
a
falsehood
even
to
please
Isabella
;
but
the
latter
be
spare
the
misery
of
her
friend
's
dissent
voice
,
by
not
wait
for
her
answer
.
<EOS>
Her
own
feeling
entirely
engross
her
;
her
wretchedness
be
most
acute
on
find
herself
oblige
to
go
directly
home
.
<EOS>
It
be
age
since
she
have
have
a
moment
's
conversation
with
her
dear
catherine
;
and
,
though
she
have
such
thousand
of
thing
to
say
to
her
,
it
appear
as
if
they
be
never
to
be
together
again
;
so
,
with
smile
of
most
exquisite
misery
,
and
the
laugh
eye
of
utter
despondency
,
she
bid
her
friend
adieu
and
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
find
Mrs.
Allen
just
return
from
all
the
busy
idleness
of
the
morning
,
and
be
immediately
greet
with
,
"
well
,
my
dear
,
here
you
be
,
"
a
truth
which
she
have
no
great
inclination
than
power
to
dispute
;
"
and
I
hope
you
have
have
a
pleasant
airing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

I
thank
you

we
could
not

have
a
nice
day

so
Mrs.

she
be
vastly
pleased
at
your
all
go

<EOS>
"
You
have
see
Mrs.
Thorpe
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

I
go
to
the
pump
-
room
as
soon
as
you
be
go
,
and
there
I
meet
her
,
and
we
have
a
great
deal
of
talk
together
.
<EOS>
She
say
there
be
hardly
any
veal
to
be
get
at
market
this
morning
,
it
be
so
uncommonly
scarce
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
see
anybody
else
of
our
acquaintance
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
we
agree
to
take
a
turn
in
the
Crescent
,
and
there
we
meet
Mrs.
Hughes
,
and
Mr.
and
Miss
Tilney
walk
with
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
indeed
?
<EOS>
and
do
they
speak
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
we
walk
along
the
Crescent
together
for
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
They
seem
very
agreeable
people
.
<EOS>
Miss
Tilney
be
in
a
very
pretty
spot
muslin
,
and
I
fancy
,
by
what
I
can
learn
,
that
she
always
dress
very
handsomely
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hughes
talk
to
me
a
great
deal
about
the
family
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
do
she
tell
you
of
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
a
vast
deal
indeed
;
she
hardly
talk
of
anything
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
she
tell
you
what
part
of
Gloucestershire
they
come
from
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
she
do
;
but
I
can
not
recollect
now
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
very
good
kind
of
people
,
and
very
rich
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tilney
be
a
Miss
Drummond
,
and
she
and
Mrs.
Hughes
be
schoolfellow
;
and
Miss
Drummond
have
a
very
large
fortune

,
when
she
marry

her
father
give
her
twenty
thousand

five
hundred

Mrs.

and
be
Mr.

Mrs.
Tilney
in
Bath
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
fancy
they
be
,
but
I
be
not
quite
certain

<EOS>
upon
recollection
,
however
,
I
have
a
notion
they
be
both
dead
;
at
least
the
mother
be
;
<EOS>
yes
,
I
be
sure
Mrs.
Tilney
be
dead
,
because
Mrs.
Hughes
tell
me
there
be
a
very
beautiful
set
of
pearl
that
Mr.
Drummond
give
his
daughter
on
her
wedding

day

the
only
son

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
be
quite
positive
about
that
,
my
dear

I
have
some
idea
he
be
;
but
,
however
,
he
be
a
very
fine
young
man

Mrs.
Hughes
say
,
and
likely
to
do
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
inquire
no
further
;
she
have
hear
enough
to
feel
that
Mrs.
Allen
have
no
real
intelligence
to
give
,
and
that
she
be
most
particularly
unfortunate
herself
in
have
miss
such
a
meeting
with
both
brother

sister

<EOS>
Could
she
have
foresee
such
a
circumstance
,
nothing
should
have
persuade
her
to
go
out
with
the
other
;
and
,
as
it
be
,
she
could
only
lament
her
ill
luck
,
and
think
over
what
she
have
lose
,
till
it
be
clear
to
her
that
the
drive
have
by
no
means
be
very
pleasant

that
John
Thorpe
himself
be
quite
disagreeable

<EOS>
the
Allens

Thorpes

all
meet
in
the
evening
at

theatre

and
,
as
Catherine
and
Isabella
sit
together
,
there
be
then
an
opportunity
for
the
latter
to
utter
some
few
of
the
many
thousand
thing
which
have

communication

I

not

you
all
the

I
charge
you
not

<EOS>
My

how

long
age

quite
in
love
with
you
already
;
and
as
for
Mr.
Tilney
 
<EOS>
but
that
be
a
settle
thing
 
even
your
modesty
can
not
doubt
his
attachment
now
;
<EOS>
his
come
back
to
Bath
make
it
too
plain
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
what
would
not
I
give
to
see
him
!
<EOS>
I
really
be
quite
wild
with
impatience
.
<EOS>
My
mother
say
he
be
the
most
delightful
young
man
in
the
world
;
she
see
him
this
morning
,
you
know
;
you
must
introduce
him
to
me
.
<EOS>
be
he
in
the
house
now
?
<EOS>
look
about
,
for
heaven
's
sake
!
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
I
can
hardly
exist
till
I
see
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Catherine
,
"
he
be
not
here
;
I
can
not
see
him
anywhere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
horrid
!
<EOS>
be
I
never
to
be
acquaint
with
him
?
<EOS>
how
do
you
like
my
gown
?
<EOS>
I
think
it
do
not
look
amiss
;
the
sleeve
be
entirely
my
own
thought
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
I
get
so
immoderately
sick
of
Bath
;
your
brother
and
I
be
agree
this
morning
that
,
though
it
be
vastly
well
to
be
here
for
a
few
week
,
we
would
not
live
here
for
million
.
<EOS>
We
soon
find
out
that
our
taste
be
exactly
alike
in
prefer
the
country
to
every
other
place
;
really
,
our
opinion
be
so
exactly
the
same
,
it
be
quite
ridiculous
!
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
single
point
in
which
we
differ
;
I
would
not
have
have
you
by
for
the
world
;
you
be
such
a
sly
thing
,
I
be
sure
you
would
have
make
some
droll
remark
or
other
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
I
should
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
you
would
indeed
;
I
know
you
better
than
you
know
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
tell
us
that
we
seem
bear
for
each
other
,
or
some
nonsense
of
that
kind
,
which
would
have
distress
me
beyond
conception
;
my
cheek
would
have
be
as
red
as
your
rose
;
I
would
not
have
have
you
by
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
you
do
me
injustice
;
I
would
not
have
make
so
improper
a
remark
upon
any
account
;
and
besides
,
I
be
sure
it
would
never
have
enter
my
head
.

"
  
<EOS>
Isabella
smile
incredulously
and
talk
the
rest
of
the
evening
to
James
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
's
resolution
of
endeavour
to
meet
Miss
Tilney
again
continue
in
full
force
the
next
morning
;
and
till
the
usual
moment
of
go
to
the
pump
-
room
,
she
feel
some
alarm
from
the
dread
of
a
second
prevention
.
<EOS>
but
nothing
of
that
kind
occur
,
no
visitor
appear
to
delay
them
,
and
they
all
three
set
off
in
good
time
for
the
pump
-
room
,
where
the
ordinary
course
of
event
and
conversation
take
place
;
Mr.
Allen
,
after
drink
his
glass
of
water
,
join
some
gentleman
to
talk
over
the
politic
of
the
day
and
compare
the
account
of
their
newspaper
;
and
the
lady
walk
about
together
,
notice
every
new
face
,
and
almost
every
new
bonnet
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
the
female
part
of
the
Thorpe
family
,
attend
by
James
Morland
,
appear
among
the
crowd
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
Catherine
immediately
take
her
usual
place
by
the
side
of
her
friend
.
<EOS>
James
,
who
be
now
in
constant
attendance
,
maintain
a
similar
position
,
and
separate
themselves
from
the
rest
of
their
party
,
they
walk
in
that
manner
for
some
time
,
till
Catherine
begin
to
doubt
the
happiness
of
a
situation
which
,
confine
her
entirely
to
her
friend
and
brother
,
give
her
very
little
share
in
the
notice
of
either
.
<EOS>
They
be
always
engage
in
some
sentimental
discussion
or
lively
dispute
,
but
their
sentiment
be
convey
in
such
whispering
voice
,
and
their
vivacity
attend
with
so
much
laughter
,
that
though
Catherine
's
support
opinion
be
not
unfrequently
call
for
by
one
or
the
other
,
she
be
never
able
to
give
any
,
from
not
have
hear
a
word
of
the
subject
.
<EOS>
at
length
however
she
be
empower
to
disengage
herself
from
her
friend
,
by
the
avow
necessity
of
speak
to
Miss
Tilney
,
whom
she
most
joyfully
see
just
enter
the
room
with
Mrs.
Hughes
,
and
whom
she
instantly
join
,
with
a
firm
determination
to
be
acquaint
,
than
she
may
have
have
courage
to
command
,
have
she
not
be
urge
by
the
disappointment
of
the
day
before
.
<EOS>
Miss
Tilney
meet
her
with
great
civility
,
return
her
advance
with
equal
goodwill
,
and
they
continue
talk
together
as
long
as
both
party
remain
in
the
room
;
and
though
in
all
probability
not
an
observation
be
make
,
nor
an
expression
use
by
either
which
have
not
be
make
and
use
some
thousand
of
time
before
,
under
that
roof
,
in
every
Bath
season
,
yet
the
merit
of
their
be
speak
with
simplicity
and
truth
,
and
without
personal
conceit
,
may
be
something
uncommon
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
well
your
brother
dance
!
<EOS>
"
be
an
artless
exclamation
of
Catherine
's
towards
the
close
of
their
conversation
,
which
at
once
surprised
and
amuse
her
companion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Henry
!
"
<EOS>
she
reply
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
he
do
dance
very
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
must
have
think
it
very
odd
to
hear
me
say
I
be
engage
the
other
evening
,
when
he
see
me
sit
down
.
<EOS>
but
I
really
have
be
engage
the
whole
day
to
Mr.
Thorpe
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Tilney
could
only
bow
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
think
,
"
add
Catherine
after
a
moment
's
silence
,
"
how
surprised
I
be
to
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
I
feel
so
sure
of
his
be
quite
go
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
when
Henry
have
the
pleasure
of
see
you
before
,
he
be
in
Bath
but
for
a
couple
of
day
.
<EOS>
He
come
only
to
engage
lodging
for
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
never
occur
to
me
;
and
of
course
,
not
see
him
anywhere
<EOS>
,
I
think
he
must
be
go
.
<EOS>
be
not
the
young
lady
he
dance
with
on
Monday
a
Miss
Smith
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
an
acquaintance
of
Mrs.
Hughes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
she
be
very
glad
to
dance
.
<EOS>
do
you
think
her
pretty
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
very
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
never
come
to
the
pump
-
room
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
,
sometimes
;
but
he
have
rid
out
this
morning
with
my
father
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hughes
now
join
them
,
and
ask
Miss
Tilney
if
she
be
ready
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
see
you
again
soon
,
"
say
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
you
be
at
the
cotillion
ball
tomorrow
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
we
 
<EOS>
yes
,
I
think
we
certainly
shall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
of
it
,
for
we
shall
all
be
there
.
"
<EOS>
this
civility
be
duly
return
;
and
they
part
 
on
Miss
Tilney
's
side
with
some
knowledge
of
her
new
acquaintance
's
feeling
,
and
on
Catherine
's
,
without
the
small
consciousness
of
have
explain
them
.
  
<EOS>
She
go
home
very
happy
.
<EOS>
the
morning
have
answer
all
her
hope
,
and
the
evening
of
the
follow
day
be
now
the
object
of
expectation
,
the
future
good
.
<EOS>
what
gown
and
what
head
-
dress
she
should
wear
on
the
occasion
become
her
chief
concern
.
<EOS>
She
can
not
be
justify
in
it
.
<EOS>
Dress
be
at
all
time
a
frivolous
distinction
,
and
excessive
solicitude
about
it
often
destroy
its
own
aim
.
<EOS>
Catherine
know
all
this
very
well
;
her
great
aunt
have
read
her
a
lecture
on
the
subject
only
the
Christmas
before
;
and
yet
she
lie
awake
ten
minute
on
Wednesday
night
debate
between
her
spot
and
her
tamboure
muslin
,
and
<EOS>
nothing
but
the
shortness
of
the
time
prevent
her
buy
a
new
one
for
the
evening
.
<EOS>
this
would
have
be
an
error
in
judgment
,
great
though
not
uncommon
,
from
which
one
of
the
other
sex
rather
than
her
own
,
a
brother
rather
than
a
great
aunt
,
may
have
warn
her
,
for
man
only
can
be
aware
of
the
insensibility
of
man
towards
a
new
gown
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
mortify
to
the
feeling
of
many
lady
,
could
they
be
make
to
understand
how
little
the
heart
of
man
be
affect
by
what
be
costly
or
new
in
their
attire
;
how
little
it
be
bias
by
the
texture
of
their
muslin
,
and
how
unsusceptible
of
peculiar
tenderness
towards
the
spot
,
the
sprig
,
the
mull
,
or
the
jackonet
.
<EOS>
woman
be
fine
for
her
own
satisfaction
alone
.
<EOS>
no
man
will
admire
her
the
more
,
no
woman
will
like
her
the
well
for
it
.
<EOS>
neatness
and
fashion
be
enough
for
the
former
,
and
a
something
of
shabbiness
or
impropriety
will
be
most
endearing
to
the
latter
.
<EOS>
but
not
one
of
these
grave
reflection
trouble
the
tranquillity
of
Catherine
.
  
<EOS>
She
enter
the
room
on
Thursday
evening
with
feeling
very
different
from
what
have
attend
her
thither
the
Monday
before
.
<EOS>
She
have
then
be
exult
in
her
engagement
to
Thorpe
,
and
be
now
chiefly
anxious
to
avoid
his
sight
,
lest
he
should
engage
her
again
;
for
though
she
could
not
,
dare
not
expect
that
Mr.
Tilney
should
ask
her
a
third
time
to
dance
,
her
wish
,
hope
,
and
plan
all
centre
in
nothing
less
.
<EOS>
every
young
lady
may
feel
for
my
heroine
in
this
critical
moment
,
for
every
young
lady
have
at
some
time
or
other
know
the
same
agitation
.
<EOS>
all
have
be
,
or
at
least
all
have
believe
themselves
to
be
,
in
danger
from
the
pursuit
of
someone
whom
they
wish
to
avoid
;
and
all
have
be
anxious
for
the
attention
of
someone
whom
they
wish
to
please
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
be
join
by
the
Thorpes
,
Catherine
's
agony
begin
;
she
fidget
about
if
John
Thorpe
come
towards
her
,
hide
herself
as
much
as
possible
from
his
view
,
and
when
he
speak
to
her
pretend
not
to
hear
him
.
<EOS>
the
cotillion
be
over
,
the
country
-
dancing
beginning
,
and
she
see
nothing
of
the
Tilneys
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
be
frightened
,
my
dear
catherine
,
"
whisper
Isabella
,
"
but
I
be
really
go
to
dance
with
your
brother
again
.
<EOS>
I
declare
positively
it
be
quite
shocking
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
,
but
you
and
John
must
keep
us
in
countenance
.
<EOS>
make
haste
,
my
dear
creature
,
and
come
to
us
.
<EOS>
John
be
just
walk
off
,
but
he
will
be
back
in
a
moment
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
have
neither
time
nor
inclination
to
answer
.
<EOS>
the
other
walk
away
,
John
Thorpe
be
still
in
view
,
and
she
give
herself
up
for
lose
.
<EOS>
that
she
may
not
appear
,
however
,
to
observe
or
expect
him
,
she
keep
her
eye
intently
fix
on
her
fan
;
and
a
self
-
condemnation
for
her
folly
,
in
suppose
that
among
such
a
crowd
they
should
even
meet
with
the
Tilneys
in
any
reasonable
time
,
have
just
pass
through
her
mind
,
when
she
suddenly
find
herself
address
and
again
solicit
to
dance
,
by
Mr.
Tilney
himself
.
<EOS>
with
what
sparkle
eye
and
ready
motion
she
grant
his
request
,
and
with
how
please
a
flutter
of
heart
she
go
with
him
to
the
set
,
may
be
easily
imagine
.
<EOS>
to
escape
,
and
,
as
she
believe
,
so
narrowly
escape
John
Thorpe
,
and
to
be
ask
,
so
immediately
on
his
join
her
,
ask
by
Mr.
Tilney
,
as
if
he
have
seek
her
on
purpose
!
 
<EOS>
it
do
not
appear
to
her
that
life
could
supply
any
great
felicity
.
  
<EOS>
scarcely
have
they
work
themselves
into
the
quiet
possession
of
a
place
,
however
,
when
her
attention
be
claim
by
John
Thorpe
,
who
stand
behind
her
.
"
<EOS>
Heyday
,
Miss
Morland
!
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
meaning
of
this
?
<EOS>
I
think
you
and
I
be
to
dance
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
you
should
think
so
,
for
you
never
ask
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
good
one
,
by
Jove
!
<EOS>
I
ask
you
as
soon
as
I
come
into
the
room
,
and
I
be
just
go
to
ask
you
again
,
<EOS>
but
when
I
turn
round
,
you
be
go
!
<EOS>
this
be
a
curse
shabby
trick
!
<EOS>
I
only
come
for
the
sake
of
dance
with
you
,
and
I
firmly
believe
you
be
engage
to
me
ever
since
Monday
.
<EOS>
yes
;
I
remember
,
I
ask
you
while
you
be
wait
in
the
lobby
for
your
cloak

and
here
have
I
be
tell
all
my
acquaintance
that
I
be
go
to
dance
with
the
pretty
girl
in
the
room
;
and
when
they
see
you
stand
up
with
somebody
else
,
they
will
quiz
me
famously
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
;
they
will
never
think
of
me
,
after
such
a
description
as
that
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
by
heaven
,
if
they
do
not
,
I
will
kick
them
out
of
the
room
for
blockhead

what
chap
have
you
there
?

<EOS>
Catherine
satisfy
his
curiosity

he
repeat

Hum

I
do
not

him

a
good
figure
of
a
man

well
put
together

<EOS>
do
he
want
a
horse

<EOS>
here
be
a
friend

one

anybody

clever
animal

road
 
only
forty
guinea

I
have
fifty
mind

buy
it
myself

for
it
be
one
of
my
maxim
always
to
buy
a
good
horse
when
I
meet
with
one
;
but
it
would
not
answer
my
purpose

it
would
not
do
for
the
field

I
would
give
any
money
for
a
real
good
hunter
.
<EOS>
I
have
three
now
,
the
good
that
ever
be
back
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
take
eight
hundred
guinea
for
them
.
<EOS>
fletcher
and
<EOS>
I
mean
to
get
a
house
in
Leicestershire
,
against
the
next
season
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
d
 
<EOS>
uncomfortable
,
live
at
an
inn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
last
sentence
by
which
he
could
weary
Catherine
's
attention
,
for
he
be
just
then
bear
off
by
the
resistless
pressure
of
a
long
string
of
pass
lady
.
<EOS>
Her
partner
now
draw
near
,
and
say
,
"
that
gentleman
would
have
put
me
out
of
patience
,
have
he
stay
with
you
half
a
minute
longer
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
business
to
withdraw
the
attention
of
my
partner
from
me
.
<EOS>
We
have
enter
into
a
contract
of
mutual
agreeableness
for
the
space
of
an
evening
,
and
all
our
agreeableness
belong
solely
to
each
other
for
that
time
.
<EOS>
nobody
can
fasten
themselves
on
the
notice
of
one
,
without
injure
the
right
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
consider
a
country
-
dance
as
an
emblem
of
marriage
.
<EOS>
Fidelity
and
complaisance
be
the
principal
duty
of
both
;
and
those
man
who
do
not
choose
to
dance
or
marry
themselves
,
have
no
business
with
the
partner
or
wife
of
their
neighbour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
they
be
such
very
different
thing
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
 
that
you
think
they
can
not
be
compare
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
to
be
sure
not
.
<EOS>
People
that
marry
can
never
part
,
but
must
go
and
keep
house
together
.
<EOS>
People
that
dance
only
stand
opposite
each
other
in
a
long
room
for
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
such
be
your
definition
of
matrimony
and
dancing
.
<EOS>
take
in
that
light
certainly
,
their
resemblance
be
not
strike
;
but
I
think
I
could
place
them
in
such
a
view
.
<EOS>
You
will
allow
,
that
in
both
,
man
have
the
advantage
of
choice
,
woman
only
the
power
of
refusal
;
that
in
both
,
it
be
an
engagement
between
man
and
woman
,
form
for
the
advantage
of
each
;
and
that
when
once
enter
into
,
they
belong
exclusively
to
each
other
till
the
moment
of
its
dissolution
;
that
it
be
their
duty
,
each
to
endeavour
to
give
the
other
no
cause
for
wish
that
he
or
she
have
bestow
themselves
elsewhere
,
and
their
good
interest
to
keep
their
own
imagination
from
wander
towards
the
perfection
of
their
neighbour
,
or
fancy
that
they
should
have
be
well
off
with
anyone
else
.
<EOS>
You
will
allow
all
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
to
be
sure
,
as
you
state
it
,
all
this
sound
very
well
;
but
still
they
be
so
very
different
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
look
upon
them
at
all
in
the
same
light
,
nor
think
the
same
duty
belong
to
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
one
respect
,
there
certainly
be
a
difference
.
<EOS>
in
marriage
,
the
man
be
suppose
to
provide
for
the
support
of
the
woman
,
the
woman
to
make
the
home
agreeable
to
the
man
;
he
be
to
purvey
,
and
she
be
to
smile
.
<EOS>
but
in
dancing
,
their
duty
be
exactly
change
;
the
agreeableness
,
the
compliance
be
expect
from
him
,
while
she
furnish
the
fan
and
the
lavender
water
.
<EOS>
that
,
I
suppose
,
be
the
difference
of
duty
which
strike
you
,
as
render
the
condition
incapable
of
comparison
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
,
I
never
think
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
be
quite
at
a
loss
.
<EOS>
one
thing
,
however
,
I
must
observe
.
<EOS>
this
disposition
on
your
side
be
rather
alarming
.
<EOS>
You
totally
disallow
any
similarity
in
the
obligation
;
and
may
I
not
thence
infer
that
your
notion
of
the
duty
of
the
dancing
state
be
not
so
strict
as
your
partner
may
wish
?
<EOS>
have
I
not
reason
to
fear
that
if
the
gentleman
who
speak
to
you
just
now
be
to
return
,
or
if
any
other
gentleman
be
to
address
you
,
there
would
be
nothing
to
restrain
you
from
converse
with
him
as
long
as
you
choose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Thorpe
be
such
a
very
particular
friend
of
my
brother
's
,
that
if
he
talk
to
me
,
I
must
talk
to
him
again
;
but
there
be
hardly
three
young
man
in
the
room
besides
him
that
I
have
any
acquaintance
with
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
be
that
to
be
my
only
security
?
<EOS>
alas
,
alas
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
I
be
sure
you
can
not
have
a
well
;
for
if
I
do
not
know
anybody
,
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
talk
to
them
;
and
,
besides
,
I
do
not
want
to
talk
to
anybody
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
now
you
have
give
me
a
security
worth
have
;
and
I
shall
proceed
with
courage
.
<EOS>
do
you
find
Bath
as
agreeable
as
when
I
have
the
honour
of
make
the
inquiry
before
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
quite
 
more
so
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
more
so
!
<EOS>
take
care
,
or
you
will
forget
to
be
tired
of
it
at
the
proper
time
.
<EOS>
You
ought
to
be
tired
at
the
end
of
six
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
I
should
be
tired
,
if
I
be
to
stay
here
six
month
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Bath
,
compare
with
London
,
have
little
variety
,
and
so
everybody
find
out
every
year
.
<EOS>
"
for
six
week
,
I
allow
Bath
be
pleasant
enough
;
but
beyond
that
,
it
be
the
most
tiresome
place
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
be
tell
so
by
people
of
all
description
,
who
come
regularly
every
winter
,
lengthen
their
six
week
into
ten
or
twelve
,
and
go
away
at
last
because
they
can
afford
to
stay
no
longer
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
other
people
must
judge
for
themselves
,
and
those
who
go
to
London
may
think
nothing
of
Bath
.
<EOS>
but
I
,
who
live
in
a
small
retired
village
in
the
country
,
can
never
find
great
sameness
in
such
a
place
as
this
than
in
my
own
home
;
for
here
be
a
variety
of
amusement
,
a
variety
of
thing
to
be
see
and
do
all
day
long
,
which
I
can
know
nothing
of
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
fond
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
be
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
live
there
,
and
always
be
very
happy
.
<EOS>
but
certainly
there
be
much
more
sameness
in
a
country
life
than
in
a
Bath
life
.
<EOS>
one
day
in
the
country
be
exactly
like
another
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
then
you
spend
your
time
so
much
more
rationally
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
there
be
much
difference

<EOS>
"
here
you
be
in
pursuit
only
of
amusement
all
day
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
I
be
at
home
 
<EOS>
only
I
do
not
find
so
much
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
walk
about
here
,
and
so
I
do
there
;
<EOS>
but
here
I
see
a
variety
of
people
in
every
street
,
and
there
I
can
only
go
and
call
on
Mrs.
Allen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tilney
be
very
much
amuse
.
  
<EOS>
"
only
go
and
call
on
Mrs.
Allen
!
"
<EOS>
he
repeat
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
a
picture
of
intellectual
poverty
!
<EOS>
however
,
when
you
sink
into
this
abyss
again
,
you
will
have
more
to
say
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
able
to
talk
of
Bath
,
and
of
all
that
you
do
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
be
in
want
of
something
to
talk
of
again
to
Mrs.
Allen
,
or
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
I
really
believe
I
shall
always
be
talk
of
Bath
,
when
I
be
at
home
again
 
<EOS>
I
do
like
it
so
very
much
.
<EOS>
if
I
could
but
have
Papa
and
Mamma
,
and
the
rest
of
them
here
,
I
suppose
I
should
be
too
happy
!
<EOS>
James
's
come
(
my
eld
brother
)
be
quite
delightful
 
and
especially
as
it
turn
out
that
the
very
family
we
be
just
get
so
intimate
with
be
his
intimate
friend
already
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
who
can
ever
be
tired
of
Bath
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
those
who
bring
such
fresh
feeling
of
every
sort
to
it
as
you
do
.
<EOS>
but
papas
and
mamma
,
and
brother
,
and
intimate
friend
be
a
good
deal
go
by
,
to
most
of
the
frequenter
of
Bath
 
and
the
honest
relish
of
ball
and
play
,
and
everyday
sight
,
be
past
with
them
.
<EOS>
"
here
their
conversation
close
,
the
demand
of
the
dance
become
now
too
importunate
for
a
divided
attention
.
  
<EOS>
soon
after
their
reach
the
bottom
of
the
set
,
Catherine
perceive
herself
to
be
earnestly
regard
by
a
gentleman
who
stand
among
the
looker
-
on
,
immediately
behind
her
partner
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
very
handsome
man
,
of
a
command
aspect
,
past
the
bloom
,
but
not
past
the
vigour
of
life
;
and
with
his
eye
still
direct
towards
her
,
she
see
him
presently
address
Mr.
Tilney
in
a
familiar
whisper
.
<EOS>
confuse
by
his
notice
,
and
blush
from
the
fear
of
its
be
excite
by
something
wrong
in
her
appearance
,
she
turn
away
her
head
.
<EOS>
but
while
she
do
so
,
the
gentleman
retreat
,
and
her
partner
,
come
nearer
,
say
,
"
I
see
that
you
guess
what
I
have
just
be
ask
.
<EOS>
that
gentleman
know
your
name

you
have
a
right
to
know
his

<EOS>
It
be
General
Tilney

my
father

"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
's
answer
be
only
"
oh
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
an
"
oh
!
"
express
everything
needful
:
attention
to
his
word

perfect
reliance
on
their
truth

<EOS>
with
real
interest
and
strong
admiration
do
her
eye
now
follow
the
general

as
he
move
through
the
crowd
,
and
"
how
handsome
a
family
they
be

be
her
secret
remark

in

felicity

She
have
never

her
arrival

Miss
Tilney
,
to
whom
all
the
commonly
frequent
environ
be
familiar
,
speak
of
them
in
term
which
make
her
all
eagerness
to
know
them
too
;
and
on
her
openly
fear
that
she
may
find
nobody
to
go
with
her

it
be
propose
by
the
brother

sister
that
they
should
join
in
a
walk

some
morning
or
other

"
I
shall
like
it

beyond
anything

put
it
off

us
go
tomorrow

this
be
readily
agree
to

with
only
a
proviso
of
Miss
Tilney
's
,
that
it
do
not
rain
,
which
Catherine
be
sure
it
would
not

<EOS>
at
twelve
o'clock
,
they
be
to
call
for
her
in
Pulteney
Street
;

remember
 
twelve
o'clock

her
part

to
her
new

her
more
established

fidelity

yet
,
though
longing
to
make

she
cheerfully
submit
to
the
wish
of
Mr.

which
take
them
rather
early
away
,
and
her
spirit
dance
within
her
,
as
she

chair
all
the
way
home

<EOS>
the
morrow
bring
a
very
sober

look

sun
make
only
a
few
effort
to
appear

Catherine
augur
from
it
everything
most
favourable

her
wish

<EOS>
a
bright
morning
so
early
in
the
year
,
she
allow

would
generally
turn
to
rain

a
cloudy
one
foretold
improvement

no

fine
day

go
off

sun
keep
out

<EOS>
at
about
eleven
o'clock

however
,
a
few
speck
of
small
rain
upon
the
window
catch
Catherine

watchful
eye
,
and
<EOS>
"
oh
!
<EOS>
dear
,
I
do
believe
it
will
be
wet

from
her
in

most
desponding
tone

I
think
how
it
would
be

Mrs.
Allen

"
no
walk
for
me
today

perhaps
it
may
come
to
nothing

it
may
hold
up
before
twelve

perhaps
it
may

then
,
my

be
so
dirty

she

over

encourage

<EOS>
ten
minute
more
make
it
certain
that
a
bright

would
succeed

have

always

up

whether

whether

dirty
the

it

ankle

deep
everywhere

<EOS>
Isabella
corroborate
it
:
"
My

you
can

come

can

go
now

<EOS>
"
I

yes

by

by

make
yourself
easy

there

<EOS>
Catherine
's
feeling
,
as
she
get
into
the
carriage
,
be
in
a
very
unsettled
state
;
divide
between
regret
for
the
loss
of
one
great
pleasure
,
and
the
hope
of
soon
enjoy
another
,
almost
its
equal
in
degree
,
however
unlike
in
kind
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
think
the
Tilneys
have
act
quite
well
by
her
,
in
so
readily
give
up
their
engagement
,
without
send
her
any
message
of
excuse
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
but
an
hour
later
than
the
time
fix
on
for
the
beginning
of
their
walk
;
and
,
in
spite
of
what
she
have
hear
of
the
prodigious
accumulation
of
dirt
in
the
course
of
that
hour
,
she
could
not
from
her
own
observation
help
think
that
they
may
have
go
with
very
little
inconvenience
.
<EOS>
to
feel
herself
slight
by
them
be
very
painful
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
the
delight
of
explore
an
edifice
like
Udolpho
,
as
her
fancy
represent
Blaize
Castle
to
be
,
be
such
a
counterpoise
of
good
as
may
console
her
for
almost
anything
.
  
<EOS>
They
pass
briskly
down
Pulteney
Street
,
and
through
Laura
Place
,
without
the
exchange
of
many
word
.
<EOS>
Thorpe
talk
to
his
horse
,
and
she
meditate
,
by
turn
,
on
broken
promise
and
break
arch
,
phaeton
and
false
hanging
,
tilney
and
trap
-
door

<EOS>
as
they
enter
Argyle
Buildings
,
however
,
she
be
rouse
by
this
address
from
her
companion
,
<EOS>

be
that
girl

at
you

hard

where

on

right

out

Catherine
look
round
and
see
Miss
Tilney
lean
on
her
brother
's
arm
,
walk
slowly
down
the
street

She
see
them
both
look
back
at
her
.
<EOS>
"
stop
,
stop

she
impatiently
cry
;
"

indeed

you
tell
me
they
be
go

stop
,

will
get
out
this
moment

go
to
them

<EOS>
but
to
what
purpose
do
she
speak
?
<EOS>
Thorpe
only
lash
his
horse
into
a
brisker
trot
;
the
Tilneys
,
who
have
soon
cease
to
look
after
her
,
be
in
a
moment
out
of
sight
<EOS>
round
the
corner
of
Laura
Place
,
and
in
another
moment
she
be
herself
whisk
into
the
marketplace
.
<EOS>
still
,
however
,
and
during
the
length
of
another
street
,
she
entreat
him
to
stop
.
<EOS>
"
pray
,
pray
stop

I
will
not

on

I
must
go
back
to
Miss
Tilney

"
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Thorpe
only
laugh
,
smack
his
whip
,
encourage
his
horse
,
make
odd
noise
,
and
drive
on
;
and
Catherine
,
angry
and
vexed
as
she
be
,
have
no
power
of
get
away
<EOS>
,
be
oblige
to
give
up
the
point
and
submit
.
<EOS>
Her
reproach
,
however
,
be
not
spare
.
<EOS>
"
how
could
you
deceive
me
so
,
Mr.
Thorpe
?
<EOS>
how
could
you
say
that
you
see
them
drive
up
the
Lansdown
Road
?
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
have
it
happen
so
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
They
must
think
it
so
strange
,
so
rude
of
me
!
<EOS>
to
go
by
them
,
too
,
without
say
a
word
!
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
how
vexed
I
be
;
I
shall
have
no
pleasure
at
Clifton
,
nor
in
anything
else
.
<EOS>
I
have
rather
,
ten
thousand
time
rather
,
get
out
now
,
and
walk
back
to
them
.
<EOS>
how
could
you
say
you
see
them
drive
out
in
a
phaeton
?
<EOS>
"
Thorpe
defend
himself
very
stoutly
,
declare
he
have
never
see
two
man
so
much
alike
in
his
life
,
and
would
hardly
give
up
the
point
of
its
have
be
Tilney
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Their
drive
,
even
when
this
subject
be
over
,
be
not
likely
to
be
very
agreeable
.
<EOS>
Catherine
's
complaisance
be
no
longer
what
it
have
be
in
their
former
airing
.
<EOS>
She
listen
reluctantly
,
and
her
reply
be
short
.
<EOS>
Blaize
Castle
remain
her
only
comfort
;
towards
that
,
she
still
look
at
interval
with
pleasure
;
though
rather
than
be
disappoint
of
the
promised
walk
,
and
especially
rather
than
be
think
ill
of
by
the
Tilneys
,
she
would
willingly
have
give
up
all
the
happiness
which
its
wall
could
supply
 
the
happiness
of
a
progress
through
a
long
suite
of
lofty
room
,
exhibit
the
remain
of
magnificent
furniture
,
though
now
for
many
year
desert
 
<EOS>
the
happiness
of
be
stop
in
their
way
along
narrow
,
wind
vault
,
by
a
low
,
grate
door
;
or
even
of
have
their
lamp
,
their
only
lamp
,
extinguish
by
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
,
and
of
be
leave
in
total
darkness
.
<EOS>
in
the
meanwhile
,
they
proceed
on
their
journey
without
any
mischance
,
and
be
within
view
of
the
town
of
Keynsham
,
when
a
halloo
from
Morland
,
who
be
behind
them
,
make
his
friend
pull
up
,
to
know
what
be
the
matter

<EOS>
the
other
then
come
close
enough
for
conversation
,
and
Morland
say
,
"
We
have
better
go
back

Thorpe

it
be
too
late
to
go
on
today

Pulteney
Street
,
very
little
more
than
seven
mile
;
and
,
I
suppose
,
we
have
at
least
eight
more
to
go
.
<EOS>
It
will
never
do
.
<EOS>
We
set
out
a
great
deal
too
late
.
<EOS>
We
have
much
better
put
it
off
till
another
day
,
and
turn
round
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
one
to
me
,
"
reply
Thorpe
rather
angrily
;
and
instantly
turn
his
horse
,
they
be
on
their
way
back
to
Bath
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
your
brother
have
not
get
such
a
d
 
beast
to
drive
,
"
say
he
soon
afterwards
,
"
we
may
have
do
it
very
well
.
<EOS>
My
horse
would
have
trot
to
Clifton
within
the
hour
,
if
leave
to
himself
,
and
I
have
almost
break
my
arm
with
pull
him
in
to
that
curse
break
-
winded
jade
's
pace
.
<EOS>
morland
be
a
fool
for
not
keep
a
horse
and
gig
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
he
be
not
,
"
say
Catherine
warmly
,
"
for
I
be
sure
he
could
not
afford
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
why
can
not
he
afford
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
he
have
not
money
enough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
whose
fault
be
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
nobody
be
,
that
I
know
of
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thorpe
then
say
something
in
the
loud
,
incoherent
way
to
which
he
have
often
recourse
,
about
its
be
a
d
 
thing
to
be
miserly
;
and
that
if
people
who
roll
in
money
could
not
afford
thing
,
he
do
not
know
who
could
,
which
Catherine
do
not
even
endeavour
to
understand
.
<EOS>
disappoint
of
what
be
to
have
be
the
consolation
for
her
first
disappointment
,
she
be
less
and
less
disposed
either
to
be
agreeable
herself
or
to
find
her
companion
so
;
and
they
return
to
Pulteney
Street
without
her
speak
twenty
word
.
  
<EOS>
as
she
enter
the
house
,
the
footman
tell
her
that
a
gentleman
and
lady
have
call
and
inquire
for
her
a
few
minute
after
her
set
off
;
that
,
when
he
tell
them
she
be
go
out
with
Mr.
Thorpe
,
the
lady
have
ask
whether
any
message
have
be
leave
for
her
;
and
on
his
say
no
,
have
feel
for
a
card
,
but
say
she
have
none
about
her
,
and
go
away
.
<EOS>
ponder
over
these
heart
-
rend
tiding
,
Catherine
walk
slowly
upstairs
.
<EOS>
at
the
head
of
them
she
be
meet
by
Mr.
Allen
,
who
,
on
hear
the
reason
of
their
speedy
return
,
say
,
"
I
be
glad
your
brother
have
so
much
sense
;
I
be
glad
you
be
come
back
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
strange
,
wild
scheme
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
all
spend
the
evening
together
at
Thorpe
's
.
<EOS>
Catherine
be
disturb
and
out
of
spirit
;
but
Isabella
seem
to
find
a
pool
of
commerce
,
in
the
fate
of
which
she
share
,
by
private
partnership
with
Morland
,
a
very
good
equivalent
for
the
quiet
and
country
air
of
an
inn
at
Clifton
.
<EOS>
Her
satisfaction
,
too
,
in
not
be
at
the
Lower
Rooms
be
speak
more
than
once
.
<EOS>
"
how
I
pity
the
poor
creature
that
be
go
there
!
<EOS>
how
glad
I
be
that
I
be
not
amongst
them
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
it
will
be
a
full
ball
or
not
!
<EOS>
They
have
not
begin
dance
yet
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
be
there
for
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
delightful
to
have
an
evening
now
<EOS>
and
then
to
oneself
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
it
will
not
be
a
very
good
ball
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
Mitchells
will
not
be
there
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
pity
everybody
that
be
.
<EOS>
but
I
dare
say
,
Mr.
Morland
,
you
long
to
be
at
it
,
do
not
you
?
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
do
.
<EOS>
well
,
pray
do
not
let
anybody
here
be
a
restraint
on
you
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
we
could
do
very
well
without
you
;
but
you
man
think
yourself
of
such
consequence
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
could
almost
have
accuse
Isabella
of
be
want
in
tenderness
towards
herself
and
her
sorrow
,
so
very
little
<EOS>
do
they
appear
to
dwell
on
her
mind
,
and
so
very
inadequate
be
the
comfort
she
offer
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
be
so
dull
,
my
dear
creature
,
"
she
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
quite
break
my
heart
.
<EOS>
It
be
amazingly
shocking
,
to
be
sure
;
but
the
Tilneys
be
entirely
to
blame
.
<EOS>
why
be
not
they
more
punctual
?
<EOS>
It
be
dirty
,
indeed
,
but
what
do
that
signify
?
<EOS>
I
be
sure
John
and
I
should
not
have
mind
it
.
<EOS>
I
never
mind
go
through
anything
,
where
a
friend
be
concern
;
that
be
my
disposition
,
and
John
be
just
the
same

he
have
amazing
strong
feeling

<EOS>
good
heaven
!
<EOS>
what
a
delightful
hand
you
have

<EOS>
king

I
vow
!
<EOS>
I
never
be
so
happy
in
my
life

<EOS>
I
would
fifty
time
rather
you
should
have
them
than
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
now
I
may
dismiss
my
heroine
to
the
sleepless
couch
,
which
be
the
true
heroine
's
portion
;
to
a
pillow
strew
with
thorn
and
wet
with
tear
.
<EOS>
and
lucky
may
she
think
herself
,
if
she
get
another
good
night
's
rest
in
the
course
of
the
next
three
month

<EOS>
"
Mrs.

Catherine
the
next
morning

will
there
be
any
harm

my

white

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
cheerfully
comply
,
and
be
properly
equip
,
be
more
impatient
than
ever
to
be
at
the
pump
-
room
,
that
she
may
inform
herself
of
General
Tilney
's
lodging
,
for
though
she
believe
they
be
in
Milsom
Street
,
she
be
not
certain
of
the
house
,
and
Mrs.
Allen
's
wavering
conviction
only
make
it
more
doubtful
.
<EOS>
to
Milsom
Street
she
be
direct
,
and
have
make
herself
perfect
in
the
number
,
hasten
away
with
eager
step
and
a
beat
heart
to
pay
her
visit
,
explain
her
conduct
,
and
be
forgive
;
trip
lightly
through
the
church
-
yard
,
and
resolutely
turn
away
her
eye
,
that
she
may
not
be
oblige
to
see
her
beloved
Isabella
and
her
dear
family
<EOS>
,
who
,
she
have
reason
to
believe
,
be
in
a
shop
hard
by
.
<EOS>
She
reach
the
house
without
any
impediment
,
look
at
the
number
,
knock
at
the
door
,
and
inquire
for
Miss
Tilney
.
<EOS>
the
man
believe
Miss
Tilney
to
be
at
home
,
but
be
not
quite
certain
.
<EOS>
Would
she
be
pleased
to
send
up
her
name
?
<EOS>
She
give
her
card
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
the
servant
return
,
and
with
a
look
which
do
not
quite
confirm
his
word
,
say
he
have
be
mistake
,
for
that
Miss
Tilney
be
walk
out
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
with
a
blush
of
mortification
,
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
feel
almost
persuade
that
Miss
Tilney
be
at
home
,
and
too
much
offend
to
admit
her
;
and
as
she
retire
down
the
street
,
could
not
withhold
one
glance
at
the
drawing
-
room
window
,
in
expectation
of
see
her
there
,
but
no
one
appear
at
them
.
<EOS>
at
the
bottom
of
the
street
,
however
,
she
look
back
again
,
and
then
,
not
at
a
window
,
but
issue
from
the
door
,
she
see
Miss
Tilney
herself
.
<EOS>
She
be
follow
by
a
gentleman
,
whom
Catherine
believe
to
be
her
father
,
and
they
turn
up
towards
Edgar
's
Buildings
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
in
deep
mortification
,
proceed
on
her
way
.
<EOS>
She
could
almost
be
angry
herself
at
such
angry
incivility
;
but
she
check
the
resentful
sensation
;
she
remember
her
own
ignorance
.
<EOS>
She
know
not
how
such
an
offence
as
her
may
be
class
by
the
law
of
worldly
politeness
,
to
what
a
degree
of
unforgivingness
it
may
with
propriety
lead
,
nor
to
what
rigours
of
rudeness
in
return
it
may
justly
make
her
amenable
.
  
<EOS>
deject
and
humble
<EOS>
,
she
have
even
some
thought
of
not
go
with
the
other
to
the
theatre
that
night
;
but
it
must
be
confess
that
they
be
not
of
long
continuance
,
for
she
soon
recollect
,
in
the
first
place
,
that
she
be
without
any
excuse
for
stay
at
home
;
and
,
in
the
second
,
that
it
be
a
play
she
want
very
much
to
see
.
<EOS>
to
the
theatre
accordingly
they
all
go
;
no
Tilneys
appear
to
plague
or
please
her
;
she
fear
that
,
amongst
the
many
perfection
of
the
family
,
a
fondness
for
play
be
not
to
be
rank
;
but
perhaps
it
be
because
they
be
habituate
to
the
fine
performance
of
the
London
stage
,
which
she
know
,
on
Isabella
's
authority
,
render
everything
else
of
the
kind
"
quite
horrid
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
not
deceive
in
her
own
expectation
of
pleasure
;
the
comedy
so
well
suspend
her
care
that
no
one
,
observe
her
during
the
first
four
act
,
would
have
suppose
she
have
any
wretchedness
about
her
.
<EOS>
on
the
beginning
of
the
fifth
,
however
,
the
sudden
view
of
Mr.
Henry
Tilney
and
his
father
,
join
a
party
in
the
opposite
box
,
recall
her
to
anxiety
and
distress
.
<EOS>
the
stage
could
no
longer
excite
genuine
merriment
 
no
longer
keep
her
whole
attention
.
<EOS>
every
other
look
upon
an
average
be
direct
towards
the
opposite
box
;
and
,
for
the
space
of
two
entire
scene
,
do
she
thus
watch
Henry
Tilney
,
without
be
once
able
to
catch
his
eye
.
<EOS>
no
longer
could
he
be
suspect
of
indifference
for
a
play
;
his
notice
be
never
withdraw
from
the
stage
during
two
whole
scene
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
he
do
look
towards
her
,
and
he
bow
 
but
such
a
bow
!
<EOS>
no
smile
,
no
continue
observance
attend
it
;
his
eye
be
immediately
return
to
their
former
direction
.
<EOS>
Catherine
be
restlessly
miserable
;
she
could
almost
have
run
round
to
the
box
in
which
he
sit
and
force
him
to
hear
her
explanation
.
<EOS>
feeling
rather
natural
than
heroic
possess
her
;
instead
of
consider
her
own
dignity
injure
by
this
ready
condemnation
 
instead
of
proudly
resolve
,
in
conscious
innocence
,
to
show
her
resentment
towards
him
who
could
harbour
a
doubt
of
it
,
to
leave
to
him
all
the
trouble
of
seek
an
explanation
,
and
to
enlighten
him
on
the
past
only
by
avoid
his
sight
,
or
flirt
with
somebody
else
 
she
take
to
herself
all
the
shame
of
misconduct
,
or
at
least
of
its
appearance
,
and
be
only
eager
for
an
opportunity
of
explain
its
cause
.
  
<EOS>
the
play
conclude
 
the
curtain
fall
 
<EOS>
Henry
Tilney
be
no
long
to
be
see
where
he
have
hitherto
sat
,
but
his
father
remain
,
and
perhaps
he
may
be
now
come
round
to
their
box
.
<EOS>
She
be
right
;
in
a
few
minute
he
appear
,
and
,
make
his
way
through
the
then
thin
row
,
speak
with
like
calm
politeness
to
Mrs.
Allen
and
her
friend
.
<EOS>
not
with
such
calmness
be
he
answer
by
the
latter
:
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Tilney
,
I
have
be
quite
wild
to
speak
to
you
,
and
make
my
apology
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
think
me
so
rude
;
but
indeed
it
be
not
my
own
fault
,
be
it
,
Mrs.
Allen

<EOS>
do
not
they
tell
me
that
Mr.
Tilney
and
his
sister
be
go
out
in
a
phaeton
together
?
<EOS>
and
then
what
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
but
I
have
ten
thousand
time
rather
have
be
with
you
;
now
have
not
I

Mrs.
Allen
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
you
tumble
my
gown

be
Mrs.
Allen
's
reply

<EOS>
Her
assurance
,
however
,
stand
sole
as
it
do
,
be
not
throw
away
;
it
bring
a
more
cordial
,
more
natural
smile
into
his
countenance
,
and
he
reply
in
a
tone
which
retain
only
a
little
affected
reserve
:
"
We
be
much
oblige
to
you
at
any
rate
for
wish
us
a
pleasant
walk
after
our
pass
you
in
Argyle
Street

you
be
so
kind
as
to
look
back
on
purpose

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
indeed
I
do
not
wish
you
a
pleasant
walk
;
I
never
think
of
such
a
thing
;
but
I
beg
Mr.
Thorpe
so
earnestly
to
stop
;
I
call
out
to
him
as
soon
as
ever
I
see
you
;
now
,
Mrs.
Allen

do
not
 
oh
!
<EOS>
You
be
not
there
;
but
indeed
I
do
;
and
,
if
Mr.
Thorpe
would
only
have
stop
,
I
would
have
jump
out
and
run
after
you

be
there
a

could

such

not

with
a
yet
sweet

say
everything

regret

oh
!
do
not

Miss
Tilney

not
angry

cry
Catherine

because
I
know
she

this
morning

I
see
her
walk
out
of
the
house
the
next
minute
after

I
be
hurt

but
I
be

perhaps
you
do
not

be
there

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
within
at
the

but
I
hear
of
it
from
Eleanor

and
she
have
be
wish
ever
since
to
see
you

to
explain
the
reason

such
incivility

perhaps
I
can
do

It

<EOS>
She
be
very
much
vexed
,
and
mean
to
make
her
apology
as
soon
as
possible
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
's
mind
be
greatly
ease
by
this
information
,
yet
a
something
of
solicitude
remain
,
from
which
spring
the
following
question
,
thoroughly
artless
in
itself
,
though
rather
distress
to
the
gentleman
:
"
<EOS>
but
,
Mr.
Tilney
,
why
be
you
less
generous
than
your
sister
?
<EOS>
if
she
feel
such
confidence
in
my
good
intention
,
and
could
suppose
it
to
be
only
a
mistake
,
why
should
you
be
so
ready
to
take
offence
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Me
!
<EOS>
I
take
offence
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
I
be
sure
by
your
look
,
when
you
come
into
the
box
,
you
be
angry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
angry
!
<EOS>
I
could
have
no
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
nobody
would
have
think
you
have
no
right
who
see
your
face
.
"
<EOS>
He
reply
by
ask
her
to
make
room
for
him
,
and
talk
of
the
play
.
  
<EOS>
He
remain
with
them
some
time
,
and
be
only
too
agreeable
for
Catherine
to
be
content
when
he
go
away
.
<EOS>
before
they
part
,
however
,
it
be
agree
that
the
project
walk
should
be
take
as
soon
as
possible
;
and
,
set
aside
the
misery
of
his
quit
their
box
,
she
be
,
upon
the
whole
,
leave
one
of
the
happy
creature
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
while
talk
to
each
other
,
she
have
observe
with
some
surprise
that
John
Thorpe
,
who
be
never
in
the
same
part
of
the
house
for
ten
minute
together
,
be
engage
in
conversation
with
General
Tilney
;
and
she
feel
something
more
than
surprise
when
she
think
she
could
perceive
herself
the
object
of
their
attention
and
discourse
.
<EOS>
what
could
they
have
to
say
of
her
?
<EOS>
She
fear
General
Tilney
do
not
like
her
appearance
:
she
find
it
be
imply
in
his
prevent
her
admittance
to
his
daughter
,
rather
than
postpone
his
own
walk
a
few
minute
.
<EOS>
"
how
come
Mr.
Thorpe
to
know
your
father
?
"
be
her
anxious
inquiry
,
as
she
point
them
out
to
her
companion
.
<EOS>
He
know
nothing
about
it
;
but
his
father
,
like
every
military
man
,
have
a
very
large
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
entertainment
be
over
,
Thorpe
come
to
assist
them
in
get
out
.
<EOS>
Catherine
be
the
immediate
object
of
his
gallantry
;
and
,
while
they
wait
in
the
lobby
for
a
chair
,
he
prevent
the
inquiry
which
have
travel
from
her
heart
almost
to
the
tip
of
her
tongue
,
by
ask
,
in
a
consequential
manner
,
whether
she
have
see
him
talk
with
General
Tilney
:
"
He
be
a
fine
old
fellow
,
upon
my
soul
!
<EOS>
stout
,
active
 
look
as
young
as
his
son
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
regard
for
him
,
I
assure
you
:
a
gentleman
-
like
,
good
sort
of
fellow
as
ever
live
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
how
come
you
to
know
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
know
him
!
<EOS>
there
be
few
people
much
about
town
that
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
I
have
meet
him
forever
at
the
Bedford
;
and
I
know
his
face
again
today
the
moment
he
come
into
the
billiard
-
room
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
good
player
we
have
,
by
the
by
;
and
we
have
a
little
touch
together
,
though
I
be
almost
afraid
of
him
at
first
:
<EOS>
the
odd
be
five
to
four
against
me
;
and
,
if
I
have
not
make
one
of
the
clean
stroke
that
perhaps
ever
be
make
in
this
world
 
<EOS>
I
take
his
ball
exactly
 
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
make
you
understand
it
without
a
table
;
however
,
I
do
beat
him
.
<EOS>
a
very
fine
fellow
;
as
rich
as
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
dine
with
him
;
I
dare
say
he
give
famous
dinner
.
<EOS>
but
what
do
you
think
we
have
be
talk
of
?
<EOS>
You
.
<EOS>
yes
,
by
heaven
!
<EOS>
and
the
general
think
you
the
fine
girl
in
Bath
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
nonsense
!
<EOS>
how
can
you
say
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
do
you
think
I
say
?
<EOS>
"
 
lower
his
voice
 
"
well
do
,
general
,
say
I
;
I
be
quite
of
your
mind
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
Catherine
,
who
be
much
less
gratified
by
his
admiration
than
by
General
Tilney
's
,
be
not
sorry
to
be
call
away
by
Mr.
Allen
.
<EOS>
Thorpe
,
however
,
would
see
her
to
her
chair
,
and
,
till
she
enter
it
,
continue
the
same
kind
of
delicate
flattery
,
in
spite
of
her
entreat
him
to
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
that
General
Tilney
,
instead
of
disliking
,
should
admire
her
,
be
very
delightful
;
and
she
joyfully
think
that
there
be
not
one
of
the
family
whom
she
need
now
fear
to
meet
.
<EOS>
the
evening
have
do
more
,
much
more
,
for
her
than
could
have
be
expect
.
    
<EOS>
Monday
,
Tuesday
,
Wednesday
,
Thursday
,
Friday
,
and
Saturday
have
now
pass
in
review
before
the
reader
;
the
event
of
each
day
,
its
hope
and
fear
,
mortification
and
pleasure
,
have
be
separately
state
,
and
the
pang
of
Sunday
only
now
remain
to
be
describe
,
and
close
the
week
.
<EOS>
the
Clifton
scheme
have
be
defer
,
not
relinquish
,
and
on
the
afternoon
's
Crescent
of
this
day
,
it
be
bring
forward
again
.
<EOS>
in
a
private
consultation
between
Isabella
and
James
,
the
former
of
whom
have
particularly
set
her
heart
upon
go
,
and
the
latter
no
less
anxiously
place
his
upon
please
her
,
it
be
agree
that
,
provide
the
weather
be
fair
,
the
party
should
take
place
on
the
following
morning
;
and
they
be
to
set
off
very
early
,
in
order
to
be
at
home
in
good
time
.
<EOS>
the
affair
thus
determine
,
and
Thorpe
's
approbation
secure
,
Catherine
only
remain
to
be
apprise
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
leave
them
for
a
few
minute
to
speak
to
Miss
Tilney
.
<EOS>
in
that
interval
the
plan
be
complete
,
and
as
soon
as
she
come
again
,
her
agreement
be
demand
;
but
instead
of
the
gay
acquiescence
expect
by
Isabella
,
Catherine
look
grave
,
be
very
sorry
,
but
could
not
go
.
<EOS>
the
engagement
which
ought
to
have
keep
her
from
join
in
the
former
attempt
would
make
it
impossible
for
her
to
accompany
them
now
.
<EOS>
She
have
that
moment
settle
with
Miss
Tilney
to
take
their
propose
walk
tomorrow
;
it
be
quite
determined
,
and
she
would
not
,
upon
any
account
,
retract
.
<EOS>
but
that
she
must
and
should
retract
be
instantly
the
eager
cry
of
both
the
thorpe
;
they
must
go
to
Clifton
tomorrow
,
they
would
not
go
without
her
,
it
would
be
nothing
to
put
off
a
mere
walk
for
one
day
longer
,
and
they
would
not
hear
of
a
refusal
.
<EOS>
Catherine
be
distressed
,
but
not
subdue
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
urge
me
,
Isabella
.
<EOS>
I
be
engage
to
Miss
Tilney
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
go
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
avail
nothing
.
<EOS>
the
same
argument
assail
her
again
;
she
must
go
,
she
should
go
,
and
they
would
not
hear
of
a
refusal
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
so
easy
to
tell
Miss
Tilney
that
you
have
just
be
remind
of
a
prior
engagement
,
and
must
only
beg
to
put
off
the
walk
till
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
,
it
would
not
be
easy
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
no
prior
engagement
.
"
<EOS>
but
Isabella
become
only
more
and
more
urgent
,
call
on
her
in
the
most
affectionate
manner
,
address
her
by
the
most
endearing
name
.
<EOS>
She
be
sure
her
dear
,
sweetest
Catherine
would
not
seriously
refuse
such
a
trifling
request
to
a
friend
who
love
her
so
dearly
.
<EOS>
She
know
her
beloved
Catherine
to
have
so
feel
a
heart
,
so
sweet
a
temper
,
to
be
so
easily
persuade
by
those
she
love
.
<EOS>
but
all
in
vain
;
Catherine
feel
herself
to
be
in
the
right
,
and
though
pain
by
such
tender
,
such
flattering
supplication
,
could
not
allow
it
to
influence
her
.
<EOS>
Isabella
then
try
another
method
.
<EOS>
She
reproach
her
with
have
more
affection
for
Miss
Tilney
,
though
she
have
know
her
so
little
a
while
,
than
for
her
good
and
old
friend
,
with
be
grow
cold
and
indifferent
,
in
short
,
towards
herself
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
help
be
jealous
,
Catherine
,
when
I
see
myself
slight
for
stranger
,
I
,
who
love
you
so
excessively
!
<EOS>
when
once
my
affection
be
place
,
it
be
not
in
the
power
of
anything
to
change
them
.
<EOS>
but
I
believe
my
feeling
be
strong
than
anybody
be
;
I
be
sure
they
be
too
strong
for
my
own
peace
;
and
to
see
myself
supplant
in
your
friendship
by
stranger
do
cut
me
to
the
quick
,
I
own
.
<EOS>
these
Tilneys
seem
to
swallow
up
everything
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
think
this
reproach
equally
strange
and
unkind
.
<EOS>
be
it
the
part
of
a
friend
thus
to
expose
her
feeling
to
the
notice
of
other
?
<EOS>
Isabella
appear
to
her
ungenerous
and
selfish
,
regardless
of
everything
but
her
own
gratification
.
<EOS>
these
painful
idea
cross
her
mind
,
though
she
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
Isabella
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
have
apply
her
handkerchief
to
her
eye
;
and
Morland
,
miserable
at
such
a
sight
,
could
not
help
say
,
"
Nay
,
Catherine
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
can
not
stand
out
any
long
now
.
<EOS>
the
sacrifice
be
not
much
;
and
to
oblige
such
a
friend
 
<EOS>
I
shall
think
you
quite
unkind
,
if
you
still
refuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
first
time
of
her
brother
's
openly
side
against
her
,
and
anxious
to
avoid
his
displeasure
,
she
propose
a
compromise
.
<EOS>
if
they
would
only
put
off
their
scheme
till
Tuesday
,
which
they
may
easily
do
,
as
it
depend
only
on
themselves
,
she
could
go
with
them
,
and
everybody
may
then
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
but
"
no
,
no
,
no
!
<EOS>
"
be
the
immediate
answer
;
"
that
could
not
be
,
for
Thorpe
do
not
know
that
he
may
not
go
to
town
on
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
"
Catherine
be
sorry
,
but
could
do
no
more
;
and
a
short
silence
ensue
,
which
be
break
by
Isabella
,
who
in
a
voice
of
cold
resentment
say
,
"
very
well
,
then
there
be
an
end
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
if
Catherine
do
not
go
,
I
can
not
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
be
the
only
woman
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
,
upon
any
account
in
the
world
,
do
so
improper
a
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Catherine
,
you
must
go
,
"
say
James
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
why
can
not
Mr.
Thorpe
drive
one
of
his
other
sister
?
<EOS>
I
dare
say
either
of
them
would
like
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
thank
ye
,
"
cry
Thorpe
,
"
but
I
do
not
come
to
Bath
to
drive
my
sister
about
,
and
look
like
a
fool
.
<EOS>
no
,
if
you
do
not
go
,
d---
me
if
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
only
go
for
the
sake
of
drive
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
compliment
which
give
me
no
pleasure
.
"
<EOS>
but
her
word
be
lose
on
Thorpe
,
who
have
turn
abruptly
away
.
  
<EOS>
the
three
other
still
continue
together
,
walk
in
a
most
uncomfortable
manner
to
poor
Catherine
;
sometimes
not
a
word
be
say
,
sometimes
she
be
again
attack
with
supplication
or
reproach
,
and
her
arm
be
still
link
within
Isabella
's
,
though
their
heart
be
at
war
.
<EOS>
at
one
moment
she
be
soften
,
at
another
irritated
;
always
distressed
,
but
always
steady
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
you
have
be
so
obstinate
,
Catherine
,
"
say
James
;
"
you
be
not
use
to
be
so
hard
to
persuade
;
you
once
be
the
kind
,
best
-
temper
of
my
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
be
not
less
so
now
,
"
she
reply
,
very
feelingly
;
"
<EOS>
but
indeed
I
can
not
go
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
wrong
,
I
be
do
what
I
believe
to
be
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suspect
,
"
say
Isabella
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
there
be
no
great
struggle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
's
heart
swell
;
she
draw
away
her
arm
,
and
Isabella
make
no
opposition
.
<EOS>
thus
pass
a
long
ten
minute
,
till
they
be
again
join
by
Thorpe
,
who
,
come
to
them
with
a
gayer
look
,
say
,
"
well
,
I
have
settle
the
matter
,
and
now
we
may
all
go
tomorrow
with
a
safe
conscience
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
to
Miss
Tilney
,
and
make
your
excuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Catherine
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
upon
my
soul
.
<EOS>
leave
her
this
moment
.
<EOS>
tell
her
you
have
send
me
to
say
that
,
have
just
recollect
a
prior
engagement
of
go
to
Clifton
with
us
tomorrow
,
you
could
not
have
the
pleasure
of
walk
with
her
till
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
She
say
very
well
,
Tuesday
be
just
as
convenient
to
her
;
so
there
be
an
end
of
all
our
difficulty
.
<EOS>
a
pretty
good
thought
of
mine
 
hey
?
"
  
<EOS>
Isabella
's
countenance
be
once
more
all
smile
and
good
humour
,
and
James
too
look
happy
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
most
heavenly
think
indeed
!
<EOS>
now
,
my
sweet
Catherine
,
all
our
distress
be
over
;
you
be
honourably
acquit
,
and
we
shall
have
a
most
delightful
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
will
not
do
,
"
say
Catherine
;
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
submit
to
this
.
<EOS>
I
must
run
after
Miss
Tilney
directly
and
set
her
right
.
"
  
<EOS>
Isabella
,
however
,
catch
hold
of
one
hand
,
Thorpe
of
the

remonstrance

from
all
three

<EOS>
even
James
be
quite
angry
.
<EOS>
when
everything
be
settle
,
when
Miss
Tilney
herself
say
that
Tuesday
would
suit
her
as
well
,
it
be
quite
ridiculous
,
quite
absurd
,
to
make
any
further
objection
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorpe
have
no
business
to
invent
any
such
message
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
think
it
right
to
put
it
off
,
I
could
have
speak
to
Miss
Tilney
myself
.
<EOS>
this
be
only
do
it
in
a
ruder
way
;
and
how
do
I
know
that
Mr.
Thorpe
have
 
<EOS>
He
may
be
mistake
again
perhaps
;
he
lead
me
into
one
act
of
rudeness
by
his
mistake
on
Friday
.
<EOS>
let
me
go
,
Mr.
Thorpe
;
Isabella
,
do
not
hold
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Thorpe
tell
her
it
would
be
in
vain
to
go
after
the
Tilneys
;
they
be
turn
the
corner
into
Brock
Street
,
when
he
have
overtake
them
,
and
be
at
home
by
this
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
go
after
them
,
"
say
Catherine
;
"
wherever
they
be
I
will
go
after
them
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
signify
talk
.
<EOS>
if
I
could
not
be
persuade
into
do
what
I
think
wrong
,
I
never
will
be
trick
into
it
.
"
<EOS>
and
with
these
word
she
break
away
and
hurry
off
.
<EOS>
Thorpe
would
have
dart
after
her
,
but
Morland
withhold
him
.
<EOS>
"
let
her
go
,
let
her
go
,
if
she
will
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
as
obstinate
as
 
"
  
<EOS>
Thorpe
never
finish
the
simile
,
for
it
could
hardly
have
be
a
proper
one
.
  
<EOS>
away
walk
Catherine
in
great
agitation
,
as
fast
as
the
crowd
would
permit
her
,
fearful
of
be
pursue
,
yet
determine
to
persevere
.
<EOS>
as
she
walk
,
she
reflect
on
what
have
pass
.
<EOS>
It
be
painful
to
her
to
disappoint
and
displease
them
,
particularly
to
displease
her
brother
;
but
she
could
not
repent
her
resistance
.
<EOS>
set
her
own
inclination
apart
,
to
have
fail
a
second
time
in
her
engagement
to
Miss
Tilney
,
to
have
retract
a
promise
voluntarily
make
only
five
minute
before
,
and
on
a
false
pretence
too
,
must
have
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
be
withstand
them
on
selfish
principle
alone
,
she
have
not
consult
merely
her
own
gratification
;
that
may
have
be
ensure
in
some
degree
by
the
excursion
itself
,
by
see
Blaize
Castle
;
no
,
she
have
attend
to
what
be
due
to
other
,
and
to
her
own
character
in
their
opinion
.
<EOS>
Her
conviction
of
be
right
,
however
,
be
not
enough
to
restore
her
composure
;
till
she
have
speak
to
Miss
Tilney
she
could
not
be
at
ease
;
and
quicken
her
pace
when
she
get
clear
of
the
Crescent
,
she
almost
run
over
the
remain
ground
till
she
gain
the
top
of
Milsom
Street
.
<EOS>
so
rapid
have
be
her
movement
that
in
spite
of
the
Tilneys
'
advantage
in
the
outset
,
they
be
but
just
turn
into
their
lodging
as
she
come
within
view
of
them
;
and
the
servant
still
remain
at
the
open
door
,
she
use
only
the
ceremony
of
say
that
she
must
speak
with
Miss
Tilney
that
moment
,
and
hurry
by
him
proceed
upstairs
.
<EOS>
then
,
open
the
first
door
before
her
,
which
happen
to
be
the
right
,
she
immediately
find
herself
in
the
drawing
-
room
with
General
Tilney
,
his
son
,
and
daughter
.
<EOS>
Her
explanation
,
defective
only
in
be
 
from
her
irritation
of
nerve
and
shortness
of
breath
 
<EOS>
no
explanation
at
all
,
be
instantly
give
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
come
in
a
great
hurry
 
<EOS>
It
be
all
a
mistake
 
<EOS>
I
never
promise
to
go
 
<EOS>
I
tell
them
from
the
first
I
could
not
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
run
away
in
a
great
hurry
to
explain
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
what
you
think
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
stay
for
the
servant
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
business
,
however
,
though
not
perfectly
elucidate
by
this
speech
,
soon
cease
to
be
a
puzzle
.
<EOS>
Catherine
find
that
John
Thorpe
have
give
the
message
;
and
Miss
Tilney
have
no
scruple
in
own
herself
greatly
surprised
by
it
.
<EOS>
but
whether
her
brother
have
still
exceed
her
in
resentment
,
Catherine
,
though
she
instinctively
address
herself
as
much
to
one
as
to
the
other
in
her
vindication
,
have
no
means
of
know
.
<EOS>
whatever
may
have
be
feel
before
her
arrival
,
her
eager
declaration
immediately
make
every
look
and
sentence
as
friendly
as
she
could
desire
.
  
<EOS>
the
affair
thus
happily
settle
,
she
be
introduce
by
Miss
Tilney
to
her
father
,
and
receive
by
him
with
such
ready
,
such
solicitous
politeness
as
recall
Thorpe
's
information
to
her
mind
,
and
make
her
think
with
pleasure
that
he
may
be
sometimes
depend
on
.
<EOS>
to
such
anxious
attention
be
the
general
's
civility
carry
,
that
not
aware
of
her
extraordinary
swiftness
in
enter
the
house
,
he
be
quite
angry
with
the
servant
whose
neglect
have
reduce
her
to
open
the
door
of
the
apartment
herself
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
William
mean
by
it
?
<EOS>
He
should
make
a
point
of
inquire
into
the
matter
.
"
<EOS>
and
if
Catherine
have
not
most
warmly
assert
his
innocence
,
it
seem
likely
that
William
would
lose
the
favour
of
his
master
forever
,
if
not
his
place
,
by
her
rapidity
.
  
<EOS>
after
sit
with
them
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
she
rise
to
take
leave
,
and
be
then
most
agreeably
surprised
by
General
Tilney
's
ask
her
if
she
would
do
his
daughter
the
honour
of
dining
and
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
with
her
.
<EOS>
Miss
Tilney
add
her
own
wish
.
<EOS>
Catherine
be
greatly
oblige
;
but
it
be
quite
out
of
her
power
.
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Allen
would
expect
her
back
every
moment
.
<EOS>
the
general
declare
he
could
say
no
more
;
the
claim
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Allen
be
not
to
be
superseded
;
but
on
some
other
day
he
trust
,
when
long
notice
could
be
give
,
they
would
not
refuse
to
spare
her
to
her
friend
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
no
<EOS>
;
Catherine
be
sure
they
would
not
have
the
least
objection
,
and
she
should
have
great
pleasure
in
come
.
<EOS>
"
the
general
attend
her
himself
to
the
street
-
door
,
say
everything
gallant
as
they
go
downstairs
,
admire
the
elasticity
of
her
walk
,
which
correspond
exactly
with
the
spirit
of
her
dancing
,
and
make
her
one
of
the
most
graceful
bow
she
have
ever
beheld
,
when
they
part
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
,
delight
by
all
that
have
pass
,
proceed
gaily
to
Pulteney
Street
,
walk
,
as
she
conclude
,
with
great
elasticity
,
though
she
have
never
think
of
it
before
.
<EOS>
She
reach
home
without
see
anything
more
of
the
offend
party
;
and
now
that
she
have
be
triumphant
throughout
,
have
carry
her
point
,
and
be
secure
of
her
walk
<EOS>
,
she
begin
(
as
the
flutter
of
her
spirit
subside
)
to
doubt
whether
she
have
be
perfectly
right
.
<EOS>
a
sacrifice
be
always
noble
;
and
if
she
have
give
way
to
their
entreaty
,
she
should
have
be
spare
the
distress
idea
of
a
friend
displeased
,
a
brother
angry
,
and
a
scheme
of
great
happiness
to
both
destroy
,
perhaps
through
her
mean
.
<EOS>
to
ease
her
mind
,
and
ascertain
by
the
opinion
of
an
unprejudiced
person
what
her
own
conduct
have
really
be
,
she
take
occasion
to
mention
before
Mr.
Allen
the
half
-
settle
scheme
of
her
brother
and
the
Thorpes
for
the
follow
day
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Allen
catch
at
it
directly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
do
you
think
of
go
too
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
have
just
engage
myself
to
walk
with
Miss
Tilney
before
they
tell
me
of
it
;
and
therefore
you
know
I
could
not
go
with
them
,
could
I
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
certainly
not
;
and
I
be
glad
you
do
not

of
it

<EOS>
these
scheme
be
not
at
all
the
thing
.
<EOS>
young
man
and
woman
drive
about
the
country
in
open
carriage
!
<EOS>
now
and
then
it
be
very
well
;
but
go
to
inn
and
public
place
together
!
<EOS>
It
be
not
right
;
and
I
wonder
Mrs.
Thorpe
should
allow
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
glad
you
do
not
think
of
go
;
I
be
sure
Mrs.
Morland
would
not
be
pleased
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Allen
,
be
not
you
of
my
way
of
thinking
?
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
these
kind
of
project
objectionable
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
very
much
so
indeed

<EOS>
open
carriage

nasty

in

out

your
hair

your
bonnet

I
hate
an
open
carriage
myself

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
do
;
but
that
be
not
the
question

<EOS>
do
not
you
think
it
have
an
odd
appearance
,
if
young
lady

frequently

about

young
man

to
whom
they
be

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
my
dear
,
a
very
odd
appearance
indeed

I
can
not
bear
to
see
it
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
dear
madam
,

cry
Catherine
,

then
why
do
not
you
tell
me
so
before
?
<EOS>
I
be
sure
if
I
have
know
it
to
be
improper
,
I
would
not
have
go
with
Mr.
Thorpe
at
all
;

I
always
hope
you
would
tell
me
,
if
you
think
I
be
do
wrong

"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
I
should
,
my
dear

you
may
depend
on
it
;
for
as
I
tell
Mrs.
Morland
at
parting
,
I
would
always
do
the
good
for
you
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
but
one
must
not
be
over
particular
.
<EOS>
young
people
will
be
young
people
,
as
your
good
mother
say
herself
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
want
you
,
when
we
first
come

not

buy
that
sprig

you
would

young
people
do
not

to
be

<EOS>

but
this
be
something
of
real
consequence

hard

I

advise

not

go
out
with
Mr.

any
more

just
what
I

<EOS>
Catherine

relieve
for
herself

feel
uneasy
for
Isabella

and
after
a
moment
's
thought
,
ask
Mr.
Allen
whether
it
would
not
be
both
proper
and
kind
in
her
to
write
to
Miss
Thorpe
,
and
explain
the
indecorum
of
which
she
must
be
as
insensible
as
herself

for
she
consider
that
Isabella
may
otherwise
perhaps
be
go
to
Clifton
the
next
day

in
spite
of
what
have
pass

<EOS>
Mr.
Allen
,
however
,
discourage
her
from
do
any
such
thing

<EOS>
"
You
have
better
leave
her
alone
,
my
dear

she
be
old
enough
to
know
what
she
be
about
,
and
if
not
,
have
a
mother
to
advise
her
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Thorpe
be
too
indulgent
beyond
a
doubt
;
but
,
however
,
you
have
well
not
interfere
.
<EOS>
She
and
your
brother
choose
to
go
,
and
you
will
be
only
get
ill
will

"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
submit
,
and
though
sorry
to
think
that
Isabella
should
be
do
wrong
,
feel
greatly
relieve
by
Mr.
Allen
's
approbation
of
her
own
conduct
,
and
truly
rejoice
to
be
preserve
by
his
advice
from
the
danger
of
fall
into
such
an
error
herself
.
<EOS>
Her
escape
from
be
one
of
the
party
to
Clifton
be
now
an
escape
indeed
;
for
what
would
the
Tilneys
have
think
of
her
,
if
she
have
break
her
promise
to
them
in
order
to
do
what
be
wrong
in
itself
,
if
she
have
be
guilty
of
one
breach
of
propriety
,
only
to
enable
her
to
be
guilty
of
another
?
    
<EOS>
the
next
morning
be
fair

Catherine
almost
expect
another
attack
from
the
assemble
party

<EOS>
with
Mr.
Allen
to
support
her
,
she
feel
no
dread
of
the
event
:
but
she
would
gladly
be
spare
a
contest
,
where
victory
itself
be
painful
,
and
be
heartily
rejoice
therefore
at
neither
see
nor
hear
anything
of
them

<EOS>
the
Tilneys
call
for
her
at
the
appoint
time

no
new
difficulty
arise
,
no
sudden
recollection
,
no
unexpected
summon
,
no
impertinent
intrusion
to
disconcert
their
measure
,
my
heroine
be
most
unnaturally
able
to
fulfil
her
engagement

it

I
remember
that
you
undertake

that
when

be
call
away
for
only
five
minute
to
answer
a
note

instead
of
wait
for
me

you
take
the
volume
into
the

Walk

I

oblige

stay
till
you
have
finish
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

thank
you
,
Eleanor
 
a
most
honourable
testimony
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
Miss
Morland
,
the
injustice
of
your
suspicion
.
<EOS>
here
be
I
,
in
my
eagerness
to
get
on
,
refuse
to
wait
only
five
minute
for
my
sister

break
the
promise
I
have
make
of
read
it
aloud
,
and
keep
her
in
suspense
at
a
most
interesting
part
,
by
run
away
with
the
volume
,
which
,
you
be
to
observe
,
be
her
own
,
particularly
her
own
.
<EOS>
I
be
proud
when
I
reflect
on
it
,
and
I
think
it
must
establish
me
in
your
good
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
to
hear
it
indeed
,
and
now
I
shall
never
be
ashamed
of
like
Udolpho
myself

<EOS>
but
I
really
think
before
,
young
man
despise
novel
amazingly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
amazingly
;
it
may
well
suggest
amazement
if
they
do
 
for
they
read
nearly
as
many
as
woman
.
<EOS>
I
myself
have
read
hundred
and
hundred
.
<EOS>
do
not
imagine
that
you
can
cope
with
me
in
a
knowledge
of
Julias
and
Louisas
.
<EOS>
if
we
proceed
to
particular
,
and
engage
in
the
never

cease
inquiry
of
"
have
you
read
this

"
have
you
read
that

I
shall
soon
leave
you
as
far
behind
me

what
shall
I
say

<EOS>
I
want
an
appropriate
simile

<EOS>
as
far
as
your
friend
emily
herself
leave
poor
Valancourt
when
she
go
with
her
aunt
into
Italy

<EOS>
consider
how
many

the
start
of
you

I
have
enter
on
my
study
at
Oxford

good
little

work
your
sampler
at

"
  
<EOS>
"
not
very
good
,
I
be
afraid
.
<EOS>
but
now
really
,
do
not
you
think
Udolpho
the
nice
book
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
nice
 
<EOS>
by
which
I

Henry

very
impertinent

He

the

liberty

<EOS>
the
word
"
nice
,
"
as
you
use
it
,
do
not
suit
him
;
and
you
have
well
change
it
as
soon

"
I
be
sure

"
cry
Catherine

I
do
not
mean
to

anything
wrong

it

a
nice

why
should
not
I
call
it
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
true

Henry

this
be
a
very
nice
day

we
be
take
a
very
nice
walk

you
be
two
very
nice
young

<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
nice

indeed

<EOS>
It
do
for
everything

<EOS>
originally
perhaps
it

apply
only
to
express
neatness

propriety
,
delicacy

or
refinement
 
people
be
nice
in
their
dress

in

now
every

one
word

<EOS>

while
,
in
fact
,
"

his

it
ought
only
to
be
apply
to
you

without
any
commendation
at
all

<EOS>
You
be
more
nice
than
wise
.
<EOS>
come
,
Miss
Morland
,
let
us
leave
him
to
meditate
over
our
fault
in
the
utmost
propriety
of
diction
,
while
we
praise
Udolpho
in
whatever
term
we
like
best
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
most
interesting
work
.
<EOS>
You
be
fond
of
that
kind
of
reading
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
to
say
the
truth
,
I
do
not
much
like
any
other
.
"
  
"
indeed
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
is
,
I
can
read
poetry
and
play
,
and
thing
of
that
sort
,
and
do
not
dislike
travel
.
<EOS>
but
history
,
real
solemn
history
,
I
can
not
be
interested
in
.
<EOS>
Can
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
be
fond
of
history
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
be
too
.
<EOS>
I
read
it
a
little
as
a
duty
,
but
it
tell
me
nothing
that
do
not
either
vex
or
weary
me
.
<EOS>
the
quarrel
of
pope
and
king
,
with
war
or
pestilence
,
in
every
page
;
the
man
all
so
good
for
nothing
,
and
hardly
any
woman
at
all
 
<EOS>
it
be
very
tiresome
:
<EOS>
and
yet
I
often
think
it
odd
that
it
should
be
so
dull
,
for
a
great
deal
of
it
must
be
invention
.
<EOS>
the
speech
that
be
put
into
the
hero
'
mouth
,
their
thought
and
design
 
the
chief
of
all
this
must
be
invention
,
and
invention
be
what
delight
me
in
other
book
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Historians
,
you
think
,
"
say
Miss
Tilney
,
"
be
not
happy
in
their
flight
of
fancy
.
<EOS>
They
display
imagination
without
raise
interest
.
<EOS>
I
be
fond
of
history
 
and
be
very
well
contented
to
take
the
false
with
the
true
.
<EOS>
in
the
principal
fact
they
have
source
of
intelligence
in
former
history
and
record
,
which
may
be
as
much
depend
on
,
I
conclude
,
as
anything
that
do
not
actually
pass
under
one
's
own
observation
;
and
as
for
the
little
embellishment
you
speak
of
,
they
be
embellishment
,
and
I
like
them
as
such
.
<EOS>
if
a
speech
be
well
draw
up
,
I
read
it
with
pleasure
,
by
whomsoever
it
may
be
make
 
and
probably
with
much
great
,
if
the
production
of
Mr.
Hume
or
Mr.
Robertson
,
than
if
the
genuine
word
of
Caractacus
,
Agricola
,
or
Alfred
the
great
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
fond
of
history
!
<EOS>
and
so
be
Mr.
Allen
and
my
father
;
and
I
have
two
brother
who
do
not
dislike
it
.
<EOS>
so
many
instance
within
my
small
circle
of
friend
be
remarkable
!
<EOS>
at
this
rate
,
I
shall
not
pity
the
writer
of
history
any
longer
.
<EOS>
if
people
like
to
read
their
book
,
it
be
all
very
well
,
but
to
be
at
so
much
trouble
in
fill
great
volume
,
which
,
as
I
use
to
think
,
nobody
would
willingly
ever
look
into
,
to
be
labour
only
for
the
torment
of
little
boy
and
girl
,
always
strike
me
as
a
hard
fate
;
and
though
I
know
it
be
all
very
right
and
necessary
,
I
have
often
wonder
at
the
person
's
courage
that
could
sit
down
on
purpose
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
that
little
boy
and
girl
should
be
torment
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
be
what
no
one
at
all
acquaint
with
human
nature
in
a
civilized
state
can
deny
;
but
in
behalf
of
our
most
distinguished
historian
,
I
must
observe
that
they
may
well
be
offend
at
be
suppose
to
have
no
high
aim
,
and
that
by
their
method
and
style
,
they
be
perfectly
well
qualified
to
torment
reader
of
the
most
advanced
reason
and
mature
time
of
life
.
<EOS>
I
use
the
verb
"
to
torment
,
"
as
I
observe
to
be
your
own
method
,
instead
of
"
to
instruct
,
"
suppose
them
to
be
now
admit
as
synonymous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
me
foolish
to
call
instruction
a
torment
,
but
if
you
have
be
as
much
use
as
myself
to
hear
poor
little
child
first
learn
their
letter
and
then
learn
to
spell
,
if
you
have
ever
see
how
stupid
they
can
be
for
a
whole
morning
together
,
and
how
tired
my
poor
mother
be
at
the
end
of
it
,
as
I
be
in
the
habit
of
see
almost
every
day
of
my
life
at
home
,
you
would
allow
that
"
to
torment
'
and
"
to
instruct
'
may
sometimes
be
use
as
synonymous
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
very
probably
.
<EOS>
but
historian
be
not
accountable
for
the
difficulty
of
learn
to
read
;
and
even
you
yourself
,
who
do
not
altogether
seem
particularly
friendly
to
very
severe
,
very
intense
application
,
may
perhaps
be
bring
to
acknowledge
that
it
be
very
well
worth
-
while
to
be
torment
for
two
or
three
year
of
one
's
life
,
for
the
sake
of
be
able
to
read
all
the
rest
of
it
.
<EOS>
consider
 
if
reading
have
not
be
teach
,
Mrs.
Radcliffe
would
have
write
in
vain
 
or
perhaps
may
not
have
write
at
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
assent
 
and
a
very
warm
panegyric
from
her
on
that
lady
's
merit
close
the
subject
.
<EOS>
the
Tilneys
be
soon
engage
in
another
on
which
she
have
nothing
to
say
.
<EOS>
They
be
view
the
country
with
the
eye
of
person
accustom
to
drawing
,
and
decide
on
its
capability
of
be
form
into
picture
,
with
all
the
eagerness
of
real
taste
.
<EOS>
here
Catherine
be
quite
lose
.
<EOS>
She
know
nothing
of
draw
 
nothing
of
taste
:
and
she
listen
to
them
with
an
attention
which
bring
her
little
profit
,
for
they
talk
in
phrase
which
convey
scarcely
any
idea
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
little
which
she
could
understand
,
however
,
appear
to
contradict
the
very
few
notion
she
have
entertain
on
the
matter
before
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
a
good
view
be
no
long
to
be
take
from
the
top
of
an
high
hill
,
and
that
a
clear
blue
sky
be
no
longer
a
proof
of
a
fine
day
.
<EOS>
She
be
heartily
ashamed
of
her
ignorance
.
<EOS>
a
misplaced
shame
.
<EOS>
where
people
wish
to
attach
,
they
should
always
be
ignorant
.
<EOS>
to
come
with
a
well
-
inform
mind
be
to
come
with
an
inability
of
administer
to
the
vanity
of
other
,
which
a
sensible
person
would
always
wish
to
avoid
.
<EOS>
a
woman
especially
,
if
she
have
the
misfortune
of
know
anything
,
should
conceal
it
as
well
as
she
can
.
  
<EOS>
the
advantage
of
natural
folly
in
a
beautiful
girl
have
be
already
set
forth
by
the
capital
pen
of
a
sister
author
;
and
to
her
treatment
of
the
subject
I
will
only
add
,
in
justice
to
man
,
that
though
to
the
large
and
more
trifling
part
of
the
sex
,
imbecility
in
female
be
a
great
enhancement
of
their
personal
charm
,
there
be
a
portion
of
them
too
reasonable
and
too
well
inform
themselves
to
desire
anything
more
in
woman
than
ignorance
.
<EOS>
but
Catherine
do
not
know
her
own
advantage
 
do
not
know
that
a
good
-
look
girl
,
with
an
affectionate
heart
and
a
very
ignorant
mind
,
can
not
fail
of
attract
a
clever
young
man
,
unless
circumstance
be
particularly
untoward
.
<EOS>
in
the
present
instance
,
she
confess
and
lament
her
want
of
knowledge
,
declare
that
she
would
give
anything
in
the
world
to
be
able
to
draw
;
and
a
lecture
on
the
picturesque
immediately
follow
,
in
which
his
instruction
be
so
clear
that
she
soon
begin
to
see
beauty
in
everything
admire
by
him
,
and
her
attention
be
so
earnest
that
he
become
perfectly
satisfied
of
her
have
a
great
deal
of
natural
taste
.
<EOS>
He
talk
of
foreground
,
distance
,
and
second
distance
 
side
-
screen
and
perspective
 
light
and
shade
;
and
Catherine
be
so
hopeful
<EOS>
a
scholar
that
when
they
gain
the
top
of
Beechen
Cliff
,
she
voluntarily
reject
the
whole
city
of
Bath
as
unworthy
to
make
part
of
a
landscape
.
<EOS>
delight
with
her
progress
,
and
fearful
of
weary
her
with
too
much
wisdom
at
once
,
Henry
suffer
the
subject
to
decline
,
and
by
an
easy
transition
from
a
piece
of
rocky
fragment
and
the
withered
oak
which
he
have
place
near
its
summit
,
to
oak
in
general
,
to
forest
,
the
enclosure
of
them
,
waste
land
,
crown
land
and
government
,
he
shortly
find
himself
arrive
at
politic
;
and
from
politic
,
it
be
an
easy
step
to
silence
.
<EOS>
the
general
pause
which
succeed
his
short
disquisition
on
the
state
of
the
nation
be
put
an
end
to
by
Catherine
,
who
,
in
rather
a
solemn
tone
of
voice
,
utter
these
word
,
"
I
have
hear
that
something
very
shocking
indeed
will
soon
come
out
in

hastily

<EOS>

a

an
account
of

My

the

<EOS>
Miss

<EOS>
and
you
,
Miss

<EOS>
my
stupid
sister
have
mistake
all
your
clear
expression

<EOS>
You
talk
of
expect
horror
in
London
 
and
instead
of
instantly
conceive
,
as
any
rational
creature
would
have
do
,
that
such
word
could
relate
only
to
a

she
immediately

the

you
mean

have
her

You
know

"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Morland
,
I
think
very
highly
of
the
understanding
of
all
the
woman
in
the
world
 
especially
of
those
 
whoever
they
may
be
 
with

be

company

<EOS>
"
that
be
not
enough
.
<EOS>
be
more
serious

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Morland
,
no
one
can
think
more
highly
of
the
understanding
of
woman
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
in
my
opinion
,
nature
have
give
them
so
much
that
they
never
find
it
necessary
to
use
more
than
half
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
get
nothing
more
serious
from
him
now
,
Miss
Morland
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
in
a
sober
mood
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
assure
you
that
he
must
be
entirely
misunderstood
,
if
he
can
ever
appear
to
say
an
unjust
thing
of
any
woman
at
all
,
or
an
unkind
one
of
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
no
effort
to
Catherine
to
believe
that
Henry
Tilney
could
never
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
His
manner
may
sometimes
surprise
,
but
his
meaning
must
always
be
just
:
and
what
she
do
not
understand
,
she
be
almost
as
ready
to
admire
,
as
what
she
do
.
<EOS>
the
whole
walk
be
delightful
,
and
though
it
end
too
soon
,
its
conclusion
be
delightful
too
;
her
friend
attend
her
into
the
house
,
and
Miss
Tilney
,
before
they
part
,
address
herself
with
respectful
form
,
as
much
to
Mrs.
Allen
as
to
Catherine
,
petition
for
the
pleasure
of
her
company
to
dinner
on
the
day
after
the
next
.
<EOS>
no
difficulty
be
make
on
Mrs.
Allen
's
side
,
and
the
only
difficulty
on
Catherine
's
be
in
conceal
the
excess
of
her
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
the
morning
have
pass
away
so
charmingly
as
to
banish
all
her
friendship
and
natural
affection
,
for
no
thought
of
Isabella
or
James
have
cross
her
during
their
walk
.
<EOS>
when
the
Tilneys
be
go
,
she
become
amiable
again
,
but
she
be
amiable
for
some
time
to
little
effect
;
Mrs.
Allen
have
no
intelligence
to
give
that
could
relieve
her
anxiety
;
she
have
hear
nothing
of
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
towards
the
end
of
the
morning
,
however
,
Catherine
,
have
occasion
for
some
indispensable
yard
of
ribbon
which
must
be
buy
without
a
moment
's
delay
,
walk
out
into
the
town
,
and
in
Bond
Street
overtook
the
second
Miss
Thorpe
as
she
be
loiter
towards
Edgar
's
building
between
two
of
the
sweetest
girl
in
the
world
,
who
have
be
her
dear
friend
all
the
morning
.
<EOS>
from
her
,
she
soon
learn
that
the
party
to
Clifton
have
take
place
.
<EOS>
"
They
set
off
at
eight
this
morning
,
"
say
Miss
Anne
,
"
and
I
be
sure
I
do
not
envy
them
their
drive
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
and
I
be
very
well
off
to
be
out
of
the
scrape
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
the
dull
thing
in
the
world
,
for
there
be
not
a
soul
at
Clifton
at
this
time
of
year
.
<EOS>
Belle
go
with
your
brother
,
and
John
drive
Maria
.

"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
speak
the
pleasure
she
really
feel
on
hear
this
part
of
the
arrangement
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
"
rejoin
the
other
,
"
Maria
be
go
.
<EOS>
She
be
quite
wild
to
go
.
<EOS>
She
think
it
would
be
something
very
fine
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
I
admire
her
taste
;
and
for
my
part
,
I
be
determine
from
the
first
not
to
go
,
if
they
press
me
ever
so
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
,
a
little
doubtful
of
this
,
could
not
help
answer
,
"
I
wish
you
could
have
go
too
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
you
could
not
all
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
;
but
it
be
quite
a
matter
of
indifference
to
me
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
would
not
have
go
on
any
account
.
<EOS>
I
be
say
so
to
Emily
and
Sophia
when
you
overtook
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
be
still
unconvinced
;
but
glad
that
Anne
should
have
the
friendship
of
an
Emily
and
a
Sophia
to
console
her
,
she
bid
her
adieu
without
much
uneasiness
,
and
return
home
,
please
that
the
party
have
not
be
prevent
by
her
refusing
to
join
it
,
and
very
heartily
wish
that
it
may
be
too
pleasant
to
allow
either
James
or
Isabella
to
resent
her
resistance
any
longer
.
    
<EOS>
early
the
next
day
,
a
note
from
Isabella
,
speak
peace
and
tenderness
in
every
line
,
and
entreat
the
immediate
presence
of
her
friend
on
a
matter
of
the
utmost
importance
,
hasten
Catherine
,
in
the
happy
state
of
confidence
and
curiosity
,
to
Edgar
's
building
.
<EOS>
the
two
young
Miss
Thorpes
be
by
themselves
in
the
parlour
;
and
,
on
Anne
's
quit
it
to
call
her
sister
,
Catherine
take
the
opportunity
of
ask
the
other
for
some
particular
of
their
yesterday
's
party
.
<EOS>
Maria
desire
no
great
pleasure
than
to
speak
of
it
;
and
Catherine
immediately
learn
that
it
have
be
altogether
the
most
delightful
scheme
in
the
world
,
that
nobody
could
imagine
how
charming
it
have
be
,
and
that
it
have
be
more
delightful
than
anybody
could
conceive
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
information
of
the
first
five
minute
;
the
second
unfolded
thus
much
in
detail
 
that
they
have
drive
directly
to
the
York
Hotel
,
eat
some
soup
,
and
bespoke
an
early
dinner
,
walk
down
to
the
pump
-
room
,
taste
the
water
,
and
lay
out
some
shilling
in
purse
and
spar
;
thence
adjourn
to
eat
ice
at
a
pastry
-
cook
's
,
and
hurry
back
to
the
hotel
,
swallow
their
dinner
in
haste
,
to
prevent
be
in
the
dark
;
and
then
have
a
delightful
drive
back
,
only
the
moon
be
not
up
,
and
it
rain
a
little
,
and
Mr.
Morland
's
horse
be
so
tired
he
could
hardly
get
it
along
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
listen
with
heartfelt
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
It
appear
that
Blaize
Castle
have
never
be
think
of
;
and
,
as
for
all
the
rest
,
there
be
nothing
to
regret
for
half
an
instant
.
<EOS>
Maria
's
intelligence
conclude
with
a
tender
effusion
of
pity
for
her
sister
Anne
,
whom
she
represent
as
insupportably
cross
,
from
be
exclude
the
party
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
never
forgive
me
,
I
be
sure
;
but
,
you
know
,
how
could
I
help
it
?
<EOS>
John
would
have
me
go
,
for
he
vow
he
would
not
drive
her
,
because
she
have
such
thick
ankle
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
she
will
not
be
in
good
humour
again
this
month
;
but
I
be
determined
I
will
not
be
cross
;
it
be
not
a
little
matter
that
put
me
out
of
temper
.
"
  
<EOS>
Isabella
now
enter
the
room
with
so
eager
a
step
,
and
a
look
of
such
happy
importance
,
as
engage
all
her
friend
's
notice
.
<EOS>
Maria
be
without
ceremony
send
away
,
and
Isabella
,
embrace
Catherine
,
thus
begin
:
"
yes

my
dear
Catherine
,
it
be
so
indeed
;
your
penetration

<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
that
arch
eye
of
yours

<EOS>
It

through
everything

<EOS>
Catherine
reply
only
by
a
look
of
wonder
ignorance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay

my
beloved
,
sweetest
friend
,
"
continue
the
other

"
compose
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
be
amazingly
agitate
,
as
you
perceive
.
<EOS>
let
us
sit
down
and
talk
in
comfort
.
<EOS>
well
,
and
so
you
guess
it
the
moment
you
have
my
note
?
<EOS>
sly
creature
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
My
dear
Catherine
,
you
alone
,
who
know
my
heart

can
judge
of
my
present
happiness

<EOS>
Your
brother
be
the
most
charming
of
man
.
<EOS>
I
only
wish
I
be
more
worthy
of
him
.
<EOS>
but
what
will
your
excellent
father
and
mother
say
?
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Heavens
!
<EOS>
when
I
think
of
them
I
be
so
agitated

<EOS>
Catherine
's
understanding
begin
to
awake
:
an
idea
of
the
truth
suddenly
dart
into
her
mind
;
and
,
with
the
natural
blush
of
so
new
an
emotion
,
she
cry
out
,
"
good
heaven
!
<EOS>
My
dear
Isabella
,
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
Can
you
 
can
you
really
be
in
love
with
James
?
"
  
<EOS>
this
bold
surmise
,
however
,
she
soon
learn
<EOS>
comprehend
but
half
the
fact
.
<EOS>
the
anxious
affection
,
which
she
be
accuse
of
have
continually
watch
in
Isabella
's
every
look
and
action
,
have
,
in
the
course
of
their
yesterday
's
party
,
receive
the
delightful
confession
of
an
equal
love
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
and
faith
be
alike
engage
to
James
.
<EOS>
never
have
Catherine
listen
to
anything
so
full
of
interest
,
wonder
,
and
joy
.
<EOS>
Her
brother
and
her
friend
engage
!
<EOS>
new
to
such
circumstance
,
the
importance
of
it
appear
unspeakably
great
,
and
she
contemplate
it
as
one
of
those
grand
event
,
of
which
the
ordinary
course
of
life
can
hardly
afford
a
return
.
<EOS>
the
strength
of
her
feeling
she
could
not
express
;
the
nature
of
them
,
however
,
content
her
friend
.
<EOS>
the
happiness
of
have
such
a
sister
be
their
first
effusion
,
and
the
fair
lady
mingle
in
embrace
and
tear
of
joy

<EOS>
delighting
,
however
,
as
Catherine
sincerely
do
in
the
prospect
of
the
connection
,
it
must
be
acknowledge
that
Isabella
far
surpass
her
in
tender
anticipation
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
so
infinitely
dearer
to
me
,
my
Catherine
,
than
either
Anne
or
Maria
:
I
feel
that
I
shall
be
so
much
more
attached
to
my
dear
Morland
's
family
than
to
my
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
pitch
of
friendship
beyond
Catherine
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
so
like
your

continue
Isabella

"
that
I
quite
dote
on
you
the
first
moment
I
see
you

<EOS>
but
so
it
always
be
with
me

the
first
moment
settle
everything
.
<EOS>
the
very
first
day
that
Morland
come
to
us
last
Christmas
 
<EOS>
the
very
first
moment
I
beheld
him
 
<EOS>
my
heart
be
irrecoverably
go

<EOS>
I
remember
I
wear
my
yellow
gown
,
with
my
hair
do
up
in
braid
;
and
when
I
come
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
John
introduce
him
,
I
think
I
never
see
anybody
so
handsome
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
Catherine
secretly
acknowledge
the
power
of
love
;
for
,
though
exceedingly
fond
of
her
brother
,
and
partial
to
all
his
endowment
,
she
have
never
in
her
life

him
handsome

<EOS>
"
I
remember
too
,
Miss
Andrews
drink
tea
with
us
that
evening
,
and
wear
her
puce

coloured
sarsenet
;
and
she
look
so
heavenly
that
I
think
your
brother
must
certainly
fall
in
love
with
her
;
I
could
not
sleep
a
wink
all
right
for
thinking
of
it
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Catherine
,
the
many
sleepless
night
I

half
what
I

wretchedly
thin

I
will
not

I
feel
that
I

myself
perpetually
 
so
unguarded
in

of
my
partiality

the
church

my
secret

always
sure
would
be
safe

Catherine
feel
that
nothing
could
have
be
safe

ashamed
of
an
ignorance
little
expect
,
she
dare
no
longer
contest
the
point
,
nor

Her

Fullerton

known
his
situation

consent

here
be
a
source
of
some
real
agitation
to
the
mind
of
Isabella

<EOS>
Catherine
endeavour
to
persuade
her
,
as
she
be
herself
persuade
,
that
her
father

mother
would
never
oppose
their
son

wish

"
It
be
impossible

say
she
,
"
for
parent
to
be
more
kind

more
desirous

happiness

their
consenting

exactly
the

reply
Isabella
;
"
and
yet
I
dare
not
expect
it
;
my
fortune
will
be
so
small
;
they
never
can
consent
to
it
.

Your
brother

who
may
marry
anybody
!

<EOS>
here
Catherine
again
discern
the
force
of
love

<EOS>
"
indeed
,
Isabella
,
you
be
too
humble
.
<EOS>
the
difference
of
fortune
can
be
nothing
to
signify
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
My
sweet
Catherine
,
in
your
generous
heart
I
know
it
would
signify
nothing
;
but
we
must
not
expect
such
disinterestedness
in
many
.
<EOS>
as
for
myself
,
I
be
sure
I
only
wish
our
situation
be
reverse
.
<EOS>
have
I
the
command
of
million
,
be
I
mistress
of
the
whole
world
,
your
brother
would
be
my
only
choice
.

"
  
<EOS>
this
charming
sentiment

recommend
as
much
by
sense
as
novelty

give
Catherine
a
most
pleasing
remembrance
of
all
the
heroine
of
her
acquaintance

she
think
her
friend
never
look
more
lovely
than
in
utter
the
grand
idea

I
be
sure
they
will
consent

her
frequent
declaration

be
sure
they
will
be
delighted
with
you

for
my
own
part

say
Isabella
,
"
<EOS>
my
wish
be
so
moderate
that
the
small
income
in
nature
would
be
enough
for
me
.
<EOS>
where
people
be
really
attach
,
poverty
itself
be
wealth
;
grandeur
I
detest
:
I
would
not
settle
in
London
for
the
universe

<EOS>
a
cottage
in

be
ecstasy

charming
little
villas

You

I
shall
be
satisfied

idle
talking

I
will
not
allow
myself
to

of
such
thing

your

answer

morland
say
that
by
send
it
tonight
to
Salisbury

we
may
have
it
tomorrow

<EOS>
tomorrow
?
<EOS>
I
know
I
shall
never

I

when
Isabella

on
the
quality

gown

Their
conference

that

<EOS>
give
me

a

cheerful

let
me
only
have
the
company

I.

I
be
heartily
glad
to
hear
you
say
the
same

<EOS>
but
I
have
a
notion
,
<EOS>
Miss
Morland
,
you
and
I
think
pretty
much
alike
upon
most
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
we
may
;
but
it
be
more
than
I
ever
think
of
.
<EOS>
and
as
to
most
matter
,
to
say
the
truth
,
there
be
not
many
that
I
know
my
own
mind
about
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
by
Jove
,
no
more
do
I.
<EOS>
It
be
not
my
way
to
bother
my
brain
with
what
do
not
concern
me
.
<EOS>
My
notion
of
thing
be
simple
enough
.
<EOS>
let
me
only
have
the
girl
I
like
<EOS>
,
say
I
,
with
a
comfortable
house
over
my
head
,
and
what
care
I
for
all
the
rest
?
<EOS>
Fortune
be
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
of
a
good
income
of
my
own
;
and
if
she
have
not
a
penny
,
why
,
so
much
the
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
true
.
<EOS>
I
think
like
you
there
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
a
good
fortune
on
one
side
,
there
can
be
no
occasion
for
any
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
no
matter
which
have
it
,
so
that
there
be
enough
.
<EOS>
I
hate
the
idea
of
one
great
fortune
look
out
for
another
.
<EOS>
and
to
marry
for
money
I
think
the
wicked
thing
in
existence
.
<EOS>
good
day

We
shall
be
very
glad

see
you
at
Fullerton

it

away
she
go

It

<EOS>
with
such

such
a
visit

her
departure
be
not

anything

she
hurry
away

leave
him
to
the
undivided
consciousness
of
his
own
happy
address

her
explicit
encouragement

<EOS>
the
agitation
which
she
have
herself
experience
on
first
learn
her

both
ever
since
her
brother
's
arrival
;
and
all
that
they
feel
on
the
occasion
be
comprehend
in
a
wish
for
the
young
people
's
happiness
,
with
a
remark
,
on
the
gentleman
's
side
,
in
favour
of
Isabella
's
beauty
,
and
on
the
lady
's
,
of
her
great
good
luck
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
catherine
the
most
surprising
insensibility
.
<EOS>
the
disclosure
,
however
,
of
the
great
secret
of
James
's
go
to
Fullerton
the
day
before
,
do
raise
some
emotion
in
Mrs.
Allen
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
listen
to
that
with
perfect
calmness
,
but
repeatedly
regret
the
necessity
of
its
concealment
,
wish
she
could
have
know
his
intention
,
<EOS>
wish
she
could
have
see
him
before
he
go
,
as
she
should
certainly
have
trouble
him
with
her
good
regard
to
his
father
and
mother
,
and
her
kind
compliment
to
all
the
Skinners
.
    
<EOS>
Catherine
's
expectation
of
pleasure
from
her
visit
in
Milsom
Street
be
so
very
high
that
disappointment
be
inevitable
;
and
accordingly
,
though
she
be
most
politely
receive
by
General
Tilney
,
and
kindly
welcome
by
his
daughter
,
though
Henry
be
at
home
,
and
no
one
else
of
the
party
,
she
find
,
on
her
return
,
without
spend
many
hour
in
the
examination
of
her
feeling
,
that
she
have
go
to
her
appointment
prepare
for
happiness
which
it
have
not
afford
.
<EOS>
instead
of
find
herself
improve
in
acquaintance
with
Miss
Tilney
,
from
the
intercourse
of
the
day
,
she
seem
hardly
so
intimate
with
her
as
before
;
instead
of
see
Henry
Tilney
to
great
advantage
than
ever
,
in
the
ease
of
a
family
party
,
he
have
never
say
so
little
,
nor
be
so
little
agreeable
;
and
,
in
spite
of
their
father
's
great
civility
to
her
 
in
spite
of
his
thank
,
invitation
,
and
compliment
 
it
have
be
a
release
to
get
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
It
puzzle
her
to
account
for
all
this
.
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
General
Tilney
's
fault
.
<EOS>
that
he
be
perfectly
agreeable
and
good
-
natured
,
and
altogether
a
very
charming
man
,
do
not
admit
of
a
doubt
,
for
he
be
tall
and
handsome
,
and
Henry
's
father
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
accountable
for
his
child
's
want
of
spirit
,
or
for
her
want
of
enjoyment
in
his
company
.
<EOS>
the
former
she
hope
at
last
may
have
be
accidental
,
and
the
latter
she
could
only
attribute
to
her
own
stupidity
.
<EOS>
Isabella
,
on
hear
the
particular
of
the
visit
,
give
a
different
explanation
:
"
It
be
all
pride
,
pride
,
insufferable
haughtiness
and
pride
!
<EOS>
She
have
long
suspect
the
family
to
be
very
high
,
and
this
make
it
certain
.
<EOS>
such
insolence
of
behaviour
as
Miss
Tilney
's
she
have
never
hear
of
in
her
life
!
<EOS>
not
to
do
the
honour
of
her
house
with
common
good
breeding
!
<EOS>
to
behave
to
her
guest
with
such
superciliousness
!
<EOS>
hardly
even
to
speak
to
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
not
so
bad
as
that
,
Isabella
;
there
be
no
superciliousness
;
she
be
very
civil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
do
not
defend
her
!
<EOS>
and
then
the
brother
,
he
,
who
have
appear
so
attached
to
you
!
<EOS>
good
heaven
!
<EOS>
well
,
some
people
's
feeling
be
incomprehensible
.
<EOS>
and
so
he
hardly
look
once
at
you
the
whole
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
say
so
;
but
he
do
not
seem
in
good
spirit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
contemptible
!
<EOS>
of
all
thing
in
the
world
inconstancy
be
my
aversion
.
<EOS>
let
me
entreat
you
never
to
think
of
him
again
,
my
dear
Catherine
;
indeed
he
be
unworthy
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
unworthy
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
he
ever
think
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
exactly
what
I
say
;
he
never
think
of
you
.
<EOS>
such
fickleness
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
different
to
your
brother
and
to
mine
!
<EOS>
I
really
believe
John
have
the
most
constant
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
as
for
General
Tilney
,
I
assure
you
it
would
be
impossible
for
anybody
to
behave
to
me
with
great
civility
and
attention
;
it
seem
to
be
his
only
care
to
entertain
and
make
me
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
I
know
no
harm
of
him
;
I
do
not
suspect
him
of
pride
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
be
a
very
gentleman
-
like
man
.
<EOS>
John
think
very
well
of
him
,
and
John
's
judgment
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
well
,
I
shall
see
how
they
behave
to
me
this
evening
;
we
shall
meet
them
at
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
must
I
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
intend
it
?
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
all
settle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
since
you
make
such
a
point
of
it
,
I
can
refuse
you
nothing
.
<EOS>
but
do
not
insist
upon
my
be
very
agreeable
,
for
my
heart
<EOS>
,
you
know
,
will
be
some
forty
mile
off
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
dancing
,
do
not
mention
it
,
I
beg
;
that
be
quite
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
Charles
Hodges
will
plague
me
to
death
,
I
dare
say
;
but
I
shall
cut
him
very
short
.
<EOS>
ten
to
one
<EOS>
but
he
guess
the
reason
,
and
that
be
exactly
what
I
want
to
avoid
,
so
I
shall
insist
on
his
keep
his
conjecture
to
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Isabella
's
opinion
of
the
Tilneys
do
not
influence
her
friend
;
she
be
sure
there
have
be
no
insolence
in
the
manner
either
of
brother
or
sister
;
and
she
do
not
credit
there
be
any
pride
in
their
heart
.
<EOS>
the
evening
reward
her
confidence
;
she
be
meet
by
one
with
the
same
kindness
,
and
by
the
other
with
the
same
attention
,
as
heretofore
:
Miss
Tilney
take
pain
to
be
near
her
,
and
Henry
ask
her
to
dance
.
  
<EOS>
have
hear
the
day
before
in
Milsom
Street
that
their
eld
brother
,
Captain
Tilney
,
be
expect
almost
every
hour
,
she
be
at
no
loss
for
the
name
of
a
very
fashionable
-
looking
,
handsome
young
man
,
whom
she
have
never
see
before
,
and
who
now
evidently
belong
to
their
party
.
<EOS>
She
look
at
him
with
great
admiration
,
and
even
suppose
it
possible
that
some
people
may
think
him
handsomer
than
his
brother
,
though
,
in
her
eye
,
his
air
be
more
assuming
,
and
his
countenance
less
prepossessing
.
<EOS>
His
taste
and
manner
be
beyond
a
doubt
decidedly
inferior
;
for
,
within
her
hearing
,
he
not
only
protest
against
every
thought
of
dance
himself
,
but
even
laugh
openly
at
Henry
for
find
it
possible
.
<EOS>
from
the
latter
circumstance
it
may
be
presume
that
,
whatever
may
be
our
heroine
's
opinion
of
him
,
his
admiration
of
her
be
not
of
a
very
dangerous
kind
;
not
likely
to
produce
animosity
between
the
brother
,
nor
persecution
to
the
lady
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
be
the
instigator
of
the
three
villain
in
horseman
's
greatcoat
,
by
whom
she
will
hereafter
be
force
into
a
traveling
-
chaise
and
four
,
which
will
drive
off
with
incredible
speed
.
<EOS>
catherine
,
meanwhile
,
undisturbed
by
presentiment
of
such
an
evil
,
or
of
any
evil
at
all
,
except
that
of
have
but
a
short
set
to
dance
down
,
enjoy
her
usual
happiness
with
Henry
Tilney
,
listen
with
sparkle
eye
to
everything
he
say
;
and
,
in
find
him
irresistible
,
become
so
herself
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
the
first
dance
,
Captain
Tilney
come
towards
them
again
,
and
,
much
to
Catherine
's
dissatisfaction
,
pull
his
brother
away
.
<EOS>
They
retire
whisper
together
;
and
,
though
her
delicate
sensibility
do
not
take
immediate
alarm
,
and
lie
it
down
as
fact
,
that
Captain
Tilney
must
have
hear
some
malevolent
misrepresentation
of
her
,
which
he
now
hasten
to
communicate
to
his
brother
,
in
the
hope
of
separate
them
forever
,
she
could
not
have
her
partner
convey
from
her
sight
without
very
uneasy
sensation
.
<EOS>
Her
suspense
be
of
full
five
minute
'
duration
;
and
she
be
begin
to
think
it
a
very
long
quarter
of
an
hour
,
when
they
both
return
,
and
an
explanation
be
give
,
by
Henry
's
request
to
know
if
she
think
her
friend
,
Miss
Thorpe
,
would
have
any
objection
to
dancing
,
as
his
brother
would
be
most
happy
to
be
introduce
to
her
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
without
hesitation
,
reply
that
she
be
very
sure
<EOS>
Miss
Thorpe
do
not
mean
to
dance
at
all
.
<EOS>
the
cruel
reply
be
pass
on
to
the
other
,
and
he
immediately
walk
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
brother
will
not
mind
it
,
I
know
,
"
say
she
,
"
because
I
hear
him
say
before
that
he
hate
dancing
;
but
it
be
very
good
-
natured
in
him
to
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
see
Isabella
sit
down
,
and
fancy
she
may
wish
for
a
partner
;
but
he
be
quite
mistaken
,
for
she
would
not
dance
upon
any
account
in
the
world
.
"
  
<EOS>
Henry
smile
,
and
say
,
"
how
very
little
trouble
it
can
give
you
to
understand
the
motive
of
other
people
's
action
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
?
<EOS>
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
with
you
,
it
be
not
,
how
be
such
a
one
likely
to
be
influence

what
be
the
inducement
most
likely
to
act
upon
such
a
person
's
feeling
,
age
,
situation
,
and
probable
habit
of

consider
 
<EOS>

,
how
should
I
be
influence
<EOS>
,
what
would
be
my
inducement
in
act
so
and
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
we
be
on
very
unequal
term
,
for
I
understand
you
perfectly
well

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Me
?
<EOS>
yes
;
I
can
not
speak
well
enough
to
be
unintelligible

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bravo
!
<EOS>
an
excellent
satire
on
modern
language

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
pray
tell
me
what
you
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
indeed
?
<EOS>
do
you
really
desire
it
?
<EOS>
but
you
be
not
aware
of
the
consequence
;
it
will
involve
you
in
a
very
cruel
embarrassment
,
and
certainly
bring
on
a
disagreement
between
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
;
it
shall
not
do
either
;
I
be
not
afraid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
I
only
mean
that
your
attribute
my
brother
's
wish
of
dancing
with
Miss
Thorpe
to
good
nature
alone
convince
me
of
your
be
superior
in
good
nature
yourself
to
all
the
rest
of
the
world
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
blushed
and
disclaim
,
and
the
gentleman
's
prediction
be
verify
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
something
,
however
,
in
his
word
which
repay
her
for
the
pain
of
confusion
;
and
that
something
occupy
her
mind
so
much
that
she
draw
back
for
some
time
,
forget
to
speak
or
to
listen
,
and
almost
forget
where
she
be
;
till
,
rouse
by
the
voice
of
Isabella
,
she
look
up
and
see
her
with
Captain
Tilney
prepare
to
give
them
hand
across
.
  
<EOS>
Isabella
shrug
her
shoulder
and
smile
,
the
only
explanation
of
this
extraordinary
change
which
could
at
that
time
be
give
;
but
as
it
be
not
quite
enough
for
Catherine
's
comprehension
,
she
speak
her
astonishment
in
very
plain
term
to
her
partner
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
think
how
it
could
happen
!
<EOS>
Isabella
be
so
determined
not
to
dance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
Isabella
never
change
her
mind
before
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
but
,
because
 
and
your
brother
!
<EOS>
after
what
you
tell
him
from
me
,
how
could
he
think
of
go
to
ask
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
take
surprise
to
myself
on
that
head
.
<EOS>
You
bid
me
be
surprised
on
your
friend
's
account
,
and
therefore
I
be
;
but
as
for
my
brother
,
his
conduct
in
the
business
,
I
must
own
,
<EOS>
have
be
no
more
than
I
believe
him
perfectly
equal
to
.
<EOS>
the
fairness
of
your
friend
be
an
open
attraction
;
her
firmness
,
you
know
,
could
only
be
understand
by
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
laugh
;
but
,
I
assure
you
,
Isabella
be
very
firm
in
general
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
as
much
as
should
be
say
of
anyone
.
<EOS>
to
be
always
firm
must
be
to
be
often
obstinate
.
<EOS>
when
properly
to
relax
be
the
trial
of
judgment
;
and
,
without
reference
to
my
brother
,
I
really
think
Miss
Thorpe
have
by
no
means
choose
ill
in
fix
on
the
present
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
friend
be
not
able
to
get
together
for
any
confidential
discourse
till
all
the
dancing
be
over
;
but
then
,
as
they
walk
about
the
room
arm
in
arm
,
Isabella
thus
explain
herself
:
"
I
do
not
wonder
at
your
surprise
;
and
I
be
really
fatigued
to
death
.
<EOS>
He
be
such
a
rattle
!
<EOS>
amuse
enough
,
if
my
mind
have
be
disengage
;
but
I
would
have
give
the
world
to
sit
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
why
do
not
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
My
dear
!
<EOS>
It
would
have
look
so
particular
;
and
you
know
how
I
abhor
do
that
.
<EOS>
I
refuse
him
as
long
as
I
possibly
could
,
but
he
would
take
no
denial
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
idea
how
he
press
me
.
<EOS>
I
beg
him
to
excuse
me
,
and
get
some
other
partner
 
<EOS>
but
no
,
not
he
;
after
aspire
to
my
hand
,
there
be
nobody
else
in
the
room
he
could
bear
to
think
of
;
and
it
be
not
that
he
want
merely
to
dance
<EOS>
,
he
want
to
be
with
me
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
such
nonsense
!
<EOS>
I
tell
him
he
have
take
a
very
unlikely
way
to
prevail
upon
me
;
for
,
of
all
thing

It

memorial
of
an
injured
and
ill
-
fate
nun
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
wonderful
that
her
friend
should
seem
so
little
elated
by
the
possession
of
such
a
home
,
that
the
consciousness
of
it
should
be
so
meekly
borne
.
<EOS>
the
power
of
early
habit
only
could
account
for
it
.
<EOS>
a
distinction
to
which
they
have
be
bear
give
no
pride
.
<EOS>
Their
superiority
of
abode
be
no
more
to
them
than
their
superiority
of
person
.
  
<EOS>
many
be
the
inquiry
she
be
eager
to
make
of
Miss
Tilney
;
but
so
active
be
her
thought
,
that
when
these
inquiry
be
answer
,
she
be
hardly
more
assured
than
before
,
of
<EOS>
Northanger
Abbey
have
be
a
richly
endow
convent
at
the
time
of
the
Reformation
,
of
its
have
fall
into
the
hand
of
an
ancestor
of
the
Tilneys
on
its
dissolution
,
of
a
large
portion
of
the
ancient
building
still
make
a
part
of
the
present
dwell
although
the
rest
be
decay
,
or
of
its
standing
low
in
a
valley
,
shelter
from
the
north
and
east
by
rise
wood
of
oak
.
    
<EOS>
with
a
mind
thus
full
of
happiness
,
Catherine
be
hardly
aware
that
two
or
three
day
have
pass
away
,
without
her
see
Isabella
for
more
than
a
few
minute
together
.
<EOS>
She
begin
first
to
be
sensible
of
this
,
and
to
sigh
for
her
conversation
,
as
she
walk
along
the
pump
-
room
one
morning
,
by
Mrs.
Allen
's
side
,
without
anything
to
say
or
to
hear
;
and
scarcely
have
she
feel
a
five
minute
'
longing
of
friendship
,
before
the
object
of
it
appear
,
and
invite
her
to
a
secret
conference
,
lead
the
way
to
a
seat
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
be
my
favourite
place
,
"
say
she
as
they
sit
down
on
a
bench
between
the
door
,
which
command
a
tolerable
view
of
everybody
enter
at
either
;
"
it
be
so
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
,
observe
that
Isabella
's
eye
be
continually
bent
towards
one
door
or
the
other
,
as
in
eager
expectation
,
and
remember
how
often
she
have
be
falsely
accuse
of
be
arch
,
think
the
present
a
fine
opportunity
for
be
really
so
;
and
therefore
gaily
say
,
"
do
not
be
uneasy
,
Isabella
,
James
will
soon
be
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Psha
!
<EOS>
My
dear
creature
,
"
she
reply
,
"
do
not
think
me
such
a
simpleton
as
to
be
always
want
to
confine
him
to
my
elbow
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
hideous
to
be
always
together
;
we
should
be
the
jest
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
and
so
you
be
go
to
Northanger
!
<EOS>
I
be
amazingly
glad
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
the
fine
old
place
in
England
,
I
understand
.
<EOS>
I
shall
depend
upon
a
most
particular
description
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
certainly
have
the
good
in
my
power
to
give
.
<EOS>
but
who
be
you
look
for
?
<EOS>
be
your
sister
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
look
for
anybody
.
<EOS>
one
's
eye
must
be
somewhere
,
and
you
know
what
a
foolish
trick
I
have
of
fix
mine
,
when
my
thought
be
an
hundred
mile
off
.
<EOS>
I
be
amazingly
absent
;
I
believe
I
be
the
most
absent
creature
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Tilney
say
it
be
always
the
case
with
mind
of
a
certain
stamp
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
think
,
Isabella
,
you
have
something
in
particular
to
tell
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
<EOS>
and
so
I
have
.
<EOS>
but
here
be
a
proof
of
what
I
be
say
.
<EOS>
My
poor
head
,
I
have
quite
forget
it
.
<EOS>
well
,
the
thing
be
this
:
I
have
just
have
a
letter
from
John
;
you
can
guess
the
content
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
,
I
can
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
sweet
love
,
do
not
be
so
abominably
affect
.
<EOS>
what
can
he
write
about
,
but
yourself
?
<EOS>
You
know
he
be
over
head
and
ear
in
love
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
with
me
,
dear
Isabella
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
my
sweetest
Catherine
,
this
be
be
quite
absurd
!
<EOS>
Modesty
,
and
all
that
,
be
very
well
in
its
way
,
but
really
a
little
common
honesty
be
sometimes
quite
as
become
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
idea
of
be
so
overstrained
!
<EOS>
It
be
fish
for
compliment
.
<EOS>
His
attention
be
such
as
a
child
must
have
notice
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
but
<EOS>
half
an
hour
before
he
leave
Bath
that
you
give
him
the
most
positive
encouragement
.
<EOS>
He
say
so
in
this
letter
,
say
that
he
as
good
as
make
you
an
offer
,
and
that
you
receive
his
advance
in
the
kind
way
;
and
now
he
want
me
to
urge
his
suit
,
and
say
all
manner
of
pretty
thing
to
you
.
<EOS>
so
it
be
in
vain
to
affect
ignorance
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
,
with
all
the
earnestness
of
truth
,
express
her
astonishment
at
such
a
charge
,
protest
her
innocence
of
every
thought
of
Mr.
Thorpe
's
be
in
love
with
her
,
and
the
consequent
impossibility
of
her
have
ever
intend
to
encourage
him
.
"
<EOS>
as
to
any
attention
on
his
side
,
I
do
declare
,
upon
my
honour
,
I
never
be
sensible
of
them
for
a
moment
 
except
just
his
ask
me
to
dance
the
first
day
of
his
coming
.
<EOS>
and
as
to
make
me
an
offer
,
or
anything
like
it
,
there
must
be
some
unaccountable
mistake
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
misunderstood
a
thing
of
that
kind
,
you
know
!
<EOS>
and
,
as
I
ever
wish
to
be
believe
,
I
solemnly
protest
that
no
syllable
of
such
a
nature
ever
pass
between
us
.
<EOS>
the
last
half
hour
before
he
go
away
!
<EOS>
It
must
be
all
and
completely
a
mistake
 
<EOS>
for
I
do
not
see
him
once
that
whole
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
that
you
certainly
do
,
for
you
spend
the
whole
morning
in
Edgar
's
building
 
<EOS>
it
be
the
day
your
father
's
consent
come
 
and
I
be
pretty
sure
that
you
and
John
be
alone
in
the
parlour
some
time
before
you
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
?
<EOS>
well
,
if
you
say
it
,
it
be
so
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
 
<EOS>
but
for
the
life
of
me
,
I
can
not
recollect
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
remember
now
be
with
you
,
and
see
him
as
well
as
the
rest
 
<EOS>
but
that
we
be
ever
alone
for
five
minute
 
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
not
worth
argue
about
,
for
whatever
may
pass
on
his
side
,
you
must
be
convince
,
by
my
have
no
recollection
of
it
,
that
I
never
think
,
nor
expect
,
nor
wish
for
anything
of
the
kind
from
him
.
<EOS>
I
be
excessively
concerned
that
he
should
have
any
regard
for
me
 
<EOS>
but
indeed
it
have
be
quite
unintentional
on
my
side
;
I
never
have
the
small
idea
of
it
.
<EOS>
pray
undeceive
him
as
soon
as
you
can
,
and
tell
him
I
beg
his
pardon
 
<EOS>
that
be
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
I
ought
to
say
 
but
make
him
understand
what
I
mean
,
in
the
proper
way
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
speak
disrespectfully
of
a
brother
of
yours
,
Isabella
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
;
but
you
know
very
well
that
if
I
could
think
of
one
man
more
than
another
 
<EOS>
he
be
not
the
person
.
<EOS>
"
Isabella
be
silent
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
,
you
must
not
be
angry
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
suppose
your
brother
care
so
very
much
about
me
.
<EOS>
and
,
you
know
,
we
shall
still
be
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
"
(
with
a
blush
)
,
"
there
be
more
way
than
one
of
our
be
sister
.
<EOS>
but
where
be
I
wander
to
?
<EOS>
well
,
my
dear
Catherine
,
the
case
seem
to
be
that
you
be
determine
against
poor
John
 
be
not
it
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
can
not
return
his
affection
,
and
as
certainly
never
mean
to
encourage
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
since
that
be
the
case
,
I
be
sure
I
shall
not
tease
you
any
further
.
<EOS>
John
desire
me
to
speak
to
you
on
the
subject
,
and
therefore
I
have
.
<EOS>
but
I
confess
,
as
soon
as
I
read
his
letter
,
I
think
it
a
very
foolish
,
imprudent
business
,
and
not
likely
to
promote
the
good
of
either
;
for
what
be
you
to
live
upon
,
suppose
you
come
together
?
<EOS>
You
have
both
of
you
something
,
to
be
sure
,
but
it
be
not
a
trifle
that
will
support
a
family
nowadays
;
and
after
all
that
romancer
may
say
,
there
be
no
do
without
money
.
<EOS>
I
only
wonder
John
could
think
of
it
;
he
could
not
have
receive
my
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
acquit
me
,
then
,
of
anything
wrong
?
 
<EOS>
You
be
convinced
that
I
never
mean
to
deceive
your
brother
,
never
suspect
him
of
like
me
till
this
moment
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
as
to
that
,
"
answer
Isabella
laughingly
,
"
I
do
not
pretend
to
determine
what
your
thought
and
design
in
time
past
may
have
be
.
<EOS>
all
that
be
best
known
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
a
little
harmless
flirtation
or
so
will
occur
,
and
one
be
often
draw
on
to
give
more
encouragement
than
one
wish
to
stand
by
.
<EOS>
but
you
may
be
assure
that
I
be
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
judge
you
severely
.
<EOS>
all
those
thing
should
be
allow
for
in
youth
and
high
spirit
.
<EOS>
what
one
mean
one
day
,
you
know

one
may
not
mean
the
next

circumstance
change
,
opinion
alter

<EOS>

my
opinion
of
your
brother
never
do
alter
;
it
be
always
the
same
.

You
be
describe
what
never
happen

"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
catherine
,
"
continue
the
other
without
at
all
listen
to
her
,
"
I
would
not
for
all
the
world
be
the
mean
of
hurry
you
into
an
engagement
before
you
know
what
you
be
about
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
anything
would
justify
me
in
wish
you
to
sacrifice
all
your
happiness
merely
to
oblige
my
brother
,
because
he
be
my
brother
,
and
who
perhaps
after
all
,
you
know
,
may
be
just
as
happy
without
you
,
for
people
seldom
know
what
they
would
be
at
,
young
man
especially
,
they
be
so
amazingly
changeable
and
inconstant

what
I
say
be
,
why
should
a
brother
's
happiness
be
dearer
to
me
than
a
friend
's
?
<EOS>
You
know
I
carry
my
notion
of
friendship
pretty
high

,
above
all
thing
,
my
dear
Catherine

do
not

in
a

take
my
word
for
it

that
if
you
be
in
too
great
a
hurry

you
will
certainly
live
to
repent
it

Tilney
say
there
be
nothing
people
be
so
often
deceive
in
as
the
state
of
their
own
affection

I
believe

be
very
right

ah
!

here
he
come

never

he

look
up

perceive
Captain
Tilney

earnestly
fix

eye
on

whisper

little

<EOS>
Catherine
hear
all
this
,
and
quite
out
of
countenance
,
could
listen
no
longer
.
<EOS>
amazed
that
Isabella
could
endure
it
,
and
jealous
for
her
brother
,
she
rise
up
,
and
say
she
should
join
Mrs.
Allen
,
propose
their
walking
.
<EOS>
but
for
this
Isabella
show
no
inclination
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
amazingly
tired
,
and
it
be
so
odious
to
parade
about
the
pump
-
room
;
and
if
she
move
from
her
seat
she
should
miss
her
sister
;
she
be
expect
her
sister
every
moment
;
so
that
her
dear
Catherine
must
excuse
her
,
and
must
sit
quietly
down
again
.
<EOS>
but
Catherine
could
be
stubborn
too
;
and
Mrs.
Allen
just
then
come
up
to
propose
their
return
home
,
she
join
her
and
walk
out
of
the
pump
-
room
,
leave
Isabella
still
sit
with
Captain
Tilney
.
<EOS>
with
much
uneasiness
do
she
thus
leave
them
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
her
that
Captain
Tilney
be
fall
in
love
with
Isabella
,
and
Isabella
unconsciously
encourage
him
;
unconsciously
it
must
be
,
for
Isabella
's
attachment
to
James
be
as
certain
and
well
acknowledge
as
her
engagement
.
<EOS>
to
doubt
her
truth
or
good
intention
be
impossible
;
and
yet
,
during
the
whole
of
their
conversation
her
manner
have
be
odd
.
<EOS>
She
wish
Isabella
have
talk
more
like
her
usual
self
,
and
not
so
much
about
money
,
and
have
not
look
so
well
pleased
at
the
sight
of
Captain
Tilney
.
<EOS>
how
strange
that
she
should
not
perceive
his
admiration
!
<EOS>
Catherine
long
to
give
her
a
hint
of
it
,
to
put
her
on
her
guard
,
and
prevent
all
the
pain
which
her
too
lively
behaviour
may
otherwise
create
both
for
him
and
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
the
compliment
of
John
Thorpe
's
affection
do
not
make
amend
for
this
thoughtlessness
in
his
sister
.
<EOS>
She
be
almost
as
far
from
believe
as
from
wish
it
to
be
sincere
;
for
she
have
not
forget
that
he
could
mistake
,
and
his
assertion
of
the
offer
and
of
her
encouragement
convince
her
that
his
mistake
could
sometimes
be
very
egregious
.
<EOS>
in
vanity
,
therefore
,
she
gain
but
little
;
her
chief
profit
be
in
wonder
.
<EOS>
that
he
should
think
it
worth
his
while
to
fancy
himself
in
love
with
her
<EOS>
be
a
matter
of
lively
astonishment
.
<EOS>
Isabella
talk
of
his
attention
;
she
have
never
be
sensible
of
any
;
but
Isabella
have
say
many
thing
which
she
hope
have
be
speak
in
haste
,
and
would
never
be
say
again
;
and
upon
this
she
be
glad
to
rest
altogether
for
present
ease
and
comfort
.
    
<EOS>
a
few
day
pass
away
,
and
Catherine
,
though
not
allow
herself
to
suspect
her
friend
,
could
not
help
watch
her
closely
.
<EOS>
the
result
of
her
observation
be
not
agreeable
.
<EOS>
Isabella
seem
an
alter
creature
.
<EOS>
when
she
see
her
,
indeed
,
surround
only
by
their
immediate
friend
in
Edgar
's
Buildings
or
Pulteney
Street
,
her
change
of
manner
be
so
trifling
that
,
have
it
go
no
farther
<EOS>
,
it
may
have
pass
unnoticed
.
<EOS>
a
something
of
languid
indifference
,
or
of
that
boasted
absence
of
mind
which
Catherine
have
never
hear
of
before
,
would
occasionally
come
across
her
;
but
have
nothing
bad
appear
,
that
may
only
have
spread
a
new
grace
and
inspire
a
warm
interest
.
<EOS>
but
when
Catherine
see
her
in
public
,
admit
Captain
Tilney
's
attention
as
readily
as
they
be
offer
,
and
allow
him
almost
an
equal
share
with
James
in
her
notice
and
smile
,
the
alteration
become
too
positive
to
be
pass
over
.
<EOS>
what
could
be
mean
by
such
unsteady
conduct
,
what
her
friend
could
be
at
,
be
beyond
her
comprehension
.
<EOS>
Isabella
could
not
be
aware
of
the
pain
she
be
inflict
;
but
it
be
a
degree
of
wilful
thoughtlessness
which
Catherine
could
not
but
resent
.
<EOS>
James
be
the
sufferer
.
<EOS>
She
see
him
grave
and
uneasy
;
and
however
careless
of
his
present
comfort
the
woman
may
be
who
have
give
him
her
heart
,
to
her
it
be
always
an
object
.
<EOS>
for
poor
Captain
Tilney
too
she
be
greatly
concerned
.
<EOS>
though
his
look
do
not
please
her
,
his
name
be
a
passport
to
her
goodwill
,
and
she
think
with
sincere
compassion
of
his
approach
disappointment
;
for
,
in
spite
of
what
she
have
believe
herself
to
overhear
in
the
pump
-
room
,
his
behaviour
be
so
incompatible
with
a
knowledge
of
Isabella
's
engagement
that
she
could
not
,
upon
reflection
,
imagine
him
aware
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
jealous
of
her
brother
as
a
rival
,
but
if
more
have
seem
imply
,
the
fault
must
have
be
in
her
misapprehension
.
<EOS>
She
wish
,
by
a
gentle
remonstrance
,
to
remind
Isabella
of
her
situation
,
and
make
her
aware
of
this
double
unkindness
;
but
for
remonstrance
,
either
opportunity
or
comprehension
be
always
against
her
.
<EOS>
if
able
to
suggest
a
hint
,
Isabella
could
never
understand
it
.
<EOS>
in
this
distress
,
the
intend
departure
of
the
Tilney
family
become
her
chief
consolation
;
their
journey
into
Gloucestershire
be
to
take
place
within
a
few
day
,
and
Captain
Tilney
's
removal
would
at
least
restore
peace
to
every
heart
but
his
own
.
<EOS>
but
Captain
Tilney
have
at
present
no
intention
of
remove
;
he
be
not
to
be
of
the
party
to
Northanger
;
he
be
to
continue
at
Bath
.
<EOS>
when
Catherine
know
this
,
her
resolution
be
directly
make
.
<EOS>
She
speak
to
Henry
Tilney
on
the
subject
,
regret
his
brother
's
evident
partiality
for
Miss
Thorpe
,
and
entreat
him
to
make
know
her
prior
engagement
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
brother
do
know
it
,
"
be
Henry
's
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
he
?
<EOS>
then
why
do
he
stay
here
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
make
no
reply
,
and
be
begin
to
talk
of
something
else
;
but
she
eagerly
continue
,
"
why
do
not
you
persuade
him
to
go
away
?
<EOS>
the
longer
he
stay
,
the
bad
it
will
be
for
him
at
last
.
<EOS>
pray
advise
him
for
his
own
sake
,
and
for
everybody
's
sake
,
to
leave
Bath
directly
.
<EOS>
absence
will
in
time
make
him
comfortable
again
;
but
he
can
have
no
hope
here
,
and
it
be
only
stay
to
be
miserable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Henry
smile
and
say
,
"
I
be
sure
my
brother
would
not
wish
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
will
persuade
him
to
go
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
persuasion
be
not
at
command
;
but
pardon
me
,
if
I
can
not
even
endeavour
to
persuade
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
myself
tell
him
that
Miss
Thorpe
be
engage
.
<EOS>
He
know
what
he
be
about
,
and
must
be
his
own
master
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
he
do
not
know
what
he
be
about
,
"
cry
Catherine
;
"
he
do
not
know
the
pain
he
be
give
my
brother
.
<EOS>
not
that
James
have
ever
tell
me
so
,
but
I
be
sure
he
be
very
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
be
you
sure
it
be
my
brother
's
do
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
very
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
my
brother
's
attention
to
Miss
Thorpe
,
or
Miss
Thorpe
's
admission
of
them
,
that
give
the
pain
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
not
it
the
same
thing
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
Mr.
Morland
would
acknowledge
a
difference
.
<EOS>
no
man
be
offend
by
another
man
's
admiration
of
the
woman
he
love
;
it
be
the
woman
only
who
can
make
it
a
torment
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
blush
for
her
friend
,
and
say
,
"
Isabella
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
sure
she
can
not
mean
to
torment
,
for
she
be
very
much
attach
to
my
brother
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
in
love
with
him
ever
since
they
first
meet
,
and
while
my
father
's
consent
be
uncertain
,
she
fret
herself
almost
into
a
fever
.
<EOS>
You
know
she
must
be
attach
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
:
she
be
in
love
with
James
,
and
flirt
with
Frederick
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
no
,
not
flirt
.
<EOS>
a
woman
in
love
with
one
man
can
not
flirt
with
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
probable
that
she
will
neither
love
so
well
,
nor
flirt
<EOS>
so
well
,
as
she
may
do
either
singly
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
must
each
give
up
a
little
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
a
short
pause
,
Catherine
resume
with
,
"
then
you
do
not
believe
Isabella
so
very
much
attach
to
my
brother
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
have
no
opinion
on
that
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
what
can
your
brother
mean
?
<EOS>
if
he
know
her
engagement
,
what
can
he
mean
by
his
behaviour
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
very
close
questioner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
I
?
<EOS>
I
only
ask
what
I
want
to

tell

"
  
<EOS>
"
but
do
you
only
ask
what
I
can
be
expect
to
tell
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
think
so
;
for
you
must
know
your
brother
's
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
brother
's
heart
,
as
you
term
it
,
on
the
present
occasion
,
I
assure
you
I
can
only
guess
at
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
nay
,
if
it
be
to
be
guesswork
,
let
us
all
guess
for
ourselves
.
<EOS>
to
be
guide
by
second
-
hand
conjecture
be
pitiful
.
<EOS>
the
premise
be
before
you
.
<EOS>
My
brother
be
a
lively
and
perhaps
sometimes
a
thoughtless
young
man
;
he
have
have
about
a
week
's
acquaintance
with
your
friend
,
and
he
have
know
her
engagement
almost
as
long
as
he
have
know
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Catherine
,
after
some
moment
'
consideration
,
"
you
may
be
able
to
guess
at
your
brother
's
intention
from
all
this
;
but
I
be
sure
I
can
not
.
<EOS>
but
be
not
your
father
uncomfortable
about
it
?
<EOS>
do
not
he
want
Captain
Tilney
to
go
away
?
<EOS>
sure
,
if
your
father
be
to
speak
to
him
,
he
would
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Miss
Morland
,
"
say
Henry
,
"
in
this
amiable
solicitude
for
your
brother
's
comfort
,
may
you
not
be
a
little
mistaken
?
<EOS>
be
you
not
carry
a
little
too
far
?
<EOS>
Would
he
thank
you
,
either
on
his
own
account
or
<EOS>
Miss
Thorpe
's
,
for
supposing
that
her
affection
,
or
at
least
her
good
behaviour
,
be
only
to
be
secure
by
her
see
nothing
of
Captain
Tilney
?
<EOS>
be
he
safe
only
in
solitude
?
<EOS>
or
be
her
heart
constant
to
him
only
when
unsolicite
by
anyone
else
?
<EOS>
He
can
not
think
this
 
<EOS>
and
you
may
be
sure
that
he
would
not
have
you
think
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
,
"
do
not
be
uneasy
,
"
because
I
know
that
you
be
so
,
at
this
moment
;
but
be
as
little
uneasy
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
doubt
of
the
mutual
attachment
of
your
brother
and
your
friend
;
depend
upon
it
,
therefore
,
that
real
jealousy
never
can
exist
between
them
;
depend
upon
it
that
no
disagreement
between
them
can
be
of
any
duration
.
<EOS>
Their
heart
be
open
to
each
other
,
as
neither
heart
can
be
to
you
;
they
know
exactly
what
be
require
and
what
can
be
bear
;
and
you
may
be
certain
that
one
will
never
tease
the
other
beyond
what
be
know
to
be
pleasant
.
"
  
<EOS>
perceive
her
still
to
look
doubtful
and
grave
,
he
add
,
"
though
Frederick
do
not
leave
Bath
with
us
,
he
will
probably
remain
but
a
very
short
time
,
perhaps
only
a
few
day
behind
us
.
<EOS>
His
leave
of
absence
will
soon
expire
,
and
he
must
return
to
his
regiment
.
<EOS>
and
what
will
then
be
their
acquaintance
?
<EOS>
the
mess
-
room
will
drink
Isabella
Thorpe
for
a
fortnight
,
and
she
will
laugh
with
your
brother
over
poor
Tilney
's
passion
for
a
month
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
would
contend
no
longer
against
comfort
.
<EOS>
She
have
resist
its
approach
during
the
whole
length
of
a
speech
,
but
it
now
carry
her
captive
.
<EOS>
Henry
Tilney
must
know
best
.
<EOS>
She
blame
herself
for
the
extent
of
her
fear
,
and
resolve
never
to
think
so
seriously
on
the
subject
again
.
  
<EOS>
Her
resolution
be
support
by
Isabella
's
behaviour
in
their
parting
interview
.
<EOS>
the
Thorpes
spend
the
last
evening
of
Catherine
's
stay
in
Pulteney
Street
,
and
nothing
pass
between
the
lover
to
excite
her
uneasiness
,
or
make
her
quit
them
in
apprehension
.
<EOS>
James
be
in
excellent
spirit
,
and
Isabella
most
engagingly
placid
.
<EOS>
Her
tenderness
for
her
friend
seem
rather
the
first
feeling
of
her
heart
;
but
that
at
such
a
moment
be
allowable
;
and
once
she
give
her
lover
a
flat
contradiction
,
and
once
she
draw
back
her
hand
;
but
Catherine
remember
Henry
's
instruction
,
and
place
it
all
to
judicious
affection
.
<EOS>
the
embrace
,
tear
,
and
promise
of
the
part
fair
one
may
be
fancy
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Allen
be
sorry
to
lose
their
young
friend
,
whose
good
humour
and
cheerfulness
have
make
her
a
valuable
companion
,
and
in
the
promotion
of
whose
enjoyment
their
own
have
be
gently
increase
.
<EOS>
Her
happiness
in
go
with
Miss
Tilney
,
however
,
prevent
their
wish
it
otherwise
;
and
,
as
they
be
to
remain
only
one
more
week
in
Bath
themselves
,
her
quit
them
now
would
not
long
be
feel
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Allen
attend
her
to
Milsom
Street
,
where
she
be
to
breakfast
,
and
see
her
seat
with
the
kind
welcome
among
her
new
friend
;
but
so
great
be
her
agitation
in
find
herself
as
one
of
the
family
,
and
so
fearful
be
she
of
not
do
exactly
what
be
right
,
and
of
not
be
able
to
preserve
their
good
opinion
,
that
,
in
the
embarrassment
of
the
first
five
minute
,
she
could
almost
have
wish
to
return
with
him
to
Pulteney
Street
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tilney
's
manner
and
Henry
's
smile
soon
do
away
some
of
her
unpleasant
feeling
;
but
still
she
be
far
from
be
at
ease
;
nor
could
the
incessant
attention
of
the
general
himself
entirely
reassure
her
.
<EOS>
nay
,
perverse
as
it
seem
,
she
doubt
whether
she
may
not
have
feel
less
,
have
she
be
less
attend
to
.
<EOS>
His
anxiety
for
her
comfort
 
<EOS>
his
continual
solicitation
that
she
would
eat
,
and
his
often
-
express
fear
of
her
see
nothing
to
her
taste
 
though
never
in
her
life
<EOS>
before
have
she
beheld
half
such
variety
on
a
breakfast
-
table
 
make
it
impossible
for
her
to
forget
for
a
moment
that
she
be
a
visitor
.
<EOS>
She
feel
utterly
unworthy
of
such
respect
,
and
know
not
how
to
reply
to
it
.
<EOS>
Her
tranquillity
be
not
improve
by
the
general
's
impatience
for
the
appearance
of
his
eld
son
,
nor
by
the
displeasure
he
express
at
his
laziness
when
Captain
Tilney
at
last
come
down
.
<EOS>
She
be
quite
pain
by
the
severity
of
his
father
's
reproof
,
which
seem
disproportionate
to
the
offence
;
and
much
be
her
concern
increase
when
she
find
herself
the
principal
cause
of
the
lecture
,
and
that
his
tardiness
be
chiefly
resent
from
be
disrespectful
to
her
.
<EOS>
this
be
place
her
in
a
very
uncomfortable
situation
,
and
she
feel
great
compassion
for
Captain
Tilney
,
without
be
able
to
hope
for
his
goodwill
.
  
<EOS>
He
listen
to
his
father
in
silence
,
and
attempt
not
any
defence
,
which
confirm
her
in
fear
that
the
inquietude
of
his
mind
,
on
Isabella
's
account
,
may
,
by
keep
him
long
sleepless
,
have
be
the
real
cause
of
<EOS>
his
rise
late
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
time
of
her
be
decidedly
in
his
company
,
and
she
have
hope
to
be
now
able
to
form
her
opinion
of
him
;
but
she
scarcely
hear
his
voice
while
his
father
remain
in
the
room
;
and
even
afterwards
,
so
much
be
his
spirit
affect
,
she
could
distinguish
nothing
but
these
word
,
in
a
whisper
to
Eleanor
,
"
how
glad
I
shall
be
when
you
be
all
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
bustle
of
go
be
not
pleasant
.
<EOS>
the
clock
strike
ten
while
the
trunk
be
carry
down
,
and
the
general
have
fix
to
be
out
of
Milsom
Street
by
that
hour
.
<EOS>
His
greatcoat
,
instead
of
be
bring
for
him
to
put
on
directly
,
be
spread
out
in
the
curricle
in
which
he
be
to
accompany
his
son
.
<EOS>
the
middle
seat
of
the
chaise
be
not
draw
out
,
though
there
be
three
people
to
go
in
it
,
and
his
daughter
's
maid
have
so
crowd
it
with
parcel
that
Miss
Morland
would
not
have
room
to
sit
;
and
,
so
much
be
he
influence
by
this
apprehension
when
he
hand
her
in
,
that
she
have
some
difficulty
in
save
her
own
new
writing
-
desk
from
be
throw
out
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
however
,
the
door
be
close
upon
the
three
female
,
and
they
set
off
at
the
sober
pace
in
which
the
handsome
,
highly
feed
four
horse
of
a
gentleman
usually
perform
a
journey
of
thirty
mile
:
<EOS>
such
be
the
distance
of
Northanger
from
Bath
,
to
be
now
divide
into
two
equal
stage
.
<EOS>
Catherine
's
spirit
revive
as
they
drive
from
the
door
;
for
with
Miss
Tilney
she
feel
no
restraint
;
and
,
with
the
interest
of
a
road
entirely
new
to
her
,
of
an
abbey
before
,
and
a
curricle
behind
,
she
catch
the
last
view
of
Bath
without
any
regret
,
and
meet
with
every
milestone
before
she
expect
it
.
<EOS>
the
tediousness
of
a
two
hour
'
wait
at
Petty
France
,
in
which
there
be
nothing
to
be
do
but
to
eat
without
be
hungry
,
and
loiter
about
without
anything
to
see
,
next
followed
 
and
her
admiration
of
the
style
in
which
they
travel
,
of
the
fashionable
chaise
and
four
 
postilion
handsomely
liverie
,
rise
so
regularly
in
their
stirrup
,
and
numerous
outrider
properly
mount
,
sink
a
little
under
this
consequent
inconvenience
.
<EOS>
have
their
party
be
perfectly
agreeable
,
the
delay
would
have
be
nothing
;
but
General
Tilney
,
though
so
charm
a
man
,
seem
always
a
check
upon
his
child
's
spirit
,
and
scarcely
anything
be
say
but
by
himself
;
the
observation
of
which
,
with
his
discontent
at
whatever
the
inn
afford
,
and
his
angry
impatience
at
the
waiter
,
make
Catherine
grow
every
moment
more
in
awe
of
him
,
and
appear
to
lengthen
the
two
hour
into
four
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
however
,
the
order
of
release
be
give
;
and
much
be
Catherine
then
surprise
by
the
general
's
proposal
of
her
take
his
place
in
his
son
's
curricle
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
:
"
the
day
be
fine
,
and
he
be
anxious
for
her
see
as
much
of
the
country
as
possible
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
remembrance
of
Mr.
Allen
's
opinion
,
respect
young
man
's
open
carriage
,
make
her
blush
at
the
mention
of
such
a
plan
,
and
her
first
thought
be
to
decline
it
;
but
her
second
be
of
great
deference
for
General
Tilney
's
judgment
;
he
could
not
propose
anything
improper
for
her
;
and
,
in
the
course
of
a
few
minute
,
she
find
herself
with
Henry
in
the
curricle
,
as
happy
a
being
as
ever
exist
.
<EOS>
a
very
short
trial
convince
her
that
a
curricle
be
the
prettiest
equipage
in
the
world
;
the
chaise
and
four
wheel
off
with
some
grandeur
,
to
be
sure
,
but
it
be
a
heavy
and
troublesome
business
,
and
she
could
not
easily
forget
its
have
stop
two
hour
at
Petty
France
.
<EOS>
half
the
time
would
have
be
enough
for
the
curricle
,
and
so
nimbly
be
the
light
horse
dispose
to
move
,
that
,
have
not
the
general
choose
to
have
his
own
carriage
lead
the
way
,
they
could
have
pass
it
with
ease
in
half
a
minute
.
<EOS>
but
the
merit
of
the
curricle
do
not
all
belong
to
the
horse
;
Henry
drive
so
well
 
<EOS>
so
quietly
 
without
make
any
disturbance
,
without
parade
to
her
,
or
swear
at
them
:
so
different
from
the
only
gentleman
-
coachman
whom
it
be
in
her
power
to
compare
him
with
!
<EOS>
and
then
his
hat
sit
so
well
,
and
the
innumerable
cape
of
his
greatcoat
look
so
becomingly
important
!
<EOS>
to
be
drive
by
him
,
next
to
be
dance
with
him
,
be
certainly
the
great
happiness
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
in
addition
to
every
other
delight
,
she
have
now
that
of
listen
to
her
own
praise
;
of
be
thank
at
least
,
on
his
sister
's
account
,
for
her
kindness
in
thus
become
her
visitor
;
of
hear
it
rank
as
real
friendship
,
and
describe
as
create
real
gratitude
.
<EOS>
His
sister
,
he
say
,
be
uncomfortably
circumstance
 
<EOS>
she
have
no
female
companion
 
and
,
in
the
frequent
absence
of
her
father
,
be
sometimes
without
any
companion
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
how
can
that
be
?
"
say
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
be
not
you
with
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Northanger
be
not
more
than
half
my
home
;
I
have
an
establishment
at
my
own
house
in
Woodston
,
which
be
nearly
twenty
mile
from
my
father
's
,
and
some
of
my
time
be
necessarily
spend
there

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
sorry
you
must
be
for
that

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
always
sorry
to
leave
Eleanor

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
but
besides
your
affection
for
her
,
you
must
be
so
fond
of
the
abbey
!
<EOS>
after
be
use
to
such
a
home
as
the
abbey
,
an
ordinary
parsonage
-
house
must
be
very
disagreeable
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
smile
,
and
say
,
"
You
have
form
a
very
favourable
idea
of
the
abbey

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
,
I
have
.
<EOS>
be
not
it
a
fine
old
place
,
just
like
what
one
read
about
?
"
  
"
and
be
you
prepared
to
encounter
all
the
horror
that
a
building
such
as
"
what
one
read
about
'
may
produce
?
<EOS>
have
you
a
stout
heart
?
<EOS>
nerve
fit
for
slide
panel
and
tapestry
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
I
should
be
easily
frightened
,
because
there
would
be
so
many
people
in
the
house
 
and
besides
,
it
have
never
be
uninhabite
and
leave
desert
for
year
,
and
then
the
family
come
back
to
it
unaware
,
without
give
any
notice
,
as
generally
happen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
We
shall
not
have
to
explore
our
way
into
a
hall
dimly
light
by
the
expire
ember
of
a
wood
fire
 
nor
be
oblige
to
spread
our
bed
on
the
floor
of
a
room
without
window
,
door
,
or
furniture
.
<EOS>
but
you
must
be
aware
that
when
a
young
lady
be
(
by
whatever
mean
)
introduce
into
a
dwelling
of
this
kind
<EOS>
,
she
be
always
lodge
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
while
they
snugly
repair
to
their
own
end
of
the
house
,
she
be
formally
conduct
by
Dorothy
,
the
ancient
housekeeper
,
up
a
different
staircase
,
and
along
many
gloomy
passage
,
into
an
apartment
never
use
since
some
cousin
or
kin
die
in
it
about
twenty
year
before
.
<EOS>
Can
you
stand
such
a
ceremony
as
this
?
<EOS>
Will
not
your
mind
misgive
you
when
you
find
yourself
in
this
gloomy
chamber
 
too
lofty
and
extensive
for
you
,
with
only
the
feeble
ray
of
a
single
lamp
to
take
in
its
size
 
its
wall
hang
with
tapestry
exhibit
figure
as
large
as
life
,
and
the
bed
,
of
dark
green
stuff

purple
velvet
,
present
even
a
funereal
appearance
?
<EOS>
Will
not
your
heart
sink
within
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
but
this
will
not
happen
to
me
,
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
fearfully
will
you
examine
the
furniture
of
your
apartment
!
<EOS>
and
what
will
you
discern
?
<EOS>
not
table
,
toilette
,
wardrobe
,
or
drawer
,
but
on
one
side
perhaps
the
remain
of
a
break
lute
,
on
the
other
a
ponderous
chest
which
no
effort
can
open
,
and
over
the
fireplace
the
portrait
of
some
handsome
warrior
,
whose
feature
will
so
incomprehensibly
strike
you
,
that
you
will
not
be
able
to
withdraw
your
eye
from
it
.
<EOS>
Dorothy
,
meanwhile
,
no
less
strike
by
your
appearance
,
gaze
on
you
in
great
agitation
,
and
drop
a
few
unintelligible
hint
.
<EOS>
to
raise
your
spirit
,
moreover
,
she
give
you
reason
to
suppose
that
the
part
of
the
abbey
you
inhabit
be
undoubtedly
haunted
,
and
inform
you
that
you
will
not
have
a
single
domestic
within
call
.
<EOS>
with
this
parting
cordial
she
curtsy
off
 
you
listen
to
the
sound
of
her
recede
footstep
as
long
as
the
last
echo
can
reach
you
 
and
when
,
with
faint
spirit
,
you
attempt
to
fasten
your
door
,
you
discover
,
with
increase
alarm
,
that
it
have
no
lock
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Tilney
,
how
frightful
!
<EOS>
this
be
just
like
a
book
!
<EOS>
but
it
can
not
really
happen
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
your
housekeeper
be
not
really
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
well
,
what
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
nothing
further
to
alarm
perhaps
may
occur
the
first
night
.
<EOS>
after
surmount
your
unconquerable
horror
of
the
bed
,
you
will
retire
to
rest
,
and
get
a
few
hour
'
unquiet
slumber
.
<EOS>
but
on
the
second
,
or
at
farth
the
third
night
after
your
arrival
,
you
will
probably
have
a
violent
storm
.
<EOS>
peal
of
thunder
so
loud
as
to
seem
to
shake
the
edifice
to
its
foundation
will
roll
round
the
neighbouring
mountain
 
and
during
the
frightful
gust
of
wind
which
accompany
it
,
you
will
probably
think
you
discern
(
for
your
lamp
be
not
extinguish
)
<EOS>
one
part
of
the
hang
more
violently
agitate
than
the
rest
.
<EOS>
unable
of
course
to
repress
your
curiosity
in
so
favourable
a
moment
for
indulge
it
,
you
will
instantly
arise
,
and
throw
your
dressing
-
gown
around
you
,
proceed
to
examine
this
mystery
.
<EOS>
after
a
very
short
search
,
you
will
discover
a
division
in
the
tapestry
so
artfully
construct
as
to
defy
the
minute
inspection
,
and
on
open
it
,
a
door
will
immediately
appear
 
which
door
,
be
only
secure
by
massy
bar
and
a
padlock
,
you
will
,
after
a
few
effort
,
succeed
in
open
 
and
,
with
your
lamp
in
your
hand
,
will
pass
through
it
into
a
small
vaulted
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
,
indeed
;
I
should
be
too
much
frightened
to
do
any
such
thing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
not
when
Dorothy
have
give
you
to
understand
that
there
be
a
secret
subterraneous
communication
between
your
apartment
and
the
chapel
of
St.
Anthony
,
scarcely
two
mile
off
?
<EOS>
Could
you
shrink
from
so
simple
an
adventure
?
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
you
will
proceed
into
this
small
vaulted
room
,
and
through
this
into
several
other
,
without
perceive
anything
very
remarkable
in
either
.
<EOS>
in
one
perhaps
there
may
be
a
dagger
,
in
another
a
few
drop
of
blood
,
and
in
a
third
the
remain
of
some
instrument
of
torture
;
but
there
be
nothing
in
all
this
out
of
the
common
way
,
and
your
lamp
be
nearly
exhaust
,
you
will
return
towards
your
own
apartment
.
<EOS>
in
repasse
through
the
small
vaulted
room
,
however
,
your
eye
will
be
attract
towards
a
large
,
old
-
fashioned
cabinet
of
ebony
and
gold
,
which
,
though
narrowly
examine
the
furniture
before
,
you
have
pass
unnoticed
.
<EOS>
impel
by
an
irresistible
presentiment
,
you
will
eagerly
advance
to
it
,
unlock
its
fold
door
,
and
search
into
every
drawer
 
but
for
some
time
without
discover
anything
of
importance
 
perhaps
nothing
but
a
considerable
hoard
of
diamond
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
however
,
by
touch
a
secret
spring
,
an
inner
compartment
will
open
 
<EOS>
a
roll
of
paper
appear
 
you
seize
it
 
it
contain
many
sheet
of
manuscript
 
<EOS>
you
hasten
with
the
precious
treasure
into
your
own
chamber
,
but
scarcely
have
you
be
able
to
decipher
"
oh
!
<EOS>
Thou
 
<EOS>
whomsoever
thou
mayst
be
,
into
whose
hand
these
memoir
of
the
wretched
Matilda

fall

your
lamp
suddenly
expire
in
the
socket
,

leave
you
in
total
darkness

"
<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
no

no
 
do
not

so

<EOS>
but
Henry
be
too
much
amuse
by
the
interest
he
have
raise
to
be
able
to
carry
it
farther
;
he
could
no

command
solemnity

of

entreat

use

massy
wall
of
grey
stone

amidst
a
grove
of
ancient
oak

with
the
last
beam
of
the
sun

beautiful
splendour
on

high
gothic
window

so
low

through
the
great
gate
of
the
lodge
into
the
very
ground
of
Northanger

without

even
an
antique
chimney

<EOS>
She
know
not
that
she
have
any
right
to

surprised
,
but
there
be
a
something
in
this
mode
of
approach
which
she

<EOS>
to
pass
between

a
modern

with
such
ease

<EOS>
She

for
such
consideration

it
impossible
for
her

observe
anything
further

the

it

nothing

a

mizzling
rain

<EOS>
an

<EOS>
yes

it
be
delightful
to
be
really
in
an
abbey

<EOS>
but
she
doubt
,
as
she
look
round
the
room

whether
anything
within
her
observation
would
have
give
her
the
consciousness

<EOS>
the
furniture

in
all
the
profusion
and
elegance
of

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
they

to

<EOS>
the

how
her
eye

begin
to
talk
of
the
smallness
of
the

simplicity
of

where
everything

that
there

the
costly

short
to

within
twenty

<EOS>
this
seem
the
word
of
separation
,
and
Catherine
find
herself
hurry
away
by
Miss
Tilney
in
such
a
manner
as
convince
her
that
the
strict
punctuality
to
the
family
hour
would
be
expect
at
Northanger
.
  
<EOS>
return
through
the
large
and
lofty
hall
,
they
ascend
a
broad
staircase
of
shine
oak
,
which

after
many
flight
and
many
landing

bring
them
upon
a
long
,
wide
gallery

<EOS>
on
one
side
it

it

on
the

which
Catherine
have
only
time
to
discover
look
into
a
quadrangle
,
before
Miss
Tilney
lead
the
way
into
a
chamber
,
and
scarcely
stay
to
hope
she
would
find
it
comfortable
,
leave
her
with
an
anxious
entreaty
that
she
would
make
as
little
alteration
as
possible
in
her
dress
.
    
<EOS>
a
moment
's
glance
be
enough
to
satisfy
Catherine
that
her
apartment
be
very
unlike
the
one
which
Henry
have
endeavour
to
alarm
her
by
the
description
of
.
<EOS>
It
be
by
no
means
unreasonably
large
,
and
contain
neither
tapestry
nor
velvet
.
<EOS>
the
wall
be
paper
,
the
floor
be
carpet
;
the
window
be
neither
less
perfect
nor
more
dim
than
those
of
the
drawing
-
room
below
;
the
furniture
,
though
not
of
the
late
fashion
,
be
handsome
and
comfortable
,
and
the
air
of
the
room
altogether
far
from
uncheerful
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
instantaneously
at
ease
on
this
point
,
she
resolve
to
lose
no
time
in
particular
examination
of
anything
,
as
she
greatly
dread
disoblige
the
general
by
any
delay
.
<EOS>
Her
habit
therefore
be
throw
off
with
all
possible
haste
,
and
she
be
prepare
to
unpin
the
linen
package
,
which
the
chaise
-
seat
have
convey
for
her
immediate
accommodation
,
when
her
eye
suddenly
fall
on
a
large
high
chest
,
stand
back
in
a
deep
recess
on
one
side
of
the
fireplace
.
<EOS>
the
sight
of
it
make
her
start
;
and
,
forget
everything
else
,
she
stand
gaze
on
it
in
motionless
wonder
,
while
these
thought
cross
her
:
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
strange
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
expect
such
a
sight
as
this
!
<EOS>
an
immense
heavy
chest
!
<EOS>
what
can
it
hold
?
<EOS>
why
should
it
be
place
here
?
<EOS>
push
back
too
,
as
if
mean
to
be
out
of
sight
!
<EOS>
I
will
look
into
it
 
cost
me
what
it
may
,
I
will
look
into
it
 
and
directly
too
 
by
daylight
.
<EOS>
if
I
stay
till
evening
my
candle
may
go
out
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
advance
and
examine
it
closely
:
it
be
of
cedar
,
curiously
inlay
with
some
dark
wood
,
and
raise
,
about
a
foot
from
the
ground
,
on
a
carved
stand
of
the
same
.
<EOS>
the
lock
be
silver
,
though
tarnish
from
age
;
at
each
end
be
the
imperfect
remain
of
handle
also
of
silver
,
break
perhaps
prematurely
by
some
strange
violence
;
and
,
on
the
centre
of
the
lid
,
be
a
mysterious
cipher
,
in
the
same
metal
.
<EOS>
Catherine
bent
over
it
intently
,
but
without
be
able
to
distinguish
anything
with
certainty
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
,
in
whatever
direction
she
take
it
,
believe
the
last
letter
to
be
a
t
;
and
yet
that
it
should
be
anything
else
in
that
house
<EOS>
be
a
circumstance
to
raise
no
common
degree
of
astonishment
.
<EOS>
if
not
originally
theirs
,
by
what
strange
event
could
it
have
fall
into
the
Tilney
family
?
  
<EOS>
Her
fearful
curiosity
be
every
moment
grow
great
;
and
seize
,
with
tremble
hand
,
the
hasp
of
the
lock
,
she
resolve
at
all
hazard
to
satisfy
herself
at
least
as
to
its
content
.
<EOS>
with
difficulty
,
for
something
seem
to
resist
her
effort
,
she
raise
the
lid
a
few
inch
;
but
at
that
moment
a
sudden
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
room
make
her
,
start
,
quit
her
hold
,
and
the
lid
close
with
alarming
violence
.
<EOS>
this
ill
-
time
intruder
be
Miss
Tilney
's
maid
,
send
by
her
mistress
to
be
of
use
to
Miss
Morland
;
and
though
Catherine
immediately
dismiss
her
,
it
recall
her
to
the
sense
of
what
she
ought
to
be
do
,
and
force
her
,
in
spite
of
her
anxious
desire
to
penetrate
this
mystery
,
to
proceed
in
her
dressing
without
further
delay
.
<EOS>
Her
progress
be
not
quick
,
for
her
thought
and
her
eye
<EOS>
be
still
bent
on
the
object
so
well
calculated
to
interest
and
alarm
;
and
though
she
dare
not
waste
a
moment
upon
a
second
attempt
,
she
could
not
remain
many
pace
from
the
chest
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
have
slip
one
arm
into
her
gown
,
her
toilette
seem
so
nearly
finish
that
the
impatience
of
her
curiosity
may
safely
be
indulge
.
<EOS>
one
moment
surely
may
be
spare
;
and
,
so
desperate
should
be
the
exertion
of
her
strength
,
that
,
unless
secure
by
supernatural
mean
,
the
lid
in
one
moment
should
be
throw
back
.
<EOS>
with
this
spirit
she
spring
forward
,
and
her
confidence
do
not
deceive
her
.
<EOS>
Her
resolute
effort
throw
back
the
lid
,
and
give
to
her
astonished
eye
the
view
of
a
white
cotton
counterpane
,
properly
fold
,
repose
at
one
end
of
the
chest
in
undisputed
possession
!
  
<EOS>
She
be
gaze
on
it
with
the
first
blush
of
surprise
when
Miss
Tilney
,
anxious
for
her
friend
's
be
ready
,
enter
the
room
,
and
to
the
rise
shame
of
have
harbour
for
some
minute
an
absurd
expectation
,
be
then
add
the
shame
of
be
catch
in
so
idle
a
search
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
curious
old
chest
,
be
not
it
?
"
say
Miss
Tilney
,
as
Catherine
hastily
close
it
and
turn
away
to
the
glass
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
impossible
to
say
how
many
generation
it

here

<EOS>
how
it
come
to

put
in
this
room
<EOS>
I
know
not

<EOS>
but
I
have
not
have
it
move
,
because
I
think
it
may
sometimes
be
of
use
in
hold
hat
and
bonnet

<EOS>
the
bad
of
it
be
that
its
weight
make
it
difficult
to
open

<EOS>
in
that
corner
,
however

it

out

<EOS>
Catherine

no
leisure
for
speech
,
be
at
once
blush
,
tie
her
gown
,
and
form
wise
resolution
with
the
most
violent
dispatch
.
<EOS>
Miss
Tilney
gently
hint
her
fear
of
be
late
;
and
in
half
a
minute
they
run
downstairs
together
,
in
an
alarm
not
wholly
unfounded
,
for
General
Tilney
be
pace
the
drawing

room
,
his
watch
in
his
hand
,
and
have
,
on
the
very
instant
of
their
entering

pull
the
bell
with
violence
,
order
"
dinner
to
be
on
table
directly
!
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
tremble
at
the
emphasis
with
which
he
speak
,
and
sit
pale
and
breathless
,
in
a
most
humble
mood
,
concern
for
his
child
,
and
detest
old
chest
;
and
the
general
,
recover
his
politeness
as
he
look
at
her
,
spend
the
rest
of
his
time
in
scold
his
daughter
for
so
foolishly
hurry
her
fair
friend
,
who
be
absolutely
out
of
breath
from
haste
,
when
there
be
not
the
least
occasion
for
hurry
in
the
world
:
but
Catherine
could
not
at
all
get
over
the
double
distress
of
have
involve
her
friend
in
a
lecture
and
be
a
great
simpleton
herself
,
till
they
be
happily
seat
at
the
dinner
-
table
,
when
the
general
's
complacent
smile
,
and
a
good
appetite
of
her
own
,
restore
her
to
peace
.
<EOS>
the
dining
-
parlour
be
a
noble
room
,
suitable
in
its
dimension
to
a
much
large
drawing
-
room
than
the
one
in
common
use
,
and
fit
up
in
a
style
of
luxury
and
expense
which
be
almost
lose
on
the
unpractised
eye
of
Catherine
,
who
see
little
more
than
its
spaciousness
and
the
number
of
their
attendant
.
<EOS>
of
the
former
,
she
speak
aloud
her
admiration
;
and
the
general
,
with
a
very
gracious
countenance
,
acknowledge
that
it
be
by
no
mean
an
ill
-
sized
room
,
and
further
confess
that
,
though
as
careless
on
such
subject
as
most
people
,
he
do
look
upon
a
tolerably
large
eating
-
room
as
one
of
the
necessary
of
life
;
he
suppose
,
however
,
"
that
she
must
have
be
use
to
much
well
-
sized
apartment
at
Mr.
Allen
's
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
,
"
be
Catherine
's
honest
assurance
;
"
Mr.
Allen
's
dining
-
parlour
be
not
more
than
half
as
large
,
"
and
she
have
never
see
so
large
a
room
as
this
in
her
life
.
<EOS>
the
general
's
good
humour
increase
.
<EOS>
why
,
as
he
have
such
room
,
he
think
it
would
be
simple
not
to
make
use
of
them
;
but
,
upon
his
honour
,
he
believe
there
may
be
more
comfort
in
room
of
only
half
their
size
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Allen
's
house
,
he
be
sure
,
must
be
exactly
of
the
true
size
for
rational
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
the
evening
pass
without
any
further
disturbance
,
and
,
in
the
occasional
absence
of
General
Tilney
,
with
much
positive
cheerfulness
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
in
his
presence
that
Catherine
feel
the
small
fatigue
from
her
journey
;
and
even
then
,
even
in
moment
of
languor
or
restraint
,
a
sense
of
general
happiness
preponderate
,
and
she
could
think
of
her
friend
in
Bath
without
one
wish
of
be
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
night
be
stormy
;
the
wind
have
be
rise
at
interval
the
whole
afternoon
;
and
by
the
time
the
party
break
up
,
it
blow
and
rain
violently
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
as
she
cross
the
hall
,
listen
to
the
temp
with
sensation
of
awe
;
and
,
when
she
hear
it
rage
round
a
corner
of
the
ancient
building
and
close
with
sudden
fury
a
distant
door
,
feel
for
the
first
time
that
she
be
really
in
an
abbey
.
<EOS>
yes
,
these
be
characteristic
sound
;
they
bring
to
her
recollection
a
countless
variety
of
dreadful
situation
and
horrid
scene
,
which
such
building
have
witness
,
and
such
storm
usher
in
;
and
most
heartily
do
she
rejoice
in
the
happy
circumstance
attend
her
entrance
within
wall
<EOS>
so
solemn
!
<EOS>
She
have
nothing
to
dread
from
midnight
assassin
or
drunken
gallant
.
<EOS>
Henry
have
certainly
be
only
in
jest
in
what
he
have
tell
her
that
morning
.
<EOS>
in
a
house
so
furnished
,
and
so
guard
,
she
could
have
nothing
to
explore
or
to
suffer
,
and
may
go
to
her
bedroom
as
securely
as
if
it
have
be
her
own
chamber
at
Fullerton
.
<EOS>
thus
wisely
fortify
her
mind
,
as
she
proceed
upstairs
,
she
be
enable
,
especially
on
perceive
that
Miss
Tilney
sleep
only
two
door
from
her

to
enter
her
room
with
a
tolerably
stout
heart
;
and
her
spirit
be
immediately
assist
by
the
cheerful
blaze
of
a
wood
fire
.
<EOS>
"
how
much
well
be
this
,
"
say
she
,
as
she
walk
to
the
fender
 
<EOS>
"
how
much
well
to
find
a
fire
ready
lit
,
than
to
have
to
wait
shiver
in
the
cold
till
all
the
family
be
in
bed
,
as
so
many
poor
girl
have
be
oblige
to
do
,
and
then
to
have
a
faithful
old
servant
frightening
one
by
come
in
with
a
faggot
!
<EOS>
how
glad
I
be
that
Northanger
be
what
it
be
!
<EOS>
if
it
have
be
like
some
other
place
,
I
do
not
know
that
,
in
such
a
night
as
this
,
I
could
have
answer
for
my
courage
:
but
now
,
to
be
sure
,
there
be
nothing
to
alarm
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
look
round
the
room
.
<EOS>
the
window
curtain
seem
in
motion
.
<EOS>
It
could
be
nothing
but
the
violence
of
the
wind
penetrate
through
the
division
of
the
shutter
;
and
she
step
boldly
forward
,
carelessly
hum
a
tune
,
to
assure
herself
of
its
be
so
,
peep
courageously
behind
each
curtain
,
see
nothing
on
either
low
window
seat
to
scare
her
,
and
on
place
a
hand
against
the
shutter
,
feel
the
strong
conviction
of
the
wind
's
force
.
<EOS>
a
glance
at
the
old
chest
,
as
she
turn
away
from
this
examination
,
be
not
without
its
use
;
she
scorn
the
causeless
fear
of
an
idle
fancy
,
and
begin
with
a
most
happy
indifference
to
prepare
herself
for
bed
.
<EOS>
"
She
should
take
her
time
;
she
should
not
hurry
herself
;
she
do
not
care
if
she
be
the
last
person
up
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
but
she
would
not
make
up
her
fire
;
that
would
seem
cowardly
,
as
if
she
wish
for
the
protection
of
light
after
she
be
in
bed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
fire
therefore
die
away
,
and
Catherine
,
have
spend
the
good
part
of
an
hour
in
her
arrangement
,
be
begin
to
think
of
step
into
bed
,
when
,
on
give
a
part
glance
round
the
room
,
she
be
strike
by
the
appearance
of
a
high
,
old
-
fashioned
black
cabinet
,
which
,
though
in
a
situation
conspicuous
enough
,
have
never
catch
her
notice
before
.
<EOS>
Henry
's
word
,
his
description
of
the
ebony
cabinet
which
be
to
escape
her
observation
at
first
,
immediately
rush
across
her
;
and
though
there
could
be
nothing
really
in
it
,
there
be
something
whimsical
,
it
be
certainly
a
very
remarkable
coincidence
!
<EOS>
She
take
her
candle
and
look
closely
at
the
cabinet
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
absolutely
ebony
and
gold
;
but
it
be
japan
,
black
and
yellow
japan
of
the
handsome
kind
;
and
as
she
hold
her
candle
,
the
yellow
have
very
much
the
effect
of
gold
.
<EOS>
the
key
be
in
the
door
,
and
she
have
a
strange
fancy
to
look
into
it
;
not
,
however
,
with
the
small
expectation
of
find
anything
,
but
it
be
so
very
odd
,
after
what
Henry
have
say
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
she
could
not
sleep
till
she
have
examine
it
.
<EOS>
so
,
place
the
candle
with
great
caution
on
a
chair
,
she
seize
the
key
with
a
very
tremulous
hand
and
try
to
turn
it
;
but
it
resist
her
utmost
strength
.
<EOS>
alarm
,
but
not
discourage
,
she
try
it
another
way
;
a
bolt
fly
,
and
she
believe
herself
successful
;
but
how
strangely
mysterious
!
<EOS>
the
door
be
still
immovable
.
<EOS>
She
pause
a
moment
in
breathless
wonder
.
<EOS>
the
wind
roar
down
the
chimney
,
the
rain
beat
in
torrent
against
the
window
,
and
everything
seem
to
speak
the
awfulness
of
her
situation
.
<EOS>
to
retire
to
bed
,
however
,
unsatisfied
on
such
a
point
,
would
be
vain
,
since
sleep
must
be
impossible
with
the
consciousness
of
a
cabinet
so
mysteriously
closed
in
her
immediate
vicinity
.
<EOS>
again
,
therefore
,
she
apply
herself
to
the
key
,
and
after
move
it
in
every
possible
way
for
some
instant
with
the
determined
celerity
of
hope
's
last
effort
,
the
door
suddenly
yield
to
her
hand
:
her
heart
leap
with
exultation
at
such
a
victory
,
and
have
throw
open
each
fold
door
,
the
second
being
secure
only
by
bolt
of
less
wonderful
construction
than
the
lock
,
though
in
that
her
eye
could
not
discern
anything
unusual
,
a
double
range
of
small
drawer
appear
in
view
,
with
some
large
drawer
above
and
below
them
;
and
in
the
centre
,
a
small
door
,
close
also
with
a
lock
and
key
,
secure
in
all
probability
a
cavity
of
importance
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
's
heart
beat
quick
,
but
her
courage
do
not
fail
her
.
<EOS>
with
a
cheek
flush
by
hope
,
and
an
eye
strain
with
curiosity
,
her
finger
grasp
the
handle
of
a
drawer
and
draw
it
forth
.
<EOS>
It
be
entirely
empty
.
<EOS>
with
less
alarm
and
great
eagerness
she
seize
a
second
,
a
third
,
a
fourth
;
each
be
equally
empty
.
<EOS>
not
one
be
leave
unsearched
,
and
in
not
one
be
anything
find
.
<EOS>
well
read
in
the
art
of
conceal
a
treasure
,
the
possibility
of
false
lining
to
the
drawer
do
not
escape
her
,
and
she
feel
round
each
with
anxious
acuteness
in
vain
.
<EOS>
the
place
in
the
middle
alone
remain
now
unexplored
;
and
though
she
have
"
never
from
the
first
have
the
small
idea
of
find
anything
in
any
part
of
the
cabinet
,
and
be
not
in
the
least
disappointed
at
her
ill
success
thus
far
,
it
would
be
foolish
not
to
examine
it
thoroughly
while
she
be
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
some
time
however
before
she
could
unfasten
the
door
,
the
same
difficulty
occur
in
the
management
of
this
inner
lock
as
of
the
outer
;
but
at
length
it
do
open
;
and
not
vain
,
as
hitherto
,
be
her
search
;
her
quick
eye
directly
fall
on
a
roll
of
paper
push
back
into
the
further
part
of
the
cavity
,
apparently
for
concealment
,
and
her
feeling
at
that
moment
be
indescribable
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
flutter
,
her
knee
tremble
,
and
her
cheek
grow
pale
.
<EOS>
She
seize
,
with
an
unsteady
hand
,
the
precious
manuscript
,
for
half
a
glance
suffice
to
ascertain
write
character
;
and
while
she
acknowledge
with
awful
sensation
this
striking
exemplification
of
what
Henry
have
foretold
,
resolve
instantly
to
peruse
every
line
before
she
attempt
to
rest
.
  
<EOS>
the
dimness
of
the
light
her
candle
emit
make
her
turn
to
it
with
alarm
;
but
there
be
no
danger
of
its
sudden
extinction
;
it
have
yet
some
hour
to
burn
;
and
that
she
may
not
have
any
great
difficulty
in
distinguish
the
writing
than
what
its
ancient
date
may
occasion
<EOS>
,
she
hastily
snuff
it
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
It
be
snuff
and
extinguish
in
one
.
<EOS>
a
lamp
could
not
have
expire
with
more
awful
effect
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
for
a
few
moment
,
be
motionless
with
horror
.
<EOS>
It
be
do
completely
;
not
a
remnant
of
light
in
the
wick
could
give
hope
to
the
rekindle
breath
.
<EOS>
darkness
impenetrable
and
immovable
fill
the
room
.
<EOS>
a
violent
gust
of
wind
,
rise
with
sudden
fury
,
add
fresh
horror
to
the
moment
.
<EOS>
Catherine
tremble
from
head
to
foot
.
<EOS>
in
the
pause
which
succeed
,
a
sound
like
recede
footstep
and
the
closing
of
a
distant
door
strike
on
her
affright
ear
.
<EOS>
human
nature
could
support
no
more
.
<EOS>
a
cold
sweat
stand
on
her
forehead
,
the
manuscript
fall
from
her
hand
,
and
grope
her
way
to
the
bed
,
she
jump
hastily
in
,
and
seek
some
suspension
of
agony
by
creep
far
underneath
the
clothe
.
<EOS>
to
close
her
eye
in
sleep
that
night
,
she
feel
must
be
entirely
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
with
a
curiosity
so
justly
awaken
,
and
feeling
in
every
way
<EOS>
so
agitated
,
repose
must
be
absolutely
impossible
.
<EOS>
the
storm
too
abroad
so
dreadful
!
<EOS>
She
have
not
be
use
to
feel
alarm
from
wind
,
but
now
every
blast
seem
fraught
with
awful
intelligence
.
<EOS>
the
manuscript
so
wonderfully
find
,
so
wonderfully
accomplish
the
morning
's
prediction
,
how
be
it
to
be
account
for
?
<EOS>
what
could
it
contain
?
<EOS>
to
whom
could
it
relate
?
<EOS>
by
what
mean
could
it
have
be
so
long
conceal
?
<EOS>
and
how
singularly
strange
that
it
should
fall
to
her
lot
to
discover
it
!
<EOS>
till
she
have
make
herself
mistress
of
its
content
,
however
,
she
could
have
neither
repose
nor
comfort
;
and
with
the
sun
's
first
ray
she
be
determined
to
peruse
it
.
<EOS>
but
many
be
the
tedious
hour
which
must
yet
intervene
.
<EOS>
She
shudder
,
toss
about
in
her
bed
,
and
envy
every
quiet
sleeper
.
<EOS>
the
storm
still
rage
,
and
various
be
the
noise
,
more
terrific
even
than
the
wind
,
which
strike
at
interval
on
her
startled
ear
.
<EOS>
the
very
curtain
of
her
bed
seem
at
one
moment
in
motion
,
and
at
another
the
lock
of
her
door
be
agitate
,
as
if
by
the
attempt
of
somebody
to
enter
.
<EOS>
hollow
murmur
seem
to
creep
along
the
gallery
,
and
more
than
once
her
blood
be
chill
by
the
sound
of
distant
moan
.
<EOS>
hour
after
hour
pass
away
,
and
the
weary
Catherine
have
hear
three
proclaim
by
all
the
clock
in
the
house
before
the
temp
subside
or
she
unknowingly
fall
fast
asleep
.
    
<EOS>
the
housemaid
's
fold
back
her
window
-
shutter
at
eight
o'clock
the
next
day
be
the
sound
which
first
rouse
Catherine
;
and
she
open
her
eye
,
wonder
that
they
could
ever
have
be
close
,
on
object
of
cheerfulness
;
her
fire
be
already
burn
,
and
a
bright
morning
have
succeed
the
temp
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
instantaneously
,
with
the
consciousness
of
existence
,
return
her
recollection
of
the
manuscript
;
and
spring
from
the
bed
in
the
very
moment
of
the
maid
's
go
away
,
she
eagerly
collect
every
scattered
sheet
which
have
burst
from
the
roll
on
its
falling
to
the
ground
,
and
fly
back
to
enjoy
the
luxury
of
their
perusal
on
her
pillow
.
<EOS>
She
now
plainly
see
that
she
must
not
expect
a
manuscript
of
equal
length
with
the
generality
of
what
she
have
shudder
over
in
book
,
for
the
roll
,
seem
to
consist
entirely
of
small
disjoint
sheet
,
be
altogether
but
of
trifling
size
,
and
much
less
than
she
have
suppose
it
to
be
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
Her
greedy
eye
glance
rapidly
over
a
page
.
<EOS>
She
start
at
its
import
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
possible
,
or
do
not
her
sense
play
her
false
?
<EOS>
an
inventory
of
linen
,
in
coarse
and
modern
character
,
seem
all
that
be
before
her
!
<EOS>
if
the
evidence
of
sight
may
be
trust
,
she
hold
a
washing
-
bill
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
seize
another
sheet
,
and
see
the
same
article
with
little
variation
;
a
third
,
a
fourth
,
and
a
fifth
present
nothing
new
.
<EOS>
shirt
,
stocking
,
cravat
,
and
waistcoat
face
her
in
each
.
<EOS>
two
other
,
pen
by
the
same
hand
,
mark
an
expenditure
scarcely
more
interesting
,
in
letter
,
hair
-
powder
,
shoe
-
string
,
and
breech
-
ball
.
<EOS>
and
the
large
sheet
,
which
have
enclose
the
rest
,
seem
by
its
first
cramp
line
,
"
to
poultice
chestnut
mare
"
 
a
farri
's
bill
!
<EOS>
such
be
the
collection
of
paper
(
leave
perhaps
,
as
she
could
then
suppose
,
by
the
negligence
of
a
servant
in
the
place
<EOS>
whence
she
have
take
them
)
which
have
fill
her
with
expectation
and
alarm
,
and
rob
her
of
half
her
night
's
rest
!
<EOS>
She
feel
humble
to
the
dust
.
<EOS>
Could
not
the
adventure
of
the
chest
have
teach
her
wisdom
?
<EOS>
a
corner
of
it
,
catch
her
eye
as
she
lie
,
seem
to
rise
up
in
judgment
against
her
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
now
be
clear
than
the
absurdity
of
her
recent
fancy
.
<EOS>
to
suppose
that
a
manuscript
of
many
generation
back
could
have
remain
undiscovered
in
a
room
such
as
that
,
so
modern
,
so
habitable
!
 
<EOS>
or
that
she
should
be
the
first
to
possess
the
skill
of
unlock
a
cabinet
,
the
key
of
which
be
open
to
all
!
  
<EOS>
how
could
she
have
so
imposed
on
herself
?
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
that
Henry
Tilney
should
ever
know
her
folly
!
<EOS>
and
it
be
in
a
great
measure
<EOS>
his
own
doing
,
for
have
not
the
cabinet
appear
so
exactly
to
agree
with
his
description
of
her
adventure
,
she
should
never
have
feel
the
small
curiosity
about
it
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
only
comfort
that
occur
.
<EOS>
impatient
to
get
rid
of
those
hateful
evidence
of
her
folly
,
those
detestable
paper
then
scatter
over
the
bed
,
she
rise
directly
,
and
fold
them
up
as
nearly
as
possible
in
the
same
shape
as
before
,
return
them
to
the
same
spot
within
the
cabinet
,
with
a
very
hearty
wish
that
no
untoward
accident
may
ever
bring
them
forward
again
,
to
disgrace
her
even
with
herself
.
  
<EOS>
why
the
lock
should
have
be
so
difficult
to
open
,
however
,
be
still
something
remarkable
,
for
she
could
now
manage
them
with
perfect
ease
.
<EOS>
in
this
there
be
surely
something
mysterious
,
and
she
indulge
in
the
flattering
suggestion
for
half
a
minute
,
till
the
possibility
of
the
door
's
have
be
at
first
unlocked
,
and
of
be
herself
its
fastener
,
dart
into
her
head
,
and
cost
her
another
blush
.
  
<EOS>
She
get
away
as
soon
as
she
could
from
a
room
in
which
her
conduct
produce
such
unpleasant
reflection
,
and
find
her
way
with
all
speed
to
the
breakfast
-
parlour
,
as
it
have
be
point
out
to
her
by
Miss
Tilney
the
evening
before
.
<EOS>
Henry
be
alone
in
it
;
and
his
immediate
hope
of
her
have
be
undisturbed
by
the
temp
,
with
an
arch
reference
to
the
character
of
the
building
they
inhabit
,
be
rather
distress
.
<EOS>
for
the
world
would
she
not
have
her
weakness
suspect
,
and
yet
,
unequal
to
an
absolute
falsehood
,
be
constrain
to
acknowledge
that
the
wind
have
keep
her
awake
a
little
.
"
<EOS>
but
we
have
a
charming
morning
after
it
,
"
she
add
,
desire
to
get
rid
of
the
subject

beautiful
hyacinth
!
<EOS>
I
have
just
learn
to
love
a
hyacinth

how
may
you
learn
?

by
accident

argument

Your

teach
me
;
I
can
not
tell
how

<EOS>
Mrs.
Allen
use
to
take
pain
,
year
after
year
,
to
make
me
like
them
;
but
I
never
could
,
till
I
see
them
the
other
day
in
Milsom
Street
;
I
be
naturally
indifferent
about
flower
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
now
you
love
a
hyacinth
.
<EOS>
so
much
the
well
.
<EOS>
You
have
gain
a
new
source
of
enjoyment
,
and
it
be
well
to
have
as
many
hold
upon
happiness
as
possible
.
<EOS>
besides
,
a
taste
for
flower
be
always
desirable
in
your
sex
,
as
a
means
of
get
you
out
of
door
,
and
tempt
you
to
more
frequent
exercise
than
you
would
otherwise
take
.
<EOS>
and
though
the
love
of
a
hyacinth
may
be
rather
domestic
,
who
can
tell
,
the
sentiment
once
raise
,
but
you
may
in
time
come
to
love
a
rose
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
want
any
such
pursuit
to
get
me
out
of
door
.
<EOS>
the
pleasure
of
walk
and
breathe
fresh
air
be
enough
for
me
,
and
in
fine
weather
I
be
out
more
than
half
my
time
.
<EOS>
Mamma
say
I
be
never
within
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
at
any
rate
,
however
,
I
be
pleased
that
you
have
learn
to
love
a
hyacinth
.
<EOS>
the
mere
habit
of
learn
to
love
be
the
thing
;
and
a
teachableness
of
disposition
in
a
young
lady
be
a
great
blessing
.
<EOS>
have
my
sister
a
pleasant
mode
of
instruction
?
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
be
save
the
embarrassment
of
attempt
an
answer
by
the
entrance
of
the
general
,
whose
smile
compliment
announce
a
happy
state
of
mind
,
but
whose
gentle
hint
of
sympathetic
early
rise
do
not
advance
her
composure
.
  
<EOS>
the
elegance
of
the
breakfast
set
force
itself
on
Catherine
's
notice
when
they
be
seat
at
table
;
and
,
lucidly
,
it
have
be
the
general
's
choice
.
<EOS>
He
be
enchant
by
her
approbation
of
his
taste
,
confess
it
to
be
neat
and
simple
,
think
it
right
to
encourage
the
manufacture
of
his
country
;
and
for
his
part
,
to
his
uncritical
palate
,
the
tea
be
as
well
flavour
from
the
clay
of
Staffordshire
,
as
from
that
of
Dresden
or
Save
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
quite
an
old
set
,
purchase
two
year
ago
.
<EOS>
the
manufacture
be
much
improve
since
that
time
;
he
have
see
some
beautiful
specimen
when
last
in
town
,
and
have
he
not
be
perfectly
without
vanity
of
that
kind
,
may
have
be
tempt
to
order
a
new
set
.
<EOS>
He
trust
,
however
,
that
an
opportunity
may
ere
long
occur
of
select
one
 
though
not
for
himself
.
<EOS>
Catherine
be
probably
the
only
one
of
the
party
who
do
not
understand
him
.
  
<EOS>
shortly
after
breakfast
Henry
leave
them
for
Woodston
,
where
business
require
and
would
keep
him
two
or
three
day
.
<EOS>
They
all
attend
in
the
hall
to
see
him
mount
his
horse
,
and
immediately
on
re
-
enter
the
breakfast
-
room
,
Catherine
walk
to
a
window
in
the
hope
of
catch
another
glimpse
of
his
figure
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
somewhat
heavy
call
upon
your
brother
's
fortitude
,
"
observe
the
general
to
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
Woodston
will
make
but
a
sombre
appearance
today
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
a
pretty
place
?
"
ask
Catherine
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
say
you
,
Eleanor
?
<EOS>
speak
your
opinion
,
for
lady
can
best
tell
the
taste
of
lady
in
regard
to
place
as
well
as
man
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
be
acknowledge
by
the
most
impartial
eye
to
have
many
recommendation
.
<EOS>
the
house
stand
among
fine
meadow
face
the
south
-
east
,
with
an
excellent
kitchen
-
garden
in
the
same
aspect
;
the
wall
surround
which
I
build
and
stock
myself
about
ten
year
ago
,
for
the
benefit
of
my
son
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
family
live
,
Miss
Morland
;
and
the
property
in
the
place
be
chiefly
my
own
,
you
may
believe
I
take
care
that
it
shall
not
be
a
bad
one
.
<EOS>
do
Henry
's
income
depend
solely
on
this
living
,
he
would
not
be
ill
-
provide
for
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
may
seem
odd
,
that
with
only
two
young
child
,
I
should
think
any
profession
necessary
for
him
;
and
certainly
there
be
moment
when
we
could
all
wish
him
disengage
from
every
tie
of
business
.
<EOS>
but
though
I
may
not
exactly
make
convert
of
you
young
lady
,
I
be
sure
your
father
,
Miss
Morland
,
would
agree
with
me
in
think
it
expedient
to
give
every
young
man
some
employment
.
<EOS>
the
money
be
nothing
,
it
be
not
an
object
,
but
employment
be
the
thing
.
<EOS>
even
Frederick
,
my
eld
son
,
you
see
,
who
will
perhaps
inherit
as
considerable
a
landed
property
as
any
private
man
in
the
county
,
have
his
profession
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
impose
effect
of
this
last
argument
be
equal
to
his
wish
.
<EOS>
the
silence
of
the
lady
prove
it
to
be
unanswerable
.
  
<EOS>
something
have
be
say
the
evening
before
of
her
be
show
over
the
house
,
and
he
now
offer
himself
as
her
conductor
;
and
though
Catherine
have
hope
to
explore
it
accompany
only
by
his
daughter
,
it
be
a
proposal
of
too
much
happiness
in
itself
,
under
any
circumstance
,
not
to
be
gladly
accept
;
for
she
have
be
already
eighteen
hour
in
the
abbey
,
and
have
see
only
a
few
of
its
room
.
<EOS>
the
netting
-
box
,
just
leisurely
draw
forth
,
be
close
with
joyful
haste
,
and
she
be
ready
to
attend
him
in
a
moment
.
"
<EOS>
and
when
they
have
go
over
the
house
,
he
promise
himself
moreover
the
pleasure
of
accompany
her
into
the
shrubbery
and
garden
.
"
<EOS>
She
curtsy
her
acquiescence
.
"
<EOS>
but
perhaps
it
may
be
more
agreeable
to
her
to
make
those
her
first
object
.
<EOS>
the
weather
be
at
present
favourable
,
and
at
this
time
of
year
the
uncertainty
be
very
great
of
its
continue
so
.
<EOS>
which
would
she
prefer
?
<EOS>
He
be
equally
at
her
service
.
<EOS>
which
do
his
daughter
think
would
most
accord
with
her
fair
friend
's
wish
?
<EOS>
but
he
think
he
could
discern
.
<EOS>
yes
,
he
certainly
read
in
Miss
Morland
's
eye
a
judicious
desire
of
make
use
of
the
present
smile
weather
.
<EOS>
but
when
do
she
judge
amiss
?
<EOS>
the
abbey
would
be
always
safe
and
dry
.
<EOS>
He
yield
implicitly
,
and
would
fetch
his
hat
and
attend
them
in
a
moment
.
"
<EOS>
He
leave
the
room
,
and
Catherine
,
with
a
disappointed
,
anxious
face
,
begin
to
speak
of
her
unwillingness
that
he
should
be
take
them
out
of
door
against
his
own
inclination
,
under
a
mistaken
idea
of
please
her
;
but
she
be
stop
by
Miss
Tilney
's
saying
,
with
a
little
confusion
,
"
I
believe
it
will
be
wisest
to
take
the
morning
while
it
be
so
fine
;
and
do
not
be
uneasy
on
my
father
's
account
;
he
always
walk
out
at
this
time
of
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
do
not
exactly
know
how
this
be
to
be
understand
.
<EOS>
why
be
Miss
Tilney
embarrass
?
<EOS>
Could
there
be
any
unwillingness
on
the
general
's
side
to
show
her
over
the
abbey
?
<EOS>
the
proposal
be
his
own
.
<EOS>
and
be
not
it
odd
that
he
should
always
take
his
walk
so
early
?
<EOS>
neither
her
father
nor
Mr.
Allen
do
so
.
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
very
provoking
.
<EOS>
She
be
all
impatience
to
see
the
house
,
and
have
scarcely
any
curiosity
about
the
ground
.
<EOS>
if
Henry
have
be
with
them
indeed
!
<EOS>
but
now
she
should
not
know
what
be
picturesque
when
she
see
it
.
<EOS>
such
be
her
thought
,
but
she
keep
them
to
herself
,
and
put
on
her
bonnet
in
patient
discontent
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
strike
,
however
,
beyond
her
expectation
,
by
the
grandeur
of
the
abbey
,
as
she
see
it
for
the
first
time
from
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
the
whole
building
enclose
a
large
court
;
and
two
side
of
the
quadrangle
,
rich
in
gothic
ornament
,
stand
forward
for
admiration
.
<EOS>
the
remainder
be
shut
off
by
knoll
of
old
tree
,
or
luxuriant
plantation
,
and
the
steep
woody
hill
rise
behind
,
to
give
it
shelter
,
be
beautiful
even
in
the
leafless
month
of
March
.
<EOS>
Catherine
have
see
nothing
to
compare
with
it
;
and
her
feeling
of
delight
be
so
strong
,
that
without
wait
for
any
well
authority
,
she
boldly
burst
forth
in
wonder
and
praise
.
<EOS>
the
general
listen
with
assent
gratitude
;
and
it
seem
as
if
his
own
estimation
of
Northanger
have
wait
unfixed
till
that
hour
.
  
<EOS>
the
kitchen
-
garden
be
to
be
next
admire
,
and
he
lead
the
way
to
it
across
a
small
portion
of
the
park
.
  
<EOS>
the
number
of
acre
contain
in
this
garden
be
such
as
Catherine
could
not
listen
to
without
dismay
,
be
more
than
double
the
extent
of
all
Mr.
Allen
's
,
as
well
as
her
father
's
,
include
church
-
yard
and
orchard
.
<EOS>
the
wall
seem
countless
in
number
,
endless
in
length
;
a
village
of
hot
-
house
seem
to
arise
among
them
,
and
a
whole
parish
to
be
at
work
within
the
enclosure
.
<EOS>
the
general
be
flatter
by
her
look
of
surprise
,
which
tell
him
almost
as
plainly
,
as
he
soon
force
her
to
tell
him
in
word
,
that
she
have
never
see
any
garden
at
all
equal
to
them
before
;
and
he
then
modestly
own
that
,
"
without
any
ambition
of
that
sort
himself
 
without
any
solicitude
about
it
 
<EOS>
he
do
believe
them
to
be
unrivalle
in
the
kingdom

<EOS>
if
he
have
a
hobby
-
horse
,
it
be
that

<EOS>
He
love
a
garden

<EOS>
though
careless
enough
in
most
matter
of
eat
,
he
love
good
fruit
 
<EOS>
or
if
he
do
not
,
his
friend

child
do

<EOS>
there
be
great
vexation

however
,
attend
such
a
garden
as
his

the
utmost
care
could
not

secure
the
most
valuable
fruit

he
never

express
his

why
do
you
choose
that
cold

damp
path
to
it

Miss

will
get
wet

Our
good
way
be
across

Miss
Tilney

that
I
always
think
it
the
good
and
near
way

but
perhaps
it
may
be
damp

<EOS>
It
be
a
narrow
winding
path
through
a
thick
grove
of
old
Scotch
fir
;
and
Catherine
,
strike
by
its
gloomy
aspect
,
and
eager
to
enter
it

could
not

even
by
the
general

disapprobation

be

from

forward

<EOS>
He
perceive
her
inclination
,
and
have
again
urge
the
plea
of
health
in
vain
,
be
too
polite
to
make
further
opposition
.
<EOS>
He
excuse
himself
,
however
,
from
attend
them
:
"
the
ray
of
the
sun
be
not

cheerful
for
him

he
would
meet
them
by
another
course

He
turn
away
;
and
Catherine
be
shocked
to
find
how
much
her
spirit
be
relieve
by
the
separation
.
<EOS>
the
shock
,
however
,
be
less
real
than
the
relief
,
offer
it
no
injury
;
and
she
begin
to
talk
with
easy
gaiety
of
the
delightful
melancholy
which
such
a
grove
inspire
.

"
I
be
particularly
fond

this
spot

never

interest
excite
by

with
great

why

she

partial

<EOS>
be
it
from
dejection

<EOS>
"
 
be
question
now
eagerly
pour
forth
;
the
first
three
receive
a
ready
affirmative
,
the
two
other
be
pass
by
;
and
Catherine
's
interest
in
the
deceased
Mrs.
Tilney
augment
with
every
question
,
whether
answer
or
not
.
<EOS>
of
her
unhappiness
in
marriage
,
she
feel
persuaded
.
<EOS>
the
general
certainly
have
be
an
unkind
husband
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
love
her
walk
:
could
he
therefore
have
love
her
?
<EOS>
and
besides
,
handsome
as
he
be
,
there
be
a
something
in
the
turn
of
his
feature
which
speak
his
not

behave
well
to
her

<EOS>
"
Her
picture

I
suppose
,

blush
at
the
consummate

of
her
own
question

<EOS>

no

my

dissatisfy
with
the

for
some
time
it

no
place

<EOS>
soon
after
her
death
I
obtain
it
for
my
own
,
and
hang
it
in
my
bed
-
chamber
 
where
I
shall
be
happy
to
show
it
you
;
it
be
very
like
.
"
<EOS>
here
be
another
proof
.
<EOS>
a
portrait
 
very
like
 
of
a
depart
wife
,
not
value
by
the
husband
!
<EOS>
He
must
have
be
dreadfully
cruel
to
her
!
  
<EOS>
Catherine
attempt
no
longer
to
hide
from
herself
the
nature
of
the
feeling
which
,
in
spite
of
all
his
attention

he
have
previously
excite
;
and
what
have
be
terror
and
dislike
before
,
be
now
absolute
aversion
.
<EOS>
yes
,
aversion
!
<EOS>
His
cruelty
to
such
a
charming
woman
make
him
odious
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
often
read
of
such
character
,
character
which
Mr.
Allen
have
be
use
to
call
unnatural
and
overdrawn
;
but
here
be
proof
positive
of
the
contrary
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
just
settle
this
point
when
the
end
of
the
path
bring
them
directly
upon
the
general
;
and
in
spite
of
all
her
virtuous
indignation
,
she
find
herself
again
oblige
to
walk
with
him
,
listen
to
him
,
and
even
to
smile
when
he
smile
.
<EOS>
be
no
longer
able
,
however
,
to
receive
pleasure
from
the
surround
object
,
she
soon
begin
to
walk
with
lassitude
;
the
general
perceive
it
,
and
with
a
concern
for
her
health
,
which
seem
to
reproach
her
for
her
opinion
of
him
,
be
most
urgent
for
return
with
his
daughter
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
would
follow
them
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
<EOS>
again
they
part
 
but
Eleanor
be
call
back
in
half
a
minute
to
receive
a
strict
charge
against
take
her
friend
<EOS>
round
the
abbey
till
his
return
.
<EOS>
this
second
instance
of
his
anxiety
to
delay
what
she
so
much
wish
for
strike
Catherine
as
very
remarkable
.
    
<EOS>
an
hour
pass
away
before
the
general
come
in
,
spend
,
on
the
part
of
his
young
guest
,
in
no
very
favourable
consideration
of
his
character
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
lengthen
absence
,
these
solitary
ramble
,
do
not
speak
a
mind
at
ease
,
or
a
conscience
void
of
reproach
.
<EOS>
"
at
length
he
appear
;
and
,
whatever
may
have
be
the
gloom
of
his
meditation
,
he
could
still
smile
with
them
.
<EOS>
Miss
Tilney
,
understand
in
part
her
friend
's
curiosity
to
see
the
house

soon
revive
the
subject
;

her
father
be
,
contrary
to
Catherine
's
expectation
,
unprovided
with
any
pretence
for
further
delay

beyond
that
of
stop
five

refreshment
to
be
in

room
by
their
return

at

ready
to

They
set
forward

,
with
a
grandeur
of

,
a
dignified
step
,
which
catch
the
eye

could
not

the
doubt
of
the

Catherine

he
lead
the
way
across
the
hall
,
through
the
common
drawing

room
and
one
useless
antechamber
,
into
a
room
magnificent
both
in
size
and
furniture
 
<EOS>
the
real

room
,
use
only
with
company
of
consequence

<EOS>
It

very
noble
 
<EOS>
very
grand
 
<EOS>
very
charming

<EOS>
be
all
that
Catherine
have
to
say
,
for
her
indiscriminate
eye
scarcely
discern
the
colour
of
the
satin
;
and
all
minuteness
of
praise
,
all
praise
that
have
much
meaning
,
be
supply
by
the
general
:
the
costliness
or
elegance
of
any
room
's
fitting
-
up
could
be
nothing
to
her
;
she
care
for
no
furniture
of
a
more
modern
date
than
the
fifteenth
century
.
<EOS>
when
the
general
have
satisfy
his
own
curiosity
,
in
a
close
examination
of
every
well

they
proceed
into
the
library

an
apartment

its
way

of
equal
magnificence

exhibit
a
collection
of
book

on
which
an
humble
man
may
have
look
with
pride
.
<EOS>
Catherine
hear
,
admire
,
and
wonder
with
more
genuine
feeling
than
before
 
gather
all
that
she
could
from
this
storehouse
of
knowledge
,
by
run
over
the
title
of
half
a
shelf
,
and
be
ready
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
but
suite
of
apartment
do
not
spring
up
with
her
wish

<EOS>
large
as
be
the
building

she
have
already

the
great

;
though

the
suspicion

It
be
some
relief

that

through
a

o'clock

the

for
the
more
certain
information
of
Miss
Morland

as
to
what
she

they
proceed
by
quick
communication
to
the
kitchen
 
<EOS>
the
ancient
kitchen
of
the
convent

rich
in
the
massy
wall
and
smoke
of
former

their
spacious
theatre
;
and

when
the
genius
of
other
have
fail
,
his
own
have
often
produce
the
perfection
want

<EOS>
His
endowment
of
this
spot
alone
may
at
any
time
have
place
him
high
among
the
benefactor
of
the
convent

<EOS>
with
the
wall
of

all
the
antiquity

on

of
its
decaying
state

<EOS>
the
new
building
be
not
only
new
,
but
declare
itself
to
be
so
;
intend
only
for
office
,
and
enclose
behind
by
stable
-
yard
,
no
uniformity
of
architecture
have
be
think
necessary
.
<EOS>
Catherine
could
have
rave
at
the
hand
which
have
sweep
away
what
must
have
be
beyond
the
value
of
all
the
rest
,
for
the
purpose
of
mere
domestic
economy
;
and
would
willingly
have
be
spare
the
mortification
of
a
walk
through
scene
so
fallen
,
have
the
general
allow
it
;
but
if
he
have
a
vanity
,
it
be
in
the
arrangement
of
his
office
;
and
as
he
be
convince
that
,
to
a
mind
like
Miss
Morland
's
,
a
view
of
the
accommodation
and
comfort
,
by
which
the
labour
of
her
inferior

soften

always
be
gratify

he
should
make
no
apology
for
lead
her
on
.
<EOS>
They
take
a
slight
survey
of
all
;
and
Catherine
be
impress
,
beyond
her
expectation
,
by
their
multiplicity
and
their
convenience
.
<EOS>
the
purpose
for
which
a
few
shapeless
pantry
and
a
comfortless
scullery
be
deem
sufficient
at
Fullerton
,
be
here
carry
on
in
appropriate
division
,
commodious
and
roomy
.
<EOS>
the
number
of
servant
continually
appear
do
not
strike
her
less
than
the
number
of
their
office
.
<EOS>
wherever
they
go
,
some
pattene
girl
stop
to
curtsy
,
or
some
footman
in
dishabille
sneak
off
.
<EOS>
yet
this
be
an
abbey
!
<EOS>
how
inexpressibly
different
in
these
domestic
arrangement
from
such
as
she
have
read
about
 
from
abbeys
and
castle
,
in
which
,
though
certainly
large
than
Northanger
,
all
the
dirty
work
of
the
house
be
to
be
do
by
two
pair
of
female
hand
at
the
utmost
.
<EOS>
how
they
could
get
through
it
all
have
often
amazed
Mrs.
Allen
;
and
,
when
Catherine
see
what
be
necessary
here
,
she
begin
to
be
amazed
herself
.
  
<EOS>
They
return
to
the
hall
,
that
the
chief
staircase
may
be
ascend
,
and
the
beauty
of
its
wood
,
and
ornament
of
rich
carving
may
be
point
out
:
have
gain
the
top
,
they
turn
in
an
opposite
direction
from
the
gallery
in
which
her
room
lie
,
and
shortly
enter
one
on
the
same
plan
,
but
superior
in
length
and
breadth
.
<EOS>
She
be
here
show
successively
into
three
large
bed
-
chamber
,
with
their
dressing
-
room
,
most
completely
and
handsomely
fit
up

everything
that
money
and
taste
could
do
,
to
give
comfort
and
elegance
to
apartment
,
have
be
bestow
on
these
;
and
,
be
furnish
within
the
last
five
year
,
they
be
perfect
in
all
that
would
be
generally
pleasing
,
and
want
in
all
that
could
give
pleasure
to
Catherine
.
<EOS>
as
they
be
survey
the
last
,
the
general
,
after
slightly
name
a
few
of
the
distinguished
character
by
whom
they
have
at
time
be
honour
,
turn
with
a
smile
countenance
to
Catherine
,
and
venture
to
hope
that
henceforward
some
of
their
early
tenant
may
be
"
our
friend
from
Fullerton
.
"
<EOS>
She
feel
the
unexpected
compliment
,
and
deeply
regret
the
impossibility
of
think
well
of
a
man
so
kindly
disposed
towards
herself
,
and
so
full
of
civility
to
all
her
family
.
  
<EOS>
the
gallery
be
terminate
by
fold
door
,
which
Miss
Tilney
,
advance
,
have
throw
open
,
and
pass
through
,
and
seem
on
the
point
of
do
the
same
by
the
first
door
to
the
left
,
in
another
long
reach
of
gallery
,
when
the
general
,
come
forwards
,
call
her
hastily
,
and
,
as
Catherine
think
,
rather
angrily
back
,
demand
whether
she
be
go
?
 
<EOS>
and
what
be
there
more
to
be
see
?
 
<EOS>
have
not
Miss
Morland
already
see
all
that
could
be
worth
her
notice
?
 
<EOS>
and
do
she
not
suppose
her
friend
may
be
glad
of
some
refreshment
after
so
much
exercise
?
<EOS>
Miss
Tilney
draw
back
directly
,
and
the
heavy
door
be
close
upon
the
mortified
Catherine
,
who
,
have
see
,
in
a
momentary
glance
beyond
them
,
a
narrow
passage
,
more
numerous
opening
,
and
symptom
of
a
winding
staircase
,
believe
herself
at
last
within
the
reach
of
something
worth
her
notice
;
and
feel
,
as
she
unwillingly
pace
back
the
gallery
,
that
she
would
rather
be
allow
to
examine
that
end
of
the
house
than
see
all
the
finery
of
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
the
general
's
evident
desire
of
prevent
such
an
examination
be
an
additional
stimulant
.
<EOS>
something
be
certainly
to
be
conceal
;
her
fancy
,
though
it
have
trespass
lately
once
or
twice
,
could
not
mislead
her
here
;
and
what
that
something
be
,
a
short
sentence
of
Miss
Tilney
's
,
as
they
follow
the
general
at
some
distance
downstairs
,
seem
to
point
out
:
"
I
be
go
to
take
you
into
what
be
my
mother
's
room
 
<EOS>
the
room
in
which
she
die
 
"
be
all
her
word
;
but
few
as
they
be
,
they
convey
page
of
intelligence
to
Catherine
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
wonder
that
the
general
should
shrink
from
the
sight
of
such
object
as
that
room
must
contain
;
a
room
in
all
probability
never
enter
by
him
since
the
dreadful
scene
have
pass
,
which
release
his
suffering
wife
,
and
leave
him
to
the
sting
of
conscience
.
  
<EOS>
She
venture
,
when
next
alone
with
Eleanor
,
to
express
her
wish
of
be
permit
to
see
it
,
as
well
as
all
the
rest
of
that
side
of
the
house
;
and
Eleanor
promise
to
attend
her
there
,
whenever
they
should
have
a
convenient
hour
.
<EOS>
Catherine
understand
her
:
the
general
must
be
watch
from
home
,
before
that
room
could
be
enter
.
<EOS>
"
It
remain
as
it
be
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
say
she
,
in
a
tone
of
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
entirely
.
"
  
"
and
how
long
ago
may
it
be
that
your
mother
die
?

Catherine

,
be
a
trifle
of
time

compare
with
what
generally
elapse
after
the
death
of
an
injure
wife
,
before
her
room
be

to

You

no

Miss

I

from

Her
illness

<EOS>
Catherine
's
blood
run
cold
with
the
horrid
suggestion
which
naturally
spring
from
these
word
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
possible
?
<EOS>
Could
<EOS>
Henry
's
father
 
?
<EOS>
and
yet
how
many
be
the
example
to
justify
even
the
black
suspicion
!
<EOS>
and
,
when
she
see
him
in
the
evening
,
while
she
work
with
her
friend
,
slowly
pace
the
drawing
-
room
for
an
hour
together
in
silent
thoughtfulness
,
with
downcast
eye
and
contract
brow
<EOS>
,
she
feel
secure
from
all
possibility
of
wrong
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
air
and
attitude
of
a
Montoni
!
<EOS>
what
could
more
plainly
speak
the
gloomy
working
of
a
mind
not
wholly
dead
to
every
sense
of
humanity
,
in
its
fearful
review
of
past
scene
of
guilt
?
<EOS>
unhappy
man
!
<EOS>
and
the
anxiousness
of
her
spirit
direct
her
eye
towards
his
figure
so
repeatedly
,
as
to
catch
Miss
Tilney
's
notice
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
,
"
she
whisper
,
"
often
walk
about
the
room
in
this
way
;
it
be
nothing
unusual

"
  
<EOS>
"
so
much
the
bad
!
"
<EOS>
think
Catherine
;
such
ill
-
time
exercise
be
of
a
piece
with
the
strange
unseasonableness
of
his
morning
walk
,
and
bode
nothing
good
.
  
<EOS>
after
an
evening
,
the
little
variety
and
seem
length
of
which
make
her
peculiarly
sensible
of
Henry

importance
among
them
,
she
be
heartily
glad
to
be
dismiss
;
though
it
be
a
look
from
the
general
not
design
for
her
observation
which
send
his
daughter
to
the
bell

<EOS>
when
the
butler
would
have
light
his
master

candle

however
,
he
be
forbid

<EOS>
the
latter
be
not
go
to

<EOS>
"
I
have
many

he
to

"
  
<EOS>
but
neither
the
business
allege
,
nor
the
magnificent
compliment
,
could
win
Catherine
from
think
that
some
very
different
object
must
occasion
so
serious
a
delay
of
proper
repose
.
<EOS>
to
be
keep
up
for
hour
,
after
the
family
be
in
bed
,
by
stupid
pamphlet
be
not
very
likely
.
<EOS>
there
must
be
some
deep
cause
:
something
be
to
be
do
which
could
be
do
only
while
the
household
sleep
;
and
the
probability
that
Mrs.
Tilney
yet
live
,
shut
up
for
cause
unknown
,
and
receive
from
the
pitiless
hand
of
her
husband
a
nightly
supply
of
coarse
food
,
be
the
conclusion
which
necessarily
follow
.
<EOS>
shocking
as
be
the
idea
,
it
be
at
least
better
than
a
death
unfairly
hasten
,
as
,
in
the
natural
course
of
thing
,
she
must
ere
long
be
release
.
<EOS>
the
suddenness
of
her
repute
illness
,
the
absence
of
her
daughter
,
and
probably
of
her
other
child
,
at
the
time
 
all
favour
the
supposition
of
her
imprisonment
.
<EOS>
Its
origin
 
jealousy
perhaps
,
or
wanton
cruelty
 
be
yet
to
be
unravel
.
  
<EOS>
in
revolve
these
matter
,
while
she
undress
,
it
suddenly
strike
her
as
not
unlikely
that
she
may
that
morning
have
pass
near
the
very
spot
of
this
unfortunate
woman
's
confinement
 
may
have
be
within
a
few
pace
of
the
cell
in
which
she
languish
out
her
day
;
for
what
part
of
the
abbey
could
be
more
fit
for
the
purpose
than
that
which
yet
bear
the
trace
of
monastic
division
?
<EOS>
in
the
high
-
arched
passage
,
pave
with
stone
,
which
already
she
have
trodden
with
peculiar
awe
,
she
well
remember
the
door
of
which
the
general
have
give
no
account
.
<EOS>
to
what
may
not
those
door
lead
?
<EOS>
in
support
of
the
plausibility
of
this
conjecture
,
it
further
occur
to
her
that
the
forbid
gallery
,
in
which
lie
the
apartment
of
the
unfortunate
Mrs.
Tilney
,
must
be
,
as
certainly
as
her
memory
could
guide
her
,
exactly
over
this
suspect
range
of
cell
,
and
the
staircase
by
the
side
of
those
apartment
of
which
she
have
catch
a
transient
glimpse
,
communicate
by
some
secret
mean
with
those
cell
,
may
well
have
favour
the
barbarous
proceeding
of
her
husband

<EOS>
down
that
staircase
she
have
perhaps
be
convey
in
a
state
of
well
-
prepare
insensibility
!
  
<EOS>
Catherine
sometimes
start
at
the
boldness
of
her
own
surmise
,
and
sometimes
hope
or
fear
that
she
have
go
too
far
;
but
they
be
support
by
such
appearance
as
make
their
dismissal
impossible
.
  
<EOS>
the
side
of
the
quadrangle
,
in
which
she
suppose
the
guilty
scene
to
be
act
,
be
,
accord
to
her
belief
,
just
opposite
her
own
,
it
strike
her
that
,
if
judiciously
watch
,
some
ray
of
light
from
the
general
's
lamp
may
glimmer
through
the
low
window
,
as
he
pass
to
the
prison
of
his
wife
;
and
,
twice
before
she
step
into
bed
,
she
steal
gently
from
her
room
to
the
correspond
window
in
the
gallery
,
to
see
if
it
appear
;
but
all
abroad
be
dark
,
and
it
must
yet
be
too
early
.
<EOS>
the
various
ascending
noise
convince
her
that
the
servant
must
still
be
up
.
<EOS>
till
midnight
,
she
suppose
it
would
be
in
vain
to
watch
;
but
then
,
when
the
clock
have
strike
twelve
,
and
all
be
quiet
,
she
would
,
if
not
quite
appal
by
darkness
,
steal
out
and
look
once
more
.
<EOS>
the
clock
strike
twelve
 
<EOS>
and
Catherine
have
be
half
an
hour
asleep
.
    
<EOS>
the
next
day
afford
no
opportunity
for
the
propose
examination
of
the
mysterious
apartment
.
<EOS>
It
be
Sunday
,
and
the
whole
time
between
morning
and
afternoon
service
be
require
by
the
general
in
exercise
abroad
or
eat
cold
meat
at
home
;
and
great
as
be
Catherine
's
curiosity
,
her
courage
be
not
equal
to
a
wish
of
explore
them
after
dinner
,
either
by
the
fading
light
of
the
sky
between
six
and
seven
o'clock
,
or
by
the
yet
more
partial
though
strong
illumination
of
a
treacherous
lamp
.
<EOS>
the
day
be
unmarke
therefore
by
anything
to
interest
her
imagination
beyond
the
sight
of
a
very
elegant
monument
to
the
memory
of
Mrs.
Tilney
,
which
immediately
front
the
family
pew
.
<EOS>
by
that
her
eye
be
instantly
catch
and
long
retained
;
and
the
perusal
of
the
highly
strain
epitaph
,
in
which
every
virtue
be
ascribe
to
her
by
the
inconsolable
husband
,
who
must
have
be
in
some
way
or
other
her
destroyer
,
affect
her
even
to
tear
.
  
<EOS>
that
the
general
,
have
erect
such
a
monument
,
should
be
able
to
face
it
,
be
not
perhaps
very
strange
,
and
yet
that
he
could
sit
so
boldly
collect
within
its
view
,
maintain
so
elevate
an
air
,
look
so
fearlessly
around
,
nay
,
that
he
should
even
enter
the
church
,
seem
wonderful
to
Catherine
.
<EOS>
not
,
however
,
that
many
instance
of
being
equally
harden
in
guilt
may
not
be
produce
.
<EOS>
She
could
remember
dozen
who
have
persevere
in
every
possible
vice
,
go
on
from
crime
to
crime
,
murder
whomsoever
they
choose
,
without
any
feeling
of
humanity
or
remorse
;
till
a
violent
death
or
a
religious
retirement
close
their
black
career
.
<EOS>
the
erection
of
the
monument
itself
could
not
in
the
small
degree
affect
her
doubt
of
Mrs.
Tilney
's
actual
decease
.
<EOS>
be
she
even
to
descend
into
the
family
vault
where
her
ashe
be
suppose
to
slumber
,
be
she
to
behold
the
coffin
in
which
they
be
say
to
be
enclose
 
<EOS>
what
could
it
avail
in
such
a
case
?
<EOS>
Catherine
have
read
too
much
not
to
be
perfectly
aware
of
the
ease
with
which
a
waxen
figure
may
be
introduce
,
and
a
supposititious
funeral
carry
on
.
  
<EOS>
the
succeed
morning
promise
something
well
.
<EOS>
the
general
's
early
walk
,
ill
-
time
as
it
be
in
every
other
view
,
be
favourable
here
;
and
when
she
know
him
to
be
out
of
the
house
,
she
directly
propose
to
Miss
Tilney
the
accomplishment
of
her
promise
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
be
ready
to
oblige
her
;
and
Catherine
remind
her
as
they
go
of
another
promise
,
their
first
visit
in
consequence
be
to
the
portrait
in
her
bed
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
It
represent
a
very
lovely
woman
,
with
a
mild
and
pensive
countenance
,
justify
,
so
far
,
the
expectation
of
its
new
observer
;
but
they
be
not
in
every
respect
answer
,
for
Catherine
have
depend
upon
meet
with
feature
,
hair
,
complexion
<EOS>
,
that
should
be
the
very
counterpart
,
the
very
image
,
if
not
of
Henry
's
,
of
Eleanor
's
 
the
only
portrait
of
which
she
have
be
in
the
habit
of
thinking
,
bear
always
an
equal
resemblance
of
mother
and
child
.
<EOS>
a
face
once
take
be
take
for
generation
.
<EOS>
but
here
she
be
oblige
to
look
and
consider
and
study
for
a
likeness
.
<EOS>
She
contemplate
it
,
however
,
in
spite
of
this
drawback
,
with
much
emotion
,
and
,
but
for
a
yet
strong
interest
,
would
have
leave
it
unwillingly
.
  
<EOS>
Her
agitation
as
they
enter
the
great
gallery
be
too
much
for
any
endeavour
at
discourse
;
she
could
only
look
at
her
companion
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
's
countenance
be
deject
,
yet
sedate
;
and
its
composure
speak
her
inure
to
all
the
gloomy
object
to
which
they
be
advance
.
<EOS>
again
she
pass
through
the
fold
door
,
again
her
hand
be
upon
the
important
lock
,
and
Catherine
,
hardly
able
to
breathe
,
be
turn
to
close
the
former
with
fearful
caution
,
when
the
figure
,
the
dread
figure
of
the
general
himself
at
the
further
end
of
the
gallery
,
stand
before
her
!
<EOS>
the
name
of
"
Eleanor
"
at
the
same
moment
,
in
his
loud
tone
,
resound
through
the
building
,
give
to
his
daughter
the
first
intimation
of
his
presence
,
and
to
Catherine
terror
upon
terror
.
<EOS>
an
attempt
at
concealment
have
be
her
first
instinctive
movement
on
perceive
him
,
yet
she
could
scarcely
hope
to
have
escape
his
eye
;
and
when
her
friend
,
who
with
an
apologize
look
dart
hastily
by
her
,
have
join
and
disappear
with
him
,
she
run
for
safety
to
her
own
room
,
and
,
lock
herself
in
,
believe
that
she
should
never
have
courage
to
go
down
again
.
<EOS>
She
remain
there
at
least
an
hour
,
in
the
great
agitation
,
deeply
commiserate
the
state
of
her
poor
friend
,
and
expect
a
summon
herself
from
the
angry
general
to
attend
him
in
his
own
apartment
.
<EOS>
no
summon
,
however
,
arrive
;
and
at
last
,
on
see
a
carriage
drive
up
to
the
abbey
,
she
be
embolden
to
descend
and
meet
him
under
the
protection
of
visitor
.
<EOS>
the
breakfast
-
room
be
gay
with
company
;
and
she
be
name
to
them
by
the
general
as
the
friend
of
his
daughter
,
in
a
complimentary
style
,
which
so
well
conceal
his
resentful
ire
,
as
to
make
her
feel
secure
at
least
of
life
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
and
Eleanor
,
with
a
command
of
countenance
which
do
honour
to
her
concern
for
his
character
,
take
an
early
occasion
of
say
to
her
,
"
My
father
only
want
me
to
answer
a
note
,
"
she
begin
to
hope
that
she
have
either
be
unseen
by
the
general
,
or
that
from
some
consideration
of
policy
she
should
be
allow
to
suppose
herself
so
.
<EOS>
upon
this
trust
she
dare
still
to
remain
in
his
presence
,
after
the
company
leave
them
,
and
nothing
occur
to
disturb
it
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
this
morning
's
reflection
,
she
come
to
a
resolution
of
make
her
next
attempt
on
the
forbidden
door
alone
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
much
well
in
every
respect
that
Eleanor
should
know
nothing
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
to
involve
her
in
the
danger
of
a
second
detection
,
to
court
her
into
an
apartment
which
must
wring
her
heart
,
could
not
be
the
office
of
a
friend
.
<EOS>
the
general
's
utmost
anger
could
not
be
to
herself
what
it
may
be
to
a
daughter
;
and
,
besides
,
she
think
the
examination
itself
would
be
more
satisfactory
if
make
without
any
companion
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
impossible
to
explain
to
Eleanor
the
suspicion
,
from
which
the
other
have
,
in
all
likelihood
,
be
hitherto
happily
exempt
;
nor
could
she
therefore
,
in
her
presence
,
search
for
those
proof
of
the
general
's
cruelty
,
which
however
they
may
yet
have
escape
discovery
,
she
feel
confident
of
somewhere
draw
forth
,
in
the
shape
of
some
fragmented
journal
,
continue
to
the
last
gasp
.
<EOS>
of
the
way
to
the
apartment
she
be
now
perfectly
mistress
;
and
as
she
wish
to
get
it
over
before
Henry
's
return
,
who
be
expect
on
the
morrow
,
there
be
no
time
to
be
lose
.
<EOS>
the
day
be
bright
,
her
courage
high
;
at
four
o'clock
,
the
sun
be
now
two
hour
above
the
horizon
,
and
it
would
be
only
her
retire
to
dress
half
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
do
;
and
Catherine
find
herself
alone
in
the
gallery
before
the
clock
have
cease
to
strike
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
time
for
thought
;
she
hurry
on
,
slip
with
the
least
possible
noise
through
the
fold
door
,
and
without
stop
to
look
or
breathe
,
rush
forward
to
the
one
in
question
.
<EOS>
the
lock
yield
to
her
hand
,
and
,
luckily
,
with
no
sullen
sound
that
could
alarm
a
human
being
.
<EOS>
on
tiptoe
she
enter
;
the
room
be
before
her
;
but
it
be
some
minute
before
she
could
advance
another
step
.
<EOS>
She
behold
what
fix
her
to
the
spot
and
agitate
every
feature
.
<EOS>
She
see
a
large
,
well
-
proportion
apartment
,
an
handsome

<EOS>
Catherine
have
expect
to
have
her
feeling
work
,
and
work
they
be
.
<EOS>
astonishment
and
doubt
first
seize
them
;
and
a
shortly
succeed
ray
of
common
sense
add
some
bitter
emotion
of
shame
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
be
mistake
as
to
the
room
;
but
how
grossly
mistaken
in
everything
else
!
 
<EOS>
in
Miss
Tilney
's
meaning
,
in
her
own
calculation
!
<EOS>
this
apartment
,
to
which
she
have
give
a
date
so
ancient
,
a
position
so
awful
,
prove
to
be
one
end
of
what
the
general
's
father
have
build
.
<EOS>
there
be
two
other
door
in
the
chamber
,
lead
probably
into
dressing
-
closet
;
but
she
have
no
inclination
to
open
either
.
<EOS>
Would
the
veil
in
which
Mrs.
Tilney
have
last
walk
,
or
the
volume
in
which
she
have
last
read
,
remain
to
tell
what
nothing
else
be
allow
to
whisper
?
<EOS>
no
:
whatever
may
have
be
the
general
's
crime
,
he
have
certainly
too
much
wit
to
let
them
sue
for
detection
.
<EOS>
She
be
sick
of
explore
,
and
desire
but
to
be
safe
in
her
own
room
,
with
her
own
heart
only
privy
to
its
folly
;
and
she
be
on
the
point
of
retreat
as
softly
as
she
have
enter
,
when
the
sound
of
footstep
,
she
could
hardly
tell
where
,
make
her
pause
and
tremble
.
<EOS>
to
be
find
there
,
even
by
a
servant
,
would
be
unpleasant
;
but
by
the
general
(
and
he
seem
always
at
hand
when
least
want
)
,
much
bad
!
<EOS>
She
listen
 
the
sound
have
cease
;
and
resolve
not
to
lose
a
moment
,
she
pass
through
and
close
the
door
.
<EOS>
at
that
instant
a
door
underneath
be
hastily
open
;
someone
seem
with
swift
step
to
ascend
the
stair
,
by
the
head
of
which
she
have
yet
to
pass
before
she
could
gain
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
power
to
move
.
<EOS>
with
a
feeling
of
terror
not
very
definable
,
she
fix
her
eye
on
the
staircase
,
and
in
a
few
moment
it
give
Henry
to
her
view
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Tilney
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaim
in
a
voice
of
more
than
common
astonishment
.
<EOS>
He
look
astonished
too
.
<EOS>
"
good
God
!
"
<EOS>
she
continue
,
not
attend
to
his
address
.
<EOS>
"
how
come
you
here
?
<EOS>
how
come
you
up
that
staircase
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
come
I
up
that
staircase
!
"
<EOS>
he
reply
,
greatly
surprised
.
"
<EOS>
because
it
be
my
near
way
from
the
stable
-
yard
to
my
own
chamber
;
and
why
should
I
not
come
up
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
recollect
herself
,
blush
deeply
,
and
could
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
be
look
in
her
countenance
for
that
explanation
which
her
lip
do
not
afford
.
<EOS>
She
move
on
towards
the
gallery
.
"
<EOS>
and
may
I
not
,
in
my
turn
,
"
say
he
,
as
he
push
back
the
fold
door
,
"
ask
how
you
come
here
?
<EOS>
this
passage
be
at
least
as
extraordinary
a
road
from
the
breakfast
-
parlour
to
your
apartment
,
as
that
staircase
can
be
from
the
stable
to
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
,

Catherine
,
look
down

your

there
anything
extraordinary
to

there

"
  
<EOS>
"
no

nothing
at
all

<EOS>
I
think
you
do
not
mean
to
come
back
till
tomorrow

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
expect
to
be
able
to
return
sooner
,
when
I
go
away
;
but
three
hour
ago
I
have
the
pleasure
of
find
nothing
to
detain
me
.
<EOS>
You
look
pale
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
I
alarm
you
by
run
so
fast
up
those
stair

<EOS>
perhaps
you
do
not

you
be
not
aware
of
their
lead
from

common
use

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

I
be
not

<EOS>
You
have
have
a
very
fine
day
for
your
ride

<EOS>

very
;
and
do
Eleanor
leave
you
to
find
your
way
into
all
the
room
in
the
house
by
yourself

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
no
<EOS>
;
she
show
me
over
the
great
part
on
Saturday
 
<EOS>
and
we
be
come
here
to
these
room
 
<EOS>
but
only
"
 
drop
her
voice
 
"
your
father

<EOS>
"
  
"
and
that
prevent
you
,
"
say
Henry
,
earnestly
regard
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
you
look
into
all
the
room
in
that
passage

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

I
only
want
to
see
 
be
not
it
very
late

<EOS>
I
must
go
and
dress
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
only
a
quarter
past
four

show
his
watch

and
you
be
not
now
in
Bath
.
<EOS>
no
theatre
,
no
room
to
prepare
for
.
<EOS>
half
an
hour
at
Northanger
must
be
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
contradict
it
,
and
therefore
suffer
herself
to
be
detain
,
though
her
dread
of
further
question
make
her
,
for
the
first
time
in
their
acquaintance
,
wish
to
leave
him
.
<EOS>
They
walk
slowly
up
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
you
have
any
letter
from
Bath
since
I
see
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

I
be
very
much
surprised

<EOS>
Isabella
promise
so
faithfully
to
write
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
promise
so
faithfully

<EOS>
a
faithful
promise
!
<EOS>
that
puzzle
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
of
a
faithful
performance
.
<EOS>
but
a
faithful
promise
 
the
fidelity
of
promising
!
<EOS>
It
be
a
power
little
worth
know
,
however
,
since
it
can
deceive
and
pain
you

<EOS>
My
mother
's
room
be
very
commodious
,
be
it
not
?
<EOS>
large
and
cheerful
-
looking
,
and
the
dressing
-
closet
so
well
disposed
!
<EOS>
It
always
strike
me
as
the
most
comfortable
apartment
in
the
house
,
and
I
rather
wonder
that
Eleanor
should
not
take
it
for
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
send
you
to
look
at
it
,
I
suppose
?

<EOS>
"
no

<EOS>

It

your

<EOS>
Catherine
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
after
a
short
silence
,
during
which
he
have
closely
observe
her
,
he
add
,
"
as
there
be
nothing
in
the
room
in
itself
to
raise
curiosity
,
this
must
have
proceed
from
a
sentiment
of
respect
for
my
mother
's
character
,
as
describe
by
Eleanor
,
which
do
honour
to
her
memory
.
<EOS>
the
world
,
I
believe
,
never
see
a
well
woman
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
often
that
virtue
can
boast
an
interest
such
as
this
.
<EOS>
the
domestic
,
unpretende
merit
of
a
person
never
know
do
not
often
create
that
kind
of
fervent
,
venerate
tenderness
which
would
prompt
a
visit
like
yours
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
I
suppose
,
have
talk
of
her
a
great
deal
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
that
is
 
no
,
not
much
,
but
what
she
do
say
be
very
interesting
.
<EOS>
Her
die
so
suddenly
"
(
slowly
,
and
with
hesitation
it
be
speak
)
,
"
and
you
 
<EOS>
none
of
you
be
at
home
 
and
your
father
<EOS>
,
I
think
 
perhaps
have
not
be
very
fond
of
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
from
these
circumstance
,
"
he
reply
(
his
quick
eye
fix
on
her
)
,
"
you
infer
perhaps
the
probability
of
some
negligence
 
<EOS>
some
"
 
(
involuntarily
she
shake
her
head
)
 
"
or
it
may
be
 
of
something
still
less
pardonable

<EOS>
She

her
eye

him
more
fully

she
have
ever
do
before

My
mother
's
illness

he
continue
,

the
seizure
which
end
in
her
death

sudden

<EOS>
the
malady
itself
,
one
from
which
she
have
often
suffer
,
a
bilious
fever
 
<EOS>
its
cause
therefore
constitutional
.
<EOS>
on
the
third
day
,
in
short
,
as
soon
as
she
could
be
prevail
on
,
a
physician

a
very
respectable
man

and
one
in
whom
she
have
always
place
great
confidence

upon
his
opinion
of
her
danger

two
other

in
the
next
day

remain
in
almost
constant
attendance
for
four
and
twenty
hour

<EOS>
on
the
fifth
day
she
die

<EOS>
during
the
progress
of
her
disorder
,
Frederick
and
I
(
we
be
both
at
home

see
her
repeatedly
;

from
our
own
observation
can
bear
witness
to
her

receive
every
possible
attention
which
could
spring
from
the
affection
of
those
about
her

or
which
her
situation
in
life
could
command

<EOS>
Poor
Eleanor
be
absent

at
such
a
distance
as
to
return
only
to
see
her
mother
in
her
coffin

His

death

I

Dearest
Miss

what
idea

admit
?

<EOS>
They
have
reach
the
end
of
the
gallery

with
tear
of
shame
she
run
off
to
her
own
room

over

completely
awaken

<EOS>
Henry

address
,
short
as
it
have
be
,
have
more
thoroughly
open
her
eye
to
the
extravagance
of
her
late
fancy
than
all
their
several
disappointment
have
do

<EOS>
most
grievously
be
she
humble
.
<EOS>
most
bitterly
do
she
cry

<EOS>
It
be
not
only
with
herself
that
she
be
sink
 
but
with
Henry
.
<EOS>
Her
folly
,
which
now
seem
even
criminal
,
be
all
expose
to
him
,
and
he
must
despise
her
forever
.
<EOS>
the
liberty
which
her
imagination
have
dare
to
take
with
the
character
of
his
father
 
<EOS>
could
he
ever
forgive
it
?
<EOS>
the
absurdity
of
her
curiosity
and
her
fear
 
<EOS>
could
they
ever
be
forget
?
<EOS>
She
hate
herself
more
than
she
could
express
.
<EOS>
He
have
 
<EOS>
she
think
he
have
,
once
or
twice
before
this
fatal
morning
,
show
something
like
affection
for
her
.
<EOS>
but
now
 
in
short
,
she
make
herself
as
miserable
as
possible
for
about
half
an
hour
,
go
down
when
the
clock
strike
five
,
with
a
break
heart
,
and
could
scarcely
give
an
intelligible
answer
to
Eleanor
's
inquiry
if
she
be
well
.
<EOS>
the
formidable
Henry
soon
follow
her
into
the
room
,
and
the
only
difference
in
his
behaviour
to
her
be
that
he
pay
her
rather
more
attention
than
usual
.
<EOS>
Catherine
have
never
want
comfort
more
,
and
he
look
as
if
he
be
aware
of
it

<EOS>
the
evening
wear
away
with
no
abatement
of
this
soothe
politeness
;
and
her
spirit
be
gradually
raise
to
a
modest
tranquillity
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
learn
either
to
forget
or
defend
the
past
;
but
she
learn
to
hope
that
it
would
never
transpire
farther
,
and
that
it
may
not
cost
her
Henry
's
entire
regard
.
<EOS>
Her
thought
be
still
chiefly
fix
on
what
she
have
with
such
causeless
terror
feel
and
do
,
nothing
could
shortly
be
clear
than
that
it
have
be
all
a
voluntary
,
self
-
create
delusion
,
each
trifle
circumstance
receive
importance
from
an
imagination
resolve
on
alarm
,
and
everything
force
to
bend
to
one
purpose
by
a
mind
which
,
before
she
enter
the
abbey
,
have
be
crave
to
be
frighten
.
<EOS>
She
remember
with
what
feeling
she
have
prepare
for
a
knowledge
of
Northanger

<EOS>
She
see
that
the
infatuation
have
be
create
,
the
mischief
settle
,
long
before
her
quit
Bath
,
and
it
seem
as
if
the
whole
may
be
trace
to
the
influence
of
that
sort
of
reading
which
she
have
there
indulge
.
  
<EOS>
Charming
<EOS>
as
be
all
Mrs.
Radcliffe
's
work
,
and
charm
even
as
be
the
work
of
all
her
imitator

it
be
not
in
them
perhaps
that
human
nature

at

in
the
Midland
county
of
England
,
be
to
be
look

<EOS>
of
the
Alps

Pyrenees
,
with
their
pine
forest

their
vice

they
may
give
a
faithful
delineation
;
and
Italy
,
Switzerland
,
and
the
south
of
France
may
be
as
fruitful
in
horror
as
they
be
there
represent

Catherine
dare
not

beyond
her
own
country
,
and
even
of
that
,
if
hard
pressed
,
would
have
yield
the
northern
and
western
extremity
.
<EOS>
but
in
the
central
part
of
England
there
be
surely
some
security
for
the
existence
even
of
a
wife
not
beloved
,
in
the
law
of
the
land
,
and
the
manner
of
the
age
.
<EOS>
murder
be
not
tolerate
,
servant
be
not
slave
,
and
neither
poison
nor
sleep
potion
to
be
procure
,
like
rhubarb
,
from
every
druggist
.
<EOS>
among
the
Alps
and
Pyrenees
,
perhaps
,
there
be
no
mixed
character
.
<EOS>
there
,
such
as
be
not
as
spotless
as
an
angel
may
have
the
disposition
of
a
fiend
.
<EOS>
but
in
England
it
be
not
so
;
among
the
English
,
she
believe
,
in
their
heart
and
habit
,
there
be
a
general
though
unequal
mixture
of
good
and
bad
.
<EOS>
upon
this
conviction
,
she
would
not
be
surprised
if
even
in
Henry
and
Eleanor
Tilney
,
some
slight
imperfection
may
hereafter
appear
;
and
upon
this
conviction
she
nee
not
fear
to
acknowledge
some
actual
speck
in
the
character
of
their
father
,
who
,
though
clear
from
the
grossly
injurious
suspicion
which
she
must
ever
blush
to
have
entertain
,
she
do
believe
,
upon
serious
consideration
,
to
be
not
perfectly
amiable
.
  
<EOS>
Her
mind
make
up
on
these
several
point
,
and
her
resolution
form
,
of
always
judge
and
act
in
future
with
the
great
good
sense
,
she
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
forgive
herself
and
be
happy
than
ever
;
and
the
lenient
hand
of
time
do
much
for
her
by
insensible
gradation
in
the
course
of
another
day
.
<EOS>
Henry
's
astonishing
generosity
and
nobleness
of
conduct
,
in
never
allude
in
the
slight
way
to
what
have
pass
,
be
of
the
great
assistance
to
her
;
and
sooner
than
she
could
have
suppose
it
possible
in
the
beginning
of
her
distress
,
her
spirit
become
absolutely
comfortable
,
and
capable
,
as
heretofore
,
of
continual
improvement
by
anything
he
say
.
<EOS>
there
be
still
some
subject
,
indeed
,
under
which
she
believe
they
must
always
tremble
 
the
mention
of
a
chest
or
a
cabinet
,
for
instance
 
<EOS>
and
she
do
not
love
the
sight
of
japan
in
any
shape
:
<EOS>
but
even
she
could
allow
that
an
occasional
memento
of
past
folly
,
however
painful
,
may
not
be
without
use
.
  
<EOS>
the
anxiety
of
common
life
begin
soon
to
succeed
to
the
alarm
of
romance
.
<EOS>
Her
desire
of
hearing
from
Isabella
grow
every
day
great
.
<EOS>
She
be
quite
impatient
to
know
how
the
Bath
world
go
on
,
and
how
the
room
be
attend
;
and
especially
be
she
anxious
to
be
assure
of
<EOS>
Isabella
's
have
match
some
fine
netting
-
cotton
,
on
which
she
have
leave
her
intent
;
and
of
her
continue
on
the
good
term
with
James
.
<EOS>
Her
only
dependence
for
information
of
any
kind
be
on
Isabella
.
<EOS>
James
have
protest
against
write
to
her
till
his
return
to
Oxford
;
and
Mrs.
Allen
have
give
her
no
hope
of
a
letter
till
she
have
get
back
to
Fullerton
.
<EOS>
but
Isabella
have
promise
and
promise
again
;
and
when
she
promise
a
thing
,
she
be
so
scrupulous
in
perform
it
!
<EOS>
this
make
it
so
particularly
strange
!
  
<EOS>
for
nine
successive
morning
,
Catherine
wonder
over
the
repetition
of
a
disappointment
,
which
each
morning
become
more
severe
:
but
,
on
the
tenth
,
when
she
enter
the
breakfast
-
room
,
her
first
object
be
a
letter
,
hold
out
by
Henry
's
willing
hand
.
<EOS>
She
thank
him
as
heartily
as
if
he
have
write
it
himself
.
"
<EOS>
'
tis
only
from
James
,
however
,
"
as
she
look
at
the
direction
.
<EOS>
She
open
it
;
it
be
from
Oxford
;
and
to
this
purpose
:
  
"
dear
Catherine
,
  
"
<EOS>
though
,
God
know
,
with
little
inclination
for
writing
,
I
think
it
my
duty
to
tell
you
that
everything
be
at
an
end
between
Miss
Thorpe
and
me
.
<EOS>
I
leave
her
and
Bath
yesterday
,
never
to
see
either
again
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
enter
into
particular
 
they
would
only
pain
you
more
.
<EOS>
You
will
soon
hear
enough
from
another
quarter
to
know
where
lie
the
blame
;
and
I
hope
will
acquit
your
brother
of
everything
<EOS>
but
the
folly
of
too
easily
think
his
affection
return
.
<EOS>
thank
God
!
<EOS>
I
be
undeceived
in
time
!
<EOS>
but
it
be
a
heavy
blow
!
<EOS>
after
my
father
's
consent
have
be
so
kindly
give
 
<EOS>
but
no
more
of
this
.
<EOS>
She
have
make
me
miserable
forever
!
<EOS>
let
me
soon
hear
from
you
,
dear
Catherine
;
you
be
my
only
friend
;
your
love
I
do
build
upon
.
<EOS>
I
wish
your
visit
at
Northanger
may
be
over
before
Captain
Tilney
make
his
engagement
know
,
or
you
will
be
uncomfortably
circumstance
.
<EOS>
poor
Thorpe
be
in
town
:
I
dread
the
sight
of
him
;
his
honest
heart
would
feel
so
much
.
<EOS>
I
have
write
to
him
and
my
father
.
<EOS>
Her
duplicity
hurt
me
more
than
all
;
till
the
very
last
,
if
I
reason
with
her
,
she
declare
herself
as
much
attach
to
me
as
ever
,
and
laugh
at
my
fear
.
<EOS>
I
be
ashamed
to
think
how
long
I
bear
with
it
;
but
if
ever
man
have
reason
to
believe
himself
love
,
I
be
that
man
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
understand
even
now
what
she
would
be
at
,
for
there
could
be
no
need
of
my
being
play
off
to
make
her
secure
of
Tilney
.
<EOS>
We
part
at
last
by
mutual
consent
 
happy
for
me
<EOS>
have
we
never
meet
!
<EOS>
I
can
never
expect
to
know
such
another
woman
!
<EOS>
Dearest
Catherine
,
beware
how
you
give
your
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
believe
me
,
"
&
c.
  
Catherine
have
not
read
three
line
before
her
sudden
change
of
countenance
,
and
short
exclamation
of
sorrow
wonder
,
declare
her
to
be
receive
unpleasant
news
;
and
Henry
,
earnestly
watch
her
through
the
whole
letter
,
see
plainly
that
it
end
no
better
than
it
begin
.
<EOS>
He
be
prevent
,
however
,
from
even
look
his
surprise
by
his
father
's
entrance
.
<EOS>
They
go
to
breakfast
directly
;
but
Catherine
could
hardly
eat
anything
.
<EOS>
tear
fill
her
eye
,
and
even
run
down
her
cheek
as
she
sit
.
<EOS>
the
letter
be
one
moment
in
her
hand
,
then
in
her
lap
,
and
then
in
her
pocket
;
and
she
look
as
if
she
know
not
what
she
do
.
<EOS>
the
general
,
between
his
cocoa
and
his
newspaper
,
have
luckily
no
leisure
for
notice
her
;
but
to
the
other
two
her
distress
be
equally
visible
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
dare
leave
the
table
she
hurry
away
to
her
own
room
;
but
the
housemaid
be
busy
in
it
,
and
she
be
oblige
to
come
down
again
.
<EOS>
She
turn
into
the
drawing
-
room
for
privacy
,
but
Henry
and
Eleanor
have
likewise
retreat
thither
,
and
be
at
that
moment
deep
in
consultation
about
her
.
<EOS>
She
draw
back
,
try
to
beg
their
pardon
,
but
be
,
with
gentle
violence
,
force
to
return
;
and
the
other
withdraw
,
after
Eleanor
have
affectionately
express
a
wish
of
be
of
use
or
comfort
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
after
half
an
hour
's
free
indulgence
of
grief
and
reflection
,
Catherine
feel
equal
to
encounter
her
friend
;
but
whether
she
should
make
her
distress
know
to
them
be
another
consideration
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
if
particularly
question
,
she
may
just
give
an
idea
 
just
distantly
hint
at
it
 
but
not
more
.
<EOS>
to
expose
a
friend
,
such
a
friend
as
Isabella
have
be
to
her
 
<EOS>
and
then
their
own
brother
so
closely
concerned
in
it
!
<EOS>
She
believe
she
must
waive
the
subject
altogether
.
<EOS>
Henry
and
Eleanor
be
by
themselves
in
the
breakfast
-
room
;
and
each
,
as
she
enter
it
,
look
at
her
anxiously
.
<EOS>
Catherine
take
her
place
at
the
table
,
and
,
after
a
short
silence
,
Eleanor
say
,
"
no
bad
news
from
Fullerton
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Morland
 
<EOS>
your
brother
and
sister
 
I
hope
they
be
none
of
them
ill
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
thank
you
"
(
sigh
as
she
speak
)
;
"
they
be
all
very
well
.
<EOS>
My
letter
be
from
my
brother
at
Oxford
.
"
  
<EOS>
nothing
further
be
say
for
a
few
minute
;
and
then
speak
through
her
tear
,
she
add
,
"
I
do
not
think
I
shall
ever
wish
for
a
letter
again
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
,
"
say
Henry
,
close
the
book
he
have
just
open
;
"
if
I
have
suspect
the
letter
of
contain
anything
unwelcome
,
I
should
have
give
it
with
very
different
feeling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
contain
something
bad
than
anybody
could
suppose
!
<EOS>
Poor
James
be
so
unhappy
!
<EOS>
You
will
soon
know
why
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
to
have
so
kind
-
hearted
,
so
affectionate
a
sister
,
"
reply
Henry
warmly
,
"
must
be
a
comfort
to
him
under
any
distress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
one
favour
to
beg
,
"
say
Catherine
,
shortly
afterwards
,
in
an
agitated
manner
,
"
that
,
if
your
brother
should
be
come
here
,
you
will
give
me
notice
of
it
,
that
I
may
go
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Our
brother
!
<EOS>
Frederick
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
be
sure
I
should
be
very
sorry
to
leave
you
so
soon
,
but
something
have
happen
that
would
make
it
very
dreadful
for
me
to
be
in
the
same
house
with
Captain
Tilney
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
's
work
be
suspend
while
she
gaze
with
increase
astonishment
;
but
Henry
begin
to
suspect
the
truth
,
and
something
,
in
which
Miss
Thorpe
's
name
be
include
,
pass
his
lip
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
quick
you
be
!
"
cry
Catherine
:
"
you
have
guess
it
,
I
declare
!
<EOS>
and
yet
,
when
we
talk
about
it
in
Bath
,
you
little
thought
of
its
ending
so
.
<EOS>
Isabella
 
<EOS>
no
wonder
now
<EOS>
I
have
not
hear
from
her
 
Isabella
<EOS>
have
desert
my
brother
,
and
be
to
marry
your
!
<EOS>
Could
you
have
believe
there
have
be
such
inconstancy
and
fickleness
,
and
everything
that
be
bad
in
the
world

<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
so
far
as
concern
my
brother

you

misinform

<EOS>
I
hope
he
have
not
have
any
material
share
in
bring
on
Mr.
Morland
's
disappointment
.
<EOS>
His
marrying
Miss
Thorpe
be
not
probable

<EOS>
I
think
you
must
be
deceive
so
far
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
sorry
for
Mr.
Morland
 
sorry
that
anyone
you
love
should
be
unhappy
;

my
surprise
would
be
great
at
Frederick

marry
her
than
at
any
other
part
of
the
story

<EOS>

<EOS>

It
be
very
true
,
however
;
you
shall
read
James
's
letter
yourself

stay
 
<EOS>
there
be
one
part

recollect
with
a
blush
the
last
line

"
Will
you
take
the
trouble
of
read
to
us
the
passage
which
concern
my
brother

<EOS>
"
no

it
yourself

cry
Catherine

whose
second
thought
be
clear

"
I
do
not

what
I

blush
again
that

"
James

<EOS>
He
gladly
receive
the
letter

have
read
it
through
,
with
close
attention

return
it

,
"
<EOS>
well

if
it
be

so

Frederick

his

I
do
not
envy
his
situation

either
as
a
lover

a
son

<EOS>
Miss
Tilney
,
at
Catherine
's
invitation
,
now
read
the
letter
likewise
,
and
,
have
express
also
her
concern
and
surprise
,
begin
to
inquire
into
Miss
Thorpe

connection
and
fortune

"
Her
mother

a
very
good

Catherine

answer

<EOS>
"
what
be
her
father
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
lawyer

I
believe

no

I
do
not
believe
Isabella
have
any
fortune
at
all
:
but
that
will
not
signify
in
your
family

<EOS>
Your
father
be
so
very
liberal
!
<EOS>
He
tell
me
the
other
day
that
he
only
value
money
as
it

him
to
promote
the
happiness
of
his
child

<EOS>
the
brother

at
each
other

but
,
"
say
Eleanor
,
after
a
short
pause
,
"
would
it
be
to
promote
his
happiness

to
enable
him
to
marry
such
a
girl

<EOS>
She
must
be
an
unprincipled
one
,
or
she
could
not
have
use
your
brother
so

how
strange
an
infatuation

side

the
most
unpromising

the
strong

him

I

I
give
him
up

moreover

I
have

good

an
opinion

Miss
Thorpe

prudence

Henry

You

and
,
upon
my

there
be
some
thing
that
seem
very

it

I
can
not
forget
that
,
when

know

My

disappointment

loss
in

Your

we

undervalue

You
feel

"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
,
by
some
chance
or
other
,
find
her
spirit
so
very
much
relieve
by
this
conversation
that
she
could
not
regret
her
be
lead
on
,
though
so
unaccountably
,
to
mention
the
circumstance
which
have
produce
it
.
    
<EOS>
from
this
time
,
the
subject
be
frequently
canvass
by
the
three
young
people
;
and
Catherine
find
,
with
some
surprise
,
that
her
two
young
friend
be
perfectly
agree
in
consider
Isabella
's
want
of
consequence
and
fortune
as
likely
to
throw
great
difficulty
in
the
way
of
her
marry
their
brother
.
<EOS>
Their
persuasion
that
the
general
would
,
upon
this
ground
alone
,
independent
of
the
objection
that
may
be
raise
against
her
character
,
oppose
the
connection
,
turn
her
feeling
moreover
with
some
alarm
towards
herself
.
<EOS>
She
be
as
insignificant
,
and
perhaps
as
portionless
,
as
Isabella
;
and
if
the
heir
of
the
Tilney
property
have
not
grandeur
and
wealth
enough
in
himself
,
at
what
point
of
interest
be
the
demand
of
his
young
brother
to
rest
?
<EOS>
the
very
painful
reflection
to
which
this
thought
lead
could
only
be
disperse
by
a
dependence
on
the
effect
of
that
particular
partiality
,
which
,
as
she
be
give
to
understand
by
his
word
as
well
as
his
action
,
she
have
from
the
first
be
so
fortunate
as
to
excite
in
the
general
;
and
by
a
recollection
of
some
most
generous
and
disintereste
sentiment
on
the
subject
of
money
,
which
she
have
more
than
once
hear
him
utter
,
and
which
tempt
her
to
think
his
disposition
in
such
matter
misunderstood
by
his
child
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
so
fully
convinced
,
however
,
that
their
brother
would
not
have
the
courage
to
apply
in
person
for
his
father
's
consent
,
and
so
repeatedly
assure
her
that
he
have
never
in
his
life
be
less
likely
to
come
to
Northanger
than
at
the
present
time
,
that
she
suffer
her
mind
to
be
at
ease
as
to
the
necessity
of
any
sudden
removal
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
but
as
it
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
Captain
Tilney
,
whenever
he
make
his
application
,
would
give
his
father
any
just
idea
of
Isabella
's
conduct
,
it
occur
to
her
as
highly
expedient
that
Henry
should
lay
the
whole
business
before
him
as
it
really
be
,
enable
the
general
by
that
mean
to
form
a
cool
and
impartial
opinion
,
and
prepare
his
objection
on
a
fairer
ground
than
inequality
of
situation
.
<EOS>
She
propose
it
to
him
accordingly
;
but
he
do
not
catch
at
the
measure
so
eagerly
as
she
have
expect
.

He
must
tell
his
own
story
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

but
he
will
tell
only
half
of
it

"
  
<EOS>

a
quarter
would
be
enough

"
  
<EOS>
a
day
or
two
pass
away
and
bring
no
tiding
of
Captain
Tilney
.
<EOS>
His
brother
and
sister
know
not
what
to
think
.
<EOS>
sometimes
it
appear
to
them
as
if
his
silence
would
be
the
natural
result
of
the
suspect
engagement
,
and
at
other
that
it
be
wholly
incompatible
with
it
.
<EOS>
the
general
,
meanwhile
,
though
offend
every
morning
by
Frederick
's
remissness
in
writing
,
be
free
from
any
real
anxiety
about
him
,
and
have
no
more
pressing
solicitude
than
that
of
make
Miss
Morland
's
time
at
Northanger
pass
pleasantly
.
<EOS>
He
often
express
his
uneasiness
on
this
head
,
fear
the
sameness
of
every
day
's
society
and
employment
would
disgust
her
with
the
place
,
wish
the
Lady
Frasers
have
be
in
the
country
,
talk
every
now
and
then
of
have
a
large
party
to
dinner
,
and
once
or
twice
begin
even
to
calculate
the
number
of
young
dancing
people
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
but
then
it
be
such
a
dead
time
of
year
,
no
wild
-
fowl
,
no
game
,
and
the
Lady
Frasers
be
not
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
and
it
all
end
,
at
last
,
in
his
tell
Henry
one
morning
that
when
he
next
go
to
Woodston
,
they
would
take
him
by
surprise
there
some
day
or
other
,
and
eat
their
mutton
with
him
.
<EOS>
Henry
be
greatly
honoured
and
very
happy

Catherine
be
quite
delighted
with
the
scheme
.
<EOS>
"
and
when
do
you
think
,
sir
,
I
may
look
forward
to
this
pleasure
?
<EOS>
I
must
be
at
Woodston
on
Monday
to
attend
the
parish
meeting
,

shall
probably
be
oblige
to
stay
two
or
three
day
.

well

well

we
will
take
our
chance
some
one
of

fix
.

You
be
not

put
yourself
at
all
out

your
way

whatever
you
may
happen
to
have
in

house
will
be
enough

think
I
can
answer

the
young
lady

allowance
for
a
bachelor

table

me
see
;
Monday
will
be
a
busy
day
with
you
,
we
will
not
come
on
Monday
;
and
Tuesday
will
be
a
busy
one
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
expect
my
surveyor
from
Brockham
with
his
report
in
the
morning
;
and
afterwards
I
can
not
in
<EOS>
decency
fail
attend
the
club
.
<EOS>
I
really
could
not
face
my
acquaintance
if
I
stay
away
now
;
for
,
as
I
be
know
to
be
in
the
country
,
it
would
be
take
exceedingly
amiss
;
and
it
be
a
rule
with
me
,
Miss
Morland
,
never
to
give
offence
to
any
of
my
neighbour
,
if
a
small
sacrifice
of
time
and
attention
can
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
They
be
a
set
of
very
worthy
man
.
<EOS>
They
have
half
a
buck
from
Northanger
twice
a
year
;
and
I
dine
with
them
whenever
I
can
.
<EOS>
Tuesday
,
therefore
,
we
may
say
be
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
but
on
Wednesday
,
I
think
,
Henry
,
you
may
expect
us
;
and
we
shall
be
with
you
early
,
that
we
may
have
time
to
look
about
us

<EOS>
two
hour
and
three
quarter
will
carry
us
to
Woodston

I
suppose
;
we
shall
be
in
the
carriage
by
ten

so
,
about
a
quarter
before
one
on
Wednesday
,
you
may
look
for
us

a
ball
itself
could
not
have
be
more
welcome
to
Catherine
than
this
little
excursion
,
so
strong
be
her
desire
to
be
acquaint
with
Woodston
;
and
her
heart
be
still
bound
with
joy
when
Henry
,
about
an
hour
afterwards
,
come
boot
and
greatcoate
into
the
room
where
she
and
Eleanor
be
sit
,
and
say
,
"
I
be
come
,
young
lady

in
a
very
moralizing
strain
,
to
observe
that
our
pleasure
in
this
world
be
always
to
be
pay
for
,
and
that
we
often
purchase
them
at

actual

myself

at

to
hope

satisfaction

see

bad
weather

why

why
!
<EOS>
how
can
you
ask
the
question

no
time
be

in
frighten
my
old
housekeeper
out
of
her
wit

I
must
go
and
prepare
a
dinner
for
you

to
be
sure

not

"
aye

sadly
too
 
for
I
have
much
rather
stay

<EOS>
"
but
how
can
you
think
of
such
a
thing
,
after
what
the
general
say
?
<EOS>
when
he
so
particularly
desire
you
not
to
give
yourself
any
trouble
,

anything
would
do

<EOS>
Henry
only
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
it
be
quite
unnecessary
upon
your
sister

account

mine

<EOS>
You
must
know
it
to
be
so
;
and
the
general
make
such
a
point
of
your
provide
nothing
extraordinary
:
besides
,
if
he
have
not
say
half
so
much
as
he
do
,
he
have
always
such
an
excellent
dinner
at
home
,
that
sit
down
to
a
middling
one
for
one
day
could
not
signify
.

I
wish
I
could
reason

good

<EOS>
He
go
;
and
,
it
be
at
any
time
a
much
simple
operation
to
Catherine
to
doubt
her
own
judgment
than
Henry
's
,
<EOS>
she
be
very
soon
oblige
to
give
him
credit
for
be
right
,
however
disagreeable
to
her
his
going
.
<EOS>
but
the
inexplicability
of
the
general
's
conduct
dwell
much
on
her
thought
.
<EOS>
that
he
be
very
particular
in
his
eating
<EOS>
,
she
have
,
by
her
own
unassisted
observation
,
already
discover
;
but
why
he
should
say
one
thing
so
positively
,
and
mean
another
all
the
while
,
be
most
unaccountable
!
<EOS>
how
be
people
,
at
that
rate
,
to
be
understand
?

who
but
Henry
could
have
be
aware
of
what
his
father
be
at
?
  
<EOS>
from
Saturday
to
Wednesday
,
however
,
they
be
now
to
be
without
Henry
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
sad
finale
of
every
reflection
:
and
Captain
Tilney
's
letter
would
certainly
come
in
his
absence
;
and
Wednesday
she
be
very
sure
would
be
wet
.
<EOS>
the
past
,
present
,
and
future
be
all
equally
in
gloom
.
<EOS>
Her
brother
so
unhappy
,
and
her
loss
in
Isabella
so
great
;
and
Eleanor
's
spirit
always
affect
by
Henry
's
absence
!
<EOS>
what
be
there
to
interest
or
amuse
her
?
<EOS>
She
be
tired
of
the
wood
and
the
shrubbery
 
always
so
smooth
and
so
dry
;
and
the
abbey
in
itself
be
no
more
to
her
now
than
any
other
house
.
<EOS>
the
painful
remembrance
of
the
folly
it
have
help
to
nourish
and
perfect
be
the
only
emotion
which
could
spring
from
a
consideration
of
the
building
.
<EOS>
what
a
revolution
in
her
idea
!
<EOS>
She
,
who
have
so
long
to
be
in
an
abbey
!
<EOS>
now
,
there
be
nothing
so
charming
to
her
imagination
as
the
unpretende
comfort
of
a
well
-
connect
parsonage
,
something
like
Fullerton
,
but
better
<EOS>
:
Fullerton
have
its
fault
,
but
Woodston
probably
have
none
.
<EOS>
if
Wednesday
should
ever
come
!
  
<EOS>
It
do
come
,
and
exactly
when
it
may
be
reasonably
look
for
.
<EOS>
It
come
 
<EOS>
it
be
fine
 
and
Catherine
trod
on
air
.
<EOS>
by
ten
o'clock
,
the
chaise
and
four
convey
the
trio
from
the
abbey
;
and
,
after
an
agreeable
drive
of
almost
twenty
mile
,
they
enter
Woodston
,
a
large
and
populous
village
,
in
a
situation
not
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
Catherine
be
ashamed
to
say
how
pretty
she
think
it
,
as
the
general
seem
to
think
an
apology
necessary
for
the
flatness
of
the
country
,
and
the
size
of
the
village
;
but
in
her
heart
she
prefer
it
to
any
place
she
have
ever
be
at
,
and
look
with
great
admiration
at
every
neat
house
above
the
rank
of
a
cottage
,
and
at
all
the
little
chandler
's
shop
which
they
pass
.

at
the
further
end
of
the
village
,
and
tolerably
disengage
from
the
rest
of
it
,
stand
the
parsonage
,
a
new
-
build
substantial
stone
house
,
with
its
semicircular
sweep
and
green
gate
;
and
,
as
they
drive
up
to
the
door
,
Henry
,
with
the
friend
of
his
solitude
,
a
large
Newfoundland
puppy
and
two
or
three
terrier
,
be
ready
to
receive
and
make
much
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
's
mind
be
too
full
,
as
she
enter
the
house
,
for
her
either
to
observe
or
to
say
a
great
deal
;
and
,
till
call
on
by
the
general
for
her
opinion
of
it
<EOS>
,
she
have
very
little
idea
of
the
room
in
which
she
be
sit
.
<EOS>
upon
look
round
it
then
,
she
perceive
in
a
moment
that
it
be
the
most
comfortable
room
in
the
world
;
but
she
be
too
guard
to
say
so
,
and
the
coldness
of
her
praise
disappoint
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
not
call
it
a
good
house
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
not
compare
it
with
Fullerton
and
Northanger
 
<EOS>
we
be
consider
it
as
a
mere
parsonage
,
small
and
confine
,
we
allow
,
but
decent
,
perhaps
,
and
habitable
;
and
altogether
not
inferior
to
the
generality
;
or
<EOS>
,
in
other
word
,
I
believe
there
be
few
country
parsonage
in
England
half
so
good
.
<EOS>
It
may
admit
of
improvement
,
however
.
<EOS>
far
be
it
from
me
to
say
otherwise
;
and
anything
in
reason
 
a
bow
throw
out
,
perhaps
 
though
,
between
ourselves
,
if
there
be
one
thing
more
than
another
my
aversion
,
it
be
a
patch
-
on
bow

"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
do
not
hear
enough
of
this
speech
to
understand
or
be
pain
by
it
;
and
other
subject
be
studiously
bring
forward
and
support
by
Henry
,
at
the
same
time
that
a
tray
full
of
refreshment
be
introduce
by
his
servant
,
the
general
be
shortly
restore
to
his
complacency
,
and
Catherine
to
all
her
usual
ease
of
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
the
room
in
question
be
of
a
commodious
,
well
-
proportion
size
,
and
handsomely
fit
up
as
a
dining

parlour

on
their

round

first
into
a
small
apartment
,
belong
peculiarly
to
the
master
of
the
house

and
make
unusually
tidy
on
the
occasion
;

afterwards
into
what
be
to
be
the
drawing

room
,
with
the
appearance
of
which
,
though
unfurnished
,
Catherine
be
delighted
enough
even
to
satisfy
the
general
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
prettily
shaped
room
,
the
window
reach
to
the
ground
,
and
the
view
from
them
pleasant
,
though
only
over
green
meadow
;
and
she
express
her
admiration
at
the
moment
with
all
the
honest
simplicity
with
which
she
feel
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
why
do
not
you
fit
up
this
room
,
Mr.
Tilney

<EOS>
what
a
pity
not
to
have
it
fit
up

<EOS>
It
be
the
prettiest
room
I
ever
see

it
be
the
prettiest
room
in

<EOS>
"
I
trust

say
the
general
,
with
a
most
satisfied
smile

that
it
will
very
speedily
be
furnish

only
for

"
well
,
if
it
be
my

I
should
never

<EOS>
oh
!

what
a
sweet
little
cottage
there
be
among

tree
 
apple

You

remember
that
Robinson

to
about
it

the
cottage

"
  
<EOS>
such
a
compliment
recall
all
Catherine
's
consciousness
,
and
silence
her
directly
;
and
,
though
pointedly
apply
to
by
the
general
for
her
choice
of
the
prevail
colour
of
the
paper
and
hanging
,
nothing
like
an
opinion
on
the
subject
could
be
draw
from
her
.
<EOS>
the
influence
of
fresh
object
and
fresh
air
,
however
,
be
of
great
use
in
dissipate
these
embarrassing
association
;
and
,
have
reach
the
ornamental
part
of
the
premise
,
consist
of
a
walk
round
two
side
of
a
meadow
,
on
which
Henry
's
genius
have
begin
to
act
about
half
a
year
ago
,
she
be
sufficiently
recover
to
think
it
pretty
than
any
pleasure
-
ground
she
have
ever
be
in
before
,
though
there
be
not
a
shrub
in
it
high
than
the
green
bench
in
the
corner
.
  
<EOS>
a
saunter
into
other
meadow
,
and
through
part
of
the
village
,
with
a
visit
to
the
stable
to
examine
some
improvement
,
and
a
charming
game
of
play
with
a
litter
of
puppy
just
able
to
roll
about
,
bring
them
to
four
o'clock
,
when
Catherine
scarcely
think
it
could
be
three
.
<EOS>
at
four
they
be
to
dine
,
and
at
six
to
set
off
on
their
return
.
<EOS>
never
have
any
day
pass
so
quickly
!
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
but
observe
that
the
abundance
of
the
dinner
do
not
seem
to
create
the
small
astonishment
in
the
general
;
nay
,
that
he
be
even
look
at
the
side
-
table
for
cold
meat
which
be
not
there
.
<EOS>
His
son
and
daughter
's
observation
be
of
a
different
kind
.
<EOS>
They
have
seldom
see
him
eat
so
heartily
at
any
table
but
his
own
,
and
never
before
know
him
so
little
disconcert
by
the
melted
butter
's
be
oil
.
  
<EOS>
at
six
o'clock
,
the
general
have
take
his
coffee
,
the
carriage
again
receive
them
;
and
so
gratifying
have
be
the
tenor
of
his
conduct
throughout
the
whole
visit
,
so
well
assured
be
her
mind
on
the
subject
of
his
expectation
,
that
,
could
she
have
feel
equally
confident
of
the
wish
of
his
son
,
Catherine
would
have
quit
Woodston
with
little
anxiety
as
to
the
How
or
the
when
she
may
return
to
it
.
    
<EOS>
the
next
morning
bring
the
follow
very
unexpected
letter
from
Isabella
:
  
Bath
,
April
  
<EOS>
My
dear
catherine
,
I
receive
your
two
kind
letter
with
the
great
delight
,
and
have
a
thousand
apology
to
make
for
not
answer
them
sooner
.
<EOS>
I
really
be
quite
ashamed
of
my
idleness
;
but
in
this
horrid
place
one
can
find
time
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
my
pen
in
my
hand
to
begin
a
letter
to
you
almost
every
day
since
you
leave
Bath
,
but
have
always
be
prevent
by
some
silly
trifler
or
other
.
<EOS>
pray
write
to
me
soon
,
and
direct
to
my
own
home
.
<EOS>
thank
God
,
we
leave
this
vile
place
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
since
you
go
away
,
I
have
have
no
pleasure
in
it
 
<EOS>
the
dust
be
beyond
anything
;
and
everybody
one
care
for
be
go
.
<EOS>
I
believe
if
I
could
see
you
I
should
not
mind
the
rest
,
for
you
be
dearer
to
me
than
anybody
can
conceive
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
uneasy
about
your
dear
brother
,
not
have
hear
from
him
since
he
go
to
Oxford
;
and
be
fearful
of
some
misunderstanding
.
<EOS>
Your
kind
office
will
set
all
right
:
he
be
the
only
man
I
ever
do
or
could
love
,
and
I
trust
you
will
convince
him
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
spring
fashion
be
partly
down
;
and
the
hat
the
most
frightful
you
can
imagine
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
spend
your
time
pleasantly
,
but
be
afraid
you
never
think
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
all
that
I
could
of
the
family
you
be
with
,
because
I
would
not
be
ungenerous
,
or
set
you
against
those
you
esteem
;
but
it
be
very
difficult
to
know
whom
to
trust
,
and
young
man
never
know
their
mind
two
day
together
.
<EOS>
I
rejoice
to
say
that
the
young
man
whom
,
of
all
other
,
I
particularly
abhor
,
have
leave
Bath
.
<EOS>
You
will
know
,
from
this
description
,
I
must
mean
Captain
Tilney
,
who
,
as
you
may
remember
,
be
amazingly
dispose
to
follow
and
tease
me
,
before
you
go
away
.
<EOS>
afterwards
he
get
bad
,
and
become
quite
my
shadow
.
<EOS>
many
girl
may
have
be
take
in
,
for
never
be
such
attention
;
but
I
know
the
fickle
sex
too
well
.
<EOS>
He
go
away
to
his
regiment
two
day
ago
,
and
I
trust
I
shall
never
be
plague
with
him
again
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
great
coxcomb
I
ever
see
,
and
amazingly
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
the
last
two
day
he
be
always
by
the
side
of
Charlotte
Davis
<EOS>
:
I
pity
his
taste
,
but
take
no
notice
of
him
.
<EOS>
the
last
time
we
meet
be
in
Bath
Street
,
and
I
turn
directly
into
a
shop
that
he
may
not
speak
to
me
;
I
would
not
even
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
He
go
into
the
pump
-
room
afterwards
;
but
I
would
not
have
follow
him
for
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
such
a
contrast
between
him
and
your
brother
!
<EOS>
pray
send
me
some
news
of
the
latter
 
<EOS>
I
be
quite
unhappy
about
him
;
he
seem
so
uncomfortable
when
he
go
away
,
with
a
cold
,
or
something
that
affect
his
spirit
.
<EOS>
I
would
write
to
him
myself
,
but
have
mislay
his
direction
;
and
,
as
I
hint
above
,
be
afraid
he
take
something
in
my
conduct
amiss
.
<EOS>
pray
explain
everything
to
his
satisfaction
;
or
,
if
he
still
harbour
any
doubt
,
a
line
from
himself
to
me
,
or
a
call
at
Putney
when
next
in
town
,
may
set
all
to
right
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
be
to
the
room
this
age
,
nor
to
the
play
,
except
go
in
last
night
with
the
Hodges
,
for
a
frolic
,
at
half
price
:
they
tease
me
into
it
;
and
I
be
determine
they
should
not
say
I
shut
myself
up
because
Tilney
be
go
.
<EOS>
We
happen
to
sit
by
the
Mitchells
,
and
they
pretend
to
be
quite
surprised
to
see
me
out
.
<EOS>
I
know
their
spite
:
at
one
time
they
could
not
be
civil
to
me
,
but
now
they
be
all
friendship
;
but
I
be
not
such
a
fool
as
to
be
take
in
by
them
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
have
a
pretty
good
spirit
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
Anne
Mitchell
have
try
to
put
on
a
turban
like
mine
,
as
I
wear
it
the
week
before
at
the
concert
,
but
make
wretched
work
of
it
 
<EOS>
it
happen
to
become
my
odd
face
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
at
least
Tilney
tell
me
so
at
the
time
,
and
say
every
eye
be
upon
me
;
but
he
be
the
last
man
whose
word
I
would
take
.
<EOS>
I
wear
nothing
but
purple
now
:
<EOS>
I
know
I
look
hideous
in
it
,
but
no
matter
 
it
be
your
dear
brother
's
favourite
colour
.
<EOS>
lose
no
time
,
my
dear
,
sweetest
Catherine
,
in
write
to
him
and
to
me
,
who
ever
be
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
such
a
strain
of
shallow
artifice
could
not
impose
even
upon
Catherine
.
<EOS>
Its
inconsistency
,
contradiction
,
and
falsehood
strike
her
from
the
very
first
.
<EOS>
She
be
ashamed
of
Isabella
,
and
ashamed
of
have
ever
love
her
.
<EOS>
Her
profession
of
attachment
be
now
as
disgusting
as
her
excuse
be
empty
,
and
her
demand
impudent
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
write
to
James
on
her
behalf
!
<EOS>
no
,
James
should
never
hear
Isabella
's
name
mention
by
her
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
on
Henry
's
arrival
from
Woodston
,
she
make
known
to
him
and
Eleanor
their
brother
's
safety
,
congratulate
them
with
sincerity
on
it
,
and
read
aloud
the
most
material
passage
of
her
letter
with
strong
indignation
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
finish
it
 
"
so
much
for
Isabella
,
"
she
cry
,
"
and
for
all
our
intimacy
!
<EOS>
She
must
think
me
an
idiot
,
or
she
could
not
have
write
so
;
but
perhaps
this
have
serve
to
make
her
character
better
know
to
me
than
mine
be
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
see
what
she
have
be
about
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
vain
coquette
,
and
her
trick
have
not
answer
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
she
have
ever
any
regard
either
for
James
or
for
me
,
and
I
wish
I
have
never
know
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
soon
be
as
if
you
never
have
,
"
say
Henry
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
but
one
thing
that
I
can
not
understand
.
<EOS>
I
see
that
she
have
have
design
on
Captain
Tilney
,
which
have
not
succeed
;
but
I
do
not
understand
what
Captain
Tilney
have
be
about
all
this
time
.
<EOS>
why
should
he
pay
her
such
attention
as
to
make
her
quarrel
with
my
brother
,
and
then
fly
off
himself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
very
little
to
say
for
Frederick
's
motive
,
such
as
I
believe
them
to
have
be
.
<EOS>
He
have
his
vanity
as
well
as
Miss
Thorpe
,
and
the
chief
difference
be
,
that
,
have
a
strong
head
,
they
have
not
yet
injure
himself
.
<EOS>
if
the
effect
of
his
behaviour
do
not
justify
him
with
you
,
we
have
well
not
seek
after
the
cause
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
do
not
suppose
he
ever
really
care
about
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
persuade
that
he
never
do
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
only
make
believe
to
do
so
for
mischief
's
sake
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Henry
bow
his
assent
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
I
must
say
that
I
do
not
like
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
though
it
have
turn
out
so
well
for
us
,
I
do
not
like
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
as
it
happen
,
there
be
no
great
harm
do
,
because
I
do
not
think
Isabella
have
any
heart
to
lose
.
<EOS>
but
,
suppose
he
have
make
her
very
much
in
love
with
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
we
must
first
suppose
Isabella
to
have
have
a
heart
to
lose
 
consequently
to
have
be
a
very
different
creature
;
and
,
in
that
case
,
she
would
have
meet
with
very
different
treatment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
right
that
you
should
stand
by
your
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
if
you
would
stand
by
yours
,
you
would
not
be
much
distress
by
the
disappointment
of
Miss
Thorpe
.
<EOS>
but
your
mind
be
warp
by
an
innate
principle
of
general
integrity
,
and
therefore
not
accessible
to
the
cool
reasoning
of
family
partiality
,
or
a
desire
of
revenge
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
be
compliment
out
of
further
bitterness
.
<EOS>
Frederick
could
not
be
unpardonably
guilty
,
while
Henry
make
himself
so
agreeable
.
<EOS>
She
resolve
on
not
answer
Isabella
's
letter
,
and
try
to
think
no
more
of
it
.
    
<EOS>
soon
after
this
,
the
general
find
himself
oblige
to
go
to
London
for
a
week
;
and
he
leave
Northanger
earnestly
regret
that
any
necessity
should
rob
him
even
for
an
hour
of
Miss
Morland
's
company
,
and
anxiously
recommend
the
study
of
her
comfort
and
amusement
to
his
child
as
their
chief
object
in
his
absence
.
<EOS>
His
departure
give
Catherine
the
first
experimental
conviction
that
a
loss
may
be
sometimes
a
gain
.
<EOS>
the
happiness
with
which
their
time
now
pass
,
every
employment
voluntary
,
every
laugh
indulge
<EOS>
,
every
meal
a
scene
of
ease
and
good
humour
,
walk
where
they
like
and
when
they
like
,
their
hour
,
pleasure
,
and
fatigue
at
their
own
command
,
make
her
thoroughly
sensible
of
the
restraint
which
the
general
's
presence
have
impose
,
and
most
thankfully
feel
their
present
release
from
it
.
<EOS>
such
ease
and
such
delight
make
her
love
the
place
and
the
people
more
and
more
every
day
;
and
have
it
not
be
for
a
dread
of
its
soon
become
expedient
to
leave
the
one
,
and
an
apprehension
of
not
be
equally
beloved
by
the
other
,
she
would
at
each
moment
of
each
day
have
be
perfectly
happy
;
but
she
be
now
in
the
fourth
week
of
her
visit
;
before
the
general
come
home
,
the
fourth
week
would
be
turn
,
and
perhaps
it
may
seem
an
intrusion
if
she
stay
much
longer
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
painful
consideration
whenever
it
occur
;
and
eager
to
get
rid
of
such
a
weight
on
her
mind
,
she
very
soon
resolve
to
speak
to
Eleanor
about
it
at
once
,
propose
go
away
,
and
be
guide
in
her
conduct
by
the
manner
in
which
her
proposal
may
be
take
.
  
<EOS>
aware
that
if
she
give
herself
much
time
,
she
may
feel
it
difficult
to
bring
forward
so
unpleasant
a
subject
<EOS>
,
she
take
the
first
opportunity
of
be
suddenly
alone
with
Eleanor
,
and
of
Eleanor
's
be
in
the
middle
of
a
speech
about
something
very
different
,
to
start
forth
her
obligation
of
go
away
very
soon
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
look
and
declare
herself
much
concerned
.
<EOS>
She
have
"
hope
for
the
pleasure
of
her
company
for
a
much
long
time
 
have
be
mislead
(
perhaps
by
her
wish
)
to
suppose
that
a
much
long
visit
have
be
promise
 
and
could
not
but
think
that
if
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Morland
be
aware
of
the
pleasure
it
be
to
her
to
have
her
there
,
they
would
be
too
generous
to
hasten
her
return
.
"
<EOS>
Catherine
explain
:
"
oh
!
<EOS>
as
to
that
,
Papa
and
Mamma
be
in
no
hurry
at
all
.
<EOS>
as
long
as
she
be
happy
,
they
would
always
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
why
,
may
she
ask
,
in
such
a
hurry
herself
to
leave
them
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
because
she
have
be
there
so
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
if
you
can
use
such
a
word
,
I
can
urge
you
no
farther
.
<EOS>
if
you
think
it
long
 
"
  
"
oh
!
<EOS>
no
,
I
do
not
indeed
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
pleasure
,
I
could
stay
with
you
as
long
again
.
"
<EOS>
and
it
be
directly
settle
that
,
till
she
have
,
her
leave
them
be
not
even
to
be
think
of
.
<EOS>
in
have
this
cause
of
uneasiness
so
pleasantly
remove
,
the
force
of
the
other
be
likewise
weaken
.
<EOS>
the
kindness
,
the
earnestness
of
Eleanor
's
manner
in
press
her
to
stay
,
and
Henry
's
gratified
look
on
be
tell
that
her
stay
be
determined
,
be
such
sweet
proof
of
her
importance
with
them
,
as
leave
her
only
just
so
much
solicitude
as
the
human
mind
can
never
do
comfortably
without
.
<EOS>
She
do
 
<EOS>
almost
always
 
believe
that
Henry
love
her
,
and
quite
always
that
his
father
and
sister
love
and
even
wish
her
to
belong
to
them
;
and
believe
so
far
,
her
doubt
and
anxiety
be
merely
sportive
irritation
.
  
<EOS>
Henry
be
not
able
to
obey
his
father
's
injunction
of
remain
wholly
at
Northanger
in
attendance
on
the
lady
,
during
his
absence
in
London
,
the
engagement
of
his
curate
at
Woodston
oblige
him
to
leave
them
on
Saturday
for
a
couple
of
night
.
<EOS>
His
loss
be
not
now
what
it
have
be
while
the
general
be
at
home
;
it
lessen
their
gaiety
,
but
do
not
ruin
their
comfort
;
and
the
two
girl
agree
in
occupation
,
and
improve
in
intimacy
,
find
themselves
so
well
sufficient
for
the
time
to
themselves
,
that
it
be
eleven
o'clock
,
rather
a
late
hour
at
the
abbey
,
before
they
quit
the
supper
-
room
on
the
day
of
Henry
's
departure
.
<EOS>
They
have
just
reach
the
head
of
the
stair
when
it
seem
,
as
far
as
the
thickness
of
the
wall
would
allow
them
to
judge
,
that
a
carriage
be
drive
up
to
the
door
,
and
the
next
moment
confirm
the
idea
by
the
loud
noise
of
the
house
-
bell
.
<EOS>
after
the
first
perturbation
of
surprise
have
pass
away
,
in
a
"
Good
heaven
!
<EOS>
what
can
be
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
it
be
quickly
decide
by
Eleanor
to
be
her
eld
brother
,
whose
arrival
be
often
as
sudden
,
if
not
quite
so
unseasonable
,
and
accordingly
she
hurry
down
to
welcome
him
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
walk
on
to
her
chamber
,
make
up
her
mind
as
well
as
she
could
,
to
a
further
acquaintance
with
Captain
Tilney
,
and
comfort
herself
under
the
unpleasant
impression
his
conduct
have
give
her
,
and
the
persuasion
of
his
being
by
far
too
fine
a
gentleman
to
approve
of
her
,
that
at
least
they
should
not
meet
under
such
circumstance
as
would
make
their
meeting
materially
painful
.
<EOS>
She
trust
he
would
never
speak
of
Miss
Thorpe
;
and
indeed
,
as
he
must
by
this
time
be
ashamed
of
the
part
he
have
act
,
there
could
be
no
danger
of
it
;
and
as
long
as
all
mention
of
Bath
scene
be
avoid
,
she
think
she
could
behave
to
him
very
civilly
.
<EOS>
in
such
consideration
time
pass
away
,
and
it
be
certainly
in
his
favour
that
Eleanor
should
be
so
glad
to
see
him
,
and
have
so
much
to
say
,
for
half
an
hour
be
almost
go
since
his
arrival
,
and
Eleanor
do
not
come
up
.
  
<EOS>
at
that
moment
Catherine
think
she
hear
her
step
in
the
gallery
,
and
listen
for
its
continuance
;
but
all
be
silent
.
<EOS>
scarcely
,
however
,
have
she
convict
her
fancy
of
error
,
when
the
noise
of
something
move
close
to
her
door
make
her
start
;
it
seem
as
if
someone
be
touch
the
very
doorway
 
and
in
another
moment
a
slight
motion
of
the
lock
prove
that
some
hand
must
be
on
it
.
<EOS>
She
tremble
a
little
at
the
idea
of
anyone
's
approach
so
cautiously
;
but
resolve
not
to
be
again
overcome
by
trivial
appearance
of
alarm
,
or
mislead
by
a
raise
imagination
,
she
step
quietly
forward
,
and
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
and
only
Eleanor
,
stand
there
.
<EOS>
Catherine
's
spirit
,
however
,
be
tranquillize
but
for
an
instant
,
for
Eleanor
's
cheek
be
pale
,
and
her
manner
greatly
agitate
.
<EOS>
though
evidently
intend
to
come
in
,
it
seem
an
effort
to
enter
the
room
,
and
a
still
great
to
speak
when
there
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
suppose
some
uneasiness
on
Captain
Tilney
's
account
,
could
only
express
her
concern
by
silent
attention
,
oblige
her
to
be
seat
,
rub
her
temple
with
lavender
-
water
,
and
hang
over
her
with
affectionate
solicitude
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
catherine
,
you
must
not
 
you
must
not
indeed

be
Eleanor
's
first
connected
word
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
quite
well
.
<EOS>
this
kindness
distract
me
 
<EOS>
I
can
not

it

come
to
you
on
such
an
errand

Errand

I

oh
!
<EOS>
how
shall
I
tell
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
a
new
idea
now
dart
into
Catherine
's
mind
,
and
turn
as
pale
as
her
friend
,
she
exclaim
,
"
'
tis
a
messenger
from
Woodston
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
mistaken
,
indeed
,
"
return
Eleanor
,
look
at
her
most
compassionately
;
"
it
be
no
one
from
Woodston
.
<EOS>
It
be
my
father
himself

"
<EOS>
Her
voice
falter
,
and
her
eye
be
turn
to
the
ground
as
she
mention
his
name
.
<EOS>
His
unlooked
-
for
return
be
enough
in
itself
to
make
Catherine
's
heart
sink
,
and
for
a
few
moment
she
hardly
suppose
there
be
anything
bad
to
be
tell
.
<EOS>
She
say
nothing
;
and
Eleanor
,
endeavour
to
collect
herself
and
speak
with
firmness
,
but
with
eye
still
cast
down
,
soon
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
too
good
,
I
be
sure
,
to
think
the
bad
of
me
for
the
part
I
be
oblige
to
perform
.
<EOS>
I
be
indeed
a
most
unwilling
messenger

<EOS>
after
what
have
so
lately
pass
,
so
lately
be
settle
between
us
 
<EOS>
how
joyfully
,
how
thankfully
on
my
side

<EOS>
as
to
your
continuing
here
as
I
hope
for
many
,
many
week
longer
,
how
can
I
tell
you
that
your
kindness
be
not
to
be
accept
 
and
that
the
happiness
your
company
have
hitherto
give
us

to
be
repay

I
must
not
trust
myself
with
word

<EOS>
My
dear
Catherine
,
we
be
to
part
.
<EOS>
My
father
have
recollect
an
engagement
that
take
our
whole
family
away
on
Monday

<EOS>
We
be
go
to
Lord
Longtown

,
near
Hereford
,
for
a
fortnight

<EOS>
explanation
and
apology

equally
impossible

can
not

either

My

cry
Catherine

suppress
her
feeling
as
well
as
she
could

do
not
be
so
distressed

<EOS>
a
second
engagement
must
give
way

a
first

be
very

very
sorry

soon

so
suddenly

can
finish
my
visit
here

at
any

I
hope
you
will
come
to

Eleanor
make
no
answer
;
and
Catherine
's
thought
recur
to
something
more
directly
interesting
,
she
add
,
think
aloud
,
"
<EOS>
Monday
 
so
soon
as
Monday
;
and
you
all
go
.
<EOS>
well
,
I
be
certain
of
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
able
to
take
leave

however

I
need
not
go
till
just
before
you
do

you
know

<EOS>
do
not
be
distress

Eleanor
,
I
can
go
on
Monday
very
well

<EOS>
My
father
and
mother
's
have
no
notice
of
it
be
of
very
little
consequence
.
<EOS>
the
general
will
send
a
servant
with
me
,
I
dare
say
,
half
the
way
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
shall
soon
be
at
Salisbury
,
<EOS>
and
then
I
be
only
nine
mile
from
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
Catherine
!
<EOS>
be
it
settle
so
<EOS>
,
it
would
be
somewhat
less
intolerable
,
though
in
such
common
attention
you
would
have
receive
but
half
what
you
ought

<EOS>
but
 
how
can
I
tell
you
?
 
<EOS>
tomorrow
morning
be
fix
for
your
leave
us
,
and
not
even
the
hour
be
leave
to
your
choice
;
the
very
carriage
be
order
,
and
will
be
here
at
seven
o'clock
,
and
no
servant
will
be
offer
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
sit
down
,
breathless
and
speechless
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
hardly
believe
my
sense
,
when
I
hear
it
;
and
no
displeasure
,
no
resentment
that
you
can
feel
at
this
moment
,
however
justly
great
,
can
be
more
than
I
myself
 
<EOS>
but
I
must
not
talk
of
what
I
feel
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
that
I
could
suggest
anything
in
extenuation
!
<EOS>
good
God
!
<EOS>
what
will
your
father
and
mother
say
!
<EOS>
after
court
you
from
the
protection
of
real
friend
to
this
 
almost
double
distance
from
your
home
,
to
have
you
drive
out
of
the
house
,
without
the
consideration
even
of
decent
civility
!
<EOS>
dear
,
dear
Catherine
,
in
be
the
bearer
of
such
a
message
,
I
seem
guilty
myself
of
all
its
insult
;
yet
,
I
trust
you
will
acquit
me
,
for
you
must
have
be
long
enough
in
this
house
to
see
that
I
be
but
a
nominal
mistress
of
it
,
that
my
real
power
be
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
I
offend
the
general
?
"
say
Catherine
in
a
falter
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
alas
!
<EOS>
for
my
feeling
as
a
daughter
,
all
that
I
know
,
all
that
I
answer
for
,
be
that
you
can
have
give
him
no
just
cause
of
offence
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
be
greatly
,
very
greatly
discomposed
;
I
have
seldom
see
him
more
so
.
<EOS>
His
temper
be
not
happy
,
and
something
have
now
occur
to
ruffle
it
in
an
uncommon
degree
;
some
disappointment
,
some
vexation
,
which
just
at
this
moment
seem
important
,
but
which
I
can
hardly
suppose
you
to
have
any
concern
in
,
for
how
be
it
possible
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
with
pain
that
Catherine
could
speak
at
all
;
and
it
be
only
for
Eleanor
's
sake
that
she
attempt
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
be
very
sorry
if
I
have
offend
him

It
be
the
last
thing
I
would
willingly
have
do

sorry
it

in
Bath

may
go
to
them

comparative
ease

would
take
you
there

a
journey

seventy
mile

"
<EOS>
Eleanor
see
that
she
wish
to
be
alone
;
and
believe
it
better
for
each
that
they
should
avoid
any
further
conversation
,
now
leave
her
with
,
"
I
shall
see
you
in
the
morning

<EOS>
"
  
Catherine
's
swell
heart
need
relief
.
<EOS>
in
Eleanor
's
presence
friendship
and
pride
have
equally
restrain
her
tear
,
but
no
sooner
be
she
go
than
they
burst
forth
in
torrent
.
<EOS>
turn
from
the
house
,
and
in
such
a
way
!
<EOS>
without
any
reason
that
could
justify
,
any
apology
that
could
atone
for
the
abruptness
,
the
rudeness
,
nay
,
the
insolence
of
it
.
<EOS>
Henry
at
a
distance
 
not
able
even
to
bid
him
farewell
.
<EOS>
every
hope
,
every
expectation
from
him
suspend
,
at
least
,
and
who
could
say
how
long
?
<EOS>
who
could
say
when
they
may
meet
again
?
<EOS>
and
all
this
by
such
a
man
as
General
Tilney
,
so
polite
,
so
well
breed
,
and
heretofore
so
particularly
fond
of
her
!
<EOS>
It
be
as
incomprehensible
as
it
be
mortifying
and
grievous
.
<EOS>
from
what
it
could
arise
,
and
where
it
would
end
,
be
consideration
of
equal
perplexity
and
alarm
.
<EOS>
the
manner
in
which
it
be
do
so
grossly
uncivil
,
hurry
her
away
without
any
reference
to
her
own
convenience
,
or
allow
her
even
the
appearance
of
choice
as
to
the
time
or
mode
of
her
travelling
;
of
two
day
,
the
earliest
fix
on
,
and
of
that
almost
the
early
hour
,
as
if
resolve
to
have
her
go
before
he
be
stir
in
the
morning
,
that
he
may
not
be
oblige
even
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
what
could
all
this
mean
but
<EOS>
an
intentional
affront
?
<EOS>
by
some
mean
or
other
she
must
have
have
the
misfortune
to
offend
him
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
have
wish
to
spare
her
from
so
painful
a
notion
,
but
Catherine
could
not
believe
it
possible
that
any
injury
or
any
misfortune
could
provoke
such
ill
will
against
a
person
not
connect
,
or
,
at
least
,
not
suppose
to
be
connect
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
heavily
pass
the
night
.
<EOS>
sleep
,
or
repose
that
deserve
the
name
of
sleep
,
be
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
that
room
,
in
which
her
disturbed
imagination
have
torment
her
on
her
first
arrival
,
be
again
the
scene
of
agitated
spirit
and
unquiet
slumber
.
<EOS>
yet
how
different
now
the
source
of
her
inquietude
from
what
it
have
be
then
 
how
mournfully
superior
in
reality
and
substance
!
<EOS>
Her
anxiety
have
foundation
in
fact
,
her
fear
in
probability
;
and
with
a
mind
so
occupy
in
the
contemplation
of
actual
and
natural
evil
,
the
solitude
of
her
situation
,
the
darkness
of
her
chamber
,
the
antiquity
of
the
building
,
be
feel
and
consider
without
the
small
emotion
;
and
though
the
wind
be
high
,
and
often
produce
strange
and
sudden
noise
throughout
the
house
,
she
hear
it
all
as
she
lie
awake
,
hour
after
hour
,
without
curiosity
or
terror
.
  
<EOS>
soon
after
six
Eleanor
enter
her
room
,
eager
to
show
attention
or
give
assistance
where
it
be
possible
;
but
very
little
remain
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
Catherine
have
not
loiter
;
she
be
almost
dress
,
and
her
pack
almost
finish
.
<EOS>
the
possibility
of
some
conciliatory
message
from
the
general
occur
to
her
as
his
daughter
appear
.
<EOS>
what
so
natural
,
as
that
anger
should
pass
away
and
repentance
succeed
it
?
<EOS>
and
she
only
want
to
know
how
far
,
after
what
have
pass
,
an
apology
may
properly
be
receive
by
her
.
<EOS>
but
the
knowledge
would
have
be
useless
here
;
it
be
not
call
for
;
neither
clemency
nor
dignity
be
put
to
the
trial
 
Eleanor
bring
no
message
.
<EOS>
very
little
pass
between
them
on
meeting
;
each
find
her
great
safety
in
silence
,
and
few
and
trivial
be
the
sentence
exchange
while
they
remain
upstairs
,
Catherine
in
busy
agitation
complete
her
dress
,
and
Eleanor
with
more
goodwill
than
experience
intent
upon
fill
the
trunk
.
<EOS>
when
everything
be
do
they
leave
the
room
,
Catherine
linger
only
half
a
minute
behind
her
friend
to
throw
a
part
glance
on
every
well
-
know
,
cherished
object
,
and
go
down
to
the
breakfast
-
parlour
,
where
breakfast
be
prepare
.
<EOS>
She
try
to
eat
,
as
well
to
save
herself
from
the
pain
of
be
urge
as
to
make
her
friend
comfortable
;
but
she
have
no
appetite
,
and
could
not
swallow
many
mouthful
.
<EOS>
the
contrast
between
this
and
her
last
breakfast
in
that
room
give
her
fresh
misery
,
and
strengthen
her
distaste
for
everything
before
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
four
and
twenty
hour
ago
since
they
have
meet
there
to
the
same
repast
,
but
in
circumstance
how
different
!
<EOS>
with
what
cheerful
ease
,
what
happy
,
though
false
,
security
,
have
she
then
look
around
her
,
enjoy
everything
present
,
and
fear
little
in
future
,
beyond
Henry
's
go
to
Woodston
for
a
day
!
<EOS>
happy
,
happy
breakfast
!
<EOS>
for
Henry
have
be
there
;
Henry
have
sit
by
her
and
help
her
.
<EOS>
these
reflection
be
long
indulge
undisturbed
by
any
address
from
her
companion
,
who
sit
as
deep
in
thought
as
herself
;
and
the
appearance
of
the
carriage
be
the
first
thing
to
startle
and
recall
them
to
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
Catherine
's
colour
rise
at
the
sight
of
it
;
and
the
indignity
with
which
she
be
treat
,
strike
at
that
instant
on
her
mind
with
peculiar
force
,
make
her
for
a
short
time
sensible
only
of
resentment
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
seem
now
impel
into
resolution
and
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
write
to
me
,
Catherine
,
"
she
cry
;
"
you
must
let
me
hear
from
you
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
till
I
know
you
to
be
safe
at
home
,
I
shall
not
have
an
hour
's
comfort
.
<EOS>
for
one
letter
,
at
all
risk
,
all
hazard
,
I
must
entreat
.
<EOS>
let
me
have
the
satisfaction
of
know
that
you
be
safe
at
Fullerton
,
and
have
find
your
family
well
,
and
then
,
till
I
can
ask
for
your
correspondence
as
I
ought
to
do
,
I
will
not
expect
more
.
<EOS>
direct
to
me
at
Lord
Longtown
's
,
and
,
I
must
ask
it
,
under
cover
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Eleanor
,
if
you
be
not
allow
to
receive
a
letter
from
me
,
I
be
sure
I
have
well
not
write
.
<EOS>
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
my
get
home
safe
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
only
reply
,
"
I
can
not
wonder
at
your
feeling
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
importune
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
trust
to
your
own
kindness
of
heart
when
I
be
at
a
distance
from
you
.
"
<EOS>
but
this
,
with
the
look
of
sorrow
accompany
it
,
be
enough
to
melt
Catherine
's
pride
in
a
moment
,
and
she
instantly
say
,
"
oh
,
Eleanor
,
I
will
write
to
you
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
yet
another
point
which
Miss
Tilney
be
anxious
to
settle
,
though
somewhat
embarrassed
in
speak
of
.
<EOS>
It
have
occur
to
her
that
after
so
long
an
absence
from
home
,
Catherine
may
not
be
provide
with
money
enough
for
the
expense
of
her
journey
,
and
,
upon
suggest
it
to
her
with
most
affectionate
offer
of
accommodation
,
it
prove
to
be
exactly
the
case
.
<EOS>
Catherine
have
never
think
on
the
subject
till
that
moment
,
but
,
upon
examine
her
purse
,
be
convince
that
but
for
this
kindness
of
her
friend
,
she
may
have
be
turn
from
the
house
without
even
the
mean
of
get
home
;
and
the
distress
in
which
she
must
have
be
thereby
involve
fill
the
mind
of
both
,
scarcely
another
word
be
say
by
either
during
the
time
of
their
remain
together
.
<EOS>
short
,
however
,
be
that
time
.
<EOS>
the
carriage
be
soon
announce
to
be
ready
;
and
Catherine
,
instantly
rise
,
a
long
and
affectionate
embrace
supply
the
place
of
language
in
bid
each
other
adieu
;
and
,
as
they
enter
the
hall
,
unable
to
leave
the
house
without
some
mention
of
one
whose
name
have
not
yet
be
speak
by
either
<EOS>
,
she
pause
a
moment
,
and
with
quivering
lip
just
make
it
intelligible
that
she
leave
"
her
kind
remembrance
for
her
absent
friend
.
<EOS>
"
but
with
this
approach
to
his
name
end
all
possibility
of
restrain
her
feeling
;
and
,
hide
her
face
as
well
as
she
could
with
her
handkerchief
<EOS>
,
she
dart
across
the
hall
,
jump
into
the
chaise
,
and
in
a
moment
be
drive
from
the
door
.
    
<EOS>
Catherine
be
too
wretched
to
be
fearful
.
<EOS>
the
journey
in
itself
have
no
terror
for
her
;
and
she
begin
it
without
either
dread
its
length
or
feel
its
solitariness
.
<EOS>
lean
back
in
one
corner
of
the
carriage
,
in
a
violent
burst
of
tear
,
she
be
convey
some
mile
beyond
the
wall
of
the
abbey
before
she
raise
her
head
;
and
the
high
point
of
ground
within
the
park
be
almost
closed
from
her
view
before
she
be
capable
of
turn
her
eye
towards
it
.
<EOS>
unfortunately
,
the
road
she
now
travel
be
the
same
which
only
ten
day
ago
she
have
so
happily
pass
along
in
go
to
and
from
Woodston
;
and
,
for
fourteen
mile
,
every
bitter
feeling
be
render
more
severe
by
the
review
of
object
on
which
she
have
first
look
under
impression
so
different
.
<EOS>
every
mile
,
as
it
bring
her
near
Woodston
,
add
to
her
suffering
,
and
when
within
the
distance
of
five
,
she
pass
the
turning
which
lead
to
it
,
and
think
of
Henry
,
so
near
,
yet
so
unconscious
,
her
grief
and
agitation
be
excessive
.
  
<EOS>
the
day
which
she
have
spend
at
that
place
have
be
one
of
the
happy
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
It
be
there
,
it
be
on
that
day
,
that
the
general
have
make
use
of
such
expression
with
regard
to
Henry
and
herself
,
have
so
speak
and
so
look
as
to
give
her
the
most
positive
conviction
of
his
actually
wish
their
marriage
.
<EOS>
yes
,
only
ten
day
ago
have
he
elate
her
by
his
pointed
regard
 
<EOS>
have
he
even
confuse
her
by
his
too
significant
reference
!
<EOS>
and
now
 
what
have
she
do
,
or
what
have
she
omit
to
do
,
to
merit
such
a
change
?
  
<EOS>
the
only
offence
against
him
of
which
she
could
accuse
herself
have
be
such
as
be
scarcely
possible
to
reach
his
knowledge
.
<EOS>
Henry
and
her
own
heart
only
be
privy
to
the
shocking
suspicion
which
she
have
so
idly
entertain
;
and
equally
safe
<EOS>
do
she
believe
her
secret
with
each
.
<EOS>
designedly
,
at
least
,
Henry
could
not
have
betray
her
.
<EOS>
if
,
indeed
,
by
any
strange
mischance
his
father
should
have
gain
intelligence
of
what
she
have
dare
to
think
and
look
for
,
of
her
causeless
fancy
and
injurious
examination
,
she
could
not
wonder
at
any
degree
of
his
indignation
.
<EOS>
if
aware
of
her
have
view
him
as
a
murderer
,
she
could
not
wonder
at
his
even
turn
her
from
his
house
.
<EOS>
but
a
justification
so
full
of
torture
to
herself
,
she
trust
,
would
not
be
in
his
power
.
  
<EOS>
anxious
as
be
all
her
conjecture
on
this
point
,
it
be
not
,
however
,
the
one
on
which
she
dwelt
most
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
thought
yet
near
,
a
more
prevailing
,
more
impetuous
concern
.
<EOS>
how
Henry
would
think
,
and
feel
,
and
look
,
when
he
return
on
the
morrow
to
Northanger
and
hear
of
her
be
go
,
be
a
question
of
force
and
interest
to
rise
over
every
other
,
to
be
never
cease
,
alternately
irritate
and
soothing
;
it
sometimes
suggest
the
dread
of
his
calm
acquiescence
,
and
at
other
be
answer
by
the
sweetest
confidence
in
his
regret
and
resentment
.
<EOS>
to
the
general
,
of
course
,
he
would
not
dare
to
speak
;
but
to
Eleanor
 
<EOS>
what
may
he
not
say
to
Eleanor
about
her
?
  
<EOS>
in
this
unceasing
recurrence
of
doubt
and
inquiry
,
on
any
one
article
of
which
her
mind
be
incapable
of
more
than
momentary
repose
,
the
hour
pass
away
,
and
her
journey
advance
much
faster
than
she
look
for
.
<EOS>
the
press
anxiety
of
thought
,
which
prevent
her
from
notice
anything
before
her
,
when
once
beyond
the
neighbourhood
of
Woodston
,
save
her
at
the
same
time
from
watch
her
progress
;
and
though
no
object
on
the
road
could
engage
a
moment
's
attention
,
she
find
no
stage
of
it
tedious
.
<EOS>
from
this
,
she
be
preserve
too
by
another
cause
,
by
feel
no
eagerness
for
her
journey
's
conclusion
;
for
to
return
in
such
a
manner
to
Fullerton
be
almost
to
destroy
the
pleasure
of
a
meeting
with
those
she
love
best
,
even
after
an
absence
such
as
her
 
an
eleven
week
'
absence
.
<EOS>
what
have
she
to
say
that
would
not
humble
herself
and
pain
her
family
,
that
would
not
increase
her
own
grief
by
the
confession
of
it
,
extend
an
useless
resentment
,
and
perhaps
involve
the
innocent
with
the
guilty
in
undistinguishe
ill
will
?
<EOS>
She
could
never
do
justice
to
Henry
and
Eleanor
's
merit
;
she
feel
it
too
strongly
for
expression
;
and
should
a
dislike
be
take
against
them
,
should
they
be
think
of
unfavourably
,
on
their
father
's
account
,
it
would
cut
her
to
the
heart
.
  
<EOS>
with
these
feeling
,
she
rather
dread
than
seek
for
the
first
view
of
that
well
-
know
spire
which
would
announce
her
within
twenty
mile
of
home
.
<EOS>
Salisbury
she
have
know
to
be
her
point
on
leave
Northanger
;
but
after
the
first
stage
she
have
be
indebte
to
the
post
-
master
for
the
name
of
the
place
which
be
then
to
conduct
her
to
it
;
so
great
have
be
her
ignorance
of
her
route
.
<EOS>
She
meet
with
nothing
,
however
,
to
distress
or
frighten
her
.
<EOS>
Her
youth
,
civil
manner
,
and
liberal
pay
procure
her
all
the
attention
that
a
traveller
like
herself
could
require
;
and
stop
only
to
change
horse
,
she
travel
on
for
about
eleven
hour
without
accident
or
alarm
,
and
between
six
and
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
find
herself
enter
Fullerton
.
  
<EOS>
a
heroine
return
,
at
the
close
of
her
career
,
to
her
native
village
,
in
all
the
triumph
of
recover
reputation
,
and
all
the
dignity
of
a
countess
,
with
a
long
train
of
noble
relation
in
their
several
phaeton
,
and
three
waiting
-
maid
in
a
travel
chaise
and
four
,
behind
her
,
be
an
event
on
which
the
pen
of
the
contriver
may
well
delight
to
dwell
;
it
give
credit
to
every
conclusion
,
and
the
author
must
share
in
the
glory
she
so
liberally
bestow
.
<EOS>
but
my
affair
be
widely
different
;
I
bring
back
my
heroine
to
her
home
in
solitude
and
disgrace
;
and
no
sweet
elation
of
spirit
can
lead
me
into
minuteness
.
<EOS>
a
heroine
in
a
hack
post
-
chaise
be
such
a
blow
upon
sentiment
,
as
no
attempt
at
grandeur
or
pathos
can
withstand
.
<EOS>
swiftly
therefore
shall
her
post
-
boy
drive
through
the
village
,
amid
the
gaze
of
Sunday
group
,
and
speedy
shall
be
her
descent
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
whatever
may
be
the
distress
of
Catherine
's
mind
,
as
she
thus
advance
towards
the
parsonage
,
and
whatever
the
humiliation
of
her
biographer
in
relate
it
,
she
be
prepare
enjoyment
of
no
everyday
nature
for
those
to
whom
she
go
;
first
,
in
the
appearance
of
her
carriage
 
and
secondly
,
in
herself
.
<EOS>
the
chaise
of
a
traveller
be
a
rare
sight
in
Fullerton
,
the
whole
family
be
immediately
at
the
window
;
and
to
have
it
stop
at
the
sweep
-
gate
be
a
pleasure
to
brighten
every
eye
and
occupy
every
fancy
 
a
pleasure
quite
unlooked
for
by
all
but
the
two
young
child
,
a
boy
and
girl
of
six
and
four
year
old
,
who
expect
a
brother
or
sister
in
every
carriage
.
<EOS>
happy
the
glance
that
first
distinguish
Catherine
!
<EOS>
happy
the
voice
that
proclaim
the
discovery
!
<EOS>
but
whether
such
happiness
be
the
lawful
property
of
George
or
Harriet
could
never
be
exactly
understand
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
,
mother
,
Sarah
,
George
,
and
Harriet
,
all
assemble
at
the
door
to
welcome
her
with
affectionate
eagerness
,
be
a
sight
to
awaken
the
good
feeling
of
Catherine
's
heart
;
and
in
the
embrace
of
each
,
as
she
step
from
the
carriage
,
she
find
herself
soothe
beyond
anything
that
she
have
believe
possible
.
<EOS>
so
surround
,
so
caressed
,
she
be
even
happy
!
<EOS>
in
the
joyfulness
of
family
love
everything
for
a
short
time
be
subdue
,
and
the
pleasure
of
see
her
,
leave
them
at
first
little
leisure
for
calm
curiosity
,
they
be
all
seat
round
the
tea
-
table
,
which
Mrs.
Morland
have
hurry
for
the
comfort
of
the
poor
traveller
,
<EOS>
whose
pale
and
jade
look
soon
catch
her
notice
,
before
any
inquiry
so
direct
as
to
demand
a
positive
answer
be
address
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
reluctantly
,
and
with
much
hesitation
,
do
she
then
begin
what
may
perhaps
,
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
,
be
term
,
by
the
courtesy
of
her
hearer
,
an
explanation
;
but
scarcely
,
within
that
time
,
could
they
at
all
discover
the
cause
,
or
collect
the
particular
,
of
her
sudden
return
.
<EOS>
They
be
far
from
be
an
irritable
race
;
far
from
any
quickness
in
catching
,
or
bitterness
in
resenting
,
affront
:
but
here
,
when
the
whole
be
unfold
,
be
an
insult
not
to
be
overlook
,
nor
,
for
the
first
half
hour
,
to
be
easily
pardon
.
<EOS>
without
suffer
any
romantic
alarm
,
in
the
consideration
of
their
daughter
's
long
and
lonely
journey
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Morland
could
not
but
feel
that
it
may
have
be
productive
of
much
unpleasantness
to
her
;
that
it
be
what
they
could
never
have
voluntarily
suffer
;
and
that
,
in
force
her
on
such
a
measure
,
General
Tilney
have
act
neither
honourably
nor
feelingly
 
neither
as
a
gentleman
nor
as
a
parent
.
<EOS>
why
he
have
do
it
,
what
could
have
provoke
him
to
such
a
breach
of
hospitality
,
and
so
suddenly
turn
all
his
partial
regard
for
their
daughter
into
actual
ill
will
,
be
a
matter
which
they
be
at
least
as
far
from
divine
as
Catherine
herself
;
but
it
do
not
oppress
them
by
any
mean
so
long
;
and
,
after
a
due
course
of
useless
conjecture
,
that
"
it
be
a
strange
business
,
and
that
he
must
be
a
very
strange
man
,
"
grow
enough
for
all
their
indignation
and
wonder
;
though
Sarah
indeed
still
indulge
in
the
sweet
of
incomprehensibility
,
exclaim
and
conjecture
with
youthful
ardour
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
you
give
yourself
a
great
deal
of
needless
trouble
,
"
say
her
mother
at
last
;
"
depend
upon
it

<EOS>
it
be
something
not
at
all
worth
understand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
allow
for
his
wish
Catherine
away
,
when
he
recollect
this
engagement
,
"
say
Sarah
,
"
but
why
not
do
it
civilly
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
for
the
young
people
,
"
return
Mrs.
Morland
;
"
they
must
have
a
sad
time
of
it

but
as
for
anything
else
,
it
be
no
matter
now
;
Catherine
be
safe
at
home
,
and
our
comfort
do
not
depend
upon
General
Tilney

"
<EOS>
Catherine
sigh
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
"
continue
her
philosophic
mother
,
"
I
be
glad
I
do
not
know
of
your
journey
at
the
time
;
but
now
it
be
all
over

perhaps
there
be
no
great
harm
do
.
<EOS>
It
be
always
good
for
young
people
to
be
put
upon
exert
themselves
;
and
you
know
,
my
dear
Catherine
,
you
always
be
a
sad
little
scatter

brain
creature
;
but
now
you
must
have
be
force
to
have
your
wit
about
you
,
with
so
much
change
of
chaise
and
so
forth
;
and
I
hope
it
will
appear
that
you
have
not
leave
anything
behind
you
in
any
of
the
pocket
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
hope
so
too
,
and
try
to
feel
an
interest
in
her
own
amendment
,
but
her
spirit
be
quite
wear
down
;
and
,
to
be
silent
and
alone
become
soon
<EOS>
her
only
wish
<EOS>
,
she
readily
agree
to
her
mother
's
next
counsel
of
go
early
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Her
parent
,
see
nothing
in
her
ill
look
and
agitation
but
the
natural
consequence
of
mortified
feeling
,
and
of
the
unusual
exertion
and
fatigue
of
such
a
journey
,
part
from
her
without
any
doubt
of
their
being
soon
sleep
away
;
and
though
,
when
they
all
meet
the
next
morning
,
her
recovery
be
not
equal
to
their
hope
,
they
be
still
perfectly
unsuspicious
of
there
be
any
deep
evil
.
<EOS>
They
never
once
think
of
her
heart
,
which
,
for
the
parent
of
a
young
lady
of
seventeen
,
just
return
from
her
first
excursion
from
home
,
be
odd
enough
!
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
breakfast
be
over
,
she
sit
down
to
fulfil
her
promise
to
Miss
Tilney
,
whose
trust
in
the
effect
of
time
and
distance
on
her
friend
's
disposition
be
already
justify

for
already
do
Catherine
reproach
herself
with
have
part
from
Eleanor
coldly
,
with
have
never
enough
value
her
merit
or
kindness
,
and
never
enough
commiserate
her
for
what
she
have
be
yesterday
leave
to
endure
.
<EOS>
the
strength
of
these
feeling
,
however
,
be
far
from
assist
her
pen
;
and
never
have
it
be
hard
for
her
to
write
than
in
address
Eleanor
Tilney
.
<EOS>
to
compose
a
letter
which
may
at
once
do
justice
to
her
sentiment
and
her
situation
,
convey
gratitude
without
servile
regret
,
be
guard
without
coldness
,
and
honest
without
resentment
 
<EOS>
a
letter
which
Eleanor
may
not
be
pain
by
the
perusal
of
 
and
,
above
all
,
which
she
may
not
blush
herself
,
if
Henry
should
chance
to
see
,
be
an
undertaking
to
frighten
away
all
her
power
of
performance
;

,
after
long
thought

much
perplexity

to
be
very
brief

all

on

<EOS>
the
money
therefore
which
Eleanor
have
advance

enclose
with
little
more

the
thousand
good

I
be
sorry
it

so

Mrs.

think
them
very
pretty
kind

young

you
be
sadly
out

<EOS>
Poor
James

<EOS>
well
,
we
must
live

the
next
new

will
be
better

Eleanor

"
if
so
,
my

I
dare
say
you
will
meet
again
some
time

other

do
not
be
uneasy
.
<EOS>
It
be
ten
to
one
but
you
be
throw
together
again
in
the
course
of
a
few
year
;
and
then
what
a
pleasure
it
will
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Morland
be
not
happy
in
her
attempt
at
consolation
.
<EOS>
the
hope
of
meet
again
in
the
course
of
a
few
year
could
only
put
into
Catherine
's
head
what
may
happen
within
that
time
to
make
a
meeting
dreadful
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
never
forget
Henry
Tilney
,
or
think
of
him
with
less
tenderness
than
she
do
at
that
moment
;
but
he
may
forget
her
;
and
in
that
case
,
to
meet
 
!
<EOS>
Her
eye
fill
with
tear
as
she
picture
her
acquaintance
so
renew
;
and
her
mother
,
perceive
her
comfortable
suggestion
to
have
have
no
good
effect
,
propose
,
as
another
expedient
for
restore
her
spirit
,
that
they
should
call
on
Mrs.
Allen
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
house
be
only
a
quarter
of
a
mile
apart
;
and
,
as
they
walk
,
Mrs.
Morland
quickly
dispatch
all
that
she
feel
on
the
score
of
James
's
disappointment
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
sorry
for
him
,
"
say
she
;
"
but
otherwise
there
be
no
harm
do
in
the
match
go
off
;
for
it
could
not
be
a
desirable
thing
to
have
him
engage
to
a
girl
whom
we
have
not
the
small
acquaintance
with
,
and
who
be
so
entirely
without
fortune
;
and
now
,
after
such
behaviour
,
we
can
not
think
at
all
well
of
her
.
<EOS>
just
at
present
it
come
hard
to
poor
James
;
but
that
will
not
last
forever
;
and
I
dare
say
he
will
be
a
discreeter
man
all
his
life
,
for
the
foolishness
of
his
first
choice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
just
such
a
summary
view
of
the
affair
as
Catherine
could
listen
to
;
another
sentence
may
have
endanger
her
complaisance
,
and
make
her
reply
less
rational
;
for
soon
be
all
her
thinking
power
swallow
up
in
the
reflection
of
her
own
change
of
feeling
and
spirit
since
last
she
have
trodden
that
well
-
know
road
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
three
month
ago
since
,
wild
with
joyful
expectation
<EOS>
,
she
have
there
run
backwards
and
forwards
some
ten
time
a
day
,
with
an
heart
light
,
gay
,
and
independent
;
look
forward
to
pleasure
untaste
and
unalloyed
,
and
free
from
the
apprehension
of
evil
as
from
the
knowledge
of
it
.
<EOS>
three
month
ago
have
see
her
all
this
;
and
now
,
how
alter
a
being
<EOS>
do
she
return
!
  
<EOS>
She
be
receive
by
the
Allens
with
all
the
kindness
which
her
unlooked
-
for
appearance
,
act
on
a
steady
affection
,
would
naturally
call
forth
;
and
great
be
their
surprise
,
and
warm
their
displeasure
,
on
hear
how
she
have
be
treat
 
though
Mrs.
Morland
's
account
of
it
be
no
inflated
representation
,
no
study
appeal
to
their
passion

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Catherine
take
us
quite
by
surprise
yesterday
evening

she

"
<EOS>
She
travel
all
the

by
herself

nothing

Saturday
night

for
General
Tilney

from
some
odd
fancy
or
other

all
of
a
sudden
grow
tired
of
have
her
there
,
and
almost
turn
her
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
very
unfriendly
,
certainly
;
and
he
must
be
a
very
odd
man
;
but
we
be
so
glad
to
have
her
amongst
us
again
!
<EOS>
and
it
be
a
great
comfort
to
find
that
she
be
not
a
poor
helpless
creature
,
but
can
shift
very
well
for
herself

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Allen
express
himself
on
the
occasion
with
the
reasonable
resentment
of
a
sensible
friend

and
Mrs.
Allen
think
his
expression
quite
good
enough
to
be
immediately
make
use
of
again
by
herself

<EOS>
His
wonder
,
his
conjecture

and
his
explanation
become
in
succession
her
,
with
the
addition
of
this
single
remark
 
<EOS>
"
I
really
have
not
patience
with

it
you
some
day
or
other

<EOS>
Bath
be
a
nice
place
,
Catherine
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
I
do
not
above
half
like
come
away
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Thorpe
's
be
there
be
such
a
comfort
to
us
,
be
not
it
?
<EOS>
You
know
,
you
and
I
be
quite
forlorn
at
first
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
but
that
do
not
last
long
,
"
say
Catherine
,
her
eye
brighten
at
the
recollection
of
what
have
first
give
spirit
to
her
existence
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
true
:
we
soon
meet
with
Mrs.
Thorpe
,
and
then
we
want
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
My
dear
,
do
not
you
think
these
silk
glove
wear
very
well
?
<EOS>
I
put
them
on
new
the
first
time
of
our
go
to
the
Lower
Rooms
,
you
know
,
and
I
have
wear
them
a
great
deal
since
.
<EOS>
do
you
remember
that
evening
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
I
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
perfectly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
agreeable
,
be
not
it
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Tilney
drink
tea
with
us
,
and
I
always
think
him
a
great
addition
,
he
be
so
very
agreeable
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
notion
you
dance
with
him
,
but
be
not
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
I
remember
I
have
my
favourite
gown
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
could
not
answer
;
and
,
after
a
short
trial
of
other
subject
,
Mrs.
Allen
again
return
to
 
"
I
really
have
not
patience
with
the
general
!
<EOS>
such
an
agreeable
,
worthy
man
as
he
seem
to
be
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
,
Mrs.
Morland
,
you
ever
see
a
better
-
breed
man
in
your
life
.
<EOS>
His
lodging
be
take
the
very
day
after
he
leave
them
,
Catherine
.
<EOS>
but
no
wonder
;
Milsom
Street
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
they
walk
home
again
,
Mrs.
Morland
endeavour
to
impress
on
her
daughter
's
mind
the
happiness
of
have
such
steady
well
-
wisher
as
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Allen
,
and
the
very
little
consideration
which
the
neglect
or
unkindness
of
slight
acquaintance
like
the
Tilneys
ought
to
have
with
her
,
while
she
could
preserve
the
good
opinion
and
affection
of
her
early
friend
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
deal
of
good
sense
in
all
this
;
but
there
be
some
situation
of
the
human
mind
in
which
good
sense
have
very
little
power
;
and
Catherine
's
feeling
contradict
almost
every
position
her
mother
advance
.
<EOS>
It
be
upon
the
behaviour
of
these
very
slight
acquaintance
that
all
her
present
happiness
depend
;
and
while
Mrs.
Morland
be
successfully
confirm
her
own
opinion
by
the
justness
of
her
own
representation
,
Catherine
be
silently
reflect
that
now
Henry
must
have
arrive
at
Northanger
;
now
he
must
have
hear
of
her
departure
;
and
now
,
perhaps
,
they
be
all
set
off
for
Hereford
.
    
<EOS>
Catherine
's
disposition
be
not
naturally
sedentary
,
nor
have
her
habit
be
ever
very
industrious
;
but
whatever
may
hitherto
have
be
her
defect
of
that
sort
,
<EOS>
her
mother
could
not
but
perceive
them
now
to
be
greatly
increase
.
<EOS>
She
could
neither
sit
still
nor
employ
herself
for
ten
minute
together
,
walk
round
the
garden
and
orchard
again
and
again
,
as
if
nothing
but
motion
be
voluntary
;
and
it
seem
as
if
she
could
even
walk
about
the
house
rather
than
remain
fix
for
any
time
in
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
Her
loss
of
spirit
be
a
yet
great
alteration
.
<EOS>
in
her
rambling
and
her
idleness
she
may
only
be
a
caricature
of
herself
;
but
in
her
silence
and
sadness
she
be
the
very
reverse
of
all
that
she
have
be
before
.
  
<EOS>
for
two
day
Mrs.
Morland
allow
it
to
pass
even
without
a
hint
;
but
when
a
third
night
's
rest
have
neither
restore
her
cheerfulness
,
improve
her
in
useful
activity
,
nor
give
her
a
great
inclination
for
needlework
,
she
could
no
longer
refrain
from
the
gentle
reproof
of
,
"
My
dear
catherine
,
I
be
afraid
you
be
grow
quite
a
fine
lady

<EOS>
I
do
not
know
when
poor
Richard
's
cravat
would
be
do
,
if
he
have
no
friend
but
you
.
<EOS>
Your
head
run
too
much
upon
Bath
;
but
there
be
a
time
for
everything
 
a
time
for
ball
and
play
,
and
a
time
for
work
.
<EOS>
You
have
have
a
long
run
of
amusement
,
and
now
you
must
try
to
be
useful
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
take
up
her
work
directly
,
say
,
in
a
dejected
voice
,
that
"
her
head
do
not
run
upon
Bath
 
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
be
fret
about
General
Tilney
,
and
that
be
very
simple
of
you

for
ten
to
one
whether
you
ever
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
You
should
never
fret
about
trifle

<EOS>
"
after
a
short
silence
 
"
I
hope
,
my
Catherine
,
you
be
not
get
out
of
humour
with
home
because
it
be
not
so
grand
as
Northanger
.
<EOS>
that
would
be
turn
your
visit
into
an
evil
indeed
.
<EOS>
wherever
you
be
you
should
always
be
content
,
but
especially
at
home
,
because
there
you
must
spend
the
most
of
your
time
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
quite
like
,
at
breakfast
,
to
hear
you
talk
so
much
about
the
french
bread
at
Northanger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
do
not
care
about
the
bread
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
the
same
to
me
what
I
eat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
very
clever
essay
in
one
of
the
book
upstairs
upon
much
such
a
subject
,
about
young
girl
that
have
be
spoilt
for
home
by
great
acquaintance
 
<EOS>
the
Mirror

I
think
.
<EOS>
I
will
look
it
out
for
you
some
day
or
other
,
because
I
be
sure
it
will
do
you
good
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
say
no
more
,
and
,
with
an
endeavour
to
do
right
,
apply
to
her
work
;
but
,
after
a
few
minute
,
sink
again
,
without
know
it
herself
,
into
languor
and
listlessness
,
move
herself
in
her
chair
,
from
the
irritation
of
weariness
,
much
oftener
than
she
move
her
needle
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Morland
watch
the
progress
of
this
relapse
;
and
see
,
in
her
daughter
's
absent
and
dissatisfied
look
,
the
full
proof
of
that
repine
spirit
to
which
she
have
now
begin
to
attribute
her
want
of
cheerfulness
,
hastily
leave
the
room
to
fetch
the
book
in
question
,
anxious
to
lose
no
time
in
attack
so
dreadful
a
malady
.
<EOS>
It
be
some
time
before
she
could
find
what
she
look
for
;
and
other
family
matter
occur
to
detain
her
,
<EOS>
a
quarter
of
an
hour
have
elapse
ere
<EOS>
she
return
downstairs
with
the
volume
from
which
so
much
be
hope
.
<EOS>
Her
avocation
above
have
shut
out
all
noise
but
<EOS>
what
she
create
herself
,
she
know
not
that
a
visitor
have
arrive
within
the
last
few
minute
,
till
,
on
enter
the
room
,
the
first
object
she
beheld
be
a
young
man
whom
she
have
never
see
before
.
<EOS>
with
a
look
of
much
respect
,
he
immediately
rise
,
and
be
introduce
to
her
by
her
conscious
daughter
as
"
Mr.
Henry
Tilney
,
"
with
the
embarrassment
of
real
sensibility
begin
to
apologize
for
his
appearance
there
,
acknowledge
that
after
what
have
pass
he
have
little
right
to
expect
a
welcome
at
Fullerton
,
and
state
his
impatience
to
be
assure
of
Miss
Morland
's
have
reach
her
home
in
safety
,
as
the
cause
of
his
intrusion
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
address
himself
to
an
uncandid
judge
or
a
resentful
heart
.
<EOS>
far
from
comprehend
him
or
his
sister
in
their
father
's
misconduct
,
Mrs.
Morland
have
be
always
kindly
disposed
towards
each
,
and
instantly
,
please
by
his
appearance
,
receive
him
with
the
simple
profession
of
unaffected
benevolence
;
thank
him
for
such
an
attention
to
her
daughter
,
assure
him
that
the
friend
of
her
child
be
always
welcome
there
,
and
entreat
him
to
say
not
another
word
of
the
past
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
not
ill
-
inclined
to
obey
this
request
,
for
,
though
his
heart
be
greatly
relieve
by
such
unlooked
-
for
mildness
,
it
be
not
just
at
that
moment
in
his
power
to
say
anything
to
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
return
in
silence
to
his
seat
,
therefore
,
he
remain
for
some
minute
most
civilly
answer
all
Mrs.
Morland
's
common
remark
about
the
weather
and
road
.
<EOS>
Catherine
meanwhile
 
the
anxious
,
agitate
,
happy
,
feverish
Catherine
 
say
not
a
word
;
but
her
glow
cheek
and
brighten
eye
make
her
mother
trust
that
this
good
-
natured
visit
would
at
least
set
her
heart
at
ease
for
a
time
,
and
gladly
therefore
do
she
lie
aside
the
first
volume
of
the
Mirror
for
a
future
hour
.
  
<EOS>
desirous
of
Mr.
Morland
's
assistance
,
as
well
in
give
encouragement
,
as
in
find
conversation
for
her
guest
,
whose
embarrassment
on
his
father
's
account
she
earnestly
pity
,
Mrs.
Morland
have
very
early
dispatch
one
of
the
child
to
summon
him
;
but
Mr.
Morland
be
from
home
 
and
be
thus
without
any
support
,
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
have
nothing
to
say
.
<EOS>
after
a
couple
of
minute
'
unbroken
silence
,
Henry
,
turn
to
Catherine
for
the
first
time
since
her
mother
's
entrance
,
ask
her
,
with
sudden
alacrity
,
if
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Allen
be
now
at
Fullerton
?
<EOS>
and
on
develop
,
from
amidst
all
her
perplexity
of
word
in
reply
,
the
meaning
,
which
one
short
syllable
would
have
give
,
immediately
express
his
intention
of
pay
his
respect
to
them
,
and
,
with
a
rise
colour
,
ask
her
if
she
would
have
the
goodness
to
show
him
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
see
the
house
from
this
window
,
sir
,
"
be
information
on
Sarah
's
side
,
which
produce
only
a
bow
of
acknowledgment
from
the
gentleman
,
and
a
silencing
nod
from
her
mother
;
for
Mrs.
Morland
,
think
it
probable
,
as
a
secondary
consideration
in
his
wish
of
wait
on
their
worthy
neighbour
,
that
he
may
have
some
explanation
to
give
of
his
father
's
behaviour
,
which
it
must
be
more
pleasant
for
him
to
communicate
only
to
Catherine
,
would
not
on
any
account
prevent
her
accompany
him
.
<EOS>
They
begin
their
walk
,
and
Mrs.
Morland
be
not
entirely
mistaken
in
his
object
in
wish
it
.
<EOS>
some
explanation
on
his
father
's
account
he
have
to
give
;
but
his
first
purpose
be
to
explain
himself
,
and
before
they
reach
Mr.
Allen
's
ground
he
have
do
it
so
well
that
Catherine
do
not
think
it
could
ever
be
repeat
too
often
.
<EOS>
She
be
assure
of
his
affection
;
and
that
heart
in
return
be
solicit
,
which
,
perhaps
,
they
pretty
equally
know
be
already
entirely
his
own
;
for
,
though
Henry
be
now
sincerely
attach
to
her
,
though
he
feel
and
delighted
in
all
the
excellency
of
her
character
and
truly
love
her
society
,
I
must
confess
that
his
affection
originate
in
nothing
well
than
gratitude
,
or
,
in
other
word
,
that
a
persuasion
of
her
partiality
for
him
have
be
the
only
cause
of
give
her
a
serious
thought
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
new
circumstance
in
romance
,
I
acknowledge
,
and
dreadfully
derogatory
of
an
heroine
's
dignity
;
but
if
it
be
as
new
in
common
life
,
the
credit
of
a
wild
imagination
will
at
least
be
all
my
own
.
  
<EOS>
a
very
short
visit
to
Mrs.
Allen
,
in
which
Henry
talk
at
random
,
without
sense
or
connection
,
and
Catherine
,
rapt
in
the
contemplation
of
her
own
unutterable
happiness
,
scarcely
open
her
lip
,
dismiss
them
to
the
ecstasy
of
another
tete
-
a
-
tete
;
and
before
it
be
suffer
to
close
,
she
be
enable
to
judge
how
far
he
be
sanction
by
parental
authority
in
his
present
application
.
<EOS>
on
his
return
from
Woodston
,
two
day
before
,
he
have
be
meet
near
the
abbey
by
his
impatient
father
,
hastily
inform
in
angry
term
of
Miss
Morland
's
departure
,
and
order
to
think
of
her
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
permission
upon
which
he
have
now
offer
her
his
hand
.
<EOS>
the
affrighted
Catherine
,
amidst
all
the
terror
of
expectation
,
as
she
listen
to
this
account
,
could
not
but
rejoice
in
the
kind
caution
with
which
Henry
have
save
her
from
the
necessity
of
a
conscientious
rejection
,
by
engage
her
faith
before
he
mention
the
subject
;
and
as
he
proceed
to
give
the
particular
,
and
explain
the
motive
of
his
father
's
conduct
,
her
feeling
soon
harden
into
even
a
triumphant
delight
.
<EOS>
the
general
have
have
nothing
to
accuse
her
of
,
nothing
to
lay
to
her
charge
,
but
her
be
the
involuntary
,
unconscious
object
of
a
deception
which
his
pride
could
not
pardon
,
and
which
a
well
pride
would
have
be
ashamed
to
own
.
<EOS>
She
be
guilty
only
of
be
less
rich
than
he
have
suppose
her
to
be
.
<EOS>
under
a
mistaken
persuasion
of
her
possession
and
claim
,
he
have
court
her
acquaintance
in
Bath
,
solicit
her
company
at
Northanger
,
and
design
her
for
his
daughter
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
on
discover
his
error
,
to
turn
her
from
the
house
<EOS>
seem
the
good
,
though
to
his
feeling
an
inadequate
proof
of
his
resentment
towards
herself
,
and
his
contempt
of
her
family
.
  
<EOS>
John
Thorpe
have
first
mislead
him
.
<EOS>
the
general
,
perceive
his
son
one
night
at
the
theatre
to
be
pay
considerable
attention
to
Miss
Morland
,
have
accidentally
inquire
of
Thorpe
if
he
know
more
of
her
than
her
name
.
<EOS>
Thorpe
,
most
happy
to
be
on
speak
term
with
a
man
of
General
Tilney
's
importance
,
have
be
joyfully
and
proudly
communicative
;
and
be
at
that
time
not
only
in
daily
expectation
of
Morland
's
engage
Isabella
,
but
likewise
pretty
well
resolve
upon
marry
Catherine
himself
,
his
vanity
induce
him
to
represent
the
family
as
yet
more
wealthy
than
his
vanity
and
avarice
have
make
him
believe
them
.
<EOS>
with
whomsoever
he
be
,
or
be
likely
to
be
connect
,
his
own
consequence
always
require
that
theirs
should
be
great
,
and
as
his
intimacy
with
any
acquaintance
grow
,
so
regularly
grow
their
fortune
.
<EOS>
the
expectation
of
his
friend
Morland
,
therefore
,
from
the
first
overrate
,
have

since
his
introduction
to
Isabella
be
gradually
increase
;
and
by
merely
add
twice
as
much
for
the
grandeur
of
the
moment
,
by
double
what
he
choose
to
think
the
amount
of
Mr.
Morland
's
preferment
,
treble
his
private
fortune
,
bestow
a
rich
aunt
,
and
sink
half
the
child
,
he
be
able
to
represent
the
whole
family
to
the
general
in
a
most
respectable
light
.
<EOS>
for
Catherine
,
however
,
the
peculiar
object
of
the
general
's
curiosity
,
and
his
own
speculation
,
he
have
yet
something
more
in
reserve
,
and
the
ten
or
fifteen
thousand
pound
which
her
father
could
give
her
would
be
a
pretty
addition
to
Mr.
Allen
's
estate
.
<EOS>
Her
intimacy
there
have
make
him
seriously
determine
on
her
be
handsomely
legacie
hereafter
;
and
to
speak
of
her
therefore
as
the
almost
acknowledge
future
heiress
of
Fullerton
naturally
follow
.
<EOS>
upon
such
intelligence
the
general
have
proceed
;
for
never
have
it
occur
to
him
to
doubt
its
authority
.
<EOS>
Thorpe
's
interest
in
the
family
,
by
his
sister
's
approach
connection
with
one
of
its
member
,
and
his
own
view
on
another
(
circumstance
of
which
he
boast
with
almost
equal
openness
)
,
seem
sufficient
voucher
for
his
truth
;
and
to
these
be
add
the
absolute
fact
of
the
Allens
be
wealthy
and
childless
,
of
Miss
Morland
's
be
under
their
care
,
and
 
as
soon
as
his
acquaintance
allow
him
to
judge
 
of
their
treat
her
with
parental
kindness
.
<EOS>
His
resolution
be
soon
form
.
<EOS>
already
have
he
discern
a
liking
towards
Miss
Morland
in
the
countenance
of
his
son
;
and
thankful
for
Mr.
Thorpe
's
communication
,
he
almost
instantly
determine
to
spare
no
pain
in
weaken
his
boasted
interest
and
ruin
his
dear
hope
.
<EOS>
Catherine
herself
could
not
be
more
ignorant
at
the
time
of
all
this
,
than
his
own
child
.
<EOS>
Henry
and
Eleanor
,
perceive
nothing
in
her
situation
likely
to
engage
their
father
's
particular
respect
,
have
see
with
astonishment
the
suddenness
,
continuance
,
and
extent
of
his
attention
;
and
though
latterly
,
from
some
hint
which
have
accompany
an
almost
positive
command
to
his
son
of
do
everything
in
his
power
to
attach
her
,
Henry
be
convince
of
his
father
's
believe
it
to
be
an
advantageous
connection
,
it
be
not
till
the
late
explanation
at
Northanger
that
they
have
the
small
idea
of
the
false
calculation
which
have
hurry
him
on
.
<EOS>
that
they
be
false
,
the
general
have
learn
from
the
very
person
who
have
suggest
them
,
from
Thorpe
himself
,
whom
he
have
chance
to
meet
again
in
town
,
and
who
,
under
the
influence
of
exactly
opposite
feeling
,
irritate
by
Catherine
's
refusal
,
and
yet
more
by
the
failure
of
a
very
recent
endeavour
to
accomplish
a
reconciliation
between
Morland
and
Isabella
,
convince
that
they
be
separate
forever
,
and
spurn
a
friendship
which
could
be
no
longer
serviceable
,
hasten
to
contradict
all
that
he
have
say
before
to
the
advantage
of
the
morland
 
confess
himself
to
have
be
totally
mistake
in
his
opinion
of
their
circumstance
and
character
,
mislead
by
the
rhodomontade
of
his
friend
to
believe
his
father
a
man
of
substance
and
credit
,
whereas
the
transaction
of
the
two
or
three
last
week
prove
him
to
be
neither
;
for
after
come
eagerly
forward
on
the
first
overture
of
a
marriage
between
the
family
,
with
the
most
liberal
proposal
,
he
have
,
on
be
bring
to
the
point
by
the
shrewdness
of
the
relator
,
be
constrain
to
acknowledge
himself
incapable
of
give
the
young
people
even
a
decent
support
.
<EOS>
They
be
,
in
fact
,
a
necessitous
family
;
numerous
,
too
,
almost
beyond
example
;
by
no
means
respect
in
their
own
neighbourhood
,
as
he
have
lately
have
particular
opportunity
of
discover
;
aim
at
a
style
of
life
which
their
fortune
could
not
warrant
;
seek
to
better
themselves
by
wealthy
connection
;
a
forward
,
bragging
,
scheme
race
.
  
<EOS>
the
terrified
general
pronounce
the
name
of
Allen
with
an
inquiring
look
;
and
here
too
Thorpe
have
learn
his
error
.
<EOS>
the
Allens
,
he
believe
,
have
live
near
them
too
long
,
and
he
know
the
young
man
on
whom
the
Fullerton
estate
must
devolve
.
<EOS>
the
general
need
no
more
.
<EOS>
enrage
with
almost
everybody
in
the
world
but
himself
,
he
set
out
the
next
day
for
the
abbey
,
where
his
performance
have
be
see
.
  
<EOS>
I
leave
it
to
my
reader
's
sagacity
to
determine
how
much
of
all
this
it
be
possible
for
Henry
to
communicate
at
this
time
to
Catherine
,
how
much
of
it
he
could
have
learn
from
his
father
,
in
what
point
his
own
conjecture
may
assist
him
,
and
what
portion
must
yet
remain
to
be
tell
in
a
letter
from
James
.
<EOS>
I
have
unite
for
their
ease
what
they
must
divide
for
mine
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
at
any
rate
,
hear
enough
to
feel
that
in
suspect
General
Tilney
of
either
murder
or
shut
up
his
wife
,
she
have
scarcely
sin
against
his
character
,
or
magnify
his
cruelty
.
  
<EOS>
Henry
,
in
have
such
thing
to
relate
of
his
father
,
be
almost
as
pitiable
as
in
their
first
avowal
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
blush
for
the
narrow
-
minded
counsel
which
he
be
oblige
to
expose
.
<EOS>
the
conversation
between
them
at
Northanger
have
be
of
the
most
unfriendly
kind
.
<EOS>
Henry
's
indignation
on
hear
how
Catherine
have
be
treat
,
on
comprehend
his
father
's
view
,
and
be
order
to
acquiesce
in
them
,
have
be
open
and
bold
.
<EOS>
the
general
,
accustom
on
every
ordinary
occasion
to
give
the
law
in
his
family
,
prepare
for
no
reluctance
but
of
feeling
,
no
oppose
desire
that
should
dare
to
clothe
itself
in
word
,
could
ill
brook
the
opposition
of
his
son
,
steady
as
the
sanction
of
reason
and
the
dictate
of
conscience
could
make
it
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
such
a
cause
,
his
anger
,
though
it
must
shock
,
could
not
intimidate
Henry
,
who
be
sustain
in
his
purpose
by
a
conviction
of
its
justice
.
<EOS>
He
feel
himself
bind
as
much
in
honour
as
in
affection
to
Miss
Morland
,
and
believe
that
heart
to
be
his
own
which
he
have
be
direct
to
gain
,
no
unworthy
retraction
of
a
tacit
consent
,
no
reverse
decree
of
unjustifiable
anger
,
could
shake
his
fidelity
,
or
influence
the
resolution
it
prompt
.
  
<EOS>
He
steadily
refuse
to
accompany
his
father
into
Herefordshire
,
an
engagement
form
almost
at
the
moment
to
promote
the
dismissal
of
Catherine
,
and
as
steadily
declare
his
intention
of
offer
her
his
hand
.
<EOS>
the
general
be
furious
in
his
anger
,
and
they
part
in
dreadful
disagreement
.
<EOS>
Henry
,
in
an
agitation
of
mind
which
many
solitary
hour
be
require
to
compose
,
have
return
almost
instantly
to
Woodston
,
and
,
on
the
afternoon
of
the
follow
day
,
have
begin
his
journey
to
Fullerton
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Morland
's
surprise
on
be
apply
to
by
Mr.
Tilney
for
their
consent
to
his
marry
their
daughter
be
,
for
a
few
minute
,
considerable
,
it
have
never
enter
their
head
to
suspect
an
attachment
on
either
side
;
but
as
nothing
,
after
all
,
could
be
more
natural
than
Catherine
's
be
beloved
,
they
soon
learn
to
consider
it
with
only
the
happy
agitation
of
gratified
pride
,
and
,
as
far
as
they
alone
be
concern
,
have
not
a
single
objection
to
start
.
<EOS>
His
pleasing
manner
and
good
sense
be
self
-
evident
recommendation
;
and
have
never
hear
evil
of
him
,
it
be
not
their
way
to
suppose
any
evil
could
be
tell
.
<EOS>
Goodwill
supply
the
place
of
experience
,
his
character
need
no
attestation
.
<EOS>
"
Catherine
would
make
a
sad
,
heedless
young
housekeeper
to
be
sure
,
"
be
her
mother
's
foreboding
remark
;
but
quick
be
the
consolation
of
there
be
nothing
like
practice
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
but
one
obstacle
,
in
short
,
to
be
mention
;
but
till
that
one
be
remove
,
it
must
be
impossible
for
them
to
sanction
the
engagement
.
<EOS>
Their
temper
be
mild
,
but
their
principle
be
steady
,
and
while
his
parent
so
expressly
forbid
the
connection
,
they
could
not
allow
themselves
to
encourage
it
.
<EOS>
that
the
general
should
come
forward
to
solicit
the
alliance
,
or
that
he
should
even
very
heartily
approve
it
,
they
be
not
refine
enough
to
make
any
parade
stipulation
;
but
the
decent
appearance
of
consent
must
be
yield
,
and
that
once
obtain
 
and
their
own
heart
make
them
trust
that
it
could
not
be
very
long
deny
 
their
willing
approbation
be
instantly
to
follow
.
<EOS>
His
consent
be
all
that
they
wish
for
.
<EOS>
They
be
no
more
inclined
than
entitled
to
demand
his
money
.
<EOS>
of
a
very
considerable
fortune
,
his
son
be
,
by
marriage
settlement
,
eventually
secure
;
his
present
income
be
an
income
of
independence
and
comfort
,
and
under
every
pecuniary
view
,
it
be
a
match
beyond
the
claim
of
their
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
people
could
not
be
surprised
at
a
decision
like
this
.
<EOS>
They
feel
and
they
deplore
 
<EOS>
but
they
could
not
resent
it
;
and
they
part
,
endeavour
to
hope
that
such
a
change
in
the
general
,
as
each
believe
almost
impossible
,
may
speedily
take
place
,
to
unite
them
again
in
the
fullness
of
privileged
affection
.
<EOS>
Henry
return
to
what
be
now
his
only
home
,
to
watch
over
his
young
plantation
,
and
extend
his
improvement
for
her
sake
,
to
whose
share
in
them
he
look
anxiously
forward
;
and
Catherine
remain
at
Fullerton
to
cry
.
<EOS>
whether
the
torment
of
absence
be
soften
by
a
clandestine
correspondence
,
let
us
not
inquire
.
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Morland
never
do
 
<EOS>
they
have
be
too
kind
to
exact
any
promise
;
and
whenever
Catherine
receive
a
letter
,
as
,
at
that
time
,
happen
pretty
often
,
they
always
look
another
way
.
  
<EOS>
the
anxiety
,
which
in
this
state
of
their
attachment
must
be
the
portion
of
Henry
and
Catherine
,
and
of
all
who
love
either
,
as
to
its
final
event
,
can
hardly
extend
,
I
fear
,
to
the
bosom
of
my
reader
,
who
will
see
in
the
tell
-
tale
compression
of
the
page
before
them
,
that
we
be
all
hasten
together
to
perfect
felicity
.
<EOS>
the
mean
by
which
their
early
marriage
be
effect
can
be
the
only
doubt
:
<EOS>
what
probable
circumstance
could
work
upon
a
temper
like
the
general
's
?
<EOS>
the
circumstance
which
chiefly
avail
be
the
marriage
of
his
daughter
with
a
man
of
fortune
and
consequence
,
which
take
place
in
the
course
of
the
summer
 
an
accession
of
dignity
that
throw
him
into
a
fit
of
good
humour
,
from
which
he
do
not
recover
till
after
Eleanor
have
obtain
his
forgiveness
of
Henry
,
and
his
permission
for
him
"
to
be
a
fool
if
he
like
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
marriage
of
Eleanor
Tilney
,
her
removal
from
all
the
evil
of
such
a
home
as
Northanger
have
be
make
by
Henry
's
banishment
,
to
the
home
of
her
choice
and
the
man
of
her
choice
,
be
an
event
which
I
expect
to
give
general
satisfaction
among
all
her
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
My
own
joy
on
the
occasion
be
very
sincere
.
<EOS>
I
know
no
one
more
entitled
,
by
unpretende
merit
,
or
better
prepare
by
habitual
suffering
,
to
receive
and
enjoy
felicity
.
<EOS>
Her
partiality
for
this
gentleman
be
not
of
recent
origin
;
and
he
have
be
long
withhold
only
by
inferiority
of
situation
from
address
her
.
<EOS>
His
unexpected
accession
to
title
and
fortune
have
remove
all
his
difficulty
;
and
never
have
the
general
love
his
daughter
so
well
in
all
her
hour
of
companionship
,
utility
,
and
patient
endurance
as
when
he
first
hail
her
"
Your
ladyship
!
"
<EOS>
Her
husband
be
really
deserve
of
her
;
independent
of
his
peerage
,
his
wealth
,
and
his
attachment
,
be
to
a
precision
the
most
charming
young
man
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
any
further
definition
of
his
merit
must
be
unnecessary
;
the
most
charming
young
man
in
the
world
be
instantly
before
the
imagination
of
us
all
.
<EOS>
concern
the
one
in
question
,
therefore
,
I
have
only
to
add
 
aware
that
the
rule
of
composition
forbid
the
introduction
of
a
character
not
connect
with
my
fable
 
that
this
be
the
very
gentleman
whose
negligent
servant
leave
behind
him
that
collection
of
washing
-
bill
,
result
from
a
long
visit
at
Northanger
,
by
which
my
heroine
be
involve
in
one
of
her
most
alarming
adventure
.
  
<EOS>
the
influence
of
the
viscount
and
viscountess
in
their
brother
's
behalf
be
assist
by
that
right
understanding
of
Mr.
Morland
's
circumstance
which
,
as
soon
as
the
general
would
allow
himself
to
be
inform
,
they
be
qualified
to
give
.
<EOS>
It
teach
him
that
he
have
be
scarcely
more
mislead
by
Thorpe
's
first
boast
of
the
family
wealth
than
by
his
subsequent
malicious
overthrow
of
it
;
that
in
no
sense
of
the
word
be
they
necessitous
or
poor
,
and
that
Catherine
would
have
three
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
this
be
so
material
an
amendment
of
his
late
expectation
that
it
greatly
contribute
to
smooth
the
descent
of
his
pride
;
and
by
no
mean
without
its
effect
be
the
private
intelligence
,
which
he
be
at
some
pain
to
procure
,
that
the
Fullerton
estate
,
be
entirely
at
the
disposal
of
its
present
proprietor
,
be
consequently
open
to
every
greedy
speculation
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
strength
of
this
,
the
general
,
soon
after
Eleanor
's
marriage
,
permit
his
son
to
return
to
Northanger
,
and
thence
make
him
the
bearer
of
his
consent
,
very
courteously
word
in
a
page
full
of
empty
profession
to
Mr.
Morland
.
<EOS>
the
event
which
it
authorize
soon
follow
:
Henry
and
Catherine
be
marry
,
the
bell
ring
,
and
everybody
smile
;
and
,
as
this
take
place
within
a
twelvemonth
from
the
first
day
of
their
meeting
,
it
will
not
appear
,
after
all
the
dreadful
delay
occasion
by
the
general
's
cruelty
,
that
they
be
essentially
hurt
by
it
.
<EOS>
to
begin
perfect
happiness
at
the
respective
age
of
twenty
-
six
and
eighteen
be
to
do
pretty
well
;
and
profess
myself
moreover
convince
that
the
general
's
unjust
interference
,
so
far
from
be
really
injurious
to
their
felicity
,
be
perhaps
rather
conducive
to
it
,
by
improve
their
knowledge
of
each
other
,
and
add
strength
to
their
attachment
,
I
leave
it
to
be
settle
,
by
whomsoever
it
may
concern
,
whether
the
tendency
of
this
work
