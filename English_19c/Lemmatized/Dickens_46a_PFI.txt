<EOS>
if
the
reader
of
this
volume
will
be
so
kind
as
to
take
their
credential
for
the
different
place
which
be
the
subject
of
its
author
's
reminiscence
,
from
the
author
himself
,
perhaps
they
may
visit
them
,
in
fancy
,
the
more
agreeably
,
and
with
a
well
understanding
of
what
they
be
to
expect
.
  
<EOS>
many
book
have
be
write
upon
Italy
,
afford
many
mean
of
study
the
history
of
that
interesting
country
,
and
the
innumerable
association
entwine
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
but
<EOS>
little
reference
to
that
stock
of
information
;
not
at
all
regard
it
as
a
necessary
consequence
of
my
have
<EOS>
have
recourse
to
the
storehouse
for
my
own
benefit
,
that
I
should
reproduce
its
easily
accessible
content
before
the
eye
of
my
reader
.
  
<EOS>
neither
will
there
be
find
,
in
these
page
,
any
grave
examination
into
the
government
or
misgovernment
of
any
portion
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
no
visitor
of
that
beautiful
land
can
fail
to
have
a
strong
conviction
on
the
subject
;
but
as
I
choose
when
reside
there
,
a
Foreigner
,
to
abstain
from
the
discussion
of
any
such
question
with
any
order
of
Italians
,
so
I
would
rather
not
enter
on
the
inquiry
now
.
 
<EOS>
during
my
twelve
month
'
occupation
of
a
house
at
Genoa
,
I
never
find
that
authority
constitutionally
jealous
be
distrustful
of
me
;
and
I
should
be
sorry
to
give
them
occasion
to
regret
their
free
courtesy
,
either
to
myself
or
any
of
my
countryman
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
,
probably
,
not
a
famous
Picture
or
Statue
in
all
Italy
,
but
could
be
easily
bury
under
a
mountain
of
print
paper
devote
to
dissertation
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
,
therefore
,
though
an
earnest
admirer
of
Painting
and
Sculpture
,
expatiate
at
any
length
on
famous
Pictures
and
Statues
.
  
<EOS>
this
Book
be
a
series
of
faint
reflection
---
mere
shadow
in
the
water
---
of
place
to
which
the
imagination
of
most
people
be
attract
in
a
great
or
less
degree
,
on
which
mine
have
dwell
for
year
,
and
which
have
some
interest
for
all
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
part
of
the
description
be
write
on
the
spot
,
and
send
home
,
from
time
to
time
,
in
private
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
mention
the
circumstance
as
an
excuse
for
any
defect
they
may
present
,
for
it
would
be
none
;
but
as
a
guarantee
to
the
reader
that
they
be
at
least
pen
in
the
fulness
of
the
subject
,
and
with
the
lively
impression
of
novelty
and
freshness
.
  
<EOS>
if
they
have
ever
a
fanciful
and
idle
air
,
perhaps
the
reader
will
suppose
them
write
in
the
shade
of
a
Sunny
Day
,
in
the
midst
of
the
object
of
which
they
treat
,
and
will
like
them
none
the
bad
for
have
such
influence
of
the
country
upon
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
I
be
not
likely
to
be
misunderstood
by
professor
of
the
roman
catholic
faith
,
on
account
of
anything
contain
in
these
page
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
do
my
good
,
in
one
of
my
former
production
,
to
do
justice
to
them
;
and
I
trust
,
in
this
,
they
will
do
justice
to
me
.
<EOS>
when
I
mention
any
exhibition
that
impress
me
as
absurd
or
disagreeable
,
I
do
not
seek
to
connect
it
,
or
recognise
it
as
necessarily
connect
with
,
any
essential
of
their
creed
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
treat
of
the
ceremony
of
the
Holy
Week
,
I
merely
treat
of
their
effect
,
and
do
not
challenge
the
good
and
learn
Dr.
Wiseman
's
interpretation
of
their
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
hint
a
dislike
of
nunnery
for
young
girl
who
abjure
the
world
before
they
have
ever
prove
or
know
it
;
or
doubt
the
EX
OFFICIO
sanctity
of
all
Priests
and
friar
;
I
do
no
more
than
many
conscientious
Catholics
both
abroad
and
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
liken
these
Pictures
to
shadow
in
the
water
,
and
would
fain
hope
that
I
have
,
nowhere
,
stir
the
water
so
roughly
,
as
to
mar
the
shadow
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
never
desire
to
be
on
well
term
with
all
my
friend
than
now
,
when
distant
mountain
rise
,
once
more
,
in
my
path
.
 
<EOS>
for
I
need
not
hesitate
to
avow
,
that
,
bent
on
correct
a
brief
mistake
I
make
,
not
long
ago
,
in
disturb
the
old
relation
between
myself
and
my
reader
,
and
depart
for
a
moment
from
my
old
pursuit
,
I
be
about
to
resume
them
,
joyfully
,
in
Switzerland
;
where
during
another
year
of
absence
,
I
can
at
once
work
out
the
theme
I
have
now
in
my
mind
,
without
interruption
:
and
while
I
keep
my
english
audience
within
speak
distance
,
extend
my
knowledge
of
a
noble
country
,
inexpressibly
attractive
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
this
book
be
make
as
accessible
as
possible
,
because
it
would
be
a
great
pleasure
to
me
if
I
could
hope
,
through
its
mean
,
to
compare
impression
with
some
among
the
multitude
who
will
hereafter
visit
the
scene
describe
with
interest
and
delight
.
  
<EOS>
and
I
have
only
now
,
in
passport
wise
,
to
sketch
my
reader
's
portrait

I

may

go
through
France
 
on
a
fine
Sunday
morning
in
the
Midsummer
time
and
weather
of
eighteen
hundred
and
forty
-
four
,
it
be
,
my
good
friend
,
when
---
do
not
be
alarm
;
not
when
two
traveller
may
have
be
observe
slowly
make
their
way
over
that
picturesque
and
broken
ground
by
which
the
first
chapter
of
a
Middle
aged
novel
be
usually
attain
---
but
when
an
English
travelling
-
carriage
of
considerable
proportion
,
fresh
from
the
shady
hall
of
the
Pantechnicon
near
Belgrave
Square
,
London
,
be
observe
(
by
a
very
small
french
soldier
;
for
I
see
him
look
at
it
)
to
issue
from
the
gate
of
the
Hotel
Meurice
in
the
Rue
Rivoli
at
Paris
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
no
more
bind
to
explain
why
the
english
family
travel
by
this
carriage
,
inside
and
out
,
should
be
start
for
Italy
on
a
Sunday
morning
,
of
all
good
day
in
the
week
,
than
I
be
to
assign
a
reason
for
all
the
little
man
in
France
be
soldier
,
and
all
the
big
man
postilion
;
which
be
the
invariable
rule
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
they
have
some
sort
of
reason
for
what
they
do
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
;
and
their
reason
for
be
there
at
all
,
be
,
as
you
know
,
that
they
be
go
to
live
in
fair
Genoa
for
a
year
;
and
that
the
head
of
the
family
purpose
,
in
that
space
of
time
,
to
stroll
about
,
wherever
his
restless
humour
carry
him
.
  
<EOS>
and
it
would
have
be
small
comfort
to
me
to
have
explain
to
the
population
of
Paris
generally
,
<EOS>
that
I
be
that
Head
and
Chief
;
and
not
the
radiant
embodiment
of
good
humour
who
sit
beside
me
in
the
person
of
a
French
Courier
---
good
of
servant
and
most
beam
of
man
!
 
<EOS>
truth
to
say
,
he
look
a
great
deal
more
patriarchal
than
I
,
who
,
in
the
shadow
of
his
portly
presence
,
dwindle
down
to
no
account
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
,
of
course
,
very
little
in
the
aspect
of
Paris
---
as
we
rattle
near
the
dismal
Morgue
and
over
the
Pont
Neuf
---
to
reproach
us
for
our
Sunday
travel
.

a

one
day
's
proceeding

a
sketch
of
all
three

and
here
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
four
horse
,
and
one
postilion
,
who
have
a
very
long
whip
,
and
drive
his
team
,
something
like
the
Courier
of
Saint
Petersburgh
in
the
circle
at
Astley
's
or
Franconi
's
:
 
<EOS>
only
he
sit
his
own
horse
instead
of
stand
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
immense
jack
-
boot
wear
by
these
postilion
,
be
sometimes
a
century
or
two
old
;
and
be
so
ludicrously
disproportionate
to
the
wearer
's
foot
,
that
the
spur
,
which
be
put
where
his
own
heel
come
,
be
generally
halfway
up
the
leg
of
the
boot
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
often
come
out
of
the
stable
-
yard
,
with
his
whip
in
his
hand
and
his
shoe
on
,
and
bring
out
,
in
both
hand
,
one
boot
at
a
time
,
which
he
plant
on
the
ground
by
the
side
of
his
horse
,
with
great
gravity
,
until
everything
be
ready
.
 
<EOS>
when
it
be
---
<EOS>
and
oh
Heaven
!
<EOS>
the
noise
they
make
about
it
!
---
<EOS>
he
get
into
the
boot
,
shoe
and
all
,
or
be
hoist
into
them
by
a
couple
of
friend
;
adjust
the
rope
harness
,
emboss
by
the
labour
of
innumerable
pigeon
in
the
stable
;
make
all
the
horse
kick
and
plunge
;
crack
his
whip
like
a
madman
;
shout
"
en
route
---
hi
!
"
<EOS>
and
away
we
go
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
sure
to
have
a
contest
with
his
horse
before
we
have
go
very
far
;
and
then
he
call
him
a
thief
,
and
a
Brigand
,
and
a
Pig
,
and
what
not
;
and
beat
him
about
the
head
as
if
he
be
make
of
wood
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
little
more
than
one
variety
in
the
appearance
of
the
country
,
for
the
first
two
day
.
 
<EOS>
from
a
dreary
plain
,
to
an
interminable
avenue

from
an
interminable
avenue
to
a
dreary
plain
again

<EOS>
plenty

queer

odd

grotesque

other
strange

and
in

all
alone

and
always
round

with
a
peaked
roof

and
never
use

any
purpose
at

ruinous
building
of
all

You

at

as

<EOS>
here
be
a

out

like

out

dismal

<EOS>
the

and
all
the

whose

and
sweltering

<EOS>
the

high

vast

dirty

rotten
as
old

and
as
thickly

<EOS>
all
up
the

that
hem
the

these

swarm
;
and
the

inside
be
loll
out

and
dry
their
ragged

crawl
in

<EOS>
every
manufacturing
town
,
melt
into
one
,
would
hardly
convey
an
impression
of
Lyons
as
it
present
itself
to
me
:
 
for
all
the
undrained
,
unscavengered
quality
of
a
foreign
town
,
seem
grafted
,
there
,
upon
the
native
misery
of
a
manufacture
one
;
and
it
bear
such
fruit
as
I
would
go
some
mile
out
of
my
way
to
avoid
encounter
again
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
:
 
or
rather
in
the
faded
heat
of
the
day
:
 
we
go
to
see
the
Cathedral
,
where
diver
old
woman
,
and
a
few
dog
,
be
engage
in
contemplation
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
difference
,
in
point
of
cleanliness
,
between
its
stone
pavement
and
that
of
the
street
;
and
there
be
a
wax
saint
,
in
a
little
box
like
a
berth
aboard
ship
,
with
a
glass
front
to
it
,
whom
Madame
Tussaud
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
,
on
any
term
,
and
which
even
Westminster
Abbey
may
be
ashamed
of
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
would
know
all
about
the
architecture
of
this
church
,
or
any
other
,
its
date
,
dimension
,
endowment
,
and
history
,
be
it
not
write
in
Mr
Murray
's
Guide
-
Book
,
and
may
you
not
read
it
there
,
with
thank
to
him
,
as
I
do
!
  
<EOS>
for
this
reason
,
I
should
abstain
from
mention
the
curious
clock
in
Lyons
Cathedral
,
if
it
be
not
for
a
small
mistake
I
make
,
in
connection
with
that
piece
of
mechanism
.
 
<EOS>
the
keeper
of
the
church
be
very
anxious
it
should
be
show
;
partly
for
the
honour
of
the
establishment
and
the
town
;
and
partly
,
perhaps
,
because
of
his
derive
a
percentage
from
the
additional
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
however
that
may
be
,
it
be
set
in
motion
,
and
thereupon
a
host
of
little
door
fly
open
,
and
innumerable
little
figure
stagger
out
of
them
,
and
jerk
themselves
back
again
,
with
that
special
unsteadiness
of
purpose
,
and
hitching
in
the
gait
,
which
usually
attach
to
figure
that
be
move
by
clock
-
work
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
Sacristan
stand
explain
these
wonder
,
and
point
them
out
,
severally
,
with
a
wand
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
centre
puppet
of
the
Virgin
Mary
;
and
close
to
her
,
a
small
pigeon
-
hole
,
out
of
which
another
and
a
very
ill
-
look
puppet
make
one
of
the
most
sudden
plunge
I
ever
see
accomplish
:
 
instantly
flop
back
again
at
sight
of
her
,
and
bang
his
little
door
violently
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
take
this
to
be
emblematic
of
the
victory
over
Sin
and
Death
,
and
not
at
all
unwilling
to
show
that
I
perfectly
understand
the
subject
,
<EOS>
in
anticipation
of
the
showman

I
rashly

"

"
Pardon

the

with

polite

towards
the

,
as

<EOS>
soon
after
daybreak
next

,
we
be
steam
down
the
Arrowy
Rhone
,
at
the
rate
of
twenty
mile
an

,
in
a
very
dirty

full

with
only
three

immeasurably

<EOS>
for

and
scatter

make
it
very
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
height
of
these
,
too
,
make
the
building
look
so
tiny
,
that
they
have
all
the
charm
of
elegant

their
excessive
whiteness

with
the
brown
rock

or
the
sombre

deep

heavy

and
the
puny
size
,
and
little

make
a
charming

there

<EOS>
there
lie
before
us
,
that
same
afternoon
,
the
broken
bridge
of
Avignon
,
and
all
the
city
baking
in

yet
with

all

by

of
quiet
sleepy
court

stately
old

as
silent
as

<EOS>
It
be
all
very
like
one
of
the
description
in
the
Arabian
Nights
.
 
<EOS>
the

Calenders
may
have
knock

<EOS>
after
breakfast
next
morning

we
sally
forth
to
see
the
lion
.
<EOS>
such
a
delicious
breeze
be
blow
in
,
from
the
north
,
as
make
the
walk
delightful
:
 
though
the
pavement
-
stone
,
and
stone
of
the
wall
and
house
,
be
far
too
hot
to
have
a
hand
lay
on
them
comfortably
.
  
<EOS>
We
go
,
first
of
all
,
up
a
rocky
height
,
to
the
cathedral
:
 
where
Mass
be
perform
to
an
auditory
very
like
that
of
Lyons
,
namely
,
several
old
woman
,
a
baby
,
and
a
very
self
-
possess
dog
,
who
have
mark
out
for
himself
a
little
course
or
platform
for
exercise
,
begin
at
the
altar
-
rail
and
end
at
the
door
,
up
and
down
which
constitutional
walk
he
trot
,
during
the
service
,
as
methodically
and
calmly
,
as
any
old
gentleman
out
of
door
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
bare
old
church
,
and
the
painting
in
the
roof
be
sadly
deface
by
time
and
damp
weather
;
but
the
sun
be
shine
in
,
splendidly
,
through
the
red
curtain
of
the
window
,
and
glitter
on
the
altar
furniture
;
and
it
look
as
bright
and
cheerful
as
need
be
.
  
<EOS>
go
apart
,
in
this
church
,
to
see
some
painting
which
be
be
execute
in
fresco
by
a
french
artist
and
his
pupil
,
I
be
lead
to
observe
more
closely
than
I
may
otherwise
have
do
,
a
great
number
of
votive
offering
with
which
the
wall
of
the
different
chapel
be
profusely
hang
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
decorate
,
for
they
be
very
roughly
and
comically
get
up
;
most
likely
by
poor
sign
-
painter
,
who
eke
out
their
living
in
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
all
little
picture
:
 
each
represent
some
sickness
or
calamity
from
which
the
person
place
it
there
,
have
escape
,
through
the
interposition
of
his
or
her
patron
saint
,
or
of
the
Madonna
;
and
I
may
refer
to
them
as
good
specimen
of
the
class
generally
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
abundant
in
Italy
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
grotesque
squareness
of
outline
,
and
impossibility
of
perspective
,
they
be
not
unlike
the
woodcut
in
old
book
;
but
they
be
oil
-
painting
,
and
the
artist
,
like
the
painter
of
the
Primrose
family
,
have
not
be
spare
of
his
colour
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
,
a
lady
be
have
a
toe
amputate
---
an
operation
which
a
saintly
personage
have
sail
into
the
room
,
upon
a
couch
,
to
superintend
.
<EOS>
in
another
,
a
lady
be
lie
in
bed
,
tuck
up
very
tight
and
prim
,
and
stare
with
much
composure
at
a
tripod
,
with
a
slop
-
basin
on
it
;
the
usual
form
of
washing
-
stand
,
and
the
only
piece
of
furniture
,
besides
the
bedstead
,
in
her
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
one
would
never
have
suppose
her
to
be
labour
under
any
complaint
,
beyond
the
inconvenience
of
be
miraculously
wide
awake
,
if
the
painter
have
not
hit
upon
the
idea
of
put
all
her
family
on
their
knee
in
one
corner
,
with
their
leg
stick
out
behind
them
on
the
floor
,
like
boot
-
tree
.
 
<EOS>
above
whom
,
the
Virgin
,
on
a
kind
of
blue
divan
,
promise
to
restore
the
patient
.
 
<EOS>
in
another
case
,
a
lady
be
in
the
very
act
of
be
run
over
,
immediately
outside
the
city
wall
,
by
a
sort
of
piano
-
forte
van
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
Madonna
be
there
again
.
<EOS>
whether
the
supernatural
appearance
have
startle
the
horse
(
a
bay
griffin
)
,
or
whether
it
be
invisible
to
him
,
I
do
not
know
;
but
he
be
gallop
away
,
ding
dong
,
without
the
small
reverence
or
compunction
.
 
<EOS>
on
every
picture
"
Ex
voto
"
be
paint
in
yellow
capital
in
the
sky
.
  
<EOS>
though
votive
offering
be
not
unknown
in
Pagan
Temples
,
and
be
evidently
among
the
many
compromise
make
between
the
false
religion
and
the
true
,
when
the
true
be
in
its
infancy
,
I
could
wish
that
all
the
other
compromise
be
as
harmless
.
 
<EOS>
Gratitude
and
Devotion
be
christian
quality
;
and
a
grateful
,
humble
,
christian
spirit
may
dictate
the
observance
.
  
<EOS>
hard
by
the
cathedral
stand
the
ancient
Palace
of
the
Popes
,
of
which
one
portion
be
now
a
common
jail

and
another
a
noisy
barrack

while
gloomy
suite
of
state
apartment

shut
up
and
desert
,
mock
their
own
old
state
and
glory
,
like
the

but
we
neither
go
there
,
to
see
state

nor
soldier

quarter

nor
a

we
drop
some

whilst

look
through
the

us
eagerly

sink

in

with

like
chimney

its

counter

with
bottle

I
walk
round
the

outside
,
in
a
sort
of
dream
,
and
yet
with
the
delightful
sense
of
have
awaken
from
it
,
of
which
the
light

down

have
give
me
the
assurance

the

its
gigantic
proportion

frown
aspect

and
barbarous
irregularity

awaken
awe

wonder

<EOS>
the
recollection
of
its
opposite
old
use
:
 
an
impregnable
fortress
,
a
luxurious
palace
,
a
horrible
prison
,
a
place
of
torture
,
the
court
of
the
Inquisition
:
at
one
and
the
same
time
,
a
house
of
feasting
,
fighting
,
religion
,
and
blood
:
 
give
to
every
stone
in

huge
form
a
fearful
interest

impart
new
meaning
to
its
incongruity

I
could
think

little

however

then

long

the

<EOS>
the
palace
come
down
to
be
the
lounge

place
of
noisy
soldier
,
and
be
force
to
echo
their
rough
talk
,
and
common
oath
,
and
to
have
their
garment
flutter
from
its
dirty
window
,
be
some
reduction
of

state

something
to
rejoice
at
;

the
day
in

the

desolation

defeat

if
I
have
see
it
in

I
should
have
feel
that
not
that
light
,
nor
all
the
light
in
all
the
fire
that
burn
,
could
waste
it
,
like
the
sunbeam

its
secret
council

chamber

its
prison

<EOS>
before
I
quit
this
Palace
of
the
Popes
,
let
me
translate
from
the
little
history
I
mention
just
now
,
a
short
anecdote
,
quite
appropriate
to
itself
,
connect
with
its
adventure
.
  
<EOS>
"
an
ancient
tradition
relate
,
that
in
1441
,
a
nephew
of
Pierre
de
Lude
,
the
Pope
's
legate
,
seriously
insult
some
distinguished
lady
of
Avignon
,
whose
relation
,
in
revenge
,
seize
the
young
man
,
and
horribly
mutilate
him
.
 
<EOS>
for
several
year
the
legate
keep
his
revenge
within
his
own
breast
,
but
he
be
not
the
less
resolve
upon
its
gratification
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
He
even
make
,
in
the
fulness
of
time
,
advance
towards
a
complete
reconciliation
;
and
when
their
apparent
sincerity
have
prevail
,
he
invite
to
a
splendid
banquet
,
in
this
palace
,
certain
family
,
whole
family
,
whom
he
seek
to
exterminate
.
 
<EOS>
the
utmost
gaiety
animate
the
repast
;
but
the
measure
of
the
legate
be
well
take
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
dessert
be
on
the
board
,
a
Swiss
present
himself
,
with
the
announcement
that
a
strange
ambassador
solicit
an
extraordinary
audience
.
 
<EOS>
the
legate
,
excuse
himself
,
for
the
moment
,
to
his
guest
,
retire
,
follow
by
his
officer
.
 
<EOS>
within
a
few
minute
afterwards
,
five
hundred
person
be
reduce
to
ashe
:
 
<EOS>
the
whole
of
that

"
  
<EOS>
after
see
the
church
(
I
will
not
trouble
you
with
church
just
now
)
,
we
leave
Avignon
that
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
the
heat
be
very
great
,
the
road
outside
the
wall
be
strew
with
people
fast
asleep
in
every
little
slip
of
shade
,
and
with
lazy
group
,
half
asleep
and
half
awake
,
who
be
wait
until
the
sun
should
be
low
enough
to
admit
of
their
playing
bowl
among
the
burn
-
up
tree
,
and
on
the
dusty
road
.
 
<EOS>
the
harvest
here
be
already
gather
in
,
and
mule
and
horse
be
tread
out
the
corn
in
the
field
.
 
<EOS>
We
come
,
at
dusk
,
upon
a
wild
and
hilly
country
,
once
famous
for
brigand
;
and
travel
slowly
up
a
steep
ascent
.
 
<EOS>
so
we
go
on
,
until
eleven
at
night
,
when
we
halt
at
the
town
of
Aix
(
within
two
stage
of
Marseilles
)
to
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
the
hotel
,
with
all
the
blind
and
shutter
close
to
keep
the
light
and
heat
out
,
be
comfortable
and
airy
next
morning
,
and
the
town
be
very
clean
;
but
so
hot
,
and
so
intensely
light
,
that
when
I
walk
out
at
noon
it
be
like
come
suddenly
from
the
darkened
room
into
crisp
blue
fire
.
 
<EOS>
the
air
be
so
very
clear
,
that
distant
hill
and
rocky
point
appear
within
an
hour
's
walk
;
while
the
town
immediately
at
hand
---
with
a
kind
of
blue
wind
between
me
and
it
---
seem
to
be
white
hot
,
and
to
be
throw
off
a
fiery
air
from
the
surface
.
  
<EOS>
We
leave
this
town
towards
evening
,
and
take
the
road
to
Marseilles
.
<EOS>
a
dusty
road
it
be
;
the
house
shut
up
close
;
and
the
vine
powder
white
.
 
<EOS>
at
nearly
all
the
cottage
door
,
woman
be
peel
and
slice
onion
into
earthen
bowl
for
supper
.
 
<EOS>
so
they
have
be
do
last
night
all
the
way
from
Avignon
.
 
<EOS>
We
pass
one
or
two
shady
dark
chateaux
,
surround
by
tree
,
and
embellish
with
cool
basin
of
water
:
 
which
be
the
more
refreshing
to
behold
,
from
the
great
scarcity
of
such
residence
on
the
road
we
have
travel
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
approach
Marseilles
,
the
road
begin
to
be
cover
with
holiday
people
.
 
<EOS>
outside
the
public
-
house
be
party
smoke
,
drinking
,
play
draught
and
card
,
and
(
once
)
dance
.
 
<EOS>
but
dust
,
dust
,
dust
,
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
We
go
on
,
through
a
long
,
straggle
,
dirty
suburb
,
throng
with
people
;
have
on
our
leave
a
dreary
slope
of
land
,
on
which
the
country
-
house
of
the
Marseilles
merchant
,
always
stare
white
,
be
jumble
and
heap
without
the
slight
order
:
 
back
,
front
,
side
,
and
gable
towards
all
point
of
the
compass
;
until
,
at
last
,
we
enter
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
there
,
twice
or
thrice
afterwards
,
in
fair
weather
and
foul
;
and
I
be
afraid
there
be
no
doubt
that
it
be
a
dirty
and
disagreeable
place
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
prospect
,
from
the
fortified
height
,
of
the
beautiful
Mediterranean
,
with
its
lovely
rock
and
island
,
be
most
delightful
.
 
<EOS>
these
height
be
a
desirable
retreat
,
for
less
picturesque
reason
---
as
an
escape
from
a
compound
of
vile
smell
perpetually
arise
from
a
great
harbour
full
of
stagnant
water
,
and
befoul
by
the
refuse
of
innumerable
ship
with
all
sort
of
cargo
:
 
which
,
in
hot
weather
,
be
dreadful
in
the
last
degree
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
foreign

<EOS>
there

themselves
on
the
top
of
their
house
,
or
walk
up

down
the
close
and
least
airy
of
Boulevards
;
and
there
be
crowd
of
fierce

look
people
of
the
low
sort
,
block
up
the
way
,
constantly
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
very
heart
of
all
this
stir
and
uproar
,
be
the
common
madhouse
;
a
low
,
contract
,
miserable
building
,
look
straight
upon
the
street
,
without
the
small
screen
or
court

yard
;
where
chatter
mad

man
and
mad

woman
be
peep
out
,
through
rusty

at
the
stare
face
below
,
while
the
sun
,
dart
fiercely
aslant
into
their
little
cell
,
seem
to
dry
up
their
brain
,
and
worry
them
,
as
if
they
be
bait
by
a
pack
of
dog
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
pretty
well
accommodate
at
the
Hotel

cool

on

pavement
outside

enjoy
the
gratification
of

with
lazy
dignity

<EOS>
the
family
have
retire
to
rest
when
we

there
,
with
his

stretch
out
before

and
evidently

<EOS>
next

by

<EOS>
We

early
next

within
a

mile
of
the
Cornice
road
(
of
which

nearly
all
day

<EOS>
We
could
see
Genoa
before

terrace

stately

<EOS>
have
be
duly
astonish

here

by

sight
of
a

cappucini
monk

who
be
watch
the

weighing

<EOS>
the

but
not
through
the
Strada
Nuova

or
the
Strada
Balbi
,
which
be
the
famous
street
of
palace
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
in
my
life
be
so
dismay
!
 
<EOS>
the
wonderful
novelty
of
everything
,
the
unusual
smell
,
the
unaccountable
filth
(
though
it
be
reckon
the
clean
of
italian
town
)
,
the
disorderly
jumbling
of
dirty
house
,
one
upon
the
roof
of
another
;
the
passage
more
squalid
and
more
close
than
any
in
St
Giles
's
or
old
Paris
;
in
and
out
of
which
,
not
vagabond
,
but
well
-
dress
woman
,
with
white
veil
and
great
fan

be
pass
and
repasse

the
perfect
absence
of
resemblance
in
any
dwelling
-
house
,
or
shop
,
or
wall
,
or
post
,
or
pillar
,
to
anything
one
have
ever
see
before
;
and
the
dishearten
dirt
,
discomfort
,
and
decay
;
perfectly
confound
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
fall
into
a
dismal
reverie
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
conscious
of
a
feverish
and
bewildered
vision
of
saint
and
virgin
'
shrine
at
the
street
corner
---
of
great
number
of
friar
,
monk
,
and
soldier
---
of
vast
red
curtain
,
wave
in
the
doorway
of
the
church
---
of
always
go
up
hill
,
and
yet
see
every
other
street
and
passage
go
high
up
---
of
fruit
-
stall
,
with
fresh
lemon
and
orange
hang
in
garland
make
of
vine
-
leave
---
of
a
guard
-
house
,
and
a
drawbridge
---
and
some
gateway
---
and
vendor
of
iced
water
,
sit
with
little
tray
upon
the
margin
of
the
kennel
---
and
this
be
all
the
consciousness
I
have
,
until
I
be
set
down
in
a
rank
,
dull
,
weedy
court
-
yard
,
attach
to
a
kind
of
pink
jail
;
and
be
tell
I
live
there
.
  
<EOS>
I
little
thought
,
that
day
,
that
I
should
ever
come
to
have
an
attachment
for
the
very
stone
in
the
street
of
Genoa
,
and
to
look
back
upon
the
city
with
affection
as
connect
with
many
hour
of
happiness
and
quiet
!
 
<EOS>
but
these
be
my
first
impression
honestly
set
down
;
and
how
they
change
,
I
will
set
down
too
.
 
<EOS>
at
present
,
let
us
breathe
after
this
long
-
winded
journey
.
    
<EOS>
Genoa
and
its
neighbourhood
 
<EOS>
the
first
impression
of
such
a
place
as
albaro
,
the
suburb
of
Genoa
,
where
I
be
now
,
as
my
american
friend
would
say
,
"
locate
,
"
can
hardly
fail
<EOS>
,
I
should
imagine
,
to
be
mournful
and
disappointing
.
 
<EOS>
It
require
a
little
time
and
use
to
overcome
the
feeling
of
depression
consequent
,
at
first
,
on
so
much
ruin
and
neglect
.
 
<EOS>
Novelty
,
pleasant
to
most
people
,
be
particularly
delightful
,
I
think
,
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
easily
dispirit
when
I
have
the
mean
of
pursue
my
own
fancy
and
occupation
;
and
I
believe
I
have
some
natural
aptitude
for
accommodate
myself
to
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
yet
,
I
stroll
about
here
,
in
all
the
hole
and
corner
of
the
neighbourhood
,
in
a
perpetual
state
of
forlorn
surprise
;
and
return
to
my
villa
:
 
the
Villa
Bagnerello
(
it
sound
romantic
,
but
<EOS>
Signor
Bagnerello
be
a
butcher
hard
by
)
:
 
have
sufficient
occupation
in
ponder
over
my
new
experience
,
and
compare
them
,
very
much
to
my
own
amusement
,
with
my
expectation
,
until
I
wander
out
again
.
  
<EOS>
the
Villa
Bagnerello
:
 
or
the
Pink
Jail
,
a
far
more
expressive
name
for
the
mansion
:
 
be
in
one
of
the
most
splendid
situation
imaginable
.
 
<EOS>
the
noble
bay
of
Genoa
,
with
the
deep
blue
Mediterranean
<EOS>
,
lie
stretch
out
near
at
hand
;
monstrous
old
desolate
house
and
palace
be
dot
all
about

lofty
hill

with
their
top
often
hide
in
the
cloud
,
and
with
strong
fort
perch
high
up
on
their
craggy
side
,
be
close
upon
the
left

and
in
front
,
stretch
from
the
wall
of
the
house
,
down
to
a
ruin
chapel
which
stand
upon
the
bold
and
picturesque
rock
on
the
sea
-
shore
,
be
green
vineyard
,
where
you
may
wander
all
day
long
in
partial
shade
,
through
interminable
vista
of
grape
,
train
on
a
rough
trellis
-
work
across
the
narrow
path
.
  
<EOS>
this
sequester
spot
be
approach
by
lane
so
very
narrow
,
that
when
we
arrive
at
the
Custom
-
house
,
we
find
the
people
here
have
TAKEN
the
measure
of
the
narrow
among
them
,
and
be
wait
to
apply
it
to
the
carriage
;
which
ceremony
be
gravely
perform
in
the
street
,
while
we
all
stand
by
in
breathless
suspense
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
find
to
be
a
very
tight
fit
,
but
just
a
possibility
,
and
no
more
---
as
I
be
remind
every
day
,
by
the
sight
of
various
large
hole
which
it
punch
in
the
wall
on
either
side
as
it
come
along
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
more
fortunate
,
I
be
tell
,
than
an
old
lady
,
who
take
a
house
in
these
part
not
long
ago
,
and
who
stick
fast
in
HER
carriage
in
a
lane
;
and
as
it
be
impossible
to
open
one
of
the
door
,
she
be
oblige
to
submit
to
the
indignity
of
be
haul
through
one
of
the
little
front
window
,
like
a
harlequin
.
  
<EOS>
when
you
have
get
through
these
narrow
lane
,
you
come
to
an
archway
,
imperfectly
stop
up
by
a
rusty
old
gate
---
my
gate
.
 
<EOS>
the
rusty
old
gate
have
a
bell
to
correspond
,
which
you
ring
as
long
as
you
like
,
and
which
nobody
answer
,
as
it
have
no
connection
whatever
with
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
rusty
old
knocker
,
too
---
very
loose
,
so
that
it
slide
round
when
you
touch
it
---
and
if
you
learn
the
trick
of
it
,
and
knock
long
enough
,
somebody
come
.
 
<EOS>
the
brave
Courier
come
,
and
give
you
admittance
.
 
<EOS>
You
walk
into
a
seedy
little
garden
,
all
wild
and
weedy
,
from
which
the
vineyard
open
;
cross
it
,
enter
a
square
hall
like
a
cellar
,
walk
up
a
crack
marble
staircase
,
and
pass
into
a
most
enormous
room
with
a
vaulted
roof
and
whitewash
wall
:
 
not
unlike
a
great
Methodist
chapel
.
 
<EOS>
this

It

those

London
who
hang
up

as
a
sign

a
picture
divide

like
death
and
the
lady

at
the
top

the
old

which
always
leave
you
in
a
state
of
uncertainty
whether
the
ingenious
professor
have
clean
one
half

or
dirty
the
other

They

name
Antonio

two

a

hang

<EOS>
the
old
man
be
very
anxious
to
convert
me
to
the
catholic
faith
,
and
exhort
me
frequently
.
 
<EOS>
We
sit
upon
a
stone
by
the
door
,
sometimes
in
the
evening
,
like
Robinson
Crusoe
and
Friday
reverse
;
and
he
generally
relate
,
towards
my
conversion
,
an
abridgment
of
the
history
of
Saint
Peter
---
<EOS>
chiefly
,
I
believe
,
from
the
unspeakable
delight
he
have
in
his
imitation
of
the
cock
.
  
<EOS>
the
view
,
as
I
have
say
,
be
charming
;
but
in
the
day
you
must
keep
the
lattice
-
blind
close
shut
,
or
the
sun
would
drive
you
mad
;
and
when
the
sun
go
down
you
must
shut
up
all
the
window
,
or
the
mosquito
would
tempt
you
to
commit
suicide
.
 
<EOS>
so
at
this
time
of
the
year
,
you
do
not
see
much
of
the
prospect
within
door
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
the
fly
,
you
do
not
mind
them
.
 
<EOS>
nor
the
flea
,
whose
size
be
prodigious
,
and
whose
name
be
Legion
,
and
who
populate
the
coach
-
house
to
that
extent
that
I
daily
expect
to
see
the
carriage
go
off
bodily
,
draw
by
myriad
of
industrious
flea
in
harness
.
 
<EOS>
the
rat
be
keep
away
,
quite
comfortably
,
by
score
of
lean
cat
,
who
roam
about
the
garden
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
the
lizard
,
of
course
,
nobody
care
for
;
they
play
in
the
sun
,
and
do
not
bite
.
 
<EOS>
the
little
scorpion
be
merely
curious
.
 
<EOS>
the
beetle
be
rather
late
,
and
have
not
appear
yet
.
 
<EOS>
the
frog
be
company
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
preserve
of
them
in
the
ground
of
the
next
villa
;
and
after
nightfall
,
one
would
think
that
score
upon
score
of
woman
in
patten
be
go
up
and
down
a
wet
stone
pavement
without
a
moment
's
cessation
.
<EOS>
that
be
exactly
the
noise
they
make
.
  
<EOS>
the
ruin
chapel
,
on
the
picturesque
and
beautiful
seashore
,
be
dedicate
,
once
upon
a
time
,
to
Saint
John
the
Baptist
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
there
be
a
legend
that
Saint
John
's
bone
be
receive
there
,
with
various
solemnity
,
when
they
be
first
bring
to
Genoa
;
for
Genoa
possess
them
to
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
when
there
be
any
uncommon
temp
at
sea
,
they
be
bring
out
and
exhibit
to
the
rage
weather
,
which
they
never
fail
to
calm
.
 
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
connection
of
Saint
John
with
the
city
,
great
number
of
the
common
people
be
christen
Giovanni
Baptista
,
which
latter
name
be
pronounce
in
the
genoese
patois
"
Batcheetcha
,
"
like
a
sneeze
.
 
<EOS>
to
hear
everybody
call
everybody
else
Batcheetcha
,
on
a
Sunday
,
or
festa
-
day
,
when
there
be
crowd
in
the
street
,
be
not
a
little
singular
and
amusing
to
a
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
the
narrow
lane
have
great
villa
open
into
them
,
whose
wall
(
outside
wall
,
I
mean
)
be
profusely
paint
with
all
sort
of
subject
,
grim
and
holy
.
 
<EOS>
but
time
and
the
sea
-
air
have
nearly
obliterate
them
;
and
they
look
like
the
entrance
to
Vauxhall
Gardens
on
a
sunny
day
.
 
<EOS>
the
court
-
yard
of
these
house
be
overgrow
with
grass
and
weed
;
all
sort
of
hideous
patch
cover
the
basis
of
the
statue
,
as
if
they
be
afflict
with
a
cutaneous
disorder
;
the
outer
gate
be
rusty
;
and
the
iron
bar
outside
the
low
window
be
all
tumble
down
.
 
<EOS>
Firewood
be
keep
in
hall
where
costly
treasure
may
be
heap
up
,
mountain
high
;
waterfall
be
dry
and
choke
;
fountain
,
too
dull
to
play
,
and
too
lazy
to
work
,
have
just
enough
recollection
of
their
identity
,
in
their
sleep
,
to
make
the
neighbourhood
damp
;
and
the
sirocco
wind
be
often
blow
over
all
these
thing
for
day
together
,
like
a
gigantic
oven
out
for
a
holiday
.
  
<EOS>
not
long
ago
,
there
be
a
festa
-
day
,
in
honour
of
the
VIRGIN
's
MOTHER
,
when
the
young
man
of
the
neighbourhood
,
have
wear
green
wreath
of
the
vine
in
some
procession
or
other
,
bathe
in
them
,
by
score
.
 
<EOS>
It
look
very
odd
and
pretty
.
 
<EOS>
though
I
be
bind
to
confess
(
not
know
of
the
festa
at
that
time
)
,
that
I
think
,
and
be
quite
satisfied
,
they
wear
them
as
horse
do
---
to
keep
the
fly
off
.
  
<EOS>
soon
afterwards
,
there
be
another
festa
-
day
,
in
honour
of
St
Nazaro
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
the
Albaro
young
man
bring
two
large
bouquet
soon
after
breakfast
,
and
come
up
-
stair
into
the
great
SALA
,
present
them
himself
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
polite
way
of
beg
for
a
contribution
towards
the
expense
of
some
music
in
the
Saint
's
honour
,
so
we
give
him
whatever
it
may
have
be
,
and
his
messenger
depart
:
 
<EOS>
well
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
at
six
o'clock
in
the
evening
we
go
to
the
church
---
close
at
hand
---
a
very
gaudy
place
,
hang
all
over
with
festoon
and
bright
drapery
,
and
fill
,
from
the
altar
to
the
main
door
,
with
woman
,
all
seat
.
 
<EOS>
They
wear
no
bonnet
here
,
simply
a
long
white
veil
---
the
"
mezzero
;
"
and
it
be
the
most
gauzy
,
ethereal
-
look
audience
I
ever
see
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
woman
be
not
generally
pretty
,
but
they
walk
remarkably
well
,
and
in
their
personal
carriage
and
the
management
of
their
veil
,
display
much
innate
grace
and
elegance
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
some
man
present
:
 
not
very
many
:
 
and
a
few
of
these
be
kneel
about
the
aisle
,
while
everybody
else
tumble
over
them
.
 
<EOS>
innumerable
taper
be
burn
in
the
church
;
the
bit
of
silver
and
tin
about
the
saint
(
especially
in
the
Virgin
's
necklace
)
sparkle
brilliantly
;
the
priest
be
seat
about
the
chief
altar
;
the
organ
play
away
,
lustily
,
and
a
full
band
do
the
like
;
while
a
conductor
,
in
a
little
gallery
opposite
to
the
band
,
hammer
away
on
the
desk
before
him
,
with
a
scroll
;
and
a
tenor
,
without
any
voice
,
sing
.
<EOS>
the
band
play
one
way
,
the
organ
play
another
,
the
singer
go
a
third
,
and
the
unfortunate
conductor
bang
and
bang
,
and
flourish
his
scroll
on
some
principle
of
his
own
:
 
apparently
well
satisfied
with
the
whole
performance
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
do
hear
such
a
discordant
din
.
 
<EOS>
the
heat
be
intense
all
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
the
man
,
in
red
cap
,
and
with
loose
coat
hang
on
their
shoulder
(
they
never
put
them
on
)
,
be
play
bowl
,
and
buy
sweetmeat
,
immediately
outside
the
church
.
 
<EOS>
when
half
-
a
-
dozen
of
them
finish
a
game
,
they
come
into
the
aisle
,
cross
themselves
with
the
holy
water
,
knelt
on
one
knee
for
an
instant
,
and
walk
off
again
to
play
another
game
at
bowl
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
remarkably
expert
at
this
diversion
,
and
will
play
in
the
stony
lane
and
street
,
and
on
the
most
uneven
and
disastrous
ground
for
such
a
purpose
,
with
as
much
nicety
as
on
a
billiard
-
table
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
most
favourite
game
be
the
national
one
of
Mora
,
which
they
pursue
with
surprising
ardour
,
and
at
which
they
will
stake
everything
they
possess
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
destructive
kind
of
gambling
,
require
no
accessory
but
the
ten
finger
,
which
be
always
---
<EOS>
I
intend
no
pun
---
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
two
man
play
together
.
 
<EOS>
one
call
a
number
---
say
the
extreme
one
,
ten
.
 
<EOS>
He
mark
what
portion
of
it
he
please
by
throw
out
three
,
or
four
,
or
five
finger
;
and
his
adversary
have
,
in
the
same
instant
,
at
hazard
,
and
without
see
his
hand
,
to
throw
out
as
many
finger
,
as
will
make
the
exact
balance
.
<EOS>
Their
eye
and
hand
become
so
used
to
this
,
and
act
with
such
astonishing
rapidity
,
that
an
uninitiated
bystander
would
find
it
very
difficult
,
if
not
impossible
,
to
follow
the
progress
of
the
game
.
 
<EOS>
the
initiate
,
however
,
of
whom
there
be
always
an
eager
group
look
on
,
devour
it
with
the
most
intense
avidity
;
and
as
they
be
always
ready
to
champion
one
side
or
the
other
in
case
of
a
dispute
,
and
be
frequently
divide
in
their
partisanship
,
it
be
often
a
very
noisy
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
never
the
quiet
game
in
the
world
;
for
the
number
be
always
call
in
a
loud
sharp
voice
,
and
follow
as
close
upon
each
other
as
they
can
be
count
.
 
<EOS>
on
a
holiday
evening
,
stand
at
a
window
,
or
walk
in
a
garden
,
or
pass
through
the
street
,
or
saunter
in
any
quiet
place
about
the
town
,
you
will
hear
this
game
in
progress
in
a
score
of
wine
-
shop
at
once
;
and
look
over
any
vineyard
walk
,
or
turn
almost
any
corner
,
will
come
upon
a
knot
of
player
in
full
cry
.
<EOS>
It
be
observable
that
most
man
have
a
propensity
to
throw
out
some
particular
number
oftener
than
another
;
and
the
vigilance
with
which
two
sharp
-
eyed
player
will
mutually
endeavour
to
detect
this
weakness
,
and
adapt
their
game
to
it
,
be
very
curious
and
entertaining
.
 
<EOS>
the
effect
be
greatly
heighten
by
the
universal
suddenness
and
vehemence
of
gesture
;
two
man
play
for
half
a
farthing
with
an
intensity
as
all

absorb
as
if
the
stake
be
life

<EOS>
I
walk
into
its

precinct
the

evening
about
sunset

could
not

young

lady
vocalist
,
practise
bravura
lustily
,
come
flaunt
out
upon
the
silent
evening
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
down
into
the
garden
,
intend
to
be
prim
and
quaint
,
with
avenue
,
and
terrace
,
and
orange
-
tree
,
and
statue
,
and
water
in
stone
basin
;
and
everything
be
green
,
gaunt
,
weedy
,
straggle
,
under
grow
or
over
grown
,
mildewy
,
damp
,
redolent
of
all
sort
of
slabby
,
clammy
,
creep
,
and
uncomfortable
life
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
bright
in
the
whole
scene
but
a
firefly
---
one
solitary
firefly
---
show
against
the
dark
bush
like
the
last
little
speck
of
the
depart
Glory
of
the
house
;
and
even
it
go
flit
up
and
down
at
sudden
angle
,
and
leave
a
place
with
a
jerk
,
and
describe
an
irregular
circle
,
and
return
to
the
same
place
with
a
twitch
that
startle
one
:
 
as
if
it
be
look
for
the
rest
of
the
Glory
,
and
wonder
(
Heaven
know
it
may
!
)
<EOS>
what
have
become
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
two
month
,
the
flit
shape
and
shadow
of
my
dismal
enter
reverie
gradually
resolve
themselves
into
familiar
form
and
substance
;
and
I
already
begin
to
think
that
when
the
time
should
come
,
a
year
hence
,
for
close
the
long
holiday
and
turn
back
to
England
,
I
may
part
from
Genoa
with
anything
but
a
glad
heart
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
place
that
"
grow
upon
you
"
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
there
seem
to
be
always
something
to
find
out
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
most
extraordinary
alley
and
by
-
way
to
walk
about
in
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
lose
your
way
(
what
a
comfort
that
be
,
when
you
be
idle
!
)
<EOS>
twenty
time
a
day
,
if
you
like
;
and
turn
up
again
,
under
the
most
unexpected
and
surprising
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
It
abound
in
the
strange
contrast
;
thing
that
be
picturesque
,
ugly
,
mean
,
magnificent
,
delightful
,
and
offensive
,
break
upon
the
view
at
every
turn
.
  
<EOS>
They
who
would
know
how
beautiful
the
country
immediately
surround
Genoa
be
,
should
climb
(
in
clear
weather
)
to
the
top
of
Monte
Faccio
,
or
,
at
least
,
ride
round
the
city
wall
:
 
a
feat
more
easily
perform
.
 
<EOS>
no
prospect
can
be
more
diversified
and
lovely
than
the
change
view
of
the
harbour
,
and
the
valley
of
the
two
river
,
the
Polcevera
and
the
Bizagno
,
from
the
height
along
which
the
strongly
fortify
wall
be
carry
,
like
the
great
wall
of
China
in
little
.
 
<EOS>
in
not
the
least
picturesque
part
of
this
ride
,
there
be
a
fair
speciman
of
a
real
genoese
tavern
,
where
the
visitor
may
derive
good
entertainment
from
real
genoese
dish
,
such
as
Tagliarini
;
ravioli
;
german
sausage
,
strong
of
garlic
,
slice
and
eat
with
fresh
green
fig
;
cock
'
comb
and
sheep
-
kidney
,
chop
up
with
mutton
chop
and
liver
;
small
piece
of
some
unknown
part
of
a
calf
,
twist
into
small
shred
,
fry
,
and
serve
up
in
a
great
dish
like
white
-
bait
;
and
other
curiosity
of
that
kind
.
 
<EOS>
They
often
get
wine
at
these
suburban
Trattorie
,
from
France
and
Spain
and
Portugal
,
which
be
bring
over
by
small
captain
in
little
trading
-
vessel
.
 
<EOS>
They
buy
it
at
so
much
a
bottle
,
without
ask
what
it
be
,
or
care
to
remember
if
anybody
tell
them
,
and
usually
divide
it
into
two
heap
;
of
which
they
label
one
Champagne
,
and
the
other
Madeira
.
 
<EOS>
the
various
opposite
flavour
,
quality
,
country
,
age
,
and
vintage
that
be
comprise
under
these
two
general
head
be
quite
extraordinary
.
<EOS>
the
most
limited
range
be
probably
from
cool
Gruel
up
to
old
Marsala
,
and
down
again
to
apple
tea
.
  
<EOS>
the
great
majority
of
the
street
be
as
narrow
as
any
thoroughfare
can
well
be
,
where
people
(
even
italian
people
)
be
suppose
to
live
and
walk
about
;
be
mere
lane
,
with
here
and
there
a
kind
of
well
,
or
breathing
-
place
.
 
<EOS>
the
house
be
immensely
high
,
paint
in
all
sort
of
colour
,
and
be
in
every
stage
and
state
of
damage
,
dirt
,
and
lack
of
repair
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
commonly
let
off
in
floor
,
or
flat
,
like
the
house
in
the
old
town
of
Edinburgh
,
or
many
house
in
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
few
street
door
;
the
entrance
hall
be
,
for
the
most
part
,
look
upon
as
public
property
;
and
any
moderately
enterprising
scavenger
may
make
a
fine
fortune
by
now
and
then
clear
them
out
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
be
impossible
for
coach
to
penetrate
into
these
street
,
there
be
sedan
chair
,
gild
and
otherwise
,
for
hire
in
diver
place
.
 
<EOS>
a
great
many
private
chair
be
also
keep
among
the
nobility
and
gentry
;
and
at
night
these
be
trot
to
and
fro
in
all
direction
,
precede
by
bearer
of
great
lanthorn
,
make
of
linen
stretch
upon
a
frame
.
 
<EOS>
the
sedan
and
lanthorn
be
the
legitimate
successor
of
the
long
string
of
patient
and
much
-
abuse
mule
,
that
go
jingle
their
little
bell
through
these
confine
street
all
day
long
.
 
<EOS>
They
follow
them
,
as
regularly
as
the
star
the
sun
.
  
<EOS>
when
shall
I
forget
the
Streets
of
Palaces
:
 
<EOS>
the
Strada
Nuova
and
the
Strada
Balbi
!
<EOS>
or
how
the
former
look
one
summer
day
,
when
I
first
see
it
underneath
the
bright
and
most
intensely
blue
of
summer
sky
:
 
which
its
narrow
perspective
of
immense
mansion
,
reduce
to
a
tapering
and
most
precious
strip
of
brightness
,
look
down
upon
the
heavy
shade
below
!
 
<EOS>
a
brightness
not
too
common
,
even
in
July
and
August
,
to
be
well
esteem
:
 
for
,
if
the
Truth
must
out
,
there
be
not
eight
blue
sky
in
as
many
midsummer
week
,
saving
,
sometimes
,
early
in
the
morning
;
when
,
look
out
to
sea
,
the
water
and
the
firmament
be
one
world
of
deep
and
brilliant
blue
.
 
<EOS>
at
other
time
,
there
be
cloud
and
haze
enough
to
make
an
Englishman
grumble
in
his
own
climate
.
  
<EOS>
the
endless
detail
of
these
rich
Palaces
:
 
the
wall
of
some
of
them
,
within
,
alive
with
masterpiece
by
Vandyke
!
 
<EOS>
the
great

heavy

stone
balcony

one

and
tier

with
here
<EOS>
and
there

massively

low

immense

thick

,
strong

among
which
the

wander

as

the

still

steep

the
magnificent

innumerable

the
rapid
passage
from
a

of
stately

into
a
maze
of
the
vile
squalor
,
steam
with
unwholesome
stench
,
and
swarm
with
half

naked
child
and
whole
world
of
dirty
people

make
up
,
altogether
,
such
a
scene
of
wonder
:
 
so
lively

and
yet
so
dead
:
 
so
noisy
,
and
yet
so
quiet
:
 
so
obtrusive
,
and
yet
so
shy
and
lower
:
 
so
wide
awake
,
and
yet
so
fast
asleep
:
 
that
it
be
a
sort
of
intoxication
to
a
stranger
to
walk
on
,
and
on
,
and
on
,
and
look
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
a
bewilder
phantasmagoria
,
with
all
the
inconsistency
of
a
dream

and
all
the
pain
and
all
the
pleasure
of
an
extravagant
reality

<EOS>
the
different
use
to
which
some
of
these
palace
be
apply

all
at

be
characteristic

<EOS>
for
instance
,
the
English
Banker
(
my
excellent
and
hospitable
friend
)
have
his
office
in
a
good

sized
Palazzo
in
the
Strada

<EOS>
in
the
hall
(
every

<EOS>
on

the
Saracen

sell

sometimes

<EOS>
a

two

<EOS>
sometimes

they
be
visit
by
a

without

on
a

who
have
such

lively

such
a

well

condition
body

that
he
look

sink

ground
up

or
have
come

but
partially

up
a
flight

cellar

step

<EOS>
a
little
further
in

a
few
man
,
perhaps
,
lie
asleep
in
the
middle
of
the
day

or
they
may
be
chairman
wait
for
their
absent
freight

<EOS>
if
so

they
have
bring
their
chair
in

them

and
there
they
stand
also

<EOS>
on
the

<EOS>
on

be
the
english
bank

<EOS>
on
the
first
floor
also

be

whole
house

and
a
good
large
residence
too
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
know
what
there
may
be
above
that

but
when
you
be
there
,
you
have
only
just
begin
to
go
up

stair
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
,
come
down

stair
again
,
think
of
this
;
and
pass
out
at
a
great
crazy
door
in
the
back
of
the
hall
,
instead
of
turn
the
other
way
,
to
get
into
the
street
again
;
it
bang
behind
you
,
make
the
dismall
and
most
lonesome
echo
,
and
you
stand
in
a
yard
(
<EOS>
the
yard
of
the
same
house
)
which
seem
to
have
be
unvisited
by
human
foot
,
for
a
hundred
year

<EOS>
not
a

disturb
its
repose

<EOS>
not
a

thrust
out
of
any

the
grim

dark

jealous
window

within

make
the
weed
in
the
crack
pavement
faint

by

the
possibility

there
be

grub
them
up

<EOS>
opposite
to
you

be
a
giant
figure
carve
in
stone
,
recline

with
an
urn

upon
a
lofty
piece
of
artificial
rockwork

out

dangle
the

leaden
pipe

once

but
the

the
giant
be
not
dry

this
channel
be
now

<EOS>
He
seem
to
have
give
his
urn
,
which
be
nearly
upside
down
,
a
final
tilt
;
and
after
cry
,
like
a
sepulchral
child
,
"
all
go

"
<EOS>
to
have
lapse
into
a
stony
silence
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
street
of
shop
,
the
house
be
much
small
,
but
of
great
size
notwithstanding
,
and
extremely
high
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
very
dirty
:
quite
undrained
,
if
my
nose
be
at
all
reliable
:
 
and
emit
a
peculiar
fragrance
,
like
the
smell
of
very
bad
cheese
,
keep
in
very
hot
blanket
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
height
of
the
house
,
there
would
seem
to
have
be
a
lack
of
room
in
the
City
,
for
new
house
be
thrust
in
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
wherever
it
have
be
possible
to
cram
a
tumble

down
tenement
into
a
crack
or
corner
,
in
it
have
go
.
 
<EOS>
if
there
be
a
nook

angle
in
the
wall
of
a
church
,
or
a
crevice
in
any
other
dead
wall

of
any

there
you
be
sure
to
find
some
kind

habitation

look
as

grow
there

like
a
fungus

<EOS>
against
the
Government
House

against
the

Senate
House
,
round
about
any
large
building
,
little
shop
stick
so
close
,
like
parasite
vermin
to
the
great
carcase

<EOS>
and
for
all
this
,
look
where
you
may

up
step

down
step

anywhere

everywhere

there
be
irregular
house

recede

start
forward

cripple
themselves

by
some

until
one

more

choke
up

you

<EOS>
one
of
the
rottenest

look
part

that
its

have
stamp
it
deeper

<EOS>
here

again

the
house
be
very
high

and
be
of
an
infinite
variety
of
deformed
shape
,
and
have
(
as
most
of
the
house
have
)
something
hang
out
of
a
great
many
window
,
and
waft
its
frowsy
fragrance
on
the
breeze
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
it
be
a
curtain

sometimes

it
be
a
carpet
;
sometimes

it
be
a

sometimes

a

full

there
be
almost
always
something

the

every

MR

<EOS>
PEPYS
once
hear
a
clergyman
assert
in
his
sermon
,
in
illustration
of
his
respect
for
the
Priestly
office
,
that
if
he
could
meet
a
Priest
and
angel
together
,
he
would
salute
the
Priest
first
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
rather
of
the
opinion
of
PETRARCH
,
who
,
when
his
pupil
BOCCACCIO
write
to
him
in
great
tribulation
,
that
he
have
be
visit
and
admonish
for
his
writing
by
a
Carthusian
Friar
who
claim
to
be
a
messenger
immediately
commission
by
Heaven
for
that
purpose
,
reply
,
that
for
his
own
part
,
he
would
take
the
liberty
of
test
the
reality
of
the
commission
by
personal
observation
of
the
Messenger
's
face
,
eye
,
forehead
,
behaviour
,
and
discourse
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
but
believe
myself
,
from
similar
observation
,
that
many
unaccredite
celestial
messenger
may
be
see
skulk
through
the
street
of
Genoa
,
or
drone
away
their
life
in
other
italian
town
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
the
Cappuccini
,
though
not
a
learn
body
,
be
,
as
an
order
,
the
good
friend
of
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
They
seem
to
mingle
with
them
more
immediately
,
as
their
counsellor
and
comforter
;
and
to
go
among
them
more
,
when
they
be
sick
;
and
to
pry
less
than
some
other
order
,
into
the
secret
of
family
,
for
the
purpose
of
establish
a
baleful
ascendency
over
their
weak
member
;
and
to
be
influence
by
a
less
fierce
desire
to
make
convert
,
and
once
make
,
to
let
them
go
to
ruin
,
soul
and
body
.
 
<EOS>
They
may
be
see
,
in
their
coarse
dress
,
in
all
part
of
the
town
at
all
time
,
and
beg
in
the
market
early
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
the
Jesuits
too
,
muster
strong
in
the
street
,
and
go
slink
noiselessly
about
,
in
pair
,
like
black
cat
.
  
<EOS>
in
some
of
the
narrow
passage
,
distinct
trade
congregate
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
street
of
jeweller
,
and
there
be
a
row
of
bookseller
;
but
even
down
in
place
where
nobody
ever
can
,
or
ever
could
,
penetrate
in
a
carriage
,
there
be
mighty
old
palace
shut
in
among
the
gloomy
and
close
wall
,
and
almost
shut
out
from
the
sun
.
<EOS>
very
few
of
the
tradesman
have
any
idea
of
set
forth
their
good
,
or
dispose
them
for
show
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
,
a
stranger
,
want
to
buy
anything
,
you
usually
look
round
the
shop
till
you
see
it
;
then
clutch
it
,
if
it
be
within
reach
,
and
inquire
how
much
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
be
sell
at
the
most
unlikely
place
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
want
coffee
,
you
go
to
a
sweetmeat
shop
;
and
if
you
want
meat
,
you
will
probably
find
it
behind
an
old
check
curtain
,
down
half
-
a
-
dozen
step
,
in
some
sequester
nook
as
hard
to
find
as
if
the
commodity
be
poison
,
and
Genoa
's
law
be
death
to
any
that
utter
it
.
  
<EOS>
Most
of
the
apothecary
'
shop
be
great
lounging

place
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
grave
man
with
stick
,
sit
down
in
the
shade
for
hour
together
,
pass
a
meagre
Genoa
paper
from
hand
to
hand
,
and
talk
,
drowsily
and
sparingly
,
about
the
News
.
 
<EOS>
two
or
three
of
these
be
poor
physician
,
ready
to
proclaim
themselves
on
an
emergency
,
and
tear
off
with
any
messenger
who
may
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
know
them
by
the
way
in
which
they
stretch
their
neck
to
listen
,
when
you
enter
;
and
by
the
sigh
with
which
they
fall
back
again
into
their
dull
corner
,
on
find
that
you
only
want
medicine
.
 
<EOS>
few
people
lounge
in
the
barber
'
shop
;
though
they
be
very
numerous
,
as
hardly
any
man
shave
himself
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
apothecary
's
have
its
group
of
lounger
,
who
sit
back
among
the
bottle
,
with
their
hand
fold
over
the
top
of
their
stick
.
 
<EOS>
so
still
and
quiet
,
that
either
you
do
not
see
them
in
the
darken
shop
,
or
mistake
them
---
as
I
do
one
ghostly
man
in
bottle
-
green
,
one
day
,
with
a
hat
like
a
stopper
---
for
Horse
Medicine
.
  
<EOS>
on
a
summer
evening
the
Genoese
be
as
fond
of
put
themselves
,
as
their
ancestor
be
of
put
house
,
in
every
available
inch
of
space
in
and
about
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
in
all
the
lane
and
alley
,
and
up
every
little
ascent
,
and
on
every
dwarf
wall
,
and
on
every
flight
of
step
,
they
cluster
like
bee
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
(
and
especially
on
festa
-
day
)
<EOS>
the
bell
of
the
church
re
incessantly
;
not
in
peal
,
or
any
know
form
of
sound
,
but
in
a
horrible
,
irregular
,
jerking
,
dingle
,
dingle
,
dingle
:
 
with
a
sudden
stop
at
every
fifteenth
dingle
or
so
,
which
be
madden
.
 
<EOS>
this
performance
be
usually
achieve
by
a
boy
up
in
the
steeple
,
who
take
hold
of
the
clapper
,
or
a
little
rope
attach
to
it
,
and
try
to
dingle
louder
than
every
other
boy
similarly
employ
.
 
<EOS>
the
noise
be
suppose
to
be
particularly
obnoxious
to
evil
spirit
;
but
look
up
into
the
steeple
,
and
see
(
and
hear
)
<EOS>
these
young
Christians
thus
engage
,
one
may
very
naturally
mistake
them
for
the
Enemy
.
  
<EOS>
Festa
-
day
,
early
in
the
autumn
,
be
very
numerous
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
shop
be
shut
up
,
twice
within
a
week
,
for
these
holiday
;
and
one
night
,
all
the
house
in
the
neighbourhood
of
a
particular
church
be
illuminate
,
while
the
church
itself
be
light
,
outside
,
with
torch
;
and
a
grove
of
blaze
link
be
erect
,
in
an
open
space
outside
one
of
the
city
gate
.
 
<EOS>
this
part
of
the
ceremony
be
pretty
and
more
singular
a
little
way
in
the
country
,
where
you
can
trace
the
illuminate
cottage
all
the
way
up
a
steep
hill
-
side
;
and
where
you
pass
festoon
of
taper
,
waste
away
in
the
starlight
night
,
before
some
lonely
little
house
upon
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
on
these
day
,
they
always
dress
the
church
of
the
saint
in
whose
honour
the
festa
be
holden
,
very
gaily
.
 
<EOS>
gold
-
embroider
festoon
of
different
colour
,
hang
from
the
arch
;
the
altar
furniture
be
set
forth
;
and
sometimes
,
even
the
lofty
pillar
be
swathe
from
top
to
bottom
in
tight
-
fit
drapery
.
 
<EOS>
the
cathedral
be
dedicated
to
St
Lorenzo
.
 
<EOS>
on
St
Lorenzo
's
day
,
we
go
into
it
,
just
as
the
sun
be
set
.
 
<EOS>
although
these
decoration
be
usually
in
very
indifferent
taste
,
the
effect
,
just
then
,
be
very
superb
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
whole
building
be
dress
in
red
;
and
the
sink
sun
,
stream
in
,
through
a
great
red
curtain
in
the
chief
doorway
,
make
all
the
gorgeousness
its
own
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
sun
go
down
,
and
it
gradually
grow
quite
dark
inside
,
except
for
a
few
twinkle
taper
on
the
principal
altar
,
and
some
small
dangle
silver
lamp
,
it
be
very
mysterious
and
effective
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
sit
in
any
of
the
church
towards
evening
,
be
like
a
mild
dose
of
opium
.
  
<EOS>
with
the
money
collect
at
a
festa
,
they
usually
pay
for
the
dressing
of
the
church
,
and
for
the
hiring
of
the
band
,
and
for
the
taper
.
 
<EOS>
if
there
be
any
left
(
which
seldom
happen
,
I
believe
)
,
the
soul
in
Purgatory
get
the
benefit
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
also
suppose
to
have
the
benefit
of
the
exertion
of
certain
small
boy
,
who
shake
money
-
box
before
some
mysterious
little
building
like
rural
turnpike
,
which
(
usually
shut
up
close
)
fly
open
on
Red
-
letter
day
,
and
disclose
an
image
and
some
flower
inside
.
  
<EOS>
just
without
the
city
gate
,
on
the
Albara
road
,
be
a
small
house
,
with
an
altar
in
it
,
and
a
stationary
money
-
box
:
 
also
for
the
benefit
of
the
soul
in
Purgatory
.
 
<EOS>
still
further
to
stimulate
the
charitable
,
there
be
a
monstrous
painting
on
the
plaster
,
on
either
side
of
the
grate
door
,
represent
a
select
party
of
soul
,
fry
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
them
have
a
grey
moustache
,
and
an
elaborate
head
of
grey
hair
:
 
as
if
he
have
be
take
out
of
a
hairdresser
's
window
and
cast
into
the
furnace
.
 
<EOS>
there
he
be
:
 
a
most
grotesque
and
hideously
comic
old
soul
:
 
for
ever
blister
in
the
real
sun
,
and
melt
in
the
mimic
fire
,
for
the
gratification
and
improvement
(
and
the
contribution
)
of
the
poor
Genoese
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
not
a
very
joyous
people
,
and
be
seldom
see
to
dance
on
their
holiday
:
 
the
staple
place
of
entertainment
among
the
woman
,
be
the
church
and
the
public
walk
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
very
good
-
temper
,
obliging
,
and
industrious
.
 
<EOS>
industry
have
not
make
them
clean
,
for
their
habitation
be
extremely
filthy
,
and
their
usual
occupation
on
a
fine
Sunday
morning
,
be
to
sit
at
their
door
,
hunt
in
each
other
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
but
their
dwelling
be
so
close
and
confine
that
if
those
part
of
the
city
have
be
beat
down
by
Massena
in
the
time
of
the
terrible
Blockade
,
it
would
have
at
least
occasion
one
public
benefit
among
many
misfortune

<EOS>
the
Peasant
Women
,
with
naked
foot
and
leg
,
be
so
constantly
wash
clothe
,
in
the
public
tank
,
and
in
every
stream
and
ditch
,
that
one
can
not
help
wonder
,
in
the
midst
of
all
this
dirt
,
who
wear
them
when
they
be
clean
.
 
<EOS>
the
custom
be
to
lay
the
wet
linen
which
be
be
operate
upon
,
on
a
smooth
stone
,
and
hammer
away
at
it
,
with
a
flat
wooden
mallet

<EOS>
this
they
do
,
as
furiously
as
if
they
be
revenge
themselves
on
dress
in
general
for
be
connect
with
the
fall
of
mankind

<EOS>
It
be
not
unusual
to
see
,
lie
on
the
edge
of
the
tank
at
these
time
,
or
on
another
flat
stone
,
an
unfortunate
baby
,
tightly
swathe
up
,
arm
and
leg
and
all
,
in
an
enormous
quantity
of
wrapper
,
so
that
it
be
unable
to
move
a
toe
or
finger
.
 
<EOS>
this
custom
(
which
we
often
see
represent
in
old
picture
)
be
universal
among
the
common
people
.
 
<EOS>
a
child
be
leave
anywhere
without
the
possibility
of
crawl
away
,
or
be
accidentally
knock
off
a
shelf

or
tumble
out
of
bed

be
hang
up
to
a
hook
now

then

dangle

<EOS>
I
be
sit
,
one
Sunday
,
soon
after
my
arrival
,
in
the
little
country
church
of
San
Martino
,
a
couple
of
mile
from
the
city
,
while
a
baptism
take
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
priest
,
and
an
attendant
with
a
large
taper
,
and
a
man
,
and
a
woman
,
and
some
other
;
but
I
have
no
more
idea
,
until
the
ceremony
be
all
over
,
that
it
be
a
baptism
,
or
that
the
curious
little
stiff
instrument
,
that
be
pass
from
one
to
another
,
in
the
course
of
the
ceremony
,
by
the
handle
---
like
a
short
poker
---
be
a
child
,
than
I
have
that
it
be
my
own
christening
.
 
<EOS>
I
borrow
the
child
afterwards
,
for
a
minute
or
two
<EOS>
(
it
be
lie
across
the
font
then
)
,
and
find
it
very
red
in
the
face
but
perfectly
quiet
,
and
not
to
be
bent
on
any
term
.
<EOS>
the
number
of
cripple
in
the
street
,
soon
cease
to
surprise
me
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
plenty
of
saint
'
and
Virgin
's
Shrines
,
of
course
;
generally
at
the
corner
of
street
.
 
<EOS>
the
favourite
memento
to
the
Faithful
,
about
Genoa
,
be
a
painting
,
represent
a
peasant
on
his
knee
,
with
a
spade
and
some
other
agricultural
implement
beside
him
;
and
the
Madonna
,
with
the
Infant
Saviour
in
her
arm
,
appear
to
him
in
a
cloud
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
legend
of
the
Madonna
della
Guardia
:
 
a
chapel
on
a
mountain
within
a
few
mile
,
which
be
in
high
repute
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
that
this
peasant
live
all
alone
by
himself
,
till
some
land
atop
of
the
mountain
,
<EOS>
where
,
be
a
devout
man
,
he
daily
say
his
prayer
to
the
Virgin
in
the
open
air
;
for
his
hut
be
a
very
poor
one
.
 
<EOS>
upon
a
certain
day
,
the
Virgin
appear
to
him
,
as
in
the
picture
,
and
say
,
"
why
do
you
pray
in
the
open
air
,
and
without
a
priest
?
"
 
<EOS>
the
peasant
explain
because
there
be
neither
priest
nor
church
at
hand
---
a
very
uncommon
complaint
indeed
in
Italy
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
wish
,
then
,
"
say
the
Celestial
Visitor
,
"
to
have
a
chapel
build
here
,
in
which
the
prayer
of
the
Faithful
may
be
offer
up
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
Santissima
Madonna
,
"
say
the
peasant
,
"
I
be
a
poor
man
;
and
chapel
can
not
be
build
without
money
.
 
<EOS>
They
must
be
support
,
too
,
Santissima
;
for
to
have
a
chapel
and
not
support
it
liberally
,
be
a
wickedness
---
a
deadly
sin
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
sentiment
give
great
satisfaction
to
the
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
"
go
!
"
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
such
a
village
in
the
valley
on
the
left
,
and
such
another
village
in
the
valley
on
the
right
,
and
such
another
village
elsewhere
,
that
will
gladly
contribute
to
the
building
of
a
chapel
.
 
<EOS>
go
to
them
!
 
<EOS>
relate
what
you
have
see
;
and
do
not
doubt
that
sufficient
money
will
be
forthcoming
to
erect
my
chapel
,
or
that
it
will
,
afterwards
,
be
handsomely
maintain
.
<EOS>
"
all
of
which
(
miraculously
)
turn
out
to
be
quite
true
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
proof
of
this
prediction
and
revelation
,
there
be
the
chapel
of
the
Madonna
della
Guardia
,
rich
and
flourish
at
this
day
.
  
<EOS>
the
splendour
and
variety
of
the
genoese
church
,
can
hardly
be
exaggerate
.
 
<EOS>
the
church
of
the
Annunciata
especially
:
 
build
,
like
many
of
the
other
,
at
the
cost
of
one
noble
family
,
and
now
in
slow
progress
of
repair
:
 
from
the
outer
door
to
the
utmost
height
of
the
high
cupola
,
be
so
elaborately
paint
and
set
in
gold
,
that
it
look
(
as
SIMOND
describe
it
,
in
his
charming
book
on
Italy
)
like
a
great
enamel
snuff
-
box
.
 
<EOS>
Most
of
the
rich
church
contain
some
beautiful
picture
,
or
other
embellishment
of
great
price
,
almost
universally
set
,
side
by
side
,
with
sprawl
effigy
of
maudlin
monk
,
and
the
veri
trash
and
tinsel
ever
see
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
a
consequence
of
the
frequent
direction
of
the
popular
mind
,
and
pocket
,
to
the
soul
in
Purgatory
,
but
there
be
very
little
tenderness
for
the
body
of
the
dead
here
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
very
poor
,
there
be
,
immediately
outside
one
angle
of
the
wall
,
and
behind
a
jutting
point
of
the
fortification
,
near
the
sea
,
certain
common
pit
---
one
for
every
day
in
the
year
---
which
all
remain
closed
up
,
until
the
turn
of
each
come
for
its
daily
reception
of
dead
body
.
 
<EOS>
among
the
troop
in
the
town
,
there
be
usually
some
Swiss
:
 
more
or
less
.
 
<EOS>
when
any
of
these
die
,
they
be
bury
out
of
a
fund
maintain
by
such
of
their
countryman
as
be
resident
in
Genoa
.
 
<EOS>
Their
provide
coffin
for
these
man
be
matter
of
great
astonishment
to
the
authority
.
  
<EOS>
certainly
,
the
effect
of
this
promiscuous
and
indecent
splash
down
of
dead
people
in
so
many
well
,
be
bad
.
 
<EOS>
It
surround
death
with
revolt
association
,
that
insensibly
become
connected
with
those
whom
death
be
approach
.
 
<EOS>
indifference
and
avoidance
be
the
natural
result
;
and
all
the
soften
influence
of
the
great
sorrow
be
harshly
disturb
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
ceremony
when
an
old
Cavaliere
or
the
like
,
expire
,
of
erect
a
pile
of
bench
in
the
cathedral
,
to
represent
his
bi
;
cover
them
over
with
a
pall
of
black
velvet
;
put
his
hat
and
sword
on
the
top
;
make
a
little
square
of
seat
about
the
whole
;
and
send
out
formal
invitation
to
his
friend
and
acquaintance
to
come
and
sit
there
,
and
hear
Mass
:
 
which
be
perform
at
the
principal
Altar
,
decorate
with
an
infinity
of
candle
for
that
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
well
kind
of
people
die
,
or
be
at
the
point
of
death
,
their
near
relation
generally
walk
off
:
 
retire
into
the
country
for
a
little
change
,
and
leave
the
body
to
be
dispose
of
,
without
any
superintendence
from
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
procession
be
usually
form
,
and
the
coffin
borne
,
and
the
funeral
conduct
,
by
a
body
of
person
call
a
Confraternita
,
who
,
as
a
kind
of
voluntary
penance
,
undertake
to
perform
these
office
,
in
regular
rotation
,
for
the
dead
;
but
who
,
mingle
something
of
pride
with
their
humility
,
be
dress
in
a
loose
garment
cover
their
whole
person
,
and
wear
a
hood
conceal
the
face
;
with
breathing
-
hole
and
aperture
for
the
eye
.
 
<EOS>
the
effect
of
this
costume
be
very
ghastly
:
 
especially
in
the
case
of
a
certain
Blue
Confraternita
belong
to
Genoa
,
who
,
to
say
the
least
of
them
,
be
very
ugly
customer
,
and
who
look
---
suddenly
encounter
in
their
pious
ministration
in
the
street
---
as
if
they
be
Ghoules
or
Demons
,
bear
off
the
body
for
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
although
such
a
custom
may
be
liable
to
the
abuse
attendant
on
many
italian
custom
,
of
be
recognise
as
a
means
of
establish
a
current
account
with
Heaven
,
on
which
to
draw
,
too
easily
,
for
future
bad
action
,
or
as
an
expiation
for
past
misdeed
,
it
must
be
admit
to
be
a
good
one
,
and
a
practical
one
,
and
one
involve
unquestionably
good
work
.
 
<EOS>
a
voluntary
service
like
this
,
be
surely
well
than
the
impose
penance
(
not
at
all
an
infrequent
one
)
of
give
so
many
lick
to
such
and
such
a
stone
in
the
pavement
of
the
cathedral
;
or
than
a
vow
to
the
Madonna
to
wear
nothing
but
blue
for
a
year
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
suppose
to
give
great
delight
above

blue
be
(
as
be
well
know
)
the
Madonna
's
favourite
colour

<EOS>
woman
who
have
devote
themselves
to
this
act
of
Faith

be
very
commonly

<EOS>
there
be
three
theatre
in

an

<EOS>
the
most

---
<EOS>
the
Carlo

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
nothing
impress
me
,
so
much
,
in
my
visit
here
<EOS>
(
which
be
pretty
numerous
)
as
the
uncommonly
hard
and
cruel
character
of
the
audience
,
who
resent
the
slight
defect
,
take
nothing
good
-
humouredly
,
seem
to
be
always
lie
in
wait
for
an
opportunity
to
hiss
,
and
spare
the
actress
as
little
as
the
actor
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
as
there
be
nothing
else
of
a
public
nature
at
which
they
be
allow
to
express
the
least
disapprobation
,
perhaps
they
be
resolve
to
make
the
most
of
this
opportunity
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
number
of
piedmontese
officer
too
,
who
be
allow
the
privilege
of
kick
their
heel
in
the
pit
,
for
next

nothing

gratuitous

cheap
accommodation

by
the
Governor

in
all
public
or
semi

public
entertainment

<EOS>
They
be
lofty
critic
in
consequence
,
and
infinitely
more
exacting
than
if
they
make
the
unhappy

fortune

<EOS>
the
TEATRO
DIURNO
,
or
Day

the
performance
take

in

afternoon
;
commence
at
four
or
five
o'clock
,
and
last
,
some
three
hour

<EOS>
It
be
curious
,
sit
among
the
audience
,
to
have
a
fine
view
of
the
neighbouring
hill
and
house
,
and
to
see
the
neighbour
at
their
window
look
on
,
and
to
hear
the
bell
of
the
church
and
convent
ring
at
most
complete
cross

purpose
with
the
scene

<EOS>
beyond
this

and
the
novelty
of
see
a
play
in
the
fresh
pleasant
air
,
with
the
darkening
evening
close
in
,
there
be
nothing
very
exciting
or
characteristic
in
the
performance
.
 
<EOS>
the
actor
be
indifferent
;
and
though
they
sometimes
represent
one
of
Goldoni
's
comedy
,
the
staple
of
the
Drama
be
french

<EOS>
anything

the
Theatre
of
Puppets

Marionetti

a
famous
company

be
,
without
any
exception
,
the
droll
exhibition
I
ever
beheld
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
anything
so
exquisitely
ridiculous
.
 
<EOS>
They
look
between
four
and
five
foot
high
,
but
be
really
much
small
;
for
when
a
musician
in
the
orchestra
happen
to
put
his
hat
on
the
stage
,
it
become
alarmingly
gigantic
,
and
almost
blot
out
an
actor

They
usually
play
a
comedy

a
ballet

He

extra

with
which
he
wink
at
the
pit

in
a
manner
that
be
absolutely
insupportable
to
a
stranger

but
which
the
initiate
audience

mainly
compose
of
the
common

receive
(
so
they
do
everything
else

quite

His

be
prodigious

<EOS>
He
continually
shake
his

no

would
be
hard
to
say
why
;
for
Italians
have
little
cause
to
sympathise
with
Napoleon
,
Heaven
know
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
plot
at
all
,
except
that
a
french
officer
,
disguise
as
an
Englishman
,
come
to
propound
a
plan
of
escape
;
and
be
discover
,
but
not
before
Napoleon
have
magnanimously
refuse
to
steal
his
freedom
,
be
immediately
order
off
by
Low
to
be
hang
.
<EOS>
in
two
very
long
speech
,
which
Low
make
memorable
,
by
wind
up
with
"
Yas
!
"
---
to
show
that
he
be
English
---
which
bring
down
thunder
of
applause
.
 
<EOS>
Napoleon
be
so
affect
by
this
catastrophe
,
that
he
faint
away
on
the
spot
,
and
be
carry
out
by
two
other
puppet
.
 
<EOS>
judge
from
what
follow
,
it
would
appear
that
he
never
recover
the
shock
;
for
the
next
act
show
him
,
in
a
clean
shirt
,
in
his
bed
(
curtain
crimson
and
white
)
,
where
a
lady
,
prematurely
dress
in
mourning
,
bring
two
little
child
,
who
kneel
down
by
the
bedside
,
while
he
make
a
decent
end
;
the
last
word
on
his
lip
be
"
Vatterlo
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
unspeakably
ludicrous
.
 
<EOS>
Buonaparte
's
boot
be
so
wonderfully
beyond
control
,
and
do
such
marvellous
thing
of
their
own
accord
:
 
double
themselves
up
,
and
get
under
table
,
and
dangle
in
the
air
,
and
sometimes
skate
away
with
him
,
out
of
all
human
knowledge
,
when
he
be
in
full
speech
---
mischance
which
be
not
render
the
less
absurd
,
by
a
settle
melancholy
depict
in
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
to
put
an
end
to
one
conference
with
Low
,
he
have
to
go
to
a
table
,
and
read
a
book
:
 
when
it
be
the
fine
spectacle
I
ever
beheld
,
to
see
his
body
bend
over
the
volume
,
like
a
boot
-
jack
,
and
his
sentimental
eye
glare
obstinately
into
the
pit
.
<EOS>
He
be
prodigiously
good
,
in
bed
,
with
an
immense
collar
to
his
shirt
,
and
his
little
hand
outside
the
coverlet
.
 
<EOS>
so
be
Dr.
Antommarchi
,
represent
by
a
puppet
with
long
lank
hair
,
like
Mawworm
's
,
who
,
in
consequence
of
some
derangement
of
his
wire
,
hover
about
the
couch
like
a
vulture
,
and
give
medical
opinion
in
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
almost
as
good
as
Low
,
though
the
latter
be
great
at
all
time
---
a
decide
brute
and
villain
,
beyond
all
possibility
of
mistake
.
 
<EOS>
Low
be
especially
fine
at
the
last
,
when
,
hear
the
doctor
and
the
valet
say
,
"
the
Emperor
be
dead
!
"
<EOS>
he
pull
out
his
watch
,
and
wind
up
the
piece
(
not
the
watch
)
by
exclaim
,
with
characteristic
brutality
,
"
ha
!
ha
!
 
<EOS>
eleven
minute
to
six
!
 
<EOS>
the
General
dead
!
<EOS>
and
the
spy
hang
!
"
 
<EOS>
this
bring
the
curtain
down
,
triumphantly
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
not
in
Italy
,
they
say
(
<EOS>
and
I
believe
them
)
,
a
lovely
residence
than
the
Palazzo
Peschiere
,
or
Palace
of
the
Fishponds
,
whither
we
remove
as
soon
as
our
three
month
'
tenancy
of
the
Pink
Jail
at
Albaro
have
cease
and
determine
.
  
<EOS>
It
stand
on
a
height
within
the
wall
of
Genoa
,
but
aloof
from
the
town
:
 
surround
by
beautiful
garden
of
its
own

adorn
with
statue
,
vase
,
fountain
,
marble
basin
,
terrace
,
walk
of
orange

tree
and
lemon

tree
,
grove
of
rose
and
camellias
.
 
<EOS>
all
its
apartment
be
beautiful
in
their
proportion
and
decoration
;
but
the
great
hall
,
some
fifty
foot
in
height
,
with
three
large
window
at
the
end
,
overlook
the
whole
town
of
Genoa
,
the
harbour
,
and
the
neighbouring
sea
,
afford
one
of
the
most
fascinating
and
delightful
prospect
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
any
house
more
cheerful
and
habitable
than
the
great
room
be
,
within
,
it
would
be
difficult
to
conceive
;
and
certainly
nothing
more
delicious
than
the
scene
without
,
in
sunshine
or
in
moonlight
,
could
be
imagine
.
<EOS>
It
be
more
like
an
enchanted
place
in
an
eastern
story
than
a
grave
and
sober
lodging
.
  
<EOS>
how
you
may
wander
on
,
from
room
to
room
,
and
never
tire
of
the
wild
fancy
on
the
wall
and
ceiling
,
as
bright
in
their
fresh
colouring
as
if
they
have
be
paint
yesterday
;
or
how
one
floor
,
or
even
the
great
hall
which
open
on
eight
other
room
,
be
a
spacious
promenade
;
or
how
there
be
corridor
and
bed
-
chamber
above
,
which
we
never
use
and
rarely
visit
,
and
scarcely
know
the
way
through
;
or
how
there
be
a
view
of
a
perfectly
different
character
on
each
of
the
four
side
of
the
building
;
matter
little

<EOS>
but
that
prospect
from
the
hall
be
like
a
vision
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
back
to
it
,
in
fancy
,
as
I
have
do
in
calm
reality
a
hundred
time
a
day
;
and
stand
there

look
out

with
the
sweet
scent

rise
up
about
me

in
a
perfect

<EOS>
there

in
beautiful
confusion

like
a
gallery

with
an
iron

where
sometimes
early
in
the
morning
,
I
have
see
a
little
group
of
dark

veiled
nun
glide
sorrowfully
to

fro

stop
now

very
odd

without
a
knowledge

the

their

change
so
suddenly
from
earnestness

odder

the

and
this

the

it
after
dark

think
it

<EOS>
My

many

have
cease

with
their
beautiful

to
blind
corner
of

where
it

<EOS>
the
steamer
have
come
from
Genoa
in
a
delicious
run
of
eighteen
hour

and
we

go
to
run
back
again
by
the
Cornice
road
from
Nice

not

to
have
see
only

picturesque
white

<EOS>
the
Boat
which
start

night

at
eight
o'clock

be
very
small

and
so
crowded
with
good
that
there

scarcely
room
to
move
;
neither
be
there
anything
to
cat
on
board
,
except
bread

nor

except
coffee

<EOS>
but
be
due
at
Nice
at
about
eight
or
so
in
the
morning
,
this
be
of
no
consequence

so
when
we
begin
to
wink
at
the
bright
star
,
in
involuntary
acknowledgment
of
their
winking
at
us

we
turn
into
our
berth

in

cool
little
cabin

soundly
till
morning

<EOS>
the
Boat
,
be
as
dull

dog
a
little
boat
as
ever
be
build
,
it
be
within
an
hour
of
noon
when
we
turn
into
Nice
Harbour
,
where
we
very
little
expect
anything
but
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
be
laden
with
wool
.
 
<EOS>
Wool
must
not
remain
in
the
Custom
-
house
at
Marseilles
more
than
twelve
month
at
a
stretch
,
without
pay
duty
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
custom
to
make
fictitious
removal
of
unsold
wool
to
evade
this
law
;
to
take
it
somewhere
when
the
twelve
month
be
nearly
out
;
bring
it
straight
back
again
;
and
warehouse
it
,
as
a
new
cargo
,
for
nearly
twelve
month
longer
.
 
<EOS>
this
wool
of
our
,
have
come
originally
from
some
place
in
the
East
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
recognise
as
Eastern
produce

the
moment
we
enter
the
harbour

<EOS>
accordingly
,
the
gay
little
Sunday
boat
,
full
of
holiday
people
,
which
have
come
off
to
greet
us
,
be
warn
away

we

in
quarantine

and
a
great
flag
be
solemnly
run
up
to
the
mast
-
head
on
the
wharf
,
to
make
it
known
to
all
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
hot
day
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
unshave
,
unwashed
,
undressed
,
unfed
,
and
could
hardly
enjoy
the
absurdity
of
lie
blistering
in
a
lazy
harbour
,
with
the
town
look
on
from
a
respectful
distance
,
all
manner
of
whiskered
man
in
cocked
hat
discuss
our
fate
at
a
remote
guard
-
house
,
with
gesture
(
we
look
very
hard
at
them
through
telescope
)
expressive
of
a
week
's
detention
at
least
:
 
and
nothing
whatever
the
matter
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
but
even
in
this
crisis
the
brave
Courier
achieve
a
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
He
telegraph
somebody
<EOS>
(
I
see
nobody
)
<EOS>
either
naturally
connect
with
the
hotel
,
or
put
EN
RAPPORT
with
the
establishment
for
that
occasion
only
.
 
<EOS>
the
telegraph
be
answer
,
and
in
half
an
hour
or
less
,
there
come
a
loud
shout
from
the
guard
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
the
captain

want

<EOS>
everybody
help
the
captain
into
his
boat
.
 
<EOS>
everybody
get
his
luggage
,
and
say
we
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
the
captain
row
away
,
and
disappear
behind
a
little
jut
corner
of
the
Galley
-
slave
'
prison
:
 
and
presently
come
back
with
something
,
very
sulkily
.
 
<EOS>
the
brave
Courier
meet
him
at
the
side
,
and
receive
the
something
as
its
rightful
owner
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
wicker
basket
,
fold
in
a
linen
cloth
;
and
in
it
be
two
great
bottle
of
wine
,
a
roast
fowl
,
some
salt
fish
chop
with
garlic
,
a
great
loaf
of
bread
,
a
dozen
or
so
of
peach
,
and
a
few
other
trifle
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
have
select
our
own
breakfast
,
the
brave
Courier
invite
a
choose
party
to
partake
of
these
refreshment
,
and
assure
them
that
they
need
not
be
deter
by
motive
of
delicacy
,
as
he
would
order
a
second
basket
to
be
furnish
at
their
expense
.
 
<EOS>
which
he
do
---
no
one
know
how
---
and
by
-
and
-
by
,
the
captain
be
again
summon
,
again
sulkily
return
with
another
something
;
over
which
my
popular
attendant
preside
as
before
:
 
<EOS>
carve
with
a
clasp
-
knife
,
his
own
personal
property
,
something
small
than
a
roman
sword
.
  
<EOS>
the
whole
party
on
board
be
make
merry
by
these
unexpected
supply
;
but
none
more
so
than
a
loquacious
little
Frenchman
,
who
get
drunk
in
five
minute
,
and
a
sturdy
Cappuccino
Friar
,
who
have
take
everybody
's
fancy
mightily
,
and
be
one
of
the
good
friar
in
the
world
,
I
verily
believe
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
a
free
,
open
countenance
;
and
a
rich
brown
,
flow
beard
;
and
be
a
remarkably
handsome
man
,
of
about
fifty

<EOS>
He
have
come
up
to
us
,
early
in
the
morning
,
and
inquire
whether
we
be
sure
to
be
at
Nice
by
eleven
;
say
that
he
particularly
want
to
know
,
because
if
we
reach
it
by
that
time
he
would
have
to
perform
Mass
,
and
must
deal
with
the
consecrated
wafer
,
fast
;
whereas
,
if
there
be
no
chance
of
his
being
in
time
,
he
would
immediately
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
this
communication
,
under
the
idea
that
the
brave
Courier
be
the
captain
;
and
indeed
he
look
much
more
like
it
than
anybody
else
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
be
assure
that
we
should
arrive
in
good
time
,
he
fast
,
and
talk
,
fast
,
to
everybody
,
with
the
most
charming
good
humour
;
answer
joke
at
the
expense
of
friar
,
with
other
joke
at
the
expense
of
layman
,
and
say
that
,
friar
as
he
be
,
he
would
engage
to
take
up
the
two
strong
man
on
board
,
one
after
the
other
,
with
his
tooth
,
and
carry
them
along
the
deck
.
 
<EOS>
nobody
give
him
the
opportunity
,
but
I
dare
say
he
could
have
do
it
;
for
he
be
a
gallant
,
noble
figure
of
a
man
,
even
in
the
Cappuccino
dress
,
which
be
the
ugly
and
most
ungainly
that
can
well
be
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
have
give
great
delight
to
the
loquacious
Frenchman
,
who
gradually
patronise
the
Friar
very
much
,
and
seem
to
commiserate
him
as
one
who
may
have
be
bear
a
Frenchman
himself
,
but
for
an
unfortunate
destiny
.
 
<EOS>
although
his
patronage
be
such
as
a
mouse
may
bestow
upon
a
lion
,
he
have
a
vast
opinion
of
its
condescension
;
and
in
the
warmth
of
that
sentiment
,
occasionally
rise
on
tiptoe
,
to
slap
the
Friar
on
the
back
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
basket
arrive
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
then
too
late
for
Mass
:
 
<EOS>
the
Friar
go
to
work
bravely
:
 
<EOS>
eat
prodigiously
of
the
cold
meat
and
bread
,
drink
deep
draught
of
the
wine
,
smoke
cigar
,
take
snuff
,
sustain
an
uninterrupted
conversation
with
all
hand
,
and
occasionally
run
to
the
boat
's
side
and
hail
somebody
on
shore
with
the
intelligence
that
we
MUST
be
get
out
of
this
quarantine
somehow
or
other
,
as
he
have
to
take
part
in
a
great
religious
procession
in
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
after
this
,
he
would
come
back
,
laugh
lustily
from
pure
good
humour
:
 
while
the
Frenchman
wrinkle
his
small
face
into
ten
thousand
crease
,
and
say
how
droll
it
be
,
and
what
a
brave
boy
be
that
Friar
!
 
<EOS>
at
length
the
heat
of
the
sun
without
,
and
the
wine
within
,
make
the
Frenchman
sleepy
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
in
the
noontide
of
his
patronage
of
his
gigantic
protege
,
he
lie
down
among
the
wool
,
and
begin
to
snore
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
four
o'clock
before
we
be
release
;
and
the
Frenchman
,
dirty
and
woolly
,
and
snuffy
,
be
still
sleep
when
the
Friar
go
ashore
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
we
be
free
,
we
all
hurry
away
,
to
wash
and
dress
,
that
we
may
make
a
decent
appearance
at
the
procession
;
and
I
see
no
more
of
the
Frenchman
until
we
take
up
our
station
in
the
main
street
to
see
it
pass
,
when
he
squeeze
himself
into
a
front
place
,
elaborately
renovate
;
throw
back
his
little
coat
,
to
show
a
broad
-
bar
velvet
waistcoat
,
sprinkle
all
over
with
star
;
then
adjust
himself
and
his
cane
so
as
utterly
to
bewilder
and
transfix
the
Friar
,
when
he
should
appear
.
  
<EOS>
the
procession
be
a
very
long
one
,
and
include
an
immense
number
of
people
divide
into
small
party
;
each
party
chant
nasally
,
on
its
own
account
,
without
reference
to
any
other
,
and
produce
a
most
dismal
result
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
angel
,
crosse
,
virgin
carry
on
flat
board
surround
by
cupid
,
crown
,
saint
,
missal
,
infantry
,
taper
,
monk
,
nun
,
relic
,
dignitary
of
the
church
in
green
hat
,
walk
under
crimson
parasol
:
 
and
,
here
and
there
,
a
species
of
sacred
street
-
lamp
hoist
on
a
pole
.
 
<EOS>
We
look
out
anxiously
for
the
Cappuccini
,
and
presently
their
brown
robe
and
cord
girdle
be
see
come
on
,
in
a
body
.
  
<EOS>
I
observe
the
little
Frenchman
chuckle
over
the
idea
that
when
the
Friar
see
him
in
the
broad
-
bar
waistcoat
,
he
would
mentally
exclaim
,
"
<EOS>
be
that
my
Patron
!
 
<EOS>
that
distinguished
man
!
"
and
would
be
cover
with
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
never
be
the
Frenchman
so
deceive
.
<EOS>
as
our
friend
the
Cappuccino
advance
,
with
fold
arm
,
he
look
straight
into
the
visage
of
the
little
Frenchman
,
with
a
bland
,
serene
,
compose
abstraction
,
not
to
be
describe
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
the
faint
trace
of
recognition
or
amusement
on
his
feature
;
not
the
small
consciousness
of
bread
and
meat
,
wine
,
snuff
,
or
cigar
.
 
<EOS>
"
c'
lui
-
meme
<EOS>
,
"
I
hear
the
little
Frenchman
say
,
in
some
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
oh
yes
,
it
be
himself
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
his
brother
or
his
nephew
,
very
like
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
he
.
 
<EOS>
He
walk
in
great
state
:
be
one
of
the
Superiors
of
the
order
:
 
and
look
his
part
to
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
there
never
be
anything
so
perfect
of
its
kind
as
the
contemplative
way
in
which
he
allow
his
placid
gaze
to
rest
on
us
,
<EOS>
his
late
companion
,
as
if
he
have
never
see
us
in
his
life
and
do
not
see
us
then
.
 
<EOS>
the
Frenchman
,
quite
humble
,
take
off
his
hat
at
last
,
but
the
Friar
still
pass
on
,
with
the
same
imperturbable
serenity
;
and
the
broad
-
bar
waistcoat
,
fade
into
the
crowd
,
be
see
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
the
procession
wind
up
with
a
discharge
of
musketry
that
shake
all
the
window
in
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
next
afternoon
we
start
for
Genoa
,
by
the
famed
Cornice
road
.
  
<EOS>
the
half
-
french
,
half
-
italian
Vetturino
,
who
undertake
,
with
his
little
rattling
carriage
and
pair
,
to
convey
us
thither
in
three
day
,
be
a
careless
,
good
-
look
fellow
,
whose
light
-
heartedness
and
singe
propensity
know
no
bound
as
long
as
we
go
on
smoothly
.
 
<EOS>
so
long
,
he
have
a
word
and
a
smile
,
and
a
flick
of
his
whip
,
for
all
the
peasant
girl
,
and
odd
and
end
of
the
Sonnambula
for
all
the
echo
.
 
<EOS>
so
long
,
he
go
jingle
through
every
little
village
,
with
bell
on
his
horse
and
ring
in
his
ear
:
 
a
very
meteor
of
gallantry
and
cheerfulness
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
it
be
highly
characteristic
to
see
him
under
a
slight
reverse
of
circumstance
,
when
,
in
one
part
of
the
journey
,
we
come
to
a
narrow
place
where
a
waggon
have
break
down
and
stop
up
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
His
hand
be
twine
in
his
hair
immediately
,
as
if
a
combination
of
all
the
dire
accident
in
life
have
suddenly
fall
on
his
devoted
head
.
 
<EOS>
He
swear
in
French
,
pray
in
Italian
,
and
go
up
and
down
,
beat
his
foot
on
the
ground
in
a
very
ecstasy
of
despair
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
various
carter
and
mule
-
driver
assemble
round
the
break
waggon
,
and
at
last
some
man
of
an
original
turn
of
mind
,
propose
that
a
general
and
joint
effort
should
be
make
to
get
thing
to
-
right
again
,
and
clear
the
way
---
an
idea
which
I
verily
believe
would
never
have
present
itself
to
our
friend
,
though
we
have
remain
there
until
now
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
do
at
no
great
cost
of
labour
;
but
at
every
pause
in
the
doing
,
his
hand
be
wind
in
his
hair
again
,
as
if
there
be
no
ray
of
hope
to
lighten
his
misery
.
 
<EOS>
the
moment
he
be
on
his
box
once
more
,
and
clatter
briskly
down
hill
<EOS>
,
he
return
to
the
Sonnambula
and
the
peasant
girl
,
as
if
it
be
not
in
the
power
of
misfortune
to
depress
him
.
  
<EOS>
much
of
the
romance
of
the
beautiful
town
and
village
on
this
beautiful
road
,
disappear
when
they
be
enter
,
for
many
of
them
be
very
miserable
.
 
<EOS>
the
street
be
narrow
,
dark
,
and
dirty
;
the
inhabitant
lean
and
squalid
;
and
the
withered
old
woman
,
with
their
wiry
grey
hair
twist
up
into
a
knot
on
the
top
of
the
head
,
like
a
pad
to
carry
load
on
,
be
so
intensely
ugly
,
both
along
the
Riviera
,
and
in
Genoa
,
too
,
that
,
see
straggle
about
in
dim
door
-
way
with
their
spindle
,
or
croon
together
in
by
-
corner
,
they
be
like
a
population
of
witch
---
except
that
they
certainly
be
not
to
be
suspect
of
broom
or
any
other
instrument
of
cleanliness
.
 
<EOS>
neither
be
the
pig
-
skin
,
in
common
use
to
hold
wine
,
and
hang
out
in
the
sun
in
all
direction
,
by
any
mean
ornamental
,
as
they
always
preserve
the
form
of
very
bloated
pig
,
with
their
head
and
leg
cut
off
,
dangle
upside
-
down
by
their
own
tail
.
  
<EOS>
these
town
,
as
they
be
see
in
the
approach
,
however

nestling
,
with
their
cluster
roof
and
tower
,
among
tree
on
steep
hill
-
side
,
or
build
upon
the
brink
of
noble
bay

be
charming
.
 
<EOS>
the
vegetation
be
,
everywhere
,
luxuriant
and
beautiful
,
and
the
palm
-
tree
make
a
novel
feature
in
the
novel
scenery
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
town
,
San
Remo
---
a
most
extraordinary
place
,
build
on
gloomy
open
arch
,
so
that
one
may
ramble
underneath
the
whole
town
---
there
be
pretty
terrace
garden
;
in
other
town
,
there
be
the
clang
of
shipwright
'
hammer
,
and
the
building
of
small
vessel
on
the
beach
.
 
<EOS>
in
some
of
the
broad
bay
,
the
fleet
of
Europe
may
ride
at
anchor
.
 
<EOS>
in
every
case
,
each
little
group
of
house
present
,
in
the
distance
,
some
enchanting
confusion
of
picturesque
and
fanciful
shape
.
  
<EOS>
the
road
itself
---
now
high
above
the
glitter
sea
,
which
break
against
the
foot
of
the
precipice
:
 
now
turn
inland
to
sweep
the
shore
of
a
bay
:
 
now
cross
the
stony
bed
of
a
mountain
stream
:
now
low
down
on
the
beach
:
 
now
wind
among
riven
rock
of
many
form
and
colour
:
 
now
chequer
by
a
solitary
ruin
tower
,
one
of
a
chain
of
tower
build
,
in
old
time
,
to
protect
the
coast
from
the
invasion
of
the
Barbary
Corsairs
---
present
new
beauty
every

<EOS>
when
its
own
striking
scenery
be
pass
,
and
it
trail
on
through
a
long
line
of
suburb
,
lie
on
the
flat
seashore
,
to
Genoa
,
then
,
the
change
glimpse
of
that
noble
city

awaken
a

of
interest
;
freshen
by
every
huge

unwieldy

half

inhabit
old
house
in
its
outskirt
:
 
and
come
to
its
climax
when
the
city
gate
be
reach

and
all
Genoa
with
its
beautiful
harbour
,
and
neighbouring
hill

burst
proudly
on

<EOS>
to
Parma

Modena

Bologna
 
<EOS>
I
stroll
away
from
Genoa
on
the
6th
of
November
,
bind
for
a
good
many
place
(
England
among
them
)
,
but
first
for
Piacenza
;
for
which
town
I
start
in
the
COUPE
of
a
machine
something
like
a
travel
caravan
,
in
company
with
the
brave
Courier
,
and
a
lady
with
a
large
dog
,
who
howl
dolefully
,
at
interval
,
all
night
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
wet
,
and
very
cold
;
very
dark
,
and
very
dismal
;
we
travel
at
the
rate
of
barely
four
mile
an
hour
,
and
stop
nowhere
for
refreshment
.
 
<EOS>
at
ten
o'clock
next
morning
,
we
change
coach
at
Alessandria
,
where
we
be
pack
up
in
another
coach
<EOS>
(
the
body
whereof
would
have
be
small
for
a
fly
)
,
in
company
with
a
very
old
priest
;
a
young
Jesuit
,
his
companion
---
who
carry
their
breviary
and
other
book
,
and
who
,
in
the
exertion
of
get
into
the
coach
,
have
make
a
gash
of
pink
leg
between
his
black
stocking
and
his
black
knee
-
short
,
that
remind
one
of
Hamlet
in
Ophelia
's
closet
,
only
it
be
visible
on
both
leg
---
a
provincial
Avvocato
;
and
a
gentleman
with
a
red
nose
that
have
an
uncommon
and
singular
sheen
upon
it
,
which
I
never
observe
in
the
human
subject
before
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
way
we
travel
on
,
until
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
;
the
road
be
still
very
heavy
,
and
the
coach
very
slow
.
 
<EOS>
to
mend
the
matter
,
the
old
priest
be
trouble
with
cramp
in
his
leg
,
so
that
he
have
to
give
a
terrible
yell
<EOS>
every
ten
minute
or
so
,
and
be
hoist
out
by
the
united
efforts
of
the
company
;
the
coach
always
stop
for
him
,
with
great
gravity
.
 
<EOS>
this
disorder
,
and
the
road
,
form
the
main
subject
of
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
,
in
the
afternoon
,
that
the
COUPE
have
discharge
two
people
,
and
have
only
one
passenger
inside
---
a
monstrous
ugly
Tuscan
,
with
a
great
purple
moustache
,
of
which
no
man
could
see
the
end
when
he
have
his
hat
on
---
I
take
advantage
of
its
well
accommodation
,
and
in
company
with
this
gentleman
(
who
be
very
conversational
and
good
-
humour
)
travel
on
,
until
nearly
eleven
o'clock
at
night
,
when
the
driver
report
that
he
could
not
think
of
go
any
farther
,
and
we
accordingly
make
a
halt
at
a
place
call
Stradella
.
  
<EOS>
the
inn
be
a
series
of
strange
gallery
surround
a
yard
where
our
coach
,
and
a
waggon
or
two
,
and
a
lot
of
fowl
,
and
firewood
,
be
all
heap
up
together
,
higgledy
-
piggledy
;
so
that
you
do
not
know
,
and
could
not
have
take
your
oath
,
which
be
a
fowl
and
which
be
a
cart
.
 
<EOS>
We
follow
a
sleepy
man
with
a
flare
torch
,
into
a
great
,
cold
room
,
where
there
be
two
immensely
broad
bed
,
on
what
look
like
two
immensely
broad
deal
dining
-
table
;
another
deal
table
of
similar
dimension
in
the
middle
of
the
bare
floor
;
four
window
;
and
two
chair
.
 
<EOS>
somebody
say
it
be
my
room
;
and
I
walk
up
and
down
it
,
for
half
an
hour
or
so
,
stare
at
the
Tuscan
,
the
old
priest
,
the
young
priest
,
and
the
Avvocato
(
Red
-
Nose
live
in
the
town
,
and
have
go
home
)
,
who
sit
upon
their
bed
,
and
stare
at
me
in
return
.
  
<EOS>
the
rather
dreary
whimsicality
of
this
stage
of
the
proceeding
,
be
interrupt
by
an
announcement
from
the
Brave
(
he
have
be
cook
)
<EOS>
that
supper
be
ready
;
and
to
the
priest
's
chamber
(
the
next
room
and

<EOS>
I

else
;
and
this
conclude
the
entertainment
.
  
<EOS>
before
I
can
sit
down
in
my
own
chamber
,
and
think
it
of
the
damp
,
the
door
open
,
and
the
Brave
come
move
in
,
in
the
middle
of
such
a
quantity
of
fuel
that
he
look
like
Birnam
Wood
take
a
winter
walk
.
 
<EOS>
He
kindle
this
heap
in
a
twinkling
,
and
produce
a
jorum
of
hot
brandy
and
water
;
for
that
bottle
of
his
keep
company
with
the
season
,
and
now
hold
nothing
but
the
pure
EAU
DE

.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
accomplish
this
feat
,
he
retire
for
the
night
;
and
I
hear
him
,
for
an
hour
afterwards
,
and
indeed
until
I
fall
asleep
,
make
joke
in
some
outhouse
(
apparently
under
the
pillow
)
,
where
he
be
smoke
cigar
with
a
party
of
confidential
friend
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
be
in
the
house
in
his
life
before
;
but
he
know
everybody
everywhere
,
before
he
have
be
anywhere
five
minute
;
and
be
certain
to
have
attract
to
himself
,
in
the
meantime
,
the
enthusiastic
devotion
of
the
whole
establishment
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
at
twelve
o'clock
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
at
four
o'clock
next
morning
,
he
be
up
again
,
fresh
than
a
full

blow
rise
;
make
blaze
fire
without
the
least
authority
from
the
landlord
;
produce
mug
of
scald
coffee
when
nobody
else
can
get
anything
but
cold
water
;
and
go
out
into
the
dark
street
,
and
roar
for
fresh
milk
,
on
the
chance
of
somebody
with
a
cow
get
up
to
supply
it
.
<EOS>
while
the
horse
be
"
come

"
I
stumble
out
into
the
town
too
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
be
all
one
little
Piazza
,
with
a
cold
damp
wind
blow
in
and
out
of
the
arch
,
alternately
,
in
a
sort
of
pattern
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
profoundly
dark

and
rain
heavily

and
I

an
hour

<EOS>
in
the
interval

sometimes

,
sometimes
Pagan
oath

<EOS>
sometimes

when
it

a
long

compound
oath
,
he
begin
with
Christianity
and
merge
into
Paganism
.
 
<EOS>
various
messenger
be
despatch
;
not
so
much
after
the
horse
,
as
after
each
other
;
for
the
first
messenger
never
come
back
,
and
all
the
rest
imitate
him
.
<EOS>
at
length
the
horse
appear
,
surround
by
all
the
messenger
;
some
kick
them

and
some
drag
them
,
and
all

the

at

<EOS>
connoisseur
fall
into
rapture
with
them
now

such
a
labyrinth
of
arm

:
 
such
heap
of
fore

shorten
limb

entangle
and
involve

jumble
together
:
 
no

go
mad

there

marble
pillar

behind

there
seem
to
be
at

nothing

altar

from

there

Petrarch

Monument

the
Baptistery

above

great
heavy

rather

where
the
Nobles

remote

<EOS>
such
desolation

enhance
in
the

fancy
by
its
gay
intention

design
,
none

worm
can
be
familiar
with
.
 
<EOS>
a
hundred

ten
year
have
pass
,
since
any

here
.
 
<EOS>
the

the
gash

the

drop
down

waste

and
only
tenant

damp

smear
the

spectral

lean

the

rot
so

that
a

be
throw
across
it

or
it
would
sink
beneath
the
tread
,
and
bury
the
visitor
in
the
gloomy
depth
beneath

<EOS>
the
desolation
and
decay
impress
themselves
on
all
the
sense
.
 
<EOS>
the
air
have
a
mouldering
smell
,
and
an
earthy
taste
;
any
stray
outer
sound
that
straggle
in
with
some
lose
sunbeam
,
be
muffled
and
heavy
;
and
the
worm
,
the
maggot
,
and
the
rot
have
change
the
surface
of
the
wood
beneath
the

as

roughen

<EOS>
if
ever

they

<EOS>
It
be
most
delicious
weather
,
when
we

into
Modena

where
the
darkness

sombre

the
main

<EOS>
I
pass
from

low

melancholy

<EOS>
think
how
strange
it
be

to
find

in
every
stagnant

this

monotonous

torpid
,
listless
system
,
I
come
out
by
another
door
,
and
be
suddenly
scared
to
death
by
a
blast
from
the
shrill
trumpet
that
ever
be
blow
.
 
<EOS>
immediately
,
come
tear
round
the
corner
,
an
equestrian
company
from
Paris
:
 
marshal
themselves
under
the
wall
of
the
church
,
and
flouting
,
with
their
horse
'
heel
,
the
griffin
,
lion
,
tiger
,
and
other
monster
in
stone
and
marble
,
decorate
its
exterior
.
 
<EOS>
first
,
there
come
a
stately
nobleman
with
a
great
deal
of
hair
,
and
no
hat
,
bear
an
enormous
banner
,
on
which
be
inscribe
,
MAZEPPA
!
 
<EOS>
TO
-
NIGHT
!
 
<EOS>
then
,
a
mexican
chief
,
with
a
great
pear
-
shape
club
on
his
shoulder
,
like
hercule
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
six
or
eight
roman
chariot
:
 
each
with
a
beautiful
lady
in
extremely
short
petticoat
,
and
unnaturally
pink
tight
,
erect
within
:
 
shed
beam
look
upon
the
crowd
,
in
which
there
be
a
latent
expression
of
discomposure
and
anxiety
,
for
which
I
could
not
account
,
until
,
as
the
open
back
of
each
chariot
present
itself
<EOS>
,
I
see
the
immense
difficulty
with
which
the
pink
leg
maintain
their
perpendicular
,
over
the
uneven
pavement
of
the
town
:
 
which
give
me
quite
a
new
idea
of
the
ancient
Romans
and
Britons
.
 
<EOS>
the
procession
be
bring
to
a
close
,
by
some
dozen
indomitable
warrior
of
different
nation
,
ride
two
and
two
,
and
haughtily
survey
the
tame
population
of
Modena
:
among
whom
,
however
,
they
occasionally
condescend
to
scatter
largesse
in
the
form
of
a
few
handbill
.
 
<EOS>
after
caracolle
among
the
lion
and
tiger
,
and
proclaim
that
evening
's
entertainment
with
blast
of
trumpet
,
it
then
file
off
,
by
the
other
end
of
the
square
,
and
leave
a
new
and
greatly
increase
dulness
behind
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
procession
have
so
entirely
pass
away
,
that
the
shrill
trumpet
be
mild
in
the
distance
,
and
the
tail
of
the
last
horse
be
hopelessly
round
the
corner
,
the
people
who
have
come
out
of
the
church
to
stare
at
it
,
go
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
but
one
old
lady
,
kneel
on
the
pavement
within
,
near
the
door
,
have
see
it
all
,
and
have
be
immensely
interested
,
without
get
up
;
and
this
old
lady
's
eye
,
<EOS>
at
that
juncture
,
I
happen
to
catch
:
 
to
our
mutual
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
She
cut
our
embarrassment
very
short
,
however
,
by
cross
herself
devoutly
,
and
go
down
,
at
full
length
,
on
her
face
,
before
a
figure
in
a
fancy
petticoat
and
a
gilt
crown
;
which
be
so
like
one
of
the
procession
-
figure
,
that
perhaps
at
this
hour
she
may
think
the
whole
appearance
a
celestial
vision
.
<EOS>
anyhow
,
I
must
certainly
have
forgive
her
her
interest
in
the
Circus
,
though
I
have
be
her
Father
Confessor
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
fiery
-
eyed
old
man
with
a
crooked
shoulder
,
in
the
cathedral
,
who
take
it
very
ill
that
I
make
no
effort
to
see
the
bucket
(
keep
in
an
old
tower
)
which
the
people
of
Modena
take
away
from
the
people
of
Bologna
in
the
fourteenth
century
,
and
about
which
there
be
war
make
and
a
mock
-
heroic
poem
by
TASSONE
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
be
quite
content
,
however
,
to
look
at
the
outside
of
the
tower
,
and
feast
,
in
imagination
,
on
the
bucket
within
;
and
prefer
to
loiter
in
the
shade
of
the
tall
Campanile
,
and
about
the
cathedral
;
I
have
no
personal
knowledge
of
this
bucket
,
even
at
the
present
time
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
we
be
at
Bologna
,
before
the
little
old
man
(
or
the
Guide
-
Book
)
would
have
consider
that
we
have
half
do
justice
to
the
wonder
of
Modena
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
such
a
delight
to
me
to
leave
new
scene
behind
,
and
still
go
on
,
encounter
new
scene
---
and
<EOS>
,
moreover
,
I
have
such
a
perverse
disposition
in
respect
of
sight
that
be
cut
,
and
dry
,
and
dictate
---
<EOS>
that
I
fear
I
sin
against
similar
authority
in
every
place
I
visit
.
  
<EOS>
be
this
as
it
may
,
in
the
pleasant
cemetery
at
Bologna
,
I
find
myself
walk
next
Sunday
morning
,
among
the
stately
marble
tomb
and
colonnade
,
in
company
with
a
crowd
of
peasant
,
and
escort
by
a
little
cicerone
of
that
town
,
who
be
excessively
anxious
for
the
honour
of
the
place
,
and
most
solicitous
to
divert
my
attention
from
the
bad
monument
:
 
whereas
he
be
never
tired
of
extoll
the
good
one
.
 
<EOS>
see
this
little
man
(
a
good
-
humoured
little
man
he
be
,
who
seem
to
have
nothing
in
his
face
but
shine
tooth
and
eye
)
look
wistfully
at
a
certain
plot
of
grass
,
I
ask
him
who
be
bury
there
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
poor
people
,
Signore
,
"
he
say
,
with
a
shrug
and
a
smile
,
and
stop
to
look
back
at
me
---
for
he
always
go
on
a
little
before
,
and
take
off
his
hat
to
introduce
every
new
monument
.
 
<EOS>
"
only
the
poor
,
Signore
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
cheerful
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
lively
.
 
<EOS>
how
green
it
be
,
how
cool
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
like
a
meadow
!
<EOS>
there
be
five
,
"
---
hold
up
all
the
finger
of
his
right
hand
to
express
the
number
,
which
an
italian
peasant
will
always
do
,
if
it
be
within
the
compass
of
his
ten
finger
,
---
"
there
be
five
of
my
little
child
bury
there
,
Signore
;
just
there
;
a
little
to
the
right
.
 
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
thank
to
God
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
cheerful
.
 
<EOS>
how
green
it
be
,
how
cool
it
be
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
quite
a
meadow
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
look
me
very
hard
in
the
face
,
and
see
I
be
sorry
for
him
,
take
a
pinch
of
snuff
(
every
cicerone
take
snuff
)
,
and
make
a
little
bow
;
partly
in
deprecation
of
his
have
allude
to
such
a
subject
,
and
partly
in
memory
of
the
child
and
of
his
favourite
saint
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
as
unaffected
and
as
perfectly
natural
a
little
bow
,
as
ever
man
make
.
 
<EOS>
immediately
afterwards
,
he
take
his
hat
off
altogether
,
and
beg
to
introduce
me
to
the
next
monument
;
and
his
eye
and
his
tooth
shine
brighter
than
before
.
    
<EOS>
through
Bologna
and
Ferrara
 
<EOS>
there
be
such
a
very
smart
official
in
attendance
at
the
Cemetery
where
the
little
Cicerone
have
bury
his
child
,
that
when
the
little
Cicerone
suggest
to
me
,
in
a
whisper
,
that
there
would
be
no
offence
in
present
this
officer
,
in
return
for
some
slight
extra
service
,
with
a
couple
of
paul
(
about
tenpence
,
english
money
)
,
I
look
incredulously
at
his
cocked
hat
,
wash
-
leather
glove
,
well
-
make
uniform
,
and
dazzle
button
,
and
rebuke
the
little
cicerone
with
a
grave
shake
of
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
in
splendour
of
appearance
,
he
be
at
least
equal
to
the
Deputy
Usher
of
the
Black
Rod
;
and
the
idea
of
his
carrying
,
as
Jeremy
Diddler
would
say
,
"
such
a
thing
as
tenpence
"
away
with
him
,
seem
monstrous
.
<EOS>
He
take
it
in
excellent
part
,
however
,
when
I
make
bold
to
give
it
him
,
and
pull
off
his
cocked
hat
with
a
flourish
that
would
have
be
a
bargain
at
double
the
money
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
to
be
his
duty
to
describe
the
monument
to
the
people
---
at
all
event
he
be
do
so
;
and
when
I
compare
him
,
like
Gulliver
in
Brobdingnag
,
"
with
the
institution
of
my
own
beloved
country
,
I
could
not
refrain
from
tear
of
pride
and
exultation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
have
no
pace
at
all
;
no
more
than
a
tortoise
.
 
<EOS>
He
loiter
as
the
people
loiter
,
that
they
may
gratify
their
curiosity
;
and
positively
allow
them
,
now
and
then
,
to
read
the
inscription
on
the
tomb
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
neither
shabby
,
nor
insolent
,
nor
churlish
,
nor
ignorant
.
 
<EOS>
He
speak
his
own
language
with
perfect
propriety
,
and
seem
to
consider
himself
,
in
his
way
,
a
kind
of
teacher
of
the
people
,
and
to
entertain
a
just
respect
both
for
himself
and
them
.
<EOS>
They
would
no
more
have
such
a
man
for
a
Verger
in
Westminster
Abbey
,
than
they
would
let
the
people
in
(
as
they
do
at
Bologna
)
to
see
the
monument
for
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
again
,
an
ancient
sombre
town
,
under
the
brilliant
sky
;
with
heavy
arcade
over
the
footway
of
the
old
street
,
and
light
and
more
cheerful
archway
in
the
new
portion
of
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
again
,
brown
pile
of
sacred
building
,
with
more
bird
fly
in
and
out
of
chink
in
the
stone
;
and
more
snarl
monster
for
the
basis
of
the
pillar
.
 
<EOS>
again
,
rich
church
,
drowsy
masse
,
curl
incense
,
tinkle
bell
,
priest
in
bright
vestment
:
 
picture
,
taper
,
lace
altar
cloth
,
crosse
,
image
,
and
artificial
flower
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
grave
and
learn
air
about
the
city
,
and
a
pleasant
gloom
upon
it
,
that
would
leave
it
,
a
distinct
and
separate
impression
in
the
mind
,
among
a
crowd
of
city
,
though
it
be
not
still
further
mark
in
the
traveller
's
remembrance
by
the
two
brick
lean
tower
(
sufficiently
unsightly
in
themselves
,
it
must
be
acknowledge
)
,
incline
cross
-
wise
as
if
they
be
bow
stiffly
to
each
other
---
a
most
extraordinary
termination
to
the
perspective
of
some
of
the
narrow
street
.
 
<EOS>
the
college
,
and
church
too
,
and
palace
:
 
and
above
all
the
academy
of
Fine
Arts
,
where
there
be
a
host
of
interesting
picture
,
especially
by
GUIDO
,
DOMENICHINO
,
and
LUDOVICO
CARACCI
:
 
give
it
a
place
of
its
own
in
the
memory
.
 
<EOS>
even
though
these
be
not
,
and
there
be
nothing
else
to
remember
it
by
,
the
great
Meridian
on
the
pavement
of
the
church
of
San
Petronio
,
where
the
sunbeam
mark
the
time
among
the
kneel
people
,
would
give
it
a
fanciful
and
pleasant
interest
.
  
<EOS>
Bologna
be
very
full
of
tourist
,
detain
there
by
an
inundation
which
render
the
road
to
Florence
impassable
<EOS>
,
I
be
quarter
up
at
the
top
of
an
hotel
,
in
an
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
room
which
I
never
could
find
:
 
contain
a
bed
,
big
enough
for
a
boarding
-
school
,
which
I
could
not
fall
asleep
in
.
 
<EOS>
the
chief
among
the
waiter
who
visit
this
lonely
retreat
,
where
there
be
no
other
company
but
the
swallow
in
the
broad
eave
over
the
window
,
be
a
man
of
one
idea
in
connection
with
the
English
;
and
the
subject
of
this
harmless
monomania
,
be
Lord
Byron
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
the
discovery
by
accidentally
remark
to
him
,
at
breakfast
,
that
the
matting
with
which
the
floor
be
cover
,
be
very
comfortable
at
that
season
,
when
he
immediately
reply
that
Milor
Beeron
have
be
much
attach
to
that
kind
of
matting
.
 
<EOS>
Observing
,
at
the
same
moment
,
that
I
take
no
milk
,
he
exclaim
with
enthusiasm
,
that
Milor
Beeron
have
never
touch
it
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
,
I
take
it
for
grant
,
in
my
innocence
,
that
he
have
be
one
of
the
Beeron
servant
;
but
<EOS>
no
,
he
say
,
no
,
he
be
in
the
habit
of
speak
about
my
Lord
,
to
english
gentleman
;
that
be
all
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
all
about
him
,
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
in
proof
of
it
,
he
connect
him
with
every
possible
topic
,
from
the
Monte
Pulciano
wine
at
dinner
(
which
be
grow
on
an
estate
he
have
own
)
,
to
the
big
bed
itself
,
which
be
the
very
model
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
leave
the
inn
,
he
couple
with
his
final
bow
in
the
yard
,
a
part
assurance
that
the
road
by
which
I
be
go
,
have
be
Milor
Beeron
's
favourite
ride
;
and
before
the
horse
's
foot
have
well
begin
to
clatter
on
the
pavement
,
he
run
briskly
up
-
stair
again
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
to
tell
some
other
Englishman
in
some
other
solitary
room
that
the
guest
who
have
just
depart
be
Lord
Beeron
's
live
image
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
enter
Bologna
by
night
---
almost
midnight
---
and
all
along
the
road
thither
,
after
our
entrance
into
the
Papal
territory
:
which
be
not
,
in
any
part
,
supremely
well
governed
,
Saint
Peter
's
key
be
rather
rusty
now
;
the
driver
have
so
worried
about
the
danger
of
robber
in
travel
after
dark
,
and
have
so
infect
the
brave
Courier
,
and
the
two
have
be
so
constantly
stop
and
get
up
and
down
to
look
after
a
portmanteau
which
be
tie
on
behind
,
that
I
should
have
feel
almost
oblige
to
any
one
who
would
have
have
the
goodness
to
take
it
away
.
 
<EOS>
hence
it
be
stipulate
,
that
,
whenever
we
leave
Bologna
,
we
should
start
so
as
not
to
arrive
at
Ferrara
later
than
eight
at
night
;
and
a
delightful
afternoon
and
evening
journey
<EOS>
it
be
,
albeit
through
a
flat
district
which
gradually
become
more
marshy
from
the
overflow
of
brooks
and
river
in
the
recent
heavy
rain
.
  
<EOS>
at
sunset
,
when
I
be
walk
on
alone
,
while
the
horse
rest
,
I
arrive
upon
a
little
scene
,
which
,
by
one
of
those
singular
mental
operation
of
which
we
be
all
conscious
,
seem
perfectly
familiar
to
me
,
and
which
I
see
distinctly
now
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
much
in
it
.
<EOS>
in
the
blood
red
light
,
there
be
a
mournful
sheet
of
water
,
just
stir
by
the
evening
wind
;
upon
its
margin
a
few
tree
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
foreground
be
a
group
of
silent
peasant
girl
lean
over
the
parapet
of
a
little
bridge
,
and
look
,
now
up
at
the
sky
,
now
down
into
the
water
;
in
the
distance
,
a
deep
bell
;
the
shade
of
approach
night
on
everything
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
murder
there
,
in
some
former
life

I
could
not
have
seem
to
remember
the
place
more
thoroughly
,
or
with
a
more
emphatic
chilling
of
the
blood
;
and
the
mere
remembrance
of
it
acquire
in
that
minute
,
be
so
strengthen
by
the
imaginary
recollection
,
that
I
hardly
think
I
could
forget
it

<EOS>
more
solitary
,
more
depopulated
,
more
deserted
,
old
Ferrara
,
than
any
city
of
the
solemn
brotherhood
!
 
<EOS>
the
grass
so
grow
up
in
the
silent
street
,
that
any
one
may
make
hay
there
,
literally
,
while
the
sun
shine
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
sun
shine
with
diminished
cheerfulness
in
grim
Ferrara
;
and
the
people
be
so
few
who
pass
and
re
-
pass
through
the
place
,
that
the
flesh
of
its
inhabitant
may
be
grass
indeed
,
and
grow
in
the
square
.
  
<EOS>
I
wonder
why
the
head
coppersmith
in
an
italian
town
,
always
live
next
door
to
the
hotel
,
or
opposite
:
 
<EOS>
make
the
visitor
feel
as
if
the
beating
hammer
be
his
own
heart
,
palpitate
with
a
deadly
energy
!
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
why
jealous
corridor
surround
the
bedroom
on
all
side
,
and
fill
it
with
unnecessary
door
that
can
not
be
shut
,
and
will
not
open
,
and
abut
on
pitchy
darkness
!
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
why
it
be
not
enough
that
these
distrustful
genii
stand
agape
at
one
's
dream
all
night
,
but
there
must
also
be
round
open
porthole
,
high
in
the
wall
,
suggestive
,
when
a
mouse
or
rat
be
hear
behind
the
wainscot
,
of
a
somebody
scrape
the
wall
with
his
toe
,
in
his
endeavour
to
reach
one
of
these
porthole
and
look
in
!
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
why
the
faggot
be
so
construct
,
as
to
know
of
no
effect
but
an
agony
of
heat
when
they
be
light
and
replenish
,
and
an
agony
of
cold
and
suffocation
at
all
other
time
!
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
,
above
all
,
why
it
be
the
great
feature
of
domestic
architecture
in
italian
inn
,
that
all
the
fire
go
up
the
chimney
,
except
the
smoke
!
  
<EOS>
the
answer
matter
little

<EOS>
coppersmith
,
door
,
porthole
,
smoke
,
and
faggot
,
be
welcome
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
give
me
the
smile
face
of
the
attendant
,
man
or
woman
;
the
courteous
manner
;
the
amiable
desire
to
please
and
to
be
pleased
;
the
light

,
pleasant
,

so
many

It
be
good
to
see
it

without

a

without

<EOS>
pestilence

in

His

He

<EOS>
He
receive
the
proposal
with
a
perfect
yell

derision
;
brandish
his
whip
about
his
head
(
such
a
whip

<EOS>
it
be
more
like
a
home

make
bow

;
fling
up
his

much
high
than

and
disappear

in

paroxysm

somewhere
in

an
italian
dream
 
<EOS>
I
had
be
travel
,
for
some
day
;
rest
very
little
in
the
night
,
and
never
in
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
the
rapid
and
unbroken
succession
of
novelty
that
have
pass
before
me
,
come
back
like
half
-
form
dream
;
and
a
crowd
of
object
wander
in
the
great
confusion
through
my
mind
,
as
I
travel
on
,
by
a
solitary
road
.
 
<EOS>
at
interval
,
some
one
among
them
would
stop
,
as
it
be
,
in
its
restless
flitting
to
and
fro
,
and
enable
me
to
look
at
it
,
quite
steadily
,
and
behold
it
in
full
distinctness
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
few
moment
,
it
would
dissolve
,
like
a
view
in
a
magic
-
lantern
;
and
while
I
see
some
part
of
it
quite
plainly
,
and
some
faintly
,
and
some
not
at
all
,
would
show
me
another
of
the
many
place
I
have
lately
see
,
linger
behind
it
,
and
come
through
it
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
no
sooner
visible
than
,
in
its
turn
,
it
melt
into
something
else
.
  
<EOS>
at
one
moment
,
I
be
stand
again
,
before
the
brown
old
rugged
church
of
Modena
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
recognise
the
curious
pillar
with
grim
monster
for
their
basis
,
I
seem
to
see
them
,
stand
by
themselves
in
the
quiet
square
at
Padua
,
where
there
be
the
staid
old
University
,
and
the
figure
,
demurely
gown
,
group
here
and
there
in
the
open
space
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
I
be
stroll
in
the
outskirt
of
that
pleasant
city
,
admire
the
unusual
neatness
of
the
dwelling
-
house
,
garden
,
and
orchard
,
as
I
have
see
them
a
few
hour
before
.
 
<EOS>
in
their
stead
arise
,
immediately
,
the
two
tower
of
Bologna
;
and
the
most
obstinate
of
all
these
object
,
fail
to
hold
its
ground
,
a
minute
,
before
the
monstrous
moated
castle
of
Ferrara
,
which
,
like
an
illustration
to
a
wild
romance
,
come
back
again
in
the
red
sunrise
,
lord
it
over
the
solitary
,
grass
-
grow
,
withered
town
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
have
that
incoherent
but
delightful
jumble
in
my
brain
,
which
traveller
be
apt
to
have
,
and
be
indolently
willing
to
encourage
.
 
<EOS>
every
shake
of
the
coach
in
which
I
sit
,
half
doze
in
the
dark
,
appear
to
jerk
some
new
recollection
out
of
its
place
,
and
to
jerk
some
other
new
recollection
into
it
;
and
in
this
state
I
fall
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
awaken
after
some
time
(
as
I
think
)
by
the
stopping
of
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
now
quite
night
,
and
we
be
at
the
waterside
.
<EOS>
there
lie
here
,
a
black
boat
,
with
a
little
house
or
cabin
in
it
of
the
same
mournful
colour
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
take
my
seat
in
this
,
the
boat
be
paddle
,
by
two
man
,
towards
a
great
light
,
lie
in
the
distance
on
the
sea
.
  
<EOS>
ever
and
again
,
there
be
a
dismal
sigh
of
wind
.
 
<EOS>
It
ruffle
the
water
,
and
rock
the
boat
,
and
send
the
dark
cloud
fly
before
the
star
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
think
how
strange
it
be
,
to
be
float
away
at
that
hour
:
 
leave
the
land
behind
,
and
go
on
,
towards
this
light
upon
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
It
soon
begin
to
burn
brighter
;
and
from
be
one
light
become
a
cluster
of
taper
,
twinkle
and
shine
out
of
the
water
,
as
the
boat
approach
towards
them
by
a
dreamy
kind
of
track
,
mark
out
upon
the
sea
by
post
and
pile
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
float
on
,
five
mile
or
so
,
over
the
dark
water
,
when
I
hear
it
ripple
in
my
dream
,
against
some
obstruction
near
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
look
out
attentively
,
I
see
,
through
the
gloom
,
a
something
black
and
massive
---
like
a
shore
,
but
lie
close
and
flat
upon
the
water
,
like
a
raft
---
which
we
be
glide
past
.
 
<EOS>
the
chief
of
the
two
rower
say
it
be
a
burial
-
place
.
  
<EOS>
full
of
the
interest
and
wonder
which
a
cemetery
lie
out
there
,
in
the
lonely
sea
,
inspire
,
I
turn
to
gaze
upon
it
as
it
should
recede
in
our
path
,
when
it
be
quickly
shut
out
from
my
view
.
<EOS>
before
I
know
by
what
,
or
<EOS>
how
,
I
find
that
we
be
glide
up
a
street
---
a
phantom
street
;
the
house
rise
on
both
side
,
from
the
water
,
and
the
black
boat
glide
on
beneath
their
window
.
<EOS>
light
be
shine
from
some
of
these
casement
,
plumb
the
depth
of
the
black
stream
with
their
reflect
ray
,
but
all
be
profoundly
silent
.
  
<EOS>
so
we
advance
into
this
ghostly
city
,
continue
to
hold
our
course
through
narrow
street
and
lane
,
all
fill
and
flow
with
water
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
the
corner
where
our
way
branch
off
,
be
so
acute
and
narrow
,
that
it
seem
impossible
for
the
long
slend
boat
to
turn
them
;
but
the
rower
,
with
a
low
melodious
cry
of
warning
,
send
it
skim
on
without
a
pause
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
the
rower
of
another
black
boat
like
our
own
,
echo
the
cry
,
and
slacken
their
speed
(
as
I
think
we
do
ours
)
would
come
flit
past
us
like
a
dark
shadow
.
 
<EOS>
other
boat
,
of
the
same
sombre
hue
,
be
lie
moor
,
I
think
,
to
paint
pillar
,
near
to
dark
mysterious
door
that
open
straight
upon
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
these
be
empty
;
in
some
,
the
rower
lie
asleep
;
towards
one
,
I
see
some
figure
come
down
a
gloomy
archway
from
the
interior
of
a
palace
:
 
gaily
dress
,
and
attend
by
torch
-
bearer
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
but
<EOS>
a
glimpse
I
have
of
them
;
for
a
bridge
,
so
low
and
close
upon
the
boat
that
it
seem
ready
to
fall
down
and
crush
us
:
 
one
of
the
many
bridge
that
perplex
the
Dream
:
 
blot
them
out
,
instantly
.
 
<EOS>
on
we
go
,
float
towards
the
heart
of
this
strange
place
---
with
water
all
about
us
where
never
water
be
elsewhere
---
cluster
of
house
,
church
,
heap
of
stately
building
grow
out
of
it
---
and
,
everywhere
,
the
same
extraordinary
silence
.
<EOS>
presently
,
we
shoot
across
a
broad
and
open
stream
;
and
pass
,
as
I
think
,
before
a
spacious
paved
quay
,
where
the
bright
lamp
with
which
it
be
illuminate
show
long
row
of
arch
and
pillar
,
of
ponderous
construction
and
great
strength
,
but
as
light
to
the
eye
as
garland
of
hoarfrost
or
gossamer
---
and
where
,
for
the
first
time
,
I
see
people
walk
---
arrive
at
a
flight
of
step
lead
from
the
water
to
a
large
mansion
,
where
,
have
pass
through
corridor
and
gallery
innumerable
,
I
lie
down
to
rest
;
listen
to
the
black
boat
steal
up
and
down
below
the
window
on
the
ripple
water
,
till
I
fall
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
the
glory
of
the
day
that
break
upon
me
in
this
dream
;
its
freshness
,
motion
,
buoyancy
;
its
sparkle
of
the
sun
in
water
;
its
clear
blue
sky
and
rustle
air
;
no
wake
word
can
tell
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
from
my
window
,
I
look
down
on
boat
and
bark
;
on
mast
,
sail
,
cordage
,
flag
;
on
group
of
busy
sailor
,
work
at
the
cargo
of
these
vessel
;
on
wide
quay
,
strew
with
bale
,
cask
,
merchandise
of
many
kind
;
on
great
ship
,
lie
near
at
hand
in
stately
indolence
;
on
island
,
crown
with
gorgeous
dome
and
turret
:
 
and
where
golden
crosse
glitter
in
the
light
,
atop
of
wondrous
church
,
spring
from
the
sea
!
 
<EOS>
go
down
upon
the
margin
of
the
green
sea
,
roll
on
before
the
door
,
and
fill
all
the
street
,
I
come
upon
a
place
of
such
surpass
beauty
,
and
such
grandeur
,
that
all
the
rest
be
poor
and
fade
,
in
comparison
with
its
absorbing
loveliness
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
Piazza
,
as
I
think
;
anchor
,
like
all
the
rest
,
in
the
deep
ocean
.
 
<EOS>
on
its
broad
bosom
,
be
a
Palace
,
more
majestic
and
magnificent
in
its
old
age
,
than
all
the
building
of
the
earth
,
in
the
high
prime
and
fulness
of
their
youth
.
 
<EOS>
cloister
and
gallery
:
 
so
light
<EOS>
,
they
may
have
be
the
work
of
fairy
hand
:
so
strong
that
century
have
batter
them
in
vain
:
 
wound
round
and
round
this
palace
,
and
enfold
it
with
a
cathedral
,
gorgeous
in
the
wild
luxuriant
fancy
of
the
East
.
 
<EOS>
at
no
great
distance
from
its
porch
,
a
lofty
tower
,
stand
by
itself
,
and
rear
its
proud
head
,
alone
,
into
the
sky
,
look
out
upon
the
Adriatic
Sea
.
<EOS>
near
to
the
margin
of
the
stream
,
be
two
ill

omen
pillar
of
red
granite
;
one
have
on
its
top
,
a
figure
with
a
sword
and
shield
;
the
other
,
a
wing
lion
.
 
<EOS>
not
far
from
these
again
,
a
second
tower
:
 
rich
of
the
rich
in
all
its
decoration
:
 
even
here
,
where
all
be
rich
:
 
sustain
aloft
,
a
great
orb
,
gleam
with
gold
and
deep
blue
:
 
<EOS>
the
twelve
sign
paint
on
it
,
and
<EOS>
a
mimic
sun
revolve
in
its
course
around
them
:
 
while
above
,
two
bronze
giant
hammer
out
the
hour
upon
a
sound
bell
.
 
<EOS>
an
oblong
square
of
lofty
house
of
the
whitest
stone
,
surround
by
a
light
and
beautiful
arcade
,
form
part
of
this
enchant
scene
;
and
,
here
and
there
,
gay
mast
for
flag
rise
,
taper
,
from
the
pavement
of
the
unsubstantial
ground
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
I
enter
the
Cathedral
,
and
go
in
and
out
among
its
many
arch
:
 
traverse
its
whole
extent
.
 
<EOS>
a
grand
and
dreamy
structure
,
of
immense
proportion
;
golden
with
old
mosaic
;
redolent
of
perfume
;
dim
with
the
smoke
of
incense
;
costly
in
treasure
of
precious
stone
and
metal
,
glitter
through
iron
bar
;
holy
with
the
body
of
deceased
saint
;
rainbow

hue
with
window
of
stained
glass
;
dark
with
carved
wood
and
colour
marble
;
obscure
in
its
vast
height
,
and
lengthen
distance
;
shine
with
silver
lamp
and
wink
light
;
unreal
,
fantastic
,
solemn
,
inconceivable
throughout
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
enter
the
old
palace
;
pace
silent
gallery
and
council
-
chamber
,
where
the
old
ruler
of
this
mistress
of
the
water
look
sternly
out
,
in
picture
,
from
the
wall
,
and
where
her
high
-
prowed
galley
,
still
victorious
on
canva
,
fight
and
conquer
as
of
old
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
wander
through
its
hall
of
state
and
triumph
---
bare
and
empty
now
!
<EOS>
---
and
muse
on
its
pride
and
may
,
extinct
:
 
for
that
be
past
;
all
past
:
 
<EOS>
hear
a
voice
say
,
"
some
token
of
its
ancient
rule
and
some
consoling
reason
for
its
downfall
,
may
be
trace
here
,
yet
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
dream
that
I
be
lead
on
,
then
,
into
some
jealous
room
,
communicate
with
a
prison
near
the
palace
;
separate
from
it
by
a
lofty
bridge
cross
a
narrow
street
;
and
call
,
I
dream
,
the
Bridge
of
Sighs
.
  
<EOS>
but
first
I
pass
two
jagged
slit
in
a
stone
wall
;
the
lion
'
mouth
---
now
toothless
---
where
,
in
the
distempered
horror
of
my
sleep
,
I
think
denunciation
of
innocent
man
to
the
old
wicked
Council
,
have
be
drop
through
,
many
a
time
,
when
the
night
be
dark
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
when
I
see
the
council
-
room
to
which
such
prisoner
be
take
for
examination
,
and
the
door
by
which
they
pass
out
,
when
they
be
condemn
---
a
door
that
never
close
upon
a
man
with
life
and
hope
before
him
---
my
heart
appear
to
die
within
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
smite
harder
though
,
when
,
torch
in
hand
,
I
descend
from
the
cheerful
day
into
two
range
,
one
below
another
,
of
dismal
,
awful
,
horrible
stone
cell
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
quite
dark
.
 
<EOS>
each
have
a
loop
-
hole
in
its
massive
wall
,
where
,
in
the
old
time
,
every
day
,
a
torch
be
place
---
I
dream
---
to
light
the
prisoner
within
,
for
half
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
the
captive
,
by
the
glimmering
of
these
brief
ray
,
have
scratch
and
cut
inscription
in
the
blacken
vault
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
for
their
labour
with
a
rusty
nail
's
point
,
have
outlive
their
agony
and
them
,
through
many
generation
.
  
<EOS>
one
cell
,
I
see
,
in
which
no
man
remain
for
more
than
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
;
be
mark
for
dead
before
he
enter
it

<EOS>
hard
by

another

and
a
dismal
one
,
whereto
,
at
midnight
,
the
confessor
come
---
a
monk
brown
-
robe
,
and
hood
---
ghastly
in
the
day
,
and
free
bright
air
,
but
in
the
midnight
of
that
murky
prison
,
Hope
's
extinguisher
,
and
Murder
's
herald
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
my
foot
upon
the
spot
,
where
,
at
the
same
dread
hour
,
the
shriven
prisoner
be
strangle
;
and
strike
my
hand
upon
the
guilty
door
---
low
-
browed
and
stealthy
---
through
which
the
lumpish
sack
be
carry
out
into
a
boat
,
and
row
away
,
and
drown
where
it
be
death
to
cast
a
net
.
  
<EOS>
around
this
dungeon
stronghold
,
and
above
some
part
of
it
:
 
lick
the
rough
wall
without
,
and
smear
them
with
damp
and
slime
within
:
 
stuff
dank
weed
and
refuse
into
chink
and
crevice
,
as
if
the
very
stone
and
bar
have
mouth
to
stop
:
 
furnish
a
smooth
road
for
the
removal
of
the
body
of
the
secret
victim
of
the
State
---
a
road
so
ready
that
it
go
along
with
them

and
run
before
them

like
a
cruel
officer

flow
the
same
water
that
fill
this
Dream
of
mine
,
and
make
it
seem
one

even
at
the
time

<EOS>
descend
from
the
palace
by
a
staircase
,
call
,
I
think
,
the
Giant
's
---
I
have
some
imaginary
recollection
of
an
old
man
abdicating
,
come
,
more
slowly
and
more
feebly
,
down
it
,
when
he
hear
the
bell
,
proclaim
his
successor
---
<EOS>
I
glide
off
,
in
one
of
the
dark
boat
,
until
we
come
to
an
old
arsenal
guard
by
four
marble
lion

<EOS>
to
make
my
dream
more
monstrous
and
unlikely
,
one
of

have
word
and
sentence
upon
its
body
,
inscribe
there
,
at
an
unknown
time
,
and
in
an
unknown
language
;
so
that
their
purport
be
a
mystery
to
all
man
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
little
sound
of
hammer
in
this
place
for
build
ship
,
and
little
work
in
progress
;
for
the
greatness
of
the
city
be
no
more

as
I
have
say
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
seem
a
very
wreck
find
drift
on

a
strange

hoist
in
its
honourable
station

and
stranger
stand
at

I

no

but
,
in
its
place

there
be
a
tiny
model

make
from
recollection
like
the

greatness
;
and
it
tell
of
what
have
be
(
so
be
the
strong

weak
confound
in
the

)
almost
as
eloquently
as
the
massive

roof

rear
to
overshadow
stately
ship
that
have
no
other
shadow
now
,
upon

<EOS>
an
armoury

there
yet

<EOS>
Plundered

an
armoury

<EOS>
with

noiselessly

near

up

to
the
lamentation
and
confession
of
the
wretch
within
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
that
grim
resemblance
in
them
to
the
human
shape
---
they
be
such
mould
of
sweating
face
,
pain
and
cramp
---
that
it
be
difficult
to
think
them
empty
;
and
terrible
distortion
linger
within

seem
to
follow
me
,
when

take
to
my

again

I
row
off

a
kind

garden
or
public
walk
in
the

where
there
be
grass

<EOS>
but
I
forget

when
I
stand
upon

brink
---
<EOS>
I
stand
there
,
in
my
dream

and
look
,
along
the
ripple
,
to
the
set
sun
;
before
me
,
in
the
sky
and
on
the
deep

a
crimson
flush
;
and
behind
me
the
whole
city
resolve
into
streak
of
red
and
purple
,
on
the
water
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
luxurious
wonder
of
so
rare
a

I
take
but
little
heed
of
time
,
and
have
but
<EOS>
little
understanding
of
its
flight

<EOS>
but
there
be
day
and
night
in
it
;
and
when
the
sun
be
high
,
and
when
the
ray
of
lamp
be
crooked
in
the
running
water
,
I
be
still
afloat
,
I
think
:
 
plash
the
slippery
wall
and
house
with
the
cleaving
of
the
tide
,
as
my

bear
upon

skim
along

<EOS>
sometimes
,
alight
at

I
wander
on

from

from

through
labyrinth

ancient

be

replete
with
such

beauty

with
such
passion

truth
and
power
:
 
that
they
seem
so
many
young
and
fresh
reality
among
a
host
of
spectre
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
these
,
often
intermingle
with
the
old
day
of
the
city
:
with
its
beauty
,
tyrant
,
captain
,
patriot

merchant

counter

with
its

all

then

come
down

I
pass
into

straight
,
and
crooked
;
mean
and
grand
,
crazy
and
strong
.
<EOS>
twine
among
a
tangle
lot
of
boat
and
barge
,
and
shoot
out
at
last
into
a
Grand
Canal
!
 
<EOS>
there
,
in
the
errant
fancy
of
my
dream
,
I
see
old
Shylock
pass
to
and
fro
upon
a
bridge
,
all
build
upon
with
shop
and
hum
with
the
tongue
of
man
;
a
form
I
seem
to
know
for
Desdemona
's
,
lean
down
through
a
latticed
blind
to
pluck
a
flower
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
in
the
dream
,
I
think
that
Shakespeare
's
spirit
be
abroad
upon
the
water
somewhere
:
 
steal
through
the
city
.
  
<EOS>
at
night
,
when
two
votive
lamp
burn
before
an
image
of
the
Virgin
,
in
a
gallery
outside
the
great
cathedral
,
near
the
roof
,
I
fancy
that
the
great
piazza
of
the
Winged
Lion
be
a
blaze
of
cheerful
light
,
and
that
its
whole
arcade
be
throng
with
people
;
while
crowd
be
divert
themselves
in
splendid
coffee
-
house
opening
from
it
---
which
be
never
shut
,
I
think
,
but
open
all
night
long
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
bronze
giant
strike
the
hour
of
midnight
on
the
bell
,
I
think
the
life
and
animation
of
the
city
be
all
centre
here
;
and
as
I
row
away
,
abreast
the
silent
quay
,
I
only
see
them
dotted
,
here
and
there
,
with
sleep
boatman
wrap
up
in
their
cloak
,
and
lie
at
full
length
upon
the
stone
.
  
<EOS>
but
close
about
the
quay
and
church
,
palace
and
prison
suck
at
their
wall
,
and
well
up
into
the
secret
place
of
the
town
<EOS>
:
creep
the
water
always
.
 
<EOS>
noiseless
and
watchful
:
 
coil
round
and
round
it
,
in
its
many
fold
,
like
an
old
serpent
:
 
wait
for
the
time
,
I
think
,
when
people
should
look
down
into
its
depth
for
any
stone
of
the
old
city
that
have
claim
to
be
its
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
thus
it
float
me
away
,
until
I
awoke
in
the
old
market
-
place
at
Verona
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
,
many
and
many
a
time
,
<EOS>
think
since
,
of
this
strange
dream
upon
the
water
:
 
half
-
wondering
if
it
lie
there
yet
,
and
if
its
name
be
VENICE
.
    
<EOS>
by
Verona
,
Mantua
,
and
Milan
,
across
the
Pass
of
the
Simplon
into
Switzerland
 
I
had
be
half
afraid
to
go
to
Verona
,
lest
it
should
at
all
put
me
out
of
conceit
with
Romeo
and
Juliet
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
I
be
no
sooner
come
into
the
old
market
-
place
,
than
the
misgive
vanish
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
fanciful
,
quaint
,
and
picturesque
a
place
,
form
by
such
an
extraordinary
and
rich
variety
of
fantastic
building
,
that
there
could
be
nothing
well
at
the
core
of
even
this
romantic
town
:
scene
of
one
of
the
most
romantic
and
beautiful
of
story
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
natural
enough
,
to
go
straight
from
the
market
-
place
,
to
the
House
of
the
Capulets
,
now
degenerate
into
a
most
miserable
little
inn
.
 
<EOS>
Noisy
vetturini
and
muddy
market
-
cart
be
dispute
possession
of
the
yard
,
which
be
ankle
-
deep
in
dirt
,
with
a
brood
of
splashed
and
bespatter
geese
;
and
there
be
a
grim
-
visaged
dog
,
viciously
pant
in
a
doorway
,
who
would
certainly
have
have
Romeo
by
the
leg
,
the
moment
he
put
it
over
the
wall
,
if
he
have
exist
and
be
at
large
in
those
time
.
 
<EOS>
the
orchard
fall
into
other
hand
,
and
be
part
off
many
year
ago
;
but
there
use
to
be
one
attach
to
the
house
---
or
at
all
event
there
may
have
,
be
,
---
and
the
hat
(
Cappello
)
the
ancient
cognizance
of
the
family
,
may
still
be
see
,
carve
in
stone
,
over
the
gateway
of
the
yard
.
 
<EOS>
the
geese
,
the
market
-
cart
,
their
driver
,
and
the
dog
,
be
somewhat
in
the
way
of
the
story
,
it
must
be
confess
;
and
it
would
have
be
pleasanter
to
have
find
the
house
empty
,
and
to
have
be
able
to
walk
through
the
disuse
room
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
hat
be
unspeakably
comfortable
;
and
the
place
where
the
garden
use
to
be
,
hardly
less
so
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
the
house
be
a
distrustful
,
jealous
-
looking
house
as
one
would
desire
to
see
,
though
of
a
very
moderate
size
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
be
quite
satisfied
with
it
,
as
the
veritable
mansion
of
old
Capulet
,
and
be
correspondingly
grateful
in
my
acknowledgment
to
an
extremely
unsentimental
middle
-
aged
lady
,
the
Padrona
of
the
Hotel
,
who
be
lounge
on
the
threshold
look
at
the
geese
;
and
who
at
least
resemble
the
Capulets
in
the
one
particular
of
be
very
great
indeed
in
the
"
Family
"
way
.
  
<EOS>
from
Juliet
's
home
,
to
Juliet
's
tomb
,
be
a
transition
as
natural
to
the
visitor
,
as
to
fair
Juliet
herself
,
or
to
the
proud
Juliet
that
ever
have
teach
the
torch
to
burn
bright
in
any
time
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
I
go
off
,
with
a
guide
,
to
an
old
,
old
garden
,
once
belong
to
an
old
,
old
convent
,
I
suppose
;
and
be
admit
,
at
a
shatter
gate
,
by
a
bright
-
eyed
woman
who
be
wash
clothe
,
go
down
some
walk
where
fresh
plant
and
young
flower
be
prettily
grow
among
fragment
of
old
wall
,
and
ivy
-
colour
mound
;
and
be
show
a
little
tank
,
or
water
-
trough
,
which
the
bright
-
eyed
woman
---
dry
her
arm
upon
her
"
kerchief
,
call
"
La
tomba
di
Giulietta
la
sfortunata
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
with
the
good
disposition
in
the
world
to
believe
,
I
could
do
<EOS>
no
more
than
believe
that
the
bright
-
eyed
woman
believe
;
so
I
give
her
that
much
credit
,
and
her
customary
fee
in
ready
money
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
pleasure
,
rather
than
a
disappointment
,
that
Juliet
's
resting
-
place
be
forget
.
 
<EOS>
however
consolatory
it
may
have
be
to
Yorick
's
ghost
,
to
hear
the
foot
upon
the
pavement
overhead
,
and
,
twenty
time
a
day
,
the
repetition
of
his
name
,
it
be
well
for
Juliet
to
lie
out
of
the
track
of
tourist
,
and
to
have
no
visitor
but
such
as
come
to
grave
in
spring
-
rain

and
sweet

and
sunshine

<EOS>
in

be

<EOS>
so
well
preserved

that
every

be
there
,
unbroken
.
 
<EOS>
over
certain
of
the
arch
,
the
old
roman
numeral
may
yet
be
see

and
there
be
corridor
,
and
staircase
,
and
subterranean
passage
for
beast
,
and
wind
way
,
above
ground
and
below

as

the
fierce

intent

bloody

<EOS>
nestle
in

<EOS>
but
little

be

<EOS>
when
I
have
traverse
all
about

with
great
interest
,
and
have
go
up
to
the
topmost
round
of
seat
,
and
turn
from
the
lovely
panorama
<EOS>
close
in
by
the
distant
Alps
,
look
down
into
the
building
<EOS>
,
it
seem
to
lie
before
me
like
the
inside
of
a
prodigious
hat
of
plaited
straw
,
with
an
enormously
broad
brim
and
a
shallow
crown
;
<EOS>
the
plait
be
represent
by
the
four
-
and
-
forty
row
of
seat
.
 
<EOS>
the
comparison
be
a
homely
and
fantastic
one
,
in
sober
remembrance
and
on
paper
,
but
it
be
irresistibly
suggest
at
the
moment
,
nevertheless
.
  
<EOS>
an
equestrian
troop
have
be
there
,
a
short
time
before
---
the
same
troop
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
that
appear
to
the
old
lady
in
the
church
at
Modena
---
and
have
scoop
out
a
little
ring
at
one
end
of
the
area
;
where
their
performance
have
take
place
,
and
where
the
mark
of
their
horse
'
foot
be
still
fresh
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
picture
to
myself
,
a
handful
of
spectator
gather
together
on
one
or
two
of
the
old
stone
seat
,
and
a
spangle
Cavalier
be
gallant
,
or
a
Policinello
funny
,
with
the
grim
wall
look
on
.
 
<EOS>
above
all
<EOS>
,
I
think
how
strangely
those
roman
mute
would
gaze
upon
the
favourite
comic
scene
of
the
travel
English
,
where
a
british
nobleman
(
Lord
John
)
,
with
a
very
loose
stomach
:
 
dress
in
a
blue
-
tail
coat
down
to
his
heel
,
bright
yellow
breech
,
and
a
white
hat
:
 
come
abroad
,
ride
double
on
a
rearing
horse
,
with
an
english
lady
(
Lady
Betsy
)
in
a
straw
bonnet
and
green
veil
,
and
a
red
spencer
;
and
who
always
carry
a
gigantic
reticule
,
and
a
put
-
up
parasol
.
  
<EOS>
I
walk
through
and
through
the
town
all
the
rest
of
the
day
,
and
could
have
walk
there
until
now
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
place
,
there
be
a
very
pretty
modern
theatre
,
where
they
have
just
perform
the
opera
(
always
popular
in
Verona
)
of
Romeo
and
Juliet
.
 
<EOS>
in
another
there
be
a
collection
,
under
a
colonnade
,
of
Greek
,
Roman
,
and
etruscan
remain
,
preside
over
by
an
ancient
man
who
may
have
be
an
etruscan
relic
himself
;
for
he
be
not
strong
enough
to
open
the
iron
gate
,
when
he
have
unlock
it
,
and
have
neither
voice
enough
to
be
audible
when
he
describe
the
curiosity
,
nor
sight
enough
to
see
them
:
 
<EOS>
he
be
so
very
old
.
 
<EOS>
in
another
place
,
there
be
a
gallery
of
picture
:
 
so
abominably
bad
,
that
it
be
quite
delightful
to
see
them
moulder
away
.
 
<EOS>
but
anywhere
:
 
in
the
church
,
among
the
palace
,
in
the
street
,
on
the
bridge
,
or
down
beside
the
river
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
always
pleasant
Verona
,
and
in
my
remembrance
always
will
be
.
  
<EOS>
I
read
Romeo
and
Juliet
in
my
own
room
at
the
inn
that
night
---
of
course
,
no
Englishman
have
ever
read
it
there
,
before
---
and
set
out
for
Mantua
next
day
at
sunrise
,
repeat
to
myself
(
in
the
COUPE
of
an
omnibus
,
and
next
to
the
conductor
,
who
be
read
the
Mysteries
of
Paris
)
,
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
world
without
Verona
's
wall
but
purgatory
,
torture
,
hell
itself
.
<EOS>
hence
-
banish
be
banish
from
the
world
,
and
world
's
exile
be
death
---
  
which
remind
me
that
Romeo
be
only
banish
five
-
and
-
twenty
mile
after
all
,
and
rather
disturb
my
confidence
in
his
energy
and
boldness
.
  
<EOS>
be
the
way
to
Mantua
as
beautiful
,
in
his
time
,
I
wonder
!
 
<EOS>
do
it
wind
through
pasture
land
as
green
,
bright
with
the
same
glancing
stream
,
and
dot
with
fresh
clump
of
graceful
tree
!
 
<EOS>
those
purple
mountain
lie
on
the
horizon
,
then
,
for
certain
;
and
the
dress
of
these
peasant
girl
,
who
wear
a
great
,
knob
,
silver
pin
like
an
English
"
life
-
preserver
"
through
their
hair
behind
,
can
hardly
be
much
change
.
 
<EOS>
the
hopeful
feeling
of
so
bright
a
morning
,
and
so
exquisite
a
sunrise
,
can
have
be
no
stranger
,
even
to
an
exiled
lover
's
breast
;
and
Mantua
itself
must
have
break
on
him
in
the
prospect
,
with
its
tower
,
and
wall
,
and
water
,
pretty
much
as
on
a
common
-
place
and
matrimonial
omnibus
.
<EOS>
He
make
the
same
sharp
twist
and
turn
,
perhaps
,
over
two
rumble
drawbridge
;
pass
through
the
like
long
,
covered
,
wooden
bridge
;
and
leave
the
marshy
water
behind
,
approach
the
rusty
gate
of
stagnant
Mantua
.
  
<EOS>
if
ever
a
man
be
suit
to
his
place
of
residence
,
and
his
place
of
residence
to
him
,
the
lean
Apothecary
and
Mantua
come
together
in
a
perfect
fitness
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
more
stirring
then
,
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
if
so
,
the
Apothecary
be
a
man
in
advance
of
his
time
,
and
know
what
Mantua
would
be
,
in
eighteen
hundred
and
forty
-
four
.
<EOS>
He
fast
much
,
and
that
assist
him
in
his
foreknowledge
.
  
<EOS>
I
put
up
at
the
Hotel
of
the
Golden
Lion
,
and
be
in
my
own
room
arrange
plan
with
the
brave
Courier
,
when
there
come
a
modest
little
tap
at
the
door
,
which
open
on
an
outer
gallery
surround
a
court
-
yard
;
and
an
intensely
shabby
little
man
look
in
,
to
inquire
if
the
gentleman
would
have
a
cicerone
to
show
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
be
so
very
wistful
and
anxious
,
in
the
half
-
open
doorway
,
and
there
be
so
much
poverty
express
in
his
faded
suit
and
little
pinched
hat
,
and
in
the
thread
-
bare
worst
glove
with
which
he
hold
it
---
not
express
the
less
,
because
these
be
evidently
his
genteel
clothe
,
hastily
slip
on
---
that
I
would
as
soon
have
tread
on
him
as
dismiss
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
engage
him
on
the
instant
,
and
he
step
in
directly
.
  
<EOS>
while

"

<EOS>
I

he

<EOS>
"
then
,
when
we
have
see
the
two
large
church
yonder
,
what
shall
we
do
next
?
"
say
I.
  
He
look
up
the
street
,
and
down
the
street
,
and
rub
his
chin
timidly
;
and
then
say
,
glance
in
my
face
as
if
a
light
have
break
on
his
mind
,
yet
with
a
humble
appeal
to
my
forbearance
that
be
perfectly
irresistible
:
  
<EOS>
"
We
can
take
a
little
turn
about
the
town
,
Signore
!
"
 
<EOS>
(
si

un
piccolo
giro

citta
)
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
be
anything
but
delighted
with
the
proposal
,
so
we
set
off
together
in
great
good
-
humour
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
relief
of
his
mind
,
he
open
his
heart
,
and
give
up
as
much
of
Mantua
as
a
cicerone
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
one
must
eat
,
"
he
say
;
"
but
,
bah
!
<EOS>
it
be
a
dull
place
,
without
doubt
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
make
as
much
as
possible
of
the
Basilica
of
Santa
Andrea
---
a
noble
church
---
and
of
an
inclose
portion
of
the
pavement
,
about
which
taper
be
burn
,
and
a
few
people
kneel
,
and
under
which
be
say
to
be
preserve
the
Sangreal
of
the
old
Romances
.
<EOS>
this
church
dispose
of
,
and
another
after
it
(
the
cathedral
of
San
Pietro
)
,
we
go
to
the
Museum
,
which
be
shut
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
It

"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
much
inside
!
"
 
<EOS>
then
,
we
go
to
see
the
Piazza
del
Diavolo
,
build
by
the
Devil
(
for
no
particular
purpose
)
in
a
single
night
;
then
,
the
Piazza
Virgiliana
;
then
,
the
statue
of
Virgil
---
OUR
Poet
,
my
little
friend
say
,
pluck
up
a
spirit
,
for
the
moment
,
and
put
his
hat
a
little
on
one
side
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
we
go
to
a
dismal
sort
of
farm
-
yard
,
by
which
a
picture
-
gallery
be
approach
.
 
<EOS>
the
moment
the
gate
of
this
retreat
be
open
,
some
five
hundred
geese
come
waddle
round
us
,
stretch
out
their
neck
,
and
clamour
in
the
most
hideous
manner
,
as
if
they
be
ejaculate
,
"
oh
!
<EOS>
here
be
<EOS>
somebody
come
to
see
the
Pictures
!
 
<EOS>
do
not

up
!
 
<EOS>
do
not
go
up

"
 
<EOS>
while
we
go
up
,
they
wait
very
quietly
about
the
door
in
a
crowd
,
cackle
to
one
another
occasionally
,
in
a
subdued
tone
;
but
the
instant
we
appear
again
,
their
neck
come
out
like
telescope
,
and
set
up
a
great
noise
,
which
mean
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
<EOS>
"
what
,
you
would
go
,
would
you
!
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
of
it
!
 
<EOS>
how
do
you
like
it
!
"
<EOS>
they
attend
us
to
the
outer
gate
,
and
cast
us
forth
,
derisively
,
into
Mantua
.
  
<EOS>
the
geese
who
save
the
Capitol
,
be
,
as
compare
to
these
,
pork
to
the
learned
Pig
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
gallery
it
be
!
 
<EOS>
I
would
take
their
opinion
on
a
question
of
art
,
in
preference
to
the
discourse
of
Sir
Joshua
Reynolds
.
  
<EOS>
now
that
we
be
stand
in
the
street
,
after
be
thus
ignominiously
escort
thither
,
my
little
friend
be
plainly
reduce
to
the
"
piccolo
giro
,
"
or
little
circuit
of
the
town
,
he
have
formerly
propose
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
suggestion
that
we
should
visit
the
Palazzo
Te
(
of
which
I
have
hear
a
great
deal
,
as
a
strange
wild
place
)
impart
new
life
to
him
,
and
away
we
go
.
  
<EOS>
the
secret
of
the
length
of
Midas
's
ear
,
would
have
be
more
extensively
know
,
if
that
servant
of
his
,
who
whisper
it
to
the
reed
,
have
live
in
Mantua
,
where
there
be
reed
and
rush
enough
to
have
publish
it
to
all
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
the
Palazzo
Te
stand
in
a
swamp
,
among
this
sort
of
vegetation
;
and
be
,
indeed
,
as
singular
a
place
as
I
ever
see
.
  
<EOS>
not
for
its
dreariness
,
though
it
be
very
dreary
.
 
<EOS>
not
for
its
dampness
,
though
it
be
very
damp
.
 
<EOS>
nor
for
its
desolate
condition
,
though
it
be
as
desolate
and
neglect
as
house
can
be
.
 
<EOS>
but
chiefly
for
the
unaccountable
nightmare
with
which
its
interior
have
be
decorate
(
among
other
subject
of
more
delicate
execution
)
,
by
Giulio
Romano
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
leer
Giant
over
a
certain
chimney
-
piece
,
and
there
be
dozen
of
Giants
(
Titans
war
with
Jove
)
on
the
wall
of
another
room
,
so
inconceivably
ugly
and
grotesque
,
that
it
be
marvellous
how
any
man
can
have
imagine
such
creature
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
chamber
in
which
they
abound
,
these
monster
,
with
swollen
face
and
crack
cheek
,
and
every
kind
of
distortion
of
look
and
limb
,
be
depict
as
staggering
under
the
weight
of
fall
building
,
and
be
overwhelmed
in
the
ruin
;
upheave
masse
of
rock
,
and
bury
themselves
beneath
;
vainly
strive
to
sustain
the
pillar
of
heavy
roof
that
topple
down
upon
their
head
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
undergo
and
do
every
kind
of
mad
and
demoniacal
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
the
figure
be
immensely
large
,
and
exaggerate
to
the
utmost
pitch
of
uncouthness
;
the
colouring
be
harsh
and
disagreeable
;
and
the
whole
effect
more
like
(
I
should
imagine
)
a
violent
rush
of
blood
to
the
head
of
the
spectator
,
than
any
real
picture
set
before
him
by
the
hand
of
an
artist
.
 
<EOS>
this
apoplectic
performance
be
show
by
a
sickly
-
look
woman
,
whose
appearance
be
referable
,
I
dare
say
,
to
the
bad
air
of
the
marsh
;
but
it
be
difficult
to
help
feel
as
if
she
be
too
much
haunt
by
the
Giants
,
and
they
be
frighten
her
to
death
,
all
alone
in
that
exhausted
cistern
of
a
Palace
,
among
the
reed
and
rush
,
with
the
mist
hover
about
outside
,
and
stalk
round
and
round
it
continually
.
  
<EOS>
Our
walk
through
Mantua
show
us
,
in
almost
every
street
,
some
suppress
church
:
 
now
use
for
a
warehouse
,
now
for
nothing
at
all
:
 
all
as
crazy
and
dismantle
as
they
could
be
,
short
of
tumble
down
bodily
.
 
<EOS>
the
marshy
town
be
so
intensely
dull
and
flat
,
that
the
dirt
upon
it
seem
not
to
have
come
there
in
the
ordinary
course
,
but
to
have
settle
and
mantle
on
its
surface
as
on
stand
water
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
there
be
some
business
-
dealing
go
on
,
and
<EOS>
some
profit
realise
;
for
there
be
arcade
full
of
Jews
,
where
those
extraordinary
people
be
sit
outside
their
shop
,
contemplate
their
store
of
stuff
,
and
woollen
,
and
bright
handkerchief
,
and
trinket
:
 
and
look
,
in
all
respect
,
as
wary
and
business
-
like
,
as
their
brother
in
Houndsditch
,
London
.
  
<EOS>
have
select
a
Vetturino
from
among
the
neighbour
Christians
,
who
agree
to
carry
us
to
Milan
in
two
day
and
a
half
,
and
to
start
,
next
morning
,
as
soon
as
the
gate
be
open
,
I
return
to
the
Golden
Lion
,
and
dine
luxuriously
in
my
own
room
,
in
a
narrow
passage
between
two
bedstead
:
 
confront
by
a
smoky
fire
,
and
back
up
by
a
chest
of
drawer
.
 
<EOS>
at
six
o'clock
next
morning
,
we
be
jingle
in
the
dark
through
the
wet
cold
mist
that
enshroud
the
town
;
and
,
before
noon
,
the
driver
(
a
native
of
Mantua
,
and
sixty
year
of
age
or
thereabout
)
begin
to
ask
the
way
to
Milan
.
  
<EOS>
It
lie
through
Bozzolo
;
<EOS>
formerly
a
little
republic
,
and
now
one
of
the
most
deserted
and
poverty
-
stricken
of
town
:
 
where
the
landlord
of
the
miserable
inn
(
God
bless
him
!
<EOS>
it
be
his
weekly
custom
)
be
distribute
infinitesimal
coin
among
a
clamorous
herd
of
woman
and
child
,
whose
rag
be
flutter
in
the
wind
and
rain
outside
his
door
,
where
they
be
gather
to
receive
his
charity
.
 
<EOS>
It
lie
through
mist
,
and
mud
,
and
rain
,
and
vine
train
low
upon
the
ground
,
all
that
day
and
the
next
;
the
first
sleeping
-
place
be
Cremona
,
memorable
for
its
dark
brick
church
,
and
immensely
high
tower
,
the
Torrazzo
---
to
say
nothing
of
its
violin
,
of
which
it
certainly
produce
none
in
these
degenerate
day
;
and
the
second
,
Lodi
.
 
<EOS>
then
we
go
on
,
through
more
mud
,
mist
,
and
rain
,
and
marshy
ground
:
 
and
through
such
a
fog
,
as
Englishmen
,
strong
in
the
faith
of
their
own
grievance
,
be
apt
to
believe
be
nowhere
to
be
find
but
in
their
own
country
,
until
we
enter
the
paved
street
of
Milan
.
  
<EOS>
the
fog
be
so
dense
here
,
that
the
spire
of
the
far
-
famed
Cathedral
may
as
well
have
be
at
Bombay
,
for
anything
that
could
be
see
of
it
at
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
we
halt
to
refresh
,
for
a
few
day
then
,
and
return
to
Milan
again
next
summer
,
I
have
ample
opportunity
of
see
the
glorious
structure
in
all
its
majesty
and
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
all
christian
homage
to
the
saint
who
lie
within
it
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
many
good
and
true
saint
in
the
calendar
,
but
San
Carlo
Borromeo
have
---
if
I
may
quote
Mrs
Primrose
on
such
a
subject
---
"
my
warm
heart
.
"
 
<EOS>
a
charitable
doctor
to
the
sick
,
a
munificent
friend
to
the
poor
,
and
this
,
not
in
any
spirit
of
blind
bigotry
,
but
as
the
bold
opponent
of
enormous
abuse
in
the
romish
church
,
I
honour
his
memory
.
 
<EOS>
I
honour
it
none
the
less
,
because
he
be
nearly
slay
by
a
priest
,
suborn
,
by
priest
,
to
murder
him
at
the
altar
:
 
in
acknowledgment
of
his
endeavour
to
reform
a
false
and
hypocritical
brotherhood
of
monk
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
shield
all
imitator
of
San
Carlo
Borromeo
as
it
shield
him
!
 
<EOS>
a
reform
Pope
would
need
a
little
shielding
,
even
now
.
  
<EOS>
the
subterranean
chapel
in
which
the
body
of
San
Carlo
Borromeo
be
preserve
,
present
as
strike
and
as
ghastly
a
contrast
,
perhaps
,
as
any
place
can
show
.
 
<EOS>
the
taper
which
be
light
down
there
,
flash
and
gleam
on
alti

rilievi
in
gold
and
silver
,
delicately
work
by
skilful
hand
,
and
represent
the
principal
event
in
the
life
of
the
saint
.
 
<EOS>
Jewels
,
and
precious
metal
,
shine
and
sparkle
on
every
side
.
 
<EOS>
a
windlass
slowly
remove
the
front
of
the
altar
;
and
,
within
it
,
in
a
gorgeous
shrine
of
gold
and
silver
,
be
see
,
through
alabaster
,
the
shrivel
mummy
of
a
man
:
 
the
pontifical
robe
with
which
it
be
adorn
,
radiant
with
diamond
,
emerald
,
rubie
:
 
<EOS>
every
costly
and
magnificent
gem
.
 
<EOS>
the
shrunken
heap
of
poor
earth
in
the
midst
of
this
great
glitter
,
be
more
pitiful
than
if
it
lie
upon
a
dung
-
hill
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
ray
of
imprisoned
light
in
all
the
flash
and
fire
of
jewel
,
but
seem
to
mock
the
dusty
hole
where
eye
be
,
once
.
 
<EOS>
every
thread
of
silk
in
the
rich
vestment
seem
only
a
provision
from
the
worm
that
spin
,
for
the
behoof
of
worm
that
propagate
in
sepulchre
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
old
refectory
of
the
dilapidated
Convent
of
Santa
Maria
delle
Grazie
,
be
the
work
of
art
,
perhaps
,
better
know
than
any
other
in
the
world
:
 
the
last
supper
,
by
Leonardo
da
Vinci
---
with
a
door
cut
through
it
by
the
intelligent
dominican
friar
,
to
facilitate
their
operation
at
dinner
-
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
mechanically
acquaint
with
the
art
of
painting
,
and
have
no
other
mean
of
judging
of
a
picture
than
as
I
see
it
resemble
and
refining
upon
nature
,
and
present
graceful
combination
of
form
and
colour
.
 
<EOS>
I
be

therefore

no
authority
whatever
,
in
reference
to
the
"
touch
"
of
this
or
that
master
;
though
I
know
very
well
(
as
anybody
may
,
who
choose
to
think
about
the
matter
)
that
few
very
great
master
can
possibly
have
paint
,
in
the
compass
of
their
life
,
one
-
half
of
the
picture
that
bear
their
name
,
and
that
be
recognise
by
many
aspirant
to
a
reputation
for
taste
,
as
undoubted
original
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
,
by
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
of
the
last
supper
,
I
would
simply
observe
,
that
in
its
beautiful
composition
and
arrangement
,
there
it
be
,
at
Milan
,
a
wonderful
picture
;
and
that
,
in
its
original
colouring
,
or
in
its
original
expression
of
any
single
face
or
feature
,
there
it
be
not
.
 
<EOS>
apart
from
the
damage
it
have
sustain
from
damp
,
decay
,
or
neglect
,
it
have
be
(
as
Barry
show
)
<EOS>
so
retouch
upon
,
and
repaint
,
and
that
so
clumsily
,
that
many
of
the
head
be
,
now
,
positive
deformity
,
with
patch
of
paint
and
plaster
sticking
upon
them
like
wen
,
and
utterly
distort
the
expression
.
 
<EOS>
where
the
original
artist
set
that
impress
of
his
genius
on
a
face
,
which
,
almost
in
a
line
or
touch
,
separate
him
from
meaner
painter
and
make
him
what
he
be
,
succeed
bungler
,
fill
up
,
or
paint
across
seam
and
crack
,
have
be
quite
unable
to
imitate
his
hand
;
and
put
in
some
scowl
,
or
frown
,
or
wrinkle
,
of
their
own
,
have
blotch
and
spoil
the
work
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
so
well
establish
as
an
historical
fact
,
that
I
should
not
repeat
it
,
at
the
risk
of
be
tedious
,
but
for
have
observe
an
english
gentleman
before
the
picture
,
who
be
at
great
pain
to
fall
into
what
I
may
describe
as
mild
convulsion
,
at
certain
minute
detail
of
expression
which
be
not
leave
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Whereas
,
it
would
be
comfortable
and
rational
for
traveller
and
critic
to
arrive
at
a
general
understanding
that
it
can
not
fail
to
have
be
a
work
of
extraordinary
merit
,
once
:
when
,
with
so
few
of
its
original
beauty
remain
,
the
grandeur
of
the
general
design
be
yet
sufficient
to
sustain
it
,
as
a
piece
replete
with
interest
and
dignity
.
  
<EOS>
We
achieve
the
other
sight
of
Milan
,
in
due
course
,
and
a
fine
city
it
be
,
though
not
so
unmistakably
italian
as
to
possess
the
characteristic
quality
of
many
town
far
less
important
in
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
the
Corso
,
where
the
milanese
gentry
ride
up
and
down
in
carriage
,
and
rather
than
not
do
which
,
they
would
half
starve
themselves
at
home
,
be
a
most
noble
public
promenade
,
shade
by
long
avenue
of
tree
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
splendid
theatre
of
La
Scala
,
there
be
a
ballet
of
action
perform
after
the
opera
,
under
the
title
of
Prometheus
:
 
in
the
beginning
of
which
,
some
hundred
or
two
of
man
and
woman
represent
our
mortal
race
before
the
refinement
of
the
art
and
science
,
and
love
and
grace
,
come
on
earth
to
soften
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
anything
more
effective
.
 
<EOS>
generally
speak
,
the
pantomimic
action
of
the
Italians
be
more
remarkable
for
its
sudden
and
impetuous
character
than
for
its
delicate
expression
,
but
,
in
this
case
,
the
drooping
monotony
:
 
the
weary
,
miserable
,
listless
,
mope
life
:
 
the
sordid
passion
and
desire
of
human
creature
,
destitute
of
those
elevate
influence
to
which
we
owe
so
much
,
and
to
whose
promoter
we
render
so
little
:
be
express
in
a
manner
really
powerful
and
affecting
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
think
it
almost
impossible
to
present
such
an
idea
so
strongly
on
the
stage
,
without
the
aid
of
speech
.
  
<EOS>
Milan
soon
lie
behind
us
,
at
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
;
and
before
the
golden
statue
on
the
summit
of
the
cathedral
spire
be
lose
in
the
blue
sky
,
the
Alps
,
stupendously
confused
in
lofty
peak
and
ridge
,
cloud
and
snow
,
be
tower
in
our
path
.
  
<EOS>
still
,
we
continue
to
advance
toward
them
until
nightfall
;
and
,
all
day
long
,
the
mountain
top
present
strangely
shift
shape
,
as
the
road
display
them
in
different
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
the
beautiful
day
be
just
decline
,
when
we
come
upon
the
Lago
Maggiore
,
with
its
lovely
island
.
 
<EOS>
for
however
fanciful
and
fantastic
the
Isola
Bella
may
be
,
and
be
,
it
still
be
beautiful
.
<EOS>
anything
spring
out
of
that
blue
water
,
with
that
scenery
around
it
,
must
be
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
ten
o'clock
at
night
when
we
get
to
Domo
d'Ossola
,
at
the
foot
of
the
Pass
of
the
Simplon
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
the
moon
be
shine
brightly
,
and
there
be
not
a
cloud
in
the
starlit
sky
,
it
be
no
time
for
go
to
bed
,
or
go
anywhere
but
on
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
we
get
a
little
carriage
,
after
some
delay
,
and
begin
the
ascent
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
late
in
November
;
and
the
snow
lie
four
or
five
foot
thick
in
the
beaten
road
on
the
summit
(
in
other
part
the
new
drift
be
already
deep
)
,
the
air
be
pierce
cold
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
serenity
of
the
night
,
and
the
grandeur
of
the
road
,
with
its
impenetrable
shadow
,
and
deep
gloom
,
and
its
sudden
turn
into
the
shining
of
the
moon
and
its
incessant
roar
of
fall
water
,
render
the
journey
more
and
more
sublime
at
every
step
.
  
<EOS>
soon
leave
the
calm
italian
village
below
us
,
sleep
in
the
moonlight
,
the
road
begin
to
wind
among
dark
tree
,
and
after
a
time
emerge
upon
a
barer
region
,
very
steep
and
toilsome
,
where
the
moon
shine
bright
and
high
.
 
<EOS>
by
degree
,
the
roar
of
water
grow
louder
;
and
the
stupendous
track
,
after
cross
the
torrent
by
a
bridge
,
strike
in
between
two
massive
perpendicular
wall
of
rock
that
quite
shut
out
the
moonlight
,
and
only
leave
a
few
star
shine
in
the
narrow
strip
of
sky
above
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
even
this
be
lose
,
in
the
thick
darkness
of
a
cavern
in
the
rock
,
through
which
the
way
be
pierce
;
the
terrible
cataract
thundering
and
roar
close
below
it
,
and
its
foam
and
spray
hang
,
in
a
mist
,
about
the
entrance
.
 
<EOS>
emerge
from
this
cave
,
and
come
again
into
the
moonlight
,
and
across
a
dizzy
bridge
,
it
creep
and
twist
upward
,
through
the
Gorge
of
Gondo
,
savage
and
grand
beyond
description
,
with
smooth
-
front
precipice
,
rise
up
on
either
hand
,
and
almost
meet
overhead
.
 
<EOS>
thus
we
go
,
climb
on
our
rugged
way
,
high
and
high
all
night
,
without
a
moment
's
weariness
:
 
<EOS>
lose
in
the
contemplation
of
the
black
rock
,
the
tremendous
height
and
depth
,
the
field
of
smooth
snow
lie
,
in
the
cleft
and
hollow
,
and
the
fierce
torrent
thunder
headlong
down
the
deep
abyss
.
  
<EOS>
towards
daybreak
,
we
come
among
the
snow
,
where
a
keen
wind
be
blow
fiercely
.
 
<EOS>
have
,
with
some
trouble
,
awaken
the
inmate
of
a
wooden
house
in
this
solitude
:
 
round
which
the
wind
be
howl
dismally
,
catch
up
the
snow
in
wreath
and
hurl
it
away
:
 
we
get
some
breakfast
in
a
room
build
of
rough
timber
,
but
well
warm
by
a
stove
,
and
well
contrived
(
as
it
have
need
to
be
)
for
keep
out
the
bitter
storm
.
 
<EOS>
a
sledge
be
then
make
ready
,
and
four
horse
harness
to
it
,
we
go
,
plough
,
through
the
snow
.
 
<EOS>
still
upward
,
but
now
in
the
cold
light
of
morning
,
and
with
the
great
white
desert
on
which
we
travel
,
plain
and
clear
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
well
upon
the
summit
of
the
mountain
:
 
and
have
before
us
the
rude
cross
of
wood
,
denote
its
great
altitude
above
the
sea
:
 
when
the
light
of
the
rise
sun
,
strike
,
all
at
once
,
upon
the
waste
of
snow
,
and
turn
it
a
deep
red
.
 
<EOS>
the
lonely
grandeur
of
the
scene
be
then
at
its
height
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
go
sledge
on
,
there
come
out
of
the
Hospice
found
by
Napoleon
,
a
group
of
Peasant
traveller
,
with

have
rest
there
last

attend
by
a
Monk
or
two
,
their
hospitable
entertainer
,
trudge
slowly
forward
with
them
,
for
company
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
pleasant
to
give
them
good
morning
,
and
pretty
,
look
back
a
long
way
after
them
,
to
see
them
look
back
at
us
,
and
hesitate
presently
,
when
one
of
our
horse
stumble
and
fall
,
whether
or
no
they
should
return
and
help
us
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
soon
up
again
,
with
the
assistance
of
a
rough
waggoner
whose
team
have
stick
fast
there
too
;
and
when
we
have
help
him
out
of
his
difficulty
,
in
return
,
we
leave
him
slowly
plough
towards
them
,
and
go
slowly
and
swiftly
forward
,
on
the
brink
of
a
steep
precipice
,
among
the
mountain
pine
.
  
<EOS>
take
to
our

again
,
soon
afterwards

bury
themselves
in
the
unknown
gulf
beneath

<EOS>
down
,
over
lofty
bridge
,
and
through
horrible
ravine
:
 
a

shifting

in
the
vast
desolation
of
ice

snow
,
and
monstrous

down

<EOS>
some

it

pleasant

see
their

make
little

<EOS>
great

the

the

walk
there

I

<EOS>
It
be
not
in
such
a
season

however

that
we
traverse
this
road
on
our
way
to
Rome
.
 
<EOS>
the
middle
of
January
be
only
just
past
,
and
it
be
very
gloomy
and
dark
weather
;
very
wet
besides
.
 
<EOS>
in
cross
the
fine
pass
of
Bracco
,
we
encounter
such
a
storm
of
mist
and
rain
,
that
we
travel
in
a
cloud
the
whole
way
.
 
<EOS>
there
may
have
be
no
Mediterranean
in
the
world
,
for
anything
that
we
see
of
it
there
,
except
when
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
,
clear
the
mist
before
it
,
for
a
moment
,
show
the
agitated
sea
at
a
great
depth
below

lash
the
distant
rock
,
and
spout
up
its
foam
furiously
.
 
<EOS>
the
rain
be
incessant
;
every
brook
and
torrent
be
greatly
swollen
;
and
<EOS>
such
a
deafening
leaping
,
and
roaring
,
and
thundering
of
water
<EOS>
,
I
never
hear
the
like
of
in
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
hence
,
when
we
come
to
Spezzia
,
we
find
that
the
Magra
,
an
unbridged
river
on
the
high
-
road
to
Pisa
,
be
too
high
to
be
safely
cross
in
the
Ferry
Boat
,
and
be
fain
to
wait
until
the
afternoon
of
next
day
,
when
it
have
,
in
some
degree
,
subside
.
<EOS>
spezzia
,
however
,
be
a
good
place
to
tarry
at
;
by
reason
,
firstly
,
of
its
beautiful
bay
;
secondly
,
of
its
ghostly
Inn
;
thirdly
,
of
the
head
-
dress
of
the
woman
,
who
wear
,
on
one
side
of
their
head
,
a
small
doll
's
straw
hat
,
stick
on
to
the
hair
;
which
be
certainly
the
oddest
and
most
roguish
head
-
gear
that
ever
be
invent
.
  
<EOS>
the
Magra
safely
cross
in
the
Ferry
Boat
---
the
passage
be
not
by
any
mean
agreeable
,
when
the
current
be
swollen
and
strong
---
we
arrive
at
Carrara
,
within
a
few
hour
.
 
<EOS>
in
good
time
next
morning
,
we
get
some
pony
,
and
go
out
to
see
the
marble
quarry
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
four
or
five
great
glen
,
run
up
into
a
range
of
lofty
hill
,
until
they
can
run
no
longer
,
and
be
stop
by
be
abruptly
strangle
by
Nature
.
 
<EOS>
the
quarry
,
"
or
cave
,
"
as
they
call
them
there
,
be
so
many
opening
,
high
up
in
the
hill
,
on
either
side
of
these
pass
,
where
they
blast
and
excavate
for
marble
:
 
which
may
turn
out
good
or
bad
:
 
may
make
a
man
's
fortune
very
quickly
,
or
ruin
him
by
the
great
expense
of
work
what
be
worth
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
these
cave
be
open
by
the
ancient
Romans
,
and
remain
as
they
leave
them
to
this
hour
.
 
<EOS>
many
other
be
be
work
at
this
moment
;
other
be
to
be
begin
to

morrow
,
next
week
,
next
month

other
be
unbought
,
unthought
of

and
marble
enough
for
more
age
than
have
pass
since
the
place
be
resort
to
,
lie
hide
everywhere
:
 
patiently
await
its
time
of
discovery
.
  
<EOS>
as
you
toil
and
clamber
up
one
of
these
steep
gorge
<EOS>
(
have
leave
your
pony
soddene
his
girth
in
water
,
a
mile
or
two
low
down
)
<EOS>
you
hear
,
every
now
and
then
,
echo
among
the
hill
,
in
a
low
tone
,
more
silent
than
the
previous
silence
,
a
melancholy
warning
bugle
,
---
a
signal
to
the
miner
to
withdraw
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
there
be
a
thundering
,
and
echo
from
hill
to
hill
,
and
perhaps
a
splashing
up
of
great
fragment
of
rock
into
the
air
;
and
on
you
toil
again
until
some
other
bugle
sound
,
in
a
new
direction
,
and
you
stop
directly
,
lest
you
should
come
within
the
range
of
the
new
explosion
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
number
of
man
,
work
high
up
in
these
hill
---
on
the
side
---
clear
away
,
and
send
down
the
broken
masse
of
stone
and
earth
,
to
make
way
for
the
block
of
marble
that
have
be
discover
.
 
<EOS>
as
these
come
roll
down
from
unseen
hand
into
the
narrow
valley
,
I
could
not
help
think
of
the
deep
glen
(
just
the
same
sort
of
glen
)
where
the
Roc
leave
Sindbad
the
Sailor
;
and
where
the
merchant
from
the
height
above
,
fling
down
great
piece
of
meat
for
the
diamond
to
stick
to
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
eagle
here
,
to
darken
the
sun
in
their
swoop
,
and
pounce
upon
them
;
but
it
be
as
wild
and
fierce
as
if
there
have
be
hundred
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
road
,
the
road
down
which
the
marble
come
,
however
immense
the
block
!
<EOS>
the
genius
of
the
country
,
and
the
spirit
of
its
institution
,
pave
that
road
:
 
repair
it
,
watch
it
,
keep
it
go
!
<EOS>
conceive
a
channel
of
water
run
over
a
rocky
bed
,
beset
with
great
heap
of
stone
of
all
shape
and
size
,
wind
down
the
middle
of
this
valley
;
and
that
be
the
road
---
because
it
be
the
road
five
hundred
year
ago
!
 
<EOS>
imagine
the
clumsy
cart
of
five
hundred
year
ago
,
be
use
to
this
hour
,
and
draw
,
as
they
use
to
be

five
hundred
year

,
by
oxen
,
whose
ancestor
be
wear
to
death
five
hundred
year

,
as
their
unhappy
descendant
be
now
,
in
twelve
month

by
the
suffering

agony
of
this
cruel
work

<EOS>
two
pair
,
four
pair
,
ten
pair
,
twenty

to
one
block

accord
to
its
size

down
it
must
come

this
way

<EOS>
in
their
struggling
from
stone
to
stone
,
with
their
enormous
load
behind
them
,
they
die
frequently
upon
the
spot
;
and
not
they
alone
;
for
their
passionate
driver
,
sometimes
tumble
down
in
their
energy
,
be
crush
to
death
beneath
the
wheel
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
good
five
hundred
year
ago
,
and
it
must
be
good
now
:
 
and
a
railroad
down
one
of
these
steep
(
the
easy
thing
in
the
world
)
would
be
flat
blasphemy
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
stand
aside
,
to
see
one
of
these
car
draw
by
only
a
pair
of
oxen
(
for
it
have
but
one
small
block
of
marble
on

come
down

I
hail
,
in
my
heart
,
the
man
who
sit
upon
the
heavy
yoke
,
to
keep
it
on
the
neck
of
the
poor
beast
---
and
who
face
backwards
:
 
not
before
him
---
as
the
very
Devil
of
true
despotism
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
great
rod
in
his
hand
,
with
an
iron
point
;
and
when
they
could
plough
and
force
their
way
through
the
loose
bed
of
the
torrent
no
longer
,
and
come
to
a
stop
,
he
poke
it
into
their
body
,
beat
it
on
their
head
,
screw
it
round
and
round
in
their
nostril
,
get
them
on
a
yard
or
two
,
in
the
madness
of
intense
pain
;
repeat
all
these
persuasion
,
with
increase
intensity
of
purpose
,
when
they
stop
again
;
get
them
on
,
once
more
;
force
and
goad
them
to
an
abrupter
point
of
the
descent
;
and
when
their
writhing
and
smart
,
and
the
weight
behind
them
,
bear
them
plunge
down
the
precipice
in
a
cloud
of
scatter
water
,
whirl
his
rod
above
his
head
,
and
give
a
great
whoop
and
hallo
,
as
if
he
have
achieve
something
,
and
have
no
idea
that
they
may
shake
him
off
,
and
blindly
mash
his
brain
upon
the
road
,
in
the
noon
-
tide
of
his
triumph
.
  
<EOS>
stand
in
one
of
the
many
studii
of
Carrara
,
that
afternoon
<EOS>
---
for
it
be
a
great
workshop
,
full
of
beautifully
-
finish
copy
in
marble
,
of
almost
every
figure
,
group
,
and
bust
,
we
know
---
it
seem
,
at
first
,
so
strange
to
me
that
those
exquisite
shape
,
replete
with
grace
,
and
think
,
and
delicate
repose
,
should
grow
out
of
all
this
toil
,
and
sweat
,
and
torture
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
soon
find
a
parallel
to
it
,
and
an
explanation
of
it
,
in
every
virtue
that
spring
up
in
miserable
ground
,
and
every
good
thing
that
have
its
birth
in
sorrow
and
distress
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
look
out
of
the
sculptor

great
window
,
upon
the
marble
mountain
,
all
red
and
glow
in
the
decline
of
day
,
but
stern
and
solemn
to
the
last
,
I
think
,
my
God
!
<EOS>
how
many
quarry
of
human
heart
and
soul
,
capable
of
far
more
beautiful
result
,
be
leave
shut
up
and
moulder
away
:
while
pleasure

traveller
through
life
,
avert
their
face
,
as
they
pass
,
and
shudder
at
the
gloom
and
ruggedness
that
conceal
them
!
  
<EOS>
the

Duke

to

this

and
if
certain
line
in
contemplation
by
other
potentate
,
on
either
side
of
him
,
have
be
execute
,
would
have
probably
enjoy
the
satisfaction
of
have
an
omnibus
ply
to

fro
across
his
not
very
vast
dominion
,
to
forward
traveller
from
one
terminus
to
another
.
  
<EOS>
Carrara
,
shut
in
by
great
hill
,
be
very
picturesque
and
bold
.
 
<EOS>
few
tourist
stay
there
;
and
the
people
be
nearly
all
connect
,
in
one
way
or
other
,
with
the
working
of
marble
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
also
village
among
the
cave
,
where
the
workman
live
.
 
<EOS>
It
contain
a
beautiful
little
Theatre
,
newly
build
;
and
it
be
an
interesting
custom
there
,
to
form
the
chorus
of
labourer
in
the
marble
quarry
,
who
be
self
-
teach
and
sing
by
ear
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
them
in
a
comic
opera
,
and
in
an
act
of
"
Norma
;
"
and
they
acquit
themselves
very
well
;
unlike
the
common
people
of
Italy
generally
,
who
(
with
some
exception
among
the
Neapolitans
)
sing
vilely
out
of
tune
,
and
have
very
disagreeable
singing
voice
.
  
<EOS>
from
the
summit
of
a
lofty
hill
beyond
Carrara
,
the
first
view
of
the
fertile
plain
in
which
the
town
of
Pisa
lie
---
with
Leghorn
,
a
purple
spot
in
the
flat
distance
---
be
enchanting
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
it
only
distance
that
lend
enchantment
to
the
view
;
for
the
fruitful
country
,
and
rich
wood
of
olive
-
tree
through
which
the
road
subsequently
pass
,
render
it
delightful
.
  
<EOS>
the
moon
be
shine
when
we
approach
Pisa
,
and
for
a
long
time
we
could
see
,
behind
the
wall
,
the
leaning
Tower
,
all
awry
in
the
uncertain
light
;
the
shadowy
original
of
the
old
picture
in
school
-
book
,
set
forth
"
the
Wonders
of
the
World
.
"
 
<EOS>
like
most
thing
connect
in
their
first
association
with
school
-
book
and
school
-
time
,
it
be
too
small
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
it
keenly
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
nothing
like
so
high
above
the
wall
as
I
have
hope
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
another
of
the
many
deception
practise
by
Mr
Harris
,
Bookseller
,
at
the
corner
of
St
Paul
's
Churchyard
,
London
.
 
<EOS>
his
Tower
be
a
fiction
,
but
this
be
a
reality
---
and
,
by
comparison
,
a
short
reality
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
it
look
very
well
,
and
very
strange
,
and
be
quite
as
much
out
of
the
perpendicular
as
Harris
have
represent
it
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
the
quiet
air
of
Pisa
too
;
the
big
guard
-
house
at
the
gate
,
with
only
two
little
soldier
in
it
;
the
street
with
scarcely
any
show
of
people
in
them
;
and
the
Arno
,
flow
quaintly
through
the
centre
of
the
town
;
be
excellent
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
I
bear
no
malice
in
my
heart
against
Mr
Harris
(
remember
his
good
intention
)
,
but
forgave
him
before
dinner
,
and
go
out
,
full
of
confidence
,
to
see
the
Tower
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
I
may
have
know
better
;
but
,
somehow
,
I
have
expect
to
see
it
,
cast
its
long
shadow
on
a
public
street
where
people
come
and
go
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
surprise
to
me
to
find
it
in
a
grave
retired
place
,
apart
from
the
general
resort
,
and
carpet
with
smooth
green
turf
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
group
of
building
,
cluster
on
and
about
this
verdant
carpet
:
 
comprise
the
Tower
,
the
Baptistery
,
the
Cathedral
,
and
the
Church
of
the
Campo
Santo
:
 
be
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
and
beautiful
in
the
whole
world
;
and
from
be
cluster
there
,
together
,
away
from
the
ordinary
transaction
and
detail
of
the
town
,
they
have
a
singularly
venerable
and
impressive
character
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
architectural
essence
of
a
rich
old
city
,
with
all
its
common
life
and
common
habitation
press
out
,
and
filter
away
.
  
<EOS>
simond
compare
the
Tower
to
the
usual
pictorial
representation
in
child
's
book
of
the
Tower
of
Babel
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
happy
simile
,
and
convey
a
well
idea
of
the
building
than
chapter
of
laboured
description
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
can
exceed
the
grace
and
lightness
of
the
structure
;
nothing
can
be
more
remarkable
than
its
general
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
the
ascent
to
the
top
(
which
be
by
an
easy
staircase
)
,
the
inclination
be
not
very
apparent
;
but
,
at
the
summit
,
it
become
so
,
and
give
one
the
sensation
of
be
in
a
ship
that
have
heel
over
,
through
the
action
of
an
ebb
-
tide
.
 
<EOS>
the
effect
upon
the
LOW
SIDE
,
so
to
speak
---
look
over
from
the
gallery
,
and
see
the
shaft
recede
to
its
base
---
be
very
startling
;
and
I
see
a
nervous
traveller
hold
on
to
the
Tower
involuntarily
,
after
glance
down
,
as
if
he
have
some
idea
of
prop
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
the
view
within
,
from
the
ground
---
look
up
,
as
through
a
slanted
tube
---
be
also
very
curious
.
 
<EOS>
It
certainly
incline
as
much
as
the
most
sanguine
tourist
could
desire
.
 
<EOS>
the
natural
impulse
of
ninety
-
nine
people
out
of
a
hundred
,
who
be
about
to
recline
upon
the
grass
below
it
,
to
rest
,
and
contemplate
the
adjacent
building
,
would
probably
be
,
not
to
take
up
their
position
under
the
lean
side
;
it
be
so
very
much
aslant
.
  
<EOS>
the
manifold
beauty
of
the
Cathedral
and
Baptistery
need
no
recapitulation
from
me
;
though
in
this
case
,
as
in
a
hundred
other
,
I
find
it
difficult
to
separate
my
own
delight
in
recall
them
,
from
your
weariness
in
have
them
recall
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
picture
of
St
Agnes
,
by
Andrea
del
Sarto
,
in
the
former
,
and
there
be
a
variety
of
rich
column
in
the
latter
,
that
tempt
me
strongly
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
,
I
hope
,
no
breach
of
my
resolution
not
to
be
tempt
into
elaborate
description
,
to
remember
the
Campo
Santo
;
where
grass
-
grow
grave
be
dig
in
earth
bring
more
than
six
hundred
year
ago
,
from
the
Holy
Land
;
and
where
there
be
,
surround
them
,
<EOS>
such
cloister
,
with
such
playing
light
and
shadow
fall
through
their
delicate
tracery
on
the
stone
pavement
,
as
surely
the
dull
memory
could
never
forget
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
wall
of
this
solemn
and
lovely
place
,
be
ancient
fresco
,
very
much
obliterated
and
decay
,
but
very
curious
.
 
<EOS>
as
usually
happen
in
almost
any
collection
of
painting
,
of
any
sort
,
in
Italy
,
where
there
be
many
head
,
there
be
,
in
one
of
them
,
a
striking
accidental
likeness
of
Napoleon
.
 
<EOS>
at
one
time
,
I
use
to
please
my
fancy
with
the
speculation
whether
these
old
painter
,
at
their
work
,
have
a
foreboding
knowledge
of
the
man
who
would
one
day
arise
to
wreak
such
destruction
upon
art
:
 
whose
soldier
would
make
target
of
great
picture
,
and
stable
their
horse
among
triumph
of
architecture
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
same
corsican
face
be
so
plentiful
in
some
part
of
Italy
at
this
day
,
that
a
more
commonplace
solution
of
the
coincidence
be
unavoidable
.
  
<EOS>
if
Pisa
be
the
seventh
wonder
of
the
world
in
right
of
its
Tower
,
it
may
claim
to
be
,
at
least
,
the
second
or
third
in
right
of
its
beggar
.
 
<EOS>
They
waylay
the
unhappy
visitor
at
every
turn
,
escort
him
to
every
door
he
enter
at
,
and
lie
in
wait
for
him
,
with
strong
reinforcement
,
at
every
door
by
which
they
know
he
must
come
out
.
<EOS>
the
grating
of
the
portal
on
its
hinge
be
the
signal
for
a
general
shout
,
and
the
moment
he
appear
,
he
be
hem
in
,
and
fall
on
,
by
heap
of
rag
and
personal
distortion
.
 
<EOS>
the
beggar
seem
to
embody
all
the
trade
and
enterprise
of
Pisa
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
else
be
stirring
,
but
warm
air
.
 
<EOS>
go
through
the
street
,
the
front
of
the
sleepy
house
look
like
back
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
all
so
still
and
quiet
,
and
unlike
house
with
people
in
them
,
that
the
great
part
of
the
city
have
the
appearance
of
a
city
at
daybreak
,
or
during
a
general
siesta
of
the
population
.
 
<EOS>
or
it
be
yet
more
like
those
background
of
house
in
common
print
,
or
old
engraving
,
where
window
and
door
be
squarely
indicate
,
and
one
figure
(
a
beggar
of
course
)
be
see
walk
off
by
itself
into
illimitable
perspective
.
  
<EOS>
not
so
Leghorn
(
make
illustrious
by
SMOLLETT
's
grave
)
,
which
be
a
thriving
,
business
-
like
,
matter
-
of
-
fact
place
,
where
idleness
be
shoulder
out
of
the
way
by
commerce
.
 
<EOS>
the
regulation
observe
there
,
in
reference
to
trade
and
merchant
,
be
very
liberal
and
free
;
and
the
town
,
of
course
,
benefit
by
them
.
 
<EOS>
Leghorn
have
a
bad
name
in
connection
with
stabber
,
and
with
some
justice
it
must
be
allow
;
for
,
not
many
year
ago
,
there
be
an
assassination
club
there
,
the
member
of
which
bear
no
ill
-
will
to
anybody
in
particular
,
but
stab
people
<EOS>
(
quite
stranger
to
them
)
in
the
street
at
night
,
for
the
pleasure
and
excitement
of
the
recreation
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
the
president
of
this
amiable
society
be
a
shoemaker
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
take
,
however
,
and
the
club
be
break
up
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
,
probably
,
have
disappear
in
the
natural
course
of
event
,
before
the
railroad
between
Leghorn
and
Pisa
,
which
be
a
good
one
,
and
have
already
begin
to
astonish
Italy
with
a
precedent
of
punctuality
,
order
,
plain
dealing
,
and
improvement
---
the
most
dangerous
and
heretical
astonisher
of
all
.
 
<EOS>
there
must
have
be
a
slight
sensation
,
as
of
earthquake
,
surely
,
in
the
Vatican
,
when
the
first
italian
railroad
be
throw
open
.
  
<EOS>
return
to
Pisa
,
and
hire
a
good
-
tempered
Vetturino
,
and
his
four
horse
,
to
take
us
on
to
Rome
,
we
travel
through
pleasant
tuscan
village
and
cheerful
scenery
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
the
roadside
crosse
in
this
part
of
Italy
be
numerous
and
curious
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
seldom
a
figure
on
the
cross
,
though
there
be
sometimes
a
face
,
but
they
be
remarkable
for
be
garnish
with
little
model
in
wood
,
of
every
possible
object
that
can
be
connect
with
the
Saviour
's
death
.
<EOS>
the
cock
that
crow
when
Peter
have
deny
his
Master
thrice
,
be
usually
perch
on
the
tip

top
;
and
an
ornithological
phenomenon
he
generally
be
.
 
<EOS>
under
him
,
be
the
inscription
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
hang
on

the
cross

be
the
spear
,
the
reed
with
the
sponge
of
vinegar
and
water
at

the

which
Mary

I
suppose
)
,
and

<EOS>
a
perfect
toy

shop
of
little

five
mile
,
all
along
the
highway
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
from
Pisa
,
we
reach
the
beautiful
old
city
of
Siena
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
what
they
call
a
Carnival
,
in
progress
;
but
,
as
its
secret
lie
in
a
score
or
two
of
melancholy
people
walk
up
and
down
the
principal
street
in
common
toy
-
shop
mask
,
and
be
more
melancholy
,
if
possible
,
than
the
same
sort
of
people
in
England
<EOS>
,
I
say
no
more
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
go
off
,
betime
next
morning
,
to
see
the
Cathedral
,
which
be
wonderfully
picturesque
inside
and
out
,
especially
the
latter
---
also
the
market
-
place
,
or
great
Piazza
,
which
be
a
large
square
,
with
a
great
break
-
nosed
fountain
in
it
:
 
<EOS>
some
quaint
gothic
house
:
 
and
a
high
square
brick
tower
;
outside
the
top
of
which
---
a
curious
feature
in
such
view
in
Italy
---
hang
an
enormous
bell
.
<EOS>
It
be
like
a
bit
of
Venice
,
without
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
some
curious
old
Palazzi
in
the
town
,
which
be
very
ancient
;
and
without
have
(
for
me
)
the
interest
of
Verona
,
or
Genoa
,
it
be
very
dreamy
and
fantastic
,
and
most
interesting
.
  
<EOS>
We
go
on
again
,
as
soon
as
we
have
see
these
thing
,
and
go
over
a
rather
bleak
country
(
there
have
be
nothing
but
vine
until
now
:
 
<EOS>
mere
walking
-
stick
at
that
season
of
the
year
)
,
stop
,
as
usual
,
between
one
and
two
hour
in
the
middle
of
the
day
,
to
rest
the
horse
;
that
be
a
part
of
every
Vetturino
contract
.
 
<EOS>
We
then
go
on
again
,
through
a
region
gradually
become
bleaker
and
wild
,
until
it
become
as
bare
and
desolate
as
any
scottish
moor
.
<EOS>
soon
after
dark
,
we
halt
for
the
night
,
at
the
osteria
of
La
Scala
:
 
a
perfectly
lone
house
,
where
the
family
be
sit
round
a
great
fire
in
the
kitchen
,
raise
on
a
stone
platform
three
or
four
foot
high
,
and
big
enough
for
the
roasting
of
an
ox
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
upper
,
and
only
other
floor
of
this
hotel
,
there
be
a
great
,
wild

ramble
sala
,
with
one
very
little
window
in
a

corner
,
and
four
black
door
open
into
four
black
bedroom
in
various

<EOS>
to

nothing

another
large
black
door

open
into
another
large
black
sala
,
with
the
staircase
come
abruptly
through
a
kind
of
trap
-
door
in
the
floor
,
and
the
rafter
of
the
roof
loom
above
:
 
a
suspicious
little
press
skulk
in
one
obscure
corner
:
and
all
the
knife
in
the
house
lie
about
in
various
direction
.
<EOS>
the
fireplace
be
of
the
pure
italian
architecture
,
so
that
it
be
perfectly
impossible
to
see
it
for
the
smoke
.
 
<EOS>
the
waitress
be
like

<EOS>
We

dinner
in

solitary

and
a
very
good
dinner
it
be
,
when
you
be
use

it

<EOS>
there
be
something
with
a

some

there

You

<EOS>
It
be
a
bad
morning
when
we
leave
this
place
;
and
we
go
,
for
twelve
mile
,
over
a
country
as
barren
,
as
stony
,
and
as
wild
,
as
Cornwall
in
England
,
until
we
come
to
Radicofani
,
where
there
be
a
ghostly
,
goblin
inn
:
 
once
a
hunting
-
seat
,
belong
to
the
Dukes
of
Tuscany
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
full
of
such
rambling
corridor
,
and
gaunt
room
,
that
all
the
murdering
and
phantom
tale
that
ever
be
write
may
have
originate
in
that
one
house
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
some
horrible
old
Palazzi
in
Genoa
:
 
one
in
particular
,
not
unlike
it
,
outside

<EOS>
but
there
be
a
winding

creaking

wormy

rustling
,
door

opening

fall
character

this
Radicofani

such

<EOS>
the

such

hang

and
in

of
it

<EOS>
the
inhabitant
be
all
beggar
;
and
as
soon
as
they
see
a
carriage
come
,
they
swoop
down
upon
it
,
like
so
many
bird
of
prey
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
get
on
the
mountain
pass
,
which
lie
beyond
this
place
,
the
wind
<EOS>
(
as
they
have
forewarn
us
at
the
inn
)
be
so
terrific

that
we
be
oblige
to
take
my
other
half
out
of
the
carriage
,
lest
she
should
be
blow
over
,
carriage
and
all
,
and
to
hang
to
it
,
on
the
windy
side
(
as
well
as
we
could
for
laugh
)
,
to
prevent
its
going
,
Heaven
know
where
.
 
<EOS>
for
mere
force
of
wind
,
this
land
-
storm
may
have
compete
with
an
Atlantic
gale
,
and
have
a
reasonable
chance
of
come
off
victorious
.
 
<EOS>
the
blast
come
sweep
down
great
gully
in
a
range
of
mountain
on
the
right
:
 
so
that
we
look
with
positive
awe
at
a
great
morass
on
the
left
,
and
see
that
there
be
not
a
bush
or
twig
to
hold
by
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
,
once
blow
from
our
foot
,
we
must
be
sweep
out
to
sea
,
or
away
into
space
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
snow
,
and
hail
,
and
rain
,
and
lightning
,
and
thunder
;
and
there
be
roll
mist
,
travel
with
incredible
velocity
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
dark
,
awful
,
and
solitary
to
the
last
degree
;
there
be
mountain
above
mountain
,
veil
in
angry
cloud
;
and
there
be
such
a
wrathful
,
rapid
,
violent
,
tumultuous
hurry
,
everywhere
,
as
render
the
scene
unspeakably
exciting
and
grand
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
relief
to
get
out
of
it
,
notwithstanding
;
and
to
cross
even
the
dismal
,
dirty
Papal
Frontier
.
 
<EOS>
after
pass
through
two
little
town
;
in
one
of
which
,
Acquapendente
,
there
be
also
a
"
Carnival
"
in
progress
:
 
consist
of
one

dress
and
mask
as
a
woman
,
and
one
woman
dress
and
mask
as
a
man
,
walk
ankle
<EOS>
-
deep
,
through
the
muddy
street
,
in
a
very
melancholy
manner
:
we
come
,
at
dusk
,
within
sight
of
the
Lake
of
Bolsena
,
on
whose
bank
there
be
a
little
town
of
the
same
name
,
much
celebrate
for
malaria
.
 
<EOS>
with
the
exception
of
this
poor
place
,
there
be
not
a
cottage
on
the
bank
of
the
lake
,
or
near
it
(
for
nobody
dare
sleep
there
)
;
not
a
boat
upon
its
water
;
not
a
stick
or
stake
to
break
the
dismal
monotony
of
seven
-
and
-
twenty
watery
mile
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
late
in
get
in
,
the
road
be
very
bad
from
heavy
rain
;
and
,
after
dark
,
the
dulness
of
the
scene
be
quite
intolerable
.
  
<EOS>
We
enter
on
a
very
different
,
and
a
fine
scene
of
desolation
,
next
night
,
at
sunset
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
pass
through
Montefiaschone
(
famous
for
its
wine
)
and
Viterbo
(
for
its
fountain
)
<EOS>
:
 
<EOS>
and
after
climb
up
a
long
hill
of
eight
or
ten
mile
'
extent
,
come
suddenly
upon
the
margin
of
a
solitary
lake
:
 
in
one
part
very
beautiful
,
with
a
luxuriant
wood
;
in
another
,
very
barren
,
and
shut
in
by
bleak
volcanic
hill
.
 
<EOS>
where
this
lake
flow
,
there
stand
,
of
old
,
a
city
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
swallow
up
one
day
;
and
in
its
stead
,
this
water
rise
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
ancient
tradition
(
common
to
many
part
of
the
world
)
of
the
ruin
city
have
be
see
below
,
when
the
water
be
clear
;
but
however
that
may
be
,
from
this
spot
of
earth
it
vanish
.
 
<EOS>
the
ground
come
bubble
up
above
it
;
and
the
water
too
;
and
here
they
stand
,
like
ghost
on
whom
the
other
world
close
suddenly
,
and
who
have
no
means
of
get
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
They
seem
to
be
wait
the
course
of
age
,
for
the
next
earthquake
in
that
place
;
when
they
will
plunge
below
the
ground
,
at
its
first
yawning
,
and
be
see
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
the
unhappy
city
below
,
be
not
more
lost
and
dreary
,
than
these
fire
-
char
hill
and
the
stagnant
water
,
above
.
 
<EOS>
the
red
sun
look
strangely
on
them
,
as
with
the
knowledge
that
they
be
make
for
cavern
and
darkness
;
and
the
melancholy
water
ooze
and
suck
the
mud
,
and
creep
quietly
among
the
marshy
grass
and
reed
,
as
if
the
overthrow
of
all
the
ancient
tower
and
house
-
top
,
and
the
death
of
all
the
ancient
people
bear
and
breed
there
,
be
yet
heavy
on
its
conscience
.
  
<EOS>
a
short
ride
from
this
lake
,
bring
us
to
Ronciglione
;
a
little
town
like
a
large
pig
-
sty
,
where
we
pass
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
next
morning
at
seven
o'clock
,
we
start
for
Rome
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
we
be
out
of
the
pig
-
sty
,
we
enter
on
the
Campagna
Romana
;
an
undulate
flat
(
as
you
know
)
,
where
few
people
can
live
;
and
where
,
for
mile
and
mile
<EOS>
,
there
be
nothing
to
relieve
the
terrible
monotony
and
gloom
.
 
<EOS>
of
all
kind
of
country
that
could
,
by
possibility
,
lie
outside
the
gate
of
Rome
,
this
be
the
apt
and
fit
burial
-
ground
for
the
Dead
City
.
 
<EOS>
so
sad
,
so
quiet
,
so
sullen
;
so
secret
in
its
covering
up
of
great
masse
of
ruin
,
and
hide
them
;
so
like
the
waste
place
into
which
the
man
possess
with
devil
use
to
go
and
howl
,
and
rend
themselves
,
in
the
old
day
of
Jerusalem
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
to
traverse
thirty
mile
of
this
Campagna
;
and
for
two
-
and
-
twenty
we
go
on
and
on
,
see
nothing
<EOS>
but
now
and
then
a
lonely
house
,
or
a
villainous
-
look
shepherd
:
with
matted
hair
all
over
his
face
,
and
himself
wrap
to
the
chin
in
a
frowsy
brown
mantle
,
tend
his
sheep
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
that
distance
,
we
stop
to
refresh
the
horse
,
and
to
get
some
lunch
,
in
a
common
malaria
-
shake
,
despondent
little
public
-
house
,
whose
every
inch
of
wall
and
beam
,
inside
,
<EOS>
be
(
accord
to
custom
)
paint
and
decorate
in
a
way
so
miserable
that
every
room
look
like
the
wrong
side
of
another
room
,
and
,
with
its
wretched
imitation
of
drapery
,
and
lop
-
sided
little
daub
of
lyre
,
seem
to
have
be
plunder
from
behind
the
scene
of
some
travel
circus
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
be
fairly
go
off
again
,
we
begin
,
in
a
perfect
fever
,
to
strain
our
eye
for
Rome
;
and
when
,
after
another
mile
or
two
,
the
Eternal
City
appear
,
at
length
,
in
the
distance
;
it
look
like
---
<EOS>
I
be
half
afraid
to
write
the
word
---
like
LONDON
!
!
!
 
<EOS>
there
it
lie
,
under
a
thick
cloud
,
with
innumerable
tower
,
and
steeple
,
and
roof
of
house
,
rise
up
into
the
sky
,
and
high
above
them
all
,
<EOS>
one
Dome
.
 
<EOS>
I
swear
,
that
keenly
as
I
feel
the
seeming
absurdity
of
the
comparison
,
it
be
so
like
London
,
at
that
distance
,
that
if
you
could
have
show
it
me
,
in
a
glass
,
I
should
have
take
it
for
nothing
else

<EOS>
ROME
 
we
enter
the
Eternal
City
,
at
about
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
on
the
thirtieth
of
January
,
by
the
Porta
del
Popolo
,
and
come
immediately
---
it
be
a
dark
,
muddy
day
,
and
there
have
be
heavy
rain
---
on
the
skirt
of
the
Carnival
.
 
<EOS>
We
do
not
,
then
,
know
that
we
be
only
look
at
the
fag
end
of
the
mask
,
who
be
drive
slowly
round
and
round
the
Piazza
until
they
could
find
a
promising
opportunity
for
fall
into
the
stream
of
carriage
,
and
get
,
in
good
time
,
into
the
thick
of
the
festivity
;
and
come
among
them
so
abruptly
,
all
travel
-
stain
and
weary
,
be
not
come
very
well
prepared
to
enjoy
the
scene
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
cross
the
Tiber
by
the
Ponte
Molle
two
or
three
mile
before
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
look
as
yellow
as
it
ought
to
look
,
and
hurry
on
between
its
wear
-
away
and
miry
bank
,
have
a
promising
aspect
of
desolation
and
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
the
masquerade
dress
on
the
fringe
of
the
Carnival
,
do
great
violence
to
this
promise
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
great
ruin
,
no
solemn
token
of
antiquity
,
to
be
see
;
---
they
all
lie
on
the
other
side
of
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
there
seem
to
be
long
street
of
commonplace
shop
and
house
,
such
as
be
to
be
find
in
any
european
town
;
there
be
busy
people
,
equipage
,
ordinary
walker
to
and
fro
;
a
multitude
of
chatter
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
more
MY
Rome
:
 
the
Rome
of
anybody
's
fancy
,
man
or
boy
;
degraded
and
fallen
and
lie
asleep
in
the
sun
among
a
heap
of
ruin
:
 
than
the
Place
de
la
Concorde
in
Paris
be
.
 
<EOS>
a
cloudy
sky
,
a
dull
cold
rain
,
and
muddy
street
<EOS>
,
I
be
prepare
for
,
but
not
for
this
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
confess
to
have
go
to
bed
,
that
night
,
in
a
very
indifferent
humour
,
and
with
a
very
considerably
quench
enthusiasm
.
  
<EOS>
immediately
on
go
out
next
day
,
we
hurry
off
to
St
Peter
's
.
<EOS>
It
look
immense
in
the
distance
,
but
distinctly
and
decidedly
small
,
by
comparison
,
on
a
near
approach
.
 
<EOS>
the
beauty
of
the
Piazza
,
on
which
it
stand
,
with
its
cluster
of
exquisite
column
,
and
its
gushing
fountain
---
<EOS>
so
fresh
,
so
broad
,
and
free
,
and
beautiful
---
nothing
can
exaggerate
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
burst
of
the
interior
,
in
all
its
expansive
majesty
and
glory
:
 
and
,
most
of
all
<EOS>
,
the
look
up
into
the
Dome
:
 
be
a
sensation
never
to
be
forget
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
there
be
preparation
for
a
Festa
;
the
pillar
of
stately
marble
be
swathe
in
some
impertinent
frippery
of
red
and
yellow
;
<EOS>
the
altar
,
and
entrance
to
the
subterranean
chapel
:
which
be
before
it
:
 
in
the
centre
of
the
church
:
 
be
like
a
goldsmith
's
shop
,
or
one
of
the
opening
scene
in
a
very
lavish
pantomime
.
 
<EOS>
and
though
I
have
as
high
a
sense
of
the
beauty
of
the
building
(
I
hope
)
as
it
be
possible
to
entertain
,
I
feel
no
very
strong
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
infinitely
more
affected
in
many
english
cathedral
when
the
organ
have
be
play
,
and
in
many
english
country
church
when
the
congregation
have
be
singe
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
much
great
sense
of
mystery
and
wonder
,
in
the
Cathedral
of
San
Mark
at
Venice
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
come
out
of
the
church
again
(
we
stand
nearly
an
hour
stare
up
into
the
dome
:
 
and
would
not
have
"
go
over
"
the
Cathedral
then
,
for
any
money
)
<EOS>
,
we
say
to
the
coachman
,
"
go
to
the
Coliseum
.
"
 
<EOS>
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
,
he
stop
at
the
gate
,
and
we
go
in
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
no
fiction
,
but
plain
,
sober
,
honest
truth
,
to
say
:
 
<EOS>
so
suggestive
and
distinct
be
it
at
this
hour
:
 
that
,
for
a
moment
---
actually
in
pass
in
---
they
who
will
,
may
have
the
whole
great
pile
before
them
,
as
it
use
to
be
,
with
thousand
of
eager
face
stare
down
into
the
arena
,
and
such
a
whirl
of
strife
,
and
blood
,
and
dust
go
on
there
,
as
no
language
can
describe
.
 
<EOS>
Its
solitude
,
its
awful
beauty
,
and
its
utter
desolation
,
strike
upon
the
stranger
the
next
moment
,
like
a
softened
sorrow
;
and
never
in
his
life
,
perhaps
,
will
he
be
so
move
and
overcome
by
any
sight
,
not
immediately
connected
with
his
own
affection
and
affliction
.
  
<EOS>
to
see
it
crumble
there
,
an
inch
a
year
;
its
wall
and
arch
overgrow
with
green
;
its
corridor
open
to
the
day
;
the
long
grass
grow
in
its
porch
;
young
tree
of
yesterday
,
spring
up
on
its
ragged
parapet
,
and
bear
fruit
:
 
chance
produce
of
the
seed
drop
there
by
the
bird
who
build
their
nest
within
its
chink
and
cranny
;
to
see
its
Pit
of
Fight
fill
up
with
earth
,
and
the
peaceful
Cross
plant
in
the
centre
;
to
climb
into
its
upper
hall
,
and
look
down
on
ruin
,
ruin
,
ruin
,
all
about
it
;
the
triumphal
arch
of
Constantine
,
Septimus
Severus
,
and
Titus
;
the
Roman
Forum
;
the
Palace
of
the
Caesars
;
the
temple
of
the
old
religion
,
fall
down
and
go
;
be
to
see
the
ghost
of
old
Rome
,
wicked
,
wonderful
old
city
,
haunt
the
very
ground
on
which
its
people
tread
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
most
impressive
,
the
most
stately
,
the
most
solemn
,
grand
,
majestic
,
mournful
sight
,
conceivable
.
 
<EOS>
never
,
in
its
bloody
prime
,
can
the
sight
of
the
gigantic
Coliseum
,
full
and
run
over
with
the
lusty
life
,
have
move
one
's
heart
,
as
it
must
move
all
who
look
upon
it
now
,
a
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
GOD
be
thank
:
 
a
ruin
!
  
<EOS>
as
it
top
the
other
ruin
:
 
stand
there
,
a
mountain
among
grave
:
 
so
do
its
ancient
influence
outlive
all
other
remnant
of
the
old
mythology
and
old
butchery
of
Rome
,
in
the
nature
of
the
fierce
and
cruel
roman
people
.
 
<EOS>
the
italian
face
change
as
the
visitor
approach
the
city
;
its
beauty
become
devilish
;
and
there
be
scarcely
one
countenance
in
a
hundred
,
among
the
common
people
in
the
street
,
that
would
not
be
at
home
and
happy
in
a
renovate
Coliseum
to
-
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
here
be
Rome
indeed
at
last
;
and
such
a
Rome
as
no
one
can
imagine
in
its
full
and
awful
grandeur
!
 
<EOS>
We
wander
out
upon
the
Appian
Way
,
and
then
go
on
,
through
mile
of
ruin
tomb
and
break
wall
,
with
here
and
there
a
desolate
and
uninhabited
house
:
 
past
the
Circus
of
Romulus
,
where
the
course
of
the
chariot
,
the
station
of
the
judge
,
competitor
,
and
spectator
,
be
yet
as
plainly
to
be
see
as
in
old
time
:
 
past
the
tomb
of
Cecilia
Metella
:
 
past
all
inclosure
,
hedge
,
or
stake
,
wall
or
fence
:
 
away
upon
the
open
Campagna
,
where
on
that
side
of
Rome
,
nothing
be
to
be
behold
but
Ruin
.
 
<EOS>
except
where
the
distant
Apennines
bind
the
view
upon
the
left
,
the
whole
wide
prospect
be
one
field
of
ruin
.
<EOS>
broken
aqueduct
,
leave
in
the
most
picturesque
and
beautiful
cluster
of
arch
;
break
temple
;
break
tomb
.
 
<EOS>
a
desert
of
decay
,
sombre
and
desolate
beyond
all
expression
;
and
with
a
history
in
every
stone
that
strew
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
on
Sunday
,
the
Pope
assist
in
the
performance
of
High
Mass
at
St
Peter
's
.
 
<EOS>
the
effect
of
the
Cathedral
on
my
mind
,
on
that
second
visit
,
be
exactly
what
it
be
at
first
,
and
what
it
remain
after
many
visit
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
religiously
impressive
or
affect
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
immense
edifice
,
with
no
one
point
for
the
mind
to
rest
upon
;
and
it
tire
itself
with
wander
round
and
round
.
 
<EOS>
the
very
purpose
of
the
place
,
be
not
express
in
anything
you
see
there
,
unless
you
examine
its
detail
---
and
all
examination
of
detail
be
incompatible
with
the
place
itself
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
a
Pantheon
,
or
a
Senate
House
,
or
a
great
architectural
trophy
,
have
no
other
object
than
an
architectural
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
black
statue
of
St
Peter
,
to
be
sure
,
under
a
red
canopy
;
which
be
large
than
life
and
which
be
constantly
have
its
great
toe
kiss
by
good
Catholics
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
help
see
that
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
so
very
prominent
and
popular
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
do
not
heighten
the
effect
of
the
temple
,
as
a
work
of
art
;
and
it
be
not
expressive
---
to
me
at
least
---
of
its
high
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
a
large
space
behind
the
altar
,
be
fit
up
with
box
,
shape
like
those
at
the
Italian
Opera
in
England
,
but
in
their
decoration
much
more
gaudy
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
centre
of
the
kind
of
theatre
thus
rail
off
,
be
a
canopied
dai
with
the
Pope

chair
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
pavement
be
cover
with
a
carpet
of
the
bright
green
;
and
what
with
this
green
,
and
the
intolerable
red
and
crimson
,
and
gold
border
of
the
hanging
,
the
whole
concern
look
like
a
stupendous
Bonbon

<EOS>
on
either
side
of

be
a
large
box
for
lady
stranger

<EOS>
these

who
wear

quaint

halberd
like
those
which
be
usually
shoulder
by
those
theatrical
supernumerary

who
never

get
off
the
stage
fast
enough
,
and
who
may
be
generally
observe
to
linger
in
the
enemy

camp
after

I

in

(
like

and
sing
most
atrociously

<EOS>
all
about
the
green
carpet

there
be
a
slowly
move
crowd
of
people
:
talk
to
each
other
:
 
stare
at
the
Pope
through
eye
-
glass
;
defraud
one
another
,
in
moment
of
partial
curiosity
,
out
of
precarious
seat
on
the
basis
of
pillar
:
 
and
grin
hideously
at
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Dotted
here
and
there
,
be
little
knot
of
friar
(
Frances

cani
,
or
Cappuccini
,
in
their
coarse
brown
dress
and
peaked
hood
)
make
a
strange
contrast
to
the
gaudy
ecclesiastic
of
high
degree
,
and
have
their
humility
gratify
to
the
utmost
,
by
be
shoulder
about
,
and
elbow
right
and

on
all

<EOS>
some
of
these
have
muddy
sandal
and
umbrella

and
stain
garment
:
 
have
trudge
in
from
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
the
face
of
the
great
part
be
as
coarse
and
heavy
as
their
dress
;
their
dogged
,
stupid
,
monotonous
stare
at
all
the
glory
and
splendour
,
have
something
in
it
,
half
miserable
,
and
half
ridiculous

<EOS>
upon
the
green
carpet
itself
,
and
gather
round
the
altar
,
be
a
perfect
army
of
cardinal

priest
,
in
red

gold
,
purple
,
violet
,
white
,
and
fine
linen
.
 
<EOS>
straggler
from
these

go
to

among
the
crowd

converse
two
and

salutation

similarly
engage

<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
all
these
,
and
stealthy
Jesuits
creep
in
and
out
,
and
the
extreme
restlessness
of
the
Youth
of
England
,
who
be
perpetually
wander
about
,
some
few
steady
person
in
black
cassock
,
who
have
kneel
down
with
their
face
to
the
wall
,
and
be
pore
over
their
missal
,
become
,
unintentionally
,
a
sort
of
humane
man
-
trap
,
and
with
their
own
devout
leg
,
trip
up
other
people
's
by
the
dozen

<EOS>
there
be
a
great
pile
of
candle
lie
down
on
the
floor
near
me
,
which
a
very
old
man
in
a
rusty
black
gown
with
an
open
-
work
tippet
,
like
a
summer
ornament
for
a
fireplace
in
tissue

paper
,
make
himself
very
busy
in
dispense
to
all
the
ecclesiastic
:
 
<EOS>
one
a
-
piece
.
 
<EOS>
They
loiter
about
with
these
for
some
time
,
under
their
arm
like
walking
-
stick
,
or
in
their
hand
like
truncheon
.
 
<EOS>
at
a
certain
period
of
the
ceremony
,
however
,
each
carry
his
candle
up
to
the
Pope
,
lay
it
across
his
two
knee
to
be
bless
,
take
it
back
again
,
and
file
off
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
do
in
a
very
attenuated
procession
,
as
you
may
suppose
,
and
occupy
a
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
not
because
it
take
long
to
bless
a
candle
through
and
through
,
but
because
there
be
so
many
candle
to
be
bless
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
they
be
all
bless
:
 
<EOS>
and
then
they
be
all
light
;
and
then
the
Pope
be
take
up
,
chair
and
all
,
and
carry
round
the
church
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
say
,
that
I
never
see
anything
,
out
of
November
,
so
like
the
popular
english
commemoration
of
the
fifth
of
that
month
.
 
<EOS>
a
bundle
of
match
and
a
lantern
,
would
have
make
it
perfect
.
 
<EOS>
nor
do
the
Pope
,
himself
,
at
all
mar
the
resemblance
,
though
he
have
a
pleasant
and
venerable
face
;
for
,
as
this
part
of
the
ceremony
make
him
giddy
and
sick
,
he
shut
his
eye
when
it
be
perform
:
 
and
have
his
eye
shut
and
a
great
mitre
on
his
head
,
and
his
head
itself
wag
to
and
fro
as
they
shake
him
in
carry
,
he
look
as
if
his
mask
be
go
to
tumble
off
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
immense
fan
which
be
always
bear
,
one
on
either
side
of
him
,
accompany
him
,
of
course
,
on
this
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
carry
him
along
,
he
bless
the
people
with
the
mystic
sign
;
and
as
he
pass
them
,
they
kneel
down
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
make
the
round
of
the
church
,
he
be
bring
back
again
,
and
if
I
be
not
mistaken
,
this
performance
be
repeat
,
in
the
whole
,
three
time
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
,
certainly
nothing
solemn
or
effective
in
it
;
and
certainly
very
much
that
be
droll
and
tawdry
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
remark
apply
to
the
whole
ceremony
,
except
the
raising
of
the
Host
,
when
every
man
in
the
guard
drop
on
one
knee
instantly
,
and
dash
his
naked
sword
on
the
ground
;
which
have
a
fine
effect
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
time
I
see
the
cathedral
,
be
some
two
or
three
week
afterwards
,
when
I
climb
up
into
the
ball
;
and
then
,
the
hanging
be
take
down
,
and
the
carpet
take
up
,
but
all
the
framework
leave
<EOS>
,
the
remnant
of
these
decoration
look
like
an
exploded
cracker
.
  
<EOS>
the
Friday
and
Saturday
have
be
solemn
Festa
day
,
and
Sunday
be
always
a
dies
NON
in
carnival
proceeding
,
we
have
look
forward
,
with
some
impatience
and
curiosity
,
to
the
beginning
of
the
new
week
:
 
Monday
and
Tuesday
be
the
two
last
and
good
day
of
the
Carnival
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
Monday
afternoon
at
one
or
two
o'clock
,
there
begin
to
be
a
great
rattling
of
carriage
into
the
court
-
yard
of
the
hotel
;
a
hurrying
to
and
fro
of
all
the
servant
in
it
;
and
,
now
and
then
,
a
swift
shoot
across
some
doorway
or
balcony
,
of
a
straggle
stranger
in
a
fancy
dress
:
 
not
yet
sufficiently
well
used
to
the
same
,
to
wear
it
with
confidence
,
and
defy
public
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
carriage
be
open
,
and
have
the
lining
carefully
cover
with
white
cotton
or
calico
,
to
prevent
their
proper
decoration
from
be
spoil
by
the
incessant
pelting
of
sugar
-
plum
;
and
people
be
pack
and
cram
into
every
vehicle
as
it
wait
for
its
occupant
,
enormous
sack
and
basket
full
of
these
confetti
,
together
with
such
heap
of
flower
,
tie
up
in
little
nosegay
,
that
some
carriage
be
not
only
brimful
of
flower
,
but
literally
run
over
:
 
scattering
,
at
every
shake
and
jerk
of
the
spring
,
some
of
their
abundance
on
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
not
to
be
behindhand
in
these
essential
particular
,
we
cause
two
very
respectable
sack
of
sugar
-
plum
(
each
about
three
foot
high
)
and
a
large
clothe
-
basket
full
of
flower
to
be
convey
into
our
hire
barouche

with
all
speed

from
our
place
of
observation
,
in
one
of
the
upper
balcony
of
the
hotel
,
we
contemplate
these
arrangement
with
the
lively
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
the
carriage
now
begin
to
take
up
their
company
,
and
move
away
,
we
get
into
ours
,
and
drive
off
too
,
armed
with
little
wire
mask
for
our
face
;
the
sugar
-
plum
,
like
Falstaff
's
adulterated
sack
,
have
lime
in
their
composition
.
  
<EOS>
the
Corso
be
a
street
a
mile
long
;
a
street
of
shop
,
and
palace
,
and
private
house
,
sometimes
open
into
a
broad
piazza
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
verandah
and
balcony
,
of
all
shape
and
size
,
to
almost
every
house
---
not
on
one
story
alone
,
but
often
to
one
room
or
another
on
every
story
---
put
there
in
general
with
so
little
order
or
regularity
,
that
if
,
year

year
,
and
season
after

it

rain
balcony

hail
balcony

snow
balcony

blow
balcony
,
they
could
scarcely
have
come
into
existence
in
a
more
disorderly
manner
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
great
fountain
-
head
and
focus
of
the
Carnival
.
 
<EOS>
but
all
the
street
in
which
the
Carnival
be
hold
,
be
vigilantly
keep
by
dragoon
,
it
be
necessary
for
carriage
,
in
the
first
instance
,
to
pass
,
in
line
,
down
another
thoroughfare
,
and
so
come
into
the
Corso
at
the
end
remote
from
the
Piazza
del
Popolo
;
which
be
one
of
its
termination
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
we
fall
into
the
string
of
coach
,
and
,
for
some
time
,
jog
on
quietly
enough
;
now
crawl
on
at
a
very
slow
walk
;
now
trot
half
-
a
-
dozen
yard
;
now
back
fifty
;
and
now
stop
altogether
:
 
as
the
pressure
in
front
oblige
us
.
<EOS>
if
any
impetuous
carriage
dash
out
of
the
rank
and
clatter
forward
,
with
the
wild
idea
of
get
on
faster
,
it
be
suddenly
meet
,
or
overtaken
,
by
a
trooper
on
horseback
,
who
,
deaf
as
his
own
draw
sword
to
all
remonstrance
,
immediately
escort
it
back
to
the
very
end
of
the
row
,
and
make
it
a
dim
speck
in
the
remote
perspective
.
 
<EOS>
occasionally
,
we
interchange
a
volley
of
confetti
with
the
carriage
next
in
front
,
or
the
carriage
next
behind
;
but
as
yet
,
this
capturing
of
stray
and
errant
coach
by
the
military
,
be
the
chief
amusement
.
  
<EOS>
presently
,
we
come
into
a
narrow
street
,
where
,
besides
one
line
of
carriage
go
,
there
be
another
line
of
carriage
return
.
<EOS>
here
the
sugar
-
plum
and
the
nosegay
begin
to
fly
about
,
pretty
smartly
;
and
I
be
fortunate
enough
to
observe
one
gentleman
attire
as
a
greek
warrior
,
catch
a
light
-
whisker
brigand
on
the
nose
<EOS>
(
he
be
in
the
very
act
of
toss
up
a
bouquet
to
a
young
lady
in
a
first

floor
window
)
with
a
precision
that
be
much
applaud
by
the
bystander
.
 
<EOS>
as
this
victorious
Greek
be
exchange
a
facetious
remark
with
a
stout
gentleman
in
a
doorway
---
<EOS>
one

half
black
and
one
-
half
white
,
<EOS>
as

he

up

offer
him
his
congratulation
on
this
achievement

he
receive
an
orange

a

full

much
surprised

not

discomfited

<EOS>
especially

as
he
be
stand
up
at
the
time
;
and
in
consequence
of
the
carriage
move
on
suddenly
,
at
the
same
moment
,
stagger
ignominiously
,
and
bury
himself
among
his
flower
.
  
<EOS>
some
quarter
of
an
hour
of
this
sort
of
progress

bring
us
to
the
Corso

and
anything
so
gay

odd

it

any
general
mingling

there
seem

prevail

a

almost

ourselves
of
a

quiet
interval

Week

have

yet
begin

by
dint

go
out
early
every

come
back
late
every

hard
all
day

I
believe
we
make
acquaintance
with
every
post
and
pillar
in
the
city

and
the
country
round
;
and
,
in
particular

explore
so
many

I
abandon

go

I

almost

among

It

the
great
flight
of

that
lead
from
the
Piazza

to
the

the

I
could
not

why
they
appear
to
have
beset
me
,
for
year
,
in
every
possible
variety
of
action

costume
;
and
how
it
come
to
pass
that
they
start
up
before
me
,
in
Rome
,
in
the
broad
day
,
like
so
many
saddled

bridled
nightmare

I
soon
find
that
we
have
make
acquaintance
,

improve
it

for
several

on

various
Exhibition

<EOS>
there
be
one
old
gentleman
,
with
long
white
hair

an
immense
beard

who
,
to
my

have
go
half
through
the
catalogue
of
the
Royal
Academy

<EOS>
this
be
the
venerable

patriarchal
model

He
carry
a
long
staff

and
every
knot
and
twist
in
that
staff
I
have
see
,
faithfully
delineate
,
innumerable
time

<EOS>
there
be
another
man
in

who
always
pretend
to
be
asleep
in
the
sun

when
there
be
any

and
who
,
I
need
not

be
always
very
wide
awake

very
attentive

the
disposition
of
his

this

there

who
lean
against

with
his

fold
in
his
mantle

and
look
out

the
corner
of
his

be
just
visible

as
to
Domestic
Happiness

they
should
come
very
cheap

for
there
be
lump
of

,
all
up
the

and
the
cream
of
the
thing
be
,
that
they
be
all
the
false
vagabond
in

especially
make
up

have
no

My
recent
mention
of
the
Carnival
,
remind
me
of
its
being
say
to
be
a
mock
mourning
(
in
the
ceremony
with
which
it
close
)
,
for
the
gaiety
and
merry
-
making
before
Lent
;
and
this
again
remind
me
of
the
real
funeral
and
mourn
procession
of
Rome
,
which
,
like
those
in
most
other
part
of
Italy
,
be
render
chiefly
remarkable
to
a
Foreigner
,
by
the
indifference
with
which
the
mere
clay
be
universally
regard
,
after
life
have
leave
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
be
not
from
the
survivor
have
have
time
to
dissociate
the
memory
of
the
dead
from
their
well

remember
appearance
and
form
on
earth
;
for
the
interment
follow
too
speedily
after
death
,
for
that
:
 
almost
always
take
place
within
four

twenty
hour

,
sometimes

within

<EOS>
at

visit

so
slightly
make

,
which
seem
incomplete
without
some
group
of
bearded
soothsayer
on
the
top
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
remarkable
for
the
possession
of
a
miraculous
Bambino
,
or
wooden
doll
,
represent
the
Infant
Saviour
;
and
I
first
see
this
miraculous
Bambino
,
in
legal
phrase
,
in
manner
follow
,
that
be
to
say
:
  
We
have
stroll
into
the
church
one
afternoon
,
and
be
look
down
its
long
vista
of
gloomy
pillar
(
for
all
these
ancient
church
build
upon
the
ruin
of
old
temple
,
be
dark
and
sad
)
,
when
the
Brave
come
run
in
,
with
a
grin
upon
his
face
that
stretch
it
from
ear
to
ear
,
and
implore
us
to
follow
him
,
without
a
moment
's
delay
,
as
they
be
go
to
show
the
Bambino
to
a
select
party
.
 
<EOS>
We
accordingly
hurry
off
to
a
sort
of
chapel
,
or
sacristy
,
hard
by
the
chief
altar
,
but
not
in
the
church
itself
,
where
the
select
party
,
consist
of
two
or
three
catholic
gentleman
and
lady
(
not
Italians
)
,
be
already
assemble
:
 
and
where
one
hollow
-
cheek
young
monk
be
light
up
diver
candle
,
while
another
be
put
on
some
clerical
robe
over
his
coarse
brown
habit
.
 
<EOS>
the
candle
be
on
a
kind
of
altar
,
and
above
it
be
two
delectable
figure
,
such
as
you
would
see
at
any
english
fair
,
represent
the
Holy
Virgin
,
and
Saint
Joseph
,
as
I
suppose
,
bend
in
devotion
over
a
wooden
box
,
or
coffer
;
which
be
shut
.
  
<EOS>
the
hollow
-
cheek
monk
,
number
one
,
have
finish
light
the
candle
,
go
down
on
his
knee
,
in
a
corner
,
before
this
set
-
piece
;
and
the
monk
number
two
,
have
put
on
a
pair
of
highly
ornamented
and
gold
-
bespatter
glove
,
lift
down
the
coffer
,
with
great
reverence
,
and
set
it
on
the
altar
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
with
many
genuflexion
,
and
mutter
certain
prayer
,
he
open
it
,
and
let
down
the
front
,
and
take
off
sundry
covering
of
satin
and
lace
from
the
inside
.
 
<EOS>
the
lady
have
be
on
their
knee
from
the
commencement
;
and
the
gentleman
now
drop
down
devoutly
,
as
he
expose
to
view
a
little
wooden
doll
,
in
face
very
like
General
Tom
Thumb
,
the
American
Dwarf
:
 
gorgeously
dress
in
satin
and
gold
lace
,
and
actually
blaze
with
rich
jewel
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
scarcely
a
spot
upon
its
little
breast
,
or
neck
,
or
stomach
,
but
be
sparkle
with
the
costly
offering
of
the
Faithful
.
 
<EOS>
presently
,
he
lift
it
out
of
the
box
,
and
carry
it
round
among
the
kneeler
,
set
its
face
against
the
forehead
of
every
one
,
and
tender
its
clumsy
foot
to
them
to
kiss
---
a
ceremony
which
they
all
perform
down
to
a
dirty
little
ragamuffin
of
a
boy
who
have
walk
in
from
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
when
this
be
do
,
he
lay
it
in
the
box
again
:
 
and
the
company
,
rise
,
draw
near
,
and
commend
the
jewel
in
whisper
.
<EOS>
in
good
time
,
he
replace
the
covering
,
shut
up
the
box
,
put
it
back
in
its
place
,
lock
up
the
whole
concern
(
Holy
Family
and
all
)
behind
a
pair
of
fold
-
door
;
take
off
his
priestly
vestment
;
and
receive
the
customary
"
small
charge
,
"
while
his
companion
,
by
mean
of
an
extinguisher
fasten
to
the
end
of
a
long
stick
,
put
out
the
light
,
one
after
another
.
 
<EOS>
the
candle
be
all
extinguish
,
and
the
money
all
collect
,
they
retire
,
and
so
do
the
spectator
.
  
<EOS>
I
meet
this
same
Bambino
,
in
the
street
a
short
time
afterwards
,
go
,
in
great
state
,
to
the
house
of
some
sick
person
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
take
to
all
part
of
Rome
for
this
purpose
,
constantly
;
but
,
I
understand
that
it
be
not
always
as
successful
as
could
be
wish
;
for
,
make
its
appearance
at
the
bedside
of
weak
and
nervous
people
in
extremity
,
accompany
by
a
numerous
escort
,
it
not
unfrequently
frighten
them
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
most
popular
in
case
of
child
-
birth
,
where
it
have
do
such
wonder
,
that
if
a
lady
be
long
than
usual
in
get
through
her
difficulty
,
a
messenger
be
despatch
,
with
all
speed
,
to
solicit
the
immediate
attendance
of
the
Bambino
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
valuable
property
,
and
much
confide
in
---
especially
by
the
religious
body
to
whom
it
belong
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
happy
to
know
that
it
be
not
consider
immaculate
,
by
some
who
be
good
Catholics
,
and
who
be
behind
the
scene
,
from
what
be
tell
me
by
the
near
relation
of
a
Priest
,
himself
a
Catholic
,
and
a
gentleman
of
learning
and
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
this
Priest
make
my
informant
promise
that
he
would
,
on
no
account
,
allow
the
Bambino
to
be
bear
into
the
bedroom
of
a
sick
lady
,
in
whom
they
be
both
interested
.
 
<EOS>
"
for
,
"
say
he
,
"
if
they
(
the
monk
)
trouble
her
with
it
,
and
intrude
themselves
into
her
room
,
it
will
certainly
kill
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
My
informant
accordingly
look
out
of
the
window
when
it
come
;
and
,
with
many
thank
,
decline
to
open
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
endeavour
,
in
another
case
of
which
he
have
no
other
knowledge
than
such
as
he
gain
as
a
passer
-
by
at
the
moment
,
to
prevent
its
be
carry
into
a
small
unwholesome
chamber
,
where
a
poor
girl
be
die
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
he
strove
against
it
unsuccessfully
,
and
she
expire
while
the
crowd
be
press
round
her
bed
.
  
<EOS>
among
the
people
who
drop
into
St
Peter
's
at
their
leisure
,
to
kneel
on
the
pavement
,
and
say
a
quiet
prayer
,
there
be
certain
school
and
seminary
,
priestly
and
otherwise
,
that
come
in
,
twenty
or
thirty
strong
.
 
<EOS>
these
boy
always
kneel
down
in
single
file
,
one
behind
the
other
,
with
a
tall
grim
master
in
a
black
gown
,
bring
up
the
rear
:
 
like
a
pack
of
card
arrange
to
be
tumble
down
at
a
touch
,
with
a
disproportionately
large
Knave
of
club
at
the
end
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
have
have
a
minute
or
so
at
the
chief
altar
,
they
scramble
up
,
and
file
off
to
the
chapel
of
the
Madonna
,
or
the
sacrament
,
flop
down
again
in
the
same
order
;
so
that
if
anybody
do
stumble
against
the
master
,
a
general
and
sudden
overthrow
of
the
whole
line
must
inevitably
ensue
.
  
<EOS>
the
scene
in
all
the
church
be
the
strange
possible
.
 
<EOS>
the
same
monotonous
,
heartless
,
drowsy
chaunting
,
always
go
on
;
the
same
dark
building
,
dark
from
the
brightness
of
the
street
without
;
the
same
lamp
dimly
burn
;
the
self
-
same
people
kneel
here
and
there
;
turn
towards
you
,
from
one
altar
or
other
,
the
same
priest
's
back
,
with
the
same
large
cross
embroider
on
it
;
however
different
in
size
,
in
shape
,
in
wealth
,
in
architecture
,
this
church
be
from
that
,
it
be
the
same
thing
still
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
same
dirty
beggar
stop
in
their
muttered
prayer
to
beg
;
the
same
miserable
cripple
exhibit
their
deformity
at
the
door
;
the
same
blind
man
,
rattle
little
pot
like
kitchen
pepper
-
castor
:
their
depository
for
alm
;
the
same
preposterous
crown
of
silver
stick
upon
the
paint
head
of
single
saint
and
virgin
in
crowded
picture
,
so
that
a
little
figure
on
a
mountain
have
a
head
-
dress
big
than
the
temple
in
the
foreground
,
or
adjacent
mile
of
landscape
;
the
same
favourite
shrine
or
figure
,
smother
with
little
silver
heart
and
crosse
,
and
the
like
:
 
the
staple
trade
and
show
of
all
the
jeweller
;
the
same
odd
mixture
of
respect
and
indecorum
,
faith
and
phlegm
:
 
kneel
on
the
stone
,
and
spit
on
them
,
loudly
;
get
up
from
prayer
to
beg
a
little
,
or
to
pursue
some
other
worldly
matter
:
 
and
then
kneel
down
again
,
to
resume
the
contrite
supplication
at
the
point
where
it
be
interrupt
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
church
,
a
kneel
lady
get
up
from
her
prayer
,
for
a
moment
,
to
offer
us
her
card
,
as
a
teacher
of
music
;
and
in
another
,
a
sedate
gentleman
with
a
very
thick
walking
-
staff
,
arise
from
his
devotion
to
belabour
his
dog
,
who
be
growl
at
another
dog
:
 
and
whose
yelps
and
howl
resound
through
the
church
,
as
his
master
quietly
relapse
into
his
former
train
of
meditation
---
keep
his
eye
upon
the
dog
,
at
the
same
time
,
nevertheless
.
  
<EOS>
above
all
,
there
be
always
a
receptacle
for
the
contribution
of
the
faithful
,
in
some
form
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
it
be
a
money
-
box
,
set
up
between
the
worshipper
,
and
the
wooden
life
-
size
figure
of
the
Redeemer
;
sometimes
,
it
be
a
little
chest
for
the
maintenance
of
the
Virgin
;
sometimes
,
an
appeal
on
behalf
of
a
popular
Bambino
;
sometimes
,
a
bag
at
the
end
of
a
long
stick
,
thrust
among
the
people
here
and
there
,
and
vigilantly
jingle
by
an
active
Sacristan
;
but
there
it
always
be
,
and
,
very
often
,
in
many
shape
in
the
same
church
,
and
do
pretty
well
in
all
.
 
<EOS>
nor
,
be
it
want
in
the
open
air
---
the
street
and
road
---
for
,
often
as
you
be
walk
along
,
think
about
anything
rather
than
a
tin
canister
,
<EOS>
that
object
pounce
out
upon
you
from
a
little
house
by
the
wayside
;
and
on
its
top
be
paint
,
"
<EOS>
for
the
Souls
in
Purgatory
;
"
an
appeal
which
the
bearer
repeat
a
great
many
time
,
as
he
rattle
it
before
you
,
much
as
Punch
rattle
the
crack
bell
which
his
sanguine
disposition
make
an
organ
of
.
  
<EOS>
and
this
remind
me
that
some
roman
altar
of
peculiar
sanctity
,
bear
the
inscription
,
"
every
Mass
perform
at
this
altar
free
a
soul
from
Purgatory
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
be
able
to
find
out
the
charge
for
one
of
these
service
,
but
they
should
needs
be
expensive
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
several
crosse
in
Rome
too
,
the
kissing
of
which
,
confer
indulgence
for
vary
term
.
 
<EOS>
that
in
the
centre
of
the
Coliseum
,
be
worth
a
hundred
day
;
and
people
may
be
see
kiss
it
from
morning
to
night
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
curious
that
some
of
these
crosse
seem
to
acquire
an
arbitrary
popularity
:
 
this
very
one
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
in
another
part
of
the
Coliseum
there
be
a
cross
upon
a
marble
slab
,
with
the
inscription
,
"
<EOS>
who
kiss
this
cross
shall
be
entitle
to
two
hundred
and
forty
day
'
indulgence
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
I
see
no
one
person
kiss
it
,
though
,
day
after
day
,
I
sit
in
the
arena
,
and
see
score
upon
score
of
peasant
pass
it
,
on
their
way
to
kiss
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
to
single
out
detail
from
the
great
dream
of
roman
Churches
,
would
be
the
wild
occupation
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
but
St
Stefano
Rotondo
,
a
damp
,
mildewed
vault
of
an
old
church
in
the
outskirt
of
Rome
,
will
always
struggle
uppermost
in
my
mind
,
by
reason
of
the
hideous
painting
with
which
its
wall
be
cover
.
 
<EOS>
these
represent
the
martyrdom
of
saint
and
early
Christians
;
and
such
a
panorama
of
horror
and
butchery
<EOS>
no
man
could
imagine
in
his
sleep
,
though
he
be
to
eat
a
whole
pig
raw
,
for
supper
.

Grey

screw
off

broken

up

<EOS>
these
be
among
the
mild

<EOS>
so
insist
on
,
and
labour
at
,
besides

that
every
sufferer
give
you
the
same
occasion
for
wonder
as
poor
old
Duncan
awoke
,
in
Lady
Macbeth
,
when
she
marvel
at
his
have
so
much
blood
in
him

<EOS>
there
be
an
upper
chamber
in
the
Mamertine
prison
,
over
what
be
say
to
have
be
---
and
very
possibly
may
have
be
---
the
dungeon
of
St
Peter
.
 
<EOS>
this
chamber
be
now
fit
up
as
an
oratory
,
dedicated
to
that
saint
;
and
it
live
,
as
a
distinct
and
separate
place
,
in
my
recollection
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
small
and
low
-
roofed
;
and
the
dread
and
gloom
of
the
ponderous
,
obdurate
old
prison
be
on
it
,
as
if
they
have
come
up
in
a
dark
mist
through
the
floor
.
<EOS>
hang
on
the
wall
,
among
the
clustered
votive
offering
,
be
object
,
at
once
strangely
in
keep
,
and
strangely
at
variance
,
with
the
place
---
rusty
dagger
,
knife
,
pistol
,
club
,
diver
instrument
of
violence
and
murder
,
bring
here
,
fresh
from
use
,
and
hang
up
to
propitiate
offend
Heaven
:
 
as
if
the
blood
upon
them
would
drain
off
in
consecrate
air
,
and
have
no
voice
to
cry
with
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
all
so
silent
and
so
close
,
and
tomb
-
like
;
and
the
dungeon
below
be
so
black
and
stealthy
,
and
stagnant
,
and
naked
;
that
this
little
dark
spot
become
a
dream
within
a
dream
:
 
and
in
the
vision
of
great
church
which
come
roll
past
me
like
a
sea
,
it
be
a
small
wave
by
itself
,
that
melt
into
no
other
wave
,
and
do
not
flow
on
with
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
an
awful
thing
to
think
of
the
enormous
cavern
that
be
enter
from
some
roman
church
,
and
undermine
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
many
church
have
crypt
and
subterranean
chapel
of
great
size
,
which
,
in
the
ancient

,
be
bath
,
and
secret
chamber
of
temple
,
and
what
not
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
speak
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
beneath
the
church
of
St
Giovanni

St
Paolo

there
be
the
jaw
of

they

an
agony
surpass
any
that
this
Dust
have
suffer
with

breath
of
life
yet
linger
in
it

and
how
these
great

constant
heart
would
have
be
shake

how

have
quail

droop

if
a
foreknowledge

the
deed
that
profess

would
commit
in
the
Great

could
have
rent
them
with
its

on

cruel

bitter
cross

<EOS>
such
be
the

that
remain
apart

<EOS>
I
have
a
fainter
recollection

sometimes
of

of
the
fragment

of

be
rend

;
of

portion

of

well
at
which
the

and
the

these

a
shadowy

stop
them

<EOS>
the
rest
be
a
vast
wilderness

one

battered
pillar
of

Pagan

dig
up

with

stick
full

their

fiercely

then
my

on

<EOS>
nine

ten
month

he

waylay
a

travel
as
a

alone

on
foot
,
of
course
---
and
perform
<EOS>
,
it
be
say
,
that
act
of
piety
for
the
fourth
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
her
change
a
piece
of
gold
at
Viterbo
,
where
he
live
;
follow
her
;
bore
her
company
on
her
journey
for
some
forty
mile
or
more
,
on
the
treacherous
pretext
of
protect
her
;
attack
her
,
in
the
fulfilment
of
his
unrelenting
purpose
,
on
the
Campagna
,
within
a
very
short
distance
of
Rome
,
near
to
what
be
call
(
but
what
be
not
)
<EOS>
the
Tomb
of
Nero
;
rob
her
;
and
beat
her
to
death
with
her
own
pilgrim
's
staff
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
newly
married
,
and
give
some
of
her
apparel
to
his
wife
:
 
say
that
he
have
buy
it
at
a
fair
.
 
<EOS>
She
,
however
,
who
have
see
the
pilgrim

countess
passing
through
their
town

recognise
some
trifle
as
have
belong

her

<EOS>
Her
husband
then
tell
her
what
he
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
She
,
in
confession
,
tell
a
priest
;
and
the
man
be
take
,
within
four
day
after
the
commission
of
the
murder
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
fix
time
for
the
administration
of
justice
,
or
its
execution
,
in
this
unaccountable
country
;
and
he
have
be
in
prison
ever
since
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
Friday
,
as
he
be
dine
with
the
other
prisoner
,
they
come
and
tell
him
he
be
to
be
behead
next
morning
,
and
take
him
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
unusual
to
execute
in
Lent
;
but
his
crime
be
a
very
bad
one
,
it
be
deem
advisable
to
make
an
example
of
him
at
that
time
,
when
great
number
of
pilgrim
be
come
towards
Rome
,
from
all

Holy

I

call
on
the

They

after

some

and
above
their

the

this

It

when
he
appear
on
the

bare

;
his

and
with

He
have
refuse

it

without
first
have
his
wife
bring
to
see
him
;
and
they
have
send
an

which
have
occasion
the

He

kneel
down

<EOS>
His

<EOS>
immediately

<EOS>
the
executioner
be
hold
it
by
the
hair

and
walk
with
it
round
the
scaffold
,
show
it
to
the
people
,
before
one
quite
know
that
the
knife
have
fall
heavily
,
and
with
a
rattle
sound
.
  
<EOS>
when
it
have
travel
round
the
four
side

it

set
upon
a
pole

a
little
patch
of
black

white

for
the
long
street
to
stare
at

and
the
fly

settle
on

<EOS>
the
eye
be
turn
upward
,
as
if
he
have
avoid
the
sight
of
the
leathern
bag

and
look

the
crucifix

<EOS>
every
tinge

hue
of
life

leave
it
in
that
instant

<EOS>
It
be
dull

cold
,
livid
,
wax

<EOS>
the
body
also
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
deal
of
blood
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
leave
the
window
,
and
go
close
up
to
the
scaffold
,
it

very
dirty
;
one

the
two

throw
water
over
it
,
turn
to
help
the
other
lift
the
body
into
a
shell
,
pick
his
way
as
through
mire

<EOS>
a
strange
appearance
be
the
apparent
annihilation
of
the
neck
.
 
<EOS>
the
head
be
take
off
so
close
,
that
it
seem
as
if
the
knife
have
narrowly
escape
crush
the
jaw
,
or
shave
off
the
ear
;
and
the
body
look

nobody

all

<EOS>
there
be
no
manifestation

<EOS>
My
empty
pocket
be
try

several
time

in
the
crowd
immediately
below
the
scaffold
,
as
the
corpse
be
be
put
into
its
coffin
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
ugly
,
filthy
,
careless
,
sickening
spectacle
;
mean
nothing
but
butchery
beyond
the
momentary
interest
,
to
the
one
wretched
actor

<EOS>
yes
!
 
<EOS>
such
a
sight
have
one
meaning
and
one
warning
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
not
forget
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
speculator
in
the
lottery

station
themselves
at
favourable
point
for
count
the
gout
of
blood
that
spirt
out
,
here
or
there
;
and
buy
that
number
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
pretty
sure
to
have
a
run
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
body
be
cart
away
in
due
time
,
the
knife
cleanse
,
the
scaffold
take
down
,
and
all
the
hideous
apparatus
remove
.
 
<EOS>
the
executioner
:
 
an
outlaw
EX
OFFICIO
(
what
a
satire
on
the
punishment
!
)
<EOS>
who
dare
not
,
for
his
life
,
cross
the
Bridge
of
St

but
to
do
his
work
:
 
retreat
to
his
lair
,
and
the
show
be
over
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
head
of
the
collection
in
the
palace
of
Rome
,
the
Vatican
,
of
course
,
with
its
treasure
of
art
,
its
enormous
gallery
,
and
staircase
,
and
suite
upon
suite
of
immense
chamber
,
rank
high
and
stand
foremost
.
 
<EOS>
many
most
noble
statue
,
and
wonderful
picture
,
be
there
;
nor
be
it
heresy
to
say
that
there
be
a
considerable
amount
of
rubbish
there
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
when
any
old
piece
of
sculpture
dig
out
of
the
ground
,
find
a
place
in
a
gallery
because
it
be
old
,
and
without
any
reference
to
its
intrinsic
merit
:
 
and
find
admirer
by
the
hundred
,
because
it
be
there
,
and
for
no
other
reason
on
earth
:
 
there
will
be
no
lack
of
object
,
very
indifferent
in
the
plain
eyesight
of
any
one
who
employ
so
vulgar
a
property
,
when
he
may
wear
the
spectacle
of
can
not
for
less
than
nothing
,
and
establish
himself
as
a
man
of
taste
for
the
mere
trouble
of
put
them
on
.
  
<EOS>
I
unreservedly
confess
,
for
myself
,
that
I
can
not
leave
my
natural
perception
of
what
be
natural
and
true
,
at
a
palace
-
door
,
in
Italy
or
elsewhere
,
as
I
should
leave
my
shoe
if
I
be
travel
in
the
East
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
forget
that
there
be
certain
expression
of
face
,
natural
to
certain
passion
,
and
as
unchangeable
in
their
nature
as
the
gait
of
a
lion
,
or
the
flight
of
an
eagle
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
dismiss
from
my
certain
knowledge
,
such
commonplace
fact
as
the
ordinary
proportion
of
man
's
arm
,
and
leg
,
and
head
;
and
when
I
meet
with
performance
that
do
violence
to
these
experience
and
recollection
,
no
matter
where
they
may
be
,
I
can
not
honestly
admire
them
,
and
think
it
best
to
say
so
;
in
spite
of
high
critical
advice
that
we
should
sometimes
feign
an
admiration
,
though
we
have
it
not
.
  
<EOS>
therefore
,
I
freely
acknowledge
that
when
I
see
a
jolly
young
Waterman
represent
a
cherubim
,
or
a
Barclay
and
Perkins
's
Drayman
depict
as
an
Evangelist
,
I
see
nothing
to
commend
or
admire
in
the
performance
,
however
great
its
reputed
painter
.
<EOS>
neither
be
I
partial
to
libellous
Angels
,
who
play
on
fiddle
and
bassoon
,
for
the
edification
of
sprawl
monk
apparently
in
liquor
.
 
<EOS>
nor
to
those
Monsieur
Tonsons
of
gallery
,
Saint
Francis
and
Saint
Sebastian
;
both
of
whom
I
submit
should
have
very
uncommon
and
rare
merit
,
as
work
of
art
,
to
justify
their
compound
multiplication
by
italian
Painters
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
,
too
,
that
the
indiscriminate
and
determined
rapture
in
which
some
critic
indulge
,
be
incompatible
with
the
true
appreciation
of
the
really
great
and
transcendent
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
imagine
,
for
example
,
how
the
resolute
champion
of
undeserving
picture
can
soar
to
the
amazing
beauty
of
Titian
's
great
picture
of
the
Assumption
of
the
Virgin
at
Venice
;
or
how
the
man
who
be
truly
affect
by
the
sublimity
of
that
exquisite
production
,
or
who
be
truly
sensible
of
the
beauty
of
Tintoretto
's
great
picture
of
the
Assembly
of
the
bless
in
the
same
place
,
can
discern
in
Michael
Angelo
's
last
judgment
,
in
the
Sistine
chapel
,
any
general
idea
,
or
one
pervade
thought
,
in
harmony
with
the
stupendous
subject
.
 
<EOS>
He
who
will
contemplate
Raphael
's
masterpiece
,
the
transfiguration
,
and
will
go
away
into
another
chamber
of
that
same
Vatican
,
and
contemplate
another
design
of
Raphael
,
represent
(
in
incredible
caricature
)
<EOS>
the
miraculous
stopping
of
a
great
fire
by
Leo
the
Fourth
---
and
who
will
say
that
he
admire
them
both
,
as
work
of
extraordinary
genius
---
must
,
as
I
think
,
be
want
in
his
power
of
perception
in
one
of
the
two
instance
,
and
,
probably
,
in
the
high
and
lofty
one
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
suggest
a
doubt
,
but
I
have
a
great
doubt
whether
,
sometimes
,
the
rule
of
art
be
not
too
strictly
observe
,
and
whether
it
be
quite
well
or
agreeable
that
we
should
know
beforehand
,
where
this
figure
will
be
turn
round
,
and
where
that
figure
will
be
lie
down
,
and
where
there
will
be
drapery
in
fold
,
and
so
forth
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
observe
head
inferior
to
the
subject
,
in
picture
of
merit
,
in
italian
gallery
,
I
do
not
attach
that
reproach
to
the
Painter
,
for
I
have
a
suspicion
that
these
great
man
,
who
be
,
of
necessity
,
very
much
in
the
hand
of
monk
and
priest
,
paint
monk
and
priest
a
great
deal
too
often
.
 
<EOS>
I
frequently
see
,
in
picture
of
real
power
,
head
quite
below
the
story
and
the
painter
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
invariably
observe
that
those
head
be
of
the
Convent
stamp
,
and
have
their
counterpart
among
the
convent
inmate
of
this
hour
;
so
,
I
have
settle
with
myself
that
,
in
such
case
,
the
lameness
be
not
with
the
painter
,
but
with
the
vanity
and
ignorance
of
certain
of
his
employer
,
who
would
be
apostle
---
on
canva
,
at
all
event
.
  
<EOS>
the
exquisite
grace
and
beauty
of
Canova
's
statue
;
the
wonderful
gravity
and
repose
of
many
of
the
ancient
work
in
sculpture
,
both
in
the
Capitol
and
the
Vatican
;
and
the
strength
and
fire
of
many
other
;
be
,
in
their
different
way
,
beyond
all
reach
of
word
.
<EOS>
They
be
especially
impressive
and
delightful
,
after
the
work
of
Bernini
and
his
disciple
,
in
which
the
church
of
Rome
,
from
St
Peter
's
downward
,
abound
;
and
which
be
,
I
verily
believe
,
the
most
detestable
class
of
production
in
the
wide
world
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
infinitely
rather
(
as
mere
work
of
art
)
look
upon
the
three
deity
of
the
past
,
the
present
,
and
the
Future
,
in
the
Chinese
Collection
,
than
upon
the
good
of
these
breezy
maniacs
;
whose
every
fold
of
drapery
be
blow
inside
-
out
;
whose
small
vein
,
or
artery
,
be
as
big
as
an
ordinary
forefinger
;
whose
hair
be
like
a
nest
of
lively
snake
;
and
whose
attitude
put
all
other
extravagance
to
shame
.
 
<EOS>
Insomuch
that
I
do
honestly
believe
,
there
can
be
no
place
in
the
world
,
where
such
intolerable
abortion
,
begotten
of
the
sculptor
's
chisel
,
be
to
be
find
in
such
profusion
,
as
in
Rome
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
fine
collection
of
egyptian
antiquity
,
in
the
Vatican
;
and
the
ceiling
of
the
room
in
which
they
be
arrange
,
be
paint
to
represent
a
starlight
sky
in
the
Desert
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
seem
an
odd
idea
,
but
it
be
very
effective
.
 
<EOS>
the
grim
,
half
-
human
monster
from
the
temple
,
look
more
grim
and
monstrous
underneath
the
deep
dark
blue
;
it
shed
a
strange
uncertain
gloomy
air
on
everything
---
a
mystery
adapt
to
the
object
;
and
you
leave
them
,
as
you
find
them
,
shroud
in
a
solemn
night
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
private
palace
,
picture
be
see
to
the
good
advantage
.
<EOS>
there
be
seldom
so
many
in
one
place
that
the
attention
nee
become
distracted
,
or
the
eye
confuse
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
them
very
leisurely
;
and
be
rarely
interrupt
by
a
crowd
of
people
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
portrait
innumerable
,
by
Titian
,
and
Rembrandt
,
and
Vandyke
;
head
by
Guido
,
and
Domenichino
,
and
Carlo
Dolci
;
various
subject
by
Correggio
,
and
Murillo
,
and
Raphael
,
and
Salvator
Rosa
,
and
Spagnoletto
---
many
of
which
it
would
be
difficult
,
indeed
,
to
praise
too
highly
,
or
to
praise
enough
;
such
be
their
tenderness
and
grace
;
their
noble
elevation
,
purity
,
and
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
the
portrait
of
Beatrice
di
Cenci
,
in
the
Palazzo
Berberini
,
be
a
picture
almost
impossible
to
be
forget
.
 
<EOS>
through
the
transcendent
sweetness
and
beauty
of
the
face
,
there
be
a
something
shine
out
,
that
haunt
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
it
now
,
as
I
see
this
paper
,
or
my
pen
.
 
<EOS>
the
head
be
loosely
drape
in
white
;
the
light
hair
fall
down
below
the
linen
fold
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
turn
suddenly
towards
you
;
and
there
be
an
expression
in
the
eye
---
although
they
be
very
tender
and
gentle
---
as
if
the
wildness
of
a
momentary
terror
,
or
distraction
,
have
be
struggle
with
and
overcome
,
that
instant
;
and
nothing
but
a
celestial
hope
,
and
a
beautiful
sorrow
,
and
a
desolate
earthly
helplessness
remain
.
 
<EOS>
some
story
say
that
Guido
paint
it
,
the
night
before
her
execution
;
some
other
story
,
that
he
paint
it
from
memory
,
after
have
see
her
,
on
her
way
to
the
scaffold
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
willing
to
believe
that
,
as
you
see
her
on
his
canvas
,
so
she
turn
towards
him
,
in
the
crowd
,
from
the
first
sight
of
the
axe
,
and
stamp
upon
his
mind
a
look
which
he
have
stamp
on
mine
as
though
I
have
stand
beside
him
in
the
concourse
.
 
<EOS>
the
guilty
palace
of
the
Cenci
:
 
blight
a
whole
quarter
of
the
town
,
as

wither
away

have
that
face

to
my
fancy
,
in
its
dismal
porch
,
and
at
its
black
,
blind
window
,
and
flit
up
and
down
its
dreary
stair
,
and
grow
out
of
the
darkness
of
the
ghostly
gallery
.
 
<EOS>
the
history
be
write

;
write
,
in
the

by
Nature

<EOS>
and
<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
how
in
that
one
touch
she
put
to
flight
(
instead

the
puny
world
that
claim

in

poor
conventional

<EOS>
I
see
in
the
Palazzo
Spada
,
the
statue
of
Pompey
;
the
statue
at
whose
base
Caesar
fall

<EOS>
a
stern

tremendous
figure
!
 
<EOS>
I
imagine
one
of
great
finish
:
 
of
the
last
refinement
:
 
full
of
delicate
touch
:
 
lose
its
distinctness
,
in
the
giddy
eye
of
one
whose
blood
be
ebb
before
it
,
and
settle
into
some
such
rigid
majesty
as
this
,
as
death
come
creep
over
the
upturned
face

<EOS>
the
excursion
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Rome
be
charming
,
and
would
be
full
of
interest
be
it
only
for
the
change
view
they
afford
,
of
the
wild
Campagna
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
every
inch
of
ground
,
in
every
direction
,
be
rich
in
association
,
and
in
natural
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
Albano
,
with
its
lovely
lake
and
wooded
shore
,
and
with
its
wine
,
that
certainly
have
not
improve
since
the
day
of
horace

and
in
these
time
hardly
justify
his
panegyric

<EOS>
there
be
squalid
Tivoli
,
with
the
river
Anio
,
divert
from
its
course
,
and
plunge
down
,
headlong
,
some
eighty
foot
in
search
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
with
its
picturesque
Temple
of
the
Sibyl
,
perch
high
on
a
crag
;
its
minor
waterfall
glance
and
sparkle
in
the
sun
;
and
one
good
cavern
yawn
darkly
,
where
the
river
take
a
fearful
plunge
and
shoot
on
,
low
down
under
beetling
rock
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
too
,
be
the
Villa
d'este
,
desert
and
decay
among
grove
of
melancholy
pine
and
cypress
tree
,
where
it
seem
to
lie
in
state
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
there
be
Frascati
,
and
,
on
the
steep
above
it
,
the
ruin
of
Tusculum
,
where
Cicero
live
,
and
write
,
and
adorn
his
favourite
house
(
some
fragment
of
it
may
yet
be
see
there

,
and
where
Cato

<EOS>
We
see
its
ruin
amphitheatre
on
a
grey
,
dull
day
,
when
a
shrill
March
wind
be
blow
,
and
when
the
scatter
stone
of
the
old
city
lie
strew
about
the
lonely
eminence
,
as
desolate
and
dead
as
the
ashe

a
long

fire
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
we
walk
out
,
a
little
party
of
three
,
to
Albano
,
fourteen
mile
distant
;
possess
by
a
great
desire
to
go
there
by
the
ancient
appian
way
,
long
since
ruin
and
overgrow
.
 
<EOS>
We
start
at
half
-
past
seven
in
the
morning
,
and
within
an
hour
or
so
be
out
upon
the
open
Campagna
.
 
<EOS>
for
twelve
mile
we
go
climb
on
,
over
an
unbroken
succession
of
mound
,
and
heap
,
and
hill
,
of
ruin
.
<EOS>
tomb
and
temple
,
overthrown
and
prostrate
;
small
fragment
of
column
,
frieze
,
pediment
;
great
block
of
granite
and
marble
;
mouldering
arch
,
grass

grow
and
decay
;
ruin
enough
to
build
a
spacious
city
from

lie
strew
about
us
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
loose
wall

build
up
from
these

come
across
our
path
;
sometimes
,
a

between
two
mound
of
broken
stone
,
obstruct
our
progress
;
sometimes
,
the
fragment
themselves
,
roll
from
beneath
our
foot
,
make
it
a
toilsome
matter
to
advance
;
but
it
be
always
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
we
track
a
piece
of
the
old
road
,
above
the
ground
;
now
trace
it
,
underneath
a
grassy
covering
,
as
if
that
be
its
grave
;
but
all
the
way
be
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
distance
,
ruin
aqueduct
go
stalk
on
their
giant
course
along

every

that
sweep
towards
us

stir
early
flower
and
grass
,
spring
up
,
spontaneously
,
on
mile

ruin

<EOS>
the
unseen
lark
above
us
,
who
alone
disturb
the
awful
silence
,
have
their
nest
in
ruin
;
and
the
fierce
herdsman
,
clothe
in
sheepskin
,
who
now
and
then
scowl
out
upon
us
from
their
sleep
nook
,
be
house
in
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
the
aspect
of
the
desolate
Campagna
in
one
direction
,
where
it
be
most
level
,
remind
me
of
an
american
prairie
;
but
what
be
the
solitude
of
a
region
where
man
have
never
dwell
,
to
that
of
a
Desert
,
where
a
mighty
race
have
leave
their
footprint
in
the
earth
from
which
they
have
vanish
;
where
the
resting
-
place
of
their
dead
,
have
fall
like
their
dead
;
and
the
broken
hour
-
glass
of
Time
be
but
a
heap
of
idle
dust
!
<EOS>
return
,
by
the
road
,
at
sunset
!
<EOS>
and
look
,
from
the
distance
,
on
the
course
we
have
take
in
the
morning
<EOS>
,
I
almost
feel
(
as
I
have
feel
when
I
first
see
it
,
at
that
hour
)
as
if
the
sun
would
never
rise
again
,
but
look
its
last
,
that
night
,
upon
a
ruin
world
.
  
<EOS>
to
come
again
on
Rome
,
by
moonlight
,
after
such
an
expedition
,
be
a
fitting
close
to
such
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
the
narrow
street
,
devoid
of
foot

way
,
and
choke
,
in
every
obscure
corner
,
by
heap
of
dunghill
-
rubbish
,
contrast
so
strongly
,
in
their
cramp
dimension
,
and
their
filth
,
and
darkness
,
with
the
broad

before
some
haughty

centre
of
which

bring
from
Egypt
in

look
strangely
on
the
foreign
scene
about
it

or
perhaps
an
ancient
pillar
,
with
its
honoured
statue
overthrow
,
support
a
christian
saint

Marcus

<EOS>
then
,
there
be
the
ponderous
building
rear
from
the
spoliation
of
the
Coliseum
,
shut
out
the

like
mountain

while
here

break

through

<EOS>
the

be
the
quarter
where
the
Jews

when

a
miserable

densely

<EOS>
in
the
day

as
you

along

you

them
all
at
work

upon
the
pavement

oftener

frouzy

crossing

It

you

obelisk

or
column
ancient
temple

theatre

portico

<EOS>
it
be
strange
to
see
<EOS>
,
how
every
fragment
,
whenever
it
be
possible
,
have
be
blend
into
some
modern
structure
,
and
make
to
serve
some
modern
purpose
---
a
wall
,
a
dwelling

place
,
a
granary
,
a
stable
---
some
use
for
which
it
never
be
design

and
associate
with
which
it
can
not
otherwise
than
lamely
assort
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
strange
still
,
to
see
how
many
ruin
of
the
old
mythology
:
 
<EOS>
how
many
fragment
of
obsolete
legend
and
observance
:
 
have
be
incorporate
into
the
worship
of
christian
altar
here
;
and
how
,
in
numberless
respect
,
the
false
faith
and
the
true
be
fuse
into
a
monstrous
union
.
  
<EOS>
from
one
part
of
the
city
,
look
out
beyond
the
wall
,
a
squat
and
stunted
pyramid
(
the
burial
-
place
of
Caius
Cestius
)
make
an
opaque
triangle
in
the
moonlight
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
to
an
english
traveller
,
it
serve
to
mark
the
grave
of
Shelley
too
,
whose
ashe
lie
beneath
a
little
garden
near
it

<EOS>
nearer
still

almost
within
its
shadow

lie
the
bone
of

"
whose

<EOS>
that

<EOS>
the
Holy
Week
in
Rome
be
suppose
to
offer
great
attraction
to
all
visitor
;
but
,
save
for
the
sight
of
Easter
Sunday
,
I
would
counsel
those
who
go
to
Rome
for
its
own
interest
,
to
avoid
it
at
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
the
ceremony
,
in
general
,
be
of
the
most
tedious
and
wearisome
kind
;
the
heat
and
crowd
at
every
one
of
them
,
painfully
oppressive
;
the
noise
,
hubbub
,
and
confusion
,
quite
distracting
.
<EOS>
We
abandon
the
pursuit
of
these
show
,
very
early
in
the
proceeding
,
and
betook
ourselves
to
the
Ruins
again
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
we
plunge
into
the
crowd
for
a
share
of
the
good
of
the
sight
;
and
what
we
see
,
I
will
describe
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
Sistine
chapel
,
on
the
Wednesday
,
we
see
very
little
,
for
by
the
time
we
reach
it
(
though
we
be
early
)
<EOS>
the
besiege
crowd
have
fill
it
to
the
door
,
and
overflow
into
the
adjoin
hall
,
where
they
be
struggle
,
and
squeeze
,
and
mutually
expostulating
,
and
make
great
rush
every
time
a
lady
be
bring
out
faint
,
as
if
at
least
fifty
people
could
be
accommodate
in
her
vacant
standing

room
.
 
<EOS>
hang
in
the
doorway
of
the
chapel
,
be
a
heavy
curtain
,
and
this
curtain
,
some
twenty
people
near
to
it
,
in
their
anxiety
to
hear
the
chaunting
of
the
Miserere
,
be
continually
pluck
at
,
in
opposition
to
each
other
,
that
it
may
not
fall
down
and
stifle
the
sound
of
the
voice
.
 
<EOS>
the
consequence
be
,
that
it
occasion
the
most
extraordinary
confusion
,
and
seem
to
wind
itself
about
the
unwary
,
like
a
Serpent
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
a
lady
be
wrap
up
in
it
,
and
could
not
be
unwound
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
the
voice
of
a
stifle
gentleman
be
hear
inside
it
,
beseech
to
be
let
out
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
two
muffle
arm
,
no
man
could
say
of
which
sex
,
struggle
in
it
as
in
a
sack
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
it
be
carry
by
a
rush
,
bodily
overhead
into
the
chapel
,
like
an
awning
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
it
come
out
the
other
way
,
and
blind
one
of
the
Pope
's
Swiss
Guard
,
who
have
arrive
,
that
moment
,
to
set
thing
to
right
.
  
<EOS>
be
seat
at
a
little
distance
,
among
two
or
three
of
the
Pope
's
gentleman
,
who
be
very
weary
and
count
the
minute
---
as
perhaps
his
Holiness
be
too
---
we
have
well
opportunity
of
observe
this
eccentric
entertainment
,
than
of
hear
the
Miserere
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
there
be
a
swell
of
mournful
voice
that
sound
very
pathetic
and
sad
,
and
die
away
,
into
a
low
strain
again
;
but
that
be
all
we
hear
.
  
<EOS>
at
another
time
,
there
be
the
exhibition
of
Relics
in
St
Peter
's
,
which
take
place
at
between
six
and
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
and
be
strike
from
the
cathedral
be
dark
and
gloomy
,
and
have
a
great
many
people
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
place
into
which
the
relic
be
bring
,
one
by
one
,
by
a
party
of
three
priest
,
be
a
high
balcony
near
the
chief
altar
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
only
light
part
of
the
church
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
always
a
hundred
and
twelve
lamp
burn
near
the
altar
,
and
there
be
two
tall
taper
,
besides
,
near
the
black
statue
of
St
Peter
;
but
these
be
nothing
in
such
an
immense
edifice
.
 
<EOS>
the
gloom
,
and
the
general
upturning
of
face
to
the
balcony
,
and
the
prostration
of
true
believer
on
the
pavement
,
as
shine
object
,
like
picture
or
looking

glass
,
be
bring
out
and

have
something
effective
in
it
,
despite
the
very
preposterous
manner
in
which
they
be
hold
up
for
the
general
edification
,
and
the
great
elevation
at
which
they
be
display
;
which
one
would
think
rather
calculated
to
diminish
the
comfort
derivable
from
a
full
conviction
of
their
be
genuine
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
Thursday
,
we
go
to
see
the
Pope
convey
the
Sacrament
from
the
Sistine
chapel
,
to
deposit
it
in
the
Capella
Paolina
,
another
chapel
in
the
Vatican
;
---
a
ceremony
emblematical
of
the
entombment
of
the
Saviour
before
His
Resurrection
.
 
<EOS>
We
wait
in
a
great
gallery
with
a
great
crowd
of
people
(
three
-
fourth
of
them
English
)
for
an
hour
or
so
,
while
they
be
chaunte
the
Miserere
,
in
the
Sistine
chapel
again
.
 
<EOS>
both
chapel
open
out
of
the
gallery
;
and
the
general
attention
be
concentrate
on
the
occasional
opening
and
shutting
of
the
door
of
the
one
for
which
the
Pope
be
ultimately
bind
.
 
<EOS>
none
of
these
opening
disclose
anything
more
tremendous
than
a
man
on
a
ladder
,
light
a
great
quantity
of
candle
;
but
at
each
and
every
opening
,
there
be
a
terrific
rush
make
at
this
ladder
and
this
man
,
something
like
(
I
should
think
)
<EOS>
a
charge
of
the
heavy
british
cavalry
at
Waterloo
.
<EOS>
the
man
be
never
bring
down
,
however
,
nor
the
ladder
;
for
it
perform
the
strange
antic
in
the
world
among
the
crowd
---
where
it
be
carry
by
the
man
,
when
the
candle
be
all
light
;
and
finally
it
be
stick
up
against
the
gallery
wall
,
in
a
very
disorderly
manner
,
just
before
the
opening
of
the
other
chapel
,
and
the
commencement
of
a
new
chaunt
,
announce
the
approach
of
his
Holiness
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
crisis
,
the
soldier
of
the
guard
,
who
have
be
poke
the
crowd
into
all
sort
of
shape
,
form
down
the
gallery
:
and
the
procession
come
up
,
between
the
two
line
they
make
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
few
chorister
,
and
then
a
great
many
priest
,
walk
two
and
two
,
and
carry
---
the
good
-
look
priest
at
least
---
their
light
taper
,
so
as
to
throw
the
light
with
a
good
effect
upon
their
face
:
 
for
the
room
be
darken
.
 
<EOS>
those
who
be
not
handsome
,
or
who
have
not
long
beard
,
carry
their
taper
anyhow
,
and
abandon
themselves
to
spiritual
contemplation
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
chaunting
be
very
monotonous
and
dreary
.
 
<EOS>
the
procession
pass
on
,
slowly
,
into
the
chapel
,
and
the
drone
of
voice
go
on
,
and
come
on
,
with
it
,
until
the
Pope
himself
appear
,
walk
under
a
white
satin
canopy
,
and
bear
the
covered
Sacrament
in
both
hand
;
cardinal
and
canon
cluster
round
him
,
make
a
brilliant
show
.
 
<EOS>
the
soldier
of
the
guard
kneel
down
as
he
pass
;
all
the
bystander
bow
;
and
so
he
pass
on
into
the
chapel
:
 
<EOS>
the
white
satin
canopy
be
remove
from
over
him
at
the
door
,
and
a
white
satin
parasol
hoist
over
his
poor
old
head
,
in
place
of
it
.
<EOS>
a
few
more
couple
bring
up
the
rear
,
and
pass
into
the
chapel
also
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
the
chapel
door
be
shut
;
and
it
be
all
over
;
and
everybody
hurry
off
headlong
,
as
for
life
or
death
,
to
see
something
else
,
and
say
it
be
not
worth
the
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
the
most
popular
and
most
crowded
sight
(
except
those
of
Easter
Sunday
and
Monday
,
which
be
open
to
all
class
of
people
)
be
the
Pope
wash
the
foot
of
thirteen
man
,
represent
the
twelve
apostle
,
and
Judas
Iscariot
.
 
<EOS>
the
place
in
which
this
pious
office
be
perform
,
be
one
of
the
chapel
of
St
Peter
's
,
which
be
gaily
decorate
for
the
occasion
;
the
thirteen
sit
,
"
all
of
a
row
,
"
on
a
very
high
bench
,
and
look
particularly
uncomfortable
,
with
the
eye
of
Heaven
know
how
many
English
,
French
,
Americans
,
Swiss
,
Germans
,
Russians
,
Swedes
,
Norwegians
,
and
other
foreigner
,
nail
to
their
face
all
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
robe
in
white
;
and
on
their
head
they
wear
a
stiff
white
cap
,
like
a
large
english
porter
-
pot
,
without
a
handle
.
 
<EOS>
each
carry
in
his
hand
,
a
nosegay
,
of
the
size
of
a
fine
cauliflower
;
and
two
of
them
,
on
this
occasion
,
wear
spectacle
;
<EOS>
which
,
remember
the
character
they
sustain
,
I
think
a
droll
appendage
to
the
costume
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
eye
to
character
.
 
<EOS>
St
John
be
represent
by
a
good
-
look
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
St
Peter
,
by
a
grave
-
look
old
gentleman
,
with
a
flow
brown
beard
;
and
Judas
Iscariot
by
such
an
enormous
hypocrite
<EOS>
(
I
could
not
make
out
,
though
,
whether
the
expression
of
his
face
be
real
or
assume
)
that
if
he
have
act
the
part
to
the
death
and
have
go
away
and
hang
himself
,
he
would
have
leave
nothing
to
be
desire
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
two
large
box
,
appropriate
to
lady
at
this
sight
,
be
full
to
the
throat
,
and
get
near

we
post
off

along

a
great
crowd
,
to
be
in

at
the
Table
,
where
the
Pope
,
in
person

wait
on
these
thirteen
;
and
after
a
prodigious
struggle
at
the
Vatican
staircase
,
and
several
personal
conflict
with
the
swiss
guard
,
the
whole
crowd
sweep
into
the
room

<EOS>
It
be
a
long
gallery
hang
with
drapery
of
white

with
another

box
for
lady

,
a
royal
box
for
the
King
of
Naples
and
his

the

set

the

knife
and
fork
be
lay
out
on
that
side
of
the
table
which
be
near

so
that
they
may

without

<EOS>
the
body
of
the
room
be
full
of
male
stranger
;
the
crowd
immense
;
the
heat
very
great

and
the
pressure
sometimes
frightful

<EOS>
It
be
at
its
height
,
when
the
stream
come
pour
in
,
from
the
foot

washing
;
and
then
there
be
such
shriek
and
outcry
,
that
a
party
of
piedmontese
dragoon
go
to
the
rescue
of
the
swiss
guard
,
and
help
them
to
calm
the
tumult

<EOS>
the

particularly
ferocious

<EOS>
one

who
improve
her
position
by
stick
a

before
her

<EOS>
the
gentleman
about
me
be
remarkably
anxious
to
see
what
be
on
the
table
;
and
one
Englishman
seem
to
have
embark
the
whole
energy
of
his
nature
in
the
determination
to
discover
whether
there
be
any
mustard

<EOS>
"

I

"
  
<EOS>
the
apostle
and
Judas
appear
on
the
platform

after
much
expectation

be
marshal

in
line

in

twelve

and
Judas

move
his
lip
very
obtrusively

engage
in
inward
prayer

<EOS>
then

the
Pope

clothe
in
a
scarlet
robe

and
wear
on
his
head
a
skull

cap
of
white

appear

of
a

of
cardinal

a

from

<EOS>
this
his
Holiness
perform

with
considerable
expedition
,
on
every
man
in
the
line
<EOS>
(
Judas
,
I
observe
,
to
be
particularly
overcome
by
his
condescension

;

then
the

Thirteen

down
to
dinner

Grace

<EOS>
the

the
Thirteen

<EOS>
the
manner
in
which
Judas
grow
more
white
-
livere
over
his
victual
,
and
languish
,
with
his
head
on
one
side
,
as
if
he
have
no
appetite
,
defy
all
description
.
<EOS>
Peter
be
a
good
,
sound
,
old
man
,
and
go
in
,
as
the
saying
be
,
"
to
win
;
"
eat
everything
that
be
give
him
(
he
get
the
good
:
be
first
in

row
)
and
say
nothing
to
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
the
dish
appear
to
be
chiefly
compose
of
fish
and
vegetable
.
 
<EOS>
the
Pope
help
the
Thirteen
to
wine
also
;
and
,
during
the
whole
dinner
,
somebody
read
something
aloud
,
out
of
a
large
book
---
the
Bible
,
I
presume
---
which
nobody
could
hear
,
and
to
which
nobody
pay
the
least
attention
.
 
<EOS>
the
Cardinals
,
and
other
attendant
,
smile
to
each
other
,
from
time
to
time

as
if
the
thing
be
a
great
farce
;
and
if
they
think
so
,
there
be
little
doubt
they
be
perfectly
right

<EOS>
His
Holiness
do
what
he
have
to
do
,
as
a
sensible
man
get
through
a
troublesome
ceremony
,
and
seem
very
glad
when
it
be
all
over
.
  
<EOS>
the
Pilgrims
'
supper
:
 
where
lord
and
lady
wait
on
the
Pilgrims
,
in
token
of
humility
,
and
dry
their
foot
when
they
have
be
well
wash
by
deputy
:
 
be
very
attractive
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
of
all
the
many
spectacle
of
dangerous
reliance
on
outward
observance
,
in
themselves
mere
empty
form
,
none
strike
me
half
so
much
as
the
Scala
Santa
,
or
Holy
Staircase
,
which
I
see
several
time
,
but
to
the
great
advantage
,
or
disadvantage
,
on
Good
Friday
.
  
<EOS>
this
holy
staircase
be
compose
of
eight
-
and
-
twenty
step
,
say
to
have
belong
to
Pontius
Pilate

house
and
to
be
the
identical
stair
on
which
Our
Saviour
trod
,
in
come
down
from
the
judgment
-
seat
.
<EOS>
Pilgrims
ascend
it
,
only
on
their
knee
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
steep
;
and
,
at
the
summit
,
be
a
chapel
,
report
to
be
full
of
relic
;
into
which
they
peep
through
some
iron
bar
,
and
then
come
down
again
,
by
one
of
two
side
staircase
,
which
be
not
sacred
,
and
may
be
walk
on
.
  
<EOS>
on
Good
Friday
,
there
be
,
on
a
moderate
computation
,
a
hundred
people
,
slowly
shuffle
up
these
stair
,
on
their
knee
,
at
one
time
;
while
other
,
who
be
go
up
,
or
have
come
down
---
and
a
few
who
have
do
both
,
and
be
go
up
again
for
the
second
time
---
stand
loiter
in
the
porch
below
,
where
an
old
gentleman
in
a
sort
of
watch
-
box
,
rattle
a
tin
canister
,
with
a
slit
in
the
top
,
incessantly
,
to
remind
them
that
he
take
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
the
majority
be
country
-
people
,
male
and
female
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
four
or
five
Jesuit
priest
,
however
,
and
some
half
-
dozen
well
-
dress
woman
.
 
<EOS>
a
whole
school
of
boy
,
twenty
at
least
,
be
about
half
-
way
up
---
evidently
enjoy
it
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
all
wedge
together
,
pretty
closely
;
but
the
rest
of
the
company
give
the
boy
as
wide
a
berth
as
possible
,
in
consequence
of
their
betray
some
recklessness
in
the
management
of
their
boot
.
  
<EOS>
I
never
,
in
my
life
,
see
anything
at
once
so
ridiculous
,
and
so
unpleasant
,
as
this
sight
---
ridiculous
in
the
absurd
incident
inseparable
from
it
;
and
unpleasant
in
its
senseless
and
unmeaning
degradation
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
two
step
to
begin
with
,
and
then
a
rather
broad
landing
.
 
<EOS>
the
more
rigid
climber
go
along
this
landing
on
their
knee
,
as
well
as
up
the
stair
;
and
the
figure
they
cut
,
in
their
shuffling
progress
over
the
level
surface
,
no
description
can
paint
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
to
see
them
watch
their
opportunity
from
the
porch
,
and
cut
in
where
there
be
a
place
next
the
wall
!
 
<EOS>
and
to
see
one
man
with
an
umbrella
(
bring
on
purpose
,
for
it
be
a
fine
day
)
hoist
himself
,
unlawfully
,
from
stair
to
stair
!
 
<EOS>
and
to
observe
a
demure
lady
of
fifty
-
five
or
so
,
look
back
,
every
now
and
then
,
to
assure
herself
that
her
leg
be
properly
dispose
!
  
<EOS>
there
be
such
odd
difference
in
the
speed
of
different
people
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
some
get
on
as
if
they
be
do
a
match
against
time
;
other
stop
to
say
a
prayer
on
every
step
.
 
<EOS>
this
man
touch
every
stair
with
his
forehead
,
and
kiss
it
;
that
man
scratch
his
head
all
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
the
boy
get
on
brilliantly
,
and
be
up
and
down
again
before
the
old
lady
have
accomplish
her
half
-
dozen
stair
.
 
<EOS>
but
most
of
the
penitent
come
down
,
very
sprightly
and
fresh
,
as
have
do
a
real
good
substantial
deed
which
it
would
take
a
good
deal
of
sin
to
counterbalance
;
and
the
old
gentleman
in
the
watch
-
box
be
down
upon
them
with
his
canister
while
they
be
in
this
humour
,
I
promise
you
.
  
<EOS>
as
if
such
a
progress
be
not
in
its
nature
inevitably
droll
enough
,
there
lie
,
on
the
top
of
the
stair
,
a
wooden
figure
on
a
crucifix
,
rest
on
a
sort
of
great
iron
saucer
:
 
<EOS>
so
rickety
and
unsteady
,
that
whenever
an
enthusiastic
person
kiss
the
figure
,
with
more
than
usual
devotion
,
or
throw
a
coin
into
the
saucer
,
with
more
than
common
readiness
(
for
it
serve
in
this
respect
as
a
second
or
supplementary
canister
)
,
it
give
a
great
leap
and
rattle
,
and
nearly
shake
the
attendant
lamp
out
:
 
horribly
frighten
the
people
further
down
,
and
throw
the
guilty
party
into
unspeakable
embarrassment
.
  
<EOS>
on
Easter
Sunday
,
as
well
as
on
the
precede
Thursday
,
the
Pope
bestow
his
benediction
on
the
people
,
from
the
balcony
in
front

<EOS>
this
Easter
Sunday
be
a
day
so
bright
and
blue
:
 
so
cloudless
,
balmy
,
<EOS>
wonderfully
bright
:
 
that
all
the
previous
bad
weather
vanish
from
the
recollection
in
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
the
Thursday
's
Benediction
drop
damply
on
some
hundred
of
umbrella
,
but
there
be
not
a
sparkle
then
,
in
all
the
hundred
fountain
of
Rome
---
<EOS>
such
fountain
as
they
be
!
<EOS>
---
and
on
this
Sunday
morning
they
be
run
diamond
.
 
<EOS>
the
mile
of
miserable
street
through
which
we
drive
(
compel
to
a
certain
course
by
the
Pope
's
dragoon
:
 
the
roman
police
on
such
occasion
)
be
so
full
of
colour
,
that
nothing
in
them
be
capable
of
wear
a
fade
aspect
.
 
<EOS>
the
common
people
come
out
in
their
gay
dress
;
the
rich
people
in
their
smart
vehicle
;
cardinal
rattle
to
the
church
of
the
Poor
Fishermen
in
their
state
carriage
;
shabby
magnificence
flaunt
its
thread
-
bare
livery
and
tarnish
cocked
hat
,
in
the
sun
;
and
every
coach
in
Rome
be
put
in
requisition
for
the
Great
Piazza
of
St
Peter
's
.
  
<EOS>
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
people
be
there
at
least
!
 
<EOS>
yet
there
be
ample
room
.
 
<EOS>
how
many
carriage
be
there
,
I
do
not
know
;
yet
there
be
room
for
them
too
,
and
to
spare
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
step
of
the
church
be
densely
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
many
of
the
Contadini
,
from
Albano
(
who
delight
in
red
)
,
in
that
part
of
the
square
,
and
the
mingling
of
bright
colour
in
the
crowd
be
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
below
the
step
the
troop
be
range
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
magnificent
proportion
of
the
place
they
look
like
a
bed
of
flower
.
 
<EOS>
Sulky

<EOS>
a

the
front
of
the
balcony
;
and
the
side
of
the
great

be
bedeck
with
crimson
drapery
.
<EOS>
an
awning
be
stretch

too

over

to

from
the
hot
ray
of

<EOS>
as

<EOS>
in

then
rise
up

and
stretch
out
its
tiny

while
all
the
male
spectator
in
the
square
uncover

and

but
not

any

<EOS>
the

of
the
Castle

proclaim
,
next
moment

that
the
benediction

and
the
great
mass
below

suddenly
break
into
small
heap
,
and
scatter
here
and
there
in
rill
,
be
stir
like
parti

coloured

.
  
<EOS>
what
a
bright
noon
it
be
,
as
we
ride
away
!
 
<EOS>
the
Tiber
be
no
longer
yellow
,
but
blue
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
blush
on
the
old
bridge
,
that
make
them
fresh
and
hale
again
.
 
<EOS>
the
Pantheon
,
with
its
majestic
front
,
all
seam
and
furrow
like
an
old
face
,
have
summer
light
upon
its
battered
wall
.
 
<EOS>
every
squalid
and
desolate
hut
in
the
Eternal
City
(
bear
witness
every
grim
old
palace
,
to
the
filth
and
misery
of
the
plebeian
neighbour
that
elbow

as
certain
as
Time

lay
its
grip
on
its
patrician
head

)
be
fresh
and
new
with
some
ray
of
the
sun
.
 
<EOS>
the
very
prison
in
the
crowded
street
,
a
whirl
of
carriage
and
people
,
have
some
stray
sense
of
the
day
,
drop
through
its
chink
and
crevice
:
 
and
dismal
prisoner
who
could
not
wind
their
face
round
the
barricading
of
the
block
-
up
window
,
stretch
out
their
hand
,
and
cling
to
the
rusty
bar
,
turn
them
towards
the
overflow
street
:
 
as
if
it
be
a
cheerful
fire
,
and
could
be
share
in
,
that
way
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
when
the
night
come
on
,
without
a
cloud
to
dim
the
full
moon
,
what
a
sight
it
be
to
see
the
Great
Square
full
once
more
,
and
the
whole
church
,
from
the
cross
to
the
ground
,
light
with
innumerable
lantern
,
trace
out
the
architecture
,
and
wink
and
shine
all
round
the
colonnade
of
the
piazza
!
 
<EOS>
and
what
a
sense
of
exultation
,
joy
,
delight
<EOS>
,
it
be
,
when
the
great
bell
strike
half
-
past
seven
---
on
the
instant
---
to
behold
one
bright
red
mass
of
fire
,
soar
gallantly
from
the
top
of
the
cupola
to
the
extremest
summit
of
the
cross
,
and
the
moment
it
leap
into
its
place
,
become
the
signal
of
a
bursting
out
of
countless
light
,
as
great
,
and
red
,
and
blaze
as
itself
,
from
every
part
of
the
gigantic
church
;
so
that
every
cornice
,
capital
,
and
small
ornament
of
stone
,
express
itself
in
fire
:
 
and
the
black
,
solid
groundwork
of
the
enormous
dome
seem
to
grow
transparent
as
an
egg
-
shell
!
  
<EOS>
a
train
of
gunpowder
,
an
electric
chain
---
nothing
could
be
fire
,
more
suddenly
and
swiftly
,
than
this
second
illumination
;
and
when
we
have
get
away
,
and
go
upon
a
distant
height
,
and
look
towards
it
two
hour
afterwards
,
there
it
still
stand
,
shine
and
glitter
in
the
calm
night
like
a
jewel
!
 
<EOS>
not
a
line
of
its
proportion
want
;
not
an
angle
blunt
;
not
an
atom
of
its
radiance
lose
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
night
---
Easter
Monday
---
there
be
a
great
display
of
firework
from
the
Castle
of
St
Angelo
.
 
<EOS>
We
hire
a
room
in
an
opposite
house
,
and
make
our
way
,
to
our
place
,
in
good
time
,
through
a
dense
mob
of
people
choke
up
the
square
in
front
,
and
all
the
avenue
lead
to
it
;
and
so
load
the
bridge
by
which
the
castle
be
approach
,
that
it
seem
ready
to
sink
into
the
rapid
Tiber
below
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
statue
on
this
bridge
(
execrable
work
)
,
and
,
among
them
,
great
vessel
full
of
burn
tow
be
place
:
 
glare
strangely
on
the
face
of
the
crowd
,
and
not
less
strangely
on
the
stone
counterfeit
above
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
show
begin
with
a
tremendous
discharge
of
cannon
;
and
then
,
for
twenty
minute
or
half
an
hour
,
the
whole
castle
be
one
incessant
sheet
of
fire
,
and
labyrinth
of
blaze
wheel
of
every
colour
,
size
,
and
speed
:
 
while
rocket
stream
into
the
sky
,
not
by
one
or
two
,
or
score
,
but
hundred
at
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
the
concluding
burst
---
the
Girandola
---
be
like
the
blowing
up
into
the
air
of
the
whole
massive
castle
,
without
smoke
or
dust
.
  
<EOS>
in
half
an
hour
afterwards
,
the
immense
concourse
have
disperse
;
the
moon
be
look
calmly
down
upon
her
wrinkle
image
in
the
river
;
and
half
-
a
-
dozen
man
and
boy
,
with
bit
of
lighted
candle
in
their
hand
:
 
move
here
and
there
,
in
search
of
anything
worth
have
,
that
may
have
be
drop
in
the
press
:
 
have
the
whole
scene
to
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
by
way
of
contrast
we
ride
out
into
old
ruin
Rome
,
after
all
this
firing
and
booming
,
to
take
our
leave
of
the
Coliseum
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
it
by
moonlight
before
(
I
could
never
get
through
a
day
without
go
back
to
it
)
,
but
its
tremendous
solitude
that
night
be
past
all
tell
.
 
<EOS>
the
ghostly
pillar
in
the
Forum
;
the
Triumphal
Arches
of
Old
Emperors
;
those
enormous
masse
of
ruin
which
be
once
their
palace
;
the
grass
-
grow
mound
that
mark
the
grave
of
ruin
temple
;
the
stone
of
the
Via
Sacra
,
smooth
with
the
tread
of
foot
in
ancient
Rome
<EOS>
;
even
these
be
dim
,
in
their
transcendent
melancholy
,
by
the
dark
ghost
of
its
bloody
holiday
,
erect
and
grim
;
haunt
the
old
scene
;
despoil
by
pillage
Popes
and
fight
prince
,
but
not
lay
;
wring
wild
hand
of
weed
,
and
grass
,
and
bramble
;
and
lament
to
the
night
in
every
gap
and
broken
arch
---
the
shadow
of
its
awful
self
,
immovable
!
  
<EOS>
as
we
lay
down
on
the
grass
of
the
Campagna
,
next
day
,
on
our
way
to
Florence
,
hear
the
lark
sing
,
we
see
that
a
little
wooden
cross
have
be
erect
on
the
spot
where
the
poor
Pilgrim
Countess
be
murder
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
we
pile
some
loose
stone
about
it
,
as
the
beginning
of
a
mound
to
her
memory
,
and
wonder
if
we
should
ever
rest
there
again
,
and
look
back
at
Rome
.
    
<EOS>
a
Rapid
Diorama
 
we
be
bind
for
Naples
!
 
<EOS>
and
we
cross
the
threshold
of
the
Eternal
City
at
yonder
gate
,
the
Gate
of
San
Giovanni
Laterano
,
where
the
two
last
object
that
attract
the
notice
of
a
depart
visitor
,
and
the
two
first
object
that
attract
the
notice
of
an
arrive
one
,
be
a
proud
church
and
a
decaying
ruin
---
good
emblem
of
Rome
.
  
<EOS>
Our
way
lie
over
the
Campagna
,
which
look
more
solemn
on
a
bright
blue
day
like
this
,
than
beneath
a
dark
sky
;
the
great
extent
of
ruin
be
plainer
to
the
eye
:
 
and
the
sunshine
through
the
arch
of
the
broken
aqueduct
,
show
other
broken
arch
shine
through
them
in
the
melancholy
distance
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
have
traverse
it
,
and
look
back
from
Albano
,
<EOS>
its
dark
,
undulate
surface
lie
below
us
like
a
stagnant
lake
,
or
like
a
broad
,
dull
Lethe
flow
round
the
wall
of
Rome
,
and
separate
it
from
all
the
world
!
 
<EOS>
how
often
have
the
Legions
,
in
triumphant
march
,
go
glitter
across
that
purple
waste
,
so
silent
and
unpeopled
now
!
 
<EOS>
how
often
have
the
train
of
captive
look
,
with
sink
heart
,
upon
the
distant
city
,
and
beheld
its
population
pour
out
,
to
hail
the
return
of
their
conqueror
!
 
<EOS>
what
riot
,
sensuality
and
murder
,
have
run
mad
in
the
vast
palace
now
heap
of
brick
and
shatter
marble
!
 
<EOS>
what
glare
of
fire
,
and
roar
of
popular
tumult
,
and
wail
of
pestilence
and
famine
,
have
come
sweep
over
the
wild
plain
where
nothing

but

wind

and
where

be

and
we
go
toil
up
into
a
high
country
where
there
be
tree
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
day
bring
us
on
the
Pontine
marsh
,
wearily
flat
and
lonesome
,
and
overgrow
with
brushwood
,
and
swamp
with
water
,
but
with
a
fine
road
make
across
them
,
shade
by
a
long
,
long
avenue
.
 
<EOS>
here
and
there
,
we
pass
a
solitary
guard
-
house
;
here
and
there
a
hovel

desert

and
wall
up

<EOS>
some

loiter
on

beside

occasionally

there

of
Terracina

<EOS>
how

roll
below
the
window
of

the

after
two

the
hungriest

officer
with
difficulty
appeased

we
enter

by
a
gateless
portal
,
into
the
first
Neapolitan
town
---
Fondi
.
 
<EOS>
take
note
of
Fondi
,
in
the
name
of
all
that
be
wretched

beggarly

<EOS>
a
filthy
channel

there

Fondi

but
be

crazy

rot
away

<EOS>
the
wretched
history
of
the
town
,
with
all
its
siege
and
pillage
by
Barbarossa
and
the
rest

may
have
be
act
last

<EOS>
how

gaunt

that
sneak
about
the
miserable
street
,
come
to
be
alive
,
and
undevoure
by
the
people
,
be
one
of
the
enigmas
of
the

<EOS>
a

all

some

indolent

down

or

too
wisely
mistrustful
of

perhaps
,
to
venture
:

so
stretch
out
their

It

<EOS>
stand

then

at

the

the

all
render
the
solitude

deadly
lonesomeness
of
the

ten

more
solemn

than

the

in
its

sweep
the

it

It

on

day

very
cold

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
let
us
take
advantage

the
fine
weather
;
make
the
good
of
our
way
to
Resina
,
the
little
village
at
the
foot
of

prepare
ourselves
,
as
well
as

on

short

at

every

into

participate
in
the
tumult

after
much

twenty

<EOS>
We
ascend
,
gradually
,
by
stony
lane
like
rough
broad
flight
of
stair
,
for
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
we
leave
these
,
and
the
vineyard
on
either
side
of
them
,
and
emerge
upon
a
bleak
bare
region
where
the
lava
lie
confusedly
,
in
enormous
rusty
masse
;
as
if
the
earth
have
be
plough
up
by
burn
thunderbolt

<EOS>
and
now
,
we
halt
to
see
the
sun
set

<EOS>
the
change
that
fall
upon
the
dreary
region
,
and
on
the
whole
mountain

as
its
red
light
fade

and
the
night
come
on

and
the
unutterable
solemnity
and
dreariness
that
reign
around

who
that

witness
it

can
ever
forget
!
  
<EOS>
It
be
dark
,
when
after
wind
,
for
some
time
,
over
the
broken
ground
,
we
arrive
at
the
foot
of
the
cone
:
 
which
be
extremely
steep
,
and
seem
to
rise
,
almost
perpendicularly
,
from
the
spot
where
we
dismount

<EOS>
the
only
light

the

deep

hard

with
which

<EOS>
It

now
intensely

<EOS>
the
thirty

one
have
bring
no

know

the

will
rise
before

the
top

<EOS>
two

the
litter
be
devoted
to
the
two
lady
;
the
third
,
to
a
rather
heavy
gentleman
from
Naples
,
whose
hospitality
and
good

nature
have
attach
him
to
the
expedition
,
and
determine
him
to

the
honour
of

<EOS>
the
rather
heavy
gentleman
be
carry
by
fifteen
man

each
of
the
lady
by
half

a

dozen

<EOS>
We
who
walk
,
make
the
good
use
of
our
stave
;
and
so
the
whole
party
begin
to
labour
upward
over
the
snow
,
---
as
if
they
be
toil
to
the
summit
of
an
antediluvian
Twelfth

cake
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
a
long
time
toil
up
;
and
the
head

guide
look
oddly
about
him
when
one
of
the
company
---
not
an
Italian

though
an
habitue

the
mountain
for
many
year

whom
we

as
it

freeze
hard

the
usual
footing
of

be
cover
by
the
snow

ice
,
it
will
surely
be
difficult
to
descend
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
sight
of
the

above

tilt
up

down
,
and
jerk
from
this
side
to
that

as
the

continually
slip

divert
our
attention
;
more
especially

the
whole

the
rather
heavy

at
that
moment

<EOS>
present
to

alarmingly
foreshortened

downwards

It

"
<EOS>
they
press
on

gallantly
,
for
the
summit
.
  
<EOS>
from
tinge
the
top
of
the
snow
above
us
,
with
a
band
of
light
,
and
pour
it
in
a
stream
through
the

while

<EOS>
the
whole
prospect
be
in
this
lovely
state

when
we
come
upon
the
platform
on
the
mountain

top
---
the
region
of
Fire

an
exhausted

great

blacken
it
with
smoke
,
and
spot
it
with
red
-
hot
stone
and
cinder
,
that
fly
up
into
the
air
like
feather
,
and
fall
down
like
lead
.
 
<EOS>
what
word
can
paint
the
gloom
and
grandeur
of
this
scene
!
  
<EOS>
the
broken
ground
;
the
smoke
;
the
sense
of
suffocation
from
the
sulphur
:
 
the
fear
of
fall
down
through
the
crevice
in
the
yawning
ground
;
the
stopping
,
every
now
and
then
,
for
somebody
who
be
miss
in
the
dark
(
for
the
dense
smoke
now
obscure
the
moon
)
;
the
intolerable
noise
of
the
thirty
;
and
the
hoarse
roaring
of
the
mountain
;
make
it
a
scene
of
such
confusion
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
we
reel
again
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
drag
the
lady
through
it
,
and
across
another
exhausted
crater
to
the
foot
of
the
present
volcano
,
we
approach
close
to
it
on
the
windy
side
,
and
then
sit
down
among
the
hot
ashe
at
its
foot
,
and
look
up
in
silence
;
faintly
estimate
the
action
that
be
go
on
within
,
from
its
be
full
a
hundred
foot
high
,
at
this
minute
,
than
it
be
six
week
ago
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
the
fire
and
roar
,
that
generate
an
irresistible
desire
to
get
near
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
can
not
rest
long
,
without
start
off
,
two
of
us
,
on
our
hand
and
knee
,
accompany
by
the
head
-
guide
,
to
climb
to
the
brim
of
the
flame
crater
,
and
try
to
look
in
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
thirty
yell
,
as
with
one
voice
,
that
it
be
a
dangerous
proceeding
,
and
call
to
us
to
come
back
;
frighten
the
rest
of
the
party
out
of
their
wit
.
  
<EOS>
what
with
their
noise
,
and
what
with
the
trembling
of
the
thin
crust
of
ground
,
that
seem
about
to
open
underneath
our
foot
and
plunge
us
in
the
burn
gulf
below
(
which
be
the
real
danger
,
if
there
be
any
)
;
and
what
with
the
flashing
of
the
fire
in
our
face
,
and
the
shower
of
red
-
hot
ashe
that
be
rain
down
,
and
the
choking
smoke
and
sulphur
;
we
may
well
feel
giddy
and
irrational
,
like
drunken
man
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
we
contrive
to
climb
up
to
the
brim
,
and
look
down
,
for
a
moment
,
into
the
Hell
of
boil
fire
below
.
<EOS>
then
,
we
all
three
come
roll
down
;
blacken
,
and
singe
,
and
scorch
,
and
hot
,
and
giddy
:
 
and
each
with
his
dress
alight
in
half
-
a
-
dozen
place
.
  
<EOS>
You
have
read
,
a
thousand
time
,
that
the
usual
way
of
descending
,
be
,
by
slide
down
the
ashe
:
 
which
,
form
a
gradually
-
increase
ledge
below
the
foot
,
prevent
too
rapid
a
descent
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
when
we
have
cross
the
two
exhausted
crater
on
our
way
back
and
be
come
to
this
precipitous
place
,
there
be
(
<EOS>
as
Mr
Pickle
have
foretold
)
<EOS>
no
vestige
of
ashe
to
be
see
;
the
whole
be
a
smooth
sheet
of
ice
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
dilemma
,
ten
or
a
dozen
of
the
guide
cautiously
join
hand
,
and
make
a
chain
of
man
;
of
whom
the
foremost
beat
,
as
well
as
they
can
,
a
rough
track
with
their
stick
,
down
which
we
prepare
to
follow
.
 
<EOS>
the
way
be
fearfully
steep
,
and
none
of
the
party
:
even
of
the
thirty
:
 
be
able
to
keep
their
foot
for
six
pace
together
,
the
lady
be
take
out
of
their
litter
,
and
place
,
each
between
two
careful
person
;
while
other
of
the
thirty
hold
by
their
skirt
,
to
prevent
their
fall
forward
---
a
necessary
precaution
,
tend
to
the
immediate
and
hopeless
dilapidation
of
their
apparel
.
 
<EOS>
the
rather
heavy
gentleman
be
abjure
to
leave
his
litter
too
,
and
be
escort
in
a
similar
manner
;
but
he
resolve
to
be
bring
down
as
he
be
bring
up
,
on
the
principle
that
his
fifteen
bearer
be
not
likely
to
tumble
all
at
once
,
and
that
he
be
safe
so
,
than
trust
to
his
own
leg
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
order
,
we
begin
the
descent
:
 
sometimes
on
foot
,
sometimes
shuffle
on
the
ice
:
 
always
proceed
much
more
quietly
and
slowly
,
than
on
our
upward
way
:
 
and
constantly
alarm
by
the
falling
among
us
of
somebody
from
behind
,
who
endanger
the
footing
of
the
whole
party
,
and
cling
pertinaciously
to
anybody
's
ankle
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
the
litter
to
be
in
advance
,
too
,
as
the
track
have
to
be
make
;
and
its
appearance
behind
us
,
overhead
---
with
some
one
or
other
of
the
bearer
always
down
,
and
the
rather
heavy
gentleman
with
his
leg
always
in
the
air
---
be
very
threatening
and
frightful
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
go
on
thus
,
a
very
little
way
,
painfully
and
anxiously
,
but
quite
merrily
,
and
regard
it
as
a
great
success
---
and
have
all
fall
several
time
,
and
have
all
be
stop
,
somehow
or
other
,
as
we
be
slide
away
---
when
Mr
Pickle
of
Portici
,
in
the
act
of
remark
on
these
uncommon
circumstance
as
quite
beyond
his
experience
,
stumble
,
fall
,
disengage
himself
,
with
quick
presence
of
mind
,
from
those
about
him
,
plunge
away
head
foremost
,
and
roll
,
over
and
over
,
down
the
whole
surface
of
the
cone
!
  
<EOS>
sickening
as
it
be
to
look
,
and
be
so
powerless
to
help
him
<EOS>
,
I
see
him
there
,
in
the
moonlight
---
I
have
have
such
a
dream
often
---
skim
over
the
white
ice
,
like
a
cannon
-
ball
.
 
<EOS>
almost
at
the
same
moment
,
there
be
a
cry
from
behind
;
and
a
man
who
have
carry
a
light
basket
of
spare
cloak
on
his
head
,
come
roll
past
,
at
the
same
frightful
speed
,
closely
follow
by
a
boy
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
climax
of
the
chapter
of
accident
,
the
remain
eight
-
and
-
twenty
vociferate
to
that
degree
,
that
a
pack
of
wolf
would
be
music
to
them
!
  
<EOS>
Giddy
,
and
bloody
,
and
a
mere
bundle
of
rag
,
be
Pickle
of
Portici
when
we
reach
the
place
where
we
dismount
,
and
where
the
horse
be
wait
;
but
,
thank
God
,
sound
in
limb
!
 
<EOS>
and
never
be
we
likely
to
be
more
glad
to
see
a
man
alive
and
on
his
foot
,
than
to
see
him
now
---
make
light
of
it
too
,
though
sorely
bruise
and
in
great
pain
.
 
<EOS>
the
boy
be
bring
into
the
hermitage
on
the
Mountain
,
while
we
be
at
supper
,
with
his
head
tie
up
;
and
the
man
be
hear
of
,
some
hour
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
He
too
be
bruise
and
stunned
,
but
have
break
no
bone
;
the
snow
have
,
fortunately
,
cover
all
the
large
block
of
rock
and
stone
,
and
render
them
harmless
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
cheerful
meal
,
and
a
good
rest
before
a
blaze
fire
,
we
again
take
horse
,
and
continue
our
descent
to
Salvatore
's
house
---
very
slowly
,
by
reason
of
our
bruise
friend
be
hardly
able
to
keep
the
saddle
,
or
endure
the
pain
of
motion
.
 
<EOS>
though
it
be
so
late
at
night
,
or
early
in
the
morning
,
all
the
people
of
the
village
be
wait
about
the
little
stable
-
yard
when
we
arrive
,
and
look
up
the
road
by
which
we
be
expect
.
 
<EOS>
Our
appearance
be
hail
with
a
great
clamour
of
tongue
,
and
a
general
sensation
for
which
in
our
modesty
we
be
somewhat
at
a
loss
to
account
,
until
,
turn
into
the
yard
,
we
find
that
one
of
a
party
of
french
gentleman
who
be
on
the
mountain
at
the
same
time
be
lie
on
some
straw
in
the
stable
,
with
a
broken
limb
:
 
look
like
death
,
and
suffer
great
torture
;
and
that
we
be
confidently
suppose
to
have
encounter
some
bad
accident
.
  
<EOS>
so
"
well
return
,
and
Heaven
be
praise
!
"
<EOS>
as
the
cheerful
Vetturino
,
who
have
bear
us
company
all
the
way
from
Pisa
,
say
,
with
all
his
heart
!
 
<EOS>
and
away
with
his
ready
horse
,
into
sleep
Naples
!
  
<EOS>
It
wake
again
to
Policinelli
and
pickpocket
,
buffo
singer
and
beggar
,
rag
,
puppet
,
flower
,
brightness
,
dirt
,
and
universal
degradation
;
air
its
Harlequin
suit
in
the
sunshine
,
next
day
and
every
day
;
singing
,
starve
,
dance
,
gaming
,
on
the
sea

shore
;
and
leave
all
labour
to
the
burn
mountain
,
which
be
ever
at
its
work
.
  
<EOS>
Our
english
dilettanti
would
be
very
pathetic
on
the
subject
of
the
national
taste
,
if
they
could
hear
an
italian
opera
half
as
badly
sing
in
England
as
we
may
hear
the
Foscari
perform
,
to
-
night
,
in
the
splendid
theatre
of
San
Carlo
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
for
astonishing
truth
and
spirit
in
seize
and
embody
the
real
life
about
it
,
the
shabby
little
San
Carlino
Theatre
---
the
rickety
house
one
story
high
,
with
a
stare
picture
outside
:
 
down
among
the
drum
and
trumpet
,
and
the
tumbler
,
and
the
lady
conjurer
---
be
without
a
rival
anywhere
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
one
extraordinary
feature
in
the
real
life
of
Naples
,
at
which
we
may
take
a
glance
before
we
go
---
the
Lotteries
.
  
<EOS>
They
prevail
in
most
part
of
Italy
,
but
be
particularly
obvious
,
in
their
effect
and
influence
,
here
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
draw
every
Saturday
.
 
<EOS>
They
bring
an
immense
revenue
to
the
Government
;
and
diffuse
a
taste
for
gambling
among
the
poor
of
the
poor
,
which
be
very
comfortable
to
the
coffer
of
the
State
,
and
very
ruinous
to
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
the
low
stake
be
one
grain
;
less
than
a
farthing
.
 
<EOS>
one
hundred

---
from

inclusive
---
be
put
into

<EOS>
five

<EOS>
those
be

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
if
one

up

I

<EOS>
if

<EOS>
I

(
or

it

what
I
can

my

and
buy
what
number
I

<EOS>
the
amount

I
pay
at

every

an
Universal
Lottery
Diviner
,
where
every
possible
accident
and
circumstance
be
provide
for
,
and
have
a
number
against
it

<EOS>
for
instance
,
let
us
take
two
carlini
---
about
sevenpence
.
 
<EOS>
on
our
way
to
the
lottery
office
,
we
run
against
a
black
man
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
get
there
,
we
say
gravely
,
"
the
Diviner
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
hand
over
the
counter
,
as
a
serious
matter
of
business

<EOS>
We
look
at
black
man
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
number
.
 
<EOS>
"
give

<EOS>
"
We
look
at
run
against
a

<EOS>
"
give

<EOS>
"
We
look
at
the

the
street
itself
.
 
<EOS>
"
give
us
that

"
 
<EOS>
now
,
we
have
our
three
number
.
  
<EOS>
if
the
roof
of
the
theatre
of
San
Carlo
be
to
fall
in
,
so
many
people
would
play
upon
the
number
attach
to
such
an
accident
in
the
Diviner
,
that
the
Government
would
soon
close
those
number
,
and
decline
to
run
the
risk
of
lose
any
more
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
this
often
happen
.
 
<EOS>
not
long
ago
,
when
there
be
a
fire
in
the
King

Palace

there
be
such
a
desperate
run
on

that
further
stake

<EOS>
every

by
the
ignorant

to
be
a
revelation
to
the

<EOS>
certain

be
much

and
there
be
some
priest
who
be
constantly

<EOS>
I
hear
of
a
horse

him
down

dead

He
throw
himself
upon

clasp
his

mention
your

<EOS>
It
be
four
o'clock
in

necessary
number
of
judge
;
during
which
,
the
box
,
in
which
the
number
be
be
place
,
be
a
source
of
the
deep
interest
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
box
be
full
,
the
boy
who
be
to
draw
the
number
out
of
it
become
the
prominent
feature
of
the
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
already
dress
for
his
part
,
in
a
tight
brown
Holland
coat
,
with
only
one
(
the
left
)
sleeve
to
it
,
which
leave
his
right
arm
bare
to
the
shoulder
,
ready
for
plunge
down
into
the
mysterious
chest
.
  
<EOS>
during
the
hush
and
whisper
that
pervade
the
room
,
all
eye
be
turn
on
this
young
minister
of
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
People
begin
to
inquire
his
age
,
with
a
view
to
the
next
lottery
;
and
the
number
of
his
brother
and
sister
;
and
the
age
of
his
father
and
mother
;
and
whether
he
have
any
mole
or
pimple
upon
him
;
and
where
,
and
how
many
;
when
the
arrival
of
the
last
judge
but
one
(
a
little
old
man
,
universally
dread
as
possess
the
Evil
Eye
)
make
a
slight
diversion
,
and
would
occasion
a
great
one
,
but
that
he
be
immediately
depose
,
as
a
source
of
interest
,
by
the
officiating
priest
,
who
advance
gravely
to
his
place
,
follow
by
a
very
dirty
little
boy
,
carry
his
sacred
vestment
,
and
a
pot
of
Holy
Water
.
  
<EOS>
here
be
the
last
judge
come
at
last
,
and
now
he
take
his
place
at
the
horse
-
shoe
table
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
murmur
of
irrepressible
agitation
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
it
,
the
priest
put
his
head
into
the
sacred
vestment
,
and
pull
the
same
over
his
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
say
a
silent
prayer
;
and
dip
a
brush
into
the
pot
of
Holy
Water
,
sprinkle
it
over
the
box
---
and
over
the
boy
,
and
give
them
a
double
-
barrel
blessing
,
which
the
box
and
the
boy
be
both
hoist
on
the
table
to
receive
.
 
<EOS>
the
boy
remain
on
the
table
,
the
box
be
now
carry
round
the
front
of
the
platform
,
by
an
attendant
,
who
hold
it
up
and
shake
it
lustily
all
the
time
;
seem
to
say
,
like
the
conjurer
,
"
there
be
no
deception
,
lady
and
gentleman
;
keep
your
eye
upon
me
,
if
you
please
!
"
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
the
box
be
set
before
the
boy
;
and
the
boy
,
first
hold
up
his
naked
arm
and
open
hand
,
dive
down
into
the
hole
(
it
be
make
like
a
ballot
-
box
)
and
pull
out
a
number
,
which
be
roll
up
,
round
something
hard
,
like
a
bonbon
.
 
<EOS>
this
he
hand
to
the
judge
next
him
,
who
unroll
a
little
bit
,
and
hand
it
to
the
President
,
next
to
whom
he
sit
.
 
<EOS>
the
President
unroll
it
,
very
slowly
.
 
<EOS>
the
Capo
Lazzarone
lean
over
his
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
the
President
hold
it
up
,
unrolled
,
to
the
Capo
Lazzarone
.
 
<EOS>
the
Capo
Lazzarone
,
look
at
it
eagerly
,
cry
out
,
in
a
shrill
,
loud
voice
,
"
sessantadue
!
"
<EOS>
(
sixty
-
two
)
,
express
the
two
upon
his
finger
,
as
he
call
it
out
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
the
Capo
Lazzarone
himself
have
not
stake
on
sixty
-
two
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
be
very
long
,
and
his
eye
roll
wildly
.
  
<EOS>
as
it
happen
to
be
a
favourite
number
,
however
,
it
be
pretty
well
receive
,
which
be
not
always
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
all
draw
with
the
same
ceremony
,
omit
the
blessing
.
 
<EOS>
one
blessing
be
enough
for
the
whole
multiplication
-
table
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
new
incident
in
the
proceeding
,
be
the
gradually
deepen
intensity
of
the
change
in
the
Cape
Lazzarone
,
who
have
,
evidently
,
speculate
to
the
very
utmost
extent
of
his
mean
;
and
who
,
when
he
see
the
last
number
,
and
find
that
it
be
not
one
of
his
,
clasp
his
hand
,
and
raise
his
eye
to
the
ceiling
before
proclaim
it
,
as
though
remonstrate
,
in
a
secret
agony
,
with
his
patron
saint
,
for
have
commit
so
gross
a
breach
of
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
the
Capo
Lazzarone
may
not
desert
him
for
some
other
member
of
the
Calendar
,
but
he
seem
to
threaten
it
.
  
<EOS>
where
the
winner
may
be
,
nobody
know
.
 
<EOS>
They
certainly
be
not
present
;
the
general
disappointment
fill
one
with
pity
for
the
poor
people
.
 
<EOS>
They
look
:
 
when
we
stand
aside
,
observe
them
,
in
their
passage
through
the
court
-
yard
down
below
:
 
as
miserable
as
the
prisoner
in
the
gaol
(
it
form
a
part
of
the
building
)
,
who
be
peep
down
upon
them
,
from
between
their
bar
;
or
,
as
the
fragment
of
human
head
which
be
still
dangle
in
chain
outside

in
memory
of
the
good
old

when
their

for
the
popular
edification

<EOS>
away
from
Naples
in

glorious

by

Capua

and
then
on
a
three

journey
along

that
we
may
see
,
on

,
the

lofty

above
the

of
San
Germano

and
be

on
a
misty
morning
in

<EOS>
so
much
the
well

for
the
deep
sounding
of
its
bell

which
,
as
we
go

up

on

towards

be

mysteriously
in

,
while
nothing

<EOS>
the
grey
mist
,
move
solemnly

slowly
,
like

funeral
procession

<EOS>
Behold
,
at
length
the
shadowy
pile
of
building
close
before
us
:
 
<EOS>
its
grey
wall
and
tower
dimly
see
,
though
so
near
and
so
vast
:
 
and
the
raw
vapour
roll
through
its
cloister
heavily
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
two
black

near

of

Patron
Saint

and
hop
on
behind
them
,
in

out

the
old
arch

be
a
raven
,
croak
in
answer
to
the
bell
,
and
uttering
,
at
interval
,
the
pure
Tuscan

<EOS>
how

<EOS>
there

stealthy

at

what

"
He

<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
expressive
than
his
reception
of
the
peasant
who
be
enter
the
gate
with
basket
and
burden
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
roll
in
his
eye
,
and
a
chuckle
in
his
throat
,
which
should
qualify
him
to
be

Superior

He

Glad

"
<EOS>
how

a

the

<EOS>
"
Caw

<EOS>
these

(
as

be
densely

"
<EOS>
Caw

"
say

<EOS>
so
we
leave
him
,
chuckle
and
roll
his
eye
at
the
convent
gate
,
and
wind
slowly
down
again
through
the
cloud

<EOS>
at
last
emerge
from

we

in

which
be
pleasant

no

<EOS>
away
we
go
again
,
by
muddy
road

and
through
the
most
shattered
and
tattere
of
village
,
where
there
be
not
a
whole

the

the

anything

<EOS>
the

rapacious

<EOS>
the
inn
be
such
hobgoblin

that
they

infinitely
more

here

there

the

there

and
the
washing
apparatus
be
identical

<EOS>
but
the
yellow

set
on
the
table
a
good
flask

excellent
