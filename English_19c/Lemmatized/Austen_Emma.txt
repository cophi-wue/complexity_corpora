Emma
Woodhouse
,
handsome
,
clever
,
and
rich
,
with
a
comfortable
home
and
happy
disposition
,
seem
to
unite
some
of
the
good
blessing
of
existence
;
and
have
live
nearly
twenty
-
one
year
in
the
world
with
very
little
to
distress
or
vex
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
the
young
of
the
two
daughter
of
a
most
affectionate
,
indulgent
father
;
and
have
,
in
consequence
of
her
sister
's
marriage
,
be
mistress
of
his
house
from
a
very
early
period
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
have
die
too
long
ago
for
her
to
have
more
than
an
indistinct
remembrance
of
her
caress
;
and
her
place
have
be
supply
by
an
excellent
woman
as
governess
,
who
have
fall
little
short
of
a
mother
in
affection
.
  
<EOS>
sixteen
year
have
Miss
Taylor
be
in
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
family
,
less
as
a
governess
than
a
friend
,
very
fond
of
both
daughter
,
but
particularly
of
Emma
.
<EOS>
between
_
them
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
it
be
more
the
intimacy
of
sister
.
<EOS>
even
before
Miss
Taylor
have
cease
to
hold
the
nominal
office
of
governess
,
the
mildness
of
her
temper
have
hardly
allow
her
to
impose
any
restraint
;
and
the
shadow
of
authority
be
now
long
pass
away
,
they
have
be
live
together
as
friend
and
friend
very
mutually
attach
,
and
Emma
do
just
what
she
like
;
highly
esteem
Miss
Taylor
's
judgment
,
but
direct
chiefly
by
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
the
real
evil
,
indeed
,
of
Emma
's
situation
be
the
power
of
have
rather
too
much
her
own
way
,
and
a
disposition
to
think
a
little
too
well
of
herself
;
these
be
the
disadvantage
which
threaten
alloy
to
her
many
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
the
danger
,
however
,
be
at
present
so
unperceived
,
that
they
do
not
by
any
mean
rank
as
misfortune
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
sorrow
come
 
a
gentle
sorrow
 
but
not
at
all
in
the
shape
of
any
disagreeable
consciousness
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Taylor
marry
.
<EOS>
It
be
Miss
Taylor
's
loss
which
first
bring
grief
.
<EOS>
It
be
on
the
wedding
-
day
of
this
beloved
friend
that
Emma
first
sit
in
mournful
thought
of
any
continuance
.
<EOS>
the
wedding
over
,
and
the
bride
-
people
go
,
her
father
and
herself
be
leave
to
dine
together
,
with
no
prospect
of
a
third
to
cheer
a
long
evening
.
<EOS>
Her
father
compose
himself
to
sleep
after
dinner
,
as
usual
,
and
she
have
then
only
to
sit
and
think
of
what
she
have
lose
.
  
<EOS>
the
event
have
every
promise
of
happiness
for
her
friend
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
be
a
man
of
unexceptionable
character
,
easy
fortune
,
suitable
age
,
and
pleasant
manner
;
and
there
be
some
satisfaction
in
consider
with
what
self
-
deny
,
generous
friendship
she
have
always
wish
and
promote
the
match
;
but
it
be
a
black
morning
's
work
for
her
.
<EOS>
the
want
of
Miss
Taylor
would
be
feel
every
hour
of
every
day
.
<EOS>
She
recall
her
past
kindness
 
<EOS>
the
kindness
,
the
affection
of
sixteen
year
 
how
she
have
teach
and
how
she
have
play
with
her
from
five
year
old
 
how
she
have
devote
all
her
power
to
attach
and
amuse
her
in
health
 
and
how
nurse
her
through
the
various
illness
of
childhood
.
<EOS>
a
large
debt
of
gratitude
be
owe
here
;
but
the
intercourse
of
the
last
seven
year
,
the
equal
footing
and
perfect
unreserve
which
have
soon
follow
Isabella
's
marriage
,
on
their
be
leave
to
each
other
,
be
yet
a
dearer
,
tenderer
recollection
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
a
friend
and
companion
such
as
few
possess
:
intelligent
,
well
-
inform
,
useful
,
gentle
,
know
all
the
way
of
the
family
,
interested
in
all
its
concern
,
and
peculiarly
interested
in
herself
,
in
every
pleasure
,
every
scheme
of
hers
 
one
to
whom
she
could
speak
every
thought
as
it
arise
,
and
who
have
such
an
affection
for
her
as
could
never
find
fault
.
  
<EOS>
how
be
she
to
bear
the
change
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
her
friend
be
go
only
half
a
mile
from
them
;
but
Emma
be
aware
that
great
must
be
the
difference
between
a
Mrs.
Weston
,
only
half
a
mile
from
them
,
and
a
Miss
Taylor
in
the
house
;
and
with
all
her
advantage
,
natural
and
domestic
,
she
be
now
in
great
danger
of
suffer
from
intellectual
solitude
.
<EOS>
She
dearly
love
her
father
,
but
he
be
no
companion
for
her
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
meet
her
in
conversation
,
rational
or
playful
.
  
<EOS>
the
evil
of
the
actual
disparity
in
their
age
(
and
Mr.
Woodhouse
have
not
marry
early
)
be
much
increase
by
his
constitution
and
habit
;
for
have
be
a
valetudinarian
all
his
life
,
without
activity
of
mind
or
body
,
he
be
a
much
old
man
in
way
than
in
year
;
and
though
everywhere
beloved
for
the
friendliness
of
his
heart
and
his
amiable
temper
,
his
talent
could
not
have
recommend
him
at
any
time
.
  
<EOS>
Her
sister
,
though
comparatively
but
little
remove
by
matrimony
,
be
settle
in
London
,
only
sixteen
mile
off
,
be
much
beyond
her
daily
reach
;
and
many
a
long
October
and
November
evening
must
be
struggle
through
at
Hartfield
,
before
Christmas
bring
the
next
visit
from
Isabella
and
her
husband
,
and
their
little
child
,
to
fill
the
house
,
and
give
her
pleasant
society
again
.
  
<EOS>
Highbury
,
the
large
and
populous
village
,
almost
amount
to
a
town
,
to
which
Hartfield
,
in
spite
of
its
separate
lawn
,
and
shrubbery
,
and
name
,
do
really
belong
,
afford
her
no
equal
.
<EOS>
the
Woodhouses
be
first
in
consequence
there
.
<EOS>
all
look
up
to
them
.
<EOS>
She
have
many
acquaintance
in
the
place
,
for
her
father
be
universally
civil
,
but
not
one
among
them
who
could
be
accept
in
lieu
of
Miss
Taylor
for
even
half
a
day
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
melancholy
change
;
and
Emma
could
not
but
sigh
over
it
,
and
wish
for
impossible
thing
,
till
her
father
awake
,
and
make
it
necessary
to
be
cheerful
.
<EOS>
His
spirit
require
support
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
nervous
man
,
easily
depressed
;
fond
of
every
body
that
he
be
use
to
,
and
hate
to
part
with
them
;
hate
change
of
every
kind
.
<EOS>
Matrimony
,
as
the
origin
of
change
,
be
always
disagreeable
;
and
he
be
by
no
means
yet
reconcile
to
his
own
daughter
's
marrying
,
nor
could
ever
speak
of
her
but
with
compassion
,
though
it
have
be
entirely
a
match
of
affection
,
when
he
be
now
oblige
to
part
with
Miss
Taylor
too
;
and
from
his
habit
of
gentle
selfishness
,
and
of
be
never
able
to
suppose
that
other
people
could
feel
differently
from
himself
,
he
be
very
much
disposed
to
think
Miss
Taylor
have
do
as
sad
a
thing
for
herself
as
for
them
,
and
would
have
be
a
great
deal
happy
if
she
have
spend
all
the
rest
of
her
life
at
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
Emma
smile
and
chat
as
cheerfully
as
she
could
,
to
keep
him
from
such
thought
;
but
when
tea
come
,
it
be
impossible
for
him
not
to
say
exactly
as
he
have
say
at
dinner
,
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Miss
Taylor
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
she

it

that
Mr.

I

be
such
a
good

humoured

pleasant

excellent

that
he
thoroughly

and
you
would
not
have
have
Miss
Taylor
live
with
us
for
ever

bear
all
my
odd
humour
,
when

a

<EOS>

a

where

the
advantage
of
a

this

three
time

we
have
settle
all
that
already

<EOS>
We
talk
it
all
over
with
Mr.
Weston
last
night
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
James
,
you
may
be
very
sure
he
will
always
like
go
to
randall
,
because
of
his
daughter
's
be
housemaid
there

<EOS>
I
only
doubt
whether
he
will
ever
take
us
anywhere
else

<EOS>
that
be
your
doing

<EOS>
You
get
Hannah
that
good

<EOS>
nobody

Hannah

you

her
 
<EOS>
James
be
so
obliged
to
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
I
do
think
of
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
lucky
,
for
I
would
not
have
have
poor
James
think
himself
slight
upon
any
account
;
and
I
be
sure
she
will
make
a
very
good
servant
<EOS>
:
she
be
a
civil
,
pretty
-
spoken
girl
;
I
have
a
great
opinion
of
her
.
<EOS>
whenever
I
see
her
,
she
always
curtsey
and
ask
me
how
I
do
,
in
a
very
pretty
manner
;
and
when
you
have
have
her
here
to
do
needlework
,
I
observe
she
always
turn
the
lock
of
the
door
the
right
way
and
never
bang
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
she
will
be
an
excellent
servant
;
and
it
will
be
a
great
comfort
to
poor
Miss
Taylor
to
have
somebody
about
her
that
she
be
use
to
see
.
<EOS>
whenever
James
go
over
to
see
his
daughter
,
you
know
,
she
will
be
hear
of
us

<EOS>
He
will
be
able
to
tell
her
how
we

more

He

some
day

absence

now
walk
up
to
Hartfield

well
in
Brunswick
Square

though
this

she

it

We

say
it
again

some
scruple

some
reluctance
the
widower

father
may
be
suppose

feel

as

overcome
by
other
consideration

the

be
give
up

He
quit
the

engage
in
trade
,
have
brother
already
establish
in
a
good
way
in
London
,
which
afford
him
a
favourable
opening
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
concern
which
bring
just
employment
enough
.
<EOS>
He
have
still
a
small
house
in
Highbury
,
where
most
of
his
leisure
day
be
spend
;
and
between
useful
occupation
and
the
pleasure
of
society
,
the
next
eighteen
or
twenty
year
of
his
life
pass
cheerfully
away
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
by
that
time
,
realise
an
easy
competence
 
enough
to
secure
the
purchase
of
a
little
estate
adjoin
Highbury
,
which
he
have
always
long
for
 
enough
to
marry
a
woman
as
portionless
even
as
Miss
Taylor
,
and
to
live
accord
to
the
wish
of
his
own
friendly
and
social
disposition

<EOS>
It
be
now
some
time
since
Miss
Taylor
have
begin
to
influence
his
scheme
;
but
as
it
be
not
the
tyrannic
influence
of
youth
on
youth
,
it
have
not
shake
his
determination
of
never
settle
till
he
could
purchase
Randalls
,
and
the
sale
of
randall
be
long
look
forward
to
;
but
he
have
go
steadily
on

with
these
object
in
view
,
till
they
be
accomplish

<EOS>
He
have
make
his
fortune
,
buy
his
house
,

obtain
his

be
begin
a
new
period
of
existence

with
every
probability
of
great
happiness
than
in
any
yet
pass
through

<EOS>
He
have
never
be
an
unhappy
man
;
his
own
temper
have
secure
him
from
that
,
even
in
his
first
marriage
;
but
his
second
must
shew
him
how
delightful
a
well
-
judging
and
truly
amiable
woman
could
be
,
and
must
give
him
the
pleasantest
proof
of
its
be
a
great
deal
better
to
choose
than
to
be
choose
,
to
excite
gratitude
than
to
feel
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
only
himself
to
please
in
his
choice
:
his
fortune
be
his
own
;
for
as
to
Frank
,
it
be
more
than
be
tacitly
bring
up
as
his
uncle

heir

it
have
become
so
avow
an
adoption
as
to
have
him
assume
the
name
of
Churchill
on
come
of
age

<EOS>
It
be
most
unlikely
,
therefore
,
that
he
should
ever
want
his
father
's
assistance

father
have
no
apprehension
of
it

the
aunt
be

capricious
woman
,
and
govern
her
husband
entirely
;
but
it
be
not
in
Mr.
Weston
's
nature
to
imagine
that
any
caprice
could
be
strong
enough
to
affect
one
so
dear
,
and
,
as
he
believe
,
so
deservedly
dear
.
<EOS>
He
see
his
son
every
year
in
London
,
and
be
proud
of
him
;
and
his
fond
report
of
him
as
a
very
fine
young
man
have
make
Highbury
feel
a
sort
of
pride
in
him
too
.
<EOS>
He
be
look
on
as
sufficiently
belong
to
the
place
to
make
his
merit
and
prospect
a
kind
of
common
concern
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
be
one
of
the
boast
of
Highbury
,
and
a
lively
curiosity
to
see
him
prevail
,
though
the
compliment
be
so
little
return
that
he
have
never
be
there
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
His
come
to
visit
his
father
have
be
often
talk
of
but
never
achieve
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
upon
his
father
's
marriage
,
it
be
very
generally
propose
,
as
a
most
proper
attention
,
that
the
visit
should
take
place
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
dissentient
voice
on
the
subject
,
either
when
Mrs.
Perry
drink
tea
with
Mrs.
and
Miss
Bates
,
or
when
Mrs.
and
Miss
Bates
return
the
visit
.
<EOS>
now
be
the
time
for
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
to
come
among
them
;
and
the
hope
strengthen
when
it
be
understand
that
he
have
write
to
his
new
mother
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
for
a
few
day
,
every
morning
visit
in
Highbury
include
some
mention
of
the
handsome
letter
Mrs.
Weston
have
receive
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
have
hear
of
the
handsome
letter
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
have
write
to
Mrs.
Weston
?
<EOS>
I
understand
it
be
a
very
handsome
letter
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
tell
me
of
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
see
the
letter
,
and
he
say
he
never
see
such
a
handsome
letter
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
,
indeed
,
a
highly
prize
letter
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
have
,
of
course
,
form
a
very
favourable
idea
of
the
young
man
;
and
such
a
pleasing
attention
be
an
irresistible
proof
of
his
great
good
sense
,
and
a
most
welcome
addition
to
every
source
and
every
expression
of
congratulation
which
her
marriage
have
already
secure
.
<EOS>
She
feel
herself
a
most
fortunate
woman
;
and
she
have
live
long
enough
to
know
how
fortunate
she
may
well
be
think
,
where
the
only
regret
be
for
a
partial
separation
from
friend
whose
friendship
for
her
have
never
cool
,
and
who
could
ill
bear
to
part
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
know
that
at
time
she
must
be
miss
;
and
could
not
think
,
without
pain
,
of
Emma
's
lose
a
single
pleasure
,
or
suffer
an
hour
's
ennui
,
from
the
want
of
her
companionableness
:
<EOS>
but
dear
Emma
be
of
no
feeble
character
;
she
be
more
equal
to
her
situation
than
most
girl
would
have
be
,
and
have
sense
,
and
energy
,
and
spirit
that
may
be
hope
would
bear
her
well
and
happily
through
its
little
difficulty
and
privation
.
<EOS>
and
then
there
be
such
comfort
in
the
very
easy
distance
of
randall
from
Hartfield
,
so
convenient
for
even
solitary
female
walking
,
and
in
Mr.
Weston
's
disposition
and
circumstance
,
which
would
make
the
approach
season
no
hindrance
to
their
spending
half
the
evening
in
the
week
together
.
  
<EOS>
Her
situation
be
altogether
the
subject
of
hour
of
gratitude
to
Mrs.
Weston
,
and
of
moment
only
of
regret
;
and
her
satisfaction
 
her
more
than
satisfaction
 
her
cheerful
enjoyment
,
be
so
just
and
so
apparent
,
<EOS>
that
Emma
,
well
as
she
know
her
father
,
be
sometimes
take
by
surprize
at
his
be
still
able
to
pity
"
poor
Miss
Taylor
,
"
when
they
leave
her
at
randall
in
the
centre
of
every
domestic
comfort
,
or
see
her
go
away
in
the
evening
attend
by
her
pleasant
husband
to
a
carriage
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
but
never
do
she
go
without
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
give
a
gentle
sigh
,
and
say
,
"
ah
,
poor
Miss
Taylor
!
<EOS>
She
would
be
very
glad
to
stay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
recover
Miss
Taylor
 
nor
much
likelihood
of
cease
to
pity
her
;
but
a
few
week
bring
some
alleviation
to
Mr.
Woodhouse
.
<EOS>
the
compliment
of
his
neighbour
be
over
;
he
be
no
longer
tease
by
be
wish
joy
of
so
sorrowful
an
event
;
and
the
wedding
-
cake
,
which
have
be
a
great
distress
to
him
,
be
all
eat
up
.
<EOS>
His
own
stomach
could
bear
nothing
rich
,
and
he
could
never
believe
other
people
to
be
different
from
himself
.
<EOS>
what
be
unwholesome
to
him
he
regard
as
unfit
for
any
body
;
and
he
have
,
therefore
,
earnestly
try
to
dissuade
them
from
have
any
wedding
-
cake
at
all
,
and
when
that
prove
vain
,
as
earnestly
try
to
prevent
any
body
's
eat
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
at
the
pain
of
consult
Mr.
Perry
,
the
apothecary
,
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Perry
be
an
intelligent
,
gentlemanlike
man
,
whose
frequent
visit
be
one
of
the
comfort
of
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
life
;
and
upon
be
apply
to
,
he
could
not
but
acknowledge
(
though
it
seem
rather
against
the
bias
of
inclination
)
that
wedding
-
cake
may
certainly
disagree
with
many
 
perhaps
with
most
people
,
unless
take
moderately
.
<EOS>
with
such
an
opinion
,
in
confirmation
of
his
own
,
Mr.
Woodhouse
hope
to
influence
every
visitor
of
the
newly
married
pair
;
but
still
the
cake
be
eat
;
and
there
be
no
rest
for
his
benevolent
nerve
till
it
be
all
go
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
strange
rumour
in
Highbury
of
all
the
little
Perrys
be
see
with
a
slice
of
Mrs.
Weston
's
wedding
-
cake
in
their
hand
:
but
Mr.
Woodhouse
would
never
believe
it
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
be
fond
of
society
in
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
He
like
very
much
to
have
his
friend
come
and
see
him
;
and
from
various
united
cause
,
from
his
long
residence
at
Hartfield
,
and
his
good
nature
,
from
his
fortune
,
his
house
,
and
his
daughter
,
he
could
command
the
visit
of
his
own
little
circle
,
in
a
great
measure
,
as
he
like
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
much
intercourse
with
any
family
beyond
that
circle
;
his
horror
of
late
hour
,
and
large
dinner
-
party
,
make
him
unfit
for
any
acquaintance
but
such
as
would
visit
him
on
his
own
term
.
<EOS>
fortunately
for
him
,
Highbury
,
include
randall
in
the
same
parish
,
and
Donwell
Abbey
in
the
parish
adjoin
,
the
seat
of
Mr.
Knightley
,
comprehend
many
such
.
<EOS>
not
unfrequently
,
through
Emma
's
persuasion
,
he
have
some
of
the
choose
and
the
good
to
dine
with
him
:
but
evening
party
be
what
he
prefer
;
and
,
unless
he
fancy
himself
at
any
time
unequal
to
company
,
there
be
scarcely
an
evening
in
the
week
in
which
Emma
could
not
make
up
a
card
-
table
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
real
,
long
-
stand
regard
bring
the
Westons
and
Mr.
Knightley
;
and
by
Mr.
Elton
,
a
young
man
live
alone
without
like
it
,
the
privilege
of
exchange
any
vacant
evening
of
his
own
blank
solitude
for
the
elegancie
and
society
of
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
drawing
-
room
,
and
the
smile
of
his
lovely
daughter
,
be
in
no
danger
of
be

away
.
  
<EOS>
after
these
come
a
second

of
an
invitation
from
Hartfield

and
who

so
often
,
that
Mr.
Woodhouse
think
it
no
hardship
for
either
James
or
the
horse
.
<EOS>
have
it
take
place
only
once
a
year
,
it
would
have
be
a
grievance

She

all
the
regard
and
respect
which
a
harmless
old
lady

under
such
untoward
circumstance

<EOS>
Her
daughter

a
most
uncommon
degree
of
popularity
for
a
woman

<EOS>
Miss

the
very
bad
predicament
in
the
world
for

and
she
have
no
intellectual
superiority
to
make
atonement
to
herself

those
who

hate
her
into
outward
respect

<EOS>
She
have
never

beauty
or
cleverness

Her
youth

and
her
middle

to
the
care
of
a
fail

and
the
endeavour
to
make
a
small
income

as
far
as
possible

<EOS>
and
yet
she
be
a
happy
woman
,
and
a
woman
whom
no
one

She

a
great
talker
upon
little
matter
,
which
exactly

Mr.
Woodhouse

full
of
trivial
communication
and
harmless
gossip

<EOS>
Mrs.

the
mistress
of
a

and
in

.
<EOS>
It
be
no
wonder
that
a
train
of
twenty
young
couple

.
<EOS>
She
be
a
plain

motherly
kind

woman
,
who

her
youth
,
and
now
think

that
every

as
much
pleased
with
her

<EOS>
She
be
not

by
any
thing
remarkably
clever
in
Miss
Smith
's
conversation
,
but
she
find
her
altogether
very
engaging
 
not
inconveniently
shy
,
not
unwilling
to

so
proper
and
become
a
deference
,
seem
so
pleasantly
grateful
for

in
so
superior
a

They

creditably

highly
of

<EOS>
but
they
must
be
coarse

She

detach
her
from
her
bad
acquaintance

and
introduce
her
into
good
society

she
would
form
her
opinion

her
manner

It
would
be
an
interesting

certainly
a

kind
undertaking

highly
become
her

which
always
close
such
party

for
which
she

the

be
all
set
out
and
ready
,
and
move
forwards
to
the
fire

before

with
an
alacrity
beyond

never
indifferent
to
the
credit

every

well

upon
such
occasion
poor

Mr.

sad
warfare

<EOS>
He
love
to
have
the
cloth
lay
,
because
it
have
be
the
fashion
of
his
youth
,
but
his
conviction
of
supper
be
very
unwholesome
make
him
rather
sorry
to
see
any
thing
put
on
it
;
and
while
his
hospitality
would
have
welcome
his
visitor
to
every

his
care
for
their
health
make
him
grieve
that
they

such

all
that
he

with
thorough

approbation

recommend

though
he

constrain
himself

I
would
not

you

<EOS>
Emma
allow
her
father
to
talk

supply
her
visitor
in
a
much
more
satisfactory
style
,
and
on
the
present
evening
have
particular
pleasure
in
send
them
away
happy

<EOS>
the
happiness
of
Miss
Smith
be
quite
equal
to
her
intention

<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
be
so
great
a
personage
in
Highbury
,
that
the
prospect
of
the
introduction
have
give
as
much
panic
as
pleasure

the
humble

grateful
little

go
off
with
highly
gratified
feeling

delight
with
the
affability

which

<EOS>
Harriet
Smith
's
intimacy
at
Hartfield
be
soon
a
settle
thing
.
<EOS>
quick
and
decide
in
her
way
,
Emma
lose
no
time
in
inviting
,
encouraging
,
and
tell
her
to
come
very
often
;
and
as
their
acquaintance
increase
,
so
do
their
satisfaction
in
each
other
.
<EOS>
as
a
walk
companion
,
Emma
have
very
early
foresee
how
useful
she
may
find
her
.
<EOS>
in
that
respect
Mrs.
Weston
's
loss
have
be
important
.
<EOS>
Her
father
never
go
beyond
the
shrubbery
,
where
two
division
of
the
ground
suffice
him
for
his
long
walk
,
or
his
short
,
as
the
year
vary
;
and
since
Mrs.
Weston
's
marriage
her
exercise
have
be
too
much
confine
.
<EOS>
She
have
venture
once
alone
to
randall
,
but
it
be
not
pleasant
;
and
a
Harriet
Smith
,
therefore
,
one
whom
she
could
summon
at
any
time
to
a
walk
,
would
be
a
valuable
addition
to
her
privilege
.
<EOS>
but
in
every
respect
,
as
she
see
more
of
her
,
she
approve
her
,
and
be
confirm
in
all
her
kind
design
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
certainly
be
not
clever
,
but
she
have
a
sweet
,
docile
,
grateful
disposition
,
be
totally
free
from
conceit
,
and
only
desire
to
be
guide
by
any
one
she
look
up
to
.
<EOS>
Her
early
attachment
to
herself
be
very
amiable
;
and
her
inclination
for
good
company
,
and
power
of
appreciate
what
be
elegant
and
clever
,
shew
that
there
be
no
want
of
taste
,
though
strength
of
understanding
must
not
be
expect
.
<EOS>
altogether
she
be
quite
convinced
of
Harriet
Smith
's
be
exactly
the
young
friend
<EOS>
she
want
 
exactly
the
something
which
her
home
require
.
<EOS>
such
a
friend
as
Mrs.
Weston
be
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
two
such
could
never
be
grant
.
<EOS>
two
such
she
do
not
want
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
a
different
sort
of
thing
,
a
sentiment
distinct
and
independent
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
be
the
object
of
a
regard
which
have
its
basis
in
gratitude
and
esteem
.
<EOS>
Harriet
would
be
love
as
one
to
whom
she
could
be
useful
.
<EOS>
for
Mrs.
Weston
there
be
nothing
to
be
do
;
for
Harriet
every
thing
.
  
<EOS>
Her
first
attempt
at
usefulness
be
in
an
endeavour
to
find
out
who
be
the
parent
,
but
Harriet
could
not
tell
.
<EOS>
She
be
ready
to
tell
every
thing
in
her
power
,
but
on
this
subject
question
be
vain
.
<EOS>
Emma
be
oblige
to
fancy
what
she
like
 
<EOS>
but
she
could
never
believe
that
in
the
same
situation
_
she
_
should
not
have
discover
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Harriet
have
no
penetration
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
satisfied
to
hear
and
believe
just
what
Mrs.
Goddard
choose
to
tell
her
;
and
look
no
farther
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Goddard
,
and
the
teacher
,
and
the
girl
and
the
affair
of
the
school
in
general
,
form
naturally
a
great
part
of
the
conversation
 
and
but
for
her
acquaintance
with
the
Martins
of
Abbey
-
Mill
Farm
,
it
must
have
be
the
whole
.
<EOS>
but
the
Martins
occupy
her
thought
a
good
deal
;
she
have
spend
two
very
happy
month
with
them
,
and
now
love
to
talk
of
the
pleasure
of
her
visit
,
and
describe
the
many
comfort
and
wonder
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
Emma
encourage
her
talkativeness
 
amuse
by
such
a
picture
of
another
set
of
being
,
and
enjoy
the
youthful
simplicity
which
could
speak
with
so
much
exultation
of
Mrs.
Martin

parlour

two
very
good
parlour
,
indeed
;
one
of
them
quite
as
large
as
Mrs.
Goddard
's
drawing

room
;
and
of
her
have
an
upper
maid
who
have
live
five

twenty
year
with
her
;
and
of
their
have
eight
cow

two
of
them
Alderneys
,
and
one
a
little
Welch
cow
,
a
very
pretty
little
Welch
cow
indeed
;
and
of
Mrs.
Martin

say
as
she
be
so
fond
of
it
,
it
should
be
call
_
her
_
cow

and
of
their
have
a
very
handsome
summer

house
in
their
garden
,
where
some
day
next
year
they
be
all
to
drink
tea
:
 
a
very
handsome
summer
-
house
,
large
enough
to
hold
a
dozen
people
.
"
  
<EOS>
for
some
time
she
be
amuse
,
without
think
beyond
the
immediate
cause
;
but
as
she
come
to
understand
the
family
better
,
other
feeling
arise
.
<EOS>
She
have
take
up
a
wrong
idea
,
fancy
it
be
a
mother
and
daughter
,
a
son
and
son
's
wife
,
who
all
live
together
;
but
when
it
appear
that
the
Mr.
Martin
,
who
bear
a
part
in
the
narrative
,
and
be
always
mention
with
approbation
for
his
great
good
-
nature
in
do
something
or
other
,
be
a
single
man
;
that
there
be
no
young
Mrs.
Martin
,
no
wife
in
the
case
;
she
do
suspect
danger
to
her
poor
little
friend
from
all
this
hospitality
and
kindness
,
and
that
,
if
she
be
not
take
care
of
,
she
may
be
require
to
sink
herself
forever
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
inspirit
notion
,
her
question
increase
in
number
and
meaning
;
and
she
particularly
lead
Harriet
to
talk
more
of
Mr.
Martin
,
and
there
be
evidently
no
dislike
to
it
.
<EOS>
Harriet
be
very
ready
to
speak
of
the
share
he
have
have
in
their
moonlight
walk
and
merry
evening
game
;
and
dwelt
a
good
deal
upon
his
be
so
very
good
-
humoured
and
obliging
.
<EOS>
He
have
go
three
mile
round
one
day
in
order
to
bring
her
some
walnut
,
because
she
have
say
how
fond
she
be
of
them
,
and
in
every
thing
else
he
be
so
very
obliging
.
<EOS>
He
have
his
shepherd
's
son
into
the
parlour
one
night
on
purpose
to
sing
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
fond
of
singe
.
<EOS>
He
could
sing
a
little
himself
.
<EOS>
She
believe
he
be
very
clever
,
and
understand
every
thing
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
very
fine
flock
,
and
,
while
she
be
with
them
,
he
have
be
bid
more
for
his
wool
than
any
body
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
She
believe
every
body
speak
well
of
him
.
<EOS>
His
mother
and
sister
be
very
fond
of
him
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Martin
have
tell
her
one
day
(
and
there
be
a
blush
as
she
say
it
,
)
<EOS>
that
it
be
impossible
for
any
body
to
be
a
well
son
,
and
therefore
she
be
sure
,
whenever
he
marry
,
he
would
make
a
good
husband
.
<EOS>
not
that
she
_
want
_
him
to
marry
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
no
hurry
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
do
,
Mrs.
Martin
!
"
think
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
you
be
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
when
she
have
come
away
,
Mrs.
Martin
be
so
very
kind
as
to
send
Mrs.
Goddard
a
beautiful
goose
 
<EOS>
the
fine
goose
Mrs.
Goddard
have
ever
see
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Goddard
have
dress
it
on
a
Sunday
,
and
ask
all
the
three
teacher
,
Miss
Nash
,
and
Miss
Prince
,
and
Miss
Richardson
,
to
sup
with
her
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Martin
,
I
suppose
,
be
not
a
man
of
information
beyond
the
line
of
his
own
business
?
<EOS>
He
do
not
read
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
!
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
no
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
 
<EOS>
but
I
believe
he
have
read
a
good
deal
 
but
not
what
you
would
think
any
thing
of
.
<EOS>
He
read
the
Agricultural
Reports
,
and
some
other
book
that
lie
in
one
of
the
window
seat
 
<EOS>
but
he
read
all
_
them
_
to
himself
.
<EOS>
but
sometimes
of
an
evening
,
before
we
go
to
card
,
he
would
read
something
aloud
out
of
the
Elegant
Extracts
,
very
entertaining
.
<EOS>
and
I
know
he
have
read
the
Vicar
of
Wakefield
.
<EOS>
He
never
read
the
romance
of
the
Forest
,
nor
the
Children
of
the
Abbey
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
hear
of
such
book
before
I
mention
them
,
but
he
be
determined
to
get
them
now
as
soon
as
ever
he
can
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
next
question
be
    
"
what
sort
of
looking
man
be
Mr.
Martin
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
not
handsome
 
not
at
all
handsome
.
<EOS>
I
think
him
very
plain
at
first
,
but
I
do
not
think
him
so
plain
now
.
<EOS>
one
do
not
,
you
know
,
after
a
time
.
<EOS>
but
do
you
never
see
him
?
<EOS>
He
be
in
Highbury
every
now
and
then
,
and
he
be
sure
to
ride
through
every
week
in
his
way
to
Kingston
.
<EOS>
He
have
pass
you
very
often
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
may
be
,
and
I
may
have
see
him
fifty
time
,
but
without
have
any
idea
of
his
name
.
<EOS>
a
young
farmer
,
whether
on
horseback
or
on
foot
,
be
the
very
last
sort
of
person
to
raise
my
curiosity
.
<EOS>
the
yeomanry
be
precisely
the
order
of
people
with
whom
I
feel
I
can
have
nothing
to
do
.
<EOS>
a
degree
or
two
low
,
and
a
creditable
appearance
may
interest
me
;
I
may
hope
to
be
useful
to
their
family
in
some
way
or
other
.
<EOS>
but
a
farmer
can
need
none
of
my
help
,
and
be
,
therefore
,
in
one
sense
,
as
much
above
my
notice
as
in
every
other
he
be
below
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
oh
yes
!
<EOS>
It
be
not
likely
you
should
ever
have
observe
him
;
but
he
know
you
very
well
indeed
 
<EOS>
I
mean
by
sight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
of
his
be
a
very
respectable
young
man
.
<EOS>
I
know
,
indeed
,
that
he
be
so
,
and
,
as
such
,
wish
him
well
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
imagine
his
age
to
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
four
-
and
-
twenty
the
8th
of
last
June
,
and
my
birthday
be
the
23rd
just
a
fortnight
and
a
day
's
difference
 
which
be
very
odd
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
only
four
-
and
-
twenty

<EOS>
that
be
too
young
to
settle
.
<EOS>
His
mother
be
perfectly
right
not
to
be
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
They
seem
very
comfortable
as
they
be
,
and
if
she
be
to
take
any
pain
to
marry
him
,
she
would
probably
repent
it
.
<EOS>
six
year
hence
,
if
he
could
meet
with
a
good
sort
of
young
woman
in
the
same
rank
as
his
own

with
a
little
money

it
may
be
very
desirable

,
and
that
be
as
early
as
most
man
can
afford
to
marry
,
who
be
not

to
an
independence
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Martin
,
I
imagine
,
have
his
fortune
entirely
to
make
 
can
not
be
at
all
beforehand
with
the
world
.
<EOS>
whatever
money
he
may
come
into
when
his
father
die
,
whatever
his
share
of
the
family
property
,
it
be
,
I
dare
say
,
all
afloat
,
all
employ
in
his
stock
,
and
so
forth
;
and
though
,
with
diligence
and
good
luck
,
he
may
be
rich
in
time
,
it
be
next
to
impossible
that
he
should
have
realise
any
thing
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
,
so
it
be
.
<EOS>
but
they
live
very
comfortably
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
indoor
man
,
else
they
do
not
want
for
any
thing
;
and
Mrs.
Martin
talk
of
take
a
boy
another
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
may
not
get
into
a
scrape
,
Harriet
,
whenever
he
do
marry
;
 
I
mean
,
as
to
be
acquaint
with
his
wife
 
for
though
his
sister
,
from
a
superior
education
,
be
not
to
be
altogether
object
to
,
it
do
not
follow
that
he
may
marry
any
body
at
all
fit
for
you
to
notice
.
<EOS>
the
misfortune
of
your
birth
ought
to
make
you
particularly
careful
as
to
your
associate
.
<EOS>
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
your
be
a
gentleman
's
daughter
,
and
you
must
support
your
claim
to
that
station
by
every
thing
within
your
own
power
,
or
there
will
be
plenty
of
people
who
would
take
pleasure
in
degrade
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
to
be
sure
,
I
suppose
there
be
.
<EOS>
but
while
I
visit
at
Hartfield
,
and
you
be
so
kind
to
me
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
I
be
not
afraid
of
what
any
body
can
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
understand
the
force
of
influence
pretty
well
,
Harriet
;
but
I
would
have
you
so
firmly
establish
in
good
society
,
as
to
be
independent
even
of
Hartfield
and
Miss
Woodhouse
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
you
permanently
well
connected
,
and
to
that
end
it
will
be
advisable
to
have
as
few
odd
acquaintance
as
may
be
;
and
,
therefore
,
I
say
that
if
you
should
still
be
in
this
country
when
Mr.
Martin
marry
,
I
wish
you
may
not
be
draw
in
by
your
intimacy
with
the
sister
,
to
be
acquaint
with
the
wife
,
who
will
probably
be
some
mere
farmer
's
daughter
,
without
education
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
not
that
I
think
Mr.
Martin
would
ever
marry
any
body
<EOS>
but
what
have
have
some
education
 
and
be
very
well
bring
up
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
do
not
mean
to
set
up
my
opinion
against
yours
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
sure
I
shall
not
wish
for
the
acquaintance
of
his
wife
.
<EOS>
I
shall
always
have
a
great
regard
for
the
Miss
Martins
,
especially
Elizabeth
,
and
should
be
very
sorry
to
give
them
up
,
for
they
be
quite
as
well
educate
as
me
.
<EOS>
but
if
he
marry
a
very
ignorant
,
vulgar
woman
,
certainly
I
have
well
not
visit
her
,
if
I
can
help
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
watch
her
through
the
fluctuation
of
this
speech
,
and
see
no
alarming
symptom
of
love
.
<EOS>
the
young
man
have
be
the
first
admirer
,
but
she
trust
there
be
no
other
hold
,
and
that
there
would
be
no
serious
difficulty
,
on
Harriet
's
side
,
to
oppose
any
friendly
arrangement
of
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
They
meet
Mr.
Martin
the
very
next
day
,
as
they
be
walk
on
the
Donwell
road
.
<EOS>
He
be
on
foot
,
and
after
look
very
respectfully
at
her
,
look
with
most
unfeigned
satisfaction
at
her
companion
.
<EOS>
Emma
be
not
sorry
to
have
such
an
opportunity
of
survey
;
and
walk
a
few
yard
forward
,
while
they
talk
together
,
soon
make
her
quick
eye
sufficiently
acquaint
with
Mr.
Robert
Martin
.
<EOS>
His
appearance
be
very
neat
,
and
he
look
like
a
sensible
young
man
,
but
his
person
have
no
other
advantage
;
and
when
he
come
to
be
contrast
with
gentleman
,
she
think
he
must
lose
all
the
ground
he
have
gain
in
Harriet
's
inclination
.
<EOS>
Harriet
be
not
insensible
of
manner
;
she
have
voluntarily
notice
her
father
's
gentleness
with
admiration
as
well
as
wonder
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Martin
look
as
if
he
do
not
know
what
manner
be
.
  
<EOS>
They
remain
but
a
few
minute
together
,
as
Miss
Woodhouse
must
not
be
keep
wait
;
and
Harriet
then
come
run
to
her
with
a
smile
face
,
and
in
a
flutter
of
spirit
,
which
Miss
Woodhouse
hope
very
soon
to
compose
.
  
<EOS>
"
only
think
of
our
happen
to
meet
him
!
 
<EOS>
how
very
odd
!
<EOS>
It
be
quite
a
chance
,
he
say
,
that
he
have
not
go
round
by
randall
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
think
we
ever
walk
this
road
.
<EOS>
He
think
we
walk
towards
randall
most
day
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
able
to
get
the
romance
of
the
Forest
yet
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
busy
the
last
time
he
be
at
Kingston
that
he
quite
forget
it
,
but
he
go
again
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
so
very
odd
we
should
happen
to
meet
!
<EOS>
well
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
be
he
like
what
you
expect
?
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
of
him
?
<EOS>
do
you
think
him
so
very
plain
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
very
plain
,
undoubtedly
 
remarkably
plain
:
 
but
that
be
nothing
compare
with
his
entire
want
of
gentility
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
right
to
expect
much
,
and
I
do
not
expect
much
;
but
I
have
no
idea
that
he
could
be
so
very
clownish
,
so
totally
without
air
.
<EOS>
I
have
imagine
him
,
I
confess
,
a
degree
or
two
near
gentility
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
to
be
sure
,
"
say
Harriet
,
in
a
mortify
voice
,
"
he
be
not
so
genteel
as
real
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Harriet
,
since
your
acquaintance
with
us
,
you
have
be
repeatedly
in
the
company
of
some
such
very
real
gentleman
,
that
you
must
yourself
be
strike
with
the
difference
in
Mr.
Martin
.
<EOS>
at
Hartfield
,
you
have
have
very
good
specimen
of
well
educate
,
well
breed
man
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
surprize
if
,
after
see
them
,
you
could
be
in
company
with
Mr.
Martin
again
without
perceive
him
to
be
a
very
inferior
creature
 
and
rather
wonder
at
yourself
for
have
ever
think
him
at
all
agreeable
before
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
begin
to
feel
that
now
?
<EOS>
be
not
you
strike
?
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
must
have
be
strike
by
his
awkward
look
and
abrupt
manner
,
and
the
uncouthness
of
a
voice
which
I
hear
to
be
wholly
unmodulated
as
I
stand
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
he
be
not
like
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
such
a
fine
air
and
way
of
walk
as
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
difference
plain
enough
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Knightley
be
so
very
fine
a
man
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Knightley
's
air
be
so
remarkably
good
that
it
be
not
fair
to
compare
Mr.
Martin
with
_
him
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
You
may
not
see
one
in
a
hundred
with
_
gentleman
_
so
plainly
write
as
in
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
not
the
only
gentleman
you
have
be
lately
use
to
.
<EOS>
what
say
you
to
Mr.
Weston
and
Mr.
Elton
?
<EOS>
compare
Mr.
Martin
with
either
of
_
them
_
.
<EOS>
compare
their
manner
of
carry
themselves
;
of
walk
;
of
speak
;
of
be
silent
.
<EOS>
You
must
see
the
difference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
difference
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Weston
be
almost
an
old
man
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
must
be
between
forty
and
fifty
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
which
make
his
good
manner
the
more
valuable
.
<EOS>
the
old
a
person
grow
,
Harriet
,
the
more
important
it
be
that
their
manner
should
not
be
bad
;
the
more
glaring
and
disgust
any
loudness
,
or
coarseness
,
or
awkwardness
become
.
<EOS>
what
be
passable
in
youth
be
detestable
in
later
age

<EOS>
Mr.

be
now
awkward
and
abrupt
;
what
will
he
be
at
Mr.
Weston
's
time
of
life
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
saying
,
indeed
,
"
reply
Harriet
rather
solemnly
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
there
may
be
pretty
good
guess
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
a
completely
gross
,
vulgar
farmer
,
totally
inattentive
to
appearance
,
and
thinking
of
nothing
but
profit
and
loss
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Will
he
,
indeed
?
<EOS>
that
will
be
very
bad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
much
his
business
engross
him
already
be
very
plain
from
the
circumstance
of
his
forgetting
to
inquire
for
the
book
you
recommend
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
great
deal
too
full
of
the
market
to
think
of
any
thing
else
 
which
be
just
as
it
should
be
,
for
a
thriving
man
.
<EOS>
what
have
he
to
do
with
book
?
<EOS>
and
I
have
no
doubt
that
he
_
will
_
thrive
,
and
be
a
very
rich
man
in
time
 
and
his
be
illiterate
and
coarse
need
not
disturb
_
us
_

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
he
do
not
remember
the
book
"
 
be
all
Harriet
's
answer
,
and
speak
with
a
degree
of
grave
displeasure
which
Emma
thought
may
be
safely
leave
to
itself
.
<EOS>
She
,
therefore
,
say
no
more
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
Her
next
beginning
be
,
  
"
<EOS>
in
one
respect
,
perhaps
,
Mr.
Elton
's
manner
be
superior
to
Mr.
Knightley
's
or
Mr.
Weston
's
.
<EOS>
They
have
more
gentleness
.
<EOS>
They
may
be
more
safely
hold
up
as
a
pattern
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
openness
,
a
quickness
,
almost
a
bluntness
in
Mr.
Weston
,
which
every
body
like
in
_
him
<EOS>
_
,
because
there
be
so
much
good
-
humour
with
it
 
but
that
would
not
do
to
be
copy
.
<EOS>
neither
would
Mr.
Knightley
's
downright
,
decide
,
command
sort
of
manner
,
though
it
suit
_
him
_
very
well
;
his
figure
,
and
look
,
and
situation
in
life
seem
to
allow
it
;
but
if
any
young
man
be
to
set
about
copy
him
,
he
would
not
be
sufferable
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
I
think
a
young
man
may
be
very
safely
recommend
to
take
Mr.
Elton
as
a
model
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
be
good
-
humoured
,
cheerful
,
obliging
,
and
gentle
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
me
to
be
grow
particularly
gentle
of
late
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
he
have
any
design
of
ingratiate
himself
with
either
of
us
,
Harriet
,
by
additional
softness
,
but
it
strike
me
that
his
manner
be
soft
than
they
use
to
be
.
<EOS>
if
he
mean
any
thing
,
it
must
be
to
please
you
.
<EOS>
do
not
I
tell
you
what
he
say
of
you
the
other
day
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
then
repeat
some
warm
personal
praise
which
she
have
draw
from
Mr.
Elton
,
and
now
do
full
justice
to
;
and
Harriet
blush
and
smile
,
and
say
she
have
always
think
Mr.
Elton
very
agreeable
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
be
the
very
person
fix
on
by
Emma
for
drive
the
young
farmer
out
of
Harriet
's
head
.
<EOS>
She
think
it
would
be
an
excellent
match
;
and
only
too
palpably
desirable
,
natural
,
and
probable
,
for
her
to
have
much
merit
in
plan
it
.
<EOS>
She
fear
it
be
what
every
body
else
must
think
of
and
predict
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
likely
,
however
,
that
any
body
should
have
equal
her
in
the
date
of
the
plan
,
as
it
have
enter
her
brain
during
the
very
first
evening
of
Harriet
be
come
to
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
the
longer
she
consider
it
,
the
great
be
her
sense
of
its
expediency
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
's
situation
be
most
suitable
,
quite
the
gentleman
himself
,
and
without
low
connexion
;
at
the
same
time
,
not
of
any
family
that
could
fairly
object
to
the
doubtful
birth
of
Harriet
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
comfortable
home
for
her
,
and
Emma
imagine
a
very
sufficient
income
;
for
though
the
vicarage
of
Highbury
be
not
large
,
he
be
know
to
have
some
independent
property
;
and
she
think
very
highly
of
him
as
a
good
-
humoured
,
well
-
mean
,
respectable
young
man
,
without
any
deficiency
of
useful
understanding
or
knowledge
of
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
already
satisfy
herself
that
he
think
Harriet
a
beautiful
girl
,
which
she
trust
,
with
such
frequent
meeting
at
Hartfield
,
be
foundation
enough
on
his
side
;
and
on
Harriet
's
there
could
be
little
doubt
that
the
idea
of
be
prefer
by
him
would
have
all
the
usual
weight
and
efficacy
.
<EOS>
and
he
be
really
a
very
pleasing
young
man
,
a
young
man
whom
any
woman
not
fastidious
may
like
.
<EOS>
He
be
reckon
very
handsome
;
his
person
much
admire
in
general
,
though
not
by
her
,
there
be
a
want
of
elegance
of
feature
which
she
could
not
dispense
with
:
 
<EOS>
but
the
girl
who
could
be
gratify
by
a
Robert
Martin
's
ride
about
the
country
to
get
walnut
for
her
may
very
well
be
conquer
by
Mr.
Elton
's
admiration
.
    
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
your
opinion
may
be

Mrs.
Weston

say
Mr.
Knightley
,
"
of
this
great
intimacy
between
Emma
and
Harriet
Smith

I
think
it
a
bad
thing

bad

you
really

it
a
bad
thing

so

any
good

You
surprize
me
!

Emma
must
do
Harriet
good

by
supply
her
with
a
new
object
of
interest

Harriet
may
be
say
to
do
Emma
good

I
have
be
see
their
intimacy

the
great
pleasure

very
differently
we
feel

<EOS>
not
think
they
will
do
each
other
any
good
!
<EOS>
this
will
certainly
be
the
beginning
of
one
of
our
quarrel
about
Emma
,
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
think
I
be
come
on
purpose
to
quarrel
with
you
,
know
Weston
to
be
out
,
and
that
you
must
still
fight
your
own
battle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Weston
would
undoubtedly
support
me
,
if
he
be
here
,
for
he
think
exactly
as
I
do
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
We
be
speak
of
it
only
yesterday
,
and
agree
how
fortunate
it
be
for
Emma
,
that
there
should
be
such
a
girl
in
Highbury
for
her
to
associate
with
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
,
I
shall
not
allow
you
to
be
a
fair
judge
in
this
case
.
<EOS>
You
be
so
much
use
to
live
alone
,
that
you
do
not
know
the
value
of
a
companion
;
and
,
perhaps
no
man
can
be
a
good
judge
of
the
comfort
a
woman
feel
in
the
society
of
one
of
her
own
sex
,
after
be
use
to
it
all
her
life
.
<EOS>
I
can
imagine
your
objection
to
Harriet
Smith
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
the
superior
young
woman
which
Emma
's
friend
ought
to
be
.
<EOS>
but
on
the
other
hand
,
as
Emma
want
to
see
her
better
inform
,
it
will
be
an
inducement
to
her
to
read
more
herself
.
<EOS>
They
will
read
together
.
<EOS>
She
mean
it
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Emma
have
be
mean
to
read
more
ever
since
she
be
twelve
year
old
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
a
great
many
list
of
her
drawing
-
up
at
various
time
of
book
that
she
mean
to
read
regularly
through
 
and
<EOS>
very
good
list
<EOS>
they
be
 
very
well
choose
,
and
very
neatly
arrange
 
sometimes
alphabetically
,
and
sometimes
by
some
other
rule
.
<EOS>
the
list
she
draw
up
when
only
fourteen
 
<EOS>
I
remember
think
it
do
her
judgment
<EOS>
so
much
credit
<EOS>
,
that
I
preserve
it
some
time
;
and
I
dare
say
she
may
have
make
out
a
very
good
list
now
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
do
with
expect
any
course
of
steady
reading
from
Emma
.
<EOS>
She
will
never
submit
to
any
thing
require
industry
and
patience
,
and
a
subjection
of
the
fancy
to
the
understanding
.
<EOS>
where
Miss
Taylor
fail
to
stimulate
,
I
may
safely
affirm
that
Harriet
Smith
will
do
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
You
never
could
persuade
her
to
read
half
so
much
as
you
wish
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
you
could
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
,
"
reply
Mrs.
Weston
,
smile
,
"
that
I
think
<EOS>
so
_
then
_
;
 
<EOS>
but
since
we
have
part
,
I
can
never
remember
Emma
be
omit
to
do
any
thing
I
wish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
hardly
any
desire
to
refresh
such
a
memory
as
_
that
_
,
"
 
say
Mr.
Knightley
,
feelingly
;
and
for
a
moment
or
two
he
have
do
.
"
<EOS>
but
I
,
"
he
soon
add
,
"
who
have
have
no
such
charm
throw
over
my
sense
,
must
still
see
,
hear
,
and
remember
.
<EOS>
Emma
be
spoil
by
be
the
clever
of
her
family
.
<EOS>
at
ten
year
old
,
she
have
the
misfortune
of
be
able
to
answer
question
which
puzzle
her
sister
at
seventeen
.
<EOS>
She
be
always
quick
and
assure
:
isabella
slow
and
diffident
.
<EOS>
and
ever
since
she
be
twelve
,
Emma
have
be
mistress
of
the
house
and
of
you
all
.
<EOS>
in
her
mother
she
lose
the
only
person
able
to
cope
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
inherit
her
mother
's
talent
,
and
must
have
be
under
subjection
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
be
sorry
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
to
be
dependent
on
_
your
_
recommendation
,
have
I
quit
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
family
and
want
another
situation
;
I
do
not
think
you
would
have
speak
a
good
word
for
me
to
any
body
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
always
think
me
unfit
for
the
office
I
hold
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
he
,
smile
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
better
place
_
here
_
;
very
fit
for
a
wife
,
but
not
at
all
for

governess
.
<EOS>
but
you
be
prepare
yourself
to
be
an
excellent
wife
all
the
time
you
be
at
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
You
may
not
give
Emma
such
a
complete
education
as
your
power
would
seem
to
promise
;
but
you
be
receive
a
very
good
education
from
_
her
_
,
on
the
very
material
matrimonial
point
of
submit
your
own
will

do
as
you

bid

and
if
Weston
have
ask
me

recommend
him

I
should
certainly
have
name
Miss
Taylor

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you

<EOS>
there
will
be
very
little
merit

a

Mr.

"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
to
own
the
truth

I
be
afraid
you
be
rather
throw
away
,
and
that
with
every
disposition
to
bear
,
there
will
be
nothing
to
be
bear
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
despair
,
however
.
<EOS>
Weston
may
grow
cross
from
the
wantonness
of
comfort
,
or
his
son
may
plague
him

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
_
<EOS>
that
_
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not

<EOS>
no
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
do
not
foretell
vexation
from
that
quarter

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
I
,
indeed

<EOS>
I
only
name
possibility

<EOS>
I
do
not
pretend
to
Emma
's
genius
for
foretell
and
guess
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
with
all
my
heart
,
the
young
man
may
be
a
Weston
in
merit
,
and
a
Churchill
in
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
but
Harriet
Smith
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
half
do
about
Harriet
Smith
.
<EOS>
I
think
her
the
very
bad
sort
of
companion
that
Emma
could
possibly
have
.
<EOS>
She
know
nothing
herself
,
and
look
upon
Emma
as
know
every
thing
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
flatterer
in
all
her
way
;
and
so
much
the
bad
,
because
undesigned
.
<EOS>
Her
ignorance
be
hourly
flattery
.
<EOS>
how
can
Emma
imagine
she
have
any
thing
to
learn
herself
,
while
Harriet
be
present
such
a
delightful
inferiority
?
<EOS>
and
as
for
Harriet
,
I
will
venture
to
say
that
_
she
_
can
not
gain
by
the
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Hartfield
will
only
put
her
out
of
conceit
with
all
the
other
place
she
belong
to
.
<EOS>
She
will
grow
just
refine
enough
to
be
uncomfortable
with
those
among
whom
birth
and
circumstance
have
place
her
home
.
<EOS>
I
be
much
mistake
if
Emma
's
doctrine
give
any
strength
of
mind
,
or
tend
at
all
to
make
a
girl
adapt
herself
rationally
to
the
variety
of
her
situation
in
life
.
 
<EOS>
They
only
give
a
little
polish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
either
depend
more
upon
Emma
's
good
sense
than
you
do
,
or
be
more
anxious
for
her
present
comfort
;
for
I
can
not
lament
the
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
how
well
she
look
last
night
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
you
would
rather
talk
of
her
person
than
her
mind

would
you
?
<EOS>
very
well
;
I
shall
not
attempt
to
deny
Emma
's
be
pretty

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
pretty
!
say
beautiful
rather

Can
you
imagine
any
thing
near
perfect
beauty
than
Emma
altogether
 
face
and
figure
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
I
could
imagine
,
but
I
confess
that
I
have
seldom
see
a
face
or
figure
more
pleasing
to
me
than
hers
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
a
partial
old
friend

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
such
an
eye

<EOS>
the
true
hazle
eye

so
brilliant

regular

countenance

a

upright
figure

there
be
health

not
merely
in
her
bloom

in
her
air

her
head
,
her
glance

one
hear
sometimes
of
a

"
the
picture

health

now
,
Emma
always

me
the
idea

up
health

not

I
think
her
all
you
describe

<EOS>
I
love

at

I
will
add
this
praise

that
I

Mrs.

excuse
me

so
do
I
,

very
much

"
  
<EOS>

She
always
declare
she
will
never
marry
,
which
,
of
course
,
mean
just
nothing
at
all

<EOS>
but
I
have
no
idea
that
she
have
yet
ever
see
a
man
she
care

It
would
not
be
a
bad
thing
for
her
to
be
very
much
in

proper
object

I
should
like
to
see
Emma
in
love
,

in
some
doubt
of
a
return
;
it
would
do
her
good
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
nobody
hereabouts
to
attach
her
;

she
go
so
seldom
from
home

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
do

seem

Mrs.

can
well

not

form
any
attachment

would

create
such
difficulty
on

Mr.
Woodhouse

account

<EOS>
I
do
not
recommend
matrimony
at

Emma

though
I
mean
no
slight
to
the
state
,
I
assure
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
part
of
her
meaning
be
to
conceal
some
favourite
thought
of
her
own
and
Mr.
Weston
's
on
the
subject
,
as
much
as
possible
.
<EOS>
there
be
wish
at
randall
respect
Emma
's
destiny
,
but
it
be
not
desirable
to
have
them
suspect
;
and
the
quiet
transition
which
Mr.
Knightley
soon
afterwards
make
to
"
what
do
Weston
think
of
the
weather
;
shall
we
have
rain
?
"
convince
her
that
he
have
nothing
more
to
say
or
surmise
about
Hartfield
.
    
<EOS>
Emma
could
not
feel
a
doubt
of
have
give
Harriet
's
fancy
a
proper
direction
and
raise
the
gratitude
of
her
young
vanity
to
a
very
good
purpose
,
for
she
find
her
decidedly
more
sensible
than
before
of
Mr.
Elton
's
be
a
remarkably
handsome
man
,
with
most
agreeable
manner
;
and
as
she
have
no
hesitation
in
follow
up
the
assurance
of
his
admiration
by
agreeable
hint
,
she
be
soon
pretty
confident
of
create
as
much
like
on
Harriet
's
side
,
as
there
could
be
any
occasion
for
.
<EOS>
She
be
quite
convinced
of
Mr.
Elton

be
in
the
fair
way
of
fall
in
love
,
if
not
in
love
already
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
scruple
with
regard
to
him
.

He
talk
of
Harriet
,

praise
her
so
warmly
,
that
she
could
not
suppose
any
thing
want
which
a
little
time

<EOS>
His
perception
of
the
striking
improvement
of
Harriet
's
manner
,
since
her
introduction
at
Hartfield
,
be
not
one
of
the
least
agreeable
proof
of
his
grow
attachment
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
give
Miss
Smith
all
that
she
require
,
"
say
he
;
"
you
have
make
her
graceful
and
easy
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
beautiful
creature
when
she
come
to
you
,
but
,
in
my
opinion
,
the
attraction
you
have
add
be
infinitely
superior
to
what
she
receive
from
nature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
you
think
I
have
be
useful
to
her
;
but
Harriet
only
want
draw
out
,
and
receive
a
few
,
very
few
hint
.
<EOS>
She
have
all
the
natural
grace
of
sweetness
of
temper
and
artlessness
in
herself
.
<EOS>
I
have
do
very
little
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
admissible
to
contradict
a
lady
,
"
say
the
gallant
Mr.
Elton
    
<EOS>
"
I
have
perhaps
give
her
a
little
more
decision
of
character
,
have
teach
her
to
think
on
point
which
have
not
fall
in
her
way
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
exactly
so
;
that
be
what
principally
strike
me

<EOS>
so
much
superadde
decision

character

<EOS>
skilful
have
be
the

<EOS>
"
great
have
be
the
pleasure

I
be
sure

<EOS>
I
never
meet
with
a
disposition
more
truly
amiable

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
of
it

"
<EOS>
and
it
be
speak
with
a
sort
of
sigh
animation
,
which
have
a
vast
deal
of
the
lover
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
less
pleased
another
day
with
the
manner
in
which
he
second
a
sudden
wish
of
her
,
to
have
Harriet
's
picture
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
ever
have
your
likeness
take
,
Harriet
?
"
say
she
:
"
do
you
ever
sit
for
your
picture
?
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
be
on
the
point
of
leave
the
room
,
and
only
stopt
to
say
,
with
a
very
interesting
naivete
,
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
dear
,
no
,
never

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
no
sooner
be
she
out
of
sight
,
than
Emma
exclaim
,
  
<EOS>
"
what
an
exquisite
possession
a
good
picture
of
her
would
be
!
<EOS>
I
would
give
any
money
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
almost
long
to
attempt
her
likeness
myself
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
it
<EOS>
I
dare
say
,
but
two
or
three
year
ago
I
have
a
great
passion
for
take
likeness
,
and
attempt
several
of
my
friend
,
and
be
think
to
have
a
tolerable
eye
in
general
.
<EOS>
but
from
one
cause
or
another
,
I
give
it
up
in
disgust
.
<EOS>
but
really
,
I
could
almost
venture
,
if
Harriet
would
sit
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
such
a
delight
to
have
her
picture
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
entreat
you
,
"
cry
Mr.
Elton
;
"
it
would
indeed
be
a
delight
!
<EOS>
let
me
entreat
you
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
to
exercise
so
charm
a
talent
in
favour
of
your
friend
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
your
drawing
be
.
<EOS>
how
could
you
suppose
me
ignorant
?
<EOS>
be
not
this
room
rich
in
specimen
of
your
landscape
and
flower
;
and
have
not
Mrs.
Weston
<EOS>
some
inimitable
figure
-
piece
in
her
drawing
-
room
,
at
randall
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
yes
,
good
man
!
 
<EOS>
think
Emma
 
<EOS>
but
what
have
all
that
to
do
with
take
likeness
?
<EOS>
You
know
nothing
of
draw
.
<EOS>
do
not
pretend
to
be
in
rapture
about
mine
.
<EOS>
keep
your
rapture
for
Harriet
's
face
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
if
you
give
me
such
kind
encouragement
,
Mr.
Elton
,
I
believe
I
shall
try
what
I
can
do
.
<EOS>
Harriet
's
feature
be
very
delicate
,
which
make
a
likeness
difficult
;
and
yet
there
be
a
peculiarity
in
the
shape
of
the
eye
and
the
line
about
the
mouth
which
one
ought
to
catch
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
exactly
so
 
the
shape
of
the
eye
and
the
line
about
the
mouth
 
I
have
not
a
doubt
of
your
success
.
<EOS>
pray
,
pray
attempt
it
.
<EOS>
as
you
will
do
it
,
it
will
indeed
,
to
use
your
own
word
,
be
an
exquisite
possession
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
be
afraid
,
Mr.
Elton
,
Harriet
will
not
like
to
sit
.
<EOS>
She
think
so
little
of
her
own
beauty
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
observe
her
manner
of
answer
me
?
<EOS>
how
completely
it
mean
,
"
why
should
my
picture
be
draw
?
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
I
observe
it
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
lose
on
me
.
<EOS>
but
still
I
can
not
imagine
she
would
not
be
persuade
.
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
be
soon
back
again
,
and
the
proposal
almost
immediately
make
;
and
she
have
no
scruple
which
could
stand
many
minute
against
the
earnest
pressing
of
both
the
other
.
<EOS>
Emma
wish
to
go
to
work
directly
,
and
therefore
produce
the
portfolio
contain
her
various
attempt
at
portrait
,
for
not
one
of
them
have
ever
be
finish
,
that
they
may
decide
together
on
the
good
size
for
Harriet
.
<EOS>
Her
many
beginning
be
display
.
<EOS>
miniature
,
half
-
length
,
whole
-
length
,
pencil
,
crayon
,
and
water
-
colour
have
be
all
try
in
turn
.
<EOS>
She
have
always
want
to
do
every
thing
,
and
have
make
more
progress
both
in
drawing
and
music
than
many
may
have
do
with
so
little
labour
as
she
would
ever
submit
to
.
<EOS>
She
play
and
sing
;
 
and
draw
in
almost
every
style
;
but
steadiness
have
always
be
want
;
and
in
nothing
have
she
approach
the
degree
of
excellence
which
she
would
have
be
glad
to
command
,
and
ought
not
to
have
fail
of
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
much
deceive
as
to
her
own
skill
either
as
an
artist
or
a
musician
,
but
she
be
not
unwilling
to
have
other
deceive
,
or
sorry
to
know
her
reputation
for
accomplishment
often
high
than
it
deserve
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
merit
in
every
drawing
 
in
the
least
finished
,
perhaps
the
most
;
her
style
be
spirit
;
but
have
there
be
much
less
,
or
have
there
be
ten
time
more
,
<EOS>
the
delight
and
admiration
of
her
two
companion
would
have
be
the
same
.
<EOS>
They
be
both
in
ecstasy
.
<EOS>
a
likeness
please
every
body
;
and
Miss
Woodhouse
's
performance
must
be
capital
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
great
variety
of
face
for
you
,
"
say
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
only
my
own
family
to
study
from
.
<EOS>
there
be
my
father
 
another
of
my
father
 
but
the
idea
of
sit
for
his
picture
make
him
so
nervous
,
that
I
could
only
take
him
by
stealth
;
neither
of
them
very
like
therefore
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
again
,
and
again
,
and
again
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
dear
Mrs.
Weston
!
<EOS>
always
my
kind
friend
on
every
occasion
.
<EOS>
She
would
sit
whenever
I
ask
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
my
sister
;
and
really
quite
her
own
little
elegant
figure
!
 
<EOS>
and
the
face
not
unlike
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
make
a
good
likeness
of
her
,
if
she
would
have
sit
longer
,
but
she
be
in
such
a
hurry
to
have
me
draw
her
four
child
that
she
would
not
be
quiet
.
<EOS>
then
,
here
come
all
my
attempt
at
three
of
those
four
child
;
 
there
they
be
,
Henry
and
John
and
Bella
,
from
one
end
of
the
sheet
to
the
other
,
and
any
one
of
them
may
do
for
any
one
of
the
rest
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
eager
to
have
them
draw
that
I
could
not
refuse
;
but
there
be
no
make
child
of
three
or
four
year
old
stand
still
you
know
;
nor
can
it
be
very
easy
to
take
any
likeness
of
them
,
beyond
the
air
and
complexion
,
unless
they
be
coarser
feature
than
any
of
mama
's
child
ever
be
.
<EOS>
here
be
my
sketch
of
the
fourth
,
who
be
a
baby
.
<EOS>
I
take
him
as
he
be
sleep
on
the
sofa
,
and
it
be
as
strong
a
likeness
of
his
cockade
as
you
would
wish
to
see
.
<EOS>
He
have
nestle
down
his
head
most
conveniently
.
<EOS>
that
be
very
like
.
<EOS>
I
be
rather
proud
of
little
George
.
<EOS>
the
corner
of
the
sofa
be
very
good
.
<EOS>
then
here
be
my
last
,
"
 
unclose
a
pretty
sketch
of
a
gentleman
in
small
size
,
whole
-
length
 
"
my
last
and
my
good
 
<EOS>
my
brother
,
Mr.
John
Knightley
.
 
<EOS>
this
do
not
want
much
of
be
finish
,
when
I
put
it
away
in
a
pet
,
and
vow
I
would
never
take
another
likeness
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
be
provoke
;
for
after
all
my
pain
,
and
when
I
have
really
make
a
very
good
likeness
of
it
 
<EOS>
(
Mrs.
Weston
and
I
be
quite
agree
in
think
it
_
very
_
like
)
 
<EOS>
only
too
handsome
 
too
flattering
 
<EOS>
but
that
be
a
fault
on
the
right
side
<EOS>
"
 
after
all
this
,
come
poor
dear
Isabella
's
cold
approbation
of
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
it
be
a
little
like
 
but
to
be
sure
it
do
not
do
him
justice
.
<EOS>
We
have
have
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
persuade
him
to
sit
at
all
.
<EOS>
It
be
make
a
great
favour
of
;
and
altogether
it
be
more
than
I
could
bear
;
and
so
I
never
would
finish
it
,
to
have
it
apologise
over
as
an
unfavourable
likeness
,
to
every
morning
visitor
in
Brunswick
Square
;
 
and
,
as
I
say
,
I
do
then
forswear
ever
draw
any
body
again
.
<EOS>
but
for
Harriet
's
sake
,
or
rather
for
my
own
,
and
as
there
be
no
husband
and
wife
in
the
case
_
at
_
_
<EOS>
present

,
I
will
break
my
resolution
now

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
seem
very
properly
strike
and
delight
by
the
idea
,
and
be
repeat
,
"
no
husband
and
wife
in
the
case
at
present
indeed
,
as
you
observe
.
<EOS>
exactly
so
.
<EOS>
no
husband
and
wife
,
"
with
so
interesting
a
consciousness
,
that
Emma
begin
to
consider
whether
she
have
not
better
leave
them
together
at
once
.
<EOS>
but
as
she
want
to
be
draw
,
the
declaration
must
wait
a
little
longer
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
soon
fix
on
the
size
and
sort
of
portrait
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
a
whole
-
length
in
water
-
colour
,
like
Mr.
John
Knightley
's
,
and
be
destine
,
if
she
could
please
herself
,
to
hold
a
very
honourable
station
over
the
mantelpiece
.
  
<EOS>
the
sit
begin
;
and
Harriet
,
smile
and
blush
,
and
afraid
of
not
keep
her
attitude
and
countenance
,
present
a
very
sweet
mixture
of
youthful
expression
to
the
steady
eye
of
the
artist
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
do
any
thing
,
with
Mr.
Elton
fidget
behind
her
and
watch
every
touch
.
<EOS>
She
give
him
credit
for
station
himself
where
he
may
gaze
and
gaze
again
without
offence
;
but
be
really
oblige
to
put
an
end
to
it
,
and
request
him
to
place
himself
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
It
then
occur
to
her
to
employ
him
in
reading
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
he
would
be
so
good
as
to
read
to
them
,
it
would
be
a
kindness
indeed
!
<EOS>
It
would
amuse
away
the
difficulty
of
her
part
,
and
lessen
the
irksomeness
of
Miss
Smith
's
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
be
only
too
happy
.
<EOS>
Harriet
listen
,
and
Emma
draw
in
peace
.
<EOS>
She
must
allow
him
to
be
still
frequently
come
to
look
;
any
thing
less
would
certainly
have
be
too
little
in
a
lover
;
and
he
be
ready
at
the
small
intermission
of
the
pencil
,
to
jump
up
and
see
the
progress
,
and
be
charm
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
be
displeased
with
such
an
encourager
,
for
his
admiration
make
him
discern
a
likeness
almost
before
it
be
possible
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
respect
his
eye
,
but
his
love
and
his
complaisance
be
unexceptionable
.
  
<EOS>
the
sitting
be
altogether
very
satisfactory
;
she
be
quite
enough
pleased
with
the
first
day
's
sketch
to
wish
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
want
of
likeness
,
she
have
be
fortunate
in
the
attitude
,
and
as
she
mean
to
throw
in
a
little
improvement
to
the
figure
,
to
give
a
little
more
height
,
and
considerably
more
elegance
,
she
have
great
confidence
of
its
being
in
every
way
a
pretty
drawing
at
last
,
and
of
its
fill
its
destine
place
with
credit
to
them
both
 
a
standing
memorial
of
the
beauty
of
one
,
the
skill
of
the
other

and
the
friendship
of
both
;
with
as
many
other
agreeable
association
as
Mr.
Elton
's
very
promising
attachment
be
likely
to
add
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
be
to
sit
again
the
next
day
;
and
Mr.
Elton
,
just
as
he
ought
,
entreat
for
the
permission
of
attend
and
read
to
them
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
by
all
mean

We
shall
be
most
happy
to
consider
you

one
of
the
party

<EOS>
the
same
civility
and
courtesy
,
the
same
success
and
satisfaction
,
take
place
on
the
morrow
,
and
accompany
the
whole
progress
of
the
picture

which
be
rapid
and
happy

every
body
who
see
it
be
pleased

Mr.

be
in
continual
rapture

defend
it
through
every
criticism

the
expression

do
you
think
so

reply
he

I
can
not

you

It
appear

me
a

I
never
see
such
a

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
make
her
too
tall
,
Emma
,
"
say
Mr.
Knightley
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
know
that
she
have
,
but
would
not
own
it
;
and
Mr.
Elton
warmly
add
,
  
"
<EOS>
oh
no
!
<EOS>
certainly
not
too
tall
;
not
in
the
least
too
tall
.
<EOS>
consider
,
she
be
sit
down
 
which
naturally
present
a
different
 
which
in
short
give
exactly
the
idea
 
and
the
proportion
must
be
preserve
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
proportion
,
fore
-
shorten
.
 
<EOS>
oh
no
!
<EOS>
it
give
one
exactly
the
idea
of
such
a
height
as
Miss
Smith
's
.
<EOS>
exactly
so
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
pretty
,
"
say
Mr.
Woodhouse
.
<EOS>
"
so
prettily
do
!
<EOS>
just
as
your
drawing
always
be
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
any
body
who
draw
so
well
as
you
do
.
<EOS>
the
only
thing
I
do
not
thoroughly
like
be
,
that
she
seem
to
be
sit
out
of
door
,
with
only
a
little
shawl
over
her
shoulder
 
<EOS>
and
it
make
one
think
she
must
catch
cold
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
my
dear
papa
,
it
be
suppose
to
be
summer
;
a
warm
day
in
summer
.
<EOS>
look
at
the
tree
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
never
safe
to
sit
out
of
door
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
,
sir
,
may
say
any
thing
,
"
cry
Mr.
Elton
,
"
but
I
must
confess
that
I
regard
it
as
a
most
happy
thought
,
the
placing
of
Miss
Smith
out
of
door
;
and
the
tree
be
touch
with
such
inimitable
spirit
!
<EOS>
any
other
situation
would
have
be
much
less
in
character
.
<EOS>
the
naivete
of
Miss
Smith
's
manner
 
and
altogether
 
oh
,
it
be
most
admirable
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
keep
my
eye
from
it
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
such
a
likeness
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
next
thing
want
be
to
get
the
picture
frame
;
and
here
be
a
few
difficulty
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
do
directly
;
it
must
be
do
in
London
;
the
order
must
go
through
the
hand
of
some
intelligent
person
whose
taste
could
be
depend
on
;
and
Isabella
,
the
usual
doer
of
all
commission
,
must
not
be
apply
to
,
because
it
be
December
,
and
Mr.
Woodhouse
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
her
stir
out
of
her
house
in
the
fog
of
December
.
<EOS>
but
no
sooner
be
the
distress
know
to
Mr.
Elton
,
than
it
be
remove
.
<EOS>
His
gallantry
be
always
on
the
alert
.
<EOS>
"
may
he
be
trust
with
the
commission
,
what
infinite
pleasure
should
he
have
in
execute
it
!
<EOS>
he
could
ride
to
London
at
any
time
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
say
how
much
he
should
be
gratify
by
be
employ
on
such
an
errand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
too
good
!
 
<EOS>
she
could
not
endure
the
thought
!
 
<EOS>
she
would
not
give
him
such
a
troublesome
office
for
the
world
,
"
 
bring
on
the
desire
repetition
of
entreaty
and
assurance
,
 
and
a
very
few
minute
settle
the
business
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
be
to
take
the
drawing
to
London
,
chuse
the
frame
,
and
give
the
direction
;
and
Emma
think
she
could
so
pack
it
as
to
ensure
its
safety
without
much
incommode
him
,
while
he
seem
mostly
fearful
of
not
be
incommode
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
precious
deposit
!
"
say
he
with
a
tender
sigh
,
as
he
receive
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
man
be
almost
too
gallant
to
be
in
love
,
"
think
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
so
,
but
that
I
suppose
there
may
be
a
hundred
different
way
of
be
in
love
.
<EOS>
He
be
an
excellent
young
man
,
and
will
suit
Harriet
exactly
;
it
will
be
an
"
exactly
so
,
"
as
he
say
himself
;
but
he
do
sigh
and
languish
,
and
study
for
compliment
rather
more
than
I
could
endure
as
a
principal
.
<EOS>
I
come
in
for
a
pretty
good
share
as
a
second
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
his
gratitude
on
Harriet
's
account
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
very
day
of
Mr.
Elton
be
go
to
London
produce
a
fresh
occasion
for
Emma
's
service
towards
her
friend
.
<EOS>
Harriet
have
be
at
Hartfield
,
as
usual
,
soon
after
breakfast
;
and
,
after
a
time
,
have
go
home
to
return
again
to
dinner
<EOS>
:
she
return
,
and
sooner
than
have
be
talk
of
,
and
with
an
agitated
,
hurried
look
,
announce
something
extraordinary
to
have
happen
which
she
be
long
to
tell
.
<EOS>
half
a
minute
bring
it
all
out
.
<EOS>
She
have
hear
,
as
soon
as
she
get
back
to
Mrs.
Goddard
's
,
that
Mr.
Martin
have
be
there
an
hour
before
,
and
find
she
be
not
at
home
,
nor
particularly
expect
,
<EOS>
have
leave
a
little
parcel
for
her
from
one
of
his
sister
,
and
go
away
;
and
on
open
this
parcel
,
she
have
actually
find
,
besides
the
two
song
which
she
have
lend
Elizabeth
to
copy
,
a
letter
to
herself
;
and
this
letter
be
from
him
,
from
Mr.
Martin
,
and
contain
a
direct
proposal
of
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
who
could
have
think
it
?
<EOS>
She
be
so
surprized
she
do
not
know
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
yes
,
quite
a
proposal
of
marriage
;
and
a
very
good
letter
<EOS>
,
at
least
she
think
so
.
<EOS>
and
he
write
as
if
he
really
love
her
very
much
 
<EOS>
but
she
do
not
know
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
she
be
come
as
fast
as
she
could
to
ask
Miss
Woodhouse
what
she
should
do
.
 
<EOS>
"
Emma
be
half
-
ashamed
of
her
friend
for
seem
so
pleased
and
so
doubtful
.
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
"
she
cry
,
"
the
young
man
be
determine
not
to
lose
any
thing
for
want
of

.
<EOS>
He
will
connect
himself
well
if
he
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
read
the
letter
?
"
cry
Harriet
.
<EOS>
"
pray
do
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
you
would
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
be
not
sorry
to
be
press
.
<EOS>
She
read
,
and
be
surprize
.
<EOS>
the
style
of
the
letter
be
much
above
her
expectation
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
merely
no
grammatical
error
,
but
as
a
composition
it
would
not
have
disgrace
a
gentleman
;
the
language
,
though
plain
,
be
strong
and
unaffected
,
and
the
sentiment
it
convey
very
much
to
the
credit
of
the
writer
.
<EOS>
It
be
short
,
but
express
good
sense
,
warm
attachment
,
liberality
,
propriety
,
even
delicacy
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
She
pause
over
it
,
while
Harriet
stand
anxiously
watch
for
her
opinion
,
with
a
"
well
,
well
,
"
and
be
at
last
force
to
add
,
"
be
it
a
good
letter
?
<EOS>
or
be
it
too
short
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
indeed
,
a
very
good
letter
,
"
reply
Emma
rather
slowly
 
"
so
good
a
letter
,
Harriet
,
that
every
thing
consider
<EOS>
,
I
think
one
of
his
sister
must
have
help
him
.
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
imagine
the
young
man
whom
I
see
talk
with
you
the
other
day
could
express
himself
so
well
,
if
leave
quite
to
his
own
power
,
and
yet
it
be
not
the
style
of
a
woman
;
no
,
certainly
,
it
be
too
strong
and
concise
;
not
diffuse
enough
for
a
woman
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
he
be
a
sensible
man
,
and
I
suppose
may
have
a
natural
talent
for
 
think
strongly
and
clearly
 
<EOS>
and
when
he
take
a
pen
in
hand
,
his
thought
naturally
find
proper
word
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
with
some
man
.
<EOS>
yes
,
I
understand
the
sort
of
mind
.
<EOS>
vigorous
,
decide
,
with
sentiment
to
a
certain
point
,
not
coarse
.
<EOS>
a
better
write
letter
,
Harriet
(
return
it
,
)
than
I
have
expect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,

say
the
still
wait
Harriet
;
 
"
well
 
and
 
and
what
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
shall
you
do

<EOS>
in
what
respect

do
you
mean
with
regard
to
this
letter

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes

what
be
you
in

You
must
answer
it
of
course

speedily

"
  
"
<EOS>
yes

what
shall
I
say
?
<EOS>
Dear
Miss
Woodhouse
,
do
advise
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
no
,
no
!
<EOS>
the
letter
have
much
well
be
all
your
own
.
<EOS>
You
will
express
yourself
very
properly
,
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
danger
of
your
not
be
intelligible
,
which
be
the
first
thing
.
<EOS>
Your
meaning
must
be
unequivocal
;
no
doubt
or
demur
:
and
such
expression
of
gratitude
and
concern
for
the
pain
you
be
inflict
as
propriety
require
,
will
present
themselves
unbidden
to
_
<EOS>
your
_
mind
,
I
be
persuade
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
be
prompt
to
write
with
the
appearance
of
sorrow
for
his
disappointment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
I
ought
to
refuse
him
then
,

say
Harriet
,
look
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ought
to
refuse
him
!
<EOS>
My
dear
Harriet
,
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
be
you
in
any
doubt
as
to
that
?
<EOS>
I
think
 
<EOS>
but
I
beg
your
pardon
<EOS>
,
perhaps
I
have
be
under
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
I
certainly
have
be
misunderstand
you
,
if
you
feel
in
doubt
as
to
the
_
purport
_
of
your
answer
.
<EOS>
I
have
imagine
you
be
consult
me
only
as
to
the
wording
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
be
silent
.
<EOS>
with
a
little
reserve
of
manner
,
Emma
continue
:
  
"
You
mean
to
return
a
favourable
answer
,
I
collect
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
do
not
;
that
is
,
I
do
not
mean

what
shall
I
do

what
would
you
advise
me
to
do

,

Miss
Woodhouse

tell
me
what
I
ought

I
shall
not

you
any
advice

Harriet

I
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
point
which
you
must
settle
with
your
feeling
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
notion
that
he
like
me
so
very
much

"
say
Harriet
,
contemplate
the
letter
.
<EOS>
for
a
little
while
Emma
persevere
in
her
silence
;
but
begin
to
apprehend
the
bewitching
flattery
of
that
letter
may
be
too
powerful
,
she
think
it
best
to
say
,
  
"
I
lie
it
down
as
a
general
rule
,
Harriet
,
that
if
a
woman
_
doubt
_
as
to
whether
she
should
accept
a
man
or
not
,
she
certainly
ought
to
refuse
him
.
<EOS>
if
she
can
hesitate
as
to
"
yes
,
"
she
ought
to
say
"
no
"
directly
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
state
to
be
safely
enter
into
with
doubtful
feeling
,
with
half
a
heart
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
my
duty
as
a
friend
,
and
old
than
yourself
,
to
say
thus
much
to
you
.
<EOS>
but
do
not
imagine
that
I
want
to
influence
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
no
,
I
be
sure
you
be
a
great
deal
too
kind
to
 
<EOS>
but
if
you
would
just
advise
me
what
I
have
best
do
 
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
I
do
not
mean
that
 
as
you
say
,
one
's
mind
ought
to
be
quite
make
up
 
one
should
not
be
hesitate
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
serious
thing
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
safe
to
say
"
no
,
"
perhaps
.

do
you
think
I
have
better
say
"
no
?
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
for
the
world

say
Emma
,
smile
graciously

would
I
advise
you
either
way
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
the
good
judge
of
your
own
happiness

if
you
prefer
Mr.
Martin
to
every

if
you

him
the
most
agreeable
man
you
have
ever

why
should
you
hesitate
?
<EOS>
You
blush
,
Harriet

<EOS>
do
any
body
else
occur
to
you
at
this
moment
under
such
a
definition
?
<EOS>
Harriet
,
Harriet

do
not
deceive
yourself
;
do
not
be
run
away
with
by
gratitude
and
compassion

at
this
moment
whom
be
you
think
of

<EOS>
the
symptom
be
favourable

<EOS>
instead
of
answer
,
Harriet
turn
away
confused
,
and
stand
thoughtfully
by
the
fire
;
and
though
the
letter
be
still
in
her
hand
,
it
be
now
mechanically
twist
about
without
regard
.
<EOS>
Emma
wait
the
result
with
impatience
,
but
not
without
strong
hope
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
with
some
hesitation
,
Harriet
say
    
"
Miss
Woodhouse
,
as
you
will
not
give
me
your
opinion
,
I
must
do
as
well
as
I
can
by
myself
;
and
I
have
now
quite
determined
,
and
really
almost
make
up
my
mind
 
to
refuse
Mr.
Martin
.
<EOS>
do
you
think
I
be
right
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

perfectly
,
perfectly
right

my
dear
Harriet

you
be
do
just
what
you
ought

while
you
be
at
all
in
suspense
I
keep
my
feeling
to
myself

now
that
you
be
so
completely
decide
I
have
no
hesitation
in
approve
.
<EOS>
dear
Harriet
,
I
give
myself
joy
of
this
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
grieve
me
to
lose
your
acquaintance
,
which
must
have
be
the
consequence
of
your
marry
Mr.
Martin

while
you
be
in
the
small
degree
wavering
,
I
say
nothing
about
it
,
because
I
would
not
influence
;
but
it
would
have
be
the
loss
of
a
friend
to
me

I
could
not
have
visit
Mrs.
Robert
Martin

of
Abbey

Mill
Farm

I
be
secure
of
you
for
ever

Harriet
have
not
surmise
her
own
danger

the
idea

it
strike
her
forcibly

You

visit
me

,

aghast

"
<EOS>
no
,
to
be
sure
you
could
not
;
but
I
never
think
of
that
before

<EOS>
that
would
have
be
too
dreadful
!
 
<EOS>
what
an
escape
!
 
<EOS>
Dear
Miss
Woodhouse
,
I
would
not
give
up
the
pleasure
and
honour
of
be
intimate
with
you
for
any
thing
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
indeed
,
Harriet
,
it
would
have
be
a
severe
pang
to
lose
you
;
but
it
must
have
be
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
throw
yourself
out
of
all
good
society
.
<EOS>
I
must
have
give
you
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
how
should
I
ever
have
bear
it
!
<EOS>
It
would
have
kill
me
never
to
come
to
Hartfield
any
more
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
dear
affectionate
creature
!
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
banish
to
Abbey
-
Mill
Farm
!
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
confine
to
the
society
of
the
illiterate
and
vulgar
all
your
life
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
the
young
man
could
have
the
assurance
to
ask
it
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
a
pretty
good
opinion
of
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
he
be
conceited
either
,
in
general
,
"
say
Harriet
,
<EOS>
her
conscience
oppose
such
censure
;
"
at
least
,
he
be
very
good
natured
,
and
I
shall
always
feel
much
oblige
to
him
,
and
have
a
great
regard
for
 
<EOS>
but
that
be
quite
a
different
thing
from
 
<EOS>
and
you
know
,
though
he
may
like
me
,
it
do
not
follow
that
I
should
 
<EOS>
and
certainly
I
must
confess
that
since
my
visiting
here
I
have
see
people
 
and
if
one
come
to
compare
them
,
person
and
manner
,
there
be
no
comparison
at
all
<EOS>
,
_
one
_
be
so
very
handsome
and
agreeable
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
do
really
think
Mr.
Martin
a
very
amiable
young
man
,
and
have
a
great
opinion
of
him
;
and
his
be
so
much
attach
to
me
 
and
his
writing
such
a
letter
 
<EOS>
but
as
to
leave
you
,
it
be
what
I
would
not
do
upon
any
consideration
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
thank
you
,
my
own
sweet
little
friend
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
be
part
.
<EOS>
a
woman
be
not
to
marry
a
man
merely
because
she
be
ask
,
or
because
he
be
attach
to
her
,
and
can
write
a
tolerable
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
no
;
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
<EOS>
but
a
short
letter
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
feel
the
bad
taste
of
her
friend
,
but
let
it
pass
with
a
"
very
true
;
and
it
would
be
a
small
consolation
to
her
,
for
the
clownish
manner
which
may
be
offend
her
every
hour
of
the
day
,
to
know
that
her
husband
could
write
a
good
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
very
.
<EOS>
nobody
care
for
a
letter
;
the
thing
be
,
to
be
always
happy
with
pleasant
companion
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
determined
to
refuse
him
.
<EOS>
but
how
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
what
shall
I
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
assure
her
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
the
answer
,
and
advise
its
be
write
directly
,
which
be
agree
to
,
in
the
hope
of
her
assistance
;
and
though
Emma
continue
to
protest
against
any
assistance
be
want
,
it
be
in
fact
give
in
the
formation
of
every
sentence
.
<EOS>
the
look
over
his
letter
again
,
in
reply
to
it
,
have
such
a
soften
tendency
,
that
it
be
particularly
necessary
to
brace
her
up
with
a
few
decisive
expression
;
and
she
be
so
very
much
concerned
at
the
idea
of
make
him
unhappy
,
and
think
so
much
of
what
his
mother
and
sister
would
think
and
say
,
and
be
so
anxious
that
they
should
not
fancy
her
ungrateful
,
that
Emma
believe
if
the
young
man
have
come
in
her
way
at
that
moment
,
he
would
have
be
accept
after
all
.
  
<EOS>
this
letter
,
however
,
be
write
,
and
seal
,
and
send
.
<EOS>
the
business
be
finish
,
and
Harriet
safe
.
<EOS>
She
be
rather
low
all
the
evening
,
but
Emma
could
allow
for
her
amiable
regret
,
and
sometimes
relieve
them
by
speak
of
her
own
affection
,
sometimes
by
bring
forward
the
idea
of
Mr.
Elton
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
be
invite
to
Abbey
-
Mill
again
,
"
be
say
in
rather
a
sorrowful
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
nor
,
if
you
be
,
could
I
ever
bear
to
part
with
you
,
my
harriet
.
<EOS>
You
be
a
great
deal
too
necessary
at
Hartfield
to
be
spare
to
Abbey
-
Mill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
be
sure
I
should
never
want
to
go
there
;
for
I
be
never
happy
but
at
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
some
time
afterwards
it
be
,
"
I
think
Mrs.
Goddard
would
be
very
much
surprize
if
she
know
what
have
happen
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
Miss
Nash
would
 
for
Miss
Nash
think
her
own
sister
very
well
married
,
and
it
be
only
a
linen
-
draper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
one
should
be
sorry
to
see
great
pride
or
refinement
in
the
teacher
of
a
school
,
Harriet
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
Miss
Nash
would
envy
you
such
an
opportunity
as
this
of
be
marry
.
<EOS>
even
this
conquest
would
appear
valuable
in
her
eye
.
<EOS>
as
to
any
thing
superior
for
you
,
I
suppose
she
be
quite
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
the
attention
of
a
certain
person
can
hardly
be
among
the
tittle
-
tattle
of
Highbury
yet
.
<EOS>
hitherto
<EOS>
I
fancy
you
<EOS>
and
I
be
the
only
people
to
whom
his
look
and
manner
have
explain
themselves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
blush
and
smile
,
and
say
something
about
wonder
that
people
should
like
her
so
much
.
<EOS>
the
idea
of
Mr.
Elton
be
certainly
cheer
;
but
still
,
after
a
time
,
she
be
tender
-
hearted
again
towards
the
reject
Mr.
Martin
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
he
have
get
my
letter
,
"
say
she
softly
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
they
be
all
do
 
whether
his
sister
know
 
if
he
be
unhappy
,
they
will
be
unhappy
too
.
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
not
mind
it
so
very
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
us
think
of
those
among
our
absent
friend
who
be
more
cheerfully
employ
,
"
cry
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
at
this
moment
,
perhaps
,
Mr.
Elton
be
shew
your
picture
to
his
mother
and
sister
,
tell
how
much
more
beautiful
be
the
original
,
and
after
be
ask
for
it
five
or
six
time
,
allow
them
to
hear
your
name
,
your
own
dear
name

my

he
so
!
 
<EOS>
then
I
know
nothing
of
Mr.

<EOS>
no
,
my
dear
little
modest
Harriet
,
depend
upon
it
the
picture
will
not
be
in
bond
-
street
till
just
before
he
mount
his
horse
to

morrow
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
companion
all
this
evening
,
his
solace
,
his
delight

<EOS>
It
open
his
design
to
his
family

it
introduce
you
among
them

it
diffuse
through
the
party
those
pleasantest
feeling
of
our
nature
,
eager
curiosity
and
warm
prepossession

how
cheerful

how
animate

<EOS>
Harriet
smile
again
,
and
her
smile
grow
strong
.
    
<EOS>
Harriet
sleep
at
Hartfield
that
night
.
<EOS>
for
some
week
past
she
have
be
spend
more
than
half
her
time
there
,
and
gradually
get
to
have
a
bed
-
room
appropriate
to
herself
;
and
Emma
judge
it
best
in
every
respect
,
safe
and
kind
,
to
keep
her
with
them
as
much
as
possible
just
at
present
.
<EOS>
She
be
oblige
to
go
the
next
morning
for
an
hour
or
two
to
Mrs.
Goddard
's
,
but
it
be
then
to
be
settle
that
she
should
return
to
Hartfield
,
to
make
a
regular
visit
of
some
day
.
  
<EOS>
while
she
be
go
,
Mr.

call
,
and
sit
some
time
with
Mr.

Emma

till
Mr.

,
who
have
previously
make
up
his
mind
to
walk
out
,
be
persuade
by
his
daughter
not
to
defer
it
,
and
be
induce
by
the
entreaty
of
both
,
though
against
the
scruple
of
his

civility

to
leave
Mr.

for
that
purpose

Mr.
Knightley
,
who
have
nothing
of
ceremony
about
him
,
be
offer
by
his
short
,
decide
answer
,
an
amusing
contrast
to
the
protract
apology
and
civil
hesitation
of
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
I
believe
,
if
you
will
excuse
me
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
if
you
will
not
consider
me
as
do
a
very
rude
thing
,
I
shall
take
Emma
's
advice
and
go
out
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
<EOS>
as
the
sun
be
out
,
I
believe
I
have
better
take
my
three
turn
while
I
can

<EOS>
I
treat
you
without

Mr.

my

You

I
would
ask
for
the
pleasure
of
your
company

Mr.
Knightley

I
be
a
very
slow
walker
,
and
my
pace
would
be
tedious
to
you

besides

you
have
another
long
walk
before

to
Donwell
Abbey

last
be
off

but
Mr.

,
instead
of
be
immediately
off
likewise
,
sit
down
again

seemingly
incline
for
more
chat

<EOS>
He
begin
speak
of
Harriet
,
and
speak
of
her
with
more
voluntary
praise
than
Emma
have
ever
hear
before

<EOS>
"
I
can
not
rate
her
beauty
as
you
do
,
"
say
he
;
"
but
she
be
a
pretty
little
creature
,
and
I
be
inclined
to
think
very
well
of
her
disposition

<EOS>
Her
character
depend
upon
those
she
be
with

in
good

out
a
valuable

I
be

therefore
say
nothing

He
presently
add
,
with
a
smile
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

<EOS>
Emma
be
more
than
half
in
hope
of
Mr.
Elton

<EOS>
have
dropt
a
hint
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
be
a
sort
of
general
friend
and
adviser
,
and
she
know
Mr.
Elton
look
up
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
reason
to
think
,
"
he
reply
,
"
that
Harriet
Smith
will
soon
have
an
offer
of
marriage
,
and
from
a
most
unexceptionable
quarter
:
 
<EOS>
Robert
Martin
be
the
man
.
<EOS>
Her
visit
to
Abbey
-
Mill
,
this
summer
,
seem
to
have
do
his
business
.
<EOS>
He
be
desperately
in
love
and
mean
to
marry
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
very
obliging
,
"
say
Emma
;
"
but
be
he
sure
that
Harriet
mean
to
marry
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
mean
to
make
her
an
offer
then
.
<EOS>
Will
that
do
?
<EOS>
He
come
to
the
Abbey
two
evening
ago
,
on
purpose
to
consult
me
about
it
.
<EOS>
He
know
I
have
a
thorough
regard
for
him
and
all
his
family
,
and
,
I
believe
,
consider
me
as
one
of
his
good
friend
.
<EOS>
He
come
to
ask
me
whether
I
think
it
would
be
imprudent
in
him
to
settle
so
early
;
whether
I
think
her
too
young
:
in
short
,
whether
I
approve
his
choice
altogether
;
have
some
apprehension
perhaps
of
her
be
consider
(
especially
since
_
your
_
make
so
much
of
her
)
as
in
a
line
of
society
above
him
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
pleased
with
all
that
he
say
.
<EOS>
I
never
hear
well
sense
from
any
one
than
Robert
Martin
.
<EOS>
He
always
speak
to
the
purpose
;
open
,
straightforward
,
and
very
well
judge
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
every
thing
;
his
circumstance
and
plan
,
and
what
they
all
propose
do
in
the
event
of
his
marriage
.
<EOS>
He
be
an
excellent
young
man
,
both
as
son
and
brother
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
hesitation
in
advise
him
to
marry
.
<EOS>
He
prove
to
me
that
he
could
afford
it
;
and
that
be
the
case

I
be
convince
he
could
not
do
better
.
<EOS>
I
praise
the
fair
lady
too

altogether
send
him
away
very
happy
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
never
esteem
my
opinion
before
,
he
would
have
think
highly
of
me
then
;
and
,
I
dare
say
,
leave
the
house
think
me
the
good
friend

counsellor
man
ever
have
.
<EOS>
this
happen
the
night
before
last
.
<EOS>
now
,
as
we
may
fairly
suppose
,
he
would
not
allow
much
time
to
pass
before
he
speak
to
the
lady
,
and
as
he
do
not
appear
to
have
speak
yesterday
,
it
be
not
unlikely
that
he
should
be
at
Mrs.
Goddard
's
to
-
day
;
and
she
may
be
detain
by
a
visitor
,
without
think
him
at
all
a
tiresome
wretch
.
<EOS>
"

Pray
,
Mr.
Knightley

Emma

who
have

to

through

part
of
this

this

before

Mr.

with
surprize

displeasure

up

in
tall
indignation

about

<EOS>
"
oh

sure

cry
Emma
,
"
it
be
always
incomprehensible

Harriet

refuse

persuade

if
I
do
,
(
which
,
however

I
be
far
from
allow

I
should
not
feel
that
I
have
do
wrong

<EOS>
Mr.

be
a
very
respectable
young
man
,

I
can
not
admit
him
to
be
Harriet

equal
;
and
be
rather
surprized
indeed
that
he
should
have
venture
to
address
her
.
<EOS>
by
your
account
,
he
do
seem
to
have
have
some
scruple

<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
that
they
be
ever

over
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
Harriet

equal

"
exclaim
Mr.
Knightley
loudly
and
warmly
;
and
with
calm
asperity
,
add
,
a
few
moment
afterwards
,
"
no
,
he
be
not
her
equal
indeed
,
for
he
be
as
much
her
superior
in
sense
as
in
situation

<EOS>
emma
,
your
infatuation
about
that
girl
blind
you
.
<EOS>
what
be
Harriet
Smith
's
claim
,
either
of
birth
,
nature
or
education
,
to
any
connexion
high
than
Robert
Martin
?
<EOS>
She
be
the
natural
daughter
of
nobody
know
whom
,
with
probably
no
settle
provision
at
all
,
and
certainly
no
respectable
relation
.
<EOS>
She
be
know
only
as
parlour
-
boarder
at
a
common
school
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
a
sensible
girl
,
nor
a
girl
of
any
information
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
teach
nothing
useful
,
and
be
too
young
and
too
simple
to
have
acquire
any
thing
herself
.
<EOS>
at
her
age
she
can
have
no
experience
,
and
with
her
little
wit
,
be
not
very
likely
ever
to
have
any
that
can
avail
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
pretty
,
and
she
be
good
temper
,
and
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
My
only
scruple
in
advise
the
match
be
on
his
account
,
as
be
beneath
his
desert
,
and
a
bad
connexion
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
,
as
to
fortune
,
in
all
probability
he
may
do
much
well
;
and
that
as
to
a
rational
companion
or
useful
helpmate
,
he
could
not
do
bad
.
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
reason
so
to
a
man
in
love
,
and
be
willing
to
trust
to
there
be
no
harm
in
her
,
to
her
have
that
sort
of
disposition
,
which
,
in
good
hand
,
like
his
,
may
be
easily
lead
aright
and
turn
out
very
well
.
<EOS>
the
advantage
of
the
match
<EOS>
I
feel
to
be
all
on
her
side
;
and
have
not
the
small
doubt
(
nor
have
I
now
)
that
there
would
be
a
general
cry
-
out
upon
her
extreme
good
luck
.
<EOS>
even
_
<EOS>
your
_
satisfaction
I
make
sure
of
.
<EOS>
It
cross
my
mind
immediately
that
you
would
not
regret
your
friend
's
leave
Highbury
,
for
the
sake
of
her
be
settle
so
well
.
<EOS>
I
remember
say
to
myself
,
"
even
Emma
,
with
all
her
partiality
for
Harriet
,
will
think
this
a
good
match
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
can
not
help
wonder
at
your
knowing
so
little
of
Emma
as
to
say
any
such
thing
.
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
think
a
farmer
,
(
and
with
all
his
sense
and
all
his
merit
Mr.
Martin
be
nothing
more
,
)
a
good
match
for
my
intimate
friend
!
<EOS>
not
regret
her
leave
Highbury
for
the
sake
of
marry
a
man
whom
I
could
never
admit
as
an
acquaintance
of
my
own
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
you
should
think
it
possible
for
me
to
have
such
feeling
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
mine
be
very
different
.
<EOS>
I
must
think
your
statement
by
no
means
fair
.
<EOS>
You
be
not
just
to
Harriet
's
claim
.
<EOS>
They
would
be
estimate
very
differently
by
other
as
well
as
myself
;
Mr.
Martin
may
be
the
rich
of
the
two
,
but
he
be
undoubtedly
her
inferior
as
to
rank
in
society
.
 
<EOS>
the
sphere
in
which
she
move
be
much
above
his
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
degradation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
degradation
to
illegitimacy
and
ignorance
,
to
be
married
to
a
respectable
,
intelligent
gentleman
-
farmer
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
to
the
circumstance
of
her
birth
,
though
in
a
legal
sense
she
may
be
call
nobody
,
it
will
not
hold
in
common
sense
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
to
pay
for
the
offence
of
other
,
by
be
hold
below
the
level
of
those
with
whom
she
be
bring
up
.
 
<EOS>
there
can
scarcely
be
a
doubt
that
her
father
be
a
gentleman
 
and
a
gentleman
of
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
Her
allowance
be
very
liberal
;
nothing
have
ever

grudge
for
her
improvement
or
comfort

<EOS>
that
she
be
a
gentleman
's
daughter

be
indubitable
to
me

that
she

with
gentleman
's
daughter

no
one
,
I
apprehend
,
will
deny
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
superior
to
Mr.
Robert
Martin

"
  
<EOS>
"
whoever
may
be
her
parent
,
"
say
Mr.
Knightley
,
"
whoever
may
have
have
the
charge
of
her
,
it
do
not
appear
to
have
be
any
part
of
their
plan
to
introduce
her
into
what
you
would
call
good
society

<EOS>
after
receive
a
very
indifferent
education
she
be
leave
in
Mrs.
Goddard
's
hand
to
shift
as
she
can
;
 
to
move
,
in
short
,
in
Mrs.
Goddard
's
line
,
to
have
Mrs.
Goddard
's
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Her
friend
evidently
think
this
good
enough
for
her
;

it

be
_
good
enough

She
desire
nothing
well
herself

<EOS>
till
you
choose
to
turn
her
into
a
friend

her
mind
have
no
distaste
for
her
own
set
,
nor
any
ambition
beyond
it

She
be
as
happy
as
possible
with
the
Martins
in
the
summer
.

have
no
sense
of
superiority
then

she
have
it
now

you
have
give
it

<EOS>
You
have
be
no
friend

Harriet
Smith
,
Emma

<EOS>
Robert
Martin
would
never
have
proceed
so
far
,
if
he
have
not
feel
persuade
of
her
not
be
disincline
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
know
him
well

<EOS>
He
have
too
much
real
feeling
to
address
any
woman
on
the
haphazard
of
selfish
passion

as
to
conceit
,
he

the
farth

know

depend
upon
it

have
encouragement

"
  
<EOS>
It
be
most
convenient
to
Emma
not
to
make
a
direct
reply
to
this
assertion
;
she
choose
rather
to
take
up
her
own
line
of
the
subject
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
very
warm
friend
to
Mr.
Martin
;

,
as
I
say
before
,
be
unjust
to
Harriet

<EOS>
Harriet
's
claim
to
marry
well
be
not
so
contemptible
as
you
represent
them
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
a
clever
girl
,
but
she
have
well
sense
than
you
be
aware
of
,
and
do
not
deserve
to
have
her
understanding
speak
of
so
slightingly

<EOS>
waive
that
point
,
however
,
and
suppose
her
to
be
,
as
you
describe
her
,
only
pretty
and
good
-
natured
,
let
me
tell
you
,
that
in
the
degree
she
possess
them
,
they
be
not
trivial
recommendation
to
the
world
in
general
,
for
she
be
,
in
fact
,
a
beautiful
girl
,
and
must
be
think
so
by
ninety
-
nine
people
out
of
an
hundred
;
and
till
it
appear
that
man
be
much
more
philosophic
on
the
subject
of
beauty

generally
suppose

claim

upon

word

to
hear

Mr.

You
will

nothing

<EOS>
Miss
Harriet
Smith
may
not
find

of
marriage
flow
in
so
fast
,
though
she
be
a
very
pretty
girl

<EOS>
men
of
sense

whatever
you
may
chuse
to

do
not
want
silly
wife

<EOS>
man
of
family
would
not
be
very
fond
of
connect
themselves
with
a
girl
of
such
obscurity
 
and
most
prudent
man
would
be
afraid
of
the
inconvenience
and
disgrace
<EOS>
they
may
be
involve
in
,
when
the
mystery
of
her
parentage
come
to
be
reveal
.
<EOS>
let
her
marry
Robert
Martin
,
and
she
be
safe
,
respectable
,
and
happy
for
ever
;
but
if
you
encourage
her
to
expect
to
marry
greatly
,
and
teach
her
to
be
satisfied
with
nothing
less
than
a
man
of
consequence
and
large
fortune
,
she
may
be
a
parlour
-
boarder
at
Mrs.
Goddard
's
all
the
rest
of
her
life
 
or
,
at
least
,
(
for
Harriet
Smith

a
girl
who
will
marry
somebody
or

)
till
she

desperate

be
glad

catch
at

We
think
so
very
differently
on
this
point
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
that
there
can
be
no
use
in
canvass
it

<EOS>
We
shall
only
be
make
each

more
angry

as
to
my
_

_
her
marry
Robert
Martin
,
it
be
impossible
;
she
have
refuse
him
,
and
so
decidedly
,
I
think
,
as
must
prevent
any
second
application

<EOS>
She
must
abide
by
the
evil
of
have
refuse
him
,
whatever
it
may
be
;

as
to
the
refusal
itself
,
I
will
not
pretend
to
say
that
I
may
not
influence
her
a
little
;
but
I
assure
you
there
be
very
little
for
me
or
for
any
body
to
do
.
<EOS>
His
appearance
be
so
much
against
him
,
and
his
manner
so
bad
,
that
if
she
ever
be
dispose
to
favour
him
,
she
be
not
now
.
<EOS>
I
can
imagine
,
that
before
she
have
see
any
body
superior
,
she
may
tolerate
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
brother
of
her
friend
,
and
he
take
pain
to
please
her
;
and
altogether
,
have
see
nobody
better
(
that
must
have
be
his
great
assistant
)
<EOS>
she
may
not
,
while
she
be
at
Abbey
-
Mill
,
find
him
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
but
the
case
be
alter
now
.
<EOS>
She
know
now
what
gentleman
be
;
and
nothing
but
a
gentleman
in
education
and
manner
have
any
chance
with
Harriet
.
<EOS>
"

nonsense
,
errant
nonsense

as
ever

talk

Mr.
Knightley

<EOS>
"
Robert
Martin
's
manner
have
sense
,
sincerity
,
and
good
-
humour
to
recommend
them
;
and
his
mind
have
more
true
gentility
than
Harriet
Smith
could
understand
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
make
no
answer
,
and
try
to
look
cheerfully
unconcerned
,
but
be
really
feel
uncomfortable
and
want
him
very
much
to
be
go
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
repent
what
she
have
do
;
she
still
think
herself
a
well
judge
of
such
a
point
of
female
right
and
refinement
than
he
could
be
;
but
yet
she
have
a
sort
of
habitual
respect
for
his
judgment
in
general
,
which
make
her
dislike
have
it
so
loudly
against
her
;
and
to
have
him
sit
just
opposite
to
her
in
angry
state
,
be
very
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
some
minute
pass
in
this
unpleasant
silence
,
with
only
one
attempt
on
Emma
's
side
to
talk
of
the
weather
,
but
he
make
no
answer
.
<EOS>
He
be
think
.
<EOS>
the
result
of
his
thought
appear
at
last
in
these
word

<EOS>
"
Robert
Martin
have
no
great
loss
 
if
he
can
but
think
so
;
and
I
hope
it
will
not
be
long
before
he
do
.
<EOS>
Your
view
for
Harriet
be
best
known
to
yourself
;
but
as
you
make
no
secret
of
your
love
of
match
-
making
,
it
be
fair
to
suppose
that
view
,
and
plan
,
and
project
you
have
;
 
and
as
a
friend
I
shall
just
hint
to
you
that
if
Elton
be
the
man
,
I
think
it
will
be
all
labour
in
vain
.

"
  
<EOS>
Emma
laugh
and
disclaim
.
<EOS>
He
continue
,
  
<EOS>
"
depend
upon
it
,
Elton
will
not
do
.
<EOS>
Elton
be
a
very
good
sort
of
man
,
and
a
very
respectable
vicar
of
Highbury
,
but
not
at
all
likely
to
make
an
imprudent
match
.
<EOS>
He
know
the
value
of
a
good
income
as
well
as
any
body
.
<EOS>
Elton
may
talk
sentimentally
,
but
he
will
act
rationally
.
<EOS>
He
be
as
well
acquaint
with
his
own
claim
,
as
you
can
be
with
Harriet
's
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
be
a
very
handsome
young
man
,
and
a
great
favourite
wherever
he
go
;
and
from
his
general
way
of
talk
in
unreserved
moment
,
when
there
be
only
man
present
,
I
be
convinced
that
he
do
not
mean
to
throw
himself
away
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
him
speak
with
great
animation
of
a
large
family
of
young
lady
that
his
sister
be
intimate
with
,
who
have
all
twenty
thousand
pound
apiece

<EOS>
"
I

very
much
oblige

"
if
I
have
set
my
heart
on
Mr.
Elton

marry
Harriet

it
would
have
be
very
kind
to
open
my
eye
;
but
at
present
I
only
want
to
keep
Harriet
to
myself
.
<EOS>
I
have
do
with
match
-
making
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
could
never
hope
to
equal
my
own
doing
at
randall
.
<EOS>
I
shall
leave
off
while
I
be
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
morning
to
you
,
"
 
say
he
,
rise
and
walk
off
abruptly
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
much
vexed
.
<EOS>
He
feel
the
disappointment
of
the
young
man
,
and
be
mortify
to
have
be
the
mean
of
promote
it
,
by
the
sanction
he
have
give
;
and
the
part
which
he
be
persuade
Emma
have
take
in
the
affair
,
be
provoke
him
exceedingly
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
remain
in
a
state
of
vexation
too
;
but
there
be
more
indistinctness
in
the
cause
of
her
's
,
than
in
his
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
always
feel
so
absolutely
satisfied
with
herself
,
so
entirely
convinced
that
her
opinion
be
right
and
her
adversary
's
wrong
,
as
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
He
walk
off
in
more
complete
self
-
approbation
than
he
leave
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
so
materially
cast
down
,
however
,
but
that
a
little
time
and
the
return
of
Harriet
be
very
adequate
restorative
.
<EOS>
Harriet
's
stay
away
so
long
be
begin
to
make
her
uneasy
.
<EOS>
the
possibility
of
the
young
man
be
come
to
Mrs.
Goddard
's
that
morning
,
and
meet
with
Harriet
and
plead
his
own
cause
,
give
alarm
idea
.
<EOS>
the
dread
of
such
a
failure
after
all
become
the
prominent
uneasiness
;
and
when
Harriet
appear
,
and
in
very
good
spirit
,
and
without
have
any
such
reason
to
give
for
her
long
absence
<EOS>
,
she
feel
a
satisfaction
which
settle
her
with
her
own
mind
,
and
convince
her
,
that
let
Mr.
Knightley
think
or
say
what
he
would
,
she
have
do
nothing
which
woman
's
friendship
and
woman
's
feeling
would
not
justify
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
frighten
her
a
little
about
Mr.
Elton
;
but
when
she
consider
that
Mr.
Knightley
could
not
have
observe
him
as
she
have
do
,
neither
with
the
interest
,
nor
(
she
must
be
allow
to
tell
herself
,
in
spite
of
Mr.
Knightley
's
pretension
)
with
the
skill
of
such
an
observer
on
such
a
question
as
herself
,
that
he
have
speak
it
hastily
and
in
anger
,
she
be
able
to
believe
,
that
he
have
rather
say
what
he
wish
resentfully
to
be
true
,
than
what
he
know
any
thing
about
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
may
have
hear
Mr.
Elton
speak
with
more
unreserve
than
she
have
ever
do
,
and
Mr.
Elton
may
not
be
of
an
imprudent
,
inconsiderate
disposition
as
to
money
matter
;
he
may
naturally
be
rather
attentive
than
otherwise
to
them
;
but
then
,
Mr.
Knightley
do
not
make
due
allowance
for
the
influence
of
a
strong
passion
at
war
with
all
interested
motive
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
see
no
such
passion
,
and
of
course
think
nothing
of
its
effect
;
but
she
see
too
much
of
it
to
feel
a
doubt
of
its
overcoming
any
hesitation
that
a
reasonable
prudence
may
originally
suggest
;
and
more
than
a
reasonable
,
become
degree
of
prudence
,
she
be
very
sure
do
not
belong
to
Mr.
Elton
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
's
cheerful
look
and
manner
establish
her
<EOS>
:
she
come
back
,
not
to
think
of
Mr.
Martin
,
but
to
talk
of
Mr.
Elton
.
<EOS>
Miss
Nash
have
be
tell
her
something
,
which
she
repeat
immediately
with
great
delight
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Perry
have
be
to
Mrs.
Goddard
's
to
attend
a
sick
child
,
and
Miss
Nash
have
see
him
,
and
he
have
tell
Miss
Nash
,
that
as
he
be
come
back
yesterday
from
Clayton
Park
,
he
have
meet
Mr.
Elton
,
and
find
to
his
great
surprize
,
that
Mr.
Elton
be
actually
on
his
road
to
London
,
and
not
mean
to
return
till
the
morrow
,
though
it
be
the
whist
-
club
night
,
which
he
have
be
never
know
to
miss
before
;
and
Mr.
Perry
have
remonstrate
with
him
about
it
,
and
tell
him
how
shabby
it
be
in
him
,
their
good
player
,
to
absent
himself
,
and
try
very
much
to
persuade
him
to
put
off
his
journey
only
one
day
;
but
it
would
not
do
;
Mr.
Elton
have
be
determine
to
go
on
,
and
have
say
in
a
_
<EOS>
very
_
_
particular
_
way
indeed
,
that
he
be
go
on
business
which
he
would
not
put
off
for
any
inducement
in
the
world
;
and
something
about
a
very
enviable
commission
,
and
be
the
bearer
of
something
exceedingly
precious
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Perry
could
not
quite
understand
him
,
but
he
be
very
sure
there
must
be
a
_
lady
_
in
the
case
,
and
he
tell
him
so
;
and
Mr.
Elton
only
look
very
conscious
and
smile
,
and
ride
off
in
great
spirit
.
<EOS>
Miss
Nash
have
tell
her
all
this
,
and
have
talk
a
great
deal
more
about
Mr.
Elton
;
and
say
,
look
so
very
significantly
at
her
,
"
that
she
do
not
pretend
to
understand
what
his
business
may
be
,
but
she
only
know
that
any
woman
whom
Mr.
Elton
could
prefer
,
she
should
think
the
lucky
woman
in
the
world
;
for
,
beyond
a
doubt
,
Mr.
Elton
have
not
his
equal
for
beauty
or
agreeableness
.
"
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
may
quarrel
with
her
,
but
Emma
could
not
quarrel
with
herself
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
much
displeased
,
that
it
be
long
than
usual
before
he
come
to
Hartfield
again
;
and
when
they
do
meet
,
his
grave
look
shew
that
she
be
not
forgive
.
<EOS>
She
be
sorry
,
but
could
not
repent
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
her
plan
and
proceeding
be
more
and
more
justified
and
endear
to
her
by
the
general
appearance
of
the
next
few
day
.
  
<EOS>
the
Picture

come
safely
to
hand
soon
after
Mr.
Elton
's
return
,
and
be
hang
over
the
mantelpiece
of
the
common
sitting
-
room
,
he
get
up
to
look
at
it
,
and
sigh
out
his
half
sentence
of
admiration
just
as
he
ought
;
and
as
for
Harriet
's
feeling
,
they
be
visibly
form
themselves
into
as
strong
and
steady
an
attachment
as
her
youth
and
sort
of
mind
admit
.
<EOS>
Emma
be
soon
perfectly
satisfied
of
Mr.
Martin
's
be
no
otherwise
remember
,
than
as
he
furnish
a
contrast
with
Mr.
Elton
,
of
the
utmost
advantage
to
the
latter

Her
view
of
improve
her
little
friend
's
mind

by
a
great
deal
of
useful
reading
and
conversation

never
yet
lead
to
more
than
a
few
first
chapter
,
and
the
intention
of
go
on
to
-
morrow

<EOS>
It
be
much
easy
to
chat
than
to
study
;
much
pleasanter
to
let
her
imagination
range
and
work
at
Harriet
's
fortune
,
than
to
be
labour
to
enlarge
her
comprehension
or
exercise
it
on
sober
fact
;
and
the
only
literary
pursuit
which
engage
Harriet
at
present

the
only
mental
provision
she
be

thin
quarto
of
hot

pressed
paper

make
up
by
her
friend

and
ornament
with

<EOS>
in
this
age
of
literature
,
such
collection
on
a
very
grand
scale

not
uncommon

Miss
Nash

teacher
at
Mrs.
Goddard

as
Harriet

pretty

it
be
likely
to
be
an
arrangement
of
the
first
order

in
form
as
well
as
quantity

<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
be
almost
as
much

His

not

any

desire
Perry
to
be
upon

go
about
so
much

something
<EOS>
,
he
think

may
come
from

quarter

<EOS>
It
be
by
no
means
his
daughter

wish
that
the
intellect
of
Highbury
in
general
should
be
put
under
requisition

<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
be
the
only
one
whose
assistance
she
ask
.
<EOS>
He
be
invite
to
contribute
any
really
good
enigmas
,
charade
,
or
conundrum
that
he
may
recollect
;
and
she
have
the
pleasure
of
see
him
most
intently
at
work
with
his
recollection
;
and
at
the
same
time

as
she
could
perceive
,
most
earnestly
careful
that
nothing
ungallant
,
nothing
that
do
not
breathe
a
compliment
to
the
sex
should
pass
his
lip
.
<EOS>
They
owe
to
him
their
two
or
three
politest
puzzle
;
and
the
joy
and
exultation
with
which
at
last
he
recall
,
and
rather
sentimentally
recite
,
that
well
-
know
charade
,
  
My
first
doth
affliction
denote
,
which
my
second
be
destin'd
to
feel

my
whole
be
the
good
antidote

that
affliction
to
soften

heal

<EOS>
make
her
quite
sorry
to
acknowledge
that
they

transcribe
it
some

"
why

she

all

Harriet

when

It

It

when

they

out
of

be
equal

there
do
seem
to
be
a
something
in
the
air
of
Hartfield
which
give
love
exactly
the

send
it
into
the

good

They

the

its

Harriet
submit
,
though
her
mind
could
hardly
separate
the
part

so
as
to
feel
quite
sure
that

down
a
declaration
of

too
precious

grave

<EOS>
"
My
dear
Harriet
,
you
must
not
refine
too
much
upon
this
charade
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
betray
your
feeling
improperly
,
if
you
be
too
conscious

too
quick
,
and
appear
to
affix
more
meaning
,

even
quite
all
the
meaning
which
may
be
affix
to
it
.
<EOS>
do
not
be
overpower
by
such
a
little
tribute
of
admiration

<EOS>
if
he
have
be
anxious
for
secrecy
,
he
would
not
have
leave
the
paper
while
I
be
by

he
rather
push
it
towards
me
than
towards
you

<EOS>
do
not
let
us
be
too
solemn
on
the
business

He
have
encouragement
enough
to
proceed

without
our
sigh
out
our
soul
over
this
charade

"
oh

no

Mr.
Woodhouse
come
in

very
soon
lead
to
the
subject
again
,
by
the
recurrence
of
his
very
frequent
inquiry
of
"
well
,
my
dear
,
how
do
your
book
go
on
?
 
<EOS>
have
you
get
any
thing
fresh

<EOS>
"
yes

papa

we
have
something
to
read
you

something
quite
fresh

a
piece
of
paper

dropt

a
very
pretty
charade

we
have
just
copy
it
in

<EOS>
She
read
it
to
him

just
as

like
to

slowly

distinctly

two

three

over

with
explanation

as

have
foresee

with
the
complimentary
conclusion

aye

that
be

It

such
a
pretty

my

I
can
easily
guess
what
fairy
bring
it

nobody
could
have
write
so
prettily

you

Emma
only
nod
,
and
smile

after
a
little
thinking

a
very
tender
sigh

he
add
,
  
"

ah
!

it
be
no
difficulty

Your

so
clever
at
all

thing

if
I
have

her
memory

I
can
remember
nothing

not
even
that
particular
riddle

you
have
hear
me
mention

I
can
only
recollect
the
first
stanza

there
be
several

Kitty

a
fair

frozen

Kindled
a
flame

deplore

the
hood

wink'd
boy

call
to

though
of
his
near
approach
afraid

so
fatal
to
my
suit

that
be
all
that
I
can
recollect
of
it

it
be
very
clever

I

,
my

you
say
you
have
get
it
.

"
  
"
yes

papa
,
it
be
write
out
in

very
near

christen
Catherine

her
grandmama

I
hope
we
shall
have
her
here
next
week

<EOS>
have
you
think

my

where
you
shall
put
her

what
room
there
will
be
for
the
child

<EOS>

"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
 
she
will
have
her
own
room
,
of
course
;
the
room
she
always
have
;
 
and
there
be
the
nursery
for
the
child
,
 
just
as
usual
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
why
should
there
be
any
change
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
my
dear
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
so
long
since
she
be
here
!
 
<EOS>
not
since
last
Easter
,
and
then
only
for
a
few
day

Mr.

she
be
sadly
take
away
from
us
all

how
sorry
she
will
be
<EOS>
when
she
come
,
not
to
see
Miss
Taylor
here
!

"
  
<EOS>

She
will
not
be
surprize

papa
,
at
least
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
<EOS>
my
dear

<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
be
very
much
surprize
when
I
first
hear
she
be
go
to
be
marry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
ask
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
to
dine
with
us
,
while
Isabella
be
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
my
dear
,
if
there
be
time
.
 
<EOS>
but
 
(
in
a
very
depressed
tone
)
 
<EOS>
she
be
come
for
only
one
week
.
<EOS>
there
will
not
be
time
for
any
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
unfortunate
that
they
can
not
stay
longer
 
<EOS>
but
it
seem
a
case
of
necessity
.
<EOS>
Mr.
John
Knightley
must
be
in
town
again
on
the
28th
,
and
we
ought
to
be
thankful
,
papa
,
that
we
be
to
have
the
whole
of
the
time
they
can
give
to
the
country
,
that
two
or
three
day
be
not
to
be
take
out
for
the
Abbey
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
promise
to
give
up
his
claim
this
Christmas
 
though
you
know
it
be
long
since
they
be
with
him
,
than
with
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
very
hard
,
indeed
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
if
poor
Isabella
be
to
be
anywhere
but
at
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
could
never
allow
for
Mr.
Knightley
's
claim
on
his
brother
,
or
any
body
's
claim
on
Isabella
,
except
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
sit
muse
a
little
while
,
and
then
say
,
  
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
see
why
poor
Isabella
should
be
oblige
to
go
back
so
soon
,
though
he
do
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
Emma
,
I
shall
try
and
persuade
her
to
stay
longer
with
us
.
<EOS>
She
and
the
child
may
stay
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
papa
 
<EOS>
that
be
what
you
never
have
be
able
to
accomplish
,
and
I
do
not
think
you
ever
will
.
<EOS>
Isabella
can
not
bear
to
stay
behind
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
too
true
for
contradiction
.
<EOS>
Unwelcome
as
it
be
,
Mr.
Woodhouse
could
only
give
a
submissive
sigh
;
and
as
Emma
see
his
spirit
affect
by
the
idea
of
his
daughter
's
attachment
to
her
husband
,
she
immediately
lead
to
such
a
branch
of
the
subject
as
must
raise
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Harriet
must
give
us
as
much
of
her
company
as
she
can
while
my
brother
and
sister
be
here
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
she
will
be
pleased
with
the
child

<EOS>
We
be
very
proud
of
the
child
,
be
not
we
,
papa
?
<EOS>
I
wonder
which
she
will
think
the
handsome
,
Henry
or
John
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
aye
,
I
wonder
which
she
will
.
<EOS>
poor
little
dear
,
how
glad
they
will
be
to
come
.
<EOS>
They
be
very
fond
of
be
at
Hartfield

Harriet

I
dare
say
they
be
,
sir

I
be
sure
I
do
not
know
who
be
not

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Henry
be
a
fine
boy
,
but
John
be
very
like
his
mama
.
<EOS>
Henry
be
the
eld
,
he
be
name
after
me
,
not
after
his
father
.
<EOS>
John
,
the
second
,
be
name
after
his
father
.
<EOS>
some
people
be
surprize
,
I
believe
,
that
the
eld
be
not
,
but
Isabella
would
have
him
call
Henry
,
<EOS>
which
I
think
very
pretty
of
her
.
<EOS>
and
he
be
a
very
clever
boy
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
remarkably
clever
;
and
they
have
so
many
pretty
way
.
<EOS>
They
will
come
and
stand
by
my
chair
,
and
say
,
"
Grandpapa
,
can
you
give
me
a
bit
of
string
?
"
<EOS>
and
once
Henry
ask
me
for
a
knife
,
but
I
tell
him
knife
be
only
make
for
grandpapa
.
<EOS>
I
think
their
father
be
too
rough
with
them
very
often
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
appear
rough
to
you
,
"
say
Emma
,
"
because
you
be
so
very
gentle
yourself
;
but
if
you
could
compare
him
with
other
papa
,
you
would
not
think
him
rough
.
<EOS>
He
wish
his
boy
to
be
active
and
hardy
;
and
if
they
misbehave
,
can
give
them
a
sharp
word
now
and
then
;
but
he
be
an
affectionate
father
 
certainly
Mr.
John
Knightley
be
an
affectionate
father
.
<EOS>
the
child
be
all
fond
of
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
then
their
uncle
come
in
,
and
toss
them
up
to
the
ceiling
in
a
very
frightful
way
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
they
like
it
,
papa
;
there
be
nothing
they
like
so
much
.
<EOS>
It
be
such
enjoyment
to
them
,
that
if
their
uncle
do
not
lay
down
the
rule
of
their
taking
turn
,
whichever
begin
would
never
give
way
to
the
other

<EOS>
"
well
,
I
can
not
understand
it
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
that
be
the
case
with
us
all
,
papa
.
<EOS>
one
half
of
the
world
can
not
understand
the
pleasure
of
the
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
later
in
the
morning
,
and
just
as
the
girl
be
go
to
separate
in
preparation
for
the
regular
four
o'clock
dinner
,
the
hero
of
this
inimitable
charade
walk
in
again
.
<EOS>
Harriet
turn
away
;
but
Emma
could
receive
him
with
the
usual
smile
,
and
her
quick
eye
soon
discern
in
his
the
consciousness
of
have
make
a
push
 
of
have
throw
a
die
;
and
she
imagine
he
be
come
to
see
how
it
may
turn
up
.
<EOS>
His
ostensible
reason
,
however
,
be
to
ask
whether
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
party
could
be
make
up
in
the
evening
without
him
,
or
whether
he
should
be
in
the
small
degree
necessary
at
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
,
every
thing
else
must
give
way
;
but
otherwise
his
friend
Cole
have
be
say
so
much
about
his
dining
with
him
 
have
make
such
a
point
of
it
,
that
he
have
promise
him
conditionally
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
thank
him
,
but
could
not
allow
of
his
disappoint
his
friend
on
their
account
;
her
father
be
sure
of
his
rubber
.
<EOS>
He
re
-
urge
 
she
re
-
decline
;
and
he
seem
then
about
to
make
his
bow
,
when
take
the
paper
from
the
table
,
she
return
it
    
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
here
be
the
charade
you
be
so
obliging
as
to
leave
with
us
;
thank
you
for
the
sight
of
it
.
<EOS>
We
admire
it
so
much
,
that
I
have
venture
to
write
it
into
Miss
Smith
's
collection
.
<EOS>
Your
friend
will
not
take
it
<EOS>
amiss
<EOS>
I
hope
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
have
not
transcribe
beyond
the
first
eight
line
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
certainly
do
not
very
well
know
what
to
say
.
<EOS>
He
look
rather
doubtingly
 
rather
confused
;
say
something
about
"
honour
,
"
 
glance
at
Emma
and
at
Harriet
,
and
then
see
the
book
open
on
the
table
,
take
it
up
,
and
examine
it
very
attentively
.
<EOS>
with
the
view
of
pass
off
an
awkward
moment
,
Emma
smilingly
say
,
  
"
You
must
make
my
apology
to
your
friend
;
but
so
good
a
charade
must
not
be
confine
to
one
or
two
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
sure
of
every
woman
's
approbation
while
he
write
with
such
gallantry

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
hesitation
in
say
,

reply
Mr.
Elton
,
though
hesitate
a
good
deal
while
he
speak
;

I
have
no
hesitation
in
say

feel
at
all

I
have
not
the

honour
as

I
_
see
it
,
(
look
at
the
book
again

replace
it

he
would
consider
it
as
the
proud
moment

his

after
this
speech
he
be
go
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Emma
could
not
think
it
too
soon
;
for
with
all
his
good
and
agreeable
quality
,
there
be
a
sort
of
parade
in
his
speech
which
be
very
apt
to
incline
her
to
laugh
.
<EOS>
She
run
away
to
indulge
the
inclination
,
leave
the
tender
and
the
sublime
of
pleasure
to
Harriet
's
share
.
    
<EOS>
though
now
the
middle
of
December
,
there
have
yet
be
no
weather
to
prevent
the
young
lady
from
tolerably
regular
exercise
;
and
on
the
morrow
,
Emma
have
a
charitable
visit
to
pay
to
a
poor
sick
family
,
who
live
a
little
way
out
of
Highbury
.
  
<EOS>
Their
road
to
this
detached
cottage
be
down
Vicarage
Lane
,
a
lane
lead
at
right
angle
from
the
broad
,
though
irregular
,
main
street
of
the
place
;
and
,
as
may
be
infer
,
contain
the
bless
abode
of
Mr.
Elton
.
<EOS>
a
few
inferior
dwelling
be
first
to
be
pass
,
and
then
,
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
down
the
lane
rise
the
Vicarage
,
an
old
and
not
very
good
house
,
almost
as
close
to
the
road
as
it
could
be
.
<EOS>
It
have
no
advantage
of
situation
;
but
have
be
very
much
smartene
up
by
the
present
proprietor
;
and
,
such
as
it
be
,
there
could
be
no
possibility
of
the
two
friend
pass
it
without
a
slacken
pace
and
observe
eye
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
's
remark
be
    
<EOS>
"
there
it
be

<EOS>
there
go
you
and
your

one
of

Harriet

what
a

how

Miss

I

Emma

proceed
,

_
then
_
there
will
be
an
inducement

I
shall
gradually
get
intimately
acquaint
with
all
the
hedge

gate
,
pool
and
pollard
of
this
part
of
Highbury

"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
,
she
find
,
have
never
in
her
life
be
within
side
the
Vicarage
,
and
her
curiosity
to
see
it
be
so
extreme
,
that
,
consider
exterior
and
probability
,
Emma
could
only
class
it
,
as
a
proof
of
love
,
with
Mr.
Elton
's
see
ready
wit
in
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
we
could
contrive
it
,
"
say
she
;
<EOS>
"
but
I
can
not
think
of
any
tolerable
pretence
for
go
in
;
 
no
servant
that
I
want
to
inquire
about
of
his
housekeeper
 
<EOS>
no
message
from
my
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
ponder
,
but
could
think
of
nothing
.
<EOS>
after
a
mutual
silence
of
some
minute
,
Harriet
thus
begin
again
    
"
I
do
so
wonder
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
that
you
should
not
be
married
,
or
go
to
be
marry
!
<EOS>
so
charming
as
you
be
!
"
    
<EOS>
Emma
laugh
,
and
reply
,
  
"
My
be
charming
,
Harriet
,
be
not
quite
enough
to
induce
me
to
marry
;
I
must
find
other
people
charm
 
one
other
person
at
least
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
not
only
,
not
go
to
be
marry
,
at
present
,
but
have
very
little
intention
of
ever
marry
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
 
<EOS>
so
you
say
;
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
believe
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
see
somebody
very
superior
to
any
one
I
have
see
yet
,
to
be
tempt
;
Mr.
Elton
,
you
know
,
(
recollect
herself
,
)
be
out
of
the
question
:
and
I
do
_
not

wish
to
see
any
such
person

<EOS>
I
would
rather
not
be
tempt
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
really
change
for
the
well
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
to
marry
,
I
must
expect
to
repent
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
it
be
so
odd
to
hear
a
woman
talk
so
!
"
    
<EOS>
"
I
have
none
of
the
usual
inducement
of
woman
to
marry
.
<EOS>
be
I
to
fall
in
love
,
indeed
,
it
would
be
a
different
thing
!
<EOS>
but
I
never
have
be
in
love
;
it
be
not
my
way
,
or
my
nature
;
and
I
do
not
think
I
ever
shall
.
<EOS>
and
,
without
love
,
I
be
sure
I
should
be
a
fool
to
change
such
a
situation
as
mine
.
<EOS>
Fortune
I
do
not
want
;
employment
I
do
not
want
;
consequence
I
do
not
want
:
I
believe
few
married
woman
be
half
as
much
mistress
of
their
husband
's
house
as
I
be
of
Hartfield
;
and
never
,
never
could
I
expect
to
be
so
truly
beloved
and
important
;
so
always
first
and
always
right
in
any
man
's
eye
as
I
be
in
my
father
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
then
,
to
be
an
old
maid
at
last
,
like
Miss
Bates
!

that
be
as
formidable
an
image
as
you
could
present
,
Harriet
;

if
I
think
I
should
ever
be
like
Miss
Bates
!
<EOS>
so
silly
 
<EOS>
so
satisfied
 
<EOS>
so
smile
 
<EOS>
so
prose
 
so
undistinguishing

unfastidious

so
apt
to
tell
every
thing
relative

I
would
marry
to

morrow

<EOS>
but
between

I
be
convince
there
never
can

in
be
unmarried
.
<EOS>

<EOS>

still
,
you
will
be
an
old
maid

that
be
so
dreadful
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
never
mind
,
Harriet
<EOS>
,
I
shall
not
be
a
poor
old
maid
;
and
it
be
poverty
only
which
make
celibacy
contemptible
to
a
generous
public
!
<EOS>
a
single
woman
,
with
a
very
narrow
income
,
must
be
a
ridiculous
,
disagreeable
old
maid
!
<EOS>
the
proper
sport
of
boy
and
girl
,
but
a
single
woman
,
of
good
fortune
,
be
always
respectable
,
and
may
be
as
sensible
and
pleasant
as
any
body
else
.
<EOS>
and
the
distinction
be
not
quite
so
much
against
the
candour
and
common
sense
of
the
world
as
appear
at
first
;
for
a
very
narrow
income
have
a
tendency
to
contract
the
mind
,
and
sour
the
temper
.
<EOS>
those
who
can
barely
live
,
and
who
live
perforce
in
a
very
small
,
and
generally
very
inferior
,
society
,
may
well
be
illiberal
and
cross
.
<EOS>
this
do
not
apply
,
however
,
to
Miss
Bates
;
she
be
only
too
good
natured
and
too
silly
to
suit
me
;
but
,
in
general
,
she
be
very
much
to
the
taste
of
every
body
,
though
single
and
though
poor
.
<EOS>
poverty
certainly
have
not
contract
her
mind
<EOS>
:
I
really
believe
,
if
she
have
only
a
shilling
in
the
world
,
she
would
be
very
likely
to
give
away
sixpence
of
it
;
and
nobody
be
afraid
of
her
:
that
be
a
great
charm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"

me

you
do

<EOS>

will
be
as
open

me

with
no

I

will
be

of
them

to
supply
every
sort
of
sensation
that
decline
life
can

there
will
be
enough
for
every
hope

none
can
equal
that
of

it
suit
my

comfort
well

My

They

approach
the

<EOS>
Emma

very
compassionate
;

the
distress
of
the
poor
be
as
sure
of
relief
from
her
personal
attention
and
kindness
,
her
counsel

her
patience

as
from
her
purse

<EOS>
She
understand
their
way

could
allow
for
their
ignorance

their
temptation
,
have
no
romantic
expectation
of
extraordinary
virtue
from
those
for
whom
education
have
do
so
little

enter
into
their
trouble
with
ready
sympathy

always
give
her
assistance

as
much
intelligence

good

will

in

it
be
sickness

she
come

after
remain
there
as
long

she
quit

cross
the
low
hedge

totter
footstep

end
the
narrow

slippery
path
through

bring

into

lane
again

"
I
do
not

stop
to
look
once
more

within

no

her
companion

on

a
slight
bend

bend
be
pass

Mr.
Elton
be
immediately
in
sight
;

so
near
as
to
give
Emma
time
only
to
say
farther
,

ah
!

Harriet

here
come
a
very
sudden

may
be
allow
that

have
produce
exertion

relief
to
the
sufferer

it
have
do
all
that

only
distress

could
just
answer
,
"
oh
!

yes

before
the
gentleman
join
them

<EOS>
the
want

suffering
of
the
poor
family
,
however

be
the
first
subject
on
meeting

He
have
be
go
to
call
on
them

His
visit
he
would
now
defer

they
have
a
very
interesting
parley
about
what
could
be
do

should
be
do

Mr.
Elton
then
turn
back
to
accompany
them

to
fall
in
with
each
other
on
such
an
errand

this

think
Emma
;

to
meet
in
a
charitable
scheme

this
will
bring
a
great
increase

love

side

should
not
wonder

to
bring
on
the
declaration

<EOS>
anxious
to
separate
herself
from
them
as
far
as
she
could
,
she
soon
afterwards
take
possession
of
a
narrow
footpath
,
a
little
raise
on
one
side
of
the
lane
,
leave
them
together
in
the
main
road

<EOS>
but
she
have
not
be
there
two
minute
when
she
find
that
Harriet
's
habit
of
dependence
and
imitation
be
bring
her
up
too
,
and
that
,
in
short
,
they
would
both
be
soon
after
her
.
<EOS>
this
would
not
do
;
she
immediately
stop
,
under
pretence
of
have
some
alteration
to
make
in
the
lacing
of
her
half
-
boot
,
and
stoop
down
in
complete
occupation
of
the
footpath
,
beg
them
to
have
the
goodness
to
walk
on
,
and
she
would
follow
in
half

from

set
out

with
her
pitcher

to

broth
from
Hartfield

to
walk
by
the
side

this
child

talk
to
and
question
her

be
the
most
natural
thing
in

She
gain
on
them

involuntarily

the
child

theirs
rather
slow

she
be
the
more
concerned
at
it
,
from

evidently
in
a
conversation
which
interest
them

<EOS>
Mr.
Elton

with

very
pleased
attention

have
send
the

on

begin
to
think
how
she
may
draw
back
a
little
more

they
both
look
around

she
be
oblige
to
join
them

<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
be
still
talk
,
still
engage
in
some
interesting
detail
;
and
Emma
experience
some
disappointment
when
she
find
that
he
be
only
give
his
fair
companion
an
account
of
the
yesterday
's
party
at
his
friend
Cole

and
that
she

for
the
Stilton
cheese
,
the

the
butter
,
the
celery
,
the

all
the

this
would

any

will
serve

introduction
to
what
be
near
the
heart
.
<EOS>
if
I
could
but
have
keep
longer
away

"
  
<EOS>
They
now
walk
on
together
quietly
,
till
within
view
of
the
vicarage
pale
,
when
a
sudden
resolution
,
of
at
least
get
Harriet
into
the
house
,
make
her
again
find
something
very
much
amiss
about
her
boot
,
and
fall
behind
to
arrange
it
once
more
.
<EOS>
She
then
break
the
lace
off
short
,
and
dexterously
throw
it
into
a
ditch
,
be
presently
oblige
to
entreat
them
to
stop
,
and
acknowledge
her
inability
to
put
herself
to
right
so
as
to
be
able
to
walk
home
in
tolerable
comfort

<EOS>
"
part

she

and
<EOS>
I
do
not

how
I
be
to
contrive
.
<EOS>
I
really
be
a
most
troublesome
companion
to
you
both
,
but
I
hope
I
be
not
often
so
ill

equip
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
,
I
must
beg
leave
to
stop
at
your
house
,
and
ask
your
housekeeper
for
a
bit
of
ribband
or
string
,
or
any
thing
just
to
keep
my
boot
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
look
all
happiness
at
this
proposition
;
and
nothing
could
exceed
his
alertness
and
attention
in
conduct
them
into
his
house
and
endeavour
to
make
every
thing
appear
to
advantage
.
<EOS>
the
room
they
be
take
into
be
the
one
he
chiefly
occupy
,
and
look
forwards
;
behind
it
be
another
with
which
it
immediately
communicate
;
the
door
between
them
be
open
,
and
Emma
pass
into
it
with
the
housekeeper
to
receive
her
assistance
in
the
most
comfortable
manner
.
<EOS>
She
be
oblige
to
leave
the
door
ajar
as
she
find
it
;
but
she
fully
intend
that
Mr.
Elton
should
close
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
closed
,
however
,
it
still
remain
ajar
;
but
by
engage
the
housekeeper
in
incessant
conversation
,
she
hope
to
make
it
practicable
for
him
to
chuse
his
own
subject
in
the
adjoining
room
.
<EOS>
for
ten
minute
she
could
hear
nothing
but
herself
.
<EOS>
It
could
be
protract
no
longer
.
<EOS>
She
be
then
oblige
to
be
finish
,
and
make
her
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
the
lover
be
stand
together
at
one
of
the
window

<EOS>
It
have
a
most
favourable
aspect
;
and
,
for
half
a
minute
,
Emma
feel
the
glory
of
have
scheme
successfully
.
<EOS>
but
it
would
not
do
;
he
have
not
come
to
the
point
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
most
agreeable
,
most
delightful
;
he
have
tell
Harriet
that
he
have
see
them
go
by
,
and
have
purposely
follow
them
;
other
little
gallantry
and
allusion
have
be
dropt
,
but
nothing
serious
.
  
<EOS>
"
cautious
,
very
cautious
,
"
think
Emma
;
"
he
advance
inch
by
inch
,
and
will
hazard
nothing
till
he
believe
himself
secure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
still
,
however
,
though
every
thing
have
not
be
accomplish
by
her
ingenious
device
,
she
could
not
but
flatter
herself
that
it
have
be
the
occasion
of
much
present
enjoyment
to
both
,
and
must
be
lead
them
forward
to
the
great
event
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
must
now
be
leave
to
himself
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
longer
in
Emma
's
power
to
superintend
his
happiness
or
quicken
his
measure
.
<EOS>
the
coming
of
her
sister
's
family
be
so
very
near
at
hand
,
that
first
in
anticipation
,
and
then
in
reality
,
it
become
henceforth
her
prime
object
of
interest
;
and
during
the
ten
day
of
their
stay
at
Hartfield
it
be
not
to
be
expect
 
<EOS>
she
do
not
herself
expect
 
that
any
thing
beyond
occasional
,
fortuitous
assistance
could
be
afford
by
her
to
the
lover
.
<EOS>
They
may
advance
rapidly
if
they
would
,
however
;
they
must
advance
somehow
or
other
whether
they
would
or
no
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
wish
to
have
more
leisure
for
them
.
<EOS>
there
be
people
,
who
the
more
you
do
for
them
,
the
less
they
will
do
for
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
John
Knightley
,
from
have
be
long
than
usual
absent
from
Surry
,
be
exciting
of
course
rather
more
than
the
usual
interest
.
<EOS>
till
this
year
,
every
long
vacation
since
their
marriage
have
be
divide
between
Hartfield
and
Donwell
Abbey
;
but
all
the
holiday
of
this
autumn
have
be
give
to
sea
-
bathing
for
the
child
,
and
it
be
therefore
many
month
since
they
have
be
see
in
a
regular
way
by
their
Surry
connexion
,
or
see
at
all
by
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
who
could
not
be
induce
to
get
so
far
as
London
,
even
for
poor
Isabella
's
sake
;
and
who
consequently
be
now
most
nervously
and
apprehensively
happy
in
forestall
this
too
short
visit
.
  
<EOS>
He
think
much
of
the
evil
of
the
journey
for
her
,
and
not
a
little
of
the
fatigue
of
his
own
horse
and
coachman
who
be
to
bring
some
of
the
party
the
last
half
of
the
way
;
but
his
alarm
be
needless
;
the
sixteen
mile
be
happily
accomplish
,
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
John
Knightley
,
their
five
child
,
and
a
competent
number
of
nursery
-
maid
,
all
reach
Hartfield
in
safety
.
<EOS>
the
bustle
and
joy
of
such
an
arrival
,
the
many
to
be
talk
to
,
welcome
,
encourage
,
and
variously
disperse
and
dispose
of
,
produce
a
noise
and
confusion
which
his
nerve
could
not
have
bear
under
any
other
cause
,
nor
have
endure
much
longer
even
for
this
;
but
the
way
of
Hartfield
and
the
feeling
of
her
father
be
so
respect
by
Mrs.
John
Knightley
,
that
in
spite
of
maternal
solicitude
for
the
immediate
enjoyment
of
her
little
one
,
and
for
their
have
instantly
all
the
liberty
and
attendance
,
all
the
eating
and
drink
,
and
sleep
and
play
,
which
they
could
possibly
wish
for
,
without
the
small
delay
,
the
child
be
never
allow
to
be
long
a
disturbance
to
him
,
either
in
themselves
or
in
any
restless
attendance
on
them
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
John
Knightley
be
a
pretty
,
elegant
little
woman
,
of
gentle
,
quiet
manner
,
and
a
disposition
remarkably
amiable
and
affectionate
;
wrapt
up
in
her
family
;
a
devoted
wife
,
a
doating
mother
,
and
so
tenderly
attach
to
her
father
and
sister
that
,
but
for
these
high
tie
,
a
warm
love
may
have
seem
impossible
.
<EOS>
She
could
never
see
a
fault
in
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
a
woman
of
strong
understanding
or
any
quickness
;
and
with
this
resemblance
of
her
father
,
she
inherit
also
much
of
his
constitution
;
be
delicate
in
her
own
health
,
over
-
careful
of
that
of
her
child
,
have
many
fear
and
many
nerve
,
and
be
as
fond
of
her
own
Mr.
Wingfield
in
town
as
her
father
could
be
of
Mr.
Perry
.
<EOS>
They
be
alike
too
,
in
a
general
benevolence
of
temper
,
and
a
strong
habit
of
regard
for
every
old
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
John
Knightley
be
a
tall
,
gentleman
-
like
,
and
very
clever
man
;
rise
in
his
profession
,
domestic
,
and
respectable
in
his
private
character
;
but
with
reserved
manner
which
prevent
his
be
generally
pleasing
;
and
capable
of
be
sometimes
out
of
humour
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
an
ill
-
tempered
man
,
not
so
often
unreasonably
cross
as
to
deserve
such
a
reproach
;
but
his
temper
be
not
his
great
perfection
;
and
,
indeed
,
with
such
a
worship
wife
,
it
be
hardly
possible
that
any
natural
defect
in
it
should
not
be
increase
.
<EOS>
the
extreme
sweetness
of
her
temper
must
hurt
his
.
<EOS>
He
have
all
the
clearness
and
quickness
of
mind
which
she
want
,
and
he
could
sometimes
act
an
ungracious
,
or
say
a
severe
thing
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
great
favourite
with
his
fair
sister
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
nothing
wrong
in
him
escape
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
quick
in
feel
the
little
injury
to
Isabella
,
which
Isabella
never
feel
herself
.
<EOS>
perhaps
she
may
have
pass
over
more
have
his
manner
be
flattering
to
Isabella
's
sister
,
but
they
be
only
those
of
a
calmly
kind
brother
and
friend
,
without
praise
and
without
blindness
;
but
hardly
any
degree
of
personal
compliment
could
have
make
her
regardless
of
that
great
fault
of
all
in
her
eye
which
he
sometimes
fall
into
,
the
want
of
respectful
forbearance
towards
her
father
.
<EOS>
there
he
have
not
always
the
patience
that
could
have
be
wish
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
peculiarity
and
fidgetiness
be
sometimes
provoke
him
to
a
rational
remonstrance
or
sharp
retort
equally
ill
-
bestow
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
often
happen
;
for
Mr.
John
Knightley
have
really
a
great
regard
for
his
father
-
in
-
law
,
and
generally
a
strong
sense
of
what
be
due
to
him
;
but
it
be
too
often
for
Emma
's
charity
,
especially
as
there
be
all
the
pain
of
apprehension
frequently
to
be
endure
,
though
the
offence
come
not
.
<EOS>
the
beginning
,
however
,
of
every
visit
display
none
but
the
proper
feeling
,
and
this
being
of
necessity
so
short
may
be
hope
to
pass
away
in
unsullied
cordiality
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
be
long
seat
and
compose
when
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
with
a
melancholy
shake
of
the
head
and
a
sigh
,
call
his
daughter
's
attention
to
the
sad
change
at
Hartfield
since
she
have
be
there
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah

poor
Miss

It
be
a
grievous
business

I
have
be
so
grieve
for

<EOS>
I
could
not
imagine
how
you
could
possibly
do
without
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
sad
change
indeed

I

she
be
pretty
well

Mr.
John
Knightley
here
ask
Emma
quietly
whether
there
be
any
doubt
of
the
air
of
randall

"

<EOS>
no

ask
Isabella
in

plaintive
tone
which
just
suit
her
father

<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
hesitate
.
 
<EOS>
"
not

often

my

as
I
could

oh

papa

we
have

one
entire

They

very
kind
in
their
visit

<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
be
really

kind

<EOS>
Papa
,
if
you
speak
in
that
melancholy
way

you
will
be
give
Isabella
a
false
idea
of
us
all

<EOS>
every
body
must
be
aware
that
Miss
Taylor
must
be
miss
,
but
every
body
ought
also
to
be
assure
that
Mr.

Mrs.
Weston
do
really
prevent
our
miss
her
by
any
mean

the
extent
we
ourselves
anticipate
 
which
be
the
exact
truth

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

just
as
it
should
be

say
Mr.

just

I
hope
it
be
from

Her

I

I
hope
you
will

<EOS>

why

say
Mr.

certainly
 
I

you

Mr.

be
rather

he
take

I
suspect

much
more

that
is
,
upon
the
power
of
eating

up

she

let
it
pass

<EOS>
She
would
keep
the
peace

possible

and
there
be
something
honourable
and
valuable
in
the
strong
domestic
habit
,
the
all

sufficiency
of
home
to
himself
,
whence
result
her
brother

disposition
to
look
down
on
the
common
rate
of
social
intercourse

those
to
whom
it

<EOS>
Mr.

with

in

the
consideration

what
be
due

she
have
particular
pleasure

from

it

Mr.
Perry
 
<EOS>
how
be
he
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
pretty
well
;
<EOS>
but
not
quite
well
.
<EOS>
poor
Perry
be
bilious
,
and
he
have
not
time
to
take
care
of
himself
 
<EOS>
he
tell
me
he
have
not
time
to
take
care
of
himself
 
which
be
very
sad
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
always
want
all
round
the
country
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
there
be
not
a
man
in
such
practice
anywhere
.
<EOS>
but
then
there
be
not
so
clever
a
man
any
where
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
Mrs.
Perry
and
the
child
<EOS>
,
how
be
they
?
<EOS>
do
the
child
grow
?
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
regard
for
Mr.
Perry
.
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
be
call
soon
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
so
pleased
to
see
my
little
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
will
be
here
to
-
morrow
,
for
I
have
a
question
or
two
to
ask
him
about
myself
of
some
consequence
.
<EOS>
and
,
my
dear
,
whenever
he
come
,
you
have
better
let
him
look
at
little
Bella
's
throat
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
my
dear
sir
,
her
throat
be
so
much
well
that
I
have
hardly
any
uneasiness
about
it
.
<EOS>
either
bathing
have
be
of
the
great
service
to
her
,
or
else
it
be
to
be
attribute
to
an
excellent
embrocation
of
Mr.
Wingfield
's
,
which
we
have
be
apply
at
time
ever
since
August
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
very
likely
,
my
dear
,
that
bathing
should
have
be
of
use
to
her
 
<EOS>
and
if
I
have
know
you
be
want
an
embrocation
<EOS>
,
I
would
have
speak
to
    
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
me
to
have
forget
Mrs.
and
Miss
Bates
,
"
say
Emma
,
"
I
have
not
hear
one
inquiry
after
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
oh
!
<EOS>
the
good
Bateses
 
<EOS>
I
be
quite
ashamed
of
myself
 
<EOS>
but
you
mention
them
in
most
of
your
letter
.
<EOS>
I
hope
they
be
quite
well
.
<EOS>
good
old
Mrs.
Bates
 
<EOS>
I
will
call
upon
her
to
-
morrow
,
and
take
my
child
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
always
so
pleased
to
see
my
child
.
 
<EOS>
and
that
excellent
Miss
Bates
!
 
<EOS>
such
thorough
worthy
people
!
 
<EOS>
how
be
they
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
pretty
well
,
my
dear
,
upon
the
whole
.
<EOS>
but
poor
Mrs.
Bates
have
a
bad
cold
about
a
month
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
sorry
I
be
!
<EOS>
but
cold
be
never
so
prevalent
as
they
have
be
this
autumn
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wingfield
tell
me
that
he
have
never
know
them
more
general
or
heavy
 
except
when
it
have
be
quite
an
influenza
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
have
be
a
good
deal
the
case
,
my
dear
;
but
not
to
the
degree
you
mention
.
<EOS>
Perry
say
that
cold
have
be
very
general
,
but
not
so
heavy
as
he
have
very
often
know
them
in
November
.
<EOS>
perry
do
not
call
it
altogether
a
sickly
season
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
do
not
know
that
Mr.
Wingfield
consider
<EOS>
it
_
very
_
<EOS>
sickly
except
    
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
my
poor
dear
child
,
the
truth
be
,
that
in
London
it
be
always
a
sickly
season
.
<EOS>
nobody
be
healthy
in
London
,
nobody
can
be
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
dreadful
thing
to
have
you
force
to
live
there
!
<EOS>
so
far
off
!
 
<EOS>
and
the
air
so
bad
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
 
_
we
_
be
not
at
all
in
a
bad
air
.
<EOS>
Our
part
of
London
be
very
superior
to
most
other
!
 
<EOS>
You
must
not
confound
us
with
London
in
general
,
my
dear
sir
.
<EOS>
the
neighbourhood
of
Brunswick
Square
be
very
different
from
almost
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
We
be
so
very
airy
!
<EOS>
I
should
be
unwilling
,
I
own
,
to
live
in
any
other
part
of
the
town
;
 
there
be
hardly
any
other
that
I
could
be
satisfied
to
have
my
child
in
:
but
_
we
_
be
so
remarkably
airy
!
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Wingfield
think
the
vicinity
of
Brunswick
Square
decidedly
the
most
favourable
as
to
air
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
it
be
not
like
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
You
make
the
good
of
it
 
<EOS>
but
after
you
have
be
a
week
at
Hartfield
,
you
be
all
of
you
different
creature
;
you
do
not
look
like
the
same
.
<EOS>
now
I
can
not
say
,
that
I
think
you
be
any
of
you
look
well
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
to
hear
you
say
so
,
sir
;
but
I
assure
you
,
except
those
little
nervous
head
-
ache
and
palpitation
which
I
be
never
entirely
free
from
anywhere
<EOS>
,
I
be
quite
well
myself
;
and
if
the
child
be
rather
pale
before
they
go
to
bed
,
it
be
only
because
they
be
a
little
more
tired
than
usual
,
from
their
journey
and
the
happiness
of
come
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
think
better
of
their
look
to
-
morrow
;
for
I
assure
you
Mr.
Wingfield
tell
me
,
that
he
do
not
believe
he
have
ever
send
us
off
altogether
,
in
such
good
case
.
<EOS>
I
trust
,
at
least
,
that
you
do
not
think
Mr.
Knightley
look
ill
,
"
turn
her
eye
with
affectionate
anxiety
towards
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
middling
,
my
dear
;
I
can
not
compliment
you
.
<EOS>
I
think
Mr.
John
Knightley
very
far
from
look
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
do
you
speak
to
me
?
"
cry
Mr.
John
Knightley
,
hear
his
own
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
to
find
,
my
love
,
that
my
father
do
not
think
you
look
well
 
<EOS>
but
I
hope
it
be
only
from
be
a
little
fatigued
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
wish
,
however
,
as
you
know
,
that
you
have
see
Mr.
Wingfield
before
you
leave
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
isabella
,
"
 
exclaim
he
hastily
 
"
pray
do
not
concern
yourself
about
my
look
.
<EOS>
be
satisfied
with
doctoring
and
coddle
yourself
and
the
child
,
and
let
me
look
as
I
chuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
thoroughly
understand
what
you
be
tell
your
brother
,
"
cry
Emma
,
"
about
your
friend
Mr.
Graham
's
intending
to
have
a
bailiff
from
Scotland
,
to
look
after
his
new
estate
.
<EOS>
what
will
it
answer
?
<EOS>
Will
not
the
old
prejudice
be
too
strong
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
she
talk
in
this
way
so
long
and
successfully
that
,
when
force
to
give
her
attention
again
to
her
father
and
sister
,
she
have
nothing
bad
to
hear
than
Isabella
's
kind
inquiry
after
Jane
Fairfax
;
and
<EOS>
Jane
Fairfax
,
though
no
great
favourite
with
her
in
general
,
she
be
at
that
moment
very
happy
to
assist
in
praise
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
sweet
,
amiable
Jane
Fairfax
!
"
say
Mrs.
John
Knightley
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
so
long
since
I
have
see
her
,
except
now
and
then
for
a
moment
accidentally
in
town
!
<EOS>
what
happiness
it
must
be
to
her
good
old
grandmother
and
excellent
aunt
,
when
she
come
to
visit
them
!
<EOS>
I
always
regret
excessively
on
dear
Emma
's
account
that
she
can
not
be
more
at
Highbury
;
but
now
their
daughter
be
married
,
I
suppose
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
will
not
be
able
to
part
with
her
at
all
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
such
a
delightful
companion
for
Emma
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
agree
to
it
all
,
but
add
,
  
"
Our
little
friend
Harriet
Smith
,
however
,
be
just
such
another
pretty
kind
of
young
person
.
<EOS>
You
will
like
Harriet
.
<EOS>
Emma
could
not
have
a
well
companion
than
Harriet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
most
happy
to
hear
it
 
but
<EOS>
only
Jane
Fairfax
one
know
to
be
so
very
accomplished
and
superior
!
 
<EOS>
and
exactly
Emma
's
age
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
topic
be
discuss
very
happily
,
and
other
succeed
of
similar
moment
,
and
pass
away
with
similar
harmony
;
but
the
evening
do
not
close
without
a
little
return
of
agitation
.
<EOS>
the
gruel
come
and
supply
a
great
deal
to
be
say
 
much
praise
and
many
comment
 
<EOS>
undoubte
decision
of
its
wholesomeness
for
every
constitution
,
and
pretty
severe
Philippics
upon
the
many
house
where
it
be
never
meet
with
tolerable
;
 
but
,
unfortunately
,
among
the
failure
which
the
daughter
have
to
instance
,
the
most
recent
,
and
therefore
most
prominent
,
be
in
her
own
cook
at
South
End
,
a
young
woman
hire
for
the
time
,
who
never
have
be
able
to
understand
what
she
mean
by
a
basin
of
nice
smooth
gruel
,
thin
,
but
not
too
thin
.
<EOS>
often
as
she
have
wish
for
and
order
it
,
she
have
never
be
able
to
get
any
thing
tolerable
.
<EOS>
here
be
a
dangerous
opening
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
say
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
shake
his
head
and
fix
his
eye
on
her
with
tender
concern
.
 
<EOS>
the
ejaculation
in
Emma
's
ear
express
,
"
ah
!
<EOS>
there
be
no
end
of
the
sad
consequence
of
your
go
to
South
End
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
bear
talk
of
.
"
<EOS>
and
for
a
little
while
she
hope
he
would
not
talk
of
it
,
and
that
a
silent
rumination
may
suffice
to
restore
him
to
the
relish
of
his
own
smooth
gruel
.
<EOS>
after
an
interval
of
some
minute
,
however
,
he
begin
with
,
  
"
I
shall
always
be
very
sorry
that
you
go
to
the
sea
this
autumn
,
instead
of
come
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
why
should
you
be
sorry
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
it
do
the
child
a
great
deal
of
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
,
moreover
,
if
you
must
go
to
the
sea
,
it
have
well
not
have
be
to
South
End
.
<EOS>
south
end
be
an
unhealthy
place
.
<EOS>
Perry
be
surprize
to
hear
you
have
fix
upon
South
End
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
there
be
such
an
idea
with
many
people
,
but
indeed
it
be
quite
a
mistake
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
have
our
health
perfectly
well
there
,
never
find
the
least
inconvenience
from
the
mud
;
and
Mr.
Wingfield
say
it
be
entirely
a
mistake
to
suppose
the
place
unhealthy
;
and
I
be
sure
he
may
be
depend
on
,
for
he
thoroughly
understand
the
nature
of
the
air
,
and
his
own
brother
and
family
have
be
there
repeatedly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
go
to
Cromer
,
my
dear
,
if
you
go
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
Perry
be
a
week
at
Cromer
once
,
and
he
hold
it
to
be
the
good
of
all
the
sea
-
bathing
place
.
<EOS>
a
fine
open
sea
,
he
say
,
and
very
pure
air
.
<EOS>
and
,
by
what
I
understand
,
you
may
have
have
lodging
there
quite
away
from
the
sea
 
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
 
very
comfortable
.
<EOS>
You
should
have
consult
Perry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
my
dear
sir
,
the
difference
of
the
journey
;
 
only
consider
how
great
it
would
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
an
hundred
mile
,
perhaps
,
instead
of
forty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
as
Perry
say
,
where
health
be
at
stake
,
nothing
else
should
be
consider
;
and
if
one
be
to
travel
,
there
be
not
much
to
chuse
between
forty
mile
and
an
hundred
.
 
<EOS>
better
not
move
at
all
,
better
stay
in
London
altogether
than
travel
forty
mile
to
get
into
a
bad
air
.
<EOS>
this
be
just
what
Perry
say
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
him
a
very
ill
-
judge
measure
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
's
attempt
to
stop
her
father
have
be
vain
;
and
when
he
have
reach
such
a
point
as
this
,
she
could
not
wonder
at
her
brother
-
in
-
law
's
break
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Perry
,
"
say
he
,
in
a
voice
of
very
strong
displeasure
,
"
would
do
as
well
to
keep
his
opinion
till
it
be
ask
for
.
<EOS>
why
do
he
make
it
any
business
of
his
,
to
wonder
at
what
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
at
my
take
my
family
to
one
part
of
the
coast
or
another
?
 
<EOS>
I
may
be
allow
,
I
hope
,
the
use
of
my
judgment
as
well
as
Mr.
Perry
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
his
direction
no
more
than
his
drug
.
"
<EOS>
He
pause
 
and
grow
cooler
in
a
moment
,
add
,
with
only
sarcastic
dryness
,
"
if
Mr.
Perry
can
tell
me
how
to
convey
a
wife
and
five
child
a
distance
of
an
hundred
and
thirty
mile
with
no
great
expense
or
inconvenience
than
a
distance
of
forty
,
I
should
be
as
willing
to
prefer
Cromer
to
South
End
as
he
could
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
true
,
true
,
"

Mr.
Knightley
,
with
most
ready
interposition

very
true

that
be
a
consideration
indeed

<EOS>
but
John
,
as
to
what
I
be
tell
you
of
my
idea
of
move
the
path
to
Langham
,
of
turn
it
more
to
the
right
that
it
may
not
cut
through
the
home
meadow
,
I
can
not
conceive
any
difficulty
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
attempt
it
,
if
it
be
to
be
the
mean
of
inconvenience
to
the
Highbury
people
,
but
if
you
call
to
mind
exactly
the
present
line
of
the
path
....
<EOS>
the
only
way
of
prove
it
,
however
,
will
be
to
turn
to
our
map
.
<EOS>
I
shall
see
you
at
the
Abbey
to
-
morrow
morning
<EOS>
I
hope
,
and
then
we
will
look
them
over
,
and
you
shall
give
me
your
opinion
.

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
be
rather
agitate
by
such
harsh
reflection
on
his
friend
Perry
,
<EOS>
to
whom
he
have

there
could
hardly

creature
in

Mrs.

in
this
short
visit
to
Hartfield
,
go
about
every
morning
among
her
old
acquaintance
with
her

and
talk
over
what
she
have
do
every
evening
with
her
father

<EOS>
She
have
nothing
to
wish
otherwise

not

so
swiftly

<EOS>
It

a
delightful
visit

perfect
,
in

too
short
.
  
<EOS>
in

their
evening

less
engaged
with

one
complete
dinner
engagement
,
and
out
of
the
house
too
,
there
be
no
avoiding
,
though
at
Christmas

<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
would
take
no
denial
;
they
must
all
dine
at

one
day
;
 
<EOS>
even
Mr.
Woodhouse
be
persuade
to
think
it
a
possible
thing
in
preference
to
a
division
of
the
party
.
  
<EOS>
how
they
be
all
to
be
convey
,
he
would
have
make
a
difficulty
if
he
could
,
but
as
his
son
and
daughter
's
carriage
and
horse
be
actually
at
Hartfield
,
he
be
not
able
to
make
more
than
a
simple
question
on
that
head
;
it
hardly
amount
to
a
doubt
;
nor
do
it
occupy
Emma
long
to
convince
him
that
they
may
in
one
of
the
carriage
find
room
for
Harriet
also

Harriet

the

She

Mrs.
Goddard
be
full
of
care
and
affection
,
Mr.
Perry
be

and
Harriet
herself
be
too
ill
and
low
to
resist
the
authority
which
exclude
her
from
this
delightful
engagement
,
though
she
could
not
speak
of
her
loss
without

Emma
sit
with

Mrs.

's
unavoidable
absence

and
raise
her
spirit
by

how
much
Mr.

tolerably
comfortable

in

sweet
dependence
of

a
most
comfortless
visit

much

<EOS>
She
have
not

many
yard
from
Mrs.

door

when
she
be
meet
by
Mr.

come
towards

as
they

slowly
together
in
conversation
about
the
invalid
 
of

he

on
the
rumour
of
considerable
illness

with
a
great
deal
of
heat
about

a
quick
,
low

she
be
sorry
to
find
from

that
Harriet

liable

very
bad
sore

throat

have
often
alarm

Mr.

look
all
alarm

he
exclaim

"
a

I

have
perry
see

<EOS>
indeed
you
should
take
care
of
yourself
as
well
as
of
your
friend

<EOS>
let
me
entreat
you
to
run
no
risk
.
<EOS>
why
do
not
Perry
see
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
,
who
be
not
really
at
all
frighten
herself
,
tranquillise
this
excess
of
apprehension
by
assurance
of
Mrs.
Goddard
's
experience
and
care
;
but
as
there
must
still
remain
a
degree
of
uneasiness
which
she
could
not
wish
to
reason
away
,
which
she
would
rather
feed
and
assist
than
not
,
she
add
soon
afterwards
 
as
if
quite
another
subject
,
  
"
It
be
so
cold
,
so
very
cold
 
and
look
and
feel
so
very
much
like
snow
,
that
if
it
be
to
any
other
place
or
with
any
other
party
,
I
should
really
try
not
to
go
out
to
-
day
 
and
dissuade
my
father
from
venture
;
but
as
he
have
make
up
his
mind
,
and
do
not
seem
to
feel
the
cold
himself
,
I
do
not
like
to
interfere
,
as
I
know
it
would
be
so
great
a
disappointment
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
but
,
upon
my
word
,
Mr.
Elton
,
in
your
case
,
I
should
certainly
excuse
myself
.
<EOS>
You
appear
to
me
a
little
hoarse
already
,
and
when
you
consider
what
demand
of
voice
and
what
fatigue
to
-
morrow
will
bring
,
I
think
it
would
be
no
more
than
common
prudence
to
stay
at
home
and
take
care
of
yourself
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
look
as
if
he
do
not
very
well
know
what
answer
to
make
;
which
be
exactly
the
case
;
for
though
very
much
gratify
by
the
kind
care
of
such
a
fair
lady
,
and
not
like
to
resist
any
advice
of
her
's
,
he
have
not
really
the
least
inclination
to
give
up
the
visit
;
 
but
Emma
,
too
eager
and
busy
in
her
own
previous
conception
and
view
to
hear
him
impartially
,
or
see
him
with
clear
vision
,
be
very
well
satisfied
with
his
muttering
acknowledgment
of
its
be
"
very
cold
,
certainly
very
cold
,
"
and
walk
on
,
rejoice
in
have
extricate
him
from
randall
,
and
secure
him
the
power
of
send
to
inquire
after
Harriet
every
hour
of
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
quite
right
,
"
say
she
;
 
"
we
will
make
your
apology
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
hardly
have
she
so
spoken
,
when
she
find
her
brother
be
civilly
offer
a
seat
in
his
carriage
,
if
the
weather
be
Mr.
Elton
's
only
objection
,
and
Mr.
Elton
actually
accept
the
offer
with
much
prompt
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
do
thing
;
Mr.
Elton
be
to
go
,
and
never
have
his
broad
handsome
face
express
more
pleasure
than
at
this
moment
;
never
have
his
smile
be
strong
,
nor
his
eye
more
exulting
than
when
he
next
look
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
she
to
herself
,
"
this
be
most
strange
!
 
<EOS>
after
I
have
get
him
off
so
well
,
to
chuse
to
go
into
company
,
and
leave
Harriet
ill
behind
!
 
<EOS>
most
strange
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
,
I
believe
,
in
many
man
,
especially
single
man
,
<EOS>
such
an
inclination
 
<EOS>
such
a
passion
for
dine
out
 
a
dinner
engagement
be
so
high
in
the
class
of
their
pleasure
,
their
employment
,
their
dignity
,
almost
their
duty
,
that
any
thing
give
way
to
it
 
<EOS>
and
this
must
be
the
case
with
Mr.
Elton
;
<EOS>
a
most
valuable
,
amiable
,
pleasing
young
man
undoubtedly
,
and
very
much
in
love
with
Harriet
;
but
still
,
he
can
not
refuse
an
invitation
,
he
must
dine
out
wherever
he
be
ask
.
<EOS>
what
a
strange
thing
love
be
!
<EOS>
he
can
see
ready
wit
in
Harriet
,
but
will
not
dine
alone
for
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
soon
afterwards
Mr.
Elton
quit
them
,
and
she
could
not
but
do
him
the
justice
of
feeling
that
there
be
a
great
deal
of
sentiment
in
his
manner
of
name
Harriet
at
part
;
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
while
assure
her
that
he
should
call
at
Mrs.
Goddard
's
for
news
of
her
fair
friend
,
the
last
thing
before
he
prepare
for
the
happiness
of
meet
her
again
,
when
he
hope
to
be
able
to
give
a
well
report
;
and
he
sigh
and
smile
himself
off
in
a
way
that
leave
the
balance
of
approbation
much
in
his
favour
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
few
minute
of
entire
silence
between
them
,
John
Knightley
begin
with
    
"
I
never
in
my
life
see
a
man
more
intent
on
be
agreeable
than
Mr.
Elton

<EOS>
It
be
downright
labour
to
him
where
lady
be
concern

<EOS>
with
man
he
can
be
rational

unaffected
,
but
when
he
have
lady

every

work

<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Elton
's
manner
be
not
perfect

reply
Emma
;
"
but
where
there
be
a
wish
to
please
,
one
ought
to
overlook
,
and
one
do
overlook
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
where
a
man
do
his
good
with
only
moderate
power
,
he
will
have
the
advantage
over
negligent
superiority

<EOS>
there
be
such
perfect
good

good

in
Mr.

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

Mr.

presently
,
with
some
slyness
,

he
seem
to
have
a
great

good

<EOS>
"
Me

<EOS>
she
reply
with
a
smile
of
astonishment
,
"

object

<EOS>
"
such
an
imagination

cross
me

I

"
Mr.

<EOS>

I
do
not

it
be
so

but
you
will
do
well
to
consider
whether
it
be
so

not

to
regulate
your
behaviour
accordingly

<EOS>
I
think
your
manner

encouraging

I
speak
as
a

well

<EOS>

I
thank
you
;

I
assure
you
you
be
quite
mistaken

<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
and
I
be
very
good
friend
,
and
nothing
more

"
and
she
walk
on
,
amuse
herself
in
the
consideration
of
the
blunder
which
often
arise
from
a
partial
knowledge
of
circumstance
,
of
the
mistake
which
people
of
high
pretension
to
judgment
be
for
ever
fall
into
;
and
not
very
well
pleased
with
her
brother
for
imagine
her
blind
and
ignorant
,
and
in
want
of
counsel
.
<EOS>
He
say
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
have
so
completely
make
up
his
mind
to
the
visit
,
that
in
spite
of
the
increase
coldness
,
he
seem
to
have
no
idea
of
shrink
from
it
,
and
set
forward
at
last
most
punctually
with
his
eld
daughter
in
his
own
carriage
,
with
less
apparent
consciousness
of
the
weather
than
either
of
the
other
;
too
full
of
the
wonder
of
his
own
going
,
and
the
pleasure
it
be
to
afford
at
randall
to
see
that
it
be
cold
,
and
too
well
wrapt
up
to
feel
it
.
<EOS>
the
cold
,
however
,
be
severe
;
and
by
the
time
the
second
carriage
be
in
motion
,
a
few
flake
of
snow
be
find
their
way
down
,
and
the
sky
have
the
appearance
of
be
so
overcharged
as
to
want
only
a
milder
air
to
produce
a
very
white
world
in
a
very
short
time
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
soon
see
that
her
companion
be
not
in
the
happy
humour

<EOS>
the
prepare
and
the
go
abroad
in
such
weather
,
with
the
sacrifice
of
his
child
after
dinner
,
be
evil
,
be
disagreeable
at
least
,
which
Mr.
John
Knightley
do
not
by
any
mean
like
;
he
anticipate
nothing
in
the
visit
that
could
be
at
all
worth
the
purchase
;
and
the
whole
of
their
drive
to
the
vicarage
be
spend
by
him
in
express
his
discontent
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
man
,
"
say
he
,
"
must
have
a
very
good
opinion
of
himself
when
he
ask
people
to
leave
their
own
fireside
,
and
encounter
such
a
day
as
this
,
for
the
sake
of
come
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
He
must
think
himself
a
most
agreeable
fellow
;
I
could
not
do
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
great
absurdity
 
actually
snow
at
this
moment
!
 
<EOS>
the
folly
of
not
allow
people
to
be
comfortable
at
home
 
and
the
folly
of
people
's
not
stay
comfortably
at
home
when
they
can
!
<EOS>
if
we
be
oblige
to
go
out
such
an
evening
as
this
,
by
any
call
of
duty
or
business
,
what
a
hardship
we
should
deem
it
;
 
and
here
be
we
,
probably
with
rather
thin
clothing
than
usual

set
forward
voluntarily

without

in
defiance
of

give
to
his
view

his
feeling

to
stay
at
home
himself

keep
all
under
shelter
that
he
can

here
be

spend
five
dull
hour
in
another
man

nothing

not

hear
again
to

<EOS>
go
in
dismal
weather

to
return
probably
in
bad
;
 
four

out
for
nothing

Emma
do
not

herself
equal

pleased
assent

no

to
emulate

true

she
have
resolution
enough
to
refrain
from
make
any
answer
at
all

<EOS>
She
could
not
be
comply
,
she
dread
be
quarrelsome
;
her
heroism
reach
only
to
silence
.
<EOS>
She
allow
him
to
talk
,
and
arrange
the
glass
,
and
wrap
herself
up
,
without
open
her
lip

<EOS>
They
arrive
,
the
carriage
turn
,
the
step
be
let
down

and
Mr.
Elton
,
spruce
,
black
,
and
smile
,
be
with
them
instantly
.
<EOS>
Emma
think
with
pleasure
of
some
change
of
subject
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
be
all
obligation
and
cheerfulness
;
he
be
so
very
cheerful
in
his
civility
indeed
,
that
she
begin
to
think
he
must
have
receive
a
different
account
of
Harriet
from
what
have
reach
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
send
while
dressing
,
and
the
answer
have
be
,
"
<EOS>
much
the

not
well

His

immediately

the
voice
of
sentiment

he
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
no
 
<EOS>
I
be
grieve
to

I

on
the
point

tell
you
that

I
do
the

last
thing
before

tell
that
Miss
Smith

not
well

by
no

well

rather
bad

<EOS>
very
much
grieve
and
concerned

I
have
flatter
myself
that
she
must
be
well
after
such
a
cordial
as
I
know
have
be
give
her
in
the
morning
.

<EOS>
Emma
smile
and
answer
 
"
My
visit
be
of
use
to
the
nervous
part
of
her
complaint
,
I
hope
;
but
not
even
I
can
charm
away
a
sore
throat
;
it
be
a
most
severe
cold
indeed
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Perry

be
with
her

as
you

hear

<EOS>
"
yes

He

her
in
these
complaint

I
hope
to
-
morrow
morning
will
bring
us
both
a
more
comfortable
report

it
be
impossible
not
to
feel
uneasiness

such
a
sad
loss
to
our
party

day

dreadful

exactly
so

indeed

<EOS>
She
will
be
miss
every
moment

<EOS>
this
be
very
proper
;
the
sigh
which
accompany
it
be
really
estimable
;
but
it
should
have
last
longer
.
<EOS>
Emma
be
rather
in
dismay
when
only
half
a
minute
afterwards
he
begin
to
speak
of
other
thing
,
and
in
a
voice
of
the
great
alacrity
and
enjoyment
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
an
excellent
device

he

the
use
of
a
sheepskin

how
very
comfortable
they
make
it

such
precaution

the

perfectly
complete

absolutely
of

It

a
very
cold
afternoon

in

nothing

snow
a

I
see

<EOS>
"
yes

John

I

we
shall
have
a
good

"
Christmas
weather
,
"
observe
Mr.
Elton
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
quite
seasonable
;
and
extremely
fortunate
we
may
think
ourselves
that
it
do
not
begin
yesterday
,
and
prevent
this
day
's
party
,
which
it
may
very
possibly
have
do
,
for
Mr.
Woodhouse
would
hardly
have
venture
<EOS>
have
there
be
much
snow
on
the
ground
;
but
now
it
be
of
no
consequence

<EOS>
this
be
quite
the
season
indeed
for
friendly
meeting
.
<EOS>
at
Christmas
every
body
invite
their
friend
about
them
,
and
people
think
little
of
even
the
bad
weather

<EOS>
I
be
snow
up
at
a
friend
's
house
once
for
a
week

<EOS>
nothing
could
be
pleasanter

<EOS>
I
go
for
only
one
night

could
not

away

very
day
se'nnight

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
John
Knightley
look
as
if
he
do
not
comprehend
the
pleasure
,
but
say
only
,
coolly
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
wish
to
be
snow
up
a
week
at
randall
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
another
time
Emma
may
have
be
amuse
,
but
she
be
too
much
astonished
now
at
Mr.
Elton
's
spirit
for
other
feeling
.
<EOS>
Harriet
seem
quite
forget
in
the
expectation
of
a
pleasant
party
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
sure
of
excellent
fire
,

he
,
"
and
every
thing
in
the
great
comfort
.
<EOS>
charming
people
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
;
 
Mrs.
Weston
indeed
be
much
beyond
praise
,
and
he
be
exactly
what
one
value
,
so
hospitable
,
and
so
fond
of
society
;
 
it
will
be
a
small
party
,
but
where
small
party
be
select
,
they
be
perhaps
the
most
agreeable
of
any
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
's
dining
-
room
do
not
accommodate
more
than
ten
comfortably
;
and
for
my
part
,
I
would
rather
,
under
such
circumstance
,
fall
short
by
two
than
exceed
by
two
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
will
agree
with
me
,
(
turn
with
a
soft
air
to
Emma
,
)
<EOS>
I
think
I
shall
certainly
have
your
approbation
,
though
Mr.
Knightley
perhaps
,
from
be
use
to
the
large
party
of
London
,
may
not
quite
enter
into
our
feeling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing

the
large
party

London

I

<EOS>
indeed

I
have
no

<EOS>
well

the

must
come

through
the

will
be
to
find
myself
safe
at
Hartfield
again

"
    
<EOS>
some
change
of
countenance
be
necessary
for
each
gentleman
as
they
walk
into
Mrs.
Weston
's
drawing
-
room
;
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
must
compose
his
joyous
look
,
and
Mr.
John
Knightley
disperse
his
ill
-
humour
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
must
smile
less
,
and
Mr.
John
Knightley
more
,
to
fit
them
for
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
only
may
be
as
nature
prompt
,
and
shew
herself
just
as
happy
as
she
be
.
<EOS>
to
her
it
be
real
enjoyment
to
be
with
the
Westons
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
be
a
great
favourite
,
and
there
be
not
a
creature
in
the
world
to
whom
she
speak
with
such
unreserve
,
as
to
his
wife
;
not
any
one
,
to
whom
she
relate
with
such
conviction
of
be
listen
to
and
understand
,
of
be
always
interesting
and
always
intelligible
,
the
little
affair
,
arrangement
,
perplexity
,
and
pleasure
of
her
father
and
herself
.
<EOS>
She
could
tell
nothing
of
Hartfield
,
in
which
Mrs.
Weston
have
not
a
lively
concern
;
and
half
an
hour
's
uninterrupted
communication
of
all
those
little
matter
on
which
the
daily
happiness
of
private
life
depend
,
be
one
of
the
first
gratification
of
each
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
pleasure
which
perhaps
the
whole
day
's
visit
may
not
afford
,
which
certainly
do
not
belong
to
the
present
half
-
hour
;
but
the
very
sight
of
Mrs.
Weston
,
her
smile
,
her
touch
,
her
voice
be
grateful
to
Emma
,
and
she
determine
to
think
as
little
as
possible
of
Mr.
Elton
's
oddity
,
or
of
any
thing
else
unpleasant
,
and
enjoy
all
that
be
enjoyable
to
the
utmost
.
  
<EOS>
the
misfortune
of
Harriet
's
cold
have
be
pretty
well
go
through
before
her
arrival
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
have
be
safely
seat
long
enough
to
give
the
history
of
it
,
besides
all
the
history
of
his
own
and
Isabella
's
come
,
and
of
Emma
's
be
to
follow
,
and
have
indeed
just
get
to
the
end
of
his
satisfaction
that
James
should
come
and
see
his
daughter
,
when
the
other
appear
,
and
Mrs.
Weston
,
who
have
be
almost
wholly
engross
by
her
attention
to
him
,
be
able
to
turn
away
and
welcome
her
dear
Emma
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
's
project
of
forget
Mr.
Elton
for
a
while
make
her
rather
sorry
to
find
,
when
they
have
all
take
their
place
,
that
he
be
close
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
difficulty
be
great
of
drive
his
strange
insensibility
towards
Harriet
,
from
her
mind
,
while
he
not
only
sit
at
her
elbow
,
but
be
continually
obtrude
his
happy
countenance
on
her
notice
,
and
solicitously
address
her
upon
every
occasion
.
<EOS>
instead
of
forget
him
,
his
behaviour
be
such
that
she
could
not
avoid
the
internal
suggestion
of
"
Can
it
really
be
as
my
brother
imagine
?
<EOS>
can
it
be
possible
for
this
man
to
be
begin
to
transfer
his
affection
from
Harriet
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
absurd
and
insufferable
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
yet
he
would
be
so
anxious
for
her
be
perfectly
warm
,
would
be
so
interested
about
her
father
,
and
so
delighted
with
Mrs.
Weston
;
and
at
last
would
begin
admire
her
drawing
with
so
much
zeal
and
so
little
knowledge
as
seem
terribly
like
a
would
-
be
lover
,
and
make
it
some
effort
with
her
to
preserve
her
good
manner
.
<EOS>
for
her
own
sake
she
could
not
be
rude
;
and
for
Harriet
's
,
in
the
hope
that
all
would
yet
turn
out
right
,
she
be
even
positively
civil
;
but
it
be
an
effort
;
especially
as
something
be
go
on
amongst
the
other
,
in
the
most
overpowering
period
of
Mr.
Elton
's
nonsense
,
which
she
particularly
wish
to
listen
to
.
<EOS>
She
hear
enough
to
know
that
Mr.
Weston
be
give
some
information
about
his
son
;
she
hear
the
word
"
my
son
,
"
and
"
Frank
,
"
and
"
my
son
,
"
repeat
several
time
over
;
and
,
from
a
few
other
half
-
syllable
very
much
suspect
that
he
be
announce
an
early
visit
from
his
son
;
but
before
she
could
quiet
Mr.
Elton
,
the
subject
be
so
completely
past
that
any
reviving
question
from
her
would
have
be
awkward
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
it
so
happen
that
in
spite
of
Emma
's
resolution
of
never
marry
,
there
be
something
in
the
name
,
in
the
idea
of
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
,
which
always
interest
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
frequently
think
 
especially
since
his
father
's
marriage
with
Miss
Taylor
 
<EOS>
that
if
she
_
be
_
to
marry
,
he
be
the
very
person
to
suit
her
in
age
,
character
and
condition
.
<EOS>
He
seem
by
this
connexion
between
the
family
,
quite
to
belong
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
but
suppose
it
to
be
a
match
that
every
body
who
know
them
must
think
of
.
<EOS>
that
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
do
think
of
it
,
she
be
very
strongly
persuade
;
and
though
not
mean
to
be
induce
by
him
,
or
by
any
body
else
,
to
give
up
a
situation
which
she
believe
more
replete
with
good
than
any
she
could
change
it
for
,
she
have
a
great
curiosity
to
see
him
,
a
decide
intention
of
find
him
pleasant
,
of
be
like
by
him
to
a
certain
degree
,
and
a
sort
of
pleasure
in
the
idea
of
their
be
couple
in
their
friend
'
imagination
.
  
<EOS>
with
such
sensation
,
Mr.
Elton
's
civility
be
dreadfully
ill
-
time
;
but
she
have
the
comfort
of
appear
very
polite
,
while
feel
very
cross
 
and
of
thinking
that
the
rest
of
the
visit
could
not
possibly
pass
without
bring
forward
the
same
information
again
,
or
the
substance
of
it
,
from
the
open
-
hearted
Mr.
Weston
.
 
<EOS>
so
it
prove
;
 
<EOS>
for
when
happily
release
from
Mr.
Elton
,
and
seat
by
Mr.
Weston
,
at
dinner
,
he
make
use
of
the
very
first
interval
in
the
care
of
hospitality
,
the
very
first
leisure
from
the
saddle
of
mutton
,
to
say
to
her
,
  
<EOS>
"
We
want
only
two
more
to
be
just
the
right
number
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
see
two
more
here
,
 
your
pretty
little
friend
,
Miss
Smith
,
and
my
son
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
should
say
we
be
quite
complete
.
<EOS>
I
believe
you
do
not
hear
me
tell
the
other
in
the
drawing
-
room
that
we
be
expect
Frank
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
letter
from
him
this
morning
,
and
he
will
be
with
us
within
a
fortnight
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
speak
with
a
very
proper
degree
of
pleasure
;
and
fully
assented
to
his
proposition
of
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
and
Miss
Smith
make
their
party
quite
complete
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
be
want
to
come
to
us
,
"
continue
Mr.
Weston
,
"
ever
since
September
:
every
letter
have
be
full
of
it
;
but
he
can
not
command
his
own
time
.
<EOS>
He
have
those
to
please
who
must
be
pleased
,
and
who
(
between
ourselves
)
be
sometimes
to
be
please
only
by
a
good
many
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
but
now
I
have
no
doubt
of
see
him
here
about
the
second
week
in
January
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
very
great
pleasure
it
will
be
to
you
!
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Weston
be
so
anxious
to
be
acquaint
with
him
,
that
she
must
be
almost
as
happy
as
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
she
would
be
,
but
that
she
think
there
will
be
another
put
-
off
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
depend
upon
his
come
so
much
as
I
do
:
but
she
do
not
know
the
party
so
well
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
the
case
,
you
see
,
be
 
(
but
this
be
quite
between
ourselves
:
I
do
not
mention
a
syllable
of
it
in
the
other
room
.
<EOS>
there
be
secret
in
all
family
,
you
know

<EOS>
the
case
be
,
that
a
party
of
friend
be
invite
to
pay
a
visit
at
Enscombe
in
January
;
and
that
Frank
's
come
depend
upon
their
be
put
off
.
<EOS>
if
they
be
not
put
off
,
he
can
not
stir
.
<EOS>
but
I
know
they
will
,
because
it
be
a
family
that
a
certain
lady
,
of
some
consequence
,
at
Enscombe
,
have
a
particular
dislike
to
:
and
though
it
be
think
necessary
to
invite
them
once
in
two
or
three
year
,
they
always
be
put
off
when
it
come
to
the
point
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
small
doubt
of
the
issue
.
<EOS>
I
be
as
confident
of
see
Frank
here
before
the
middle
of
January
,
as
I
be
of
be
here
myself
:
but
your
good
friend
there
(
nod
towards
the
upper
end
of
the
table
)
have
so
few
vagary
herself
,
and
have
be
so
little
used
to
them
at
Hartfield
,
that
she
can
not
calculate
on
their
effect
,
as
I
have
be
long
in
the
practice
of
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
there
should
be
any
thing
like
doubt
in
the
case
,
"
reply
Emma
;
"
but
be
dispose
to
side
with
you
,
Mr.
Weston
.
<EOS>
if
you
think
he
will
come
,
I
shall
think
so
too
;
for
you
know
Enscombe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
 
I
have
some
right
to
that
knowledge
;
though
I
have
never
be
at
the
place
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
an
odd
woman
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
never
allow
myself
to
speak
ill
of
her
,
on
Frank
's
account
;
for
I
do
believe
her
to
be
very
fond
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
use
to
think
she
be
not
capable
of
be
fond
of
any
body
,
except
herself
:
but
she
have
always
be
kind
to
him
(
in
her
way
 
allow
for
little
whim
and
caprice
,
and
expect
every
thing
to
be
as
she
like
)
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
no
small
credit
,
<EOS>
in
my
opinion
,
to
him
,
that
he
should
excite
such
an
affection
;
for
,
though
I
would
not
say
it
to
any
body
else
,
she
have
no
more
heart
than
a
stone
to
people
in
general
;
and
the
devil
of
a
temper
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
like
the
subject
so
well
,
that
she
begin
upon
it
,
to
Mrs.
Weston
,
very
soon
after
their
move
into
the
drawing
-
room
:
wish
her
joy
 
yet
observe
,
that
she
know
the
first
meeting
must
be
rather
alarming
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
agree
to
it
;
but
add
,
that
she
should
be
very
glad
to
be
secure
of
undergo
the
anxiety
of
a
first
meeting
at
the
time
talk
of
:
"
for
I
can
not
depend
upon
his
coming
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
be
so
sanguine
as
Mr.
Weston
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
afraid
that
it
will
all
end
in
nothing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
,
I
dare
say
,
have
be
tell
you
exactly
how
the
matter
stand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
 
it
seem
to
depend
upon
nothing
but
the
ill
-
humour
of
Mrs.
Churchill
,
which
I
imagine
to
be
the
most
certain
thing
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
Emma
!
"
reply
Mrs.
Weston
,
smile
,
"
what
be
the
certainty
of
caprice
?
"
<EOS>
then
turn
to
Isabella
,
who
have
not
be
attend
before
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
know
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Knightley
,
that
we
be
by
no
means
<EOS>
so
sure
of
see
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
,
in
my
opinion
,
as
his
father
think
.
<EOS>
It
depend
entirely
upon
his
aunt
's
spirit
and
pleasure
;
in
short
,
upon
her
temper
.
<EOS>
to
you
 
to
my
two
daughter
 
I
may
venture
on
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Churchill
rule
at
Enscombe
,
and
be
a
very
odd
-
tempered
woman
;
and
his
come
now
,
depend
upon
her
be
willing
to
spare
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mrs.
Churchill
;
every
body
know
Mrs.
Churchill
,
"
reply
Isabella
:
"
and
I
be
sure
I
never
think
of
that
poor
young
man
without
the
great
compassion
.
<EOS>
to
be
constantly
live
with
an
ill
-
temper
person
,
must
be
dreadful
.
<EOS>
It
be
what
we
happily
have
never
know
any
thing
of
;
but
it
must
be
a
life
of
misery
.
<EOS>
what
a
blessing
,
that
she
never
have
any
child
!
<EOS>
poor
little
creature
,
how
unhappy
she
would
have
make
them
!
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
wish
she
have
be
alone
with
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
She
should
then
have
hear
more
:
Mrs.
Weston
would
speak
to
her
,
with
a
degree
of
unreserve
which
she
would
not
hazard
with
Isabella
;
and
,
she
really
believe
,
would
scarcely
try
to
conceal
any
thing
relative
to
the
churchill
from
her
,
except
those
view
on
the
young
man
,
of
which
her
own
imagination
have
already
give
her
such
instinctive
knowledge
.
<EOS>
but
at
present
there
be
nothing
more
to
be
say
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
very
soon
follow
them
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
to
be
sit
long
after
dinner
,
be
a
confinement
that
he
could
not
endure
.
<EOS>
neither
wine
nor
conversation
be
any
thing
to
him
;
and
gladly
do
he
move
to
those
with
whom
he
be
always
comfortable
.
  
<EOS>
while
he
talk
to
Isabella
,
however
,
Emma
find
an
opportunity
of
say
,
  
"
<EOS>
and
so
you
do
not
consider
this
visit
from
your
son
as
by
any
mean
certain
.
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
for
it
.
<EOS>
the
introduction
must
be
unpleasant
,
whenever
it
take
place
;
and
the
sooner
it
could
be
over
,
the
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
and
every
delay
make
one
more
apprehensive
of
other
delay
.
<EOS>
even
if
this
family
,
the
Braithwaites
,
be
put
off
,
I
be
still
afraid
that
some
excuse
may
be
find
for
disappoint
us
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
to
imagine
any
reluctance
on
his
side
;
but
I
be
sure
there
be
a
great
wish
on
the
churchill
'
to
keep
him
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
there
be
jealousy
.
<EOS>
They
be
jealous
even
of
his
regard
for
his
father
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
can
feel
no
dependence
on
his
coming
,
and
I
wish
Mr.
Weston
be
less
sanguine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
ought
to
come
,
"
say
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
if
he
could
stay
only
a
couple
of
day
,
he
ought
to
come
;
and
one
can
hardly
conceive
a
young
man
be
not
have
it
in
his
power
to
do
as
much
as
that
.
<EOS>
a
young
_
woman
_
,
if
she
fall
into
bad
hand
,
may
be
tease
,
and
keep
at
a
distance
from
those
she
want
to
be
with
;
but
one
can
not
comprehend
a
young
_
man
<EOS>
_
be
be
under
such
restraint
,
as
not
to
be
able
to
spend
a
week
with
his
father
,
if
he
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
one
ought
to
be
at
Enscombe
,
and
know
the
way
of
the
family
,
before
one
decide
upon
what
he
can
do
,
"
reply
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
"
one
ought
to
use
the
same
caution
,
perhaps
,
in
judging
of
the
conduct
of
any
one
individual
of
any
one
family
;
but
Enscombe
,
I
believe
,
certainly
must
not
be
judge
by
general
rule
:
_
she
_
be
so
very
unreasonable
;
and
every
thing
give
way
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
she
be
so
fond
of
the
nephew
:
he
be
so
very
great
a
favourite
.
<EOS>
now
,
accord
to
my
idea
of
Mrs.
Churchill
,
it
would
be
most
natural
,
that
while
she
make
no
sacrifice
for
the
comfort
of
the
husband
,
to
whom
she
owe
every
thing
,
while
she
exercise
incessant
caprice
towards
_
him
_
,
she
should
frequently
be
govern
by
the
nephew
,
to
whom
she
owe
nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
emma
,
do
not
pretend
,
with
your
sweet
temper
,
to
understand
a
bad
one
,
or
to
lay
down
rule
for
it
:
you
must
let
it
go
its
own
way
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
of
his
have
,
at
time
,
considerable
influence
;
but
it
may
be
perfectly
impossible
for
him
to
know
beforehand
_
when
_
it
will
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
listen
,
and
then
coolly
say
,
"
I
shall
not
be
satisfied
,
unless
he
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
may
have
a
great
deal
of
influence
on
some
point
,
"
continue
Mrs.
Weston
,
"
and
on
other
,
very
little
:
and
among
those
,
on
which
she
be
beyond
his
reach
,
it
be
but
too
likely
,
may
be
this
very
circumstance
of
his
come
away
from
them
to
visit
us
.
"
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
be
soon
ready
for
his
tea
;
and
when
he
have
drink
his
tea
he
be
quite
ready
to
go
home
;
and
it
be
as
much
as
his
three
companion
could
do
,
to
entertain
away
his
notice
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
,
before
the
other
gentleman
appear
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
be
chatty
and
convivial
,
and
no
friend
to
early
separation
of
any
sort
;
but
at
last
the
drawing
-
room
party
do
receive
an
augmentation
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
,
in
very
good
spirit
,
be
one
of
the
first
to
walk
in
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
and
Emma
be
sit
together
on
a
sofa
.
<EOS>
He
join
them
immediately
,
and
,
with
scarcely
an
invitation
,
seat
himself
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
,
in
good
spirit
too
,
from
the
amusement
afford
her
mind
by
the
expectation
of
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
,
be
willing
to
forget
his
late
impropriety
,
and
be
as
well
satisfied
with
him
as
before
,
and
on
his
make
Harriet
his
very
first
subject
,
be
ready
to
listen
with
most
friendly
smile
.
  
<EOS>
He
profess
himself
extremely
anxious
about
her
fair
friend
 
her
fair
,
lovely
,
amiable
friend
.

"
<EOS>
do
she
know
?
 
<EOS>
have
she
hear
any
thing
about
her
,
since
their
being
at
Randalls
?
 
<EOS>
he
feel
much
anxiety
 
<EOS>
he
must
confess
that
the
nature
of
her
complaint
alarm
him
considerably
.
"
<EOS>
and
in
this
style
he
talk
on
for
some
time
very
properly
,
not
much
attend
to
any
answer
,
but
altogether
sufficiently
awake
to
the
terror
of
a
bad
sore
throat
;
and
Emma
be
quite
in
charity
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
at
last
there
seem
a
perverse
turn
;
it
seem
all
at
once
as
if
he
be
more
afraid
of
its
be
a
bad
sore
throat
on
her
account
,
than
on
Harriet
's
 
more
anxious
that
she
should
escape
the
infection
,
than
that
there
should
be
no
infection
in
the
complaint
.
<EOS>
He
begin
with
great
earnestness
to
entreat
her
to
refrain
from
visit
the
sick
-
chamber
again
,
for
the
present
 
to
entreat
her
to
_
promise
_
_
<EOS>
him
_
<EOS>
not
to
venture
into
such
hazard
till
he
have
see
Mr.
Perry
and
learn
his
opinion
;
and
though
she
try
to
laugh
it
off
and
bring
the
subject
back
into
its
proper
course
,
there
be
no
put
an
end
to
his
extreme
solicitude
about
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
vexed
.
<EOS>
It
do
appear
 
there
be
no
conceal
it
 
exactly
like
the
pretence
of
be
in
love
with
her
,
instead
of
Harriet
;
an
inconstancy
,
if
real
,
the
most
contemptible
and
abominable
!
<EOS>
and
she
have
difficulty
in
behave
with
temper
.
<EOS>
He
turn
to
Mrs.
Weston
to
implore
her
assistance
,
"
Would
not
she
give
him
her
support
?
 
<EOS>
would
not
she
add
her
persuasion
to
his
,
to
induce
Miss
Woodhouse
not
to
go
to
Mrs.
Goddard
's
till
it
be
certain
that
Miss
Smith
's
disorder
have
no
infection

He
could
not
be
satisfied
without
a
promise
 
would
not
she
give
him
her
influence
in
procure
it
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
so
scrupulous
for
other

he
continue
,

and
yet
so
careless
for
herself

She
want
me
to
nurse
my
cold
by
stay
at
home
to

day

yet
will
not
promise
to
avoid
the
danger

catch
an
ulcerated
sore
throat
herself

this
fair

Judge
between
us

have
not
I
some
right
to
complain
?
<EOS>
I
be
sure
of
your
kind
support
and
aid

"
  
<EOS>
Emma
see
Mrs.
Weston
's
surprize
,
and
feel
that
it
must
be
great
,
at
an
address
which
,
in
word
and
manner
,
be
assume
to
himself
the
right
of
first
interest
in
her
;
and
as
for
herself
,
she
be
too
much
provoke
and
offend
to
have
the
power
of
directly
say
any
thing
to
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
She
could
only
give
him
a
look
;
but
it
be
such
a
look
as
she
think
must
restore
him
to
his
sense
,
and
then
leave
the
sofa
,
remove
to
a
seat
by
her
sister
,
and
give
her
all
her
attention
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
not
time
to
know
how
Mr.
Elton
take
the
reproof
,
so
rapidly
do
another
subject
succeed
;
for
Mr.
John
Knightley
now
come
into
the
room
from
examine
the
weather
,
and
open
on
them
all
with
the
information
of
the
ground
be
cover
with
snow
,
and
of
its
still
snow
fast
,
with
a
strong
drifting
wind
;
conclude
with
these
word
to
Mr.
Woodhouse
:
  
"
this
will
prove
a
spirited
beginning
of
your
winter
engagement
,
sir
.
<EOS>
something
new
for
your
coachman
and
horse
to
be
make
their
way
through
a
storm
of
snow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Woodhouse
be
silent
from
consternation
;
but
every
body
else
have
something
to
say
;
every
body
be
either
surprize
or
not
surprize
,
and
have
some
question
to
ask
,
or
some
comfort
to
offer
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
and
Emma
try
earnestly
to
cheer
him
and
turn
his
attention
from
his
son
-
in
-
law
,
who
be
pursue
his
triumph
rather
unfeelingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
admire
your
resolution
very
much
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
in
venture
out
in
such
weather
,
for
of
course
you
see
there
would
be
snow
very
soon
.
<EOS>
every
body
must
have
see
the
snow
come
on
.
<EOS>
I
admire
your
spirit
;
and
I
dare
say
we
shall
get
home
very
well
.
<EOS>
another
hour
or
two
's
snow
can
hardly
make
the
road
impassable
;

Mr.

with
triumph
of
a

be
confess
that
he
have
know
it
to
be
snow
some
time
,
but
have
not
say
a
word
,
lest
it
should
make
Mr.
Woodhouse
uncomfortable
,
and
be
an
excuse
for
his
hurrying
away
.
<EOS>
as
to
there
be
any
quantity
of
snow
fallen
or
likely
to
fall
to
impede
their
return
,
that
be
a
mere
joke
;
he
be
afraid
they
would
find
no
difficulty
.
<EOS>
He
wish
the
road
may
be
impassable
,
that
he
may
be
able
to
keep
them
all
at
randall

and
with
the
utmost
good

will
be
sure
that
accommodation

on
his

that
with
a
little
contrivance

every

may

which
she
hardly
know
how
to

from
the
consciousness
of
there

<EOS>
"
what

,
my

Emma

<EOS>
what
be
to

do

"
be
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
first
exclamation
,
and
all
that
he
could
say
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
to
her
he
look
for
comfort
;
and
her
assurance
of
safety
,
her
representation
of
the
excellence
of
the
horse
,
and
of
James
,
and
of
their

so
many
friend
about
them

revive
him
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
His
eld
daughter
's
alarm
be
equal
to
his
own
.
<EOS>
the
horror
of
be
block
up
at
randall
,
while
her
child
be
at
Hartfield
,
be
full
in
her
imagination
;
and
fancy
the
road
to
be
now
just
passable
for
adventurous
people
,
but
in
a
state
that
admit
no
delay
,
she
be
eager
to
have
it
settle
,
that
her
father
and
Emma
should
remain
at
randall
,
while
she
and
her
husband
set
forward
instantly
through
all
the
possible
accumulation
of
drifted
snow
that
may
impede
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
well
order
the
carriage
directly
,
my

say
she
;
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
we
shall
be
able
to
get
along
,
if
we
set
off
directly
;
and
if
we
do
come
to
any
thing
very
bad
,
I
can
get
out
and
walk
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
at
all
afraid
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
mind
walk
half
the
way
.
<EOS>
I
could
change
my
shoe
,
you
know
,
the
moment
I
get
home
;
and
it
be
not
the

of
thing
that
give
me
cold

"
indeed

reply
he
.
"
<EOS>
then
,
my
dear
Isabella

it
be
the
most
extraordinary

in
general
every

do
give
you

<EOS>
you
be
prettily
shod
for
walk
home
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
bad
enough
for
the
horse
.
"
  
<EOS>
Isabella
turn
to
Mrs.
Weston
for
her
approbation
of
the
plan
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
could
only
approve
.
<EOS>
Isabella
then
go
to
Emma
;
but
Emma
could
not
so
entirely
give
up
the
hope
of
their
be
all
able
to
get
away
;
and
they
be
still
discuss
the
point
,
when
Mr.
Knightley
,
who
have
leave
the
room
immediately
after
his
brother
's
first
report
of
the
snow
,
come
back
again
,
and
tell
them
that
he
have
be
out
of
door
to
examine
,
and
could
answer
for
there
not
be
the
small
difficulty
in
their
get
home
,
whenever
they
like
it
,
either
now
or
an
hour
hence
.
<EOS>
He
have
go
beyond
the
sweep
 
some
way
along
the
Highbury
road
 
<EOS>
the
snow
be
nowhere
above
<EOS>
half
an
inch
deep
 
in
many
place
hardly
enough
to
whiten
the
ground
;
a
very
few
flake
be
fall
at
present
,
but
the
cloud
be
part
,
and
there
be
every
appearance
of
its
being
soon
over
.
<EOS>
He
have
see
the
coachman
,
and
they
both
agree
with
him
in
there
be
nothing
to
apprehend
.
  
<EOS>
to
Isabella
,
the
relief
of
such
tiding
be
very
great
,
and
they
be
scarcely
less
acceptable
to
Emma
on
her
father
's
account
,
who
be
immediately
set
as
much
at
ease
on
the
subject
as
his
nervous
constitution
allow
;
but
the
alarm
that
have
be
raise
could
not
be
appease
so
as
to
admit
of
any
comfort
for
him
while
he
continue
at
randall
.
<EOS>
He
be
satisfied
of
there
be
no
present
danger
in
return
home
,
but
no
assurance
could
convince
him
that
it
be
safe
to
stay
;
and
while
the
other
be
variously
urge
and
recommend
,
Mr.
Knightley
and
Emma
settle
it
in
a
few
brief
sentence
:
thus
    
"
Your
father
will
not
be
easy
;
why
do
not
you
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
ready
,
if
the
other
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
ring
the
bell
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
the
bell
be
rung
,
and
the
carriage
speak
for
.
<EOS>
a
few
minute
more
,
and
Emma
hope
to
see
one
troublesome
companion
deposit
in
his
own
house
,
to
get
sober
and
cool
,
and
the
other
recover
his
temper
and
happiness
when
this
visit
of
hardship
be
over
.
  
<EOS>
the
carriage
come
:
and
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
always
the
first
object
on
such
occasion
,
be
carefully
attend
to
his
own
by
Mr.
Knightley
and
Mr.
Weston
;
but
not
all
that
either
could
say
could
prevent
some
renewal
of
alarm
at
the
sight
of
the
snow
which
have
actually
fall
,
and
the
discovery
of
a
much
dark
night
than
he
have
be
prepare
for
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
afraid
they
should
have
a
very
bad
drive
.
<EOS>
He
be
afraid
poor
Isabella
would
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
and
there
would
be
poor
Emma
in
the
carriage
behind
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
what
they
have
best
do
.
<EOS>
They
must
keep
as
much
together
as
they
could
;
"
and
James
be
talk
to
,
and
give
a
charge
to
go
very
slow
and
wait
for
the
other
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
Isabella
stept
in
after
her
father
;
John
Knightley
,
forget
that
he
do
not
belong
to
their
party
,
stept
in
after
his
wife
very
naturally
;
so
that
Emma
find
,
on
be
escort
and
follow
into
the
second
carriage
by
Mr.
Elton
,
that
the
door
be
to
be
lawfully
shut
on
them
,
and
that
they
be
to
have
a
tete
-
a
-
tete
drive
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
have
be
the
awkwardness
of
a
moment
,
it
would
have
be
rather
a
pleasure
,
previous
to
the
suspicion
of
this
very
day
;
she
could
have
talk
to
him
of
Harriet
,
and
the
three
-
quarter
of
a
mile
would
have
seem
but
one
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
she
would
rather
it
have
not
happen
.
<EOS>
She
believe
he
have
be
drink
too
much
of
Mr.
Weston
's
good
wine
,
and
feel
sure
that
he
would
want
to
be
talk
nonsense
.
  
<EOS>
to
restrain
him
as
much
as
may
be
,
by
her
own
manner
,
she
be
immediately
prepare
to
speak
with
exquisite
calmness
and
gravity
of
the
weather
and
the
night
;
but
scarcely
have
she
begin
,
scarcely
have
they
pass
the
sweep
-
gate
and
join
the
other
carriage
,
than
she
find
her
subject
cut
up
 
her
hand
seize
 
her
attention
demand
,
and
Mr.
Elton
actually
make
violent
love
to
her
:
avail
himself
of
the
precious
opportunity
,
declare
sentiment
which
must
be
already
well
know
,
hope
 
fear
 
adore
 
ready
to
die
if
she
refuse
him
;
but
flatter
himself
that
his
ardent
attachment
and
unequalle
love
and
unexampled
passion
could
not
fail
of
have
some
effect
,
and
in
short
,
very
much
resolve
on
be
seriously
accept
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
It
really
be
so
.
<EOS>
without
scruple
 
without
apology
 
without
much
apparent
diffidence
,
Mr.
Elton
,
the
lover
of
Harriet
,
be
profess
himself
_
<EOS>
her
_
lover
.
<EOS>
She
try
to
stop
him
;
but
vainly
;
he
would
go
on
,
and
say
it
all
.
<EOS>
angry
as
she
be
,
the
thought
of
the
moment
make
her
resolve
to
restrain
herself
when
she
do
speak
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
half
this
folly
must
be
drunkenness
,
and
therefore
could
hope
that
it
may
belong
only
to
the
pass
hour
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
with
a
mixture
of
the
serious
and
the
playful
,
which
she
hope
would
best
suit
his
half
and
half
state
,
she
reply
,
  
"
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
astonish

Mr.
Elton

me
for

<EOS>
and
he
repeat
her
word
with
such
assurance
of
accent
,
such
boastful
pretence
of
amazement
,
that
she
could
not
help
reply
with
quickness
,
  
"
Mr.
Elton
<EOS>
,
this
be
the
most
extraordinary
conduct
!
<EOS>
and
I
can
account
for
it
only
in
one
way
;
you
be
not
yourself
,
or
you
could
not
speak
either
to
me
,
or
of
Harriet
,
in
such
a
manner
.
<EOS>
command
yourself
enough
to
say
no
more
,
and
I
will
endeavour
to
forget
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Elton
have
only
drunk
wine
enough
to
elevate
his
spirit
,
not
at
all
to
confuse
his
intellect
.
<EOS>
He
perfectly
know
his
own
meaning
;
and
have
warmly
protest
against
her
suspicion
as
most
injurious
,
and
slightly
touch
upon
his
respect
for
Miss
Smith
as
her
friend
,
 
but
acknowledge
his
wonder
that
Miss
Smith
should
be
mention
at
all
,
 
he
resume
the
subject
of
his
own
passion
,
and
be
very
urgent
for
a
favourable
answer
.
  
<EOS>
as
she
think
less
of
his
inebriety
,
she
think
more
of
his
inconstancy
and
presumption
;
and
with
few
struggle
for
politeness
,
reply
,
  
"
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
me
to
doubt
any
longer

You
have
make
yourself
too
clear

Mr.
Elton
,
my
astonishment
be
much
beyond
any

can
express

after
such
behaviour

as
I
have
witness
during

attention

I
have
be
in
the
daily
habit

this

an
unsteadiness

believe
me

I
be

Good

cry
Mr.

what
can
be
the
meaning
of
this

I
never

there
be
no
unsteadiness

<EOS>
I
have
think
only
of
you

<EOS>
I
protest
against

every

no

unpleasant

uppermost

She
be

encouragement
!
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
you
have
be
entirely
mistake
in
suppose
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
you
only
as
the
admirer
of
my
friend
.
<EOS>
in
no
other
light
could
you
have
be
more
to
me
than
a
common
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
I
be
exceedingly
sorry
:
but
it
be
well
that
the
mistake
end
where
it
do
.
<EOS>
have
the
same
behaviour
continue
,
Miss
Smith
may
have
be
lead
into
a
misconception
of
your
view
;
not
be
aware
,
probably
,
any
more
than
myself
,
of
the
very
great
inequality
which
you
be
so
sensible
of
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
it
be
,
the
disappointment
be
single
,
and
,
I
trust
,
will
not
be
last
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
thought
of
matrimony
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
too
angry
to
say
another
word
;
her
manner
too
decide
to
invite
supplication
;
and
in
this
state
of
swell
resentment
,
and
mutually
deep
mortification
,
they
have
to
continue
together
a
few
minute
longer
,
for
the
fear
of
Mr.
Woodhouse
<EOS>
have
confine
them
to
a
foot
-
pace
.
<EOS>
if
there
have
not
be
so
much
anger
,
there
would
have
be
desperate
awkwardness
;
but
their
straightforward
emotion
leave
no
room
for
the
little
zigzag
of
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
without
know
when
the
carriage
turn
into
Vicarage
Lane
,
or
when
it
stop
,
they
find
themselves
,
all
at
once
,
at
the
door
of
his
house
;
and
he
be
out
before
another
syllable
pass
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
then
feel
it
indispensable
to
wish
him
a
good
night
.
<EOS>
the
compliment
be
just
return
,
coldly
and
proudly
;
and
,
under
indescribable
irritation
of
spirit
,
she
be
then
convey
to
Hartfield
.
  
<EOS>
there
she
be
welcome
,
with
the
utmost
delight
,
by
her
father
,
who
have
be
tremble
for
the
danger
of
a
solitary
drive
from
Vicarage
Lane
 
turn
a
corner
which
he
could
never
bear
to
think
of
 
and
in
strange
hand
 
a
mere
common
coachman
 
<EOS>
no
James
<EOS>
;
and
there
it
seem
as
if
her
return
only
be
want
to
make
every
thing
go
well
:
for
Mr.
John
Knightley
,
ashamed
of
his
ill
-
humour
,
be
now
all
kindness
and
attention
;
and
so
particularly
solicitous
for
the
comfort
of
her
father
,
as
to
seem
 
if
not
quite
ready
to
join
him
in
a
basin
of
gruel
 
perfectly
sensible
of
its
be
exceedingly
wholesome
;
and
the
day
be
conclude
in
peace
and
comfort
to
all
their
little
party
,
except
herself
.
 
<EOS>
but
her
mind
have
never
be
in
such
perturbation
;
and
it
need
a
very
strong
effort
to
appear
attentive
and
cheerful
till
the
usual
hour
of
separating
allow
her
the
relief
of
quiet
reflection
.
    
<EOS>
the
hair
be
curl
,
and
the
maid
send
away
,
and
Emma
sit
down
to
think
and
be
miserable
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
wretched
business
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
such
an
overthrow
of
every
thing
she
have
be
wish
for
!
 
<EOS>
such
a
development
of
every
thing
most
unwelcome
!
 
<EOS>
such
a
blow
for
Harriet
!
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
bad
of
all
.
<EOS>
every
part
of
it
bring
pain
and
humiliation
,
of
some
sort
or
other
;
but
,
compare
with
the
evil
to
Harriet
,
all
be
light
;
and
she
would
gladly
have
submit
to
feel
yet
more
mistaken
 
more
in
error
 
more
disgrace
by
mis
-
judgment
,
than
she
actually
be
,
could
the
effect
of
her
blunder
have
be
confine
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
have
not
persuade
Harriet
into
like
the
man
,
I
could
have
bear
any
thing
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
double
his
presumption
to
me
 
but
poor
Harriet
!
"
  
<EOS>
how
she
could
have
be
so
deceive
!
 
<EOS>
He
protest
that
he
have
never
think
seriously
of
Harriet
 
never
!
<EOS>
She
look
back
as
well
as
she
could
;
but
it
be
all
confusion
.
<EOS>
She
have
take
up
the
idea
,
she
suppose
,
and
make
every
thing
bend
to
it
.
<EOS>
His
manner
,
however
,
must
have
be
unmarke
,
wavering
,
dubious
,
or
<EOS>
she
could
not
have
be
so
mislead
.
  
<EOS>
the
picture
!
 
<EOS>
how
eager
he
have
be
about
the
picture
!
 
and
the
charade
!
 
<EOS>
and
an
hundred
other
circumstance
;
 
<EOS>
how
clearly
they
have
seem
to
point
at
Harriet
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
the
charade
,
with
its
"
ready
wit
"
 
but
then
the
"
soft
eye
"
 
<EOS>
in
fact
it
suit
neither
;
it
be
a
jumble
without
taste
or
truth
.
<EOS>
who
could
have
see
through
such
thick
-
headed
nonsense
?
  
<EOS>
certainly
she
have
often
,
especially
of
late
,
think
his
manner
to
herself
unnecessarily
gallant
;
but
it
have
pass
as
his
way
,
as
a
mere
error
of
judgment
,
of
knowledge
,
of
taste
,
as
one
proof
among
other
that
he
have
not
always
live
in
the
good
society
,
that
with
all
the
gentleness
of
his
address
,
true
elegance
be
sometimes
want
;
but
,
till
this
very
day
,
she
have
never
,
for
an
instant
,
suspect
it
to
mean
any
thing
but
grateful
respect
to
her
as
Harriet
's
friend
.
  
<EOS>
to
Mr.
John
Knightley
be
she
indebte
for
her
first
idea
on
the
subject
,
for
the
first
start
of
its
possibility
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
deny
that
those
brother
have
penetration
.
<EOS>
She
remember
what
Mr.
Knightley
have
once
say
to
her
about
Mr.
Elton
,
the
caution
he
have
give
,
the
conviction
he
have
profess
that
Mr.
Elton
would
never
marry
indiscreetly
;
and
blush
to
think
how
much
true
a
knowledge
of
his
character
have
be
there
shew
than
any
she
have
reach
herself
.
<EOS>
It
be
dreadfully
mortify
;
but
Mr.
Elton
be
prove
himself
,
in
many
respect
,
the
very
reverse
of
what
she
have
mean
and
believe
him
;
proud
,
assume
,
conceited
;
very
full
of
his
own
claim
,
and
little
concerned
about
the
feeling
of
other
.
  
<EOS>
Contrary
to
the
usual
course
of
thing
,
Mr.
Elton
's
want
to
pay
his
address
to
her
have
sink
him
in
her
opinion
.
<EOS>
His
profession
and
his
proposal
do
him
no
service
.
<EOS>
She
think
nothing
of
his
attachment
,
and
be
insult
by
his
hope
.
<EOS>
He
want
to
marry
well
,
and
have
the
arrogance
to
raise
his
eye
to
her
,
pretend
to
be
in
love
;
but
she
be
perfectly
easy
as
to
his
not
suffer
any
disappointment
that
nee
be
care
for
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
no
real
affection
either
in
his
language
or
manner
.
<EOS>
sigh
and
fine
word
have
be
give
in
abundance
;
but
she
could
hardly
devise
any
set
of
expression
,
or
fancy
any
tone
of
voice
,
less
allied
with
real
love
.
<EOS>
She
nee
not
trouble
herself
to
pity
him
.
<EOS>
He
only
want
to
aggrandise
and
enrich
himself
;
and
if
Miss
Woodhouse
of
Hartfield
,
the
heiress
of
thirty
thousand
pound
,
be
not
quite
so
easily
obtain
as
he
have
fancy
,
he
would
soon
try
for
Miss
Somebody
else
with
twenty
,
or
with
ten
.
  
<EOS>
but
 
that
he
should
talk
of
encouragement
,
should
consider
her
as
aware
of
his
view
,
accept
his
attention
,
mean
(
in
short
)
,
to
marry
him
!
 
<EOS>
should
suppose
himself
her
equal
in
connexion
or
mind
!
 
<EOS>
look
down
upon
her
friend
,
so
well
understand
the
gradation
of
rank
below
him
,
and
be
so
blind
to
what
rise
above
,
as
to
fancy
himself
shew
no
presumption
in
address
her
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
most
provoking
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
not
fair
to
expect
him
to
feel
how
very
much
he
be
her
inferior
in
talent
,
and
all
the
elegancie
of
mind
.
<EOS>
the
very
want
of
such
equality
may
prevent
his
perception
of
it
;
but
he
must
know
that
in
fortune
and
consequence
she
be
greatly
his
superior
.
<EOS>
He
must
know
that
the
Woodhouses
have
be
settle
for
several
generation
at
Hartfield
,
the
young
branch
of
a
very
ancient
family
 
and
that
the
elton
be
nobody
.
<EOS>
the
landed
property
of
Hartfield
certainly
be
inconsiderable
,
be
but
a
sort
of
notch
in
the
Donwell
Abbey
estate
,
to
which
all
the
rest
of
Highbury
belong
;
but
their
fortune
,
from
other
source
,
be
such
as
to
make
them
scarcely
secondary
to
Donwell
Abbey
itself
,
in
every
other
kind
of
consequence
;
and
the
Woodhouses
have
long
hold
a
high
place
in
the
consideration
of
the
neighbourhood
which
Mr.
Elton
have
first
enter
not
two
year
ago
,
to
make
his
way
as
he
could
,
without
any
alliance
but
in
trade
,
or
any
thing
to
recommend
him
to
notice
<EOS>
but
his
situation
and
his
civility
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
fancy
her
in
love
with
him
;
that
evidently
must
have
be
his
dependence
;
and
after
rave
a
little
about
the
seeming
incongruity
of
gentle
manner
and
a
conceited
head
,
Emma
be
oblige
in
common
honesty
to
stop
and
admit
that
her
own
behaviour
to
him
have
be
so
complaisant
and
obliging
,
so
full
of
courtesy
and
attention
,
as
(
suppose
her
real
motive
unperceived
)
may
warrant
a
man
of
ordinary
observation
and
delicacy
,
like
Mr.
Elton
,
in
fancy
himself
a
very
decided
favourite
.
<EOS>
if
_
she
_
have
so
misinterpret
his
feeling
,
she
have
little
right
to
wonder
that
_
<EOS>
he
_
,
with
self
-
interest
to
blind
him
,
should
have
mistake
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
error
and
the
bad
lie
at
her
door
.
<EOS>
It
be
foolish
,
it
be
wrong
,
to
take
so
active
a
part
in
bring
any
two
people
together
.
<EOS>
It
be
adventure
too
far
,
assume
too
much
,
make
light
of
what
ought
to
be
serious
,
a
trick
of
what
ought
to
be
simple
.
<EOS>
She
be
quite
concerned
and
ashamed
,
and
resolve
to
do
such
thing
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
have
I
,
"
say
she
,
"
actually
talk
poor
Harriet
into
be
very
much
attach
to
this
man
.
<EOS>
She
may
never
have
think
of
him
but
for
me
;
and
certainly
never
would
have
think
of
him
with
hope
,
if
I
have
not
assure
her
of
his
attachment
,
for
she
be
as
modest
and
humble
as
I
use
to
think
him
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
that
I
have
be
satisfied
with
persuade
her
not
to
accept
young
Martin
.
<EOS>
there
I
be
quite
right
.
<EOS>
that
be
well
do
of
me
;
but
there
I
should
have
stop
,
and
leave
the
rest
to
time
and
chance
.
<EOS>
I
be
introduce
her
into
good
company
,
and
give
her
the
opportunity
of
please
some
one
worth
have
;
I
ought
not
to
have
attempt
more
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
poor
girl
,
her
peace
be
cut
up
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
but
half
a
friend
to
her
;
and
if
she
be
_
not
_
to
feel
this
disappointment
so
very
much
,
I
be
sure
I
have
not
an
idea
of
any
body
else
who
would
be
at
all
desirable
for
her
;
 
William
Coxe
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
no
,
I
could
not
endure
William
Coxe
 
<EOS>
a
pert
young
lawyer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
stopt
to
blush
and
laugh
at
her
own
relapse
,
and
then
resume
a
more
serious
,
more
dispirit
cogitation
upon
what
have
be
,
and
may
be
,
and
must
be
.
<EOS>
the
distress
explanation
she
have
to
make
to
Harriet
,
and
all
that
poor
Harriet
would
be
suffer
,
with
the
awkwardness
of
future
meeting
,
the
difficulty
of
continue
or
discontinue
the
acquaintance
,
of
subdue
feeling
,
conceal
resentment
,
and
avoid
eclat
,
be
enough
to
occupy
her
in
most
unmirthful
reflection
some
time
longer
,
and
she
go
to
bed
at
last
with
nothing
settle
but
the
conviction
of
her
have
blunder
most
dreadfully
.
  
<EOS>
to
youth
and
natural
cheerfulness
like
Emma
's
,
though
under
temporary
gloom
at
night
,
the
return
of
day
will
hardly
fail
to
bring
return
of
spirit
.
<EOS>
the
youth
and
cheerfulness
of
morning
be
in
happy
analogy
,
and
of
powerful
operation
;
and
if
the
distress
be
not
poignant
enough
to
keep
the
eye
unclosed
,
they
will
be
sure
to
open
to
sensation
of
softened
pain
and
bright
hope
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
get
up
on
the
morrow
more
disposed
for
comfort
than
she
have
go
to
bed
,
more
ready
to
see
alleviation
of
the
evil
before
her
,
and
to
depend
on
get
tolerably
out
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
consolation
that
Mr.
Elton
should
not
be
really
in
love
with
her
,
or
so
particularly
amiable
as
to
make
it
shocking
to
disappoint
him
 
that
Harriet
's
nature
should
not
be
of
that
superior
sort
in
which
the
feeling
be
most
acute
and
retentive
 
and
that
there
could
be
no
necessity
for
any
body
's
know
what
have
pass
except
the
three
principal
,
and
especially
for
her
father
's
be
give
a
moment
's
uneasiness
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
very
cheer
thought
;
and
the
sight
of
a
great
deal
of
snow
on
the
ground
do
her
further
service
,
for
any
thing
be
welcome
that
may
justify
their
all
three
be
quite
asunder
at
present
.
  
<EOS>
the
weather
be
most
favourable
for
her
;
though
Christmas
Day
,
she
could
not
go
to
church
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
would
have
be
miserable
have
his
daughter
attempt
it
,
and
she
be
therefore
safe
from
either
exciting
or
receive
unpleasant
and
most
unsuitable
idea
.
<EOS>
the
ground
cover
with
snow
,
and
the
atmosphere
in
that
unsettled
state
between
frost
and
thaw
,
which
be
of
all
other
the
most
unfriendly
for
exercise
,
every
morning
begin
in
rain
or
snow
,
and
every
evening
set
in
to
freeze
,
she
be
for
many
day
a
most
honourable
prisoner
.
<EOS>
no
intercourse
with
Harriet
possible
but
by
note
;
no
church
for
her
on
Sunday
any
more
than
on
Christmas
Day
;
and
no
need
to
find
excuse
for
Mr.
Elton
's
absent
himself
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
weather
which
may
fairly
confine
every
body
at
home
;
and
though
she
hope
and
believe
him
to
be
really
take
comfort
in
some
society
or
other
,
it
be
very
pleasant
to
have
her
father
so
well
satisfied
with
his
be
all
alone
in
his
own
house
,
too
wise
to
stir
out
;
and
to
hear
him
say
to
Mr.
Knightley
,
whom
no
weather
could
keep
entirely
from
them
,
    
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
,
why
do

"
  
<EOS>
these
day
of
confinement
would
have
be
,
but
for
her
private
perplexity
,
remarkably
comfortable
,
as
such
seclusion
exactly
suit
her
brother

whose
feeling
must
always
be
of
great
importance
to
his
companion

have
,
besides

so
thoroughly
clear
off
his
ill

agreeable

comfort

such
an
evil
hang
over

hour
of
explanation

the
evening

Emma
be
most
agreeably
surprize

<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
's
absence
just
at
this
time
be
the
very
thing
to
be
desire
.
<EOS>
She
admire
him
for
contrive
it
,
though
not
able
to
give
him
much
credit
for
the
manner
in
which
it
be
announce
.
<EOS>
resentment
could
not
have
be
more
plainly
speak
than
in
a
civility
to
her
father
,
from
which
she
be
so
pointedly
exclude
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
even
a
share
in
his
opening
compliment
.
 
<EOS>
Her
name
be
not
mention
;
 
and
there
be
so
strike
a
change
in
all
this
,
and
such
an
ill
-
judged
solemnity
of
leave
-
taking
in
his
graceful
acknowledgment
,
as
she
think
,
at
first
,
could
not
escape
her
father
's
suspicion
.
  
<EOS>
It
do
,
however
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
be
quite
take
up
with
the
surprize
of
so
sudden
a
journey
,
and
his
fear
that
Mr.
Elton
may
never
get
safely
to
the
end
of
it
,
and
see
nothing
extraordinary
in
his
language
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
useful
note
,
for
it
supply
them
with
fresh
matter
for
thought
and
conversation
during
the
rest
of
their
lonely
evening
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
talk
over
his
alarm
,
and
Emma
be
in
spirit
to
persuade
them
away
with
all
her
usual
promptitude
.
  
<EOS>
She
now
resolve
to
keep
Harriet
no
longer
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
She
have
reason
to
believe
her
nearly
recover
from
her
cold
,
and
it
be
desirable
that
she
should
have
as
much
time
as
possible
for
get
the
well
of
her
other
complaint
before
the
gentleman
's
return
.
<EOS>
She
go
to
Mrs.
Goddard
's
accordingly
the
very
next
day
,
to
undergo
the
necessary
penance
of
communication
;
and
a
severe
one
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
to
destroy
all
the
hope
which
she
have
be
so
industriously
feed
 
to
appear
in
the
ungracious
character
of
the
one
prefer
 
and
acknowledge
herself
grossly
mistaken
and
mis
-
judging
in
all
her
idea
on
one
subject
,
all
her
observation
,
all
her
conviction
,
all
her
prophecy
for
the
last
six
week
.
  
<EOS>
the
confession
completely
renew
her
first
shame
 
and
the
sight
of
Harriet
's
tear
make
her
think
that
she
should
never
be
in
charity
with
herself
again
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
bear
the
intelligence
very
well
 
blame
nobody
 
and
in
every
thing
testify
such
an
ingenuousness
of
disposition
and
lowly
opinion
of
herself
,
as
must
appear
with
particular
advantage
at
that
moment
to
her
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
be
in
the
humour
to
value
simplicity
and
modesty
to
the
utmost
;
and
all
that
be
amiable
,
all
that
ought
to
be
attach
,
seem
on
Harriet
's
side
,
not
her
own
.
<EOS>
Harriet
do
not
consider
herself
as
have
any
thing
to
complain
of
.
<EOS>
the
affection
of
such
a
man
as
Mr.
Elton
would
have
be
too
great
a
distinction
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
could
have
deserve
him
 
and
nobody
but
so
partial
and
kind
a
friend
as
Miss
Woodhouse
would
have
think
it
possible
.
  
<EOS>
Her
tear
fall
abundantly
 
but
her
grief
be
so
truly
artless
,
that
no
dignity
could
have
make
it
more
respectable
in
Emma
's
eye
 
and
she
listen
to
her
and
try
to
console
her
with
all
her
heart
and
understanding
 
really
for
the
time
convince
that
Harriet
be
the
superior
creature
of
the
two
 
and
that
to
resemble
her
would
be
more
for
her
own
welfare
and
happiness
than
all
that
genius
or
intelligence
could
do
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
rather
too
late
in
the
day
to
set
about
be
simple
-
minded
and
ignorant
;
but
she
leave
her
with
every
previous
resolution
confirm
of
be
humble
and
discreet
,
and
repress
imagination
all
the
rest
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
Her
second
duty
now
,
inferior
only
to
her
father
's
claim
,
be
to
promote
Harriet
's
comfort
,
and
endeavour
to
prove
her
own
affection
in
some
well
method
than
by
match
-
making
.
<EOS>
She
get
her
to
Hartfield
,
and
shew
her
the
most
unvarying
kindness
,
strive
to
occupy
and
amuse
her
,
and
by
book
and
conversation
,
to
drive
Mr.
Elton
from
her
thought
.
  
<EOS>
Time
,
she
know
,
must
be
allow
for
this
be
thoroughly
do
;
and
she
could
suppose
herself
but
an
indifferent
judge
of
such
matter
in
general
,
and
very
inadequate
to
sympathise
in
an
attachment
to
Mr.
Elton
in
particular
;
but
it
seem
to
her
reasonable
that
at
Harriet
's
age
,
and
with
the
entire
extinction
of
all
hope
,
such
a
progress
may
be
make
towards
a
state
of
composure
by
the
time
of
Mr.
Elton
's
return
,
as
to
allow
them
all
to
meet
again
in
the
common
routine
of
acquaintance
,
without
any
danger
of
betray
sentiment
or
increase
them
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
do
think
him
all
perfection
,
and
maintain
the
non
-
existence
of
any
body
equal
to
him
in
person
or
goodness
 
and
do
,
in
truth
,
prove
herself
more
resolutely
in
love
than
Emma
have
foresee
;
but
yet
it
appear
to
her
<EOS>
so
natural
,
so
inevitable
to
strive
against
an
inclination
of
that
sort
_
unrequited
_
,
that
she
could
not
comprehend
its
continue
very
long
in
equal
force
.
  
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Elton
,
on
his
return
,
make
his
own
indifference
as
evident
and
indubitable
as
she
could
not
doubt
he
would
anxiously
do
,
she
could
not
imagine
Harriet
's
persist
to
place
her
happiness
in
the
sight
or
the
recollection
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
Their
be
fix
,
so
absolutely
fix
,
in
the
same
place
,
be
bad
for
each
,
for
all
three
.
<EOS>
not
one
of
them
have
the
power
of
removal
,
or
of
effect
any
material
change
of
society
.
<EOS>
They
must
encounter
each
other
,
and
make
the
good
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
be
farther
unfortunate
in
the
tone
of
her
companion
at
Mrs.
Goddard
's
;
Mr.
Elton
be
the
adoration
of
all
the
teacher
and
great
girl
in
the
school
;
and
it
must
be
at
Hartfield
only
that
she
could
have
any
chance
of
hear
him
speak
of
with
cool
moderation
or
repellent
truth
.
<EOS>
where
the
wound
have
be
give
,
there
must
the
cure
be
find
if
anywhere
;
and
Emma
feel
that
,
till
she
see
her
in
the
way
of
cure
,
there
could
be
no
true
peace
for
herself
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
do
not
come
.
<EOS>
when
the
time
propose
draw
near
,
Mrs.
Weston
's
fear
be
justify
in
the
arrival
of
a
letter
of
excuse
.
<EOS>
for
the
present
,
he
could
not
be
spare
,
to
his
"
very
great
mortification
and
regret
;
but
still
he
look
forward
with
the
hope
of
come
to
randall
at
no
distant
period
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
be
exceedingly
disappointed
 
<EOS>
much
more
disappointed
,
in
fact
,
than
her
husband
,
though
her
dependence
on
see
the
young
man
have
be
so
much
more
sober
:
but
a
sanguine
temper
,
though
for
ever
expect
more
good
than
occur
,
do
not
always
pay
for
its
hope
by
any
proportionate
depression
.
<EOS>
It
soon
fly
over
the
present
failure
,
and
begin
to
hope
again
.
<EOS>
for
half
an
hour
Mr.
Weston
be
surprize
and
sorry
;
but
then
he
begin
to
perceive
that
Frank
's
come
two
or
three
month
later
would
be
a
much
well
plan
;
well
time
of
year
;
well
weather
;
and
that
he
would
be
able
,
without
any
doubt
,
to
stay
considerably
long
with
them
than
if
he
have
come
sooner
.
  
<EOS>
these
feeling
rapidly
restore
his
comfort
,
while
Mrs.
Weston
,
of
a
more
apprehensive
disposition
,
foresaw
nothing
but
a
repetition
of
excuse
and
delay
;
and
after
all
her
concern
for
what
her
husband
be
to
suffer
,
suffer
a
great
deal
more
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
be
not
at
this
time
in
a
state
of
spirit
to
care
really
about
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
be
not
come
,
except
as
a
disappointment
at
randall
.
<EOS>
the
acquaintance
at
present
have
no
charm
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
want
,
rather
,
to
be
quiet
,
and
out
of
temptation
;
but
still
,
as
it
be
desirable
that
she
should
appear
,
in
general
,
like
her
usual
self
,
she
take
care
to
express
as
much
interest
in
the
circumstance
,
and
enter
as
warmly
into
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
's
disappointment
,
as
may
naturally
belong
to
their
friendship
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
the
first
to
announce
it
to
Mr.
Knightley
;
and
exclaim
quite
as
much
as
be
necessary
,
(
or
,
be
act
a
part
,
perhaps
rather
more
,
)
at
the
conduct
of
the
Churchills
,
in
keep
him
away
.
<EOS>
She
then
proceed
to
say
a
good
deal
more
than
she
feel
,
of
the
advantage
of
such
an
addition
to
their
confine
society
in
Surry
;
the
pleasure
of
look
at
somebody
new
;
the
gala
-
day
to
Highbury
entire
,
which
the
sight
of
him
would
have
make
;
and
end
with
reflection
on
the
churchill
again
,
find
herself
directly
involve
in
a
disagreement
with
Mr.
Knightley
;
and
,
to
her
great
amusement
,
perceive
that
she
be
take
the
other
side
of
the
question
from
her
real
opinion
,
and
make
use
of
Mrs.
Weston
's
argument
against
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
churchill
be
very
likely
in
fault
,
"
say
Mr.
Knightley
,
coolly
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
dare
say
he
may
come
if
he
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
why
you
should
say
so
.
<EOS>
He
wish
exceedingly
to
come
;
but
his
uncle
and
aunt
will
not
spare
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
believe
that
he
have
not
the
power
of
come
,
if
he
make
a
point
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
unlikely
,
for
me
to
believe
it
without
proof
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
odd
you
be
!
<EOS>
what
have
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
do
,
to
make
you
suppose
him
such
an
unnatural
creature
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
suppose
him
at
all
an
unnatural
creature
,
in
suspect
that
he
may
have
learn
to
be
above
his
connexion
,
and
to
care
very
little
for
any
thing
but
his
own
pleasure
,
from
live
with
those
who
have
always
set
him
the
example
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
deal
more
natural
than
one
could
wish
,
that
a
young
man
,
bring
up
by
those
who
be
proud
,
luxurious
,
and
selfish
,
should
be
proud
,
luxurious
,

selfish
too

<EOS>
if
Frank
Churchill
have
want
to
see
his
father
,
he
would
have
contrive
it
between
September
and
January
.
<EOS>
a
man
at
his
age
 
<EOS>
what
be
he
?
 
<EOS>
three
or
four
-
and
-
twenty
 
can
not
be
without
the
mean
of
do
as
much
as
that

It
be
impossible

"
  
<EOS>
"
that

easily
say

easily

by
you

You
be
the
bad
judge
in
the
world
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
of
the
difficulty
of
dependence

<EOS>
You
do
not
know
what
it
be
to
have
temper

manage

It
be
not

conceive
that
a

not

liberty

he

be
glad
to
get
rid

idle

can

It
be
very
unfair
to

nobody

her
nephew
can

He
may

at
time

be
able
to
do
a

deal
more
than
he
can

"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
one
thing
,
Emma
,
which
a
man
can
always
do
,
if
he
chuse
,
and
that
is
,
his
duty
;
not
by
manoeuvre
and
finessing
,
but
by
vigour
and
resolution
.
<EOS>
It
be
Frank
Churchill
's
duty
to
pay
this
attention
to
his
father
.
<EOS>
He
know
it
to
be
so
,
by
his
promise
and
message
;
but
if
he
wish
to
do
it
,
it
may
be
do
.
<EOS>
a
man
who
feel
rightly
would
say
at
once
,
simply
and
resolutely
,
to
Mrs.
Churchill
 
<EOS>
"
every
sacrifice
of
mere
pleasure
you
will
always
find
me
ready
to
make
to
your
convenience
;
but
I
must
go
and
see
my
father
immediately
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
would
be
hurt
by
my
failing
in
such
a
mark
of
respect
to
him
on
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
shall
,
therefore
,
set
off
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
 
if
he
would
say
so
to
her
at
once
,
in
the
tone
of
decision
become
a
man
,
there
would
be
no
opposition
make
to
his
going

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Emma
,
laugh
;
"
but
perhaps
there
may
be
some
make
to
his
come
back
again
.
<EOS>
such
language
for
a
young
man
entirely
dependent
,
to
use
!
 
<EOS>
nobody
but
you
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
would
imagine
it
possible
.
<EOS>
but
you
have
not
an
idea
of
what
be
requisite
in
situation
directly
opposite
to
your
own
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
to
be
make
such
a
speech
as
that
to
the
uncle
and
aunt
,
who
have
bring
him
up
,
and
be
to
provide
for
him
!
 
<EOS>
stand
up
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
I
suppose
,
and
speak
as
loud
as
he
could
!
 
<EOS>
how
can
you
imagine
such
conduct
practicable
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
depend
upon
it
,
Emma
,
a
sensible
man
would
find
no
difficulty
in
it
.
<EOS>
He
would
feel
himself
in
the
right
;
and
the
declaration
 
make
,
of
course
,
as
a
man
of
sense
would
make
it
,
in
a
proper
manner
 
would
do
him
more
good
,
raise
him
high
,
fix
his
interest
strong
with
the
people
he
depend
on
,
than
all
that
a
line
of
shift
and
expedient
can
ever
do
.
<EOS>
respect
would
be
add
to
affection
.
<EOS>
They
would
feel
that
they
could
trust
him
;
that
the
nephew
who
have
do
rightly
by
his
father
,
would
do
rightly
by
them
;
for
they
know
,
as
well
as
he
do
,
as
well
as
all
the
world
must
know
,
that
he
ought
to
pay
this
visit
to
his
father
;
and
while
meanly
exert
their
power
to
delay
it
,
be
in
their
heart
not
think
the
well
of
him
for
submit
to
their
whim
.
<EOS>
respect
for
right
conduct
be
feel
by
every
body
.
<EOS>
if
he
would
act
in
this
sort
of
manner
,
on
principle
,
consistently
,
regularly
,
their
little
mind
would
bend
to
his
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
rather
doubt
that
.
<EOS>
You
be
very
fond
of
bend
little
mind
;
but
where
little
mind
belong
to
rich
people
in
authority
,
I
think
they
have
a
knack
of
swell
out
,
till
they
be
quite
as
unmanageable
as
great
one
.
<EOS>
I
can
imagine
,
that
if
you
,
as
you
be
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
be
to
be
transport
and
place
all
at
once
in
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
's
situation
,
you
would
be
able
to
say
and
do
just
what
you
have
be
recommend
for
him
;
and
it
may
have
a
very
good
effect
.
<EOS>
the
churchill
may
not
have
a
word
to
say
in
return
;
but
then
,
you
would
have
no
habit
of
early
obedience
and
long
observance
to
break
through
.
<EOS>
to
him
who
have
,
it
may
not
be
so
easy
to
burst
forth
at
once
into
perfect
independence
,
and
set
all
their
claim
on
his
gratitude
and
regard
at
nought
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
as
strong
a
sense
of
what
would
be
right
,
as
you
can
have
,
without
be
so
equal
,
under
particular
circumstance
,
to
act
up
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
it
would
not
be
so
strong
a
sense
.
<EOS>
if
it
fail
to
produce
equal
exertion
,
it
could
not
be
an
equal
conviction
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
the
difference
of
situation
and
habit
!
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
try
to
understand
what
an
amiable
young
man
may
be
likely
to
feel
in
directly
oppose
those
,
whom
as
child
and
boy
he
have
be
look
up
to
all
his
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Our
amiable
young
man
be
a
very
weak
young
man
,
if
this
be
the
first
occasion
of
his
carrying
through
a
resolution
to
do
right
against
the
will
of
other
.
<EOS>
It
ought
to
have
be
a
habit
with
him
by
this
time
,
of
follow
his
duty
,
instead
of
consult
expediency
.
<EOS>
I
can
allow
for
the
fear
of
the
child
,
but
not
of
the
man
.
<EOS>
as
he
become
rational
,
he
ought
to
have
rouse
himself
and
shake
off
all
that
be
unworthy
in
their
authority
.
<EOS>
He
ought
to
have
oppose
the
first
attempt
on
their
side
to
make
him
slight
his
father
.
<EOS>
have
he
begin
as
he
ought
,
there
would
have
be
no
difficulty
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
never
agree
about
him
,
"
cry
Emma
;
"
but
that
be
nothing
extraordinary
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
least
idea
of
his
be
a
weak
young
man
:
I
feel
sure
that
he
be
not
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
would
not
be
blind
to
folly
,
though
in
his
own
son
;
but
he
be
very
likely
to
have
a
more
yielding
,
comply
,
mild
disposition
than
would
suit
your
notion
of
man
's
perfection
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
have
;
and
though
it
may
cut
him
off
from
some
advantage
,
it
will
secure
him
many
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
all
the
advantage
of
sit
still
when
he
ought
to
move
,
and
of
lead
a
life
of
mere
idle
pleasure
,
and
fancy
himself
extremely
expert
in
find
excuse
for
it
.
<EOS>
He
can
sit
down
and
write
a
fine
flourishing
letter
,
full
of
profession
and
falsehood
,
and
persuade
himself
that
he
have
hit
upon
the
very
good
method
in
the
world
of
preserve
peace
at
home
and
prevent
his
father
be
have
any
right
to
complain
.
<EOS>
His
letter
disgust
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
feeling
be
singular
.
<EOS>
They
seem
to
satisfy
every
body
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suspect
they
do
not
satisfy
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
They
hardly
can
satisfy
a
woman
of
her
good
sense
and
quick
feeling
:
stand
in
a
mother
's
place
,
but
without
a
mother
's
affection
to
blind
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
on
her
account
that
attention
to
randall
be
doubly
due
,
and
she
must
doubly
feel
the
omission
.
<EOS>
have
she
be
a
person
of
consequence
herself
,
he
would
have
come
I
dare
say
;
and
it
would
not
have
signify
whether
he
do
or
no
.
<EOS>
Can
you
think
your
friend
behindhand
in
these
sort
of
consideration
?
<EOS>
do
you
suppose
she
do
not
often
say
all
this
to
herself
?
<EOS>
no
,
Emma
,
your
amiable
young
man
can
be
amiable
only
in
French
,
not
in
English
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
very
"
amiable
,
"
have
very
good
manner
,
and
be
very
agreeable
;
but
he
can
have
no
english
delicacy
towards
the
feeling
of
other
people
:
nothing
really
amiable
about
him
.
<EOS>

rather
displeased

should
be
as
ready
to
acknowledge
his
merit
as
any
other
man

I
hear
of
none
,
except
what
be
merely
personal
;
that
he

well

grow

good

look

with

plausible
manner

well

if

nothing

We
do
not
often

well
-
breed

agreeable

We
must
not

nice

ask
for
all

into
the
bargain

can
not
you
imagine
,
Mr.
Knightley

what
a

coming

produce

<EOS>
there
will
be

one
subject
throughout
the
parish
of
Donwell
and
Highbury

but
one
interest
 
one
object
of
curiosity
;
it
will
be
all
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
;
we
shall
think
and
speak
of
nobody
else

so
much
over

power

if
I
find
him
conversable

be
glad

coxcomb

he
will
not

much
of
my

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

My
idea
of
him
be
,
that
he
can
adapt
his
conversation
to
the
taste
of
every
body
,
and
have
the
power
as
well
as
the
wish
of
be
universally
agreeable

<EOS>
to
you
,
he
will
talk
of
farming
;
to
me
,
of
drawing
or
music
;
and
so
on
to
every
body

have
that
general
information
on
all
subject
which
will
enable
him
to
follow
the
lead
,
or
take
the
lead
,
just
as
propriety
may
require
,
and
to
speak
extremely
well
on
each
;
that
be
my
idea
of
him

mine

Mr.

warmly

be

that
if

only

the
favour
to

a
piece
too

"
  
<EOS>
the
mention
of
the
Coles

sure
to
be
follow
by
that
of
Mr.

<EOS>
there
be
intimacy
between

and
Mr.
Cole
have
hear
from
Mr.
Elton
since
his

<EOS>
Emma
know
what
be
come
;
they
must
have
the
letter
over
again
,
and
settle
how
long
he
have
be
go
,
and
how
much
he
be
engage
in
company
,
and
what
a
favourite
<EOS>
he
be
wherever
he
go
,
and
how
full
the
Master
of

Ceremonies

and
she
go
through
it
very
well
,
with
all
the
interest
and
all
the
commendation
that
could
be
requisite
,
and
always
put
forward
to
prevent
Harriet

be
oblige
to
say
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
this
she
have
be
prepare
for
when
she
enter
the
house
;
but
mean
,
have
once
talk
him
handsomely
over
,
to
be
no
farther
incommode
by
any
troublesome
topic
,
and
to
wander
at
large
amongst
all
the
Mistresses
and
Misses
of
Highbury
,
and
their
card
-
party
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
be
prepare
to
have
Jane
Fairfax
succeed
Mr.
Elton
;
but
he
be
actually
hurry
off
by
Miss
Bates
,
she
jump
away
from
him
at
last
abruptly
to
the
Coles
,
to
usher
in
a
letter
from
her
niece
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
,
I
understand
 
certainly
as
to
dance
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cole
be
tell
me
that
dance
at
the
room
at
Bath
be
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cole
be
so
kind
as
to
sit
some
time
with
us
,
talk
of
Jane
;
for
as
soon
as
she
come
in
,
she
begin
inquire
after
her
,
Jane
be
so
very
great
a
favourite
there
.
<EOS>
whenever
she
be
with
us
,
Mrs.
Cole
do
not
know
how
to
shew
her
kindness
enough
;
and
I
must
say
that
Jane
deserve
it
as
much
as
any
body
can
.
<EOS>
and
so
she
begin
inquire
after
her
directly
,
say
,
"
I
know
you
can
not
have
hear
from
Jane
lately
,
because
it
be
not
her
time
for
writing
;
"
<EOS>
and
when
I
immediately
say
,
"
but
indeed
we
have
,
we
have
a
letter
this
very
morning
,
"
I
do
not
know
that
I
ever
see
any
body
more
surprized
.
"
<EOS>
have
you
,
upon
your
honour
?
"
say
she
;
"
well
,
that
be
quite
unexpected
.
<EOS>
do
let
me
hear
what
she
say
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
Emma
's
politeness
be
at
hand
directly
,
to
say
,
with
smile
interest
    
<EOS>
"
have
you
hear
from
Miss
Fairfax
so
lately
?
<EOS>
I
be
extremely
happy
.
<EOS>
I
hope
she
be
well
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
.
<EOS>
You
be
so
kind
!
<EOS>
"
reply
the
happily
deceive
aunt
,
while
eagerly
hunt
for
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
here
it
be
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
it
could
not
be
far
off
;
but
I
have
put
my
huswife
upon
it
,
you
see
,
without
be
aware
,
and
so
it
be
quite
hide
,
<EOS>
but
I
have
it
in
my
hand
so
very
lately
that
I
be
almost
sure
it
must
be
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
I
be
read
it
to
Mrs.
Cole
,
and
since
she
go
away
,
I
be
read
it
again
to
my
mother
,
<EOS>
for
it
be
such
a
pleasure
to
her
 
a
letter
from
Jane
 
that
she
can
never
hear
it
often
enough
;
so
I
know
it
could
not
be
far
off
,
and
here
it
be
,
only
just
under
my
huswife
 
and
since
you
be
so
kind
as
to
wish
to
hear
what
she
say
;
 
but
,
first
of
all
,
I
really
must
,
in
justice
to
Jane
,
apologise
for
her
writing
so
short
a
letter
 
<EOS>
only
two
page
you
see
 
hardly
two
 
<EOS>
and
in
general
she
fill
the
whole
paper
and
cross
half
.
<EOS>
My
mother
often
wonder
that
I
can
make
it
out
so
well
.
<EOS>
She
often
say
,
when
the
letter
be
first
open
,
"
well
,
Hetty
,
now
I
think
you
will
be
put
to
it
to
make
out
all
that
checker
-
work
"
 
do
not
you
,
madam
?
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
tell
her
,
I
be
sure
she
would
contrive
to
make
it
out
herself
,
if
she
have
nobody
to
do
it
for
her
 
<EOS>
every
word
of
it
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
she
would
pore
over
it
till
she
have
make
out
every
word
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
though
my
mother
's
eye
be
not
so
good
as
they
be
,
she
can
see
amazingly
well
still
,
thank
God
!
<EOS>
with
the
help
of
spectacle
.
<EOS>
It
be
such
a
blessing
!
<EOS>
My
mother
's
be
really
very
good
indeed
.
<EOS>
Jane
often
say
,
when
she
be
here
,
"
I
be
sure
,
grandmama
,
you
must
have
have
very
strong
eye
to
see
as
you
do
 
and
so
much
fine
work
as
you
have
do
too
!
 
<EOS>
I
only
wish
my
eye
may
last
me
as
well
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
all
this
speak
extremely
fast
oblige
Miss
Bates
to
stop
for
breath
;
and
Emma
say
something
very
civil
about
the
excellence
of
Miss
Fairfax
's
handwriting
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
extremely
kind
,
"
reply
Miss
Bates
,
highly
gratified
;
"
you
who
be
such
a
judge
,
and
write
so
beautifully
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
there
be
nobody
's
praise
that
could
give
us
so
much
pleasure
as
Miss
Woodhouse
's
.
<EOS>
My
mother
do
not
hear
;
she
be
a
little
deaf
you
know
.
<EOS>
madam
,
"
address
her
<EOS>
,
"
do
you
hear
what
Miss
Woodhouse
be
so
obliging
to
say
about
Jane
's
handwriting
?
"
  
<EOS>
and
Emma
have
the
advantage
of
hear
her
own
silly
compliment
repeat
twice
over
before
the
good
old
lady
could
comprehend
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
ponder
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
upon
the
possibility
,
without
seem
very
rude
,
of
make
her
escape
from
Jane
Fairfax
's
letter
,
and
have
almost
resolve
on
hurry
away
directly
under
some
slight
excuse
,
when
Miss
Bates
turn
to
her
again
and
seize
her
attention
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
mother
's
deafness
be
very
trifling
<EOS>
you
see
 
just
nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
by
only
raise
my
voice
,
and
say
any
thing
two
or
three
time
over
,
she
be
sure
to
hear
;
but
then
she
be
use
to
my
voice
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
very
remarkable
that
she
should
always
hear
Jane
better
than
she
do
me
.
<EOS>
Jane
speak
so
distinct
!
<EOS>
however
,
she
will
not
find
her
grandmama
at
all
deafer
than
she
be
two
year
ago
;
which
be
say
a
great
deal
at
my
mother
's
time
of
life
 
and
it
really
be
full
two
year
,
you
know
,
since
she
be
here
.
<EOS>
We
never
be
so
long
without
see
her
before
,
and
as
I
be
tell
Mrs.
Cole
,
we
shall
hardly
know
how
to
make
enough
of
her
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
be
you
expect
Miss
Fairfax
here
soon
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
;
next
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
that
must
be
a
very
great
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
.
<EOS>
You
be
very
kind
.
<EOS>
yes
,
next
week
.
<EOS>
every
body
be
so
surprized
;
and
every
body
say
the
same
obliging
thing
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
she
will
be
as
happy
to
see
her
friend
at
Highbury
,
as
they
can
be
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
yes
,
Friday
or
Saturday
;
she
can
not
say
which
,
because
Colonel
Campbell
will
be
want
the
carriage
himself
one
of
those
day
.
<EOS>
so
very
good
of
them
to
send
her
the
whole
way
!
<EOS>
but
they
always
do
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
oh
yes
,
Friday
or
Saturday
next
.
<EOS>
that
be
what
she
write
about
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
reason
of
her
write
out
of
rule
,
as
we
call
it
;
for
,
in
the
common
course
,
we
should
not
have
hear
from
her
before
next
Tuesday
or
Wednesday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
so
I
imagine
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
there
could
be
little
chance
of
my
hearing
any
thing
of
Miss
Fairfax
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
so
obliging
of
you
!
<EOS>
no
,
we
should
not
have
hear
,
if
it
have
not
be
for
this
particular
circumstance
,
of
her
be
to
come
here
so
soon
.
<EOS>
My
mother
be
so
delighted
!
 
<EOS>
for
she
be
to
be
three
month
with
us
at
least
.
<EOS>
three
month
,
she
say
so
,
positively
,
as
I
be
go
to
have
the
pleasure
of
read
to
you
.
<EOS>
the
case
be
,
you
see
,
that
the
campbell
be
go
to
Ireland
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dixon
have
persuade
her
father
and
mother
to
come
over
and
see
her
directly
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
intend
to
go
over
till
the
summer
,
but
she
be
so
impatient
to
see
them
again
 
for
till
she
marry
,
last
October
,
she
be
never
away
from
them
so
much
as
a
week
,
which
must
make
it
very
strange
to
be
in
different
kingdom
,
I
be
go
to
say
,
but
however
different
country
,
and
so
she
write
a
very
urgent
letter
to
her
mother
 
or
her
father
<EOS>
,
I
declare
I
do
not
know
which
it
be
,
but
we
shall
see
presently
in
Jane
's
letter
 
write
in
Mr.
Dixon
's
name
as
well
as
her
own
,
to
press
their
come
over
directly
,
and
they
would
give
them
the
meeting
in
Dublin
,
and
take
them
back
to
their
country
seat
,
Baly
-
craig
,
a
beautiful
place
,
I
fancy
.
<EOS>
Jane
have
hear
a
great
deal
of
its
beauty
;
from
Mr.
Dixon
,
I
mean
 
I
do
not
know
that
she
ever
hear
about
it
from
any
body
else
;
but
it
be
very
natural
,
you
know
,
that
he
should
like
to
speak
of
his
own
place
while
he
be
pay
his
address
 
and
as
Jane
use
to
be
very
often
walk
out
with
them
 
for
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
be
very
particular
about
their
daughter
's
not
walk
out
often
with
only
Mr.
Dixon
,
<EOS>
for
which
I
do
not
at
all
blame
them
;
of
course
she
hear
every
thing
he
may
be
tell
Miss
Campbell
about
his
own
home
in
Ireland
;
and
I
think
she
write
us
word
that
he
have
shew
them
some
drawing
of
the
place
,
view
that
he
have
take
himself
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
most
amiable
,
charming
young
man
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
Jane
be
quite
longing
to
go
to
Ireland
,
from
his
account
of
thing
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
this
moment
,
an
ingenious
and
animate
suspicion
enter
Emma
's
brain
with
regard
to
Jane
Fairfax
,
this
charming
Mr.
Dixon
,
and
the
not
go
to
Ireland
,
she
say
,
with
the
insidious
design
of
farth
discovery
,
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
feel
it
very
fortunate
that
Miss
Fairfax
should
be
allow
to
come
to
you
at
such
a
time
.
<EOS>
consider
the
very
particular
friendship
between
her
and
Mrs.
Dixon
,
you
could
hardly
have
expect
her
to
be
excuse
from
accompany
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
very
true
,
very
true
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
the
very
thing
that
we
have
always
be
rather
afraid
of
;
for
we
should
not
have
like
to
have
her
at
such
a
distance
from
us
,
for
month
together
 
not
able
to
come
if
any
thing
be
to
happen
.
<EOS>
but
you
see
,
every
thing
turn
out
for
the
good
.
<EOS>
They
want
her
(
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Dixon
)
excessively
to
come
over
with
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
;
quite
depend
upon
it
;
nothing
can
be
more
kind
or
pressing
than
their
_
joint
_
invitation
,
Jane
say
,
as
you
will
hear
presently
;
Mr.
Dixon
do
not
seem
in
the
least
backward
in
any
attention
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
most
charming
young
man
.
<EOS>
ever
since
the
service
he
render
Jane
at
Weymouth
,
when
they
be
out
in
that
party
on
the
water
,
and
she
,
by
the
sudden
whirling
round
of
something
or
other
among
the
sail
,
would
have
be
dash
into
the
sea
at
once
,
and
actually
be
all
but
go
,
if
he
have
not
,
with
the
great
presence
of
mind
,
catch
hold
of
her
habit
  
<EOS>
(
I
can
never
think
of
it
without
tremble
!
)
 
<EOS>
but
ever
since
we
have
the
history
of
that
day
,
I
have
be
so
fond
of
Mr.
Dixon
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
in
spite
of
all
her
friend
'
urgency
,
and
her
own
wish
of
see
Ireland
,
Miss
Fairfax
prefer
devote
the
time
to
you
and
Mrs.
Bates
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
 
entirely
her
own
doing
,
entirely
her
own
choice
;
and
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
think
she
do
quite
right
,
just
what
they
should
recommend
;
and
indeed
they
particularly
_
wish
_
her
to
try
her
native
air
,
as
she
have
not
be
quite
so
well
as
usual
lately
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
concerned
to
hear
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
they
judge
wisely
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Dixon
must
be
very
much
disappoint
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dixon
,
I
understand
,
have
no
remarkable
degree
of
personal
beauty
;
be
not
,
by
any
mean
,
to
be
compare
with
Miss
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
You
be
very
obliging
to
say
such
thing
 
but
certainly
not
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
comparison
between
them
.
<EOS>
Miss
Campbell
always
be
absolutely
plain
 
but
extremely
elegant
and
amiable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
that
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
catch
a
bad
cold
,
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
so
long
ago
as
the
7th
of
November
,
(
as
I
be
go
to
read
to
you
,
)
and
have
never
be
well
since
.
<EOS>
a
long
time
,
be
not
it
,
for
a
cold
to
hang
upon
her
?
<EOS>
She
never
mention
it
before
,
because
she
would
not
alarm
us
.
<EOS>
just
like
her
!
<EOS>
so
considerate
!
 
<EOS>
but
however
,
she
be
so
far
from
well
,
that
her
kind
friend
<EOS>
the
Campbells
think
she
have
better
come
home
,
and
try
an
air
that
always
agree
with
her
;
and
they
have
no
doubt
that
three
or
four
month
at
Highbury
will
entirely
cure
her
 
and
it
be
certainly
a
great
deal
better
that
she
should
come
here
,
than
go
to
Ireland
,
if
she
be
unwell
.
<EOS>
nobody
could
nurse
her
,
as
we
should
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
appear
to
me
the
most
desirable
arrangement
in
the
world
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
she
be
to
come
to
us
next
Friday
or
Saturday
,
and
the
Campbells
leave
town
in
their
way
to
Holyhead
the
Monday
follow
 
as
you
will
find
from
Jane
's
letter
.
<EOS>
so
sudden
!
 
<EOS>
You
may
guess
,
dear
Miss
Woodhouse
,
what
a
flurry
<EOS>
it
have
throw
me
in
!
<EOS>
if
it
be
not
for
the
drawback
of
her
illness
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
afraid
we
must
expect
to
see
her
grow
thin
,
and
look
very
poorly
.
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
what
an
unlucky
thing
happen
to
me
,
as
to
that
.
<EOS>
I
always
make
a
point
of
read
Jane
's
letter
through
to
myself
first
,
before
I
read
them
aloud
to
my
mother
,
you
know
,
for
fear
of
there
be
any
thing
in
them
to
distress
her
.
<EOS>
Jane
desire
me
to
do
it
,
so
I
always
do
:
<EOS>
and
so
I
begin
to
-
day
with
my
usual
caution
;
but
no
sooner
do
I
come
to
the
mention
of
her
be
unwell
,
than
I
burst
out
,
quite
frightened
,
with
"
bless
me
!
<EOS>
poor
Jane
be
ill
!
"
 
<EOS>
which
my
mother
,
be
on
the
watch
,
hear
distinctly
,
and
be
sadly
alarm
at
.
<EOS>
however
,
when
I
read
on
,
I
find
it
be
not
near
so
bad
as
I
have
fancy
at
first
;
and
I
make
so
light
of
it
now
to
her
,
that
she
do
not
think
much
about
it
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
imagine
how
I
could
be
so
off
my
guard
.
<EOS>
if
Jane
do
not
get
well
soon
,
we
will
call
in
Mr.
Perry
.
<EOS>
the
expense
shall
not
be
think
of
;
and
though
he
be
so
liberal
,
and
so
fond
of
Jane
that
I
dare
say
he
would
not
mean
to
charge
any
thing
for
attendance
,
we
could
not
suffer
it
to
be
so
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
wife
and
family
to
maintain
,
and
be
not
to
be
give
away
his
time
.
<EOS>
well
,
now
I
have
just
give
you
a
hint
of
what
Jane
write
about
,
we
will
turn
to
her
letter
,
and
I
be
sure
she
tell
her
own
story
a
great
deal
better
than
I
can
tell
it
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
we
must
be
run
away
,
"
say
Emma
,
glance
at
Harriet
,
and
begin
to
rise
 
<EOS>
"
My
father
will
be
expect
us
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
intention
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
have
no
power
of
stay
more
than
five
minute
,
when
I
first
enter
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
merely
call
,
because
I
would
not
pass
the
door
without
inquire
after
Mrs.
Bates
;
but
I
have
be
so
pleasantly
detain
!
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
we
must
wish
you
and
Mrs.
Bates
good
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
not
all
that
could
be
urge
to
detain
her
succeed
.
<EOS>
She
regain
the
street
 
happy
in
this
,
that
though
much
have
be
force
on
her
against
her
will
,
though
she
have
in
fact
hear
the
whole
substance
of
Jane
Fairfax
's
letter
,
she
have
be
able
to
escape
the
letter
itself
.
    
<EOS>
Jane
Fairfax
be
an
orphan
,
the
only
child
of
Mrs.
Bates
's
young
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
the
marriage
of
Lieut
.
<EOS>
Fairfax
of
the
regiment
of
infantry
,
and
Miss
Jane
Bates
,
have
have
its
day
of
fame
and
pleasure
,
hope
and
interest
;
but
nothing
now
remain
of
it
,
save
the
melancholy
remembrance
of
him
die
in
action
abroad
 
of
his
widow
sink
under
consumption
and
grief
soon
afterwards
 
and
this
girl
.
  
<EOS>
by
birth
she
belong
to
Highbury
:
and
when
at
three
year
old
,
on
lose
her
mother
,
she
become
the
property
,
the
charge
,
the
consolation
,
the
fondling
of
her
grandmother
and
aunt
,
there
have
seem
every
probability
of
her
be
permanently
fix
there
;
of
her
be
teach
only
what
very
limited
mean
could
command
,
and
grow
up
with
no
advantage
of
connexion
or
improvement
,
to
be
engraft
on
what
nature
have
give
her
in
a
pleasing
person
,
good
understanding
,
and
warm
-
hearted
,
well
-
mean
relation
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
compassionate
feeling
of
a
friend
of
her
father
give
a
change
to
her
destiny
.
<EOS>
this
be
Colonel
Campbell
,
who
have
very
highly
regard
Fairfax
,
as
an
excellent
officer
and
most
deserve
young
man
;
and
farther
,
have
be
indebte
to
him
for
such
attention
,
during
a
severe
camp
-
fever
,
as
he
believe
have
save
his
life
.
<EOS>
these
be
claim
which
he
do
not
learn
to
overlook
,
though
some
year
pass
away
from
the
death
of
poor
Fairfax
,
before
his
own
return
to
England
put
any
thing
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
when
he
do
return
,
he
seek
out
the
child
and
take
notice
of
her
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
married
man
,
with
only
one
live
child
,
a
girl
,
about
Jane
's
age
:
and
Jane
become
their
guest
,
pay
them
long
visit
and
grow
a
favourite
with
all
;
and
before
she
be
nine
year
old
,
his
daughter
's
great
fondness
for
her
,
and
his
own
wish
of
be
a
real
friend
,
unite
to
produce
an
offer
from
Colonel
Campbell
of
undertake
the
whole
charge
of
her
education
.
<EOS>
It
be
accept
;
and
from
that
period
Jane
have
belong
to
Colonel
Campbell
's
family
,
and
have
live
with
them
entirely
,
only
visit
her
grandmother
from
time
to
time
.
  
<EOS>
the
plan
be
that
she
should
be
bring
up
for
educate
other
;
the
very
few
hundred
pound
which
she
inherit
from
her
father
make
independence
impossible
.
<EOS>
to
provide
for
her
otherwise
be
out
of
Colonel
Campbell
's
power
;
for
though
his
income
,
by
pay
and
appointment
,
be
handsome
,
his
fortune
be
moderate
and
must
be
all
his
daughter
's
;
but
,
by
give
her
an
education
,
he
hope
to
be
supply
the
mean
of
respectable
subsistence
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
Jane
Fairfax
's
history
.
<EOS>
She
have
fall
into
good
hand
,
know
nothing
but
kindness
from
the
Campbells
,
and
be
give
an
excellent
education
.
<EOS>
live
constantly
with
right
-
minded
and
well
-
inform
people
,
her
heart
and
understanding
have
receive
every
advantage
of
discipline
and
culture
;
and
Colonel
Campbell
's
residence
be
in
London
,
every
light
talent
have
be
do
full
justice
to
,
by
the
attendance
of
first
-
rate
master
.
<EOS>
Her
disposition
and
ability
be
equally
worthy
of
all
that
friendship
could
do
;
and
at
eighteen
or
nineteen
she
be
,
as
far
as
such
an
early
age
can
be
qualify
for
the
care
of
child
,
fully
competent
to
the
office
of
instruction
herself
;
but
she
be
too
much
beloved
to
be
part
with
.
<EOS>
neither
father
nor
mother
could
promote
,
and
the
daughter
could
not
endure
it
.
<EOS>
the
evil
day
be
put
off
.
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
decide
that
she
be
still
too
young
;
and
Jane
remain
with
them
,
share
,
as
another
daughter
,
in
all
the
rational
pleasure
of
an
elegant
society
,
and
a
judicious
mixture
of
home
and
amusement
,
with
only
the
drawback
of
the
future
,
the
sobering
suggestion
of
her
own
good
understanding
to
remind
her
that
all
this
may
soon
be
over
.
  
<EOS>
the
affection
of
the
whole
family
,
the
warm
attachment
of
Miss
Campbell
in
particular
,
be
the
more
honourable
to
each
party
from
the
circumstance
of
Jane
's
decide
superiority
both
in
beauty
and
acquirement
.
<EOS>
that
nature
have
give
it
in
feature
could
not
be
unseen
by
the
young
woman
,
nor
could
her
high
power
of
mind
be
unfelt
by
the
parent
.
<EOS>
They
continue
together
with
unabated
regard
however
,
till
the
marriage
of
Miss
Campbell
,
who
by
that
chance
,
that
luck
which
so
often
defy
anticipation
in
matrimonial
affair
,
give
attraction
to
what
be
moderate
rather
than
to
what
be
superior
,
engage
the
affection
of
Mr.
Dixon
,
a
young
man
,
rich
and
agreeable
,
almost
as
soon
as
they
be
acquaint
;
and
be
eligibly
and
happily
settle
,
while
Jane
Fairfax
have
yet
her
bread
to
earn
.
  
<EOS>
this
event
have
very
lately
take
place
;
too
lately
for
any
thing
to
be
yet
attempt
by
her
less
fortunate
friend
towards
enter
on
her
path
of
duty
;
though
she
have
now
reach
the
age
which
her
own
judgment
have
fix
on
for
beginning
.
<EOS>
She
have
long
resolve
that
one
-
and
-
twenty
should
be
the
period
.
<EOS>
with
the
fortitude
of
a
devoted
novitiate
,
she
have
resolve
at
one
-
and
-
twenty
to
complete
the
sacrifice
,
and
retire
from
all
the
pleasure
of
life
,
of
rational
intercourse
,
equal
society
,
peace
and
hope
,
to
penance
and
mortification
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
the
good
sense
of
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
could
not
oppose
such
a
resolution
,
though
their
feeling
do
.
<EOS>
as
long
as
they
live
,
no
exertion
would
be
necessary
,
their
home
may
be
her
for
ever
;
and
for
their
own
comfort
they
would
have
retain
her
wholly
;
but
this
would
be
selfishness
:
 
what
must
be
at
last
,
have
well
be
soon
.
<EOS>
perhaps
they
begin
to
feel
it
may
have
be
kind
and
wise
to
have
resist
the
temptation
of
any
delay
,
and
spare
her
from
a
taste
of
such
enjoyment
of
ease
and
leisure
as
must
now
be
relinquish
.
<EOS>
still
,
however
,
affection
be
glad
to
catch
at
any
reasonable
excuse
for
not
hurry
on
the
wretched
moment
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
be
quite
well
since
the
time
of
their
daughter
's
marriage
;
and
till
she
should
have
completely
recover
her
usual
strength
,
they
must
forbid
her
engage
in
duty
,
which
,
so
far
from
be
compatible
with
a
weakened
frame
and
varying
spirit
,
seem
,
under
the
most
favourable
circumstance
,
to
require
something
more
than
human
perfection
of
body
and
mind
to
be
discharge
with
tolerable
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
with
regard
to
her
not
accompany
them
to
Ireland
,
her
account
to
her
aunt
contain
nothing
but
truth
,
though
there
may
be
some
truth
not
tell
.
<EOS>
It
be
her
own
choice
to
give
the
time
of
their
absence
to
Highbury
;
to
spend
,
perhaps
,
her
last
month
of
perfect
liberty
with
those
kind
relation
to
whom
she
be
so
very
dear
:
and
the
Campbells
,
whatever
may
be
their
motive
or
motive
,
whether
single
,
or
double
,
or
treble
,
give
the
arrangement
their
ready
sanction
,
and
say
,
that
they
depend
more
on
a
few
month
spend
in
her
native
air
,
for
the
recovery
of
her
health
,
than
on
any
thing
else
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
that
she
be
to
come
;
and
that
Highbury
,
instead
of
welcome
that
perfect
novelty
which
have
be
so
long
promise
it
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
 
must
put
up
for
the
present
with
Jane
Fairfax
,
who
could
bring
only
the
freshness
of
a
two
year
'
absence
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
be
sorry
;
 
to
have
to
pay
civility
to
a
person
she
do
not
like
through
three
long
month
!
 
<EOS>
to
be
always
do
more
than
she
wish
,
and
less
than
she
ought
!
<EOS>
why
she
do
not
like
Jane
Fairfax
may
be
a
difficult
question
to
answer
;
Mr.
Knightley
have
once
tell
her
it
be
because
she
see
in
her
the
really
accomplished
young
woman
,
which
she
want
to
be
think
herself
;
and
though
the
accusation
have
be
eagerly
refute
at
the
time
,
there
be
moment
of
self
-
examination
in
which
her
conscience
could
not
quite
acquit
her
.
<EOS>
but
"
she
could
never
get
acquaint
with
her
:
she
do
not
know
how
it
be
,
but
there
be
such
coldness
and
reserve
 
such
apparent
indifference
whether
she
please
or
not
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
her
aunt
be
such
an
eternal
talker
!
 
<EOS>
and
she
be
make
such
a
fuss
with
by
every
body
!
 
<EOS>
and
it
have
be
always
imagine
that
they
be
to
be
so
intimate
 
<EOS>
because
their
age
be
the
same
,
every
body
have
suppose
they
must
be
so
fond
of
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
these
be
her
reason
 
she
have
no
well
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
dislike
so
little
just
 
<EOS>
every
imputed
fault
be
so
magnify
by
fancy
,
that
she
never
see
Jane
Fairfax
the
first
time
after
any
considerable
absence
,
without
feel
that
she
have
injure
her
;
and
now
,
when
the
due
visit
be
pay
,
on
her
arrival
,
after
a
two
year
'
interval
,
she
be
particularly
strike
with
the
very
appearance
and
manner
,
which
for
those
two
whole
year
she
have
be
depreciate
.
<EOS>
Jane
Fairfax
be
very
elegant
,
remarkably
elegant
;
and
she
have
herself
the
high
value
for
elegance
.
<EOS>
Her
height
be
pretty
,
just
such
as
almost
every
body
would
think
tall
,
and
nobody
could
think
very
tall
;
her
figure
particularly
graceful
;
her
size
a
most
become
medium
,
between
fat
and
thin
,
though
a
slight
appearance
of
ill
-
health
seem
to
point
out
the
likeliest
evil
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
Emma
could
not
but
feel
all
this
;
and
then
,
her
face
 
<EOS>
her
feature
 
<EOS>
there
be
more
beauty
in
them
altogether
than
she
have
remember
;
it
be
not
regular
,
but
it
be
very
pleasing
beauty
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
,
a
deep
grey
,
with
dark
eye
-
lash
and
eyebrow
,
have
never
be
deny
their
praise
;
but
the
skin
,
which
she
have
be
use
to
cavil
at
,
as
want
colour
,
have
a
clearness
and
delicacy
which
really
need
no
fuller
bloom
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
style
of
beauty
,
of
which
elegance
be
the
reign
character
,
and
as
such
,
she
must
,
in
honour
,
by
all
her
principle
,
admire
it
:
 
elegance
,
which
,
whether
of
person
or
of
mind
,
she
see
so
little
in
Highbury
.
<EOS>
there
,

distinction

and
merit

<EOS>
in
short
,
she
sit
,
during
the
first
visit
,
look
at
Jane
Fairfax
with
twofold
complacency
;
the
sense
of
pleasure
and
the
sense
of
render
justice
,
and
be
determine
that
she
would
dislike
her
no
longer
.
<EOS>
when
she
take
in
her
history
,
indeed
,
her
situation
,
as
well
as
her
beauty
;
when
she
consider
what
all
this
elegance
be
destine
to
,
what
she
be
go
to
sink
from
,
how
she
be
go
to
live
,
it
seem
impossible
to
feel
any
thing
but
compassion
and
respect
;
especially
,
if
to
every
well
-
know
particular
entitle
her
to
interest
,
be
add
the
highly
probable
circumstance
of
an
attachment
to
Mr.
Dixon
,
which
she
have
so
naturally
start
to
herself
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
,
nothing
could
be
more
pitiable
or
more
honourable
than
the
sacrifice
she
have
resolve
on
.
<EOS>
Emma
be
very
willing
now
to
acquit
her
of
have
seduce
Mr.
Dixon
's
action
from
his
wife
,
or
of
any
thing
mischievous
which
her
imagination
have
suggest
at
first
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
love
,
it
may
be
simple
,
single
,
successless
love
on
her
side
alone
.
<EOS>
She
may
have
be
unconsciously
suck
in
the
sad
poison
,
while
a
sharer
of
his
conversation
with
her
friend
;
and
from
the
good
,
the
pure
of
motive
,
may
now
be
deny
herself
this
visit
to
Ireland
,
and
resolve
to
divide
herself
effectually
from
him
and
his
connexion
by
soon
begin
her
career
of
laborious
duty
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
Emma
leave
her
with
such
softened
,
charitable
feeling
,
as
make
her
look
around
in
walk
home
,
and
lament
that
Highbury
afford
no
young
man
worthy
of
give
her
independence
;
nobody
that
she
could
wish
to
scheme
about
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
charming
feeling
 
but
not
last
.
<EOS>
before
she
have
commit
herself
by
any
public
profession
of
eternal
friendship
for
Jane
Fairfax
,
or
do
more
towards
a
recantation
of
past
prejudice
and
error
,
than
say
to
Mr.
Knightley
,
"
She
certainly
be
handsome
;
she
be
well
than
handsome
!
"
<EOS>
Jane
have
spend
an
evening
at
Hartfield
with
her
grandmother
and
aunt
,
and
every
thing
be
relapse
much
into
its
usual
state
.
<EOS>
former
provocation
reappear
.
<EOS>
the
aunt
be
as
tiresome
as
ever
;
more
tiresome
,
because
anxiety
for
her
health
be
now
add
to
admiration
of
her
power
;
and
they
have
to
listen
to
the
description
of
exactly
how
little
bread
and
butter
she
eat
for
breakfast
,
and
how
small
a
slice
of
mutton
for
dinner
,
as
well
as
to
see
exhibition
of
new
cap
and
new
workbag
for
her
mother
and
herself
;
and
Jane
's
offence
rise
again
.
<EOS>
They
have
music
;
Emma
be
oblige
to
play
;
and
the
thank
and
praise
which
necessarily
follow
appear
to
her
an
affectation
of
candour
,
an
air
of
greatness
,
mean
only
to
shew
off
in
high
style
her
own
very
superior
performance
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
besides
,
which
be
the
bad
of
all
,
so
cold
,
so
cautious
!
<EOS>
there
be
no
get
at
her
real
opinion
.
<EOS>
wrapt
up
in
a
cloak
of
politeness
,
she
seem
determined
to
hazard
nothing
.
<EOS>
She
be
disgustingly
,
be
suspiciously
reserve
.
  
<EOS>
if
any
thing
could
be
more
,
where
all
be
most
,
she
be
more
reserved
on
the
subject
of
Weymouth
and
the
Dixons
than
any
thing
.
<EOS>
She
seem
bent
on
give
no
real
insight
into
Mr.
Dixon
's
character
,
or
her
own
value
for
his
company
,
or
opinion
of
the
suitableness
of
the
match
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
general
approbation
and
smoothness
;
nothing
delineate
or
distinguish
.
<EOS>
It
do
her
no
service
however
.
<EOS>
Her
caution
be
throw
away
.
<EOS>
Emma
see
its
artifice
,
and
return
to
her
first
surmise
.
<EOS>
there
probably
_
be
_
something
more
to
conceal
than
her
own
preference
;
Mr.
Dixon
,
perhaps
,
have
be
very
near
change
one
friend
for
the
other
,
or
be
fix
only
to
Miss
Campbell
,
for
the
sake
of
the
future
twelve
thousand
pound

<EOS>
the
like

on
other
topic

<EOS>
She
and
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
have
be
at
Weymouth
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
It
be
know
that
they
be
a
little
acquainted

but
not
a

of
real

could
Emma
procure
as

at

have
do
have

speak
plain

He

now
we

hartfield
pork
be
not

still

unless

make

We

my

<EOS>
she
say
she
can
not
bear
to

the
poor
old
Vicarage
without
a

<EOS>
this
be
great
news
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
Jane
,
you
have
never
see
Mr.
Elton
!
 
<EOS>
no
wonder
that
you
have
such
a
curiosity
to
see
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jane
's
curiosity
do
not
appear
of
that
absorb
nature
as
wholly
to
occupy
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
 
I
have
never
see
Mr.
Elton
,
"
she
reply
,
start
on
this
appeal
;
"
be
he
 
<EOS>
be
he
a
tall
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
shall
answer
that
question
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
would
say
"
yes
,
"
Mr.
Knightley
"
no
;
"
and
Miss
Bates
and
I
that
he
be
just
the
happy
medium
.
<EOS>
when
you
have
be
here
a
little
longer
,
Miss
Fairfax
,
you
will
understand
that
Mr.
Elton
be
the
standard
of
perfection
in
Highbury
,
both
in
person
and
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
true
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
so
she
will
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
very
good
young
man
 
<EOS>
but
,
my
dear
Jane
,
if
you
remember
,
I
tell
you
yesterday
he
be
precisely
the
height
of
Mr.
Perry
.
<EOS>
Miss
Hawkins
,
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
,
an
excellent
young
woman
.
<EOS>
His
extreme
attention
to
my
mother
 
want
her
to
sit
in
the
vicarage
pew
,
that
she
may
hear
the
well
,
for
my
mother
be
a
little
deaf
,
you
know
 
<EOS>
it
be
not
much
,
but
she
do
not
hear
quite
quick
.
<EOS>
Jane
say
that
Colonel
Campbell
be
a
little
deaf
.
<EOS>
He
fancy
bathing
may
be
good
for
it
 
<EOS>
the
warm
bath
 
<EOS>
but
she
say
it
do
him
no
last
benefit
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Campbell
,
you
know
,
be
quite
our
angel
.
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Dixon
seem
a
very
charming
young
man
,
quite
worthy
of
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
such
a
happiness
when
good
people
get
together
 
<EOS>
and
they
always
do
.
<EOS>
now
,
here
will
be
Mr.
Elton
and
Miss
Hawkins
;
and
there
be
the
Coles
,
such
very
good
people
;
and
the
Perrys
 
I
suppose
there
never
be
a
happy
or
a
well
couple
than
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Perry
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
sir
,
"
turn
to
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
"
I
think
there
be
few
place
with
such
society
as
Highbury
.
<EOS>
I
always
say
,
we
be
quite
bless
in
our
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
sir
,
if
there
be
one
thing
my
mother
love
better
than
another
,
it
be
pork
 
<EOS>
a
roast
loin
of
pork
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
as
to
who
,
or
what
Miss
Hawkins
be
,
or
how
long
he
have
be
acquaint
with
her
,
"
say
Emma
,
"
nothing
I
suppose
can
be
know
.
<EOS>
one
feel
that
it
can
not
be
a
very
long
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
go
only
four
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
nobody
have
any
information
to
give
;
and
,
after
a
few
more
wondering
,
Emma
say
,
  
"
You
be
silent
,
Miss
Fairfax
 
<EOS>
but
I
hope
you
mean
to
take
an
interest
in
this
news

<EOS>
You

who
have

hear
and
see
so
much
of
late
on
these

who
must
have
be
so
deep

business
on
Miss
Campbell

when
I
have
see
Mr.
Elton

Jane

dare
say
I
shall
be
interested

I
believe
it

as
it
be
some
month

a
Miss
Hawkins

<EOS>
well
,
I
have
always
rather
fancied
it
would
be
some
young
lady
hereabout
;
not
that
I
ever
 
Mrs.
Cole
once
whisper
to
me
 
<EOS>
but
I
immediately
say
,
"
no
,
Mr.
Elton
be
a
most
worthy
young
man
 
but
'
 
in
short
,
I
do
not
think
I
be
particularly
quick
at
those
sort
of
discovery

<EOS>
I
do
not
pretend
to
it
.
<EOS>
what
be
before
me

I
see
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
nobody
could
wonder
if
Mr.
Elton
should
have
aspire
 
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse

me
chatter
on
,
so
good

humouredly
.
<EOS>
She
know
I
would
not
offend
for
the
world

<EOS>
how
do
Miss
Smith
do

<EOS>
She
seem
quite
recovered
now

<EOS>
have
you

from
Mrs.
John
Knightley
lately

<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
those
dear
little
child

<EOS>
Jane
,
do
you
know
I
always
fancy
Mr.
Dixon
like
Mr.
John
Knightley
.
<EOS>
I
mean
in
person
 
tall
,
and
with
that
sort
of
look
 
and
not
very
talkative
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
quite
wrong
,
my
dear
aunt
;
there
be
no
likeness
at
all

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
odd
!
<EOS>
but
one
never
do
form
a
just
idea
of
any
body
beforehand

<EOS>
one
take
up
a
notion

run
away

Mr.

you

be
not

handsome

plain

My

you
say
that
Miss

that
you
yourself

oh

as
for
me

my
judgment

worth
nothing

I
have
a
regard

I
always
think
a
person
well

look

I
give
what
I
believe
the
general
opinion
,
when
I
call
him
plain

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear
Jane
,
I
believe
we
must

run
away

the
weather
do
not

be
uneasy

too
obliging

we
really
must
take
leave

be
a
most
agreeable
piece
of
news
indeed

<EOS>
I
shall
just
go
round
by
Mrs.

I
shall
not

three
minute

Jane

you
have
better
go
home

I
would
not

<EOS>
thank
you
,
we
do
indeed

I
shall
not

on
Mrs.

I
really
do
not
think
she
care
for
any
thing

<EOS>
_
boil
_
pork

when
we
dress
the

another
thing

<EOS>
good
morning

"
  
<EOS>
Emma
,
alone
with
her
father
,
have
half
her
attention
want
by
him
while
he
lament
that
young
people
would
be
in
such
a
hurry
to
marry
 
and
to
marry
stranger
too
 
and
the
other
half
she
could
give
to
her
own
view
of
the
subject
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
herself
an
amusing
and
a
very
welcome
piece
of
news
,
as
prove
that
Mr.
Elton
could
not
have
suffer
long
;
but
she
be
sorry
for
Harriet
:
<EOS>
Harriet
must
feel
it
 
and
all
that
she
could
hope
be
,
by
give
the
first
information
herself
,
to
save
her
from
hear
it
abruptly
from
other

<EOS>
It
be
now
about
the
time
that
she
be
likely
to
call
.
<EOS>
if
she
be
to
meet
Miss
Bates
in
her
way
!
 
<EOS>
and
upon
its
beginning
to
rain
,
Emma
be
oblige
to
expect
that
the
weather
would
be
detain
her
at
Mrs.
Goddard
's
,
and
that
the
intelligence
would
undoubtedly
rush
upon
her
without
preparation
.
  
<EOS>
the
shower
be
heavy
,
but
short
;
and
it
have
not
be
over
five
minute
,
when
in
come
Harriet
,
with
just
the
heated
,
agitated
look
which
hurry
thither
with
a
full
heart
be
likely
to
give
;
and
the
"
oh
!
Miss
Woodhouse
,
what
do
you
think
have
happen
!
"
<EOS>
which
instantly
burst
forth
,
have
all
the
evidence
of
correspond
perturbation

<EOS>
as
the
blow
be
give
,
Emma
feel
that
she
could
not
now
shew
great
kindness
than
in
listening
;
and
Harriet
,
unchecked
,
run
eagerly
through
what
she
have
to
tell
.
"
<EOS>
She
have
set
out
from
Mrs.
Goddard
's
<EOS>
half
an
hour
ago
 
she
have
be
afraid
it
would
rain
 
<EOS>
she
have
be
afraid
it
would
pour
down
every
moment
 
<EOS>
but
she
think
she
may
get
to
Hartfield
first
 
<EOS>
she
have
hurry
on
as
fast
as
possible
;
but
then
,
as
she
be
pass
by
the
house
where
a
young
woman
be
make
up
a
gown
for
her
,
she
think
she
would
just
step
in
and
see
how
it
go
on
;
and
though
she
do
not
seem
to
stay
half
a
moment
there
,
soon
after
she
come
out
it
begin
to
rain
,
and
she
do
not
know
what
to
do
;
so
she
run
on
directly
,
as
fast
as
she
could
,
and
take
shelter
at
Ford
's
.
"
 
<EOS>
Ford

the
principal
woollen

shop
united
;
the
shop
first
in
size
and
fashion
in
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
,
there
she
have
set
,
without
an
idea
of
any
thing
in
the
world
,
full
ten
minute
,
<EOS>
perhaps
 
when
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
who
should
come
in
 
to
be
sure
it
be
so
very
odd
!
 
<EOS>
but
they
always
deal
at
Ford
's
 
who
should
come
in
,
but
Elizabeth
Martin
and
her
brother
!
 
<EOS>
Dear
Miss
Woodhouse
!
<EOS>
only
think
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
should
have
faint
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
be
sit
near
the
door
 
<EOS>
Elizabeth
see
me
directly
;
but
he
do
not
;
he
be
busy
with
the
umbrella
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
she
see
me
,
but
she
look
away
directly
,
and
take
no
notice
;
and
they
both
go
to
quite
the
farther
end
of
the
shop
;
and
I
keep
sit
near
the
door
!
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
dear
;
I
be
so
miserable
!
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
must
have
be
as
white
as
my
gown
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
go
away
you
know
,
because
of
the
rain
;
but
I
do
so
wish
myself
anywhere
in
the
world
<EOS>
but
there
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
dear
,
Miss
Woodhouse
 
<EOS>
well
,
at
last
,
I
fancy
,
he
look
round
and
see
me
;
for
instead
of
go
on
with
her
buying
,
they
begin
whisper
to
one
another
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
they
be
talk
of
me
;
and
I
could
not
help
think
that
he
be
persuade
her
to
speak
to
me
 
<EOS>
(
do
you
think
he
be
,
Miss
Woodhouse
?
)
 
<EOS>
for
presently
she
come
forward
 
<EOS>
come
quite
up
to
me
,
and
ask
me
how
I
do
,
and
seem
ready
to
shake
hand
,
if
I
would
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
do
any
of
it
in
the
same
way
that
she
use
;
I
could
see
she
be
alter
;
but
<EOS>
,
however
,
she
seem
to
_
try
_
to
be
very
friendly
,
and
we
shake
hand
,
and
stand
talk
some
time
;
but
I
know
no
more
what
I
say
 
<EOS>
I
be
in
such
a
tremble
!
 
<EOS>
I
remember
she
say
she
be
sorry
we
never
meet
now
;
<EOS>
which
I
think
almost
too
kind
!
<EOS>
dear
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
I
be
absolutely
miserable
!
<EOS>
by
that
time
,
it
be
begin
to
hold
up
,
and
I
be
determined
that
nothing
should
stop
me
from
get
away
 
and
then
 
only
think
!
 
<EOS>
I
find
he
be
come
up
towards
me
too
 
slowly
you
know
,
and
as
if
he
do
not
quite
know
what
to
do
;
and
so
he
come
and
speak
,
and
<EOS>
I
answer
 
and
I
stand
for
a
minute
,
feel
dreadfully
,
you
know
,
one
can
not
tell
how
;
and
then
I
take
courage
,
and
say
it
do
not
rain
,
and
I
must
go
;
and
so
off
I
set
;
and
I
have
not
get
three
yard
from
the
door
,
when
he
come
after
me
,
only
to
say
<EOS>
,
if
I
be
go
to
Hartfield
,
he
think
I
have
much
better
go
round
by
Mr.
Cole
's
stable
,
for
I
should
find
the
near
way
quite
float
by
this
rain
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
dear
,
I
think
it
would
have
be
the
death
of
me
!
<EOS>
so
I
say
,
I
be
very
much
oblige
to
him
:
<EOS>
you
know
I
could
not
do
less
;
and
then
he
go
back
to
Elizabeth
,
and
I
come
round
by
the
stable
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
do
 
<EOS>
but
I
hardly
know
where
I
be
,
or
any
thing
about
it
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
I
would
rather
do
any
thing
than
have
it
happen
:
and
yet
,
you
know
,
there
be
a
sort
of
satisfaction
in
see
him
behave
so
pleasantly
<EOS>
and
so
kindly
.
<EOS>
and
Elizabeth
,
too
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
do
talk
to
me
and
make
me
comfortable
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
very
sincerely
do
Emma
wish
to
do
so
;
but
it
be
not
immediately
in
her
power
.
<EOS>
She
be
oblige
to
stop
and
think
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
thoroughly
comfortable
herself
.
<EOS>
the
young
man
's
conduct
,
and
his
sister
's
,
seem
the
result
of
real
feeling
,
and
she
could
not
but
pity
them
.
<EOS>
as
Harriet
describe
it
,
there
have
be
an
interesting
mixture
of
wound
affection
and
genuine
delicacy
in
their
behaviour
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
believe
them
to
be
well
-
mean
,
worthy
people
before
;
and
what
difference
do
this
make
in
the
evil
of
the
connexion
?
<EOS>
It
be
folly
to
be
disturb
by
it
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
he
must
be
sorry
to
lose
her
 
<EOS>
they
must
be
all
sorry
.
<EOS>
ambition
,
as
well
as
love
,
have
probably
be
mortify
.
<EOS>
They
may
all
have
hope
to
rise
by
Harriet
's
acquaintance
:
and
besides
,
what
be
the
value
of
Harriet
's
description
?
 
<EOS>
so
easily
pleased
 
so
little
discerning
;
 
what
signify
her
praise
?
  
<EOS>
She
exert
herself
,
and
do
try
to
make
her
comfortable
,
by
consider
all
that
have
pass
as
a
mere
trifle
,
and
quite
unworthy
of
be
dwelt
on
,
  
"
It
may
be
distress
,
for
the
moment
,
"
say
she
;
"
but
you
seem
to
have
behave
extremely
well
;
and
it
be
over
 
and
may
never
 
can
never
,
as
a
first
meeting
,
occur
again
,
and
therefore
you
need
not
think
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
say
,
"
very
true
,
"
and
she
"
would
not
think
about
it
;
"
but
still
she
talk
of
it
 
still
she
could
talk
of
nothing
else
;
and
Emma
,
at
last
,
in
order
to
put
the
Martins
out
of
her
head
,
be
oblige
to
hurry
on
the
news
,
which
she
have
mean
to
give
with
so
much
tender
caution
;
hardly
know
herself
whether
to
rejoice
or
be
angry
,
ashamed
or
only
amuse
,
at
such
a
state
of
mind
in
poor
Harriet
 
<EOS>
such
a
conclusion
of
Mr.
Elton
's
importance
with
her
!
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
's
right
,
however
,
gradually
revive
.
<EOS>
though
she
do
not
feel
the
first
intelligence
as
she
may
have
do
the
day
before
,
or
an
hour
before
,
its
interest
soon
increase
;
and
before
their
first
conversation
be
over
,
she
have
talk
herself
into
all
the
sensation
of
curiosity
,
wonder
and
regret
,
pain
and
pleasure
,
as
to
this
fortunate
Miss
Hawkins
,
which
could
conduce
to
place
the
Martins
under
proper
subordination
in
her
fancy
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
learn
to
be
rather
glad
that
there
have
be
such
a
meeting
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
serviceable
in
deaden
the
first
shock
,
without
retain
any
influence
to
alarm
.
<EOS>
as
Harriet
now
live
,
the
Martins
could
not
get
at
her
,
without
seek
her
,
where
hitherto
they
have
want
either
the
courage
or
the
condescension
to
seek
her
;
for
since
her
refusal
of
the
brother
,
the
sister
never
have
be
at
Mrs.
Goddard
's
;
and
a
twelvemonth
may
pass
without
their
be
throw
together
again
,
with
any
necessity
,
or
even
any
power
of
speech
.
    
<EOS>
Human
nature
be
so
well
disposed
towards
those
who
be
in
interesting
situation
,
that
a
young
person
,
who
either
marry
or
die
,
be
sure
of
be
kindly
speak
of
.
  
<EOS>
a
week
have
not
pass
since
Miss
Hawkins
's
name
be
first
mention
in
Highbury
,
before
she
be
,
by
some
mean
or
other
,
discover
to
have
every
recommendation
of
person
and
mind
;
to
be
handsome
,
elegant
,
highly
accomplished
,
and
perfectly
amiable
:
and
when
Mr.
Elton
himself
arrive
to
triumph
in
his
happy
prospect
,
and
circulate
the
fame
of
her
merit
,
there
be
very
little
more
for
him
to
do
,
than
to
tell
her
christian
name
,
and
say
whose
music
she
principally
play
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
return
,
a
very
happy
man
.
<EOS>
He
have
go
away
reject
and
mortify
 
disappoint
in
a
very
sanguine
hope
,
after
a
series
of
what
appear
to
him
strong
encouragement
;
and
not
only
lose
the
right
lady
,
but
find
himself
debase
to
the
level
of
a
very
wrong
one
.
<EOS>
He
have
go
away
deeply
offended
 
<EOS>
he
come
back
engage
to
another
 
and
to
another
as
superior
,
of
course
,
to
the
first
,
as
under
such
circumstance
what
be
gain
always
be
to
what
be
lose
.
<EOS>
He
come
back
gay
and
self
-
satisfied
,
eager
and
busy
,
care
nothing
for
Miss
Woodhouse
,
and
defy
Miss
Smith
.
  
<EOS>
the
charming
Augusta
Hawkins
,
in
addition
to
all
the
usual
advantage
of
perfect
beauty
and
merit
,
be
in
possession
of
an
independent
fortune
,
of
so
many
thousand
as
would
always
be
call
ten
;
a
point
of
some
dignity
,
as
well
as
some
convenience
:
the
story
tell
well
;
he
have
not
throw
himself
away
 
<EOS>
he
have
gain
a
woman
of
10,000
l.
or
thereabout
;
and
he
have
gain
her
with
such
delightful
rapidity
 
the
first
hour
of
introduction
have
be
so
very
soon
follow
by
distinguish
notice
;
the
history
which
he
have
to
give
Mrs.
Cole
of
the
rise
and
progress
of
the
affair
be
so
glorious
 
<EOS>
the
step
so
quick
,
from
the
accidental
rencontre
,
to
the
dinner
at
Mr.
Green
's
,
and
the
party
at
Mrs.
Brown
's
 
smile
and
blush
rise
in
importance
 
with
consciousness
and
agitation
richly
scatter
 
<EOS>
the
lady
have
be
so
easily
impressed
 
<EOS>
so
sweetly
disposed
 
<EOS>
have
in
short
,
to
use
a
most
intelligible
phrase
,
be
so
very
ready
to
have
him
,
<EOS>
that
vanity
and
prudence
be
equally
contented
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
catch
both
substance
and
shadow
 
both
fortune
and
affection
,
and
be
just
the
happy
man
he
ought
to
be
;
talk
only
of
himself
and
his
own
concern
 
expect
to
be
congratulate
 
ready
to
be
laugh
at
 
and
,
with
cordial
,
fearless
smile
,
now
address
all
the
young
lady
of
the
place
,
to
whom
,
a
few
week
ago
,
he
would
have
be
more
cautiously
gallant
.
  
<EOS>
the
wedding
be
no
distant
event
,
as
the
party
have
only
themselves
to
please
,
and
nothing
but
the
necessary
preparation
to
wait
for
;
and
when
he
set
out
for
Bath
again
,
there
be
a
general
expectation
,
which
a
certain
glance
of
Mrs.
Cole
's
do
not
seem
to
contradict
,
that
when
he
next
enter
Highbury
he
would
bring
his
bride
.
  
<EOS>
during
his
present
short
stay
,
Emma
have
barely
see
him
;
but
just
enough
to
feel
that
the
first
meeting
be
over
,
and
to
give
her
the
impression
of
his
not
be
improve
by
the
mixture
of
pique
and
pretension
,
now
spread
over
his
air
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
in
fact
,
begin
very
much
to
wonder
that
she
have
ever
think
him
pleasing
at
all
;
and
his
sight
be
so
inseparably
connect
with
some
very
disagreeable
feeling
,
that
,
except
in
a
moral
light
,
as
a
penance
,
a
lesson
,
a
source
of
profitable
humiliation
to
her
own
mind
,
she
would
have
be
thankful
to
be
assure
of
never
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
She
wish
him
very
well
;
but
he
give
her
pain
,
and
his
welfare
twenty
mile
off
would
administer
most
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
the
pain
of
his
continue
residence
in
Highbury
,
however
,
must
certainly
be
lessen
by
his
marriage
.
<EOS>
many
vain
solicitude
would
be
prevent
 
many
awkwardness
smooth
by
it
.
<EOS>
a
_
Mrs.
_
_
Elton
_
would
be
an
excuse
for
any
change
of
intercourse
;
former
intimacy
may
sink
without
remark
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
almost
begin
their
life
of
civility
again
.
  
<EOS>
of
the
lady
,
individually
,
Emma
think
very
little
.
<EOS>
She
be
good
enough
for
Mr.
Elton
,
no
doubt
;
accomplish
enough
for
Highbury
 
<EOS>
handsome
enough
 
to
look
plain
,
probably
,
by
Harriet
's
side
.
<EOS>
as
to
connexion
,
there
Emma
be
perfectly
easy
;
persuade
,
that
after
all
his
own
vaunted
claim
and
disdain
of
Harriet
,
he
have
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
on
that
article
,
truth
seem
attainable
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
what
_
<EOS>
she
be
,
must
be
uncertain
;
but
_
who
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
she
be
,
may
be
find
out
;
and
set
aside
the
10,000
l.
,
it
do
not
appear
that
she
be
at
all
Harriet
's
superior
.
<EOS>
She
bring
no
name
,
no
blood
,
no
alliance
.
<EOS>
Miss
Hawkins
be
the
young
of
the
two
daughter
of
a
Bristol
 
merchant
,
of
course
,
he
must
be
call
;
but
,
as
the
whole
of
the
profit
of
his
mercantile
life
appear
so
very
moderate
,
it
be
not
unfair
to
guess
the
dignity
of
his
line
of
trade
have
be
very
moderate
also
.
<EOS>
part
of
every
winter
she
have
be
use
to
spend
in
Bath
;
but
Bristol
be
her
home
,
the
very
heart
of
Bristol
;
for
though
the
father
and
mother
have
die
some
year
ago
,
an
uncle
remain
 
in
the
law
line
 
nothing
more
distinctly
honourable
be
hazard
of
him
,
than
that
he
be
in
the
law
line
;
and
with
him
the
daughter
have
live
.
<EOS>
Emma
guess
him
to
be
the
drudge
of
some
attorney
,
and
too
stupid
to
rise
.
<EOS>
and
all
the
grandeur
of
the
connexion
seem
dependent
on
the
eld
sister
,
who
be
_
<EOS>
very
_
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
well
_
_
marry
_
,
to
a
gentleman
in
a
_
great
_
_
way
<EOS>
_
,
near
Bristol
,
who
keep
two
carriage
!
<EOS>
that
be
the
wind
-
up
of
the
history
;
that
be
the
glory
of
Miss
Hawkins
.
  
<EOS>
Could
she
but
have
give
Harriet
her
feeling
about
it
all
!
<EOS>
She
have
talk
her
into
love
;
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
she
be
not
so
easily
to
be
talk
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
charm
of
an
object
to
occupy
the
many
vacancy
of
Harriet
's
mind
be
not
to
be
talk
away
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
supersede
by
another
;
he
certainly
would
indeed
;
nothing
could
be
clear
;
even
a
Robert
Martin
would
have
be
sufficient
;
but
nothing
else
,
she
fear
,
would
cure
her
.
<EOS>
Harriet
be
one
of
those
,
who
,
have
once
begin
,
would
be
always
in
love
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
poor
girl
!
<EOS>
she
be
considerably
bad
from
this
reappearance
of
Mr.
Elton
.
<EOS>
She
be
always
have
a
glimpse
of
him
somewhere
or
other
.
<EOS>
Emma
see
him
only
once
;
but
two
or
three
time
every
day
Harriet
be
sure
<EOS>
_
just
_
<EOS>
to
meet
with
him
,
or
_
just
_
to
miss
him
,
_
just
_
to
hear
his
voice
,
or
see
his
shoulder
,
_
just

to
have
something
occur
to
preserve
him
in
her
fancy
,
in
all
the
favour
warmth
of
surprize
and
conjecture

<EOS>
She
be
,
moreover
,
perpetually
hear
about
him
;
for
,
except
when
at
Hartfield
,
she
be
always
among
those
who
see
no
fault
in
Mr.
Elton
,
and
find
nothing
so
interesting
as
the
discussion
of
his
concern
;
and
every
report

therefore
,
every
guess
 
<EOS>
all
that
have

may
occur
in

Her
regard

invariable
praise

and
her
regret
keep
alive
,
and
feeling
irritate
by
ceaseless
repetition
of
Miss
Hawkins
's
happiness
,
and
continual
observation
of
,
how
much
he
seem
attach
!
 
<EOS>
his
air
as
he
walk
by
the
house
 
<EOS>
the
very
sitting
of
his
hat
,
be
all
in
proof
of
how
much

have
it
be
allowable
entertainment

<EOS>
have
there
be
no
pain
to
her
friend
,
or
reproach
to
herself

in
the
wavering
of
Harriet

Emma

amuse
by
its
variation

<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
's
engagement
have
be
the
cure
of
the
agitation
of
meet
Mr.
Martin
.
<EOS>
the
unhappiness
produce
by
the
knowledge
of
that
engagement
have
be
a
little
put
aside
by
Elizabeth
Martin
's
call
at
Mrs.
Goddard
's
a
few
day
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Harriet
have
not
be
at
home
;
but
a
note
have
be
prepare
and
leave
for
her
,
write
in
the
very
style
to
touch
;
a
small
mixture
of
reproach
,
with
a
great
deal
of
kindness
;
and
till
Mr.
Elton
himself
appear
,
she
have
be
much
occupy
by
it
,
continually
ponder
over
what
could
be
do
in
return
,
and
wish
to
do
more
than
she
dare
to
confess
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Elton
,
in
person
,
have
drive
away
all
such
care
.
<EOS>
while
he
staid
,
the
Martins
be
forget
;
and
on
the
very
morning
of
his
setting
off
for
Bath
again
,
Emma
,
to
dissipate
some
of
the
distress
it
occasion
,
judge
it
best
for
her
to
return
Elizabeth
Martin
's
visit
.
  
<EOS>
how
that
visit
be
to
be
acknowledge
 
what
would
be
necessary
 
and
what
may
be
safe
,
have
be
a
point
of
some
doubtful
consideration
.
<EOS>
absolute
neglect
of
the
mother
and
sister
,
when
invite
to
come
,
would
be
ingratitude
.
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
:
and
yet
the
danger
of
a
renewal
of
the
acquaintance
 
!
  
<EOS>
after
much
thinking
,
she
could
determine
on
nothing
better
,
than
Harriet
's
return
the
visit
;
but
in
a
way
that
,
if
they
have
understanding
,
should
convince
them
that
it
be
to
be
only
a
formal
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
She
mean
to
take
her
in
the
carriage
,
leave
her
at
the
Abbey
Mill
,
while
she
drive
a
little
farther
,
and
call
for
her
again
so
soon
,
as
to
allow
no
time
for
insidious
application
or
dangerous
recurrence
to
the
past
,
and
give
the
most
decide
proof
of
what
degree
of
intimacy
be
choose
for
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
She
could
think
of
nothing
well
:
and
though
there
be
something
in
it
which
her
own
heart
could
not
approve
 
something
of
ingratitude
,
merely
gloss
over
 
it
must
be
do
,
or
what
would
become
of
Harriet
?
    
<EOS>
small
heart
have
Harriet
for
visit
.
<EOS>
only
half
an
hour
before
her
friend
call
for
her
at
Mrs.
Goddard
's
,
her
evil
star
have
lead
her
to
the
very
spot
where
,
at
that
moment
,
a
trunk
,
direct
to
_
the
Rev.
Philip
Elton
,
White
-
Hart
,
Bath
_
,
be
to
be
see
under
the
operation
of
be
lift
into
the
butcher
's
cart
,
which
be
to
convey
it
to
where
the
coach
past
;
and
every
thing
in
this
world
,
except
that
trunk
and
the
direction
,
be
consequently
a
blank
.
  
<EOS>
She
go
,
however
;
and
when
they
reach
the
farm
,
and
she
be
to
be
put
down
,
at
the
end
of
the
broad
,
neat
gravel
walk
,
which
lead
between
espali
apple
-
tree
to
the
front
door
,
the
sight
of
every
thing
which
have
give
her
so
much
pleasure
the
autumn
before
,
be
begin
to
revive
a
little
local
agitation
;
and
when
they
part
,
Emma
observe
her
to
be
look
around
with
a
sort
of
fearful
curiosity
,
which
determine
her
not
to
allow
the
visit
to
exceed
the
propose
quarter
of
an
hour
.
<EOS>
She
go
on
herself
,
to
give
that
portion
of
time
to
an
old
servant
who
be
marry
,
and
settle
in
Donwell
.
  
<EOS>
the
quarter
of
an
hour
bring
her
punctually
to
the
white
gate
again
;
and
Miss
Smith
receive
her
summon
,
be
with
her
without
delay
,
and
unattende
by
any
alarming
young
man
.
<EOS>
She
come
solitarily
down
the
gravel
walk
 
<EOS>
a
Miss
Martin
just
appear
at
the
door
,
and
part
with
her
seemingly
with
ceremonious
civility
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
could
not
very
soon
give
an
intelligible
account
.
<EOS>
She
be
feel
too
much
;
but
at
last
Emma
collect
from
her
enough
to
understand
the
sort
of
meeting
,
and
the
sort
of
pain
it
be
create
.
<EOS>
She
have
see
only
Mrs.
Martin
and
the
two
girl
.
<EOS>
They
have
receive
her
doubtingly
,
if
not
coolly
;
and
nothing
beyond
the
mere
commonplace
have
be
talk
almost
all
the
time
 
till
just
at
last
,
when
Mrs.
Martin
's
saying
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
that
she
think
Miss
Smith
be
grow
,
have
bring
on
a
more
interesting
subject
,
and
a
warm
manner
.
<EOS>
in
that
very
room
she
have
be
measure
last
September
,
with
her
two
friend
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
pencil
mark
and
memorandum
on
the
wainscot
by
the
window
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
have
do
it
.
<EOS>
They
all
seem
to
remember
the
day
,
the
hour
,
the
party
,
the
occasion
 
to
feel
the
same
consciousness
,
the
same
regret
 
to
be
ready
to
return
to
the
same
good
understanding
;
and
they
be
just
grow
again
like
themselves
,
(
Harriet
,
as
Emma
must
suspect
,
as
ready
as
the
good
of
them
to
be
cordial
and
happy
,
)
when
the
carriage
reappear
,
and
all
be
over
.
<EOS>
the
style
of
the
visit
,
and
the
shortness
of
it
,
be
then
feel
to
be
decisive
.
<EOS>
fourteen
minute
to
be
give
to
those
with
whom
she
have
thankfully
pass
six
week
not
six
month
ago
!
 
<EOS>
Emma
could
not
but
picture
it
all
,
and
feel
how
justly
they
may
resent
,
how
naturally
Harriet
must
suffer
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
bad
business
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
give
a
great
deal
,
or
endure
a
great
deal
,
to
have
have
the
Martins
in
a
high
rank
of
life
.
<EOS>
They
be
so
deserving
,
that
a
_
little
_
high
should
have
be
enough
:
but
as
it
be
,
how
could
she
have
do
otherwise
?
 
<EOS>
impossible
!
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
repent
.
<EOS>
They
must
be
separate
;
but
there
be
a
great
deal
of
pain
in
the
process
 
so
much
to
herself
at
this
time
,
that
she
soon
feel
the
necessity
of
a
little
consolation
,
and
resolve
on
go
home
by
way
of
randall
to
procure
it
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
be
quite
sick
of
Mr.
Elton
and
the
Martins
.
<EOS>
the
refreshment
of
randall
be
absolutely
necessary
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
good
scheme
;
but
on
drive
to
the
door
they
hear
that
neither
"
master
nor
mistress
be
at
home
;
"
they
have
both
be
out
some
time
;
the
man
believe
they
be
go
to
Hartfield
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
too
bad
,
"
cry
Emma
,
as
they
turn
away
.
"
<EOS>
and
now
we
shall
just
miss
them
;
too
provoking
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
when
I
have
be
so
disappointed
.
"
<EOS>
and
she
lean
back
in
the
corner
,
to
indulge
her
murmur
,
or
to
reason
them
away
;
<EOS>
probably
a
little
of
both
 
such
be
the
common
process
of
a
not
ill
-
dispose
mind
.
<EOS>
presently
the
carriage
stopt
;
she
look
up
;
it
be
stopt
by
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
,
who
be
stand
to
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
instant
pleasure
in
the
sight
of
them
,
and
still
great
pleasure
be
convey
in
sound
 
for
Mr.
Weston
immediately
accost
her
with
,
  
<EOS>
"
how

We

a
certainty
 
<EOS>
he

at
Oxford

for
a
whole
fortnight

I
know
it
would
be
so

<EOS>
if
he
have
come
at
Christmas
he
could
not

staid
three
day

I
be
always
glad

just
the
right
weather
for
him

fine

<EOS>
We
shall
enjoy
him
completely
;
every
thing

out
exactly
as
we

wish

"
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
resist
such
news
,
no
possibility
of
avoid
the
influence
of
such
a
happy
face
as
Mr.
Weston
's
,
confirm
as
it
all
be
by
the
word
and
the
countenance
of
his
wife
,
few
and
quieter
,
but
not
less
to
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
to
know
that
_
she
_
think
his
come
certain
be
enough
to
make
Emma
consider
it
so
,
and
sincerely
do
she
rejoice
in
their
joy
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
most
delightful
reanimation
of
exhausted
spirit
.
<EOS>
the
wear
-
out
past
be
sink
in
the
freshness
of
what
be
come
;
and
in
the
rapidity
of
half
a
moment
's
thought
,
she
hope
Mr.
Elton
would
now
be
talk
of
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
give
her
the
history
of
the
engagement
at
Enscombe
,
which
allow
his
son
to
answer
for
have
an
entire
fortnight
at
his
command
,
as
well
as
the
route
and
the
method
of
his
journey
;
and
she
listen
,
and
smile
,
and
congratulate
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
soon
bring
him
over
to
Hartfield
,
"
say
he
,
at
the
conclusion
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
could
imagine
she
see
a
touch
of
the
arm
at
this
speech
,
from
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
well

Mr.

"
we

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well

well

I
be
ready

and
turn
again
to
Emma

"
but
you
must
not

fine
young

my

Emma
could
look
perfectly

Mr.

quick
amendment

so
end
a
most
satisfactory
meeting

<EOS>
Emma
's
spirit
be
mount
quite
up
to
happiness
;
every
thing
wear
a
different
air
;
James
and
his
horse
seem
not
half
so
sluggish
as
before

<EOS>
when

look
at

hedge

she

the

come
out
;
and
when
she
turn
round
to

she
see
something

look

spring

a
tender
smile

there

"
Will
Mr.

much

but
neither
geography
nor
tranquillity
could
come
all
at

and
Emma
be
now
in
a
humour
to
resolve
that
they
should
both
come
in
time

the
morning

Mrs.

at

eleven

twelve

that

there

a
well

a
readiness

complacency
.
<EOS>
Emma
be
directly
sure
that
he
know
how
to
make
himself
agreeable
;
the
conviction
be
strengthen
by
what
follow
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
much
pleased
with
randall
,
think
it
a
most
admirably
arrange
house
,
would
hardly
allow
it
even
to
be
very
small
,
admire
the
situation
,
the
walk
to
Highbury
,
Highbury
itself
,
Hartfield
still
more
,
and
profess
himself
to
have
always
feel
the
sort
of
interest
in
the
country
which
none
but
one
's
_
own
_
country
give
,
and
the
great
curiosity
to
visit
it
.
<EOS>
that
he
should
never
have
be
able
to
indulge
so
amiable
a
feeling
before
,
pass
suspiciously
through
Emma
's
brain
;
but
still
,
if
it
be
a
falsehood
,
it
be
a
pleasant
one
,
and
pleasantly
handle
.
<EOS>
His
manner
have
no
air
of
study
or
exaggeration
.
<EOS>
He
do
really
look
and
speak
as
if
in
a
state
of
no
common
enjoyment
.
  
<EOS>
Their
subject
in
general
be
such
as
belong
to
an
opening
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
on
his
side
be
the
inquiry
,
 
"
be
she
a
horsewoman
?
 
<EOS>
pleasant
ride
?
 
<EOS>
Pleasant
walk
?
 
<EOS>
have
they
a
large
neighbourhood
?
 
<EOS>
Highbury
,
perhaps
,
afford
society
enough
?
 
<EOS>
there
be
several
very
pretty
house
in
and
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
ball
 
have
they
ball
?
 
<EOS>
be
it
a
musical
society
?
"
  
<EOS>
but
when
satisfied
on
all
these
point
,
and
their
acquaintance
proportionably
advance
,
he
contrive
to
find
an
opportunity
,
while
their
two
father
be
engage
with
each
other
,
of
introduce
his
mother
-
in
-
law
,
and
speak
of
her
with
so
much
handsome
praise
,
so
much
warm
admiration
,
so
much
gratitude
for
the
happiness
she
secure
to
his
father
,
and
her
very
kind
reception
of
himself
,
as
be
an
additional
proof
of
his
know
how
to
please
 
and
of
his
certainly
think
it
worth
while
to
try
to
please
her
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
advance
a
word
of
praise
beyond
what
she
know
to
be
thoroughly
deserve
by
Mrs.
Weston
;
but
,
undoubtedly
he
could
know
very
little
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
He
understand
what
would
be
welcome
;
he
could
be
sure
of
little
else
.
"
<EOS>
His
father
's
marriage
,
"
he
say
,
"
have
be
the
wise
measure
,
every
friend
must
rejoice
in
it
;
and
the
family
from
whom
he
have
receive
such
a
blessing
must
be
ever
consider
as
have
confer
the
high
obligation
on
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
get
as
near
as
he
could
to
thanking
her
for
Miss
Taylor
's
merit
,
without
seem
quite
to
forget
that
in
the
common
course
of
thing
it
be
to
be
rather
suppose
that
Miss
Taylor
have
form
Miss
Woodhouse
's
character
,
than
Miss
Woodhouse
Miss
Taylor
's
.
<EOS>
and
at
last
,
as
if
resolve
to
qualify
his
opinion
completely
for
travel
round
to
its
object
,
he
wind
it
all
up
with
astonishment
at
the
youth
and
beauty
of
her
person
.
  
<EOS>
"
elegant
,
agreeable
manner
,
I
be
prepare
for
,
"
say
he
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
confess
that
,
consider
every
thing
,
I
have
not
expect
more
than
a
very
tolerably
well
-
look
woman
of
a
certain
age
;
I
do
not
know
that
I
be
to
find
a
pretty
young
woman
in
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
can
not
see
too
much
perfection
in
Mrs.
Weston
for
my
feeling
,
"
say
Emma
;
"
be
you
to
guess
her
to
be
_
eighteen
<EOS>
_
,
I
should
listen
with
pleasure
;
but
_
she
_
would
be
ready
to
quarrel
with
you
for
use
such
word
.
<EOS>
do
not
let
her
imagine
that
you
have
speak
of
her
as
a
pretty
young
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
should
know
better
,
"
he
reply
;
"
no
,
depend
upon
it
,
(
with
a
gallant
bow
,
)
<EOS>
that
in
address
Mrs.
Weston
<EOS>
I
should
understand
whom
I
may
praise
without
any
danger
of
be
think
extravagant
in
my
term
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
wonder
whether
the
same
suspicion
of
what
may
be
expect
from
their
know
each
other
,
which
have
take
strong
possession
of
her
mind
,
have
ever
cross
his
;
and
whether
his
compliment
be
to
be
consider
as
mark
of
acquiescence
,
or
proof
of
defiance
.
<EOS>
She
must
see
more
of
him
to
understand
his
way
;
at
present
she
only
feel
they
be
agreeable
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
no
doubt
of
what
Mr.
Weston
be
often
think
about
.
<EOS>
His
quick
eye
she
detect
again
and
again
glance
towards
them
with
a
happy
expression
;
and
even
,
when
he
may
have
determine
not
to
look
,
she
be
confident
that
he
be
often
listen
.
  
<EOS>
Her
own
father
's
perfect
exemption
from
any
thought
of
the
kind
,
the
entire
deficiency
in
him
of
all
such
sort
of
penetration
or
suspicion
,
be
a
most
comfortable
circumstance
.
<EOS>
happily
he
be
not
farth
from
approve
matrimony
than
from
foresee
it
.
 
<EOS>
though
always
object
to
every
marriage
that
be
arrange
,
he
never
suffer
beforehand
from
the
apprehension
of
any
;
it
seem
as
if
he
could
not
think
so
ill
of
any
two
person
'
understanding
as
to
suppose
they
mean
to
marry
till
it
be
prove
against
them
.
<EOS>
She
bless
the
favouring
blindness
.
<EOS>
He
could
now
,
without
the
drawback
of
a
single
unpleasant
surmise
,
without
a
glance
forward
at
any
possible
treachery
in
his
guest
,
give
way
to
all
his
natural
kind
-
hearted
civility
in
solicitous
inquiry
after
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
's
accommodation
on
his
journey
,
through
the
sad
evil
of
sleep
two
night
on

express
very
genuine
unmixed
anxiety
to
know
that
he
have
certainly
escape
catch
cold
 
<EOS>
which
,
however
,
he
could
not
allow
him
to
feel
quite
assured
of
himself
till
after
another
night

<EOS>
a
reasonable
visit
pay

Mr.

He

He

business
at
the

about
his
hay

and
a
great

errand
for
Mrs.

<EOS>
His

too
well
breed

hear
the
hint

rise
immediately
also

say
,
  
"
as
you
be

farther

sir

I
will
take
the
opportunity
of

a
visit

must

pay
some
day

other

therefore
may

<EOS>
I
have
the
honour
of
be
acquaint
with
a
neighbour
of
yours

(
turn
to
Emma

a
lady
reside
in
or
near
Highbury
;
a
family
of
the
name
of
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
no
difficulty
,
I
suppose
,
in
find
the
house
;
though
Fairfax
,
I
believe
,
be
not
the
proper
name
 
<EOS>
I
should
rather
say
Barnes
,
or
Bates
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
any
family
of
that
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
to
be
sure
we
do
,

cry
his
father
;
"
Mrs.
Bates
 
<EOS>
we
pass
her
house
 
<EOS>
I
see
Miss
Bates
at
the
window
.
<EOS>
true
,
true
,
you
be
acquaint
with
Miss
Fairfax
;
I
remember
you
know
her
at
Weymouth
,
and
a
fine
girl
she
be
.
<EOS>
call
upon
her
,
by
all
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
necessity
for
my
calling
this
morning
,
"
say
the
young
man
;
"
another
day
would
do
as
well
;
but
there
be
that
degree
of
acquaintance
at
Weymouth
which
 
"
  
"
oh
!
go
to
-
day
,
go
to
-
day

<EOS>
do
not
defer
it

<EOS>
what
be
right
to
be
do
can
not
be
do
too
soon
.
<EOS>
and
,
besides
,
I
must
give
you
a
hint
,
Frank
;
any
want
of
attention
to
her
_
here
<EOS>
_
should
be
carefully
avoid
.
<EOS>
You
see
her
with
the
Campbells
,
when
she
be
the
equal
of
every
body
she
mix
with
,
but
here
she
be
with
a
poor
old
grandmother
,
who
have
barely
enough
to
live
on
.
<EOS>
if
you
do
not
call
early
it
will
be
a
slight
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
son
look
convinced
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
her
speak
of
the
acquaintance
,
"
say
Emma
;
"
she
be
a
very
elegant
young
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
agree
to
it
,
but
with
so
quiet
<EOS>
a
"
yes
,
"
as
incline
her
almost
to
doubt
his
real
concurrence
;
and
yet
there
must
be
a
very
distinct
sort
of
elegance
for
the
fashionable
world
,
if
Jane
Fairfax
could
be
think
only
ordinarily
gifted
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
be
never
particularly
strike
by
her
manner
before
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
think
you
will
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
You
will
see
her
to
advantage
;
see
her
and
hear
her
 
<EOS>
no
,
I
be
afraid
you
will
not
hear
her
at
all
,
for
she
have
an
aunt
who
never
hold
her
tongue
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
acquaint
with
Miss
Jane
Fairfax
,
sir
,
be
you
?
"
say
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
always
the
last
to
make
his
way
in
conversation
;
"
then
give
me
leave
to
assure
you
that
you
will
find
her
a
very
agreeable
young
lady
.
<EOS>
She
be
stay
here
on
a
visit
to
her
grandmama
and
aunt
,
very
worthy
people
;
I
have
know
them
all
my
life
.
<EOS>
They
will
be
extremely
glad
to
see
you
,
I
be
sure
;
and
one
of
my
servant
shall
go
with
you
to
shew
you
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
sir
,
upon
no
account
in
the
world
;
my
father
can
direct
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
your
father
be
not

so
far
;
he
be
only
go
to
the
Crown
,
quite
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
,

there
be
a
great
many
house
;
you
may
be
very
much
at
a
loss
,
and
it
be
a
very
dirty
walk
,
unless
you
keep
on
the
footpath
;

my
coachman
can
tell
you
where
you
have
best
cross
the
street

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
still
decline
it
,
look
as
serious
as
he
could
,
and
his
father
give
his
hearty
support
by
call
out
,
"
My
good
friend
,
this
be
quite
unnecessary
;
Frank
know
a
puddle
of
water
when
he
see
it
,
and
as
to
Mrs.
Bates
's
,
he
may
get
there
from
the
Crown
in
a
hop
,
step
,
and
jump
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
be
permit
to
go
alone
;
and
with
a
cordial
nod
from
one
,
and
a
graceful
bow
from
the
other
,
the
two
gentleman
take
leave
.
<EOS>
Emma
remain
very
well
pleased
with
this
beginning
of
the
acquaintance
,
and
could
now
engage
to
think
of
them
all
at
randall
any
hour
of
the
day
,
with
full
confidence
in
their
comfort
.
    
<EOS>
the
next
morning
bring
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
again
.
<EOS>
He
come
with
Mrs.
Weston
,
to
whom
and
to
Highbury
he
seem
to
take
very
cordially
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
sit
with
her
,
it
appear
,
most
companionably
at
home
,
till
her
usual
hour
of
exercise
;
and
on
be
desire
to
chuse
their
walk
,
immediately
fix
on
Highbury
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
do
not
doubt
there
be
very
pleasant
walk
in
every
direction
,
but
if
leave
to
him
,
he
should
always
chuse
the
same
.
<EOS>
Highbury
,
that
airy
,
cheerful
,
happy
-
look
Highbury
,
would
be
his
constant
attraction
.
"
 
<EOS>
Highbury
,
with
Mrs.
Weston
,
stand
for
Hartfield
;
and
she
trust
to
its
bearing
the
same
construction
with
him
.
<EOS>
They
walk
thither
directly
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
have
hardly
expect
them
:
for
Mr.
Weston
,
who
have
call
in
for
half
a
minute
,
in
order
to
hear
that
his
son
be
very
handsome
,
know
nothing
of
their
plan
;
and
it
be
an
agreeable
surprize
to
her
,
therefore
,
to
perceive
them
walk
up
to
the
house
together
,
arm
in
arm
.
<EOS>
She
be
want
to
see
him
again
,
and
especially
to
see
him
in
company
with
Mrs.
Weston
,
upon
his
behaviour
to
whom
her
opinion
of
him
be
to
depend
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
deficient
there
,
nothing
should
make
amend
for
it
.
<EOS>
but
on
see
them
together
,
she
become
perfectly
satisfied
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
merely
in
fine
word
or
hyperbolical
compliment
that
he
pay
his
duty
;
nothing
could
be
more
proper
or
pleasing
than
his
whole
manner
to
her
 
nothing
could
more
agreeably
denote
his
wish
of
consider
her
as
a
friend
and
secure
her
affection
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
time
enough
for
Emma
to
form
a
reasonable
judgment
,
as
their
visit
include
all
the
rest
of
the
morning
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
three
walk
about
together
for
an
hour
or
two
 
first
round
the
shrubbery
of
Hartfield
,
and
afterwards
in
Highbury
.
<EOS>
He
be
delighted
with
every
thing
;
admire
Hartfield
sufficiently
for
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
ear
;
and
when
their
go
farther
be
resolve
on
,
confess
his
wish
to
be
make
acquainted
with
the
whole
village
,
and
find
matter
of
commendation
and
interest
much
oftener
than
Emma
could
have
suppose
.
  
<EOS>
some
of
the
object
of
his
curiosity
speak
very
amiable
feeling
.
<EOS>
He
beg
to
be
shew
the
house
which
his
father
have
live
in
so
long
,
and
which
have
be
the
home
of
his
father
's
father
;
and
on
recollect
that
an
old
woman
who
have
nurse
him
be
still
live
,
walk
in
quest
of
her
cottage
from
one
end
of
the
street
to
the
other
;
and
though
in
some
point
of
pursuit
or
observation
there
be
no
positive
merit
<EOS>
,
they
shew
,
altogether
,
a
good
-
will
towards
Highbury
in
general
,
which
must
be
very
like
a
merit
to
those
he
be
with
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
watch
and
decide
,
that
with
such
feeling
as
be
now
shew
,
it
could
not
be
fairly
suppose
that
he
have
be
ever
voluntarily
absent
himself
;
that
he
have
not
be
act
a
part
,
or
make
a
parade
of
insincere
profession
;
and
that
Mr.
Knightley
certainly
have
not
do
him
justice
.
  
<EOS>
Their
first
pause
be
at
the
Crown
Inn
,
an
inconsiderable
house
,
though
the
principal
one
of
the
sort
,
where
a
couple
of
pair
of
post
-
horse
be
keep
,
more
for
the
convenience
of
the
neighbourhood
than
from
any
run
on
the
road
;
and
his
companion
have
not
expect
to
be
detain
by
any
interest
excite
there
;
but
in
pass
it
they
give
the
history
of
the
large
room
visibly
add
;
it
have
be
build
many
year
ago
for
a
ball
-
room
,
and
while
the
neighbourhood
have
be
in
a
particularly
populous
,
dance
state
,
have
be
occasionally
use
as
such
;
 
but
such
brilliant
day
have
long
pass
away
,
and
now
the
high
purpose
for
which
it
be
ever
want
be
to
accommodate
a
whist
club
establish
among
the
gentleman
and
half
-
gentleman
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
He
be
immediately
interested
.
<EOS>
Its
character
as
a
ball
-
room
catch
him
;
and
instead
of
pass
on
,
he
stopt
for
several
minute
at
the
two
superior
sashed
window
which
be
open
,
to
look
in
and
contemplate
its
capability
,
and
lament
that
its
original
purpose
should
have
cease
.
<EOS>
He
see
no
fault
in
the
room
,
he
would
acknowledge
none
which
they
suggest
.
<EOS>
no
,
it
be
long
enough
,
broad
enough
,
handsome
enough
.
<EOS>
It
would
hold
the
very
number
for
comfort
.
<EOS>
They
ought
to
have
ball
there
at
least
every
fortnight
through
the
winter
.
<EOS>
why
have
not
Miss
Woodhouse
revive
the
former
good
old
day
of
the
room
?
 
<EOS>
She
who
could
do
any
thing
in
Highbury
!
<EOS>
the
want
of
proper
family
in
the
place
,
and
the
conviction
that
none
beyond
the
place
and
its
immediate
environ
could
be
tempt
to
attend
,
be
mention
;
but
he
be
not
satisfied
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
persuade
that
so
many
good
-
look
house
as
he
see
around
him
,
could
not
furnish
number
enough
for
such
a
meeting
;
and
even
when
particular
be
give
and
family
describe
,
he
be
still
unwilling
to
admit
that
the
inconvenience
of
such
a
mixture
would
be
any
thing
,
or
that
there
would
be
the
small
difficulty
in
every
body
's
return
into
their
proper
place
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
He
argue
like
a
young
man
very
much
bent
on
dancing
;
and
Emma
be
rather
surprize
to
see
the
constitution
of
the
Weston
prevail
so
decidedly
against
the
habit
of
the
Churchills
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
have
all
the
life
and
spirit
,
cheerful
feeling
,
and
social
inclination
of
his
father
,
and
nothing
of
the
pride
or
reserve
of
Enscombe
.
<EOS>
of
pride
,
indeed
,
there
be
,
perhaps
,
scarcely
enough
;
his
indifference
to
a
confusion
of
rank
,
border
too
much
on
inelegance
of
mind
.
<EOS>
He
could
be
no
judge
,
however
,
of
the
evil
he
be
hold
cheap
.
<EOS>
It
be
but
an
effusion
of
lively
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
he
be
persuade
to
move
on
from
the
front
of
the
crown
;
and
be
now
almost
face
the
house
where
the
Bateses
lodge
,
Emma
recollect
his
intend
visit
the
day
before
,
and
ask
him
if
he
have
pay
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
"
 
<EOS>
he
reply
;
"
I
be
just
go
to
mention
it
.
<EOS>
a
very
successful
visit
:
 
<EOS>
I
see
all
the
three
lady
;
and
feel
very
much
oblige
to
you
for
your
preparatory
hint
.
<EOS>
if
the
talk
aunt
have
take
me
quite
by
surprize
,
it
must
have
be
the
death
of
me
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
I
be
only
betray
into
pay
a
most
unreasonable
visit
.
<EOS>
ten
minute
would
have
be
all
that
be
necessary
,
perhaps
all
that
be
proper
;
and
I
have
tell
my
father
I
should
certainly
be
at
home
before
him
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
get
away
,
no
pause
;
and
,
to
my
utter
astonishment
,
I
find
,
when
he
(
find
me
nowhere
else
)
join
me
there
at
last
,
that
I
have
be
actually
sit
with
them
very
nearly
three
-
quarter
of
an
hour
.
<EOS>
the
good
lady
have
not
give
me
the
possibility
of
escape
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
how
do
you
think
Miss
Fairfax
look
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ill
,
very
ill
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
if
a
young
lady
can
ever
be
allow
to
look
ill
.
<EOS>
but
the
expression
be
hardly
admissible
,
Mrs.
Weston
,
be
it
?
<EOS>
lady
can
never
look
ill
.
<EOS>
and
,
seriously
,
Miss
Fairfax
be
naturally
so
pale
,
as
almost
always
to
give
the
appearance
of
ill
health
.
 
<EOS>
a
most
deplorable
want
of
complexion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
would
not
agree
to
this
,
and
begin
a
warm
defence
of
Miss
Fairfax
's
complexion
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
certainly
never
brilliant
,
but
she
would
not
allow
it
to
have
a
sickly
hue
in
general
;
and
there
be
a
softness
and
delicacy
in
her
skin
which
give
peculiar
elegance
to
the
character
of
her
face
.
"
<EOS>
He
listen
with
all
due
deference
;
acknowledge
that
he
have
hear
many
people
say
the
same
 
<EOS>
but
yet
he
must
confess
,
that
to
him
nothing
could
make
amend
for
the
want
of
the
fine
glow
of
health
.
<EOS>
where
feature
be
indifferent
,
a
fine
complexion
give
beauty
to
them
all
;
and
where
they
be
good
,
the
effect
be
 
fortunately
<EOS>
he
nee
not
attempt
to
describe
what
the
effect
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Emma
,
"
there
be
no
dispute
about
taste
.
 
<EOS>
at
least
you
admire
her
except
her
complexion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
shake
his
head
and
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
separate
Miss
Fairfax
and
her
complexion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
see
her
often
at
Weymouth
?
<EOS>
be
you
often
in
the
same
society
?
"
  
<EOS>
at
this
moment
they
be
approach
Ford
's
,
and
he
hastily
exclaim
,
"
ha
!
<EOS>
this
must
be
the
very
shop
that
every
body
attend
every
day
of
their
life
,
as
my
father
inform
me
.
<EOS>
He
come
to
Highbury
himself
,
he
say
,
six
day
out
of
the
seven
,
and
have
always
business
at
Ford
's
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
not
inconvenient
to
you
,
pray
let
us
go
in
,
that
I
may
prove
myself
to
belong
to
the
place
,
to
be
a
true
citizen
of
Highbury
.
<EOS>
I
must
buy
something
at
Ford
's
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
take
out
my
freedom
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
they
sell
glove
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
glove
and
every
thing
.
<EOS>
I
do
admire
your
patriotism
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
adore
in
Highbury
.
<EOS>
You
be
very
popular
before
you
come
,
because
you
be
Mr.
Weston
's
son
 
but
lie
out
half
a
guinea
at
Ford
's
,
and
your
popularity
will
stand
upon
your
own
virtue
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
go
in
;
and
while
the
sleek
,
well
-
tie
parcel
of
"
Men
's
beaver
"
and
"
York
Tan
"
be
bring
down
and
display
on
the
counter
,
he
say
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Miss
Woodhouse
<EOS>
,
you
be
speak
to
me
,
you
be
say
something
at
the
very
moment
of
this
burst
of
my
_
amor
<EOS>
_
_
patriae
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
do
not
let
me
lose
it
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
the
utmost
stretch
of
public
fame
would
not
make
me
amend
for
the
loss
of
any
happiness
in
private
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
merely
ask
,
whether
you
have
know
much
of
Miss
Fairfax
and
her
party
at
Weymouth
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
that
I
understand
your
question
,
I
must
pronounce
it
to
be
a
very
unfair
one
.
<EOS>
It
be
always
the
lady
's
right
to
decide
on
the
degree
of
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairfax
must
already
have
give
her
account
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
not
commit
myself
by
claim
more
than
she
may
chuse
to
allow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
!
<EOS>
you
answer
as
discreetly
as
she
could
do
herself
.
<EOS>
but
her
account
of
every
thing
leave
so
much
to
be
guess
,
she
be
so
very
reserved
,
so
very
unwilling
to
give
the
least
information
about
any
body
,
that
I
really
think
you
may
say
what
you
like
of
your
acquaintance
with
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
,
indeed
?
 
<EOS>
then
I
will
speak
the
truth
,
and
nothing
suit
me
so
well
.
<EOS>
I
meet
her
frequently
at
Weymouth
.
<EOS>
I
have
know
the
Campbells
a
little
in
town
;
and
at
Weymouth
we
be
very
much
in
the
same
set
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Campbell
be
a
very
agreeable
man
,
and
Mrs.
Campbell
a
friendly
,
warm
-
hearted
woman
.
<EOS>
I
like
them
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
Miss
Fairfax
's
situation
in
life
,
I
conclude
;
what
she
be
destine
to
be
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
 
(
rather
hesitatingly
)
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
get
upon
delicate
subject
,
Emma
,
"
say
Mrs.
Weston
smile
;
"
remember
that
I
be
here
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
hardly
know
what
to
say
when
you
speak
of
Miss
Fairfax
's
situation
in
life
.
<EOS>
I
will
move
a
little
farther
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
do
forget
to
think
of
_
her
_
,
"
say
Emma
,
"
as
have
ever
be
any
thing
but
my
friend
and
my
dear
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
look
as
if
he
fully
understand
and
honour
such
a
sentiment
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
glove
be
buy
,
and
they
have
quit
the
shop
again
,
"
do
you
ever
hear
the
young
lady
we
be
speak
of
,
play
?
"
say
Frank
Churchill
.
  
<EOS>
"
ever
hear
her
!
"
<EOS>
repeat
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
You
forget
how
much
she
belong
to
Highbury
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
her
every
year
of
our
life
since
we
both
begin
.
<EOS>
She
play
charmingly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
so
,
do
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
want
the
opinion
of
some
one
who
could
really
judge
.
<EOS>
She
appear
to
me
to
play
well
,
that
is
,
with
considerable
taste
,
but
I
know
nothing
of
the
matter
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
excessively
fond
of
music
,
but
without
the
small
skill
or
right
of
judging
of
any
body
's
performance
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
use
to
hear
her
's
admire
;
and
I
remember
one
proof
of
her
be
think
to
play
well
:
 
a
man
,
a
very
musical
man
,
and
in
love
with
another
woman
 
engage
to
her
 
on
the
point
of
marriage
 
would
yet
never
ask
that
other
woman
to
sit
down
to
the
instrument
,
if
the
lady
in
question
could
sit
down
instead
 
never
seem
to
like
to
hear
one
if
he
could
hear
the
other
.
<EOS>
that
,
I
think
,
in
a
man
of
know
musical
talent
,
be
some
proof
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
proof
indeed
!
"
say
Emma
,
highly
amuse
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Dixon
be
very
musical
,
be
he
?
<EOS>
We
shall
know
more
about
them
all
,
in
half
an
hour
,
from
you
,
than
Miss
Fairfax
would
have
vouchsafe
in
half
a
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Mr.
Dixon
and
Miss
Campbell
be
the
person
;
and
I
think
it
a
very
strong
proof
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
certainly
 
very
strong
it
be
;
to
own
the
truth
,
a
great
deal
strong
than
,
if
_
I
_
have
be
Miss
Campbell
,
would
have
be
at
all
agreeable
to
me

<EOS>
I
could
not
excuse
a
man
's
have
more
music
than
love
 
more
ear
than
eye
 
a
more
acute
sensibility
to
fine
sound
than
to
my
feeling

<EOS>
how
do
Miss
Campbell
appear
to
like
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
her
very
particular
friend
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
poor
comfort
!
"
say
Emma
,
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
one
would
rather
have
a
stranger
prefer
than
one
be
very
particular
friend
 
with
a
stranger
it
may
not
recur
again
 
but
the
misery
of
have
a
very
particular
friend
always
at
hand

to
do
every
thing
well

do
oneself

Poor
Mrs.

!
<EOS>
well

glad

go
to
settle
in
Ireland

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
right
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
very
flattering
to
Miss
Campbell
;
but
she
really
do
not
seem
to
feel
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
much
the
well

so
much
the
bad

<EOS>
I
do
not

which
.

be
it
sweetness

be
it
stupidity
in
her
 
quickness
of
friendship

dulness
of
feeling
 
<EOS>
there
be
one
person
,
I
think
,
<EOS>
who
must
have
feel
it
:
Miss
Fairfax
herself

<EOS>
She
must
have
feel
the
improper
and
dangerous
distinction
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
to
that
 
I
do
not
 
"
  
"
oh
!
do
not
imagine
that
I

account

else

be
know

no

herself

one
may
guess

there
appear
such
a
perfectly
good
understanding
among
them
all

he
begin
rather
quickly

check
himself

add
,
"
however
<EOS>
,
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
say
on
what
term
they
really
be
 
how
it
may
all
be
behind
the
scene
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
that
there
be
smoothness
outwardly
.
<EOS>
but
you
,
who
have
know
Miss
Fairfax
from
a
child
,
must
be
a
well
judge
of
her
character
,
and
of
how
she
be
likely
to
conduct
herself
in
critical
situation
,
than
I
can
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
know
her
from
a
child
,
undoubtedly
;
we
have
be
child
and
woman
together
;
and
it
be
natural
to
suppose
that
we
should
be
intimate
,
 
that
we
should
have
take
to
each
other
whenever
she
visit
her
friend
.
<EOS>
but
we
never
do
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
how
it
have
happen
;
a
little
,
perhaps
,
from
that
wickedness
on
my
side
which
be
prone
to
take
disgust
towards
a
girl
so
idolized
and
so
cry
up
as
she
always
be
,
by
her
aunt
and
grandmother
,
and
all
their
set
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
her
reserve
 
<EOS>
I
never
could
attach
myself
to
any
one
so
completely
reserve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
most
repulsive
quality
,
indeed
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
oftentime
very
convenient
,
no
doubt
,
but
never
pleasing
.
<EOS>
there
be
safety
in
reserve
,
but
no
attraction
.
<EOS>
one
can
not
love
a
reserved
person
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
till
the
reserve
cease
towards
oneself
;
and
then
the
attraction
may
be
the
great
.
<EOS>
but
I
must
be
more
in
want
of
a
friend
,
or
an
agreeable
companion
,
than
I
have
yet
be
,
to
take
the
trouble
of
conquer
any
body
's
reserve
to
procure
one
.
<EOS>
intimacy
between
Miss
Fairfax
and
me
be
quite
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
reason
to
think
ill
of
her
 
not
the
least
 
except
that
such
extreme
and
perpetual
cautiousness
of
word
and
manner
,
such
a
dread
of
give
a
distinct
idea
about
any
body
,
be
apt
to
suggest
suspicion
of
there
be
something
to
conceal
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
perfectly
agree
with
her
:
and
after
walk
together
so
long
,
and
think
so
much
alike
,
Emma
feel
herself
so
well
acquainted
with
him
,
that
she
could
hardly
believe
it
to
be
only
their
second
meeting
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
exactly
what
she
have
expect
;
less
of
the
man
of
the
world
in
some
of
his
notion
,
less
of
the
spoiled
child
of
fortune
,
therefore
better
than
she
have
expect
.
<EOS>
His
idea
seem
more
moderate
 
his
feeling
warm
.
<EOS>
She
be
particularly
strike
by
his
manner
of
consider
Mr.
Elton
's
house
,
which
,
as
well
as
the
church
,
he
would
go
and
look
at
,
and
would
not
join
them
in
find
much
fault
with
.
<EOS>
no
,
he
could
not
believe
it
a
bad
house
;
not
such
a
house
as
a
man
be
to
be
pity
for
have
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
to
be
share
with
the
woman
he
love
,
he
could
not
think
any
man
to
be
pity
for
have
that
house
.
<EOS>
there
must
be
ample
room
in
it
for
every
real
comfort
.
<EOS>
the
man
must
be
a
blockhead
who
want
more
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
laugh
,
and
say
he
do
not
know
what
he
be
talk
about
.
<EOS>
use
only
to
a
large
house
himself
,
and
without
ever
think
how
many
advantage
and
accommodation
be
attach
to
its
size
,
he
could
be
no
judge
of
the
privation
inevitably
belong
to
a
small
one
.
<EOS>
but
Emma
,
in
her
own
mind
,
determine
that
he
_
do
_
know
what
he
be
talk
about
,
and
that
he
shew
a
very
amiable
inclination
to
settle
early
in
life
,
and
to
marry
,
from
worthy
motive
.
<EOS>
He
may
not
be
aware
of
the
inroad
on
domestic
peace
to
be
occasion
by
no
housekeeper
's
room
,
or
a
bad
butler
's
pantry
,
but
no
doubt
he
do
perfectly
feel
that
Enscombe
could
not
make
him
happy
,
and
that
whenever
he
be
attach
,
he
would
willingly
give
up
much
of
wealth
to
be
allow
an
early
establishment
.
    
<EOS>
Emma
be
very
good
opinion
of
Frank
Churchill
be
a
little
shake
the
following
day
,
by
hear
that
he
be
go
off
to
London
,
merely
to
have
his
hair
cut
.
<EOS>
a
sudden
freak
seem
to
have
seize
him
at
breakfast
,
and
he
have
send
for
a
chaise
and
set
off
,
intend
to
return
to
dinner
,
but
with
no
more
important
view
that
appear
than
have
his
hair
cut
.
<EOS>
there
be
certainly
no
harm
in
his
travel
sixteen
mile
twice
over
on
such
an
errand
;
but
there
be
an
air
of
foppery
and
nonsense
in
it
which
she
could
not
approve
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
accord
with
the
rationality
of
plan
,
the
moderation
in
expense
,
or
even
the
unselfish
warmth
of
heart
,
which
she
have
believe
herself
to
discern
in
him
yesterday
.
<EOS>
vanity
,
extravagance
,
love
of
change
,
restlessness
of
temper
,
which
must
be
do
something
,
good
or
bad
;
heedlessness
as
to
the
pleasure
of
his
father
and
Mrs.
Weston
,
indifferent
as
to
how
his
conduct
may
appear
in
general
;
he
become
liable
to
all
these
charge
.
<EOS>
His
father
only
call
him
a
coxcomb
,
and
think
it
a
very
good
story
;
but
that
Mrs.
Weston
do
not
like
it
,
be
clear
enough
,
by
her
pass
it
over
as
quickly
as
possible
,
and
make
no
other
comment
than
that
"
all
young
people
would
have
their
little
whim
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
the
exception
of
this
little
blot
,
Emma
find
that
his
visit
hitherto
have
give
her
friend
only
good
idea
of
him
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
be
very
ready
to
say
how
attentive
and
pleasant
a
companion
he
make
himself
 
how
much
she
see
to
like
in
his
disposition
altogether
.
<EOS>
He
appear
to
have
a
very
open
temper
 
certainly
a
very
cheerful
and
lively
one
;
she
could
observe
nothing
wrong
in
his
notion
,
a
great
deal
decidedly
right
;
he
speak
of
his
uncle
with
warm
regard
,
be
fond
of
talk
of
him
 
<EOS>
say
he
would
be
the
good
man
in
the
world
if
he
be
leave
to
himself
;
and
though
there
be
no
be
attach
to
the
aunt
,
he
acknowledge
her
kindness
with
gratitude
,
and
seem
to
mean
always
to
speak
of
her
with
respect
.
<EOS>
this
be
all
very
promising
;
and
,
but
for
such
an
unfortunate
fancy
for
have
his
hair
cut
,
there
be
nothing
to
denote
him
unworthy
of
the
distinguished
honour
which
her
imagination
have
give
him
;
the
honour
,
if
not
of
be
really
in
love
with
her
,
of
be
at
least
very
near
it
,
and
save
only
by
her
own
indifference
 
(
for
still
her
resolution
hold
of
never
marry
)
 
<EOS>
the
honour
,
in
short
,
of
be
mark
out
for
her
by
all
their
joint
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
,
on
his
side
,
add
a
virtue
to
the
account
which
must
have
some
weight
.
<EOS>
He
give
her
to
understand
that
Frank
admire
her
extremely
 
think
her
very
beautiful
and
very
charming
;
and
with
so
much
to
be
say
for
him
altogether
,
she
find
she
must
not
judge
him
harshly
.
<EOS>
as
Mrs.
Weston
observe
,
"
all
young
people
would
have
their
little
whim
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
one
person
among
his
new
acquaintance
in
Surry
,
not
so
leniently
disposed
.
<EOS>
in
general
he
be
judge
,
throughout
the
parish
of
Donwell
and
Highbury
,
with
great
candour
;
liberal
allowance
be
make
for
the
little
excess
of
such
a
handsome
young
man
 
one
who
smile
so
often
and
bow
so
well
;
but
there
be
one
spirit
among
them
not
to
be
soften
,
from
its
power
of
censure
,
by
bow
or
smile
 
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
the
circumstance
be
tell
him
at
Hartfield
;
for
the
moment
,
he
be
silent
;
but
Emma
hear
him
almost
immediately
afterwards
say
to
himself
,
over
a
newspaper
he
hold
in
his
hand
,
"
hum
!
<EOS>
just
the
trifling
,
silly
fellow
<EOS>
I
take
him
for
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
have
half
a
mind
to
resent
;
but
an
instant
's
observation
convince
her
that
it
be
really
say
only
to
relieve
his
own
feeling
,
and
not
mean
to
provoke
;
and
therefore
she
let
it
pass
.
  
<EOS>
although
in
one
instance
the
bearer
of
not
good
tiding
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
's
visit
this
morning
be
in
another
respect
particularly
opportune
.
<EOS>
something
occur
while
they
be
at
Hartfield
,
to
make
Emma
want
their
advice
;
and
,
which
be
still
more
lucky
,
she
want
exactly
the
advice
they
give
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
occurrence
:
 
<EOS>
the
Coles
have
be
settle
some
year
in
Highbury
,
and
be
very
good
sort
of
people
 
friendly
,
liberal
,
and
unpretende
;
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
they
be
of
low
origin
,
in
trade
,
and
only
moderately
genteel
.
<EOS>
on
their
first
come
into
the
country
,
they
have
live
in
proportion
to
their
income
,
quietly
,
keep
little
company
,
and
that
little
unexpensively
;
but
the
last
year
or
two
have
bring
them
a
considerable
increase
of
mean
 
<EOS>
the
house
in
town
have
yield
great
profit
,
and
fortune
in
general
have
smile
on
them
.
<EOS>
with
their
wealth
,
their
view
increase
;
their
want
of
a
large
house
,
their
inclination
for
more
company
.
<EOS>
They
add
to
their
house
,
to
their
number
of
servant
,
to
their
expense
of
every
sort
;
and
by
this
time
be
,
in
fortune
and
style
of
living
,
second
only
to
the
family
at
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
Their
love
of
society
,
and
their
new
dining
-
room
,
prepare
every
body
for
their
keep
dinner
-
company
;
and
a
few
party
,
chiefly
among
the
single
man
,
have
already
take
place
.
<EOS>
the
regular
and
good
family
Emma
could
hardly
suppose
they
would
presume
to
invite
 
neither
Donwell
,
nor
Hartfield
,
nor
randall
.
<EOS>
nothing
should
tempt
_
her
_
<EOS>
to
go
,
if
they
do
;
and
she
regret
that
her
father
's
known
habit
would
be
give
her
refusal
less
meaning
than
she
could
wish
.
<EOS>
the
Coles
be
very
respectable
in
their
way
,
but
they
ought
to
be
teach
that
it
be
not
for
them
to
arrange
the
term
on
which
the
superior
family
would
visit
them
.
<EOS>
this
lesson
,
she
very
much
fear
,
they
would
receive
only
from
herself
;
she
have
little
hope
of
Mr.
Knightley
,
none
of
Mr.
Weston
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
have
make
up
her
mind
how
to
meet
this
presumption
so
many
week
before
it
appear
,
that
when
the
insult
come
at
last
,
it
find
her
very
differently
affect
.
<EOS>
Donwell
and
Randalls
have
receive
their
invitation
,
and
none
have
come
for
her
father
and
herself
;
and
Mrs.
Weston
's
accounting
for
it
with
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
they
will
not
take
the
liberty
with
you
;
they
know
you
do
not
dine
out
,
"
be
not
quite
sufficient
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
she
should
like
to
have
have
the
power
of
refusal
;
and
afterwards
,
as
the
idea
of
the
party
to
be
assemble
there
,
consist
precisely
of
those
whose
society
be
dear
to
her
,
occur
again
and
again
,
she
do
not
know
that
she
may
not
have
be
tempt
to
accept
.
<EOS>
Harriet
be
to
be
there
in
the
evening
,
and
the
Bateses
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
speak
of
it
as
they
walk
about
Highbury
the
day
before
,
and
Frank
Churchill
have
most
earnestly
lament
her
absence
.
<EOS>
may
not
the
evening
end
in
a
dance
?
<EOS>
have
be
a
question
of
his
.
<EOS>
the
bare
possibility
of
it
act
as
a
farth
irritation
on
her
spirit
;
and
her
be
leave
in
solitary
grandeur
,
even
suppose
the
omission
to
be
intend
as
a
compliment
,
be
but
poor
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
arrival
of
this
very
invitation
while
the
Westons
be
at
Hartfield
,
which
make
their
presence
so
acceptable
;
for
though
her
first
remark
,
on
read
it
,
be
that
"
of
course
it
must
be
decline
,
"
she
so
very
soon
proceed
to
ask
them
what
they
advise
her
to
do
,
that
their
advice
for
her
go
be
most
prompt
and
successful
.
  
<EOS>
She
own
that
,
consider
every
thing
,
she
be
not
absolutely
without
inclination
for
the
party
.
<EOS>
the
Coles
express
themselves
so
properly
 
there
be
so
much
real
attention
in
the
manner
of
it
 
so
much
consideration
for
her
father
.
<EOS>
"
They
would
have
solicit
the
honour
earlier
,
but
have
be
wait
the
arrival
of
a
fold
-
screen
from
London
,
which
they
hope
may
keep
Mr.
Woodhouse
from
any
draught
of
air
,
and
therefore
induce
him
the
more
readily
to
give
them
the
honour
of
his
company
.
<EOS>
"
upon
the
whole
,
she
be
very
persuadable
;
and
it
be
briefly
settle
among
themselves
how
it
may
be
do
without
neglect
his
comfort
 
how
certainly
Mrs.
Goddard
,
if
not
Mrs.
Bates
,
may
be
depend
on
for
bear
him
company
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
be
to
be
talk
into
an
acquiescence
of
his
daughter
be
go
out
to
dinner
on
a
day
now
near
at
hand
,
and
spend
the
whole
evening
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
as
for
_
his
_
go
,
Emma
do
not
wish
him
to
think
it
possible
,
the
hour
would
be
too
late
,
and
the
party
too
numerous
.
<EOS>
He
be
soon
pretty
well
resign
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
fond
of
dinner
-
visit
,
"
say
he
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
be

<EOS>
no
more

<EOS>
late
hour
do
not
agree
with
us

<EOS>
I
be
sorry
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Cole
should
have
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
be
much
well
if
they
would
come
in
one
afternoon
next
summer
,
and
take
their
tea
with
us
 
<EOS>
take
us
in
their
afternoon
walk
;
which
they
may
do
,
as
our
hour
be
so
reasonable
,
and
yet
get
home
without
be
out
in
the
damp
of
the
evening

<EOS>
the
dew
of
a
summer
evening
be
what
I
would
not
expose
any
body
to

<EOS>
however
,
as
they
be
so
very
desirous
to
have
dear
Emma
dine
with
them
,
and
as
you
will
both
be
there
,
and
Mr.
Knightley
too

to
take
care
of
her

I
can
not
wish
to
prevent
it

provide
the
weather
be
what
it
ought

<EOS>
neither
damp

nor
cold
,
nor
windy

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
turn
to
Mrs.
Weston
,
with
a
look
of
gentle
reproach
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
Miss
Taylor
,
if
you

cry
Mr.

as
I
take

away

it
be
incumbent
on
me
to
supply
her
place

if
I
can

I
will
step
to
Mrs.
Goddard
in

the

not

Mr.

<EOS>
the

know
better
how

<EOS>
Mr.

must
be
quiet

every

enough
for

He

be
happy
to

Mrs.
Goddard

He
have
a
great
regard
for
Mrs.
Goddard

and
Emma
should
write
a
line
,
and
invite
her
.
<EOS>
James
could
take
the
note
.
<EOS>
but
first
of
all
,
there
must
be
an
answer
write
to
Mrs.
Cole

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
make
my
excuse
,
my

as
civilly
as
possible

<EOS>
You
will
say
that
I
be
quite
an
invalid

and
go
no
where
,
and
therefore
must
decline
their
oblige
invitation
;
begin
with
my

of

<EOS>
but
you
will
do
every
thing
right
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
you
what
be
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
We
must
remember
to
let
James
know
that
the
carriage
will
be
want

Tuesday

<EOS>
I
shall
have
no

<EOS>
We
have
never

but
still
I
have
no
doubt
that
James
will
take
you
very
safely

<EOS>
and
when
you
get
there
,
you
must
tell
him
at
what
time
you
would
have
him
come
for
you
again
;
and
you
have
well
name
an
early
hour

You

You
will
get

you

away

I
be
tired

"
  
"
<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
no

you

there

You

Emma

<EOS>
They
be
good

natured
people

and
think
little
of
their
own
claim

still
they
must
feel
that
any

away

Miss

would
be
more
think
of

You

My

we

I

rather

you

<EOS>
"
oh
yes

<EOS>
I

on

I

She
love
piquet

but
when

home

I
be
afraid
you
will
be
sit
up
by
yourself
,
instead
of
go
to
bed
at
your
usual
time
 
and
the
idea
of
that
would
entirely
destroy
my
comfort

<EOS>
You
must
promise
me
not
to
sit
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
do
,
on
the
condition
of
some
promise
on
her
side
:
such
as
that
,
if
she
come
home
cold
,
she
would
be
sure
to
warm
herself
thoroughly
;
if
hungry
,
that
she
would
take
something
to
eat
;
that
her
own
maid
should
sit
up
for
her
;
and
that
Serle
and
the
butler
should
see
that
every
thing
be
safe
in
the
house
,
as
usual
.
    
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
come
back
again
;
and
if
he
keep
his
father
's
dinner
wait
,
it
be
not
know
at
Hartfield
;
for
Mrs.
Weston
be
too
anxious
for
his
be
a
favourite
with
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
to
betray
any
imperfection
which
could
be
conceal
.
  
<EOS>
He
come
back
,
have
have
his
hair
cut
,
and
laugh
at
himself
with
a
very
good
grace
,
but
without
seem
really
at
all
ashamed
of
what
he
have
do
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
reason
to
wish
his
hair
longer
,
to
conceal
any
confusion
of
face
;
no
reason
to
wish
the
money
unspent
,
to
improve
his
spirit
.
<EOS>
He
be
quite
as
undaunted
and
as
lively
as
ever
;
and
,
after
see
him
,
Emma
thus
moralise
to
herself
:
    
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
whether
it
ought
to
be
so
,
but
certainly
silly
thing
do
cease
to
be
silly
if
they
be
do
by
sensible
people
in
an
impudent
way
.
<EOS>
wickedness
be
always
wickedness
,
but
folly
be
not
always
folly
.
 
<EOS>
It
depend
upon
the
character
of
those
who
handle
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
,
he
be
_
not
_
a
trifling
,
silly
young
man
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
,
he
would
have
do
this
differently
.
<EOS>
He
would
either
have
glory
in
the
achievement
,
or
be
ashamed
of
it
.
<EOS>
there
would
have
be
either
the
ostentation
of
a
coxcomb
,
or
the
evasion
of
a
mind
too
weak
to
defend
its
own
vanity
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
I
be
perfectly
sure
that
he
be
not
trifle
or
silly
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
Tuesday
come
the
agreeable
prospect
of
see
him
again
,
and
for
a
long
time
than
hitherto
;
of
judging
of
his
general
manner
,
and
by
inference
,
of
the
meaning
of
his
manner
towards
herself
;
of
guess
how
soon
it
may
be
necessary
for
her
to
throw
coldness
into
her
air
;
and
of
fancy
what
the
observation
of
all
those
may
be
,
who
be
now
see
them
together
for
the
first
time
.
  
<EOS>
She
mean
to
be
very
happy
,
in
spite
of
the
scene
be
lay
at
Mr.
Cole
's
;
and
without
be
able
to
forget
that
among
the
failing
of
Mr.
Elton
,
even
in
the
day
of
his
favour
,
none
have
disturb
her
more
than
his
propensity
to
dine
with
Mr.
Cole
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
's
comfort
be
amply
secure
,
Mrs.
Bates
as
well
as
<EOS>
Mrs.
Goddard
be
able
to
come
;
and
her
last
pleasing
duty
,
before
she
leave
the
house
,
be
to
pay
her
respect
to
them
as
they
sit
together
after
dinner
;
and
while
her
father
be
fondly
notice
the
beauty
of
her
dress
,
to
make
the
two
lady
all
the
amend
in
her
power
,
by
help
them
to
large
slice
of
cake
and
full
glass
of
wine
,
for
whatever
unwilling
self
-
denial
his
care
of
their
constitution
may
have
oblige
them
to
practise
during
the
meal
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
provide
a
plentiful
dinner
for
them
;
she
wish
she
could
know
that
they
have
be
allow
to
eat
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
follow
another
carriage
to
Mr.
Cole
's
door
;
and
be
pleased
to
see
that
it
be
Mr.
Knightley
's
;
for
Mr.
Knightley
keep
no
horse
,
have
little
spare
money
and
a
great
deal
of
health
,
activity
,
and
independence
,
be
too
apt
,
in
Emma
's
opinion
,
to
get
about
as
he
could
,
and
not
use
his
carriage
so
often
as
become
the
owner
of
Donwell
Abbey
.
<EOS>
She
have
an
opportunity
now
of
speak
her
approbation
while
warm
from
her
heart
,
for
he
stop
to
hand
her
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
come
as
you
should
do
,
"
say
she
;
"
like
a
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
quite
glad
to
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
thank
her
,
observe
,
"
how
lucky
that
we
should
arrive
at
the
same
moment
!
<EOS>
for
,
if
we
have
meet
first
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
I
doubt
whether
you
would
have
discern
me
to
be
more
of
a
gentleman
than
usual
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
not
have
distinguish
how
I
come
,
by
my
look
or
manner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
I
should
,
I
be
sure
I
should
.
<EOS>
there
be
always
a
look
of
consciousness
or
bustle
when
people
come
in
a
way
which
they
know
to
be
beneath
them
.
<EOS>
You
think
you
carry
it
off
very
well
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
but
with
you
it
be
a
sort
of
bravado
,
an
air
of
affect
unconcern
;
I
always
observe
it
whenever
I
meet
you
under
those
circumstance
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
now
_
you
have
nothing
to
try
for
.
<EOS>
You
be
not
afraid
of
be
suppose
ashamed
.
<EOS>
You
be
not
strive
to
look
tall
than
any
body
else
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
now
_
I
shall
really
be
very
happy
to
walk
into
the
same
room
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nonsensical
girl
!
<EOS>
"
be
his
reply
,
but
not
at
all
in
anger
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
have
as
much
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
the
rest
of
the
party
as
with
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
She
be
receive
with
a
cordial
respect
which
could
not
but
please
,
and
give
all
the
consequence
she
could
wish
for
.
<EOS>
when
the
Westons
arrive
,
the
kind
look
of
love
,
the
strong
of
admiration
be
for
her
,
from
both
husband
and
wife
;
the
son
approach
her
with
a
cheerful
eagerness
which
mark
her
as
his
peculiar
object
,
and
at
dinner
she
find
him
seat
by
her
 
<EOS>
and
,
as
she
firmly
believe
,
not
without
some
dexterity
on
his
side
.
  
<EOS>
the
party
be
rather
large
,
as
it
include
one
other
family
,
a
proper
unobjectionable
country
family
,
whom
the
Coles
have
the
advantage
of
name
among
their
acquaintance
,
and
the
male
part
of
Mr.
Cox
's
family
,
the
lawyer
of
Highbury
.
<EOS>
the
less
worthy
female
be
to
come
in
the
evening
,
with
Miss
Bates
,
Miss
Fairfax
,
and
Miss
Smith
;
but
already
,
at
dinner
,
they
be
too
numerous
for
any
subject
of
conversation
to
be
general
;
and
,
while
politic
and
Mr.
Elton
be
talk
over
,
Emma
could
fairly
surrender
all
her
attention
to
the
pleasantness
of
her
neighbour
.
<EOS>
the
first
remote
sound
to
which
she
feel
herself
oblige
to
attend
,
be
the
name
of
Jane
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cole
seem
to
be
relate
something
of
her
that
be
expect
to
be
very
interesting
.
<EOS>
She
listen
,
and
find
it
well
worth
listen
to
.
<EOS>
that
very
dear
part
of
Emma
,
her
fancy
,
receive
an
amusing
supply
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cole
be
tell
that
she
have
be
call
on
Miss
Bates
,
and
as
soon
as
she
enter
the
room
have
be
strike
by
the
sight
of
a
pianoforte
 
a
very
elegant
look
instrument
 
not
a
grand
,
but
a
large
-
sized
square
pianoforte
;
and
the
substance
of
the
story
,
the
end
of
all
the
dialogue
which
ensue
of
surprize
,
and
inquiry
,
and
congratulation
on
her
side
,
and
explanation
on
Miss
Bates
's
,
be
,
that
this
pianoforte
have
arrive
from
Broadwood
's
the
day
before
,
to
the
great
astonishment
of
both
aunt
and
niece
 
entirely
unexpected
;
that
at
first
,
by
Miss
Bates
's
account
,
Jane
herself
be
quite
at
a
loss
,
quite
bewilder
to
think
who
could
possibly
have
order
it
 
<EOS>
but
now
,
they
be
both
perfectly
satisfied
that
it
could
be
from
only
one
quarter
;
 
of
course
it
must
be
from
Colonel
Campbell
.
  
<EOS>
"
one
can
suppose
nothing
else
,
"
add
Mrs.
Cole
,
"
and
I
be
only
surprize
that
there
could
ever
have
be
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
but
Jane
,
it
seem
,
have
a
letter
from
them
very
lately
,
and
not
a
word
be
say
about
it
.
<EOS>
She
know
their
way
best
;
but
I
should
not
consider
their
silence
as
any
reason
for
their
not
mean
to
make
the
present
.
<EOS>
They
may
chuse
to
surprize
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cole
have
many
to
agree
with
her
;
every
body
who
speak
on
the
subject
be
equally
convinced
that
it
must
come
from
Colonel
Campbell
,
and
equally
rejoice
that
such
a
present
have
be
make
;
and
there
be
enough
ready
to
speak
to
allow
Emma
to
think
her
own
way
,
and
still
listen
to
Mrs.
Cole
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
declare
,
I
do
not
know
when
I
have
hear
any
thing
that
have
give
me
more
satisfaction
!
 
<EOS>
It
always
have
quite
hurt
me
that
Jane
Fairfax
,
who
play
so
delightfully
,
should
not
have
an
instrument
.
<EOS>
It
seem
quite
a
shame
,
especially
consider
how
many
house
there
be
where
fine
instrument
be
absolutely
throw
away
.
<EOS>
this
be
like
give
ourselves
a
slap
,
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
and
it
be
<EOS>
but
yesterday
I
be
tell
Mr.
Cole
,
I
really
be
ashamed
to
look
at
our
new
grand
pianoforte
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
while
I
do
not
know
one
note
from
another
,
and
our
little
girl
,
who
be
but
just
begin
,
perhaps
may
never
make
any
thing
of
it
;
and
there
be
poor
Jane
Fairfax
,
who
be
mistress
of
music
,
have
not
any
thing
of
the
nature
of
an
instrument
,
not
even
the
pitifull
old
spinet
in
the
world
,
to
amuse
herself
with
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
say
this
to
Mr.
Cole
but
<EOS>
yesterday
,
and
he
quite
agree
with
me
;
only
he
be
so
particularly
fond
of
music
that
he
could
not
help
indulge
himself
in
the
purchase
,
hope
that
some
of
our
good
neighbour
may
be
so
oblige
occasionally
to
put
it
to
a
well
use
than
we

;

that
really
be
the
reason
why
the
instrument
be
buy
 
or
else

I
be
sure
we
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
in
great
hope
that
Miss
Woodhouse
may
be
prevail
with
to
try
it
this
evening

Miss
Woodhouse
make
the
proper
acquiescence

find
that
nothing

pleasure

liberal

"
perhaps
Miss

have
never
be
stay
here
so
long
before

<EOS>
"
or
that
he
do
not
give
her
the
use

it

<EOS>

You
may

I
smile
because

at

I
do
not

what
do

"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Dixon
!
<EOS>
very
true
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
think
of
Mrs.
Dixon
.
<EOS>
She
must
know
as
well
as
her
father
,
how
acceptable
an
instrument
would
be
;
and
perhaps
the
mode
of
it
,
the
mystery
,
the
surprize
,
be
more
like
a
young
woman
's
scheme
than
an
elderly
man

.
<EOS>
It
be
Mrs.
Dixon
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
that
your
suspicion
would
guide
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
so
,
you
must
extend
your
suspicion

comprehend
_
Mr

Dixon
in
them

"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Dixon
.
 
<EOS>
very
well
.
<EOS>
yes
,
I
immediately
perceive
that
it
must
be
the
joint
present
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Dixon
.
<EOS>
We
be
speak
the
other
day
,
you
know
,
of
his
be
so
warm
an
admirer
of
her
performance
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
and
what
you
tell
me
on
that
head
,
confirm
an
idea
which
I
have
entertain
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
reflect
upon
the
good
intention
of
either
Mr.
Dixon
or
Miss
Fairfax
,
but
I
can
not
help
suspect
either
that
,
after
make
his
proposal
to
her
friend
,
he
have
the
misfortune
to
fall
in
love
with
_
her
_
,
or
that
he
become
conscious
of
a
little
attachment
on
her
side
.
<EOS>
one
may
guess
twenty
thing
without
guess
exactly
the
right
;
but
I
be
sure
there
must
be
a
particular
cause
for
her
chuse
to
come
to
Highbury
instead
of
go
with
the
Campbells
to
Ireland
.
<EOS>
here
,
she
must
be
lead
a
life
of
privation
and
penance
;
there
it
would
have
be
all
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
pretence
of
try
her
native
air
,
I
look
upon
that
as
a
mere
excuse
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
summer
it
may
have
pass
;
but
what
can
any
body
's
native
air
do
for
them
in
the
month
of
January
,
February
,
and
March
?
<EOS>
good
fire
and
carriage
would
be
much
more
to
the
purpose
in
most
case
of
delicate
health
,
and
I
dare
say
in
her
's
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
require
you
to
adopt
all
my
suspicion
,
though
you
make
so
noble
a
profession
of
do
it
,
but
I
honestly
tell
you
what
they
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
,
upon
my
word
,
they
have
an
air
of
great
probability
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dixon
's
preference
of
her
music
to
her
friend
's
,
I
can
answer
for
be
very
decide
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
then
,
he
save
her
life
.
<EOS>
do
you
ever
hear
of
that
?
 
<EOS>
a
water
party
;
and
by
some
accident
she
be
fall
overboard

<EOS>
He
catch
her

He
do

I
be
there
 
one
of

party

be
you
really
?
 
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
but
you
observe
nothing
of
course
,
<EOS>
for
it
seem
to
be
a
new
idea
to
you

if
I
have
be
there
,
I
think
I
should
have
make
some
discovery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
you
would
;
but
I
,
simple
I
,
see
nothing
but
the
fact
,
that
Miss
Fairfax
be
nearly
dash
from
the
vessel
and
that
Mr.
Dixon
catch
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
work
of
a
moment
.
<EOS>
and
though
the
consequent
shock
and
alarm
be
very
great
and
much
more
durable
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
believe
it
be
half
an
hour
before
any
of
us
be
comfortable
again
 
<EOS>
yet
that
be
too
general
a
sensation
for
any
thing
of
peculiar
anxiety
to
be
observable
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
say
,
however
,
that
you
may
not
have
make
discovery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
conversation
be
here
interrupt
.
<EOS>
They
be
call
on
to
share
in
the
awkwardness
of
a
rather
long
interval
between
the
course
,
and
oblige
to
be
as
formal
and
as
orderly
as
the
other
;
but
when
the
table
be
again
safely
cover
,
when
every
corner
dish
be
place
exactly
right
,
and
occupation
and
ease
be
generally
restore
,
Emma
say
,
  
"
the
arrival
of
this
pianoforte
be
decisive
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
a
little
more
,
and
this
tell
me
quite
enough
.
<EOS>
depend
upon
it
,
we
shall
soon
hear
that
it
be
a
present
from
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Dixon
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
if
the
Dixons
should
absolutely
deny
all
knowledge
of
it
we
must
conclude
it
to
come
from
the
Campbells
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
be
sure
it
be
not
from

Campbells

Miss
Fairfax
know
it
be
not
from
the
Campbells

they
would
have
be
guess
at
first
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
have
be
puzzle
,
have
she
dare
fix
on
them
.
<EOS>
I
may
not
have
convince
you
perhaps
,

I
be
perfectly
convince
myself
that
Mr.
Dixon
be
a
principal
in
the
business

indeed
you
injure
me
if
you
suppose
me
unconvinced

<EOS>
Your
reasoning
carry
my
judgment
along
with
them
entirely
.
<EOS>
at
first
,
while
I
suppose
you
satisfy
that
Colonel
Campbell
be
the
giver
,
I
see
it
only
as
paternal
kindness
,
and
think
it
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
but
when
you
mention
Mrs.
Dixon
,
I
feel
how
much
more
probable
that
it
should
be
the
tribute
of
warm
female
friendship
.

and
now
I
can
see
it
in
no
other
light
than
as
an
offering
of
love

there

usual
rate
of

clever

a

downright
silly

by
much
the
large
proportion
neither
the

nothing
bad

remark

dull

old

watch
the
entree
of
her
own

little
friend

if
she
could
not
exult
in
her
dignity
and
grace
,
she
could
not
only
love
the
blooming
sweetness
and
the
artless
manner
,
but
could
most
heartily
rejoice
in
that
light
,
cheerful
,
unsentimental
disposition
which
allow
her
so
many
alleviation
of
pleasure

pang

nicely
dress

nicely
dress

to
sit
and
smile

look
pretty

nothing

enough
for
the
happiness
of
the
present
hour

Jane

do
look
and
move
superior

Emma
suspect
she
may
have
be
glad
to
change
feeling
with
Harriet

very
glad
to
have
purchase
the
mortification
of
have
love
 
<EOS>
yes

of
have
love

Mr.
Elton
in
vain
 
by
the
surrender

all
the
dangerous
pleasure

know
herself
belove

in
so
large
a
party
it
be
not
necessary
that

should
approach
her

do
not

speak

much
in

secret
herself

to
think
the
appearance

curiosity

interest
fair

therefore
purposely
keep
at

by
the

the

almost
immediately

see
the

consciousness
with
which
congratulation
be
receive

the

of
guilt

could
not

be
amuse
at
her
perseverance
in
dwell
on
the
subject

have
so
much
to
ask

totally
unsuspicious

as
little
about
it

plainly

early
be
Frank
Churchill

in

walk

the
first

the
handsome

after
pay
his

great

there
be
some
look
a

like

Emma
restrain
her
indignation

only
turn
from

in
silence

<EOS>
smile
of
intelligence
pass
between
her
and
the
gentleman
on
first
glance
towards
Miss
Fairfax
;
but
it
be
most
prudent
to
avoid
speech
.
<EOS>
He
tell
her
that
he
have
be
impatient
to
leave
the
dining
-
room
 
hate
sit
long
 
be
always
the
first
to
move
when
he
could
 
that
his
father
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
Mr.
Cox
,
and
Mr.
Cole
,
be
leave
very
busy
over
parish
business
 
<EOS>
that
as
long
as
he
have
staid
,
however
,
it
have
be
pleasant
enough
,
as
he
have
find
them
in
general
a
set
of
gentlemanlike
,
sensible
man
;
and
speak
so
handsomely
of
Highbury
altogether
 
think
it
so
abundant
in
agreeable
family
 
that
Emma
begin
to
feel
she
have
be
use
to
despise
the
place
rather
too
much
.
<EOS>
She
question
him
as
to
the
society
in
Yorkshire
 
<EOS>
the
extent
of
the
neighbourhood
about
Enscombe
,
and
the
sort
;
and
could
make
out
from
his
answer
that
,
as
far
as
Enscombe
be
concern
,
there
be
very
little
go
on
,
that
their
visiting
be
among
a
range
of
great
family
,
none
very
near
;
and
that
even
when
day
be
fix
,
and
invitation
accept
,
it
be
an
even
chance
that
Mrs.
Churchill
be
not
in
health
and
spirit
for
go
;
that
they
make
a
point
of
visit
no
fresh
person
;
and
that
,
though
he
have
his
separate
engagement
,
it
be
not
without
difficulty
,
without
considerable
address
_
at
_
<EOS>
_
times
_
,
that
he
could
get
away
,
or
introduce
an
acquaintance
for
a
night
.
  
<EOS>
She
see
that
Enscombe
could
not
satisfy
,
and
that
Highbury
,
take
at
its
good
,
may
reasonably
please
a
young
man
who
have
more
retirement
at
home
than
he
like
.
<EOS>
His
importance
at
Enscombe
be
very
evident
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
boast
,
but
it
naturally
betray
itself
,
that
he
have
persuade
his
aunt
where
his
uncle
could
do
nothing
,
and
on
her
laughing
and
notice
it
,
he
own
that
he
believe
(
except
one
or
two
point
)
<EOS>
he
could
_
with
_
<EOS>
_
time

persuade
her
to
any
thing

one
of
those
point
on
which
his

want
very
much
to
go
abroad

be
very
eager

the
unpersuadable
point

good

"
I

go
immediately

Emma
soon
see
him
stand
before
Miss

and
talk
to
her
;

as
to
its
effect
on
the
young
lady
,
as
he
have
improvidently
place
himself
exactly
between
them

exactly
in

of

she
could
absolutely
distinguish
nothing

before

My

I
have
be
make
discovery

plan

just
like
yourself

I
must
tell

be
fresh

you

<EOS>

very
true

<EOS>
well
,
a
little
while
ago
it
occur
to
me
how
very
sad
it
would
be
to
have
Jane
Fairfax
walk
home
again
,
late
at
night
,
and
cold
as
the
night
be
now
.
<EOS>
and
as
I
look
at
her
,
though
I
never
see
her
appear
to
more
advantage
,
it
strike
me
that
she
be
heat
,
and
would
therefore
be
particularly
liable
to
take
cold
.
<EOS>
poor
girl
!
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
it
;
so
,
as
soon
as
Mr.
Weston
come
into
the
room
,
and
I
could
get
at
him
,
I
speak
to
him
about
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
You
may
guess
how
readily
he
come
into
my
wish
;
and
have
his
approbation
,
I
make
my
way
directly
to
Miss
Bates
,
to
assure
her
that
the
carriage
would
be
at
her
service
before
it
take
us
home
;
for
I
think
it
would
be
make
her
comfortable
at
once
.
<EOS>
good
soul
!
<EOS>
she
be
as
grateful
as
possible
,
you
may
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
nobody
be
ever
so
fortunate
as
herself
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
with
many
,
many
thank
 
"
there
be
no
occasion
to
trouble
us
,
for
Mr.
Knightley
's
carriage
have
bring
,
and
be
to
take
them
home
again

<EOS>
"
I
be
quite
surprized
;
 
very
glad
,
I
be
sure
;
but
really
quite
surprized
.
<EOS>
such
a
very
kind
attention
 
and
so
thoughtful
an
attention
!
 
<EOS>
the
sort
of
thing
that
so
few
man
would
think
of
.
<EOS>
and
,
in
short
,
from
know
his
usual
way
,
I
be
very
much
inclined
to
think
that
it
be
for
their
accommodation
<EOS>
the
carriage
be
use
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
do
suspect
he
would
not
have
have
a
pair
of
horse
for
himself
,
and
that
it
be
only
as
an
excuse
for
assist
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
likely
,
"
say
Emma
 
"
nothing
more
likely
.
<EOS>
I
know
no
man
more
likely
than
Mr.
Knightley
to
do
the
sort
of
thing
 
to
do
any
thing
really
good
-
natured
,
useful
,
considerate
,
or
benevolent
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
gallant
man
,
but
he
be
a
very
humane
one
;
and
this
,
consider
Jane
Fairfax
's
ill
-
health
,
would
appear
a
case
of
humanity
to
him
;
 
and
for
an
act
of
unostentatious
kindness
,
there
be
nobody
whom
I
would
fix
on
more
than
on
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
have
horse
to
-
day
 
for
we
arrive
together
;
and
I
laugh
at
him
about
it
,
but
he
say
not
a
word
that
could
betray
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Mrs.
Weston
,
smile
,
"
you
give
him
credit
for
more
simple
,
disintereste
benevolence
in
this
instance
than
I
do
;
for
while
Miss
Bates
be
speak
,
a
suspicion
dart
into
my
head

I
have
never
be
able
to
get
it
out
again

<EOS>
the
more
I
think
of
it
,
the
more
probable
it
appear
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
have
make
a
match
between
Mr.
Knightley
and
Jane
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
see
the
consequence
of
keep
you
company
!
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
say
to
it
?

"
<EOS>
Mr.

exclaim
Emma

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dear
Mrs.
Weston
,
how
could
you
think
of
such
a
thing
?
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
!
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
must
not

!
 
<EOS>
You
would
not
have
little
Henry
cut
out
from
Donwell

<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
Henry
must
have
Donwell
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
at
all
consent
to
Mr.
Knightley
's
marrying
;
and
I
be
sure
it
be
not
at
all
likely
.
<EOS>
I
be
amazed
that
you
should
think
of
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Emma
,
I
have
tell
you
what
lead
me
to
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
the
match
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
to
injure
dear
little
Henry
 
<EOS>
but
the
idea
have
be
give
me
by
circumstance
;
and
if
Mr.
Knightley
really
wish
to
marry
,
you
would
not
have
him
refrain
on
Henry
's
account
,
a
boy
of
six
year
old
,
who
know
nothing
of
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
would
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
to
have
Henry
supplant
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
marry
!
 
<EOS>
no
,
I
have
never
have
such
an
idea
,
and
I
can
not
adopt
it
now
.
<EOS>
and
Jane
Fairfax
,
too
,
of
all
woman
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
she
have
always
be
a
first
favourite
with
him
,
as
you
very
well
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
the
imprudence
of
such
a
match
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
speak
of
its
prudence
;
merely
its
probability
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
no
probability
in
it
,
unless
you
have
any
well
foundation
than
what
you
mention
.
<EOS>
His
good
-
nature
,
his
humanity
,
as
I
tell
you
,
would
be
quite
enough
to
account
for
the
horse
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
great
regard
for
the
Bateses
,
you
know
,
independent
of
Jane
Fairfax
 
and
be
always
glad
to
shew
them
attention
.
<EOS>
My
dear
Mrs.
Weston
,
do
not
take
to
match
-
making
.
<EOS>
You
do
it
very
ill
.
<EOS>
Jane
Fairfax
mistress
of
the
Abbey
!
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
no
,
no
;
 
<EOS>
every
feeling
revolt
.
<EOS>
for
his
own
sake
,
I
would
not
have
him
do
so
mad
a
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
imprudent
,
if
you
please
 
but
not
mad
.
<EOS>
except
inequality
of
fortune
,
and
perhaps
a
little
disparity
of
age
,
I
can
see
nothing
unsuitable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
Mr.
Knightley
do
not
want
to
marry
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
he
have
not
the
least
idea
of
it
.
<EOS>
do
not
put
it
into
his
head
.
<EOS>
why
should
he
marry
?
 
<EOS>
He
be
as
happy
as
possible
by
himself
;
with
his
farm
,
and
his
sheep
,
and
his
library
,
and
all
the
parish
to
manage
;
and
he
be
extremely
fond
of
his
brother
's
child
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
occasion
to
marry
,
either
to
fill
up
his
time
or
his
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Emma
,
as
long
as
he
think
so
,
it
be
so
;
but
if
he
really
love
Jane
Fairfax
 
"
  
"
nonsense
!
<EOS>
He
do
not
care
about
Jane
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
in
the
way
of
love
,
I
be
sure
he
do
not
.
<EOS>
He
would
do
any
good
to
her
,
or
her
family
;
but
 
"
  
"
well
,
"
say
Mrs.
Weston
,
laugh
,
"
perhaps
the
great
good
he
could
do
them
,
would
be
to
give
Jane
such
a
respectable
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
it
would
be
good
to
her
,
I
be
sure
it
would
be
evil
to
himself
;
a
very
shameful
and
degrade
connexion
.
<EOS>
how
would
he
bear
to
have
Miss
Bates
belong
to
him
?
 
<EOS>
to
have
her
haunt
the
Abbey
,
and
thank
him
all
day
long
for
his
great
kindness
in
marry
Jane
?
 
<EOS>
"
so
very
kind
and
obliging
!
 
<EOS>
but
he
always
have
be
such
a
very
kind
neighbour
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
fly
off
,
through
half
a
sentence
,
to
her
mother
's
old
petticoat
.
<EOS>
"
not
that
it
be
such
a
very
old
petticoat
either
 
for
still
it
would
last
<EOS>
a
great
while
 
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
she
must
thankfully
say
that
their
petticoat
be
all
very
strong
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
for
shame
,
Emma
!
do
not
mimic
her
.
<EOS>
You
divert
me
against
my
conscience
.
<EOS>
and
,
upon
my
word
,
I
do
not
think
Mr.
Knightley
would
be
much
disturb
by
Miss
Bates
.
<EOS>
little
thing
do
not
irritate
him
.
<EOS>
She
may
talk
on
;
and
if
he
want
to
say
any
thing
himself
,
he
would
only
talk
louder
,
and
drown
her
voice
.
<EOS>
but
the
question
be
not
,
whether
it
would
be
a
bad
connexion
for
him
,
but
whether
he
wish
it
;
and
I
think
he
do
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
him
speak
,
and
so
must
you
,
so
very
highly
of
Jane
Fairfax
!
<EOS>
the
interest
he
take
in
her
 
his
anxiety
about
her
health
 
<EOS>
his
concern
that
she
should
have
no
happy
prospect
!
<EOS>
I
have
hear
him
express
himself
so
warmly
on
those
point
!
 
<EOS>
such
an
admirer
of
her
performance
on
the
pianoforte
,
and
of
her
voice
!
<EOS>
I
have
hear
him
say
that
he
could
listen
to
her
for
ever
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
and
I
have
almost
forget
one
idea
that
occur
to
me
 
this
pianoforte
that
have
be
send
here
by
somebody
 
though
we
have
all
be
so
well
satisfied
to
consider
it
a
present
from
the
Campbells
<EOS>
,
may
it
not
be
from
Mr.
Knightley
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
suspect
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
be
just
the
person
to
do
it
,
even
without
be
in
love
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
it
can
be
no
argument
to
prove
that
he
be
in
love
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
think
it
be
at
all
a
likely
thing
for
him
to
do
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
do
nothing
mysteriously
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
him
lament
her
have
no
instrument
repeatedly
;
oftener
than
I
should
suppose
such
a
circumstance
would
,
in
the
common
course
of
thing
,
occur
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
;
and
if
he
have
intend
to
give
her
one
,
he
would
have
tell
her
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
may
be
scruple
of
delicacy
,
my
dear
Emma
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
very
strong
notion
that
it
come
from
him
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
he
be
particularly
silent
when
Mrs.
Cole
tell
us
of
it
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
take
up
an
idea
,
Mrs.
Weston
,
and
run
away
with
it
;
as
you
have
many
a
time
reproach
me
with
do
.
<EOS>
I
see
no
sign
of
attachment
 
<EOS>
I
believe
nothing
of
the
pianoforte
 
and
proof
only
shall
convince
me
that
Mr.
Knightley
have
any
thought
of
marry
Jane
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
combat
the
point
some
time
longer
in
the
same
way
;
Emma
rather
gain
ground
over
the
mind
of
her
friend
;
for
Mrs.
Weston
be
the
most
used
of
the
two
to
yield
;
till
a
little
bustle
in
the
room
shew
them
that
tea
be
over
,
and
the
instrument
in
preparation
;
 
and
at
the
same
moment
Mr.
Cole
approach
to
entreat
Miss
Woodhouse
would
do
them
the
honour
of
try
it
.
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
,
of
whom
,
in
the
eagerness
of
her
conversation
with
Mrs.
Weston
,
she
have
be
see
nothing
,
except
that
he
have
find
a
seat
by
Miss
Fairfax
,
follow
Mr.
Cole
,
to
add
his
very
pressing
entreaty
;
and
as
,
in
every
respect
,
it
suit
Emma
best
to
lead
,
she
give
a
very
proper
compliance
.
  
<EOS>
She
know
the
limitation
of
her
own
power
too
well
to
attempt
more
than
she
could
perform
with
credit

she
want
neither
taste

the
little
thing

generally
acceptable
,
and
could
accompany
her
own
voice
well
.
<EOS>
one
accompaniment
to
her
song
take
her
agreeably
by
surprize
 
a
second
,
slightly
but
correctly
take
by
Frank
Churchill
.
<EOS>
Her
pardon
be
duly
beg
at
the
close
of
the
song
,
and
every
thing
usual
follow
.
<EOS>
He
be
accuse
of
have
a
delightful
voice
,
and
a
perfect
knowledge
of
music
;
which
be
properly
deny
;
and
that
he
know
nothing
of
the
matter
,
and
have
no
voice
at
all
,
roundly
assert
.
<EOS>
They
sing
together
once
more
;
and
Emma
would
then
resign
her
place
to
Miss
Fairfax
,
whose
performance
,
both
vocal
and
instrumental
,
she
never
could
attempt
to
conceal
from
herself
,
be
infinitely
superior
to
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
with
mixed
feeling
,
she
seat
herself
at
a
little
distance
from
the
number
round
the
instrument
,
to
listen
.
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
sing
again
.
<EOS>
They
have
sing
together
once
or
twice
,
it
appear
,
at
Weymouth
.
<EOS>
but
the
sight
of
Mr.
Knightley
among
the
most
attentive
,
soon
draw
away
half
Emma
's
mind
;
and
she
fall
into
a
train
of
thinking
on
the
subject
of
Mrs.
Weston
's
suspicion
,
to
which
the
sweet
sound
of
the
united
voices
give
only
momentary
interruption
.
<EOS>
Her
objection
to
Mr.
Knightley
's
marrying
do
not
in
the
least
subside
.
<EOS>
She
could
see
nothing
but
evil
in
it
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
great
disappointment
to
Mr.
John
Knightley
;
consequently
to
Isabella
.
<EOS>
a
real
injury
to
the
child
 
a
most
mortifying
change
,
and
material
loss
to
them
all
;
 
a
very
great
deduction
from
her
father
's
daily
comfort
 
and
,
as
to
herself
,
she
could
not
at
all
endure
the
idea
of
Jane
Fairfax
at
Donwell
Abbey
.
<EOS>
a
Mrs.
Knightley
for
them
all
to
give
way
to
!
 
<EOS>
no
 
Mr.
Knightley
must
never
marry
.
<EOS>
little
Henry
must
remain
the
heir
of
Donwell
.
  
<EOS>
presently
Mr.
Knightley
look
back
,
and
come
and
sit
down
by
her
.
<EOS>
They
talk
at
first
only
of
the
performance
.
<EOS>
His
admiration
be
certainly
very
warm
;
yet
she
think
,
but
for
Mrs.
Weston
,
it
would
not
have
strike
her
.
<EOS>
as
a
sort
of
touchstone
,
however
,
she
begin
to
speak
of
his
kindness
in
convey
the
aunt
and
niece
;
and
though
his
answer
be
in
the
spirit
of
cut
the
matter
short
,
she
believe
it
to
indicate
only
his
disinclination
to
dwell
on
any
kindness
of
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
often
feel
concern
,
"
say
she
,
"
that
I
dare
not
make
our
carriage
more
useful
on
such
occasion
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
I
be
without
the
wish
;
but
you
know
how
impossible
my
father
would
deem
it
that
James
should
put
-
to
for
such
a
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
quite
out
of
the
question
,
quite
out
of
the
question
,
"
he
reply
;
 
"
but
you
must
often
wish
it
,
I
be
sure
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
smile
with
such
seeming
pleasure
at
the
conviction
,
that
she
must
proceed
another
step
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
present
from
the
Campbells
,
"
say
she
 
<EOS>
"
this
pianoforte
be
very
kindly
give
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
he
reply
,
and
without
the
small
apparent
embarrassment
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
they
would
have
do
better
<EOS>
have
they
give
her
notice
of
it
.
<EOS>
surprize
be
foolish
thing
.
<EOS>
the
pleasure
be
not
enhance
,
and
the
inconvenience
be
often
considerable
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
expect
well
judgment
in
Colonel
Campbell
.
"
  
<EOS>
from
that
moment
,
Emma
could
have
take
her
oath
that
Mr.
Knightley
have
have
no
concern
in
give
the
instrument
.
<EOS>
but
whether
he
be
entirely
free
from
peculiar
attachment
 
whether
there
be
no
actual
preference
 
remain
a
little
longer
doubtful
.
<EOS>
towards
the
end
of
Jane
's
second
song
,
her
voice
grow
thick
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
will
do
,
"
say
he
,
when
it
be
finish
,
think
aloud
 
"
you
have
sing
quite
enough
for
one
evening
 
now
be
quiet
.
"
  
<EOS>
another
song
,
however
,
be
soon
beg
for
.
"
<EOS>
one
more
;
 
they
would
not
fatigue
Miss
Fairfax
on
any
account
,
and
would
only
ask
for
one
more
.
"
<EOS>
and
Frank
Churchill
be
hear
to
say
,
"
I
think
you
could
manage
this
without
effort
;
the
first
part
be
so
very
trifling
.
<EOS>
the
strength
of
the
song
fall
on
the
second
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
grow
angry
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
fellow
,
"
say
he
,
indignantly
,
"
think
of
nothing
but
shew
off
his
own
voice
.
<EOS>
this
must
not
be
.
"
<EOS>
and
touch
Miss
Bates
,
who
at
that
moment
pass
near
 
"
Miss
Bates
,
be
you
mad
,
to
let
your
niece
sing
herself
hoarse
in
this
manner
?
<EOS>
go
,
and
interfere
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
mercy
on
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Bates
,
in
her
real
anxiety
for
Jane
,
could
hardly
stay
even
to
be
grateful
,
before
she
stept
forward
and
put
an
end
to
all
farther
singe
.
<EOS>
here
cease
the
concert
part
of
the
evening
,
for
Miss
Woodhouse
and
Miss
Fairfax
be
the
only
young
lady

but
soon
(
within
five
minute
)

dance

nobody
exactly
know
where
 
be
so
effectually
promote
by
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Cole
,
that
every
thing
be
rapidly
clear
away
,
to
give
proper
space
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
,
capital
in
her
country
-
dance
,
be
seat
,
and
begin
an
irresistible
waltz
;
and
Frank
Churchill
,
come
up
with
most
become
gallantry
to
Emma
,
have
secure
her
hand
,
and
lead
her
up
to
the
top
.
  
<EOS>
while
wait
till
the
other
young
people
could
pair
themselves
off
,
Emma
find
time
,
in
spite
of
the
compliment
she
be
receive
on
her
voice
and
her
taste
,
to
look
about
,
and
see
what
become
of
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
this
would
be
a
trial
.
<EOS>
He
be
no
dancer
in
general
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
to
be
very
alert
in
engage
Jane
Fairfax
now
,
it
may
augur
something
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
immediate
appearance
.
<EOS>
no
;
he
be
talk
to
Mrs.
Cole
 
<EOS>
he
be
look
on
unconcerned
;
Jane
be
ask
by
somebody
else
,
and
he
be
still
talk
to
Mrs.
Cole
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
have
no
longer
an
alarm
for
Henry
;
his
interest
be
yet
safe
;
and
she
lead
off
the
dance
with
genuine
spirit
and
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
not
more
than
five
couple
could
be
muster
;
but
the
rarity
and
the
suddenness
of
it
make
it
very
delightful
,
and
she
find
herself
well
match
in
a
partner
.
<EOS>
They
be
a
couple
worth
look
at
.
  
<EOS>
two
dance
,
unfortunately
,
be
all
that
could
be
allow
.
<EOS>
It
be
grow
late
,
and
Miss
Bates
become
anxious
to
get
home
,
on
her
mother
's
account
.
<EOS>
after
some
attempt
,
therefore
,
to
be
permit
to
begin
again
,
they
be
oblige
to
thank
Mrs.
Weston
,
look
sorrowful
,
and
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
it
be
as
well
,
"
say
Frank
Churchill
,
as
he
attend
Emma
to
her
carriage
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
ask
Miss
Fairfax
,
and
her
languid
dancing
would
not
have
agree
with
me
,
after
yours
.
"
    
<EOS>
Emma
do
not
repent
her
condescension
in
go
to
the
Coles
.
<EOS>
the
visit
afford
her
many
pleasant
recollection
the
next
day
;
and
all
that
she
may
be
suppose
to
have
lose
on
the
side
of
dignified
seclusion
,
must
be
amply
repay
in
the
splendour
of
popularity
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
delight
the
Coles
 
worthy
people
,
who
deserve
to
be
make
happy
!
 
<EOS>
and
leave
a
name
behind
her
that
would
not
soon
die
away
.
  
<EOS>
perfect
happiness
,
even
in
memory
,
be
not
common
;
and
there
be
two
point
on
which
she
be
not
quite
easy
.
<EOS>
She
doubt
whether
she
have
not
transgress
the
duty
of
woman
by
woman
,
in
betray
her
suspicion
of
Jane
Fairfax
's
feeling
to
Frank
Churchill
.
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
right
;
but
it
have
be
so
strong
an
idea
,
that
it
would
escape
her
,
and
his
submission
to
all
that
she
tell
,
be
a
compliment
to
her
penetration
,
which
make
it
difficult
for
her
to
be
quite
certain
that
she
ought
to
have
hold
her
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
the
other
circumstance
of
regret
relate
also
to
Jane
Fairfax
;
and
there
she
have
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
She
do
unfeignedly
and
unequivocally
regret
the
inferiority
of
her
own
playing
and
singing
.
<EOS>
She
do
most
heartily
grieve
over
the
idleness
of
her
childhood
 
and
sit
down
and
practise
vigorously
an
hour
and
a
half
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
then
interrupt
by
Harriet
's
come
in
;
and
if
Harriet
's
praise
could
have
satisfy
her
,
she
may
soon
have
be
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
if
I
could
but
play
as
well
as
you
and
Miss
Fairfax
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
class
us
together
,
Harriet
.
<EOS>
My
playing
be
no
more
like
her
be
,
than
a
lamp
be
like
sunshine
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
dear
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
play
the
good
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
play
quite
as
well
as
she
do
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
have
much
rather
hear
you
.
<EOS>
every
body
last
night
say
how
well
you
play
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
those
who
know
any
thing
about
it
,
must
have
feel
the
difference
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
Harriet
,
that
my
playing
be
just
good
enough
to
be
praise
,
but
Jane
Fairfax
's
be
much
beyond
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
always
shall
think
that
you
play
quite
as
well
as
she
do
,
or
that
if
there
be
any
difference
nobody
would
ever
find
it
out
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cole
say
how
much
taste
you
have
;
and
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
talk
a
great
deal
about
your
taste
,
and
that
he
value
taste
much
more
than
execution
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
but
Jane
Fairfax
have
them
both
,
Harriet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
sure
?
<EOS>
I
see
she
have
execution
,
but
I
do
not
know
she
have
any
taste
.
<EOS>
nobody
talk
about
it
.
<EOS>
and
I
hate
italian
singing
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
understand
a
word
of
it
.
<EOS>
besides
,
if
she
do
play
so
very
well
,
you
know
,
it
be
no
more
than
she
be
oblige
to
do
,
because
she
will
have
to
teach
.

the
Coxes
be
wonder
last
night
whether
she
would
get
into
any
great
family

how
do
you
think
the
Coxes
look
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
just
as
they
always
do
 
very
vulgar
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
tell
me
something
,
"
say
Harriet
rather
hesitatingly
;
"
but
it
be
nothing
of
any
consequence

"
  
<EOS>
Emma
be
oblige
to
ask
what
they
have
tell
her

though
fearful
of
its

Mr.
Elton

They
tell
me
 
that

He

a
great
deal

especially
Anne

do
not

me
if

there
again

the
lively
object
she

butcher

his
tray

a
tidy
old
woman

homeward
from

know
she

I
be

I
be

and
while
Mrs.
Weston
pay
her
visit
,
I
may
be
allow
,
I
hope
,
"
say
Frank
Churchill
,
"
to
join
your
party

for
her
at
Hartfield
 
if
you
be

home

<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
be
disappoint

<EOS>
"
I
think
you
mean
to
go
with
me
.
<EOS>
They
would
be
very
much
pleased
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Me
!
<EOS>
I
should
be
quite
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
but
,
perhaps
 
I
may
be
equally
in
the
way
here
.
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
look
as
if
she
do
not
want
me
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
always
send
me
off
when
she
be
shop
.
<EOS>
She
say
I
fidget
her
to
death
;
and
Miss
Woodhouse
look
as
if
she
could
almost
say
the
same
.
<EOS>
what
be
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
here
on
no

Emma

I
be
only
wait
for
my
friend

<EOS>
She
will
probably
have
soon
do
,
and
then
we
shall
go
home
.
<EOS>
but
you
have
better
go
with
Mrs.
Weston
and
hear
the
instrument
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
 
if
you
advise
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
(
with
a
smile
)
if
Colonel
Campbell
should
have
employ
a
careless
friend
,
and
if
it
should
prove
to
have
an
indifferent
tone
 
<EOS>
what
shall
I
say
?
<EOS>
I
shall
be
no
support
to
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
She
may
do
very
well
by
herself
.
<EOS>
a
disagreeable
truth
would
be
palatable
through
her
lip
,
but
I
be
the
wretched
being
in
the
world
at
a
civil
falsehood

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
any
such
thing
,
"
reply
Emma
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
persuade
that
you
can
be
as
insincere
as
your
neighbour
,
when
it
be
necessary
;
but
there
be
no
reason
to
suppose
the
instrument
be
indifferent
.
<EOS>
quite
otherwise
indeed
,
if
I
understand
Miss
Fairfax
's
opinion
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
come
with
me
,
"
say
Mrs.
Weston
,
"
if
it
be
not
very
disagreeable
to
you

<EOS>
It
need
not
detain
us
long
.
<EOS>
We
will
go
to
Hartfield
afterwards
.
<EOS>
We
will
follow
them
to
Hartfield

<EOS>
I
really
wish
you
to
call
with
me

<EOS>
It
will
be
feel
so
great
an
attention
!
<EOS>
and
I
always
think
you
mean
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
could
say
no
more
;
and
with
the
hope
of
Hartfield
to
reward
him
,
return
with
Mrs.
Weston
to
Mrs.
Bates
's
door
.
<EOS>
Emma
watch
them
in
,
and
then
join
Harriet
at
the
interesting
counter
,
 
try
,
with
all
the
force
of
her
own
mind
,
to
convince
her
that
if
she
want
plain
muslin
it
be
of
no
use
to
look
at
figure
;
and
that
a
blue
ribbon
,
be
it
ever
so
beautiful
,
would
still
never
match
her
yellow
pattern
.
<EOS>
at
last
it
be
all
settle
,
even
to
the
destination
of
the
parcel
.
  
<EOS>
"
Should
I
send
it
to
Mrs.
Goddard
's

madam

ask
Mrs.
Ford

yes
 
<EOS>
no

yes

to
Mrs.

only
my

gown
be
at
Hartfield

<EOS>
no
,
you
shall
send
it
to
Hartfield
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
Mrs.
Goddard
will
want
to
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
could
take
the
pattern
gown
home
any
day
.
<EOS>
but
I
shall
want
the
ribbon
directly

so
it
have
better
go
to
Hartfield
 
at

the
ribbon
.

You
could
make
it
into
two
parcel
,
Mrs.
Ford
,
could
not
you
?

"
It
be
not

the
obliging
Mrs.

<EOS>
oh
!

indeed
I
would
much
rather
have
it

well
have
it
send

take
it
home
with
me
at
night

<EOS>
voice
approach
the
shop

rather
one
voice

two
lady
:
Mrs.
Weston

Miss
Bates
meet
them
at
the
door

<EOS>
"
My

the

down

little
while

your
opinion

you

Miss
Smith

how
do
you
do
,
Miss
Smith
?
 
<EOS>
very
well
I
thank
you

<EOS>
and
I
beg
Mrs.

to
come
with
me
,
that
I
may
be
sure
of
succeed

<EOS>
"
I

Mrs.

very

delightfully
well

night

<EOS>
how
be
Mr.
Woodhouse

<EOS>
I
be
so
glad
to
hear
such
a
good
account

<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
tell
me
you
be
here
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
then
,
say
I
,
<EOS>
I
must
run
across
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
Miss
Woodhouse
will
allow
me
just
to
run
across
and
entreat
her
to
come
in
;
my
mother
will
be
so
very
happy
to
see
her
 
<EOS>
and
now
we
be
such
a
nice
party
,
she
can
not
refuse
.
 
<EOS>
"
aye
,
pray
do
,
"
say
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
,
"
Miss
Woodhouse
's
opinion
of
the
instrument
will
be
worth
have
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
but
,
say
I
,
I
shall
be
more
sure
of
succeed
if
one
of
you
will
go
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
"
say
he
,
"
wait
half
a
minute
,
till
I
have
finish
my
job
;
"
 
for
,
<EOS>
would
you
believe
it
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
there
he
be
,
in
the
most
obliging
manner
in
the
world
,
fasten
in
the
rivet
of
my
mother
's
spectacle
.
 
<EOS>
the
rivet
come
out
,
you
know
,
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
so
very
obliging
!
 
<EOS>
for
my
mother
have
no
use
of
her
spectacle
 
could
not
put
them
on
.
<EOS>
and
,
by
the
bye
,
every
body
ought
to
have
two
pair
of
spectacle
;
they
should
indeed
.
<EOS>
Jane
say
so
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
take
them
over
to
John
Saunders
the
first
thing
I
do
,
but
something
or
other
hinder
me
all
the
morning
;
first
one
thing
,
then
another
<EOS>
,
there
be
no
say
what
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
at
one
time
Patty
come
to
say
she
think
the
kitchen
chimney
want
sweep
.
<EOS>
oh
,
say
I
,
Patty
do
not
come
with
your
bad
news
to
me
.
<EOS>
here
be
the
rivet
of
your
mistress
's
spectacle
out
.
<EOS>
then
the
bake
apple
come
home
,
Mrs.
Wallis
send
them
by
her
boy
;
they
be
extremely
civil
and
obliging
to
us
,
the
Wallises
,
always
 
I
have
hear
some
people
say
that
Mrs.
Wallis
can
be
uncivil
and
give
a
very
rude
answer
,
but
we
have
never
know
any
thing
but
the
great
attention
from
them
.
<EOS>
and
it
can
not
be
for
the
value
of
our
custom
now
,
for
what
be
our
consumption
of
bread
,
you
know
?
<EOS>
only
three
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
besides
dear
Jane
at
present
 
<EOS>
and
she
really
eat
nothing
 
make
such
a
shocking
breakfast
<EOS>
,
you
would
be
quite
frightened
if
you
see
it
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
let
my
mother
know
how
little
she
eat
 
<EOS>
so
I
say
one
thing
<EOS>
and
then
I
say
another
,
and
it
pass
off
.
<EOS>
but
about
the
middle
of
the
day
she
get
hungry
,
and
there
be
nothing
she
like
so
well
as
these
bake
apple
,
and
they
be
extremely
wholesome
,
for
I
take
the
opportunity
the
other
day
of
ask
Mr.
Perry
;
I
happen
to
meet
him
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
not
that
I
have
any
doubt
before
 
I
have
so
often
hear
Mr.
Woodhouse
recommend
a
baked
apple
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
be
the
only
way
that
Mr.
Woodhouse
think
the
fruit
thoroughly
wholesome
.
<EOS>
We
have
apple
-
dumpling
,
however
,
very
often
.
<EOS>
Patty
make
an
excellent
apple
-
dumpling
.
<EOS>
well
,
Mrs.
Weston
,
you
have
prevail
,
I
hope
,
and
these
lady
will
oblige
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
would
be
"
very
happy
to
wait
on
Mrs.
Bates
,
&
c.
,
"
and
they
do
at
last
move
out
of
the
shop
,
with
no
farther
delay
from
Miss
Bates
than
,
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
do
,
Mrs.
Ford
?
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
you
before
.
<EOS>
I
hear
you
have
a
charming
collection
of
new
ribbon
from
town
.
<EOS>
Jane
come
back
delighted
yesterday
.
<EOS>
thank
ye
,
the
glove
do
very
well
 
only
a
little
too
large
about
the
wrist
;
but
Jane
be
take
them
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
I
talk
of
?
"
say
she
,
begin
again
when
they
be
all
in
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
wonder
on
what
,
of
all
the
medley
,
she
would
fix
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
declare
I
can
not
recollect
what
I
be
talk
of
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
my
mother
's
spectacle
.
<EOS>
so
very
obliging
of
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
"
say
he
,
"
I
do
think
I
can
fasten
the
rivet
;
I
like
a
job
of
this
kind
excessively
.
"
 
<EOS>
which
you
know
shew
him
to
be
so
very
....
<EOS>
indeed
I
must
say
that
,
much
as
I
have
hear
of
him
before
and
much
as
I
have
expect
,
he
very
far
exceed
any
thing
....
<EOS>
I
do
congratulate
you
,
Mrs.
Weston
,
most
warmly
.
<EOS>
He
seem
every
thing
the
fond
parent
could
....
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
say
he
,
"
I
can
fasten
the
rivet
.
<EOS>
I
like
a
job
of
that
sort
excessively
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
shall
forget
his
manner
.
<EOS>
and
when
I
bring
out
the
bake
apple
from
the
closet
,
and
hope
our
friend
would
be
so
very
obliging
as
to
take
some
,
"
oh
!
"
say
he
directly
,
"
there
be
nothing
in
the
way
of
fruit
half
so
good
,
and
these
be
the
finest
-
look
home
-
bake
apple
I
ever
see
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
that
,
you
know
,
be
so
very
....
<EOS>
and
I
be
sure
,
by
his
manner
,
it
be
no
compliment
.
<EOS>
indeed
they
be
very
delightful
apple
,
and
Mrs.
Wallis
do
them
full
justice
 
<EOS>
only
we
do
not
have
them
bake
more
than
twice
,
and
Mr.
Woodhouse
make
us
promise
to
have
them
do
<EOS>
three
time
 
but
Miss
Woodhouse
will
be
so
good
as
not
to
mention
it
.
<EOS>
the
apple
themselves
be
the
very
fine
sort
for
baking
,
beyond
a
doubt
;
all
from
Donwell
 
some
of
Mr.
Knightley
's
most
liberal
supply
.
<EOS>
He
send
us
a
sack
every
year
;
and
certainly
there
never
be
such
a
keep
apple
anywhere
as
one
of
his
tree
 
<EOS>
I
believe
there
be
two
of
them
.
<EOS>
My
mother
say
the
orchard
be
always
famous
in
her
young
day
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
really
quite
shock
the
other
day
 
for
Mr.
Knightley
call
one
morning
,
and
Jane
be
eat
these
apple
,
and
we
talk
about
them
and
say
how
much
she
enjoy
them
,
and
he
ask
whether
we
be
not
get
to
the
end
of
our
stock
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
you
must
be
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
I
will
send
you
another
supply
;
for
I
have
a
great
many
more
than
I
can
ever
use
.
<EOS>
William
Larkins
let
me
keep
a
large
quantity
than
usual
this
year
.
<EOS>
I
will
send
you
some
more
,
before
they
get
good
for
nothing
.
"
<EOS>
so
I
beg
he
would
not
 
for
really
as
to
ours
be
go
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
absolutely
say
that
we
have
<EOS>
a
great
many
leave
 
<EOS>
it
be
<EOS>
but
half
a
dozen
indeed
;
but
they
should
be
all
keep
for
Jane
;
and
I
could
not
at
all
bear
that
he
should
be
send
us
more
,
so
liberal
as
he
have
be
already
;
and
Jane
say
the
same
.
<EOS>
and
when
he
be
go
,
she
almost
quarrel
with
me
 
<EOS>
no
,
I
should
not
say
quarrel
,
for
we
never
have
a
quarrel
in
our
life
;
but
she
be
quite
distressed
that
I
have
own
the
apple
be
so
nearly
go
;
she
wish
I
have
make
him
believe
we
have
a
great
many
left
.
<EOS>
oh
,
say
I
,
my
dear
<EOS>
,
I
do
say
as
much
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
very
same
evening
William
Larkins
come
over
with
a
large
basket
of
apple
,
the
same
sort
of
apple
,
a
bushel
at
least
,
and
I
be
very
much
oblige
,
and
go
down
and
speak
to
William
Larkins
and
say
every
thing
,
as
you
may
suppose
.
<EOS>
William
Larkins
be
such
an
old
acquaintance

<EOS>
I
be
always
glad
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
I
find
afterwards
from
Patty
,
that
William
say
it
be
all
the
apple
of
_
that
_
sort
<EOS>
his
master
have
;
he
have
bring
them
all
 
<EOS>
and
now
his
master
have
not
one
leave
to
bake
or
boil
.
<EOS>
William
do
not
seem
to
mind
it
himself
,
he
be
so
pleased
to
think
his
master
have
sell
so
many
;
for
William
,
you
know
,
think
more
of
his
master
's
profit
than
any
thing
;
but
Mrs.
Hodges
,
he
say
,
be
quite
displeased
at
their
be
all
send
away
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
bear
that
her
master
should
not
be
able
to
have
another
apple
-
tart
this
spring
.
<EOS>
He
tell
Patty
this
,
but
bid
her
not
mind
it
,
and
be
sure
not
to
say
any
thing
to
us
about
it
,
for
Mrs.
Hodges
_
would
_
be
cross
sometimes
,
and
as
long
as
so
many
sack
be
sell
,
it
do
not
signify
who
eat
the
remainder
.
<EOS>
and
so
Patty
tell
me
,
and
<EOS>
I
be
excessively
shock
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
Mr.
Knightley
know
any
thing
about
it
for
the
world
!
<EOS>
He
would
be
so
very
....
<EOS>
I
want
to
keep
it
from
Jane
's
knowledge
;
but
,
unluckily
,
I
have
mention
it
before
I
be
aware
.

"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Bates
have
just
do
as
Patty
open

upstairs

<EOS>
the
appearance

tranquillity
itself

deprive
of

Frank

occupy
about

Jane

stand

back

intent
on

busy

what

"
say
Mrs.
Weston
,
"
have
not
you

an
unevenness
in

I
believe

we
have

wedge
one

be
very
kind
of

afraid
you

hurry
home

<EOS>
He
contrive
that
she
should
be
seat
by
him
;
and
be
sufficiently
employ
in
look
out
the
best
baked
apple
for
her
,
and
try
to
make
her
help
or
advise
him
in
his
work
,
till
Jane
Fairfax
be
quite
ready
to
sit
down
to
the
pianoforte
again
.
<EOS>
that
she
be
not
immediately
ready
,
Emma
do
suspect
to
arise
from
the
state
of
her
nerve
;
she
have
not
yet
possess
the
instrument
long
enough
to
touch
it
without
emotion
;
she
must
reason
herself
into
the
power
of
performance
;
and
Emma
could
not
but
pity
such
feeling
,
whatever
their
origin
,
and
could
not
but
resolve
never
to
expose
them
to
her
neighbour
again
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
Jane
begin
,
and
though
the
first
bar
be
feebly
give
,
the
power
of
the
instrument
be
gradually
do
full
justice
to
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
have
be
delight
before
,
and
be
delighted
again
;
Emma
join
her
in
all
her
praise
;
and
the
pianoforte
,
with
every
proper
discrimination
,
be
pronounce
to
be
altogether
of
the
high
promise

<EOS>
"
whoever
Colonel
Campbell

say
Frank
Churchill
,
with
a
smile
at
Emma

"
the
person
have
not
choose
ill

<EOS>
I
hear
a
good
deal
of
Colonel
Campbell
's
taste
at
Weymouth
;
and
the
softness
of
the
upper
note
I
be
sure
be
exactly
what
he
and
_
<EOS>
all
_
_
that
_
_
party
_
would
particularly
prize
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
,
Miss
Fairfax
,
that
he
either
give
his
friend
very
minute
direction
,
or
write
to
Broadwood
himself
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
Jane
do
not
look
round
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
oblige
to
hear
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
have
be
speak
to
her
at
the
same
moment

<EOS>
"
It
be
not
fair
,
"
say
Emma
,
in
a
whisper

"
mine
be
a
random
guess

<EOS>
do
not
distress
her

"
  
<EOS>
He
shake
his
head
with
a
smile
,
and
look
as
if
he
have
very
little
doubt
and
very
little
mercy
.
<EOS>
soon
afterwards
he
begin
again
,
  
<EOS>
"
how
much
your
friend
in
Ireland
must
be
enjoy
your
pleasure
on
this
occasion

Miss
Fairfax

<EOS>
I
dare
say
they
often
think
of
you

wonder
which
will
be
the
day
,
the
precise
day
of
the
instrument
be
come
to
hand

do
you
imagine
Colonel
Campbell
know
the
business
to
be
go
forward
just
at
this
time
?
 
<EOS>
do
you
imagine
it
to
be
the
consequence
of
an
immediate
commission
from
him
,
or
that
he
may
have
send
only
a
general
direction
,
an
order
indefinite
as
to
time
,
to
depend
upon
contingency

convenience

<EOS>
He
pause
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
but
hear
;
she
could
not
avoid
answer

<EOS>
"
till
I
have
a
letter
from
Colonel
Campbell

say
she
,
in
a
voice
of
force
calmness

"
I
can
imagine
nothing
with
any
confidence

It
must
be
all
conjecture

<EOS>
"
conjecture
 
aye

sometimes
one
conjecture
right

sometimes
one
conjecture
wrong

wish
I
could
conjecture
how
soon
I
shall
make
this
rivet
quite
firm

what
nonsense
one
talk

Miss
Woodhouse

when
hard
at

your

get
hold
of
a

Miss
Fairfax
say
something
about
conjecture

I
have
the
pleasure

<EOS>
He
be
very
warmly
thank
both
by
mother
and
daughter
;
to
escape
a
little
from
the
latter
,
he
go
to
the
pianoforte
,
and
beg
Miss
Fairfax
,
who
be
still
sit
at
it
,
to
play
something
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
be
very
kind

say
he
,

it
will
be
one
of
the
waltz

dance
last
night

let
me
live
them
over
again

You
do
not
enjoy
them
as
I
do

you
appear
tired
the
whole

believe
you

glad

what
felicity
it
be
to
hear
a
tune
again

make
one
happy

<EOS>
She
look
up
at
him
for
a
moment

colour
deeply
,

play
something
else

He
take
some
music
from
a
chair
near
the
pianoforte

turn
to
Emma

say
,

here

not

He
know
Miss
Fairfax
could
have
no
music
here

I
honour
that
part
of
the
attention
particularly
;
it
shew
it
to
have
be
so
thoroughly
from
the
heart

nothing
hastily
do

nothing
incomplete

prompt
it

<EOS>
Emma
wish
he
would
be
less
pointed
,
yet
could
not
help
be
amuse
;
and
when
on
glance
her
eye
towards
Jane
Fairfax
she
catch
the
remain
of
a
smile
,
when
she
see
that
with
all
the
deep
blush
of
consciousness

there
have
be
a
smile
of
secret
delight

she
have
less
scruple
in
the
amusement
,

much
less
compunction
with
respect
to
her

<EOS>
this
amiable
,
upright

perfect
Jane
Fairfax

apparently
cherish
very
reprehensible

bring
all
the
music

over
together

extremely
pleasant

<EOS>
do
you
ever
see
such
dancing
?
 
<EOS>
be
not
it
delightful
?
 
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
and
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
<EOS>
;
I
never
see
any
thing
equal
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
very
delightful
indeed
;
I
can
say
nothing
less
,
for
I
suppose
Miss
Woodhouse
and
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
be
hear
every
thing
that
pass
.
<EOS>
and
(
raise
his
voice
still
more
)
I
do
not
see
why
Miss
Fairfax
should
not
be
mention
too
.
<EOS>
I
think
Miss
Fairfax
dance
very
well
;
and
Mrs.
Weston
be
the
very
good
country
-
dance
player
,
without
exception
,
in
England
.
<EOS>
now
,
if
your
friend
have
any
gratitude
,
they
will
say
something
pretty
loud
about
you
and
me
in
return
;
but
I
can
not
stay
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
,
one
moment
more
;
something
of
consequence
 
<EOS>
so
shocked
!
 
<EOS>
Jane
and
I
be
both
so
shocked
about
the
apple
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
now
?
"
  
"
to
think
of
your
send
us
all
your
store
apple
.
<EOS>
You
say
you
have
a
great
many
,
and
now
you
have
not
one
leave
.
<EOS>
We
really
be
so
shocked
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hodges
may
well
be
angry
.
<EOS>
William
Larkins
mention
it
here
.
<EOS>
You
should
not
have
do
it
,
indeed
you
should
not

<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
he
be
off
.
<EOS>
He
never
can
bear
to
be
thank
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
he
would
have
staid
now
,
and
it
would
have
be
a
pity
not
to
have
mention
....
<EOS>
well
,
(
return
to
the
room
,
)
I
have
not
be
able
to
succeed
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
can
not
stop
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
Kingston

<EOS>
He
ask
me
if
he
could
do
any
thing
....
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes

Jane
,
"
we
hear
his
kind

every
thing

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
my
dear

I
dare
say
you
may
,
because
you
know
,
the
door
be
open
,
and
the
window
be
open
,
and
Mr.
Knightley
speak
loud
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
hear
every
thing
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
Can
I
do
any
thing
for
you
at
Kingston
?
"
say
he
;
so
I
just
mention
....
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
must
you
be
go
?
 
<EOS>
You
seem
but
just
come
 
so
very
obliging
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
find
it
really
time
to
be
at
home
;
the
visit
have
already
last
long
;
and
on
examine
watch
,
so
much
of
the
morning
be
perceive
to
be
go
,
that
Mrs.
Weston
and
her
companion
take
leave
also
,
could
allow
themselves
only
to
walk
with
the
two
young
lady
to
Hartfield
gate
,
before
they
set
off
for
Randalls
.
    
<EOS>
It
may
be
possible
to
do
without
dance
entirely
.
<EOS>
instance
have
be
know
of
young
people
pass
many
,
many
month
successively
,
without
be
at
any
ball
of
any
description

no
material
injury
accrue
either
to
body

when
a
beginning
be
make
 
<EOS>
when
the
felicity
of
rapid
motion
have
once
be
,
though
slightly
,
feel
 
it
must
be
a
very
heavy
set
that
do
not
ask
for
more
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
have
dance
once
at
Highbury
,
and
long
to
dance
again
;
and
the
last
half
-
hour
of
an
evening
which
Mr.
Woodhouse
be
persuade
to
spend
with
his
daughter
at
Randalls
,
be
pass
by
the
two
young
people
in
scheme
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Frank
's
be
the
first
idea
;
and
his
the
great
zeal
in
pursue
it
;
for
the
lady
be
the
good
judge
of
the
difficulty
,
and
the
most
solicitous
for
accommodation
and
appearance
.
<EOS>
but
still
she
have
inclination
enough
for
shew
people
again
<EOS>
how
delightfully
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
and
Miss
Woodhouse
dance
 
for
do
that
in
which
she
need
not
blush
to
compare
herself
with
Jane
Fairfax
 
and
even
for
simple
dancing
itself
,
without
any
of
the
wicked
aids
of
vanity
 
to
assist
him
first
in
pace
out
the
room
they
be
in
to
see
what
it
could
be
make
to
hold
 
and
then
in
take
the
dimension
of
the
other
parlour
,
in
the
hope
of
discover
,
in
spite
of
all
that
Mr.
Weston
could
say
of
their
exactly
equal
size
,
that
it
be
a
little
the
large
.
  
<EOS>
His
first
proposition
and
request
,
that
the
dance
begin
at
Mr.
Cole

should
be
finish
there
 
that
the
same
party
should
be
collect
,
and
the
same
musician
engage
,
meet
with
the
readiest
acquiescence
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
enter
into
the
idea
with
thorough
enjoyment
,
and
Mrs.
Weston
most
willingly
undertake
to
play
as
long
as
they
could
wish
to
dance
;
and
the
interesting
employment
have
follow
,
of
reckon
up
exactly
who
there
would
be
,
and
portion
out
the
indispensable
division
of
space
to
every
couple

<EOS>
"
You

will
be
three

there
will
be

my
father

myself
,
besides
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
yes
,
that
will
be
quite
enough
for
pleasure
.
<EOS>
You
and
Miss
Smith
,

Miss
Fairfax
,
will
be
three
,

the
two
Miss

five

for
five
couple
there
will
be
plenty
of
room

soon
it
come
to
be
on

side

will
there
be
good
room
for
five
couple

really
do
not

there
will

<EOS>
on
another
,

after
all
,
five
couple
be
not
enough
to
make
it
worth
while
to
stand
up
.
<EOS>
five
couple
be
nothing
,
when
one
think
seriously
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
do
to
_
invite
_
five
couple
.
<EOS>
It
can
be
allowable
only
as
the
thought
of
the
moment
.
"
  
<EOS>
somebody
say
that
_
Miss

Gilbert
be
expect
at
her
brother
's
,

must
be
invite
with
the
rest
.
<EOS>
somebody
else
believe
_
<EOS>
Mrs

.
<EOS>
Gilbert
would
have
dance
the
other
evening
,
if
she
have
be
ask
.
<EOS>
a
word
be
put
in
for
a
second
young
Cox
;
and
at
last
,
Mr.
Weston
name
one
family
of
cousin
who
must
be
include
,
and
another
of
very
old
acquaintance
who
could
not
be
leave
out
,
it
become
a
certainty
that
the
five
couple
would
be
at
least
ten
,
and
a
very
interesting
speculation
in
what
possible
manner
they
could
be
dispose
of
.
  
<EOS>
the
door
of
the
two
room
be
just
opposite
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
may
not
they
use
both
room
,
and
dance
across
the
passage
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
seem
the
good
scheme
;
and
yet
it
be
not
so
good
but
that
many
of
them
want
a
well
.
<EOS>
Emma
say
it
would
be
awkward
;
Mrs.
Weston
be
in
distress
about
the
supper
;
and
Mr.
Woodhouse
oppose
it
earnestly
,
on
the
score
of
health
.
<EOS>
It
make
him
so
very
unhappy
,
indeed
,
that
it
could
not
be
persevere
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
no
,
"
say
he
;
"
it
would
be
the
extreme
of
imprudence
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
it
for
Emma
!
 
<EOS>
Emma
be
not
strong
.
<EOS>
She
would
catch
a
dreadful
cold
.
<EOS>
so
would
poor
little
Harriet
.
<EOS>
so
you
would
all
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
,
you
would
be
quite
lay
up
;
do
not
let
them
talk
of
such
a
wild
thing
.
<EOS>
pray
do
not
let
them
talk
of
it
.
<EOS>
that
young
man
(
speak
lower
)
be
very
thoughtless
.
<EOS>
do
not
tell
his
father
,
but
that
young
man
be
not
quite
the
thing
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
open
the
door
very
often
this
evening
,
and
keep
them
open
very
inconsiderately
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
think
of
the
draught
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
set
you
against
him
,
but
indeed
he
be
not
quite
the
thing
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
be
sorry
for
such
a
charge
.
<EOS>
She
know
the
importance
of
it
,
and
say
every
thing
in
her
power
to
do
it
away
.
<EOS>
every
door
be
now
closed
,
the
passage
plan
give
up
,
and
the
first
scheme
of
dance
only
in
the
room
they
be
in
resort
to
again
;
and
with
such
good
-
will
on
Frank
Churchill
's
part
,
that
the
space
which
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
have
be
deem
barely
sufficient
for
five
couple
,
be
now
endeavour
to
be
make
out
quite
enough
for
ten
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
too
magnificent
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
We
allow
unnecessary
room
.
<EOS>
ten
couple
may
stand
here
very
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
demur
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
a
crowd
 
a
sad
crowd
;
and
what
could
be
bad
than
dance
without
space
to
turn
in
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
true
,
"
he
gravely
reply
;
"
it
be
very
bad
.
"
<EOS>
but
still
he
go
on
measure
,
and
still
he
end
with
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
there
will
be
very
tolerable
room
for
ten
couple

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
she
,
"
you
be
quite
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
dreadful
to
be
stand
so
close
!
<EOS>
nothing
can
be
farth
from
pleasure
than
to
be
dance
in
a
crowd
 
and
a
crowd
in
a
little
room
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
deny
it
,
"
he
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
agree
with
you
exactly
.
<EOS>
a
crowd
in
a
little
room
 
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
you
have
the
art
of
give
picture
in
a
few
word
.
<EOS>
Exquisite
,
quite
exquisite
!
 
<EOS>
still
,
however
,
have
proceed
so
far
,
one
be
unwilling
to
give
the
matter
up
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
disappointment
to
my
father
 
and
altogether
 
I
do
not
know
that
 
I
be
rather
of
opinion
that
ten
couple
may
stand
here
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
perceive
that
the
nature
of
his
gallantry
be
a
little
self
-
willed
,
and
that
he
would
rather
oppose
than
lose
the
pleasure
of
dance
with
her
;
but
she
take
the
compliment
,
and
forgave
the
rest
.
<EOS>
have
she
intend
ever
to
_
marry
<EOS>
_
him
,
it
may
have
be
worth
while
to
pause
and
consider
,
and
try
to
understand
the
value
of
his
preference
,
and
the
character
of
his
temper
;
but
for
all
the
purpose
of
their
acquaintance
,
he
be
quite
amiable
enough
.
  
<EOS>
before
the
middle
of
the
next
day
,
he
be
at
Hartfield
;
and
he
enter
the
room
with
such
an
agreeable
smile
as
certify
the
continuance
of
the
scheme
.
<EOS>
It
soon
appear
that
he
come
to
announce
an
improvement
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
"
he
almost
immediately
begin
,
"
<EOS>
your
inclination
for
dancing
have
not
be
quite
frightened
away
,
I
hope
,
by
the
terror
of
my
father
's
little
room
.
<EOS>
I
bring
a
new
proposal
on
the
subject
:
 
a
thought
of
my
father
's
,
which
wait
only
your
approbation
to
be
act
upon
.
<EOS>
May
I
hope
for
the
honour
of
your
hand
for
the
two
first
dance
of
this
little
project
ball
,
to
be
give
,
not
at
randall
,
but
at
the
Crown
Inn
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
Crown
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
if
you
and
Mr.
Woodhouse
see
no
objection
,
and
I
trust
you
can
not
,
my
father
hope
his
friend
will
be
so
kind
as
to
visit
him
there
.
<EOS>
well
accommodation
,
he
can
promise
them
,
and
not
a
less
grateful
welcome
than
at
randall
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
own
idea
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
see
no
objection
to
it
,
provide
you
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
this
be
what
we
all
feel
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
you
be
perfectly
right
!
<EOS>
ten
couple
,
in
either
of
the
Randalls
room
,
would
have
be
insufferable
!
 
<EOS>
Dreadful
!
 
<EOS>
I
feel
how
right
you
be
the
whole
time
,
but
be
too
anxious
for
secure
_
any
_
_
thing
_
to
like
to
yield
.
<EOS>
be
not
it
a
good
exchange
?
 
<EOS>
You
consent
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
consent
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
appear
to
me
a
plan
that
nobody
can
object
to
,
if
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
do
not
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
admirable
;
and
,
as
far
as
I
can
answer
for
myself
,
shall
be
most
happy
 
<EOS>
It
seem
the
only
improvement
that
could
be
.
<EOS>
Papa
,
do
you
not
think
it
an
excellent
improvement
?
<EOS>

<EOS>
She
be
oblige
to
repeat
and
explain
it
,
before
it
be
fully
comprehend
;
and
then
,
be
quite
new
,
farther
representation
be
necessary
to
make
it
acceptable
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
;
he
think
it
very
far
from
an
improvement
 
a
very
bad
plan
 
much
bad
than
the
other
.
<EOS>
a
room
at
an
inn
be
always
damp
and
dangerous
;
never
properly
air
,
or
fit
to
be
inhabit
.
<EOS>
if
they
must
dance
,
they
have
well
dance
at
randall
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
be
in
the
room
at
the
Crown
in
his
life
 
<EOS>
do
not
know
the
people
who
keep
it
by
sight
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
no
 
<EOS>
a
very
bad
plan
.
<EOS>
They
would
catch
bad
cold
at
the
Crown
than
anywhere
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
to
observe
,
sir
,
"
say
Frank
Churchill
,
"
that
one
of
the
great
recommendation
of
this
change
would
be
the
very
little
danger
of
any
body
's
catch
cold
 
<EOS>
so
much
less
danger
at
the
Crown
than
at
randall
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Perry
may
have
reason
to
regret
the
alteration
,
but
nobody
else
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
rather
warmly
,
"
you
be
very
much
mistake
if
you
suppose
Mr.
Perry
to
be
that
sort
of
character
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Perry
be
extremely
concerned
when
any
of
us
be
ill
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
understand
how
the
room
at
the
Crown
can
be
safe
for
you
than
your
father
's
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
from
the
very
circumstance
of
its
be
large
,
sir
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
no
occasion
to
open
the
window
at
all
 
not
once
the
whole
evening
;
and
it
be
that
dreadful
habit
of
open
the
window
,
let
in
cold
air
upon
heated
body
,
which
(
as
you
well
know
,
sir
)
do
the
mischief
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
open
the
window
!
 
<EOS>
but
surely
,
Mr.
Churchill
,
nobody
would
think
of
open
the
window
at
randall
.
<EOS>
nobody
could
be
so
imprudent
!
<EOS>
I
never
hear
of
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
dance
with
open
window
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
,
neither
your
father
nor
Mrs.
Weston
(
poor
Miss
Taylor
that
be
)
would
suffer
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
sir
 
but
<EOS>
a
thoughtless
young
person
will
sometimes
step
behind
a
window
-
curtain
,
and
throw
up
a
sash
,
without
its
be
suspect
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
know
it
do
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
have
you
indeed
,
sir
?
 
bless
me
!
<EOS>
I
never
could
have
suppose
it
.
<EOS>
but
I
live
out
of
the
world
,
and
be
often
astonish
at
what
I
hear
.
<EOS>
however
,
this
do
make
a
difference
;
and
,
perhaps
,
when
we
come
to
talk
it
over
 
<EOS>
but
these
sort
of
thing
require
a
good
deal
of
consideration
.
<EOS>
one
can
not
resolve
upon
them
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
will
be
so
obliging
as
to
call
here
one
morning
,
we
may
talk
it
over
,
and
see
what
can
be
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
unfortunately
,
sir
,
my
time
be
so
limited
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
oh
!
"
interrupt
Emma
,
"
there
will
be
plenty
of
time
for
talk
every
thing
over
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
hurry
at
all
.
<EOS>
if
it
can
be
contrive
to
be
at
the
Crown
,
papa
,
it
will
be
very
convenient
for
the
horse
.
<EOS>
They
will
be
so
near
their
own
stable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
they
will
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
that
be
a
great
thing
.
<EOS>
not
that
James
ever
complain
;
but
it
be
right
to
spare
our
horse
when
we
can
.
<EOS>
if
I
could
be
sure
of
the
room
be
thoroughly
air
 
but
be
Mrs.
Stokes
to
be
trust
?
<EOS>
I
doubt
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
her
,
even
by
sight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
answer
for
every
thing
of
that
nature
,
sir
,
because
it
will
be
under
Mrs.
Weston
's
care
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
undertake
to
direct
the
whole
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
,
papa
!
 
<EOS>
now
you
must
be
satisfied
 
<EOS>
Our
own
dear
Mrs.
Weston
,
who
be
carefulness
itself
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
remember
what
Mr.
Perry
say
,
so
many
year
ago
,
when
I
have
the
measle
?
<EOS>
"
if
_
Miss
_
_
Taylor
_
undertake
to
wrap
Miss
Emma
up
,
you
need
not
have
any
fear
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
how
often
have
I
hear
you
speak
of
it
as
such
a
compliment
to
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
aye
,
very
true
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Perry
do
say
so
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
it
.
<EOS>
poor
little
Emma
!
<EOS>
You
be
very
bad
with
the
measle
;
that
is
,
you
would
have
be
very
bad
,
but
for
Perry
's
great
attention
.
<EOS>
He
come
four
time
a
day
for
a
week
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
from
the
first
,
it
be
a
very
good
sort
 
which
be
our
great
comfort
;
but
the
measle
be
a
dreadful
complaint
.
<EOS>
I
hope
whenever
poor
Isabella
's
little
one
have
the
measle
,
she
will
send
for
Perry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
and
Mrs.
Weston
be
at
the
Crown
at
this
moment
,
"
say
Frank
Churchill
,
"
examine
the
capability
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
leave
them
there
and
come
on
to
Hartfield
,
impatient
for
your
opinion
,
and
hope
you
may
be
persuade
to
join
them
and
give
your
advice
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
I
be
desire
to
say
so
from
both
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
the
great
pleasure
to
them
,
if
you
could
allow
me
to
attend
you
there
.
<EOS>
They
can
do
nothing
satisfactorily
without
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
be
most
happy
to
be
call
to
such
a
council
;
and
her
father
,
engage
to
think
it
all
over
while
she
be
go
,
the
two
young
people
set
off
together
without
delay
for
the
Crown
.
<EOS>
there
be
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
;
delight
to
see
her
and
receive
her
approbation
,
very
busy
and
very
happy
in
their
different
way
;
she
,
in
some
little
distress
;
and
he
,
find
every
thing
perfect
.
  
<EOS>
"
Emma
,
"
say
she
,
"
this
paper
be
bad
than
I
expect
.
<EOS>
look
!
<EOS>
in
place
you
see
it
be
dreadfully
dirty
;
and
the
wainscot
be
more
yellow
and
forlorn
than
any
thing
I
could
have
imagine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
you
be
too
particular
,
"
say
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
all
that
signify
?
<EOS>
You
will
see
nothing
of
it
by
candlelight
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
as
clean
as
randall
by
candlelight
.
<EOS>
We
never
see
any
thing
of
it
on
our
club
-
night
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
lady
here
probably
exchange
look
which
mean
,
"
man
never
know
when
thing
be
dirty
or
not
;
"
and
the
gentleman
perhaps
think
each
to
himself
,
"
woman
will
have
their
little
nonsense
and
needless
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
one
perplexity
,
however
,
arise
,
which
the
gentleman
do
not
disdain
.
<EOS>
It
regard
a
supper
-
room
.
<EOS>
at
the
time
of
the
ballroom
's
be
build
,
supper
have
not
be
in
question
;
and
a
small
card
-
room
adjoining
,
be
the
only
addition
.
<EOS>
what
be
to
be
do
?
<EOS>
this
card
-
room
would
be
want
as
a
card
-
room
now
;
or
,
if
card
be
conveniently
vote
unnecessary
by
their
four
self
,
still
be
it
not
too
small
for
any
comfortable
supper
?
<EOS>
another
room
of
much
well
size
may
be
secure
for
the
purpose
;
but
it
be
at
the
other
end
of
the
house
,
and
a
long
awkward
passage
must
be
go
through
to
get
at
it
.
<EOS>
this
make
a
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
be
afraid
of
draught
for
the
young
people
in
that
passage
;
and
neither
Emma
nor
the
gentleman
could
tolerate
the
prospect
of
be
miserably
crowd
at
supper
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
propose
have
no
regular
supper
;
merely
sandwich
,
&
c.
,
set
out
in
the
little
room
;
but
that
be
scout
as
a
wretched
suggestion
.
<EOS>
a
private
dance
,
without
sit
down
to
supper
,
be
pronounce
an
infamous
fraud
upon
the
right
of
man
and
woman
;
and
Mrs.
Weston
must
not
speak
of
it
again
.
<EOS>
She
then
take
another
line
of
expediency
,
and
look
into
the
doubtful
room
,
observe
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
it
_
be
_
so
very
small
.
<EOS>
We
shall
not
be
many
,
you
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Weston
at
the
same
time
,
walk
briskly
with
long
step
through
the
passage
,
be
call
out
,
  
<EOS>
"
You
talk
a
great
deal
of
the
length
of
this
passage
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
mere
nothing
after
all
;
and
not
the
least
draught
from
the
stair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
"
say
Mrs.
Weston
,
"
one
could
know
which
arrangement
our
guest
in
general
would
like
good
.
<EOS>
to
do
what
would
be
most
generally
pleasing
must
be
our
object
 
if
one
could
but
tell
what
that
would
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
very
true
,
"
cry
Frank
,
"
very
true

<EOS>
You
want
your
neighbour
'
opinion
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
wonder
at
you
.
<EOS>
if
one
could
ascertain
what
the
chief
of
them
 
the
Coles
,
for
instance
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
far
off
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
call
upon
them
?
<EOS>
or
Miss
Bates
?
<EOS>
She
be
still
near
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
know
whether
Miss
Bates
be
not
as
likely
to
understand
the
inclination
of
the
rest
of
the
people
as
any
body
.
<EOS>
I
think
we
do
want
a
large
council
.
<EOS>
suppose
I
go
and
invite
Miss
Bates
to
join
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
 
if
you
please
,
"
say
Mrs.
Weston
rather
hesitate
,
"
if
you
think
she
will
be
of
any
use
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
get
nothing
to
the
purpose
from
Miss
Bates
,
"
say
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
She
will
be
all
delight
and
gratitude
,
but
she
will
tell
you
nothing
.
<EOS>
She
will
not
even
listen
to
your
question

<EOS>
I
see
no
advantage
in
consult
Miss
Bates
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
she
be
so
amusing
,
so
extremely
amusing
!
<EOS>
I
be
very
fond
of
hear
Miss
Bates
talk
.
<EOS>
and
I
need
not
bring
the
whole
family
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
Mr.
Weston
join
them
,
and
on
hear
what
be
propose
,
give
it
his
decide
approbation

<EOS>
"
aye
,
do
,
Frank
.
 
<EOS>
go
and
fetch
Miss
Bates
,
and
let
us
end
the
matter
at
once

<EOS>
She
will
enjoy
the
scheme

I
be
sure

I
do
not

us
how

away
difficulty

Mrs.
Weston

like
a
sweet
-
tempered
woman

a
good
wife

have
examine
the
passage
again
,
and
find
the
evil
of
it
much
less
than
she
have
suppose
before
 
indeed
very
trifling
;
and
here
end
the
difficulty
of
decision

<EOS>
all
the
rest

smooth

all

Mrs.
Stokes

<EOS>
every
body
invite
,
be
certainly
to
come
;
Frank
have
already
write
to
Enscombe
to
propose
stay
a
few
day
beyond
his
fortnight
,
which
could
not
possibly
be
refuse
.
<EOS>
and
a
delightful
dance
it
be
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
most
cordially
,
when
Miss
Bates
arrive
,
do
she
agree
that
it
must
.
<EOS>
as
a
counsellor
she
be
not
want
;
but
as
an
approver

(
a
much
safe

)
she
be
truly
welcome
.
<EOS>
Her
approbation
,
at
once
general
and
minute
,
warm
and
incessant
,
could
not
but
please
;
and
for
another
half
-
hour
they
be
all
walk
to
and
fro
,
between
the
different
room
,
some
suggest
,
some
attend
,
and
all
in
happy
enjoyment
of
the
future

<EOS>
the
party
do
not
break
up
without
Emma

be
positively
secure
for
the
two
first
dance
by
the
hero
of
the
evening
,
nor
without
her
overhear
Mr.
Weston
whisper
to
his
wife
,
"
He
have
ask
her
,
my

that
be
right

I
know
he
would

one
thing
only
be
want
to
make
the
prospect
of
the
ball
completely
satisfactory
to
Emma
 
its
be
fix
for
a
day
within
the
grant
term
of
Frank
Churchill
's
stay
in
Surry
;
for
,
in
spite
of
Mr.
Weston
's
confidence
,
she
could
not
think
it
so
very
impossible
that
the
Churchills
may
not
allow
their
nephew
to
remain
a
day
beyond
his
fortnight
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
judge
feasible
.
<EOS>
the
preparation
must
take
their
time
,
nothing
could
be
properly
ready
till
the
third
week
be
enter
on
,
and
for
a
few
day
they
must
be
plan
,
proceed
and
hope
in
uncertainty
 
at
the
risk
 
in
her
opinion
,
the
great
risk
,
of
its
be
all
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
Enscombe
however
be
gracious
,
gracious
in
fact
,
if
not
in
word
.
<EOS>
His
wish
of
stay
longer
evidently
do
not
please
;
but
it
be
not
oppose
.
<EOS>
all
be
safe
and
prosperous
;
and
as
the
removal
of
one
solicitude
generally
make
way
for
another
,
Emma
,
be
now
certain
of
her
ball
,
begin
to
adopt
as
the
next
vexation
Mr.
Knightley
's
provoke
indifference
about
it
.
<EOS>
either
because
he
do
not
dance
himself
,
or
because
the
plan
have
be
form
without
his
be
consult
,
he
seem
resolve
that
it
should
not
interest
him
,
determine
against
its
exciting
any
present
curiosity
,
or
afford
him
any
future
amusement
.
<EOS>
to
her
voluntary
communication
Emma
could
get
no
more
approve
reply
,
than
,
  
"
<EOS>
very
well
.
<EOS>
if
the
Westons
think
it
worth
while
to
be
at
all
this
trouble
for
a
few
hour
of
noisy
entertainment
,
I
have
nothing
to
say
against
it
,
but
that
they
shall
not
chuse
pleasure
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
I
must
be
there
;
I
could
not
refuse
;
and
I
will
keep
as
much
awake
as
I
can
;
but
I
would
rather
be
at
home
,
look
over
William
Larkins
's
week
's
account
;
much
rather
,
I
confess
.
 
<EOS>
pleasure
in
see
dancing
!
 
<EOS>
not
I
,
indeed
 
I
never
look
at
it
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
who
do
.
 
<EOS>
fine
dancing
,
I
believe
,
like
virtue
,
must
be
its
own
reward
.
<EOS>
those
who
be
stand
by
be
usually
think
of
something
very
different
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
Emma
feel
be
aim
at
her
;
and
it
make
her
quite
angry
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
in
compliment
to
Jane
Fairfax
however
that
he
be
so
indifferent
,
or
so
indignant
;
he
be
not
guide
by
_
her
_
feeling
in
reprobate
the
ball
,
for
_
<EOS>
she
_
enjoy
the
thought
of
it
to
an
extraordinary
degree
.
<EOS>
It
make
her
animate
 
<EOS>
open
hearted
 
<EOS>
she
voluntarily
say
;
    
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
I
hope
nothing
may
happen
to
prevent
the
ball
.
<EOS>
what
a
disappointment
it
would
be
!
<EOS>
I
do
look
forward
to
it
,
I
own
,
with
_
<EOS>
very
_
great
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
oblige
Jane
Fairfax
therefore
that
he
would
have
prefer
the
society
of
William
Larkins
.
<EOS>
no
!
 
<EOS>
she
be
more
and
more
convinced
that
Mrs.
Weston
be
quite
mistaken
in
that
surmise
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
deal
of
friendly
and
of
compassionate
attachment
on
his
side
 
but
no
love
.
  
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
there
be
soon
no
leisure
for
quarrel
with
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
two
day
of
joyful
security
be
immediately
follow
by
the
over
-
throw
of
every
thing
.
<EOS>
a
letter
arrive
from
Mr.
Churchill
to
urge
his
nephew
's
instant
return
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Churchill
be
unwell
 
far
too
unwell
to
do
without
him
;
she
have
be
in
a
very
suffering
state
(
so
say
her
husband
)
<EOS>
when
write
to
her
nephew
two
day
before
,
though
from
her
usual
unwillingness
to
give
pain
,
and
constant
habit
of
never
think
of
herself
,
she
have
not
mention
it
;
but
now
she
be
too
ill
to
trifle
,
and
must
entreat
him
to
set
off
for
Enscombe
without
delay
.
  
<EOS>
the
substance
of
this
letter
be
forward
to
Emma
,
in
a
note
from
Mrs.
Weston
,
instantly
.
<EOS>
as
to
his
going
,
it
be
inevitable
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
go
within
a
few
hour
,
though
without
feel
any
real
alarm
for
his
aunt
,
to
lessen
his
repugnance
.
<EOS>
He
know
her
illness
;
they
never
occur
but
for
her
own
convenience
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
add
,
"
that
he
could
only
allow
himself
time
to
hurry
to
Highbury
,
after
breakfast
,
and
take
leave
of
the
few
friend
there
whom
he
could
suppose
to
feel
any
interest
in
him
;
and
that
he
may
be
expect
at
Hartfield
very
soon
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
wretched
note
be
the
finale
of
Emma
's
breakfast
.
<EOS>
when
once
it
have
be
read
,
there
be
no
do
any
thing
,
but
lament
and
exclaim
.
<EOS>
the
loss
of
the
ball
 
<EOS>
the
loss
of
the
young
man
 
and
all
that
the
young
man
may
be
feel
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
too
wretched
!
 
<EOS>
such
a
delightful
evening
as
it
would
have
be
!
 
<EOS>
every
body
so
happy
!
<EOS>
and
she
and
her
partner
the
happy
!
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
it
would
be
so
,
"
be
the
only
consolation
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
's
feeling
be
quite
distinct
.
<EOS>
He
think
principally
of
Mrs.
Churchill
's
illness
,
and
want
to
know
how
she
be
treat
;
and
as
for
the
ball
,
it
be
shocking
to
have
dear
Emma
disappoint
;
but
they
would
all
be
safe
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
be
ready
for
her
visitor
some
time
before
he
appear
;
but
if
this
reflect
at
all
upon
his
impatience
,
his
sorrowful
look
and
total
want
of
spirit
when
he
do
come
may
redeem
him
.
<EOS>
He
feel
the
go
away
almost
too
much
to
speak
of
it
.
<EOS>
His
dejection
be
most
evident
.
<EOS>
He
sit
really
lose
in
thought
for
the
first
few
minute
;
and
when
rouse
himself
,
it
be
only
to
say
,
  
"
of
all
horrid
thing
,
leave
-
taking
be
the
bad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
will
come
again
,
"
say
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
this
will
not
be
your
only
visit
to
randall
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
ah
!
 
<EOS>
(
shake
his
head
)
 
<EOS>
the
uncertainty
of
when
I
may
be
able
to
return
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
try
for
it
with
a
zeal
!
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
the
object
of
all
my
thought
and
care
!
 
<EOS>
and
if
my
uncle
and
aunt
go
to
town
this
spring
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
afraid
 
they
do
not
stir
last
spring
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
it
be
a
custom
go
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Our
poor
ball
must
be
quite
give
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
ah
!
that
ball
!
 
<EOS>
why
do
we
wait
for
any
thing
?
 
<EOS>
why
not
seize
the
pleasure
at
once
?
 
<EOS>
how
often
be
happiness
destroy
by
preparation
,
foolish
preparation
!
 
<EOS>
You
tell
us
it
would
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
why
be
you
always
so
right
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
I
be
very
sorry
to
be
right
in
this
instance
.
<EOS>
I
would
much
rather
have
be
merry
than
wise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
can
come
again
,
we
be
still
to
have
our
ball
.
<EOS>
My
father
depend
on
it
.
<EOS>
do
not
forget
your
engagement
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
look
graciously
.
  
<EOS>
"
such
a
fortnight
as
it
have
be
!
"
he
continue
;
"
every
day
more
precious
and
more
delightful
than
the
day
before
!
 
<EOS>
every
day
make
me
less
fit
to
bear
any
other
place
.
<EOS>
happy
those
,
who
can
remain
at
Highbury
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
you
do
us
such
ample
justice
now
,
"
say
Emma
,
laugh
,
"
I
will
venture
to
ask
,
whether
you
do
not
come
a
little
doubtfully
at
first
?
<EOS>
do
not
we
rather
surpass
your
expectation
?
<EOS>
I
be
sure
we
do
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
do
not
much
expect
to
like
us
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
have
be
so
long
in
come
,
if
you
have
have
a
pleasant
idea
of
Highbury
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
laugh
rather
consciously
;
and
though
deny
the
sentiment
,
Emma
be
convince
that
it
have
be
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
must
be
off
this
very
morning
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
my
father
be
to
join
me
here
:
we
shall
walk
back
together
,
and
I
must
be
off
immediately
.
<EOS>
I
be
almost
afraid
that
every
moment
will
bring
him
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
five
minute
to
spare
even
for
your
friend
Miss
Fairfax
and
Miss
Bates
?
<EOS>
how
unlucky
!
<EOS>
Miss
Bates
's
powerful
,
argumentative
mind
may
have
strengthen
your
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
 
I
_
have
_
call
there
;
pass
the
door
,
I
think
it
better
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
right
thing
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
go
in
for
three
minute
,
and
be
detain
by
Miss
Bates
's
be
absent
.
<EOS>
She
be
out
;
and
I
feel
it
impossible
not
to
wait
till
she
come
in
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
woman
that
one
may
,
that
one
<EOS>
_
must
_
laugh
at
;
but
that
one
would
not
wish
to
slight
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
to
pay
my
visit
,
then
"
    
He
hesitate
,
get
up
,
walk
to
a
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
short
,
"
say
he
,
"
perhaps
,
Miss
Woodhouse
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
can
hardly
be
quite
without
suspicion
"
    
<EOS>
He
look
at
her
,
as
if
want
to
read
her
thought
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
know
what
to
say
.
<EOS>
It
seem
like
the
forerunner
of
something
absolutely
serious
,
which
she
do
not
wish
.
<EOS>
force
herself
to
speak
,
therefore
,
in
the
hope
of
put
it
by
,
she
calmly
say
,
  
"
You
be
quite
in
the
right
;
it
be
most
natural
to
pay
your
visit
,
then
"
    
He
be
silent
.
<EOS>
She
believe
he
be
look
at
her
;
probably
reflect
on
what
she
have
say
,
and
try
to
understand
the
manner
.
<EOS>
She
hear
him
sigh
.
<EOS>
It
be
natural
for
him
to
feel
that
he
have
_
cause
_
to
sigh
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
believe
her
to
be
encourage
him
.
<EOS>
a
few
awkward
moment
pass
,
and
he
sit
down
again
;
and
in
a
more
determined
manner
say
,
  
"
It
be
something
to
feel
that
all
the
rest
of
my
time
may
be
give
to
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
My
regard
for
Hartfield
be
most
warm
"
    
<EOS>
He
stopt
again
,
rise
again
,
and
seem
quite
embarrassed
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
more
in
love
with
her
than
Emma
have
suppose
;
and
who
can
say
how
it
may
have
end
,
if
his
father
have
not
make
his
appearance
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
soon
follow
;
and
the
necessity
of
exertion
make
him
compose
.
  
<EOS>
a
very
few
minute
more
,
however
,
complete
the
present
trial
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
,
always
alert
when
business
be
to
be
do
,
and
as
incapable
of
procrastinate
any
evil
that
be
inevitable
,
as
of
foresee
any
that
be
doubtful
,
say
,
"
It
be
time
to
go
;
"
and
the
young
man
,
though
he
may
and
do
sigh
,
could
not
but
agree
,
to
take
leave
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
hear
about
you
all
,
"
say
he
;
"
that
be
my
chief
consolation
.
<EOS>
I
shall
hear
of
every
thing
that
be
go
on
among
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
engage
Mrs.
Weston
to
correspond
with
me
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
so
kind
as
to
promise
it
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
the
blessing
of
a
female
correspondent
,
when
one
be
really
interested
in
the
absent
!
 
<EOS>
she
will
tell
me
every
thing
.
<EOS>
in
her
letter
I
shall
be
at
dear
Highbury
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
very
friendly
shake
of
the
hand
,
a
very
earnest
"
good
-
bye
<EOS>
,
"
close
the
speech
,
and
the
door
have
soon
shut
out
Frank
Churchill
.
<EOS>
Short
have
be
the
notice
 
short
their
meeting
;
he
be
go
;
and
Emma
feel
so
sorry
to
part
,
and
foresaw
so
great
a
loss
to
their
little
society
from
his
absence
as
to
begin
to
be
afraid
of
be
too
sorry
,
and
feel
it
too
much
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
sad
change
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
meet
almost
every
day
since
his
arrival
.
<EOS>
certainly
his
being
at
randall
have
give
great
spirit
to
the
last
two
week
 
indescribable
spirit
;
the
idea
,
the
expectation
of
see
him
which
every
morning
have
bring
,
the
assurance
of
his
attention
,
his
liveliness
,
his
manner
!
<EOS>
It
have
be
a
very
happy
fortnight
,
and
forlorn
must
be
the
sinking
from
it
into
the
common
course
of
Hartfield
day
.
<EOS>
to
complete
every
other
recommendation
,
he
have
_
<EOS>
almost
_
tell
her
that
he
love
her
.
<EOS>
what
strength
,
or
what
constancy
of
affection
he
may
be
subject
to
,
be
another
point
;
but
at
present
she
could
not
doubt
his
have
a
decidedly
warm
admiration
,
a
conscious
preference
of
herself
;
and
this
persuasion
,
join
to
all
the
rest
,
make
her
think
that
she
_
must
_
be
a
little
in
love
with
him
,
in
spite
of
every
previous
determination
against
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
must
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
sensation
of
listlessness
,
weariness
,
stupidity
,
this
disinclination
to
sit
down
and
employ
myself
,
this
feeling
of
every
thing
's
be
dull
and
insipid
about
the
house
!
  
<EOS>
I
must
be
in
love
;
I
should
be
the
oddest
creature
in
the
world
if
I
be
not
 
for
a
few
week
at
least
.
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
evil
to
some
be
always
good
to
other
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
many
fellow
-
mourner
for
the
ball
,
if
not
for
Frank
Churchill
;
but
Mr.
Knightley
will
be
happy
.
<EOS>
He
may
spend
the
evening
with
his
dear
William
Larkins
now
if
he
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
,
however
,
shew
no
triumphant
happiness
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
say
that
he
be
sorry
on
his
own
account
;
his
very
cheerful
look
would
have
contradict
him
if
he
have
;
but
he
say
,
and
very
steadily
,
that
he
be
sorry
for
the
disappointment
of
the
other
,
and
<EOS>
with
considerable
kindness
add
,
  
"
You
,
Emma
,
who
have
so
few
opportunity
of
dancing
,
you
be
really
out
of
luck
;
you
be
very
much
out
of
luck
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
some
day
before
she
see
Jane
Fairfax
,
to
judge
of
her
honest
regret
in
this
woeful
change
;
but
when
they
do
meet
,
her
composure
be
odious
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
particularly
unwell
,
however
,
suffer
from
headache
to
a
degree
,
which
make
her
aunt
declare
,
that
have
the
ball
take
place
,
she
do
not
think
Jane
could
have
attend
it
;
and
it
be
charity
to
impute
some
of
her
unbecoming
indifference
to
the
languor
of
ill
-
health
.
    
<EOS>
Emma
continue
to
entertain
no
doubt
of
her
be
in
love
.
<EOS>
Her
idea
only
vary
as
to
the
how
much
.
<EOS>
at
first
,
she
think
it
be
a
good
deal
;
and
afterwards
,
but
little
.
<EOS>
She
have
great
pleasure
in
hear
Frank
Churchill
talk
of
;
and
,
for
his
sake
,
great
pleasure
than
ever
in
see
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
;
she
be
very
often
think
of
him
,
and
quite
impatient
for
a
letter
,
that
she
may
know
how
he
be
,
how
be
his
spirit
,
how
be
his
aunt
,
and
what
be
the
chance
of
his
come
to
randall
again
this
spring
.
<EOS>
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
she
could
not
admit
herself
to
be
unhappy
,
nor
,
after
the
first
morning

pleasing

be

she
could
yet
imagine
him
to
have
fault
;

farther
,
though
think
of
him
so
much
,
and

as
she
sit

form
a
thousand
amusing
scheme
for
the
progress
and
close
of
their
attachment
,
fancy
interesting
dialogue
,

invent
elegant
letter

the
conclusion
of
every
imaginary
declaration
on
his
side
be
that
she
_
refuse
_

_
him
<EOS>

<EOS>
Their
affection
be
always
to
subside
into
friendship
.
<EOS>
every
thing
tender
and
charming
be
to
mark
their
parting
;
but
still
they
be
to
part
.
<EOS>
when
she
become
sensible
of
this
,
it
strike
her
that
she
could
not
be
very
much
in
love
;
for
in
spite
of
her
previous
and
fixed
determination
never
to
quit
her
father
,
never
to
marry
,
a
strong
attachment
certainly
must
produce
more
of
a
struggle
than
she
could
foresee
in
her
own
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
find
myself

any
use
of
the

_
sacrifice

say
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
in
not
one
of
all
my
clever
reply
,
my
delicate
negative
,
be
there
any
allusion
to
make
a
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
I
do
suspect
that
he
be
not
really
necessary
to
my
happiness
.
<EOS>
so
much
the
well
.
<EOS>
I
certainly
will
not
persuade
myself
to
feel
more
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
enough
in
love
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
sorry
to
be
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
she
be
equally
contented
with
her
view
of
his
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
He
_
be
undoubtedly
very
much
in
love
 
<EOS>
every
thing
denote
it
 
very
much
in
love
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
and
when
he
come
again
,
if
his
affection
continue
,
I
must
be
on
my
guard
not
to
encourage
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
most
inexcusable
to
do
otherwise
,
as
my
own
mind
be
quite
make
up
.
<EOS>
not
that
I
imagine
he
can
think
I
have
be
encourage
him
hitherto
.
<EOS>
no
,
if
he
have
believe
me
at
all
to
share
his
feeling
,
he
would
not
have
be
so
wretched
.
<EOS>
Could
he
have
think
himself
encourage
,
his
look
and
language
at
parting
would
have
be
different
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
however
,
I
must
be
on
my
guard
.
<EOS>
this
be
in
the
supposition
of
his
attachment
continue
what
it
now
be
;
but
I
do
not
know
that
I
expect
it
will
;
I
do
not
look
upon
him
to
be
quite
the
sort
of
man
 
I
do
not
altogether
build
upon
his
steadiness
or
constancy
.
 
<EOS>
His
feeling
be
warm
,
but
I
can
imagine
them
rather
changeable
.
 
<EOS>
every
consideration
of
the
subject
,
in
short
,
make
me
thankful
that
my
happiness
be
not
more
deeply
involved
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
do
very
well
again
after
a
little
while
 
and
then
,
it
will
be
a
good
thing
over
;
for
they
say
every
body
be
in
love
once
in
their
life
,
and
I
shall
have
be
let
off
easily
.

Emma
have
the
perusal
of

she
read
it
with
a
degree
of
pleasure

her
at
first
shake
her
head
over
her

think
she
have
undervalue

<EOS>
It
be
a
long

well

express
all

with
spirit

precision

<EOS>
no
suspicious
flourish

of
apology

concern

it
be
the
language
of
real
feeling
towards
Mrs.

the
transition
from
Highbury
to
Enscombe
,
the
contrast
between
the
place
in
some
of
the
first
blessing
of
social

just
enough

how
keenly

not

that

His

<EOS>
no

Harriet
undoubtedly

circumstance

it
would
be

I

I
must

I
know
the
danger

such
speculation

strange
thing
have
happen
;

when
we
cease

care
for

it
will
be
the

of
confirm
us

I

already
look
forward

pleasure

<EOS>
It
be
well
to
have
a
comfort

it
may
be
wise
to
let
the
fancy
touch

seldom

quarter

He

three

be
lately

<EOS>
with
Mr.

ball
in

at
least
,
there
have
be
a
great
deal
of
insensibility
to
other
thing
;
but
it
be
now
too
evident
that
she
have
not
attain
such
a
state
of
composure
as
could
stand
against
the
actual

Poor

in
a
flutter

spirit

require
all
the
reasoning

attention

every
kind
that
Emma
could
give

<EOS>
Emma
feel
that
she
could
not
do
too
much
for
her
,
that
Harriet
have
a
right
to
all
her
ingenuity
and
all
her
patience
;
but
it
be
heavy
work
to
be
for
ever
convincing
without
produce
any
effect

for
ever
agree
to

without

able

make
their
opinion

<EOS>
Harriet
listen
submissively
,
and
say
"
it
be
very
true
 
<EOS>
it
be
just
as
Miss
Woodhouse
describe
 
<EOS>
it
be
not
worth
while
to
think
about
them

she
would
not
think
about
them
any
longer

but
no
change
of
subject
could
avail

the
next
half

hour
see
her
as
anxious

restless
about

at

exert
yourself

but
though
devotion
may
be
interrupt

curiosity
could
not

satisfy
by
a
bride
in
a
pew

and
it
must
be
leave
for
the
visit
in
form

to
settle
whether
she

very
pretty

pretty

Emma
have
feeling

less

curiosity

propriety

to
make
her
resolve
on
not

last
to
pay
her
respect
;

she
make
a
point
of
Harriet

go
with
her

that
the
bad
of

business
may
be
go
through

soon

She
could
not
enter

such
vain
artifice
retreat
three
month
ago

up
her

without

a

charade

she
behave
very
well

be
only
rather
pale

silent

the
visit
be
of
course
short

there
be
so
much
embarrassment

on
no

Her
person
be
rather
good

her
face
not
unpretty
;

neither
feature

nor
air

nor
voice

nor
manner

be
elegant

<EOS>
emma
think
at

it
would
turn
out
so
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Mr.
Elton
,
his
manner
do
not
appear
 
<EOS>
but
no
,
she
would
not
permit
a
hasty
or
a
witty
word
from
herself
about
his
manner
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
awkward
ceremony
at
any
time
to
be
receive
wedding
visit
,
and
a
man
have
nee
be
all
grace
to
acquit
himself
well
through
it

<EOS>
the
woman
be
well
off
;
she
may
have
the
assistance
of
fine
clothe
,
and
the
privilege
of
bashfulness
,
but
the
man
have
only
his
own
good
sense
to
depend
on
;
and
when
she
consider
how
peculiarly
unlucky
poor
Mr.
Elton
be
in
be
in
the
same
room
at
once
with
the
woman
he
have
just
marry
,
the
woman
he
have
want
to
marry
,
and
the
woman
whom
he
have
be
expect
to
marry
,
she
must
allow
him
to
have
the
right
to
look
as
little
wise
,
and
to
be
as
much
affectedly
,
and
as
little
really
easy
as
could
be

<EOS>
"
well
,
Miss

Harriet

when

Miss

(
with
a
gentle

what
do
you

be
not

very

there

oh

yes
 
<EOS>
very
 
a
very
pleasing

oh

no

there

a
pretty

she

in

<EOS>
"
I
dare

return
Harriet

again

I
dare

she
be
very
much
attach
to
him

<EOS>
"
perhaps
she
may
;
but
it
be
not
every
man

fate
to
marry
the
woman
who
love
him
best

<EOS>
Miss
Hawkins
perhaps
want
a

think
this
the
good

she
be
likely

<EOS>
well

I

now
,
Miss

I
do
not

He
be
just
as
superior
as
ever

be
marry

you
know

it
be
quite
a
different

<EOS>
no

indeed
,
Miss
Woodhouse

you
need
not
be
afraid

I
can
sit
and
admire
him
now
without
any
great
misery

<EOS>
to
know
that

away

such
a
comfort

She

just

happy

He
call
her

Augusta

delightful

"
  
<EOS>
when
the
visit
be
return
,
Emma
make
up
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
could
then
see
more
and
judge
better
.
<EOS>
from
Harriet
's
happen
not
to
be
at
Hartfield
,
and
her
father
's
be
present
to
engage
Mr.
Elton
,
she
have
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
the
lady
's
conversation
to
herself
,
and
could
composedly
attend
to
her
;
and
the
quarter
of
an
hour
quite
convince
her
that
Mrs.
Elton
be
a
vain
woman
,
extremely
well
satisfied
with
herself
,
and
think
much
of
her
own
importance
;
that
she
mean
to
shine
and
be
very
superior
,
but
with
manner
which
have
be
form
in
a
bad
school
,
pert
and
familiar
;
that
all
her
notion
be
draw
from
one
set
of
people
,
and
one
style
of
living
;
that
if
not
foolish
she
be
ignorant
,
and
that
her
society
would
certainly
do
Mr.
Elton
<EOS>
no
good
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
would
have
be
a
well
match
.
<EOS>
if
not
wise
or
refined
herself
,
she
would
have
connect
him
with
those
who
be
;
but
Miss
Hawkins
,
it
may
be
fairly
suppose
from
her
easy
conceit
,
have
be
the
good
of
her
own
set
.
<EOS>
the
rich
brother
-
in
-
law
near
Bristol
be
the
pride
of
the
alliance
,
and
his
place
and
his
carriage
be
the
pride
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
very
first
subject
after
be
seat
be
Maple
Grove
,
"
<EOS>
My
brother
Mr.
Suckling
's
seat
;
"
 
a
comparison
of
Hartfield
to
Maple
Grove
.
<EOS>
the
ground
of
Hartfield
be
small
,
but
neat
and
pretty
;
and
the
house
be
modern
and
well
-
build
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Elton
seem
most
favourably
impress
by
the
size
of
the
room
,
the
entrance
,
and
all
that
she
could
see
or
imagine
.
"
<EOS>
very
like
Maple
Grove
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
She
be
quite
strike
by
the
likeness
!
 
<EOS>
that
room
be
the
very
shape
and
size
of
the
morning
-
room
at
Maple
Grove
;
her
sister
's
favourite
room
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
be
appeal
to
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
not
it
astonishingly
like
?
 
<EOS>
She
could
really
almost
fancy
herself
at
Maple
Grove
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
the
staircase
 
<EOS>
You
know
,
as
I
come
in
,
I
observe
how
very
like
the
staircase
be
;
place
exactly
in
the
same
part
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
really
could
not
help
exclaim
!
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
it
be
very
delightful
to
me
,
to
be
remind
of
a
place
I
be
so
extremely
partial
to
as
Maple
Grove
.
<EOS>
I
have
spend
so
many
happy
month
there
!
<EOS>
(
with
a
little
sigh
of
sentiment
)
.
<EOS>
a
charming
place
,
undoubtedly
.
<EOS>
every
body
who
see
it
be
strike
by
its
beauty
;
but
to
me
,
it
have
be
quite
a
home
.
<EOS>
whenever
you
be
transplant
,
like
me
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
you
will
understand
how
very
delightful
it
be
to
meet
with
any
thing
at
all
like
what
one
have
leave
behind
.
<EOS>
I
always
say
this
be
quite
one
of
the
evil
of
matrimony
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
make
as
slight
a
reply
as
she
could
;
but
it
be
fully
sufficient
for
Mrs.
Elton
,
who
only
want
to
be
talk
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
extremely
like
Maple
Grove
!
<EOS>
and
it
be
not
merely
the
house
 
<EOS>
the
ground
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
as
far
as
I
could
observe
,
be
strikingly
like
.
<EOS>
the
laurel
at
Maple
Grove
be
in
the
same
profusion
as
here
,
and
stand
very
much
in
the
same
way
 
just
across
the
lawn
;
and
I
have
a
glimpse
of
a
fine
large
tree
,
with
a
bench
round
it
,
which
put
me
so
exactly
in
mind
!
<EOS>
My
brother
and
sister
will
be
enchant
with
this
place
.
<EOS>
People
who
have
extensive
ground
<EOS>
themselves
be
always
pleased
with
any
thing
in
the
same
style
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
doubt
the
truth
of
this
sentiment
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
great
idea
that
people
who
have
extensive
ground
themselves
care
very
little
for
the
extensive
ground
of
any
body
else
;
but
it
be
not
worth
while
to
attack
an
error
so
double
-
dyed
,
and
therefore
only
say
in
reply
,
  
<EOS>
"
when
you
have
see
more
of
this
country
,
I
be
afraid
you
will
think
you
have
overrate
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
Surry
be
full
of
beauty
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
I
be
quite
aware
of
that
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
garden
of
England
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
Surry
be
the
garden
of
England
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
but
we
must
not
rest
our
claim
on
that
distinction
.
<EOS>
many
county
,
I
believe
,
be
call
the
garden
of
England
,
as
well
as
Surry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
fancy
not
,
"
reply
Mrs.
Elton
,
with
a
most
satisfied
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
hear
any
county
but
Surry
call
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
be
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
brother
and
sister
have
promise
us
a
visit
in
the
spring
,
or
summer
at
farth
,
"
continue
Mrs.
Elton
;
"
and
that
will
be
our
time
for
explore
.
<EOS>
while
they
be
with
us
,
we
shall
explore
a
great
deal
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
They
will
have
their
barouche
-
landau
,
of
course
,
which
hold
four
perfectly
;
and
therefore
,
without
say
any
thing
of
_
our
_
carriage
,
we
should
be
able
to
explore
the
different
beauty
extremely
well
.
<EOS>
They
would
hardly
come
in
their
chaise
,
I
think
,
at
that
season
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
when
the
time
draw
on
,
I
shall
decidedly
recommend
their
bring
the
barouche
-
landau
;
it
will
be
so
very
much
preferable
.
<EOS>
when
people
come
into
a
beautiful
country
of
this
sort
,
you
know
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
one
naturally
wish
them
to
see
as
much
as
possible
;
and
Mr.
Suckling
be
extremely
fond
of
explore
.
<EOS>
We
explore
to
King's
-
Weston
twice
last
summer
,
in
that
way
,
most
delightfully
,
just
after
their
first
have
the
barouche
-
landau
.
<EOS>
You
have
many
party
of
that
kind
here
,
I
suppose
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
every
summer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
not
immediately
here
.
<EOS>
We
be
rather
out
of
distance
of
the
very
striking
beauty
which
attract
the
sort
of
party
you
speak
of
;
and
we
be
a
very
quiet
set
of
people
,
I
believe
;
more
disposed
to
stay
at
home
than
engage
in
scheme
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
like
stay
at
home
for
real
comfort
.
<EOS>
nobody
can
be
more
devoted
to
home
than
I
be
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
a
proverb
for
it
at
Maple
Grove
.
<EOS>
many
a
time
have
Selina
say
,
when
she
have
be
go
to
Bristol
,
"
I
really
can
not
get
this
girl
to
move
from
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
absolutely
must
go
in
by
myself
,
though
I
hate
be
stick
up
in
the
barouche
-
landau
without
a
companion
;
but
Augusta
,
I
believe
,
with
her
own
good
-
will
,
would
never
stir
beyond
the
park
paling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
many
a
time
have
she
say
so
;
and
yet
I
be
no
advocate
for
entire
seclusion
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
on
the
contrary
,
when
people
shut
themselves
up
entirely
from
society
,
it
be
a
very
bad
thing
;
and
that
it
be
much
more
advisable
to
mix
in
the
world
in
a
proper
degree
,
without
live
in
it
either
too
much
or
too
little
.
<EOS>
I
perfectly
understand
your
situation
,
however
,
Miss
Woodhouse
 
<EOS>
(
look
towards
Mr.
Woodhouse
)
,
Your
father
's
state
of
health
must
be
a
great
drawback
.
<EOS>
why
do
not
he
try
Bath
?
 
<EOS>
indeed
he
should
.
<EOS>
let
me
recommend
Bath
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
I
have
no
doubt
of
its
do
Mr.
Woodhouse
good
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
try
it
more
than
once
,
formerly
;
but
without
receive
any
benefit
;
and
Mr.
Perry
,
whose
name
,
I
dare
say
,
be
not
unknown
to
you
,
do
not
conceive
it
would
be
at
all
more
likely
to
be
useful
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
that
be
a
great
pity
;
for
I
assure
you
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
where
the
water
do
agree
,
it
be
quite
wonderful
the
relief
they
give
.
<EOS>
in
my
Bath
life
,
I
have
see
such
instance
of
it
!
<EOS>
and
it
be
so
cheerful
a
place
,
that
it
could
not
fail
of
be
of
use
to
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
spirit
,
which
,
I
understand
,
be
sometimes
much
depressed
.
<EOS>
and
as
to
its
recommendation
to
_
<EOS>
you
_
,
<EOS>
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
need
not
take
much
pain
to
dwell
on
them
.
<EOS>
the
advantage
of
Bath
to
the
young
be
pretty
generally
understand
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
charming
introduction
for
you
,
who
have
live
so
seclude
a
life
;
and
I
could
immediately
secure
you
some
of
the
good
society
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
a
line
from
me
would
bring
you
a
little
host
of
acquaintance
;
and
my
particular
friend
,
Mrs.
Partridge
,
the
lady
I
have
always
reside
with
when
in
Bath
,
would
be
most
happy
to
shew
you
any
attention
,
and
would
be
the
very
person
for
you
to
go
into
public
with
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
as
much
as
Emma
could
bear
,
without
be
impolite
.
<EOS>
the
idea
of
her
be
indebte
to
Mrs.
Elton
for
what
be
call
an
_
introduction
_
 
of
her
go
into
public
under
the
auspex
of
a
friend
of
Mrs.
Elton
's
 
probably
some
vulgar
,
dash
widow
,
who
,
with
the
help
of
a
boarder
,
just
make
a
shift
to
live
!
 
<EOS>
the
dignity
of
Miss
Woodhouse
,
of
Hartfield
,
be
sink
indeed
!
  
<EOS>
She
restrain
herself
,
however
,
from
any
of
the
reproofs
she
could
have
give
,
and
only
thank
Mrs.
Elton
coolly
;
"
but
their
go
to
Bath
be
quite
out
of
the
question
;
and
she
be
not
perfectly
convince
that
the
place
may
suit
her
better
than
her
father
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
to
prevent
farther
outrage
and
indignation
,
change
the
subject
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
ask
whether
you
be
musical
,
Mrs.
Elton
.
<EOS>
upon
these
occasion
,
a
lady
's
character
generally
precede
her
;
and
Highbury
have
long
know
that
you
be
a
superior
performer
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
oh
!
no
,
indeed
;
I
must
protest
against
any
such
idea
.
<EOS>
a
superior
performer
!
 
<EOS>
very
far
from
it
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
consider
from
how
partial
a
quarter
your
information
come

<EOS>
I
be
doatingly
fond
of
music
 
passionately
fond
;
 
and
my
friend
say
I
be
not
entirely
devoid
of
taste
;
but
as
to
any
thing
else
,
upon
my
honour
my
performance
be
_
mediocre
_
to
the
last
degree
.
<EOS>
You
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
I
well
know
,
play
delightfully
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
it
have
be
the
great
satisfaction
,
comfort
,
and
delight
to
me
,
to
hear
what
a
musical
society
I
be
get
into
.
<EOS>
I
absolutely
can
not
do
without
music
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
necessary
of
life
to
me
;
and
have
always
be
use
to
a
very
musical
society
,
both
at
Maple
Grove
and
in
Bath
,
it
would
have
be
a
most
serious
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
I
honestly
say
as
much
to
Mr.
E.
when
he
be
speak
of
my
future
home
,
and
express
his
fear
lest
the
retirement
of
it
should
be
disagreeable
;
and
the
inferiority
of
the
house
too
 
know
what
I
have
be
accustom
to
 
of
course
<EOS>
he
be
not
wholly
without
apprehension
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
speak
of
it
in
that
way
,
I
honestly
say
that
_
the
_
_
world
<EOS>
_
I
could
give
up
 
party
,
ball
,
play
 
for
I
have
no
fear
of
retirement
.
<EOS>
bless
with
so
many
resource
within
myself
,
the
world
be
not
necessary
to
_
me
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
I
could
do
very
well
without
it
.
<EOS>
to
those
who
have
no
resource
it
be
a
different
thing
;
but
my
resource
make
me
quite
independent
.
<EOS>
and
as
to
smaller
-
sized
room
than
I
have
be
use
to
,
I
really
could
not
give
it
a
thought
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
be
perfectly
equal
to
any
sacrifice
of
that
description
.
<EOS>
certainly
I
have
be
accustom
to
every
luxury
at
Maple
Grove
;
but
I
do
assure
him
that
two
carriage
be
not
necessary
to
my
happiness
,
nor
be
spacious
apartment
.
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
say
I
,
"
to
be
quite
honest
,
I
do
not
think
I
can
live
without
something
of
a
musical
society
.
<EOS>
I
condition
for
nothing
else
;
but
without
music
,
life
would
be
a
blank
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
We
can
not
suppose
,
"
say
Emma
,
smile
,
"
that
Mr.
Elton
would
hesitate
to
assure
you
of
there
be
a
_
<EOS>
very
_
musical
society
in
Highbury
;
and
I
hope
you
will
not
find
he
have
outsteppe
the
truth
more
than
may
be
pardon
,
in
consideration
of
the
motive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
,
I
have
no
doubt
at
all
on
that
head
.
<EOS>
I
be
delighted
to
find
myself
in
such
a
circle
.
<EOS>
I
hope
we
shall
have
many
sweet
little
concert
together
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
you
and
I
must
establish
a
musical
club
,
and
have
regular
weekly
meeting
at
your
house
,
or
ours
.
<EOS>
Will
not
it
be
a
good
plan
?
<EOS>
if
_
<EOS>
we
_
exert
ourselves
<EOS>
,
I
think
we
shall
not
be
long
in
want
of
ally
.
<EOS>
something
of
that
nature
would
be
particularly
desirable
for
_
me
_
,
as
an
inducement
to
keep
me
in
practice
;
for
married
woman
,
you
know
 
there
be
a
sad
story
against
them
,
in
general
.
<EOS>
They
be
but
too
apt
to
give
up
music
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
,
who
be
so
extremely
fond
of
it
 
there
can
be
no
danger
,
surely
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
hope
not
;
but
really
when
I
look
around
among
my
acquaintance
,
I
tremble
.
<EOS>
Selina
have
entirely
give
up
music
 
never
touch
the
instrument
 
though
she
play
sweetly
.
<EOS>
and
the
same
may
be
say
of
Mrs.
Jeffereys
 
Clara
Partridge
,
that
be
 
and
of
the
two
Milmans
,
now
Mrs.
Bird
and
Mrs.
James
Cooper
;
and
of
more
than
I
can
enumerate
.
<EOS>
upon
my
word
it
be
enough
to
put
one
in
a
fright
.
<EOS>
I
use
to
be
quite
angry
with
Selina
;
but
really
I
begin
now
to
comprehend
that
a
married
woman
have
many
thing
to
call
her
attention
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
be
half
an
hour
this
morning
shut
up
with
my
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
every
thing
of
that
kind
,
"
say
Emma
,
"
will
soon
be
in
so
regular
a
train
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Mrs.
Elton
,
laugh
,
"
we
shall
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
,
find
her
so
determined
upon
neglect
her
music
,
have
nothing
more
to
say
;
and
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
Mrs.
Elton
choose
another
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
be
call
at
randall

she
,
"
and
find
them
both
at
home
;
and
very
pleasant
people
they
seem
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
like
them
extremely
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
seem
an
excellent
creature
 
quite
a
first

rate
favourite
with
me
already

I
assure
you

appear
so
truly
good

there
be
something
so
motherly
and
kind

hearted
about
her

that
it
win
upon
one
directly

<EOS>
She
be
your
governess

I
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
be
almost
too
much
astonished
to
answer
;
but
Mrs.
Elton
hardly
wait
for
the
affirmative
before
she
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
understand
as
much

I
be
rather
astonished

the
gentlewoman

always

good

Their

simplicity

would
make
them
the
safe
model

any
young

there

<EOS>
Emma

quite
at
a
loss

some
old
acquaintance

how
could
she
possibly
guess

"
Knightley

Mrs.

for
,
not

within
when

call
the
other

I
have
never

him
before

of
course
,
as
so
particular
a
friend
of
Mr.

I
have
a
great
curiosity
.
<EOS>
"
My
friend
Knightley
'
have
be
so
often
mention
,
that
I
be
really
impatient
to
see
him
;

I
must
do
my
caro
sposo
the
justice
to
say
that
he

not
be
ashamed
of
his
friend

Knightley
be
quite
the
gentleman

I
like
him
very
much

decidedly

I
think

a
very
gentleman

like
man

"
  
<EOS>
happily
,
it
be
now
time
to
be
go
.
<EOS>
They
be
off
;

Emma
could
breathe
.
  
<EOS>
"
insufferable
woman
!

"
be
her
immediate
exclamation

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
bad
than
I
have
suppose

absolutely
insufferable
!
<EOS>
Knightley
!

I
could
not
have
believe
it

<EOS>
Knightley
!
 
<EOS>
never
see
him
in
her
life
before
,
and
call
him
Knightley
!
 
and
discover
that
he
be
a
gentleman
!
<EOS>
a
little
upstart
,
vulgar
being
,
with
her
Mr.
E.
,
and
her
_
caro
_
<EOS>
_
sposo
_
,
and
her
resource
,
and
all
her
air
of
pert
pretension
and
underbred
finery
.
<EOS>
actually
to
discover
that
Mr.
Knightley
be
a
gentleman
!
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
he
will
return
the
compliment
,
and
discover
her
to
be
a
lady
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
believe
it
!
<EOS>
and
to
propose
that
she
and
I
should
unite
to
form
a
musical
club
!
<EOS>
one
would
fancy
we
be
bosom
friend
!
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Weston
!
 
<EOS>
astonish
that
the
person
who
have
bring
me
up
should
be
a
gentlewoman

<EOS>
bad
and
bad
.
<EOS>
I
never
meet
with
her
equal

<EOS>
much
beyond
my
hope

<EOS>
Harriet
be
disgrace
by
any
comparison

<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
what
would
Frank
Churchill
say
to
her
,
if
he
be
here
?
<EOS>
how
angry
and
how
divert
he
would
be
!
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
there
I
be
 
thinking
of
him
directly
.
<EOS>
always
the
first
person
to
be
think
of
!
<EOS>
how
I
catch
myself
out
!
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
come
as
regularly
into
my
mind
!
"
    
<EOS>
all
this
run
so
glibly
through
her
thought
,
that
by
the
time
her
father
have
arrange
himself
,
after
the
bustle
of
the
elton
'
departure
,
and
be
ready
to
speak
,
she
be
very
tolerably
capable
of
attend
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear
,
"
he
deliberately
begin
,
"
consider
we
never
see
her
before
,
she
seem
a
very
pretty
sort
of
young
lady
;
and
I
dare
say
she
be
very
much
pleased
with
you
.
<EOS>
She
speak
a
little
too
quick
.
<EOS>
a
little
quickness
of
voice
there
be
which
rather
hurt
the
ear
.
<EOS>
but
I
believe
I
be
nice
;
I
do
not
like
strange
voice
;
and
nobody
speak
like
you
and
poor
Miss
Taylor
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
seem
a
very
obliging
,
pretty
-
behave
young
lady
,
and
no
doubt
will
make
him
a
very
good
wife

<EOS>
though
I
think
he
have
well
not
have
marry

I
make
the
good
excuse
I
could
for
not
have
be
able
to
wait
on
him

Mrs.

happy
occasion

I
say
that
I

I

in

I

no

by
any
subsequent
discovery

to
retract
her
ill
opinion
of
Mrs.

Her
observation
have
be
pretty
correct

<EOS>
such
as
Mrs.

appear

her

this
second
interview

such
she
appear
whenever
they
meet
again

self

important
,
presuming
,
familiar
,
ignorant
,
and
ill
-
breed

<EOS>
She
have
a
little
beauty
and
a
little
accomplishment
,
but
so
little
judgment
that
she
think
herself
come
with
superior
knowledge
of
the
world
,
to
enliven
and
improve
a
country
neighbourhood
;
and
conceive
Miss
Hawkins
to
have
hold
such
a
place
in
society
as
Mrs.
Elton
's
consequence
only
could
surpass
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
reason
to
suppose
Mr.
Elton
think
at
all
differently
from
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
seem
not
merely
happy
with
her
,
but
proud
.

He
have
the
air
of
congratulate
himself
on
have
bring
such
a
woman
to
Highbury
,
as
not
even
Miss
Woodhouse
could
equal
;
and
the
great
part
of
her
new
acquaintance
,
dispose
to
commend
,
or
not
in
the
habit
of
judge
,
follow
the
lead
of
Miss
Bates
's
good

or
take
it
for
grant
that
the
bride
must
be
as
clever
and
as
agreeable
as
she
profess
herself
,
be
very
well
satisfied
;
so
that
Mrs.
Elton
's
praise
pass
from
one
mouth
to
another
as
it
ought
to
do

unimpede
by
Miss

very

<EOS>
in
one
respect
Mrs.

grow
even
bad
than
she
have
appear
at
first
.
<EOS>
Her
feeling
alter
towards
Emma
.
 
<EOS>
offend
,
probably
,
by
the
little
encouragement
which
her
proposal
of
intimacy
meet
with
<EOS>
,
she
draw
back
in
her
turn
and
gradually
become
much
more
cold
and
distant
;
and
though
the
effect
be
agreeable
,
the
ill
-
will
which
produce
it
be
necessarily
increase
Emma
's
dislike
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
,
too
 
and
Mr.
Elton
's
,
be
unpleasant
towards
Harriet
.
<EOS>
They
be
sneer
and
negligent
.
<EOS>
Emma
hope
it
must
rapidly
work
Harriet
's
cure

but
the
sensation
which
could
prompt
such
behaviour
sink
them
both
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
doubt
that
poor
Harriet
's
attachment
have
be
an
offering
to
conjugal
unreserve
,
and
her
own
share
in
the
story
,
under
a
colouring
the
least
favourable
to
her
and
the
most
soothing
to
him
,
have
in
all
likelihood
be
give
also
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
of
course
,
the
object
of
their
joint
dislike

<EOS>
when
they
have
nothing
else
to
say
,
it
must
be
always
easy
to
begin
abuse
Miss
Woodhouse
;
and
the
enmity
which
they
dare
not
shew
in
open
disrespect
to
her
,
find
a
broad
vent
in
contemptuous
treatment
of
Harriet

<EOS>
Mrs.
Elton
take
a
great
fancy
to
Jane
Fairfax
;
and
from
the
first
.
<EOS>
not
merely
when
a
state
of
warfare
with
one
young
lady
may
be
suppose
to
recommend
the
other
,
but
from
the
very
first
;
and
she
be
not
satisfied
with
express
a
natural
and
reasonable
admiration
 
but
without
solicitation
,
or
plea
,
or
privilege
,
she
must
be
want
to
assist
and
befriend
her
.
 
<EOS>
before
Emma
have
forfeit
her
confidence
,
and
about
the
third
time
of
their
meeting
,
she
hear
all
Mrs.

's
knight

on
the
subject

<EOS>
"
Jane
Fairfax
be
absolutely
charming
,
Miss
Woodhouse
.
 
<EOS>
I
quite
rave
about
Jane
Fairfax
.
 
<EOS>
a
sweet
,
interesting
creature
.
<EOS>
so
mild
and
ladylike
 
and
with
such
talent
!
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
<EOS>
I
think
she
have
very
extraordinary
talent
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
scruple
to
say
that
she
play
extremely
well
.
<EOS>
I
know
enough
of
music
to
speak
decidedly
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
she
be
absolutely
charming
!
<EOS>
You
will
laugh
at
my
warmth
 
but
,
upon
my
word
,
I
talk
of
nothing
but
Jane
Fairfax
.
 
<EOS>
and
her
situation
be
so
calculated
to
affect
one
!
 
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
we
must
exert
ourselves
and
endeavour
to
do
something
for
her
.
<EOS>
We
must
bring
her
forward
.
<EOS>
such
talent
as
her
must
not
be
suffer
to
remain
unknown
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
have
hear
those
charming
line
of
the
poet
,
  
<EOS>
"
full
many

flower

bear
to
blush
unseen

"
and
waste
its
fragrance
on
the
desert
air

"
  
<EOS>
We
must
not
allow
them
to
be
verify
in
sweet
Jane
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
think
there
be
any
danger
of
it
,
"
be
Emma
's
calm
answer
 
"
and
when
you
be
better
acquaint
with
Miss
Fairfax
's
situation
and
understand
what
her
home
have
be
,
with
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
,
I
have
no
idea
that
you
will
suppose
her
talent
can
be
unknown
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
but
dear
Miss
Woodhouse
,
she
be
now
in
such
retirement
,
such
obscurity
,
so
throw
away
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
advantage
she
may
have
enjoy
with
the
campbell
be
so
palpably
at
an
end
!
<EOS>
and
I
think
she
feel
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
she
do
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
timid
and
silent
.
<EOS>
one
can
see
that
she
feel
the
want
of
encouragement
.
<EOS>
I
like
her
the
well
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
must
confess
it
be
a
recommendation
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
great
advocate
for
timidity
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
sure
one
do
not
often
meet
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
those
who
be
at
all
inferior
,
it
be
extremely
prepossessing
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
Jane
Fairfax
be
a
very
delightful
character
,
and
interest
me
more
than
I
can
express
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
appear
to
feel
a
great
deal
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
aware
how
you
or
any
of
Miss
Fairfax
's
acquaintance
here
,
any
of
those
who
have
know
her
long
than
yourself

shew
her
any
other
attention
than
"
    
"
My
dear
Miss
Woodhouse
,
a
vast
deal
may
be
do
by
those
who
dare
to
act
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
need
not
be
afraid
.
<EOS>
if
_
we
_
set
the
example
,
many
will
follow
it
as
far
as
they
can
;
though
all
have
not
our
situation
.
<EOS>
_
We
_
have
carriage
to
fetch
and
convey
her
home
,
and
<EOS>
_
we
_
live
in
a
style
which
could
not
make
the
addition
of
Jane
Fairfax
,
<EOS>
at
any
time
,
the
least
inconvenient
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
extremely
displeased
if
Wright
be
to
send
us
up
such
a
dinner
,
as
could
make
me
regret
have
ask
_
more
_
than
Jane
Fairfax
to
partake
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
idea
of
that
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
likely
that
I
_
<EOS>
should
_
,
consider
what
I
have
be
use
to
.
<EOS>
My
great
danger
,
perhaps
,
in
housekeeping
,
may
be
quite
the
other
way
,
in
do
too
much
,
and
be
too
careless
of
expense
.
<EOS>
Maple
Grove
will
probably
be
my
model
more
than
it
ought
to
be
 
for
we
do
not
at
all
affect
to
equal
my
brother
,
Mr.
Suckling
,
in
income
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
my
resolution
be
take
as
to
notice
Jane
Fairfax
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
certainly
have
her
very
often
at
my
house
,
shall
introduce
her
wherever
I
can
,
shall
have
musical
party
to
draw
out
her
talent
,
and
shall
be
constantly
on
the
watch
for
an
eligible
situation
.
<EOS>
My
acquaintance
be
so
very
extensive
,
that
I
have
little
doubt
of
hearing
of
something
to
suit
her
shortly
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
introduce
her
,
of
course
,
very
particularly
to
my
brother
and
sister
when
they
come
to
us
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
they
will
like
her
extremely
;
and
when
she
get
a
little
acquaint
with
them
,
her
fear
will
completely
wear
off
,
for
there
really
be
nothing
in
the
manner
of
either
<EOS>
but
what
be
highly
conciliating
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
have
her
very
often
indeed
while
they
be
with
me
,
and
I
dare
say
we
shall
sometimes
find
a
seat
for
her
in
the
barouche

landau
in
some
of
our
explore

only
surprize

this
apology

must

very
tiresome

must
consider

take
into

such
a

You

scold
me

much

making

for
me
to
presume
to
take
such
a
liberty

You

I
never

I
assure
you

<EOS>
and
soon
afterwards
,
"
Jane
Fairfax
be
a
very
charming
young
woman
 
but
not
even
Jane
Fairfax
be
perfect
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
fault

She
have
not
the
open
temper

a

wish
for

<EOS>
Emma
could
not

rejoice
to
hear
that

have
a
fault

"
<EOS>
well

she

<EOS>
you
soon
silence
Mr.
Cole

I
suppose

"
<EOS>
yes

very
soon

He
give
me
a
quiet
hint
;
I
tell
him
he
be
mistaken
;
he
ask
my
pardon
and
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
Cole
do
not
want
to
be
wise
or
witty
than
his
neighbour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
that
respect
how
unlike
dear
Mrs.
Elton
,
who
want
to
be
wise
and
witty
than
all
the
world
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
she
speak
of
the
Coles
 
<EOS>
what
she
call
them
!
<EOS>
how
can
she
find
any
appellation
for
them
,
deep
enough
in
familiar
vulgarity
?
<EOS>
She
call
you
,
Knightley
 
what
can
she
do
for
Mr.
Cole
?
<EOS>
and
so
I
be
not
to
be
surprize
that
Jane
Fairfax
accept
her
civility
and
consent
to
be
with
her
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
,
your
argument
weigh
most
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
much
more
readily
enter
into
the
temptation
of
get
away
from
Miss
Bates
,
than
I
can
believe
in
the
triumph
of
Miss
Fairfax
's
mind
over
Mrs.
Elton
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
faith
in
Mrs.
Elton
's
acknowledge
herself
the
inferior
in
thought
,
word
,
or
deed
;
or
in
her
be
under
any
restraint
beyond
her
own
scanty
rule
of
good
-
breeding
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
imagine
that
she
will
not
be
continually
insult
her
visitor
with
praise
,
encouragement
,
and
offer
of
service
;
that
she
will
not
be
continually
detail
her
magnificent
intention
,
from
the
procuring
her
<EOS>
a
permanent
situation
to
the
include
her
in

delightful

party

be
to

"
  
"
Jane
Fairfax
have
feel
,
"
say
Mr.
Knightley
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
accuse
her
of
want
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
Her
sensibility
,
I
suspect
,
be
strong
 
and
her
temper
excellent
in
its
power
of
forbearance
,
patience
,
self

control
;
but
it
want
openness

<EOS>
She
be
reserve

more
reserved

I

,
than
she
use

I
love
an
open

no

I

with

<EOS>
no
invitation
come
amiss
to
her
.
<EOS>
Her
Bath
habit
make
evening
-
party
perfectly
natural
to
her

and
Maple
Grove
have
give
her
a
taste
for
dinner
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
little
shocked
at
the
want
of
two
drawing
room
,
at
the
poor
attempt
at
rout
-
cake
,
and
there
be
no
ice
in
the
Highbury
card
-
party
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bates
,
Mrs.
Perry
,
Mrs.
Goddard
and
other
,
be
a
good
deal
behind
-
hand
in
knowledge
of
the
world
,
but
she
would
soon
shew
them
how
every
thing
ought
to
be
arrange
.
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
the
spring
she
must
return
their
civility
by
one
very
superior
party
 
in
which
her
card
-
table
should
be
set
out
with
their
separate
candle
and
unbroken
pack
in
the
true
style
 
and
more
waiter
engage
for
the
evening
than
their
own
establishment
could
furnish
,
to
carry
round
the
refreshment
at
exactly
the
proper
hour
,
and
in
the
proper
order
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
could
not
be
satisfied
without
a
dinner
at
Hartfield
for
the
elton
.
<EOS>
They
must
not
do
less
than
other
,
or
she
should
be
expose
to
odious
suspicion
,
and
imagine
capable
of
pitiful
resentment
.
<EOS>
a
dinner
there
must
be
.
<EOS>
after
Emma
have
talk
about
it
for
ten
minute
,
Mr.
Woodhouse
feel
no
unwillingness
,
and
only
make
the
usual
stipulation
of
not
sit
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
himself
,
with
the
usual
regular
difficulty
of
decide
who
should
do
it
for
him

<EOS>
the
person
to
be
invite
,
require
little
thought
.
<EOS>
besides
the
Eltons
,
it
must
be
the
Westons
and
Mr.
Knightley
;
so
far
it
be
all
of
course
 
and
it
be
hardly
less
inevitable
that
poor
little
Harriet
must
be
ask
to
make
the
eighth
:
 
but
this
invitation
be
not
give
with
equal
satisfaction
,
and
on
many
account
Emma
be
particularly
please
by
<EOS>
Harriet
's
beg
to
be
allow
to
decline
it
.
<EOS>
"
She
would
rather
not

in
his
company
more
than
she
could

<EOS>
She
be
not

quite
able
to
see
him
and
his
charming
happy
wife
together
,
without
feel
uncomfortable
.

if
Miss
Woodhouse
would
not
be
displeased
,
she
would
rather
stay
at
home

"
It
be
precisely
what
Emma
would
have
wish
,
have
she
deem
it
possible
enough
for
wish
.
<EOS>
She
be
delighted
with
the
fortitude
of
her
little
friend
 
for
fortitude
<EOS>
she
know
it
be
in
her
to
give
up
be
in
company
and
stay
at
home
;
and
she
could
now
invite
the
very
person
whom
she
really
want
to
make
the
eighth
,
Jane
Fairfax
.
  
<EOS>
since
her
last
conversation
with
Mrs.
Weston
and
Mr.
Knightley
,
she
be
more
conscience
-
stricken
about
Jane
Fairfax
than
she
have
often
be
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
's
word
dwelt
with
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
say
that
Jane
Fairfax
receive
attention
from
Mrs.
Elton
which
nobody
else
pay
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
very
true
,
"
say
she
,
"
at
least
as
far
as
relate
to
me
,
which
be
all
that
be
mean
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
very
shameful
.
 
<EOS>
of
the
same
age
 
and
always
know
her
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
be
more
her
friend
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
never
like
me
now
.
<EOS>
I
have
neglect
her
too
long
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
shew
her
great
attention
than
I
have
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
every
invitation
be
successful
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
disengaged
and
all
happy
.
 
<EOS>
the
preparatory
interest
of
this
dinner
,
however
,
be
not
yet
over
.
<EOS>
a
circumstance
rather
unlucky
occur
.
<EOS>
the
two
eld
little
knightley
be
engage
to
pay
their
grandpapa
and
aunt
a
visit
of
some
week
in
the
spring
,
and
their
papa
now
propose
bring
them
,
and
stay
one
whole
day
at
Hartfield
 
which
one
day
would
be
the
very
day
of
this
party
.
 
<EOS>
His
professional
engagement
do
not
allow
of
his
be
put
off
,
but
both
father
and
daughter
be
disturb
by
its
happening
so
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
consider
eight
person
at
dinner
together
as
the
utmost
that
his
nerve
could
bear
 
and
here
would
be
a
ninth
 
and
Emma
apprehend
that
it
would
be
a
ninth
very
much
out
of
humour
at
not
be
able
to
come
even
to
Hartfield
for
forty
-
eight
hour
without
fall
in
with
a
dinner
-
party
.
  
<EOS>
She
comfort
her
father
better
than
she
could
comfort
herself
,
by
represent
that
though
he
certainly
would
make
them
nine
,
yet
he
always
say
so
little
,
that
the
increase
of
noise
would
be
very
immaterial
.
<EOS>
She
think
it
in
reality
a
sad
exchange
for
herself
,
to
have
him
with
his
grave
look
and
reluctant
conversation
oppose
to
her
instead
of
his
brother
.
  
<EOS>
the
event
be
more
favourable
to
Mr.
Woodhouse
than
to
Emma
.
<EOS>
John
Knightley
come
;
but
Mr.
Weston
be
unexpectedly
summon
to
town
and
must
be
absent
on
the
very
day
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
able
to
join
them
in
the
evening
,
but
certainly
not
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
be
quite
at
ease
;
and
the
see
him
so
,
with
the
arrival
of
the
little
boy
and
the
philosophic
composure
of
her
brother
on
hear
his
fate
,
remove
the
chief
of
even
Emma
's
vexation
.
  
<EOS>
the
day
come
,
the
party
be
punctually
assemble
,
and
Mr.
John
Knightley
seem
early
to
devote
himself
to
the
business
of
be
agreeable
.
<EOS>
instead
of
draw
his
brother
off
to
a
window
while
they
wait
for
dinner
,
he
be
talk
to
Miss
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Elton
,
as
elegant
as
lace
and
pearl
could
make
her
,
he
look
at
in
silence
 
want
only
to
observe
enough
for
Isabella
's
information
 
but
<EOS>
Miss
Fairfax
be
an
old
acquaintance
and
a
quiet
girl
,
and
he
could
talk
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
meet
her
before
breakfast
as
he
be
return
from
a
walk
with
his
little
boy
,
when
it
have
be
just
begin
to
rain
.
<EOS>
It
be
natural
to
have
some
civil
hope
on
the
subject
,
and
he
say
,
  
"
I
hope
you
do
not
venture
far
,
Miss
Fairfax
,
this
morning
,
or
I
be
sure
you
must
have
be
wet
.
 
<EOS>
We
scarcely
get
home
in
time
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
turn
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
go
only
to
the
post
-
office
,
"
say
she
,
"
and
reach
home
before
the
rain
be
much
.
<EOS>
It
be
my
daily
errand
.
<EOS>
I
always
fetch
the
letter
when
I
be
here
.
<EOS>
It
save
trouble
,
and
be
a
something
to
get
me
out
.

a
walk
before
breakfast
do
me
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
a
walk
in
the
rain
,
I
should
imagine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
<EOS>
but
it
do
not
absolutely
rain
when
I
set
out
.

<EOS>
Mr.
John
Knightley
smile
,
and
reply
,
  
"
<EOS>
that
be
to
say
,
you
choose
to
have
your
walk
,
for
you
<EOS>
be
not
six
yard
from
your
own
door
when
I
have
the
pleasure
of
meet
you
;
and
Henry
and
John
have
see
more
drop
than
they
could
count
long
before

<EOS>
the
post
-
office
have
a
great
charm
at
one
period
of
our
life
.
<EOS>
when
you
have
live
to
my
age
,
you
will
begin
to
think
letter
be
never
worth
go
through
the
rain
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
blush
,
and
then
this
answer
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
not
hope
to
be
ever
situate
as
you
be
,
in
the
midst
of
every
dear
connexion
,
and
therefore
I
can
not
expect
that
simply
grow
old
should
make
me
indifferent
about
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indifferent
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
no
 
<EOS>
I
never
conceive
you
could
become
indifferent
.
<EOS>
letter
be
no
matter
of
indifference
;
they
be
generally
a
very
positive
curse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
speak
of
letter
of
business
;
mine
be
letter
of
friendship

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
often
think
them
the
bad
of
the
two

reply
he
coolly

"
business
,
you
know
,
may
bring
money
,
but
friendship
hardly
ever

"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
you
be
not
serious
now

<EOS>
I
know
Mr.
John
Knightley
<EOS>
too
well
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
sure
he
understand
the
value
of
friendship
as
well
as
any
body
.
<EOS>
I
can
easily
believe
that
letter
be
very
little
to
you
,
much
less
than
to
me
,
but
it
be
not
your
be
ten
year
old
than
myself
which
make
the
difference

it
be
not
age
,
but
situation

You
have
every
body
dear
to
you
always
at
hand

I

probably
,
never
shall
again

therefore
till
I
have
outlive
all
my
affection

a
post

office

I
think

must
always
have
power
to
draw
me
out

bad
weather

day

John
Knightley

this

You

how
could
you
do
such

It

Jane

Mrs.

do
you

the
like

You

positively
exert
our

My

say
Mrs.

kindly

persuasively

I
certainly
do
feel
tempt
to
give
.
<EOS>
Miss

,
you
must
not
run
such
risk
.
 
<EOS>
liable
as
you
have
be
to
severe
cold
,
indeed
you
ought
to
be
particularly
careful
,
especially
at
this
time
of
year
.
<EOS>
the
spring
I
always
think
require
more
than
common
care
.
<EOS>
better
wait
an
hour
or
two
,
or
even
half
a
day
for
your
letter
,
than
run
the
risk
of
bring
on
your
cough
again

<EOS>
now
do
not
you
feel
that
you
have
?
<EOS>
yes
,
I
be
sure
you
be
much

reasonable

You
look

eagerly
rejoin
Mrs.

We
will
not
allow
her
to

such
a

"
 
and
nod
significantly
 
<EOS>

there
must
be
some
arrangement
make

there

I
shall
speak

Mr.

fetch
our

one
of

shall
inquire
for
yours

will
obviate
all
difficulty

from
_
us

I
really
think

my

you
can
have
no
scruple
to
accept
such
an
accommodation

<EOS>

You
be
extremely
kind

Jane

I

up
my
early
walk

I
be
advise
to
be
out

as
much
as
I
can

I
must
walk
somewhere

office
be
an
object

upon
my

I
have
scarcely
ever
have
a
bad
morning
before

<EOS>
"
My

Jane

say
no
more
about
it

<EOS>
the
thing
be
determined
,
that
is
(
laugh
affectedly
)
as
far
as
I
can
presume
to
determine
any
thing
without
the
concurrence
of
my
lord
and
master
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
Mrs.
Weston
,
you
and
I
must
be
cautious
how
we
express
ourselves
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
flatter
myself
,
my
dear
Jane
,
that
my
influence
be
not
entirely
wear
out

<EOS>
if
I
meet
with
no
insuperable
difficulty
therefore
,
consider
that
point
as
settle

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
excuse
me
,
"
say
Jane
earnestly
,
"
I
can
not
by
any
mean
consent
to
such
an
arrangement

so
needlessly
troublesome

the

oh
!
my

but
so
much

Patty

it

a
kindness
to
employ
our

<EOS>
Jane
look
as
if
she
do
not

to
be
conquer
;

instead
of
answer
,
she
begin
speak
again
to
Mr.
John
Knightley

<EOS>
"
the
post
-
office
be
a
wonderful
establishment

say
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
regularity
and
despatch
of
it
!
<EOS>
if
one
think
of
all
that
it
have
to
do
,
and
all
that
it
do
so
well
,
it
be
really
astonishing
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
certainly
very
well
regulated

so
seldom

any
negligence

so
seldom

constantly
pass
about

be
even
carry
wrong
 
and
not
one
in

I
suppose
,
actually
lose
!

and
when
one
consider
the
variety
of
hand

of
bad
hand
too
,
that
be
to
be
decipher
,
it
increase
the
wonder

<EOS>

the
clerk
grow
expert

They
must
begin
with
some
quickness

exercise

them

want
any
farther
explanation

the
variety

farther
talk

the
usual
observation
make

<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
it
assert

John

"
that
the

sort
of
handwriting
often
prevail
in
a
family

where
the

master
teach

it
be
natural
enough
.
<EOS>
but
for
that
reason

I
should
imagine
the
likeness

be
chiefly
confine
to
the
female

very
little
teaching
after
an
early
age

out

there

you

in

Emma
hear

say
in

half

whisper
to

here
come

dear
old
beau

his
gallantry

come
away
before
the
other
man

what
a
dear
creature
he
be
;
 
I
assure
you
I
like
him
excessively
.
<EOS>
I
admire
all
that
quaint
,
old
-
fashioned
politeness
;
it
be
much
more
to
my
taste

modern
ease

modern
ease
often
disgust
me

this
good
old
Mr.

I
wish
you
have
hear
his
gallant
speech
to
me
at
dinner

oh
!
<EOS>
I
assure
you
I
begin
to
think
my
caro
sposo
would
be
absolutely
jealous

I
fancy
<EOS>
I
be
rather
a
favourite
;
he
take
notice
of
my
gown

how
do
you
like
it

choice
 
handsome

I
think
,

I
do
not
know
whether
it
be
not
over
-
trim
;
I
have
the
great
dislike
to
the
idea
of
be
over
-
trim
 
quite
a
horror
of
finery
.
<EOS>
I
must
put
on
a
few
ornament
now
,
because
it
be
expect
of
me

<EOS>
a
bride
,
you
know
,
must
appear
like
a
bride
,
but
my
natural
taste
be
all
for
simplicity
;
a
simple
style
of
dress
be
so
infinitely
preferable
to
finery
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
quite
in
the
minority
,
I
believe
;
few
people
seem
to
value
simplicity
of
dress
,
 
show
and
finery
be
every
thing
.
<EOS>
I
have
some
notion
of
put
such
a
trimming
as
this
to
my
white
and
silver
poplin
.
<EOS>
do
you
think
it
will
look
well
?

<EOS>

whole
party

just
reassemble
in

drawing

Mr.

make
his
appearance

He
have
return
to

to
Hartfield

be
over

He
have
be
too
much
expect
by
the
good
judge

for
surprize
 
<EOS>

there
be
great
joy

Mr.
Woodhouse
be
almost
as
glad
to
see
him
now

as
he
would
have
be
sorry
to
see
him
before

John
Knightley
only
be
in
mute
astonishment

<EOS>
that
a
man
who
may
have
spend
his
evening
quietly
at
home
after
a
day
of
business
in
London
,
should
set
off
again
,
and
walk
half
a
mile
to
another
man
's
house
,
for
the
sake
of
be
in
mixed
company
till
bed
-
time
,
of
finish
his
day
in
the
effort
of
civility
and
the
noise
of
number

be
a
circumstance
to
strike
him
deeply
.

a
man
who
have
be
in
motion
since
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
and
may
now
have
be
still
,
who
have
be
long
talk
,
and
may
have
be
silent
,
who
have
be
in
more
than
one
crowd
,
and
may
have
be
alone
!
 
<EOS>
such
a
man
,
to
quit
the
tranquillity
and
independence
of
his
own
fireside
,
and
on
the
evening
of
a
cold
sleety
April
day
rush
out
again
into
the
world
!
 
<EOS>
Could
he
by
a
touch
of
his
finger
have
instantly
take
back
his
wife
,
there
would
have
be
a
motive
;
but
his
come
would
probably
prolong
rather
than
break
up
the
party
.
<EOS>
John
Knightley
look
at
him
with
amazement
,
then
shrug
his
shoulder

dare

she
rather

considerable

Mr.

however

too
eager

observant

too
communicative
to
want
other

be
very
well
satisfied
with

soon
move
away

make

happy

<EOS>
He
be
to
be
in
town
next
week
,
if
not
sooner
.
<EOS>
We
have
notice
of
it
in
a
letter
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
meet
the
letter
in
my
way
this
morning
,
and
see
my
son
's
hand
,
presume
to
open
it
 
though
it
be
not
direct
to
me
 
<EOS>
it
be
to
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
She
be
his
principal
correspondent
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
ever
get
a
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
you
absolutely
open
what
be
direct
to
her
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
 
<EOS>
(
laugh
affectedly
)
<EOS>
I
must
protest
against
that
.
 
<EOS>
a
most
dangerous
precedent
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
I
beg
<EOS>
you
will
not
let
your
neighbour
follow
your
example
.
 
<EOS>
upon
my
word
,
if
this
be
what
I
be
to
expect
,
we
marry
woman
must
begin
to
exert
ourselves
!
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
,
I
could
not
have
believe
it
of
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
aye
,
we
man
be
sad
fellow
.
<EOS>
You
must
take
care
of
yourself
,
Mrs.
Elton
.
 
<EOS>
this
letter
tell
us
 
it
be
a
short
letter
 
write
in
a
hurry
,
merely
to
give
us
notice
 
<EOS>
it
tell
us
that
they
be
all
come
up
to
town
directly
,
on
Mrs.
Churchill
's
account
 
<EOS>
she
have
not
be
well
the
whole
winter
,
and
think
Enscombe
too
cold
for
her
 
<EOS>
so
they
be
all
to
move
southward
without
loss
of
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
from
Yorkshire
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
Enscombe
be
in
Yorkshire
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
they
be
about
one
hundred
and
ninety
mile
from
London
,
a
considerable
journey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
upon
my
word
,
very
considerable
.
<EOS>
sixty
-
five
mile
farther
than
from
Maple
Grove
to
London
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
distance
,
Mr.
Weston
,
to
people
of
large
fortune
?
 
<EOS>
You
would
be
amazed
to
hear
how
my
brother
,
Mr.
Suckling
,
sometimes
fly
about
.
<EOS>
You
will
hardly
believe
me
 
but
twice
<EOS>
in
one
week
he
and
Mr.
Bragge
go
to
London
and
back
again
with
four
horse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
evil
of
the
distance
from
Enscombe
,
"
say
Mr.
Weston
,
"
be
,
that
Mrs.
Churchill
,
_
as
_
_
<EOS>
we
<EOS>
_
_
understand
_
,
have
not
be
able
to
leave
the
sofa
for
a
week
together
.
<EOS>
in
Frank
's
last
letter
she
complain
,
he
say
,
of
be
too
weak
to
get
into
her
conservatory
without
have
both
his
arm
and
his
uncle
's
!
<EOS>
this
,
you
know
,
speak
a
great
degree
of
weakness
 
<EOS>
but
now
she
be
so
impatient
to
be
in
town
,
that
she
mean
to
sleep
only
two
night
on
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
so
Frank
write
word
.
<EOS>
certainly
,
delicate
lady
have
very
extraordinary
constitution
,
Mrs.
Elton
.
<EOS>
You
must
grant
me
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
,
I
shall
grant
you
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
always
take
the
part
of
my
own
sex
.
<EOS>
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
give
you
notice
 
<EOS>
You
will
find
me
a
formidable
antagonist
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
I
always
stand
up
for
woman
 
<EOS>
and
I
assure
you
,
if
you
know
how
Selina
feel
with
respect
to
sleep
at
an
inn
,
you
would
not
wonder
at
<EOS>
Mrs.
Churchill
's
make
incredible
exertion
to
avoid
it
.
<EOS>
Selina
say
it
be
quite
horror
to
her
 
<EOS>
and
I
believe
I
have
catch
a
little
of
her
nicety
.
<EOS>
She
always
travel
with
her
own
sheet
;
an
excellent
precaution
.
<EOS>
do
Mrs.
Churchill
do
the
same
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
depend
upon
it
,
Mrs.
Churchill
do
every
thing
that
any
other
fine
lady
ever
do
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Churchill
will
not
be
second
to
any
lady
in
the
land
for
"
    
Mrs.
Elton
eagerly
interpose
with
,
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
,
do
not
mistake
me
.
<EOS>
Selina
be
no
fine
lady
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
do
not
run
away
with
such
an
idea
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
not
she
?
<EOS>
then
she
be
no
rule
for
Mrs.
Churchill
,
who
be
as
thorough
a
fine
lady
as
any
body
ever
beheld
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Elton
begin
to
think
she
have
be
wrong
in
disclaim
so
warmly
.
<EOS>
It
be
by
no
means
her
object
to
have
<EOS>
it
believe
that
her
sister
be
_
not
_
a
fine
lady
;
perhaps
there
be
want
of
spirit
in
the
pretence
of
it
;
 
and
she
be
consider
in
what
way
she
have
good
retract
,
when
Mr.
Weston
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Churchill
be
not
much
in
my
good
grace
,
as
you
may
suspect
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
quite
between
ourselves
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
fond
of
Frank
,
and
therefore
I
would
not
speak
ill
of
her
.
<EOS>
besides
,
she
be
out
of
health
now
;
but
_
that
_
indeed
,
by
her
own
account
,
she
have
always
be
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
say
so
to
every
body
,
Mrs.
Elton
,
but
I
have
not
much
faith
in
Mrs.
Churchill
's
illness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
she
be
really
ill
,
why
not
go
to
Bath
,
Mr.
Weston
?
 
<EOS>
to
Bath
,
or
to
Clifton
?
"
<EOS>
"
She
have
take
it
into
her
head
that
Enscombe
be
too
cold
for
her
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
I
suppose
,
that
she
be
tired
of
Enscombe
.
<EOS>
She
have
now
be
a
long
time
stationary
there
,
than
she
ever
be
before
,
and
she
begin
to
want
change
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
retired
place
.
<EOS>
a
fine
place
,
but
very
retired
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
aye
 
like
Maple
Grove
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
nothing
can
stand
more
retired
from
the
road
than
Maple
Grove
.
<EOS>
such
an
immense
plantation
all
round
it
!
<EOS>
You
seem
shut
out
from
every
thing
 
in
the
most
complete
retirement
.
 
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Churchill
probably
have
not
health
or
spirit
like
Selina
to
enjoy
that
sort
of
seclusion
.
<EOS>
or
,
perhaps
she
may
not
have
resource
enough
in
herself
to
be
qualified
for
a
country
life
.
<EOS>
I
always
say
a
woman
can
not
have
too
many
resource
 
<EOS>
and
I
feel
very
thankful
that
I
have
so
many
myself
as
to
be
quite
independent
of
society
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Frank
be
here
in
February
for
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
remember
to
have
hear
.
<EOS>
He
will
find
an
_
addition
_
to
the
society
of
Highbury
when
he
come
again
;
that
is
,
if
I
may
presume
to
call
myself
an
addition
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
he
may
never
have
hear
of
there
be
such
a
creature
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
too
loud
a
call
for
a
compliment
to
be
pass
by
,
and
Mr.
Weston
,
with
a
very
good
grace
,
immediately
exclaim
,
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
madam
!
<EOS>
nobody
but
yourself
could
imagine
such
a
thing
possible
.
<EOS>
not
hear
of
you
!
 
<EOS>
I
believe
Mrs.
Weston
's
letter
lately
have
be
full
of
very
little
else
than
Mrs.
Elton
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
do
his
duty
and
could
return
to
his
son
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
Frank
leave
us
,
"
continue
he
,
"
it
be
quite
uncertain
when
we
may
see
him
again
,
which
make
this
day
's
news
doubly
welcome
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
completely
unexpected
.
<EOS>
that
is
,
_
I
_
always
have
a
strong
persuasion
he
would
be
here
again
soon
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
something
favourable
would
turn
up
 
<EOS>
but
nobody
believe
me
.
<EOS>
He
and
Mrs.
Weston
be
both
dreadfully
despond
.
<EOS>
"
how
could
he
contrive
to
come
?
<EOS>
and
how
could
it
be
suppose
that
his
uncle
and
aunt
would
spare
him
again
?
"
<EOS>
and
so
forth
 
<EOS>
I
always
feel
that
something
would
happen
in
our
favour
;
and
so
it
have
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
I
have
observe
,
Mrs.
Elton
,
in
the
course
of
my
life
,
that
if
thing
be
go
untowardly
one
month
,
they
be
sure
to
mend
the
next
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
true
,
Mr.
Weston
,
perfectly
true
.
<EOS>
It
be
just
what
I
use
to
say
to
a
certain
gentleman
in
company
in
the
day
of
courtship
,
when
,
because
thing
do
not
go
quite
right
,
do
not
proceed
with
all
the
rapidity
which
suit
his
feeling
,
he
be
apt
to
be
in
despair
,
and
exclaim
that
he
be
sure
at
this
rate
it
would
be
_
<EOS>
May
_
before
Hymen
's
saffron
robe
would
be
put
on
for
us
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
the
pain
I
have
be
at
to
dispel
those
gloomy
idea
and
give
him
cheerfull
view
!
<EOS>
the
carriage
 
we
have
disappointment
about
the
carriage
;
 
<EOS>
one
morning
,
I
remember
,
he
come
to
me
quite
in
despair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
stop
by
a
slight
fit
of
coughing
,
and
Mr.
Weston
instantly
seize
the
opportunity
of
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
mention
<EOS>
May
May
be
the
very
month
which
Mrs.
Churchill
be
order
,
or
have
order
herself
,
to
spend
in
some
warm
place
than
Enscombe
 
in
short
,
to
spend
in
London
;
so
that
we
have
the
agreeable
prospect
of
frequent
visit
from
Frank
the
whole
spring
 
precisely
the
season
of
the
year
which
one
should
have
choose
for
it
:
<EOS>
day
almost
at
the
long
;
weather
genial
and
pleasant
,
always
invite
one
out
,
and
never
too
hot
for
exercise
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
here
before
,
we
make
the
good
of
it
;
but
there
be
a
good
deal
of
wet
,
damp
,
cheerless
weather
;
there
always
be
in
February
,
you
know
,
and
we
could
not
do
half
that
we
intend
.
<EOS>
now
will
be
the
time
.
<EOS>
this
will
be
complete
enjoyment
;
and
I
do
not
know
,
Mrs.
Elton
,
whether
the
uncertainty
of
our
meeting
,
the
sort
of
constant
expectation
there
will
be
of
his
come
in
to
-
day
or
to
-
morrow
,
and
at
any
hour
,
may
not
be
more
friendly
to
happiness
than
have
him
actually
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
the
state
of
mind
which
give
most
spirit
and
delight
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
be
pleased
with
my
son
;
but
you
must
not
expect
a
prodigy
.
<EOS>
He
be
generally
think
a
fine
young
man
,
but
do
not
expect
a
prodigy
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
's
partiality
for
him
be
very
great
,
and
,
as
you
may
suppose
,
most
gratify
to
me
.
<EOS>
She
think
nobody
equal
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
assure
you
,
Mr.
Weston
,
I
have
very
little
doubt
that
my
opinion
will
be
decidedly
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
so
much
in
praise
of
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
it
be
fair
to
observe
,
that
I
be
one
of
those
who
always
judge
for
themselves
,
and
be
by
no
means
implicitly
guide
by
other
.
<EOS>
I
give
you
notice
that
as
I
find
your
son
,
so
I
shall
judge
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
no
flatterer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
be
muse
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
say
he
presently
,
"
I
have
not
be
severe
upon
poor
Mrs.
Churchill
.
<EOS>
if
she
be
ill
I
should
be
sorry
to
do
her
injustice
;
but
there
be
some
trait
in
her
character
which
make
it
difficult
for
me
to
speak
of
her
with
the
forbearance
I
could
wish
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
be
ignorant
,
Mrs.
Elton
,
of
my
connexion
with
the
family
,
nor
of
the
treatment
I
have
meet
with
;
and
,
between
ourselves
,
the
whole
blame
of
it
be
to
be
lay
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
instigator
.
<EOS>
Frank
's
mother
would
never
have
be
slight
as
she
be
but
for
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Churchill
have
pride
;
but
his
pride
be
nothing
to
his
wife
's
:
his
be
a
quiet
,
indolent
,
gentlemanlike
sort
of
pride
that
would
harm
nobody
,
and
only
make
himself
a
little
helpless
and
tiresome
;
but
her
pride
be
arrogance
and
insolence
!
<EOS>
and
what
incline
one
less
to
bear
,
she
have
no
fair
pretence
of
family
or
blood
.
<EOS>
She
be
nobody
when
he
marry
her
,
barely
the
daughter
of
a
gentleman
;
but
ever
since
her
be
turn
into
a
Churchill
she
have
out
-
Churchill'd
them
all
in
high
and
mighty
claim
:
<EOS>
but
in
herself
,
I
assure
you
,
she
be
an
upstart
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
only
think
!
<EOS>
well
,
that
must
be
infinitely
provoking
!
<EOS>
I
have
quite
a
horror
of
upstart
.
<EOS>
Maple
Grove
have
give
me
a
thorough
disgust
to
people
of
that
sort
;
for
there
be
a
family
in
that
neighbourhood
who
be
such
an
annoyance
to
my
brother
and
sister
from
the
air
they
give
themselves
!
<EOS>
Your
description
of
Mrs.
Churchill
make
me
think
of
them
directly
.
<EOS>
People
of
the
name
of
Tupman
,
very
lately
settle
there
,
and
encumber
with
many
low
connexion
,
but
give
themselves
immense
air
,
and
expect
to
be
on
a
footing
with
the
old
establish
family
.
<EOS>
a
year
and
a
half
be
the
very
utmost
that
they
can
have
live
at
West
Hall
;
and
how
they
get
their
fortune
nobody
know
.
<EOS>
They
come
from
Birmingham
,
which
be
not
a
place
to
promise
much
,
you
know
,
Mr.
Weston
.
<EOS>
one
have
not
great
hope
from
Birmingham
.
<EOS>
I
always
say
there
be
something
direful
in
the
sound
:
but
nothing
more
be
positively
know
of
the
Tupmans
,
though
a
good
many
thing
I
assure
you
be
suspect
;
and
yet
by
their
manner
they
evidently
think
themselves
equal
even
to
my
brother
,
Mr.
Suckling
,
who
happen
to
be
one
of
their

doubt
their

well

for
Mr.
Knightley
seem
little
disposed
for

Mrs.
Elton
be
want
notice

nobody

she
be
herself
in
a
worry
of

would
have
make
her

silent

<EOS>
Mr.
John
Knightley
prove
more
talkative

his

<EOS>
He
be
to
leave
them
early
the

he
soon

well
,
Emma

I
do
not

I

any

more

you
have
your
sister
's
letter
,
and
every
thing
be
down
at
full
length
there
<EOS>
we
may
be
sure
.
<EOS>
My
charge
would
be
much
more
concise
than
her
be
,
and
probably
not
much
in
the

spirit
;
all
that
I
have
to
recommend
be
comprise
in

do
not
spoil
them
,
and
do
not
physic
them
.

<EOS>
"
I
rather
hope
to
satisfy
you
both

"
say
Emma

"
for
I
shall
do
all
in
my
power
to
make
them
happy

which
will
be
enough
for

happiness
must
preclude
false
indulgence

so

I

I
be

a

of
fresh
gaiety

very
well

as

I
suppose

it
strike
me
as
a

Emma

that
Henry

no

upon

exclaim
Emma

you
amuse
me

I
should
like
to
know
how
many
of
all
my
numerous
engagement
take
place
without
your
being
of
the
party

and
why
I
be
to
be
suppose
in
danger
of
want
leisure
to
attend
to
the
little
boy

<EOS>
these
amazing
engagement
of
mine
 
<EOS>
what
have
they
be
?
<EOS>
dine
once
with
the
Coles

have
a
ball
talk
of
,
which
never
take
place

<EOS>
I
can
understand
you
 
(
nod
at
Mr.
John
Knightley

<EOS>
your
good
fortune
in
meeting
with
so
many
of
your
friend
at

delight
you
too
much
to
pass
unnoticed

you

(
turn
to
Mr.
Knightley

who
know
how
very
,
very
seldom
I
be
ever
two
hour
from
Hartfield

why
you
should
foresee
such
a
series
of
dissipation
for
me
,
I
can
not
imagine
.
<EOS>
and
as
to
my
dear
little
boy
,
I
must
say
,
that
if
Aunt
Emma
have
not
time
for
them
,
I
do
not
think
they
would
fare
much
better
with
Uncle
Knightley
,
who
be
absent
from
home
about
five
hour
where
she
be
absent
one
 
and
who
,
when
he
be
at
home
,
be
either
read
to
himself
or
settle
his
account
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
seem
to
be
try
not
to
smile
;
and
succeed
without
difficulty
,
upon
Mrs.
Elton
's
beginning
to
talk
to
him
.
      
<EOS>
a
very
little
quiet
reflection
be
enough
to
satisfy
Emma
as
to
the
nature
of
her
agitation
on
hear
this
news
of
Frank
Churchill
.
<EOS>
She
be
soon
convince
that
it
be
not
for
herself
she
be
feel
at
all
apprehensive
or
embarrassed
;
it
be
for
him
.
<EOS>
Her
own
attachment
have
really
subside
into
a
mere
nothing
;
it
be
not
worth
thinking
of
;
 
but
if
he
,
who
have
undoubtedly
be
always
so
much
the
most
in
love
of
the
two
,
be
to
be
return
with
the
same
warmth
of
sentiment
which
he
have
take
away
,
it
would
be
very
distressing
.
<EOS>
if
a
separation
of
two
month
should
not
have
cool
him
,
there
be
danger
and
evil
before
her
:
 
<EOS>
caution
for
him
and
for
herself
would
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
mean
to
have
her
own
affection
entangle
again
,
and
it
would
be
incumbent
on
her
to
avoid
any
encouragement
of
his
.
  
<EOS>
She
wish
she
may
be
able
to
keep
him
from
an
absolute
declaration
.
<EOS>
that
would
be
so
very
painful
a
conclusion
of
their
present
acquaintance
!
<EOS>
and
yet
,
she
could
not
help
rather
anticipate
something
decisive
.
<EOS>
She
feel
as
if
the
spring
would
not
pass
without
bring
a
crisis
,
an
event
,
a
something
to
alter
her
present
compose
and
tranquil
state
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
very
long
,
though
rather
longer
than
Mr.
Weston
have
foresee
,
before
she
have
the
power
of
form
some
opinion
of
Frank
Churchill
's
feeling
.
<EOS>
the
Enscombe
family
be
not
in
town
quite
so
soon
as
have
be
imagine
,
but
he
be
at
Highbury
very
soon
afterwards
.
<EOS>
He
ride
down
for
a
couple
of
hour
;
he
could
not
yet
do
more
;
but
as
he
come
from
randall
immediately
to
Hartfield
,
she
could
then
exercise
all
her
quick
observation
,
and
speedily
determine
how
he
be
influence
,
and
how
she
must
act
.
<EOS>
They
meet
with
the
utmost
friendliness
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
his
great
pleasure
in
see
her
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
an
almost
instant
doubt
of
his
care
for
her
as
he
have
do
,
of
his
feeling
the
same
tenderness
in
the
same
degree
.
<EOS>
She
watch
him
well
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
clear
thing
he
be
less
in
love
than
he
have
be
.
<EOS>
absence
,
with
the
conviction
probably
of
her
indifference
,
have
produce
this
very
natural
and
very
desirable
effect
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
in
high
spirit
;
as
ready
to
talk
and
laugh
as
ever
,
and
seem
delighted
to
speak
of
his
former
visit
,
and
recur
to
old
story
:
and
he
be
not
without
agitation
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
in
his
calmness
that
she
read
his
comparative
difference
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
calm
;
his
spirit
be
evidently
flutter
;
there
be
restlessness
about
him
.
<EOS>
lively
as
he
be
,
it
seem
a
liveliness
that
do
not
satisfy
himself
;
but
what
decide
her
belief
on
the
subject
,
be
his
stay
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
hurry
away
to
make
other
call
in
Highbury
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
see
a
group
of
old
acquaintance
in
the
street
as
he
pass
 
he
have
not
stop
,
he
would
not
stop
for
more
than
a
word
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
the
vanity
to
think
they
would
be
disappoint
if
he
do
not
call
,
and
much
as
he
wish
to
stay
longer
at
Hartfield
,
he
must
hurry
off
.
<EOS>
"
She
have
no
doubt
as
to
his
be
less
in
love
 
<EOS>
but
neither
his
agitated
spirit
,
nor
his
hurrying
away
,
seem
like
a
perfect
cure
;
and
she
be
rather
inclined
to
think
it
imply
a
dread
of
her
return
power
,
and
a
discreet
resolution
of
not
trust
himself
with
her
long
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
only
visit
from
Frank
Churchill
in
the
course
of
ten
day
.
<EOS>
He
be
often
hope
,
intend
to
come
 
but
be
always
prevent
.
<EOS>
His
aunt
could
not
bear
to
have
him
leave
her
.
<EOS>
such
be
his
own
account
at
Randall
's
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
quite
sincere
,
if
he
really
try
to
come
,
it
be
to
be
infer
that
Mrs.
Churchill
's
removal
to
London
have
be
of
no
service
to
the
wilful
or
nervous
part
of
her
disorder
.
<EOS>
that
she
be
really
ill
be
very
certain
;
he
have
declare
himself
convinced
of
it
,
at
randall
.
<EOS>
though
much
may
be
fancy
,
he
could
not
doubt
,
when
he
look
back
,
that
she
be
in
a
weak
state
of
health
than
she
have
be
half
a
year
ago
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
believe
it
to
proceed
from
any
thing
that
care
and
medicine
may
not
remove
,
or
at
least
that
she
may
not
have
many
year
of
existence
before
her
;
but
he
could
not
be
prevail
on
,
by
all
his
father
's
doubt
,
to
say
that
her
complaint
be
merely
imaginary
,
or
that
she
be
as
strong
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
It
soon
appear
that
London
be
not
the
place
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
endure
its
noise
.
<EOS>
Her
nerve
be
under
continual
irritation
and
suffering
;
and
by
the
ten
day
'
end
,
her
nephew
's
letter
to
randall
communicate
a
change
of
plan
.
<EOS>
They
be
go
to
remove
immediately
to
Richmond
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Churchill
have
be
recommend
to
the
medical
skill
of
an
eminent
person
there
,
and
have
otherwise
a
fancy
for
the
place
.
<EOS>
a
ready
-
furnished
house
in
a
favourite
spot
be
engage
,
and
much
benefit
expect
from
the
change
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
hear
that
Frank
write
in
the
high
spirit
of
this
arrangement
,
and
seem
most
fully
to
appreciate
the
blessing
of
have
two
month
before
him
of
such
near
neighbourhood
to
many
dear
friend
 
for
the
house
be
take
for
May
and
June
.
<EOS>
She
be
tell
that
now
he
write
with
the
great
confidence
of
be
often
with
them
,
almost
as
often
as
he
could
even
wish
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
see
how
Mr.
Weston
understand
these
joyous
prospect
.
<EOS>
He
be
consider
her
as
the
source
of
all
the
happiness
they
offer
.
<EOS>
She
hope
it
be
not
so
.
<EOS>
two
month
must
bring
it
to
the
proof
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
's
own
happiness
be
indisputable
.
<EOS>
He
be
quite
delighted
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
very
circumstance
he
could
have
wish
for
.
<EOS>
now
,
it
would
be
really
have
Frank
in
their
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
what
be
nine
mile
to
a
young
man
?
 
<EOS>
an
hour
's
ride
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
always
come
over
.
<EOS>
the
difference
in
that
respect
of
Richmond
and
London
be
enough
to
make
the
whole
difference
of
see
him
always
and
see
him
never
.
<EOS>
sixteen
mile
 
nay
,
eighteen
 
<EOS>
it
must
be
full
eighteen
to
Manchester
-
street
 
<EOS>
be
a
serious
obstacle
.
<EOS>
be
he
ever
able
to
get
away
,
the
day
would
be
spend
in
come
and
return
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
comfort
in
have
him
in
London
;
he
may
as
well
be
at
Enscombe
;
but
Richmond
be
the
very
distance
for
easy
intercourse
.
<EOS>
well
than
near
!
  
<EOS>
one
good
thing
be
immediately
bring
to
a
certainty
by
this
removal
,
 
the
ball
at
the
Crown
.
<EOS>
It
have
not
be
forget
before
,
but
it
have
be
soon
acknowledge
vain
to
attempt
to
fix
a
day
.
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
it
be
absolutely
to
be
;
every
preparation
be
resume
,
and
very
soon
after
the
Churchills
have
remove
to
Richmond
,
a
few
line
from
Frank
,
to
say
that
his
aunt
feel
already
much
well
for
the
change
,
and
that
he
have
no
doubt
of
be
able
to
join
them
for
twenty
-
four
hour
at
any
give
time
,
induce
them
to
name
as
early
a
day
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
's
ball
be
to
be
a
real
thing
.
<EOS>
a
very
few
to
-
morrow
stand
between
the
young
people
of
Highbury
and
happiness

<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse

the
evil

May
be

<EOS>
Mrs.
Bates
be
engage
to
spend
the
evening
at
Hartfield
,
James
have
due
notice
,
and
he
sanguinely
hope
that
neither
dear
little
Henry
nor
dear
little
John
would
have
any
thing
the
matter
with
them
,
while
dear
Emma
be
go

<EOS>
no
misfortune
occur
,
again
to
prevent
the
ball
.
<EOS>
the
day
approach
,
the
day
arrive
;
and
after
a
morning
of
some
anxious
watching
,
Frank
Churchill
,
in
all
the
certainty
of
his
own
self
,
reach
randall
before
dinner
,
and
every
thing
be
safe
.
  
<EOS>
no
second
meeting
have
there
yet
be
between
him
and
Emma
.
<EOS>
the
room
at
the
Crown
be
to
witness
it
;
 
but
it
would
be
well
than
a
common
meeting
in
a
crowd
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
have
be
so
very
earnest
in
his
entreaty
for
her

as
soon
as
possible
after

the
purpose
of
take
her
opinion
as
to
the
propriety
and
comfort
of
the
room
before
any
other
person
come
,
that
she
could
not
refuse
him
,
and
must
therefore
spend
some
quiet
interval
in
the
young
man
's
company
.
<EOS>
She
be
to
convey
Harriet

and
they
drive
to
the
Crown

Frank
Churchill
seem
to
have
be
on
the
watch

and
though
he
do
not
say
much
,
his
eye
declare
that
he
mean
to
have
a
delightful
evening
.
<EOS>
They
all
walk
about
together
,
to
see
that
every
thing
be
as
it
should
be
;
and
within
a
few
minute
be
join
by
the
content
of
another
carriage
,
which
Emma
could
not
hear
the
sound
of

first
,
without
great
surprize
.
"
<EOS>
so
unreasonably
early
!
<EOS>
"
she
be
go
to
exclaim
;
but
she
presently
find
that
it
be
a
family
of
old
friend
,
who
be
come
,
like
herself
,
by
particular
desire
,
to
help
Mr.
Weston
's
judgment
;
and
they
be
so
very
closely
follow
by
another
carriage
of
cousin
,
who
have
be
entreat
to
come
early
with
the
same
distinguishing
earnestness
,
on
the
same
errand
,
<EOS>
that
it
seem
as
if
half
the
company
may
soon
be
collect
together
for
the
purpose
of
preparatory
inspection
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
perceive
that
her
taste
be
not
the
only
taste
on
which
Mr.
Weston
depend
,
and
feel
,
that
to
be
the
favourite
and
intimate
of
a
man
who
have
so
many
intimate
and
confidante
,
be
not
the
very
first
distinction
in
the
scale
of
vanity
.
<EOS>
She
like
his
open
manner
,
but
a
little
less
of
open
-
heartedness
would
have
make
him
a
high
character
.
 
<EOS>
general
benevolence
,
but
not
general
friendship
,
make
a
man
what
he
ought
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
fancy
such
a
man
.
<EOS>
the
whole
party
walk
about
,
and
look
,
and
praise
again
;
and
then
,
have
nothing
else

,
form
a
sort
of
half

circle
round
the
fire

to
observe

<EOS>
Emma

that
it

<EOS>
They

Mr.

but
Mrs.
Elton
detain
him
,
to
gratify
him
by
her
opinion
of
his
son
;
and
so
briskly
do
she
begin
,
that
the
young
man
himself
,
though
by
no
mean
move
slowly
,
could
hardly
be
out

You

my

I
be
happy

I
be
extremely
pleased
with
him

<EOS>
You
may
believe
me
.
<EOS>
I
never

<EOS>
I

him
a

his
manner
be
precisely
what
I
like
and
approve
 
so
truly
<EOS>
the
gentleman

without
the
least
conceit

puppyism

<EOS>
You
must
know
I
have
a
vast
dislike

puppy
 
quite
a
horror
of
them

<EOS>
They

never

Maple
Grove

<EOS>
neither
Mr.
Suckling

ever
any

sometimes
to

very
cut
thing

Selina

Her

whether

<EOS>
after

compliment
to

look

compliment
very
quietly
and
properly
take
,
Mrs.

be
evidently
want
to
be
compliment

Mrs.

nobody

"
oh
!
<EOS>
you
have
find
us
out
at
last
,
have
you
,
in
our
seclusion
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
this
moment
tell
Jane
<EOS>
,
I
think
you
would
begin
to
be
impatient
for
tiding
of
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Jane
!
"
 
<EOS>
repeat
Frank
Churchill
,
with
a
look
of
surprize
and
displeasure
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
easy
 
but
Miss
Fairfax
do
not
disapprove
it
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
how
do
you
like
Mrs.
Elton
?
"
say
Emma
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
ungrateful
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
ungrateful
!
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
then
change
from
a
frown
to
a
smile
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
do
not
tell
me
 
I
do
not
want
to
know
what
you
mean
.
 
<EOS>
where
be
my
father
?
 
<EOS>
when
be
we
to
begin
dance
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
could
hardly
understand
him
;
he
seem
in
an
odd
humour
.
<EOS>
He
walk
off
to
find
his
father
,
but
be
quickly
back
again
with
both
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
He
have
meet
with
them
in
a
little
perplexity
,
which
must
be
lay
before
Emma
.
<EOS>
It
have
just
occur
to
Mrs.
Weston
that
Mrs.
Elton
must
be
ask
to
begin
the
ball
;
that
she
would
expect
it
;
which
interfere
with
all
their
wish
of
give
Emma
that
distinction
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
hear
the
sad
truth
with
fortitude
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
be
we
to
do
for
a
proper
partner
for
her
?
"
say
Mr.
Weston
.
<EOS>
"
She
will
think
Frank
ought
to
ask
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
turn
instantly
to
Emma
,
to
claim
her
former
promise
;
and
boast
himself
an
engaged
man
,
which
his
father
look
his
most
perfect
approbation
of
 
and
it
then
appear
that
Mrs.
Weston
be
want
_
him
_
to
dance
with
Mrs.
Elton
himself
,
and
that
their
business
be
to
help
to
persuade
him
into
it
,
which
be
do
pretty
soon
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
and
Mrs.
Elton
lead
the
way
,
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
and
Miss
Woodhouse
follow
.
<EOS>
Emma
must
submit
to
stand
second
to
Mrs.
Elton
,
though
she
have
always
consider
the
ball
as
peculiarly
for
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
almost
enough
to
make
her
think
of
marry
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Elton
have
undoubtedly
the
advantage
,
at
this
time
,
in
vanity
completely
gratify
;
for
though
she
have
intend
to
begin
with
Frank
Churchill
,
she
could
not
lose
by
the
change
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
may
be
his
son
's
superior
.
 
<EOS>
in
spite
of
this
little
rub
,
however
,
Emma
be
smile
with
enjoyment
,
delighted
to
see
the
respectable
length
of
the
set
as
it
be
form
,
and
to
feel
that
she
have
so
many
hour
of
unusual
festivity
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
more
disturb
by
Mr.
Knightley
's
not
dance
than
by
any
thing
else
.
 
<EOS>
there
he
be
,
among
the
stander
-
by
,
where
he
ought
not
to
be
;
he
ought
to
be
dance
,
 
not
class
himself
with
the
husband
,
and
father
,
and
whist
-
player
,
who
be
pretend
to
feel
an
interest
in
the
dance
till
their
rubber
be
make
up
,
 
so
young
as
he
look
!
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
appear
to
great
advantage
perhaps
anywhere
,
than
where
he
have
place
himself
.
<EOS>
His
tall
,
firm
,
upright
figure
,
among
the
bulky
form
and
stoop
shoulder
of
the
elderly
man
,
be
such
as
Emma
felt
must
draw
every
body
's
eye
;
and
,
except
her
own
partner
,
there
be
not
one
among
the
whole
row
of
young
man
who
could
be
compare
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
move
a
few
step
near
,
and
those
few
step
be
enough
to
prove
in
how
gentlemanlike
a
manner
,
with
what
natural
grace
,
he
must
have
dance
,
<EOS>
would
he
but
take
the
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
whenever
she
catch
his
eye
,
she
force
him
to
smile
;
but
in
general
he
be
look
grave
.
<EOS>
She
wish
he
could
love
a
ballroom
better
,
and
could
like
Frank
Churchill
better
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
often
observe
her
.
<EOS>
She
must
not
flatter
herself
that
he
think
of
her
dancing
,
but
if
he
be
criticise
her
behaviour
,
she
do
not
feel
afraid
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
like
flirtation
between
her
and
her
partner
.
<EOS>
They
seem
more
like
cheerful
,
easy
friend
,
than
lover
.
<EOS>
that
Frank
Churchill
think
less
of
her
than
he
have
do
,
be
indubitable
.
  
<EOS>
the
ball
proceed
pleasantly
.
<EOS>
the
anxious
care
,
the
incessant
attention
of
Mrs.
Weston
,
be
not
throw
away
.
<EOS>
every
body
seem
happy
;
and
the
praise
of
be
a
delightful
ball
,
which
be
seldom
bestow
till
after
a
ball
have
cease
to
be
,
be
repeatedly
give
in
the
very
beginning
of
the
existence
of
this
.
<EOS>
of
very
important
,
very
recordable
event
,
it
be
not
more
productive
than
such
meeting
usually
be
.
<EOS>
there
be
one
,
however
,
which
Emma
think
something
of
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
last
dance
before
supper
be
begin
,
and
Harriet
have
no
partner
;
 
the
only
young
lady
sit
down
;
 
and
so
equal
<EOS>
have
be
hitherto
the
number
of
dancer
<EOS>
,
that
how
there
could
be
any
one
disengaged
be
the
wonder
!
 
<EOS>
but
Emma
's
wonder
lessen
soon
afterwards
,
on
see
Mr.
Elton
saunter
about
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
ask
Harriet
to
dance
if
it
be
possible
to
be
avoid
:
she
be
sure
he
would
not
 
<EOS>
and
she
be
expect
him
every
moment
to
escape
into
the
card
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
Escape
,
however
,
be
not
his
plan
.
<EOS>
He
come
to
the
part
of
the
room
where
the
sitter
-
by
be
collect
,
speak
to
some
,
and
walk
about
in
front
of
them
,
as
if
to
shew
his
liberty
,
and
his
resolution
of
maintain
it
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
omit
be
sometimes
directly
before
Miss
Smith
,
or
speak
to
those
who
be
close
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
see
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
yet
dance
;
she
be
work
her
way
up
from
the
bottom
,
and
have
therefore
leisure
to
look
around
,
and
by
only
turn
her
head
a
little
she
see
it
all
.
<EOS>
when
she
be
half
-
way
up
the
set
,
the
whole
group
be
exactly
behind
her
,
and
she
would
no
longer
allow
her
eye
to
watch
;
but
Mr.
Elton
be
so
near
,
that
she
hear
every
syllable
of
a
dialogue
which
just
then
take
place
between
him
and
Mrs.
Weston
;
and
she
perceive
that
his
wife
,
who
be
stand
immediately
above
her
,
be
not
only
listen
also
,
but
even
encourage
him
by
significant
glance
.
 
<EOS>
the
kind
-
hearted
,
gentle
Mrs.
Weston
have
leave
her
seat
to
join
him
and
say
,
"

not

Mr.
Elton
?
"
to
which
his
prompt
reply
be
,
"
most
readily
,
Mrs.
Weston
,
if
you
will
dance
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Me

<EOS>
oh

<EOS>

I
would
get
you
a
well
partner
than

<EOS>
"
if

for

to
feel
myself
rather
an
old
married
man
,
and
that
my
dancing
day

it
would
give
me
very
great
pleasure
at
any
time
to
stand
up
with
an
old
friend
like
Mrs.
Gilbert
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mrs.
Gilbert
do
not
mean
to
dance
,
but
there

a
young
lady

whom
I
should
be
very
glad
to
see
dance
 
Miss

"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
say
no
more
;
and
Emma
could
imagine
with
what
surprize
and
mortification
she
must
be
return
to
her
seat
.
<EOS>
this
be
Mr.
Elton

<EOS>
the
amiable
,
obliging
,
gentle
Mr.
Elton
.
 
<EOS>
She
look
round
for
a
moment
;
he

join
Mr.
Knightley
at
a
little
distance
,
and

for
settle
conversation

She

Her
heart

in
a
glow

<EOS>
in
another
moment

happy
sight
catch
her
;
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley

Harriet
to
the
set

<EOS>
never
have
she
be
more
surprized
,
seldom
more
delighted

than
at
that
instant

<EOS>
She

and
gratitude

for
Harriet
and

and
though
too
distant
for
speech
,
her
countenance
say
much
,
as
soon
as
she
could
catch
his
eye
again
.
  
<EOS>
His
dancing
prove
to
be
just
what
she
have
believe
it
,
extremely
good
;
and
Harriet
would
have
seem
almost
too
lucky
,
if
it
have
not
be
for
the
cruel
state
of
thing
before
,
and
for
the
very
complete
enjoyment

I

I

little
disappointment

the
bake
apple

but
there

first
,
and
good
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
not
think
the
asparagus

boil
enough

<EOS>
now
there
be
nothing
grandmama
love
better
than
sweetbread
and
asparagus
 
<EOS>
so
she
be
rather
disappointed
,
but
we
agree
we
would
not
speak
of
it
to
any
body

for
fear
of
its
get
round

<EOS>
Emma

no
opportunity
of

to
Mr.
Knightley

after
supper
;
but
,
when
they
be
all
in
the
ballroom
again
,
her
eye
invite
him
irresistibly
to
come
to
her
and
be
thank
.
<EOS>
He
be
warm
in
his
reprobation
of
Mr.
Elton
's
conduct
;
it
have
be
unpardonable
rudeness
;
and
Mrs.
Elton
's
look

receive
the
due
share
of
censure

<EOS>
"
They

<EOS>
She

<EOS>
I
suspect
,
whatever
he
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
to
that
surmise
,
you
say
nothing

of
course
;
but
confess
,
Emma
,
that
you
do
want
him
to
marry
Harriet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,

reply
Emma
,
"
and
they
can
not
forgive
me

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
shake
his
head
;
but
there
be
a
smile
of
indulgence
with
it
,
and
he
only
say
,
  
"
I
shall
not
scold
you

<EOS>
I
leave
you
to
your
own
reflection

"
Can
you
trust
me

such
flatterer

do
my

ever
tell
me
I
be
wrong

not
your

you
of
it

<EOS>
"
I
do
own
myself
to
have
be
completely
mistake
in
Mr.
Elton

<EOS>
there
be
a
littleness
about
him
which
you
discover
,
and
which
I
do
not
:
and
I
be
fully
convince
of
his
being
in
love
with
Harriet

<EOS>
It
be
through
a
series
of
strange
blunder

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

and
,
in
return
for
your
acknowledge
so
much
,
I
will
do
you
the
justice
to
say

that
you
would
have
choose
for
him
better
than

<EOS>
Harriet
Smith
have
some
first
-
rate
quality
,
which
Mrs.
Elton
be
totally
without

<EOS>
an
unpretending
,
single
-
minded
,
artless
girl
 
infinitely
to
be
prefer
by
any
man
of
sense
and
taste
to
such
a
woman
as
Mrs.
Elton

<EOS>
I
find
Harriet
more
conversable
than
I
expect

"
  
<EOS>
Emma
be
extremely
gratified
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
interrupt
by
the
bustle
of
Mr.
Weston
call
on
every

"

Come

I

Mr.

She
hesitate
a
moment

and
then

<EOS>
"
indeed

<EOS>
You
have
shew
that
you

and
you
know
we
be
not

so
much
brother

sister
as
to
make
it
at
all
improper

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
brother
and
sister
!
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
this
little
explanation
with
Mr.
Knightley
give
Emma
considerable
pleasure
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
the
agreeable
recollection
of
the
ball
,
which
she
walk
about
the
lawn
the
next
morning
to
enjoy
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
extremely
glad
that
they
have
come
to
<EOS>
so
good
an
understanding
respect
the
Eltons
,
and
that
their
opinion
of
both
husband
and
wife
be
so
much
alike
;
and
his
praise
of
Harriet
,
his
concession
in
her
favour
,
be
peculiarly
gratify
.
<EOS>
the
impertinence
of
the
Eltons
,
which
for
a
few
minute
have
threaten
to
ruin
the
rest
of
her
evening
,
have
be
the
occasion
of
some
of
its
high
satisfaction
;
and
she
look
forward
to
another
happy
result
 
the
cure
of
Harriet
's
infatuation
.
 
<EOS>
from
Harriet
's
manner
of
speak
of
the
circumstance
before
they
quit
the
ballroom
,
she
have
strong
hope
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
her
eye
be
suddenly
open
,
and
she
be
enable
to
see
that
Mr.
Elton
be
not
the
superior
creature
she
have
believe
him
.
<EOS>
the
fever
be
over
,
and
Emma
could
harbour
little
fear
of
the
pulse
be
quicken
again
by
injurious
courtesy
.
<EOS>
She
depend
on
the
evil
feeling
of
the
elton
for
supply
all
the
discipline
of
pointed
neglect
that
could
be
farther
requisite
.
 
<EOS>
Harriet
rational
,
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
not
too
much
in
love
,
and
Mr.
Knightley
not
want
to
quarrel
with
her
,
how
very
happy
a
summer
must
be
before
her
!
  
<EOS>
She
be
not
to
see
Frank
Churchill
this
morning
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
her
that
he
could
not
allow
himself
the
pleasure
of
stop
at
Hartfield
,
as
he
be
to
be
at
home
by
the
middle
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
regret
it
.
  
<EOS>
have
arrange
all
these
matter
,
look
them
through
,
and
put
them
all
to
right
,
she
be
just
turn
to
the
house
with
spirit
freshen
up
for
the
demand
of
the
two
little
boy
,
as
well
as
of
their
grandpapa
,
when
the
great
iron
sweep
-
gate
open
,
and
two
person
enter
whom
she
have
never
less
expect
to
see
together
 
Frank
Churchill
,
with
Harriet
lean
on
his
arm
 
<EOS>
actually
Harriet
!
 
<EOS>
a
moment
suffice
to
convince
her
that
something
extraordinary
have
happen
.
<EOS>
Harriet
look
white
and
frightened
,
and
he
be
try
to
cheer
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
iron
gate
and
the
front
-
door
be
not
twenty
yard
asunder
;
 
they
be
all
three
soon
in
the
hall
,
and
Harriet
immediately
sink
into
a
chair
faint
away
.
  
<EOS>
a
young
lady
who
faint
,
must
be
recover
;
question
must
be
answer
,
and
surprize
be
explain
.
<EOS>
such
event
be
very
interesting
,
but
the
suspense
of
them
can
not
last
long
.
<EOS>
a
few
minute
make
Emma
acquaint
with
the
whole
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Smith
,
and
Miss
Bickerton
,
another
parlour
boarder
at
Mrs.
Goddard
's
,
who
have
be
also
at
the
ball
,
have
walk
out
together
,
and
take
a
road
,
the
Richmond
road
,
which
,
though
apparently
public
enough
for
safety
,
have
lead
them
into
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
about
half
a
mile
beyond
Highbury
,
make
a
sudden
turn
,
and
deeply
shade
by
elm
on
each
side
,
it
become
for
a
considerable
stretch
very
retired
;
and
when
the
young
lady
have
advance
some
way
into
it
,
they
have
suddenly
perceive
at
a
small
distance
before
them
,
on
a
broad
patch
of
greensward
by
the
side
,
a
party
of
gipsy
.
<EOS>
a
child
on
the
watch
,
come
towards
them
to
beg
;
and
Miss
Bickerton
,
excessively
frighten
,
give
a
great
scream
,
and
call
on
Harriet
to
follow
her
,
run
up
a
steep
bank
,
clear
a
slight
hedge
at
the
top
,
and
make
the
good
of
her
way
by
a
short
cut
back
to
Highbury
.
<EOS>
but
poor
Harriet
could
not
follow
.
<EOS>
She
have
suffer
very
much
from
cramp
after
dance
,
and
her
first
attempt
to
mount
the
bank
bring
on
such
a
return
of
it
as
make
her
absolutely
powerless
 
and
in
this
state
,
and
exceedingly
terrified
,
she
have
be
oblige
to
remain
.
  
<EOS>
how
the
tramper
may
have
behave
,
have
the
young
lady
be
more
courageous
,
must
be
doubtful
;
but
such
an
invitation
for
attack
could
not
be
resist
;
and
Harriet
be
soon
assail
by
half
a
dozen
child
,
head
by
a
stout
woman
and
a
great
boy
,
all
clamorous
,
and
impertinent
in
look
,
though
not
absolutely
in
word
.
 
<EOS>
More
and
more
frightened
,
she
immediately
promise
them
money
,
and
take
out
her
purse
,
give
them
a
shilling
,
and
beg
them
not
to
want
more
,
or
to
use
her
ill
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
then
able
to
walk
,
though
but
slowly
,
and
be
move
away
 
but
her
terror
and
her
purse
be
too
tempting
,
and
she
be
follow
,
or
rather
surround
,
by
the
whole
gang
,
demand
more
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
state
Frank
Churchill
have
find
her
,
she
tremble
and
condition
,
they
loud
and
insolent
.
<EOS>
by
a
most
fortunate
chance
his
leave
Highbury
have
be
delay
so
as
to
bring
him
to
her
assistance
at
this
critical
moment
.
<EOS>
the
pleasantness
of
the
morning
have
induce
him
to
walk
forward
,
and
leave
his
horse
to
meet
him
by
another
road
,
a
mile
or
two
beyond
Highbury
 
and
happen
to
have
borrow
a
pair
of
scissor
the
night
before
of
Miss
Bates
,
and
to
have
forget
to
restore
them
,
he
have
be
oblige
to
stop
at
her
door
,
and
go
in
for
a
few
minute
:
he
be
therefore
later
than
he
have
intend
;
and
be
on
foot
,
be
unseen
by
the
whole
party
till
almost
close
to
them
.
<EOS>
the
terror
which
the
woman
and
boy
have
be
create
in
Harriet
be
then
their
own
portion
.
<EOS>
He
have
leave
them
completely
frighten
;
and
Harriet
eagerly
cling
to
him
,
and
hardly
able
to
speak
,
have
just
strength
enough
to
reach
Hartfield
,
before
her
spirit
be
quite
overcome
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
idea
to
bring
her
to
Hartfield
:
he
have
think
of
no
other
place
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
amount
of
the
whole
story
,
 
of
his
communication
and
of
Harriet
<EOS>
's
as
soon
as
she
have
recover
her
sense
and
speech
.
 
<EOS>
He
dare
not
stay
longer
than
to
see
her
well
;
these
several
delay
leave
him
not
another
minute
to
lose
;
and
Emma
engage
to
give
assurance
of
her
safety
to
Mrs.
Goddard
,
and
notice
of
there
be
such
a
set
of
people
in
the
neighbourhood
to
Mr.
Knightley
,
he
set
off
,
with
all
the
grateful
blessing
that
she
could
utter
for
her
friend
and
herself
.
  
<EOS>
such
an
adventure
as
this
,
 
a
fine
young
man
and
a
lovely
young
woman
throw
together
in
such
a
way
,
could
hardly
fail
of
suggest
certain
idea
to
the
cold
heart
and
the
steady
brain
.
<EOS>
so
Emma
think
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
Could
a
linguist
,
could
a
grammarian
,
could
even
a
mathematician
have
see
what
she
do
,
have
witness
their
appearance
together
,
and
hear
their
history
of
it
,
without
feel
that
circumstance
have
be
at
work
to
make
them
peculiarly
interesting
to
each
other
?
 
<EOS>
how
much
more
must
an
imaginist
,
like
herself
,
be
on
fire
with
speculation
and
foresight
!
 
<EOS>
especially
with
such
a
groundwork
of
anticipation
as
her
mind
have
already
make
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
extraordinary
thing
!
<EOS>
nothing
of
the
sort
have
ever
occur
before
to
any
young
lady
in
the
place
,
within
her
memory
;
no
rencontre
,
no
alarm
of
the
kind
;
 
and
now
it
have
happen
to
the
very
person
,
and
at
the
very
hour
,
when
the
other
very
person
be
chance
to
pass
by
to
rescue
her
!
 
<EOS>
It
certainly
be
very
extraordinary
!
 
<EOS>
and
know
,
as
she
do
,
the
favourable
state
of
mind
of
each
at
this
period
,
it
strike
her
the
more
.
<EOS>
He
be
wish
to
get
the
well
of
his
attachment
to
herself
<EOS>
,
she
just
recover
from
her
mania
for
Mr.
Elton
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
every
thing
unite
to
promise
the
most
interesting
consequence
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
possible
that
the
occurrence
should
not
be
strongly
recommend
each
to
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
few
minute
'
conversation
which
she
have
yet
have
with
him
,
while
Harriet
have
be
partially
insensible
,
he
have
speak
of
her
terror
,
her
naivete
,
her
fervour
as
she
seize
and
cling
to
his
arm
,
with
a
sensibility
amuse
and
delighted
;
and
just
at
last
,
after
Harriet
's
own
account
have
be
give
,
he
have
express
his
indignation
at
the
abominable
folly
of
Miss
Bickerton
in
the
warm
term
.
<EOS>
every
thing
be
to
take
its
natural
course
,
however
,
neither
impel
nor
assist
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
stir
a
step
,
nor
drop
a
hint
.
<EOS>
no
,
she
have
have
enough
of
interference
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
harm
in
a
scheme
,
a
mere
passive
scheme
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
more
than
a
wish
.
<EOS>
beyond
it
she
would
on
no
account
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
's
first
resolution
be
to
keep
her
father
from
the
knowledge
of
what
have
pass
,
 
aware
of
the
anxiety
and
alarm
it
would
occasion
:
but
she
soon
feel
that
concealment
must
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
within
half
an
hour
it
be
know
all
over
Highbury
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
very
event
to
engage
those
who
talk
most
,
the
young
and
the
low
;
and
all
the
youth
and
servant
in
the
place
be
soon
in
the
happiness
of
frightful
news
.
<EOS>
the
last
night
's
ball
seem
lose
in
the
gipsy
.
<EOS>
poor
Mr.
Woodhouse
tremble
as
he
sit
,
and
,
as
Emma
have
foresee
,
would
scarcely
be
satisfied
without
their
promising
never
to
go
beyond
the
shrubbery
again
.
<EOS>
It
be
some
comfort
to
him
that
many
inquiry
after
himself
and
Miss
Woodhouse
(
for
his
neighbour
know
that
he
love
to
be
inquire
after
)
,
as
well
as
Miss
Smith
,
be
come
in
during
the
rest
of
the
day
;
and
he
have
the
pleasure
of
return
for
answer
,
that
they
be
all
very
indifferent
 
<EOS>
which
,
though
not
exactly
true
,
for
she
be
perfectly
well
,
and
Harriet
not
much
otherwise
,
Emma
would
not
interfere
with
.
<EOS>
She
have
an
unhappy
state
of
health
in
general
for
the
child
of
such
a
man
,
for
she
hardly
know
what
indisposition
be
;
and
if
he
do
not
invent
illness
for
her
,
she
could
make
no

in

message

<EOS>
the
gipsy
do
not
wait
for
the
operation
of
justice
;
they
take
themselves
off
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
the
young
lady
of
Highbury
may
have
walk
again
in
safety
before
their
panic
begin
,
and
the
whole
history
dwindle
soon
into
a
matter
of
little
importance
but
to
Emma
and
her
nephews
:
 
in
her
imagination
<EOS>
it
maintain
its
ground
,
and
Henry
and
John
be
still
ask
every
day
for
the
story
of
Harriet
and
the
gipsy
,
and
still
tenaciously
set
her
right
if
she
vary
in
the
slight
particular
from
the
original
recital
.
    
<EOS>
a
very
few
day
have
pass
after
this
adventure
,
when
Harriet
come
one
morning
to
Emma
with
a
small
parcel
in
her
hand
,
and
after
sit
down
and
hesitating
,
thus
begin
:
  
"
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
 
if
you
be
at
leisure
 
<EOS>
I
have
something
that
I
should
like
to
tell
you
 
a
sort
of
confession
to
make
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
you
know
,
it
will
be
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
be
a
good
deal
surprize
;
but
beg
her
to
speak
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
seriousness
in
Harriet
's
manner
which
prepare
her
,
quite
as
much
as
her
word
,
for
something
more
than
ordinary
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
duty
,
and
I
be
sure
it
be
my
wish
,
"
she
continue
,
"
to
have
no
reserve
with
you
on
this
subject
.
<EOS>
as
I
be
happily
quite
an
alter
creature
in
_
one
<EOS>
_
_
respect
<EOS>
_
,
it
be
very
fit
that
you
should
have
the
satisfaction
of
know
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
to
say
more
than
be
necessary
 
<EOS>
I
be
too
much
ashamed
of
have
give
way
as
I
have
do
,
and
I
dare
say
you
understand
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Emma
,
"
<EOS>
I
hope
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
I
could
so
long
a
time
be
fancy
myself
!
...
<EOS>
"
cry
Harriet
,
warmly
.
<EOS>
"
It
seem
like
madness
!
<EOS>
I
can
see
nothing
at
all
extraordinary
in
him
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
whether
I
meet
him
or
not
 
except
that
of
the
two
I
have
rather
not
see
him
 
<EOS>
and
indeed
I
would
go
any
distance
round
to
avoid
him
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
envy
his
wife
in
the
least
;
I
neither
admire
her
nor
envy
her
,
as
I
have
do
:
she
be
very
charming
,
I
dare
say
,
and
all
that
,
but
I
think
her
very
ill
-
tempered
and
disagreeable
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
her
look
the
other
night
!
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
assure
you
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
I
wish
her
no
evil
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
let
them
be
ever
so
happy
together
,
it
will
not
give
me
another
moment
's
pang
:
and
to
convince
you
that
I
have
be
speak
truth
,
I
be
now
go
to
destroy
 
what
I
ought
to
have
destroy
long
ago
 
what
I
ought
never
to
have
keep
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
very
well
(
blush
as
she
speak
)
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
now
I
will
destroy
it
all
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
my
particular
wish
to
do
it
in
your
presence
,
that
you
may
see
how
rational
I
be
grow
.
<EOS>
can
not
you
guess
what
this
parcel
hold
?
<EOS>
"
say
she
,
with
a
conscious
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
the
least
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
do
he
ever
give
you
any
thing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
 
I
can
not
call
them
gift
;
but
they
be
thing
that
I
have
value
very
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
hold
the
parcel
towards
her
,
and
Emma
read
the
word
_
Most
_
_
precious
_
<EOS>
_
treasure
_
on
the
top
.
<EOS>
Her
curiosity
be
greatly
excited
.
<EOS>
Harriet
unfold
the
parcel
,
and
she
look
on
with
impatience
.
<EOS>
within
abundance
of
silver
paper
be
a
pretty
little
Tunbridge
-
ware
box
,
which
Harriet
open
:
<EOS>
it
be
well
line
with
the
soft
cotton
;
but
,
except
the
cotton
,
Emma
see
only
a
small
piece
of
court
-
plaister
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
"
say
Harriet
,
"
you
_
must
_
recollect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
dear
me
!
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
think
it
possible
<EOS>
you
could
forget
what
pass
in
this
very
room
about
court
-
plaister
,
one
of
the
very
last
time
we
ever
meet
in
it
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
but
<EOS>
a
very
few
day
before
I
have
my
sore
throat
 
just
before
Mr.
and
Mrs.
John
Knightley
come
 
<EOS>
I
think
the
very
evening
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
remember
his
cut
his
finger
with
your
new
penknife
,
and
your
recommend
court
-
plaister
?
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
you
have
none
about
you
,
and
know
I
have
,
you
desire
me
to
supply
him
;
and
so
I
take
mine
out
and
cut
him
a
piece
;
but
it
be
a
great
deal
too
large
,
and
he
cut
it
small
,
and
keep
play
some
time
with
what
be
leave
,
before
he
give
it
back
to
me
.
<EOS>
and
so
then
,
in
my
nonsense
,
I
could
not
help
make
a
treasure
of
it
 
<EOS>
so
I
put
it
by
never
to
be
use
,
and
look
at
it
now
<EOS>
and
then
as
a
great
treat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
Harriet
!
<EOS>
"
cry
Emma
,
put
her
hand
before
her
face
,
and
jump
up
,
"
you
make
me
more
ashamed
of
myself
than
I
can
bear
.
<EOS>
remember
it
?
<EOS>
aye
,
I
remember
it
all
now
;
all
,
except
your
saving
this
relic
 
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
of
that
till
this
moment

but
the
cut
the
finger

my

none
about

my

my
sin

I

one
of
my
senseless
trick

all
the

well

down
again

you
really
some
at

I
never

it

you
do
it
so
naturally

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
you
actually
put
this
piece
of
court

plaister
by
for
his

Emma

from
her
state
of
shame

between
wonder

amusement

secretly
she
add
to
herself

when

still
more
valuable

<EOS>
Emma
be
quite
eager
to
see
this
superior
treasure

<EOS>
It
be
the
end
of
an
old
pencil
,
 
the
part
without
any
lead

<EOS>
"
this
be
really
his
,

Harriet

<EOS>
"
do
not
you
remember
one
morning
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
I
dare
say
you
do
not

one
morning
 
I
forget
exactly
the
day

perhaps
it
be
the
Tuesday
or
Wednesday
before
_
that
_
_
evening

,
he
want
to
make
a
memorandum
in

book

about
spruce

beer

Mr.
Knightley
have
be
tell
him
something
about
brew
spruce
-
beer
,
and
he
want
to
put
it
down
;
but
when
he
take
out
his
pencil

there
be
so
little
lead
that
he
soon
cut
it
all
away

it
would
not

so
you
lend
him
another
,

this
be
leave
upon

good
for
nothing

I
keep
my
eye
on
it

,
as
soon

it
up

never

with
it
again

that
moment

I
do

I

yes

Mr.

It
be
very

I

"
and
when
,

Emma
,
"
will
there
be
a
beginning
of
Mr.
Churchill

"
  
<EOS>
She
have
soon
afterwards
reason
to
believe
that
the
beginning
be
already
make
,
and
could
not
but
hope
that
the
gipsy
,
though
she
have
_
tell
_
no
fortune
,
<EOS>
may
be
prove
to
have
make
Harriet
's
.
 
<EOS>
about
a
fortnight
after
the
alarm
,
they
come
to
a
sufficient
explanation
,
and
quite
undesignedly
.
<EOS>
Emma
be
not
think
of
it
at
the
moment
,
which
make
the
information
she
receive
more
valuable
.
<EOS>
She
merely
say
,
in
the
course
of
some
trivial
chat
,
"
well
,
Harriet
,
whenever
you
marry
I
would
advise
you
to
do
so
<EOS>
and
so
"
 
and
think
no
more
of
it
,
till
after
a
minute
's
silence
she
hear
Harriet
say
in
a
very
serious
tone
,
"
I
shall
never
marry
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
then
look
up
,
and
immediately
see
how
it
be
;
and
after
a
moment
's
debate
,
as
to
whether
it
should
pass
unnoticed
or
not
,
reply
,
  
"
never
marry
!
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
new
resolution
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
one
that
I
shall
never
change
,
however
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
another
short
hesitation
,
"
I
hope
it
do
not
proceed
from
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
be
not
in
compliment
to
Mr.
Elton

"
Mr.
Elton
indeed
!

<EOS>
cry
Harriet
indignantly

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
no
"
 
and
Emma
could
just
catch
the
word
,
"
so
superior
to
Mr.
Elton
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
then
take
a
long
time
for
consideration
.
<EOS>
Should
she
proceed
no
farther
?
 
<EOS>
should
she
let
it
pass
,
and
seem
to
suspect
nothing
?
 
<EOS>
perhaps
Harriet
may
think
her
cold
or
angry
if
she
do
;
or
perhaps
if
she
be
totally
silent
,
it
may
only
drive
Harriet
into
ask
her
to
hear
too
much
;
and
against
any
thing
like
such
an
unreserve
as
have
be
,
such
an
open
and
frequent
discussion
of
hope
and
chance
,
she
be
perfectly
resolve
.
 
<EOS>
She
believe
it
would
be
wise
for
her
to
say
and
know
at
once
,
all
that
she
mean
to
say
and
know
.
<EOS>
plain
dealing
be
always
good
.
<EOS>
She
have
previously
determine
how
far
she
would
proceed
,
on
any
application
of
the
sort
;
and
it
would
be
safe
for
both
,
to
have
the
judicious
law
of
her
own
brain
lay
down
with
speed
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
decide
,

thus
speak
    
<EOS>
"
Harriet
,
I
will
not
affect
to
be
in
doubt
of
your
meaning
.
<EOS>
Your
resolution
,
or
rather
your
expectation
of
never
marry
,
result
from
an
idea
that
the
person
whom
you
may
prefer
,
would
be
too
greatly
your
superior
in
situation
to
think
of
you
.

be
not
it
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
oh
!
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
believe
me
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
presumption
to
suppose
  
<EOS>
indeed
I
be
not
so
mad
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
a
pleasure
to
me
to
admire
him
at
a
distance
 
and
to
think
of
his
infinite
superiority
to
all
the
rest
of
the
world
,
with
the
gratitude
,
wonder
,
and
veneration
,
which
be
so
proper

in
me

I
be
not
at

surprize

you

the
service

you

enough

warm
your

Mr.

to
dislike

more

He

to
suspect

of

double
dealing

<EOS>
that
Emma
be
his
object
appear
indisputable
.
<EOS>
every

Mr.

begin

some
inclination
to
trifle
with
Jane
Fairfax

<EOS>
He
could
not
understand
it
;
but
there
be
symptom
of
intelligence
between
them
 
<EOS>
he
think
so
at
least
 
symptom
of
admiration
on
his
side

which
,
have
once
observe
,
he
could
not
persuade
himself
to
think
entirely
void

he
may
wish
to

any
of
Emma

error

He

at

he
have
see
a
look

more
than
a

at
Miss

which
,
from
the
admirer
of
Miss

seem
somewhat
out

<EOS>
when
he

again
in

he
could
not

remember
what
he
have

unless
it

like
Cowper

his
fire
at
twilight
,
  
"
Myself

what
I

him

strong
suspicion
of
there
be
a
something
of
private
liking
,
of
private
understanding
even
,
between
Frank
Churchill

He
have

it

Mr.

if
I

question
about
it

I
must
acknowledge
that
there
be
such
an
idea
last

for
Mrs.

herself
mention
it
to
my
mother
,

the
Coles
know
of
it
as
well

it

quite
a
secret

know
to
nobody

of
about
three
day

very
anxious
that
he
should
have
a
carriage

come
to
my

she
have
mention
it
to
her
in
confidence

she
have
no
objection
to
her
tell
us

of
course

it
be
not

go
beyond

from

Harriet

eager

She

him
for

<EOS>
the

and
as
Harriet
exultingly
proclaim
it
,
there
be
a
blush
on
Jane
's
cheek
which
give
it
a
meaning
not
otherwise
ostensible
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
connect
it
with
the
dream
;
but
how
it
could
all
be
,
be
beyond
his
comprehension
.
<EOS>
how
the
delicacy
,
the
discretion
of
his
favourite
could
have
be
so
lain
asleep
!
<EOS>
He
fear
there
must
be
some

<EOS>
disingenuousness
and
double
dealing
seem
to
meet
him
at
every
turn

<EOS>
these
letter

the
vehicle
for
gallantry

<EOS>
It
be
a
child

play
,
choose
to
conceal
a
deep
game
on
Frank
Churchill

part

<EOS>
with
great
indignation
do
he
continue
to
observe
him
;
with
great
alarm
and
distrust
,
to
observe
also
his
two
blinded
companion

<EOS>
He
see
a
short
word
prepare
for
Emma
,
and
give
to
her
with
a
look
sly
and
demure
.
<EOS>
He
see
that
Emma
have
soon
make
it
out
,
and
find
it
highly
entertaining
,
though
it
be
something
which
she
judge
it
proper
to
appear
to
censure
;
for
she

"
Nonsense

for

<EOS>
He
hear
Frank

next
say

"
I
will
give

I

as
clearly

it
with
eager

no

you

It

<EOS>
this

who
seem

without
complaisance

hand
over
the
word
to
Miss
Fairfax
,
and
with
a
particular
degree
of
sedate
civility
entreat
her
to
study
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
's
excessive
curiosity
to
know
what
this
word
may
be

make
him
seize
every
possible

dart
his
eye
towards
it

it

<EOS>
Jane
Fairfax

her

of
those
five

<EOS>
She
be
evidently
displeased

look
up

Her

<EOS>
Jane

alertness

her

<EOS>
She
be
immediately
up

and
want
to
quit
the

;
but
so
many
be
also
move

that
she
could
not

away

and
Mr.
Knightley
think
he
see
another
collection
of
letter
anxiously
push
towards
her

and
resolutely
sweep
away
by
her
unexamined

She

also
 
it

the

confusion

how

Mr.

could
not
tell

<EOS>
He
remain
at
Hartfield
after
all
the
rest

his
thought
full
of
what

so
full
,
that
when
the
candle
come
to
assist
his
observation
,
he
must
 
<EOS>
yes
,
he
certainly
must
,
as
a
friend
 
an
anxious
friend
 
give
Emma
some
hint
,
ask
her
some
question
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
see
her
in
a
situation
of
such
danger
,
without
try

preserve
her

<EOS>
It
be
his
duty

<EOS>

Pray

may
I

the

Miss
Fairfax

<EOS>
I
see
the
word
,
and
be
curious
to
know
how
it
could
be
so
very
entertaining
to
the
one

and
so
very
distressing
to
the
other

<EOS>
Emma
be
extremely
confused

<EOS>
She
could
not
endure
to
give
him
the
true
explanation
;
for
though
her
suspicion
be
by
no

she
be
really
ashamed

have
ever
impart
them

<EOS>
"
oh

"
she
cry
in
evident
embarrassment

"
it
all

nothing

a

the

he

gravely

"

<EOS>
He
have
hope
she
would
speak
again

but
she
do
not

<EOS>
She
would
rather
busy
herself
about
any

a

fruitless

the

seem
to
declare
her

<EOS>
yet
he
would
speak

<EOS>
He
owe
it
to
her
,
to
risk
any
thing
that
may
be
involve
in
an
unwelcome
interference
,
rather
than
her
welfare

to
encounter
any

rather

the

such
a

it

there
be
no

I
do
assure
you

the
appearance
which
have
catch

have
arise
from
some
peculiar

rather
of
a
totally
different
nature
 
<EOS>
it
be
impossible
exactly
to

there

a
good

nonsense

the
part
which

which

be
,
that
they

<EOS>
She
speak
with
a
confidence
which
stagger
,
with
a
satisfaction
which
silence

Mr.
Knightley

<EOS>
She
be
in
gay
spirit

would
have
prolong
the

want

the

every

all
the
where

how

of
a

which
highly
entertain
her

but
his
gaiety
do
not

her

<EOS>
He
find
he
could
not
be
useful
,
and
his
feeling
be
too
much
irritated
for
talk

<EOS>
that
he
may
not
be
irritate
into
an
absolute
fever
,
by
the
fire
which
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
tender
habit
require
almost
every
evening
throughout
the
year

he
soon
afterwards
take
a
hasty
leave

walk
home
to
the
coolness

solitude
of
Donwell
Abbey

after

feed
with

a
speedy
visit
from
Mr.

the
Highbury
world
be
oblige
to
endure
the
mortification
of
hear
that
they
could
not
possibly
come
till
the
autumn
.
<EOS>
no
such
importation
of
novelty
could
enrich
their
intellectual
store
at
present

<EOS>
in
the
daily
interchange
of
news

they
must
be
again
restrict
to
the
other
topic
with
which
for
a
while
the
suckling

come
have
be
unite

such
as
the
last
account
of
Mrs.
Churchill
,
whose
health
seem
every
day
to

a
different
report

and
the
situation

Mrs.

whose
happiness
it

may
eventually
be
as
much
increase
by
the
arrival

Mrs.

be
very
much
disappointed

<EOS>
It
be
the
delay
of
a
great
deal
of
pleasure

parade

<EOS>
Her
introduction
and
recommendation
must
all
wait
,
and
every
project
party
be
still
only
talk
of
.
<EOS>
so
she
think
at
first
;
 
but
a
little
consideration
convince
her
that
every
thing
nee
not
be
put
off
.
<EOS>
why
should
not
they
explore
to
Box
Hill
though
the
suckling
do
not
come
?
<EOS>
They
could
go
there
again
with
them
in
the
autumn
.
<EOS>
It
be
settle
that
they
should
go
to
Box
Hill
.
<EOS>
that
there
be
to
be
such
a
party
have
be
long
generally
know
:
it
have
even
give
the
idea
of
another
.
<EOS>
Emma
have
never
be
to
Box
Hill
;
she
wish
to
see
what
every
body
find
so
well
worth
see
,
and
she
and
Mr.
Weston
have
agree
to
chuse
some
fine
morning
and
drive
thither
.
<EOS>
two
or
three
more
of
the
choose
only
be
to
be
admit
to
join
them
,
and
it
be
to
be
do
in
a
quiet
,
unpretending
,
elegant
way
,
infinitely
superior
to
the
bustle
and
preparation
,
the
regular
eating
and
drink
,
and
picnic
parade
of
the
Eltons
and
the
suckling
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
so
very
well
understand
between
them
,
that
Emma
could
not
but
feel
some
surprise
,
and
a
little
displeasure
,
on
hearing
from
Mr.
Weston
that
he
have
be
propose
to
Mrs.
Elton
,
as
her
brother
and
sister
have
fail
her
,
that
the
two
party
should
unite
,
and
go
together
;
and
that
as
Mrs.
Elton
have
very
readily
accede
to
it
,
so
it
be
to
be
,
if
she
have
no
objection
.
<EOS>
now
,
as
her
objection
be
nothing
but
her
very
great
dislike
of
Mrs.
Elton
,
of
which
Mr.
Weston
must
already
be
perfectly
aware
,
it
be
not
worth
bring
forward
again
:
 
it
could
not
be
do
without
a
reproof
to
him
,
which
would
be
give
pain
to
his
wife
;
and
she
find
herself
therefore
oblige
to
consent
to
an
arrangement
which
she
would
have
do
a
great
deal
to
avoid
;
an
arrangement
which
would
probably
expose
her
even
to
the
degradation
of
be
say
to
be
of
Mrs.
Elton
's
party
!
<EOS>
every
feeling
be
offend
;
and
the
forbearance
of
her
outward
submission
leave
a
heavy
arrear
due
of
secret
severity
in
her
reflection
on
the
unmanageable
goodwill
of
Mr.
Weston
's
temper
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
you
approve
of
what
I
have
do
,
"
say
he
very
comfortably
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
think
you
would
.
<EOS>
such
scheme
as
these
be
nothing
without
number
.
<EOS>
one
can
not
have
too
large
a
party
.
<EOS>
a
large
party
secure
its
own
amusement
.
<EOS>
and
she
be
a
good
-
natured
woman
after
all
.
<EOS>
one
could
not
leave
her
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
deny
none
of
it
aloud
,
and
agree
to
none
of
it
in
private
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
the
middle
of
June
,
and
the
weather
fine
;
and
Mrs.
Elton
be
grow
impatient
to
name
the
day
,
and
settle
with
Mr.
Weston
as
to
pigeon
-
pie
and
cold
lamb
,
when
a
lame
carriage
-
horse
throw
every
thing
into
sad
uncertainty
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
week
,
it
may
be
only
a
few
day
,
before
the
horse
be
useable
;
but
no
preparation
could
be
venture
on
,
and
it
be
all
melancholy
stagnation
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Elton
's
resource
be
inadequate
to
such
an
attack
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
not
this
most
vexatious
,
Knightley
?
"
<EOS>
she
cry
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
such
weather
for
explore
!
 
<EOS>
these
delay
and
disappointment
be
quite
odious
.
<EOS>
what
be
we
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
the
year
will
wear
away
at
this
rate
,
and
nothing
do
.
<EOS>
before
this
time
last
year
I
assure
you
we
have
have
a
delightful
explore
party
from
Maple
Grove
to
Kings
Weston

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
explore
to
Donwell
,
"
reply
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
"
that
may
be
do
without
horse
.
<EOS>
come
,
and
eat
my
strawberry
.
<EOS>
They
be
ripen
fast
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Knightley
do
not
begin
seriously
,
he
be
oblige
to
proceed
so
,
for
his
proposal
be
catch
at
with
delight
;
and
the
"
oh
!
I
should
like
it
of
all
thing
,
"
be
not
plainer
in
word
than
manner
.
<EOS>
Donwell
be
famous
for
its
strawberry
-
bed
,
which
seem
a
plea
for
the
invitation
:
but
no
plea
be
necessary
;
cabbage
-
bed
would
have
be
enough
to
tempt
the
lady
,
who
only
want
to
be
go
somewhere
.
<EOS>
She
promise
him
again
and
again
to
come
 
much
oftener
than
he
doubt
 
and
be
extremely
gratify
by
such
a
proof
of
intimacy
,

whatever
else
you

provide

it

to
be
all
out

spread

simple

not

My
idea

the
simple

natural
will
be
to
have
the
table
spread

dining

room

<EOS>
the
nature

the
simplicity
of
gentleman

,
with

servant

I
think
be
best
observe
by
meal
within

<EOS>
when
you
be
tired
of
eat
strawberry
in

garden
,
there
shall
be
cold
meat

can
I

be

Knightley

<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
have
another
reason
for
avoid
a
table
in
the
shade

<EOS>
He
wish
to
persuade
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
as
well
as
Emma

to
join
the
party
;
and
he
know
that
to
have
any
of
them
sit
down
out
of
door
to
eat
would
inevitably
make
him
ill

Mr.

must
not

under

specious
pretence

a
morning
drive

an
hour

two
spend
at

some

He
do

a
proof
of
approbation

Mr.

It

<EOS>
Mr.

<EOS>
It

an
odd
tete
-
a

tete
;
but
she
be
glad
to
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
time
when
he
would
have
scorn
her
as
a
companion
,
and
turn
from
her
with
little
ceremony
.
<EOS>
now
they
seem
in
pleasant
conversation

<EOS>
there
have
be
a
time
also
when
Emma
would
have
be
sorry
to
see
Harriet
in
a
spot
so
favourable
for
the
Abbey
Mill
Farm

but
now
she
fear
it
not

<EOS>
It
may
be
safely

beauty

its

<EOS>
She

<EOS>
She

It

His

I

I
have
say

It

some
to

<EOS>
till

when

<EOS>

seem
to
burst

Mrs.

the

He

a

he

Emma
listen

soon
perceive
that
Frank
Churchill

may
be
best
define
by
the
expressive
phrase
of
be
out

humour
.
<EOS>
some
people
be
always
cross
when
they
be
hot

<EOS>
such
may
be
his
constitution

as
she
know
that
eat
and
drinking
be
often
the
cure
of
such
incidental
complaint

she
recommend
his
take
some
refreshment

he
would
find
abundance
of
every

in

Emma

smile

nothing
less
than
a
summon
from

be
to
take
him
back
before
the
follow
evening

<EOS>
They
have
a
very
fine
day
for
Box
Hill

all
the
other
outward
circumstance

arrangement
,
accommodation

punctuality

be
in

pleasant
party

Mr.

direct
the
whole

officiate
safely
between
Hartfield

the
Vicarage

every

be
in
good
time

Emma

Harriet
go
together
;
Miss
Bates
and
her
niece
,
with
the
elton
;
the
gentleman
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
remain
with
Mr.
Woodhouse
.
<EOS>
nothing
be
want
but
to
be
happy
when
they
get
there
.
<EOS>
seven
mile
be
travel
in
expectation
of
enjoyment
,
and
every
body
have
a
burst
of
admiration
on
first
arriving
;
but
in
the
general
amount
of
the
day
there
be
deficiency
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
languor
,
a
want
of
spirit
,
a
want
of
union
,
which
could
not
be
get
over
.
<EOS>
They
separate
too
much
into
party
.
<EOS>
the
elton
walk
together
;
Mr.
Knightley
take
charge
of
Miss
Bates
and
Jane
;
and
Emma
and
Harriet
belong
to
Frank
Churchill
.
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Weston
try
,
in
vain
,
to
make
them
harmonise
better
.
<EOS>
It
seem
at
first
an
accidental
division
,
but
it
never
materially
varied
.
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Elton
,
indeed
,
shew
no
unwillingness
to
mix
,
and
be
as
agreeable
as
they
could
;
but
during
the
two
whole
hour
that
be
spend
on
the
hill
,
there
seem
a
principle
of
separation
,
between
the
other
party
,
too
strong
for
any
fine
prospect
,
or
any
cold
collation
,
or
any
cheerful
Mr.
Weston
,
to
remove
.
  
<EOS>
at
first
it
be
downright
dulness
to
Emma
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
see
Frank
Churchill
so
silent
and
stupid
.
<EOS>
He
say
nothing
worth
hearing
 
look
without
see
 
admire
without
intelligence
 
listen
without
know
what
she
say
.
<EOS>
while
he
be
so
dull
,
it
be
no
wonder
that
Harriet
should
be
dull
likewise
;
and
they
be
both
insufferable
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
all
sit
down
it
be
well
;
to
her
taste
a
great
deal
better
,
for
Frank
Churchill
<EOS>
grow
talkative
and
gay
,
make
her
his
first
object
.
<EOS>
every
distinguish
attention
that
could
be
pay
,
be
pay
to
her
.
<EOS>
to
amuse
her
,
and
be
agreeable
in
her
eye
,
seem
all
that
he
care
for
 
and
Emma
,
glad
to
be
enliven
,
not
sorry
to
be
flatter
,
be
gay
and
easy
too
,
and
give
him
all
the
friendly
encouragement
,
the
admission
to
be
gallant
,
which
she
have
ever
give
in
the
first
and
most
animate
period
of
their
acquaintance
;
but
which
now
,
in
her
own
estimation
,
mean
nothing
,
though
in
the
judgment
of
most
people
look
on
it
must
have
have
such
an
appearance
as
no
english
word
but
flirtation
could
very
well
describe
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
and
Miss
Woodhouse
flirt
together
excessively
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
lay
themselves
open
to
that
very
phrase
 
and
to
have
it
send
off
in
a
letter
to
Maple
Grove
by
one
lady
,
to
Ireland
by
another
.
<EOS>
not
that
Emma
be
gay
and
thoughtless
from
any
real
felicity
;
it
be
rather
because
she
feel
less
happy
than
she
have
expect
.
<EOS>
She
laugh
because
she
be
disappoint
;
and
though
she
like
him
for
his
attention
,
and
think
them
all
,
whether
in
friendship
,
admiration
,
or
playfulness
,
extremely
judicious
,
they
be
not
win
back
her
heart

Understanding

It

Emma
find
a

to
laugh
at

in
it

so
do
Frank

Harriet

It
do
not

some

very

Mr.

gravely
say

this
explain
the

Mr.

<EOS>
I
must
,
I
will
tell
you
truth
while
I
can

"
<EOS>
Miss
Bates
should
never
again
 
no
,
never
!
<EOS>
if
attention
,
in
future
,
could
do
away
the
past
,
she
may
hope
to
be
forgive
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
often
remiss
,
her
conscience
tell
her
so
;
remiss
,
perhaps
,
more
in
thought
than
fact
;
scornful
,
ungracious
.
<EOS>
but
it
should
be
so
no
more
.
<EOS>
in
the
warmth
of
true
contrition
,
she
would
call
upon
her
the
very
next
morning
,
and
it
should
be
the
beginning
,
on
her
side
,
of
a
regular
,
equal
,
kindly
intercourse
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
just
as
determine
when
the
morrow
come
,
and
go
early
,
that
nothing
may
prevent
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
unlikely
,
she
think
,
that
she
may
see
Mr.
Knightley
in
her
way
;
or
,
perhaps
,
he
may
come
in
while
she
be
pay
her
visit
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
objection
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
be
ashamed
of
the
appearance
of
the
penitence
,
so
justly
and
truly
hers
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
be
towards
Donwell
as
she
walk
,
but
she
see
him
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
lady
be
all
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
She
have
never
rejoice
at
the
sound
before
,
nor
ever
before
enter
the
passage
,
nor
walk
up
the
stair
,
with
any
wish
of
give
pleasure
,
but
in
confer
obligation
,
or
of
derive
it
,
except
in
subsequent
ridicule
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
bustle
on
her
approach
;
a
good
deal
of
move
and
talk
.
<EOS>
She
hear
Miss
Bates
's
voice
,
something
be
to
be
do
in
a
hurry
;
the
maid
look
frightened
and
awkward
;
hope
she
would
be
pleased
to
wait
a
moment
,
and
then
usher
her
in
too
soon
.
<EOS>
the
aunt
and
niece
seem
both
escape
into
the
adjoining
room
.
<EOS>
Jane
she
have
a
distinct
glimpse
of
,
look
extremely
ill
;
and
,
before
the
door
have
shut
them
out
,
she
hear
Miss
Bates
say
,
"
well
,
my
dear
,
I
shall
_
say
_
you
be
lay
down
upon
the
bed
,
and
I
be
sure
you
be
ill
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
poor
old
Mrs.
Bates
,
civil
and
humble
as
usual
,
look
as
if
she
do
not
quite
understand
what
be
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
Jane
be
not
very
well
,
"
say
she
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
know
;
they
_
tell
_
me
she
be
well
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
my
daughter
will
be
here
presently
,
Miss
Woodhouse
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
find
a
chair
.
<EOS>
I
wish
Hetty
have
not
go
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
little
able
 
<EOS>
have
you
a
chair
,
madam
?
<EOS>
do
you
sit
where
you
like
?
<EOS>
I
be
sure
she
will
be
here
presently
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
seriously
hope
she
would
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
moment
's
fear
of
Miss
Bates
keep
away
from
her
.
<EOS>
but
Miss
Bates
soon
come
 
"
very
happy
and
oblige
"
 
<EOS>
but
Emma
's
conscience
tell
her
that
there
be
not
the
same
cheerful
volubility
as
before
 
less
ease
of
look
and
manner
.
<EOS>
a
very
friendly
inquiry
after
Miss
Fairfax
,
she
hope
,
may
lead
the
way
to
a
return
of
old
feeling
.
<EOS>
the
touch
seem
immediate
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
how
kind
you
be
!
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
have
hear
 
and
be
come
to
give
us
joy
.
<EOS>
this
do
not
seem
much
like
joy
,
indeed
,
in
me
 
(
twinkle
away
a
tear
or
two
)
 
but
it
will
be
very
try
for
us
to
part
with
her
,
after
have
have
her
so
long
,
and
she
have
a
dreadful
headache
just
now
,
write
all
the
morning
:
 
<EOS>
such
long
letter
,
you
know
,
to
be
write
to
Colonel
Campbell
,
and
Mrs.
Dixon
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear

"
say
I
,
"
you
will
blind
yourself
"
 
for
tear
be
in
her
eye
perpetually
.
<EOS>
one
can
not
wonder
,
one
can
not
wonder
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
change
;
and
though
she
be
amazingly
fortunate
 
<EOS>
such
a
situation
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
as
no
young
woman
before
ever
meet
with
on
first
go
out
 
do
not
think
us
ungrateful
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
for
such
surprising
good
fortune
 
(
again
disperse
her
tear
)
 
<EOS>
but
,
poor
dear
soul
!
<EOS>
if
you
be
to
see
what
a
headache
she
have
.
<EOS>
when
one
be
in
great
pain
,
you
know
one
can
not
feel
any
blessing
quite
as
it
may
deserve
.
<EOS>
She
be
as
low
as
possible
.
<EOS>
to
look
at
her
,
nobody
would
think
how
delighted
and
happy
she
be
to
have
secure
such
a
situation
.
<EOS>
You
will
excuse
her
not
come
to
you
 
<EOS>
she
be
not
able
 
<EOS>
she
be
go
into
her
own
room
 
<EOS>
I
want
her
to
lie
down
upon
the
bed
.
<EOS>
"
My

,
"
say
I
,
"
I
shall
say
you

"
but
,
however
,
she
be
not
;
she
be
walk
about
the
room
.
<EOS>
but
,
now
that
she
have
write
her
letter
<EOS>
,
she
say
she
shall
soon
be
well

<EOS>
She
will
be
extremely
sorry
to

your
kindness
will
excuse
her
.
<EOS>
You
be
keep
wait
at
the
door
 
<EOS>
I
be
quite
ashamed
 
<EOS>
but
somehow
there
be
a
little
bustle
 
<EOS>
for
it
so
happen
that
we
have
not
hear
the
knock
,
and
till
you
be
on
the
stair
<EOS>
,
we
do
not
know
any
body
be
come
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
only
Mrs.
Cole
,
"
say
I
,
"
depend
upon
it
.
<EOS>
nobody
else
would
come
so
early

<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
she
,
"
it
must
be
bear
some
time
or
other

it
may
as
well
be
now

but
then
Patty
come
in
,
and
say
it
be
you
.
"
<EOS>
oh
!
"
say
I
,
"
it
be
Miss

I
be
sure
you
will
like
to
see
her

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
see
nobody
,
"
say
she
;
and
up
she
get
,
and
would
go
away
;
and
that
be
what
make
us
keep
you
wait
 
and
extremely
sorry
and
ashamed
we
be
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
must
go

I
,

you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
be
most
sincerely
interested
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
have
be
long
grow
kinder
towards
Jane
;
and
this
picture
of
her
present
suffering
act
as
a
cure
of
every
former
ungenerous
suspicion
,
and
leave
her
nothing
but
pity
;
and
the
remembrance
of
the
less
just
and
less
gentle
sensation
of
the
past
,
oblige
her
to
admit
that
Jane
may
very
naturally
resolve
on
see
Mrs.
Cole
or
any
other
steady
friend
,
when
she
may
not
bear
to
see
herself
.
<EOS>
She
speak
as
she
feel
,
with
earnest
regret
and
solicitude
 
sincerely
wish
that
the
circumstance
which
she
collect
from
Miss
Bates
to
be
now
actually
determine
on
,
may
be
as
much
for
Miss
Fairfax
's
advantage
and
comfort
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
a
severe
trial
to
them
all
.
<EOS>
She
have
understand
it
be
to
be
delay
till
Colonel
Campbell
's
return
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
very
kind
!
"
reply
Miss
Bates
.
<EOS>
"

you
be
always
kind

<EOS>
there
be
no
bearing
such
an

and
to
break
through
her
dreadful
gratitude
,
Emma
make
the
direct
inquiry
of
    
<EOS>
"
where
 
may
I
ask
?
 
<EOS>
be
Miss
Fairfax
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
to
a
Mrs.
Smallridge
 
charming
woman
 
most
superior
 
to
have
the
charge
of
her
three
little
girl
 
delightful
child
.
<EOS>
impossible
that
any
situation
could
be
more
replete
with
comfort
;
if
we
except
,
perhaps
,
Mrs.
Suckling
's
own
family
,
and
Mrs.
Bragge
's
;
but
Mrs.
Smallridge
be
intimate
with
both
,
and
in
the
very
same
neighbourhood
:
 
live
only
four
mile
from
Maple
Grove
.
<EOS>
Jane
will
be
only
four
mile
from
Maple
Grove
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Elton
,
I
suppose
,
have
be
the
person
to
whom
Miss
Fairfax
owe
 
"
  
"
yes
,
our
good
Mrs.
Elton
.
<EOS>
the
most
indefatigable
,
true
friend
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
take
a
denial
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
let
Jane
say
,
"
no
;
"
for
when
Jane
first
hear
of
it
,
(
it
be
the
day
before
yesterday
,
the
very
morning
we
be
at
Donwell
,
)
<EOS>
when
Jane
first
hear
of
it
,
she
be
quite
decide
against
accept
the
offer
,
and
for
the
reason
you
mention
;
exactly
as
you
say
,
she
have
make
up
her
mind
to
close
with
nothing
till
Colonel
Campbell
's
return
,
and
nothing
should
induce
her
to
enter
into
any
engagement
at
present
 
<EOS>
and
so
she
tell
Mrs.
Elton
over
and
over
again
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
sure
I
have
no
more
idea
that
she
would
change
her
mind
!
 
<EOS>
but
that
good
Mrs.
Elton
,
whose
judgment
never
fail
her
,
see
farther
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
every
body
that
would
have
stand
out
in
such
a
kind
way
as
she
do
,
and
refuse
to
take
Jane
's
answer
;
but
she
positively
declare
she
would
_
not
_
write
any
such
denial
yesterday
,
as
Jane
wish
her
;
she
would
wait
 
and
,
sure
enough
,
<EOS>
yesterday
evening
it
be
all
settle
that
Jane
should
go
.
<EOS>
quite
a
surprize
to
me
!
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
least
idea
!
 
<EOS>
Jane
take
Mrs.
Elton
aside
,
and
tell
her
at
once
,
that
upon
think
over
the
advantage
of
Mrs.
Smallridge
's
situation
,
she
have
come
to
the
resolution
of
accept
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
a
word
of
it
till
it
be
all
settle
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
spend
the
evening
with
Mrs.
Elton

upon

<EOS>
"
no

not

he
decline

because
Mrs.

declare
she
would
not

off

he
do
not

there

so
liberal

very

very

My

out

say
,
come

do
not
let

about
it
any
more

<EOS>
"
Her
friend
must
all
be
sorry

not
Colonel

Mrs.
Campbell
be
sorry

find
that
she
have
engage
herself
before

yes

Jane
say
she
be
sure
they
will
;

yet
,
this
be
such
a
situation
as
she
can
not
feel
herself
justified
in
decline
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
astonished
when
she
first
tell
me
what
she
have
be

It

"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Bates
would
hardly
give
Emma
time
to
say
how
perfectly
new
this
circumstance
be
to
her
;
but
as
without
suppose
it
possible
that
she
could
be
ignorant
of
any
of
the
particular
of
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
be
go
,
she
proceed
to
give
them
all
,
it
be
of
no
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
what
Mr.
Elton
have
learn
from
the
ostler
on
the
subject
,
be
the
accumulation
of
the
ostler
's
own
knowledge
,
and
the
knowledge
of
the
servant
at
Randalls
,
be
,
that
a
messenger
have
come
over
from
Richmond
soon
after
the
return
of
the
party
from
Box
Hill
 
<EOS>
which
messenger
,
however
,
have
be
no
more
than
be
expect
;
and
that
Mr.
Churchill
have
send
his
nephew
a
few
line
,
contain
,
upon
the
whole
,
a
tolerable
account
of
Mrs.
Churchill
,
and
only
wish
him
not
to
delay
come
back
beyond
the
next
morning
early
;
but
that
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
have
resolve
to
go
home
directly
,
without
wait
at
all
,
and
his
horse
seem
to
have
get
a
cold
,
Tom
have
be
send
off
immediately
for
the
Crown
chaise
,
and
the
ostler
have
stand
out
and
see
it
pass
by
,
the
boy
go
a
good
pace
,
and
drive
very
steady
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
in
all
this
either
to
astonish
or
interest
,
and
it
catch
Emma
's
attention
only
as
it
unite
with
the
subject
which
already
engage
her
mind
.
<EOS>
the
contrast
between
Mrs.
Churchill
's
importance
in
the
world
,
and
Jane
Fairfax
's
,
strike
her
;
one
be
every
thing
,
the
other
nothing
 
<EOS>
and
she
sit
muse
on
the
difference
of
woman
's
destiny
,
and
quite
unconscious
on
what
her
eye
be
fix
,
till
rouse
by
Miss
Bates
's
saying
,
  
<EOS>
"
aye

I
see

<EOS>
very

<EOS>
poor

"
You

for
me
;
he
will
help
me
out
of
all
my
difficulty

<EOS>
and
to
this
day
,
I
do
believe
,
she
know
not
whether
it
be
his
present
or
his
daughter
's
.
"
  
<EOS>
now
Emma
be
oblige
to
think
of
the
pianoforte
;
and
the
remembrance
of
all
her
former
fanciful
and
unfair
conjecture
be
so
little
pleasing
,
that
she
soon
allow
herself
to
believe
her
visit
have
be
long
enough
;
and
,
with
a
repetition
of
every
thing
that
she
could
venture
to
say
of
the
good
wish
which
she
really
feel
,
take
leave
.
    
<EOS>
Emma
's
pensive
meditation
,
as
she
walk
home
,
be
not
interrupt
;
but
on
enter
the
parlour
,
she
find
those
who
must
rouse
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
and
Harriet
have
arrive
during
her
absence
,
and
be
sit
with
her
father

<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
immediately
get
up
,
and
in
a
manner
decidedly
graver
than
usual

say
,
  
"
I
would
not
go

I

nothing

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes

rather
 
I

some
little
time

<EOS>
Emma
be
sure
he
have
not
forgive
her
;
he
look
unlike
himself
.
<EOS>
time
,
however
,
she
think
,
would
tell
him
that
they
ought
to
be
friend
again
.
<EOS>
while
he
stand
,
as
if
mean
to
go
,
but
not
go
 
her
father
begin
his
inquiry
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my

and
do
you
get
there
safely
?
 
<EOS>
and
how
do

<EOS>
I
dare

they
must
have

very
much
oblige

<EOS>
Dear
Emma
have
be
to
call
on
Mrs.
and
Miss
Bates
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
as
I
tell
you
before
.
<EOS>
She
be
always
so
attentive
to
them
!
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
's
colour
be
heighten
by
this
unjust
praise
;
and
with
a
smile
,
and
shake
of
the
head
,
which
speak
much
,
she
look
at
Mr.
Knightley
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
there
be
an
instantaneous
impression
in
her
favour
,
as
if
his
eye
receive
the
truth
from
hers
,
and
all
that
have
pass
of
good
in
her
feeling
be
at
once
catch
and
honour
.
  
<EOS>
He
look
at
her
with
a
glow
of
regard
.
<EOS>
She
be
warmly
gratify
 
and
in
another
moment
still
more
so
,
by
a
little
movement
of
more
than
common
friendliness
on
his
part
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
her
hand
;
 
whether
she
have
not
herself
make
the
first
motion
<EOS>
,
she
could
not
say
 
<EOS>
she
may
,
perhaps
,
have
rather
offer
it
 
<EOS>
but
he
take
her
hand
,
press
it
,
and
certainly
be
on
the
point
of
carry
it
to
his
lip
 
<EOS>
when
,
from
some
fancy
or
other
,
he
suddenly
let
it
go
.
 
<EOS>
why
he
should
feel
such
a
scruple
,
why
he
should
change
his
mind
when
it
be
all
but
do
,
she
could
not
perceive
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
judge
better
,
she
think
,
if
he
have
not
stop
.
 
<EOS>
the
intention
,
however
,
be
indubitable
;
and
whether
it
be
that
his
manner
have
in
general
so
little
gallantry
,
or
however
else
it
happen
,
but
she
think
nothing
become
him
more
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
with
him
,
of
so
simple
,
yet
so
dignified
a
nature
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
but
recall
the
attempt
with
great
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
It
speak
such
perfect
amity
.
 
<EOS>
He
leave
them
immediately
afterwards
 
go
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
He
always
move
with
the
alertness
of
a
mind
which
could
neither
be
undecided
nor
dilatory
,
but
now
he
seem
more
sudden
than
usual
in
his
disappearance
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
could
not
regret
her
have
go
to
Miss
Bates
,
but
she
wish
she
have
leave
her
ten
minute
earlier
;
 
<EOS>
it
would
have
be
a
great
pleasure
to
talk
over
Jane
Fairfax
's
situation
with
Mr.
Knightley
.
 
<EOS>
neither
<EOS>
would
she
regret
that
he
should
be
go
to
Brunswick
Square
,
for
she
know
how
much
his
visit
would
be
enjoy
 
<EOS>
but
it
may
have
happen
at
a
well
time
 
and
to
have
have
long
notice
of
it
,
would
have
be
pleasanter
.
 
<EOS>
They
part
thorough
friend
,
however
;
she
could
not
be
deceive
as
to
the
meaning
of
his
countenance
,
and
his
unfinished
gallantry
;
 
it
be
all
do
to
assure
her
that
she
have
fully
recover
his
good
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
sit
with
them
half
an
hour
,
she
find
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
that
she
have
not
come
back
earlier
!
  
<EOS>
in
the
hope
of
divert
her
father
's
thought
from
the
disagreeableness
of
Mr.
Knightley
's
go
to
London
;
and
go
so
suddenly
;
and
go
on
horseback
,
which
she
know
would
be
all
very
bad
<EOS>
;
Emma
communicate
her
news
of
Jane
Fairfax
,
and
her
dependence
on
the
effect
be
justify
;
it
supply
a
very
useful
check
,
 
interested
,
without
disturb
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
long
make
up
his
mind
to
Jane
Fairfax
be
go
out
as
governess
,
and
could
talk
of
it
cheerfully

Mr.

unexpected
blow

a
dry
situation

will
be
take
good

It
ought
to

Harriet

good
wish
for
the
future
be
all
that
could
yet
be
possible
on
Emma
's
side
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
more
pressing
concern
to
shew
attention
to
Jane
Fairfax
,
whose
prospect
be
close
,
while
Harriet
's
open
,
and
whose
engagement
now
allow
of
no
delay
in
any
one
at
Highbury
,
who
wish
to
shew
her
kindness
 
and
with
Emma
it
be
grow
into
a
first
wish
.
<EOS>
She
have
scarcely
a
strong
regret
than
for
her
past
coldness
;
and
the
person
,
whom
she
have
be
so
many
month
neglect
,
be
now
the
very
one
on
whom
she
would
have
lavish
every
distinction
of
regard
or
sympathy
.
<EOS>
She
want
to
be
of
use
to
her
;
want
to
shew
a
value
for
her
society
,
and
testify
respect
and
consideration
.
<EOS>
She
resolve
to
prevail
on
her
to
spend
a
day
at
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
a
note
be
write
to
urge
it
.
<EOS>
the
invitation
be
refuse
,
and
by
a
verbal
message
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Fairfax
be
not
well
enough
to
write
;
"
and
when
Mr.
Perry
call
at
Hartfield
,
the
same
morning
,
it
appear
that
she
be
so
much
indispose
as
to
have
be
visit
,
though
against
her
own
consent
,
by
himself
,
and
that
she
be
suffer
under
severe
headache
,
and
a
nervous
fever
to
a
degree
,
which
make
him
doubt
the
possibility
of
her
go
to
Mrs.
Smallridge
's
at
the
time
propose
.
<EOS>
Her
health
seem
for
the
moment
completely
derange
 
appetite
quite
go
 
and
though
there
be
no
absolutely
alarming
symptom
,
nothing
touch
the
pulmonary
complaint
,
which
be
the
stand
apprehension
of
the
family
,
Mr.
Perry
be
uneasy
about
her
.
<EOS>
He
think
she
have
undertake
more
than
she
be
equal
to
,
and
that
she
feel
it
so
herself
,
though
she
would
not
own
it
.
<EOS>
Her
spirit
seem
overcome
.
<EOS>
Her
present
home
,
he
could
not
but
observe
,
be
unfavourable
to
a
nervous
disorder
:
 
confine
always
to
one
room
;
 
he
could
have
wish
it
otherwise
 
and
her
good
aunt
,
though
his
very
old
friend
,
he
must
acknowledge
to
be
not
the
good
companion
for
an
invalid
of
that
description
.
<EOS>
Her
care
and
attention
could
not
be
question
;
they
be
,
in
fact
,
only
too
great
.
<EOS>
He
very
much
fear
that
Miss
Fairfax
derive
more
evil
than
good
from
them
.
<EOS>
Emma
listen
with
the
warm
concern
;
grieve
for
her
more
and
more
,
and
look
around
eager
to
discover
some
way
of
be
useful
.
<EOS>
to
take
her
 
be
it
only
an
hour
or
two
 
from
her
aunt
,
to
give
her
change
of
air
and
scene
,
and
quiet
rational
conversation
,
even
for
an
hour
or
two
,
may
do
her
good
;
and
the
follow
morning
she
write
again
to
say
,
in
the
most
feeling
language
she
could
command
,
that
she
would
call
for
her
in
the
carriage
at
any
hour
that
Jane
would
name
 
mention
that
she
have
Mr.
Perry
's
decide
opinion
,
in
favour
of
such
exercise
for
his
patient
.
<EOS>
the
answer
be
only
in
this
short
note
:
  
"
Miss
Fairfax
's
compliment
and
thank
,
but
be
quite
unequal
to
any
exercise
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
feel
that
her
own
note
have
deserve
something
well
;
but
it
be
impossible
to
quarrel
with
word
,
whose
tremulous
inequality
shew
indisposition
so
plainly
,
and
she
think
only
of
how
she
may
best
counteract
this
unwillingness
to
be
see
or
assist
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
the
answer
,
therefore
,
she
order
the
carriage
,
and
drive
to
Mrs.
Bates
's
,
in
the
hope
that
Jane
would
be
induce
to
join
her
 
<EOS>
but
it
would
not
do
;
 
Miss
Bates
come
to
the
carriage
door
,
all
gratitude
,
and
agree
with
her
most
earnestly
in
think
an
airing
may
be
of
the
great
service
 
and
every
thing
that
message
could
do
be
try
 
but
all
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bates
be
oblige
to
return
without
success
;
Jane
be
quite
unpersuadable
;
the
mere
proposal
of
go
out
seem
to
make
her
bad
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
wish
she
could
have
see
her
,
and
try
her
own
power
;
but
,
almost
before
she
could
hint
the
wish
,
Miss
Bates
make
it
appear
that
she
have
promise
her
niece
on
no
account
to
let
Miss
Woodhouse
in
.
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
truth
be
,
that
poor
dear
Jane
could
not
bear
to
see
any
body
 
any
body
at
all
 
Mrs.
Elton
,
indeed
,
could
not
be
deny
 
and
Mrs.
Cole
have
make
such
a
point
 
and
Mrs.
Perry
have
say
so
much
 
but
,
except
them
,
Jane
would
really
see
nobody
.
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
do
not
want
to
be
class
with
the
Mrs.
Eltons
,
the
Mrs.
Perrys
,
and
the
Mrs.
Coles
,
who
would
force
themselves
anywhere
;
neither
could
she
feel
any
right
of
preference
<EOS>
herself
 
<EOS>
she
submit
,
therefore
,
and
only
question
Miss
Bates
farther
as
to
her
niece
's
appetite
and
diet
,
which
she
long
to
be
able
to
assist
.
<EOS>
on
that
subject
poor
Miss
Bates
be
very
unhappy
,
and
very
communicative
;
Jane
would
hardly
eat
any
thing
:
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Perry
recommend
nourish
food
;
but
every
thing
they
could
command
(
and
never
have
any
body
such
good
neighbour
)
be
distasteful
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
,
on
reach
home
,
call
the
housekeeper
directly
,
to
an
examination
of
her
store
;
and
some
arrowroot
of
very
superior
quality
be
speedily
despatch
to
Miss
Bates
with
a
most
friendly
note
.
<EOS>
in
half
an
hour
the
arrowroot
be
return
,
with
a
thousand
thank
from
Miss
Bates
,
but
"
dear
Jane
would
not
be
satisfied
without
its
being
send
back
;
it
be
a
thing
she
could
not
take
 
<EOS>
and
,
moreover
,
she
insist
on
her
saying
,
that
she
be
not
at
all
in
want
of
any
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
Emma
afterwards
hear
that
Jane
Fairfax
have
be
see
wander
about
the
meadow
,
at
some
distance
from
Highbury
,
on
the
afternoon
of
the
very
day
on
which
she
have
,
under
the
plea
of
be
unequal
to
any
exercise
,
so
peremptorily
refuse
to
go
out
with
her
in
the
carriage
,
she
could
have
no
doubt
 
put
every
thing
together
 
that
Jane
be
resolve
to
receive
no
kindness
from
_
her
_
.
<EOS>
She
be
sorry
,
very
sorry
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
be
grieve
for
a
state
which
seem
but
the
more
pitiable
from
this
sort
of
irritation
of
spirit
,
inconsistency
of
action
,
and
inequality
of
power
;
and
it
mortify
her
that
she
be
give
so
little
credit
for
proper
feeling
,
or
esteem
so
little
worthy
as
a
friend
:
but
she
have
the
consolation
of
know
that
her
intention
be
good
,
and
of
be
able
to
say
to
herself
,
that
could
Mr.
Knightley
have
be
privy
to
all
her
attempt
of
assist
Jane
Fairfax

could
he
even
have

he
would

He

a

"
so
far
as
that
it
relate
to
Mr.

I
do
guess

<EOS>
"
You
be
right

It
do
relate
to
him

I

He
have
be
here
this
very
morning
,
on
a
most
extraordinary
errand
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
express
our
surprize
.
<EOS>
He
come
to
speak
to
his
father
on
a
subject
,
 
to
announce
an
attachment

She
stop
to

first
of
herself

then
of
Harriet

<EOS>
"
More
than
an
attachment
,
indeed
,
"
resume
Mrs.
Weston
;
"
an
engagement
 
a
positive
engagement
.
 
<EOS>
what
will
you
say
,
Emma
 
what
will
any
body
say
,
when
it
be
know
that
Frank
Churchill

Miss
Fairfax

with

You

<EOS>
"
You
may
well
be
amazed

return
Mrs.
Weston
,
still
avert
her
eye
,
and
talk
on
with
eagerness
,
that
Emma
may
have
time
to
recover
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
well
be
amazed

<EOS>
but
it
be
even
so
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
solemn
engagement
between
them
ever
since
October
 
form
at
Weymouth
,
and
keep
a
secret
from
every
body
.
<EOS>
not
a
creature
know
it
<EOS>
but
themselves
 
<EOS>
neither
the
Campbells
,
nor
her
family
,
nor
his
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
wonderful
,
that
though
perfectly
convince
of
the
fact
,
it
be
yet
almost
incredible
to
myself
.
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
believe
it

<EOS>
I
think
I
know
him

"
  
<EOS>
Emma
scarcely
hear
what
be

<EOS>
Her
mind
be
divide
between
two
idea
 
her
own
former
conversation
with
him
about
Miss
Fairfax
;
and
poor
Harriet
;
 
and
for
some
time
she
could
only
exclaim
,
and
require
confirmation
,
repeat
confirmation
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
she
at
last
,
try
to
recover
herself
;
"
this
be
a
circumstance
which
I
must
think
of
at

half
a
day

before
I
can
at
all

it

<EOS>
what

It

hurt
me

very
much

It
have
hurt
his
father
equally

some

part

of

conduct

can
not

"
  
<EOS>
Emma
ponder
a
moment
,
and
then
reply
,
"
I
will
not
pretend
_
not
_
to
understand
you
;
and
to
give
you
all
the
relief
in
my
power

be
assure
that
no
such
effect

follow
his
attention
to
me

as
you
be
apprehensive
of
.

"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
look
up
,
afraid
to
believe
;
but
Emma
's
countenance
be
as
steady
as
her
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
you
may
have
less
difficulty
in
believe
this
boast
,
of
my
present
perfect
indifference
,
"
she
continue
,
"
I
will
farther
tell
you
,
that
there
be
a
period
in
the
early
part
of
our
acquaintance
,
when
I
do
like
him
,
when
I
be
very
much
disposed
to
be
attach
to
him
 
<EOS>
nay
,
be
attach
 
and
<EOS>
how
it
come
to
cease
,
be
perhaps
the
wonder
.
<EOS>
fortunately
,
however
,
it
do
cease
.
<EOS>
I
have
really
for
some
time
past
,
for
at
least
these
three
month
,
care
nothing
about
him
.
<EOS>
You
may
believe
me
,
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
simple
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
kiss
her
with
tear
of
joy
;
and
when
she
could
find
utterance
,
assure
her
,
that
this
protestation
have
do
her
more
good
than
any
thing
else
in
the
world
could
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Weston
will
be
almost
as
much
relieved
as
myself
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
on
this
point
we
have
be
wretched
.
<EOS>
It
be
our
darling
wish
that
you
may
be
attach
to
each
other
 
and
we
be
persuade
that
it
be
so
.
  
<EOS>
imagine
what
we
have
be
feel
on
your
account
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
escape
;
and
that
I
should
escape
,
may
be
a
matter
of
grateful
wonder
to
you
and
myself
.
<EOS>
but
this
do
not
acquit
_
him
_
,
Mrs.
Weston
;
and
I
must
say
,
that
I
think
him
greatly
to
blame
.
<EOS>
what
right
have
he
to
come
among
us
with
affection
and
faith
engage
,
and
with
manner
<EOS>
so
_
very
_
disengage
?
<EOS>
what
right
have
he
to
endeavour
to
please
,
as
he
certainly
do
 
to
distinguish
any
one
young
woman
with
persevere
attention
,
as
he
certainly
do
 
while
he
really
belong
to
another
?
 
<EOS>
how
could
he
tell
what
mischief
he
may
be
do
?
 
<EOS>
how
could
he
tell
that
he
may
not
be
make
me
in
love
with
him
?
 
<EOS>
very
wrong
,
very
wrong
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
from
something
that
he
say
,
my
dear
Emma
,
I
rather
imagine
 
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
how
could
_
she
<EOS>
_
bear
such
behaviour
!
<EOS>
composure
with
a
witness
!
<EOS>
to
look
on
,
while
repeat
attention
be
offer
to
another
woman
,
before
her
face
,
and
not
resent
it
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
a
degree
of
placidity
,
which
I
can
neither
comprehend
nor
respect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
misunderstanding
between
them
,
Emma
;
he
say
so
expressly
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
time
to
enter
into
much
explanation
.
<EOS>
He
be
here
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
in
a
state
of
agitation
which
do
not
allow
the
full
use
even
of
the
time
he
could
stay
 
but
that
there
have
be
misunderstanding
he
decidedly
say
.
<EOS>
the
present
crisis
,
indeed
,
seem
to
be
bring
on
by
them
;
and
those
misunderstanding
may
very
possibly
arise
from
the
impropriety
of
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
impropriety
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
 
<EOS>
it
be
too
calm
a
censure
.
<EOS>
much
,
much
beyond
impropriety
!
 
<EOS>
It
have
sink
him
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
say
how
it
have
sink
him
in
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
so
unlike
what
a
man
should
be
!
 
<EOS>
none
of
that
upright
integrity
,
that
strict
adherence
to
truth
and
principle
,
that
disdain
of
trick
and
littleness
,
which
a
man
should
display
in
every
transaction
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
dear
Emma
,
now
I
must
take
his
part
;
for
though
he
have
be
wrong
in
this
instance
,
I
have
know
him
long
enough
to
answer
for
his
have
many

very
many
,
good
quality

and

"
good
God

cry
Emma
,
not
attend
to
her
.

"
Mrs.
Smallridge
,
too
!
<EOS>
Jane
actually
on
the
point
of
go
as
governess
!
<EOS>
what
could
he
mean
by
such
horrible
indelicacy
?
<EOS>
to
suffer
her
to
engage
herself
 
to
suffer
her
even
to

of
such
a
measure

"
  
<EOS>
"
He
know
nothing
about
it
,
Emma
.
<EOS>
on
this
article
I
can
fully
acquit
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
private
resolution
of
her
,
not
communicate
to
him
 
or
at
least
not
communicate
in
a
way
to
carry
conviction

<EOS>
till
yesterday
,
I
know
he
say
he
be
in
the
dark
as
to
her
plan
.
<EOS>
They
burst
on
him
,
I
do
not
know
how
,
but
by
some
letter
or
message
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
the
discovery
of
what
she
be
do
,
of
this
very
project
of
her
,
which
determine
him
to
come
forward
at
once
,
own
it
all
to
his
uncle
,
throw
himself
on
his
kindness
,
and
,
in
short
,
put
an
end
to
the
miserable
state
of
concealment
that
have
be
carry
on
so
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
begin
to
listen
better
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
to
hear
from
him
soon
,
"
continue
Mrs.
Weston
.
"
<EOS>
He
tell
me
at
parting
,
that
he
should
soon
write
;
and
he
speak
in
a
manner
which
seem
to
promise
me
many
particular
that
could
not
be
give
now
.
<EOS>
let
us
wait
,
therefore
,
for
this
letter
.
<EOS>
It
may
bring
many
extenuation
.
<EOS>
It
may
make
many
thing
intelligible
and
excusable
which
now
be
not
to
be
understand
.
<EOS>
do
not
let
us
be
severe
,
do
not
let
us
be
in
a
hurry
to
condemn
him
.
<EOS>
let
us
have
patience
.
<EOS>
I
must
love
him
;
and
now
that
I
be
satisfied
on
one
point
,
the
one
material
point
,
I
be
sincerely
anxious
for
its
all
turn
out
well
,
and
ready
to
hope
that
it
may
.
<EOS>
They
must
both
have
suffer
a
great
deal
under
such
a
system
of
secresy
and
concealment

<EOS>

_
His

suffering

"
reply
Emma
dryly
,
"
do
not
appear
to
have
do
him
much
harm

well
,

how
do
Mr.
Churchill
take
it
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
most
favourably
for
his
nephew
 
give
his
consent
with
scarcely
a
difficulty

<EOS>
conceive
what
the
event
of
a
week
have
do
in
that
family
!
<EOS>
while
poor
Mrs.
Churchill
live
,
I
suppose
there
could
not

a
chance

what
a
blessing
it
be

when
undue
influence

his

very
little
persuasion

ah
!

Emma

he
would
have
do
as
much
for
Harriet

this
be
settle
last
night

Frank
be
off
with
the
light
this
morning

<EOS>
He
stop
at
Highbury
,
at
the
Bates
's
,
I
fancy
,
some
time
 
<EOS>
and
then
come
on
hither
;
but
be
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
back
to
his
uncle
,
to
whom
he
be
just
now
more
necessary
than
ever
,
that
,
as
I
tell
you
,
he
could
stay
with
us

a
quarter
of
an
hour

<EOS>
He
be
very
much
agitate
 
very
much
,
indeed
 
to
a
degree
that
make
him
appear
quite
a
different
creature
from
any
thing
I
have
ever
see
him
before
.
 
<EOS>
in
addition
to
all
the
rest
,
there
have
be
the
shock
of
find
her
so
very
unwell
,
which
he
have
have
no
previous
suspicion

there
be
every
appearance
of
his
have
be
feel
a
great
deal

do
you
really
believe
the
affair
to
have

on
with
such
perfect
secresy

the
Campbells

Dixons

the
name

Dixon

a
little
blush

none

not
one

He
positively
say
that

no

their
two

"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Emma
,
"
I
suppose
we
shall
gradually
grow
reconcile
to
the
idea
,
and
I
wish
them
very
happy
.
<EOS>
but
I
shall
always
think
it
a
very
abominable
sort

proceeding

what
have
it
be

a
system

hypocrisy

deceit

treachery

to
come
among

profession

openness

simplicity

such
a
league
in
secret
to
judge
us
all
!

here
have
we
be
,
the
whole
winter
and
spring

completely
dupe
,
fancy
ourselves
all
on
an
equal
footing
of
truth
and
honour

with
two
people
in
the
midst
of
us
who
may
have
be
carry
round
,
compare
and
sit
in
judgment
on
sentiment

word
that
be
never
mean
for
both
to
hear

<EOS>
They
must
take
the
consequence
,
if
they
have
hear
each
other
spoken
of
in
a
way
not
perfectly
agreeable
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
quite
easy
on
that
head
,
"
reply
Mrs.
Weston
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
sure
that
I
never
say
any
thing

either

luck

Your
only
blunder

you
imagine
a
certain
friend
of
ours
in
love
with
the
lady

<EOS>
"
true
.
<EOS>
but
as
I
have
always
have
a
thoroughly
good
opinion
of
Miss
Fairfax

I
never
could
,
under
any
blunder
,
have
speak
ill
of
her
;

as
to
speak
ill
of
him
,
there
I
must
have
be
safe

"
  
<EOS>
at
this
moment
Mr.
Weston
appear
at
a
little
distance
from
the
window
,
evidently
on
the
watch
.
<EOS>
His
wife
give
him
a
look
which
invite
him
in
;
and
,
while
he
be
come
round
,
add
,
"
<EOS>
now
,
dear
Emma
,
let
me
intreat
you
to
say
and
look
every
thing
that
may
set
his
heart
at
ease
,
and
incline
him
to
be
satisfied
with
the
match
.
<EOS>
let
us
make
the
good
of
it
 
and
,
indeed
,
almost
every
thing
may
be
fairly
say
in
her
favour
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
connexion
to
gratify
;
but
if
Mr.
Churchill
do
not
feel
that
,
why
should
we
?
<EOS>
and
it
may
be
a
very
fortunate
circumstance
for
him
,
for
Frank
,
I
mean
,
that
he
should
have
attach
himself
to
a
girl
of
such
steadiness
of
character
and
good
judgment
as
I
have
always
give
her
credit
for
 
and
still
be
disposed
to
give
her
credit
for
,

my

you
really
frighten

I
congratulate
you

Mr.

with
all
my

on
the
prospect

a
glance
or
two
between

his

convince
him
that
all
be
as
right
as
this
speech
proclaim
;
and
its
happy
effect
on
his
spirit
be
immediate
.
<EOS>
His
air
and
voice
recover
their
usual
briskness
:
he
shake
her
heartily
and
gratefully
by
the
hand
,
and
enter
on
the
subject
in
a
manner
to
prove
,
that
he
now
only
want
time
and
persuasion
to
think
the
engagement
no
very
bad
thing

<EOS>
His
companion
suggest
only
what
could
palliate
imprudence
,

smooth
objection
;

by
the

have
talk
it
all
over
again
with

in
their
walk
back
to
Hartfield

he
be
become
perfectly
reconcile

not

from
think
it
the
very
good
thing
that
Frank

possibly
have
do

<EOS>
"
Harriet
,
poor
Harriet

"
 
<EOS>
those
be
the
word

in
them
lie
the
torment
idea
which
Emma
could
not
get
rid
of
,
and
which
constitute
the
real
misery
of
the
business
to
her
.
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
have
behave
very
ill
by
herself
 
very
ill
in
many
way
,

it
be
not
so
much
_
<EOS>
his
_
behaviour
as
her
<EOS>
_
own
_
,
which
make
her
so
angry
with
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
scrape
which
he
have
draw
her
into
on
Harriet
's
account
,
that
give
the
deep
hue
to
his
offence
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Harriet
!
<EOS>
to
be
a
second
time
the
dupe
of
her
misconception
and
flattery
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
have
speak
prophetically
,
when
he
once
say
,
"
emma
,
you
have
be
no
friend
to
Harriet
Smith
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
be
afraid
she
have
do
her
nothing
but
disservice
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
she
have
not
to
charge
herself
,
in
this
instance
as
in
the
former
,
with
be
the
sole
and
original
author
of
the
mischief
;
with
have
suggest
such
feeling
as
may
otherwise
never
have
enter
Harriet
's
imagination
;
for
Harriet
have
acknowledge
her
admiration
and
preference
of
Frank
Churchill
before
she
have
ever
give
her
a
hint
on
the
subject
;
but
she
feel
completely
guilty
of
have
encourage
what
she
may
have
repress
.
<EOS>
She
may
have
prevent
the
indulgence
and
increase
of
such
sentiment
.
<EOS>
Her
influence
would
have
be
enough
.
<EOS>
and
now
she
be
very
conscious
that
she
ought
to
have
prevent
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
feel
that
she
have
be
risk
her
friend
's
happiness
on
most
insufficient
ground
.
<EOS>
common
sense
would
have
direct
her
to
tell
Harriet
,
that
she
must
not
allow
herself
to
think
of
him
,
and
that
there
be
five
hundred
chance
to
one
against
his
ever
care
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
with
common
sense
,
"
she
add
,
"
I
be
afraid
I
have
have
little
to
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
extremely
angry
with
herself
.
<EOS>
if
she
could
not
have
be
angry
with
Frank
Churchill
too
,
it
would
have
be
dreadful
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
Jane
Fairfax
,
she
may
at
least
relieve
her
feeling
from
any
present
solicitude
on
her
account
.
<EOS>
Harriet
would
be
anxiety
enough
;
she
need
no
longer
be
unhappy
about
Jane
,
whose
trouble
and
whose
ill
-
health
having
,
of
course
,
the
same
origin
,
must
be
equally
under
cure
.
 
<EOS>
Her
day
of
insignificance
and
evil
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
soon
be
well
,
and
happy
,
and
prosperous
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
could
now
imagine
why
her
own
attention
have
be
slight
.
<EOS>
this
discovery
lay
many
small
matter
open
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
it
have
be
from
jealousy
.
 
<EOS>
in
Jane
's
eye
she
have
be
a
rival
;
and
well
may
any
thing
she
could
offer
of
assistance
or
regard
be
repulse
.
<EOS>
an
airing
in
the
Hartfield
carriage
would
have
be
the
rack
,
and
arrowroot
from
the
Hartfield
storeroom
must
have
be
poison
.
<EOS>
She
understand
it
all
;
and
as
far
as
her
mind
could
disengage
itself
from
the
injustice
and
selfishness
of
angry
feeling
,
she
acknowledge
that
Jane
Fairfax
would
have
neither
elevation
nor
happiness
beyond
her
desert
.
<EOS>
but
poor
Harriet
be
such
an
engrossing
charge
!
<EOS>
there
be
little
sympathy
to
be
spare
for
any
body
else
.
<EOS>
Emma
be
sadly
fearful
that
this
second
disappointment
would
be
more
severe
than
the
first
.
<EOS>
consider
the
very
superior
claim
of
the
object
,
it
ought
;
and
judge
by
its
apparently
strong
effect
on
Harriet
's
mind
,
produce
reserve
and
self
-
command
,
it
would
.
 
<EOS>
She
must
communicate
the
painful
truth
,
however
,
and
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
an
injunction
of
secresy
have
be
among
Mr.
Weston
's
parting
word
.
<EOS>
"
for
the
present
,
the
whole
affair
be
to
be
completely
a
secret
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Churchill
have
make
a
point
of
it
,
as
a
token
of
respect
to
the
wife
he
have
so
very
recently
lose
;
and
every
body
admit
it
to
be
no
more
than
due
decorum
.
"
 
<EOS>
Emma
have
promise
;
but
still
Harriet
must
be
except
.
<EOS>
It
be
her
superior
duty
.
  
<EOS>
in
spite
of
her
vexation
,
she
could
not
help
feel
it
almost
ridiculous
,
that
she
should
have
the
very
same
distressing
and
delicate
office
to
perform
by
Harriet
,
which
Mrs.
Weston
have
just
go
through
by
herself
.
<EOS>
the
intelligence
,
which
have
be
so
anxiously
announce
to
her
,
she
be
now
to
be
anxiously
announce
to
another
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
beat
quick
on
hear
Harriet
's
footstep
and
voice
;
so
,
she
suppose
,
have
poor
Mrs.
Weston
feel
when
_
she
_
be
approach
randall
.
<EOS>
Could
the
event
of
the
disclosure
bear
an
equal
resemblance

<EOS>
but
of
that
,
unfortunately
,
there
could
be
no
chance

<EOS>
"
well

"
cry
Harriet

come
eagerly
into

<EOS>

Emma

unable

whether

any
hint

about

you
need
not

I

just
now

He
tell
me
it
be
to

therefore

I
should
not

all
about

that

that
they

one
another

long

very
odd

<EOS>
It
be
,
indeed
,
so
odd
;
Harriet

behaviour
be
so
extremely
odd

that
Emma
do
not
know
how
to
understand
it

<EOS>
Her
character
appear
absolutely
change

<EOS>
She
seem
to
propose

no
agitation

or
disappointment

concern

Can
you
seriously

You

at

I
can
not

bad
off

I

that
you
should
feel
a
great
difference
between
the
two

as

me

<EOS>
You
must
think
one
five
hundred
million
time
more
above
me

I
hope

Miss

that
supposing

you

your

happen

match
of

great
_
disparity
have
take
place
than
between
Mr.
Frank
Churchill

,
therefore
,
it
seem
as
if
such
a
thing
even
as
this

may
have
occur
before

I
should
be

fortunate

beyond

the
disparity

I
hope
,
<EOS>
dear
Miss
Woodhouse
,
you
will
not
set
yourself
against
it
,
and
try
to
put
difficulty
in
the
way

you
be

I
be

a

make
rapid
progress

<EOS>
She
touch
 
<EOS>
she
admit
 
<EOS>
she
acknowledge
the
whole
truth

<EOS>
why
be
it
so
much
bad
that
Harriet
should
be
in
love
with
Mr.

with
Frank
Churchill

<EOS>
why
be
the
evil
so
dreadfully
increase
by
<EOS>
Harriet

<EOS>
It
dart
through
her
,
with
the
speed
of
an
arrow

that
Mr.

must
marry
no

herself

She
see
it
all
with

have
never

how

how

It

<EOS>
some
portion

respect

however

in

these
demerit
 
some
concern
for

<EOS>
give

the

farther
with
calmness

with

<EOS>
for
her
own
advantage
indeed
,
it
be
fit
that
the

extent
of
Harriet

enquire
into
;

Harriet
have
do
nothing

the

rouse
from
reflection

therefore
,
and
subdue
her
emotion
,
she
turn
to
Harriet
again
,
and
,
in
a
more
inviting
accent
,
renew
the
conversation
;
for
as
to
the
subject
which
have
first
introduce
it
,
the
wonderful
story
of
Jane
Fairfax
,
that
be
quite
sink
and
lose
.
 
<EOS>
neither
of

of
Mr.

themselves

Harriet
,
who
have
be
stand
in
no
unhappy
reverie
,
be
yet
very
glad
to
be
call
from
it
,
by
the
now
encourage
manner
of
such
a
judge
,
and
such
a
friend
as
Miss
Woodhouse
,
and
<EOS>
only
want
invitation
,
to
give
the
history
of
her
hope
with
great
,
though
tremble
delight
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
's
trembling
as
she
ask
,
and
as
she
listen
,
be
better
conceal
than
Harriet
's
,
but
they
be
not
less
.
<EOS>
Her
voice
be
not
unsteady
;
but
her
mind
be
in
all
the
perturbation
that
such
a
development
of
self
,
such
a
burst
of
threaten
evil
,
such
a
confusion
of
sudden
and
perplexing
emotion
,
must
create
.
 
<EOS>
She
listen
with
much
inward
suffering
,
but
with
great
outward
patience
,
to
Harriet
's
detail
.
 
<EOS>
Methodical
,
or
well
arrange
,
or
very
well
deliver
,
it
could
not
be
expect
to
be
;
but
it
contain
,
when
separate
from
all
the
feebleness
and
tautology
of
the
narration
,
a
substance
to
sink
her
spirit
 
especially
with
the
corroborate
circumstance
,
which
her
own
memory
bring
in
favour
of
Mr.
Knightley
's
most
improved
opinion
of
Harriet
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
have
be
conscious
of
a
difference
in
his
behaviour
ever
since
those
two
decisive
dance
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
know
that
he
have
,
on
that
occasion
,
find
her
much
superior
to
his
expectation
.
<EOS>
from
that
evening
,
or
at
least
from
the
time
of
Miss
Woodhouse
's
encourage
her
to
think
of
him
,
Harriet
have
begin
to
be
sensible
of
his
talking
to
her
much
more
than
he
have
be
use
to
do
,
and
of
his
have
indeed
quite
a
different
manner
towards
her
;
a
manner
of
kindness
and
sweetness
!
 
<EOS>
latterly
she
have
be
more
and
more
aware
of
it
.
<EOS>
when
they
have
be
all
walk
together
,
he
have
so
often
come
and
walk
by
her
,
and
talk
so
very
delightfully
!
 
<EOS>
He
seem
to
want
to
be
acquaint
with
her
.
<EOS>
Emma
know
it
to
have
be
very
much
the
case
.
<EOS>
She
have
often
observe
the
change
,
to
almost
the
same
extent
.
 
<EOS>
Harriet
repeat
expression
of
approbation
and
praise
from
him
 
and
Emma
feel
them
to
be
in
the
close
agreement
with
what
she
have
know
of
his
opinion
of
Harriet
.
<EOS>
He
praise
her
for
be
without
art
or
affectation
,
for
have
simple
,
honest
,
generous
,
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
She
know
that
he
see
such
recommendation
in
Harriet
;
he
have
dwell
on
them
to
her
more
than
once
.
 
<EOS>
much
that
live
in
Harriet
's
memory
,
many
little
particular
of
the
notice
she
have
receive
from
him
,
a
look
,
a
speech
,
a
removal
from
one
chair
to
another
,
a
compliment
imply
,
a
preference
infer
,
have
be
unnoticed
,
because
unsuspected
,
by
Emma
.
<EOS>
circumstance
that
may
swell
to
half
an
hour
's
relation
,
and
contain
multiplied
proof
to
her
who
have
see
them
,
have
pass
undiscerned
by
her
who
now
hear
them
;
but
the
two
late
occurrence
to
be
mention
,
the
two
of
strong
promise
to
Harriet
,
be
not
without
some
degree
of
witness
from
Emma
herself
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
,
be
his
walk
with
her
apart
from
the
other
,
in
the
lime
-
walk
at
Donwell
,
where
they
have
be
walk
some
time
before
Emma
come
,
and
he
have
take
pain
(
as
she
be
convince
)
to
draw
her
from
the
rest
to
himself
 
and
at
first
,
he
have
talk
to
her
in
a
more
particular
way
than
he
have
ever
do
before
,
in
a
very
particular
way
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
(
Harriet
could
not
recall
it
without
a
blush
.
)
<EOS>
He
seem
to
be
almost
ask
her
,
whether
her
affection
be
engage
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
soon
as
she
(
Miss
Woodhouse
)
appear
likely
to
join
them
,
he
change
the
subject
,
and
begin
talk
about
farming
:
 
the
second
,
be
his
have
sit
talk
with
her
nearly
half
an
hour
before
Emma
come
back
from
her
visit
,
the
very
last
morning
of
his
being
at
Hartfield
 
though
,
when
he
first
come
in
,
he
have
say
that
he
could
not
stay
five
minute
 
and
his
have
tell
her
,
during
their
conversation
,
that
though
he
must
go
to
London
,
it
be
very
much
against
his
inclination
that
he
leave
home
at
all
,
which
be
much
more
(
as
Emma
feel
)
than
he
have
acknowledge
to
_
her
_
.
<EOS>
the
superior
degree
of
confidence
towards
Harriet
,
which
this
one
article
mark
,
give
her
severe
pain
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
subject
of
the
first
of
the
two
circumstance
,
she
do
,
after
a
little
reflection
,
venture
the
follow
question
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
may
he
not
?
 
be
not
it
possible
,
that
when
enquire
,
as
you
think
,
into
the
state
of
your
affection
,
he
may
be
allude
to
Mr.
Martin
 
<EOS>
he
may
have
Mr.
Martin
's
interest
in
view
?
<EOS>
but
Harriet
reject
the
suspicion
with
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Martin
!
<EOS>
no
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
hint
of
Mr.
Martin
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
know
better
now
,
than
to
care
for
Mr.
Martin
,
or
to
be
suspect
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
Harriet
have
close
her
evidence
,
she
appeal
to
her
dear
Miss
Woodhouse
,
to
say
whether
she
have
not
good
ground
for
hope
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
should
have
presume
to
think
of
it
at
first
,
"
say
she
,
"
but
for
you
.
<EOS>
You
tell
me
to
observe
him
carefully
,
and
let
his
behaviour
be
the
rule
of
mine
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
have
.
<EOS>
but
now
I
seem
to
feel
that
I
may
deserve
him
;
and
that
if
he
do
chuse
me
,
it
will
not
be
any
thing
so
very
wonderful
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
bitter
feeling
occasion
by
this
speech
,
the
many
bitter
feeling
,
make
the
utmost
exertion
necessary
on
Emma
's
side
,
to
enable
her
to
say
on
reply
,
  
"
Harriet
,
I
will
only
venture
to
declare
,
that
Mr.
Knightley
be
the
last
man
in
the
world
,
who
would
intentionally
give
any
woman
the
idea
of
his
feeling
for
her
more
than
he
really
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
seem
ready
to
worship
her
friend
for
a
sentence
so
satisfactory
;
and
Emma
be
only
save
from
rapture
and
fondness
,
which
at
that
moment
would
have
be
dreadful
penance
,
by
the
sound
of
her
father
's
footstep
.
<EOS>
He
be
come
through
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Harriet
be
too
much
agitate
to
encounter
him
.
<EOS>
"
She
could
not
compose
herself
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
would
be
alarm
 
<EOS>
she
have
better
go
;
"
 
with
most
ready
encouragement
from
her
friend
,
therefore
,
she
pass
off
through
another
door
 
and
<EOS>
the
moment
she
be
go
<EOS>
,
this
be
the
spontaneous
burst
of
Emma
's
feeling
:
"
<EOS>
oh
God
!
<EOS>
that
I
have
never
see
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
rest
of
the
day
,
the
following
night
,
be
hardly
enough
for
her
thought
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
bewilder
amidst
the
confusion
of
all
that
have
rush
on
her
within
the
last
few
hour
.
<EOS>
every
moment
have
bring
a
fresh
surprize
;
and
every
surprize
must
be
matter
of
humiliation
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
how
to
understand
it
all
!
<EOS>
how
to
understand
the
deception
she
have
be
thus
practise
on
herself
,
and
live
under
!
 
<EOS>
the
blunder
,
the
blindness
of
her
own
head
and
heart
!
 
<EOS>
she
sit
still
<EOS>
,
she
walk
about
,
she
try
her
own
room
,
she
try
the
shrubbery
 
in
every
place
,
every
posture
,
she
perceive
that
she
have
act
most
weakly
;
that
she
have
be
impose
on
by
other
in
a
most
mortifying
degree
;
that
she
have
be
impose
on
herself
in
a
degree
yet
more
mortifying
;
that
she
be
wretched
,
and
should
probably
find
this
day
but
the
beginning
of
wretchedness
.
  
<EOS>
to
understand
,
thoroughly
understand
her
own
heart
,
be
the
first
endeavour
.
<EOS>
to
that
point
go
every
leisure
moment
which
her
father
's
claim
on
her
allow
,
and
every
moment
of
involuntary
absence
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
how
long
have
Mr.
Knightley
be
so
dear
to
her
,
as
every
feeling
declare
him
now
to
be
?
<EOS>
when
have
his
influence
,
such
influence
begin
?
  
<EOS>
when
have
he
succeed
to
that
place
in
her
affection
,
which
Frank
Churchill
have
once
,
for
a
short
period
,
occupy
?
 
<EOS>
She
look
back
;
she
compare
the
two
 
compare
them
,
as
they
have
always
stand
in
her
estimation
,
from
the
time
of
the
latter
's
become
know
to
her
 
<EOS>
and
as
they
must
at
any
time
have
be
compare
by
her
,
have
it
 
<EOS>
oh
!
have
it
,
by
any
blessed
felicity
,
occur
to
her
,
to
institute
the
comparison
.
 
<EOS>
She
see
that
there
never
have
be
a
time
when
she
do
not
consider
Mr.
Knightley
as
infinitely
the
superior
,
or
when
his
regard
for
her
have
not
be
infinitely
the
most
dear
.
<EOS>
She
see
,
that
in
persuade
herself
,
in
fancy
,
in
act
to
the
contrary
,
she
have
be
entirely
under
a
delusion
,
totally
ignorant
of
her
own
heart
 
and
,
in
short
,
that
she
have
never
really
care
for
Frank
Churchill
at
all
!
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
conclusion
of
the
first
series
of
reflection
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
knowledge
of
herself
,
on
the
first
question
of
inquiry
,
which
she
reach
;
and
without
be
long
in
reach
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
most
sorrowfully
indignant
;
ashamed
of
every
sensation
but
<EOS>
the
one
reveal
to
her
 
her
affection
for
Mr.
Knightley
.
 
<EOS>
every
other
part
of
her
mind
be
disgusting
.
  
<EOS>
with
insufferable
vanity
have
she
believe
herself
in
the
secret
of
every
body
's
feeling
;
with
unpardonable
arrogance

Mr.

<EOS>
It

Mr.

<EOS>
such

<EOS>
such
a
debasement
on

<EOS>
It
be
horrible
to
Emma
to

how
it

sink
him
in
the
general
opinion
,
to
foresee
the
smile
,
the
sneer
,
the
merriment
it
would
prompt
at
his

;
the
mortification

disdain
of
his

the
thousand
inconvenience
to
himself

<EOS>
Could
it
be
?
 
<EOS>
no
;
it
be
impossible

<EOS>
and
yet
it

very

<EOS>
be
it
a

for
a
man
of

ability
to

by
very
inferior

<EOS>
be
it
new
for
one
,
perhaps
too
busy
to
seek
,
to
be
the
prize
of
a

who
would
seek
him
?
 
<EOS>
be
it
new
for
any

to

incongruous

for

<EOS>
oh

have
she

Harriet
forward

have

none

how

but
Harriet

Her

She

<EOS>
She
have
not

she

negligent

perverse
,
slight
his

or
even
wilfully
oppose
him

insensible
of
half
his

quarrel
with

because

<EOS>
in

very

when

which

she
could

<EOS>
Harriet

may

not

exclusively

passionately

<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She

<EOS>
She

herself
with
any
idea

<EOS>
She
have
receive
a
very
recent
proof
of
its
impartiality
.
 
<EOS>
how
shocked
have
he
be
by
her
behaviour
to
Miss
Bates
!
<EOS>
how
directly
,
how
strongly
have
he
express
himself
to
her
on
the
subject
!
 
<EOS>
not
too
strongly
for
the
offence
 
but
far
,
far
too
strongly
to
issue
from
any
feeling
soft
than
upright
justice
and
clear

sight
goodwill
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
no
hope
,
nothing
to
deserve
the
name
of
hope
,
that
he
could
have
that
sort
of
affection
for
herself
which
be
now
in
question
;
but
there
be
a
hope
(
at
time
a
slight
one
,
at
time
much
strong
,
)
<EOS>
that
Harriet
may
have
deceive
herself
,
and
be
overrate
his
regard
for
_

<EOS>
wish
it
<EOS>
she
must
,
for
his
sake
 
be
the

nothing
to

but
his
remain
single
all
his
life

<EOS>
Could
she
be
secure
of
that
,
indeed
,
of
his
never
marry
at

<EOS>
,
she
believe
she
should
be
perfectly
satisfied

<EOS>
let
him
but
continue
the
same
Mr.
Knightley
to
her
and
her
father
,
the
same
Mr.
Knightley
to
all
the
world
;
let
Donwell
and
Hartfield
lose
none
of
their
precious
intercourse
of
friendship
and
confidence
,
and
her
peace
would
be
fully
secure
.
 
<EOS>
marriage
,
in
fact
,
would
not
do
for
her
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
incompatible
with
what
she
owe
to
her
father
,
and
with
what
she
feel
for
him
.
<EOS>
nothing
should
separate
her
from
her
father
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
marry
,
even
if
she
be
ask
by
Mr.
Knightley
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
her
ardent
wish
that
Harriet
may
be
disappointed
;
and
she
hope
,
that
when
able
to
see
them
together
again
,
she
may
at
least
be
able
to
ascertain
what
the
chance
for
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
She
should
see
them
henceforward
with
the
close
observance
;
and
wretchedly
as
she
have
hitherto
misunderstood
even
those
she
be
watch
,
she
do
not
know
how
to
admit
that
she
could
be
blind
here
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
expect
back
every
day
.
<EOS>
the
power
of
observation
would
be
soon
give
 
frightfully
soon
it
appear
when
her
thought
be
in
one
course
.
<EOS>
in
the
meanwhile
,
she
resolve
against
see
Harriet
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
do
neither
of
them
good
<EOS>
,
it
would
do
the
subject
<EOS>
no
good
,
to
be
talk
of
it
farther
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
resolve
not

be
convince
,
as
long
as
she
could
doubt
,
and
yet
have
no
authority
for
oppose
Harriet

confidence
.
<EOS>
to
talk
would
be
only
to
irritate
.
 
<EOS>
She
write
to
her
,
therefore
,
kindly
,
but
decisively
,
to
beg
that
she
would
not
,
at
present
,
come
to
Hartfield
;
acknowledge
it
to
be
her
conviction
,
that
all
farther
confidential
discussion
of
_
one
<EOS>
_
topic
have
better
be
avoid
;
and
hope
,
that
if
a
few
day
be
allow
to
pass
before
they
meet
again
,
except
in
the
company
of
other
 
<EOS>
she

only
to
a
tete

a

they

Harriet

this
point

Emma

a

the

Mrs.

who
have
be
call
on
her
daughter
-
in
-
law
elect
,
and
take
Hartfield
in
her
way
home
,
almost
as
much
in
duty
to
Emma
as
in
pleasure
to
herself
,
to
relate
all
the
particular
of
so
interesting
an
interview
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
have
accompany
her
to
Mrs.
Bates
's
,
and
go
through
his
share
of
this
essential
attention
most
handsomely
;
but
she
have
then
induce
Miss
Fairfax
to
join
her
in
an
airing
,
be
now
return
with
much
more
to
say
,
and
much
more
to
say
with
satisfaction
,
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
spend
in
Mrs.
Bates
's
parlour
,
with
all
the
encumbrance
of
awkward
feeling
,
could
have
afford
.
  
<EOS>
a
little
curiosity
Emma
have
;
and
she
make
the
most
of
it
while
her
friend
relate
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
have
set
off
to
pay
the
visit
in
a
good
deal
of
agitation
herself
;
and
in
the
first
place
have
wish
not
to
go
at
all
at
present
,
to
be
allow
merely
to
write
to
Miss
Fairfax
instead
,
and
to
defer
this
ceremonious
call
till
a
little
time
have
pass
,
and
Mr.
Churchill
could
be
reconcile
to
the
engagement
's
become
know
;
as
,
consider
every
thing
,
she
think
such
a
visit
could
not
be
pay
without
lead
to
report
:
 
but
Mr.
Weston
have
think
differently
;
he
be
extremely
anxious
to
shew
his
approbation
to
Miss
Fairfax
and
her
family
,
and
do
not
conceive
that
any
suspicion
could
be
excite
by
it
;
or
if
it
be
,
that
it
would
be
of
any
consequence
;
for
"
such
thing
,
"
he
observe
,
"
always
get
about
.
"
<EOS>
Emma
smile
,
and
feel
that
Mr.
Weston
have
very
good
reason
for
say
so
.
<EOS>
They
have
go
,
in
short
 
and
very
great
<EOS>
have
be
the
evident
distress
and
confusion
of
the
lady
.
<EOS>
She
have
hardly
be
able
to
speak
a
word
,
and
every
look
and
action
have
shew
how
deeply
she
be
suffer
from
consciousness
.
<EOS>
the
quiet
,
heart
-
feel
satisfaction
of
the
old
lady
,
and
the
rapturous
delight
of
her
daughter
 
who
prove
even
too
joyous
to
talk
as
usual
,
have
be
a
gratifying
,
yet
almost
an
affect
,
scene
.
<EOS>
They
be
both
so
truly
respectable
in
their
happiness
,
so
disintereste
in
every
sensation
;
think
so
much
of
Jane
;
so
much
of
every
body
,
and
so
little
of
themselves
,
that
every
kindly
feeling
be
at
work
for
them
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairfax
's
recent
illness
have
offer
a
fair
plea
for
Mrs.
Weston
to
invite
her
to
an
airing
;
she
have
draw
back
and
decline
at
first
,
but
,
on
be
press
have
yield
;
and
,
in
the
course
of
their
drive
,
Mrs.
Weston
have
,
by
gentle
encouragement
,
overcome
so
much
of
her
embarrassment
,
as
to
bring
her
to
converse
on
the
important
subject
.
<EOS>
apology
for
her
seemingly
ungracious
silence
in
their
first
reception
,
and
the
warm
expression
of
the
gratitude
she
be
always
feel
towards
herself
and
Mr.
Weston
,
must
necessarily
open
the
cause
;
but
when
these
effusion
be
put
by
,
they
have
talk
a
good
deal
of
the
present
and
of
the
future
state
of
the
engagement
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
be
convince
that
such
conversation
must
be
the
great
relief
to
her
companion
,
pen
up
within
her
own
mind
as
every
thing
have
so
long
be
,
and
be
very
much
pleased
with
all
that
she
have
say
on
the
subject
.

"
on
the
misery
of
what
she
have
suffer

during
the
concealment
of
so
many
month

Mrs.
Weston
,

she
be
energetic

<EOS>
this
be
one
of
her
expression
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
say
,
that
since
I
enter
into
the
engagement
I

not

some
happy
moment

I
can
say
,
that
I
have
never

the
blessing

the
quivering

Emma

wrong

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
the
consequence

say
she

have
be
a

perpetual

after
all

that
misconduct
can
bring

still

the
fortunate
turn
that
every

her
captious

She
then
begin

It

<EOS>
such

she

She

she

<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
's
communication
furnish
Emma
with
more
food
for
unpleasant
reflection
,
by
increase
her
esteem
and
compassion
,
and
her
sense
of
past
injustice
towards
Miss
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
She
bitterly
regret
not
have
seek
a
close
acquaintance
with
her
,
and
blush
for
the
envious
feeling
which
have
certainly
be
,
in
some
measure
,
the
cause
.
<EOS>
have
she
follow
Mr.
Knightley
's
know
wish
,
in
pay
that
attention
to
Miss
Fairfax
,
which
be
every
way
her
due
;
<EOS>
have
she
try
to
know
her
better
;
have
she
do
her
part
towards
intimacy
;
have
she
endeavour
to
find
a
friend
there
instead
of
in
Harriet
Smith
;
she
must
,
in
all
probability
,
have
be
spare
from
every
pain
which
press
on
her
now
.
 
<EOS>
Birth
,
ability
,
and
education

have
be
equally
mark
one
as
an
associate
for
her
,
to
be
receive
with
gratitude
;
and
the
other
 
<EOS>
what
be
she
?
 
<EOS>
suppose
<EOS>
even
that
they
have
never
become
intimate
friend
;
that
she
have
never
be
admit
into
Miss
Fairfax
's
confidence
on
this
important
matter
 
which
be
most
probable
 
still
,
in
know
her
as
she
ought
,
and
as
she
may
,
she
must
have
be
preserve
from
the
abominable
suspicion
of
an
improper
attachment
to
Mr.
Dixon
,
which
she
have
not
only
so
foolishly
fashioned
and
harbour
herself
,
but
have
so
unpardonably
impart
;
an
idea
which
she
greatly
fear
have
be
make
a
subject
of
material
distress
to
the
delicacy
of
Jane
's
feeling
,
by
the
levity
or
carelessness
of
Frank
Churchill
's
.
<EOS>
of
all
the
source
of
evil
surround
the
former
,
since
her
come
to
Highbury
,
she
be
persuade
that
she
must
herself
have
be
the
bad
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
be
a
perpetual
enemy
.
<EOS>
They
never
could
have
be
all
three
together
,
without
her
have
stab
Jane
Fairfax
's
peace
in
a
thousand
instance
;
and
on
Box
Hill
,
perhaps
,
it
have
be
the
agony
of
a
mind
that
would
bear
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
the
evening
of
this
day
be
very
long
,
and
melancholy
,
at
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
the
weather
add
what
it
could
of
gloom
.
<EOS>
a
cold
stormy
rain
set
in
,
and
nothing
of
July
appear
but
in
the
tree
and
shrub
,
which
the
wind
be
despoil
,
and
the
length
of
the
day
,
which
only
make
such
cruel
sight
the
longer
visible
.
  
<EOS>
the
weather
affect
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
and
he
could
only
be
keep
tolerably
comfortable
by
almost
ceaseless
attention
on
his
daughter
's
side
,
and
by
exertion
which
have
never
cost
her
half
so
much
before
.
<EOS>
It
remind
her
of
their
first
forlorn
tete
-
a
-
tete
,
on
the
evening
of
Mrs.
Weston
's
wedding
-
day
;
but
Mr.
Knightley
have
walk
in
then
,
soon
after
tea
,
and
dissipate
every
melancholy
fancy
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
such
delightful
proof
of
Hartfield
's
attraction
,
as
those
sort
of
visit
convey
,
may
shortly
be
over
.
<EOS>
the
picture
which
she
have
then
draw
of
the
privation
of
the
approach
winter
,
have
prove
erroneous
;
no
friend
have
desert
them
,
no
pleasure
have
be
lose
.
 
<EOS>
but
her
present
foreboding
she
fear
would
experience
no
similar
contradiction
.
<EOS>
the
prospect
before
her
now
,
be
threaten
to
a
degree
that
could
not
be
entirely
dispel
 
that
may
not
be
even
partially
brightened
.
<EOS>
if
all
take
place
that
may
take
place
among
the
circle
of
her
friend
,
Hartfield
must
be
comparatively
desert
;
and
she
leave
to
cheer
her
father
with
the
spirit
only
of
ruin
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
the
child
to
be
bear
at
randall
must
be
a
tie
there
even
dearer
than
herself
;
and
Mrs.
Weston
's
heart
and
time
would
be
occupy
by
it
.
<EOS>
They
should
lose
her
;
and
,
probably
,
in
great
measure
,
her
husband
also
.
 
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
would
return
among
them
no
more
;
and
Miss
Fairfax
,
it
be
reasonable
to
suppose
,
would
soon
cease
to
belong
to
Highbury
.
<EOS>
They
would
be
married
,
and
settle
either
at
or
near
Enscombe
.
<EOS>
all
that
be
good
would
be
withdraw
;
and
if
to
these
loss
,
the
loss
of
Donwell
be
to
be
add
,
what
would
remain
of
cheerful
or
of
rational
society
within
their
reach
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
to
be
no
longer
come
there
for
his
evening
comfort
!
 
<EOS>
no
longer
walk
in
at
all
hour
,
as
if
ever
willing
to
change
his
own
home
for
their
'
!
 
<EOS>
how
be
it
to
be
endure
?
<EOS>
and
if
he
be
to
be
lose
to
them
for
Harriet
's
sake
;
if
he
be
to
be
think
of
hereafter
,
as
find
in
Harriet
's
society
all
that
he
want
;
if
Harriet
be
to
be
the
choose
,
the
first
,
the
dear
,
the
friend
,
the
wife
to
whom
he
look
for
all
the
good
blessing
of
existence
;
what
could
be
increase
Emma
's
wretchedness
but
the
reflection
never
far
distant
from
her
mind
,
that
it
have
be
all
her
own
work
?
  
<EOS>
when
it
come
to
such
a
pitch
as
this
,
she
be
not
able
to
refrain
from
a
start
,
or
a
heavy
sigh
,
or
even
from
walk
about
the
room
for
a
few
second
 
and
<EOS>
the
only
source
whence
any
thing
like
consolation
or
composure
could
be
draw
,
be
in
the
resolution
of
her
own
well
conduct
,
and
<EOS>
the
hope
that
,
however
inferior
in
spirit
and
gaiety
may
be
the
follow
and
every
future
winter
of
her
life
to
the
past
<EOS>
,
it
would
yet
find
her
more
rational
,
more
acquainted
with
herself
,
and
leave
her
less
to
regret
when
it
be
go
.
    
<EOS>
the
weather
continue
much
the
same
all
the
following
morning
;
and
the
same
loneliness
,
and
the
same
melancholy
,
seem
to
reign
at
Hartfield
 
but
in
the
afternoon
it
clear
;
the
wind
change
into
a
soft
quarter
;
the
cloud
be
carry
off
;
the
sun
appear
;
it
be
summer
again
.
<EOS>
with
all
the
eagerness
which
such
a
transition
give
,
Emma
resolve
to
be
out
of
door
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
never
have
the
exquisite
sight
,
smell
,
sensation
of
nature
,
tranquil
,
warm
,
and
brilliant
after
a
storm
,
be
more
attractive
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
long
for
the
serenity
they
may
gradually
introduce
;
and
on
Mr.
Perry
's
come
in
soon
after
dinner
,
with
a
disengaged
hour
to
give
her
father
,
she
lose
no
time
in
hurrying
into
the
shrubbery
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
with
spirit
freshen
,
and
thought
a
little
relieved
,
she
have
take
a
few
turn
,
when
she
see
Mr.
Knightley
pass
through
the
garden
door
,
and
come
towards
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
intimation
of
his
be
return
from
London
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
think
of
him
the
moment
before
,
as
unquestionably
sixteen
mile
distant
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
time
only
for
the
quick
arrangement
of
mind
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
collect
and
calm
.
<EOS>
in
half
a
minute
they
be
together
.
<EOS>
the
"
how
d'ye
do
's
"
be
quiet
and
constrain
on
each
side
.
<EOS>
She
ask
after
their
mutual
friend
;
they
be
all
well
.
 
<EOS>
when
have
he
leave
them
?
 
<EOS>
only
that
morning
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
have
a
wet
ride
.
 
<EOS>
yes
.
 
<EOS>
He
mean
to
walk
with
her
,
she
find
.
<EOS>
"
He
have
just
look
into
the
dining
-
room
,
and
as
he
be
not
want
there
,
prefer
be
out
of
door
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
think
he
neither
look
nor
speak
cheerfully
;
and
the
first
possible
cause
for
it
,
suggest
by
her
fear
,
be
,
that
he
have
perhaps
be
communicate
his
plan
to
his
brother
,
and
be
pain
by
the
manner
in
which
they
have
be
receive
.
  
<EOS>
They
walk
together
.
<EOS>
He
be
silent
.
<EOS>
She
think
he
be
often
look
at
her
,
and
try
for
a
full
view
of
her
face
than
it
suit
her
to
give
.
<EOS>
and
this
belief
produce
another
dread
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
want
to
speak
to
her
,
of
his
attachment
to
Harriet
;
he
may
be
watch
for
encouragement
to
begin
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
,
could
not
,
feel
equal
to
lead
the
way
to
any
such
subject
.
<EOS>
He
must
do
it
all
himself
.
<EOS>
yet
she
could
not
bear
this
silence
.
<EOS>
with
him
it
be
most
unnatural
.
<EOS>
She
consider
 
resolve
 
and
,
try
to
smile
,
begin
    
"
You

some

I

he
quietly

"
<EOS>

after

a

cry
Emma

turn
her
glowing
cheek
towards
him

for
,
while
she
speak
,
it
occur
to
her
that
he
may
have
call
at
Mrs.

in
his

set
you

me
to
act
by

in
a
way
that
I
must
always
be
ashamed

I
be
very
foolishly

to
say

do
many
thing

me
open

unpleasant
conjecture

assure
myself
as

the
degree
of
what
you
feel
 
<EOS>
I
could
only
be
certain
that
there
be
a
preference

a
preference

I
never

,
perhaps
,
since

an
impression

I
have
as
much
reason

that
I

He
listen

She
wish
him
to

he
would
not

<EOS>
She
suppose
she
must
say
more
before
she
be
entitle
to
his
clemency

it
be
a
hard
case

be
oblige
still
to

go
on

by

allow
myself
to
appear

an

probably
 
a
common

no

than
have
happen

it

indeed
 
I
have
have
no

I
think
them
a
habit

a
trick

nothing
that
call
for
seriousness

comprehend
his

It
be
merely
a
blind
to
conceal
his
real
situation

another

<EOS>
It
be
his
object
to
blind
all
about
him

no
one

I
be
sure
,
could
be
more
effectually
blind
than
myself

silent

seem
to

within
half

in
an
accent

deep
mortification

would
listen

She
may
assist
his
resolution

reconcile
him
to
it

she
may
give
just
praise
to

,
by
represent
to
him
his
own
independence

relieve
him
from
that
state

indecision

must
be
more
intolerable

mind
be
most
busy

,
with
all
the
wonderful
velocity
of
thought
,
have
be
able
 
and
yet
without
lose
a
word
 
to
catch
and
comprehend
the
exact
truth
of
the
whole
;
to
see
that
Harriet
's
hope
have
be
entirely
groundless
,
a
mistake
,
a
delusion

as
complete
a
delusion
as
any
of
her
own
 
that
Harriet
be
nothing
;
that
she
be
every
thing
herself
;
that
what
she
have
be
say
relative
to
Harriet
have
be
all
take
as
the
language
of
her
own
feeling
;
and
that
her
agitation
,
her
doubt
,
her
reluctance
,
her
discouragement
,
have
be
all
receive
as
discouragement
from
herself

<EOS>
and
not
only
be
there
time
for
these
conviction
,
with
all
their
glow
of
attendant
happiness
;
there
be
time
also
to
rejoice
that
Harriet

secret
have
not
escape
her
,
and
to
resolve
that
it
need
not

and
should
not

<EOS>
It
be
all
the
service
she
could
now
render
her
poor
friend

for
as
to
any
of
that
heroism
of
sentiment
which
may
have
prompt
her
to
entreat
him
to
transfer
his
affection
from
herself
to
Harriet
,
as
infinitely
the
most
worthy
of
the
two
 
or
even
the
more
simple
sublimity
of
resolve
to
refuse
him
at
once
and
for
ever
,
without
vouchsafe
any
motive
,
because
he
could
not
marry
them
both
,
Emma
have
it
not
.
<EOS>
She
feel
for
Harriet
,
with
pain
and
with
contrition
;
but
no
flight
of
generosity
run
mad
,
oppose
all
that
could
be
probable

reasonable
,
enter
her
brain
.
<EOS>
She
have
lead
her
friend
astray
,
and
it
would
be
a
reproach
to
her
for
ever
;

her
judgment
be
as
strong

her
feeling

as
strong
as
it
have
ever
be
before

in
reprobate
any
such
alliance
for
him
,
as
most
unequal
and
degrading
.
<EOS>
Her
way
be
clear
,
though
not
quite
smooth
.
 
<EOS>
She
speak
then
,
on
be
so
entreat
.
 
<EOS>
what
do
she
say
?
 
<EOS>
just
what
she
ought
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
a
lady
always
do
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
enough
to
shew
there
nee
not
be
despair
 
and
to
invite
him
to
say
more
himself
.
<EOS>
He
_
have
_
despair
at
one
period
;
he
have
receive
such
an
injunction
to
caution
and
silence
,
as
for
the
time
crush
every
hope
;
 
she
have
begin
by
refuse
to
hear
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
change
have
perhaps
be
somewhat
sudden
;
 
her
proposal
of
take
another
turn
,
her
renew
the
conversation
which
she
have
just
put
an
end
to
,
may
be
a
little
extraordinary
!
 
<EOS>
She
feel
its
inconsistency
;
but
Mr.
Knightley
be
so
obliging
as
to
put
up
with
it
,
and
seek
no
farther
explanation
.
  
<EOS>
seldom
,
very
seldom
,
do
complete
truth
belong
to
any
human
disclosure
;
seldom
can
it
happen
that
something
be
not
a
little
disguised
,
or
a
little
mistaken
;
but
where
,
as
in
this
case
,
though
the
conduct
be
mistake
,
the
feeling
be
not
,
it
may
not
be
very
material
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
could
not
impute
to
Emma
a
more
relent
heart
than
she
possess
,
or
a
heart
more
disposed
to
accept
of
his
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
,
in
fact
,
be
wholly
unsuspicious
of
his
own
influence
.
<EOS>
He
have
follow
her
into
the
shrubbery
with
no
idea
of
try
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
come
,
in
his
anxiety
to
see
how
she
bear
Frank
Churchill
's
engagement
,
with
no
selfish
view
,
no
view
at
all
,
but
of
endeavour
,
if
she
allow
him
an
opening
,
to
soothe
or
to
counsel
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
rest
have
be
the
work
of
the
moment
,
the
immediate
effect
of
what
he
hear
,
on
his
feeling
.
<EOS>
the
delightful
assurance
of
her
total
indifference
towards
Frank
Churchill
,
of
her
have
a
heart
completely
disengage
from
him
,
have
give
birth
to
the
hope
,
that
,
in
time
,
he
may
gain
her
affection
himself
;
 
but
it
have
be
no
present
hope
 
<EOS>
he
have
only
,
in
the
momentary
conquest
of
eagerness
over
judgment
,
aspire
to
be
tell
that
she
do
not
forbid
his
attempt
to
attach
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
superior
hope
which
gradually
open
be
so
much
the
more
enchanting
.
 
<EOS>
the
affection
,
which
he
have
be
ask
to
be
allow
to
create
,
if
he
could
,
be
already
his
!
 
<EOS>
within
half
an
hour
,
he
have
pass
from
a
thoroughly
distressed
state
of
mind
,
to
something
so
like
perfect
happiness
,
that
it
could
bear
no
other
name
.
  
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Her
_
change
be
equal
.
 
<EOS>
this
one
half
-
hour
have
give
to
each
the
same
precious
certainty
of
be
beloved
,
have
clear
from
each
the
same
degree
of
ignorance
,
jealousy
,
or
distrust
.
 
<EOS>
on
his
side
,
there
have
be
a
long
-
stand
jealousy
,
old
as
the
arrival
,
or
even
the
expectation
,
of
Frank
Churchill
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
in
love
with
Emma
,
and
jealous
of
Frank
Churchill
,
from
about
the
same
period
,
one
sentiment
have
probably
enlighten
him
as
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
jealousy
of
Frank
Churchill
that
have
take
him
from
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
the
Box
Hill
party
have
decide
him
on
go
away
.
<EOS>
He
would
save
himself
from
witness
again
such
permit
,
encouraged
attention
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
go
to
learn
to
be
indifferent
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
go
to
a
wrong
place
.
<EOS>
there
be
too
much
domestic
happiness
in
his
brother
's
house
;
woman
wear
too
amiable
a
form
in
it
;
Isabella
be
too
much
like
Emma
 
differ
only
in
those
striking
inferiority
,
which
always
bring
the
other
in
brilliancy
before
him
,
for
much
to
have
be
do
,
even
have
his
time
be
long
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
stay
on
,
however
,
vigorously
,
day
after
day
 
till
this
very
morning
's
post
have
convey
the
history
of
Jane
Fairfax
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
with
the
gladness
which
must
be
feel
,
nay
,
which
he
do
not
scruple
to
feel
,
have
never
believe
Frank
Churchill
to
be
at
all
deserve
Emma
,
be
there
so
much
fond
solicitude
,
so
much
keen
anxiety
for
her
,
that
he
could
stay
no
longer
.
<EOS>
He
have
ride
home
through
the
rain
;
and
have
walk
up
directly
after
dinner
,
to
see
how
this
sweetest
and
good
of
all
creature
,
faultless
in
spite
of
all
her
fault
,
bear
the
discovery
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
find
her
agitated
and
low
.
 
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
be
a
villain
.
  
<EOS>
He
hear
her
declare
that
she
have
never
love
him
.
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
's
character
be
not
desperate
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
his
own
Emma
,
by
hand
and
word
,
when
they
return
into
the
house
;
and
if
he
could
have
think
of
Frank
Churchill
then
,
he
may
have
deem
him
a
very
good
sort
of
fellow
.
    
<EOS>
what
totally
different
feeling
do
Emma
take
back
into
the
house
from
what
she
have
bring
out
!
 
<EOS>
she
have
then
be
only
dare
to
hope
for
a
little
respite
of
suffering
;
 
she
be
now
in
an
exquisite
flutter
of
happiness
,
and
such
happiness
moreover
as
she
believe
must
still
be
great
when
the
flutter
should
have
pass
away
.
  
<EOS>
They
sit
down
to
tea
 
<EOS>
the
same
party
round
the
same
table
 
<EOS>
how
often
it
have
be
collect
!
 
<EOS>
and
how
often
have
her
eye
fall
on
the
same
shrub
in
the
lawn
,
and
observe
the
same
beautiful
effect
of
the
western
sun
!
 
<EOS>
but
never
in
such
a
state
of
spirit
,
never
in
any
thing
like
it
;
and
it
be
with
difficulty
that
she
could
summon
enough
of
her
usual
self
to
be
the
attentive
lady
of
the
house
,
or
even
the
attentive
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Woodhouse
little
suspect
what
be
plot
against
him
in
the
breast
of
that
man
whom
he
be
so
cordially
welcoming
,
and
so
anxiously
hope
may
not
have
take
cold
from
his
ride
.
 
<EOS>
Could
he
have
see
the
heart
,
he
would
have
care
very
little
for
the
lung
;
but
without
the
most
distant
imagination
of
the
impending
evil
,
without
the
slight
perception
of
any
thing
extraordinary
in
the
look
or
way
of
either
,
he
repeat
to
them
very
comfortably
all
the
article
of
news
he
have
receive
from
Mr.
Perry
,
and
talk
on
with
much
self
-
contentment
,
totally
unsuspicious
of
what
they
could
have
tell
him
in
return
.
  
<EOS>
as
long
as
Mr.
Knightley
remain
with
them
,
Emma
's
fever
continue
;
but
when
he
be
go
,
she
begin
to
be
a
little
tranquillised
and
subdue
 
and
in
the
course
of
the
sleepless
night
,
which
be
the
tax
for
such
an
evening
,
she
find
one
or
two
such
very
serious
point
to
consider
,
as
make
her
feel
,
that
even
her
happiness
must
have
some
alloy
.
<EOS>
Her
father
 
and
Harriet
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
be
alone
without
feel
the
full
weight
of
their
separate
claim
;
and
how
to
guard
the
comfort
of
both
to
the
utmost
,
be
the
question
.
<EOS>
with
respect
to
her
father
,
it
be
a
question
soon
answer
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
know
yet
what
Mr.
Knightley
would
ask
;
but
a
very
short
parley
with
her
own
heart
produce
the
most
solemn
resolution
of
never
quit
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
She
even
weep
over
the
idea
of
it
,
as
a
sin
of
thought
.
<EOS>
while
he
live
,
it
must
be
only
an
engagement
;
but
she
flatter
herself
,
that
if
divest
of
the
danger
of
draw
her
away
,
it
may
become
an
increase
of
comfort
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
how
to
do
her
good
by
Harriet
,
be
of
more
difficult
decision
;
 
how
to
spare
her
from
any
unnecessary
pain
;
how
to
make
her
any
possible
atonement
;
how
to
appear
least
her
enemy
?
 
<EOS>
on
these
subject
,
her
perplexity
and
distress
be
very
great
 
<EOS>
and
her
mind
have
to
pass
again
and
again
through
every
bitter
reproach
and
sorrowful
regret
that
have
ever
surround
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
only
resolve
at
last
,
that
she
would
still
avoid
a
meeting
with
her
,
and
communicate
all
that
nee
be
tell
by
letter
;
that
it
would
be
inexpressibly
desirable
to
have
her
remove
just
now
for
a
time
from
Highbury
,
and
 
indulge
in
one
scheme
more
 
nearly
resolve
,
that
it
may
be
practicable
to
get
an
invitation
for
her
to
Brunswick
Square
.
 
<EOS>
Isabella
have
be
please
with
Harriet
;
and
a
few
week
spend
in
London
must
give
her
some
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
think
it
in
Harriet
's
nature
to
escape
be
benefit
by
novelty
and
variety
,
by
the
street
,
the
shop
,
and
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
it
would
be
a
proof
of
attention
and
kindness
in
herself
,
from
whom
every
thing
be
due
;
a
separation
for
the
present
;
an
averting
of
the
evil
day
,
when
they
must
all
be
together
again
.
  
<EOS>
She
rise
early
,
and
write
her
letter
to
Harriet
;
an
employment
which
leave
her
so
very
serious
,
so
nearly
sad
,
that
Mr.
Knightley
,
in
walk
up
to
Hartfield
to
breakfast
,
do
not
arrive
at
all
too
soon
;
and
half
an
hour
steal
afterwards
to
go
over
the
same
ground
again
with
him
,
literally
and
figuratively
,
be
quite
necessary
to
reinstate
her
in
a
proper
share
of
the
happiness
of
the
evening
before
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
not
leave
her
long
,
by
no
means
long
enough
for
her
to
have
the
slight
inclination
for
thinking
of
any
body
else
,
when
a
letter
be
bring
her
from
randall
 
a
very
thick
letter
;
 
she
guess
what
it
must
contain
,
and
deprecate
the
necessity
of
read
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
now
in
perfect
charity
with
Frank
Churchill
;
she
want
no
explanation
,
she
want
only
to
have
her
thought
to
herself
 
and
<EOS>
as
for
understand
any
thing
he
write
,
she
be
sure
she
be
incapable
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
wade
through
,
however
.
<EOS>
She
open
the
packet
;
it
be
too
surely
so
;
 
a
note
from
Mrs.
Weston
to
herself
,
usher
in
the
letter
from
Frank
to
Mrs.
Weston
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
the
great
pleasure
,
my
dear
Emma

in
forward
to
you

<EOS>
I
know
what
thorough
justice
you
will
do
it
,
and
have
scarcely
a
doubt
of
its
happy
effect
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
we
shall
never
materially
disagree
about
the
writer
again
;
but
I
will
not
delay
you
by
a
long
preface

<EOS>
We
be
quite
well

<EOS>
this
letter
have
be
the
cure
of
all
the
little
nervousness
I
have
be
feel
lately
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
quite
like
your
look
on
Tuesday

but
it
be
an
ungenial
morning
;
and
though
you
will
never
own
be
affect
by
weather

I
think
every
body
feel
a
north

east

I
feel
for
your
dear

very
much
in
the
storm
of
Tuesday
afternoon
and
yesterday
morning

have
the
comfort
of

last

my
dear

<EOS>
"
if
I
make
myself
intelligible
yesterday
,
this
letter
will
be
expect
;
but
expect
or
not
,
I
know
it
will
be
read
with
candour
and
indulgence
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
all
goodness
,
and
I
believe
there
will
be
need
of
even
all
your
goodness
to
allow
for
some
part
of
my
past
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
be
forgive
by
one
who
have
still
more
to
resent
.
<EOS>
My
courage
rise
while
I
write
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
difficult
for
the
prosperous
to
be
humble
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
meet
with
such
success
in
two
application
for
pardon
,
that
I
may
be
in
danger
of
think
myself
too
sure
of
yours
,
and
of
those
among
your
friend
who
have
have
any
ground
of
offence
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
all
endeavour
to
comprehend
the
exact
nature
of
my
situation
when
I
first
arrive
at
randall
;
you
must
consider
me
as
have
a
secret
which
be
to
be
keep
at
all
hazard
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
fact
.
<EOS>
My
right
to
place
myself
in
a
situation
require
such
concealment
,
be
another
question
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
discuss
it
here
.
<EOS>
for
my
temptation
to
_
think
_
<EOS>
it
a
right
<EOS>
,
I
refer
every
caviller
to
a
brick
house
,
sashe
window
below
,
and
casement
above
,
in
Highbury
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
address
her
openly
;
my
difficulty
in
the
then
state
of
Enscombe
must
be
too
well
known
to
require
definition
;
and
I
be
fortunate
enough
to
prevail
,
before
we
part
at
Weymouth
,
and
to
induce
the
most
upright
female
mind
in
the
creation
to
stoop
in
charity
to
a
secret
engagement
.
 
<EOS>
have
she
refuse
,
I
should
have
go
mad
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
will
be
ready
to
say
,
what
be
your
hope
in
do
this
?
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
look
forward
to
?
 
<EOS>
to
any
thing
,
every
thing
 
to
time
,
chance
,
circumstance
,
slow
effect
,
sudden
burst
,
perseverance
and
weariness
,
health
and
sickness

<EOS>
every
possibility
of
good
be
before
me
,
and
the
first
of
blessing
secure
,
in
obtain
her
promise
of
faith
and
correspondence
.
<EOS>
if
you
need
farther
explanation
,
I
have
the
honour
,
my
dear
madam
,
of
be
your
husband
's
son
,
and
the
advantage
of
inherit
a
disposition
to
hope
for
good
,
which
no
inheritance
of
house
or
land
can
ever
equal
the
value
of
.
 
<EOS>
see
me
,
then
,
under
these
circumstance
,
arrive
on
my
first
visit
to
randall
;
 
and
here
I
be
conscious
of
wrong
,
for
that
visit
may
have
be
sooner
pay
.
<EOS>
You
will
look
back
and
see
that
I
do
not
come
till
Miss
Fairfax
be
in
Highbury
;
and
as
_
you
_
be
the
person
slight
,
you
will
forgive
me
instantly
;
but
I
must
work
on
my
father
's
compassion
,
by
remind
him
,
that
so
long
as
I
absent
myself
from
his
house
,
so
long
I
lose
the
blessing
of
know
you
.
<EOS>
My
behaviour
,
during
the
very
happy
fortnight
which
I
spend
with
you
,
do
not
,
I
hope
,
lie
me
open
to
reprehension
,
except
on
one
point
.
<EOS>
and
now
I
come
to
the
principal
,
the
only
important
part
of
my
conduct
while
belong
to
you
,
which
excite
my
own
anxiety
,
or
require
very
solicitous
explanation
.
<EOS>
with
the
great
respect
,
and
the
warm
friendship
,
do
I
mention
Miss
Woodhouse
;
my
father
perhaps
will
think
I
ought
to
add
,
with
the
deep
humiliation
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
word
which
drop
from
him
yesterday
speak
his
opinion
,
and
some
censure
I
acknowledge
myself
liable
to
.
 
<EOS>
My
behaviour
to
Miss
Woodhouse
indicate
,
I
believe
,
more
than
it
ought
.
 
<EOS>
in
order
to
assist
a
concealment
so
essential
to
me
,
I
be
lead
on
to
make
more
than
an
allowable
use
of
the
sort
of
intimacy
into
which
we
be
immediately
throw
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
deny
that
Miss
Woodhouse
be
my
ostensible
object
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
sure
you
will
believe
the
declaration
,
that
have
I
not
be
convince
of
her
indifference
,
I
would
not
have
be
induce
by
any
selfish
view
to
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
amiable
and
delightful
as
Miss
Woodhouse
be
<EOS>
,
she
never
give
me
the
idea
of
a
young
woman
likely
to
be
attach
;
and
that
she
be
perfectly
free
from
any
tendency
to
be
attach
to
me
,
be
as
much
my
conviction
as
my
wish
.
 
<EOS>
She
receive
my
attention
with
an
easy
,
friendly
,
goodhumoure
playfulness
,
which
exactly
suit
me
.
<EOS>
We
seem
to
understand
each
other
.
<EOS>
from
our
relative
situation
,
those
attention
be
her
due
,
and
be
feel
to
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
whether
Miss
Woodhouse
begin
really
to
understand
me
before
the
expiration
of
that
fortnight
,
I
can
not
say
;
 
when
I
call
to
take
leave
of
her
,
I
remember
that
I
be
within
a
moment
of
confess
the
truth
,
and
I
then
fancy
she
be
not
without
suspicion
;
but
I
have
no
doubt
of
her
have
since
detect
me
,
at
least
in
some
degree
.
 
<EOS>
She
may
not
have
surmise
the
whole
,
but
her
quickness
must
have
penetrate
a
part
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
doubt
it
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
,
whenever
the
subject
become
free
from
its
present
restraint
,
that
it
do
not
take
her
wholly
by
surprize
.
<EOS>
She
frequently
give
me
hint
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
remember
her
tell
me
at
the
ball
,
that
I
owe
Mrs.
Elton
gratitude
for
her
attention
to
Miss
Fairfax
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
this
history
of
my
conduct
towards
her
will
be
admit
by
you
and
my
father
as
great
extenuation
of
what
you
see
amiss
.
<EOS>
while
you
consider
me
as
have
sin
against
Emma
Woodhouse
,
I
could
deserve
nothing
from
either
.
<EOS>
acquit
me
here
,
and
procure
for
me
,
when
it
be
allowable
,
the
acquittal
and
good
wish
of
that
say
Emma
Woodhouse
,
whom
I
regard
with
so
much
brotherly
affection
,
as
to
long
to
have
her
as
deeply
and
as
happily
in
love
as
myself
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
strange
thing
<EOS>
I
say
or
do
during
that
fortnight
<EOS>
,
you
have
now
a
key
to
.
<EOS>
My
heart
be
in
Highbury
,
and
my
business
be
to
get
my
body
thither
as
often
as
may
be
,
and
with
the
least
suspicion
.
<EOS>
if
you
remember
any
queerness
,
set
them
all
to
the
right
account
.
 
<EOS>
of
the
pianoforte
so
much
talk
of
,
I
feel
it
only
necessary
to
say
,
that
its
be
order
be
absolutely
unknown
to
Miss
F
 
<EOS>
,
who
would
never
have
allow
me
to
send
it
,
have
any
choice
be
give
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
delicacy
of
her
mind
throughout
the
whole
engagement
,
my
dear
madam
,
be
much
beyond
my
power
of
do
justice
to
.
<EOS>
You
will
soon
,
I
earnestly
hope
,
know
her
thoroughly
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
no
description
can
describe
her
.
<EOS>
She
must
tell
you
herself
what
she
be
 
yet
not
by
word
,
for
never
be
there
a
human
creature
who
would
so
designedly
suppress
her
own
merit
.
 
<EOS>
since
I
begin
this
letter
,
which
will
be
long
than
I
foresaw
,
I
have
hear
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
give
a
good
account
of
her
own
health
;
but
as
she
never
complain
,
I
dare
not
depend
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
have
your
opinion
of
her
look
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
soon
call
on
her
;
she
be
live
in
dread
of
the
visit
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
pay
already
.
<EOS>
let
me
hear
from
you
without
delay
;
I
be
impatient
for
a
thousand
particular
.
<EOS>
remember
how
few
minute
I
be
at
Randalls
,
and
in
how
bewilder
,
how
mad
a
state
:
and
I
be
not
much
well
yet
;
still
insane
either
from
happiness
or
misery
.
<EOS>
when
I
think
of
the
kindness
and
favour
I
have
meet
with
,
of
her
excellence
and
patience
,
and
my
uncle
's
generosity
,
I
be
mad
with
joy
:
but
when
I
recollect
all
the
uneasiness
I
occasion
her
,
and
how
little
I
deserve
to
be
forgive
,
I
be
mad
with
anger
.
<EOS>
if
I
could
but
see
her
again
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
must
not
propose
it
yet
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
have
be
too
good
for
me
to
encroach
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
still
add
to
this
long
letter
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
hear
all
that
you
ought
to
hear
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
give
any
connected
detail
yesterday
;
but
the
suddenness
,
and
,
in
one
light
,
the
unseasonableness
with
which
the
affair
burst
out
,
need
explanation
;
for
though
the
event
of
the
26th
ult
.
,
as
you
will
conclude
,
immediately
open
to
me
the
happy
prospect
<EOS>
,
I
should
not
have
presume
on
such
early
measure
,
but
from
the
very
particular
circumstance
,
which
leave
me
not
an
hour
to
lose
.
<EOS>
I
should
myself
have
shrink
from
any
thing
so
hasty
,
and
she
would
have
feel
every
scruple
of
mine
with
multiplied
strength
and
refinement
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
no
choice
.
<EOS>
the
hasty
engagement
she
have
enter
into
with
that
woman
 
<EOS>
here
,
my
dear
madam
,
I
be
oblige
to
leave
off
abruptly
,
to
recollect
and
compose
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
walk
over
the
country
,
and
be
now
,
I
hope
,
rational
enough
to
make
the
rest
of
my
letter
what
it
ought
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
,
in
fact
,
a
most
mortifying
retrospect
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
behave
shamefully
.
<EOS>
and
here
I
can
admit
,
that
my
manner
to
Miss
W.
,
in
be
unpleasant
to
Miss
F.
,
be
highly
blameable
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
disapprove
them
,
which
ought
to
have
be
enough
.
 
<EOS>
My
plea
of
conceal
the
truth
she
do
not
think
sufficient
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
displeased
;
I
think
unreasonably
so
:
I
think
her
,
on
a
thousand
occasion
,
unnecessarily
scrupulous
and
cautious
:
I
think
her
even
cold
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
always
right
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
follow
her
judgment
,
and
subdue
my
spirit
to
the
level
of
what
she
deem
proper
,
I
should
have
escape
the
great
unhappiness
I
have
ever
know
.
 
<EOS>
We
quarrel
.
  
<EOS>
do
you
remember
the
morning
spend
at
Donwell
?
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
there
_
<EOS>
every
little
dissatisfaction
that
have
occur
before
come
to
a
crisis
.
<EOS>
I
be
late
;
I
meet
her
walk
home
by
herself
,
and
want
to
walk
with
her
,
but
she
would
not
suffer
it
.
<EOS>
She
absolutely
refuse
to
allow
me
,
which
I
then
think
most
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
I
see
nothing
in
it
but
a
very
natural
and
consistent
degree
of
discretion
.
<EOS>
while
I
,
to
blind
the
world
to
our
engagement
,
be
behave
one
hour
with
objectionable
particularity
to
another
woman
,
be
she
to
be
consent
the
next
to
a
proposal
which
may
have
make
every
previous
caution
useless
?
 
<EOS>
have
we
be
meet
walk
together
between
Donwell
and
Highbury
,
the
truth
must
have
be
suspect
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
mad
enough
,
however
,
to
resent
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
her
affection
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
it
more
the
next
day
on
Box
Hill
;
when
,
provoke
by
such
conduct
on
my
side
,
such
shameful
,
insolent
neglect
of
her
,
and
such
apparent
devotion
to
Miss
W.
,
as
it
would
have
be
impossible
for
any
woman
of
sense
to
endure
,
she
speak
her
resentment
in
a
form
of
word
perfectly
intelligible
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
my
dear
madam
,
it
be
a
quarrel
blameless
on
her
side
,
abominable
on
mine
;
and
I
return
the
same
evening
to
Richmond
,
though
I
may
have
staid
with
you
till
the
next
morning
,
merely
because
I
would
be
as
angry
with
her
as
possible
.
<EOS>
even
then
,
I
be
not
such
a
fool
as
not
to
mean
to
be
reconcile
in
time
;
but
I
be
the
injure
person
,
injure
by
her
coldness
,
and
I
go
away
<EOS>
determine
that
she
should
make
the
first
advance
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
always
congratulate
myself
that
you
be
not
of
the
Box
Hill
party
.
<EOS>
have
you
witness
my
behaviour
there
<EOS>
,
I
can
hardly
suppose
you
would
ever
have
think
well
of
me
again
.
<EOS>
Its
effect
upon
her
appear
in
the
immediate
resolution
it
produce
:
as
soon
as
she
find
I
be
really
go
from
randall
,
she
close
with
the
offer
of
that
officious
Mrs.
Elton
;
the
whole
system
of
whose
treatment
of
her
,
by
the
bye
,
have
ever
fill
me
with
indignation
and
hatred
.
<EOS>
I
must
not
quarrel
with
a
spirit
of
forbearance
which
have
be
so
richly
extended
towards
myself
;
but
,
otherwise
,
I
should
loudly
protest
against
the
share
of
it
which
that
woman
have
know
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
"
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
You
will
observe
that
I
have
not
yet
indulge
myself
in
call
her
by
that
name
,
even
to
you
.
<EOS>
think
,
then
,
what
I
must
have
endure
in
hear
it
bandy
between
the
elton
with
all
the
vulgarity
of
needless
repetition
,
and
all
the
insolence
of
imaginary
superiority
.
<EOS>
have
patience
with
me
,
I
shall
soon
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
She
close
with
this
offer
,
resolve
to
break
with
me
entirely
,
and
write
the
next
day
to
tell
me
that
we
never
be
to
meet
again
.
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
_
feel
_
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
the
_
_
engagement
_
_
<EOS>
to
_
_
be
_
_
<EOS>
a
_
_
source
_
_
of
_
_
repentance
_
_
and
<EOS>
_
_
misery
_
_
to
_
_
<EOS>
each
_
:
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
she
<EOS>
_
_
dissolve
_
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
_
.
 
<EOS>
this
letter
reach
me
on
the
very
morning
of
my
poor
aunt
's
death
.
<EOS>
I
answer
it
within
an
hour
;
but
from
the
confusion
of
my
mind
,
and
the
multiplicity
of
business
fall
on
me
at
once
,
my
answer
,
instead
of
be
send
with
all
the
many
other
letter
of
that
day
,
be
lock
up
in
my
writing
-
desk
;
and
I
,
trust
that
I
have
write
enough
,
though
but
a
few
line
,
to
satisfy
her
,
remain
without
any
uneasiness
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
rather
disappointed
that
I
do
not
hear
from
her
again
speedily
;
but
I
make
excuse
for
her
,
and
be
too
busy
,
and
 
may
I
add
?
 
<EOS>
too
cheerful
in
my
view
to
be
captious
.
 
<EOS>
We
remove
to
Windsor
;
and
two
day
afterwards
I
receive
a
parcel
from
her
,
my
own
letter
all
return
!
 
<EOS>
and
a
few
line
at
the
same
time
by
the
post
,
state
her
extreme
surprize
at
not
have
have
the
small
reply
to
her
last
;
and
add
,
that
as
silence
on
such
a
point
could
not
be
misconstrue
,
<EOS>
and
as
it
must
be
equally
desirable
to
both
to
have
every
subordinate
arrangement
conclude
as
soon
as
possible
,
she
now
send
me
,
by
a
safe
conveyance
,
all
my
letter
,
and
request
,
that
if
I
could
not
directly
command
her
,
so
as
to
send
them
to
Highbury
within
a
week
,
I
would
forward
them
after
that
period
to
her
at
 
:
in
short
,
the
full
direction
to
Mr.
Smallridge
's
,
near
Bristol
,
stare
me
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
name
,
the
place
,
I
know
all
about
it
,
and
instantly
see
what
she
have
be
do
.
<EOS>
It
be
perfectly
accordant
with
that
resolution
of
character
which
I
know
her
to
possess
;
and
the
secrecy
she
have
maintain
,
as
to
any
such
design
in
her
former
letter
,
be
equally
descriptive
of
its
anxious
delicacy
.
<EOS>
for
the
world
would
not
she
have
seem
to
threaten
me
.
 
<EOS>
imagine
the
shock
<EOS>
;
imagine
how
,
till
I
have
actually
detect
my
own
blunder
,
I
rave
at
the
blunder
of
the
post
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
to
be
do
?
 
<EOS>
one
thing
only
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
speak
to
my
uncle
.
<EOS>
without
his
sanction
I
could
not
hope
to
be
listen
to
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
speak
;
circumstance
be
in
my
favour
;
the
late
event
have
soften
away
his
pride
,
and
he
be
,
earlier
than
I
could
have
anticipate
,
wholly
reconcile
and
comply
;
and
could
say
at
last
,
poor
man
!
<EOS>
with
a
deep
sigh
,
that
he
wish
I
may
find
as
much
happiness
in
the
marriage
state
as
he
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
that
it
would
be
of
a
different
sort
.
 
<EOS>
be
you
disposed
to
pity
me
for
what
I
must
have
suffer
in
open
the
cause
to
him
,
for
my
suspense
while
all
be
at
stake
?
 
<EOS>
no
;
do
not
pity
me
till
I
reach
Highbury
,
and
see
how
ill
I
have
make
her
.
<EOS>
do
not
pity
me
till
I
see
her
wan
,
sick
look
.
 
<EOS>
I
reach
Highbury
at
the
time
of
day
when
,
from
my
knowledge
of
their
late
breakfast
hour
,
I
be
certain
of
a
good
chance
of
find
her
alone

<EOS>
I
be
not
disappointed
;
and
at
last
I
be
not
disappoint
either
in
the
object
of
my
journey
.
<EOS>
a
great
deal
of
very
reasonable
,
very
just
displeasure
I
have
to
persuade
away
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
do
;
we
be
reconcile
,
dearer
,
much
dearer
,
than
ever
,
and
no
moment
's
uneasiness
can
ever
occur
between
us
again
.
<EOS>
now
,
my
dear
madam
,
I
will
release
you
;
but
I
could
not
conclude
before
.
<EOS>
a
thousand
and
a
thousand
thank
for
all
the
kindness
you
have
ever

me
,
and
ten
thousand
for
the
attention
your
heart
will
dictate
towards
her
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
think
me
in
a
way
to
be
happy
than
I
deserve
,
I
be
quite
of
your
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
W.

me
the
child
of
good
fortune

<EOS>
I
hope
she
be
right

<EOS>
in
one
respect
,
my
good
fortune

undoubted

CHURCHILL

<EOS>
this
letter
must
make
its
way
to
Emma
's
feeling
.
<EOS>
She
be
oblige
,
in
spite
of
her
previous
determination
to
the
contrary
,
to
do
it
all
the
justice
that
Mrs.
Weston
foretold
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
come
to
her
own
name
,
it
be
irresistible
;
every
line
relate
to
herself
be
interesting
,
and
almost
every
line
agreeable
;
and
when
this
charm
cease
,
the
subject
could
still
maintain
itself
,
by
the
natural
return
of
her
former
regard
for
the
writer
,
and
the
very
strong
attraction
which
any
picture
of
love
must
have
for
her
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
She
never
stopt
till
she
have
go
through
the
whole
;
and
though
it
be
impossible
not
to
feel
that
he
have
be
wrong
,
yet
he
have
be
less
wrong
than
she
have
suppose
 
<EOS>
and
he
have
suffer
,
and
be
very
sorry
 
<EOS>
and
he
be
so
grateful
to
Mrs.
Weston
,
and
so
much
in
love
with
Miss
Fairfax
,
and
she
be
so
happy
herself
,
that
there
be
no
be
severe
;
and
could
he
have
enter
the
room
<EOS>
,
she
must
have
shake
hand
with
him
as
heartily
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
She
think
so
well
of
the
letter
,
that
when
Mr.
Knightley
come
again
,
she
desire
him
to
read
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
sure
of
Mrs.
Weston
's
wish
it
to
be
communicate
;
especially
to
one
,
who
,
like
Mr.
Knightley
,
have
see
so
much
to
blame
in
his
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
very
glad
to
look
it
over
,
"
say
he
;
"
but
it
seem
long
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
it
home
with
me
at
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
that
would
not
do
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
be
to
call
in
the
evening
,
and
she
must
return
it
by
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
be
talk
to
you
,
"
he
reply
;
"
but
as
it
seem
a
matter
of
justice
,
it
shall
be
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
begin
 
stopping
,
however
,
almost
directly
to
say
,
"
have
I
be
offer
the
sight
of
one
of
this
gentleman
's
letter
to
his
mother
-
in
-
law
a
few
month
ago
,
Emma
,
it
would
not
have
be
take
with
such
indifference
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
proceed
a
little
farther
,
read
to
himself
;
and
then
,
with
a
smile
,
observe
,
"
Humph
!
<EOS>
a
fine
complimentary
opening
:
<EOS>
but
it
be
his
way
.
<EOS>
one
man
's
style
must
not
be
the
rule
of
another
be
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
be
severe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
natural
for
me
,
"
he
add
shortly
afterwards
,
"
to
speak
my
opinion
aloud
as
I
read
.
<EOS>
by
do
it
,
I
shall
feel
that
I
be
near
you
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
be
so
great
a
loss
of
time
:
but
if
you
dislike
it
 
"
  
"
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
should
wish
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
return
to
his
reading
with
great
alacrity
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
trifle
here
,
"
say
he
,
"
as
to
the
temptation
.
<EOS>
He
know
he
be
wrong
,
and
have
nothing
rational
to
urge
.
 
<EOS>
Bad
.
 
<EOS>
He
ought
not
to
have
form
the
engagement
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
father
's
disposition
:
"
 
<EOS>
he
be
unjust
,
however
,
to
his
father
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
's
sanguine
temper
be
a
blessing
on
all
his
upright
and
honourable
exertion
;
but
Mr.
Weston
earn
every
present
comfort
before
he
endeavour
to
gain
it
.
 
<EOS>
very
true
;
he
do
not
come
till
Miss
Fairfax
be
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
I
have
not
forget
,
"
say
Emma
,
"
how
sure
you
be
that
he
may
have
come
sooner
if
he
would
.
<EOS>
You
pass
it
over
very
handsomely
 
<EOS>
but
you
be
perfectly
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
quite
impartial
in
my
judgment
,
Emma
:
 
<EOS>
but
yet
,
I
think
 
have
_
<EOS>
you
_
not
be
in
the
case
 
<EOS>
I
should
still
have
distrust
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
he
come
to
Miss
Woodhouse
,
he
be
oblige
to
read
the
whole
of
it
aloud
 
all
that
relate
to
her
,
with
a
smile
;
a
look
;
a
shake
of
the
head
;
a
word
or
two
of
assent
,
or
disapprobation
;
or
merely
of
love
,
as
the
subject
require
;
conclude
,
however
,
seriously
,
and
,
after
steady
reflection
,
thus
    
"
very
bad
 
though
it
may
have
be
bad

<EOS>
play
a
most
dangerous
game
.
<EOS>
too
much
indebted
to
the
event
for
his
acquittal
.
 
<EOS>
no
judge
of
his
own
manner
by
you
.
 
<EOS>
always
deceive
in
fact
by
his
own
wish
,
and
regardless
of
little
besides
his
own
convenience
.
 
<EOS>
fancy
you
to
have
fathom
his
secret
.
<EOS>
natural
enough
!
 
<EOS>
his
own
mind
full
of
intrigue
<EOS>
,
that
he
should
suspect
it
in
other

mystery
;
Finesse
 
<EOS>
how
they
pervert
the
understanding
!
<EOS>
My
Emma
,
do
not
every
thing
serve
to
prove
more
and
more
the
beauty
of
truth
and
sincerity
in
all
our
dealing
with
each
other
?
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
agree
to
it
,
and
with
a
blush
of
sensibility
on
Harriet
's
account
,
which
she
could
not
give
any
sincere
explanation
of
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
go
on
,
"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
so
,
but
very
soon
stopt
again
to
say
,
"
the
pianoforte
!
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
that
be
the
act
of
a
very
,
very
young
man
,
one
too
young
to
consider
whether
the
inconvenience
of
it
may
not
very
much
exceed
the
pleasure
.
<EOS>
a
boyish
scheme
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
comprehend
a
man
's
wish
to
give
a
woman
any
proof
of
affection
which
he
know
she
would
rather
dispense
with
;
and
he
do
know
that
she
would
have
prevent
the
instrument
's
come
if
she
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
after
this
,
he
make
some
progress
without
any
pause
.
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
's
confession
of
have
behave
shamefully
be
the
first
thing
to
call
for
more
than
a
word
in
pass
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
perfectly
agree
with
you
,
sir
,
"
 
be
then
his
remark
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
behave
very
shamefully
.
<EOS>
You
never
write
a
true
line
.
"
<EOS>
and
have
go
through
what
immediately
follow
of
the
basis
of
their
disagreement
,
and
his
persisting
to
act
in
direct
opposition
to
Jane
Fairfax
's
sense
of
right
,
he
make
a
full
pause
to
say
,
"
this
be
very
bad

<EOS>
He
have
induce
her
to
place
herself
,
for
his
sake
,
in
a
situation
of
extreme
difficulty
and
uneasiness
,
and
it
should
have
be
his
first
object
to
prevent
her
from
suffer
unnecessarily
.
 
<EOS>
She
must
have
have
much
more
to
contend
with
,
in
carry
on
the
correspondence
,
than
he
could
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
respect
even
unreasonable
scruple
,
have
there
be
such
;
but
her
be
all
reasonable
.
<EOS>
We
must
look
to
her
one
fault
,
and
remember
that
she
have
do
a
wrong
thing
in
consent
to
the
engagement
,
to
bear
that
she
should
have
be
in
such
a
state
of
punishment

<EOS>
Emma
know
that
he
be
now
get
to
the
Box
Hill
party
,
and
grow
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
Her
own
behaviour
have
be
so
very
improper
!
<EOS>
She
be
deeply
ashamed
,
and
a
little
afraid
of
his
next
look
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
read
,
however
,
steadily
,
attentively
,
and
without
the
small
remark
;
and
,
except
one
momentary
glance
at
her
,
instantly
withdraw
,
in
the
fear
of
give
pain
 
no
remembrance
of
Box
Hill

delicacy

You
do
not

well
satisfied

be
;

still
you
must
,
at

I
hope
you
must

think
the
well
of

yes

certainly

He
have
have
great
fault
,
fault
of
inconsideration
and
thoughtlessness
;
and
I
be
very
much
of
his
opinion
in
think
him
likely
to
be
happy
than
he
deserve

but
still
as
he
be
,
beyond
a
doubt

really
attach
to
Miss
Fairfax

will
soon
,
it
may
be
hope
,
have
the
advantage

be
constantly
with
her

be
very
ready

believe

character
will
improve

acquire
from
her
the
steadiness
and
delicacy
of
principle
that
it
want

now
,
let
me
talk
to
you
of
something
else
.
<EOS>
I
have
another
person
's
interest
at
present
so
much
at
heart
,
that
I
can
not
think
any
longer
about
Frank
Churchill

<EOS>
ever
since
I
leave
you
this
morning
,
Emma
,
my
mind
have
be
hard
at
work
on
one
subject
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
subject
follow
;
it
be
in
plain
,
unaffected
,
gentlemanlike
English
,
such
as
Mr.
Knightley
use
even
to
the
woman
he
be
in
love
with
,
how
to
be
able
to
ask
her
to
marry
him
,
without
attack
the
happiness
of
her
father
.
<EOS>
Emma
's
answer
be
ready
at
the
first
word
.
"
<EOS>
while
her
dear
father
live
,
any
change
of
condition
must
be
impossible
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
never
quit
him
.
<EOS>
"
part
only
of
this
answer
,
however
,
be
admit
.
<EOS>
the
impossibility
of
her
quit
her
father
,
Mr.
Knightley
feel
as
strongly
as
herself
;
but
the
inadmissibility
of
any
other
change
,
he
could
not
agree
to
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
think
it
over
most
deeply
,
most
intently
;
he
have
at
first
hope
to
induce
Mr.
Woodhouse
to
remove
with
her
to
Donwell
;
he
have
want
to
believe
it
feasible
,
but
his
knowledge
of
Mr.
Woodhouse
would
not
suffer
him
to
deceive
himself
long
;
and
now
he
confess
his
persuasion
,
that
such
a
transplantation
would
be
a
risk
of
her
father
's
comfort
,
perhaps
even
of
his
life
,
which
must
not
be
hazard
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodhouse
take
from
Hartfield
!
 
<EOS>
no
,
he
feel
that
it
ought
not
to
be
attempt
.
<EOS>
but
the
plan
which
have
arise
on
the
sacrifice
of
this
,
he
trust
his
dear
<EOS>
Emma
would
not
find
in
any
respect
objectionable
;
it
be
,
that
he
should
be
receive
at
Hartfield
;
that
so
long
as
her
father
's
happiness
in
other
word
his
life
 
require
Hartfield
to
continue
her
home
,
it
should
be
his
likewise
.
  
<EOS>
of
their
all
remove
to
Donwell
,
Emma
have
already
have
her
own
pass
thought
.
<EOS>
like
him
,
she
have
try
the
scheme
and
reject
it
;
but
such
an
alternative
as
this
have
not
occur
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
sensible
of
all
the
affection
it
evince
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
,
in
quit
Donwell
,
he
must
be
sacrifice
a
great
deal
of
independence
of
hour
and
habit
;
that
in
live
constantly
with
her
father
,
and
in
no
house
of
his
own
,
there
would
be
much
,
very
much
,
to
be
bear
with
.
<EOS>
She
promise
to
think
of
it
,
and
advise
him
to
think
of
it
more
;
but
he
be
fully
convince
,
that
no
reflection
could
alter
his
wish
or
his
opinion
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
He
have
give
it
,
he
could
assure
her
,
very
long
and
calm
consideration
;
he
have
be
walk
away
from
William
Larkins
the
whole
morning
,
to
have
his
thought
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
there
be
one
difficulty
unprovided
for
,
"
cry
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
William
Larkins
will
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
You
must
get
his
consent
before
you
ask
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
promise
,
however
,
to
think
of
it
;
and
pretty
nearly
promise
,
moreover
,
to
think
of
it
,
with
the
intention
of
find
it
a
very
good
scheme
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
remarkable
,
that
Emma
,
in
the
many
,
very
many
,
point
of
view
in
which
she
be
now
begin
to
consider
Donwell
Abbey
,
be
never
strike
with
any
sense
of
injury
to
her
nephew
Henry
,
whose
right
as
heir
-
expectant
have
formerly
be
so
tenaciously
regard
.
<EOS>
think
she
must
of
the
possible
difference
to
the
poor
little
boy
;
and
yet
she
only
give
herself
a
saucy
conscious
smile
about
it
,
and
find
amusement
in
detect
the
real
cause
of
that
violent
dislike
of
Mr.
Knightley
's
marry
Jane
Fairfax
,
or
any
body
else
,
which
at
the
time
she
have
wholly
impute
to
the
amiable
solicitude
of
the
sister
and
the
aunt
.
  
<EOS>
this
proposal
of
his
,
this
plan
of
marry
and
continue
at
Hartfield
 
the
more
she
contemplate
it
,
the
more
pleasing
it
become
.
<EOS>
His
evil
seem
to
lessen
,
her
own
advantage
to
increase
,
their
mutual
good
to
outweigh
every
drawback
.
<EOS>
such
a
companion
for
herself
in
the
period
of
anxiety
and
cheerlessness
before
her
!
 
<EOS>
such
a
partner
in
all
those
duty
and
care
to
which
time
must
be
give
increase
of
melancholy
!
  
<EOS>
She
would
have
be
too
happy
but
for
poor
Harriet
;
but
every
blessing
of
her
own
seem
to
involve
and
advance
the
suffering
of
her
friend
,
who
must
now
be
even
exclude
from
Hartfield
.
<EOS>
the
delightful
family
party
which
Emma
be
secure
for
herself
,
poor
Harriet
must
,
in
mere
charitable
caution
,
be
keep
at
a
distance
from
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
a
loser
in
every
way
.
<EOS>
Emma
could
not
deplore
her
future
absence
as
any
deduction
from
her
own
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
in
such
a
party
,
Harriet
would
be
rather
a
dead
weight
than
otherwise
;
but
for
the
poor
girl
herself
,
it
seem
a
peculiarly
cruel
necessity
that
be
to
be
place
her
in
such
a
state
of
unmerited
punishment
.
  
<EOS>
in
time
,
of
course
,
Mr.
Knightley
would
be
forget
,
that
is
,
supplant
;
but
this
could
not
be
expect
to
happen
very
early
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
himself
would
be
do
nothing
to
assist
the
cure
;
 
not
like
Mr.
Elton
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Knightley
,
always
so
kind
,
so
feel
,
<EOS>
so
truly
considerate
for
every
body
,
would
never
deserve
to
be
less
worshipped
than
now
;
and
it
really
be
too
much
to
hope
even
of
Harriet
,
that
she
could
be
in
love
with
more
than
_
three
_
man
in
one
year
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
great
relief
to
Emma
to
find
Harriet
as
desirous
as
herself
to
avoid
a
meeting
.
<EOS>
Their
intercourse
be
painful
enough
by
letter
.
<EOS>
how
much
bad
,
have
they
be
oblige
to
meet
!
  
<EOS>
Harriet
express
herself
very
much
as
may
be
suppose
,
without
reproach
,
or
apparent
sense
of
ill
-
usage
;
and
yet
Emma
fancy
there
be
a
something
of
resentment
,
a
something
border
on
it
in
her
style
,
which
increase
the
desirableness
of
their
be
separate
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
only
her
own
consciousness
;
but
it
seem
as
if
an
angel
only
could
have
be
quite
without
resentment
under
such
a
stroke
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
no
difficulty
in
procure
Isabella
's
invitation
;
and
she
be
fortunate
in
have
a
sufficient
reason
for
ask
it
,
without
resort
to
invention
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
tooth
amiss
.
<EOS>
Harriet
really
wish
,
and
have
wish
some
time
,
to
consult
a
dentist
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
John
Knightley
be
delighted
to
be
of
use
;
any
thing
of
ill
health
be
a
recommendation
to
her
 
and
though
not
so
fond
of
a
dentist
as
of
a
Mr.
Wingfield
,
she
be
quite
eager
to
have
Harriet
under
her
care
.
 
<EOS>
when
it
be
thus
settle
on
her
sister
's
side
,
Emma
propose
it
to
her
friend
,
and
find
her
very
persuadable
.
 
<EOS>
Harriet
be
to
go
;
she
be
invite
for
at
least
a
fortnight
;
she
be
to
be
convey
in
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
carriage
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
all
arrange
,
it
be
all
complete
,
and
Harriet
be
safe
in
Brunswick
Square
.
  
<EOS>
now
Emma
could
,
indeed
,
enjoy
Mr.
Knightley
's
visit
;
now
she
could
talk
,
and
she
could
listen
with
true
happiness
,
unchecked
by
that
sense
of
injustice
,
of
guilt
,
of
something
most
painful
,
which
have
haunt
her
when
remember
<EOS>
how
disappoint
a
heart
be
near
her
,
<EOS>
how
much
might
at
that
moment
,
and
at
a
little
distance
,
be
endure
by
the
feeling
which
she
have
lead
astray
herself
.
  
<EOS>
the
difference
of
Harriet
at
Mrs.
Goddard
's
,
or
in
London
,
make
perhaps
an
unreasonable
difference
in
Emma
's
sensation
;
but
she
could
not
think
of
her
in
London
without
object
of
curiosity
and
employment
,
which
must
be
avert
the
past
,
and
carry
her
out
of
herself
.
  
<EOS>
She
would
not
allow
any
other
anxiety
to
succeed
directly
to
the
place
in
her
mind
which
Harriet
have
occupy
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
communication
before
her
,
one
<EOS>
which
_
<EOS>
she
_
only
could
be
competent
to
make
 
the
confession
of
her
engagement
to
her
father
;
but
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
resolve
to
defer
the
disclosure
till
Mrs.
Weston
be
safe
and
well
.
<EOS>
no
additional
agitation
should
be
throw
at
this
period
among
those
she
love
 
and
<EOS>
the
evil
should
not
act
on
herself
by
anticipation
before
the
appoint
time
.
 
<EOS>
a
fortnight
,
at
least
,
of
leisure
and
peace
of
mind
,
to
crown
every
warm
,
but
more
agitating
,
delight
,
should
be
hers
.
  
<EOS>
She
soon
resolve
,
equally
as
a
duty
and
a
pleasure
,
to
employ
half
an
hour
of
this
holiday
of
spirit
in
call
on
Miss
Fairfax
.
 
<EOS>
She
ought
to
go
 
<EOS>
and
she
be
long
to
see
her
;
<EOS>
the
resemblance
of
their
present
situation
increase
every
other
motive
of
goodwill
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
_
secret
_
satisfaction
;
but
the
consciousness
of
a
similarity
of
prospect
would
certainly
add
to
the
interest
with
which
she
should
attend
to
any
thing
Jane
may
communicate
.
  
<EOS>
She
go
 
<EOS>
she
have
drive
once
unsuccessfully
to
the
door
,
but
have
not
be
into
the
house
since
the
morning
after
Box
Hill
,
when
poor
Jane
have
be
in
such
distress
as
have
fill
her
with
compassion
,
though
all
the
bad
of
her
suffering
have
be
unsuspecte
.
 
<EOS>
the
fear
of
be
still
unwelcome
,
determine
her
,
though
assure
of
their
being
at
home
,
to
wait
in
the
passage
,
and
send
up
her
name
.
 
<EOS>
She
hear
Patty
announce
it
;
but
no
such
bustle
succeed
as
poor
Miss
Bates
have
before
make
so
happily
intelligible
.
 
<EOS>
no
<EOS>
;
she
hear
nothing
but
the
instant
reply
of
,
"
beg
her
to
walk
up
;
"
 
and
a
moment
afterwards
she
be
meet
on
the
stair
by
Jane
herself
,
come
eagerly
forward
,
as
if
no
other
reception
of
her
be
feel
sufficient
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
have
never
see
her
look
<EOS>
so
well
<EOS>
,
so
lovely
,
so
engaging
.
<EOS>
there
be
consciousness
,
animation
,
and
warmth
;
there
be
every
thing
which
her
countenance
or
manner
could
ever
have
want
.
  
<EOS>
She
come
forward
with
an
offer
hand
;
and
say
,
in
a
low
,
but
very
feeling
tone
,
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
most
kind
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
express
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
believe
 
excuse
me
for
be
so
entirely
without
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
be
gratify
,
and
would
soon
have
shew
no
want
of
word
,
if
the
sound
of
Mrs.
Elton
's
voice
from
the
sit
-
room
have
not
check
her
,
and
make
it
expedient
to
compress
all
her
friendly
and
all
her
congratulatory
sensation
into
a
very
,
very
earnest
shake
of
the
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bates
and
Mrs.
Elton
be
together
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bates
be
out
,
which
account
for
the
previous
tranquillity
.
<EOS>
Emma
could
have
wish
Mrs.
Elton
elsewhere
;
but
she
be
in
a
humour
to
have
patience
with
every
body
;
and
as
Mrs.
Elton
meet
her
with
unusual
graciousness
,
she
hope
the
rencontre
would
do
them
no
harm
.
  
<EOS>
She
soon
believe
herself
to
penetrate
Mrs.
Elton
's
thought
,
and
understand
why
she
be
,
like
herself
,
in
happy
spirit
;
it
be
be
in
Miss
Fairfax
's
confidence
,
and
fancy
herself
acquaint
with
what
be
still
a
secret
to
other
people
.
<EOS>
Emma
see
symptom
of
it
immediately
in
the
expression
of
her
face
;
and
while
pay
her
own
compliment
to
Mrs.
Bates
,
and
appear
to
attend
to
the
good
old
lady
's
reply
,
she
see
her
with
a
sort
of
anxious
parade
of
mystery
fold
up
a
letter
which
she
have
apparently
be
read
aloud
to
Miss
Fairfax
,
and
return
it
into
the
purple
and
gold
reticule
by
her
side
,
say
,
with
significant
nod
,
  
<EOS>
"
We
can
finish
this
some
other

<EOS>
You

and
,
in

you

I
only
want
to

You

and
again

on
Emma

merely
turn
her
head
to

could
not

<EOS>
It
be

palpable
display

repeat
on
every
possible
occasion

<EOS>
when
they
have
all
talk
a
little
while
in
harmony
of
the
weather
and
Mrs.
Weston

she
find
herself
abruptly
address

whisper
farther

me

I
may

mistake

I
think
it
answer
so

It

Emma
could
not

be
divert
by
the
perplexity

first
answer

result
<EOS>
,
she
suppose
,
from
doubt
of
what

impatience

It

from
her
great
,
her
more

thankful
delight
towards
Mrs.

a
little
show
of
resentment
towards

from

graciously
overcome

it

louder

the

that

the
pleasure
of
a
call

will
be
a

engaged

Miss

the

his
opinion

upon

Mr.

rather
you

I.

so
many

neglect
them

believe
I
have
not

you

up

happily

He
promise
to
come
to
me

soon

he
could
disengage
himself
from
Knightley

he

shut
up
together

deep
consultation

be
Mr.

go
on
foot

Donwell

He
will
have
a
hot
walk

no

it

Crown

a
regular
meeting

Weston

Cole
will
be
there
too

one
be
apt

speak
only
of
those

fancy
Mr.

every

not
you

the

Emma

I
be
almost
certain
that
the
meeting

not

at
Hartfield

"
oh
!
no

the
meeting

certainly
to

day

the
abrupt
answer
,
which
denote
the
impossibility
of
any
blunder
on
Mrs.
Elton
's
side
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
believe
,
"
she
continue
,
"
this
be
the
most
troublesome
parish
that
ever
be
.
<EOS>
We
never
hear
of
such
thing
at
Maple
Grove
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Your
parish
there
be
small
,
"
say
Jane
.
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
my
dear
,
I
do
not
know
,
for
I
never
hear
the
subject
talk
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
prove
by
the
smallness
of
the
school
,
which
I
have
hear
you
speak
of
,
as
under
the
patronage
of
your
sister
and
Mrs.
Bragge
;
the
only
school
,
and
not
more
than
five
-
and
-
twenty
child

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!

you
clever
creature

that
be
very
true

what
a
think
brain
you
have

I
say
,
Jane

what
a
perfect
character
<EOS>
you
and
I
should
make
,
if
we
could
be
shake
together

My
liveliness

your
solidity
would
produce
perfection

that

perfection

hush
!
 
<EOS>
not
a
word
,
if
you
please

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
seem
an
unnecessary
caution
;
Jane
be
want
to
give
her
word
,
not
to
Mrs.
Elton
,
but
to
Miss
Woodhouse
,
as
the
latter
plainly
see
.
<EOS>
the
wish
of
distinguish
her
,
as
far
as
civility
permit
,
be
very
evident
,
though
it
could
not
often
proceed
beyond
a
look

<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
make
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
His
lady
greet
him
with
some
of
her
sparkle
vivacity

<EOS>
"
very
pretty
,
sir

upon
my
word

to
send
me
on

to
be
an
encumbrance

so
long

you
know
what
a
dutiful

you
have
to

You
know
I

<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
be
so
hot

tired
,
that
all
this
wit
seem
throw
away
.
<EOS>
His
civility
to
the
other
lady
must
be
pay
;
but
his
subsequent
object
be
to
lament
over
himself
for
the
heat
he

suffer

the
walk
he
have
have
for
nothing

he

Knightley

not

very
odd

very
unaccountable

after
the
note
I
send
him
this
morning

he
return

no

no

I
particularly
want
to
see
Knightley
to
-
day
on
that
very
account

<EOS>
such
a
dreadful
broiling
morning
!
 
<EOS>
I
go
over
the
field
too
 
(
speak
in
a
tone
of
great
ill
-
usage

make
it
so
much
the
bad

not

him
at
home

I
assure
you
I
be

no

no

the

very
extraordinary

nobody
know
at
all
which
way
he
be
go

perhaps
to
Hartfield
,
perhaps
to
the
Abbey
Mill
,
perhaps
into
his
wood
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Woodhouse
,
this
be
not
like
our
friend
Knightley
!
 
<EOS>
Can
you
explain
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
amuse
herself
by
protest
that
it
be
very
extraordinary
,
indeed
,
and
that
she
have
not
a
syllable
to
say
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
imagine
,
"
say
Mrs.
Elton
,
(
feel
the
indignity
as
a
wife
ought
to
do
,
)
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
imagine
how
he
could
do
such
a
thing
by
you

of
all
people
in
the
world

the
very
last
person

one
should
expect
to

My
dear
Mr.
E.

he
must
have
leave
a
message
for
you
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
he
must
.
 
<EOS>
not
even
Knightley
could
be
so
very
eccentric
;
 
and
his
servant
forget
it
.
<EOS>
depend
upon
it
,
that
be
the
case
:
and
very
likely
to
happen
with
the
Donwell
servant
,
who
be
all
,
I
have
often
observe
,
extremely
awkward
and
remiss
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
would
not
have
such
a
creature
as
his
Harry
stand
at
our
sideboard
for
any
consideration
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
Mrs.
Hodges
,
Wright
hold
her
very
cheap
indeed

She
promise
Wright
a
receipt

never

it

<EOS>
"
I
meet
William
Larkins
,
"
continue
Mr.
Elton
,
"
as
I
get
near
the
house
,
and
he
tell
me
I
should
not
find
his
master
at
home

I
do
not
believe
him

William
seem
rather
out
of
humour

He
do
not

what
be
come
to
his

he
say
,

he
could
hardly

the
speech

him

I
have
nothing
to
do
with
William

it
really
be
of
very
great
importance
that
_
I
_
should
see
Knightley
to
-
day

it
become
a
matter
,
therefore
,
of
very
serious
inconvenience
that
I
should
have
have
this
hot
walk
to
no
purpose

"
  
<EOS>
Emma
feel
that
she
could
not
do
better
than
go
home
directly
.
<EOS>
in
all
probability
she
be
at
this
very
time
wait
for
there

Mr.
Knightley
may
be
preserve
from
sink
deeper
in
aggression
towards
Mr.
Elton

not
towards
William
Larkins

She
be
pleased

on
take
leave

to
find
Miss
Fairfax
determine
to
attend
her
out
of
the
room
,
to
go
with
her
even
downstairs
;
it
give
her
an
opportunity

she
immediately
make
use
of

to
say
,

very

comfort
to
Mr.
Weston

grow
old

grow

enliven
by
the
sport

the
nonsense

the
freak

the
fancy
of
a
child
never
banish
from
home

and
Mrs.
Weston
 
no
one
could
doubt
that
a
daughter
would
be
most
to
her
;

it
would
be
quite
a

that

to
the
advice

would
have
save
her
from
the
bad
of
all
her
womanly
folly
 
<EOS>
her
wilful
intimacy
with
Harriet

<EOS>
it
be
too
tender
a
subject

<EOS>
She
could
not

on

<EOS>
Harriet
be
very
seldom
mention

<EOS>
this
,
on

side

may
merely
proceed
from
her
not
be
think
of
;
but
Emma
be
rather
inclined
to
attribute
it
to
delicacy
,
and
a
suspicion
,
from
some
appearance
,
that
their
friendship
be
decline
.
<EOS>
She
be
aware
herself
,
that
,
part
under
any
other
circumstance
,
they
certainly
should
have
correspond
more
,
and
that
her
intelligence
would
not
have
rest
,
as
it
now
almost
wholly
do
,
on
Isabella

letter

<EOS>
He
may
observe
that
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
the
pain
of
be
oblige
to
practise
concealment
towards
him
,
be
very
little
inferior
to
the
pain
of
have
make
Harriet
unhappy

<EOS>
Isabella
send
quite
as
good
an
account
of
her
visitor
as
could
be
expect
;
on
her
first
arrival
she
have
think
her
out
of
spirit
,
which
appear
perfectly
natural
,
as
there
be
a
dentist
to
be
consult
;
but
,
since
that
business
have
be
over
,
she
do
not
appear
to
find
Harriet
different
from
what
she
have
know
her
before

<EOS>
Isabella
,
to
be
sure
,
be
no
very
quick
observer
;
yet
if
Harriet
have
not

equal
to

with
the
child

it
would
not
have
escape
her
.
<EOS>
Emma
's
comfort
and
hope
be
most
agreeably
carry
on
,
by
Harriet

be
to
stay
longer

her
fortnight
be
likely
to

a
month
at

prepare
him
first

his
consent

obtain
 
which

she

plan

promote
the

Hartfield

She
be
remind

more
than

continual
repetition

<EOS>
to
Emma
's
entreaty
and
assurance
succeed
Mr.
Knightley
's
,
whose
fond
praise
of
her
give
the
subject
even
a
kind
of
welcome
;
and
he
be
soon
use
to
be
talk
to
by
each
,
on
every
fair
occasion

<EOS>
They
have
all
the
assistance
which
Isabella
could
give
,
by
letter
of
the
strong
approbation
;
and
Mrs.
Weston
be
ready
,
on
the
first
meeting
,
to
consider
the
subject
in
the
most
serviceable
light
 
first
,
as
a
settle
,
and
,
secondly
,
as
a
good
one
 
<EOS>
well
aware
of
the
nearly
equal
importance
of
the
two
recommendation
to
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
agree
upon
,
as
what
be
to
be
;
and
every
body
by
whom
he
be
use
to
be
guide
assure
him
that
it
would
be
for
his
happiness
;
and
have
some
feeling
himself
which
almost
admit
it
,
he
begin
to
think
that
some
time
or
other
 
in
another
year
or
two
,
perhaps
 
it
may
not
be
so
very
bad
if
the
marriage
do
take
place
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
be
act
no
part
,
feign
no
feeling
in
all
that
she
say
to
him
in
favour
of
the
event
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
extremely
surprize
,
never
more
so
,
than
when
Emma
first
open
the
affair
to
her
;
but
she
see
in
it
only
increase
of
happiness
to
all
,
and
have
no
scruple
in
urge
him
to
the
utmost
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
such
a
regard
for
Mr.
Knightley
,
as
to
think
he
deserve
even
her
dear
Emma
;
and
it
be
in
every
respect
so
proper
,
suitable
,
and
unexceptionable
a
connexion
,
and
in
one
respect
,
one
point
of
the
high
importance
,
so
peculiarly
eligible
,
so
singularly
fortunate
,
that
now
it
seem
as
if
Emma
could
not
safely
have
attach
herself
to
any
other
creature
,
and
that
she
have
herself
be
the
stupid
of
being
in
not
have
thought
of
it
,
and
wish
it
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
how
very
few
of
those
man
in
a
rank
of
life
to
address
Emma
would
have
renounce
their
own
home
for
Hartfield
!
<EOS>
and
who
but
Mr.
Knightley
could
know
and
bear
with
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
so
as
to
make
such
an
arrangement
desirable
!
 
<EOS>
the
difficulty
of
dispose
of
poor
Mr.
Woodhouse
have
be
always
feel
in
her
husband
's
plan
and
her
own
,
for
a
marriage
between
Frank
and
Emma
.
<EOS>
how
to
settle
the
claim
of
Enscombe
and
Hartfield
have
be
a
continual
impediment
 
less
acknowledge
by
Mr.
Weston
than
by
herself
 
<EOS>
but
even
he
have
never
be
able
to
finish
the
subject
better
than
by
say
 
"
those
matter
will
take
care
of
themselves
;
the
young
people
will
find
a
way
.
<EOS>
"
but
here
there
be
nothing
to
be
shift
off
in
a
wild
speculation
on
the
future
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
right
,
all
open
,
all
equal
.
<EOS>
no
sacrifice
on
any
side
worth
the
name
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
union
of
the
high
promise
of
felicity
in
itself
,
and
without
one
real
,
rational
difficulty
to
oppose
or
delay
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
,
with
her
baby
on
her
knee
,
indulge
in
such
reflection
as
these
,
be
one
of
the
happy
woman
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
if
any
thing
could
increase
her
delight
,
it
be
perceive
that
the
baby
would
soon
have
outgrow
its
first
set
of
cap
.
  
<EOS>
the
news
be
universally
a
surprize
wherever
it
spread
;
and
Mr.
Weston
have
his
five
minute
share
of
it
;
but
five
minute
be
enough
to
familiarise
the
idea
to
his
quickness
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
the
advantage
of
the
match
,
and
rejoice
in
them
with
all
the
constancy
of
his
wife
;
but
the
wonder
of
it
be
very
soon
nothing
;
and
by
the
end
of
an
hour
he
be
not
far
from
believe
that
he
have
always
foresee
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
to
be
a
secret
,
I
conclude
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
these
matter
be
always
a
secret
,
till
it
be
find
out
that
every
body
know
them
.
<EOS>
only
let
me
be
tell
when
I
may
speak
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
Jane
have
any
suspicion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
go
to
Highbury
the
next
morning
,
and
satisfy
himself
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
He
tell
her
the
news
.
<EOS>
be
not
she
like
a
daughter
,
his
eld
daughter
?
 
<EOS>
he
must
tell
her
;
and
Miss
Bates
be
present
,
it
pass
,
of
course
,
to
Mrs.
Cole
,
Mrs.
Perry
,
and
Mrs.
Elton
,
immediately
afterwards
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
more
than
the
principal
be
prepare
for
;
they
have
calculate
from
the
time
of
its
be
know
at
randall
,
how
soon
it
would
be
over
Highbury
;
and
be
think
of
themselves
,
as
the
evening
wonder
in
many
a
family
circle
,
with
great
sagacity
.
  
<EOS>
in
general
,
it
be
a
very
well
approve
match
.
<EOS>
some
may
think
him
,
and
other
may
think
her
,
the
most
in
luck
.
<EOS>
one
set
may
recommend
their
all
remove
to
Donwell
,
and
leave
Hartfield
for
the
John
Knightleys
;
and
another
may
predict
disagreement
among
their
servant
;
but
yet
,
upon
the
whole
,
there
be
no
serious
objection
raise
,
except
in
one
habitation
,
the
Vicarage
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
the
surprize
be
not
soften
by
any
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Elton
care
little
about
it
,
compare
with
his
wife
;
he
only
hope
"
the
young
lady
's
pride
would
now
be
content
;
"
and
suppose
"
she
have
always
mean
to
catch
Knightley
if
she
could
;
"
and
,
on
the
point
of
live
at
Hartfield
,
could
daringly
exclaim
,
"
rather
he
than
I
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Elton
be
very
much
discompose
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
Knightley
!
<EOS>
poor
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
sad
business
for
him

"
 
<EOS>
She
be
extremely
concerned
;
for

though
very
eccentric
,
he
have
a
thousand
good
quality
.
 
<EOS>
how
could
he
be
so
take
in
?
 
<EOS>
do
not
think
him
at
all
in
love
 
not
in
the
least
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Knightley
!
 
<EOS>
there
would
be
an
end
of
all
pleasant
intercourse
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
how
happy
he
have
be
to
come
and
dine
with
them
whenever
they
ask
him
!
<EOS>
but
that
would
be
all
over
now

<EOS>
poor
fellow

<EOS>
no
more
explore
party
to
Donwell

there
would
be
a
Mrs.
Knightley
to
throw
cold
water
on
every
thing
.
 
<EOS>
extremely
disagreeable
!
<EOS>
but
she
be
not
at

sorry
that
she

<EOS>
shocking

It

She

Time

the

It
be
an
alarming
change

It

You

His
good
sense
and
good
principle
would
delight
you
.
 
<EOS>
as
far
as
the
man
be
concern
,
you
could
not
wish
your
friend
in
well
hand
.
<EOS>
His
rank
in
society
I
would
alter
if
I
could
,
which
be
say
a
great
deal
I
assure
you
,
Emma
.
 
<EOS>
You
laugh
at
me
about
William
Larkins
;
but
I
could
quite
as
ill
spare
Robert
Martin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
want
her
to
look
up
and
smile
;
and
have
now
bring
herself
not
to
smile
too
broadly
 
<EOS>
she
do
 
cheerfully
answer
,
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
be
at
any
pain
to
reconcile
me
to
the
match

<EOS>
I
think
Harriet
be
do
extremely
well

<EOS>
Her

be
bad

his

can
be
no

that
they
be

I
have
be
silent
from
surprize
merely
,
excessive
surprize

<EOS>
You
can
not
imagine
how
suddenly
it
have
come
on
me
!
<EOS>
how
peculiarly
unprepared
I
be
!
 
<EOS>
for
I
have
reason
to
believe
her
very
lately
more
determined
against
him
,
much
more
,
than
she
be
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ought
to
know
your
friend
best
,
"
reply
Mr.
Knightley
;
"
but
I
should
say
she
be
a
good
-
temper
,
soft
-
hearted
girl
,
not
likely
to
be
very
,
very
determined
against
any
young
man
who
tell
her
he
love
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
could
not
help
laugh
as
she
answer
,
"
upon
my
word
,
I
believe
you
know
her
quite
as
well
as
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
Mr.
Knightley
,
be
you
perfectly
sure
that
she
have
absolutely
and
downright
_
accept
_
him
.
<EOS>
I
could
suppose
she
may
in
time
 
<EOS>
but
can
she
already
?
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
misunderstand
him
?
 
<EOS>
You
be
both
talk
of
other
thing
;
of
business
,
show
of
cattle
,
or
new
drill
 
and
may
not
you
,
in
the
confusion
of
so
many
subject
,
mistake
him
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
Harriet
's
hand
that
he
be
certain
of
 
<EOS>
it
be
the
dimension
of
some
famous
ox
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
contrast
between
the
countenance
and
air
of
Mr.
Knightley
and
Robert
Martin
be
,
at
this
moment
,
so
strong
to
Emma
's
feeling
,
and
so
strong
be
the
recollection
of
all
that
have
so
recently
pass
on
Harriet
's
side
,
so
fresh
<EOS>
the
sound
of
those
word
,
speak
with
such
emphasis
,
"
<EOS>
no
,
I
hope
I
know
better
than
to
think
of
Robert
Martin
,

that
she
be
really
expect
the
intelligence
to
prove
,
in
some
measure
,
premature
.
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
otherwise

<EOS>
"
do
you
dare
say
this
?
"
cry
Mr.
Knightley
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
dare
to
suppose
me
so
great
a
blockhead

you

oh
!
I
always
deserve
the
good
treatment

because
I
never
put
up

therefore
,
you
must
give
me
a
plain
,
direct
answer

you
quite
sure
that
you
understand
the
term
on
which
Mr.

and
Harriet
now
be

<EOS>
"
I
be
quite
sure

he
reply
,
speak
very
distinctly

that
he
tell
me
she
have
accept
him
;
and
that
there
be
no
obscurity
,
nothing
doubtful
,
in
the
word
he
use
;
and
I
think
I
can
give
you
a
proof
that
it
must
be
so
.
<EOS>
He
ask
my
opinion
as
to
what
he
be
now
to
do
.
<EOS>
He
know
of
no
one
but
Mrs.
Goddard
to
whom
he
could
apply
for
information
of
her
relation

friend

<EOS>
Could
I
mention
any

more
fit

do

than
to
go
to
Mrs.
Goddard
?
<EOS>
I
assure
him
that
I
could
not
.
<EOS>
then
,
he
say
,
he
would
endeavour
to
see
her
in
the
course
of
this
day

<EOS>

I
be
perfectly
satisfied

Emma

with
the
bright
smile

most
sincerely
wish

happy

You

materially
change

I

<EOS>
so
 
for
at

a
fool

<EOS>

and
I
be
change
also
;
for
I
be
now
very
willing
to
grant
you
all
Harriet

good
quality
.
<EOS>
I
have
take
some
pain
for
your

for
Robert

sake
,
(
whom
I
have
always
have
reason
to
believe
as
much
in
love
with
her
as
ever

to
get
acquaint
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
talk
to
her
a
good
deal
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
see
that
I
do
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
indeed
,
I
have
think
you
be
half
suspect
me
of
plead
poor
Martin
's
cause
,
which
be
never
the
case
;
but
,
from
all
my
observation
,
I
be
convince
of
her
be
an
artless
,
amiable
girl
,
with
very
good
notion
,
very
seriously
good
principle
,
and
place
her
happiness
in
the
affection
and
utility
of
domestic
life
.
 
<EOS>
much
of
this
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
she
may
thank
you
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Me
!

<EOS>
cry
Emma
,
shake
her
head

<EOS>
"
ah
!
poor
Harriet
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
check
herself
,
however
,
and
submit
quietly
to
a
little
more
praise
than
she
deserve
.
  
<EOS>
Their
conversation
be
soon
afterwards
close
by
the
entrance
of
her
father
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
sorry
.
<EOS>
She
want
to
be
alone
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
be
in
a
state
of
flutter
and
wonder
,
which
make
it
impossible
for
her
to
be
collect
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
dancing
,
singe
,
exclaim
spirit
;
and
till
she
have
move
about
,
and
talk
to
herself
,
and
laugh
and
reflect
,
she
could
be
fit
for
nothing
rational
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
's
business
be
to
announce
James
's
be
go
out
to
put
the
horse
to
,
preparatory
to
their
now
daily
drive
to
randall
;
and
she
have
,
therefore
,
an
immediate
excuse
for
disappearing
.
  
<EOS>
the
joy
,
the
gratitude
,
the
exquisite
delight
of
her
sensation
may
be
imagine
.
<EOS>
the
sole
grievance
and
alloy
thus
remove
in
the
prospect
of
Harriet
's
welfare
,
she
be
really
in
danger
of
become
too
happy
for
security
.
 
<EOS>
what
have
she
to
wish
for
?
<EOS>
nothing
,
but
to
grow
more
worthy
of
him
,
whose
intention
and
judgment
have
be
ever
so
superior
to
her
own
.
<EOS>
nothing
,
but
that
the
lesson
of
her
past
folly
may
teach
her
humility
and
circumspection
in
future
.
  
<EOS>
serious
she
be
,
very
serious
in
her
thankfulness
,
and
in
her
resolution
;
and
<EOS>
yet
there
be
no
prevent
a
laugh
,
sometimes
in
the
very
midst
of
them
.
<EOS>
She
must
laugh
at
such
a
close
!
<EOS>
such
an
end
of
the
doleful
disappointment
of
five
week
back
!
<EOS>
such
a
heart
 
such
a
Harriet
!
  
<EOS>
now
there
would
be
pleasure
in
her
return
 
<EOS>
every
thing
would
be
a
pleasure
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
great
pleasure
to
know
Robert
Martin
.
  
<EOS>
high
in
the
rank
of
her
most
serious
and
heartfelt
felicity
,
be
the
reflection
that
all
necessity
of
concealment
from
Mr.
Knightley
would
soon
be
over
.
<EOS>
the
disguise
,
equivocation
,
mystery
,
so
hateful
to
her
to
practise
,
may
soon
be
over
.
<EOS>
She
could
now
look
forward
to
give
him
that
full
and
perfect
confidence
which
her
disposition
be
most
ready
to
welcome
as
a
duty
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
gay
and
happy
spirit
she
set
forward
with
her
father
;
not
always
listen
,
but
always
agree
to
what
he
say
;
and
,
whether
in
speech
or
silence
,
connive
at
the
comfortable
persuasion
of
his
be
oblige
to
go
to
randall
every
day
,
or
poor
Mrs.
Weston
would
be
disappoint
.
  
<EOS>
They
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
be
alone
in
the
drawing
-
room
:
 
but
hardly
have
they
be
tell
of
the
baby
,
and
Mr.
Woodhouse
receive
the
thank
for
come
,
which
he
ask
for
,
when
a
glimpse
be
catch
through
the
blind

of
two
figure
pass
near
the
window

"
It

Frank

Miss
Fairfax

Mrs.
Weston

I
be
just

you
of
our
agreeable
surprize
in

this
morning

He
stay
till
to

morrow
,
and
Miss
Fairfax
have
be
persuade
to
spend
the
day
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
come
in
,
I
hope

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
half
a
minute
they
be
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
Emma
be
extremely
glad
to
see
him
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
degree
of
confusion
 
<EOS>
a
number
of
embarrassing
recollection
on
each
side
.
<EOS>
They
meet
readily
and
smile
,
but
with
a
consciousness
which
at
first
allow
little
to
be
say
;
and
have
all
sit
down
again
,
there
be
for
some
time
such
a
blank
in
the
circle
,
that
Emma
begin
to
doubt
whether
the
wish
now
indulge
,
which
she
have
long
feel
,
of
see
Frank
Churchill
once
more
,
and
of
see
him
with
Jane
,
would
yield
its
proportion
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Weston
join
the
party
,
however
,
and
when
the
baby
be
fetch
,
there
be
no
longer
a
want
of
subject
or
animation
 
or
of
courage
and
opportunity
for
Frank
Churchill
to
draw
near
her
and
say
,
  
"
I
have
to
thank
you
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
for
a
very
kind
forgiving
message
in
one
of
Mrs.
Weston

letter
.
<EOS>
I
hope
time
have
not
make
you
less
willing
to
pardon
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
do
not
retract
what
you
then
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
no

indeed

cry
Emma
,
most
happy
to
begin
,
"
not
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
I
be
particularly
glad
to
see
and
shake
hand
with
you
 
and
to
give
you
joy
in
person
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
thank
her
with
all
his
heart
,
and
continue
some
time
to
speak
with
serious
feeling
of
his
gratitude
and
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
not
she
look
well
?
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
turn
his
eye
towards
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
than
she
ever

<EOS>
You
see
how
my
father
and
Mrs.
Weston
doat
upon
her
.

<EOS>
but
his
spirit
be
soon
rise
again
,
and
with
laugh
eye
,
after
mention
the
expect
return
of
the
Campbells

Dixon

Emma
blush
,
and
forbid
its
be
pronounce
in
her
hearing

<EOS>
"
I
can
never

of
it

she
cry

without
extreme
shame

he
answer
,
"
be
all
mine

near

have
be
well

very
bad

no

the
bond

<EOS>

It
be
not

Emma

<EOS>
Emma
speak
her
pity
so
very
kindly
,
that
with
a
sudden
accession
of
gay
thought
,
he
cry
,
  
"
ah

by
the
bye

then
sink
his
voice

demure

Emma
be
delighted
,

only
want
him
to
go
on
in
the

style

but
his
mind
be
the
next
moment
in
his
own
concern
and
with
his
own
Jane

and
his
next
word
be
,
  
"
do
you
ever

such
a

such
smoothness

such
delicacy

yet
without
be
actually
fair

<EOS>
one
can
not
call
her
fair

It
be
a
most
uncommon
complexion

with
her
dark
eye

lash
and
hair
 
a
most
distinguishing
complexion

so
peculiarly
the
lady
in
it

just
colour
enough
for
beauty

I
have
always
admire
her
complexion

Emma
,
archly
;

do
not
I
remember
the
time

you
find
fault
with
her
for

so
pale

he
laugh
so
heartily
at
the
recollection

that
Emma
could
not
help
say
,
  
"
I
do
suspect
that
in
the
midst
of
your
perplexity
at
that
time
,
you
have
very
great
amusement
in
trick
us
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
have
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
it
be
a
consolation
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
no
,
no
,
no
 
<EOS>
how
can
you
suspect
me
of
such
a
thing
?
<EOS>
I
be
the
most
miserable
wretch
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
quite
so
miserable
as
to
be
insensible
to
mirth
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
it
be
a
source
of
high
entertainment
to
you
,
to
feel
that
you
be
take
us
all
in
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
I
be
the
ready
to
suspect
,
because
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
think
it
may
have
be
some
amusement
to
myself
in
the
same
situation
.
<EOS>
I
think
there
be
a
little
likeness
between
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
bow
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
not
in
our
disposition
,
"
she
presently
add
,
with
a
look
of
true
sensibility
,
"
there
be
a
likeness
in
our
destiny
;
the
destiny
which
bid
fair
to
connect
us
with
two
character
so
much
superior
to
our
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
true
,
true
,
"
he
answer
,
warmly
.
"
<EOS>
no
,
not
true
on
your
side
.
<EOS>
You
can
have
no
superior
,
but
most
true
on
mine
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
complete
angel
.
<EOS>
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
be
not
she
an
angel
in
every
gesture
?
<EOS>
observe
the
turn
of
her
throat
.
<EOS>
observe
her
eye
,
as
she
be
look
up
at
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
be
glad
to
hear
(
incline
his
head
,
and
whisper
seriously
)
that
my
uncle
mean
to
give
her
all
my
aunt
's
jewel
.
<EOS>
They
be
to
be
new
set
.
<EOS>
I
be
resolve
to
have
some
in
an
ornament
for
the
head
.
<EOS>
Will
not
it
be
beautiful
in
her
dark
hair
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
very
beautiful
,
indeed
,
"
reply
Emma
;
and
she
speak
so
kindly
,
that
he
gratefully
burst
out
,
  
<EOS>
"
how
delighted
I
be
to
see
you
again
!
<EOS>
and
to
see
you
in
such
excellent
look
!
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
miss
this
meeting
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
should
certainly
have
call
at
Hartfield
,
have
you
fail
to
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
other
have
be
talk
of
the
child
,
Mrs.
Weston
give
an
account
of
a
little
alarm
she
have
be
under
,
the
evening
before
,
from
the
infant
's
appear
not
quite
well
.
<EOS>
She
believe
she
have
be
foolish
,
but
it
have
alarm
her
,
and
she
have
be
within
half
a
minute
of
send
for
Mr.
Perry
.
<EOS>
perhaps
she
ought
to
be
ashamed
,
but
Mr.
Weston
have
be
almost
as
uneasy
as
herself
.
 
<EOS>
in
ten
minute
,
however
,
the
child
have
be
perfectly
well
again
.
<EOS>
this
be
her
history
;
and
particularly
interesting
it
be
to
Mr.
Woodhouse
,
who
commend
her
very
much
for
think
of
send
for
Perry
,
and
only
regret
that
she
have
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
She
should
always
send
for
Perry
,
if
the
child
appear
in
the
slight
degree
disorder
,
be
it
only
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
be
too
soon
alarm
,
nor
send
for
Perry
too
often
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
,
perhaps
,
that
he
have
not
come
last
night
;
for
,
though
the
child
seem
well
now
,
very
well
consider
,
it
would
probably
have
be
well
if
Perry
have
see
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
Churchill
catch
the
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perry
!
"
say
he
to
Emma
,
and
try
,
as
he
speak
,
to
catch
Miss
Fairfax
's
eye
.
<EOS>
"
My
friend
Mr.
Perry
!
<EOS>
what
be
they
say
about
Mr.
Perry
?
 
<EOS>
have
he
be
here
this
morning
?
 
<EOS>
and
how
do
he
travel
now
?
 
<EOS>
have
he
set
up
his
carriage
?
"
  
<EOS>
Emma
soon
recollect
,
and
understand
him
;
and
while
she
join
in
the
laugh
,
it
be
evident
from
Jane
's
countenance
that
she
too
be
really
hear
him
,
though
try
to
seem
deaf
.
  
<EOS>
"
such
an
extraordinary
dream
of
mine
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
never
think
of
it
without
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
She
hear
us
,
she
hear
us
,
Miss
Woodhouse
.
<EOS>
I
see
it
in
her
cheek
,
her
smile
,
her
vain
attempt
to
frown
.
<EOS>
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
see
that
,
at
this
instant
,
the
very
passage
of
her
own
letter
,
which
send
me
the
report
,
be
pass
under
her
eye
 
that
the
whole
blunder
be
spread
before
her
 
that
she
can
attend
to
nothing
else
,
though
pretend
to
listen
to
the
other

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jane
be
force
to
smile
completely
,
for
a
moment
;
and
the
smile
partly
remain
as
she
turn
towards
him
,
and
say
in
a
conscious
,
low
,
yet
steady
voice
,
  
<EOS>
"
how
you
can
bear
such
recollection
,
be
astonishing
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
They
_
will
_
sometimes
obtrude
 
<EOS>
but
how
you
can
court
them
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
a
great
deal
to
say
in
return
,
and
very
entertainingly
;
but
Emma
's
feeling
be
chiefly
with
Jane
,
in
the
argument
;
and
on
leave
randall
,
and
fall
naturally
into
a
comparison
of
the
two
man
,
she
feel
,
that
please
as
she
have
be
to
see
Frank
Churchill
,
and
really
regard
him
as
she
do
with
friendship
,
she
have
never
be
more
sensible
of
Mr.
Knightley
's
high
superiority
of
character
.
<EOS>
the
happiness
of
this
most
happy
day
,
receive
its
completion
,
in
the
animated
contemplation
of
his
worth
which
this
comparison
produce
.
    
<EOS>
if
Emma
have
still
,
at
interval
,
an
anxious
feeling
for
Harriet
,
a
momentary
doubt
of
its
be
possible
for
her
to
be
really
cure
of
her
attachment
to
Mr.
Knightley
,
and
really
able
to
accept
another
man
from
unbiased
inclination
,
it
be
not
long
that
she
have
to
suffer
from
the
recurrence
of
any
such
uncertainty
.
<EOS>
a
very
few
day
bring
the
party
from
London
,
and
she
have
no
sooner
an
opportunity
of
be
one
hour
alone
with
Harriet
,
than
she
become
perfectly
satisfied
 
unaccountable
as
it
be
!
 
<EOS>
that
Robert
Martin
have
thoroughly
supplant
Mr.
Knightley
,
and
be
now
form
all
her
view
of
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
be
a
little
distressed
 
<EOS>
do
look
a
little
foolish
at
first
:
but
have
once
own
that
she
have
be
presumptuous
and
silly
,
and
self
-
deceive
,
before
,
her
pain
and
confusion
seem
to
die
away
with
the
word
,
and
leave
her
without
a
care
for
the
past
,
and
with
the
full
exultation
in
the
present
and
future
;
for
,
as
to
her
friend
's
approbation
,
Emma
have
instantly
remove
every
fear
of
that
nature
,
by
meet
her
with
the
most
unqualified
congratulation
.
 
<EOS>
Harriet
be
most
happy
to
give
every
particular
of
the
evening
at
Astley
's
,
and
the
dinner
the
next
day
;
she
could
dwell
on
it
all
with
the
utmost
delight
.
<EOS>
but
what
do
such
particular
explain
?
 
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
as
Emma
could
now
acknowledge
,
that
Harriet
have
always
like
Robert
Martin
;
and
that
his
continue
to
love
her
have
be
irresistible
.
 
<EOS>
beyond
this
,
it
must
ever
be
unintelligible
to
Emma
.
  
<EOS>
the
event
,
however
,
be
most
joyful
;
and
every
day
be
give
her
fresh
reason
for
thinking
so
.
 
<EOS>
Harriet
's
parentage
become
known
.
<EOS>
She
prove
to
be
the
daughter
of
a
tradesman
,
rich
enough
to
afford
her
the
comfortable
maintenance
which
have
ever
be
her
,
and
decent
enough
to
have
always
wish
for
concealment
.
 
<EOS>
such
be
the
blood
of
gentility
which
Emma
have
formerly
be
so
ready
to
vouch
for
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
likely
to
be
as
untainted
,
perhaps
,
as
the
blood
of
many
a
gentleman
:
but
what
a
connexion
have
she
be
prepare
for
Mr.
Knightley
 
or
for
the
churchill
 
or
even
for
Mr.
Elton
!
 
<EOS>
the
stain
of
illegitimacy
,
unbleache
by
nobility
or
wealth
,
would
have
be
a
stain
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
no
objection
be
raise
on
the
father
's
side
;
the
young
man
be
treat
liberally
;
it
be
all
as
it
should
be
:
and
as
Emma
become
acquaint
with
Robert
Martin
,
who
be
now
introduce
at
Hartfield
,
she
fully
acknowledge
in
him
all
the
appearance
of
sense
and
worth
which
could
bid
fair
for
her
little
friend
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
doubt
of
Harriet
's
happiness
with
any
good
-
tempered
man
;
but
with
him
,
and
in
the
home
he
offer
,
there
would
be
the
hope
of
more
,
of
security
,
stability
,
and
improvement
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
place
in
the
midst
of
those
who
love
her
,
and
who
have
well
sense
than
herself
;
retire
enough
for
safety
,
and
occupy
enough
for
cheerfulness
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
never
lead
into
temptation
,
nor
leave
for
it
to
find
her
out
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
respectable
and
happy
;
and
Emma
admit
her
to
be
the
lucky
creature
in
the
world
,
to
have
create
so
steady
and
persevere
an
affection
in
such
a
man
;
 
or
,
if
not
quite
the
lucky
,
to
yield
only
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
,
necessarily
draw
away
by
her
engagement
with
the
Martins
,
be
less
and
less
at
Hartfield
;
which
be
not
to
be
regret
.
 
<EOS>
the
intimacy
between
her
and
Emma
must
sink
;
their
friendship
must
change
into
a
calm
sort
of
goodwill
;
and
,
fortunately
,
what
ought
to
be
,
and
must
be
,
seem
already
begin
,
and
in
the
most
gradual
,
natural
manner
.
  
<EOS>
before
the
end
of
September
,
Emma
attend
Harriet
to
church
,
and
see
her
hand
bestow
on
Robert
Martin
with
so
complete
a
satisfaction
,
as
no
remembrance
,
even
connect
with
Mr.
Elton
as
he
stand
before
them
,
could
impair
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
,
indeed
,
at
that
time
she
scarcely
see
Mr.
Elton
,
but
as
the
clergyman
whose
blessing
at
the
altar
may
next
fall
on
herself
.
 
<EOS>
Robert
Martin
and
Harriet
Smith
,
the
late
couple
engage
of
the
three
,
be
the
first
to
be
marry
.
  
<EOS>
Jane
Fairfax
have
already
quit
Highbury
,
and
be
restore
to
the
comfort
of
her
beloved
home
with
the
Campbells
.
 
<EOS>
the
Mr.
Churchills
be
also
in
town
;
and
they
be
only
wait
for
November
.
  
<EOS>
the
intermediate
month
be
the
one
fix
on
,
as
far
as
they
dare
,
by
Emma
and
Mr.
Knightley
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
determine
that
their
marriage
ought
to
be
conclude
while
John
and
Isabella
be
still
at
Hartfield
,
to
allow
them
the
fortnight
's
absence
in
a
tour
to
the
seaside
,
which
be
the
plan
.
 
<EOS>
John
and
Isabella
,
and
every
other
friend
,
be
agree
in
approve
it
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Woodhouse
 
<EOS>
how
be
Mr.
Woodhouse
to
be
induce
to
consent
?
 
<EOS>
he
,
who
have
never
yet
allude
to
their
marriage
<EOS>
but
as
a
distant
event
.
  
<EOS>
when
first
sound
on
the
subject
,
he
be
so
miserable
,
that
they
be
almost
hopeless
.
 
<EOS>
a
second
allusion
,
indeed
,
give
less
pain
.
 
<EOS>
He
begin
to
think
it
be
to
be
,
and
that
he
could
not
prevent
it
 
a
very
promising
step
of
the
mind
on
its
way
to
resignation
.
<EOS>
still
,
however
,
he
be
not
happy
.
<EOS>
nay
,
he
appear
so
much
otherwise
,
that
his
daughter
's
courage
fail
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
bear
to
see
him
suffer
,
to
know
him
fancy
himself
neglect
;
and
though
her
understanding
almost
acquiesce
in
the
assurance
of
both
the
Mr.
Knightleys
,
that
when
once
the
event
be
over
,
his
distress
would
be
soon
over
too
,
she
hesitate
 
<EOS>
she
could
not
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
state
of
suspense
they
be
befriend
,
not
by
any
sudden
illumination
of
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
mind
,
or
any
wonderful
change
of
his
nervous
system
,
but
by
the
operation
of
the
same
system
in
another
way
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Weston
's
poultry
-
house
be
rob
one
night
of
all
her
turkey
 
evidently
by
the
ingenuity

to
Mr.
Woodhouse
's
fear

<EOS>
He
be
very
uneasy
;
and
<EOS>
but
for
the
sense
of
his
son
-
in
-
law
's
protection
,
would
have
be
under
wretched
alarm
every
night
of
his
life

<EOS>
the
strength

resolution

and
presence
of
mind
of
the
Mr.

command
his
full
dependence
.
<EOS>
while
either
of
them
protect
him
and
his

Hartfield

safe

<EOS>
but
Mr.
John
Knightley
must
be
in
London
again
by
the
end
of
the
first
week
in
November
.
  
<EOS>
the
result
of
this
distress
be
,
that
,
with
a
much
more
voluntary
,
cheerful
consent
than
his
daughter
have
ever
presume
to
hope
for
at
the
moment

she
be
able
to
fix
her
wedding

<EOS>
the
wedding
be
very
much
like
other
wedding
,
where
the
party
have
no
taste
for
finery
or
parade
;
and
Mrs.
Elton
,
from
the
particular
detail
by
her
husband
,
think
it
all
extremely
shabby
,
and
very
inferior
to
her
own

<EOS>
"
very
little
white
satin

very
few

a
most
pitiful
business

in
