<EOS>
how
can
the
ancient
English
Cathedral
tower
be
here
!
 
<EOS>
the
well

know
massive
gray
square
tower
of
its
old
Cathedral
?
 
<EOS>
how
can
that
be
here

<EOS>
there
be
no
spike
of
rusty
iron
in
the
air
,
between
the
eye

from
any
point
of
the

<EOS>
what
be
the
spike
that
intervene
,
and
who
have
set
it
up
?
 
<EOS>
maybe
it
be
set
up
by
the
Sultan
's
order
for
the
impaling
of
a
horde
of
turkish
robber

one

It

in

where
it
can
not
be
,
and
still
no
writhing
figure
be
on
the
grim
spike
.
 
<EOS>
Stay

<EOS>
be
the
spike
so
low
a
thing
as
the
rusty
spike
on
the
top
of
a
post
of
an
old
bedstead
that

tumble

He

"

<EOS>
as
he
watch
the
spasmodic
shoot

dart
that
break
out

like
fitful
lightning
out

a
dark
sky

contagion

insomuch
that
he
have
to
withdraw
himself
to
a
lean
arm

chair

,
for
such
emergency

and
to
sit
in
it
,
hold
tight
,
until
he
have
get
the
well
of
this
unclean
spirit
of
imitation
.
   
<EOS>
then
he
come
back
,
pounce
on
the
Chinaman
,
and
seize
him
with
both
hand
by
the
throat
,
turn
him
violently
on
the
bed

<EOS>
the
Chinaman
clutch
the
aggressive
hand

watchful
pause

"
unintelligible

<EOS>
slowly
loosen
his
grasp
as
he
listen
to
the
incoherent
jargon
with
an
attentive
frown

he
turn
to
the
Lascar

fairly
drag
him
forth
upon
the
floor

as
he
fall
,

Lascar
start
into
a
half

rise
attitude

glare
with
his
eye
,
lash
about
him
fiercely
with
his
arm

and
draw
a
phantom
knife

<EOS>
It
then
become
apparent
that
the
woman
have
take
possession
of
this
knife
,
for
safety

sake

she
too
start
up

drowsily

<EOS>
there
have
be
chatter

enough
between

comment
of
the
watcher

make
with
some
reassured
nodding
of
his
head

gloomy
smile

<EOS>
He
then
lay
certain
silver
money
on
the
table
,
find
his
hat
,
grope
his
way
down
the
broken
stair
,
give
a
good
morning

for
sufficient
reason
,
which
this
narrative
will
itself
unfold
as
it
advance
,
a
fictitious
name
must
be
bestow
upon
the
old
cathedral
town
.
 
<EOS>
let
it
stand
in
these
page
as
Cloisterham
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
once
possibly
know
to
the
Druids
by
another
name
,
and
certainly
to
the
Romans
by
another
,
and
to
the
Saxons
by
another
,
and
to
the
Normans
by
another
;
and
a
name
more
or
less
in
the
course
of
many
century
can
be
of
little
moment
to
its
dusty
chronicle
.
   
<EOS>
an
ancient
city
,
Cloisterham
,
and
<EOS>
no
meet
dwelling
-
place
for
any
one
with
hankering
after
the
noisy
world
.
 
<EOS>
a
monotonous
,
silent
city
,
derive
an
earthy
flavour
throughout
from
its
cathedral
crypt
,
and
so
abound
in
vestige
of
monastic
grave
,
that
the
Cloisterham
child
grow
small
salad
in
the
dust
of
abbot
and
abbess
,
and
make
dirt
-
pie
of
nun
and
friar
;
while
every
ploughman
in
its
outlying
field
render
to
once
puissant
Lord
Treasurers
,
Archbishops
,
Bishops
,
and
such
-
like
,
the
attention
which
the
Ogre
in
the
story
-
book
desire
to
render
to
his
unbidden
visitor
,
and
grind
their
bone
to
make
his
bread
.
   
<EOS>
a
drowsy
city
,
Cloisterham
,
whose
inhabitant
seem
to
suppose
,
with
an
inconsistency
more
strange
than
rare
,
that
all
its
change
lie
behind
it
,
and
that
there
be
no
more
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
a
queer
moral
to
derive
from
antiquity
,
yet
old
than
any
traceable
antiquity
.
 
<EOS>
so
silent
be
the
street
of
Cloisterham
(
though
prone
to
echo
on
the
small
provocation
)
,
that
of
a
summer
-
day
the
sunblind
of
its
shop
scarce
dare
to
flap
in
the
south
wind
;
while
the
sun
-
brown
tramp
,
who
pass
along
and
stare
,
quicken
their
limp
a
little
,
that
they
may
the
sooner
get
beyond
the
confine
of
its
oppressive
respectability
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
feat
not
difficult
of
achievement
,
see
that
the
street
of
Cloisterham
city
be
little
more
than
one
narrow
street
by
which
you
get
into
it
and
get
out
of
it
:
 
the
rest
be
mostly
disappointing
yard
with
pump
in
them
and
no
thoroughfare
---
exception
make
of
the
Cathedral

close

and
a

Quaker
settlement
,
in
colour
and
general
confirmation
very
like

<EOS>
in
a
word
,
a
city
of
another
and
a
bygone
time
be
Cloisterham
,
with
its
hoarse
Cathedral

bell
,
its
hoarse
rook

<EOS>
all

<EOS>
even
its
single
pawnbroker
take
in
no

nor
have
he
for
a
long
time
,
but
offer
vainly
an
unredeemed
stock
for
sale
,
of
which
the
costlier
article
be
dim
and
pale
old

apparently
in
a
slow
perspiration
,
tarnished

<EOS>
the
most
abundant
and
the
most
agreeable
evidence
of
progress
life
in
Cloisterham
be
the
evidence
of
vegetable
life
in

even
its
drooping
and
despondent
little
theatre
have
its
poor
strip

receive
the
foul
fiend

infernal
region

<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
Cloisterham
stand
the
Nuns

House
:
 
a
venerable
brick
edifice
,
whose
present
appellation
be
doubtless

from
the
legend
of
its
conventual
use

<EOS>
on

<EOS>
the

the
general

have
remind
imaginative
stranger
of
a
battered
old
beau
with
a
large
modern
eye

<EOS>
whether
the
nun
of
yore

be

,
habitually
bend
their
contemplative
head
to
avoid
collision
with
the
beam
in
the
low
ceiling

chamber
of

whether
they
sit
in

long
low
window
tell
their

,
instead
of
make
necklace

these
may
be
matter
of
interest
to
its
haunting
ghost
(
if
any
)
,
but
constitute
no
item
in
Miss
Twinkleton
's
half

yearly
account
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
neither
of
Miss
Twinkleton
's
inclusive
regular
,
nor
of
her
extra
.
<EOS>
the

who
undertake

so
much
(
or
so
little
)
<EOS>
a
quarter
have
no
piece
in
her
list
of
recital
bear
on
such
unprofitable
question
.
   
<EOS>
as
,
in
some
case
of
drunkenness
,
and
in
other
of
animal
magnetism
,
there
be
two
state
of
consciousness
which
never
clash
,
but
each
of
which
pursue
its
separate
course
as
though
it
be
continuous
instead
of
break
(
thus
,
if
I
hide
my
watch
when
I
be
drunk
,
I
must
be
drunk
again
before
I
can
remember
where
)
,
so
Miss
Twinkleton
have
two
distinct
and
separate
phase
of
be
.
 
<EOS>
every
night
,
the
moment
the
young
lady
have
retire
to
rest
,
do
Miss
Twinkleton
smarten
up
her
curl
a
little
,
brighten
up
her
eye
a
little
,
and
become
a
sprightlier
Miss
Twinkleton
than
the
young
lady
have
ever
see
.
 
<EOS>
every
night
,
at
the
same
hour
,
do
Miss
Twinkleton
resume
the
topic
of
the
previous
night
,
comprehend
the
tenderer
scandal
of
Cloisterham
,
of
which
she
have
no
knowledge
<EOS>
whatever
by
day
,
and
reference
to
a
certain
season
at
Tunbridge
Wells
(
airily
call
by
Miss
Twinkleton
in
this
state
of
her
existence
"
the
Wells
"
)
,
notably
the
season
wherein
a
certain
finish
gentleman
(
compassionately
call
by
Miss
Twinkleton
,
in
this
stage
of
her
existence
,
"
foolish
Mr
Porters
"
)
reveal
a
homage
of
the
heart
,
whereof
Miss
Twinkleton
,
in
her
scholastic
state
of
existence
,
be
as
ignorant
as
a
granite
pillar
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Twinkleton
's
companion
in
both
state
of
existence
,
and
equally
adaptable
to
either
,
be
one
<EOS>
Mrs
Tisher
:
 
a
deferential
widow
with
a
weak
back
,
a
chronic
sigh
,
and
a
suppress
voice
,
who
look
after
the
young
lady
'
wardrobe
,
and
lead
them
to
infer
that
she
have
see
well
day
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
this
be
the
reason
why
it
be
an
article
of
faith
with
the
servant
,
hand
down
from
race
to
race

that
the
depart
Tisher
be
a

<EOS>
the

Miss
Rosa
Bud
,
of
course
call
Rosebud
;
wonderfully
pretty
,
wonderfully
childish
,
wonderfully
whimsical

<EOS>
an
awkward
interest
(
awkward
because
romantic
)
attach
to
Miss
Bud
in
the
mind
of
the
young
lady

on
account
of
its

and
bequest

and
that

<EOS>
Miss
Twinkleton

seminarial
state
of

have
combat
the
romantic
aspect
of
this
destiny
by
affect
to
shake
her
head
over
it
behind
Miss
Bud

dimpled
shoulder

and
to
brood
on
the
unhappy
lot
of
that
doom
little
victim

<EOS>
but
with
no
well

possibly
some
unfelt
touch

foolish
Mr

undermine
the
endeavour

to
evoke
from
the
young

an
unanimous

<EOS>
the

that

with
great
enjoyment

Edwin
scarcely
seem
to
see
the
force
of
this
;
beg
to
know
if
he
may
take
the
liberty
to
ask
why
?
   
<EOS>
"
because
I
be
so
tired
of
you

return
Rosa
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
quickly
add
,
and
pleadingly
too
,
see
displeasure
in
his
face
:
 
<EOS>
"
dear
Eddy
,
you
be
just
as
tired
of
me
,
you
know

<EOS>
"
do
I
say
so
,
Rosa

<EOS>
"
say
so

only
show
it
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
she
do
it
so
well
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Rosa
,
in
a
sudden
ecstasy
with
her
counterfeit
betroth
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
strike
me
that
she
must
be
a
devilish
impudent
girl
,
"
say
Edwin
Drood
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
,
Pussy
,
you
have
pass
your
last
birthday
in
this
old
house
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
yes
!
"
<EOS>
Rosa
clasp
her
hand
,
look
down
with
a
sigh
,
and
shake
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
be
sorry
,
Rosa
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
for
the
poor
old
place
.
 
<EOS>
somehow
,
I
feel
as
if
it
would
miss
me
,
when
I
be
go
so
far
away
,
so
young
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
perhaps
we
have
better
stop
short
,
Rosa
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
look
up
at
him
with
a
swift
bright
look
;
next
moment
shake
her
head
,
sigh
,
and
look
down
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
to
say
,
be
it
,
Pussy
,
that
we
be
both
resign
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
nod
her
head
again
,
and
after
a
short
silence
,
quaintly
burst
out
with
:
 
"
You
know
we
must
be
married
,
and
marry
from
here
,
Eddy
,
or
the
poor
girl
will
be
so
dreadfully
disappointed
!
"
   
<EOS>
for
the
moment
there
be
more
of
compassion
,
both
for
her
and
for
himself
,
in
her
affianced
husband
's
face
,
than
there
be
of
love

<EOS>
He
check
the
look
,
and
ask
:
 
"
Shall
I
take
you
out
for
a
walk
,
Rosa
dear
?
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
dear
do
not
seem
at
all
clear
on
this
point
,
until
her
face
,
which
have
be
comically
reflective
,
brighten
.
 
<EOS>
"
o
,
yes
,
Eddy
;
let
us
go
for
a
walk

I
tell
you

we
will
do

You
shall
pretend

fortuitous
concourse

accident

matronly
Tisher

in

,
in
rustle
through
the
room

legendary
ghost

dowager

silken
skirt

then
I
know
what
would

for

be
at
once

soon

young
couple
go
out

the
Nuns

House

take
all
precaution
against
the
discovery
of
the
so
vitally
defective
boot

precaution

something
untamed

slender

supple

quick

half
defiant

pause

whole
expression

Mr

without

monopolise
the

Mr

incredulity

his

express
such
absolute

to
anybody

as
if
to
notice
it

be
almost
tantamount
to
notice
a
passage
in
a

It
be
a
consequence
of
his

the
accompaniment
without
note
,
and
of
her
be
a
heedless
little
creature

very
apt
to
go
wrong
,
that
he
follow
her
lip
most
attentively

with
his

as
well

carefully

stand
with
an

round
her

more

Edwin

sort
of

as

watch
the

"
   
<EOS>
now
,
there
be
these
two
curious
touch
of
human
nature
work
the
secret
spring
of
this
dialogue
.
 
<EOS>
Neville
Landless
be
already
enough
impress
by
Little
Rosebud
,
to
feel
indignant
that
Edwin
Drood
(
far
below
her
)
should
hold
his
prize
so
lightly
.
 
<EOS>
Edwin
Drood
be
already
enough
impress
by
Helena
,
to
feel
indignant
that
Helena
's
brother
(
far
below
her
)
should
dispose
of
him
so
coolly
,
and
put
him
out
of
the
way
so
entirely
.
   
<EOS>
however
,
the
last
remark
have
better
be
answer
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
say
Edwin
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
Mr
Neville
"
<EOS>
(
adopt
that
mode
of
address
from
Mr
Crisparkle
)
,
"
that
what
people
be
proud
of
,
they
usually
talk
most
about
;
I
do
not
know
either
,
that
what
they
be
proud
of
,
they
most
like
other
people
to
talk
about
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
live
a
busy
life
,
and
I
speak
under
correction
by
you
reader
,
who
ought
to
know
everything
,
and
I
daresay
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
by
this
time
they
have
both
become
savage
;
Mr
Neville
out
in
the
open
;
Edwin
Drood
under
the
transparent
cover
of
a
popular
tune
,
and
a
stop
now
and
then
to
pretend
to
admire
picturesque
effect
in
the
moonlight
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
do
not
seem
to
me
very
civil
in
you
,
"
remark
Neville
,
at
length
,
"
to
reflect
upon
a
stranger
who
come
here
,
not
have
have
your
advantage
,
to
try
to
make
up
for
lose
time
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
to
be
sure
,
I
be
not
bring
up
in
"
busy
life
,
"
and
my
idea
of
civility
be
form
among
heathen
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
the
good
civility
,
whatever
kind
of
people
we
be
bring
up
among
,
"
retort
Edwin
Drood
,
"
be
to
mind
our
own
business
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
will
set
me
that
example
,
I
promise
to
follow
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
that
you
take
a
great
deal
too
much
upon
yourself
?
"
be
the
angry
rejoinder
,
"
and
that
in
the
part
of
the
world
I
come
from
,
you
would
be
call
to
account
for
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
by
whom
,
for
instance
?
"
ask
Edwin
Drood
,
come
to
a
halt
,
and
survey
the
other
with
a
look
of
disdain
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
here
a
startling
right
hand
be
lay
on
Edwin
's
shoulder
,
and
Jasper
stand
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
it
would
seem
that
he
,
too
,
have
stroll
round
by
the
Nuns
'
House
,
and
have
come
up
behind
them
on
the
shadowy
side
of
the
road
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ned
,
Ned
,
Ned
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
;
"
we
must
have
no
more
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
overhear
high
word
between
you
two
.
 
<EOS>
remember
,
my
dear
boy
,
you
be
almost
in
the
position
of
host
to

night

<EOS>
You
belong
,
as
it
be
,
to
the
place
,
and
in
a
manner
represent
it
towards
a
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Neville
be
a
stranger
,
and
you
should
respect
the
obligation
of
hospitality
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
Mr
Neville
,
"
lay
his
left
hand
on
the
inner
shoulder
of
that
young
gentleman
,
and
thus
walk
on
between
them
<EOS>
,
hand
to
shoulder
on
either
side
:
"
you
will
pardon
me
;
but
I
appeal
to
you
to
govern
your
temper
too

<EOS>
now
,
what
be
amiss
?
 
<EOS>
but
why
ask
!
 
<EOS>
let
there
be
nothing
amiss
,
and
the
question
be
superfluous
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
all
three
on
a
good
understanding

be
we
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
after
a
silent
struggle
between
the
two
young
man
who
shall
speak
last
,
Edwin
Drood
strike
in
with
:
 
"
so
far

Neville
Landless
,
though
not
so
freely
;

perhaps
so
carelessly

but
if
Mr

know
all

lie
behind

far
away
from

may
know
better
how

sharp
edge

in

soothing
manner

not

all
over

feel
it
impossible
to
say
less

would
rather
not
go

<EOS>
He
have
an
impression
upon
him
that
he
have
lose
hold
of
his
temper
;
feel
that
Edwin
Drood
's
coolness
,
so
far
from

infectious

make
him
red

hot

<EOS>
Mr
Jasper

still
walk
in
the
centre
,
hand
to
shoulder
on
either
side
,
beautifully
turn
the
Refrain
of
a
drinking
song

they
all
go
up

there

visible

the
understanding

two
young
man

as
rather
awkwardly
revive
the
subject
of
their
difference

accordingly

they
both
glance
at
it
consciously

say
nothing

Jasper

however

who
would
appear
from
his
conduct
to
have
gain

an
imperfect
clue
to

this
insulting
allusion

violent
degree

fling

dreg

act

a
rush

Neville
throw
him
off

pause
for
an
instant

in
a
rage
passion

with
the
goblet
yet
in
his
uplifted
hand

<EOS>
then
,
he
dash
it
down
under
the
grate
,
with
such
force
that
the
broken
splinter
fly
out
again
in
a
shower
;

he
leave
the
house

<EOS>
when
he
first
emerge
into
the
night
air

nothing
around
him
be
still

steady

nothing
around
him
show
like
what
it

he
only
know
that
he
stand
with
a
bare
head
in
the

of
a
blood

red
whirl

wait
to
be
struggle

to
struggle
to
the
death

nothing

the
moon
look
down
upon
him

be
dead

fit
of
wrath

hold
his
steam

hammer
beating
head

away

then
,
he
become
half
-
conscious
of
have
hear
himself
bolt

bar
out
,
like
a
dangerous
animal
;
and
think
what
shall
he
do
?
   
<EOS>
some
wildly
passionate
idea
of
the
river
dissolve
under
the
spell
of
the
moonlight
on
the
Cathedral
and
the
grave
,
and
the
remembrance
of
his
sister
,

the
thought
of
what
he
owe

the
good
man

that
very
day
win
his
confidence

him
his

Minor
Canon
Corner

softly
at

door

<EOS>
It
be
Mr

's
custom
to
sit
up
last
of
the
early
household
,
very
softly
touch
his
piano
and
practise
his
favourite
part
in
concerted
vocal
music

the
south
wind

not
more
subdued
than
Mr
Crisparkle
at
such
time

regardful
of
the
slumber
of

china
shepherdess

His
knock

immediately
answer

up

this

a
lame
departure

outside

Nine

Mr

smooth
his

again

death
be

"
 
a
sudden
recollection
of
the
death
of
her
two
parent
seem
to
stop
him
,
and
he
say
in
a
soft
tone

evidently
insert
the
negative
as
an
after

thought

"
death

His

grind
it
straight

into
high

dry
snuff

yet
,
through
the
very
limited

of

he
seem
to
express
kindness

if
Nature
have

finish
him
off

kindness
may
have
be
recognisable
in
his
face
at
this
moment

but
if
the
notch
in
his

would
not
fuse
together

laugh
at
the
idea

be
in

It
seem
,
to
her
inexperience

a
comical
vagary
of
the
imagination

Mr

stretch
his
near
sight
to
be
sure

this
be
her
view

"

say

as

with

"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
feel
what
his
next
memorandum
would
prove
to
be
,
and
be
blush
and
fold
a
crease
in

dress

one
embarrassed

long
before

find

<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
carry
his
smooth
hand
down
over
his
eye
and
nose
,
and
even
chin
,
before
draw
his
chair
a
little
nearer
,
and
speak
a
little
more
confidentially
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
now
touch
,

upon
the
point

present
visit

<EOS>
Othenwise
,
be
a
particularly
angular
man

,
I
should
not
have
intrude
here

<EOS>
I
be
the
last
man
to
intrude
into
a
sphere
for
which
I
be
so
entirely
unfitted
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
,
on
these
premise
,
as
if
I
be
a
bear

with
the
cramp

in

youthful
Cotillon

<EOS>
His
ungainliness
give
him
enough
of
the
air
of
his
simile

set
Rosa
off

heartily

<EOS>
"

Mr

just

at

Your
relation

relation

residue
of

for

the

he

know

He

It
have
be
often
enough
remark
that
woman
have
a
curious
power
of
divine
the
character
of
man
,
which
would
seem
to
be
innate
and
instinctive
;
see
that
it
be
arrive
at
through
no
patient
process
of
reasoning
,
that
it
can
give
no
satisfactory
or
sufficient
account
of
itself
,
and
that
it
pronounce
in
the
most
confident
manner
even
against
accumulate
observation
on
the
part
of
the
other
sex
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
have
not
be
quite
so
often
remark
that
this
power
(
fallible
,
like
every
other
human
attribute
)
be
for
the
most
part
absolutely
incapable
of
self
-
revision
;
and
that
when
it
have
deliver
an
adverse
opinion
which
by
all
human
light
be
subsequently
prove
to
have
fail
,
it
be
undistinguishable
from
prejudice
,
in
respect
of
its
determination
not
to
be
correct
.
<EOS>
nay
,
the
very
possibility
of
contradiction

disproof
,
however
remote

communicate
to
this
feminine
judgment
from
the
first
,
in
nine
case
out
of

,
the
weakness
attendant
on
the
testimony
of
an
interested

so
personally

strongly
do
the

diviner

herself
with

"
   
<EOS>
at
these
word
Mr
Crisparkle
fall
into
a
little
reverie
,
in
which
he
think
of
several
thing
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
of
the
time
he
have
see
the
brother
and
sister
together
in
deep
converse
over
one
of
his
own
old
college
book
;
now
,
in
the
rimy
morning
,
when
he
make
those
sharpen
pilgrimage
to
Cloisterham
Weir
;
now
,
in
the
sombre
evening
,
when
he
face
the
wind
at
sunset
,
have
climb
his
favourite
outlook
,
a
beetling
fragment
of
monastery
ruin
;
and
the
two
studious
figure
pass
below
him
along
the
margin
of
the
river
,
in
which
the
town
fire
and
light
already
shine
,
make
the
landscape
bleaker
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
how
the
consciousness
have
steal
upon
him
that
in
teach
one
,
he
be
teach
two
;
and
how
he
have
almost
insensibly
adapt
his
explanation
to
both
mind
---
that
with
which
his
own
be
daily
in
contact
,
and
that
which
he
only
approach
through
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
of
the
gossip
that
have
reach
him
from
the
Nuns
'
House
,
to
the
effect
that
Helena
,
whom
he
have
mistrust
as
so
proud
and
fierce
,
submit
herself
to
the
fairy
-
bride
(
as
he
call
her
)
,
and
learn
from
her
what
she
know
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
of
the
picturesque
alliance
between
those
two
,
externally
so
very
different
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
---
perhaps
most
of
all
---
could
it
be
that
these
thing
be
yet

so
many
week
old

very
cold

he
set
off
for
a
brisk
trot
after
service
;
the
trot
to
end
in
a
charge
at
his
favourite
fragment
of
ruin
,
which

by
storm

without

for

down
upon
the

<EOS>
the
river
at
Cloisterham
be
sufficiently
near
the
sea
to
throw
up

a
quantity
of
seaweed

<EOS>
an
unusual
quantity

come
in

this

the
confusion
of

angry
light

seaward
beyond
the
brown

barge
that

a
stormy
night

<EOS>
in
his
mind
he
be
contrast
the
wild
and
noisy
sea
with
the
quiet
harbour
of
Minor
Canon
Corner
,
when
Helena
and
Neville
Landless

below
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
have
the
two
together
in
his
thought
all
day

at

climb
down
to
speak
to
them
together

<EOS>
the
footing
be
rough
in
an
uncertain
light
for
any

that
of

good
climber

the
Minor
Canon
be

good
a
climber
as
most
man

stand
beside
them
before
many
good
climber
would
have

half

way
down

<EOS>
"
a
wild
evening

Miss
Landless

<EOS>
do
you
not
find
your

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
It

It

assent
Mr

lay
hold
of

on
with
them

<EOS>
"
It

<EOS>
in
say
it
he
look

yes

<EOS>

unfortunate

resume
Mr

,
"
forasmuch
as
it
certainly

engender
a
prejudice

<EOS>
there
be
a
notion
about

he

I

now

Mr

again
resume

in
a

of
mild

firm
persuasion

be
not
this
to

regret

ought

<EOS>
these
be
early
day
of
Neville

in
Cloisterham
,

I
have
no

of
his
outliving
such
a
prejudice
,

prove
himself
to
have
be
misunderstood

<EOS>
but
how
much
wise
to
take
action
at

,
than
to
trust
to
uncertain
time

<EOS>
besides
,
apart
from
its

politic

it

They
walk
on
in
silence
,
until
Helena
raise
her
eye
to
the
Minor
Canon
's
face
,

say
,
almost
reproachfully
:
 
"

O
Mr

would
you

at
Mr

,
who
malign
him
every

in

<EOS>
"
I

represent

forget

in

help

clear
myself

the
plain

,
I
be
still

that
night

I

that
night

<EOS>
"
Neville

hint
the
Minor

with
a
steady
countenance
,

"

Mr

gravely
;

therefore
your

if
it

Mr

Mr

I
be
sorely

trace
of

sullen

angry

wild

as
the
night

serious
an
aspect

the
resource

disclose

as

serious
consideration

<EOS>
I
give
it
very
serious
consideration

and
I
speak
to
you
accordingly

this
feud
between
you

Drood
must
not
go

<EOS>
I
can
not

go
on

I

unauthorised
construction
your

envious
wrath
may
put

good

natured
character

<EOS>
I
know
I
can
trust
to
it
for
that

<EOS>
now
,
pray
observe
what
I
be
about
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
on
reflection

on
your

representation

I
be
willing

admit
that

peace
with
young

you
have
a

half

way

I
will
engage

you
shall
be

and
even
that
young

shall
make
the
first
advance

<EOS>
this
condition

you
will
pledge
me
the

what
may
be

when
you
give

be

Searcher

it
will
never

<EOS>
so

that
;
next
as

speak
of

your
infatuation

consciousness

denote

<EOS>
after
what
I
have
just
now

I
have
a
morbid
dread
upon

some
horrible
consequence
result

that
I
can
not
reason
with

in

against

all
my
effort

vain

<EOS>
the
demoniacal
passion
of
this
Neville
Landless
,
his
strength
in
his
fury
,
and
his
savage
rage
for
the
destruction
of
its
object
,
appal
me
.
 
<EOS>
so
profound
be
the
impression
,
that
twice
since
I
have
go
into
my
dear
boy
's
room

to
assure
myself
of
his
sleep
safely
,

not
lie
dead
in
his
blood

here
be
another
entry
next
morning

"
<EOS>
"
Ned
up
and
away
.
 
<EOS>
light
-
hearted
and
unsuspicious
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
He
laugh
when
I
caution
him
,
and
say
he
be
as
good
a
man
as
Neville
Landless
any
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
that
may
be
,
but
he
be
not
as
bad
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
continue
to
make
light
of
it
,
but
I
travel
with
him
as
far
as
I
could
,
and
leave
him
most
unwillingly
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
unable
to
shake
off
these
dark
intangible
presentiment
of
evil

feeling
found
upon

to
be

in
conclusion

twirl
the
leave
of
the
book
before
put
it
by
,
"
I
have
relapse
into
these
mood
,
as
other
entry
show

<EOS>

I
have
now
your
assurance
at
my
back

shall
put
it
in
my
book

make
it
an
antidote

my
black
humour

<EOS>
"
such
an
antidote

I
hope

return
Mr

as
will
induce
you
before
long
to
consign
the
black
humour
to
the
flame

I
ought
to
be
the
last
to
find
any
fault
with
you
this
evening
,
when
you
have
meet
my
wish
so
freely

I
must
say
,
Jasper

that
your
devotion

make
you
exaggerative

Mr

it
give
you
a
bright
and

Mr

I

will
throw
in

<EOS>
I
dare
say
it
be
wrong
in
many
particular

want
many
touch

I

neither

well
!
 
<EOS>
I
hazard
the
guess
that
the
true
lover
's
mind
be
completely
permeate
by
the
beloved
object
of
his
affection

<EOS>
I
hazard
the
guess
that
her
dear
name
be
precious
to
him
,
can
not
be
hear
or
repeat
without
emotion
,
and
be
preserve
sacred

<EOS>
if
he
have
any
distinguish
appellation
of
fondness
for
her
,
it
be
reserve
for
her

be
not
for
common
ear
.
 
<EOS>
a
name
that
it
would
be
a
privilege
to
call
her
by
,
be
alone
with
her
own
bright
self
<EOS>
,
it
would
be
a
liberty
,
a
coldness
,
an
insensibility

almost
a
breach
of
good
faith

to
flaunt
elsewhere

"
   
<EOS>
It
be
wonderful
to
see
Mr
Grewgious
sit
bolt
upright
,
with
his
hand
on
his
knee
,
continuously
chop
this
discourse
out
of
himself
:
 
much
as
a
charity
boy
with
a
very
good
memory
may
get
his
catechism
say
:
 
and
evince
no
correspondent
emotion
<EOS>
whatever

in
a
certain
occasional
little
tingling
perceptible
at
the
end

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
picture
,
"
Mr
Grewgious
proceed
,
"
go
on
to
represent
(
under
correction
from

Mr

,
the
true
lover
as
ever
impatient
to
be
in
the
presence
or
vicinity
of
the
beloved
object
of
his
affection
;
as
care
very
little
for
his
case
in
any
other
society
;
and
as
constantly
seek
that
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
be
to
say
seek
that
,
as
a
bird
seek
its
nest
,
I
should
make
an
ass
of
myself
,
because
that
would
trench
upon
what
I
understand
to
be
poetry
;
and
I
be
so
far
from
trench
upon
poetry
at
any
time
,
that
I
never
,
to
my
knowledge
,
get
within
ten
thousand
mile
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
besides
totally
unacquainted
with
the
habit
of
bird
,
except
the
bird
of
Staple
Inn
,
who
seek
their
nest
on
ledge
,
and
in
gutter
-
pipe
and
chimneypot
,
not
construct
for
them
by
the
beneficent
hand
of
Nature

<EOS>
I
beg
,
therefore
,
to
be
understand
as
forego
the
bird's
-
nest
.
 
<EOS>

my
picture
do
represent
the
true
lover
as
have
no
existence
separable
from
that
of
the
beloved
object
of
his
affection
,
and
as
live
at
once
a
double
life
and
a
halve
life
.
 
<EOS>
and
if
I
do
not
clearly
express
what
I
mean
by
that
,
it
be
either
for
the
reason
that
have
no
conversational
power
,
I
can
not
express
what
I
mean

or
that
have
no
meaning

I
do

be
something
dreamy

should

be
need

they
go
out
together

all

surely
an

that
Durdles

that
he
should

steal
forth
to
climb

dive

and
wander
without

be
nothing
extraordinary

but
that
the
Choir

Master
or
any
one
else
should
hold
it
worth
his
while
to
be
with
him
,
and
to
study
moonlight
effect
in
such
company
be
another
affair
.
 
<EOS>
surely
an
unaccountable
sort
of
expedition
,
therefore
!

They
go
on

presently
pass
the
red

of
the
Travellers

emerge
into
the
clear
moonlight
of
the
Monks

Vineyard

<EOS>
this
cross
<EOS>
,
they
come
to
Minor
Canon
Corner
:
 
of
which
the
great
part
lie
in
shadow
until
the

shall
rise
higher
in

<EOS>
the
sound
of
a
close
house

door
strike
their
ear
,
and
two
man
come
out
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
Mr

Neville

<EOS>
Jasper
,
with
a
strange
and
sudden
smile
upon
his
face
,
lay
the
palm
of
his
hand
upon
the
breast
of
Durdles
,
stop
him
where
he
stand

<EOS>
at
that
end
of
Minor
Canon
Corner
the
shadow
be
profound
in
the
exist
state
of

at
that
end

too

there
be
a
piece
of
old

wall
,
breast
high
,
the
only
remain
boundary
of
what
be
once
a
garden
,
but
be
now
the
thoroughfare
.
 
<EOS>
Jasper
and
Durdles
would
have
turn
this
wall
in
another
instant
;
but
,
stop
so
short
,
stand
behind
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
those

whisper
;
"
they
will
go
out
into

they

,
or
want
to
join
us
,
or
what
not

"
   
<EOS>
Durdles
nod
assent
,
and
fall
to
munch
some
fragment
from
his
bundle
.
 
<EOS>
jasper
fold
his
arm
upon
the
top
of
the
wall
,
and
,
with
his
chin
rest
on
them
,
watch
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
no
note
whatever
of
the
Minor
Canon
,
but
watch
Neville
,
as
though
his
eye
be
at
the
trigger
of
a
loaded
rifle
,
and
he
have
cover
him
,
and
be
go
to
fire
.
 
<EOS>
a
sense
of
destructive
power
be
so
express
in
his
face
,
that
even
Durdles
pause
in
his
munching
,
and
look
at
him
,
with
an
unmunched
something
in
his
cheek
.
   
<EOS>
meanwhile
Mr
Crisparkle
and
Neville
walk
to
and
fro
,
quietly
talk
together
.
 
<EOS>
what
they
say
,
can
not
be
hear
consecutively
;
but
Mr
Jasper
have
already
distinguish
his
own
name
more
than
once
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
be
the
first
day
of
the
week
,
"
Mr
Crisparkle
can
be
distinctly
hear
to
observe
,
as
they
turn
back
;
"
and
the
last
day
of
the
week
be
Christmas
Eve
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
certain
of
me
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
echo
be
favourable
at
those
point
,
but
as
the
two
approach
,
the
sound
of
their
talking
become
confused
again
.
 
<EOS>
the
word
"
confidence
,
"
shatter
by
the
echo
,
but
still
capable
of
be
piece
together
,
be
utter
by
Mr
Crisparkle
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
draw
still
nearer
,
this
fragment
of
a
reply
be
hear
:
 
"
not
deserve
yet
,
but
shall
be
,
sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
they
turn
away
again
,
Jasper
again
hear
his
own
name
,
in
connection
with
the
word
from
Mr
Crisparkle
:
 
<EOS>
"
remember
that
I
say
I
answer
for
you
confidently
.
"
<EOS>
then
the
sound
of
their
talk
become
confused
again
;
they
halt
for
a
little
while
,
and
some
earnest
action
on
the
part
of
Neville
succeed
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
move
once
more
,
Mr
Crisparkle
be
see
to
look
up
at
the
sky
,
and
to
point
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
then
slowly
disappear
;
pass
out
into
the
moonlight
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
Corner
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
they
be
go
,
that
Mr
Jasper
move
.
 
<EOS>
but
then
he
turn
to
Durdles
,
and
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
.
 
<EOS>
Durdles
,
who
still
have
that
suspend
something
in
his
cheek
,
and
who
see
nothing
to
laugh
at
,
stare
at
him
until
Mr
Jasper
lay
his
face
down
on
his
arm
to
have
his
laugh
out
.
 
<EOS>
then
Durdles
bolt
the
something
,
as
if
desperately
resign
himself
to
indigestion
.
   
<EOS>
among
those
seclude
nook
there
be
very
little
stir
or
movement
after
dark
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
little
enough
in
the
high
tide
of
the
day
,
but
there
be
next
to
none
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
besides
that
the
cheerfully
frequent
High
Street
lie
nearly
parallel
to
the
spot
(
the
old
Cathedral
rise
between
the
two
)
,
and
be
the
natural
channel
in
which
the
Cloisterham
traffic
flow
,
a
certain
awful
hush
pervade
the
ancient
pile
,
the
cloister
,
and
the
churchyard
,
after
dark
,
which
not
many
people
care
to
encounter
.
 
<EOS>
ask
the
first
hundred
citizen
of
Cloisterham
,
meet
at
random
in
the
street
at
noon
,
if
they
believe
in
Ghosts
,
they
would
tell
you
no
;
but
put
them
to
choose
at
night
between
these
eerie
precinct
and
the
thoroughfare
of
shop
,
and
you
would
find
that
ninety
-
nine
declare
for
the
long
round
and
the
more
frequented
way
.
 
<EOS>
the
cause
of
this
be
not
to
be
find
in
any
local
superstition
that
attach
to
the
Precincts
---
<EOS>
albeit
a
mysterious
lady
,
with
a
child
in
her
arm
and
a
rope
dangle
from
her
neck
,
have
be
see
flit
about
there
by
sundry
witness
as
intangible
as
herself
---
but
it
be
to
be
seek
in
the
innate

from

out

breath
of

also
,
in
the
widely
diffuse

and
almost
as
widely
unacknowledged
,
reflection
:
 
"
<EOS>
if
the
dead
do
,
under
any
circumstance
,
become
visible
to
the
living
,
these
be
such
likely
surrounding

the
purpose
that
I
,
the
living
,
will
get
out
of
them
as
soon
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
hence
,
when
Mr
Jasper
and
Durdles
pause
to
glance
around
them
,
before
descend
into
the
crypt
by
a
small
side
door
,
of
which
the
latter
have
a
key
,
the
whole
expanse
of
moonlight
in
their
view
be
utterly
desert
.
 
<EOS>
one
may
fancy
that
the
tide
of
life
be
stem
by
Mr
Jasper
's
own
gatehouse
.
 
<EOS>
the
murmur
of
the
tide
be
hear
beyond
;
but
no
wave
pass
the
archway
,
over
which
his
lamp
burn
red
behind
his
curtain
,
as
if
the
building
be
a
Lighthouse
.
   
<EOS>
They
enter
,
lock
themselves
in
,
descend
the
rugged
step
,
and
be
down
in
the
Crypt
.
 
<EOS>
the
lantern
be
not
want
,
for
the
moonlight
strike
in
at
the
groin
window
,
bare
of
glass
,
the
broken
frame
for
which
cast
pattern
on
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
the
heavy
pillar
which
support
the
roof
engender
masse
of
black
shade
,
but
between
them
there
be
lane
of
light
.
 
<EOS>
up
and
down
these
lane
they
walk
,
Durdles
discourse
of
the
"
old
un
"
he
yet
count
on
disinterring
,
and
slap
a
wall
,
in
which
he
consider
"
a
whole
family
on
'em
"
to
be
stone
and
earth
up
,
just
as
if
he
be
a
familiar
friend
of
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
the
taciturnity
of
Durdles
be
for
the
time
overcome
by
Mr
Jasper
's
wicker
bottle
,
which
circulate
freely
;
---
in
the
sense
,
that
be
to
say
,
that
its
content
enter
freely
into
Mr
Durdles
's
circulation
,
while
Mr
Jasper
only
rinse
his
mouth
once
,
and
cast
forth
the
rinsing
.
   
<EOS>
They
be
to
ascend
the
great
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
step
by
which
they
rise
to
the
Cathedral
,
Durdles
pause
for
new
store
of
breath
.
 
<EOS>
the
step
be
very
dark
,
but
out
of
the
darkness
they
can
see
the
lane
of
light
they
have
traverse
.
 
<EOS>
Durdles
seat
himself
upon
a
step
.
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
seat
himself
upon
another
.
 
<EOS>
the
odour
from
the
wicker
bottle
(
which
have
somehow
pass
into
Durdles
's
keeping
)
soon
intimate
that
the
cork
have
be
take
out
;
but
this
be
not
ascertainable
through
the
sense
of
sight
,
since
neither
can
descry
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
,
in
talk
,
they
turn
to
one
another
,
as
though
their
face
could
commune
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
this
be
good

It

<EOS>
"
well
,
it
WOULD
lead
towards
a
mixing
of
thing

"
Durdles
acquiesce
:
 
pause
on
the
remark
,
as
if
the
idea
of
ghost
have
not
previously
present
itself
to
him
in
a
merely
inconvenient
light
,
domestically
or
chronologically
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
do
you

may
be
ghost
of
other

not

man

now
I

tell
you

Mr

<EOS>
wait
a
bit
till
I
put
the

right

here
the

<EOS>
now
it

this

in
the

of
give
it
the

at
length
I
give

here
I
fall
asleep

and
what
wake
me

<EOS>
the
ghost
of
a
cry

<EOS>
the
ghost
of
one
terrific
shriek
,
which
shriek
be
follow
by
the
ghost
of
the
howl
of
a
dog
:
 
a
long
,
dismal
,
woeful
howl
,
such
as
a
dog
give
when
a

's
dead

that
be
my
last
Christmas
Eve

<EOS>
"
what
do
you

<EOS>
"
be
the
very
abrupt
,
and
,
one
may
say
,
fierce
retort
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
I
make
inquiry
everywhere
about

that
no

mine

howl

so
I

they

I

never

I

you
be

Jasper

scornfully

so
I

myself

answer
durdle
with

composure

I
be
pick
out
for
it

"
   
<EOS>
Jasper
have
rise
suddenly
,
when
he
ask
him
what
he
mean
,
and
he
now
say
,
"
come
;
we
shall
freeze
here

lead
the
way

<EOS>
Durdles
complie
,
not
over
-
steadily
;
open
the
door
at
the
top
of
the
step
with
the
key
he
have
already
use
;
and
so
emerge
on
the
cathedral
level
,
in
a
passage
at
the
side
of
the
chancel
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
the
moonlight
be
so
very
bright
again
that
the
colour
of
the
near
stain

glass
window
be
throw
upon
their
face
.
 
<EOS>
the
appearance
of
the
unconscious
Durdles
,
hold
the
door
open
for
his
companion
to
follow
,
as
if
from
the
grave
,
be
ghastly
enough
,
with
a
purple
hand
across
his
face
,
and
a
yellow
splash
upon
his
brow
;
but
he
bear
the
close
scrutiny
of
his
companion
in
an
insensible
way
,
although
it
be
prolong
while
the
latter
fumble
among
his
pocket
for
a
key
confide
to
him
that
will
open
an
iron
gate
,
so
to
enable
them
to
pass
to
the
staircase
of
the
great
tower
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
and
the
bottle
be
enough
for
you
to
carry

"
he
say
,
give
it
to
Durdles
;
"
hand
your
bundle
to
me
;
I
be
young
and
longer

winded
than
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Durdles
hesitate
for
a
moment
between
bundle
and
bottle
;
but
give
the
preference
to
the
bottle
as
be
by
far
the
well
company
,
and
consign
the
dry
weight
to
his
fellow
-
explorer
.
   
<EOS>
then
they
go
up
the
winding
staircase
of
the
great
tower
,
toilsomely
,
turn
and
turn
,
and
lower
their
head
to
avoid
the
stair
above
,
or
the
rough
stone
pivot
around
which
they
twist
.
<EOS>
Durdles
have
light
his
lantern
,
by
draw
from
the
cold
,
hard
wall
a
spark
of
that
mysterious
fire
which
lurk
in
everything
,
and
,
guide
by
this
speck
,
they
clamber
up
among
the
cobwebs
and
the
dust
.
 
<EOS>
Their
way
lie
through
strange
place
.
 
<EOS>
twice
or
thrice
<EOS>
they
emerge
into
level
,
low
-
arched
gallery
,
whence
they
can
look
down
into
the
moon
-
light
nave
;
and
where
Durdles
,
wave
his
lantern
,
wave
the
dim
angel
'
head
upon
the
corbel
of
the
roof
,
seem
to
watch
their
progress
.
 
<EOS>
Anon
they
turn
into
narrower
and
steep
staircase
,
and
the
night
-
air
begin
to
blow
upon
them
,
and
the
chirp
of
some
startled
jackdaw
or
frightened
rook
precede
the
heavy
beating
of
wing
in
a
confine
space
,
and
the
beating
down
of
dust
and
straw
upon
their
head
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
leave
their
light
behind
a
stair
---
for
it
blow
fresh
up
here
<EOS>
---
they
look
down
on
Cloisterham
,
fair
to
see
in
the
moonlight
:
 
its
ruined
habitation
and
sanctuary
of
the
dead
,
at
the
tower
's
base
:
 
its
moss
-
soften
red
-
tile
roof
and
red
-
brick
house
of
the
living
,
cluster
beyond
:
 
<EOS>
its
river
wind
down
from
the
mist
on
the
horizon
,
as
though
that
be
its
source
,
and
already
heave
with
a
restless
knowledge
of
its
approach
towards
the
sea
.
   
<EOS>
once
again
,
an
unaccountable
expedition
this
!
 
<EOS>
Jasper
(
always
move
softly
with
no
visible
reason
)
contemplate
the
scene
,
and
especially
that
still
part
of
it
which
the
cathedral
overshadow
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
contemplate
Durdles
quite
as
curiously
,
and
Durdles
be
by
time
conscious
of
his
watchful
eye
.
   
<EOS>
only
by
time
,
because
Durdles
be
grow
drowsy
.
 
<EOS>
as
aeronaut
lighten
the
load
they
carry
,
when
they
wish
to
rise
,
similarly
Durdles
have
lighten
the
wicker
bottle
in
come
up
.
 
<EOS>
snatch
of
sleep
surprise
him
on
his
leg
,
and
stop
him
in
his
talk
.
 
<EOS>
a
mild
fit
of
calenture
seize
him
,
in
which
he
deem
that
the
ground
so
far
below
,
be
on
a
level
with
the
tower
,
and
would
as
lief
walk
off
the
tower
into
the
air
as
not
.
 
<EOS>
such
be
his
state
when
they
begin
to
come
down
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
aeronaut
make
themselves
heavy
when
they
wish
to
descend
,
similarly
Durdles
charge
himself
with
more
liquid
from
the
wicker
bottle
,
that
he
may
come
down
the
well
.
   
<EOS>
the
iron
gate
attain
and
lock
---
but
not
before
Durdles
have
tumble
twice
,
and
cut
an
eyebrow
open
once
---
they
descend
into
the
crypt
again
,
with
the
intent
of
issue
forth
as
they
enter
.
<EOS>
but
,
while
return
among
those
lane
of
light
,
Durdles
become
so
very
uncertain
,
both
of
foot
and
speech
,
that
he
half
drop
,
half
throw
himself
down
,
by
one
of
the
heavy
pillar
,
scarcely
less
heavy
than
itself
,
and
indistinctly
appeal
to
his
companion
for
forty
wink
of
a
second
each
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
have
it
so

it
so

reply
Jasper

"
I

here

<EOS>
Durdles
be
asleep
at
once
;
and
in
his
sleep
he
dream
a
dream
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
much
of
a
dream
,
consider
the
vast
extent
of
the
domain
of
dreamland
,
and
their
wonderful
production
;
it
be
only
remarkable
for
be
unusually
restless
and
unusually
real
.
 
<EOS>
He
dream
of
lie
there
,
asleep
,
and
yet
count
his
companion
's
footstep
as
he
walk
to
and
fro
.
 
<EOS>
He
dream
that
the
footstep
die
away
into
distance
of
time
and
of
space
,
and
that
something
touch
him
,
and
that
something
fall
from
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
then
something
clink
and
grope
about
,
and
he
dream
that
he
be
alone
for
so
long
a
time
,
that
the
lane
of
light
take
new
direction
as
the
moon
advance
in
her
course
.
 
<EOS>
from
succeed
unconsciousness
he
pass
into
a
dream
of
slow
uneasiness
from
cold
;
and
painfully
awake
to
a
perception
of
the
lane
of
light
---
really
change
,
much
as
he
have
dream

and
Jasper
walk
among

beat
his

he
look
down
on

close

"

They

do
we
say
,
on

an
occasion
,
in

another
good

<EOS>
and
when
the

those
pursuit
which
(
here
a

then
let

ever
remember
what
be

by

in

too
trite
for

,
at
the
battle
it
be
superfluous
to
specify
.
   
<EOS>
the
handmaiden
of
the
establishment
,
in
their
good

,
then
hand
the
tray
,
and
the
young

sip
and
crumble
,
and
the
bespoken
coach
begin
to
choke
the
street

<EOS>
then
leave

taking

and
Miss

in

confide
to

an
exceedingly
neat
letter
,
address

with
Miss

good

in

corner

<EOS>
this
missive
she
hand
with
an
air
as
if
it
have
not
the
least
connexion
with
the
bill
,
but
be
something
in
the
nature
of
a
delicate
and
joyful
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
so
many
time
have
Rosa
see
such
dispersal
,
and
so
very
little
<EOS>
do
she
know
of
any
other
Home
,
that
she
be
content
to
remain
where
she
be

and
be
even
better
contented
than
ever
before

have
her
late

<EOS>
and
yet
her
late
friendship
have
a
blank
place
in

of
which
she
could
not
fail
to
be
sensible
.
 
<EOS>
Helena
Landless
,
have
be
a
party
to
her
brother
's
revelation
about
Rosa
,
and
have
enter
into
that
compact
of
silence
with
Mr
Crisparkle
,
shrink
from
any
allusion
to
Edwin
Drood
's
name
.
 
<EOS>
why
she
so
avoid
it
,
be
mysterious
to
Rosa
,
but
she
perfectly
perceive
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
but
for
the
fact
,
she
may
have
relieve
her
own
little
perplex
heart
of
some
of
its
doubt
and
hesitation
,
by
take
Helena
into
her
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
she
have
no
such
vent
:
 
<EOS>
she
could
only
ponder
on
her
own
difficulty
,
and
wonder
more
and
more
why
this
avoidance
of
Edwin
's
name
should
last
,
now
that
she
know
---
for
so
much
Helena
have
tell
her
---
that
a
good
understanding
be
to
be
reestablish
between
the
two
young
man
,
when
Edwin
come
down
.
   
<EOS>
It
would
have
make
a
pretty
picture
,
so
many
pretty
girl
kiss
Rosa
in
the
cold
porch
of
the
Nuns
'
House
,
and
that
sunny
little
creature
peep
out
of
it
<EOS>
(
unconscious
of
sly
face
carve
on
spout
and
gable
peeping
at
her
)
,
and
wave
farewell
to
the
depart
coach
,
as
if
she
represent
the
spirit
of
rosy
youth
abide
in
the
place
to
keep
it
bright
and
warm
in
its
desertion
.
<EOS>
the
hoarse
High
Street
become
musical
with
the
cry
,
in
various
silvery
voice
,
"
good
-
bye
,
Rosebud
darling
!
"
and
the
effigy
of
Mr
Sapsea
's
father
over
the
opposite
doorway
seem
to
say
to
mankind
:
"
gentleman
,
favour
me
with
your
attention
to
this
charming
little
last
lot
leave
behind
,
and
bid
with
a
spirit
worthy
of
the
occasion
!
"
 
<EOS>
then
the
staid
street
,
so
unwontedly
sparkling
,
youthful
,
and
fresh
for
a
few
ripple
moment
,
run
dry
,
and
Cloisterham
be
itself
again
.
   
<EOS>
if
Rosebud
in
her
bower
now
wait
Edwin
Drood
be
come
with
an
uneasy
heart
,
Edwin
for
his
part
be
uneasy
too
.
 
<EOS>
with
far
less
force
of
purpose
in
his
composition
than
the
childish
beauty
,
crown
by
acclamation
fairy
queen
of
Miss
Twinkleton
's
establishment
,
he
have
a
conscience
,
and
Mr
Grewgious
have
prick
it
.
 
<EOS>
that
gentleman
's
steady
conviction
of
what
be
right
and
what
be
wrong
in
such
a
case
as
his
,
be
neither
to
be
frown
aside
nor
laugh
aside
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
not
be
move
.
 
<EOS>
but
for
the
dinner
in
Staple
Inn
,
and
but
for
the
ring
he
carry
in
the
breast
pocket
of
his
coat
,
he
would
have
drift
into
their
wedding
-
day
without
another
pause
for
real
thought
,
loosely
trust
that
all
would
go
well
,
leave
alone
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
serious
put
him
on
his
truth
to
the
living
and
the
dead
have
bring
him
to
a
check
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
either
give
the
ring
to
Rosa
,
or
he
must
take
it
back
.
 
<EOS>
once
put
into
this
narrow
way
of
action
,
it
be
curious
that
he
begin
to
consider
Rosa
's
claim
upon
him
more
unselfishly
than
he
have
ever
consider
them
before
,
and
begin
to
be
less
sure
of
himself
than
he
have
ever
be
in
all
his
easy
-
go
day
.

"
I

knit
her

musingly

then
flash
out
with
the
bright
little
induction
:

"
well
,
but
say
they
do

<EOS>
surely
it
be
not
enough
that
you
should

only
as
other
people
do

now
,
be
it
?

<EOS>
the
point

not

get
over

be
not

"
You
like
me
very
well

you

grow
use

grow
use

You
accept
the

It

you

why

it

"
   
<EOS>
It
be
new
and
strange
to
him
to
have
himself
present
to
himself
so
clearly
,
in
a
glass
of
her
hold
up
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
always
patronise
her
,
in
his
superiority
to
her
share
of
woman
's
wit

<EOS>
be
that
but
another
instance
of
something
radically
amiss
in
the
term
on
which
they
have
be
glide
towards
a
life

long
bondage

<EOS>
"
all
this
that
I
say
of
you

true

well

Eddy

<EOS>
unless
it
be
,
I
may
not
be
bold
enough
to
say
it

<EOS>
only
,
the
difference
between
us
be
,
that
by
little
and
little
there
creep
into
my

a
habit
of
think
about
it

instead
of
dismiss
it

My
life
be
not

busy
as
yours

you
see

I
have
not
so
many
thing
to
think
of

so
I
think
about
it
very
much
,

I
cry
about
it
very
much
too

though
that
be
not
your
fault

when
all
at

down

hint

good

put
before

kindly

so
strongly

how
seriously
we
ought

consider
,
in

speak
to
you
the
next

grave

it
easily

do

unkindly

it
appear

instantly
recall

down

confused

which

the
secret
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
tell
you

be
another
reason
for
your
guardian
's
make
the
communication
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
so
steady
,
precise
,
and
exact
,
that
he
will
talk
Jack
's
thought
into
shape
,
in
no
time
:
 
whereas
with
me
Jack
be
always
impulsive
and
hurried
,
and
,
I
may
say
,
almost
womanish
.
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
seem
convinced

<EOS>
perhaps
from
her
own
very
different
point
of
view
of

Jack

"
she
feel
comfort
and
protect
by
the
interposition
of
Mr
Grewgious
between
herself
and
him
.
   
<EOS>
and
now
,
Edwin
Drood
's
right
hand
close
again
upon
the
ring
in
its
little
case
,
and
again
be
check
by
the
consideration
:
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
certain
,
now
,
that
I
be
to
give
it
back
to
him
;
then
why
should
I
tell
her
of
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
that
pretty
sympathetic
nature
which
could
be
so
sorry
for
him
in
the
blight
of
their
childish
hope
of
happiness
together
,
and
could
so
quietly
find
itself
alone
in
a
new
world
to
weave
fresh
wreath
of
such
flower
as
it
may
prove
to
bear
,
the
old
world
's
flower
be
wither
,
would
be
grieve
by
those
sorrowful
jewel
;
and
to
what
purpose
?
 
<EOS>
why
should
it
be
?
 
<EOS>
They
be
but
a
sign
of
broken
joy
and
baseless
project
;
in
their
very
beauty
they
be
(
as
the
unlikeliest
of
man
have
say
)
<EOS>
almost
a
cruel
satire
on
the
love
,
hope
,
plan
,
of
humanity
,
which
be
able
to
forecast
nothing
,
and
be
so
much
brittle
dust
.
 
<EOS>
let
them
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
restore
them
to
her
guardian
when
he
come
down
;
he
in
his
turn
would
restore
them
to
the
cabinet
from
which
he
have
unwillingly
take
them
;
and
there
,
like
old
letter
or
old
vow
,
or
other
record
of
old
aspiration
come
to
nothing
,
they
would
be
disregard
,
until
,
be
valuable
,
they
be
sell
into
circulation
again
,
to
repeat
their
former
round
.
   
<EOS>
let
them
be

<EOS>
let
them
lie
unspoken
of

in
his
breast
.
 
<EOS>
however
distinctly
or
indistinctly
he
entertain
these
thought
,
he
arrive
at
the
conclusion
,
let
them
be
.
 
<EOS>
among
the
mighty
store
of
wonderful
chain
that
be
for
ever
forge
,
day

night
,
in
the
vast
iron

work

there
be

small
conclusion

rivet
to
the
foundation

heaven

<EOS>
They
walk
on
by
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
They
begin
to
speak
of
their
separate
plan
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
quicken
his
departure
from
England
,
and
she
would
remain
where
she
be
,
at
least
as
long
as
Helena
remain
.
 
<EOS>
the
poor
dear
girl
should
have
their
disappointment
break
to
them
gently
,
and
,
as
the
first
preliminary
,
Miss
Twinkleton
should
be
confide
in
by
Rosa
,
even
in
advance
of
the
reappearance
of
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
It
should
be
make
clear
in
all
quarter
that
she
and
Edwin
be
the
good
of
friend
.
 
<EOS>
there
have
never
be
so
serene
an
understanding
between
them
since
they
be
first
affiance
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
there
be
one
reservation
on
each
side
;
on
her
,
that
she
intend
through
her
guardian
to
withdraw
herself
immediately
from
the
tuition
of
her
music
-
master
;
on
his
,
that
he
do
already
entertain
some
wander
speculation
whether
it
may
ever
come
to
pass
that
he
would
know
more
of
Miss
Landless
.
   
<EOS>
the
bright
,
frosty
day
decline
as
they
walk
and
speak
together
.
<EOS>
the
sun
dip
in
the
river
far
behind
them
,
and
the
old
city
lie
red
before
them
,
as
their
walk
draw
to
a
close
.
 
<EOS>
the
moan
water
cast
its
seaweed
duskily
at
their
foot
,
when
they
turn
to
leave
its
margin
;
and
the
rook
hover
above
them
with
hoarse
cry
,
darker
splash
in
the
darkening
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
prepare
Jack
for
my
flitting
soon

say
Edwin
,
in
a
low
voice
,

and
I
will
but
see
your
guardian
when
he
come

then
go
before
they
speak
together

<EOS>
It
will
be
better
do
without

towards
the

<EOS>
when

by
the
Cathedral

where
they
have
last

together

they
stop
as

Rosa
raise

She
hurry
on

without

,
and
hurry
on
until
they
have

under

gatehouse
into

She
pull
hurriedly
at

"
   
<EOS>

have
you
not
better
avoid
it
,
Neville
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
that
I
can
hear
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
hear
,
my
dear
,
what
Mr
Crisparkle
have
hear
,
and
hear
with
approval
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
can
hear
so
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
it
be
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
only
unsettled
and
unhappy
myself
,
but
I
be
conscious
of
unsettling
and
interfere
with
other
people
.
<EOS>
how
do
I
know
that
,
but
for
my
unfortunate
presence
,
you
,
and
---
and
---
the
rest
of
that
former
party
,
our
engage
guardian
except
,
may
be
dine
cheerfully
in
Minor
Canon
Corner
to
-
morrow
?
 
<EOS>
indeed
it
probably
would
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
see
too
well
that
I
be
not
high
in
the
old
lady
's
opinion
,
and
it
be
easy
to
understand
what
an
irksome
clog
I
must
be
upon
the
hospitality
of
her
orderly
house
---
especially
at
this
time
of
year
---
when
I
must
be
keep
asunder
from
this
person
,
and
there
be
such
a
reason
for
my
not
be
bring
into
contact
with
that
person
,
and
an
unfavourable
reputation
have
precede
me
with
such
another
person
;
and
so
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
put
this
very
gently
to
Mr
Crisparkle
,
for
you
know
his
self
-
deny
way
;
but
still
I
have
put
it
.
 
<EOS>
what
I
have
lay
much
great
stress
upon
at
the
same
time
be
,
that
I
be
engage
in
a
miserable
struggle
with
myself
,
and
that
a
little
change
and
absence
may
enable
me
to
come
through
it
the
well
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
the
weather
be
bright
and
hard
,
I
be
go
on
a
walk
expedition
,
and
intend
take
myself
out
of
everybody
's
way
(
my
own
include
,
I
hope
)
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
when
to
come
back
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
and
go
quite
alone
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
much
well
without
company
,
even
if
there
be
any
one
<EOS>
but
you
to
bear
me
company
,
my
dear
Helena
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Crisparkle
entirely
agree
,
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
entirely
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
sure
but
that
at
first
he
be
inclined
to
think
it
rather
a
moody
scheme
,
and
one
that
may
do
a
brood
mind
harm
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
take
a
moonlight
walk
last
Monday
night
,
to
talk
it
over
at
leisure
,
and
I
represent
the
case
to
him
as
it
really
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
show
him
that
I
do
want
to
conquer
myself
,
and
that
,
this
evening
well
get
over
,
it
be
surely
well
that
I
should
be
away
from
here
just
now
,
than
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
help
meet
certain
people
walk
together
here
,
and
that
could
do
no
good
,
and
be
certainly
not
the
way
to
forget
.
 
<EOS>
a
fortnight
hence
,
that
chance
will
probably
be
over
,
for
the
time
;
and
when
it
again
arise
for
the
last
time
,
why
,
I
can
again
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
farther
,
I
really
do
feel
hopeful
of
brace
exercise
and
wholesome
fatigue
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
that
Mr
Crisparkle
allow
such
thing
their
full
weight
in
the
preservation
of
his
own
sound
mind
in
his
own
sound
body
,
and
that
his
just
spirit
be
not
likely
to
maintain
one
set
of
natural
law
for
himself
and
another
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
yield
to
my
view
of
the
matter
,
when
convinced
that
I
be
honestly
in
earnest
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
with
his
full
consent
,
I
start
to
-
morrow
morning
.
 
<EOS>
early
enough
to
be
not
only
out
of
the
street
,
but
out
of
hearing
of
the
bell
,
when
the
good
people
go
to
church
.
"
   
<EOS>
Helena
think
it
over
,
and
think
well
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
do
so
<EOS>
,
she
would
do
so
;
but
she
do
originally
,
out
of
her
own
mind
,
think
well
of
it
,
as
a
healthy
project
,
denote
a
sincere
endeavour
and
an
active
attempt
at
self
-
correction
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
incline
to
pity
him
,
poor
fellow
,
for
go
away
solitary
on
the
great
Christmas
festival
;
but
she
feel
it
much
more
to
the
purpose
to
encourage
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
do
encourage
him
.
   
<EOS>
He
will
write
to
her
?
   
<EOS>
He
will
write
to
her
every
alternate
day
,
and
tell
her
all
his
adventure
.
   
<EOS>
do
he
send
clothe
on
in
advance
of
him
?
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Helena
,
no
.
 
travel
like
a
pilgrim
,
with
wallet
and
staff
.
<EOS>
My
wallet
---
or
my
knapsack
---
be
pack
,
and
ready
for
strap
on
;
and
here
be
my
staff
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
hand
it
to
her
;
she
make
the
same
remark
as
Mr
Crisparkle
,
that
it
be
very
heavy
;
and
give
it
back
to
him
,
ask
what
wood
it
be
?
 
<EOS>
iron
-
wood
.
   
<EOS>
up
to
this
point
he
have
be
extremely
cheerful
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
,
the
have
to
carry
his
case
with
her
,
and
therefore
to
present
it
in
its
bright
aspect
,
have
rouse
his
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
,
the
have
do
so
with
success
,
be
follow
by
a
revulsion
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
day
close
in
,
and
the
city
-
light
begin
to
spring
up
before
them
,
he
grow
depressed
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
be
not
go
to
this
dinner
,
Helena
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Neville
,
be
it
worth
while
to
care
much
about
it
?
 
<EOS>
think
how
soon
it
will
be
over
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
how
soon
it
will
be
over
!
"
<EOS>
he
repeat
gloomily
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
like
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
there
may
be
a
moment
's
awkwardness
,
she
cheeringly
represent
to
him
,
but
it
can
only
last
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
quite
sure
of
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
feel
as
sure
of
everything
else
,
as
I
feel
of
myself
,
"
he
answer
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
how
strangely
you
speak
,
dear
!
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Helena
,
I
do
not
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
know
that
I
do
not
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
strange
dead
weight
there
be
in
the
air
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
call
his
attention
to
those
copperous
cloud
beyond
the
river
,
and
say
that
the
wind
be
rise
.
 
<EOS>
He
scarcely
speak
again
,
until
he
take
leave
of
her
,
at
the
gate
of
the
Nuns
'
House
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
immediately
enter
,
when
they
have
part
,
but
remain
look
after
him
along
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
twice
he
pass
the
gatehouse
,
reluctant
to
enter
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
the
cathedral
clock
chime
one
quarter
,
with
a
rapid
turn
he
hurry
in
.
   
<EOS>
and
so
he
go
up
the
postern
stair
.
   
<EOS>
Edwin
Drood
pass
a
solitary
day
.
 
<EOS>
something
of
deep
moment
than
he
have
think
,
have
go
out
of
his
life
;
and
in
the
silence
of
his
own
chamber
he
weep
for
it
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
though
the
image
of
Miss
Landless
still
hover
in
the
background
of
his
mind
,
the
pretty
little
affectionate
creature
,
so
much
firm
and
wise
than
he
have
suppose
,
occupy
its
stronghold
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
with
some
misgiving
of
his
own
unworthiness
that
he
think
of
her
,
and
of
what
they
may
have
be
to
one
another
,
if
he
have
be
more
in
earnest
some
time
ago
;
if
he
have
set
a
high
value
on
her
;
if
,
instead
of
accept
his
lot
in
life
as
an
inheritance
of
course
,
he
have
study
the
right
way
to
its
appreciation
and
enhancement
.
 
<EOS>
and
still
,
for
all
this
,
and
though
there
be
a
sharp
heartache
in
all
this
,
the
vanity
and
caprice
of
youth
sustain
that
handsome
figure
of
Miss
Landless
in
the
background
of
his
mind
.
   
<EOS>
that
be
a
curious
look
of
Rosa
's
when
they
part
at
the
gate
.
<EOS>
do
it
mean
that
she
see
below
the
surface
of
his
thought
,
and
down
into
their
twilight
depth
?
 
<EOS>
scarcely
that
,
for
it
be
a
look
of
astonished
and
keen
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
He
decide
that
he
can
not
understand
it
,
though
it
be
remarkably
expressive
.
   
<EOS>
as
he
only
wait
for
Mr
Grewgious
now
,
and
will
depart
immediately
after
have
see
him
,
he
take
a
sauntering
leave
of
the
ancient
city
and
its
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
He
recall
the
time
when
Rosa
and
he
walk
here
or
there
,
mere
child
,
full
of
the
dignity
of
be
engage
.
 
<EOS>
poor
child
!
<EOS>
he
think
,
with
a
pity
sadness
.
   
<EOS>
find
that
his
watch
have
stop
,
he
turn
into
the
jeweller
's
shop
,
to
have
it
wind
and
set
.
 
<EOS>
the
jeweller
be
know
on
the
subject
of
a
bracelet
,
which
he
beg
leave
to
submit
,
in
a
general
and
quite
aimless
way
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
suit
(
he
consider
)
<EOS>
a
young
bride
,
to
perfection
;
especially
if
of
a
rather
diminutive
style
of
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
find
the
bracelet
but
coldly
look
at
,
the
jeweller
invite
attention
to
a
tray
of
ring
for
gentleman
;
here
be
a
style
of
ring
,
now
,
he
remark
---
a
very
chaste
signet
---
which
gentleman
be
much
give
to
purchasing
,
when
change
their
condition
.
 
<EOS>
a
ring
of
a
very
responsible
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
with
the
date
of
their
wedding
-
day
engrave
inside
,
several
gentleman
have
prefer
it
to
any
other
kind
of
memento
.
   
<EOS>
the
ring
be
as
coldly
view
as
the
bracelet
.
 
<EOS>
Edwin
tell
the
tempter
that
he
wear
no
jewellery
but
his
watch
and
chain
,
which
be
his
father
's
;
and
his
shirt
-
pin
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
I
be
aware

be
the
jeweller
's
reply
,

for
Mr
Jasper
drop
in
for
a
watch
-
glass
the
other
day
,
and
,
in
fact
,
I
show
these
article
to
him
,
remark
that
if
he
SHOULD
wish
to
make
a
present
to
a
gentleman
relative
,
on
any
particular
occasion
---
but
he
say
with
a
smile
that
he
have
an
inventory
in
his
mind
of
all
the
jewellery
his
gentleman
relative
ever
wear
;
namely
,
his
watch
and
chain
,
and
his
shirt
-
pin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
still
(
the
jeweller
consider
)
<EOS>
that
may
not
apply
to
all
time
,
though
apply
to
the
present
time
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
twenty
minute
past
two
,
Mr
Drood
,
I
set
your
watch
at
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
recommend
you
not
to
let
it
run
down
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Edwin
take
his
watch
,
put
it
on
,
and
go
out
,
think
:
 
"
<EOS>
dear
old
Jack
!
 
<EOS>
if
I
be
to
make
an
extra
crease
in
my
neckcloth
,
he
would
think
it
worth
notice
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
stroll
about
and
about
,
to
pass
the
time
until
the
dinner
-
hour
.
<EOS>
It
somehow
happen
that
Cloisterham
seem
reproachful
to
him
to
-
day
;
have
fault
to
find
with
him
,
as
if
he
have
not
use
it
well
;
but
be
far
more
pensive
with
him
than
angry
.
 
<EOS>
His
wonte
carelessness
be
replace
by
a
wistful
look
at
,
and
dwell
upon
,
all
the
old
landmark
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
soon
be
far
away
,
and
may
never
see
them
again
,
he
think
.
 
<EOS>
poor
youth
!
 
<EOS>
poor
youth
!
   
<EOS>
as
dusk
draw
on
,
he
pace
the
Monks
'
Vineyard
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
walk
to
and
fro
,
full
half
an
hour
by
the
cathedral
chime
,
and
it
have
close
in
dark
,
before
he
become
quite
aware
of
a
woman
crouch
on
the
ground
near
a
wicket
gate
in
a
corner
.
 
<EOS>
the
gate
command
a
cross
bye
-
path
,
little
use
in
the
gloaming
;
and
the
figure
must
have
be
there
all
the
time
,
though
he
have
but
gradually
and
lately
make
it
out
.
   
<EOS>
He
strike
into
that
path
,
and
walk
up
to
the
wicket
.
 
<EOS>
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
near
it
,
he
see
that
the
woman
be
of
a
haggard
appearance
,
and
that
her
weazen
chin
be
rest
on
her
hand
,
and
that
her
eye
be
stare
---
with
an
unwinking
,
blind
sort
of
steadfastness
---
before
her
.
   
<EOS>
always
kindly
,
but
move
to
be
unusually
kind
this
evening
,
and
have
bestow
kind
word
on
most
of
the
child
and
aged
people
he
have
meet
,
he
at
once
bend
down
,
and
speak
to
this
woman
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
you
ill
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
deary
,
"
she
answer
,
without
look
at
him
,
and
with
no
departure
from
her
strange
blind
stare
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
you
blind
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
deary
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
be
you
lost
,
homeless
,
faint
?
 
<EOS>
what
be
the
matter
,
that
you
stay
here
in
the
cold
so
long
,
without
move
?
"
   
<EOS>
by
slow
and
stiff
effort
,
she
appear
to
contract
her
vision
until
it
can
rest
upon
him
;
and
then
a
curious
film
pass
over
her
,
and
she
begin
to
shake
.
   
<EOS>
He
straighten
himself
,
recoil
a
step
,
and
look
down
at
her
in
a
dread
amazement
;
for
he
seem
to
know
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
Heaven
!
"
<EOS>
he
think
,
next
moment
.
 
<EOS>
"
like
Jack
that
night
!
"
   
<EOS>
as
he
look
down
at
her
,
she
look
up
at
him
,
and
whimper
:
 
<EOS>
"
My
lung
be
weakly
;
my
lung
be
dreffle
bad
.
 
<EOS>
poor
me
,
poor
me
,
my
cough
be
rattle
dry
!
"
and
cough
in
confirmation
horribly
.

this

alone

in

surround
by
vestige
of
old

decay
,
it
rather
have
a
tendency
to
call
a

into

He
make
for
the
better

light
street
,
and
resolve
as
he
walk
on
to
say
nothing
of
this
to

night
,
but
to
mention
it
to
Jack
(
who
alone
call
him
Ned

,
as
an
odd
coincidence

to

of

only
as
a
coincidence

not

anything

still
,
it
hold
to
him

as
many
thing
much

never

He
have
another
mile

so
,
to
linger
out

,
when
he
walk
over

by

river

the

word
be
in

in

angry
sky

in

troubled
water

in
the
flicker
light

<EOS>
there
be
some
solemn
echo
of
them
even
in
the
cathedral
chime
,
which
strike
a
sudden
surprise
to
his
heart
as
he
turn
in
under
the
archway
of
the
gatehouse

<EOS>
and
so
he
go
up
the
postern
stair
.
   
<EOS>
John
Jasper
pass
a
more
agreeable
and
cheerful
day
than
either
of
his
guest
.
 
<EOS>
have
no
music
-
lesson
to
give
in
the
holiday
season
,
his
time
be
his
own
,
but
for
the
cathedral
service
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
early
among
the
shopkeeper
,
order
little
table
luxury
that
his
nephew
like
.
 
<EOS>
His
nephew
will
not
be
with
him
long
,
he
tell
his
provision
-
dealer
,
and
so
must
be
pet
and
make
much
of
.
 
<EOS>
while
out
on
his
hospitable
preparation
,
he
look
in
on
Mr
Sapsea
;
and
mention
that
dear
Ned
,
and
that
inflammable
young
spark
of
Mr
Crisparkle
's
,
be
to
dine
at
the
gatehouse
to
-
day
,
and
make
up
their
difference
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
be
by
no
mean
friendly
towards
the
inflammable
young
spark
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
that
his
complexion
be
"
Un
-
English
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
when
Mr
Sapsea
have
once
declare
anything
to
be
Un
-
English
,
he
consider
that
thing
everlastingly
sink
in
the
bottomless
pit
.
   
<EOS>
John
Jasper
be
truly
sorry
to
hear
Mr
Sapsea
speak
thus
,
for
he
know
right
well
that
Mr
Sapsea
never
speak
without
a
meaning
,
and
that
he
have
a
subtle
trick
of
be
right
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
(
by
a
very
remarkable
coincidence
)
be
of
exactly
that
opinion
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
be
in
beautiful
voice
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
pathetic
supplication
to
have
his
heart
incline
to
keep
this
law
,
he
quite
astonish
his
fellow
by
his
melodious
power
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
never
sing
difficult
music
with
such
skill
and
harmony
,
as
in
this
day
's
Anthem
.
 
<EOS>
His
nervous
temperament
be
occasionally
prone
to
take
difficult
music
a
little
too
quickly
;
to
-
day
,
his
time
be
perfect
.
   
<EOS>
these
result
be
probably
attain
through
a
grand
composure
of
the
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
the
mere
mechanism
of
his
throat
be
a
little
tender
,
for
he
wear
,
both
with
his
singing
-
robe
and
with
his
ordinary
dress
,
a
large
black
scarf
of
strong
close
-
weave
silk
,
sling
loosely
round
his
neck
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
composure
be
so
noticeable
,
that
Mr
Crisparkle
speak
of
it
as
they
come
out
from
vesper
.
   
<EOS>
"
I

You

He
retrace
his

turn
down
past
it
to
the
gatehouse

He
sing
,
in

low
voice

with
delicate
expression
,
as
he
walk
along

It
still
seem
as

false
note

within
his
power

night

nothing

retard
him

<EOS>
arrive
thus
under

arched
entrance

his
dwelling

he
pause
for
an
instant
in
the
shelter

pull
off
that
great
black
scarf

bang
it
in

his

all

softened
sound

hum

it

flow

very

violent
rush

It

gale

lighted

the
strong
blast

<EOS>
Neville

wonder
in
how
long
a
time
after
he
have
go
,
the
sneezy
fire
of
damp
fagot
would
begin
to
make
somebody
else
warm
.
   
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
Tilted
Wagon
,
as
a
cool
establishment
on
the
top
of
a
hill
,
where
the
ground
before
the
door
be
puddle
with
damp
hoofs

trodden
straw
;
where

slap
a

with

cast
aground
upon
a
shelf

in
company
with
a
mouldy
tablecloth
and
a
green

handle
knife
,
in
a
sort
of
cast

iron
canoe
;
where
the
pale

faced
bread
shed
tear
of
crumb
over
its
shipwreck
in
another
canoe
;
where
the
family
linen
,
half
washed

dry

lead
a
public
life
of

about

where
everything
to

be
drunk
out
of

everything
else
be
suggestive
of
a
rhyme
to

;
the

Wagon

hardly

<EOS>
however
,
Man

in
the

be
not
critical
,
but
take
what
entertainment
he
could
get
,
and
go
on
again
after
a
long
rest
than
he
need
.
   
<EOS>
He
stop
at
some
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
house
,
hesitate
whether
to
pursue
the
road
,
or
to
follow
a
cart
track
between
two
high
hedgerow
,
which
lead
across
the
slope
of
a
breezy
heath
,
and
evidently
strike
into
the
road
again
by
-
and

by

<EOS>
He
decide
in
favour
of
this
latter
track
,
and
pursue
it
with
some
toil
;
the
rise
be
steep
,
and
the
way
wear
into
deep
rut

<EOS>
He
be
labour
along

pedestrian
behind
him

<EOS>
as
they
be
come
up
at
a
fast

his
,
he
stand
aside
,
against
one
of
the
high
bank
,
to
let
them
pass
.
 
<EOS>
but
their
manner
be
very
curious

<EOS>
only
four
of
them
pass
.
 
<EOS>
other
four
slacken
speed
,

loiter
as
intend

him
when

the
remainder
of
the
party
(
half
-
a

dozen
perhaps
)
turn
,
and
go
back
at
a
great
rate
.
   
<EOS>
He
look
at
the
four
behind
him
,
and
he
look
at
the
four
before
him

<EOS>
They
all
return
his
look
.
 
<EOS>
He
resume
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
the
four
in

go
on

constantly
look
back
;
the
four
in
the
rear
come
close
up
.
   
<EOS>
when
they
all
range
out
from
the
narrow
track
upon

open
slope
of
the
heath

this
order
be
maintain
,
let
him
diverge
as
he
would

either
side

there
be
no

room
to
doubt
that

beset
by
these
fellow

<EOS>
He
stop

as
a

when
I
find
myself
molest
by
eight
people
?
 
<EOS>
Could
I
dream
of
the
true
reason
when
they
would
give
me
none
at
all
?
"
   
<EOS>
They
admit
that
they
have
think
it
discreet
to
be
silent
,
and
that
the
struggle
have
take
place
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
the
very
man
who
have
see
it
look
darkly
at
the
smear
which
the
bright
cold
air
have
already
dry

<EOS>
"
We
must
return
,
Neville

Mr

come

<EOS>
They
set
forth
on
the
walk
back
;
and
the
other
,
with
one
exception
,
straggle
after
them
at
various
distance
.
 
<EOS>
Jasper
walk
on
the
other
side
of
Neville

and
never
quit
that
position

<EOS>
He
be
silent
,
while
Mr
Crisparkle
more
than
once
repeat
his
former
question
,
and
while
Neville
repeat
his
former
answer
;
also
,
while
they
both
hazard
some
explanatory
conjecture
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
obstinately
silent
,
because
Mr
Crisparkle
's
manner
directly
appeal
to
him
to
take
some
part
in
the
discussion
,
and
no
appeal
would
move
his
fix
face

<EOS>
when

draw
near

the
city

it
be
suggest
by
the
Minor
Canon
that
they
may
do
well
in
call
on
the
Mayor
at
once
,
he
assent
with
a
stern
nod
;
but
he
spake
no
word
until
they
stand
in
Mr
Sapsea
's
parlour
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
be
inform
by
Mr
Crisparkle
of
the
circumstance
under
which
they
desire
to
make
a
voluntary
statement
before
him
,
Mr
Jasper
break
silence
by
declare
that
he
place
his
whole
reliance
,
humanly
speak
,
on
Mr
Sapsea
's
penetration
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
conceivable
reason
why
his
nephew
should
have
suddenly
abscond
,
unless
Mr
Sapsea
could
suggest
one
,
and
then
he
would
defer
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
intelligible
likelihood
of
his
have
return
to
the
river
,
and
be
accidentally
drown
in
the
dark
,
unless
it
should
appear
likely
to
Mr
Sapsea
,
and
then
again
he
would
defer
.
<EOS>
He
wash
his
hand
as
clean
as
he
could
of
all
horrible
suspicion
,
unless
it
should
appear
to
Mr
Sapsea
that
some
such
be
inseparable
from
his
last
companion
before
his
disappearance
(
not
on
good
term
with
previously
)
,
and
then
,
once
more
,
he
would
defer
.
 
<EOS>
His
own
state
of
mind
,
he
be
distract
with
doubt
,
and
labour
under
dismal
apprehension
,
be
not
to
be
safely
trust
;
but
Mr
Sapsea
's
be
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
express
his
opinion
that
the
case
have
a
dark
look
;
in
short
(
and
here
his
eye
rest
full
on
Neville
's
countenance
)
,
an
Un
-
English
complexion
.
 
<EOS>
have
make
this
grand
point
,
he
wander
into
a
denser
haze
and
maze
of
nonsense
than
even
a
mayor
may
have
be
expect
to
disport
himself
in
,
and
come
out
of
it
with
the
brilliant
discovery
that
to
take
the
life
of
a
fellow
-
creature
<EOS>
be
to
take
something
that
do
not
belong
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
He
waver
whether
or
no
he
should
at
once
issue
his
warrant
for
the
committal
of
Neville
Landless
to
jail
,
under
circumstance
of
grave
suspicion
;
and
he
may
have
go
so
far
as
to
do
it
but
for
the
indignant
protest
of
the
Minor
Canon
:
 
who
undertake
for
the
young
man
's
remain
in
his
own
house
,
and
be
produce
by
his
own
hand
,
whenever
demand
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
then
understand
Mr
Sapsea
to
suggest
that
the
river
should
be
drag
,
that
its
bank
should
be
rigidly
examine
,
that
particular
of
the
disappearance
should
be
send
to
all
outlying
place
and
to
London
,
and
that
placard
and
advertisement
should
be
widely
circulate
implore
Edwin
Drood
,
if
for
any
unknown
reason
he
have
withdraw
himself
from
his
uncle
's
home
and
society
,
to
take
pity
on
that
love
kinsman
's
sore
bereavement
and
distress
,
and
somehow
inform
him
that
he
be
yet
alive
.
 
<EOS>
Mr

be
perfectly
understand
,
for
this
be
exactly
his

It

horror

amazement
:
 
<EOS>
Neville

with
a
snort

may

yes

no

anything

Mrs

"
You

voraciously

an
evident
indifference
to

suggest
that
he
eat

to
fortify
himself
against
any

Mr

upright

a

imperturbably
polite
protest
all
over
him

he
would
have

in

some

from

piece

so
entirely
unexpected

so
destructive
of
all
the
castle
I
have
build

the

"
that
the
dear
lose
boy
have
withhold
anything
from
me
---
most
of
all
,
such
a
leading
matter
as
this
<EOS>
---
what
gleam
of
light
be
there
for
me
in
the
whole
black
sky

<EOS>
when
I
suppose
that
his
intend
wife
be
here
,
and
his
marriage
close
at
hand
,
how
could
I
entertain
the
possibility
of
his
voluntarily
leave
this
place
,
in
a
manner
that
would
be
so
unaccountable
,
capricious
,

cruel

now
that
I
know
what
you
have
tell
me

be
there
no
little
chink
through
which
day
pierce
?
 
<EOS>
suppose
him
to
have
disappear
of

not
his

less
cruel

the

in
itself
a

go
away

It
do
not

departure

cruel

true

it
relieve
it

Jasper

still
pursue
the

with
ardour

,
as
he
do
so

brighten
with
hope

<EOS>
"
I

my

terrible
distrust

your

overpower
as

show
me

<EOS>
You
do
not
extinguish
it
when
I
state
it

but
admit
it
to
be
a
reasonable
hope

<EOS>
I
begin
to
believe
it
possible
:
"
here
he
clasp
his
hand
:
 
"
that
he
may
have
disappear
from

well

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
come
in
at
the
moment
.
 
<EOS>
to
whom
Mr
Jasper
repeat
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
believe
it
possible

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
take
a
seat
,
and
inquire
:
 
<EOS>
"
why
so
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
repeat
the
argument
he
have
just
set
forth
.
 
<EOS>
if
they
have
be
less
plausible
than
they
be
,
the
good
Minor
Canon
's
mind
would
have
be
in
a
state
of
preparation
to
receive
them
,
as
exculpatory
of
his
unfortunate
pupil
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
,
too
,
do
really
attach
great
importance
to
the
lose
young
man
's
have
be
,
so
immediately
before
his
disappearance
,
place
in
a
new
and
embarrassing
relation
towards
every
one
acquaint
with
his
project
and
affair
;
and
the
fact
seem
to
him
to
present
the
question
in
a
new
light
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
state
to
Mr
Sapsea
,
when
we
wait
on
him
,
"
say
Jasper
:
 
as
he
really
have
do
:
 
"
that
there
be
no
quarrel
or
difference
between
the
two
young
man
at
their
last
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
know
that
their
first
meeting
be
unfortunately
very
far
from
amicable
;
but
all
go
smoothly
and
quietly
when
they
be
last
together
at
my
house

<EOS>
My
dear
boy
be
not
in
his
usual
spirit
;
he
be
depressed
---
I
notice
that
---
and
I
be
bind
henceforth
to
dwell
upon
the
circumstance
the
more
,
now
that
I
know
there
be
a
special
reason
for
his
be
depress
:
 
<EOS>
a
reason
,
moreover
,
which
may
possibly
have
induce
him
to
absent
himself
.

I
pray
to

it
may
turn
out
so

Mr

<EOS>
"
I
pray
to
Heaven
it
may
turn
out
so

<EOS>
repeat
Jasper
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
<EOS>
---
and
Mr
Grewgious
should
now
know
likewise

that
I
take
a
great
prepossession
against
Mr
Neville
Landless
,
arise
out
of
his
furious
conduct
on
that
first
occasion

<EOS>
You
know
that
I
come
to
you
,
extremely
apprehensive
,
on
my

of
his
mad
violence

<EOS>
You
know

I
even
enter

show
the
entry

you

that
I
have
dark
foreboding
against
him

<EOS>
Mr

ought
to

the
whole
case

<EOS>
He
shall
not

through
any
suppression

mine

inform
of
a
part
of
it

keep
in
ignorance

I
wish
him
to
be
good
enough

communication
he
have

have
hopefully
influence
my
mind
,
in

of
its
have
be
,
before
this
mysterious
occurrence
take
place
,
profoundly
impressed
against
young
Landless
.
"
   
<EOS>
this
fairness
trouble
the
Minor
Canon
much
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
that
he
be
not
as
open
in
his
own
dealing
.
 
<EOS>
He
charge
against
himself
reproachfully
that
he
have
suppress
,
so
far
,
the
two
point
of
a
second
strong
outbreak
of
temper
against
Edwin
Drood
on
the
part
of
Neville
,
and
of
the
passion
of
jealousy
have
,
to
his
own
certain
knowledge
,
flame
up
in
Neville
's
breast
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
convince
of
Neville
's
innocence
of
any
part
in
the
ugly
disappearance
;
and
yet
so
many
little
circumstance
combine
so
woefully
against
him
,
that
he
dread
to
add
two
more
to
their
cumulative
weight
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
among
the
true
of
man
;
but
he
have
be
balance
in
his
mind
,
much
to
its
distress
,
whether
his
volunteering
to
tell
these
two
fragment
of
truth
,
at
this
time
,
would
not
be
tantamount
to
a
piecing
together
of
falsehood
in
the
place
of
truth

<EOS>
however
,
here
be
a
model
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
hesitate
no
longer
.
<EOS>
address
Mr
Grewgious
,
as
one
place
in
authority
by
the
revelation
he
have
bring
to
bear
on
the
mystery
(
and
surpassingly
Angular
Mr
Grewgious
become
when
he
find
himself
in
that
unexpected
position
)
,
Mr
Crisparkle
bear
his
testimony
to
Mr
Jasper
's
strict
sense
of
justice
,
and
,
express
his
absolute
confidence
in
the
complete
clearance
of
his
pupil
from
the
least
taint
of
suspicion
,
sooner
or
later
,
avow
that
his
confidence
in
that
young
gentleman
have
be
form
,
in
spite
of
his
confidential
knowledge
that
his
temper
be
of
the
hot
and
fierce
,
and
that
it
be
directly
incense
against
Mr
Jasper
's
nephew
,
by
the
circumstance
of
his
romantically
suppose
himself
to
be
enamour
of
the
same
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
the
sanguine
reaction
manifest
in
Mr
Jasper
be
proof
even
against
this
unlooke
-
for
declaration
.
 
<EOS>
It
turn
him
paler
;
but
he
repeat
that
he
would
cling
to
the
hope
he
have
derive
from
Mr
Grewgious
;
and
that
if
no
trace
of
his
dear
boy
be
find
,
lead
to
the
dreadful
inference
that
he
have
be
make
away
with
,
he
would
cherish
unto
the
last
stretch
of
possibility
the
idea
,
that
he
may
have
abscond
of
his
own
wild
will
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
it
fall
out
that
Mr
Crisparkle
,
go
away
from
this
conference
still
very
uneasy
in
his
mind
,
and
very
much
troubled
on
behalf
of
the
young
man
whom
he
hold
as
a
kind
of
prisoner
in
his
own
house
,
take
a
memorable
night
walk
.
   
<EOS>
He
walk
to
Cloisterham
Weir
.
   
<EOS>
He
often
do
so
,
and
consequently
there
be
nothing
remarkable
in
his
footstep
tend
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
preoccupation
of
his
mind
so
hinder
him
from
plan
any
walk
,
or
take
heed
of
the
object
he
pass
,
that
his
first
consciousness
of
be
near
the
Weir
,
be
derive
from
the
sound
of
the
fall
water
close
at
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
how
do
I
come
here
!
"
<EOS>
be
his
first
thought
,
as
he
stop
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
do
I
come
here
!
"
<EOS>
be
his
second
.
   
<EOS>
then
,
he
stand
intently
listen
to
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
a
familiar
passage
in
his
reading
,
about
airy
tongue
that
syllable
man
's
name
,
rise
so
unbidden
to
his
ear
<EOS>
,
that
he
put
it
from
him
with
his
hand
,
as
if
it
be
tangible
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
starlight
.
 
<EOS>
the
Weir
be
full
two
mile
above
the
spot
to
which
the
young
man
have
repair
to
watch
the
storm
.
 
<EOS>
no
search
have
be
make
up
here
,
for
the
tide
have
be
run
strongly
down
,
at
that
time
of
the
night
of
Christmas
Eve
,
and
the
likeliest
place
for
the
discovery
of
a
body
,
if
a
fatal
accident
have
happen
under
such
circumstance
,
all
lay
---
both
when
the
tide
ebb
,
and
when
it
flow
again
---
between
that
spot
and
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
the
water
come
over
the
Weir
,
with
its
usual
sound
on
a
cold
starlight
night
,
and
little
could
be
see
of
it
;
yet
Mr
Crisparkle
have
a
strange
idea
that
something
unusual
hang
about
the
place
.
   
<EOS>
He
reason
with
himself
:
 
<EOS>
what
be
it
?
 
<EOS>
where
be
it
?
 
<EOS>
put
it
to
the
proof
.
 
<EOS>
which
sense
do
it
address
?
   
<EOS>
no
sense
report
anything
unusual
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
listen
again
,
and
his
sense
of
hear
again
check
the
water
come
over
the
Weir
,
with
its
usual
sound
on
a
cold
starlight
night
.
   
<EOS>
know
very
well
that
the
mystery
with
which
his
mind
be
occupy
,
may
of
itself
give
the
place
this
haunt
air
,
he
strain
those
hawk
's
eye
of
his
for
the
correction
of
his
sight
.
<EOS>
He
get
closer
to
the
Weir
,
and
peer
at
its
well
-
know
post
and
timber
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
in
the
least
unusual
be
remotely
shadow
forth
.
<EOS>
but
he
resolve
that
he
would
come
back
early
in
the
morning
.
   
<EOS>
the
Weir
run
through
his
broken
sleep
,
all
night
,
and
he
be
back
again
at
sunrise
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
bright
frosty
morning
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
composition
before
him
,
when
he
stand
where
he
have
stand
last
night
,
be
clearly
discernible
in
its
minute
detail
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
survey
it
closely
for
some
minute
,
and
be
about
to
withdraw
his
eye
,
when
they
be
attract
keenly
to
one
spot
.
   
<EOS>
He
turn
his
back
upon
the
Weir
,
and
look
far
away
at
the
sky
,
and
at
the
earth

and
then
look
again
at
that
one
spot

<EOS>
It
catch
his
sight
again
immediately
,
and
he
concentrate
his
vision
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
lose
it
now
,
though
it
be
but
such
a
speck
in
the
landscape

<EOS>
It
fascinate
his
sight
.
 
<EOS>
His
hand
begin
pluck
off
his
coat

<EOS>
for
it
strike
him
that
at
that
spot
---
a
corner
of
the
Weir
---
something
glisten
,
which
do
not
move
and
come
over
with
the
glisten
water
-
drop
,
but
remain
stationary
.
   
<EOS>
He
assure
himself
of
this
,
he
throw
off
his
clothe
,
he
plunge
into
the
icy
water
,
and
swam
for
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
climb
the
timber
,
he
take
from
them
,
catch
among
their
interstice
by
its
chain
,
a
gold
watch
,
bear
engrave
upon
its
back
e*d.
   
<EOS>
He
bring
the
watch
to
the
bank
,
swam
to
the
Weir
again
,
climb
it
,
and
dive
off
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
every
hole
and
corner
of
all
the
depth
,
and
dive
and
dive
and
dive
,
until
he
could
bear
the
cold
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
His
notion
be
,
that
he
would
find
the
body
;
he
only
find
a
shirt
-
pin
sticking
in
some
mud
and
ooze

<EOS>
with
these
discovery
he
return
to
Cloisterham

and
,
take
Neville

him
,
go
straight
to
the

<EOS>
Mr

be
send
for
,
the

pin
be
identify
,
Neville
be
detain
,
and
the
wild
frenzy
and
fatuity
of
evil
report
rise
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
of
that
vindictive
and
violent
nature
,
that
but
for
his
poor
sister
,
who
alone
have
influence
over
him
,
and
out
of
whose
sight
he
be
never
to
be
trust
,
he
would
be
in
the
daily
commission
of
murder
.
 
<EOS>
before

he
have
cause

everybody

He

He

He
have
repeatedly

<EOS>
He
have
be
bring
down
to
Cloisterham
,
from
London
,
by
an
eminent
Philanthropist
,
and
why
?
 
<EOS>
because
that
Philanthropist
have
expressly
declare
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
owe
it
to
my
fellow
-
creature
that
he
should
be
,
in
the
word
of
BENTHAM
,
where
he
be
the
cause
of
the
great
danger
to
the
small

.
"
   
<EOS>
these
drop
shot
from
the
blunderbuss
of
blunderheadedness
may
not
have
hit
him
in
a
vital
place
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
to
stand
against
a
train
and
well
-
direct
fire
of
arm
of
precision
too
.
<EOS>
He
have
notoriously
threaten
the
lose
young
man
,
and
have
,
accord
to
the
showing
of
his
own
faithful
friend
and
tutor
who
strove
so
hard
for
him
,
a
cause
of
bitter
animosity
(
create
by
himself
,
and
state
by
himself
)
,
against
that
ill
-
star
fellow
.
<EOS>
He
have
arm
himself
with
an
offensive
weapon
for
the
fatal
night
,
and
he
have
go
off
early
in
the
morning
,
after
make
preparation
for
departure
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
find
with
trace
of
blood
on
him
;
truly
,
they
may
have
be
wholly
cause
as
he
represent
,
but
they
may
not
,
also
.
 
<EOS>
on
a
search
-
warrant
being
issue
for
the
examination
of
his
room
,
clothe
,
and
so
forth
,
it
be
discover
that
he
have
destroy
all
his
paper
,
and
rearrange
all
his
possession
,
on
the
very
afternoon
of
the
disappearance
.
 
<EOS>
the
watch
find
at
the
Weir
be
challenge
by
the
jeweller
as
one
he
have
wind
and
set
for
Edwin
Drood
,
at
twenty
minute
past
two
on
that
same
afternoon
;
and
it
have
run
down
,
before
be
cast
into
the
water
;
and
it
be
the
jeweller
's
positive
opinion
that
it
have
never
be
re
-
wound
.
 
<EOS>
this
would
justify
the
hypothesis
that
the
watch
be
take
from
him
not
long
after
he
leave
Mr
Jasper
's
house
at
midnight
,
in
company
with
the
last
person
see
with
him
,
and
that
it
have
be
throw
away
after
be
retain
some
hour
.
 
<EOS>
why
throw
away
?
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
be
murder
,
and
so
artfully
disfigured
,
or
conceal
,
or
both
,
as
that
the
murderer
hope
identification
to
be
impossible
,
except
from
something
that
he
wear
,
assuredly
the
murderer
would
seek
to
remove
from
the
body
the
most
lasting
,
the
best
know
,
and
the
most
easily
recognisable
,
thing
upon
it
.
<EOS>
those
thing
would
be
the
watch
and
shirt
-
pin
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
his
opportunity
of
cast
them
into
the
river
;
if
he
be
the
object
of
these
suspicion
,
they
be
easy
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
he
have
be
see
by
many
person
,
wander
about
on
that
side
of
the
city
---
indeed
on
all
side
of
it
---
in
a
miserable
and
seemingly
half
-
distract
manner
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
choice
of
the
spot
,
obviously
such
criminate
evidence
have
better
take
its
chance
of
be
find
anywhere
,
rather
than
upon
himself
,
or
in
his
possession
.
 
<EOS>
concern
the
reconciliatory
nature
of
the
appoint
meeting
between
the
two
young
man
,
very
little
could
be
make
of
that
in
young
Landless
's
favour
;
for
it
distinctly
appear
that
the
meeting
originate
,
not
with
him
,
but
with
Mr
Crisparkle
,
and
that
it
have
be
urge
on
by
Mr
Crisparkle
;
and
who
could
say
how
unwillingly
,
or
in
what
ill

condition
mood
,
his
enforced
pupil
have
go
to
it
?
 
<EOS>
the
more
his
case
be
look
into
,
the
weak
it
become
in
every
point
.
 
<EOS>
even
the
broad
suggestion
that
the
lose
young
man
have
abscond
,
be
render
additionally
improbable
on
the
showing
of
the
young
lady
from
whom
he
have
so
lately
part
;
for
;
what
do
she
say
,
with
great
earnestness
and
sorrow
,
when
interrogate
?
 
<EOS>
that
he
have
,
expressly

enthusiastically

plan
with

that
he
would
await
the
arrival
of
her
guardian
,
Mr
Grewgious

and
yet

on
the
suspicion
thus

,
Neville

and
the

but
nothing
more
be

<EOS>
no

which
prove
the

it

Neville

then

a

Mr

well

<EOS>
Neville
must
leave
the
place

for
the
place
shun
him
and
cast
him
out

<EOS>
even
have
it
not

the

a

the

thirdly

empower
them

hit
him
anywhere

kick
him

stamp

Mr

I

comment
on
the
introduction
of
platform
manner

platform
manoeuvre
among

forbearance

<EOS>
but
you
have
give
me
such
a
speciman

that
I
should
be
a

for
both

I
remain
silent
respect

detestable

They

<EOS>
"
They
be
,
"
repeat
Mr

without

detestable

They
violate
equally
the
justice

<EOS>
You
assume

because
I
differ
from

what
be
your

<EOS>
instantly
to
turn
upon
me
,
charge
that
I
have
no

the
enormity
of
the
crime
itself

be
its
aider

abettor

<EOS>
so
,
another

take
me
as
represent
your
opponent

other

you
set
up
a
platform
credulity
;
a
moved

second

carry
-
unanimously
profession
of
faith
in
some
ridiculous
delusion
or
mischievous
imposition
.
 
<EOS>
I
decline
to
believe
it
,
and
you
fall
back
upon
your
platform
resource
of
proclaim
that
I
believe
nothing
;
that
because
I
will
not
bow
down
to
a
false
God
of
your

I
deny
the
true
God
!
 
<EOS>
another

you
make
the
platform
discovery
that
War
be

calamity
,
and
you
propose
to
abolish
it
by
a
string
of
twisted
resolution
toss
into

I
do
not

again

<EOS>
another

in
another

I
claim
consideration

presently

platform
proclamation

it

Mr

that

fall
into

soon

a

upon

go
along

wonder
what
the
china

have
say
if

him
pound
Mr

<EOS>
for
Mr

have
just
enough
of
harmless
vanity
to
hope
that
he
have
hit
hard
,

to
glow
with
the
belief
that
he
have
trim
the

Jacket
pretty
handsomely

He
take

turn
the

unbolted
door

stand
beside
the

hang
about

He

when

go
out

as
I
do
only

at
night

darkness
cover

courage

Mr

lay
a
hand
upon

stand
look
down
at

<EOS>
"
if
I

have
change

Neville

I
would
have
do
so

<EOS>
but
as
you
wisely
point
out
to
me
,
I
can
not
do
that
,
for
it
would
look
like
guilt
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
could
have
go
to
some
distant
place

I
may
have
find
relief
in
that
,

the
thing
be
not

for
the

reason

<EOS>
hide

escape
would
be
the
construction

<EOS>
It
seem
a

hard

tie
to
a
stake
,

innocent
;

I
do
not
complain

"
   
<EOS>

and
you
must
expect
no

you

Mr

compassionately

<EOS>

no

I

despondent
mood

cast
a
shadow
on

(
it

<EOS>
feel

quite
as
steady

have
render
it

excellent

Mr

what

I
have

not

me
to
study

beam
at

not

brightly

from

<EOS>
the
Minor
Canon
answer
:
 
"
Your

a

unreasonable

I

You

anew

first
speak
together

you
tell
me

your

rise
out

your
past

as
superior
to
you

you
remember

right
well

I
be

it

enthusiastic
flight

<EOS>
no

what
I
think
it
now

<EOS>
what
I
would
emphasise
be
,
that
under

your

opportune
example
to
you

so

take
this
one

<EOS>
Your

have
learn
how
to
govern
what
be
proud
in
her
nature
.
 
<EOS>
She
can
dominate
it
even
when
it
be
wound
through
her
sympathy
with
you

<EOS>
no
doubt
she
have
suffer
deeply
in
those

street
where
you
suffer
deeply
.
 
<EOS>
no
doubt
her
life
be
darken
by
the
cloud
that
darken
yours

<EOS>
but
bend
her
pride
into
a
grand
composure
that
be
not
haughty
or
aggressive
,
but
be
a
sustained
confidence
in
you
and
in
the
truth
,
she
have
win
her
way
through
those
street
until
she
pass
along
them
as
high
in
the
general
respect
as
any
one
who
tread
them
.
 
<EOS>
every
day
and
hour
of
her
life
since
Edwin
Drood
's
disappearance
,
she
have
face
malignity
and
folly
---
for
you
---
as
only
a
brave
nature
well
direct
can

<EOS>
so
it
will
be
with
her
to
the
end

<EOS>
another

weak

sink
break

but
never
such
a

know
no

the
pale
cheek

flush
under

imply
in

stoutly

Neville
reply

that
he

Mr

say
he

a
moment
's
call
to
make
on

with
his
preoccupied
glance
direct
out
at

Mr

Mr

kindly
step
round
here

in
the
gloom
of

cast
your
eye
at
the
second

floor

window
in
yonder
house

I
think
you
will
hardly
fail
to
see
a
slinking
individual

You

his

abruptly

Mr

:

what

you
say
that
our

up

passage

in

return
on
Mr
Crisparkle
's
mind
with
the
force
of
a
strong
recoil

and
he
ask
Mr
Grewgious
if
he
think
it
possible
that
Neville
be
to
be
harass
by
the
keeping
of
a
watch
upon
him

<EOS>
"
a
watch
?

repeat
Mr

musingly

"
ay
!

<EOS>
"
which
would
not
only
of
itself
haunt
and
torture
his
life
,
"
say
Mr
Crisparkle
warmly
,
"
but
would
expose
him
to
the
torment
of
a
perpetually
revive
suspicion

whatever
he

Mr

musingly
still

I

you

up

you
out

go
out
to
join
him

to
go
the
way
that
you

and
to
take
no

say
Mr

.
 
<EOS>
"
I
entertain
a
sort
of
fancy
for

him
under

night

<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
,
with
a
significant
need
comply
;
and
rejoin
Neville
,
go
away
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
dine
together
,
and
part
at
the
yet
unfinished
and
undeveloped
railway
station
:
 
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
to
get
home
<EOS>
;
Neville
to
walk
the
street
,
cross
the
bridge
,
make
a
wide
round
of
the
city
in
the
friendly
darkness
,
and
tire
himself
out
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
midnight
when
he
return
from
his
solitary
expedition
and
climb
his
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
the
night
be
hot
,
and
the
window
of
the
staircase
be
all
wide
open
.
 
<EOS>
come
to
the
top
,
it
give
him
a
pass
chill
of
surprise
<EOS>
(
there
be
no
room
but
his
up
there
)
to
find
a
stranger
sit
on
the
window
-
sill
,
more
after
the
manner
of
a
venturesome
glazier
than
an
amateur
ordinarily
careful
of
his
neck
;
in
fact
,
so
much
more
outside
the
window
than
inside
,
as
to
suggest
the
thought
that
he
must
have
come
up
by
the
water
-
spout
instead
of
the
stair
.
   
<EOS>
the
stranger
say
nothing
until
Neville
put
his
key
in
his
door
;
then

seem
to
make
sure
of
his
identity
from
the
action

he
speak
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
he
say
,
come
from
the
window
with
a
frank
and
smile
air
,
and
a
prepossessing
address

Neville

the
visitor
sit
down

<EOS>
a
handsome
gentleman
,
with
a
young
face
,
but
with
an
old
figure
in
its
robustness
and
its
breadth
of
shoulder
<EOS>
;
say
a
man
of
eight
-
and
-
twenty
,
or
at
the
utmost
thirty
;
so
extremely
sunburnt
that
the
contrast
between
his
brown
visage
and
the
white
forehead
shade
out
of
door
by
his
hat
,
and
the
glimpse
of
white
throat
below
the
neckerchief
,
would
have
be
almost
ludicrous
but
for
his
broad
temple
,
bright
blue
eye
,
cluster
brown
hair
,
and
laugh
tooth
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
notice
,

he
;
"
---
my
name
be
Tartar

"
   
<EOS>
Neville
incline
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
notice
(
excuse
me
)
that
you
shut
yourself
up
a
good
deal
,
and
that
you
seem
to
like
my
garden
aloft
here
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
would
like
a
little
more
of
it
,
I
could
throw
out
a
few
line
and
stay
between
my
window
and
your
,
which
the
runner
would
take
to
directly
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
some
box
,
both
of
mignonette
and
wall
-
flower
,
that
I
could
shove
on
along
the
gutter
(
with
a
boathook
I
have
by
me
)
to
your
window
,
and
draw
back
again
when
they
want
watering
or
gardening
,
and
shove
on
again
when
they
be
ship
-
shape
;
so
that
they
would
cause
you
no
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
take
this
liberty
without
ask
your
permission
,
so
<EOS>
I
venture
to
ask
it
.
 
<EOS>

,
correspond
set

<EOS>
"
You
be
very
kind

"
not
at
all

<EOS>
I
ought
to
apologise
for
look
in
so
late
.
 
<EOS>
but
have
notice
(
excuse
me
)
that
you
generally
walk
out
at
night
,
I
think
I
should
inconvenience
you
least
by
await
your
return

<EOS>
I
be
always
afraid
of
inconvenience
busy
man
,
be
an
idle
man

"
   
<EOS>

I

<EOS>

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
I
take
it
as
a
compliment

<EOS>
in
fact

I
be
breed
in
the
Royal
Navy

be
First
Lieutenant

but
,
an

in
the

leave
me
his
property
on
condition
that
I
leave
the
Navy

I
accept
the

well
,
I
have
have
twelve
or
fifteen
year
of
knock
about
first
.
<EOS>
I
come
here
some
nine
month
before
you
;
I
have
have
one
crop
before
you
come
.
 
<EOS>
I
choose
this
place
,
because
,
have
serve
last
in
a
little
corvette
,
I
know
I
should
feel
more
at
home
where
I
have
a
constant
opportunity
of
knock
my
head
against
the
ceiling
.
<EOS>
besides
,
it
would
never
do
for
a
man
who
have
be
aboard
ship
from
his
boyhood
to
turn
luxurious
all
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
again
;
have
be
accustom
to
a
very
short
allowance
of
land
all
my
life

I
think
I
would
feel
my
way
to
the
command
of
a
landed
estate

by
begin
in
box

<EOS>
whimsically
as
this
be

,
there
be
a
touch
of
merry
earnestness
in
it
that
make
it
doubly
whimsical
.
   
<EOS>
"
however
,
"
say
the
Lieutenant
,
"
I
have
talk
quite
enough
about
myself
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
my
way
,
I
hope
;
it
have
merely
be
to
present
myself
to
you
naturally
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
will
allow
me
to
take
the
liberty
I
have
describe
,
it
will
be
a
charity
,
for
it
will
give
me
something
more
to
do

<EOS>
and
you
be
not

suppose
that
it

entail
any
interruption

intrusion

you

at

with

attendance
on

of
very
modest
proportion
,

partook
of
the
character
of
a
cool
dungeon
.

Its

its

rather
seem

these

close

the
apartment
which
Mrs

Mr

however
,
be
more
appreciative

<EOS>
He
find
that

open
he
would
enjoy
the

use
for
their

ingress
a

side
stair
that
come
plump

open
outward
,
to
the
surprise

inconvenience
of
a

of
pedestrian
in

,
he
would
be
alone
,
as
in

He
find
the

moderate

everything

Mrs

she
have
no

<EOS>
perhaps
Mr

Mr

pardon
when
she
find
it
incumbent
on
her
to
correct
him
in

of
his
summary
of
the
fact

but
plead
that
he
be
merely
a
single
buffer
get
through
life
upon
his

as
idly
as
he
could
,
and
that
so
many
people
be
so
constantly
make
away
with
so
many
other

as
to
render
it
difficult
for

let
his
malevolence
loose
on
Helena
's
brother
.
   
<EOS>
Rosa
's
mind
throughout
the
last
six
month
have
be
stormily
confuse
.
 
<EOS>
a
half
-
form
,
wholly
unexpresse
suspicion
toss
in
it
,
now
heave
itself
up
,
and
now
sink
into
the
deep
;
now
gain
palpability
,
and
now
lose
it
.
 
<EOS>
Jasper
's
self
-
absorption
in
his
nephew
when
he
be
alive
,
and
his
unceasing
pursuit
of
the
inquiry
how
he
come
by
his
death
,
if
he
be
dead
,
be
theme
so
rife
in
the
place
,
that
no
one
appear
able
to
suspect
the
possibility
of
foul
play
at
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
ask
herself
the
question
,
"
be
I
so
wicked
in
my
thought
as
to
conceive
a
wickedness
that
other
can
not
imagine
?
"
 
<EOS>
then
she
have
consider
<EOS>
,
do
the
suspicion
come
of
her
previous
recoiling
from
him
before
the
fact
?
 
<EOS>
and
if
so
,
be
not
that
a
proof
of
its
baselessness
?
<EOS>
then
she
have
reflect
,
"
what
motive
could
he
have
,
accord
to
my
accusation
?
"
 
<EOS>
She
be
ashamed
to
answer
in
her
mind
,
"
the
motive
of
gain
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
cover
her
face
,
as
if
the
light
shadow
of
the
idea
of
found
murder
on
such
an
idle
vanity
be
a
crime
almost
as
great
.
   
<EOS>
She
run
over
in
her
mind
again
,
all
that
he
have
say
by
the
sun
-
dial
in
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
persist
in
treat
the
disappearance
as
murder
,
consistently
with
his
whole
public
course
since
the
finding
of
the
watch
and
shirt
-
pin
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
be
afraid
of
the
crime
be
trace
out
,
would
he
not
rather
encourage
the
idea
of
a
voluntary
disappearance
?
 
<EOS>
He
have
even
declare
that
if
the
tie
between
him
and
his
nephew
have
be
less
strong
,
he
may
have
sweep
"
even
him
"
away
from
her
side
.
 
<EOS>
be
that
like
his
have
really
do
so
?
 
<EOS>
He
have
speak
of
lay
his
six
month
'
labour
in
the
cause
of
a
just
vengeance
at
her
foot
.
 
<EOS>
Would
he
have
do
that
,
with
that
violence
of
passion
,
if
they
be
a
pretence
?
<EOS>
Would
he
have
range
them
with
his
desolate
heart
and
soul
,
his
waste
life
,
his
peace
and
his
despair
?
 
<EOS>
the
very
first
sacrifice
that
he
represent
himself
as
make
for
her
,
be
his
fidelity
to
his
dear
boy
after
death
.
 
<EOS>
surely
these
fact
be
strong
against
a
fancy
that
scarcely
dare
to
hint
itself
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
he
be
so
terrible
a
man
!
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
the
poor
girl
(
for
what
could
she
know
of
the
criminal
intellect
,
which
its
own
professed
student
perpetually
misread
,
because
they
persist
in
try
to
reconcile
it
with
the
average
intellect
of
average
man
,
instead
of
identify
it
as
a
horrible
wonder
apart
)
could
get
by
no
road
to
any
other
conclusion
than
that
he
be
a
terrible
man
,
and
must
be
flee
from
.
   
<EOS>
She
have
be
Helena
's
stay
and
comfort
during
the
whole
time
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
constantly
assure
her
of
her
full
belief
in
her
brother
's
innocence
,
and
of
her
sympathy
with
him
in
his
misery
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
have
never
see
him
since
the
disappearance
,
nor
have
Helena
ever
speak
one
word
of
his
avowal
to
Mr
Crisparkle
in
regard
of
Rosa
,
<EOS>
though
as
a
part
of
the
interest
of
the
case
it
be
well
know
far
and
wide
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
Helena
's
unfortunate
brother
,
to
her
,
and
nothing
more
.
 
<EOS>
the
assurance
she
have
give
her
odious
suitor
be
strictly
true
,
though
it
would
have
be
well
(
she
consider
now
)
if
she
could
have
restrain
herself
from
so
give
it
.
 
<EOS>
Afraid
of
him
as
the
bright
and
delicate
little
creature
be
,
her
spirit
swell
at
the
thought
of
his
know
it
from
her
own
lip
.
   
<EOS>
but
where
be
she
to
go
?
 
<EOS>
anywhere
beyond
his
reach
,
be
no
reply
to
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
Somewhere
must
be
think
of
.
 
<EOS>
She
determine
to
go
to
her
guardian
,
and
to
go
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
the
feeling
she
have
impart
to
Helena
on
the
night
of
their
first
confidence
,
be
so
strong
upon
her
---
the
feeling
of
not
be
safe
from
him
,
and
of
the
solid
wall
of
the
old
convent
be
powerless
to
keep
out
his
ghostly
following
of
her
---
that
no
reasoning
of
her
own
could
calm
her
terror
.
 
<EOS>
the
fascination
of
repulsion
have
be
upon
her
so
long
,
and
now
culminate
so
darkly
,
that
she
feel
as
if
he
have
power
to
bind
her
by
a
spell
.
 
<EOS>
glance
out
at
window
,
even
now
,
as
she
rise
to
dress
,
the
sight
of
the
sun
-
dial
on
which
he
have
lean
when
he
declare
himself
,
turn
her
cold
,
and
make
her
shrink
from
it
,
as
though
he
have
invest
it
with
some
awful
quality
from
his
own
nature
.
   
<EOS>
She
write
a
hurried
note
to
Miss
Twinkleton
,
say
that
she
have
sudden
reason
for
wish
to
see
her
guardian
promptly
,
and
have
go
to
him
;
also
,
entreat
the
good
lady
not
to
be
uneasy
,
for
all
be
well
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
hurry
a
few
quite
useless
article
into
a
very
little
bag
,
leave
the
note
in
a
conspicuous
place
,
and
go
out
,
softly
close
the
gate
after
her
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
time
she
have
ever
be
even
in
Cloisterham
High
Street
alone
.
 
<EOS>
but
know
all
its
way
and
winding
very
well
,
she
hurry
straight
to
the
corner
from
which
the
omnibus
depart
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
,
at
that
very
moment
,
go
off
.
   
<EOS>
"
stop
and
take
me
,
if
you
please
,
Joe
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
go
to
London
.
"
   
<EOS>
in
less
than
another
minute
she
be
on
her
road
to
the
railway
,
under
Joe
's
protection
.
<EOS>
Joe
wait
on
her
when
she
get
there
,
put
her
safely
into
the
railway
carriage
,
and
hand
in
the
very
little
bag
after
her
,
as
though
it
be
some
enormous
trunk
,
hundredweight
heavy
,
which
she
must
on
no
account
endeavour
to
lift
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
you
go
round
when
you
get
back
,
and
tell
Miss
Twinkleton
that
you
see
me
safely
off
,
Joe

"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Miss
---
<EOS>
and
I
would
not
mind
have
it
myself
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
Joe
do
not
articulate
the
last
clause
;
only
think
it
.
   
<EOS>
now
that
she
be
whirl
away
for
London
in
real
earnest
,
Rosa
be
at
leisure
to
resume
the
thought
which
her
personal
hurry
have
check
.
 
<EOS>
the
indignant
thought
that
his
declaration
of
love
soil
her
;
that
she
could
only
be
cleanse
from
the
stain
of
its
impurity
by
appeal
to
the
honest
and
true
;
support
her
for
a
time
against
her
fear
,
and
confirm
her
in
her
hasty
resolution
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
the
evening
grow
dark
and
dark
,
and
the
great
city
impend
nearer
and
nearer
,
the
doubt
usual
in
such
case
begin
to
arise
.
<EOS>
whether
this
be
not
a
wild
proceeding
,
after
all
;
how
Mr
Grewgious
may
regard
it
;
whether
she
should
find
him
at
the
journey
's
end
;
how
she
would
act
if
he
be
absent
;
what
may
become
of
her
,
alone
,
in
a
place
so
strange
and
crowd
;
how
if
she
have
but
wait
and
take
counsel
first
;
whether
,
if
she
could
now
go
back
,
she
would
not
do
it
thankfully
;
a
multitude
of
such
uneasy
speculation
disturb
her
,
more
and
more
as
they
accumulate
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
the
train
come
into
London
over
the
housetop
;
and
down
below
lie
the
gritty
street
with
their
yet
un

a

glow
,
on
a
hot

<EOS>
this
be
all
Rosa
know
of
her
destination
;
but
it
be
enough
to
send
her
rattle
away
again
in
a
cab
,
through
desert
of
gritty
street
,
where
many
people
crowd
at
the
corner
of
court
and
byway
to
get
some
air
,
and
where
many
other
people
walk
with
a
miserably
monotonous
noise
of
shuffling
of
foot
on
hot
paving
-
stone
,
and
where
all
the
people
and
all
their
surrounding
be
so
gritty
and
so
shabby
!
   
<EOS>
there
be
music
play
here

it

not
enliven

<EOS>
no

the

like

that

here
and
<EOS>
there
,
they
only
seem
to
evoke
echo
from
brick
surface
,
and
dust
from
everything

<EOS>
as
to
the
flat
wind

instrument
,
they
seem
to
have
crack
their
heart

soul
in
pining
for

<EOS>
Her
jingling
conveyance
stop
at

at
a
fast

closed

which
appear
to
belong
to
somebody
who
have
go
to

be
much
afraid

Rosa
,
discharge
her
conveyance
,
timidly
knock
at
this
gateway

and
be
let
in

very

all

by

no

Mr

she

with
a

far
from

<EOS>
Rosa
draw
near
to
him
in
the
twilight
of

He
see
her

he
say
,
in
an
undertone
:
 
"

<EOS>
Rosa
fall
upon
his
neck

with
tear

at
once
with
a
burst

little
foot

"
I

Mr

after
this
most
extraordinary
outburst
,
Mr

,
quite
beside
himself
,
plunge
about
the
room
,
to
all
appearance
undecided
whether
he
be
in
a
fit
of
loyal
enthusiasm

combative
denunciation

<EOS>
He
stop
and
say

wipe

the
respectful

on

he
help
her
to
remove
her
hat

disentangle
her
pretty

Mr

Mr

greatly
aggravate

<EOS>
Mr

shake
his

seriously

feel
the
offence
to
be
a
little
too
much
,
though
of
his

<EOS>
"
how
come
you
to
be
his

sir

"
ask
Rosa

<EOS>
"
a
question
that
naturally
follow
,
"
say
Mr

<EOS>
"
let
's
talk
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bazzard
's
father
,
be
a
Norfolk
farmer
,
would
have
furiously
lay
about
him
with
a
flail
,
a
pitch
-
fork
,
and
every
agricultural
implement
available
for
assault
purpose
,
on
the
slight
hint
of
his
son
's
have
write
a
play
.
 
<EOS>
so
the
son
,
bring
to
me
the
father
's
rent
(
which
I
receive
)
,
impart
his
secret
,
and
point
out
that
he
be
determined
to
pursue
his
genius
,
and
that
it
would
put
him
in
peril
of
starvation
,
and
that
he
be
not
form
for
it
.

<EOS>
"
for
pursue
his
genius
,
sir

"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
for
starvation
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
deny
the
position
,
that
Mr
Bazzard
be
not
form
to
be
starve
,
and
Mr
Bazzard
then
point
out
that
it
be
desirable
that
I
should
stand
between
him
and
a
fate
so
perfectly
unsuited
to
his
formation
.
 
<EOS>
in
that
way
Mr
Bazzard
become
my
clerk
,
and
he
feel
it
very
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
he
be
grateful
,
"
say
Rosa
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
quite
mean
that
,
my
dear

<EOS>
I
mean
,
that
he
feel
the
degradation
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
some
other
genius
that
Mr

have
become
acquaint
with
,
who
have
also
write
tragedy
,
<EOS>
which
likewise
nobody
will
on
any
account
whatever
hear
of
bring
out
,
and
these
choice
spirit
dedicate
their
play
to
one
another
in
a
highly
panegyrical
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bazzard
have
be
the
subject
of
one
of
these
dedication

<EOS>
now
,
you
know
,
I
never
have
a
play
dedicate
to
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
look
at
him
as
if
she
would
have
like
him
to
be
the
recipient
of
a
thousand
dedication
.
   
<EOS>
"
which
again
,
naturally
,
rub
against
the
grain
of
Mr
Bazzard

"
say
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
very
short
with
me
sometimes
,
and
then
I
feel
that
he
be
meditate

this
blockhead
be
my
master
!
 
<EOS>
a
fellow
who
could
not

on
pain
of
death

who
will
never
have

him

most
complimentary
congratulation
on
the
high
position
he
have
take
in
the
eye
of
posterity

"
 
<EOS>
very
trying
,
very
trying
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
in
give
him
direction
,
I
reflect
beforehand
:
 
<EOS>
"
perhaps
he
may
not
like
this
,
"
or
"
He
may
take
it
ill
if
I
ask
that
;

and
so
we
get
on
very
well

<EOS>
indeed
,
well
than
I
could
have
expect

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
be
the
tragedy
name

"
ask
Rosa

"
strictly

Mr

it

appropriate

It

I

come
out
at

<EOS>
It
be
not
hard
to
divine
that
Mr

have
relate
the
Bazzard
history
thus
fully
,
at

quite
as
much
for
the
recreation
of
his
ward
's
mind
from
the
subject
that
have
drive
her
there

as
for
the
gratification

be
social

communicative

<EOS>
and
now
,
my

he
say
at
this
point
,

you

tired

tell
me
more

Shelf

and

for

<EOS>
His

<EOS>
Paint

seem
to
be
keep

out

,
in
constant
readiness
to
obliterate
stray

<EOS>
no

ever
keep

<EOS>
on
this
bright
summer
day
,
a
neat
awning
be
rig
over
Mr
Tartar
's
flower
-
garden
as
only
a
sailor
can
rig
it
,
and
there
be
a
sea
-
go
air
upon
the
whole
effect
,
so
delightfully
complete
,
that
the
flower

garden
may
have
appertain
to
stern

window
afloat
,
and
the
whole
concern
may
have
bowl
away
gallantly
with
all
on
board
,
if
Mr

have
only
clap
to
his
lip
the
speaking
-
trumpet
that
be
sling
in
a
corner
,
and
give
hoarse
order
to
heave
the
anchor
up
,
look
alive
there
,
man
,
and
get
all
sail
upon
her
!
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tartar
do
the
honour
of
this
gallant
craft
be
of
a
piece
with
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
when
a
man
ride
an
amiable
hobby
that
shy
at
nothing
and
kick
nobody
,
it
be
only
agreeable
to
find
him
ride
it
with
a
humorous
sense
of
the
droll
side
of
the
creature
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
man
be
a
cordial
and
an
earnest
man
by
nature
,
and
withal
be
perfectly
fresh
and
genuine
,
it
may
be
doubt
whether
he
be
ever
see
to
great
advantage
than
at
such
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
so
Rosa
would
have
naturally
think
(
even
if
she
have
not
be
conduct
over
the
ship
with
all
the
homage
due
to
the
First
Lady
of
the
Admiralty
,
or
First
Fairy
of
the
Sea
)
,
that
it
be
charming
to
see
and
hear
Mr
Tartar
half
laugh
at
,
and
half
rejoice
in
,
his
various
contrivance
.
 
<EOS>
so
Rosa
would
have
naturally
think
,
anyhow
,
that
the
sunburnt
sailor
show
to
great
advantage
<EOS>
when
,
the
inspection
finish
,
he
delicately
withdraw
out
of
his
admiral
's
cabin
,
beseech
her
to
consider
herself
its
Queen
,
and
wave
her
free
of
his
flower
-
garden
with
the
hand
that
have
have
Mr
Crisparkle
's
life
in
it
.

<EOS>
how

together

so
near

so
very
unexpectedly

"
   
<EOS>
unexpectedly
indeed
,
among
the
dingy
gable
and
chimney
-
pot
of
P*J*T
's
connection
,
and
the
flower
that
have
spring
from

salt

<EOS>
but
Rosa

waking
,
tell
in

come

and
all
the
why

wherefore

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
Mr
Crisparkle
be
here
,
"
say
Rosa
,
in
rapid
conclusion
;
"
and
,
could
you
believe
it
?
<EOS>
long
ago

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
could

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes

it

Rosa

quickly
put
in
the
correction

<EOS>
"
I
do
not

<EOS>
"
It
be
very
nice
of
Mr

Rosa

he
could
not
have
show
his
high
opinion

Mr

more
expressively

<EOS>
but
it
be
Mr

who
save
him

"
   
<EOS>
Helena
's
dark
eye
look
very
earnestly
at
the
bright
face
among
the
leave
,
and
she
ask
,
in
a
slow
and
more
thoughtful
tone
:
   
"
be
Mr
Tartar
with
you
now
,
dear

"

"
no

because
he

It

such
a

be

Rosa
answer
with
a
little
nod
,
and
smell
the
flower

<EOS>
Helena
resume
,
after
a
short
pause
of
silence
,
during
which
she
seem
(
or
it
be
Rosa
's
fancy
)
to
compassionate
somebody
:
 
"
My
poor
Neville
be
read
in
his
own
room
,
the
sun
be
so
very
bright
on
this
side
just
now

I

he
have
well
not

you

so
near

"
   
<EOS>
"
o

I

so
too

very
readily

I
suppose

doubtfully

that
he
must
know
by
-
and

by
all
you
have
tell
me
;
but
I
be
not
sure
.
 
<EOS>
ask
Mr
Crisparkle
's
advice
,
my
darling
.
 
<EOS>
ask
him
whether
I
may
tell
Neville
as
much
or
as
little
of
what
you
have
tell

I
think
best

"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
subside
into
her
state

cabin
,
and
propound
the
question
.
<EOS>
the
Minor
Canon
be
for
the
free
exercise
of
Helena

judgment

<EOS>
"
I
thank
him
very
much

"
say
Helena
,
when
Rosa
emerge
again
with
her
report
.
 
<EOS>
"
ask
him
whether
it
would
be
good
to
wait
until
any
more
maligning
and
pursuing
of
Neville
on
the
part
of
this
wretch
shall
disclose
itself
,
or
to
try
to
anticipate
it
:
 
I
mean
,
so
far
as
to
find
out
whether
any
such
go
on
darkly
about
us
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
Minor
Canon
find
this
point
so
difficult
to
give
a
confident
opinion
on
,
that
,
after
two
or
three
attempt
and
failure
,
he
suggest
a
reference
to
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
Helena
acquiescing
,
he
betake
himself
(
with
a
most
unsuccessful
assumption
of
lounge
indifference
)
across
the
quadrangle
to
P*J*T
's
,
and
state
it
.
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
hold
decidedly
to
the
general
principle
,
that
if
you
could
steal
a
march
upon
a
brigand
or
a
wild
beast
,
you
have
better
do
it
;
and
he
also
hold
decidedly
to
the
special
case
,
that
John
Jasper
be
a
brigand

a
wild
beast
in
combination

<EOS>
thus
advise

Mr

come
back
again

report
to
Rosa

in

turn
report
to
Helena

She
now
steadily
pursue
her
train
of
thought
at
her
window

consider
thereupon

"
We

Mr

she
inquire

o
yes

should

ask
Mr

your

look
back

dip
out
again
with
more
assurance
from
Mr

and
stand
waver
in
a
divided
state
between

him

prove

awkward

"
   
<EOS>
the
Billickin
gracefully
withdraw
with
this
part
speech
,
and
from
that
time
Rosa
occupy
the
restless

of
shuttlecock
between

<EOS>
nothing

<EOS>
thus
,
on
the
daily

arise
question
of
dinner
,
Miss
Twinkleton
would
say
,
the
three
be
present
together
:
   
"
perhaps
,
my
love
,
you
will
consult
with
the
person
of
the
house

whether
she
can
procure
us
a
lamb
's
fry
;
or
,
fail
that
,
a
roast
fowl
.
"
   
<EOS>
on
which
the
Billickin
would
retort
(
Rosa
not
have
speak
a
word
)
,
"
if
you
be
better
accustomed
to
butcher
's
meat
,
Miss
,
you
would
not
entertain
the
idea
of
a
lamb
's
fry
.
 
<EOS>
firstly
,
because
lamb
have
long
be
sheep
,
and
secondly
,
because
there
be
such
thing
as
kill
-
day
,
and
there
be
not
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
roast
fowl
,
Miss
,
why
you
must
be
quite
surfeit
with
roast
fowl
,
let
alone
your
buying
,
when
you
market
for
yourself
,
the
aged
of
poultry
with
the
scaly
of
leg
,
quite
as
if
you
be
accustom
to
pick
'em
out
for
cheapness
.
 
<EOS>
try
a
little
inwention
,
<EOS>
Mississippi
 
use
yourself
to
'
ousekeepe
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
come
now
,
think
of
somethink
else
.
"
   
<EOS>
to
this
encouragement
,
offer
with
the
indulgent
toleration
of
a
wise
and
liberal
expert
,
Miss
Twinkleton
would
rejoin
,
redden
:
   
"
<EOS>
or
,
my
dear
,
you
may
propose
to
the
person
of
the
house
a
duck
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
Miss
!
"
the
Billickin
would
exclaim
(
still
no
word
be
speak
by
Rosa
)
,
"
you
do
surprise
me
when
you
speak
of
duck
!
 
<EOS>
not
to
mention
that
they
be
get
out
of
season
and
very
dear
,
it
really
strike
to
my
heart
to
see
you
have
a
duck
;
for
the
breast
,
which
be
the
only
delicate
cut
in
a
duck
,
always
go
in
a
direction
which
I
can
not
imagine
where
,
and
your
own
plate
come
down
so
miserably
skin
-
and
-
bony
!
 
<EOS>
try
again
,
<EOS>
Mississippi
 
think
more
of
yourself
,
and
less
of
other
.
 
<EOS>
a
dish
of
sweetbread
now
,
or
a
bit
of
mutton
.
 
<EOS>
something
at
which
you
can
get
your
equal
chance
.
"
   
<EOS>
occasionally
the
game
would
wax
very
brisk
indeed
,
and
would
be
keep
up
with
a
smartness
render
such
an
encounter
as
this
quite
tame
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
Billickin
almost
invariably
make
by
far
the
high
score
;
and
would
come
in
with
side
hit
of
the
most
unexpected
and
extraordinary
description
,
when
she
seem
without
a
chance
.
   
<EOS>
all
this
do
not
improve
the
gritty
state
of
thing
in
London
,
or
the
air
that
London
have
acquire
in
Rosa
's
eye
of
wait
for
something
that
never
come
.
 
<EOS>
tired
of
working
,
and
converse
with
Miss
Twinkleton
<EOS>
,
she
suggest
work
and
read
:
 
to
which
Miss
Twinkleton
readily
assent
,
as
an
admirable
reader
,
of
try
power
.
 
<EOS>
but
Rosa
soon
make
the
discovery
that
Miss
Twinkleton
do
not
read
fairly
.
 
<EOS>
She
cut
the
love

scene
,
interpolate
passage
in
praise
of
female
celibacy
,
and
be
guilty
of
other
glare
pious
fraud

<EOS>
as
an
instance
in
point

take
the
glowing
passage
:
 
"

to
the
rich

"
 
<EOS>
Miss
Twinkleton
's
fraudulent
version
tamely
run
thus
:
 
"

<EOS>
as

the

begin
to

the

so

<EOS>
the
pretty

may
have

for
the
accident
of
light
on
some
book
of
voyage

<EOS>
as
a
compensation
against

Miss

read
aloud
,
make
the
most
of
all
the
latitude

bearing

and
other

(
which
she

;
while
Rosa

listen
intently

make
the

<EOS>
the
dawn
again
 
<EOS>
although
Mr

meet
daily
under

cathedral
roof
,
nothing

any

them
have

Edwin

after
the
time

more
than
half

when
Jasper
mutely
show
the
Minor
Canon
the
conclusion
and
the
resolution
enter
in
his
Diary

<EOS>
It
be
not

It

though
so

without
a
sensation
on
the
part
of
each
that
the
other
be
a
perplexing
secret
to
him

<EOS>
jasper
as
the
denouncer
and
pursuer
of
Neville
Landless
,
and
Mr
Crisparkle
as
his
consistent
advocate
and
protector
,
must
at
least
have
stand
sufficiently
in
opposition
to
have
speculate
with
keen
interest
on
the
steadiness
and
next
direction
of
the
other

design

<EOS>
but
neither
ever
broach
the
theme
.
   
<EOS>
false
pretence
not
be
in
the
Minor
Canon

nature
,
he
doubtless
display
openly
that
he
would
at
any
time
have
revive
the
subject
,
and
even
desire
to
discuss
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
determined
reticence
of
Jasper
,
however
,
be
not

be
so
approach
.
 
<EOS>
Impassive
,
moody
,
solitary
,
resolute
,
so
concentrated
on
one
idea
,
and
on
its
attendant
fix
purpose
,
that
he
would
share
it
with
no
fellow
-
creature
<EOS>
,
he
live
apart
from
human
life
.
 
<EOS>
constantly
exercise
an
art
which
bring
him
into
mechanical
harmony
with
other
,
and
which
could
not
have
be
pursue
unless
he
and
they
have
be
in
the
nice
mechanical
relation
and
unison
,
it
be
curious
to
consider
that
the
spirit
of
the
man
be
in
moral
accordance
or
interchange
with
nothing
around
him
.
 
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
indeed
he
have
confide
to
his
lose
nephew
,
before
the
occasion
for
his
present
inflexibility
arise
.
   
<EOS>
that
he
must
know
of
Rosa
's
abrupt
departure
,
and
that
he
must
divine
its
cause
,
be
not
to
be
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
do
he
suppose
that
he
have
terrify
her
into
silence
?
<EOS>
or
do
he
suppose
that
she
have
impart
to
any
one
---
to
Mr
Crisparkle
himself
,
for
instance
---
the
particular
of
his
last
interview
with
her
?
 
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
could
not
determine
this
in
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
but
admit
,
however
,
as
a
just
man
,
that
it
be
not
,
of
itself
,
a
crime
to
fall
in
love
with
Rosa
,
any
more
than
it
be
a
crime
to
offer
to
set
love
above
revenge
.
   
<EOS>
the
dreadful
suspicion
of
Jasper
,
which
Rosa
be
so
shocked
to
have
receive
into
her
imagination
,
appear
to
have
no
harbour
in
Mr
Crisparkle

.
 
<EOS>
if
it
ever
haunt
Helena

Neville

,
neither
give
it
one
spoken
word
of
utterance

<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
take
no
pain
to
conceal
his
implacable
dislike
of
Jasper
,
yet
he
never
refer
it
,
however
distantly
,
to
such
a
source
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
a
reticent
as
well
as
an
eccentric
man
;
and
he
make
no
mention
of
a
certain
evening
when
he
warm
his
hand
at
the
gatehouse
fire
,
and
look
steadily
down
upon
a
certain
heap
of
torn

miry

<EOS>
Drowsy

whenever
it

It

lift
up

to
notice
that
the
bereave
Jasper
be
still
ever
devote
to

then
doze
off

this

set
his

towards

He
travel
thither
by
the
mean
by
which
Rosa
travel
,
and
arrive
,
as

on
a
hot

dusty
evening

<EOS>
His
travel
baggage
be
easily

he
repair
with
it
on
foot

to
a
hybrid
hotel

a
little
square
behind
Aldersgate

near
the

<EOS>
It

It

as
a
novel
enterprise

timidly
begin
to
spring
up
.
 
<EOS>
It
bashfully
,
almost
apologetically
,
give
the
traveller
to
understand
that
it
do
not
expect
him
,
on
the
good
old
constitutional
hotel
plan
,
to
order
a
pint
of
sweet
blacking
for
his
drinking
,
and
throw
it
away
;
but
insinuate
that
he
may
have
his
boot
black
instead
of
his
stomach
,
and
maybe
also
have
bed
,
breakfast
,
attendance
,
and
a
porter
up
all
night
,
for
a
certain
fix
charge
.
 
<EOS>
from
these
and
similar
premise
,
many
true
briton
in
the
low

deduce
that
the

be
level
time
,
except
in
the
article
of
high
road
,
of
which
there
will
shortly
be
not

<EOS>
He
eat
without
appetite
,
and
soon
go
forth
again

<EOS>
eastward
and
still
eastward
through
the
stale
street
he
take
his
way
,
until
he
reach
his
destination
:
 
a
miserable
court
,
specially
miserable
among
many
such

<EOS>
He
ascend
a
broken
staircase
,
open
a

look
into

and
say

<EOS>
I
only
ask
him
the
two
question
,
what
be
his
Chris'en
name
,
and
whether
he
would

not

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Datchery
pause
with
the
select
coin
in
his
hand
,
rather
as
if
he
be
fall
into
a
brown
study
of
their
value
,
and
could
not
bear
to
part
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
woman
look
at
him
distrustfully
,
and
with
her
anger
brewing
for
the
event
of
his
thinking
better
of
the
gift
;
but
he
bestow
it
on
her
as
if
he
be
abstract
his
mind
from
the
sacrifice
,
and
with
many
servile
thank
she
go
her
way
.
   
<EOS>
John
Jasper

lamp
be

his
lighthouse
be
shine
when
Mr

return
alone
towards

<EOS>
as
mariner
on
a
dangerous
voyage

may
look
along
the
beam
of
the
warning
light
to
the
haven
lie
beyond
it
that
may
never

reach
,
so
Mr
Datchery
's
wistful
gaze
be
direct
to
this
beacon
,
and
beyond
.
   
<EOS>
His
object
in
now
revisit
his

be
merely
to
put

superfluous

<EOS>
It
be
half
-
past
ten
by
the
cathedral
clock
when
he
walk
out
into

he
linger

look
about
him
,
as
though
,
the
enchanted
hour
when
Mr

may
be
stone
home
have
strike

he
have
some
expectation
of
see

<EOS>
the
Imp
find
this
a
relish
and
pique
pursuit

firstly
,
because
their
resting

place
be
announce
to

sacred
;
and
secondly
,
because
the
tall
headstone
be
sufficiently
like
themselves
,
on
their
beat
in
the
dark
,
to
justify
the
delicious
fancy
that
they

hurt
when
hit
