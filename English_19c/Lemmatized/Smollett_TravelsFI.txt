<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
You
lay
your
command
upon
me
at
parting
,
to
communicate
from
time
to
time
the
observation
I
should
make
in
the
course
of
my
travel
and
it
be
an
injunction
I
receive
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
in
gratify
your
curiosity
,
I
shall
find
some
amusement
to
beguile
the
tedious
hour
,
which
,
without
some
such
employment
,
would
be
render
insupportable
by
distemper
and
disquiet
.
  
<EOS>
You
know
,
and
pity
my
situation
,
traduce
by
malice
,
persecute
by
faction
,
abandon
by
false
patron
,
and
overwhelm
by
the
sense
of
a
domestic
calamity
,
which
it
be
not
in
the
power
of
fortune
to
repair
.
  
<EOS>
You
know
with
what
eagerness
I
flee
from
my
country
as
a
scene
of
illiberal
dispute
,
and
incredible
infatuation
,
where
a
few
worthless
incendiary
have
,
by
dint
of
perfidious
calumny
and
atrocious
abuse
,
kindle
up
a
flame
which
threaten
all
the
horror
of
civil
dissension
.
  
<EOS>
I
pack
up
my
little
family
in
a
hire
coach
,
and
attend
by
my
trusty
servant
,
who
have
live
with
me
a
dozen
of
year
,
and
now
refuse
to
leave
me
,
take
the
road
to
Dover
,
in
my
way
to
the
South
of
France
,
where
I
hope
the
mildness
of
the
climate
would
prove
favourable
to
the
weak
state
of
my
lung
.
  
<EOS>
You
advise
me
to
have
recourse
again
to
the
Bath
water
,
from
the
use
of
which
I
have
receive
great
benefit
the
precede
winter
:
<EOS>
but
I
have
many
inducement
to
leave
England
.
<EOS>
My
wife
earnestly
beg
I
would
convey
her
from
a
country
where
every
object
serve
to
nourish
her
grief
:
I
be
in
hope
that
a
succession
of
new
scene
would
engage
her
attention
,
and
gradually
call
off
her
mind
from
a
series
of
painful
reflection
;
and
I
imagine
the
change
of
air
,
and
a
journey
of
near
a
thousand
mile
,
would
have
a
happy
effect
upon
my
own
constitution
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
the
summer
be
already
advance
,
and
the
heat
too
excessive
for
travel
in
warm
climate
<EOS>
,
I
propose
stay
at
Boulogne
till
the
beginning
of
autumn
,
and
in
the
mean
time
to
bathe
in
the
sea
,
with
a
view
to
strengthen
and
prepare
my
body
for
the
fatigue
of
such
a
long
journey
.
  
<EOS>
a
man
who
travel
with
a
family
of
five
person
,
must
lay
his
account
with
a
number
of
mortification
;
and
some
of
these
I
have
already
happily
overcome
.
<EOS>
though
I
be
well
acquaint
with
the
road
to
Dover
,
and
make
allowance
accordingly
,
I
could
not
help
be
chagrin
at
the
bad
accommodation
and
impudent
imposition
to
which
I
be
expose
.
<EOS>
these
I
find
the
more
disagreeable
,
as
we
be
detain
a
day
extraordinary
on
the
road
,
in
consequence
of
my
wife
's
be
indispose
.
  
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
you
this
be
the
bad
road
in
England
with
respect
to
the
convenience
of
travelling
,
and
must
certainly
impress
foreigner
with
an
unfavourable
opinion
of
the
nation
in
general
.
<EOS>
the
chamber
be
in
general
cold
and
comfortless
,
the
bed
paultry
,
the
cookery
execrable
,
the
wine
poison
,
the
attendance
bad
,
the
publican
insolent
,
and
the
bill
extortion
;
there
be
not
a
drop
of
tolerable
malt
liquor
to
be
have
from
London
to
Dover
.
  
<EOS>
every
landlord
and
every
waiter
harangue
upon
the
knavery
of
a
publican
in
Canterbury
,
who
have
charge
the
french
ambassador
forty
pound
for
a
supper
that
be
not
worth
forty
shilling
.
<EOS>
They
talk
much
of
honesty
and
conscience
;
but
when
they
produce
their
own
bill
,
they
appear
to
be
all
of
the
same
family
and
complexion
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
a
reproach
upon
the
english
nation
,
that
an
innkeeper
should
pillage
stranger
at
that
rate
;
it
be
a
great
scandal
,
that
the
same
fellow
should
be
able
to
keep
his
house
still
open
.
<EOS>
I
own
,
I
think
it
would
be
for
the
honour
of
the
kingdom
to
reform
the
abuse
of
this
road
;
and
in
particular
to
improve
the
avenue
to
London
by
the
way
of
Kent
-
Street
,
which
be
a
most
disgraceful
entrance
to
such
an
opulent
city
.
<EOS>
a
foreigner
,
in
pass
through
this
beggarly
and
ruinous
suburb
,
conceive
such
an
idea
of
misery
and
meanness
,
as
all
the
wealth
and
magnificence
of
London
and
Westminster
be
afterwards
unable
to
destroy
.
<EOS>
a
friend
of
mine
,
who
bring
a
Parisian
from
Dover
in
his
own
post
-
chaise
,
contrive
to
enter
southwark
after
it
be
dark
,
that
his
friend
may
not
perceive
the
nakedness
of
this
quarter
.
<EOS>
the
stranger
be
much
pleased
with
the
great
number
of
shop
full
of
merchandize
,
light
up
to
the
good
advantage
.
<EOS>
He
be
astonish
at
the
display
of
rich
in
Lombard
-
Street
and
Cheapside
.
<EOS>
the
badness
of
the
pavement
make
him
find
the
street
twice
as
long
as
they
be
.
<EOS>
They
alight
in
Upper
Brook
-
Street
by
Grosvenor
-
Square
;
and
when
his
conductor
tell
him
they
be
then
about
the
middle
of
London
,
the
Frenchman
declare
,
with
mark
of
infinite
surprize
,
that
London
be
very
near
as
long
as
Paris
.
  
<EOS>
on
my
arrival
at
Dover
I
pay
off
my
coachman
,
who
go
away
with
a
heavy
heart
.
<EOS>
He
want
much
to
cross
the
sea
,
and
endeavour
to
persuade
me
to
carry
the
coach
and
horse
to
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
resolve
to
set
out
immediately
for
the
South
,
perhaps
I
should
have
take
his
advice
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
retain
him
at
the
rate
of
twenty
guinea
per
month
,
which
be
the
price
he
demand
,
and
begin
my
journey
without
hesitation
,
I
should
travel
more
agreeably
than
I
can
expect
to
do
in
the
carriage
of
this
 
country
;
and
the
difference
of
the
expence
would
be
a
mere
trifle
.
<EOS>
I
would
advise
every
man
who
travel
through
France
to
bring
his
own
vehicle
along
with
him
,
or
at
least
to
purchase
one
at
Calais
or
Boulogne
,
where
second
-
hand
berlin
and
chaise
may
be
generally
have
at
reasonable
rate
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
offer
a
very
good
berlin
for
thirty
guinea
:
<EOS>
but
before
I
make
the
purchase
,
I
must
be
better
inform
touch
the
different
method
of
travel
in
this
country
.
  
<EOS>
Dover
be
commonly
term
a
den
of
thief
;
and
I
be
afraid
it
be
not
altogether
without
reason
,
it
have
acquire
this
appellation
.
<EOS>
the
people
be
say
to
live
by
piracy
in
time
of
war
;
and
by
smuggle
and
fleece
stranger
in
time
of
peace
:
but
I
will
do
them
the
justice
to
say
,
they
make
no
distinction
between
foreigner
and
native
.
<EOS>
without
all
doubt
a
man
can
not
be
much
bad
lodge
and
bad
treat
in
any
part
of
Europe
;
nor
will
he
in
any
other
place
meet
with
more
flagrant
instance
of
fraud
,
imposition
,
and
brutality
.
<EOS>
one
would
imagine
they
have
form
a
general
conspiracy
against
all
those
who
either
go
to
,
or
return
from
the
continent
.
<EOS>
about
five
year
ago
,
in
my
passage
from
flush
to
Dover
,
the
master
of
the
packet
-
boat
bring
-
to
all
of
a
sudden
off
the
South
Foreland
,
although
the
wind
be
as
favourable
as
it
could
blow
.
<EOS>
He
be
immediately
board
by
a
customhouse
boat
,
the
officer
of
which
appear
to
be
his
friend
.
<EOS>
He
then
give
the
passenger
to
understand
,
that
as
it
be
low
water
,
the
ship
could
not
go
into
the
harbour
;
but
that
the
boat
would
carry
them
ashore
with
their
baggage
.
  
<EOS>
the
custom
-
house
officer
demand
a
guinea
for
this
service
,
and
the
bargain
be
make
.
<EOS>
before
we
quit
the
ship
,
we
be
oblige
to
gratify
the
cabin
-
boy
for
his
attendance
,
and
to
give
drink
-
money
to
the
sailor
.
<EOS>
the
boat
be
run
aground
on
the
open
beach
;
but
we
could
not
get
ashore
without
the
assistance
of
three
or
four
fellow
,
who
insist
upon
be
pay
for
their
trouble
.
<EOS>
every
parcel
and
bundle
,
as
it
be
land
,
be
snatch
up
by
a
separate
porter
:
<EOS>
one
run
away
with
a
hat
-
box
,
another
with
a
wig
-
box
,
a
third
with
a
couple
of
shirt
tie
up
in
a
handkerchief
,
and
two
be
employ
in
carry
a
small
portmanteau
that
do
not
weigh
forty
pound
.
<EOS>
all
our
thing
be
hurry
to
the
custom
-
house
to
be
search
,
and
the
searcher
be
pay
for
disorder
our
cloath
:
from
thence
they
be
remove
to
the
inn
,
where
the
porter
demand
half
-
a
-
crown
each
for
their
labour
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
to
expostulate
;
they
surround
the
house
like
a
pack
of
hungry
bound
,
and
raise
such
a
clamour
,
that
we
be
fain
to
comply
.
<EOS>
after
we
have
undergo
all
this
imposition
,
we
be
visit
by
the
master
of
the
packet
,
who
,
have
take
our
fare
,
and
wish
us
joy
of
our
happy
arrival
in
England
,
express
his
hope
that
we
would
remember
the
poor
master
,
whose
wage
be
very
small
,
and
who
chiefly
depend
upon
the
generosity
of
the
passenger
.
<EOS>
I
own
I
be
shock
at
his
meanness
,
and
could
not
help
tell
him
so
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
I
could
not
conceive
what
title
he
have
to
any
such
gratification
<EOS>
:
he
have
sixteen
passenger
,
who
pay
a
guinea
each
,
on
the
supposition
that
every
person
should
have
a
bed
;
but
there
be
no
more
than
eight
bed
in
the
cabin
,
and
each
of
these
be
occupy
before
I
come
on
board
;
so
that
if
we
have
be
detain
at
sea
a
whole
week
by
contrary
wind
and
bad
weather
,
one
half
of
the
passenger
must
have
sleep
upon
the
board
,
howsoever
their
health
may
have
suffer
from
this
want
of
accommodation
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
check
,
he
be
so
very
abject
and
importunate
,
that
we
give
him
a
crown
a
-
piece
,
and
he
retire
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
thing
I
do
when
I
arrive
at
Dover
this
last
time
,
be
to
send
for
the
master
of
a
packet
-
boat
,
and
agree
with
him
to
carry
us
to
Boulogne
at
once
,
by
which
mean
I
save
the
expence
of
travel
by
land
from
Calais
to
this
last
place
,
a
journey
of
four
-
and
-
twenty
mile
.
<EOS>
the
hire
of
a
vessel
from
Dover
to
Boulogne
be
precisely
the
same
as
from
Dover
to
Calais
,
five
guinea
;
but
this
skipper
demand
eight
,
and
,
as
I
do
not
know
the
fare
,
I
agree
to
give
him
six
.
<EOS>
We
embark
between
six
and
seven
in
the
evening
,
and
find
ourselves
in
a
most
wretched
hovel
,
on
board
what
be
call
a
Folkstone
cutter
.
<EOS>
the
cabin
be
so
small
that
a
dog
could
hardly
turn
in
it
,
and
the
bed
put
me
in
mind
of
the
hole
describe
in
some
catacomb
,
in
which
the
body
of
the
dead
be
deposit
,
be
thrust
in
with
the
foot
foremost
;
there
be
no
get
into
them
but
end
-
way
,
and
indeed
they
seem
so
dirty
,
that
nothing
but
extreme
necessity
could
have
oblige
me
to
use
them
.
<EOS>
We
sit
up
all
night
in
a
most
uncomfortable
situation
,
toss
about
by
the
sea
,
cold
,
arid
cramp
and
weary
,
and
languish
for
want
of
sleep
.
<EOS>
at
three
in
the
morning
the
master
come
down
,
and
tell
us
we
be
just
off
the
harbour
of
Boulogne
;
but
the
wind
blow
off
shore
,
he
could
not
possibly
enter
,
and
therefore
advise
us
to
go
ashore
in
the
boat
.
<EOS>
I
go
upon
deck
to
view
the
coast
,
when
he
point
to
the
place
where
he
say
Boulogne
stand
,
declare
at
the
same
time
we
be
within
a
short
mile
of
the
harbour
's
mouth
.
<EOS>
the
morning
be
cold
and
raw
,
and
I
know
myself
extremely
subject
to
catch
cold
;
nevertheless
we
be
all
so
impatient
to
be
ashore
,
that
I
resolve
to
take
his
advice
.
<EOS>
the
boat
be
already
hoist
out
,
and
we
go
on
board
of
it
,
after
I
have
pay
the
captain
and
gratify
his
crew
.
<EOS>
We
have
scarce
part
from
the
ship
,
when
we
perceive
a
boat
come
towards
us
from
the
shore
;
and
the
master
give
us
to
understand
,
it
be
come
to
carry
us
into
the
harbour
.
<EOS>
when
I
object
to
the
trouble
of
shift
from
one
boat
to
another
in
the
open
sea
,
which
(
by
the
bye
)
be
a
little
rough
;
he
say
it
be
a
privilege
which
the
waterman
of
Boulogne
have
,
to
carry
all
passenger
ashore
,
and
that
this
privilege
he
durst
not
venture
to
infringe
.
<EOS>
this
be
no
time
nor
place
to
remonstrate
.
<EOS>
the
french
boat
come
alongside
half
fill
with
water
,
and
we
be
hand
from
the
one
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
We
be
then
oblige
to
lie
upon
our
oar
,
till
the
captain
's
boat
go
on
board
and
return
from
the
ship
with
a
packet
of
letter
.
<EOS>
We
be
afterwards
row
a
long
league
,
in
a
rough
sea
,
against
wind
and
tide
,
before
we
reach
the
harbour
,
where
we
land
,
benumb
with
cold
,
and
the
woman
excessively
sick
:
from
our
landing
-
place
we
be
oblige
to
walk
very
near
a
mile
to
the
inn
where
we
purpose
to
lodge
,
attend
by
six
or
seven
man
and
woman
,
bare
-
legged
,
carry
our
baggage
.
<EOS>
this
boat
cost
me
a
guinea
,
besides
pay
exorbitantly
the
people
who
carry
our
thing
;
so
that
the
inhabitant
of
Dover
and
of
Boulogne
seem
to
be
of
the
same
kidney
,
and
indeed
they
understand
one
another
perfectly
well
.
<EOS>
It
be
our
honest
captain
who
make
the
signal
for
the
shore
-
boat
before
I
go
upon
deck
;
by
which
mean
he
not
only
gratify
his
friend
,
the
waterman
of
Boulogne
,
but
also
save
about
fifteen
shilling
portage
,
which
he
must
have
pay
<EOS>
have
he
go
into
the
harbour
;
and
thus
he
find
himself
at
liberty
to
return
to
Dover
,
which
he
reach
in
four
hour
.
<EOS>
I
mention
these
circumstance
as
a
warning
to
other
passenger
.
<EOS>
when
a
man
hire
a
packet
-
boat
from
Dover
to
Calais
or
Boulogne
,
let
him
remember
that
the
state
price
be
five
guinea
;
and
let
him
insist
upon
be
carry
into
the
harbour
in
the
ship
,
without
pay
the
least
regard
to
the
representation
of
the
master
,
who
be
generally
a
little
dirty
knave
.
<EOS>
when
he
tell
you
it
be
low
water
,
or
the
wind
be
in
your
tooth
,
you
may
say
you
will
stay
on
board
till
it
be
high
water
,
or
till
the
wind
come
favourable
.
<EOS>
if
he
see
you
be
resolute
,
he
will
find
mean
to
bring
his
ship
into
the
harbour
,
or
at
least
to
convince
you
,
without
a
possibility
of
your
be
deceive
,
that
it
be
not
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
the
fellow
himself
be
a
loser
by
his
finesse
;
if
he
have
go
into
the
harbour
,
he
would
have
have
another
fare
immediately
back
to
Dover
,
for
there
be
a
Scotch
gentleman
at
the
inn
wait
for
such
an
opportunity
.
  
<EOS>
know
my
own
weak
constitution
,
I
take
it
for
grant
this
morning
's
adventure
<EOS>
would
cost
me
a
fit
of
illness
;
and
what
add
to
my
chagrin
,
when
we
arrive
at
the
inn
,
all
the
bed
be
occupy
;
so
that
we
be
oblige
to
sit
in
a
cold
kitchen
above
two
hour
,
until
some
of
the
lodger
should
get
up
.
<EOS>
this
be
such
a
bad
speciman
of
french
accommodation
,
that
my
wife
could
not
help
regret
even
the
inn
of
Rochester
,
Sittingbourn
,
and
canterbury
:
bad
as
they
be
,
they
certainly
have
the
advantage
,
when
compare
with
the
execrable
auberge
of
this
country
,
where
one
find
nothing
but
dirt
and
imposition
.
<EOS>
one
would
imagine
the
French
be
still
at
war
with
the
English
,
for
they
pillage
them
without
mercy
.
  
<EOS>
among
the
stranger
at
this
inn
where
we
lodge
,
there
be
a
gentleman
of
the
faculty
,
just
return
from
Italy
.
<EOS>
understand
that
I
intend
to
winter
in
the
South
of
France
,
on
account
of
a
pulmonic
disorder
,
he
strongly
recommend
the
climate
of
Nice
in
Provence
,
which
,
indeed
,
I
have
often
hear
extoll
;
and
I
be
almost
resolve
to
go
thither
,
not
only
for
the
sake
of
the
air
,
but
also
for
its
situation
on
the
Mediterranean
,
where
I
can
have
the
benefit
of
bathing
;
and
from
whence
there
be
a
short
cut
by
sea
to
Italy
,
should
I
find
it
necessary
to
try
the
air
of
Naples
.
  
<EOS>
after
have
be
ill
accommodate
three
day
at
our
inn
,
we
have
at
last
find
commodious
lodging
,
by
mean
of
Mrs
B-
,
a
very
agreeable
french
lady
,
to
whom
we
be
recommend
by
her
husband
,
who
be
my
countryman
,
and
at
present
resident
in
London
.
<EOS>
for
three
guinea
a
month
we
have
the
great
part
of
a
house
tolerably
furnish
;
four
bed
-
chamber
on
the
first
floor
,
a
large
parlour
below
,
a
kitchen
,
and
the
use
of
a
cellar
.
  
<EOS>
these
,
I
own
,
be
frivolous
incident
,
scarce
worth
commit
to
paper
;
but
they
may
serve
to
introduce
observation
of
more
consequence
;
and
in
the
mean
time
I
know
nothing
will
be
indifferent
to
you
,
that
concern
 
Your
humble

<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
the
custom
-
house
officer
at
Boulogne
,
though
as
alert
,
be
rather
more
civil
than
those
on
your
side
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
I
bring
no
plate
along
with
me
,
but
a
dozen
and
a
half
of
spoon
,
and
a
dozen
teaspoon
<EOS>
:
the
first
being
find
in
one
of
our
portmanteaus
,
when
they
be
examine
at
the
bureau
,
cost
me
seventeen
livre
entree
;
the
other
be
luckily
in
my
servant
's
pocket
,
escape
duty
free
.
<EOS>
all
work
silver
import
into
France
,
pay
at
the
rate
of
so
much
per
mark
:
therefore
those
who
have
any
quantity
of
plate
,
will
do
well
to
leave
it
behind
them
,
unless
they
can
confide
in
the
dexterity
of
the
shipmaster
;
some
of
whom
will
undertake
to
land
it
without
the
ceremony
of
examination
.
<EOS>
the
ordonnance
of
France
be
so
unfavourable
to
stranger
,
that
they
oblige
them
to
pay
at
the
rate
of
five
per
cent
.
<EOS>
for
all
the
bed
and
table
linen
which
they
bring
into
the
kingdom
,
even
though
it
have
be
use
.
<EOS>
when
my
trunk
arrive
in
a
ship
from
the
river
Thames
,
I
undergo
this
ordeal
:
but
what
give
me
more
vexation
,
my
book
have
be
stop
at
the
bureau
;
and
will
be
send
to
Amiens
at
my
expence
,
to
be
examine
by
the
chambre
syndicale
;
lest
they
should
contain
something
prejudicial
to
the
state
,
or
to
the
religion
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
species
of
oppression
which
one
would
not
expect
to
meet
with
in
France
,
which
pique
itself
on
its
politeness
and
hospitality
:
but
the
truth
be
,
I
know
no
country
in
which
stranger
be
worse
treat
with
respect
to
their
essential
concern
.
<EOS>
if
a
foreigner
die
in
France
,
the
king
seize
all
his
effect
,
even
though
his
heir
should
be
upon
the
spot
;
and
this
tyranny
be
call
the
droit
d'aubaine
found
at
first
upon
the
supposition
,
that
all
the
estate
of
foreigner
reside
in
France
be
acquire
in
that
kingdom
,
and
that
,
therefore
,
it
would
be
unjust
to
convey
it
to
another
country
.
<EOS>
if
an
english
protestant
go
to
France
for
the
benefit
of
his
health
,
attend
by
his
wife
or
his
son
,
or
both
,
and
die
with
effect
in
the
house
to
the
amount
of
a
thousand
guinea
,
the
king
seize
the
whole
,
the
family
be
leave
destitute
,
and
the
body
of
the
deceased
be
deny
christian
burial
.
<EOS>
the
Swiss
,
by
capitulation
,
be
exempt
from
this
despotism
,
and
so
be
the
Scots
,
in
consequence
of
an
ancient
alliance
between
the
two
nation
.
<EOS>
the
same
droit
d'aubaine
be
exact
by
some
of
the
prince
in
Germany
:
but
it
be
a
great
discouragement
to
commerce
,
and
prejudice
every
country
where
it
be
exercise
,
to
ten
time
the
value
of
what
it
bring
into
the
coffer
of
the
sovereign
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
exceedingly
mortify
at
the
detention
of
my
book
,
which
not
only
deprive
me
of
an
amusement
which
I
can
very
ill
dispense
with
;
but
,
in
all
probability
,
will
expose
me
to
sundry
other
inconveniencie
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
at
the
expence
of
send
them
sixty
mile
to
be
examine
,
and
run
the
risque
of
their
be
condemn
;
and
,
in
the
mean
time
,
I
may
lose
the
opportunity
of
send
them
with
my
heavy
baggage
by
sea
to
Bourdeaux
,
to
be
send
up
the
Garonne
to
Tholouse
,
and
from
thence
transmit
through
the
canal
of
Languedoc
to
Cette
,
which
be
a
sea
-
port
on
the
Mediterranean
,
about
three
or
four
league
from
Montpelier
.
  
<EOS>
for
the
recovery
of
my
book
,
I
have
recourse
to
the
advice
of
my
landlord
,
Mons
B
 
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
handsome
young
fellow
,
about
twenty
-
five
year
of
age
,
and
keep
house
with
two
maiden
sister
,
who
be
profess
devotee
.
<EOS>
the
brother
be
a
little
libertine
,
good
natured
and
obliging
;
but
a
true
Frenchman
in
vanity
,
which
be
undoubtedly
the
rule
passion
of
this
volatile
people
.
<EOS>
He
have
an
inconsiderable
place
under
the
government
,
in
consequence
of
which
he
be
permit
to
wear
a
sword
,
a
privilege
which
he
do
not
fail
to
use
.
<EOS>
He
be
likewise
receiver
of
the
tythe
of
the
clergy
in
this
district
,
an
office
that
give
him
a
command
of
money
,
and
he
,
moreover
,
deal
in
the
wine
trade
.
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
his
house
,
he
make
a
parade
of
all
these
advantage
:
he
display
his
bag
of
money
,
and
some
old
gold
which
his
father
have
leave
him
.
<EOS>
He
describe
his
chateau
in
the
country
;
drop
hint
of
the
fortune
that
be
settle
upon
mademoiselle
his
sister
;
boast
of
his
connexion
at
court
;
and
assure
me
it
be
not
for
my
money
that
he
let
his
lodging
,
but
altogether
with
a
view
to
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
my
company
.
<EOS>
the
truth
,
when
stript
of
all
embellishment
,
be
this
:
<EOS>
the
sieur
B
  
be
the
son
of
an
honest
bourgeois
lately
dead
,
who
leave
him
the
house
,
with
some
stock
in
trade
,
a
little
money
,
and
a
paltry
farm
:
his
sister
have
about
three
thousand
livre
(
not
quite
140
l
)
apiece
;
the
brother
's
place
be
worth
about
fifty
pound
a
year
,
and
his
connexion
at
court
be
confine
to
a
commis
or
clerk
in
the
secretary
's
office
,
with
whom
he
correspond
by
virtue
of
his
employment
.
<EOS>
My
landlord
pique
himself
upon
his
gallantry
and
success
with
the
fair
-
sex
:
<EOS>
he
keep
a
fille
de
joye
,
and
make
no
secret
of
his
amour
.
<EOS>
He
tell
miss
C
  
<EOS>
the
other
day
,
in
break
English
,
that
,
in
the
course
of
the
last
year
,
he
have
make
six
bastard
.
<EOS>
He
own
,
at
the
same
time
,
he
have
send
them
all
to
the
hospital
;
but
,
now
his
father
be
dead
,
he
would
himself
take
care
of
his
future
production
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
no
well
than
a
gasconade
.
<EOS>
yesterday
the
house
be
in
a
hot
alarm
,
on
account
of
a
new
windfall
of
this
kind
:
the
sister
be
in
tear
;
the
brother
be
visit
by
the
cure
of
the
parish
;
the
lady
in
the
straw
(
a
sempstress
)
send
him
the
bantling
in
a
basket
,
and
he
transmit
it
by
the
carrier
to
the
Enfans
trouve
at
Paris
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
from
this
digression
:
<EOS>
Mr
B
  
advise
me
to
send
a
requete
or
petition
to
the
chancellor
of
France
,
that
I
may
obtain
an
order
to
have
my
book
examine
on
the
spot
,
by
the
president
of
Boulogne
,
or
the
procureur
du
roy
,
or
the
sub
-
delegate
of
the
intendance
.
<EOS>
He
recommend
an
advocat
of
his
acquaintance
to
draw
up
the
memoire
,
and
introduce
him
accordingly
;
tell
me
at
the
same
time
,
in
private
,
that
if
he
be
not
a
drunkard
,
he
would
be
at
the
head
of
his
profession
.
<EOS>
He
have
indeed
all
the
outward
sign
of
a
sot
;
a
sleepy
eye
,
a
rubicund
face
,
and
carbuncle
nose
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
be
a
little
out
at
elbow
,
have
marvellous
foul
linen
,
and
his
breech
be
not
very
sound
:
but
he
assume
an
air
of
importance
,
be
very
courteous
,
and
very
solemn
.
<EOS>
I
ask
him
if
he
do
not
sometimes
divert
himself
with
the
muse
:
he
smile
,
and
promise
,
in
a
whisper
,
to
shew
me
some
chansonette
de
sa
facon
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
he
compose
the
requete
in
my
name
,
which
be
very
pompous
,
very
tedious
,
and
very
abject
.
<EOS>
such
a
stile
may
perhaps
be
necessary
in
a
native
of
France
;
but
I
do
not
think
it
be
at
all
suitable
to
a
subject
of
Great
-
Britain
.
<EOS>
I
thank
him
for
the
trouble
he
have
take
,
as
he
would
receive
no
other
gratification
;
but
when
my
landlord
propose
to
send
the
memoire
to
his
correspondent
at
Paris
,
to
be
deliver
to
the
chancellor
,
I
tell
him
I
have
change
my
mind
,
and
would
apply
to
the
english
ambassador
.
<EOS>
I
have
accordingly
take
the
liberty
to
address
myself
to
the
earl
of
h
 
;
and
at
the
same
time
I
have
presume
to
write
to
the
duchess
of
D
 
,
who
be
now
at
Paris
,
to
entreat
her
grace
's
advice
and
interposition
.
<EOS>
what
effect
these
application
may
have
,
I
know
not
:
but
<EOS>
the
sieur
B
  
shake
his
head
,
and
have
tell
my
servant
,
in
confidence
,
that
I
be
mistaken
if
I
think
the
english
ambassador
be
as
great
a
man
at
Paris
as
the
chancellor
of
France
.
  
<EOS>
I
ought
to
make
an
apology
for
trouble
you
with
such
an
unentertaine
detail
,
and
consider
that
the
detention
of
my
book
must
be
a
matter
of
very
little
consequence
to
any
body
,
but
to
 
Your
affectionate
humble
servant
.

SIR
 
<EOS>
I
be
much
oblige
to
you
for
your
kind
enquiry
after
my
health
,
which
have
be
lately
in
a
very
declining
condition
.
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
a
cold
,
catch
a
few
day
after
my
arrival
in
France
,
I
be
seize
with
a
violent
cough
,
attend
with
a
fever
,
and
stitch
in
my
breast
,
which
torment
me
all
night
long
without
cease
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
I
have
a
great
discharge
by
expectoration
,
and
such
a
dejection
of
spirit
as
I
never
feel
before
.
<EOS>
in
this
situation
I
take
a
step
which
may
appear
to
have
be
desperate
.
<EOS>
I
know
there
be
no
imposthume
in
my
lung
,
and
I
suppose
the
stitch
be
spasmodical
.
<EOS>
I
be
sensible
that
all
my
complaint
be
originally
derive
from
relaxation
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
hire
a
chaise
,
and
go
to
the
beach
,
about
a
league
from
the
town
,
plunge
into
the
sea
without
hesitation
.
<EOS>
by
this
desperate
remedy
,
I
get
a
fresh
cold
in
my
head
:
but
my
stitch
and
fever
vanish
the
very
first
day
;
and
by
a
daily
repetition
of
the
bath
,
I
have
diminish
my
cough
,
strengthen
my
body
,
and
recover
my
spirit
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
should
have
try
the
same
experiment
,
even
if
there
have
be
an
abscess
in
my
lung
,
though
such
practice
would
have
be
contrary
to
all
the
rule
of
medicine
:
but
I
be
not
one
of
those
who
implicitly
believe
in
all
the
dogmata
of
physic
.
<EOS>
I
see
one
of
the
guide
at
Bath
,
the
stout
fellow
among
them
,
who
recover
from
the
last
stage
of
a
consumption
,
by
go
into
the
king
's
bath
,
contrary
to
the
express
injunction
of
his
doctor
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
if
he
must
die
,
the
sooner
the
well
,
as
he
have
nothing
leave
for
his
subsistence
.
<EOS>
instead
of
immediate
death
,
he
find
instant
case
,
and
continue
mend
every
day
,
till
his
health
be
entirely
re
-
establish
.
<EOS>
I
myself
drink
the
water
of
Bath
,
and
bathe
,
in
diametrical
opposition
to
the
opinion
of
some
physician
there
settle
,
and
find
myself
well
every
day
,
notwithstanding
their
unfavourable
prognostic
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
of
the
rigid
fibre
,
full
of
blood
,
subject
to
inflammation
,
I
should
have
follow
a
different
course
.
<EOS>
Our
acquaintance
,
doctor
C
 
,
while
he
actually
spit
up
matter
,
and
ride
out
every
day
for
his
life
,
lead
his
horse
to
water
,
at
the
pond
in
Hyde
-
Park
,
one
cold
frosty
morning
,
and
the
beast
,
which
happen
to
be
of
a
hot
constitution
,
plunge
himself
and
his
master
over
head
and
ear
in
the
water
.
<EOS>
the
poor
doctor
hasten
home
,
half
dead
with
fear
,
and
be
put
to
bed
in
the
apprehension
of
a
new
imposthume
;
instead
of
which
,
he
find
himself
exceedingly
recruit
in
his
spirit
,
and
his
appetite
much
mend
.
<EOS>
I
advise
him
to
take
the
hint
,
and
go
into
the
cold
bath
every
morning
;
but
he
do
not
chuse
to
run
any
risque
.
<EOS>
how
cold
water
come
to
be
such
a
bugbear
,
I
know
not
:
if
I
be
not
mistaken
,
Hippocrates
recommend
immersion
in
cold
water
for
the
gout
;
and
Celsus
expressly
say
,
in
omni
tussi
utilis
est
natatio
:
in
every
cough
swimming
be
of
service
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
converse
with
a
physician
of
this
place
,
a
sensible
man
,
who
assure
me
he
be
reduce
to
meer
skin
and
bone
by
a
cough
and
hectic
fever
,
when
he
order
a
bath
to
be
make
in
his
own
house
,
and
dip
himself
in
cold
water
every
morning
.
<EOS>
He
at
the
same
time
leave
off
drink
and
swallow
any
liquid
that
be
warm
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
strong
and
lusty
,
and
even
in
winter
have
no
other
cover
than
a
single
sheet
.
<EOS>
His
notion
about
the
warm
drink
be
a
little
whimsical
:
he
imagine
it
relax
the
tone
of
the
stomach
;
and
this
would
undoubtedly
be
the
case
if
it
be
drink
in
large
quantity
,
warm
than
the
natural
temperature
of
the
blood
.
<EOS>
He
alledge
the
example
of
the
inhabitant
of
the
Ladrone
island
,
who
never
taste
any
thing
that
be
not
cold
,
and
be
remarkably
healthy
.
<EOS>
but
to
balance
this
argument
I
mention
the
Chinese
,
who
scarce
drink
any
thing
but
warm
tea
;
and
the
Laplanders
,
who
drink
nothing
but
warm
water
;
yet
the
people
of
both
these
nation
be
remarkably
strong
,
healthy
,
and
long
-
lived
.
  
<EOS>
You
desire
to
know
the
fate
of
my
book
.
<EOS>
My

and
his

with
that
generous

which
be
peculiar

<EOS>
I
have
meet
with
another
piece
of
good
fortune
,
in
be
introduce
to
general
Paterson
and
his
lady
,
in
their
way
to
England
from
Nice
,
where
the
general
have
be
many
year
commandant
for
the
king
of
Sardinia
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
hear
of
this
gentleman
,
who
have
not
only
eminently
distinguish
himself
,
by
his
courage
and
conduct
as
an
officer
;
but
also
by
his
probity
and
humanity
in
the
exercise
,
of
his
office
,
and
by
his
remarkable
hospitality
to
all
stranger
,
especially
the
subject
of
Great

Britain
,
whose
occasion
call
them
to
the
place
where
he
command
.
<EOS>
be
pretty
far
advanced
in
year
,
he
beg
leave
to
resign
,
that
he
may
spend
the
evening
of
his
day
in
his
own
country
;
and
his
sardinian
majesty
grant
his
request
with
regret
,
after
have
honour
him
with
very
particular
mark
of
approbation
and
esteem
.
<EOS>
the
general
talk
so
favourably
of
the
climate
of
Nice
,
with
respect
to
disorder
of
the
breast
,
that
I
be
now
determined
to
go
thither
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
happy
for
me
<EOS>
have
he
continue
in
his
government
.
<EOS>
I
think
myself
still
very
fortunate
,
in
have
obtain
of
him
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
the
english
consul
at
Nice
,
together
with
direction
how
to
travel
through
the
South
of
France
.
<EOS>
I
propose
to
begin
my
journey
some
time
next
month
,
when
the
weather
will
be
temperate
to
the
southward
;
and
in
the
wine
country
I
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
see
the
vintage
,
which
be
always
a
season
of
festivity
among
all
rank
of
people
.
  
<EOS>
You
have
be
very
much
mis
-
inform
,
by
the
person
who
compare
Boulogne
to
wapping
:
he
do
a
manifest
injustice
to
this
place
which
be
a
large
agreeable
town
,
with
broad
open
street
,
excellently
pave
;
and
the
house
be
of
stone
,
well
build
and
commodious
.
<EOS>
the
number
of
inhabitant
may
amount
to
sixteen
thousand
.
<EOS>
You
know
this
be
generally
suppose
to
be
the
portus
Itius
,
and
Gessoriacum
of
the
antient
:
though
it
be
now
believe
that
the
portus
Itius
,
from
whence
Caesar
sail
to
Britain
,
be
a
place
call
Whitsand
,
about
half
way
between
this
place
and
Calais
.
<EOS>
Boulogne
be
the
capital
of
the
Boulonnois
,
a
district
extend
about
twelve
league
,
rule
by
a
governor
independent
of
the
governor
of
Picardy
;
of
which
province
,
however
,
this
country
form
a
part
.
<EOS>
the
present
governor
be
the
duc
d'Aumout
.
<EOS>
the
town
of
Boulogne
be
the
see
of
a
bishop
suffragan
of
Rheims
,
whose
revenue
amount
to
about
four
-
and
-
twenty
thousand
livre
,
or
one
thousand
pound
sterling
.
<EOS>
It
be
also
the
seat
of
a
seneschal
's
court
,
from
whence
an
appeal
lie
to
the
parliament
of
Paris
;
and
thither
all
condemn
criminal
be
send
,
to
have
their
sentence
confirm
or
reverse
.
<EOS>
here
be
likewise
a
bailiwick
,
and
a
court
of
admiralty
.
<EOS>
the
military
jurisdiction
of
the
city
belong
to
a
commandant
appoint
by
the
king
,
a
sort
of
sinecure
bestow
upon
some
old
officer
.
<EOS>
His
appointment
be
very
inconsiderable
:
he
reside
in
the
Upper
Town
,
and
his
garrison
at
present
consist
of
a
few
hundred
of
invalid
.
  
<EOS>
Boulogne
be
divide
into
the
Upper
and
Lower
town
.
<EOS>
the
former
be
a
kind
of
citadel
,
about
a
short
mile
in
circumference
,
situate
on
a
rise
ground
,
surround
by
a
high
wall
and
rampart
,
plant
with
row
of
tree
,
which
form
a
delightful
walk
.
<EOS>
It
command
a
fine
view
of
the
country
and
Lower
Town
;
and
in
clear
weather
the
coast
of
England
,
from
Dover
to
Folkstone
,
appear
so
plain
,
that
one
would
imagine
it
be
within
four
or
five
league
of
the
french
shore
.
<EOS>
the
Upper
Town
be
formerly
fortify
with
outwork
,
which
be
now
in
ruin
.
<EOS>
here
be
a
square
,
a
town
-
house
,
the
cathedral
,
and
two
or
three
convent
of
nun
;
in
one
of
which
there
be
several
english
girl
,
send
hither
for
their
education
.
<EOS>
the
smallness
of
the
expence
encourage
parent
to
send
their
child
abroad
to
these
seminary
,
where
they
learn
scarce
any
thing
that
be
useful
but
the
french
language
;
but
they
never
fail
to
imbibe
prejudice
against
the
protestant
religion
,
and
generally
return
enthusiastic
convert
to
the
religion
of
Rome
.
<EOS>
this
conversion
always
generate
a
contempt
for
,
and
often
an
aversion
to
,
their
own
country
.
<EOS>
indeed
it
can
not
reasonably
be
expect
that
people
of
weak
mind
,
addict
to
superstition
,
should
either
love
or
esteem
those
whom
they
be
teach
to
consider
as
reprobate
heretic
.
<EOS>
ten
pound
a
year
be
the
usual
pension
in
these
convent
;
but
I
have
be
inform
by
a
french
lady
who
have
her
education
in
one
of
them
,
that
nothing
can
be
more
wretched
than
their
entertainment
.
  
<EOS>
the
civil
magistracy
of
Boulogne
consist
of
a
mayor
and
echevin
;
and
this
be
the
case
in
almost
all
the
town
of
France
.
  
<EOS>
the
Lower
Town
be
continue
from
the
gate
of
the
Upper
Town
,
down
the
slope
of
a
hill
,
as
far
as
the
harbour
,
stretch
on
both
side
to
a
large
extent
,
and
be
much
more
considerable
than
the
Upper
,
with
respect
to
the
beauty
of
the
street
,
the
convenience
of
the
house
,
and
the
number
and
wealth
of
the
inhabitant
.
<EOS>
these
,
however
,
be
all
merchant
,
or
bourgeoise
,
for
the
noblesse
or
gentry
live
all
together
in
the
Upper
Town
,
and
never
mix
with
the
other
.
<EOS>
the
harbour
of
Boulogne
be
at
the
mouth
of
the
small
river
,
or
rather
rivulet
Liane
,
which
be
so
shallow
,
that
the
child
wade
through
it
at
low
water
.
<EOS>
as
the
tide
make
,
the
sea
flow
in
,
and
form
a
pretty
extensive
harbour
,
which
,
however
,
admit
nothing
but
small
vessel
.
<EOS>
It
be
contract
at
the
mouth
by
two
stone
jetty
or
pier
,
which
seem
to
have
be
construct
by
some
engineer
,
very
little
acquaint
with
this
branch
of
his
profession
;
for
they
be
carry
out
in
such
a
manner
,
as
to
collect
a
bank
of
sand
just
at
the
entrance
of
the
harbour
.
<EOS>
the
road
be
very
open
and
unsafe
,
and
the
surf
very
high
when
the
wind
blow
from
the
sea
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
fortification
near
the
harbour
,
except
a
paltry
fort
mount
about
twenty
gun
,
build
in
the
last
war
by
the
prince
de
Cruy
,
upon
a
rock
about
a
league
to
the
eastward
of
Boulogne
.
<EOS>
It
appear
to
be
situate
in
such
a
manner
,
that
it
can
neither
offend
,
nor
be
offend
.
<EOS>
if
the
depth
of
water
would
admit
a
forty
or
fifty
gun
ship
to
lie
within
cannon
-
shot
of
it
,
I
apprehend
it
may
be
silence
in
half
an
hour
;
but
,
in
all
probability
,
there
will
be
no
vestige
of
it
at
the
next
rupture
between
the
two
crown
.
<EOS>
It
be
surround
every
day
by
the
sea
,
at
high
water
;
and
when
it
blow
a
fresh
gale
towards
the
shore
,
the
wave
break
over
the
top
of
it
,
to
the
terror
and
astonishment
of
the
garrison
,
who
have
be
often
hear
cry
piteously
for
assistance
.
<EOS>
I
be
persuade
,
that
it
will
one
day
disappear
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
.
<EOS>
the
neighbourhood
of
this
fort
,
which
be
a
smooth
sandy
beach
,
I
have
choose
for
my
bathing
place
.
<EOS>
the
road
to
it
be
agreeable
and
romantic
,
lie
through
pleasant
cornfield
,
skirt
by
open
down
,
where
there
be
a
rabbit
warren
,
and
great
plenty
of
the
bird
so
much
admire
at
Tunbridge
under
the
name
of
wheat
-
ear
.
<EOS>
by
the
bye
,
this
be
a
pleasant
corruption
of
white
-
a
-
se
,
the
translation
of
their
french
name
cul
-
blanc
,
take
from
their
colour
for
they
be
actually
white
towards
the
tail
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
top
of
a
high
rock
,
which
overlook
the
harbour
,
be
the
remain
of
an
old
fortification
,
which
be
indiscriminately
call
,
Tour
d'ordre
,
and
Julius
Caesar
's
fort
.
<EOS>
the
original
tower
be
a
light
-
house
build
by
Claudius
Caesar
,
denominate
Turris
arden
,
from
the
fire
burn
in
it
;
and
this
the
French
have
corrupt
into
Tour
d'ordre
;
but
no
vestige
of
this
roman
work
remain
;
what
we
now
see
,
be
the
ruin
of
a
castle
build
by
Charlemagne
.
<EOS>
I
know
of
no
other
antiquity
at
Boulogne
,
except
an
old
vault
in
the
Upper
Town
,
now
use
as
a
magazine
,
which
be
say
to
be
part
of
an
antient
temple
dedicate
to
Isis
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
other
side
of
the
harbour
,
opposite
to
the
Lower
Town
,
there
be
a
house
build
,
at
a
considerable
expence
,
by
a
general
officer
,
who
lose
his
life
in
the
late
war
.
<EOS>
never
be
situation
more
inconvenient
,
unpleasant
,
and
unhealthy
.
<EOS>
It
stand
on
the
edge
of
an
ugly
morass
form
by
the
stagnant
water
leave
by
the
tide
in
its
retreat
:
the
very
walk
of
the
garden
be
so
moist
,
that
,
in
the
dry
weather
,
no
person
can
make
a
tour
of
it
,
without
danger
of
the
rheumatism
.
<EOS>
besides
,
the
house
be
altogether
inaccessible
,
except
at
low
water
,
and
even
then
the
carriage
must
cross
the
harbour
,
the
wheel
up
to
the
axle
-
tree
in
mud
:
<EOS>
nay
,
the
tide
rush
in
so
fast
,
that
unless
you
seize
the
time
to
a
minute
,
you
will
be
in
danger
of
perish
.
<EOS>
the
apartment
of
this
house
be
elegantly
fit
up
,
but
very
small
;
and
the
garden
,
notwithstanding
its
unfavourable
situation
,
afford
a
great
quantity
of
good
fruit
.
<EOS>
the
ooze
,
impregnate
with
sea
salt
,
produce
,
on
this
side
of
the
harbour
,
an
incredible
quantity
of
the
fine
samphire
I
ever
see
.
<EOS>
the
french
call
it
passe
-
pierre
;
and
I
suspect
its
english
name
be
a
corruption
of
sang
-
pierre
.
<EOS>
It
be
generally
find
on
the
face
of
bare
rock
that
overhang
the
sea
,
by
the
spray
of
which
it
be
nourish
.
<EOS>
as
it
grow
upon
a
naked
rock
,
without
any
appearance
of
soil
,
it
may
be
naturally
enough
call
sang
du
pierre
,
or
sangpierre
,
blood
of
the
rock
;
and
hence
the
name
samphire
.
<EOS>
on
the
same
side
of
the
harbour
there
be
another
new
house
,
neatly
build
,
belong
to
a
gentleman
who
have
obtain
a
grant
from
the
king
of
some
ground
which
be
always
overflow
at
high
water
.
<EOS>
He
have
raise
dyke
at
a
considerable
expence
,
to
exclude
the
tide
,
and
if
he
can
bring
his
project
to
bear
,
he
will
not
only
gain
a
good
estate
for
himself
,
but
also
improve
the
harbour
,
by
increase
the
depth
at
high
-
water
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
Lower
Town
of
Boulogne
there
be
several
religious
house
,
particularly
a
seminary

a
convent
of
Cordeliers
,
and
another
of
capuchin

<EOS>
this
last

have
fall
to
decay
,
be
some
year
ago
repair
,
chiefly
by
the
charity
of
british
traveller
,
collect
by
father
Graeme
,
a
native
of
North

Britain
,
who
have
be
an
officer

army
of
king
James

way
of
voluntary
penance
,
for
have
kill
his
friend
in
a
duel
.
<EOS>
be
that
as
it
may
,
he
be
a
well
-
breed
,
sensible
man
,
of
a
very
exemplary
life
and
conversation
;
and
his
memory
be
much
revere
in
this
place
.
<EOS>
be
superior
of
the
convent
,
he
cause
the
british
arm
to
be
put
up
in
the
church
,
as
a
mark
of
gratitude
for
the
benefaction
receive
from
our
nation
.
<EOS>
I
often
walk
in
the
garden
of
the
convent
,
the
wall
of
which
be
wash
by
the
sea
at
high
-
water
.
<EOS>
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
be
a
little
private
grove
,
separate
from
it
by
a
high
wall
,
with
a
door
of
communication
;
and
hither
the
Capuchins
retire
,
when
they
be
dispose
for
contemplation
.
<EOS>
about
two
year
ago
,
this
place
be
say
to
be
convert
to
a
very
different
use
.
<EOS>
there
be
among
the
monk
one
pere
Charles
,
a
lusty
friar
,
of
whom
the
people
tell
strange
story
.
<EOS>
some
young
woman
of
the
town
be
see
mount
over
the
wall
,
by
a
ladder
of
rope
,
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
;
and
there
be
an
unusual
crop
of
bastard
that
season
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
pere
Charles
and
his
companion
give
such
scandal
,
that
the
whole
fraternity
be
change
;
and
now
the
nest
be
occupy
by
another
flight
of
these
bird
of
passage
.
<EOS>
if
one
of
our
privateer
have
kidnap
a
Capuchin
during
the
war
,
and
exhibit
him
,
in
his
habit
,
as
a
shew
in
London
,
he
would
have
prove
a
good
prize
to
the
captor
;
for
I
know
not
a
more
uncouth
and
grotesque
animal
,
than
an
old
Capuchin
in
the
habit
of
his
order
.
<EOS>
a
friend
of
mine
(
a
swiss
officer
)
tell
me
,
that
a
peasant
in
his
country
use
to
weep
bitterly
,
whenever
a
certain
Capuchin
mount
the
pulpit
to
hold
forth
to
the
people
.
<EOS>
the
good
father
take
notice
of
this
man
,
and
believe
he
be
touch
by
the
finger
of
the
Lord
.
<EOS>
He
exhort
him
to
encourage
these
accession
of
grace
,
and
at
the
same
time
to
be
of
good
comfort
,
as
have
receive
such
mark
of
the
divine
favour
.
<EOS>
the
man
still
continue
to
weep
,
as
before
,
every
time
the
monk
preach
;
and
at
last
the
Capuchin
insist
upon
know
what
it
be
,
in
his
discourse
or
appearance
,
that
make
such
an
impression
upon
his
heart
"
ah
,
father
!
<EOS>
(
cry
the
peasant
)
<EOS>
I
never
see
you
<EOS>
but
I
think
of
a
venerable
goat
,
which
I
lose
at
Easter
.
<EOS>
We
be
breed
up
together
in
the
same
family
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
very
picture
of
your
reverence
 
one
would
swear
you
be
brother
.
<EOS>
poor
Baudouin
!
<EOS>
he
die
of
a
fall
 
rest
his
soul
!
<EOS>
I
would
willingly
pay
for
a
couple
of
masse
to
pray
him
out
of
purgatory
.
"
  
<EOS>
among
other
public
edifice
at
Boulogne
,
there
be
an
hospital
,
or
workhouse
,
which
seem
to
be
establish
upon
a
very
good
foundation
.
<EOS>
It
maintain
several
hundred
of
poor
people
,
who
be
keep
constantly
at
work
,
accord
to
their
age
and
ability
,
in

,
all
sort
of
lace
,
a
kind
of
catgut
,
and
in

<EOS>
It
be
under
the
direction
of
the
bishop
;
and
the
see
be
at
present
fill
by
a
prelate
of
great
piety
and
benevolence
,
though
a
little
inclining
to
bigotry
and
fanaticism
.
<EOS>
the
church
in
this
town
be
but
indifferently
build
,
and
poorly
ornament
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
one
picture

do
there

SIR
,
 
I
be
infinitely
oblige
to
D
h
  
for
the
favourable
manner
in
which
he
have
mention
me
to
the
earl
of

<EOS>
I
have
at
last
recover
my
book
,
by
virtue
of
a
particular
order
to
the
director
of
the
douane
,
procure
by
the
application
of
the
english
resident
to
the
french
ministry
.
<EOS>
I
be
now
prepare
for
my
long
journey
;
but
,
before
I
leave
this
place
,
I
shall
send
you
the
packet
I
mention
,
by
Meriton
.
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
-
while
I
must
fulfil
my
promise
in
communicate
the
observation
I
have
have
occasion
to
make
upon
this
town
and
country
.
  
<EOS>
the
air
of
Boulogne
be
cold
and
moist
,
and
,
I
believe
,
of
consequence
unhealthy
.
<EOS>
last
winter
the
frost
,
which
continue
six
week
in
London
,
last
here
eight
week
without
intermission
;
and
the
cold
be
so
intense
,
that
,
in
the
garden
of
the
Capuchins
,
it
split
the
bark
of
several
elm
from
top
to
bottom
.
<EOS>
on
our
arrival
here
we
find
all
kind
of
fruit
more
backward
than
in
England
.
<EOS>
the
frost
,
in
its
progress
to
Britain
,
be
much
weaken
in
cross
the
sea
.
<EOS>
the
atmosphere
,
impregnate
with
saline
particle
,
resist
the
operation
of
freeze
.
<EOS>
hence
,
in
severe
winter
,
all
place
near
the
sea
-
side
be
less
cold
than
more
inland
district
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
reason
why
the
winter
be
often
more
mild
at
Edinburgh
than
at
London
.
<EOS>
a
very
great
degree
of
cold
be
require
to
freeze
salt
water
.
<EOS>
indeed
it
will
not
freeze
at
all
,
until
it
have
deposit
all
its
salt
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
generally
allow
among
philosopher
,
that
water
be
no
more
than
ice
thaw
by
heat
,
either
solar
,
or
subterranean
,
or
both
;
and
that
this
heat
be
expel
,
it
would
return
to
its
natural
consistence
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
case
,
nothing
else
be
require
for
the
freezing
of
water
,
than
a
certain
degree
of
cold
,
which
may
be
generate
by
the
help
of
salt
,
or
spirit
of
nitre
,
even
under
the
line
.
<EOS>
I
would
propose
,
therefore
,
that
an
apparatus
of
this
sort
should
be
provide
in
every
ship
that
go
to
sea
;
and
in
case
there
should
be
a
deficiency
of
fresh
water
on
board
,
the
seawater
may
be
render
potable
,
by
be
first
convert
into
ice
.
  
<EOS>
the
air
of
Boulogne
be
not
only
load
with
a
great
evaporation
from
the
sea
,
increase
by
strong
gale
of
wind
from
the
West
and
South
-
West
,
which
blow
almost
continually
during
the
great
part
of
the
year
;
but
it
be
also
subject
to
putrid
vapour
,
arise
from
the
low
marshy
ground
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
harbour
,
which
be
every
tide
overflow
with
seawater
.
<EOS>
this
may
be
one
cause
of
the
scrofula
and
ricket
,
which
be
two
prevail
disorder
among
the
child
in
Boulogne
.
<EOS>
but
I
believe
the
former
be
more
owing
to
the
water
use
in
the
Lower
Town
,
which
be
very
hard
and
unwholsome
.
<EOS>
It
curdle
with
soap
,
give
a
red
colour
to
the
meat
that
be
boil
in
it
,
and
,
when
drink
by
stranger
,
never
fail
to
occasion
pain
in
the
stomach
and
bowel
;
nay
,
sometimes
produce
dysentery
.
<EOS>
in
all
appearance
it
be
impregnate
with
nitre
,
if
not
with
something
more
mischievous
:
we
know
that
mundic
,
or
pyrite
,
very
often
contain
a
proportion
of
arsenic
,
mixed
with
sulphur
,
vitriol
,
and
mercury
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
partake
of
the
acid
of
some
coal
mine
;
for
there
be
coal
work
in
this
district
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
well
of
purge
water
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
Upper
Town
,
to
which
the
inhabitant
resort
in
the
morning
,
as
the
people
of
London
go
to
the
Dog
-
and
-
duck
,
in
St
George
's
field
.
<EOS>
there
be
likewise
a
fountain
of
excellent
water
,
hard
by
the
cathedral
,
in
the
Upper
Town
,
from
whence
I
be
daily
supply
at
a
small
expence
.
<EOS>
some
modern
chemist
affirm
,
that
no
saline
chalybeate
water
can
exist
,
except
in
the
neighbourhood
of
coal
damp
;
and
that
nothing
can
be
more
mild
,
and
gentle
,
and
friendly
to
the
constitution
,
than
the
say
damp
:
<EOS>
but
I
know
that
the
place
where
I
be
breed
stand
upon
a
zonic
of
coal
;
that
the
water
which
the
inhabitant
generally
use
be
hard
and
brackish
;
and
that
the
people
be
remarkably
subject
to
the
king
's
evil
and
consumption
.
<EOS>
these
I
would
impute
to
the
bad
water
,
impregnate
with
the
vitriol
and
brine
of
coal
,
as
there
be
nothing
in
the
constitution
of
the
air
that
should
render
such
distemper
endemial
.
<EOS>
that
the
air
of
Boulogne
encourage
putrefaction
,
appear
from
the
effect
it
have
upon
butcher
's
meat
,
which
,
though
the
season
be
remarkably
cold
,
we
can
hardly
keep
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
in
the
cool
part
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
live
here
be
pretty
reasonable
;
and
the
market
be
tolerably
supply
.
<EOS>
the
beef
be
neither
fat
nor
firm
;
but
very
good
for
soup
,
which
be
the
only
use
the
french
make
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
veal
be
not
so
white
,
nor
so
well
fed
,
as
the
english
veal
;
but
it
be
more
juicy
,
and
better
taste
.
<EOS>
the
mutton
and
pork
be
very
good
.
<EOS>
We
buy
our
poultry
alive
,
and
fatten
them
at
home
.
<EOS>
here
be
excellent
turkie
,
and
no
want
of
game
:
the
hare
,
in
particular
,
be
very
large
,
juicy
,
and
high
-
flavour
.
<EOS>
the
good
part
of
the
fish
catch
on
this
coast
be
send
post
to
Paris
,
in
chasse
-
marines
,
by
a
company
of
contractor
,
like
those
of
Hastings
in
Sussex
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
we
have
excellent
sol
,
skaite
,
flounder
and
whiting
,
and
sometimes
mackarel
.
<EOS>
the
oyster
be
very
large
,
coarse
,
and
rank
.
<EOS>
there
be
very
little
fish
catch
on
the
french
coast
,
because
the
shallow
run
a
great
way
from
the
shore
;
and
the
fish
live
chiefly
in
deep
water
:
for
this
reason
the
fisherman
go
a
great
way
out
to
sea
,
sometimes
even
as
far
as
the
coast
of
England
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
the
haste
the
contractor
can
make
,
their
fish
in
the
summer
be
very
often
spoil
before
it
arrive
at
Paris
;
and
this
be
not
to
be
wonder
at
,
consider
the
length
of
the
way
,
which
be
near
one
hundred
and
fifty
mile
.
<EOS>
at
best
it
must
be
in
such
a
mortified
condition
,
that
no
other
people
,
except
the
negro
on
the
coast
of
Guinea
,
would
feed
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
wine
commonly
drink
at
Boulogne
come
from
Auxerre
,
be
very
small
and
meagre
,
and
may
be
have
from
five
to
eight
sol
a
bottle
;
that
is
,
from
two
-
pence
halfpenny
to
fourpence
.
<EOS>
the
french
inhabitant
drink
no
good
wine
;
nor
be
there
any
to
be
have
,
unless
you
have
recourse
to
the
british
wine
-
merchant
here
establish
,
who
deal
in
Bourdeaux
wine
,
bring
hither
by
sea
for
the
London
market
.
<EOS>
I
have
very
good
claret
from
a
friend
,
at
the
rate
of
fifteen
-
pence
sterling
a
bottle
;
and
excellent
small
beer
as
reasonable
as
in
England
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
there
be
a
drop
of
generous
Burgundy
in
the
place
;
and
the
aubergistes
impose
upon
us
shamefully
,
when
they
charge
it
at
two
livre
a
bottle
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
small
white
wine
,
call
preniac
,
which
be
very
agreeable
and
very
cheap
.
<EOS>
all
the
brandy
which
I
have
see
in
Boulogne
be
new
,
fiery
,
and
still
-
burn
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
trash
which
the
smuggler
import
into
England
:
they
have
it
for
about
ten
-
pence
a
gallon
.
<EOS>
Butcher
's
meat
be
sell
for
five
sol
,
or
two
-
pence
halfpenny
a
pound
,
and
the
pound
here
consist
of
eighteen
ounce
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
young
turkey
for
thirty
sol
;
a
hare
for
four
-
and
-
twenty
;
a
couple
of
chicken
for
twenty
sol
,
and
a
couple
of
good
sol
for
the
same
price
.
<EOS>
before
we
leave
England
,
we
be
tell
that
there
be
no
fruit
in
Boulogne
;
but
we
have
find
ourselves
agreeably
disappointed
in
this
particular
.
<EOS>
the
place
be
well
supply
with
strawberry
,
cherry
,
gooseberry
,
corinth
,
peach
,
apricot
,
and
excellent
pear
.
<EOS>
I
have
eat
more
fruit
this
season
,
than
I
have
do
for
several
year
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
well
-
cultivate
garden
in
the
skirt
of
the
town
;
particularly
one
belong
to
our
friend
Mrs
B
 
,
where
we
often
drink
tea
in
a
charming
summer
-
house
build
on
a
rise
ground
,
which
command
a
delightful
prospect
of
the
sea
.
<EOS>
We
have
many
obligation
to
this
good
lady
,
who
be
a
kind
neighbour
,
an
obliging
friend
,
and
a
most
agreeable
companion
:
she
speak
English
prettily
,
and
be
greatly
attach
to
the
people
and
the
custom
of
our
nation
.
<EOS>
They
use
wood
for
their
common
fewel
,
though
,
if
I
be
to
live
at
Boulogne
,
I
would
mix
it
with
coal
,
which
this
country
afford
.
<EOS>
both
the
wood
and
the
coal
be
reasonable
enough
.
<EOS>
I
be
certain
that
a
man
may
keep
house
in
Boulogne
for
about
one
half
of
what
it
will
cost
him
in
London
;
and
this
be
say
to
be
one
of
the
dear
place
in
France
.
  
<EOS>
the
adjacent
country
be
very
agreeable
,
diversify
with
hill
and
dale
,
corn
-
field
,
wood
,
and
meadow
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
forest
of
a
considerable
extent
,
that
begin
about
a
short
league
from
the
Upper
Town
:
it
belong
to
the
king
,
and
the
wood
be
farm
to
different
individual
.
  
<EOS>
in
point
of
agriculture
,
the
people
in
this
neighbourhood
seem
to
have
profit
by
the
example
of
the
English
.
<EOS>
since
I
be
last
in
France
,
fifteen
year
ago
,
a
good
number
of
inclosure
and
plantation
have
be
make
in
the
english
fashion
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
good
many
tolerable
country
-
house
,
within
a
few
mile
of
Boulogne
;
but
mostly
empty
.
<EOS>
I
be
offer
a
compleat
house
,
with
a
garden
of
four
acre
well
lay
out
,
and
two
field
for
grass
or
hay
,
about
a
mile
from
the
town
,
for
four
hundred
livre
,
about
seventeen
pound
a
year
:
it
be
partly
furnish
,
stand
in
an
agreeable
situation
,
with
a
fine
prospect
of
the
sea
,
and
be
lately
occupy
by
a
Scotch
nobleman
,
who
be
in
the
service
of
France
.
  
<EOS>
to
judge
from
appearance
,
the
people
of
Boulogne
be
descend
from
the
Flemings
,
who
formerly
possess
this
country
;
for
,
a
great
many
of
the
present
inhabitant
have
fine
skin
,
fair
hair
,
and
florid
complexion
;
very
different
from
the
native
of
France
in
general
,
who
be
distinguish
by
black
hair
,
brown
skin
,
and
swarthy
face
.
<EOS>
the
people
of
the
Boulonnois
enjoy
some
extraordinary
privilege
,
and
,
in
particular
,
be
exempt
from
the
gabelle
or
duty
upon
salt
:
<EOS>
how
they
deserve
this
mark
of
favour
,
I
do
not
know
;
but
they
seem
to
have
a
spirit
of
independence
among
them
,
be
very
ferocious
,
and
much
addict
to
revenge
.
<EOS>
many
barbarous
murder
be
commit
,
both
in
the
town
and
country
;
and
the
peasant
,
from
motive
of
envy
and
resentment
,
frequently
set
their
neighbour
'
house
on
fire
.
<EOS>
several
instance
of
this
kind
have
happen
in
the
course
of
the
last
year
.
<EOS>
the
interruption
which
be
give
,
in
arbitrary
government
,
to
the
administration
of
justice
,
by
the
interposition
of
the
great
,
have
always
a
bad
effect
upon
the
moral
of
the
common
people
.
<EOS>
the
peasant
too
be
often
render
desperate
and
savage
,
by
the
misery
they
suffer
from
the
oppression
and
tyranny
of
their
landlord
.
<EOS>
in
this
neighbourhood
the
labour
people
be
ill
lodged
and
wretchedly
feed
;
and
they
have
no
idea
of
cleanliness
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
substantial
burgher
in
the
High
Town
,
who
be
some
year
ago
convict
of
a
most
barbarous
murder
.
<EOS>
He
receive
sentence
to
be
break
alive
upon
the
wheel
;
but
be
pardon
by
the
interposition
of
the
governor
of
the
county
,
and
carry
on
his
business
as
usual
in
the
face
of
the
whole
community
.
<EOS>
a
furious
abbe
,
be
refuse
order
by
the
bishop
,
on
account
of
his
irregular
life
,
take
an
opportunity
to
stab
the
prelate
with
a
knife
,
one
Sunday
,
as
he
walk
out
of
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
the
good
bishop
desire
he
may
be
permit
to
escape
;
but
it
be
think
proper
to
punish
,
with
the
utmost
severity
,
such
an
atrocious
attempt
.
<EOS>
He
be
accordingly
apprehend
,
and
,
though
the
wound
be
not
mortal
,
condemn
to
be
break
.
<EOS>
when
this
dreadful
sentence
be
execute
,
he
cry
out
,
that
it
be
hard
he
should
undergo
such
torment
,
for
have
wound
a
worthless
priest
,
by
whom
he
have
be
injure
,
while
such
-
a
-
one
(
name
the
burgher
mention
above
)
live
in
ease
and
security
,
after
have
brutally
murder
a
poor
man
,
and
a
helpless
woman
big
with
child
,
who
have
not
give
him
the
least
provocation
.
  
<EOS>
the
inhabitant
of
Boulogne
may
be
divide
into
three
class
;
the
noblesse
or
gentry
,
the
burgher
,
and
the
canaille
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mention
the
clergy
,
and
the
people
belong
to
the
law
,
because
I
shall
occasionally
trouble
you
with
my
thought
upon
the
religion
and
ecclesiastic
of
this
country
;
and
as
for
the
lawyer
,
exclusive
of
their
profession
,
they
may
be
consider
as
belong
to
one
or
other
of
these
division
.
<EOS>
the
noblesse
be
vain
,
proud
,
poor
,
and
slothful
.
<EOS>
very
few
of
them
have
above
six
thousand
livre
a
year
,
which
may
amount
to
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
pound
sterling
;
and
many
of
them
have
not
half
this
revenue
.
<EOS>
I
think
there
be
one
heiress
,
say
to
be
worth
one
hundred
thousand
livre
,
about
four
thousand
two
hundred
pound
;
but
then
her
jewel
,
her
cloath
,
and
even
her
linen
,
be
reckon
part
of
this
fortune
.
<EOS>
the
noblesse
have
not
the
common
sense
to
reside
at
their
house
in
the
country
,
where
,
by
farm
their
own
ground
,
they
may
live
at
a
small
expence
,
and
improve
their
estate
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
They
allow
their
country
house
to
go
to
decay
,
and
their
garden
and
field
to
waste
;
and
reside
in
dark
hole
in
the
Upper
Town
of
Boulogne
without
light
,
air
,
or
convenience
.
<EOS>
there
they
starve
within
door
,
that
they
may
have
wherewithal
to
purchase
fine
cloath
,
and
appear
dress
once
a
day
in
the
church
,
or
on
the
rampart
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
education
,
no
taste
for
reading
,
no
housewifery
,
nor
indeed
any
earthly
occupation
,
but
that
of
dress
their
hair
,
and
adorn
their
body
.
<EOS>
They
hate
walk
,
and
would
never
go
abroad
,
if
they
be
not
stimulate
by
the
vanity
of
be
see
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
except
indeed
those
who
turn
devotee
,
and
spend
the
great
part
of
their
time
with
the
priest
,
either
at
church
or
in
their
own
house
.
<EOS>
other
amusement
they
have
none
in
this
place
,
except
private
party
of
card
-
playing
,
which
be
far
from
be
expensive
.
<EOS>
nothing
can
be
more
parsimonious
than
the
oeconomy
of
these
people
:
they
live
upon
soupe
and
bouille
,
fish
and
sallad
:
they
never
think
of
give
dinner
,
or
entertain
their
friend
;
they
even
save
the
expence
of
coffee
and
tea
,
though
both
be
very
cheap
at
Boulogne
.
<EOS>
They
presume
that
every
person
drink
coffee
at
home
,
immediately
after
dinner
,
which
be
always
over
by
one
o'clock
;
and
,
in
lieu
of
tea
in
the
afternoon
,
they
treat
with
a
glass
of
sherbet
,
or
capillaire
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
I
know
not
a
more
insignificant
set
of
mortal
than
the
noblesse
of
Boulogne
;
helpless
in
themselves
,
and
useless
to
the
community
;
without
dignity
,
sense
,
or
sentiment
;
contemptible
from
pride
.
<EOS>
and
ridiculous
from
vanity
.
<EOS>
They
pretend
to
be
jealous
of
their
rank
,
and
will
entertain
no
correspondence
with
the
merchant
,
whom
they
term
plebeian
.
<EOS>
They
likewise
keep
at
a
great
distance
from
stranger
,
on
pretence
of
a
delicacy
in
the
article
of
punctilio
:
but
,
as
I
be
inform
,
this
stateliness
be
in
a
great
measure
affect
,
in
order
to
conceal
their
poverty
,
which
would
appear
to
great
disadvantage
,
if
they
admit
of
a
more
familiar
communication
.
<EOS>
consider
the
vivacity
of
the
french
people
,
one
would
imagine
they
could
not
possibly
lead
such
an
insipid
life
,
altogether
unanimated
by
society
,
or
diversion
.
<EOS>
true
it
be
,
the
only
profane
diversion
of
this
place
be
a
puppet
-
show
and
a
mountebank
;
but
then
their
religion
afford
a
perpetual
comedy
.
<EOS>
Their
high
masse
,
their
feast
,
their
procession
,
their
pilgrimage
,
confession
,
image
,
taper
,
robe
,
incense
,
benediction
,
spectacle
,
representation
,
and
innumerable
ceremony
,
which
revolve
almost
incessantly
,
furnish
a
variety
of
entertainment
from
one
end
of
the
year
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
if
superstition
imply
fear
,
never
be
a
word
more
misapplied
than
it
be
to
the
mummery
of
the
religion
of
Rome
.
<EOS>
the
people
be
so
far
from
be
impressed
with
awe
and
religious
terror
by
this
sort
of
machinery
,
that
it
amuse
their
imagination
in
the
most
agreeable
manner
,
and
keep
them
always
in
good
humour
.
<EOS>
a
roman
catholic
long
as
impatiently
for
the
festival
of
St
Suaire
,
or
St
Croix
,
or
St
Veronique
,
as
a
schoolboy
in
England
for
the
representation
of
punch
and
the
devil
;
and
there
be
generally
as
much
laugh
at
one
farce
as
at
the
other
.
<EOS>
even
when
the
descent
from
the
cross
be
act
,
in
the
holy
week
,
with
all
the
circumstance
that
ought
naturally
to
inspire
the
grave
sentiment
,
if
you
cast
your
eye
among
the
multitude
that
croud
the
place
,
you
will
not
discover
one
melancholy
face
:
all
be
prattle
,
titter
,
or
laughing
;
and
ten
to
one
<EOS>
but
you
perceive
a
number
of
them
employ
in
hiss
the
female
who
personate
the
Virgin
Mary
.
<EOS>
and
here
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
observe
,
that
the
roman
catholics
,
not
content
with
the
infinite
number
of
saint
who
really
exist
,
have
not
only
personify
the
cross
,
but
make
two
female
saint
out
of
a
piece
of
linen
.
<EOS>
veronique
,
or
Veronica
,
be
no
other
than
a
corruption
of
vera
icon
,
or
vera
effigy
,
say
to
be
the
exact
representation
of
our
Saviour
's
face
,
impress
upon
a
piece
of
linen
,
with
which
he
wipe
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
in
his
way
to
the
place
of
crucifixion
.
<EOS>
the
same
be
worship
under
the
name
of
St
Suaire
,
from
the
latin
word
sudarium
.
<EOS>
this
same
handkerchief
be
say
to
have
have
three
fold
,
on
every
one
of
which
be
the
impression
:
one
of
these
remain
at
Jerusalem
,
a
second
be
bring
to
Rome
,
and
a
third
be
convey
to
Spain
.
<EOS>
Baronius
say
,
there
be
a
very
antient
history
of
the
sancta
facie
in
the
Vatican
.
<EOS>
Tillemont
,
however
,
look
upon
the
whole
as
a
fable
.
<EOS>
some
suppose
Veronica
to
be
the
same
with
St
Haemorrhoissa
,
the
patroness
of
those
who
be
afflict
with
the
pile
,
who
make
their
joint
invocation
to
her
and
St
Fiacre
,
the
son
of
a
Scotch
king
,
who
live
and
die
a
hermit
in
France
.
<EOS>
the
troop
of
Henry
V
of
England
be
say
to
have
pillage
the
chapel
of
this
Highland
saint
;
who
,
in
revenge
,
assist
his
countryman
,
in
the
french
service
,
to
defeat
the
English
at
Bauge
,
and
afterwards
afflict
Henry
with
the
pile
,
of
which
he
die
.
<EOS>
this
prince
complain
,
that
he
be
not
only
plague
by
the
live
Scots
,
but
even
persecute
by
those
who
be
dead
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
I
may
be
allow
to
compare
the
romish
religion
to
comedy
,
and
calvinism
to
tragedy
.
<EOS>
the
first
amuse
the
sense
,
and
excite
idea
of
mirth
and
good
-
humour
;
the
other
,
like
tragedy
,
deal
in
the
passion
of
terror
and
pity
.
<EOS>
step
into
a
conventicle
of
dissenter
,
you
will
,
ten
to
one
,
hear
the
minister
hold
forth
upon
the
suffering
of
Christ
,
or
the
torment
of
hell
,
and
see
many
mark
of
religious
horror
in
the
face
of
the
hearer
.
<EOS>
this
be
perhaps
one
reason
why
the
reformation
do
not
succeed
in
France
,
among
a
volatile
,
giddy
,
unthinke
people
,
shock
at
the
mortify
appearance
of
the
Calvinists
;
and
account
for
its
rapid
progress
among
nation
of
a
more
melancholy
turn
of
character
and
complexion
:
for
,
in
the
conversion
of
the
multitude
,
reason
be
generally
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
even
the
penance
impose
upon
the
catholics
be
little
more
than
mock
mortification
:
a
murderer
be
often
quit
with
his
confessor
for
say
three
prayer
extraordinary
;
and
these
easy
term
,
on
which
absolution
be
obtain
,
certainly
encourage
the
repetition
of
the
most
enormous
crime
.
<EOS>
the
pomp
and
ceremony
of
this
religion
,
together
with
the
great
number
of
holiday
they
observe
,
howsoever
<EOS>
they
may
keep
up
the
spirit
of
the
commonalty
,
and
help
to
diminish
the
sense
of
their
own
misery
,
must
certainly
,
at
the
same
time
,
produce
a
frivolous
taste
for
frippery
and
shew
,
and
encourage
a
habit
of
idleness
,
to
which
I
,
in
a
great
measure
,
ascribe
the
extreme
poverty
of
the
low
people
.
<EOS>
very
near
half
of
their
time
,
which
may
he
profitably
employ
in
the
exercise
of
industry
,
be
lose
to
themselves
and
the
community
,
in
attendance
upon
the
different
exhibition
of
religious
mummery
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
this

have
already
run
to
an
unconscionable
length

I
shall
defer

till
another

DEAR
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
My
stay
in
this
place
now
draw
towards
a
period
.
 
<EOS>
'
till
within
these
few
day
I
have
continue
bathe
,
with
some
advantage
to
my
health
,
though
the
season
have
be
cold
and
wet
,
and
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
fine
prospect
of
a
plentiful
harvest
in
this
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
I
use
to
have
great
pleasure
in
drive
between
the
field
of
wheat
,
oats
,
and
barley
;
but
the
crop
have
be
entirely
ruin
by
the
rain
,
and
nothing
be
now
to
be
see
on
the
ground
but
the
tarnished
straw
,
and
the
rotten
spoil
of
the
husbandman
's
labour
.
<EOS>
the
ground
scarce
afford
subsistence
to
a
few
flock
of
meagre
sheep
,
that
crop
the
stubble
,
and
the
intervene
grass
;
each
flock
under
the
protection
of
its
shepherd
,
with
his
crook
and
dog
,
who
lie
every
night
in
the
midst
of
the
fold
,
in
a
little
thatched
travel
lodge
,
mount
on
a
wheel
-
carriage
.
<EOS>
here
he
pass
the
night
,
in
order
to
defend
his
flock
from
the
wolf
,
which
be
sometimes
,
especially
in
winter
,
very
bold
and
desperate
.
  
<EOS>
two
day
ago
we
make
an
excursion
with
Mrs
B
  
and
Capt
L
  
to
the
village
of
Samers
,
on
the
Paris
road
,
about
three
league
from
Boulogne
.
<EOS>
here
be
a
venerable
abbey
of
Benedictines
,
well
endowed
,
with
large
agreeable
garden
prettily
lay
out
.
<EOS>
the
monk
be
well
lodged
,
and
well
entertain
.
<EOS>
tho
'
restrict
from
flesh
meal
by
the
rule
of
their
order
,
they
be
allow
to
eat
wild
duck
and
teal
,
as
a
species
of
fish
;
and
when
they
long
for
a
good
bouillon
,
or
a
partridge
,
or
pullet
,
they
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
say
they
be
out
of
order
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
the
appetite
of
the
patient
be
indulge
in
his
own
apartment
.
<EOS>
Their
church
be
elegantly
contrive
,
but
keep
in
a
very
dirty
condition
.
<EOS>
the
great
curiosity
I
see
in
this
place
be
an
english
boy
,
about
eight
or
nine
year
old
,
whom
his
father
have
send
hither
to
learn
the
french
language
.
<EOS>
in
less
than
eight
week
,
he
be
become
captain
of
the
boy
of
the
place
,
speak
French
perfectly
well
,
and
have
almost
forget
his
mother
tongue
.
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
the
people
of
Boulogne
.
  
<EOS>
the
burgher
here
,
as
in
other
place
,
consist
of
merchant
,
shop
-
keeper
,
and
artisan
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
merchant
have
get
fortune
,
by
fit
out
privateer
during
the
war
.
<EOS>
a
great
many
single
ship
be
take
from
the
English
,
notwithstanding
the
good
look
-
out
of
our
cruiser
,
who
be
so
alert
,
that
the
privateer
from
this
coast
be
often
take
in
four
hour
after
they
sail
from
the
french
harbour
;
and
there
be
hardly
a
captain
of
an
armateur
in
Boulogne
,
who
have
not
be
prisoner
in
England
five
or
six
time
in
the
course
of
the
war
.
<EOS>
They
be
fit
out
at
a
very
small
expence
,
and
use
to
run
over
in
the
night
to
the
coast
of
England
,
where
they
hover
as
English
fishing
smack
,
until
they
kidnap
some
coaster
,
with
which
they
make
the
good
of
their
way
across
the
Channel
.
<EOS>
if
they
fall
in
with
a
british
cruiser
,
they
surrender
without
resistance
:
the
captain
be
soon
exchange
,
and
the
loss
of
the
proprietor
be
not
great
:
if
they
bring
their
prize
safe
into
harbour
,
the
advantage
be
considerable
.
<EOS>
in
time
of
peace
the
merchant
of
Boulogne
deal
in
wine
brandy
,
and
oil
,
import
from
the
South
,
and
export
fish
,
with
the
manufacture
of
France
,
to
Portugal
,
and
other
country
;
but
the
trade
be
not
great
.
<EOS>
here
be
two
or
three
considerable
house
of
wine
merchant
from
Britain
,
who
deal
in
Bourdeaux
wine
,
with
which
they
supply
London
and
other
part
of
England
,
Scotland
,
and
Ireland
.
<EOS>
the
fishery
of
mackarel
and
herre
be
so
considerable
on
this
coast
,
that
it
be
say
to
yield
annually
eight
or
nine
hundred
thousand
livre
,
about
thirty
-
five
thousand
pound
sterling
.
  
<EOS>
the
shop
-
keeper
here
drive
a
considerable
traffic
with
the
english
smuggler
,
whose
cutter
be
almost
the
only
vessel
one
see
in
the
harbour
of
Boulogne
,
if
we
except
about
a
dozen
of
those
flat
-
bottom
boat
,
which
raise
such
alarm
in
England
,
in
the
course
of
the
war
.
<EOS>
indeed
they
seem
to
be
good
for
nothing
else
,
and
perhaps
they
be
build
for
this
purpose
only
.
<EOS>
the
smuggler
from
the
coast
of
Kent
and
Sussex
pay
english
gold
for
great
quantity
of
french
brandy
,
tea
,
coffee
,
and
small
wine
,
which
they
run
from
this
country
.
<EOS>
They
likewise
buy
glass
trinket
,
toy
,
and
colour
print
,
which
sell
in
England
,
for
no
other
reason
,
but
that
they
come
from
France
,
as
they
may
be
have
as
cheap
,
and
much
better
finish
,
of
our
own
manufacture
.
<EOS>
They
likewise
take
off
ribbon
,
lace
,
linen
,
and
cambric
;
though
this
branch
of
trade
be
chiefly
in
the
hand
of
trader
that
come
from
London
and
make
their
purchase
at
Dunkirk
,
where
they
pay
no
duty
.
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
worth
while
for
any
traveller
to
lay
in
a
stock
of
linen
either
at
Dunkirk
or
Boulogne
;
the
difference
of
the
price
at
these
two
place
be
not
great
.
<EOS>
even
here
I
have
make
a
provision
of
shirt
for
one
half
of
the
money
they
would
have
cost
in
London
.
<EOS>
undoubtedly
the
practice
of
smuggling
be
very
detrimental
to
the
fair
trader
,
and
carry
considerable
sum
of
money
out
of
the
kingdom
,
to
enrich
our
rival
and
enemy
.
<EOS>
the
custom
-
house
officer
be
very
watchful
,
and
make
a
great
number
of
seizure
:
nevertheless
,
the
smuggler
find
their
account
in
continue
this
contraband
commerce
;
and
be
say
to
indemnify
themselves
,
if
they
save
one
cargo
out
of
three
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
the
good
way
to
prevent
smuggling
,
be
to
lower
the
duty
upon
the
commodity
which
be
thus
introduce
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
tell
,
that
the
revenue
upon
tea
have
encrease
ever
since
the
duty
upon
it
be
diminish
.
<EOS>
by
the
bye
,
the
tea
smuggle
on
the
coast
of
Sussex
be
most
execrable
stuff
.
<EOS>
while
I
stay
at
Hastings
,
for
the
conveniency
of
bathing
,
I
must
have
change
my
breakfast
,
if
I
have
not
luckily
bring
tea
with
me
from
London
:
yet
we
have
as
good
tea
at
Boulogne
for
nine
livre
a
pound
,
as
that
which
sell
at
fourteen
shilling
at
London
.
  
<EOS>
the
bourgeois
of
this
place
seem
to
live
at
their
ease
,
probably
in
consequence
of
their
trade
with
the
English
.
<EOS>
Their
house
consist
of
the
ground
-
floor
,
one
story
above
,
and
garret
.
<EOS>
in
those
which
be
well
furnished
,
you
see
pier
-
glass
and
marble
slab
;
but
the
chair
be
either
paultry
thing
,
make
with
straw
bottom
,
which
cost
about
a
shill
a
-
piece
,
or
old
-
fashioned
,
high
-
back
seat
of
needle
-
work
,
stuff
,
very
clumsy
and
incommodious
.
<EOS>
the
table
be
square
fir
board
,
that
stand
on
edge
in
a
corner
,
except
when
they
be
use
,
and
then
they
be
set
upon
cross
leg
that
open
and
shut
occasionally
.
<EOS>
the
king
of
France
dine
off
a
board
of
this
kind
.
<EOS>
here
be
plenty
of
table
-
linen
however
.
<EOS>
the
poor
tradesman
in
Boulogne
have
a
napkin
on
every
cover
,
and
silver
fork
with
four
prong
,
which
be
use
with
the
right
hand
,
there
be
very
little
occasion
for
knife
;
for
the
meat
be
boil
or
roast
to
rag
.
<EOS>
the
french
bed
be
so
high
,
that
sometimes
one
be
oblige
to
mount
them
by
the
help
of
step
;
and
this
be
also
the
case
in
flander
.
<EOS>
They
very
seldom
use
feather
-
bed
;
but
they
lie
upon
a
paillasse
,
or
bag
of
straw
,
over
which
be
lay
two
,
and
sometimes
three
mattrasse
.
<EOS>
Their
tester
be
high
and
old
-
fashioned
,
and
their
curtain
generally
of
thin
bay
,
red
,
or
green
,
lace
with
taudry
yellow
,
in
imitation
of
gold
.
<EOS>
in
some
house
,
however
,
one
meet
with
furniture
of
stamped
linen
;
but
there
be
no
such
thing
as
a
carpet
to
be
see
,
and
the
floor
be
in
a
very
dirty
condition
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
even
the
implement
of
cleanliness
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
every
chamber
be
furnish
with
an
armoire
,
or
clothe

press
,
and
a
chest
of
drawer
,
of
very
clumsy
workmanship
.
<EOS>
every
thing
shew
a
deficiency
in
the
mechanic
art
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
door
,
nor
a
window
,
that
shut
close
.
<EOS>
the
hinge
,
lock
,
and
latch
,
be
of
iron
,
coarsely
make
,
and
ill
contrived
.
<EOS>
the
very
chimnie
be
build
so
open
,
that
they
admit
both
rain
and
sun
,
and
all
of
them
smoke
intolerably
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
no
cleanliness
among
these
people
,
much
less
shall
we
find
delicacy
,
which
be
the
cleanliness
of
the
mind
.
<EOS>
indeed
they
be
utter
stranger
to
what
we
call
common
decency
;
and
I
could
give
you
some
high
-
flavour
instance
,
at
which
even
a
native
of
Edinburgh
would
stop
his
nose
.
<EOS>
there
be
certain
mortify
view
of
human
nature
,
which
undoubtedly
ought
to
be
conceal
as
much
as
possible
,
in
order
to
prevent
give
offence
:
and
nothing
can
be
more
absurd
,
than
to
plead
the
difference
of
custom
in
different
country
,
in
defence
of
these
usage
which
can
not
fail
give
disgust
to
the
organ

sense
of
all
mankind

<EOS>
Will
custom
exempt
from
the
imputation
of
gross
indecency
a
french
lady
,
who
shift
her
frowsy
smock
in
presence
of
a
male
visitant

and
talk

him

I
should
be
glad
to
know

whether
it
be
possible
for
a
fine
lady
to
speak

act
in
this
manner

without
exciting

she
may

the
custom
of
her
country

<EOS>
there
be
nothing
so
vile
or
repugnant
to
nature
,
but
you
may
plead
prescription
for
it
,
in
the
custom
of
some
nation

other

<EOS>
a
parisian
like
mortify
flesh
:
<EOS>
a
native
of
Legiboli
will
not
taste
his
fish
till
it

quite
putrefy

the
civilized
inhabitant
of
Kamschatka
get
drunk
with
the
urine
of
their

,
whom
they
have
already
intoxicate
:
the

the

the

at
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope

piss
upon
those
whom
they
delight
to
honour
,
and
feast
upon
a
sheep

intestine
with
their
content
,
as
the
great
dainty
that
can

<EOS>
a
true

breed
Frenchman
dip
his
finger
,
imbrowne
with
snuff

into
his

fill
with
ragout

between
every
three
mouthful
<EOS>
,
he
produce
his
snuff

box
,
and
take
a
fresh
pinch
,
with
the
most
graceful
gesticulation
;
then
he
display
his
handkerchief
,
which
may
be
term
the
flag
of
abomination
,
and
,
in
the
use
of
both
,
scatter
his
favour
among
those
who
have
the
happiness
to
sit
near
him
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
own
,
however
,
that
a
Frenchman
will
not
drink
out
of
a
tankard
,
in
which
,
perhaps
,
a
dozen
of
filthy
mouth
have
flabbere

as
be
the
custom
in
England

<EOS>
here
every
individual
have
his
own
gobelet

which
stand
before
him

and
he
help
himself
occasionally
with
wine
or
water
,
or
both
,
which
likewise
stand
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
but
I
know
no
custom
more
beastly
than
that
of
use
water

glass

in
which
polite
company
spirt

squirt

filthy

<EOS>
I
do
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
I
shall
live
to
see
the
day
<EOS>
,
when
the
hospitable
custom
of
the
antient
aegyptian
will
be
revive
;
then
a
conveniency
will
be
place
behind
every
chair
in
company
,
with
a
proper
provision
of
waste
paper
,
that
individual
may
make
themselves
easy
without
part
company
.
<EOS>
I
insist
upon
it
,
that
this
practice
would
not
be
more
indelicate
than
that
which
be
now
in
use
.
<EOS>
what
then
,
you
will
say
,
must
a
man
sit
with
his
chop

finger
up
to
the
ear
and
knuckle
in
grease

<EOS>
no

let
those
who
can
not
eat
without
defile
themselves
,
step
into
another
room
,
provide
with
bason
and
towel
:
but
I
think
it
would
be
well
to
institute
school
,
where
youth
may
learn
to
eat
their
victual
,
without
daub
themselves
,
or
give
offence
to
the
eye
of
one
another

<EOS>
the
bourgeois
of
Boulogne
have
commonly
soup

bouilli

noon

roast

with
a
sallad

for
supper
;
and
at
all
their
meal
there
be
a
dessert
of
fruit
.
<EOS>
this
indeed
be
the
practice
all
over
France

<EOS>
on
meagre
day
they
eat
fish

omelette

fry
bean

fricassee

<EOS>
the
tea

they

afternoon
be
rather
boil

it
be
sweeten
all

coarse

the

that
all

the

grandee

,
in
a
word

with
all
the

on

against
the

the
farmer

who
,
he
say
,
have
ruin
France

<EOS>
then
,
address
himself
to
me
,
ask
,
if
the
English
do
not
every

drink
to
the
health
of
madame

I
do
not
at

comprehend
his
meaning

answer
in
general
,
that
the
English
be
not
deficient
in
complaisance
for
the
lady

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
(
cry
he

<EOS>
she

the
good

they
have
in

<EOS>
if
it

they
would
not

such
reason
to
boast
of

advantage
of
the

"
I
tell
him
the
only
conquest
which
the
French
have
make
in
the
war
,
be
atchieve
by
one
of
her
general
:
I
mean
the
taking
of
Mahon
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
choose
to
prosecute
the
discourse
,
remember
that
in
the
year
1749
,
I
have
like
to
have
have
an
affair
with
a
Frenchman
at
Ghent
,
who
affirm
,
that
all
the
battle
gain
by
the
great
duke
of
Marlborough
be
purposely
lose
by
the
french
general
,
in
order
to
bring
the
scheme
of
madame
de
Maintenon
into
disgrace
.
<EOS>
this
be
no
bad
resource
for
the
national
vanity
of
these
people

though
,
in
general

they
be
really
persuade
,
that
theirs
be
the
rich
,
the
brave
,
the
happy
,
and
the
most
powerful
nation
under

and
therefore
,
without
some
such
cause
,
they
must
be
invincible
.
<EOS>
by
the

the
common
people
here
still

their
wayward

It
be
amazing
to
hear
a
sensible
Frenchman
assert
,
that
the
revenue
of
France
amount
to
four
hundred
million
of
livre

about
twenty

when
in

their

without

they

You
will
see
every

in

a
great
number
of
female
thus
mount

with
the
foot

side
occasionally

accord

blow

when
I

the

keep
in
good
humour

the
fopperie

I
do
not

there
will
be
fanatic
in
religion

while
there
be
people
of
a
saturnine
disposition

melancholy
turn

mind

<EOS>
the
character
of
a
devotee
,
which
be
hardly
know
in
England

be
very
common
here

<EOS>
You
see
them
walk
to

from
church
at

hour

in
their
hood

long
camblet
cloak

with
a
slow
pace

demure
aspect

downcast
eye

<EOS>
those
who
be
poor
become
very
troublesome
to
the
monk
,
with
their
scruple
and
case
of
conscience
:
you
may
see
them
on
their
knee
,
at
the
confessional
,
every
hour
in
the
day

<EOS>
the
rich
devotee
have
her
favourite
confessor
,
whom
she
consult

regale
in
private
,
at
her
own
house
;
and
this
spiritual
director
generally
govern
the
whole
family
.
<EOS>
for
my
part
I
never
know
a
fanatic
that
be
not
an
hypocrite
at
bottom
.
<EOS>
Their
pretension
to
superior
sanctity
,
and
an
absolute
conquest
over
all
the
passion
,
which
human
reason
be
never
yet
able
to
subdue
,
introduce
a
habit
of
dissimulation
,
which
,
like
all
other
habit
,
be
confirm
by
use
,
till
at
length
they
become
adept
in
the
art
and
science
of
hypocrisy
.
<EOS>
enthusiasm
and
hypocrisy
be
by
no
mean
incompatible
.
<EOS>
the
wildest
fanatic
I
ever
know
,
be
real
sensualist
in
their
way
of
living
,
and
cunne
cheat
in
their
dealing
with
mankind
.
  
<EOS>
among
the
low
class
of
people
at
Boulogne
,
those
who
take
the
lead
,
be
the
sea
-
fare
man
,
who
live
in
one
quarter
,
divide
into
class
,
and
register
for
the
service
of
the
king
.
<EOS>
They
be
hardy
and
raw
-
boned
,
exercise
the
trade
of
fisherman
and
boatman
,
and
propagate
like
rabbit

<EOS>
They
have
put
themselves
under
the
protection
of
a
miraculous
image
of
the
Virgin
Mary
,
which
be
keep
in
one
of
their
church
,
and
every
year
carry
in
procession
.
<EOS>
accord
to
the
legend
,
this
image
be
carry
off
,
with
other
pillage
,
by
the
English
,
when
they
take
Boulogne
,
in
the
reign
of
Henry
VIII
.
<EOS>
the
lady
,
rather
than
reside
in
England
,
where
she
find
a
great
many
heretic
,
trust
herself
alone
in
an
open
boat
,
and
cross
the
sea
to
the
road
of
Boulogne
,
where
she
be
see
wait
for
a
pilot
.
<EOS>
accordingly
a
boat
put
off
to
her
assistance
,
and
bring
her
safe
into
the
harbour
:
since
which
time
she
have
continue
to
patronize
the
waterman
of
Boulogne
.
<EOS>
at
present
she
be
very
black
and
very
ugly
,
besides
be
cruelly
mutilate
in
different
part
of
her
body
,
which
I
suppose
have
be
amputate
,
and
convert
into
tobacco
-
stopper
;
but
once
a
year
she
be
dress
in
very
rich
attire
,
and
carry
in
procession
,
with
a
silver
boat
,
provide
at
the
expence
of
the
sailor
.
<EOS>
that
vanity
which
characterise
the
french
extend
even
to
the
canaille
.
<EOS>
the
low
creature
among
them
be
sure
to
have
her
ear
-
ring
and
golden
cross
hang
about
her
neck
.
<EOS>
indeed
this
last
be
an
implement
of
superstition
as
well
as
of
dress
,
without
which
no
female
appear
.
<EOS>
the
common
people
here
,
as
in
all
country
where
they
live
poorly
and
dirtily
,
be
hard
-
featured
,
and
of
very
brown
,
or
rather
tawny
complexion
.
<EOS>
as
they
seldom
eat
meat
,
their
juice
be
destitute
of
that
animal
oil
which
give
a
plumpness
and
smoothness
to
the
skin
,
and
defend
those
fine
capillary
from
the
injury
of
the
weather
,
which
would
otherwise
coalesce
,
or
be
shrink
up
,
so
as
to
impede
the
circulation
on
the
external
surface
of
the
body
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
dirt
,
it
undoubtedly
block
up
the
pore
of
the
skin
,
and
disorder
the
perspiration
;
consequently
must
contribute
to
the
scurvy
,
itch
,
and
other
cutaneous
distemper
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
quarter
of
the
matelot
at
Boulogne
,
there
be
a
number
of
poor
Canadians
,
who
be
remove
from
the
island
of
St
John

in
the
gulph
of
St

when
it

<EOS>
these
people
be
maintain
at

who
allow
them
soldier
's
pay
,
that
be
five
sol
,
or
two

pence
halfpenny
a
day
;
or
rather
three
sol
and
ammunition
bread
.
<EOS>
how
the
soldier
contrive
to
subsist
upon
this
wretched
allowance
,
I
can
not
comprehend
:
<EOS>
but
,
it
must
be
own
,
<EOS>
that
those
invalid
who
do
duty
at
Boulogne
betray
no
mark
of
want
.
<EOS>
They
be
hale
and
stout
,
neatly
and
decently
cloathe

and
on

whole
look
well
than

<EOS>
about
three
week
ago
I
be
favour
with
a
visit
by
one
<EOS>
Mr
M
 
,
an
english
gentleman
,
who
seem
far
go
in
a
consumption
.
<EOS>
He
pass
the
last
winter
at
Nismes
in
Languedoc
,
and
find
himself
much
better
in
the
beginning
of
summer
,
when
he
embark
at
Cette
,
and
return
by
sea
to
England
.
<EOS>
He
soon
relapse
,
however
,
and
(
as
he
imagine
)
in
consequence
of
a
cold
catch
at
sea
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
his
intention
be
to
try
the
South
again
,
and
even
to
go
as
far
as
Italy
.
<EOS>
I
advise
him
to
make
trial
of
the
air
of
Nice
,
where
I
myself
propose
to
reside
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
relish
my
advice
,
and
proceed
towards
Paris
in
his
own
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
to
-
morrow
ship
<EOS>
my
great
chest
on
board
of
a
ship
bind
to
Bourdeaux
;
they
be
direct
,
and
recommend
to
the
care
of
a
merchant
of
that
place
,
who
will
forward
them
by
Thoulouse
,
and
the
canal
of
Languedoc
,
to
his
correspondent
at
Cette
,
which
be
the
sea
-
port
of
Montpellier
.
<EOS>
the
charge
of
their
conveyance
to
Bourdeaux
do
not
exceed
one
guinea
.
<EOS>
They
consist
of
two
very
large
chest
and
a
trunk
,
about
a
thousand
pound
weight
;
and
the
expence
of
transport
them
from
Bourdeaux
to
Cette
,
will
not
exceed
thirty
livre
.
<EOS>
They
be
already
seal
with
lead
at
the
customhouse
,
that
they
may
be
exempt
from
further
visitation
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
precaution
which
every
traveller
take
,
both
by
sea
and
land
:
he
must
likewise
provide
himself
with
a
passe

avant
at
the
bureau
,
otherwise
he
may
be
stop
,
and
rummage
at
every
town
through
which
he
pass

<EOS>
I
have
hire
a
berline
and
four
horse

for
fourteen
loui'dore

two

the
voiturier
be

for
every
thing
be
farm
in
this
country
;
and
if
you
hire
a
carriage
,
as
I
have
do
,
you
must
pay
twelve
livre
,
or
half
-
a

guinea
,
for
every
person
that
travel
in
it

<EOS>
the
common
coach
between
Calais

Paris

be
such
a
vehicle
as
no
man
would
use
,

have
any
regard

his

it
travel
at

pace

an
english
waggon

<EOS>
in
ten
day
I
shall
set
out
on
my
journey

I
shall
leave
Boulogne
with
regret

<EOS>
I
have
be
happy
in
the
acquaintance
of
Mrs
B
 
,
and
a
few
british
family
in
the
place

and
it
be
my
good
fortune
to
meet
here
with
two
honest
gentleman
,
whom
I
have
formerly
know
in
Paris
,
as
well
as
with
some

My

I
be
a
little
heavy

hearted
at
the
prospect
of
remove
to
such
a
distance
from
you

It
be
a

PARIS
,
October
12
,
1763
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
of
our
journey
from
Boulogne
<EOS>
I
have
little
to
say
.
<EOS>
the
weather
be
favourable
,
and
the
road
be
in
tolerable
order
.
<EOS>
We
find
good
accommodation
at
Montreuil
and
Amiens
;
but
in
every
other
place
where
we
stop
,
we
meet
with
abundance
of
dirt
,
and
the
most
flagrant
imposition
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
pretend
to
describe
the
city
of
Abbeville
and
Amiens
,
which
we
see
only
en
passant
;
nor
take
up
your
time
with
an
account
of
the
stable
and
palace
of
Chantilly
,
belong
to
the
prince
of
Conde
,
which
we
visit
the
last
day
of
our
journey
;
nor
shall
I
detain
you
with
a
detail
of
the
Trefors
de
St
Denis
,
which
,
together
with
the
tomb
in
the
abbey
church
,
afford
us
some
amusement
while
our
dinner
be
get
ready
.
<EOS>
all
these
particular
be
mention
in
twenty
different
book
of
tour
,
travel
,
and
direction
,
which
you
have
often
peruse
.
<EOS>
I
shall
only
observe
,
that
the
abbey
church
be
the
light
piece
of
gothic
architecture
I
have
see
,
and
the
air
within
seem
perfectly
free
from
that
damp
and
moisture
,
so
perceivable
in
all
our
old
cathedral
.
<EOS>
this
must
be
owe
to
the
nature
of
its
situation
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
fine
marble
statue
that
adorn
the
tomb
of
certain
individual
here
inter
;
but
they
be
mostly
in
the
french
taste
,
which
be
quite
contrary
to
the
simplicity
of
the
antient
.
<EOS>
Their
attitude
be
affect
,
unnatural
,
and
desultory
;
and
their
drapery
fantastic
;
or
,
as
one
of
our
english
artist
express
himself
,
they
be
all
of
a
flutter
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
treasure
,
which
be
shew
on
certain
day
to
the
populace
gratis
,
they
be
contain
in
a
number
of
press
,
or
armoire
,
and
,
if
the
stone
be
genuine
,
they
must
be
inestimable
:
but
this
I
can
not
believe
.
<EOS>
indeed
I
have
be
tell
,
that
what
they
shew
as
diamond
be
no
more
than
composition
:
nevertheless
,
exclusive
of
these
,
there
be
some
rough
stone
of
great
value
,
and
many
curiosity
worth
see
.
<EOS>
the
monk
that
shew
them
be
the
very
image
of
our
friend
Hamilton
,
both
in
his
look
and
manner
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
one
thing
very
extraordinary
to
observe
of
the
french
auberge
,
which
seem
to
be
a
remarkable
deviation
from
the
general
character
of
the
nation
.
<EOS>
the
landlord
,
hostess
,
and
servant
of
the
inn
upon
the
road
,
have
not
the
least
dash
of
complaisance
in
their
behaviour
to
stranger
.
<EOS>
instead
of
come
to
the
door
,
to
receive
you
as
in
England
,
they
take
no
manner
of
notice
of
you
;
but
leave
you
to
find
or
enquire
your
way
into
the
kitchen
,
and
there
you
must
ask
several
time
for
a
chamber
,
before
they
seem
willing
to
conduct
you
up
stair
.
<EOS>
in
general
,
you
be
serve
with
the
appearance
of
the
most
mortifying
indifference
,
at
the
very
time
they
be
lay
scheme
for
fleece
you
of
your
money
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
odd
contrast
between
France
and
England
;
in
the
former
all
the
people
be
complaisant
but
the
publican
;
in
the
latter
there
be
hardly
any
complaisance
but
among
the
publican
.
<EOS>
when
I
say
all
the
people
in
France
,
I
ought
also
to
except
those
vermin
who
examine
the
baggage
of
traveller
in
different
part
of
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
although
our
portmanteaus
be
seal
with
lead
,
and
we
be
provide
with
a
passe
-
avant
from
the
douane
,
our
coach
be
search
at
the
gate
of
Paris
by
which
we
enter
;
and
the
woman
be
oblige
to
get
out
,
and
stand
in
the
open
street
,
till
this
operation
be
perform
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
desire
a
friend
to
provide
lodging
for
me
at
Paris
,
in
the
Fauxbourg
St
Germain
;
and
accordingly
we
find
ourselves
accommodate
at
the
Hotel
de
Montmorency
,
with
a
first
floor
,
which
cost
me
ten
livre
a
day
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
put
up
with
it
<EOS>
have
it
be
less
polite
;
but
as
I
have
only
a
few
day
to
stay
in
this
place
,
and
some
visit
to
receive
,
I
be
not
sorry
that
my
friend
have
exceed
his
commission
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
guilty
of
another
piece
of
extravagance
in
hire
a
carosse
de
remise
,
for
which
I
pay
twelve
livre
a
day
.
<EOS>
besides
the
article
of
visit
,
I
could
not
leave
Paris
,
without
carry
my
wife
and
the
girl
to
see
the
most
remarkable
place
in
and
about
this
capital
,
such
as
the
Luxemburg
,
the
Palais
-
Royal
,
the
Thuilleries
,
the
Louvre
,
the
Invalids
,
the
Gobelins
,
&
c.
together
with
Versailles
,
Trianon
,
Marli
,
Meudon
,
and
Choissi
;
and
therefore
,
I
think
the
difference
in
point
of
expence
would
not
be
great
,
between
a
carosse
de
remise
and
a
hackney
coach
.
<EOS>
the
first
be
extremely
elegant
,
if
not
too
much
ornamented
,
the
last
be
very
shabby
and
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
nothing
give
me
such
chagrin
,
as
the
necessity
I
be
under
to
hire
a
valet
de
place
,
as
my
own
servant
do
not
speak
the
language
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
conceive
with
what
eagerness
and
dexterity
<EOS>
those
rascally
valet
exert
themselves
in
pillage
stranger
.
<EOS>
there
be
always
one
ready
in
wait
on
your
arrival
,
who
begin
by
assist
your
own
servant
to
unload
your
baggage
,
and
interest
himself
in
your
affair
with
such
artful
officiousness
,
that
you
will
find
it
difficult
to
shake
him
off
,
even
though
you
be
determine
beforehand
against
hire
any
such
domestic
.
<EOS>
He
produce
recommendation
from
his
former
master
,
and
the
people
of
the
house
vouch
for
his
honesty
.
  
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
those
fellow
be
very
handy
,
useful
,
and
obliging
;
and
so
far
honest
,
that
they
will
not
steal
in
the
usual
way
.
<EOS>
You
may
safely
trust
one
of
them
to
bring
you
a
hundred
loui'dores
from
your
banker
;
but
they
fleece
you
without
mercy
in
every
other
article
of
expence
.
<EOS>
They
lie
all
your
tradesman
under
contribution
;
your
taylor
,
barber
,
mantua
-
maker
,
milliner
,
perfumer
,
shoe
-
maker
,
mercer
,
jeweller
,
hatter
,
traiteur
,
and
wine
-
merchant
:
even
the
bourgeois
who
own
your
coach
pay
him
twenty
sol
per
day
.
<EOS>
His
wage
amount
to
twice
as
much
,
so
that
I
imagine
the
fellow
that
serve
me
,
make
above
ten
shilling
a
day
,
besides
his
victual
,
which
,
by
the
bye
,
he
have
no
right
to
demand
.
<EOS>
live
at
Paris
,
to
the
good
of
my
recollection
,
be
very
near
twice
as
dear
as
it
be
fifteen
year
ago
;
and
,
indeed
,
this
be
the
case
in
London
;
a
circumstance
that
must
be
undoubtedly
owe
to
an
increase
of
taxis
;
for
I
do
not
find
that
in
the
article
of
eating
and
drink
,
the
french
people
be
more
luxurious
than
they
be
heretofore
.
<EOS>
I
be
tell
the
entree
,
or
duty
,
pay
upon
provision
import
into
Paris
,
be
very
heavy
.
<EOS>
all
manner
of
butcher
's
meat
and
poultry
be
extremely
good
in
this
place
.
<EOS>
the
beef
be
excellent
.
<EOS>
the
wine
,
which
be
generally
drink
,
be
a
very
thin
kind
of
Burgundy
.
<EOS>
I
can
by
no
means
relish
their
cookery
;
but
one
breakfast
deliciously
upon
their
petit
pain
and
their
pale
of
butter
,
which
last
be
exquisite
.
  
<EOS>
the
common
people
,
and
even
the
bourgeois
of
Paris
live
,
at
this
season
,
chiefly
on
bread
and
grape
,
which
be
undoubtedly
very
wholsome
fare
.
<EOS>
if
the
same
simplicity
of
diet
prevail
in
England
,
we
should
certainly
undersell
the
French
at
all
foreign
market
for
they
be
very
slothful
with
all
their
vivacity
and
the
great
number
of
their
holiday
not
only
encourage
this
lazy
disposition
,
but
actually
rob
them
of
one
half
of
what
their
labour
would
otherwise
produce
;
so
that
,
if
our
common
people
be
not
so
expensive
in
their
living
,
that
is
,
in
their
eating
and
drinking
,
labour
may
be
afford
cheap
in
England
than
in
France
.
<EOS>
there
be
three
young
lusty
hussy
,
niece
or
daughter
of
a
blacksmith
,
that
live
just
opposite
to
my
window
,
who
do
nothing
from
morning
till
night
.
<EOS>
They
eat
grape
and
bread
from
seven
till
nine
,
from
nine
till
twelve
they
dress
their
hair
,
and
be
all
the
afternoon
gape
at
the
window
to
view
passenger
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
perceive
that
they
give
themselves
the
trouble
either
to
make
their
bed
,
or
clean
their
apartment
.
<EOS>
the
same
spirit
of
idleness
and
dissipation
I
have
observe
in
every
part
of
France
,
and
among
every
class
of
people
.
  
<EOS>
every
object
seem
to
have
shrink
in
its
dimension
since
I
be
last
in
Paris
.
<EOS>
the
Louvre
,
the
Palais
-
Royal
,
the
bridge
,
and
the
river
Seine
,
by
no
mean
answer
the
idea
I
have
form
of
them
from
my
former
observation
.
<EOS>
when
the
memory
be
not
very
correct
,
the
imagination
always
betray
her
into
such
extravagance
.
<EOS>
when
I
first
revisit
my
own
country
,
after
an
absence
of
fifteen
year
,
I
find
every
thing
diminish
in
the
same
manner
,
and
I
could
scarce
believe
my
own
eye
.
  
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
gay
disposition
of
the
French
,
their
house
be
all
gloomy
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
all
the
ornament
that
have
be
lavish
on
Versailles
,
it
be
a
dismal
habitation
.
<EOS>
the
apartment
be
dark
,
ill
-
furnished
,
dirty
,
and
unprincely
.
<EOS>
take
the
castle
,
chapel
,
and
garden
all
together
,
they
make
a
most
fantastic
composition
of
magnificence
and
littleness
,
taste
,
and
foppery
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
it
be
in
England
only
,
where
we
must
look
for
cheerful
apartment
,
gay
furniture
,
neatness
,
and
convenience
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
strange
incongruity
in
the
french
genius
.
<EOS>
with
all
their
volatility
,
prattle
,
and
fondness
for
bon
mot
,
they
delight
in
a
species
of
drawl
,
melancholy
,
church
music
.
<EOS>
Their
most
favourite
dramatic
piece
be
almost
without
incident
;
and
the
dialogue
of
their
comedy
consist
of
moral
,
insipid
apophthegms
,
intirely
destitute
of
wit
or
repartee
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
hazard
by
this
opinion
among
the
implicit
admirer
of
Lully
,
Racine
,
and
Moliere
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
talk
of
the
bust
,
the
statue
,
and
picture
which
abound
at
Versailles
,
and
other
place
in
and
about
Paris
,
particularly
the
great
collection
of
capital
piece
in
the
Palais
-
royal
,
belong
to
the
duke
of
Orleans
.
<EOS>
I
have
neither
capacity
,
nor
inclination
,
to
give
a
critique
on
these
chef
d'oeuvres
,
which
indeed
would
take
up
a
whole
volume
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
this
great
magazine
of
paint
three
time
,
with
astonishment
;
but
I
should
have
be
better
please
,
if
there
have
not
be
half
the
number
:
one
be
bewilder
in
such
a
profusion
,
as
not
to
know
where
to
begin
,
and
hurry
away
before
there
be
time
to
consider
one
piece
with
any
sort
of
deliberation
.
<EOS>
besides
,
the
room
be
all
dark
,
and
a
great
many
of
the
picture
hang
in
a
bad
light
.
<EOS>
as
for
Trianon
,
Marli
,
and
Choissi
,
they
be
no
more
than
pigeon
-
house
,
in
respect
to
palace
;
and
,
notwithstanding
the
extravagant
eulogium
which
you
have
hear
of
the
french
king
's
house
,
I
will
venture
to
affirm
that
the
king
of
England
be
well
,
I
mean
more
comfortably
,
lodge
.
<EOS>
I
ought
,
however
,
to
except
Fontainebleau
,
which
I
have
not
see
.
  
<EOS>
the
city
of
Paris
be
say
to
be
five
league
,
or
fifteen
mile
,
in
circumference
;
and
if
it
be
really
so
,
it
must
be
much
more
populous
than
London
;
for
the
street
be
very
narrow
,
and
the
house
very
high
,
with
a
different
family
on
every
floor
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
measure
the
good
plan
of
these
two
royal
city
,
and
be
certain
that
Paris
do
not
take
up
near
so
much
ground
as
London
and
Westminster
occupy
;
and
I
suspect
the
number
of
its
inhabitant
be
also
exaggerate
by
those
who
say
it
amount
to
eight
hundred
thousand
,
that
be
two
hundred
thousand
more
than
be
contain
in
the
bill
of
mortality
.
<EOS>
the
hotel
of
the
french
noblesse
,
at
Paris
,
take
up
a
great
deal
of
room
,
with
their
courtyard
and
garden
;
and
so
do
their
convent
and
church
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
own
,
indeed
,
that
their
street
be
wonderfully
croude
with
people
and
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
the
French
begin
to
imitate
the
English
,
but
only
in
such
particular
as
render
them
worthy
of
imitation
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
last
at
Paris
,
no
person
of
any
condition
,
male
or
female
,
appear
,
but
in
full
dress
,
even
when
oblige
to
come
out
early
in
the
morning
,
and
there
be
not
such
a
thing
to
be
see
as
a
perruque
ronde
;
but
at
present
I
see
a
number
of
frock
and
scratch
in
a
morning
,
in
the
street
of
this
metropolis
.
<EOS>
They
have
set
up
a
petite
poste
,
on
the
plan
of
our
penny
-
post
,
with
some
improvement
;
and
I
be
tell
there
be
a
scheme
on
foot
for
supply
every
house
with
water
,
by
leaden
pipe
,
from
the
river
Seine
.
<EOS>
They
have
even
adopt
our
practice
of
the
cold
bath
,
which
be
take
very
conveniently
,
in
wooden
house
,
erect
on
the
side
of
the
river
,
the
water
of
which
be
let
in
and
out
occasionally
,
by
cock
fix
in
the
side
of
the
bath
.
<EOS>
there
be
different
room
for
the
different
sex
:
the
accommodation
be
good
,
and
the
expence
be
a
trifle
.
<EOS>
the
tapestry
of
the
Gobelins
be
bring
to
an
amazing
degree
of
perfection
;
and
I
be
surprised
that
this
furniture
be
not
more
in
fashion
among
the
great
,
who
alone
be
able
to
purchase
it
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
most
elegant
and
magnificent
ornament
,
which
would
always
nobly
distinguish
their
apartment
from
those
,
of
an
inferior
rank
;
and
in
this
they
would
run
no
risk
of
be
rival
by
the
bourgeois
.
<EOS>
at
the
village
of
Chaillot
,
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Paris
,
they
make
beautiful
carpet
and
screen
-
work
;
and
this
be
the
more
extraordinary
,
as
there
be
hardly
any
carpet
use
in
this
kingdom
.
<EOS>
in
almost
all
the
lodging
-
house
,
the
floor
be
of
brick
,
and
have
no
other
kind
of
cleaning
,
than
that
of
be
sprinkle
with
water
,
and
sweep
once
a
day
.
<EOS>
these
brick
floor
,
the
stone
stair
,
the
want
of
wainscotting
in
the
room
,
and
the
thick
party
-
wall
of
stone
,
be
,
however
,
good
preservative
against
fire
,
which
seldom
do
any
damage
in
this
city
.
<EOS>
instead
of
wainscotting
,
the
wall
be
cover
with
tapestry
or
damask
.
<EOS>
the
bed
in
general
be
very
good
,
and
well
ornamented
,
with
tester
and
curtain
.
  
<EOS>
twenty
year
ago
the
river
Seine
,
within
a
mile
of
Paris
,
be
as
solitary
as
if
it
have
run
through
a
desert
.
<EOS>
at
present
the
bank
of
it
be
adorn
with
a
number
of
elegant
house
and
plantation
,
as
far
as
Marli
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
mention
the
machine
at
this
place
for
raise
water
,
because
I
know
you
be
well
acquainted
with
its
construction
;
nor
shall
I
say
any
thing
more
of
the
city
of
Paris
,
but
that
there
be
a
new
square
,
build
upon
an
elegant
plan
,
at
the
end
of
the
garden
of
the
Thuilleries
:
it
be
call
Place
de
Louis
XV
and
,
in
the
middle
of
it
,
there
be
a
good
equestrian
statue
of
the
reign
king
.
  
<EOS>
You
have
often
hear
that
Louis
XIV
frequently
regret
,
that
his
country
do
not
afford
gravel
for
the
walk
of
his
garden
,
which
be
cover
with
a
white
,
loose
sand
,
very
disagreeable
both
to
the
eye
and
foot
of
those
who
walk
upon
it
;
but
this
be
a
vulgar
mistake
.
<EOS>
there
be
plenty
of
gravel
on
the
road
between
Paris
and
Versailles
,
as
well
as
in
many
other
part
of
this
kingdom
;
but
the
French
,
who
be
all
for
glare
and
glitter
,
think
the
other
be
more
gay
and
agreeable
:
one
would
imagine
they
do
not
feel
the
burn
reflexion
from
the
white
sand
,
which
in
summer
be
almost
intolerable
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
character
of
the
French
,
consider
as
a
people
,
there
be
undoubtedly
many
circumstance
truly
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
fashionable
people
,
who
go
a
hunting
,
be
equip
with
their
jack
boot
,
bag
wig
,
sword
and
pistol
:
<EOS>
but
I
see
the
other
day
a
scene
still
more
grotesque
.
<EOS>
on
the
road
to
Choissi
,
a
fiacre
,
or
hackney
-
coach
,
stop
,
and
out
come
five
or
six
man
,
arm
with
musquet
,
who
take
post
,
each
behind
a
separate
tree
.
<EOS>
I
ask
our
servant
who
they
be
imagine
they
may
be
archer
,
or
footpad
of
justice
,
in
pursuit
of
some
malefactor
.
<EOS>
but
guess
my
surprise
,
when
the
fellow
tell
me
,
they
be
gentleman
a
la
chasse
.
<EOS>
They
be
in
fact
come
out
from
Paris
,
in
this
equipage
,
to
take
the
diversion
of
hare
-
hunting
;
that
is
,
of
shoot
from
behind
a
tree
at
the
hare
that
chance
to
pass
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
if
they
have
nothing
more
in
view
,
but
to
destroy
the
game
,
this
be
a
very
effectual
method
;
for
the
hare
be
in
such
plenty
in
this
neighbourhood
,
that
I
have
see
a
dozen
together
,
in
the
same
field
.
<EOS>
I
think
this
way
of
hunting
,
in
a
coach
or
chariot
,
may
be
properly
adopt
at
London
,
in
favour
of
those
alderman
of
the
city
,
who
be
too
unwieldy
to
follow
the
hound
a
horseback
.
  
<EOS>
the
French
,
however
,
with
all
their
absurdity
,
preserve
a
certain
ascendancy
over
us
,
which
be
very
disgraceful
to
our
nation
;
and
this
appear
in
nothing
more
than
in
the
article
of
dress
.
<EOS>
We
be
contented
to
be
think
their
ape
in
fashion
;
but
,
in
fact
,
we
be
slave
to
their
taylor
,
mantua
-
maker
,
barber
,
and
other
tradesman
.
<EOS>
one
would
be
apt
to
imagine
that
our
own
tradesman
have
join
them
in
a
combination
against
us
.
<EOS>
when
the
native
of
France
come
to
London
,
they
appear
in
all
public
place
,
with
cloath
make
accord
to
the
fashion
of
their
own
country
,
and
this
fashion
be
generally
admire
by
the
English
.
<EOS>
why
,
therefore
,
do
not
we
follow
it
implicitly
?
<EOS>
no
,
we
pique
ourselves
upon
a
most
ridiculous
deviation
from
the
very
mode
we
admire
,
and
please
ourselves
with
think
this
deviation
be
a
mark
of
our
spirit
and
liberty
.
<EOS>
but
,
we
have
not
spirit
enough
to
persist
in
this
deviation
,
when
we
visit
their
country
:
<EOS>
otherwise
,
perhaps
,
they
would
come
to
admire
and
follow
our
example
:
for
,
certainly
,
in
point
of
true
taste
,
the
fashion
of
both
country
be
equally
absurd
.
<EOS>
at
present
,
the
skirt
of
the
English
descend
from
the
fifth
rib
to
the
calf
of
the
leg
,
and
give
the
coat
the
form
of
a
jewish
gaberdine
;
and
our
hat
seem
to
be
model
after
that
which
Pistol
wear
upon
the
stage
.
<EOS>
in
France
,
the
haunch
button
and
pockethole
be
within
half
a
foot
of
the
coat
's
extremity
:
their
hat
look
as
if
they
have
be
pare
round
the
brim
,
and
the
crown
be
cover
with
a
kind
of
cordage
,
which
,
in
my
opinion
,
produce
a
very
beggarly
effect
.
<EOS>
in
every
other
circumstance
of
dress
,
male
and
female
,
the
contrast
between
the
two
nation
,
appear
equally
glaring
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
consequence
?
<EOS>
when
an
Englishman
come
to
Paris
,
he
can
not
appear
until
he
have
undergo
a
total
metamorphosis
.
<EOS>
at
his
first
arrival
he
find
it
necessary
to
send
for
the
taylor
,
perruquier
,
hatter
,
shoemaker
,
and
every
other
tradesman
concern
in
the
equipment
of
the
human
body
.
<EOS>
He
must
even
change
his
buckle
,
and
the
form
of
his
ruffle
;
and
,
though
at
the
risque
of
his
life
,
suit
his
cloath
to
the
mode
of
the
season
.
<EOS>
for
example
,
though
the
weather
should
be
never
so
cold
,
he
must
wear
his
habit
d'ete
,
or
demi
-
saison
.
<EOS>
without
presume
to
put
on
a
warm
dress
before
the
day
which
fashion
have
fix
for
that
purpose
;
and
neither
old
age
nor
infirmity
will
excuse
a
man
for
wear
his
hat
upon
his
head
,
either
at
home
or
abroad
.
<EOS>
female
be
(
if
possible
)
still
more
subject
to
the
caprice
of
fashion
;
and
as
the
article
of
their
dress
be
more
manifold
,
it
be
enough
to
make
a
man
's
heart
ake
to
see
his
wife
surround
by
a
multitude
of
cotturiere
,
milliner
,
and
tire
-
woman
.
<EOS>
all
her
sack
and
negligee
must
be
alter
and
new
trim
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
new
cap
,
new
lace
,
new
shoe
,
and
her
hair
new
cut
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
her
taffatie
for
the
summer
,
her
flower
silk
for
the
spring
and
autumn
,
her
sattin
and
damask
for
winter
.
<EOS>
the
good
man
,
who
use
to
wear
the
beau
drop
d'Angleterre
,
quite
plain
all
the
year
round
,
with
a
long
bob
,
or
tye
perriwig
,
must
here
provide
himself
with
a
camblet
suit
trim
with
silver
for
spring
and
autumn
,
with
silk
cloath
for
summer
,
and
cloth
lace
with
gold
,
or
velvet
for
winter
;
and
he
must
wear
his
bag
-
wig
a
la
pigeon
.
<EOS>
this
variety
of
dress
be
absolutely
indispensible
for
all
those
who
pretend
to
any
rank
above
the
meer
bourgeois
.
<EOS>
on
his
return
to
his
own
country
,
all
this
frippery
be
useless
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
appear
in
London
until
he
have
undergo
another
thorough
metamorphosis
;
so
that
he
will
have
some
reason
to
think
,
that
the
tradesman
of
Paris
and
London
have
combine
to
lay
him
under
contribution
:
and
they
,
no
doubt
,
be
the
director
who
regulate
the
fashion
in
both
capital
;
the
English
,
however
,
in
a
subordinate
capacity
:
for
the
puppet
of
their
making
will
not
pass
at
Paris
,
nor
indeed
in
any
other
part
of
Europe
;
whereas
a
french
petit
maitre
be
reckon
a
complete
figure
every
where
,
London
not
except
.
<EOS>
since
it
be
so
much
the
humour
of
the
English
at
present
to
run
abroad
,
I
wish
they
have
anti
-
gallican
spirit
enough
to
produce
themselves
in
their
own
genuine
english
dress
,
and
treat
the
french
mode
with
the
same
philosophical
contempt
,
which
be
shew
by
an
honest
gentleman
,
distinguish
by
the
name
of
Wig
-
Middleton
.
<EOS>
that
unshaken
patriot
still
appear
in
the
same
kind
of
scratch
perriwig
,
skim
-
dish
hat
,
and
slit
sleeve
,
which
be
wear
five
-
and
-
twenty
year
ago
,
and
have
invariably
persist
in
this
garb
,
in
defiance
of
all
the
revolution
of
the
mode
.
<EOS>
I
remember
a
student
in
the
temple
,
who
,
after
a
long
and
learned
investigation
of
the
to
kalon
,
or
beautiful
,
have
resolution
enough
to
let
his
beard
grow
,
and
wear
it
in
all
public
place
,
until
his
heir
at
law
apply
for
a
commission
of
lunacy
against
him
;
then
he
submit
to
the
razor
,
rather
than
run
any
risque
of
be
find
non
compos
.
  
<EOS>
before
I
conclude
,
I
must
tell
you
,
that
the
most
reputable
shop
-
keeper
and
tradesman
of
Paris
think
it
no
disgrace
to
practise
the
most
shameful
imposition
.
<EOS>
I
myself
know
an
instance
of
one
of
the
most
creditable
marchand
in
this
capital
,
who
demand
six
franc
an
ell
for
some
lutestring
,
lay
his
hand
upon
his
breast
at
the
same
time
,
and
declare
en
conscience
,
that
it
have
cost
him
within
three
sol
of
the
money
.
<EOS>
yet
in
less
than
three
minute
,
he
sell
it
for
four
and
a
half
,
and
when
the
buyer
upbraid
him
with
his
former
declaration
,
he
shrug
up
his
shoulder
,
say
,
il
faut
marchander
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mention
this
as
a
particular
instance
.
<EOS>
the
same
mean
disingenuity
be
universal
all
over
France
,
as
I
have
be
inform
by
several
person
of
veracity
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
letter
you
have
from
me
will
probably
be
date
at
Nismes
,
or

<EOS>
MADAM
,
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
much
pleased
if
the
remark
I
have
make
on
the
character
of
the
french
people
,
can
afford
you
the
satisfaction
you
require
.
<EOS>
with
respect
to
the
lady
I
can
only
judge
from
their
exterior
:
but
,
indeed
,
these
be
so
characteristic
,
that
one
can
hardly
judge
amiss
;
unless
we
suppose
that
a
woman
of
taste
and
sentiment
may
be
so
overrule
by
the
absurdity
of
what
be
call
fashion
,
as
to
reject
reason
,
and
disguise
nature
,
in
order
to
become
ridiculous
or
frightful
.
<EOS>
that
this
may
be
the
case
with
some
individual
,
be
very
possible
.
<EOS>
I
have
know
it
happen
in
our
own
country
,
where
the
folly
of
the
French
be
adopt
and
exhibit
in
the
most
aukward
imitation
:
but
the
general
prevalence
of
those
preposterous
mode
,
be
a
plain
proof
that
there
be
a
general
want
of
taste
,
and
a
general
depravity
of
nature
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
pretend
to
describe
the
particular
of
a
french
lady
's
dress
.
<EOS>
these
you
be
much
better
acquaint
with
than
I
can
pretend
to
be
:
but
this
I
will
be
bold
to
affirm
,
that
France
be
the
general
reservoir
from
which
all
the
absurdity
of
false
taste
,
luxury
,
and
extravagance
have
overflow
the
different
kingdom
and
state
of
Europe
.
<EOS>
the
spring
that
fill
this
reservoir
,
be
no
other
than
vanity
and
ignorance
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
superfluous
to
attempt
prove
from
the
nature
of
thing
,
from
the
first
principle
and
use
of
dress
,
as
well
as
from
the
consideration
of
natural
beauty
,
and
the
practice
of
the
ancient
,
who
certainly
understand
it
as
well
as
the
connoisseur
of
these
day
,
that
nothing
can
be
more
monstrous
,
inconvenient
,
and
contemptible
,
than
the
fashion
of
modern
drapery
.
<EOS>
You
yourself
be
well
aware
of
all
its
defect
,
and
have
often
ridicule
them
in
my
hearing
.
<EOS>
I
shall
only
mention
one
particular
of
dress
essential
to
the
fashion
in
this
country
,
which
seem
to
me
to
carry
human
affectation
to
the
very
farth
verge
of
folly
and
extravagance
;
that
is
,
the
manner
in
which
the
face
of
the
lady
be
prime
and
paint
.
<EOS>
when
the
indian
chief
be
in
England
every
body
ridicule
their
preposterous
method
of
paint
their
cheek
and
eye
-
lid
;
but
this
ridicule
be
wrong
place
.
<EOS>
those
critic
ought
to
have
consider
,
that
the
Indians
do
not
use
paint
to
make
themselves
agreeable
;
but
in
order
to
be
the
more
terrible
to
their
enemy
.
<EOS>
It
be
generally
suppose
,
I
think
,
that
your
sex
make
use
of
fard
and
vermillion
for
very
different
purpose
;
namely
,
to
help
a
bad
or
fade
complexion
,
to
heighten
the
grace
,
or
conceal
the
defect
of
nature
,
as
well
as
the
ravage
of
time
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
enquire
at
present
,
whether
it
be
just
and
honest
to
impose
in
this
manner
on
mankind
:
if
it
be
not
honest
,
it
may
be
allow
to
be
artful
and
politic
,
and
shew
,
at
least
,
a
desire
of
be
agreeable
.
<EOS>
but
to
lay
it
on
as
the
fashion
in
France
prescribe
to
all
the
lady
of
condition
,
who
indeed
can
not
appear
without
this
badge
of
distinction
,
be
to
disguise
themselves
in
such
a
manner
,
as
to
render
them
odious
and
detestable
to
every
spectator
,
who
have
the
least
relish
leave
for
nature
and
propriety
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
fard
or
white
,
with
which
their
neck
and
shoulder
be
plaistered
,
it
may
be
in
some
measure
excusable
,
as
their
skin
be
naturally
brown
,
or
sallow
;
but
the
rouge
,
which
be
daub
on
their
face
,
from
the
chin
up
to
the
eye
,
without
the
least
art
or
dexterity
,
not
only
destroy
all
distinction
of
feature
,
but
render
the
aspect
really
frightful
,
or
at
good
convey
nothing
but
idea
of
disgust
and
aversion
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
that
without
this
horrible
masque
no
married
lady
be
admit
at
court
,
or
in
any
polite
assembly
;
and
that
it
be
a
mark
of
distinction
which
no
bourgeoise
dare
assume
.
<EOS>
lady
of
fashion
only
have
the
privilege
of
expose
themselves
in
these
ungracious
colour
.
<EOS>
as
their
face
be
conceal
under
a
false
complexion
,
so
their
head
be
cover
with
a
vast
load
of
false
hair
,
which
be
frizzle
on
the
forehead
,
so
as
exactly
to
resemble
the
wooly
head
of
the
Guinea
negro
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
natural
hue
of
it
,
this
be
a
matter
of
no
consequence
,
for
powder
make
every
head
of
hair
of
the
same
colour
;
and
no
woman
appear
in
this
country
,
from
the
moment
she
rise
till
night
,
without
be
compleatly
whiten
.
<EOS>
powder
or
meal
be
first
use
in
Europe
by
the
Poles
,
to
conceal
their
scald
head
;
but
the
present
fashion
of
use
it
,
as
well
as
the
modish
method
of
dress
the
hair
,
must
have
be
borrow
from
the
Hottentots
,
who
grease
their
wooly
head
with
mutton
suet
and
then
paste
it
over
with
the
powder
call
buchu
.
<EOS>
in
like
manner
,
the
hair
of
our
fine
lady
be
frizzle
into
the
appearance
of
negroes
wool
,
and
stiffen
with
an
abominable
paste
of
hog
's
grease
,
tallow
,
and
white
powder
.
<EOS>
the
present
fashion
,
therefore
,
of
paint
the
face
,
and
adorn
the
head
,
adopt
by
the
beau
monde
in
France
,
be
take
from
those
two
polite
nation
the
Chickesaws
of
America
and
the
Hottentots
of
Africa
.
<EOS>
on
the
whole
,
when
I
see
one
of
those
fine
creature
sail
along
,
in
her
taudry
robe
of
silk
and
gauze
,
frille
,
and
flounce
,
and
furbelowe
,
with
her
false
lock
,
her
false
jewel
,
her
paint
,
her
patch
,
and
perfume
;
I
can
not
help
look
upon
her
as
the
vile
piece
of
sophistication
that
art
ever
produce
.
  
<EOS>
this
hideous
masque
of
painting
,
though
destructive
of
all
beauty
,
be
,
however
,
favourable
to
natural
homeliness
and
deformity
.
<EOS>
It
accustom
the
eye
of
the
other
sex
,
and
in
time
reconcile
them
to
frightfull
object
;
it
disable
them
from
perceive
any
distinction
of
feature
between
woman
and
woman
;
and
,
by
reduce
all
face
to
a
level
,
give
every
female
an
equal
chance
for
an
admirer
;
be
in
this
particular
analogous
to
the
practice
of
the
antient
Lacedemonians
,
who
be
oblige
to
chuse
their
helpmate
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
in
what
manner
the
inside
of
their
head
be
furnish
,
I
would
not
presume
to
judge
from
the
conversation
of
a
very
few
to
whom
I
have
have
access
:
but
from
the
nature
of
their
education
,
which
I
have
hear
describe
,
and
the
natural
vivacity
of
their
temper
,
I
should
expect
neither
sense
,
sentiment
,
nor
discretion
.
<EOS>
from
the
nursery
they
be
allow
,
and
even
encourage
,
to
say
every
thing
that
come
uppermost
;
by
which
mean
they
acquire
a
volubility
of
tongue
,
and
a
set
of
phrase
,
which
constitute
what
be
call
polite
conversation
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
they
obtain
an
absolute
conquest
over
all
sense
of
shame
,
or
rather
,
they
avoid
acquire
this
troublesome
sensation
;
for
it
be
certainly
no
innate
idea
.
<EOS>
those
who
have
not
governess
at
home
,
be
send
,
for
a
few
year
,
to
a
convent
,
where
they
lie
in
a
fund
of
superstition
that
serve
them
for
life
:
but
I
never
hear
they
have
the
least
opportunity
of
cultivate
the
mind
,
of
exercise
the
power
of
reason
,
or
of
imbibe
a
taste
for
letter
,
or
any
rational
or
useful
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
after
be
teach
to
prattle
,
to
dance
and
play
at
card
,
they
be
deem
sufficiently
qualified
to
appear
in
the
grand
monde
,
and
to
perform
all
the
duty
of
that
high
rank
and
station
in
life
.
<EOS>
in
mention
card
,
I
ought
to
observe
,
that
they
learn
to
play
not
barely
for
amusement
,
but
also
with
a
view
to
advantage
;
and
,
indeed
,
you
seldom
meet
with
a
native
of
France
,
whether
male
or
female
,
who
be
not
a
compleat
gamester
,
well
verse
in
all
the
subtlety
and
finesse
of
the
art
.
<EOS>
this
be
likewise
the
case
all
over
Italy
.
<EOS>
a
lady
of
a
great
house
in
Piedmont
,
have
four
son
,
make
no
scruple
to
declare
,
that
the
first
shall
represent
the
family
,
the
second
enter
into
the
army
,
the
third
into
the
church
,
and
that
she
will
breed
the
fourth
a
gamester
.
<EOS>
these
noble
adventurer
devote
themselves
in
a
particular
manner
to
the
entertainment
of
traveller
from
our
country
,
because
the
English
be
suppose
to
be
full
of
money
,
rash
,
incautious
,
and
utterly
ignorant
of
play
.
<EOS>
but
such
a
sharp
be
most
dangerous
,
when
he
hunt
in
couple
with
a
female
.
<EOS>
I
have
know
a
french
count
and
his
wife
,
who
find
mean
to
lay
the
most
wary
under
contribution
.
<EOS>
He
be
smooth
,
supple
,
officious
,
and
attentive
:
she
be
young
,
handsome
,
unprincipled
,
and
artful
.
<EOS>
if
the
Englishman
mark
for
prey
be
find
upon
his
guard
against
the
design
of
the
husband
,
then
madam
ply
him
on
the
side
of
gallantry
.
<EOS>
She
display
all
the
attraction
of
her
person
.
<EOS>
She
sing
,
dance
,
ogle
,
sigh
,
compliment
,
and
complain
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
insensible
to
all
her
charm
,
she
flatter
his
vanity
,
and
pique
his
pride
,
by
extoll
the
wealth
and
generosity
of
the
English
;
and
if
he
prove
deaf
to
all
these
insinuation
she
,
as
her
last
stake
,
endeavour
to
interest
his
humanity
and
compassion
.
<EOS>
She
expatiate
,
with
tear
in
her
eye
,
on
the
cruelty
and
indifference
of
her
great
relation
;
represent
that
her
husband
be
no
more
than
the
cadet
of
a
noble
family
  
,
that
his
provision
be
by
no
means
suitable
.
<EOS>
either
to
the
dignity
of
his
rank
,
or
the
generosity
of
his
disposition
:
that
he
have
a
law
-
suit
of
great
consequence
depending
,
which
have
drain
all
his
finance
;
and
,
finally
,
that
they
should
be
both
ruin
,
if
they
could
not
find
some
generous
friend
,
who
would
accommodate
them
with
a
sum
of
money
to
bring
the
cause
to
a
determination
.
<EOS>
those
who
be
not
actuate
by
such
scandalous
motive
,
become
gamester
from
meer
habit
,
and
,
have
nothing
more
solid
to
engage
their
thought
,
or
employ
their
time
,
consume
the
good
part
of
their
life
,
in
this
bad
of
all
dissipation
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
ignorant
that
there
be
exception
from
this
general
rule
:
I
know
that
France
have
produce
a
Maintenon
,
a
Sevigine
,
a
Scuderi
,
a
Dacier
,
and
a
chatelet
;
but
I
would
no
more
deduce
the
general
character
of
the
french
lady
from
these
example
,
than
I
would
call
a
field
of
hemp
a
flower
-
garden
.
<EOS>
because
there
may
be
in
it
a
few
lillie
or
renuncula
plant
by
the
hand
of
accident
.
  
<EOS>
woman
have
be
define
a
weak
man
;
but
in
this
country
the
man
be
,
in
my
opinion
,
more
ridiculous
and
insignificant
than
the
woman
.
<EOS>
They
certainly
be
more
disagreeable
to
a
rational
enquirer
,
because
they
be
more
troublesome
.
<EOS>
of
all
the
coxcomb
on
the
face
of
the
earth
,
a
french
petit
maitre
be
the
most
impertinent
:
and
they
be
all
petit
maitre
from
the
marquis
who
glitter
in
lace
and
embroidery
,
to
the
garcon
barbier
cover
with
meal
,
who
strut
with
his
hair
in
a
long
queue
,
and
his
hat
under
his
arm
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
observe
,
<EOS>
that
vanity
be
the
great
and
universal
mover
among
all
rank
and
degree
of
people
in
this
nation
;
and
as
they
take
no
pain
to
conceal
or
controul
it
,
they
be
hurry
by
it
into
the
most
ridiculous
and
indeed
intolerable
extravagance
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
talk
of
the
french
nation
,
I
must
again
except
a
great
number
of
individual
,
from
the
general
censure
.
<EOS>
though
I
have
a
hearty
contempt
for
the
ignorance
,
folly
,
and
presumption
which
characterise
the
generality
,
I
can
not
but
respect
the
talent
of
many
great
man
,
who
have
eminently
distinguish
themselves
in
every
art
and
science
:
these
I
shall
always
revere
and
esteem
as
creature
of
a
superior
specie
,
produce
,
for
the
wise
purpose
of
providence
,
among
the
refuse
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
absurd
to
conclude
that
the
Welch
or
Highlanders
be
a
gigantic
people
,
because
those
mountain
may
have
produce
a
few
individual
near
seven
foot
high
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
equally
absurd
to
suppose
the
French
be
a
nation
of
philosopher
,
because
France
have
give
birth
to
a
Des
Cartes
,
a
Maupertuis
,
a
Reaumur
,
and
a
Buffon
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
not
even
deny
,
that
the
French
be
by
no
mean
deficient
in
natural
capacity
;
but
they
be
at
the
same
time
remarkable
for
a
natural
levity
,
which
hinder
their
youth
from
cultivate
that
capacity
.
<EOS>
this
be
reinforce
by
the
most
preposterous
education
,
and
the
example
of
a
giddy
people
,
engage
in
the
most
frivolous
pursuit
.
<EOS>
a
Frenchman
be
by
some
Jesuit
,
or
other
monk
,
teach
to
read
his
mother
tongue
,
and
to
say
his
prayer
in
a
language
he
do
not
understand
.
<EOS>
He
learn
to
dance
and
to
fence
,
by
the
master
of
those
noble
science
.
<EOS>
He
become
a
compleat
connoisseur
in
dress
hair
,
and
in
adorn
his
own
person
,
under
the
hand
and
instruction
of
his
barber
and
valet
de
chambre
.
<EOS>
if
he
learn
to
play
upon
the
flute
or
the
fiddle
,
he
be
altogether
irresistible
.
<EOS>
but
he
pique
himself
upon
be
polish
above
the
native
of
any
other
country
by
his
conversation
with
the
fair
sex
.
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
this
communication
,
with
which
he
be
indulge
from
his
tender
year
,
he
learn
like
a
parrot
,
by
rote
,
the
whole
circle
of
french
compliment
,
which
you
know
be
a
set
of
phrase
ridiculous
even
to
a
proverb
;
and
these
he
throw
out
indiscriminately
to
all
woman
,
without
distinction
in
the
exercise
of
that
kind
of
address
,
which
be
here
distinguish
by
the
name
of
gallantry
<EOS>
:
it
be
no
more
than
his
make
love
to
every
woman
who
will
give
him
the
hearing
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
exercise
,
by
the
repetition
of
which
he
become
very
pert
,
very
familiar
,
and
very
impertinent
.
<EOS>
Modesty
,
or
diffidence
,
I
have
already
say
,
be
utterly
unknown
among
them
,
and
therefore
I
wonder
there
should
be
a
term
to
express
it
in
their
language
.
  
<EOS>
if
I
be
oblige
to
define
politeness
,
I
should
call
it
,
the
art
of
make
one
's
self
agreeable
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
an
art
that
necessarily
imply
a
sense
of
decorum
,
and
a
delicacy
of
sentiment
.
<EOS>
these
be
quality
,
of
which
(
as
far
as
I
have
be
able
to
observe
)
<EOS>
a
Frenchman
have
no
idea
;
therefore
he
never
can
be
deem
polite
,
except
by
those
person
among
whom
they
be
as
little
understand
.
<EOS>
His
first
aim
be
to
adorn
his
own
person
with
what
he
call
fine
cloath
,
that
be
the
frippery
of
the
fashion
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
wonder
that
the
heart
of
a
female
,
unimproved
by
reason
,
and
untinctured
with
natural
good
sense
,
should
flutter
at
the
sight
of
such
a
gaudy
thing
,
among
the
number
of
her
admirer
:
<EOS>
this
impression
be
enforce
by
fustian
compliment
,
which
her
own
vanity
interpret
in
a
literal
sense
,
and
still
more
confirm
by
the
assiduous
attention
of
the
gallant
,
who
,
indeed
,
have
nothing
else
to
mind
.
<EOS>
a
Frenchman
in
consequence
of
his
mingling
with
the
female
from
his
infancy
,
not
only
become
acquaint
with
all
their
custom
and
humour
;
but
grow
wonderfully
alert
in
perform
a
thousand
little
office
,
which
be
overlook
by
other
man
,
whose
time
hath
be
spend
in
make
more
valuable
acquisition
.
<EOS>
He
enter
,
without
ceremony
,
a
lady
's
bed
-
chamber
,
while
she
be
in
bed
,
reach
her
whatever
she
want
,
air
her
shift
,
and
help
to
put
it
on
.
<EOS>
He
attend
at
her
toilette
,
regulate
the
distribution
of
her
patch
,
and
advise
where
to
lay
on
the
paint
.
<EOS>
if
he
visit
her
when
she
be
dressed
,
and
perceive
the
least
impropriety
in
her
coeffure
,
he
insist
upon
adjust
it
with
his
own
hand
:
if
he
see
a
curl
,
or
even
a
single
hair
amiss
,
he
produce
his
comb
,
his
scissar
,
and
pomatum
,
and
set
it
to
right
with
the
dexterity
of
a
professed
friseur
.
<EOS>
He
"
squire
her
to
every
place
she
visit
,
either
on
business
,
or
pleasure
;
and
,
by
dedicate
his
whole
time
to
her
,
render
himself
necessary
to
her
occasion
.
<EOS>
this
I
take
to
be
the
most
agreeable
side
of
his
character
:
let
us
view
him
on
the
quarter
of
impertinence
.
<EOS>
a
Frenchman
pry
into
all
your
secret
with
the
most
impudent
and
importunate
curiosity
,
and
then
disclose
them
without
remorse
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
indispose
,
he
question
you
about
the
symptom
of
your
disorder
,
with
more
freedom
than
your
physician
would
presume
to
use
;
very
often
in
the
gross
term
.
<EOS>
He
then
propose
his
remedy
(
for
they
be
all
quack
)
,
he
prepare
it
without
your
knowledge
,
and
worry
you
with
solicitation
to
take
it
,
without
pay
the
least
regard
to
the
opinion
of
those
whom
you
have
choose
to
take
care
of
your
health
.
<EOS>
let
you
be
ever
so
ill
,
or
averse
to
company
,
he
force
himself
at
all
time
into
your
bed
-
chamber
,
and
if
it
be
necessary
to
give
him
a
peremptory
refusal
,
he
be
affront
.
<EOS>
I
have
know
one
of
those
petit
maitre
insist
upon
pay
regular
visit
twice
a
day
to
a
poor
gentleman
who
be
delirious
;
and
he
converse
with
him
on
different
subject
,
till
he
be
in
his
last
agony
.
<EOS>
this
attendance
be
not
the
effect
of
attachment
,
or
regard
,
but
of
sheer
vanity
,
that
he
may
afterwards
boast
of
his
charity
and
humane
disposition
:
<EOS>
though
,
of
all
the
people
I
have
ever
know
,
I
think
the
French
be
the
least
capable
of
feel
for
the
distress
of
their
fellow
creature
.
<EOS>
Their
heart
be
not
susceptible
of
deep
impression
;
and
,
such
be
their
levity
,
that
the
imagination
have
not
time
to
brood
long
over
any
disagreeable
idea
,
or
sensation
.
<EOS>
as
a
Frenchman
pique
himself
on
his
gallantry
,
he
no
sooner
make
a
conquest
of
a
female
's
heart
,
than
he
expose
her
character
,
for
the
gratification
of
his
vanity
.
<EOS>
nay
,
if
he
should
miscarry
in
his
scheme
,
he
will
forge
letter
and
story
,
to
the
ruin
of
the
lady
's
reputation
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
species
of
perfidy
which
one
would
think
should
render
them
odious
and
detestable
to
the
whole
sex
;
but
the
case
be
otherwise
.
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Madam
;
but
woman
be
never
better
pleased
,
than
when
they
see
one
another
expose
;
and
every
individual
have
such
confidence
in
her
own
superior
charm
and
discretion
,
that
she
think
she
can
fix
the
most
volatile
,
and
reform
the
most
treacherous
lover
.
  
<EOS>
if
a
Frenchman
be
admit
into
your
family
,
and
distinguish
by
repeated
mark
of
your
friendship
and
regard
,
the
first
return
he
make
for
your
civility
be
to
make
love
to
your
wife
,
if
she
be
handsome
;
if
not
,
to
your
sister
,
or
daughter
,
or
niece
.
<EOS>
if
he
suffer
a
repulse
from
your
wife
,
or
attempt
in
vain
to
debauch
your
sister
,
or
your
daughter
,
or
your
niece
,
he
will
,
rather
than
not
play
the
traitor
with
his
gallantry
,
make
his
address
to
your
grandmother
;
and
ten
to
one
,
but
in
one
shape
or
another
,
he
will
find
mean
to
ruin
the
peace
of
a
family
,
in
which
he
have
be
so
kindly
entertain
.
<EOS>
what
he
can
not
accomplish
by
dint
of
compliment
,
and
personal
attendance
,
he
will
endeavour
to
effect
,
by
reinforce
these
with
billet
-
doux
,
song
,
and
verse
,
of
which
he
always
make
a
provision
for
such
purpose
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
detect
in
these
effort
of
treachery
,
and
reproach
with
his
ingratitude
,
he
impudently
declare
,
that
what
he
have
do
be
no
more
than
simple
gallantry
,
consider
in
France
as
an
indispensible
duty
on
every
man
who
pretend
to
good
breeding
.
<EOS>
nay
,
he
will
even
affirm
,
that
his
endeavour
to
corrupt
your
wife
,
or
your
daughter
,
be
the
most
genuine
proof
he
could
give
of
his
particular
regard
for
your
family
.
  
<EOS>
if
a
Frenchman
be
capable
of
real
friendship
,
it
must
certainly
be
the
most
disagreeable
present
he
can
possibly
make
to
a
man
of
a
true
english
character
,
You
know
,
Madam
,
we
be
naturally
taciturn
,
soon
tired
of
impertinence
,
and
much
subject
to
fit
of
disgust
.
<EOS>
Your
french
friend
intrude
upon
you
at
all
hour
:
he
stun
you
with
his
loquacity
:
he
tease
you
with
impertinent
question
about
your
domestic
and
private
affair
:
he
attempt
to
meddle
in
all
your
concern
;
and
force
his
advice
upon
you
with
the
most
unwearied
importunity
:
he
ask
the
price
of
every
thing
you
wear
,
and
,
so
sure
as
you
tell
him
undervalue
it
,
without
hesitation
:
he
affirm
it
be
in
a
bad
taste
,
ill
-
contrived
,
ill
-
make
;
that
you
have
be
impose
upon
both
with
respect
to
the
fashion
and
the
price
;
that
the
marquise
of
this
,
or
the
countess
of
that
,
have
one
that
be
perfectly
elegant
,
quite
in
the
bon
ton
,
and
yet
it
cost
her
little
more
than
you
give
for
a
thing
that
nobody
would
wear
.
  
<EOS>
if
there
be
five
hundred
dish
at
table
,
a
Frenchman
will
eat
of
all
of
them
,
and
then
complain
he
have
no
appetite
.
<EOS>
this
I
have
several
time
remark
.
<EOS>
a
friend
of
mine
gain
a
considerable
wager
upon
an
experiment
of
this
kind
:
the
petit
maitre
eat
of
fourteen
different
plat
,
besides
the
dessert
;
then
disparage
the
cook
,
declare
he
be
no
well
than
a
marmiton
,
or
turnspit
.
  
<EOS>
the
French
have
the
most
ridiculous
fondness
for
their
hair
,
and
this
<EOS>
I
believe
they
inherit
from
their
remote
ancestor
.
<EOS>
the
first
race
of
french
king
be
distinguish
by
their
long
hair
,
and
certainly
the
people
of
this
country
consider
it
as
an
indispensible
ornament
.
<EOS>
a
Frenchman
will
sooner
part
with
his
religion
than
with
his
hair
,
which
,
indeed
,
no
consideration
will
induce
him
to
forego
.
<EOS>
I
know
a
gentleman
afflict
with
a
continual
head
-
ach
,
and
a
defluxion
on
his
eye
,
who
be
tell
by
his
physician
that
the
good
chance
he
have
for
be
cure
,
would
be
to
have
his
head
close
shave
,
and
bathe
every
day
in
cold
water
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
how
(
cry
he
)
cut
my
hair
?
<EOS>
Mr
Doctor
,
your
most
humble
servant
!
"
<EOS>
He
dismiss
his
physician
,
lose
his
eye
-
sight
,
and
almost
his
sense
,
and
be
now
lead
about
with
his
hair
in
a
bag
,
and
a
piece
of
green
silk
hang
like
a
screen
before
his
face
.
<EOS>
Count
Saxe
,
and
other
military
writer
have
demonstrate
the
absurdity
of
a
soldier
's
wear
a
long
head
of
hair
;
nevertheless
,
every
soldier
in
this
country
wear
a
long
queue
,
which
make
a
delicate
mark
on
his
white
cloathing
;
and
this
ridiculous
foppery
have
descend
even
to
the
low
class
of
people
.
<EOS>
the
decrotteur
,
who
clean
your
shoe
at
the
corner
of
the
Pont
Neuf
,
have
a
tail
of
this
kind
hang
down
to
his
rump
,
and
even
the
peasant
who
drive
an
ass
load
with
dung
,
wear
his
hair
en
queue
,
though
,
perhaps
,
he
have
neither
shirt
nor
breech
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
ornament
upon
which
he
bestow
much
time
and
pain
,
and
in
the
exhibition
of
which
he
find
full
gratification
for
his
vanity
.
<EOS>
consider
the
harsh
feature
of
the
common
people
in
this
country
,
their
diminutive
stature
,
their
grimace
,
and
that
long
appendage
,
they
have
no
small
resemblance
to
large
baboon
walk
upright
;
and
perhaps
this
similitude
have
help
to
entail
upon
them
the
ridicule
of
their
neighbour
.
  
<EOS>
a
french
friend
tire
out
your
patience
with
long
visit
;
and
,
far
from
take
the
most
palpable
hint
to
withdraw
,
when
he
perceive
you
uneasy
<EOS>
he
observe
you
be
low
-
spirited
,
and
therefore
he
will
keep
you
company
.
<EOS>
this
perseverance
shew
that
he
must
either
be
void
of
penetration
,
or
that
his
disposition
must
be
truly
diabolical
.
<EOS>
rather
than
be
torment
with
such
a
fiend
,
a
man
have
better
turn
him
out
of
door
,
even
though
at
the
hazard
of
be
run
thro
'
the
body
.
  
<EOS>
the
French
be
generally
count
insincere
,
and
tax
with
want
of
generosity
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
these
reproach
be
not
well
found
.
<EOS>
high
-
fly
profession
of
friendship
and
attachment
constitute
the
language
of
common
compliment
in
this
country
,
and
be
never
suppose
to
be
understand
in
the
literal
acceptation
of
the
word
;
and
,
if
their
act
of
generosity
be
but
very
rare
,
we
ought
to
ascribe
that
rarity
,
not
so
much
to
a
deficiency
of
generous
sentiment
,
as
to
their
vanity
and
ostentation
,
which
engross
all
their
fund
,
utterly
disable
them
from
exert
the
virtue
of
beneficence
.
<EOS>
vanity
,
indeed
,
predominate
among
all
rank
,
to
such
a
degree
,
that
they
be
the
great
egotist
in
the
world
;
and
the
most
insignificant
individual
talk
in
company
with
the
same
conceit
and
arrogance
,
as
a
person
of
the
great
importance
.
<EOS>
neither
conscious
poverty
nor
disgrace
will
restrain
him
in
the
least
either
from
assume
his
full
share
of
the
conversation
,
or
make
big
address
to
the
fine
lady
,
whom
he
have
the
small
opportunity
to
approach
:
nor
be
he
restrain
by
any
other
consideration
whatsoever
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
one
to
him
whether
he
himself
have
a
wife
of
his
own
,
or
the
lady
a
husband
;
whether
she
be
design
for
the
cloister
,
or
pre
-
ingaged
to
his
good
friend
and
benefactor
.
<EOS>
He
take
it
for
grant
that
his
address
can
not
but
be
acceptable
;
and
,
if
he
meet
with
a
repulse
,
he
condemn
her
taste
;
but
never
doubt
his
own
qualification
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
many
thing
to
say
of
their
military
character
,
and
their
punctilio
of
honour
,
which
last
be
equally
absurd
and
pernicious

as
this

run
to
an
unconscionable

defer
them

<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
I
be
favour
with
yours
at
Paris
,
and
look
upon
your
reproach
as
the
proof
of
your
friendship
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
I
consider
all
the
letter
I
have
hitherto
write
on
the
subject
of
my
travel
,
as
write
to
your
society
in
general
,
though
they
have
be
address
to
one
individual
of
it
;
and
if
they
contain
any
thing
that
can
either
amuse
or
inform
,
I
desire
that
henceforth
all
I
send
may
be
freely
peruse
by
all
the
member
.
  
<EOS>
with
respect
to
my
health
,
about
which
you
so
kindly
enquire
,
I
have
nothing
new
to
communicate
.
<EOS>
I
have
reason
to
think
that
my
bathing
in
the
sea
at
Boulogne
 
produce
a
good
effect
,
in
strengthen
my
relaxed
fibre
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
subject
I
be
to
cold
in
England
;
that
I
could
not
stir
abroad
after
sun
-
set
,
nor
expose
myself
to
the
small
damp
,
nor
walk
till
the
least
moisture
appear
on
my
skin
,
without
be
lay
up
for
ten
day
or
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
at
Paris
,
however
,
I
go
out
every
day
,
with
my
hat
under
my
arm
,
though
the
weather
be
wet
and
cold
:
I
walk
in
the
garden
at
Versailles
even
after
it
be
dark
,
with
my
head
uncover
,
on
a
cold
evening
,
when
the
ground
be
far
from
be
dry
:
<EOS>
nay
,
at
Marli
,
I
saunter
above
a
mile
through
damp
alley
,
and
wet
grass
:
<EOS>
and
from
none
of
these
risque
do
I
feel
the
least
inconvenience
.
  
<EOS>
in
one
of
our
excursion
we
visit
the
manufacture
for
porcelain
,
which
the
king
of
France
have
establish
at
the
village
of
St
Cloud
,
on
the
road
to
Versailles
,
and
which
be
,
indeed
,
a
noble
monument
of
his
munificence
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
large
building
,
both
commodious
and
magnificent
,
where
a
great
number
of
artist
be
employ
,
and
where
this
elegant
superfluity
be
carry
to
as
great
perfection
as
it
ever
be
at
Dresden
.
<EOS>
yet
,
after
all
,
I
know
not
whether
the
porcelain
make
at
Chelsea
may
not
vie
with
the
production
either
of
Dresden
,
or
St
Cloud
.
<EOS>
if
it
fall
short
of
either
,
it
be
not
in
the
design
,
painting
,
enamel
,
or
other
ornament
,
but
only
in
the
composition
of
the
metal
,
and
the
method
of
manage
it
in
the
furnace
.
<EOS>
Our
porcelain
seem
to
be
a
partial
vitrification
of
levigate
flint
and
fine
pipe
clay
,
mix
together
in
a
certain
proportion
;
and
if
the
piece
be
not
remove
from
the
fire
in
the
very
critical
moment
,
they
will
be
either
too
little
,
or
too
much
vitrified
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
case
,
I
apprehend
they
will
not
acquire
a
proper
degree
of
cohesion
;
they
will
be
apt
to
be
corrode
,
discolour
,
and
to
crumble
,
like
the
first
essay
that
be
make
at
Chelsea
;
in
the
second
case
,
they
will
be
little
well
than
imperfect
glass
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
three
method
of
travel
from
Paris
to
Lyons
,
which
,
by
the
short
road
be
a
journey
of
about
three
hundred
and
sixty
mile
.
<EOS>
one
be
by
the
diligence
,
or
stagecoach
,
which
perform
it
in
five
day
;
and
every
passenger
pay
one
hundred
livre
,
in
consideration
of
which
,
he
not
only
have
a
seat
in
the
carriage
,
but
be
maintain
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
the
inconvenience
attend
this
way
of
travel
be
these
.
<EOS>
You
be
croude
into
the
carriage
,
to
the
number
of
eight
person
,
so
as
to
sit
very
uneasy
,
and
sometimes
run
the
risque
of
be
stifle
among
very
indifferent
company
.
<EOS>
You
be
hurry
out
of
bed
,
at
four
,
three
,
nay
often
at
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
You
be
oblige
to
eat
in
the
french
way
,
which
be
very
disagreeable
to
an
english
palate
;
and
,
at
chalon
,
you
must
embark
upon
the
Saone
in
a
boat
,
which
convey
you
to
Lyons
,
so
that
the
two
last
day
of
your
journey
be
by
water
.
<EOS>
all
these
be
insurmountable
objection
to
me
,
who
be
in
such
a
bad
state
of
health
,
trouble
with
an
asthmatic
cough
,
spitting
,
slow
fever
,
and
restlessness
,
which
demand
a
continual
change
of
place
,
as
well
as
free
air
,
and
room

<EOS>
I
be
this
day
visit
by
two
young
gentleman
,
son
of
Mr
Guastaldi
,
late
minister
from
Genoa
at
London
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
them
at
Paris
,
at
the
house
of
the
dutchess
of
Douglas
.
<EOS>
They
come
hither
,
with
their
conductor
,
in
the
diligence
,
and
assure
me
,
that
nothing
could
be
more
disagreeable
than
their
situation
in
that
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
another
way
of
travel
in
this
country
be
to
hire
a
coach
and
four
horse
;
and
this
method
I
be
inclined
to
take
:
but
when
I
go
to
the
bureau
,
where
alone
these
voiture
be
to
be
have
,
I
be
give
to
understand
,
that
it
would
cost
me
six
-
and
-
twenty
guinea
,
and
travel
so
slow
that
I
should
be
ten
day
upon
the
road
.
<EOS>
these
carriage
be
let
by
the
same
person
who
farm
the
diligence
;
and
for
this
they
have
an
exclusive
privilege
,
which
make
them
very
saucy
and
insolent
.
<EOS>
when
I
mention
my
servant
,
they
give
me
to
understand
,
that
I
must
pay
two
loui'dore
more
for
his
seat
upon
the
coach
box
.
<EOS>
as
I
could
not
relish
these
term
,
nor
brook
the
thought
of
be
so
long
upon
the
road
,
I
have
recourse
to
the
third
method
,
which
be
go
post
.
  
<EOS>
in
England
you
know
I
should
have
have
nothing
to
do
,
but
to
hire
a
couple
of
post
-
chaise
from
stage
to
stage
,
with
two
horse
in
each
;
but
here
the
case
be
quite
otherwise
.
<EOS>
the
post
be
farm
from
the
king
,
who
lay
traveller
under
contribution
for
his
own
benefit
,
and
have
publish
a
set
of
oppressive
ordonnance
,
which
no
strange
nor
native
dare
transgress
.
<EOS>
the
postmaster
find
nothing
but
horse
and
guide
:
the
carriage
you
yourself
must
provide
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
four
person
within
the
carriage
,
you
be
oblige
to
have
six
horse
,
and
two
postillion
;
and
if
your
servant
sit
on
the
outside
,
either
before
or
behind
,
you
must
pay
for
a
seventh
.
<EOS>
You
pay
double
for
the
first
stage
from
Paris
,
and
twice
double
for
pass
through
Fontainbleau
when
the
court
be
there
,
as
well
as
at
come
to
Lyons
,
and
at
leave
this
city
.
<EOS>
these
be
call
royal
post
,
and
be
undoubtedly
a
scandalous
imposition
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
two
post
road
from
Paris
to
Lyons
,
one
of
sixty
-
five
post
,
by
the
way
of
Moulins
;
the
other
of
fifty
-
nine
,
by
the
way
of
Dijon
in
Burgundy
.
<EOS>
this
last
I
choose
,
partly
to
save
sixty
livre
,
and
partly
to
see
the
wine
harvest
of
Burgundy
,
which
,
I
be
tell
,
be
a
season
of
mirth
and
jollity
among
all
rank
of
people
.
<EOS>
I
hire
a
very
good
coach
for
ten
loui'dore
to
Lyons
,
and
set
out
from
Paris
on
the
thirteenth
instant
,
with
six
horse
,
two
postillion
,
and
my
own
servant
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
We
make
no
stop
at
Fontainbleau
,
though
the
court
be
there
;
but
lie
at
Moret
,
which
be
one
stage
further
,
a
very
paltry
little
town
<EOS>
where
,
however
,
we
find
good
accommodation
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
not
pretend
to
describe
the
castle
or
palace
of
Fontainbleau
,
of
which
I
have
only
a
glimpse
in
passing
;
but
the
forest
,
in
the
middle
of
which
it
stand
,
be
a
noble
chace
of
great
extent
,
beautifully
wild
and
romantic
,
well
store
with
game
of
all
sort
,
and
abound
with
excellent
timber
.
<EOS>
It
put
me
in
mind
of
the
New
Forest
in
Hampshire
;
but
the
hill
,
rock
,
and
mountain
,
with
which
it
be
diversify
,
render
it
more
agreeable
.
  
<EOS>
the
people
of
this
country
dine
at
noon
,
and
traveller
always
find
an
ordinary
prepared
at
every
auberge
,
or
public
-
house
,
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
here
they
sit
down
promiscuously
,
and
dine
at
so
much
a
head
.
<EOS>
the
usual
price
be
thirty
sol
for
dinner
,
and
forty
for
supper
,
include
lodging
;
for
this
moderate
expence
they
have
two
course
and
a
dessert
.
<EOS>
if
you
eat
in
your
own
apartment
,
you
pay
,
instead
of
forty
sol
,
three
,
and
in
some
place
,
four
livre
ahead
.
<EOS>
I
and
my
family
could
not
well
dispense
with
our
tea
and
toast
in
the
morning
,
and
have
no
stomach
to
eat
at
noon
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
hate
french
cookery
,
and
abominate
garlick
,
with
which
all
their
ragout
,
in
this
part
of
the
country
,
be
highly
season
:
we
therefore
form
a
different
plan
of
live
upon
the
road
.
<EOS>
before
we
leave
Paris
,
we
lay
in
a
stock
of
tea
,
chocolate
,
cure
neat
'
tongue
,
and
saucisson
,
or
Bologna
sausage
,
both
of
which
we
find
in
great
perfection
in
that
capital
,
where
,
indeed
,
there
be
excellent
provision
of
all
sort
.
<EOS>
about
ten
in
the
morning
we
stop
to
breakfast
at
some
auberge
,
where
we
always
find
bread
,
butter
,
and
milk
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
we
order
a
poulard
or
two
to
be
roast
,
and
these
,
wrap
in
a
napkin
,
be
put
into
the
boot
of
the
coach
,
together
with
bread
,
wine
,
and
water
.
<EOS>
about
two
or
three
in
the
afternoon
,
while
the
horse
be
change
,
we
lay
a
cloth
upon
our
knee
,
and
produce
our
store
,
with
a
few
earthen
plate
,
discuss
our
short
meal
without
further
ceremony
.
<EOS>
this
be
follow
by
a
dessert
of
grape
and
other
fruit
,
which
we
have
also
provide
.
<EOS>
I
must
own
<EOS>
I
find
these
transient
refreshment
much
more
agreeable
than
any
regular
meal
I
eat
upon
the
road
.
<EOS>
the
wine
commonly
use
in
Burgundy
be
so
weak
and
thin
,
that
you
would
not
drink
it
in
England
.
<EOS>
the
very
good
which
they
sell
at
Dijon
,
the
capital
of
the
province
,
for
three
livre
a
bottle
,
be
in
strength
,
and
even
in
flavour
,
greatly
inferior
to
what
I
have
drink
in
London
.
<EOS>
I
believe
all
the
first
growth
be
either
consume
in
the
house
of
the
noblesse
,
or
send
abroad
to
foreign
market
.
<EOS>
I
have
drink
excellent
Burgundy
at
Brussels
for
a
florin
a
bottle
;
that
is
,
little
more
than
twenty
pence
sterling
.
  
<EOS>
the
country
from
the
forest
of
Fontainbleau
to
the
Lyonnois
,
through
which
we
pass
,
be
rather
agreeable
than
fertile
,
be
part
of
Champagne
and
the
dutchy
of
Burgundy
,
water
by
three
pleasant
pastoral
river
,
the
Seine
,
the
Yonne
,
and
the
Saone
.
<EOS>
the
flat
country
be
lay
out
chiefly
for
corn
;
but
produce
more
rye
than
wheat
.
<EOS>
almost
all
the
ground
seem
to
be
plough
up
,
so
that
there
be
little
or
nothing
lie
fallow
.
<EOS>
there
be
very
few
inclosure
,
scarce
any
meadow
ground
,
and
,
so
far
as
I
could
observe
,
a
great
scarcity
of
cattle
.
<EOS>
We
sometimes
find
it
very
difficult
 
to
procure
half
a
pint
of
milk
for
our
tea
.
<EOS>
in
Burgundy
I
see
a
peasant
plough
the
ground
with
a
jack
-
ass
,
a
lean
cow
,
and
a
he
-
goat
,
yoke
together
.
<EOS>
It
be
generally
observe
,
that
a
great
number
of
black
cattle
be
breed
and
feed
on
the
mountain
of
Burgundy
,
which
be
the
high
land
in
France
;
but
I
see
very
few
.
<EOS>
the
peasant
in
France
be
so
wretchedly
poor
,
and
so
much
oppress
by
their
landlord
,
that
they
can
not
afford
to
inclose
their
ground
,
or
give
a
proper
respite
to
their
land
;
or
to
stock
their
farm
with
a
sufficient
number
of
black
cattle
to
produce
the
necessary
manure
,
without
which
agriculture
can
never
be
carry
to
any
degree
of
perfection
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
whatever
effort
a
few
individual
may
make
for
the
benefit
of
their
own
estate
,
husbandry
in
France
will
never
be
generally
improve
,
until
the
farmer
be
free
and
independent
.
  
<EOS>
from
the
frequency
of
town
and
village
,
I
should
imagine
this
country
be
very
populous
;
yet
it
must
be
own
,
that
the
town
be
in
general
thinly
inhabit
.
<EOS>
I
see
a
good
number
of
country
seat
and
plantation
near
tile
bank
of
the
river
,
on
each
side
;
and
a
great
many
convent
,
sweetly
situate
,
on
rise
ground
,
where
the
air
be
most
pure
,
and
the
prospect
most
agreeable
.
<EOS>
It
be
surprising
to
see
how
happy
the
founder
of
those
religious
house
have
be
in
their
choice
of
situation
,
all
the
world
over
.
  
<EOS>
in
pass
through
this
country
,
I
be
very
much
strike
with
the
sight
of
large
ripe
cluster
of
grape
,
entwine
with
the
briar
and
thorn
of
common
hedge
on
the
wayside
.
<EOS>
the
mountain
of
Burgundy
be
cover
with
vine
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
,
and
seem
to
be
raise
by
nature
on
purpose
to
extend
the
surface
,
and
to
expose
it
the
more
advantageously
to
the
ray
of
the
sun
.
<EOS>
the
vandange
be
but
just
begin
,
and
the
people
be
employ
in
gather
the
grape
;
but
I
see
no
sign
of
festivity
among
them
.
<EOS>
perhaps
their
joy
be
a
little
damp
by
the
bad
prospect
of
their
harvest
;
for
they
complain
that
the
weather
have
be
so
unfavourable
as
to
hinder
the
grape
from
ripen
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
indeed
,
there
be
something
uncomfortable
in
see
the
vintage
thus
retard
till
the
beginning
of
winter
:
for
,
in
some
part
,
I
find
the
weather
extremely
cold
;
particularly
at
a
place
call
Maison
-
neuve
,
where
we
lay
,
there
be
a
hard
frost
,
and
in
the
morning
the
pool
be
cover
with
a
thick
crust
of
ice
.
<EOS>
My
personal
adventure
on
the
road
be
such
as
will
not
bear
a
recital
.
<EOS>
They
consist
of
petty
dispute
with
landlady
,
post-
master
,
and
postillion
.
<EOS>
the
highway
seem
to
be
perfectly
safe
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
find
that
any
robbery
be
ever
commit
,
although
we
do
not
see
one
of
the
marechaussee
from
Paris
to
Lyons
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
marechaussee
be
a
body
of
trooper
<EOS>
well
mount
,
maintain
in
France
as
safe
-
guard
to
the
public
road
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
reproach
upon
England
that
some
such
patrol
be
not
appoint
for
the
protection
of
traveller
.
  
<EOS>
at
Sens
in
Champagne
,
my
servant
,
who
have
ride
on
before
to
bespeak
fresh
horse
,
tell
me
,
that
the
domestic
of
another
company
have
be
provide
before
him
,
altho
'
<EOS>
it
be
not
his
turn
,
as
he
have
arrive
later
at
the
post
.
<EOS>
provoke
at
this
partiality
,
I
resolve
to
chide
the
post
-
master
,
and
accordingly
address
myself
to
a
person
who
stand
at
the
door
of
the
auberge
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
jolly
figure
,
fat
and
fair
,
dress
in
an
odd
kind
of
garb
,
with
a
gold
laced
cap
on
his
head
,
and
a
cambric
handkerchief
pin
to
his
middle
.
<EOS>
the
sight
of
such
a
fantastic
petit
maitre
,
in
the
character
of
a
post
-
master
,
increase
my
spleen
.
<EOS>
I
call
to
him
with
an
air
of
authority
,
mix
with
indignation
,
and
when
he
come
up
to
the
coach
,
ask
in
a
peremptory
tone
,
if
he
do
not
understand
the
king
's
ordonnance
concern
the
regulation
of
the
post
?
<EOS>
He
lay
his
hand
upon
his
breast
;
but
before
he
could
make
any
answer
,
I
pull
out
the
post
-
book
,
and
begin
to
read
,
with
great
vociferation
,
the
article
which
order
,
that
the
traveller
who
come
first
shall
be
first
serve
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
the
fresh
horse
be
put
to
the
carriage
,
and
the
postillion
mount
,
the
coach
set
off
all
of
a
sudden
,
with
uncommon
speed
.
<EOS>
I
imagine
the
post
-
master
have
give
the
fellow
a
signal
to
be
go
,
and
,
in
this
persuasion
,
thrust
my
head
out
at
the
window
,
I
bestow
some
epithet
upon
him
,
which
must
have
sound
very
harsh
in
the
ear
of
a
Frenchman
.
<EOS>
We
stop
for
a
refreshment
at
a
little
town
call
Joigne
-
ville
,
where
(
by
the
bye
)
I
be
scandalously
impose
upon
,
and
even
abuse
by
a
virago
of
a
landlady
;
then
proceed
to
the
next
stage
,
I
be
give
to
understand
we
could
not
be
supply
with
fresh
horse
.
<EOS>
here
I
perceive
at
the
door
of
the
inn
,
the
same
person
whom
I
have
reproach
at
Sens
.
<EOS>
He
come
up
to
the
coach
,
and
tell
me
,
that
notwithstanding
what
the
guide
have
say
,
I
should
have
fresh
horse
in
a
few
minute
.
<EOS>
I
imagine
he
be
master
both
of
this
house
and
the
auberge
at
Sens
,
between
which
he
pass
and
repasse
occasionally
;
and
that
he
be
now
desirous
of
make
me
amend
for
the
affront
he
have
put
upon
me
at
the
other
place
.
<EOS>
observe
that
one
of
the
trunk
behind
be
a
little
displaced
,
he
assist
my
servant
in
adjust
it
:
then
he
enter
into
conversation
with
me
,
and
give
me
to
understand
,
that
in
a
post
-
chaise
,
which
we
have
pass
,
be
an
english
gentleman
on
his
return
from
Italy
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
who
he
be
,
and
when
he
say
he
could
not
tell
,
I
ask
him
,
in
a
very
abrupt
manner
,
why
he
have
not
enquire
of
his
servant
.
<EOS>
He
shrug
up
his
shoulder
,
and
retire
to
the
inn
door
.
<EOS>
have
wait
about
half
an
hour
,
I
beckon
to
him
,
and
when
he
approach
,
upbraid
him
with
have
tell
me
that
I
should
be
supply
with
fresh
horse
in
a
few
minute
:
he
seem
shocked
,
and
answer
,
that
he
think
he
have
reason
for
what
he
say
,
observe
,
that
it
be
as
disagreeable
to
him
as
to
me
to
wait
for
a
relay
.
<EOS>
as
it
begin
to
rain
,
I
pull
up
the
glass
in
his
face
,
and
he
withdraw
again
to
the
door
,
seemingly
ruffle
at
my
deportment
.
<EOS>
in
a
little
time
the
horse
arrive
,
and
three
of
them
be
immediately
put
to
a
very
handsome
post
-
chaise
,
into
which
he
step
,
and
set
out
,
accompany
by
a
man
in
a
rich
livery
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
astonish
at
this
circumstance
,
I
ask
the
hostler
who
he
be
,
and
he
reply
,
that
he
be
a
man
of
fashion
(
un
seigneur
)
who
live
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Auxerre
.
<EOS>
I
be
much
mortify
to
find
that
I
have
treat
a
nobleman
so
scurvily
,
and
scold
my
own
people
for
not
have
more
penetration
than
myself
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
do
not
fail
to
descant
upon
the
brutal
behaviour
of
the
Englishman
;
and
that
my
mistake
serve
with
him
to
confirm
the
national
reproach
of
bluntness
,
and
ill
breeding
,
under
which
we
lie
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
I
be
that
day
more
than
usually
peevish
,
from
the
bad
weather
,
as
well
as
from
the
dread
of
a
fit
of
the
asthma
,
with
which
I
be
threaten
:
and
I
dare
say
my
appearance
seem
as
uncouth
to
him
,
as
his
travel
dress
appear
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
grey
mourning
frock
under
a
wide
great
coat
,
a
bob
wig
without
powder
,
a
very
large
laced
hat
,
and
a
meagre
,
wrinkle
,
discontent
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
the
fourth
night
of
our
journey
we
lie
at
Macon
,
and
the
next
day
pass
through
the
Lyonnois
,
which
be
a
fine
country
,
full
of
town
,
village
,
and
gentleman
's
house
.
<EOS>
in
pass
through
the
Maconnois
,
we
see
a
great
many
field
of
indian
corn
,
which
grow
to
the
height
of
six
or
seven
foot
:
it
be
make
into
flour
for
the
use
of
the
common
people
,
and
go
by
the
name
of
Turkey
wheat
.
<EOS>
here
likewise
,
as
well
as
in
Dauphine
,
they
raise
a
vast
quantity
of
very
large
pompion
,
with
the
content
of
which
they
thicken
their
soup
and
ragout
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
travel
only
while
the
sun
be
up
,
on
account
of
my
ill
health
,
and
the
post
horse
in
France
be
in
bad
order
,
we
seldom
exceed
twenty
league
a
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
direct
to
a
lodging
-
house
at
Lyons
,
which
be
full
they
shew
us
to
a
tavern
,
where
I
be
lead
up
three
pair
of
stair
,
to
an
apartment
consist
of
three
paltry
chamber
,
for
which
the
people
demand
twelve
livre
a
day
:
for
dinner
and
supper
they
ask
thirty
-
two
,
besides
three
livre
for
my
servant
;
so
that
my
daily
expence
would
have
amount
to
about
forty
-
seven
livre
,
exclusive
of
breakfast
and
coffee
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
provoke
at
this
extortion
,
that
,
without
answer
one
word
,
I
drive
to
another
auberge
,
where
I
now
be
,
and
pay
at
the
rate
of
two
-
and
-
thirty
livre
a
day
,
for
which
I
be
very
badly
lodge
,
and
but
very
indifferently
entertain
.
<EOS>
I
mention
these
circumstance
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
imposition
to
which
stranger
be
subject
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
own
,
however
,
that
in
the
article
of
eat
,
I
may
save
half
the
money
by
go
to
the
public
ordinary
;
but
this
be
a
scheme
of
oeconomy
,
which
(
exclusive
of
other
disagreeable
circumstance
)
neither
my
own
health
,
nor
that
of
my
wife
permit
me
to
embrace
.
<EOS>
My
journey
from
Paris
to
Lyons
,
include
the
hire
of
the
coach
,
and
all
expence
on
the
road
,
have
cost
me
,
within
a
few
shilling
,
forty
loui'dore
.
<EOS>
from
Paris
our
baggage
(
though
not
plombe
)
be
not

examine
till
we
arrive
in
this
city
,
at
the
gate
of
which
we
be
question
by
one
of
the
searcher
,
who
,
be
tipt
with
half
a
crown
,
allow
us
to
proceed
without
further
enquiry
,
  
<EOS>
I
purpose
to
stay
in
lyon
until
I
should
receive
some
letter
I
expect
from
London
,
to
be
forward
by
my
banker
at
Paris
:
but
the
enormous
expence
of
living
in
this
manner
have
determine
me
to
set
out
in
a
day
or
two
for
Montpellier
,
although
that
place
be
a
good
way
out
of
the

My

MONTPELLIER
,
November

,
1763
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
the
city
of
Lyons
have
be
so
often
and
so
circumstantially
describe
,
that
I
can
not
pretend
to
say
any
thing
new
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
know
very
little
of
it
,
but
what
I
have
read
in
book
;
as
I
have
but
one
day
to
make
a
tour
of
the
street
,
square
,
and
other
remarkable
place
.
<EOS>
the
bridge
over
the
Rhone
seem
to
be
so
slightly
build
,
that
I
should
imagine
it
would
be
one
day
carry
away
by
that
rapid
river
;
especially
as
the
arch
be
so
small
,
that
,
after
great
rain
they
be
sometimes
bouchee
,
or
stop
up
;
that
is
,
they
do
not
admit
a
sufficient
passage
for
the
encreased
body
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
in
order
to
remedy
this
dangerous
defect
,
in
some
measure
,
they
find
an
artist
some
year
ago
,
who
have
remove
a
middle
pier
,
and
throw
two
arch
into
one
.
<EOS>
this
alteration
they
look
upon
as
a
masterpiece
in
architecture
,
though
there
be
many
a
common
mason
in
England
,
who
would
have
undertake
and
perform
the
work
,
without
value
himself
much
upon
the
enterprize
.
<EOS>
this
bridge
,
as
well
as
that
of
St
Esprit
,
be
build
,
not
in
a
strait
line
across
the
river
,
but
with
a
curve
,
which
form
a
convexity
to
oppose
the
current
.
<EOS>
such
a
bend
be
certainly
calculate
for
the
well
resist
the
general
impetuosity
of
the
stream
,
and
have
no
bad
effect
to
the
eye
.
  
<EOS>
lyon
be
a
great
,
populous
,
and
flourish
city
but
I
be
surprised
to
find
it
be
count
a
healthy
place
,
and
that
the
air
of
it
be
esteem
favourable
to
pulmonic
disorder
.
<EOS>
It
be
situate
on
the
confluence
of
two
large
river
,
from
which
there
must
be
a
great
evaporation
,
as
well
as
from
the
low
marshy
ground
,
which
these
river
often
overflow
.
<EOS>
this
must
render
the
air
moist
,
frouzy
,
and
even
putrid
,
if
it
be
not
well
ventilate
by
wind
from
the
mountain
of
Swisserland
;
and
in
the
latter
end
of
autumn
,
it
must
be
subject
to
fog
.
<EOS>
the
morning
we
set
out
from
thence
,
the
whole
city
and
adjacent
plain
be
cover
with
so
thick
a
fog
,
that
we
could
not
distinguish
from
the
coach
the
head
of
the
foremost
mule
that
draw
it
.
<EOS>
lyon
be
say
to
be
very
hot
in
summer
,
and
very
cold
in
winter
;
therefore
I
imagine
must
abound
with
inflammatory
and
intermittent
disorder
in
the
spring
and
fall
of
the
year
.
  
<EOS>
My
reason
for
go
to
Montpellier
,
which
be
out
of
the
strait
road
to
Nice
,
be
these
.
<EOS>
have
no
acquaintance
nor
correspondent
in
the
South
of
France
,
I
have
desire
my
credit
may
be
send
to
the
same
house
to
which
my
heavy
baggage
be
consign
.
<EOS>
I
expect
to
find
my
baggage
at
Cette
,
which
be
the
sea
-
port
of
Montpellier
;
and
there
I
also
hope
to
find
a
vessel
,
in
which
I
may
be
transport
by
sea
to
Nice
,
without
further
trouble
.
<EOS>
I
long
to
try
what
effect
the
boasted
air
of
Montpellier
would
have
upon
my
constitution
;
and
I
have
a
great
desire
to
see
the
famous
monument
of
antiquity
in
and
about
the
ancient
city
of
Nismes
,
which
be
about
eight
league
short
of
Montpellier
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
inn
where
we
lodge
,
I
find
a
return
berline
,
belong
to
Avignon
,
with
three
mule
,
which
be
the
animal
commonly
use
for
carriage
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
this
I
hire
for
five
loui'dore
.
<EOS>
the
coach
be
large
,
commodious
,
and
well
-
fit
;
the
mule
be
strong
and
in
good
order
;
and
the
driver
,
whose
name
be
Joseph
,
appear
to
be
a
sober
,
sagacious
,
intelligent
fellow
,
perfectly
well
acquaint
with
every
place
in
the
South
of
France
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
be
owner
of
the
coach
,
but
I
afterwards
learn
,
he
be
no
other
than
a
hire
servant
.
<EOS>
I
likewise
detect
him
in
some
knavery
,
in
the
course
of
our
journey
;
and
plainly
perceive
he
have
a
fellow
-
feeling
with
the
inn
-
keepers
on
the
road
;
but
,
in
other
respect
,
he
be
very
obliging
,
serviceable
,
and
even
entertaining
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
knavish
practice
of
this
kind
,
at
which
a
traveller
will
do
well
to
shut
his
eye
,
for
his
own
ease
and
convenience
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
lucky
if
he
have
to
do
with
a
sensible
knave
,
like
Joseph
,
who
understand
his
interest
too
well
to
be
guilty
of
very
flagrant
piece
of
imposition
.
  
<EOS>
a
man
,
impatient
to
be
at
his
journey
's
end
,
will
find
this
a
most
disagreeable
way
of
travel
.
<EOS>
in
summer
it
must
be
quite
intolerable
.
<EOS>
the
mule
be
very
sure
,
but
very
slow
.
<EOS>
the
journey
seldom
exceed
eight
league
,
about
four
and
twenty
mile
a
day
:
and
as
those
people
have
certain
fix
stage
,
you
be
sometimes
oblige
to
rise
in
a
morning
before
day
;
a
circumstance
very
grievous
to
person
in
ill
health
.
<EOS>
these
inconvenience
,
however
,
be
over
-
balance
by
other
agreemen
.
<EOS>
We
no
,
sooner
quit
Lyons
,
than
we
get
into
summer
weather
,
and
travel
through
a
most
romantic
country
,
along
the
bank
of
the
Rhone
,
have
opportunity
(
from
the
slowness
of
our
pace
)
to
contemplate
its
beauty
at
leisure
.
  
<EOS>
the
rapidity
of
the
Rhone
be
,
in
a
great
measure
,
owe
to
its
be
confine
within
steep
bank
on
each
side
.
<EOS>
these
be
form
almost
through
its
whole
course
,
by
a
double
chain
of
mountain
,
which
rise
with
all
abrupt
ascent
from
both
bank
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
the
mountain
be
cover
with
vineyard
,
intersperse
with
small
summer
-
house
,
and
in
many
place
they
be
crown
with
church
,
chapel
,
and
convent
,
which
add
greatly
to
the
romantic
beauty
of
the
prospect
.
<EOS>
the
highroad
,
as
far
as
Avignon
,
lie
along
the
side
of
the
river
,
which
run
almost
in
a
straight
line
,
and
afford
great
convenience
for
inland
commerce
.
<EOS>
traveller
,
bind
to
the
southern
part
of
France
,
generally
embark
in
the
diligence
at
Lyons
,
and
glide
down
this
river
with
great
velocity
,
pass
a
great
number
of
town
and
village
on
each
side
,
where
they
find
ordinary
every
day
at
dinner
and
supper
.
<EOS>
in
good
weather
,
there
be
no
danger
in
this
method
of
travelling
,
 
'
till
you
come
to
the
Pont
St
Esprit
,
where
the
stream
run
through
the
arch
with
such
rapidity
,
that
the
boat
be
sometimes
overset
.
<EOS>
but
those
passenger
who
be
under
any
apprehension
be
land
above
-
bridge
,
and
take
in
again
,
after
the
boat
have
pass
,
just
in
the
same
manner
as
at
London
Bridge
.
<EOS>
the
boat
that
go
up
the
river
be
draw
against
the
stream
by
oxen
,
which
swim
through
one
of
the
arch
of
this
bridge
,
the
driver
sit
between
the
horn
of
the
foremost
beast
.
<EOS>
We
set
out
from
lyon
early
on
Monday
morning
,
and
as
a
robbery
have
be
a
few
day
before
commit
in
that
neighbourhood
,
I
order
my
servant
to
load
my
musquetoon
with
a
charge
of
eight
ball
.
<EOS>
by
the
bye
,
this
piece
do
not
fail
to
attract
the
curiosity
and
admiration
of
the
people
in
every
place
through
which
we
pass
.
<EOS>
the
carriage
no
sooner
halt
,
than
a
crowd
immediately
surround
the
man
to
view
the
blunderbuss
,
which
they
dignify
with
the
title
of
petit
canon
.
<EOS>
at
Nuys
in
Burgundy
,
he
fire
it
in
the
air
,
and
the
whole
mob
disperse
,
and
scamper
off
like
a
flock
of
sheep
.
<EOS>
in
our
journey
hither
,
we
generally
set
out
in
a
morning
at
eight
o'clock
,
and
travel
 
'
till
noon
,
when
the
mule
be
put
up
and
rest
a
couple
of
hour
.
<EOS>
during
this
halt
,
Joseph
go
to
dinner
,
and
we
go
to
breakfast
,
after
which
we
order
provision
for
our
refreshment
in
the
coach
,
which
we
take
about
three
or
four
in
the
afternoon
,
halt
for
that
purpose
,
by
the
side
of
some
transparent
brook
,
which
afford
excellent
water
to
mix
with
our
wine
.
<EOS>
in
this
country
I
be
almost
poison
with
garlic
,
which
they
mix
in
their
ragout
,
and
all
their
sauce
;
nay
,
the
smell
of
it
perfume
the
very
chamber
,
as
well
as
every
person
you
approach
.
<EOS>
I
be
also
very
sick
of
be
ficas
,
grive
,
or
thrush
,
and
other
little
bird
,
which
be
serve
up
twice
a
day
at
all
ordinary
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
They
make
their
appearance
in
vine
-
leave
,
and
be
always
half
raw
,
in
which
condition
the
French
choose
to
eat
them
,
rather
than
run
the
risque
of
lose
the
juice
by
over
-
roasting
.
  
<EOS>
the
peasant
on
the
South
of
France
be
poorly
clothe
,
and
look
as
if
they
be
half
-
starve
,
diminutive
,
swarthy
,
and
meagre
;
and
yet
the
common
people
who
travel
,
live
luxuriously
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
every
carrier
and
mule
-
driver
have
two
meal
a
day
,
consist
each
of
a
couple
of
course
and
a
dessert
,
with
tolerable
small
wine
.
<EOS>
that
which
be
call
hermitage
,
and
grow
in
this
province
of
Dauphine
,
be
sell
on
the
spot
for
three
livre
a
bottle
.
<EOS>
the
common
draught
,
which
you
have
at
meal
in
this
country
,
be
remarkably
strong
,
though
in
flavour
much
inferior
to
that
of
Burgundy
.
<EOS>
the
accommodation
be
tolerable
,
though
they
demand
(
even
in
this
cheap
country
)
<EOS>
the
exorbitant
price
of
four
livre
a
head
for
every
meal
,
of
those
who
choose
to
eat
in
their
own
apartment
.
<EOS>
I
insist
,
however
,
upon
pay
them
with
three
,
which
they
receive
,
though
not
without
murmur
and
seem
discontent
.
<EOS>
in
this
journey
,
we
find
plenty
of
good
mutton
,
pork
,
poultry
,
and
game
,
include
the
red
partridge
,
which
be
near
twice
as
big
as
the
partridge
of
England
.
<EOS>
Their
hare
be
likewise
surprisingly
large
and
juicy
.
<EOS>
We
see
great
flock
of
black
turkey
feed
in
the
field
,
but
no
black
cattle
;
and
milk
be
so
scarce
,
that
sometimes
we
be
oblige
to
drink
our
tea
without
it
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
perceive
a
meadow
on
the
side
of
the
road
,
full
of
a
flower
which
I
take
to
be
the
crocus
,
I
desire
my
servant
to
alight
and
pull
some
of
them
.
<EOS>
He
deliver
the
musquetoon
to
Joseph
,
who
begin
to
tamper
with
it
,
and
off
it
go
with
a
prodigious
report
,
augment
by
an
eccho
from
the
mountain
that
skirt
the
road
.
<EOS>
the
mule
be
so
frightened
,
that
they
go
off
at
the
gallop
;
and
Joseph
,
for
some
minute
,
could
neither
manage
the
rein
,
nor
open
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
at
length
he
recollect
himself
,
and
the
cattle
be
stopt
,
by
the
assistance
of
the
servant
,
to
whom
he
deliver
the
musquetoon
,
with
a
significant
shake
of
the
head
.
<EOS>
then
alight
from
the
box
,
he
examine
the
head
of
his
three
mule
,
and
kiss
each
of
them
in
his
turn
.
<EOS>
find
they
have
receive
no
damage
,
he
come
up
to
the
coach
,
with
a
pale
visage
and
stare
eye
,
and
say
it
be
God
's
mercy
he
have
not
kill
his
beast
.
<EOS>
I
answer
,
that
it
be
a
great
mercy
he
have
not
kill
his
passenger
;
for
the
muzzle
of
the
piece
may
have
be
direct
our
way
as
well
as
any
other
,
and
in
that
case
Joseph
may
have
be
hang
for
murder
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
as
good
be
hang
(
say
he
)
for
murder
,
as
be
ruin
by
the
loss
of
my
cattle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
adventure
make
such
an
impression
upon
him
,
that
he
recount
it
to
every
person
we
meet
;
nor
would
he
ever
touch
the
blunderbuss
from
that
day
.
<EOS>
I
be
often
divert
with
the
conversation
of
this
fellow
,
who
be
very
arch
and
very
communicative
.
<EOS>
every
afternoon
,
he
use
to
stand
upon
the
foot
-
board
,
at
the
side
of
the
coach
,
and
discourse
with
us
an
hour
together
.
<EOS>
pass
by
the
gibbet
of
Valencia
,
which
stand
very
near
the
high
-
road
,
we
see
one
body
hang
quite
naked
,
and
another
lying
break
on
the
wheel
.
<EOS>
I
recollect
,
that
Mandrin
have
suffer
in
this
place
,
and
call
to
Joseph
to
mount
the
foot
-
board
,
ask
if
he
have
ever
see
that
famous
adventurer
.
<EOS>
at
mention
of
the
name
of
Mandrin
,
the
tear
start
in
Joseph
's
eye
,
he
discharge
a
deep
sigh
,
or
rather
groan
,
and
tell
me
he
be
his
dear
friend
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
little
startled
at
this
declaration
;
however
,
I
conceal
my
thought
,
and
begin
to
ask
question
about
the
character
and
exploit
of
a
man
who
have
make
such
noise
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
Mandrin
be
a
native
of
Valencia
,
of
mean
extraction
:
that
he
have
serve
as
a
soldier
in
the
army
,
and
afterwards
act
as
maltotier
,
or
tax
-
gatherer
:
that
at
length
he
turn
contrebandier
,
or
smuggler
,
and
by
his
superior
quality
,
raise
himself
to
the
command
of
a
formidable
gang
,
consist
of
five
hundred
person
well
armed
with
carbine
and
pistol
.
<EOS>
He
have
fifty
horse
for
his
trooper
,
and
three
hundred
mule
for
the
carriage
of
his
merchandize
.
<EOS>
His
head
-
quarter
be
in
Savoy
:
but
he
make
incursion
into
Dauphine
,
and
set
the
marechaussee
at
defiance
.
<EOS>
He
maintain
several
bloody
skirmish
with
these
trooper
,
as
well
as
with
other
regular
detachment
,
and
in
all
those
action
signalize
himself
by
his
courage
and
conduct
.
<EOS>
come
up
at
one
time
with
fifty
of
the
marechaussee
who
be
in
quest
of
him
,
he
tell
them
very
calmly
,
he
have
occasion
for
their
horse
and
acoutrement
,
and
desire
them
to
dismount
.
<EOS>
at
that
instant
his
gang
appear
,
and
the
trooper
comply
with
his
request
,
without
make
the
least
opposition
.
<EOS>
Joseph
say
he
be
as
generous
as
he
be
brave
,
and
never
molest
traveller
,
nor
do
the
least
injury
to
the
poor
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
relieve
them
very
often
.
<EOS>
He
use
to
oblige
the
gentleman
in
the
country
to
take
his
merchandize
,
his
tobacco
,
brandy
,
and
muslin
,
at
his
own
price
;
and
,
in
the
same
manner
,
he
lay
the
open
town
under
contribution
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
no
merchandize
,
he
borrow
money
off
them
upon
the
credit
of
what
he
should
bring
when
he
be
better
provide
.
<EOS>
He
be
at
last
betray
,
by
his
wench
,
to
the
colonel
of
a
french
regiment
,
who
go
with
a
detachment
in
the
night
to
the
place
where
he
lie
in
Savoy
,
and
surprize
him
in
a
wood
-
house
,
while
his
people
be
absent
in
different
part
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
for
this
intrusion
,
the
court
of
France
make
an
apology
to
the
king
of
Sardinia
,
in
whose
territory
he
be
take
.
<EOS>
Mandrin
be
convey
to
Valencia
,
his
native
place
,
be
for
some
time
permit
to
go
abroad
,
under
a
strong
guard
,
with
chain
upon
his
leg
;
and
here
he
converse
freely
with
all
sort
of
people
,
flatter
himself
with
the
hope
of
a
pardon
,
in
which
,
however
,
he
be
disappointed
.
<EOS>
an
order
come
from
court
to
bring
him
to
his
trial
,
when
he
be
find
guilty
,
and
condemn
to
be
break
on
the
wheel
.
<EOS>
Joseph
say
he
drink
a
bottle
of
wine
with
him
the
night
before
his
execution
.
<EOS>
He
bear
his
fate
with
great
resolution
,
observe
that
if
the
letter
which
he
have
write
to
the
King
have
be
deliver
,
he
certainly
should
have
obtain
his
Majesty
's
pardon
.
<EOS>
His
executioner
be
one
of
his
own
gang
,
who
be
pardon
on
condition
of
perform
this
office
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
that
criminal
break
upon
the
wheel
be
first
strangle
,
unless
the
sentence
import
,
that
they
shall
be
break
alive
.
<EOS>
as
Mandrin
have
not
be
guilty
of
cruelty
in
the
course
of
his
delinquency
,
he
be
indulge
with
this
favour
.
<EOS>
speak
to
the
executioner
,
whom
he
have
formerly
command
,
"
Joseph
(
dit
il
)
,
<EOS>
je
ne
veux
pas
que
tu
<EOS>
me
touche
,
jusqu'a
ce
que
je
sois
roid
mort
,
"
"
Joseph
<EOS>
,
"
say
he
,
"
thou
shalt
not
touch
me
till
I
be
quite
dead
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Our
driver
have
no
sooner
pronounce
these
word
,
than
I
be
strike
with
a
suspicion
,
that
he
himself
be
the
executioner
of
his
friend
Mandrin
.
<EOS>
on
that
suspicion
,
I
exclaim
,
"
ah
!
ah
!
<EOS>
Joseph
!
"
<EOS>
the
fellow
blush
up
to
the
eye
,
and
say
,
Oui
,
son
nom
etoit
Joseph
aussi
bien
que
le
mien
,
"
yes
,
he
be
call
Joseph
,
as
I
be
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
proper
to
prosecute
the
inquiry
;
but
do
not
much
relish
the
nature
of
Joseph
's
connexion
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
he
have
very
much
the
look
of
a
ruffian
;
though
,
I
must
own
,
his
behaviour
be
very
obliging
and
submissive
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
fifth
day
of
our
journey
,
in
the
morning
,
we
pass
the
famous
bridge
at
St
Esprit
,
which
to
be
sure
be
a
great
curiosity
,
from
its
length
,
and
the
number
of
its
arch
:
but
these
arch
be
too
small
:
the
passage
above
be
too
narrow
;
and
the
whole
appear
to
be
too
slight
,
consider
the
force
and
impetuosity
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
comparable
to
the
bridge
at
Westminster
,
either
for
beauty
or
solidity
.
<EOS>
here
we
enter
Languedoc
,
and
be
stop
to
have
our
baggage
examine
;
but
the
searcher
,
be
tip
with
a
three
-
livre
piece
,
allow
it
to
pass
.
<EOS>
before
we
leave
Dauphine
,
I
must
observe
,
that
I
be
not
a
little
surprized
to
see
fig
and
chestnut
grow
in
the
open
field
,
at
the
discretion
of
every
passenger
.
<EOS>
It
be
this
day
<EOS>
I
see
the
famous
Pont
du
Garde
;
but
as
I
can
not
possibly
include
,
in
this
letter
,
a
description
of
that
beautiful
bridge
,
and
of
the
other
antiquity
belong
to
Nismes
,
I
will
defer
it
till
the
next
opportunity
,
be
,
in
the
mean
time
,
with
equal
truth
and
affection
,
 
Dear
Sir

Your

humble

<EOS>
MONTPELLIER
,
November
10
,
1763
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
by
the
Pont
<EOS>
St
Esprit
we
enter
the
province
of
Languedoc
,
and
breakfast
at
Bagniole
,
which
be
a
little
paltry
town
;
from
whence
,
however
,
there
be
an
excellent
road
through
a
mountain
,
make
at
a
great
expence
,
and
extend
about
four
league
.
<EOS>
about
five
in
the
afternoon
,
I
have
the
first
glimpse
of
the
famous
Pont
du
Garde
,
which
stand
on
the
right
hand
,
about
the
distance
of
a
league
from
the
post
-
road
to
Nismes
,
and
about
three
league
from
that
city
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
willingly
pass
for
a
false
enthusiast
in
taste
;
but
I
can
not
help
observe
,
that
from
the
first
distant
view
of
this
noble
monument
,
till
we
come
near
enough
to
see
it
perfectly
,
I
feel
the
strong
emotion
of
impatience
that
I
have
ever
know
;
and
oblige
our
driver
to
put
his
mule
to
the
full
gallop
,
in
the
apprehension
that
it
would
be
dark
before
we
reach
the
place
.
<EOS>
I
expect
to
find
the
building
,
in
some
measure
,
ruinous
;
but
be
agreeably
disappointed
,
to
see
it
look
as
fresh
as
the
bridge
at
Westminster
.
<EOS>
the
climate
be
either
so
pure
and
dry
,
or
the
free
-
stone
,
with
which
it
be
build
,
so
hard
,
that
the
very
angle
of
them
remain
as
acute
as
if
they
have
be
cut
last
year
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
some
large
stone
have
drop
out
of
the
arch
;
but
the
whole
be
admirably
preserve
,
and
present
the
eye
with
a
piece
of
architecture
,
so
unaffectedly
elegant
,
so
simple
,
and
majestic
,
that
I
will
defy
the
most
phlegmatic
and
stupid
spectator
to
behold
it
without
admiration
.
<EOS>
It
be
raise
in
the
Augustan
age
,
by
the
roman
colony
of
Nismes
,
to
convey
a
stream
of
water
between
two
mountain
,
for
the
use
of
that
city
.
<EOS>
It
stand
over
the
river
Gardon
,
which
be
a
beautiful
pastoral
stream
,
brawl
among
rock
,
which
form
a
number
of
pretty
natural
cascade
,
and
overshadow
on
each
side
with
tree
and
shrub
,
which
greatly
add
to
the
rural
beauty
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
It
rise
in
the
Cevennes
,
and
the
sand
of
it
produce
gold
,
as
we
learn
from
Mr
Reaumur
,
in
his
essay
on
this
subject
,
insert
in
the
French
Memoirs
,
for
the
year
1718
.
<EOS>
if
I
live
at
Nismes
,
or
Avignon
(
which
last
city
be
within
four
short
league
of
it
)
<EOS>
I
should
take
pleasure
in
form
party
to
come
hither
,
in
summer
,
to
dine
under
one
of
the
arch
of
the
Pont
du
Garde
,
on
a
cold
collation
.
  
<EOS>
this
work
consist
of
three
bridge
,
or
tire
of
arch
,
one
above
another
;
the
first
of
six
,
the
second
of
eleven
,
and
the
third
of
thirty
-
six
.
<EOS>
the
height
,
comprehend
the
aqueduct
on
the
top
,
amount
to
174
foot
three
inch
:
the
length
between
the
two
mountain
,
which
it
unite
,
extend
to
723
.
<EOS>
the
order
of
architecture
be
the
Tuscan
,
but
the
symmetry
of
it
be
inconceivable
.
<EOS>
by
scoop
the
basis
of
the
pilaster
,
of
the
second
tire
of
arch
,
they
have
make
a
passage
for
foot
-
traveller
:
but
though
the
antient
far
excel
us
in
beauty
,
they
certainly
fall
short
of
the
modern
in
point
of
conveniency
.
<EOS>
the
citizen
of
Avignon
have
,
in
this
particular
,
improve
the
roman
work
with
a
new
bridge
,
by
apposition
,
construct
on
the
same
plan
with
that
of
the
low
tire
of
arch
,
of
which
indeed
it
seem
to
be
a
part
,
afford
a
broad
and
commodious
passage
over
the
river
,
to
horse
and
carriage
of
all
kind
.
<EOS>
the
aqueduct
,
for
the
continuance
of
which
this
superb
work
be
raise
,
convey
a
stream
of
sweet
water
from
the
fountain
of
Eure
,
near
the
city
of
Uzes
,
and
extend
near
six
league
in
length
.
  
<EOS>
in
approach
Nismes
,
you
see
the
ruin
of
a
roman
tower
,
build
on
the
summit
of
a
hill
,
which
over
-
look
the
city
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
have
be
intend
,
at
first
,
as
a
watch
,
or
signal
-
tower
,
though
,
in
the
sequel
,
it
be
use
as
a
fortress
:
what
remain
of
it
,
be
about
ninety
foot
high
;
the
architecture
of
the
Doric
order
.
<EOS>
I
no
sooner
alighted
at
the
inn
,
than
I
be
present
with
a
pamphlet
,
contain
an
account
of
Nismes
and
its
antiquity
,
which
every
stranger
buy
.
<EOS>
there
be
person
too
who
attend
in
order
to
shew
the
town
,
and
you
will
always
be
accost
by
some
shabby
antiquarian
,
who
present
you
with
medal
for
sale
,
assure
you
they
be
genuine
antique
,
and
be
dig
out
of
the
ruin
of
the
roman
temple
and
bath
.
<EOS>
all
those
fellow
be
cheat
;
and
they
have
often
lay
under
contribution
raw
english
traveller
,
who
have
more
money
than
discretion
.
<EOS>
to
such
they
sell
the
vile
and
most
common
trash
:
but
when
they
meet
with
a
connoisseur
,
they
produce
some
medal
which
be
really
valuable
and
curious
.
  
<EOS>
Nismes
,
antiently
call
Nemausis
,
be
originally
a
colony
of
Romans
,
settle
by
Augustus
Caesar
,
after
the
battle
of
Actium
.
<EOS>
It
be
still
of
considerable
extent
,
and
say
to
contain
twelve
thousand
family
;
but
the
number
seem
,
by
this
account
,
to
be
greatly
exaggerate
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
the
city
must
have
be
formerly
very
extensive
,
as
appear
from
the

be
see

<EOS>
Its
present
size

not
one
third
of
its
former
extent

<EOS>
Its
temple
,
bath

statue
,
tower
,
basilica

and
amphitheatre
,
prove
it
to
have
be
a
city
of
great
opulence
and
magnificence
.
<EOS>
at
present
,
the
remain

these

be
all
that
make
it
respectable
or
remarkable
;
though
here
be
manufacture
of
silk
and
wool
,
carry
on
with
good
success
.
<EOS>
the
water
necessary
for
these
work
be
supply
by
a
source
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
,
upon
which
the
tower

and
here
be
discover
the

roman
bath

which

<EOS>
among

and
among
other
thing
,
the
finger
of
a
colossal
statue
in
bronze
,
which
,
accord
to
the
rule
of
proportion
,
must
have
be
fifteen
foot
high
.
<EOS>
from
these
particular
,
it
appear
that
the
edifice
must
have
be
spacious
and
magnificent
.
<EOS>
part
of
a
tesselate
pavement
still
remain

<EOS>
the
antient
pavement
of
the
bath
be
still
intire
;
all
the
rubbish
have
be
clear
away
;
and
the
bath
,
in
a
great
measure
,
restore
on
the
old
plan
,
though
they
be
not
at
present
use
for
any
thing
but
ornament
.
<EOS>
the
water
be
collect
into
two
vast
reservoir

and
a
canal
build
and
line
with
hewn
stone

<EOS>
there
be
three
handsome

this
vast

<EOS>
It
contain
a
great
body
of
excellent

,
which
by
pipe
and
other
small
branching
canal

traverse
the
town
,
and
be
convert
to
many
different
purpose
of
oeconomy
and
manufacture
.
<EOS>
between
the
roman

these
great
canal
,
the
ground
be
agreeably
lay
out
in
pleasure

<EOS>
for
the
recreation
of
the

<EOS>
here
be
likewise
ornament
of
architecture
,
which
savour
much
more
of
french
foppery
,
than
of
the
simplicity
and
greatness
of
the
antient
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
surprizing
,
that
this
fountain
should
produce
such
a
great
body
of
water
,
as
fill
the
basin
of
the
source
,
the
roman
basin
,
two
large

two

<EOS>
eighteen

<EOS>
when
I
see
it

there
be
in
it
about
eight

nine
foot

transparent

crystal

<EOS>
It
must
be
observe
,
however
,
for
the
honour
of
french
cleanliness
,
that
in
the
roman
basin

through
which
this
noble

I

two

<EOS>
surprize
,

much
disgusted
at
this

<EOS>

I
ask
by

by
whose

those
dirty

have
get
down
into
the

in
order

they

<EOS>
front
the
roman
bath
be
the
ruin
of
an
antient
temple
,
which
,
accord
to
tradition
,
be
dedicate
to
Diana
:
but
it
have
be
observe
by
connoisseur
,
that
all
the
antient
temple
of
this
goddess
be
of
the
ionic
order
;
whereas
,
this
be
partly
corinthian
,
and
partly
composite

<EOS>
It

about
seventy
foot

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
on

<EOS>
It

during
the
civil
war
that

reign
of
Henry

<EOS>
It
be
amazing
,
that
the
successive
irruption
of
barbarous
nation
,
of
Goths
,
Vandals
,
and
moor
;
of
fanatic
croisard
,
still
more
sanguinary
and
illiberal
than
those
Barbarians
,
should
have
spare
this
temple
,
as
well
as
two
other
still
more
noble
monument
of
architecture
,
that
to
this
day
adorn
the
city
of
Nismes
:
<EOS>
I
mean
the
amphitheatre
and
the
edifice
,
call
Maison
Carree
 
<EOS>
the
former
of
these
be
count
the
fine
monument
of
the
kind
,
now
extant
;
and
be
build
in
the
reign
of
Antoninus
Pius
,
who
contribute
a
large
sum
of
money
towards
its
erection
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
an
oval
figure
,
one
thousand
and
eighty
foot
in
circumference
,
capacious
enough
to
hold
twenty
thousand
spectator
.
<EOS>
the
architecture
be
of
the
tuscan
order
,
sixty
foot

,
compose
of
two
open

threescore

<EOS>
the
entrance
into
the

with
porticos

and
the
seat
,
of
which
there
be
thirty

rise
one

,
consist
of
great
block

many

still

<EOS>
over

,
appear
two
bull

in
alto
-
relievo
,
extremely
well
execute
,
emblem
which
,
accord
to
the
custom

the
Romans
,
signify
that
the
amphitheatre

erect
at
the
expence
of
the
people

<EOS>
there
be

other

some
work
in

bust
but
indifferently

.
<EOS>
It
stand
in
the
low
part
of
the
town
,
and
strike
the
spectator
with
awe
and
veneration
.
<EOS>
the
external
architecture
be
almost
intire
in
its
whole
circuit
;
but
the
arena
be
fill
up
with
house
 
<EOS>
this
amphitheatre
be
fortify
as
a
citadel
by
the
visigoth
,
in
the
beginning
of
the
sixth
century
.
<EOS>
They
raise
within
it
a
castle
,
two
tower
of
which
be
still
extant
;
and
they
surround
it
with
a
broad
and
deep
fossee
,
which
be
fill
up
in
the
thirteenth
century
.
<EOS>
in
all
the
subsequent
war
to
which
this
city
be
expose
,
it
serve
as
the
last
resort
of
the
citizen
,
and
sustain
a
great
number
of
successive
attack
;
so
that
its
preservation
be
almost
miraculous
.
<EOS>
It
be
likely
,
however
,
to
suffer
much
more
from
the
gothic
avarice
of
its
own
citizen
,
some
of
whom
be
mutilate
it
every
day
,
for
the
sake
of
the
stone
,
which
they
employ
in
their
own
private
building
.
<EOS>
It
be
surprize
,
that
the
King
's
authority
have
not
be
exert
to
put
an
end
to
such
sacrilegious
violation
.
  
<EOS>
if
the
amphitheatre
strike
you
with
an
idea
of
greatness
,
the
Maison
Carree
enchant
you
with
the
most
exquisite
beauty
of
architecture
and
sculpture
.
<EOS>
this
be
an
edifice
,
suppose
formerly
to
have
be
erect
by
Adrian
,
who
actually
build
a
basilica
in
this
city

though
no
vestige
of
it
remain

but
the
follow
inscription
,
which
be
discover
on

plainly
prove

it

the

he
have
even
speak
to
my
servant
,
and
ask
who
be
his
master
,
and
the
man

not

him

reply
,
he
be
a
gentleman
from
Chelsea
.
<EOS>
He
have
walk
by
the
door
of
the
house
where
I
lodge
at
Paris
,
twenty
time
,
while
I
be
in
that
city
;
and
the
very
day
before
he
arrive
at
Montpellier
,
he
have
pass
our
coach
on
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
the
garrison
of
this
city
consist
of
two
battalion
,
one
of
which
be
the
irish
regiment
of
Berwick
,
command
by
lieutenant
colonel
Tents
,
a
gentleman
with
whom
we
contract
an
acquaintance
at
Boulogne
.
<EOS>
He
treat
us
with
great
politeness
,
and
indeed
do
every
thing
in
his
power
to
make
the
place
agreeable
to
us

<EOS>
the
duke
of
Fitz

James

the

be
expect
here
in
a
little
time
.
<EOS>
We
have
already
a
tolerable
concert
twice
a
week
;
there
will
be
a
comedy
in
the
winter
;
and
the
state
of
Provence
assemble
in
January
,
so
that
Montpellier
will
be
extremely
gay
and
brilliant
.
<EOS>
these
very
circumstance
would
determine
me
to
leave
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
health
to
enjoy
these
pleasure
<EOS>
:
I
can
not
bear
a
croud
of
company
such
as
pour
in
upon
us
unexpectedly
at
all
hour
;
and
I
foresee
,
that
in
stay
at
Montpellier
,
I
should
be
lead
into
an
expence
,
which
I
can
ill
afford
.
<EOS>
I
have
therefore
forward
the
letter
I
receive
from
general
P

to
Mr
B
 
d

Nice

signify
my
intention
of
go
thither
,
and
explain
the
kind
of
accommodation
I
would
choose
to
have
at
that
place

<EOS>
the
day
after

I
procure
tolerable
lodging
in
the
High

,
for
which
I
pay
fifty

something
more
than
two
shilling
per

;
and
I
be
furnish
with
two

a

by
a
traiteur
for
ten

but
he
find
neither
the

and
indeed
we

Dear
Sir

Your
affectionate
humble
servant

<EOS>
MONTPELLIER
,
November
12
.
  
<EOS>
dear
DOCTOR
 
<EOS>
I
flatter
myself
with
the
hope
of
much
amusement
during
my
short
stay
at
Montpellier
.
 
<EOS>
the
University
,
the
Botanical
Garden
,
the
State
of
Physic
in
this
part
of
the
world
,
and
the
information
I
receive
of
a
curious
collection
of
manuscript
,
among
which
I
hope
to
find
something
for
our
friend
Dr
H
 
r
;
all
these
particular
promise
a
rich
fund
of
entertainment
,
which
,
however
,
I
can
not
enjoy
.
  
<EOS>
a
few
day
after
my
arrival
,
it
begin
to
rain
with
a
southerly
wind
,
and
continue
without
cease
the
good
part
of
a
week
,
leave
the
air
so
load
with
vapour
,
that
there
be
no
walking
after
sun
-
set
;
without
be
wet
by
the
dew
almost
to
the
skin
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
find
a
cold
and
damp
atmosphere
the
most
unfavourable
of
any
to
my
constitution
.
<EOS>
My
asthmatical
disorder
.
<EOS>
which
have
not
give
me
much
disturbance
since
I
leave
Boulogne
,
become
now
very
troublesome
,
attend
with
fever
,
cough
spitting
,
and
lowness
of
spirit
;
and
I
waste
visibly
every
day
.
<EOS>
I
be
favour
with
the
advice
of
Dr
Fitzmaurice
,
a
very
worthy
sensible
physician
settle
in
this
place
:
but
I
have
the
curiosity
to
know
the
opinion
of
the
celebrated
professor
F
 
,
who
be
the
Boerhaave
of
Montpellier
.
<EOS>
the
account
I
have
of
his
private
character
and
personal
deportment
,
from
some
english
people
to
whom
he
be
well
know
,
leave
me
no
desire
to
converse
with
him
:
but
I
resolve
to
consult
with
him
on
paper
.
<EOS>
this
great
lanthorn
of
medicine
be
become
very
rich
and
very
insolent
;
and
in
proportion
as
his
wealth
increase
,
he
be
say
to
grow
the
more
rapacious
.
<EOS>
He
pique
himself
upon
be
very
slovenly
,
very
blunt
,
and
very
unmannerly
;
and
perhaps
to
these
qualification
be
owe
his
reputation
rather
than
to
any
superior
skill
in
medicine
.
<EOS>
I
have
know
them
succeed
in
our
own
country
;
and
see
a
doctor
's
part
estimate
by
his
brutality
and
presumption
.
  
<EOS>
F
  
be
in
his
person
and
address
not
unlike
our
old
acquaintance
<EOS>
Dr
Sm
 
<EOS>
ie
;
he
stoop
much
,
dodge
along
,
and
affect
to
speak
the
Patois
,
which
be
a
corruption
of
the
old
provencial
tongue
,
speak
by
the
vulgar
in
Languedoc
and
Provence
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
his
great
age
and
great
wealth
,
he
will
still
scramble
up
two
pair
of
stair
for
a
fee
of
six
livre
;
and
without
a
fee
he
will
give
his
advice
to
no
person
whatsoever
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
say
to
have
great
practice
in
the
venereal
branch
and
to
be
frequent
by
person
of
both
sex
infect
with
this
distemper
,
not
only
from
every
part
of
France
,
but
also
from
Spain
,
Italy
,
Germany
,
and
England
.
<EOS>
I
need
say
nothing
of
the
Montpellier
method
of
cure
,
which
be
well
know
at
London
;
but
I
have
some
reason
to
think
the
great
professor
F
 
,
<EOS>
have
,
like
the
famous
Mrs
Mapp
,
the

cure

be

as
it

<EOS>
consider
the
nature
of

you
see
I
could
not
treat

more
civilly

desire
the

ask

whether
he
expect

desire

,
as
the

give
him

that
whatever

should
be
for
his
(
the

advantage

<EOS>

do
not

to
which
,
indeed

he
have
no

in

ungracious
dilemma

instead
of
justify
himself
by
reason
or
argument
,
have
recourse
to
recrimination

<EOS>
in
the
paper
which
he
send
me
next
day
,
he
insist
in
general
that
he
have
carefully
peruse
the
case
(
which
you
will
perceive
be
a
self
-
evident
untruth
)
;
he
say
the
theory
it
contain
be
idle
;
that
he
be
sure
it
could
not
be
write
by
a
physician

that
,
with
respect
to
the
disorder
,
he
be
still
of
the

opinion
;
and
adhere
to
his
former
prescription

if
I
have
any

I
may
come

he

instead
of
keep
his
promise
to
the
valet
,
he
put
the
money
in
his
pocket
;
and
the
fellow
return
in
a
rage
,
exclaim
that
he
be
un
gros
cheval
de
carosse
,
a
great
coach
-
horse
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
make
no
other
comment
upon
the
medicine
,
and
the
regiman
which
this
great
Doctor
prescribed
;
but
that
he
certainly
mistake
the
case
:
that
upon
the
supposition
I
actually
labour
under
a
purulent
discharge
from
the
lung
,
his
remedy
savour
strongly
of
the
old
woman
;
and
that
there
be
a
total
blank
with
respect
to
the
article
of
exercise
,
which
you
know
be
so
essential
in
all
pulmonary
disorder
.
<EOS>
but
after
have
peruse
my
remark
upon
his
first
prescription
,
he
could
not
possibly
suppose
that
I
have
tubercule
,
and
be
spit
up
pus
;
therefore
his
persisting
in
recommend
the
same
medicine
he
have
prescribe
on
that
supposition
,
be
a
flagrant
absurdity
.
 
<EOS>
if
,
for
example
,
there
be
no
vomica
in
the
lung
;
and
the
business
be
to
attenuate
the
lymph
,
what
could
be
more
preposterous
than
to
advise
the
chalk
of
Briancon
,
coral
,
antihecticum
poterii
,
and
the
balm
of
Canada
?
<EOS>
as
for
the
turtle
-
soupe
,
it
be
a
good
restorative
and
balsamic
;
but
,
I
apprehend
,
will
tend
to
thicken
rather
than
attenuate
the
phlegm
.
<EOS>
He
mention
not
a
syllable
of
the
air
,
though
it
be
universally
allow
,
that
the
climate
of
Montpellier
be
pernicious
to
ulcerated
lung
;
and
here
I
can
not
help
recount
a
small
adventure
which
our
doctor
have
with
a
son
of
Mr
O
 
d
,
merchant
in
the
city
of
London
.
<EOS>
I
have
it
from
Mrs
St
 
e
who
be
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
,
be
consumptive
,
consult
Mr
F
 
,
who
continue
visit
and
prescribe
for
him
a
whole
month
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
perceive
that
he
grow
daily
bad
,
"
Doctor
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
I
take
your
prescription
punctually
;
but
,
instead
of
be
the
well
for
them
,
I
have
now
not
an
hour
's
remission
from
the
fever
in
the
four
-
and
-
twenty
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
conceive
the
meaning
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
F
 
,
who
perceive
he
have
not
long
to
live
,
tell
him
the
reason
be
very
plain
:
the
air
of
Montpellier
be
too
sharp
for
his
lung
,
which
require
a
soft
climate
.
<EOS>
"
then
you
be
a
sordid
villain
(
cry
the
young
man
)
for
allow
me
to
stay
here
till
my
constitution
be
irretrievable
.
"
<EOS>
He
set
out
immediately
for
Tholouse
,
and
in
a
few
week
die
in
the
neighbourhood
of
that
city
.
  
<EOS>
I
observe
that
the
physician
in
this
country
pay
no
regard
to
the
state
of
the
solid
in
chronical
disorder
,
<EOS>
that
exercise
and
the
cold
bath
be
never
prescribe
,
that
they
seem
to
think
the
scurvy
be
entirely
an
english
disease
;
and
that
,
in
all
appearance
,
they
often
confound
the
symptom
of
it
,
with
those
of
the
venereal
distemper
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
may
be
more
particular
on
this
subject
in
a
subsequent
letter
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
I
be
ever

considerable

assemble
every

to
take
the
air
on
the
esplanade

where
there
be
a
very
good
walk

just
without
the
gate
of
the
citadel
:
but
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
,
there
be
another
still
more
agreeable
,
call
the
peirou
,
<EOS>
from
whence
there
be
a
prospect
of
the
Mediterranean
on
one
side
,
and
of
the
Cevennes
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
here
be
a
good
equestrian
statue
of
Louis
XIV

front
one
gate
of
the
city

which
be
build

form
of
a
triumphal
arch

in

of
the

monarch

<EOS>
immediately
under
the
pierou
be
the
physic
garden

and
near
it
an
arcade
just
finish
for
an
aqueduct
,
to
convey
a
stream
of
water
to
the
upper
part
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
should
have
think
this
a
neat
piece
of
work
,
if
I
have
not
see
the
Pont
du
Garde
:
but
,
after
have
view
the
roman
arch
,
I
could
not
look
upon
this
but
with
pity
and
contempt
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
wonder
how
the
architect
could
be
so
fantastically
modern
,
have
such
a
noble
model
,
as
it
be
,
before
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
many
protestant
at
this
place
,
as
well
as
at
Nismes
,
and
they
be
no
longer
molest
on
the
score
of
religion
.
<EOS>
They
have
their
conventicle
in
the
country
,
where
they
assemble
privately
for
worship
.
<EOS>
these
be
well
known
;
and
detachment
be
send
out
every
Sunday
to
intercept
them
;
but
the
officer
have
always
private
direction
to
take
another
route
.
<EOS>
whether
this
indulgence
come
from
the
wisdom
and
lenity
of
the
government
,
or
be
purchase
with
money
of
the
command
officer
,
I
can
not
determine
:
but
certain
it
be
,
the
law
of
France
punish
capitally
every
protestant
minister
convict
of
have
perform
the
function
of
his
ministry
in
this
kingdom
;
and
one
be
hang
about
two
year
ago
,
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Montauban
.
  
<EOS>
the
market
in
Montpellier
be
well
supply
with
fish
,
poultry
,
butcher
's
meat
,
and
game
,
at
reasonable
rate
.
<EOS>
the
wine
of
the
country
be
strong
and
harsh
,
and
never
drank
,
but
when
mix
with
water
.
<EOS>
Burgundy
be
dear
,
and
so
be
the
sweet
wine
of
Frontignan
,
though
make
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Cette
.
<EOS>
You
know
it
be
famous
all
over
Europe
,
and
so
be
the
liqueur
,
or
dram
of
various
sort
,
compound
and
distil
at
Montpellier
.
<EOS>
Cette
be
the
sea
-
port
,
about
four
league
from
that
city
:
but
the
canal
of
Languedoc
come
up
within
a
mile
of
it
;
and
be
indeed
a
great
curiosity
:
a
work
in
all
respect
worthy
of
a
Colbert
,
under
whose
auspex
it
be
finish
.
<EOS>
when
I
find
such
a
general
tribute
of
respect
and
veneration
pay
to
the
memory
of
that
great
man
,
I
be
astonished
to
see
so
few
monument
of
public
utility
leave
by
other
minister
.
<EOS>
one
would
imagine
,
that
even
the
desire
of
praise
would
prompt
a
much
great
number
to
exert
themselves
for
the
glory
and
advantage
of
their
country
;
yet
in
my
opinion
,
the
French
have
be
ungrateful
to
Colbert
,
in
the
same
proportion
as
they
have
over
-
rate
the
character
of
his
master
.
<EOS>
through
all
France
one
meet
with
statue
and
triumphal
arch
erect
to
Louis
XIV
,
in
consequence
of
his
victory
;
by
which
,
likewise
,
he
acquire
the
title
of
Louis
le
Grand
.
<EOS>
but
how
be
those
victory
obtain
?
<EOS>
not
by
any
personal
merit
of
Louis
.
<EOS>
It
be
Colbert
who
improve
his
finance
,
and
enable
him
to
pay
his
army
.
<EOS>
It
be
Louvois
that
provide
all
the
necessary
of
war
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
Conde
,
a
Turenne
,
a
Luxemburg
,
a
Vendome
,
who
fight
his
battle
;
and
<EOS>
his
first
conquest
,
for
which
he
be
deify
by
the
pen
of
adulation
,
be
obtain
almost
without
bloodshed
,
over
weak
,
dispirited
,
divide
,
and
defenceless
nation
.
<EOS>
It
be
Colbert
that
improve
the
marine
,
institute
manufacture
,
encourage
commerce
,
undertake
work
of
public
utility
,
and
patronize
the
art
and
science
.
<EOS>
but
Louis
(
you
will
say
)
have
the
merit
of
choose
and
support
those
minister
,
and
those
general
.
<EOS>
I
answer
,
no
.
<EOS>
He
find
Colbert
and
Louvois
already
choose
:
he
find
Conde
and
Turenne
in
the
very
zenith
of
military
reputation
.
<EOS>
Luxemburg
be
Conde
's
pupil
;
and
Vendome
,
a
prince
of
the
blood
,
who
at
first
obtain
the
command
of
army
in
consequence
of
his
high
birth
,
and
happen
to
turn
out
a
man
of
genius
.
<EOS>
the
same
Louis
have
the
sagacity
to
revoke
the
edict
of
Nantz
;
to
entrust
his
army
to
a
Tallard
,
a
Villeroy
,
and
a
Marsin
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
humanity
to
ravage
the
country
,
burn
the
town
,
and
massacre
the
people
of
the
Palatinate
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
patriotism
to
impoverish
and
depopulate
his
own
kingdom
,
in
order
to
prosecute
scheme
of
the
most
lawless
ambition
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
consolation
to
beg
a
peace
from
those
he
have
provoke
to
war
by
the
most
outrageous
insolence
;
and
he
have
the
glory
to
espouse
Mrs
Maintenon
in
her
old
age
,
the
widow
of
the
buffoon
Scarron
.
<EOS>
without
all
doubt
,
it
be
from
irony
he
acquire
the
title
le
Grand
.
  
<EOS>
have
receive
a
favourable
answer
from
Mr
B
 
,
the
english
consul
at
Nice
,
and
recommend
the
care
of
my
heavy
baggage
to
Mr
Ray
,
who
undertake
to
send
it
by
sea
from
Cette
to
Villefranche
,
I
hire
a
coach
and
mule
for
seven
loui'dore
,
and
set
out
from
Montpellier
on
the
13th
of
November
,
the
weather
be
agreeable
,
though
the
air
be
cold
and
frosty
.
<EOS>
in
other
respect
there
be
no
sign
of
winter
:
the
olives
be
now
ripe
,
and
appear
on
each
side
of
the
road
as
black
as
sloe
;
and
the
corn
be
already
half
a
foot
high
.
<EOS>
on
the
second
day
of
our
journey
,
we
pass
the
Rhone
on
a
bridge
of
boat
at
Buccaire
,
and
lie
on
the
other
side
at
Tarrascone
.
<EOS>
next
day
we
put
up
at
a
wretched
place
call
Orgon
,
where
,
however
,
we
be
regale
with
an
excellent
supper
;
and
among
other
delicacy
,
with
a
dish
of
green
pease
.
<EOS>
Provence
be
a
pleasant
country
,
well
cultivated
;
but
the
inn
be
not
so
good
here
as
in
Languedoc
,
and
few
of
them
be
provide
with
a
certain
convenience
which
an
english
traveller
can
very
ill
dispense
with
.
<EOS>
those
you
find
be
generally
on
the
top
of
house
,
exceedingly
nasty
;
and
so
much
expose
to
the
weather
,
that
a
valetudinarian
can
not
use
them
without
hazard
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
at
Nismes
in
Languedoc
,
where
we
find
the
Temple
of
Cloacina
in
a
most
shocking
condition
,
the
servant
-
maid
tell
me
her
mistress
have
cause
it
to
be
make
on
purpose
for
the
english
traveller
;
but
now
she
be
very
sorry
for
what
she
have
do
,
as
all
the
French
who
frequent
her
house
,
instead
of
use
the
seat
,
leave
their
offering
on
the
floor
,
which
she
be
oblige
to
have
clean
three
or
four
time
a
day
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
degree
of
beastliness
,
which
would
appear
detestable
even
in
the
capital
of
North
-
Britain
.
<EOS>
on
the
fourth
day
of
our
pilgrimage
,
we
lay
in
the
suburb
of
Aix
,
but
do
not
enter
the
city
,
which
I
have
a
great
curiosity
to
see
.
<EOS>
the
villainous
asthma
baulk
me
of
that
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
I
be
pinch
with
the
cold
,
and
impatient
to
reach
a
warm
climate
.
<EOS>
Our
next
stage
be
at
a
paltry
village
,
where
we
be
poorly
entertain
.
<EOS>
I
look
so
ill
in
the
morning
,
that
the
good
woman
of
the
house
,
who
be
big
with
child
,
take
me
by
the
hand
at
parting
,
and
even
shed
tear
,
pray
fervently
that
God
would
restore
me
to
my
health
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
only
instance
of
sympathy
,
compassion
,
or
goodness
of
heart
,
that
I
have
meet
with
among
the
publican
of
France
.
<EOS>
indeed
at
Valencia
,
our
landlady
,
understanding
I
be
travel
to
Montpellier
for
my
health
would
have
dissuade
me
from
go
thither
;
and
exhort
me
,
in
particular
,
to
beware
of
the
physician
,
who
be
all
a
pack
of
assassin
.
<EOS>
She
advise
me
to
eat
fricassee
of
chicken
,
and
white
meat
,
and
to
take
a
good
bouillon
every
morning
.
  
<EOS>
a
bouillon
be
an
universal
remedy
among
the
good
people
of
France
;
insomuch
,
that
they
have
no
idea
of
any
person
's
dying
,
after
have
swallow
un
bon
bouillon
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
english
gentleman
,
who
be
rob
and
murder
about
thirty
year
ago
between
Calais
and
Boulogne
,
be
bring
to
the
post
-
house
of
Boulogne
with
some
sign
of
life
,
this
remedy
be
immediately
administer
.
<EOS>
"
what
surprise
me
greatly
,
(
say
the
post
-
master
,
speak
of
this
melancholy
story
to
a
friend
of
mine
,
two
year
after
it
happen
)
<EOS>
I
make
an
excellent
bouillon
,
and
pour
it
down
his
throat
with
my
own
hand
,
and
yet
he
do
not
recover
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
now
,
in
all
probability
,
this
bouillon
it
be
that
stop
his
breath
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
a
very
young
man
,
I
remember
to
have
see
a
person
suffocate
by
such
impertinent
officiousness
.
<EOS>
a
young
man
of
uncommon
part
and
erudition
,
very
well
esteem
at
the
university
of
G
 
<EOS>
ow
be
find
early
one
morning
in
a
subterranean
vault
among
the
ruin
of
an
old
archiepiscopal
palace
,
with
his
throat
cut
from
ear
to
ear
.
<EOS>
be
convey
to
a
public
-
house
in
the
neighbourhood
,
he
make
sign
for
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
and
in
all
probability
would
have
explain
the
cause
of
this
terrible
catastrophe
,
when
an
old
woman
,
see
the
windpipe
,
which
be
cut
,
stick
out
of
the
wound
,
and
mistake
it
for
the
gullet
,
by
way
of
give
him
a
cordial
to
support
his
spirit
,
pour
into
it
,
through
a
small
funnel
,
a
glass
of
burn
brandy
,
which
strangle
him
in
the
tenth
part
of
a
minute
.
<EOS>
the
gash
be
so
hideous
,
and
form
by
so
many
repeat
stroke
of
a
razor
,
that
the
surgeon
believe
he
could
not
possibly
be
the
perpetrator
himself
;
nevertheless
this
be
certainly
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
at
Brignolles
,
where
we
dine
,
I
be
oblige
to
quarrel
with
the
landlady
,
and
threaten
to
leave
her
house
,
before
she
would
indulge
us
with
any
sort
of
flesh
-
meat
.
<EOS>
It
be
meagre
day
,
and
she
have
make
her
provision
accordingly
.
<EOS>
She
even
hint
some
dissatisfaction
at
have
heretic
in
her
house
:
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
be
not
disposed
to
eat
stink
fish
,
with
ragout
of
egg
and
onion
,
I
insist
upon
a
leg
of
mutton
,
and
a
brace
of
fine
partridge
,
which
I
find
in
the
larder
.
<EOS>
next
day
,
when
we
set
out
in
the
morning
from
Luc
,
it
blow
a
north
-
westerly
wind
so
extremely
cold
and
biting
,
that
even
a
flannel
wrapper
could
not
keep
me
tolerably
warm
in
the
coach
.
<EOS>
whether
the
cold
have
put
our
coachman
in
a
bad
humour
,
or
he
have
some
other
cause
of
resentment
against
himself
,
I
know
not
;
but
we
have
not
go
above
a
quarter
of
a
mile
,
when
he
drive
the
carriage
full
against
the
corner
of
a
garden
wall
,
and
break
the
axle
-
tree
,
so
that
we
be
oblige
to
return
to
the
inn
on
foot
,
and
wait
a
whole
day
,
until
a
new
piece
could
be
make
and
adjust
.
<EOS>
the
wind
that
blow
,
be
call
Maestral
,
in
the
Provencial
dialect
,
and
indeed
be
the
severest
that
ever
I
feel
.
<EOS>
at
this
inn
,
we
meet
with
a
young
french
officer
who
have
be
a
prisoner
in
England
,
and
speak
our
language
pretty
well
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
that
such
a
wind
do
not
blow
above
twice
or
three
time
in
a
winter
,
and
be
never
of
long
continuance
,
that
in
general
,
the
weather
be
very
mild
and
agreeable
during
the
winter
month
;
that
living
be
very
cheap
in
this
part
of
Provence
,
which
afford
great
plenty
of
game
.
<EOS>
here
,
too
,
I
find
a
young
irish
recollet
,
in
his
way
from
Rome
to
his
own
country
.
<EOS>
He
complain
,
that
he
be
almost
starve
by
the
inhospitable
disposition
of
the
french
people
;
and
that
the
regular
clergy
,
in
particular
,
have
treat
him
with
the
most
cruel
disdain
.
<EOS>
I
relieve
his
necessity
,
and
give
him
a
letter
to
a
gentleman
of
his
own
country
at
Montpellier
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
rise
in
the
morning
,
and
open
a
window
that
look
into
the
garden
,
I
think
myself
either
in
a
dream
,
or
bewitch
.
<EOS>
all
the
tree
be
cloathe
with
snow
,
and
all
the
country
cover
at
least
a
foot
thick
.
<EOS>
"
this
can
not
be
the
south
of
France
,
(
say
I
to
myself
)
<EOS>
it
must
be
the
Highlands
of
Scotland
!
<EOS>
"
at
a
wretched
town
call
Muy
,
where
we
dine
,
I
have
a
warm
dispute
with
our
landlord
,
which
,
however
,
do
not
terminate
to
my
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
I
send
on
the
mule
before
,
to
the
next
stage
,
resolve
to
take
post
-
horse
,
and
bespoke
them
accordingly
of
the
aubergiste
,
who
be
,
at
the
same
time
,
inn
-
keeper
and
post
-
master
.
<EOS>
We
be
usher
into
the
common
eating
-
room
,
and
have
a
very
indifferent
dinner
;
after
which
,
I
send
a
loui'dore
to
be
change
,
in
order
to
pay
the
reckoning
.
<EOS>
the
landlord
,
instead
of
give
the
full
change
,
deduct
three
livre
a
head
for
dinner
,
and
send
in
the
rest
of
the
money
by
my
servant
.
<EOS>
provoke
more
at
his
ill
manner
,
than
at
his
extortion
,
I
ferret
him
out
of
a
bed
-
chamber
,
where
he
have
conceal
himself
,
and
oblige
him
to
restore
the
full
change
,
from
which
I
pay
him
at
the
rate
of
two
livre
a
head
.
<EOS>
He
refuse
to
take
the
money
,
which
I
throw
down
on
the
table
;
and
the
horse
be
ready
,
step
into
the
coach
,
order
the
postillion
to
drive
on
.
<EOS>
here
I
have
certainly
reckon
without
my
host
.
<EOS>
the
fellow
declare
they
would
not
budge
,
until
I
should
pay
their
master
;
and
as
I
threaten
them
with
manual
chastisement
,
they
alight
,
and
disappear
in
a
twinkling
.
<EOS>
I
be
now
so
incensed
,
that
though
I
could
hardly
breathe
;
though
the
afternoon
be
far
advanced
,
and
<EOS>
the
street
cover
with
wet
snow
,
I
walk
to
the
consul
of
the
town
,
and
make
my
complaint
in
form
.
<EOS>
this
magistrate
,
who
seem
to
be
a
taylor
,
accompany
me
to
the
inn
,
where
by
this
time
the
whole
town
be
assemble
,
and
endeavour
to
persuade
me
to
compromise
the
affair
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
as
he
be
the
magistrate
,
I
would
stand
to
his
award
.
<EOS>
He
answer
,
"
that
he
would
not
presume
to
determine
what
I
be
to
pay
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
pay
him
a
reasonable
price
for
his
dinner
,
(
say
I
)
<EOS>
and
now
I
demand
post
-
horse
accord
to
the
king
's
ordonnance
.
<EOS>
the
aubergiste
say
the
horse
be
ready
,
but
the
guide
be
run
away
;
and
he
could
not
find
other
to
go
in
their
place
.
<EOS>
I
argue
with
great
vehemence
,
offer
to
leave
a
loui'dore
for
the
poor
of
the
parish
,
provide
the
consul
would
oblige
the
rascal
to
do
his
duty
.
<EOS>
the
consul
shrug
up
his
shoulder
,
and
declare
it
be
not
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
lie
,
but
I
perceive
he
have
no
mind
to
disoblige
the
publican
.
<EOS>
if
the
mule
have
not
be
send
away
,
I
should
certainly
have
not
only
pay
what
I
think
proper
,
but
correct
the
landlord
into
the
bargain
,
for
his
insolence
and
extortion
;
but
now
I
be
entirely
at
his
mercy
,
and
as
the
consul
continue
to
exhort
me
in
very
humble
term
,
to
comply
with
his
demand
,
I
think
proper
to
acquiesce
.
<EOS>
then
the
postillion
immediately
appear
:
the
crowd
seem
to
exult
in
the
triumph
of
the
aubergiste
;
and
I
be
oblige
to
travel
in
the
night
,
in
very
severe
weather
,
after
all
the
fatigue
and
mortification
I
have
undergo
.
  
<EOS>
We
lie
at
Frejus
,
which
be
the
Forum
Julianum
of
the
antient
,
and
still
boast
of
some
remain
of
antiquity
;
particularly
the
ruin
of
an
amphitheatre
,
and
an
aqueduct
.
<EOS>
the
first
we
pass
in
the
dark
,
and
next
morning
the
weather
be
so
cold
that
I
could
not
walk
abroad
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
the
town
be
at
present
very
inconsiderable
,
and
indeed
in
a
ruinous
condition
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
we
be
very
well
lodge
at
the
post
-
house
,
and
treat
with
more
politeness
than
we
have
meet
with
in
any
other
part
of
France
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
have
a
very
high
mountain
to
ascend
in
the
morning
,
I
order
the
mule
on
before
to
the
next
post
,
and
hire
six
horse
for
the
coach
.
<EOS>
at
the
east
end
of
Frejus
,
we
see
close
to
the
road
on
our
left
-
hand
,
the
arcade
of
the
antient
aqueduct
,
and
the
ruin
of
some
roman
edifice
,
which
seem
to
have
be
temple
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
strike
in
the
architecture
of
the
aqueduct
.
<EOS>
the
arch
be
small
and
low
,
without
either
grace
or
ornament
,
and
seem
to
have
be
calculate
for
mere
utility
.
  
<EOS>
the
mountain
of
Esterelles
,
which
be
eight
mile
over
,
be
formerly
frequent
by
a
gang
of
desperate
bandit
,
who
be
now
happily
exterminate
:
the
road
be
very
good
,
but
in
some
place
very
steep
and
border
by
precipice
.
<EOS>
the
mountain
be
cover
with
pine
,
and
the
laurus
cerasus
,
the
fruit
of
which
be
now
ripe
,
make
a
most
romantic
appearance
through
the
snow
that
lie
upon
the
branch
.
<EOS>
the
cherry
be
so
large
that
I
at
first
mistake
them
for
dwarf
orange
.
<EOS>
I
think
they
be
count
poisonous
in
England
,
but
here
the
people
eat
them
without
hesitation
.
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
the
mountain
be
the
post
-
house
,
where
we
dine
in
a
room
so
cold
,
that
the
bare
remembrance
of
it
make
my
tooth
chatter
.
<EOS>
after
dinner
I
chance
to
look
into
another
chamber
that
front
the
south
,
where
the
sun
shine
;
and
open
a
window
perceive
,
within
a
yard
of
my
hand
,
a
large
tree
load
with
orange
,
many
of
which
be
ripe
.
<EOS>
You
may
judge
what
my
astonishment
be
to
find
Winter
in
all
his
rigour
reign
on
one
side
of
the
house
,
and
Summer
in
all
her
glory
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
the
middle
of
this
mountain
seem
to
be
the
boundary
of
the
cold
weather
.
<EOS>
as
we
proceed
slowly
in
the
afternoon
we
be
quite
enchant
.
<EOS>
this
side
of
the
hill
be
a
natural
plantation
of
the
most
agreeable
ever
-
green
,
pine
,
fir
,
laurel
,
cypress
,
sweet
myrtle
,
tamarisc
,
box
,
and
juniper
,
intersperse
with
sweet
marjoram
,
lavender
,
thyme
,
wild
thyme
,
and
sage
.
<EOS>
on
the
right
-
hand
the
ground
shoot
up
into
agreeable
cone
,
between
which
you
have
delightful
vista
of
the
Mediterranean
,
which
wash
the
foot
of
the
rock
;
and
between
two
division
of
the
mountain
,
there
be
a
bottom
water
by
a
charming
stream
,
which
greatly
add
to
the
rural
beauty
of
the
scene
.
  
<EOS>
this
night
we
pass
at
Cannes
,
a
little
fishing
town
,
agreeably
situate
on
the
beach
of
the
sea
,
and
in
the
same
place
lodge
Monsieur
Nadeau
d'Etrueil
,
the
unfortunate
french
governor
of
Guadeloupe
,
<EOS>
condemn
to
be
imprison
for
life
in
one
of
the
isle
Marguerite
,
which
lie
within
a
mile
of
this
coast
.
  
<EOS>
next
day
we
journey
by
the
way
of
Antibes
,
a
small
maritime
town
,
tolerably
well
fortified
;
and
pass
the
little
river
Loup
,
over
a
stone
-
bridge
,
arrive
about
noon
at
the
village
of
St
Laurent
,
the
extremity
of
France
,
where
we
pass
the
Var
,
after
our
baggage
have
undergo
examination
.
<EOS>
from
canne
to
this
village
the
road
lie
along
the
sea
-
side
;
and
sure
nothing
can
be
more
delightful
.
<EOS>
though
in
the
morning
there
be
a
frost
upon
the
ground
,
the
sun
be
as
warm
as
it
be
in
May
in
England
.
<EOS>
the
sea
be
quite
smooth
,
and
the
beach
form
of
white
polished
pebble
;
on
the
left
-
hand
the
country
be
cover
with
green
olive
,
and
the
side
of
the
road
plant
with
large
tree
of
sweet
myrtle
grow
wild
like
the
hawthorn
in
England
.
<EOS>
from
Antibes
we
have
the
first
view
of
Nice
,
lie
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
bay
,
and
make
a
very
agreeable
appearance
.
<EOS>
the
author
of
the
Grand
Tour
say
,
that
from
Antibes
to
Nice
the
road
be
very
bad
,
through
rugged
mountain
border
with
precipice
on
the
left
,
and
by
the
sea
to
the
right
;
whereas
,
in
fact
,
there
be
neither
precipice
nor
mountain
near
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
Var
,
which
divide
the
county
of
Nice
from
Provence
,
be
no
other
than
a
torrent
feed
chiefly
by
the
snow
that
melt
on
the
maritime
Alps
,
from
which
it
take
its
origin
.
<EOS>
in
the
summer
it
be
swell
to
a
dangerous
height
,
and
this
be
also
the
case
after
heavy
rain
:
but
at
present
the
middle
of
it
be
quite
dry
,
and
the
water
divide
into
two
or
three
narrow
stream
,
which
,
however
,
be
both
deep
and
rapid
.
<EOS>
this
river
have
be
absurdly
enough
by
some
suppose
the
Rubicon
,
in
all
probability
from
the
description
of
that
river
in
the
Pharsalia
of
Lucan
,
who
make
it
the
boundary
betwixt
Gaul
and
Italy

a

Frontier
that
part
the

from
the
rich

of

<EOS>
whereas
,
in

now
call

run
between
Ravenna
and
Rimini
.
 
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
the
Var
.
<EOS>
at
the
village
of
St
Laurent
,
famous
for
its
Muscadine
wine
,
there
be
a
set
of
guide
always
in
attendance
to
conduct
you
in
your
passage
over
the
river
.
<EOS>
six
of
those
fellow
,
tuck
up
above
the
middle
,
with
long
pole
in
their
hand
,
take
charge
of
our
coach
,
and
by
many
winding
guide
it
safe
to
the
opposite
shore
.
<EOS>
indeed
there
be
no
occasion
for
any
;
but
it
be
a
sort
of
a
perquisite
,
and
I
do
not
choose
to
run
any
risque
,
how
small
soever
it
may
be
,
for
the
sake
of
save
half
a
crown
,
with
which
they
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
if
you
do
not
gratify
the
searcher
at
St
Laurent
with
the
same
sum
,
they
will
rummage
your
trunk
,
and
turn
all
your
cloath
topsy
turvy
.
<EOS>
and
here
,
once
for
all
,
I
would
advise
every
traveller
who
consult
his
own
case
and
convenience
,
to
be
liberal
of
his
money
to
all
that
sort
of
people
;
and
even
to
wink
at
the
imposition
of
aubergiste
on
the
road
,
unless
it
be
very
flagrant
.
<EOS>
so
sure
as
you
enter
into
dispute
with
them
,
you
will
be
put
to
a
great
deal
of
trouble
,
and
fret
yourself
to
no
manner
of
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
have
travel
with
oeconomist
in
England
,
who
declare
they
would
rather
give
away
a
crown
than
allow
themselves
to
be
cheat
of
a
farthing
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
good
maxim
,
but
require
a
great
share
of
resolution
and
self
-
denial
to
put
it
in
practice
.
<EOS>
in
one
excursion
of
about
two
hundred
mile
my
fellow
-
traveller
be
in
a
passion
,
and
of
consequence
very
bad
company
from
one
end
of
the
journey
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
He
be
incessantly
scold
either
at
landlord
,
landlady
,
waiter
,
hostler
,
or
postilion
.
<EOS>
We
have
bad
horse
,
and
bad
chaise
;
set
out
from
every
stage
with
the
curse
of
the
people
;
and
at
this
expence
I
save
about
ten
shilling
in
the
whole
journey
.
<EOS>
for
such
a
paltry
consideration
,
he
be
content
to
be
miserable
himself
,
and
to
make
every
other
person
unhappy
with
whom
he
have
any
concern
.
<EOS>
when
I
come
last
from
Bath
it
rain
so
hard
,
that
the
postilion
who
drive
the
chaise
be
wet
to
the
skin
before
we
have
go
a
couple
of
mile
.
<EOS>
when
we
arrive
at
the
devise
,
I
give
him
two
shilling
instead
of
one
,
out
of
pure
compassion
.
<EOS>
the
consequence
of
this
liberality
be
,
that
in
the
next
stage
we
seem
rather
to
fly
than
to
travel
upon
solid
ground
.
<EOS>
I
continue
my
bounty
to
the
second
driver
,
and
indeed
through
the
whole
journey
,
and
find
myself
accommodate
in
a
very
different
manner
from
what
I
have
experience
before
.
<EOS>
I
have
elegant
chaise
,
with
excellent
horse
;
and
the
postilion
of
their
own
accord
use
such
diligence
,
that
although
the
road
be
break
by
the
rain
,
I
travel
at
the
rate
of
twelve
mile
an
hour
;
and
my
extraordinary
expence
from
Bath
to
London
,
amount
precisely
to
six
shilling
.
  
<EOS>
the
river
var
fall
into
the
Mediterranean
a
little
below
St
Laurent
,
about
four
mile
to
the
westward
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
within
the
memory
of
person
now
live
,
there
have
be
three
wooden
bridge
throw
over
it
,
and
as
often
destroy
in
consequence
of
the
jealousy
subsist
between
the
king
of
France
and
Sardinia
;
this
river
be
the
boundary
of
their
dominion
on
the
side
of
Provence
.
<EOS>
however
,
this
be
a
consideration
that
ought
not
to
interfere
with
the
other
advantage
that
would
accrue
to
both
kingdom
from
such
a
convenience
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
a
bridge
over
the
var
,
and
a
post
-
road
make
from
Nice
to
Genoa
,
I
be
very
confident
that
all
those
stranger
who
now
pass
the
Alps
in
their
way
to
and
from
Italy
,
would
choose
this
road
as
infinitely
more
safe
,
commodious
,
and
agreeable
.
<EOS>
this
would
also
be
the
case
with
all
those
who
hire
felucas
from
Marseilles
or
Antibes
,
and
expose
themselves
to
the
danger
and
inconvenience
of
travel
by
sea
in
an
open
boat
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
we
arrive
at
Nice
,
where
we
find
Mr
M
 
e
,
the
english
gentleman
whom
I
have
see
at
Boulogne
,
and
advise
to
come
hither
.
<EOS>
He
have
follow
my
advice
,
and
reach
Nice
about
a
month
before
my
arrival
,
with
his
lady
,
child
,
and
an
old
gouvernante
.
<EOS>
He
have
travel
with
his
own
post
-
chaise
and
horse
,
and
be
now
lodge
just
without
one
of
the
gate
of
the
city
,
in
the
house
of
the
count
de
v
 
n
,
for
which
he
pay
five
loui'dore
a
month
.
<EOS>
I
could
hire
one
much
better
in
the
neighbourhood
of
London
,
for
the
same
money
.
<EOS>
unless
you
will
submit
to
this
extortion
,
and
hire
a
whole
house
for
a
length
of
time
,
you
will
find
no
ready
-
furnished
lodging
at
Nice
.
<EOS>
after
have
stew
a
week
in
a
paltry
inn
,
I
have
take
a
ground
floor
for
ten
month
at
the
rate
of
four
hundred
livre
a
year
,
that
is
twenty
pound
sterling
,
for
the
piedmontese
livre
be
about
an
english
shilling
.
<EOS>
the
apartment
be
large
,
lofty
,
and
commodious
enough
,
with
two
small
garden
,
in
which
there
be
plenty
of
sallad
,
and
a
great
number
of
orange

but
as
it

some
time
to
provide
furniture
,
our
consul
Mr
B

one
of
the
good
natured
and
most
friendly

have
lend
me
his

which
be
charmingly
situate
by

and
open
upon
a
terrace

that
run
parallel

<EOS>
immediately
after

we
be
visit

the
lute
and
mandolin

and
have
a
pretty
collection
of
book

<EOS>
in
a
word
,
I
hope
we
shall
pass
the
winter
agreeably
enough
,
especially
if
Mr
M
 
e
should
hold
out
;
but
I
be
afraid
he
be
too
far
go
in
a
consumption
to
recover
.
<EOS>
He
spend
the
last
winter
at
Nismes
,
and
consult
F
  
at
Montpellier
.
<EOS>
I
be
impatient
to
see
the
prescription
,
and
find
it
almost
verbatim
the
same
he
have
send
to
me
;
although
I
be
persuade
there
be
a
very
essential
difference
between
our
disorder
.
<EOS>
Mr
M
 
e
have
be
long
afflict
with
violent
spasm
,
colliquative
sweat
,
prostration
of
appetite
,
and
a
disorder
in
his
bowel
.
<EOS>
He
be
likewise
jaundice
all
over
,
and
I
be
confident
his
liver
be
unsound
.
<EOS>
He
try
the
tortoise
soup
,
which
he
say
in
a
fortnight
stuff
him
up
with
phlegm
.
<EOS>
this
gentleman
have
get
a
smattering
of
physic
,
and
I
be
afraid
tamper
with
his
own
constitution
,
by
mean
of
Brookes
's
Practice
of
Physic
,
and
some
dispensatorie
,
which
he
be
continually
pore
over
.
<EOS>
I
beg
pardon
for
this
tedious
epistle

and
be
 
very
sincerely

NICE
,
January
15
,
1764
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
I
be
at
last
settle
at
Nice
,
and
have
leisure
to
give
you
some
account
of
this
very
remarkable
place
.
<EOS>
the
county
of
Nice
extend
about
fourscore
mile
in
length
,
and
in
some
place
it
be
thirty
mile
broad
.
<EOS>
It
contain
several
small
town
,
and
a
great
number
of
village
;
all
of
which
,
this
capital
except
,
be
situate
among
mountain
,
the
most
extensive
plain
of
the
whole
country
be
this
where
I
now
be
,
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
the
length
of
it
do
not
exceed
two
mile
,
nor
be
the
breadth
of
it
,
in
any
part
,
above
one
.
<EOS>
It
be
bound
by
the
Mediterranean
on
the
south
.
<EOS>
from
the
sea
-
shore
,
the
maritime
Alps
begin
with
hill
of
a
gentle
ascent
,
rise
into
mountain
that
form
a
sweep
or
amphitheatre
end
at
Montalban
,
which
overhang
the
town
of
Villa
Franca
.
<EOS>
on
the
west
side
of
this
mountain
,
and
in
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
amphitheatre
,
stand
the
city
of
Nice
,
wedge
in
between
a
steep
rock
and
the
little
river
Paglion
,
which
descend
from
the
mountain
,
and
wash
the
town
-
wall
on
the
west
side
,
fall
into
the
sea
,
after
have
fill
some
canal
for
the
use
of
the
inhabitant
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
stone
-
bridge
of
three
arch
over
it
,
by
which
those
who
come
from
Provence
enter
the
city
.
<EOS>
the
channel
of
it
be
very
broad
,
but
generally
dry
in
many
place
;
the
water
(
as
in
the
Var
)
divide
itself
into
several
small
stream
.
<EOS>
the
Paglion
be
feed
by
melted
snow
and
rain
in
the
mountain
,
be
quite
dry
in
summer
;
but
it
be
sometimes
swell
by
sudden
rain
to
a
very
formidable
torrent
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
case
in
the
year
1744
,
when
the
french
and
spanish
army
attack
eighteen
piedmontese
battalion
,
which
be
post
on
the
side
of
Montalban
.
<EOS>
the
assailant
be
repulse
with
the
loss
of
four
thousand
man
,
some
hundred
of
whom
perish
in
repasse
the
Paglion
,
which
have
swell
to
a
surprising
degree
during
the
battle
,
in
consequence
of
a
heavy
continued
rain
.
<EOS>
this
rain
be
of
great
service
to
the
Piedmontese
,
as
it
prevent
one
half
of
the
enemy
from
pass
the
river
to
sustain
the
other
.
<EOS>
five
hundred
be
take
prisoner
:
but
the
Piedmontese
,
foresee
they
should
be
surround
next
day
by
the
French
,
who
have
penetrate
behind
them
,
by
a
pass
in
the
mountain
,
retire
in
the
night
.
<EOS>
be
receive
on
board
the
English
Fleet
,
which
lie
at
Villa
Franca
,
they
be
convey
to
Oneglia
.
<EOS>
in
examine
the
body
of
those
that
be
kill
in
the
battle
,
the
inhabitant
of
Nice
perceive
,
that
a
great
number
of
the
spanish
soldier
be
circumcise
;
a
circumstance
,
from
which
they
conclude
,
that
a
great
many
Jews
engage
in
the
service
of
his
catholic
majesty
.
<EOS>
I
be
of
a
different
opinion
.
<EOS>
the
Jews
be
the
least
of
any
people
that
I
know
,
addict
to
a
military
life
.
<EOS>
I
rather
imagine
they
be
of
the
moorish
race
,
who
have
subsist
in
Spain
,
since
the
expulsion
of
their
brother
;
and
though
they
conform
externally
to
the
rite
of
the
catholic
religion
,
still
retain
in
private
their
attachment
to
the
law
of
Mahomet
.
  
<EOS>
the
city
of
Nice
be
build
in
form
of
an
irregular
isoscele
triangle
,
the
base
of
which
front
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
west
side
it
be
surround
by
a
wall
and
rampart
;
on
the
east
,
it
be
over
-
hang
by
a
rock
,
on
which
we
see
the
ruin
of
an
old
castle
,
which
,
before
the
invention
of
artillery
,
be
count
impregnable
.
<EOS>
It
be
take
and
dismantle
by
marechal
Catinat
,
in
the
time
of
Victor
Amadaeus
,
the
father
of
his
sardinian
majesty
.
<EOS>
It
be
afterwards
finally
demolish
by
the
duke
of
Berwick
towards
the
latter
end
of
queen
Anne
's
war
.
<EOS>
to
repair
it
would
be
a
very
unnecessary
expence
,
as
it
be
command
by
Montalban
,
and
several
other
eminence
.
  
<EOS>
the
town
of
Nice
be
altogether
indefensible
,
and
therefore
without
fortification
.
<EOS>
there
be
only
two
iron
gun
upon
a
bastion
that
front
the
beach
;
and
here
the
French
have
form
a
considerable
battery
against
the
english
cruiser
,
in
the
war
of
1744
,
when
the
Mareschal
Duke
de
Belleisle
have
his
headquarters
at
Nice
.
<EOS>
this
little
town
,
situate
in
the
bay
of
Antibes
,
be
almost
equidistant
from
Marseilles
,
Turin
,
and
Genoa
,
the
first
and
last
be
about
thirty
league
from
hence
by
sea
;
and
the
capital
of
Piedmont
at
the
same
distance
to
the
northward
,
over
the
mountain
.
<EOS>
It
lie
exactly
opposite
to
Capo
di
Ferro
,
on
the
coast
of
Barbary
;
and
,
the
island
of
Sardinia
and
Corsica
be
lay
down
about
two
degree
to
the
eastward
,
almost
exactly
in
a
line
with
Genoa
.
<EOS>
this
little
town
,
hardly
a
mile
in
circumference
,
be
say
to
contain
twelve
thousand
inhabitant
.
<EOS>
the
street
be
narrow
;
the
house
be
build
of
stone
,
and
the
window
in
general
be
fit
with
paper
instead
of
glass
.
<EOS>
this
expedient
would
not
answer
in
a
country
subject
to
rain
and
storm
;
but
here
,
where
there
be
very
little
of
either
,
the
paper
lozenge
answer
tolerably
well
.
<EOS>
the
bourgeois
,
however
,
begin
to
have
their
house
sashe
with
glass
.
<EOS>
between
the
town
-
wall
and
the
sea
,
the
fisherman
haul
up
their
boat
upon
the
open
beach
;
but
on
the
other
side
of
the
rock
,
where
the
castle
stand
,
be
the
port
or
harbour
of
Nice
,
upon
which
some
money
have
be
expend
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
small
basin
,
defend
to
seaward
by
a
mole
of
free
-
stone
,
which
be
much
better
contrive
than
execute
:
for
the
sea
have
already
make
three
breach
in
it
;
and
in
all
probability
,
in
another
winter
,
the
extremity
of
it
will
be
carry
quite
away
.
<EOS>
It
would
require
the
talent
of
a
very
skilful
architect
to
lay
the
foundation
of
a
good
mole
,
on
an
open
beach
like
this
;
expose
to
the
swell
of
the
whole
Mediterranean
,
without
any
island
or
rock
in
the
offing
,
to
break
the
force
of
the
wave
.
<EOS>
besides
,
the
shore
be
bold
,
and
the
bottom
foul
.
<EOS>
there
be
seventeen
foot
of
water
in
the
basin
,
sufficient
to
float
vessel
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
ton
;
and
this
be
chiefly
supply
by
a
small
stream
of
very
fine
water
;
another
great
convenience
for
shipping
.
<EOS>
on
the
side
of
the
mole
,
there
be
a
constant
guard
of
soldier
,
and
a
battery
of
seven
cannon
,
point
to
the
sea
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
side
,
there
be
a
curious
manufacture
for
twisting
or
reel
silk
;
a
tavern
,
a
coffee
-
house
,
and
several
other
building
,
for
the
convenience
of
the
sea
-
fare
people
.
<EOS>
without
the
harbour
,
be
a
lazarette
,
where
person
come
from
infected
place
,
be
oblige
to
perform
quarantine
.
<EOS>
the
harbour
have
be
declare
a
free
-
port
,
and
it
be
generally
full
of
tartan
,
polacre
,
and
other
small
vessel
,
that
come
from
Sardinia
,
Ivica
,
Italy
,
and
Spain
,
load
with
salt
,
wine
,
and
other
commodity
;
but
here
be
no
trade
of
any
great
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
the
city
of
Nice
be
provide
with
a
senate
,
which
administer
justice
under
the
auspex
of
an
avocat
-
general
,
send
hither
by
the
king
.
<EOS>
the
internal
oeconomy
of
the
town
be
manage
by
four
consul
;
one
for
the
noblesse
.
<EOS>
another
for
the
merchant
,
a
third
for
the
bourgeois
,
and
a
fourth
for
the
peasant
.
<EOS>
these
be
choose
annually
from
the
town
-
council
.
<EOS>
They
keep
the
street
and
market
in
order
,
and
superintend
the
public
work
.
<EOS>
there
be
also
an
intendant
,
who
take
care
of
his
majesty
's
revenue
:
but
there
be
a
discretionary
power
lodge
in
the
person
of
the
commandant
,
who
be
always
an
officer
of
rank
in
the
service
,
and
have
under
his
immediate
command
the
regiment
which
be
here
in
garrison
.
<EOS>
that
which
be
here
now
be
a
swiss
battalion
,
of
which
the
king
have
five
or
six
in
his
service
.
<EOS>
there
be
likewise
a
regiment
of
militia
,
which
be
exercise
once
a
year
.
<EOS>
but
of
all
these
particular
,
I
shall
speak
more
fully
on
another
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
stand
upon
the
rampart
,
and
look
round
me
,
I
can
scarce
help
think
myself
inchanted
.
<EOS>
the
small
extent
of
country
which
I
see
,
be
all
cultivate
like
a
garden
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
plain
present
nothing
but
garden
,
full
of
green
tree
,
load
with
orange
,
lemon
,
citron
,
and
bergamot
,
which
make
a
delightful
appearance
.
<EOS>
if
you
examine
them
more
nearly
,
you
will
find
plantation
of
green
pease
ready
to
gather
;
all
sort
of
sallading
,
and
pot
-
herb
,
in
perfection
;
and
plat
of
rose
,
carnation
,
ranunculas
,
anemonie
,
and
daffodil
,
blow
in
full
glory
,
with
such
beauty
,
vigour
,
and
perfume
,
as
no
flower
in
England
ever
exhibit
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
,
that
present
of
carnation
be
send
from
hence
,
in
the
winter
,
to
Turin
and
Paris
;
nay
,
sometimes
as
far
as
London
,
by
the
post
.
<EOS>
They
be
pack
up
in
a
wooden
box
,
without
any
sort
of
preparation
,
one
press
upon
another
:
the
person
who
receive
them
,
cut
off
a
little
bit
of
the
stalk
,
and
steep
them
for
two
hour
in
vinegar
and
water
,
when
they
recover
their
full
bloom
and
beauty
.
<EOS>
then
he
place
them
in
water
-
bottle
,
in
an
apartment
where
they
be
screen
from
the
severity
of
the
weather
;
and
they
will
continue
fresh
and
unfade
the
good
part
of
a
month
.
  
<EOS>
amidst
the
plantation
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Nice
,
appear
a
vast
number
of
white
bastide
,
or
country
-
house
,
which
make
a
dazzling
shew
.
<EOS>
some
few
of
these
be
good
villas
,
belong
to
the
noblesse
of
this
county
;
and
even
some
of
the
bourgeois
be
provide
with
pretty
lodgeable
cassine
;
but
in
general
,
they
be
the
habitation
of
the
peasant
,
and
contain
nothing
but
misery
and
vermin
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
build
square
;
and
,
be
whiten
with
lime
or
plaister
,
contribute
greatly
to
the
richness
of
the
view
.
<EOS>
the
hill
be
shade
to
the
top
with
olive
-
tree
,
which
be
always
green
;
and
those
hill
be
over
-
top
by
more
distant
mountain
,
cover
with
snow
.
<EOS>
when
I
turn
myself
towards
the
sea
,
the
view
be
bound
by
the
horizon
;
yet
in
a
clear
morning
,
one
can
perceive
the
high
land
of
Corsica
.
<EOS>
on
the
right
hand
,
it
be
terminate
by
Antibes
,
and
the
mountain
of
Esterelles
,
which
I
describe
in
my
last
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
weather
,
you
will
conclude
,
from
what
I
have
say
of
the
orange
,
flower
,
etc
.
<EOS>
that
it
must
be
wonderfully
mild
and
serene
:
<EOS>
but
of
the
climate
,
I
shall
speak
hereafter
.
<EOS>
let
me
only
observe
,
en
passant
,
that
the
house
in
general
have
no
chimnie
,
but
in
their
kitchen
;
and
that
many
people
,
even
of
condition
,
at
Nice
,
have
no
fire
in
their
chamber
,
during
the
whole
winter
.
<EOS>
when
the
weather
happen
to
be
a
little
more
sharp
than
usual
,
they
warm
their
apartment
with
a
brasiere
or
pan
of
charcoal
.
  
<EOS>
though
Nice
itself
retain
few
mark
of
antient
splendor
,
there
be
considerable
monument
of
antiquity
in
its
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
about
two
short
mile
from
the
town
,
upon
the
summit
of
a
pretty
high
hill
,
we
find
the
ruin
of
the
antient
city
cemenelion
,
now
call
Cimia
,
which
be
once
the
metropolis
of
the
Maritime
Alps
,
and
the
scat
of
a
roman
president
.
<EOS>
with
respect
to
situation
,
nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
or
salubrious
.
<EOS>
It
stand
upon
the
gentle
ascent
and
summit
of
a
hill
,
front
the
Mediterranean
;
from
the
shore
of
which
,
it
be
distant
about
half
a
league
;
and
,
on
the
other
side
,
it
overlook
a
bottom
,
or
narrow
vale
,
through
which
the
Paglion
(
antiently
call
Paulo
)
<EOS>
run
towards
the
wall
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
It
be
inhabit
by
a
people
,
whom
Ptolomy
and
Pliny
call
the
Vedantij
:
but
<EOS>
these
be
undoubtedly
mixed
with
a
roman
colony
,
as
appear
by
the
monument
which
still
remain
;
I
mean
the
ruin
of
an
amphitheatre
,
a
temple
of
Apollo
,
bath
,
aqueduct
,
sepulchral
,
and
other
stone
,
with
inscription
,
and
a
great
number
of
medal
which
the
peasant
have
find

<EOS>
the
amphitheatre
of
Cemenelion
be
but
very
small
,
compare
to
that
of
Nismes
.
<EOS>
the
arena
be
plough
up
,
and
bear
corn
:
some
of
the
seat
remain
,
and
part
of
two
opposite
porticos
;
but
all
the
column
,
and
the
external
facade
of
the
building
,
be
take
away
so
that
it
be
impossible
to
judge
of
the
architecture
,
all
we
can
perceive
be
,
that
it
be
build
in
an
oval
form
.
<EOS>
about
one
hundred
pace
from
the
amphitheatre
stand
an
antient
temple
,
suppose
to
have
be
dedicate
to
Apollo
.
<EOS>
the
original
roof
be
demolish
,
as
well
as
the
portico
;
the
vestige
of
which
may
still
be
trace
.

the
part
call
the
Basilica

about
one
half
of

Cella
Sanctior

remain

be
convert

garden
,
in
which
this

stand

<EOS>
in
the
Cella
Sanctior
,
I
find
a
lean
cow
,
a
he

goat
,
and
a
jack
-
ass
;
the
very
same
conjunction
of
animal
which
I
have
see
draw
a
plough
in
Burgundy
.
<EOS>
several
mutilated
statue
have
be
dig
up
from
the
ruin
of
this
temple
;
and
a
great
number
of
medal
have
be
find
in
the
different
vineyard
which
now
occupy
the
space
upon
which
stand
the
antient
city

Cemenelion

<EOS>
these
be
of
gold
,
silver
,
and
brass

<EOS>
many
of
them
be
present

Charles
Emanuel
I

duke
of
Savoy

<EOS>
the
prince
of
Monaco
have
a
good
number
of
them
in
his
collection
;
and
the
rest
be
in
private
hand
.
<EOS>
the
peasant
,
in
digging
,
have
likewise
find
many
urn
,
lachrymatorie
,
and
sepulchral
stone
,
with
epitaph
,
which
be
now
disperse
among
different
convent
and
private
house
.
<EOS>
all
this
ground
be
a
rich
mine
of
antiquity
,
which
,
if
properly
work
,
would
produce
a
great
number
of
valuable
curiosity
.
<EOS>
just
by
the
temple
of
Apollo
be
the
ruin
of
a
bath
,
compose
of
great
block
of
marble
,
which
have
be
take
away
for
the
purpose
of
modern
building
.
<EOS>
in
all
probability
,
many
other
noble
monument
of
this
city
have
be
dilapidate
by
the
same
barbarous
oeconomy
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
subterranean
vault
,
through
which
the
water
be
conduct
to
this
bath
,
still
extant
in
the
garden
of
the
count

Gubernatis
.
<EOS>
of
the
aqueduct
that
convey
water
to
the
town
,
I
can
say
very
little
,
but
that
it
be
scoop
through
a
mountain
:
that
this
subterranean
passage
be
discover
some
year
ago
,
by
remove
the
rubbish
which
choake
it
up
:
that
the
people
penetrate
a
considerable
way
,
by
the
help
of
light
torch

find
a
very
plentiful
stream
of
water
flow

aqueduct
,
as
high
as
an
ordinary
man
,
arch
over
head
,
and
line
with
a
sort
of
cement
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
,
however
,
trace
this
stream
to
its
source
;
and
it
be
again
stop
up
with
earth
and
rubbish
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
soul
in
this
country
,
who
have
either
spirit
or
understanding
to
conduct
an
inquiry
of
this
kind
.
<EOS>
hard
by
the
amphitheatre
be
a
convent
of
recollet
,
build
in
a
very
romantic
situation
,
on
the
brink
of
a
precipice
.
<EOS>
on
one
side
of
their
garden
,
they
ascend
to
a
kind
of
esplanade
,
which
they
say
be
part
of
the
citadel
of
Cemenelion
.
<EOS>
They
have
plant
it
with
cypress
-
tree
,
and
flowering
-
shrub
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
monk
tell
me
,
that
it
be
vault
below
,
as
they
can
plainly
perceive
by
the
sound
of
their
instrument
use
in
houghe
the
ground
.
<EOS>
a
very
small
expence
would
bring
the
secret
of
this
cavern
to
light
.
<EOS>
They
have
nothing
to
do
,
but
to
make
a
breach
in
the
wall
,
which
appear
uncover
towards
the
garden
.
  
<EOS>
the
city
of
Cemenelion
be
first
sack
by
the
Longobards
,
who
make
an
irruption
into
Provence
,
under
their
king
Alboinus
,
about
the
middle
of
the
sixth
century
.
<EOS>
It
be
afterwards
totally
destroy
by
the
Saracens
,
who
,
at
different
time
,
ravage
this
whole
coast
.
<EOS>
the
remain
of
the
people
be
suppose
to
have
change
their
habitation
,
and
form
a
coalition
with
the
inhabitant
of
Nice
.
  
<EOS>
what
further
I
have
to
say
of
Nice
,
you
shall
know
in
good
time
;
at
present
,
I
have
nothing
to
add

what

very

<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
last
Sunday
I
cross
Montalban
on
horseback
,
with
some
swiss
officer
,
on
a
visit
to
our
consul
,
Mr
B
 
d
,
who
live
at
Ville
Franche
,
about
half
a
league
from
Nice
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
small
town
,
build
upon
the
side
of
a
rock
,
at
the
bottom
of
the
harbour
,
which
be
a
fine
basin
,
surround
with
hill
on
every
side
,
except
to
the
south
,
where
it
lie
open
to
the
sea
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
a
small
island
in
the
mouth
of
it
,
to
break
off
the
force
of
the
wave
,
when
the
wind
be
southerly
,
it
would
be
one
of
the
fine
harbour
in
the
world
;
for
the
ground
be
exceed
good
for
anchorage
:
there
be
a
sufficient
depth
of
water
,
and
room
enough
for
the
whole
navy
of
England
.
<EOS>
on
the
right
hand
,
as
you
enter
the
port
,
there
be
an
elegant
fanal
,
or
lighthouse
,
keep
in
good
repair
:
but
in
all
the
chart
of
this
coast
which
I
have
see
,
this
lanthorn
be
lay
down
to
the
westward
of
the
harbour
;
an
error
equally
absurd
and
dangerous
,
as
it
may
mislead
the
navigator
,
and
induce
him
to
run
his
ship
among
the
rock
,
to
the
eastward
of
the
lighthouse
,
where
it
would
undoubtedly
perish
.
<EOS>
opposite
to
the
mouth
of
the
harbour
be
the
fort
,
which
can
be
of
no
service
,
but
in
defend
the
shipping
and
the
town
by
sea
;
for
,
by
land
,
it
be
command
by
Montalban
,
and
all
the
hill
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
in
the
war
of
1744
,
it
be
take
and
retake
.
<EOS>
at
present
,
it
be
in
tolerable
good
repair
.
<EOS>
on
the
left
of
the
fort
,
be
the
basin
for
the
gallie
,
with
a
kind
of
dock
,
in
which
they
be
build
,
and
occasionally
lay
up
to
be
refit
.
<EOS>
this
basin
be
form
by
a
pretty
stone
mole
;
and
here
his
sardinian
majesty
's
two
gallie
lie
perfectly
secure
,
moor
with
their
stern
close
to
the
jette
.
<EOS>
I
go
on
board
one
of
these
vessel
,
and
see
about
two
hundred
miserable
wretch
,
chain
to
the
bank
on
which
they
sit
and
row
,
when
the
galley
be
at
sea
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
sight
which
a
british
subject
,
sensible
of
the
blessing
he
enjoy
,
can
not
behold
without
horror
and
compassion
.
<EOS>
not
but
that
if
we
consider
the
nature
of
the
case
,
with
coolness
and
deliberation
,
we
must
acknowledge
the
justice
,
and
even
sagacity
,
of
employ
for
the
service
of
the
public
,
those
malefactor
who
have
forfeit
their
title
to
the
privilege
of
the
community
.
<EOS>
among
the
slave
at
Ville
Franche
be
a
piedmontese
count
,
condemn
to
the
gallie
for
life
,
in
consequence
of
have
be
convict
of
forgery
.
<EOS>
He
be
permit
to
live
on
shore
;
and
get
money
by
employ
the
other
slave
to
knit
stocking
for
sale
.
<EOS>
He
appear
always
in
the
turkish
habit
,
and
be
in
a
fair
way
of
raise
a
well
fortune
than
that
which
he
have
forfeit
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
pity
,
however
,
and
a
manifest
outrage
against
the
law
of
nation
,
as
well
as
of
humanity
,
to
mix
with
those
bandit
,
the
moorish
and
turkish
prisoner
who
be
take
in
the
prosecution
of
open
war
.
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
no
justification
of
this
barbarous
practice
,
that
the
christian
prisoner
be
treat
as
cruelly
at
Tunis
and
Algiers
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
for
the
honour
of
Christendom
,
to
set
an
example
of
generosity
to
the
Turks
;
and
,
if
they
would
not
follow
it
,
to
join
their
naval
force
,
and
extirpate
at
once
those
nest
of
pirate
,
who
have
so
long
infest
the
Mediterranean
.
<EOS>
certainly
,
nothing
can
be
more
shameful
,
than
the
treaty
which
France
and
the
Maritime
Powers
have
conclude
with
those
barbarian
.
<EOS>
They
supply
them
with
artillery
,
arm
,
and
ammunition
,
to
disturb
their
neighbour
.
<EOS>
They
even
pay
them
a
sort
of
tribute
,
under
the
denomination
of
present
;
and
often
put
up
with
insult
tamely
,
for
the
sordid
consideration
of
a
little
gain
in
the
way
of
commerce
.
<EOS>
They
know
that
Spain
,
Sardinia
,
and
almost
all
the
catholic
power
in
the
Mediterranean
,
Adriatic
,
and
Levant
,
be
at
perpetual
war
with
those
Mahometans
;
that
while
Algiers
,
Tunis
,
and
Sallee
,
maintain
armed
cruiser
at
sea
,
those
christian
power
will
not
run
the
risque
of
trading
in
their
own
bottom
,
but
rather
employ
as
carrier
the
maritime
nation
,
who
be
at
peace
with
the
infidel
.
<EOS>
It
be
for
our
share
of
this
advantage
,
that
we
cultivate
the
piratical
States
of
Barbary
,
and
meanly
purchase
passport
of
them
,
thus
acknowledge
them
master
of
the
Mediterranean
.
  
<EOS>
the
sardinian
gallie
be
mount
each
with
five
-
and
-
twenty
oar
,
and
six
gun
,
six
-
pounder
,
of
a
side
,
and
a
large
piece
of
artillery
amidship
,
point
ahead
,
which
(
so
far
as
I
be
able
to
judge
)
can
never
be
use
point
-
blank
,
without
demolish
the
head
or
prow
of
the
galley
.
<EOS>
the
accommodation
on
board
for
the
officer
be
wretched
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
paltry
cabin
in
the
poop
for
the
commander
;
but
all
the
other
officer
lie
below
the
slave
,
in
a
dungeon
,
where
they
have
neither
light
,
air
,
nor
any
degree
of
quiet
;
half
suffocate
by
the
heat
of
the
place
;
torment
by
flea
,
bug
,
and
lice
;
and
disturb
by
the
incessant
noise
over
head
.
<EOS>
the
slave
lie
upon
the
naked
bank
,
without
any
other
covering
than
a
tilt
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
no
great
hardship
,
in
a
climate
where
there
be
scarce
any
winter
.
<EOS>
They
be
feed
with
a
very
scanty
allowance
of
bread
,
and
about
fourteen
bean
a
day
and
twice
a
week
<EOS>
they
have
a
little
rice
,
or
cheese
,
but
most
of
them
,
while
they
be
in
harbour
knit
stocking
,
or
do
some
other
kind
of
work
,
which
enable
them
to
make
some
addition
to
this
wretched
allowance
.
<EOS>
when
they
happen
to
be
at
sea
in
bad
weather
,
their
situation
be
truly
deplorable
.
<EOS>
every
wave
break
over
the
vessel
,
and
not
only
keep
them
continually
wet
,
but
come
with
such
force
,
that
they
be
dash
against
the
bank
with
surprising
violence
:
sometimes
their
limb
be
broke
,
and
sometimes
their
brain
dash
out
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
(
they
say
)
to
keep
such
a
number
of
desperate
people
under
any
regular
command
,
without
exercise
such
severity
as
must
shock
humanity
.
<EOS>
It
be
almost
equally
impossible
to
maintain
any
tolerable
degree
of
cleanliness
,
where
such
a
number
of
wretch
be
croude
together
without
convenience
,
or
even
the
necessary
of
life
.
<EOS>
They
be
order
twice
a
week
to
strip
,
clean
,
and
bathe
themselves
in
the
sea
:
but
,
notwithstanding
all
the
precaution
of
discipline
,
they
swarm
with
vermin
,
and
the
vessel
smell
like
an
hospital
,
or
croude
jail
.
<EOS>
They
seem
,
nevertheless
,
quite
insensible
of
their
misery
,
like
so
many
convict
in
Newgate
:
they
laugh
and
sing
,
and
swear
,
and
get
drunk
when
they
can
.
<EOS>
when
you
enter
by
the
stern
,
you
be
welcome
by
a
band
of
music
select
from
the
slave
;
and
these
expect
a
gratification
.
<EOS>
if
you
walk
forwards
,
you
must
take
care
of
your
pocket
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
accost
by
one
or
other
of
the
slave
,
with
a
brush
and
blacking
-
ball
for
clean
your
shoe
;
and
if
you
undergo
this
operation
,
it
be
ten
to
one
<EOS>
but
your
pocket
be
pick
.
<EOS>
if
you
decline
his
service
,
and
keep
aloof
,
you
will
find
it
almost
impossible
to
avoid
a
colony
of
vermin
,
which
these
fellow
have
a
very
dexterous
method
of
convey
to
stranger
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
turkish
prisoner
,
whose
ransom
or
exchange
be
expect
,
be
allow
to
go
ashore
,
under
proper
inspection
;
and
those
forcat
,
who
have
serve
the
good
part
of
the
time
for
which
they
be
condemn
,
be
employ
in
public
work
,
under
a
guard
of
soldier
.
<EOS>
at
the
harbour
of
Nice
,
they
be
hire
by
ship
-
master
to
bring
ballast
,
and
have
a
small
proportion
of
what
they
earn
,
for
their
own
use
:
the
rest
belong
to
the
king
.
<EOS>
They
be
distinguish
by
an
iron
shackle
about
one
of
their
leg
.
<EOS>
the
road
from
Nice
to
Ville
Franche
be
scarce
passable
on
horseback
:
a
circumstance
the
more
extraordinary
,
as
those
slave
,
in
the
space
of
two
or
three
month
,
may
even
make
it
fit
for
a
carriage
,
and
the
king
would
not
be
one
farthe
out
of
pocket
,
for
they
be
quite
idle
the
great
part
of
the
year
.
  
<EOS>
the
gallie
go
to
sea
only
in
the
summer
.
<EOS>
in
tempestuous
weather
,
they
could
not
live
out
of
port
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
they
be
good
for
nothing
but
in
smooth
water
during
a
calm
;
when
,
by
dint
of
rowing
,
they
make
good
way
.
<EOS>
the
king
of
Sardinia
be
so
sensible
of
their
inutility
,
that
he
intend
to
let
his
gallie
rot
;
and
,
in
lieu
of
them
,
have
purchase
two
large
frigate
in
England
,
one
of
fifty
,
and
another
of
thirty
gun
,
which
be
now
in
the
harbour
of
Ville
Franche
.
<EOS>
He
have
also
procure
an
english
officer
,
one
<EOS>
Mr
A
 
,
who
be
second
in
command
on
board
of
one
of
them
,
and
have
the
title
of
captain
consulteur
,
that
is
,
instructor
to
the
first
captain
,
the
marquis
de
M
 
i
,
who
know
as
little
of
seamanship
as
I
do
of
Arabic
.
  
<EOS>
the
king
,
it
be
say
,
intend
to
have
two
or
three
more
frigate
,
and
then
he
will
be
more
than
a
match
for
the
Barbary
corsair
,
provide
care
be
take
to
man
his
fleet
in
a
proper
manner
:
but
this
will
never
be
do
,
unless
he
invite
foreigner
into
his
service
,
officer
as
well
as
seaman
;
for
his
own
dominion
produce
neither
at
present
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
really
determined
to
make
the
most
of
the
maritime
situation
of
his
dominion
,
as
well
as
of
his
alliance
with
Great
-
Britain
,
he
ought
to
supply
his
ship
with
english
mariner
,
and
put
a
british
commander
at
the
head
of
his
fleet
.
<EOS>
He
ought
to
erect
magazine
and
dock
at
Villa
Franca
;
or
if
there
be
not
conveniency
for
building
,
he
may
at
least
have
pit
and
wharf
for
heave
down
and
careen
;
and
these
ought
to
be
under
the
direction
of
Englishmen
,
who
best
understand
all
the
particular
of
marine
oeconomy
.
<EOS>
without
all
doubt
,
he
will
not
be
able
to
engage
foreigner
,
without
give
them
liberal
appointment
;
and
their
be
engage
in
his
service
will
give
umbrage
to
his
own
subject
:
<EOS>
but
,
when
the
business
be
to
establish
a
maritime
power
,
these
consideration
ought
to
be
sacrifice
to
reason
of
public
utility
.
<EOS>
nothing
can
be
more
absurd
and
unreasonable
,
than
the
murmur
of
the
piedmontese
officer
at
the
preferment
of
foreigner
,
who
execute
those
thing
for
the
advantage
of
their
country
,
of
which
they
know
themselves
incapable
.
<EOS>
when
Mr
P
 
n
be
first
promote
in
the
service
of
his
sardinian
majesty
,
he
meet
with
great
opposition
,
and
numberless
mortification
,
from
the
jealousy
of
the
piedmontese
officer
,
and
be
oblige
to
hazard
his
life
in
many
rencounter
with
them
,
before
they
would
be
quiet
.
<EOS>
be
a
man
of
uncommon
spirit
,
he
never
suffer
the
least
insult
or
affront
to
pass
unchastised
.
<EOS>
He
have
repeat
opportunity
of
signalize
his
valour
against
the
Turks
;
and
by
dint
of
extraordinary
merit
,
and
long
service
not
only
attain
the
chief
command
of
the
gallie
,
with
the
rank
of
lieutenant
-
general
,
but
also
acquire
a
very
considerable
share
of
the
king
's
favour
,
and
be
appoint
commandant
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
His
sardinian
majesty
find
his
account
more
way
than
one
,
in
thus
promote
Mr
P
 
<EOS>
n.
He
make
the
acquisition
of
an
excellent
officer
,
of
try
courage
and
fidelity
,
by
whose
advice
he
conduct
his
marine
affair
.
<EOS>
this
gentleman
be
perfectly
well
esteem
at
the
court
of
London
.
<EOS>
in
the
war
of
1744
,
he
live
in
the
utmost
harmony
with
the
british
admiral
who
command
our
fleet
in
the
Mediterranean
.
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
good
understanding
,
a
thousand
occasional
service
be
perform
by
the
english
ship
,
for
the
benefit
of
his
master
,
which
otherwise
could
not
have
be
do
,
without
a
formal
application
to
our
ministry
;
in
which
case
,
the
opportunity
would
have
be
lose
.
<EOS>
I
know
our
admiral
have
general
order
and
instruction
,
to
cooperate
in
all
thing
with
his
sardinian
majesty
;
but
I
know
,
also
,
by
experience
,
how
little
these
general
instruction
avail
,
when
the
admiral
be
not
cordially
interested
in
the
service
.
<EOS>
be
the
king
of
Sardinia
at
present
engage
with
England
in
a
new
war
against
France
,
and
a
british
squadron
station
upon
this
coast
,
as
formerly
,
he
would
find
a
great
difference
in
this
particular
.
<EOS>
He
should
therefore
carefully
avoid
have
at
Nice
a
Savoyard
commandant
,
utterly
ignorant
of
sea
affair
;
unacquainted
with
the
true
interest
of
his
master
;
proud
,
and
arbitrary
;
reserve
to
stranger
,
from
a
prejudice
of
national
jealousy
;
and
particularly
averse
to
the
English
.
  
<EOS>
with
respect
to
the
antient
name
of
Villa
Franca
,
there
be
a
dispute
among
antiquarian
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
at
all
mention
in
the
Itinerarium
of
Antoninus
,
unless
it
be
mean
as
the
port
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
more
surprising
,
that
the
accurate
Strabo
,
in
describe
this
coast
,
mention
no
such
harbour
.
<EOS>
some
people
imagine
it
be
the
Portus
Herculis
Monaeci
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
undoubtedly
what
be
now
call
Monaco
;
the
harbour
of
which
exactly
tally
with
what
Strabo
say
of
the
Portus
Monaeci
  
neque
magna
,
neque
multas

<EOS>
,
It
hold
but
<EOS>
a
few
vessel
and
those
of
small
burthen
.
<EOS>
ptolomy
,
indeed
,
seem
to
mention
it
under
the
name
of
Herculis
Portus
,
different
from
the
Portus
Monaeci
.
<EOS>
His
word
be
these
:
post

Ligustrium
mare
,
massiliensium
,

Nicaea
,
Herculis
Portus
,
Trophaea

<EOS>
beyond
the

of
the
Var
upon
the
Ligurian
Coast
,
the
Marsilian
Colonies
be
nice
,
Port
Hercules
,
Trophaea
and
Monaco
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
,
Hercules
be
worship
both
here
and
at
Monaco
,
and
give
his
name
to
both
place
.
<EOS>
but
on
this
subject
,
I
shall
perhaps
speak
more
fully
in
another
letter
,
after
I
have
see
the
Trophaea
Augusti
,
now
call
Tourbia
,
and
the
town
of
Monaco
,
which
last
be
about
three
league
from
Nice
.
<EOS>
here
I
can
not
help
take
notice
of
the
follow
elegant
description
from
the
Pharsalia
,
which
seem
to
have
be
intend
for
this
very

the

in
the
thirteenth
century
,
by
order
of
Charles
II
,
king
of

in
order
to
defend
the

at

in

of
plain
ground
within
a
mile
of
it
.
<EOS>
in
summer
,
the
reflexion
of
the
sun
from
the
rock
must
make
it
intolerably
hot
;
for
even
at
this
time
of
the
year
,
I
walk
myself
into
a
profuse
sweat
,
by
go
about
a
quarter
of
a

to
see
the
gallie
.
  
<EOS>
pray
remember
me
to
our

and
believe
me
to
be
ever
yours

NICE

<EOS>
MADAM
,
 
<EOS>
in
your
favour
which
I
receive
by
Mr
M
 
l
,
you
remind
me
of
my
promise
,
to
communicate
the
remark
I
have
still
to
make
on
the
french
nation
;
and
at
the
same
time
you
signify
your
opinion
,
that
I
be
too
severe
in
my
former
observation
.
<EOS>
You
even
hint
a
suspicion
,
that
this
severity
be
owe
to
some
personal
cause
of
resentment
;
but
,
I
protest
,
I
have
no
particular
cause
of
animosity
against
any
individual
of
that
country
.
<EOS>
I
have
neither
obligation
to
,
nor
quarrel
with
,
any
subject
of
France
;
and
when
I
meet
with
a
Frenchman
worthy
of
my
esteem
,
I
can
receive
him
into
my
friendship
with
as
much
cordiality
,
as
I
could
feel
for
any
fellow
-
citizen
of
the
same
merit
.
<EOS>
I
even
respect
the
nation
,
for
the
number
of
great
man
it
have
produce
in
all
art
and
science
.
<EOS>
I
respect
the
french
officer
,
in
particular
,
for
their
gallantry
and
valour
;
and
especially
for
that
generous
humanity
which
they
exercise
towards
their
enemy
,
even
amidst
the
horror
of
war
.
<EOS>
this
liberal
spirit
be
the
only
circumstance
of
antient
chivalry
,
which
I
think
be
worth
preserve
.
<EOS>
It
have
formerly
flourish
in
England
,
but
be
almost
extinguish
in
a
succession
of
civil
war
,
which
be
always
productive
of
cruelty
and
rancour
.
<EOS>
It
be
Henry
IV
of
France
,
(
a
real
knight
errant
)
who
revive
it
in
Europe
.
<EOS>
He
possess
that
greatness
of
mind
,
which
can
forgive
injury
of
the
deep
dye
:
and
as
he
have
also
the
faculty
of
distinguish
character
,
he
find
his
account
,
in
favour
with
his
friendship
and
confidence
,
some
of
those
who
have
oppose
him
in
the
field
with
the
most
inveterate
perseverance
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
he
do
more
service
to
mankind
in
general
,
by
revive
the
practice
of
treat
his
prisoner
with
generosity
,
than
he
prejudice
his
own
country
by
patronize
the
absurd
and
pernicious
custom
of
duelling
,
and
establish
a
punto
,
found
in
diametrical
opposition
to
common
sense
and
humanity
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
often
hear
it
observe
,
that
a
french
officer
be
generally
an
agreeable
companion
when
he
be
turn
of
fifty
.
<EOS>
without
all
doubt
,
by
that
time
,
the
fire
of
his
vivacity
,
which
make
him
so
troublesome
in
his
youth
,
will
be
considerably
abate
,
and
in
other
respect
,
he
must
be
improve
by
his
experience
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
fundamental
error
in
the
first
principle
of
his
education
,
<EOS>
which
time
rather
confirm
than
remove
.
<EOS>
early
prejudice
be
for
the
most
part
convert
into
habit
of
thinking
;
and
accordingly
you
will
find
the
old
officer
in
the
french
service
more
bigotted
than
their
junior
,
to
the
punctilio
of
false
honour
.
  
<EOS>
a
lad
of
a
good
family
no
sooner
enter
into
the
service
,
than
he
think
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
shew
his
courage
in
a
rencontre
.
<EOS>
His
natural
vivacity
prompt
him
to
hazard
in
company
every
thing
that
come
uppermost
,
without
any
respect
to
his
senior
or
better
;
and
ten
to
one
<EOS>
but
he
say
something
,
which
he
find
it
necessary
to
maintain
with
his
sword
.
<EOS>
the
old
officer
,
instead
of
check
his
petulance
,
either
by
rebuke
or
silent
disapprobation
,
seem
to
be
pleased
with
his
impertinence
,
and
encourage
every
sally
of
his
presumption
.
<EOS>
Should
a
quarrel
ensue
,
and
the
party
go
out
,
he
make
no
effort
to
compromise
the
dispute
;
but
sit
with
a
pleasing
expectation
to
learn
the
issue
of
the
rencontre
.
<EOS>
if
the
young
man
be
wound
,
he
kiss
him
with
transport
,
extol
his
bravery
,
put
him
into
the
hand
of
the
surgeon
,
and
visit
him
with
great
tenderness
every
day
,
until
he
be
cure
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
kill
on
the
spot
,
he
shrug
up
his
shoulder
 
say
,
quelle
dommage
!
<EOS>
c'etoit
un
amiable
enfant
!
<EOS>
ah
,
patience
!
<EOS>
what
pity
!
<EOS>
he
be
a
fine
Boy
!
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
helpt
!
<EOS>
and
in
three
hour
the
defunct
be
forget
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
in
France
,
duel
be
forbid
,
on
pain
of
death
:
but
this
law
be
easily
evade
.
<EOS>
the
person
insult
walk
out
;
the
antagonist
understand
the
hint
,
and
follow
him
into
the
street
,
where
they
justle
as
if
by
accident
,
draw
their
sword
,
and
one
of
them
be
either
kill
or
disable
,
before
any
effectual
mean
can
be
use
to
part
them
.
<EOS>
whatever
may
be
the
issue
of
the
combat
,
the
magistrate
take
no
cognizance
of
it
;
at
least
,
it
be
interpret
into
an
accidental
rencounter
,
and
no
penalty
be
incur
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
thus
the
purpose
of
the
law
be
entirely
defeat
,
by
a
most
ridiculous
and
cruel
connivance
.
<EOS>
the
meerest
trifle
in
conversation
,
a
rash
word
,
a
distant
hint
,
even
a
look
or
smile
of
contempt
,
be
sufficient
to
produce
one
of
these
combat
;
but
injury
of
a
deep
dye
,
such
as
term
of
reproach
,
the
lie
direct
,
a
blow
,
or
even
the
menace
of
a
blow
,
must
be
discuss
with
more
formality
.
<EOS>
in
any
of
these
case
,
the
party
agree
to
meet
in
the
dominion
of
another
prince
,
where
they
can
murder
each
other
,
without
fear
of
punishment
.
<EOS>
an
officer
who
be
strike
,
or
even
threaten
with
a
blow
must
not
be
quiet
,
until
he
either
kill
his
antagonist
,
or
lose
his
own
life
.
<EOS>
a
friend
of
mine
,
(
a
Nissard
)
who
be
in
the
service
of
France
,
tell
me
,
that
some
year
ago
,
one
of
their
captain
,
in
the
heat
of
passion
,
strike
his
lieutenant
.
<EOS>
They
fight
immediately
:
the
lieutenant
be
wound
and
disarm
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
an
affront
that
could
not
be
make
up
,
he
no
sooner
recover
of
his
wound
,
than
he
call
out
the
captain
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
they
fight
five
time
before
the
combat
prove
decisive
at
last
,
the
lieutenant
be
leave
dead
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
this
be
an
event
which
sufficiently
prove
the
absurdity
of
the
punctilio
that
give
rise
to
it
.
<EOS>
the
poor
gentleman
who
be
insult
,
and
outrage
by
the
brutality
of
the
aggressor
,
find
himself
under
the
necessity
of
give
him
a
further
occasion
to
take
away
his
life
.
<EOS>
another
adventure
of
the
same
kind
happen
a
few
year
ago
in
this
place
.
<EOS>
a
french
officer
have
threaten
to
strike
another
,
a
formal
challenge
ensue
;
and
it
be
agree
that
they
should
fight
until
one
of
them
drop
,
each
provide
himself
with
a
couple
of
pioneer
to
dig
his
grave
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
They
engage
just
without
one
of
the
gate
of
Nice
,
in
presence
of
a
great
number
of
spectator
,
and
fight
with
surprising
fury
,
until
the
ground
be
drench
with
their
blood
.
<EOS>
at
length
one
of
them
stumble
,
and
fall
;
upon
which
the
other
,
who
find
himself
mortally
wound
,
advance
,
and
drop
his
point
,
say
,
"
<EOS>
Je
te
donne
ce
que
tu
m'as
ote
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
will
give
thee
that
which
thou
hast
take
from
me
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
drop
dead
upon
the
field
.
<EOS>
the
other
,
who
have
be
the
person
insulted
,
be
so
dangerously
wound
that
he
could
not
rise
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
spectator
carry
him
forthwith
to
the
beach
,
and
put
him
into
a
boat
,
convey
him
by
sea
to
Antibes
.
<EOS>
the
body
of
his
antagonist
be
deny
christian
burial
,
as
he
die
without
absolution
,
and
every
body
allow
that
his
soul
go
to
hell
:
but
the
gentleman
of
the
army
declare
,
that
he
die
like
a
man
of
honour
.
<EOS>
Should
a
man
be
never
so
well
inclined
to
make
atonement
in
a
peaceable
manner
,
for
an
insult
give
in
the
heat
of
passion
,
or
in
the
fury
of
intoxication
,
it
can
not
be
receive
.
<EOS>
even
an
involuntary
trespass
from
ignorance
,
or
absence
of
mind
,
must
be
cleanse
with
blood
.
<EOS>
a
certain
noble
lord
,
of
our
country
,
when
he
be
yet
a
commoner
,
on
his
travel
,
involve
himself
in
a
dilemma
of
this
sort
,
at
the
court
of
Lorrain
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
ride
out
,
and
stroll
along
a
public
walk
,
in
a
brown
study
,
with
his
horse
-
whip
in
his
hand
,
perceive
a
caterpillar
crawling
on
the
back
of
a
marquis
,
who
chance
to
be
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
never
think
of
the
petit
maitre
;
but
lift
up
his
whip
,
in
order
to
kill
the
insect
,
lay
it
across
his
shoulder
with
a
crack
,
that
alarm
all
the
company
in
the
walk
.
<EOS>
the
marquis
's
sword
be
produce
in
a
moment
,
and
the
aggressor
in
great
hazard
of
his
life
,
as
he
have
no
weapon
of
defence
.
<EOS>
He
be
no
sooner
wake
from
his
reverie
,
than
he
beg
pardon
,
and
offer
to
make
all
proper
concession
for
what
he
have
do
through
mere
inadvertency
.
<EOS>
the
marquis
would
have
admit
his
excuse
,
have
there
be
any
precedent
of
such
an
affront
be
wash
away
without
blood
.
<EOS>
a
conclave
of
honour
be
immediately
assemble
;
and
after
long
dispute
,
they
agree
,
that
an
involuntary
offence
,
especially
from
such
a
kind
of
man
,
d'un
tel
homme
,
may
be
attone
by
concession
.
<EOS>
that
you
may
have
some
idea
of
the
small
beginning
,
from
which
many
gigantic
quarrel
arise
,
I
shall
recount
one
that
lately
happen
at
Lyons
,
as
I
have
it
from
the
mouth
of
a
person
who
be
an
ear
and
eye
witness
of
the
transaction
.
<EOS>
two
frenchman
,
at
a
public
ordinary
,
stun
the
rest
of
the
company
with
their
loquacity
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
one
of
them
,
with
a
supercilious
air
,
ask
the
other
's
name
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
tell
my
name
,
(
say
he
)
but
in
a
whisper
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
may
have
very
good
reason
for
keep
it
secret
,
"
reply
the
first
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
,
"
(
resume
the
other
)
:
with
these
word
he
rise
;
and
go
round
to
him
,
pronounce
,
loud
enough
to
be
hear
by
the
whole
company
,
"
Je
m'appelle
Pierre
Paysan
;
et
vous
ete
un
impertinent
.
"
<EOS>
"
My
name
be
Peter
Peasant
,
and
you
be
an
impertinent
fellow
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
walk
out
:
the
interrogator
follow
him
into
the
street
,
where
they
justle
,
draw
their
sword
,
and
engage
.
<EOS>
He
who
ask
the
question
be
run
through
the
body
;
but
his
relation
be
so
powerful
,
that
the
victor
be
oblige
to
fly
his
country
,
be
try
and
condemn
in
his
absence
;
his
good
be
confiscate
;
his
wife
break
her
heart
;
his
child
be
reduce
to
beggary
;
and
he
himself
be
now
starve
in
exile
.
<EOS>
in
England
we
have
not
yet
adopt
all
the
implacability
of
the
punctilio
.
<EOS>
a
gentleman
may
be
insult
even
with
a
blow
,
and
survive
,
after
have
once
hazard
his
life
against
the
aggressor
.
<EOS>
the
law
of
honour
in
our
country
do
not
oblige
him
either
to
slay
the
person
from
whom
he
receive
the
injury
,
or
even
to
fight
to
the
last
drop
of
his
own
blood
.
<EOS>
one
find
no
example
of
duel
among
the
Romans
,
who
be
certainly
as
brave
and
as
delicate
in
their
notion
of
honour
as
the
French
.
<EOS>
Cornelius
Nepos
tell
us
,
that
a
famous
athenian
general
,
have
a
dispute
with
his
colleague
,
who
be
of
Sparta
,
a
man
of
a
fiery
disposition
,
this
last
lift
up
his
cane
to
strike
him
.
<EOS>
have
this
happen
to
a
french
petit
maitre
,
death
must
have
ensue
:
but
mark
what
follow
 
<EOS>
the
Athenian
,
far
from
resent
the
outrage
,
in
what
be
now
call
a
gentlemanlike
manner
,
say
,
"
do
,
strike
if
you
please
;
but
hear
me
.
"
<EOS>
He
never
dream
of
cut
the
Lacedemonian
's
throat
;
but
bore
with
his
passionate
temper
,
as
the
infirmity
of
a
friend
who
have
a
thousand
good
quality
to
overbalance
that
defect
.
  
<EOS>
I
need
not
expatiate
upon
the
folly
and
the
mischief
which
be
countenance
and
promote
by
the
modern
practice
of
duel
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
give
example
of
friend
who
have
murder
each
other
,
in
obedience
to
this
savage
custom
,
even
while
their
heart
be
melt
with
mutual
tenderness
;
nor
will
I
particularize
the
instance
which
I
myself
know
,
of
whole
family
ruin
,
of
woman
and
child
make
widow
and
orphan
,
of
parent
deprive
of
only
son
,
and
of
valuable
life
lose
to
the
community
,
by
duel
,
which
have
be
produce
by
one
unguarded
expression
,
utter
without
intention
of
offence
,
in
the
heat
of
dispute
and
altercation
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
insist
upon
the
hardship
of
a
worthy
man
's
be
oblige
to
devote
himself
to
death
,
because
it
be
his
misfortune
to
be
insult
by
a
brute
,
a
bully
,
a
drunkard
,
or
a
madman
:
<EOS>
neither
will
I
enlarge
upon
this
side
of
the
absurdity
,
which
indeed
amount
to
a
contradiction
in
term
;
I
mean
the
dilemma
to
which
a
gentleman
in
the
army
be
reduce
,
when
he
receive
an
affront
:
if
he
do
not
challenge
and
fight
his
antagonist
,
he
be
break
with
infamy
by
a
court
-
martial
;
if
he
fight
and
kill
him
,
he
be
try
by
the
civil
power
,
convict
of
murder
,
and
,
if
the
royal
mercy
do
not
interpose
,
he
be
infallibly
hang
:
all
this
,
exclusive
of
the
risque
of
his
own
life
in
the
duel
,
and
his
conscience
be
burthen
with
the
blood
of
a
man
,
whom
perhaps
he
have
sacrifice
to
a
false
punctilio
,
even
contrary
to
his
own
judgment
.
<EOS>
these
be
reflection
which
I
know
your
own
good
sense
will
suggest
,
but
I
will
make
bold
to
propose
a
remedy
for
this
gigantic
evil
,
which
seem
to
gain
ground
everyday
:
let
a
court
be
institute
for
take
cognizance
of
all
breach
of
honour
,
with
power
to
punish
by
fine
,
pillory
,
sentence
of
infamy
,
outlawry
,
and
exile
,
by
virtue
of
an
act
of
parliament
make
for
this
purpose
;
and
all
person
insult
,
shall
have
recourse
to
this
tribunal
:
let
every
man
who
seek
personal
reparation
with
sword
,
pistol
,
or
other
instrument
of
death
,
be
declare
infamous
,
and
banish
the
kingdom
:
let
every
man
,
convict
of
have
use
a
sword
or
pistol
,
or
other
mortal
weapon
,
against
another
,
either
in
duel
or
rencountre
,
occasion
by
any
previous
quarrel
,
be
subject
to
the
same
penalty
:
if
any
man
be
kill
in
a
duel
,
let
his
body
be
hang
upon
a
public
gibbet
,
for
a
certain
time
,
and
then
give
to
the
surgeon
:
let
his
antagonist
be
hang
as
a
murderer
,
and
dissect
also
;
and
some
mark
of
infamy
be
set
on
the
memory
of
both
.
<EOS>
I
apprehend
such
regulation
would
put
an
effectual
stop
to
the
practice
of
duelling
,
which
nothing
but
the
fear
of
infamy
can
support
;
for
I
be
persuade
,
that
no
being
,
capable
of
reflection
,
would
prosecute
the
trade
of
assassination
at
the
risque
of
his
own
life
,
if
this
hazard
be
at
the
same
time
reinforce
by
the
certain
prospect
of
infamy
and
ruin
.
<EOS>
every
person
of
sentiment
would
in
that
case
allow
,
that
an
officer
,
who
in
a
duel
rob
a
deserve
woman
of
her
husband
,
a
number
of
child
of
their
father
,
a
family
of
its
support
,
and
the
community
of
a
fellow
-
citizen
,
have
as
little
merit
to
plead
from
expose
his
own
person
,
as
a
highwayman
,
or
housebreaker
,
who
every
day
risque
his
life
to
rob
or
plunder
that
which
be
not
of
half
the
importance
to
society
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
from
the
Buccaneers
of
America
,
that
the
English
have
learn
to
abolish
one
solecism
in
the
practice
of
duel
:
those
adventurer
decide
their
personal
quarrel
with
pistol
;
and
this
improvement
have
be
adopt
in
Great
Britain
with
good
success
;
though
in
France
,
and
other
part
of
the
continent
,
it
be
look
upon
as
a
proof
of
their
barbarity
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
however
,
the
only
circumstance
of
duelling
,
which
savour
of
common
sense
,
as
it
put
all
mankind
upon
a
level
,
the
old
with
the
young
,
the
weak
with
the
strong
,
the
unwieldy
with
the
nimble
,
and
the
man
who
know
not
how
to
hold
a
sword
with
the
spadassin
,
who
have
practise
fence
from
the
cradle
.
<EOS>
what
glory
be
there
in
a
man
's
vanquish
an
adversary
over
whom
he
have
a
manifest
advantage
?
<EOS>
to
abide
the
issue
of
a
combat
in
this
case
,
do
not
even
require
that
moderate
share
of
resolution
which
nature
have
indulge
to
her
common
child
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
we
have
see
many
instance
of
a
coward
's
provoke
a
man
of
honour
to
battle
.
<EOS>
in
the
reign
of
our
second
Charles
,
when
duel
flourish
in
all
their
absurdity
,
and
the
second
fight
while
their
principal
be
engage
,
Villiers
,
Duke
of
Buckingham
,
not
content
with
have
debauch
the
countess
of
Shrewsbury
and
publish
her
shame
,
take
all
opportunity
of
provoke
the
earl
to
single
combat
,
hope
he
should
have
an
easy
conquest
,
his
lordship
be
a
puny
little
creature
,
quiet
,
inoffensive
,
and
<EOS>
every
way
unfit
for
such
personal
contest
.
<EOS>
He
ridicule
him
on
all
occasion
;
and
at
last
declare
in
public
company
,
that
there
be
no
glory
in
cuckold
Shrewsbury
,
who
have
not
spirit
to
resent
the
injury
.
<EOS>
this
be
an
insult
which
could
not
be
overlook
.
<EOS>
the
earl
send
him
a
challenge
;
and
they
agree
to
fight
,
at
Barns
-
Elms
,
in
presence
of
two
gentleman
,
whom
they
choose
for
their
second
.
<EOS>
all
the
four
engage
at
the
same
time
;
the
first
thrust
be
fatal
to
the
earl
of
Shrewsbury
;
and
his
friend
kill
the
duke
's
second
at
the
same
instant
.
<EOS>
Buckingham
,
elate
with
his
exploit
,
set
out
immediately
for
the
earl
's
seat
at
Cliefden
,
where
he
lie
with
his
wife
,
after
have
boast
of
the
murder
of
her
husband
,
whose
blood
he
shew
her
upon
his
sword
,
as
a
trophy
of
his
prowess
.
<EOS>
but
this
very
duke
of
Buckingham
be
little
well
than
a
poltroon
at
bottom
.
<EOS>
when
the
gallant
earl
of
Ossory
challenge
him
to
fight
in
Chelsea
field
,
he
cross
the
water
to
Battersea
,
where
he
pretend
to
wait
for
his
lordship
;
and
then
complain
to
the
house
of
lords
,
that
Ossory
have
give
him
the
rendezvous
,
and
do
not
keep
his
appointment
.
<EOS>
He
know
the
house
would
interpose
in
the
quarrel
,
and
he
be
not
disappointed
.
<EOS>
Their
lordship
oblige
them
both
to
give
their
word
of
honour
,
that
their
quarrel
should
have
no
other
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
I
ought
to
make
an
apology
for
have
trouble
a
lady
with
so
many
observation
on
a
subject
so
unsuitable
to
the
softness
of

but
I
know
you
can
not

indifferent
to
any
thing
that
so
nearly
affect
the

which
I
can
safely
aver

have

suggest

NICE

<EOS>
DEAR
DOCTOR
,
 
a
few
day
ago
,
I
ride
out
with
two
gentleman
of
this
country
,
to
see
a
stream
of
water
which
be
formerly
convey
in
an
aqueduct
to
the
antient
city
of
Cemenelion
,
from
whence
this
place
be
distant
about
a
mile
,
though
separate
by
abrupt
rock
and
deep
hollow
,
which
last
be
here
honour
with
the
name
of
vallie
.
<EOS>
the
water
,
which
be
exquisitely
cool
,
and
light
and
pure
,
gush
from
the
middle
of
a
rock
by
a
hole
which
lead
to
a
subterranean
aqueduct
carry
through
the
middle
of
the
mountain
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
roman
work
,
and
the
more
I
consider
it
,
appear
the
more
stupendous
.
<EOS>
a
peasant
who
live
upon
the
spot
tell
us
,
he
have
enter
by
this
hole
at
eight
in
the
morning
,
and
advance
so
far
,
that
it
be
four
in
the
afternoon
before
he
come
out
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
walk
in
the
water
,
through
a
regular
canal
form
of
a
hard
stone
,
line
with
a
kind
of
cement
,
and
vault
overhead
;
but
so
high
in
most
part
he
could
stand
upright
,
yet
in
other
,
the
bed
of
the
canal
be
so
fill
with
earth
and
stone
,
that
he
be
oblige
to
stoop
in
pass
.
<EOS>
He
say
that
there
be
air
-
hole
at
certain
distance
(
and
indeed
I
see
one
of
these
not
far
from
the
present
issue
)
that
there
be
some
opening
and
stone
seat
on
the
side
,
and
here
<EOS>
and
there
figure
of
man
form
of
stone
,
with
hammer
and
work
tool
in
their
hand
.
<EOS>
I
be
apt
to
believe
the
fellow
romance
a
little
,
in
order
to
render
his
adventure
the
more
marvellous
:
but
I
be
certainly
inform
,
that
several
person
have
enter
this
passage
,
and
proceed
a
considerable
way
by
the
light
of
torch
,
without
arrive
at
the
source
,
which
(
if
we
may
believe
the
tradition
of
the
country
)
be
at
the
distance
of
eight
league
from
this
opening
;
but
this
be
altogether
incredible
.
<EOS>
the
stream
be
now
call
la
fontaine
de
muraille
,
and
be
carefully
conduct
by
different
branch
into
the
adjacent
vineyard
and
garden
,
for
water
the
ground
.
<EOS>
on
the
side
of
the
same
mountain
,
more
southerly
,
at
the
distance
of
half
a
mile
,
there
be
another
still
more
copious
discharge
of
the
same
kind
of
water
,
call
la
source
du
temple
.
<EOS>
It
be
convey
through
the
same
kind
of
passage
,
and
put
to
the
same
use
as
the
other
;
and
I
should
imagine
they
be
both
from
the
same
source
,
which
,
though
hitherto
undiscovered
,
must
be
at
a
considerable
distance
,
as
the
mountain
be
continue
for
several
league
to
the
westward
,
without
exhibit
the
least
sign
of
water
in
any
other
part
.
<EOS>
but
,
exclusive
of
the
subterranean
conduit
,
both
these
stream
must
have
be
convey
through
aqueduct
extend
from
hence
to
cemenelion
over
steep
rock
and
deep
ravine
,
at
a
prodigious
expence
.
<EOS>
the
water
from
this
source
du
temple
,
issue
from
a
stone
building
which
cover
the
passage
in
the
rock
.
<EOS>
It
serve
to
turn
several
olive
,
corn
,
and
paper
mill
,
be
convey
through
a
modern
aqueduct
raise
upon
paultry
arcade
at
the
expence
of
the
public
,
and
afterwards
be
branch
off
in
very
small
stream
,
for
the
benefit
of
this
parch
and
barren
country
.
<EOS>
the
Romans
be
so
used
to
bathing
,
that
they
could
not
exist
without
a
great
quantity
of
water
;
and
this
<EOS>
,
I
imagine
,
be
one
reason
that
induce
them
to
spare
no
labour
and
expence
in
bring
it
from
a
distance
,
when
they
have
not
plenty
of
it
at
home
.
<EOS>
but
,
besides
this
motive
,
they
have
another
:
they
be
so
nice
and
delicate
in
their
taste
of
water
,
that
they
take
great
pain
to
supply
themselves
with
the
pure
and
light
from
afar
,
for
drinking
and
culinary
use
,
even
while
they
have
plenty
of
an
inferior
sort
for
their
bath
,
and
other
domestic
purpose
.
<EOS>
there
be
spring
of
good
water
on
the
spot
where
cemenelion
stand
:
but
there
be
a
hardness
in
all
well
-
water
,
which
quality
be
deposit
in
run
a
long
course
,
especially
,
if
expose
to
the
influence
of
the
sun
and
air
.
<EOS>
the
Romans
,
therefore
,
have
good
reason
to
soften
and
meliorate
this
element
,
by
convey
it
a
good
length
of
way
in
open
aqueduct
.
<EOS>
what
be
use
in
the
bath
of
Cemenelion
,
they
probably
bring
in
leaden
pipe
,
some
of
which
have
be
dig
up
very
lately
by
accident
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
I
make
a
second
excursion
to
these
antient
ruin
,
and
measure
the
arena
of
the
amphitheatre
with
packthread
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
oval
figure
;
the
long
diameter
extend
to
about
one
hundred
and
thirteen
foot
,
and
the
short
to
eighty
-
eight
;
but
I
will
not
answer
for
the
exactness
of
the
measurement
.
<EOS>
in
the
center
of
it
,
there
be
a
square
stone
,
with
an
iron
ring
,
to
which
I
suppose
the
wild
beast
be
tie
,
to
prevent
their
springing
upon
the
spectator
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
seat
remain
,
the
two
opposite
entrance
,
consist
each
of
one
large
gate
,
and
two
lateral
small
door
,
arch
:
there
be
also
a
considerable
portion
of
the
external
wall
;
but
no
column
,
or
other
ornament
of
architecture
.
<EOS>
hard
by
,
in
the
garden
of
the
count
de
Gubernatis
,
I
see
the
remain
of
a
bath
,
front
the
portal
of
the
temple
,
which
I
have
describe
in
a
former
letter
;
and
here
be
some
shaft
of
marble
pillar
,
particularly
a
capital
of
the
corinthian
order
beautifully
cut
,
of
white
alabaster
.
<EOS>
here
the
count
find
a
large
quantity
of
fine
marble
,
which
he
have
convert
to
various
use
;
and
some
mutilate
statue
,
bronze
as
well
as
marble
.
<EOS>
the
peasant
shew
me
some
brass
and
silver
medal
,
which
he
have
pick
up
at
different
time
in
labour
the
ground
;
together
with
several
oblong
bead
of
coloured
glass
,
which
be
use
as
ear
-
ring
by
the
roman
lady
;
and
a
small
seal
of
agate
,
very
much
deface
.
<EOS>
two
of
the
medal
be
of
Maximian
and
Gallienus
;
the
rest
be
so
consume
,
that
I
could
not
read
the
legend
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
that
on
public
occasion
,
such
as
game
,
and
certain
sacrifice
,
handful
of
medal
be
throw
among
the
people
;
a
practice
,
which
account
for
the
great
number
which
have
be
already
find
in
this
district
.
<EOS>
I
see
some
subterranean
passage
,
which
seem
to
have
be
common
sewer
;
and
a
great
number
of
old
wall
still
stand
along
the
brink
of
a
precipice
,
which
overhang
the
Paglion
.
<EOS>
the
peasant
tell
me
,
that
they
never
dig
above
a
yard
in
depth
,
without
find
vault
or
cavity
.
<EOS>
all
the
vineyard
and
garden
-
ground
,
for
a
considerable
extent
,
be
vault
underneath
;
and
all
the
ground
that
produce
their
grape
,
fruit
,
and
garden
-
stuff
,
be
no
more
than
the
crumpled
lime
and
rubbish
of
old
roman
building
,
mix
with
manure
bring
from
Nice
.
<EOS>
this
antient
town
command
a
most
noble
prospect
of
the
sea
;
but
be
altogether
inaccessible
by
any
kind
of
wheel
carriage
.
<EOS>
if
you
make
shift
to
climb
to
it
on
horseback
,
you
can
not
descend
to
the
plain
again
,
without
run
the
risk
of
break
your
neck
.
  
<EOS>
about
seven
or
eight
mile
on
the
other
side
of
Nice
,
be
the
remain
of
another
roman
monument
which
have
greatly
suffer
from
the
barbarity
of
successive
age
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
trophy
erect
by
the
senate
of
Rome
,
in
honour
of
Augustus
Caesar
,
when
he
have
totally
subdue
all
the
ferocious
nation
of
these
Maritime
Alps
;
such
as
the
Trumpilini
Camuni
,
Vennontes
,
Isnarci
,
Breuni
,
etc
.
<EOS>
It
stand
upon
the
top
of
a
mountain
which
overlook
the
town
of
Monaco
,
and
now
exhibit
the
appearance
of
an
old
ruin
tower
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
description
of
what
it
be
,
in
an
italian
manuscript

by
which
it
appear
to
have
be
a

I
think
I
have
now
describe
all
the
antiquity
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Nice
,
except
some
catacomb
or
cavern

dig
in
a

at
St
Hospice

which
busche
,
in
his
geography
,
have
describe

a
strong

seaport
,
though
in
fact
,
there
be
not
the
least
vestige
either
of
town

<EOS>
It
be
a
point
of
land
almost
opposite
to
the
tower
of
Turbia

with
the
mountain

which
it
form
a

where
there
be
a
great

curious

the
tunny

Sardinia

<EOS>
upon
this
point
there
be
a

give
notice

<EOS>
the

be
in

dig

in

as

of

who
greatly
infest

enter

without
arrive
at

;
and
the
tradition
of
the
country
be
,
that
they
reach
as
far
as
the
ancient
city
of
cemenelion
;
but
this
be
an
idle
supposition

almost
as

which
ascribe
them

:
they
consist
of
narrow

here

there
one
find
detached

small

I
suppose
the

NICE
,
July
2
,
1764
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
Nice
be
originally
a
colony
from
Marseilles
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
Phocians
(
if
we
may
believe
Justin
and
Polybius
)
settle
in
Gaul
,
and
build
Marseilles
,
during
the
reign
of
Tarquinius
Priscus
at
Rome
.
<EOS>
this
city
flourish
to
such
a
degree
,
that
long
before
the
Romans
be
in
a
condition
to
extend
their
dominion
,
it
send
forth
colony
,
and
establish
them
along
the
coast
of
Liguria
.
<EOS>
of
these
,
Nice
,
or
Nicaea
,
be
one
of
the
most
remarkable
;
so
call
,
in
all
probability
,
from
the
greek
word
Nike
,
signify
Victoria
,
in
consequence
of
some
important
victory
obtain
over
the
Salii
and
Ligures
,
who
be
the
antient
inhabitant
of
this
country
.
<EOS>
nice
,
with
its
mother
city
,
be
in
the
sequel
subdue
by
the
Romans
,
fall
afterwards
successively
under
the
dominion
of
the
Goths
,
Burgundians
,
and
Franks
,
the
king
of
Arles
,
and
the
king
of
Naples
,
as
count
of
Provence
.
<EOS>
in
the
year
one
thousand
three
hundred
and
eighty
-
eight
,
the
city
and
county
of
Nice
be
but
ill
protect
by
the
family
of
Durazzo
,
voluntarily
surrender
themselves
to
Amadaeus
,
surname
the
Red
,
duke
of
Savoy
;
and
since
that
period
,
they
have
continue
as
part
of
that
potentate
's
dominion
,
except
at
such
time
as
they
have
be
over
-
run
and
possess
by
the
power
of
France
,
which
hath
always
be
a
troublesome
neighbour
to
this
country
.
<EOS>
the
castle
be
begin
by
the
arragonian
count
of
Provence
,
and
afterwards
enlarge
by
several
successive
duke
of
Savoy
,
so
as
to
be
deem
impregnable
,
until
the
modern
method
of
besieging
begin
to
take
place
.
<EOS>
a
fruitless
attempt
be
make
upon
it
in
the
year
one
thousand
five
hundred
and
forty
-
three
,
by
the
French
and
Turks
in
conjunction
:
but
it
be
reduce
several
time
after
that
period
,
and
be
now
in
ruin
.
<EOS>
the
celebrated
engineer
Vauban
,
be
command
by
Louis
XIV
to
give
in
a
plan
for
fortify
Nice
,
propose
,
that
the
river
Paglion
should
be
turn
into
a
new
channel
,
so
as
to
surround
the
town
to
the
north
,
and
fall
into
the
harbour
;
that
where
the
Paglion
now
run
to
the
westward
of
the
city
wall
,
there
should
be
a
deep
ditch
to
be
fill
with
sea
-
water
;
and
that
a
fortress
should
be
build
to
the
westward
of
this
fosse
.
<EOS>
these
particular
may
be
execute
at
no
very
great
expence
;
but
,
I
apprehend
,
they
would
be
ineffectual
,
as
the
town
be
command
by
every
hill
in
the
neighbourhood
;
and
the
exhalation
from
stagnate
sea
-
water
would
infallibly
render
the
air
unwholesome
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
undoubted
antiquity
of
Nice
,
very
few
monument
of
that
antiquity
now
remain
.
<EOS>
the
inhabitant
say
,
they
be
either
destroy
by
the
Saracens
in
their
successive
descent
upon
the
coast
,
by
the
barbarous
nation
in
their
repeat
incursion
,
or
use
in
fortify
the
castle
,
as
well
as
in
build
other
edifice
.
<EOS>
the
city
of
Cemenelion
,
however
,
be
subject
to
the
same
disaster
,
and
even
entirely
ruin
,
nevertheless
,
we
still
find
remain
of
its
antient
splendor
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
likewise
a
few
stone
find
at
Nice
,
with
antient
inscription
;
but
there
be
nothing
of
this
kind
standing
,
unless
we
give
the
name
of
antiquity
to
a
marble
cross
on
the
road
to
Provence
,
about
half
a
mile
from
the
city
.
<EOS>
It
stand
upon
a
pretty
high
pedestal
with
step
,
under
a
pretty
stone
cupola
or
dome
,
support
by
four
ionic
pillar
,
on
the
spot
where
Charles
V
emperor
of
Germany
,
Francis
I
*
of
France
,
and
pope
Paul
II
agree
to
have
a
conference
,
in
order
to
determine
all
their
dispute
.
<EOS>
the
emperor
come
hither
by
sea
,
with
a
powerful
fleet
,
and
the
french
king
by
land
,
at
the
head
of
a
numerous
army
.
<EOS>
all
the
endeavour
of
his
holiness
,
however
,
could
not
effect
a
peace
;
but
they
agree
to
a
truce
of
ten
year
.
<EOS>
Mezerai
affirm
,
that
these
two
great
prince
never
see
one
another
on
this
occasion
;
and
that
this
shyness
be
owe
to
the
management
of
the
pope
,
whose
private
design
may
have
be
frustrate
,
<EOS>
have
they
come
to
a
personal
interview
.
<EOS>
in
the
front
of
the
colonade
,
there
be
a
small
stone
,
with
an
inscription
in
Latin
,
which
be
so
high
,
and
so
much
defaced
,
that
I
can
not
read
it
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
sixteenth
century
there
be
a
college
erect
at
Nice
,
by
Emanuel
Philibert
,
duke
of
Savoy
,
for
grant
degree
to
student
of
law
;
and
in
the
year
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
fourteen
,
Charles
Emanuel
<EOS>
I
institute
the
senate
of
Nice
;
consist
of
a
president
,
and
a
certain
number
of
senator
,
who
be
distinguish
by
their
purple
robe
,
and
other
ensign
of
authority
.
<EOS>
They
administer
justice
,
have
the
power
of
life
and
death
,
not
only
through
the
whole
county
of
Nice
,
but
cause
be
evoke
from
Oneglia
,
and
some
other
place
,
to
their
tribunal
,
which
be
the
derni
ressort
,
from
whence
there
be
no
appeal
.
<EOS>
the
commandant
,
however
,
by
virtue
of
his
military
power
and
unrestricted
authority
,
take
upon
him
to
punish
individual
by
imprisonment
,
corporal
pain
,
and
banishment
,
without
consult
the
senate
,
or
indeed
,
observe
any
form
of
trial
.
<EOS>
the
only
redress
against
any
unjust
exercise
of
this
absolute
power
,
be
by
complaint
to
the
king
;
and
you
know
,
what
chance
a
poor
man
have
for
be
redress
in
this
manner
.
  
<EOS>
with
respect
to
religion
,
I
may
safely
say
,
that
here
superstition
reign
under
the
dark
shade
of
ignorance
and
prejudice
.
<EOS>
I
think
there
be
ten
convent
and
three
nunnery
within
and
without
the
wall
of
Nice
;
and
among
them
all
,
I
never
could
hear
of
one
man
who
have
make
any
tolerable
advance
in
any
kind
of
human
learning
.
<EOS>
all
ecclesiastic
be
exempt
from
any
exertion
of
civil
power
,
be
under
the
immediate
protection
and
authority
of
the
bishop
,
or
his
vicar
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
of
Nice
be
suffragan
of
the
archbishop
of
Ambrun
in
France
;
and
the
revenue
of
the
see
amount
to
between
five
and
six
hundred
pound
sterling
.
<EOS>
We
have
likewise
an
office
of
the
inquisition
,
though
I
do
not
hear
that
it
presume
to
execute
any
act
of
jurisdiction
,
without
the
king
's
special
permission
.
<EOS>
all
the
church
be
sanctuary
for
all
kind
of
criminal
,
except
those
guilty
of
high
treason
;
and
the
priest
be
extremely
jealous
of
their
privilege
in
this
particular
.
<EOS>
They
receive
,
with
open
arm
,
murderer
,
robber
,
smuggler
,
fraudulent
bankrupt
,
and
felon
of
every
denomination
;
and
never
give
them
up
,
until
after
have
stipulate
for
their
life
and
liberty
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
enlarge
upon
the
pernicious
consequence
of
this
infamous
prerogative
,
calculate
to
raise
and
extend
the
power
and
influence
of
the
roman
church
,
on
the
ruin
of
morality
and
good
order
.
<EOS>
I
see
a
fellow
,
who
have
three
day
before
murder
his
wife
in
the
last
month
of
pregnancy
,
take
the
air
with
great
composure
and
serenity
,
on
the
step
of
a
church
in
Florence
;
and
nothing
be
more
common
,
than
to
see
the
most
execrable
villain
divert
themselves
in
the
cloyster
of
some
convent
at
Rome
.
  
<EOS>
Nice
abound
with
noblesse
,
marquisse
,
count
,
and
baron
.
<EOS>
of
these
,
three
or
four
family
be
really
respectable
:
the
rest
be
novi
homine
,
spring
from
Bourgeois
,
who
have
save
a
little
money
by
their
different
occupation
,
and
raise
themselves
to
the
rank
of
noblesse
by
purchase
.
<EOS>
one
be
descend
from
an
avocat
;
another
from
an
apothecary
;
a
third
from
a
retailer
of
wine
,
a
fourth
from
a
dealer
in
anchovy
;
and
I
be
tell
,
there
be
actually
a
count
at
Villefranche
,
whose
father
sell
macaroni
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
a
man
in
this
country
may
buy
a
marquisate
,
or
a
county
,
for
the
value
of
three
or
four
hundred
pound
sterling
,
and
the
title
follow
the
fief
;
but
he
may
purchase
lettre
de
noblesse
for
about
thirty
or
forty
guinea
.
<EOS>
in
Savoy
,
there
be
six
hundred
family
of
noblesse
;
the
great
part
of
which
have
not
above
one
hundred
crown
a
year
to
maintain
their
dignity
.
<EOS>
in
the
mountain
of
Piedmont
,
and
even
in
this
country
of
Nice
,
there
be
some
representative
of
very
antient
and
noble
family
,
reduce
to
the
condition
of
common
peasant
;
but
they
still
retain
the
antient
pride
of
their
house
,
and
boast
of
the
noble
blood
that
run
in
their
vein
.
<EOS>
a
gentleman
tell
me
,
that
in
travel
through
the
mountain
,
he
be
oblige
to
pass
a
night
in
the
cottage
of
one
of
these
rusticate
noble
,
who
call
to
his
son
in
the
evening
,
"
Chevalier
,
as
-
tu
donne
a
manger
aux
cochon
?
"
<EOS>
"
have
you
feed
the
Hogs
,
Sir
Knight
?
<EOS>
"
this
,
however
,
be
not
the
case
with
the
noblesse
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
two
or
three
of
them
have
about
four
or
five
hundred
a
year
:
the
rest
,
in
general
,
may
have
about
one
hundred
pistole
,
arise
from
the
silk
,
oil
,
wine
,
and
orange
,
produce
in
their
small
plantation
,
where
they
have
also
country
house
.
<EOS>
some
few
of
these
be
well
build
,
commodious
,
and
situate
;
but
,
for
the
most
part
,
they
be
miserable
enough
.
<EOS>
Our
noblesse
,
notwithstanding
their
origin
,
and
the
cheap
rate
at
which
their
title
have
be
obtain
,
be
nevertheless
extremely
tenacious
of
their
privilege
,
very
delicate
in
maintain
the
etiquette
,
and
keep
at
a
very
stately
distance
from
the
Bourgeoisie
.
<EOS>
how
they
live
in
their
family
,
I
do
not
choose
to
enquire
;
but
,
in
public
,
Madame
appear
in
her
robe
of
gold
,
or
silver
stuff
,
with
her
powder
and
frisure
,
her
perfume
,
her
paint
and
her
patch
;
while
Monsieur
Le
Comte
strut
about
in
his
lace
and
embroidery
.
<EOS>
Rouge
and
fard
be
more
peculiarly
necessary
in
this
country
,
where
the
complexion
and
skin
be
naturally
swarthy
and
yellow
.
<EOS>
I
have
likewise
observe
,
that
most
of
the
female
be
pot
-
belly
;
a
circumstance
owing
,
I
believe
,
to
the
great
quantity
of
vegetable
trash
which
they
eat
.
<EOS>
all
the
horse
,
mule
,
ass
,
and
cattle
,
which
feed
upon
grass
,
have
the
same
distension
.
<EOS>
this
kind
of
food
produce
such
acid
juice
in
the
stomach
,
as
excite
a
perpetual
sense
of
hunger
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
often
amazed
at
the
voracious
appetite
of
these
people
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
expect
that
I
should
describe
the
table
and
the
hospitality
of
our
Nissard
gentry
.
<EOS>
Our
consul
,
who
be
a
very
honest
man
,
tell
me
,
he
have
live
four
and
thirty
year
in
the
country
,
without
have
once
eat
or
drank
in
any
of
their
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
noblesse
of
Nice
can
not
leave
the
country
without
express
leave
from
the
king
;
and
this
leave
,
when
obtain
,
be
for
a
limited
time
,
which
they
dare
not
exceed
,
on
pain
of
incur
his
majesty
's
displeasure
.
<EOS>
They
must
,
therefore
,
endeavour
to
find
amusement
at
home
;
and
this
<EOS>
,
I
apprehend
,
would
be
no
easy
task
for
people
of
an
active
spirit
or
restless
disposition
.
<EOS>
true
it
be
,
the
religion
of
the
country
supply
a
never
-
fail
fund
of
pastime
to
those
who
have
any
relish
for
devotion
;
and
this
be
here
a
prevailing
taste
.
<EOS>
We
have
have
transient
visit
of
a
puppet
-
shew
,
stroll
musician
,
and
rope
-
dancer
;
but
they
do
not
like
their
quarter
,
and
decamp
without
beat
of
drum
.
<EOS>
in
the
summer
,
about
eight
or
nine
at
night
,
part
of
the
noblesse
may
be
see
assemble
in
a
place
call
the
Pare
;
which
be
,
indeed
,
a
sort
of
a
street
form
by
a
row
of
very
paltry
house
on
one
side
,
and
on
the
other
,
by
part
of
the
town
-
wall
,
which
screen
it
from
a
prospect
of
the
sea
,
the
only
object
that
could
render
it
agreeable
.
<EOS>
here
you
may
perceive
the
noblesse
stretch
in
pair
upon
log
of
wood
,
like
so
many
seal
upon
the
rock
by
moon
-
light
,
each
dame
with
her
cicisbeo
:
for
,
you
must
understand
,
this
italian
fashion
prevail
at
Nice
among
all
rank
of
people
;
and
there
be
not
such
a
passion
as
jealousy
know
.
<EOS>
the
husband
and
the
cicisbeo
live
together
as
swear
brother
;
and
the
wife
and
the
mistress
embrace
each
other
with
mark
of
the
warm
affection
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
choose
to
enter
into
particular
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
open
the
scandalous
chronicle
of
Nice
,
without
hazard
of
contamination
.
<EOS>
with
respect
to
delicacy
and
decorum
,
you
may
peruse
dean
Swift
's
description
of
the
Yahoos
,
and
then
you
will
have
some
idea
of
the
porcheria
,
that
distinguish
the
gallantry
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
but
the
Pare
be
not
the
only
place
of
public
resort
for
our
noblesse
in
a
summer
's
evening
.
<EOS>
just
without
one
of
our
gate
,
you
will
find
them
seat
in
ditch
on
the
highway
side
,
serenade
with
the
croaking
of
frog
,
and
the
bell
and
braying
of
mule
and
ass
continually
pass
in
a
perpetual
cloud
of
dust
.
<EOS>
besides
these
amusement
,
there
be
a
public
conversazione
every
evening
at
the
commandant
's
house
call
the
Government
,
where
those
noble
personage
play
at
card
for
farthing
.
<EOS>
in
carnival
time
,
there
be
also
,
at
this
same
government
,
a
ball
twice
or
thrice
a
week
,
carry
on
by
subscription
.
<EOS>
at
this
assembly
every
person
,
without
distinction
,
be
permit
to
dance
in
masquerade
:
but
,
after
dance
,
they
be
oblige
to
unmask
,
and
if
Bourgeois
,
to
retire
.
<EOS>
no
individual
can
give
a
ball
,
without
obtain
a
permission
and
guard
of
the
commandant
;
and
then
his
house
be
open
to
all
masque
,
without
distinction
,
who
be
provide
with
ticket
,
which
ticket
be
sell
by
the
commandant
's
secretary
,
at
five
sol
a
-
piece
,
and
deliver
to
the
guard
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
a
mind
to
entertain
my
particular
friend
,
I
can
not
have
more
than
a
couple
of
violin
;
and
,
in
that
case
,
it
be
call
a
conversazione
.
  
<EOS>
though
the
king
of
Sardinia
take
all
opportunity
to
distinguish
the
subject
of
Great
-
Britain
with
particular
mark
of
respect
,
I
have
see
enough
to
be
convince
,
that
our
nation
be
look
upon
with
an
evil
eye
by
the
people
of
Nice
;
and
this
arise
partly
from
religious
prejudice
,
and
partly
from
envy
,
occasion
by
a
ridiculous
notion
of
our
superior
wealth
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
owe
them
nothing
on
the
score
of
civility
;
and
therefore
,
I
shall
say
nothing
more
on
the
subject
,
lest
I
should
be
tempt
to
deviate
from
that
temperance
and
impartiality
which
I
would
fain
hope
<EOS>
have
hitherto
characterise
the
remark
of

Dear

NICE
,
September

<EOS>
DEAR
DOCTOR
,
 
I
write
in
May
to
Mr
B
  
at
Geneva
,
and
give
him
what
information
he
desire
to
have
,
touch
the
convenience
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
I
shall
now
enter
into
the
same
detail
,
for
the
benefit
of
such
of
your
friend
or
patient
,
as
may
have
occasion
to
try
this
climate
.
  
<EOS>
the
journey
from
Calais
to
Nice
,
of
four
person
in
a
coach
,
or
two
post
-
chaise
,
with
a
servant
on
horseback
,
travel
post
,
may
be
perform
with
ease
,
for
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
pound
,
include
every
expence
.
<EOS>
either
at
Calais
or
at
Paris
,
you
will
always
find
a
travel
coach
or
berline
,
which
you
may
buy
for
thirty
or
forty
guinea
,
and
this
will
serve
very
well
to
reconvey
you
to
your
own
country
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
town
of
Nice
,
you
will
find
no
ready
-
furnished
lodging
for
a
whole
family
.
<EOS>
just
without
one
of
the
gate
,
there
be
two
house
to
be
let
,
ready
-
furnished
,
for
about
five
loui'dore
per
month
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
country
house
in
this
neighbourhood
,
they
be
damp
in
winter
,
and
generally
without
chimnie
;
and
in
summer
they
be
render
uninhabitable
by
the
heat
and
the
vermin
.
<EOS>
if
you
hire
a
tenement
in
Nice
,
you
must
take
it
for
a
year
certain
;
and
this
will
cost
you
about
twenty
pound
sterling
.
<EOS>
for
this
price
,
I
have
a
ground
floor
pave
with
brick
,
consist
of
a
kitchen
,
two
large
hall
,
a
couple
of
good
room
with
chimnie
,
three
large
closet
that
serve
for
bed
-
chamber
,
and
dressing
-
room
,
a
butler
's
room
,
and
three
apartment
for
servant
,
lumber
or
store
,
to
which
we
ascend
by
narrow
wooden
stair
.
<EOS>
I
have
likewise
two
small
garden
,
well
stock
with
orange
,
lemon
,
peach
,
fig
,
grape
,
corinth
,
sallad
,
and
pot
-
herbs
.
<EOS>
It
be
supply
with
a
draw
-
well
of
good
water
,
and
there
be
another
in
the
vestibule
of
the
house
,
which
be
cool
,
large
,
and
magnificent
.
<EOS>
You
may
hire
furniture
for
such
a
tenement
for
about
two
guinea
a
month
:
but
I
choose
rather
to
buy
what
be
necessary
;
and
this
cost
me
about
sixty
pound
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
will
fetch
me
about
half
the
money
when
I
leave
the
place
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
difficult
to
find
a
tolerable
cook
at
Nice
.
<EOS>
a
common
maid
,
who
serve
the
people
of
the
country
,
for
three
or
four
livre
a
month
,
will
not
live
with
an
english
family
under
eight
or
ten
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
slovenly
,
slothful
,
and
unconscionable
cheat
.
<EOS>
the
market
at
Nice
be
tolerably
well
supply
.
<EOS>
Their
beef
,
which
come
from
Piedmont
,
be
pretty
good
,
and
we
have
it
all
the
year
.
<EOS>
in
the
winter
we
have
likewise
excellent
pork
,
and
delicate
lamb
;
but
the
mutton
be
indifferent
.
<EOS>
piedmont
,
also
,
afford
us
delicious
capon
,
feed
with
maize
;
and
this
country
produce
excellent
turkey
,
but
very
few
goose
.
<EOS>
chicken
and
pullet
be
extremely
meagre
.
<EOS>
I
have
try
to
fatten
them
,
without
success
.
<EOS>
in
summer
they
be
subject
to
the
pip
,
and
die
in
great
number
.
<EOS>
autumn
and
winter
be
the
season
for
game
;
hare
,
partridge
,
quail
,
wild
-
pigeon
,
woodcock
,
snipe
,
thrush
,
beccafica
,
and
ortolan
.
<EOS>
wild
-
boar
be
sometimes
find
in
the
mountain
:
it
have
a
delicious
taste
,
not
unlike
that
of
the
wild
hog
in
Jamaica
;
and
would
make
an
excellent
barbecue
,
about
the
beginning
of
winter
,
when
it
be
in
good
case
:
<EOS>
but
,
when
meagre
,
the
head
only
be
present
at
table
.
<EOS>
pheasant
be
very
scarce
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
heath
-
game
,
I
never
see
but
one
cock
,
which
my
servant
buy
in
the
market
,
and
bring
home
;
but
the
commandant
's
cook
come
into
my
kitchen
,
and
carry
it
of
,
after
it
be
half
pluck
,
say
,
his
master
have
company
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
the
hare
be
large
,
plump
,
and
juicy
.
<EOS>
the
partridge
be
generally
of
the
red
sort
;
large
as
pullet
,
and
of
a
good
flavour
:
there
be
also
some
grey
partridge
in
the
mountain
;
and
another
sort
of
a
white
colour
,
that
weigh
four
or
five
pound
each
.
<EOS>
beccafica
be
small
than
sparrow
,
but
very
fat
,
and
they
be
generally
eat
half
raw
.
<EOS>
the
good
way
of
dress
them
be
to
stuff
them
into
a
roll
,
scoop
of
<EOS>
it
be
crum
;
to
baste
them
well
with
butter
,
and
roast
them
,
until
they
be
brown
and
crisp
.
<EOS>
the
ortolan
be
keep
in
cage
,
and
cram
,
until
they
die
of
fat
,
then
eat
as
dainty
.
<EOS>
the
thrush
be
present
with
the
trail
,
because
the
bird
feed
on
olive
.
<EOS>
They
may
as
well
eat
the
trail
of
a
sheep
,
because
it
feed
on
the
aromatic
herb
of
the
mountain
.
<EOS>
in
the
summer
,
we
have
beef
,
veal
,
and
mutton
,
chicken
,
and
duck
;
which
last
be
very
fat
,
and
very
flabby
.
<EOS>
all
the
meat
be
tough
in
this
season
,
because
the
excessive
heat
,
and
great
number
of
fly
,
will
not
admit
of
its
being
keep
any
time
after
it
be
kill
.
<EOS>
butter
and
milk
,
though
not
very
delicate
,
we
have
all
the
year
.
<EOS>
Our
tea
and
fine
sugar
come
from
Marseilles
,
at
a
very
reasonable
price
.
  
<EOS>
Nice
be
not
without
variety
of
fish
;
though
they
be
not
count
so
good
in
their
kind
as
those
of
the
ocean
.
<EOS>
soal
,
and
flat
-
fish
in
general
,
be
scarce
.
<EOS>
here
be
some
mullet
,
both
grey
and
red
.
<EOS>
We
sometimes
see
the
dory
,
which
be
call
St
Pierre
;
with
rock
-
fish
,
bonita
,
and
mackarel
.
<EOS>
the
gurnard
appear
pretty
often
;
and
there
be
plenty
of
a
kind
of
large
whiting
,
which
eat
pretty
well
;
but
have
not
the
delicacy
of
that
which
be
catch
on
our
coast
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
good
fish
of
this
country
,
be
call
Le
Loup
,
about
two
or
three
pound
in
weight
;
white
,
firm
,
and
well
-
flavour
.
<EOS>
another
,
no
-
way
inferior
to
it
,
be
the
Moustel
,
about
the
same
size
;
of
a
dark
-
grey
colour
,
and
short
,
blunt
snout
;
grow
thin
and
flat
from
the
shoulder
downward
,
so
as
to
resemble
a
soal
at
the
tail
.
<EOS>
this
can
not
be
the
mustela
of
the
antient
,
which
be
suppose
to
be
the
sea
lamprey
.
<EOS>
here
too
be
find
the
vyvre
,
or
,
as
we
call
it
,
weaver
;
remarkable
for
its
long
,
sharp
spine
,
so
dangerous
to
the
finger
of
the
fisherman
.
<EOS>
We
have
abundance
of
the
saepia
,
or
cuttle
-
fish
,
of
which
the
people
in
this
country
make
a
delicate
ragout
;
as
also
of
the
polype
de
mer
,
which
be
an
ugly
animal
,
with
long
feeler
,
like
tail
,
which
they
often
wind
about
the
leg
of
the
fisherman
.
<EOS>
They
be
stew
with
onion
,
and
eat
something
like
cow
-
heel
.
<EOS>
the
market
sometimes
afford
the
ecrivisse
de
mer
,
which
be
a
lobster
without
claws
,
of
a
sweetish
taste
;
and
there
be
a
few
rock
oyster
,
very
small
and
very
rank
.
<EOS>
sometimes
the
fisherman
find
under
water
,
piece
of
a
very
hard
cement
,
like
plaister
of
Paris
,
which
contain
a
kind
of
muscle
,
call
la
datte
,
from
its
resemblance
to
a
date
.
<EOS>
these
petrifaction
be
commonly
of
a
triangular
form
and
may
weigh
about
twelve
or
fifteen
pound
each
and
one
of
them
may
contain
a
dozen
of
these
muscle
which
have
nothing
extraordinary
in
the
taste
or
flavour
,
though
extremely
curious
,
as
find
alive
and
juicy
,
in
the
heart
of
a
rock
,
almost
as
hard
as
marble
,
without
any
visible
communication
with
the
air
or
water
.
<EOS>
I
take
it
for
grant
,
however
,
that
the
inclose
cement
be
porous
,
and
admit
the
fine
part
of
the
surround
fluid
.
<EOS>
in
order
to
reach
the
muscle
,
this
cement
must
be
break
with
large
hammer
;
and
it
may
be
truly
say
,
the
kernal
be
not
worth
the
trouble
of
crack
the
shell
.
<EOS>
[
these
be
find
in
great
plenty
at
Ancona
and
other
part
of
the
Adriatic
,
where
they
go
by
the
name
of
Bollani
,
as
we
be
inform
by
Keysler
.
]
<EOS>
among
the
fish
of
this
country
,
there
be
a
very
ugly
animal
of
the
eel
specie
,
which
may
pass
for
a
serpent
:
it
be
of
a
dusky
,
black
colour
,
mark
with
spot
of
yellow
,
about
eighteen
inch
,
or
two
foot
long
.
<EOS>
the
Italians
call
it
murena
;
but
whether
it
be
the
fish
which
have
the
same
name
among
the
antient
Romans
,
I
can
not
pretend
to
determine
.
<EOS>
the
antient
murena
be
count
a
great
delicacy
,
and
be
keep
in
pond
for
extraordinary
occasion
.
<EOS>
Julius
Caesar
borrow
six
thousand
for
one
entertainment
:
but
I
imagine
this
be
the
river
lamprey
.
<EOS>
the
murena
of
this
country
be
in
no
esteem
,
and
only
eat
by
the
poor
people
.
  
<EOS>
Craw
-
fish
and
trout
be
rarely
find
in
the
river
among
the
mountain
.
<EOS>
the
sword
-
fish
be
much
esteem
in
Nice
,
and
call
l'empereur
,
about
six
or
seven
foot
long
:
but
I
have
never
see
it
.
<EOS>
[
since
I
write
the
above
letter
,
I
have
eat
several
time
of
this
fish
,
which
be
as
white
as
the
fine
veal
,
and
extremely
delicate
.
<EOS>
the
emperor
associate
with
the
tunny
fish
,
and
be
always
take
in
their
company
.
]
<EOS>
They
be
very
scarce
;
and
when
take
,
be
generally
conceal
,
because
the
head
belong
to
the
commandant
,
who
have
likewise
the
privilege
of
buy
the
good
fish
at
a
very
low
price
.
<EOS>
for
which
reason
,
the
choice
piece
be
conceal
by
the
fisherman
,
and
send
privately
to
Piedmont
or
Genoa
.
<EOS>
but
,
the
chief
fishery
on
this
coast
be
of
the
sardine
,
anchovy
,
and
tunny
.
<EOS>
these
be
take
in
small
quantity
all
the
year
;
but
spring
and
summer
be
the
season
when
they
mostly
abound
.
<EOS>
in
June
and
July
,
a
fleet
of
about
fifty
fishing
-
boat
put
to
sea
every
evening
about
eight
o'clock
,
and
catch
anchovy
in
immense
quantity
.
<EOS>
one
small
boat
sometimes
take
in
one
night
twenty
-
five
rup
,
amount
to
six
hundred
weight
;
but
it
must
be
observe
,
that
the
pound
here
,
as
well
as
in
other
part
of
Italy
,
consist
but
of
twelve
ounce
.
<EOS>
anchovy
,
besides
their
make
a
considerable
article
in
the
commerce
of
Nice
,
be
a
great
resource
in
all
family
.
<EOS>
the
noblesse
and
burgeois
sup
on
sallad
and
anchovy
,
which
be
eat
on
all
their
meagre
day
.
<EOS>
the
fisherman
and
mariner
all
along
this
coast
have
scarce
any
other
food
but
dry
bread
,
with
a
few
pickle
anchovy
;
and
when
the
fish
be
eat
,
they
rub
their
crust
with
the
brine
.
<EOS>
nothing
can
be
more
delicious
than
fresh
anchovy
fry
in
oil
:
I
prefer
them
to
the
smelt
of
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
mention
,
that
the
sardine
and
anchovy
be
catch
in
net
;
salt
,
barrel
,
and
export
into
all
the
different
kingdom
and
state
of
Europe
.
<EOS>
the
sardine
,
however
,
be
large
and
fat
in
the
month
of
September
.
<EOS>
a
company
of
adventurer
have
farm
the
tunny
-
fishery
of
the
king
,
for
six
year
;
a
monopoly
,
for
which
they
pay
about
three
thousand
pound
sterling
.
<EOS>
They
be
at
a
very
considerable
expence
for
net
,
boat
,
and
attendance
.
<EOS>
Their
net
be
dispose
in
a
very
curious
manner
across
the
small
bay
of
St
Hospice
,
in
this
neighbourhood
,
where
the
fish
chiefly
resort
.
<EOS>
They
be
never
remove
,
except
in
the
winter
,
and
when
they
want
repair
:
but
there
be
avenue
for
the
fish
to
enter
,
and
pass
,
from
one
inclosure
to
another
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
man
in
a
boat
,
who
constantly
keep
watch
.
<EOS>
when
he
perceive
they
be
fairly
enter
,
he
have
a
method
for
shut
all
the
pass
,
and
confine
the
fish
to
one
apartment
of
the
net
,
which
be
lift
up
into
the
boat
,
until
the
prisoner
be
take
and
secure
.
<EOS>
the
tunny
-
fish
generally
run
from
fifty
to
one
hundred
weight
;
but
some
of
them
be
much
large
.
<EOS>
They
be
immediately
gutte
,
boil
,
and
cut
in
slice
.
<EOS>
the
gut
and
head
afford
oil
:
the
slice
be
partly
dry
,
to
be
eat
occasionally
with
oil
and
vinegar
,
or
barrel
up
in
oil
,
to
be
export
.
<EOS>
It
be
count
a
delicacy
in
Italy
and
Piedmont
,
and
taste
not
unlike
sturgeon
.
<EOS>
the
famous
pickle
of
the
ancient

call
garum
,
be
make
of
the
gill
and
blood
of
the
tunny
,
or
thynnus
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
much
more
considerable
fishery
of
it
in
Sardinia
,
where
it
be
say
to
employ
four
hundred
person
;
but
this
belong
to
the
duc
de
St

<EOS>
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Villa
Franca
,
there
be
people
always
employ
in
fishing
for
coral
and
sponge
,
which
grow
adhere
to
the
rock
under
water
.
<EOS>
Their
method
do
not
favour
much
of
ingenuity
.
<EOS>
for
the
coral

they
lower
down
a
swab

compose
of
what
be
call
spunyarn
on

our

of

hang
in

strike

disengage
it
from

I

<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
before
I
tell
you
the
price
of
provision
at
Nice
,
it
will
be
necessary
to
say
something
of
the
money
.
<EOS>
the
gold
coin
of
Sardinia
consist
of
the
doppia
di
savoia
,
value
twenty
-
four
livre
Piedmontese
,
about
the
size
of
a
loui'dore
;
and
the
mezzo
doppia
,
or
piece
of
twelve
livre
.
<EOS>
in
silver
,
there
be
the
scudo
of
six
livre
,
the
mezzo
scudo
of
three
;
and
the
quarto
,
or
pezza
di
trenta
soldi
:
but
all
these
be
very
scarce
.
<EOS>
We
seldom
see
any
gold
and
silver
coin
,
but
the
loui'dore
,
and
the
six
,
and
three
-
livre
piece
of
France
;
a
sure
sign
that
the
French
suffer
by
their
contraband
commerce
with
the
Nissards
.
<EOS>
the
coin
chiefly
use
at
market
be
a
piece
of
copper
silver
,
that
pass
for
seven
sol
and
a
half
;
another
of
the
same
sort
,
value
two
sol
and
a
half
.
<EOS>
They
have
on
one
side
the
impression
of
the
king
's
head
;
and
on
the
other
,
the
arm
of
Savoy
,
with
a
ducal
crown
,
inscribe
with
his
name
and
title
.
<EOS>
there
be
of
genuine
copper
,
piece
of
one
sol
,
stamp
on
one
side
with
a
cross
fleuree
;
and
on
the
reverse
,
with
the
king
's
cypher
and
crown
,
inscribe
as
the
other
:
finally
,
there
be
another
small
copper
piece
,
call
piccalon
,
the
sixth
part
of
a
sol
,
with
a
plain
cross
,
and
on
the
reverse
,
a
slip
-
knot
surmount
with
a
crown
;
the
legend
as
above
.
<EOS>
the
impression
and
legend
on
the
gold
and
silver
coin
,
be
the
same
as
those
on
the
piece
of
seven
sol
and
a
half
.
<EOS>
the
livre
of
Piedmont
consist
of
twenty
sol
,
and
be
very
near
of
the
same
value
as
an
English
shilling
:
<EOS>
ten
sol
,
therefore
,
be
equal
to
six
-
pence
sterling
.
<EOS>
Butcher
's
meat
in
general
sell
at
Nice
for
three
sol
a
pound
;
and
veal
be
something
dearer
:
<EOS>
but
then
there
be
but
twelve
ounce
in
the
pound
,
which
be
allow
for
,
sixteen
ounce
<EOS>
,
come
for
something
less
than
twopence
halfpenny
English
.
<EOS>
fish
commonly
sell
for
four
sol
the
twelve
ounce
,
or
five
for
the
english
pound
;
and
these
five
be
equivalent
to
three
-
penny
of
our
money
:
but
sometimes
we
be
oblige
to
pay
five
,
and
even
six
sol
for
the
piedmontese
pound
of
fish
.
<EOS>
a
turkey
that
would
sell
for
five
or
six
shilling
at
the
London
market
,
cost
me
but
three
at
Nice
.
<EOS>
I
can
buy
a
good
capon
for
thirty
sol
,
or
eighteen
-
penny
;
and
the
same
price
I
pay
for
a
brace
of
partridge
,
or
a
good
hare
.
<EOS>
I
can
have
a
woodcock
for
twenty
-
four
sol
;
but
the
pigeon
be
dearer
than
in
London
.
<EOS>
rabbit
be
very
rare
;
and
there
be
scarce
a
goose
to
be
see
in
the
whole
county
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
Wild
-
duck
and
teal
be
sometimes
to
be
have
in
the
winter
;
and
now
I
be
speak
of
sea
-
fowl
,
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
tell
you
what
I
know
of
the
halcyon
,
or
king's
-
fisher
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
bird
,
though
very
rare
in
this
country
about
the
size
of
a
pigeon
;
the
body
brown
,
and
the
belly
white
:
<EOS>
by
a
wonderful
instinct
it
make
its
nest
upon
the
surface
of
the
sea
,
and
lay
its
egg
in
the
month
of
November
,
when
the
Mediterranean
be
always
calm
and
smooth
as
a
mill
-
pond
.
<EOS>
the
people
about
here
call
them
martinet
,
because
they
begin
to
hatch
about
Martinmass
.
<EOS>
Their
nest
be
sometimes
see
float
near
the
shore
,
and
generally
become
the
prize
of
the
boy
,
who
be
very
alert
in
catch
them
.
  
<EOS>
You
know
all
sea
-
bird
be
allow
by
the
church
of
Rome
to
be
eat
on
meagre
day
,
as
a
kind
of
fish
;
and
the
monk
especially
do
not
fail
to
make
use
of
this
permission
.
<EOS>
Sea
turtle
,
or
tortoise
,
be
often
find
at
sea
by
the
mariner
,
in
these
latitude
:
but
they
be
not
the
green
sort
,
so
much
in
request
among
the
alderman
of
London
.
<EOS>
all
the
Mediterranean
turtle
be
of
the
kind
call
loggerhead
,
which
in
the
West
-
Indies
be
eat
by
none
but
hungry
seaman
,
negroes
,
and
the
low
class
of
people
.
<EOS>
one
of
these
,
weigh
about
two
hundred
pound
,
be
lately
bring
on
shore
by
the
fisherman
of
Nice
,
who
find
it
float
asleep
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
.
<EOS>
the
whole
town
be
alarm
at
sight
of
such
a
monster
,
the
nature
of
which
they
could
not
comprehend
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
monk
,
call
minim
,
of
St
Francesco
di
Paolo
,
guide
by
a
sure
instinct
,
mark
it
as
their
prey
,
and
surround
it
accordingly
.
<EOS>
the
friar
of
other
convent
,
not
quite
so
hungry
,
crowd
down
to
the
beach
,
declare
it
should
not
be
eat
;
drop
some
hint
about
the
possibility
of
its
be
something
praeternatural
and
diabolical
,
and
even
propose
exorcism
and
aspersion
with
holy
water
.
<EOS>
the
populace
be
divide
accord
to
their
attachment
to
this
,
or
that
convent
:
a
mighty
clamour
arise
;
and
the
police
,
in
order
to
remove
the
cause
of
their
contention
,
order
the
tortoise
to
be
recommit
to
the
wave
;
a
sentence
which
the
Franciscans
see
execute
,
not
without
sigh
and
lamentation
.
<EOS>
the
land
-
turtle
,
or
terrapin
,
be
much
better
know
at
Nice
,
as
be
a
native
of
this
country
;
yet
the
good
be
bring
from
the
island
of
Sardinia
.
<EOS>
the
soup
or
bouillon
of
this
animal
be
always
prescribe
here
as
a
great
restorative
to
consumptive
patient
.
<EOS>
the
bread
of
Nice
be
very
indifferent
,
and
I
be
persuade
very
unwholesome
.
<EOS>
the
flour
be
generally
musty
,
and
not
quite
free
of
sand
.
<EOS>
this
be
either
owe
to
the
particle
of
the
mill
-
stone
rub
off
in
grinding
,
or
to
what
adhere
to
the
corn
itself
,
in
be
thresh
upon
the
common
ground
;
for
there
be
no
threshing
-
floor
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
I
shall
now
take
notice
of
the
vegetable
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
in
the
winter
,
we
have
green
pease
,
asparagus
,
artichoak
,
cauliflower
,
bean
,
french
bean
,
celery
,
and
endive
;
cabbage
,
colewort
,
radish
,
turnip
,
carrot
,
betterave
,
sorrel
lettuce
,
onion
,
garlic
,
and
chalot
.
<EOS>
We
have
potato
from
the
mountain
,
mushroom
,
champignon
,
and
truffle
.
<EOS>
piedmont
afford
white
truffle
,
count
the
most
delicious
in
the
world
:
they
sell
for
about
three
livre
the
pound
.
<EOS>
the
fruit
of
this
season
be
pickle
olive
,
orange
,
lemon
,
citron
,
citronelle
,
dry
fig
,
grape
,
apple
,
pear
,
almond
,
chestnut
,
walnut
,
filbert
,
medlar
,
pomegranate
,
and
a
fruit
call
azerolle
,
[
the
Italians
call
them
Lazerruoli
.
]
<EOS>
about
the
size
of
a
nutmeg
,
of
an
oblong
shape
,
red
colour
,
and
agreeable
acid
taste
.
<EOS>
I
may
likewise
add
the
cherry
of
the
Laurus
cerasus
,
which
be
sell
in
the
market
;
very
beautiful
to
the
eye
,
but
insipid
to
the
palate
.
<EOS>
in
summer
we
have
all
those
vegetable
in
perfection
.
<EOS>
there
be
also
a
kind
of
small
courge
,
or
gourd
,
of
which
the
people
of
the
country
make
a
very
savoury
ragout
,
with
the
help
of
egg
,
cheese
,
and
fresh
anchovy
.
<EOS>
another
be
make
of
the
badenjean
,
which
the
Spaniards
call
berengena
:
[
this
fruit
be
call
Melanzana
in
Italy
and
be
much
esteem
by
the
Jews
in
Leghorn
.
<EOS>
perhaps
Melanzana
be
a
corruption
of
Malamsana
.
]
<EOS>
it
be
much
eat
in
Spain
and
the
Levant
,
as
well
as
by
the
Moors
in
Barbary
.
<EOS>
It
be
about
the
size
and
shape
of
a
hen
's
egg
,
inclose
in
a
cup
like
an
acorn
;
when
ripe
,
of
a
faint
purple
colour
.
<EOS>
It
grow
on
a
stalk
about
a
foot
high
,
with
long
spine
or
prickle
.
<EOS>
the
people
here
have
different
way
of
slicing
and
dress
it
,
by
broil
,
boil
,
and
stewing
,
with
other
ingredient
:
but
it
be
at
best
an
insipid
dish
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
caperbushe
in
this
neighbourhood
,
which
grow
wild
in
hole
of
garden
wall
,
and
require
no
sort
of
cultivation
:
in
one
or
two
garden
,
there
be
palm
-
tree
;
but
the
date
never
ripen
.
<EOS>
in
my
register
of
the
weather
,
I
have
mark
the
season
of
the
principal
fruit
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
in
May
we
have
strawberry
,
which
continue
in
season
two
or
three
month
.
<EOS>
these
be
of
the
wood
kind
;
very
grateful
,
and
of
a
good
flavour
;
but
the
scarlet
and
hautboy
be
not
know
at
Nice
.
<EOS>
in
the
beginning
of
June
,
and
even
sooner
,
the
cherry
begin
to
be
ripe
.
<EOS>
They
be
a
kind
of
bleed
heart
;
large
,
fleshy
,
and
high
flavour
,
though
rather
too
luscious
.
<EOS>
I
have
likewise
see
a
few
of
those
we
call
kentish
cherry
which
be
much
more
cool
,
acid
,
and
agreeable
,
especially
in
this
hot
climate
.
<EOS>
the
cherry
be
succeed
by
the
apricot
and
peach
,
which
be
all
standard
,
and
of
consequence
better
flavour
than
what
we
call
wall
-
fruit
.
<EOS>
the
tree
,
as
well
as
almond
,
grow
and
bear
without
care
and
cultivation
,
and
may
be
see
in
the
open
field
about
Nice
,
but
without
proper
culture
,
the
fruit
degenerate
.
<EOS>
the
good
peach
I
have
see
at
Nice
be
the
amberge
,
of
a
yellow
hue
,
and
oblong
shape
,
about
the
size
of
a
small
lemon
.
<EOS>
Their
consistence
be
much
more
solid
than
that
of
our
english
peach
,
and
their
taste
more
delicious
.
<EOS>
several
tree
of
this
kind
I
have
in
my
own
garden
.
<EOS>
here
be
likewise
plenty
of
other
sort
;
but
no
nectarine
.
<EOS>
We
have
little
choice
of
plumb
.
<EOS>
neither
do
I
admire
the
pear
or
apple
of
this
country
:
but
the
most
agreeable
apple
I
ever
taste
,
come
from
Final
,
and
be
call
pomi
carli
.
<EOS>
the
great
fault
I
find
with
most
fruit
in
this
climate
,
be
,
that
they
be
too
sweet
and
luscious
,
and
want
that
agreeable
acid
which
be
so
cool
and
so
grateful
in
a
hot
country
.
<EOS>
this
,
too
,
be
the
case
with
our
grape
,
of
which
there
be
great
plenty
and
variety
,
plump
and
juicy
,
and
large
as
plumb
.
<EOS>
nature
,
however
,
have
not
neglect
to
provide
other
agreeable
vegetable
juice
to
cool
the
human
body
.
<EOS>
during
the
whole
summer
,
we
have
plenty
of
musk
melon
.
<EOS>
I
can
buy
one
as
large
as
my
head
for
the
value
of
an
english
penny
:
but
one
of
the
good
and
large
,
weigh
ten
or
twelve
pound
,
I
can
have
for
twelve
sol
,
or
about
eight
-
pence
sterling
.
<EOS>
from
Antibes
and
Sardinia
,
we
have
another
fruit
call
a
watermelon
,
which
be
well
know
in
Jamaica
,
and
some
of
our
other
colony
.
<EOS>
those
from
Antibes
be
about
the
size
of
an
ordinary
bomb
-
shell
:
but
the
Sardinian
and
Jamaica
watermelon
be
four
time
as
large
.
<EOS>
the
skin
be
green
,
smooth
,
and
thin
.
<EOS>
the
inside
be
a
purple
pulp
,
stud
with
broad
,
flat
,
black
seed
,
and
impregnate
with
a
juice
the
most
cool
,
delicate
,
and
refreshing
,
that
can
well
be
conceive
.
<EOS>
one
would
imagine
the
pulp
itself
dissolve
in
the
stomach
;
for
you
may
eat
of
it
until
you
be
fill
up
to
the
tongue
,
without
feel
the
least
inconvenience
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
friendly
to
the
constitution
,
that
in
ardent
inflammatory
fever
,
it
be
drink
as
the
good
emulsion
.
<EOS>
at
Genoa
,
Florence
,
and
Rome
,
it
be
sell
in
the
street
,
ready
cut
in
slice
;
and
the
porter
,
sweat
under
their
burthen
,
buy
,
and
eat
them
as
they
pass
.
<EOS>
a
porter
of
London
quench
his
thirst
with
a
draught
of
strong
beer
:
a
porter
of
Rome
,
or
Naples
,
refresh
himself
with
a
slice
of
water
-
melon
,
or
a
glass
of
ice
-
water
.
<EOS>
the
one
cost
three
half
-
pence
;
the
last
,
half
a
farthing
 
which
of
them
be
most
effectual
?
<EOS>
I
be
sure
the
man
be
equally
pleased
.
<EOS>
It
be
commonly
remark
,
that
beer
strengthen
as
well
as
refreshe
.
<EOS>
but
the
porter
of
Constantinople
,
who
never
drink
any
thing
strong
than
water
,
and
eat
very
little
animal
food
,
will
lift
and
carry
heavy
burthen
than
any
other
porter
in
the
known
world
.
<EOS>
if
we
may
believe
the
most
respectable
traveller
,
a
Turk
will
carry
a
load
of
seven
hundred
weight
,
which
be
more
(
I
believe
)
than
any
english
porter
ever
attempt
to
carry
any
length
of
way
.
  
<EOS>
among
the
refreshment
of
these
warm
country
,
I
ought
not
to
forget
mention
the
sorbettes
,
which
be
sell
in
coffee
-
house
,
and
place
of
public
resort
.
<EOS>
They
be
ice
froth
,
make
with
juice
of
orange
,
apricot
,
or
peach
;
very
agreeable
to
the
palate
,
and
so
extremely
cold
,
that
I
be
afraid
to
swallow
them
in
this
hot
country
,
until
I
find
from
information
and
experience
,
that
they
may
be
take
in
moderation
,
without
any
bad
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
another
considerable
article
in
house
-
keeping
be
wine
,
which
we
have
here
good
and
reasonable
.
<EOS>
the
wine
of
Tavelle
in
Languedoc
be
very
near
as
good
as
Burgundy
,
and
may
be
have
at
Nice
,
at
the
rate
of
six
-
pence
a
bottle
.
<EOS>
the
sweet
wine
of
St
Laurent
,
count
equal
to
that
of
Frontignan
,
cost
about
eight
or
nine
-
pence
a
quart
:
pretty
good
Malaga
may
be
have
for
half
the
money
.
<EOS>
those
who
make
their
own
wine
choose
the
grape
from
different
vineyard
,
and
have
them
pick
,
press
,
and
ferment
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
that
which
be
make
by
the
peasant
,
both
red
and
white
,
be
generally
genuine
:
but
the
wine
-
merchant
of
Nice
brew
and
balderdash
,
and
even
mix
it
with
pigeon
dung
and
quick
-
lime
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
suppose
,
that
a
stranger
and
sojourner
should
buy
his
own
grape
,
and
make
his
own
provision
of
wine
:
but
he
may
buy
it
by
recommendation
from
the
peasant
,
for
about
eighteen
or
twenty
livre
<EOS>
the
charge
,
consist
of
eleven
rup
five
pound
;
in
other
word
,
of
two
hundred
and
eighty
pound
of
this
country
,
so
as
to
bring
it
for
something
less
than
three
-
pence
a
quart
.
<EOS>
the
nice
wine
,
when
mix
with
water
,
make
an
agreeable
beverage
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
inferior
sort
for
servant
drink
by
the
common
people
,
which
in
the
cabaret
do
not
cost
above
a
penny
a
bottle
.
<EOS>
the
people
here
be
not
so
nice
as
the
English
,
in
the
management
of
their
wine
.
<EOS>
It
be
keep
in
flacon
,
or
large
flask
,
without
cork
,
have
a
little
oil
at
top
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
deem
the
bad
for
have
be
open
a
day
or
two
before
;
and
they
expose
it
to
the
hot
sun
,
and
all
kind
of
weather
,
without
hesitation
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
this
treatment
have
little
or
no
effect
upon
its
taste
,
flavour
,
and
transparency
.
  
<EOS>
the
brandy
of
Nice
be
very
indifferent
:
and
the
liqueur
be
so
sweetened
with
coarse
sugar
,
that
they
scarce
retain
the
taste
or
flavour
of
any
other
ingredient
.
  
<EOS>
the
last
article
of
domestic
oeconomy
which
I
shall
mention
be
fuel
,
or
wood
for
firing
,
which
I
buy
for
eleven
sol
(
a
little
more
than
six
-
pence
halfpenny
)
<EOS>
a
quintal
,
consist
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
pound
nice
weight
.
<EOS>
the
good
,
which
be
of
oak
,
come
from
Sardinia
.
<EOS>
the
common
sort
be
olive
,
which
be
cut
with
the
sap
in
it
,
ought
to
be
lay
in
during
the
summer
;
otherwise
,
it
will
make
a
very
uncomfortable
fire
.
<EOS>
in
my
kitchen
and
two
chamber
,
I
burn
fifteen
thousand
weight
of
wood
in
four
week
,
exclusive
of
charcoal
for
the
kitchen
stove
,
and
of
pine
-
top
for
light
the
fire
.
<EOS>
these
last
be
as
large
as
pineapple
,
which
they
greatly
resemble
in
shape
,
and
to
which
,
indeed
,
they
give
their
name
;
and
be
full
of
turpentine
,
make
a
wonderful
blaze
.
<EOS>
for
the
same
purpose
,
the
people
of
these
country
use
the
sarment
,
or
cutting
of
the
vine
,
which
they
sell
make
up
in
small
fascine
.
<EOS>
this
great
consumption
of
wood
be
owe
to
the
large
fire
use
in
roast
piece
of
beef
,
and
joint
,
in
the
english
manner
.
<EOS>
the
roast
of
this
country
seldom
exceed
two
or
three
pound
of
meat
;
and
their
other
plat
be
make
over
stove
hole
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
now
high
time
to
conduct
you
from
the
kitchen
,
where
you
have
be
too
long
detain
by
 
Your
humble
servant
.
  
<EOS>
PS
 
<EOS>
I
have
mention
the
price
of
almost
all
the
article
in
house
-
keeping
,
as
they
be
pay
by
the
English
:
but
exclusive
of
butcher
's
meat
,
I
be
certain
the
native
do
not
pay
so
much
by
thirty
per
cent
.
<EOS>
Their
imposition
on
us
,
be
not
only
a
proof
of
their
own
villany
and
hatred
,
but
a
scandal
on
their
government
;
which
ought
to
interfere
in
favour
of
the
subject
of
a
nation
,
to
which
they
be
so
much
bind
in
point
of
policy
,
as
well
as
gratitude

<EOS>
SIR
,
 
as
I
have
nothing
else
to
do
,
but
to
satisfy
my
own
curiosity
,
and
that
of
my
friend
,
I
obey
your
injunction
with
pleasure
;
though
not
without
some
apprehension
that
my
inquiry
will
afford
you
very
little
entertainment
.
<EOS>
the
place
where
I
be
be
of
very
little
importance
or
consequence
as
a
state
or
community
;
neither
be
there
any
thing
curious
or
interesting
in
the
character
or
oeconomy
of
its
inhabitant
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
some
few
merchant
in
Nice
,
say
to
be
in
good
circumstance
.
<EOS>
I
know
one
of
them
,
who
deal
to
a
considerable
extent
,
and
go
twice
a
year
to
London
to
attend
the
sale
of
the
East
-
India
company
.
<EOS>
He
buy
up
a
very
large
quantity
of
muslin
,
and
other
indian
good
,
and
freight
a
ship
in
the
river
to
transport
them
to
Villa
Franca
.
<EOS>
some
of
these
be
send
to
Swisserland
;
but
,
I
believe
,
the
great
part
be
smuggle
into
France
,
by
virtue
of
counterfeit
stamp
,
which
be
here
use
without
any
ceremony
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
chief
commerce
of
this
place
be
a
contraband
traffick
carry
on
to
the
disadvantage
of
France
;
and
I
be
tell
,
that
the
farmer
of
the
levant
company
in
that
kingdom
find
their
account
in
connive
at
it
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
a
great
quantity
of
merchandize
be
bring
hither
every
week
by
mule
from
Turin
and
other
part
in
Piedmont
,
and
afterwards
convey
to
the
other
side
of
the
Var
,
either
by
land
or
water
.

be
exceed
strong
and
hardy
.
<EOS>
one
of
them
will
carry
a
burthen
of
near
six
hundred
weight
.
<EOS>
They
be
easily
nourish
,
and
require
no
other
respite
from
their
labour
,
but
the
night
's
repose
.
<EOS>
They
be
the
only
carriage
that
can
be
use
in
cross
the
mountain
,
be
very
sure
-
footed
:
and
it
be
observe
that
in
choose
their
step
,
they
always
march
upon
the
brink
of
the
precipice
.
<EOS>
You
must
let
them
take
their
own
way
,
otherwise
you
will
be
in
danger
of
lose
your
life
;
for
they
be
obstinate
,
even
to
desperation
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
dangerous
for
a
person
on
horseback
to
meet
those
animal
:
they
have
such
an
aversion
to
horse
,
that
they
will
attack
them
with
incredible
fury
,
so
as
even
to
tear
them
and
their
rider
in
piece
;
and
the
good
method
for
avoid
this
fate
,
be
to
clap
spur
to
your
beast
,
and
seek
your
safety
in
flight
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
more
than
once
oblige
to
fly
before
them
.
<EOS>
They
always
give
you
warn
,
by
raise
a
hideous
braying
as
soon
as
they
perceive
the
horse
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
the
mule
of
Provence
be
not
so
mischievous
,
because
they
be
more
used
to
the
sight
and
society
of
horse
:
but
those
of
Piedmont
be
by
far
the
large
and
the
strong
I
have
see
.
  
<EOS>
some
very
feasible
scheme
for
improve
the
commerce
of
Nice
have
be
present
to
the
ministry
of
Turin
;
but
hitherto
without
success
.
<EOS>
the
english
import
annually
between
two
and
three
thousand
bale
of
raw
silk
,
the
growth
of
Piedmont
;
and
this
declaration
would
be
hold
legal
evidence
.
<EOS>
in
some
part
of
France
,
the
cure
of
the
parish
,
on
all
Souls
'
day
,
which
be
call
le
jour
des
morts
,
say
a
libera
domine
for
two
sol
,
at
every
grave
in
the
burying
-
ground
,
for
the
release
of
the
soul
whose
body
be
there
interred
.
  
<EOS>
the
artisan
of
Nice
be
very
lazy
,
very
needy
,
very
aukward
,
and
void
of
all
ingenuity
.
<EOS>
the
price
of
their
labour
be
very
near
as
high
as
at
London
or
Paris
.
<EOS>
rather
than
work
for
moderate
profit
,
arise
from
constant
employment
,
which
would
comfortably
maintain
them
and
their
family
,
they
choose
to
starve
at
home
,
to
lounge
about
the
rampart
,
bask
themselves
in
the
sun
,
or
play
at
bowl
in
the
street
from
morning
 
'
till
night
.
  
<EOS>
the
low
class
of
people
consist
of
fisherman
,
day
labourer
,
porter
,
and
peasant
:
these
last
be
distribute
chiefly
in
the
small
cassine
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
city
,
and
be
say
to
amount
to
twelve
thousand
.
<EOS>
They
be
employ
in
labour
the
ground
,
and
have
all
the
outward
sign
of
extreme
misery
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
diminutive
,
meagre
,
withered
,
dirty
,
and
half
naked
;
in
their
complexion
,
not
barely
swarthy
,
but
as
black
as
moor
;
and
I
believe
many
of
them
be
descendant
of
that
people
.
<EOS>
They
be
very
hard
favour
;
and
their
woman
in
general
have
the
coarse
feature
<EOS>
I
have
ever
see
:
it
must
be
own
,
however
,
they
have
the
fine
tooth
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
the
nourishment
of
those
poor
creature
consist
of
the
refuse
of
the
garden
,
very
coarse
bread
,
a
kind
of
meal
call
polenta
,
make
of
indian
corn
,
which
be
very
nourishing
and
agreeable
,
and
a
little
oil
;
but
even
in
these
particular
,
they
seem
to
be
stint
to
very
scanty
meal
.
<EOS>
I
have
know
a
peasant
feed
his
family
with
the
skin
of
boil
bean
.
<EOS>
Their
hog
be
much
better
feed
than
their
child
.
'
<EOS>
tis
pity
they
have
no
cow
,
which
would
yield
milk
,
butter
,
and
cheese
,
for
the
sustenance
of
their
family
.
<EOS>
with
all
this
wretchedness
,
one
of
these
peasant
will
not
work
in
your
garden
for
less
than
eighteen
sol
,
about
eleven
pence
sterling
,
per
diem
;
and
then
he
do
not
half
the
work
of
an
english
labourer
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
fruit
in
it
,
or
any
thing
he
can
convey
,
he
will
infallibly
steal
it
,
if
you
do
not
keep
a
very
watchful
eye
over
him
.
<EOS>
all
the
common
people
be
thief
and
beggar
;
and
I
believe
this
be
always
the
case
with
people
who
be
extremely
indigent
and
miserable
.
<EOS>
in
other
respect
,
they
be
seldom
guilty
of
excess
.
<EOS>
They
be
remarkably
respectful
and
submissive
to
their
superior
.
<EOS>
the
populace
of
Nice
be
very
quiet
and
orderly
.
<EOS>
They
be
little
addict
to
drunkenness
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
hear
of
one
riot
since
I
live
among
them
;
and
murder
and
robbery
be
altogether
unknown
.
<EOS>
a
man
may
walk
alone
over
the
county
of
Nice
,
at
midnight
,
without
danger
of
insult
.
<EOS>
the
police
be
very
well
regulated
.
<EOS>
no
man
be
permit
to
wear
a
pistol
or
dagger
on
pain
of
be
send
to
the
gallie
.
<EOS>
I
be
inform
,
that
both
murder
and
robbery
be
very
frequent
in
some
part
of
Piedmont
.
<EOS>
even
here
,
when
the
peasant
quarrel
in
their
cup
,
(
which
very
seldom
happen
)
they
draw
their
knife
,
and
the
one
infallibly
stab
the
other
.
<EOS>
to
such
extremity
,
however
,
they
never
proceed
,
except
when
there
be
a
woman
in
the
case
;
and
mutual
jealousy
co
-
operate
with
the
liquor
they
have
drink
,
to
inflame
their
passion
.
<EOS>
in
Nice
,
the
common
people
retire
to
their
lodging
at
eight
o'clock
in
winter
,
and
nine
in
summer
.
<EOS>
every
person
find
in
the
street
after
these
hour
,
be
apprehend
by
the
patrole
;
and
,
if
he
can
not
give
a
good
account
of
himself
,
send
to
prison
.
<EOS>
at
nine
in
winter
,
and
ten
in
summer
,
there
be
a
curfew
-
bell
rung
,
warn
the
people
to
put
out
their
light
,
and
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
very
necessary
precaution
in
town
subject
to
conflagration
;
but
of
small
use
in
Nice
,
where
there
be
very
little
combustible
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
punishment
inflict
upon
malefactor
and
delinquent
at
Nice
be
hang
for
capital
crime
;
slavery
on
board
the
gallie
for
a
limited
term
,
or
for
life
,
accord
to
the
nature
of
the
transgression
;
flagellation
,
and
the
strappado
.
<EOS>
this
last
be
perform
,
by
hoist
up
the
criminal
by
his
hand
tie
behind
his
back
,
on
a
pulley
about
two
story
high
;
from
whence
,
the
rope
be
suddenly
slacken
,
he
fall
to
within
a
yard
or
two
of
the
ground
,
where
he
be
stop
with
a
violent
shock
arise
from
the
weight
of
his
body
,
and
the
velocity
of
his
descent
,
which
generally
dislocate
his
shoulder
,
with
incredible
pain
.
<EOS>
this
dreadful
execution
be
sometimes
repeat
in
a
few
minute
on
the
same
delinquent
;
so
that
the
very
ligament
be
tear
from
his
joint
,
and
his
arm
be
render
useless
for
life
.
  
<EOS>
the
poverty
of
the
people
in
this
country
,
as
well
as
in
the
South
of
France
,
may
be
conjecture
from
the
appearance
of
their
domestic
animal
.
<EOS>
the
draughthorse
,
mule
,
and
ass
,
of
the
peasant
,
be
so
meagre
,
as
to
excite
compassion
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
dog
to
be
see
in
tolerable
case
;
and
the
cat
be
so
many
emblem
of
famine
,
frightfully
thin
,
and
dangerously
rapacious
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
the
dog
and
they
do
not
devour
young
child
.
<EOS>
another
proof
of
that
indigence
which
reign
among
the
common
people
,
be
this
:
you
may
pass
through
the
whole
South
of
France
,
as
well
as
the
county
of
Nice
,
where
there
be
no
want
of
grove
,
wood
,
and
plantation
,
without
hear
the
song
of
blackbird
,
thrush
,
linnet
,
gold
-
finch
,
or
any
other
bird
whatsoever
.
<EOS>
all
be
silent
and
solitary
.
<EOS>
the
poor
bird
be
destroy
,
or
drive
for
refuge
,
into
other
country
,
by
the
savage
persecution
of
the
people
,
who
spare
no
pain
to
kill
,
and
catch
them
for
their
own
subsistence
.
<EOS>
Scarce
a
sparrow
,
red
-
breast
,
tomtit
,
or
wren
,
can
"
scape
the
gun
and
snare
of
those
indefatigable
fowler
.
<EOS>
even
the
noblesse
make
party
to
go
a
la
chasse
,
a
-
hunting
;
that
is
,
to
kill
those
little
bird
,
which
they
eat
as
gibier
,
or
game
.
  
<EOS>
the
great
poverty
of
the
people
here
,
be
owe
to
their
religion
.
<EOS>
half
of
their
time
be
lose
in
observe
the
great
number
of
festival
;
and
half
of
their
substance
be
give
to
mendicant
friar
and
parish
priest
.
<EOS>
but
if
the
church
occasion
their
indigence
,
it
likewise
,
in
some
measure
,
alleviate
the
horror
of
it
,
by
amuse
them
with
show
,
procession
,
and
even
those
very
feast
,
which
afford
a
recess
from
labour
,
in
a
country
where
the
climate
dispose
them
to
idleness
.
<EOS>
if
the
peasant
in
the
neighbourhood
of
any
chapel
dedicate
to
a
saint
,
whose
day
be
to
be
celebrate
,
have
a
mind
to
make
a
festin
,
in
other
word
,
a
fair
,
they
apply
to
the
commandant
of
Nice
for
a
license
,
which
cost
them
about
a
french
crown
.
<EOS>
this
be
obtain
,
they
assemble
after
service
,
man
and
woman
,
in
their
good
apparel
,
and
dance
to
the
musick
of
fiddle
,
and
pipe
and
tabor
,
or
rather
pipe
and
drum
.
<EOS>
there
be
huckster
'
stand
,
with
pedlary
ware
and
knick
-
knack
for
present
;
cake
and
bread
,
liqueur
and
wine
;
and
thither
generally
resort
all
the
company
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
our
whole
noblesse
at
one
of
these
festin
,
keep
on
the
highway
in
summer
,
mingle
with
an
immense
crowd
of
peasant
,
mule
,
and
ass
,
cover
with
dust
,
and
sweat
at
every
pore
with
the
excessive
heat
of
the
weather
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
much
puzzle
to
tell
whence
their
enjoyment
arise
on
such
occasion
;
or
to
explain
their
motive
for
go
thither
,
unless
they
be
prescribe
it
for
pennance
,
as
a
fore
-
taste
of
purgatory
.
  
<EOS>
now
I
be
speak
of
religious
institution
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
help
observe
,
that
the
antient
Romans
be
still
more
superstitious
than
the
modern
Italians
;
and
that
the
number
of
their
religious
feast
,
sacrifice
,
fast
,
and
holiday
,
be
even
great
than
those
of
the
christian
church
of
Rome
.
<EOS>
They
have
their
festi
and
profesti
,
their
feria
stativae
,
and
conceptivae
,
their
fixed
and
moveable
feast
;
their
esuriale
,
or
fast
day
,
and
their
precidaneae
,
or
vigil
.
<EOS>
the
agonale
be
celebrate
in
January
;
the
carmentale
,
in
January
and
February
;
the
lupercale
and
matronale
,
in
March
;
the
megalesia
in
April
;
the
floralia
,
in
May
;
and
the
matralia
in
June

<EOS>
They

their
saturnalia

robigalia

venalia

vertumnalia

fornacalia

palilia

their

such

the
novemdalia

on
account
of
a

shower

stone

<EOS>
besides
,
every
private
family
have
a
number
of
feria

keep
either
by
way
of
rejoice
for
some
benefit

every

<EOS>
every

<EOS>
there
be
the

be

great

have
sustain

particularly
the
die

or
fifteenth
of
the
kalend
of
December
,
on
which
the
Romans
be
totally
defeat
by
the
Gauls
and
Veientes
;
as
Lucan
say
 
et
damnata

Romanis
allia

,
and
Allia
in
Rome
's
Calendar
condemn'd
.
<EOS>
the
vast
variety
of
their
deity
,
say
to
amount
to
thirty
thousand
,
with
their
respective
rite
of
adoration
,
could
not
fail
to
introduce
such
a
number
of
ceremony
,
shew
,
sacrifice
,
lustration
,
and
public
procession
,
as
must
have
employ
the
people
almost
constantly
from
one
end
of
the
year
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
this
continual
dissipation
must
have
be
a
great
enemy
to
industry
;
and
the
people
must
have
be
idle
and
effeminate
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
be
no
difficult
matter
to
prove
,
that
there
be
very
little
difference
,
in
point
of
character
,
between
the
antient
and
modern
inhabitant
of
Rome
;
and
that
the
great
figure
which
this
empire
make
of
old
,
be
not
so
much
owe
to
the
intrinsic
virtue
of
its
citizen
,
as
to
the
barbarism
,
ignorance
,
and
imbecility
of
the
nation
they
subdue
.
<EOS>
instance
of
public
and
private
virtue
I
find
as
frequent
and
as
strike
in
the
history
of
other
nation
,
as
in
the
annal
of
antient
Rome
;
and
now
that
the
kingdom
and
state
of
Europe
be
pretty
equally
enlighten
,
and
ballance
in
the
scale
of
political
power
,
I
be
of
opinion
,
that
if
the
most
fortunate
general
of
the
Roman
commonwealth
be
again
place
at
the
head
of
the
very
army
they
once
command
,
instead
of
extend
their
conquest
over
all
Europe
and
Asia
,
they
would
hardly
be
able
to
subdue
,
and
retain
under
their
dominion
,
all
the
petty
republic
that
subsist
in
Italy
.
  
<EOS>

I
be

I

you

<EOS>
DEAR
DOCTOR
,
 
in
my
enquiry
about
the
revenue
of
Nice
,
I
be
oblige
to
trust
to
the
information
of
the
inhabitant
,
who
be
much
give
to
exaggerate
.
<EOS>
They
tell
me
,
the
revenue
of
this
town
amount
to
one
hundred
thousand
livre
,
or
five
thousand
pound
sterling
;
of
which
I
would
strike
off
at
least
one
fourth
,
as
an
addition
of
their
own
vanity
:
<EOS>
perhaps
,
if
we
deduct
a
third
,
it
will
be
nearer
the
truth
.
<EOS>
for
,
I
can
not
find
out
any
other
fund
they
have
,
but
the
butchery
and
the
bakery
,
which
they
farm
at
so
much
a
year
to
the
good
bidder
;
and
the
droit
d'entree
,
or
duty
upon
provision
bring
into
the
city
;
but
these
be
very
small
.
<EOS>
the
king
be
say
to
draw
from
Nice
one
hundred
thousand
livre
annually
,
arise
from
a
free
-
gift
,
amount
to
seven
hundred
pound
sterling
,
in
lieu
of
the
taille
,
from
which
this
town
and
county
be
exempt
;
an
inconsiderable
duty
upon
wine
sell
in
public
-
house
;
and
the
droit
du
port
.
<EOS>
these
last
consist
of
anchorage
,
pay
by
all
vessel
in
proportion
to
their
tonnage
,
when
they
enter
the
harbour
of
Nice
and
Villa
Franca
.
<EOS>
besides
,
all
foreign
vessel
,
under
a
certain
stipulate
burthen
,
that
pass
between
the
island
of
Sardinia
and
this
coast
,
be
oblige
,
in
go
to
the
eastward
,
to
enter
;
and
pay
a
certain
regulated
imposition
,
on
pain
of
be
take
and
make
prize
.
<EOS>
the
prince
of
Monaco
exact
a
talliage
of
the
same
kind
;
and
both
he
and
the
king
of
Sardinia
maintain
armed
cruiser
to
assert
this
prerogative
;
from
which
,
however
,
the
English
and
French
be
exempt
by
treaty
,
in
consequence
of
have
pay
a
sum
of
money
at
once
.
<EOS>
in
all
probability
,
it
be
originally
give
as
a
consideration
for
maintain
light
on
the
shore
,
for
the
benefit
of
navigator
,
like
the
toll
pay
for
pass
the
sound
in
the
Baltic
.
<EOS>
[
upon
further
inquiry
I
find
it
be
give
in
consideration
of
be
protect
from
the
Corsairs
by
the
naval
force
of
the
Duke
of
Savoy
and
Prince
of
Monaco
.
]
<EOS>
the
fanal
,
or
lanthorn
,
to
the
eastward
of
Villa
Franca
,
be
keep
in
good
repair
,
and
still
light
in
the
winter
.
<EOS>
the
toll
,
however
,
be
a
very
troublesome
tax
upon
feluccas
,
and
other
small
craft
,
which
be
greatly
retarded
in
their
voyage
,
and
often
lose
the
benefit
of
a
fair
wind
,
by
be
oblige
to
run
inshore
,
and
enter
those
harbour
.
<EOS>
the
tobacco
the
king
manufacture
at
his
own
expence
,
and
sell
for
his
own
profit
,
at
a
very
high
price
;
and
every
person
convict
of
sell
this
commodity
in
secret
,
be
send
to
the
gallie
for
life
.
<EOS>
the
salt
come
chiefly
from
Sardinia
,
and
be
store
up
in
the
king
's
magazine
from
whence
it
be
export
to
Piedmont
,
and
other
part
of
his
inland
dominion
.
<EOS>
and
here
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
observe
,
that
Sardinia
produce
very
good
horse
,
well
-
shape
,
though
small
;
strong
,
hardy
,
full
of
mettle
,
and
easily
feed
.
<EOS>
the
whole
county
of
Nice
be
say
to
yield
the
king
half
a
million
of
livre
,
about
twenty
-
five
thousand
pound
sterling
,
arise
from
a
small
donative
make
by
every
town
and
village
:
for
the
land
pay
no
tax
,
or
imposition
,
but
the
tithe
to
the
church
.
<EOS>
His
revenue
then
flow
from
the
gabelle
on
salt
and
wine
,
and
these
free
-
gift
;
so
that
we
may
strike
off
one
fifth
of
the
sum
at
which
the
whole
be
estimate
;
and
conclude
,
that
the
king
draw
from
the
county
at
Nice
,
about
four
hundred
thousand
livre
,
or
twenty
thousand
pound
sterling
.
<EOS>
that
his
revenue
from
Nice
be
not
great
,
appear
from
the
smallness
of
the
appointment
allow
to
his
officer
.
<EOS>
the
president
have
about
three
hundred
pound
per
annum
;
and
the
intendant
about
two
.
<EOS>
the
pay
of
the
commandant
do
not
exceed
three
hundred
and
fifty
pound
:
but
he
have
certain
privilege
call
the
tour
du
baton
,
some
of
which
a
man
of
spirit
would
not
insist
upon
.
<EOS>
He
who
command
at
present
,
have
no
estate
of
his
own
,
enjoy
a
small
commandery
,
which
be
add
to
his
appointment
at
Nice
,
make
the
whole
amount
to
about
five
hundred
pound
sterling
.
  
<EOS>
if
we
may
believe
the
politician
of
Nice
,
the
king
of
Sardinia
's
whole
revenue
do
not
fall
short
of
twenty
million
of
piedmontese
livre
,
be
above
one
million
of
our
money
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
own
,
that
there
be
no
country
in
Christendom
less
taxed
than
that
of
Nice
;
and
as
the
soil
produce
the
necessary
of
life
,
the
inhabitant
,
with
a
little
industry
,
may
renew
the
golden
age
in
this
happy
climate
,
among
their
grove
,
wood
,
and
mountain
,
beautify
with
fountain
,
brooks
,
river
,
torrent
,
and
cascade
.
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
these
pastoral
advantage
,
the
peasant
be
poor
and
miserable
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
stock
to
begin
the
world
with
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
lease
of
the
land
they
cultivate
;
but
entirely
depend
,
from
year
to
year
,
on
the
pleasure
of
the
arbitrary
landholder
,
who
may
turn
them
out
at
a
minute
's
warning
;
and
they
be
oppress
by
the
mendicant
friar
and
parish
priest
,
who
rob
them
of
the
good
fruit
of
their
labour
:
after
all
,
the
ground
be
too
scanty
for
the
number
of
family
which
be
croude
on
it
.
  
<EOS>
You
desire
to
know
the
state
of
the
art
and
science
at
Nice
;
which
,
indeed
,
be
almost
a
total
blank
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
man
of
talent
<EOS>
this
place
may
have
formerly
produce
;
but
at
present
,
it
seem
to
be
consecrate
to
the
reign
of
dulness
and
superstition
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
surprising
,
to
see
a
people
establish
between
two
enlighten
nation
,
so
devoid
of
taste
and
literature
.
<EOS>
here
be
no
tolerable
picture
,
bust
,
statue
,
nor
edifice
:
the
very
ornament
of
the
church
be
wretchedly
conceive
,
and
worse
execute
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
public
,
nor
private
library
that
afford
any
thing
worth
peruse
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
even
a
bookseller
in
Nice
.
<EOS>
though
they
value
themselves
upon
their

native
of
Italy
,
they
be
unacquainted
with
music
.
<EOS>
the
few
that
play
upon
instrument
,
attend
only
to
the
execution
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
genius
nor
taste

nor
any
knowledge
of
harmony
and
composition
.
<EOS>
among
the
French

a
Nissard

;
but
in
Florence
,
Milan
,
or
Rome
,
he
claim
the
honour
of
be
bear
a

Italy
.
<EOS>
the
people
of
condition
here
speak
both
language
equally
well
;
or
,
rather
,
equally
ill
;
for
they
use
a
low
,
uncouth
phraseology
;
and
their
pronunciation
be
extremely
vitious
.
<EOS>
Their
vernacular
tongue
be
what
they
call
Patois
;
though
in
so
call
it
,
they
do
it
injustice
.
 
<EOS>
Patois
,
from
the
latin
word
patavinita
,
mean
no
more
than
a
provincial
accent
,
or
dialect
.
<EOS>
It
take
its
name
from
Patavium
,
or
Padua
,
which
be
the
birthplace
of
Livy
,
who
,
with
all
his
merit
as
a
writer
,
have
admit
into
his
history
,
some
provincial
expression
of
his
own
country
.
<EOS>
the
Patois
,
or
native
tongue
of
Nice
,
be
no
other
than
the
ancient
Provencal
,
from
which
the
italian
,
spanish
and
french
language
,
have
be
form
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
language
that
rise
upon
the
ruin
of
the
latin
tongue
,
after
the
irruption
of
the
Goths
,
Vandals
,
Huns
,

Burgundians
,
by
whom
the
roman
empire
be
destroy
.
<EOS>
It
be
speak
all
over
Italy
,
Spain
,
and
the
southern
part
of
France
,
until
the
thirteenth
century
,
when
the
Italians
begin
to
polish
it
into
the
language
which
they
now
call
their
own
:
the
Spaniards
and
French
,
likewise
,
improve
it
into
their
respective
tongue
.
<EOS>
from
its
great
affinity
to
the
Latin
,
it
be
call
Romance
,
a
name
which
the
Spaniards
still
give
to
their
own
language
.
<EOS>
as
the
first
legend
of
knight
-
errantry
be
write
in
Provencal
,
all
subsequent
performance
of
the
same
kind
,
have
derive
from
it
the
name
of
romance
;
and
as
those
annal
of
chivalry
contain
extravagant
adventure
of
knight
,
giant
,
and
necromancer
,
<EOS>
every
improbable
story

be
to
this

<EOS>
Mr
Walpole
,
in
his
Catalogue
of

Authors
,
have
produce
two
sonnet
in
the
antient
Provencal
,
write
by
our

Richard
I
surname
Coeur

;
and
Voltaire
,
in
his
Historical
Tracts
,
have
favour
the
world
with
some
specimen
of
the
same
language
.
<EOS>
the
Patois
of
Nice
,
must
,
without
doubt
,
have
undergo
change
and
corruption
in
the
course
of
so
many
age
,
especially
as
no
pain
have
be
take
to
preserve
its
original
purity
,
either
in
orthography
or
pronunciation
.
<EOS>
It
be
neglect
,
as
the
language
of
the
vulgar
:
and
scarce
any
-
body
here
know
either
its
origin
or
constitution
.
<EOS>
I
have
in
vain
endeavour
to
procure
some
piece
in
the
antient
Provencal
,
that
I
may
compare
them
with
the
modern
Patois
:
but
I
can
find
no
person
to
give
me
the
least
information
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
the
shade
of
ignorance
,
sloth
,
and
stupidity
,
be
impenetrable
.
<EOS>
almost
every
word
of
the
Patois
may
still
be
find
in
the
italian
,
spanish
,
and
french
language
,
with
a
small
change
in
the
pronunciation
.
<EOS>
cavallo
,
signify
a
horse
in
italian
and
Spanish
be
call
cavao
;
maison
,
the
french
word
for
a
house
,
be
change
into
maion
;
aqua
,
which
mean
water
in
Spanish
,
the
Nissards
call
daigua
.
<EOS>
to
express
,
what
a
slop
be
here
!
<EOS>
they
say
acco
fa
lac
aqui
,
which
be
a
sentence
compose
of
two
italian
word
,
one
French
,
and
one
Spanish

<EOS>
this
be
nearly
the
proportion
in
which
these
three

will
be
find
mingle
in
the
Patois
of
Nice
;
which
,
with
some
variation
,
extend
over
all
Provence

Languedoc
,

Gascony

<EOS>
I

two

NICE
,
November

,
1764

<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
I
have
once
thought
of
write
a
complete
natural
history
of
this
town
and
county
:
<EOS>
but
I
find
myself
altogether
unequal
to
the
task
.
<EOS>
I
have
neither
health
,
strength
,
nor
opportunity
to
make
proper
collection
of
the
mineral
,
vegetable
,
and
animal
production
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
much
conversant
with
these
branch
of
natural
philosophy
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
book
to
direct
my
inquiry
.
<EOS>
I
can
find
no
person
capable
of
give
me
the
least
information
or
assistance
;
and
I
be
strangely
puzzle
by
the
barbarous
name
they
give
to
many
different
specie
,
the
description
of
which
I
have
read
under
other
appelation
;
and
which
,
as
I
have
never
see
them
before
,
I
can
not
pretend
to
distinguish
by
the
eye
.
<EOS>
You
must
therefore
be
content
with
such
imperfect
intelligence
as
my
opportunity
can
afford
.
  
<EOS>
the
useful
art
practise
at
Nice
,
be
these
,
gardening
and
agriculture
,
with
their
consequence
,
the
making
of
wine
,
oil
,
and
cordage
;
the
rearing
of
silk
-
worm
,
with
the
subsequent
management
and
manufacture
of
that
production
;
and
the
fishing
,
which
I
have
already
describe
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
can
be
more
unpromising
than
the
natural
soil
of
this
territory
,
except
in
a
very
few
narrow
bottom
,
where
there
be
a
stiff
clay
,
which
when
carefully
water
,
yield
tolerable
pasturage
.
<EOS>
in
every
other
part
,
the
soil
consist
of
a
light
sand
mingle
with
pebble
,
which
serve
well
enough
for
the
culture
of
vine
and
olive
:
but
the
ground
lay
out
for
kitchen
herbs
,
as
well
as
for
other
fruit
must
be
manure
with
great
care
and
attention
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
black
cattle
to
afford
such
compost
as
our
farmer
use
in
England
.
<EOS>
the
dung
of
mule
and
ass
,
which
be
their
only
beast
of
burthen
,
be
of
very
little
value
for
this
purpose
;
and
the
natural
sterility
of
their
ground
require
something
highly
impregnate
with
nitre
and
volatile
salt
.
<EOS>
They
have
recourse
therefore
to
pigeon
'
dung
and
ordure
,
which
fully
answer
their
expectation
.
<EOS>
every
peasant
open
,
at
one
corner
of
his
wall
,
a
public
house
of
office
for
the
reception
of
passenger
;
and
in
the
town
of
Nice
,
every
 
tenement
be
provide
with
one
of
these
receptacle
,
the
content
of
which
be
carefully
preserve
for
sale
.
<EOS>
the
peasant
come
with
his
ass
and
cask
to
carry
it
off
before
day
,
and
pay
for
it
accord
to
its
quality
,
which
he
examine
and
investigate
,
by
the
taste
and
flavour
.
<EOS>
the
jake
of
a
protestant
family
,
who
eat
gra
every
day
,
bear
a
much
high
price
than
the
privy
of
a
good
catholic
who
live
maigre
one
half
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
the
vault
belong
to
the
convent
of
Minims
be
not
worth
empty
.
  
<EOS>
the
ground
here
be
not
delve
with
spade
as
in
England
,
but
labour
with
a
broad
,
sharp
hough
,
have
a
short
horizontal
handle
;
and
the
climate
be
so
hot
and
dry
in
the
summer
,
that
the
plant
must
be
water
every
morning
and
evening
,
especially
where
it
be
not
shade
by
tree
.
<EOS>
It
be
surprising
to
see
how
the
production
of
the
earth
be
croude
together
.
<EOS>
one
would
imagine
they
would
rob
one
another
of
nourishment
;
and
moreover
be
stifle
for
want
of
air
;
and
doubtless
this
be
in
some
measure
the
case
.
<EOS>
olive
and
other
fruit
tree
be
plant
in
row
very
close
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
these
be
connect
by
vine
,
and
the
interstice
,
between
the
row
,
be
fill
with
corn
.
<EOS>
the
garden
that
supply
the
town
with
sallad
and
pot
-
herb
,
lye
all
on
the
side
of
Provence
,
by
the
highway
.
<EOS>
They
be
surround
with
high
stone
-
wall
,
or
ditch
,
plant
with
a
kind
of
cane
or
large
reed
,
which
answer
many
purpose
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
the
leave
of
it
afford
sustenance
to
the
ass
,
and
the
cane
not
only
serve
as
fence
to
the
inclosure
;
but
be
use
to
prop
the
vine
and
pease
,
and
to
build
habitation
for
the
silkworm
<EOS>
:
they
be
form
into
arbour
,
and
wear
as
walking
-
stave
.
<EOS>
all
these
garden
be
water
by
little
rill
that
come
from
the
mountain
,
particularly
,
by
the
small
branch
of
the
two
source
which
I
have
describe
in
a
former
letter
,
as
issue
from
the
two
side
of
a
mountain
,
under
the
name
of
Fontaine
de
Muraille
,
and
Fontaine
du
Temple
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Nice
,
they
raise
a
considerable
quantity
of
hemp
,
the
large
and
strong
I
ever
see
.
<EOS>
part
of
this
,
when
dress
,
be
export
to
other
country
;
and
part
be
manufacture
into
cordage
.
<EOS>
however
profitable
it
may
be
to
the
grower
,
it
be
certainly
a
great
nuisance
in
the
summer
.
<EOS>
when
take
out
of
the
pit
,
where
it
have
be
put
to
rot
,
the
stench
it
raise
be
quite
insupportable
;
and
must
undoubtedly
be
unwholesome
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
such
a
want
of
land
in
this
neighbourhood
,
that
terrace
be
build
over
one
another
with
loose
stone
,
on
the
face
of
bare
rock
,
and
these
be
cover
with
earth
and
manure
,
be
plant
with
olive
,
vine
,
and
corn
.
<EOS>
the
same
shift
be
practise
all
over
Palestine
,
which
be
rocky
and
barren
,
and
much
more
populous
than
the
county
of
Nice
.
  
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
small
extent
of
this
territory
,
there
be
some
pleasant
meadow
in
the
skirt
of
Nice
,
that
produce
excellent
clover
;
and
the
corn
which
be
sow
in
open
field
,
where
it
have
the
full
benefit
of
the
soil
,
sun
,
and
air
,
grow
to
a
surprizing
height
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
rye
seven
or
eight
foot
high
.
<EOS>
all
vegetable
have
a
wonderful
growth
in
this
climate
.
<EOS>
besides
wheat

rye
,
barley
,
and
oats
,
this
country
produce
a
good
deal
of
Meliga

or
turkish
wheat
,
which
be
what
we
call
indian
corn
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
in
a
former
letter
,
observe
that
the
meal
of
this
grain
go
by
the
name
polenta
,
and
make
excellent
hasty
-
pudding
,
be
very
nourishing
,
and
count
an
admirable
pectoral
.
<EOS>
the
pod
and
stalk
be
use
for
fuel
:
and
the
leave
be
much
preferable
to
common
straw
,
for
make
paillasse
.
  
<EOS>
the
pease
and
bean
in
the
garden
appear
in
the
winter
like
beautiful
plantation
of
young

in
blossom

and
perfume

<EOS>
It
be
not
many
year
since
the
Nissards
learn
the
culture
of
silk
-
worm
,
of
their
neighbour
the
Piedmontese
;
and
hitherto
the
progress
they
have
make
be
not
very
considerable
:
the
whole
county
of
Nice
produce
about
one
hundred
and
thirty
-
three
bale
of
three
hundred
pound
each
,
amount
in
value
to
four
hundred
thousand

.
  
<EOS>
in
the
beginning
of
April
,
when
the
mulberry
-
leave
,
begin
to
put
forth
,
the
egg
or
grain
that
produce
the
silk
-
worm
,
be
hatch
.
<EOS>
the
grain
be
wash
in
wine
,
and
those
that
swim
on
the
top
,
be
throw
away
as
good
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
the
rest
be
deposit
in
small
bag
of
linen
,
be
wear
by
woman
in
their
bosom
,
until
the
worm
begin
to
appear
:
then
they
be
place
in
shallow
wooden
box
,
cover
with
a
piece
of
white
paper
,
cut
into
little
hole
,
through
which
the
worm
ascend
as
they

hatch
,
to
feed
on
the
young
mulberry
-
leave
,
of
which
there
be
a
layer
above
the
paper
.
<EOS>
these
box
be
keep
for
warmth
between
two
mattrasse
,
and
visit
every
day
.
<EOS>
fresh
leave
be
lay
in
,
and
the
worm
that
feed
be
remove
successively
to
the
other
place
prepare
for
their
reception
.
<EOS>
this
be
an
habitation
,
consist
of
two
or
three
story
,
about
twenty
inch
from
each
other

raise
upon
four
wooden
post

<EOS>
the
floor
be
make
of
cane
,
and
strew
with
fresh
mulberry
-
leave
:
the
corner
post
,
and
other
occasional

,
for
sustain
the
different
floor
,
be
cover
with
a
coat
of
loose
heath
,
which
be
twist
round
the
wood
.
<EOS>
the
worm
when
hatch
be
lay
upon
the
floor
;
and
here
you
may
see
them
in
all
the
different
stage
(
if
moult
or
cast
the
slough
,
a
change
which
they
undergo
three
time
successively
before
they
begin
to
work
.
<EOS>
the
silk
-
worm
be
an
animal
of
such
acute
and
delicate
sensation
,
that
too
much
care
can
not
be
take
to
keep
its
habitation
clean
,
and
to
refresh
it
from
time
to
time
with
pure
air
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
them
languish
and
die
in
score
,
in
consequence
of
an
accidental
bad
smell
.
<EOS>
the
soiled
leave
,
and
the
filth
which
they
necessarily
produce
,
should
be
carefully
shift
every
day
;
and
it
would
not
be
amiss
to
purify
the
air
sometimes
with
fume
of
vinegar
,
rise
,
or
orange
-
flower
water
.
<EOS>
these
nicety
,
however
,
be
but
little
observed
.
<EOS>
They
commonly
lie
in
heap
as
thick
as
shrimp
in
a
plate
,
some
feed
on
the
leave
,
some
new
hatch
,
some
intrance
in
the
agony
of
cast
their
skin
,
sonic
languishing
,
and
some
actually
dead
,
with
a
litter
of
half

eat
fade
leave
about
them
,
in
a
close
room
,
croude
with
woman
and
child
,
not
at
all
remarkable
for
their
cleanliness
.
<EOS>
I
be
assure
by
some
person
of
credit
,
that
if
they
be
touch
,
or
even
approach
,
by
a
woman
in
her
catamenia
,
they
infallibly
expire
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
must
be
understand
of
those
female
whose
skin
have
naturally
a
very
rank
flavour
,
which
be
generally
heighten
at
such
period
.
<EOS>
the
mulberry
-
leave
use
in
this
country
be
of
the
tree
which
bear
a
small
white
fruit
not
large
than
a
damascene
.
<EOS>
They
be
plant
on
purpose
,
and
the
leave
be
sell
at
so
much
a
pound
.
<EOS>
by
the
middle
of
June
all
the
mulberry
-
tree
be
strip
;
but
new
leave
succeed
,
and
in
a
few
week
,
they
be
cloathe
again
with
fresh
verdure
.
<EOS>
in
about
ten
day
after
the
last
moulting
,
the
silk
-
worm
climb
upon
the
prop
of
his
house
,
and
choose
a
situation
among
the
heath
,
begin
to
spin
in
a
most
curious
manner
,
until
he
be
quite
inclosed
,
  
and
the
cocon
or
pod
of
silk
,
about
the
size
of
a
pigeon
's
egg
,
which
he
have
produce
remain
suspend
by
several
filament
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
unusual
to
see
double
cocon
,
spin
by
two
worm
include
under
a
common
cover
.
<EOS>
there
must
be
an
infinite
number
of
worm
to
yield
any
considerable
quantity
of
silk
.
<EOS>
one
ounce
of
egg
or
grain
produce
,
four
rup
,
or
one
hundred
nice
pound
of
cocon
;
and
one
rup
,
or
twenty
-
five
pound
of
cocon
,
if
they
be
rich
,
give
three
pound
of
raw
silk
;
that
is
,
twelve
pound
of
silk
be
get
from
one
ounce
of
grain
,
which
ounce
of
grain
its
produce
by
as
many
worm
as
be
inclose
in
one
pound
,
or
twelve
ounce
of
cocon
.
<EOS>
in
preserve
the
cocon
for
breed
,
you
must
choose
an
equal
number
of
male
and
female
;
and
these
be
very
easily
distinguish
by
the
shape
of
the
cocon
;
that
which
contain
the
male
be
sharp
,
and
the
other
obtuse
,
at
the
two
end
.
<EOS>
in
ten
or
twelve
day
after
the
cocon
be
finish
,
the
worm
make
its
way
through
it
,
in
the
form
of
a
very
ugly
,
unwieldy
,
aukward
butterfly
,
and
as
the
different
sex
be
place
by
one
another
on
paper
or
linen
,
they
immediately
engender
.
<EOS>
the
female
lay
her
egg
,
which
be
carefully
preserve
;
but
neither
she
nor
her
mate
take
any
nourishment
,
and
in
eight
or
ten
day
after
they
quit
the
cocon
,
they
generally
die
.
<EOS>
the
silk
of
these
cocon
can
not
be
wind
,
because
the
animal
in
pierce
through
them
,
have
destroy
the
continuity
of
the
filament
.
<EOS>
It
be
therefore
,
first
boil
,
and
then
pick
and
card
like
wool
,
and
be
afterwards
spin
,
be
use
in
the
coarser
stuff
of
the
silk
manufacture
.
<EOS>
the
other
cocon
,
which
yield
the
good
silk
,
be
manage
in
a
different
manner
.
<EOS>
before
the
inclose
worm
have
time
to
penetrate
,
the
silk
be
reel
off
with
equal
care
and
ingenuity
.
<EOS>
a
handful
of
the
cocon
be
throw
away
into
a
kettle
of
boiling
water
,
which
not
only
kill
the
animal
,
but
dissolve
the
glutinous
substance
by
which
the
fine
filament
of
the
silk
cohere
or
stick
together
,
so
that
they
be
easily
wind
off
,
without
break
.
<EOS>
six
or
seven
of
these
small
filament
be
join
together
be
pass
over
a
kind
of
twisting
iron
,
and
fix
to
the
wheel
,
which
one
girl
turn
,
while
another
,
with
her
hand
in
the
boiling
water
,
disentangle
the
thread
,
join
them
when
they
chance
to
break
,
and
supply
fresh
cocon
with
admirable
dexterity
and
dispatch
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
manufacture
of
this
kind
just
without
one
of
the
gate
of
Nice
,
where
forty
or
fifty
of
these
wheel
be
work
together
,
and
give
employment
for
some
week
to
double
the
number
of
young
woman
.
<EOS>
those
who
manage
the
pod
that
float
in
the
boiling
water
must
be
very
alert
,
otherwise
they
will
scald
their
finger
.
<EOS>
the
smell
that
come
from
the
boiling
cocon
be
extremely
offensive

<EOS>
hard
by
the
harbour
,
there
be
a
very
curious
mill
for
twist
the
silk

which
go

<EOS>
there
be
in
the
town
of
Nice

a
well
regulated
hospital

one
hundred

<EOS>
in
the
village
of
Provence

you
see
the
poor
woman
in
the
street
spin
raw
silk
upon
distave

here
the

SIR
,
 
<EOS>
in
my
last
,
I
give
you
a
succinct
account
of
the
silkworm
,
and
the
management
of
that
curious
insect
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
I
shall
now
proceed
to
describe
the
method
of
make
wine
and
oil
.
  
<EOS>
the
vintage
begin
in
September
.
<EOS>
the
grape
be
choose
and
carefully
pick
,
be
put
into
a
large
vat
,
where
they
be
press
by
a
man
's
naked
foot
,
and
the
juice
draw
off
by
a
cock
below
.
<EOS>
when
no
more
be
procure
by
this
operation
,
the
bruise
grape
be
put
into
the
press
,
and
yield
still
more
liquor
.
<EOS>
the
juice
obtain
by
this
double
pressure
,
be
put
in
cask
,
with
their
bung
open
,
begin
to
ferment
and
discharge
its
impurity
at
the
opening
.
<EOS>
the
waste
occasion
by
this
discharge
,
be
constantly
supply
with
fresh
wine
,
so
that
the
cask
be
always
full
.
<EOS>
the
fermentation
continue
for
twelve
,
fifteen
,
or
twenty
day
,
accord
to
the
strength
and
vigour
of
the
grape
.
<EOS>
in
about
a
month
,
the
wine
be
fit
for
drinking
.
<EOS>
when
the
grape
be
of
a
bad
,
meagre
kind
,
the
wine
dealer
mix
the
juice
with
pigeons'-dung
or
quick
-
lime
,
in
order
to
give
it
a
spirit
which
nature
have
deny
:
but
this
be
a
very
mischievous
adulteration
.
  
<EOS>
the
process
for
oil
-
making
be
equally
simple
.
<EOS>
the
good
olive
be
those
that
grow
wild
;
but
the
quantity
of
them
be
very
inconsiderable
.
<EOS>
olive
begin
to
ripen
and
drop
in
the
beginning
of
November
:
but
some
remain
on
the
tree
till
February
,
and
even
till
April
,
and
these
be
count
the
most
valuable
.
<EOS>
when
the
olive
be
gather
,
they
must
be
manufacture
immediately
,
before
they
fade
and
grow
wrinkle
,
otherwise
they
will
produce
bad
oil
.
<EOS>
They
be
first
of
all
ground
into
a
paste
by
a
mill
-
stone
set
edge
-
way
in
a
circular
stone
-
trough
,
the
wheel
be
turn
by
water
.
  
<EOS>
this
paste
be
put
into
trail
or
circular
case
make
of
grass
weave
,
have
a
round
hole
at
top
and
bottom
;
when
fill
they
resemble
in
shape
our
Cheshire
cheese
.
<EOS>
a
number
of
these
place
one
upon
another
,
be
put
in
a
press
,
and
be
squeeze
,
the
oil
with
all
its
impurity
,
run
into
a
receptacle
below
fix
in
the
ground
.
<EOS>
from
hence
it
be
lade
into
a
wooden
vat
,
half
fill
with
water
.
<EOS>
the
sorde
or
dirt
fall
to
the
bottom
;
the
oil
swim
a
-
top
;
and
be
skim
off
,
be
barrel
up
in
small
oblong
cask
.
<EOS>
what
remain
in
the
vat
,
be
throw
into
a
large
stone
cistern
with
water
,
and
after
be
often
stir
,
and
stand
twelve
or
fourteen
day
,
yield
a
coarser
oil
use
for
lamp
and
manufacture
.
<EOS>
after
these
process
,
they
extract
an
oil
still
more
coarse
and
fetid
from
the
refuse
of
the
whole
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
in
order
to
make
the
olive
grind
the
more
easily
into
a
paste
,
and
part
with
more
oil
,
they
be
mix
with
a
little
hot
water
:
but
the
oil
thus
procure
be
apt
to
grow
rancid
.
<EOS>
the
very
fine
,
call
virgin
oil
,
be
make
chiefly
of
green
olive
,
and
sell
at
a
very
high
price
,
because
a
great
quantity
be
require
to
produce
a
very
little
oil
.
<EOS>
even
the
stuff
that
be
leave
after
all
these
operation
,
consist
of
the
dry
pulp
,
be
sell
for
fuel
,
and
use
in
brasiere
for
warming
apartment
which
have
no
chimney
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
now
specify
all
the
manufacture
of
Nice
which
be
worth
mention
.
<EOS>
true
it
be
,
there
be
some
coarse
paper
make
in
this
neighbourhood
;
there
be
also
people
here
who
dress
skin
and
make
leather
for
the
use
of
the
inhabitant
:
but
this
business
be
very
ill
perform
:
the
glove
and
shoe
be
generally
rotten
as
they
come
from
the
hand
of
the
maker
.
<EOS>
Carpenter
's
,
joiner
's
,
and
blacksmith
's
work
be
very
coarsely
and
clumsily
do
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
chair
to
be
have
at
Nice
,
but
crazy
thing
make
of
a
few
stick
,
with
rush
bottom
,
which
be
sell
for
twelve
livre
a
dozen
.
<EOS>
nothing
can
be
more
contemptible
than
the
hard
-
ware
make
in
this
place
,
such
as
knife
,
scissor
,
and
candle
-
snuffer
.
<EOS>
all
utensil
in
brass
and
copper
be
very
ill
make
and
finish
.
<EOS>
the
silver
-
smith
make
nothing
but
spoon
,
fork
,
paultry
ring
,
and
crosse
for
the
neck
of
the
woman
.
  
<EOS>
the
house
be
build
of
a
ragged
stone
dig
from
the
mountain
,
and
the
interstice
be
fill
with
rubble
;
so
that
the
wall
would
appear
very
ugly
,
if
they
be
not
cover
with
plaister
,
which
have
a
good
effect
.
<EOS>
They
generally
consist
of
three
story
,
and
be
cover
with
tile
.
<EOS>
the
apartment
of
the
well
sort
be
large
and
lofty
,
the
floor
pave
with
brick
,
the
roof
cover
with
a
thick
coat
of
stucco
,
and
the
wall
whitewash
.
<EOS>
People
of
distinction
hang
their
chamber
with
damask
,
stripe
silk
,
paint
cloth
,
tapestry
,
or
print
linnen
.
<EOS>
all
the
door
,
as
well
as
the
window
,
consist
of
fold
leave
.
<EOS>
as
there
be
no
wainscot
in
the
room
,
which
be
divide
by
stone
partition
and
the
floor
and
cieling
be
cover
with
brick
and
stucco
,
fire
be
of
much
less
dreadful
consequence
here
than
in
our
country
.
<EOS>
Wainscot
would
afford
harbour
for
bug
:
besides
,
white
wall
have
a
well
effect
in
this
hot
climate
.
<EOS>
the
bed
commonly
use
in
this
place
,
and
all
over
Italy
,
consist
of
a
paillasse
,
with
one
or
two
mattrasse
,
lay
upon
plank
,
support
by
two
wooden
bench
.
<EOS>
instead
of
curtain
there
be
a
couziniere
or
mosquito
net
,
make
of
a
kind
of
gauze
,
that
open
and
contract
occasionally
,
and
inclose
the
place
where
you
lie
:
person
of
condition
,
however
,
have
also
bedstead
and
curtain
;
but
these
last
be
never
use
in
the
summer
.
  
<EOS>
in
these
country
,
people
of
all
rank
dine
exactly
at
noon
;
and
this
be
the
time
I
seize
in
winter
,
for
make
my
daily
tour
of
the
street
and
rampart
,
which
at
all
other
hour
of
the
day
be
crowd
with
man
,
woman
,
child
and
beast
of
burthen
.
<EOS>
the
rampart
be
the
common
road
for
carriage
of
all
kind
.
<EOS>
I
think
there
be
two
private
coach
in
Nice
,
besides
that
of
the
commandant
:
but
there
be
sedan
chair
,
which
may
be
have
at
a
reasonable
rate
.
<EOS>
when
I
bathe
in
the
summer
,
I
pay
thirty
sol
,
equal
to
eighteen
-
penny
,
for
be
carry
to
and
from
the
bathing
place
,
which
be
a
mile
from
my
own
house
.
  
<EOS>
now
I
be
speak
of
bathe
,
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
inform
you
that
though
there
be
a
fine
open
beach
,
extend
several
mile
to
the
westward
of
Nice
,
those
who
can
not
swim
ought
to
bathe
with
great
precaution
,
as
the
sea
be
very
deep
,
and
the
descent
very
abrupt
from
within
a
yard
or
two
of
the
water
's
edge
.
<EOS>
the
people
here
be
much
surprised
when
I
begin
to
bathe
in
the
beginning
of
<EOS>
May
They
think
it
very
strange
,
that
a
man
seemingly
consumptive
should
plunge
into
the
sea
,
especially
when
the
weather
be
so
cold
;
and
some
of
the
doctor
prognosticate
immediate
death
.
<EOS>
but
,
when
it
be
perceive
that
I
grow
well
in
consequence
of
the
bath
,
some
of
the
swiss
officer
try
the
same
experiment
,
and
in
a
few
day
,
our
example
be
follow
by
several
inhabitant
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
however
,
no
convenience
for
this
operation
,
from
the
benefit
of
which
the
fair
sex
must
be
intirely
exclude
,
unless
they
lay
aside
all
regard
to
decorum
;
for
the
shore
be
always
line
with
fishing
-
boat
,
and
croude
with
people
.
<EOS>
if
a
lady
should
be
at
the
expence
of
have
a
tent
pitch
on
the
beach
where
she
may
put
on
and
of
her
bathing
-
dress
,
she
could
not
pretend
to
go
into
the
sea
without
proper
attendant
;
nor
could
she
possibly
plunge
headlong
into
the
water
,
which
be
the
most
effectual
,
and
least
dangerous
way
of
bathe
.
<EOS>
all
that
she
can
do
be
to
have
the
sea
-
water
bring
into
her
house
,
and
make
use
of
a
bathing
-
tub
,
which
may
be
make
accord
to
her
own
,
or
physician
's
direction
.
  
<EOS>
what
further
I
have
to
say
of
this
climate
and
country
,
you
shall
have
in
my
next
;
and
then
you
will
be
release
from
a
subject
,
which
I
be
afraid
<EOS>
have
be
but
too
circumstantially
handle
by
  
Sir
,
Your
very
humble
servant

<EOS>
NICE
,
January
4
,
1765
.
  
<EOS>
dear
SIR
.
<EOS>
,
 
<EOS>
the
constitution
of
this
climate
may
be
pretty
well
ascertained
,
from
the
inclose
register
of
the
weather
,
which
I
keep
with
all
possible
care
and
attention
.
<EOS>
from
a
perusal
of
it
,
you
will
see
that
there
be
less
rain
and
wind
at
Nice
,
than
in
any
other
part
of
the
world
that
I
know
;
and
such
be
the
serenity
of
the
air
,
that
you
see
nothing
above
your
head
for
several
month
together
,
but
a
charming
blue
expanse
,
without
cloud
or
speck
.
<EOS>
whatever
cloud
may
be
form
by
evaporation
of
the
sea
,
they
seldom
or
never
hover
over
this
small
territory
;
but
,
in
all
probability
,
be
attract
by
the
mountain
that
surround
it
,
and
there
fall
in
rain
or
snow
:
<EOS>
as
for
those
that
gather
from
other
quarter
,
I
suppose
their
progress
hitherward
be
obstruct
by
those
very
Alps
,
which
rise
one
over
another
,
to
an
extent
of
many
league
.
<EOS>
this
air
be
dry
,
pure
,
heavy
,
and
elastic
,
must
be
agreeable
to
the
constitution
of
those
who
labour
under
disorder
arise
from
weak
nerve
,
obstruct
perspiration
,
relaxed
fibre
,
a
viscidity
of
lymph
,
and
a
languid
circulation
.
<EOS>
in
other
respect
,
it
encourage
the
scurvy
,
the
atmosphere
be
undoubtedly
impregnate
with
sea
-
salt
.
<EOS>
ever
since
my
arrival
at
Nice
,
I
have
have
a
scorbutical
eruption
on
my
right
hand
,
which
diminish
and
increase
accord
to
the
state
of
my
health
.
<EOS>
one
day
last
summer
,
when
there
be
a
strong
breeze
from
the
sea
,
the
surface
of
our
body
be
cover
with
a
salt
brine
,
very
perceptible
to
the
taste
;
my
gum
,
as
well
as
those
of
another
person
in
my
family
,
begin
to
swell
,
and
grow
painful
,
though
this
have
never
happen
before
;
and
I
be
seize
with
violent
pain
in
the
joint
of
my
knee
.
<EOS>
I
be
then
at
a
country
-
house
front
the
sea
,
and
particularly
expose
to
the
marine
air
.
<EOS>
the
swelling
of
our
gum
subside
as
the
wind
fall
:
but
what
be
very
remarkable
,
the
scurvy
-
spot
on
my
hand
disappear
,
and
do
not
return
for
a
whole
month
.
<EOS>
It
be
affirm
that
sea
-
salt
will
dissolve
,
and
render
the
blood
so
fluid
,
that
it
will
exude
through
the
coat
of
the
vessel
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
sea
-
scurvy
be
a
partial
dissolution
of
it
,
by
that
mineral
absorb
from
the
air
by
the
lymphatic
on
the
surface
of
the
body
,
and
by
those
of
the
lung
in
respiration
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
in
the
last
stage
of
the
sea
-
scurvy
,
the
blood
often
burst
from
the
pore
;
and
this
phaenomenon
be
impute
to
a
high
degree
of
putrefaction
:
sure
enough
it
be
attend
with
putrefaction
.
<EOS>
We
know
that
a
certain
quantity
of
salt
be
require
to
preserve
the
animal
juice
from
go
putrid
:
<EOS>
but
,
how
a
great
quantity
should
produce
putrefaction
,
I
leave
to
wise
head
to
explain
.
<EOS>
many
people
here
have
scorbutical
complaint
,
though
their
tooth
be
not
affect
.
<EOS>
They
be
subject
to
eruption
on
the
skin
,
putrid
gum
,
pain
in
the
bone
,
lassitude
,
indigestion
,
and
low
spirit
;
but
the
reign
distemper
be
a
marasmus
,
or
consumption
,
which
proceed
gradually
,
without
any
pulmonary
complaint
,
the
complexion
grow
more
and
more
florid
,
 
'
till
the
very
last
scene
of
the
tragedy
.
<EOS>
this
I
would
impute
to
the
effect
of
a
very
dry
,
saline
atmosphere
,
upon
a
thin
habit
,
in
which
there
be
an
extraordinary
waste
by
perspiration
.
<EOS>
the
air
be
remarkably
salt
in
this
district
,
because
the
mountain
that
hem
it
in
,
prevent
its
communication
with
the
circumambient
atmosphere
,
in
which
the
saline
particle
would
otherwise
be
diffuse
;
and
there
be
no
rain
,
nor
dew
,
to
precipitate
or
dissolve
them
.
<EOS>
such
an
air
as
I
have
describe
,
should
have
no
bad
effect
upon
a
moist
,
phlegmatic
constitution
,
such
as
mine
;
and
yet
it
must
be
own
,
I
have
be
visibly
waste
since
I
come
hither
,
though
this
decay
I
consider
as
the
progress
of
the
tabe
which
begin
in
England
.
<EOS>
but
the
air
of
Nice
have
have
a
still
more
sensible
effect
upon
Mr
Sch
--
z
,
who
labour
under
nervous
complaint
to
such
a
degree
,
that
life
be
a
burthen
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
also
a
fix
pain
in
his
breast
,
for
which
complaint
<EOS>
he
have
formerly
try
the
air
of
Naples
,
where
he
reside
some
considerable
time
,
and
in
a
great
measure
recover
:
but
,
this
return
with
weakness
,
faintness
,
low
spirit
,
and
entire
loss
of
appetite
,
he
be
advise
to
come
hither
;
and
the
success
of
his
journey
have
greatly
exceed
his
expectation
.
<EOS>
though
the
weather
have
be
remarkably
bad
for
this
climate
,
he
have
enjoy
perfect
health
.
<EOS>
since
he
arrive
at
Nice
,
the
pain
in
his
breast
have
vanish
;
he
eat
heartily
,
sleep
well
,
be
in
high
spirit
,
and
so
strong
,
that
he
be
never
off
his
leg
in
the
day
-
time
.
<EOS>
He
can
walk
to
the
var
and
back
again
,
before
dinner
;
and
he
have
climb
to
the
top
of
all
the
mountain
in
this
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
before
such
sudden
and
happy
effect
from
the
change
of
air
.
<EOS>
I
must
also
acknowledge
,
that
ever
since
my
arrival
at
Nice
,
I
have
breathe
more
freely
than
I
have
do
for
some
year
,
and
my
spirit
have
be
more
alert
.
<EOS>
the
father
of
my
housekeeper
,
who
be
a
dancing
-
master
,
have
be
so
afflict
with
an
asthmatic
disorder
,
that
he
could
not
live
in
France
,
Spain
,
or
Italy
;
but
find
the
air
of
Nice
so
agreeable
to
his
lung
,
that
he
be
enable
to
exercise
his
profession
for
above
twenty
year
,
and
die
last
spring
turn
of
seventy
.
<EOS>
another
advantage
I
have
reap
from
this
climate
be
my
being
,
in
a
great
measure
,
deliver
from
a
slow
fever
which
use
to
hang
about
me
,
and
render
life
a
burthen
.
<EOS>
neither
be
I
so
apt
to
catch
cold
as
I
use
to
be
in
England
and
France
;
and
the
cold
I
do
catch
be
not
of
the
same
continuance
and
consequence
,
as
those
to
which
I
be
formerly
subject
.
<EOS>
the
air
of
Nice
be
so
dry
,
that
in
summer
,
and
even
in
winter
,
(
except
ill
wet
weather
)
you
may
pass
the
evening
,
and
indeed
the
whole
night
,
sub
Dio
,
without
feel
the
least
dew
or
moisture
;
and
as
for
fog
,
they
be
never
see
in
this
district
.
<EOS>
in
summer
,
the
air
be
cool
by
a
regular
sea
-
breeze
blow
from
the
cast
,
like
that
of
the
West
-
Indies
.
<EOS>
It
begin
in
the
forenoon
,
and
increase
with
the
heat
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
It
die
away
about
six
or
seven
;
and
immediately
after
sun

<EOS>
about

the

of
Nice
expect
wind

which
generally

break

it

the
rainy
season
be

equinox

something
later

<EOS>
It
continue
about
twelve
day

<EOS>
this

in

case
,
the

dry

<EOS>
the
heavy
rain
in

generally
come

which
be
the

the

<EOS>
It

a

it
generally
blow
high

It

for

<EOS>
during

the

be
variable

<EOS>
from
the
sixteenth
of
November
,
 
'
till
the
fourth
of
January
,
we
have
have
two
and
twenty
day
of
heavy
rain
:
a
very
extraordinary
visitation
in
this
country
:
but
the
season
seem
to
be
more
irregular
than
formerly
,
all
over
Europe
.
<EOS>
in
the
month
of
July
,
the
mercury
in
Fahrenheit
's
thermometer
,
rise
to
eighty
-
four
at
Rome
,
the
high
degree
at
which
it
be
ever
know
in
that
country
;
and
the
very
next
day
,
the
Sabine
mountain
be
cover
with
snow
.
<EOS>
the
same
phaemomenon
happen
on
the
eleventh
of
August
,
and
the
thirtieth
of
September
.
<EOS>
the
consequence
of
these
sudden
variation
of
weather
,
be
this
:
putrid
fever
be
less
frequent
than
usual
;
but
the
sudden
cheek
of
perspiration
from
the
cold
,
produce
cold
,
inflammatory
sore
throat
,
and
the
rheumatism
.
<EOS>
I
know
instance
of
some
english
valetudinarian
,
who
have
pass
the
winter
at
Aix
,
on
the
supposition
that
there
be
little
or
no
difference
between
that
air
and
the
climate
of
Nice
:
<EOS>
but
this
be
a
very
great
mistake
,
which
may
be
attend
with
fatal
consequence
.
<EOS>
Aix
be
altogether
expose
to
the
north
and
north
-
west
wind
,
which
blow
as
cold
in
Provence
,
as
ever
I
feel
them
on
the
mountain
of
Scotland
:
whereas
Nice
be
entirely
screened
from
these
wind
by
the
Maritime
Alps
,
which
form
an
amphitheatre
,
to
the
land
-
side
,
around
this
little
territory
:
but
another
incontestible
proof
of
the
mildness
of
this
climate
,
be
deduce
from
the
orange
,
lemon
,
citron
,
rose
,
narcissus
's
,
july
-
flower
,
and
jonquils
,
which
ripen
and
blow
in
the
middle
of
winter
.
<EOS>
I
have
describe
the
agreeable
side
of
this
climate
;
and
now
I
will
point
out
its
inconvenience
.
<EOS>
in
the
winter
,
but
especially
in
the
spring
,
the
sun
be
so
hot
,
that
one
can
hardly
take
exercise
of
any
sort
abroad
,
without
be
throw
into
a
breathing
sweat
;
and
the
wind
at
this
season
be
so
cold
and
piercing
,
that
it
often
produce
a
mischievous
effect
on
the
pore
thus
open
.
<EOS>
if
the
heat
rarify
the
blood
and
juice
,
while
the
cold
air
constringe
the
fibre
,
and
obstruct
the
perspiration
,
inflammatory
disorder
must
ensue
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
the
people
be
then
subject
to
cold
,
pleurisy
,
peripneumonie
,
and
ardent
fever
.
<EOS>
an
old
count
advise
me
to
stay
within
door
in
March
,
car
alor
le
humeurs
commencent
a
se
remuer
,
for
then
the
humour
begin
to
be
in
motion
.
<EOS>
during
the
heat
of
summer
,
some
few
person
of
gross
habit
have
,
in
consequence
of
violent
exercise
and
excess
,
be
seize
with
putrid
fever
,
attend
with
exanthemata
,
erisipelatous
,
and
miliary
eruption
,
which
commonly
prove
fatal
:
but
the
people
in
general
be
healthy
,
even
those
that
take
very
little
exercise
:
a
strong
presumption
in
favour
of
the
climate
!
<EOS>
as
to
medicine
,
I
know
nothing
of
the
practice
of
the
Nice
physician
.
<EOS>
here
be
eleven
in
all
;
but
four
or
five
make
shift
to
live
by
the
profession
.
<EOS>
They
receive
,
by
way
of
fee
,
ten
sol
(
an
english
six
-
pence
)
<EOS>
a
visit
,
and
this
be
but
ill
pay
<EOS>
:
so
you
may
guess
whether
they
be
in
a
condition
to
support
the
dignity
of
physic
;
and
whether
any
man
,
of
a
liberal
education
,
would
bury
himself
at
Nice
on
such
term
.
<EOS>
I
be
acquaint
with
an
italian
physician
settle
at
Villa
Franca
,
a
very
good
sort
of
a
man
,
who
practise
for
a
certain
salary
,
raise
by
annual
contribution
among
the
well
sort
of
people
;
and
an
allowance
from
the
king
,
for
visit
the
sick
belong
to
the
garrison
and
the
gallie
.
<EOS>
the
whole
may
amount
to
near
thirty
pound
.
  
<EOS>
among
the
inconvenience
of
this
climate
,
the
vermin
form
no
inconsiderable
article
.
<EOS>
viper
and
snake
be
find
in
the
mountain
.
<EOS>
Our
garden
swarm
with
lizzards
;
and
there
be
some
few
scorpion
;
but
as
yet
I
have
see
but
one
of
this
specie
.
<EOS>
in
summer
,
notwithstanding
all
the
care
and
precaution
we
can
take
,
we
be
pester
with
incredible
swarm
of
fly
,
flea
,
and
bug
;
but
the
gnat
,
or
couzin
,
be
more
intolerable
than
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
in
the
day
-
time
,
it
be
impossible
to
keep
the
fly
out
of
your
mouth
,
nostril
,
eye
,
and
ear
.
<EOS>
They
croud
into
your
milk
,
tea
,
chocolate
,
soup
,
wine
,
and
water
:
they
soil
your
sugar
,
contaminate
your
victual
,
and
devour
your
fruit
;
they
cover
and
defile
your
furniture
,
floor
,
cieling
,
and
indeed
your
whole
body
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
candle
be
light
,
the
couzin
begin
to
buz
about
your
ear
in
myriad
,
and
torment
you
with
their
sting
,
so
that
you
have
no
rest
nor
respite
 
'
till
you
get
into
bed
,
where
you
be
secure
by
your
mosquito
-
net
.
<EOS>
this
inclosure
be
very
disagreeable
in
hot
weather
;
and
very
inconvenient
to
those
,
who
,
like
me
,
be
subject
to
a
cough
and
spitting
.
<EOS>
It
be
moreover
ineffectual
;
for
some
of
those
curse
insect
insinuate
themselves
within
it
,
almost
every
night
;
and
half
a
dozen
of
them
be
sufficient
to
disturb
you
 
'
till
morning
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
plague
that
continue
all
the
year
;
but
in
summer
it
be
intolerable
.
<EOS>
during
this
season
,
likewise
,
the
moth
be
so
mischievous
,
that
it
require
the
utmost
care
to
preserve
woollen
cloth
from
be
destroy
.
<EOS>
from
the
month
of
May
,
 
'
till
the
beginning
of
October
,
the
heat
be
so
violent
,
that
you
can
not
stir
abroad
after
six
in
the
morning
 
'
till
eight
at
night
,
so
that
you
be
entirely
deprive
of
the
benefit
of
exercise
:
<EOS>
there
be
no
shaded
walk
in
,
or
near
the
town
;
and
there
be
neither
coach
nor
chaise
to
hire
,
unless
you
travel
post
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
there
be
no
road
fit
for
any
wheel
carriage
,
but
the
common
highway
to
the
Var
,
in
which
you
be
scorch
by
the
reflexion
of
the
sun
from
the
sand
and
stone
,
and
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
half
stifle
with
dust
.
<EOS>
if
you
ride
out
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
,
you
will
have
the
disadvantage
of
return
in
the
dark
.
  
<EOS>
among
the
demerit
of
Nice
,
I
must
also
mention
the
water
which
be
use
in
the
city
.
<EOS>
It
be
draw
from
well
;
and
for
the
most
part
so
hard
,
that
it
curdle
with
soap
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
fountain
and
stream
in
the
neighbourhood
,
that
afford
excellent
water
,
which
,
at
no
great
charge
,
may
be
convey
into
the
town
,
so
as
to
form
conduit
in
all
the
public
street
:
but
the
inhabitant
be
either
destitute
of
public
spirit
,
or
can
not
afford
the
expense
.
<EOS>
[
General
Paterson
deliver
a
plan
to
the
King
of
Sardinia
for
supply
Nice
with
excellent
water
for
so
small
an
expence
as
one
livre
a
house
per
annum
;
but
the
inhabitant
remonstrate
against
it
as
an
intolerable
imposition
.
]
<EOS>
I
have
a
draw
-
well
in
my
porch
,
and
another
in
my
garden
,
which
supply
tolerable
water
for
culinary
use
;
but
what
we
drink
,
be
fetch
from
a
well
belong
to
a
convent
of
Dominicans
in
this
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
Our
linnen
be
wash
in
the
river
Paglion
;
and
when
that
be
dry
,
in
the
brook
call
Limpia
,
which
run
into
the
harbour
.
  
<EOS>
in
mention
the
water
of
this
neighbourhood
,
I
ought
not
to
omit
the
bath
of
Rocabiliare
,
a
small
town
among
the
mountain
,
about
five
and
twenty
mile
from
Nice
.
<EOS>
there
be
three
source
,
each
warm
than
the
other
;
the
warm
be
nearly
equal
to
the
heat
of
the
king
's
bath
at
Bath
in
Somersetshire
,
as
far
as
I
can
judge
from
information
.
<EOS>
I
have
peruse
a
latin
manuscript
,
which
treat
of
these
bath
at
Rocabiliare
,
write
by
the
duke
of
Savoy
's
first
physician
about
sixty
year
ago
.
<EOS>
He
talk
much
of
the
sulphur
and
the
nitre
which
they
contain
;
but
I
apprehend
their
efficacy
be
owe
to
the
same
volatile
vitriolic
principle
,
which
characterise
the
water
at
Bath
.
<EOS>
They
be
attenuate
and
deobstruent
,
consequently
of
service
in
disorder
arise
from
a
languid
circulation
,
a
viscidity
of
the
juice
,
a
lax
fibre
,
and
obstruct
viscera
.
<EOS>
the
road
from
hence
to
Rocabiliare
be
in
some
part
very
dangerous
,
lie
along
the
brink
of
precipice
,
impassable
to
any
other
carriage
but
a
mule
.
<EOS>
the
town
itself
afford
bad
lodging
and
accommodation
,
and
little
or
no
society
.
<EOS>
the
water
be
at
the
distance
of
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
town
:
there
be
no
bath
nor
shelter
,
nor
any
sort
of
convenience
for
those
that
drink
them
;
and
the
good
part
of
their
efficacy
be
lose
,
unless
they
be
drink
at
the
fountain
-
head
.
<EOS>
if
these
objection
be
in
some
measure
remove
,
I
would
advise
valetudinarian
,
who
come
hither
for
the
benefit
of
this
climate
,
to
pass
the
heat
of
summer
at
Rocabiliare
,
which
be
situate
among
mountain
,
enjoy
a
cool
temperate
air
all
the
summer
.
<EOS>
this
would
be
a
salutary
respite
from
the
salt
air
of
Nice
,
to
those
who
labour
under
scorbutical
complaint
;
and
they
would
return
with
fresh
vigour
and
spirit
,
to
pass
the
winter
in
this
place
,
where
no
severity
of
weather
be
know
.
<EOS>
last
June
,
when
I
find
myself
so
ill
at
my
cassine
,
I
have
determine
to
go
to
Rocabiliare
,
and
even
to
erect
a
hut
at
the
spring
,
for
my
own
convenience
.
<EOS>
a
gentleman
of
Nice
undertake
to
procure
me
a
tolerable
lodging
in
the
house
of
the
cure
,
who
be
his
relation
.
<EOS>
He
assure
me
<EOS>
,
there
be
no
want
of
fresh
butter
,
good
poultry
,
excellent
veal
,
and
delicate
trout
;
and
that
the
article
of
living
may
be
have
at
Rocabiliare
for
half
the
price
we
pay
at
Nice
:
but
find
myself
grow
better
immediately
on
my
return
from
the
cassine
to
my
own
house
,
I
would
not
put
myself
to
the
trouble
and
expence
of
a
further
removal
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
now
communicate
all
the
particular
relate
to
Nice
,
that
be
worth
know
;
and
perhaps
many
more
than
you
desire
to
know
:
<EOS>
but
,
in
such
case
,
I
would
rather
be
think
prolix
and
unentertaining
,
than
deficient
in
that
regard
and
attention
with
which
I
be
very
sincerely

NICE

<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
deference
to
your
opinion
,
reinforce
by
my
own
inclination
,
and
the
repeat
advice
of
other
friend
,
that
I
resolve
upon
my
late
excursion
to
Italy
.
<EOS>
I
could
plainly
perceive
from
the
anxious
solicitude
,
and
press
exhortation
contain
in
all
the
letter
I
have
lately
receive
from
my
correspondent
in
Britain
,
that
you
have
all
despair
of
my
recovery
.
<EOS>
You
advise
me
to
make
a
pilgrimage
among
the
Alps
,
and
the
advice
be
good
.
<EOS>
in
scramble
among
those
mountain
,
I
should
have
benefit
by
the
exercise
,
and
at
the
same
time
have
breathe
a
cool
,
pure
,
salubrious
air
,
which
,
in
all
probability
,
would
have
expel
the
slow
fever
arise
in
a
great
measure
from
the
heat
of
this
climate
.
<EOS>
but
,
I
want
a
companion
and
fellow
traveller
,
whose
conversation
and
society
could
alleviate
the
horror
of
solitude
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
be
not
strong
enough
to
encounter
the
want
of
convenience
,
and
even
of
necessary
to
which
I
must
have
be
expose
in
the
course
of
such
an
expedition
.
<EOS>
My
worthy
friend
Dr
A
  
earnestly
intreate
me
to
try
the
effect
of
a
sea
-
voyage
,
which
you
know
have
be
find
of
wonderful
efficacy
in
consumptive
case
.
<EOS>
after
some
deliberation
,
I
resolve
upon
the
scheme
,
which
I
have
now
happily
execute
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
most
eager
curiosity
to
see
the
antiquity
of
Florence
and
Rome
:
I
long
impatiently
to
view
those
wonderful
edifice
,
statue
,
and
picture
,
which
I
have
so
often
admire
in
print
and
description
.
<EOS>
I
feel
an
enthusiastic
ardor
to
tread
that
very
classical
ground
which
have
be
the
scene
of
so
many
great
atchievement
;
and
I
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
return
to
England
from
the
very
skirt
of
Italy
,
without
have
penetrate
to
the
capital
of
that
renowned
country
.
<EOS>
with
regard
to
my
health
,
I
know
I
could
manage
matter
so
as
to
enjoy
all
the
benefit
that
could
be
expect
from
the
united
energy
of
a
voyage
by
sea
,
a
journey
by
land
,
and
a
change
of
climate
.
  
<EOS>
Rome
be
betwixt
four
and
five
hundred
mile
distant
from
Nice
,
and
one
half
of
the
way
I
be
resolve
to
travel
by
water
.
<EOS>
indeed
there
be
no
other
way
of
go
from
hence
to
Genoa
,
unless
you
take
a
mule
,
and
clamber
along
the
mountain
at
the
rate
of
two
mile
an
hour
,
and
at
the
risque
of
break
your
neck
every
minute
.
<EOS>
the
Apennine
mountain
,
which
be
no
other
than
a
continuation
of
the
maritime
Alps
,
form
an
almost
continued
precipice
from
Villefranche
to
Lerici
,
which
be
almost
forty
-
five
mile
on
the
other
side
of
Genoa
;
and
as
they
be
generally
wash
by
the
sea
,
there
be
no
beach
or
shore
,
<EOS>
consequently
the
road
be
carry
along
the
face
of
the
rock
,
except
at
certain
small
interval
,
which
be
occupy
by
town
and
village
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
there
be
a
road
for
mule
and
foot
passenger
,
it
may
certainly
be
enlarge
and
improve
so
as
to
render
it
practicable
by
chaise
and
other
wheel
-
carriage
,
and
a
toll
may
be
exact
,
which
in
a
little
time
would
defray
the
expence
:
for
certainly
no
person
who
travel
to
Italy
,
from
England
,
Holland
,
France
,
or
Spain
,
would
make
a
troublesome
circuit
to
pass
the
Alps
by
the
way
of
Savoy
and
Piedmont
,
if
he
could
have
the
convenience
of
go
post
by
the
way
of
Aix
,
Antibes
,
and
Nice
,
along
the
side
of
the
Mediterranean
,
and
through
the
Riviera
of
Genoa
,
which
from
the
sea
afford
the
most
agreeable
and
amazing
prospect
I
ever
beheld
.
<EOS>
what
pity
it
be
,
they
can
not
restore
the
celebrated
Via
Aurelia
,
mention
in
the
Itinerarium
of
Antoninus
,
which
extend
from
Rome
by
the
way
of
Genoa
,
and
through
this
country
as
far
as
arle
upon
the
Rhone
.
<EOS>
It
be
say
to
have
be
make
by
the
emperor
Marcus
Aurelius
;
and
some
of
the
vestige
of
it
be
still
to
be
see
in
Provence
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
the
nobility
of
Genoa
,
who
be
all
merchant
,
from
a
low
,
selfish
,
and
absurd
policy
,
take
all
method
to
keep
their
subject
of
the
Riviera
in
poverty
and
dependence
.
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
they
carefully
avoid
all
step
towards
render
that
country
accessible
by
land
;
and
at
the
same
time
discourage
their
trade
by
sea
,
lest
it
should
interfere
with
the
commerce
of
their
capital
,
in
which
they
themselves
be
personally
concerned
.
  
<EOS>
those
who
either
will
not
or
can
not
bear
the
sea
,
and
be
equally
averse
to
riding
,
may
be
carry
in
a
common
chair
,
provide
with
a
foot
-
board
,
on
man
's
shoulder
:
this
be
the
way
of
travel
practise
by
the
lady
of
Nice
,
in
cross
the
mountain
to
Turin
;
but
it
be
very
tedious
and
expensive
,
as
the
man
must
be
often
relieve
.
  
<EOS>
the
most
agreeable
carriage
from
here
to
Genoa
,
be
a
feluca
,
or
open
boat
,
row
by
ten
or
twelve
stout
mariner
.
<EOS>
though
none
of
these
boat
belong
to
Nice
,
they
be
to
be
find
every
day
in
our
harbour
,
wait
for
a
fare
to
Genoa
;
and
they
be
see
pass
and
repasse
continually
,
with
merchandize
or
passenger
,
between
Marseilles
,
Antibes
,
and
the
genoese
territory
.
<EOS>
a
feluca
be
large
enough
to
take
in
a
post
-
chaise
;
and
there
be
a
tilt
over
the
stern
sheet
,
where
the
passenger
sit
,
to
protect
them
from
the
rain
:
between
the
seat
one
person
may
lie
commodiously
upon
a
mattress
,
which
be
commonly
supply
by
the
patron
.
<EOS>
a
man
in
good
health
may
put
up
with
any
thing
;
but
I
would
advise
every
valetudinarian
who
travel
this
way
,
to
provide
his
own
chaise
,
mattrass
,
and
bedlinnen
,
otherwise
he
will
pass
his
time
very
uncomfortably
.
<EOS>
if
you
go
as
a
simple
passenger
in
a
feluca
,
you
pay
about
a
loui'dore
for
your
place
,
and
you
must
be
intirely
under
the
direction
of
the
patron
,
who
,
while
he
can
bear
the
sea
,
will
prosecute
his
voyage
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
,
and
expose
you
to
many
other
inconveniencie
:
but
for
eight
zequine
,
or
four
loui'dore
,
you
can
have
a
whole
feluca
to
yourself
,
from
Nice
to
Genoa
,
and
the
master
shall
be
oblige
to
put
a
-
shore
every
evening
.
<EOS>
if
you
would
have
it
still
more
at
your
command
,
you
may
hire
it
at
so
much
per
day
,
and
in
that
case
,
go
on
shore
as
often
,
and
stay
as
long
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
method
I
should
take
,
be
I
to
make
the
voyage
again
;
for
I
be
persuade
<EOS>
I
should
find
it
very
near
as
cheap
,
and
much
more
agreeable
than
any
other
.
  
<EOS>
the
distance
between
this
place
and
Genoa
,
when
measure
on
the
carte
,
do
not
exceed
ninety
mile
:
but
the
people
of
the
felucas
insist
upon
its
be
one
hundred
and
twenty
.
<EOS>
if
they
creep
along
shore
round
the
bottom
of
all
the
bay
,
this
computation
may
be
true
:
but
,
except
when
the
sea
be
rough
,
they
stretch
directly
from
one
head
-
land
to
another
,
and
even
when
the
wind
be
contrary
,
provide
the
gale
be
not
fresh
,
they
perform
the
voyage
in
two
day
and
a
half
,
by
dint
of
rowing
:
when
the
wind
be
favourable
,
they
will
sail
it
easily
in
fourteen
hour
.
  
<EOS>
a
man
who
have
nothing
but
expedition
in
view
,
may
go
with
the
courier
,
who
have
always
a
light
boat
well
man
,
and
will
be
glad
to
accommodate
a
traveller
for
a
reasonable
gratification
.
<EOS>
I
know
an
english
gentleman
who
always
travel
with
the
courier
in
Italy
,
both
by
sea
and
land
.
<EOS>
in
post
by
land
,
he
be
always
sure
of
have
part
of
a
good
calash
,
and
the
good
horse
that
can
be
find
;
and
as
the
expence
of
both
be
defray
by
the
public
,
it
cost
him
nothing
but
a
present
to
his
companion
,
which
do
not
amount
to
one
fourth
part
of
the
expence
he
would
incur
by
travel
alone
.
<EOS>
these
opportunity
may
be
have
every
week
in
all
the
town
of
Italy
.
  
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
hire
a
gondola
from
hence
to
Genoa
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
boat
small
than
a
feluca
,
row
by
four
man
,
and
steer
by
the
patron
;
but
the
price
be
nine
zequine
,
rather
more
than
I
should
have
pay
for
a
feluca
of
ten
oar
.
<EOS>
I
be
assure
that
be
very
light
,
it
would
make
great
way
;
and
the
master
be
particularly
recommend
to
me
,
as
an
honest
man
and
an
able
mariner
.
<EOS>
I
be
accompany
in
this
voyage
by
my
wife
and
Miss
C
 
,
together
with
one
<EOS>
Mr
R
 
,
a
native
of
Nice
,
whom
I
treat
with
the
jaunt
,
in
hope
that
as
he
be
acquaint
with
the
custom
of
the
country
,
and
the
different
way
of
travel
in
it
,
he
would
save
us
much
trouble
,
and
some
expence
:
<EOS>
but
I
be
much
disappointed
.
<EOS>
some
person
at
Nice
offer
to
lay
wager
that
he
would
return
by
himself
from
Italy
;
but
they
be
also
disappointed
.
  
<EOS>
We
embark
in
the
beginning
of
September
,
attend
by
one
servant
.
<EOS>
the
heat
,
which
render
travel
dangerous
in
Italy
,
begin
to
abate
at
this
season
.
<EOS>
the
weather
be
extremely
agreeable
;
and
if
I
have
postpone
my
voyage
a
little
longer
,
I
foresaw
that
I
should
not
be
able
to
return
before
winter
:
in
which
case
I
may
have
find
the
sea
too
rough
,
and
the
weather
too
cold
for
a
voyage
of
one
hundred
and
thirty
-
five
mile
in
an
open
boat
.
  
<EOS>
have
therefore
provide
myself
with
a
proper
pass
,
sign
and
seal
by
our
consul
,
as
well
as
with
letter
of
recommendation
from
him
to
the
english
consul
at
Genoa
and
Leghorn
,
a
precaution
which
I
would
advise
all
traveller
to
take
,
in
case
of
meeting
with
accident
on
the
road
,
we
go
on
board
about
ten
in
the
morning
,
stop
about
half
an
hour
at
a
friend
's
country
-
house
in
the
bay
of
St
Hospice
,
and
about
noon
enter
the
harbour
of
Monaco
,
where
the
patron
be
oblige
to
pay
toll
,
accord
to
the
regulation
which
I
have
explain
in
a
former
letter
.
<EOS>
this
small
town
,
contain
about
eight
or
nine
hundred
soul
,
besides
the
garrison
,
be
build
on
a
rock
which
project
into
the
sea
,
and
make
a
very
romantic
appearance
.
<EOS>
the
prince
's
palace
stand
in
the
most
conspicuous
part
,
with
a
walk
of
tree
before
it
.
<EOS>
the
apartment
be
elegantly
furnish
,
and
adorn
with
some
good
picture
.
<EOS>
the
fortification
be
in
good
repair
,
and
the
place
be
garrison
by
two
french
battalion
.
<EOS>
the
present
prince
of
Monaco
be
a
Frenchman
,
son
of
the
duke
Matignon
who
marry
the
heiress
of
Monaco
,
whose
name
be
Grimaldi
.
<EOS>
the
harbour
be
well
sheltered
from
the
wind
;
but
have
not
water
sufficient
to
admit
vessel
of
any
great
burthen
.
<EOS>
towards
the
north
,
the
king
of
Sardinia
's
territory
extend
to
within
a
mile
of
the
gate
;
but
the
prince
of
Monaco
can
go
upon
his
own
ground
along
shore
about
five
or
six
mile
to
the
eastward
,
as
far
as
Menton
,
another
small
town
,
which
also
belong
to
him
,
and
be
situate
on
the
seaside
.
<EOS>
His
revenue
be
compute
at
a
million
of
french
livre
,
amount
to
something
more
than
forty
thousand
pound
sterling
:
but
,
the
principality
of
Monaco
,
consist
of
three
small
town
,
and
an
inconsiderable
tract
of
barren
rock
,
be
not
worth
above
seven
thousand
a
year
;
the
rest
arise
from
his
french
estate
.
<EOS>
this
consist
partly
of
the
dutchy
of
Matignon
,
and
partly
of
the
dutchy
of
Valentinois
,
which
last
be
give
to
the
ancestor
of
this
prince
of
Monaco
,
in
the
year
1640
,
by
the
french
king
,
to
make
up
the
loss
of
some
land
in
the
kingdom
of
Naples
,
which
be
confiscate
when
he
expel
the
spanish
garrison
from
Monaco
,
and
throw
himself
into
the
arm
of
France
:
so
that
he
be
duke
of
Valentinois
as
well
as
of
Matignon
,
in
that
kingdom
.
<EOS>
He
live
almost
constantly
in
France
;
and
have
take
the
name
and
arm
of
Grimaldi
.
  
<EOS>
the
genoese
territory
begin
at
Ventimiglia
,
another
town
lie
on
the
coast
,
at
the
distance
of
twenty
mile
from
Nice
,
a
circumstance
from
which
it
borrow
the
name
.
<EOS>
have
pass
the
town
of
Monaco
,
Menton
,
Ventimiglia
,
and
several
other
place
of
less
consequence
that
lie
along
this
coast
,
we
turn
the
point
of
St
Martin
with
a
favourable
breeze
,
and
may
have
proceed
twenty
mile
further
before
night
:
but
the
woman
begin
to
be
sick
,
as
well
as
afraid
at
the
roughness
of
the
water
;
<EOS>
Mr
R
  
be
so
discompose
,
that
he
privately
desire
the
patron
to
put
ashore
at
St
Remo
,
on
pretence
that
we
should
not
find
a
tolerable
auberge
in
any
other
place
between
this
and
Noli
,
which
be
at
the
distance
of
forty
mile
.
<EOS>
We
accordingly
land
,
and
be
conduct
to
the
poste
,
which
our
gondeliere
assure
us
be
the
good
auberge
in
the
whole
Riviera
of
Genoa
.
<EOS>
We
ascend
by
a
dark
,
narrow
,
steep
stair
,
into
a
kind
of
public
room
,
with
a
long
table
and
bench
,
so
dirty
and
miserable
,
that
it
would
disgrace
the
bad
hedge
ale
-
house
in
England
.
<EOS>
not
a
soul
appear
to
receive
us
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
ceremony
one
must
not
expect
to
meet
with
in
France
;
far
less
in
Italy
.
<EOS>
Our
patron
go
into
the
kitchen
,
ask
a
servant
if
the
company
could
have
lodge
in
the
house
;
and
be
answer
,
"
he
could
not
tell
:
the
patron
be
not
at
home
.
"
<EOS>
when
he
desire
to
know
where
the
patron
be
,
the
other
answer
,
"
he
be
go
to
take
the
air
.
"
<EOS>
E
andato
a
passeggiare
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
we
be
oblige
to
sit
in
the
common
room
among
waterman
and
muleteer
.
<EOS>
at
length
the
landlord
arrive
,
and
give
us
to
understand
,
that
he
could
accommodate
us
with
chamber
.
<EOS>
in
that
where
I
lay
,
there
be
just
room
for
two
bed
,
without
curtain
or
bedstead
,
an
old
rotten
table
cover
with
dry
fig
,
and
a
couple
of
crazy
chair
.
<EOS>
the
wall
have
be
once
white
-
washed
:
but
be
now
hang
with
cobwebs
,
and
speckle
with
dirt
of
all
sort
;
and
I
believe
the
brick
-
floor
have
not
be
sweep
for
half
a
century
.
<EOS>
We
sup
in
an
outward
room
suitable
in
all
respect
to
the
chamber
,
and
fare
villainously
.
<EOS>
the
provision
be
very
ill
-
dressed
,
and
serve
up
in
the
most
slovenly
manner
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
expect
cleanliness
or
conveniency
of
any
kind
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
for
this
accommodation
I
pay
as
much
as
if
I
have
be
elegantly
entertain
in
the
good
auberge
of
France
or
Italy

next
day
,
the
wind
be
so
high
that
we
could
not
prosecute
our
voyage
,
so
that
we
be
oblige
to
pass
other
four
and
twenty
hour
in
this
comfortable
situation
.
<EOS>
luckily
Mr
R
  
find
two
acquaintance
in
the
place
;
one
a
franciscan
monk
,
a
jolly
fellow
;
and
the
other
a
maestro
di
capella
,
who
send
a
spinnet
to
the
inn
,
and
entertain
us
agreeably
with
his
voice
and
performance
,
in
both
of
which
accomplishment
he
excel
.
<EOS>
the
padre
be
very
good
humoured
,
and
favour
us
with
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
a
friend
of
his
,
a
professor
in
the
university
of
Pisa
.
<EOS>
You
would
laugh
to
see
the
hyperbolical
term
in
which
he
mention
your
humble
servant
;
but
Italy
be
the
native
country
of
hyperbole
.
  
<EOS>
St
Remo
be
a
pretty
considerable
town
,
well
-
build
upon
the
declivity
of
a
gently
rise
hill
,
and
have
a
harbour
capable
of
receive
small
vessel
,
a
good
number
of
which
be
build
upon
the
beach
:
but
ship
of
any
burden
be
oblige
to
anchor
in
the
bay
,
which
be
far
from
be
secure
.
<EOS>
the
people
of
St
Remo
form
a
small
republic
,
which
be
subject
to
Genoa
.
  
<EOS>
They
enjoy
particular
privilege
,
till
the
year
1753
,
when
in
consequence
of
a
new
gabelle
upon
salt
,
they
revolt
:
but
this
effort
in
behalf
of
liberty
do
not
succeed
.
<EOS>
They
be
soon
reduce
by
the
Genoese
,
who
deprive
them
of
all
their
privilege
,
and
build
a
fort
by
the
sea
-
side
,
which
serve
the
double
purpose
of
defend
the
harbour
and
over
-
awe
the
town
.
<EOS>
the
garrison
at
present
do
not
exceed
two
hundred
man
.
<EOS>
the
inhabitant
be
say
to
have
lately
send
a
deputation
to
Ratisbon
,
to
crave
the
protection
of
the
diet
of
the
empire
.
<EOS>
there
be
very
little
plain
ground
in
this
neighbourhood
;
but
the
hill
be
cover
with
orange
,
lemon
,
pomegranate
,
and
olive
,
which
produce
a
considerable
traffic
in
fine
fruit
and
excellent
oil
.
<EOS>
the
woman
of
St
Remo
be
much
more
handsome
and
better
temper
than
those
of
Provence
.
<EOS>
They
have
in
general
good
eye
,
with
open
ingenuous
countenance
.
<EOS>
Their
dress
,
though
remarkable
,
I
can
not
describe
:
but
upon
the
whole
,
they
put
me
in
mind
of
some
portrait
I
have
see
,
represent
the
female
of
Georgia
and
Mingrelia
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
third
day
,
the
wind
be
abate
,
though
still
unfavourable
,
we
reimbarke
and
row
along
shore
,
pass
by
Porto
-
mauricio
,
and
Oneglia
;
then
turn
the
promontory
call
Capo
di
Melle
,
we
proceed
by
Albenga
,
Finale
,
and
many
other
place
of
inferior
note
.
<EOS>
Portomauricio
be
seat
on
a
rock
wash
by
the
sea
,
but
indifferently
fortify
,
with
an
inconsiderable
harbour
,
which
none
but
very
small
vessel
can
enter
.
<EOS>
about
two
mile
to
the
eastward
be
Oneglia
,
a
small
town
with
fortification
,
lie
along
the
open
beach
,
and
belong
to
the
king
of
Sardinia
.
<EOS>
this
small
territory
abound
with
olive
-
tree
,
which
produce
a
considerable
quantity
of
oil
,
count
the
good
of
the
whole
Riviera
.
<EOS>
Albenga
be
a
small
town
,
the
see
of
a
bishop
,
suffragan
to
the
archbishop
of
Genoa
.
<EOS>
It
lie
upon
the
sea
,
and
the
country
produce
a
great
quantity
of
hemp
.
<EOS>
finale
be
the
capital
of
a
marquisate
belong
to
the
Genoese
,
which
have
be
the
source
of
much
trouble
to
the
republic
;
and
indeed
be
the
sole
cause
of
their
rupture
with
the
king
of
Sardinia
and
the
house
of
Austria
in
the
year
1745
.
<EOS>
the
town
be
pretty
well
build
;
but
the
harbour
be
shallow
,
open
,
and
unsafe
;
nevertheless
,
they
build
a
good
number
of
tartan
and
other
vessel
on
the
beach
and
the
neighbour
country
abound
with
oil
and
fruit
,
particularly
with
those
excellent
apple
call
pomi
carli
,
which
I
have
mention
in
a
former
letter
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
evening
we
reach
the
Capo
di
Noli
,
count
very
dangerous
in
blow
weather
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
high
perpendicular
rock
or
mountain
wash
by
the
sea
,
which
have
eat
into
it
in
diver
place
,
so
as
to
form
a
great
number
of
cavern
.
<EOS>
It
extend
about
a
couple
of
mile
,
and
in
some
part
be
indent
into
little
creek
or
bay
,
where
there
be
a
narrow
margin
of
sandy
beach
between
it
and
the
water
.
<EOS>
when
the
wind
be
high
,
no
feluca
will
attempt
to
pass
it
;
even
in
a
moderate
breeze
,
the
wave
dash
against
the
rock
and
cavern
,
which
echo
with
the
sound
,
make
such
an
awful
noise
,
and
at
the
same
time
occasion
such
a
rough
sea
,
as
one
can
not
hear
,
and
see
,
and
feel
,
without
a
secret
horror
.
  
<EOS>
on
this
side
of
the
Cape
,
there
be
a
beautiful
strand
cultivate
like
a
garden
;
the
plantation
extend
to
the
very
top
of
the
hill
,
intersperse
with
village
,
castle
,
church
,
and
villas
.
<EOS>
indeed
the
whole
Riviera
be
ornament
in
the
same
manner
,
except
in
such
place
as
admit
of
no
building
nor
 
cultivation
.
  
<EOS>
have
pass
the
Cape
,
we
follow
the
winding
of
the
coast
,
into
a
small
bay
,
and
arrive
at
the
town
of
Noli
,
where
we
propose
to
pass
the
night
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
surprised
that
we
do
not
go
ashore
sooner
,
in
order
to
take
some
refreshment
;
but
the
truth
be
,
we
have
a
provision
of
ham
,
tongue
,
roast
pullet
,
cheese
,
bread
,
wine
,
and
fruit
,
in
the
feluca
,
where
we
every
day
enjoy
a
slight
repast
about
one
or
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
this
I
mention
as
a
necessary
piece
of
information
to
those
who
may
be
incline
to
follow
the
same
route
.
<EOS>
We
likewise
find
it
convenient
to
lay
in
store
of
l'eau
de
vie
,
or
brandy
,
for
the
use
of
the
rower
,
who
always
expect
to
share
your
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
on
a
meagre
day
,
however
,
those
ragamuffin
will
rather
die
of
hunger
than
suffer
the
least
morsel
of
flesh
-
meat
to
enter
their
mouth
.
<EOS>
I
have
frequently
try
the
experiment
,
by
press
them
to
eat
something
gras
,
on
a
Friday
or
Saturday
:
but
they
always
decline
it
with
mark
of
abhorrence
,
crying
,
Dio
me
<EOS>
ne
libere
!
<EOS>
God
deliver
me
from
it
!
<EOS>
or
some
other
word
to
that
effect
.
<EOS>
I
moreover
observe
,
that
not
one
of
those
fellow
ever
swear
an
oath
,
or
speak
an
indecent
word
.
<EOS>
They
would
by
no
mean
put
to
sea
,
of
a
morning
,
before
they
have
hear
mass
;
and
when
the
wind
be
unfavourable
,
they
always
set
out
with
a
hymn
to
the
Blessed
Virgin
,
or
St
Elmo
,
keep
time
with
their
oar
as
they
sing
.
<EOS>
I
have
indeed
remark
all
over
this
country
,
that
a
man
who
transgress
the
institution
of
the
church
in
these
small
matter
,
be
much
more
infamous
than
one
who
have
commit
the
most
flagrant
crime
against
nature
and
morality
.
<EOS>
a
murderer
,
adulterer
,
or
s
 
m
 
te
,
will
obtain
easy
absolution
from
the
church
,
and
even
find
favour
with
society
;
but
a
man
who
eat
a
pidgeon
on
a
Saturday
,
without
express
licence
,
be
avoid
and
abhor
,
as
a
monster
of
reprobation
.
<EOS>
I
have
converse
with
several
intelligent
person
on
the
subject
;
and
have
reason
to
believe
,
that
a
delinquent
of
this
sort
be
consider
as
a
luke
-
warm
catholic
,
little
well
than
a
heretic
;
and
of
all
crime
they
look
upon
heresy
as
the
most
damnable
.
  
<EOS>
Noli
be
a
small
republic
of
fisherman
subject
to
Genoa
;
but
very
tenacious
of
their
privilege
.
<EOS>
the
town
stand
on
the
beach
,
tolerably
well
build
,
defend
by
a
castle
situate
on
a
rock
above
it
;
and
the
harbour
be
of
little
consequence
.
<EOS>
the
auberge
be
such
as
make
us
regret
even
the
inn
we
have
leave
at
St
Remo
.
<EOS>
after
a
very
odd
kind
of
supper
,
which
I
can
not
pretend
to
describe
,
we
retire
to
our
repose
:
<EOS>
but
I
have
not
be
in
bed
five
minute
,
when
I
feel
something
crawl
on
different
part
of
my
body
,
and
take
a
light
to
examine
,
perceive
above
a
dozen
large
bug
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
I
have
the
same
kind
of
antipathy
to
these
vermin
,
that
some
person
have
to
a
cat
or
breast
of
veal
.
<EOS>
I
start
up
immediately
,
and
wrap
myself
in
a
great
coat
,
sick
as
I
be
,
lay
down
in
the
outer
room
upon
a
chest
,
where
I
continue
till
morning
.
  
<EOS>
one
would
imagine
that
in
a
mountainous
country
like
this
,
there
should
be
plenty
of
goat
;
and
indeed
,
we
see
many
flock
of
them
feed
among
the
rock
,
yet
we
could
not
procure
half
a
pint
of
milk
for
our
tea
,
if
we
have
give
the
weight
of
it
in
gold
.
<EOS>
the
people
here
have
no
idea
of
use
milk
,
and
when
you
ask
them
for
it
,
they
stand
gape
with
a
foolish
face
of
surprise
,
which
be
exceedingly
provoking
.
<EOS>
It
be
amazing
that
instinct
do
not
teach
the
peasant
to
feed
their
child
with
goat
's
milk
,
so
much
more
nourishing
and
agreeable
than
the
wretched
sustenance
on
which
they
live
.
<EOS>
next
day
we
row
by
Vado
and
Savona
,
which
last
be
a
large
town
,
with
a
strong
citadel
,
and
a
harbour
,
which
be
formerly
capable
of
receive
large
ship
:
but
it
fall
a
sacrifice
to
the
jealousy
of
the
Genoese
,
who
have
partly
choake
it
up
,
on
pretence
that
it
should
not
afford
shelter
to
the
ship
of
war
belong
to
those
state
which
may
be
at
enmity
with
the
republic
.
  
<EOS>
then
we
pass
Albifola
,
Sestri
di
Ponente
,
Novi
,
Voltri
,
and
a
great
number
of
village
,
villas
,
and
magnificent
palace
belong
to
the
genoese
nobility
,
which
form
almost
a
continued
chain
of
building
along
the
strand
for
thirty
mile
.
  
<EOS>
about
five
in
the
afternoon
,
we
skirt
the
fine
suburbs
of
St
Pietro
d
'
arena
,
and
arrive
at
Genoa
,
which
make
a
dazzling
appearance
when
view
from
the
sea
,
rise
like
an
amphitheatre
in
a
circular
form
from
the
water
's
edge
,
a
considerable
way
up
the
mountain
,
and
surround
on
the
land
side
by
a
double
wall
,
the
most
exterior
of
which
be
say
to
extend
fifteen
mile
in
circuit
.
<EOS>
the
first
object
that
strike
your
eye
at
a
distance
,
be
a
very
elegant
pharo
,
or
lighthouse
,
build
on
the
projection
of
a
rock
on
the
west
side
of
the
harbour
,
so
very
high
,
that
,
in
a
clear
day
,
you
may
see
it
at
the
distance
of
thirty
mile
.
<EOS>
turn
the
light
-
house
point
,
you
find
yourself
close
to
the
mole
,
which
form
the
harbour
of
Genoa
.
<EOS>
It
be
build
at
a
great
expence
from
each
side
of
the
bay
,
so
as
to
form
in
the
sea
two
long
magnificent
jette
.
<EOS>
at
the
extremity
of
each
be
another
small
lanthorn
.
<EOS>
these
mole
be
both
provide
with
brass
-
cannon
,
and
between
them
be
the
entrance
into
the
harbour
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
still
so
wide
as
to
admit
a
great
sea
,
which
,
when
the
wind
blow
hard
from
south
and
south
-
west
,
be
very
troublesome
to
the
shipping
.
<EOS>
within
the
mole
there
be
a
small
harbour
or
wet
dock
,
call
Darsena
,
for
the
gallie
of
the
republic
.
<EOS>
We
pass
through
a
considerable
number
of
ship
and
vessel
lie
at
anchor
,
and
landing
at
the
water
-
gate
,
repair
to
an
inn
call
La
Croix
de
Malthe
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
harbour
.
<EOS>
here
we
meet
with
such
good
entertainment
as
prepossess
us
in
favour
of
the
interior
part
of
Italy
,
and
contribute
with
other
motive
to
detain
us
some
day
in
this
city
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
detain
you
so
long
,
that
I
believe
you
wish
I
may
proceed
no
farther
;
and
therefore
I
take
my
leave
for
the
present
,
be
very
sincerely
  
yours

<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
without
reason
that
Genoa
be
call
La
superba
.
<EOS>
the
city
itself
be
very
stately
;
and
the
noble
be
very
proud
.
<EOS>
some
few
of
them
may
be
proud
of
their
wealth
:
but
,
in
general
,
their
fortune
be
very
small
.
<EOS>
My
friend
Mr
R
  
assure
me
that
many
genoese
nobleman
have
fortune
of
half
a
million
of
livre
per
annum
:
but
the
truth
be
,
the
whole
revenue
of
the
state
do
not
exceed
this
sum
;
and
the
livre
of
Genoa
be
but
about
nine
pence
sterling
.
<EOS>
there
be
about
half
a
dozen
of
their
noble
who
have
ten
thousand
a
year
:
but
the
majority
have
not
above
a
twentieth
part
of
that
sum
.
<EOS>
They
live
with
great
parsimony
in
their
family
;
and
wear
nothing
but
black
in
public
;
so
that
their
expence
be
but
small
.
<EOS>
if
a
genoese
nobleman
give
an
entertainment
once
a
quarter
,
he
be
say
to
live
upon
the
fragment
all
the
rest
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
I
be
tell
that
one
of
them
lately
treat
his
friend
,
and
leave
the
entertainment
to
the
care
of
his
son
,
who
order
a
dish
of
fish
that
cost
a
zechine
,
which
be
equal
to
about
ten
shilling
sterling
.
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
no
sooner
see
it
appear
on
the
table
,
than
unable
to
suppress
his
concern
,
he
burst
into
tear
,
and
exclaim
,
ah
Figliuolo
indegno
!
<EOS>
Siamo
in
Rovina
!
<EOS>
Siamo
in
precipizio
!
<EOS>
ah
,
Prodigal
!
<EOS>
ruin
!
<EOS>
undone
!
  
<EOS>
I
think
the
pride
or
ostentation
of
the
Italians
in
general
take
a
more
laudable
turn
than
that
of
other
nation
.
<EOS>
a
Frenchman
lay
out
his
whole
revenue
upon
tawdry
suit
of
cloath
,
or
in
furnish
a
magnificent
repa
of
fifty
or
a
hundred
dish
,
one
half
of
which
be
not
eatable
nor
intend
to
be
eat
.
<EOS>
His
wardrobe
go
to
the
fripier
;
his
dish
to
the
dog
,
and
himself
to
the
devil
,
and
after
his
decease
no
vestige
of
him
remain
.
<EOS>
a
Genoese
,
on
the
other
hand
,
keep
himself
and
his
family
at
short
allowance
,
that
he
may
save
money
to
build
palace
and
church
,
which
remain
to
after
-
age
<EOS>
so
many
monument
of
his
taste
,
piety
,
and
munificence
;
and
in
the
mean
time
give
employment
and
bread
to
the
poor
and
industrious
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
genoese
noble
who
have
each
five
or
six
elegant
palace
magnificently
furnish
,
either
in
the
city
,
or
in
different
part
of
the
Riviera
.
<EOS>
the
two
street
call
Strada
Balbi
and
Strada
Nuova
,
be
continue
double
range
of
palace
adorn
with
garden
and
fountain
:
but
their
be
paint
on
the
outside
have
,
in
my
opinion
,
a
poor
effect
.
  
<EOS>
the
commerce
of
this
city
be
,
at
present
,
not
very
considerable
;
yet
it
have
the
face
of
business
.
<EOS>
the
street
be
crowd
with
people
;
the
shop
be
well
furnished
;
and
the
market
abound
with
all
sort
of
excellent
provision
.
<EOS>
the
wine
make
in
this
neighbourhood
be
,
however
,
very
indifferent
;
and
all
that
be
consume
must
be
buy
at
the
public
cantine
,
where
it
be
sell
for
the
benefit
of
the
state
.
<EOS>
Their
bread
be
the
white
and
the
good
I
have
taste
any
where
;
and
the
beef
,
which
they
have
from
Piedmont
,
be
juicy
and
delicious
.
<EOS>
the
expence
of
eat
in
Italy
be
nearly
the
same
as
in
France
,
about
three
shilling
a
head
for
every
meal
.
<EOS>
the
state
of
Genoa
be
very
poor
,
and
their
bank
of
St
George
have
receive
such
rude
shock
,
first
from
the
revolt
of
the
Corsicans
,
and
afterwards
from
the
misfortune
of
the
city
,
when
it
be
take
by
the
Austrians
in
the
war
of
1745
,
that
it
still
continue
to
languish
without
any
near
prospect
of
its
credit
be
restore
.
<EOS>
nothing
shew
the
weakness
of
their
state
,
more
than
their
have
recourse
to
the
assistance
of
France
to
put
a
stop
to
the
progress
of
Paoli
in
Corsica
;
for
after
all
that
have
be
say
of
the
gallantry
and
courage
of
Paoli
and
his
islander
<EOS>
,
I
be
very
credibly
inform
that
they
may
be
very
easily
suppress
,
if
the
Genoese
have
either
vigour
in
the
council
or
resolution
in
the
field
.
  
<EOS>
true
it
be
,
they
make
a
noble
effort
in
expel
the
Austrians
who
have
take
possession
of
their
city
;
but
this
effort
be
the
effect
of
oppression
and
despair
,
and
if
I
may
believe
the
insinuation
of
some
politician
in
this
part
of
the
world
,
the
Genoese
would
not
have
succeed
in
that
attempt
,
if
they
have
not
previously
purchase
with
a
large
sum
of
money
the
connivance
of
the
only
person
who
could
defeat
the
enterprize
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
can
scarce
entertain
thought
so
prejudicial
to
the
character
of
human
nature
,
as
to
suppose
a
man
capable
of
sacrifice
to
such
a
consideration
,
the
duty
he
owe
his
prince
,
as
well
as
all
regard
to
the
life
of
his
soldier
,
even
those
who
lie
sick
in
hospital
,
and
who
,
be
drag
forth
,
be
miserably
butcher
by
the
furious
populace
.
<EOS>
there
be
one
more
presumption
of
his
innocence
,
he
still
retain
the
favour
of
his
sovereign
,
who
could
not
well
be
suppose
to
share
in
the
booty
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
mystery
in
politic
which
be
never
dream
of
in
our
philosophy
,
Horatio
!
"
<EOS>
the
possession
of
Genoa
may
have
prove
a
troublesome
bone
of
contention
,
which
it
may
be
convenient
to
lose
by
accident
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
when
the
Austrians
return
after
their
expulsion
,
in
order
to
retake
the
city
,
the
engineer
,
be
question
by
the
general
,
declare
he
would
take
the
place
in
fifteen
day
,
on
pain
of
lose
his
head
;
and
in
four
day
after
this
declaration
the
Austrians
retire
.
<EOS>
this
anecdote
I
learn
from
a
worthy
gentleman
of
this
country
,
who
have
it
from
the
engineer
's
own
mouth
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
the
will
of
heaven
.
<EOS>
You
see
how
favourably
,
providence
have
interpose
in
behalf
of
the
reign
empress
of
Russia
,
first
in
remove
her
husband
:
secondly
in
ordain
the
assassination
of
prince
Ivan
,
for
which
the
perpetrator
have
be
so
liberally
reward
;
it
even
seem
determined
to
shorten
the
life
of
her
own
son
,
the
only
survive
rival
from
whom
she
have
any
thing
to
fear
.
  
<EOS>
the
Genoese
have
now
throw
themselves
into
the
arm
of
France
for
protection
:
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
it
would
not
have
be
a
great
mark
of
sagacity
to
cultivate
the
friendship
of
England
,
with
which
they
carry
on
an
advantageous
commerce
.
<EOS>
while
the
English
be
master
of
the
Mediterranean
,
they
will
always
have
it
in
their
power
to
do
incredible
damage
all
along
the
Riviera
,
to
ruin
the
genoese
trade
by
sea
,
and
even
to
annoy
the
capital
;
for
notwithstanding
all
the
pain
they
have
take
to
fortify
the
mole
and
the
city
,
I
be
greatly
deceive
if
it
be
not
still
expose
to
the
danger
,
not
only
of
a
bombardment
,
but
even
of
a
cannonade
.
<EOS>
I
be
even
sanguine
enough
to
think
a
resolute
commander
might
,
with
a
strong
squadron
,
sail
directly
into
the
harbour
,
without
sustain
much
damage
,
notwithstanding
all
the
cannon
of
the
place
,
which
be
say
to
amount
to
near
five
hundred
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
a
cannonade
of
above
four
hundred
piece
of
artillery
,
besides
bomb
and
cohorn
,
maintain
for
many
hour
,
without
do
much
mischief
.
  
<EOS>
during
the
last
siege
of
Genoa
,
the
french
auxiliary
be
oblige
to
wait
at
Monaco
,
until
a
gale
of
wind
have
drive
the
English
squadron
off
the
coast
,
and
then
they
go
along
shore
in
small
vessel
at
the
imminent
risque
of
be
take
by
the
british
cruiser
.
<EOS>
by
land
I
apprehend
their
march
would
be
altogether
impracticable
,
if
the
king
of
Sardinia
have
any
interest
to
oppose
it
.
<EOS>
He
may
either
guard
the
pass
,
or
break
up
the
road
in
twenty
different
place
,
so
as
to
render
it
altogether
impassable
.
<EOS>
here
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
observe
,
that
when
Don
Philip
advance
from
Nice
with
his
army
to
Genoa
,
he
be
oblige
to
march
so
close
to
the
shore
,
that
in
above
fifty
different
place
,
the
english
ship
may
have
render
the
road
altogether
impassable
.
<EOS>
the
path
,
which
run
generally
along
the
face
of
a
precipice
wash
by
the
sea
,
be
so
narrow
that
two
man
on
horseback
can
hardly
pass
each
other
;
and
the
road
itself
so
rugged
,
slippery
,
and
dangerous
,
that
the
trooper
be
oblige
to
dismount
,
and
lead
their
horse
one
by
one
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
baron
de
Leutrum
,
who
be
at
the
head
of
a
large
body
of
piedmontese
troop
,
have
it
in
his
power
to
block
up
the
pass
of
the
mountain
,
and
even
to
destroy
this
road
in
such
a
manner
,
that
the
enemy
could
not
possibly
advance
.
<EOS>
why
these
precaution
be
not
take
,
I
do
not
pretend
to
explain
:
neither
can
I
tell
you
wherefore
the
prince
of
Monaco
,
who
be
a
subject
and
partizan
of
France
,
be
indulge
with
a
neutrality
for
his
town
,
which
serve
as
a
refreshing
-
place
,
a
safe
port
,
and
an
intermediate
post
for
the
french
succour
send
from
Marseilles
to
Genoa
.
<EOS>
this
I
will
only
venture
to
affirm
,
that
the
success
and
advantage
of
great
alliance
be
often
sacrifice
to
low
,
partial
,
selfish
,
and
sordid
consideration
.
<EOS>
the
town
of
Monaco
be
command
by
every
heighth
in
its
neighbourhood
;
and
may
be
lay
in
ashe
by
a
bomb
-
ketch
in
four
hour
by

.
  
<EOS>
I
be
fortunate
enough
to
be
recommend
to
a
lady
in
Genoa
,
who
treat
us
with
great
politeness
and
hospitality
.
<EOS>
She
introduce
me
to
an
abbate
,
a
man
of
letter
,
whose
conversation
be
extremely
agreeable
.
<EOS>
He
already
know
me
by
reputation
,
and
offer
to
make
me
known
to
some
of
the
first
person
in
the
republic
,
with
whom
he
live
in
intimacy
.
<EOS>
the
lady
be
one
of
the
most
intelligent
and
best
-
breed
person
I
have
know
in
any
country
.
<EOS>
We
assist
at
her
conversazione
,
which
be
numerous
.
<EOS>
She
press
us
to
pass
the
winter
at
Genoa
;
and
indeed
I
be
almost
persuade
:
but
<EOS>
I
have
attachment
at
Nice
,
from
which
I
could
not
easily
disengage
myself
.
  
<EOS>
the
few
day
we
stave
at
Genoa
be
employ
in
visit
the
most
remarkable
church
and
palace
.
<EOS>
in
some
of
the
church
,
particularly
that
of
the
Annunciata
,
I
find
a
profusion
of
ornament
,
which
have
more
magnificence
than
taste
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
number
of
picture
;
but
very
few
of
them
be
capital
piece
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
much
of
the
ponte
Carignano
,
which
do
not
at
all
answer
my
expectation
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
bridge
that
unite
two
eminence
which
form
the
high
part
of
the
city
,
and
the
house
in
the
bottom
below
do
not
rise
so
high
as
the
springing
of
its
arch
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
at
all
curious
in
its
construction
,
nor
any
way
remarkable
,
except
the
heighth
of
the
pier
from
which
the
arch
be
spring
.
<EOS>
hard
by
the
bridge
there
be
an
elegant
church
,
from
the
top
of
which
you
have
a
very
rich
and
extensive
prospect
of
the
city
,
the
sea
and
the
adjacent
country
,
which
look
like
a
continent
of
grove
and
villas
.
<EOS>
the
only
remarkable
circumstance
about
the
cathedral
,
which
be
gothic
and
gloomy
,
be
the
chapel
where
the
pretended
bone
of
John
the
Baptist
be
deposit
,
and
in
which
thirty
silver
lamp
be
continually
burn
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
curiosity
to
see
the
palace
of
Durazzo
and
Doria
,
but
it
require
more
trouble
to
procure
admission
than
I
be
willing
to
give
myself
:
as
for
the
arsenal
,
and
the
rostrum
of
an
ancient
galley
which
be
find
by
accident
in
drag
the
harbour
,
I
postpone
see
them
till
my
return
.
  
<EOS>
have
here
provide
myself
with
letter
of
credit
for
Florence
and
Rome
,
I
hire
the
same
boat
which
have
bring
us
hither
,
to
carry
us
forward
to
Lerici
,
which
be
a
small
town
<EOS>
about
half
way
between
Genoa
and
Leghorn
,
where
traveller
,
who
be
tired
of
the
sea
,
take
post
-
chaise
to
continue
their
route
by
land
to
Pisa
and
Florence
.
<EOS>
I
pay
three
loui'dore
for
this
voyage
of
about
fifty
mile
;
though
I
may
have
have
a
feluca
for
less
money
.
<EOS>
when
you
land
on
the
wharf
at
Genoa
,
you
be
ply
by
the
feluca
man
just
as
you
be
ply
by
the
waterman
at
Hungerford

stair
in
London

<EOS>
They

always
ready
to
set
off
at
a
minute
's
warning
for
Lerici

Leghorn

Nice
,
Antibes

Marseilles

every

<EOS>
the
wind
be
still
unfavourable
,
though
the
weather
be
delightful

we
row
along
shore
,
pass
by
several
pretty
town

village

and
a
vast
number
of
cassine
,
or
little
white
house

scatter
among
wood

olive

cover

these
be
the
habitation

the
velvet

<EOS>
turn
Capo

enter
a
bay

where
stand
the

Porto
Fino

Lavagna

and
Sestri

at
which
last
we
take
up
our
night

lodging

<EOS>
the
house
be
tolerable

and
we
have
no
great
reason
to
complain
of
the
bed

the
weather
be
hot
,
there
be
a
very
offensive
smell

which
proceed
from
some
skin
of
beast
new

that
be
spread
to
dry
on
an
outhouse
in
the
yard

<EOS>
Our
landlord
be
a
butcher
,
and
have
very
much
the
look
of
an
assassin

His
wife
be
a
great
masculine
virago

who
have
all
the
air
of
have
frequent
the
slaughter

<EOS>
instead
of
be
welcome
with
look
of
complaisance
,
we
be
admit
with
a
sort
of
gloomy
condescension
,
which
seem
to
say
,
"
We
do
not
much
like
your
company

however

you
shall
have
a
night

of
the
patron
of

who

<EOS>
"
in
short
,
we
have
a
very
bad
supper
,
miserably
dress
,
pass
a
very
disagreeable
night
,
and
pay
a
very
extravagant
bill
in
the
morning

I
be
very
glad

get
out

Sestri
di
Levante
be
a
little
town
pleasantly
situate
on

have
not

conveniency
of

the

take
here

<EOS>
this
be
likewise
the
market
for
their

and
the
paste
call
macaroni

of
which
they
make
a
good
quantity

<EOS>
next
day

we
skirt
a
very
barren
coast
,
consist
of
almost
perpendicular
rock

on
the
face
of
which
,
however

we
see
many
peasant

hang
terrace
for

make
by
dint
of
incredible
labour

<EOS>
in
the
afternoon

we
enter
by
the
Porti

Venere
into
the
bay

gulf
of
Spetia
or
Spezza

which
be
the

island
Palmaria

capacious
enough
to
contain
all

the
entrance
on
one
side
be
defend
by
a
small
fort

above
the
town

very
poor
place

on

<EOS>
the
whole
bay

plantation

olive

delightful

be
an
admirable
station
for
a
british
squadron
,
as
it
lie
so
near
Genoa
and
Leghorn
;
and
have
a
double
entrance
,
by

of
which
the
cruiser
could
sail
in

out
continually
,
which
way
soever
the
wind
may
chance
to
sit

<EOS>
I
be
sure
the
fortification
would
give
very
little
disturbance
.
  
<EOS>
at
the

house
in
Lerici
,
the
accommodation
be
intolerable
.
<EOS>
We
be
almost
poison
at
supper
.
<EOS>
I
find
the
place
where
I
be
to
lie
so
close
and
confine
,
that
I
could
not
breathe
in
it
,
and
therefore
lie
all
night
in
an
outward
room
upon
four
chair
,
with
a
leather
portmanteau
for
my
pillow
.
<EOS>
for
this
entertainment
I
pay
very
near
a
loui'dore
.
<EOS>
such
bad
accommodation
be
the
less
excusable
,
as
the
fellow
have
a
great
deal
of
business
,
this
be
a
great
thoroughfare
for
traveller
go
into
Italy

<EOS>
I
may
have
save
some
money
by
prosecute
my

to
Leghorn
:
but
,
by
this
time
,
we
be
all
heartily
tired
of
the
water

the
business
then
be
to
travel
by
land
to
Florence

by
the
way
of
Pisa
,
which
be
seven
post
distant
from
Lerici
.
<EOS>
those
who
have
not
their
own
carriage
must
either
hire
chaise
to
perform
the
whole
journey
,
or
travel
by
way
of
cambiatura
,
which
be
that
of
change
the

the

England

<EOS>
for

eight
paoli

the

expect
two
paoli
for

so
that
every
eight
mile
cost
about
five
shilling
,
and
four
only
,
if
you
travel
in

own

you
pay
no
more

at

about

DEAR
SIR
,
 
Pisa
be
a
fine
old
city
that
strike
you
with
the
same
veneration
you
would
feel
at
sight
of
an
antient
temple
which
bear
the
mark
of
decay
,
without
be
absolutely
dilapidated
.
<EOS>
the
house
be
well
build
,
the
street
open
,
straight
,
and
well
pave
;
the
shop
well
furnish
;
and
the
market
well
supply
:
there
be
some
elegant
palace
,
design
by
great
master
.
<EOS>
the
church
be
build
with
taste
,
and
tolerably
ornament
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
beautiful
wharf
of
freestone
on
each
side
of
the
river
Arno
,
which
run
through
the
city
,
and
three
bridge
throw
over
it
,
of
which
that
in
the
middle
be
of
marble
,
a
pretty
piece
of
architecture
:
but
the
number
of
inhabitant
be
very
inconsiderable
;
and
this
very
circumstance
give
it
an
air
of
majestic
solitude
,
which
be
far
from
be
unpleasant
to
a
man
of
a
contemplative
turn
of
mind
.
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
can
not
bear
the
tumult
of
a
populous
commercial
city
;
and
the
solitude
that
reign
in
Pisa
would
with
me
be
a
strong
motive
to
choose
it
as
a
place
of
residence
.
<EOS>
not
that
this
would
be
the
only
inducement
for
live
at
Pisa
.
<EOS>
here
be
some
good
company
,
and
even
a
few
man
of
taste
and
learning
.
<EOS>
the
people
in
general
be
count
sociable
and
polite
;
and
there
be
great
plenty
of
provision
,
at
a
very
reasonable
rate
.
<EOS>
at
some
distance
from
the
more
frequented
part
of
the
city
,
a
man
may
hire
a
large
house
for
thirty
crown
a
year
:
but
near
the
center
,
you
can
not
have
good
lodging
,
ready
furnished
,
for
less
than
a
scudo
(
about
five
shilling
)
a
day
.
<EOS>
the
air
in
summer
be
reckon
unwholesome
by
the
exhalation
arise
from
stagnant
water
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
city
,
which
stand
in
the
midst
of
a
fertile
plain
,
low
and
marshy
:
yet
these
marsh
have
be
considerably
drain
,
and
the
air
be
much
meliorate
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
Arno
,
it
be
no
longer
navigate
by
vessel
of
any
burthen
.
<EOS>
the
university
of
Pisa
be
very
much
decayed
;
and
except
the
little
business
occasion
by
the
emperor
's
gallie
,
which
be
build
in
this
town
,
[
this
be
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
no
gallie
have
be
build
here
for
a
great
many
year
,
and
the
dock
be
now
convert
into
stable
for
the
Grand
Duke
's
Horse
Guards
.
]
<EOS>
I
know
of
no
commerce
it
carry
on
:
perhaps
the
inhabitant
live
on
the
produce
of
the
country
,
which
consist
of
corn
,
wine
,
and
cattle
.
<EOS>
They
be
supply
with
excellent
water
for
drinking
,
by
an
aqueduct
consist
of
above
five
thousand
arch
,
begin
by
Cosmo
,
and
finish
by
Ferdinand
I
Grand
-
duke
of
Tuscany
;
it
convey
the
water
from
the
mountain
at
the
distance
of
five
mile
.
<EOS>
this
noble
city
,
formerly
the
capital
of
a
flourishing
and
powerful
republic
,
which
contain
above
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
inhabitant
,
within
its
wall
,
be
now
so
desolate
that
grass
grow
in
the
open
street
;
and
the
number
of
its
people
do
not
exceed
sixteen
thousand
.
  
<EOS>
You
need
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
I
visit
the
Campanile
,
or
hanging
-
tower
,
which
be
a
beautiful
cylinder
of
eight
story
,
<EOS>
each
adorn
with
a
round
of
column
,
rise
one
above
another
.
<EOS>
It
stand
by
the
cathedral
,
and
incline
so
far
on
one
side
from
the
perpendicular
,
that
in
drop
a
plummet
from
the
top
,
which
be
one
hundred
and
eighty
-
eight
foot
high
,
it
fall
sixteen
foot
from
the
base
.
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
should
never
have
dream
that
this
inclination
proceed
from
any
other
cause
,
than
an
accidental
subsidence
of
the
foundation
on
this
side
,
if
some
connoisseur
have
not
take
great
pain
to
prove
it
be
do
on
purpose
by
the
architect
.
<EOS>
any
person
who
have
eye
may
see
that
the
pillar
on
that
side
be
considerably
sink
;
and
this
be
the
case
with
the
very
threshold
of
the
door
by
which
you
enter
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
have
be
a
very
preposterous
ambition
in
the
architect
,
to
show
how
far
they
could
deviate
from
the
perpendicular
in
this
construction
;
because
in
that
particular
any
common
mason
could
have
rival
them
;
[
all
the
world
know
that
a
building
with
such
inclination
may
be
carry
up
till
a
line
draw
from
the
Centre
of
Gravity
fall
without
the
Circumference
of
the
Base
.
]
<EOS>
and
if
they
really
intend
it
as
a
speciman
of
their
art
,
they
should
have
shorten
the
pilaster
on
that
side
,
so
as
to
exhibit
them
intire
,
without
the
appearance
of
sink
.
<EOS>
these
lean
tower
be
not
unfrequent
in
Italy
;
there
be
one
at
Bologna
,
another
at
Venice
,
a
third
betwixt
Venice
and
Ferrara
,
and
a
fourth
at
Ravenna
;
and
the
inclination
in
all
of
them
have
be
suppose
owe
to
the
foundation
give
way
on
one
side
only
.
  
<EOS>
in

cathedral

large
gothic
pile

Edifice

<EOS>
It

Twelfth
Century
after
the
design
of
a
Greek
Architect
from
Constantinople
,
where
by
that
time
the

much
degenerate

<EOS>

but
,
at

neither

several

stand

<EOS>
It

also
appear
superfluous
to

the

all
these
object
have
be
circumstantially
describe
by
twenty
different
author
of
travel

I
shall
not
trouble
you
with

trite
observation

<EOS>
that
part
of
the
city
which
stand
on

side

make
a
very
elegant
appearance
,
to
which
the

contribute
in

<EOS>
I
lodge
at
the
widow
<EOS>
Vanini
's
,
an
english
house
delightfully
situate
in
this
quarter
.
<EOS>
the
landlady
,
who
be
herself
a
native
of
England
,
we
find
very
obliging
.
<EOS>
the
lodging
-
room
be
comfortable
;
and
the
entertainment
be
good
and
reasonable
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
considerable
number
of
fashionable
people
at
Florence
,
and
many
of
them
in
good
circumstance
.
<EOS>
They
affect
a
gaiety
in
their
dress
,
equipage
,
and
conversation
;
but
stand
very
much
on
their
punctilio
with
stranger
;
and
will
not
,
without
great
reluctance
,
admit
into
their
assembly
any
lady
of
another
country
,
whose
noblesse
be
not
ascertain
by
a
title
.
<EOS>
this
reserve
be
in
some
measure
excusable
among
a
people
who
be
extremely
ignorant
of
foreign
custom
,
and
who
know
that
in
their
own
country
,
every
person
,
even
the
most
insignificant
,
who
have
any
pretension
to
family
,
either
inherit
,
or
assume
the
title
of
principe
,
conte
,
or
marchese
.
  
<EOS>
with
all
their
pride
,
however
,
the
noble
of
Florence
be
humble
enough
to
enter
into
partnership
with
shop
-
keeper
,
and
even
to
sell
wine
by
retail
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
undoubted
fact
,
that
in
every
palace
or
great
house
in
this
city
,
there
be
a
little
window
front
the
street
,
provide
with
an
iron
-
knocker
,
and
over
it
hang
an
empty
flask
,
by
way
of
sign
-
post
.
<EOS>
thither
you
send
your
servant
to
buy
a
bottle
of
wine
.
<EOS>
He
knock
at
the
little
wicket
,
which
be
open
immediately
by
a
domestic
,
who
supply
him
with
what
he
want
,
and
receive
the
money
like
the
waiter
of
any
other
cabaret
.
<EOS>
It
be
pretty
extraordinary
,
that
it
should
not
be
deem
a
disparagement
in
a
nobleman
to
sell
half
a
pound
of
fig
,
or
a
palm
of
ribbon
or
tape
,
or
to
take
money
for
a
flask
of
sour
wine
;
and
yet
be
count
infamous
to
match
his
daughter
in
the
family
of
a
person
who
have
distinguish
himself
in
any
one
of
the
learned
profession
.
  
<EOS>
though
Florence
be
tolerably
populous
,
there
seem
to
be
very
little
trade
of
any
kind
in
it
:
but
the
inhabitant
flatter
themselves
with
the
prospect
of
reap
great
advantage
from
the
residence
of
one
of
the
arch
-
duke
,
for
whose
reception
they
be
now
repair
the
palace
of
Pitti
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
the
revenue
of
Tuscany
may
amount
to
,
since
the
succession
of
the
prince
of
lorraine
;
but
,
under
the
last
duke
of
the
Medici
family
,
they
be
say
to
produce
two
million
of
crown
,
equal
to
five
hundred
thousand
pound
sterling
.
<EOS>
these
arise
from
a
very
heavy
tax
upon
land
and
house
,
the
portion
of
maiden
,
and
suit
at
law
,
besides
the
duty
upon
traffick
,
a
severe
gabelle
upon
the
necessary
of
life
,
and
a
toll
upon
every
eatable
enter
into
this
capital
.
<EOS>
if
we
may
believe
Leti
,
the
grand
duke
be
then
able
to
raise
and
maintain
an
army
of
forty
thousand
infantry
,
and
three
thousand
horse
;
with
twelve
gallie
,
two
galeasse
,
and
twenty
ship
of
war
.
<EOS>
I
question
if
Tuscany
can
maintain
at
present
above
one
half
of
such
an
armament
.
<EOS>
He
that
now
command
the
emperor
's
navy
,
consist
of
a
few
frigate
,
be
an
Englishman
,
call
Acton
,
who
be
heretofore
captain
of
a
ship
in
our
East
India
company
's
service
.
<EOS>
He
have
lately
embrace
the
catholic
religion
,
and
be
create
admiral
of
Tuscany
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
tolerable
opera
in
Florence
for
the
entertainment
of
the
good
company
,
though
they
do
not
seem
very
attentive
to
the
musick
.
<EOS>
Italy
be
certainly
the
native
country
of
this
art
;
and
yet
,
I
do
not
find
the
people
in
general
either
more
musically
inclined
,
or
better
provide
with
ear
than
their
neighbour
.
<EOS>
here
be
also
a
wretched
troop
of
comedian
for
the
burgeois
,
and
low
class
of
people
:
but
what
seem
most
to
suit
the
taste
of
all
rank
,
be
the
exhibition
of
church
pageantry
.
<EOS>
I
have
occasion
to
see
a
procession
,
where
all
the
noblesse
of
the
city
attend
in
their
coach
,
which
fill
the
whole
length
of
the
great
street
call
the
Corso
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
anniversary
of
a
charitable
institution
in
favour
of
poor
maiden
,
a
certain
number
of
whom
be
portion
every
year
.
<EOS>
about
two
hundred
of
these
virgin
walk
in
procession
,
two
and
two
together
,
cloathe
in
violet
-
colour
wide
gown
,
with
white
veil
on
their
head
,
and
make
a
very
classical
appearance
.
<EOS>
They
be
precede
and
follow
by
an
irregular
mob
of
penitent
in
sack
-
cloth
,
with
light
taper
,
and
monk
carry
crucifix
,
bawl
and
bellow
the
litany
:
but
the
great
object
be
a
figure
of
the
Virgin
Mary
,
as
big
as
the
life
,
stand
within
a
gilt
frame
,
dress
in
a
gold
stuff
,
with
a
large
hoop
,
a
great
quantity
of
false
jewel
<EOS>
,
her
face
paint
and
patch
,
and
her
hair
frizzle
and
curl
in
the
very
extremity
of
the
fashion
.
<EOS>
very
little
regard
have
be
pay
to
the
image
of
our
Saviour
on
the
cross
;
but
when
his
lady
-
mother
appear
on
the
shoulder
of
three
or
four
lusty
friar
,
the
whole
populace
fall
upon
their
knee
in
the
dirt
.
<EOS>
this
extraordinary
veneration
pay
to
the
Virgin
,
must
have
be
derive
originally
from
the
French
,
who
pique
themselves
on
their
gallantry
to
the
fair
sex
.
  
<EOS>
amidst
all
the
scenery
of
the
roman
catholic
religion
,
I
have
never
yet
see
any
of
the
spectator
affect
at
heart
,
or
discover
the
least
sign
of
fanaticism
.
<EOS>
the
very
disciplinant
,
who
scourge
themselves
in
the
Holy
-
week
,
be
generally
peasant
or
party
hire
for
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
those
of
the
confrairie
,
who
have
an
ambition
to
distinguish
themselves
on
such
occasion
,
take
care
to
secure
their
back
from
the
smart
,
by
mean
of
secret
armour
,
either
woman
's
boddice
,
or
quilt
jacket
.
<EOS>
the
confrairie
be
fraternity
of
devotee
,
who
inlist
themselves
under
the
banner
of
particular
saint
.
<EOS>
on
day
of
procession
they
appear
in
a
body
dress
as
penitent
and
mask
,
and
distinguish
by
crosse
on
their
habit
.
<EOS>
there
be
scarce
an
individual
,
whether
noble
or
plebeian
,
who
do
not
belong
to
one
of
these
association
,
which
may
be
compare
to
the
FreeMasons
,
Gregoreans
,
and
Antigallicans
of
England
.
  
<EOS>
just
without
one
of
the
gate
of
Florence
,
there
be
a
triumphal
arch
erect
on
occasion
of
the
late
emperor
's
make
his
public
entry
,
when
he
succeed
to
the
dukedom
of
Tuscany
:
and
herein
the
summer
evening
,
the
quality
resort
to
take
the
air
in
their
coach
.
<EOS>
every
carriage
stop
,
and
form
a
little
separate
conversazione
.
<EOS>
the
lady
sit
within
,
and
the
cicisbei
stand
on
the
foot
-
board
,
on
each
side
of
the
coach
,
entertain
them
with
their
discourse
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
no
unpleasant
inquiry
to
trace
this
sort
of
gallantry
to
its
original
,
and
investigate
all
its
progress
.
<EOS>
the
Italians
,
have
be
accuse
of
jealousy
,
be
resolve
to
wipe
off
the
reproach
,
and
,
seek
to
avoid
it
for
the
future
,
have
run
into
the
other
extreme
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
be
generally
suppose
that
the
custom
of
choose
cicisbei
,
be
calculate
to
prevent
the
extinction
of
family
,
which
would
otherwise
often
happen
in
consequence
of
marriage
found
upon
interest
,
without
any
mutual
affection
in
the
contracting
party
.
<EOS>
how
far
this
political
consideration
may
have
weigh
against
the
jealous
and
vindictive
temper
of
the
Italians
,
I
will
not
pretend
to
judge
:
but
,
certain
it
be
,
every
married
lady
in
this
country
have
her
cicisbeo
,
or
servente
,
who
attend
her
<EOS>
every
where
,
and
on
all
occasion
;
and
upon
whose
privilege
the
husband
dare
not
encroach
,
without
incur
the
censure
and
ridicule
of
the
whole
community
.
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
would
rather
be
condemn
for
life
to
the
gallie
,
than
exercise
the
office
of
a
cicisbeo
,
expose
to
the
intolerable
caprice
and
dangerous
resentment
of
an
italian
virago
.
<EOS>
I
pretend
not
to
judge
of
the
national
character
,
from
my
own
observation
:
but
,
if
the
portrait
draw
by
Goldoni
in
his
comedy
be
take
from
nature
,
I
would
not
hesitate
to
pronounce
the
italian
woman
the
most
haughty
,
insolent
,
capricious
,
and
revengeful
female
on
the
face
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
indeed
their
resentment
be
so
cruelly
implacable
,
and
contain
such
a
mixture
of
perfidy
,
that
,
in
my
opinion
,
they
be
very
unfit
subject
for
comedy
,
whose
province
it
be
,
rather
to
ridicule
folly
than
to
stigmatize
such
atrocious
vice
.
  
<EOS>
You
have
often
hear
it
say
,
that
the
purity
of
the
Italian
be
to
be
find
in
the
lingua
Toscana
,
and
bocca
Romana
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
the
pronunciation
of
the
Tuscans
be
disagreeably
guttural
:
the
letter
C
and
G
they
pronounce
with
an
aspiration
,
which
hurt
the
ear
of
an
Englishman
;
and
be
I
think
rather
rough
than
that
of
the
x
,
in
Spanish
.
<EOS>
It
sound
as
if
the
speaker
have
lose
his
palate
.
<EOS>
I
really
imagine
the
first
man
I
hear
speak
in
Pisa
,
have
meet
with
that
misfortune
in
the
course
of
his
amour
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
the
great
curiosity
you
meet
with
in
Italy
,
be
the
Improvisatore
;
such
be
the
name
give
to
certain
individual
,
who
have
the
surprising
talent
of
recite
verses
extempore
,
on
any
subject
you
propose
.
<EOS>
Mr
Corvesi
,
my
landlord
,
have
a
son
,
a
franciscan
friar
,
who
be
a
great
genius
in
this
way
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
subject
be
give
,
his
brother
tune
his
violin
to
accompany
him
,
and
he
begin
to
rehearse
in
recitative
,
with
wonderful
fluency
and
precision
.
<EOS>
thus
he
will
,
at
a
minute
's
warning
,
recite
two
or
three
hundred
verse
,
well
turn
,
and
well
adapt
,
and
generally
mingle
with
an
elegant
compliment
to
the
company
.
<EOS>
the
Italians
be
so
fond
of
poetry
,
that
many
of
them
,
have
the
good
part
of
Ariosto
,
Tasso
,
and
Petrarch
,
by
heart
;
and
these
be
the
great
source
from
which
the
Improvisatori
draw
their
rhime
,
cadence
,
and
turn

lest

<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
Your
entertaining
letter
of
the
fifth
of
last
month
,
be
a
very
charitable
and
a
very
agreeable
donation
:
but
your
suspicion
be
groundless
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
upon
my
honour
,
I
have
no
share
whatever
in
any
of
the
dispute
which
agitate
the
public
:
nor
do
I
know
any
thing
of
your
political
transaction
,
except
what
I
casually
see
in
one
of
your
newspaper
,
with
the
perusal
of
which
I
be
sometimes
favour
by
our
consul
at
Villefranche
.
<EOS>
You
insist
upon
my
be
more
particular
in
my
remark
on
what
I
see
at
Florence
,
and
I
shall
obey
the
injunction
.
<EOS>
the
famous
gallery
which
contain
the
antiquity
,
be
the
third
story
of
a
noble
stone
-
edifice
,
build
in
the
form
of
the
Greek
Pi
,
the
upper
part
front
the
river
Arno
,
and
one
of
the
leg
adjoin
to
the
ducal
-
palace
,
where
the
court
of
justice
be
hold
.
<EOS>
as
the
house
of
Medici
have
for
some
century
reside
in
the
palace
of
Pitti
,
situate
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
,
a
full
mile
from
these
tribunal
,
the
architect
Vasari
,
who
plan
the
new
edifice
,
at
the
same
time
contrive
a
corridore
,
or
cover
passage
,
extend
from
the
palace
of
Pitti
along
one
of
the
bridge
,
to
the
gallery
of
curiosity
,
through
which
the
grand-
duke
pass
unseen
,
when
he
be
dispose
either
to
amuse
himself
with
his
antiquity
,
or
to
assist
at
his
court
of
judicature
:
but
there
be
nothing
very
extraordinary
either
in
the
contrivance
or
execution
of
this
corridore
.
  
<EOS>
if
I
reside
in
Florence
I
would
give
something
extraordinary
for
permission
to
walk
every
day
in
the
gallery
,
which
I
should
much
prefer
to
the
Lycaeum
,
the
grove
of
Academus
,
or
any
porch
or
philosophical
alley
in
Athens
or
in
Rome
.
<EOS>
here
by
view
the
statue
and
bust
range
on
each
side
,
I
should
become
acquainted
with
the
face
of
all
the
remarkable
personage
,
male
and
female
,
of
antiquity
,
and
even
be
able
to
trace
their
different
character
from
the
expression
of
their
feature
.
<EOS>
this
collection
be
a
most
excellent
commentary
upon
the
roman
historian
,
particularly
Suetonius
and
Dion
Cassius
.
<EOS>
there
be
one
circumstance
that
strike
me
in
view
the
bust
of
Caracalla
,
both
here
and
in
the
Capitol
at
Rome
;
there
be
a
certain
ferocity
in
the
eye
,
which
seem
to
contradict
the
sweetness
of
the
other
feature
,
and
remarkably
justify
the
epithet
Caracuyl
,
by
which
he
be
distinguish
by
the
antient
inhabitant
of
North
-
Britain
.
<EOS>
in
the
language
of
the
Highlanders
caracuyl
signify
cruel
eye
,
as
we
be
give
to
understand
by
the
ingenious
editor
of
Fingal
,
who
seem
to
think
that
Caracalla
be
no
other
than
the
celtic
word
,
adapt
to
the
pronunciation
of
the
Romans
:
but
the
truth
be
,
Caracalla
be
the
name
of
a
gaulish
vestment
,
which
this
prince
affect
to
wear
;
and
hence
he
derive
that
surname
.
<EOS>
the
Caracuyl
of
the
Britons
,
be
the
same
as
the
upodra
idon
of
the
Greeks
,
which
Homer
have
so
often
apply
to
his
Scolding
Heroes
.
<EOS>
I
like
the
Bacchanalian
,
chiefly
for
the
fine
drapery
.
<EOS>
the
wind
,
occasion
by
her
motion
,
seem
to
have
swell
and
raise
it
from
the
part
of
the
body
which
it
cover
.
<EOS>
there
be
another
gay
Bacchanalian
,
in
the
attitude
of
dancing
,
crown
with
ivy
,
hold
in
her
right
hand
a
bunch
of
grape
,
and
in
her
leave
the
thyrsus
.
<EOS>
the
head
of
the
celebrated
Flora
be
very
beautiful
:
the
groupe
of
Cupid
and
Psyche
,
however
,
do
not
give
me
all
the
pleasure
I
expect
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
of
all
the
marble
that
appear
in
the
open
gallery
,
the
follow
be
those
I
most
admire
.
<EOS>
leda
with
the
Swan
;
as
for
Jupiter
,
in
this
transformation
,
he
have
much
the
appearance
of
a
goose
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
any
thing
tame
;
but
the
sculptor
have
admirably
shew
his
art
in
represent
Leda
's
hand
partly
hide
among
the
feather
,
which
be
so
lightly
touch
off
,
that
the
very
shape
of
the
finger
be
see
underneath
.
<EOS>
the
statue
of
a
youth
,
suppose
to
be
Ganymede
,
be
compare
by
the
connoisseur
to
the
celebrated
Venus
,
and
as
far
as
I
can
judge
,
not
without
reason
:
it
be
however
,
rather
agreeable
than
strike
,
and
will
please
a
connoisseur
much
more
than
a
common
spectator
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
it
be
my
regard
to
the
faculty
that
inhance
the
value
of
the
noted
Aesculapius
,
who
appear
with
a
venerable
beard
of
delicate
workmanship
.
<EOS>
He
be
large
than
the
life
,
cloathe
in
a
magnificent
pallium
,
his
left
arm
rest
on
a
knotted
staff
,
round
which
the
snake
be
twine
accord
to
Ovid
.
  
<EOS>
hunc
modo
serpentem
baculum
qui
nexibus
ambit
Perspice
    
Behold
the
snake
<EOS>
his
mystic
Rod
intwine
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
in
his
hand
the
fascia
herbarum
,
and
the
crepidae
on
his
foot
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
wild
-
boar
represent
lie
on
one
side
,
which
I
admire
as
a
master
-
piece
.
<EOS>
the
savageness
of
his
appearance
be
finely
contrast
with
the
case
and
indolence
of
the
attitude
.
<EOS>
be
I
to
meet
with
a
live
boar
lie
with
the
same
expression
,
I
should
be
tempt
to
stroke
his
bristle
.
<EOS>
here
be
an
elegant
bust
of
Antinous
,
the
favourite
of
Adrian
;
and
a
beautiful
head
of
Alexander
the
Great
,
turn
on
one
side
,
with
an
expression
of
languishment
and
anxiety
in
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
the
virtuosi
be
not
agree
about
the
circumstance
in
which
he
be
represent
;
whether
faint
with
the
loss
of
blood
which
he
suffer
in
his
adventure
at
oxydrace
;
or
languish
with
the
fever
contract
by
bathe
in
the
Cydnus
;
or
finally
complain
to
his
father
Jove
,
that
there
be
no
other
world
for
him
to
conquer
.
<EOS>
the
kneel
Narcissus
be
a
striking
figure
,
and
the
expression
admirable
.
<EOS>
the
two
Bacchi
be
perfectly
well
execute
;
but
(
to
my
shame
be
it
speak
)
<EOS>
I
prefer
to
the
antique
that
which
be
the
work
of
Michael
Angelo
Buonaroti
,
concern
which
the
story
be
tell
which
you
well
know
.
<EOS>
the
artist
have
be
blame
by
some
pretend
connoisseur
,
for
not
imitate
the
manner
of
the
ancient
,
be
say
to
have
privately
finish
this
Bacchus
,
and
bury
it
,
after
have
break
off
an
arm
,
which
he
keep
as
a
voucher
.
<EOS>
the
statue
,
be
dig
up
by
accident
,
be
allow
by
the
good
judge
,
to
be
a
perfect
antique
;
upon
which
Buonaroti
produce
the
arm
,
and
claim
his
own
work
.
<EOS>
Bianchi
look
upon
this
as
a
fable
;
but
own
that
Vasari
tell
such
another
of
a
child
cut
in
marble
by
the
same
artist
,
which
be
carry
to
Rome
,
and
keep
for
some
time
under
ground
,
be
dig
up
as
an
antique
,
and
sell
for
a
great
deal
of
money
.
<EOS>
I
be
likewise
attract
by
the
Morpheus
in
touchstone
,
which
be
describe
by
Addison
,
who
,
by
the
bye
,
notwithstanding
all
his
taste
,
have
be
convict
by
Bianchi
of
several
gross
blunder
in
his
account
of
this
gallery
.
  
<EOS>
with
respect
to
the
famous
Venus
Pontia
,
commonly
call
de
Medicis
,
which
be
find
at
Tivoli
,
and
be
keep
in
a
separate
apartment
call
the
Tribuna
<EOS>
,
I
believe
I
ought
to
be
intirely
silent
,
or
at
least
conceal
my
real
sentiment
,
which
will
otherwise
appear
equally
absurd
and
presumptuous
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
want
of
taste
that
prevent
my
feeling
that
enthusiastic
admiration
with
which
other
be
inspire
at
sight
of
this
statue
:
a
statue
which
in
reputation
equal
that
of
Cupid
by
Praxiteles
,
which
bring
such
a
concourse
of
stranger
of
old
to
the
little
town
of
Thespiae
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
think
that
there
be
no
beauty
in
the
feature
of
Venus
;
and
that
the
attitude
be
aukward
and
out
of
character
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
bad
plea
to
urge
that
the
antient
and
we
differ
in
the
idea
of
beauty
.
<EOS>
We
know
the
contrary
,
from
their
medal
,
bust
,
and
historian
.
<EOS>
without
all
doubt
,
the
limb
and
proportion
of
this
statue
be
elegantly
form
,
and
accurately
design
,
accord
to
the
nice
rule
of
symmetry
and
proportion
;
and
the
back
part
especially
be
execute
so
happily
,
as
to
excite
the
admiration
of
the
most
indifferent
spectator
.
<EOS>
one
can
not
help
think
it
be
the
very
Venus
of
Cnidos
by
Praxiteles
,
which
Lucian
describe
.
"
<EOS>
Hercle
quanta
dorsi
concinnitas
!
<EOS>
ut
<EOS>
exuberante
lumbi
amplexante
manus
implent
!
<EOS>
quam
scite
circumductae
clunium
pulpae
in
se
rotundantur
,
neque
tenues
nimis
<EOS>
ipsis
ossibus
adstrictae
,
neque
in
immensam
effusae
Pinguedinem
!
"
<EOS>
that
the
statue
thus
describe
be
not
the
Venus
de
Medicis
,
would
appear
from
the
greek
inscription
on
the
base
,
KLEOMENIS
APPOLLODOROI
ATHINAIOS
EPOESEI
.
<EOS>
Cleomenes
filiu
Apollodori
fecit
;
do
we
not
know
that
this
inscription
be
count
spurious
,
and
that
instead
of
EPOESEI
,
it
should
be
epoiese
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
but
a
frivolous
objection
,
as
we
have
see
many
inscription
undoubtedly
antique
,
in
which
the
orthography
be
false
,
either
from
the
ignorance
or
carelessness
of
the
sculptor
.
<EOS>
other
suppose
,
not
without
reason
,
that
this
statue
be
a
representation
of
the
famous
Phryne
,
the
courtesan
of
Athens
,
who
at
the
celebration
of
the
eleusinian
game
,
exhibit
herself
come
out
of
the
bath
,
naked
,
to
the
eye
of
the
whole
athenian
people
.
<EOS>
I
be
much
pleased
with
the
dancing
faun
;
and
still
better
with
the
Lotti
,
or
wrestler
,
the
attitude
of
which
be
beautifully
contrive
to
shew
the
different
turn
of
the
limb
,
and
the
swelling
of
the
muscle
:
but
<EOS>
,
what
please
me
good
of
all
the
statue
in
the
Tribuna
be
the
Arrotino
,
commonly
call
the
Whetter
,
and
generally
suppose
to
represent
a
slave
,
who
in
the
act
of
whet
a
knife
,
overhear
the
conspiracy
of
Catiline
.
<EOS>
You
know
he
be
represent
on
one
knee
;
and
certain
it
be
,
I
never
see
such
an
expression
of
anxious
attention
,
as
appear
in
his
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
mingle
with
any
mark
of
surprise
,
such
as
could
not
fail
to
lay
hold
on
a
man
who
overhear
by
accident
a
conspiracy
against
the
state
.
<EOS>
the
marquis
de
Maffei
have
justly
observe
that
Sallust
,
in
his
very
circumstantial
detail
of
that
conspiracy
,
make
no
mention
of
any
such
discovery
.
<EOS>
neither
do
it
appear
that
the
figure
be
in
the
act
of
whetting
,
the
stone
which
he
hold
in
one
hand
be
rough
and
unequal
no
way
resemble
a
whetstone
.
<EOS>
other
alledge
it
represent
Milico
,
the
freedman
of
Scaevinus
,
who
conspire
against
the
life
of
Nero
,
and
give
his
poignard
to
be
whet
to
Milico
,
who
present
it
to
the
emperor
,
with
an
account
of
the
conspiracy
:
but
the
attitude
and
expression
<EOS>
will
by
no
means
admit
of
this
interpretation
.
<EOS>
Bianchi
,
[
this
antiquarian
be
now
imprison
for
Life
,
for
have
rob
the
Gallery
and
then
set
it
on
fire
.
]
<EOS>
who
show
the
gallery
,
think
the
statue
represent
the
augur
Attius
Navius
,
who
cut
a
stone
with
a
knife
,
at
the
command
of
Tarquinius
Priscus
.
<EOS>
this
conjecture
seem
to
be
confirm
by
a
medallion
of
Antoninus
Pius
,
insert
by
Vaillant
among
his
Numismata
Prestantiora
,
on
which
be
delineate
nearly
such
a
figure
as
this
in
question
,
with
the
follow
legend
.
"
<EOS>
Attius
Navius
genuflexus
ante
Tarquinium
Priscum
cotem
cultro
discidit
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
own
indeed
that
in
the
statue
,
the
augur
be
not
distinguish
either
by
his
habit
or
emblem
;
and
he
may
have
add
,
neither
be
the
stone
a
cote
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
think
neither
of
these
three
opinion
be
satisfactory
,
though
the
last
be
very
ingenious
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
figure
allude
to
a
private
incident
,
which
never
be
record
in
any
history
.
<EOS>
among
the
great
number
of
picture
in
this
Tribuna
,
I
be
most
charm
with
the
Venus
by
Titian
,
which
have
a
sweetness
of
expression
and
tenderness
of
colouring
,
not
to
be
describe
.
<EOS>
in
this
apartment
,
they
reckon
three
hundred
piece
,
the
great
part
by
the
good
master
,
particularly
by
Raphael
,
in
the
three
manner
by
which
he
distinguish
himself
at
different
period
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
celebrated
statue
of
the
hermaphrodite
,
which
we
find
in
another
room
,
I
give
the
sculptor
credit
for
his
ingenuity
in
mingle
the
sex
in
the
composition
;
but
it
be
,
at
good
,
no
other
than
a
monster
in
nature
,
which
I
never
have
any
pleasure
in
view
:
nor
,
indeed
,
do
I
think
there
be
much
talent
require
in
represent
a
figure
with
the
head
and
breast
of
a
woman
,
and
all
the
other
part
of
the
body
masculine
.
<EOS>
there
be
such
a
profusion
of
curiosity
in
this
celebrated
musaeum
;
statue
,
bust
,
picture
,
medal
,
table

in
the
way

<EOS>
cabinet
adorn
with
precious

,
jewel
of
all
sort
,
mathematical
instrument
,
antient
arm
and
military
machine
,
that
the
imagination
be
bewilder
,
and
a
stranger
of
a
visionary
turn
,
would
be
apt
to
fancy
himself
in
a
palace
of
the
fairy
,
raise
and
adorn
by
the
power
of
inchantment
.
  
<EOS>
in
one
of
the
detached
apartment
,
I
see
the
antependium
of
the
altar
,
design
for
the
famous
chapel
of
St
Lorenzo
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
curious
piece
of
architecture
,
inlay
with
coloured
marble
and
precious
stone
,
so
as
to
represent
an
infinite
variety
of

<EOS>
It
be
adorn
with
some
crystal

<EOS>
the
second
story
of
the
building
be
occupy
by
a
great
number
of
artist
employ
in
this
very
curious
work
of
marquetry
,
represent
figure
with
gem
and
different
kind
of
coloured
marble
,
for
the
use
of
the
emperor
.
<EOS>
the
Italians
call
it
pietre
commesse
,
a
sort
of
inlay
with
stone
,
analogous
to
the
fineering
of
cabinet
in
wood
.
<EOS>
It
be
peculiar
to
Florence
,
and
seem
to
be
still
more
curious
than
the
Mosaic
work
,
which
the
Romans
have
bring
to
great
perfection
.
  
<EOS>
the
cathedral
of
Florence
be
a
great
gothic
building
,
encrust
on
the
outside
with
marble
;
it
be
remarkable
for
nothing
but
its
cupola
,
which
be
say
to
have
be
copy
by
the
architect
of
St
Peter
's
at
Rome
,
and
for
its
size
,
which
be
much
great
than
that
of
any
other
church
in
Christendom
.
 
<EOS>
[
in
this
cathedral
be
the
Tomb
of
Johannes
<EOS>
Acutus
Anglus
,
which
a
man
would
naturally
interpret
as
John
Sharp
;
but
his
name
be
really
Hawkwood
,
which
the
Italians
have
corrupt
into
Acut
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
celebrated
General
or
Condottiere
who
arrive
in
Italy
at
the
head
of
four
thousand
soldier
of
fortune
,
mostly
Englishmen
who
have
serve
with
him
in
the
army
of
King
Edward
III
,
and
be
dismiss
at
the
Peace
of
Bontigny
.
<EOS>
Hawkwood
greatly
distinguish
himself
in
Italy
by
his
valour
and
conduct
,
and
die
a
very
old
man
in
the
Florentine
service
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
son
of
a
Tanner
in
Essex
,
and
have
be
put
apprentice
to
a
Taylor
.
]
<EOS>
the
baptistery
,
which
stand
by
it
,
be
an
antient
temple
,
say
to
be
dedicate
to
Mars
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
good
statue
of
marble
within
;
and
one
or
two
of
bronze
on
the
outside
of
the
door
;
but
it
be
chiefly
celebrate
for
the
embossed
work
of
its
brass
gate
,
by
Lorenzo
Ghiberti
,
which
Buonaroti
use
to
say
,
deserve
to
be
make
the
gate
of
Paradise
.
<EOS>
I
view
them
with
pleasure
:
<EOS>
but
still
I
retain
a
great
veneration
for
those
of
Pisa
,
which
I
have
first
admire
:
a
preference
which
either
arise
from
want
of
taste
,
or
from
the
charm
of
novelty
,
by
which
the
former
be
recommend
to
my
attention
.
<EOS>
those
who
would
have
a
particular
detail
of
every
thing
worth
see
at
Florence
,
comprehend
church
,
library
,
palace
,
tomb
,
statue
,
picture
,
fountain
,
bridge
,
etc
.
may
consult
Keysler
,
who
be
so
laboriously
circumstantial
in
his
description
,
that
I
never
could
peruse
them
,
without
suffer
the
headache
,
and
recollect
the
old
observation
,
that
the
german
genius
lie
more
in
the
back
than
in
the
brain
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
much
disappointed
in
the
chapel
of
St
Lorenzo
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
great
profusion
of
granite
,
porphyry
,
jasper
,
verde
antico
,
lapis
-
lazuli
,
and
other
precious
stone
,
represent
figure
in
the
way
of
marquetry
,
I
think
the
whole
have
a
gloomy
effect
.
<EOS>
these
pietre
commesse
be
better
calculate
for
cabinet
,
than
for
ornament
to
great
building
,
which
ought
to
be
large
masse
proportion
to
the
greatness
of
the
edifice
.
<EOS>
the
compartment
be
so
small
,
that
they
produce
no
effect
in
give
the
first
impression
when
one
enter
the
place
;
except
to
give
an
air
of
littleness
to
the
whole
,
just
as
if
a
grand
saloon
be
cover
with
picture
paint
in
miniature
.
<EOS>
if
they
have
as
little
regard
to
proportion
and
perspective
,
when
they
paint
the
dome
,
which
be
not
yet
finish
,
this
chapel
will
,
in
my
opinion
,
remain
a
monument
of
ill
taste
and
extravagance
.
  
<EOS>
the
court
of
the
palace
of
Pitti
be
form
by
three
side
of
an
elegant
square
,
with
arcade
all
round
,
like
the
palace
of
Holyrood
house
at
Edinburgh
;
and
the
rustic
work
,
which
constitute
the
low
part
of
the
building
,
give
it
an
air
of
strength
and
magnificence
.
<EOS>
in
this
court
,
there
be
a
fine
fountain
,
in
which
the
water
trickle
down
from
above
;
and
here
be
also
an
admirable
antique
statue
of
Hercules
,
inscribe
LUSIPPOI
ERGON
,
the
work
of
Lysippus
.
  
<EOS>
the
apartment
of
this
palace
be
generally
small
,
and
many
of
them
dark
.
<EOS>
among
the
painting
the
most
remarkable
be
the
Madonna
de
la
Seggiola
,
by
Raphael
,
count
one
of
the
good
coloured
piece
of
that
great
master
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
allow
to
find
fault
with
the
performance
,
I
should
pronounce
it
defective
in
dignity
and
sentiment
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
expression
of
a
peasant
rather
than
of
the
mother
of
God
.
<EOS>
She
exhibit
the
fondness
and
joy
of
a
young
woman
towards
her
firstborn
son
,
without
that
rapture
of
admiration
which
we
expect
to
find
in
the
Virgin
Mary
,
while
she
contemplate
,
in
the
fruit
of
her
own
womb
,
the
Saviour
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
in
other
respect
,
it
be
a
fine
figure
,
gay
,
agreeable
,
and
very
expressive
of
maternal
tenderness
;
and
the
bambino
be
extremely
beautiful
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
english
painter
employ
in
copy
this
picture
,
and
what
he
have
do
be
execute
with
great
success
.
<EOS>
I
be
one
of
those
who
think
it
very
possible
to
imitate
the
good
piece
in
such
a
manner
,
that
even
the
connoisseur
shall
not
be
able
to
distinguish
the
original
from
the
copy
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
I
do
not
set
up
for
a
judge
in
these
matter
,
and
very
likely
I
may
incur
the
ridicule
of
the
virtuosi
for
the
remark
I
have
make
:
but
I
be
use
to
speak
my
mind
freely
on
all
subject
that
fall
under
the
cognizance
of
my
sense
;
though
I
must
as
freely
own
,
there
be
something
more
than
common
sense
require
to
discover
and
distinguish
the
more
delicate
beauty
of
painting
.
<EOS>
I
can
safely
say
,
however
,
that
without
any
daubing
at
all
,
I
be

very
sincerely
 
Your

<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
have
see
all
the
curiosity
of
Florence
,
and
hire
a
good
travel
coach
for
seven
week
,
at
the
price
of
seven
zequine
,
something
less
than
three
guinea
and
a
half
,
we
set
out
post
for
Rome
,
by
the
way
of
Sienna
,
where
we
lay
the
first
night
.
<EOS>
the
country
through
which
we
pass
be
mountainous
but
agreeable
.
<EOS>
of
Sienna
I
can
say
nothing
from
my
own
observation
,
but
that
we
be
indifferently
lodge
in
a
house
that
stink
like
a
privy
,
and
fare
wretchedly
at
supper
.
<EOS>
the
city
be
large
and
well
build
:
the
inhabitant
pique
themselves
upon
their
politeness
,
and
the
purity
of
their
dialect
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
some
stranger
reside
in
this
place
on
purpose
to
learn
the
good
pronunciation
of
the
italian
tongue
.
<EOS>
the
mosaic
pavement
of
their
duomo
,
or
cathedral
,
have
be
much
admire
;
as
well
as
the
history
of
Aeneas
Sylvius
,
afterwards
pope
Pius
II
,
paint
on
the
wall
of
the
library
,
partly
by
Pietro
Perugino
,
and
partly
by
his
pupil
Raphael
D'Urbino
.
  
<EOS>
next
day
,
at
Buon
Convento
,
where
the
emperor
Henry
VII
be
poison
by
a
friar
with
the
sacramental
wafer
,
I
refuse
to
give
money
to
the
hostler
,
who
in
revenge
put
two
young
unbroke
stone
-
horse
in
the
trace
next
to
the
coach
,
which
become
so
unruly
,
that
before
we
have
go
a
quarter
of
a
mile
,
they
and
the
postilion
be
roll
in
the
dust
.
<EOS>
in
this
situation
they
make
such
effort
to
disengage
themselves
,
and
kick
with
such
violence
,
that
I
imagine
the
carriage
and
all
our
trunk
would
have
be
beat
in
piece
.
<EOS>
We
leap
out
of
the
coach
,
however
,
without
sustain
any
personal
damage
,
except
the
fright
;
nor
be
any
hurt
do
to
the
vehicle
.
<EOS>
but
the
horse
be
terribly
bruise
,
and
almost
strangle
,
before
they
could
be
disengage
.
<EOS>
exasperate
at
the
villany
of
the
hostler
,
I
resolve
to
make
a
complaint
to
the
uffiziale
or
magistrate
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
I
find
him
wrap
in
an
old
,
greasy
,
ragged
,
great
-
coat
,
sit
in
a
wretched
apartment
,
without
either
glass
,
paper
,
or
board
in
the
window
;
and
there
be
no
sort
of
furniture
but
a
couple
of
broken
chair
and
a
miserable
truckle
-
bed
.
<EOS>
He
look
pale
,
and
meagre
,
and
have
more
the
air
of
a
half
-
starve
prisoner
than
of
a
magistrate
.
<EOS>
have
hear
my
complaint
,
he
come
forth
into
a
kind
of
outward
room
or
bellfrey
,
and
ring
a
great
bell
with
his
own
hand
.
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
signal
,
the
postmaster
come
up
stair
,
and
I
suppose
he
be
the
first
man
in
the
place
,
for
the
uffiziale
stand
before
him
cap
-
in
-
hand
,
and
with
great
mark
of
humble
respect
repeat
the
complaint
I
have
make
.
<EOS>
this
man
assure
me
,
with
an
air
of
conscious
importance
,
that
he
himself
have
order
the
hostler
to
supply
me
with
those
very
horse
,
which
be
the
good
in
his
stable
;
and
that
the
misfortune
which
happen
be
owe
to
the
misconduct
of
the
fore
-
postilion
,
who
do
not
keep
the
fore
-
horse
to
a
proper
speed
proportion
to
the
mettle
of
the
other
two
.
<EOS>
as
he
take
the
affair
upon
himself
,
and
I
perceive
have
an
ascendancy
over
the
magistrate
,
I
content
myself
with
say
,
I
be
certain
the
two
horse
have
be
put
to
the
coach
on
purpose
,
either
to
hurt
or
frighten
us
;
and
that
since
I
could
not
have
justice
here
I
would
make
a
formal
complaint
to
the
british
minister
at
Florence
.
<EOS>
in
pass
through
the
street
to
the
coach
,
which
be
by
this
time
furnish
with
fresh
horse
,
I
meet
the
hostler
,
and
would
have
cane
him
heartily
;
but
perceive
my
intention
,
he
take
to
his
heel
and
vanish
.
<EOS>
of
all
the
people
I
have
ever
see
,
the
hostler
,
postilion
,
and
other
fellow
hang
about
the
post
-
house
in
Italy
,
be
the
most
greedy
,
impertinent
,
and
provoking
.
<EOS>
Happy
be
those
traveller
who
have
phlegm
enough
to
disregard
their
insolence
and
importunity
:
for
this
be
not
so
disagreeable
as
their
revenge
be
dangerous
.
<EOS>
an
english
gentleman
at
Florence
tell
me
,
that
one
of
those
fellow
,
whom
he
have
strike
for
his
impertinence
,
fly
at
him
with
a
long
knife
,
and
he
could
hardly
keep
him
at
sword
's
point
.
<EOS>
all
of
them
wear
such
knife
,
and
be
very
apt
to
use
them
on
the
slight
provocation
.
<EOS>
but
their
open
attack
be
not
so
formidable
as
their
premeditated
scheme
of
revenge
;
in
the
prosecution
of
which
the
Italians
be
equally
treacherous
and
cruel
.
  
<EOS>
this
night
we
pass
at
a
place
call
Radicofani
,
a
village
and
fort
,
situate
on
the
top
of
a
very
high
mountain
.
<EOS>
the
inn
stand
still
low
than
the
town
.
<EOS>
It
be
build
at
the
expence
of
the
last
grand
-
duke
of
Tuscany
;
be
very
large
,
very
cold
,
and
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
one
would
imagine
it
be
contrive
for
coolness
,
though
situate
so
high
,
that
even
in
the
midst
of
summer
,
a
traveller
would
be
glad
to
have
a
fire
in
his
chamber
.
<EOS>
but
few
,
or
none
of
them
have
fireplace
,
and
there
be
not
a
bed
with
curtain
or
tester
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
all
the
adjacent
country
be
naked
and
barren
.
<EOS>
on
the
third
day
we
enter
the
pope
's
territory
,
some
part
of
which
be
delightful
.
<EOS>
have
pass
Aqua
-
Pendente
,
a
beggarly
town
,
situate
on
the
top
of
a
rock
,
from
whence
there
be
a
romantic
cascade
of
water
,
which
give
it
the
name
,
we
travel
along
the
side
of
the
lake
Bolsena
,
a
beautiful
piece
of
water
about
thirty
mile
in
circuit
,
with
two
island
in
the
middle
,
the
bank
cover
with
noble
plantation
of
oak
and
cypress
.
<EOS>
the
town
of
Bolsena
stand
near
the
ruin
of
the
antient
Volsinium
,
which
be
the
birth
-
place
of
Sejanus
,
be
a
paultry
village
;
and
Montefiascone
,
famous
for
its
wine
,
be
a
poor
,
decay
town
in
this
neighbourhood
,
situate
on
the
side
of
a
hill
,
which
,
accord
to
the
author
of
the
Grand
Tour
,
the
only
directory
I
have
along
with
me
,
be
suppose
to
be
the
Soracte
of
the
ancient
.
<EOS>
if
we
may
believe
Horace
,
Soracte
be
visible
from
Rome
:
for
,
in
his
ninth
ode
,
address
to
Thaliarchus
,
he
say
,
  
Vides
,
ut
alta
stet
nive
candidum
<EOS>
Soracte
    
<EOS>
You
see
how
deeply
wreathed
with
snow
Soracte
lift
his
hoary
head
,
  
but
,
in
order
to
see
Montefiascone
,
his
eyesight
must
have
penetrate
through
the
Mons
Cyminus
,
at
the
foot
of
which
now
stand
the
city
of
Viterbo
.
<EOS>
pliny
tell
us
,
that
Soracte
be
not
far
from
Rome
,
haud
procul
ab
urbe
Roma
;
but
Montefiascone
be
fifty
mile
from
this
city
.
<EOS>
and
Desprez
,
in
his
note
upon
Horace
,
say
it
be
now
call
Monte
S
Oreste
.
<EOS>
Addison
tell
us
he
pass
by
it
in
the
Campania
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
without
indignation
reflect
upon
the
bigotry
of
Mathilda
,
who
give
this
fine
country
to
the
see
of
Rome
,
under
the
dominion
of
which
no
country
be
ever
know
to
prosper
.
  
<EOS>
about
half
way
between
Montefiascone
and
Viterbo
,
one
of
our
fore
-
wheel
fly
off
,
together
with
a
large
splinter
of
the
axle
-
tree
;
and
if
one
of
the
postilion
have
not
by
great
accident
be
a
remarkably
ingenious
fellow
,
we
should
have
be
put
to
the
great
inconvenience
,
as
there
be
no
town
,
or
even
house
,
within
several
mile
.
<EOS>
I
mention
this
circumstance
,
by
way
of
warning
to
other
traveller
,
that
they
may
provide
themselves
with
a
hammer
and
nail
,
a
spare
iron
-
pin
or
two
,
a
large
knife
,
and
bladder
of
grease
,
to
be
use
occasionally
in
case
of
such
misfortune
.
  
<EOS>
the
mountain
of
Viterbo
be
cover
with
beautiful
plantation
and
villas

to
the
roman
nobility

who
come
hither
to
make
the
villegiatura
in
summer
.
<EOS>
of
the
city
of
Viterbo
<EOS>
I
shall
say
nothing
,
but
that
it
be
the
capital
of
that
country
which
Mathilda
give
to
the
roman
see
.
<EOS>
the
place
be
well
build
,
adorn
with
public
fountain
,
and
a
great
number
of
church
and
convent
;
yet
far
from
be
populous
,
the
whole
number
of
inhabitant
,
not
exceed
fifteen
thousand
.
<EOS>
the
post
-
house
be
one
of
the
bad
inn
I
ever
enter
.
  
<EOS>
after
have
pass
this
mountain
,
the
Cyminus
of
the
antient
,
we
skirt
part
of
the
lake
,
which
be
now
call
de
Vico
,
and
whose
bank
afford
the
most
agreeable
rural
prospect
of
hill
and
vale
,
wood
,
glade
and
water
,
shade
and
sun
-
shine
.
<EOS>
a
few
other
very
inconsiderable
place
we
pass
,
and
descend
into
the
Campania
of
Rome
,
which
be
almost
a
desert
.
<EOS>
the
view
of
this
country
in
its
present
situation
,
can
not
but
produce
emotion
of
pity
and
indignation
in
the
mind
of
every
person
who
retain
any
idea
of
its
antient
cultivation
and
fertility
.
<EOS>
It
be
nothing
but
a
naked
withered
down
,
desolate
and
dreary
,
almost
without
inclosure
,
corn
-
field
,
hedge
,
tree
,
shrub
,
house
,
hut
,
or
habitation
;
exhibit
here
and
there
the
ruin
of
an
antient
castellum
,
tomb
,
or
temple
,
and
in
some
place
the
remain
of
a
roman
via
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
much
of
these
antient
pavement
,
and
be
greatly
disappointed
when
I
see
them
.
<EOS>
the
Via
Cassia
or
Cymina
be
pave
with
broad
,
solid
,
flint
-
stone
,
which
must
have
greatly
incommode
the
foot
of
horse
that
travel
upon
it
as
well
as
endanger
the
life
of
the
rider
from
the
slipperiness
of
the
pavement
:
besides
,
it
be
so
narrow
that
two
modern
carriage
could
not
pass
one
another
upon
it
,
without
the
most
imminent
hazard
of
be
overturn
.
<EOS>
I
be
still
of
opinion
that
we
excel
the
ancient
Romans
in
understand
the
convenience
of
life
.
  
<EOS>
the
Grand
Tour
say
,
that
within
four
mile
of
Rome
you
see
a
tomb
on
the
roadside
,
say
to
be
that
of
Nero
,
with
sculpture
in
basso
-
relievo
at
both
end
.
<EOS>
I
do
see
such
a
thing
more
like
a
common
grave
-
stone
,
than
the
tomb
of
an
emperor
.
<EOS>
but
we
be
inform
by
Suetonius
,
that
the
dead
body
of
Nero
,
who
slay
himself
at
the
villa
of
his
freedman
,
be
by
the
care
of
his
two
nurse
and
his
concubine
Atta
,
remove
to
the
sepulchre
of
the
Gens
Domitia
,
immediately
within
the
Porta
del
Popolo
,
on
your
left
hand
as
you
enter
Rome
,
precisely
on
the
spot
where
now
stand
the
church
of
S
Maria
del
Popolo
.
<EOS>
His
tomb
be
even
distinguish
by
an
epitaph
,
which
have
be
preserve
by
Gruterus
.
<EOS>
Giacomo
Alberici
tell
us
very
gravely
in
his
history
of
the
Church
,
that
a
great
number
of
devil
,
who
guard
the
bone
of
this
wicked
emperor
,
take
possession
,
in
the
shape
of
black
raven
,
of
a
walnut
-
tree
,
which
grow
upon
the
spot
;
from
whence
they
insult
every
passenger
,
until
pope
Paschal
II
,
in
consequence
of
a
solemn
fast
and
a
revelation
,
go
thither
in
procession
with
his
court
and
cardinal
,
cut
down
the
tree
,
and
burn
it
to
ashe
,
which
,
with
the
bone
of
Nero
,
be
throw
into
the
Tyber
:
then
he
consecrate
an
altar
on
the
place
,
where
afterwards
the
church
be
build
.
<EOS>
You
may
guess
what
I
feel
at
first
sight
of
the
city
of
Rome
,
which
,
notwithstanding
all
the
calamity
it
have
undergo
,
still
maintain
an
august
and
imperial
appearance
.
<EOS>
It
stand
on
the
farther
side
of
the
Tyber
,
which
we
cross
at
the
Ponte
Molle
,
formerly
call
Pons
Milvius
,
about
two
mile
from
the
gate
by
which
we
enter
.
<EOS>
this
bridge
be
build
by
Aemilius
Censor
,
whose
name
it
originally
bear
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
road
by
which
so
many
hero
return
with
conquest
to
their
country
;
by
which
so
many
king
be
lead
captive
to
Rome
;
and
by
which
the
ambassador
of
so
many
kingdom
and
state
approach
the
seat
of
empire
,
to
deprecate
the
wrath
,
to
sollicit
the
friendship
,
or
sue
for
the
protection
of
the
roman
people
.
<EOS>
It
be
likewise
famous
for
the
defeat
and
death
of
Maxentius
,
who
be
here
overcome
by
Constantine
the
great
.
<EOS>
the
space
between
the
bridge
and
Porta
del
Popolo
,
on
the
right

hand
,
which
be
now
take
up
with
garden
and
villas
,
be
part
of
the
antient
Campus
Martius
,
where
the
comitiae
be
hold
;
and
where
the
roman
people
inure
themselves
to
all
manner
of
exercise
:
it

adorn
with
portico
,
temple
,
theatre
,
bath
,
circi
,

obelisk
,
column
,

<EOS>
author
differ
in
their
opinion
about
the
extent
of
it
;
but
as
they
all
agree
that
it
contain
the
Pantheon
,
the
Circus
Agonis
,
now
the
Piazza
Navona
,
the
Bustum
and
Mausoleum
Augusti
,
great
part
of
the
modern
city
must
be
build
upon
the
ancient
Campus
Martius
.
<EOS>
the
highway
that
lead
from
the
bridge
to
the
city
,
be
part
of
the
Via
Flaminia
,
which
extend
as
far
as
Rimini
;
and
be
well
pave
,
like
a
modern
street
.
<EOS>
nothing
of
the
antient
bridge
remain
but
the
pile
;
nor
be
there
any
thing
in
the
structure
of
this
,
or
of
the
other
five
roman
bridge
over
the
Tyber
,
that
deserve
attention
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
any
bridge
in
France
or
Italy
,
comparable
to
that
of
Westminster
either
in
beauty
,
magnificence
,
or
solidity
;
and
when
the
bridge
at
Black
-
Friars
be
finish
,
it
will
be
such
a
monument
of
architecture
as
all
the
world
can
not
parallel
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
Tyber
,
it
be
,
in
comparison
with
the
Thames
,
no
more
than
an
inconsiderable
stream
,
foul
,
deep
,
and
rapid
.
<EOS>
It
be
navigable
by
small
boat
,
bark
,
and
lighter
;
and
,
for
the
conveniency
of
loading
and
unload
them
,
there
be
a
handsome
quay
by
the
new
custom
-
house
,
at
the
Porto
di
Ripetta
,
provide
with
stair
of
each
side
,
and
adorn
with
an
elegant
fountain
,
that
yield
abundance
of
excellent
water
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
tell
that
the
bed
of
this
river
have
be
considerably
raise
by
the
rubbish
of
old
Rome
,
and
this
be
the
reason
usually
give
for
its
be
so
apt
to
overflow
its
bank
.
<EOS>
a
citizen
of
Rome
tell
me
,
that
a
friend
of
his
lately
dig
to
lay
the
foundation
of
a
new
house
in
the
low
part
of
the
city
,
near
the
bank
of
the
river
,
discover
the
pavement
of
an
antient
street
,
at
the
depth
of
thirty
-
nine
foot
from
the
present
surface
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
conclude
that
modern
Rome
be
near
forty
foot
high
in
this
place
,
than
the
site
of
the
antient
city
,
and
that
the
bed
of
the
river
be
raise
in
proportion
;
but
this
be
altogether
incredible
.
<EOS>
have
the
bed
of
the
Tyber
be
antiently
forty
foot
low
at
Rome
,
than
it
be
at
present
,
there
must
have
be
a
fall
or
cataract
in
it
immediately
above
this
tract
,
as
it
be
not
pretend
that
the
bed
of
it
be
raise
in
any
part
above
the
city
;
otherwise
such
an
elevation
would
have
obstruct
its
course
,
and
then
it
would
have
overflow
the
whole
Campania
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
extraordinary
in
its
present
overflowing
:
they
frequently
happen
of
old
,
and
do
great
mischief
to
the
antient
city
.
<EOS>
appian

Dio

describe
an
inundation
of
the
Tiber
immediately

<EOS>
such

with
a

<EOS>
have
give

we

offer
their

with
the
most
disagreeable
importunity
.
<EOS>
though
I
tell
them
several

I

three

take
possession

thus

<EOS>
stranger
that
come

seldom
put

the

here

well
furnished

and
the
lodger
be
well
supply
with
provision
and
all
necessary
of
life

<EOS>
but
,
if
I
study
oeconomy
,
I
would
choose
another
part
of
the
town
than
the
Piazza

which
be
,
besides

at

great

from

<EOS>
for

the

the

however

which
be
the

veal
I
ever

be
very
dear

be

<EOS>
here
be
the
rich
wine
of
Montepulciano
,
 
Montefiascone

but
what
we
commonly
drink
at
meal
be
that

Orvieto
,
a
small
white
wine
,
of
an
agreeable
flavour
.
<EOS>
stranger
be
generally
advise
to
employ
an
antiquarian
to
instruct
them
in
all
the
curiosity
of
Rome
;
and
this
be
a
necessary
expence
,
when
a
person
want
to
become
a
connoisseur
in
painting
,
statuary
,
and
architecture
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
I
have
no
such
ambition
.
<EOS>
I
long

view
the
remain

antiquity

this

be
distinguish
;

to
contemplate
the
original

many
picture

statue

which
I
have
admire
in
print

description

<EOS>
I
therefore
choose
a
servant
,
who
be
recommend
to
me
as
a
sober
,
intelligent
fellow
,
acquaint
with
these
matter
:
at

I

myself
with
map

this

will
not
purchase
all
the

have
be
publish

on

subject

<EOS>
of
these
the
most
celebrated
be
the
plate
of
Piranesi
,
who
be
not
only
an
ingenious
architect
and
engraver
,
but
also
a
learn
antiquarian
;
though
he
be
apt
to
run
riot
in
his
conjecture
;
and
with
regard
to
the
art
of
antient
Rome
,
have
broach
some
doctrine
,
which
he
will
find
it
very
difficult
to
maintain
.
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
who
go
to
Rome
will
do
well
to
be
upon
their
guard
against
a
set
of
sharper

(
some
of
them
of

who
deal
in
picture

antique

very
often
impose
upon

by
sell
him
trash

<EOS>

than
any
other
foreigner
expose
to
this
imposition
.
<EOS>
They
be
suppose
to
have
more
money
to
throw
away
;
and
therefore
a
great
number
of
snare
be
lay
for
them
.
<EOS>
this
opinion
of
their
superior
wealth
<EOS>
they
take
a
pride
in
confirming
,
by
launch
out
into
all
manner
of
unnecessary
expence
:
<EOS>
but
,
what
be
still
more
dangerous
,
the
moment
they
set
foot
in
Italy
,
they
be
seize
with
the
ambition
of
become
connoisseur
in
painting
,
musick
,
statuary
,
and
architecture
;
and
the
adventurer
of
this
country
do
not
fail
to
flatter
this
weakness
for
their
own
advantage
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
in
different
part
of
Italy
,
a
number
of
raw
boy
,
whom
Britain
seem
to
have
pour
forth
on
purpose
to
bring
her
national
character
into
contempt
,
ignorant
,
petulant
,
rash
,
and
profligate
,
without
any
knowledge
or
experience
of
their
own
,
without
any
director
to
improve
their
understanding
,
or
superintend
their
conduct
.
<EOS>
one
engage
in
play
with
an
infamous
gamester
,
and
be
strip
perhaps
in
the
very
first
partie
:
another
be
pillage
by
an
antiquated
cantatrice
;
a
third
be
bubble
by
a
knavish
antiquarian
;
and
a
fourth
be
lay
under
contribution
by
a
dealer
in
picture
.
<EOS>
some
turn
fiddler
,
and
pretend
to
compose
:
but
all
of
them
talk
familiarly
of
the
art
,
and
return
finish
connoisseur
and
coxcomb
,
to
their
own
country
.
<EOS>
the
most
remarkable
phaenomenon
of
this
kind
,
which
I
have
see
,
be
a
boy
of
seventy
-
two
,
now
actually
travel
through
Italy
,
for
improvement
,
under
the
auspex
of
another
boy
of
twenty
-
two
.
<EOS>
when
you
arrive
at
Rome
,
you
receive
card
from
all
your
country
-
folk
in
that
city
:
they
expect
to
have
the
visit
return
next
day
,
when
they
give
order
not
to
be
at
home
;
and
you
never
speak
to
one
another
in
the
sequel
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
refinement
in
hospitality
and
politeness
,
which
the
English
have
invent
by
the
strength
of
their
own
genius
,
without
any
assistance
either
from
France
,
Italy
,
or
Lapland
.
<EOS>
no
Englishman
above
the
degree
of
a
painter
or
cicerone
frequent
any
coffee
-
house
at
Rome
;
and
as
there
be
no
public
diversion
,
except
in
carnival
-
time
,
the
only
chance
you
have
of
see
your
compatriot
be
either
in
visit
the
curiosity
,
or
at
a
conversazione
.
<EOS>
the
Italians
be
very
scrupulous
in
admit
foreigner
,
except
those
who
be
introduce
as
people
of
quality
:
but
if
there
happen
to
be
any
english
lady
of
fashion
at
Rome
,
she
generally
keep
an
assembly
,
to
which
the
british
subject
resort
.
<EOS>
in
my
next
,
I
shall
communicate
,
without
ceremony
or
affectation
,
what
further
remark
I
have
make
at
Rome
,
without
any
pretence
,
however
,
to
the
character
of
a
connoisseur
,
which
,
without

would

NICE

<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
nothing
can
be
more
agreeable
to
the
eye
of
a
stranger
,
especially
in
the
heat
of
summer
,
than
the
great
number
of
public
fountain
that
appear
in
every
part
of
Rome
,
embellish
with
all
the
ornament
of
sculpture
,
and
pour
forth
prodigious
quantity
of
cool
,
delicious
water
,
bring
in
aqueduct
from
different
lake
,
river
,
and
source
,
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
city
.
<EOS>
these
work
be
the
remain
of
the
munificence
and
industry
of
the
antient
Romans
,
who
be
extremely
delicate
in
the
article
of
water
:
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
great
applause
be
also
due
to
those
beneficent
pope
who
have
be
at
the
expence
of
restore
and
repair
those
noble
channel
of
health
,
pleasure
,
and
convenience
.
<EOS>
this
great
plenty
of
water
,
nevertheless
,
have
not
induce
the
Romans
to
be
cleanly
.
<EOS>
Their
street
,
and
even
their
palace
,
be
disgrace
with
filth
.
<EOS>
the
noble
Piazza
Navona
,
be
adorn
with
three
or
four
fountain
,
one
of
which
be
perhaps
the
most
magnificent
in
Europe
,
and
all
of
them
discharge
vast
stream
of
water
:
but
,
notwithstanding
this
provision
,
the
piazza
be
almost
as
dirty
,
as
West
Smithfield
,
where
the
cattle
be
sell
in
London
.
<EOS>
the
corridore
,
arcade
,
and
even
staircase
of
their
most
elegant
palace
,
be
depository
of
nastiness
,
and
indeed
in
summer
smell
as
strong
as
spirit
of
hartshorn
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
notion
that
their
ancestor
be
not
much
more
cleanly
.
<EOS>
if
we
consider
that
the
city
and
suburb
of
Rome
,
in
the
reign
of
Claudius
,
contain
about
seven
million
of
inhabitant
,
a
number
equal
at
least
to
the
sum
total
of
all
the
soul
in
England
;
that
great
part
of
antient
<EOS>
Rome
be
allot
to
temple
,
porticos
,
basilicae
,
theatre
,
thermae
,
circi
,
public
and
private
walk
and
garden
,
where
very
few
,
if
any
,
of
this
great
number
lodge
;
that
by
far
the
great
part
of
those
inhabitant
be
slave
and
poor
people
,
who
do
not
enjoy
the
conveniencie
of
life
;
and
that
the
use
of
linen
be
scarce
know
;
we
must
naturally
conclude
they
be
strangely
croude
together
,
and
that
in
general
they
be
a
very
frowzy
generation
.
<EOS>
that
they
be
croude
together
appear
from
the
height
of
their
house
,
which
the
poet
Rutilius
compare
to
tower
make
for
scale
heaven
.
<EOS>
in
order
to
remedy
this
inconvenience
,
Augustus
Caesar
publish
a
decree
,
that
for
the
future
no
house
should
be
build
above
seventy
foot
high
,
which
,
at
a
moderate
computation
,
may
make
six
story
.
<EOS>
but
what
seem
to
prove
,
beyond
all
dispute
,
that
the
antient
Romans
be
dirty
creature
,
be
these
two
particular
.
<EOS>
Vespasian
lay
a
tax
upon
urine
and
ordure
,
on
pretence
of
be
at
a
great
expence
in
clear
the
street
from
such
nuisance
;
an
imposition
which
amount
to
about
fourteen
penny
a
year
for
every
individual
;
and
when
Heliogabalus
order
all
the
cobwebs
of
the
city
and
suburb
to
be
collect
,
they
be
find
to
weigh
ten
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
this
be
intend
as
a
demonstration
of
the
great
number
of
inhabitant
;
but
it
be
a
proof
of
their
dirt
,
rather
than
of
their
populosity
.
<EOS>
I
may
likewise
add
,
the
delicate
custom
of
take
vomit
at
each
other
's
house
,
when
they
be
invite
to
dinner
,
or
supper
,
that
they
may
prepare
their
stomach
for
gormandize
;
a
beastly
proof
of
their
nastiness
as
well
as
gluttony
.
<EOS>
horace
,
in
his
description
of
the
banquet
of
Nasiedenus
,
say
,
when
the
canopy
,
under
which
they
sit
,
fall
down
,
it
bring
along
with
it
as
much
dirt
as
be
raise
by
a
hard
gale
of
wind
in
dry
weather
.
                  
<EOS>
trahentia
pulveris
atri
,
Quantum
non
aquilo
<EOS>
Campanis
excitat
agris
.
  
<EOS>
such
cloud
of
dust
revolve
in
its
train
<EOS>
as
Boreas
whirl
along
the
level
plain
.
  
<EOS>
I
may
observe
,
that
the
street
be
often
encumber
with
the
putrefying
carcass
of
criminal
,
who
have
be
drag
through
them
by
the
heel
,
and
precipitate
from
the
Scalae
Gemoniae
,
or
tarpeian
rock
,
before
they
be
throw
into
the
Tyber
,
which
be
the
general
receptacle
of
the
cloaca
maxima
and
all
the
filth
of
Rome
:
besides
,
the
body
of
all
those
who
make
away
with
themselves
,
without
sufficient
cause
;
of
such
as
be
condemn
for
sacrilege
,
or
kill
by
thunder
,
be
leave
unburned
and
unburied
,
to
rot
above
ground
.
  
<EOS>
I
believe
the
modern
retain
more
of
the
custom
of
antient
Romans
,
than
be
generally
imagine
.
<EOS>
when
I
first
see
the
infant
at
the
enfans
trouve
in
Paris
,
so
swathe
with
bandage
,
that
the
very
sight
of
them
make
my
eye
water
,
I
little
dream
,
that
the
prescription
of
the
antient
could
be
plead
for
this
custom
,
equally
shocking
and
absurd
:
<EOS>
but
in
the
Capitol
at
Rome
,
I
meet
with
the
antique
statue
of
a
child
swaddle
exactly
in
the
same
manner
;
roll
up
like
an
aegyptian
mummy
from
the
foot
.
<EOS>
the
circulation
of
the
blood
,
in
such
a
case
,
must
be
obstruct
on
the
whole
surface
of
the
body
;
and
nothing
be
at
liberty
but
the
head
,
which
be
the
only
part
of
the
child
that
ought
to
be
confine
.
<EOS>
be
it
not
surprising
that
common
sense
should
not
point
out
,
even
to
the
most
ignorant
,
that
those
accurse
bandage
must
heat
the
tender
infant
into
a
fever
;
must
hinder
the
action
of
the
muscle
,
and
the
play
of
the
joint
,
so
necessary
to
health
and
nutrition
;
and
that
while
the
refluent
blood
be
obstruct
in
the
vein
,
which
run
on
the
surface
of
the
body
,
the
artery
,
which
lie
deep
,
without
the
reach
of
compression
,
be
continually
pour
their
content
into
the
head
,
where
the
blood
meet
with
no
resistance
?
<EOS>
the
vessel
of
the
brain
be
naturally
lax
,
and
the
very
suture
of
the
skull
be
yet
unclosed
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
consequence
of
this
cruel
swaddling
?
<EOS>
the
limb
be
waste
;
the
joint
grow
rickety
;
the
brain
be
compress
,
and
a
hydrocephalus
,
with
a
great
head
and
sore
eye
,
ensue
.
<EOS>
I
take
this
abominable
practice
to
be
one
great
cause
of
the
bandy
leg
,
diminutive
body
,
and
large
head
,
<EOS>
so
frequent
in
the
south
of
France
,
and
in
Italy
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
no
less
surprised
to
find
the
modern
fashion
of
curl
the
hair
,
borrow
in
a
great
measure
from
the
coxcomb
and
coquette
of
antiquity
.
<EOS>
I
see
a
bust
of
Nero
in
the
gallery
at
Florence
,
the
hair
represent
in
row
of
buckle
,
like
that
of
a
french
petit
-
maitre
,
conformable
to
the
picture
draw
of
him
by
Suetonius
.
<EOS>
Circa
cultum
adeo
pudendum
,
ut
coman
semper
in
gradus
<EOS>
formatam
peregrinatione
achaica
,

,
so
very
finical
in
his
dress
<EOS>
,
that
he
wear
his
hair
in
the
greek
fashion
,
curl
in
row
almost
to
the
crown
of
his
head
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
sorry
however
to
find
that
this
foppery
come
from
Greece
.
<EOS>
as
for
Otho
,
he
wear
a
galericulum
,
or
tour
,
on
account
of
thin
hair
,
propter
raritatem
capillorum
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
right
to
imitate
the
example
of
Julius
Caesar
,
who
conceal
his
bald
head
with
a
wreath
of
laurel
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
bust
in
the
Capitol
of
Julia
Pia
,
the
second
wife
of
Septimius
Severus
,
with
a
moveable
peruke
,
dress
exactly
in
the
fashionable
mode
,
with
this
difference
,
that
there
be
no
part
of
it
frizzle
;
nor
be
there
any
appearance
of
pomatum
and
powder
.
<EOS>
these
improvement
the
beau
-
monde
have
borrow
from
the
native
of
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
.
  
<EOS>
Modern
Rome
do
not
cover
more
than
one
-
third
of
the
space
within
the
wall
;
and
those
part
that
be
most
frequent
of
old
be
now
intirely
abandon
.
<EOS>
from
the
Capitol
to
the
Coliseo
,
include
the
Forum
Romanum
and
Boarium
,
there
be
nothing
intire
<EOS>
but
one
or
two
church
,
build
with
the
fragment
of
ancient
edifice
.
<EOS>
You
descend
from
the
Capitol
between
the
remain
pillar
of
two
temple
,
the
pedestal
and
part
of
the
shaft
sink
in
the
rubbish
:
then
pass
through
the
triumphal
arch
of
Septimius
Severus
,
you
proceed
along
the
foot
of
Mons
Palatinus
,
which
stand
on
your
right
hand
,
quite
cover
with
the
ruin
of
the
antient
palace
belong
to
the
roman
emperor
,
and
at
the
foot
of
it
,
there
be
some
beautiful
detach
pillar
still
stand
.
<EOS>
on
the
left
you
see
the
remain
of
the
Templum
Pacis
,
which
seem
to
have
be
the
large
and
most
magnificent
of
all
the
temple
in
Rome
.
<EOS>
It
be
build
and
dedicate
by
the
emperor
Vespasian
,
who
bring
into
it
all
the
treasure
and
precious
vessel
which
he
find
in
the
temple
of
Jerusalem
.
<EOS>
the
column
of
the
portico
he
remove
from
Nero
's
golden
house
,
which
he
level
with
the
ground
.
<EOS>
this
temple
be
likewise
famous
for
its
library
,
mention
by
Aulus
Gellius
,
further
on
,
be
the
arch
of
Constantine
on
the
right
,
a
most
noble
piece
of
architecture
,
almost
entire
;
with
the
remain
of
the
Meta
Sudans
before
it
;
and
front
you
,
the
noble
ruin
of
that
vast
amphitheatre
,
call
the
Colossaeum
,
now
Coliseo
,
which
have
be
dismantle
and
dilapidate
by
the
gothic
pope
and
prince
of
modern
Rome
,
to
build
and
adorn
their
paultry
palace
.
<EOS>
behind
the
amphitheatre
be
the
thermae
of
the
same
emperor
Titus
Vespasian
.
<EOS>
in
the
same
quarter
be
the
Circus
Maximus
;
and
the
whole
space
from
hence
on
both
side
,
to
the
wall
of
Rome
,
comprehend
above
twice
as
much
ground
as
the
modern
city
,
be
almost
cover
with
the
monument
of
antiquity
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
there
be
more
conceal
below
ground
than
appear
above
.
<EOS>
the
miserable
house
,
and
even
garden
-
wall
of
the
peasant
in
this
district
,
be
build
with
these
precious
material
.
<EOS>
I
mean
shaft
and
capital
of
marble
column
,
head
,
arm
,
leg
,
and
mutilated
trunk
of
statue
.
<EOS>
what
pity
it
be
that
among
all
the
remain
of
antiquity
,
at
Rome
,
there
be
not
one
lodge
-
house
remaining
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
glad
to
know
how
the
senator
of
Rome
be
lodge
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
be
better
inform
touch
the
cava
aedium
,
the
focus
,
the
ara
deorum
penatum
,
the
conclavia
,
triclinia
,
and
caenationes
;
the
atria
where
the
woman
reside
,
and
employ
themselves
in
the
woolen
manufacture
;
the
praetoria
,
which
be
so
spacious
as
to
become
a
nuisance
in
the
reign
of
Augustus
;
and
the
Xysta
,
which
be
shady
walk
between
two
portico
,
where
the
man
exercise
themselves
in
the
winter
.
<EOS>
I
be
disgust
by
the
modern
taste
of
architecture
,
though
I
be
no
judge
of
the
art
.
<EOS>
the
church
and
palace
of
these
day
be
crowd
with
pretty
ornament
,
which
distract
the
eye
,
and
by
break
the
design
into
a
variety
of
little
part
,
destroy
the
effect
of
the
whole
.
<EOS>
every
door
and
window
have
its
separate
ornament
,
its
moulding
,
frize
,
cornice
.
<EOS>
and
tympanum
;
then
there
be
such
an
assemblage
of
useless
festoon
,
pillar
,
pilaster
,
with
their
architrave
,
entablature
,
and
I
know
not
what
,
that
nothing
great
or
uniform
remain
to
fill
the
view
;
and
we
in
vain
look
for
that
simplicity
of
grandeur
,
those
large
masse
of
light
and
shadow
,
and
the
inexpressible
EUSUINOPTON
,
which
characterise
the
edifice
of
the
antient
.
<EOS>
a
great
edifice
,
to
have
its
full
effect
,
ought
to
be
isole
,
or
detach
from
all
other
,
with
a
large
space
around
it
:
but
the
palace
of
Rome
,
and
indeed
of
all
the
other
city
of
Italy
,
which
I
have
see
,
be
so
engaged
among
other
mean
house
,
that
their
beauty
and
magnificence
be
in
a
great
measure
conceal
.
<EOS>
even
those
which
face
open
street
and
piazza
be
only
clear
in
front
.
<EOS>
the
other
apartment
be
darken
by
the
vicinity
of
ordinary
house
;
and
their
view
be
confine
by
dirty
and
disagreeable
object
.
<EOS>
within
the
court
there
be
generally
a
noble
colonnade
all
round
,
and
an
open
corridore
above
,
but
the
stair
be
usually
narrow
,
steep
,
and
high
,
the
want
of
sash
-
window
,
the
dullness
of
their
small
glass
lozenge
,
the
dusty
brick
floor
,
and
the
crimson
hanging
lace
with
gold
,
contribute
to
give
a
gloomy
air
to
their
apartment
;
I
may
add
to
these
cause
,
a
number
of
picture
execute
on
melancholy
subject
,
antique
mutilated
statue
,
bust
,
basso
relieve
,
urn
,
and
sepulchral
stone
,
with
which
their
room
be
adorn
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
own
,
however
,
there
be
some
exception
to
this
general
rule
.
<EOS>
the
villa
of
cardinal
Alexander
Albani
be
light
,
gay
,
and
airy
;
yet
the
room
be
too
small
,
and
too
much
decorate
with
carving
and
gilding
,
which
be
a
kind
of
gingerbread
work
.
<EOS>
the
apartment
of
one
of
the
prince
Borghese
be
furnish
in
the
english
taste
;
and
in
the
palazzo
di
colonna
connestabile
,
there
be
a
saloon
,
or
gallery
,
which
,
for
the
proportion
,
light
,
furniture
,
and
ornament
,
be
the
most
noble
,
elegant
,
and
agreeable
apartment
I
ever
see
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
divert
to
hear
all
italian
expatiate
upon
the
greatness
of
modern
Rome
.
<EOS>
He
will
tell
you
there
be
above
three
hundred
palace
in
the
city
;
that
there
be
scarce
a
roman
prince
,
whose
revenue
do
not
exceed
two
hundred
thousand
crown
;
and
that
Rome
produce
not
only
the
most
learned
man
,
but
also
the
most
refined
politician
in
the
universe
.
<EOS>
to
one
of
them
talk
in
this
strain
,
I
reply
,
that
instead
of
three
hundred
palace
,
the
number
do
not
exceed
fourscore
;
that
I
have
be
inform
,
on
good
authority
,
there
be
not
six
individual
in
Rome
who
have
so
much
as
forty
thousand
crown
a
year
,
about
ten
thousand
pound
sterling
;
and
that
to
say
their
prince
be
so
rich
,
and
their
politician
so
refined
,
be
,
in
effect
,
a
severe
satire
upon
them
,
for
not
employ
their
wealth
and
their
talent
for
the
advantage
of
their
country
.
<EOS>
I
ask
why
their
cardinal
and
prince
do
not
invite
and
encourage
industrious
people
to
settle
and
cultivate
the
Campania
of
Rome
,
which
be
a
desert
?
<EOS>
why
they
do
not
raise
a
subscription
to
drain
the
marsh
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
city
,
and
thus
meliorate
the
air
,
which
be
render
extremely
unwholsome
in
the
summer
,
by
putrid
exhalation
from
those
morass
?
<EOS>
I
demand
of
him
,
why
they
do
not
contribute
their
wealth
,
and
exert
their
political
refinement
,
in
augment
their
force
by
sea
and
land
,
for
the
defence
of
their
country
,
introduce
commerce
and
manufacture
,
and
in
give
some
consequence
to
their
state
,
which
be
no
more
than
a
mite
in
the
political
scale
of
Europe
?
<EOS>
I
express
a
desire
to
know
what
become
of
all
those
sum
of
money
,
inasmuch
as
there
be
hardly
any
circulation
of
gold
and
silver
in
Rome
,
and
the
very
banker
,
on
whom
stranger
have
their
credit
,
make
interest
to
pay
their
tradesman
's
bill
with
paper
note
of
the
bank
of
Spirito
Santo
?
<EOS>
and
now
I
be
upon
this
subject
,
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
observe
that
I
be
strangely
mislead
by
all
the
book
consult
about
the
current
coin
of
Italy
.
<EOS>
in
Tuscany
,
and
the
Ecclesiastical
State
,
one
see
nothing
but
zequine
in
gold
,
and
piece
of
two
paoli
,
one
paolo
,
and
half
a
paolo
,
in
silver
.
<EOS>
besides
these
,
there
be
a
copper
coin
at
Rome
,
call
bajocco
and
mezzo
bajocco
.
<EOS>
ten
bajocchi
make
a
paolo
:
ten
paoli
make
a
scudo
,
which
be
an
imaginary
piece
:
two
scudi
make
a
zequine
;
and
a
French
loui'dore
be
worth
two
zequine
and
two
paoli
.
  
<EOS>
Rome
have
nothing
to
fear
from
the
catholic
power
,
who
respect
it
with
a
superstitious
veneration
as
the
metropolitan
seat
of
their
religion
:
but
the
pope
will
do
well
to
avoid
misunderstanding
with
the
maritime
protestant
state
,
especially
the
English
,
who
be
master
of
the
Mediterranean
,
and
in
possession
of
Minorca
,
have
it
in
their
power
at
all
time
,
to
land
a
body
of
troop
within
four
league
of
Rome
,
and
to
take
the
city
,
without
opposition
.
<EOS>
Rome
be
surround
with
an
old
wall
,
but
altogether
incapable
of
defence
.
<EOS>
or
if
it
be
,
the
circuit
of
the
wall
be
so
extensive
,
that
it
would
require
a
garrison
of
twenty
thousand
man
.
<EOS>
the
only
appearance
of
a
fortification
in
this
city
,
be
the
castle
of
St
Angelo
,
situate
on
the
further
bank
of
the
Tyber
,
to
which
there
be
access
by
a
handsome
bridge
:
but
this
castle
,
which
be
formerly
the
mole
Adriani
,
could
not
hold
out
half
a
day
against
a
battery
of
ten
piece
of
cannon
properly
direct
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
expedient
leave
to
the
invention
of
the
modern
Romans
,
to
convert
an
ancient
tomb
into
a
citadel
.
<EOS>
It
could
only
serve
as
a
temporary
retreat
for
the
pope
in
time
of
popular
commotion
,
and
on
other
sudden
emergency
;
as
it
happen
in
the
case
of
pope
Clement
VII
when
the
troop
of
the
emperor
take
the
city
by
assault
;
and
this
only
,
while
he
reside
at
the
Vatican
,
from
whence
there
be
a
cover
gallery
continue
to
the
castle
:
it
can
never
serve
this
purpose
again
,
while
the
pontiff
live
on
Monte
Cavallo
,
which
be
at
the
other
end
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
the
castle
of
St
Angelo
,
howsoever
ridiculous
as
a
fortress
,
appear
respectable
as
a
noble
monument
of
antiquity
,
and
though
stand
in
a
low
situation
,
be
one
of
the
first
object
that
strike
the
eye
of
a
stranger
approach
Rome

<EOS>
on
the
opposite
side
of

be
the
wretched

the
Mausoleum
Augusti

which
be
still
more
magnificent

<EOS>
part

and
the

<EOS>
in

<EOS>
dear
SIR
,
 
in
my
last
I
give
you
my
opinion
freely
of
the
modern
palace
of
Italy
.
<EOS>
I
shall
now
hazard
my
thought
upon
the
garden
of
this
country
,
which
the
inhabitant
extol
with
all
the
hyperbole
of
admiration
and
applause
.
<EOS>
I
must
acknowledge
however
<EOS>
,
I
have
not
see
the
famous
villas
at
Frascati
and
Tivoli
,
which
be
celebrate
for
their
garden
and
waterworks
.
<EOS>
I
intend
to
visit
these
place
;
but
be
prevent
by
an
unexpected
change
of
weather
,
which
deter
me
from
go
to
the
country
.
<EOS>
on
the
last
day
of
September
the
mountain
of
Palestrina
be
cover
with
snow
;
and
the
air
become
so
cold
at
Rome
,
that
I
be
force
to
put
on
my
winter
cloath
.
<EOS>
this
objection
continue
,
till
I
find
it
necessary
to
set
out
on
my
return
to
Florence
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
see
the
garden
of
the
Poggio
Imperiale
,
and
the
Palazzo
de
Pitti
at
Florence
,
and
those
of
the
Vatican
,
of
the
pope
's
palace
on
Monte
Cavallo
,
of
the
Villa
Ludovisia
,
Medicea
,
and
Pinciana
,
at
Rome
;
so
that
I
think
I
have
some
right
to
judge
of
the
italian
taste
in
gardening
.
<EOS>
among
those
I
have
mention
,
that
of
the
Villa
Pinciana
,
be
the
most
remarkable
,
and
the
most
extensive
,
include
a
space
of
three
mile
in
circuit
,
hard
by
the
wall
of
Rome
,
contain
a
variety
of
situation
high
and
low
,
which
favour
all
the
natural
embellishment
one
would
expect
to
meet
with
in
a
garden
,
and
exhibit
a
diversity
of
noble
view
of
the
city
and
adjacent
country
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
fine
extensive
garden
or
park
,
an
Englishman
expect
to
see
a
number
of
grove
and
glade
,
intermix
with
an
agreeable
negligence
,
which
seem
to
be
the
effect
of
nature
and
accident
.
<EOS>
He
look
for
shady
walk
encrust
with
gravel
;
for
open
lawn
cover
with
verdure
as
smooth
as
velvet
,
but
much
more
lively
and
agreeable
;
for
pond
,
canal
,
basin
,
cascade
,
and
run
stream
of
water
;
for
clump
of
tree
,
wood
,
and
wilderness
,
cut
into
delightful
alley
,
perfume
with
honeysuckle
and
sweet-
briar
,
and
resound
with
the
mingle
melody
of
all
the
singing
bird
of
heaven
:
he
look
for
plat
of
flower
in
different
part
to
refresh
the
sense
,
and
please
the
fancy
;
for
arbour
,
grottos
,
hermitage
,
temple
,
and
alcove
,
to
shelter
him
from
the
sun
,
and
afford
him
mean
of
contemplation
and
repose
;
and
he
expect
to
find
the
hedge
,
grove
,
and
walk
,
and
lawn
keep
with
the
utmost
order
and
propriety
.
<EOS>
He
who
love
the
beauty
of
simple
nature
,
and
the
charm
of
neatness
will
seek
for
them
in
vain
amidst
the
grove
of
Italy
.
<EOS>
in
the
garden
of
the
Villa
Pinciana
,
there
be
a
plantation
of
four
hundred
pine
,
which
the
Italians
view
with
rapture
and
admiration
:
there
be
likewise
a
long
walk
,
of
tree
extend
from
the
garden
-
gate
to
the
palace
;
and
plenty
of
shade
,
with
alley
and
hedge
in
different
part
of
the
ground
:
but
the
grove
be
neglect
;
the
walk
be
lay
with
nothing
but
common
mould
or
sand
,
black
and
dusty
;
the
hedge
be
tall
,
thin
and
shabby
;
the
tree
stunt
;
the
open
ground
,
brown
and
parched
,
have
scarce
any
appearance
of
verdure
.
<EOS>
the
flat
,
regular
alley
of
evergreen
be
cut
into
fantastic
figure
;
the
flower
garden
embellish
with
thin
cypher
and
flourish
figure
in
box
,
while
the
flower
grow
in
row
of
earthen
-
pot
,
and
the
ground
appear
as
dusky
as
if
it
be
cover
with
the
cinder
of
a
blacksmith
's
forge
.
<EOS>
the
water
,
of
which
there
be
great
plenty
,
instead
of
be
collect
in
large
piece
,
or
convey
in
little
rivulet
and
stream
to
refresh
the
thirsty
soil
,
or
manage
so
as
to
form
agreeable
cascade
,
be
squirt
from
fountain
in
different
part
of
the
garden
,
through
tube
little
big
than
common
glyster
-
pipe
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
own
indeed
that
the
fountain
have
their
merit
in
the
way
of
sculpture
and
architecture
;
and
that
here
be
a
great
number
of
statue
which
merit
attention
:
but
they
serve
only
to
encumber
the
ground
,
and
destroy
that
effect
of
rural
simplicity
,
which
our
garden
be
design
to
produce
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
here
we
see
a
variety
of
walk
and
grove
and
fountain
,
a
wood
of
four
hundred
pine
,
a
paddock
with
a
few
meagre
deer
,
a
flower
-
garden
,
an
aviary
,
a
grotto
,
and
a
fish
-
pond
;
and
in
spite
of
all
these
particular
,
it
be
,
in
my
opinion
,
a
very
contemptible
garden
,
when
compare
to
that
of
Stowe
in
Buckinghamshire
,
or
even
to
those
of
Kensington
and
Richmond
.
<EOS>
the
Italians
understand
,
because
they
study
,
the
excellency
of
art
;
but
they
have
no
idea
of
the
beauty
of
nature
.
<EOS>
this
Villa
Pinciana
,
which
belong
to
the
borghese
family
,
would
make
a
complete
academy
for
painting
and
sculpture
,
especially
for
the
study
of
antient
marble
;
for
,
exclusive
of
the
statue
and
bust
in
the
garden
,
and
the
vast
collection
in
the
different
apartment
,
almost
the
whole
outside
of
the
house
be
cover
with
curious
piece
in
basso
and
alto
relievo
.
<EOS>
the
most
masterly
be
that
of
Curtius
on
horseback
,
leap
into
the
gulph
or
opening
of
the
earth
,
which
be
say
to
have
close
on
receive
this
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
among
the
exhibition
of
art
within
the
house
,
I
be
much
strike
with
a
Bacchus
,
and
the
death
of
Meleager
,
represent
on
an
antient
sepulchre
.
<EOS>
there
be
also
an
admirable
statue
of
Silenus
,
with
the
infant
Bacchus
in
his
arm
;
a
most
beautiful
gladiator
;
a
curious
Moor
of
black
marble
,
with
a
shirt
of
white
alabaster
;
a
finely
proportion
bull

be

<EOS>
let
us
likewise
own

for
the
honour
of
the

that
the

have
produce
two
fine

I

I
do
not
pretend
to
give
a
methodical
detail
of
the
curiosity
of
Rome
:
they
have
be
already
describe
by
different
author
,
who
be
much
better
qualified
than
I
be
for
the
talk
:
but
you
shall
have
what
observation
I
make
on
the
most
remarkable
object
,
without
method
,
just
as
they
occur
to
my
remembrance
;
and
I
protest
the
remark
be
all
my
own
:
so
that
if
they
deserve
any
commendation
,
I
claim
all
the
merit
;
and
if
they
be
impertinent
,
I
must
be
content
to
bear
all
the
blame
.
  
<EOS>
the
piazza
of
St
Peter
's
church
be
altogether
sublime
.
<EOS>
the
double
colonnade
on
each
side
extend
in
a
semi
-
circular
sweep
,
the
stupendous
aegyptian
obelisk
,
the
two
fountain
,
the
portico
,
and
the
admirable
facade
of
the
church
,
form
such
an
assemblage
of
magnificent
object
,
as
can
not
fail
to
impress
the
mind
with
awe
and
admiration
:
but
the
church
would
have
produce
a
still
great
effect
,
have
it
be
detach
entirely
from
the
building
of
the
Vatican
,
It
would
then
have
be
a
master
-
piece
of
architecture
,
complete
in
all
its
part
,
intire
and
perfect
:
<EOS>
whereas
,
at
present
,
it
be
no
more
than
a
beautiful
member
attach
to
a
vast
undigested
and
irregular
pile
of
building
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
architecture
of
this
famous
temple
,
I
shall
say
nothing
;
neither
do
I
pretend
to
describe
the
internal
ornament
.
<EOS>
the
great
picture
of
Mosaic
work
,
and
that
of
St
Peter
's
bark
toss
by
the
temp
,
which
appear
over
the
gate
of
the
church
,
though
rude
in
comparison
with
modern
piece
,
be
nevertheless
great
curiosity
,
when
consider
as
the
work
of
Giotto
,
who
flourish
in
the
beginning
of
the
fourteenth
century
.
<EOS>
His
master
be
Cimabue
,
who
learn
painting
and
architecture
of
the
grecian
artist
,
who
come
from
Constantinople
,
and
first
revive
these
art
in
Italy
.
<EOS>
but
,
to
return
to
St
Peter
's
,
I
be
not
at
all
pleased
with
the
famous
statue
of
the
dead
Christ
in
his
mother
's
lap
,
by
Michael
Angelo
.
<EOS>
the
figure
of
Christ
be
as
much
emaciate
,
as
if
he
have
die
of
a
consumption
:
besides
,
there
be
something
indelicate
,
not
to
say
indecent
,
in
the
attitude
and
design
of
a
man
's
body
,
stark
naked
,
lie
upon
the
knee
of
a
woman
.
<EOS>
here
be
some
good
picture
,
I
should
rather
say
copy
of
good
picture
,
do
in
Mosaic
to
great
perfection
;
particularly
a
St
Sebastian
by
Domenichino
,
and
Michael
the
Archangel
,
from
a
,
painting
of
Guido
Rheni
.
<EOS>
I
be
extremely
fond
of
all
this
artist
's
piece
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
tenderness
and
delicacy
in
his
manner
;
and
his
figure
be
all
exquisitely
beautiful
,
though
his
expression
be
often
erroneous
,
and
his
attitude
be
always
affected
and
unnatural
.
<EOS>
in
this
very
piece
the
archangel
have
all
the
air
of
a
french
dancing
-
master
;
and
I
have
see
a
Madonna
by
the
same
hand
,
I
think
it
be
in
the
Palazzo
di
Barberini
,
in
which
,
though
the
figure
be
enchanting
,
the
Virgin
be
represent
hold
up
the
drapery
of
the
infant
,
with
the
ridiculous
affectation
of
a
singer
on
the
stage
of
our
italian
opera
.
<EOS>
the
Mosaic
work
,
though
bring
to
a
wonderful
degree
of
improvement
,
and
admirably
calculate
for
church
,
the
dampness
of
which
be
pernicious
to
the
colour
of
the
pallet
,
I
will
not
yet
compare
to
the
production
of
the
pencil
.
<EOS>
the
glassyness
(
if
I
may
be
allow
the
expression
)
of
the
surface
,
throw
,
in
my
opinion
,
a
false
light
on
some
part
of
the
picture
;
and
when
you
approach
it
,
the
joining
of
the
piece
look
like
so
many
crack
on
paint
canva
.
<EOS>
besides
,
this
method
be
extremely
tedious
and
expensive
.
<EOS>
I
go
to
see
the
artist
at
work
,
in
a
house
that
stand
near
the
church
,
where
I
be
much
pleased
with
the
ingenuity
of
the
process
;
and
not
a
little
surprized
at
the
great
number
of
different
colour
and
tint
,
which
be
keep
in
separate
drawer
,
mark
with
number
as
far
as
seventeen
thousand
.
<EOS>
for
a
single
head
do
in
Mosaic
,
they
ask
me
fifty
zequine
.
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
the
church
.
<EOS>
the
altar
of
St
Peter
's
choir
,
notwithstanding
all
the
ornament
which
have
be
lavish
upon
it
,
be
no
more
than
a
heap
of
puerile
finery
,
better
adapt
to
an
indian
pagod
,
than
to
a
temple
build
upon
the
principle
of
the
greek
architecture
.
<EOS>
the
four
colossal
figure
that
support
the
chair
,
be
both
clumsy
and
disproportione
.
<EOS>
the
drapery
of
statue
,
whether
in
brass
or
stone
,
when
throw
into
large
masse
,
appear
hard
and
unpleasant
to
the
eye
and
for
that
reason
the
antient
always
imitate
wet
linen
,
which
exhibit
the
shape
of
the
limb
underneath
,
and
hang
in
a
multiplicity
of
wet
fold
,
give
an
air
of
lightness
,
softness
,
and
ductility
to
the
whole
.
  
<EOS>
these
two
statue
weigh
116,257
pound
,
and
as
they
sustain
nothing
but
a
chair
,
be
out
of
all
proportion
,
inasmuch
as
the
supporter
ought
to
be
suitable
to
the
thing
support
.
<EOS>
here
be
four
giant

old
wooden

we
may
believe
the
book
De

of
the
Identity

the
Roman
Chair

<EOS>
the
implement
of
popish
superstition
;
such
as
relick
of
pretended
saint
,
ill

proportion
spire
and
bellfrey
,
and
the
nauseous
repetition
of
the
figure
of
the
cross
,
which
be
in
itself
a
very
mean
and
disagreeable
object
,
only
fit
for
the
prison
of
condemn
criminal
,
have
contribute
to
introduce
a
vitious
taste
into
the
external
architecture
,
as
well
as
in
the
internal
ornament
of
our
temple
.
<EOS>
all
church
be
build
in
the
figure
of
a
cross
,
which
effectually
prevent
the
eye
from
take
in
the
scope
of
the
building
,
either
without
side
or
within
;
consequently
rob
the
edifice
of
its
proper
effect
.
<EOS>
the
palace
of
the
Escurial
in
Spain
be
lay
out
in
the
shape
of
a
gridiron
,
because
the
convent
be
build
in
consequence
of
a
vow
to
St
Laurence
,
who
be
broil
like
a
barbecued
pig
.
<EOS>
what
pity
it
be
,
that
the
labours
of
painting
should
have
be
so
much
employ
on
the
shocking
subject
of
the
martyrology
.
<EOS>
besides
numberless
picture
of
the
flagellation
,
crucifixion
,
and
descent
from
the
cross
,
we
have
Judith

Laurence

Bartholomew

and
a
hundred
other

equally
frightful
,
which
can
only
serve
to
fill
the
mind
with
gloomy
idea
,
and
encourage
a
spirit
of
religious
fanaticism
,
which

<EOS>
the
tribune
of
the
great
altar
,
consist
of
four
wreathed
brass
pillar
,
gilt

support
a
canopy
,
be
doubtless
very
magnificent
,
if
not
over
-
charge
with
sculpture
,
fluting

foliage
,
festoon

and
figure
of
boy
and
angel
,
which
,
with
the
hundred
and
twenty

two
lamp
of
silver

continually
burn
below
,
serve
rather
to
dazzle
the
eye
,
and
kindle
the
devotion
of
the
ignorant
vulgar
,
than
to
excite
the
admiration
of
a
judicious
observer
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
,
I
believe
,
in
this
famous
structure
,
so
worthy
of
applause
,
as
the
admirable
symmetry
and
proportion
of
its
part
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
the
carving
,
gilding
,
basso
relievos
,
medallion
,
urn
,
statue
,
column
,
and
picture
with
which
it
abound
,
it
do
not
,
on

whole
,
appear
over
-
croude
with
ornament
.
<EOS>
when
you
first
enter
,
your
eye
be
fill
so
equally
and
regularly
,
that
nothing
appear
stupendous
;
and
the
church
seem
considerably
small
than
it
really
be
.
<EOS>
the
statue
of
child
,
that
support
the
fount
of
holy
water
when
observe
from
the
door
,
seem
to
be
of
the
natural
size
;
but
as
you
draw
near
,
you
perceive
they
be
gigantic
.
<EOS>
in
the
same
manner
,
the
figure
of
the
dove
,
with
olive
branch
in
their
beak
,
which
be
represent
on
the
wall
,
appear
to
be
within
your
reach
;
but
as
you
approach
them
,
they
recede
to
a
considerable
height
,
as
if
they
have
fly
upwards
to
avoid
be
take
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
much
disappointed
at
sight
of
the
Pantheon
,
which
,
after
all
that
have
be
say
of
it
,
look
like
a
huge
cockpit
,
open
at
top
.
<EOS>
the
portico
which
Agrippa
add
to
the
building
,
be
undoubtedly
very
noble
,
though
,
in
my
opinion
,
it
correspond
but
ill
with
the
simplicity
of
the
edifice
.
<EOS>
with
all
my
veneration
for
the
antient
,
I
can
not
see
in
what
the
beauty
of
tile
rotunda
consist
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
more
than
a
plain
unpierced
cylinder
,
or
circular
wall
,
with
two
fillet
and
a
cornice
,
have
a
vaulted
roof
or
cupola
,
open
in
the
centre
.
<EOS>
I
mean
the
original
building
,
without
consider
the
vestibule
of
Agrippa
.
<EOS>
within
side
it
have
much
the
air
of
a
mausoleum
.
<EOS>
It
be
this
appearance
which
,
in
all
probability
,
suggest
the
thought
to
Boniface
IV
to
transport
hither
eight
and
twenty
cart
-
load
of
old
rotten
bone
,
dig
from
different
burying
-
place
,
and
then
dedicate
it
as
a
church
to
the
blessed
Virgin
and
all
the
holy
martyr
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
one
of
those
who
think
it
be
well
light
by
the
hole
at
the
top
,
which
be
about
nine
and
twenty
foot
in
diameter
,
although
the
author
of
the
Grand
Tour
call
it
but
nine
.
<EOS>
the
same
author
say
,
there
be
a
descent
of
eleven
step
to
go
into
it
;
that
it
be
a
hundred
and
forty
-
four
foot
in
heighth
,
and
as
many
in
breadth
;
that
it
be
cover
with
copper
,
which
,
with
the
brass
nail
of
the
portico
,
pope
urban
VIII
take
away
,
and
convert
into
the
four
wreathed
pillar
that
support
the
canopy
of
the
high
altar
in
the
church
of
St
Peter
,
&
<EOS>
c.
the
truth
be
,
before
the
time
of
pope
Alexander
VII
,
the
earth
be
so
raise
as
to
cover
part
of
the
temple
,
and
there
be
a
descent
of
some
step
into
the
porch
:
but
that
pontiff
order
the
ground
to
be
pare
away
to
the
very
pedestal
or
base
of
the
portico
,
which
be
now
even
with
the
street
,
so
that
there
be
no
descent
whatsoever
.
<EOS>
the
height
be
two
hundred
palmi
,
and
the
breadth
two
hundred
and
eighteen
;
which
,
reckon
fife
palmi
at
nine
inch
,
will
bring
the
height
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
,
and
the
breadth
to
one
hundred
and
sixty
-
three
foot
six
inch
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
any
covering
of
copper
which
pope
urban
VIII
remove
,
but
large
brass
beam
,
which
support
the
roof
of
the
portico
.
<EOS>
They
weigh
186,392
pound
;
and
afford
metal
enough
not
only
for
the
pillar
in
St
Peter
's
church
,
but
also
for
several
piece
of
artillery
that
be
now
in
the
castle
of
St
Angelo
.
<EOS>
what
be
more
extraordinary
,
the
gilding
of
those
column
be
say
to
have
cost
forty
thousand
golden
crown
:
sure
money
be
never
bad
lay
out
.
<EOS>
urban
VIII
likewise
add
two
bellfrey
tower
to
the
rotunda
;
and
I
wonder
he
do
not
cover
the
central
hole
with
glass
,
as
it
must
be
very
inconvenient
and
disagreeable
to
those
who
go
to
church
below
,
to
be
expose
to
the
rain
in
wet
weather
,
which
must
also
render
it
very
damp
and
unwholesome
.
<EOS>
I
visit
it
several
time
,
and
each
time
it
look
more
and
more
gloomy
and
sepulchral
.
  
<EOS>
the
magnificence
of
the
Romans
be
not
so
conspicuous
in
their
temple
,
as
in
their
theatre
,
amphitheatre
,
circusse
,
naumachia
,
aqueduct
,
triumphal
arch
,
portico
,
basilicae
,
but
especially
their
thermae
,
or
bathing
-
place
.
<EOS>
a
great
number
of
their
temple
be
small
and
inconsiderable
;
not
one
of
them
be
comparable
either
for
size
or
magnificence
,
to
the
modern
church
of
St
Peter
of
the
Vatican
.
<EOS>
the
famous
temple
of
Jupiter
Capitolinus
be
neither
half
so
long
,
nor
half
so
broad
:
<EOS>
it
be
but
two
hundred
foot
in
length
,
and
one
hundred
and
eighty
-
five
in
breadth
;
whereas
the
length
of
St
Peter
's
extend
to
six
hundred
and
thirty
-
eight
foot
,
and
the
breadth
to
above
five
hundred
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
near
twice
as
large
as
the
temple
of
Jupiter
Olympius
in
Greece
,
which
be
count
one
of
the
seven
wonder
of
the

I
shall
take
another

explain
myself
further
on
the
antiquity
of

a
subject
,
upon
which
I
be
dispose
to
be
(
perhaps
impertinently
)
circumstantial

DEAR
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
the
Colossaeum
or
amphitheatre
build
by
Flavius
Vespasian
,
be
the
most
stupendous
work
of
the
kind
which
antiquity
can
produce
.
<EOS>
near
one
half
of
the
external
circuit
still
remain
,
consist
of
four
tire
of
arcade
,
adorn
with
column
of
four
order
,
Doric
,
Ionic
,
Corinthian
,
and
Composite
.
<EOS>
the
height
and
extent
of
it
may
be
guess
from
the
number
of
spectator
it
contain
,
amount
to
one
hundred
thousand
;
and
yet
,
accord
to
Fontana
's
mensuration
,
it
could
not
contain
above
thirty
-
four
thousand
person
sit
,
allow
a
foot
and
an
half
for
each
person
:
for
the
circuit
of
the
whole
building
do
not
exceed
one
thousand
five
hundred
and
sixty
foot
.
<EOS>
the
amphitheatre
at
Verona
be
one
thousand
two
hundred
and
ninety
foot
in
circumference
;
and
that
of
Nismes
,
one
thousand
and
eighty
.
<EOS>
the
Colossaeum
be
build
by
Vespasian
,
who
employ
thirty
thousand
jewish
slave
in
the
work
;
but
finish
and
dedicate
by
his
son
Titus
,
who
,
on
the
first
day
of
its
be
open
,
produce
fifty
thousand
wild
beast
,
which
be
all
kill
in
the
arena
.
<EOS>
the
Romans
be
undoubtedly
a
barbarous
people
,
who
delight
in
horrible
spectacle
.
<EOS>
They
view
with
pleasure
the
dead
body
of
criminal
drag
through
the
street
,
or
throw
down
the
Scalae
Gemoniae
and
tarpeian
rock
,
for
their
contemplation
.
<EOS>
Their
rostra
be
generally
adorn
with
the
head
of
some
remarkable
citizen
,
like
Temple
-
Bar
,
at
London
.
<EOS>
They
even
bear
the
sight
of
Tully
's
head
fix
upon
that
very
rostrum
where
he
have
so
often
ravish
their
ear
with
all
the
charm
of
eloquence
,
in
plead
the
cause
of
innocence
and
public
virtue
.
<EOS>
They
take
delight
in
see
their
fellow
-
creature
tear
in
piece
by
wild
beast
,
in
the
amphitheatre
.
<EOS>
They
shout
with
applause
when
they
see
a
poor
dwarf
or
slave
kill
by
his
adversary
;
but
their
transport
be
altogether
extravagant
,
when
the
devoted
captive
be
oblige
to
fight
in
troop
,
till
one
side
be
entirely
butcher
by
the
other
.
<EOS>
Nero
produce
four
hundred
senator
,
and
six
hundred
of
the
equestrian
order
,
as
gladiator
in
the
public
arena
:
even
the
woman
fight
with
wild
beast
,
as
well
as
with
each
other
,
and
drench
the
amphitheatre
with
their
blood
.
<EOS>
Tacitus
say
,
"
sed
faeminarum
illustrium
,
senatorumque
filiorum
plure
per
arenam
faedati
sunt
,
"
"
but
many
son
of
senator
,
and
even
Matrons
of
the
first
Rank
,
expose
themselves
in
this
vile
exercise
.
"
<EOS>
the
execrable
custom
of
sacrifice
captive
or
slave
at
the
tomb
of
their
master
and
great
man
,
which
be
still
preserve
among
the
negro
of
Africa
,
obtain
also
among
the
antient
,
Greeks
as
well
as
Romans
.
<EOS>
I
could
never
,
without
horror
and
indignation
,
read
that
passage
in
the
twenty
-
third
book
of
the
Iliad
,
which
describe
twelve
valiant
Trojan
captive
sacrifice
by
the
inhuman
Achilles
at
the
tomb
of
his
friend
Patroclus

<EOS>
twelve

with

<EOS>
even
Virgil
make
his
pious
Hero
sacrifice
eight
italian
youth
to
the
mane
of
Pallas
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
at
all
clear
to
me
,
that
a
people
be
the
more
brave
,
the
more
they
be
accustomed
to
bloodshe
in
their
public
entertainment
.
<EOS>
true
bravery
be
not
savage
but
humane
.
<EOS>
some
of
this
sanguinary
spirit
be
inherit
by
the
inhabitant
of
a
certain
island
that
shall
be
nameless
 
<EOS>
but
,
mum
for
that
.
<EOS>
You
will
naturally
suppose
that
the
Coliseo
be
ruin
by
the
barbarian
who
sack
the
city
of
Rome
:
in
effect
,
they
rob
it
of
its
ornament
and
valuable
material
;
but
it
be
reserve
for
the
Goths
and
Vandals
of
modern
Rome
,
to
dismantle
the
edifice
,
and
reduce
it
to
its
present
ruinous
condition
.
<EOS>
one
part
of
it
be
demolish
by
pope
Paul
II
that
he
may
employ
the
stone
of
it
in
build
the
palace
of
St
Mark
.
<EOS>
It
be
afterwards
dilapidated
for
the
same
purpose
,
by
the
cardinal
Riarius
and
Farnese
,
which
last
assume
the
tiara
under
the
name
of
Paul
III
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
these
injury
,
there
be
enough
stand
to
convey
a
very
sublime
idea
of
ancient
magnificence
.
  
<EOS>
the
Circi
and
Naumachia
,
if
consider
as
building
and
artificial
basin
,
be
admirable
;
but
if
examine
as
areae
intend
for
horse
and
chariot
race
,
and
artificial
sea
for
exhibit
naval
engagement
,
they
seem
to
prove
that
the
antient
Romans
be
but
indifferently
skilled
and
exercise
either
in
horsemanship
or
naval
armament
.
<EOS>
the
inclosure
of
the
emperor
Caracalla
's
circus
be
still
stand
,
and
scarce
afford
breathing
room
for
an
english
hunter
.
<EOS>
the
Circus
Maximus
,
by
far
the
large
in
Rome
,
be
not
so
long
as
the
Mall
;
and
I
will
venture
to
affirm
,
that
St
James
's
Park
would
make
a
much
more
ample
and
convenient
scene
for
those
diversion
.
<EOS>
I
imagine
an
old
Roman
would
be
very
much
surprised
to
see
an
english
race
on
the
course
at
New
-
Market
.
<EOS>
the
Circus
Maximus
be
but
three
hundred
yard
in
breadth
.
<EOS>
a
good
part
of
this
be
take
up
by
the
spina
,
or
middle
space
,
adorn
with
temple
,
statue
,
and
two
great
obelisk
;
as
well
as
by
the
euripus
,
or
canal
,
make
by
order
of
Julius
Caesar
,
to
contain
crocodile
,
and
other
aquatic
animal
,
which
be
kill
occasionally
.
<EOS>
this
be
so
large
,
that
Heliogabalus
,
have
fill
it
with
excellent
wine
,
exhibit
naval
engagement
in
it
,
for
the
amusement
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
It
surround
three
side
of
the
square
,
so
that
the
whole
extent
of
the
race
do
not
much
exceed
an
english
mile
;
and
when
Probus
be
at
the
expence
of
fill
the
plain
of
it
with
fir
-
tree
to
form
a
wood
for
the
chace
of
wild
beast
,
I
question
much
if
this
forest
be
more
extensive
than
the
plantation
in
St
James
's
Park
,
on
the
south
side
of
the
canal
:
now
I
leave
you
to
judge
what
ridicule
a
king
of
England
would
incur
by
convert
this
part
of
the
park
into
a
chace
for
any
specie
of
animal
which
be
count
game
in
our
country
.
  
<EOS>
the
roman
emperor
seem
more
disposed
to
elevate
and
surprize
,
than
to
conduct
the
public
diversion
accord
to
the
rule
of
reason
and
propriety
.
<EOS>
one
would
imagine
,
it
be
with
this
view
they
institute
their
naumachia
,
or
naval
engagement
,
perform
by
half
a
dozen
small
gallie
of
a
side
in
an
artificial
basin
of
fresh
water
.
<EOS>
these
gallie
I
suppose
be
not
so
large
as
common
fishing
-
smack
,
for
they
be
move
by
two
,
three
,
and
four
oar
of
a
side
accord
to
their
different
rate
,
bireme
,
trireme
,
and
quadrireme
.
<EOS>
I
know
this
be
a
knotty
point
not
yet
determine
;
and
that
some
antiquarian
believe
the
roman
gallie
have
different
tire
or
deck
of
oar
;
but
this
be
a
notion
very
ill
support
,
and
quite
contrary
to
all
the
figure
of
them
that
be
preserve
on
antient
coin
and
medal
.
<EOS>
Suetonius
in
the
reign
of
Domitian
,
speak
of
these
naumachia
,
say
,
"
Edidit

He
exhibit
naval
engagement
of
almost
intire
fleet
,
in
an
artificial
Lake
form
for
the
purpose
hard
by
the
Tyber
,
and
view
them
in
the
midst
of
excessive
rain
.
<EOS>
"
this
artificial
lake
be
not
large
than
the
piece
of
water
in
Hyde
-
Park
;
and
yet
the
historian
say
,
it
be
almost
large
enough
for
real
or
intire
fleet
.
<EOS>
how
would
a
british
sailor
relish
an
advertisement
that
a
mock
engagement
between
two
squadron
of
man
of
war
would
be
exhibit
on
such
a
day
in
the
Serpentine
river
?
<EOS>
or
that
the
ship
of
the
line
take
from
the
enemy
would
be
carry
in
procession
from
Hyde
-
Park
-
Corner
to
tower
-
wharf
?
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
Lucullus
,
in
one
of
his
triumph
,
have
one
hundred
and
ten
ship
of
war
<EOS>
(
nave
longas
)
carry
through
the
street
of
Rome
.
<EOS>
nothing
can
give
a
more
contemptible
idea
of
their
naval
power
,
than
this
testimony
of
their
historian
,
who
declare
that
their
seaman
or
mariner
be
form
by
exercise
small
row
-
boat
in
an
inclosed
pool
of
fresh
water
.
<EOS>
have
they
not
the
sea
within
a
few
mile
of
them
,
and
the
river
Tyber
run
through
their
capital
!
<EOS>
even
this
would
have
be
much
more
proper
for
exercise
their
waterman
,
than
a
pond
of
still
-
water
,
not
much
large
than
a
cold
-
bath
.
<EOS>
I
do
believe
in
my
conscience
that
half
a
dozen
english
frigate
would
have
be
able
to
defeat
both
the
contend
fleet
at
the
famous
battle
of
Actium
,
which
have
be
so
much
celebrate
in
the
annal
of
antiquity
,
as
an
event
that
decide
the
fate
of
empire
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
employ
me
a
whole
month
to
describe
the
thermae
or
bath
,
the
vast
ruin
of
which
be
still
to
be
see
within
the
wall
of
Rome
,
like
the
remain
of
so
many
separate
citadel
.
<EOS>
the
thermae
Dioclesianae
may
be
term
an
august
academy
for
the
use
and
instruction
of
the
roman
people
.
<EOS>
the
pinacotheca
of
this
building
be
a
complete
musaeum
of
all
the
curiosity
of
art
and
nature
;
and
there
be
public
school
for
all
the
science
.
<EOS>
if
I
may
judge
by
my
eye
,
however
,
the
thermae
Antonianae
build
by
Caracalla
,
be
still
more
extensive
and
magnificent
;
they
contain
cell
sufficient
for
two
thousand
three
hundred
person
to
bathe
at
one
time
,
without
be
see
by
one
another
.
<EOS>
They
be
adorn
with
all
the
charm
of
painting
,
architecture
,
and
sculpture
.
<EOS>
the
pipe
for
convoy
the
water
be
of
silver

<EOS>
many

the

precious

illuminate

<EOS>
among
the

<EOS>
bathing
be
certainly
necessary
to
health
and
cleanliness
in
a
hot
country
like
Italy
,
especially
before
the
use
of
linen
be
know

but
these
purpose
would
have
be
much
better
answer
by
plunge
into
the
Tyber

than
by
use
the
warm
bath
in
the
thermae

which
become
altogether
a

effeminate
Asiatics

debilitate
the

<EOS>
true
it
be

they

bath
of
cool
water
for
the
summer

but
in
general
they
use
it
milk

and
often
perfume

they
likewise
indulge
in
vapour

bath

in
order
to
enjoy
a

likewise
improve

<EOS>
the
bathing
time
be
from
noon
till
the
evening
,
when
the
Romans
eat
their
principal
meal
.
<EOS>
Notice
be
give
by
a
bell
,
or
some
such
instrument
,
when
the
bath
be
open
,
as
we
learn
from
Juvenal
,
  
Redde

the
Bath
Bell
ring
 
<EOS>
what
,
still
play
on
?
<EOS>
perhaps
the
maid
in
private
rub
you
down
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
separate
place
for
the
two
sex
;
and
indeed
there
be
bath
open
for
the
use
of
woman
only
,
at
the
expence
of
Agrippina
,
the
mother
of
Nero
,
and
some
other
matron
of
the
first
quality
.
<EOS>
the
use
of
bathing
be
become
so
habitual
to
the
constitution
of
the
Romans
,
that
Galen
,
in
his
book
De
Sanitate
tuenda
,
mention
a
certain
philosopher
,
who
,
if
he
intermit
but
one
day
in
his
bathing
,
be
certainly
attack
with
a
fever
.
<EOS>
in
order
to
preserve
decorum
in
the
bath
,
a
set
of
law
and
regulation
be
publish
,
and
the
thermae
be
put
under
the
inspection
of
a
censor
,
who
be
generally
one
of
the
first
senator
in
Rome
.
<EOS>
Agrippa
leave
his
garden
and
bath
,
which
stand
near
the
pantheon
,
to
the
roman
people
:
among
the
statue
that
adorn
them
be
that
of
a
youth
naked
,
as
go
into
the
bath
,
so
elegantly
form
by
the
hand
of
Lysippus
,
that
Tiberius
,
be
strike
with
the
beauty
of
it
,
order
it
to
be
transfer
into
his
own
palace
:
but
the
populace
raise
such
a
clamour
against
him
,
that
he
be
fain
to
have
it
reconveye
to
its
former
place
.
<EOS>
these
noble
bath
be
restore
by
Adrian
,
as
we
read
in
Spartian
;
but
at
present
no
part
of
them
remain
.
  
<EOS>
with
respect
to
the
present
state
of
the
old
aqueduct
,
I
can
give
you
very
little
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
I
only
see
the
ruin
of
that
which
convey
the
aqua
Claudia
,
near
the
Porta
Maggiore
,
and
the
Piazza
of
the
Lateran
.
<EOS>
You
know
there
be
fourteen
of
those
antient
aqueduct
,
some
of
which
bring
water
to
Rome
from
the
distance
of
forty
mile
.
<EOS>
the
channel
of
them
be
large
enough
to
admit
a
man
arm
on
horseback
;
and
therefore
when
Rome
be
besiege
by
the
Goths
,
who
have
cut
off
the
water
,
Belisarius
fortify
them
with
work
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
enter
the
city
by
those
conveyance
.
<EOS>
after
that
period
,
I
suppose
the
antient
aqueduct
continue
dry
,
and
be
suffer
to
run
to
ruin
.
<EOS>
without
all
doubt
,
the
Romans
be
greatly
oblige
to
those
benefactor
,
who
raise
such
stupendous
work
for
the
benefit
,
as
well
as
the
embellishment
of
their
city
:
but
it
may
have
be
supply
with
the
same
water
through
pipe
at
one
hundredth
part
of
the
expence
;
and
in
that
case
the
enemy
would
not
have
find
it
such
an
easy
matter
to
cut
it
off
.
<EOS>
those
pope
who
have
provide
the
modern
city
so
plentifully
with
excellent
water
,
be
much
to
be
commend
for
the
care
and
expence
,
they
have
bestow
in
restore
the
stream
call
acqua
Virgine
,
acqua
Felice
,
and
acqua
Paolina
,
which
afford
such
abundance
of
water
as
would
plentifully
supply
a
much
large
city
than
modern
Rome
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
no
wonder
that
M
Agrippa
,
the
son
-
in
-
law
,
friend
,
and
favourite
of
Augustus
,
should
at
the
same
time
have
be
the
idol
of
the
people
,
consider
how
surprisingly
he
exert
himself
for
the
emolument
,
convenience
,
and
pleasure
of
his
fellow
-
citizen
.
<EOS>
It
be
he
who
first
conduct
this
acqua
Virgine
to
Rome
:
he
form
seven
hundred
reservoir
in
the
city
;
erect
one
hundred
and
five
fountain
;
one
hundred
and
thirty
castella
,
or
conduit
,
which
work
he
adorn
with
three
hundred
statue
,
and
four
hundred
pillar
of
marble
,
in
the
space
of
one
year
.
<EOS>
He
also
bring
into
Rome
,
the
aqua
Julia
,
and
restore
the
aqueduct
of
the
aqua
Marzia
,
which
have
fall
to
decay
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
observe
the
great
number
of
bath
which
he
open
for
the
people
,
and
the
magnificent
thermae
,
with
spacious
garden
,
which
he
bequeath
to
them
as
a
legacy
.
<EOS>
but
these
benefaction
,
great
and
munificent
as
they
seem
to
be
,
be
not
the
most
important
service
he
perform
for
the
city
of
Rome
.
<EOS>
the
common
-
sewer
be
first
make
by
order
of
Tarquinius
Priscus
,
not
so
much
with
a
view
to
cleanliness
,
as
by
way
of
subterranean
drain
to
the
Velabrum
,
and
in
order
to
carry
off
the
stagnant
water
,
which
remain
in
the
low
part
,
after
heavy
rain
.
<EOS>
the
different
branch
of
these
channel
unite
at
the
Forum
,
from
whence
by
the
cloaca
Maxima
,
their
content
be
convey
into
the
Tyber
.
<EOS>
this
great
cloaca
be
the
work
of
Tarquinius
Superbus
.
<EOS>
other
sewer
be
add
by
Marcus
Cato
,
and
Valerius
Flaccus
,
the
censor
.
<EOS>
all
these
drain
have
be
choake
up
and
ruinous
,
be
clear
and
restore
by
Marcus
Agrippa
,
who
likewise
undermine
the
whole
city
with
canal
of
the
same
kind
,
for
carry
of
the
filth
;
he
strengthen
and
enlarge
the
cloaca
maxima
,
so
as
to
make
it
capable
of
receive
a
large
cart
load
with
hay
;
and
direct
seven
stream
of
water
into
these
subterranean
passage
,
in
order
to
keep
them
always
clean
and
open
.
<EOS>
if
,
notwithstanding
all
these
convenience
,
Vespasian
be
put
to
great
expence
in
remove
the
ordure
from
the
public
street
,
we
have
certainly
a
right
to
conclude
that
the
antient
Romans
be
not
more
cleanly
than
the
modern
Italians
.
  
<EOS>
after
the
mausolea
of
Augustus
,
and
Adrian
,
which
I
have
already
mention
,
the
most
remarkable
antient
sepulchre
at

<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
you
must
not
imagine
I
see
one
half
of
the
valuable
picture
and
statue
of
Rome
;
there
be
such
a
vast
number
of
both
in
this
capital
,
that
I
may
have
spend
a
whole
year
in
take
even
a
transient
view
of
them
;
and
,
after
all
,
some
of
them
would
have
be
overlook
.
<EOS>
the
most
celebrated
piece
,
however
,
I
have
see
;
and
therefore
my
curiosity
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
if
I
have
the
nice
discernment
and
delicate
sensibility
of
a
true
connoisseur
,
this
superficial
glimpse
would
have
serve
only
to
whet
my
appetite
,
and
to
detain
me
the
whole
winter
at
Rome
.
<EOS>
in
my
progress
through
the
Vatican
,
I
be
much
pleased
with
the
School
of
Athens
,
by
Raphael
,
a
piece
which
hath
suffer
from
the
dampness
of
the
air
.
<EOS>
the
four
boy
attend
to
the
demonstration
of
the
mathematician
be
admirably
varied
in
the
expression
.
<EOS>
Mr
Webb
's
criticism
on
this
artist
be
certainly
just
.
<EOS>
He
be
perhaps
the
good
ethic
painter
that
ever
the
world
produce
.
<EOS>
no
man
ever
express
the
sentiment
so
happily
,
in
visage
,
attitude
,
and
gesture
:
but
he
seem
to
have
have
too
much
phlegm
to
strike
off
the
grand
passion
,
or
reach
the
sublime
part
of
painting
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
serenity
of
Virgil
,
but
want
the
fire
of
Homer
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
in
his
Parnassus
which
strike
me
,
but
the
ludicrous
impropriety
of
Apollo
's
playing
upon
a
fiddle
,
for
the
entertainment
of
the
nine
muse
.
<EOS>
[
upon
well
information
I
must
retract
this
censure
;
in
as
much
,
as
I
find
there
be
really
a
Musical
Instrument
among
the
antient
of
this
figure
,
as
appear
by
a
small
statue
in
Bronze
,
to
be
still
see
in
the
Florentine
Collection
.
]
  
<EOS>
the
last
judgment
,
by
Buonaroti
,
in
the
chapel
of
Sixtus
IV
produce
to
my
eye
the
same
sort

<EOS>
I
be
pleased
with
the
strength
of
expression
,
exhibit
in
single
figure
,
and
separate
groupe
:
<EOS>
but
,
the
whole
together
be
a
mere
mob
,
without
subordination
,
keeping
,
or
repose
.
<EOS>
a
painter
ought
to
avoid
all
subject
that
require
a
multiplicity
of
groupe
and
figure
;
because
it
be
not
in
the
power
of
that
art
to
unite
a
great
number
in
one
point
of
view
,
so
as
to
maintain
that
dependence
which
they
ought

have
upon

another

Michael

have
have
very
little
idea

<EOS>
one
would
imagine
he
have
choose
his
king
,
hero

cardinal
,
and
prelate
,
from
among
the
facchini
of
Rome
:
that
he
really
draw
his

on
the
Cross
,
from
the
agony
of
some
vulgar
assassin
expire
on

<EOS>
in

thus
the

the

cruel

infamous

Charlemagne

which
stand

there

<EOS>
the
sleep
Cleopatra

you
enter
the

be
much
admired

but
I
be
better
pleased
with
the
Apollo

which
I
take
to
be
the
most
beautiful
statue
that
ever

<EOS>
the
Nile

which
lie

surmount

have
infinite
merit

be
much
damage

altogether
neglect

<EOS>
whether
it
be
the

describe

as
have
be

as

it
surpass
my
expectation

<EOS>
It
be
not
without
reason
that
Buonaroti
call
it
a
portentous
work
;
and
Pliny
have
do
it
no
more
than
justice
in
say
it
be
the
most
excellent
piece
that
ever
be
cut
in
marble
;
and
yet
the
famous
Fulvius
Ursini
be
of
opinion
that
this
be
not
the
same
statue
which
Pliny
describe
.
<EOS>
His
reason
,
mention
by
Montfaucon
,
be
these
.
<EOS>
the
statue
describe
by
Pliny
be
of
one
stone
;

these
be
not

<EOS>
Antonioli

the

<EOS>
be

it

the

honour

antiquity

<EOS>

nothing

that

likewise
those

what

me
infinitely
more
than

be
the

corinthian
brass

stand
in
the
middle

I

<EOS>
I
consider
the
trophy

a
very
curious
piece
of
sculpture
,
and
admire
the
two
sphinx
at
the
bottom
of
the
stair
lead
to
this
Piazza
,
as
the
only
good
specimen
of
design
I
have
ever
see
from
Aegypt
:
for
the
two
idol
of
that
country
,
which
stand
in
the
ground
floor
of
the
Musaeum
of
the
Capitol
,
and
indeed
all
the
aegyptian
statue
in
the
Camera
Aegyptiaca
of
this
very
building
,
be
such
monstrous
misrepresentation
of
nature
,
that
they
never
could
have
obtain
a
place
among
the
statue
of
Rome
,
except
as
curiosity
of
foreign
superstition
,
or
on
account
of
the
material
,
as
they
be
generally
of
basalte
,
porphyry
,
or
oriental
granite
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
farther
end
of
the
court
of
this
Musaeum

front
the
entrance
,
be
a
handsome
fountain
,
with
the
statue

no

than
the
famous
Marforio

so
call
from

be
find
in
Martis
Fore

<EOS>
It
be
remarkable
only
as
be
the
conveyance

the
answer
to
the
satire
which
be
find
paste
upon
Pasquin
,
another
mutilated
statue
,
stand
at
the
corner
of
a
street

<EOS>
the
marble
coffin
,
suppose
to
have
contain
the
ashe
of
Alexander
Severus
,
which
we
find
in
one
of
these
apartment
,
be
a
curious
antique
,
valuable
for
its
sculpture
in
basso
relievo
,
especially
for
the
figure
on
the
cover
,
representilig
that
emperor

his
mother
Julia
Mammea

be

six
class

a
temple
that

<EOS>
It
would
be
ridiculous

the
vast
collection

marble
,
basso

inscription

urn
,
bust

and
statue

which
be

<EOS>
I
see
them
but
once
,
and
then
I
be
strike
with
the
follow
particular
.
<EOS>
a
bacchanalian
drunk
;
a
Jupiter
and
Leda
,
at
least
equal
to
that
in
the
gallery
at
Florence
;
an
old
praesica
,
or
hire
mourner
,
very
much
resemble
those
wrinkle
hag
still
employ
in
Ireland
,
and
in
the
Highlands
of
Scotland
,
to
sing
the
coronach
at
funeral
,
in
praise
of
the
deceased
;
the
famous
Antinous
,
an
elegant
figure
,
which
Pousin
study
as
canon
or
rule
of
symmetry
;
the
two
faun
;
and
above
all
the
mirmillone
,
or
die
gladiator
;
the
attitude
of
the
body
,
the
expression
of
the
countenance
,
the
elegance
of
the
limb
,
and
the
swelling
of
the
muscle
,
in
this
statue
,
be
universally
admire
;
but
the
execution
of
the
back
be
incredibly
delicate
.
<EOS>
the
course
of
the
muscle
call
longissimi
dorsi
,
be
so
naturally
mark
and
tenderly
execute
,
that
the
marble
actually
emulate
the
softness
of
the
flesh
;
and
you
may
count
all
the
spine
of
the
vertebrae
,
raise
up
the
skin
as
in
the
live
body
;
yet
this
statue
,
with
all
its
merit
,
seem
inferior
to
the
celebrated
die
gladiator
of
Ctesilas
,
as
describe
by
Pliny
,
who
say
the
expression
of
it
be
such
,
as
appear
altogether
incredible
.
<EOS>
in
the
court
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
Capitol
,
there
be
an
admirable
statue
of
a
lion
devour
an
horse
,
which
be
find
by
the
gate
of
Ostia
,
near
the
pyramid
of
Caius
Cestius
;
and
here
on
the
left
hand
,
under
a
colonade
,
be
what
they
call
the
Columna
Rostrata
,
erect
in
honour
of
Caius
Duilius
,
who
first
triumph
over
the
Carthaginians
by
sea
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
a
modern
pillar
,
with
the
old
inscription
,
which
be
so
defaced
as
not
to
be
legible
.
<EOS>
among
the
picture
in
the
gallery
and
saloon
above
,
what
please
me
most
be
the
Bacchus
and
Ariadne
of
Guido
Rheni
;
and
the
wolf
suckle
Romulus
and
Remus
,
by
Rubens
.
<EOS>
the
court
of
the
Palazzo
Farnese
be
surround
with
antique
statue
,
among
which
the
most
celebrated
be
,
the
Flora
,
with
a
most
delicate
drapery
;
the
gladiator
,
with
a
dead
boy
over
his
shoulder
;
the
Hercules
,
with
the
spoil
of
the
nemean
lion
,
but
that
which
the
connoisseur
justly
esteem
above
all
the
rest
be
hercule
,
by
Glycon
,
which
you
know
as
well
as
I
do
,
by
the
great
reputation
it
have
acquire
.
<EOS>
this
admirable
statue
have
be
find
without
the
leg
,
these
be
supply
by
Gulielmo
de
la
Porta
<EOS>
so
happily
,
that
when
afterwards
the
original
limb
be
discover
,
Michael
Angelo
prefer
those
of
the
modern
artist
,
both
in
grace
and
proportion
;
and
they
have
be
retain
accordingly
.
<EOS>
in
a
little
house
,
or
shed
,
behind
the
court
,
be
preserve
the
wonderful
group
of
Dirce
,
commonly
call
the
Toro
Farnese
,
which
be
bring
hither
from
the
thermae
Caracallae
.
<EOS>
there
be
such
spirit
,
ferocity
,
and
indignant
resistance
express
in
the
bull
,
to
whose
horn
Dirce
be
tie
by
the
hair
,
that
I
have
never
see
anything
like
it
,
either
upon
canvass
,
or
in
stone
.
<EOS>
the
statue
of
the
two
brother
endeavour
to
throw
him
into
the
sea
be
beautiful
figure
,
finely
contrast
;
and
the
rope
,
which
one
of
them
hold
in
a
sort
of
loose
coil
,
be
so
surprisingly
chizzelle
,
that
one
can
hardly
believe
it
be
of
stone
.
<EOS>
as
for
Dirce
herself
,
she
seem
to
be
but
a
subaltern
character
;
there
be
a
dog
upon
his
hind
leg
bark
at
the
bull
,
which
be
much
admired
.
<EOS>
this
amazing
groupe
be
cut
out
of
one
stone
,
by
Appollonius
and
Tauriscus
,
two
sculptor
of
Rhodes
;
and
be
mention
by
Pliny
in
the
thirty-
sixth
book
of
his
Natural
History
.
<EOS>
all
the
precious
monument
of
art
,
which
have
come
down
to
us
from
antiquity
,
be
the
production
of
greek
artist
.
<EOS>
the
Romans
have
taste
enough
to
admire
the
art
of
Greece
,
as
plainly
appear
by
the
great
collection
they
make
of
their
statue
and
picture
,
as
well
as
by
adopt
their
architecture
and
musick
:
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
remember
to
have
read
of
any
Roman
who
make
a
great
figure
either
as
a
painter
or
a
statuary
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
enough
to
say
those
profession
be
not
honourable
in
Rome
,
because
painting
,
sculpture
,
and
musick
,
even
rhetoric
,
physic
,
and
philosophy
be
practise
and
teach
by
slave
.
<EOS>
the
art
be
always
honour
and
revere
at
Rome
,
even
when
the
professor
of
them
happen
to
be
slave
by
the
accident
and
iniquity
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
the
business
of
painting
and
statuary
be
so
profitable
,
that
in
a
free
republic
,
like
that
of
Rome
,
they
must
have
be
greedily
embrace
by
a
great
number
of
individual
:
but
,
in
all
probability
,
the
roman
soil
produce
no
extraordinary
genius
for
those
art
.
<EOS>
like
the
English
of
this
day
,
they
make
a
figure
in
poetry
,
history
,
and
ethic
;
but
the
excellence
of
painting
,
sculpture
,
architecture
,
and
music
,
they
never
could
attain
.
<EOS>
in
the
Palazzo
Picchini
I
see
three
beautiful
figure
,
the
celebrated
statue
of
Meleager
,
the
boar
,
and
dog
;
together
with
a
wolf
,
of
excellent
workmanship
.
<EOS>
the
celebrated
statue
of
Moses
,
by
Michael
Angelo
,
in
the
church
of
St
Peter
in
Vincula
,
I
beheld
with
pleasure
;
as
well
as
that
of
Christ
,
by
the
same
hand
,
in
the
Church
of
S
Maria
sopra
Minerva
.
<EOS>
the
right
foot
,
cover
with
bronze
,
gilt

be
much
kiss
by
the
devotee
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
be
look
upon
as
a
specific
for
the
toothache
;
for
,
I
see
a
cavalier
,
in
year
,
and
an
old
woman
successively
rub
their
gum
upon
it
,
with
the
appearance
of
the
most
painful
perseverance
.
  
<EOS>
You
need
not
doubt
but
that
I
go
to
the
church
of
St
Peter
in
Montorio
,
to
view
the
celebrated
transfiguration
,
by
Raphael
,
which
,
if
it
be
mine
,
I
would
cut
in
two
part
.
<EOS>
the
three
figure
in
the
air
attract
the
eye
so
strongly
,
that
little
or
no
attention
be
pay
to
those
below
on
the
mountain
.
<EOS>
I
apprehend
that
the
nature
of
the
subject
do
not
admit
of
that
keeping
and
dependence
,
which
ought
to
be
maintain
in
the
disposition
of
the
light
and
shadow
in
a
picture
.
<EOS>
the
groupe
seem
to
be
intirely
independent
of
each
other
.
<EOS>
the
extraordinary
merit
of
this
piece
,
I
imagine
,
consist
,
not
only
in
the
expression
of
divinity
on
the
face
of
Christ
;
but
also
in
the
surprising
lightness
of
the
figure
,
<EOS>
that
hover
like
a
beautiful
exhalation
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
in
the
church
of
St
Luke
,
I
be
not
at
all
strike
by
the
picture
of
that
saint
,
draw
the
portrait
of
the
Virgin
Mary
,
although
it
be
admire
as
one
of
the
good
piece
of
Raphael
.
<EOS>
indeed
it
make
so
little
impression
upon
me
,
that
I
do
not
even
remember
the
disposition
of
the
figure
.
<EOS>
the
altar
-
piece
,
by
Andrea
Sacchi
,
in
the
church
of
St
Romauldus
,
would
have
more
merit
,
if
the
figure
of
the
saint
himself
have
more
consequence
,
and
be
represent
in
a
strong
light
.
<EOS>
in
the
Palazzo
Borghese
,
I
chiefly
admire
the
follow
piece
:
a
Venus
with
two
nymph
;
and
another
with
Cupid
,
both
by
Titian
:
an
excellent
roman
Piety
,
by
Leonardo
da
Vinci
;
and
the
celebrated
Muse
,
by
Dominechino
,
which
be
a
fine
,
jolly
,
buxom
figure
.
<EOS>
at
the
palace
of
Colorina
Connestabile
,
I
be
charm
with
the
Herodias
,
by
Guido
Rheni
;
a
young
Christ
;
and
a
Madonna
,
by
Raphael
;
and
four
landscape
,
two
by
Claude
Lorraine
,
and
the
other
two
,
by
Salvator
Rosa
.
<EOS>
in
the
palazetto
,
or
summerhouse
belong
to
the
Palazzo
Rospigliosi
,
I
have
the
satisfaction
of
contemplate
the
Aurora
of
Guido
,
the
colour
of
which
still
remain
in
high
perfection
,
notwithstanding
the
common
report
that
the
piece
be
spoil
by
the
dampness
of
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
the
print
of
this
picture
,
by
Freij
,
with
all
its
merit
,
convey
but
an
imperfect
idea
of
the
beauty
of
the
original
.
<EOS>
in
the
Palazzo
Barberini
,
there
be
a
great
collection
of
marble
and
picture
:
among
the
first
,
I
be
attract
by
a
beautiful
statue
of
Venus
;
a
sleep
faun
,
of
curious
workmanship
;
a
charming
Bacchus
,
lie
on
an
antient
sculpture
,
and
the
famous
Narcissus
.
<EOS>
of
the
picture
,
what
give
me
most
pleasure
be
the
Magdalen
of
Guido
,
infinitely
superior
to
that
by
Le
Brun
in
the
church
of
the
Carmelites
at
Paris
;
the
Virgin
,
by
Titian
;
a
Madonna
,
by
Raphael
,
but
not
comparable
to
that
which
be
in
the
Palazzo
de
Pitti
,
at
Florence
;
and
the
death
of
Germanicus
,
by
Poussin
,
which
I
take
to
be
one
of
the
good
piece
in
this
great
collection
.
<EOS>
in
the
Palazzo
Falconeri
there
be
a
beautiful
St
Cecilia
,
by
Guercino
;
a
holy
family
,
by
Raphael
;
and
a
fine
expressive
figure
of
St
Peter
weeping
,
by
Dominechino
.
<EOS>
in
the
Palazzo
Altieri
,
I
admire
a
picture
,
by
Carlo
Maratti
,
represent
a
saint
call
down
lightning
from
heaven
to
destroy
blasphemer
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
figure
of
the
saint
I
admire
,
merely
as
a
portrait
.
<EOS>
the
execution
of
the
other
part
be
tame
enough
:
perhaps
they
be
purposely
keep
down
,
in
order
to
preserve
the
importance
of
the
principal
figure
.
<EOS>
I
imagine
Salvator
Rosa
would
have
make
a
different
disposition
on
the
same
subject
:
that
amidst
the
darkness
of
a
temp
,
he
would
have
illuminate
the
blasphemer
with
the
flash
of
lightning
by
which
he
be
destroy
:
this
would
have
throw
a
dismal
gleam
upon
his
countenance
,
distort
by
the
horror
of
his
situation
as
well
as
by
the
effect
of
the
fire
;
and
render
the
whole
scene
dreadfully
picturesque
.
<EOS>
in
the
same
palace
,
I
see
the
famous
holy
family
,
by
Corregio
,
which
he
leave
unfinished
,
and
no
other
artist
would
undertake
to
supply
;
for
what
reason
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
here
too
be
a
judgment
of
Paris
,
by
Titian
,
which
be
reckon
a
very
valuable
piece
.
<EOS>
in
the
Palazzo
Odescalchi
,
there
be
a
holy
family
,
by
Buonaroti
,
and
another
by
Raphael
,
both
count
excellent
,
though
in
very
different
stile
,
extremely
characteristic
of
those
two
great
rival
artist
.
  
<EOS>
if
I
be
silly
enough
to
make
a
parade
,
I
may
mention
some
hundred
more
of
marble
and
picture
,
which
I
really
see
at
Rome
;
and
even
eke
out
that
number
with
a
huge
list
of
those
I
do
not
see
:
but
whatever
vanity
I
may
have
,
it
have
not
take
this
turn
;
and
I
assure
you
,
upon
my
word
and
honour
,
I
have
describe
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
actually
fall
under
my
own
observation
.
<EOS>
as
for
my
critical
remark
,
I
be
afraid
you
will
think
them
too
superficial
and
capricious
to
belong

<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
I
have
nothing
to
communicate
touch
the
library
of
the
Vatican
,
which
,
with
respect
to
the
apartment
and
their
ornament
,
be
undoubtedly
magnificent
.
<EOS>
the
number
of
book
it
contain
do
not
exceed
forty
thousand
volume
,
which
be
all
conceal
from
the
view
,
and
lock
up
in
press
:
as
for
the
manuscript
,
I
see
none
but
such
as
be
commonly
present
to
stranger
of
our
nation
;
some
very
old
copy
of
Virgil
and
Terence
;
two
or
three
missal
,
curiously
illuminate
;
the
book
De
Septem
Sacramentis
,
write
in
Latin
by
Henry
VIII
against
Luther
;
and
some
of
that
prince
's
love
letter
to
Anne
Boleyn
.
<EOS>
I
likewise
visit
the
Libreria
Casanatense
,
belong
to
the
convent
of
the
church
call
S
Maria
Sopra
Minerva
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
recommendation
to
the
principal
librarian
,
a
dominican
friar
,
who
receive
me
very
politely
,
and
regale
me
with
a
sight
of
several
curious
ms
of
the
classic
.
  
<EOS>
have
satisfy
my
curiosity
at
Rome
,
I
prepare
for
my
departure
,
and
as
the
road
between
Radicofani
and
Montefiascone
be
very
stony
and
disagreeable
,
I
ask
the
banker
Barazzi
,
if
there
be
not
a
well
way
of
return
to
Florence
,
express
a
desire
at
the
same
time
to
see
the
cascade
of
Terni
.
<EOS>
He
assure
me
that
the
road
by
Terni
be
forty
mile
short
than
the
other
,
much
more
safe
and
easy
,
and
accommodate
with
exceed
good
auberge
.
<EOS>
have
I
take
the
trouble
to
cast
my
eye
upon
the
map
<EOS>
,
I
must
have
see
,
that
the
road
by
Terni
,
instead
of
be
forty
mile
short
,
be
much
long
than
the
other
:
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
the
only
mistake
of
Signiore
Barazzi
.
<EOS>
great
part
of
this
way
lie
over
steep
mountain
,
or
along
the
side
of
precipice
,
which
render
travel
in
a
carriage
exceed
tedious
,
dreadful
,
and
dangerous
;
and
as
for
the
public
house
,
they
be
in
all
respect
the
most
execrable
that
ever
I
enter
.
<EOS>
I
will
venture
to
say
that
a
common
prisoner
in
the
Marshalsea
or
King's
-
Bench
be
more
cleanly
and
commodiously
lodged
than
we
be
in
many
place
on
this
road
.
<EOS>
the
house
be
abominably
nasty
,
and
generally
destitute
of
provision
:
when
eatable
be
find
,
we
be
almost
poison
by
their
cookery
:
their
bed
be
without
curtain
or
bedstead
,
and
their
window
without
glass
;
and
for
this
sort
of
entertainment
we
pay
as
much
as
if
we
have
be
genteelly
lodge
,
and
sumptuously
treat
.
<EOS>
I
repeat
it
again
;
of
all
the
people
I
ever
know
,
the
Italians
be
the
most
villainously
rapacious
.
<EOS>
the
first
day
,
have
pass
Civita
Castellana
,
a
small
town
stand
on
the
top
of
a
hill
,
we
put
up
at
what
be
call
an
excellent
inn
,
where
cardinal
,
prelate
,
and
prince
,
often
lodge
.
<EOS>
be
meagre
day
,
there
be
nothing
but
bread
,
egg
,
and
anchovy
,
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
go
to
bed
without
supper
,
and
lie
in
a
pallet
,
where
I
be
half
devour
by
vermin
.
<EOS>
next
day
,
our
road
,
in
some
place
,
lie
along
precipice
,
which
over
-
hang
the
Nera

Nar

celebrate
in
antiquity
for
its
white
foam

sulphureous
quality
of
its
water

<EOS>
Sulfurea

<EOS>
It
be
a

but
rapid
stream
,
which
run
not
far
from
hence
,
into
the
Tyber
.
<EOS>
pass
Utricoli
,
near
the
ruin
of
the
ancient
Ocriculum
,
and
the
romantic
town
of
Narni
,
situate
on
the
top
of
a
mountain
,
in
the
neighbourhood
of
which
be
still
see
stand
one
arch
of
the
stupendous
bridge
build
by
Augustus
Caesar
<EOS>
,
we
arrive
at
Terni
,
and
hire
a
couple
of
chaise
before
dinner
,
go
to
see
the
famous
Cascata
delle
Marmore
,
which
be
at
the
distance
of
three
mile
.
<EOS>
We
ascend
a
steep
mountain
by
a
narrow
road
form
for
a
considerable
way
along
the
brink
of
a
precipice
,
at
the
bottom
of
which
brawl
the
furious
river
Nera
,
after
have
receive
the
Velino

<EOS>
this

be
the
stream

,
run
from
the
Lago
delle
Marmore
,
form
the
cascade
by
fall
over
a
precipice
about
one
hundred
and
sixty
foot
high
.
<EOS>
such
a
body
of
water
rush
down
the
mountain
;
the
smoak
,
vapour
,
and
thick
white
mist
which
it
raise
;
the
double
rainbow
which
these
particle
continually
exhibit
while
the
sun
shine
;
the
deafen
sound
of
the
cataract
;
the
vicinity
of
a
great
number
of
other
stupendous
rock
and
precipice
,
with
the
dashing
,
boiling
,
and
foam
of
the
two
river
below
,
produce
altogether
an
object
of
tremendous
sublimity
:
yet
great
part
of
its
effect
be
lose
,
for
want
of
a
proper
point
of
view
,
from
which
it
may
be
contemplate
.
<EOS>
the
cascade
would
appear
much
more
astonishing
,
be
it
not
in
some
measure
eclipse
by
the
superior
height
of
the
neighbouring
mountain
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
a
front
perspective
;
but
be
oblige
to
view
it
obliquely
on
one
side
,
stand
upon
the
brink
of
a
precipice
,
which
can
not
be
approach
without
horror
.
<EOS>
this
station
may
be
render
much
more
accessible
,
and
altogether
secure
,
for
the
expence
of
four
or
five
zequine
;
and
a
small
tax
may
be
levy
for
the
purpose
from
traveller
by
the
aubergiste
at
Terni
,
who
let
his
calasse
for
half
a
zequine
a
piece
to
those
that
be
curious
to
see
this
phaenomenon
.
<EOS>
besides
the
two
postilion
whom
I
pay
for
this
excursion
,
at
the
rate
of
one
stage
in
post

there
be
a
fellow
who
post
himself
behind
one
of
the
chaise
,
by
way
of
go
to
point
out
the
different
view
of
the
cascade
;
and
his
demand
amount
to
four
or
five
paul
.
<EOS>
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
extortion
of
those
villainous
publican
,
I
must
tell
you
that
for
a
dinner
and
supper
,
which
even
hunger
could
not
tempt
us
to
eat
,
and
a
night
's
lodging
in
three
truckle
bed
<EOS>
,
I
pay
eighty
paul
,
amount
to
forty
shilling
sterling
.
<EOS>
You
ask
me
why
I
submit
to
such
imposition
?
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
 
I
have
more
than
once
in
my
travel
make
a
formal
complaint
of
the
exorbitancy
of
a
publican
,
to
the
magistrate
of
the
place
;
but
I
never
receive
any
satisfaction
,
and
have
lose
abundance
of
time
.
<EOS>
have
I
proceed
to
manual
correction
,
I
should
have
alarm
and
terrify
the
woman
:
have
I
peremptorily
refuse
to
pay
the
sum
total
,
the
landlord
,
who
be
the
post
-
master
,
would
not
have
supply
me
with
horse
to
proceed
on
my
journey
.
<EOS>
I
try
the
experiment
at
Muy
in
France
,
where
I
put
myself
into
a
violent
passion
,
have
abundance
of
trouble
,
be
detain
till
it
be
almost
night
,
and
after
all
find
myself
oblige
to
submit
,
furnish
at
the
same
time
matter
of
infinite
triumph
to
the
mob
,
which
have
surround
the
coach
,
and
interest
themselves
warmly
in
favour
of
their
townsman
.
<EOS>
if
some
young
patriot
,
in
good
health
and
spirit
,
would
take
the
trouble
as
often
as
he
be
impose
upon
by
the
road
in
travel
,
to
have
recourse
to
the
fountain

head
,
and
prefer
a
regular
complaint
to
the
comptroller
of
the
post
,
either
in
France
or
Italy
,
he
would
have
ample
satisfaction
,
and
do
great
service
to
the
community

<EOS>
Terni
be

pretty
well

<EOS>
in
our
journey
from

we
pass
over
a
high
mountain

(
call

Somma

<EOS>
where
it
be
necessary

wind
along

<EOS>
which
be

through
part

of

on

We

in

I
perceive
one

desire
it

declare
with

he
reply
,
"

an

I

make

if

<EOS>
next
day
,
we
cross
the
Tyber
,
over
a
handsome
bridge
,
and
in
mount
the
steep
hill
upon
which
the
city
of
Perugia
stand
,
our
horse
be
exhaust
,
be
drag
backwards
by
the
weight
of
the
carriage
to
the
very
edge
of
a
precipice
,
where
,
happily
for
us
,
a
man
pass
that
way
,
place
a
large
stone
behind
one
of
the
wheel
,
which
stop
their
motion
,
otherwise
we
should
have
be
all
dash
in
piece
.
<EOS>
We
have
another
ugly
hill
to
ascend
within
the
city
,
which
be
more
difficult
and
dangerous
than
the
other
:
but
the
postilion
,
and
the
other
beast
make
such
effort
,
that
we
mount
without
the
least
stop
,
to
the
summit
,
where
we
find
ourselves
in
a
large
piazza
,
where
the
horse
be
always
change
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
relay
at
the
post
,
we
be
oblige
to
stay
the
whole
day
and
night
at
Perugia
,
which
be
a
considerable
city
,
build
upon
the
acclivity
of
a
hill
,
adorn
with
some
elegant
fountain
,
and
several
handsome
church
,
contain
some
valuable
picture
by
Guido
,
Raphael
,
and
his
master
Pietro
Perugino
,
who
be
a
native
of
this
place
.
<EOS>
the
next
stage
be
on
the
bank
of
the
lake
,
which
be
the
Thrasimene
of
the
antient
,
a
beautiful
piece
of
water
,
above
thirty
mile
in
circumference
,
have
three
island
,
abound
with
excellent
fish
:
upon
a
peninsula
of
it
,
there
be
a
town
and
castle
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
this
neighbourhood
where
the
consul
Flaminius
be
totally
defeat
with
great
slaughter
by
Hannibal
.
<EOS>
from
Perugia
to
Florence
,
the
post
be
all
double
,
and
the
road
be
so
bad
that
we
never
could
travel
above
eight
and
twenty
mile
a
day
.
<EOS>
We
be
often
oblige
to
quit
the
carriage
,
and
walk
up
steep
mountain
;
and
the
way
in
general
be
so
unequal
and
stony
,
that
we
be
jolt
even
to
the
danger
of
our
life
.
<EOS>
I
never
feel
any
sort
of
exercise
or
fatigue
so
intolerable
;
and
I
do
not
fail
to
bestow
an
hundred
benediction
per
diem
upon
the
banker
Barazzi
,
by
whose
advice
we
have
take
this
road
;
yet
there
be
no
remedy
but
patience
.
<EOS>
if
the
coach
have
not
be
incredibly
strong
,
it
must
have
be
shatter
to
piece
.
<EOS>
the
fifth
night
we
pass
at
a
place
call
Camoccia
,
a
miserable
cabaret
,
where
we
be
fain
to
cook
our
own
supper
,
and
lie
in
a
musty
chamber
,
which
have
never
know
a
fire
,
and
indeed
have
no
fire
-
place
,
and
where
we
run
the
risque
of
be
devour
by
rat
.
<EOS>
next
day
one
of
the
iron
of
the
coach
give
way
at
Arezzo
,
where
we
be
detain
two
hour
before
it
could
be
accommodate
.
<EOS>
I
may
have
take
this
opportunity
to
view
the
remain
of
the
antient
Etruscan
amphitheatre
.
<EOS>
and
the
temple
of
Hercules
,
describe
by
the
cavalier
Lorenzo
Guazzesi
,
as
stand
in
the
neighbourhood
of
this
place
:
but
the
blacksmith
assure
me
his
work
would
be
finish
in
a
few
minute
;
and
as
I
have
nothing
so
much
at
heart
as
the
speedy
accomplishment
of
this
disagreeable
journey
,
I
choose
to
suppress
my
curiosity
,
rather
than
be
the
occasion
of
a
moment
's
delay
.
<EOS>
but
all
the
night
we
have
hitherto
pass
be
comfortable
in
comparison
to
this
,
which
we
suffer
at
a
small
village
,
the
name
of
which
I
do
not
remember
.
<EOS>
the
house
be
dismal
and
dirty
beyond
all
description
;
the
bed
-
cloath
filthy
enough
to
turn
the
stomach
of
a
muleteer
;
and
the
victual
cook
in
such
a
manner
,
that
even
a
Hottentot
could
not
have
behold
them
without
loathe
.
<EOS>
We
have
sheet
of
our
own
,
which
be
spread
upon
a
mattrass
,
and
here
I
take
my
repose
wrap
in
a
greatcoat
,
if
that
could
be
call
repose
which
be
interrupt
by
the
innumerable
sting
of
vermin
.
<EOS>
in
the
morning
,
I
be
seize
with
a
dangerous
fit
of
hooping
-
cough
,
which
terrify
my
wife
,
alarm
my
people
,
and
bring
the
whole
community
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
have
undergo
just
such
another
at
Paris
,
about
a
year
before
.
<EOS>
this
forenoon
,
one
of
our
coach
wheel
fly
off
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Ancisa
,
a
small
town
,
where
we
be
detain
above
two
hour
by
this
accident
;
a
delay
which
be
productive
of
much
disappointment
,
danger
,
vexation
,
and
fatigue
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
horse
at
the
last
post
,
we
be
oblige
to
wait
until
those
which
bring
us
thither
be
sufficiently
refresh
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
understand
that
all
the
gate
of
Florence
be
shut
at
six
,
except
two
that
be
keep
open
for
the
accommodation
of
traveller
;
and
that
to
reach
the
near
of
these
gate
,
it
be
necessary
to
pass
the
river
Arno
in
a
ferry
-
boat
,
which
could
not
transport
the
carriage
;
I
determine
to
send
my
servant
before
with
a
light
chaise
to
enter
the
near
gate
before
it
be
shut
,
and
provide
a
coach
to
come
and
take
us
up
at
the
side
of
the
river
,
where
we
should
be
oblige
to
pass
in
the
boat
:
for
I
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
lie
another
night
in
a
common
cabaret
.
<EOS>
here
,
however
,
another
difficulty
occur
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
one
chaise
,
and
a
dragoon
officer
,
in
the
imperial
troop
,
insist
upon
his
have
bespeak
it
for
himself
and
his
servant
.
<EOS>
a
long
dispute
ensue
,
which
have
like
to
have
produce
a
quarrel
:
but
at
length
I
accommodate
matter
,
by
tell
the
officer
that
he
should
have
a
place
in
it
gratis
,
and
his
servant
may
ride
a
-
horse
-
back
.
<EOS>
He
accept
the
offer
without
hesitation
;
but
,
in
the
mean
time
,
we
set
out
in
the
coach
before
them
,
and
have
proceed
about
a
couple
of
mile
,
the
road
be
so
deep
from
a
heavy
rain
,
and
the
beast
be
so
fatigued
,
that
they
could
not
proceed
.
<EOS>
the
postilion
scourge
the
poor
animal
with
great
barbarity
,
they
make
an
effort
,
and
pull
the
coach
to
the
brink
of
a
precipice
,
or
rather
a
kind
of
hollow
-
way
,
which
may
be
about
seven
or
eight
foot
low
than
the
road
.
<EOS>
here
my
wife
and
I
leap
out
,
and
stand
under
the
rain
up
to
the
ancle
in
mud
;
while
the
postilion
still
exercise
their
whip
,
one
of
the
fore
-
horse
fairly
tumble
down
the
descent
,
arid
hang
by
the
neck
,
so
that
he
be
almost
strangle
before
he
could
be
disengage
from
the
trace
,
by
the
assistance
of
some
foot
traveller
that
happen
to
pass
.
<EOS>
while
we
remain
in
this
dilemma
,
the
chaise
,
with
the
officer
and
my
servant
,
come
up
,
we
exchange
place
;
my
wife
and
I
proceed
in
the
chaise
,
and
leave
them
with
Miss
C
  
and
Mr
R
 
,
to
follow
in
the
coach
.
<EOS>
the
road
from
hence
to
Florence
be
nothing
but
a
succession
of
steep
mountain
,
pave
and
conduct
in
such
a
manner
,
that
one
would
imagine
the
design
have
be
to
render
it
impracticable
by
any
sort
of
wheel
-
carriage
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
our
endeavour
,
I
find
it
would
be
impossible
to
enter
Florence
before
the
gate
be
shut
.
<EOS>
I
flatter
and
threaten
the
driver
by
turn
:
but
the
fellow
,
who
have
be
remarkably
civil
at
first
,
grow
sullen
and
impertinent
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
I
must
not
think
of
reach
Florence
:
that
the
boat
would
not
take
the
carriage
on
board
;
and
that
from
the
other
side
,
I
must
walk
five
mile
before
I
should
reach
the
gate
that
be
open
:
but
he
would
carry
me
to
an
excellent
osteria
,
where
I
should
be
entertain
and
lodge
like
a
prince
.
<EOS>
I
be
now
convinced
that
he
have
linger
on
purpose
to
serve
this
inn
-
keeper
;
and
I
take
it
for
grant
that
what
he
tell
me
of
the
distance
between
the
ferry
and
the
gate
be
a
lie
.
<EOS>
It
be
eight
o'clock
when
we
arrive
at
his
inn
.
<EOS>
I
alight
with
my
wife
to
view
the
chamber
,
desire
he
would
not
put
up
his
horse
.
<EOS>
find
it
be
a
villainous
house
,
we
come
forth
,
and
,
by
this
time
,
the
horse
be
put
up
.
<EOS>
I
ask
the
fellow
how
he
durst
presume
to
contradict
my
order
,
and
command
him
to
put
them
to
the
chaise
.
<EOS>
He
ask
in
his
turn
if
I
be
mad
?
<EOS>
if
I
think
I
and
the
lady
have
strength
and
courage
enough
to
walk
five
mile
in
the
dark
,
through
a
road
which
we
do
not
know
,
and
which
be
break
up
by
a
continue
rain
of
two
day
?
<EOS>
I
tell
him
he
be
an
impertinent
rascal
,
and
as
he
still
hesitate
,
I
collar
him
with
one
hand
,
and
shake
my
cane
over
his
head
with
the
other
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
only
weapon
I
have
,
either
offensive
or
defensive
;
for
I
have
leave
my
sword
,
and
musquetoon
in
the
coach
.
<EOS>
at
length
the
fellow
obey
,
though
with
great
reluctance
,
crack
many
severe
joke
upon
us
in
the
mean
time
,
and
be
join
in
his
raillery
by
the
inn
-
keeper
,
who
have
all
the
external
mark
of
a
ruffian
.
<EOS>
the
house
stand
in
a
solitary
situation
,
and
not
a
soul
appear
but
these
two
miscreant
,
so
that
they
may
have
murder
us
without
fear
of
detection
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
like
the
apartment
?
<EOS>
(
say
one
)
to
be
sure
they
be
not
fit
up
for
person
of
your
rank
and
quality
!
"
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
glad
of
a
bad
chamber
,
(
continue
the
other
)
before
you
get
to
bed
.
"
<EOS>
"
if
you
walk
to
Florence
tonight
,
you
will
sleep
so
sound
,
that
the
flea
will
not
disturb
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
take
care
<EOS>
you
do
not
take
up
your
night
's
lodging
in
the
middle
of
the
road
,
or
in
the
ditch
of
the
city
-
wall
.
<EOS>
"
I
fire
inwardly
at
these
sarcasm
,
to
which
,
however
,
I
make
no
reply
;
and
my
wife
be
almost
dead
with
fear
.
<EOS>
in
the
road
from
hence
to
the
boat
,
we
meet
with
an
ill
-
look
fellow
,
who
offer
his
service
to
conduct
us
into
the
city
,
and
such
be
our
situation
,
that
I
be
fain
to
accept
his
proposal
,
especially
as
we
have
two
small
box
in
the
chaise
by
accident
,
contain
some
cap
and
lace
belong
to
my
wife
<EOS>
,
I
still
hope
the
postilion
have
exaggerate
in
the
distance
between
the
boat
and
the
city
gate
,
and
be
confirm
in
this
opinion
by
the
ferryman
,
who
say
we
have
not
above
half
a
league
to
walk
.
<EOS>
Behold
us
then
in
this
expedition
;
myself
wrap
up
in
a
very
heavy
greatcoat
,
and
my
cane
in
my
hand
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
imagine
I
could
have
walk
a
couple
of
mile
in
this
equipage
,
have
my
life
be
depend
;
my
wife
a
delicate
creature
,
who
have
scarce
ever
walk
a
mile
in
her
life
;
and
the
ragamuffin
before
us
with
our
box
under
his
arm
.
<EOS>
the
night
be
dark
and
wet
;
the
road
slippery
and
dirty
;
not
a
soul
be
see
,
nor
a
sound
be
hear
:
all
be
silent
,
dreary
,
and
horrible
.
<EOS>
I
lay
my
account
with
a
violent
fit
of
illness
from
the
cold
<EOS>
I
should
infallibly
catch
,
if
I
escape
assassination
,
the
fear
of
which
be
the
more
troublesome
as
I
have
no
weapon
to
defend
our
life
.
<EOS>
while
I
labour
under
the
weight
of
my
greatcoat
which
make
the
stream
of
sweat
flow
down
my
face
and
shoulder
,
I
be
plunge
in
the
mud
,
up
to
the
mid
-
leg
at
every
step
;
and
at
the
same
time
oblige
to
support
my
wife
,
who
weep
in
silence
,
half
dead
with
terror
and
fatigue
.
<EOS>
to
crown
our
vexation
,
our
conductor
walk
so
fast
,
that
he
be
often
out
of
sight
,
and
I
imagine
he
have
run
away
with
the
box
.
<EOS>
all
I
could
do
on
these
occasion
,
be
to
hollow
as
loud
as
I
could
,
and
swear
horribly
that
I
would
blow
his
brain
out
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
but
these
oath
and
menace
may
keep
other
rogue
in
awe
.
<EOS>
in
this
manner
do
we
travel
three
long
mile
,
make
almost
an
intire
circuit
of
the
city
-
wall
,
without
see
the
face
of
a
human
creature
,
and
at
length
reach
the
gate
,
where
we
be
examine
by
the
guard
,
and
allow
to
pass
,
after
they
have
tell
us
it
be
a
long
mile
from
thence
to
the
house
of
Vanini
,
where
we
propose
to
lodge
.
<EOS>
no
matter
,
be
now
fairly
within
the
city
,
I
pluck
up
my
spirit
,
and
perform
the
rest
of
the
journey
with
such
ease
,
that
I
be
persuade
,
I
could
have
walk
at
the
same
pace
all
night
long
,
without
be
very
much
fatigue
.
<EOS>
It
be
near
ten
at
night
,
when
we
enter
the
auberge
in
such
a
draggled
and
miserable
condition
,
that
Mrs
Vanini
almost
faint
at
sight
of
us
,
on
the
supposition
that
we
have
meet
with
some
terrible
disaster
,
and
that
the
rest
of
the
company
be
kill
.
<EOS>
My
wife
and
I
be
immediately
accommodate
with
dry
stocking
and
shoe
,
a
warm
apartment
,
and
a
good
supper
,
which
I
eat
with
great
satisfaction
,
arise
not
only
from
our
have
happily
survive
the
adventure
,
but
also
from
a
conviction
that
my
strength
and
constitution
be
wonderfully
repair
:
<EOS>
not
but
that
I
still
expect
a
severe
cold
,
attend
with
a
terrible
fit
of
the
asthma
:
<EOS>
but
in
this
I
be
luckily
disappointed
.
<EOS>
I
now
for
the
first
time
drink
to
the
health
of
my
physician
Barazzi
,
fully
persuade
that
the
hardship
and
violent
exercise
I
undergo
by
follow
his
advice
,
have
greatly
contribute
to
the
re
-
establishment
of
my
health
.
<EOS>
in
this
particular
,
I
imitate
the
gratitude
of
Tavernier
,
who
be
radically
cure
of
the
gout
by
a
turkish
aga
in
Aegypt
,
who
give
him
the
bastinado
,
because
he
would
not
look
at
the
head
of
the
bashaw
of
Cairo
,
which
the
aga
have
in
a
bag
,
to
be
present
to
the
grand
signior
at
Constantinople
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
expect
to
see
the
rest
of
our
company
that
night
,
as
I
never
doubt
but
they
would
stay
with
the
coach
at
the
inn
on
the
other
side
of
the
Arno
:
but
at
mid
-
night
we
be
join
by
Miss
C
  
and
Mr
R
 
,
who
have
leave
the
carriage
at
the
inn
,
under
the
auspex
of
the
captain
and
my
servant
,
and
follow
our
foot
-
step
by
walk
from
the
ferry
-
boat
to
Florence
,
conduct
by
one
of
the
boatman
.
<EOS>
Mr
R
  
seem
to
be
much
ruffle
and
chagrin
;
but
,
as
he
do
not
think
proper
to
explain
the
cause
,
he
have
no
right
to
expect
that
I
should
give
him
satisfaction
for
some
insult
he
have
receive
from
my
servant
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
expose
to
a
variety
of
disagreeable
adventure
from
the
impracticability
of
the
road
.
<EOS>
the
coach
have
be
several
time
in
the
most
imminent
hazard
of
be
lose
with
all
our
baggage
;
and
at
one
place
,
it
be
necessary
to
hire
a
dozen
of
oxen
,
and
as
many
man
,
to
disengage
it
from
the
hole
into
which
it
have
run
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
confusion
of
these
adventure
,
that
the
captain
and
his
valet
,
Mr
R
  
and
my
servant
,
have
like
to
have
go
all
by
the
ear
together
.
<EOS>
the
peace
be
with
difficulty
preserve
by
the
interposition
of
Miss
C
 
,
who
suffer
incredibly
from
cold
and
wet
,
terror
,
vexation
,
and
fatigue
:
yet
happily
no
bad
consequence
ensue
.
<EOS>
the
coach
and
baggage
be
bring
safely
into
Florence
next
morning
,
when
all
of
us
find
ourselves
well
refresh
,
and
in
good
spirit
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
this
be
not
the
case
with
you
,
who
must
by
this
time
be
quite
jade
with
this
long
epistle
,
which
shall
therefore
be
close
without
further
ceremony
by

yours

NICE

<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
the
season
be
far
advanced
,
and
the
weather
grow
boisterous
,
I
make
but
a
short
stay
at
Florence
,
and
set
out
for
Pisa
,
with
full
resolution
to
take
the
near
road
to
Lerici
,
where
we
propose
to
hire
a
felucca
for
Genoa
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
desire
to
see
Leghorn
and
Lucca
;
but
the
dread
of
a
winter
's
voyage
by
sea
in
an
open
boat
effectually
restrain
my
curiosity
.
<EOS>
to
avoid
the
trouble
of
have
our
baggage
shift
every
post
,
I
hire
two
chaise
to
Pisa
for
a
couple
of
zequine
,
and
there
we
arrive
in
safety
about
seven
in
the
evening
,
though
not
without
fear
of
the
consequence
,
as
the
calesse
be
quite
open
,
and
it
rain
all
the
way
.
<EOS>
I
must
own
<EOS>
I
be
so
sick
of
the
wretched
accommodation
<EOS>
one
meet
with
in
every
part
of
Italy
,
except
the
great
city
,
so
averse
to
the
sea
at
this
season
,
and
so
fond
of
the
city
of
Pisa
,
that
I
should
certainly
have
stay
here
the
winter
,
<EOS>
have
not
I
be
separate
from
my
book
and
paper
,
as
well
as
from
other
conveniencie
and
connexion
which
I
have
at
Nice
;
and
foresee
that
the
thought
of
perform
the
same
disagreeable
voyage
in
the
spring
would
imbitter
my
whole
winter
's
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
I
again
hire
two
calesse
for
Lerici
,
propose
to
lie
at
Sarzana
,
three
mile
short
of
that
place
,
where
we
be
tell
we
should
find
comfortable
lodging
,
and
to
embark
next
day
without
halt
.
<EOS>
when
we
depart
in
the
morning
,
it
rain
very
hard
,
and
the
Cerchio
,
which
the
chaise
have
formerly
pass
,
almost
without
wet
the
wheel
,
be
now
swell
to
a
mighty
river
,
broad
and
deep
and
rapid
.
<EOS>
It
be
with
great
difficulty
I
could
persuade
my
wife
to
enter
the
boat
;
for
it
blow
a
storm
,
and
she
have
see
it
in
come
over
from
the
other
side
hurry
down
a
considerable
way
by
the
rapidity
of
the
current
,
notwithstanding
all
the
effort
of
the
waterman
.
<EOS>
near
two
hour
be
spend
in
transport
us
with
our
chaise
.
<EOS>
the
road
between
this
and
Pietra
Santa
be
render
almost
impassable
.
<EOS>
when
we
arrive
at
Massa
,
it
begin
to
grow
dark
,
and
the
post
-
master
assure
us
that
the
road
to
Sarzana
be
overflow
in
such
a
manner
as
not
to
be
pass
even
in
the
day
-
time
,
without
imminent
danger
.
<EOS>
We
therefore
take
up
our
lodging
for
the
night
at
this
house
,
which
be
in
all
respect
one
of
the
bad
we
have
yet
enter
.
<EOS>
next
day
,
we
find
the
Magra
as
large
and
violent
as
the
Cerchio
:
however
,
we
pass
it
without
any
accident
,
and
in
the
afternoon
arrive
at
Lerici
.
<EOS>
there
we
be
immediately
besiege
by
a
number
of
patron
of
feluccas
,
from
among
whom
I
choose
a
Spaniard
,
partly
because
he
look
like
an
honest
man
,
and
produce
an
ample
certificate
,
sign
by
an
english
gentleman
;
and
partly
,
because
he
be
not
an
Italian
;
for
,
by
this
time
,
I
have
imbibe
a
strong
prejudice
against
the
common
people
of
that
country
.
<EOS>
We
embark
in
the
morning
before
day
,
with
a
gale
that
make
us
run
the
lee
-
gunwale
in
the
water
;
but
,
when
we
pretend
to
turn
the
point
of
Porto
Venere
,
we
find
the
wind
full
in
our
tooth
,
and
be
oblige
to
return
to
our
quarter
,
where
we
have
be
shamefully
fleece
by
the
landlord
,
who
,
nevertheless
,
be
not
such
an
exorbitant
knave
as
the
post
-
master
,
whose
house
I
would
advise
all
traveller
to
avoid
.
<EOS>
here
,
indeed
,
I
have
occasion
to
see
an
instance
of
prudence
and
oeconomy
,
which
I
should
certainly
imitate
,
if
ever
I
have
occasion
to
travel
this
way
by
myself
.
<EOS>
an
Englishman
,
who
have
hire
a
felucca
from
Antibes
to
Leghorn
,
be
put
in
here
by
stress
of
weather
;
but
be
aware
of
the
extortion
of
innkeeper
,
and
the
bad
accommodation
in
their
house
,
he
sleep
on
board
on
his
own
mattrasse
;
and
there
likewise
he
have
all
his
conveniencie
for
eat
.
<EOS>
He
send
his
servant
on
shore
occasionally
to
buy
provision
,
and
see
it
cook
accord
to
his
direction
in
some
public
house
;
and
have
his
meal
regularly
in
the
felucca
.
<EOS>
this
evening
he
come
ashore
to
stretch
his
leg
,
and
take
a
solitary
walk
on
the
beach
,
avoid
us
with
great
care
,
although
he
know
we
be
English
;
his
valet
who
be
abundantly
communicative
,
tell
my
servant
,
that
in
come
through
France
,
his
master
have
travel
three
day
in
company
with
two
other
english
gentleman
,
whom
he
meet
upon
the
road
,
and
in
all
that
time
he
never
speak
a
word
to
either
,
yet
in
other
respect
,
he
be
a
good
man
,
mild
,
charitable
,
and
humane
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
character
truly
british
.
<EOS>
at
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
we
put
to
sea
again
,
and
though
the
wind
be
contrary
,
make
shift
to
reach
the
town
of
Sestri
di
Levante
,
where
we
be
most
graciously
receive
by
the
publican
butcher
and
his
family
.
<EOS>
the
house
be
in
much
well
order
than
before
;
the
people
be
much
more
obliging
;
we
pass
a
very
tolerable
night
,
and
have
a
very
reasonable
bill
to
pay
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
account
for
this
favourable
change
any
other
way
,
than
by
ascribe
it
to
the
effect
of
a
terrible
storm
,
which
have
two
day
before
tear
up
a
great
number
of
their
olive
-
tree
by
the
root
,
and
do
such
damage
as
terrify
them
into
humility
and
submission
.
<EOS>
next
day
,
the
water
be
delightful
,
we
arrive
by
one
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
at
Genoa
.
<EOS>
here
I
make
another
bargain
with
our
patron
Antonio
,
to
carry
us
to
Nice
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
hitherto
remarkably
oblige
,
and
seemingly
modest
.
<EOS>
He
speak
Latin
fluently
,
and
be
tincture
with
the
science
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
imagine
he
be
a
person
of
a
good
family
,
who
have
meet
with
misfortune
in
life
,
and
respect
him
accordingly
:
but
I
afterwards
find
him
mercenary
,
mean
,
and
rapacious
.
<EOS>
the
wind
be
still
contrary
,
when
we
depart
from
Genoa
,
we
could
get
no
further
than
Finale
,
where
we
lodge
in
a
very
dismal
habitation
,
which
be
recommend
to
us
as
the
good
auberge
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
what
render
it
the
more
uncomfortable
,
the
night
be
cold
,
and
there
be
not
a
fire
-
place
in
the
house
,
except
in
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
the
bed
(
if
they
deserve
that
name
)
be
so
shockingly
nasty
,
that
we
could
not
have
use
them
,
have
not
a
friend
of
Mr
R
  
supply
us
with
mattrasse
,
sheet
,
and
coverlet
;
for
our
own
sheet
be
on
board
the
felucca
,
which
be
anchor
at
a
distance
from
the
shore
.
<EOS>
Our
fare
be
equally
wretched
:
the
master
of
the
house
be
a
surly
assassin
,
and
his
cameriere
or
waiter
,
stark
-
stare
mad
.
<EOS>
Our
situation
be
at
the
same
time
shocking
and
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
Mr
R
  
quarrel
over
night
with
the
master
,
who
swear
in
break
French
to
my
man
,
that
he
have
a
good
mind
to
poniard
that
impertinent
Piedmontese
.
<EOS>
in
the
morning
,
before
day
,
Mr
R
 
,
come
into
my
chamber
,
give
me
to
understand
that
he
have
be
insult
by
the
landlord
,
who
demand
six
and
thirty
livre
for
our
supper
and
lodging
.
<EOS>
incense
at
the
rascal
's
presumption
,
I
assure
him
I
would
make
him
take
half
the
money
,
and
a
good
beating
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
He
reply
,
that
he
would
have
save
me
the
trouble
of
beat
him
,
have
not
the
cameriere
,
who
be
a
very
sensible
fellow
,
assure
him
the
padrone
be
out
of
his
sense
,
and
if
roughly
handle
,
may
commit
some
extravagance
.
<EOS>
though
I
be
exceedingly
ruffle
,
I
could
not
help
laugh
at
the
mad
cameriere
's
palm
himself
upon
r
 
y
,
as
a
sensible
fellow
,
and
transfer
the
charge
of
madness
upon
his
master
,
who
seem
to
be
much
more
knave
than
fool
.
<EOS>
while
Mr
R
  
go
to
mass
,
I
desire
the
cameriere
to
bid
his
master
bring
the
bill
,
and
to
tell
him
that
if
it
be
not
reasonable
,
I
would
carry
him
before
the
commandant
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
I
arm
myself
with
my
sword
in
one
hand
and
my
cane
in
the
other
.
<EOS>
the
inn
-
keeper
immediately
enter
,
pale
and
stare
,
and
when
I
demand
his
bill
,
he
tell
me
,
with
a
profound
reverence
that
he
should
be
satisfied
with
whatever
I
myself
think
proper
to
give
.
<EOS>
surprised
at
this
moderation
,
I
ask
if
he
should
be
content
with
twelve
livre
,
and
he
answer
,
"
contentissimo
,
"
with
another
prostration
.
<EOS>
then
he
make
an
apology
for
the
bad
accommodation
of
his
house
,
and
complain
,
that
the
reproach
of
the
other
gentleman
,
whom
he
be
pleased
to
call
my
majorduomo
,
have
almost
turn
his
brain
.
<EOS>
when
he
quit
the
room
,
his
cameriere
,
lay
hold
of
his
master
's
last
word
,
point
to
his
own
forehead
,
and
say
,
he
have
inform
the
gentleman
over
night
that
his
patron
be
mad
.
<EOS>
this
day
we
be
by
a
high
wind
in
the
afternoon
,
drive
for
shelter
into
Porto
Mauritio
,
where
we
find
the
post
-
house
even
bad
than
that
of
Finale
;
and
what
render
it
more
shocking
be
a
girl
quite
cover
with
the
confluent
smallpox
,
who
lie
in
a
room
through
which
it
be
necessary
to
pass
to
the
other
chamber
,
and
who
smell
so
strong
as
to
perfume
the
whole
house
.
<EOS>
We
be
but
fifteen
mile
from
St
Remo
,
where
I
know
the
auberge
be
tolerable
,
and
thither
I
resolve
to
travel
by
land
.
<EOS>
I
accordingly
order
five
mule
to
travel
post
,
and
a
very
ridiculous
cavalcade
we
form
,
the
woman
be
oblige
to
use
common
saddle
;
for
in
this
country
even
the

the
road
lie
along
one
continued
precipice

and
be
so
difficult
,
that
the
beast
never
could
exceed
a
walking
pace

<EOS>
in
some
place
we
be
oblige
to
alight
.
<EOS>
seven
hour
be
spend
in
travel
fifteen
short
mile
:
at
length
we
arrive
at
our
old
lodging
in
St
Remo
,
which
we
find
white
-
washed
,
and
in
great
order

<EOS>
We
sup
pretty
comfortably
;
sleep
well
;
and
have
no
reason
to
complain
of
imposition
in
pay
the
bill

<EOS>
this
be
not
the
case
in
the
article
of
the
mule
,
for
which
I
be
oblige
to
pay
fifty
livre
,
accord
to
the
regulation
of
the

<EOS>
the
postmaster
,
who
come
along

have
the
effrontery
to
tell

that
if
I
have
hire
the
mule
to
carry
me
and
my
company
to
St
Remo
,
in
the
way
of
common
travelling
,
they
would
have
cost
me
but
fifteen
livre
;
but
as
I
demand
post
-
horse
,
I
must
submit
to
the
regulation
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
distinction
the
more
absurd
,
as
the
road
be
of
such
a
nature
as
render
it
impossible
to

the

<EOS>
a

with

charge
me
three
livre
a
pound
for
whiting
,
and
if
question
about

reply

that
if
I

ask

fish
I
should
have
have
the

whiting

sell

Our

<EOS>
thus
have
I
give
you
a
circumstantial
detail
of
my
italian
expedition
,
during
which
I
be
expose
to
a
great
number
of
hardship
,
which
I
think
my
weaken
constitution
could
not
have
bear
;
as
well
as
to
violent
fit
of
passion
,
chequer
,
however
,
with
transport
of
a
more
agreeable
nature
;
<EOS>
insomuch
that
I
may
say
I
be
for
two
month
continually
agitate
either
in
mind
or
body
,
and
very
often
in
both
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
as
my
disorder
at
first
arise
from
a
sedentary
life
,
produce
a
relaxation
of
the
fibre
,
which
naturally
bring
on
a
listlessness
,
indolence
,
and
dejection
of
the
spirit
,
I
be
convinced
that
this
hard
exercise
of
mind
and
body
,
co
-
operated
with
the
change
of
air
and
object
,
to
brace
up
the
relaxed
constitution
,
and
promote
a
more
vigorous
circulation
of
the
juice
,
which
have
long
languish
even
almost
to
stagnation
.
<EOS>
for
some
year
,
I
have
be
as
subject
to
cold
as
a
delicate
woman
new
deliver

<EOS>
if
I
venture
to
go
abroad
when
there
be
the
least
moisture
either
in
the
air
,
or
upon
the
ground
,
I
be
sure
to
be
lay
up
a
fortnight
with
a
cough
and
asthma
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
this
journey
,
I
suffer
cold
and
rain
,
and
stand
,
and
walk
in
the
wet
,
heat
myself
with
exercise
,
and
sweat
violently
,
without
feel
the
least
disorder

but
,
on
the
contrary
,
feel
myself
grow
strong
every

in
the
midst
of
these
excess
.
<EOS>
since
my
return

,
it
have
rain
the
good
part
of
two
month
,
to
the
astonishment
of
all
the

yet
during
all
that
time
I
have
enjoy
good
health

<EOS>
on

NICE
,
March

<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
You
ask
whether
I
think
the
french
people
be
more
taxed
than
the
English
;
but
I
apprehend
,
the
question
would
be
more
apropos
if
you
ask
whether
the
french
taxis
be
more
insupportable
than
the
English
;
for
,
in
compare
burthen
,
we
ought
always
to
consider
the
strength
of
the
shoulder
that
bear
them
.
<EOS>
I
know
no
well
way
of
estimate
the
strength
,
than
by
examine
the
face
of
the
country
,
and
observe
the
appearance
of
the
common
people
,
who
constitute
the
bulk
of
every
nation
.
<EOS>
when
I
,
therefore
,
see
the
country
of
England
smile
with
cultivation
;
the
ground
exhibit
all
the
perfection
of
agriculture
,
parcel
out
into
beautiful
inclosure
,
cornfield
,
hay
and
pasture
,
woodland
and
common
,
when
I
see
her
meadow
well
stock
with
black
cattle
,
her
down
cover
with
sheep
;
when
I
view
her
team
of
horse
and
oxen
,
large
and
strong
,
fat
and
sleek
;
when
I
see
her
farm
-
house
the
habitation
of
plenty
,
cleanliness
,
and
convenience
;
and
her
peasant
well
fed
,
well
lodged
,
well
cloathed
,
tall
and
stout
,
and
hale
and
jolly
;
I
can
not
help
conclude
that
the
people
be
well
able
to
bear
those
imposition
which
the
public
necessity
have
render
necessary
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
when
I
perceive
such
sign
of
poverty
,
misery
and
dirt
,
among
the
commonalty
of
France
,
their
unfenced
field
dig
up
in
despair
,
without
the
intervention
of
meadow
or
fallow
ground
,
without
cattle
to
furnish
manure
,
without
horse
to
execute
the
plan
of
agriculture
;
their
farm
-
house
mean
,
their
furniture
wretche
,
their
apparel
beggarly
;
themselves
and
their
beast
the
image
of
famine
;
I
can
not
help
think
they
groan
under
oppression
,
either
from
their
landlord
,
or
their
government
;
probably
from
both
.
  
<EOS>
the
principal
imposition
of
the
french
government
be
these
:
<EOS>
first
,
the
taille
,
pay
by
all
the
common
,
except
those
that
be
privileged
:
secondly
,
the
capitation
,
from
which
no
person
(
not
even
the
noble
)
be
except
:
thirdly
,
the
tenth
and
twentieth
,
call
Dixiemes
and
Vingtiemes
,
which
every
body
pay
.
<EOS>
this
tax
be
originally
levy
as
an
occasional
aid
in
time
of
war
,
and
other
emergency
;
but
by
degree
be
become
a
stand
revenue
even
in
time
of
peace
.
<EOS>
all
the
money
arise
from
these
imposition
go
directly
to
the
king
's
treasury
;
and
must
undoubtedly
amount
to
a
very
great
sum
.
<EOS>
besides
these
,
he
have
the
revenue
of
the
farm
,
consist
of
the
droit
d'aydes
,
or
excise
on
wine
,
brandy
,
&
c.
of
the
custom
-
house
duty
;
of
the
gabelle
,
comprehend
that
most
oppressive
obligation
on
individual
to
take
a
certain
quantity
of
salt
at
the
price
which
the
farmer
shall
please
to
fix
;
of
the
exclusive
privilege
to
sell
tobacco
;
of
the
droit
de
controlle
,
insinuation
,
centieme
denier
,
franchief
,
aubeine
,
echange
et
contre
-
echange
arise
from
the
act
of
voluntary
jurisdiction
,
as
well
as
certain
law
-
suit
.
<EOS>
these
farm
be
say
to
bring
into
the
king
's
coffer
above
one
hundred
and
twenty
million
of
livre
yearly
,
amount
to
near
five
million
sterling
:
but
the
poor
people
be
say
to
pay
about
a
third
more
than
this
sum
,
which
the
farmer
retain
to
enrich
themselves
,
and
bribe
the
great
for
their
protection
;
which
protection
of
the
great
be
the
true
reason
why
this
most
iniquitous
,
oppressive
,
and
absurd
method
of
levy
money
be
not
lay
aside
.
<EOS>
over
and
above
those
article
I
have
mention
,
the
french
king
draw
considerable
sum
from
his
clergy
,
under
the
denomination
of
don
gratuit
,
or
free
-
gift
;
as
well
as
from
the
subsidy
give
by
the
pay
d'etats
such
as
Provence
,
Languedoc
,
and
Bretagne
,
which
be
exempt
from
the
taille
.
<EOS>
the
whole
revenue
of
the
french
king
amount
to
between
twelve
and
thirteen
million
sterle
.
<EOS>
these
be
great
resource
for
the
king
:
but
they
will
always
keep
the
people
miserable
,
and
effectually
prevent
them
from
make
such
improvement
as
may
turn
their
land
to
the
good
advantage
.
<EOS>
but
besides
be
ease
in
the
article
of
taxis
,
there
be
something
else
require
to
make
them
exert
themselves
for
the
benefit
of
their
country
.
<EOS>
They
must
be
free
in
their
person
,
secure
in
their
property
,
indulge
with
reasonable
lease
,
and
effectually
protect
by
law
from
the
insolence
and
oppression
of
their
superior
.
  
<EOS>
great
as
the
french
king
's
resource
may
appear
,
they
be
hardly
sufficient
to
defray
the
enormous
expence
of
his
government
.
<EOS>
about
two
million
sterle
per
annum
of
his
revenue
be
say
to
be
anticipate
for
pay
the
interest
of
the
public
debt
;
and
the
rest
be
find
inadequate
to
the
charge
of
a
prodigious
standing
army
,
a
double
frontier
of
fortified
town
and
the
extravagant
appointment
of
ambassador
,
general
,
governor
,
intendant
,
commandant
,
and
other
officer
of
the
crown
,
all
of
whom
affect
a
pomp
,
which
be
equally
ridiculous
and
prodigal
.
<EOS>
a
french
general
in
the
field
be
always
attend
by
thirty
or
forty
cook
;
and
think
it
be
incumbent
upon
him
,
for
the
glory
of
France
,
to
give
a
hundred
dish
every
day
at
his
table
.
<EOS>
when
don
Philip
,
and
the
marechal
duke
de
Belleisle
,
have
their
quarter
at
Nice
,
there
be
fifty
scullion
constantly
employ
in
the
great
square
in
plucking
poultry
.
<EOS>
this
absurd
luxury
infect
their
whole
army
.
<EOS>
even
the
commissary
keep
open
table
;
and
nothing
be
see
but
prodigality
and
profusion
.
<EOS>
the
king
of
Sardinia
proceed
upon
another
plan
.
<EOS>
His
troop
be
better
cloathe
,
better
pay
,
and
better
fed
than
those
of
France
.
<EOS>
the
commandant
of
Nice
have
about
four
hundred
a
year
of
appointment
,
which
enable
him
to
live
decently
,
and
even
to
entertain
stranger
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
the
commandant
of
Antibes
,
which
be
in
all
respect
more
inconsiderable
than
Nice
,
have
from
the
french
king
above
five
time
the
sum
to
support
the
glory
of
his
monarch
,
which
all
the
sensible
part
of
mankind
treat
with
ridicule
and
contempt
.
<EOS>
but
the
finance
of
France
be
so
ill
manage
,
that
many
of
their
commandant
,
and
other
officer
,
have
not
be
able
to
draw
their
appointment
these
two
year
.
<EOS>
in
vain
they
complain
and
remonstrate
.
<EOS>
when
they
grow
troublesome
they
be
remove
.
<EOS>
how
then
must
they
support
the
glory
of
France
?
<EOS>
how
,
but
by
oppress
the
poor
people
.
<EOS>
the
treasurer
make
use
of
their
money
for
his
own
benefit
.
<EOS>
the
king
know
it
;
he
know
his
officer
,
thus
defraud
,
fleece
and
oppress
his
people
:
but
he
think
proper
to
wink
at
these
abuse
.
<EOS>
that
government
may
be
say
to
be
weak
and
tottering
which
find
itself
oblige
to
connive
at
such
proceeding
.
<EOS>
the
king
of
France
,
in
order
to
give
strength
and
stability
to
his
administration
,
ought
to
have
sense
to
adopt
a
sage
plan
of
oeconomy
,
and
vigour
of
mind
sufficient
to
execute
it
in
all
its
part
,
with
the
most
rigorous
exactness
.
<EOS>
He
ought
to
have
courage
enough
to
find
fault
,
and
even
to
punish
the
delinquent
,
of
what
quality
soever
they
may
be
:
and
the
first
act
of
reformation
ought
to
be
a
total
abolition
of
all
the
farm
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
undoubtedly
,
many
mark
of
relaxation
in
the
rein
of
the
french
government
,
and
,
in
all
probability
,
the
subject
of
France
will
be
the
first
to
take
advantage
of
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
at
present
a
violent
fermentation
of
different
principle
among
them
,
which
under
the
reign
of
a
very
weak
prince
,
or
during
a
long
minority
,
may
produce
a
great
change
in
the
constitution
.
<EOS>
in
proportion
to
the
progress
of
reason
and
philosophy
,
which
have
make
great
advance
in
this
kingdom
,
superstition
lose
ground
;
antient
prejudice
give
way
;
a
spirit
of
freedom
take
the
ascendant
.
<EOS>
all
the
learned
laity
of
France
detest
the
hierarchy
as
a
plan
of
despotism
,
found
on
imposture
and
usurpation
.
<EOS>
the
protestant
,
who
be
very
numerous
in
southern
part
,
abhor
it
with
all
the
rancour
of
religious
fanaticism
.
<EOS>
many
of
the
common
,
enrich
by
commerce
and
manufacture
,
grow
impatient
of
those
odious
distinction
,
which
exclude
them
from
the
honour
and
privilege
due
to
their
importance
in
the
commonwealth
;
and
all
the
parliament
,
or
tribunal
of
justice
in
the
kingdom
,
seem
bent
upon
assert
their
right
and
independence
in
the
face
of
the
king
's
prerogative
,
and
even
at
the
expence
of
his
power
and
authority
.
<EOS>
Should
any
prince
therefore
be
seduce
by
evil
counsellor
,
or
mislead
by
his
own
bigotry
,
to
take
some
arbitrary
step
,
that
may
be
extremely
disagreeable
to
all
those
community
,
without
have
spirit
to
exert
the
violence
of
his
power
for
the
support
of
his
measure
,
he
will
become
equally
detest
and
despise
;
and
the
influence
of
the
common
will
insensibly
encroach
upon
the
pretension
of
the
crown
.
<EOS>
but
if
in
the
time
of
a
minority
,
the
power
of
the
government
should
be
divide
among
different
competitor
for
the
regency
,
the
parliament
and
people
will
find
it
still
more
easy
to
acquire
and
ascertain
the
liberty
at
which
they
aspire
,
because
they
will
have
the
balance
of
power
in
their
hand
,
and
be
able
to
make
either
scale
preponderate
.
<EOS>
I
could
say
a
great
deal
more
upon
this
subject
;
and
I
have
some
remark
to
make
relate
to
the
method
which
may
be
take
in
the
case
of
a
fresh
rupture
with
France
,
for
make
a
vigorous
impression
on
that
kingdom
.
<EOS>
but
these
I
in
list
defer
till
another
occasion
,
have
neither
room
nor
leisure
at
present
to
add
any
thing
,
but
that
I

<EOS>
DEAR
DOCTOR
,
 
as
I
have
now
pass
a
second
winter
at
Nice
<EOS>
I
think
myself
qualify
to
make
some
further
remark
on
this
climate
.
<EOS>
during
the
heat
of
last
summer
,
I
flatter
myself
with
the
prospect
of
the
fine
weather
I
should
enjoy
in
the
winter
;
but
neither
I
,
nor
any
person
in
this
country
,
could
foresee
the
rainy
weather
that
prevail
from
the
middle
of
November
,
till
the
twentieth
of
March
.
<EOS>
in
this
short
period
of
four
month
,
we
have
have
fifty
-
six
day
of
rain
,
which
I
take
to
be
a
great
quantity
than
generally
fall
during
the
six
bad
month
of
the
year
in
the
county
of
Middlesex
,
especially
as
it
be
,
for
the
most
part
,
a
heavy
,
continued
rain
.
<EOS>
the
south
wind
generally
predominate
in
the
wet
season
at
Nice
:
but
this
winter
the
rain
be
accompany
with
every
wind
that
blow
,
except
the
south
;
though
the
most
frequent
be
those
that
come
from
the
east
and
north
quarter
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
these
great
rain
,
such
as
be
never
know
before
at
Nice
in
the
memory
of
man
,
the
intermediate
day
of
fair
weather
be
delightful
,
and
the
ground
seem
perfectly
dry
.
<EOS>
the
air
itself
be
perfectly
free
from
moisture
.
<EOS>
though
I
live
upon
a
ground
floor
,
surround
on
three
side
by
a
garden
,
I
could
not
perceive
the
least
damp
,
either
on
the
floor
,
or
the
furniture
;
neither
be
I
much
incommode
by
the
asthma
,
which
use
always
to
harass
me
most
in
wet
weather
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
I
pass
the
winter
here
much
more
comfortably
than
I
expect
.
<EOS>
about
the
vernal
equinox
,
however
,
I
catch
a
violent
cold
,
which
be
attend
with
a
difficulty
of
breathing
,
and
as
the
sun
advance
towards
the
tropic
,
I
find
myself
still
more
subject
to
rheum
.
<EOS>
as
the
heat
increase
,
the
humour
of
the
body
be
rarefy
,
and
,
of
consequence
,
the
pore
of
the
skin
be
open
;
while
the
east
wind
sweep
over
the
Alps
and
Apennines
,
cover
with
snow
,
continue
surprisingly
sharp
and
penetrate
.
<EOS>
even
the
people
of
the
country
,
who
enjoy
good
health
,
be
afraid
of
expose
themselves
to
the
air
at
this
season
,
the
intemperature
of
which
may
last
till
the
middle
of
May
,
when
all
the
snow
on
the
mountain
will
probably
be
melt
:
then
the
air
will
become
mild
and
balmy
,
till
,
in
the
progress
of
summer
,
it
grow
disagreeably
hot
,
and
the
strong
evaporation
from
the
sea
make
it
so
saline
,
as
to
be
unhealthy
for
those
who
have
a
scorbutical
habit
.
<EOS>
when
the
sea
-
breeze
be
high
,
this
evaporation
be
so
great
as
to
cover
the
surface
of
the
body
with
a
kind
of
volatile
brine
,
as
I
plainly
perceive
last
summer
.
<EOS>
I
be
more
and
more
convinced
that
this
climate
be
unfavourable
for
the
scurvy
.
<EOS>
be
I
oblige
to
pass
my
life
in
it
,
I
would
endeavour
to
find
a
country
retreat
among
the
mountain
,
at
some
distance
from
the
sea
,
where
I
may
enjoy
a
cool
air
,
free
from
this
impregnation
,
unmoleste
by
those
fly
,
gnat
,
and
other
vermin
which
render
the
low
part
almost
uninhabitable
.
<EOS>
to
this
place
I
would
retire
in
the
month
of
June
,
and
there
continue
till
the
beginning
of
October
,
when
I
would
return
to
my
habitation
in
Nice
,
where
the
winter
be
remarkably
mild
and
agreeable
.
<EOS>
in
March
and
April
however
,
I
would
not
advise
a
valetudinarian
to
go
forth
,
without
take
precaution
against
the
cold
.
<EOS>
an
agreeable
summer
retreat
may
be
find
on
the
other
side
of
the
Var
,
at
,
or
near
the
town
of
Grasse
,
which
be
pleasantly
situate
on
the
ascent
of
a
hill
in
Provence
,
about
seven
english
mile
from
Nice
.
<EOS>
this
place
be
famous
for
its
pomatum
,
glove
,
wash
-
ball
,
perfume
,
and
toilette
-
box
,
line
with
bergamot
.
<EOS>
I
be
tell
it
afford
good
lodging
,
and
be
well
supply
with
provision
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
now
prepare
for
our
journey
to
England
,
from
the
exercise
of
which
I
promise
myself
much
benefit
:
a
journey
extremely
agreeable
,
not
only
on
that
account
,
but
also
because
it
will
restore
me
to
the
company
of
my
friend
,
and
remove
me
from
a
place
where
I
leave
nothing
but
the
air
which
I
can
possibly
regret
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
friendship
I
have
contract
at
Nice
be
with
stranger
,
who
,
like
myself
,
only
sojourn
here
for
a
season
.
<EOS>
I
now
find
by
experience
,
it
be
great
folly
to
buy
furniture
,
unless
one
be
resolve
to
settle
here
for
some
year
.
<EOS>
the
Nissards
assure
me
,
with
great
confidence
,
that
I
should
always
be
able
to
sell
it
for
a
very
little
loss
;
whereas
I
find
myself
oblige
to
part
with
it
for
about
one
-
third
of
what
it
cost
.
<EOS>
I
have
send
for
a
coach
to
Aix
,
and
as
soon
as
it
arrive
,
shall
take
my
departure
;
so
that
the
next
letter
you
receive
from
me
will
be
date
at
some
place
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
I
purpose
to
take
Antibes
,
Toulon
,
Marseilles
,
Aix
,
Avignon
,
and
Orange
,
in
my
way
:
place
which
I
have
not
yet
see
;
and
where
,
perhaps
,
I
shall
find
something
for
your
amusement
,
which
will
always
be
a
consideration
of
some
weight
with
,
 
Dear

TURIN
,
March
18
,
1765
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
Turin
be
about
thirty
league
from
Nice
,
the
great
part
of
the
way
lie
over
frightful
mountain
cover
with
snow
.
<EOS>
the
difficulty
of
the
road
,
however
,
reach
no
farther
than
Coni
,
from
whence
there
be
an
open
highway
through
a
fine
plain
country
,
as
far
as
the
capital
of
Piedmont
,
and
the
traveller
be
accommodate
with
chaise
and
horse
to
proceed
either
post
,
or
by
cambiatura
,
as
in
other
part
of
Italy
.
<EOS>
there
be
only
two
way
of
perform
the
journey
over
the
mountain
from
Nice
;
one
be
to
ride
a
mule
-
back
,
and
the
other
to
be
carry
in
a
chair
.
<EOS>
the
former
I
choose
,
and
set
out
with
my
servant
on
the
seventh
day
of
February
at
two
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
I
be
hardly
clear
of
Nice
,
when
it
begin
to
rain
so
hard
that
in
less
than
an
hour
the
mud
be
half
a
foot
deep
in
many
part
of
the
road
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
only
inconvenience
we
suffer
,
the
way
be
in
other
respect
practicable
enough
;
for
there
be
but
one
small
hill
to
cross
on
this
side
of
the
village
of
L'Escarene
,
where
we
arrive
about
six
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
the
ground
in
this
neighbourhood
be
tolerably
cultivate
,
and
the
mountain
be
plant
to
the
top
with
olive
tree
.
<EOS>
the
accommodation
here
be
so
very
bad
,
that
I
have
no
inclination
to
be
a
-
bed
longer
than
be
absolutely
necessary
for
refreshment
;
and
therefore
I
proceed
on
my
journey
at
two
in
the
morning
,
conduct
by
a
guide
,
whom
I
hire
for
this
purpose
at
the
rate
of
three
livre
a
day
.
<EOS>
have
ascend
one
side
,
and
descend
the
other
,
of
the
mountain
call
Braus
,
which
take
up
four
hour
,
though
the
road
be
not
bad
,
we
at
six
reach
the
village
of
Sospello
,
which
be
agreeably
situate
in
a
small
valley
,
surround
by
prodigious
high
and
barren
mountain
.
<EOS>
this
little
plain
be
pretty
fertile
,
and
be
water
by
a
pleasant
stream
,
form
a
delightful
contrast
with
the
hideous
rock
that
surround
it
.
<EOS>
have
repose
myself
and
my
mule
two
hour
at
this
place
,
we
continue
our
journey
over
the
second
mountain
,
call
Brovis
,
which
be
rather
more
considerable
than
the
first
,
and
in
four
hour
arrive
at
La
Giandola
,
a
tolerable
inn
situate
betwixt
<EOS>
the
high
road
and
a
small
river
,
about
a
gunshot
from
the
town
of
Brieglie
,
which
we
leave
on
the
right
.
<EOS>
as
we
jog
along
in
the
grey
of
the
morning
,
I
be
a
little
startled
at
two
figure
which
I
see
before
me
,
and
begin
to
put
my
pistol
in
order
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
observe
that
these
mountain
be
infest
with
contrabandier
,
a
set
of
smuggling
peasant
,
very
bold
and
desperate
,
who
make
a
traffic
of
sell
tobacco
,
salt
,
and
other
merchandize
,
which
have
not
pay
duty
,
and
sometimes
lay
traveller
under
contribution
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
doubt
but
there
be
a
gang
of
these
free
-
booter
at
hand
;
but
as
no
more
than
two
person
appear
,
I
resolve
to
let
them
know
we
be
prepared
for
defence
,
and
fire
one
of
my
pistol
,
in
hope
that
the
report
of
it
,
echo
from
the
surround
rock
,
would
produce
a
proper
effect
:
<EOS>
but
,
the
mountain
and
road
be
entirely
cover
with
snow
to
a
considerable
depth
,
there
be
little
or
no
reverberation
,
and
the
sound
be
not
loud
than
that
of
a
pop
-
gun
,
although
the
piece
contain
a
good
charge
of
powder
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
it
do
not
fail
to
engage
the
attention
of
the
stranger
,
one
of
whom
immediately
wheel
to
the
left
about
,
and
be
by
this
time
very
near
me
,
give
me
an
opportunity
of
contemplate
his
whole
person
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
tall
,
meagre
,
and
yellow
,
with
a
long
hook
nose
,
and
small
twinkle
eye
.
<EOS>
His
head
be
ease
in
a
woollen
night
-
cap
,
over
which
he
wear
a
flapped
hat
;
he
have
a
silk
handkerchief
about
his
neck
,
and
his
mouth
be
furnish
with
a
short
wooden
pipe
,
from
which
he
discharge
wreathe
cloud
of
tobacco
-
smoke
.
<EOS>
He
be
wrap
in
a
kind
of
capot
of
green
bay
,
line
with
wolf
-
skin
,
have
a
pair
of
monstrous
boot
,
quilt
on
the
inside
with
cotton
,
be
almost
cover
with
dirt
,
and
ride
a
mule
so
low
that
his
long
leg
hang
dangle
within
six
inch
of
the
ground
.
<EOS>
this
grotesque
figure
be
so
much
more
ludicrous
than
terrible
,
that
I
could
not
help
laugh
;
when
,
take
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
,
he
very
politely
accost
me
by
name
.
<EOS>
You
may
easily
guess
I
be
exceedingly
surprised
at
such
an
address
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
Brovis
:
but
he
forthwith
put
an
end
to
it
too
,
by
discover
himself
to
be
the
marquis
<EOS>
M
 
,
whom
I
have
the
honour
to
be
acquaint
with
at
Nice
.
<EOS>
after
have
rally
him
upon
his
equipage
,
he
give
me
to
understand
he
have
set
out
from
Nice
the
morning
of
the
same
day
that
I
depart
;
that
he
be
go
to
Turin
,
and
that
he
have
send
one
of
his
servant
before
him
to
Coni
with
his
baggage
.
<EOS>
know
him
to
be
an
agreeable
companion
,
I
be
glad
of
this
encounter
,
and
we
resolve
to
travel
the
rest
of
the
way
together
.
<EOS>
We
dine
at
La
Giandola
,
and
in
the
afternoon
ride
along
the
little
river
Roida
,
which
run
in
a
bottom
between
frightful
precipice
,
and
in
several
place
form
natural
cascade
,
the
noise
of
which
have
well
-
nigh
deprive
us
of
the
sense
of
hearing
;
after
a
winding
course
among
these
mountain
,
it
discharge
itself
into
the
Mediterranean
at
Vintimiglia
,
in
the
territory
of
Genoa
.
<EOS>
as
the
snow
do
not
lie
on
these
mountain
,
when
we
crack
our
whip
,
there
be
such
a
repercussion
of
the
sound
as
be
altogether
inconceivable
.
<EOS>
We
pass
by
the
village
of
Saorgio
,
situate
on
an
eminence
,
where
there
be
a
small
fortress
which
command
the
whole
pass
,
and
in
five
hour
arrive
at
our
inn
,
on
this
side
the
Col
de
Tende
,
where
we
take
up
our
quarter
,
but
have
very
little
reason
to
boast
of
our
entertainment
.
<EOS>
Our
great
difficulty
,
however
,
consist
in
pull
off
the
marquis
's
boot
,
which
be
of
the
kind
call
Seafarot
,
by
this
time
so
load
with
dirt
on
the
outside
,
and
so
swell
with
the
rain
within
,
that
he
could
neither
drag
them
after
him
as
he
walk
,
nor
disencumber
his
leg
of
them
,
without
such
violence
as
seem
almost
sufficient
to
tear
him
limb
from
limb
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
we
be
oblige
to
tie
a
rope
about
his
heel
,
and
all
the
people
in
the
house
assist
to
pull
,
the
poor
marquis
be
draw
from
one
end
of
the
apartment
to
the
other
before
the
boot
would
give
way
:
at
last
his
leg
be
happily
disengage
,
and
the
machine
carefully
dry
and
stuff
for
next
day
's
journey
.
  
<EOS>
We
take
our
departure
from
hence
at
three
in
the
morning
,
and
at
four
,
begin
to
mount
the
Col
de
Tende
,
which
be
by
far
the
high
mountain
in
the
whole
journey
:
it
be
now
quite
cover
with
snow
,
which
at
the
top
of
it
be
near
twenty
foot
thick
.
<EOS>
half
way
up
,
there
be
quarter
for
a
detachment
of
soldier
,
post
here
to
prevent
smuggling
,
and
an
inn
call
La
Ca
,
which
in
the
language
of
the
country
signify
the
house
.
<EOS>
at
this
place
,
we
hire
six
man
to
assist
us
in
ascend
the
mountain
,
each
of
them
provide
with
a
kind
of
hough
to
break
the
ice
,
and
make
a
sort
of
step
for
the
mule
.
<EOS>
when
we
be
near
the
top
,
however
,
we
be
oblige
to
alight
,
and
climb
the
mountain
support
each
by
two
of
those
man
,
call
coulant
who
walk
upon
the
snow
with
great
firmness
and
security
.
<EOS>
We
be
follow
by
the
mule
,
and
though
they
be
very
sure
-
footed
animal
,
and
be
frost
-
shod
for
the
occasion
,
they
stumble
and
fall
very
often
;
the
ice
be
so
hard
that
the
sharp
-
head
nail
in
their
shoe
could
not
penetrate
.
<EOS>
have
reach
the
top
of
this
mountain
,
from
whence
there
be
no
prospect
but
of
other
rock
and
mountain
,
we
prepare
for
descend
on
the
other
side
by
the
Leze
,
which
be
an
occasional
sledge
make
of
two
piece
of
wood
,
carry
up
by
the
coulant
for
this
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
much
relish
this
kind
of
carriage
,
especially
as
the
mountain
be
very
steep
,
and
cover
with
such
a
thick
fog
that
we
could
hardly
see
two
or
three
yard
before
us
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
our
guide
be
so
confident
,
and
my
companion
,
who
have
pass
the
same
way
on
other
occasion
,
be
so
secure
,
that
I
venture
to
place
myself
on
this
machine
,
one
of
the
coulant
stand
behind
me
,
and
the
other
sit
before
,
as
the
conductor
,
with
his
foot
paddle
among
the
snow
,
in
order
to
moderate
the
velocity
of
its
descent
.
<EOS>
thus
accommodate
,
we
descend
the
mountain
with
such
rapidity
,
that
in
an
hour
we
reach
Limon
,
which
be
the
native
place
of
almost
all
the
muleteer
who
transport
merchandize
from
Nice
to
Coni
and
Turin
.
<EOS>
here
we
wait
full
two
hour
for
the
mule
,
which
travel
with
the
servant
by
the
common
road
.
<EOS>
to
each
of
the
coulant
we
pay
forty
sol
,
which
be
nearly
equal
to
two
shilling
sterling
.
<EOS>
leave
Limon
,
we
be
in
two
hour
quite
disengaged
from
the
gorge
of
the
mountain
,
which
be
partly
cover
with
wood
and
pasturage
,
though
altogether
inaccessible
,
except
in
summer
;
but
from
the
foot
of
the
Col
de
Tende
,
the
road
lie
through
a
plain
all
the
way
to
Turin
.
<EOS>
We
take
six
hour
to
travel
from
the
inn
where
we
have
lodge
over
the
mountain
to
Limon
,
and
five
hour
from
thence
to
Coni
.
<EOS>
here
we
find
our
baggage
,
which
we
have
send
off
by
the
carrier
one
day
before
we
depart
from
Nice
;
and
here
we
dismiss
our
guide
,
together
with
the
mule
.
<EOS>
in
winter
,
you
have
a
mule
for
this
whole
journey
at
the
rate
of
twenty
livre
;
and
the
guide
be
pay
at
the
rate
of
two
livre
a
day
,
reckon
six
day
,
three
for
the
journey
to
Coni
,
and
three
for
their
return
to
Nice
.
<EOS>
We
set
out
so
early
in
the
morning
in
order
to
avoid
the
inconveniencie
and
danger
that
attend
the
passage
of
this
mountain
.
<EOS>
the
first
of
these
arise
from
your
meeting
with
long
string
of
loaded
mule
in
a
slippery
road
,
the
breadth
of
which
do
not
exceed
a
foot
and
an
half
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
altogether
impossible
for
two
mule
to
pass
each
other
in
such
a
narrow
path
,
the
muleteer
have
make
doubling
or
elbow
in
different
part
,
and
when
the
troop
of
mule
meet
,
the
least
numerous
be
oblige
to
turn
off
into
one
of
these
doubling
,
and
there
halt
until
the
other
be
past
.
<EOS>
traveller
,
in
order
to
avoid
this
disagreeable
delay
,
which
be
the
more
vexatious
,
consider
the
excessive
cold
,
begin
the
ascent
of
the
mountain
early
in
the
morning
before
the
mule
quit
their
inn
.
<EOS>
but
the
great
danger
of
travel
here
when
the
sun
be
up
,
proceed
from
what
they
call
the
valanche
.
<EOS>
these
be
ball
of
snow
detach
from
the
mountain
which
over
-
top
the
road
,
either
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
,
or
the
humidity
of
the
weather
.
<EOS>
a
piece
of
snow
thus
loosen
from
the
rock
,
though
perhaps
not
above
three
or
four
foot
in
diameter
,
increase
sometimes
in
its
descent
to
such
a
degree
,
as
to
become
two
hundred
pace
in
length
,
and
roll
down
with
such
rapidity
,
that
the
traveller
be
crush
to
death
before
he
can
make
three
step
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
these
dreadful
heap
drag
every
thing
along
with
them
in
their
descent
.
<EOS>
They
tear
up
huge
tree
by
the
root
,
and
if
they
chance
to
fall
upon
a
house
,
demolish
it
to
the
foundation
.
<EOS>
accident
of
this
nature
seldom
happen
in
the
winter
while
the
weather
be
dry
;
and
yet
scarce
a
year
pass
in
which
some
mule
and
their
driver
do
not
perish
by
the
valanche
.
<EOS>
at
Coni
we
find
the
countess
c
  
from
Nice
,
who
have
make
the
same
journey
in
a
chair
,
carry
by
porter
.
<EOS>
this
be
no
other
than
a
common
elbow
-
chair
of
wood
,
with
a
	
straw
bottom
,
cover
above
with
waxed
cloth
,
to
protect
the
traveller
from
the
rain
or
snow
,
and
provide
with
a
foot
-
board
upon
which
the
foot
rest
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
carry
like
a
sedan
-
chair
;
and
for
this
purpose
six
or
eight
porter
be
employ
at
the
rate
of
three
or
four
livre
a
head
per
day
,
accord
to
the
season
,
allow
three
day
for
their
return
.
<EOS>
of
these
six
man
,
two
be
between
the
pole
carry
like
common
chairman
,
and
each
of
these
be
support
by
the
other
two
,
one
at
each
hand
:
<EOS>
but
as
those
in
the
middle
sustain
the
great
burthen
,
they
be
relieve
by
the
other
in
a
regular
rotation
.
<EOS>
in
descend
the
mountain
,
they
carry
the
pole
on
their
shoulder
,
and
in
that
case
,
four
man
be
employ
,
one
at
each
end
.
  
<EOS>
at
Coni
,
you
may
have
a
chaise
to
go
with
the
same
horse
to
Turin
,
for
which
you
pay
fifteen
livre
,
and
be
a
day
and
a
half
on
the
way
.
<EOS>
You
may
post
it
,
however
,
in
one
day
,
and
then
the
price
be
seven
livre
ten
sol
per
post
,
and
ten
sol
to
the
postilion
.
<EOS>
the
method
we
take
be
that
of
cambiatura
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
chaise
with
horse
shift
at
the
same
stage
that
be
use
in
post
:
but
as
it
be
suppose
to
move
slower
,
we
pay
but
five
livre
per
post
,
and
ten
sol
to
the
postilion

<EOS>
in
order
to
quicken
its
pace
,
we
give
ten
sol
extraordinary
to
each
postilion
,
and
for
this
gratification
,
he
drive
us
even
faster
than
the
post
.
<EOS>
the
chaise
be
like
those
of
Italy
,
and
will
take
on
near
two
hundred
weight
of
baggage
.
  
<EOS>
Coni
be
situate
between
two
small
stream
,
and
though
neither
very
large

populous
,
be
considerable
for
the
strength
of
its
fortification
.
<EOS>
It
be
honour
with

Fortress

but
he
be

raise
the

,
after
have
give
battle
to
the

of
Sardinia
.
<EOS>
the
place
be
gallantly
defend
by
the
baron
Leutrum
,
a
german
protestant
,
the
good
general
in
the
sardinian
service
:
but
what
contribute
most
to
the
miscarriage
of
the
enemy
,
be
a
long
tract
of
heavy
rain
,
which
destroy
all
their
work

and
render
their

impracticable

<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
you
that
Piedmont
be
one
of
the
most
fertile

country
in
Europe

and
this
the
most

Piedmont

though
it
now
appear
to
disadvantage
from
the

season
of

I
shall

observe

through

arrive
in

<EOS>
We

DEAR
SIR
,
 
I
be
thus
far
on
my
way
to
England
.
<EOS>
I
have
resolve
to
leave
Nice
,
without
have
the
least
dispute
with
any
one
native
of
the
place
;
but
I
find
it
impossible
to
keep
this
resolution
.
<EOS>
My
landlord
,
Mr
C
 
,
a
man
of
fashion
,
with
whose
family
we
have
always
live
in
friendship
,
be
so
reasonable
as
to
expect
I
should
give
him
up
the
house
and
garden
,
though
they
be
to
be
pay
for
till
Michaelmas
,
and
peremptorily
declare
I
should
not
be
permit
to
sub
-
let
them
to
any
other
person
.
<EOS>
He
have
of
his
own
accord
assure
me
more
than
once
that
he
would
take
my
furniture
off
my
hand
,
and
trust
to
this
assurance
<EOS>
,
I
have
lose
the
opportunity
,
of
dispose
it
to
advantage
:
<EOS>
but
,
when
the
time
of
my
departure
draw
near
,
he
refuse
to
take
it
,
at
the
same
time
insist
upon
have
the
key
of
the
house
and
garden
,
as
well
as
on
be
pay
the
whole
rent
directly
,
though
it
would
not
be
due
till
the
middle
of
September
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
exasperate
at
this
treatment
from
a
man
whom
I
have
cultivate
with
particular
respect
,
that
I
determine
to
contest
it
at
law
:
<EOS>
but
the
affair
be
accommodate
by
the
mediation
of
a
father
of
the
Minims
,
a
friend
to
both
,
and
a
merchant
of
Nice
,
who
charge
himself
with
the
care
of
the
house
and
furniture
.
<EOS>
a
stranger
must
conduct
himself
with
the
utmost
circumspection
to
be
able
to
live
among
these
people
without
be
the
dupe
of
imposition
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
send
to
Aix
for
a
coach
and
four
horse
,
which
I
hire
at
the
rate
of
eighteen
French
livre
a
day
,
be
equal
to
fifteen
shilling
and
nine
-
pence
sterling
.
<EOS>
the
river
var
be
so
swell
by
the
melting
of
the
snow
on
the
mountain
,
as
to
be
impassable
by
any
wheel
-
carriage
;
and
,
therefore
,
the
coach
remain
at
Antibes
,
to
which
we
go
by
water
,
the
distance
be
about
nine
or
ten
mile
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
Antipolis
of
the
antient
,
say
to
have
be
build
like
Nice
,
by
a
colony
from
Marseilles
.
<EOS>
in
all
probability
,
however
,
it
be
later
than
the
foundation
of
Nice
,
and
take
its
name
from
its
be
situate
directly
opposite
to
that
city
.
<EOS>
pliny
say
it
be
famous
for
its
tunny
-
fishery
;
and
to
this
circumstance
Martial
allude
in
the
follow

I

<EOS>
the
famous
pickle
Garum
be
make
from
the
Thynnus
or
Tunny
as
well
as
from
the
Scomber
,
but
that
from
the
Scomber
be
count
the
most
delicate
.
<EOS>
commentator
,
however
,
be
not
agree
about
the
Scomber
or
Scombrus
.
<EOS>
some
suppose
it
be
the
Herring
or
Sprat
;
other
believe
it
be
the
mackarel
;
after
all
,
perhaps
it
be
the
Anchovy
,
which
I
do
not
find
distinguish
by
any
other
Latin
name
:
for
the
Encrasicolus
be
a
greek
appellation
altogether
generical
.
<EOS>
those
who
would
be
further
inform
about
the
Garum
and
the
Scomber

consult

<EOS>
at
present
,
Antibes
be
the
frontier
of
France
towards
Italy
,
pretty
strongly
fortify
,
and
garrison
by
a
battalion
of
soldier
.
<EOS>
the
town
be
small
and
inconsiderable
:
but
the
basin
of
the
harbour
be
surround
to
seaward
by
a
curious
bulwark
found
upon
pile
drive
in
the
water
,
consist
of
a
wall
,
rampart
,
casemate
,
and
quay

<EOS>
vessel
lie
very
safe
in
this
harbour
;
but
there
be
not
water
at
the
entrance
of
it
to
admit
of
ship
of
any
burthen
.
<EOS>
the
shallow
run
so
far
off
from
the
coast
,
that
a
ship
of
force
can
not
lie
near
enough
to
batter
the
town
;
but
it
be
bombard
in
the
late
war
.
<EOS>
Its
chief
strength
by
land
consist
in
a
small
quadrangular
fort
detach
from
the
body
of
the
place
,
which
,
in
a
particular
manner
,
command
the
entrance
of
the
harbour
.
<EOS>
the
wall
of
the
town
build
in
the
sea
have
embrasure
and
salient
angle
,
on
which
a
great
number
of
cannon
may
be
mount
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
the
adjacent
country
be
much
more
pleasant
than
that
on
the
side
of
Nice
;
and
there
be
certainly
no
essential
difference
in
the
climate
.
<EOS>
the
ground
here
be
not
so
encumbered
;
it
be
lay
out
in
agreeable
inclosure
,
with
interval
of
open
field
,
and
the
mountain
rise
with
an
easy
ascent
at
a
much
great
distance
from
the
sea
,
than
on
the
other
side
of
the
bay
.
<EOS>
besides
,
here
be
charming
ride
along
the
beach
,
which
be
smooth
and
firm
.
<EOS>
when
we
pass
in
the
last
week
of
April
,
the
corn
be
in
the
ear
;
the
cherry
be
almost
ripe
;
and
the
fig
have
begin
to
blacken
.
<EOS>
I
have
embark
my
heavy
baggage
on
board
a
London
ship
,
which
happen
to
be
at
Nice
,
ready
to
sail
:
as
for
our
small
trunk
or
portmanteaus
,
which
we
carry
along
with
us
,
they
be
examine
at
Antibes
;
but
the
ceremony
be
perform
very
superficially
,
in
consequence
of
tip
the
searcher
with
half
-
a

crown
,
which
be
a
wonderful
conciliator
at
all
the
bureaus
in
this
country
.
  
<EOS>
We
lie
at
Cannes
,
a
neat
village
,
charmingly
situate
on
the
beach
of
the
Mediterranean
,
exactly
opposite
to
the
isle
Marguerites
,
where
state

prisoner
be
confine
.
<EOS>
as
there
be
some
good
house
in
this
place
,
I
would
rather
live
here
for
the
sake
of
the
mild
climate
,
than
either
at
Antibes
or
Nice
.
<EOS>
here
you
be
not
coope
up
within

nor
crowd
with
soldier
and

but
be
already

burn

consume

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
They
stand

<EOS>
I
could
hardly
refrain

shed
tear
at
this
dismal
spectacle
,
when
I
recall
the
idea
of
what
it
be
about
eighteen
month
ago
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
stay
all
night
at
Frejus
,
I
have
an
opportunity
of
view
the
amphitheatre
at
leisure
.
<EOS>
as
near
as
I
can
judge
by
the
eye
,
it
be
of
the
same
dimension
with
that
of
Nismes
;
but
shockingly
dilapidated
.
<EOS>
the
stone
seat
rise
from
the
arena
be
still
extant
,
and
the
cell
under
them
,
where
the
wild
beast
be
keep
.
<EOS>
there
be
likewise
the
remain
of
two
gallery
one
over
another
;
and
two
vomitoria
or
great
gateway
at
opposite
side
of
the
arena
,
which
be
now
a
fine
green
,
with
a
road
through
the
middle
of
it
:
but
all
the
external
architecture
and
the
ornament
be
demolish
.
<EOS>
the
most
intire
part
of
the
wall
now
constitute
part
of
a
monastery
,
the
monk
of
which
,
I
be
tell
,
have
help
to
destroy
the
amphitheatre
,
by
remove
the
stone
for
their
own
purpose
of
building
.
<EOS>
in
the
neighbourhood
of
this
amphitheatre
,
which
stand
without
the
wall
,
be
the
vestige
of
an
old
edifice
,
say
to
have
be
the
palace
where
the
imperator
or
president
reside
:
for
it
be
a
roman
colony
,
much
favour
by
Julius
Caesar
,
who
give
it
the
name
of
Forum
Julii
,
and
Civitas
Forojuliensis
.
<EOS>
in
all
probability
,
it
be
he
who
build
the
amphitheatre
,
and
bring
hither
the
water
ten
league
from
the
river
of
Ciagne
,
by
mean
of
an
aqueduct
,
some
arcade
of
which
be
still
stand
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
a
great
number
of
statue
be
find
in
this
place
,
together
with
antient
inscription
,
which
have
be
publish
by
different
author
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
you
that
Julius
Agricola
,
the
father
-
in
-
law
of
Tacitus
,
the
historian
,
be
a
native
of
Frejus
,
which
be
now
a
very
poor
inconsiderable
place
.
<EOS>
from
hence
the
country
open
to
the
left
,
form
an
extensive
plain
between
the
sea
and
the
mountain
,
which
be
a
continuation
of
the
Alps
,
that
stretch
through
Provence
and
Dauphine
.
<EOS>
this
plain
water
with
pleasant
stream
,
and
vary
with
vineyard
,
corn
-
field
,
and
meadow
-
ground
,
afford
a
most
agreeable
prospect
to
our
eye
,
which
be
accustom
to
the
sight
of
scorch
sand
,
rugged
rock
,
and
abrupt
mountain
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
although
this
have
much
the
appearance
of
a
corn
-
country
,
I
be
tell
it
do
not
produce
enough
for
the
consumption
of
its
inhabitant
,
who
be
oblige
to
have
annual
supply
from
abroad
,
import
at
Marseilles
.
<EOS>
a
Frenchman
,
at
an
average
,
eat
three
time
the
quantity
of
bread
that
satisfy
a
native
of
England
,
and
indeed
it
be
undoubtedly
the
staff
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
I
be
therefore
surprised
that
the
Provencaux
do
not
convert
part
of
their
vineyard
into
corn
-
field
:
for
they
may
boast
of
their
wine
as
they
please
;
but
that
which
be
drink
by
the
common
people
,
not
only
here
,
but
also
in
all
the
wine
country
of
France
,
be
neither
so
strong
,
nourish
,
nor
(
in
my
opinion
)
<EOS>
so
pleasant
to
the
taste
as
the
small
-
beer
of
England
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
own
that
all
the
peasant
who
have
wine
for
their
ordinary
drink
be
of
a
diminutive
size
,
in
comparison
of
those
who
use
milk
,
beer
,
or
even
water
;
and
it
be
a
constant
observation
,
that
when
there
be
a
scarcity
of
wine
,
the
common
people
be
always
more
healthy
,
than
in
those
season
when
it
abound
.
<EOS>
the
longer
I
live
,
the
more
I
be
convince
that
wine
,
and
all
ferment
liquor
,
be
pernicious
to
the
human
constitution
;
and
that
for
the
preservation
of
health
,
and
exhilaration
of
the
spirit
,
there
be
no
beverage
comparable
to
simple
water
.
<EOS>
between
Luc
and
Toulon
,
the
country
be
delightfully
parcel
out
into
inclosure
.
<EOS>
here
be
plenty
of
rich
pasturage
for
black
cattle
,
and
a
great
number
of
pure
stream
and
rivulet
than
I
have
observe
in
any
other
part
of
France
.
  
<EOS>
Toulon
be
a
considerable
place
,
even
exclusive
of
the
basin
,
dock
,
and
arsenal
,
which
indeed
be
such
as
justify
the
remark
make
by
a
stranger
when
he
view
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
king
of
France
(
say
he
)
be
great
at
Toulon
than
at
Versailles
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
quay
,
the
jetty
,
the
dock
,
and
magazine
,
be
contrive
and
execute
with
precision
,
order
,
solidity
,
and
magnificence
.
<EOS>
I
count
fourteen
ship
of
the
line
lie
unrig
in
the
basin
,
besides
the
tonant
of
eighty
gun
,
which
be
in
dock
repairing
,
and
a
new
frigate
on
the
stock
.
<EOS>
I
be
credibly
inform
that
in
the
last
war
,
the
king
of
France
be
so
ill
-
serve
with
cannon
for
his
navy
,
that
in
every
action
there
be
scarce
a
ship
which
have
not
several
piece
burst
.
<EOS>
these
accident
do
great
damage
,
and
discourage
the
french
mariner
to
such
a
degree
,
that
they
become
more
afraid
of
their
own
gun
than
of
those
of
the
English
.
<EOS>
there
be
now
at
Toulon
above
two
thousand
piece
of
iron
cannon
unfit
for
service
.
<EOS>
this
be
an
undeniable
proof
of
the
weakness
and
neglect
of
the
french
administration
:
but
a
more
suprize
proof
of
their
imbecility
,
be
the
state
of
the
fortification
that
defend
the
entrance
of
this
very
harbour
.
<EOS>
I
have
some
reason
to
think
that
they
trust
for
its
security
entirely
to
our
opinion
that
it
must
be
inaccessible
.
<EOS>
Capt
E
 
,
of
one
of
our
frigate
,
lately
enter
the
harbour
with
a
contrary
wind
,
which
by
oblige
him
to
tack
,
afford
an
opportunity
of
sound
the
whole
breadth
and
length
of
the
passage
.
<EOS>
He
come
in
without
a
pilot
,
and
make
a
pretence
of
buying
cordage
,
or
some
other
store
;
but
the
french
officer
be
much
chagrin
at
the
boldness
of
his
enterprize
.
<EOS>
They
allege
that
he
come
for
no
other
reason
but
to
sound
the
channel
;
and
that
he
have
an
engineer
aboard
,
who
make
drawing
of
the
land
and
the
fort
,
their
bearing
and
distance
.
<EOS>
in
all
probability
,
these
suspicion
be
communicate
to
the
ministry
;
for
an
order
immediately
arrive
,
that
no
stranger
should
be
admit
into
the
dock
and
arsenal
.
  
<EOS>
part
of
the
road
from
hence
to
Marseilles
lie
through
a
vast
mountain
,
which
resemble
that
of
Estrelles
;
but
be
not
so
well
covered
with
wood
,
though
it
have
the
advantage
of
an
agreeable
stream
run
through
the
bottom
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
much
pleased
with
Marseilles
,
which
be
indeed
a
noble
city
,
large
,
populous
,
and
flourish
.
<EOS>
the
street
of
what
be
call
the
new
Town
be
open
,
airy
and
spacious
;
the
house
well
build
,
and
even
magnificent
.
<EOS>
the
harbour
be
an
oval
basin
,
surround
on
every
side
either
by
the
building
or
the
land
,
so
that
the
shipping
lie
perfectly
secure
;
and
here
be
generally
an
incredible
number
of
vessel
.
<EOS>
on
the
city
side
,
there
be
a
semi
-
circular
quay
of
free
-
stone
,
which
extend
thirteen
hundred
pace
;
and
the
space
between
this
and
the
house
that
front
it
,
be
continually
fill
with
a
surprising
crowd
of
people
.
<EOS>
the
gallie
,
to
the
number
of
eight
or
nine
,
be
moor
with
their
stern
to
one
part
of
the
wharf
,
and
the
slave
be
permit
to
work
for
their
own
benefit
at
their
respective
occupation
,
in
little
shop
or
booth
,
which
they
rent
for
a
trifle
.
<EOS>
there
you
see
tradesman
of
all
kind
sit
at
work
,
chain
by
one
foot
,
shoe
-
maker
,
taylor
,
silversmith
,
watch

,
scrivener
,
bookseller
,
cutler
,
and
all
manner
of
shop
-
keeper
.
<EOS>
They
pay
about
two
sol
a
day
to
the
king
for
this
indulgence
;
live
well
and
look
jolly
;
and
can
afford
to
sell
their
good
and
labour
much
cheap
than
other
dealer
and
tradesman
.
<EOS>
at
night
,
however
,
they
be
oblige
to
lie
aboard
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
great
face
of
business
at
Marseilles
,
their
trade
be
greatly
on
the
decline
;
and
their
merchant
be
fail
every
day
.
<EOS>
this
decay
of
commerce
be
in
a
great
measure
owe
to
the
English
,
who
,
at
the
peace
,
pour
in
such
a
quantity
of
european
merchandize
into
Martinique
and
Guadalupe
,
that
when
the
merchant
of
Marseilles
send
over
their
cargo
,
they
find
the
market
overstock
,
and
be
oblige
to
sell
for
a
considerable
loss
.
<EOS>
besides
,
the
french
colonist
have
such
a
stock
of
sugar
,
coffee
,
and
other
commodity
lie
by
them
during
the
war
,
that
upon
the
first
notice
of
peace
,
they
ship
them
off
in
great
quantity
for
Marseilles
.
<EOS>
I
be
tell
that
the
produce
of
the
island
be
at
present
cheap
here
than
where
it
grow
;
and
on
the
other
hand
the
merchandize
of
this
country
sell
for
less
money
at
Martinique
than
in
Provence
.
  
<EOS>
a
single
person
,
who
travel
in
this
country
,
may
live
at
a
reasonable
rate
in
these
town
,
by
eat
at
the
public
ordinary
:
but
I
would
advise
all
family
that
come
hither
to
make
any
stay
,
to
take
furnished
lodging
as
soon
as
they
can
:
for
the
expence
of
living
at
an
hotel
be
enormous
.
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
pay
at
Marseilles
four
livre
a
head
for
every
meal
,
and
half
that
price
for
my
servant
,
and
be
charge
six
livre
a
day
besides
for
the
apartment
,
so
that
our
daily
expence
,
include
breakfast
and
a
valet
de
place
,
amount
to
two
loui'dore
.
<EOS>
the
same
imposition
prevail
all
over
the
south
of
France
,
though
it
be
generally
suppose
to
be
the
cheap
and
most
plentiful
part
of
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
without
all
doubt
,
it
must
be
owe
to
the
folly
and
extravagance
of
english
traveller
,
who
have
allow
themselves
to
be
fleece
without
wince
,
until
this
extortion
be
become
authorize
by
custom
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
disagreeable
riding
in
the
avenue
of
Marseilles
,
because
you
be
confine
in
a
dusty
high
road
,
croude
with
carriage
and
beast
of
burden
,
between
two
white
wall
,
the
reflection
from
which
,
while
the
sun
shine
,
be
intolerable
.
<EOS>
but
in
this
neighbourhood
there
be
a
vast
number
of
pleasant
country
-
house
,
call
Bastides
,
say
to
amount
to
twelve
thousand
,
some
of
which
may
be
rent
ready
furnish
at
a
very
reasonable
price
.
<EOS>
Marseilles
be
a
gay
city
,
and
the
inhabitant
indulge
themselves
in
a
variety
of
amusement
.
<EOS>
They
have
assembly
,
a
concert
spirituel
,
and
a
comedy
.
<EOS>
here
be
also
a
spacious
cour
,
or
walk
shade
with
tree
,
to
which
in
the
evening
there
be
a
great
resort
of
well
-
dress
people
.
  
<EOS>
marseille
be
a
free
port
,
there
be
a
bureau
about
half
a
league
from
the
city
on
the
road
to
Aix
,
where
all
carriage
undergo
examination
;
and
if
any
thing
contraband
be
find
,
the
vehicle
,
baggage
,
and
even
the
horse
be
confiscate
.
<EOS>
We
escape
this
disagreeable
ceremony
by
the
sagacity
of
our
driver
.
<EOS>
of
his
own
accord
,
he
declare
at
the
bureau
,
that
we
have
buy
a
pound
of
coffee
and
some
sugar
at
Marseilles
,
and
be
ready
to
pay
the
duty
,
which
amount
to
about
ten
sol
.
<EOS>
They
take
the
money
,
give
him
a
receipt
,
and
let
the
carriage
pass
,
without
further
question
.
  
<EOS>
I
propose
to
stay
one
night
only
at
Aix
:
but
Mr
A

who
be
here

have
find
such
benefit
from
drink
the
water
,
that
I
be
persuade
to
make
trial
of
them
for
eight
or
ten
day
.
<EOS>
I
have
accordingly
take
private
lodging
,
and
drank
them
at
the
fountain
-
head
,
not
without
find
considerable
benefit
.
<EOS>
in
my
next
I
shall
say
something
further
of
these
water
,
though
I
be
afraid
they
will
not
prove
a
source
of
much
entertainment
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
sufficient
for
me
to
find
them
contribute
in
any

Mr

<EOS>
as
I

I
could
not

in
justice
to
myself

try
the
united
effort
of

especially
as
this
consideration

inforce
by
the
kind

Aix

large

<EOS>
It

roman
colony

above
a

It

a
considerable
number

<EOS>
the
parliament

which
be
hold
at
Aix

bring
hither
a
great
resort
of
people
;
and
as
many

person
of

they

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
some
of
our
english
people
complain
,
that
when
they
be
present
to
him
,
they
meet
with
a
very
cold
reception

<EOS>
the
French
,
as
well
as
other
foreigner
,
have
no
idea
of
a
man
of
family
and
fashion
,
without
the
title
of
duke
,
count
,
marquis

or
lord
,
and
where
an
english
gentleman
be
introduce
by
the
simple
expression
of
monsieur
tel
<EOS>
,
Mr
Suchathing
,
they
think
he
be
some
plebeian

unworthy

<EOS>
Aix
be
situate
in
a
bottom
,
almost
surround
by
hill
,
which
,
however
,
do
not
screen
it
from
the
Bize
,
or
north
wind
,
that
blow
extremely
sharp
in
the
winter
and
spring
,
render
the
air
almost
insupportably
cold
,
and
very
dangerous
to
those
who
have
some
kind
of
pulmonary
complaint
,
such
as
tubercule
,
abscess
,
or
spitting
of
blood
.
<EOS>
Lord
H
 
,
who
pass
part
of
last
winter
in
this
place
,
afflict
with
some
of
these
symptom
,
grow
bad
every
day
while
he
continue
at
Aix
:
<EOS>
but
,
he
no
sooner
remove
to
Marseilles
,
than
all
his
complaint
abate
;
such
a
difference
there
be
in
the
air
of
these
two
place
,
though
the
distance
between
them
do
not
exceed
ten
or
twelve
mile
.
<EOS>
but
the
air
of
Marseilles
,
though
much
more
mild
than
that
of
Aix
in
the
winter
be
not
near
so
warm
as
the
climate
of
Nice
,
where
we
find
in
plenty
such
flower
,
fruit
,
and
vegetable
,
even
in
the
severe
season
,
as
will
not
grow
and
ripen
,
either
at
Marseilles
or
Toulon
.
  
<EOS>
if
the
air
of
Aix
be
disagreeably
cold
in
the
winter
,
it
be
render
quite
insufferable
in
the
summer
,
from
excessive
heat
,
occasion
by
the
reflexion
from
the
rock
and
mountain
,
which
at
the
same
time
obstruct
the
circulation
of
air
:
<EOS>
for
it
must
be
observe
,
that
the
same
mountain
which
serve
as
funnel
and
canal
,
to
collect
and
discharge
the
keen
blast
of
winter
,
will
provide
screen
to
intercept
intirely
the
faint
breeze
of
summer
.
<EOS>
Aix
,
though
pretty
well
provide
with
butcher
's
meat
,
be
very
ill
supply
with
potherb
;
and
they
have
no
poultry
but
what
come
at
a
vast
distance
from
the
Lionnois
.
<EOS>
They
say
their
want
of
root
,
cabbage
,
cauliflower
,
etc
.
<EOS>
be
owe
to
a
scarcity
of
water
:
<EOS>
but
the
truth
be
,
they
be
very
bad
gardener
.
<EOS>
Their
oil
be
good
and
cheap
:
their
wine
be
indifferent
:
but
their
chief
care
seem
employ
on
the
culture
of
silk
,
the
staple
of
Provence
,
which
be
every
where
shade
with
plantation
of
mulberry
tree
,
for
the
nourishment
of
the
worm
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
boasted
cheapness
of
every
article
of
housekeeping
,
in
the
south
of
France
,
I
be
persuade
a
family
may
live
for
less
money
at
York
,
Durham
,
Hereford
,
and
in
many
other
city
of
England
than
at
Aix
in
Provence
;
keep
a
more
plentiful
table
;
and
be
much
more
comfortably
situate
in
all
respect
.
<EOS>
I
find
lodging
and
provision
at
Aix
fifty
per
cent
dearer
than
at
Montpellier
,
which
be
count
the
dear
place
in
Languedoc
.
  
<EOS>
the
bath
of
Aix
,
so
famous
in
antiquity
,
be
quite
demolish
by
the
irruption
of
the
barbarian
.
<EOS>
the
very
source
of
the
water
be
lose
,
till
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
(
I
think
the
year
1704
)
,
when
it
be
discover
by
accident
,
in
dig
for
the
foundation
of
a
house
,
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
,
just
without
the
city
wall
.
<EOS>
near
the
same
place
be
find
a
small
stone
altar
,
with
the
figure
of
a
Priapus
,
and
some
letter
in
capital
,
which
the
antiquarians
have
differently
interpret
.
<EOS>
from
this
figure
,
it
be
suppose
that
the
water
be
efficacious
in
case
of
barrenness
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
time
,
however
,
before
any
person
would
venture
to
use
them
internally
,
as
it
do
not
appear
that
they
have
ever
be
drink
by
the
antient
.
<EOS>
on
their
re
-
appearance
,
they
be
chiefly
use
for
bath
to
horse
,
and
other
beast
which
have
the
mange
,
and
other
cutaneous
eruption
.
<EOS>
at
length
poor
people
begin
to
bathe
in
them
for
the
same
disorder
,
and
receive
such
benefit
from
them
,
as
attract
the
attention
of
more
curious
inquirer
.
<EOS>
a
very
superficial
and
imperfect
analysis
be
make
and
publish
,
with
a
few
remarkable
history
of
the
cure
they
have
perform
,
by
three
different
physician
of
those
day
;
and
those
little
treatise
,
I
suppose
,
encourage
valetudinarian
to
drink
them
without
ceremony
.
<EOS>
They
be
find
serviceable
in
the
gout
,
the
gravel
,
scurvy
,
dropsy
,
palsy
,
indigestion
,
asthma
,
and
consumption
;
and
their
fame
soon
extend
itself
all
over
Languedoc
,
Gascony
,
Dauphine
,
and
Provence
.
<EOS>
the
magistrate
,
with
a
view
to
render
them
more
useful
and
commodious
,
have
raise
a
plain
building
,
in
which
there
be
a
couple
of
private
bath
,
with
a
bedchamber
adjoin
to
each
,
where
individual
may
use
them
both
internally
and
externally
,
for
a
moderate
expence
.
<EOS>
these
bath
be
pave
with
marble
,
and
supply
with
water
each
by
a
large
brass
cock
,
which
you
can
turn
at
pleasure
.
<EOS>
at
one
end
of
this
edifice
,
there
be
an
octagon
,
open
at
top
,
have
a
bason
,
with
a
stone
pillar
in
the
middle
,
which
discharge
water
from
the
same
source
,
all
round
,
by
eight
small
brass
cock
;
and
hither
people
of
all
rank
come
of
a
morning
,
with
their
glass
,
to
drink
the
water
,
or
wash
their
sore
,
or
subject
their
contract
limb
to
the
stream
.
<EOS>
this
last
operation
,
call
the
douche
,
however
,
be
more
effectually
undergo
in
the
private
bath
,
where
the
stream
be
much
more
powerful
.
<EOS>
the
natural
warmth
of
this
water
,
as
nearly
as
I
can
judge
from
recollection
,
be
about
the
same
degree
of
temperature
with
that
in
the
Queen
's
Bath
,
at
Bath
in
Somersetshire
.
<EOS>
It
be
perfectly
transparent
,
sparkle
in
the
glass
,
light
and
agreeable
to
the
taste
,
and
may
be
drink
without
any
preparation
,
to
the
quantity
of
three
or
four
pint
at
a
time
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
people
at
Aix
who
swallow
fourteen
half
pint
glass
every
morning
,
during
the
season
,
which
be
in
the
month
of
May
,
though
it
may
be
take
with
equal
benefit
all
the
year
round
.
<EOS>
It
have
no
sensible
operation
but
by
urine
,
an
effect
which
pure
water
would
produce
,
if
drink
in
the
same
quantity
.
  
<EOS>
if
we
may
believe
those
who
have
publish
their
experiment
,
this
water
produce
neither
agitation
,
cloud
,
or
change
of
colour
,
when
mix
with
acid
,
alkali
,
tincture
of
gall
,
syrup
of
violet
,
or
solution
of
silver
.
<EOS>
the
residue
,
after
boiling
,
evaporation
,
and
filtration
,
afford
a
very
small
proportion
of
purge
salt
,
and
calcarious
earth
,
which
last
ferment
with
strong
acid
.
<EOS>
as
I
have
neither
hydrometer
nor
thermometer
to
ascertain
the
weight
and
warmth
of
this
water
;
nor
time
to
procure
the
proper
utensil
,
to
make
the
preparation
,
and
repeat
the
experiment
necessary
to
exhibit
a
complete
analysis
,
I
do
not
pretend
to
enter
upon
this
process
;
but
content
myself
with
drinking
,
bathing
,
and
use
the
douche
,
which
perfectly
answer
my
expectation
,
have
,
in
eight
day
,
almost
cure
an
ugly
scorbutic
tetter
,
which
have
for
some
time
deprive
me
of
the
use
of
my
right
hand
.
<EOS>
I
observe
that
the
water
,
when
use
externally
,
leave
always
a
kind
of
oily
appearance
on
the
skin
:
that
when
,
we
boil
it
at
home
,
in
an
earthen
pot
,
the
steam
smell
like
those
of
sulphur
,
and
even
affect
my
lung
in
the
same
manner
:
but
the
bath
itself
smell
strong
of
a
lime
-
kiln
.
<EOS>
the
water
,
after
stand
all
night
in
a
bottle
,
yield
a
remarkably
vinous
taste
and
odour
,
something
analogous
to
that
of
dulcify
spirit
of
nitre
.
<EOS>
whether
the
active
particle
consist
of
a
volatile
vitriol
,
or
a
very
fine
petroleum
,
or
a
mixture
of
both
,
I
shall
not
pretend
to
determine
:
but
the
good
way
I
know
of
discover
whether
it
be
really
impregnate
with
a
vitriolic
principle
,
too
subtil
and
fugitive
for
the
usual
operation
of
chymistry
,
be
to
place
bottle
,
fill
with
wine
,
in
the
bath
,
or
adjacent
room
,
which
wine
,
if
there
be
really
a
volatile
acid
,
in
any
considerable
quantity
,
will
be
prick
in
eight
and
forty
hour
.
  
<EOS>
have
order
our
coach
to
be
refit
,
and
provide
with
fresh
horse
,
as
well
as
with
another
postilion
,
in
consequence
of
which
improvement
,
I
pay
at
the
rate
of
a
loui'dore
per
diem
to
lyon
and
back
again
,
we
depart
from
Aix
,
and
<EOS>
the
second
day
of
our
journey
pass
the
Durance
in
a
boat
,
lie
at
Avignon
.
<EOS>
this
river
,
the
Druentia
of
the
antient
,
be
a
considerable
stream
,
extremely
rapid
,
which
descend
from
the
mountain
,
and
discharge
itself
in
the
Rhone
.
<EOS>
after
violent
rain
it
extend
its
channel
,
so
as
to
be
impassable
,
and
often
overflow
the
country
to
a
great
extent
.
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
a
plain
,
betwixt
Orgon
and
this
river
,
we
meet
the
coach
in
which
we
have
travel
eighteen
month
before
,
from
lyon
to
Montpellier
,
conduct
by
our
old
driver
Joseph
,
who
no
sooner
recognize
my
servant
at
a
distance
,
by
his
musquetoon
,
than
he
come
run
towards
our
carriage
,
and
seize
my
hand
,
even
shed
tear
of
joy
.
<EOS>
Joseph
have
be
travel
through
Spain
,
and
be
so
imbrowne
by
the
sun
,
that
he
may
have
pass
for
an
Iroquois
.
<EOS>
I
be
much
pleased
with
the
mark
of
gratitude
which
the
poor
fellow
express
towards
his
benefactor
.
<EOS>
He
have
some
private
conversation
with
our
voiturier
,
whose
name
be
Claude
,
to
whom
he
give
such
a
favourable
character
of
us
,
as
in
all
probability
induce
him
to
be
wonderfully
obliging
during
the
whole
journey
.
  
<EOS>
You
know
Avignon
be
a
large
city
belong
to
the
pope
.
<EOS>
It

Burgundians

<EOS>
It

eighty
thousand

since
that

<EOS>
not

1662

the
county
Venaiss

the
ancient
domain
of
Provence

and
therefore
reunite
it
to
the
crown
of
France
,
which
accordingly
take
possession
;
though
it
be
afterwards
restore
to
the
Roman
see

the
peace
of
Pisa

<EOS>
the
pope
,
however
,
hold
it
by
a
precarious
title
,
at
the
mercy
of
the
french
king
,
who
may
one
day
be
induce
to
resume
it
,
upon
payment
of
the
original
purchase

money
.
<EOS>
as
a
succession
of
pope
reside
here
for
the
space
of
seventy
year
,
the
city
could
not
fail
to
be
adorn
with
a
great
number
of
magnificent
church

convent
,
which
be
richly
embellish
with
painting

sculpture

relique

<EOS>
among
the
last

be
that

the
celebrated
Laura

whom
Petrarch
have
immortalize
by
his
poetry
,
and
for
whom
Francis

of
France
take
the
trouble
to
write
an
epitaph

<EOS>
Avignon
be
govern
by
a
vice

legate
from
the

<EOS>
It

a
large
place

situate
in
a
fruitful

surround
by
high
wall
build
of
hewn
stone

which
on

west
side

<EOS>
here
be
a
noble
bridge
over
the
river

but
it
be
now
in
ruin
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
side
,
a
branch
of
the
Sorgue
run
through
part
of
the
city

<EOS>
this
be
the
river
anciently
call
Sulga
,
form
by
the
famous
fountain
of
Vaucluse
in
this
neighbourhood
,
where
the
poet
Petrarch
reside
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
charming
transparent
stream
,
abound
with
excellent
trout
and
craw

fish
.
<EOS>
We
pass
over
it
on
a
stone
bridge
,
in
our
way
to
Orange
,
the
Arausio
Cavarum
of
the
Romans

still
distinguish
by
some
noble
monument
of
antiquity

<EOS>
these
consist
of
a
circus

an

a

a
triumphal
arch

which
last
be
erect
in

Luctatius
Catulus

after
the
great
victory
they
obtain
in
this

<EOS>
It

a
very
magnificent
edifice

adorn
on

trophy

battle

<EOS>
the
ornament
of
the
architecture

be
wonderfully
elegant
for
the

in
which
it
be
erect

and
the
whole
be
surprisingly
well
preserve
,
consider
its
great

<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
to
be
as
entire
and
perfect
as
the
arch

Septimius
Severus
at
Rome

<EOS>
next
day
we
pass
two
very
impetuous

the
Drome

the
Isere

<EOS>
the
first

cross
in
a
boat
,
which
as
well
as
that
upon
the
Durance
,
be
manage
by
the
traille
,
a
moveable
or
run
pulley
,
on
a
rope
stretch
between
two
wooden
machine
erect
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
the
contrivance
be
simple
and
effectual
,
and
the
passage
equally
safe
and
expeditious
.
<EOS>
the
boatman
have
nothing
to
do
,
but
by
mean
of
a
long
massy
rudder
,
to
keep
the
head
obliquely
to
the
stream
,
the
force
of
which
push
the
boat
along
,
the
block
to
which
it
be
fix
slide
upon
the
rope
from
one
side
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
all
these
river
take
their
rise
from
the
mountain
,
which
be
continue
through
Provence
and
Dauphine
,
and
fall
into
the
Rhone
:
and
all
of
them
,
when
swell
by
sudden
rain
,
overflow
the
flat
country
.
<EOS>
although
Dauphine
afford
little
or
no
oil
,
it
produce
excellent
wine
,
particularly
those
of
Hermitage
and
Cote
-
roti
.
<EOS>
the
first
of
these
be
sell
on
the
spot
for
three
livre
the
bottle
,
and
the
other
for
two
.
<EOS>
the
country
likewise
yield
a
considerable
quantity
of
corn
,
and
a
good
deal
of
grass
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
water
with
stream
,
and
agreeably
shade
with
wood
.
<EOS>
the
weather
be
pleasant
,
and
we
have
a
continued
song
of
nightingale
from
Aix
to
Fontainebleau
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
pretend
to
specify
the
antiquity
of
Vienne
,
antiently
call
Vienna
Allobrogum
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
roman
colony
,
and
a
considerable
city
,
which
the
antient
spare
no
pain
and
expence
to
embellish
.
<EOS>
It
be
still
a
large
town
,
stand
among
several
hill
on
the
bank
of
the
Rhone
,
though
all
its
former
splendor
be
eclipse
,
its
commerce
decay
,
and
most
of
its
antiquity
be
bury
in
ruin
.
<EOS>
the
church
of
Notre
Dame
<EOS>
de
la
Vie
be
undoubtedly
a
temple
.
<EOS>
on
the
left
of
the
road
,
as
you
enter
it
,
by
the
gate
of
Avignon
,
there
be
a
handsome
obelisk
,
or
rather
pyramid
,
about
thirty
foot
high
,
raise
upon
a
vault
support
by
four
pillar
of
the
tuscan
order
.
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
a
roman
work
,
and
Montfaucon
suppose
it
to
be
a
tomb
,
as
he
perceive
an
oblong
stone
jet
out
from
the
middle
of
the
vault
,
in
which
the
ashe
of
the
defunct
be
probably
contain
.
<EOS>
the
story
of
Pontius
Pilate
,
who
be
say
to
have
end
his
day
in
this
place
,
be
a
fable
.
<EOS>
on
the
seventh
day
of
our
journey
from
Aix
,
we
arrive
at
Lyons
,
where
I
shall
take

<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
I
be
at
last
in
a
situation
to
indulge
my
view
with
a
sight
of
Britain
,
after
an
absence
of
two
year
;
and
indeed
you
can
not
imagine
what
pleasure
I
feel
while
I
survey
the
white
cliff
of
Dover
,
at
this
distance
.
<EOS>
not
that
I
be
at
all
affect
by
the
nescia
qua
dulcedine
natalis
soli
,
of
Horace
.
<EOS>
that
seem
to
be
a
kind
of
fanaticism
found
on
the
prejudice
of
education
,
which
induce
a
laplander
to
place
the
terrestrial
paradise
among
the
snow
of
Norway
,
and
a
Swiss
to
prefer
the
barren
mountain
of
solleure
to
the
fruitful
plain
of
Lombardy
.
<EOS>
I
be
attach
to
my
country
,
because
it
be
the
land
of
liberty
,
cleanliness
,
and
convenience
:
<EOS>
but
I
love
it
still
more
tenderly
,
as
the
scene
of
all
my
interesting
connexion
;
as
the
habitation
of
my
friend
,
for
whose
conversation
,
correspondence
,
and
esteem
,
I
wish
alone
to
live
.
  
<EOS>
Our
journey
hither
from
lyon
produce
neither
accident
nor
adventure
worth
notice
;
but
abundance
of
little
vexation
,
which
may
be
term
the
Plagues
of
post
.
<EOS>
at
Lyons
,
where
we
stay
only
a
few
day
,
I
find
a
return
-
coach
,
which
I
hire
to
Paris
for
six
loui'dore
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
fine
roomy
carriage
,
elegantly
furnish
,
and
make
for
travel
;
so
strong
and
solid
in
all
its
part
,
that
there
be
no
danger
of
its
be
shake
to
piece
by
the
roughness
of
the
road
:
but
its
weight
and
solidity
occasion
so
much
friction
between
the
wheel
and
the
axle
-
tree
,
that
we
run
the
risque
of
be
set
on
fire
three
or
four
time
a
day
.
<EOS>
upon
a
just
comparison
of
all
circumstance
post
be
much
more
easy
,
convenient
,
and
reasonable
in
England
than
in
France
.
<EOS>
the
english
carriage
,
horse
,
harness
,
and
road
be
much
well
;
and
the
postilion
more
obliging
and
alert
.
<EOS>
the
reason
be
plain
and
obvious
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
ill
-
use
at
the
post
-
house
in
England
,
I
can
be
accommodate
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
the
publican
on
the
road
be
sensible
of
this
,
and
therefore
they
vie
with
each
other
in
give
satisfaction
to
traveller
.
<EOS>
but
in
France
,
where
the
post
be
monopolize
,
the
post
-
master
and
postilion
,
know
that
the
traveller
depend
intirely
upon
them
,
be
the
more
negligent
and
remiss
in
their
duty
,
as
well
as
the
more
encouraged
to
insolence
and
imposition
.
<EOS>
indeed
the
stranger
seem
to
be
leave
intirely
at
the
mercy
of
those
fellow
,
except
in
large
town
,
where
he
may
have
recourse
to
the
magistrate
or
command
officer
.
<EOS>
the
post
stand
very
often
by
itself
in
a
lone
country
situation
,
or
in
a
paultry
village
,
where
the
post
-
master
be
the
principal
inhabitant
;
and
in
such
a
case
,
if
you
should
be
ill
-
treat
,
by
be
supply
with
bad
horse
;
if
you
should
be
delay
on
frivolous
pretence
,
in
order
to
extort
money
;
if
the
postilion
should
drive
at
a
waggon
pace
,
with
a
view
to
provoke
your
impatience
;
or
should
you
in
any
shape
be
insult
by
them
or
their
master
;
and
I
know
not
any
redress
you
can
have
,
except
by
a
formal
complaint
to
the
comptroller
of
the
post
,
who
be
generally
one
of
the
minister
of
state
,
and
pay
little
or
no
regard
to
any
such
representation
.
<EOS>
I
know
an
english
gentleman
,
the
brother
of
an
earl
,
who
write
a
letter
of
complaint
to
the
Duc
de
Villars
,
governor
of
Provence
,
against
the
post
-
master
of
Antibes
,
who
have
insult
and
impose
upon
him
.
<EOS>
the
duke
answer
his
letter
,
promise
to
take
order
that
the
grievance
should
be
redress
;
and
never
think
of
it
after
.
<EOS>
another
great
inconvenience
which
attend
post
in
France
,
be
that
if
you
be
retard
by
any
accident
,
you
can
not
in
many
part
of
the
kingdom
find
a
lodging
,
without
perhaps
travel
two
or
three
post
farther
than
you
would
choose
to
go
,
to
the
prejudice
of
your
health
,
and
even
the
hazard
of
your
life
;
whereas
on
any
part
of
the
post
-
road
in
England
,
you
will
meet
with
tolerable
accommodation
at
every
stage
.
<EOS>
through
the
whole
south
of
France
,
except
in
large
city
,
the
inn
be
cold
,
damp
,
dark
,
dismal
,
and
dirty
;
the
landlord
equally
disobliging
and
rapacious
;
the
servant
aukward
,
sluttish
,
and
slothful
;
and
the
postilion
lazy
,
lounge
,
greedy
,
and
impertinent
.
<EOS>
if
you
chide
them
for
linger
,
they
will
continue
to
delay
you
the
longer
:
if
you
chastise
them
with
sword
,
cane
,
cudgel
,
or
horse
-
whip
,
they
will
either
disappear
entirely
,
and
leave
you
without
resource
;
or
they
will
find
mean
to
take
vengeance
by
overturn
your
carriage
.
<EOS>
the
good
method
I
know
of
travel
with
any
degree
of
comfort
,
be
to
allow
yourself
to
become
the
dupe
of
imposition
,
and
stimulate
their
endeavour
by
extraordinary
gratification
.
<EOS>
I
lay
down
a
resolution
(
and
keep
it
)
to
give
no
more
than
four
and
twenty
sol
per
post
between
the
two
postilion
;
but
I
be
now
persuade
that
for
three
-
pence
a
post
more
,
I
should
have
be
much
better
serve
,
and
should
have
perform
the
journey
with
much
great
pleasure
.
<EOS>
We
meet
with
no
adventure
upon
the
road
worth
recite
.
<EOS>
the
first
day
we
be
retard
about
two
hour
by
the
dutchess
D
 
lle
,
and
her
son
the
duc
de
R
 
f
 
t
,
who
by
virtue
of
an
order
from
the
minister
,
have
anticipate
all
the
horse
at
the
post
.
<EOS>
They
accost
my
servant
,
and
ask
if
his
master
be
a
lord
?
<EOS>
He
think
proper
to
answer
in
the
affirmative
,
upon
which
the
duke
declare
that
he
must
certainly
be
of
french
extraction
,
inasmuch
as
he
observe
the
lily
of
France
in
his
arm
on
the
coach
.
<EOS>
this
young
nobleman
speak
a
little
English
.
<EOS>
He
ask
whence
we
have
come
;
and
understanding
we
have
be
in
Italy
,
desire
to
know
whether
the
man
like
France
or
Italy
best
?
<EOS>
upon
his
give
France
the
preference
,
he
clap
him
on
the
shoulder
,
and
say
he
be
a
lad
of
good
taste
.
<EOS>
the
dutchess
ask
if
her
son
speak
English
well
,
and
seem
mightily
pleased
when
my
man
assure
her
he
do
.
<EOS>
They
be
much
more
free
and
condescend
with
my
servant
than
with
myself
;
for
,
though
we
salute
them
in
passing
,
and
be
even
suppose
to
be
person
of
quality
,
they
do
not
open
their
lip
,
while
we
stand
close
by
them
at
the
inn
-
door
,
till
their
horse
be
change
.
<EOS>
They
be
go
to
Geneva
;
and
their
equipage
consist
of
three
coach
and
six
,
with
five
domestic
a
-
horseback
.
<EOS>
the
dutchess
be
a
tall
,
thin
,
raw
-
boned
woman
,
with
her
head
close
shave
.
<EOS>
this
delay
oblige
us
to
lie
two
post
short
of
Macon
,
at
a
solitary
auberge
call
Maison
Blanche
,
which
have
nothing
white
about
it
,
but
the
name
.
<EOS>
the
Lionnois
be
one
of
the
most
agreeable
and
best
-
cultivate
country
I
ever
behold
,
diversify
with
hill
,
dale
,
wood
,
and
water
,
lay
out
in
extensive
corn
-
field
and
rich
meadow
,
well
stock
with
black
cattle
,
and
adorn
with
a
surprising
number
of
town
,
village
,
villas
,
and
convent
,
generally
situate
on
the
brow
of
gently
swell
hill
,
so
that
they
appear
to
the
great
advantage
.
<EOS>
what
contribute
in
a
great
measure
to
the
beauty
of
this
,
and
the
Maconnois
,
be
the
charming
pastoral
Soame
,
which
from
the
city
of
chalon
wind
its
silent
course
so
smooth
and
gentle
,
that
one
can
scarce
discern
which
way
its
current
flow
.
<EOS>
It
be
this
placid
appearance
that
tempt
so
many
people
to
bathe
in
it
at
Lions
,
where
a
good
number
of
individual
be
drown
every
summer
:
whereas
there
be
no
instance
of
any
person
thus
perish
in
the
Rhone
,
the
rapidity
of
it
deter
every
body
from
bathe
in
its
stream
.
<EOS>
next
night
we
pass
at
Beaune
where
we
find
nothing
good
but
the
wine
,
for
which
we
pay
forty
sol
the
bottle
.
<EOS>
at
chalon
our
axle
-
tree
take
fire
;
an
accident
which
detain
us
so
long
,
that
it
be
ten
before
we
arrive
at
Auxerre
,
where
we
lay
.
<EOS>
in
all
probability
we
must
have
lodge
in
the
coach
,
have
not
we
be
content
to
take
four
horse
,
and
pay
for
six
,
two
post
successively
.
<EOS>
the
alternative
be
,
either
to
proceed
with
four
on
those
term
,
or
stay
till
the
other
horse
should
come
in
and
be
refresh
.
<EOS>
in
such
an
emergency
,
I
would
advise
the
traveller
to
put
up
with
the
four
,
and
he
will
find
the
postilion
so
much
upon
their
mettle
,
that
those
stage
will
be
perform
sooner
than
the
other
in
which
you
have
the
full
complement
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
an
english
gentleman
lay
up
at
Auxerre
with
a
broken
arm
,
to
whom
I
send
my
compliment
,
with
offer
of
service
;
but
his
servant
tell
my
man
that
he
do
not
choose
to
see
any
company
,
and
have
no
occasion
for
my
service
.
<EOS>
this
sort
of
reserve
seem
peculiar
to
the
english
disposition
.
<EOS>
when
two
native
of
any
other
country
chance
to
meet
abroad
,
they
run
into
each
other
's
embrace
like
old
friend
,
even
though
they
have
never
hear
of
one
another
till
that
moment
;
whereas
two
englishman
in
the
same
situation
maintain
a
mutual
reserve
and
diffidence
,
and
keep
without
the
sphere
of
each
other
's
attraction
,
like
two
body
endow
with
a
repulsive
power
.
<EOS>
We
only
stop
to
change
horse
at
Dijon
,
the
capital
of
Burgundy
,
which
be
a
venerable
old
city
;
but
we
pass
part
of
a
day
at
Sens
,
and
visit
a
manufacture
of
that
stuff
we
call
Manchester
velvet
,
which
be
here
make
and
dye
to
great
perfection
,
under
the
direction
of
english
workman
,
who
have
be
seduce
from
their
own
country
.
<EOS>
at
Fontainebleau
,
we
go
to
see
the
palace
,
or
as
it
be
call
,
the
castle
,
which
though
an
irregular
pile
of
building
,
afford
a
great
deal
of
lodging
,
and
contain
some
very
noble
apartment
,
particularly
the
hall
of
audience
,
with
the
king
's
and
queen
's
chamber
,
upon
which
the
ornament
of
carving
and
gilding
be
lavish
with
profusion
rather
than
propriety
.
<EOS>
here
be
some
rich
parterre
of
flower
-
garden
,
and
a
noble
orangerie
,
which
,
however
,
we
do
not
greatly
admire
,
after
have
live
among
the
natural
orange
grove
of
Italy
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
we
have
enjoy
fine
summer
weather
,
and
I
find
myself
so
well
,
that
I
imagine
my
health
be
intirely
restore
:
but
betwixt
Fontainebleau
and
Paris
<EOS>
,
we
be
overtake
by
a
black
storm
of
rain
,
sleet
,
and
hail
,
which
seem
to
reinstate
winter
in
all
its
rigour
;
for
the
cold
weather
continue
to
this
day
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
resist
this
attack
.
<EOS>
I
catch
cold
immediately
;
and
this
be
reinforce
at
Paris
,
where
I
stay
but
three
day
.
<EOS>
the
same
man

(

Guenegaud

who
own
the

that
bring

and
we
come
hither
by
easy
journey
.
<EOS>
the
first
night
we
lodge
at
Breteuil
,
where
we
find
an
elegant
inn
,
and
very
good
accommodation
.
<EOS>
but
the
next
we
be
force
to
take
up
our
quarter
,
at
the
house
where
we
have
formerly
pass
a
very
disagreeable
night
at
Abbeville
.
<EOS>
I
be
now
in
tolerable
lodging
,
where
I
shall
remain
a
few
week
,
merely
for
the
sake
of
a
little
repose
;
then
I
shall
gladly
tempt
that
invidious
straight
which
still
divide
you
from
 
Yours
,
