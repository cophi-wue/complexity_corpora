   
BRETTON
.
  
<EOS>
My
godmother
live
in
a
handsome
house
in
the
clean
and
ancient
town
of
Bretton
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
's
family
have
be
resident
there
for
generation
,
and
bore
,
indeed
,
the
name
of
their
birthplace
 
Bretton
of
Bretton
:
whether
by
coincidence
,
or
because
some
remote
ancestor
have
be
a
personage
of
sufficient
importance
to
leave
his
name
to
his
neighbourhood
,
I
know
not
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
be
a
girl
I
go
to
Bretton
about
twice
a
year
,
and
well
I
like
the
visit
.
<EOS>
the
house
and
its
inmate
specially
suit
me
.
<EOS>
the
large
peaceful
room
,
the
well
-
arrange
furniture
,
the
clear
wide
window
,
the
balcony
outside
,
look
down
on
a
fine
antique
street
,
where
Sundays
and
holiday
seem
always
to
abide
 
so
quiet
be
its
atmosphere
,
so
clean
its
pavement
 
<EOS>
these
thing
please
me
well
.
  
<EOS>
one
child
in
a
household
of
grown
people
be
usually
make
very
much
of
,
and
in
a
quiet
way
I
be
a
good
deal
take
notice
of
by
Mrs.
Bretton
,
who
have
be
leave
a
widow
,
with
one
son
,
before
I
know
her
;
her
husband
,
a
physician
,
have
die
while
she
be
yet
a
young
and
handsome
woman
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
not
young
,
as
I
remember
her
,
but
she
be
still
handsome
,
tall
,
well
-
make
,
and
though
dark
for
an
Englishwoman
,
yet
wear
always
the
clearness
of
health
in
her
brunette
cheek
,
and
its
vivacity
in
a
pair
of
fine
,
cheerful
black
eye
.
<EOS>
People
esteem
it
a
grievous
pity
that
she
have
not
confer
her
complexion
on
her
son
,
whose
eye
be
blue
 
though
,
even
in
boyhood
,
very
piercing
 
and
the
colour
of
his
long
hair
such
as
friend
do
not
venture
to
specify
,
except
as
the
sun
shine
on
it
,
when
they
call
it
golden
.
<EOS>
He
inherit
the
line
of
his
mother
's
feature
,
however
;
also
her
good
tooth
,
her
stature
(
or
the
promise
of
her
stature
,
for
he
be
not
yet
full
-
grown
)
,
and
,
<EOS>
what
be
well
,
her
health
without
flaw
,
and
her
spirit
of
that
tone
and
equality
which
be
well
than
a
fortune
to
the
possessor
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
autumn
of
the
year
 
I
be
stay
at
Bretton
;
my
godmother
have
come
in
person
to
claim
me
of
the
kinsfolk
with
whom
be
at
that
time
fix
my
permanent
residence
.
<EOS>
I
believe
she
then
plainly
see
event
come
,
whose
very
shadow
I
scarce
guessed
;
yet
of
which
the
faint
suspicion
suffice
to
impart
unsettled
sadness
,
and
make
me
glad
to
change
scene
and
society
.
  
<EOS>
Time
always
flow
smoothly
for
me
at
my
godmother
's
side
;
not
with
tumultuous
swiftness
,
but
blandly
,
like
the
gliding
of
a
full
river
through
a
plain
.
<EOS>
My
visit
to
her
resemble
the
sojourn
of
christian
and
hopeful
beside
a
certain
pleasant
stream
,
with
"
green
tree
on
each
bank
,
and
meadow
beautify
with
lily
all
the
year
round
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
charm
of
variety
there
be
not
,
nor
the
excitement
of
incident
;
but
I
like
peace
so
well
,
and
seek
stimulus
so
little
,
that
when
the
latter
come
I
almost
feel
it
a
disturbance
,
and
wish
rather
it
have
still
hold
aloof
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
a
letter
be
receive
of
which
the
content
evidently
cause
Mrs.
Bretton
surprise
and
some
concern
.
<EOS>
I
think
at
first
it
be
from
home
,
and
tremble
,
expect
I
know
not
<EOS>
what
disastrous
communication
:
to
me
,
however
,
no
reference
be
make
,
and
the
cloud
seem
to
pass
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
,
on
my
return
from
a
long
walk
,
I
find
,
as
I
enter
my
bedroom
,
an
unexpected
change
.
<EOS>
in
,
addition
to
my
own
french
bed
in
its
shady
recess
,
appear
in
a
corner
a
small
crib
,
drape
with
white
;
and
in
addition
to
my
mahogany
chest
of
drawer
,
I
see
a
tiny
rosewood
chest
.
<EOS>
I
stand
still
,
gaze
,
and
consider
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
what
be
these
thing
the
sign
and
token
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
<EOS>
the
answer
be
obvious
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
second
guest
be
come
:
Mrs.
Bretton
expect
other
visitor
.
"
  
<EOS>
on
descend
to
dinner
,
explanation
ensue
.
<EOS>
a
little
girl
,
I
be
tell
,
would
shortly
be
my
companion
:
the
daughter
of
a
friend
and
distant
relation
of
the
late
Dr.
Bretton
's
.
<EOS>
this
little
girl
,
it
be
add
,
have
recently
lose
her
mother
;
though
,
indeed
,
Mrs.
Bretton
ere
long
subjoin
,
the
loss
be
not
so
great
as
may
at
first
appear
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Home
(
home
it
seem
be
the
name
)
have
be
a
very
pretty
,
but
a
giddy
,
careless
woman
,
who
have
neglect
her
child
,
and
disappoint
and
dishearten
her
husband
.
<EOS>
so
far
from
congenial
have
the
union
prove
,
that
separation
at
last
ensue
 
separation
by
mutual
consent
,
not
after
any
legal
process
.
<EOS>
soon
after
this
event
,
the
lady
have
over
-
exert
herself
at
a
ball
,
catch
cold
,
take
a
fever
,
and
die
after
a
very
brief
illness
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
,
naturally
a
man
of
very
sensitive
feeling
,
and
shock
inexpressibly
by
too
sudden
communication
of
the
news
,
could
hardly
,
it
seem
,
now
be
persuade
but
that
some
over
-
severity
on
his
part
 
some
deficiency
in
patience
and
indulgence
 
have
contribute
to
hasten
her
end
.
<EOS>
He
have
brood
over
this
idea
till
his
spirit
be
seriously
affect
;
the
medical
man
insist
on
travel
be
try
as
a
remedy
,
and
meanwhile
Mrs.
Bretton
have
offer
to
take
charge
of
his
little
girl
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
hope
,
"
add
my
godmother
in
conclusion
,
"
the
child
will
not
be
like
her
mamma
;
as
silly
and
frivolous
a
little
flirt
as
ever
sensible
man
be
weak
enough
to
marry
.
<EOS>
for
,
"
say
she
,
"
Mr.
Home
_
be
_
a
sensible
man
in
his
way
,
though
not
very
practical
:
he
be
fond
of
science
,
and
live
half
his
life
in
a
laboratory
try
experiment
 
a
thing
his
butterfly
wife
could
neither
comprehend
nor
endure
;
and
indeed
"
confess
my
godmother
,
"
I
should
not
have
like
it
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
answer
to
a
question
of
mine
,
she
further
inform
me
that
her
late
husband
use
to
say
,
Mr.
Home
have
derive
this
scientific
turn
from
a
maternal
uncle
,
a
french
savant
;
for
he
come
,
it
seem
;
of
mixed
french
and
scottish
origin
,
and
have
connection
now
live
in
France
,
of
whom
more
than
one
write
_
de
_
before
his
name
,
and
call
himself
noble
.
  
<EOS>
that
same
evening
at
nine
o'clock
,
a
servant
be
despatch
to
meet
the
coach
by
which
our
little
visitor
be
expect
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
and
I
sit
alone
in
the
drawing
-
room
wait
her
come
;
John
Graham
Bretton
be
absent
on
a
visit
to
one
of
his
schoolfellow
who
live
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
My
godmother
read
the
evening
paper
while
she
wait
;
I
sew
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
wet
night
;
the
rain
lash
the
pane
,
and
the
wind
sound
angry
and
restless
.
  
<EOS>
"
poor
child
!
"
say
Mrs.
Bretton
from
time
to
time
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
weather
for
her
journey
!
<EOS>
I
wish
she
be
safe
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
little
before
ten
the
door
-
bell
announce
Warren
's
return
.
<EOS>
no
sooner
be
the
door
open
than
I
run
down
into
the
hall
;
there
lie
a
trunk
and
some
band
-
box
,
beside
them
stand
a
person
like
a
nurse
-
girl
,
and
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
be
Warren
with
a
shawled
bundle
in
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
that
the
child
?
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
miss
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
would
have
open
the
shawl
,
and
try
to
get
a
peep
at
the
face
,
but
it
be
hastily
turn
from
me
to
Warren
's
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
put
me
down
,
please
,
"
say
a
small
voice
when
Warren
open
the
drawing
-
room
door
,
"
and
take
off
this
shawl
,
"
continue
the
speaker
,
extract
with
its
minute
hand
the
pin
,
and
with
a
sort
of
fastidious
haste
doff
the
clumsy
wrapping
.
<EOS>
the
creature
which
now
appear
make
a
deft
attempt
to
fold
the
shawl
;
but
the
drapery
be
much
too
heavy
and
large
to
be
sustain
or
wield
by
those
hand
and
arm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
give
it
to
Harriet
,
please
,
"
be
then
the
direction
,
"
and
she
can
put
it
away
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
say
,
it
turn
and
fix
its
eye
on
Mrs.
Bretton
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
here
,
little
dear
,
"
say
that
lady
.
<EOS>
"
come
and
let
me
see
if
you
be
cold
and
damp
:
come
and
let
me
warm
you
at
the
fire
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
child
advance
promptly
.
<EOS>
relieve
of
her
wrapping
,
she
appear
exceedingly
tiny
;
but
be
a
neat
,
completely
-
fashioned
little
figure
,
light
,
slight
,
and
straight
.
<EOS>
seat
on
my
godmother
's
ample
lap
,
she
look
a
mere
doll
;
her
neck
,
delicate
as
wax
,
her
head
of
silky
curl
,
increase
,
I
think
,
the
resemblance
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
talk
in
little
fond
phrase
as
she
chafe
the
child
's
hand
,
arm
,
and
foot
;
first
she
be
consider
with
a
wistful
gaze
,
but
soon
a
smile
answer
her
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
be
not
generally
a
caressing
woman
:
even
with
her
deeply
-
cherish
son
,
her
manner
be
rarely
sentimental
,
often
the
reverse
;
but
when
the
small
stranger
smile
at
her
,
she
kiss
it
,
ask
,
"
what
be
my
little
one
's
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
missy
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
besides
Missy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
polly
,
papa
call
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
polly
be
content
to
live
with
me
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
_
always
_
;
but
till
papa
come
home
.
<EOS>
Papa
be
go
away
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
shake
her
head
expressively
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
return
to
Polly
,
or
send
for
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
he
,
madam
?
<EOS>
do
you
know
he
will
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
Harriet
think
not
:
at
least
not
for
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
He
be
ill
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
eye
fill
.
<EOS>
She
draw
her
hand
from
Mrs.
Bretton
's
and
make
a
movement
to
leave
her
lap
;
it
be
at
first
resist
,
but
she
say
 
"
please
,
I
wish
to
go
:
I
can
sit
on
a
stool
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
allow
to
slip
down
from
the
knee
,
and
take
a
footstool
,
she
carry
it
to
a
corner
where
the
shade
be
deep
,
and
there
seat
herself
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
,
though
a
commanding
,
and
in
grave
matter
even
a
peremptory
woman
,
be
often
passive
in
trifle
:
she
allow
the
child
her
way
.
<EOS>
She
say
to
me
,
"
take
no
notice
at
present
.
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
take
notice
:
I
watch
Polly
rest
her
small
elbow
on
her
small
knee
<EOS>
,
her
head
on
her
hand
;
I
observe
her
draw
a
square
inch
or
two
of
pocket
-
handkerchief
from
the
doll
-
pocket
of
her
doll
-
skirt
,
and
then
I
hear
her
weep
.
<EOS>
other
child
in
grief
or
pain
cry
aloud
,
without
shame
or
restraint
;
but
this
be
weep
:
the
tiny
occasional
sniff
testify
to
her
emotion
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
do
not
hear
it
:
which
be
quite
as
well
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
a
voice
,
issue
from
the
corner
,
demand
 
"
May
the
bell
be
ring
for
Harriet
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
ring
;
the
nurse
be
summon
and
come
.
  
<EOS>
"
Harriet
,
I
must
be
put
to
bed
,
"
say
her
little
mistress
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
ask
where
my
bed
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
signify
that
she
have
already
make
that
inquiry
.
  
<EOS>
"
ask
if
you
sleep
with
me
,
Harriet
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Missy
,
"
say
the
nurse
:
"
you
be
to
share
this
young
lady
's
room
,
"
designate
me
.
  
<EOS>
Missy
do
not
leave
her
seat
,
but
I
see
her
eye
seek
me
.
<EOS>
after
some
minute
'
silent
scrutiny
,
she
emerge
from
her
corner
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
,
madam
,
good
night
,
"
say
she
to
Mrs.
Bretton
;
but
she
pass
me
mute
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
-
night
,
Polly
,
"
I
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
need
to
say
good
-
night
,
since
we
sleep
in
the
same
chamber
,
"
be
the
reply
,
with
which
she
vanish
from
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
We
hear
Harriet
propose
to
carry
her
up
-
stair
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
need
,
"
be
again
her
answer
 
<EOS>
"
no
need
,
no
need
:
"
and
her
small
step
toil
wearily
up
the
staircase
.
  
<EOS>
on
go
to
bed
an
hour
afterwards
,
I
find
her
still
wide
awake
.
<EOS>
She
have
arrange
her
pillow
so
as
to
support
her
little
person
in
a
sit
posture
:
her
hand
,
place
one
within
the
other
,
rest
quietly
on
the
sheet
,
with
an
old
-
fashioned
calm
most
unchildlike
.
<EOS>
I
abstain
from
speak
to
her
for
some
time
,
but
just
before
extinguish
the
light
,
I
recommend
her
to
lie
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
by
and
by
,
"
be
the
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
will
take
cold
,
missy
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
take
some
tiny
article
of
raiment
from
the
chair
at
her
crib
side
,
and
with
it
cover
her
shoulder
.
<EOS>
I
suffer
her
to
do
as
she
please
.
<EOS>
listen
awhile
in
the
darkness
,
I
be
aware
that
she
still
weep
,
 
<EOS>
weep
under
restraint
,
quietly

cautiously

<EOS>
on
awake
with
daylight
,
a
trickling
of
water
catch
my
ear
.
<EOS>
behold
!
<EOS>
there
she
be
rise
and
mount
on
a
stool
near
the
washstand
,
with
pain
and
difficulty
incline
the
ewer
(
which
she
could
not
lift
)
so
as
to
pour
its
content
into
the
basin
.
<EOS>
It
be
curious
to
watch
her
as
she
wash
and
dress
,
so
small
,
busy
,
and
noiseless
.
<EOS>
evidently
she
be
little
accustomed
to
perform
her
own
toilet
;
and
the
button
,
string
,
hook
and
eye
,
offer
difficulty
which
she
encounter
with
a
perseverance
good
to
witness
.
<EOS>
She
fold
her
night
-
dress
,
she
smooth
the
drapery
of
her
couch
quite
neatly
;
withdraw
into
a
corner
,
where
the
sweep
of
the
white
curtain
conceal
her
,
she
become
still
.
<EOS>
I
half
rise
,
and
advance
my
,
head
to
see
how
she
be
occupy
.
<EOS>
on
her
knee
,
with
her
forehead
bent
on
her
hand
,
I
perceive
that
she
be

<EOS>
Her

She

up

up

She

then
follow
her

<EOS>
Harriet
temporarily
leave
that

day
,
to
go
to
her
own

who
live
in
the
neighbourhood

<EOS>
on
descend
,
I
find
Paulina

the
child
call
herself
Polly

her
full
name
be
Paulina
Mary
)
<EOS>
seat
at
the
breakfast

table

by
Mrs.

side
;
a
mug
of
milk
stand
before
her

<EOS>
a
morsel
of
bread
fill
her

which
lie
passive
on

she

not

<EOS>
"
how
we
shall
conciliate
this
little
creature

say
Mrs.

to
me

"
I

nothing

by

"
  
<EOS>
I
express
my
confidence
in
the
effect

time
and
kindness

<EOS>
"
if
she
be
to
take
a
fancy

she

soon
settle

not
till
then

reply
Mrs.
Bretton
.
    
<EOS>
PAULINA
.
  
<EOS>
some
day
elapse
,
and
it
appear
she
be
not
likely
to
take
much
of
a
fancy
to
anybody
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
exactly
naughty
or
wilful
:
she
be
far
from
disobedient
;
but
an
object
less
conducive
to
comfort
 
to
tranquillity
even
 
than
she
present
,
it
be
scarcely
possible
to
have
before
one
's
eye
.
<EOS>
She
mope
:
<EOS>
no
grow
person
could
have
perform
that
uncheering
business
better
;
no
furrowed
face
of
adult
exile
,
long
for
Europe
at
Europe
's
antipode
,
ever
bear
more
legibly
the
sign
of
home
sickness
than
do
her
infant
visage
.
<EOS>
She
seem
grow
old
and
unearthly
.
<EOS>
I
,
Lucy
Snowe
,
plead
guiltless
of
that
curse
,
an
overheated
and
discursive
imagination
;
but
whenever
,
open
a
room
-
door
,
I
find
her
seat
in
a
corner
alone
,
her
head
in
her
pigmy
hand
,
that
room
seem
to
me
not
inhabit
,
but
haunt
.
  
<EOS>
and
again
,
when
of
moonlight
night
,
on
wake
,
I
beheld
her
figure
,
white
and
conspicuous
in
its
night
-
dress
,
kneel
upright
in
bed
,
and
pray
like
some
Catholic
or
Methodist
enthusiast
 
some
precocious
fanatic
or
untimely
saint
 
<EOS>
I
scarcely
know
what
thought
I
have
;
but
they
run
risk
of
be
hardly
more
rational
and
healthy
than
that
child
's
mind
must
have
be
.
  
<EOS>
I
seldom
catch
a
word
of
her
prayer
,
for
they
be
whisper
low
:
<EOS>
sometimes
,
indeed
,
they
be
not
whisper
at
all
,
but
put
up
unuttered
;
such
rare
sentence
as
reach
my
ear
still
bear
the
burden
,
"
papa
;
my
dear
papa
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
,
I
perceive
,
be
a
one
-
idea'd
nature
;
betray
that
monomaniac
tendency
<EOS>
I
have
ever
think
the
most
unfortunate
with
which
man
or
woman
can
be
curse
.
  
<EOS>
what
may
have
be
the
end
of
this
fretting
,
have
it
continue
unchecked
,
can
only
be
conjecture
:
it
receive
,
however
,
a
sudden
turn
.
  
<EOS>
one
afternoon
,
Mrs.
Bretton
,
coax
her
from
her
usual
station
in
a
corner
,
have
lift
her
into
the
window
-
seat
,
and
,
by
way
of
occupy
her
attention
,
tell
her
to
watch
the
passenger
and
count
how
many
lady
should
go
down
the
street
in
a
give
time
.
<EOS>
She
have
sit
listlessly
,
hardly
look
,
and
not
count
,
when
 
my
eye
be
fix
on
her
 
<EOS>
I
witness
in
its
iris
and
pupil
a
startling
transfiguration
.
<EOS>
these
sudden
,
dangerous
nature
 
_
sensitive
_
as
they
be
call
 
offer
many
a
curious
spectacle
to
those
whom
a
cooler
temperament
have
secure
from
participation
in
their
angular
vagary
.
<EOS>
the
fixed
and
heavy
gaze
swum
,
tremble
,
then
glitter
in
fire
;
the
small
,
overcast
brow
clear
;
the
trivial
and
dejected
feature
light
up
;
the
sad
countenance
vanish
,
and
in
its
place
appear
a
sudden
eagerness
,
an
intense
expectancy
.
<EOS>
"
It
_
be
_
!
<EOS>
"
be
her
word
.
  
<EOS>
like
a
bird
or
a
shaft
,
or
any
other
swift
thing
,
she
be
go
from
the
room
<EOS>
,
how
she
get
the
house
-
door
open
I
can
not
tell
;
probably
it
may
be
ajar
;
perhaps
Warren
be
in
the
way
and
obey
her
behest
,
which
would
be
impetuous
enough
.
<EOS>
I
 
watch
calmly
from
the
window
 
<EOS>
see
her
,
in
her
black
frock
and
tiny
braid
apron
<EOS>
(
to
pinafore
she
have
an
antipathy
)
,
dart
half
the
length
of
the
street
;
and
,
as
I
be
on
the
point
of
turning
,
and
quietly
announce
to
Mrs.
Bretton
that
the
child
be
run
out
mad
,
and
ought
instantly
to
be
pursue
<EOS>
,
I
see
her
catch
up
,
and
rapt
at
once
from
my
cool
observation
,
and
from
the
wonder
stare
of
the
passenger
.
<EOS>
a
gentleman
have
do
this
good
turn
,
and
now
,
cover
her
with
his
cloak
,
advance
to
restore
her
to
the
house
whence
he
have
see
her
issue
.
  
<EOS>
I
conclude
he
would
leave
her
in
a
servant
's
charge
and
withdraw
;
but
he
enter
:
have
tarry
a
little
while
below
,
he
come
up
-
stair
.
  
<EOS>
His
reception
immediately
explain
that
he
be
know
to
Mrs.
Bretton
.
<EOS>
She
recognise
him
;
she
greet
him
,
and
yet
she
be
flutter
,
surprised
,
take
unaware
.
<EOS>
Her
look
and
manner
be
even
expostulatory
;
and
in
reply
to
these
,
rather
than
her
word
,
he
say
,
 
"
I
could
not
help
it
,
madam
:
<EOS>
I
find
it
impossible
to
leave
the
country
without
see
with
my
own
eye
how
she
settle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
will
unsettle
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
.
<EOS>
and
how
be
papa
's
little
Polly
?
"
  
<EOS>
this
question
he
address
to
Paulina
,
as
he
sit
down
and
place
her
gently
on
the
ground
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
Polly
's
papa
?
"
be
the
reply
,
as
she
lean
on
his
knee
,
and
gaze
up
into
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
noisy
,
not
a
wordy
scene
:
for
that
I
be
thankful
;
but
it
be
a
scene
of
feel
too
brimful
,
and
which
,
because
the
cup
do
not
foam
up
high
or
furiously
overflow
<EOS>
,
only
oppress
one
the
more
.
<EOS>
on
all
occasion
of
vehement
,
unrestrained
expansion
,
a
sense
of
disdain
or
ridicule
come
to
the
weary
spectator
's
relief
;
whereas
I
have
ever
feel
most
burdensome
that
sort
of
sensibility
which
bend
of
its
own
will
,
a
giant
slave
under
the
sway
of
good
sense
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Home
be
a
stern
-
feature
 
<EOS>
perhaps
I
should
rather
say
,
a
hard
-
featured
man
:
his
forehead
be
knotty
,
and
his
cheekbone
be
mark
and
prominent
.
<EOS>
the
character
of
his
face
be
quite
Scotch
;
but
there
be
feel
in
his
eye
,
and
emotion
in
his
now
agitate
countenance
.
<EOS>
His
northern
accent
in
speak
harmonise
with
his
physiognomy
.
<EOS>
He
be
at
once
proud
-
looking
and
homely
-
look
.
<EOS>
He
lay
his
hand
on
the
child
's
uplifted
head
.
<EOS>
She
say
 
"
Kiss
Polly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
kiss
her
.
<EOS>
I
wish
she
would
utter
some
hysterical
cry
,
so
that
I
may
get
relief
and
be
at
ease
.
<EOS>
She
make
wonderfully
little
noise
:
she
seem
to
have
get
what
she
want
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
all
_
she
want
,
and
to
be
in
a
trance
of
content
.
<EOS>
neither
in
mien
nor
in
feature
be
this
creature
like
her
sire
,
and
yet
she
be
of
his
strain
<EOS>
:
her
mind
have
be
fill
from
his
,
as
the
cup
from
the
flagon
.
  
<EOS>
indisputably
,
Mr.
Home
own
manly
self
-
control
,
however
he
may
secretly
feel
on
some
matter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
polly
,
"
he
say
,
look
down
on
his
little
girl
,
"
go
into
the
hall
;
you
will
see
papa
's
great
-
coat
lie
on
a
chair
;
put
your
hand
into
the
pocket
,
you
will
find
a
pocket
-
handkerchief
there
;
bring
it
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
obey
;
go
and
return
deftly
and
nimbly
.
<EOS>
He
be
talk
to
Mrs.
Bretton
when
she
come
back
,
and
she
wait
with
the
handkerchief
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
picture
,
in
its
way
,
to
see
her
,
with
her
tiny
stature
,
and
trim
,
neat
shape
,
stand
at
his
knee
.
<EOS>
see
that
he
continue
to
talk
,
apparently
unconscious
of
her
return
,
she
take
his
hand
,
open
the
unresisting
finger
,
insinuate
into
them
the
handkerchief
,
and
close
them
upon
it
one
by
one
.
<EOS>
He
still
seem
not
to
see
or
to
feel
her
;
but
by
-
and
-
by
,
he
lift
her
to
his
knee
;
she
nestle
against
him
,
and
though
neither
look
at
nor
speak
to
the
other
for
an
hour
follow
,
I
suppose
both
be
satisfied
.
  
<EOS>
during
tea
,
the
minute
thing
's
movement
and
behaviour
give
,
as
usual
,
full
occupation
to
the
eye
.
<EOS>
first
she
direct
Warren
,
as
he
place
the
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
put
papa
's
chair
here
,
and
mine
near
it
,
between
papa
and
Mrs.
Bretton
<EOS>
:
_
I
_
must
hand
his
tea
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
take
her
own
seat
,
and
beckon
with
her
hand
to
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
near
me
,
as
if
we
be
at
home
,
papa
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
again
,
as
she
intercept
his
cup
in
passing
,
and
would
stir
the
sugar
,
and
put
in
the
cream
herself
,
"
I
always
do
it
for
you
at
home
;
papa
:
<EOS>
nobody
could
do
it
as
well
,
not
even
your
own
self
.
"
  
<EOS>
throughout
the
meal
she
continue
her
attention
:
rather
absurd
they
be
.
<EOS>
the
sugar
-
tong
be
too
wide
for
one
of
her
hand
,
and
she
have
to
use
both
in
wield
them
;
the
weight
of
the
silver
cream
-
ewer
,
the
bread
-
and
-
butter
plate
,
the
very
cup
and
saucer
,
task
her
insufficient
strength
and
dexterity
;
but
she
would
lift
this
,
hand
that
,
and
luckily
contrive
through
it
all
to
break

I
think
her
a
little
busy

body

but
her
father
,
blind
like
other
parent

seem
perfectly
content
to
let
her
wait
on
him
,
and
even
wonderfully
soothe
by
her
office
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
my
comfort
!
"
<EOS>
he
could
not
help
say
to
Mrs.
Bretton
.
<EOS>
that
lady
have
her
own
"
comfort
"
and
nonpareil
on
a
much
large
scale
,
and
,
for
the
moment
,
absent
;
so
she
sympathise
with
his
foible
.
  
<EOS>
this
second
"
comfort

come
on
the
stage
in
the
course
of
the
evening

<EOS>
I
know
this
day
have
be
fix
for
his
return
,
and
be
aware
that
Mrs.
Bretton
have
be
expect
him
through
all
its
hour
.
<EOS>
We
be
seat
round
the
fire
,
after
tea
,
when
Graham
join
our
circle
:
I
should
rather
say
,
break
it
up
 
for
,
of
course
,
his
arrival
make
a
bustle
;
and
then
,
as
Mr.
Graham
be
fast
,
there
be
refreshment
to
be
provide
.
<EOS>
He
and
Mr.
Home
meet
as
old
acquaintance
;
of
the
little
girl
he
take
no
notice
for
a
time
.
  
<EOS>
His
meal
over
,
and
numerous
question
from
his
mother
answer
,
he
turn
from
the
table
to
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
opposite
where
he
have
place
himself
be
seat
Mr.
Home
,
and
at
his
elbow
,
the
child
.
<EOS>
when
I
say
_
child
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
use
an
inappropriate
and
undescriptive
term
 
a
term
suggest
any
picture
rather
than
that
of
the
demure
little
person
in
a
mourning
frock
and
white
chemisette
,
that
may
just
have
fit
a
good
-
sized
doll
 
perch
now
on
a
high
chair
beside
a
stand
,
whereon
be
her
toy
work
-
box
of
white
varnish
wood
,
and
hold
in
her
hand
a
shred
of
a
handkerchief
,
which
she
be
profess
to
hem
,
and
at
which
she
bore
perseveringly
with
a
needle
,
that
in
her
finger
seem
almost
a
skewer
,
prick
herself
ever
and
anon
,
mark
the
cambric
with
a
track
of
minute
red
dot
;
occasionally
start
when
the
perverse
weapon
 
<EOS>
swerving
from
her
control
 
inflict
a
deep
stab
than
usual
;
but
still
silent

diligent

absorb
,
womanly

<EOS>
Graham
be
at
that
time
a
handsome
,
faithless
-
look
youth
of
sixteen
.
<EOS>
I
say
faithless
-
look
,
not
because
he
be
really
of
a
very
perfidious
disposition
,
but
because
the
epithet
strike
me
as
proper
to
describe
the
fair
,
celtic
(
not
Saxon
)
character
of
his
good
look
;
his
waved
light
auburn
hair
,
his
supple
symmetry
,
his
smile
frequent
,
and
destitute
neither
of
fascination
nor
of
subtlety

in
no
bad
sense

sometimes
silent

sometimes
receive

answer
Mrs.

which
be
just
of

for
a

in
his
morbid
mood
 
not

sympathetic

yet
not

uncongenial

sensible

with

touch

business

<EOS>
Graham
would
endeavour
to
seduce
her
attention
by
open
his

display
its
multifarious
content

gaily

have
amass

nor

this
powerful
temptation
wholly
unavaile

<EOS>
her
eye

furtively
raise
from

cast
many
a
peep

Ere

discomfited
;
he
fling
himself
on
a
sofa
,
and
rest
his
head
against
the
cushion
,
lie
like
one
in
pain
.
<EOS>
polly
,
find
him
silent
,
presently
peep
at
him
.
<EOS>
His
eye
and
face
be
cover
with
his
hand
.
<EOS>
She
turn
on
her
father
's
knee
,
and
gaze
at
her
foe
anxiously
and
long
.
<EOS>
Graham
groan
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
what
be
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
she
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
ask
him
,
Polly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
he
hurt
?
"
<EOS>
(
groan
second
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
He
make
a
noise
as
if
he
be
,
"
say
Mr.
Home
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
"
suggest
Graham
,
feebly
,
"
I
think
you
have
better
send
for
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
oh
my
eye
!
"
<EOS>
(
renew
silence
,
break
only
by
sigh
from
Graham
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
be
to
become
blind
 
?
"
suggest
this
last
.
  
<EOS>
His
chastiser
could
not
bear
the
suggestion
.
<EOS>
She
be
beside
him
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
see
your
eye
:
I
do
not
mean
to
touch
it
,
only
your
mouth
;
and
I
do
not
think
I
hit
so
_
very
_
hard

"
  
<EOS>
Silence
answer
her
.
<EOS>
Her
feature
work
,
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
;
I
be
sorry
!
"
  
<EOS>
then
succeed
emotion
,
faltering
;
weeping
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
do
try
that
child
,
Graham
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bretton
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
nonsense
,
my
pet

"
cry
Mr.
Home
.
  
<EOS>
and
Graham
once
more
snatch
her
aloft
,
and
she
again
punish
him
;
and
while
she
pull
his
lion
's
lock
,
term
him
 
"
the
naughtiest
,
rude
,
bad
,
untruest
person
that
ever
be

"
     
<EOS>
on
the
morning
of
Mr.
Home
's
departure
,
he
and
his
daughter
have
some
conversation
in
a
window
-
recess
by
themselves
;
I
hear
part
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Could
not
I
pack
my
box
and
go
with
you
,
papa
?
"
<EOS>
she
whisper
earnestly
.
  
<EOS>
He
shake
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Should
I
be
a
trouble
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Polly
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
because
I
be
little
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
you
be
little
and
tender
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
great
,
strong
people
that
should
travel
.
<EOS>
but
do
not
look
sad
,
my
little
girl
;
it
break
my
heart
.
<EOS>
Papa
,
will
soon
come
back
to
his
Polly

<EOS>
"
  
"
indeed
,
indeed
,
I
be
not
sad
,
scarcely
at
all

"
  
<EOS>
"
Polly
would
be
sorry
to
give
papa
pain
;
<EOS>
would
she
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
sorry
than
sorry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
Polly
must
be
cheerful
<EOS>
:
not
cry
at
parting
;
not
fret
afterwards
.
<EOS>
She
must
look
forward
to
meet
again
,
and
try
to
be
happy
meanwhile
.
<EOS>
Can
she
do
this
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
try
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
she
will

<EOS>
farewell
,
then
.
<EOS>
It
be
time
to
go

"
  
<EOS>
"
_
now

just
_

"
just

<EOS>
She
hold
up
quivering
lip
.
<EOS>
Her
father
sob
,
but
she
,
I
remark
,
do
not
.
<EOS>
have
put
her
down
,
he
shake
hand
with
the
rest
present
,
and
depart
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
street
-
door
close
,
she
drop
on
her
knee
at
a
chair
with
a
cry
 
"
Papa
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
low
and
long
;
a
sort
of
"
why
hast
thou
forsake
me
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
during
an
ensue
space
of
some
minute
,
I
perceive
she
endure
agony
.
<EOS>
She
go
through
,
in
that
brief
interval
of
her
infant
life
,
emotion
such
as
some
never
feel
;
it
be
in
her
constitution
:
she
would
have
more
of
such
instant
if
she
live
.
<EOS>
nobody
speak
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
,
be
a
mother
,
shed
a
tear
or
two
.
<EOS>
Graham
,
who
be
write
,
lift
up
his
eye
and
gaze
at
her
.
<EOS>
I
,
Lucy
Snowe
,
be
calm
.
  
<EOS>
the
little
creature
,
thus
leave
unharassed
,
do
for
herself
what
none
other
could
do
 
contend
with
an
intolerable
feeling
;
and
,
ere
long
,
in
some
degree
,
repress
it
.
<EOS>
that
day
she
would
accept
solace
from
none
;
nor
the
next
day
:
she
grow
more
passive
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
third
evening
,
as
she
sit
on
the
floor
,
worn
and
quiet
,
Graham
,
come
in
,
take
her
up
gently
,
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
resist
:
she
rather
nestle
in
his
arm
,
as
if
weary
.
<EOS>
when
he
sit
down
,
she
lay
her
head
against
him
;
in
a
few
minute
she
sleep
;
he
carry
her
upstairs
to
bed
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
surprised
that
,
the
next
morning
,
the
first
thing
she
demand
be
,
"
<EOS>
where
be
Mr.
Graham
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
happen
that
Graham
be
not
come
to
the
breakfast
-
table
;
he
have
some
exercise
to
write
for
that
morning
's
class
,
and
have
request
his
mother
to
send
a
cup
of
tea
into
the
study
.
<EOS>
polly
volunteer
to
carry
it
:
she
must
be
busy
about
something
,
look
after
somebody
.
<EOS>
the
cup
be
entrust
to
her
;
for
,
if
restless
,
she
be
also
careful
.
<EOS>
as
the
study
be
opposite
the
breakfast
-
room
,
the
door
face
across
the
passage
,
my
eye
follow
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
,
pause
on
the
threshold
.
  
<EOS>
"
Writing
,
"
say
Graham
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
not
you
come
to
take
breakfast
with
your
mamma
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
too
busy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
want
any
breakfast
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
of
course
.
"
  
"
there
,
then
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
she
deposit
the
cup
on
the
carpet
,
like
a
jailor
put
a
prisoner
's
pitcher
of
water
through
his
cell
-
door
,
and
retreat
.
<EOS>
presently
she
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
will
you
have
besides
tea
 
what
to
eat
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
anything
good
.
<EOS>
bring
me
something
particularly
nice
;
that
be
a
kind
little
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
come
back
to
Mrs.
Bretton
.
  
<EOS>
"
please
,
madam
,
send
your
boy
something
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
choose
for
him
,
Polly
;
what
shall
my
boy
have
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
select
a
portion
of
whatever
be
good
on
the
table
;
and
,
ere
long
,
come
back
with
a
whisper
request
for
some
marmalade
,
which
be
not
there
.
<EOS>
have
get
it
,
however
,
(
for
Mrs.
Bretton
refuse
the
pair
nothing
)
,
Graham
be
shortly
after
hear
laud
her
to
the
sky
;
promise
that
,
when
he
have
a
house
of
his
own
,
she
should
be
his
housekeeper
,
and
perhaps
 
if
she
show
any
culinary
genius
 
his
cook
;
and
,
as
she
do
not
return
,
and
I
go
to
look
after
her
<EOS>
,
I
find
Graham
and
her
breakfast
_
tête
-
à
-
tête
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
she
stand
at
his
elbow
,
and
share
his
fare
:
except
the
marmalade
,
which
she
delicately
refuse
to
touch
,
l
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
it
should
appear
that
she
have
procure
it
as
much
on
her
own
account
as
his
.
<EOS>
She
constantly
evince
these
nice
perception
and
delicate
instinct
.
  
<EOS>
the
league
of
acquaintanceship
thus
strike
up
be
not
hastily
dissolve
;
on
the
contrary
,
it
appear
that
time
and
circumstance
serve
rather
to
cement
than
loosen
it
.
<EOS>
Ill
-
assimilate
as
the
two
be
in
age
,
sex
,
pursuit
,
&
c.
,
they
somehow
find
a
great
deal
to
say
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
as
to
Paulina
,
I
observe
that
her
little
character
never
properly
come
out
,
except
with
young
Bretton
.
<EOS>
as
she
get
settle
,
and
accustom
to
the
house
,
she
prove
tractable
enough
with
Mrs.
Bretton
;
but
she
would
sit
on
a
stool
at
that
lady
's
foot
all
day
long
,
learn
her
task
,
or
sewing
,
or
draw
figure
with
a
pencil
on
a
slate
,
and
never
kindle
once
to
originality
,
or
show
a
single
gleam
of
the
peculiarity
of
her
nature
.
<EOS>
I
cease
to
watch
her
under
such
circumstance
:
she
be
not
interesting
.
<EOS>
but
the
moment
Graham
's
knock
sound
of
an
evening
,
a
change
occur
;
she
be
instantly
at
the
head
of
the
staircase
.
<EOS>
usually
her
welcome
be
a
reprimand
or
a
threat
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
wipe
your
shoe
properly
on
the
mat
.
<EOS>
I
shall
tell
your
mamma
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
little
busybody
!
<EOS>
be
you
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
 
<EOS>
and
you
can
not
reach
me
<EOS>
:
I
be
high
up
than
you
"
(
peep
between
the
rail
of
the
banister
;
she
could
not
look
over
them
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
polly
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
boy
!
"
<EOS>
(
such
be
one
of
her
term
for
him
,
adopt
in
imitation
of
his
mother
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
fit
to
faint
with
fatigue
,
"
declare
Graham
,
lean
against
the
passage
-
wall
in
seem
exhaustion
.
"
<EOS>
Dr.
Digby
"
(
the
headmaster
)
"
have
quite
knock
me
up
with
overwork
.
<EOS>
just
come
down
and
help
me
to
carry
up
my
book
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
you
be
cunne
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
,
polly
 
it
be
positive
fact
.
<EOS>
I
be
as
weak
as
a
rush
.
<EOS>
come
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
eye
be
quiet
like
the
cat
's
,
but
you
will
spring
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
spring
?
<EOS>
nothing
of
the
kind
:
it
be
not
in
me
.
<EOS>
come
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
may
 
if
you
will
promise
not
to
touch
 
not
to
snatch
me
up
,
and
not
to
whirl
me
round
.
"
  
"
I
?
<EOS>
I
could
not
do
it
!
"
<EOS>
(
sink
into
a
chair
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
then
put
the
book
down
on
the
first
step
,
and
go
three
yard
off
"
  
this
be
do
,
she
descend
warily
,
and
not
take
her
eye
from
the
feeble
Graham
.
<EOS>
of
course
her
approach
always
galvanize
him
to
new
and
spasmodic
life
:
the
game
of
romp
be
sure
to
be
exact
.
<EOS>
sometimes
she
would
be
angry
;
sometimes
the
matter
be
allow
to
pass
smoothly
,
and
we
could
hear
her
say
as
she
lead
him
up
-
stair
:
"
now
,
my
dear
boy
,
come
and
take
your
tea
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
must
want
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
sufficiently
comical
to
observe
her
as
she
sit
beside
Graham
,
while
he
take
that
meal
.
<EOS>
in
his
absence
she
be
a
still
personage
,
but
with
him
the
most
officious
,
fidgety
little
body
possible
.
<EOS>
I
often
wish
she
would
mind
herself
and
be
tranquil
;
but
no
 
herself
be
forget
in
him
:
he
could
not
be
sufficiently
well
wait
on
,
nor
carefully
enough
look
after
;
he
be
more
than
the
Grand
Turk
in
her
estimation
.
<EOS>
She
would
gradually
assemble
the
various
plate
before
him
,
and
,
when
one
would
suppose
all
he
could
possibly
desire
be
within
his
reach
,
she
would
find
out
something
else
:
"
madam
,
"
she
would
whisper
to
Mrs.
Bretton
,
 
"
perhaps
your
son
would
like
a
little
cake
 
<EOS>
sweet
cake
<EOS>
,
you
know
 
there
be
some
in
there
"
(
point
to
the
sideboard
cupboard
)
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
,
as
a
rule
,
disapprove
of
sweet
cake
at
tea
,
but
still
the
request
be
urge
,
 
<EOS>
"
one
little
piece
 
<EOS>
only
for
him
 
as
he
go
to
school
:
girl
 
such
as
me
and
Miss
Snowe
 
do
not
need
treat
,
but
_
he
_
would
like
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Graham
do
like
it
very
well
,
and
almost
always
get
it
.
<EOS>
to
do
him
justice
,
he
would
have
share
his
prize
with
her
to
whom
he
owe
it
;
but
that
be
never
allow
:
to
insist
,
be
to
ruffle
her
for
the
evening
.
<EOS>
to
stand
by
his
knee
,
and
monopolize
his
talk
and
notice
,
be
the
reward
she
want
 
not
a
share
of
the
cake
.
  
<EOS>
with
curious
readiness
do
she
adapt
herself
to
such
theme
as
interested
him
.
<EOS>
one
would
have
think
the
child
have
no
mind
or
life
of
her
own
,
but
must
necessarily
live
,
move
,
and
have
her
be
in
another
:
now
that
her
father
be
take
from
her
,
she
nestle
to
Graham
,
and
seem
to
feel
by
his
feeling
:
to
exist
in
his
existence
.
<EOS>
She
learn
the
name
of
all
his
schoolfellow
in
a
trice
:
she
get
by
heart
their
character
as
give
from
his
lip
:
a
single
description
of
an
individual
seem
to
suffice
.
<EOS>
She
never
forget
,
or
<EOS>
confuse
identity
:
she
would
talk
with
him
the
whole
evening
about
people
she
have
never
see
,
and
appear
completely
to
realise
their
aspect
,
manner
,
and
disposition
.
<EOS>
some
she
learn
to
mimic
:
an
under
-
master
,
who
be
an
aversion
of
young
Bretton
's
,
have
,
it
seem
,
some
peculiarity
,
which
she
catch
up
in
a
moment
from
Graham
's
representation
,
and
rehearse
for
his
amusement
;
this
,
however
,
Mrs.
Bretton
disapprove
and
forbid
.
  
<EOS>
the
pair
seldom
quarrel
;
yet
once
a
rupture
occur
,
in
which
her
feeling
receive
a
severe

<EOS>
one
day
Graham
,
on
the
occasion
of
his
birthday
,
have
some
friend
 
lad
of
his
own
age
 
to
dine
with
him
.
<EOS>
Paulina
take
much
interest
in
the
coming
of
these
friend
;
she
have
frequently
hear
of
them
;
they
be
amongst
those
of
whom
Graham
oftenest
speak
.
<EOS>
after
dinner
,
the
young
gentleman
be
leave
by
themselves
in
the
dining
-
room
,
where
they
soon
become
very
merry
and
make
a
good
deal
of
noise
.
<EOS>
chance
to
pass
through
the
hall
,
I
find
Paulina
sit
alone
on
the
low
step
of
the
staircase
,
her
eye
fix
on
the
glossy
panel
of
the
dining
-
room
door
,
where
the
reflection
of
the
hall
-
lamp
be
shine
;
her
little
brow
knit
in
anxious
,
meditation
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
you
think
about
,
Polly
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
nothing
particular
<EOS>
;
only
I
wish
that
door
be
clear
glass
 
<EOS>
that
I
may
see
through
it
.
<EOS>
the
boy
seem
very
cheerful
,
and
I
want
to
go
to
them
:
I
want
to
be
with
Graham
,
and
watch
his
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
hinder
you
from
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
afraid
:
but
may
I
try
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
May
I
knock
at
the
door
,
and
ask
to
be
let
in
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
perhaps
they
may
not
object
to
have
her
as
a
playmate
,
and
therefore
encourage
the
attempt
.
  
<EOS>
She
knock
 
too
faintly
at
first
to
be
hear
,
but
on
a
second
essay
the
door
unclosed
;
Graham
's
head
appear
;
he
look
in
high
spirit
,
but
impatient
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
want
,
<EOS>
you
little
monkey
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
to
come
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
indeed
?
<EOS>
as
if
I
would
be
trouble
with
you
!
<EOS>
away
to
mamma
and
Mistress
Snowe
,
and
tell
them
to
put
you
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
auburn
head
and
bright
flushed
face
vanish
,
 
the
door
shut
peremptorily
.
<EOS>
She
be
stunned
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
he
speak
so
?
<EOS>
He
never
speak
so
before
,
"
she
say
in
consternation
.
<EOS>
"
what
have
I
do
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
,
Polly
;
but
Graham
be
busy
with
his
school
-
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
he
like
them
better
than
me
!
<EOS>
He
turn
me
away
now
they
be
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
some
thought
of
console
her
,
and
of
improve
the
occasion
by
inculcate
some
of
those
maxim
of
philosophy
<EOS>
whereof
I
have
ever
a
tolerable
stock
ready
for
application
.
<EOS>
She
stop
me
,
however
,
by
put
her
finger
in
her
ear
at
the
first
word
I
utter
,
and
then
lie
down
on
the
mat
with
her
face
against
the
flag
;
nor
could
either
Warren
or
the
cook
root
her
from
that
position
:
she
be
allow
to
lie
,
therefore
,
till
she
choose
to
rise
of
her
own
accord
.
  
<EOS>
Graham
forget
his
impatience
the
same
evening
,
and
would
have
accost
her
as
usual
when
his
friend
be
go
,
but
she
wrench
herself
from
his
hand
;
her
eye
quite
flash
;
she
would
not
bid
him
good
-
night
;
she
would
not
look
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
the
next
day
he
treat
her
with
indifference
,
and
she
grow
like
a
bit
of
marble
.
<EOS>
the
day
after
,
he
tease
her
to
know
what
be
the
matter
;
her
lip
would
not
unclose
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
could
not
feel
real
anger
on
his
side
:
the
match
be
too
unequal
in
every
way
;
he
try
soothe
and
coaxing
.
<EOS>
"
why
be
she
so
angry
?
<EOS>
what
have
he
do
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
by
-
and
-
by
tear
answer
him
;
he
pet
her
,
and
they
be
friend
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
one
on
whom
such
incident
be
not
lose
<EOS>
:
I
remark
that
never
after
this
rebuff
do
she
seek
him
,
or
follow
him
,
or
in
any
way
solicit
his
notice
.
<EOS>
I
tell
her
once
to
carry
a
book
or
some
other
article
to
Graham
when
he
be
shut
up
in
his
study
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
wait
till
he
come
out
,
"
say
she
,
proudly
;
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
choose
to
give
him
the
trouble
of
rise
to
open
the
door

"
  
<EOS>
Young
Bretton
have
a
favourite
pony
on
which
he
often
ride
out
;
from
the
window
she
always
watch
his
departure
and
return
.
<EOS>
It
be
her
ambition
to
be
permit
to
have
a
ride
round
the
courtyard
on
this
pony
;
but
far
be
it
from
her
to
ask
such
a
favour
.
<EOS>
one
day
she
descend
to
the
yard
to
watch
him
dismount
;
as
she
lean
against
the
gate
,
the
longing
wish
for
the
indulgence
of
a
ride
glitter
in
her
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
Polly
,
will
you
have
a
canter
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Graham
,
half
carelessly
.
  
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
think
he
be
_
too
_
careless
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
thank
you
,
"
say
she
,
turn
away
with
the
utmost
coolness
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
better
,
"
pursue
he
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
like
it
,
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
think
I
should
care
a
fig
about
it
,
"
be
the
response
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
not
true
.
<EOS>
You
tell
Lucy
Snowe
you
long
to
have
a
ride
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
Snowe
be
a
_
tatter_-box
,
"
I
hear
her
say
(
her
imperfect
articulation
be
the
least
precocious
thing
she
have
about
her
)
;
and
with
this
;
she
walk
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Graham
,
come
in
soon
after
,
observe
to
his
mother
,
 
"
Mamma
,
I
believe
that
creature
be
a
changeling
:
she
be
a
perfect
cabinet
of
oddity
;
but
I
should
be
dull
without
her
:
she
amuse
me
a
great
deal
more
than
you
or
Lucy
Snowe
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
Miss
Snowe
,
"
say
Paulina
to
me
(
she
have
now
get
into
the
habit
of
occasionally
chat
with
me
when
we
be
alone
in
our
room
at
night
)
,
"
do
you
know
on
what
day
in
the
week
I
like
Graham
best
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
I
possibly
know
anything
so
strange
?
<EOS>
be
there
one
day
out
of
the
seven
when
he
be
otherwise
than
on
the
other
six
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
can
not
you
see
?
<EOS>
do
not
you
know
?
<EOS>
I
find
him
the
most
excellent
on
a
Sunday
;
then
we
have
him
the
whole
day
,
and
he
be
quiet
,
and
,
in
the
evening
,
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
so
_
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
observation
be
not
altogether
groundless
:
go
to
church
,
&
c.
,
keep
Graham
quiet
on
the
Sunday
,
and
the
evening
he
generally
dedicate
to
a
serene
,
though
rather
indolent
sort
of
enjoyment
by
the
parlour
fireside
.
<EOS>
He
would
take
possession
of
the
couch
,
and
then
he
would
call
Polly
.
  
<EOS>
Graham
be
a
boy
not
quite
as
other
boy
be
;
all
his
delight
do
not
lie
in
action
:
he
be
capable
of
some
interval
of
contemplation
;
he
could
take
a
pleasure
too
in
reading
,
nor
be
his
selection
of
book
<EOS>
wholly
indiscriminate
<EOS>
:
there
be
glimmering
of
characteristic
preference
,
and
even
of
instinctive
taste
in
the
choice
.
<EOS>
He
rarely
,
it
be
true
,
remark
on
what
he
read
,
but
I
have
see
him
sit
and
think
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
polly
,
be
near
him
,
kneel
on
a
little
cushion
or
the
carpet
,
a
conversation
would
begin
in
murmur
,
not
inaudible
,
though
subdue
.
<EOS>
I
catch
a
snatch
of
their
tenor
now
and
then
;
and
,
in
truth
,
some
influence
better
and
fine
than
that
of
every
day
,
seem
to
soothe
Graham
at
such
time
into
no
ungentle
mood
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
learn
any
hymn
this
week
,
Polly
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
learn
a
very
pretty
one
,
four
verse
long
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
say
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
speak
nicely
,
then
:
do
not
be
in
a
hurry
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
hymn
be
rehearse
,
or
rather
half
-
chant
,
in
a
little
singing
voice
,
Graham
would
take
exception
at
the
manner
,
and
proceed
to
give
a
lesson
in
recitation
.
<EOS>
She
be
quick
in
learning
,
apt
in
imitate
;
and
,
besides
,
her
pleasure
be
to
please
Graham
<EOS>
:
she
prove
a
ready
scholar
.
<EOS>
to
the
hymn
would
succeed
some
reading
 
perhaps
a
chapter
in
the
Bible
;
correction
be
seldom
require
here
,
for
the
child
could
read
any
simple
narrative
chapter
very
well
;
and
,
when
the
subject
be
such
as
she
could
understand
and
take
an
interest
in
,
her
expression
and
emphasis
be
something
remarkable
.
<EOS>
Joseph
cast
into
the
pit
;
the
calling
of
Samuel
;
Daniel
in
the
lion
'
den
;
 
these
be
favourite
passage
:
of
the
first
<EOS>
especially
she
seem
perfectly
to
feel
the
pathos
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Jacob
!
<EOS>
"
she
would
sometimes
say
,
with
quivering
lip
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
how
he
love
his
son
Joseph
!
<EOS>
as
much
,
"
she
once
add
 
"
as
much
,
<EOS>
Graham
,
as
I
love
you
:
if
you
be
to
die
"
(
and
she
re
-
open
the
book
,
seek
the
verse
,
and
read
)
,
"
I
should
refuse
to
be
comfort
,
and
go
down
into
the
grave
to
you
mourn
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
these
word
she
gather
Graham
in
her
little
arm
,
draw
his
long
-
tresse
head
towards
her
.
<EOS>
the
action
,
I
remember
,
strike
me
as
strangely
rash
;
excite
the
feeling
one
may
experience
on
see
an
animal
dangerous
by
nature
,
and
but
half
-
tame
by
art
,
too
heedlessly
fondle
.
<EOS>
not
that
I
fear
Graham
would
hurt
,
or
very
roughly
check
her
;
but
I
think
she
run
risk
of
incur
such
a
careless
,
impatient
repulse
,
as
would
be
bad
almost
to
her
than
a
blow
.
<EOS>
on
:
the
whole
,
however
,
these
demonstration
be
bear
passively
:
sometimes
even
a
sort
of
complacent
wonder
at
her
earnest
partiality
would
smile
not
unkindly
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
once
he
say
:
 
"
You
like
me
almost
as
well
as
if
you
be
my
little
sister
,
Polly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
I
_
do
_
like
you
,
"
say
she
;
"
I
_
do
_
like
you
very
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
long
allow
the
amusement
of
this
study
of
character
.
<EOS>
She
have
scarcely
be
at
Bretton
two
month
,
when
a
letter
come
from
Mr.
Home
,
signify
that
he
be
now
settle
amongst
his
maternal
kinsfolk
on
the
Continent
;
that
,
as
England
be
become
wholly
distasteful
to
him
,
he
have
no
thought
of
return
hither
,
perhaps
,
for
year
;
and
that
he
wish
his
little
girl
to
join
him
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
how
she
will
take
this
news
?
"
say
Mrs.
Bretton
,
when
she
have
read
the
letter
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
wonder
,
too
,
and
I
take
upon
myself
to
communicate
it
.
  
<EOS>
repair
to
the
drawing
-
room
 
in
which
calm
and
decorate
apartment
<EOS>
she
be
fond
of
be
alone
,
and
where
she
could
be
implicitly
trust
,
for
she
finger
nothing
,
or
rather
soil
nothing
she
finger
 
<EOS>
I
find
her
seat
,
like
a
little
Odalisque
,
on
a
couch
,
half
shade
by
the
droop
drapery
of
the
window
near
.
<EOS>
She
seem
happy
;
all
her
appliance
for
occupation
be
about
her
;
the
white
wood
workbox
,
a
shred
or
two
of
muslin
,
an
end
or
two
of
ribbon
collect
for
conversion
into
doll
-
millinery
.
<EOS>
the
doll
,
duly
night
-
cap
and
night
-
gown
,
lie
in
its
cradle
;
she
be
rock
it
to
sleep
,
with
an
air
of
the
most
perfect
faith
in
its
possession
of
sentient
and
somnolent
faculty

her
eye
,
at
the

be
engage

book

lie

me
.
<EOS>
a
mighty
,
goblin
creature
,
as
high
as
this
room
,
and
as
long
as
the
hall
;
but
not
a
fierce
,
flesh
-
eat
thing
,
Graham
think
.
<EOS>
He
believe
,
if
I
meet
one
in
a
forest
,
it
would
not
kill
me
,
unless
I
come
quite
in
its
way
;
when
it
would
trample
me
down
amongst
the
bush
,
as
I
may
tread
on
a
grasshopper
in
a
hayfield
without
know
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
thus
she
ramble
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
polly
,
"
I
interrupt
,
"
should
you
like
to
travel
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
just
yet
,
"
be
the
prudent
answer
;
"
but
perhaps
in
twenty
year
,
when
I
be
grow
a
woman
,
as
tall
as
Mrs.
Bretton
,
I
may
travel
with
Graham
.
<EOS>
We
intend
go
to
Switzerland
,
and
climb
Mount
Blanck
;
and
some
day
we
shall
sail
over
to
South
America
,
and
walk
to
the
top
of
Kim
-
kim
-
borazo
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
how
would
you
like
to
travel
now
,
if
your
papa
be
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
reply
 
not
give
till
after
a
pause
 
evince
one
of
those
unexpected
turn
of
temper
peculiar
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
the
good
of
talk
in
that
silly
way
?
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
mention
papa
?
<EOS>
what
be
papa
to
you
?
<EOS>
I
be
just
begin
to
be
happy
,
and
not
think
about
him
so
much
;
and
there
it
will
be
all
to
do
over
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
Her
lip
tremble
.
<EOS>
I
hasten
to
disclose
the
fact
of
a
letter
have
be
receive
,
and
to
mention
the
direction
give
that
she
and
Harriet
should
immediately
rejoin
this
dear
papa
.
"
<EOS>
now
,
Polly
,
be
you
not
glad
?
"
<EOS>
I
add
.
  
<EOS>
She
make
no
answer
.
<EOS>
She
drop
her
book
and
cease
to
rock
her
doll
;
she
gaze
at
me
with
gravity
and
earnestness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
not
you
like
to
go
to
papa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
"
she
say
at
last
in
that
trenchant
manner
she
usually
employ
in
speak
to
me
;
and
which
be
quite
different
from
that
she
use
with
Mrs.
Bretton
,
and
different
again
from
the
one
dedicate
to
Graham
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
ascertain
more
of
what
she
think
<EOS>
but
no
:
<EOS>
she
would
converse
no
more
.
<EOS>
hasten
to
Mrs.
Bretton
,
she
question
her
,
and
receive
the
confirmation
of
my
news
.
<EOS>
the
weight
and
importance
of
these
tiding
keep
her
perfectly
serious
the
whole
day
.
<EOS>
in
the
evening
,
at
the
moment
Graham
's
entrance
be
hear
below
,
I
find
her
at
my
side
.
<EOS>
She
begin
to
arrange
a
locket
-
ribbon
about
my
neck
,
she
displace
and
replace
the
comb
in
my
hair
;
while
thus
busy
,
Graham
enter
.
  
<EOS>
"
tell
him
by
-
and
-
by
,
"
she
whisper
;
"
tell
him
I
be
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
tea
-
time
I
make
the
desire
communication
.
<EOS>
Graham
,
it
chance
,
be
at
that
time
greatly
preoccupy
about
some
school
-
prize
,
for
which
he
be
compete
.
<EOS>
the
news
have
to
be
tell
twice
before
it
take
proper
hold
of
his
attention
,
and
even
then
he
dwell
on
it
but
momently
.
  
<EOS>
"
polly
go
?
<EOS>
what
a
pity
!
<EOS>
dear
little
Mousie
,
I
shall
be
sorry
to
lose
her
<EOS>
:
she
must
come
to
us
again
,
mamma
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
hastily
swallow
his
tea
,
he
take
a
candle
and
a
small
table
to
himself
and
his
book
,
and
be
soon
bury
in
study
.
  
<EOS>
"
Little
Mousie
"
creep
to
his
side
,
and
lie
down
on
the
carpet
at
his
foot
,
her
face
to
the
floor
;
mute
and
motionless
she
keep
that
post
and
position
till
bed
-
time
.
<EOS>
once
I
see
Graham
 
wholly
unconscious
of
her
proximity
 
push
her
with
his
restless
foot
.
<EOS>
She
recede
an
inch
or
two
.
<EOS>
a
minute
after
one
little
hand
steal
out
from
beneath
her
face
,
to
which
it
have
be
press
,
and
softly
caress
the
heedless
foot
.
<EOS>
when
summon
by
her
nurse
she
rise
and
depart
very
obediently
,
have
bid
us
all
a
subdued
good
-
night
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
that
I
dread
go
to
bed
,
an
hour
later
;
yet
I
certainly
go
with
an
unquiet
anticipation
that
I
should
find
that
child
in
no
peaceful
sleep
.
<EOS>
the
forewarning
of
my
instinct
be
but
fulfil
,
when
I
discover
her
,
all
cold
and
vigilant
,
perch
like
a
white
bird
on
the
outside
of
the
bed
.
<EOS>
I
scarcely
know
how
to
accost
her
;
she
be
not
to
be
manage
like
another
child
.
<EOS>
She
,
however
,
accost
me
.
<EOS>
as
I
close
the
door
,
and
put
the
light
on
the
dressing
-
table
,
she
turn
tome
with
these
word
:
 
"
I
can
not
 
_
can
not
_
sleep
;
and
in
this
way
I
can
not
 
_
can
not
_
live
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
ask
what
ail
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
dedful
miz
-
er
-
y
!
<EOS>
"
say
she
,
with
her
piteous
lisp
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
call
Mrs.
Bretton
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
downright
silly
,
"
be
her
impatient
reply
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
well
know
that
if
she
have
hear
Mrs.
Bretton
's
foot
approach
,
she
would
have
nestle
quiet
as
a
mouse
under
the
bedclothe
.
<EOS>
whilst
lavish
her
eccentricity
regardlessly
before
me
 
for
whom
she
profess
scarcely
the
semblance
of
affection
 
she
never
show
my
godmother
one
glimpse
of
her
inner
self
:
for
her
,
she
be
nothing
but
a
docile
,
somewhat
quaint
<EOS>
little
maiden
.
<EOS>
I
examine
her
;
her
cheek
be
crimson
;
her
dilate
eye
be
both
troubled
and
glowing
,
and
painfully
restless
:
in
this
state
it
be
obvious
she
must
not
be
leave
till
morning
.
<EOS>
I
guess
how
the
case
stand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
like
to
bid
Graham
good
-
night
again
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
not

<EOS>
She
at
once
stretch
out
her
little
arm
to
be
lift
.
<EOS>
fold
a
shawl
round
her
,
I
carry
her
back
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Graham
be
just
come
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
can
not
sleep
without
see
and
speak
to
you
once
more
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
She
do
not
like
the
thought
of
leave
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
spoil
her
,
"
say
he
,
take
her
from
me
with
good
humour
,
and
kiss
her
little
hot
face
and
burn
lip
.
<EOS>
"
polly
,
you
care
for
me
more
than
for

now
 
"
  
"
I

nothing

be
her
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
assure
to
the
contrary
,
again
kiss
,
restore
to
me
,
and
I
carry
her
away
;
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
not
soothe
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
think
she
could
listen
to
me
,
I
say
 
"
Paulina
,
you
should
not
grieve
that

much

It
must
be
so

"
  
<EOS>
Her
lifted
and
question
eye
ask
why
.
  
<EOS>
"
because
he
be
a
boy

you

sixteen

gay

assurance
soothe
her

in
her
anguish

<EOS>

,
"
I
continue
,

do
not

softly

to

this
one

I
assure
her
that
he
would
;
that

by
no

that

only
to
be
careful
for

I
return

hour
elapse

asleep

when
the
little
white
shape
once
more
lift
itself
in
the
crib

the
small
voice
ask

countenance
by

moonlight

cautiously

softly
wipe

glitter
eyelid

her

MISS

<EOS>
on
quit
Bretton
,
which
I
do
a
few
week
after
Paulina
's
departure
 
little
thinking
then
I
be
never
again
to
visit
it
;
never
more
to
tread
its
calm
old
street
 
<EOS>
I
betook
myself
home
,
have
be
absent
six
month
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
conjecture
that
I
be
of
course
glad
to
return
to
the
bosom
of
my
kindred

<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
the
amiable
conjecture
do
no
harm
,
and
may
therefore
be
safely
leave
uncontradicted
.
<EOS>
far
from
say
nay
,
indeed
,
I
will
permit
the
reader
to
picture
me
,
for
the
next
eight
year
,
as
a
bark
slumber
through
halcyon
weather
,
in
a
harbour
still
as
glass
 
<EOS>
the
steersman
stretch
on
the
little
deck
,
his
face
up
to
heaven

his
eye
close

<EOS>
bury
,
if
you
will
,
in
a
long
prayer
.
<EOS>
a
great
many
woman

be
suppose
to
pass
their
life
something
in
that
fashion
;
why
not
I
with
the
rest
?
  
<EOS>
picture
me
then
idle
,
basking
,
plump
,
and
happy
,
stretch
on
a
cushion
deck
,
warm
with
constant
sunshine
,
rock
by
breeze
indolently
soft
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
can
not
be
conceal
that
,
in
that
case
,
I
must
somehow
have
fall
overboard
,
or
that
there
must
have
be
wreck
at
last
.
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
too
well
remember
a
time
 
a
long
time
 
of
cold
,
of
danger
,
of
contention
.
<EOS>
to
this
hour
,
when
I
have
the
nightmare
,
it
repeat
the
rush
and
saltness
of
briny
wave
in
my
throat
,
and
their
icy
pressure
on
my
lung
.
<EOS>
I
even
know
there
be
a
storm
,
and
that
not
of
one
hour
nor
one
day

for
many
day

night
neither
sun
nor
star
appear
;
we
cast
with
our
own
hand
the
tackling
out
of
the
ship
;
a
heavy
tempest
lie
on
us
;
all
hope
that
we
should
be
save
be
take
away
.
<EOS>
in
fine
,
the
ship
be
lose
,
the
crew
perish
.
  
<EOS>
as
far
as
I
recollect
,
I
complain
to
no
one
about
these
trouble
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
to
whom
could
I
complain
?
<EOS>
of
Mrs.
Bretton
I
have
long
lose
sight
.
<EOS>
impediment
,
raise
by
other
,
have
,
year
ago
,
come
in
the
way
of
our
intercourse
,
and
cut
it
off
.
<EOS>
besides
,
time
have
bring
change
for
her
,
too
:
the
handsome
property
of
which
she
be
leave
guardian
for
her
son
,
and
which
have
be
chiefly
invest
in
some
joint
-
stock
undertaking
,
have
melt
,
it
be
say
,
to
a
fraction
of
its
original
amount
.
<EOS>
Graham
,
I
learn
from
incidental
rumour
,
have
adopt
a
profession
;
both
he
and
his
mother
be
go
from
Bretton
,
and
be
understand
to
be
now
in
London
.
<EOS>
thus
,
there
remain
no
possibility
of
dependence
on
other
;
to
myself
alone
could
I
look
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
that
I
be
of
a
self
-
reliant
or
active
nature
;
but
self
-
reliance
and
exertion
be
force
upon
me
by
circumstance
,
as
they
be
upon
thousand
besides
;
and
when
Miss
Marchmont
,
a
maiden
lady
of
our
neighbourhood
,
send
for
me
,
I
obey
her
behest
,
in
the
hope
that
she
may
assign
me
some
task
I
could
undertake
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Marchmont
be
a
woman
of
fortune
,
and
live
in
a
handsome
residence
;
but
she
be
a
rheumatic
cripple
,
impotent
,
foot
and
hand
,
and
have
be
so
for
twenty
year
.
<EOS>
She
always
sit
upstairs
:
her
drawing
-
room
adjoin
her
bed
-
room
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
hear
of
Miss
Marchmont
,
and
of
her
peculiarity
<EOS>
(
she
have
the
character
of
be
very
eccentric
)
,
but
till
now
have
never
see
her
.
<EOS>
I
find
her
a
furrowed
,
grey
-
haired
woman
,
grave
with
solitude
,
stern
with
long
affliction
,
irritable
also
,
and
perhaps
exact
.
<EOS>
It
seem
that
a
maid
,
or
rather
companion
,
who
have
wait
on
her
for
some
year
,
be
about
to
be
marry
;
and
she
,
hearing
of
my
bereave
lot
,
have
send
for
me
,
with
the
idea
that
I
may
supply
this
person
's
place
.
<EOS>
She
make
the
proposal
to
me
after
tea
,
as
she
and
I
sit
alone
by
her
fireside
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
be
an
easy
life
;
"
say
she
candidly
,
"
for
I
require
a
good
deal
of
attention
,
and
you
will
be
much
confine
;
yet
,
<EOS>
perhaps
,
contrast
with
the
existence
you
have
lately
lead
,
it
may
appear
tolerable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
reflect
.
<EOS>
of
course
it
ought
to
appear
tolerable
,
I
argue
inwardly
;
but
somehow
,
by
some
strange
fatality
,
it
would
not
.
<EOS>
to
live
here
,
in
this
close
room
,
the
watcher
of
suffer
 
sometimes
,
perhaps
,
the
butt
of
temper
 
through
all
that
be
to
come
of
my
youth
;
while
all
that
be
go
have
pass
,
to
say
the
least
,
not
blissfully
!
<EOS>
My
heart
sink
one
moment
,
then
it
revive
;
for
though
I
force
myself
to
_
realise
_
evil
,
I
think
I
be
too
prosaic
to
_
idealise
_
,
and
consequently
to
exaggerate
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
doubt
be
whether
I
should
have
strength
for
the
undertaking
,
"
I
observe
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
my
own
scruple
,
"
say
she
;
"
for
you
look
a
wear
-
out
creature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
see
myself
in
the
glass
,
in
my
mourning
-
dress
,
a
faded
,
hollow
-
eyed
vision
.
<EOS>
yet
I
think
little
of
the
wan
spectacle
.
<EOS>
the
blight
,
I
believe
,
be
chiefly
external
:
I
still
feel
life
at
life
's
source
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
else
have
you
in
view
 
anything
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
nothing
clear
as
yet
:
<EOS>
but
I
may
find
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
you
imagine
:
perhaps
you
be
right
.
<EOS>
try
your
own
method
,
then
;
and
if
it
do
not
succeed
,
test
mine
.
<EOS>
the
chance
I
have
offer
shall
be
leave
open
to
you
for
three
month
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
kind
.
<EOS>
I
tell
her
so
,
and
express
my
gratitude
.
<EOS>
while
I
be
speak
,
a
paroxysm
of
pain
come
on
.
<EOS>
I
minister
to
her
;
make
the
necessary
application
,
accord
to
her
direction
,
and
,
by
the
time
she
be
relieve
,
a
sort
of
intimacy
be
already
form
between
us
.
<EOS>
I
,
for
my
part
,
have
learn
from
the
manner
in
which
she
bear
this
attack
,
that
she
be
a
firm
,
patient
woman
(
patient
under
physical
pain
,
though
sometimes
perhaps
excitable
under
long
mental
canker
)
;
and
she
,
from
the
good
-
will
with
which
I
succour
her
,
discover
that
she
could
influence
my
sympathy
(
such
as
they
be
)
.
<EOS>
She
send
for
me
the
next
day
;
for
five
or
six
successive
day
she
claim
my
company
.
<EOS>
close
acquaintance
,
while
it
develop
both
fault
and
eccentricity
,
open
,
at
the
same
time
,
a
view
of
a
character
I
could
respect
.
<EOS>
stern
and
even
morose
as
she
sometimes
be
,
I
could
wait
on
her
and
sit
beside
her
with
that
calm
which
always
bless
us
when
we
be
sensible
that
our
manner
,
presence
,
contact
,
please
and
soothe
the
person
we
serve
.
<EOS>
even
when
she
scold
me
 
<EOS>
which
she
do
,
now
and
then
,
very
tartly
 
it
be
in
such
a
way
as
do
not
humiliate
,
and
leave
no
sting
;
it
be
rather
like
an
irascible
mother
rate
her
daughter
,
than
a
harsh
mistress
lecture
a
dependant
:
lecture
,
indeed
,
she
could
not
,
though
she
could
occasionally
storm
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
a
vein
of
reason
ever
run
through
her
passion
:
she
be
logical
even
when
fierce
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
a
grow
sense
of
attachment
begin
to
present
the
thought
of
stay
with
her
as
companion
in
quite
a
new
light
;
in
another
week
I
have
agree
to
remain
.
  
<EOS>
two
hot
,
close
room
thus
become
my
world
;
and
a
crippled
old
woman
,
my
mistress
,
my
friend
,
my
all
.
<EOS>
Her
service
be
my
duty
 
<EOS>
her
pain
,
my
suffering
 
her
relief
,
my
hope
 
her
anger
,
my
punishment
 
her
regard
,
my
reward
.
<EOS>
I
forgot
that
there
be
field
,
wood
,
river
,
sea
,
an
ever
-
change
sky
outside
the
steam
-
dim
lattice
of
this
sick
chamber
;
I
be
almost
content
to
forget
it
.
<EOS>
all
within
me
become
narrowed
to
my
lot
.
<EOS>
Tame
and
still
by
habit
,
discipline
by
destiny
<EOS>
,
I
demand
no
walk
in
the
fresh
air
;
my
appetite
need
no
more
than
the
tiny
mess
serve
for
the
invalid
.
<EOS>
in
addition
,
she
give
me
the
originality
of
her
character
to
study
:
the
steadiness
of
her
virtue
,
I
will
add
,
the
power
of
her
passion
,
to
admire
;
the
truth
of
her
feeling
to
trust
.
<EOS>
all
these
thing
she
have
,
and
for
these
thing
I
cling
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
for
these
thing
I
would
have
crawl
on
with
her
for
twenty
year
,
if
for
twenty
year
long
her
life
of
endurance
have
be
protract
.
<EOS>
but
another
decree
be
write
.
<EOS>
It
seem
I
must
be
stimulate
into
action
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
goad
,
drive
,
stung
,
force
to
energy
.
<EOS>
My
little
morsel
of
human
affection
,
which
I
prize
as
if
it
be
a
solid
pearl
,
must
melt
in
my
finger
and
slip
thence
like
a
dissolving
hailstone
.
<EOS>
My
small
adopt
duty
must
be
snatch
from
my
easily
contented
conscience
.
<EOS>
I
have
want
to
compromise
with
fate
:
to
escape
occasional
great
agony
by
submit
to
a
whole
life
of
privation
and
small
pain
.
<EOS>
fate
would
not
so
be
pacify
;
nor
would
Providence
sanction
this
shrink
sloth
and
cowardly
indolence
.
  
<EOS>
one
February
night
 
<EOS>
I
remember
it
<EOS>
well
 
there
come
a
voice
near
Miss
Marchmont
's
house
,
hear
by
every
inmate
,
but
translate
,
perhaps
,
only
by
one
.
<EOS>
after
a
calm
winter
,
storm
be
usher
in
the
spring
.
<EOS>
I
have
put
Miss
Marchmont
to
bed
;
I
sit
at
the
fireside
sewing
.
<EOS>
the
wind
be
wail
at
the
window
;
it
have
wail
all
day
;
but
,
as
night
deepen
,
it
take
a
new
tone
 
<EOS>
an
accent
keen
,
pierce
,
<EOS>
almost
articulate
to
the
ear
;
a
plaint
,
piteous
and
disconsolate
to
the
nerve
,
trill
in
every
gust
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
hush
!
<EOS>
hush
!
<EOS>
"
I
say
in
my
disturbed
mind
,
drop
my
work
,
and
make
a
vain
effort
to
stop
my
ear
against
that
subtle
,
search
cry
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
that
very
voice
ere
this
,
and
compulsory
observation
have
force
on
me
a
theory
as
to
what
it
bode
.
<EOS>
three
time
in
the
course
of
my
life
,
event
have
teach
me
that
these
strange
accent
in
the
storm
 
this
restless
,
hopeless
cry
 
<EOS>
denote
a
coming
state
of
the
atmosphere
unpropitious
to
life
.
<EOS>
epidemic
disease
,
I
believe
,
be
often
herald
by
a
gasping
,
sob
,
torment
,
long
-
lament
east
wind
.
<EOS>
hence
,
I
infer
,
arise
the
legend
of
the
Banshee
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
,
too
,
I
have
notice
 
but
be
not
philosopher
enough
to
know
whether
there
be
any
connection
between
the
circumstance
 
<EOS>
that
we
often
at
the
same
time
hear
of
disturbed
volcanic
action
in
distant
part
of
the
world
;
of
river
suddenly
rush
above
their
bank
;
and
of
strange
high
tide
flow
furiously
in
on
low
sea
-
coast
.
<EOS>
"
Our
globe
,
"
I
have
say
to
myself
,
"
seem
at
such
period
tear
and
disorder
;
the
feeble
amongst
us
wither
in
her
distemper
breath
,
rush
hot
from
steam
volcano
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
listen
and
tremble
;
Miss
Marchmont
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
about
midnight
,
the
storm
in
one
half
-
hour
fall
to
a
dead
calm
.
<EOS>
the
fire
,
which
have
be
burn
dead
,
glow
up
vividly
.
<EOS>
I
feel
the
air
change
,
and
become
keen
.
<EOS>
raise
blind
and
curtain
,
I
look
out
,
and
see
in
the
star
the
keen
sparkle
of
a
sharp
frost
.
  
<EOS>
turn
away
,
the
object
that
meet
my
eye
be
Miss
Marchmont
awake
,
lift
her
head
from
the
pillow
,
and
regard
me
with
unusual
earnestness
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
a
fine
night
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
.
  
<EOS>
I
reply
in
the
affirmative
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
,
"
she
say
;
"
for
I
feel
so
strong
,
so
well
.
<EOS>
raise
me
.
<EOS>
I
feel
young
to

night
,
"
she
continue
:
"
young
,
light
-
hearted
,
and
happy
.
<EOS>
what
if
my
complaint
be
about
to
take
a
turn
,
and
I
be
yet
destine
to
enjoy
health
?
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
miracle
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
these
be
not
the
day
of
miracle
,
"
I
think
to
myself
,
and
wonder
to
hear
her
talk
so
.
<EOS>
She
go
on
direct
her
conversation
to
the
past
,
and
seem
to
recall
its
incident
,
scene
,
and
personage
,
with
singular
vividness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
love
memory
to

night

"
<EOS>
she
say
:
"
I
prize
her
as
my
good
friend

<EOS>
She
be
just
now
give
me
a
deep
delight

she
be
bring
back
to
my
heart
,
in
warm

beautiful
life
,
reality
 
not
mere
empty
idea

but
what
be
once
reality
,
and
that
I
long
have
think
decay
,
dissolve
,
mix
in
with
grave

mould

<EOS>
I
possess
just
now
the
hour
,
the
thought
,
the
hope
of
my
youth
.
<EOS>
I
renew
the
love
of
my
life
 
its
only
love
 
almost
its
only
affection
;
for
I
be
not
a
particularly
good
woman
:
I
be
not
amiable
.
<EOS>
yet
I
have
have
my
feeling
,
strong
and
concentrated
;
and
these
feeling
have
their
object
;
which
,
in
its
single
self
,
be
dear
to
me
,
as
to
the
majority
of
man
and
woman
,
be
all
the
unnumbered
point
on
which
they
dissipate
their
regard
.
<EOS>
while
I
love
,
and
while
I
be
love
,
what
an
existence
I
enjoy
!
<EOS>
what
a
glorious
year
I
can
recall
 
how
bright
it
come
back
to
me
!
<EOS>
what
a
live
spring
 
<EOS>
what
a
warm
,
glad
summer
 
<EOS>
what
soft
moonlight
,
silver
the
autumn
evening
 
<EOS>
what
strength
of
hope
under
the
ice

bind
water
and
frost

hoar
field
of
that
year

winter
!
<EOS>
through
that
year
my
heart
live
with
Frank

heart

<EOS>
o
my
noble
Frank
 
<EOS>
my
faithful
Frank
 
<EOS>
my

good

Frank

<EOS>
so
much
well
than
myself
 
his
standard
in

so
much

<EOS>
this
I
can
now
see
and
say
:
if
few
woman
have
suffer
as
I
do
in
his
loss
,
few
have
enjoy
what
I
do
in
his
love

<EOS>
It
be
a
far
well
kind
of
love
than
common
;
I
have
no
doubt
about
it
or
him
:
it
be
such
a
love
as
honour
,
protect
,
and
elevated
,
no
less
than
it
gladden
her
to
whom
it
be

<EOS>
let
me
now
ask
,
just
at
this
moment
,
when
my
mind
be
so
strangely
clear
,
 
let
me
reflect
why
it
be
take
from
me
?
<EOS>
for
what
crime
be
I
condemn
,
after
twelve
month
of
bliss
,
to
undergo
thirty
year
of
sorrow
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
she
continue
after
a
pause
:
"
I
can
not
 
_
can
not
_
see
the
reason

yet
at
this
hour
I
can
say
with
sincerity

what
I

before

Inscrutable
God
,
Thy
will
be
do
!
<EOS>
and
at
this
moment
I
can
believe
that
death
will
restore
me
to
Frank
.
<EOS>
I
never
believe
it
till
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
dead
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
in
a
low
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
girl
,
"
she
say
,
"
one
happy
Christmas
Eve
I
dress
and
decorate
myself
,
expect
my
lover
,
very
soon
to
be
my
husband
,
would
come
that
night
to
visit
me
.
<EOS>
I
sit
down
to
wait
.
<EOS>
once
more
I
see
that
moment
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
snow
twilight
steal
through
the
window
over
which
the
curtain
be
not
drop
,
for
I
design
to
watch
him
ride
up
the
white
walk
;
I
see
and
feel
the
soft
firelight
warm
me
,
play
on
my
silk
dress
,
and
fitfully
show
me
my
own
young
figure
in
a
glass
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
moon
of
a
calm
winter
night
,
float
full
,
clear
,
and
cold
,
over
the
inky
mass
of
shrubbery
,
and
the
silvered
turf
of
my
ground
.
<EOS>
I
wait
,
with
some
impatience
in
my
pulse
,
but
no
doubt
in
my
breast
.
<EOS>
the
flame
have
die
in
the
fire
,
but
it
be
a
bright
mass
yet
;
the
moon
be
mount
high
,
but
she
be
still
visible
from
the
lattice
;
the
clock
near
ten
;
he
rarely
tarry
later
than
this
,
but
once
or
twice
he
have
be
delay
so
long
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
he
for
once
fail
me
?
<EOS>
no
 
not
even
for
once
;
and
now
he
be
come
 
and
come
fast
-
to
atone
for
lose
time
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Frank
!
<EOS>
you
furious
rider
,

I
say
inwardly
,
listen
gladly
,
yet
anxiously
,
to
his
approach
gallop

there

I

him

I

be
so
confused

I
see

but
I
be
kneel
down
in
the
snow
,
beside
something
that
lie
there
 
something
that
I
have
see
drag
along
the
ground
 
something
that
sigh
,
that
groan
on
my

as
I
lift

draw
it

<EOS>
He
be
not
dead

he

unconscious

<EOS>
I
have
him
carry
in
;
I
refuse
to
be
order
about
and
thrust
from
him

<EOS>
I
be
quite
collect
enough

not

to
be
my

the
mistress
of
other

They
have
begin
by
try

treat
me
like
a
child

as
they
always
do
with
people
strike
by
God

I
give
place
to
none

the
surgeon

when
he
have
do
what
he
could
,
I
take
my
die
Frank
to
myself

<EOS>
He
have
strength
to
fold
me
in

power

speak
my

my
calamity

soft

amiable
nature

would
have
refine

saintliness

of
strong

evil

they
would
have
make
demon

as
for
me
,
I
have
only
be
a
woe
-
strike
and
selfish
woman

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
do
much
good

I
say

for
she

note

<EOS>
"
I
have
not
withhold
money
,
you
mean
,
where
it
could
assuage
affliction
.
<EOS>
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
It
cost
me
no
effort
or
pang
to
give
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
from
this
day
I
be
about
to
enter
a
well
frame
of
mind
,
to
prepare
myself
for
reunion
with
Frank
.
<EOS>
You
see
I
still
think
of
Frank
more
than
of
God
;
and
unless
it
be
count
that
in
thus
love
the
creature
so
much
,
so
long
,
and
so
exclusively
,
I
have
not
at
least
blaspheme
the
Creator
,
small
be
my
chance
of
salvation
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
,
Lucy
,
of
these
thing
?
<EOS>
be
my
chaplain
,
and
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
question
I
could
not
answer
:
<EOS>
I
have
no
word
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
she
think
I
_
have
_
answer
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
right
,
my
child
.
<EOS>
We
should
acknowledge
God
merciful
,
but
not
always
for
us
comprehensible
.
<EOS>
We
should
accept
our
own
lot
,
whatever
it
be
,
and
try
to
render
happy
that
of
other
.
<EOS>
Should
we
not
?
<EOS>
well
,
to

morrow
I
will
begin
by
try
to
make
you
happy
.
<EOS>
I
will
endeavour
to
do
something
for
you
,
Lucy
:
something
that
will
benefit
you
when
I
be
dead

<EOS>
My
head
ache
now
with
talk
too
much

still
I
be
happy

<EOS>
go
to
bed

clock
strike
two

late
you
sit
up

rather
how
late

keep
you
up

go
now

have
no

rest
well

<EOS>
She
compose
herself
as
if
to
slumber
.
<EOS>
I
,
too
,
retire
to
my
crib
in
a
closet
within
her
room
.
<EOS>
the
night
pass
in
quietness
;
quietly
her
doom
must
at
last
have
come
:
peacefully
and
painlessly
:
in
the
morning
she
be
find
without
life
,
nearly
cold
,
but
all
calm
and
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
Her
previous
excitement
of
spirit
and
change
of
mood
have
be
the
prelude
of
a
fit
;
one
stroke
suffice
to
sever
the
thread
of
an
existence
so
long
fret
by
affliction
.
    
<EOS>
turn
a
new
leaf
.
  
<EOS>
My
mistress
be
dead
,
and
I
once
more
alone
,
I
have
to
look
out
for
a
new
place
.
<EOS>
about
this
time
I
may
be
a
little
 
a
very
little
 
shake
in
nerve
.
<EOS>
I
grant
<EOS>
I
be
not
look
well
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
thin
,
haggard
,
and
hollow
-
eyed
;
like
a
sitter
-
up
at
night
,
like
an
overwrought
servant
,
or
a
placeless
person
in
debt
.
<EOS>
in
debt
,
however
,
I
be
not
;
nor
quite
poor
;
for
though
Miss
Marchmont
have
not
have
time
to
benefit
me
,
as
,
on
that
last
night
,
she
say
she
intend
,
yet
,
after
the
funeral
,
my
wage
be
duly
pay
by
her
second
cousin
,
the
heir
,
an
avaricious
-
looking
man
,
with
pinched
nose
and
narrow
temple
,
<EOS>
who
,
indeed
,
I
hear
long
afterwards
,
turn
out
a
thorough
miser
:
a
direct
contrast
to
his
generous
kinswoman
,
and
a
foil
to
her
memory
,
bless
to
this
day
by
the
poor
and
needy
.
<EOS>
the
possessor
,
then
,
of
fifteen
pound
;
of
health
,
though
wear
,
not
break
,
and
of
a
spirit
in
similar
condition
;
I
may
still
;
in
comparison
with
many
people
,
be
regard
as
occupy
an
enviable
position
.
<EOS>
an
embarrassing
one
it
be
,
however
,
at
the
same
time
;
as
I
feel
with
some
acuteness
on
a
certain
day
,
of
which
the
correspond
one
in
the
next
week
be
to
see
my
departure
from
my
present
abode
,
while
with
another
I
be
not
provide
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
dilemma
I
go
,
as
a
last
and
sole
resource
,
to
see
and
consult
an
old
servant
of
our
family
;
once
my
nurse
,
now
housekeeper
at
a
grand
mansion
not
far
from
Miss
Marchmont
's
.
<EOS>
I
spend
some
hour
with
her
;
she
comfort
,
but
know
not
how
to
advise
me
.
<EOS>
still
all
inward
darkness
,
I
leave
her
about
twilight
;
a
walk
of
two
mile
lie
before
me
;
it
be
a
clear
,
frosty
night
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
my
solitude
,
my
poverty
,
and
my
perplexity
,
my
heart
,
nourish
and
nerve
with
the
vigour
of
a
youth
that
have
not
yet
count
twenty
-
three
summer
,
beat
light
and
not
feebly
.
<EOS>
not
feebly
,
I
be
sure
,
or
I
should
have
tremble
in
that
lonely
walk
,
which
lie
through
still
field
,
and
pass
neither
village
nor
farmhouse
,
nor
cottage
:
<EOS>
I
should
have
quail
in
the
absence
of
moonlight
,
for
it
be
by
the
leading
of
star
<EOS>
only
I
trace
the
dim
path
;
I
should
have
quail
still
more
in
the
unwonted
presence
of
that
which
to
-
night
shone
in
the
north
,
a
moving
mystery
 
the
Aurora
Borealis
.
<EOS>
but
this
solemn
stranger
influence
me
otherwise
than
through
my
fear
.
<EOS>
some
new
power
it
seem
to
bring
.
<EOS>
I
draw
in
energy
with
the
keen
,
low
breeze
that
blow
on
its
path
.
<EOS>
a
bold
thought
be
send
to
my
mind
;
my
mind
be
make
strong
to
receive
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
leave
this
wilderness
,
"
it
be
say
to
me
,
"
and
go
out
hence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
?
"
be
the
query
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
very
far
to
look
;
gaze
from
this
country
parish
in
that
flat
,
rich
middle
of
England
 
I
mentally
see
within
reach
what
I
have
never
yet
beheld
with
my
bodily
eye
:
I
see
London
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
I
return
to
the
hall
,
and
ask
once
more
to
see
the
housekeeper
,
I
communicate
to
her
my
plan
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Barrett
be
a
grave
,
judicious
woman
,
though
she
know
little
more
of
the
world
than
myself
;
but
grave
and
judicious
as
she
be
,
she
do
not
charge
me
with
be
out
of
my
sense
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
have
a
staid
manner
of
my
own
which
ere
now
have
be
as
good
to
me
as
cloak
and
hood
of
hodden
grey
,
since
under
its
favour
I
have
be
enable
to
achieve
with
impunity
,
and
even
approbation
,
deed
that
,
if
attempt
with
an
excited
and
unsettled
air
,
would
in
some
mind
have
stamp
me
as
a
dreamer
and
zealot
.
  
<EOS>
the
housekeeper
be
slowly
propound
some
difficulty
,
while
she
prepare
orange
-
rind
for
marmalade
,
when
a
child
run
past
the
window
and
come
bound
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pretty
child
,
and
as
it
dance
,
laugh
,
up
to
me
 
for
we
be
not
stranger
(
nor
,
indeed
,
be
<EOS>
its
mother
 
a
young
married
daughter
of
the
house
 
a
stranger
)
 
<EOS>
I
take
it
on
my
knee
.
  
<EOS>
different
as
be
our
social
position
now
,
this
child
's
mother
<EOS>
and
I
have
be
schoolfellow
,
when
I
be
a
girl
of
ten
and
she
a
young
lady
of
sixteen
;
and
I
remember
her
,
good
-
look
,
but
dull
,
in
a
low
class
than
mine
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
admire
the
boy
's
handsome
dark
eye
,
when
the
mother
,
young
Mrs.
Leigh
,
enter
.
<EOS>
what
a
beautiful
and
kind
-
looking
woman
be
the
good
-
natured
and
comely
,
but
unintellectual
,
girl
become
!
<EOS>
Wifehood
and
maternity
have
change
her
thus
,
as
I
have
since
see
them
change
other
even
less
promising
than
she
.
<EOS>
Me
she
have
forget
.
<EOS>
I
be
change
too
,
though
not
,
I
fear
,
for
the
well
.
<EOS>
I
make
no
attempt
to
recall
myself
to
her
memory
;
why
should
I
?
<EOS>
She
come
for
her
son
to
accompany
her
in
a
walk
,
and
behind
her
follow
a
nurse
,
carry
an
infant
.
<EOS>
I
only
mention
the
incident
because
,
in
address
the
nurse
,
Mrs.
Leigh
speak
French
(
very
bad
French
,
by
the
way
,
and
with
an
incorrigibly
bad
accent
,
again
forcibly
remind
me
of
our
school
-
day
)
:
<EOS>
and
I
find
the
woman
be
a
foreigner
.
<EOS>
the
little
boy
chatter
volubly
in
French
too
.
<EOS>
when
the
whole
party
be
withdraw
,
Mrs.
Barrett
remark
that
her
young
lady
have
bring
that
foreign
nurse
home
with
her
two
year
ago
,
on
her
return
from
a
Continental
excursion
;
that
she
be
treat
almost
as
well
as
a
governess
,
and
have
nothing
to
do
but
walk
out
with
the
baby
and
chatter
French
with
Master
Charles
;
"
and
,
"
add
Mrs.
Barrett
,
"
she
say
there
be
many
Englishwomen
in
foreign
family
as
well
place
as
she
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
store
up
this
piece
of
casual
information
,
as
careful
housewife
store
seemingly
worthless
shred
and
fragment
for
which
their
prescient
mind
anticipate
a
possible
use
some
day
.
<EOS>
before
I
leave
my
old
friend
,
she
give
me
the
address
of
a
respectable
old
-
fashioned
inn
in
the
City
,
which
,
she
say
,
my
uncle
use
to
frequent
in
former
day
.

in
go
to
London
,
I
run
less
risk
and
evince
less
enterprise
than
the
reader
may
think
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
the
distance
be
only
fifty
mile
.
<EOS>
My
mean
would
suffice
both
to
take
me
there
,
to
keep
me
a
few
day
,
and
also
to
bring
me
back
if
I
find
no
inducement
to
stay
.
<EOS>
I
regard
it
as
a
brief
holiday
,
permit
for
once
to
work
-
weary
faculty
,
rather
than
as
an
adventure
of
life
and
death
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
like
take
all
you
do
at
a
moderate
estimate
:
it
keep
mind
and
body
tranquil
;
whereas
grandiloquent
notion
be
apt
to
hurry
both
into
fever
.
  
<EOS>
fifty
mile
be
then
a
day
's
journey
(
for
I
speak
of
a
time
go
by
:
my
hair
,
which
,
till
a
late
period
,
withstand
the
frost
of
time
,
lie
now
,
at
last
white
,
under
a
white
cap
,
like
snow
beneath
snow
)
.
<EOS>
about
nine
o'clock
of
a
wet
February
night
<EOS>
I
reach
London
.
  
<EOS>
My
reader
,
I
know
,
be
one
who
would
not
thank
me
for
an
elaborate
reproduction
of
poetic
first
impression
;
and
it
be
well
,
inasmuch
as
I
have
neither
time
nor
mood
to
cherish
such
;
arrive
as
I
do
late
,
on
a
dark
,
raw
,
and
rainy
evening
,
in
a
Babylon
and
a
wilderness
,
of
which
the
vastness
and
the
strangeness
try
to
the
utmost
any
power
of
clear
thought
and
steady
self
-
possession
with
which
,
in
the
absence
of
more
brilliant
faculty
,
Nature
may
have
gift
me
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
leave
the
coach
,
the
strange
speech
of
the
cabman
and
other
wait
round
,
seem
to
me
odd
as
a
foreign
tongue
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
before
hear
the
english
language
chop
up
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
manage
to
understand
and
to
be
understand
,
so
far
as
to
get
myself
and
trunk
safely
convey
to
the
old
inn
<EOS>
whereof
I
have
the
address
.
<EOS>
how
difficult
,
how
oppressive
,
how
puzzle
seem
my
flight
!
<EOS>
in
London
for
the
first
time
;
at
an
inn
for
the
first
time
;
tired
with
travel
;
confuse
with
darkness
;
palsy
with
cold
;
unfurnished
with
either
experience
or
advice
to
tell
me
how
to
act
,
and
yet
 
to
act
oblige
.
  
<EOS>
into
the
hand
of
common
sense
I
confide
the
matter
.
<EOS>
common
sense
,
however
,
be
as
chill
and
bewilder
as
all
my
other
faculty
,
and
it
be
only
under
the
spur
of
an
inexorable
necessity
that
she
spasmodically
execute
her
trust
.
<EOS>
thus
urge
,
she
pay
the
porter
:
consider
the
crisis
,
I
do
not
blame
her
too
much
that
she
be
hugely
cheat
;
she
ask
the
waiter
for
a
room
;
she
timorously
call
for
the
chambermaid
;
what
be
far
more
,
she
bear
,
without
be
wholly
overcome
,
a
highly
supercilious
style
of
demeanour
from
that
young
lady
,
when
she
appear
.
  
<EOS>
I
recollect
this
same
chambermaid
<EOS>
be
a
pattern
of
town
prettiness
and
smartness
.
<EOS>
so
trim
her
waist
,
her
cap
,
her
dress
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
they
have
all
be
manufacture
.
<EOS>
Her
speech
have
an
accent
which
in
its
mince
glibness
seem
to
rebuke
mine
as
by
authority
;
her
spruce
attire
flaunt
an
easy
scorn
to
my
plain
country
garb
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
it
can
not
be
help
,
"
I
think
,
"
and
then
the
scene
be
new
,
and
the
circumstance
;
I
shall
gain
good
.
"
  
<EOS>
maintain
a
very
quiet
manner
towards
this
arrogant
little
maid
,
and
subsequently
observe
the
same
towards
the
parsonic
-
looking
,
black
-
coated
,
white
-
neckclothed
waiter
,
I
get
civility
from
them
<EOS>
ere
long
.
<EOS>
I
believe
at
first
they
think
I
be
a
servant
;
but
in
a
little
while
they
change
their
mind
,
and
hover
in
a
doubtful
state
between
patronage
and
politeness
.
  
<EOS>
I
keep
up
well
till
I
have
partake
of
some
refreshment
,
warm
myself
by
a
fire
,
and
be
fairly
shut
into
my
own
room
;
but
,
as
I
sit
down
by
the
bed
and
rest
my
head
and
arm
on
the
pillow
,
a
terrible
oppression
overcome
me
.
<EOS>
all
at
once
my
position
rise
on
me
like
a
ghost
.
<EOS>
anomalous
,
desolate
,
almost
blank
of
hope
it
stand
.
<EOS>
what
be
I
do
here
alone
in
great
London
?
<EOS>
what
should
I
do
on
the
morrow
?
<EOS>
what
prospect
have
I
in
life
?
<EOS>
what
friend
have
I
on
,
earth
?
<EOS>
Whence
do
I
come
?
<EOS>
whither
should
I
go
?
<EOS>
what
should
I
do
?
  
<EOS>
I
wet
the
pillow
,
my
arm
,
and
my
hair
,
with
rush
tear
.
<EOS>
a
dark
interval
of
most
bitter
thought
follow
this
burst
;
but
I
do
not
regret
the
step
take
,
nor
wish
to
retract
it
a
strong
,
vague
persuasion
that
it
be
well
to
go
forward
than
backward
,
and
that
I
_
<EOS>
could
_
go
forward
 
that
a
way
,
however
narrow
and
difficult
,
would
in
time
open
 
predominate
over
other
feeling
<EOS>
:
its
influence
hush
them
so
far
,
that
at
last
I
become
sufficiently
tranquil
to
be
able
to
say
my
prayer
and
seek
my
couch
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
extinguish
my
candle
and
lain
down
,
when
a
deep
,
low
,
mighty
tone
swing
through
the
night
.
<EOS>
at
first
I
know
it
not
;
but
it
be
utter
twelve
time
,
and
at
the
twelfth
colossal
hum
and
tremble
knell
,
I
say
:
"
I
lie
in
the
shadow
of
St.
Paul
's
.
"
    
LONDON
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
be
the
first
of
March
,
and
when
I
awoke
,
rise
,
and
open
my
curtain
,
I
see
the
rise
sun
struggle
through
fog
.
<EOS>
above
my
head
,
above
the
house
-
top
,
co
-
elevate
almost
with
the
cloud
<EOS>
,
I
see
a
solemn
,
orbed
mass
,
dark
blue
and
dim
 
the
dome
.
<EOS>
while
I
look
,
my
inner
self
move
;
my
spirit
shake
its
always
-
fetter
wing
half
loose
;
I
have
a
sudden
feeling
as
if
I
,
who
never
yet
truly
live
,
be
at
last
about
to
taste
life
.
<EOS>
in
that
morning
my
soul
grow
as
fast
as
Jonah
's
gourd
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
well
to
come
,
"
I
say
,
proceed
to
dress
with
speed
and
care
.
<EOS>
"
I
like
the
spirit
of
this
great
London
which
I
feel
around
me
.
<EOS>
who
but
a
coward
would
pass
his
whole
life
in
hamlet
;
and
for
ever
abandon
his
faculty
to
the
eat
rust
of
obscurity
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
be
dress
,
I
go
down
;
not
travel
-
wear
and
exhausted
,
but
tidy
and
refreshed
.
<EOS>
when
the
waiter
come
in
with
my
breakfast
,
I
manage
to
accost
him
sedately
,
yet
cheerfully
;
we
have
ten
minute
'
discourse
,
in
the
course
of
which
we
become
usefully
known
to
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
grey
-
haired
,
elderly
man
;
and
,
it
seem
,
have
live
in
his
present
place
twenty
year
.
<EOS>
have
ascertain
this
,
I
be
sure
he
must
remember
my
two
uncle
,
Charles
and
Wilmot
,
who
,
fifteen
,
year
ago
,
be
frequent
visitor
here
.
<EOS>
I
mention
their
name
;
he
recall
them
perfectly
,
and
with
respect
.
<EOS>
have
intimate
my
connection
,
my
position
in
his
eye
be
henceforth
clear
,
and
on
a
right
footing
.
<EOS>
He
say
I
be
like
my
uncle
Charles
<EOS>
:
I
suppose
he
speak
truth
,
because
Mrs.
Barrett
be
accustomed
to
say
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
a
ready
and
obliging
courtesy
now
replace
his
former
uncomfortably
doubtful
manner
;
henceforth
I
need
no
longer
be
at
a
loss
for
a
civil
answer
to
a
sensible
question
.
  
<EOS>
the
street
on
which
my
little
sitting
-
room
window
look
be
narrow
,
perfectly
quiet
,
and
not
dirty
<EOS>
:
the
few
passenger
be
just
such
as
one
see
in
provincial
town
:
here
be
nothing
formidable
;
I
feel
sure
I
may
venture
out
alone
.
  
<EOS>
have
breakfast
,
out
I
go
.
<EOS>
elation
and
pleasure
be
in
my
heart
:
to
walk
alone
in
London
seem
of
itself
an
adventure
.
<EOS>
presently
I
find
myself
in
Paternoster
Row
 
classic
ground
this
.
<EOS>
I
enter
a
bookseller
's
shop
,
keep
by
one
Jones
<EOS>
:
I
buy
a
little
book
 
a
piece
of
extravagance
<EOS>
I
could
ill
afford
;
but
I
think
I
would
one
day
give
or
send
it
to
Mrs.
Barrett
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Jones
,
a
dry
-
in
man
of
business
,
stand
behind
his
desk
:
he
seem
one
of
the
great
,
and
I
one
of
the
happy
of
being
.
  
<EOS>
Prodigious
be
the
amount
of
life
I
live
that
morning
.
<EOS>
find
myself
before
St.
Paul
's
,
I
go
in
;
I
mount
to
the
dome
:
I
see
thence
London
,
with
its
river
,
and
its
bridge
,
and
its
church
;
I
see
antique
Westminster
,
and
the
green
Temple
Gardens
,
with
sun
upon
them
,
and
a
glad
,
blue
sky
,
of
early
spring
above
;
and
between
them
and
it
,
not
too
dense
,
a
cloud
of
haze
.
  
<EOS>
descending
,
I
go
wander
whither
chance
may
lead
,
in
a
still
ecstasy
of
freedom
and
enjoyment
;
and
I
get
 
I
know
not
how
 
I
get
into
the
heart
of
city
life
.
<EOS>
I
see
and
feel
London
at
last
:
I
get
into
the
Strand
;
I
go
up
Cornhill
;
I
mix
with
the
life
pass
along
;
I
dare
the
peril
of
crossing
.
<EOS>
to
do
this
,
and
to
do
it
utterly
alone
,
give
me
,
perhaps
an
irrational
,
but
a
real
pleasure
.
<EOS>
since
those
day
,
I
have
see
the
West
End
,
the
park
,
the
fine
square
;
but
I
love
the
city
far
better
.
<EOS>
the
city
seem
so
much
more
in
earnest
:
its
business
,
its
rush
,
its
roar
,
be
such
serious
thing
,
sight
,
and
sound
.
<EOS>
the
city
be
get
its
living
 
<EOS>
the
West
End
<EOS>
but
enjoy
its
pleasure
.
<EOS>
at
the
West
End
you
may
be
amuse
,
but
in
the
city
you
be
deeply
excited
.
  
<EOS>
Faint
,
at
last
,
and
hungry
(
it
be
year
since
I
have
feel
such
healthy
hunger
)
<EOS>
,
I
return
,
about
two
o'clock
,
to
my
dark
,
old
,
and
quiet
inn
.
<EOS>
I
dine
on
two
dish
 
a
plain
joint
and
vegetable
;
both
seem
excellent
:
how
much
well
than
the
small
,
dainty
mess
Miss
Marchmont
's
cook
use
to
send
up
to
my
kind
,
dead
mistress
and
me
,
and
to
the
discussion
of
which
we
could
not
bring
half
an
appetite
between
us
!
<EOS>
delightfully
tired
,
I
lie
down
,
on
three
chair
for
an
hour
<EOS>
(
the
room
do
not
boast
a
sofa
)
.
<EOS>
I
sleep
,
then
I
wake
and
think
for
two
hour
.
  
<EOS>
My
state
of
mind
,
and
all
accompany
circumstance
,
be
just
now
such
as
most
to
favour
the
adoption
of
a
new
,
resolute
,
and
daring
 
perhaps
desperate
 
line
of
action
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
lose
.
<EOS>
unutterable
loathing
of
a
desolate
existence
past
,
forbid
return
.
<EOS>
if
I
fail
in
what
I
now
design
to
undertake
,
who
,
save
myself
,
would
suffer
?
<EOS>
if
I
die
far
away
from
 
home
,
I
be
go
to
say
,
but
I
have
no
home
 
from
England
,
then
,
who
would
weep
?
  
<EOS>
I
may
suffer
;
I
be
inure
to
suffer
:
<EOS>
death
itself
have
not
,
I
think
,
those
terror
for
me
which
it
have
for
the
softly
rear
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
ere
this
<EOS>
,
look
on
the
thought
of
death
with
a
quiet
eye
.
<EOS>
prepare
,
then
,
for
any
consequence
,
I
form
a
project
.
  
<EOS>
that
same
evening
I
obtain
from
my
friend
,
the
waiter
,
information
respecting
,
the
sailing
of
vessel
for
a
certain
continental
port
,
Boue
-
Marine
.
<EOS>
no
time
,
I
find
,
be
to
be
lose
:
that
very
night
I
must
take
my
berth
.
<EOS>
I
may
,
indeed
,
have
wait
till
the
morning
before
go
on
board
,
but
would
not
run
the
risk
of
be
too
late
.
  
<EOS>
"
better
take
your
berth
at
once
,
madam
,
"
counsel
the
waiter
.
<EOS>
I
agree
with
him
,
and
have
discharge
my
bill
,
and
acknowledge
my
friend
's
service
at
a
rate
which
I
now
know
be
princely
,
and
which
in
his
eye
must
have
seem
absurd
 
and
indeed
,
while
pocket
the
cash
,
he
smile
a
faint
smile
which
intimate
his
opinion
of
the
donor
's
_
savoir
-
faire
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
he
proceed
to
call
a
coach
.
<EOS>
to
the
driver
he
also
recommend
me
,
give
at
the
same
time
an
injunction
about
take
me
,
I
think
,
to
the
wharf
,
and
not
leave
me
to
the
waterman
;
which
that
functionary
promise
to
observe
,
but
fail
in
keep
his
promise
:
on
the
contrary
,
he
offer
me
up
as
an
oblation
,
serve
me
as
a
dripping
roast
,
make
me
alight
in
the
midst
of
a
throng
of
waterman
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
an
uncomfortable
crisis
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
dark
night
.
<EOS>
the
coachman
instantly
drive
off
as
soon
as
he
have
get
his
fare
:
the
watermen
commence
a
struggle
for
me
and
my
trunk
.
<EOS>
Their
oath
I
hear
at
this
moment
:
they
shake
my
philosophy
more
than
do
the
night
,
or
the
isolation
,
or
the
strangeness
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
one
lay
hand
on
my
trunk
.
<EOS>
I
look
on
and
wait
quietly
;
but
<EOS>
when
another
lay
hand
on
me
,
I
speak
up
,
shake
off
his
touch
,
step
at
once
into
a
boat
,
desire
austerely
that
the
trunk
should
be
place
beside
me
 
"
just
there
,
"
 
which
be
instantly
do
;
for
the
owner
of
the
boat
I
have
choose
become
now
an
ally
:
I
be
row
off
.
  
<EOS>
Black
be
the
river
as
a
torrent
of
ink
;
light
glance
on
it
from
the

They

me
up

read
by

their
name
paint
in
great
white
letter
on
a
dark

it
seem
she
lie
further
down

<EOS>
down
the

we
glide
<EOS>
,
I
think
of
the
Styx
,
and
of
Charon
row
some
solitary
soul
to
the
Land
of
Shades
.
<EOS>
amidst
the
strange
scene

with
a
chilly
wind
blow
in

midnight
cloud
drop
rain
above

with

oath
still
torture
my

I
ask
myself
if
I
be
wretched

terrify

<EOS>
I
be
neither
.
<EOS>
often
in
my
life
have
I
be
far
more
so
under
comparatively
safe
circumstance
.
<EOS>
"
how
be
this
?
"
say
I.
"
Methinks
<EOS>
I
be
animate
and
alert
,
instead
of
be
depressed
and
apprehensive
?
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
tell
how
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
THE
VIVID

start
out
,
white
and
glaring
,
from
the
black
night
at
last

<EOS>
"
here

"
say
the
waterman
,
and
instantly
demand
six
shilling
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
ask
too
much
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
He
draw
off
from
the
vessel
and
swear
he
would
not
embark
me
till
I
pay
it
.
<EOS>
a
young
man
,
the
steward
as
I
find
afterwards
,
be
look
over
the
ship

side
;
he
grin
a
smile
in
anticipation
of
the
come
contest
;
to
disappoint
him
,
I
pay
the
money
.
<EOS>
three
time
that
afternoon
I
have
give
crown
where
I
should
have
give
shilling
;
but
I
console
myself
with
the
reflection
,
"
It
be
the
price
of
experience

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
cheat
you
!
"
<EOS>
say
the
steward
exultingly
when
I
get
on
board

<EOS>
I
answer
phlegmatically
that
"
I
know
it
,
"
and
go
below
.
  
<EOS>
a
stout
,
handsome
,
and
showy
woman
be
in
the
lady
'
cabin
.
<EOS>
I
ask
to
be
show
my
berth
;
she
look
hard
at
me
,
mutter
something
about
its
be
unusual
for
passenger
to
come
on
board
at
that
hour
,
and
seem
disposed
to
be
less
than
civil
.
<EOS>
what
a
face
she
have
 
so
comely
 
so
insolent
and
so
selfish
!
  
<EOS>
"
now
that
I
be
on
board
,
I
shall
certainly
stay
here
,
"
be
my
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
trouble
you
to
show
me
my
berth
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
comply
,
but
sullenly
.
<EOS>
I
take
off
my
bonnet
,
arrange
my
thing
,
and
lie
down
.
<EOS>
some
difficulty
have
be
pass
through
;
a
sort
of
victory
be
win
:
<EOS>
my
homeless
,
anchorless
,
unsupported
mind
have
again
leisure
for
a
brief
repose
.
<EOS>
till
the
"
Vivid
"
arrive
in
harbour
,
no
further
action
would
be
require
of
me
;
but
<EOS>
then
....
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
could
not
look
forward
.
<EOS>
harass
<EOS>
,
exhaust
,
I
lie
in
a
half
-
trance
.
  
<EOS>
the
stewardess
talk
all
night
;
not
to
me
but
to
the
young
steward
,
her
son
and
her
very
picture
.
<EOS>
He
pass
in
and
out
of
the
cabin
continually
<EOS>
:
they
dispute
,
they
quarrel
,
they
make
it
up
again
twenty
time
in
the
course
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
She
profess
to
be
write
a
letter
home
 
<EOS>
she
say
to
her
father
;
she
read
passage
of
it
aloud
,
heed
me
no
more
than
a
stock
 
<EOS>
perhaps
she
believe
me
asleep
.
<EOS>
several
of
these
passage
appear
to
comprise
family
secret
,
and
bore
special
reference
to
one
"
Charlotte
,
"
a
young
sister
who
,
from
the
bearing
of
the
epistle
,
seem
to
be
on
the
brink
of
perpetrate
a
romantic
and
imprudent
match
;
loud
be
the
protest
of
this
eld
lady
against
the
distasteful
union
.
<EOS>
the
dutiful
son
laugh
his
mother
's
correspondence
to
scorn
.
<EOS>
She
defend
it
,
and
rave
at
him
.
<EOS>
They
be
a
strange
pair
.
<EOS>
She
may
be
thirty
-
nine
or
forty
,
and
be
buxom
and
bloom
as
a
girl
of
twenty
.
<EOS>
hard
,
loud
,
vain
and
vulgar
,
her
mind
and
body
alike
seem
brazen
and
imperishable
.
<EOS>
I
should
think
,
from
her
childhood
,
she
must
have
live
in
public
station
;
and
in
her
youth
may
very
likely
have
be
a
barmaid
.
  
<EOS>
towards
morning
her
discourse
run
on
a
new
theme
:
"
the
Watsons
,
"
a
certain
expect
family
-
party
of
passenger
,
know
to
her
,
it
appear
,
and
by
her
much
esteem
on
account
of
the
handsome
profit
realize
in
their
fee
.
<EOS>
She
say
,
"
It
be
as
good
as
a
little
fortune
to
her
whenever
this
family
cross
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
dawn
all
be
astir
,
and
by
sunrise
the
passenger
come
on
board
.
<EOS>
Boisterous
be
the
welcome
give
by
the
stewardess
to
the
"
watson
,
"
and
<EOS>
great
be
the
bustle
make
in
their
honour
.
<EOS>
They
be
four
in
number
,
two
male
and
two
female
.
<EOS>
besides
them
,
there
be
but
one
other
passenger
 
a
young
lady
,
whom
a
gentlemanly
,
though
languid
-
look
man
escort
.
<EOS>
the
two
group
offer
a
marked
contrast
.
<EOS>
the
watson
be
doubtless
rich
people
,
for
they
have
the
confidence
of
conscious
wealth
in
their
bearing
;
the
woman
 
youthful
both
of
them
,
and
one
perfectly
handsome
,
as
far
as
physical
beauty
go
 
be
dress
richly
,
gaily
,
and
absurdly
out
of
character
for
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
Their
bonnet
with
bright
flower
,
their
velvet
cloak
and
silk
dress
,
seem
better
suited
for
park
or
promenade
than
for
a
damp
packet
deck
.
<EOS>
the
man
be
of
low
stature
,
plain
,
fat
,
and
vulgar
;
the
old
,
plain
,
greasy
,
broad
,
I
soon
find
be
the
husband
 
<EOS>
the
bridegroom
I
suppose
,
<EOS>
for
she
be
very
young
 
of
the
beautiful
girl
.
<EOS>
deep
be
my
amazement
at
this
discovery
;
and
deep
still
when
I
perceive
that
,
instead
of
be
desperately
wretche
in
such
a
union
,
she
be
gay
even
to
giddiness
.
"
<EOS>
Her
laughter
,
"
I
reflect
,
"
must
be
the
mere
frenzy
of
despair
.
"
<EOS>
and
even
while
this
thought
be
cross
my
mind
,
as
I
stand
lean
quiet
and
solitary
against
the
ship
's
side
,
she
come
trip
up
to
me
,
an
utter
stranger
,
with
a
camp
-
stool
in
her
hand
,
and
smile
a
smile
of
which
the
levity
puzzle
and
startle
me
,
though
it
show
a
perfect
set
of
perfect
tooth
,
she
offer
me
the
accommodation
of
this
piece
of
furniture
.
<EOS>
I
decline
it
of
course
,
with
all
the
courtesy
I
could
put
into
my
manner
;
she
dance
off
heedless
and
lightsome
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
be
good
-
natured
;
but
what
have
make
her
marry
that
individual
,
who
be
at
least
as
much
like
an
oil
-
barrel
as
a
man
?
  
<EOS>
the
other
lady
passenger
,
with
the
gentleman
-
companion
,
be
quite
a
girl
,
pretty
and
fair
:
<EOS>
her
simple
print
dress
,
untrimmed
straw
-
bonnet
and
large
shawl
,
gracefully
wear
,
form
a
costume
plain
to
quakerism
:
yet
,
for
her
,
become
enough
.
<EOS>
before
the
gentleman
quit
her
,
I
observe
him
throw
a
glance
of
scrutiny
over
all
the
passenger
,
as
if
to
ascertain
in
what
company
his
charge
would
be
leave
.
<EOS>
with
a
most
dissatisfied
air
do
his
eye
turn
from
the
lady
with
the
gay
flower
;
he
look
at
me
,
and
then
he
speak
to
his
daughter
,
niece
,
or
whatever
she
be
:
she
also
glance
in
my
direction
,
and
slightly
curl
her
short
,
pretty
lip
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
myself
,
or
it
may
be
my
homely
mourning
habit
,
that
elicit
this
mark
of
contempt
;
more
likely
,
both
.
<EOS>
a
bell
ring
;
her
father
<EOS>
(
I
afterwards
know
that
it
be
her
father
)
kiss
her
,
and
return
to
land
.
<EOS>
the
packet
sail
.
  
<EOS>
foreigner
say
that
it
be
only
english
girl
who
can
thus
be
trust
to
travel
alone
,
and
deep
be
their
wonder
at
the
daring
confidence
of
english
parent
and
guardian
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
"
jeunes
Meess
,
"
by
some
their
intrepidity
be
pronounce
masculine
and
"
inconvenant
,
"
other
regard
them
as
the
passive
victim
of
an
educational
and
theological
system
which
wantonly
dispense
with
proper
"
surveillance
.
<EOS>
"
whether
this
particular
young
lady
be
of
the
sort
that
can
the
most
safely
be
leave
unwatched
,
I
do
not
know
:
or
,
rather
do
not
_
<EOS>
then
_
know
;
but
it
soon
appear
that
the
dignity
of
solitude
be
not
to
her
taste
.
<EOS>
She
pace
the
deck
once
or
twice
backwards
and
forwards
;
she
look
with
a
little
sour
air
of
disdain
at
the
flaunting
silk
and
velvet
,
and
the
bear
which
thereon
dance
attendance
,
and
eventually
she
approach
me
and
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
fond
of
a
sea
-
voyage
?
"
be
her
question
.
  
<EOS>
I
explain
that
my
_
fondness
_
for
a
sea
-
voyage
have
yet
to
undergo
the
test
of
experience
;
I
have
never
make
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
how
charming
!
"
cry
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
quite
envy
you
<EOS>
the
novelty
:
first
impression
,
you
know
,
be
so
pleasant
.
<EOS>
now
I
have
make
so
many
,
I
quite
forget
the
first
:
I
be
quite
_
blasée
_
about
the
sea
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
laugh
at
me
?
<EOS>
"
she
inquire
,
with
a
frank
testiness
that
please
me
better
than
her
other
talk
.
  
<EOS>
"
because
you
be
so
young
to
be
_
blasée
_
about
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
seventeen

(
a
little
pique
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
hardly
look
sixteen

<EOS>
do
you
like
travel
alone
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
<EOS>
I
care
nothing
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
cross
the
Channel
ten
time
,
alone
;
but
then
I
take
care
never
to
be
long
alone
<EOS>
:
I
always
make
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
scarcely
make
many
friend
this
voyage
,
I
think
"
(
glance
at
the
Watson

group
,
who
be
now
laugh
and
make
a
great
deal
of
noise
on

<EOS>
"
not

say
she
:

I

beyond
,
at

,
the
port
of
Boue

<EOS>
She
stare
,
then
carelessly
run
on
:
  
"
I
be

nothing
 
nothing

I
assure
you

that
I

beautifully

french

to

but
I
can
not

write
them
very
well

<EOS>
do
you
know
they
want
me
to
translate
a
page
of
an
easy
german
book
into
English
the
other
day

I
could
not

so
mortify

my

who
pay
all
my

have
throw
away

then
,
in
matter
of
information
 
in
history
,
geography
,
arithmetic
,

so
on
,
I
be
quite
a
baby

I
write
English
so
badly
 
such
spelling

grammar
,
they
tell
me
.
<EOS>
into
the
bargain
I
have
quite
forget
my
religion
;
they
call
me
a
Protestant
,
you
know
,
but
really
I
be
not
sure
whether
I
be
one
or
not

:
I
do
not
well
know
the
difference
between
Romanism

Protestantism

<EOS>
however

I

not

bah
!
<EOS>
how
unpleasant
!
<EOS>
but
_
I
<EOS>
_
know
what
it
be
to
be
poor
:
they
be
poor
enough
at
home
 
papa
and
mamma
,
and
all
of
them
.
<EOS>
papa
be
call
Captain
Fanshawe
;
he
be
an
officer
on
half
-
pay
,
but
well
-
descended
,
and
some
of
our
connection
be
great
enough
;
but
my
uncle
and
godpapa
De
Bassompierre
,
who
live
in
France
,
be
the
only
one
that
help
us
:
he
educate
us

I
have
five

by

and
-
by
we
be
to

rather
elderly

I
suppose
,
with

papa

mamma
manage
that

<EOS>
My
sister
Augusta
be

now
to
a
man
much
older

look

<EOS>
Augusta
be
very
beautiful
 
not

dark
;
her

Mr.

,
have
the
yellow

he

then

Augusta

down

<EOS>
It
be
not
long
before
the
other
passenger
follow
her
:
throughout
the
afternoon
I
remain
on
deck
alone
.
<EOS>
when
I
recall
the
tranquil
,
and
even
happy
mood
in
which
I
pass
those
hour
,
and
remember
,
at
the
same
time
,
the
position
in
which
I
be
place
;
its
hazardous
 
some
would
have
say
its
hopeless
 
character
;
I
feel
that
,
as
    
Stone

not

nor

<EOS>
a

so

I
be
not
sick
till
long
after
we
pass
Margate
,
and
deep
be
the
pleasure
I
drink
in

divine
the

draw
from

<EOS>
in
my
reverie

methought
I
see
the

I

she
torment
me
with
an

in

Ginevra
Fanshawe
's
light

careless
temperament

fair

fragile

of
beauty
,
an
entire

<EOS>
the
man
who
take
such
a

ought
to
be
prepared
to
guarantee
her
an

<EOS>
indignant
at

with

I
curtly
request
her

the
rebuff
do
her
good

and
it
be
observable
that
she

large

<EOS>
It
be
strange
to
reflect
that
blackness

be
round
us

and
to
feel
the

plough
straight
on

Miss

declare

with

that

"

the

We

about
midnight
the

<EOS>
She
not

give

call

along

light
now
by

fitful
gleam
of
moonlight

he
bring
me
to
the
inn

<EOS>
I
offer
him
sixpence
,
which
he
refuse
to
take
;
suppose
it
not
enough
,
I
change
it
for
a
shilling

but
this
also
he
decline

speak
rather
sharply

a

come
forward

remind

in

I
give
him
a
sovereign
to
change

<EOS>
this
little
matter
settle
,
I
ask
for
a
bedroom
;
supper
I
could
not
take
:
I
be
still
sea
-
sick
and
unnerved
,
and
tremble
all
over
.
<EOS>
how
deeply
glad
I
be
when
the
door
of
a
very
small
chamber
at
length
close
on
me
and
my
exhaustion
.
<EOS>
again
I
may
rest
:
though
the
cloud
of
doubt
would
be
as
thick
to

morrow
as
ever

the
necessity
for
exertion
more
urgent

nearer

more

<EOS>
VILLETTE
.
  
<EOS>
I
awake
next
morning
with
courage
revive
and
spirit
refresh
:
physical
debility
no
longer
enervate
my
judgment
;
my
mind
feel
prompt
and
clear
.
  
<EOS>
just
as
I
finish
dress
,
a
tap
come
to
the
door
:
I
say
,
"
come
in
,
"
expect
the
chambermaid
,
whereas
a
rough
man
walk
in
and
say
,
    
<EOS>
"
Gif
me
your

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why

<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gif

"
say
he
impatiently
;
and
as
he
half
-
snatch
them
from
my
hand
,
he
add
,
"
all
right
!
<EOS>
haf
your
tronc
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
fortunately
it
do
turn
out
all
right
:
he
be
from
the
custom
-
house
.
<EOS>
where
to
go
to
get
some
breakfast
I
could
not
tell
;
but
I
proceed
,
not
without
hesitation
,
to
descend
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
observe
,
what
I
have
not
notice
in
my
extreme
weariness
last
night
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
this
inn
be
,
in
fact
,
a
large
hotel
;
and
as
I
slowly
descend
the
broad
staircase
,
halt
on
each
step
<EOS>
(
for
I
be
in
wonderfully
little
haste
to
get
down
)
,
I
gaze
at
the
high
ceiling
above
me
,
at
the
paint
wall
around
,
at
the
wide
window
which
fill
the
house
with
light
,
at
the
veined
marble
<EOS>
I
trod
(
for
the
step
be
all
of
marble
,
though
uncarpeted
and
not
very
clean
)
,
and
contrast
all
this
with
the
dimension
of
the
closet
assign
to
me
as
a
chamber
,
with
the
extreme
modesty
of
its
appointment
,
I
fall
into
a
philosophize
mood
.
  
<EOS>
much
I
marvel
at
the
sagacity
evince
by
waiter
and
chamber
-
maid
in
proportion
the
accommodation
to
the
guest
.
<EOS>
how
could
inn
-
servant
and
ship
-
stewardess
everywhere
tell
at
a
glance
that
I
,
for
instance
,
be
an
individual
of
no
social
significance
,
and
little
burden
by
cash
?
<EOS>
They
_
<EOS>
do
_
know
it
evidently
<EOS>
:
I
see
quite
well
that
they
all
,
in
a
moment
's
calculation
,
estimate
me
at
about
the
same
fractional
value
.
<EOS>
the
fact
seem
to
me
curious
and
pregnant
:
I
would
not
disguise
from
myself
what
it
indicate
,
yet
manage
to
keep
up
my
spirit
pretty
well
under
its
pressure
.
  
<EOS>
have
at
last
land
in
a
great
hall
,
full
of
skylight
glare
,
I
make
my
way
somehow
to
what
prove
to
be
the
coffee
-
room
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
deny
that
on
enter
this
room
I
tremble
somewhat
<EOS>
;
feel
uncertain
,
solitary
,
wretched
;
wish
to
Heaven
<EOS>
I
know
whether
I
be
do
right
or
wrong
;
feel
convinced
that
it
be
the
last
,
but
could
not
help
myself
.
<EOS>
act
in
the
spirit
and
with
the
calm
of
a
fatalist
,
I
sit
down
at
a
small
table
,
to
which
a
waiter
presently
bring
me
some
breakfast
;
and
I
partook
of
that
meal
in
a
frame
of
mind
not
greatly
calculated
to
favour
digestion
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
other
people
breakfast
at
other
table
in
the
room
;
I
should
have
feel
rather
more
happy
if
amongst
them
all
I
could
have
see
any
woman
;
however
,
there
be
not
one
 
all
present
be
man
.
<EOS>
but
nobody
seem
to
think
I
be
do
anything
strange
;
one
or
two
gentleman
glance
at
me
occasionally
,
but
none
stare
obtrusively
:
I
suppose
if
there
be
anything
eccentric
in
the
business
,
they
account
for
it
by
this
word
"
anglaise
!
"
  
<EOS>
breakfast
over
,
I
must
again
move
 
in
what
direction
?
<EOS>
"
go
to
Villette
,
"
say
an
inward
voice
;
prompt
doubtless
by
the
recollection
of
this
slight
sentence
utter
carelessly
and
at
random
by
Miss
Fanshawe
,
as
she
bid
me
good
-
by
:
"
I
wish
you
would
come
to
Madame
Beck
's
;
she
have
some
marmot
whom
you
may
look
after
;
she
want
an
english
gouvernante
,
or
be
want
one
two
month
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
who
Madame
Beck
be
,
where
she
live
<EOS>
,
I
know
not
;
I
have
ask
,
but
the
question
pass
unheard
:
Miss
Fanshawe
,
hurry
away
by
her
friend
,
leave
it
unanswered
.
<EOS>
I
presume
Villette
to
be
her
residence
 
to
Villette
I
would
go
.
<EOS>
the
distance
be
forty
mile
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
be
catch
at
straws
;
but
in
the
wide
and
welter
deep
where
I
find
myself
,
I
would
have
catch
at
cobwebs
.
<EOS>
have
inquire
about
the
mean
of
travel
to
Villette
,
and
secure
a
seat
in
the
diligence
,
I
depart
on
the
strength
of
this
outline
 
this
shadow
of
a
project
.
<EOS>
before
you
pronounce
on
the
rashness
of
the
proceeding
,
reader
,
look
back
to
the
point
whence
I
start
;
consider
the
desert
I
have
leave
,
note
how
little
I
perille
:
mine
be
the
game
where
the
player
can
not
lose
and
may
win
.
  
<EOS>
of
an
artistic
temperament
,
I
deny
that
I
be
;
yet
I
must
possess
something
of
the
artist
's
faculty
of
make
the
most
of
present
pleasure
:
that
be
to
say
,
when
it
be
of
the
kind
to
my
taste
.
<EOS>
I
enjoy
that
day
,
though
we
travel
slowly
,
though
it
be
cold
,
though
it
rain
.
<EOS>
somewhat
bare
,
flat
,
and
treeless
be
the
route
along
which
our
journey
lie
;
and
slimy
canal
creep
,
like
half
-
torpid
green
snake
,
beside
the
road
;
and
formal
pollard
willow
edge
level
field
,
till
like
kitchen
-
garden
bed
.
<EOS>
the
sky
,
too
,
be
monotonously
gray
;
the
atmosphere
be
stagnant
and
humid
;
yet
amidst
all
these
deaden
influence
,
my
fancy
bud
fresh
and
my
heart
bask
in
sunshine
.
<EOS>
these
feeling
,
however
,
be
well
keep
in
check
by
the
secret
but
ceaseless
consciousness
of
anxiety
lie
in
wait
on
enjoyment
,
like
a
tiger
crouch
in
a
jungle
.
<EOS>
the
breathing
of
that
beast
of
prey
be
in
my
ear
always
;
his
fierce
heart
pant
close
against
mine
;
he
never
stir
in
his
lair
<EOS>
but
I
feel
him
<EOS>
:
I
know
he
wait
only
for
sun
-
down
to
bind
ravenous
from
his
ambush
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
hope
we
may
reach
Villette
ere
night
set
in
,
and
that
thus
I
may
escape
the
deep
embarrassment
which
obscurity
seem
to
throw
round
a
first
arrival
at
an
unknown
bourne
;
but
,
what
with
our
slow
progress
and
long
stoppage
 
<EOS>
what
with
a
thick
fog
and
small
,
dense
rain
 
darkness
,
that
may
almost
be
feel
,
have
settle
on
the
city
by
the
time
we
gain
its
suburb
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
we
pass
through
a
gate
where
soldier
be
station
 
so
much
I
could
see
by
lamplight
;
then
,
have
leave
behind
us
the
miry
Chaussée
,
we
rattle
over
a
pavement
of
strangely
rough
and
flinty
surface
.
<EOS>
at
a
bureau
,
the
diligence
stop
,
and
the
passenger
alight
.
<EOS>
My
first
business
be
to
get
my
trunk
;
a
small
matter
enough
,
but
important
to
me
.
<EOS>
understand
that
it
be
good
not
to
be
importunate
or
over
-
eager
about
luggage
,
but
to
wait
and
watch
quietly
the
delivery
of
other
box
till
I
see
my
own
,
and
then
promptly
claim
and
secure
it
,
I
stand
apart
;
my
eye
fix
on
that
part
of
the
vehicle
in
which
I
have
see
my
little
portmanteau
safely
stow
,
and
upon
which
pile
of
additional
bag
and
box
be
now
heap
.
<EOS>
one
by
one
,
I
see
these
remove
,
lower
,
and
seize
on
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
sure
mine
ought
to
be
by
this
time
visible
:
it
be
not
.
<EOS>
I
have
tie
on
the
direction
-
card
with
a
piece
of
green
ribbon
,
that
I
may
know
it
at
a
glance
:
not
a
fringe
or
fragment
of
green
be
perceptible
.
<EOS>
every
package
be
remove
;
every
tin
-
case
and
brown
-
paper
parcel
;
the
oilcloth
cover
be
lift
;
I
see
with
distinct
vision
that
not
an
umbrella
,
cloak
,
cane
,
hat
-
box
or
band
-
box
remain
.
  
<EOS>
and
my
portmanteau
,
with
my
few
clothe
and
little
pocket
-
book
enclaspe
the
remnant
of
my
fifteen
pound
,
where
be
they
?
  
<EOS>
I
ask
this
question
now
,
but
I
could
not
ask
it
then
.
<EOS>
I
could
say
nothing
whatever
;
not
possess
a
phrase
of
_
speak
_
French
:
<EOS>
and
it
be
french
,
and
French
only
<EOS>
,
the
whole
world
seem
now
gabble
around
me
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
what
_
should
I
do
?
<EOS>
approach
the
conductor
,
I
just
lay
my
hand
on
his
arm
,
point
to
a
trunk
,
thence
to
the
diligence
-
roof
,
and
try
to
express
a
question
with
my
eye
.
<EOS>
He
misunderstand
me
,
seize
the
trunk
indicate
,
and
be
about
to
hoist
it
on
the
vehicle
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
that
alone
 
<EOS>
will
you
?
"
say
a
voice
in
good
English
;
then
,
in
correction
,
"
Qu'est
-
ce
que
vous
faîte
donc
?
<EOS>
Cette
malle
est
à
moi
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
I
have
hear
the
Fatherland
accent
;
they
rejoice
my
heart
;
I
turn
:
"
Sir
,
"
say
I
,
appeal
to
the
stranger
,
without
,
in
my
distress
,
notice
what
he
be
like
,
"
I
can
not
speak
French
.
<EOS>
May
I
entreat
you
to
ask
this
man
what
he
have
do
with
my
trunk
?
"
  
<EOS>
without
discriminate
,
for
the
moment
,
what
sort
of
face
it
be
to
which
my
eye
be
raise
and
on
which
they
be
fix
,
I
feel
in
its
expression
half
-
surprise
at
my
appeal
and
half
-
doubt
of
the
wisdom
of
interference
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
do
_
ask
him
;
I
would
do
as
much
for
you
,
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
he
smile
,
but
he
say
in
a
gentlemanly
tone
 
that
be
to
say
,
a
tone
not
hard
nor
terrifying
,
 
<EOS>
"
what
sort
of
trunk
be
yours
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
describe
it
,
include
in
my
description
the
green
ribbon
.
<EOS>
and
forthwith
he
take
the
conductor
under
hand
,
and
I
feel
,
through
all
the
storm
of
French
which
follow
,
that
he
rake
him
fore
and
aft
.
<EOS>
presently
he
return
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
fellow
aver
he
be
overloaded
,
and
confess
that
he
remove
your
trunk
after
you
see
it
put
on
,
and
have
leave
it
behind
at
Boue
-
Marine
with
other
parcel
;
he
have
promise
,
however
,
to
forward
it
to
-
morrow
;
<EOS>
the
day
after
,
therefore
,
you
will
find
it
safe
at
this
bureau
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
"
say
I
:
<EOS>
but
my
heart
sink
.
  
<EOS>
meantime
what
should
I
do
?
<EOS>
perhaps
this
english
gentleman
see
the
failure
of
courage
in
my
face
;
he
inquire
kindly
,
"
have
you
any
friend
in
this
city
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
no
,
and
I
do
not
know
where
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
pause
,
in
the
course
of
which
,
as
he
turn
more
fully
to
the
light
of
a
lamp
above
him
,
I
see
that
he
be
a
young
,
distinguished
,
and
handsome
man
;
he
may
be
a
lord
,
for
anything
I
know
:
nature
have
make
him
good
enough
for
a
prince
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
His
face
be
very
pleasant
;
he
look
high
but
not
arrogant
,
manly
but
not
overbearing
.
<EOS>
I
be
turn
away
,
in
the
deep
consciousness
of
all
absence
of
claim
to
look
for
further
help
from
such
a
one
as
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
all
your
money
in
your
trunk
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
,
stop
me
.
  
<EOS>
how
thankful
be
I
to
be
able
to
answer
with
truth
 
"
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
I
have
enough
in
my
purse
"
<EOS>
(
for
I
have
near
twenty
franc
)
"
to
keep
me
at
a
quiet
inn
till
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
;
but
I
be
quite
a
stranger
in
Villette
,
and
do
not
know
the
street
and
the
inn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
give
you
the
address
of
such
an
inn
as
you
want
,
"
say
he
;
"
and
it
be
not
far
off
:
with
my
direction
you
will
easily
find
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
tear
a
leaf
from
his
pocket
-
book
,
write
a
few
word
and
give
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
_
<EOS>
do
_
think
him
kind
;
and
as
to
distrust
him
,
or
his
advice
,
or
his
address
,
I
should
almost
as
soon
have
think
of
distrust
the
Bible
.
<EOS>
there
be
goodness
in
his
countenance
,
and
honour
in
his
bright
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
short
way
will
be
to
follow
the
Boulevard
and
cross
the
park
,
"
he
continue
;
"
but
it
be
too
late
and
too
dark
for
a
woman
to
go
through
the
park
alone
;
I
will
step
with
you
thus
far
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
move
on
,
and
I
follow
him
,
through
the
darkness
and
the
small
soaking
rain
.
<EOS>
the
Boulevard
be
all
desert
,
its
path
miry
,
the
water
drip
from
its
tree
;
the
park
be
black
as
midnight
.
<EOS>
in
the
double
gloom
of
tree
and
fog
,
I
could
not
see
my
guide
;
I
could
only
follow
his
tread
.
<EOS>
not
the
least
fear
have
I
<EOS>
:
I
believe
I
would
have
follow
that
frank
tread
,
through
continual
night
,
to
the
world
's
end
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
"
say
he
,
when
the
park
be
traverse
,
"
you
will
go
along
this
broad
street
till
you
come
to
step
;
two
lamp
will
show
you
where
they
be
:
these
step
you
will
descend
:
a
narrow
street
lie
below
;
follow
that
,
at
the
bottom
you
will
find
your
inn
.
<EOS>
They
speak
English
there
,
so
your
difficulty
be
now
pretty
well
over
.
<EOS>
good
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
-
night
,
sir
,
"
say
I
:
"
accept
my
sincere
thank
.
<EOS>
"
and
we
part
.
  
<EOS>
the
remembrance
of
his
countenance
,
which
I
be
sure
wear
a
light
not
unbenignant
to
the
friendless
 
the
sound
in
my
ear
of
his
voice
,
which
speak
a
nature
chivalric
to
the
needy
and
feeble
,
as
well
as
the
youthful
and
fair
 
be
a
sort
of
cordial
to
me
long
after
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
true
young
english
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
on
I
go
,
hurry
fast
through
a
magnificent
street
and
square
,
with
the
grand
house
round
,
and
amidst
them
the
huge
outline
of
more
than
one
overbearing
pile
;
which
may
be
palace
or
church
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
tell
.
<EOS>
just
as
I
pass
a
portico
,
two
mustachioed
man
come
suddenly
from
behind
the
pillar
;
they
be
smoke
cigar
:
their
dress
imply
pretension
to
the
rank
of
gentleman
,
but
,
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
they
be
very
plebeian
in
soul
.
<EOS>
They
speak
with
insolence
,
and
,
fast
as
I
walk
,
they
keep
pace
with
me
a
long
way
.
<EOS>
at
last
I
meet
a
sort
of
patrol
,
and
my
dreaded
hunter
be
turn
from
the
pursuit
;
but
they
have
drive
me
beyond
my
reckoning
:
when
I
could
collect
my
faculty
,
I
no
longer
know
where
I
be
;
the
staircase
I
must
long
since
have
pass
.
<EOS>
puzzle
,
out
of
breath
,
all
my
pulse
throb
in
inevitable
agitation
,
I
know
not
where
to
turn
.
<EOS>
It
be
terrible
to
think
of
again
encounter
those
bearded
,
sneer
simpleton
;
yet
the
ground
must
be
retrace
,
and
the
step
seek
out
.
  
<EOS>
I
come
at
last
to
an
old
and
worn
flight
,
and
,
take
it
for
grant
that
this
must
be
the
one
indicate
,
I
descend
them
.
<EOS>
the
street
into
which
they
lead
be
indeed
narrow
,
but
it
contain
no
inn
.
<EOS>
on
I
wander
.
<EOS>
in
a
very
quiet
and
comparatively
clean
and
well
-
pave
street
,
I
see
a
light
burn
over
the
door
of
a
rather
large
house
,
loftier
by
a
story
than
those
round
it
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
this
_
may
be
the
inn
at
last
.
<EOS>
I
hasten
on
:
my
knee
now
tremble
under
me
:
<EOS>
I
be
get
quite
exhausted
.
  
<EOS>
no
inn
be
this
.
<EOS>
a
brass
-
plate
embellish
the
great
porte

cochère
:
"
Pensionnat
de
Demoiselles
"
be
the
inscription
;
and
beneath
,
a
name
,
"
Madame
Beck

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
start
.
<EOS>
about
a
hundred
thought
volley
through
my
mind
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
yet
I
plan
nothing
,
and
consider
nothing
:
I
have
not
time
.
<EOS>
Providence
say
,
"
stop
here
;
this
be
_
your
_
inn
.
"
<EOS>
fate
take
me
in
her
strong
hand
;
master
my
will
;
direct
my
action
:
I
ring
the
door
-
bell
.
  
<EOS>
while
I
wait
,
I
would
not
reflect
.
<EOS>
I
fixedly
look
at
the
street
-
stone
,
where
the
door
-
lamp
shone
,
and
count
them
and
note
their
shape
,
and
the
glitter
of
wet
on
their
angle
.
<EOS>
I
ring
again
.
<EOS>
They
open
at
last
.
<EOS>
a
bonne
in
a
smart
cap
stand
before
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
see
Madame
Beck
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
  
<EOS>
I
believe
if
I
have
speak
French
she
would
not
have
admit
me
;
but
,
as
I
speak
English
,
she
conclude
I
be
a
foreign
teacher
come
on
business
connect
with
the
pensionnat
,
and
,
even
at
that
late
hour
,
she
let
me
in
,
without
a
word
of
reluctance
,
or
a
moment
of
hesitation
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
moment
I
sit
in
a
cold
,
glitter
salon
,
with
porcelain
stove
,
unlit
,
and
gild
ornament
,
and
polished
floor
.
<EOS>
a
pendule
on
the
mantel
-
piece
strike
nine
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
a
quarter
of
an
hour
pass
.
<EOS>
how
fast
beat
every
pulse
in
my
frame
!
<EOS>
how
I
turn
cold
and
hot
by
turn
!
<EOS>
I
sit
with
my
eye
fix
on
the
door
 
a
great
white
fold
-
door
,
with
gilt
moulding
:
I
watch
to
see
a
leaf
move
and
open
.
<EOS>
all
have
be
quiet
:
not
a
mouse
have
stir
;
the
white
door
be
closed
and
motionless
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
ayre
Engliss
?
"
say
a
voice
at
my
elbow
.
<EOS>
I
almost
bound
,
so
unexpected
be
the
sound
;
so
certain
have
I
be
of
solitude
.
  
<EOS>
no
ghost
stand
beside
me
,
nor
anything
of
spectral
aspect
;
merely
a
motherly
,
dumpy
little
woman
,
in
a
large
shawl
,
a
wrapping
-
gown
,
and
a
clean
,
trim
nightcap
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
I
be
English
,
and
immediately
,
without
further
prelude
,
we
fall
to
a
most
remarkable
conversation
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
(
for
Madame
Beck
it
be
 
<EOS>
she
have
enter
by
a
little
door
behind
me
,
and
,
be
shod
with
the
shoe
of
silence
<EOS>
,
I
have
hear
neither
her
entrance
nor
approach
)
 
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
have
exhaust
her
command
of
insular
speech
when
she
say
,
"
You
ayre
Engliss
,
"
and
she
now
proceed
to
work
away
volubly
in
her
own
tongue
.
<EOS>
I
answer
in
mine
.
<EOS>
She
partly
understand
me
,
but
as
I
do
not
at
all
understand
her
 
though
we
make
together
an
awful
clamour
(
anything
like
Madame
's
gift
of
utterance
I
have
not
hitherto
hear
or
imagine
)
 
<EOS>
we
achieve
little
progress
.
<EOS>
She
ring
,
ere
long
,
for
aid
;
which
arrive
in
the
shape
of
a
"
maîtresse
,
"
who
have
be
partly
educate
in
an
irish
convent
,
and
be
esteem
a
perfect
adept
in
the
english
language
.
<EOS>
a
bluff
little
personage
<EOS>
this
maîtresse
be
 
Labassecourienne
from
top
to
toe
:
and
how
she
do
slaughter
the
speech
of
Albion
!
<EOS>
however
,
I
tell
her
a
plain
tale
,
which
she
translate
.
<EOS>
I
tell
her
how
I
have
leave
my
own
country
,
intent
on
extend
my
knowledge
,
and
gain
my
bread
;
how
I
be
ready
to
turn
my
hand
to
any
useful
thing
,
provide
it
be
not
wrong
or
degrading
;
how
I
would
be
a
child's
-
nurse
,
or
a
lady's
-
maid
,
and
would
not
refuse
even
housework
adapt
to
my
strength
.
<EOS>
Madame
hear
this
;
and
,
question
her
countenance
,
I
almost
think
the
tale
win
her
ear
:
  
"
il
n'y
a
que
<EOS>
les
Anglaises
pour
ces
sortes
d'entreprises
,
"
say
she
:
"
<EOS>
sont
-
elle
donc
intrépide
ce
femme
là
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
ask
my
name
,
my
age
;
she
sit
and
look
at
me
 
not
pityingly
,
not
with
interest
:
never
a
gleam
of
sympathy
,
or
a
shade
of
compassion
,
cross
her
countenance
during
the
interview
.
<EOS>
I
feel
she
be
not
one
to
be
lead
an
inch
by
her
feeling
:
grave
and
considerate
,
she
gaze
,
consult
her
judgment
and
study
my
narrative
.
<EOS>
a
bell
ring
.
  
<EOS>
"
Voilà
pour
<EOS>
la
prière
du
soir
!
<EOS>
"
say
she
,
and
rise
.
<EOS>
through
her
interpreter
,
she
desire
me
to
depart
now
,
and
come
back
on
the
morrow
;
but
this
do
not
suit
me
:
I
could
not
bear
to
return
to
the
peril
of
darkness
and
the
street
.
<EOS>
with
energy
,
yet
with
a
collect
and
control
manner
,
I
say
,
address
herself
personally
,
and
not
the
maîtresse
:
"
be
assure
,
madame
,
that
by
instantly
secure
my
service
,
your
interest
will
be
serve
and
not
injure
<EOS>
:
you
will
find
me
one
who
will
wish
to
give
,
in
her
labour
,
a
full
equivalent
for
her
wage
;
and
if
you
hire
me
,
it
will
be
well
that
I
should
stay
here
this
night
:
have
no
acquaintance
in
Villette
,
and
not
possess
the
language
of
the
country
,
how
can
I
secure
a
lodging
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
true
,
"
say
she
;
"
but
at
least
you
can
give
a
reference
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
none

"
  
<EOS>
She
inquire
after
my
luggage
:
I
tell
her
when
it
would
arrive
.
<EOS>
She
muse
.
<EOS>
at
that
moment
a
man
's
step
be
hear
in
the
vestibule
,
hastily
proceed
to
the
outer
door

<EOS>
(
I
shall
go
on
with
this
part
of
my
tale
as
if
I

all
that
pass

it

scarce
intelligible

it

<EOS>

Madame

<EOS>
the
little
man
fix
on
me
his
spectacle
:
a
resolute
compression
of
the
lip
,
and
gathering
of
the
brow

seem
to
say
that
he

<EOS>
MADAME
BECK
.
  
<EOS>
be
deliver
into
the
charge
of
the
maîtresse
,
I
be
lead
through
a
long
narrow
passage
into
a
foreign
kitchen
,
very
clean
but
very
strange
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
contain
no
means
of
cooking
 
neither
fireplace
nor
oven
;
I
do
not
understand
that
the
great
black
furnace
which
fill
one
corner
,
be
an
efficient
substitute
for
these
.
<EOS>
surely
pride
be
not
already
begin
its
whisper
in
my
heart
;
yet
I
feel
a
sense
of
relief
when
,
instead
of
be
leave
in
the
kitchen
,
as
I
half
anticipate
,
I
be
lead
forward
to
a
small
inner
room
term
a
"
cabinet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
cook
in
a
jacket
,
a
short
petticoat
and
sabot
,
bring
my
supper
:
to
wit
 
some
meat
,
nature
unknown
,
serve
in
an
odd
and
acid
,
but
pleasant
sauce
;
some
chop
potato
,
make
savoury
with
,
I
know
not
<EOS>
what
:
vinegar
and
sugar
,
I
think
:
<EOS>
a
tartine
,
or
slice
of
bread
and
butter
,
and
a
bake
pear
.
<EOS>
be
hungry
,
I
eat
and
be
grateful
.
  
<EOS>
after
the
"
prière
du
soir
,
"
Madame
herself
come
to
have
another
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
She
desire
me
to
follow
her
up
-
stair
.
<EOS>
through
a
series
of
the
queerest
little
dormitory
 
which
,
I
hear
afterwards
,
have
once
be
nun
'
cell
:
for
the
premise
be
in
part
of
ancient
date
 
and
through
the
oratory
 
a
long
,
low
,
gloomy
room
,
where
a
crucifix
hung
,
pale
,
against
the
wall
,
and
two
taper
keep
dim
vigil
 
<EOS>
she
conduct
me
to
an
apartment
where
three
child
be
asleep
in
three
tiny
bed
.
<EOS>
a
heated
stove
make
the
air
of
this
room
oppressive
;
and
,
to
mend
matter
,
it
be
scent
with
an
odour
rather
strong
than
delicate
:
a
perfume
,
indeed
,
altogether
surprising
and
unexpected
under
the
circumstance
,
be
like
the
combination
of
smoke
with
some
spirituous
essence
 
<EOS>
a
smell
,
in
short
,
of
whisky
.
  
<EOS>
beside
a
table
,
on
which
flare
the
remnant
of
a
candle
guttering
to
waste
in
the
socket
,
a
coarse
woman
,
heterogeneously
clothe
in
a
broad
stripe
showy
silk
dress
,
and
a
stuff
apron
,
sit
in
a
chair
fast
asleep
.
<EOS>
to
complete
the
picture
,
and
leave
no
doubt
as
to
the
state
of
matter
,
a
bottle
and
an
empty
glass
stand
at
the
sleep
beauty
's
elbow
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
contemplate
this
remarkable
tableau
with
great
calm
;
she
neither
smile
nor
scowl
;
no
impress
of
anger
,
disgust
,
or
surprise
,
ruffle
the
equality
of
her
grave
aspect
;
she
do
not
even
wake
the
woman
!
<EOS>
serenely
point
to
a
fourth
bed
,
she
intimate
that
it
be
to
be
mine
;
then
,
have
extinguish
the
candle
and
substitute
for
it
a
night
-
lamp
,
she
glide
through
an
inner
door
,
which
she
leave
ajar
 
the
entrance
to
her
own
chamber
,
a
large
,
well
-
furnish
apartment
;
as
be
discernible
through
the
aperture
.
  
<EOS>
My
devotion
that
night
be
all
thanksgiving
.
<EOS>
strangely
have
I
be
lead
since
morning
 
<EOS>
unexpectedly
have
I
be
provide
for
.
<EOS>
scarcely
could
I
believe
that
not
forty
-
eight
hour
have
elapse
since
I
leave
London
,
under
no
other
guardianship
than
that
which
protect
the
passenger
-
bird
 
with
no
prospect
but
the
dubious
cloud
-
tracery
of
hope
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
a
light
sleeper
;
in
the
dead
of
night
I
suddenly
awake
.
<EOS>
all
be
hush
,
but
a
white
figure
stand
in
the
room
 
Madame
in
her
night
-
dress
.
<EOS>
move
without
perceptible
sound
,
she
visit
the
three
child
in
the
three
bed
;
she
approach
me
:
<EOS>
I
feign
sleep
,
and
she
study
me
long
.
<EOS>
a
small
pantomime
ensue
,
curious
enough
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
she
sit
a
quarter
of
an
hour
on
the
edge
of
my
bed
,
gaze
at
my
face
.
<EOS>
She
then
draw
nearer
,
bent
close
over
me
;
slightly
raise
my
cap
,
and
turn
back
the
border
so
as
to
expose
my
hair
;
she
look
at
my
hand
lie
on
the
bedclothe
.
<EOS>
this
done
,
she
turn
to
the
chair
where
my
clothe
lay
:
<EOS>
it
be
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
.
<EOS>
hear
her
touch
and
lift
them
,
I
open
my
eye
with
precaution
,
for
I
own
<EOS>
I
feel
curious
to
see
how
far
her
taste
for
research
would
lead
her
.
<EOS>
It
lead
her
a
good
way
:
every
article
do
she
inspect
.
<EOS>
I
divine
her
motive
for
this
proceeding
,
viz
.
<EOS>
the
wish
to
form
from
the
garment
a
judgment
respect
the
wearer
,
her
station
,
mean
,
neatness
,
&
<EOS>
c.
the
end
be
not
bad
,
but
the
mean
be
hardly
fair
or
justifiable
.
<EOS>
in
my
dress
be
a
pocket
;
she
fairly
turn
it
inside
out
:
she
count
the
money
in
my
purse
;
she
open
a
little
memorandum
-
book
,
coolly
peruse
its
content
,
and
take
from
between
the
leave
a
small
plaited
lock
of
Miss
Marchmont
's
grey
hair
.
<EOS>
to
a
bunch
of
three
key
,
be
those
of
my
trunk
,
desk
,
and
work
-
box
,
she
accord
special
attention
:
with
these
,
indeed
,
she
withdraw
a
moment
to
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
I
softly
rise
in
my
bed
and
follow
her
with
my
eye
:
these
key
,
reader
,
be
not
bring
back
till
they
have
leave
on
the
toilet
of
the
adjoining
room
the
impress
of
their
ward
in
wax
.
<EOS>
all
be
thus
do
decently
and
in
order
,
my
property
be
return
to
its
place
,
my
clothe
be
carefully
refolde
.
<EOS>
of
what
nature
be
the
conclusion
deduce
from
this
scrutiny
?
<EOS>
be
they
favourable
or
otherwise
?
<EOS>
vain
question
.
<EOS>
Madame
's
face
of
stone
(
for
of
stone
in
its
present
night
aspect
<EOS>
it
look
:
<EOS>
it
have
be
human
,
and
,
as
I
say
before
,
motherly
,
in
the
salon
)
betray
no
response
.
  
<EOS>
Her
duty
do
 
<EOS>
I
feel
that
in
her
eye
this
business
be
a
duty
 
<EOS>
she
rise
,
noiseless
as
a
shadow
<EOS>
:
she
move
towards
her
own
chamber
;
at
the
door
,
she
turn
,
fix
her
eye
on
the
heroine
of
the
bottle
,
who
still
sleep
and
loudly
snore
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Svini
(
I
presume
this
be
Mrs.
Svini
,
Anglicé
or
Hibernicé
,
Sweeny
)
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sweeny
's
doom

in
Madame
Beck

eye
 
an
immutable
purpose
that
eye
speak
:
<EOS>
Madame
's
visitation
for
shortcoming
may
be
slow
,
but
they
be
sure
.
<EOS>
all
this
be
very
un
-
English
:
truly
I
be
in
a
foreign
land
.
  
<EOS>
the
morrow
make
me
further
acquaint
with
Mrs.
Sweeny
.
<EOS>
It
seem
she
have
introduce
herself
to
her
present
employer
as
an
english
lady
in
reduce
circumstance
:
<EOS>
a
native
,
indeed
,
of
Middlesex
,
profess
to
speak
the
english
tongue
with
the
pure
metropolitan
accent
.
<EOS>
Madame
 
reliant
on
her
own
infallible
expedient
for

out
the
truth
in

have
a
singular
intrepidity

hire
service

hand
<EOS>
(
as
indeed
seem
abundantly
prove
in
my
own
case
)
.
<EOS>
She
receive
Mrs.
Sweeny
as
nursery
-
governess
to
her
three
child
.
<EOS>
I
need
hardly
explain
to
the
reader
that
this
lady
be
in
effect
a
native
of
Ireland
;
her
station
I
do
not
pretend
to
fix
:
she
boldly
declare
that
she
have
"
have
the
bringing
-
up
of
the
son
and
daughter
of
a
marquis
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
myself
,
she
may
possibly
have
be
a
hanger
-
on
,
nurse
,
fosterer
,
or
washerwoman
,
in
some
irish
family
:
she
speak
a
smothered
tongue
,
curiously
overlaid
with
mince
cockney
inflection
.
<EOS>
by
some
mean
or
other
she
have
acquire
,
and
now
hold
in
possession
,
a
wardrobe
of
rather
suspicious
splendour
 
gown
of
stiff
and
costly
silk
,
fit
her
indifferently
,
and
apparently
make
for
other
proportion
than
those
they
now
adorn
;
cap
with
real
lace
border
,
and
 
the
chief
item
in
the
inventory
,
the
spell
by
which
she
strike
a
certain
awe
through
the
household
,
quell
the
otherwise
scornfully
dispose
teacher
and
servant
,
and
,
so
long
as
her
broad
shoulder
_
wear
_
the
fold
of
that
majestic
drapery
,
even
influence
Madame
herself
 
_
a
real
indian
shawl
_
 
"
un
véritable
cachemire
,
"
as
Madame
Beck
say
,
with
unmixed
reverence
and
amaze
.
<EOS>
I
feel
quite
sure
that
without
this
"
cachemire
"
she
would
not
have
keep
her
footing
in
the
pensionnat
for
two
day
:
by
virtue
of
it
,
and
it
<EOS>
only
,
she
maintain
the
same
a
month
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
Mrs.
Sweeny
know
that
I
be
come
to
fill
her
shoe
,
then
it
be
that
she
declare
herself
 
then
do
she
rise
on
Madame
Beck
in
her
full
power
 
then
come
down
on
me
with
her
concentrated
weight
.
<EOS>
Madame
bear
this
revelation
and
visitation
<EOS>
so
well
,
<EOS>
so
stoically
,
that
I
for
very
shame
could
not
support
it
otherwise
than
with
composure
.
<EOS>
for
one
little
moment
Madame
Beck
absent
herself
from
the
room
;
ten
minute
after
,
an
agent
of
the
police
stand
in
the
midst
of
us
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sweeny
and
her
effect
be
remove
.
<EOS>
Madame
's
brow
have
not
be
ruffle
during
the
scene
 
her
lip
have
not
drop
one
sharply
-
accent
word
.
  
<EOS>
this
brisk
little
affair
of
the
dismissal
be
all
settle
before
breakfast
:
order
to
march
give
,
policeman
call
,
mutineer
expel
;
"
chambre
d'enfans
"
fumigated
and
cleanse
,
window
throw
open
,
and
every
trace
of
the
accomplished
Mrs.
Sweeny
 
even
to
the
fine
essence
and
spiritual
fragrance
which
give
token
so
subtle
and
so
fatal
of
the
head
and
front
of
her
offending
 
be
annihilate
from
the
Rue
Fossette
:
all
this
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
be
do
between
the
moment
of
Madame
Beck
's
issuing
like
Aurora
from
her
chamber
,
and
that
in
which
she
coolly
sit
down
to
pour
out
her
first
cup
of
coffee
.
  
<EOS>
about
noon
,
I
be
summon
to
dress
Madame
.
<EOS>
(
It
appear
my
place
be
to
be
a
hybrid
between
gouvernante
and
lady's
-
maid
.
)
<EOS>
till
noon
,
she
haunt
the
house
in
her
wrapping
-
gown
,
shawl
,
and
soundless
slipper
.
<EOS>
how
would
the
lady
-
chief
of
an
english
school
approve
this
custom
?
  
<EOS>
the
dressing
of
her
hair
puzzle
me
;
she
have
plenty
of
it
:
auburn
,
unmixed
with
grey
:
though
she
be
forty
year
old
.
<EOS>
see
my
embarrassment
,
she
say
,
"
You
have
not
be
a
femme
-
de
-
chambre
in
your
own
country
?
"
<EOS>
and
take
the
brush
from
my
hand
,
and
set
me
aside
,
not
ungently
or
disrespectfully
,
she
arrange
it
herself
.
<EOS>
in
perform
other
office
of
the
toilet
,
she
half
-
direct
,
half
-
aid
me
,
without
the
least
display
of
temper
or
impatience
.
<EOS>
N.B.
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
first
and
last
time
I
be
require
to
dress
her
.
<EOS>
henceforth
,
on
Rosine
,
the
portress
,
devolve
that
duty
.
  
<EOS>
when
attire
,
Madame
Beck
appear
a
personage
of
a
figure
rather
short
and
stout
,
yet
still
graceful
in
its
own
peculiar
way
;
that
is
,
with
the
grace
result
from
proportion
of
part
.
<EOS>
Her
complexion
be
fresh
and
sanguine
,
not
too
rubicund
;
her
eye
,
blue
and
serene
;
her
dark
silk
dress
fit
her
as
a
french
sempstress
alone
can
make
a
dress
fit
;
she
look
well
,
though
a
little
bourgeoise
;
as
bourgeoise
,
indeed
,
she
be
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
of
harmony
pervade
her
whole
person
;
and
yet
her
face
offer
contrast
,
too
<EOS>
:
its
feature
be
by
no
mean
such
as
be
usually
see
in
conjunction
with
a
complexion
of
such
blended
freshness
and
repose
:
<EOS>
their
outline
be
stern
:
her
forehead
be
high
but
narrow
;
it
express
capacity
and
some
benevolence
,
but
no
expanse
;
nor
do
her
peaceful
yet
watchful
eye
ever
know
the
fire
which
be
kindle
in
the
heart
or
the
softness
which
flow
thence
.
<EOS>
Her
mouth
be
hard
:
it
could
be
a
little
grim
;
her
lip
be
thin
.
<EOS>
for
sensibility
and
genius
,
with
all
their
tenderness
and
temerity
,
I
feel
somehow
that
Madame
would
be
the
right
sort
of
Minos
in
petticoat
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
long
run
,
I
find
she
be
something
else
in
petticoat
too
.
<EOS>
Her
name
be
Modeste
Maria
Beck
,
née
Kint
:
it
ought
to
have
be
Ignacia
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
charitable
woman
,
and
do
a
great
deal
of
good
.
<EOS>
there
never
be
a
mistress
whose
rule
be
milder
.
<EOS>
I
be
tell
that
she
never
once
remonstrate
with
the
intolerable
Mrs.
Sweeny
,
despite
her
tipsiness
,
disorder
,
and
general
neglect
;
yet
Mrs.
Sweeny
have
to
go
the
moment
her
departure
become
convenient
.
<EOS>
I
be
tell
,
too
,
that
neither
master
nor
teacher
be
find
fault
with
in
that
establishment
;
yet
both
master
and
teacher
be
often
change
:
they
vanish
and
other
fill
their
place
,
none
could
well
explain
how
.
  
<EOS>
the
establishment
be
both
a
pensionnat
and
an
externat
:
<EOS>
the
externe
or
day
-
pupil
exceed
one
hundred
in
number
;
the
boarder
be
about
a
score
.
<EOS>
Madame
must
have
possess
high
administrative
power
:
she
rule
all
these
,
together
with
four
teacher
,
eight
master
,
six
servant
,
and
three
child
,
manage
at
the
same
time
to
perfection
the
pupil
'
parent
and
friend
;
and
that
without
apparent
effort
;
without
bustle
,
fatigue
,
fever
,
or
any
symptom
of
undue
,
excitement
:
occupy
she
always
be
 
busy
,
rarely
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
Madame
have
her
own
system
for
manage
and
regulate
this
mass
of
machinery
;
and
a
very
pretty
system
it
be
:
<EOS>
the
reader
have
see
a
speciman
of
it
,
in
that
small
affair
of
turn
my
pocket
inside
out
,
and
read
my
private
memorandum
.
<EOS>
"
surveillance
,
"
"
espionage
,
"
 
<EOS>
these
be
her
watchword
.
  
<EOS>
still
,
Madame
know
what
honesty
be
,
and
like
it
 
that
is
,
when
it
do
not
obtrude
its
clumsy
scruple
in
the
way
of
her
will
and
interest
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
respect
for
"
Angleterre
;
"
and
as
to
"
les
Anglaises
,
"
she
would
have
the
woman
of
no
other
country
about
her
own
child
,
if
she
could
help
it
.
  
<EOS>
often
in
the
evening
,
after
she
have
be
plot
and
counter
-
plot
,
spy
and
receive
the
report
of
spy
all
day
,
she
would
come
up
to
my
room
 
a
trace
of
real
weariness
on
her
brow
 
<EOS>
and
she
would
sit
down
and
listen
while
the
child
say
their
little
prayer
to
me
in
English
:
<EOS>
the
Lord
's
Prayer
,
and
the
hymn
begin
"
Gentle
Jesus
,
"
these
little
Catholics
be
permit
to
repeat
at
my
knee
;
and
,
when
I
have
put
them
to
bed
,
she
would
talk
to
me
<EOS>
(
I
soon
gain
enough
French
to
be
able
to
understand
,
and
even
answer
her
)
about
England
and
Englishwomen
,
and
the
reason
for
what
she
be
pleased
to
term
their
superior
intelligence
,
and
more
real
and
reliable
probity
.
<EOS>
very
good
sense
she
often
show
;
very
sound
opinion
she
often
broach
:
she
seem
to
know
that
keep
girl
in
distrustful
restraint
,
in
blind
ignorance
,
and
under
a
surveillance
that
leave
them
no
moment
and
no
corner
for
retirement
,
be
not
the
good
way
to
make
them
grow
up
honest
and
modest
woman
;
but
she
aver
that
ruinous
consequence
would
ensue
if
any
other
method
be
try
with
continental
child
:
they
be
so
accustomed
to
restraint
,
that
relaxation
,
however
guard
,
would
be
misunderstood
and
fatally
presume
on
.
<EOS>
She
be
sick
,
she
would
declare
,
of
the
mean
she
have
to
use
,
but
use
them
she
must
;
and
after
discourse
,
often
with
dignity
and
delicacy
,
to
me
,
she
would
move
away
on
her
"
soulier
de
silence
,
"
and
glide
ghost
-
like
through
the
house
,
watch
and
spy
everywhere
,
peer
through
every
keyhole
,
listen
behind
every
door
.
  
<EOS>
after
all
,
Madame
's
system
be
not
bad
 
<EOS>
let
me
do
her
justice
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
well
than
all
her
arrangement
for
the
physical
well
-
being
of
her
scholar
.
<EOS>
no
mind
be
overtaske
:
the
lesson
be
well
distribute
and
make
incomparably
easy
to
the
learner
;
there
be
a
liberty
of
amusement
,
and
a
provision
for
exercise
which
keep
the
girl
healthy
;
the
food
be
abundant
and
good
:
<EOS>
neither
pale
nor
puny
face
be
anywhere
to
be
see
in
the
Rue
Fossette
.
<EOS>
She
never
grudge
a
holiday
;
she
allow
plenty
of
time
for
sleeping
,
dressing
,
washing
,
eat
;
her
method
in
all
these
matter
be
easy
,
liberal
,
salutary
,
and
rational
:
many
an
austere
english
school
-
mistress
would
do
vastly
well
to
imitate
her
 
<EOS>
and
I
believe
many
would
be
glad
to
do
so
,
if
exact
english
parent
would
let
them
.
  
<EOS>
as
Madame
Beck
rule
by
espionage
,
she
of
course
have
her
staff
of
spy
:
she
perfectly
know
the
quality
of
the
tool
she
use
,
and
while
she
would
not
scruple
to
handle
the
dirty
for
a
dirty
occasion
 
fling
this
sort
from
her
like
refuse
rind
,
after
the
orange
have
be
duly
squeeze
 
<EOS>
I
have
know
her
fastidious
in
seek
pure
metal
for
clean
use
;
and
when
once
a
bloodless
and
rustless
instrument
be
find
,
she
be
careful
of
the
prize
,
keep
it
in
silk
and
cotton
-
wool
.
<EOS>
yet
,
woe
be
to
that
man
or
woman
who
rely
on
her
one
inch
beyond
the
point
where
it
be
her
interest
to
be
trustworthy
:
<EOS>
interest
be
the
master
-
key
of
Madame
's
nature
 
<EOS>
the
mainspring
of
her
motive
 
the
alpha
and
omega
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
her
_
feeling
_
appeal
to
,
and
I
have
smile
in
half
-
pity
,
half
-
scorn
at
the
appellant
.
<EOS>
none
ever
gain
her
ear
through
that
channel
,
or
sway
her
purpose
by
that
mean
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
to
attempt
to
touch
her
heart
be
the
sure
way
to
rouse
her
antipathy
,
and
to
make
of
her
a
secret
foe
.
<EOS>
It
prove
to
her
that
she
have
no
heart
to
be
touch
:
it
remind
her
where
she
be
impotent
and
dead
.
<EOS>
never
be
the
distinction
between
charity
and
mercy
better
exemplify
than
in
her
.
<EOS>
while
devoid
of
sympathy
,
she
have
a
sufficiency
of
rational
benevolence
:
she
would
give
in
the
readiest
manner
to
people
she
have
never
see
 
rather
,
however
,
to
class
than
to
individual
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
pour
les
pauvre
,
"
she
open
her
purse
freely
 
against
_
the
poor
man
_
,
as
a
rule
,
she
keep
it
close
.
<EOS>
in
philanthropic
scheme
for
the
benefit
of
society
at
large
she
take
a
cheerful
part
;
no
private
sorrow
touch
her
:
no
force
or
mass
of
suffering
concentrate
in
one
heart
have
power
to
pierce
her
.
<EOS>
not
the
agony
in
Gethsemane
,
not
the
death
on
Calvary
,
could
have
wrung
from
her
eye
one
tear
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
again
,
Madame
be
a
very
great
and
a
very
capable
woman
.
<EOS>
that
school
offer
her
for
her
power
too
limit
a
sphere
;
she
ought
to
have
sway
a
nation
:
she
should
have
be
the
leader
of
a
turbulent
legislative
assembly
.
<EOS>
nobody
could
have
browbeat
her
,
none
irritate
her
nerve
,
exhaust
her
patience
,
or
over
-
reach
her
astuteness
.
<EOS>
in
her
own
single
person
,
she
could
have
comprise
the
duty
of
a
first
minister
and
a
superintendent
of
police
.
<EOS>
wise
,
firm
,
faithless
;
secret
,
crafty
,
passionless
;
watchful
and
inscrutable
;
acute
and
insensate
 
withal
perfectly
decorous
 
<EOS>
what
more
could
be
desire
?
  
<EOS>
the
sensible
reader
will
not
suppose
that
I
gain
all
the
knowledge
here
condense
for
his
benefit
in
one
month
,
or
in
one
half
-
year
.
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
what
I
see
at
first
be
the
thriving
outside
of
a
large
and
flourish
educational
establishment
.
<EOS>
here
be
a
great
house
,
full
of
healthy
,
lively
girl
,
all
well
-
dress
and
many
of
them
handsome
,
gain
knowledge
by
a
marvellously
easy
method
,
without
painful
exertion
or
useless
waste
of
spirit
;
not
,
perhaps
,
make
very
rapid
progress
in
anything
;
take
it
easy
,
but
still
always
employ
,
and
never
oppress
.
<EOS>
here
be
a
corps
of
teacher
and
master
,
more
stringently
task
,
as
all
the
real
head
-
labour
be
to
be
do
by
them
,
in
order
to
save
the
pupil
,
yet
have
their
duty
so
arrange
that
they
relieve
each
other
in
quick
succession
whenever
the
work
be
severe
:
here
,
in
short
,
be
a
foreign
school
;
of
which
the
life
,
movement
,
and
variety
make
it
a
complete
and
most
charming
contrast
to
many
english
institution
of
the
same
kind
.
  
<EOS>
behind
the
house
be
a
large
garden
,
and
,
in
summer
,
the
pupil
almost
live
out
of
door
amongst
the
rose
-
bush
and
the
fruit
-
tree
.
<EOS>
under
the
vast
and
vine
-
drape
berceau
,
Madame
would
take
her
seat
on
summer
afternoon
,
and
send
for
the
class
,
in
turn
,
to
sit
round
her
and
sew
and
read
.
<EOS>
meantime
,
master
come
and
go
,
deliver
short
and
lively
lecture
,
rather
than
lesson
,
and
the
pupil
make
note
of
their
instruction
,
or
do
_
not
_
make
them
 
just
as
inclination
prompt
;
secure
that
,
in
case
of
neglect

they
could
copy
the
note
of
their
companion

<EOS>
besides
the
regular
monthly
_
jour
de
sortie
_
,
the
catholic
fête
-
day
bring
a
succession
of
holiday
all
the
year
round
;
and
sometimes
on
a
bright
summer
morning
,
or
soft
summer
evening
;
the
boarder
be
take
out
for
a
long
walk
into
the
country
,
regale
with
_
gaufre

and
_
vin
blanc

or
new

and
_
pain
<EOS>
bis

(

and
coffee

<EOS>
all
this
seem
very
pleasant
,
and
Madame
appear
goodness
itself
;
and
the
teacher
not
so
bad
<EOS>
but
they
may
be
bad
;
and
the
pupil
,
perhaps
,
a
little
noisy
and
rough
,
but
type
of
health
and
glee
.
  
<EOS>
thus
do
the
view
appear
,
see
through
the
enchantment
of
distance
;
but
there
come
a
time
when
distance
be
to
melt
for
me
 
when
I
be
to
be
call
down
from
my
watch
-
tower
of
the
nursery
,
whence
<EOS>
I
have
hitherto
make
my
observation
,
and
be
to
be
compel
into
close
intercourse
with
this
little
world
of
the
Rue
Fossette
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
one
day
sit
up
-
stair
,
as
usual
,
hear
the
child
their
english
lesson
,
and
at
the
same
time
turn
a
silk
dress
for
Madame
,
when
she
come
saunter
into
the
room
with
that
absorb
air
and
brow
of
hard
think
she
sometimes
wear
,
and
which
make
her
look
so
little
genial
.
<EOS>
drop
into
a
seat
opposite
mine
,
she
remain
some
minute
silent
.
<EOS>
Désirée
,
the
eld
girl
,
be
read
to
me
some
little
essay
of
Mrs.
Barbauld
's
,
and
I
be
make
her
translate
currently
from
English
to
French
as
she
proceed
,
by
way
of
ascertaining
that
she
comprehend
what
she
read
<EOS>
:
Madame
listen
.
  
<EOS>
presently
,
without
preface
or
prelude
,
she
say
,
almost
in
the
tone
of
one
make
an
accusation
,
"
Meess
,
in
England
you
be
a
governess
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Madame
,
"
say
I
smile
,
<EOS>
"
you
be
mistaken
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
this
your
first
essay
at
teaching
 
this
attempt
with
my
child
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
assure
her
it
be
.
<EOS>
again
she
become
silent
;
but
look
up
,
as
I
take
a
pin
from
the
cushion
,
I
find
myself
an
object
of
study
:
she
hold
me
under
her
eye
;
she
seem
turn
me
round
in
her
thought
 
measure
my
fitness
for
a
purpose
,
weigh
my
value
in
a
plan
.
<EOS>
Madame
have
,
ere
this
<EOS>
,
scrutinize
all
I
have
,
and
I
believe
she
esteem
herself
cognizant
of
much
that
I
be
;
but
from
that
day
,
for
the
space
of
about
a
fortnight
,
she
try
me
by
new
test
.
<EOS>
She
listen
at
the
nursery
door
when
I
be
shut
in
with
the
child
;
she
follow
me
at
a
cautious
distance
when
I
walk
out
with
them
,
steal
within
ear
-
shot
whenever
the
tree
of
park
or
boulevard
afford
a
sufficient
screen
<EOS>
:
a
strict
preliminary
process
have
thus
be
observe
,
she
make
a
move
forward
.
  
<EOS>
one
morning
,
come
on
me
abruptly
,
and
with
the
semblance
of
hurry
,
she
say
she
find
herself
place
in
a
little
dilemma
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wilson
,
the
english
master
,
have
fail
to
come
at
his
hour
,
she
fear
he
be
ill
;
the
pupil
be
wait
in
classe
;
there
be
no
one
to
give
a
lesson
;
should
I
,
for
once
,
object
to
give
a
short
dictation
exercise
,
just
that
the
pupil
may
not
have
it
to
say
they
have
miss
their
english
lesson
?
  
<EOS>
"
in
classe
,
Madame
?
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
in
classe
:
in
the
second
division
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
there
be
sixty
pupil
,
"
say
I
;
for
I
know
the
number
,
and
with
my
usual
base
habit
of
cowardice
,
I
shrink
into
my
sloth
like
a
snail
into
its
shell
,
and
alleged
incapacity
and
impracticability
as
a
pretext
to
escape
action
.
<EOS>
if
leave
to
myself
,
I
should
infallibly
have
let
this
chance
slip
.
<EOS>
inadventurous
,
unstirre
by
impulse
of
practical
ambition
<EOS>
,
I
be
capable
of
sit
twenty
year
teach
infant
the
hornbook
,
turn
silk
dress
and
make
child
's
frock
.
<EOS>
not
that
true
contentment
dignify
this
infatuate
resignation
:
my
work
have
neither
charm
for
my
taste
,
nor
hold
on
my
interest
;
but
it
seem
to
me
a
great
thing
to
be
without
heavy
anxiety
,
and
relieve
from
intimate
trial
<EOS>
:
the
negation
of
severe
suffering
be
the
near
approach
to
happiness
I
expect
to
know
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
seem
to
hold
two
life
 
<EOS>
the
life
of
thought
,
and
that
of
reality
;
and
,
provide
the
former
be
nourish
with
a
sufficiency
of
the
strange
necromantic
joy
of
fancy
,
the
privilege
of
the
latter
may
remain
limited
to
daily
bread
,
hourly
work
,
and
a
roof
of
shelter
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
"
say
Madame
,
as
I
stoop
more
busily
than
ever
over
the
cutting
-
out
of
a
child

pinafore
,
"
leave
that

<EOS>

Fifine

Madame

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
fifine
must
want
it

then
,
for
I
want
_
you
_

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
as
Madame
Beck
do
really
want
and
be
resolve
to
have
me
 
as
she
have
long
be
dissatisfy
with
the
english
master
,
with
his
shortcoming
in
punctuality
,
and
his
careless
method
of
tuition
 
as
,
too
<EOS>
,
_
she
_
do
not
lack
resolution
and
practical
activity
,
whether
_
<EOS>
I
_
lack
them
or
not
 
<EOS>
she
,
without
more
ado
,
make
me
relinquish
thimble
and
needle
;
my
hand
be
take
into
her
,
and
I
be
conduct
down
-
stair
.
<EOS>
when
we
reach
the
carré
,
a
large
square
hall
between
the
dwelling
-
house
and
the
pensionnat
,
she
pause
,
drop
my
hand
,
face
,
and
scrutinize
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
flush
,
and
tremulous
from
head
to
foot
:
tell
it
not
in
Gath
,
I
believe
I
be
cry
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
the
difficulty
before
me
be
far
from
be
wholly
imaginary
;
some
of
them
be
real
enough
;
and
not
the
least
substantial
lie
in
my
want
of
mastery
over
the
medium
through
which
I
should
be
oblige
to
teach
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
indeed
,
study
French
closely
since
my
arrival
in
Villette
;
learn
its
practice
by
day
,
and
its
theory
in
every
leisure
moment
at
night
,
to
as
late
an
hour
as
the
rule
of
the
house
would
allow
candle
-
light
;
but
I
be
far
from
yet
be
able
to
trust
my
power
of
correct
oral
expression
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dîtes
donc
,
"
say
Madame
sternly
,
"
vous
sentez
vous
réellement
trop
faible
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
may
have
say
"
yes
,
"
and
go
back
to
nursery
obscurity
,
and
there
,
perhaps
,
moulder
for
the
rest
of
my
life
;
but
look
up
at
Madame
,
I
see
in
her
countenance
a
something
that
make
me
think
twice
ere
<EOS>
I
decide
.
<EOS>
at
that
instant
she
do
not
wear
a
woman
's
aspect
,
but
rather
a
man
's
.
<EOS>
power
of
a
particular
kind
strongly
limn
itself
in
all
her
trait
,
and
that
power
be
not
my
kind
of
power
:
<EOS>
neither
sympathy
,
nor
congeniality
,
nor
submission
,
be
the
emotion
it
awaken
.
<EOS>
I
stand
 
not
soothe
,
nor
win
,
nor
overwhelmed
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
a
challenge
of
strength
between
oppose
gift
be
give
,
and
I
suddenly
feel
all
the
dishonour
of
my
diffidence
 
all
the
pusillanimity
of
my
slackness
to
aspire
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
,
"
she
say
,
"
go
backward
or
forward
?
<EOS>
"
indicate
with
her
hand
,
first
,
the
small
door
of
communication
with
the
dwelling
-
house
,
and
then
the
great
double
portal
of
the
class
or
schoolroom
.
  
<EOS>
"
en
avant
,
"
I
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
pursue
she
,
cool
as
I
warm
,
and
continue
the
hard
look
,
from
very
antipathy
to
which
I
draw
strength
and
determination
,
"
can
you
face
the
class
,
or
be
you
over
-
excite
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
sneer
slightly
in
say
this
:
nervous
excitability
be
not
much
to
Madame
's
taste
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
no
more
excited
than
this
stone
,
"
I
say
,
tap
the
flag
with
my
toe
:
"
or
than
you
,
"
I
add
,
return
her
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
bon
!
<EOS>
but
let
me
tell
you
these
be
not
quiet
,
decorous
,
english
girl
you
be
go
to
encounter

<EOS>
Ce

des
Labassecouriennes
,
ronde
,
franche
,
brusque
,
et
tant
soit
peu
rebelle

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
say
:
"
I
know
;
<EOS>
and
I
know
,
too
,
<EOS>
that
though
I
have
study
French
hard
since
I
come
here
,
yet
I
still
speak
it
with
far
too
much
hesitation
 
<EOS>
too
little
accuracy
to
be
able
to
command
their
respect
<EOS>
I
shall
make
blunder
that
will
lay
me
open
to
the
scorn
of
the
most
ignorant
.
<EOS>
still
I
mean
to
give
the
lesson
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
They
always
throw
over
timid
teacher
,
"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
too
,
Madame
;
I
have
hear
how
they
rebel
against
and
persecute
Miss
Turner
"
 
a
poor
friendless
english
teacher
,
whom
Madame
have
employ
,
and
lightly
discard
;
and
to
whose
piteous
history
I
be
no
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
"
c'
vrai

"
say
she
,
coolly
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Turner
have
no
more
command
over
them
than
a
servant
from
the
kitchen
would
have
have
.
<EOS>
She
be
weak
and
wavering
;
she
have
neither
tact
nor
intelligence
,
decision
nor
dignity
.
<EOS>
Miss
Turner
would
not
do
for
these
girl
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
make
no
reply
,
but
advanced
to
the
closed
schoolroom
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
expect
aid
from
me
,
or
from
any
one
,
"
say
Madame
.
<EOS>
"
that
would
at
once
set
you
down
as
incompetent
for
your
office
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
open
the
door
,
let
her
pass
with
courtesy
,
and
follow
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
three
schoolroom
,
all
large
.
<EOS>
that
dedicate
to
the
second
division
,
where
I
be
to
figure
,
be
considerably
the
large
,
and
accommodate
an
assemblage
more
numerous
,
more
turbulent
,
and
infinitely
more
unmanageable
than
the
other
two
.
<EOS>
in
after
day
,
when
I
know
the
ground
better
,
I
use
to
think
sometimes
(
if
such
a
comparison
may
be
permit
)
,
that
the
quiet
,
polished
,
tame
first
division
be
to
the
robust
,
riotous
,
demonstrative
second
division
,
what
the
English
House
of
Lords
be
to
the
House
of
Commons
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
glance
inform
me
that
many
of
the
pupil
be
more
than
girl
 
<EOS>
quite
young
woman
<EOS>
;
I
know
that
some
of
them
be
of
noble
family
(
as
nobility
go
in
Labassecour
)
,
and
I
be
well
convinced
that
not
one
amongst
them
be
ignorant
of
my
position
in
Madame
's
household
.
<EOS>
as
I
mount
the
estràde
(
a
low
platform
,
raise
a
step
above
the
flooring
)
,
where
stand
the
teacher
's
chair
and
desk
,
I
beheld
opposite
to
me
a
row
of
eye
and
brow
that
threaten
stormy
weather
 
<EOS>
eye
full
of
an
insolent
light
,
and
brow
hard
and
unblushing
as
marble
.
<EOS>
the
continental
"
female
"
be
quite
a
different
being
to
the
insular
"
female
"
of
the
same
age
and
class
<EOS>
:
I
never
see
such
eye
and
brow
in
England
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
introduce
me
in
one
cool
phrase
,
sail
from
the
room
,
and
leave
me
alone
in
my
glory
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
that
first
lesson
,
nor
all
the
under
-
current
of
life
and
character
it
open
up
to
me
.
<EOS>
then
first
do
I
begin
rightly
to
see
the
wide
difference
that
lie
between
the
novelist
's
and
poet
's
ideal
"
jeune
fille
"
and
the
say
"
jeune
fille
"
as
she
really
be
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
that
three
title
belle
in
the
first
row
have
sit
down
predetermine
that
a
_
bonne
d'enfants
_
should
not
give
them
lesson
in
English
.
<EOS>
They
know
they
have
succeed
in
expel
obnoxious
teacher
before
now
;
they
know
that
Madame
would
at
any
time
throw
overboard
a
professeur
or
maitresse
who
become
unpopular
with
the
school
 
that
she
never
assist
a
weak
official
to
retain
his
place
 
that
if
he
have
not
strength
to
fight
,
or
tact
to
win
his
way
,
down
he
go
:
look
at
"
Miss
Snowe
,
"
they
promise
themselves
an
easy
victory
.
  
<EOS>
Mesdemoiselles
Blanche
,
Virginie
,
and
Angélique
open
the
campaign
by
a
series
of
tittering
and
whispering
;
these
soon
swell
into
murmur
and
short
laugh
,
which
the
remoter
bench
catch
up
and
echo
more
loudly
.
<EOS>
this
grow
revolt
of
sixty
against
one
,
soon
become
oppressive
enough
;
my
command
of
French
be
so
limited
,
and
exercise
under
such
cruel
constraint
.
  
<EOS>
Could
<EOS>
I
but
have
speak
in
my
own
tongue
,
I
feel
as
if
I
may
have
gain
a
hearing
;
for
,
in
the
first
place
,
though
I
know
I
look
a
poor
creature
,
and
in
many
respect
actually
be
so
,
yet
<EOS>
nature
have
give
me
a
voice
that
could
make
itself
hear
,
if
lift
in
excitement
or
deepen
by
emotion
.
<EOS>
in
the
second
place
,
while
I
have
no
flow
,
only
a
hesitating
trickle
of
language
,
in
ordinary
circumstance
,
yet
 
under
stimulus
such
as
be
now
rife
through
the
mutinous
mass
 
I
could
,
in
English
,
have
roll
out
readily
phrase
stigmatize
their
proceeding
as
such
proceeding
deserve
to
be
stigmatize
;
and
then
with
some
sarcasm
,
flavour
with
contemptuous
bitterness
for
the
ringleader
,
and
relieve
with
easy
banter
for
the
weak
but
less
knavish
follower
<EOS>
,
it
seem
to
me
that
one
may
possibly
get
command
over
this
wild
herd
,
and
bring
them
into
training
,

<EOS>
all
I
could
now
do
be
to
walk
up
to
Blanche
 
Mademoiselle
de
Melcy
,
a
young
baronne
 
the
eld
,
tall
,
handsome
,
and
most
vicious
 
stand
before
her
desk
,
take
from
under
her
hand
her
exercise
-
book
,
remount
the
estrade
,
deliberately
read
the
composition
,
which
I
find
very
stupid
,
and
,
as
deliberately
,
and
in
the
face
of
the
whole
school
,
tear
the
blot
page
in
two
.
  
<EOS>
this
action
avail
to
draw
attention
and
check
noise
.
<EOS>
one
girl
alone
,
quite
in
the
background
,
persevere
in
the
riot
with
undiminished
energy
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
her
attentively
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
pale
face
,
hair
like
night
,
broad
strong
eyebrow
,
decide
feature
,
and
a
dark
,
mutinous
,
sinister
eye
<EOS>
:
I
note
that
she
sit
close
by
a
little
door
,
which
door
,
I
be
well
aware
,
open
into
a
small
closet
where
book
be
keep
.
<EOS>
She
be
stand
up
for
the
purpose
of
conduct
her
clamour
with
free
energy
.
<EOS>
I
measure
her
stature
and
calculate
her
strength
<EOS>
She
seem
both
tall
and
wiry
;
but
,
so
the
conflict
be
brief
and
the
attack
unexpected
,
I
think
I
may
manage
her
.
  
<EOS>
advance
up
the
room
,
look
as
cool
and
careless
as
I
possibly
could
,
in
short
,
_
ayant
l'air
de
rien
_
,
I
slightly
push
the
door
and
find
it
be
ajar
.
<EOS>
in
an
instant
,
and
with
sharpness
,
I
have
turn
on
her
.
<EOS>
in
another
instant
she
occupy
the
closet
,
the
door
be
shut
,
and
the
key
in
my
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
It
so
happen
that
this
girl
,
dolore
by
name
,
and
a
Catalonian
by
race
,
be
the
sort
of
character
at
once
dread
and
hate
by
all
her
associate
<EOS>
;
the
act
of
summary
justice
above
note
prove
popular
:
there
be
not
one
present
but
,
in
her
heart
,
like
to
see
it
do
.
<EOS>
They
be
still
for
a
moment
;
then
a
smile
 
not
a
laugh
 
pass
from
desk
to
desk
:
then
 
when
I
have
gravely
and
tranquilly
return
to
the
estrade
,
courteously
request
silence
,
and
commence
a
dictation
as
if
nothing
at
all
have
happen
 
the
pen
travel
peacefully
over
the
page
,
and
the
remainder
of
the
lesson
pass
in
order
and
industry
.

I

not

the
stagnant
prey

my

Villette

and
in
this
school
be
girl
of
almost
every
european
nation
,
and
likewise
of
very
varied
rank
in
life
.
<EOS>
equality
be
much
practise
in
Labassecour
;
though
not
republican
in
form
,
it
be
nearly
so
in
substance
,
and
at
the
desk
of
Madame
Beck
's
establishment
the
young
countess
and
the
young
bourgeoise
sit
side
by
side
.
<EOS>
nor
could
you
always
by
outward
indication
decide
which
be
noble
and
which
plebeian
;
except
that
,
indeed
,
the
latter
have
often
frank
and
more
courteous
manner
,
while
the
former
bore
away
the
bell
for
a
delicately
-
balance
combination
of
insolence
and
deceit
.
<EOS>
in
the
former
there
be
often
quick
french
blood
mix
with
the
marsh
-
phlegm
:
<EOS>
I
regret
to
say
that
the
effect
of
this
vivacious
fluid
chiefly
appear
in
the
oilier
glibness
with
which
flattery
and
fiction
run
from
the
tongue
,
and
in
a
manner
light
and
lively
,
but
quite
heartless
and
insincere
.
  
<EOS>
to
do
all
party
justice
,
the
honest
aboriginal
Labassecouriennes
have
an
hypocrisy
of
their
own
,
too
;
but
it
be
of
a
coarse
order
,
such
as
could
deceive
few
.
<EOS>
whenever
a
lie
be
necessary
for
their
occasion
,
they
bring
it
out
with
a
careless
ease
and
breadth
altogether
untrouble
by
the
rebuke
of
conscience
.
<EOS>
not
a
soul
in
Madame
Beck
's
house
,
from
the
scullion
to
the
directress
herself
,
but
be
above
be
ashamed
of
a
lie
<EOS>
;
they
think
nothing
of
it
:
to
invent
may
not
be
precisely
a
virtue
,
but
it
be
the
most
venial
of
fault

an

of
every

monthly
confession

the
priest
hear
unshocked
,
and
absolve
unreluctant

<EOS>
if
they
have
miss
go
to
mass
,
or
read
a
chapter
of
a
novel

that
be
another

these

crime
whereof
rebuke

penance

the
unfailing

<EOS>
while
yet
but
half
-
conscious
of
this
state
of
thing
,
and
unlearn
in
its
result
,
I
get
on
in
my
new
sphere
very
well
.
<EOS>
after
the
first
few
difficult
lesson

give
amidst
peril
and
on
the
edge
of
a
moral
volcano
that
rumble
under
my

send
spark
and
hot
fume
into
my
eye

the
eruptive
spirit
seem
to
subside
,
as
far
as
I
be
concerned

<EOS>
My
mind
be
a
good
deal
bent
on
success
:
I
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
be
baffle
by
mere
undisciplined
disaffection
and
wanton
indocility
,
in
this
first
attempt
to
get
on
in
life
.
<EOS>
many
hour
of
the
night
I
use
to
lie
awake
,
think
what
plan
I
have
best
adopt
to
get
a
reliable
hold
on
these
mutineer
,
to
bring
this
stiff
-
necked
tribe
under
permanent
influence
.
<EOS>
in
,
the
first
place
,
I
see
plainly
that
aid
in
no
shape
be
to
be
expect
from
Madame
:
her
righteous
plan
be
to
maintain
an
unbroken
popularity
with
the
pupil
,
at
any
and
every
cost
of
justice
or
comfort
to
the
teacher
.
<EOS>
for
a
teacher
to
seek
her
alliance
in
any
crisis
of
insubordination
be
equivalent
to
secure
her
own
expulsion
.
<EOS>
in
intercourse
with
her
pupil
,
Madame
only
take
to
herself
what
be
pleasant
,
amiable
,
and
recommendatory
;
rigidly
require
of
her
lieutenant
sufficiency
for
every
annoying
crisis
,
where
to
act
with
adequate
promptitude
be
to
be
unpopular
.
<EOS>
thus
,
I
must
look
only
to
myself
.
  
<EOS>
Imprimis
 
<EOS>
it
be
clear
as
the
day
that
this
swinish
multitude
be
not
to
be
drive
by
force
.
<EOS>
They
be
to
be
humour
,
bear
with
very
patiently
:
a
courteous
though
sedate
manner
impress
them
;
a
very
rare
flash
of
raillery
do
good
.
<EOS>
severe
or
continuous
mental
application
they
could
not
,
or
would
not
,
bear
:
heavy
demand
on
the
memory
,
the
reason
,
the
attention
<EOS>
,
they
reject
point
-
blank
.
<EOS>
where
an
english
girl
of
not
more
than
average
capacity
and
docility
would
quietly
take
a
theme
and
bind
herself
to
the
task
of
comprehension
and
mastery
,
a
Labassecourienne
would
laugh
in
your
face
,
and
throw
it
back
to
you
with
the
phrase
,
 
"

que

je
n'en

"
  
<EOS>
a
teacher
who
understand
her
business
would
take
it
back
at
once
,
without
hesitation
,
contest
,
or
expostulation
 
proceed
with
even
exaggerated
care
to
smoothe
every
difficulty
,
to
reduce
it
to
the
level
of
their
understanding
,
return
it
to
them
thus
modify
,
and
lie
on
the
lash
of
sarcasm
with
unsparing
hand
.
<EOS>
They
would
feel
the
ste
,
perhaps
wince
a
little
under
it
;
but
they
bear
no
malice
against
this
sort
of
attack
,
provide
the
sneer
be
not
_
sour
_
,
but
_
hearty
_
,
and
that
it
hold
well
up
to
them
,
in
a
clear
,
light
,
and
bold
type
,
so
that
she
who
run
may
read
,
their
incapacity
,
ignorance
,
and
sloth
.
<EOS>
They
would
riot
for
three
additional
line
to
a
lesson
;
but
I
never
know
them
rebel
against
a
wound
give
to
their
self
-
respect
:
the
little
they
have
of
that
quality
be
train
to
be
crush
,
and
it
rather
like
the
pressure
of
a
firm
heel
than
otherwise
.
  
<EOS>
by
degree
,
as
I
acquire
fluency
and
freedom
in
their
language
,
and
could
make
such
application
of
its
more
nervous
idiom
as
suited
their
case
,
the
eld
and
more
intelligent
girl
begin
rather
to
like
me
in
their
way
:
I
notice
that
whenever
a
pupil
have
be
rouse
to
feel
in
her
soul
the
stirring
of
worthy
emulation
,
or
the
quickening
of
honest
shame
,
from
that
date
she
be
win
.
<EOS>
if
I
could
but
once
make
their
(
usually
large
)
ear
burn
under
their
thick
glossy
hair
,
all
be
comparatively
well
.
<EOS>
by
-
and
-
by
bouquet
begin
to
be
lay
on
my
desk
in
the
morning
;
by
way
of
acknowledgment
for
this
little
foreign
attention
,
I
use
sometimes
to
walk
with
a
select
few
during
recreation
.
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
conversation
it
befel
once
or
twice
that
I
make
an
unpremeditated
attempt
to
rectify
some
of
their
singularly
distort
notion
of
principle
;
especially
I
express
my
idea
of
the
evil
and
baseness
of
a
lie
.
<EOS>
in
an
unguarded
moment
,
I
chance
to
say
that
,
of
the
two
error
;
I
consider
falsehood
bad
than
an
occasional
lapse
in
church
-
attendance
.
<EOS>
the
poor
girl
be
tutor
to
report
in
Catholic
ear
whatever
the
Protestant
teacher
say

an
edifying
consequence

<EOS>
something
 
an
unseen
,
an
indefinite
,
a
nameless
 
<EOS>
something
steal
between
myself
and
these
my
good
pupil
:
the
bouquet
continue
to
be
offer
,
but
conversation
thenceforth
become
impracticable
.
<EOS>
as
I
pace
the
alley
or
sit
in
the
berceau
,
a
girl
never
come
to
my
right
hand
but
a
teacher
,
as
if
by
magic

appear
at
my
left

<EOS>
also

wonderful
to
relate
,
Madame

shoe
of
silence
bring
her
continually
to
my
back
,
as
quick
,
as
noiseless
and
unexpected
,
as
some
wander
zephyr
.
  
<EOS>
the
opinion
of
my
catholic
acquaintance
concern
my
spiritual
prospect
be
somewhat
naïvely
express
to
me
on
one
occasion
.
<EOS>
a
pensionnaire
,
to
whom
I
have
render
some
little
service
,
exclaim
one
day
as
she
sit
beside
me
:
"
Mademoiselle
,
what
a
pity
you
be
a
Protestant
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
Isabelle
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
certainement
que

et
d'ailleurs

prêtre

"
  
<EOS>
Isabelle
be
an
odd
,
blunt
little
creature
.
<EOS>
She
add
,
_
sotto
voce
_
:
"
pour
assurer
votre
salut
là

haut
,
on
ferait
bien
de
vous
brûl
toute
vive

<EOS>
I
laugh
,
as
,
indeed
,
it
be
impossible
to
do
otherwise
.
     
<EOS>
have
the
reader
forget
Miss
Ginevra
Fanshawe
?
<EOS>
if
so
,
I
must
be
allow
to
re
-
introduce
that
young
lady
as
a
thriving
pupil
of
Madame
Beck
's
;
for
such
she
be
.
<EOS>
on
her
arrival
in
the
Rue
Fossette
,
two
or
three
day
after
my
sudden
settlement
there
,
she
encounter
me
with
very
little
surprise
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
have
good
blood
in
her
vein
,
for
never
be
any
duchess
more
perfectly
,
radically
,
unaffectedly
_
nonchalante
_
than
she
:
a
weak
,
transient
amaze
be
all
she
know
of
the
sensation
of
wonder
.
<EOS>
Most
of
her
other
faculty
seem
to
be
in
the
same
flimsy
condition
:
her
liking
and
disliking
,
her
love
and
hate
,
be
mere
cobweb
and
gossamer
;
but
she
have
one
thing
about
her
that
seem
strong
and
durable
enough
,
and
that
be
 
her
selfishness
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
not
proud
;
and
 
_
bonne
d'enfants
_
as
I
be
 
<EOS>
she
would
forthwith
have
make
of
me
a
sort
of
friend
and
confidant
.
<EOS>
She
tease
me
with
a
thousand
vapid
complaint
about
school
-
quarrel
and
household
economy
:
the
cookery
be
not
to
her
taste
;
the
people
about
her
,
teacher
and
pupil
,
she
hold
to
be
despicable
,
because
they
be
foreigner
.
<EOS>
I
bear
with
her
abuse
of
the
Friday
's
salt
fish
and
hard
egg
 
with
her
invective
against
the
soup
,
the
bread
,
the
coffee
 
with
some
patience
for
a
time
;
but
at
last
,
weary
by
iteration
,
I
turn
crusty
,
and
put
her
to
right
:
a
thing
I
ought
to
have
do
in
the
very
beginning
,
for
a
salutary
set
down
always
agree
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
much
longer
have
I
to
endure
her
demand
on
me
in
the
way
of
work
.
<EOS>
Her
wardrobe
,
so
far
as
concerned
article
of
external
wear
,
be
well
and
elegantly
supply
;
but
there
be
other
habiliment
not
so
carefully
provide
:
what
she
have
,
need
frequent
repair
.
<EOS>
She
hate
needle
-
drudgery
herself
,
and
she
would
bring
her
hose
,
&
c.
to
me
in
heap
,
to
be
mend
.
<EOS>
a
compliance
of
some
week
threaten
to
result
in
the
establishment
of
an
intolerable
bore
 
I
at
last
distinctly
tell
her
she
must
make
up
her
mind
to
mend
her
own
garment
.
<EOS>
She
cry
on
receive
this
information
,
and
accuse
me
of
have
cease
to
be
her
friend
;
but
I
hold
by
my
decision
,
and
let
the
hysteric
pass
as
they
could
.
  
<EOS>
notwithstanding
these
foible
,
and
various
other
needless
to
mention
 
but
by
no
means
of
a
refined
or
elevate
character
 
<EOS>
how
pretty
she
be

how
charming
she
look

she
come
down

sunny
Sunday
morning
,
well
-
dressed
and
well
-
humour
,
robe
in
pale
lilac
silk
,
and
with
her
fair
long
curl
repose
on
her
white
shoulder
.
<EOS>
Sunday
be
a
holiday
which
she
always
pass
with
friend
resident
in
town
;
and
amongst
these
friend
she
speedily
give
me
to
understand
be
one
who
would
fain
become
something
more
.
<EOS>
by
glimpse
and
hint
it
be
show
me
,
and
by
the
general
buoyancy
of
her
look
and
manner
it
be
ere
long
prove
,
that
ardent
admiration
 
perhaps
genuine
love
 
be
at
her
command
.
<EOS>
She
call
her
suitor
"
isidore
:
"
this
,
however
,
she
intimate
be
not
his
real
name
,
but
one
by
which
it
please
her
to
baptize
him
 
his
own
<EOS>
,
she
hint
,
not
be
"
very
pretty
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
once
,
when
she
have
be
brag
about
the
vehemence
of
"
Isidore
's
"
attachment
,
I
ask
if
she
love
him
in
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
comme
cela
,
"
say
she
:
"
he
be
handsome
,
and
he
love
me
to
distraction
,
so
that
I
be
well
amused
.
<EOS>
Ca
suffit
.
"
  
<EOS>
find
that
she
carry
the
thing
on
longer
than
,
from
her
very
fickle
taste
,
I
have
anticipate
,
I
one
day
take
it
upon
me
to
make
serious
inquiry
as
to
whether
the
gentleman
be
such
as
her
parent
,
and
especially
her
uncle
 
<EOS>
on
whom
,
it
appear
<EOS>
,
she
be
dependent
 
would
be
likely
to
approve
.
<EOS>
She
allow
that
this
be
very
doubtful
,
as
she
do
not
believe
"
Isidore
"
have
much
money
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
encourage
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
furieusement
sometimes
,
"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
without
be
certain
that
you
will
be
permit
to
marry
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
how
dowdyish
you
be
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
to
be
marry
.
<EOS>
I
be
too
young
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
if
he
love
you
as
much
as
you
say
,
and
yet
it
come
to
nothing
in
the
end
,
he
will
be
make
miserable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
he
will
break
his
heart
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
shock
and
,
disappointed
if
he
do
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
this
M.
Isidore
be
a
fool
?
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
,
about
me
;
but
he
be
wise
in
other
thing
,
à
ce
qu'on
dit
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
consider
him
extremely
clever
:
she
say
he
will
push
his
way
by
his
talent
;
all
I
know
be
,
that
he
do
little
more
than
sigh
in
my
presence
,
and
that
I
can
wind
him
round
my
little
finger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
wish
to
get
a
more
definite
idea
of
this
love
-
stricken
M.
Isidore
;
whose
position
seem
to
me
of
the
least
secure
,
I
request
her
to
favour
me
with
a
personal
description
;
but
she
could
not
describe
:
she
have
neither
word
nor
the
power
of
put
them
together
so
as
to
make
graphic
phrase
.
<EOS>
She
even
seem
not
properly
to
have
notice
him
:
nothing
of
his
look
,
of
the
change
in
his
countenance
,
have
touch
her
heart
or
dwelt
in
her
memory
 
that
he
be
"
beau
,
mais
plutôt
bel
homme
que
joli
garçon
,
"
be
all
she
could
assert
.
<EOS>
My
patience
would
often
have
fail
,
and
my
interest
flag
,
in
listen
to
her
,
but
for
one
thing
.
<EOS>
all
the
hint
she
drop
,
all
the
detail
she
give
,
go
unconsciously
to
prove
,
to
my
thinking
,
that
M.
Isidore
's
homage
be
offer
with
great
delicacy
and
respect
.
<EOS>
I
inform
her
very
plainly
that
I
believe
him
much
too
good
for
her
,
and
intimate
with
equal
plainness
my
impression
that
she
be
but
a
vain
coquette
.
<EOS>
She
laugh
,
shake
her
curl
from
her
eye
,
and
dance
away
as
if
I
have
pay
her
a
compliment
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Ginevra
's
school
-
study
be
little
well
than
nominal
;
there
be
but
three
thing
she
practise
in
earnest
,
viz
.
<EOS>
music
,
singing
,
and
dancing
;
also
embroider
the
fine
cambric
handkerchief
which
she
could
not
afford
to
buy
<EOS>
ready
work
:
<EOS>
such
mere
trifle
as
lesson
in
history
,
geography
,
grammar
,
and
arithmetic
<EOS>
,
she
leave
undone
,
or
get
other
to
do
for
her
.
<EOS>
very
much
of
her
time
be
spend
in
visit
.
<EOS>
Madame
,
aware
that
her
stay
at
school
be
now
limit
to
a
certain
period
,
which
would
not
be
extend
whether
she
make
progress
or
not
,
allow
her
great
licence
in
this
particular
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
 
her
_
chaperon
_
 
<EOS>
a
gay
,
fashionable
lady
,
invite
her
whenever
she
have
company
at
her
own
house
,
and
sometimes
take
her
to
evening
-
party
at
the
house
of
her
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Ginevra
perfectly
approve
this
mode
of
procedure
:
it
have
but
one
inconvenience
;
she
be
oblige
to
be
well
dressed
,
and
she
have
not
money
to
buy
variety
of
dress
.
<EOS>
all
her
thought
turn
on
this
difficulty
;
her
whole
soul
be
occupy
with
expedient
for
effect
its
solution
.
<EOS>
It
be
wonderful
to
witness
the
activity
of
her
otherwise
indolent
mind
on
this
point
,
and
to
see
the
much
-
dare
intrepidity
to
which
she
be
spur
by
a
sense
of
necessity
,
and
the
wish
to
shine
.
  
<EOS>
She
beg
boldly
of
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
 
boldly
,
I
say
:
not
with
an
air
of
reluctant
shame
,
but
in
this
strain
:
    
"
My
darling
Mrs.
C.
,
I
have
nothing
in
the
world
fit
to
wear
for
your
party
next
week
;
you
_
must
_
give
me
a
book
-
muslin
dress
,
and
then
a
_
ceinture
bleu
celeste
_
:
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
do
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
angel
!
<EOS>
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
"
darle
Mrs.
C.
"
yield
at
first
;
but
find
that
application
increase
as
they
be
comply
with
,
she
be
soon
oblige
,
like
all
Miss
Fanshawe
's
friend
,
to
oppose
resistance
to
encroachment
.
<EOS>
after
a
while
I
hear
no
more
of
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
's
present
;
but
still
,
visit
go
on
,
and
the
absolutely
necessary
dress
continue
to
be
supply
:
also
<EOS>
many
little
expensive
<EOS>
_
etcetera
<EOS>
_
 
glove
,
bouquet
,
even
trinket
.
<EOS>
these
thing
,
contrary
to
her
custom
,
and
even
nature
 
<EOS>
for
she
be
not
secretive
 
<EOS>
be
most
sedulously
keep
out
of
sight
for
a
time
;
but
one
evening
,
when
she
be
go
to
a
large
party
for
which
particular
care
and
elegance
of
costume
be
demand
,
she
could
not
resist
come
to
my
chamber
to
show
herself
in
all
her
splendour
.
  
<EOS>
beautiful
she
look
:
<EOS>
so
young
,
so
fresh
,
and
with
a
delicacy
of
skin
and
flexibility
of
shape
altogether
English
,
and
not
find
in
the
list
of
continental
female
charm
.
<EOS>
Her
dress
be
new
,
costly
,
and
perfect
.
<EOS>
I
see
at
a
glance
that
it
lack
none
of
those
finish
detail
which
cost
so
much
,
and
give
to
the
general
effect
such
an
air
of
tasteful
completeness
.
  
<EOS>
I
view
her
from
top
to
toe
.
<EOS>
She
turn
airily
round
that
I
may
survey
her
on
all
side
.
<EOS>
conscious
of
her
charm
,
she
be
in
her
good
humour
:
<EOS>
her
rather
small
blue
eye
sparkle
gleefully
.
<EOS>
She
be
go
to
bestow
on
me
a
kiss
,
in
her
school
-
girl
fashion
of
show
her
delight
<EOS>
but
I
say
,
"
steady
!
<EOS>
let
us
be
steady
,
and
know
what
we
be
about
,
and
find
out
the
meaning
of
our
magnificence
"
 
and
so
put
her
off
at
arm
's
length
,
to
undergo
cooler
inspection
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
be
her
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
?
"
say
I.
<EOS>
"
there
be
different
way
of
do
;
and
,
by
my
word
,
I
do
not
understand
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
how
do
I
look
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
look
well
dressed
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
think
the
praise
not
warm
enough
,
and
proceed
to
direct
attention
to
the
various
decorative
point
of
her
attire
.
<EOS>
"
look
at
this
_
parure
_
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
brooch
,
the
ear

ring
,
the
bracelet
:
no
one
in
the
school
have
such
a
set
 
not
Madame
herself

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I

them
all

<EOS>
(
Pause

<EOS>
"
do
M.

not

<EOS>
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
be
a
mean

stingy
creature
;
she
never

me
anything
now

<EOS>
"
  
I
do
not
choose
to
ask
any
further
question
,
but
turn
abruptly
away

<EOS>
"
now

old
crusty
 
old

(
these
be
her
familiar

<EOS>
for
an

she
seem

by

what

Mother
Wisdom

I

Ginevra

tell

you

never

still

flutter
into

I

the

very
pretty

if
you
have
buy
them
with
money

this

mystery

two

day

<EOS>
"
You

I
assure
you
nothing

all

rest
be
settle

<EOS>

there
,

I
think
,

lie
the
mystery

consider
that
they
be
not
give
you
by
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
,
and
that
your
own
mean
be
limit
to
a
few
shilling

of

I
know
you
to
be
excessively
careful

Ecoutez

she
go
on
,
draw
near

speak
in
her
most
confidential
and
coax
tone
;
for
my
"
sulkiness
"
be
inconvenient
to
her
:
she
like
me
to
be
in
a
talk

listen
mood
,
even
if
I
only
talk
to
chide
and
listen
to
rail

<EOS>
"
Ecoutez

chère

<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
all
how
and
about
it
;
and
you
will
then
see
,
not
only
how
right
the
whole
thing
be
,
but
how
cleverly
manage
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
I
_
must
_
go
out
.
<EOS>
Papa
himself
say
that
he
wish
me
to
see
something
of
the
world
;
he
particularly
remark
to
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
,
that
,
though
I
be
a
sweet
creature
enough
,
I
have
rather
a
bread
-
and
-
butter
-
eating
,
school
-
girl
air
;
of
which
it
be
his
special
desire
that
I
should
get
rid
,
by
an
introduction
to
society
here
,
before
I
make
my
regular
début
in
England
.
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
if
I
go
out
,
I
_
must
_
dress
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
be
turn
shabby
,
and
will
give
nothing
more
;
it
would
be
too
hard
upon
uncle

make
him
pay
for
_
<EOS>
all
_
<EOS>
the
thing
I
need
:
_
<EOS>
that
_
<EOS>
you
can
not
deny
 
_
that
_
agree
with
your
own
preachment

<EOS>
well
,
but
SOMEBODY
who
hear
me
(
quite
by
chance

I
assure
you
)
complain
to
Mrs.

of
my
distressed

You

have
see
what

look

how

<EOS>

that
will
do

Miss

<EOS>
I
suppose
I
be
to

that
M.

be
the
benefactor
:
that
it
be
from
him
you
have
accept
that
costly

that

supply
your
bouquet

your

You
express
yourself
so
disagreeably

she

one
hardly

how

what
I
mean
to

,
that
I

now

Ginevra

to
speak
the
plain
truth

I
do
not
very
well
understand
these

I
believe
you
be
do
very
wrong
 
seriously
wrong

<EOS>
perhaps
,
however
,
you
now
feel
certain
that
you
will
be

marry
M.

your

for

you

you

no

I
dance
with
a

the

I

I
often
wonder
why
I
feel
so
very
cold

Isidore

for
everybody
say
he
be
handsome

other

admire

,
somehow
,
he
bore
me
:
let
me
see
now
how
it
be

<EOS>
and
she
seem
to
make
an
effort
to
reflect
.
<EOS>
in
this
I
encourage
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes

"
I
say
,
"
try

get

to
me
it
seem
in
a
great
mess
 
chaotic
as
a

bag

"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
something
in
this
fashion
,
"
she
cry
out
ere
long
:
"
the
man
be
too
romantic
and
devoted
,
and
he
expect
something
more
of
me
than
I
find
it
convenient

be

<EOS>
He
think
I
be
perfect

furnish
with

quality

virtue

I

one
can

it
do

tire

up

stoutly

interrupt
:

have
his

<EOS>
this
phrase
,
in
its
senseless
arrogance

quite
cure
me
of
the
temporary
weakness
which
have
make
me
relax
my
tone

<EOS>
She
rattle
on
:
  
"
My

be
to

youth

not

to
this

that

<EOS>
when
first
I
see
Isidore
,
I
believe
he
would
help
me
to
enjoy
it

I
believe
he
would
be
content
with
my
be
a
pretty

that
we
should
meet

part

flutter
about

Lo

I
find
him

She
look
for

tirade

I
give

I
now

DR
JOHN
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
be
a
most
consistent
character
;
forbear
with
all
the
world
,
and
tender
to
no
part
of
it
.
<EOS>
Her
own
child
draw
her
into
no
deviation
from
the
even
tenor
of
her
stoic
calm
.
<EOS>
She
be
solicitous
about
her
family
,
vigilant
for
their
interest
and
physical
well
-
being
;
but
she
never
seem
to
know
the
wish
to
take
her
little
child
upon
her
lap
,
to
press
their
rosy
lip
with
her
own
,
to
gather
them
in
a
genial
embrace
,
to
shower
on
them
softly
the
benignant
caress
,
the
loving
word
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
watch
her
sometimes
sit
in
the
garden
,
view
the
little
bee
afar
off
,
as
they
walk
in
a
distant
alley
with
Trinette
,
their
_
bonne
_
;
in
her
mien
speak
care
and
prudence
.
<EOS>
I
know
she
often
ponder
anxiously
what
she
call
"
leur
avenir
;
"
but
if
the
young
,
a
puny
and
delicate
but
engage
child
,
chance
to
spy
her
,
break
from
its
nurse
,
and
toddle
down
the
walk
,
come
all
eager
and
laugh
and
pant
to
clasp
her
knee
,
Madame
would
just
calmly
put
out
one
hand
,
so
as
to
prevent
inconvenient
concussion
from
the
child
's
sudden
onset
:
"
Prends
garde
,
mon
enfant
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
would
say
unmoved
,
patiently
permit
it
to
stand
near
her
a
few
moment
,
and
then
,
without
smile
or
kiss
,
or
endearing
syllable
,
rise
and
lead
it
back
to
Trinette
.
  
<EOS>
Her
demeanour
to
the
eld
girl
be
equally
characteristic
in
another
way
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
vicious
child
.
"
<EOS>
Quelle
peste
que
cette
<EOS>
Désirée
!
<EOS>
Quel
poison
que
cet
enfant
là
!
"
be
the
expression
dedicate
to
her
,
alike
in
kitchen
and
in
schoolroom
.
<EOS>
amongst
her
other
endowment
she
boast
an
exquisite
skill
in
the
art
,
of
provocation
,
sometimes
drive
her
_
bonne
_
and
the
servant
almost
wild
.
<EOS>
She
would
steal
to
their
attic
,
open
their
drawer
and
box
,
wantonly
tear
their
good
cap
and
soil
their
good
shawl
;
she
would
watch
her
opportunity
to
get
at
the
buffet
of
the
salle
-
à
-
manger
,
where
she
would
smash
article
of
porcelain
or
glass
 
or
to
the
cupboard
of
the
storeroom
,
where
she
would
plunder
the
preserve
,
drink
the
sweet
wine
,
break
jar
and
bottle
,
and
so
contrive
as
to
throw
the
onus
of
suspicion
on
the
cook
and
the
kitchen
-
maid
.
<EOS>
all
this
when
Madame
see
,
and
of
which
when
she
receive
report
,
her
sole
observation
,
utter
with
matchless
serenity
,
be
:
  
"
Désirée
a
besoin
d'une
surveillance
toute
particulière
.
"
<EOS>
accordingly
she
keep
this
promising
olive
-
branch
a
good
deal
at
her
side
.
<EOS>
never
once
,
I
believe
,
do
she
tell
her
faithfully
of
her
fault
,
explain
the
evil
of
such
habit
,
and
show
the
result
which
must
thence
ensue
.
<EOS>
surveillance
must
work
the
whole
cure
.
<EOS>
It
fail
of
course
.
<EOS>
Désirée
be
keep
in
some
measure
from
the
servant
,
but
she
tease
and
pillage
her
mamma
instead
.
<EOS>
whatever
belong
to
Madame
's
work
-
table
or
toilet
she
could
lay
her
hand
on
,
she
steal
and
hide
.
<EOS>
Madame
see
all
this
,
but
she
still
pretend
not
to
see
:
she
have
not
rectitude
of
soul
to
confront
the
child
with
her
vice
.
<EOS>
when
an
article
disappear
whose
value
render
restitution
necessary
,
she
would
profess
to
think
that
Désirée
have
take
it
away
in
play
,
and
beg
her
to
restore
it
.
<EOS>
Désirée
be
not
to
be
so
cheat
:
she
have
learn
to
bring
falsehood
to
the
aid
of
theft
,
and
would
deny
have
touch
the
brooch
,
ring
,
or
scissor
.
<EOS>
carry
on
the
hollow
system
,
the
mother
would
calmly
assume
an
air
of
belief
,
and
afterwards
ceaselessly
watch
and
dog
the
child
till
she
track
her
:
to
her
hiding
-
place
 
some
hole
in
the
garden
-
wall
 
<EOS>
some
chink
or
cranny
in
garret
or
out
-
house
.
<EOS>
this
done
,
Madame
would
send
Désirée
out
for
a
walk
with
her
_
bonne
_
,
and
profit
by
her
absence
to
rob
the
robber
.
<EOS>
Désirée
prove
herself
the
true
daughter
of
her
astute
parent
,
by
never
suffer
either
her
countenance
or
manner
to
betray
the
least
sign
of
mortification
on
discover
the
loss
.
  
<EOS>
the
second
child
,
Fifine
,
be
say
to
be
like
its
dead
father
.
<EOS>
certainly
,
though
the
mother
have
give
it
her
healthy
frame
,
her
blue
eye
and
ruddy
cheek
,
not
from
her
be
derive
its
moral
being
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
honest
,
gleeful
little
soul
:
<EOS>
a
passionate
,
warm
-
tempered
,
bustle
creature
it
be
too
,
and
of
the
sort
likely
to
blunder
often
into
peril
and
difficulty
.
<EOS>
one
day
it
bethink
itself
to
fall
from
top
to
bottom
of
a
steep
flight
of
stone
step
;
and
when
Madame
,
hear
the
noise
(
she
always
hear
every
noise
)
,
issue
from
the
salle
-
à
-
manger
and
pick
it
up
<EOS>
,
she
say
quietly
,
 
<EOS>
"
cet
enfant
a
un
os
cassé
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
at
first
we
hope
this
be
not
the
case
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
however
,
but
too
true
:
one
little
plump
arm
hang
powerless
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
Meess
"
(
mean
me
)
<EOS>
"
take
her
,
"
say
Madame
;
"
et
<EOS>
qu'on
aille
tout
de
suite
chercher
un
fiacre
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
a
_
fiacre
_
she
promptly
,
but
with
admirable
coolness
and
self
-
possession
,
depart
to
fetch
a
surgeon
.
  
<EOS>
It
appear
she
do
not
find
the
family
-
surgeon
at
home
;
but
that
matter
not
:
she
seek
until
she
lay
her
hand
on
a
substitute
to
her
mind
,
and
bring
him
back
with
her
.
<EOS>
meantime
I
have
cut
the
child
's
sleeve
from
its
arm
,
undress
and
put
it
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
We
none
of
us
,
I
suppose
(
by
_
<EOS>
we
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
mean
the
bonne
,
the
cook
,
the
portress
,
and
myself
,
all
which
personage
be
now
gather
in
the
small
and
heated
chamber
)
,
look
very
scrutinizingly
at
the
new
doctor
when
he
come
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
I
,
at
least
,
be
take
up
with
endeavour
to
soothe
Fifine
;
whose
cry
(
for
she
have
good
lung
)
<EOS>
be
appalling
to
hear
.
<EOS>
these
cry
redouble
in
intensity
as
the
stranger
approach
her
bed
;
when
he
take
her
up
,
"
let
alone
!
"
<EOS>
she
cry
passionately
,
in
her
broken
English
(
for
she
speak
English
as
do
the
other
child
)
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
you
:
I
will
Dr.
Pillule
!
"
  
"
and
Dr.
Pillule
be
my
very
good
friend
,
"
be
the
answer
,
in
perfect
English
;
"
but
he
be
busy
at
a
place
three
league
off
,
and
I
be
come
in
his
stead
.
<EOS>
so
now
,
when
we
get
a
little
calm
,
we
must
commence
business
;
and
we
will
soon
have
that
unlucky
little
arm
bandage
and
in
right
order
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hereupon
he
call
for
a
glass
of
_
eau
sucrée
_
,
feed
her
with
some
teaspoonful
of
the
sweet
liquid
<EOS>
(
Fifine
be
a
frank
gourmande
;
anybody
could
win
her
heart
through
her
palate
)
,
promise
her
more
when
the
operation
should
be
over
,
and
promptly
go
to
work
.
<EOS>
some
assistance
be
need
,
he
demand
it
of
the
cook
,
a
robust
,
strong
-
armed
woman
;
but
she
,
the
portress
,
and
the
nurse
instantly
flee
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
to
touch
that
small
,
tortured
limb
,
but
think
there
be
no
alternative
,
my
hand
be
already
extend
to
do
what
be
requisite
.
<EOS>
I
be
anticipate
;
Madame
Beck
have
put
out
her
own
hand
:
hers
be
steady
while
mine
tremble
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ca
vaudra
mieux
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
turn
from
me
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
show
wisdom
in
his
choice
.
<EOS>
Mine
would
have
be
feign
stoicism
,
force
fortitude
.
<EOS>
her
be
neither
force
nor
feign
.
  
<EOS>
"
Merci
,
Madame
;
très
bien
,
fort
bien

"
say
the
operator
when
he
have
finish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Voilà

<EOS>
He
be
pleased
with
her
firmness

<EOS>
she
with
his
compliment

<EOS>
It
be
likely

too

<EOS>
that
his
whole
general
appearance
,
his
voice
,
mien
,
and
manner

work
impression
in

<EOS>
indeed

when
you
look
well
at
him
,
and
when
a
lamp
be
bring
in
 
for
it
be
evening
and
now
wax
dusk
 
<EOS>
you
see
that
,
unless
Madame
Beck
have
be
less
than
woman
,
it
could
not
well
be
otherwise
.
<EOS>
this
young
doctor
(
he
_
be
_
young
)
have
no
common
aspect
.
<EOS>
His
stature
look
imposingly
tall
in
that
little
chamber
,
and
amidst
that
group
of
Dutch
-
make
woman
;
his
profile
be
clear
,
fine
and
expressive
:
perhaps
his
eye
glance
from
face
to
face
rather
too
vividly
,
too
quickly
,
and
too
often
;
but
it
have
a
most
pleasant
character
,
and
so
have
his
mouth
;
his
chin
be
full
,
cleft
,
Grecian
,
and
perfect
.
<EOS>
as
to
his
smile
,
one
could
not
in
a
hurry
make
up
one
's
mind
as
to
the
descriptive
epithet
it
merit
;
there
be
something
in
it
that
please
,
but
something
too
that
bring
surge
up
into
the
mind
all
one
's
foible
and
weak
point
:
all
that
could
lay
one
open
to
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
yet
Fifine
like
this
doubtful
smile
,
and
think
the
owner
genial
:
much
as
he
have
hurt
her
,
she
hold
out
her
hand
to
bid
him
a
friendly
good
-
night
.
<EOS>
He
pat
the
little
hand
kindly
,
and
then
he
and
Madame
go
down
-
stair
together
;
she
talk
in
her
high
tide
of
spirit
and
volubility
,
he
listen
with
an
air
of
good
-
natured
amenity
,
dash
with
that
unconscious
roguish
<EOS>
archness
<EOS>
I
find
it
difficult
to
describe
.
  
<EOS>
I
notice
that
though
he
speak
French
well
,
he
speak
English
better
;
he
have
,
too
,
an
english
complexion
,
eye
,
and
form
.
<EOS>
I
notice
more
.
<EOS>
as
he
pass
me
in
leave
the
room
,
turn
his
face
in
my
direction
one
moment
 
not
to
address
me
,
but
to
speak
to
Madame
,
yet
so
stand
,
that
I
almost
necessarily
look
up
at
him
 
a
recollection
which
have
be
struggle
to
form
in
my
memory
,
since
the
first
moment
I
hear
his
voice
,
start
up
perfect
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
very
gentleman
to
whom
I
have
speak
at
the
bureau
;
who
have
help
me
in
the
matter
of
the
trunk
;
who
have
be
my
guide
through
the
dark
,
wet
park
.
<EOS>
listening
,
as
he
pass
down
the
long
vestibule
out
into
the
street
,
I
recognise
his
very
tread
:
it
be
the
same
firm
and
equal
stride
<EOS>
I
have
follow
under
the
drip
tree
.
     
<EOS>
It
be
,
to
be
conclude
that
this
young
surgeon
-
physician
's
first
visit
to
the
Rue
Fossette
would
be
the
last
.
<EOS>
the
respectable
Dr.
Pillule
be
expect
home
the
next
day
,
there
appear
no
reason
why
his
temporary
substitute
should
again
represent
him
;
but
the
Fates
have
write
their
decree
to
the
contrary
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Pillule
have
be
summon
to
see
a
rich
old
hypochondriac
at
the
antique
university
town
of
Bouquin
-
Moisi
,
and
upon
his
prescribe
change
of
air
and
travel
as
remedy
,
he
be
retain
to
accompany
the
timid
patient
on
a
tour
of
some
week
;
it
but
remain
,
therefore
,
for
the
new
doctor
to
continue
his
attendance
at
the
Rue
Fossette
.
  
<EOS>
I
often
see
him
when
he
come
;
for
Madame
would
not
trust
the
little
invalid
to
Trinette
,
but
require
me
to
spend
much
of
my
time
in
the
nursery
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
be
skilful
.
<EOS>
Fifine
recover
rapidly
under
his
care
,
yet
even
her
convalescence
do
not
hasten
his
dismissal
.
<EOS>
Destiny
and
Madame
Beck
seem
in
league
,
and
both
have
rule
that
he
should
make
deliberate
acquaintance
with
the
vestibule
,
the
private
staircase
and
upper
chamber
of
the
Rue
Fossette
.
  
<EOS>
no
sooner
do
Fifine
emerge
from
his
hand
than
Désirée
declare
herself
ill
.
<EOS>
that
possess
child
have
a
genius
for
simulation
,
and
captivate
by
the
attention
and
indulgence
of
a
sick
-
room
<EOS>
,
she
come
to
the
conclusion
that
an
illness
would
perfectly
accommodate
her
taste
,
and
take
her
bed
accordingly
.
<EOS>
She
act
well
,
and
her
mother
still
better
;
for
while
the
whole
case
be
transparent
to
Madame
Beck
as
the
day
,
she
treat
it
with
an
astonishingly
well
-
assure
air
of
gravity
and
good
faith
.
  
<EOS>
what
surprise
me
be
,
that
Dr.
John
(
so
the
young
Englishman
have
teach
Fifine
to
call
him
,
and
we
all
take
from
her
the
habit
of
address
him
by
this
name
,
till
it
become
an
establish
custom
,
and
he
be
know
by
no
other
in
the
Rue
Fossette
)
 
<EOS>
that
Dr.
John
consent
tacitly
to
adopt
Madame
's
tactic
,
and
to
fall
in
with
her
manoeuvre
.
<EOS>
He
betray
,
indeed
,
a
period
of
comic
doubt
,
cast
one
or
two
rapid
glance
from
the
child
to
the
mother
,
indulge
in
an
interval
of
self
-
consultation
,
but
finally
resign
himself
with
a
good
grace
to
play
his
part
in
the
farce
.
<EOS>
Désirée
eat
like
a
raven
,
gambol
day
and
night
in
her
bed
,
pitch
tent
with
the
sheet
and
blanket
,
lounge
like
a
Turk
amidst
pillow
and
bolster
,
divert
herself
with
throw
her
shoe
at
her
bonne
and
grimacing
at
her
sister
 
over
-
flow
,
in
short
,
with
unmerited
health
and
evil
spirit
;
only
languish
when
her
mamma
and
the
physician
pay
their
diurnal
visit
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
,
I
know
,
be
glad
,
at
any
price
,
to
have
her
daughter
in
bed
out
of
the
way
of
mischief
;
but
I
wonder
that
Dr.
John
do
not
tire
of
the
business
.
  
<EOS>
every
day
,
on
this
mere
pretext
of
a
motive
,
he
give
punctual
attendance
;
Madame
always
receive
him
with
the
same
empressement
,
the
same
sunshine
for
himself
,
the
same
admirably
counterfeit
air
of
concern
for
her
child
.
<EOS>
Dr.
John
write
harmless
prescription
for
the
patient
,
and
view
her
mother
with
a
shrewdly
sparkling
eye
.
<EOS>
Madame
catch
his
rallying
look
without
resent
them
 
<EOS>
she
have
too
much
good
sense
for
that
.
<EOS>
supple
as
the
young
doctor
seem
,
one
could
not
despise
him
 
this
pliant
part
be
evidently
not
adopt
in
the
design
to
curry
favour
with
his
employer
:
while
he
like
his
office
at
the
pensionnat
,
and
linger
strangely
about
the
Rue
Fossette
,
he
be
independent
,
almost
careless
in
his
carriage
there
;
and
yet
,
too
,
he
be
often
thoughtful
and
preoccupied
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
perhaps
my
business
to
observe
the
mystery
of
his
bearing
,
or
search
out
its
origin
or
aim
;
but
,
place
as
I
be
,
I
could
hardly
help
it
.
<EOS>
He
lay
himself
open
to
my
observation
,
accord
to
my
presence
in
the
room
just
that
degree
of
notice
and
consequence
a
person
of
my
exterior
habitually
expect
:
that
be
to
say
,
about
what
be
give
to
unobtrusive
article
of
furniture
,
chair
of
ordinary
joiner
's
work
,
and
carpet
of
no
strike
pattern
.
<EOS>
often
,
while
wait
for
Madame
,
he
would
muse
,
smile
,
watch
,
or
listen
like
a
man
who
think
himself
alone
.
<EOS>
I
,
meantime
,
be
free
to
puzzle
over
his
countenance
and
movement
,
and
wonder
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
that
peculiar
interest
and
attachment
 
all
mix
up
with
doubt
and
strangeness
,
and
inexplicably
rule
by
some
preside
spell
 
which
wed
him
to
this
demi
-
convent
,
seclude
in
the
build
-
up
core
of
a
capital
.
<EOS>
He
,
I
believe
,
never
remember
that
I
have
eye
in
my
head
,
much
less
a
brain
behind
them
.
  
<EOS>
nor
would
he
ever
have
find
this
out
,
but
that
one
day
,
while
he
sit
in
the
sunshine
and
I
be
observe
the
colouring
of
his
hair
,
whisker
,
and
complexion
 
<EOS>
the
whole
being
of
such
a
tone
as
a
strong
light
bring
out
with
somewhat
perilous
force
(
indeed
I
recollect
I
be
drive
to
compare
his
beamy
head
in
my
thought
to
that
of
the
"
golden
image
"
which
Nebuchadnezzar
the
king
have
set
up
)
,
an
idea
new
,
sudden
,
and
startling
,
rivet
my
attention
with
an
over
-
master
strength
and
power
of
attraction
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
to
this
day
how
I
look
at
him
:
<EOS>
the
force
of
surprise
,
and
also
of
conviction
,
make
me
forget
myself
;
and
I
only
recover
wonte
consciousness
when
I
see
that
his
notice
be
arrest
,
and
that
it
have
catch
my
movement
in
a
clear
little
oval
mirror
fix
in
the
side
of
the
window
recess
 
by
the
aid
of
which
<EOS>
reflector
Madame
often
secretly
spy
person
walk
in
the
garden
below
.
<EOS>
though
of
so
gay
and
sanguine
a
temperament
,
he
be
not
without
a
certain
nervous
sensitiveness
which
make
him
ill
at
ease
under
a
direct
,
inquire
gaze
.
<EOS>
on
surprise
me
thus
,
he
turn
and
say
,
in
a
tone
which
,
though
courteous
,
have
just
so
much
dryness
in
it
as
to
mark
a
shade
of
annoyance
,
as
well
as
to
give
to
what
be
say
the
character
of
rebuke
,
"
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
do
not
spare
me
:
I
be
not
vain
enough
to
fancy
that
it
be
my
merit
which
attract
her
attention
;
it
must
then
be
some
defect
.
<EOS>
dare
<EOS>
I
ask
 
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
confound
,
as
the
reader
may
suppose
,
yet
not
with
an
irrecoverable
confusion
;
be
conscious
that
it
be
from
no
emotion
of
incautious
admiration
,
nor
yet
in
a
spirit
of
unjustifiable
inquisitiveness
,
that
I
have
incur
this
reproof
.
<EOS>
I
may
have
clear
myself
on
the
spot
,
but
would
not
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
speak
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
in
the
habit
of
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
suffer
him
,
then
,
to
think
what
he
choose
and
accuse
me
of
what
he
would
,
I
resume
some
work
I
have
drop
,
and
keep
my
head
bent
over
it
during
the
remainder
of
his
stay
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
perverse
mood
of
the
mind
which
be
rather
soothe
than
irritate
by
misconstruction
;
and
in
quarter
where
we
can
never
be
rightly
know
,
we
take
pleasure
,
I
think
,
in
be
consummately
ignore
.
<EOS>
what
honest

conjure
his

of

ailment

"
<EOS>
now
,
at
last
,
"
I
think
,
"
Dr.
Pillule
must
be
recall
:
the
prudent
directress
will
never
venture
to
permit
the
attendance
of
so
young
a
man
on
the
pupil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
directress
be
very
prudent
,
but
she
could
also
be
intrepidly
venturous
.
<EOS>
She
actually
introduce
Dr.
John
to
the
school
-
division
of
the
premise
,
and
establish
him
in
attendance
on
the
proud
and
handsome
Blanche
de
Melcy
,
and
the
vain
,
flirt
Angélique
,
her
friend

<EOS>
Dr.
John
,
I
think
,
testify
a
certain
gratification
at
this
mark
of
confidence
;
and
if
discretion
of
bearing
could
have
justify
the
step
,
it
would
by
him
have
be
amply
justify
.
<EOS>
here
,
however
,
in
this
land
of
convent
and
confessional
,
such
a
presence
as
his
be
not
to
be
suffer
with
impunity
in

never
fully
understand
why
she
thus
risk
her
interest
for
the
sake
of
Dr.
John
.
<EOS>
what
people
say
,
of
course
I
know
well
:
<EOS>
the
whole
house
 
pupil
,
teacher
,
servant
include
 
affirm
that
she
be
go
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
so
they
have
settle
it
;
difference
of
age
seem
to
make
no
obstacle
in
their
eye
:
<EOS>
it
be
to
be
so
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
admit
that
appearance
do
not
wholly
discountenance
this
idea
;
Madame
seem
so
bent
on
retain
his
service
,
so
oblivious
of
her
former
protégé
,
Pillule
.
<EOS>
She
make
,
too
,
such
a
point
of
personally
receive
his
visit
,
and
be
so
unfailingly
cheerful
,
blithe
,
and
benignant
in
her
manner
to
him
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
she
pay
,
about
this
time
,
mark
attention
to
dress
:
<EOS>
the
morning
dishabille
,
the
nightcap
and
shawl
,
be
discard
;
Dr.
John
's
early
visit
always
find
her
with
auburn
braid
all
nicely
arrange
,
silk
dress
trimly
fit
on
,
neat
laced
brodequin
in
lieu
of
slipper
:
in
short
the
whole
toilette
complete
as
a
model
,
and
fresh
as
a
flower
.
<EOS>
I
scarcely
think
,
however
,
that
her
intention
in
this
go
further
than
just
to
show
a
very
handsome
man
that
she
be
not
quite
a
plain
woman
;
and
plain
she
be
not
.
<EOS>
without
beauty
of
feature
or
elegance
of
form
,
she
please
.
<EOS>
without
youth
and
its
gay
grace
,
she
cheer
.
<EOS>
one
never
tired
of
see
her
:
she
be
never
monotonous
,
or
insipid
,
or
colourless
,
or
flat
.
<EOS>
Her
unfaded
hair
,
her
eye
with
its
temperate
blue
light
,
her
cheek
with
its
wholesome
fruit
-
like
bloom
 
<EOS>
these
thing
please
in
moderation
,
but
with
constancy
.
  
<EOS>
have
she
,
indeed
,
float
vision
of
adopt
Dr.
John
as
a
husband
,
take
him
to
her
well
-
furnish
home
,
endow
him
with
her
saving
,
which
be
say
to
amount
to
a
moderate
competency
,
and
make
him
comfortable
for
the
rest
of
his
life
?
<EOS>
do
Dr.
John
suspect
her
of
such
vision
?
<EOS>
I
have
meet
him
come
out
of
her
presence
with
a
mischievous
half
-
smile
about
his
lip
,
and
in
his
eye
a
look
as
of
masculine
vanity
elate
and
tickle
.
<EOS>
with
all
his
good
look
and
good
-
nature
,
he
be
not
perfect
;
he
must
have
be
very
imperfect
if
he
roguishly
encourage
aim
he
never
intend
to
be
successful
.
<EOS>
but
do
he
not
intend
them
to
be
successful
?
<EOS>
People
say
he
have
no
money
,
that
he
be
wholly
dependent
upon
his
profession
.
<EOS>
Madame
 
<EOS>
though
perhaps
some
fourteen
year
his
senior
 
be
yet
the
sort
of
woman
never
to
grow
old
,
never
to
wither
,
never
to
break
down
.
<EOS>
They
certainly
be
on
good
term
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
perhaps
be
not
in
love
;
but
how
many
people
ever
_
<EOS>
do
_
love
,
or
at
least
marry
for
love
,
in
this
world
.
<EOS>
We
wait
the
end
.
  
<EOS>
for
what
_
he
_
wait
,
I
do
not
know
,
nor
for
what
he
watch
;
but
the
peculiarity
of
his
manner
,
his
expectant
,
vigilant
,
absorb
,
eager
look
,
never
wear
off
:
it
rather
intensify
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
be
quite
within
the
compass
of
my
penetration
,
and
I
think
he
range
farther
and
farther
beyond
it
.
  
<EOS>
one
morning
little
Georgette
have
be
more
feverish
and
consequently
more
peevish
;
she
be
cry
,
and
would
not
be
pacify
.
<EOS>
I
think
a
particular
draught
order
,
disagree
with
her
,
and
I
doubt
whether
it
ought
to
be
continue
;
I
wait
impatiently
for
the
doctor
be
come
in
order
to
consult
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
door
-
bell
rang
,
he
be
admit
;
I
feel
sure
of
this
,
for
I
hear
his
voice
address
the
portress
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
custom
to
mount
straight
to
the
nursery
,
take
about
three
degree
of
the
staircase
at
once
,
and
come
upon
us
like
a
cheerful
surprise
.
<EOS>
five
minute
elapse
 
ten
 
<EOS>
and
I
see
and
hear
nothing
of
him
.
<EOS>
what
could
he
be
do
?
<EOS>
possibly
wait
in
the
corridor
below
.
<EOS>
little
Georgette
still
pipe
her
plaintive
wail
,
appeal
to
me
by
her
familiar
term
,
"
Minnie
,
Minnie
,
me
very
poorly
!
"
<EOS>
till
my
heart
ache
.
<EOS>
I
descend
to
ascertain
why
he
do
not
come
.
<EOS>
the
corridor
be
empty
.
<EOS>
Whither
be
he
vanish
?
<EOS>
be
he
with
Madame
in
the
_
salle
-
à
-
manger
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Impossible
:
I
have
leave
her
but
a
short
time
since
,
dress
in
her
own
chamber
.
<EOS>
I
listen
.
<EOS>
three
pupil
be
just
then
hard
at
work
practise
in
three
proximate
room
 
the
dining
-
room
and
the
great
and
less
drawing
-
room
,
between
which
and
the
corridor
there
be
but
the
portress
's
cabinet
communicate
with
the
salon
,
and
intend
originally
for
a
boudoir
.
<EOS>
farther
off
,
at
a
fourth
instrument
in
the
oratory
,
a
whole
class
of
a
dozen
or
more
be
take
a
singing
lesson
,
and
just
then
join
in
a
"
barcarole
"
(
I
think
they
call
it
)
<EOS>
,
whereof
I
yet
remember
these
word
"
fraîchë
,
"
"
brisë
,
"
and
"
Venisë
.
"
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
,
what
could
I
hear
?
<EOS>
a
great
deal
,
certainly
;
have
it
only
be
to
the
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
yes
<EOS>
;
I
hear
a
giddy
treble
laugh
in
the
above
-
mention
little
cabinet
,
close
by
the
door
of
which
I
stand
 
that
door
half
-
unclosed
;
a
man
's
voice
in
a
soft
,
deep
,
plead
tone
,
utter
some
,
word
,
whereof
I
only
catch
the
adjuration
,
"
<EOS>
for
God
's
sake
!
"
<EOS>
then
,
after
a
second
's
pause
,
forth
issue
Dr.
John
,
his
eye
full
shining
,
but
not
with
either
joy
or
triumph
;
his
fair
english
cheek
high
-
coloured
;
a
baffle
,
tortured
,
anxious
,
and
yet
a
tender
meaning
on
his
brow
.
  
<EOS>
the
open
door
serve
me
as
a
screen
;
but
have
I
be
full
in
his
way
<EOS>
,
I
believe
he
would
have
pass
without
see
me
.
<EOS>
some
mortification
,
some
strong
vexation
have
hold
of
his
soul
:
or
rather
,
to
write
my
impression
now
as
I
receive
them
at
the
time
I
should
say
some
sorrow
,
some
sense
of
injustice
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
so
much
think
his
pride
be
hurt
,
as
that
his
affection
have
be
wound
 
cruelly
wound
,
it
seem
to
me
.
<EOS>
but
who
be
the
torturer
?
<EOS>
what
be
in
that
house
have
him
so
much
in
her
power
?
<EOS>
Madame
I
believe
to
be
in
her
chamber
;
the
room
whence
he
have
step
be
dedicate
to
the
portress
's
sole
use
;
and
she
,
Rosine
Matou
,
an
unprincipled
though
pretty
little
french
grisette
,
airy
,
fickle
,
dressy
,
vain
,
and
mercenary
 
<EOS>
it
be
not
,
surely
,
to
_
<EOS>
her
_
hand
he
owe
the
ordeal
through
which
he
seem
to
have
pass
?
  
<EOS>
but
while
I
ponder
,
her
voice
,
clear
,
though
somewhat
sharp
,
break
out
in
a
lightsome
french
song
,
trill
through
the
door
<EOS>
still
ajar
:
I
glance
in
,
doubt
my
sense
.
<EOS>
there
at
the
table
she
sit
in
a
smart
dress
of
"
jaconas
rise
,
"
trim
a
tiny
blond
cap
:
not
a
live
thing
save
herself
be
in
the
room
,
except
indeed
some
gold
fish
in
a
glass
globe
,
some
flower
in
pot
,
and
a
broad
July
sunbeam
.
  
<EOS>
here
be
a
problem
:
but
I
must
go
up
-
stair
to
ask
about
the
medicine
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
John
sit
in
a
chair
at
Georgette
's
bedside
;
Madame
stand
before
him
;
the
little
patient
have
be
examine
and
soothe
,
and
now
lay
compose
in
her
crib
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
,
as
I
enter
,
be
discuss
the
physician
's
own
health
,
remark
on
some
real
or
fancied
change
in
his
look
,
charge
him
with
over
-
work
,
and
recommend
rest
and
change
of
air
.
<EOS>
He
listen
good
-
naturedly
,
but
with
laugh
indifference
,
tell
her
that
she
be
"
trop
bonne
,
"
and
that
he
feel
perfectly
well
.
<EOS>
Madame
appeal
to
me
 
Dr.
John
follow
her
movement
with
a
slow
glance
which
seem
to
express
languid
surprise
at
reference
be
make
to
a
quarter
so
insignificant
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think
,
Miss
Lucie
?
"
ask
Madame
.
<EOS>
"
be
he
not
paler
and
thin
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
very
seldom
that
I
utter
more
than
monosyllable
in
Dr.
John
's
presence
;
he
be
the
kind
of
person
with
whom
I
be
likely
ever
to
remain
the
neutral
,
passive
thing
he
think
me
.
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
I
take
licence
to
answer
in
a
phrase
:
and
a
phrase
I
purposely
make
quite
significant
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
look
ill
at
this
moment
;
but
perhaps
it
be
owe
to
some
temporary
cause
:
Dr.
John
may
have
be
vex
or
harass
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
how
he
take
this
speech
,
as
I
never
seek
his
face
for
information
.
<EOS>
Georgette
here
begin
to
ask
me
in
her
break
English
if
she
may
have
a
glass
of
_
eau
<EOS>
sucrée
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
I
answer
her
in
English
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
,
I
fancy
,
he
notice
that
I
speak
his
language
;
hitherto
he
have
always
take
me
for
a
foreigner
,
address
me
as
"
Mademoiselle
,
"
and
give
in
French
the
requisite
direction
about
the
child
's
treatment
.
<EOS>
He
seem
on
the
point
of
make
a
remark
;
but
think
well
of
it
,
hold
his
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
recommence
advise
him
;
he
shake
his
head
,
laughing
,
rise
and
bid
her
good
-
morning
,
with
courtesy
,
but
still
with
the
regardless
air
of
one
whom
too
much
unsolicited
attention
be
surfeit
and
spoil
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
be
go
,
Madame
drop
into
the
chair
he
have
just
leave
;
she
rest
her
chin
in
her
hand
;
all
that
be
animate
and
amiable
vanish
from
her
face
:
she
look
stony
and
stern
,
almost
mortified
and
morose
.
<EOS>
She
sigh
;
a
single
,
but
a
deep
sigh
.
<EOS>
a
loud
bell
ring
for
morning
-
school
.
<EOS>
She
get
up
;
as
she
pass
a
dressing
-
table
with
a
glass
upon
it
,
she
look
at
her
reflect
image
.
<EOS>
one
single
white
hair
streak
her
nut
-
brown
tress
;
she
pluck
it
out
with
a
shudder
.
<EOS>
in
the
full
summer
daylight
,
her
face
,
though
it
still
have
the
colour
,
could
plainly
be
see
to
have
lose
the
texture
of
youth
;
and
then
,
where
be
youth
's
contours
?
<EOS>
ah
,
Madame
!
<EOS>
wise
as
you
be
,
even
_
<EOS>
you
_
know
weakness
.
<EOS>
never
have
I
pity
Madame
before
,
but
my
heart
soften
towards
her
,
when
she
turn
darkly
from
the
glass
.
<EOS>
a
calamity
have
come
upon
her
.
<EOS>
that
hag
Disappointment
be
greet
her
with
a
grisly
"
all
-
hail
,
"
and
her
soul
reject
the
intimacy
.
  
<EOS>
but
Rosine
!
<EOS>
My
bewilderment
there
surpass
description
.
<EOS>
I
embrace
five
opportunity
of
pass
her
cabinet
that
day
,
with
a
view
to
contemplate
her
charm
,
and
find
out
the
secret
of
their
influence
.
<EOS>
She
be
pretty
,
young
,
and
wear
a
well
-
make
dress
.
<EOS>
all
very
good
point
,
and
,
I
suppose
,
amply
sufficient
to
account
,
in
any
philosophic
mind
,
for
any
amount
of
agony
and
distraction
in
a
young
man
,
like
Dr.
John
.
<EOS>
still
,
I
could
not
help
form
half
a
wish
that
the
say
doctor
be
my
brother
;
or
at
least
that
he
have
a
sister
or
a
mother
who
would
kindly
sermonize
him
.
<EOS>
I
say
_
half
_
<EOS>
a
wish
<EOS>
;
I
break
it
,
and
fling
it
away
before
it
become
a
whole
one
,
discover
in
good
time
its
exquisite
folly
.
<EOS>
"
somebody
,
"
I
argue
,
"
may
as
well
sermonize
Madame
about
her
young
physician
:
and
what
good
would
that
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
believe
Madame
sermonize
herself
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
behave
weakly
,
or
make
herself
in
any
shape
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
she
have
neither
strong
feeling
to
overcome
,
nor
tender
feeling
by
which
to
be
miserably
pain
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
likewise
that
she
have
an
important
avocation
,
a
real
business
to
fill
her
time
,
divert
her
thought
,
and
divide
her
interest
.
<EOS>
It
be
especially
true
that
she
possess
a
genuine
good
sense
which
be
not
give
to
all
woman
nor
to
all
man
;
and
by
dint
of
these
combine
advantage
she
behave
wisely
 
she
behave
well
.
<EOS>
brava
!
<EOS>
once
more
,
Madame
Beck
.
<EOS>
I
see
you
match
against
an
Apollyon
of
a
predilection
;
you
fight
a
good
fight
,
and
you
overcome
!
    
<EOS>
the
CASKET
.
  
<EOS>
behind
the
house
at
the
Rue
Fossette
there
be
a
garden
 
large
,
consider
that
it
lie
in
the
heart
of
a
city
,
and
to
my
recollection
at
this
day
it
seem
pleasant
:
but
time
,
like
distance
,
lend
to
certain
scene
an
influence
so
soften
;
and
where
all
be
stone
around
,
blank
wall
and
hot
pavement
<EOS>
,
how
precious
seem
one
shrub
,
how
lovely
an
enclosed
and
planted
spot
of
ground
!
  
<EOS>
there
go
a
tradition
that
Madame
Beck
's
house
have
in
old
day
<EOS>
be
a
convent
.
<EOS>
that
in
year
go
by
 
<EOS>
how
long
go
by
I
can
not
tell
,
but
I
think
some
century
 
before
the
city
have
over
-
spread
this
quarter
,
and
when
it
be
till
ground
and
avenue
,
and
such
deep
and
leafy
seclusion
as
ought
to
embosom
a
religious
house
-
that
something
have
happen
on
this
site
which
,
rouse
fear
and
inflicting
horror
,
have
leave
to
the
place
the
inheritance
of

a
vague
tale
go

nun

sometimes

on
some
night
or
night
of
the

see
in

of
this

<EOS>
the
ghost
must
have
be
build
out
some
age
ago
,
for
there
be
house
all

certain
convent

the

of

a
Methuselah
of
a

tree

<EOS>
dead
,
all
but
a

which
still
faithfully
renew
their
perfumed
snow

and
their
honey

sweet
pendant
in
autumn
 
<EOS>
you
see
,
in
scrape
away
the
mossy
earth
between
the
half

bare
root
,
a
glimpse
of
slab

smooth

<EOS>
the
legend
go

unconfirmed
and
unaccredited

but
still
propagate
,
that
this
be
the
portal
of
a
vault

imprison
deep
beneath
that
ground
,
on
whose
surface
grass
grow
and
flower
bloom
,
the
bone
of
a

whom
a
monkish
conclave
of

bury
alive
for
some

Her

on
summer
morning
I
use
to
rise
early

to
enjoy
them
alone
;
on
summer
evening
,
to
linger
solitary
,
to
keep
tryste
with
the
rise
moon
,
or
taste
one
kiss
of
the
evening
breeze
,
or
fancy
rather
than

<EOS>
the

verdant

the

beautiful
about

<EOS>
there
be
a
large
berceau

above
which
spread
the
shade
of
an
acacia
;
there
be
a
small
,
more
sequestered
bower
,
nestle
in
the
vine
which
run
all
along
a
high
and
grey
wall
,
and
gather
their
tendril
in
a
knot
of
beauty
,
and
hang
their
cluster
in
love
profusion
about
the
favour
spot
where
jasmine
and
ivy
meet
and
marry
them
.
  
<EOS>
doubtless
at
high
noon
,
in
the
broad

vulgar
middle
of
the
day
,
when
Madame
Beck

turn
out
rampant

,
vie
with
the

in
the
brazen
exercise

doubtless

_
<EOS>
then

<EOS>
the

at
sunset
or
the
hour
of
_

,
when
the

home

and
the
boarder
quiet
at

pleasant
be
it
then
to
stray
down
the
peaceful
alley
,
and
hear
the
bell
of
St.
Jean

peal
out
with
their

soft

I
be

thus
one
evening

be
detain
farther

twilight

by
the

<EOS>
I
see
by
a

gather
to
evening
prayer
 
<EOS>
a

the

in

by

a
long

<EOS>
this

certain

an
alley

run
parallel
with
the
very
high
wall
on
that
side
the
garden

be
forbid
to
be

by
the
pupil

<EOS>
It
be
call
indeed
"

and
any

set
foot
there
would
have
render
herself
liable
to
as
severe
a
penalty
as
the
mild
rule
of
Madame
Beck
's
establishment
permit
.
<EOS>
teacher
may
indeed
go
there
with
impunity
;
but
as
the
walk
be
narrow
,
and
the
neglect
shrub
be
grow
very
thick
and
close
on
each
side
,
weave
overhead
a
roof
of

in

this
alley
be
seldom

even
during

and
after
dusk
be
carefully
shun
.
  
<EOS>
from
the
first
I
be
tempt
to
make
an
exception
to
this
rule
of
avoidance
:
the
seclusion
,
the
very
gloom
of
the
walk
attract
me
.
<EOS>
for
a
long
time
the
fear
of
seem
singular
scare
me
away
;
but
by
degree
,
as
people
become
accustomed
to
me
and
my
habit
,
and
to
such
shade
of
peculiarity
as
be
engraine
in
my
nature
 
shade
,
certainly
not
strike
enough
to
interest
,
and
perhaps
not
prominent
enough
to
offend
,
but
bear
in
and
with
me
,
and
no
more
to
be
part
with
than
my
identity
 
by
slow
degree
<EOS>
I
become
a
frequenter
of
this
strait
and
narrow
path
.
<EOS>
I
make
myself
gardener
of
some
tintless
flower
that
grow
between
its
closely
-
rank
shrub
;
I
clear
away
the
relic
of
past
autumn
,
choke
up
a
rustic
seat
at
the
far
end
.
<EOS>
borrowing
of
Goton
,
the
cuisinière
,
a
pail
of
water
and
a
scrubbing

brush
,
I
make
this
seat
clean
.
<EOS>
Madame

me
at
work
and

approbation
:
whether
sincerely

I
do
not

sincere

much
as
I

that
as
I

I

to

only
I

to

English
with

<EOS>
on
the
night
in
question
,
I
be
sit
on
the
hidden
seat
reclaim
from
fungi
and
mould
,
listen
to
what
seem
the
far
-
off
sound
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
far
off
,
in
truth
,
they
be
not
:
this
school
be
in
the
city
's
centre
;
hence
,
it
be
but
five
minute
'
walk
to
the
park
,
scarce
ten
to
building
of
palatial
splendour
.
<EOS>
quite
near
be
wide
street
brightly
light
,
teem
at
this
moment
with
life
:
carriage
be
roll
through
them
to
ball
or
to
the
opera
.
<EOS>
the
same
hour
which
toll
curfew
for
our
convent
,
which
extinguish
each
lamp
,
and
drop
the
curtain
round
each
couch
,
ring
for
the
gay
city
about
us
the
summon
to
festal
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
of
this
contrast
I
think
not
,
however
:
gay
instinct
my
nature
have
few
;
ball
or
opera
I
have
never
see
;
and
though
often
I
have
hear
them
describe
,
and
even
wish
to
see
them
,
it
be
not
the
wish
of
one
who
hope
to
partake
a
pleasure
if
she
could
only
reach
it
 
who
feel
fit
to
shine
in
some
bright
distant
sphere
<EOS>
,
could
she
but
thither
win
her
way
;
it
be
no
yearning
to
attain
,
no
hunger
to
taste
;
only
the
calm
desire
to
look
on
a
new
thing
.
  
<EOS>
a
moon
be
in
the
sky
,
not
a
full
moon
,
but
a
young
crescent
.
<EOS>
I
see
her
through
a
space
in
the
bough
overhead
.
<EOS>
She
and
the
star
,
visible
beside
her
,
be
no
stranger
where
all
else
be
strange
:
my
childhood
know
them
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
that
golden
sign
with
the
dark
globe
in
its
curve
lean
back
on
azure
,
beside
an
old
thorn
at
the
top
of
an
old
field
,
in
Old
England
,
in
long
past
day
,
just
as
it
now
lean
back
beside
a
stately
spire
in
this
continental
capital
.
  
<EOS>
oh
,
my
childhood
!
<EOS>
I
have
feeling
:
passive
as
I
live
,
little
as
I
speak
,
cold
as
I
look
,
when
I
think
of
past
day
,
I
_
could
_
feel
.
<EOS>
about
the
present
,
it
be
well
to
be
stoical
;
about
the
future
 
such
a
future
as
mine
 
to
be
dead
.
<EOS>
and
in
catalepsy
and
a
dead
trance
,
I
studiously
hold
the
quick
of
my
nature
.
  
<EOS>
at
that
time
,
I
well
remember
whatever
could
excite
 
certain
accident
of
the
weather
,
for
instance
,
be
almost
dread
by
me
,
because
they
wake
the
being
I
be
always
lull
,
and
stir
up
a
craving
cry
I
could
not
satisfy
.
<EOS>
one
night
a
thunder
-
storm
break
;
a
sort
of
hurricane
shake
us
in
our
bed
:
the
Catholics
rise
in
panic
and
pray
to
their
saint
.
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
the
temp
take
hold
of
me
with
tyranny
:
I
be
roughly
rouse
and
oblige
to
live
.
<EOS>
I
get
up
and
dress
myself
,
and
creep
outside
the
casement
close
by
my
bed
,
sit
on
its
ledge
,
with
my
foot
on
the
roof
of
a
lower
adjoining
building
.
<EOS>
It
be
wet
,
it
be
wild
,
it
be
pitch
-
dark
.
<EOS>
within
the
dormitory
they
gather
round
the
night
-
lamp
in
consternation
,
pray
loud
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
go
in
:
too
resistless
be
the
delight
of
stay
with
the
wild
hour
,
black
and
full
of
thunder
,
peal
out
such
an
ode
as
language
never
deliver
to
man
 
too
terribly
glorious
,
the
spectacle
of
cloud
,
split
and
pierce
by
white
and
blind
bolt
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
long
,
achingly
,
then
and
for
four
and
twenty
hour
afterwards
,
for
something
to
fetch
me
out
of
my
present
existence
,
and
lead
me
upwards
and
onwards
.
<EOS>
this
longing
,
and
all
of
a
similar
kind
,
it
be
necessary
to
knock
on
the
head
;
which
I
do
,
figuratively
,
after
the
manner
of
Jael
to
Sisera
,
drive
a
nail
through
their
temple
.
<EOS>
unlike
Sisera
,
they
do
not
die
:
they
be
but
transiently
stunned
,
and
at
interval
would
turn
on
the
nail
with
a
rebellious
wrench
:
then
do
the
temple
bleed
,
and
the
brain
thrill
to
its
core
.
  
<EOS>
to
-
night
,
I
be
not
so
mutinous
,
nor
so
miserable
.
<EOS>
My
Sisera
lie
quiet
in
the
tent
,
slumber
;
and
if
his
pain
ache
through
his
slumber
,
something
like
an
angel
 
<EOS>
the
ideal
 
knelt
near
,
drop
balm
on
the
soothe
temple
,
hold
before
the
seal
eye
a
magic
glass
,
of
which
the
sweet
,
solemn
vision
be
repeat
in
dream
,
and
shed
a
reflex
from
her
moonlight
wing
and
robe
over
the
transfix
sleeper
,
over
the
tent
threshold
,
over
all
the
landscape
lie
without
.
<EOS>
Jael
,
the
stern
woman
;
sit
apart
,
relent
somewhat
over
her
captive
;
but
more
prone
to
dwell
on
the
faithful
expectation
of
Heber
come
home
.
<EOS>
by
which
word
<EOS>
I
mean
that
the
cool
peace
and
dewy
sweetness
of
the
night
fill
me
with
a
mood
of
hope
:
not
hope
on
any
definite
point
,
but
a
general
sense
of
encouragement
and
heart
-
ease
.
  
<EOS>
Should
not
such
a
mood
,
so
sweet
,
so
tranquil
,
so
unwonted
,
have
be
the
harbinger
of
good
?
<EOS>
alas
,
no
good
come
of
it
!
<EOS>
I
presently
the
rude
real
burst
coarsely
in
 
all
evil
grovelling
and
repellent
as
she
too
often
be
.
  
<EOS>
amid
the
intense
stillness
of
that
pile
of
stone
overlook
the
walk
,
the
tree
,
the
high
wall
,
I
hear
a
sound
;
a
casement
[
all
the
window
here
be
casement
,
open
on
hinge
]
creak
.
<EOS>
Ere
I
have
time
to
look
up
and
mark
where
,
in
which
story
,
or
by
whom
unclosed
,
a
tree
overhead
shake
,
as
if
strike
by
a
missile
;
some
object
drop
prone
at
my
foot
.
  
<EOS>
nine
be
strike
by
St.
Jean

clock
;
day
be
fade
,
but
it
be
not
dark
:
the
crescent
moon
aid
little
,
but
the
deep
gilding
of
that
point
in
heaven
where
the
sun
beam
last
,
and
the
crystalline
clearness
of
a
wide
space
above
,
sustain
the
summer
twilight
;
even
in
my
dark
walk
I
could
,
by
approach
an
opening
,
have
manage
to
read
print
of
a
small
type
.
<EOS>
Easy
be
it
to
see
then
that
the
missile
be
a
box
,
a
small
box
of
white
and
coloured
ivory
;
its
loose
lid
open
in
my
hand
;
violet
lie
within
,
violet
smother
a
closely

be
it

at
this
moment

I

it

<EOS>
suitor

my

<EOS>
all

into

hope
which
such
prospect
open
,
my
speculation
,
far
less
my
presumption
,
have
never
once
have
warrant
to
intrude
.
<EOS>
if
the
other
teacher
go
into
town
,
or
take
a
walk
on
the
boulevard
,
or
only
attend
mass
,
they
be
very
certain
(
accord
to
the
account
bring
back
)
to
meet
with
some
individual
of
the
"
opposite
sex
,
"
whose
rapt
,
earnest
gaze
assure
them
of
their
power
to
strike
and
to
attract
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
my
experience
tally
with
theirs
,
in
this
respect
.
<EOS>
I
go
to
church
<EOS>
and
I
take
walk
,
and
be
very
well
convinced
that
nobody
mind
me
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
girl
or
woman
in
the
Rue
Fossette
who
could
not
,
and
do
not
testify
to
have
receive
an
admire
beam
from
our
young
doctor
's
blue
eye
at
one
time
or
other
.
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
,
however
humble
it
may
sound
,
to
except
myself
:
as
far
as
I
be
concern
,
those
blue
eye
be
guiltless
,
and
calm
as
the
sky
,
to
whose
tint
theirs
seem
akin
.
<EOS>
so
it
come
to
pass
that
I
hear
the
other
talk
,
wonder
often
at
their
gaiety
,
security
,
and
self
-
satisfaction
,
but
do
not
trouble
myself
to
look
up
and
gaze
along
the
path
<EOS>
they
seem
so
certain
of
tread
.
<EOS>
this
then
be
no
billet
-
doux
;
and
it
be
in
settle
conviction
to
the
contrary
that
I
quietly
open
it
.
<EOS>
thus
it
run
 
<EOS>
I
translate
:

<EOS>
how
tremblingly
I
approach

an

the
wish
bear
even
close
reference

the

address
in

than
to

<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
from
the

one
of
the
engaged
pupil
;
and
,
in
that
case
,
there
be
no
great
harm
do

intend

a

irregularity

<EOS>
several

"

surely

the

common
to

<EOS>
the
grey
dress
hardly
give
more
definite
indication
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
herself
ordinarily
wear
a
grey
dress
just
now
;
another
teacher
,
and
three
of
the
pensionnaire
,
have
have
grey
dress
purchase
of
the

shade

fabric
as
mine
:
it
be
a

which
happen
at

<EOS>
meanwhile

as
I

I

I

<EOS>
light

move

<EOS>
another

<EOS>
the

stand
open

into

the
coolness

from

<EOS>
all
at

quick

quick

not

Rosine
dart
from

the

lift

look

"
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
pass

"
plead
a
voice
I
know

"
I
ask

five
minute
;
"
and
a
familiar
shape
,
tall
and
grand
(
as
we
of
the
Rue
Fossette
all
think
it
)
,
issue
from
the
house
,
and
strode
down
amongst
the
bed
and
walk
.
<EOS>
It
be
sacrilege
 
the
intrusion
of
a
man
into
that
spot
,
at
that
hour
;
but
he
know
himself
privilege
,
and
perhaps
he
trust
to
the
friendly
night
.
<EOS>
He
wander
down
the
alley
,
look
on
this
side
and
<EOS>
on
that
 
he
be
lose
in
the
shrub
,
trample
flower
and
break
branch
in
his
search
 
<EOS>
he
penetrate
at
last
the
"
forbidden
walk
.
<EOS>
"
there
I
meet
him
,
like
some
ghost
,
I
suppose
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dr.
John
!
<EOS>
it
be
find
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
ask
by
whom
,
for
with
his
quick
eye
he
perceive
that
I
hold
it
in
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
betray
her
,
"
he
say
,
look
at
me
as
if
I
be
indeed
a
dragon
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
I
ever
so
disposed
to
treachery
,
I
can
not
betray
what
I
do
not
know
,
"
be
my
answer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
read
the
note
,
and
you
will
see
how
little
it
reveal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
have
read
it
,
"
I
think
to
myself
;
and
yet
I
could
not
believe
he
write
it
:
that
could
hardly
be
his
style
<EOS>
:
besides
,
I
be
fool
enough
to
think
there
would
be
a
degree
of
hardship
in
his
call
me
such
name
.
<EOS>
His
own
look
vindicate
him
;
he
grow
hot
,
and
colour
as
he
read
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
indeed
too
much
:
<EOS>
this
be
cruel
,
this
be
humiliating
,
"
be
the
word
that
fall
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
it
_
be
_
cruel
,
when
I
see
his
countenance
so
move
.
<EOS>
no
matter
whether
he
be
to
blame
or
not
<EOS>
;
somebody
,
it
seem
to
me
,
must
be
more
to
blame
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
shall
you
do
about
it
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquire
of
me
.
"
<EOS>
Shall
you
tell
Madame
Beck
what
you
have
find
,
and
cause
a
stir
 
an
esclandre
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
I
ought
to
tell
,
and
say
so
;
add
that
I
do
not
believe
there
would
be
either
stir
or
esclandre
:
Madame
be
much
too
prudent
to
make
a
noise
about
an
affair
of
that
sort
connected
with
her
establishment
.
  
<EOS>
He
stand
look
down
and
meditate
.
<EOS>
He
be
both
too
proud
and
too
honourable
to
entreat
my
secresy
on
a
point
which
duty
evidently
command
me
to
communicate
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
do
right
,
yet
loathe
to
grieve
or
injure
him
.
<EOS>
just
then
Rosine
glance
out
through
the
open
door
;
she
could
not
see
us
,
though
between
the
tree
<EOS>
I
could
plainly
see
her
:
<EOS>
her
dress
be
grey
,
like
mine
.
<EOS>
this
circumstance
,
take
in
connection
with
prior
transaction
,
suggest
to
me
that
perhaps
the
case
,
however
deplorable
,
be
one
in
which
I
be
under
no
obligation
whatever
to
concern
myself
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
I
say
,
 
"
if
you
can
assure
me
that
none
of
Madame
Beck

pupil

I
shall
be
very
happy
to
stand
aloof
from
all
interference

<EOS>
take
the
casket
,
the
bouquet
,
and
the
billet
;
for
my
part
,
I
gladly
forget
the
whole
affair

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
look
there
!
"
<EOS>
he
whisper
suddenly
,
as
his
hand
close
on
what
I
offer
,
and
at
the
same
time
he
point
through
the
bough
.
  
<EOS>
I
look
.
<EOS>
Behold
Madame
,
in
shawl
,
wrapping

gown
,
and
slipper
,
softly
descend
the
step
,
and
steal
like
a
cat
round
the
garden
<EOS>
:
in
two
minute
she
would
have
be
upon
Dr.
John

<EOS>
if
_
<EOS>
she

be
like

however

quite

nothing
could

<EOS>
He
watch
,
and
as
she
turn
a
corner

he
take
the
garden

noiseless

<EOS>
She
reappear

and
he
be

<EOS>
Rosine
help
him

instantly
interpose
the
door
between
him
and
his
huntress
.
<EOS>
I
,
too

may
have
get

away

but
I
prefer
to

Madame
openly

<EOS>

<EOS>
full

<EOS>
I

reprimand

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
Madame
be
all
goodness

<EOS>
She
tender
not
even
a
remonstrance
;
she
testify
no
shade
of
surprise

<EOS>
with
that
consummate
tact
of
hers
,
in
which
I
believe
she
be

she

<EOS>
and
,
instead
of
send
me
in

she
detain
me
to
take
a
few
turn
with
her
down
the
principal
alley

<EOS>
when
at

we

<EOS>
from

doubtless

<EOS>
finely
accomplished

it

<EOS>
with

I

my

while

the

be
always
the

,
a
much
small

<EOS>
two

<EOS>

I
soon
find

mainly
design
as
a

a

such
a

digest
at

<EOS>
the

bring
out
(
it

when
finish

recommence
)
be
a
venerable
volume
,
old
as

grey

<EOS>
I
would
have
give
two
franc

the
chance
of
get
that
book
once
into
my

turn
over
the
sacred
yellow
leave

ascertain
the
title
,
and
peruse
with
my

the
enormous
figment
which
,
as
an
unworthy
heretic

it

permit
me
to

<EOS>
this

contain
legend
of
the
saint
.
<EOS>
good
God
!
<EOS>
(
I
speak
the
word
reverently
)
<EOS>
what
legend
they
be
.
<EOS>
what
gasconade
rascal
those
saint

have
be
,
if
they
first
boast
these
exploit
or
invent
these
miracle

<EOS>
these
legend
,
however
,
be
no
more
than
monkish
extravagance
,
over
which
one
laugh
inwardly
;
there
be
,
besides
,
priestly
matter
,
and
the
priestcraft
of
the
book
be
far
bad
than
its
monkery
.
<EOS>
the
ear
burn
on
each
side
of
my
head
as
I
listen
,
perforce
,
to
tale
of
moral
martyrdom
inflict
by
Rome
;
the
dread
boast
of
confessor
,
who
have
wickedly
abuse
their
office
,
trample
to
deep
degradation
high
-
bear
lady

make
of
countess

princesse
the
most

slave

<EOS>
story
like
that
of
Conrad

Elizabeth

Hungary
,
recur
again
and
again
,
with
all
its
dreadful
viciousness
,
sickening
tyranny
and
black
impiety
:
tale
that
be
nightmare
of
oppression
,
privation
,
and
agony
.
  
<EOS>
I
sit
out
this
"

"
for
some
night
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
as
quietly
too
;
only
once
break
off
the
point
of
my
scissor
by
involuntarily
stick
them
somewhat
deep
in
the
worm
-
eat
board

<EOS>
but
,
at

it
make
me
so
burn
hot
,
and
my
temple
,
and
my
heart
,
and
my
wrist
throb
so
fast
,
and
my
sleep
afterwards
be
so
break
with
excitement
,
that
I
could
sit
no
longer
.
<EOS>
prudence
recommend
henceforward
a
swift
clearance
of
my
person
from
the
place
,
the
moment
that
guilty
old
book
be
bring
out
.
<EOS>
no
Mause

ever
feel
a
strong
call
to
take
up
her
testimony

than
I

speak
my
mind
in
this
matter
of
the
popish
"

"
<EOS>
however
,
I
do
manage
somehow
to
curb
and
rein
in
;
and
though
always
,
as
soon
as
Rosine
come
to
light
the
lamp
,
I
shoot
from
the
room
quickly
,
yet
also
I
do
it
quietly
;
seize
that
vantage
moment
give
by
the
little
bustle
before
the
dead
silence
,
and
vanish
whilst
the
boarder
put
their
book
away
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
vanish
 
it
be
into
darkness
;
candle
be
not
allow
to
be
carry
about
,
and
the
teacher
who
forsook
the
refectory
,
have
only
the
unlit
hall
,
schoolroom
,
or
bedroom
,
as
a
refuge
.
<EOS>
in
winter
I
seek
the
long
class
,
and
pace
them
fast
to
keep
myself
warm
 
fortunate
if
the
moon
shine
,
and
if
there
be
only
star
,
soon
reconcile
to
their
dim
gleam
,
or
even
to
the
total
eclipse
of
their
absence
.
<EOS>
in
summer
it
be
never
quite
dark
,
and
then
I
go
up

stair
to
my
own
quarter
of
the
long
dormitory
,
open
my
own
casement
<EOS>
(
that
chamber
be
light
by
five
casement
large
as

,
and
lean
out
,
look
forth
upon
the
city
beyond
the
garden
,
and
listen
to
band

music
from
the
park

think

my

live
my

<EOS>
this
evening
,
fugitive
as
usual
before
the
Pope
and
his
work
,
I
mount
the
staircase
,
approach
the
dormitory
,
and
quietly
open
the
door
,
which
be
always
keep
carefully
shut
,
and
which

like
every
other

revolve
noiselessly
on

<EOS>
before
I
_
see

,
I
_
feel
_
<EOS>
that
life
be
in
the
great
room
,
usually
void
:
not
that
there
be
either
stir
or
breath
,
or
rustle
of
sound

but
Vacuum
lack

Solitude
be
not

<EOS>
all
the
white
bed
 
the
"

"
as
they
be
poetically
term
 
lie
visible
at
a

;
all
be
empty
:
no

therein

<EOS>
the
sound
of
a
drawer
cautiously
slide
out
strike
my
ear
;
step
a
little
to
one
side
,
my
vision
take
a
free
range
,
unimpede
by
fall
curtain
.
<EOS>
I
now
command
my
own
bed
and
my
own
toilet
,
with
a
lock
work

box
upon
it

and
lock

<EOS>
very

stand

<EOS>
Open

open
the

duly

impartially
<EOS>
be

drawer

in

not

not

<EOS>
Madame
work

I
will
not
deny
that
it
be
with
a
secret
glee
I
watch
her
.
<EOS>
have
I
be
a
gentleman
<EOS>
I
believe
Madame
would
have
find
favour
in
my
eye

she
be
so
handy

neat
,
<EOS>
thorough
in
all
<EOS>
she
do
:
some
people

movement
provoke
the
soul
by
their
loose
awkwardness
,
her
 
satisfied
by
their
trim
compactness
.
<EOS>
I
stand
,
in
short
,
fascinated
;
but
it
be
necessary
to
make
an
effort
to
break
this
spell
a
retreat
must
be
beat
.
<EOS>
the
searcher
may
have
turn
and
catch
me
;
there
would
have
be
nothing
for
it
then
but
a
scene
,
and
she
and
I
would
have
have
to
come
all
at
once
,
with
a
sudden
clash
,
to
a
thorough
knowledge
of
each
other
:
down
would
have
go
conventionality
,
away
sweep
disguise
,
and
_
I
_
should
have
look
into
her
eye
,
and
she
into
mine
 
<EOS>
we
should
have
know
that
we
could
work
together
no
more
,
and
part
in
this
life
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
where
be
the
use
of
tempt
such
a
catastrophe
?
<EOS>
I
be
not
angry
,
and
have
no
wish
in
the
world
to
leave
her
.
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
get
another
employer
whose
yoke
would
be
so
light
and
so
,
easy
of
carriage
;
and
truly
I
like
Madame
for
her
capital
sense
,
whatever
I
may
think
of
her
principle
:
<EOS>
as
to
her
system
,
it
do
me
no
harm
;
she
may
work
me
with
it
to
her
heart
's
content
:
<EOS>
nothing
would
come
of
the
operation
.
<EOS>
loverless
and
inexpectant
of
love
,
I
be
as
safe
from
spy
in
my
heart
-
poverty
,
as
the
beggar
from
thief
in
his
destitution
of
purse
.
<EOS>
I
turn
,
then
,
and
flee
;
descend
the
stair
with
progress
as
swift
and
soundless
as
that
of
the
spider
,
which
at
the
same
instant
run
down
the
bannister
.
  
<EOS>
how
I
laugh
when
I
reach
the
schoolroom
.
<EOS>
I
know
now
she
have
certainly
see
Dr.
John
in
the
garden
;
I
know
what
her
thought
be
.
<EOS>
the
spectacle
of
a
suspicious
nature
so
far
mislead
by
its
own
invention
,
tickle
me
much
.
<EOS>
yet
as
the
laugh
die
,
a
kind
of
wrath
smote
me
,
and
then
bitterness
follow
:
it
be
the
rock
strike
,
and
Meribah
's
water
gush
out
.
<EOS>
I
never
have
feel
so
strange
and
contradictory
an
inward
tumult
as
I
feel
for
an
hour
that
evening
:
soreness
and
laughter
,
and
fire
,
and
grief
,
share
my
heart
between
them
.
<EOS>
I
cry
hot
tear
:
not
because
Madame
mistrust
me
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
twopence
for
her
mistrust
 
but
for
other
reason
.
<EOS>
complicated
,
disquiet
thought
break
up
the
whole
repose
of
my
nature
.
<EOS>
however
,
that
turmoil
subside
:
next
day
I
be
again
Lucy
Snowe
.
  
<EOS>
on
revisit
my
drawer
,
I
find
them
all
securely
lock
;
the
close
subsequent
examination
could
not
discover
change
or
apparent
disturbance
in
the
position
of
one
object
.
<EOS>
My
few
dress
be
fold
as
I
have
leave
them
;
a
certain
little
bunch
of
white
violet
that
have
once
be
silently
present
to
me
by
a
stranger
(
a
stranger
to
me
,
for
we
have
never
exchange
word
)
,
and
which
I
have
dry
and
keep
for
its
sweet
perfume
between
the
fold
of
my
good
dress
,
lie
there
unstirred
;
my
black
silk
scarf
,
my
lace
chemisette
and
collar
,
be
unrumpled

<EOS>
have
she
crease
one
solitary
article
<EOS>
,
I
own
I
should
have
feel
much
great
difficulty
in
forgive
her
;
but
find
all
straight
and
orderly
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
"
let
bygone
be
bygone
.
<EOS>
I
be
unharmed
:
why
should
I
bear
malice
?
"
     
<EOS>
a
thing
there
be
which
puzzle
myself
,
and
I
seek
in
my
brain
a
key
to
that
riddle
almost
as
sedulously
as
Madame
have
seek
a
guide
to
useful
knowledge
in
my
toilet
drawer
.
<EOS>
how
be
it
that
Dr.
John
,
if
he
have
not
be
accessory
to
the
dropping
of
that
casket
into
the
garden
,
should
have
know
that
it
_
be
_
drop
,
and
appear
so
promptly
on
the
spot
to
seek
it
?
<EOS>
so
strong
be
the
wish
to
clear
up
this
point
that
I
begin
to
entertain
this
daring
suggestion
:
<EOS>
"
why
may
I
not
,
in
case
I
should
ever
have
the
opportunity
,
ask
Dr.
John
himself
to
explain
this
coincidence
?
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
long
as
Dr.
John
be
absent
,
I
really
believe
I
have
courage
to
test
him
with
such
a
question
.
  
<EOS>
Little
Georgette
be
now
convalescent
;
and
her
physician
accordingly
make
his
visit
very
rare
:
indeed
,
he
would
have
cease
them
altogether
,
have
not
Madame
insist
on
his
give
an
occasional
call
till
the
child
should
be
quite
well
.
  
<EOS>
She
come
into
the
nursery
one
evening
just
after
I
have
listen
to
Georgette
's
lisped
and
broken
prayer
,
and
have
put
her
to
bed
.
<EOS>
take
the
little
one
's
hand
,
she
say
,
"
cette
enfant
a
toujour
un
peu
de
fièvre
.
"
<EOS>
and
presently
afterwards
,
look
at
me
with
a
quick
glance
than
be
habitual
to
her
quiet
eye
,
"
Le
Docteur
John

<EOS>
Non

"
  
<EOS>
of
course
she
know
this
well
than
any
other
person
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
"
she
continue
,
"
I
be
go
out
,

<EOS>
I
shall
call
on
Dr.
John
,
and
send
him
to
the
child
.
<EOS>
I
will
that
he
see
her
this
evening
;
her
cheek
be
flush
,
her
pulse
be
quick
;
_
you
_
will
receive
him
 
for
my
part
,
I
shall
be
from
home
.
"
  
<EOS>
now
the
child
be
well
enough
,
only
warm
with
the
warmth
of
July
;
it
be
scarcely
less
needful
to
send
for
a
priest
to
administer
extreme
unction
than
for
a
doctor
to
prescribe
a
dose
;
also
Madame
rarely
make
"
course
,
"
as
she
call
them
,
in
the
evening
:
<EOS>
moreover
,
this
be
the
first
time
she
have
choose
to
absent
herself
on
the
occasion
of
a
visit
from
Dr.
John
.
<EOS>
the
whole
arrangement
indicate
some
plan
;
this
I
see
,
but
without
the
least
anxiety
.
"
<EOS>
ha
!
ha
!
<EOS>
Madame
,
"
laugh
light
-
heart
the
Beggar
,
"
your
crafty
wit

on
the
wrong
tack

"
  
<EOS>
She
depart
,
attire
very
smartly
,
in
a
shawl
of
price
,
and
a
certain
_
chapeau
vert
tendre
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
hazardous
,
as
to
its
tint
,
for
any
complexion
less
fresh
than
her
own
,
but
,
to
her
,
not
unbecoming
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
she
intend
:
whether
she
really
would
send
Dr.
John
or
not
;
or
whether
indeed
he
would
come
:
he
may
be
engage
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
have
charge
me
not
to
let
Georgette
sleep

the
doctor
come
;
I
have
therefore
sufficient
occupation
in
tell
her
nursery
tale
and
palaver
the
little
language
for
her
benefit
.
<EOS>
I
affect
Georgette
;
she
be
a
sensitive
and
a
love
child
:
to
hold
her
in
my
lap
,
or
carry
her
in
my
arm
,
be
to
me
a
treat
.
<EOS>
to
-
night
she
would
have
me
lay
my
head
on
the
pillow
of
her
crib
;
she
even
put
her
little
arm
<EOS>
round
my
neck
.
<EOS>
Her
clasp
,
and
the
nestling
action
with
which
she
press
her
cheek
to
mine
,
make
me
almost
cry
with
a
tender
pain
.
<EOS>
feeling
of
no
kind
abound
in
that
house
;
this
pure
little
drop
from
a
pure
little
source
be
too
sweet
:
it
penetrate
deep
,
and
subdue
the
heart
,
and
send
a
gush
to
the
eye
.
<EOS>
half
an
hour
or
an
hour
pass
;
Georgette
murmur
in
her
soft
lisp
that
she
be
grow
sleepy
.
"
<EOS>
and
you
_
shall
_
sleep

I

"

<EOS>
Hark
!
<EOS>
there
be
the
ring

and
there

the

<EOS>
Rosine
introduce
Dr.
John

and
,
with
a
freedom
of
manner
not
altogether
peculiar
to

but
characteristic
of

of
Villette

Madame

"

the

with

some
harmless
prescription

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
continue
Rosine

speak
quite
freely
the

I
should
so
much
have
wish
to
say
,
but
have
no
address
or
courage
to
bring
it
out
<EOS>
:
how
short
some
people
make
the
road
to
a
point
which
,
for

seem
unattainable

<EOS>
"
that

rejoin
Dr.
John
briefly
,

with
no

sort
of

he
seem
quite
to
understand
the
rosine

the

could
not

readily

rejoin
he
;

I
see
him
give
her
a
piece
of
gold
,
which
she
take
unscrupulously
,
and
then
dance
off
to
answer
the

ring
just

every

<EOS>
the
reader
must
not
think
too
hardly
of
Rosine
;
on
the
whole
,
she
be
not
a
bad
sort
of
person
,
and
have
no
idea
there
could
be
any
disgrace
in
grasp
at
whatever
she
could
get
,
or
any
effrontery
in
chatter
like
a
pie
to
the
good
gentleman
in

<EOS>
I
have
learn
something
from
the
above
scene
besides
what
concern
the
ivory
box
:
viz

,
that
not
on
the
robe

pink

grey
,

on
the
frilled
and
pocket
apron

lie
the
blame
of
break
Dr.
John
's
heart
:
these
item
of
array
be
obviously
guiltless
as
Georgette
's
little
blue
tunic
.
<EOS>
so
much
the
well

<EOS>
but
who
then
be
the
culprit
?
<EOS>
what
be
the
ground
 
<EOS>
what
the
origin
 
<EOS>
what
the
perfect
explanation
of
the
whole
business
?
<EOS>
some
point
have
be
clear
,
but
how
many
yet
remain
obscure
as
night
!
  
<EOS>
"
however
,
"
I
say
to
myself
,
"
it
be
no
affair

yours

"
and
turn
from
the
face
on
which
I
have
be
unconsciously
dwell
with
a
questioning
gaze
<EOS>
,
I
look
through
the
window

command
the
garden
below

<EOS>
Dr.
John

meantime
,
stand
by

side

be
slowly
draw
on
his

watch
his
little
patient
,
as

eye
close

her
rosy
lip
part
in

<EOS>
I
wait
till

should
depart

with
a
quick
bow

scarce
articulate
"
good

<EOS>
just
as
he
take
his
hat
,
my
eye
,
fix
on
the
tall
house
bound
the
garden
,
see
the
one
lattice
,
already
commemorate
,
cautiously
open
;
forth
from
the
aperture
project
a
hand
and
a
white
handkerchief
;
both
wave
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
the
signal
be
answer
from
some
viewless
quarter
of
our
own
dwelling
;
but
immediately
after
there
flutter
from
,
the
lattice
a
fall
object
,
white
and
light
 
billet
the
second
,
of
course

<EOS>
"
there

I
ejaculate
involuntarily

,
ask
Dr.

with
energy
,
make
direct
for

window

a
handkerchief
wave
and
something
fall
:

and
I
point
to
the
lattice

now
closed
and
look
hypocritically
blank
.
  
<EOS>
"
go

at
once
;
pick

up

add
,
"
nobody

take
notice

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Straight
I
go
.
<EOS>
after
some
little
search
,
I
find
a
fold
paper
,
lodge
on
the
low
branch
of
a
shrub
;
I
seize
and
bring
it
direct
to
Dr.
John

<EOS>
this
time
,
I
believe
not

see
me

<EOS>
He
instantly
tear
the
billet
into
small
piece
,
without
read
it

<EOS>
"
It

if

excellent

somewhat
inexperienced

<EOS>
"
as

I
ask

<EOS>
"
yes

he
abstractedly
.
<EOS>
"
what
snare
be
round
her
!
"
<EOS>
he
add
,
musingly
:
and
now
,
certainly
for
the
first
time
,
he
examine
my
face
,
anxious
,
doubtless
,
to
see
if
any
kindly
expression
there
,
would
warrant
him
in
recommend
to
my
care
and
indulgence
some
ethereal
creature
,
against
whom
power
of
darkness
be
plot
.
<EOS>
I
feel
no
particular
vocation
to
undertake
the
surveillance
of
ethereal
creature
;
but
recall
the
scene
at
the
bureau
,
it
seem
to
me
that
I
owe
_
him
_
<EOS>
a
good
turn
<EOS>
:
if
I
_
could
_
help
him
<EOS>
then
I
would
,
and
it
lie
not
with
me
to
decide
how
.
<EOS>
with
as
little
reluctance
as
may
be
,
I
intimate
that

I
be
willing

do

<EOS>
"
I
be
no
farther
interested

he

with
a
modesty

admirable

I

to
witness

I
happen
to
be
acquaint
with
the
rather
worthless
character
of
the
person

who
,
from
the
house
opposite

have
now
twice
invade
the
sanctity

Her

It
be
not

busily

in

I
run
over

one
I
find
to
be
an
honest
woman
,
but
a
narrow
thinker
,
a
coarse
feeler
,
and
an
egotist
.
<EOS>
the
second
be
a
Parisienne
,
externally
refine
 
at
heart
,
corrupt
 
without
a
creed
,
without
a
principle
,
without
an
affection
:
have
penetrate
the
outward
crust
of
decorum
in
this
character
,
you
find
a
slough
beneath
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
wonderful
passion
for
present
;
and
,
in
this
point
,
the
third
teacher
 
a
person
otherwise
characterless
and
insignificant
 
closely
resemble
her
.
<EOS>
this
last

name
have
also
one
other
distinctive
property
 
that
of
avarice
.
<EOS>
in
her
reign
the
love
of
money
for
its
own
sake
.
<EOS>
the
sight
of
a
piece
of
gold
would
bring
into
her
eye
a
green
glisten
,
singular
to
witness
.
<EOS>
She
once
,
as
a
mark
of
high
favour
,
take
me
up
-
stair
,
and
,
open
a
secret
door
,
show
me
a
hoard
 
<EOS>
a
mass
of
coarse
,
large
coin
 
about
fifteen
guinea
,
in
five
-
franc
piece
.
<EOS>
She
love
this
hoard
as
a
bird
love
its
egg
.
<EOS>
these
be
her
saving
.
<EOS>
She
would
come
and
talk
to
me
about
them
with
an
infatuated
and
persevere
dotage
,
strange
to
behold
in
a
person
not
yet
twenty
-
five
.
  
<EOS>
the
Parisienne
,
on
the
other
hand
,
be
prodigal
and
profligate
(
in
disposition
,
that
is
:
as
to
action
,
I
do
not
know
)
.
<EOS>
that
latter
quality
show
its
snake
-
head
to
me
but
once
,
peep
out
very
cautiously
.
<EOS>
a
curious
kind
of
reptile
it
seem
,
judge
from
the
glimpse
I
get
;
its
novelty
whet
my
curiosity
:
if
it
would
have
come
out
boldly
,
perhaps
I
may
philosophically
have
stand
my
ground
,
and
coolly
survey
the
long
thing
from
fork
tongue
to
scaly
tail
-
tip
;
but
it
merely
rustle
in
the
leave
of
a
bad
novel
;
and
,
on
encounter
a
hasty
and
ill
-
advise
demonstration
of
wrath
,
recoil
and
vanish
,
hiss
.
<EOS>
She
hate
me
from
that
day
.
  
<EOS>
this
Parisienne
be
always
in
debt
;
her
salary
be
anticipate
,
not
only
in
dress
,
but
in
perfume
,
cosmetic
,
confectionery
,
and
condiment
.
<EOS>
what
a
cold
,
callous
epicure
she
be
in
all
thing
!
<EOS>
I
see
her
now
.
<EOS>
thin
in
face
and
figure
,
sallow
in
complexion
,
regular
in
feature
,
with
perfect
tooth
,
lip
like
a
thread
,
a
large
,
prominent
chin
,
a
well
-
open
,
but
frozen
eye
,
of
light
at
once
crave
and
ingrate
.
<EOS>
She
mortally
hate
work
,
and
love
what
she
call
pleasure
;
be
an
insipid
,
heartless
,
brainless
dissipation
of
time
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
know
this
woman
's
character
perfectly
well
.
<EOS>
She
once
talk
to
me
about
her
,
with
an
odd
mixture
of
discrimination
,
indifference
,
and
antipathy
.
<EOS>
I
ask
why
she
keep
her
in
the
establishment
.
<EOS>
She
answer
plainly
,
"
because
it
suit
her
interest
to
do
so
;
"
and
point
out
a
fact
I
have
already
notice
,
namely
,
that
Mademoiselle
St.
Pierre
possess
,
in
an
almost
unique
degree
,
the
power
of
keep
order
amongst
her
undisciplined
rank
of
scholar
.
<EOS>
a
certain
petrifying
influence
accompany
and
surround
her
:
<EOS>
without
passion
,
noise
,
or
violence
,
she
hold
them
in
check
as
a
breezeless
frost
-
air
may
still
a
brawl
stream
.
<EOS>
She
be
of
little
use
as
far
as
communication
of
knowledge
go
,
but
for
strict
surveillance
and
maintenance
of
rule
she
be
invaluable
.

Madame

<EOS>
A
strange
,
frolicsome
,
noisy
little
world
be
this
school
:
great
pain
be
take
to
hide
chain
with
flower
:
a
subtle
essence
of
Romanism
pervade
every
arrangement
:
large
sensual
indulgence
(
so
to
speak
)
be
permit
by
way
of
counterpoise
to
jealous
spiritual
restraint
.
<EOS>
each
mind
be
be
rear
in
slavery

but
,
to
prevent
reflection
from
dwell
on
this
fact
,
every
pretext
for
physical
recreation
be
seize
and
make
the
most
of
.
<EOS>
there
,
as
elsewhere
,
the
CHURCH
strove
to
bring
up
her
child
robust
in
body
,
feeble
in
soul
,
fat
,
ruddy
,
hale

joyous

unquestioning

<EOS>
"

I

their

<EOS>
a
bargain
,
in
which
every
true
Catholic

himself
a
gainer

<EOS>
Lucifer
just
offer
the

term
:

<EOS>
about
this
time
 
in
the
ripe
glow
of
summer
 
Madame
Beck
's
house
become
as
merry
a
place
as
a
school
could
well
be
.
<EOS>
all
day
long
the
broad
fold
-
door
and
the
two
-
leaved
casement
stand
wide
open
:
settle
sunshine
seem
naturalize
in
the
atmosphere
;
cloud
be
far
off
,
sail
away
beyond
sea
,
resting
,
no
doubt
,
round
island
such
as
England
 
that
dear
land
of
mist
 
but
withdraw
wholly
from
the
drier
continent
.
<EOS>
We
live
far
more
in
the
garden
than
under
a
roof
:
class
be
hold
,
and
meal
partaken
of
,
in
the
"
grand
berceau
.
"
<EOS>
moreover
,
there
be
a
note
of
holiday
preparation
,
which
almost
turn
freedom
into
licence
.
<EOS>
the
autumnal
long
vacation
be
but
two
month
distant
;
but
before
that
,
a
great
day
 
an
important
ceremony
 
none
other
than
the
fête
of
Madame
 
await
celebration
.
  
<EOS>
the
conduct
of
this
fête
devolve
chiefly
on
Mademoiselle
St.
Pierre
:
<EOS>
Madame
herself
be
suppose
to
stand
aloof
,
disinterestedly
unconscious
of
what
may
be
go
forward
in
her
honour
.
<EOS>
especially
,
she
never
know
,
never
in
the
least
suspect
,
that
a
subscription
be
annually
levy
on
the
whole
school
for
the
purchase
of
a
handsome
present
.
<EOS>
the
polite
tact
of
the
reader
will
please
to
leave
out
of
the
account
a
brief
,
secret
consultation
on
this
point
in
Madame
's
own
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
will
you
have
this
year
?
"
be
ask
by
her
parisian
lieutenant
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
matter
!
<EOS>
let
it
alone
.
<EOS>
let
the
poor
child
keep
their
franc
,
"
and
Madame
look
benign
and
modest
.
  
<EOS>
the
St.
Pierre
would
here
protrude
her
chin
;
she
know
Madame
by
heart
;
she
always
call
her
air
of
"
bonté
"
 
"
des
grimace
.
<EOS>
"
She
never
even
profess
to
respect
them
one
instant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Vite
!
<EOS>
"
she
would
say
coldly
.
"
<EOS>
name
the
article
.
<EOS>
Shall
it
be
jewellery
or
porcelain
,
haberdashery
or
silver
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
eh
bien
!
<EOS>
Deux
ou
trois
cuillers
,
et
autant
de
fourchette
en
argent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
the
result
be
a
handsome
case
,
contain
300
franc
worth
of
plate
.
  
<EOS>
the
programme
of
the
fête
-
day
's
proceeding
comprise
:
presentation
of
plate
,
collation
in
the
garden
,
dramatic
performance
(
with
pupil
and
teacher
for
actor
)
,
a
dance
and
supper
.
<EOS>
very
gorgeous
seem
the
effect
of
the
whole
to
me
,
as
I
well
remember
.
<EOS>
Zélie
St.
Pierre
understand
these
thing
and
manage
them
ably
.
  
<EOS>
the
play
be
the
main
point
;
a
month
's
previous
drilling
be
there
require
.
<EOS>
the
choice
,
too
,
of
the
actor
require
knowledge
and
care
;
then
come
lesson
in
elocution
,
in
attitude
,
and
then
the
fatigue
of
countless
rehearsal
.
<EOS>
for
all
this
,
as
may
well
be
suppose
,
St.
Pierre
do
not
suffice
:
other
management
,
other
accomplishment
than
her
be
requisite
here
.
<EOS>
They
be
supply
in
the
person
of
a
master
 
M.
Paul
Emanuel
,
professor
of
literature
.
<EOS>
It
be
never
my
lot
to
be
present
at
the
histrionic
lesson
of
M.
Paul
,
but
I
often
see
him
as
he
cross
the
_
carré
_
(
a
square
hall
between
the
dwelling
-
house
and
school
-
house
)
.
<EOS>
I
hear
him
,
too
,
in
the
warm
evening
,
lecture
with
open
door
,
and
his
name
,
with
anecdote
of
him
,
resound
in
one
ear
from
all
side
.
<EOS>
especially
our
former
acquaintance
,
Miss
Ginevra
Fanshawe
,
 
who
have
be
select
to
take
a
prominent
part
in
the
play
 
use
,
in
bestow
upon
me
a
large
portion
of
her
leisure
,
to
lard
her
discourse
with
frequent
allusion
to
his
saying
and
doing
.
<EOS>
She
esteem
him
hideously
plain
,
and
use
to
profess
herself
frighten
almost
into
hysteric
at
the
sound
of
his
step
or
voice
.
<EOS>
a
dark
little
man
he
certainly
be
;
pungent
and
austere
.
<EOS>
even
to
me
he
seem
a
harsh
apparition
,
with
his
close
-
shorn
,
black
head
,
his
broad
,
sallow
brow
,
his
thin
cheek
,
his
wide
and
quiver
nostril
,
his
thorough
glance
,
and
hurried
bearing
.
<EOS>
irritable
he
be
;
one
hear
that
,
as
he
apostrophize
with
vehemence
the
awkward
squad
under
his
order
.
<EOS>
sometimes
he
would
break
out
on
these
raw
amateur
actresse
with
a
passion
of
impatience
at
their
falseness
of
conception
,
their
coldness
of
emotion
,
their
feebleness
of
delivery
.
<EOS>
"
Ecoutez
!
"
<EOS>
he
would
cry
;
and
then
his
voice
ring
through
the
premise
like
a
trumpet
;
and
when
,
mimic
it
,
come
the
small
pipe
of
a
Ginevra
,
a
Mathilde
,
or
a
Blanche
,
one
understand
why
a
hollow
groan
of
scorn
,
or
a
fierce
hiss
of
rage
,
reward
the
tame
echo
.
  
<EOS>
"
vous'n'ête
<EOS>
donc
que
des
poupées
<EOS>
,
"
I
hear
him
thunder
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>

Moi

qu'il
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Vain
resolve
!
<EOS>
and
when
he
at
last
find
it
_
be
_
vain
,
he
suddenly
break
the
whole
business
down
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
he
have
be
teach
them
a
grand
tragedy
;
he
tear
the
tragedy
in
morsel
,
and
come
next
day
with
a
compact
little
comic
trifle
.
<EOS>
to
this
they
take
more
kindly
;
he
presently
knock
it
all
into
their
smooth
round
pate
.
  
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
St.
Pierre
always
preside
at
M.
Emanuel
's
lesson
,
and
I
be
tell
that
the
polish
of
her
manner
,
her
seem
attention
,
her
tact
and
grace
,
impress
that
gentleman
very
favourably
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
indeed
,
the
art
of
pleasing
,
for
a
give
time
,
whom
she
would
;
but
the
feeling
would
not
last
:
in
an
hour
it
be
dry
like
dew
,
vanish
like
gossamer
.
  
<EOS>
the
day
precede
Madame
's
fête
be
as
much
a
holiday
as
the
fête
itself
.
<EOS>
It
be
devoted
to
clear
out
,
clean
,
arrange
and
decorate
the
three
schoolroom
.
<EOS>
all
within
-
door
be
the
gay
bustle
;
neither
up
-
stair
nor
down
could
a
quiet
,
isolated
person
find
rest
for
the
sole
of
her
foot
;
accordingly
,
for
my
part
,
I
take
refuge
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
the
whole
day
do
I
wander
or
sit
there
alone
,
find
warmth
in
the
sun
,
shelter
among
the
tree
,
and
a
sort
of
companionship
in
my
own
thought
.
<EOS>
I
well
remember
that
I
exchange
but
two
sentence
that
day
with
any
live
being
:
not
that
I
feel
solitary
;
I
be
glad
to
be
quiet
.
<EOS>
for
a
looker
-
on
,
it
suffice
to
pass
through
the
room
once
or
twice
,
observe
what
change
be
be
work
,
how
a
green
-
room
and
a
dressing
-
room
be
be
contrive
,
a
little
stage
with
scenery
erect
,
how
M.
Paul
Emanuel
,
in
conjunction
with
Mademoiselle
St.
Pierre
,
be
direct
all
,
and
how
an
eager
band
of
pupil
,
amongst
them
Ginevra
Fanshawe
,
be
work
gaily
under
his
control
.
  
<EOS>
the
great
day
arrive
.
<EOS>
the
sun
rise
hot
and
unclouded
,
and
hot
and
uncloude
it
burn
on
till
evening
.
<EOS>
all
the
door
and
all
the
window
be
set
open
,
which
give
a
pleasant
sense
of
summer
freedom
 
and
freedom
<EOS>
the
most
complete
seem
indeed
the
order
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
teacher
and
pupil
descend
to
breakfast
in
dressing
-
gown
and
curl
-
paper
:
anticipate
"
avec
délice
"
the
toilette
of
the
evening
,
they
seem
to
take
a
pleasure
in
indulge
that
forenoon
in
a
luxury
of
slovenliness
;
like
alderman
fast
in
preparation
for
a
feast
.
<EOS>
about
nine
o'clock
A.M.
,
an
important
functionary
,
the
"
coiffeur
,
"
arrive
.
<EOS>
sacrilegious
to
state
,
he
fix
his
head
-
quarter
in
the
oratory
,
and
there
,
in
presence
of
_
bénitier
_
,
candle
,
and
crucifix
,
solemnise
the
mystery
of
his
art
.
<EOS>
each
girl
be
summon
in
turn
to
pass
through
his
hand
;
emerge
from
them
with
head
as
smooth
as
a
shell
,
intersect
by
faultless
white
line
,
and
wreathe
about
with
grecian
plait
that
shine
as
if
lacquer
.
<EOS>
I
take
my
turn
with
the
rest
,
and
could
hardly
believe
what
the
glass
say
when
I
apply
to
it
for
information
afterwards
;
the
lavish
garlandry
of
weave
brown
hair
amaze
me
 
<EOS>
I
fear
it
be
not
all
my
own
,
and

<EOS>
I
then
acknowledge
in

curiously
elaborate

to
me
it
be
,
and
ever
must
be
an
enigma

how
they
contrive
to
spend
so
much
time
in
do
so
little

<EOS>
the
operation
seem
close

intricate

prolong
:
the
result
simple

<EOS>
a
clear

to
the

whereof

but
though

it

<EOS>
in

this
diaphanous

I
well
remember
feel
myself
to
be

shadowy
spot
on
a
field
of
light

the
courage
be
not

me
to
put
on
a
transparent
white
dress
:
something
thin
I
must
wear
 
the
weather
and
room
be
too
hot
to
give
substantial

sufferance

so
I
have
seek
through

My

have
kindly
make

it
be

more
imperative

well
<EOS>
she
take
this
view

the

for
I

have
no

no

relieve
it

<EOS>
and
,
what
be
more

I
have
no

<EOS>
We
become
oblivious

their

shine

<EOS>
however
,
in

I

at

I

not

Madame

keep
me

she

bright

<EOS>
We
chance
to

she

me
a

<EOS>
not

my
good
,
the
reader
must
remember
,
and
therefore
a
legitimate
object
of
care
)
fastidiously
around
me
,
ascend
this
species
of
extempore
throne
,
and
be
seat
,
commence
the
acquisition
of
my
task
;
while
I
learn
,
not
forget
to
keep
a
sharp
look
-
out
on
the
black
-
beetle
and
cockroach
,
of
which
,
more
even
,
I
believe
,
than
of
the
rat
,
I
sit
in
mortal
dread
.
  
<EOS>
My
impression
at
first
be
that
I
have
undertake
what
it
really
be
impossible
to
perform
,
and
I
simply
resolve
to
do
my
good
and
be
resign
to
fail
.
<EOS>
I
soon
find
,
however
,
that
one
part
in
so
short
a
piece
be
not
more
than
memory
could
master
at
a
few
hour
'
notice
.
<EOS>
I
learn
and
learn
on
,
first
in
a
whisper
,
and
then
aloud
.
<EOS>
perfectly
secure
from
human
audience
,
I
act
my
part
before
the
garret
-
vermin
.
<EOS>
enter
into
its
emptiness
,
frivolity
,
and
falsehood
,
with
a
spirit
inspire
by
scorn
and
impatience
,
I
take
my
revenge
on
this
"
fat
,
"
by
make
him
as
fatuitous
as
I
possibly
could
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
exercise
the
afternoon
pass
:
day
begin
to
glide
into
evening
;
and
I
,
who
have
eat
nothing
since
breakfast
,
grow
excessively
hungry
.
<EOS>
now
I
think
of
the
collation
,
which
doubtless
they
be
just
then
devour
in
the
garden
far
below
.
<EOS>
(
I
have
see
in
the
vestibule
a
basketful
of
small
_
pâtés
à
la
crême
<EOS>
_
,
than
which
nothing
in
the
whole
range
of
cookery
seem
to
me
better
)
.
<EOS>
a
_
pâté
_
,
or
a
square
of
cake
<EOS>
,
it
seem
to
me
would
come
very
_
àpropos
;
_
<EOS>
and
as
my
relish
for
those
dainty
increase
,
it
begin
to
appear
somewhat
hard
that
I
should
pass
my
holiday
,
fast
and
in
prison
.
<EOS>
remote
as
be
the
attic
from
the
street
-
door
and
vestibule
,
yet
the
ever
-
tinkle
bell
be
faintly
audible
here
;
and
also
the
ceaseless
roll
of
wheel
,
on
the
torment
pavement
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
the
house
and
garden
be
throng
,
and
that
all
be
gay
and
glad
below
;
here
it
begin
to
grow
dusk
:
the
beetle
be
fade
from
my
sight
;
I
tremble
lest
they
should
steal
on
me
a
march
,
mount
my
throne
unseen
,
and
,
unsuspected
,
invade
my
skirt
.
<EOS>
impatient
and
apprehensive
<EOS>
,
I
recommence
the
rehearsal
of
my
part
merely
to
kill
time
.
<EOS>
just
as
I
be
conclude
,
the
long
-
delay
rattle
of
the
key
in
the
lock
come
to
my
ear
 
no
unwelcome
sound
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
<EOS>
(
I
could
just
see
through
the
dusk
that
it
_
be
_
M.
Paul
,
for
light
enough
still
linger
to
show
the
velvet
blackness
of
his
close
-
shorn
head
,
and
the
sallow
ivory
of
his
brow
)
look
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
Brava
!
"
<EOS>
cry
he
,
hold
the
door
open
and
remain
at
the
threshold
.
"
<EOS>
j'ai
tout

<EOS>
C'est
assez
bien

<EOS>
encore

"
  
<EOS>
a
moment
I
hesitate
.
  
<EOS>
"
Encore

"
say
he
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
et
point

<EOS>
a

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
again
I
go
through
the
part
,
but
not
half
so
well
as
I
have
speak
it
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Enfin
,
elle
sait
,
"
say
he
,
half
dissatisfied
,
"
and
one
can
not
be
fastidious
or
exact
under
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
"
then
he
add
,
"
You
may
yet
have
twenty
minute
for
preparation
:
au
revoir
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
,
"
I
call
out
,
take
courage
.
  
<EOS>
"
eh
bien

<EOS>
Qu'est

Mademoiselle

<EOS>
et
la

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
it
,
shut
up
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
c'
vrai
,
"
cry
he
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
moment
my
throne
be
abdicate
,
the
attic
evacuate
;
an
inverse
repetition
of
the
impetus
which
have
bring
me
up
into
the
attic
,
instantly
take
me
down
 
down
 
down
to
the
very
kitchen
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
should
have
go
to
the
cellar
.
<EOS>
the
cook
be
imperatively
order
to
produce
food
,
and
I
,
as
imperatively
,
be
command
to
eat
.
<EOS>
to
my
great
joy
this
food
be
limit
to
coffee
and
cake
:
I
have
fear
wine
and
sweet
,
which
I
do
not
like
.
<EOS>
how
he
guess
that
I
should
like
a
_
petit
pâté
<EOS>
à
la
crême
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
;
but
he
go
out
and
procure
me
one
from
some
quarter
.
<EOS>
with
considerable
willingness
I
eat
and
drank
,
keep
the
_
petit
pâté
_
till
the
last
,
as
a
_
bonne
bouche
_
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
superintend
my
repast
,
and
almost
force
upon
me
more
than
I
could
swallow
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
la
bonne
heure
,
"
he
cry
,
when
I
signify
that
I
really
could
take
no
more
,
and
,
with
uplifted
hand
,
implore
to
be
spare
the
additional
roll
on
which
he
have
just
spread
butter
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
set
me
down
as
a
species
of
tyrant
and
Bluebeard
,
starve
woman
in
a
garret
;
whereas
,
after
all
,
I
be
no
such
thing

<EOS>
now
,
Mademoiselle
,
do
you
feel
courage
and
strength
to
appear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
think
I
do
;
though
,
in
truth
,
I
be
perfectly
confused
,
and
could
hardly
tell
how
I
feel
:
but
this
little
man
be
of
the
order
of
being
who
must
not
be
oppose
,
unless
you
possess
an
all

dominant
force
sufficient
to
crush
him
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
then
,
"
say
he
,
offer
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
I
give
him
mine
,
and
he
set
off
with
a
rapid
walk
,
which
oblige
me
to
run
at
his
side
in
order
to
keep
pace
.
<EOS>
in
the
carré
he
stop
a
moment
:
it
be
light
with
large
lamp
;
the
wide
door
of
the
class
be
open
,
and
so
be
the
equally
wide
garden
-
door
;
orange
-
tree
in
tub
,
and
tall
flower
in
pot
,
ornament
these
portal
on
each
side
;
group
of
lady
and
gentleman
in
evening
-
dress
stand
and
walk
amongst
the
flower
.
<EOS>
within
,
the
long
vista
of
the
school

room
present
a
thronging
,
undulating
,
murmuring
,
wave
,
stream
multitude
,
all
rise
,
and
blue
,
and
half
translucent
white
.
<EOS>
there
be
lustre
burn
overhead
;
far
off
there
be
a
stage
,
a
solemn
green
curtain
,
a
row
of
footlight
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nest
-
ce
pas

"
demand
my
companion
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
say
it
be
,
but
my
heart
get
up
into
my
throat
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
discover
this
,
and
give
me
a
side
-
scowl
and
a
little
shake
for
my
pain
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
my
good
,
but
I
wish
it
be
over
,
"
say
I
<EOS>
;
then
I
ask
:
"
be
we
to
walk
through
that
crowd
?
"
  
"
by
no
means
:
I
manage
matter
better
:
we
pass
through
the
garden
 
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
an
instant
we
be
out
of
door
:
the
cool
,
calm
night
revive
me
somewhat
.
<EOS>
It
be
moonless
,
but
the
reflex
from
the
many
glowing
window
light
the
court
brightly
,
and
even
the
alley
 
dimly
.
<EOS>
Heaven
be
cloudless
,
and
grand
with
the
quiver
of
its
live
fire
.
<EOS>
how
soft
be
the
night
of
the
Continent
!
<EOS>
how
bland
,
balmy
,
safe
!
<EOS>
no
sea
-
fog
;
no
chilling
damp
:
mistless
as
noon
,
and
fresh
as
morning
.
  
<EOS>
have
cross
court
and
garden
,
we
reach
the
glass
door
of
the
first
classe

<EOS>
It
stand
open
,
like
all
other
door
that
night
;
we
pass
,
and
then
I
be
usher
into
a
small
cabinet
,
divide
the
first
classe
from
the
grand
salle
.
<EOS>
this
cabinet
dazzle
me
,
it
be
so
full
of
light
<EOS>
:
it
deafen
me
,
it
be
clamorous
with
voice
<EOS>
:
it
stifle
me
,
it
be
so
hot
,
choking
,
thronged

<EOS>
"
De

Du

cry
M.

<EOS>
"
be
this
chaos

,
he
demand
;
and
there
be
a
hush
.
<EOS>
with
a
dozen
word
,
and
as
many
gesture
,
he
turn
out
half
the
person
present
,
and
oblige
the
remnant
to
fall
into
rank
.
<EOS>
those
left
be
all
in
costume
:
they
be
the
performer
,
and
this
be
the
green
-
room
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
introduce
me
.
<EOS>
all
stare
and
some
titter
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
surprise
:
they
have
not
expect
the
Englishwoman
would
play
in
a
_
vaudeville

.
<EOS>
Ginevra
Fanshawe
,
beautifully
dress
for
her
part
,
and
look
fascinatingly
pretty
,
turn
on
me
a
pair
of
eye
as
round
as
bead

<EOS>
in
the
high
spirit
,
unperturbed
by
fear
or
bashfulness
,
delighted
indeed
at
the
thought
of
shine
off

<EOS>
my
entrance
seem
to
transfix
her
with
amazement
in
the
midst
of
her
joy

<EOS>
She
would
have
exclaim
,
but
M.
Paul
hold
her
and
all
the
rest
in
check
.
  
<EOS>
have
survey
and
criticize
the
whole
troop

<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
to
be

not

<EOS>
I
have

M.

may

I

<EOS>
I
say
so

with
a
voice
as
resolute
in
intent
,
as
it
be
low
,
and
perhaps
unsteady
in
utterance

<EOS>
He
do
not
immediately
storm
or
rage
,
as
I
fully
think
he
would
he
stand
silent
.
<EOS>
but
Zélie
again
interpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
make

She
seek
his

<EOS>
I
watch

likewise
,
for
a
glance

<EOS>
He
give
her

one

he

slowly

<EOS>
everybody
await

He

"
You

I

how

just

<EOS>
Monsieur

without
another
word

take
the
costume
from
St.
Pierre
,
give
it
to
me
,
and
permit
me
to
pass
into
the
dressing

room
.
<EOS>
once
alone
,
I
grow
calm
,
and
collectedly
go
to
work
.
<EOS>
retain
my
woman

garb
without
the
slight
retrenchment
,
I
merely
assume
,
in
addition
,
a
little
vest
,
a
collar

and
cravat

small

<EOS>
have
loosen

make
up

<EOS>
"
after
the
play
,
after
the
play
,
"
say
M.
Paul
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
then
divide
my
pair
of
pistol
between
you
,
and
we
will
settle
the
dispute
accord
to
form
:
it
will
only
be
the
old
quarrel
of
France
and
England
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
now
the
moment
approach
for
the
performance
to
commence
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
,
set
us
before
him
,
harangue
us
briefly
,
like
a
general
address
soldier
about
to
charge
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
he
say
,
except
that
he
recommend
each
to
penetrate
herself
with
a
sense
of
her
personal
insignificance
.
<EOS>
God
know
I
think
this
advice
superfluous
for
some
of
us
.
<EOS>
a
bell
tinkle
.
<EOS>
I
and
two
more
be
usher
on
to
the
stage
.
<EOS>
the
bell
tinkle
again
.
<EOS>
I
have
to
speak
the
very
first
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
look
at
the
crowd
,
nor
think
of
it
,
"
whisper
M.
Paul
in
my
ear
.
"
<EOS>
imagine
yourself
in
the
garret
,
act
to
the
rat
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
vanish
.
<EOS>
the
curtain
draw
up
 
shrivel
to
the
ceiling
:
the
bright
light
,
the
long
room
,
the
gay
throng
,
burst
upon
us
.
<EOS>
I
think
of
the
black
-
beetle
,
the
old
box
,
the
worm
-
eat
bureau
.
<EOS>
I
say
my
say
badly
;
but
I
say
it
.
<EOS>
that
first
speech
be
the
difficulty
;
it
reveal
to
me
this
fact
,
that
it
be
not
the
crowd
I
fear
so
much
as
my
own
voice
.
<EOS>
foreigner
and
stranger
,
the
crowd
be
nothing
to
me
.
<EOS>
nor
do
I
think
of
them
.
<EOS>
when
my
tongue
once
get
free
,
and
my
voice
take
its
true
pitch
,
and
find
its
natural
tone
,
I
think
of
nothing
but
the
personage
I
represent
 
and
of
M.
Paul
,
who
be
listen
,
watch
,
prompt
in
the
side
-
scene
.
  
<EOS>
by
-
and
-
by
,
feel
the
right
power
<EOS>
come
 
the
spring
demand
gush
and
rise
inwardly
 
<EOS>
I
become
sufficiently
compose
to
notice
my
fellow
-
actor
.
<EOS>
some
of
them
play
very
well
;
especially
Ginevra
Fanshawe
,
who
have
to
coquette
between
two
suitor
,
and
manage
admirably
:
in
fact
she
be
in
her
element
.
<EOS>
I
observe
that
she
once
or
twice
throw
a
certain
marked
fondness
and
pointed
partiality
into
her
manner
towards
me
 
the
fop
.
<EOS>
with
such
emphasis
and
animation
do
she
favour
me
,
such
glance
do
she
dart
out
into
the
listening
and
applaud
crowd
,
that
to
me
 
who
know
her
 
it
presently
become
evident
she
be
act
_
at
_
some
one
;
and
I
follow
her
eye
,
her
smile
,
her
gesture
,
and
ere
long
discover
that
she
have
at
least
single
out
a
handsome
and
distinguished
aim
for
her
shaft
;
full
in
the
path
of
those
arrow
 
tall
than
other
spectator
,
and
therefore
more
sure
to
receive
them
 
stand
,
in
attitude
quiet
but
intent
,
a
well
-
know
form
 
that
of
Dr.
John
.
  
<EOS>
the
spectacle
seem
somehow
suggestive
.
<EOS>
there
be
language
in
Dr.
John
's
look
,
though
I
can
not
tell
what
he
say
;
it
animate
me
:
<EOS>
I
draw
out
of
it
a
history
;
I
put
my
idea
into
the
part
I
per
form
;
I
throw
it
into
my
wooing
of
Ginevra
.
<EOS>
in
the
"
Ours
,
"
or
sincere
lover
,
I
see
Dr.
John
.
<EOS>
do
I
pity
him
,
as
erst
?
<EOS>
no
,
I
harden
my
heart
,
rival
and
out
-
rival
him
.
<EOS>
I
know
myself
but
a
fop
,
but
where
_
he
_
be
outcast
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
could
please
.
<EOS>
now
I
know
act
as
if
wishful
and
resolute
to
win
and
conquer
.
<EOS>
Ginevra
second
me
;
between
us
we
half
-
change
the
nature
of
the
_
rôle
_
,
gild
it
from
top
to
toe
.
<EOS>
between
the
act
M.
Paul
,
tell
us
he
know
not
what
possess
us
,
and
half
expostulated
.
"
<EOS>
c'
peut
-
être
plus
beau
que
votre
modèle
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
mais
ce
n'est
pas
juste
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
what
possess
me
either
;
but
somehow
,
my
longing
be
to
eclipse
the
"
Ours
,
"
_
<EOS>
i.e.
_
,
Dr.
John
.
<EOS>
Ginevra
be
tender
;
how
could
I
be
otherwise
than
chivalric
?
<EOS>
retain
the
letter
,
I
recklessly
alter
the
spirit
of
the
_
rôle
_
.
<EOS>
without
heart
,
without
interest
,
I
could
not
play
it
at
all
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
play
 
in
<EOS>
go
the
yearn
-
for
seasoning
 
thus
favour
<EOS>
,
I
play
it
with
relish
.
  
<EOS>
what
I
feel
that
night
,
and
what
I
do
,
I
no
more
expect
to
feel
and
do
,
than
to
be
lift
in
a
trance
to
the
seventh
heaven
.
<EOS>
cold
,
reluctant
,
apprehensive
,
I
have
accept
a
part
to
please
another
:
<EOS>
ere
long
,
warming
,
become
interested
,
take
courage
,
I
act
to
please
myself
.
<EOS>
yet
the
next
day
,
when
I
think
it
over
,
I
quite
disapprove
of
these
amateur
performance
;
and
though
glad
that
I
have
oblige
M.
Paul
,
and
try
my
own
strength
for
once
,
I
take
a
firm
resolution
,
never
to
be
draw
into
a
similar
affair
.
<EOS>
a
keen
relish
for
dramatic
expression
have
reveal
itself
as
part
of
my
nature
;
to
cherish
and
exercise
this
new
-
find
faculty
may
gift
me
with
a
world
of
delight
,
but
it
would
not
do
for
a
mere
looker
-
on
at
life
:
<EOS>
the
strength
and
longing
must
be
put
by
;
and
I
put
them
by
,
and
fasten
them
in
with
the
lock
of
a
resolution
which
neither
Time
nor
Temptation
have
since
pick
.
  
<EOS>
no
sooner
be
the
play
over
,
and
_
<EOS>
well
_
over
,
<EOS>
than
the
choleric
and
arbitrary
M.
Paul
undergo
a
metamorphosis
.
<EOS>
His
hour
of
managerial
responsibility
past
,
he
at
once
lay
aside
his
magisterial
austerity
;
in
a
moment
he
stand
amongst
us
,
vivacious
,
kind
,
and
social
,
shake
hand
with
us
all
round
,
thank
us
separately
,
and
announce
his
determination
that
each
of
us
should
in
turn
be
his
partner
in
the
come
ball
.
<EOS>
on
his
claim
my
promise
,
I
tell
him
I
do
not
dance
.
"
<EOS>
for
once
I
must
,
"
be
the
answer
;
and
if
I
have
not
slip
aside
and
keep
out
of
his
way
,
he
would
have
compel
me
to
this
second
performance
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
act
enough
for
one
evening
;
it
be
time
I
retire
into
myself
and
my
ordinary
life
.
<EOS>
My
dun
-
colour
dress
do
well
enough
under
a
paletôt
on
the
stage
,
but
would
not
suit
a
waltz
or
a
quadrille
.
<EOS>
withdraw
to
a
quiet
nook
,
whence
unobserved
I
could
observe
 
the
ball
,
its
splendour
and
its
pleasure
,
pass
before
me
as
a
spectacle
.
  
<EOS>
Again
Ginevra
Fanshawe
be
the
belle
,
the
fair
and
the
gay
present
;
she
be
select
to
open
the
ball
:
<EOS>
very
lovely
she
look
,
very
gracefully
she
dance
,
<EOS>
very
joyously
she
smile
.
<EOS>
such
scene
be
her
triumph
 
<EOS>
she
be
the
child
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
work
or
suffering
find
her
listless
and
dejected
,
powerless
and
repine
;
but
gaiety
expand
her
butterfly
's
wing
,
light
up
their
gold
-
dust
and
bright
spot
,
make
her
flash
like
a
gem
,
and
flush
like
a
flower
.
<EOS>
at
all
ordinary
diet
and
plain
beverage
she
would
pout
;
but
she
feed
on
cream
and
ice
like
a
humming
-
bird
on
honey
-
paste
:
sweet
wine
be
her
element
,
and
sweet
cake
her
daily
bread
.
<EOS>
Ginevra
live
her
full
life
in
a
ball
-
room
;
elsewhere
she
droop
dispirit
.
  
<EOS>
think
not
,
reader
,
that
she
thus
bloom
and
sparkle
for
the
mere
sake
of
M.
Paul
,
her
partner
,
or
that
she
lavish
her
good
grace
that
night
for
the
edification
of
her
companion
only
,
or
for
that
of
the
parent
and
grand
-
parent
,
who
fill
the
carré
,
and
line
the
ball
-
room
;
under
circumstance
so
insipid
and
limited
,
with
motive
so
chilly
and
vapid
,
Ginevra
would
scarce
have
deign
to
walk
one
quadrille
,
and
weariness
and
fretfulness
would
have
replace
animation
and
good
-
humour
,
but
she
know
of
a
leaven
in
the
otherwise
heavy
festal
mass
which
light
the
whole
;
she
taste
a
condiment
which
give
it
zest
;
she
perceive
reason
justify
the
display
of
her
choicest
attraction
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
ball
-
room
,
indeed
,
not
a
single
male
spectator
be
to
be
see
who
be
not
married
and
a
father
 
M.
Paul
except
 
that
gentleman
,
too
,
be
the
sole
creature
of
his
sex
permit
to
lead
out
a
pupil
to
the
dance
;
and
this
exceptional
part
be
allow
him
,
partly
as
a
matter
of
old
-
established
custom
<EOS>
(
for
he
be
a
kinsman
of
Madame
Beck
's
,
and
high
in
her
confidence
)
,
partly
because
he
would
always
have
his
own
way
and
do
as
he
please
,
and
partly
because
 
wilful
,
passionate
,
partial
,
as
he
may
be
 
he
be
the
soul
of
honour
,
and
may
be
trust
with
a
regiment
of
the
fair
and
pure
;
in
perfect
security
that
under
his
leadership
they
would
come
to
no
harm
.
<EOS>
many
of
the
girl
 
<EOS>
it
may
be
note
in
parenthesis
 
be
not
pure
-
minded
at
all
,
very
much
otherwise
;
but
they
no
more
dare
betray
their
natural
coarseness
in
M.
Paul
's
presence
,
than
they
dare
tread
purposely
on
his
corn
,
laugh
in
his
face
during
a
stormy
apostrophe
,
or
speak
above
their
breath
while
some
crisis
of
irritability
be
cover
his
human
visage
with
the
mask
of
an
intelligent
tiger
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
,
then
,
may
dance
with
whom
he
would
 
and
woe
be
to
the
interference
which
put
him
out
of
step
.
  
<EOS>
other
there
be
admit
as
spectator
 
with
(
seem
)
reluctance
,
through
prayer
,
by
influence
,
under
restriction
,
by
special
and
difficult
exercise
of
Madame
Beck
's
gracious
good
-
nature
,
and
whom
she
all
the
evening
 
with
her
own
personal
surveillance
 
keep
far
aloof
at
the
remote
,
drear
,
cold
,
dark
side
of
the
carré
 
<EOS>
a
small
,
forlorn
band
of
"
jeune

;
"
these
be
all
of
the
good
family
,
grow
-
up
son
of
mother
present
,
and
whose
sister
be
pupil
in
the
school
.
<EOS>
that
whole
evening
be
Madame
on
duty
beside
these
"
jeune
gen
"
 
attentive
to
them
as
a
mother
,
but
strict
with
them
as
a
dragon
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
sort
of
cordon
stretch
before
them
,
which
they
weary
her
with
prayer
to
be
permit
to
pass
,
and
just
to
revive
themselves
by
one
dance
with
that
"
belle
blonde
,
"
or
that
"
jolie
brune
,
"
or
"
cette

magnifique
aux
cheveux
noirs
comme

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Taisez

<EOS>
Madame
would
reply
,
heroically
and
inexorably
.
"
<EOS>
vous

pas
<EOS>
à

que

qu'avec
<EOS>
la
nonnette

"
<EOS>
(
allude
to
the
legend
)
.
<EOS>
and
she
majestically
walk
to
and
fro
along
their
disconsolate
and
impatient
line
,
like
a
little
Bonaparte
in
a
mouse
-
colour
silk
gown
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
know
something
of
the
world
;
Madame
know
much
of
human
nature
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
another
directress
in
Villette
would
have
dare
to
admit
a
"
jeune
homme
"
within
her
wall
;
but
Madame
know
that
by
grant
such
admission
,
on
an
occasion
like
the
present
,
a
bold
stroke
may
be
strike
,
and
a
great
point
gain
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
the
parent
be
make
accomplice
to
the
deed
,
for
it
be
only
through
their
mediation
it
be
bring
about
.
<EOS>
secondly
:
the
admission
of
these
rattlesnake
,
so
fascinating
and
so
dangerous
,
serve
to
draw
out
Madame
precisely
in
her
strong
character
 
that
of
a
first
-
rate
_
surveillante
_
.
<EOS>
thirdly
:
their
presence
furnish
a
most
piquant
ingredient
to
the
entertainment
:
the
pupil
know
it
,
and
see
it
,
and
the
view
of
such
golden
apple
shine
afar
off
,
animate
them
with
a
spirit
no
other
circumstance
could
have
kindle
.
<EOS>
the
child
's
pleasure
spread
to
the
parent
;
life
and
mirth
circulate
quickly
round
the
ball
-
room
;
the
"
jeune
gen
"
themselves
,
though
restrained
,
be
amuse
:
for
Madame
never
permit
them
to
feel
dull
 
and
thus
Madame
Beck
's
fête
annually
ensure
a
success
unknown
to
the
fête
of
any
other
directress
in
the
land
.
  
<EOS>
I
observe
that
Dr.
John
be
at
first
permit
to
walk
at
large
through
the
class
:
there
be
about
him
a
manly
,
responsible
look
,
that
redeem
his
youth
,
and
half
-
expiate
his
beauty
;
but
as
soon
as
the
ball
begin
,
Madame
run
up
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
come

Wolf
;
come

"
say
she
,
laugh
:
"
you
wear
sheep

clothing

but
you
must
quit
the
fold
notwithstanding
.
<EOS>
come
;
I
have
a
fine
menagerie

twenty
here
in
the
carré
:
let
me
place
you
amongst
my
collection

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
first
suffer
me
to
have
one
dance
with
one
pupil
of
my
choice
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
have
you
the
face
to
ask
such
a
thing
?
<EOS>
It
be
madness

it

<EOS>
She
drive
him
before
her

and
soon
have
him
enclose
within
the
cordon
.
  
<EOS>
Ginevra
being
,
I
suppose
,
tired
with
dancing
,
seek
me
out
in
my
retreat
.
<EOS>
She
throw
herself
on
the
bench
beside
me
,
and
(
a
demonstration
I
could
very
well
have
dispense
with
)
<EOS>
cast
her
arm
round
my
neck

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
without
resistance

,
or
remark
,
I
stand
and
let
her
self

love
have
its
feast
and
triumph
:
curious
to
see
how
much
it
could
swallow
 
whether
it
be
possible
<EOS>
it
could
feed
to
satiety
 
whether
any

consideration

penetrate

moderate
its
vainglorious
exultation

<EOS>
not

on

in

I

expectation

the

I
have
abundant
accomplishment

I

pretty

this

I

from

put
me
in

I
do
so

turn
red

pale

scowl

dart
fiery
glance
at

languish
one
at

I
suppose
you
be
nobody

you
take
care
of

you
first
come

you
have
no

you
can
not

yourself
young

twenty

three

you
have
no
attractive
accomplishment
 
no

<EOS>
as
to
admirer

you
hardly
know
what
they
be

you
can
not

talk
on

you
sit
dumb
when
the
other
teacher
quote
their
conquest

<EOS>
I
believe
you
never
be

,
and
never
will
be

you
do
not
know
the
feeling

so
much

"
  
<EOS>
"
a
good

be
true

shrewd
besides

<EOS>
there
must
be
good
in

,
turn
,

keep
them
too
far
off

<EOS>
let
us
cross
the

enter
by

close
to
them
behind

scold

<EOS>
for
once
,
I
do
not

<EOS>
through
the
garden
we
go
 
penetrate
into
the
corridor
by
a
quiet
private
entrance
,
and
approach
the
_
carré
_
,
yet
keep
in
the
corridor
shade
,
command
a
near
view
of
the
band

"
  
<EOS>
I
believe
I
could
have
pick
out
the
conquering
de
Hamal
even
undirected
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
straight
-
nosed
,
very
correct
-
feature
little
dandy
.
<EOS>
I
say
_
little
_
dandy
,
though
he
be
not
beneath
the
middle
standard
in
stature
;
but
his
lineament
be
small
,
and
so
be
his
hand
and
foot
;
and
he
be
pretty
and
smooth
,
and
as
trim
as
a
doll
:
so
nicely
dress
,
so
nicely
curl
,
so
booted
and
glove
and
cravate
 
<EOS>
he
be
charm
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
what
,
a
dear
personage
!
<EOS>
"
cry
I
,
and
commend
Ginevra
's
taste
warmly
;
and
ask
her
what
she
think
de
Hamal
may
have
do
with
the
precious
fragment
of
that
heart
she
have
break
 
whether
he
keep
them
in
a
scent
-
vial
,
and
conserve
them
in
otto
of
rose
?
<EOS>
I
observe
,
too
,
with
deep
rapture
of
approbation
,
that
the
colonel
's
hand
be
scarce
large
than
Miss
Fanshawe
's
own
,
and
suggest
that
this
circumstance
may
be
convenient
,
as
he
could
wear
her
glove
at
a
pinch
.
<EOS>
on
his
dear
curl
,
I
tell
her
I
doate
:
and
as
to
his
low
,
grecian
brow
,
and
exquisite
classic
headpiece
,
I
confess
I
have
no
language
to
do
such
perfection
justice
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
if
he
be
your
lover
?
"
suggest
the
cruelly
exultant
Ginevra
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
heavens
,
what
bliss
!
"
say
I
;
"
but
do
not
be
inhuman
,
Miss
Fanshawe
:
to
put
such
thought
into
my
head
be
like
show
poor
outcast

Cain
a
far
,
glimpse
of
Paradise

<EOS>
"
You
like

as
I

comfit
,
and

flower

"
  
<EOS>
Ginevra
admire
my
taste
,
for
all
these
thing
be
her
adoration
;
she
could
then
readily
credit
that
they
be
mine
too

<EOS>
"
now
for
Isidore
,
"
I
go
on
.
<EOS>
I
own
<EOS>
I
feel
still
more
curious
to
see
him
than
his
rival

Ginevra
be
absorb
in
the
latter

<EOS>
"
Alfred

admit
here

night

,
"
through

be
such
good
fun

first
at

then
at

madden
them
both

in

,
and
height
,
and
passion
,
and
talent
for
which
I
have
no
taste
.
<EOS>
there
now
.
<EOS>
do
not
hold
me
so
fast
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
slacken
my
grasp
,
and
she
dart
off
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
to
pursue
her
.
  
<EOS>
somehow
I
could
not
avoid
return
once
more
in
the
direction
of
the
corridor
to
get
another
glimpse
of
Dr.
John
;
but
I
meet
him
on
the
garden
-
step
,
stand
where
the
light
from
a
window
fall
broad
.
<EOS>
His
well
-
proportion
figure
be
not
to
be
mistake
,
for
I
doubt
whether
there
be
another
in
that
assemblage
his
equal
.
<EOS>
He
carry
his
hat
in
his
hand
;
his
uncovered
head
,
his
face
and
fine
brow
be
most
handsome
and
manly
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
His
_
feature
be
not
delicate
,
not
slight
like
those
of
a
woman
,
nor
be
they
cold
,
frivolous
,
and
feeble
;
though
well
cut
,
they
be
not
so
chisel
,
so
fritter
away
,
as
to
lose
in
expression
or
significance
what
they
gain
in
unmeaning
symmetry
.
<EOS>
much
feeling
speak
in
them
at
time
,
and
more
sit
silent
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
such
at
least
be
my
thought
of
him
:
to
me
he
seem
all
this
.
<EOS>
an
inexpressible
sense
of
wonder
occupy
me
,
as
I
look
at
this
man
,
and
reflect
that
_
he
_
could
not
be
slight
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
,
not
my
intention
to
approach
or
address
him
in
the
garden
,
our
term
of
acquaintance
not
warrant
such
a
step
;
I
have
only
mean
to
view
him
in
the
crowd
 
myself
unseen
:
come
upon
him
thus
alone
,
I
withdraw
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
look
out
for
me
,
or
rather
for
her
who
have
be
with
me
:
therefore
he
descend
the
step
,
and
follow
me
down
the
alley
.
  
<EOS>
"
You

Miss
Fanshawe

I

often

I

shake

have
shake

out

away

Would
you

by
watch
over

observe

not

run
out
into
the
night

air
immediately

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
,
perhaps
,
look
after
her
a
little
;
since
you

it

she
like
her
own
way
too
well
to
submit
readily
to
control

<EOS>
"
under

have
talk

I

add
that

only
within

I
have
discover
that
you

Dr.

for

I

be
accustom

<EOS>
Mrs.

her

be
an
acquaintance

thus
I
see
her
every
Sunday

<EOS>
but
you
observe
that
under
the
name
of

she
often
speak
of
me
:
may
I
 
without
invite
you
to
a
breach

confidence
 
<EOS>
inquire
<EOS>
what
be
the
tone
,
<EOS>
what
the
feeling
of
her
remark

<EOS>
I
feel
somewhat
anxious

be
a
little
torment
with
uncertainty
as

how
I
stand
with

she
vary

she
shift

still
,
you
can
gather
some
general
idea

I
can
,

think
I
,

it
would
not

now
I
pause
.
<EOS>
for
the
second
time
that
night
I
be
go
beyond
myself
 
venture
out
of
what
I
look
on
as
my
natural
habit
 
speak
in
an
unpremeditated
,
impulsive
strain
,
which
startle
me
strangely
when
I
halt
to
reflect
.
<EOS>
on
rise
that
morning
,
have
I
anticipate
that
before
night
I
should
have
act
the
part
of
a
gay
lover
in
a
vaudeville
;
and
an
hour
after
,
frankly
discuss
with
Dr.
John
the
question
of
his
hapless
suit
,
and
rally
him
on
his
illusion
?
<EOS>
I
have
no
more
presaged
such
feat
than
I
have
look
forward
to
an
ascent
in
a
balloon
,

a
voyage
to
Cape
Horn

<EOS>
the
Doctor

I

have
pace
down

be
now
return
;
the
reflex
from
the
window
again
light
his
face
:
he
smile
,
but
his
eye
be
melancholy
.
<EOS>
how
I
wish
that
he
could
feel
heart's

ease
!
<EOS>
how
I
grieve
that
he
brood
over
pain

from
such

<EOS>
I
do
not
then
know
that
the
pensiveness

reverse

the
good
phase
for
some
mind

I
reflect

<EOS>
in

speech
I
get
 
<EOS>
what
,
it
must
be
suppose
,
I
deserve
 
a
look
of
surprise
:
I
think
also
of
some
disapprobation

We
part
,

I
go
into

house
very
chill

clock
strike

bell
toll
midnight

in
another

dark

hushed

not
asleep

to
me
it
be
not
easy
to
sleep

a
day

such
excitement

<EOS>
the
long
vacation

<EOS>
follow
Madame

burst

hilarity

dissipation

its
one
subsequent
day

utter
languor

a
period

reaction

two
month

indeed
the

genuine

<EOS>
to
them
be
procrastinate

the
distribution

prize

<EOS>
candidate
for
reward
have
then
to
work
in
good
earnest

master

have
to
set
their
shoulder
to
the
wheel

to
urge
on

backward

diligently
aid

train
the
more
promising

<EOS>
a
showy
demonstration
 
a
tell
exhibition
 
must
be
get
up
for
public
view
,
and
all
mean
be
fair
to
this
end
.
  
<EOS>
I
scarcely
note
how
the
other
teacher
go
to
work
;
I
have
my
own
business
to
mind
;
and
_
<EOS>
my

task
be
not
the
least
onerous
,
be
to
imbue
some
ninety
set
of
brain
with
a
due
tincture
of
what
they
consider
a
most
complicated
and
difficult
science
,
that
of
the
english
language
;
and
to
drill
ninety
tongue
in
what
,
for
them
,
be
an
almost
impossible
pronunciation
 
the
lisp
and
hiss
dental
of
the

<EOS>
the
examination
-
day
arrive
.
<EOS>
awful
day
!
<EOS>
prepare
for
with
anxious
care

dress
for
with
silent
despatch
 
<EOS>
nothing
vaporous
or
flutter
now
 
no

gauze

azure
streamer

the
grave
,
close

compact

the
order
of
the
toilette

It
seem
to
me
that
I
be
this
day
,
especially
doom
 
the
main
burden
and
trial
fall
on
me
alone
of
all
the
female
teacher
.
<EOS>
the
other
be
not
expect
to
examine
in
the
study
they
teach
;
the
professor
of
literature
,
M.
Paul

take
upon
himself
this
duty
.
<EOS>
He
,
this
school
autocrat
,
gather
all
and
sundry
rein
into
the
hollow
of
his
one
hand

he
irefully
reject
any
colleague
;
he
would
not
have
help

<EOS>
Madame
herself
,
who
evidently
rather
wish
to
undertake
the
examination
in
geography
 
her
favourite
study
,
which
she
teach
well
 
be
force
to
succumb
,
and
be
subordinate
to
her
despotic
kinsman

direction

<EOS>
the
whole
staff
of
instructor
,
male
and
female

he
set
aside
,
and
stand
on

estrade
alone

It
irk
him
that
he
be
force
to
make
one
exception
to
this
rule

<EOS>
He
could
not
manage
English
:
he
be
oblige
to
leave
that
branch
of
education
in
the
english
teacher
's
hand
;
which
he
do
,
not
without
a
flash
of
naïve
jealousy

<EOS>
a
constant
crusade
against
the

be
the
crotchet

little
man

<EOS>
He
have
a
strong
relish
for
public
representation

extreme
abhorrence
of

display
in

He

down

and
when
he
could
not

he
fume
like
a

<EOS>
on
the
evening
precede
the
examination
-
day

I
be
walk

<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
join
me
in
the
"
allée
défendue
;
"
his
cigar
be
at
his
lip
;
his
paletôt
 
a
most
characteristic
garment
of
no
particular
shape
 
hung
dark
and
menacing
;
the
tassel
of
his
bonnet
grec
sternly
shadow
his
left
temple
;
his
black
whisker
curl
like
those
of
a
wrathful
cat
;
his
blue
eye
have
a
cloud
in
its
glitter
.
  
<EOS>
"

begin
,
abruptly
front
and
arrest
me
,
"

<EOS>
now
the
fact
be
,
he
happen
to
be
entirely
mistaken
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
 
could
not
 
estimate
the
admiration
or
the
good
opinion
of
tomorrow
's
audience
at
the
same
rate
he
do
.
<EOS>
have
that
audience
number
as
many
personal
friend
and
acquaintance
for
me
as
for
him
,
I
know
not
how
it
may
have
be
<EOS>
:
I
speak
of
the
case
as
it
stand
.
<EOS>
on
me
school
-
triumph
shed
but
a
cold
lustre
.
<EOS>
I
have
wonder
 
<EOS>
and
I
wonder
now
 
how
it
be
that
for
him
they
seem
to
shine
as
with
hearth
-
warmth
and
hearth
-
glow
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
care
for
them
perhaps
too
much
;
_
<EOS>
I
_
,
probably
,
too
little
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
have
my
own
fancy
as
well
as
he
.
<EOS>
I
like
,
for
instance
,
to
see
M.
Emanuel
jealous
;
it
light
up
his
nature
,
and
wake
his
spirit
;
it
throw
all
sort
of
queer
light
and
shadow
over
his
dun
face
,
and
into
his
violet
-
azure
eye
(
he
use
to
say
that
his
black
hair
and
blue
eye
be
"
une
de
ses
beautés
"
)
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
relish
in
his
anger
;
it
be
artless
,
earnest
,
quite
unreasonable
,
but
never
hypocritical
.
<EOS>
I
utter
no
disclaimer
then
of
the
complacency
he
attribute
to
me
;
I
merely
ask
where
the
english
examination
come
in
 
whether
at
the
commencement
or
close
of
the
day
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
hesitate

"
say
he
,
"
whether
at
the
very
beginning
,
before
many
person
be
come
,
and
when
your

nature
will
not
be
gratify
by
a
large
audience

quite
at
the
close

when
everybody
be
tired

only
a

I
do

I

Madame

go
,
the
first
day
of
the
holiday

to
join
her
child
at
the
sea

side

all
the
three
teacher
have
parent

they
take
refuge

every
professor
quit
the
city

some

some

Marine

M.

set
forth
on

pilgrimage
to
Rome

the
house
be
leave
quite
empty
,
but
for
me
,
a
servant
,
and
a
poor
deform
and
imbecile
pupil
,
a
sort
of
crétin
,
whom
her
stepmother
in
a
distant
province
would
not
allow
to
return
home
.
  
<EOS>
My
heart
almost
die
within
me
;
miserable
longing
strain
its
chord
.
<EOS>
how
long
be
the
September
day
!
<EOS>
how
silent
,
how
lifeless
!
<EOS>
how
vast
and
void
seem
the
desolate
premise
!
<EOS>
how
gloomy
the
forsaken
garden
 
grey
now
with
the
dust
of
a
town
summer
depart
.
<EOS>
look
forward
at
the
commencement
of
those
eight
week
,
I
hardly
know
how
I
be
to
live
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
My
spirit
have
long
be
gradually
sink
;
now
that
the
prop
of
employment
be
withdraw
,
they
go
down
fast
.
<EOS>
even
to
look
forward
be
not
to
hope
:
the
dumb
future
speak
no
comfort
,
offer
no
promise
,
give
no
inducement
to
bear
present
evil
in
reliance
on
future
good
.
<EOS>
a
sorrowful
indifference
to
existence
often
press
on
me
 
a
despairing
resignation
to
reach
betime
the
end
of
all
thing
earthly
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
when
I
have
full
leisure
to
look
on
life
as
life
must
be
look
on
by
such
as
me
,
I
find
it
but
a
hopeless
desert
:
tawny
sand
,
with
no
green
field
,
no
palm
-
tree
,
no
well
in
view
.
<EOS>
the
hope
which
be
dear
to
youth
,
which
bear
it
up
and
lead
it
on
,
I
know
not
and
dare
not
know
.
<EOS>
if
they
knock
at
my
heart
sometimes
,
an
inhospitable
bar
to
admission
must
be
inwardly
draw
.
<EOS>
when
they
turn
away
thus
reject
,
tear
sad
enough
sometimes
flow
:
but
it
could
not
be
help
:
I
dare
not
give
such
guest
lodge
.
<EOS>
so
mortally
do
I
fear
the
sin
and
weakness
of
presumption
.
  
<EOS>
religious
reader
,
you
will
preach
to
me
a
long
sermon
about
what
I
have
just
write
,
and
so
will
you
,
moralist
:
<EOS>
and
you
,
stern
sage
:
you
,
stoic
,
will
frown
;
<EOS>
you
,
cynic
,
sneer
;
you
,
epicure
,
laugh
.
<EOS>
well
,
each
and
all
,
take
it
your
own
way
.
<EOS>
I
accept
the
sermon
,
frown
,
sneer
,
and
laugh
;
perhaps
you
be
all
right
:
and
perhaps
,
circumstance
like
me
,
you
would
have
be
,
like
me
,
wrong
.
<EOS>
the
first
month
be
,
indeed
,
a
long
,
black
,
heavy
month
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
crétin
do
not
seem
unhappy
.
<EOS>
I
do
my
good
to
feed
her
well
and
keep
her
warm
,
and
she
only
ask
food
and
sunshine
,
or
when
that
lack
,
fire
.
<EOS>
Her
weak
faculty
approve
of
inertion
:
her
brain
,
her
eye
,
her
ear
,
her
heart
sleep
content
;
they
could
not
wake
to
work
,
so
lethargy
be
their
Paradise
.
  
<EOS>
three
week
of
that
vacation
be
hot
,
fair
,
and
dry
,
but
the
fourth
and
fifth
be
tempestuous
and
wet
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
why
that
change
in
the
atmosphere
make
a
cruel
impression
on
me
,
why
the
rage
storm
and
beat
rain
crush
me
with
a
deadly
paralysis
than
I
have
experience
while
the
air
have
remain
serene
;
but
so
it
be
;
and
my
nervous
system
could
hardly
support
what
it
have
for
many
day
and
night
to
undergo
in
that
huge
empty
house
.
<EOS>
how
I
use
to
pray
to
Heaven
for
consolation
and
support
!
<EOS>
with
what
dread
force
the
conviction
would
grasp
me
that
Fate
be
my
permanent
foe
,
never
to
be
conciliate
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
,
in
my
heart
,
arraign
the
mercy
or
justice
of
God
for
this
;
I
conclude
it
to
be
a
part
of
his
great
plan
that
some
must
deeply
suffer
while
they
live
,
and
I
thrill
in
the
certainty
that
of
this
number
<EOS>
,
I
be
one
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
some
relief
when
an
aunt
of
the
crétin
,
a
kind
old
woman
,
come
one
day
,
and
take
away
my
strange
,
deform
companion
.
<EOS>
the
hapless
creature
have
be
at
time
a
heavy
charge
;
I
could
not
take
her
out
beyond
the
garden
,
and
I
could
not
leave
her
a
minute
alone
:
for
her
poor
mind
,
like
her
body
,
be
warp
:
its
propensity
be
to
evil
.
<EOS>
a
vague
bent
to
mischief
,
an
aimless
malevolence
,
make
constant
vigilance
indispensable
.
<EOS>
as
she
very
rarely
speak
,
and
would
sit
for
hour
together
mope
and
mow
,
and
distort
her
feature
with
indescribable
grimace
,
it
be
more
like
be
prisone
with
some
strange
tameless
animal
,
than
associate
with
a
human
being
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
personal
attention
to
be
render
which
require
the
nerve
of
a
hospital
nurse
;
my
resolution
be
so
try
,
it
sometimes
fall
dead
-
sick
.
<EOS>
these
duty
should
not
have
fall
on
me
;
a
servant
,
now
absent
,
have
render
them
hitherto
,
and
in
the
hurry
of
holiday
departure
,
no
substitute
to
fill
this
office
have
be
provide
.
<EOS>
this
tax
and
trial
be
by
no
means
the
least
I
have
know
in
life
.
<EOS>
still
,
menial
and
distasteful
as
they
be
,
my
mental
pain
be
far
more
wasting
and
wear
.
<EOS>
attendance
on
the
crétin
deprive
me
often
of
the
power
and
inclination
to
swallow
a
meal
,
and
send
me
faint
to
the
fresh
air
,
and
the
well
or
fountain
in
the
court
;
but
this
duty
never
wring
my
heart
,
or
brim
my
eye
,
or
scald
my
cheek
with
tear
hot
as
molten
metal
.
  
<EOS>
the
crétin
be
go
,
I
be
free
to
walk
out
.
<EOS>
at
first
I
lack
courage
to
venture
very
far
from
the
Rue
Fossette
,
but
by
degree
I
seek
the
city
gate
,
and
pass
them
,
and
then
go
wander
away
far
along
chaussées
,
through
field
,
beyond
cemetery
,
Catholic
and
Protestant
,
beyond
farmstead
,
to
lane
and
little
wood
,
and
I
know
not
where
.
<EOS>
a
goad
thrust
me
on
<EOS>
,
a
fever
forbid
me
to
rest
;
a
want
of
companionship
maintain
in
my
soul
the
craving
of
a
most
deadly
famine
.
<EOS>
I
often
walk
all
day
,
through
the
burn
noon
and
the
arid
afternoon
,
and
the
dusk
evening
,
and
come
back
with
moonrise
.
  
<EOS>
while
wander
in
solitude
,
I
would
sometimes
picture
the
present
probable
position
of
other
,
my
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
there
be
Madame
Beck
at
a
cheerful
watering
-
place
with
her
child
,
her
mother
,
and
a
whole
troop
of
friend
who
have
seek
the
same
scene
of
relaxation
.
<EOS>
Zélie
St.
Pierre
be
at
Paris
,
with
her
relative
;
the
other
teacher
be
at
their
home
.
<EOS>
there
be
Ginevra
Fanshawe
,
whom
certain
of
her
connection
have
carry
on
a
pleasant
tour
southward
.
<EOS>
Ginevra
seem
to
me
the
happy
.
<EOS>
She
be
on
the
route
of
beautiful
scenery
;
these
September
sun
shone
for
her
on
fertile
plain
,
where
harvest
and
vintage
mature
under
their
mellow
beam
.
<EOS>
these
gold
and
crystal
moon
rise
on
her
vision
over
blue
horizon
wave
in
mount
line
.
  
<EOS>
but
all
this
be
nothing
;
I
too
feel
those
autumn
sun
and
see
those
harvest
moon
,
and
I
almost
wish
to
be
cover
in
with
earth
and
turf
,
deep
out
of
their
influence
;
for
I
could
not
live
in
their
light
,
nor
make
them
comrade
,
nor
yield
them
affection
.
<EOS>
but
Ginevra
have
a
kind
of
spirit
with
her
,
empower
to
give
constant
strength
and
comfort
,
to
gladden
daylight
and
embalm
darkness
;
the
good
of
the
good
genii
that
guard
humanity
curtain
her
with
his
wing

and
canopy
her
head
with
his

form

<EOS>
by
True
Love
be
Ginevra
follow
:
never
could
she
be
alone
.
<EOS>
be
she
insensible
to
this
presence
?
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
impossible
:
I
could
not
realize
such
deadness
.
<EOS>
I
imagine
her
grateful
in
secret
,
love
now
with
reserve
;
but
purpose
one
day
to
show
how
much
she
love
:
I
picture
her
faithful
hero
half
conscious
of
her
coy
fondness
,
and
comfort
by
that
consciousness
:
I
conceive
an
electric
chord
of
sympathy
between
them
,
a
fine
chain
of
mutual
understanding
,
sustain
union
through
a
separation
of
a
hundred
league
 
carrying
,
across
mound
and
hollow
,
communication
by
prayer
and
wish
.
<EOS>
Ginevra
gradually
become
with
me
a
sort
of
heroine
.
<EOS>
one
day
,
perceive
this
grow
illusion
,
I
say
,
"
I
really
believe
my

overstretch

my

have
suffer
somewhat
too
much
a
malady
be
grow
upon
it
 
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
how
shall
I
keep
well
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
indeed
there
be
no
way
to
keep
well
under
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
at
last
a
day
and
night
of
peculiarly
agonizing
depression
be
succeed
by
physical
illness
,
I
take
perforce
to
my
bed
.
<EOS>
about
this
time
the
indian
summer
close
and
the
equinoctial
storm
begin
;
and
for
nine
dark
and
wet
day
,
of
which
the
hour
rush
on
all
turbulent
,
deaf
,
dishevelled
 
bewilder
with
sound
hurricane
 
<EOS>
I
lie
in
a
strange
fever
of
the
nerve
and
blood
.
<EOS>
sleep
go
quite
away
.
<EOS>
I
use
to
rise
in
the
night
,
look
round
for
her
,
beseech
her
earnestly
to
return
.
<EOS>
a
rattle
of
the
window
,
a
cry
of
the
blast
only
reply
 
Sleep
never
come
!
  
<EOS>
I
err
.
<EOS>
She
come
once
,
but
in
anger
.
<EOS>
impatient
of
my
importunity
she
bring
with
her
an
avenge
dream
.
<EOS>
by
the
clock
of
St.
Jean
Baptiste
,
that
dream
remain
scarce
fifteen
minute
 
<EOS>
a
brief
space
,
but
suffice
to
wring
my
whole
frame
with
unknown
anguish
;
to
confer
a
nameless
experience
that
have
the
hue
,
the
mien
,
the
terror
,
the
very
tone
of
a
visitation
from
eternity
.
<EOS>
between
twelve
and
one
that
night
a

to
my

black
,
strong

strange

up
seethe

<EOS>
have
drank
and
wake
,
I
think
all
be
over
:
<EOS>
the
end
come
and
past
by
.
<EOS>
tremble
fearfully
 
as
consciousness
return
 
ready
to
cry
out
on
some
fellow

creature
to
help
me
,
only
that
I

no

near
enough
to
catch
the
wild
summon
 
<EOS>
Goton
in
her
far
distant
attic
could
not
hear
 
<EOS>
I
rise
on
my
knee
in
bed
.
<EOS>
some
fearful
hour
go
over
me
:
indescribably
be
I
tear
,
rack
and
oppress
in
mind
.
<EOS>
amidst
the
horror
of
that
dream
I
think
the
bad
lie
here

<EOS>
methought
the

love
dead

who
have
love

_
<EOS>
well
in

meet
me
elsewhere
,
alienated
:
<EOS>
gall
be
my
inmost
spirit
with
an
unutterable
sense
of
despair
about
the
future
.
<EOS>
motive
there
be
none
why
I
should
try
to
recover
or
wish
to
live
;
and
yet
quite
unendurable
be
the
pitiless
and
haughty
voice
in
which
Death
challenge
me
to
engage
his
unknown
terror
.
<EOS>
when
I
try
to
pray
I
could
only
utter
these
word
:
"
from
my
youth
up
Thy
terror
have
I
suffer
with
a
troubled
mind

"
  
<EOS>
most
true
be
it
.
  
<EOS>
on
bring
me
my
tea
next
morning
Goton
urge
me
to
call
in
a
doctor
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
:
I
think
no
doctor
could
cure
me
.
  
<EOS>
one
evening
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
not
delirious
:
<EOS>
I
be
in
my
sane
mind
,
<EOS>
I
get
up
 
I
dress
myself
,
weak
and
shake
.
<EOS>
the
solitude
and
the
stillness
of
the
long
dormitory
could
not
be
bear
any
longer
;
the
ghastly
white
bed
be
turn
into
spectre
 
the
coronal
of
each
become
a
death's
-
head
,
huge
and
sun
-
bleach
 
<EOS>
dead
dream
of
an
eld
world
and
mightier
race
lie
frozen
in
their
wide
gape
eyehole
.
<EOS>
that
evening
more
firmly
than
ever
fasten
into
my
soul
<EOS>
the
conviction
that
Fate
be
of
stone
,
and
hope
a
false
idol
 
blind
,
bloodless
,
and
of
granite
core
.
<EOS>
I
feel
,
too
,
that
the
trial
God
have
appoint
me
be
gain
its
climax
,
and
must
now
be
turn
by
my
own
hand
,
hot
,
feeble
,
tremble
as
they
be
.
<EOS>
It
rain
still
,
and
blow
;
but
with
more
clemency
,
I
think
,
than
it
have
pour
and
rage
all
day
.
<EOS>
twilight
be
fall
,
and
I
deem
its
influence
pitiful
;
from
the
lattice
I
see
come
night
-
cloud
trail
low
like
banner
droop
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
that
at
this
hour
there
be
affection
and
sorrow
in
Heaven
above
for
all
pain
suffer
on
earth
beneath
;
the
weight
of
my
dreadful
dream
become
alleviate
 
that
insufferable
thought
of
be
no
more
loved
 
no
more
owned
,
half
-
yield
to
hope
of
the
contrary
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
this
hope
would
shine
clear
if
I
get
out
from
under
this
house
-
roof
,
which
be
crush
as
the
slab
of
a
tomb
,
and
go
outside
the
city
to
a
certain
quiet
hill
,
a
long
way
distant
in
the
field
.
<EOS>
cover
with
a
cloak
(
I
could
not
be
delirious
,
for
I
have
sense
and
recollection
to
put
on
warm
clothing
)
,
forth
I
set
.
<EOS>
the
bell
of
a
church
arrest
me
in
pass
;
they
seem
to
call
me
in
to
the
_
salut
_
,
and
I
go
in
.
<EOS>
any
solemn
rite
,
any
spectacle
of
sincere
worship
,
any
opening
for
appeal
to
God
be
as
welcome
to
me
then
as
bread
to
one
in
extremity
of
want
.
<EOS>
I
knelt
down
with
other
on
the
stone
pavement
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
old
solemn
church
,
its
pervading
gloom
not
gild
but
purple
by
light
shed
through
stained
glass
.
  
<EOS>
few
worshipper
be
assemble
,
and
,
the
_
salut
_
over
,
half
of
them
depart
.
<EOS>
I
discover
soon
that
those
left
remain
to
confess
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
stir
.
<EOS>
carefully
every
door
of
the
church
be
shut
;
a
holy
quiet
sank
upon
,
and
a
solemn
shade
gather
about
us
.
<EOS>
after
a
space
,
breathless
and
spend
in
prayer
,
a
penitent
approach
the
confessional
.
<EOS>
I
watch
.
<EOS>
She
whisper
her
avowal
;
her
shrift
be
whisper
back
;
she
return
console
.
<EOS>
another
go
,
and
another
.
<EOS>
a
pale
lady
,
kneel
near
me
,
say
in
a
low
,
kind
voice
:
 
<EOS>
"
go
you
now
,
I
be
not
quite
prepared
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
mechanically
obedient
,
I
rise
and
go
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
be
about
;
my
mind
have
run
over
the
intent
with
lightning
-
speed
.
<EOS>
to
take
this
step
could
not
make
me
more
wretched
than
I
be
;
it
may
soothe
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
priest
within
the
confessional
never
turn
his
eye
to
regard
me
;
he
only
quietly
incline
his
ear
to
my
lip
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
a
good
man
,
but
this
duty
have
become
to
him
a
sort
of
form
:
he
go
through
it
with
the
phlegm
of
custom
.
<EOS>
I
hesitate
;
of
the
formula
of
confession
<EOS>
I
be
ignorant
:
instead
of
commence
,
then
,
with
the
prelude
usual
,
I
say
:
 
"
mon
père
,
je
suis
Protestante
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
directly
turn
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
native
priest
:
of
that
class
,
the
cast
of
physiognomy
be
,
almost
invariably
,
grovel
:
<EOS>
I
see
by
his
profile
and
brow
<EOS>
he
be
a
Frenchman
;
though
grey
and
advance
in
year
,
he
do
not
,
I
think
,
lack
feeling
or
intelligence
.
<EOS>
He
inquire
,
not
unkindly
,
why
,
be
a
Protestant
,
I
come
to
him
?
  
<EOS>
I
say
I
be
perish
for
a
word
of
advice
or
an
accent
of
comfort
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
live
for
some
week
quite
alone
;
I
have
be
ill
;
I
have
a
pressure
of
affliction
on
my
mind
of
which
it
would
hardly
any
longer
endure
the
weight
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
a
sin
,
a
crime
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquire
,
somewhat
startled
.
<EOS>
I
reassure
him
on
this
point
,
and
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
I
show
him
the
mere
outline
of
my
experience
.
  
<EOS>
He
look
thoughtful
,
surprised
,
puzzle
.
<EOS>
"
You
take
me
unawares
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
have
such
a
case
as
yours
before
:
ordinarily
we
know
our
routine
,
and
be
prepared
;
but
this
make
a
great
break
in
the
common
course
of
confession
.
<EOS>
I
be
hardly
furnish
with
counsel
fit
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
of
course
,
I
have
not
expect
he
would
be
;
but
the
mere
relief
of
communication
in
an
ear
which
be
human
and
sentient
,
yet
consecrate
 
the
mere
pour
out
of
some
portion
of
long
accumulating
,
long
pen
-
up
pain
into
a
vessel
whence
it
could
not
be
again
diffuse
 
have
do
me
good

<EOS>
I
be
already
solace

<EOS>
"
Must
I
go
,
father
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
of
him
as
he
sit
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
daughter
,
"
he
say
kindly
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
sure
he
be
a
kind
man
:
he
have
a
compassionate
eye
 
"
for
the
present
you
have
better
go
:
<EOS>
but
I
assure
you
your
word
have
strike
me
.
<EOS>
confession
,
like
other
thing
,
be
apt
to
become
formal
and
trivial
with
habit
.
<EOS>
You
have
come
and
pour
your
heart
out
;
a
thing
seldom
do
.
<EOS>
I
would
fain
think
your
case
over
,
and
take
it
with
me
to
my
oratory
.
<EOS>
be
you
of
our
faith
I
should
know
what
to
say
 
a
mind
so
tossed
can
find
repose
but
in
the
bosom
of
retreat
,
and
the
punctual
practice
of
piety
.
<EOS>
the
world
,
it
be
well
known
,
have
no
satisfaction
for
that
class
of
nature
.
<EOS>
holy
man
have
bid
penitent
like
you
to
hasten
their
path
upward
by
penance
,
self

denial
,
and
difficult
good
work
.
<EOS>
tear
be
give
them
here
for
meat
and
drink
 
bread
of
affliction
and
water
of
affliction
 
<EOS>
their
recompence
come
hereafter
.
<EOS>
It
be
my
own
conviction
that
these
impression
under
which
you
be
smart
be
messenger
from
God
to
bring
you
back
to
the
true
Church

<EOS>
You

depend
upon
it
our

alone
could
heal
and
help
you
 
Protestantism
be
altogether
too
dry
,
cold
,
prosaic
for
you

<EOS>
the
further
I
look
into
this
matter
,
<EOS>
the
more
plainly
I
see
it
be
entirely
out
of
the
common
order
of
thing
.
<EOS>
on
no
account
would
I
lose
sight
of
you

<EOS>
go
,
my

for
the
present

return
to
me
again

"
  
<EOS>
I
rise
and
thank
him
.
<EOS>
I
be
withdraw
when
he
sign
me
to
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
come

"
say
he
:
"
<EOS>
I
see
you

and
this

cold

you

<EOS>
I
live
 
"
<EOS>
(
and
he
give
me
his
address
)
.
<EOS>
"
be
there
to
-
morrow
morning
at
ten
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
reply
to
this
appointment
,
I
only
bow
;
and
pull
down
my
veil
,
and
gather
round
me
my
cloak
,
I
glide
away
.
  
<EOS>
do
I
,
do
you
suppose
,
reader
,
contemplate
venture
again
within
that
worthy
priest
's
reach
?
<EOS>
as
soon
should
I
have
think
of
walk
into
a
babylonish
furnace
.
<EOS>
that
priest
have
arm
which
could
influence
me
:
he
be
naturally
kind
,
with
a
sentimental
french
kindness
,
to
whose
softness
I
know
myself
not
wholly
impervious
.
<EOS>
without
respect
some
sort
of
affection
,
there
be
hardly
any
sort
have
a
fibre
of
root
in
reality
,
which
I
could
rely
on
my
force
wholly
to
withstand
.
<EOS>
have
I
go
to
him
,
he
would
have
show
me
all
that
be
tender
,
and
comforting
,
and
gentle
,
in
the
honest
popish
superstition
.
<EOS>
then
he
would
have
try
to
kindle
,
blow
and
stir
up
in
me
the
zeal
of
good
work
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
it
would
all
have
end
.
<EOS>
We
all
think
ourselves
strong
in
some
point
;
we
all
know
ourselves
weak
in
many
;
the
probability
be
that
have
I
visit
Numero
10
,
Rue
des
Mages
,
at
the
hour
and
day
appoint
,
I
may
just
now
,
instead
of
write
this
heretic
narrative
,
be
count
my
bead
in
the
cell
of
a
certain
Carmelite
convent
on
the
Boulevard
of
Crécy
,
in
Villette
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
of
Fénélon
about
that
benign
old
priest
;
and
whatever
most
of
his
brother
may
be
,
and
whatever
I
may
think
of
his
Church
and
creed
(
and
I
like
neither
)
,
of
himself
I
must
ever
retain
a
grateful
recollection
.
<EOS>
He
be
kind
when
I
need
kindness
;
he
do
me
good
.
<EOS>
May
Heaven
bless
him
!
  
<EOS>
twilight
have
pass
into
night
,
and
the
lamp
be
light
in
the
street
ere
<EOS>
I
issue
from
that
sombre
church
.
<EOS>
to
turn
back

now
become
possible
to
me
;
the
wild
longing
to
breathe
this
October
wind
on
the
little
hill
far
without
the
city
wall
have
cease
to
be
an
imperative
impulse
,
and
be
soften
into
a
wish
with
which
Reason
could
cope
:
she
put
it
down
,
and
I
turn
,
as
I
think
,
to
the
Rue
Fossette
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
become
involved
in
a
part
of
the
city
with
which
I
be
not
familiar
;
it
be
the
old
part
,
and
full
of
narrow
street
of
picturesque
,
ancient
,
and
moulder
house
.
<EOS>
I
be
much
too
weak
to
be
very
collect
,
and
I
be
still
too
careless
of
my
own
welfare
and
safety
to
be
cautious
;
I
grow
embarrassed
;
I
get
immeshe
in
a
network
of
turn
unknown
.
<EOS>
I
be
lose
and
have
no
resolution
to
ask
guidance
of
any
passenger
.
  
<EOS>
if
the
storm
have
lull
a
little
at
sunset
,
it
make
up
now
for
lose
time
.
<EOS>
strong
and
horizontal
thunder
the
current
of
the
wind
from
north
-
west
to
south
-
east
;
it
bring
rain
like
spray
,
and
sometimes
a
sharp
hail
,
like
shot
:
it
be
cold
and
pierce
me
to
the
vital
.
<EOS>
I
bend
my
head
to
meet
it
,
but
it
beat
me
back
.
<EOS>
My
heart
do
not
fail
at
all
in
this
conflict
;
I
only
wish
that
I
have
wing
and
could
ascend
the
gale
,
spread
and
repose
my
pinion
on
its
strength
,
career
in
its
course
,
sweep
where
it
sweep
.
<EOS>
while
wish
this
,
I
suddenly
feel
cold
where
before
I
be
cold
,
and
more
powerless
where
before
I
be
weak
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
reach
the
porch
of
a
great
building
near
,
but
the
mass
of
frontage
and
the
giant
spire
turn
black
and
vanish
from
my
eye
.
<EOS>
instead
of
sink
on
the
step
as
I
intend
,
I
seem
to
pitch
headlong
down
an
abyss
.
<EOS>
I
remember
no
more
.
    
<EOS>
AULD
LANG
SYNE
.
  
<EOS>
where
my
soul
go
during
that
swoon
I
can
not
tell
.
<EOS>
whatever
she
see
,
or
wherever
she
travel
in
her
trance
on
that
strange
night
she
keep
her
own
secret
;
never
whisper
a
word
to
memory
,
and
baffle
imagination
by
an
indissoluble
silence
.
<EOS>
She
may
have
go
upward
,
and
come
in
sight
of
her
eternal
home
,
hope
for
leave
to
rest
now
,
and
deem
that
her
painful
union
with
matter
be
at
last
dissolve
.
<EOS>
while
she
so
deem
,
an
angel
may
have
warn
her
away
from
heaven
's
threshold
,
and
,
guide
her
weeping
down
,
have
bind
her
,
once
more
,
all
shuddering
and
unwilling
,
to
that
poor
frame
,
cold
and
waste
,
of
whose
companionship
she
be
grow
more
than
weary
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
she
re
-
enter
her
prison
with
pain
,
with
reluctance
,
with
a
moan
and
a
long
shiver
.
<EOS>
the
divorce
mate
,
Spirit
and
Substance
,
be
hard
to
re
-
unite
:
they
greet
each
other
,
not
in
an
embrace
,
but
a
racking
sort
of
struggle
.
<EOS>
the
return
sense
of
sight
come
upon
me
,
red
,
as
if
it
swam
in
blood
;
suspend
hearing
rush
back
loud
,
like
thunder
;
consciousness
revive
in
fear
:
I
sit
up
appalled
,
wonder
into
what
region
,
amongst
what
strange
being
I
be
wake
.
<EOS>
at
first
I
know
nothing
I
look
on
:
a
wall
be
not
a
wall
 
<EOS>
a
lamp
not
a
lamp
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
understand
what
we
call
a
ghost
,
as
well
as
I
do
the
common
object
:
which
be
another
way
of
intimate
that
all
my
eye
rest
on
strike
it
as
spectral
.
<EOS>
but
the
faculty
soon
settle
each
in
his
place
;
the
life
-
machine
presently
resume
its
wonted
and
regular
working
.
  
<EOS>
still
,
I
know
not
where
I
be
;
only
in
time
I
see
I
have
be
remove
from
the
spot
where
I
fall
:
I
lie
on
no
portico
-
step
;
night
and
temp
be
exclude
by
wall
,
window
,
and
ceiling
.
<EOS>
into
some
house
I
have
be
carry
 
but
<EOS>
what
house
?
  
<EOS>
I
could
only
think
of
the
pensionnat
in
the
Rue
Fossette
.
<EOS>
still
half
-
dream
,
I
try
hard
to
discover
in
what
room
they
have
put
me
;
whether
the
great
dormitory
,
or
one
of
the
little
dormitory
.
<EOS>
I
be
puzzle
,
because
I
could
not
make
the
glimpse
of
furniture
I
see
accord
with
my
knowledge
of
any
of
these
apartment
.
<EOS>
the
empty
white
bed
be
want
,
and
the
long
line
of
large
window
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
surely
,
"
think
I
,
"
it
be
not
to
Madame
Beck
's
own
chamber
they
have
carry
me
!
"
<EOS>
and
here
my
eye
fall
on
an
easy
-
chair
cover
with
blue
damask
.
<EOS>
other
seat
,
cushion
to
match
,
dawn
on
me
by
degree
;
and
at
last
I
take
in
the
complete
fact
of
a
pleasant
parlour
,
with
a
wood
fire
on
a
clear
-
shine
hearth
,
a
carpet
where
arabesque
of
bright
blue
relieve
a
ground
of
shaded
fawn
;
pale
wall
over
which
a
slight
but
endless
garland
of
azure
forget
-
me
-
not
run
mazed
and
bewilder
amongst
myriad
gold
leave
and
tendril
.
<EOS>
a
gilded
mirror
fill
up
the
space
between
two
window
,
curtain
amply
with
blue
damask
.
<EOS>
in
this
mirror
I
see
myself
lay
,
not
in
bed
,
but
on
a
sofa
.
<EOS>
I
look
spectral
;
my
eye
large
and
more
hollow
,
my
hair
<EOS>
dark
than
be
natural
,
by
contrast
with
my
thin
and
ashen
face
.
<EOS>
It
be
obvious
,
not
only
from
the
furniture
,
but
from
the
position
of
window
,
door
,
and
fireplace
,
that
this
be
an
unknown
room
in
an
unknown
house
.
  
<EOS>
hardly
less
plain
be
it
that
my
brain
be
not
yet
settle
;
for
,
as
I
gaze
at
the
blue
arm
-
chair
,
it
appear
to
grow
familiar
;
so
do
a
certain
scroll
-
couch
,
and
<EOS>
not
less
so
the
round
centre
-
table
,
with
a
blue
-
covering
,
border
with
autumn
-
tint
foliage
;
and
,
above
all
,
two
little
footstool
with
work
cover
,
and
a
small
ebony
-
frame
chair
,
of
which
the
seat
and
back
be
also
work
with
group
of
brilliant
flower
on
a
dark
ground
.
  
<EOS>
strike
with
these
thing
,
I
explore
further
.
<EOS>
strange
to
say
,
old
acquaintance
be
all
about
me
,
and
"
auld
lang
syne
"
smile
out
of
every
nook
.
<EOS>
there
be
two
oval
miniature
over
the
mantel
-
piece
,
of
which
I
know
by
heart
the
pearl
about
the
high
and
powder
"
head
;
"
the
velvet
circle
the
white
throat
;
the
swell
of
the
full
muslin
kerchief
:
the
pattern
of
the
lace
sleeve
-
ruffle
.
<EOS>
upon
the
mantel
-
shelf
there
be
two
china
vase
,
some
relic
of
a
diminutive
tea
-
service
,
as
smooth
as
enamel
and
as
thin
as
egg
-
shell
,
and
a
white
centre
ornament
,
a
classic
group
in
alabaster
,
preserve
under
glass
.
<EOS>
of
all
these
thing
I
could
have
tell
the
peculiarity
,
number
the
flaw
or
crack
,
like
any
_
clairvoyante
_
.
<EOS>
above
all
,
there
be
a
pair
of
handscreens
,
with
elaborate
pencil
-
drawing
finish
like
line
engraving
;
these
,
my
very
eye
ache
at
behold
again
,
recall
hour
when
they
have
follow
,
stroke
by
stroke
and
touch
by
touch
,
a
tedious
,
feeble
,
finical
,
school

girl
pencil
hold
in
these
finger

now
so
skeleton

like
.
  
<EOS>
where
be
I
?
<EOS>
not
only
in
what
spot
of
the
world
,
but
in
what
year
of
our
Lord
?
<EOS>
for
all
these
object
be
of
past
day
,
and
of
a
distant
country
.
<EOS>
ten
year
ago
I
bade
them
good
-
by
;
since
my
fourteenth
year
they
and
I
have
never
meet
.
<EOS>
I
gasp
audibly
,
"
<EOS>
where
be
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
a
shape
hitherto
unnoticed
,
stir
,
rise
,
come
forward
:
a
shape
inharmonious
with
the
environment
,
serve
only
to
complicate
the
riddle
further
.
<EOS>
this
be
no
more
than
a
sort
of
native
bonne
,
in
a
common
-
place
bonne
's
cap
and
print
-
dress
.
<EOS>
She
speak
neither
French
nor
English
,
and
I
could
get
no
intelligence
from
her
,
not
understand
her
phrase
of
dialect
.
<EOS>
but
she
bathe
my
temple
and
forehead
with
some
cool
and
perfumed
water
,
and
then
she
heighten
the
cushion
on
which
I
recline
,
make
sign
that
I
be
not
to
speak
,
and
resume
her
post
at
the
foot
of
the
sofa
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
busy
knit
;
her
eye
thus
draw
from
me
,
I
could
gaze
on
her
without
interruption
.
<EOS>
I
do
mightily
wonder
how
she
come
there
,
or
what
she
could
have
to
do
among
the
scene
,
or
with
the
day
of
my
girlhood
.
<EOS>
still
more
I
marvel
what
those
scene
and
day
could
now
have
to
do
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
too
weak
to
scrutinize
thoroughly
the
mystery
,
I
try
to
settle
it
by
say
it
be
a
mistake
,
a
dream
,
a
fever
-
fit
;
and
yet
I
know
there
could
be
no
mistake
,
and
that
I
be
not
sleep
,
and
I
believe
I
be
sane
.
<EOS>
I
wish
the
room
have
not
be
so
well
light
,
that
I
may
not
so
clearly
have
see
the
little
picture
,
the
ornament
,
the
screen
,
the
work
chair
.
<EOS>
all
these
object
,
as
well
as
the
blue
-
damask
furniture
,
be
,
in
fact
,
precisely
the
same
,
in
every
minute
detail
,
with
those
I
so
well
remember
,
and
with
which
I
have
be
so
thoroughly
intimate
,
in
the
drawing
-
room
of
my
godmother
's
house
at
Bretton
.
<EOS>
Methought
the
apartment
only
be
change
,
be
of
different
proportion
and
dimension
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
of
Bedreddin
Hassan
,
transport
in
his
sleep
from
Cairo
to
the
gate
of
Damascus
.
<EOS>
have
a
Genius
stoop
his
dark
wing
down
the
storm
to
whose
stress
I
have
succumb
,
and
gather
me
from
the
church
-
step
,
and
"
rise
high
into
the
air
,
"
as
the
eastern
tale
say
,
<EOS>
have
he
borne
me
over
land
and
ocean
,
and
lay
me
quietly
down
beside
a
hearth
of
Old
England
?
<EOS>
but
no
<EOS>
;
I
know
the
fire
of
that
hearth
burn
before
its
lare
no
more
 
<EOS>
it
go
out
long
ago
,
and
the
household
god
have
be
carry
elsewhere
.
  
<EOS>
the
bonne
turn
again
to
survey
me
,
and
see
my
eye
wide
open
,
and
,
I
suppose
,
deem
their
expression
perturbed
and
excited
,
she
put
down
her
knitting
.
<EOS>
I
see
her
busied
for
a
moment
at
a
little
stand
;
she
pour
out
water
,
and
measure
drop
from
a
phial
:
glass
in
hand
,
she
approach
me
.
<EOS>
what
dark
-
tinge
draught
may
she
now
be
offer
?
<EOS>
what
Genii
-
elixir
or
Magi
-
distillation
?
  
<EOS>
It
be
too
late
to
inquire
 
<EOS>
I
have
swallow
it
passively
,
and
at
once
.
<EOS>
a
tide
of
quiet
thought
now
come
gently
caress
my
brain
;
soft
and
soft
rise
the
flow
,
with
tepid
undulation
smooth
than
balm
.
<EOS>
the
pain
of
weakness
leave
my
limb
,
my
muscle
sleep
.
<EOS>
I
lose
power
to
move
;
but
,
lose
at
the
same
time
wish
,
it
be
no
privation
.
<EOS>
that
kind
bonne
place
a
screen
between
me
and
the
lamp
;
I
see
her
rise
to
do
this
,
but
do
not
remember
see
her
resume
her
place
:
in
the
interval
between
the
two
act
,
I
"
fall
on
sleep
.
"
     
<EOS>
at
wake
,
lo
!
<EOS>
all
be
again
change

<EOS>
the
light
of
high
day
surround
me
;
not
,
indeed
,
a
warm
,
summer
light
,
but
the
leaden
gloom
of
raw
and
blustering
autumn
.
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
now
that
I
be
in
the
pensionnat
 
sure
by
the
beat
rain
on
the
casement
;
sure
by
the
"
wuther
"
of
wind
amongst
tree

denote
a

sure
by
the
chill
,
the
whiteness
,
the
solitude
,
amidst
which
I
lie
.
<EOS>
I
say
_
whiteness

for
the

drop

bound
my

I
lift
them
;
I

<EOS>
My

prepare

whitewash
chamber

blink

on

the

a

also

instead
of
five
wide

there
be
one
high

<EOS>
instead
of
two
dozen
little

there

this

<EOS>
reader
;
I
feel
alarmed
!
<EOS>
why
?
<EOS>
you
will
ask
.
<EOS>
what
be
there
in
this
simple
and
somewhat
pretty
sleeping
-
closet
to
startle
the
most
timid
?
<EOS>
merely
this
 
<EOS>
these
article
of

could
not
be
real

solid
arm

chair
,
look

glass
,

<EOS>
they
must
be
the
ghost
of
such
article
;
or
,
if
this
be
deny
as
too
wild
an
hypothesis
 
and
,
confound
as
I
be
,
I
_
do
_
deny
it
 
<EOS>
there
remain
but
to
conclude
that
I
have
myself
pass
into
an
abnormal
state
of
mind
;
in
short
,
that
I
be
very
ill
and
delirious
:
and
even
then
,
mine
be
the
strange
figment
with
which
delirium
have
ever
harass
a
victim
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
 
I
be
oblige
to
know
 
the
green
chintz
of
that
little
chair
;
the
little
snug

itself
,
the
carve

all
these
I
be
compel

to

I

Bretton

<EOS>
Bretton

<EOS>
and
ten
year
ago
shone
reflect
in

mirror

<EOS>
and
why
do
Bretton
and
my
fourteenth
year
haunt
me
thus
?
<EOS>
why
,
if
they
come
at
all
,
do
they
not
return
complete
?
<EOS>
why
hover
before
my
distemper
vision
the
mere
furniture
,
while
the
room
and
the
locality
be
go
?
<EOS>
as
to
that
pincushion
make
of
crimson
satin
,
ornament
with
gold

and
frille
with

lace

I
have
the

right

the

<EOS>
I
have
make
it
myself
.
<EOS>
rise
with
a
start
from
the
bed
,
I
take
the
cushion
in
my

and
examine
it
.
<EOS>
there
be

in
gold

,
and
surround
with
an
oval

embroider
in

<EOS>
these
be
the
initial
of
my
godmother
's
name
 
Lonisa
Lucy
Bretton
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
I
in
England
?
<EOS>
be
I
at
Bretton
?
<EOS>
"
I
mutter
;
and
hastily
pull
up
the
blind
with
which
the
lattice
be
shroud
,
I
look
out
to
try
and
discover
_
where
_
<EOS>
I
be
;
half
-
prepared
to
meet
the
calm
,
old
,
handsome
building
and
clean
grey
pavement
of
St.
Ann
's
Street
,
and
to
see
at
the
end
the
tower
of
the
minster
:
<EOS>
or
,
if
otherwise
,
fully
expectant
of
a
town
view
somewhere
,
a
rue
in
Villette
,
if
not
a
street
in
a
pleasant
and
ancient
english
city
.
  
<EOS>
I
look
,
on
the
contrary
,
through
a
frame
of
leafage
,
cluster
round
the
high
lattice
,
and
forth
thence
to
a
grassy
mead
-
like
level
,
a
lawn
-
terrace
with
tree
rise
from
the
low
ground
beyond
 
high
forest
-
tree
,
such
as
I
have
not
see
for
many
a
day
.
<EOS>
They
be
now
groan
under
the
gale
of
October
,
and
between
their
trunk
I
trace
the
line
of
an
avenue
,
where
yellow
leave
lie
in
heap
and
drift
,
or
be
whirl
singly
before
the
sweeping
west
wind
.
<EOS>
whatever
landscape
may
lie
further
must
have
be
flat
,
and
these
tall
beech
shut
it
out
.
<EOS>
the
place
seem
secluded
,
and
be
to
me
quite
strange
:
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
it
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
once
more
I
lie
down
.
<EOS>
My
bed
stand
in
a
little
alcove
;
on
turn
my
face
to
the
wall
,
the
room
with
its
bewilder
accompaniment
become
exclude
.
<EOS>
exclude
?
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
for
as
I
arrange
my
position
in
this
hope
,
behold
,
on
the
green
space
between
the
divide
and
loop
-
up
curtain
,
hang
a
broad
,
gild
picture
-
frame
enclose
a
portrait
.
<EOS>
It
be
draw
 
well
draw
,
though
but
a
sketch
 
in
water
-
colour
;
a
head
,
a
boy
's
head
,
fresh
,
life
-
like
,
speak
,
and
animate
.
<EOS>
It
seem
a
youth
of
sixteen
,
fair
-
complexioned
,
with
sanguine
health
in
his
cheek
;
hair
long
,
not
dark
,
and
with
a
sunny
sheen
;
penetrate
eye
,
an
arch
mouth
,
and
a
gay
smile
.
<EOS>
on
the
whole
a
most
pleasant
face
to
look
at
,
especially
for
,
those
claim
a
right
to
that
youth
's
affection
 
parent
,
for
instance
,
or
sister
.
<EOS>
any
romantic
little
school
-
girl
may
almost
have
love
it
in
its
frame
.
<EOS>
those
eye
look
as
if
when
somewhat
old
they
would
flash
a
lightning
-
response
to
love
:
I
can
not
tell
whether
they
keep
in
store
the
steady
-
beam
shine
of
faith
.
<EOS>
for
whatever
sentiment
meet
him
in
form
too
facile
,
his
lip
menace
,
beautifully
but
surely
,
caprice
and
light
esteem
.
  
<EOS>
strive
to
take
each
new
discovery
as
quietly
as
I
could
,
I
whisper
to
myself
    
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
that
portrait
use
to
hang
in
the
breakfast
-
room
,
over
the
mantel
-
piece
:
somewhat
too
high
,
as
I
think
.
<EOS>
I
well
remember
how
I
use
to
mount
a
music
-
stool
for
the
purpose
of
unhook
it
,
hold
it
in
my
hand
,
and
search
into
those
bonny
well
of
eye
,
whose
glance
under
their
hazel
lash
seem
like
a
pencilled
laugh
;
and
well
I
like
to
note
the
colouring
of
the
cheek
,
and
the
expression
of
the
mouth
.
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
believe
fancy
could
improve
on
the
curve
of
that
mouth
,
or
of
the
chin
;
even
_
my
_
ignorance
know
that
both
be
beautiful
,
and
ponder
perplex
over
this
doubt
:
<EOS>
"
how
it
be
that
what
charm
so
much
,
could
at
the
same
time
so
keenly
pain
?
"
<EOS>
once
,
by
way
of
test
,
I
take
little
Missy
Home
,
and
,
lift
her
in
my
arm
,
tell
her
to
look
at
the
picture
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
like
it
,
Polly
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
<EOS>
She
never
answer
,
but
gaze
long
,
and
at
last
a
darkness
go
tremble
through
her
sensitive
eye
,
as
she
say
,
"
put
me
down
.
"
<EOS>
so
I
put
her
down
,
say
to
myself
:
"
the
child
feel
it
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
all
these
thing
do
I
now
think
over
,
add
,
"
He
have
his
fault
,
yet
scarce
ever
be
a
fine
nature
;
liberal
,
suave
,
impressible
.
<EOS>
"
My
reflection
close
in
an
audibly
pronounce
word
,
"
Graham
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Graham
!
"
echo
a
sudden
voice
at
the
bedside
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
want
Graham
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
look
.
<EOS>
the
plot
be
but
thicken
;
the
wonder
but
culminate
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
strange
to
see
that
well
-
remember
picture
form
on
the
wall
,
still
strange
be
it
to
turn
and
behold
the
equally
well
-
remember
living
form
opposite
 
<EOS>
a
woman
,
a
lady
,
most
real
and
substantial
,
tall
,
well
-
attire
,
wear
widow
's
silk
,
and
such
a
cap
as
good
become
her
matron
and
motherly
braid
of
hair
.
<EOS>
her
,
too
,
be
a
good
face
;
too
marked
,
perhaps
,
now
for
beauty
,
but
not
for
sense
or
character
.
<EOS>
She
be
little
changed
;
something
sterner
,
something
more
robust
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
my
godmother
:
still
the
distinct
vision
of
Mrs.
Bretton
.
  
<EOS>
I
keep
quiet
,
yet
internally
_
I
_
be
much
agitate
:
my
pulse
flutter
,
and
the
blood
leave
my
cheek
,
which
turn
cold
.
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
where
be
I
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
a
very
safe
asylum
;
well
protect
for
the
present
;
make
your
mind
quite
easy
till
you
get
a
little
well
;
you
look
ill
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
entirely
bewilder
,
I
do
not
know
whether
I
can
trust
my
sense
at
all
,
or
whether
they
be
mislead
me
in
every
particular
:
but
you
speak
English
,
do
you
not
,
madam
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
you
may
hear
that
:
it
would
puzzle
me
to
hold
a
long
discourse
in
French
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
come
from
England

<EOS>

I

<EOS>

do

<EOS>
perhaps
I
do

Your

the

"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
his
portrait
as
a
youth

<EOS>
while
look
at
it

you
pronounce
his
name

"
  
<EOS>
"
Graham
Bretton

"
  
<EOS>
She
nod
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
speak
to
Mrs.
Bretton
,
formerly
of
Bretton
,
shire
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
quite
right
;
and
you

I

you
as
such

<EOS>
"
how
be
I
find
,
madam

and
by
whom

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
son
shall
tell
you
that
by
-
and
-
by
,
"
say
she
;
"
but
at
present
you
be
too
confused
and
weak
for
conversation
:
try
to
eat
some
breakfast
,
and
then
sleep
.
"
  
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
I
have
undergo
 
the
bodily
fatigue
,
the
perturbation
of
spirit
,
the
exposure
to
weather
 
<EOS>
it
seem
that
I
be
well
:
<EOS>
the
fever
,
the
real
malady
which
have
oppress
my
frame
,
be
abate
;
for
,
whereas
during
the
last
nine
day
I
have
take
no
solid
food
,
and
suffer
from
continual
thirst
,
this
morning
,
on
breakfast
be
offer
,
I
experience
a
craving
for
nourishment
:
an
inward
faintness
which
cause
me
eagerly
to
taste
the
tea
this
lady
offer
,
and
to
eat
the
morsel
of
dry
toast
she
allow
in
accompaniment
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
a
morsel
,
but
it
suffice
;
keep
up
my
strength
till
some
two
or
three
hour
afterwards
,
when
the
bonne
bring
me
a
little
cup
of
broth
and
a
biscuit
.
  
<EOS>
as
evening
begin
to
darken
,
and
the
ceaseless
blast
still
blow
wild
and
cold
,
and
the
rain
stream
on
,
deluge
-
like
<EOS>
,
I
grow
weary
 
very
weary
of
my
bed
.
<EOS>
the
room
,
though
pretty
,
be
small
:
I
feel
it
confine
:
I
long
for
a
change
.
<EOS>
the
increase
chill
and
gathering
gloom
,
too
,
depress
me
;
I
want
to
see
 
to
feel
firelight
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
keep
think
of
the
son
of
that
tall
matron
:
when
should
I
see
him
?
<EOS>
certainly
not
till
I
leave
my
room
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
the
bonne
come
to
make
my
bed
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
She
prepare
to
wrap
me
in
a
blanket
and
place
me
in
the
little
chintz
chair
;
but
,
decline
these
attention
,
I
proceed
to
dress
myself
:
  
<EOS>
the
business
be
just
achieve
,
and
I
be
sit
down
to
take
breath
,
when
Mrs.
Bretton
once
more
appear
.
  
<EOS>
"
dress
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaim
,
smile
with
that
smile
<EOS>
I
so
well
know
 
a
pleasant
smile
,
though
not
soft
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
quite
well
then
?
<EOS>
quite
strong
 
eh
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
speak
to
me
so
much
as
of
old
she
use
to
speak
that
I
almost
fancy
she
be
begin
to
know
me
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
same
sort
of
patronage
in
her
voice
and
manner
that
,
as
a
girl
,
I
have
always
experience
from
her
 
a
patronage
I
yield
to
and
even
like
;
it
be
not
found
on
conventional
ground
of
superior
wealth
or
station
(
in
the
last
particular
there
have
never
be
any
inequality
;
her
degree
be
mine
)
;
but
on
natural
reason
of
physical
advantage
:
it
be
the
shelter
the
tree
give
the
herb
.
<EOS>
I
put
a
request
without
further
ceremony
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
let
me
go
down
-
stair
,
madam
;
I
be
so
cold
and
dull
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
desire
nothing
better
,
if
you
be
strong
enough
to
bear
the
change
,
"
be
her
reply
.
<EOS>
"
come
then
;
here
be
an
arm
.
"
<EOS>
and
she
offer
me
her
<EOS>
:
I
take
it
,
and
we
descend
one
flight
of
carpet
step
to
a
landing
where
a
tall
door
,
stand
open
,
give
admission
into
the
blue
-
damask
room
.
<EOS>
how
pleasant
it
be
in
its
air
of
perfect
domestic
comfort
!
<EOS>
how
warm
in
its
amber
lamp
-
light
and
vermilion
fire
-
flush
!
<EOS>
to
render
the
picture
perfect
,
tea
stand
ready
on
the
table
 
an
english
tea
,
whereof
the
whole
shine
service
glance
at
me
familiarly
;
from
the
solid
silver
urn
,
of
antique
pattern
,
and
the
massive
pot
of
the
same
metal
,
to
the
thin
porcelain
cup
,
dark
with
purple
and
gilding
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
very
seed
-
cake
of
peculiar
form
,
bake
in
a
peculiar
mould
,
which
always
have
a
place
on
the
tea
-
table
at
Bretton
.
<EOS>
Graham
like
it
,
and
there
it
be
as
of
yore
 
set
before
Graham
's
plate
with
the
silver
knife
and
fork
beside
it
.
<EOS>
Graham
be
then
expect
to
tea
:
<EOS>
Graham
be
now
,
perhaps
,
in
the
house
;
ere
many
minute
I
may
see
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
sit
down
 
sit
down
,
"
say
my
conductress
,
as
my
step
falter
a
little
in
pass
to
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
She
seat
me
on
the
sofa
,
but
I
soon
pass
behind
it
,
say
the
fire
be
too
hot
;
in
its
shade
I
find
another
seat
which
suit
me
better
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
be
never
will
not
to
make
a
fuss
about
any
person
or
anything
;
without
remonstrance
she
suffer
me
to
have
my
own
way
.
<EOS>
She
make
the
tea
,
and
she
take
up
the
newspaper
.
<EOS>
I
like
to
watch
every
action
of
my
godmother
;
all
her
movement
be
so
young
:
she
must
have
be
now
above
fifty
,
yet
neither
her
sinews
nor
her
spirit
seem
yet
touch
by
the
rust
of
age
.
<EOS>
though
portly
,
she
be
alert
,
and
though
serene
,
she
be
at
time
impetuous
 
<EOS>
good
health
and
an
excellent
temperament
keep
her
green
as
in
her
spring
.
  
<EOS>
while
she
read
,
I
perceive
she
listen
 
listen
for
her
son
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
the
woman
ever
to
confess
herself
uneasy
,
but
there
be
yet
no
lull
in
the
weather
,
and
if
Graham
be
out
in
that
hoarse
wind
 
<EOS>
roar
still
unsatisfied
 
<EOS>
I
well
know
his
mother
's
heart
would
be
out
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
ten
minute
behind
his
time
,
"
say
she
,
look
at
her
watch
;
then
,
in
another
minute
,
a
lifting
of
her
eye
from
the
page
,
and
a
slight
inclination
of
her
head
towards
the
door
,
denote
that
she
hear
some
sound
.
<EOS>
presently
her
brow
clear
;
and
then
even
my
ear
,
less
practised
,
catch
the
iron
clash
of
a
gate
swing
to
<EOS>
,
step
on
gravel
,
lastly
the
door
-
bell
.
<EOS>
He
be
come
.
<EOS>
His
mother
fill
the
teapot
from
the
urn
,
she
draw
nearer
the
hearth
<EOS>
the
stuff
and
cushion
blue
chair
 
<EOS>
her
own
chair
by
right
,
<EOS>
but
I
see
there
be
one
who
may
with
impunity
<EOS>
usurp
it
.
<EOS>
and
when
that
_
one
_
come
up
the
stair
 
which
he
soon
do
,
after
,
I
suppose
,
some
such
attention
to
the
toilet
as
the
wild
and
wet
night
render
necessary
,
and
strode
straight
in
    
<EOS>
"
be
it
you
,
Graham
?
"
say
his
mother
,
hide
a
glad
smile
and
speak
curtly
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
else
should
it
be
,
mamma
?
"
<EOS>
demand
the
Unpunctual
,
possess
himself
irreverently
of
the
abdicate
throne
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
deserve
cold
tea
,
for
be
late

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
get
my
desert

cheerily

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
wheel
yourself
to
the
table
,
lazy
boy
:
<EOS>
no
seat
will
serve
you
but
mine
;
if
you
have
one
spark
of
a
sense
of
propriety
,
you
would
always
leave
that
chair
for
the
Old
Lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
should
;
only
the
dear
Old
Lady
persist
in
leave
it
for
me
.
<EOS>
how
be
your
patient
,
mamma
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
she
come
forward
and
speak
for
herself
?
"
say
Mrs.
Bretton
,
turn
to
my
corner
;
and
at
this
invitation
,
forward
I
come
.
<EOS>
Graham
courteously
rise
up
to
greet
me
.
<EOS>
He
stand
tall
on
the
hearth
,
a
figure
justify
his
mother
's
unconcealed
pride
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
you
be
come
down
,
"
say
he
;
"
you
must
be
well
then
 
much
better
.
<EOS>
I
scarcely
expect
we
should
meet
thus
,
or
here
.
<EOS>
I
be
alarm
last
night
,
and
if
I
have
not
be
force
to
hurry
away
to
a
die
patient
,
I
certainly
would
not
have
leave
you
;
but
my
mother
herself
be
something
of
a
doctress
,
and
Martha
an
excellent
nurse
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
case
be
a
fainting
-
fit
,
not
necessarily
dangerous
.
<EOS>
what
bring
it
on
,
I
have
yet
to
learn
,
and
all
particular
;
meantime
,
I
trust
you
really
do
feel
well
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
much
well
,
"
I
say
calmly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
much
better

I
thank
you
,
Dr.

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
for
,
reader
,
this
tall
young
man
 
<EOS>
this
darle
son
 
<EOS>
this
host
of
mine
 
<EOS>
this
Graham
Bretton
,
_
be
_
<EOS>
Dr.
John
:
he
,
and
no
other
;
and
<EOS>
,
what
be
more
,
I
ascertain
this
identity
scarcely
with
surprise
.
<EOS>
what
be
more
,
when
I
hear
Graham
's
step
on
the
stair
,
I
know
what
manner
of
figure
would
enter
,
and
for
whose
aspect
to
prepare
my
eye
.
<EOS>
the
discovery
be
not
of
to
-
day
,
its
dawn
have
penetrate
my
perception
long
since
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
remember
young
Bretton
well
;
and
though
ten
year
(
from
sixteen
to
twenty
-
six
)
may
greatly
change
the
boy
as
they
mature
him
to
the
man
,
yet
they
could
bring
no
such
utter
difference
as
would
suffice
wholly
to
blind
my
eye
,
or
baffle
my
memory
.
<EOS>
Dr.
John
Graham
Bretton
retain
still
an
affinity
to
the
youth
of
sixteen
:
he
have
his
eye
;
he
have
some
of
his
feature
;
to
wit
,
all
the
excellently
-
mould
low
half
of
the
face
;
I
find
him
out
soon
.
<EOS>
I
first
recognise
him
on
that
occasion
,
note
several
chapter
back
,
when
my
unguardedly
-
fix
attention
have
draw
on
me
the
mortification
of
an
implied
rebuke
.
<EOS>
subsequent
observation
confirm
,
in
every
point
,
that
early
surmise
.
<EOS>
I
trace
in
the
gesture
,
the
port
,
and
the
habit
of
his
manhood
,
all
his
boy
's
promise
.
<EOS>
I
hear
in
his
now
deep
tone
the
accent
of
former
day
.
<EOS>
certain
turn
of
phrase
,
peculiar
to
him
of
old
,
be
peculiar
to
him
still
;
and
so
be
many
a
trick
of
eye
and
lip
,
<EOS>
many
a
smile
,
many
a
sudden
ray
level
from
the
irid
,
under
his
well
-
character
brow
.
  
<EOS>
to
_
say
_
anything
on
the
subject
,
to
_
hint
_
<EOS>
at
my
discovery
,
have
not
suit
my
habit
of
thought
,
or
assimilate
with
my
system
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
I
have
prefer
to
keep
the
matter
to
myself
.
<EOS>
I
like
enter
his
presence
cover
with
a
cloud
he
have
not
see
through
,
while
he
stand
before
me
under
a
ray
of
special
illumination
which
shine
all
partial
over
his
head
,
tremble
about
his
foot
,
and
cast
light
no
farther
.
  
<EOS>
well
I
know
that
to
him
it
could
make
little
difference
,
be
I
to
come
forward
and
announce
,
"
this
be
Lucy
Snowe
!
"
<EOS>
so
I
keep
back
in
my
teacher
's
place
;
and
as
he
never
ask
my
name
,
so
I
never
give
it
.
<EOS>
He
hear
me
call
"
Miss
,
"
and
"
Miss
Lucy
;
"
he
never
hear
the
surname
,
"
Snowe
.
"
<EOS>
as
to
spontaneous
recognition
 
though
I
,
perhaps
,
be
still
less
changed
than
he
 
<EOS>
the
idea
never
approach
his
mind
,
and
why
should
I
suggest
it
?
  
<EOS>
during
tea
,
Dr.
John
be
kind
,
as
it
be
his
nature
to
be
;
that
meal
over
,
and
the
tray
carry
out
,
he
make
a
cosy
arrangement
of
the
cushion
in
a
corner
of
the
sofa
,
and
oblige
me
to
settle
amongst
them
.
<EOS>
He
and
his
mother
also
draw
to
the
fire
,
and
ere
<EOS>
we
have
sit
ten
minute
<EOS>
,
I
catch
the
eye
of
the
latter
fasten
steadily
upon
me
.
<EOS>
woman
be
certainly
quick
in
some
thing
than
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
she
exclaim
,
presently
,
"
I
have
seldom
see
a
strong
likeness
!
<EOS>
Graham
,
have
you
observe
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
observe
what
?
<EOS>
what
ail
the
Old
Lady
now
?
<EOS>
how
you
stare
,
mamma
!
<EOS>
one
would
think
you
have
an
attack
of
second
sight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
tell
me
,
Graham
,
of
whom
do
that
young
lady
remind
you
?
"
<EOS>
point
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mamma
,
you
put
her
out
of
countenance
.
<EOS>
I
often
tell
you
abruptness
be
your
fault
;
remember
,
too
,
that
to
you
she
be
a
stranger
,
and
do
not
know
your
way
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
when
she
look
down
;
now
,
when
she
turn
sideways
,
who
be
she
like
,
Graham
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
mamma
,
since
you
propound
the
riddle
,
I
think
you
ought
to
solve
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
have
know
her
some
time
,
you
say
 
ever
since
you
first
begin
to
attend
the
school
in
the
Rue
Fossette
:
 
<EOS>
yet
you
never
mention
to
me
that
singular
resemblance
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
mention
a
thing
of
which
I
never
think
,
and
which
I
do
not
now
acknowledge
.
<EOS>
what
_
<EOS>
can
_
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
stupid
boy
!
<EOS>
look
at
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Graham
do
look
:
but
this
be
not
to
be
endure
;
I
see
how
it
must
end
,
so
I
think
it
best
to
anticipate
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dr.
John
,
"
I
say
,
"
have
have
so
much
to
do
and
think
of
,
since
he
and
I
shake
hand
at
our
last
parting
in
St.
Ann
's
Street
,
that
,
while
I
readily
find
out
Mr.
Graham
Bretton
,
some
month
ago
,
it
never
occur
to
me
as
possible
that
he
should
recognise
Lucy
Snowe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
Snowe
!
<EOS>
I
think
so
!
<EOS>
I
know
it
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Mrs.
Bretton
.
<EOS>
and
she
at
once
step
across
the
hearth
and
kiss
me
.
<EOS>
some
lady
would
,
perhaps
,
have
make
a
great
bustle
upon
such
a
discovery
without
be
particularly
glad
of
it
;
but
it
be
not
my
godmother
's
habit
to
make
a
bustle
,
and
she
prefer
all
sentimental
demonstration
in
bas
-
relief
.
<EOS>
so
she
and
I
get
over
the
surprise
with
few
word
and
a
single
salute
;
yet
I
daresay
she
be
pleased
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
I
be
.
<EOS>
while
we
renew
old
acquaintance
,
Graham
,
sit
opposite
,
silently
disposed
of
his
paroxysm
of
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mamma
call
me
a
stupid
boy
,
and
I
think
I
be
so
,
"
at
length
he
say
;
"
for
,
upon
my
honour
,
often
as
I
have
see
you
,
I
never
once
suspect
this
fact
:
<EOS>
and
yet
I
perceive
it
all
now
.
<EOS>
Lucy
Snowe
!
<EOS>
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
I
recollect
her
perfectly
,
and
there
she
sit
;
not
a
doubt
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
,
"
he
add
,
"
you
surely
have
not
know
me
as
an
old
acquaintance
all
this
time
,
and
never
mention
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
I
have
,
"
be
my
answer
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
John
comment
not
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
regard
my
silence
as
eccentric
,
but
he
be
indulgent
in
refrain
from
censure
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
,
too
,
he
would
have
deem
it
impertinent
to
have
interrogate
me
very
closely
,
to
have
ask
me
the
why
and
wherefore
of
my
reserve
;
and
,
though
he
may
feel
a
little
curious
,
the
importance
of
the
case
be
by
no
mean
such
as
to
tempt
curiosity
to
infringe
on
discretion
.
  
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
just
venture
to
inquire
whether
he
remember
the
circumstance
of
my
once
look
at
him
very
fixedly
;
for
the
slight
annoyance
he
have
betray
on
that
occasion
still
linger
sore
on
my
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
do
!
"
<EOS>
say
he
:
"
<EOS>
I
think
I
be
even
cross
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
consider
me
a
little
bold
;
perhaps
?
"
I
inquire
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
only
,
shy
and
retire
as
your
general
manner
be
,
I
wonder
what
personal
or
facial
enormity
in
me
prove
so
magnetic
to
your
usually
avert
eye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
how
it
be
now
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
perfectly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
here
Mrs.
Bretton
break
in
with
many
,
many
question
about
past
time
;
and
for
her
satisfaction
I
have
to
recur
to
go
-
by
trouble
,
to
explain
cause
of
seem
estrangement
,
to
touch
on
single
-
handed
conflict
with
Life
,
with
death
,
with
Grief
,
with
Fate
.
<EOS>
Dr.
John
listen
,
say
little
.
<EOS>
He
and
she
then
tell
me
of
change
they
have
know
:
even
with
them
all
have
not
go
smoothly
,
and
fortune
have
retrench
her
once
abundant
gift
.
<EOS>
but
so
courageous
a
mother
,
with
such
a
champion
in
her
son
,
be
well
fit
to
fight
a
good
fight
with
the
world
,
and
to
prevail
ultimately
.
<EOS>
Dr.
John
himself
be
one
of
those
on
whose
birth
benign
planet
have
certainly
smile
.
<EOS>
adversity
may
set
against
him
her
most
sullen
front
:
he
be
the
man
to
beat
her
down
with
smile
.
<EOS>
strong
and
cheerful
,
and
firm
and
courteous
;
not
rash
,
yet
valiant
;
he
be
the
aspirant
to
woo
Destiny
herself
,
and
to
win
from
her
stone
eyeball
a
beam
almost
loving
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
profession
he
have
adopt
,
his
success
be
now
quite
decide
.
<EOS>
within
the
last
three
month
he
have
take
this
house
(
a
small
château
,
they
tell
me
,
about
half
a
league
without
the
Porte
de
Crécy
)
;
this
country
site
be
choose
for
the
sake
of
his
mother
's
health
,
with
which
town
air
do
not
now
agree
.
<EOS>
hither
he
have
invite
Mrs.
Bretton
,
and
she
,
on
leave
England
,
have
bring
with
her
such
residue
furniture
of
the
former
St.
Ann
's
Street
mansion
as
she
have
think
fit
to
keep
unsold
.
<EOS>
hence
my
bewilderment
at
the
phantom
of
chair
,
and
the
wraith
of
looking
-
glass
,
tea
-
urn
,
and
teacup
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
clock
strike
eleven
,
Dr.
John
stop
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Snowe
must
retire
now
,
"
he
say
;
"
she
be
begin
to
look
very
pale
.
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
I
will
venture
to
put
some
question
respect
the
cause
of
her
loss
of
health
.
<EOS>
She
be
much
changed
,
indeed
,
since
last
July
,
when
I
see
her
enact
with
no
little
spirit
the
part
of
a
very
kill
fine
gentleman
.
<EOS>
as
to
last
night
's
catastrophe
,
I
be
sure
thereby
hang
a
tale
,
but
we
will
inquire
no
further
this
evening
.
<EOS>
good
-
night
,
Miss
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
he
kindly
lead
me
to
the
door
,
and
hold
a
wax
-
candle
,
light
me
up
the
one
flight
of
stair
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
have
say
my
prayer
,
and
when
I
be
undress
and
lay
down
,
I
feel
that
I
still
have
friend
.
<EOS>
friend
,
not
profess
vehement
attachment
,
not
offer
the
tender
solace
of
well
-
match
and
congenial
relationship
;
on
whom
,
therefore
,
but
moderate
demand
of
affection
be
to
be
make
,
of
whom
but
moderate
expectation
form
;
but
towards
whom
my
heart
soften
instinctively
,
and
yearn
with
an
importunate
gratitude
,
which
I
entreat
reason
betime
to
check
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
let
me
think
of
them
too
often
,
too
much
,
too
fondly
,
"
I
implore
:
"
let
me
be
content
with
a
temperate
draught
of

Her

I

that

suffer
a
good

in

<EOS>
further
,
on
this
subject
,
I
do
not
consider
it
advisable

for
the
detail
of
what
I
have
undergo
belong
to
a
portion
of
my
existence
in
which
I
never
expect
my
godmother

take
a

<EOS>
into
what
a
new
region
would
such
a
confidence
have
lead
that
hale

serene
nature

<EOS>
the
difference
between
her
and
me
may
be
figure
by
that
between
the
stately
ship
cruise
safe
on
smooth
sea
,
with
its
full
complement
of
crew
,
a
captain
gay
and
brave
,
and
venturous
and
provident
;
and
the
life

boat
,
which
most
day
of
the

lie
dry
and
solitary
in
an
old
,
dark
boat
-
house
,
only
put
to
sea
when
the
billow
run
high
in
rough
weather
,
when
cloud
encounter
water
,
when
danger
and
death
divide
between
them
the
rule
of
the
great
deep
.
<EOS>
no
,
the
"
Louisa

never
be
out
of
harbour
on
such
a
night
,
and
in
such
a
scene
:
her
crew
could
not
conceive
it
;
so
the
half

drown
life
-
boat
man
keep
his
own
counsel
,
and
spin
no
yarn
.
  
<EOS>
She
leave
me
,
and
I
lie
in
bed
content
:
it
be
good
of
Graham
to
remember
me
before
he
go
out
.
  
<EOS>
My
day
be
lonely
,
but
the
prospect
of
come
evening
abridge
and
cheer
it
.
<EOS>
then
,
too
,
I
feel
weak
,
and
rest
seem
welcome
;
and
after
the
morning
hour
be
go
by
,
 
those
hour
which
always
bring
,
even
to
the
necessarily
unoccupied
,
a
sense
of
business
to
be
do
,
of
task
wait
fulfilment
,
a
vague
impression
of
obligation
to
be
employ
 
when
this
stirring
time
be
past
,
and
the
silent
descent
of
afternoon
hush
housemaid
step
on
the
stair
and
in
the
chamber
,
I
then
pass
into
a
dreamy
mood
,
not
unpleasant
.
  
<EOS>
My
calm
little
room
seem
somehow
like
a
cave
in
the
sea
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
colour
about
it
,
except
that
white
and
pale
green
,
suggestive
of
foam
and
deep
water
;
the
blanch
cornice
be
adorn
with
shell
-
shape
ornament
,
and
there
be
white
moulding
like
dolphin
in
the
ceiling
-
angle
.
<EOS>
even
that
one
touch
of
colour
visible
in
the
red
satin
pincushion
bore
affinity
to
coral
;
even
that
dark
,
shine
glass
may
have
mirror
a
mermaid
.
<EOS>
when
I
close
my
eye
,
I
hear
a
gale
,
subside
at
last
,
bear
upon
the
house
-
front
like
a
settling
swell
upon
a
rock
-
base
.
<EOS>
I
hear
it
draw
and
withdraw
far
,
far
off
,
like
a
tide
retire
from
a
shore
of
the
upper
world
 
a
world
so
high
above
that
the
rush
of
its
large
wave
,
the
dash
of
its
fierce
breaker
,
could
sound
down
in
this
submarine
home
,
only
like
murmur
and
a
lullaby
.
  
<EOS>
amidst
these
dream
come
evening
,
and
then
Martha
bring
a
light
;
with
her
aid
I
be
quickly
dress
,
and
strong
now
than
in
the
morning
,
I
make
my
way
down
to
the
blue
saloon
unassiste
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
John
,
it
appear
,
have
conclude
his
round
of
professional
call
earlier
than
usual
;
his
form
be
the
first
object
that
meet
my
eye
as
I
enter
the
parlour
;
he
stand
in
that
window
-
recess
opposite
the
door
,
read
the
close
type
of
a
newspaper
by
such
dull
light
as
closing
day
yet
give
.
<EOS>
the
fire
shine
clear
,
but
the
lamp
stand
on
the
table
unlit
,
and
tea
be
not
yet
bring
up
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
Mrs.
Bretton
,
my
active
godmother
 
<EOS>
who
,
I
afterwards
find
,
have
be
out
in
the
open
air
all
day
 
lie
half
-
recline
in
her
deep

cushion
chair
,
actually
lose
in
a
nap
.
<EOS>
Her
son
see
me
,
come
forward
.
<EOS>
I
notice
that
he
tread
carefully
,
not
to
wake
the
sleeper
;
he
also
speak
low
:
his
mellow
voice
never
have
any
sharpness
in
it
;
modulate
as
at
present
,
it
be
calculate
rather
to
soothe
than
startle
slumber
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
quiet
little
château
,
"
he
observe
,
after
invite
me
to
sit
near
the
casement
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
whether
you
may
have
notice
it
in
your
walk
:
though
,
indeed
,
from
the
chaussée
it
be
not
visible
;
just
a
mile
beyond
the
Porte
de
Crécy
,
you
turn
down
a
lane
which
soon
become
an
avenue
,
and
that
lead
you
on
,
through
meadow
and
shade
,
to
the
very
door
of
this
house
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
modern
place
,
but
build
somewhat
in
the
old
style
of
the
Basse

Ville
.
<EOS>
It
be
rather
a
manoir
than
a
château
;
they
call
it
"
La
Terrasse
,
"
because
its
front
rise
from
a
broad
turfed
walk
,
whence
step
lead
down
a
grassy
slope
to
the
avenue
.
<EOS>
see
yonder

<EOS>
the

rise
:
she
look
well
through
the
tree

bole

<EOS>
where
,
indeed
,
do
the
moon
not
look
well
?
<EOS>
what
be
the
scene
,
confine
or
expansive
,
which
her
orb
do
not
hallow
?
<EOS>
rosy
or
fiery
<EOS>
,
she
mount
now
above
a
not
distant
bank
;
even
while
we
watch
her
flushed
ascent
,
she
clear
to
gold
,
and
in
very
brief
space
,
float
up
stainless
into
a
now
calm
sky
.
<EOS>
do
moonlight
soften
or
sadden
Dr.
Bretton
?
<EOS>
do
it
touch
him
with
romance
?
<EOS>
I
think
it
do
.
<EOS>
albeit
of
no
sigh
mood
,
he
sigh
in
watch
it
:
sighed
to
himself
quietly
.
<EOS>
no
need
to
ponder
the
cause
or
the
course
of
that
sigh
<EOS>
;
I
know
it
be
waken
by
beauty
;
I
know
it
pursue
Ginevra
.
<EOS>
know
this
,
the
idea
press
upon
me
that
it
be
in
some
sort
my
duty
to
speak
the
name
he
meditate
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
be
ready
for
the
subject
:
I
see
in
his
countenance
a
teem
plenitude
of
comment
,
question
and
interest
;
a
pressure
of
language
and
sentiment
,
only
check
,
I
think
,
by
sense
of
embarrassment
how
to
begin
.
<EOS>
to
spare
him
this
embarrassment
be
my
good
,
indeed
my
sole
use
.
<EOS>
I
have
but
to
utter
the
idol
's
name
,
and
love
's
tender
litany
would
flow
out
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
find
a
fitting
phrase
,
"
You
know
that
Miss
Fanshawe
be
go
on
a
tour
with
the
Cholmondeleys

"
and
be
open
my

scatter
my

by
introduce
another

<EOS>
"
the

this

,
"
say
he
,
put
his
sentiment
in
his
pocket
,
turn
from
the
moon
,
and
sit
down
,
"
<EOS>
I
go
to
the
Rue
Fossette
,
and
tell
the
cuisinière
that
you
be
safe
and
in
good
hand
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
that
I
actually
find
that
she
have
not

discover
your
absence
from

she

you
safe

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh

<EOS>
all
that

I.
"
Goton

do
nothing

bring
me
a

I

be

all

on
a
case
of
singularly
interesting
and
critical
character
;
the
disease
be
rare
,
and
its
treatment
doubtful
<EOS>
:
I
see
a
similar
and
still
fine
case
in
a
hospital
in
Paris
;
but
that
will
not

you

at

I

out
homeward

My

way
lie
through

Basse

Ville

and
as
the
night
be
excessively
dark

wet
<EOS>
,
I
take
it
.
<EOS>
in
ride
past

I
see
by
a
lamp
burn
over
the
porch

deep
arch
of
the
entrance
,
a
priest
lift
some
object
in
his
arm
.
<EOS>
the
lamp
be
bright
enough
to
reveal
the
priest
's
feature
clearly
,
and
I
recognise
him
;
he
be
a
man
I
have
often
meet
by
the
sick
bed
of
both
rich
and
poor
:
and
chiefly
the
latter
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
I
think
,
a
good
old
man
,
far
better
than
most
of
his
class
in
this
country
;
superior
,
indeed
,
in

better
inform

as
well

more
devoted

duty

<EOS>
Our
eye
meet

he
call
on
me
to
stop
:

what
he
support

fainting

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

awful
crime
,
no

he
do
not
tell
me
what
:
there
,
you
know

the
seal
of
the

check
his
garrulity

my
curiosity

<EOS>
Your
confidence
,
however
,
have
not
make
an
enemy
of
the
good
father

it
seem
he
be
so
strike
,
and
feel
so
sorry
that
you
should
be
out
on
such
a
night
alone
,
that
he
have
esteem
it
a
christian
duty
to
watch
you
when
you
quit
the
church

and
so
to
manage
as
not
to
lose
sight
of
you
,
till
you
should
have
reach
home

<EOS>
perhaps
the
worthy
man
may
,
half
unconsciously
,
have
blent
in
this
proceed
some
little
of
the
subtlety
of
his

it
may
have
be
his
resolve

learn
the
locality

you
impart
that
in

I
do
not

as

my

Dr.

I
suppose

me
mad
for

such
a
step

I
could

it

you
call

I
can
not
put
the
case
into
word
,
but
my
day
and
night
be
grow
intolerable
:
a
cruel
sense
of
desolation

my
mind

a
feeling
that
would
make
its

rush
out

actually
think
I
be
sting
with

of
jealous

similar
to

"
  
<EOS>
I
get
up
,
and
leave
the
room
very
much
excited
.
  
<EOS>
this
little
scene
take
place
in
the
morning
;
I
have
to
meet
him
again
in
the
evening
,
and
then
I
see
I
have
do
mischief
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
make
of
common
clay
,
not
put
together
out
of
vulgar
material
;
while
the
outline
of
his
nature
have
be
shape
with
breadth
and
vigour
,
the
detail
embrace
workmanship
of
almost
feminine
delicacy
:
fine
,
much
fine
,
than
you
could
be
prepare
to
meet
with
;
than
you
could
believe
inherent
in
him
,
even
after
year
of
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
till
some
over
-
sharp
contact
with
his
nerve
have
betray
,
by
its
effect
,
their
acute
sensibility
,
this
elaborate
construction
must
be
ignore
;
and
the
more
especially
because
the
sympathetic
faculty
be
not
prominent
in
him
:
to
feel
,
and
to
seize
quickly
another
's
feeling
,
be
separate
property
;
a
few
construction
possess
both
,
some
neither
.
<EOS>
Dr.
John
have
the
one
in
exquisite
perfection
;
and
because
I
have
admit
that
he
be
not
endow
with
the
other
in
equal
degree
,
the
reader
will
considerately
refrain
from
pass
to
an
extreme
,
and
pronounce
him
_
un_sympathizing
,
unfeele
:
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
he
be
a
kind
,
generous
man
.
<EOS>
make
your
need
know
,
his
hand
be
open
.
<EOS>
put
your
grief
into
word
,
he
turn
no
deaf
ear
.
<EOS>
expect
refinement
of
perception
,
miracle
of
intuition
,
and
realize
disappointment
.
<EOS>
this
night
,
when
Dr.
John
enter
the
room
,
and
meet
the
evening
lamp
,
I
see
well
and
at
one
glance
his
whole
mechanism
.
  
<EOS>
to
one
who
have
name
him
"
slave
,
"
and
,
on
any
point
,
ban
him
from
respect
,
he
must
now
have
peculiar
feeling
.
<EOS>
that
the
epithet
be
well
apply
,
and
the
ban
just
,
may
be
;
he
put
forth
no
denial
that
it
be
so
:
<EOS>
his
mind
even
candidly
revolve
that
unman
possibility
.
<EOS>
He
seek
in
this
accusation
the
cause
of
that
ill
-
success
which
have
get
<EOS>
so
gall
a
hold
on
his
mental
peace
<EOS>
:
amid
the
worry
of
a
self
-
condemnatory
soliloquy
,
his
demeanour
seem
grave
,
perhaps
cold
,
both
to
me
and
his
mother
.
<EOS>
and
yet
there
be
no
bad
feeling
,
no
malice
,
no
rancour
,
no
littleness
in
his
countenance
,
beautiful
with
a
man
's
good
beauty
,
even
in
its
depression
.
<EOS>
when
I
place
his
chair
at
the
table
,
which
I
hasten
to
do
,
anticipate
the
servant
,
and
when
I
hand
him
his
tea
,
which
I
do
with
tremble
care
,
he
say
:
"
thank
you
,
Lucy
,
"
in
as
kindly
a
tone
of
his
full
pleasant
voice
as
ever
my
ear
welcome
.
  
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
there
be
only
one
plan
to
be
pursue
;
I
must
expiate
my
culpable
vehemence
,
or
I
must
not
sleep
that
night
.
<EOS>
this
would
not
do
at
all
;
I
could
not
stand
it
<EOS>
:
I
make
no
pretence
of
capacity
to
wage
war
on
this
footing
.
<EOS>
school
solitude
,
conventual
silence
and
stagnation
,
<EOS>
anything
seem
preferable
to
live
embroil
with
Dr.
John
.
<EOS>
as
to
Ginevra
,
she
may
take
the
silver
wing
of
a
dove
,
or
any
other
fowl
that
fly
,
and
mount
straight
up
to
the
high
place
,
among
the
high
star
,
where
her
lover
's
high
flight
of
fancy
choose
to
fix
the
constellation
of
her
charm
:
never
more
be
it
mine
to
dispute
the
arrangement
.
<EOS>
long
I
try
to
catch
his
eye
.
<EOS>
again
and
again
that
eye
just
meet
mine
;
but
,
have
nothing
to
say
,
it
withdraw
,
and
I
be
baffle
.
<EOS>
after
tea
,
he
sit
,
sad
and
quiet
,
read
a
book
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
have
dare
to
go
and
sit
near
him
,
but
it
seem
that
if
I
venture
to
take
that
step
,
he
would
infallibly
evince
hostility
and
indignation
.
<EOS>
I
long
to
speak
out
,
and
I
dare
not
whisper
.
<EOS>
His
mother
leave
the
room
;
then
,
move
by
insupportable
regret
,
I
just
murmur
the
word
"
Dr.
Bretton
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
look
up
from
his
book
;
his
eye
be
not
cold
or
malevolent
,
his
mouth
be
not
cynical
;
he
be
ready
and
willing
to
hear
what
I
may
have
to
say
:
his
spirit
be
of
vintage
too
mellow
and
generous
to
sour
in
one
thunder
-
clap
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dr.
Bretton
,
forgive
my
hasty
word
:

do

<EOS>
He
smile
that
moment
I
speak

perhaps
I
deserve
them

not

I
be
sure
it
be
because
I

that

such

case

be
it
the
fault

your
character

now
,
let
me
unsay
what
I

in
anger

in

in

I
deeply

if
in

course
of
this
work
,
you
find
that
my
opinion
of
Dr.
John
undergo
modification
,
excuse
the
seem
inconsistency
.
<EOS>
I
give
the
feeling
as
at
the
time
I
feel
it
;
I
describe
the
view
of
character
as
it
appear
when
discover

<EOS>
He
show
the
fineness
of
his
nature
by
be
kind
to
me
after
that
misunderstanding
than
before
.
<EOS>
nay
,
the
very
incident
which
,
by
my
theory
,
must
in
some
degree
estrange
me
and
him
,
change
,
indeed
,
somewhat
our
relation
;
but
not
in
the
sense
I
painfully
anticipate
.
<EOS>
an
invisible
,
but
a
cold
something
,
very
slight
,
very
transparent
,
but
very
chill
:
a
sort
of
screen
of
ice
have
hitherto
,
all
through
our
two
life
,
glaze
the
medium
through
which
we
exchange
intercourse
.
<EOS>
those
few
warm
word
,
though
only
warm
with
anger
,
breathe
on
that
frail
frost
-
work
of
reserve
;
about
this
time
,
it
give
note
of
dissolution
.
<EOS>
I
think
from
that
day
,
so
long
as
we
continue
friend
,
he
never
in
discourse
stand
on
topic
of
ceremony
with
me
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
know
that
if
he
would
but
talk
about
himself
,
and
about
that
in
which
he
be
most
interested
,
my
expectation
would
always
be
answer
,
my
wish
always
satisfied
.
<EOS>
It
follow
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
that
I
continue
to
hear
much
of
"
Ginevra
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
ginevra
!
"
<EOS>
He
think
her
so
fair
,
so
good
;
he
speak
so
lovingly
of
her
charm
,
her
sweetness
,
her
innocence
,
that
,
in
spite
of
my
plain
prose
knowledge
of
the
reality
,
a
kind
of
reflect
glow
begin
to
settle
on
her
idea
,
even
for
me
.
<EOS>
still
,
reader
,
I
be
free
to
confess
,
that
he
often
talk
nonsense
;
but
I
strove
to
be
unfailingly
patient
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
my
lesson
:
I
have
learn
how
severe
for
me
be
the
pain
of
crossing
,
or
grieving
,
or
disappoint
him
.
<EOS>
in
a
strange
and
new
sense
,
I
grow
most
selfish
,
and
quite
powerless
to
deny
myself
the
delight
of
indulge
his
mood
,
and
be
pliant
to
his
will
.
<EOS>
He
still
seem
to
me
most
absurd
when
he
obstinately
doubt
,
and
despond
about
his
power
to
win
in
the
end
Miss
Fanshawe
's
preference
.
<EOS>
the
fancy
become
rooted
in
my
own
mind
more
stubbornly
than
ever
,
that
she
be
only
coquet
to
goad
him
,
and
that
,
at
heart
,
she
covet
everyone
of
his
word
and
look
.
<EOS>
sometimes
he
harass
me
,
in
spite
of
my
resolution
to
bear
and
hear
;
in
the
midst
of
the
indescribable
gall
-
honey
pleasure
of
thus
bear
and
hear
,
he
strike
so
on
the
flint
of
what
firmness
I
own
,
that
it
emit
fire
once
and
again
.
<EOS>
I
chance
to
assert
one
day
,
with
a
view
to
still
his
impatience
,
that
in
my
own
mind
,
I
feel
positive
Miss

intend
eventually

accept

Hush

on

Ginevra

have
her
hand
fill
from
your

more
time
than
I
can
count

<EOS>
You
have
seek
for
her
the
costly
flower
;
you
have
busy
your
brain
in
devise
gift
the
most
delicate
:
<EOS>
such
,
one
would
have
think
,
as
only
a
woman
could
have
imagine
;
and
in
addition
,
Miss
Fanshawe
own
a
set
of
ornament
,
to
purchase
which
your
generosity
must
have
verge
on
extravagance
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
modesty
Ginevra
herself
have
never
evince
in
this
matter
,
now
flush
all
over
the
face
of
her
admirer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
destructively
snip
a
skein
of
silk
with
my
scissor
.
<EOS>
"
I
offer
them
to
please
myself
:
<EOS>
I
feel
she
do
me
a
favour
in
accept
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
do
more
than
a
favour
,
Dr.
John
:
she
pledge
her
very
honour
that
she
would
make
you
some
return
;
and
if
she
can
not
pay
you
in
affection
,
she
ought
to
hand
out
a
business
-
like
equivalent
,
in
the
shape
of
some
rouleaux
of
gold
piece
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
do
not
understand
her
;
she
be
far
too
disintereste
to
care
for
my
gift
,
and
too
simple
-
minded
to
know
their
value
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
laugh
out
:
I
have
hear
her
adjudge
to
every
jewel
its
price
;
and
well
I
know
money
-
embarrassment
,
money
-
scheme
;
money
's
worth
,
and
endeavour
to
realise
supply
,
have
,
young
<EOS>
as
she

furnish
the
most
frequent
,
and
the
favourite
stimulus
of
her
thought
for
year

<EOS>
He
pursue
.
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
see
her
whenever
I
have
lay
on
her
lap
some
trifle
;
so
cool
,
so
unmoved
:
<EOS>
no
eagerness
to
take
,
not
even
pleasure
in
contemplating
.
<EOS>
just
from
amiable
reluctance
to
grieve
me
,
she
would
permit
the
bouquet
to
lie
beside
her
,
and
perhaps
consent
to
bear
it
away
.
<EOS>
or
,
if
I
achieve
the
fastening
of
a
bracelet
on
her
ivory
arm
,
however
pretty
the
trinket
may
be
<EOS>
(
and
I
always
carefully
choose
what
seem
to
_
me
_
pretty
,
and
what
of
course
be
not
valueless
)
,
the
glitter
never
dazzle
her
bright
eye

she
would
hardly
cast
one
look
on
my
gift

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
of
course
,
not
value
it
,
she
would
unloose
,
and
return
it
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
for
such
a
repulse
she
be
too
good
-
natured
.
<EOS>
She
would
consent
to
seem
to
forget
what
I
have
do
,
and
retain
the
offering
with
lady
-
like
quiet
and
easy
oblivion
.
<EOS>
under
such
circumstance
,
how
can
a
man
build
on
acceptance
of
his
present
as
a
favourable
symptom
?
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
be
I
to
offer
her
all
I
have
,
and
she
to
take
it
,
such
be
her
incapacity
to
be
sway
by
sordid
consideration
,
I
should
not
venture
to
believe
the
transaction
advance
me
one
step
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
Dr.
John
,
"
I
begin
,
"
love
be
blind
;
"
but
just
then
a
blue
subtle
ray
speed
sideways
from
Dr.
John
's
eye
:
it
remind
me
of
old
day
,
it
remind
me
of
his
picture
:
it
half
lead
me
to
think
that
part
,
at
least
,
of
his
professed
persuasion
of
Miss
Fanshawe
's
_
naïveté
_
be
assume
;
it
lead
me
dubiously
to
conjecture
that
perhaps
,
in
spite
of
his
passion
for
her
beauty
,
his
appreciation
of
her
foible
may
possibly
be
less
mistaken
,
more
clear
-
sighted
,
than
from
his
general
language
be
presumable
.
<EOS>
after
all
it
may
be
only
a
chance
look
,
or
at
good
the
token
of
a
merely
momentary
impression
.
<EOS>
chance
or
intentional
real
or
imaginary
,
it
close
the
conversation
.
    
<EOS>
the
CLEOPATRA
.
  
<EOS>
My
stay
at
La
Terrasse
be
prolong
a
fortnight
beyond
the
close
of
the
vacation
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
's
kind
management
procure
me
this
respite
.
<EOS>
Her
son
have
one
day
deliver
the
dictum
that
"
Lucy
be
not
yet
strong
enough
to
go
back
to
that
den
of
a
pensionnat
,
"
she
at
once
drive
over
to
the
Rue
Fossette
,
have
an
interview
with
the
directress
,
and
procure
the
indulgence
,
on
the
plea
of
prolonged
rest
and
change
be
necessary
to
perfect
recovery
.
<EOS>
Hereupon
,
however
,
follow
an
attention
I
could
very
well
have
dispense
with
,
viz
 
a
polite
call
from
Madame
Beck
.
  
<EOS>
that
lady
 
<EOS>
one
fine
day
 
actually
come
out
in
a
fiacre
as
far
as
the
château
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
have
resolve
within
herself
to
see
what
manner
of
place
Dr.
John
inhabit
.
<EOS>
apparently
,
the
pleasant
site
and
neat
interior
surpass
her
expectation
;
she
eulogize
all
she
see
,
pronounce
the
blue
salon
"
une
pièce
magnifique
,
"
profusely
congratulate
me
on
the
acquisition
of
friend
,
"
tellement
digne

aimable

et
respectable

"
turn
also
a
neat
compliment
in
my
favour
,
and
,
upon
Dr.
John
come
in
,
run
up
to
him
with
the
utmost
buoyancy
,
open
at
the
same
time
such
a
fire
of
rapid
language
,
all
sparkle
with
felicitation
and
protestation
about
his
"
château
,
"
 
"
madame
sa
mère
,
la
digne
châtelaine
:
"
also
his
look
;
which
,
indeed
,
be
very
flourishing
,
and
at
the
moment
additionally
embellish
by
the
good
-
natured
but
amused
smile
with
which
he
always
listen
to
Madame
's
fluent
and
florid
French
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
Madame
shine
in
her
very
good
phase
that
day
,
and
come
in
and
go
out
quite
a
live
catherine
-
wheel
of
compliment
,
delight
,
and
affability
.
<EOS>
half
purposely
,
and
half
to
ask
some
question
about
school
-
business
,
I
follow
her
to
the
carriage
,
and
look
in
after
she
be
seat
and
the
door
close
.
<EOS>
in
that
brief
fraction
of
time
what
a
change
have
be
work
!
<EOS>
an
instant
ago
,
all
sparkle
and
jest
,
she
now
sit
sterner
than
a
judge
and
graver
than
a
sage
.
<EOS>
strange
little
woman
!
  
<EOS>
I
go
back
and
tease
Dr.
John
about
Madame
's
devotion
to
him
.
<EOS>
how
he
laugh
!
<EOS>
what
fun
shone
in
his
eye
as
he
recall
some
of
her
fine
speech
,
and
repeat
them
,
imitate
her
voluble
delivery
!
<EOS>
He
have
an
acute
sense
of
humour
,
and
be
the
fine
company
in
the
world
 
when
he
could
forget
Miss
Fanshawe
.
     
<EOS>
to
"
sit
in
sunshine
calm
and
sweet
"
be
say
to
be
excellent
for
weak
people
;
it
give
them
vital
force
.
<EOS>
when
little
Georgette
Beck
be
recover
from
her
illness
,
I
use
to
take
her
in
my
arm
and
walk
with
her
in
the
garden
by
the
hour
together
,
beneath
a
certain
wall
hang
with
grape
,
which
the
southern
sun
be
ripen
:
that
sun
cherish
her
little
pale
frame
quite
as
effectually
as
it
mellow
and
swell
the
clustering
fruit
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
human
temper
,
bland
,
glowing
,
and
genial
,
within
whose
influence
it
be
as
good
for
the
poor
in
spirit
to
live
,
as
it
be
for
the
feeble
in
frame
to
bask
in
the
glow
of
noon
.
<EOS>
of
the
number
of
these
choice
nature
be
certainly
both
Dr.
Bretton
's
and
his
mother
's
.
<EOS>
They
like
to
communicate
happiness
,
as
some
like
to
occasion
misery
:
they
do
it
instinctively
;
without
fuss
,
and
apparently
with
little
consciousness
;
the
mean
to
give
pleasure
rise
spontaneously
in
their
mind
.
<EOS>
every
day
while
I
stay
with
them
,
some
little
plan
be
propose
which
result
in
beneficial
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
fully
occupy
as
be
Dr.
John
's
time
,
he
still
make
it
in
his
way
to
accompany
us
in
each
brief
excursion
.
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
tell
how
he
manage
his
engagement
;
they
be
numerous
,
yet
by
dint
of
system
,
he
class
them
in
an
order
which
leave
him
a
daily
period
of
liberty
.
<EOS>
I
often
see
him
hard
-
worked
,
yet
seldom
over
-
drive
,
and
never
irritated
,
confused
,
or
oppress
.
<EOS>
what
he
do
be
accomplish
with
the
ease
and
grace
of
all
-
suffice
strength
;
with
the
bountiful
cheerfulness
of
high
and
unbroken
energy
.
<EOS>
under
his
guidance
I
see
,
in
that
one
happy
fortnight
,
more
of
Villette
,
its
environ
,
and
its
inhabitant
,
than
I
have
see
in
the
whole
eight
month
of
my
previous
residence
.
<EOS>
He
take
me
to
place
of
interest
in
the
town
,
of
whose
name
<EOS>
I
have
not
before
so
much
as
hear
;
with
willingness
and
spirit
he
communicate
much
noteworthy
information
.
<EOS>
He
never
seem
to
think
it
a
trouble
to
talk
to
me
,
and
,
I
be
sure
,
it
be
never
a
task
to
me
to
listen
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
his
way
to
treat
subject
coldly
and
vaguely
;
he
rarely
generalize
,
never
prose
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
like
nice
detail
almost
as
much
as
I
like
them
myself
:
he
seem
observant
of
character
:
and
not
superficially
observant
,
either
.
<EOS>
these
point
give
the
quality
of
interest
to
his
discourse
;
and
the
fact
of
his
speak
direct
from
his
own
resource
,
and
not
borrow
or
steal
from
book
 
here
a
dry
fact
,
and
there
a
trite
phrase
,
and
elsewhere
a
hackneye
opinion
 
ensure
a
freshness
,
as
welcome
as
it
be
rare
.
<EOS>
before
my
eye
,
too
,
his
disposition
seem
to
unfold
another
phase
;
to
pass
to
a
fresh
day
:
to
rise
in
new
and
noble
dawn
.
  
<EOS>
His
mother
possess
a
good
development
of
benevolence
,
but
he
own
a
well
and
large
.
<EOS>
I
find
,
on
accompany
him
to
the
Basse
-
Ville
 
<EOS>
the
poor
and
crowded
quarter
of
the
city
 
<EOS>
that
his
errand
there
be
as
much
those
of
the
philanthropist
as
the
physician
.
<EOS>
I
understand
presently
that
cheerfully
,
habitually
,
and
in
single
-
minded
unconsciousness
of
any
special
merit
distinguish
his
deed
 
he
be
achieve
,
amongst
a
very
wretched
population
,
a
world
of
active
good
.
<EOS>
the
low
order
like
him
well
;
his
poor
,
patient
in
the
hospital
welcome
him
with
a
sort
of
enthusiasm
.
  
<EOS>
but
stop
 
<EOS>
I
must
not
,
from
the
faithful
narrator
<EOS>
,
degenerate
into
the
partial
eulogist
.
<EOS>
well
,
full
well
,
do
I
know
that
Dr.
John
be
not
perfect
,
anymore
than
I
be
perfect
.
<EOS>
human
fallibility
leaven
him
throughout
:
there
be
no
hour
,
and
scarcely
a
moment
of
the
time
I
spend
with
him
that
in
act
or
speech
,
or
look
,
he
do
not
betray
something
that
be
not
of
a
god
.
<EOS>
a
god
could
not
have
the
cruel
vanity
of
Dr.
John
,
nor
his
sometime
levity
.
<EOS>
,
no
immortal
could
have
resemble
him
in
his
occasional
temporary
oblivion
of
all
but
the
present
 
in
his
pass
passion
for
that
present
;
show
not
coarsely
,
by
devote
it
to
material
indulgence
,
but
selfishly
,
by
extract
from
it
whatever
it
could
yield
of
nutriment
to
his
masculine
self
-
love
:
his
delight
be
to
feed
that
ravenous
sentiment
,
without
thought
of
the
price
of
provender
,
or
care
for
the
cost
of
keep
it
sleek
and
high
-
pampered
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
be
request
to
note
a
seem
contradiction
in
the
two
view
which
have
be
give
of
Graham
Bretton
 
the
public
and
private
 
the
out
-
door
and
the
in
-
door
view
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
,
the
public
,
he
be
show
oblivious
of
self
;
as
modest
in
the
display
of
his
energy
,
as
earnest
in
their
exercise
.
<EOS>
in
the
second
,
the
fireside
picture
,
there
be
express
consciousness
of
what
he
have
and
what
he
be
;
pleasure
in
homage
,
some
recklessness
in
exciting
,
some
vanity
in
receive
the
same
.
<EOS>
both
portrait
be
correct
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
possible
to
oblige
Dr.
John
quietly
and
in
secret
.
<EOS>
when
you
think
that
the
fabrication
of
some
trifle
dedicated
to
his
use
have
be
achieve
unnoticed
,
and
that
,
like
other
man
,
he
would
use
it
when
place
ready
for
his
use
,
and
never
ask
whence
it
come
,
he
amaze
you
by
a
smilingly
-
uttered
observation
or
two
,
prove
that
his
eye
have
be
on
the
work
from
commencement
to
close
:
that
he
have
note
the
design
,
trace
its
progress
,
and
mark
its
completion
.
<EOS>
It
please
him
to
be
thus
serve
,
and
he
let
his
pleasure
beam
in
his
eye
and
play
about
his
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
this
would
have
be
all
very
well
,
if
he
have
not
add
to
such
kindly
and
unobtrusive
evidence
a
certain
wilfulness
in
discharge
what
he
call
debt
.
<EOS>
when
his
mother
work
for
him
,
he
pay
her
by
shower
about
her
his
bright
animal
spirit
,
with
even
more
affluence
than
his
gay
,
taunt
,
teasing
,
love
will
not
.
<EOS>
if
Lucy
Snowe
be
discover
to
have
put
her
hand
to
such
work
,
he
plan
,
in
recompence
,
some
pleasant
recreation
.
  
<EOS>
I
often
feel
amazed
at
his
perfect
knowledge
of
Villette
;
a
knowledge
not
merely
confine
to
its
open
street
,
but
penetrate
to
all
its
gallery
,
salle
,
and
cabinet
:
of
every
door
which
shut
in
an
object
worth
seeing
,
of
every
museum
,
of
every
hall
,
sacred
to
art
or
science
,
he
seem
to
possess
the
"
open
!
<EOS>
Sesame
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
have
a
head
for
science
,
but
an
ignorant
,
blind
,
fond
instinct
incline
me
to
art
.
<EOS>
I
like
to
visit
the
picture
-
gallery
,
and
I
dearly
like
to
be
leave
there
alone
.
<EOS>
in
company
,
a
wretched
idiosyncracy
forbid
me
to
see
much
or
to
feel
anything
.
<EOS>
in
unfamiliar
company
,
where
it
be
necessary
to
maintain
a
flow
of
talk
on
the
subject
in
presence
,
half
an
hour
would
knock
me
up
,
with
a
combined
pressure
of
physical
lassitude
and
entire
mental
incapacity
.
<EOS>
I
never
yet
see
the
well
-
rear
child
,
much
less
the
educate
adult
,
who
could
not
put
me
to
shame
,
by
the
sustained
intelligence
of
its
demeanour
under
the
ordeal
of
a
conversable
,
sociable
visitation
of
picture
,
historical
sight
or
building

or
any
lion
of
public
interest

<EOS>
Dr.
Bretton
be
a
cicerone
after
my
own
heart
;
he
would
take
me
betime
,
ere
the
gallery
be
fill
,
leave
me
there
for
two
or
three
hour
,
and
call
for
me
when
his
own
engagement
be
discharge
.
<EOS>
meantime
,
I
be
happy
;
happy
,
not
always
in
admiring
,
but
in
examine
,
question
,
and
form
conclusion
.
<EOS>
in
the
commencement
of
these
visit
,
there
be
some
misunderstanding
and
consequent
struggle
between
Will
and
Power
.
<EOS>
the
former
faculty
exact
approbation
of
that
which
it
be
consider
orthodox
to
admire
;
the
latter
groan
forth
its
utter
inability
to
pay
the
tax
;
it
be
then
self
-
sneered
at
,
spur
up
,
goad
on
to
refine
its
taste
,
and
whet
its
z
.
<EOS>
the
more
it
be
chidden
,
however
,
the
more
it
would
not
praise
.
<EOS>
discover
gradually
that
a
wonderful
sense
of
fatigue
result
from
these
conscientious
effort
,
I
begin
to
reflect
whether
I
may
not
dispense
with
that
great
labour
,
and
conclude
eventually
that
I
may
,
and
so
sink
supine
into
a
luxury
of
calm
before
ninety
-
nine
out
of
a
hundred
of
the
exhibit
frame
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
that
an
original
and
good
picture
be
just
as
scarce
as
an
original
and
good
book
;
nor
do
I
,
in
the
end
,
tremble
to
say
to
myself
,
stand
before
certain
_
chef
-
d'oeuvres
<EOS>
_
bear
great
name
,
"
these
be
not
a
whit
like
nature
.
<EOS>
Nature

daylight
never
have
that
colour
:
never
be
make
so
turbid
,
either
by
storm
or
cloud
,
as
it
be
lay
out
there
,
under
a
sky
of
indigo
:
and
that
indigo
be
not
ether
;
and
those
dark
weed
plaster
upon
it
be
not

.
<EOS>
"
several

me
as
by
no

the

<EOS>
many

<EOS>
and
yet
there
be
fragment
of
truth
here
and
there
which
satisfy
the
conscience
,
and
gleam
of
light
that
cheer
the
vision

<EOS>
Nature
's
power

break
through
in
a

and
there
her
glory
in
a
sunny
southern

<EOS>
an
expression
in
this
portrait
prove
clear
insight
into
character
;
a
face
in
that
historical
painting
,
by
its
vivid
filial
likeness
,
startlingly
remind
you

it
birth

<EOS>
these

I
love

they
grow
dear
as

<EOS>
one
day
,
at
a
quiet
early
hour
,
I
find
myself
nearly
alone
in
a
certain
gallery
,
wherein
one
particular
picture
of
portentous
size
,
set
up
in
the
good
light
,
have
a
cordon
of
protection
stretch
before
it
,
and
a
cushioned
bench
duly
set
in
front
for
the
accommodation
of
worship
connoisseur
,
who
,
have
gaze
themselves
off
their
foot
,
may
be
fain
to
complete
the
business
sit
:
this
picture
,
I
say
,
seem
to
consider
itself
the
queen
of
the
collection
.
  
<EOS>
It
represent
a
woman
,
considerably
large
,
I
think
,
than
the
life
.
<EOS>
I
calculate
that
this
lady
,
put
into
a
scale
of
magnitude
,
suitable
for
the
reception
of
a
commodity
of
bulk
,
would
infallibly
turn
from
fourteen
to
sixteen
stone
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
indeed
,
extremely
well
fed
:
very
much
butcher
's
meat
 
to
say
nothing
of
bread
,
vegetable
,
and
liquid
 
must
she
have
consume
to
attain
that
breadth
and
height
,
that
wealth
of
muscle
,
that
affluence
of
flesh
.
<EOS>
She
lie
half
-
recline
on
a
couch
:
why
,
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
;
broad
daylight
blaze
round
her
;
she
appear
in
hearty
health
,
strong
enough
to
do
the
work
of
two
plain
cook
;
she
could
not
plead
a
weak
spine
;
she
ought
to
have
be
stand
,
or
at
least
sit
bolt
upright
.
<EOS>
She
,
have
no
business
to
lounge
away
the
noon
on
a
sofa
.
<EOS>
She
ought
likewise
to
have
wear
decent
garment
;
a
gown
cover
her
properly
,
which
be
not
the
case
:
out
of
abundance
of
material
 
seven
-
and
-
twenty
yard
,
I
should
say
,
of
drapery
 
she
manage
to
make
inefficient
raiment
.
<EOS>
then
,
for
the
wretched
untidiness
surround
her
,
there
could
be
no
excuse
.
<EOS>
pot
and
pan
 
<EOS>
perhaps
I
ought
to
say
vase
and
goblet
 
be
roll
here
and
there
on
the
foreground
;
a
perfect
rubbish
of
flower
be
mix
amongst
them
,
and
an
absurd
and
disorderly
mass
of
curtain
upholstery
smother
the
couch
and
cumber
the
floor
.
<EOS>
on
refer
to
the
catalogue
,
I
find
that
this
notable
production
bear
the
name
"
Cleopatra
.
"
  
<EOS>
well
,
I
be
sit
wonder
at
it
(
as
the
bench
be
there
,
I
think
I
may
as
well
take
advantage
of
its
accommodation
)
,
and
think
that
while
some
of
the
detail
 
as
rose
,
gold
cup
,
jewel
,
&
c.
,
be
very
prettily
paint
,
it
be
on
the
whole
an
enormous
piece
of
claptrap
;
the
room
,
almost
vacant
when
I
enter
,
begin
to
fill
.
<EOS>
scarcely
notice
this
circumstance
(
as
,
indeed
,
it
do
not
matter
to
me
)
<EOS>
I
retain
my
seat
;
rather
to
rest
myself
than
with
a
view
to
study
this
huge
,
dark
-
complexioned
gipsy
-
queen
;
of
whom
,
indeed
,
I
soon
tire
,
and
betook
myself
for
refreshment
to
the
contemplation
of
some
exquisite
little
picture
of
still
life
:
wild
-
flower
,
wild
-
fruit
,
mossy
woodnest
,
casket
egg
that
look
like
pearl
see
through
clear
green
sea
-
water
;
all
hang
modestly
beneath
that
coarse
and
preposterous
canvas
.
  
<EOS>
suddenly
a
light
tap
visit
my
shoulder
.
<EOS>
start
,
turn
,
I
meet
a
face
bent
to
encounter
mine
;
a
frowning
,
almost
a
shocked
face
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
"

They
be
paint
rather
in
a
remarkable
style
 
flat
,
dead
,
pale
,
and
formal
.
<EOS>
the
first
represent
a
"
Jeune
Fille

"
come
out
of
a
church
-
door
,
a
missal
in
her
hand
,
her
dress
very
prim
,
her
eye
cast
down
,
her
mouth
purse
up

image

a
most
villanous
little
precocious
she
-
hypocrite

kneel

chamber

hold
her
hand
plaster
together
,
finger

finger
,
and
show
the
white
of
her
eye
in
a
most
exasperating
manner
.
<EOS>
the
third
,
a
"
Jeune
Mère

"
hang
disconsolate
over
a
clayey
and
puffy
baby
with
a
face
like
an
unwholesome
full

<EOS>
the
fourth

It
be
impossible
to
keep
one
's
attention
long
confine
to
these
master

piece
,
and
so
,
by
degree
,
I
veer
round
,
and
survey
the
gallery
.
  
<EOS>
a
perfect
crowd
of
spectator
be
by
this
time
gather
round
the
Lioness
,
from
whose
vicinage
I
have
be
banish
;
nearly
half
this
crowd
be
lady
,
but
M.
Paul
afterwards
tell
me
,
these
be
"
des
dame
,
"
and
it
be
quite
proper
for
them
to
contemplate
what
no
"
demoiselle
"
ought
to
glance
at
.
<EOS>
I
assure
him
plainly
I
could
not
agree
in
this
doctrine
,
and
do
not
see
the
sense
of
it
;
<EOS>
whereupon
,
with
his
usual
absolutism
,
he
merely
request
my
silence
,
and
also
,
in
the
same
breath
,
denounce
my
mingled
rashness
and
ignorance
.
<EOS>
a
more
despotic
little
man
than
M.
Paul
never
fill
a
professor
's
chair
.
<EOS>
I
notice
,
by
the
way
,
that
he
look
at
the
picture
himself
quite
at
his
ease
,
and
for
a
very
long
while
:
he
do
not
,
however
,
neglect
to
glance
from
time
to
time
my
way
,
in
order
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
to
make
sure
that
I
be
obey
order
,
and
not
break
bound
.
<EOS>
by
-
and
-
by
,
he
again
accost
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
I
not
be
ill

"
<EOS>
he
wish
to
know
:
"
he
understand
I

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
but
I
be
now
quite
well

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
have
I
spend
the
vacation
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Chiefly
in
the
Rue
Fossette
;
partly
with
Madame
Bretton
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
have
hear
that
I
be
leave
alone
in
the
Rue
Fossette
;
be
that
so
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
quite
alone
<EOS>
:
Marie
Broc
"
(
the
crétin
)
"
be
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
shrug
his
shoulder
;
varied
and
contradictory
expression
play
rapidly
over
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
Marie
Broc
be
well
known
to
M.
Paul
;
he
never
give
a
lesson
in
the
third
division
(
contain
the
least
advanced
pupil
)
,
that
she
do
not
occasion
in
him
a
sharp
conflict
between
antagonistic
impression
.
<EOS>
Her
personal
appearance
,
her
repulsive
manner
,
her
often
unmanageable
disposition
,
irritate
his
temper
,
and
inspire
him
with
strong
antipathy
;
a
feeling
he
be
too
apt
to
conceive
when
his
taste
be
offend
or
his
will
thwart
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
her
misfortune
,
constitute
a
strong
claim
on
his
forbearance
and
compassion
 
such
a
claim
as
it
be
not
in
his
nature
to
deny
;
hence
result
almost
daily
draw
battle
between
impatience
and
disgust
on
the
one
hand
,
pity
and
a
sense
of
justice
on
the
other
;
in
which
,
to
his
credit
be
it
say
,
it
be
very
seldom
that
the
former
feeling
prevail
:
<EOS>
when
they
do
,
however
,
M.
Paul
show
a
phase
of
character
which
have
its
terror
.
<EOS>
His
passion
be
strong
,
his
aversion
and
attachment
alike
vivid
;
the
force
he
exert
in
hold
both
in
check
by
no
means
mitigate
an
observer
's
sense
of
their
vehemence
.
<EOS>
with
such
tendency
,
it
may
well
be
suppose
he
often
excited
in
ordinary
mind
fear
and
dislike
;
yet
it
be
an
error
to
fear
him
:
<EOS>
nothing
drive
him
so
nearly
frantic
as
the
tremor
of
an
apprehensive
and
distrustful
spirit
;
nothing
soothe
him
like
confidence
temper
with
gentleness
.
<EOS>
to
evince
these
sentiment
,
however
,
require
a
thorough
comprehension
of
his
nature

and
his
nature

of
an
order
rarely
comprehend

"
how

on

it

It
would
have
be
easy
to

<EOS>

I

I
see
there
a
person
I
know

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
fact
,
I
have
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
head
too
pretty
to
belong
to
any
other
than
the
redoubte
Colonel
de
Hamal
.
<EOS>
what
a
very
finished
,
highly
polished
little
pate
it
be
!
<EOS>
what
a
figure
,
so
trim
and
natty
!
<EOS>
what
womanish
foot
and
hand
!
<EOS>
how
daintily
he
hold
a
glass
to
one
of
his
optic
!
<EOS>
with
what
admiration
he
gaze
upon
the
Cleopatra
!
<EOS>
and
then
,
how
engagingly
he
titter
and
whisper
a
friend
at
his
elbow
!
<EOS>
oh
,
the
man
of
sense
!
<EOS>
oh
,
the
refined
gentleman
of
superior
taste
and
tact
!
<EOS>
I
observe
him
for
about
ten
minute
,
and
perceive
that
he
be
exceedingly
take
with
this
dusk
and
portly
Venus
of
the
Nile
.
<EOS>
so
much
be
I
interested
in
his
bearing
,
so
absorb
in
divine
his
character
by
his
look
and
movement
,
I
temporarily
forget
M.
Paul
;
in
the
interim
a
group
come
between
that
gentleman
and
me
;
or
possibly
his
scruple
may
have
receive
another
and
bad
shock
from
my
present
abstraction
,
cause
him
to
withdraw
voluntarily
:
at
any
rate
,
when
I
again
look
round
,
he
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
My
eye
,
pursuant
of
the
search
,
meet
not
him
,
but
another
and
dissimilar
figure
,
<EOS>
well
see
amidst
the
crowd
,
for
the
height
as
well
as
the
port
lend
each
its
distinction
.
<EOS>
this
way
come
Dr.
John
,
in
visage
,
in
shape
,
in
hue
,
as
unlike
the
dark
,
acerb
,
and
caustic
little
professor
,
as
the
fruit
of
the
Hesperides
may
be
unlike
the
sloe
in
the
wild
thicket
;
as
the
high
-
couraged
but
tractable
Arabian
be
unlike
the
rude
and
stubborn
"
sheltie

"
<EOS>
He
be
look
for
me
,
but
have
not
yet
explore
the
corner
where
the
schoolmaster
have
just
put
me
.
<EOS>
I
remain
quiet
;
yet
another
minute
I
would
watch
.
  
<EOS>
He
approach
de
Hamal
;
he
pause
near
him
;
I
think
he
have
a
pleasure
in
look
over
his
head
;
Dr.
Bretton
,
too
,
gaze
on
the
Cleopatra
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
if
it
be
to
his
taste
:
he
do
not
simper
like
the
little
Count
;
his
mouth
look
fastidious
,
his
eye
cool
;
without
demonstration
he
step
aside
,
leave
room
for
other
to
approach
.
<EOS>
I
see
now
that
he
be
wait
,
and
,
rise
,
I
join
him
.
  
<EOS>
We
take
one
turn
round
the
gallery
;
with
Graham
it
be
very
pleasant
to
take
such
a
turn
.
<EOS>
I
always
like
dearly
to
hear
what
he
have
to
say
about
either
picture
or
book
;
because
without
pretend
to
be
a
connoisseur
,
he
always
speak
his
thought
,
and
that
be
sure
to
be
fresh
:
very
often
it
be
also
just
and
pithy
.
<EOS>
It
be
pleasant
also
to
tell
him
some
thing
he
do
not
know
 
<EOS>
he
listen
so
kindly
,
so
teachably
;
unformalize
by
scruple
lest
so
to
bend
his
bright
handsome
head
,
to
gather
a
woman
's
rather
obscure
and
stammering
explanation
,
<EOS>
should
imperil
the
dignity
of
his
manhood
.
<EOS>
and
when
he
communicate
information
in
return
,
it
be
with
a
lucid
intelligence
that
leave
all
his
word
clear
graven
on
the
memory
;
no
explanation
of
his
giving
,
no
fact
of
his
narrating
,
do
I
ever
forget
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
leave
the
gallery
,
I
ask
him
what
he
think
of
the
Cleopatra
(
after
make
him
laugh
by
tell
him
how
Professor
Emanuel
have
send
me
to
the
right
about
,
and
take
him
to
see
the
sweet
series
of
picture
recommend
to
my
attention

myself
in
the
costume

lady

"
We
shall
see

rejoin

You
will
wear
it
this

evening

<EOS>

think
I

go
on
to
decree
that
I
be

go
with

Graham

a
concert
that

night

which
concert

she
explain

be
a

affair

the
most
advanced
of

perform
:
it
be

to
crown
all

enjoin
attention

costume

about
six

I
be
usher

<EOS>
in

the

I
be
pronounce
to

request
to
look
in

glass

do
so
with

with
more
fear

turn
away

stand

calm
at

for
the
rest
;
the

be
make
with
extreme
simplicity

guiltless
of

it
be
but
the
light
fabric

bright
tint
which
scare
me

and
since

find
in
it
nothing

my

consent
soon

<EOS>
I
suppose
people
who
go
every
night
to
place
of
public
amusement
,
can
hardly
enter
into
the
fresh
gala
feeling
with
which
an
opera
or
a
concert
be
enjoy
by
those
for
whom
it
be
a
rarity
:
I
be
not
sure
that
I
expect
great
pleasure
from
the
concert
,
have
but
a
very
vague
notion
of
its
nature
,
but
I
like
the
drive
there
well
.
<EOS>
the
snug
comfort
of
the
close
carriage
on
a
cold
though
fine
night
,
the
pleasure
of
set
out
with
companion
so
cheerful
and
friendly
,
the
sight
of
the
star
glint
fitfully
through
the
tree
as
we
roll
along
the
avenue
;
then
the
free
burst
of
the
night
-
sky
when
we
issue
forth
to
the
open
chaussée
,
the
passage
through
the
city
gate
,
the
light
there
burn
,
the
guard
there
post
,
the
pretence
of
inspection
,
to
which
we
there
submit
,
and
which
amuse
us
so
much
 
<EOS>
all
these
small
matter
have
for
me
,
in
their
novelty
,
a
peculiarly
exhilarate
charm
.
<EOS>
how
much
of
it
lie
in
the
atmosphere
of
friendship
diffuse
about
me
<EOS>
,
I
know
not
:
Dr.
John
and
his
mother
be
both
in
their
fine
mood
,
contend
animatedly
with
each
other
the
whole
way
,
and
as
frankly
kind
to
me
as
if
I
have
be
of
their
kin
.
  
<EOS>
Our
way
lie
through
some
of
the
good
street
of
Villette
,
street
brightly
light
,
and
far
more
lively
now
than
at
high
noon
.
<EOS>
how
brilliant
seem
the
shop
!
<EOS>
how
glad
,
gay
,
and
abundant
flow
the
tide
of
life
along
the
broad
pavement
!
<EOS>
while
I
look
,
the
thought
of
the
Rue
Fossette
come
across
me
 
of
the
wall
-
in
garden
and
school
-
house
,
and
of
the
dark
,
vast
"
class
,
"
where
,
as
at
this
very
hour
,
it
be
my
will
not
to
wander
all
solitary
,
gaze
at
the
star
through
the
high
,
blindless
window
,
and
listen
to
the
distant
voice
of
the
reader
in
the
refectory
,
monotonously
exercise
upon
the
"
lecture
pieuse
.
"
<EOS>
thus
must
I
soon
again
listen
and
wander
;
and
this
shadow
of
the
future
stole
with
timely
sobriety
across
the
radiant
present
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
we
have
get
into
a
current
of
carriage
all
tend
in
one
direction
,
and
soon
the
front
of
a
great
illuminate
building
blaze
before
us
.
<EOS>
of
what
I
should
see
within
this
building
,
I
have
,
as
before
intimate
,
but
an
imperfect
idea
;
for
no
place
of
public
entertainment
have
it
ever
be
my
lot
to
enter
yet
.
  
<EOS>
We
alight
under
a
portico
where
there
be
a
great
bustle
and
a
great
crowd
,
but
I
do
not
distinctly
remember
further
detail
,
until
I
find
myself
mount
a
majestic
staircase
wide
and
easy
of
ascent
,
deeply
and
softly
carpet
with
crimson
,
lead
up
to
great
door
close
solemnly
,
and
whose
panel
be
also
crimson
-
clothed
.
  
<EOS>
I
hardly
notice
by
what
magic
these
door
be
make
to
roll
back
 
<EOS>
Dr.
John
manage
these
point
;
roll
back
they
do
,
however
,
and
within
be
disclose
a
hall
 
grand
,
wide
,
and
high
,
whose
sweeping
circular
wall
,
and
dome
hollow
ceiling
,
seem
to
me
all
dead
gold
(
thus
with
nice
art
be
it
stain
)
,
relieve
by
cornice
,
fluting
,
and
garlandry
,
either
bright
,
like
gold
burnished
,
or
snow
-
white
,
like
alabaster
,
or
white
and
gold
mingle
in
wreath
of
gilded
leave
and
spotless
lily
:
wherever
drapery
hung
,
wherever
carpet
be
spread
,
or
cushion
place
,
the
sole
colour
employ
be
deep
crimson
.
<EOS>
pendent
from
the
dome
,
flame
a
mass
that
dazzle
me
 
a
mass
,
I
think
,
of
rock
-
crystal
,
sparkle
with
facet
,
stream
with
drop
,
ablaze
with
star
,
and
gorgeously
tinge
with
dew
of
gem
dissolve
,
or
fragment
of
rainbow
shiver
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
the
chandelier
,
reader
,
but
for
me
it
seem
the
work
of
eastern
genii
<EOS>
:
I
almost
look
to
see
if
a
huge
,
dark
,
cloudy
hand
 
<EOS>
that
of
the
slave
of
the
Lamp
 
be
not
hover
in
the
lustrous
and
perfumed
atmosphere
of
the
cupola
,
guard
its
wondrous
treasure
.
  
<EOS>
We
move
on
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
<EOS>
at
all
conscious
whither
 
<EOS>
but
at
some
turn
we
suddenly
encounter
another
party
approach
from
the
opposite
direction
.
<EOS>
I
just
now
see
that
group
,
as
it
flash
 
upon
me
for
one
moment
.
<EOS>
a
handsome
middle
-
aged
lady
in
dark
velvet
;
a
gentleman
who
may
be
her
son
 
the
good
face
,
the
fine
figure
,
I
think
,
I
have
ever
see
;
a
third
person
in
a
pink
dress
and
black
lace
mantle
.
  
<EOS>
I
note
them
all
 
the
third
person
as
well
as
the
other
two
 
and
for
the
fraction
of
a
moment
believe
them
all
stranger
,
thus
receive
an
impartial
impression
of
their
appearance
.
<EOS>
but
the
impression
be
hardly
feel
and
not
fix
,
before
the
consciousness
that
I
face
a
great
mirror
,
fill
a
compartment
between
two
pillar
,
dispel
it
:
the
party
be
our
own
party
.
<EOS>
thus
for
the
first
,
and
perhaps
only
time
in
my
life
,
I
enjoy
the
"
giftie
"
of
see
myself
as
other
see
me
.
<EOS>
no
need
to
dwell
on
the
result
.
<EOS>
It
bring
a
jar
of
discord
,
a
pang
of
regret
;
it
be
not
flattering
,
yet
,
after
all
,
I
ought
to
be
thankful
;
it
may
have
be
bad
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
we
be
seat
in
place
command
a
good
general
view
of
that
vast
and
dazzling
,
but
warm
and
cheerful
hall
.
<EOS>
already
it
be
fill
,
and
fill
with
a
splendid
assemblage
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
the
woman
be
very
beautiful
,
but
their
dress
be
so
perfect
;
and
foreigner
,
even
such
as
be
ungraceful
in
domestic
privacy
,
seem
to
posse
the
art
of
appear
graceful
in
public
:
however
blunt
and
boisterous
those
every
-
day
and
home
movement
connect
with
peignoir
and
papillote
,
there
be
a
slide
,
a
bend
,
a
carriage
of
the
head
and
arm
,
a
mien
of
the
mouth
and
eye
,
keep
nicely
in
reserve
for
gala
use
 
always
bring
out
with
the
grande
toilette
,
and
duly
put
on
with
the
"
parure
.
"
  
<EOS>
some
fine
form
there
be
here
and
there
,
model
of
a
peculiar
style
of
beauty
;
a
style
,
I
think
,
never
see
in
England
;
a
solid
,
firm
-
set
,
sculptural
style
.
<EOS>
these
shape
have
no
angle
:
a
caryatid
in
marble
be
almost
as
flexible
;
a
phidian
goddess
be
not
more
perfect
in
a
certain
still
and
stately
sort
.
<EOS>
They
have
such
feature
as
the
dutch
painter
give
to
their
madonna
:
low
-
country
classic
feature
,
regular
but
round
,
straight
but
stolid
;
and
for
their
depth
of
expressionless
calm
,
of
passionless
peace
,
a
polar
snow
-
field
could
alone
offer
a
type
.
<EOS>
woman
of
this
order
need
no
ornament
,
and
they
seldom
wear
any
;
the
smooth
hair
,
closely
braid
,
supply
a
sufficient
contrast
to
the
smooth
cheek
and
brow
;
the
dress
can
not
be
too
simple
;
the
rounded
arm
and
perfect
neck
require
neither
bracelet
nor
chain
.
  
<EOS>
with
one
of
these
beauty
I
once
have
the
honour
and
rapture
to
be
perfectly
acquaint
:
the
inert
force
of
the
deep
,
settle
love
she
bear
herself
,
be
wonderful
;
it
could
only
be
surpass
by
her
proud
impotency
to
care
for
any
other
live
thing
.
<EOS>
of
blood
,
her
cool
vein
conduct
no
flow
;
placid
lymph
fill
and
almost
obstruct
her
artery
.
  
<EOS>
such
a
Juno
as
I
have
describe
sit
full
in
our
view
 
a
sort
of
mark
for
all
eye
,
and
quite
conscious
that
so
she
be
,
but
proof
to
the
magnetic
influence
of
gaze
or
glance
:
cold
,
rounded
,
blonde
,
and
beauteous
as
the
white
column
,
capitalle
with
gilding
,
which
rise
at
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
observe
that
Dr.
John
's
attention
be
much
draw
towards
her
,
I
entreat
him
in
a
low
voice
"
for
the
love
of
heaven
to
shield
well
his
heart
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
fall
in
love
with
_
that
_
lady
,
"
I
say
,
"
because
,
I
tell
you
beforehand
,
you
may
die
at
her
foot
,
and
she
would
not
love
you
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
how
do
you
know
that
the
spectacle
of
her
grand
insensibility
may
not
with
me
be
the
strong
stimulus
to
homage
?
<EOS>
the
sting
of
desperation
be
,
I
think
,
a
wonderful
irritant
to
my
emotion
:
but
"
(
shrug
his
shoulder
)
"
you
know
nothing
about
these
thing
;
I
will
address
myself
to
my
mother

<EOS>
Mamma

I
be
in
a
dangerous
way

"
  
<EOS>

Mrs.
Bretton

<EOS>
"
alas

the
cruelty

respond
her
son

<EOS>
"
never

have
a

one
of

it

all
of
a
sudden

you

most
secure

I
shall
go
forth
like
Jacob

Esau

or
any
other
patriarch

take
me
a
wife

perhaps
of
these
which

the
daughter
of
the
land

"
  
<EOS>

at
your

that

this

me
to
be
an
old
bachelor

<EOS>
what
a
jealous
old
lady
it
be

<EOS>
but
now
just
look
at
that
splendid
creature
in
the
pale
blue
satin
dress
,
and
hair
of
paler
brown
,
with
"
reflet
satinés

as
those

<EOS>
Would
you
not
feel
proud
,
mamma

if
I
be
to
bring
that
goddess
home
some
day
,
and
introduce
her
to
you
as
Mrs.
Bretton

junior
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
bring
no
goddess
to
La
Terrasse
:
that
little
château
will
not
contain
two

especially
if
the
second
be
of
the
height

bulk

and

mighty

wax

admirably

chair

<EOS>
I
defy
the
foreign
usurper

<EOS>
a
rueful

should
it
be
for
her
:
but
hush
,
John
Graham
!
<EOS>
hold
your
tongue
,
and
use
your
eye

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
during
the
above
skirmish
,
the
hall
,
which
,
I
have
think
,
seem
full
at
the
entrance
,
continue
to
admit
party
after
party
,
until
the
semicircle
before
the
stage
present
one
dense
mass
of
head
,
slope
from
floor
to
ceiling
.
<EOS>
the
stage
,
too
,
or
rather
the
wide
temporary
platform
,
large
than
any
stage
,
desert
half
an
hour
since
,
be
now
overflow
with
life
;
round
two
grand
piano
,
place
about
the
centre
,
a
white
flock
of
young
girl
,
the
pupil
of
the
Conservatoire
,
have
noiselessly
pour
.
<EOS>
I
have
notice
their
gathering
,
while
Graham
and
his
mother
be
engage
in
discuss
the
belle
in
blue
satin
,
and
have
watch
with
interest
the
process
of
array
and
marshal
them
.
<EOS>
two
gentleman
,
in
each
of
whom
I
recognise
an
acquaintance
,
officer
this
virgin
troop
.
<EOS>
one
,
an
artistic
-
looking
man
,
bearded
,
and
with
long
hair
,
be
a
noted
pianiste
,
and
also
the
first
music
-
teacher
in
Villette
;
he
attend
twice
a
week
at
Madame
Beck
's
pensionnat
,
to
give
lesson
to
the
few
pupil
whose
parent
be
rich
enough
to
allow
their
daughter
the
privilege
of
his
instruction
;
his
name
be
M.
Josef
Emanuel
,
and
he
be
half
-
brother
to
M.
Paul
:
which
potent
personage
be
now
visible
in
the
person
of
the
second
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
M.
Paul
amuse
me
;
I
smile
to
myself
as
I
watch
him
,
he
seem
so
thoroughly
in
his
element
 
stand
conspicuous
in
presence
of
a
wide
and
grand
assemblage
,
arranging
,
restrain
,
over
-
aweing
about
one
hundred
young
lady
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
too
,
so
perfectly
in
earnest
 
so
energetic
,
so
intent
,
and
,
above
all
,
so
absolute
:
<EOS>
and
yet
what
business
have
he
there
?
<EOS>
what
have
he
to
do
with
music
or
the
Conservatoirehe
who
could
hardly
distinguish
one
note
from
another
?
<EOS>
I
know
that
it
be
his
love
of
display
and
authority
which
have
bring
him
there
 
a
love
not
offensive
,
only
because
so
naive
.
<EOS>
It
presently
become
obvious
that
his
brother
,
M.
Josef
,
be
as
much
under
his
control
as
be
the
girl
themselves
.
<EOS>
never
be
such
a
little
hawk
of
a
man
as
that
M.
Paul
!
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
some
note
singer
and
musician
dawn
upon
the
platform
:
as
these
star
rise
,
the
comet
-
like
professor
set
.
<EOS>
insufferable
to
him
be
all
notoriety
and
celebrity
:
where
he
could
not
outshine
,
he
flee
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
all
be
prepared
:
but
one
compartment
of
the
hall
wait
to
be
fill
 
a
compartment
cover
with
crimson
,
like
the
grand
staircase
and
door
,
furnish
with
stuff
and
cushion
bench
,
range
on
each
side
of
two
regal
chair
,
place
solemnly
under
a
canopy
.
  
<EOS>
a
signal
be
give
,
the
door
roll
back
,
the
assembly
stand
up
,
the
orchestra
burst
out
,
and
,
to
the
welcome
of
a
choral
burst
,
enter
the
King
,
the
Queen
,
the
Court
of
Labassecour
.
  
<EOS>
till
then
,
I
have
never
set
eye
on
live
king
or
queen
;
it
may
consequently
be
conjecture
how
I
strain
my
power
of
vision
to
take
in
these
specimen
of
european
royalty
.
<EOS>
by
whomsoever
majesty
be
beheld
for
the
first
time
,
there
will
always
be
experience
a
vague
surprise
border
on
disappointment
,
that
the
same
do
not
appear
seat
,
en
permanence
,
on
a
throne
,
bonnet
with
a
crown
,
and
furnish
,
as
to
the
hand
,
with
a
sceptre
.
<EOS>
look
out
for
a
king
and
queen
,
and
see
only
a
middle
-
aged
soldier
and
a
rather
young
lady
,
I
feel
half
cheated
,
half
pleased
.
  
<EOS>
well
do
I
recall
that
King
 
<EOS>
a
man
of
fifty
,
a
little
bowed
,
a
little
grey
:
there
be
no
face
in
all
that
assembly
which
resemble
his
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
read
,
never
be
tell
anything
of
his
nature
or
his
habit
;
and
at
first
the
strong
hieroglyphic
grave
as
with
iron
stylet
on
his
brow
,
round
his
eye
,
beside
his
mouth
,
puzzle
and
baffle
instinct
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
however
,
if
I
do
not
know
,
at
least
I
feel
,
the
meaning
of
those
character
write
without
hand
.
<EOS>
there
sit
a
silent
sufferer
 
a
nervous
,
melancholy
man
.
<EOS>
those
eye
have
look
on
the
visit
of
a
certain
ghost
 
have
long
wait
the
coming
and
going
of
that
strange
spectre
,
Hypochondria
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
see
her
now
on
that
stage
,
over
against
him
,
amidst
all
that
brilliant
throng
.
<EOS>
Hypochondria
have
that
will
not
,
to
rise
in
the
midst
of
thousand
 
dark
as
Doom
,
pale
as
Malady
,
and
well
-
nigh
strong
as
death
.
<EOS>
Her
comrade
and
victim
think
to
be
happy
one
moment
 
"
not
so
,
"
say
she
;
"
I
come
.
"
<EOS>
and
she
freeze
the
blood
in
his
heart
,
and
becloud
the
light
in
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
some
may
say
it
be
the
foreign
crown
press
the
King
's
brow
which
bend
them
to
that
peculiar
and
painful
fold
;
some
may
quote
the
effect
of
early
bereavement
.
<EOS>
something
there
may
be
of
both
these
;
but
these
be
embitter
by
that
dark
foe
of
humanity
 
constitutional
melancholy
.
<EOS>
the
Queen
,
his
wife
,
know
this
:
<EOS>
it
seem
to
me
,
the
reflection
of
her
husband
's
grief
lie

<EOS>
a

graceful
woman

not

not
at

the
woman
of
solid
charm
and

feeling

a

two
since

<EOS>
Hers
be
a
somewhat
slend
shape
;
her
feature
,
though
distinguish
enough
,
be
too
suggestive
of
reign
dynasty
and
royal
line
to
give
unqualified
pleasure
.
<EOS>
the

clothing

agreeable

you

not

connect
it
with

under

ignoble

feeble

bless
it

<EOS>
She
move
no

a

kind

loving

elegant

<EOS>
Her
little
son
,
the
Prince
of
Labassecour
,
and
young
Duc
de
Dindonneau
,
accompany
her
:
he
lean
on
his
mother
's
knee
;
and
,
ever
and
anon
,
in
the
course
of
that
evening
,
I
see
her
observant
of
the
monarch
at
her
side
,
conscious
of
his
beclouded
abstraction
,
and
desirous
to
rouse
him
from
it
by
draw
his
attention
to
their
son
.
<EOS>
She
often
bend
her
head
to
listen
to
the
boy
's
remark
,
and
would
then
smilingly
repeat
them
to
his
sire
.
<EOS>
the
moody
King
start
,
listen
,
smile
,
but
invariably
relapse
as
soon
as
his
good
angel
cease
speak

<EOS>
full
mournful
and
significant
be
that
spectacle
!
<EOS>
not
the
less
so
because
,
both
for
the
aristocracy
and
the
honest
bourgeoisie
of
Labassecour
,
its
peculiarity
seem
to
be
wholly
invisible
:
I
could
not
discover
that
one

<EOS>
with

these

most

their

<EOS>
nor
be
this
splendour
without

in

the

in

seem
devoted
exclusively
to
young

<EOS>
perhaps
,
I

rather

the

<EOS>
here
be
a

of
Madame

Angélique

pupil

during

ought
to
have
be
in
the

class
,
but
whose

never

the
second
division

<EOS>
in
English

they
have
be
under
my

and
hard
work
<EOS>
it
be
to
get
them
to
translate
rationally
a

of
_
the
Vicar

<EOS>
also
during

one
of

<EOS>
be
a

only
by
the
fact
of

she
could
not

<EOS>
here
be
truth
 
wholesome
truth
,
too
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
another
of
these
seraph
 
the
prettiest
,
or
,
at
any
rate
,
the
least
demure
and
hypocritical
looking
of
the
lot
:
she
be
seat
by
the
daughter
of
an
English
peer
,
also
an
honest
,
though
haughty
-
looking
girl
:
both
have
enter
in
the
suite
of
the
british
embassy
.
<EOS>
She
(
_
i.e.
_
my
acquaintance
)
have
a
slight
,
pliant
figure
,
not
at
all
like
the
form
of
the
foreign
damsel
:
<EOS>
her
hair
,
too
,
be
not
close
-
braid
,
like
a
shell
or
a
skull
-
cap
of
satin
;
it
look
_
like
_
hair
,
and
wave
from
her
head
,
long
,
curled
,
and
flow
.
<EOS>
She
chat
away
volubly
,
and
seem
full
of
a
light
-
head
sort
of
satisfaction
with
herself
and
her
position
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
look
at
Dr.
Bretton
;
but
I
know
that
he
,
too
,
see
Ginevra
Fanshawe
<EOS>
:
he
have
become
so
quiet
,
he
answer
so
briefly
his
mother
's
remark
,
he
so
often
suppress
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
why
should
he
sigh
?
<EOS>
He
have
confess
a
taste
for
the
pursuit
of
love
under
difficulty
;
here
be
full
gratification
for
that
taste
.
<EOS>
His
lady
-
love
beam
upon
him
from
a
sphere
above
his
own
:
he
could
not
come
near
her
;
he
be
not
certain
that
he
could
win
from
her
a
look
.
<EOS>
I
watch
to
see
if
she
would
so
far
favour
him
.
<EOS>
Our
seat
be
not
far
from
the
crimson
bench
;
we
must
inevitably
be
see
thence
,
by
eye
<EOS>
so
quick
and
rove
as
Miss
Fanshawe
's
,
and
very
soon
those
optic
of
her
be
upon
us
:
at
least
,
upon
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Bretton
.
<EOS>
I
keep
rather
in
the
shade
and
out
of
sight
,
not
wish
to
be
immediately
recognise
:
she
look
quite
steadily
at
Dr.
John
,
and
then
she
raise
a
glass
to
examine
his
mother
;
a
minute
or
two
afterwards
she
laughingly
whisper
her
neighbour
;
upon
the
performance
commence
,
her
rambling
attention
be
attract
to
the
platform
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
concert
I
need
not
dwell
;
the
reader
would
not
care
to
have
my
impression
thereanent
:
and
,
indeed
,
it
would
not
be
worth
while
to
record
them
,
as
they
be
the
impression
of
an
ignorance
crasse
.
<EOS>
the
young
lady
of
the
Conservatoire
,
be
very
much
frightened
,
make
rather
a
tremulous
exhibition
on
the
two
grand
piano
.
<EOS>
M.
Josef
Emanuel
stand
by
them
while
they
play
;
but
he
have
not
the
tact
or
influence
of
his
kinsman
,
who
,
under
similar
circumstance
,
would
certainly
have
_
compel
_
pupil
of
his
to
demean
themselves
with
heroism
and
self
-
possession
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
would
have
place
the
hysteric
débutante
between
two
fire
 
terror
of
the
audience
,
and
terror
of
himself
 
and
would
have
inspire
them
with
the
courage
of
desperation
,
by
make
the
latter
terror
incomparably
the
great
:
M.
Josef
could
not
do
this
.
  
<EOS>
follow
the
white
muslin
pianiste
,
come
a
fine
,
full
-
grown
,
sulky
lady
in
white
satin
.
<EOS>
She
sing
.
<EOS>
Her
singing
just
affect
me
like
the
trick
of
a
conjuror
:
I
wonder
how
she
do
it
 
<EOS>
how
she
make
her
voice
run
up
and
down
,
and
cut
such
marvellous
caper
;
but
a
simple
Scotch
melody
,
play
by
a
rude
street
minstrel
,
have
often
move
me
more
deeply
.
  
<EOS>
afterwards
step
forth
a
gentleman
,
who
,
bend
his
body
a
good
deal
in
the
direction
of
the
King
and
Queen
,
and
frequently
approach
his
white
-
gloved
hand
to
the
region
of
his
heart
,
vent
a
bitter
outcry
against
a
certain
"
fausse
Isabelle
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
seem
especially
to
solicit
the
Queen
's
sympathy
;
but
,
unless
I
be
egregiously
mistaken
,
her
Majesty
lend
her
attention
rather
with
the
calm
of
courtesy
than
the
earnestness
of
interest
.
<EOS>
this
gentleman
's
state
of
mind
be
very
harrowing
,
and
I
be
glad
when
he
wind
up
his
musical
exposition
of
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
some
rouse
chorus
strike
me
as
the
good
part
of
the
evening
's
entertainment
.
<EOS>
there
be
present
deputy
from
all
the
good
provincial
choral
society
;
genuine
,
barrel
-
shape
,
native
Labassecouriens
.
<EOS>
these
worthy
give
voice
without
mince
the
matter
their
hearty
exertion
have
at
least
this
good
result
 
<EOS>
the
ear
drink
<EOS>
thence
a
satisfying
sense
of
power
.
  
<EOS>
through
the
whole
performance
 
timid
instrumental
duet
,
conceited
vocal
solo
,
sonorous
,
brass
-
lunge
chorus
 
<EOS>
my
attention
give
but
one
eye
and
one
ear
to
the
stage
,
the
other
be
permanently
retain
in
the
service
of
Dr.
Bretton
:
I
could
not
forget
him
,
nor
cease
to
question
how
he
be
feel
,
what
he
be
think
,
whether
he
be
amuse
or
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
how
do
you
like
it
all
,
Lucy
?
<EOS>
You
be
very
quiet
,
"
he
say
,
in
his
own
cheerful
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
quiet
,
"
I
say
,
"
because
I
be
so
very
,
_
<EOS>
very
_
much
interested
:
not
merely
with
the
music
,
but
with
everything
about
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
then
proceed
to
make
some
further
remark
,
with
so
much
equanimity
and
composure
that
I
begin
to
think
he
have
really
not
see
what
I
have
see
,
and
I
whisper
 
<EOS>
"
Miss
Fanshawe
be
here
:
have
you
notice
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
!
<EOS>
and
I
observe
that
you
notice
her
too
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
she
come
with
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
be
there
with
a
very
grand
party
.
<EOS>
yes
;
Ginevra
be
in
_
her
_
train
;
and
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
be
in
Lady
"
s
train
,
who
be
in
the
Queen
's
train

<EOS>
if
this
be
not
one
of
the
compact
little
minor
european
court
,
whose
very
formality
be
little
more
imposing
than
familiarity
,
and
whose
gala
grandeur
be

it
would
sound
all
very

Ginevra
see
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

so
do
I
think
so

<EOS>
I
have
have
my
eye
on
her
several
time
since
you
withdraw
yours
;
and
I
have
have
the
honour
of
witness
a
little
spectacle
which
you
be
spare

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
ask
what
;
I
wait
voluntary
information
,
which
be
presently
give
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Fanshawe
,
"
he
say
,
"
have
a
companion

<EOS>
I

her

call
me

<EOS>
She
be
a
proud

not

I

what

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
merely
myself
and
my
mother

<EOS>
as
to
me
it
be
all
very
natural

nothing

I
suppose
,
can
be
fairer
game
than
the
young
bourgeois
doctor

but
my

<EOS>
I
never

her
ridicule

<EOS>
do
you
know

the
curl

sarcastically

thus
direct

give
me
a
most
curious
sensation

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
think
nothing
of
it
,
Dr.
John
:
it
be
not
worth
while

<EOS>
if
Ginevra
be
in
a
giddy
mood

as
she
be
eminently
to

night

she
would
make
no
scruple
of
laugh
at
that
mild

pensive
Queen

or
that
melancholy
King

<EOS>
She
be
not

heedless
folly

nothing

have
not

accustomed

hem

<EOS>
there
be
your
mistake

<EOS>
"

to
speak
the
honest
truth

without
any
false
rant
or
assumed
romance
,
there
actually
be
a
moment
,
six
month
ago
,
when
I
think
her
divine
.
<EOS>
do
you
remember
our
conversation
about
the
present
?
<EOS>
I
be
not
quite
open
with
you
in
discuss
that
subject
:
<EOS>
the
warmth
with
which
you
take
it
up
amuse
me

<EOS>
by
way
of
have
the
full
benefit
of
your
light

I
allow
you
to
think
me
more
in
the
dark
than
I
really
be

<EOS>
It
be
that
test
of
the
present
which
first
prove
Ginevra
mortal
.
<EOS>
still
her
beauty
retain
its
fascination
:
three
day
 
three
hour
ago

I
be
very
much
her
slave

<EOS>
as
she
pass
me
to

night

triumphant
in
beauty
,
my
emotion
do
her
homage
;
but
for
one
luckless
sneer
,
I
should
yet
be
the
humblest
of
her
servant

<EOS>
She
may
have
scoff
at

me

,
and
,
while
wound

she
would
not

alienate
me

through

she

the

general
relaxation

the
pleasantest
imaginable
stir

commotion

the
white
flock

clear

half

a

dozen
assistant

remove
the
pianos

no

he
must
add
to
their
strength
his
own

<EOS>
the
redundancy
of
his
alertness
be
half
-
vex
,
half
-
ludicrous
:
in
my
mind
I
both
disapprove
and
deride
most
of
this
fuss

<EOS>
yet
,
in
the
midst
of
prejudice
and
annoyance
,
I
could
not
,
while
watch
,
avoid
perceive
a
certain
not
disagreeable
naïveté
in
all
he
do

say
;
nor
could
I
be
blind
to
certain
vigorous
characteristic
of
his
physiognomy
,
render
conspicuous
now
by
the
contrast
with
a
throng
of
tame
face
:
the
deep
,
intent
keenness
of
his
eye
,
the
power
of
his

pale

broad

full

mouth

He
lack

he

leave
her

glide
along
the
rank

young
lady

who
all
stand
up

to
each

her

Graham

take
precedence

find
the
night

keen

lift

let
us
re

enter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
do
not
easily
regain
our
seat
;
the
lottery
be
begin
,
and
all
be
excited
confusion
;
crowd
block
the
sort
of
corridor
along
which
we
have
to
pass
:
<EOS>
it
be
necessary
to
pause
for
a
time
.
<EOS>
happen
to
glance
round
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
half
fancy
<EOS>
I
hear
my
name
pronounce
 
<EOS>
I
see
quite
near
,
the
ubiquitous
,
the
inevitable
M.
Paul
.
<EOS>
He
be
look
at
me
gravely
and
intently
:
at
me
,
or
rather
at
my
pink
dress
 
sardonic
comment
on
which
gleam
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
now
it
be
his
habit
to
indulge
in
stricture
on
the
dress
,
both
of
the
teacher
and
pupil
,
at
Madame
Beck
's
 
a
habit
which
the
former
,
at
least
,
hold
to
be
an
offensive
impertinence
:
as
yet
I
have
not
suffer
from
it
 
my
sombre
daily
attire
not
be
calculate
to
attract
notice
.
<EOS>
I
be
in
no
mood
to
permit
any
new
encroachment
to
-
night
:
rather
than
accept
his
banter
,
I
would
ignore
his
presence
,
and
accordingly
steadily
turn
my
face
to
the
sleeve
of
Dr.
John
's
coat
;
find
in
that
same
black
sleeve
a
prospect
more
redolent
of
pleasure
and
comfort
,
more
genial
,
more
friendly
,
I
think
,
than
be
offer
by
the
dark
little
Professor
's
unlovely
visage
.
<EOS>
Dr.
John
seem
unconsciously
to
sanction
the
preference
by
look
down
and
say
in
his
kind
voice
,
"
ay
,
keep
close
to
my
side
,
Lucy
:
these
crowd
burgher
be
no
respecter
of
person

"
  
I
could
not
,
however
,
be
true
to
myself
.
<EOS>
yield
to
some
influence
,
mesmeric
or
otherwise
 
an
influence
unwelcome
,
displeasing
,
but
effective
 
<EOS>
I
again
glance
round
to
see
if
M.
Paul
be
go
.
<EOS>
no
,
there
he
stand
on
the
same
spot
,
look
still
,
but
with
a
changed
eye
;
he
have
penetrate
my
thought
,
and
read
my
wish
to
shun
him
.
<EOS>
the
mocking
but
not
ill
-
humoured
<EOS>
gaze
be
turn
to
a
swarthy
frown
,
and
when
I
bow
,
with
a
view
to
conciliation
,
I
get
only
the
stiff
and
sternest
of
nod
in
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
whom
have
you
make
angry
,
Lucy
?
"
whisper
Dr.
Bretton
,
smile
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
who
be
that
savage

looking
friend
of
yours

one
of
the
professor
at
Madame
Beck

a
very
cross
little
man

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
look
mighty
cross
just
now

what
have
you
do
to
him
?
<EOS>
what
be
it
all
about

<EOS>
ah
,
Lucy
,
Lucy

<EOS>
tell
me
the
meaning
of
this

"
  
<EOS>
"
no
mystery
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
be
very
exigeant
,
and
because
I
look
at
your
coat
-
sleeve
,
instead
of
curtseying
and
dip
to
him
,
he
think
I
have
fail
in
respect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
little
 
"
begin
Dr.
John
:
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
more
he
would
have
add
,
for
at
that
moment
I
be
nearly
throw
down
amongst
the
foot
of
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
have
rudely
push
past
,
and
be
elbow
his
way
with
such
utter
disregard
to
the
convenience
and
security
of
all
around
,
that
a
very
uncomfortable
pressure
be
the
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
be
what
he
himself
would
call
"
méchant
,
"
"
say
Dr.
Bretton
.
<EOS>
I
think
so
,
too
.
  
<EOS>
slowly
and
with
difficulty
we
make
our
way
along
the
passage
,
and
at
last
regain
our
seat
.
<EOS>
the
drawing
of
the
lottery
last
nearly
an
hour
;
it
be
an
animate
and
amusing
scene
;
and
as
we
each
hold
ticket
,
we
share
in
the
alternation
of
hope
and
fear
raise
by
each
turn
of
the
wheel
.
<EOS>
two
little
girl
,
of
five
and
six
year
old
,
draw
the
number
:
and
the
prize
be
duly
proclaim
from
the
platform
.
<EOS>
these
prize
be
numerous
,
though
of
small
value
.
<EOS>
It
so
fall
out
that
Dr.
John
and
I
each
gain
one
:
mine
be
a
cigar
-
case
,
his
a
lady
's
head
-
dress
 
a
most
airy
sort
of
blue
and
silver
turban
,
with
a
streamer
of
plumage
on
one
side
,
like
a
snowy
cloud
.
<EOS>
He
be
excessively
anxious
to
make
an
exchange
;
but
I
could
not
be
bring
to
hear
reason
,
and
to
this
day
I
keep
my
cigar
-
case
:
it
serve
,
when
I
look
at
it
,
to
remind
me
of
old
time
,
and
one
happy
evening
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
John
,
for
his
part
,
hold
his
turban
at
arm
's
length
between
his
finger
and
thumb
,
and
look
at
it
with
a
mixture
of
reverence
and
embarrassment
highly
provocative
of
laughter
.
<EOS>
the
contemplation
over
,
he
be
about
coolly
to
deposit
the
delicate
fabric
on
the
ground
between
his
foot
;
he
seem
to
have
no
shadow
of
an
idea
of
the
treatment
or
stowage
it
ought
to
receive
:
if
his
mother
have
not
come
to
the
rescue
,
I
think
he
would
finally
have
crush
it
under
his
arm
like
an
opera
-
hat
;
she
restore
it
to
the
band
-
box
whence
it
have
issue
.
  
<EOS>
Graham
be
quite
cheerful
all
the
evening
,
and
his
cheerfulness
seem
natural
and
unforced
.
<EOS>
His
demeanour
,
his
look
,
be
not
easily
describe
;
there
be
something
in
it
peculiar
,
and
,
in
its
way
,
original
.
<EOS>
I
read
in
it
no
common
mastery
of
the
passion
,
and
a
fund
of
deep
and
healthy
strength
which
,
without
any
exhausting
effort
,
bore
down
Disappointment
and
extract
her
fang
.
<EOS>
His
manner
,
now
,
remind
me
of
quality
I
have
notice
in
him
when
professionally
engage
amongst
the
poor
,
the
guilty
,
and
the
suffering
,
in
the
Basse
-
Ville
:
he
look
at
once
determine
,
enduring
,
and
sweet
-
tempered
.
<EOS>
who
could
help
like
him
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
betray
no
weakness
which
harass
all
your
feeling
with
consideration
as
to
how
its
faltering
must
be
prop
;
from
_
him
_
break
no
irritability
which
startle
calm
and
quench
mirth
;
<EOS>
_
his
_
lip
let
fall
no
caustic
that
burn
to
the
bone
;
_
his
_
eye
shoot
no
morose
shaft
that
go
cold
,
and
rusty
,
and
venome
through
your
heart
:
beside
him
be
rest
and
refuge
 
around
him
,
foster
sunshine
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
he
have
neither
forgive
nor
forget
Miss
Fanshawe
.
<EOS>
once
anger
,
I
doubt
if
Dr.
Bretton
be
to
be
soon
propitiate
 
once
alienated
,
whether
he
be
ever
to
be
reclaim
.
<EOS>
He
look
at
her
more
than
once
;
not
stealthily
or
humbly
,
but
with
a
movement
of
hardy
,
open
observation
.
<EOS>
De
Hamal
be
now
a
fixture
beside
her
;
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
sit
near
,
and
they
and
she
be
wholly
absorb
in
the
discourse
,
mirth
,
and
excitement
,
with
which
the
crimson
seat
be
as
much
astir
as
any
plebeian
part
of
the
hall
.
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
some
apparently
animate
discussion
,
Ginevra
once
or
twice
lift
her
hand
and
arm
;
a
handsome
bracelet
gleam
upon
the
latter
.
<EOS>
I
see
that
its
gleam
flicker
in
Dr.
John
's
eye
 
quicken
therein
a
derisive
,
ireful
sparkle
;
he
laugh
:
    
"
I
think
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
will
lay
my
turban
on
my
wonte
altar
of
offering
;
there
,
at
any
rate
,
it
would
be
certain
to
find
favour
:
<EOS>
no
grisette
have
a
more
facile
faculty
of
acceptance
.
<EOS>
strange
!
<EOS>
for
after
all
,
I
know
she
be
a
girl
of
family
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
do
not
know
her
education
,
Dr.
John
,
"
say
I.
<EOS>
"
toss
about
all
her
life
from
one
foreign
school
to
another
,
she
may
justly
proffer
the
plea
of
ignorance
in
extenuation
of
most
of
her
fault
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
from
what
she
say
,
I
believe
her
father
and
mother
be
bring
up
much
as
she
have
be
bring
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
understand
she
have
no
fortune
;
and
once
I
have
pleasure
in
the
thought
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
tell
me
,
"
I
answer
,
"
that
they
be
poor
at
home
;
she
always
speak
quite
candidly
on
such
point
:
you
never
find
her
lying
,
as
these
foreigner
will
often
lie
.
<EOS>
Her
parent
have
a
large
family
:
they
occupy
such
a
station
and
possess
such
connection
as
,
in
their
opinion
,
demand
display
;
stringent
necessity
of
circumstance
and
inherent
thoughtlessness
of
disposition
combine
,
have
engender
reckless
unscrupulousness
as
to
how
they
obtain
the
mean
of
sustain
a
good
appearance
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
state
of
thing
,
and
the
only
state
of
thing
,
she
have
see
from
childhood
upward
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
 
<EOS>
and
I
think
to
mould
her
to
something
well
:
<EOS>
but
,
Lucy
,
to
speak
the
plain
truth
,
I
have
feel
a
new
thing
to
-
night
,
in
look
at
her
and
de
Hamal
.
<EOS>
I
feel
it
before
notice
the
impertinence
direct
at
my
mother
.
<EOS>
I
see
a
look
interchange
between
them
immediately
after
their
entrance
,
which
throw
a
most
unwelcome
light
on
my
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
You
have
be
long
aware
of
the
flirtation
they
keep
up
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
flirtation
!
<EOS>
that
may
be
an
innocent
girlish
wile
to
lure
on
the
true
lover
;
but
what
I
refer
to
be
not
flirtation
:
it
be
a
look
mark
mutual
and
secret
understanding
 
it
be
neither
girlish
nor
innocent
.
<EOS>
no
woman

be
she
as
beautiful
as
Aphrodite
,
who
could
give
or
receive
such
a
glance
,
shall
ever
be
seek
in
marriage
by
me

<EOS>
I
would
rather
we
would
a
paysanne
in
a
short
petticoat
and
high
cap
 
and
be
sure
that
she
be
honest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
smile
.
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
he
now
exaggerate
the
case
:
<EOS>
Ginevra
,
I
be
certain
,
be
honest
enough
,
with
all
her
giddiness
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
so
.
<EOS>
He
shake
his
head
,
and
say
he
would
not
be
the
man
to
trust
her
with
his
honour
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
only
thing
,
"
say
I
,
"
with
which
you
may
safely
trust
her
.
<EOS>
She
would
unscrupulously
damage
a
husband
's
purse
and
property
,
recklessly
try
his
patience
and
temper
<EOS>
:
I
do
not

let
another
breathe

<EOS>

You

I

so

I

I
can
not

be
severe

the
King

I
like

queen

Mamma

her

I
would
undertake
to
sit
you
out

leave

It

away

you
may
laugh
at

as
much

,
for

I
shall
take

<EOS>
which
she
do
accordingly

<EOS>
I
offer
to
relieve
her

shake
off
with
kindly
contempt

my

opine
that
I

us
a
lane
through

<EOS>
Graham
follow
,
apostrophize
his
mother
as
the
most
flourishing
grisette
it
have
ever
be
his
good
fortune
to
see
charge
with
carriage
of
a
bandbox
;
he
also
desire
me
to
mark
her
affection
for
the
sky
-
blue
turban
,
and
announce
his
conviction
that
she
intend
one
day
to
wear
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
night
be
now
very
cold
and
very
dark
,
but
with
little
delay
we
find
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
soon
we
be
pack
in
it
,
as
warm
and
as
snug
as
at
a
fire
-
side
;
and
the
drive
home
be
,
I
think
,
still
pleasanter
than
the
drive
to
the
concert
.
<EOS>
pleasant
it
be
,
even
though
the
coachman
 
have
spend
in
the
shop
of
a
"
marchand
de
vin
"
a
portion
of
the
time
we
pass
at
the
concert
 
drive
us
along
the
dark
and
solitary
chaussée
far
past
the
turn
lead
down
to
La
Terrasse
;
we
,
who
be
occupy
in
talk
and
laugh
,
not
notice
the
aberration
till
,
at
last
,
Mrs.
Bretton
intimate
that
,
though
she
have
always
think
the
château
a
retire
spot
<EOS>
,
she
do
not
know
it
be
situate
at
the
world
's
end

as
she
declare
seem
now
to
be
the
case

for
she
believe
we
have
be
an
hour
and
a
half
en
route
,
and
have
not
yet
take
the
turn
down
the
avenue

<EOS>
then
Graham
look
out
,
and
perceive
only
dim
-
spread
field
,
with
unfamiliar
row
of
pollard
and
lime
range
along
their
else
invisible
sunk

fence

begin
to
conjecture
how
matter
be

call
a
halt

he
mount
the

himself

<EOS>
thank
to
him
,

arrive
safe
at
home
about
an
hour

a
half
beyond
our

<EOS>
Martha
have
not

us
;
a
cheerful
fire
be
burn

a
neat
supper
spread
in

I
take
off
my

dress

lace
mantle
with
happy
feeling

I
have
experience
in
put
them
on
.
<EOS>
not
all
,
perhaps
,
who
have
shine
brightly
array
at
that

<EOS>
yet
three
day
,
and
then
I
must
go
back
to
the

<EOS>
I
almost
number
the
moment
of
these
day
upon
the
clock
;
fain
would
I
have
retard
their
flight
;
but
they
glide
by
while
I
watch
them
:
they
be
already
go
while
I
yet
fear
their
departure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
will
not
leave
us
to

day
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bretton
,
coaxingly
at
breakfast
;
"
she
know
we
can
procure
a
second
respite
.

<EOS>
"
I
would
not
ask
for
one
if
I
may
have
it
for
a

"
say
I.
<EOS>
"
I
long
to
get
the
good
-
by
over
,
and
to
be
settle
in
the
Rue
Fossette
again

<EOS>
I
must
go
this
morning
:
I
must
go
directly
;
my
trunk
be
pack

cord

"
  
<EOS>
It
appear
;
however
,
that
my
going
depend
upon
Graham
;
he
have
say
he
would
accompany
,
me
,
and
it
so
fall
out
that
he
be
engage
all
day
,
and
only
return
home
at
dusk
.
<EOS>
then
ensue
a
little
combat
of
word
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
and
her
son
press
me
to
remain
one
night
more
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
cry
,
so
irritated
and
eager
be
I
to
be
go
.
<EOS>
I
long
to
leave
them
as
the
criminal
on
the
scaffold
long
for
the
axe
to
descend
:
that
is
,
I
wish
the
pang
over
.
<EOS>
how
much
I
wish
it
,
they
could
not
tell
.
<EOS>
on
these
point
,
mine
be
a
state
of
mind
out
of
their
experience
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
dark
when
Dr.
John
hand
me
from
the
carriage
at
Madame
Beck
's
door
.
<EOS>
the
lamp
above
be
light
;
it
rain
a
November
drizzle
,
as
it
have
rain
all
day
:
the
lamplight
gleam
on
the
wet
pavement
.
<EOS>
just
such
a
night
be
it
as
that
on
which
,
not
a
year
ago
,
I
have
first
stop
at
this
very
threshold
;
just
similar
be
the
scene
.
<EOS>
I
remember
the
very
shape
of
the
paving
-
stone
which
I
have
note
with
idle
eye
,
while
,
with
a
thick
-
beat
heart
,
I
wait
the
unclosing
of
that
door
at
which
I
stand
 
a
solitary
and
a
suppliant
.
<EOS>
on
that
night
,
too
,
I
have
briefly
meet
him
who
now
stand
with
me
.
<EOS>
have
I
ever
remind
him
of
that
rencontre
,
or
explain
it
?
<EOS>
I
have
not
,
nor
ever
feel
the
inclination
to
do
so
<EOS>
:
it
be
a
pleasant
thought
,
lay
by
in
my
own
mind
,
and
best
keep
there
.
  
<EOS>
Graham
ring
the
bell
.
<EOS>
the
door
be
instantly
open
,
for
it
be
just
that
period
of
the
evening
when

half

boarder

their
departure

consequently

Rosine

on
the
alert

"
do
not
come
in

say
I
to
him
;
but
he
step
a
moment
into
the
well
-
light
vestibule
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
wish
him
to
see
that
"
the
water
stand
in
my
eye
,
"
for
his
<EOS>
be
too
kind
a
nature
ever
to
be
needlessly
show
such
sign
of
sorrow
.

He
always
wish
to
heal
 
to
relieve
 
when
,
physician
as
he
be

neither
cure
nor
alleviation

perhaps

never

<EOS>
this
hag

this

would
not

the

death

steadily
through

<EOS>
reason
may
be
right
;
yet
no
wonder
we
be
glad
at

to
defy
her

to
rush
from

terrible
revenge

<EOS>
reason
be
vindictive
as
a

for
me

be
always
envenom
as
a

mother

<EOS>
if
I
have
obey
her
it
have
chiefly
be
with
the
obedience

not

<EOS>
long

I
should

her
stint

her

often

nothing
more

harshly

my

<EOS>
then
,
look
up

have
I
see
in
the
sky
a

amidst
circle
star

of
which
the

brightest
lend
a
ray
sympathetic

<EOS>
a

soft

have
descend
with
quiet

<EOS>
She
keep
her
word
,
and
watch
me
through
a
night
's
rest
;
but
at
dawn
Reason
relieve
the
guard
.
<EOS>
I
awake
with
a
sort
of
start
;
the
rain
be
dash
against
the
pane
,
and
the
wind
utter
a
peevish
cry
at
interval
;
the
night
-
lamp
be
die
on
the
black
circular
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
dormitory
<EOS>
:
day
have
already
break
.
<EOS>
how
I
pity
those
whom
mental
pain
stun
instead
of
rouse
!
<EOS>
this
morning
the
pang
of
wake
snatch
me
out
of
bed
like
a
hand
with
a
giant
's
gripe
.
<EOS>
how
quickly
I
dress
in
the
cold
of
the
raw
dawn
!
<EOS>
how
deeply
I
drink
of
the
ice
-
cold
water
in
my
carafe
!
<EOS>
this
be
always
my
cordial
,
to
which
,
like
other
dram
-
drinker
,
I
have
eager
recourse
when
unsettle
by
chagrin
.
  
<EOS>
Ere
long
the
bell
ring
its
_
réveillée
_
to
the
whole
school
.
<EOS>
be
dress
,
I
descend
alone
to
the
refectory
,
where
the
stove
be
light
and
the
air
be
warm
;
through
the
rest
of
the
house
it
be
cold
,
with
the
nip
severity
of
a
continental
winter
:
though
now
<EOS>
but
the
beginning
of
November
,
a
north
wind
have
thus
early
bring
a
wintry
blight
over
Europe
<EOS>
:
I
remember
the
black
stove
please
me
little
when
I
first
come
;
but
now
I
begin
to
associate
with
them
a
sense
of
comfort
,
and
like
them
,
as
in
England
we
like
a
fireside
.
  
<EOS>
sit
down
before
this
dark
comforter
,
I
presently
fall
into
a
deep
argument
with
myself
on
life
and
its
chance
,
on
destiny
and
her
decree
.
<EOS>
My
mind
,
calmer
and
strong
now
than
last
night
,
make
for
itself
some
imperious
rule
,
prohibit
under
deadly
penalty
all
weak
retrospect
of
happiness
past
;
command
a
patient
journeying
through
the
wilderness
of
the
present
,
enjoin
a
reliance
on
faith
 
a
watching
of
the
cloud
and
pillar
which
subdue
while
they
guide
,
and
awe
while
they
illumine
 
hush
the
impulse
to
fond
idolatry
,
check
the
longing
out
-
look
for
a
far
-
off
promise
land
whose
river
be
,
perhaps
,
never
to
be
,
reach
save
in
die
dream
,
whose
sweet
pasture
be
to
be
view
but
from
the
desolate
and
sepulchral
summit
of
a
Nebo
.
  
<EOS>
by
degree
,
a
composite
feeling
of
blended
strength
and
pain
wound
itself
wirily
round
my
heart
,
sustain
,
or
at
least
restrained
,
its
throbbing
,
and
make
me
fit
for
the
day
's
work
.
<EOS>
I
lift
my
head
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
say
before
,
I
be
sit
near
the
stove
,
let
into
the
wall
beneath
the
refectory
and
the
carré
,
and
thus
suffice
to
heat
both
apartment
.
<EOS>
pierce
the
same
wall
,
and
close
beside
the
stove
,
be
a
window
,
look
also
into
the
carré
;
as
I
look
up
a
cap
-
tassel
,
a
brow
,
two
eye
,
fill
a
pane
of
that
window
;
the
fix
gaze
of
those
two
eye
hit
right
against
my
own
glance
:
they
be
watch
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
till
that
moment
know
that
tear
be
on
my
cheek
,
but
I
feel
them
now
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
strange
house
,
where
no
corner
be
sacred
from
intrusion
,
where
not
a
tear
could
be
shed
,
nor
a
thought
ponder
,
but
a
spy
be
at
hand
to
note
and
to
divine
.
<EOS>
and
this
new
,
this
out
-
door
,
this
male
spy
,
what
business
have
bring
him
to
the
premise
at
this
unwonted
hour
?
<EOS>
what
possible
right
have
he
to
intrude
on
me
thus
?
<EOS>
no
other
professor
would
have
dare
to
cross
the
carré
before
the
class
-
bell
rang
.
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
take
no
account
of
hour
nor
of
claim
:
there
be
some
book
of
reference
in
the
first
-
class
library
which
he
have
occasion
to
consult
;
he
have
come
to
seek
it
:
on
his
way
he
pass
the
refectory
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
much
his
habit
to
wear
eye
before
,
behind
,
and
<EOS>
on
each
side
of
him
:
he
have
see
me
through
the
little
window
 
he
now
open
the
refectory
door
,
and
there
he
stand
.
  
<EOS>
"

pursue

"
You
be
at
once
mournful
and
mutinous

<EOS>
I
see
on
your
cheek
two
tear
which
I
know
be
hot
as
two
spark
,
and
salt
as
two
crystal
of
the

<EOS>
while
I
speak
you

me
strangely

<EOS>
Shall
I
tell
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
monsieur

I

I

my
mood

<EOS>
so
meek

neither
rebuff

perhaps
,
insult
could
ruffle
it

<EOS>
You
remind
me

then
,
of
a
young

wild
creature

new
catch

untamed

view
with
a
mixture
of
fire

fear
the
first
entrance

<EOS>
Unwarrantable
accost
!
 
<EOS>
rash
and
rude
if
address
to
a
pupil
;
to
a
teacher
inadmissible
.
<EOS>
He
think
to
provoke
a
warm
reply
;
I
have
see
him
vex
the
passionate
to
explosion
before
now
.
<EOS>
in
me
his
malice
should
find
no
gratification
;
I
sit
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
look
,
"
say
he
,
"
like
one
who
would
snatch
at
a
draught
of
sweet
poison
,
and
spurn
wholesome
bitter
with
disgust
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
I
never
like
bitter
;
nor
do
I
believe
them
wholesome

<EOS>
and
to
whatever
be
sweet
,
be
it
poison
or
food
,
you
can
not
,
at

,
deny
its
own
delicious
quality
 
sweetness
.
<EOS>
better
,
perhaps
,
to
die
quickly
a
pleasant
death

than
drag
on
long
a
charmless
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yet
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
should
take
your
bitter
dose
duly
and
daily
,
if
I
have
the
power
to
administer
it
;
and
,
as
to
the
well

beloved
poison
,
I
would
,
perhaps
,
break
the
very
cup
which
hold
it

"
  
<EOS>
I
sharply
turn
my
head
away
,
partly
because
his
presence
utterly
displease
me
,
and
partly
because
I
wish
to
shun
question
:

in
my
present
mood

the
effort

answer
should
overmaster
self

<EOS>

the

inquisitorial
curiosity
.
<EOS>
I
be
silent
.
<EOS>
He
come
into
the
room
,
sit
down
on
the
bench
about
two
yard
from
me
,
and
persevere
long
,
and
,
for
him
,
patiently
,
in
attempt
to
draw
me
into
conversation
 
<EOS>
attempt
necessarily
unavaile
,
because
I
_
could
_
not
talk
.
<EOS>
at
last
I
entreat
to
be
let
alone
.
<EOS>
in
utter
the
request
,
my
voice
falter
,
my
head
sink
on
my
arm
and
the
table
.
<EOS>
I
weep
bitterly
,
though
quietly
.
<EOS>
He
sit
a
while
longer
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
look
up
nor
speak
,
<EOS>
till
the
closing
door
and
his
retreat
step
tell
me
that
he
be
go
.
<EOS>
these
tear
prove
a
relief
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
time
to
bathe
my
eye
before
breakfast
,
and
I
suppose
I
appear
at
that
meal
as
serene
as
any
other
person
:
not
,
however
,
quite
as
jocund
-
look
as
the
young
lady
who
place
herself
in
the
seat
opposite
mine
,
fix
on
me
a
pair
of
somewhat
small
eye
twinkle
gleefully
,
and
frankly
stretch
across
the
table
a
white
hand
to
be
shake
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fanshawe
's
travel
,
gaiety
,
and
flirtation
agree
with
her
mightily
;
she
have
become
quite
plump
,
her
cheek
look
as
round
as
apple
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
her
last
in
elegant
evening
attire
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
she
look
less
charming
now
in
her
school
-
dress
,
a
kind
of
careless
peignoir
of
a
dark
-
blue
material
,
dimly
and
dingily
plaide
with
black
.
<EOS>
I
even
think
this
dusky
wrapper
give
her
charm
a
triumph
;
enhance
by
contrast
the
fairness
of
her
skin
,
the
freshness
of
her
bloom
,
the
golden
beauty
of
her
tress
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
you
be
come
back
,
Timon
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
Timon
be
one
of
her
dozen
name
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
know
how
often
I
have
want
you
in
this
dismal
hole
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
have
you
?
<EOS>
then
,
of
course
,
if
you
want
me
,
you
have
something
for
me
to
do
:
stocking
to
mend
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
give
Ginevra
a
minute
's
or
a
farthing
's
credit
for
disinterestedness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Crabbed
and
crusty
as
ever
!
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
expect
as
much
:
it
would
not
be
you
if
you
do
not
snub
one
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
come
,
grand
-
mother
<EOS>
,
I
hope
you
like
coffee
as
much
,
and
pistolet
as
little
as
ever
:
be
you
disposed
to
barter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
take
your
own
way
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
way
consist
in
a
habit
she
have
of
make
me
convenient
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
like
the
morning
cup
of
coffee
;
its
school
brewage
not
be
strong
or
sweet
enough
to
suit
her
palate
;
and
she
have
an
excellent
appetite
,
like
any
other
healthy
school
-
girl
,
for
the
morning
pistolet
or
roll
,
which
be
new
-
baked
and
very
good
,
and
of
which
a
certain
allowance
be
serve
to
each
.
<EOS>
this
allowance
be
more
than
I
need
,
I
give
half
to
Ginevra
;
never
vary
in
my
preference
,
though
many
other
use
to
covet
the
superfluity
;
and
she
in
return
would
sometimes
give
me
a
portion
of
her
coffee
.
<EOS>
this
morning
I
be
glad
of
the
draught
;
hunger
I
have
none
,
and
with
thirst
I
be
parch
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
why
I
choose
to
give
my
bread
rather
to
Ginevra
than
to
another
;
nor
why
,
if
two
have
to
share
the
convenience
of
one
drinking
-
vessel
,
as
sometimes
happen
 
for
instance
,
when
we
take
a
long
walk
into
the
country
,
and
halt
for
refreshment
at
a
farm
 
I
always
contrive
that
she
should
be
my
convive
,
and
rather
like
to
let
her
take
the
lion
's
share
,
whether
of
the
white
beer
,
the
sweet
wine
,
or
the
new
milk
:
<EOS>
so
it
be
,
however
,
and
she
know
it
;
and
,
therefore
,
while
we
wrangle
daily
,
we
be
never
alienated
.
  
<EOS>
after
breakfast
my
custom
be
to
withdraw
to
the
first
classe
,
and
sit
and
read
,
or
think
(
oftenest
the
latter
)
there
alone
,
till
the
nine
-
o'clock
bell
throw
open
all
door
,
admit
the
gather
rush
of
externe
and
demi
-
pensionnaire
,
and
give
the
signal
for
entrance
on
that
bustle
and
business
to
which
,
till
five
P.M.
,
there
be
no
relax
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
just
seat
this
morning
,
when
a
tap
come
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
,
Mademoiselle
,
"
say
a
pensionnaire
,
<EOS>
enter
gently
;
and
have
take
from
her
desk
some
necessary
book
or
paper
,
she
withdraw
on
tip
-
toe
,
murmur
as
she
pass
me
,
"
<EOS>
Que
mademoiselle
est
appliquée
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Appliquée
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
the
mean
of
application
be
spread
before
me
,
but
I
be
do
nothing
;
and
have
do
nothing
,
and
mean
to
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
thus
do
the
world
give
us
credit
for
merit
we
have
not
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
herself
deem
me
a
regular
bas
-
bleu
,
and
often
and
solemnly
use
to
warn
me
not
to
study
too
much
,
l
"
the
blood
should
all
go
to
my
head
.
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
everybody
in
the
Rue
Fossette
hold
a
superstition
that
"

be
learn
;
with
the
notable
exception
of
M.
Emanuel
,
who
,
by
mean
peculiar
to
himself
,
and
quite
inscrutable
to
me
,
have
obtain
a
not
inaccurate
inkling
of
my
real
qualification
,
and
use
to
take
quiet
opportunity
of
chuckle
in
my
ear
his
malign
glee
over
their
scant
measure
.
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
never
trouble
myself
about
this
penury
.
<EOS>
I
dearly
like
to
think
my
own
thought
;
I
have
great
pleasure
in
read
a
few
book
,
but
not
many
:
prefer
always
those
on
whose
style
or
sentiment
the
writer
's
individual
nature
be
plainly
stamp
;
flag
inevitably
over
characterless
book
,
however
clever
and
meritorious
:
perceive
well
that
,
as
far
as
my
own
mind
be
concern
,
God
have
limit
its
power
and
,
its
action
 
<EOS>
thankful
,
I
trust
,
for
the
gift
bestow
,
but
unambitious
of
high
endowment
,
not
restlessly
eager
after
high
culture
.
  
<EOS>
the
polite
pupil
be
scarcely

when
,
unceremoniously
,
without
tap
,
in
burst
a
second
intruder

<EOS>
have
I
be
blind
<EOS>
I
should
have
know
who
this
be

<EOS>
a
constitutional
reserve

by
this
time
tell
with
wholesome
and
,
for
me
,
commodious
effect
,
on
the
manner
of
my
co
-
inmate
;
rarely
do
I
now
suffer
from
rude
or
intrusive
treatment
.
<EOS>
when
I
first
come
,
it
would
happen
once
and
again
that
a
blunt
German
would
clap
me
on
the
shoulder
,
and
ask
me
to
run
a
race
;
or
a
riotous
Labassecourienne
seize
me
by
the
arm
and
drag
me
towards
the
playground
:
urgent
proposal
to
take
a
swing
at
the
"

"
or
to

formerly
also
of

but
all
these
little

have
cease
some

ago
 
cease
,
too
,
without
my
finding
it
necessary
to
be
at
the
trouble
of
point

blank
cut
them
short
.
<EOS>
I
have
now
no
familiar
demonstration
to
dread
or
endure
,
save
from
one
quarter
;
and
as
that

<EOS>
I
could
bear
it

You

<EOS>
say
she
;
but
she
obey
:
and
,
indeed
,
the
first
classe
be
my
territory
,
and
she
could
not
there
legally
resist
a
notice
of
quittance
from
me
.
  
<EOS>
yet
,
to
speak
the
truth
,
never
have
I
be
less
dissatisfied
with
her
than
I
be
then
.
<EOS>
there
be
pleasure
in
thinking
of
the
contrast
between
the
reality
and
my
description
 
to
remember
Dr.
John
enjoy
the
drive
home
,
eat
his
supper
with
relish
,
and
retire
to
rest
with
christian
composure
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
when
I
see
him
really
unhappy
that
I
feel
really
vexed
with
the
fair
,
frail
cause
of
his
suffering
.
     
<EOS>
a
fortnight
pass
;
I
be
get
once
more
inure
to
the
harness
of
school
,
and
lapse
from
the
passionate
pain
of
change
to
the
palsy
of
custom
.
<EOS>
one
afternoon
,
in
cross
the
carré
,
on
my
way
to
the
first
classe
,
where
I
be
expect
to
assist
at
a
lesson
of
"
style
and
literature
,
"
I
see
,
stand
by
one
of
the
long
and
large
window
,
Rosine
,
the
portress
.
<EOS>
Her
attitude
,
as
usual
,
be
quite
nonchalante
.
<EOS>
She
always
"
stand
at
ease
;
"
one
of
her
hand
rest
in
her
apron
-
pocket
,
the
other
at
this
moment
hold
to
her
eye
a
letter
,
whereof
Mademoiselle
coolly
peruse
the
address
,
and
deliberately
study
the
seal
.
  
<EOS>
a
letter
!
<EOS>
the
shape
of
a
letter
similar
to
that
have
haunt
my
brain
in
its
very
core
for
seven
day
past
.
<EOS>
I
have
dream
of
a
letter
last
night
.
<EOS>
strong
magnetism
draw
me
to
that
letter
now
;
yet
,
whether
I
should
have
venture
to
demand
of
Rosine
so
much
as
a
glance
at
that
white
envelope
,
with
the
spot
of
red
wax
in
the
middle
,
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
no
<EOS>
;
I
think
I
should
have
sneak
past
in
terror
of
a
rebuff
from
disappointment
:
my
heart
throb
now
as
if
I
already
hear
the
tramp
of
her
approach
.
<EOS>
nervous
mistake
!
<EOS>
It
be
the
rapid
step
of
the
Professor
of
Literature
measure
the
corridor
.
<EOS>
I
flee
before
him
.
<EOS>
Could
I
but
be
seat
quietly
at
my
desk
before
his
arrival
,
with
the
class
under
my
order
all
in
discipline
readiness
,
he
would
,
perhaps
,
exempt
me
from
notice
;
but
,
if
catch
linger
in
the
carré
,
I
should
be
sure
to
come
in
for
a
special
harangue
.
<EOS>
I
have
time
to
get
seat
,
to
enforce
perfect
silence
,
to
take
out
my
work
,
and
to
commence
it
amidst
the
profound
and
best
train
hush
,
ere
M.
Emanuel
enter
with
his
vehement
burst
of
latch
and
panel
,
and
his
deep
,
redundant
bow
,
prophetic
of
choler
.
  
<EOS>
as
usual
he
break
upon
us
like
a
clap
of
thunder
;
but
instead
of
flash
lightning
-
wise
from
the
door
to
the
estrade
,
his
career
halt
midway
at
my
desk
.
<EOS>
set
his
face
towards
me
and
the
window
,
his
back
to
the
pupil
and
the
room
,
he
give
me
a
look
 
<EOS>
such
a
look
as
may
have
license
me
to
stand
straight
up
and
demand
what
he
mean
 
a
look
of
scowling
distrust
.
  
<EOS>
"
Voilà
!
<EOS>
pour
vous
,
"
say
he
,
draw
his
hand
from
his
waist
-
coat
,
and
place
on
my
desk
a
letter
 
<EOS>
the
very
letter
I
have
see
in
Rosine
's
hand
 
<EOS>
the
letter
whose
face
of
enamel
white
and
single
Cyclop's
-
eye
of
vermilion
-
red
have
print
themselves
so
clear
and
perfect
on
the
retina
of
an
inward
vision
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
,
I
feel
it
to
be
the
letter
of
my
hope
,
the
fruition
of
my
wish
,
the
release
from
my
doubt
,
the
ransom
from
my
terror

<EOS>
this
letter
M.
Paul
,
with
his
unwarrantably
interfere
habit
,
have
take
from
the
portress
,
and
now
deliver
it
himself
.
  
<EOS>
I
may
have
be
angry
,
but
have
not
a
second
for
the
sensation
.
<EOS>
yes
:
I
hold
in
my
hand
not
a
slight
note
,
but
an
envelope
,
which
must
,
at
least
,
contain
a
sheet
:
<EOS>
it
feel
not
flimsy
,
but
firm
,
substantial
,
satisfying
.
<EOS>
and
here
be
the
direction
,
"
Miss
Lucy
Snowe

"
in
a
clean

clear

equal

decided
hand

here
be
the

untremulous

I
experience
a
happy
feeling
 
a
glad
emotion
which
go
warm
to
my
heart
,
and
run
lively
through
all
my
vein
.
<EOS>
for
once
a
hope
be
realize
.
<EOS>
I
hold
in
my
hand
a
morsel
of
real
solid
joy
:
not
a
dream
,
not
an
image
of
the
brain
,
not
one
of
those
shadowy
chance
imagination
picture
,
and
on
which
humanity
starve
but
can
not
live
;
not
a
mess
of
that
manna
I
drearily
eulogize
awhile
ago
 
<EOS>
which
,
indeed
,
at
first
melt
on
the
lip
with
an
unspeakable
and
preternatural
sweetness

but
which
,
in
the
end
,
our
soul
full
surely
loathe

long
deliriously
for
natural

earth

grow
food

wildly
pray
Heaven
's
spirit
to
reclaim
their
own
spirit

dew
and
essence
 
an
aliment
divine

but
for
mortal
deadly

<EOS>
It
be
neither
sweet
hail
nor
small
coriander
-
seed
 
neither
slight
wafer
,
nor
luscious
honey
,
I
have
light
on
;
it
be
the
wild

savoury
mess
of
the
hunter

and
salubrious
meat

<EOS>
forest

feed
or
desert

fresh

healthful

<EOS>
It
be
what
the
old
die
patriarch
demand
of
his
son
Esau
,
promise
in
requital
the
blessing
of
his
last
breath
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
godsend
;
and
I
inwardly
thank
the
God
who
have
vouchsafe
it
.
<EOS>
outwardly
I
only
thank
man
,
cry
,
"
thank

thank
you

Monsieur

<EOS>
Monsieur
curl
his
lip
,
give
me
a
vicious
glance
of
the
eye
,
and
strode
to
his
estrade
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
be
not
at
all
a
good
little
man
,
though
he
have
good
point
.
  
<EOS>
do
I
read
my
letter
there
and
then
?
<EOS>
do
I
consume
the
venison
at
once
and
with
haste
,
as
if
Esau
's
shaft
fly
every
day
?
  
<EOS>
I
know
better
.
<EOS>
the
cover
with
its
address
 
the
seal
,
with
its
three
clear
letter
 
be
bounty
and
abundance
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
I
steal
from
the
room
,
I
procure
the
key
of
the
great
dormitory
,
which
be
keep
lock
by
day
.
<EOS>
I
go
to
my
bureau
;
with
a
sort
of
haste
and
tremble
lest
Madame
should
creep
up
-
stair
and
spy
me
,
I
open
a
drawer
,
unlock
a
box
,
and
take
out
a
case
,
and
 
have
feast
my
eye
with
one
more
look
,
and
approach
the
seal
with
a
mixture
of
awe
and
shame
and
delight
,
to
my
lip
 
I
fold
the
untasted
treasure
,
yet
all
fair
and
inviolate
,
in
silver
paper

commit
it
to
the
case
,
shut
up
box
and
drawer
,
reclose
,
relocke
the
dormitory
,
and
return
to
class
,
feel
as
if
fairy
tale
be
true
,
and
fairy
gift
no
dream
.
<EOS>
strange
,
sweet
insanity
!
<EOS>
and
this
letter
,
the
source
of
my
joy
,
I
have
not
yet
read
:
do
not
yet
know
the
number
of
its
line

<EOS>
when
I
re
-
enter
the
schoolroom

behold
M.
Paul
rage
like
a
pestilence
!
<EOS>
some
pupil
have
not
speak
audibly
or
distinctly
enough
to
suit
his
ear
and
taste
,
and
now
she
and
other
be
weep
,
and
he
be
rave
from
his
estrade
,
almost
livid
.
<EOS>
curious
to
mention
,
as
I
appear
,
he
fall
on
me
.

be
I
the
mistress
of
these

do
I
profess
to
teach
them
the
conduct
befitting
lady

<EOS>
and
do
I
permit
<EOS>
and
,
he
doubt
not
,
encourage
them
to
strangle
their
mother

tongue
in
their
throat
,
to
mince
and
mash
it
between
their
tooth
,
as
if
they
have
some
base
cause
to
be
ashamed
of
the
word
they
utter
?
<EOS>
be
this
modesty
?
<EOS>
He
know
better
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
vile
pseudo
sentiment
 
<EOS>
the
offspring
or
the
forerunner
of
evil
.
<EOS>
rather
than
submit
to
this
mopping
and
mowing
,
this
mincing
and
grimacing
,
this
,
grind
of
a
noble
tongue
,
this
general
affectation
and
sickening
stubbornness
of
the
pupil
of
the
first
class
,
he
would
throw
them
up
for
a
set
of
insupportable
petite
maîtresse
,
and
confine
himself
to
teach
the
ABC
to
the
baby
of
the
third
division
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
what
could
I
say
to
all
this
?
<EOS>
really
nothing
;
and
I
hope
he
would
allow
me
to
be
silent
.
<EOS>
the
storm
recommence

<EOS>
"
every
answer
to
his
query
be
then
refuse

<EOS>
It
seem
to
be
consider
in
_
that

place
 
that
conceited
boudoir
of
a
first
classe

with
its
pretentious
book

case

its
green

baize
desk
,
its
rubbish
of
flower

stand
,
its
trash
of
framed
picture
and
map
,
and
its
foreign
surveillante
,
forsooth
!
 
<EOS>
it
seem
to
be
the
fashion
to
think
_
there
_
that
the
Professor
of
Literature
be
not
worthy
of
a
reply
!
<EOS>
these
be
new
idea
;
import
,
he
do
not
doubt
,
straight
from
"
la
Grande
Bretagne
:
"
they
savour
of
island
insolence
and
arrogance

<EOS>
lull
the
second
 
<EOS>
the
girl
,
not
one
of
whom
be
ever
know
to
weep
a
tear
for
the
rebuke
of
any
other
master
,
now
all
melt
like
snow
-
statue
before
the
intemperate
heat
of
M.
Emanuel
:
I
not
yet
much
shaken
,
sit
down
,
and
venture
to
resume
my
work
.
  
<EOS>
something
 
either
in
my
continue
silence
or
in
the
movement
of
my
hand
,
stitching
 
transport
M.
Emanuel
beyond
the
last
boundary
of
patience
<EOS>
;
he
actually
spring
from
his
estrade
.
<EOS>
the
stove
stand
near
my
desk
,
he
attack
it
;
the
little
iron
door
be
nearly
dash
from
its
hinge
,
the
fuel
be
make
to
fly

<EOS>
"
Est

ce
que

avez
l'intention

say
he
to
me
,
in
a
low

furious
voice
,
as
he
thus
outrage
,
under
pretence
of
arrange
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
time
to
soothe
him
a
little
if
possible
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mais
,
Monsieur
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
would
not
insult
you
for
the

<EOS>
I
remember
too
well
that
you
once
say
we
should
be
friend

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
intend
my
voice
to
falter
,
but
it
do
:
<EOS>
more
,
I
think
,
through
the
agitation
of
late
delight
than
in
any
spasm
of
present
fear
.
<EOS>
still
there
certainly
be
something
in
M.
Paul
's
anger
 
a
kind
of
passion
of
emotion
 
that
specially
tend
to
draw
tear
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
unhappy
,
nor
much
afraid
,
yet
I
weep
.
  
<EOS>
"
allon
,
allon
!
<EOS>
"
say
he
presently
,
look
round
and
see
the
deluge
universal

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
decidedly
I
be
a
monster
and
a
ruffian
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
one
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
"
he
add
,
"
<EOS>
but
if
I
have
twenty
,
I
would
offer
you
each
one
.
<EOS>
Your
teacher
shall
be
your
representative
.
<EOS>
here
,
Miss
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
he
take
forth
and
hold
out
to
me
a
clean
silk
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
now
a
person
who
do
not
know
M.
Paul
,
who
be
unused
to
him
and
his
impulse
,
would
naturally
have
bungle
at
this
offer
 
decline
accept
the
same
 
et
cetera
.
<EOS>
but
I
too
plainly
feel
this
would
never
do
:
the
slight
hesitation
would
have
be
fatal
to
the
incipient
treaty
of
peace
.
<EOS>
I
rise
and
meet
the
handkerchief
half
-
way
,
receive
it
with
decorum
,
wipe
therewith
my
eye
,
and
,
resume
my
seat
,
and
retain
the
flag
of
truce
in
my
hand
and
on
my
lap
,
take
especial
care
during
the
remainder
of
the
lesson
to
touch
neither
needle
nor
thimble
,
scissor
nor
muslin
.
<EOS>
many
a
jealous
glance
do
M.
Paul
cast
at
these
implement
;
he
hate
them
mortally
,
consider
sew
a
source
of
distraction
from
the
attention
due
to
himself
.
<EOS>
a
very
eloquent
lesson
he
give
,
and
very
kind
and
friendly
be
he
to
the
close
.
<EOS>
Ere
he
have
do
,
the
cloud
be
disperse
and
the
sun
shine
out
 
tear
be
exchange
for
smile
.
  
<EOS>
in
quit
the
room
he
pause
once
more
at
my
desk
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
your
letter
?
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
this
time
not
quite
fiercely
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not

read
it

Monsieur

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
it
be
too
good
to

at

you

<EOS>
the
guess
come
so
near
the
truth

I
could
not
prevent
a
suddenly

rise
warmth
in
my
face
from
reveal
as
much

<EOS>
"
You
promise
yourself

when
he
be
go
,
the
pupil
have
already
pour
out
of
the
schoolroom
into
the
berceau
,
and
thence
into
the
garden
and
court
to
take
their
customary
recreation
before
the
five
-
o'clock
dinner
,
I
stand
a
moment
thinking
,
and
absently
twist
the
handkerchief
round
my
arm
.
<EOS>
for
some
reason
 
gladden
,
I
think
,
by
a
sudden
return
of
the
golden
glimmer
of
childhood
,
rouse
by
an
unwonted
renewal
of
its
buoyancy
,
make
merry
by
the
liberty
of
the
closing
hour
,
and
,
above
all
,
solace
at
heart
by
the
joyous
consciousness
of
that
treasure
in
the
case
,
box
,
drawer
up

stair
,
 
<EOS>
I
fall
to
play
with
the
handkerchief
as
if
it
be
a
ball
,
cast
it
into
the
air
and
catch
it
 
as
it
fall

<EOS>
the
game
be
stop
by
another
hand
than
mine
-
a
hand
emerge
from
a
paletôt

sleeve
and
stretch
over
my
shoulder
;
it
catch
the
extemporise
plaything
and
bear
it
away
with
these
sullen
word
:
  
"
Je
vois
bien

et
de

"
  
<EOS>
really
that
little
man
be
dreadful
:
a

caprice

ubiquity

one

either
his

the
LETTER

<EOS>
when
all
be
still
in
the
house
;
when
dinner
be
over
and
the
noisy
recreation
-
hour
past
;
when
darkness
have
set
in

and

quiet
lamp
of

light
in

refectory

when

when

in

with

some
friend

I
then
glide
to
the
kitchen
,
beg
a
bougie
for
one
half

hour
for
a
particular
occasion

find
acceptance

who
answer

and
,
light
in

,
I
mount
noiseless
to
the
dormitory

<EOS>
Great
be
my
chagrin
to
find
in
that
apartment
a
pupil
go
to
bed
indispose
,
 
great
when
I
recognise
,
amid
the
muslin
nightcap
border

the
"
figure
chiffonnée
"
of
Mistress
Ginevra
Fanshawe
;
supine
at
this
moment
,
it
be
true
 
but
certain
to
wake
and
overwhelm
me
with
chatter
when
the
interruption
would
be
least
acceptable
:
indeed
,
as
I
watch
her
,
<EOS>
a
slight
twinkling
of
the
eyelid
warn
me
that
the
present
appearance
of
repose
may
be

a
ruse

assume
to
cover
sly
vigilance
over

Timon

movement
;
she
be
not

trust

<EOS>
and
I
have
so
wish
to
be
alone
,
just
to
read
my
precious
letter
in
peace
.
  
<EOS>
well

I
must
go

I
shut
the

I
place
my

dodder

mouldy
chest
of

I
put

there

Dr.

<EOS>
what
be
near

<EOS>
something
in
that
vast
solitary
garret
sound
strangely
.
<EOS>
most
surely
and
certainly
I
hear
,
as
it
seem
,
a
stealthy
foot
on
that
floor
:
a
sort
of
glide
out
from
the
direction
of
the
black
recess
haunt
by
the
malefactor
cloak
.
<EOS>
I
turn
:
my
light
be
dim
;
the
room
be
long
 
<EOS>
but
as
I
live
!
<EOS>
I
see
in
the
middle
of
that
ghostly
chamber
a
figure
all
black
and
white
;
the
skirt
straight
,
narrow
,
black
;
the
head
bandage
,
veiled
,
white
.
  
<EOS>
say
what
you
will
,
reader
 
tell
me
I
be
nervous
or
mad
;
affirm
that
I
be
unsettle
by
the
excitement
of
that
letter
;
declare
that
I
dream
;
this
<EOS>
I
vow
 
<EOS>
I
see
there
 
in
that
room
 
on
that
night
 
an
image
like
 
a
NUN
.
  
<EOS>
I
cry
out
;
I
sicken
.
<EOS>
have
the
shape
approach
me
I
may
have
swoon
.
<EOS>
It
recede
:
I
make
for
the
door
.
<EOS>
how
I
descend
all
the
stair
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
by
instinct
I
shun
the
refectory
,
and
shape
my
course
to
Madame
's
sitting
-
room
:
I
burst
in
.
<EOS>
I
say
    
"
there
be
something
in
the
grenier
;
I
have
be
there
:
I
see
something
.
<EOS>
go
and
look
at
it
,
all
of
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
all
of
you
;
"
for
the
room
seem
to
me
full
of
people
,
though
in
truth
there
be
but
four
present
:
Madame
Beck
;
her
mother
,
Madame
Kint
,
who
be
out
of
health
,
and
now
stay
with
her
on
a
visit
;
her
brother
,
M.
Victor
Kint
,
and
another
gentleman
,
who
,
when
I
enter
the
room
,
be
converse
with
the
old
lady
,
and
have
his
back
towards
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
My
mortal
fear
and
faintness
must
have
make
me
deadly
pale
.
<EOS>
I
feel
cold
and
shake
.
<EOS>
They
all
rise
in
consternation
;
they
surround
me
.
<EOS>
I
urge
them
to
go
to
the
grenier
;
the
sight
of
the
gentleman
do
me
good
and
give
me
courage
:
it
seem
as
if
there
be
some
help
and
hope
,
with
man
at
hand
.
<EOS>
I
turn
to
the
door
,
beckon
them
to
follow
.
<EOS>
They
want
to
stop
me
,
but
I
say
they
must
come
this
way
<EOS>
:
they
must
see
what
I
have
see
 
something
strange
,
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
garret
.
<EOS>
and
,
now
,
I
remember
my
letter
,
leave
on
the
drawer
with
the
light
.
<EOS>
this
precious
letter
!
<EOS>
flesh
or
spirit
must
be
defy
for
its
sake

<EOS>
I
fly
up

stair
,
hasten
the
faster
as
I
know
I
be
follow
:
they
be
oblige
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
Lo
!
<EOS>
when
I
reach
the
garret

door
,
all
within
be
dark
as
a
pit
:
the
light
be
out

<EOS>
happily
some
one
 
Madame
,
I
think
,
with
her
usual
calm
sense
 
have
bring
a
lamp
from
the
room
;
speedily
,
therefore
,
as
they
come
up
,
a
ray
pierce
the
opaque
blackness
.
<EOS>
there
stand
the
bougie
quench
on
the
drawer
;
but
where
be
the
letter

<EOS>
and
I
look
for

and
not
for
the
nun

<EOS>
"
My

I
pant
and
plain
,
almost
beside
myself

grope
on
the
floor

wring
my
hand
wildly

cruel

preternaturally

His

if

I
doubt

raillery
in

make
me
grave

I
fold
up

Graham
in

mood

<EOS>
just
now
there
be

it
grieve
me

not

him
good

I

calm

<EOS>
He
now
look
like
a
friend

indescribable
smile
and
sparkle
be
go
;
those
formidable
arch
curve

lip

nostril

eyebrow

be
depressed

attention
sober

<EOS>
won
to
confidence

I
tell
him
exactly
what
I
have
see

<EOS>
ere
<EOS>
now
I
have
narrate
to
him
the
legend
of
the
house
 
while
away
with
that
narrative
an
hour
of
a
certain
mild
October
afternoon
,
when
he
and
I
ride
through
Bois
l'Etang
.
  
<EOS>
He
sit
and
think
,
and
while
he
think
,
we
hear
them
all
come
down

stair

<EOS>
"
be
they
go
to
interrupt
?
"
<EOS>
say
he

glance
at
the
door
with
an
annoyed
expression
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
will
not
come
here
,

I
answer
;
for
we
be
in
the
little
salon
where
Madame
never
sit
in
the
evening
,
and
where
it
be
by
mere
chance
that
heat
be
still

in

<EOS>
They
pass
the
door

go
on
to
the

<EOS>
"
now

he
pursue
,
"
they
will
talk

so
on

nothing

with
secret
horror

in
there

glide
out

hour

think
it
a

on

continued
mental
conflict

happiness

what
do
such
advice
mean

<EOS>
happiness
be
not
a
potato

to
be
plant
in
mould

and
till
with
manure

<EOS>
happiness
be
a
glory
shine
far
down
upon
us
out
of
Heaven

<EOS>
She
be
a
divine
dew
which
the
soul
,
on
certain
of
its
summer
morning
,
feel
drop
upon
it
from
the
amaranth
bloom

golden
fruitage
of
Paradise

"
cultivate

I
say
briefly
to
the

:
"

how
do

in

liberty

more

a

disdain

it
,
and
accompany
his
"
good
-
night
.
"
     
<EOS>
and
have
there
be
anything
in
the
garret
?
<EOS>
what
do
they
discover
?
<EOS>
I
believe
,
on
the
close
examination
,
their
discovery
amount
to
very
little
.
<EOS>
They
talk
,
at
first
,
of
the
cloak
be
disturb
;
but
Madame
Beck
tell
me
afterwards
she
think
they
hang
much
as
usual
:
and
as
for
the
broken
pane
in
the
skylight
,
she
affirm
that
aperture
be
rarely
without
one
or
more
pane
break
or
crack
:
and
besides
,
a
heavy
hail
-
storm
have
fall
a
few
day
ago
.
<EOS>
Madame
question
me
very
closely
as
to
what
I
have
see
,
but
I
only
describe
an
obscure
figure
clothe
in
black
:
<EOS>
I
take
care
not
to
breathe
the
word
"
nun
,
"
certain
that
this
word
would
at
once
suggest
to
her
mind
an
idea
of
romance
and
unreality
.
<EOS>
She
charge
me
to
say
nothing
on
the
subject
to
any
servant
,
pupil
,
or
teacher
,
and
highly
commend
my
discretion
in
come
to
her
private
salle
-
à
-
manger
,
instead
of
carry
the
tale
of
horror
to
the
school
refectory
.
<EOS>
thus
the
subject
drop
.
<EOS>
I
be
leave
secretly
and
sadly
to
wonder
,
in
my
own
mind
,
whether
that
strange
thing
be
of
this
world
,
or
of
a
realm
beyond
the
grave
;
or
whether
indeed
it
be
only
the
child
of
malady
,
and
I
of
that
malady
the
prey
.
    
<EOS>
VASHTI
.
  
<EOS>
to
wonder
sadly
,
do
I
say
?
<EOS>
no
:
a
new
influence
begin
to
act
upon
my
life
,
and
sadness
,
for
a
certain
space
,
be
hold
at
bay
.
<EOS>
conceive
a
dell
,
deep
-
hollow
in
forest
secresy
;
it
lie
in
dimness
and
mist
:
<EOS>
its
turf
be
dank
,
its
herbage
pale
and
humid
.
<EOS>
a
storm
or
an
axe
make
a
wide
gap
amongst
the
oak
-
tree
;
the
breeze
sweep
in
;
the
sun
look
down
;
the
sad
,
cold
dell
become
a
deep
cup
of
lustre
;
high
summer
pour
her
blue
glory
and
her
golden
light
out
of
that
beauteous
sky
,
which
till
now
the
starve
hollow
never
see

<EOS>
a
new
creed
become
mine
 
a

in
happiness

<EOS>
It
be
three
week
since
the
adventure
of
the

,
and
I
possess
in
that
case

vital

it

they

time

dear

mellow
them
to
a
beverage
of
this
mild
quality
;
but
when
I
first
taste
their
elixir
,
fresh
from
the
fount
<EOS>
so
honour
,
it
seem
juice
of
a
divine
vintage
:
a
draught
which
Hebe

fill

and
the
very
god
approve
.
  
<EOS>
do
the
reader
,
remember
what
be
say
some
page
back
,
care
to
ask
how
I
answer
these
letter
:
whether
under
the
dry
,
stint
check
of
reason
,
or
accord
to
the
full
,
liberal
impulse
of
feel
?
  
<EOS>
to
speak
truth
,
I
compromise
matter
;
I
serve
two
master
:
<EOS>
I
bow
down
in
the
house
of
Rimmon
,
and
lift
the
heart
at
another
shrine
.
<EOS>
I
write
to
these
letter
two
answer
 
one
for
my
own
relief
,
the
other
for
Graham
's
perusal
.
  
<EOS>
to
begin
with
:
feeling
and
I
turn
Reason
out
of
door
,
draw
against
her
bar
and
bolt
,
then
we
sit
down
,
spread
our
paper
,
dip
in
the
ink
an
eager
pen
,
and
,
with
deep
enjoyment
,
pour
out
our
sincere
heart
.
<EOS>
when
we
have
do
 
when
two
sheet
be
cover
with
the
language
of
a
strongly
-
adherent
affection
,
a
rooted
and
active
gratitude
 
(
once
,
for
all
,
in
this
parenthesis
,
I
disclaim
,
with
the
utmost
scorn
,
every
sneak
suspicion
of
what

where
,
from
the
commencement

through
the
whole
progress
of
an

they
have
never
once
be
cheat
of
the
conviction
that
,
to
do
so
would
be
to
commit
a
mortal
absurdity
:
nobody
ever
launch
into
Love
unless
he
have
see
or
dream
the
rise
of
Hope
's
star
over
Love
's
troubled
water
)
 
<EOS>
when
,
then
,
I
have
give
expression
to
a
closely
-
cling
and
deeply
-
honour
attachment
 
an
attachment
that
want
to
attract
to
itself
and
take
to
its
own
lot
all
that
be
painful
in
the
destiny
of
its
object

that
would

if
it
could

have
absorb
and
conduct
away
all
storm

lightning
from
an
existence
view
with
a
passion
of
solicitude
 
then
,
just
at
that
moment
,
the
door
of
my
heart
would
shake
,
bolt
and
bar
would
yield
,
Reason
would
leap
in
vigorous

revengeful

snatch
the

<EOS>
She
do
right

<EOS>
I
do
not
live
on
letter
only
<EOS>
:
I
be
visit

I

look

once
a
week
I

out
to
La

;
always
I

<EOS>
Dr.
Bretton
fail
not
to
tell
me
_
why
_
<EOS>
he
be
so
kind
:
"
<EOS>
to
keep
away
the
nun
,
"
he
say
;
"
he
be
determined
to
dispute
with
her
her
prey
.
<EOS>
He
have
take
,
"
he
declare
,
"
a
thorough
dislike
to
her
,
chiefly
on
account
of
that
white
face
-
cloth
,
and
those
cold
grey
eye
:
<EOS>
the
moment
he
hear
of
those
odious
particular
,
"
he
affirm
,
"
consummate
disgust
have
incite
him
to
oppose
her
;
he
be
determined
to
try
whether
he
or
she
be
the
clever
,
and
he
only
wish
she
would
once
more
look
in
upon
me
when
he
be
present
:
"
but
_
that
_
she
never
do
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
regard
me
scientifically
in
the
light
of
a
patient
,
and
at
once
exercise
his
professional
skill
,
and
gratify
his
natural
benevolence
,
by
a
course
of
cordial
and
attentive
treatment
.
  
<EOS>
one
evening
,
the
first
in
December
,
I
be
walk
by
myself
in
the
carré
;
it
be
six
o'clock
;
the
classe
-
door
be
close
;
but
within
,
the
pupil
,
rampant
in
the
licence
of
evening
recreation
,
be
counterfeit
a
miniature
chaos
.
<EOS>
the
carré
be
quite
dark
,
except
a
red
light
shine
under
and
about
the
stove
;
the
wide
glass
-
door
and
the
long
window
be
frost
over
;
a
crystal
sparkle
of
starlight
,
here
and
there
spangle
this
blanch
winter
veil
,
and
break
with
scatter
brilliance
the
paleness
of
its
embroidery
,
prove
it
a
clear
night
,
though
moonless
.
<EOS>
that
I
should
dare
to
remain
thus
alone
in
darkness
,
show
that
my
nerve
be
regain
a
healthy
tone
<EOS>
:
I
think
of
the
nun
,
but
hardly
fear
her
;
though
the
staircase
be
behind
me
,
lead
up
,
through
blind
,
black
night
,
from
land
to
landing
,
to
the
haunted
grenier
.
<EOS>
yet
I
own
my
heart
quake
,
<EOS>
my
pulse
leap
,
when
I
suddenly
hear
breathing
and
rustle
,
and
turn
,
see
in
the
deep
shadow
of
the
step
a
deep
shadow
<EOS>
still
 
a
shape
that
move
and
descend
.
<EOS>
It
pause
a
while
at
the
classe
-
door
,
and
then
it
glide
before
me
.
<EOS>
simultaneously
come
a
clangor
of
the
distant
door
-
bell
.
<EOS>
life
-
like
sound
bring
life
-
like
feeling
:
this
shape
be
too
round
and
low
for
my
gaunt
nun
<EOS>
:
it
be
only
Madame
Beck
on
duty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
Lucy
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Rosine
,
burst
in
,
lamp
in

,
from
the
corridor
,
"

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Madame
see
me
,
I
see
Madame
,
Rosine
see
us
both
:
there
be
no
mutual
recognition
.
<EOS>
I
make
straight
for
the
salon
.
<EOS>
there
I
find
what
I
own
<EOS>
I
anticipate
I
should
find
 
Dr.
Bretton
;
but
he
be
in
evening
-
dress
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
carriage
be
at
the
door
,
"
say
he
;
"
my
mother
have
send
it
to
take
you
to
the
theatre
;
she
be
go
herself
,
but
an
arrival
have
prevent
her
:
she
immediately
say
,
"
take
Lucy
in
my
place
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
just
now
?
<EOS>
I
be
not
dress
,
"
cry
I
,
glance
despairingly
at
my
dark
merino
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
half
an
hour
to
dress
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
give
you
notice
,
but
I
only
determine
on
go
since
five
o'clock
,
when
I
hear
there
be
to
be
a
genuine
regale
in
the
presence
of
a
great
actress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
he
mention
a
name
that
thrill
me
 
a
name
that
,
in
those
day
,
could
thrill
Europe
.
<EOS>
It
be
hush
now
:
its
once
restless
echo
be
all
still
;
she
who
bear
it
go
year
ago
to
her
rest
:
night
and
oblivion
long
since
close
above
her
;
but
_
then
_
her
day
 
a
day
of
Sirius
 
stand
at
its
full
height
,
light
and
fervour
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
;
I
will
be
ready
in
ten
minute
,
"
I
vow
.
<EOS>
and
away
I
fly
,
never
once
check
,
reader
,
by
the
thought
which
perhaps
at
this
moment
check
you
:
namely
,
that
to
go
anywhere
with
Graham
and
without
Mrs.
Bretton
could
be
objectionable
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
conceive
,
much
less
have
express
to
Graham
,
<EOS>
such
thought
 
<EOS>
such
scruple
 
<EOS>
without
risk
of
excite
a
tyrannous
self
-
contempt
:
of
kindle
an
inward
fire
of
shame
so
quenchless
,
and
so
devour
,
that
I
think
it
would
soon
have
lick
up
the
very
life
in
my
vein
.
<EOS>
besides
,
my
godmother
,
know
her
son
,
and
know
me
,
would
as
soon
have
think
of
chaperone
a
sister
with
a
brother
,
as
of
keep
anxious
guard
over
our
incoming
and
outgoing
.
  
<EOS>
the
present
be
no
occasion
for
showy
array
;
my
dun
mist
crape
would
suffice
,
and
I
seek
the
same
in
the
great
oak
-
wardrobe
in
the
dormitory
,
where
hang
no
less
than
forty
dress
.
<EOS>
but
there
have
be
change
and
reform
,
and
some
innovate
hand
have
prune
this
same
crowded
wardrobe
,
and
carry
diver
garment
to
the
grenier
 
my
crape
amongst
the
rest
.
<EOS>
I
must
fetch
it
.
<EOS>
I
get
the
key
,
and
go
aloft
fearless
,
almost
thoughtless
.
<EOS>
I
unlock
the
door
,
I
plunge
in
.
<EOS>
the
reader
may
believe
it
or
not
,
but
when
I
thus
suddenly
enter
,
that
garret
be
not
wholly
dark
as
it
should
have
be
:
from
one
point
there
shine
a
solemn
light
,
like
a
star
,
but
broad
.
<EOS>
so
plainly
it
shine
,
that
it
reveal
the
deep
alcove
with
a
portion
of
the
tarnished
scarlet
curtain
draw
over
it
.
<EOS>
instantly
,
silently
,
before
my
eye
,
it
vanish
;
so
do
the
curtain
and
alcove
:
<EOS>
all
that
end
of
the
garret
become
black
as
night
.
<EOS>
I
venture
no
research
;
I
have
not
time
nor
will
;
snatch
my
dress
,
which
hang
on
the
wall
,
happily
near
the
door
,
I
rush
out
,
relocke
the
door
with
convulse
haste
,
and
dart
downward
to
the
dormitory
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
tremble
too
much
to
dress
myself
:
impossible
to
arrange
hair
or
fasten
hook
-
and
-
eye
with
such
finger
,
so
I
call
Rosine
and
bribe
her
to
help
me
.
<EOS>
Rosine
like
a
bribe
,
so
she
do
her
good
,
smooth
and
plait
my
hair
as
well
as
a
coiffeur
would
have
do
,
place
the
lace
collar
mathematically
straight
,
tie
the
neck
-
ribbon
accurately
 
in
short
,
do
her
work
like
the
neat
-
handed
Phillis
<EOS>
she
could
be
when
she
those
.
<EOS>
have
give
me
my
handkerchief
and
glove
,
she
take
the
candle
and
light
me
down
-
stair
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
I
have
forget
my
shawl
;
she
run
back
to
fetch
it
;
and
I
stand
with
Dr.
John
in
the
vestibule
,
wait
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
this
,
Lucy
?
"
say
he
,
look
down
at
me
narrowly
.
<EOS>
"
here
be
the
old
excitement
.
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
the
nun
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
I
utterly
deny
the
charge
:
I
be
vex
to
be
suspect
of
a
second
illusion
.
<EOS>
He
be
sceptical
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
be
,
as
sure
as
I
live
,
"
say
he
;
"
her
figure
cross
your
eye
leave
on
them
a
peculiar
gleam
and
expression
not
to
be
mistake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
_
not
_
be
,
"
<EOS>
I
persist
:
for
,
indeed
,
I
could
deny
her
apparition
with
truth
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
old
symptom
be
there
,
"
he
affirm
:
"
a
particular
pale
,
and
what
the
Scotch
call
a
"
raise
"
look
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
so
obstinate
<EOS>
,
I
think
it
better
to
tell
him
what
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
really
_
have
_
see
.
<EOS>
of
course
with
him
it
be
hold
to
be
another
effect
of
the
same
cause
:
it
be
all
optical
illusion
 
nervous
malady
,
and
so
on
.
<EOS>
not
one
bit
do
I
believe
him
;
but
I
dare
not
contradict
:
doctor
be
so
self
-
opinionate
,
so
immovable
in
their
dry
,
materialist
view
.
  
<EOS>
Rosine
bring
the
shawl
,
and
I
be
bundle
into
the
carriage
.
     
<EOS>
the
theatre
be
full
 
cram
to
its
roof
:
<EOS>
royal
and
noble
be
there

<EOS>
palace
and
hotel
have
empty
their
inmate
into
those
tier
so
thronged
and
so
hush
.
<EOS>
deeply
do
I
feel
myself
privileged
in
have
a
place
before
that
stage
;
I
long
to
see
a
being
of
whose
power
I
have
hear
report
which
make
me
conceive
peculiar
anticipation
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
she
would
justify
her
renown
:
with
strange
curiosity
,
with
feeling
severe
and
austere
,
yet
of
rivet
interest
,
I
wait
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
study
of
such
nature
as
have
not
encounter
my
eye
yet
:
a
great
and
new
planet
<EOS>
she
be
:
<EOS>
but
in
what
shape
?
<EOS>
I
wait
her
rise
.
  
<EOS>
She
rise
at
nine
that
December
night
:
above
the
horizon
I
see
her
come
.
<EOS>
She
could
shine
yet
with
pale
grandeur
and
steady
may
;
but
that
star
verge
already
on
its
judgment
-
day
.
<EOS>
see
near
,
it
be
a
chaos
 
<EOS>
hollow
,
half
-
consume
:
an
orb
perished
or
perishing
 
half
lava
,
half
glow
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
hear
this
woman
term
"
plain
,
"
and
I
expect
bony
harshness
and
grimness
 
something
large
,
angular
,
sallow
.
<EOS>
what
I
see
be
the
shadow
of
a
royal
Vashti
:
a
queen
,
fair
as
the
day
once
,
turn
pale
now
like
twilight
,
and
waste
like
wax
in
flame
.
  
<EOS>
for
awhile
 
a
long
while
 
I
think
it
be
only
a
woman
,
though
an
unique
woman
,
who
move
in
might
and
grace
before
this
multitude
.
<EOS>
by
-
and
-
by
I
recognise
my
mistake
.
<EOS>
behold
!
<EOS>
I
find
upon
her
something
neither
of
woman
nor
of
man
:
in
each
of
her
eye
sit
a
devil
.
<EOS>
these
evil
force
bear
her
through
the
tragedy
,
keep
up
her
feeble
strength
 
<EOS>
for
she
be
but
a
frail
creature
;
and
as
the
action
rise
and
the
stir
deepen
,
how
wildly
they
shake
her
with
their
passion
of
the
pit
!
<EOS>
They
write
HELL
on
her
straight
,
haughty
brow
.
<EOS>
They
tune
her
voice
to
the
note
of
torment
.
<EOS>
They
writhe
her
regal
face
to
a
demoniac
mask
.
<EOS>
Hate
and
Murder
and
Madness
incarnate
she
stand
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
marvellous
sight
:
a
mighty
revelation
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
spectacle
low
,
horrible
,
immoral
.
  
<EOS>
Swordsmen
thrust
through
,
and
die
in
their
blood
on
the
arena
sand
;
bull
gore
horse
disembowel
,
make
a
meeker
vision
for
the
public
 
a
milder
condiment
for
a
people
's
palate
 
than
Vashti
tear
by
seven
devil
:
devil
which
cry
sore
and
rent
the
tenement
they
haunt
,
but
still
refuse
to
be
exorcise
.
  
<EOS>
suffering
have
strike
that
stage
empress
;
and
she
stand
before
her
audience
neither
yield
to
,
nor
enduring
,
nor
,
in
finite
measure
,
resent
it
:
she
stand
lock
in
struggle
,
rigid
in
resistance
.
<EOS>
She
stand
,
not
dress
,
but
drape
in
pale
antique
fold
,
long
and
regular
like
sculpture
.
<EOS>
a
background
and
entourage
and
flooring
of
deep
crimson
throw
her
out
,
white
like
alabaster
 
like
silver
:
rather
,
be
it
say
,
like
death
.
  
<EOS>
where
be
the
artist
of
the
Cleopatra
?
<EOS>
let
him
come
and
sit
down
and
study
this
different
vision
.
<EOS>
let
him
seek
here
the
mighty
brawn
,
the
muscle
,
the
abound
blood
,
the
full
-
fed
flesh
he
worship
:
<EOS>
let
all
materialist
draw
nigh
and
look
on
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
say
that
she
do
not
_
resent
_
her
grief
.
<EOS>
no
;
the
weakness
of
that
word
would
make
it
a
lie
.
<EOS>
to
her
,
what
hurt
become
immediately
embody
:
she
look
on
it
as
a
thing
that
can
be
attack
,
worry
down
,
tear
in
shred
.
<EOS>
scarcely
a
substance
herself
,
she
grapple
to
conflict
with
abstraction
.
<EOS>
before
calamity
she
be
a
tigress
;
she
rend
her
woe
,
shiver
them
in
convulsed
abhorrence
.
<EOS>
pain
,
for
her
,
have
no
result
in
good
:
<EOS>
tear
water
<EOS>
no
harvest
of
wisdom
<EOS>
:
on
sickness
,
on
death
itself
,
she
look
with
the
eye
of
a
rebel
.
<EOS>
wicked
,
<EOS>
perhaps
,
she
be
,
but
also
she
be
strong
;
and
her
strength
have
conquer
Beauty
,
have
overcome
grace
,
and
bind
both
at
her
side
,
captive
peerlessly
fair

and
docile
as

<EOS>
even
in
the
uttermost
frenzy
of
energy
be
each
maenad
movement
royally
,
imperially
,
incedingly
upborne

<EOS>
Her

fly
loose
in

or

be
still
an
angel

hair
,
and
glorious
under
a

<EOS>
fall

<EOS>
Heaven

follow
her
exile

pierce
its

and
disclose
their
forlorn
remoteness
.
  
<EOS>
place
now
the
Cleopatra
,
or
any
other
slug
,
before
her
as
an
obstacle
,
and
see
her
cut
through
the
pulpy
mass
as
the
scimitar
of
Saladin
clove
the
down
cushion
.
<EOS>
let
Paul
Peter
Rubens
wake
from
the
dead
,
let
him
rise
out
of
his
cerement
,
and
bring
into
this
presence
all
the
army
of
his
fat
woman
;
the
magian
power
or
prophet
-
virtue
gift
that

release

<EOS>
Vashti
be
not
good
,
I
be
tell
;
and
I
have
say
she
do
not
look
good
:
though
a
spirit
,
she
be
a
spirit
out
of
Tophet
.
<EOS>
well
,
if
so
much
of
unholy
force
can
arise
from
below
,
may
not
an
equal
efflux
of
sacred
essence
descend
one
day
from
above
?
  
<EOS>
what
think
Dr.
Graham
of
this
being
?
  
<EOS>
for
long
interval
I
forgot
to
look
how
he
demean
himself
,
or
to
question
what
he
think
.
<EOS>
the
strong
magnetism
of
genius
draw
my
heart
out
of
its
wonted
orbit
;
the
sunflower
turn
from
the
south
to
a
fierce
light
,
not
solar
 
a
rushing

red
,
cometary
light
 
hot
on
vision
and
to
sensation
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
act
before
,
but
never
anything
like
this
:
never
anything
which
astonish
Hope
and
hush
desire
;
which
outstrip
Impulse
and
pale
conception
;
which
,
instead
of
merely
irritate
imagination
with
the
thought
of
what
_
may
_
be
do
,
at
the
same

fevere
the
nerve
because
it
be
_
not

do
,
disclose
power
like
a
deep

swollen
winter
river
,
thunder
in
cataract

and
bear
the
soul

like

<EOS>
Miss
Fanshawe
,
with
her
usual
ripeness
of
judgment
,
pronounce
Dr.
Bretton
a
serious
,
impassioned
man
,
too
grave
and
too
impressible
.
<EOS>
not
in
such
light
do
I
ever
see
him
:
<EOS>
no
such
fault
<EOS>
could
I
lay
to
his
charge
.
<EOS>
His
natural
attitude
be
not
the
meditative
,
nor
his
natural
mood
the
sentimental
;
_
impressionable
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
he
be
as
dimpling
water
,
but
,
almost
as
water
,
_
unimpressible
:
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
the
breeze
,
the
sun
,
move
him
 
metal
could
not
grave
,
nor
fire
brand

<EOS>
Dr.
John
_
could
_
think
and
think
well
,
but
he
be
rather
a
man
of
action
than
of
thought
;
he
_
could
_
feel
,
and
feel
vividly
in
his
way
,
but
his
heart
have
no
chord
for
enthusiasm
:
to
bright
,
soft
,
sweet
influence
<EOS>
his
eye
and
lip
give
bright
,
soft
,
sweet
welcome
,
beautiful
to
see
as
dye
of
rose
and
silver
,
pearl
and
purple
,
imbue
summer
cloud
;
<EOS>
for
what
belong
to
storm
,
what
be
wild
and
intense
,
dangerous
,
sudden
,
and
flaming
,
he
have
no
sympathy
,
and
hold
with
it
no
communion
.
<EOS>
when
I
take
time
and
regain
inclination
to
glance
at
him
,
it
amuse
and
enlighten
me
to
discover
that
he
be
watch
that
sinister
and
sovereign
Vashti
,
not
with
wonder
,
nor
worship
,
nor
yet
dismay
,
but
simply
with
intense
curiosity
.
<EOS>
Her
agony
do
not
pain
him
,
her
wild
moan
 
bad
than
a
shriek
 
<EOS>
do
not
much
move
him
;
her
fury
revolt
him
somewhat
,
but
not
to
the
point
of
horror
.
<EOS>
cool
young
Briton
!
<EOS>
the
pale
cliff
of
his
own
England
do
not
look
down
on
the
tide
of
the
Channel
more
calmly
than
he
watch
the
pythian
inspiration
of
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
look
at
his
face
,
I
long
to
know
his
exact
opinion
,
and
at
last
I
put
a
question
tend
to
elicit
them
.
<EOS>
at
the
sound
of
my
voice
he
awake
as
if
out
of
a
dream
;
for
he
have
be
think
,
and
very
intently
think
,
his
own
thought
,
after
his
own
manner
.
<EOS>
"
how
do
he
like
Vashti
?
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
know
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hm
-
m
-
m
,
"
be
the
first
scarce
articulate
but
expressive
answer
;
and
then
such
a
strange
smile
go
wander
round
his
lip
,
a
smile
so
critical
,
so
almost
callous
!
<EOS>
I
suppose
that
for
nature
of
that
order
his
sympathy
_
be
_
callous
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
terse
phrase
he
tell
me
his
opinion
of
,
and
feel
towards
,
the
actress
<EOS>
:
he
judge
her
as
a
woman
,
not
an
artist
:
it
be
a
branding
judgment
.
  
<EOS>
that
night
be
already
mark
in
my
book
of
life
,
not
with
white
,
but
with
a
deep

red
cross

<EOS>
but
I
have
not

it

and
other
memorandum

destine

set
down
in

of

indelible

<EOS>
towards
midnight
,
when
the
deepen
tragedy
blacken
to
the
death

scene
,
and
all
hold
their
breath

and
even
Graham
bite

<EOS>
nothing

I

<EOS>
yes

thus

I

indeed

to

at

I

<EOS>
We

"
how

order
may

<EOS>
this

fifty
selfish

if
I

I

conscientiously
knock

"
You

he

turn
shortly
on
Dr.
Bretton
,
when
we

into

<EOS>
"
an

"
Papa

the

:
"

<EOS>
Lucy

lend
a
hand
one
instant

"
  
<EOS>
and
I
assist
while
he
make
some
arrangement
of
drapery
and
position
for
the
ease
of
his
suffering
burden
.
<EOS>
She
suppress
a
moan
,
and
lie
in
his
arm
quietly
and
patiently
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
very
light
,
"
say
Graham
,
"
like
a
child

"
<EOS>
and
he
ask
in
my
ear
,
"
be
she
a
child
,
Lucy

<EOS>
do
you
notice
her
age

"
  
<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
I
be
a
person
of
seventeen

respond
the
patient
,
demurely
and
with
dignity
.
<EOS>
then
,
directly
after
:
"
tell
papa
to
come
;
I
get
anxious
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
carriage
drive
up
;
her
father
relieve
Graham
;
but
in
the
exchange
from
one
bearer
to
another
she
be
hurt
,
and
moan
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
darling

"
say
the
father
,
tenderly
;
then
turn
to
Graham
,
"
You
say
,
sir

you

a
medical
man

<EOS>

I

Will

<EOS>
"
My

pleased

then

to

"
<EOS>
and
he
name
his
address
:
"
the
Hôtel
Crécy
,
in
the
Rue
Crécy

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
follow
;
the
carriage
drive
fast
;
myself
and
Graham
be
silent
.
<EOS>
this
seem
like
an
adventure
.
  
<EOS>
some
little
time
be
lose
in
seek
our
own
equipage
,
we
reach
the
hotel
perhaps
about
ten
minute
after
these
stranger
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
hotel
in
the
foreign
sense
:
<EOS>
a
collection
of
dwelling
-
house
,
not
an
inn
 
a
vast
,
lofty
pile
,
with
a
huge
arch
to
its
street
-
door
,
lead
through
a
vaulted
cover
way
,
into
a
square
<EOS>
all
build
round
.
  
<EOS>
We
alight
,
pass
up
a
wide
,
handsome
public
staircase
,
and
stop
at
Numéro
2
on
the
second
landing
;
the
first
floor
comprise
the
abode
of
<EOS>
I
know
not
<EOS>
what
"
prince
Russe
,
"
as
Graham
inform
me
.
<EOS>
on
ring
the
bell
at
a
second
great
door
,
we
be
admit
to
a
suite
of
very
handsome
apartment
.
<EOS>
announce
by
a
servant
in
livery
,
we
enter
a
drawing
-
room
whose
hearth
glow
with
an
english
fire
,
and
whose
wall
gleam
with
foreign
mirror
.
<EOS>
near
the
hearth
appear
a
little
group
:
a
slight
form
sink
in
a
deep
arm
-
chair
,
one
or
two
woman
busy
about
it
,
the
iron
-
grey
gentleman
anxiously
look
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
Harriet
?
<EOS>
I
wish
Harriet
would
come
to
me
,
"
say
the
girlish
voice
,
faintly
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
Mrs.
Hurst
?
"
demand
the
gentleman
impatiently
and
somewhat
sternly
of
the
man
-
servant
who
have
admit
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
to
say
she
be
go
out
of
town
,
sir
;
my
young
lady
give
her
leave
till
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
 
I
do
 
<EOS>
I
do
.
<EOS>
She
be
go
to
see
her
sister
;
I
say
she
may
go
:
<EOS>
I
remember
now
,
"
interpose
the
young
lady
;
"
but
I
be
so
sorry
,
for
Manon
and
Louison
can
not
understand
a
word
I
say
,
and
they
hurt
me
without
mean
to
do
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
John
and
the
gentleman
now
interchange
greeting
;
and
while
they
pass
a
few
minute
in
consultation
,
I
approach
the
easy
-
chair
,
and
see
what
the
faint
and
sinking
girl
wish
to
have
do
,
I
do
it
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
still
occupy
in
the
arrangement
<EOS>
,
when
Graham
draw
near
;
he
be
no
less
skilled
in
surgery
than
medicine
,
and
,
on
examination
,
find
that
no
further
advice
than
his
own
be
necessary
to
the
treatment
of
the
present
case
.
<EOS>
He
order
her
to
be
carry
to
her
chamber
,
and
whisper
to
me
:
 
<EOS>
"
go
with
the
woman
,
Lucy
;
they
seem
but
dull
;
you
can
at
least
direct
their
movement
,
and
thus
spare
her
some
pain
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
touch
very
tenderly
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
chamber
be
a
room
shadowy
with
pale
-
blue
hanging
,
vaporous
with
curtaining
and
veiling
of
muslin
;
the
bed
seem
to
me
like
snow
-
drift
and
mist
 
spotless
,
soft
,
and
gauzy
.
<EOS>
make
the
woman
stand
apart
,
I
undress
their
mistress
,
without
their
well
-
mean
but
clumsy
aid
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
in
a
sufficiently
collect
mood
to
note
with
separate
distinctness
every
detail
of
the
attire
I
remove
,
but
I
receive
a
general
impression
of
refinement
,
delicacy
,
and
perfect
personal
cultivation
;
which
,
in
a
period
of
after
-
think
,
offer
in
my
reflection
a
singular
contrast
to
note
retain
of
Miss
Ginevra
Fanshawe
's
appointment
.
  
<EOS>
the
girl
be
herself
a
small
,
delicate
creature
,
but
make
like
a
model
.
<EOS>
as
I
fold
back
her
plentiful
yet
fine
hair
,
so
shining
and
soft
,
and
so
exquisitely
tended
,
I
have
under
my
observation
a
young
,
pale
,
weary
,
but
high
-
breed
face
.
<EOS>
the
brow
be
smooth
and
clear
;
the
eyebrow
be
distinct
,
but
soft
,
and
melt
to
a
mere
trace
at
the
temple
;
the
eye
be
a
rich
gift
of
nature
 
fine
and
full
,
large
,
deep
,
seem
to
hold
dominion
over
the
slighter
subordinate
feature
 
capable
,
probably
,
of
much
significance
at
another
hour
and
under
other
circumstance
than
the
present
,
but
now
languid
and
suffer
.
<EOS>
Her
skin
be
perfectly
fair
,
the
neck
and
hand
vein
finely
like
the
petal
of
a
flower
;
a
thin
glazing
of
the
ice
of
pride
polish
this
delicate
exterior
,
and
her
lip
wear
a
curl
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
inherent
and
unconscious
,
but
which
,
if
I
have
see
it
first
with
the
accompaniment
of
health
and
state
,
would
have
strike
me
as
unwarranted
,
and
prove
in
the
little
lady
a
quite
mistaken
view
of
life
and
her
own
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
Her
demeanour
under
the
Doctor
's
hand
at
first
excite
a
smile
;
it
be
not
puerile
 
rather
,
on
the
whole
,
patient
and
firm
 
but
yet
,
once
or
twice
<EOS>
she
address
him
with
suddenness
and
sharpness
,
say
that
he
hurt
her
,
and
must
contrive
to
give
her
less
pain
;
I
see
her
large
eye
,
too
,
settle
on
his
face
like
the
solemn
eye
of
some
pretty
,
wonder
child
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
Graham
feel
this
examination
:
if
he
do
,
he
be
cautious
not
to
check
or
discomfort
it
by
any
retaliatory
look
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
perform
his
work
with
extreme
care
and
gentleness
,
spare
her
what
pain
he
could
;
and
she
acknowledge
as
much
,
when
he
have
do
,
by
the
word
:
 
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
Doctor
,
and
good
-
night
,
"
very
gratefully
pronounce
as
she
utter
them
,
however
,
it
be
with
a
repetition
of
the
serious
,
direct
gaze
,
I
think
,
peculiar
in
its
gravity
and
intentness
.
  
<EOS>
the
injury
,
it
seem
,
be
not
dangerous
:
an
assurance
which
her
father
receive
with
a
smile
that
almost
make
one
<EOS>
his
friend
 
<EOS>
it
be
so
glad
and
gratified
.
<EOS>
He
now
express
his
obligation
to
Graham
with
as
much
earnestness
as
be
befit
an
Englishman
address
one
who
have
serve
him
,
but
be
yet
a
stranger
;
he
also
beg
him
to
call
the
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
"
say
a
voice
from
the
veil
couch
,
"
thank
the
lady
,
too
;
be
she
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
open
the
curtain
with
a
smile
,
and
look
in
at
her
.
<EOS>
She
lie
now
at
comparative
ease
;
she
look
pretty
,
though
pale
;
her
face
be
delicately
design
,
and
<EOS>
if
at
first
sight
it
appear
proud
,
I
believe
custom
may
prove
it
to
be
soft
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
the
lady
very
sincerely
,
"
say
her
father
:
"
I
fancy
she
have
be
very
good
to
my
child
.
<EOS>
I
think
we
scarcely
dare
tell
Mrs.
Hurst
who
have
be
her
substitute
and
do
her
work
;
she
will
feel
at
once
ashamed
and
jealous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
thus
,
in
the
most
friendly
spirit
,
parting
greeting
be
interchange
;
and
refreshment
have
be
hospitably
offer
,
but
by
us
,
as
it
be
late
,
refuse
,
we
withdraw
from
the
Hôtel
Crécy
.
  
<EOS>
on
our
way
back
we
repasse
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
all
be
silence
and
darkness
:
the
roaring
,
rush
crowd
all
vanish
and
go
 
the
damp
,
as
well
as
the
incipient
fire
,
extinct
and
forgotten
.
<EOS>
next
morning
's
paper
explain
that
it
be
but
some
loose
drapery
on
which
a
spark
have
fall
,
and
which
have
blaze
up
and
be
quench
in
a
moment

<EOS>
those
who
live
in
retirement
,
whose
life
have
fall
amid
the
seclusion
of
school
or
of
other
wall
-
in
and
guard
dwelling
,
be
liable
to
be
suddenly
and
for
a
long
while
drop
out
of
the
memory
of
their
friend
,
the
denizen
of
a
free
world
.
<EOS>
unaccountably
,
perhaps
,
and
close
upon
some
space
of
unusually
frequent
intercourse
 
<EOS>
some
congerie
of
rather
exciting
little
circumstance
,
whose
natural
sequel
would
rather
seem
to
be
the
quickening
than
the
suspension
of
communication
 
there
fall
a
stilly
pause
,
a
wordless
silence
,
a
long
blank
of
oblivion
.
<EOS>
unbroken
always
be
this
blank
;
alike
entire
and
unexplained
.
<EOS>
the
letter
,
the
message
once
frequent
,
be
cut
off
;
the
visit
,
formerly
periodical
,
cease
to
occur
;
the
book
,
paper
,
or
other
token
that
indicate
remembrance
,
come
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
always
there
be
excellent
reason
for
these
lapse
,
if
the
hermit
but
know
them
.
<EOS>
though
he
be
stagnant
in
his
cell
,
his
connection
without
be
whirl
in
the
very
vortex
of
life
.
<EOS>
that
void
interval
which
pass
for
him
so
slowly
that
the
very
clock
seem
at
a
stand
,
and
the
wingless
hour
plod
by
in
the
likeness
of
tired
tramp
prone
to
rest
at
milestone
 
<EOS>
that
same
interval
,
perhaps
,
teem
with
event
,
and
pant
with
hurry
for
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
the
hermit
 
if
he
be
a
sensible
hermit
 
will
swallow
his
own
thought
,
and
lock
up
his
own
emotion
during
these
week
of
inward
winter
.
<EOS>
He
will
know
that
Destiny
design
him
to
imitate
,
on
occasion
,
the
dormouse
,
and
he
will
be
conformable
:
make
a
tidy
ball
of
himself
,
creep
into
a
hole
of
life
's
wall
,
and
submit
decently
to
the
drift
which
blow
in
and
soon
block
him
up
,
preserve
him
in
ice
for
the
season
.
  
<EOS>
let
him
say
,
"
It
be
quite
right
:
it
ought
to
be
so
,
since
so
it
be
.
"
<EOS>
and
,
perhaps
,
one
day
his
snow
-
sepulchre
will
open
,
spring
's
softness
will
return
,
the
sun
and
south
-
wind
will
reach
him
;
the
budding
of
hedge
,
and
carolling
of
bird
,
and
singing
of
liberated
stream
,
will
call
him
to
kindly
resurrection
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
perhaps
_
this
may
be
the
case
,
perhaps
not
:
the
frost
may
get
into
his
heart
and
never
thaw
more
;
when
spring
come
,
a
crow
or
a
pie
may
pick
out
of
the
wall
only
his
dormouse
-
bone
.
<EOS>
well
,
even
in
that
case
,
all
will
be
right
:
it
be
to
be
suppose
he
know
from
the
first
he
be
mortal
,
and
must
one
day
go
the
way
of
all
flesh
,
"
as
well
soon
as
syne
.
"
  
<EOS>
follow
that
eventful
evening
at
the
theatre
,
come
for
me
seven
week
as
bare
as
seven
sheet
of
blank
paper
:
no
word
be
write
on
one
of
them
;
not
a
visit
,
not
a
token
.
  
<EOS>
about
the
middle
of
that
time
I
entertain
fancy
that
something
have
happen
to
my
friend
at
La
Terrasse
.
<EOS>
the
mid
-
blank
be
always
a
beclouded
point
for
the
solitary
:
his
nerve
ache
with
the
strain
of
long
expectancy
;
the
doubt
hitherto
repel
gather
now
to
a
mass
and
 
strong
in
accumulation
 
roll
back
upon
him
with
a
force
which
savour
of
vindictiveness
.
<EOS>
night
,
too
,
become
an
unkindly
time
,
and
sleep
and
his
nature
can
not
agree
:
strange
start
and
struggle
harass
his
couch
:
the
sinister
band
of
bad
dream
,
with
horror
of
calamity
,
and
sick
dread
of
entire
desertion
at
their
head
,
join
the
league
against
him
.
<EOS>
poor
wretch
!
<EOS>
He
do
his
good
to
bear
up
,
but
he
be
a
poor
,
pallid
,
waste
wretch
,
despite
that
best
.
  
<EOS>
towards
the
last
of
these
long
seven
week
I
admit
,
what
through
the
other
six
I
have
jealously
exclude
 
the
conviction
that
these
blank
be
inevitable
:
the
result
of
circumstance
,
the
fiat
of
fate
,
a
part
of
my
life
's
lot
and
 
above
all
 
a
matter
about
whose
origin
no
question
must
ever
be
ask
,
for
whose
painful
sequence
no
murmur
ever
utter
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
do
not
blame
myself
for
suffering
:
<EOS>
I
thank
God
I
have
a
truer
sense
of
justice
than
to
fall
into
any
imbecile
extravagance
of
self
-
accusation
;
and
as
to
blame
other
for
silence
,
in
my
reason
I
well
know
them
blameless
,
and
in
my
heart
acknowledge
them
so
:
but
it
be
a
rough
and
heavy
road
to
travel
,
and
I
long
for
well
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
try
different
expedient
to
sustain
and
fill
existence
:
I
commence
an
elaborate
piece
of
lace
-
work
,
I
study
german
pretty
hard
,
<EOS>
I
undertake
a
course
of
regular
reading
of
the
dry
and
thick
book
in
the
library
;
in
all
my
effort
I
be
as
orthodox
as
I
know
how
to
be
.
<EOS>
be
there
error
somewhere
?
<EOS>
very
likely
.
<EOS>
I
only
know
the
result
be
as
if
I
have
gnaw
a
file
to
satisfy
hunger
,
or
drink
brine
to
quench
thirst
.
  
<EOS>
My
hour
of
torment
be
the
post
-
hour
.
<EOS>
unfortunately
,
I
know
it
too
well
,
and
try
as
vainly
as
assiduously
to
cheat
myself
of
that
knowledge
;
dread
the
rack
of
expectation
,
and
the
sick
collapse
of
disappointment
which
daily
precede
and
follow
upon
that
well
-
recognise
ring
.
  
<EOS>
I
suppose
animal
keep
in
cage
,
and
so
scantily
feed
as
to
be
always
upon
the
verge
of
famine
,
await
their
food
as
I
await
a
letter
.
<EOS>
oh
!
 
to
speak
truth
,
and
drop
that
tone
of
a
false
calm
which
long
to
sustain
,
outwear
nature
's
endurance
 
<EOS>
I
undergo
in
those
seven
week
bitter
fear
and
pain
,
strange
inward
trial
,
miserable
defection
of
hope
,
intolerable
encroachment
of
despair
.
<EOS>
this
last
come
so
near
me
sometimes
that
her
breath
go
right
through
me
.
<EOS>
I
use
to
feel
it
like
a
baleful
air
or
sigh
,
penetrate
deep
,
and
make
motion
pause
at
my
heart
,
or
proceed
only
under
unspeakable
oppression
.
<EOS>
the
letter
 
the
well
-
beloved
letter
 
would
not
come
;
and
it
be
all
of
sweetness
in
life
I
have
to
look
for
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
very
extremity
of
want
,
I
have
recourse
again
,
and
yet
again
,
to
the
little
packet
in
the
case
 
the
five
letter
.
<EOS>
how
splendid
that
month
seem
whose
sky
have
behold
the
rising
of
these
five
star
!
<EOS>
It
be
always
at
night
I
visit
them
,
and
not
daring
to
ask
every
evening
for
a
candle
in
the
kitchen
<EOS>
,
I
buy
a
wax
taper
and
match
to
light
it
,
and
at
the
study
-
hour
stole
up
to
the
dormitory
and
feast
on
my
crust
from
the
Barmecide
's
loaf
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
nourish
me
:
I
pine
on
it
,
and
get
as
thin
as
a
shadow
:
otherwise
I
be
not
ill
.
  
<EOS>
read
there
somewhat
late
one
evening
,
and
feel
that
the
power
to
read
be
leave
me
 
for
the
letter
from
incessant
perusal
be
lose
all
sap
and
significance
:
my
gold
be
wither
to
leave
before
my
eye
,
and
I
be
sorrow
over
the
disillusion
 
<EOS>
suddenly
a
quick
tripping
foot
run
up
the
stair
.
<EOS>
I
know
Ginevra
Fanshawe

step
:
she
have
dine
in

that
afternoon
;
she
be

would
come
here
to
replace
her
shawl

<EOS>
yes

dress
in
bright

with

shawl
fall
from

and
her
curl

half

uncurled
in
the
damp
of
night
,
droop
careless
and
heavy
upon
her
neck

<EOS>
I
have
hardly
time

recasket
my

lock
them
up
when

hour

be
near

and
I

wait
it
,
much
as

ghost

seer
may
wait

<EOS>
Less
than
ever
be
a
letter
probable
;
still
,
strive
as
I
would
,
I
could
not
forget
that
it
be
possible

<EOS>
as
the
moment
lessen
,
a
restlessness
and
fear
almost
beyond

average
assail
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
day
of
winter
east
wind
,
and
I
have
now
for
some
time
enter
into
that
dreary
fellowship
with
the
wind
and
their
change
,
so
little
known
,
so
incomprehensible
to
the
healthy
.
<EOS>
the
north
and
east
own
a
terrific
influence
,
make
all
pain
more
poignant
,
all
sorrow
sadder
.
<EOS>
the
south
could
calm
,
the
west
sometimes
cheer
:
unless
,
indeed
,
they
bring
on
their
wing
the
burden
of
thunder
-
cloud
,
under
the
weight
and
warmth
of
which
all
energy
die
.
  
<EOS>
bitter
and
dark
as
be
this
January
day
<EOS>
,
I
remember
leave
the
classe
,
and
run
down
without
bonnet
to
the
bottom
of
the
long
garden
,
and
then
linger
amongst
the
strip
shrub
,
in
the
forlorn
hope
that
the
postman
's
ring
may
occur
while
I
be
out
of
hearing
,
and
I
may
thus
be
spare
the
thrill
which
some
particular
nerve
or
nerve
,
almost
gnaw
through
with
the
unremitting
tooth
of
a
fix
idea
,
be
become
wholly
unfit
to
support
.
<EOS>
I
linger
as
long
as
I
dare
without
fear
of
attract
attention
by
my
absence
.
<EOS>
I
muffle
my
head
in
my
apron
,
and
stop
my
ear
in
terror
of
the
torturing
clang
,
sure
to
be
follow
by
such
blank
silence
,
such
barren
vacuum
for
me
.
<EOS>
at
last
I
venture
to
re
-
enter
the
first
classe
,
where
,
as
it
be
not
yet
nine
o'clock
,
no
pupil
have
be
admit
.
<EOS>
the
first
thing
see
be
a
white
object
on
my
black
desk
,
a
white
,
flat
object
.
<EOS>
the
post
have
,
indeed
,
arrive
;
by
me
unheard
.
<EOS>
Rosine
have
visit
my
cell
,
and
,
like
some
angel
,
have
leave
behind
her
a
bright
token
of
her
presence
.
<EOS>
that
shine
thing
on
the
desk
be
indeed
a
letter
,
a
real
letter
;
I
see
so
much
at
the
distance
of
three
yard
,
and
as
I
have
but
one
correspondent
on
earth
,
from
that
one
it
must
come
.
<EOS>
He
remember
me
yet
.
<EOS>
how
deep
a
pulse
of
gratitude
send
new
life
through
my
heart
.
  
<EOS>
draw
near
,
bend
and
look
on
the
letter
,
in
tremble
but
almost
certain
hope
of
see
a
know
hand
,
it
be
my
lot
to
find
,
on
the
contrary
,
an
autograph
for
the
moment
deem
unknown
 
a
pale
female
scrawl
,
instead
of
a
firm
,
masculine
character
.
<EOS>
I
then
think
fate
be
_
too
<EOS>
_
hard
for
me
,
<EOS>
and
I
say
,
audibly
,
"
this
be
cruel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
I
get
over
that
pain
also
.
<EOS>
life
be
still
life
,
whatever
its
pang
:
<EOS>
our
eye
and
ear
and
their
use
remain
with
us
,
though
the
prospect
of
what
please
be
wholly
withdraw
,
and
the
sound
of
what
console
be
quite
silence
.
  
<EOS>
I
open
the
billet
:
by
this
time
I
have
recognise
its
handwriting
as
perfectly
familiar
.
<EOS>
It
be
date
"
La
Terrasse
,
"
and
it
run
thus
:
    
"

busy

happy

ourselves
at
La
Terrasse

<EOS>
as
to
Graham
,
his
professional
connection
extend
daily
:
he
be
so
much
seek
after
,
so
much
engaged
,
that
I
tell
him
he
will
grow
quite
conceited
.
<EOS>
like
a
right
good
mother
,
as
I
be
,
I
do
my
good
to
keep
him
down
:
<EOS>
no
flattery
<EOS>
do
he
get
from
me
,
as
you
know
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
Lucy

he
be
a
fine
fellow
:
<EOS>
his
mother
's
heart
dance
at
the
sight
of
him

<EOS>
after
be
hurry
here
and
there
the
whole
day
,
and
pass
the
ordeal
of
fifty
sort
of
temper
,
and
combat
a
hundred
caprice
,
and
sometimes
witness
cruel
suffering
 
perhaps
,
occasionally
,
as
I
tell
him
,
inflict
them
 
at
night
he
still
come
home
to
me
in
such
kindly
,
pleasant
mood
,
that
really
,
I
seem
to
live
in
a
sort
of
moral
antipode
,
and
on
these
January
evening
my
day
rise
when
other
people
's
night
set
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
still
he
need
keep
in
order
,
and
correct
,
and
repress
,
and
I
do
him
that
good
service
;
but
the
boy
be
so
elastic
there
be
no
such
thing
as
vex
him
thoroughly
.
<EOS>
when
I
think
I
have
at
last
drive
him
to
the
sullen
,
he
turn
on
me
with
joke
for
retaliation
:
but
you
know
him
and
all
his
iniquity
,
and
I
be
but
an
elderly
simpleton
to
make
him
the
subject
of
this
epistle
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
for
me
,
I
have
have
my
old
Bretton
agent
here
on
a
visit
,
and
have
be
plunge
overhead
and
ear
in
business
matter
.
<EOS>
I
do
so
wish
to
regain
for
Graham
at
least
some
part
of
what
his
father
leave
him
.
<EOS>
He
laugh
to
scorn
my
anxiety
on
this
point
,
bid
me
look
and
see
how
he
can
provide
for
himself
and
me
too
,
and
ask
what
the
old
lady
can
possibly
want
that
she
have
not
;
hint
about
sky
-
blue
turbans
;
accuse
me
of
an
ambition
to
wear
diamond
,
keep
livery
servant
,
have
an
hotel
,
and
lead
the
fashion
amongst
the
english
clan
in
Villette

"
talk
of
sky
-
blue
turbans
,
I
wish
you
have
be
with
us
the
other
evening
.
<EOS>
He
have
come
in
really
tired
,
and
after
I
have
give
him
his
tea
,
he
throw
himself
into
my
chair
with
his
customary
presumption
.
<EOS>
to
my
great
delight
,
he
drop
asleep
.
<EOS>
(
You
know
how
he
tease
me
about
be
drowsy
;
<EOS>
I
,
who
never
,
by
any
chance
,
close
an
eye
by
daylight

<EOS>
while
he
sleep
,
I
think
he
look
very
bonny
,
Lucy
:
<EOS>
fool
as
I
be
to
be
so
proud
of
him
;
but
who
can
help
it
?
<EOS>
show
me
his
peer
.
<EOS>
look
where
I
will
,
I
see
nothing
like
him
in
Villette
.
<EOS>
well
,
I
take
it
into
my
head
to
play
him
a
trick
:
so
I
bring
out
the
sky
-
blue
turban
,
and
handle
it
with
gingerly
precaution
,
I
manage
to
invest
his
brow
with
this
grand
adornment
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
it
do
not
at
all
misbecome
him
;
he
look
quite
Eastern
,
except
that
he
be
so
fair
.
<EOS>
nobody
,
however
,
can
accuse
him
of
have
red
hair

<EOS>
now

<EOS>
it
be
genuine
chestnut
 
a
dark
,
glossy
chestnut

and
when
I
put
my
large
cashmere
about
him

there
be
as
fine

to
come
to
the
gist

my
letter

<EOS>
I
know
Thursday

a
half

holiday
in

Rue
Fossette
:
be
ready

by
five
in

afternoon

hour
I

send

<EOS>
now
,
a
letter
like
that
set
one
to
right
!
<EOS>
I
may
still
be
sad
after
read
that
letter
,
but
I
be
more
composed
<EOS>
;
not
exactly
cheer
,
perhaps
,
but
relieved
.
<EOS>
My
friend
,
at
least
,
be
well
and
happy
<EOS>
:
no
accident
have
occur
to
Graham
;
no
illness
have
seize
his
mother
-
calamity
that
have
so
long
be
my
dream
and
think
.
<EOS>
Their
feeling
for
me
too
be
 
as
they
have
be
.
<EOS>
yet
,
how
strange
it
be
to
look
on
Mrs.
Bretton
's
seven
week
and
contrast
them
with
my
seven
week
!
<EOS>
also
,
how
very
wise
it
be
in
people
place
in
an
exceptional
position
to
hold
their
tongue
and
not
rashly
declare
how
such
position
gall
them
!
<EOS>
the
world
can
understand
well
enough
the
process
of
perish
for
want
of
food
:
perhaps
few
person
can
enter
into
or
follow
out
that
of
go
mad
from
solitary
confinement
.
<EOS>
They
see
the
long
-
bury
prisoner
disinter
,
a
maniac
or
an
idiot
!
 
<EOS>
how
his
sense
leave
him
 
how
his
nerve
,
first
inflamed
,
undergo
nameless
agony
,
and
then
sink
to
palsy
 
be
a
subject
too
intricate
for
examination
,
too
abstract
for
popular
comprehension
.
<EOS>
speak
of
it
!
<EOS>
you
may
almost
as
well
stand
up
in
an
european
market
-
place
,
and
propound
dark
saying
in
that
language
and
mood
wherein
Nebuchadnezzar
,
the
imperial
hypochondriac
,
commune
with
his
baffle
Chaldeans
.
<EOS>
and
long
,
long
may
the
mind
to
whom
such
theme
be
no
mystery
 
by
whom
their
bearing
be
sympathetically
seize
 
be
few
in
number
,
and
rare
of
rencounter
.
<EOS>
long
may
it
be
generally
think
that
physical
privation
alone
merit
compassion
,
and
that
the
rest
be
a
figment
.
<EOS>
when
the
world
be
young
and
haler
than
now
,
moral
trial
be
a
deep
mystery
still
:
perhaps
in
all
the

of
Israel
there
be
but
one
Saul
 
certainly
but
one
David
to
soothe

comprehend
him

,
still
cold
of
the
morning
be
succeed
,
later
in
the
day
,
by
a
sharp
breathing
from
russian
waste
:
the
cold

sigh
over

temperate
zone
,

freeze
it
fast

a
heavy

dull

with

up
from

settle
over

Europe

<EOS>
towards
afternoon
begin
the
descent
.
<EOS>
I
fear
no
carriage
would
come
,
the
white
tempest

so
dense
and
wild

but
trust
my
godmother
!
<EOS>
once
have
ask
,
she
would
have
her
guest
.
<EOS>
about
six
o'clock
I
be
lift
from
the
carriage
over
the
already
block
-
up
front
step
of
the
château
,
and
put
in
at
the
door
of
La

<EOS>
run
through
the
vestibule
,
and
up

stair
to
the
drawing

room
,
there
I
find
Mrs.
Bretton
 
<EOS>
a
summer
-
day
in
her
own
person
.
<EOS>
have
I
be
twice
as
cold
as
I
be
,
her
kind
kiss
and
cordial
clasp
would
have
warm
me
.
<EOS>
inure
now
for
so
long
a
time
to
room
with
bare
board
,
black
bench
,
desk
,
and
stove
,
the
blue
saloon
seem
to
me
gorgeous
.
<EOS>
in
its
Christmas
-
like
fire
alone
there
be
a
clear
and
crimson
splendour
which
quite
dazzle
me
.
  
<EOS>
when
my
godmother
have
hold
my
hand
for
a
little
while
,
and
chat
with
me
,
and
scold
me
for
have
become
thin

when
she
last
see
me
,
she
profess
to
discover
that
the
snow

wind
have
disorder
my
hair
,
and
send
me
up

stair
to
make
it
neat
and
remove
my
shawl
.
  
<EOS>
repair
to
my
own
little
sea
-
green
room
,
there
also
I
find
a
bright
fire
,
and
candle
too
be
light
:
a
tall
waxlight
stand
on
each
side
the
great
looking
glass
;
but
between
the
candle
,
and
before
the
glass
,
appear
something
dress
itself
 
an
airy
,
fairy
thing
 
small
,
slight
,
white
 
a
winter
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
I
declare
,
for
one
moment
I
think
of
Graham
and
his
spectral
illusion
.
<EOS>
with
distrustful
eye
I
note
the
detail
of
this
new
vision
.
<EOS>
It
wear
white
,
sprinkle
slightly
with
drop
of
scarlet
;
its
girdle
be
red
;
it
have
something
in
its
hair
leafy
,
yet
shine
 
a
little
wreath
with
an
evergreen
gloss
.
<EOS>
spectral
or
not
,
here
truly
be
nothing
frightful
,
and
I
advance
.
  
<EOS>
turn
quick
upon
me
,
a
large
eye
,
under
long
lash
,
flash
over
me
,
the
intruder
:
the
lash
be
as
dark
as
long
,
and
they
soften
with
their
pencil
the
orb
they
guard
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
you
be
come
!

<EOS>
she
breathe
out
,
in
a
soft
,
quiet
voice
,
and
she
smile
slowly
,
and
gaze
intently
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
her
now
.
<EOS>
have
only
once
see
that
sort
of
face
,
with
that
cast
of
fine
and
delicate
featuring

I
could
not
but
know
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss

the
reply

I
have
move
to
the
fire
,
and
she
stand
opposite
,
and
gaze
into
me
;
and
as
she
gaze
,
her
face
become
gradually
more
and
more
expressive
of
thought
and
feeling
,
till
at
last
a
dimness
quench
her
clear
vision

<EOS>

It
make
me
almost
cry
to
look
so
far
back

say
she
:
"
<EOS>
but
as
to
be
sorry
,
or
sentimental

do
not
think
it

on
the
contrary

I

quite
pleased

glad

<EOS>
Interested
,
yet
altogether
at
fault

I
know
not
what
to

<EOS>
at
last
I
stammer

I

pale
,
small

her
fairy
symmetry

her
varying
expression

a
certain

grace

Paulina

be
become
beautiful
 
not
with
the
beauty

strike
the
eye

ruddy
,
and
replete
;
not
with
the
plump
,
and
pink
,
and
flaxen
attribute
of
her
blond
cousin
Ginevra

her
seventeen
year
have
bring
her
a
refined

tender
charm
which
do
not
lie
in

be

subdue
glow

outward

flame
vital

in
speak
of
her
attraction

I
would
not
exaggerate
language
;
but
,
indeed
,
they
seem
to
me
very
real

engaging

what
though
all
be
on

it
be
the
perfume

give
this

the

<EOS>
all

<EOS>
the
picture
which
now
crowd
upon
me
be
vivid
and
visible
to
her
.
<EOS>
Her
fond
attachment
,
her
sport
and
contest
with
a
well
-
love
playmate
,
the
patient
,
true
devotion
of
her
child
's
heart
,
her
fear
,
her
delicate
reserve
,
her
little
trial
,
the
last
pierce
pain
of
separation
....
<EOS>
I
retrace
these
thing
,
and
shake
my
head
incredulous
.
<EOS>
She
persist
.
<EOS>
"
the
child
of
seven
year
live
yet
in
the

of
seventeen

she
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
use
to
be
excessively
fond
of
Mrs.
Bretton

I
remark
,
intend
to
test
her

<EOS>
She
set
me
right
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
not

fond

"
say
she
;
"
I
like
her
:
<EOS>
I
respect
her
as
I
should
do
now
:
she
seem
to
me
very
little
altered

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
not

change
,
"
I
assent
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
silent
a
few
minute
.
<EOS>
glance
round
the
room
she
say
,
"
there
be
several
thing
here
that
use
to
be
at
Bretton
!
<EOS>
I
remember
that
pincushion
and
that
look

glass

"
  
<EOS>
evidently
she
be
not
deceive
in
her
estimate
of
her
own
memory
;
not
,
at
least
,
so
far
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
,
then
,
you
would
have
know
Mrs.
Bretton
?
<EOS>
"
I
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
perfectly
remember
her
;
the
turn
of
her
feature
,
her
olive
complexion
,
and
black
hair
,
her
height
,
her
walk
,
her
voice

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dr.
Bretton
,
of
course
,
"
I
pursue
,
"
would
be
out
of
the
question
:
and
,
indeed
,
as
I
see
your
first
interview
with
him
,
I
be
aware
that
he
appear
to
you
as
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
first
night
I
be
puzzle

she
answer

<EOS>
"
how
do
the
recognition
between
him

your
father
come
about

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
exchange
card
.
<EOS>
the
name
Graham
Bretton
and
Home
de
Bassompierre
give
rise
to
question
and
explanation
.
<EOS>
that
be
on
the
second
day
;
but
before
then
I
be
begin
to
know
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
 
know
something
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
she
say
,
"
how
strange
it
be
that
most
people
seem
so
slow
to
feel
the
truth
 
not
to
see
,
but
_
feel
_
!
<EOS>
when
Dr.
Bretton
have
visit
me
a
few
time
,
and
sit
near
and
talk
to
me
;
when
I
have
observe
the
look
in
his
eye
,
the
expression
about
his
mouth
,
the
form
of
his
chin
,
the
carriage
of
his
head
,
and
all
that
we
_
do
_
observe
in
person
who
approach
us
 
how
could
I
avoid
be
lead
by
association
to
think
of
Graham
Bretton
?
<EOS>
Graham
be
slight
than
he
,
and
not
grow
so
tall
,
and
have
a
smooth
face
,
and
longer
and
light
hair
,
and
speak
 
not
so
deeply
 
more
like
a
girl
;
but
yet
_
he
_
be
Graham
,
just
as
_
I
_
be
little
Polly
,
or
you
be
Lucy
Snowe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
the
same
,
but
I
wonder
to
find
my
thought
her
:
there
be
certain
thing
in
which
we
so
rarely
meet
with
our
double
that
it
seem
a
miracle
when
that
chance
befall
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
and
Graham
be
once
playmate
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
you
remember
that
?
"
<EOS>
she
question
in
her
turn
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
doubt
he
will
remember
it
also
,
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
ask
him
:
few
thing
would
surprise
me
so
much
as
to
find
that
he
do
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
his
disposition
be
still
gay
and
careless
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
so
formerly
?
<EOS>
do
it
so
strike
you
?
<EOS>
do
you
thus
remember
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
scarcely
remember
him
in
any
other
light
.
<EOS>
sometimes
he
be
studious
;
sometimes
he
be
merry
:
but
whether
busy
with
his
book
or
dispose
for
play
,
it
be
chiefly
the
book
or
game
he
think
of
;
not
much
heed
those
with
whom
he
read
or
amuse
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yet
to
you
he
be
partial
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
partial
to
me
?
<EOS>
oh
,
no
!
<EOS>
he
have
other
playmate
 
<EOS>
his
school
-
fellow
;
I
be
of
little
consequence
to
him
,
except
on
Sundays
:
<EOS>
yes
,
he
be
kind
on
Sundays
.
<EOS>
I
remember
walk
with
him
hand
-
in
-
hand
to
St.
Mary
's
,
and
his
find
the
place
in
my
prayer
-
book
;
and
how
good
and
still
he
be
on
Sunday
evening
!
<EOS>
so
mild
for
such
a
proud
,
lively
boy
;
so
patient
with
all
my
blunder
in
reading
;
and
so
wonderfully
to
be
depend
on
,
for
he
never
spend
those
evening
from
home
:
I
have
a
constant
fear
that
he
would
accept
some
invitation
and
forsake
us
;
but
he
never
do
,
nor
seem
ever
to
wish
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
thus
,
of
course
,
it
can
be
no
more
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
Sunday
will
now
be
Dr.
Bretton
's
dining
-
out
day
....
?

come
down

<EOS>
here
call
Mrs.

Paulina
would
still

I
incline

down

<EOS>
the
little
COUNTESS

Cheerful

she
make
a
point
of

there
be
no
true
enjoyment
that
evening
at
La
Terrasse
,
till
,
through
the
wild
howl
of
the
winter
-
night
,
be
hear
the
signal
sound
of
arrival
.
<EOS>
how
often
,
while
woman
and
girl
sit
warm
at
snug
fire
-
side
,
their
heart
and
imagination
be
doom
to
divorce
from
the
comfort
surround
their
person
,
force
out
by
night
to
wander
through
dark
way
,
to
dare
stress
of
weather
,
to
contend
with
the
snow
-
blast
,
to
wait
at
lonely
gate
and
stile
in
wildest
storm
,
watch
and
listen
to
see
and
hear
the
father
,
the
son

the

come
home

<EOS>
Father
and
son
come
at
last
to
the
château
:
for
the
Count
de
Bassompierre
that
night
accompany
Dr.
Bretton
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
which
of
our
trio
hear
the
horse
first
;
the
asperity
,
the
violence
of
the
weather
warrant
our
run
down
into
the
hall
to
meet
and
greet
the
two
rider
as
they
come
in
;
but
they
warn
us
to
keep
our
distance
:
both
be
white
 
two
mountain

snow
;
and
indeed
Mrs.
Bretton
,
see
their
condition
,
order
them
instantly
to
the
kitchen
;
prohibit
them
,
at
their
peril
,
from
set
foot
on
her
carpet
staircase
till
they
have
severally
put
off
that
mask
of
Old
Christmas
they
now
affect
.
<EOS>
into
the
kitchen
,
however
,
we
could
not
help
follow
them
:
it
be
a
large
old
dutch
kitchen
,
picturesque
and
pleasant
.
<EOS>
the
little
white
Countess
dance
in
a
circle
about
her
equally
white
sire
,
clap
her
hand
and
cry
,
"

"
  
<EOS>
the
bear
shake
himself

flee
far
from
the
frozen
shower
.
<EOS>
back
she
come
,
however
,
laughing
,
and
eager
to

the
arctic

.
<EOS>
the
Count

at
last
issuing
from
his

with
it
as

<EOS>
"

bend
to

when
it
be
playfully
advanced
above

bound
out

<EOS>
Her

have
the

the

her

cold
hand
and
rub
them
,
and
stand
on
tiptoe
to
reach
his
lip
for
a
kiss

there
seem
to
shine
round
her
a
halo
of
love
delight

<EOS>
the

down

<EOS>
at
last
the
Doctor
relent
,
take
it
down
,
and
indulge
himself
in
the
gratification
of
let
her
taste
from
his
hand
;
his
eye
,
always
expressive
in
the
revelation
of
pleasurable
feeling
,
luminously
and
smilingly
avow
that
it
_
be
_
a
gratification
;
and
he
prolong
it
by
so
regulate
the
position
of
the
cup
that
only
a
drop
at
a
time
could
reach
the
rosy
,
sip
lip
by
which
its
brim
be
court
.
  
<EOS>
"
a

more
 
<EOS>
a
little
more
,
"
say
she
,
petulantly
touch
his
hand
with
the
forefinger
,
to
make
him
incline
the
cup
more
generously
and
yieldingly
.
<EOS>
"
It
smell
of
spice
and
sugar
,
but
I
can
not
taste
it
;
your
wrist
be
so
stiff
,
and
you
be
so
stingy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
indulge
her
,
whisper
,
however
,
with
gravity
:
"
do
not
tell
my
mother
or
Lucy
;
they
would
not
approve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nor
do
I
,
"
say
she
,
pass
into
another
tone
and
manner
as
soon
as
she
have
fairly
assay
the
beverage
,
just
as
if
it
have
act
upon
her
like
some
disenchant
draught
,
undo
the
work
of
a
wizard
<EOS>
:
"
I
find
it
anything
but
sweet
;
it
be
bitter
and
hot
,
and
take
away
my
breath
.

Your
old
October
be
only
desirable
while
forbid

<EOS>
thank
you
,
no
more

"
  
<EOS>
and
,
with
a
slight
bend
 
careless
,
but
as
graceful
as
her
dance
 
<EOS>
she
glide
from
him
and
rejoin
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
she
have
speak
truth
:
the
child
of
seven
be
in
the
girl
of
seventeen
.
  
<EOS>
Graham
look
after
her
a
little
baffle
,
a
little
puzzled
;
his
eye
be
on
her
a
good
deal
during
the
rest
of
the
evening
,
but
she
do
not
seem
to
notice
him
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
ascend
to
the
drawing
-
room
for
tea
,
she
take
her
father
's
arm
:
her
natural
place
seem
to
be
at
his
side
;
her
eye
and
her
ear
be
dedicated
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
and
Mrs.
Bretton
be
the
chief
talker
of
our
little
party
,
and
Paulina
be
their
good
listener
,
attend
closely
to
all
that
be

,
prompt
the
repetition
of
this
or
that
trait
or
adventure
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
where
be
you
at
such
a
time
,
papa

<EOS>
and
what
do
you
say
then
?
<EOS>
and
tell
Mrs.
Bretton
what
happen
on
that
occasion

"
<EOS>
thus
she
draw
him
out
.
  
<EOS>
She
do
not
again
yield
to
any
effervescence
of
glee
;
the
infantine
sparkle
be
exhale
for
the
night
:
she
be
soft
,
thoughtful
,
and
docile
.
<EOS>
It
be
pretty
to
see
her
bid
good
-
night
;
her
manner
to
Graham
be
touch
with
dignity
:
in
her
very
slight
smile
and
quiet
bow
speak
the
Countess
,
and
Graham
could
not
but
look
grave
,
and
bend
responsive
.
<EOS>
I
see
he
hardly
know
how
to
blend
together
in
his
idea
the
dancing
fairy
and
delicate
dame
.
  
<EOS>
next
day
,
when
we
be
all
assemble
round
the
breakfast
-
table
,
shivering
and
fresh
from
the
morning
's
chill
ablution

Mrs.

pronounce
a
decree
that
nobody
,
who
be
not
force
by
dire
necessity
,
should
quit
her
house
that
day

<EOS>
indeed
,
egress
seem
next
to
impossible
;
the
drift
darken
the
low
pane
of
the
casement
,
and
,
on
look
out
,
one
see
the
sky
and
air
vexed
and
dim
,
the
wind
and
snow
in
angry
conflict

<EOS>
there
be
no

what

<EOS>
"
I
be
a
teacher

"
I
say
,
and
be
rather
glad
of
the
opportunity
of
say
this
.
<EOS>
for
a
little
while
I
have
be
feel
as
if
place
in
a
false
position
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
and
son
know
my
circumstance
;
but
the
Count
and
his
daughter
do
not
.
<EOS>
They
may
choose
to
vary
by
some
shade
their
hitherto
cordial
manner
towards
me
,
when
aware
of
my
grade
in
society
.
<EOS>
I
speak
then
readily
:
but
a
swarm
of
thought
I
have
not
anticipate
nor
invoke
,
rise
dim
at
the
word
,
make
me
sigh
involuntarily
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Home
do
not
lift
his
eye
from
his
breakfast
-
plate
for
about
two
minute
,
nor
do
he
speak
;
perhaps
he
have
not
catch
the
word
 
<EOS>
perhaps
he
think
that
on
a
confession
of
that
nature
,
politeness
would
interdict
comment
:
the
Scotch
be
proverbially
proud
;
and
homely
as
be
Mr.
Home
in
look
,
simple
in
habit
and
taste
,
I
have
all
along
intimate
that
he
be
not
without
his
share
of
the
national
quality
.
<EOS>
be
his
a
pseudo
pride
?
<EOS>
be
it
real
dignity
?
<EOS>
I
leave
the
question
undecided
in
its
wide
sense
.
<EOS>
where
it
concern
me
individually
I
can
only
answer
:
then
,
and
always
,
he
show
himself
a
true
-
hearted
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
by
nature
he
be
a
feeler
and
a
thinker
;
over
his
emotion
and
his
reflection
spread
a
mellowing
of
melancholy
;
more
than
a
mellowing
:
in
trouble
and
bereavement
it
become
a
cloud
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
much
about
Lucy
Snowe
;
what
he
know
,
he
do
not
very
accurately
comprehend
:
indeed
his
misconception
of
my
character
often
make
me
smile
;
but
he
see
my
walk
in
life
lie
rather
on
the
shady
side
of
the
hill
:
he
give
me
credit
for
do
my
endeavour
to
keep
the
course
honestly
straight
;
he
would
have
help
me
if
he
could
:
have
no
opportunity
of
help
,
he
still
wish
me
well
.
<EOS>
when
he
do
look
at
me
,
his
eye
be
kind
;
when
he
do
speak
,
his
voice
be
benevolent
.
  
<EOS>
"
yours
,
"
say
he
,
"
be
an
arduous
calling
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
health
and
strength
to
win
in
it
 
success
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
fair
little
daughter
do
not
take
the
information
quite
so
composedly
:
she
fix
on
me
a
pair
of
eye
wide
with
wonder
 
almost
with
dismay
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
a
teacher
?
"
cry
she
.
<EOS>
then
,
have
pause
on
the
unpalatable
idea
,
"
well
,
I
never
know
what
you
be
,
nor

of
ask
:
<EOS>
for
me
,
you
be
always
Lucy
Snowe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
be
I
now
?
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
forbear
inquire
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yourself
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
but
do
you
really
teach
here
,
in
Villette
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
you
like
it
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
always
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
why
do
you
go
on
with
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
father
look
at
,
and
,
I
fear
,
be
go
to
check
her
;
but
he
only
say
,
"
proceed
,
Polly
,
proceed
with
that
catechism
 
prove
yourself
the
little
wiseacre
you
be

<EOS>
if
Miss
Snowe
be
to
blush
and
look
confused
,
I
should
have
to
bid
you
hold
your
tongue
;
and
you
and
I
would
sit
out
the
present
meal
in
some
disgrace
;
but
she
only
smile
,
so
push
her
hard
,
multiply
the
cross
-
question
.
<EOS>
well
,
Miss
Snowe
,
why
do
you
go
on
with
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
chiefly
,
I
fear
,
for
the
sake
of
the
money
I
get
.
"
  
"
not
then
from
motive
of
pure
philanthropy
?
<EOS>
polly
and
I
be
cling
to
that
hypothesis
as
the
most
lenient
way
of
account
for
your
eccentricity
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
no
 
no
,
sir
.
<EOS>
rather
for
the
roof
of
shelter
I
be
thus
enable
to
keep
over
my
head
;
and
for
the
comfort
of
mind
it
give
me
to
think
that
while
I
can
work
for
myself
,
I
be
spare
the
pain
of
be
a
burden
to
anybody

<EOS>

take
up
that
pity
,
Miss
de

take
it
up
in
both
hand

as
you
may
a
little
callow
gosle
squattere
out
of
bound
without
leave

put
it
back
in
the
warm
nest
of
a
heart
whence
it
issue
,
and
receive
in
your
ear
this
whisper

<EOS>
if
my
Polly
ever
come
to
know
by
experience
the
uncertain
nature
of
this
world

good

I
should
like
her
to
act
as
Lucy
act
:
to
work
for
herself

that
she
may
burden
neither
kith
nor
kin

papa

she

pensively

tractably

poor
Lucy

<EOS>
I
think
she
be
a
rich
lady

have
rich
friend

<EOS>

You
think
like
a
little
simpleton

<EOS>
_
I
_
never

so

<EOS>
when
I
have
time
to
consider
Lucy
's
manner
and
aspect
,
which
be
not
often
,
I
see
she
be
one
who
have
to
guard
and
not
be
guard
;
to
act
and
not
be
serve
:
and
<EOS>
this
lot
have
,
I
imagine
,
help
her
to
an
experience
for
which
,
if
she
live
long
enough
to
realize
its
full
benefit
,
she
may
yet
bless
Providence

this
school

he
pursue
,
change
his
tone
from
grave
to
gay

would
Madame
Beck
admit
my
Polly
,
do
you
think
,
Miss
Lucy
?

<EOS>
I
say
,
there
need
but
to
try
Madame
;
it
would
soon
be
see
:
she
be
fond
of
english
pupil
.
<EOS>
"
if
you

I
add
,

will

take
Miss

can
answer

Rosine

not

slow

life
this
morning
.
<EOS>
ah
,
my
little
girl
,
thou
hast
much
to
learn
;
and
papa
ought
to
have
teach
thee
more
than
he
have
do
!
<EOS>
come
,
there
be
nothing
for
it
but
to
try
Madame
Beck
;
and
the
weather
seem
settle
,
and
I
have
finish
my
breakfast
 
"
  
"
but
,
papa
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
an
obstacle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
enormous
,
papa
;
it
can
never
be
get
over
;
it
be
as
large
as
you
in
your
greatcoat
,
and
the
snowdrift
on
the
top
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
,
like
that
snowdrift
,
capable
of
melt
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
it
be
of
too
 
too
solid
flesh
:
it
be
just
your
own
self
.
<EOS>
Miss
Lucy
,
warn
Madame
Beck
not
to
listen
to
any
overture
about
take
me
,
because
,
in
the
end
,
it
would
turn
out
that
she
would
have
to
take
papa
too
:
as
he
be
so
teasing
,
I
will
just
tell
tale
about
him
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
and
all
of
you
listen
:
<EOS>
about
five
year
ago
,
when
I
be
twelve
year
old
,
he
take
it
into
his
head
that
he
be
spoil
me
;
that
I
be
grow
unfitted
for
the
world
,
and
I
do
not
know
what
,
and
nothing
would
serve
or
satisfy
him
,
but
I
must
go
to
school
.
<EOS>
I
cry
,
and
so
on
;
but
M.
de
Bassompierre
prove
hard
-
hearted
,
quite
firm
and
flinty
,
and
to
school
I
go
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
result
?
<EOS>
in
the
most
admirable
manner
,
papa
come
to
school
likewise
:
every
other
day
he
call
to
see
me
.
<EOS>
Madame
Aigredoux
grumble
,
but
it
be
of
no
use
;
and
so
,
at
last
,
papa
and
I
be
both
,
in
a
manner
,
expel
.
<EOS>
Lucy
can
just
tell
Madame
Beck
this
little
trait
:
it
be
only
fair
to
let
her
know
what
she
have
to
expect
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
ask
Mr.
Home
what
he
have
to
say
in
answer
to
this
statement
.
<EOS>
as
he
make
no
defence
,
judgment
be
give
against
him
,
and
Paulina
triumph
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
have
other
mood
besides
the
arch
and
naïve
.
<EOS>
after
breakfast
;
when
the
two
elder
withdraw
 
I
suppose
to
talk
over
certain
of
Mrs.
Bretton
's
business
matter
 
and
the
Countess
,
Dr.
Bretton
,
and
I
,
be
for
a
short
time
alone
together
 
<EOS>
all
the
child
leave
her
;
with
us
,
more
nearly
her
companion
in
age
,
she
rise
at
once
to
the
little
lady
:
<EOS>
her
very
face
seem
to
alter
;
that
play
of
feature
,
and
candour
of
look
,
which
,
when
she
speak
to
her
father
,
make
it
quite
dimpled
and
round
,
yield
to
an
aspect
more
thoughtful
,
and
line
distincter
and
less
_
mobile
_
.
  
<EOS>
no
doubt
Graham
note
the
change
as
well
as
I.
<EOS>
He
stand
for
some
minute
near
the
window
,
look
out
at
the
snow
;
presently
he
,
approach
the
hearth
,
and
enter
into
conversation
,
but
not
quite
with
his
usual
ease
:
fit
topic
do
not
seem
to
rise
to
his
lip
;
he
choose
them
fastidiously
,
hesitatingly
,
and
consequently
infelicitously
:
he
speak
vaguely
of
Villette
 
<EOS>
its
inhabitant
,
its
notable
sight
and
building
.
<EOS>
He
be
answer
by
Miss
de
Bassompierre
in
quite
womanly
sort
;
with
intelligence
,
with
a
manner
not
indeed
wholly
disindividualize
:
a
tone
,
a
glance
,
a
gesture
,
here
and
there
,
rather
animated
and
quick
than
measured
and
stately
,
still
recall
little
Polly
;
but
yet
there
be
so
fine
and
even
a
polish
,
so
calm
and
courteous
a
grace
,
gilding
and
sustain
these
peculiarity
,
that
a
less
sensitive
man
than
Graham
would
not
have
venture
to
seize
upon
them
as
vantage
point
,
lead
to
franker
intimacy
.
  
<EOS>
yet
while
Dr.
Bretton
continue
subdue
,
and
,
for
him
,
sedate
,
he
be
still
observant
.
<EOS>
not
one
of
those
petty
impulse
and
natural
break
escape
him
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
miss
one
characteristic
movement
,
one
hesitation
in
language
,
or
one
lisp
in
utterance
.
<EOS>
at
time
,
in
speak
fast
,
she
still
lisp
;
but
colour
whenever
such
lapse
occur
,
and
in
a
painstaking
,
conscientious
manner
,
quite
as
amusing
as
the
slight
error
,
repeat
the
word
more
distinctly
.
  
<EOS>
whenever
she
do
this
,
Dr.
Bretton
smile
.
<EOS>
gradually
,
as
they
converse
,
the
restraint
on
each
side
slacken
:
may
the
conference
have
but
be
prolong
,
I
believe
it
would
soon
have
become
genial
:
already
to
Paulina
's
lip
and
cheek
return
the
wreathing
,
dimple
smile
;
she
lisp
once
,
and
forget
to
correct
herself
.
<EOS>
and
Dr.
John
,
I
know
not
how
_
he
_
change
,
but
change
he
do
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
grow
gayer
 
<EOS>
no
raillery
,
no
levity
sparkle
across
his
aspect
 
but
his
position
seem
to
become
one
of
more
pleasure
to
himself
,
and
he
speak
his
augment
comfort
in
ready
language
,
in
tone
more
suave
.
<EOS>
ten
year
ago
this
pair
have
always
find
abundance
to
say
to
each
other
;
the
intervene
decade
have
not
narrow
the
experience
or
impoverish
the
intelligence
of
either
:
besides
,
there
be
certain
nature
of
which
the
mutual
influence
be
such
,
that
the
more
they
say
,
the
more
they
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
for
these
out
of
association
grow
adhesion
,
and
out
of
adhesion
,
amalgamation
.
  
<EOS>
Graham
,
however
,
must
go
:
his
be
a
profession
whose
claim
be
neither
to
be
ignore
nor
defer
.
<EOS>
He
leave
the
room
;
but
before
he
could
leave
the
house
there
be
a
return
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
he
come
back
 
not
for
the
paper
,
or
card
in
his
desk
,
which
form
his
ostensible
errand
 
but
to
assure
himself
,
by
one
more
glance
,
that
Paulina
's
aspect
be
really
such
as
memory
be
bear
away
:
that
he
have
not
be
view
her
somehow
by
a
partial
,
artificial
light
,
and
make
a
fond
mistake
.
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
he
find
the
impression
true
 
rather
<EOS>
,
indeed
,
he
gain
than
lose
by
this
return
:
he
take
away
with
him
a
parting
look
 
<EOS>
shy
,
but
very
soft
 
as
beautiful
,
as
innocent
,
as
any
little
fawn
could
lift
out
of
its
cover
of
fern
,
or
any
lamb
from
its
meadow
-
bed
.
  
<EOS>
be
leave
alone
,
Paulina
<EOS>
and
I
keep
silence
for
some
time
<EOS>
:
we
both
take
out
some
work
,
and
ply
a
mute
and
diligent
task
.
<EOS>
the
white
-
wood
workbox
of
old
day
be
now
replace
by
one
inlaid
with
precious
mosaic
,
and
furnish
with
implement
of
gold
;
the
tiny
and
tremble
finger
that
could
scarce
guide
the
needle
,
though
tiny
still
,
be
now
swift
and
skilful
:
but
there
be
the
same
busy
knitting
of
the
brow
,
the
same
little
dainty
mannerism
,
the
same
quick
turn
and
movement
 
now
to
replace
a
stray
tress
,
and
anon
to
shake
from
the
silken
skirt
some
imaginary
atom
of
dust
 
<EOS>
some
cling
fibre
of
thread
.
  
<EOS>
that
morning
I
be
dispose
for
silence
:
<EOS>
the
austere
fury
of
the
winter
-
day
have
on
me
an
awing
,
hush
influence
.
<EOS>
that
passion
of
January
,
so
white
and
so
bloodless
,
be
not
yet
spend
:
the
storm
have
rave
itself
hoarse
,
but
seem
no
near
exhaustion
.
<EOS>
have
Ginevra
Fanshawe
be
my
companion
in
that
drawing
-
room
,
she
would
not
have
suffer
me
to
muse
and
listen
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
the
presence
just
go
from
us
would
have
be
her
theme
;
and
how
she
would
have
ring
the
change
on
one
topic
!
<EOS>
how
she
would
have
pursue
and
pester
me
with
question
and
surmise
 
worry
and
oppress
me
with
comment
and
confidence
I
do
not
want
,
and
long
to
avoid
.
  
<EOS>
Paulina
Mary
cast
once
or
twice
towards
me
a
quiet
but
penetrate
glance
of
her
dark
,
full
eye
;
her
lip
half
open
,
as
if
to
the
impulse
of
come
utterance
:
but
she
see
and
delicately
respect
my
inclination
for
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
will
not
hold
long
,
"
I
think
to
myself
;
for
I
be
not
accustomed
to
find
in
woman
or
girl
any
power
of
self
-
control
,
or
strength
of
self
-
denial
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
I
know
them
,
the
chance
of
a
gossip
about
their
usually
trivial
secret
,
their
often
very
washy
and
paltry
feeling
,
be
a
treat
not
to
be
readily
forego
.
  
<EOS>
the
little
Countess
promise
an
exception
:
she
sew
till
she
be
tired
of
sewing
,
and
then
she
take
a
book
.
  
<EOS>
as
chance
would
have
it
,
she
have
seek
it
in
Dr.
Bretton
's
own
compartment
of
the
bookcase
;
and
it
prove
to
be
an
old
Bretton
book
 
some
illustrate
work
of
natural
history
.
<EOS>
often
have
I
see
her
standing
at
Graham
's
side
,
rest
that
volume
on
his
knee
,
and
read
to
his
tuition
;
and
,
when
the
lesson
be
over
,
beg
,
as
a
treat
,
that
he
would
tell
her
all
about
the
picture
.
<EOS>
I
watch
her
keenly
:
here
be
a
true
test
of
that
memory
she
have
boast
would
her
recollection
now
be
faithful
?
  
<EOS>
faithful
?
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
doubt
.
<EOS>
as
she
turn
the
leave
,
over
her
face
pass
gleam
after
gleam
of
expression
,
the
least
intelligent
of
which
be
a
full
greeting
to
the
past
.
<EOS>
and
then
she
turn
to
the
title
-
page
,
and
look
at
the
name
write
in
the
schoolboy
hand
.
<EOS>
She
look
at
it
long
;
nor
be
she
satisfied
with
merely
look
:
she
gently
pass
over
the
character
the
tip
of
her
finger
,
accompany
the
action
with
an
unconscious
but
tender
smile
,
which
convert
the
touch
into
a
caress
.
<EOS>
Paulina
love
the
past
;
but
the
peculiarity
of
this
little
scene
be
,
that
she
_
say
_
<EOS>
nothing
<EOS>
:
she
could
feel
without
pour
out
her
feeling
in
a
flux
of
word
.
  
<EOS>
She
now
occupy
herself
at
the
bookcase
for
nearly
an
hour
;
take
down
volume
after
volume
,
and
renew
her
acquaintance
with
each
.
<EOS>
this
done
,
she
seat
herself
on
a
low
stool
,
rest
her
cheek
on
her
hand
,
and
think
,
and
still
be
mute
.
  
<EOS>
the
sound
of
the
front
door
open
below
,
a
rush
of
cold
wind
,
and
her
father
's
voice
speak
to
Mrs.
Bretton
in
the
hall
,
startle
her
at
last
.
<EOS>
She
spring
up
:
<EOS>
she
be
down
-
stair
in
one
second
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
!
papa
!
<EOS>
you
be
not
go
out
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
pet
,
I
must
go
into
town
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
too
 
_
too
_
cold
,
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
then
I
hear
M.
de
Bassompierre
show
to
her
how
he
be
well
provide
against
the
weather
;
and
how
he
be
go
to
have
the
carriage
,
and
to
be
quite
snugly
sheltered
;
and
,
in
short
,
prove
that
she
nee
not
fear
for
his
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
will
promise
to
come
back
here
this
evening
,
before
it
be
quite
dark
;
 
you
and
Dr.
Bretton
,
both
,
in
the
carriage
?
<EOS>
It
be
not
fit
to
ride
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
if
I
see
the
Doctor
,
I
will
tell
him
a
lady
have
lay
on
him
her
command
to
take
care
of
his
precious
health
and
come
home
early
under
my
escort
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
you
must
say
a
lady
;
and
he
will
think
it
be
his
mother
,
and
be
obedient
<EOS>
and
,
papa
,
mind
to
come
soon
,
for
I
_
shall
_
watch
and
listen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
door
close
,
and
the
carriage
roll
softly
through
the
snow
;
and
back
return
the
Countess
,
pensive
and
anxious
.
  
<EOS>
She
_
do
_
listen
,
and
watch
,
when
evening
close
;
but
it
be
in
still
sort
:
walk
the
drawing
-
room
with
quite
noiseless
step
.
<EOS>
She
check
at
interval
her
velvet
march
;
incline
her
ear
,
and
consult
the
night
sound
:
I
should
rather
say
,
the
night
silence
;
for
now
,
at
last
,
the
wind
be
fall
.
<EOS>
the
sky
,
relieve
of
its
avalanche
,
lie
naked
and
pale
:
through
the
barren
bough
of
the
avenue
we
could
see
it
well
,
and
note
also
the
polar
splendour
of
the
new
-
year
moon
 
an
orb
white
as
a
world
of
ice
.
<EOS>
nor
be
it
late
when
we
see
also
the
return
of
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
Paulina
have
no
dance
of
welcome
for
this
evening
.
<EOS>
It
be
with
a
sort
of
gravity
that
she
take
immediate
possession
of
her
father
,
as
he
enter
the
room
;
but
she
at
once
make
him
her
entire
property
,
lead
him
to
the
seat
of
her
choice
,
and
,
while
softly
shower
round
him
honey
word
of
commendation
for
be
so
good
and
come
home
<EOS>
so
soon
,
you
would
have
think
it
be
entirely
by
the
power
of
her
little
hand
he
be
put
into
his
chair
,
and
settle
and
arrange
;
for
the
strong
man
seem
to
take
pleasure
in
wholly
yield
himself
to
this
dominion
-
potent
only
by
love
.
  
<EOS>
Graham
do
not
appear
till
some
minute
after
the
Count
.
<EOS>
Paulina
half
turn
when
his
step
be
hear
:
they
speak
,
but
only
a
word
or
two
;
their
finger
meet
a
moment
,
but
obviously
with
slight
contact
.
<EOS>
Paulina
remain
beside
her
father
;
Graham
throw
himself
into
a
seat
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
well
that
Mrs.
Bretton
and
Mr.
Home
have
a
great
deal
to
say
to
each
other
-
almost
an
inexhaustible
fund
of
discourse
in
old
recollection
;
otherwise
,
I
think
,
our
party
would
have
be
but
a
still
one
that
evening
.
  
<EOS>
after
tea
,
Paulina
's
quick
needle

her

<EOS>
Graham
,
too
,
must
have
be
tired
with
his
day
's
work
:
he
listen
dutifully
to
his
elder
and
better
,
say
very
little
himself
,
and
follow
with
his
eye
the
gilded
glance
of
Paulina
's
thimble
;
as
if
it
have
be
some
bright
moth
on
the
wing
,
or
the
golden
head
of
some
dart
little
yellow
serpent
.
    
<EOS>
a
burial
.
  
<EOS>
from
this
date
my
life
do
not
want
variety
;
I
go
out
a
good
deal
,
with
the
entire
consent
of
Madame
Beck
,
who
perfectly
approve
the
grade
of
my
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
that
worthy
directress
have
never
from
the
first
treat
me
otherwise
than
with
respect
;
and
when
she
find
that
I
be
liable
to
frequent
invitation
from
a
château
and
a
great
hotel
,
respect
improve
into
distinction
.
  
<EOS>
not
that
she
be
fulsome
about
it
:
<EOS>
Madame
,
in
all
thing
worldly
,
be
in
nothing
weak
;
there
be
measure
and
sense
in
her
hot
pursuit
of
self
-
interest
,
calm
and
considerateness
in
her
close
clutch
of
gain
;
without
,
then
,
lay
herself
open
to
my
contempt
as
a
time
-
server
and
a
toadie
,
she
mark
with
tact
that
she
be
pleased
people
connect
with
her
establishment
<EOS>
should
frequent
such
associate
as
must
cultivate
and
elevate
,
rather
than
those
who
may
deteriorate
and
depress
.
<EOS>
She
never
praise
either
me
or
my
friend
;
only
once
when
she
be
sit
in
the
sun
in
the
garden
,
a
cup
of
coffee
at
her
elbow
and
the
Gazette
in
her
hand
,
look
very
comfortable
,
and
I
come
up
and
ask
leave
of
absence
for
the
evening
,
she
deliver
herself
in
this
gracious
sort
:
    
<EOS>
"
Oui

<EOS>
She
close
her
lip
and
resume
the
Gazette
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
will
not
too
gravely
regard
the
little
circumstance
that
about
this
time
the
triply
-
enclose
packet
of
five
letter
temporarily
disappear
from
my
bureau

<EOS>
blank
dismay
be
naturally
my
first
sensation
on
make
the
discovery

but
in
a
moment
I
take
heart
of
grace

<EOS>
"
patience

"
<EOS>
whisper
I
to
myself

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
let
me
say
nothing

but
wait
peaceably
;
they
will
come
back
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
they
do
come
back
<EOS>
:
they
have
only
be
on
a
short
visit
to
Madame
's
chamber
;
have
pass
their
examination
,
they
come
back
duly
and
truly
:
<EOS>
I
find
them
all
right
the
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
she
think
of
my
correspondence
?
<EOS>
what
estimate
do
she
form
of
Dr.
John
Bretton
's
epistolary
power
?
<EOS>
in
what
light
do
the
often
very
pithy
thought
,
the
generally
sound
,
and
sometimes
original
opinion
,
set
,
without
pretension
,
in
an
easily
-
flow
,
spirited
style
,
appear
to
her
?
<EOS>
how
do
she
like
that
genial
,
half
<EOS>
humorous
vein
,
which
to
me
give
such
delight
?
<EOS>
what
do
she
think
of
the
few
kind
word
scatter
here
and
there
-
not
thickly
,
as
the
diamond
be
scatter
in
the
valley
of
Sindbad
,
but
sparely
,
as
those
gem
lie
in
unfabled
bed
?
<EOS>
oh
,
Madame
Beck
!
<EOS>
how
seem
these
thing
to
you
?
  
<EOS>
I
think
in
Madame
Beck
's
eye
the
five
letter
find
a
certain
favour
.
<EOS>
one
day
after
she
have
_
borrow
_
them
of
me
(
in
speak
of
so
suave
a
little
woman
,
one
ought
to
use
suave
term
)
<EOS>
,
I
catch
her
examine
me
with
a
steady
contemplative
gaze
,
a
little
puzzled
,
but
not
at
all
malevolent
.
<EOS>
It
be
during
that
brief
space
between
lesson
,
when
the
pupil
turn
out
into
the
court
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
's
recreation
;
she
and
I
remain
in
the
first
classe
alone
:
when
I
meet
her
eye
,
her
thought
force
themselves
partially
through
her
lip
.
  
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
She

add
,
get
up
and

away
like

she
be

<EOS>
"
then
I
hope

murmur
I
to
myself
,
"
you

<EOS>
alas

<EOS>
something
come
rush
into
my
eye
,
dim
utterly
their
vision
,
blot
from
sight
the
schoolroom
,
the
garden
,
the
bright
winter
sun
,
as
I
remember
that
never
more
would
letter
,
such
as
she
have
read
,
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
the
last
of
them
.
<EOS>
that
goodly
river
on
whose
bank
I
have
sojourn
,
of
whose
wave
a
few
reviving
drop
have
trickle
to
my
lip
,
be
bend
to
another
course
:
it
be
leave
my
little
hut
and
field
forlorn
and
sand
-
dry
,
pour
its
wealth
of
water
far
away
.
<EOS>
the
change
be
right
,
just
,
natural
;
not
a
word
could
be
say
:
but
I
love
my
Rhine
,
my
Nile
;
I
have
almost
worship
my
gange
,
and
I
grieve
that
the
grand
tide
should
roll
estranged
,
should
vanish
like
a
false
mirage
.
<EOS>
though
stoical
,
I
be
not
quite
a
stoic
;
drop
stream
fast
on
my
hand
,
on
my
desk
:
I
weep
one
sultry
shower
,
heavy
and
brief
.
  
<EOS>
but
soon
I
say
to
myself
,
"
the
Hope
I
be
bemoan
suffer
and
make
me
suffer
much
<EOS>
:
it
do
not
die
till
it
be
full
time
:
follow
an
agony
so
linger
,
death
ought
to
be
welcome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
welcome
I
endeavour
to
make
it
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
long
pain
have
make
patience
a
habit
.
<EOS>
in
the
end
I
close
the
eye
of
my
dead
,
cover
its
face
,
and
compose
its
limb
with
great
calm
.
  
<EOS>
the
letter
,
however
,
must
be
put
away
,
out
of
sight
:
people
who
have
undergo
bereavement
always
jealously
gather
together
and
lock
away
memento
:
it
be
not
supportable
to
be
stab
to
the
heart
each
moment
by
sharp
revival
of
regret
.
  
<EOS>
one
vacant
holiday
afternoon
(
the
Thursday
)
go
to
my
treasure
,
with
intent
to
consider
its
final
disposal
,
I
perceive
 
and
<EOS>
this
time
with
a
strong
impulse
of
displeasure
 
that
it
have
be
again
tamper
with
:
<EOS>
the
packet
be
there
,
indeed
,
but
the
ribbon
which
secure
it
have
be
untie
and
retied
;
and
by
other
symptom
I
know
that
my
drawer
have
be
visit
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
little
too
much
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
herself
be
the
soul
of
discretion
,
besides
have
as
strong
a
brain
and
sound
a
judgment
as
ever
furnish
a
human
head
;
that
she
should
know
the
content
of
my
casket
,
be
not
pleasant
,
but
may
be
bear
.
<EOS>
Little
Jesuit
inquisitress
as
she
be
,
she
could
see
thing
in
a
true
light
,
and
understand
them
in
an
unperverted
sense
;
but
the
idea
that
she
have
venture
to
communicate
information
,
thus
gain
,
to
other
;
that
she
have
,
perhaps
,
amuse
herself
with
a
companion
over
document
,
in
my
eye
most
sacred
,
shock
me
cruelly
.
<EOS>
yet
,
that
such
be
the
case
I
now
see
reason
to
fear
;
I
even
guess
her
confidant
.
<EOS>
Her
kinsman
,
M.
Paul
Emanuel
,
have
spend
yesterday
evening
with
her
:
she
be
much
in
the
habit
of
consult
him
,
and
of
discuss
with
him
matter
she
broach
to
no
one
else
.
<EOS>
this
very
morning
,
in
class
,
that
gentleman
have
favour
me
with
a
glance
which
he
seem
to
have
borrow
from
Vashti
,
the
actress
<EOS>
;
I
have
not
at
the
moment
comprehend
that
blue
,
yet
lurid
,
flash
out
of
his
angry
eye
;
but
I
read
its
meaning
now
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
,
I
believe
,
be
not
apt
to
regard
what
concern
me
from
a
fair
point
of
view
,
nor
to
judge
me
with
tolerance
and
candour
:
I
have
always
find
him
severe
and
suspicious
:
<EOS>
the
thought
that
these
letter
,
mere
friendly
letter
as
they
be
,
have
fall
once
,
and
may
fall
again
,
into
his
hand
,
jar
my
very
soul
.
  
<EOS>
what
should
I
do
to
prevent
this
?
<EOS>
in
what
corner
of
this
strange
house
be
it
possible
to
find
security
or
secresy
?
<EOS>
where
could
a
key
be
a
safeguard
,
or
a
padlock
a
barrier
?
  
<EOS>
in
the
grenier
?
<EOS>
no
,
I
do
not
like
the
grenier
.
<EOS>
besides
,
most
of
the
box
and
drawer
there
be
moulder
,
and
do
not
lock
.
<EOS>
rat
,
too
,
gnaw
their
way
through
the
decayed
wood
;
and
mouse
make
nest
amongst
the
litter
of
their
content
:
my
dear
letter
(
most
dear
still
,
though
Ichabod
be
write
on
their
cover
)
may
be
consume
by
vermin
;
certainly
the
writing
would
soon
become
obliterate
by
damp
.
<EOS>
no
;
the
grenier
would
not
do
 
but
<EOS>
where
then
?
  
<EOS>
while
ponder
this
problem
,
I
sit
in
the
dormitory
window
-
seat
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
fine
frosty
afternoon
;
the
winter
sun
,
already
set
,
gleamed
pale
on
the
top
of
the
garden
-
shrub
in
the
"
allée
défendue
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
one
great
old
pear
-
tree
 
<EOS>
the
nun
's
pear
-
tree
 
stand
up
a
tall
dryad
skeleton
,
grey
,
gaunt
,
and
strip
.
<EOS>
a
thought
strike
me
 
one
of
those
queer
fantastic
thought
that
will
sometimes
strike
solitary
people
.
<EOS>
I
put
on
my
bonnet
,
cloak
,
and
fur
,
and
go
out
into
the
city
.
  
<EOS>
bend
my
step
to
the
old
historical
quarter
of
the
town
,
whose
hoax
and
overshadowed
precinct
I
always
seek
by
instinct
in
melancholy
mood
,
I
wander
on
from
street
to
street
,
till
,
have
cross
a
half
deserted
"
place
"
or
square
,
I
find
myself
before
a
sort
of
broker
's
shop
;
an
ancient
place
,
full
of
ancient
thing
.
<EOS>
what
I
want
be
a
metal
box
which
may
be
solder
,
or
a
thick
glass
jar
or
bottle
which
may
be
stopper
or
seal
hermetically
.
<EOS>
amongst
miscellaneous
heap
,
I
find
and
purchase
the
latter
article
.
  
<EOS>
I
then
make
a
little
roll
of
my
letter
,
wrap
them
in
oil
silk
,
bind
them
with
twine
,
and
,
have
put
them
in
the
bottle
,
get
the
old
Jew
broker
to
stopper
,
seal
,
and
make
it
air
-
tight
.
<EOS>
while
obey
my
direction
,
he
glance
at
me
now
and
then
suspiciously
from
under
his
frost
-
white
eyelash
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
think
there
be
some
evil
deed
on
hand
.
<EOS>
in
all
this
I
have
a
dreary
something
 
not
pleasure
 
but
a
sad
,
lonely
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
the
impulse
under
which
I
act
,
the
mood
control
me
,
be
similar
to
the
impulse
and
the
mood
which
have
induce
me
to
visit
the
confessional
.
<EOS>
with
quick
walking
I
regain
the
pensionnat
just
at
dark
,
and
in
time
for
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
at
seven
o'clock
the
moon
rise
.
<EOS>
at
half
-
past
seven
,
when
the
pupil
and
teacher
be
at
study
,
and
Madame
Beck
be
with
her
mother
and
child
in
the
salle

manger
,
when
the
half
-
boarder
be
all
go
home
,
and
Rosine
have
leave
the
vestibule
,
and
all
be
still
 
I
shawle
myself
,
and
,
take
the
seal
jar
,
steal
out
through
the
first
-
classe
door
,
into
the
berceau
and
thence
into
the
"
allée
défendue

<EOS>
Methusaleh
,
the
pear
-
tree
,
stand
at
the
further
end
of
this
walk
,
near
my
seat
:
he
rise
up
,
dim
and
gray
,
above
the
low
shrub
round
him
.
<EOS>
now
Methusaleh
,
though
so
very
old
,
be
of
sound
timber
still
;
only
there
be
a
hole
,
or
rather
a
deep
hollow
,
near
his
root
.
<EOS>
I
know
there
be
such
a
hollow
,
hide
partly
by
ivy
and
creeper
grow
thick
round
;
and
there
I
meditate
hide
my
treasure
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
only
go
to
hide
a
treasure
 
I
mean
also
to
bury
a
grief
.
<EOS>
that
grief
over
which
I
have
lately
be
weep
,
as
I
wrap
it
in
its
winding
-
sheet
,
must
be
inter
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
I
clear
away
the
ivy
,
and
find
the
hole
;
it
be
large
enough
to
receive
the
jar
,
and
I
thrust
it
deep
in
.
<EOS>
in
a
tool
-
shed
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
,
lie
the
relic
of
building
-
material
,
leave
by
mason
lately
employ
to
repair
a
part
of
the
premise
.
<EOS>
I
fetch
thence
a
slate
and
some
mortar
,
put
the
slate
on
the
hollow
,
secure
it
with
cement
,
cover
the
hole
with
black
mould
,
and
,
finally
,
replace
the
ivy
.
<EOS>
this
do
,
I
rest
,
lean
against
the
tree
;
linger
,
like
any
other
mourner
,
beside
a
newly
-
sod
grave
.
  
<EOS>
the
air
of
the
night
be
very
still
,
but
dim
with
a
peculiar
mist
,
which
change
the
moonlight
into
a
luminous
haze
.
<EOS>
in
this
air
,
or
this
mist
,
there
be
some
quality
 
electrical
,
perhaps
 
which
act
in
strange
sort
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
feel
then
as
I
have
feel
a
year
ago
in
England
 
on
a
night
when
the
aurora
borealis
be
stream
and
sweeping
round
heaven
,
when
,
belate
in
lonely
field
,
I
have
pause
to
watch
that
muster
of
an
army
with
banner
 
<EOS>
that
quivering
of
serried
lance
 
that
swift
ascent
of
messenger
from
below
the
north
star
to
the
dark
,
high
keystone
of
heaven
's
arch
.
<EOS>
I
feel
,
not
happy
,
far
otherwise
,
but
strong
with
reinforce
strength
.
  
<EOS>
if
life
be
a
war
,
it
seem
my
destiny
to
conduct
it
single
-
handed
.
<EOS>
I
ponder
now
how
to
break
up
my
winter
-
quarter
 
to
leave
an
encampment
where
food
and
forage
fail
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
to
effect
this
change
,
another
pitch
battle
must
be
fight
with
fortune
;
if
so
,
I
have
a
mind
to
the
encounter
:
too
poor
to
lose
,
God
may
destine
me
to
gain
.
<EOS>
but
what
road
be
open
?
 
<EOS>
what
plan
available
?
  
<EOS>
on
this
question
I
be
still
pause
,
when
the
moon
,
so
dim
hitherto
,
seem
to
shine
out
somewhat
bright
:
a
ray
gleam
even
white
before
me
,
and
a
shadow
become
distinct
and
marked
.
<EOS>
I
look
more
narrowly
,
to
make
out
the
cause
of
this
well
-
define
contrast
appear
a
little
suddenly
in
the
obscure
alley
:
whiter
and
blacker
<EOS>
it
grow
on
my
eye
:
it
take
shape
with
instantaneous
transformation
.
<EOS>
I
stand
about
three
yard
from
a
tall
,
sable
-
robe
,
snowy
-
veiled
woman
.
  
<EOS>
five
minute
pass
.
<EOS>
I
neither
flee
nor
shriek
.
<EOS>
She
be
there
still
.
<EOS>
I
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
you
?
<EOS>
and
why
do
you
come
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
stand
mute
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
face
 
<EOS>
no
feature
<EOS>
:
all
below
her
brow
be
mask
with
a
white
cloth
;
but
she
have
eye
,
and
they
view
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
feel
,
if
not
brave
,
yet
a
little
desperate
;
and
desperation
will
often
suffice
to
fill
the
post
and
do
the
work
of
courage
.
<EOS>
I
advance
one
step
.
<EOS>
I
stretch
out
my
hand
,
for
I
mean
to
touch
her
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
recede
.
<EOS>
I
draw
nearer
:
her
recession
,
still
silent
,
become
swift
.
<EOS>
a
mass
of
shrub
,
full
-
leaved
evergreen
,
laurel
and
dense
yew
,
intervene
between
me
and
what
I
follow
.
<EOS>
have
pass
that
obstacle
,
I
look
and
see
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
wait
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
 
"
if
you
have
any
errand
to
man
,
come
back
and
deliver
it
.
"
<EOS>
nothing
speak
or
re
-
appeared
.
  
<EOS>
this
time
there
be
no
Dr.
John
to
whom
to
have
recourse
:
there
be
no
one
to
whom
I
dare
whisper
the
word
,
"
I
have
again

<EOS>
Paulina
Mary
seek
my
frequent
presence
in
the
Rue
Crécy
.
<EOS>
in
the
old
Bretton
day
,
though
she
have
never
profess
herself
fond
of
me
,
my
society
have
soon
become
to
her
a
sort
of
unconscious
necessary
.
<EOS>
I
use
to
notice
that
if
I
withdraw
to
my
room
,
she
would
speedily
come
trot
after
me
,
and
open
the
door
and
peep
in
,
say
,
with
her
little
peremptory
accent
,
 
"
come
down
.
<EOS>
why
do
you
sit
here
by
yourself
?
<EOS>
You
must
come
into
the
parlour
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
the
same
spirit
she
urge
me
now
 
"
leave
the
Rue
Fossette
,
"
she
say
,
"
and
come
and
live
with
us
.
<EOS>
Papa
would
give
you
far
more
than
Madame
Beck
give
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Home
himself
offer
me
a
handsome
sum
 
<EOS>
thrice
my
present
salary
 
if
I
would
accept
the
office
of
companion
to
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
I
decline
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
should
have
decline
have
I
be
poor
than
I
be
,
and
with
scanty
fund
of
resource
,
more
stinted
narrowness
of
future
prospect
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
that
vocation
.
<EOS>
I
could
teach
;
I
could
give
lesson
;
but
to
be
either
a
private
governess
or
a
companion
be
unnatural
to
me
.
<EOS>
rather
than
fill
the
former
post
in
any
great
house
,
I
would
deliberately
have
take
a
housemaid
's
place
,
buy
a
strong
pair
of
glove
,
sweep
bedroom
and
staircase
,
and
clean
stove
and
lock
,
in
peace
and
independence
.
<EOS>
rather
than
be
a
companion
,
I
would
have
make
shirt
and
starve
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
no
bright
lady
's
shadow
 
not
Miss
de
Bassompierre
's
.
<EOS>
overcast
enough
it
be
my
nature
often
to
be
;
of
a
subdued
habit
I
be
:
<EOS>
but
the
dimness
and
depression
must
both
be
voluntary
 
such
as
<EOS>
keep
me
docile
at
my
desk
,
in
the
midst
of
my
now
well
-
accustom
pupil
in
Madame
Beck
's
fist
classe
;
or
alone
,
at
my
own
bedside
,
in
her
dormitory
,
or
in
the
alley
and
seat
which
be
call
mine
,
in
her
garden
:
my
qualification
be
not
convertible
,
nor
adaptable
;
they
could
not
be
make
the
foil
of
any
gem
,
the
adjunct
of
any
beauty
,
the
appendage
of
any
greatness
in
Christendom
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
and
I
,
without
assimilate
,
understand
each
other
well
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
_
her
_
companion
,
nor
her
child
's
governess
;
she
leave
me
free
:
she
tie
me
to
nothing
 
not
to
herself
 
not
even
to
her
interest
:
<EOS>
once
,
when
she
have
for
a
fortnight
be
call
from
home
by
a
near
relation
's
illness
,
and
on
her
return
,
all
anxious
and
full
of
care
about
her
establishment
,
l
something
in
her
absence
should
have
go
wrong
finding
that
matter
have
proceed
much
as
usual
,
and
that
there
be
no
evidence
of
glare
neglect
 
<EOS>
she
make
each
of
the
teacher
a
present
,
in
acknowledgment
of
steadiness
.
<EOS>
to
my
bedside
she
come
at
twelve
o'clock
at
night
,
and
tell
me
she
have
no
present
for
me
:
"
I
must
make
fidelity
advantageous
to
the
St.
Pierre
,
"
say
she
;
"
if
I
attempt
to
make
it
advantageous
to
you
,
there
will
arise
misunderstanding
between
us
 
perhaps
separation
.
<EOS>
one
thing
,
however
,
I
_
can
_
do
to
please
you
 
<EOS>
leave
you
alone
with
your
liberty
:
c'est
-
ce
que
je
ferai
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
keep
her
word
.
<EOS>
every
slight
shackle
she
have
ever
lay
on
me
,
she
,
from
that
time
,
with
quiet
hand
remove
.
<EOS>
thus
I
have
pleasure
in
voluntarily
respect
her
rule
:
gratification
in
devote
double
time
,
in
take
double
pain
with
the
pupil
she
commit
to
my
charge
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
Mary
de
Bassompierre
,
I
visit
her
with
pleasure
,
though
I
would
not
live
with
her
.
<EOS>
My
visit
soon
teach
me
that
it
be
unlikely
<EOS>
even
my
occasional
and
voluntary
society
would
long
be
indispensable
to
her
.
<EOS>
M.
de
Bassompierre
,
for
his
part
,
seem
impervious
to
this
conjecture
,
blind
to
this
possibility
;
unconscious
as
any
child
to
the
sign
,
the
likelihood
,
the
fitful
beginning
of
what
,
when
it
draw
to
an
end
,
he
may
not
approve
.
  
<EOS>
whether
or
not
he
would
cordially
approve
,
I
use
to
speculate
.
<EOS>
difficult
to
say
.
<EOS>
He
be
much
take
up
with
scientific
interest
;
keen
,
intent
,
and
somewhat
oppugnant
in
what
concern
his
favourite
pursuit
,
but
unsuspicious
and
trustful
in
the
ordinary
affair
of
life
.
<EOS>
from
all
I
could
gather
,
he
seem
to
regard
his
"
daughterle
"
as
still
but
a
child
,
and
probably
have
not
yet
admit
the
notion
that
other
may
look
on
her
in
a
different
light
:
he
would
speak
of
what
should
be
do
when
"
Polly
"
be
a
woman
,
when
she
should
be
grow
up
;
and
"
polly
,
"
stand
beside
his
chair
,
would
sometimes
smile
and
take
his
honoured
head
between
her
little
hand
,
and
kiss
his
iron
-
grey
lock
;
and
,
at
other
time
,
she
would
pout
and
toss
her
curl
:
but
she
never
say
,
"
Papa
,
I
_
be
_
grow
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
have
different
mood
for
different
people
.
<EOS>
with
her
father
she
really
be
still
a
child
,
or
child
-
like
,
affectionate
,
merry
,
and
playful
.
<EOS>
with
me
she
be
serious
,
and
as
womanly
as
thought
and
feeling
could
make
her
.
<EOS>
with
Mrs.
Bretton
she
be
docile
and
reliant
,
but
not
expansive
.
<EOS>
with
Graham
she
be
shy
,
at
present
very
shy
;
at
moment
she
try
to
be
cold
;
on
occasion
she
endeavour
to
shun
him
.
<EOS>
His
step
make
her
start
;
his
entrance
hush
her
;
when
he
speak
,
her
answer
fail
of
fluency
;
when
he
take
leave
,
she
remain
self
-
vex
and
disconcert
.
<EOS>
even
her
father
notice
this
demeanour
in
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
little
polly
,
"
he
say
once
,
"
you
live
too
retire
a
life
;
if
you
grow
to
be
a
woman
with
these
shy
manner
,
you
will
hardly
be
fit
for
society
.
<EOS>
You
really
make
quite
a
stranger
of
Dr.
Bretton
:
how
be
this
?
<EOS>
do
not
you
remember
that
,
as
a
little
girl
,
you
use
to
be
rather
partial
to
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
Rather
_
,
papa
,
"
echo
she
,
with
her
slightly
dry
,
yet
gentle
and
simple
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
do
not
like
him
now
?
<EOS>
what
have
he
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
nothing
.
<EOS>
y
 
<EOS>
es
,
I
like
him
a
little
;
but
we
be
grow
strange
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
rub
it
off
,
Polly
;
rub
the
rust
and
the
strangeness
off
.
<EOS>
talk
away
when
he
be
here
,
and
have
no
fear
of
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
<EOS>
He
_
do
not
talk
much
.
<EOS>
be
he
afraid
of
me
,
do
you
think
,
papa
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
to
be
sure
,
what
man
would
not
be
afraid
of
such
a
little
silent
lady
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
tell
him
some
day
not
to
mind
my
be
silent
.
<EOS>
say
that
it
be
my
way
,
and
that
I
have
no
unfriendly
intention
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
way
,
you
little
chatter
-
box
?
<EOS>
so
far
from
be
your
way
,
it
be
only
your
whim
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
will
improve
,
papa
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
very
pretty
be
the
grace
with
which
,
the
next
day
,
she
try
to
keep
her
word
.
<EOS>
I
see
her
make
the
effort
to
converse
affably
with
Dr.
John
on
general
topic
.
<EOS>
the
attention
call
into
her
guest
's
face
a
pleasurable
glow
;
he
meet
her
with
caution
,
and
reply
to
her
in
his
soft
tone
,
as
if
there
be
a
kind
of
gossamer
happiness
hang
in
the
air
which
he
fear
to
disturb
by
draw
too
deep
a
breath
.
<EOS>
certainly
,
in
her
timid
yet
earnest
advance
to
friendship
,
it
could
not
be
deny
that
there
be
a
most
exquisite
and
fairy
charm
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
doctor
be
go
,
she
approach
her
father
's
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
I
keep
my
word
,
papa
?
<EOS>
do
I
behave
better
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
polly
behave
like
a
queen
.
<EOS>
I
shall
become
quite
proud
of
her
if
this
improvement
continue
.
<EOS>
by
-
and
-
by
we
shall
see
her
receive
my
guest
with
quite
a
calm
,
grand
manner

<EOS>
Miss
Lucy
and
I
will
have
to
look
about
us
,
and
polish
up
all
our
good
air
and
grace
lest
we
should
be
throw
into
the
shade
.
<EOS>
still
,
Polly
,
there
be
a
little
flutter
,
a
little
tendency
to
stammer
now
and
then
,
and
even
,
to
lisp
as
you
lisp
when
you
be
six
year
old
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
papa
,
"
interrupt
she
indignantly
,
"
that
can
not
be
true

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
appeal
to
Miss
Lucy
.
<EOS>
do
she
not
,
in
answer
Dr.
Bretton
's
question
as
to
whether
she
have
ever
see
the
palace
of
the
Prince
of
Bois
l'Etang

<EOS>
"
papa

you

you
be
méchant

<EOS>
I
can
pronounce
all
the
letter

as
clearly

you
can

<EOS>
but
tell
me
this
you
be
very
particular

me
be
civil

do
you
like
him
yourself

"
  
"
<EOS>
to
be
sure
:
for
old
acquaintance
sake
I
like
him
:
then
he
be
a
very
good
son
to
his
mother
;
besides
be
a
kind
-
hearted
fellow
and
clever
in
his
profession

yes

be
well
enough

_
Callant

ah

both

doubtless
the
Glaswegian

the
bargain

<EOS>
It
be
that
which
enable
me
to
speak
French

well

schooling

"
  
<EOS>
"
well

Polly

you
must
persuade
Miss
Snowe

undertake
both
you

make
you
steady

womanly

me
refined

<EOS>
the
light
in
which
M.

evidently
regard
"
Miss

use
to
occasion
me
much
inward
edification

what

Mr.

the

of
the
sedate

discreet
:
somewhat
conventional
,
perhaps
,
too
strict
,
limited

and
scrupulous
,
but
still
the
pink
and
pattern
of
governess
-
correctness
;
whilst
another
person
,
Professor
Paul
Emanuel

to
wit
,
never
lose
an
opportunity
of
intimate
his
opinion
that
mine

rather
a
fiery

rash
nature
 
adventurous

indocile

audacious

smile
at

<EOS>
if
any

know
me
it
be
little
Paulina
Mary

as
I
would
not
be
Paulina
's
nominal
and
pay
companion
,
genial
and
harmonious
as
I
begin
to
find
her
intercourse
,
she
persuade
me
to
join
her
in
some
study
,
as
a
regular
and
settled
mean
of
sustain
communication
:
she
propose
the
german
language
,
which
,
like
myself
,
she
find
difficult
of
mastery
.
<EOS>
We
agree
to
take
our
lesson
in
the
Rue
Crécy
of
the

mistress

this
arrangement
throw
us
together
for
some
hour
of
every

<EOS>
M.
de
Bassompierre
seem
quite
pleased
:
it
perfectly
meet
his
approbation
,
that
Madame
Minerva
Gravity
should
associate
a
portion
of
her
leisure
with
that
of
his
fair
and
dear
child

elect
judge

Rue
Fossette

discover
by
some
surreptitious
spying
mean
,
that
I
be
no
longer
so
stationary
as
hitherto
,
but
go
out
regularly
at
certain
hour
of
certain
day
,
take
it
upon
himself
to
place
me
under
surveillance
.
<EOS>
People
say
M.
Emanuel
have
be
bring
up

<EOS>
I
should
more
readily
have
accredit
this
report
have
his
manoeuvre
be
better
mask
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
I
doubt
it
.
<EOS>
never
be
a
more
undisguised
schemer
,
a
franker
,
looser
intriguer
.
<EOS>
He
would
analyze
his
own
machination
:
elaborately
contrive
plot
,
and
forthwith
indulge
in
explanatory
boast
of
their
skill
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
I
be
more
amused
or
provoke
,
by
his
step
up
to
me
one
morning
and
whisper
solemnly
that
he
"
have
his
eye
on
me
:
_
he
<EOS>
_
at

would
discharge
the
duty
of
a
friend
,
and
not
leave
me
entirely
to
my
own
device
.
<EOS>
My
,
proceeding
seem
at
present
very
unsettled
:
he
do
not
know
what
to
make
of
them
:
he
think
his
cousin
Beck
very
much
to
blame
in
suffer
this
sort
of
flutter
inconsistency
in
a
teacher
attach
to
her
house

<EOS>
what
have
a

devoted

with
Counts

<EOS>
I
say
,
"
Monsieur
exaggerate

<EOS>
I
certainly
have
enjoy
the
advantage
of
a
little
change
lately
,

not

become
necessary

recommend
me

They

ask
no

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
no
judge
of
what
expression
cross
my
face
when
he
thus
speak
,
but
it
be
one
which
provoke
him
:
he
accuse
me
of
be
reckless
,
worldly
,
and
epicurean
;
ambitious
of
greatness
,
and
feverishly
athirst
for
the
pomp
and
vanity
of
life
.
<EOS>
It
seem
I
have
no
"
dévouement
,
"
no
"
récueillement
"
in
my
character
;
no
spirit
of
grace
,
faith
,
sacrifice
,
or
self
-
abasement
.
<EOS>
feel
the
inutility
of
answer
these
charge
,
I
mutely
continue
the
correction
of
a
pile
of
english
exercise
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
could
see
in
me
nothing
Christian
:
<EOS>
like
many
other
Protestants
,
I
revel
in
the
pride
and
self

will
of
paganism
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
slightly
turn
from
him
,
nestle
still
closer
under
the
wing
of
silence
.
  
<EOS>
a
vague
sound
grumble
between
his
tooth
;
it
could
not
surely
be
a
"
juron
:
"
he
be
too
religious
for
that
;
but
I
be
certain
I
hear
the
word
_
sacré
_
.
<EOS>
grievous
to
relate
,
the

word
be
repeat

with
the
unequivocal
addition
of
_

<EOS>
_
something
,
when
I
pass
him
about
two
hour
afterwards
in
the
corridor
,
prepare
to
go
and
take
my
german
lesson
in
the
Rue
Crécy

<EOS>
never
be
a
better
little
man

in
some
point

Our
german
mistress
,
Fräulein
Anna
Braun
,
be
a
worthy
,
hearty
woman
,
of
about
forty
-
five
;
she
ought
,
perhaps
,
to
have
live
in
the
day
of
Queen
Elizabeth
,
as
she
habitually
consume
,
for
her
first
and
second
breakfast
,
beer
and
beef
:
also
,
her
direct
and
downright
Deutsch
nature
seem
to
suffer
a
sensation
of
cruel
restraint
from
what
she
call
our
English
reserve
;
though
we
think
we
be
very
cordial
with
her
:
but
we
do
not
slap
her
on
the
shoulder
,
and
if
we
consent
to
kiss
her
cheek
,
it
be
do
quietly
,
and
without
any
explosive
smack
.
<EOS>
these
omission
oppress
and
depress
her
considerably
;
still
,
on
the
whole
,
we
get
on
very
well
.
<EOS>
accustom
to
instruct
foreign
girl
,
who
hardly
ever
will
think
and
study
for
themselves
 
who
have
no
idea
of
grapple
with
a
difficulty
,
and
overcome
it
by
dint
of
reflection
or
application
 
our
progress
,
which
in
truth
be
very
leisurely
,
seem
to
astound
her
.
<EOS>
in
her
eye
,
we
be
a
pair
of
glacial
prodigy
,
cold
,
proud
,
and
preternatural
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
Countess
_
be
_
a
little
proud
,
a
little
fastidious
:
and
perhaps
,
with
her
native
delicacy
and
beauty
,
she
have
a
right
to
these
feeling
;
but
I
think
it
be
a
total
mistake
to
ascribe
them
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
never
evade
the
morning
salute
,
which
Paulina
would
slip
when
she
could
;
nor
be
a
certain
little
manner
of
still
disdain
a
weapon
know
in
my
armoury
of
defence
;
whereas
,
Paulina
always
keep
it
clear
,
fine
,
and
bright
,
and
any
rough
german
sally
call
forth
at
once
its
steelly
glisten
.
  
<EOS>
Honest
Anna
Braun
,
in
some
measure
,
feel
this
difference
;
and
while
she
half

fear
,
half
-
worship
Paulina
,
as
a
sort
of
dainty
nymph
 
<EOS>
an
Undine
 
<EOS>

refuge
with
me

as
a

of
easy
mood

<EOS>
a
book
we
like
well
to
read
and
translate
be
Schiller
's
Ballads
;
Paulina
soon
learn
to
read
them
beautifully
;
the
Fräulein
would
listen
to
her
with
a
broad
smile
of
pleasure
,
and
say
her
voice
sound
like
music
.
<EOS>
She
translate
them
,
too
,
with
a
facile
flow
of
language
,
and
in
a
strain
of
kindred
and
poetic
fervour
:
her
cheek
would
flush
,
her
lip
tremblingly
smile
,
her
beauteous
eye
kindle
or
melt
as
she
go
on
.
<EOS>
She
learn
the
good
by
heart
,
and
would
often
recite
them
when
we
be
alone
together
.
<EOS>
one
she
like
well
<EOS>
be
"
Des

"
<EOS>
that
is
,
she
like
well
to
repeat
the

find
plaintive
melody
in
the
sound

the
sense
she
would
criticise
.
<EOS>
She
murmur
,
as
we
sit
over
the

one
evening
:

<EOS>
the
Duc
de
Dindonneau
,
and
a
general
holiday
be
give
in
his
honour
at
the
school
,
and
especially
at
the
principal
"
Athénée
,
"
or
college
.
<EOS>
the
youth
of
that
institution
have
also
concoct
,
and
be
to
present
a
loyal
address
;
for
which
purpose
they
be
to
be
assemble
in
the
public
building
where
the
yearly
examination
be
conduct
,
and
the
prize
distribute
.
<EOS>
after
the
ceremony
of
presentation
,
an
oration
,
or
"
discour
,
"
be
to
follow
from
one
of
the
professor
.
  
<EOS>
several
of
M.
de
Bassompierre
's
friend
-
the
savant
-
be
more
or
less
connected
with
the
Athénée
,
they
be
expect
to
attend
on
this
occasion
;
together
with
the
worshipful
municipality
of
Villette
,
M.
le
Chevalier
Staas
,
the
burgomaster
,
and
the
parent
and
kinsfolk
of
the
Athenians
in
general
.
<EOS>
M.
de
Bassompierre
be
engage
by
his
friend
to
accompany
them
;
his
fair
daughter
would
,
of
course
,
be
of
the
party
,
and
she
write
a
little
note
to
Ginevra
and
myself
,
bid
us
come
early
that
we
may
join
her
.
  
<EOS>
as
Miss
Fanshawe
<EOS>
and
I
be
dress
in
the
dormitory
of
the
Rue
Fossette
,
<EOS>
she
(
Miss
F.
)
suddenly
burst
into
a
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
now
?
"
I
ask
;
for
she
have
suspend
the
operation
of
arrange
her
attire
,
and
be
gaze
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
seem
so
odd
,
"
she
reply
,
with
her
usual
half
-
honest
half
-
insolent
unreserve
,
"
that
you
and
I
should
now
be
so
much
on
a
level
,
visit
in
the
same
sphere
;
have
the
same
connection
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
yes
,
"
say
I
;
"
I
have
not
much
respect
for
the
connection
you
chiefly
frequent
awhile
ago
:
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
and
Co.
would
never
have
suit
me
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
who
_
be
_
you
,
Miss
Snowe
?
<EOS>
"
she
inquire
,
in
a
tone
of
such
undisguised
and
unsophisticated
curiosity
,
as
make
me
laugh
in
my
turn
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
use
to
call
yourself
a
nursery
governess
;
when
you
first
come
here
you
really
have
the
care
of
the
child
in
this
house
:
I
have
see
you
carry
little
Georgette
in
your
arm
,
like
a
bonne
 
few

have
condescend
so
far
 
and
now
Madame
Beck
treat
you
with
more
courtesy

treat

proud
chit

make
you
her
bosom
friend
!

<EOS>
"
wonderful
!
<EOS>
"
I
agree
,
much
amuse
at
her
mystification
.
<EOS>
"
who
be
I
indeed
?
<EOS>
perhaps
a
personage
in
disguise
.
<EOS>

I
do
not
look
the
character

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
you
be
not
more
flattered
by
all
this
,
"
she
go
on
;
"
you
take
it
with
strange
composure
.
<EOS>
if
you
really
be
the
nobody
I
once
think
you

you
must
be
a
cool
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
the
nobody
you
once
think
me
!
"
<EOS>
I
repeat
,
and
my
face
grow
a
little
hot
;
but
I
would
not
be
angry
:
of
what
importance
be
a
school
-
girl
's
crude
use
of
the
term
nobody
and
somebody
?
<EOS>
I
confine
myself
,
therefore
,
to
the
remark
that
I
have
merely
meet
with
civility
;
and
ask
"
what
she
see
in
civility
to
throw
the
recipient
into
a
fever
of
confusion
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
one
can
not
help
wonder
at
some

wonder
at
marvel

you
ready
at
last

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

let
me
take
your

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
not

we

walk
side

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
she
take
my
arm
,
she
always
lean
upon
me
her
whole
weight
;
and
,
as
I
be
not
a

I
do
not

it

<EOS>
"
there
,
again
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
cry
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
by
offer
to
take
your
arm
,
to
intimate
approbation
of
your
dress
and
general
appearance
:
I
mean
it
as
a
compliment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
?
<EOS>
You
mean
,
in
short
,
to
express
that
you
be
not
ashamed
to
be
see
in
the
street
with
me
?
<EOS>
that
if
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
should
be
fondle
her
lapdog
at
some
window
,
or
Colonel
de
Hamal
pick
his
tooth
in

and
should

you
would
not

blush
for
your

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

"
say
she
,
with
that
directness
which
be
her
good
point
 
which
give
an
honest
plainness
to
her
very
fibs
when
she
tell
them
 
which

in

,
the
salt
,
the
sole
preservative
ingredient
of
a
character
otherwise
not
form

keep

<EOS>
I
delegate
the
trouble
of
comment
on
this
"
yes
"
to
my
countenance
;
or
rather
,
my
under

lip
voluntarily
anticipate
my
tongue

course

reverence

solemnity

feeling

look
I
give
her

<EOS>
"
scornful

sneer
creature

she
go
on
,
as
we
cross
a
great
square
,
and
enter
the
quiet
,
pleasant
park
,
our
near
way
to
the
Rue
Crécy
.
<EOS>
"
nobody

<EOS>

You

alone

good

persevere
she
,
push
her
hand
,
in
spite
of
me
,
under
my
arm
;
and
that
arm
press
itself
with
inhospitable
closeness
against
my
side

by
way
of
keep
out
the
intruder
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
say
,
"
I
be
a
rise
character
:
once
an
old
lady
's
companion
,
then
a
nursery
-
governess
,
now
a
school
-
teacher
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
 
_
do
_
tell
me
who
you
be
?
<EOS>
I
will
not
repeat
it
,
"
she
urge
,
adhere
with
ludicrous
tenacity
to
the
wise
notion
of
an
incognito
she
have
get
hold
of
;
and
she
squeeze
the
arm
of
which
she
have
now
obtain
full
possession
,
and
coaxed
and
conjure
till
I
be
oblige
to
pause
in
the
park
to
laugh
.
<EOS>
throughout
our
walk
she
ring
the
most
fanciful
change
on
this
theme
;
prove
,
by
her
obstinate
credulity
,
or
incredulity
,
her
incapacity
to
conceive
how
any
person
not
bolster
up
by
birth
or
wealth
,
not
support
by
some
consciousness
of
name
or
connection
,
could
maintain
an
attitude
of
reasonable
integrity
.
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
it
quite
suffice
to
my
mental
tranquillity
that
I
be
know
where
it
import
that
know
I
should
be
;
the
rest
sit
on
me
easily
:
pedigree
,
social
position
,
and
recondite
intellectual
acquisition
,
occupy
about
the
same
space
and
place
in
my
interest
and
thought
;
they
be
my
third
-
class
lodger
 
to
whom
could
be
assign
only
the
small
sitting
-
room
and
the
little
back
bedroom
:
even
if
the
dining
and
drawing
-
room
stand
empty
,
I
never
confess
it
to
them
,
as
think
minor
accommodation
better
suit
to
their
circumstance
.
<EOS>
the
world
,
I
soon
learn
,
hold
a
different
estimate
:
and
I
make
no
doubt
,
the
world
be
very
right
in
its
view
,
yet
believe
also
that
I
be
not
quite
wrong
in
mine
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
people
whom
a
lower
position
degrade
morally
,
to
whom
loss
of
connection
cost
loss
of
self
-
respect
:
be
not
these
justify
in
place
the
high
value
on
that
station
and
association
which
be
their
safeguard
from
debasement
?
<EOS>
if
a
man
feel
that
he
would
become
contemptible
in
his
own
eye
be
it
generally
know
that
his
ancestry
be
simple
and
not
gentle
,
poor
and
not
rich
,
worker
and
not
capitalist
,
would
it
be
right
severely
to
blame
him
for
keep
these
fatal
fact
out
of
sight
 
for
start
,
tremble
,
quail
at
the
chance
which
threaten
exposure
?
<EOS>
the
longer
we
live
,
the
more
out
experience
widen
;
the
less
prone
be
we
to
judge
our
neighbour
's
conduct
,
to
question
the
world
's
wisdom
:
wherever
an
accumulation
of
small
defence
be
find
,
whether
surround
the
prude
's
virtue
or
the
man
of
the
world
's
respectability
,
there
,
be
sure
,
it
be
need
.
  
<EOS>
We
reach
the
Hôtel
Crécy
;
Paulina
be
ready
;
Mrs.
Bretton
be
with
her
;
and
,
under
her
escort
and
that
of
M.
de
Bassompierre
,
we
be
soon
conduct
to
the
place
of
assembly
,
and
seat
in
good
seat
,
at
a
convenient
distance
from
the
Tribune
.
<EOS>
the
youth
of
the
Athénée
be
marshal
before
us
,
the
municipality
and
their
bourgmestre
be
in
place
of
honour
,
the
young
prince
,
with
their
tutor
,
occupy
a
conspicuous
position
,
and
the
body
of
the
building
be
crowd
with
the
aristocracy
and
first
burgher
of
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
concern
the
identity
of
the
professor
by
whom
the
"
discours
"
be
to
be
deliver
,
I
have
as
yet
entertain
neither
care
nor
question
.
<EOS>
some
vague
expectation
I
have
that
a
savant
would
stand
up
and
deliver
a
formal
speech
,
half
dogmatism
to
the
Athenians
,
half
flattery
to
the
prince
.
  
<EOS>
the
Tribune
be
yet
empty
when
we
enter
,
but
in
ten
minute
after
it
be
fill
;
suddenly
,
in
a
second
of
time
,
a
head
,
chest
,
and
arm
grow
above
the
crimson
desk
.
<EOS>
this
head
I
know
:
its
colour
,
shape
,
port
,
expression
,
be
familiar
both
to
me
and
Miss
Fanshawe
;
the
blackness
and
closeness
of
cranium
,
the
amplitude
and
paleness
of
brow
,
the
blueness
and
fire
of
glance
,
be
detail
so
domesticate
in
the
memory
,
and
so
knit
with
many
a
whimsical
association
,
as
almost
by
this
their
sudden
apparition
,
to
tickle
fancy
to
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
confess
,
for
my
part
,
I
do
laugh
till
I
be
warm
;
but
then
I
bend
my
head
,
and
make
my
handkerchief
and
a
lower
veil
the
sole
confidant
of
my
mirth
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
I
be
glad
to
see
M.
Paul
;
I
think
it
be
rather
pleasant
than
otherwise
,
to
behold
him
set
up
there
,
fierce
and
frank
,
dark
and
candid
,
testy
and
fearless
,
as
when
regnant
on
his
estrade
in
class
.
<EOS>
His
presence
be
such
a
surprise
:
I
have
not
once
think
of
expect
him
,
though
I
know
he
fill
the
chair
of
Belles
Lettres
in
the
college
.
<EOS>
with
_
him
_
in
that
Tribune
,
I
feel
sure
that
neither
formalism
nor
flattery
would
be
our
doom
;
but
for
what
be
vouchsafe
us
,
for
what
be
pour
suddenly
,
rapidly
,
continuously
,
on
our
head
 
I
own
I
be
not
prepared
.
  
<EOS>
He
speak
to
the
prince
,
the
noble
,
the
magistrate
,
and
the
burgher
,
with
just
the
same
ease
,
with
almost
the
same
pointed
,
choleric
earnestness
,
with
which
he
be
will
not
to
harangue
the
three
division
of
the
Rue
Fossette
.
<EOS>
the
collegian
he
address
,
not
as
schoolboy
,
but
as
future
citizen
and
embryo
patriot
.
<EOS>
the
time
which
have
since
come
on
Europe
have
not
be
foretold
yet
,
and
M.
Emanuel
's
spirit
seem
new
to
me
.
<EOS>
who
would
have
think
the
flat
and
fat
soil
of
Labassecour
could
yield
political
conviction
and
national
feeling
,
such
as
be
now
strongly
express
?
<EOS>
of
the
bearing
of
his
opinion
I
need
here
give
no
special
indication
;
yet
it
may
be
permit
me
to
say
that
I
believe
the
little
man
not
more
earnest
than
right
in
what
he
say
:
with
all
his
fire
he
be
severe
and
sensible
;
he
trample
utopian
theory
under
his
heel
;
he
reject
wild
dream
with
scorn
;
 
but
when
he
look
in
the
face
of
tyranny
 
<EOS>
oh
,
then
there
open
a
light
in
his
eye
worth
see
;
and
when
he
speak
of
injustice
,
his
voice
give
no
uncertain
sound
,
but
remind
me
rather
of
the
band
-
trumpet
,
ring
at
twilight
from
the
park
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
his
audience
be
generally
susceptible
of
share
his
flame
in
its
purity
;
but
some
of
the
college
youth
catch
fire
as
he
eloquently
tell
them
what
should
be
their
path
and
endeavour
in
their
country
's
and
in
Europe
's
future
.
<EOS>
They
give
him
a
long
,
loud
,
ring
cheer
,
as
he
conclude
:
with
all
his
fierceness
,
he
be
their
favourite
professor
.
  
<EOS>
as
our
party
leave
the
Hall
,
he
stand
at
the
entrance
;
he
see
and
know
me
,
and
lift
his
hat
;
he
offer
his
hand
in
passing
,
and
utter
the
word
"
qu'en
dite
vous
?
"
 
<EOS>
question
eminently
characteristic
,
and
remind
me
,
even
in
this
his
moment
of
triumph
,
of
that
inquisitive
restlessness
,
that
absence
of
what
I
consider
desirable
self
-
control
,
which
be
amongst
his
fault
.
<EOS>
He
should
not
have
care
just
then
to
ask
what
I
think
,
or
what
anybody
think
,
but
he
_
do
_
care
,
and
he
be
too
natural
to
conceal
,
too
impulsive
to
repress
his
wish
.
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
if
I
blame
his
over
-
eagerness
,
I
like
his
_
naiveté
_
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
praise
him
:
I
have
plenty
of
praise
in
my
heart
;
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
no
word
on
my
lip
.
<EOS>
who
_
have
_
word
at
the
right
moment
?
<EOS>
I
stammer
some
lame
expression
;
but
be
truly
glad
when
other
people
,
come
up

a

introduce
him
to
M.
de
Bassompierre
;
and
the
Count

who
have
likewise
be
highly
gratify
,
ask
him
to
join
his
friend
(
for
the
most
part
M.
Emanuel
be
likewise
)
,
and
to
dine
with
them
at
the
Hôtel
Crécy
.
<EOS>
He
decline
dinner
,
for
he
be
a
man
always
somewhat
shy
at
meet
the
advance
of
the
wealthy
:
there
be
a
strength
of
sturdy
independence
in
the
stringing
of
his
sinew
 
not
obtrusive
,
but
pleasant
enough
to
discover
as
one
advanced
in
knowledge
of
his
character
;
he
promise
,
however
,
to
step
in
with
his
friend
,
M.
A
 
,
a
French
Academician
,
in
the
course
of
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
at
dinner
that
day
,
Ginevra
and
Paulina
each
look
,
in
her
own
way
,
very
beautiful
;
<EOS>
the
former
,
perhaps
,
boast
the
advantage
in
material
charm
,
but
the
latter
shone
pre
-
eminent
for
attraction
more
subtle
and
spiritual
:
for
light
and
eloquence
of
eye
,
for
grace
of
mien
,
for
win
variety
of
expression
.
<EOS>
Ginevra
's
dress
of
deep
crimson
relieve
well
her
light
curl
,
and
harmonize
with
her
rise
-
like
bloom
.
<EOS>
Paulina
's
attire
 
in
fashion
close
,
though
faultlessly
neat
,
but
in
texture
clear
and
white
 
make
the
eye
grateful
for
the
delicate
life
of
her
complexion
,
for
the
soft
animation
of
her
countenance
,
for
the
tender
depth
of
her
eye
,
for
the
brown
shadow
and
bounteous
flow
of
her
hair
 
dark
than
that
of
her
Saxon
cousin

be
also

eyebrow
,

eyelash
,
her
full
irid

and
large
mobile
pupil

<EOS>
nature
have
trace
all
these
detail
slightly
,
and
with
a
careless
hand
,
in
Miss
Fanshawe
's
case
;
and
in
Miss
de
Bassompierre
's
,
work
them
to
a
high
and
delicate
finish
.
  
<EOS>
Paulina
be
awe
by
the
savant
,
but
not
quite
to
mutism
:
she
converse
modestly
,
diffidently
;
not
without
effort
,
but
with
so
true
a
sweetness
,
so
fine
and
penetrate
a
sense
,
that
her
father
more
than
once
suspend
his
own
discourse
to
listen
,
and
fix
on
her
an
eye
of
proud
delight
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
polite
Frenchman
,
M.
Z
 
,
a
very
learned
,
but
quite
a
courtly
man
,
who
have
draw
her
into
discourse
.
<EOS>
I
be
charm
with
her
French
;
it
be
faultless
 
<EOS>
the
structure
correct
,
the
idiom
true
,
the
accent
pure
;
Ginevra
,
who
have
live
half
her
life
on
the
continent
,
could
do
nothing
like
it
not
that
word
ever
fail
Miss
Fanshawe
,
but
real
accuracy
and
purity
<EOS>
she
neither
possess
,
nor
in
any
number
of
year
would
acquire
.
<EOS>
here
,
too
,
M.
de
Bassompierre
be
gratify
;
for
,
on
the
point
of
language
,
he
be
critical
.
  
<EOS>
another
listener
and
observer
there
be
;
one
who
,
detain
by
some
exigency
of
his
profession
,
have
come
in
late
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
both
lady
be
quietly
scan
by
Dr.
Bretton
,
at
the
moment
of
take
his
seat
at
the
table
;
and
that
guard
survey
be
more
than
once
renew
.
<EOS>
His
arrival
rouse
Miss
Fanshawe
,
who
have
hitherto
appear
listless
:
she
now
become
smile
and
complacent
,
talk
 
though
what
she
say
be
rarely
to
the
purpose
 
or
rather
,
be
of
a
purpose
somewhat
mortifyingly
below
the
standard
of
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
Her
light
,
disconnected
prattle
may
have
gratify
Graham
once
;
perhaps
it
please
him
still
<EOS>
:
perhaps
it
be
only
fancy
which
suggest
the
thought
that
,
while
his
eye
be
fill
and
his
ear
feed
,
his
taste
,
his
keen
zest
,
his
lively
intelligence
,
be
not
equally
consult
and
regale
.
<EOS>
It
be
certain
that
,
restless
and
exact
as
seem
the
demand
on
his
attention
,
he
yield
courteously
all
that
be
require
:
his
manner
show
neither
pique
nor
coolness
:
<EOS>
Ginevra
be
his
neighbour
,
and
to
her
,
during
dinner
,
he
almost
exclusively
confine
his
notice
.
<EOS>
She
appear
satisfied
,
and
pass
to
the
drawing
-
room
in
very
good
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
yet
,
no
sooner
have
we
reach
that
place
of
refuge
,
than
she
again
become
flat
and
listless
:
throw
herself
on
a
couch
,
she
denounce
both
the
"
discour
"
and
the
dinner
as
stupid
affair
,
and
inquire
of
her
cousin
how
she
could
hear
such
a
set
of
prosaic
"
gro
-
bonnet
"
as
her
father
gather
about
him
.
<EOS>
the
moment
the
gentleman
be
hear
to
move
,
her
railing
cease
:
she
start
up
,
fly
to
the
piano
,
and
dash
at
it
with
spirit
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Bretton
enter
,
one
of
the
first
,
take
up
his
station
beside
her
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
would
not
long
maintain
that
post
:
there
be
a
position
near
the
hearth
to
which
I
expect
to
see
him
attract
:
this
position
he
only
scan
with
his
eye
;
while
_
he
_
look
,
other
draw
in
.
<EOS>
the
grace
and
mind
of
Paulina
charm
these
thoughtful
frenchman
:
the
fineness
of
her
beauty
,
the
soft
courtesy
of
her
manner
,
her
immature
,
but
real
and
inbreed
tact
,
please
their
national
taste
;
they
cluster
about
her
,
not
indeed
to
talk
science
;
which
would
have
render
her
dumb
,
but
to
touch
on
many
subject
in
letter
,
in
art
,
in
actual
life
,
on
which
it
soon
appear
that
she
have
both
read
and
reflect
.
<EOS>
I
listen
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
that
though
Graham
stand
aloof
,
he
listen
too
:
<EOS>
his
hearing
as
well
as
his
vision
be
very
fine
,
quick
,
discriminate
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
gather
the
conversation
;
I
feel
that
the
mode
in
which
it
be
sustain
suit
him
exquisitely
 
please
him
almost
to
pain
.
  
<EOS>
in
Paulina
there
be
more
force
,
both
of
feeling
and
character
;
than
most
people
think
 
than
Graham
himself
imagine
 
than
she
would
ever
show
to
those
who
do
not
wish
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
to
speak
truth
,
reader
,
there
be
no
excellent
beauty
,
no
accomplished
grace
,
no
reliable
refinement
,
without
strength
as
excellent
,
as
complete
,
as
trustworthy
.
<EOS>
as
well
may
you
look
for
good
fruit
and
blossom
on
a
rootless
and
sapless
tree
,
as
for
charm
that
will
endure
in
a
feeble
and
relaxed
nature
.
<EOS>
for
a
little
while
,
the
bloom
semblance
of
beauty
may
flourish
round
weakness
;
but
it
can
not
bear
a
blast
<EOS>
:
it
soon
fade
,
even
in
serene
sunshine
.
<EOS>
Graham
would
have
start
have
any
suggestive
spirit
whisper
of
the
sinew
and
the
stamina
sustain
that
delicate
nature
;
but
I
who
have
know
her
as
a
child
,
know
or
guess
by
what
a
good
and
strong
root
her
grace
hold
to
the
firm
soil
of
reality
.
  
<EOS>
while
Dr.
Bretton
listen
,
and
wait
an
opening
in
the
magic
circle
,
his
glance
restlessly
sweep
the
room
at
interval
,
light
by
chance
on
me
,
where
I
sit
in
a
quiet
nook
not
far
from
my
godmother
and
M.
de
Bassompierre
,
who
,
as
usual
,
be
engage
in
what
Mr.
Home
call
"
a
two
-
handed
crack
:
"
what
the
Count
would
have
interpret
as
a
tête
-
à

tête
.
<EOS>
Graham
smile
recognition
,
cross
the
room
,
ask
me
how
I
be
,
tell
me
I
look
pale
.
<EOS>
I
also
have
my
own
smile
at
my
own
thought
:
it
be
now
about
three
month
since
Dr.
John
have
speak
to
me
-
a
lapse
of
which
he
be
not
even
conscious
.
<EOS>
He
sit
down
,
and
become
silent
.
<EOS>
His
wish
be
rather
to
look
than
converse
.
<EOS>
Ginevra
and
Paulina
be
now
opposite
to
him
:
he
could
gaze
his
fill
:
he
survey
both
form
 
study
both
face
.
  
<EOS>
several
new
guest
,
lady
as
well
as
gentleman
,
have
enter
the
room
since
dinner
,
drop
in
for
the
evening
conversation
;
and
amongst
the
gentleman
,
I
may
incidentally
observe
,
<EOS>
I
have
already
notice
by
glimpse
,
a
severe
,
dark
,
professorial
outline
,
hover
aloof
in
an
inner
saloon
,
see
only
in
vista
.
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
know
many
of
the
gentleman
present
,
but
I
think
be
a
stranger
to
most
of
the
lady
,
except
myself
;
in
look
towards
the
hearth
,
he
could
not
but
see
me
,
and
naturally
make
a
movement
to
approach
;
see
,
however
,
Dr.
Bretton
also
,
he
change
his
mind
and
hold
back
.
<EOS>
if
that
have
be
all
,
there
would
have
be
no
cause
for
quarrel
;
but
not
satisfied
with
hold
back
,
he
pucker
up
his
eyebrow
,
protrude
his
lip
,
and
look
so
ugly
that
I
avert
my
eye
from
the
displease
spectacle
.
<EOS>
M.
Joseph
Emanuel
have
arrive
,
as
well
as
his
austere
brother
,
and
at
this
very
moment
be
relieve
Ginevra
at
the
piano
.
<EOS>
what
a
master
-
touch
succeed
her
school
-
girl
jingle
!
<EOS>
in
what
grand
,
grateful
tone
the
instrument
acknowledge
the
hand
of
the
true
artist
!
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
,
"
begin
Dr.
Bretton
,
break
silence
and
smile
,
as
Ginevra
glide
before
him
,
cast
a
glance
as
she
pass
by
,
"
Miss
Fanshawe
be
certainly
a
fine
girl
.
"
  
<EOS>
of
course
I
assent

there

,
"
another
in

<EOS>

I
think
there
be
not
another
as
handsome

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
agree
with
you
,
Lucy
:
<EOS>
you
and
I
do
often
agree
in
opinion
,
in
taste

I
think
;
or
at
least
in
judgment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
we
?
"
<EOS>
I
say
,
somewhat
doubtfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
if
you
have
be
a
boy
,
Lucy
,
instead
of
a
girl
 
my
mother
's
god
-
son
instead
of
her
god
-
daughter
,
we
should
have
be
good
friend
:
our
opinion
would
have
melt
into
each
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
assume
a
bantering
air
:
a
light
,
half
-
caress
,
half
-
ironic
,
shine
aslant
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
ah
,
Graham
!
<EOS>
I
have
give
more
than
one
solitary
moment
to
thought
and
calculation
of
your
estimate
of
Lucy
Snowe
:
be
it
always
kind
or
just
?
<EOS>
have
Lucy
be
intrinsically
the
same
but
possess
the
additional
advantage
of
wealth
and
station
,
would
your
manner
to
her
,
your
value
for
her
,
have
be
quite
what
they
actually
be
?
<EOS>
and
yet
by
these
question
I
would
not
seriously
infer
blame
.
<EOS>
no
;
you
may
sadden
and
trouble
me
sometimes
;
but
then
mine
be
a
soon
-
depress
,
an
easily
-
derange
temperament
 
<EOS>
it
fall
if
a
cloud
cross
the
sun
.
<EOS>
perhaps
before
the
eye
of
severe
equity
I
should
stand
more
at
fault
than
you
.
  
<EOS>
Trying
,
then
,
to
keep
down
the
unreasonable
pain
which
thrill
my
heart
,
on
thus
be
make
to
feel
that
while
Graham
could
devote
to
other
the
most
grave
and
earnest
,
the
manly
interest
,
he
have
no
more
than
light
raillery
for
Lucy
,
the
friend
of
lang
syne
,
I
inquire
calmly
,
 
"
<EOS>
on
what
point
be
we
so
closely
in
accordance
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
each
have
an
observant
faculty
.
<EOS>
You
,
perhaps
,
do
not
give
me
credit
for
the
possession
;
yet
I
have
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
be
speak
of
taste
:
we
may
see
the

object
,
yet
estimate
them
differently
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
us
bring
it
to
the
test

<EOS>
of
course
,
you
can
not

render
homage
to
the
merit
of
Miss
Fanshawe

now
,
what
do
you
think
of
other
in

<EOS>
my

for
instance
;

give

Dr.

not

with

welcome
force

always

teach
him
well
never

soubrette

on
till

could
bear
no

my
eye
fill

<EOS>
suddenly
he
be
sober
:
a
vacant
space
appear
near
Miss
de
Bassompierre
;
the
circle
surround
her
seem
about
to
dissolve
.
<EOS>
this
movement
be
instantly
catch
by
Graham
's
eye
 
ever
-
vigilant
,
even
while
laugh
;
he
rise
,
take
his
courage
in
both
hand

cross
the
room
,
and
make
the
advantage
his
own

<EOS>
Dr.

,
throughout

life
,
be
a
man
of
luck
 
<EOS>
a
man
of
success

<EOS>
and
why
?
<EOS>
because
he
have
the
eye
to
see
his
opportunity
,
the
heart
to
prompt
to
well
-
time
action
,
the
nerve
to
consummate
a
perfect
work
.
<EOS>
and
no
tyrant
-
passion
drag
him
back
;
no
enthusiasm
,
no
foible
encumber
his
way
.
<EOS>
how
well
he
look
at
this
very
moment
!
<EOS>
when
Paulina
look
up
as
he
reach
her
side
,
her
glance
mingle
at
once
with
an
encounter
glance
,
animate
,
yet
modest
;
his
colour
,
as
he
speak
to
her
,
become
half
a
blush
,
half
a
glow
.
<EOS>
He
stand
in
her
presence
brave
and
bashful
:
subdued
and
unobtrusive
,
yet
decide
in
his
purpose
and
devote
in
his
ardour
.
<EOS>
I
gather
all
this
by
one
view
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
prolong
my
observation
 
time
fail
me
,
have
inclination
serve
:
<EOS>
the
night
wear
late
;
Ginevra
and
I
ought
already
to
have
be
in
the
Rue
Fossette
.
<EOS>
I
rise
,
and
bade
good
-
night
to
my
godmother
and
M.
de
Bassompierre
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
Professor
Emanuel
have
notice
my
reluctant
acceptance
of
Dr.
Bretton
's
badinage
,
or
whether
he
perceive
that
I
be
pain
,
and
that
,
on
the
whole
,
the
evening
have
not
be
one
flow
of
exultant
enjoyment
for
the
volatile
,
pleasure
-
love
Mademoiselle
Lucie
;
but
,
as
I
be
leave
the
room
,
he
step
up
and
inquire
whether
I
have
any
one
to
attend
me
to
the
Rue
Fossette
.
<EOS>
the
professor
_
now
_
speak
politely
,
and
even
deferentially
,
and
he
look
apologetic
and
repentant
;
but
I
could
not
recognise
his
civility
at
a
word
,
nor
meet
his
contrition
with
crude
,
premature
oblivion
.
<EOS>
never
hitherto
have
<EOS>
I
feel
seriously
disposed
to
resent
his
brusquerie
,
or
freeze
before
his
fierceness
;
what
he
have
say
to
-
night
<EOS>
,
however
,
I
consider
unwarranted
:
my
extreme
disapprobation
of
the
proceeding
must
be
mark
,
however
slightly
.
<EOS>
I
merely
say
:
 
"
I
be
provide
with
attendance
.
"
  
<EOS>
which
be
true
,
as
Ginevra
and
I
be
to
be
send
home
in
the
carriage
;
and
I
pass
him
with
the
slide
obeisance
with
which
he
be
will
not
to
be
salute
in
classe
by
pupil
cross
his
estrade
.
  
<EOS>
have
seek
my
shawl
,
I
return
to
the
vestibule
.
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
stand
there
as
if
wait
.
<EOS>
He
observe
that
the
night
be
fine
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
with
a
tone
and
manner
whose
consummate
chariness
and
frostiness
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
applaud
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
seldom
<EOS>
I
could
properly
act
out
my
own
resolution
to
be
reserve
and
cool
where
I
have
be
grieve
or
hurt
,
that
I
feel
almost
proud
of
this
one
successful
effort
.
<EOS>
that
"
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
sound
just
like
the
manner
of
other
people
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
hundred
of
such
little
mince
,
dock
,
dry
phrase
,
from
the
purse
-
up
coral
lip
of
a
score
of
self
-
possess
,
self
-
suffice
miss
and
mademoiselle
.
<EOS>
that
M.
Paul
would
not
stand
any
prolonged
experience
of
this
sort
of
dialogue
I
know
;
but
he
certainly
merit
a
sample
of
the
curt
and
arid
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
think
so
himself
,
for
he
take
the
dose
quietly
.
<EOS>
He
look
at
my
shawl
and
object
to
its
lightness
.
<EOS>
I
decidedly
tell
him
it
be
as
heavy
as
I
wish
.
<EOS>
recede
aloof
,
and
stand
apart
,
I
lean
on
the
banister
of
the
stair
,
fold
my
shawl
about
me
,
and
fix
my
eye
on
a
dreary
religious
painting
darken
the
wall
.
  
<EOS>
Ginevra
be
long
in
come
:
tedious
seem
her
loitering
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
be
still
there
;
my
ear
expect
from
his
lip
an
angry
tone
.
<EOS>
He
come
nearer
.
"
<EOS>
now
for
another
hiss
!
"
<EOS>
think
I
:
have
not
the
action
be
too
uncivil
<EOS>
I
could
have
,
stop
my
ear
with
my
finger
in
terror
of
the
thrill
.
<EOS>
nothing
happen
as
we
expect
:
listen
for
a
coo
or
a
murmur
;
it
be
then
you
will
hear
a
cry
of
prey
or
pain
.
<EOS>
await
a
piercing
shriek
,
an
angry
threat
,
and
welcome
an
amicable
greeting
,
a
low
kind
whisper
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
speak
gently
:
 
"
Friends
,
"
say
he
,
"
do
not
quarrel
for
a
word
.
<EOS>
tell
me
,
be
it
I
or
ce
grand
fat
d'Anglais

<EOS>
(
so
he
profanely
denominate
Dr.
Bretton
)
,
"
who
make
your
eye
so
humid
,
and
your
cheek
so
hot
as
they

even
now

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
conscious
of
you
,
monsieur
,
or
of
any
other
have
excite
such
emotion
as
you
indicate
,
"
be
my
answer
;
and
in
give
it
,
I
again
surpass
my
usual
self
,
and
achieve
a
neat
,
frosty
falsehood
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
what
do
I
say
?
<EOS>
"
he
pursue
;
"
tell
me
:
<EOS>
I
be
angry
:
I
have
forget
my
word
;
what
be
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
such
as
it
be
good
to
forget
!
"
say
I
,
still
quite
calm
and
chill
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
it
be
_
<EOS>
my
_
word
which
wound
you
?
<EOS>
consider
them
unsaid
:
permit
my
retractation
;
accord
my
pardon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
angry
,
Monsieur

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
be
bad
than
angry
 
grieved

<EOS>
forgive
me
,
Miss
Lucy

"
  
<EOS>
"
M.
Emanuel
,
I
_
do

forgive
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
hear
you
say
,
in
the
voice
natural
to
you

and
not
in
that
alien
tone

Mon

<EOS>
He
make
me
smile

could
help
smile
at
his
wistfulness

his
simplicity

his
earnestness

another

my

"
  
<EOS>
now
,
"
my
friend

have
rather
another
sound
and
significancy
than
"
_
mon
ami

;
"
it
do
not
breathe
the
same
sense
of
domestic
and
intimate
affection
;
"
_
mon
ami
_
<EOS>
"
I
could
_
not
_
say
to
M.
Paul
;
"
my
friend

"
I
could
,
and
do
say
without
difficulty
.
<EOS>
this
distinction
exist
not
for
him
,
however
,
and
he
be
quite
satisfied
with
the
english
phrase
.
<EOS>
He
smile
.
<EOS>
You
should
have
see
him
smile
,
reader
;
and
you
should
have
mark
the
difference
between
his
countenance
now
,
and
that
he
wear
half
an
hour
ago
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
affirm
that
I
have
ever
witness
the
smile
of
pleasure
,
or
content
,
or
kindness
round
M.
Paul
's
lip
,
or
in
his
eye
before
.
<EOS>
the
ironic
,
the
sarcastic
,
the
disdainful
,
the
passionately
exultant
<EOS>
,
I
have
hundred
of
time
see
him
express
by
what
he
call
a
smile
,
but
any
illuminate
sign
of
milder
or
warm
feeling
strike
me
as
wholly
new
in
his
visage
.
<EOS>
It
change
it
as
from
a
mask
to
a
face
:
the
deep
line
leave
his
feature
;
the
very
complexion
seem
clear
and
fresher
;
that
swart
,
sallow
,
southern
darkness
which
speak
his
spanish
blood
,
become
displace
by
a
light
hue
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
that
I
have
ever
see
in
any
other
human
face
an
equal
metamorphosis
from
a
similar
cause
.
<EOS>
He
now
take
me
to
the
carriage
:
at
the
same
moment
M.
de
Bassompierre
come
out
with
his
niece
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
pretty
humour
be
Mistress
Fanshawe
;
she
have
find
the
evening
a
grand
failure
:
completely
upset
as
to
temper
,
she
give
way
to
the
most
uncontrolled
moroseness
as
soon
as
we
be
seat
,
and
the
carriage
-
door
close
.
<EOS>
Her
invective
against
Dr.
Bretton
have
something
venomous
in
them
.
<EOS>
have
find
herself
impotent
either
to
charm
or
ste
him
,
hatred
be
her
only
resource
;
and
this
hatred
she
express
in
term
so
unmeasured
and
proportion
so
monstrous
,
<EOS>
that
,
after
listen
for
a
while
with
assumed
stoicism
,
my
outraged
sense
of
justice
at
last
and
suddenly
catch
fire
.
<EOS>
an
explosion
ensue
:
for
I
could
be
passionate
,
too
;
especially
with
my
present
fair
but
faulty
associate
,
who
never
fail
to
stir
the
bad
dreg
of
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
that
the
carriage
-
wheel
make
a
tremendous
rattle
over
the
flinty
Choseville
pavement
,
for
I
can
assure
the
reader
there
be
neither
dead
silence
nor
calm
discussion
within
the
vehicle
.
<EOS>
half
in
earnest
,
half
in
seeming
,
I
make
it
my
business
to
storm
down
Ginevra
.
<EOS>
She
have
set
out
rampant
from
the
Rue
Crécy
;
it
be
necessary
to
tame
her
before
we
reach
the
Rue
Fossette
:
to
this
end
it
be
indispensable
to
show
up
her
sterling
value
and
high
desert
;
and
this
must
be
do
in
language
of
which
the
fidelity
and
homeliness
may
challenge
comparison
with
the
compliment
of
a
John
Knox
to
a
Mary
Stuart
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
right
discipline
for
Ginevra
;
it
suit
her
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
sure
she
go
to
bed
that
night
all
the
well
and
more
settle
in
mind
and
mood
,
and
sleep
all
the
more
sweetly
for
have
undergo
a
sound
moral
drubbing
.
    
<EOS>
the
WATCHGUARD

<EOS>
M.
Paul
Emanuel
own
an
acute
sensitiveness
to
the
annoyance
of
interruption
,
from
whatsoever
cause
occur
,
during
his
lesson
:
to
pass
through
the
classe
under
such
circumstance
be
consider
by
the
teacher
and
pupil
of
the
school
,
individually
and
collectively
,
to
be
as
much
as
a
woman
's
or
girl
's
life
be
worth
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
herself
,
if
force
to
the
enterprise
,
would
"
skurry
"
through
,
retrench
her
skirt
,
and
carefully
coast
the
formidable
estrade
,
like
a

dread
breaker

<EOS>
as

devolve
the
fearful
duty
of
fetching
pupil
out
of
the
very
heart
of
one
or
other
of
the
division
to
take
their

almost

<EOS>
one
morning
I
be
sit
in
the
carré
,
at
work
upon
a
piece
of
embroidery
which
one
of
the
pupil
have
commence
but
delay
to
finish
,
and
while
my
finger
work
at
the
frame
,
my
ear
regale
themselves
with
listen
to
the
crescendo
and
cadence
of
a
voice
harangue
in
the
neighbouring
classe
,
in
tone
that
wax
momentarily
more
unquiet
,
more
ominously
varied
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
good
strong
partition
-
wall
between
me
and
the
gathering
storm
,
as
well
as
a
facile
mean
of
flight
through
the
glass

door
to
the
court
,
in
case
it
sweep
this
way
;
so
I
be
afraid
I
derive
more
amusement
than
alarm
from
these
thicken
symptom
.
<EOS>
poor
Rosine
be
not
safe
:
four
time
that
bless
morning
<EOS>
have
she
make
the
passage
of
peril
;
and
now
,
for
the
fifth
time
,
it
become
her
dangerous
duty
to
snatch
,
as
it
be
,
a

the
burning
 
a

Ere

this

utter
itself
:

"
Mademoiselle

I
would
not

a
five

franc
piece
go
into

just
now
:
Monsieur

be
really
terrible

and
here
be
a
commissionaire
come
with
a
message
from
the

<EOS>
I
have
tell
Madame

I

Me

<EOS>
no

have
cross

really

<EOS>
Ouf

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
bah
!
<EOS>
you
be
only
a
coward
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
message
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
precisely
of
the
kind
with
which
Monsieur
least
like
to
be
pester
:
an
urgent
summon
to
go
directly
to
the
Athénée
,
as
there
be
an
official
visitor
 
inspector
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
 
arrive
,
and
Monsieur
_
must
_
meet
him
<EOS>
:
you
know
how
he
hate
a
_
<EOS>
must
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
yes
,
I
know
well
enough
.
<EOS>
the
restive
little
man
detest
spur
or
curb
:
against
whatever
be
urgent
or
obligatory
,
he
be
sure
to
revolt
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
accept
the
responsibility
 
not
,
certainly
,
without
fear
,
but
fear
blent
with
other
sentiment
,
curiosity
,
amongst
them
.
<EOS>
I
open
the
door
,
I
enter
<EOS>
,
I
close
it
behind
me
as
quickly
and
quietly
as
a
rather
unsteady
hand
would
permit
;
for
to
be
slow
or
bustling
,
to
rattle
a
latch
,
or
leave
a
door
gape
wide
,
be
aggravation
of
crime
often
more
disastrous
in
result
than
the
main
crime
itself
.
<EOS>
there
I
stand
then
,
and
there
he
sit
;
his
humour
be
visibly
bad
 
<EOS>
almost
at
its
bad
;
he
have
be
give
a
lesson
in
arithmetic
 
for
he
give
lesson
on
any
and
every
subject
that
strike
his
fancy
 
and
arithmetic
be
a
dry
subject
,
invariably
disagree
with
him
:
not
a
pupil
but
tremble
when
he
speak
of
figure
.
<EOS>
He
sit
,
bent
above
his
desk
:
to
look
up
at
the
sound
of
an
entrance
,
at
the
occurrence
of
a
direct
breach
of
his
will
and
law
,
be
an
effort
he
could
not
for
the
moment
bring
himself
to
make
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
as
well
:
I
thus
gain
time
to
walk
up
the
long
classe
;
and
it
suit
my
idiosyncracy
far
better
to
encounter
the
near
burst
of
anger
like
his
,
than
to
bear
its
menace
at
a
distance
.
  
<EOS>
at
his
estrade
I
pause
,
just
in
front
;
of
course
I
be
not
worthy
of
immediate
attention
:
he
proceed
with
his
lesson
.
<EOS>
disdain
would
not
do
:
he
must
hear
and
he
must
answer
my
message
.
  
<EOS>
not
be
quite
tall
enough
to
lift
my
head
over
his
desk
,
elevate
upon
the
estrade
,
and
thus
suffer
eclipse
in
my
present
position
,
I
venture
to
peep
round
,
with
the
design
,
at
first
,
of
merely
get
a
well
view
of
his
face
,
which
have
strike
me
when
I
enter
as
bear
a
close
and
picturesque
resemblance
to
that
of
a
black
and
sallow
tiger
.
<EOS>
twice
do
I
enjoy
this
side
-
view
with
impunity
,
advance
and
recede
unseen
;
the
third
time
my
eye
have
scarce
dawn
beyond
the
obscuration
of
the
desk
,
when
it
be
catch
and
transfix
through
its
very
pupil
 
transfix
by
the
"
lunette
.
<EOS>
"
Rosine
be
right
;
these
utensil
have
in
them
a
blank
and
immutable
terror
,
beyond
the
mobile
wrath
of
the
wearer
's
own
unglazed
eye
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
find
the
advantage
of
proximity
:
these
short
-
sighted
"
lunette
"
be
useless
for
the
inspection
of
a
criminal
under
Monsieur
's
nose
;
accordingly
,
he
doff
them
,
and
he
and
I
stand
on
more
equal
term
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
glad
I
be
not
really
much
afraid
of
him
 
<EOS>
that
,
indeed
,
close
in
his
presence
,
I
feel
no
terror
at
all
;
for
upon
his
demand
cord
and
gibbet
to
execute
the
sentence
recently
pronounce
,
I
be
able
to
furnish
him
with
a
needleful
of
embroider
thread
with
such
accommodate
civility
as
could
not
but
allay
some
portion
at
least
of
his
surplus
irritation
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
do
not
parade
this
courtesy
before
public
view
:
I
merely
hand
the
thread
round
the
angle
of
the
desk
,
and
attach
it
,
ready
noose
,
to
the
bar
back
of
the
Professor
's
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
que
me
voulez
-
vous
?
"
say
he
in
a
growl
of
which
the
music
be
wholly
confine
to
his
chest
and
throat
,
for
he
keep
his
tooth
clench
;
and
seem
register
to
himself
an
inward
vow
that
nothing
earthly
should
wring
from
him
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
My
answer
commence
uncompromisingly
:
"
Monsieur
,
"
I
say
,
"
je
veux
l'impossible
,
des
chose
inouïes
;
"
and
think
it
best
not
to
mince
matter
,
but
to
administer
the
"
douche
"
with
decision
,
in
a
low
but
quick
voice
,
I
deliver
the
athenian
message
,
floridly
exaggerate
its
urgency
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
,
he
would
not
hear
a
word
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
He
would
not
go
;
he
would
not
leave
his
present
class
,
let
all
the
official
of
Villette
send
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
put
himself
an
inch
out
of
his
way
at
the
bidding
of
king
,
cabinet
,
and
chamber
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
know
,
however
,
that
he
_
must
_
go
;
that
,
talk
as
he
would
,
both
his
duty
and
interest
command
an
immediate
and
literal
compliance
with
the
summon
:
I
stand
,
therefore
,
wait
in
silence
,
as
if
he
have
not
yet
speak
.
<EOS>
He
ask
what
more
I
want
.
  
<EOS>
"
only
Monsieur
's
answer
to
deliver
to
the
commissionaire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
wave
an
impatient
negative
.
  
<EOS>
I
venture
to
stretch
my
hand
to
the
bonnet
-
grec
which
lie
in
grim
repose
on
the
window
-
sill
.
<EOS>
He
follow
this
dare
movement
with
his
eye
,
no
doubt
in
mixed
pity
and
amazement
at
its
presumption
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
mutter
,
"
if
it
come
to
that
 
if
Miss
Lucy
meddle
with
his
bonnet
-
grec
 
<EOS>
she
may
just
put
it
on
herself
,
turn
garçon
for
the
occasion
,
and
benevolently
go
to
the
Athénée
in
his
stead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
great
respect
,
I
lay
the
bonnet
on
the
desk
,
where
its
tassel
seem
to
give
me
an
awful
nod
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
write
a
note
of
apology
 
that
will
do
!
"
<EOS>
say
he
,
still
bent
on
evasion
.
  
<EOS>
know
<EOS>
well
it
would
_
not
_
do
,
I
gently
push
the
bonnet
towards
his
hand
.
<EOS>
thus
impel
,
it
slide
down
the
polished
slope
of
the
varnished
and
unbaized
desk
,
carry
before
it
the
light
steel
-
frame
"
lunette
,
"
and
,
fearful
to
relate
,
they
fall
to
the
estrade
.
<EOS>
a
score
of
time
ere
now
have
I
see
them
fall
and
receive
no
damage
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
this
_
time
,
as
Lucy
Snowe
's
hapless
luck
would
have
it
,
they
so
fall
that
each
clear
pebble
become
a
shivered
and
shapeless
star
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
indeed
,
dismay
seize
me
 
dismay
and
regret
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
value
of
these
"
lunette
"
:
<EOS>
M.
Paul
's
sight
be
peculiar
,
not
easily
fit
,
and
these
glass
suit
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
him
call
them
his
treasure
:
as
I
pick
them
up
,
cracked
and
worthless
,
my
hand
tremble
.
<EOS>
frighten
through
all
my
nerve
I
be
to
see
the
mischief
I
have
do
,
but
I
think
I
be
even
more
sorry
than
afraid
.
<EOS>
for
some
second
I
dare
not
look
the
bereave
Professor
in
the
face
;
he
be
the
first
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
là
!
"
say
he
:
"
me
voilà
veuf
de
mes
lunettes

<EOS>
I
think
Mademoiselle
Lucy
will
now
confess
that
the
cord
and
gallow
be
amply
earn
;
she
tremble
in
anticipation
of
her
doom
.
<EOS>
ah
,
traitress
!
<EOS>
traitress
!
<EOS>
You
be
resolve
to
have
me
quite
blind
and
helpless
in
your
hand
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
lift
my
eye
:
<EOS>
his
face
,
instead
of
be
irate
,
lower
,
and
furrow
,
be
overflow
with
the
smile
,
colour
with
the
bloom
I
have
see
brighten
it
that
evening
at
the
Hotel
Crécy
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
angry
 
not
even
grieve
.
<EOS>
for
the
real

<EOS>

seem

of
management
so
long

no

pliant

as

in
his

a

contrite
offender

<EOS>
still
gently
rail
at
me
as
"

une
Anglaise
<EOS>
terrible
 
une

<EOS>
he
declare
that
he
dare
not
but
obey
one
who
have
give
such
an
instance
of
her
dangerous
prowess
;
it
be
absolutely
like
the
"
grand
Empereur
smash
the
vase
to
inspire
dismay
.
"
<EOS>
so
,
at
last
,
crown
himself
with
his
bonnet

grec
,
and
take
his
ruin
"
lunette
"
from
my
hand
with
a
clasp
of
kind
pardon
and
encouragement
,
he
make
his
bow
,
and
go
off
to
the
Athénée
in
first
-
rate
humour
and
spirit
.
     
<EOS>
after
all
this
amiability
,
the
reader
will
be
sorry
for
my
sake
to
hear
that
I
be
quarrel
with
M.
Paul
again
before
night
;
yet
so
it
be
,
and
I
could
not
help
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
his
occasional
custom
 
and
a
very
laudable
,
acceptable
custom
,
too
 
to
arrive
of
an
evening
,
always
à
l'improviste
,
unannounced
<EOS>
,
burst
in
on
the
silent
hour
of
study
,
establish
a
sudden
despotism
over
us
and
our
occupation
,
cause
book
to
be
put
away
,
work
-
bag
to
be
bring
out
,
and
,
draw
forth
a
single
thick
volume
,
or
a
handful
of
pamphlet
,
substitute
for
the
besotted
"

drawl
by
a
sleepy
pupil
,
some
tragedy
make
grand
by
grand
reading
,
ardent
by
fiery
action
 
<EOS>
some
drama
,
whereof
,
for
my
part
,
I
rarely
study
the
intrinsic
merit
;
for
M.
Emanuel
make
it
a
vessel
for
an
outpouring
,
and
fill
it
with
his
native
verve
and
passion
like
a
cup
with
a
vital
brewage
.
<EOS>
or
else
he
would
flash
through
our
conventual
darkness
a
reflex
of
a
bright
world
,
show
us
a
glimpse
of
the
current
literature
of
the
day

read
us
passage
from
some
enchanting
tale
,
or
the
last
witty
feuilleton
which
have
awaken
laughter
in
the
saloon
of
Paris
;
take
care
always
to
expunge
,
with
the
severe
hand
,
whether
from
tragedy
,
melodrama
,
tale
,
or
essay
,
whatever
passage
,
phrase
,

could
be
deem
unsuited

an
audience
of

<EOS>
"
I
notice
more
than
once
,
that
where
retrenchment
without
substitute
would
have
leave
unmeaning
vacancy
,
or
introduce
weakness
,
he
could
,
and
do
,
improvise
whole
paragraph
,
no
less
vigorous
than
irreproachable
;
the
dialogue
 
<EOS>
the
description
 
he
engraft
be
often
far
well
than
that
he
prune
away
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
on
the
evening
in
question
,
we
be
sit
silent
as
nun
in
a
"
retreat
,
"
the
pupil
study
,
the
teacher
work

<EOS>
I
remember
my
work
;
it
be
a
slight
matter
of
fancy
,
and
it
rather
interest
me
;
it
have
a
purpose
;
I
be
not
do
it
merely
to
kill
time
;
I
mean
it
when
finish
as
a
gift
;
and
the
occasion
of
presentation
be
near
,
haste
be
requisite
,
and
my
finger
be
busy
.
  
<EOS>
We
hear
the
sharp
bell
-
peal
which
we
all
know
;
then
the
rapid
step
familiar
to
each
ear
:
the
word
"
Voilà
Monsieur
!
"
<EOS>
have
scarcely
break
simultaneously
from
every
lip
,
when
the
two
-
leaved
door
split
(
as
split
it
always
do
for
his
admission
 
such
a
slow
word
as
"
open
"
be
inefficient
to
describe
his
movement
)
,
and
he
stand
in
the
midst
of
us
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
two
study
table
,
both
long
and
flank
with
bench
;
over
the
centre
of
each
hang
a
lamp
;
beneath
this
lamp
,
on
either
side
the
table
,
sit
a
teacher
;
the
girl
be
arrange
to
the
right
hand
and
the
left
;
the
eld
and
most
studious
near
the
lamp
or
tropic
;
the
idler
and
little
one
towards
the
north
and
south
pole
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
's
habit
be
politely
to
hand
a
chair
to
some
teacher
,
generally
Zélie
St.
Pierre
,
the
senior
mistress
;
then
to
take
her
vacate
seat
;
and
thus
avail
himself
of
the
full
beam
of
Cancer
or
Capricorn
,
which
,
owe
to
his
near
sight
,
he
need
.
  
<EOS>
as
usual
,
Zélie
rise
with
alacrity
,
smile
to
the
whole
extent
of
her
mouth
,
and
the
full
display
of
her
upper
and
under
row
of
tooth
 
that
strange
smile
which
pass
from
ear
to
ear
,
and
be
mark
only
by
a
sharp
thin
curve
,
which
fail
to
spread
over
the
countenance
,
and
neither
dimple
the
cheek
nor
light
the
eye
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
Monsieur
do
not
see
her
,
or
he
have
take
a
whim
that
he
would
not
notice
her
,
for
he
be
as
capricious
as
woman
be
say
to
be
;
then
his
"
lunette
"
(
he
have
get
another
pair
)
serve
him
as
an
excuse
for
all
sort
of
little
oversight
and
shortcoming
.
<EOS>
whatever
may
be
his
reason
,
he
pass
by
Zélie
,
come
to
the
other
side
of
the
table
,
and
before
I
could
start
up
to
clear
the
way
,
whisper
,
"
<EOS>
Ne
bougez
pas
,
"
and
establish
himself
between
me
and
Miss
Fanshawe
,
who
always
would
be
my
neighbour
,
and
have
her
elbow
in
my
side
<EOS>
,
however
often
I
declare
to
her
,
"
Ginevra
,
I
wish
you
be
at
Jericho
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
say
,
"
Ne
bougez
pas
;
"
but
how
could
I
help
it
?
<EOS>
I
must
make
him
room
,
and
I
must
request
the
pupil
to
recede
that
_
I
_
may
recede
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
well
for
Ginevra
to
be
gum
to
me
,
"
keep
herself
warm
,
"
as
she
say
,
on
the
winter
evening
,
and
harass
my
very
heart
with
her
fidgeting
and
poking
,
oblige
me
,
indeed
,
sometimes
to
put
an
artful
pin
in
my
girdle
by
way
of
protection
against
her
elbow
;
but
I
suppose
M.
Emanuel
be
not
to
be
subject
to
the
same
kind
of
treatment
,
so
I
sweep
away
my
working
material
,
to
clear
space
for
his
book
,
and
withdraw
myself
to
make
room
for
his
person
;
not
,
however
,
leave
more
than
a
yard
of
interval
,
just
what
any
reasonable
man
would
have
regard
as
a
convenient
,
respectful
allowance
of
bench
.
<EOS>
but
M.
Emanuel
never
_
be
_
reasonable
;
flint
and
tinder
that
he
be
!
<EOS>
he
strike
and
take
fire
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
vous
ne
voulez
pas
de
moi
pour
voisin
,
"
he
growl
:
"
vous
vous
donnez
des
airs
de
caste
;
vous
me
traitez
en
paria
;
"
he
scowl
.
"
<EOS>
Soit
!
<EOS>
je
<EOS>
vais
arranger
la

"
<EOS>
and
he
set
to
work
.
  
<EOS>
"
levez
vous
toute
,
Mesdemoiselles
!
"
cry
he
.
  
<EOS>
the
girl
rise
.
<EOS>
He
make
them
all
file
off
to
the
other
table
.
<EOS>
He
then
place
me
at
one
extremity
of
the
long
bench
,
and
have
duly
and
carefully
bring
me
my
work
-
basket
,
silk
,
scissor
,
all
my
implement
,
he
fix
himself
quite
at
the
other
end
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
arrangement
,
highly
absurd
as
it
be
,
not
a
soul
in
the
room
dare
to
laugh
;
luckless
for
the
giggler
would
have
be
the
giggle
.
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
I
take
it
with
entire
coolness
.
<EOS>
there
I
sit
,
isolate
and
cut
off
from
human
intercourse
;
I
sit
and
mind
my
work
,
and
be
quiet
,
and
not
at
all
unhappy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Est
ce
assez
de

?
<EOS>
"
he
demand
.
  
<EOS>
"
monsieur

say
I.
  
"

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
with
this
assertion
he
commence
the
reading
.
  
<EOS>
for
his
misfortune
he
have
choose
a
french
translation
of
what
he
call
"
un
drame
de
Williams
Shackspire
;
le
faux
dieu
,
"
he
further
announce
,
"
de
ces
sots
païens
,
le
Anglais
.
<EOS>
"
how
far
otherwise
he
would
have
characterize
him
have
his
temper
not
be
upset
,
I
scarcely
need
intimate
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
,
the
translation
be
French
,
be
very
inefficient
;
nor
do
I
make
any
particular
effort
to
conceal
the
contempt
which
some
of
its
forlorn
lapse
be
calculate
to
excite
.
<EOS>
not
that
it
behove
or
beseem
me
to
say
anything
:
but
one
can
occasionally
_
look
_
<EOS>
the
opinion
it
be
forbid
to
embody
in
word
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
's
lunette
be
on
the
alert
,
he
glean
up
every
stray
look
;
I
do
not
think
he
lose
one
:
the
consequence
be
,
his
eye
soon
discard
a
screen
,
that
their
blaze
may
sparkle
free
,
and
he
wax
hotter
at
the
north
pole
to
which
he
have
voluntarily
exile
himself
,
than
,
consider
the
general
temperature
of
the
room
<EOS>
,
it
would
have
be
reasonable
to
become
under
the
vertical
ray
of
Cancer
itself
.
  
<EOS>
the
reading
over
,
it
appear
problematic
whether
he
would
depart
with
his
anger
unexpresse
,
or
whether
he
would
give
it
vent
.
<EOS>
suppression
be
not
much
in
his
habit
;
but
still
,
what
have
be
do
to
him
definite
enough
to
afford
matter
for
overt
reproof
?
<EOS>
I
have
not
utter
a
sound
,
and
could
not
justly
be
deem
amenable
to
reprimand
or
penalty
for
have
permit
a
slightly
free
action
than
usual
to
the
muscle
about
my
eye
and
mouth
.

They
take
it

<EOS>
I
also
accept
a
roll
and
glass
,
but
be
now
more
than
ever
interested
in
my
work
,
I
keep
my
seat
of
punishment

and
work
while
I
munch
my
bread
and
sip
my

the
whole
with
easy
_

;
with
a
certain
snugness
of
composure
,
indeed
,
scarcely
in
my
habit
,
and
pleasantly
novel
to
my
feeling
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
the
presence
of
a
nature
so
restless
,
chafe
,
thorny
as
that
of
M.
Paul
absorb
all
feverish
and
unsettling
influence
like
a

leave

none

such
as

placid

Will

no

<EOS>
the
girl
and
teacher

gather
round
the
other
table

be
talk
pretty
freely

they
always
talk
at
meal
;

,
from
the
constant
habit

speak
fast

loud
at

stoop

as
be
literally
true
in
his
case
 
to
"
hiss
"
into
my
ear
some
poignant
word

<EOS>
He
say
that
,
of
all
the
woman
he
know

I
be
the
one
who
could
make
herself
the
most
consummately
unpleasant

I
be
she
with
whom
it
be

possible

I
have
a

how
I

be

M.

wish
me
well
enough

he
have
never
do
me
any

claim
a
right

guiltless

,
how
I
behave

with
what
pungent
vivacity
 
<EOS>
what
an
impetus

what
a

here
I
could
not

open

somewhat
wide

in

he

in

I
own
it
puzzle
me
to
guess
:

when
I
ask

he
say
it

all

with

besides
,

I

inquire

declare
about
this

that
she
be
tired

death

seclusion

that
she
long

would

long

<EOS>
Monsieur

's
eye
be
certainly
often
upon
her

<EOS>
He
would
sit
and
watch
her
perseveringly
for
minute
together

<EOS>
I
have
see
him
give
her
a
quarter
-
of
-
an

hour
's
gaze
,
while
the
class
be
silently
compose
,
and
he
sit
throne
on
his
estrade

unoccupied

<EOS>
conscious
always
of
this
basilisk
attention
,
she
would
writhe
under
it
,
half
-
flatter
,
half
-
puzzle
,
and
Monsieur
would
follow
her
sensation
,
sometimes
look
appallingly
acute
;
for
in
some
case
,
he
have
the
terrible
unerring
penetration
of
instinct
,
and
pierce
in
its
hiding
-
place
the
last
lurk
thought
of
the
heart
,
and
discern
under
florid
veiling
the
bare
;
<EOS>
barren
place
of
the
spirit
:
<EOS>
yes
,
and
its
perverted
tendency
,
and
its
hide
false
curve
 
all
that
man
and
woman
would
not
have
know
 
the
twist
spine
,
the
malforme
limb
that
be
bear
with
them
,
and
far
bad
,
the
stain
or
disfigurement
they
have
perhaps
bring
on
themselves
.
<EOS>
no
calamity
so
accurse
but
M.
Emanuel
could
pity
and
forgive
,
if
it
be
acknowledge
candidly
;
but
where
his
question
eye
meet
dishonest
denial
 
where
his
ruthless
research
find
deceitful
concealment
 
<EOS>
oh
,
then
,
he
could
be
cruel
,
and
I
think
wicked
!
<EOS>
he
would
exultantly
snatch
the
screen
from
poor
shrink
wretch
,
passionately
hurry
them
to
the
summit
of
the
mount
of
exposure
,
and
there
show
them
all
naked
,
all
false
 
poor
living
lie
 
the
spawn
of
that
horrid
Truth
which
can
not
be

<EOS>
He
think
he
do
justice
;
for
my
part
I
doubt
whether
man
have
a
right
to
do
such
justice
on
man
:
more
than
once
in
these
his
visitation
,
I
have
feel
compel
to
give
tear
to
his
victim
,
and
not
spare
ire
and
keen
reproach
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
deserve
it
;
but
it
be
difficult
to
shake
him
in
his
firm
conviction
that
the
work
be
righteous
and
need
.

Breakfast

like

grow

when

be
gather

they
cease

<EOS>
I
look
on
them
as

rootless

perishable

their
likeness
to

make
me
sad

I
never

not

Miss
Lucie

"
she
say
:
"
silly
I
have
go
and
throw
away
two
franc
on
a
bouquet
of
hot
-
house
flower

"
  
<EOS>
and
she
show
with
pride
her
splendid
nosegay
.
  
<EOS>
but
hush
!
<EOS>
a
step
:
<EOS>
_
the
_
step
.
<EOS>
It
come
prompt
,
as
usual
,
but
with
a
promptitude
,
we
feel
disposed
to
flatter
ourselves
,
inspire
by
other
feeling
than
mere
excitability
of
nerve
and
vehemence
of
intent
.
<EOS>
We
think
our
Professor
's
"
foot
-
fall
"
(
to
speak
romantically
)
have
in
it
a
friendly
promise
this
morning
;
and
so
it
have
.
  
<EOS>
He
enter
in
a
mood
which
make
him
as
good
as
a
new
sunbeam
to
the
already
well
-
light
first
classe
.
<EOS>
the
morning
light
play
amongst
our
plant
and
laugh
on
our
wall
,
catch
an
add
lustre
from
M.
Paul
's
all
-
benignant
salute
.
<EOS>
like
a
true
Frenchman
(
though
I
do
not
know
why
I
should
say
so
,
for
he
be
of
strain
<EOS>
neither
French
nor
Labassecourien
)
,
he
have
dress
for
the
"
situation
"
and
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
not
by
the
vague
fold
,
sinister
and
conspirator
-
like
,
of
his
soot
-
dark
paletôt
be
the
outline
of
his
person
obscure
;
on
the
contrary
,
his
figure
(
such
as
it
be
,
I
do
not
boast
of
it
)
be
well
set
off
by
a
civilized
coat
and
a
silken
vest
quite
pretty
to
behold
.
<EOS>
the
defiant
and
pagan
bonnet
-
grec
have
vanish
:
bare
-
head
,
he
come
upon
us
,
carry
a
christian
hat
in
his
gloved
hand
.
<EOS>
the
little
man
look
well
,
very
well
;
there
be
a
clearness
of
amity
in
his
blue
eye
,
and
a
glow
of
good
feeling
on
his
dark
complexion
,
which
pass
perfectly
in
the
place
of
beauty
:
one
really
do
not
care
to
observe
that
his
nose
,
though
far
from
small
,
be
of
no
particular
shape
,
<EOS>
his
cheek
thin
,
his
brow
mark
and
square
,
his
mouth
<EOS>
no
rise
-
bud
:
<EOS>
one
accept
him
as
he
be
,
and
feel
his
presence
the
reverse
of
damping
or
insignificant
.
  
<EOS>
He
pass
to
his
desk
;
he
place
on
the
same
his
hat
and
glove
.
"
<EOS>
Bon
jour
,
mes
amie
,
"
say
he
,
in
a
tone
that
somehow
make
amend
to
some
amongst
us
for
many
a
sharp
snap
and
savage
snarl
:
not
a
jocund
,
good
-
fellow
tone
,
still
less
an
unctuous
priestly
,
accent
,
but
a
voice
he
have
belong
to
himself
 
a
voice
use
when
his
heart
pass
the
word
to
his
lip
.
<EOS>
that
same
heart
do
speak
sometimes
;
though
an
irritable
,
it
be
not
an
ossified
organ
:
in
its
core
be
a
place
,
tender
beyond
a
man
's
tenderness
;
a
place
that
humble
him
to
little
child
,
that
bind
him
to
girl
and
woman
to
whom
,
rebel
as
he
would
,
he
could
not
disown
his
affinity
,
nor
quite
deny
that
,
on
the
whole
,
he
be
well
with
them
than
with
his
own
sex
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
all
wish
Monsieur
a
good
day
,
and
present
to
him
our
congratulation
on
the
anniversary
of
his
fête

"
say
Mademoiselle
Zélie
,
constitute
herself
spokeswoman
of
the
assembly
;
and
advance
with
no
more
twist
of
affectation
than
be
with
her
indispensable
to
the
achievement
of
motion
,
she
lay
her
costly
bouquet
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
bow
over
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
long
train
of
offering
follow
:
all
the
pupil
,
sweeping
past
with
the
glide
step
foreigner
practise
,
leave
their
tribute
as
they
go
by
.
<EOS>
each
girl
so
dexterously
adjust
her
separate
gift
,
that
when
the
last
bouquet
be
lay
on
the
desk
,
it
form
the
apex
to
a
blooming
pyramid
 
a
pyramid
blooming
,
spread
,
and
tower
with
such
exuberance
as
,
in
the
end
,
to
eclipse
the
hero
behind
it
.
<EOS>
this
ceremony
over
,
seat
be
resume
,
and
we
sit
in
dead
silence
,
expectant
of
a
speech
.
  
<EOS>
I
suppose
five
minute
may
have
elapse
,
and
the
hush
remain
unbroken
;
ten
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
no
sound
.
  
<EOS>
many
present
begin
,
doubtless
,
to
wonder
for
what
Monsieur
wait
;
as
well
they
may
.
<EOS>
voiceless
and
viewless
,
stirless
and
wordless
,
he
keep
his
station
behind
the
pile
of
flower
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
there
issue
forth
a
voice
,
rather
deep
,
as
if
it
speak
out
of
a
hollow
:
    
"
Est
-
ce
là
tout
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
Zélie
look
round
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
all
present
your
bouquet
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
she
of
the
pupil
.
  
<EOS>
yes
;
they
have
all
give
their
nosegay
,
from
the
eld
to
the
young
,
from
the
tall
to
the
most
diminutive

<EOS>
the
senior
mistress
signify
as
much

<EOS>
"
Est

"
be
reiterate
in
an
intonation
which
,
deep
before
,
have
now
descend
some
note
lower
.
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
,
"
say
Mademoiselle
St.
Pierre
,
rise
,
and
<EOS>
this
time
speak
with
her
own
sweet
smile
,
"
I
have
the
honour
to
tell
you
that
,
with
a
single
exception
,
every
person
in

have
offer
her
bouquet
.
<EOS>
for
Meess
Lucie
,
Monsieur
will
kindly
make
allowance
;
as
a
foreigner
she
probably
do
not
know
our
custom
,
or
do
not
appreciate
their
significance
.
<EOS>
Meess
Lucie
have
regard
this
ceremony
as
too
frivolous
to
be
honour
by
her
observance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
famous

"
I
mutter
between
my
tooth
:
"
you
be
no
bad
speaker
,
Zélie
,
when
you
begin
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
answer
vouchsafe
to
Mademoiselle
St
Pierre
from
the
estrade
be
give
in
the
gesticulation
of
a
hand
from
behind
the
pyramid
.
<EOS>
this
manual
action
seem
to
deprecate
word
,
to
enjoin
silence

<EOS>
a
form
,
ere
long
,
follow
the
hand
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
emerge
from
his
eclipse
;
and
produce
himself
on
the
front
of
his
estrade
,
and
gaze
straight
and
fixedly
before
him
at
a
vast
"
mappe
-
monde
"
cover
the
wall
opposite
,
he
demand
a
third
time
,
and
now
in
really
tragic
tone
    
"
Est
-
ce
là
tout
?
<EOS>
"
  
I
may
yet
have
make
all
right
,
by
step
forwards
and
slip
into
his
hand
the
ruddy
little
shell
-
box
I
at
that
moment
hold
tight
in
my
own
.
<EOS>
It
be
what
I
have
fully
purpose
to
do
;
but
,
first
,
the
comic
side
of
Monsieur
's
behaviour
have
tempt
me
to
delay
,
and
now
,
Mademoiselle
St.
Pierre
's
affected
interference
provoke
contumacity
.
<EOS>
the
reader
not
have
hitherto
have
any
cause
to
ascribe
to
Miss
Snowe
's
character
the
most
distant
pretension
to
perfection
,
will
be
scarcely
surprised
to
learn
that
she
feel
too
perverse
to
defend
herself
from
any
imputation
the
Parisienne
may
choose
to
insinuate
and
besides
,
M.
Paul
be
so
tragic
,
and
take
my
defection
so
seriously
<EOS>
,
he
deserve
to
be
vex

<EOS>
I
keep
,
then
,
both
my
box
and
my
countenance
,
and
sit
insensate
as
any
stone
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
well
!
<EOS>
"
drop
at
length
from
the
lip
of
M.
Paul
;
and
have
utter
this
phrase
,
the
shadow
of
some
great
paroxysm
 
the
swell
of
wrath
,
scorn
,
resolve
 
pass
over
his
brow
,
ripple
his
lip
,
and
line
his
cheek
.
<EOS>
gulp
down
all
further
comment
,
he
launch
into
his
customary
"
discour

"
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
at
all
remember
what
this
"
discours
"
be
;
I
do
not
listen
to
it
:
the
gulping
-
down
process
,
the
abrupt
dismissal
of
his
mortification
or
vexation
,
have
give
me
a
sensation
which
half
-
counteract
the
ludicrous
effect
of
the
reiterated
"
Est
-
ce

tout

"
  
<EOS>
towards
the
close
of
the
speech
there
come
a
pleasing
diversion
my
attention
be
again
amusingly
arrest
.
  
<EOS>
owe
to
some
little
accidental
movement
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
drop
my
thimble
on
the
floor
,
and
in
stoop
to
regain
it
,
hit
the
crown
of
my
head
against
the
sharp
corner
of
my
desk
;
<EOS>
which
casualtie
(
exasperate
to
me
,
by
right
,
if
to
anybody
)
naturally
make
a
slight
bustle
 
<EOS>
M.
Paul
become
irritated
,
and
dismiss
his
force
equanimity
,
and
cast
to
the
wind
that
dignity
and
self
-
control
with
which
he
never
care
long
to
encumber
himself
,
he
break
forth
into
the
strain
best
calculate
to
give
him
ease
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
,
in
the
progress
of
his
"
discour
,
"
he
have
contrive
to
cross
the
Channel
and
land
on
british
ground
;
but
there
I
find
him
when
I
begin
to
listen
.
  
<EOS>
cast
a
quick
,
cynical
glance
round
the
room
 
a
glance
which
scathe
,
or
be
intend
to
scathe
,
as
it
cross
me
 
<EOS>
he
fall
with
fury
upon
"
les
Anglaises
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
never
have
I
hear
english
woman
handle
as
M.
Paul
that
morning
handle
them
:
he
spare
nothing
 
neither
their
mind
,
moral
,
manner
,
nor
personal
appearance
.
<EOS>
I
specially
remember
his
abuse
of
their
tall
stature
,
their
long
neck
,
their
thin
arm
,
their
slovenly
dress
,
their
pedantic
education
,
their
impious
scepticism
(
!
)
,
their
insufferable
pride
,
their
pretentious
virtue
:
over
which
he
grind
his
tooth
malignantly
,
and
look
as
if
,
have
he
dare
,
he
would
have
say
singular
thing
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
he
be
spiteful
,
acrid
,
savage
;
and
,
as
a
natural
consequence
,
detestably
ugly
.
  
<EOS>
"
little
wicked
venomous
man
!
"
<EOS>
think
I
;
"
be
I
go
to
harass
myself
with
fear
of
displease
you
,
or
hurt
your
feeling
?
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
;
you
shall
be
indifferent
to
me
,
as
the
shabby
bouquet
in
your
pyramid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
grieve
to
say
I
could
not
quite
carry
out
this
resolution
.
<EOS>
for
some
time
the
abuse
of
England
and
the
English
find
and
leave
me
stolid
:
I
bear
it
some
fifteen
minute
stoically
enough
;
but
this
hiss
cockatrice
be
determine
to
ste
,
and
he
say
such
thing
at
last
 
fastening
not
only
upon
our
woman
,
but
upon
our
great
name
and
good
man
;
sully
,
the
shield
of
Britannia
,
and
dabble
the
union
jack
in
mud
 
that
I
be
sting
.
<EOS>
with
vicious
relish
he
bring
up
the
most
spicy
current
continental
historical
falsehood
 
than
which
nothing
can
be
conceive
more
offensive
.
<EOS>
Zélie
,
and
the
whole
class
,
become
one
grin
of
vindictive
delight
;
for
it
be
curious
to
discover
how
these
clown
of
Labassecour
secretly
hate
England
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
I
strike
a
sharp
stroke
on
my
desk
,
open
my
lip
,
and
let
loose
this
cry
:
    
<EOS>
"
Vive
l'Angleterre
,
l'Histoire
et
les
Héros
!
<EOS>
a
bas
<EOS>
la
France
,
la
Fiction
et
les
Faquins
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
class
be
strike
of
a
heap
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
they
think
me
mad
.
<EOS>
the
Professor
put
up
his
handkerchief
,
and
fiendishly
smile
into
its
fold
.
<EOS>
little
monster
of
malice
!
<EOS>
He
now
think
he
have
get
the
victory
,
since
he
have
make
me
angry
.
<EOS>
in
a
second
he
become
good
-
humoured
.
<EOS>
with
great
blandness
he
resume
the
subject
of
his
flower
;
talk
poetically
and
symbolically
of
their
sweetness
,
perfume
,
purity
,
etcetera
;
make
frenchified
comparison
between
the
"
jeunes
fille
"
and
the
sweet
blossom
before
him
;
pay
Mademoiselle
St.
Pierre
a
very
full
-
blown
compliment
on
the
superiority
of
her
bouquet
;
and
end
by
announce
that
the
first
really
fine
,
mild
,
and
balmy
morning
in
spring
,
he
intend
to
take
the
whole
class
out
to
breakfast
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
such
of
the
class
,
at
least
,
"
he
add
,
with
emphasis
,
"
as
he
could
count
amongst
the
number
of
his
friend
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Donc
je
n'y
serai
pas
,
"
declare
I
,
involuntarily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Soit
!
<EOS>
"
be
his
response
;
and
,
gather
his
flower
in
his
arm
,
he
flash
out
of
classe
;
while
I
,
consign
my
work
,
scissor
,
thimble
,
and
the
neglect
little
box
,
to
my
desk
,
sweep
up

stair
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
_
<EOS>
he
_
feel
hot
and
angry
,
but
I
be
free
to
confess
that
_
I
_
do
.
  
<EOS>
yet
with
a
strange
evanescent
anger
,
I
have
not
sit
an
hour
on
the
edge
of
my
bed
,
picture
and
repicture
his
look
,
manner
,
word
ere
I
smile
at
the
whole
scene
.
<EOS>
a
little
pang
of
regret
<EOS>
I
undergo
that
the
box
have
not
be
offer
.
<EOS>
I
have
mean
to
gratify
him
.
<EOS>
fate
would
not
have
it
so
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
,
remember
that
desk
in
classe
be
by
no
mean
inviolate
repository
,
and
think
that
it
be
as
well
to
secure
the
box
,
on
account
of
the
initial

the
lid

so

solemn

its

branched

and
its
horizontal

silent

enjoy
its

<EOS>
I
rather
wonder
to
find
the
first

door
ajar
;
this
room
be
usually
lock
when
empty
,
and
be
then
inaccessible
to
any
save
Madame
Beck
and
myself
,
who
possess
a
duplicate
key

<EOS>
I
wonder
still
more
,
on
approach
,
to
hear
a
vague
movement
as
of
life
 
a
step
,
a
chair
stir
,
a
sound
like
the
opening
of
a
desk
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
only
Madame
Beck
do
inspection
duty
,
"
be
the
conclusion
follow
a
moment
's
reflection
.
<EOS>
the
partially
-
open
door
give
opportunity
for
assurance
on
this
point
.
<EOS>
I
look
.
<EOS>
behold
!
<EOS>
not
the
inspect
garb
of
Madame
Beck
 
<EOS>
the
shawl
and
the
clean
cap
 
but
the
coat
,
and
the
close
-
shorn
,
dark
head
of
a
man
.
<EOS>
this
person
occupy
my
chair
;
his
olive
hand
hold
my
desk
open
,
his
nose
be
lose
to
view
amongst
my
paper
.
<EOS>
His
back
be
towards
me
,
but
there
could
not
be
a
moment
's
question
about
identity
.
<EOS>
already
be
the
attire
of
ceremony
discard
:
the
cherished
and
ink
-
stain
paletôt
be
resume
;
the
perverse
bonnet
-
grec
lie
on
the
floor
,
as
if
just
drop
from
the
hand
,
culpably
busy
.
  
<EOS>
now
I
know
,
and
I
have
long
know
,
that
that
hand
of
M.
Emanuel
's
be
on
the
most
intimate
term
with
my
desk
;
that
it
raise
and
lower
the
lid
,
ransack
and
arrange
the
content
,
almost
as
familiarly
as
my
own
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
not
dubious
,
nor
do
he
wish
it
to
be
so
<EOS>
:
he
leave
sign
of
each
visit
palpable
and
unmistakable
;
hitherto
,
however
,
I
have
never
catch
him
in
the
act
<EOS>
:
watch
as
I
would
,
I
could
not
detect
the
hour
and
moment
of
his
come
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
brownie
's
work
in
exercise
leave
overnight
full
of
fault
,
and
find
next
morning
carefully
correct
:
I
profit
by
his
capricious
good
-
will
in
loan
full
welcome
and
refreshing
.
<EOS>
between
a
sallow
dictionary
and
wear
-
out
grammar
would
magically
grow
a
fresh
interesting
new
work
,
or
a
classic
,
mellow
and
sweet
in
its
ripe
age
.
<EOS>
out
of
my
work
-
basket
would
laughingly
peep
a
romance
,
under
it
would
lurk
the
pamphlet
,
the
magazine
,
whence
last
evening
's
reading
have
be
extract
.
<EOS>
impossible
to
doubt
the
source
whence
these
treasure
flow
:
have
there
be
no
other
indication
,
one
condemning
and
traitor
peculiarity
,
common
to
them
all
,
settle
the
question
 
_
<EOS>
they
smell
of
cigars
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
this
be
very
shocking
,
of
course
:
_
<EOS>
I
_
think
so
at
first
,
and
use
to
open
the
window
with
some
bustle
,
to
air
my
desk
,
and
with
fastidious
finger
and
thumb
,
to
hold
the
peccant
brochure
forth
to
the
purifying
breeze
.
<EOS>
I
be
cure
of
that
formality
suddenly
.
<EOS>
monsieur
catch
me
at
it
one
day
,
understand
the
inference
,
instantly
relieve
my
hand
of
its
burden
,
and
,
in
another
moment
,
would
have
thrust
the
same
into
the
glowing
stove
.
<EOS>
It
chance
to
be
a
book
,
on
the
perusal
of
which
I
be
bent
;
so
<EOS>
for
once
I
prove
as
decide
and
quick
than
himself
;
recapture
the
spoil
,
and
 
have
save
this
volume
 
never
hazard
a
second
.
<EOS>
with
all
this
,
I
have
never
yet
be
able
to
arrest
in
his
visit
the
freakish
,
friendly
,
cigar
-
love
phantom
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
at
last
I
have
him
:
there
he
be
 
the
very
brownie
himself
;
and
there
,
curl
from
his
lip
,
be
the
pale
blue
breath
of
his
indian
darling
:
he
be
smoke
into
my
desk
:
it
may
well
betray
him
.
<EOS>
provoke
at
this
particular
,
and
yet
please
to
surprise
him
 
pleased
,
that
is
,
with
the
mixed
feeling
of
the
housewife
who
discover
at
last
her
strange
elfin
ally
busy
in
the
dairy
at
the
untimely
churn
 
I
softly
steal
forward
,
stand
behind
him
,
bent
with
precaution
over
his
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
My
heart
smote
me
to
see
that
 
after
this
morning
's
hostility
,
after
my
seeming
remissness
,
after
the
puncture
experience
by
his
feeling
,
and
the
ruffling
undergo
by
his
temper
 
he
,
all
willing
to
forget
and
forgive
,
have
bring
me
a
couple
of
handsome
volume
,
of
which
the
title
and
authorship
be
guarantee
for
interest
.
<EOS>
now
,
as
he
sit
bend
above
the
desk
,
he
be
stir
up
its
content
;
but
with
gentle
and
careful
hand
;
disarranging
indeed
,
but
not
harm
.
<EOS>
My
heart
smite
me
:
<EOS>
as
I
bend
over
him
,
as
he
sit
unconscious
,
do
me
what
good
he
could
,
and
I
daresay
not
feel
towards
me
unkindly
,
my
morning
's
anger
quite
melted
:
I
do
not
dislike
Professor
Emanuel
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
he
hear
me
breathe
.
<EOS>
He
turn
suddenly
:
his
temperament
be
nervous
,
yet
he
never
start
,
and
seldom
change
colour
:
there
be
something
hardy
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
be
go
into
town
with
the
other
teacher
,
"
say
he
,
take
a
grim
gripe
of
his
self

possession
,
which
half

escape
him

It
be
as
well
you
be

They

why

a

would

because

can
not

<EOS>
this
morning

he
continue
,
"
I
awoke
in
a
bright
mood

lay
out

<EOS>

I
do
know

It
be

at

Paul
Carl

<EOS>
than
smile
an
interest
,
look
an
affection

and
be
false

cold
at
heart
.
<EOS>
false
and
cold
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
you
be
;
but
you
have
make
a
great
mistake
in
life
,
that
I
believe
<EOS>
;
I
think
your
judgment
be
warped
 
that
you
be
indifferent
where
you
ought
to
be
grateful
 
and
perhaps
devote
and
infatuate
,
where
you
ought
to
be
cool
as
your
name
.
<EOS>
do
not
suppose
that
I
wish
you
to
have
a
passion
for
me
,
Mademoiselle
;
Dieu
vous
en
garde
!
<EOS>
what
do
you
start
for
?
<EOS>
because
I
say
passion
?
<EOS>
well
,
I
say
it
again
.
<EOS>
there
be
such
a
word
,
and
there
be
such
a
thing
 
though
not
within
these
wall
,
thank
heaven
!
<EOS>
You
be
no
child
that
one
should
not
speak
of
what
exist
;
but
I
only
utter
the
word
 
the
thing
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
be
alien
to
my
whole
life
and
view
.
<EOS>
It
die
in
the
past
 
in
the
present
<EOS>
it
lie
bury
 
<EOS>
its
grave
be
deep
-
dug
,
well
-
heap
,
and
many
winter
old
:
in
the
future
there
will
be
a
resurrection
,
as
I
believe
to
my
souls
consolation
;
but
all
will
then
be
change
 
form
and
feeling
:
the
mortal
will
have
put
on
immortality
 
it
will
rise
,
not
for
earth
,
but
heaven
.
<EOS>
all
I
say
to
_
you
_
,
Miss
Lucy
Snowe
,
be
 
that
you
ought
to
treat
Professor
Paul
Emanuel
decently

offering

<EOS>
"
You
will
be
like
me

Monsieur

this
cost
more
than
a

centime
,

I
do
not

its
price
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
take
from
the
open
desk
the
little
box
,
I
put
it
into
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
lie
ready

morning

I
continue

too

should
have
give
it
then

<EOS>
He
look
at
the
box
:
I
see
its
clear
warm
tint
and
bright
azure
circlet
,
please
his
eye

<EOS>
I
tell
him
to
open
it

My

Carl
David

"
a
little
bird
,
Monsieur
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
it
fly
from

then
one
can
tie
a
message
under

wing

needful

"
,
  
<EOS>
He
take
out
the
chain
 
a
trifle
indeed
as
to
value
,
but
glossy
with
silk
and
sparkle
with
bead
.
<EOS>
He
like
that
too
 
admire
it
artlessly
,
like
a
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
for
me

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

for
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
the
thing
you
be
work
at
last
night
?

"
the
same
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
finish
it
this
morning
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
commence
it
with
the
intention
that
it
should
be
mine
?
"
  
"
undoubtedly
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
offer
on
my
fête
-
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
purpose
continue
as
you
wove
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
again
I
assent
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
it
be
not
necessary
that
I
should
cut
out
any
portion
 
<EOS>
say
,
this
part
be
not
mine
:
it
be
plait
under
the
idea
and
for
the
adornment
of
another
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
by
no
mean
.
<EOS>
It
be
neither
necessary
,
nor
would
it
be
just
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
object
be
_
all
_
mine
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
object
be
yours
entirely
.
"
  
<EOS>
Straightway
Monsieur
open
his
paletôt
,
arrange
the
guard
splendidly
across
his
chest
,
display
as
much
and
suppressing
as
little
as
he
could
:
for
he
have
no
notion
of
conceal
what
he
admire
and
think
decorative
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
box
,
he
pronounce
it
a
superb
bonbonnière
 
<EOS>
he
be
fond
of
bonbon
,
by
the
way
 
<EOS>
and
as
he
always
like
to
share
with
other
what
please
himself
,
he
would
give
his
"
dragées
"
as
freely
as
he
lend
his
book
.
<EOS>
amongst
the
kind
brownie
's
gift
leave
in
my
desk
,
I
forgot
to
enumerate
many
a
paper
of
chocolate
comfit
.
<EOS>
His
taste
in
these
matter
be
southern
,
and
what
we
think
infantine
.
<EOS>
His
simple
lunch
consist
frequently
of
a
"
brioche
,
"
<EOS>
which
,
as
often
as
not
,
to
share
with
some
child
of
the
third
division
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
présent
c'est
un
fait
accompli
,
"
say
he
,
re
-
adjust
his
paletôt
;
and
we
have
no
more
word
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
after
look
over
the
two
volume
he
have
bring
,
and
cut
away
some
page
with
his
penknife
(
he
generally
prune
before
lend
his
book
,
especially
if
they
be
novel
,
and
sometimes
I
be
a
little
provoke
at
the
severity
of
his
censorship
,
the
retrenchment
interrupt
the
narrative
)
,
he
rise
,
politely
touch
his
bonnet
-
grec
,
and
bid
me
a
civil
good
-
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
friend
now
,
"
think
I
,
"
till
the
next
time
we
quarrel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
_
may
_
have
quarrel
again
that
very
same
evening
,
but
,
wonderful
to
relate
,
fail
,
for
once
,
to
make
the
most
of
our
opportunity
.
  
<EOS>
Contrary
to
all
expectation
,
M.
Paul
arrive
at
the
study
-
hour
.
<EOS>
have
see
so
much
of
him
in
the
morning
,
we
do
not
look
for
his
presence
at
night
.
<EOS>
no
sooner
be
we
seat
at
lesson
,
however
,
than
he
appear
.
<EOS>
I
own
I
be
glad
to
see
him
,
so
glad
that
I
could
not
help
greet
his
arrival
with
a
smile
;
and
when
he
make
his
way
to
the
same
seat
about
which
so
serious
a
misunderstanding
have
formerly
arise
,
I
take
good
care
not
to
make
too
much
room
for
him
;
he
watch
with
a
jealous
,
side
-
long
look
,
to
see
whether
I
shrink
away
,
but
I
do
not
,
though
the
bench
be
a
little
crowded
.
<EOS>
I
be
lose
the
early
impulse
to
recoil
from
M.
Paul
.
<EOS>
habituate
to
the
paletôt
and
bonnet
-
grec
,
the
neighbourhood
of
these
garment
seem
no
longer
uncomfortable
or
very
formidable
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
now
sit
restrained
,
"
asphyxiée
"
(
as
he
use
to
say
)
at
his
side
<EOS>
;
I
stir
when
I
wish
to
stir
,
cough
when
it
be
necessary
,
even
yawn
when
I
be
tired
 
<EOS>
do
,
in
short
,
what
I
please
,
blindly
reliant
upon
his
indulgence
.
<EOS>
nor
do
my
temerity
,
this
evening
at
least
,
meet
the
punishment
it
perhaps
merit
;
he
be
both
indulgent
and
good
-
natured
;
not
a
cross
glance
shoot
from
his
eye
,
not
a
hasty
word
leave
his
lip
.
<EOS>
till
the
very
close
of
the
evening
,
he
do
not
indeed
address
me
at
all
,
yet
I
feel
,
somehow
,
that
he
be
full
of
friendliness
.
<EOS>
silence
be
of
different
kind
,
and
breathe
different
meaning
;
no
word
could
inspire
a
pleasanter
content
than
do
M.
Paul
's
worldless
presence
.
<EOS>
when
the
tray
come
in
,
and
the
bustle
of
supper
commence
,
he
just
say
,
as
he
retire
,
that
he
wish
me
a
good
night
and
sweet
dream
;
and
a
good
night
and
sweet
dream
<EOS>
I
have
.
    
<EOS>
M.
PAUL
.
  
<EOS>
yet
the
reader
be
advise
not
to
be
in
any
hurry
with
his
kindly
conclusion
,
or
to
suppose
,
with
an
over
-
hasty
charity
,
that
from
that
day
M.
Paul
become
a
change
character
 
easy
to
live
with
,
and
no
longer
apt
to
flash
danger
and
discomfort
round
him
.
  
<EOS>
no
;
he
be
naturally
a
little
man
of
unreasonable
mood
.
<EOS>
when
over
-
wrought
,
which
he
often
be
,
he
become
acutely
irritable
;
and
,
besides
,
his
vein
be
dark
with
a
livid
belladonna
tincture
,
the
essence
of
jealousy
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
merely
the
tender
jealousy
of
the
heart
,
but
that
sterner
,
narrow
sentiment
whose
seat
be
in
the
head
.
  
<EOS>
I
use
to
think
,
as
I
Sat
look
at
M.
Paul
,
while
he
be
knit
his
brow
or
protrude
his
lip
over
some
exercise
of
mine
,
which
have
not
as
many
fault
as
he
wish
<EOS>
(
for
he
like
me
to
commit
fault
:
a
knot
of
blunder
be
sweet
to
him
as
a
cluster
of
nut
)
,
that
he
have
point
of
resemblance
to
Napoleon
Bonaparte
.
<EOS>
I
think
so
still
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
shameless
disregard
of
magnanimity
,
he
resemble
the
great
Emperor
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
would
have
quarrel
with
twenty
learned
woman
,
would
have
unblushingly
carry
on
a
system
of
petty
bickering
and
recrimination
with
a
whole
capital
of
coterie
,
never
trouble
himself
about
loss
or
lack
of
dignity
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
exile
fifty
Madame
de
Staëls
,
if
,
they
have
annoy
,
offend
,
outrivalle
,
or
oppose
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
well
remember
a
hot
episode
of
his
with
a
certain
Madame
Panache
 
<EOS>
a
lady
temporarily
employ
by
Madame
Beck
to
give
lesson
in
history
.
<EOS>
She
be
clever
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
she
know
a
good
deal
;
and
,
besides
,
thoroughly
possess
the
art
of
make
the
most
of
what
she
know
;
of
word
and
confidence
she
hold
unlimited
command
.
<EOS>
Her
personal
appearance
be
far
from
destitute
of
advantage
;
I
believe
many
people
would
have
pronounce
her
"
a
fine
woman
;
"
and
yet
there
be
point
in
her
robust
and
ample
attraction
,
as
well
as
in
her
bustling
and
demonstrative
presence
,
which
,
it
appear
,
the
nice
and
capricious
taste
of
M.
Paul
could
not
away
with
.
<EOS>
the
sound
of
her
voice
,
echo
through
the
carré
,
would
put
him
into
a
strange
taking
;
her
long
free
step
 
<EOS>
almost
stride
 
along
the
corridor
,
would
often
make
him
snatch
up
his
paper
and
decamp
on
the
instant
.
  
<EOS>
with
malicious
intent
he
bethink
himself
,
one
day
,
to
intrude
on
her
class
;
as
quick
as
lightning
he
gather
her
method
of
instruction
;
it
differ
from
a
pet
plan
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
with
little
ceremony
,
and
less
courtesy
,
he
point
out
what
he
term
her
error
.
<EOS>
whether
he
expect
submission
and
attention
,
I
know
not
;
he
meet
an
acrid
opposition
,
accompany
by
a
round
reprimand
for
his
certainly
unjustifiable
interference
.
  
<EOS>
instead
of
withdraw
with
dignity
,
as
he
may
still
have
do
,
he
throw
down
the
gauntlet
of
defiance
.
<EOS>
Madame
Panache
,
bellicose
as
a
Penthesilea
,
pick
it
up
in
a
minute
.
<EOS>
She
snap
her
finger
in
the
intermeddler
's
face
;
she
rush
upon
him
with
a
storm
of
word
.
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
be
eloquent
;
but
Madame
Panache
be
voluble
.
<EOS>
a
system
of
fierce
antagonism
ensue
.
<EOS>
instead
of
laugh
in
his
sleeve
at
his
fair
foe
,
with
all
her
sore
amour
-
propre
and
loud
self
-
assertion
,
M.
Paul
detest
her
with
intense
seriousness
;
he
honour
her
with
his
earnest
fury
;
he
pursue
her
vindictively
and
implacably
,
refuse
to
rest
peaceably
in
his
bed
,
to
derive
due
benefit
from
his
meal
,
or
even
serenely
to
relish
his
cigar
,
till
she
be
fairly
root
out
of
the
establishment
.
<EOS>
the
Professor
conquer
,
but
I
can
not
say
that
the
laurel
of
this
victory
shadow
gracefully
his
temple
.
<EOS>
once
I
venture
to
hint
as
much
.
<EOS>
to
my
great
surprise
he
allow
that
I
may
be
right
,
but
aver
that
when
bring
into
contact
with
either
man
or
woman
of
the
coarse
,
self
-
complacent
quality
,
whereof
Madame
Panache
be
a
speciman
,
he
have
no
control
over
his
own
passion
;
an
unspeakable
and
active
aversion
impel
him
to
a
war
of
extermination
.
  
<EOS>
three
month
afterwards
,
hear
that
his
vanquish
foe
have
meet
with
reverse
,
and
be
likely
to
be
really
distressed
for
want
of
employment
,
he
forget
his
hatred
,
and
alike
active
in
good
and
evil
,
he
move
heaven
and
earth
till
he
find
her
a
place
.
<EOS>
upon
her
come
to
make
up
former
difference
,
and
thank
him
for
his
recent
kindness
,
the
old
voice
 
a
little
loud
 
<EOS>
the
old
manner
 
a
little
forward
 
so
act
upon
him
that
in
ten
minute
he
start
up
and
bow
her
,
or
rather
himself
,
out
of
the
room
,
in
a
transport
of
nervous
irritation
.
  
<EOS>
to
pursue
a
somewhat
audacious
parallel
,
in
a
love
of
power
,
in
an
eager
grasp
after
supremacy
,
M.
Emanuel
be
like
Bonaparte
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
not
always
to
be
submit
to
.
<EOS>
sometimes
it
be
needful
to
resist
;
it
be
right
to
stand
still
,
to
look
up
into
his
eye
and
tell
him
that
his
requirement
go
beyond
reason
 
that
his
absolutism
verge
on
tyranny
.
  
<EOS>
the
dawning
,
the
first
development
of
peculiar
talent
appear
within
his
range
,
and
under
his
rule
,
curiously
excited
,
even
disturb
him
.
<EOS>
He
watch
its
struggle
into
life
with
a
scowl
;
he
hold
back
his
hand
 
perhaps
say
,
"
come
on
if
you
have
strength
,
"
but
would
not
aid
the
birth
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
pang
and
peril
of
the
first
conflict
be
over
,
when
the
breath
of
life
be
draw
,
when
he
see
the
lung
expand
and
contract
,
when
he
feel
the
heart
beat
and
discover
life
in
the
eye
,
he
do
not
yet
offer
to
foster
.
  
<EOS>
"
prove
yourself
true
ere
<EOS>
I
cherish
you
<EOS>
,
"
be
his
ordinance
;
and
how
difficult
he
make
that
proof
!
<EOS>
what
thorn
and
brier
,
what
flint
,
he
strew
in
the
path
of
foot
not
inure
to
rough
travel
!
<EOS>
He
watch
tearlessly
 
ordeal
that
he
exact
should
be
pass
through
 
fearlessly
.
<EOS>
He
follow
footprint
that
,
as
they
approach
the
bourne
,
be
sometimes
mark
in
blood
 
follow
them
grimly
,
hold
the
austere
police
-
watch
over
the
pain
-
press
pilgrim
.
<EOS>
and
when
at
last
he
allow
a
rest
,
before
slumber
may
close
the
eyelid
,
he
open
those
same
lid
wide
,
with
pitiless
finger
and
thumb
,
and
gaze
deep
through
the
pupil
and
the
irid
into
the
brain
,
into
the
heart
,
to
search
if
vanity
,
or
pride
,
or
Falsehood
,
in
any
of
its
subtle
form
,
be
discoverable
in
the
furth
recess
of
existence
.
<EOS>
if
,
at
last
,
he
let
the
neophyte
sleep
,
it
be
but
a
moment
;
he
wake
him
suddenly
up
to
apply
new
test
:
he
send
him
on
irksome
errand
when
he
be
stagger
with
weariness
;
he
try
the
temper
,
the
sense
,
and
the
health
;
and
it
be
only
when
every
severest
test
have
be
apply
and
endure
,
when
the
most
corrosive
aquafortis
have
be
use
,
and
fail
to
tarnish
the
ore
,
that
he
admit
it
genuine
,
and
,
still
in
clouded
silence
,
stamp
it
with
his
deep
brand
of
approval
.
  
<EOS>
I
speak
not
ignorant
of
these
evil
.
  
<EOS>
till
the
date
at
which
the
last
chapter
close
,
M.
Paul
have
not
be
my
professor
 
<EOS>
he
have
not
give
me
lesson
,
but
about
that
time
,
accidentally
hear
me
one
day
acknowledge
an
ignorance
of
some
branch
of
education
<EOS>
(
I
think
it
be
arithmetic
)
,
which
would
have
disgrace
a
charity
-
school
boy
,
as
he
very
truly
remark
,
he
take
me
in
hand
,
examine
me
first
,
find
me
,
I
need
not
say
,
abundantly
deficient
,
give
me
some
book
and
appoint
me
some
task
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
this
at
first
with
pleasure
,
indeed
with
unconcealed
exultation
,
condescend
to
say
that
he
believe
I
be
"
bonne
et
pas
trop
faible
"
(
i.e.
well
enough
disposed
,
and
not
wholly
destitute
of
part
)
,
but
,
owe
he
suppose
to
adverse
circumstance
,
"
as
yet
in
a
state
of
wretchedly
imperfect
mental
development
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
beginning
of
all
effort
have
indeed
with
me
be
mark
by
a
preternatural
imbecility
.
<EOS>
I
never
could
,
even
in
form
a
common
acquaintance
,
assert
or
prove
a
claim
to
average
quickness
.
<EOS>
a
depressing
and
difficult
passage
have
preface
every
new
page
I
have
turn
in
life
.
  
<EOS>
so
long
as
this
passage
last
,
M.
Paul
be
very
kind
,
very
good
,
<EOS>
very
forbearing
;
he
see
the
sharp
pain
inflict
,
and
feel
the
weighty
humiliation
impose
by
my
own
sense
of
incapacity
;
and
word
can
hardly
do
justice
to
his
tenderness
and
helpfulness
.
<EOS>
His
own
eye
would
moisten
,
when
tear
of
shame
and
effort
cloud
mine
;
burden
as
he
be
with
work
,
he
would
steal
half
his
brief
space
of
recreation
to
give
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
strange
grief
!
<EOS>
when
that
heavy
and
overcast
dawn
begin
at
last
to
yield
to
day
;
when
my
faculty
begin
to
struggle
themselves
,
free
,
and
my
time
of
energy
and
fulfilment
come
;
when
I
voluntarily
double
,
treble
,
quadruple
the
task
he
set
,
to
please
him
as
I
think
,
his
kindness
become
sternness
;
the
light
change
in
his
eye
from
a
beam
to
a
spark
<EOS>
;
he
fret
,
he
oppose
,
he
curb
me
imperiously
;
the
more
I
do
,
the
harder
I
work
,
the
less
he
seem
content
.
<EOS>
sarcasm
of
which
the
severity
amazed
and
puzzle
me
,
harass
my
ear
;
then
flow
out
the
bitter
inuendoe
against
the
"
pride
of
intellect
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
vaguely
threaten
with
I
know
not
what
doom
,
if
I
ever
trespass
the
limit
proper
to
my
sex
,
and
conceive
a
contraband
appetite
for
unfeminine
knowledge
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
I
have
no
such
appetite
.
<EOS>
what
I
love
,
it
joy
me
by
any
effort
to
content
;
but
the
noble
hunger
for
science
in
the
abstract
 
the
godlike
thirst
after
discovery
 
<EOS>
these
feeling
be
know
to
me
but
by
briefest
flash
.
  
<EOS>
yet
,
when
M.
Paul
sneer
at
me
,
I
want
to
possess
them
more
fully
;
<EOS>
his
injustice
stir
in
me
ambitious
wish
 
it
impart
a
strong
stimulus
 
<EOS>
it
give
wing
to
aspiration
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
beginning
,
before
I
have
penetrate
to
motive
,
that
uncomprehended
sneer
of
his
make
my
heart
ache
,
but
by
-
and
-
<EOS>
by
it
only
warm
the
blood
in
my
vein
,
and
send
add
action
to
my
pulse
.
<EOS>
whatever
my
power
 
feminine
or
the
contrary
 
<EOS>
God
have
give
them
,
and
I
feel
resolute
to
be
ashamed
of
no
faculty
of
his
bestowal
.
  
<EOS>
the
combat
be
very
sharp
for
a
time
.
<EOS>
I
seem
to
have
lose
M.
Paul
's
affection
;
he
treat
me
strangely
.
<EOS>
in
his
most
unjust
moment
he
would
insinuate
that
I
have
deceive
him
when
I
appear
,
what
he
call
"
faible
"
 
that
be
incompetent
;
he
say
I
have
feign
a
false
incapacity
.
<EOS>
again
,
he
would
turn
suddenly
round
and
accuse
me
of
the
most
far
-
fetched
imitation
and
impossible
plagiarism
,
assert
that
I
have
extract
the
pith
out
of
book
I
have
not
so
much
as
hear
of
 
and
over
the
perusal
of
which
I
should
infallibly
have
fall
down
in
a
sleep
as
deep
as
that
of
Eutychus
.
  
<EOS>
once
,
upon
his
prefer
such
an
accusation
,
I
turn
upon
him
 
I
rise
against
him
.
<EOS>
gather
an
armful
of
his
book
out
of
my
desk
,
I
fill
my
apron
and
pour
them
in
a
heap
upon
his
estrade
,
at
his
foot
.
  
<EOS>
"
take
them
away
,
M.
Paul
,
"
I
say
,
"
and
teach
me
no
more
.
<EOS>
I
never
ask
to
be
make
learn
,
and
you
compel
me
to
feel
very
profoundly
that
learning
be
not
happiness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
return
to
my
desk
,
I
lay
my
head
on
my
arm
,
nor
would
I
speak
to
him
for
two
day
afterwards
.
<EOS>
He
pain
and
chagrin
me
.
<EOS>
His
affection
have
be
very
sweet
and
dear
 
a
pleasure
new
and
incomparable
:
now
that

the

away
;
they
be
all
restore
with
careful
hand
to
their
place
,
and
he
come
as
usual
to
teach
me
.
<EOS>
He
make
his
peace
somehow
 
too
readily
,
perhaps
:
I
ought
to
have
stand
out
longer
,
but
when
he
look
kind
and
good
,
and
hold
out
his
hand
with
amity
,
memory
refuse
to
reproduce
with
due
force
his
oppressive
moment
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
reconcilement
be
always
sweet
!
  
<EOS>
on
a
certain
morning
a
message
come
from
my
godmother
,
invite
me
to
attend
some
notable
lecture
to
be
deliver
in
the
same
public
room
before
describe
.
<EOS>
Dr.
John
have
bring
the
message
himself
,
and
deliver
it
verbally
to
Rosine
,
who
have
not
scruple
to
follow
the
step
of
M.
Emanuel
,
then
pass
to
the
first
classe
,
and
,
in
his
presence
,
stand
"
carrément
"
before
my
desk
,
hand
in
apron
-
pocket
,
and
rehearse
the
same
,
saucily
and
aloud
,
conclude
with
the
word
,
"
Qu'il
est
vraiment
beau
,
Mademoiselle
,
ce
jeune
docteur
!
<EOS>
Quels

<EOS>
quel

<EOS>
Tenez

<EOS>
J'en

"
  
<EOS>
when
she
be
go
,
my
professor
demand
of
me
why
I
suffer
"
cette
fille
effrontée
,
cette
créature
san
pudeur
,
"
to
address
me
in
such
term
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
no
pacifying
answer
to
give
.
<EOS>
the
term
be
precisely
such
as
Rosine
 
a
young
lady
in
whose
skull
the
organ
of
reverence
and
reserve
be
not
largely
develop
 
be
in
the
constant
habit
of
use
.
<EOS>
besides
,
what
she
say
about
the
young
doctor
be
true
enough
.
<EOS>
Graham
_
be

handsome
;
he
have
fine
eye
and
a
thrilling

glance
.
<EOS>
an
observation
to
that
effect
actually
form
itself
into
sound
on
my
lip

<EOS>
"
Elle

I
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah

vous

"
  
<EOS>
"
Mais

"
  
<EOS>
the
lesson
to
which
we
have
that
day
to
submit
be
such
as
to
make
us
very
glad
when
it
terminate
.
<EOS>
at
its
close
,
the
release
,
pupil
rush
out
,
half
-
tremble
,
half
-
exultant
.
<EOS>
I
,
too
,
be
go
.
<EOS>
a
mandate
to
remain
arrest
me
.
<EOS>
I
mutter
that
I
want
some
fresh
air
sadly
 
<EOS>
the
stove
be
in
a
glow
,
the
classe
over
-
heat
.
<EOS>
an
inexorable
voice
merely
recommend
silence
;
and
this
salamander
 
for
whom
no
room
ever
seem
too
hot
 
sit
down
between
my
desk
and
the
stove
 
a
situation
in
which
he
ought
to
have
feel
broil
,
but
do
not
 
proceed
to
confront
me
with
 
a
greek
quotation
!
  
<EOS>
in
M.
Emanuel
's
soul
rankle
a
chronic
suspicion
that
I
know
both
Greek
and
Latin
.
<EOS>
as
monkey
be
say
to
have
the
power
of
speech
if
they
would
but
use
it
,
and
be
report
to
conceal
this
faculty
in
fear
of
its
be
turn
to
their
detriment
,
so
to
me
be
ascribe
a
fund
of
knowledge
which
I
be
suppose
criminally
and
craftily
to
conceal
.
<EOS>
the
privilege
of
a
"
classical
education
,
"
it
be
insinuate
,
have
be
mine
;
on
flower
of
Hymettus
I
have
revel
;
a
golden
store
,
hive
in
memory
,
now
silently
sustain
my
effort
,
and
privily
nurture
my
wit
.
  
<EOS>
a
hundred
expedient
do
M.
Paul
employ
to
surprise
my
secret
 
to
wheedle
,
to
threaten
,
to
startle
it
out
of
me
.
<EOS>
sometimes
he
place
Greek
and
latin
book
in
my
way
,
and
then
watch
me
,
as
Joan
of
Arc
's
jailor
tempt
her
with
the
warrior
's
accoutrement
,
and
lie
in
wait
for
the
issue
.
<EOS>
again
he
quote
I
know
not
<EOS>
what
author
and
passage
,
and
while
roll
out
their
sweet
and
sound
line
<EOS>
(
the
classic
tone
fall
musically
from
his
lip
 
for
he
have
a
good
voice
 
remarkable
for
compass
,
modulation
,
and
matchless
expression
)
,
he
would
fix
on
me
a
vigilant
,
pierce
,
and
often
malicious
eye
.
<EOS>
It
be
evident
he
sometimes
expect
great
demonstration
;
they
never
occur
,
however
;
not
comprehend
,
of
course
I
could
neither
be
charm
nor
annoy
.
  
<EOS>
baffle
 
almost
angry
 
he
still
cling
to
his
fix
idea
;
my
susceptibility
be
pronounce
marble
 
<EOS>
my
face
a
mask
.
<EOS>
It
appear
as
if
he
could
not
be
bring
to
accept
the
homely
truth
,
and
take
me
for
what
I
be
:
man
,
and
woman
too
,
must
have
delusion
of
some
sort
;
if
not
make
ready
to
their
hand
,
they
will
invent
exaggeration
for
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
at
moment
I
_
do
_
wish
that
his
suspicion
have
be
better
found
.
<EOS>
there
be
time
when
I
would
have
give
my
right
hand
to
possess
the
treasure
he
ascribe
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
deserve
condign
punishment
for
his
testy
crotchet
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
glory
in
bring
home
to
him
his
bad
apprehension
astoundingly
realize
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
exult
to
burst
on
his
vision
,
confront
and
confound
his
"
lunette
,
"
one
blaze
of
acquirement
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
why
do
nobody
undertake
to
make
me
clever
while
I
be
young
enough
to
learn
,
that
I
may
,
by
one
grand
,
sudden
,
inhuman
revelation
 
<EOS>
one
cold
,
cruel
,
overwhelming
triumph
 
<EOS>
have
for
ever
crush
the
mock
spirit
out
of
Paul
Carl
David
Emanuel
!
  
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
no
such
feat
be
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
to
-
day
,
as
usual
,
his
quotation
fall
ineffectual
:
he
soon
shift
his
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
woman
of
intellect
"
be
his
next
theme
:
here
he
be
at
home
.
<EOS>
a
"
woman
of
intellect
,
"
it
appear
,
be
a
sort
of
"
lusus
naturae
,
"
a
luckless
accident
,
a
thing
for
which
there
be
neither
place
nor
use
in
creation
,
want
neither
as
wife
nor
worker
.
<EOS>
Beauty
anticipate
her
in
the
first
office
.
<EOS>
He
believe
in
his
soul
that
lovely
,
placid
,
and
passive
feminine
mediocrity
be
the
only
pillow
on
which
manly
think
and
sense
could
find
rest
for
its
ache
temple
;
and
as
to
work
,
male
mind
alone
could
work
to
any
good
practical
result
 
hein
?
  
<EOS>
this
"
hein
?
"
be
a
note
of
interrogation
intend
to
draw
from
me
contradiction
or
objection
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
only
say
 
"
<EOS>
Cela

ne
me
<EOS>

ne
m'en

and
presently
add
 
"
May
I
go
,
Monsieur

<EOS>
They
have
ring
the
bell
for
the
second

(
_
i.e.
_
luncheon

.
  
<EOS>
"
what
of

<EOS>
You
be
not

?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
be
,
"
I
say
;
"
I
have
have
nothing
since
breakfast
,
at
seven
,
and
should
have
nothing
till
dinner
,
at
five

I
miss
this
bell

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
he
be
in
the

plight
,
but
I
may
share
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
he
break
in
two
the
"
brioche
"
intend
for
his
own
refreshment
,
and
give
me
half
.
<EOS>
truly
his
bark
be
bad
than
his
bite
;
but
the
really
formidable
attack
be
yet
to
come
.
<EOS>
while
eat
his
cake
,
I
could
not
forbear
express
my
secret
wish
that
I
really
know
all
of
which
he
accuse
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
I
sincerely
feel
myself
to
be
an
ignoramus
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
,
in
a
softened
tone
.
  
<EOS>
if
I
have
reply
meekly
by
an
unqualified
affirmative
,
I
believe
he
would
have
stretch
out
his
hand
,
and
we
should
have
be
friend
on
the
spot
,
but
I
answer
    
"
not
exactly
.
<EOS>
I
be
ignorant
,
Monsieur
,
in
the
knowledge
you
ascribe
to
me
,
but
I
_
sometimes
_
,
not
_
always
_
,
feel
a
knowledge
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
I
mean
?
<EOS>
"
he
inquire
,
sharply
.
  
<EOS>
unable
to
answer
this
question
in
a
breath
,
I
evade
it
by
change
of
subject
.
<EOS>
He
have
now
finish
his
half
of
the
brioche
feel
sure
that
on
so
trifle
a
fragment
he
could
not
have
satisfy
his
appetite
,
as
indeed
I
have
not
appease
mine
,
and
inhale
the
fragrance
of
baked
apple
afar
from
the
refectory
<EOS>
,
I
venture
to
inquire
whether
he
do
not
also
perceive
that
agreeable
odour
.
<EOS>
He
confess
that
he
do
.
<EOS>
I
say
if
he
would
let
me
out
by
the
garden
-
door
,
and
permit
me
just
to
run
across
the
court
,
I
would
fetch
him
a
plateful
;
and
add
that
I
believe
they
be
excellent
,
as
Goton
have
a
very
good
method
of
baking
,
or
rather
stew
fruit
,
put
in
a
little
spice
,
sugar
,
and
a
glass
or
two
of
vin
blanc
 
<EOS>
may
I
go
?
  
<EOS>
"
petite
gourmande
!
"
say
he
,
smile
,
"
I
have
not
forget
how
pleased
you
be
with
the
pâté
<EOS>
â
<EOS>
la
crême
<EOS>
I
once
give
you
,
and
you
know
very
well
,
at
this
moment
,
that
to
fetch
the
apple
for
me
will
be
the
same
as
get
them
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
go
,
then
,
but
come
back
quickly
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
at
last
he
liberate
me
on
parole
.
<EOS>
My
own
plan
be
to
go
and
return
with
speed
and
good
faith
,
to
put
the
plate
in
at
the
door
,
and
then
to
vanish
incontinent
,
leave
all
consequence
for
future
settlement
.
  
<EOS>
that
intolerably
keen
instinct
of
his
seem
to
have
anticipate
my
scheme
:
he
meet
me
at
the
threshold
,
hurry
me
into
the
room
,
and
fix
me
in
a
minute
in
my
former
seat
.
<EOS>
take
the
plate
of
fruit
from
my
hand
,
he
divide
the
portion
intend
only
for
himself
,
and
order
me
to
eat
my
share
.
<EOS>
I
comply
with
no
good
grace
,
and
vexed
,
I
suppose
,
by
my
reluctance
,
he
open
a
masked
and
dangerous
battery
.
<EOS>
all
he
have
yet
say
,
I
could
count
as
mere
sound
and
fury
,
signify
nothing
:
not
so
of
the
present
attack
.
  
<EOS>
It
consist
in
an
unreasonable
proposition
with
which
he
have
before
afflict
me
:
<EOS>
namely
,
that
on
the
next
public
examination
-
day
I
should
engage
 
foreigner
as
I
be
 
to
take
my
place
on
the
first
form
of
first
-
class
pupil
,
and
with
them
improvise
a
composition
in
French
,
on
any
subject
any
spectator
may
dictate
,
without
benefit
of
grammar
or
lexicon
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
what
the
result
of
such
an
experiment
would
be
.
<EOS>
I
,
to
whom
nature
have
deny
the
impromptu
faculty
;
who
,
in
public
,
be
by
nature
a
cypher
;
whose
time
of
mental
activity
,
even
when
alone
,
be
not
under
the
meridian
sun
;
who
need
the
fresh
silence
of
morning
,
or
the
recluse
peace
of
evening
,
to
win
from
the
Creative
Impulse
one
evidence
of
his
presence
,
one
proof
of
his
force
;
I
,
with
whom
that
Impulse
be
the
most
intractable
,
the
most
capricious
,
the
most
maddening
of
master
(
him
before
me
always
except
)
 
<EOS>
a
deity
which
sometimes
,
under
circumstance
 
apparently
propitious

would
not
speak
when
question
,
would
not
hear
when
appeal
to

would
not

when
seek
,
be
find

but
would
stand
,
all
cold
,
all
indurate
,
all
granite
,
a
dark
Baal
with
carven
lip
and
blank
eye
-
ball
,
and
breast
like
the
stone
face
of
a
tomb

and
again
,
suddenly
,
at
some
turn
,
some
sound
,
some
long
-
tremble
sob
of
the
wind
,
at
some
rush
past
of
an
unseen
stream
of
electricity
,
the
irrational
demon
would
wake
unsolicited
,
would
stir
strangely
alive
,
would
rush
from
its
pedestal
like
a
perturbed
Dagon
,
call
to
its
votary
for
a
sacrifice
,
whatever
the
hour
 
to
its
victim
for
some
blood
,
or
some
breath
,
<EOS>
whatever
the
circumstance
or
scene
 
rouse
its
priest
,
treacherously
promising
vaticination
,
perhaps
fill
its
temple
with
a
strange
hum
of
oracle
,
but
sure
to
give
half
the
significance
to
fateful
wind
,
and
grudge
to
the
desperate
listener
even
a
miserable
remnant
 
yield
it
sordidly
,
as
though
each
word
have
be
a
drop
of
the
deathless
ichor
of
its
own
dark
vein
.
<EOS>
and
this
tyrant
I
be
to
compel
into
bondage
,
and
make
it
improvise
a
theme
,
on
a
school
estrade
,
between
a
Mathilde
and
a
Coralie
,
under
the
eye
of
a
Madame
Beck
,
for
the
pleasure
,
and
to
the
inspiration
of
a
bourgeois
of
Labassecour
!
  
<EOS>
upon
this
argument
M.
Paul
and
I
do
battle
more
than
once
 
strong
battle
,
with
confused
noise
of
demand
and
rejection
,
exaction
and
repulse

<EOS>
on
this
particular

I
be
soundly

He
want
to
see

worst
<EOS>
(
I

,
and
one
minute
he
pause
to
take
breath

Would

never

He

then
(
with

sneer
 
<EOS>
M.
Paul
could
sneer
supremely

curl
his

open
his

his

there

He

with

Ere

<EOS>
one
Sunday
afternoon
,
have
walk
the
distance
of
half
a
league
to
the
protestant
church
,
I
come
back
weary
and
exhausted
;
and
take
refuge
in
my
solitary
sanctuary
,
the
first
classe
<EOS>
,
I
be
glad
to
sit
down
,
and
to
make
of
my
desk
a
pillow
for
my
arm
and
head
.
  
<EOS>
awhile
I
listen
to
the
lullaby
of
bee
hum
in
the
berceau
,
and
watch
,
through
the
glass
door
and
the
tender
,
lightly
-
strew
spring
foliage
,
Madame
Beck
and
a
gay
party
of
friend
,
whom
she
have
entertain
that
day
at
dinner
after
morning
mass
,
walk
in
the
centre
-
alley
under
orchard
bough
dress
at
this
season
in
blossom
,
and
wear
a
colouring
as
pure
and
warm
as
mountain
-
snow
at
sun
-
rise
.
  
<EOS>
My
principal
attraction
towards
this
group
of
guest
lie
,
I
remember
,
in
one
figure
 
that
of
a
handsome
young
girl
whom
I
have
see
before
as
a
visitor
at
Madame
Beck
's
,
and
of
whom
I
have
be
vaguely
tell
that
she
be
a
"
filleule
,
"
or
god
-
daughter
,
of
M.
Emanuel
's
,
and
that
between
her
mother
,
or
aunt
,
or
some
other
female
relation
of
hers
,
and
the
Professor
,
have
exist
of
old
a
special
friendship
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
be
not
of
the
holiday
band
to
-
day
,
but
I
have
see
this
young
girl
with
him
ere
now
,
and
as
far
as
distant
observation
could
enable
me
to
judge
,
she
seem
to
enjoy
him
with
the
frank
ease
of
a
ward
with
an
indulgent
guardian
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
her
run
up
to
him
,
put
her
arm
through
his
,
and
hang
upon
him
.
<EOS>
once
,
when
she
do
so
,
a
curious
sensation
have
strike
through
me
 
a
disagreeable
anticipatory
sensation
 
one
of
the
family
of
presentiment
,
I
suppose
 
<EOS>
but
I
refuse
to
analyze
or
dwell
upon
it
.
<EOS>
while
watch
this
girl
,
Mademoiselle
Sauveur
by
name
,
and
follow
the
gleam
of
her
bright
silk
robe
<EOS>
(
she
be
always
richly
dress
,
for
she
be
say
to
be
wealthy
)
through
the
flower
and
the
glance
leave
of
tender
emerald
,
my
eye
become
dazzled
 
<EOS>
they
close
;
my
lassitude
,
the
warmth
of
the
day
,
the
hum
of
bee
and
bird
,
all
lull
me
,
and
at
last
I
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
two
hour
stole
over
me
.
<EOS>
Ere
<EOS>
I
wake
,
the
sun
have
decline
out
of
sight
behind
the
tower
house
,
the
garden
and
the
room
be
grey
,
bee
have
go
homeward
,
and
the
flower
be
close
;
the
party
of
guest
,
too
,
have
vanish
;
each
alley
be
void
.
  
<EOS>
on
wake
,
I
feel
much
at
ease
 
not
chill
,
as
I
ought
to
have
be
after
sit
so
still
for
at
least
two
hour
;
my
cheek
and
arm
be
not
benumb
by
pressure
against
the
hard
desk
.
<EOS>
no
wonder
.
<EOS>
instead
of
the
bare
wood
on
which
I
have
lay
them
,
I
find
a
thick
shawl
,
carefully
fold
,
substitute
for
support
,
and
another
shawl
(
both
take
from
the
corridor
where
such
thing
hang
)
wrap
warmly
round
me
.
  
<EOS>
who
have
do
this
?
<EOS>
who
be
my
friend
?
<EOS>
which
of
the
teacher
?
<EOS>
which
of
the
pupil
?
<EOS>
none
,
except
St.
Pierre
,
be
inimical
to
me
;
but
which
of
them
have
the
art
,
the
thought
,
the
habit
,
of
benefit
thus
tenderly
?
<EOS>
which
of
them
have
a
step
so
quiet
,
a
hand
so
gentle
,
but
I
should
have
hear
or
feel
her
,
if
she
have
approach
or
touch
me
in
a
day
-
sleep
?
  
<EOS>
as
to
Ginevra
Fanshawe
,
that
bright
young
creature
be
not
gentle
at
all
,
and
would
certainly
have
pull
me
out
of
my
chair
,
if
she
have
meddle
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
I
say
at
last
:
"
It
be
Madame
Beck
's
do
;
she
have
come
in
,
see
me
asleep
,
and
think
I
may
take
cold
.
<EOS>
She
consider
me
a
useful
machine
,
answer
well
the
purpose
for
which
it
be
hire
;
so
would
not
have
me
needlessly
injure
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
"
methought
,
"
I
will
take
a
walk
;
the
evening
be
fresh
,
and
not
very
chill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
I
open
the
glass
door
and
step
into
the
berceau
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
to
my
own
alley
:
<EOS>
have
it
be
dark
,
or
even
dusk
,
I
should
have
hardly
venture
there
,
for
I
have
not
yet
forget
the
curious
illusion
of
vision
(
<EOS>
if
illusion
it
be
)
experience
in
that
place
some
month
ago
.
<EOS>
but
a
ray
of
the
set
sun
burnish
still
the
grey
crown
of
Jean
Baptiste
;
nor
have
all
the
bird
of
the
garden
yet
vanish
into
their
nest
amongst
the
tufte
shrub
and
thick
wall
-
ivy
.
<EOS>
I
pace
up
and
down
,
think
almost
the
same
thought
I
have
ponder
that
night
when
I
bury
my
glass
jar
 
<EOS>
how
I
should
make
some
advance
in
life
,
take
another
step
towards
an
independent
position
;
for
this
train
of
reflection
,
though
not
lately
pursue
,
have
never
by
me
be
wholly
abandon
;
and
whenever
a
certain
eye
be
avert
from
me
,
and
a
certain
countenance
grow
dark
with
unkindness
and
injustice
,
into
that
track
of
speculation
<EOS>
do
I
at
once
strike
;
so
that
,
little
by
little
,
I
have
lay
half
a
plan
.
  
<EOS>
"
living
cost
little
,
"
say
I
to
myself
,
"
in
this
economical
town
of
Villette
,
where
people
be
more
sensible
than
I
understand
they
be
in
dear
old
England
 
infinitely
less
worried
about
appearance
,
and
less
emulous
of
display
 
where
nobody
be
in
the
least
ashamed
to
be
quite
as
homely
and
save
as
he
find
convenient
.
<EOS>
house
-
rent
,
in
a
prudently
choose
situation
,
need
not
be
high
.
<EOS>
when
I
shall
have
save
one
thousand
franc
,
I
will
take
a
tenement
with
one
large
room
,
and
two
or
three
small
one
,
furnish
the
first
with
a
few
bench
and
desk
,
a
black
tableau
,
an
estrade
for
myself
;
upon
it
a
chair
and
table
,
with
a
sponge
and
some
white
chalk
;
begin
with
take
day
-
pupil
,
and
so
work
my
way
upwards
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
's
commencement
be
 
as
I
have
often
hear
her
say
 
from
no
high
starting
-
point
,
and
where
be
she
now
?
<EOS>
all
these
premise
and
this
garden
be
her
,
buy
with
her
money
;
she
have
a
competency
already
secure
for
old
age
,
and
a
flourish
establishment
under
her
direction
,
which
will
furnish
a
career
for
her
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
Courage
,
Lucy
Snowe
!
<EOS>
with
self
-
denial
and
economy
now
,
and
steady
exertion
by
-
and
-
by
,
an
object
in
life
nee
not
fail
you
.
<EOS>
venture
not
to
complain
that
such
an
object
be
too
selfish
,
too
limited
,
and
lack
interest
<EOS>
;
be
content
to
labour
for
independence
until
you
have
prove
,
by
win
that
prize
,
your
right
to
look
high
.
<EOS>
but
afterwards
,
be
there
nothing
more
for
me
in
life
 
<EOS>
no
true
home
 
<EOS>
nothing
to
be
dearer
to
me
than
myself
,
and
by
its
paramount
preciousness
,
to
draw
from
me
well
thing
than
I
care
to
culture
for
myself
only
?
<EOS>
nothing
,
at
whose
foot
I
can
willingly
lay
down
the
whole
burden
of
human
egotism
,
and
gloriously
take
up
the
noble
charge
of
labour
and
live
for

<EOS>
I
suppose
,
Lucy
Snowe
,
the
orb
of
your
life
be
not
to
be
so
round
:
for
you
,
the
crescent

phase
must
suffice

<EOS>
very
good
.
<EOS>
I
see
a
huge
mass
of
my
fellow
-
creature
in
no
well
circumstance

<EOS>
I
see
that
a
great
many
man
,
and
more
woman
,
hold
their
span
of
life
on
condition
of
denial
and
privation

<EOS>
I
find
no
reason
why
I
should
be
of

few
favour

<EOS>
I
believe
in
some
blending
of
hope
and
sunshine
sweeten
the
bad
lot
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
this
life
be
not
all
;
neither
the
beginning
nor
the
end

<EOS>
I
believe
while
I
tremble

I
trust
while
I
weep

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
this
subject
be
do
with
.
<EOS>
It
be
right
to
look
our
life
-
account
bravely
in
the
face
now
and
then
,
and
settle
them
honestly
.
<EOS>
and
he
be
a
poor
self

swindler
who
lie
to
himself
while
he
reckon
the
item
,
and
set
down
under
the
head
 
happiness
that
which
be
misery

<EOS>
call
anguish
 
anguish

and
despair
 
despair

write
both
down
in
strong
character
with
a
resolute
pen
:
you
will

pay
your
debt
to
Doom

<EOS>
falsify

insert

where
you
should
have
write
"
pain

"
and
see
if
your
mighty
creditor
will
allow
the
fraud
to
pass
,
or
accept
the
coin
with
which
you
would
cheat
him

offer

<EOS>
not
a

pale
sea

<EOS>
I
settle
another
account
.
  
<EOS>
pause
before
Methusaleh
 
the
giant
and
patriarch
of
the
garden
 
and
lean
my
brow
against
his
knotty
trunk
,
my
foot
rest
on
the
stone
seal
the
small
sepulchre
at
his
root
;
and
I
recall
the
passage
of
feeling
therein
bury
;
I
recall
Dr.
John
;
my
warm
affection
for
him
;
my
faith
in
his
excellence
;
my
delight
in
his
grace
.
<EOS>
what
be
become
of
that
curious
one
-
sided
friendship
which
be
half
marble
and
half
life
;
only
on
one
hand
truth
,
and
on
the
other
perhaps
a
jest
?
  
<EOS>
be
this
feeling
dead
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
,
but
it
be
bury
.
<EOS>
sometimes
I
think
the
tomb
unquiet
,
and
dream
strangely
of
disturb
earth
,
and
of
hair
,
still
golden
,
and
living
,
obtrude
through
coffin
-
chinks
.
  
<EOS>
have
I
be
too
hasty
?
<EOS>
I
use
to
ask
myself
;
and
this
question
would
occur
with
a
cruel
sharpness
after
some
brief
chance
interview
with
Dr.
John
.
<EOS>
He
have
still
such
kind
look
,
such
a
warm
hand
;
his
voice
still
keep
so
pleasant
a
tone
for
my
name
;
I
never
like
"
Lucy
"
so
well
as
when
he
utter
it
.
<EOS>
but
I
learn
in
time
that
this
benignity
,
this
cordiality
,
this
music
,
belong
in
no
shape
to
me
:
it
be
a
part
of
himself
;
it
be
the
honey
of
his
temper
;
it
be
the
balm
of
his
mellow
mood
;
he
impart
it
,
as
the
ripe
fruit
reward
with
sweetness
the
rifle
bee
;
he
diffuse
it
about
him
,
as
sweet
plant
shed
their
perfume
.
<EOS>
do
the
nectarine
love
either
the
bee
or
bird
<EOS>
it
feed
?
<EOS>
be
the
sweetbriar
enamour
of
the
air
?
  
<EOS>
"

thus
I
close
my

<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
They
say
that
hundred
of
year
ago
a
nun
be
bury
here
alive
at
the
foot
of
this
very
tree
,
beneath
the
ground
which
now
bear
us
.
"

<EOS>
and
that
in
former
day
a
nun
's
ghost
use
to
come
and
go
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Monsieur
,
what
if
it
come
and
go
here
still
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
something
come
and
go
here
:
there
be
a
shape
frequent
this
house
by
night
,
different
to
any
form
that
show
themselves
by
day
.
<EOS>
I
have
indisputably
see
a
something
,
more
than
once
;
and
to
me
its
conventual
weed
be
a
strange
sight
,
say
more
than
they
can
do
to
any
other
live
being

<EOS>
a
nun
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
monsieur
,
I
,
too
,
have
see
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
anticipate
that
.
<EOS>
whether
this
nun
be
flesh
and
blood
,
or
something
that
remain
when
blood
be
dry
,
and
flesh
be
waste
,
her
business
be
as
much
with
you
as
with
me
,
probably
.
<EOS>
well
,
I
mean
to
make
it
out
;
it
have
baffle
me
so
far
,
but
I
mean
to
follow
up
the
mystery
.
<EOS>
I
mean
 
"
  
instead
of
tell
what
he
mean
,
he
raise
his
head
suddenly
;
I
make
the
same
movement
in
the
same
instant
;
we
both
look
to
one
point
 
the
high
tree
shadow
the
great
berceau
,
and
rest
some
of
its
bough
on
the
roof
of
the
first
classe
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
strange
and
inexplicable
sound
from
that
quarter
,
as
if
the
arm
of
that
tree
have
sway
of
their
own
motion
,
and
its
weight
of
foliage
have
rush
and
crush
against
the
massive
trunk
.
<EOS>
yes
;
there
scarce
stir
a
breeze
,
and
that
heavy
tree
be
convulse
,
whilst
the
feathery
shrub
stand
still
.
<EOS>
for
some
minute
amongst
the
wood
and
leafage
a
rend
and
heaving
go
on
.
<EOS>
dark
as
it
be
,
it
seem
to
me
that
something
more
solid
than
either
night
-
shadow
,
or
branch
-
shadow
,
blacken
out
of
the
bole
.
<EOS>
at
last
the
struggle
cease
.
<EOS>
what
birth
succeed
this
travail
?
<EOS>
what
Dryad
be
bear
of
these
throe
?
<EOS>
We
watch
fixedly
.
<EOS>
a
sudden
bell
ring
in
the
house
 
<EOS>
the
prayer
-
bell
.
<EOS>
instantly
into
our
alley
there
come
,
out
of
the
berceau
,
an
apparition
,
all
black
and
white
.
<EOS>
with
a
sort
of
angry
rush
-
close
,
close
past
our
face
 
sweep
swiftly
the
very
nun
herself
!
<EOS>
never
have
I
see
her
so
clearly
.
<EOS>
She
look
tall
of
stature
,
and
fierce
of
gesture
.
<EOS>
as
she
go
,
the
wind
rise
sob
;
the
rain
pour
wild
and
cold
;
the
whole
night
seem
to
feel
her

<EOS>
the
FIRST
LETTER
.
  
<EOS>
where
,
it
become
time
to
inquire
,
be
Paulina
Mary
?
<EOS>
how
fare
my
intercourse
with
the
sumptuous
Hôtel
Crécy
?
<EOS>
that
intercourse
have
,
for
an
interval
,
be
suspend
by
absence
;
M.
and
Miss
de
Bassompierre
have
be
travel
,
divide
some
week
between
the
province
and
capital
of
France
.
<EOS>
chance
apprise
me
of
their
return
very
shortly
after
it
take
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
walk
one
mild
afternoon
on
a
quiet
boulevard
,
wander
slowly
on
,
enjoy
the
benign
April
sun
,
and
some
thought
not
unplease
,
when
I
see
before
me
a
group
of
rider
,
stop
as
if
they
have
just
encounter
,
and
exchange
greeting
in
the
midst
of
the
broad
,
smooth
,
linden
-
border
path
;
on
one
side
a
middle
-
aged
gentleman
and
young
lady
,
on
the
other
 
a
young
and
handsome
man
.
<EOS>
very
graceful
be
the
lady
's
mien
,
choice
her
appointment
,
delicate
and
stately
her
whole
aspect
.
<EOS>
still
,
as
I
look
,
I
feel
they
be
know
to
me
,
and
,
draw
a
little
nearer
,
I
fully
recognise
them
all
:
the
Count
Home
de
Bassompierre
,
his
daughter
,
and
Dr.
Graham
Bretton
.
  
<EOS>
how
animate
be
Graham
's
face
!
<EOS>
how
true
,
how
warm
,
yet
how
retire
the
joy
it
express
!
<EOS>
this
be
the
state
of
thing
,
this
the
combination
of
circumstance
,
at
once
to
attract
and
enchain
,
to
subdue
and
excite
Dr.
John
.
<EOS>
the
pearl
he
admire
be
in
itself
of
great
price
and
true
purity
,
but
he
be
not
the
man
who
,
in
appreciate
the
gem
,
could
forget
its
setting
.
<EOS>
have
he
see
Paulina
with
the
same
youth
,
beauty
,
and
grace
,
but
on
foot
,
alone
,
unguarded
,
and
in
simple
attire
,
a
dependent
worker
,
a
demi
-
grisette
,
he
would
have
think
her
a
pretty
little
creature
,
and
would
have
love
with
his
eye
her
movement
and
her
mien
,
but
it
require
other
than
this
to
conquer
him
as
he
be
now
vanquish
,
to
bring
him
safe
under
dominion
as
now
,
without
loss
,
and
even
with
gain
to
his
manly
honour
,
one
see
that
he
be
reduce
;
there
be
about
Dr.
John
all
the
man
of
the
world
;
to
satisfy
himself
do
not
suffice
;
society
must
approve
 
<EOS>
the
world
must
admire
what
he
do
,
or
he
count
his
measure
false
and
futile
.
<EOS>
in
his
victrix
he
require
all
that
be
here
visible
 
<EOS>
the
imprint
of
high
cultivation
,
the
consecration
of
a
careful
and
authoritative
protection
,
the
adjunct
that
fashion
decree
,
wealth
purchase
,
and
taste
adjust
;
for
these
condition
his
spirit
stipulate
ere
<EOS>
it
surrender
:
they
be
here
to
the
utmost
fulfil
;
and
now
,
proud
,
impassione
,
yet
fear
,
he
do
homage
to
Paulina
as
his
sovereign
.
<EOS>
as
for
her
,
the
smile
of
feeling
,
rather
than
of
conscious
power
,
sleep
soft
in
her
eye
.
  
<EOS>
They
part
.
<EOS>
He
pass
me
at
speed
,
hardly
feel
the
earth
he
skim
,
and
see
nothing
on
either
hand
.
<EOS>
He
look
very
handsome
;
mettle
and
purpose
be
rouse
in
him
fully

<EOS>
"
Papa

I

her

She
throw
back
her
veil

stoop
from
her

to
kiss
me

she

She
name
the

I
promise
compliance

<EOS>
the
morrow
's
evening
find
me
with
her
 
<EOS>
she
<EOS>
and
I
shut
into
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
her
since
that
occasion
when
her
claim
be
bring
into
comparison
with
those
of
Ginevra
Fanshawe
,
and
have
so
signally
prevail
;
she
have
much
to
tell
me
of
her
travel
in
the
interval
.
<EOS>
a
most
animated
,
rapid
speaker
be
she
in
such
a
tête
-
à

tête
,
a
most
lively
describer
;
yet
with
her
artless
diction
and
clear
soft
voice
,
she
never
seem
to
speak
too
fast
or
to
say
too
much
.
<EOS>
My
own
attention
<EOS>
I
think
would
not
soon
have
flag
,
but
by
-
and
-
by
,
she
herself
seem
to
need
some
change
of
subject
;
she
hasten
to
wind
up
her
narrative
briefly
.
<EOS>
yet
why
she
terminate
with
so
concise
an
abridgment
do
not
immediately
appear
;
silence
follow
 
a
restless
silence
,
not
without
symptom
of
abstraction
.
<EOS>
then
,
turn
to
me
,
in
a
diffident
,
half

appeal
voice
 
<EOS>

Lucy

I
be
at

you

You

not

any

of
course
she
still

of
Dr.
Bretton
?
<EOS>
She
can
not
have
change
her
mind
on
that
point

it
be
so
fix
two
month
ago

why

you

it
do
not

You
see
the
term
on
which
they
stand

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
little
misunderstanding
that
evening

certainly
;
do
she
seem
unhappy

not
she

to
change
the

Papa
have
letter
from
him
once

twice
about
business

I
think

He
undertake
the
management
of
some
affair
which
require
attention
while
we
be
away

Dr.

seem
to
respect
papa

to
have
pleasure
in
oblige
him

"
  
<EOS>

yes
:
you
meet
him
yesterday
on
the
boulevard
;
you
would
be
able
to
judge
from
his
aspect
that
his
friend
nee
not
be
painfully
anxious
about
his
health

papa
seem
to
have
think
with
you

<EOS>
I
could
not
help
smile
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
particularly
observant
,
you
know
,
because
he
be
often
think
of
other
thing
than
what
pass
before
his
eye
;
but
he
say
,
as
Dr.
Bretton
ride
away
,
"
really
it
do
a
man
good
to
see
the
spirit
and
energy
of
that
boy
.
"
<EOS>
He
call
Dr.
Bretton
a
boy
;
I
believe
he
almost
think
him
so
,
just
as
he
think
me
a
little
girl
;
he
be
not
speak
to
me
,
but
drop
that
remark
to
himself
.
<EOS>
Lucy

<EOS>
"
  
again
fall
the
appealing
accent
,
and
at
the
same
instant
she
leave
her
chair
,
and
come
and
sit
on
the
stool
at
my
foot
.
  
<EOS>
I
like
her

<EOS>
It
be
not
a
declaration
I
have
often
make
concern
my
acquaintance

in
the
course
of
this
book

the
reader
will
bear
with
it
for
once

<EOS>
intimate
intercourse
,
close
inspection
,
disclose
in
Paulina
only
what
be
delicate

intelligent

sincere
;
therefore
my
regard
for
her
lie
deep
.
<EOS>
an
admiration
more
superficial
may
have
be
more
demonstrative
;
mine

be
quiet

what

<EOS>
say
I

"
be
brave

out

there
be
no
courage

as
it
meet
mine

it
fall

there
be
no
coolness
on
her
cheek
 
not
a
transient
surface

blush

a
gathering
inward
excitement
raise
its

Dr.
Bretton
be
benevolent
 
humanely

the

gratitude
animate
her

lift
it

moment

She
have
yet
more
to
say

seem
hesitate
about
time

place

<EOS>
dusk
be
begin
to
reign
;
her
parlour
fire
already
glow
with
twilight
ruddiness

I

dimmer

the
hour
later

still
hold
my

play
with

dress
them

now
in

now
circle
them
with
a
twine

beautiful
hair

she
pat
the
palm
against

hot
cheek

at
last

have
clear
a
voice

liquid

a

minute
since

from

I

there
be
two

Papa
often
let

open
the

bag

give
him
out
the
content

<EOS>
one
morning
,
about
three
week
ago
,
you
do
not
know
how
surprised
I
be
to
find
,
amongst
a
dozen
letter
for
M.
de
Bassompierre
,
a
note
address
to
Miss
de
Bassompierre
.
<EOS>
I
spy
it
at
once
,
amidst
all
the
rest
;
the
handwriting
be
not
strange
;
it
attract
me
directly
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
say
,
"
Papa
,
here
be
another
letter
from
Dr.
Bretton
;
"
but
the
"
Miss
'
strike
me
mute
.
<EOS>
I
actually
never
receive
a
letter
from
a
gentleman
before
.
<EOS>
Ought
I
to
have
show
it
to
papa
,
and
let
him
open
it
and
read
it
first
?
<EOS>
I
could
not
for
my
life
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
so
well
papa
's
idea
about
me
<EOS>
:
he
forget
my
age
;
he
think
I
be
a
mere
school
-
girl
;
he
be
not
aware
that
other
people
see
I
be
grow
up
as
tall
as
I
shall
be
;
so
,
with
a
curious
mixture
of
feeling
,
some
of
them
self
-
reproachful
,
and
some
so
fluttering
and
strong
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
describe
them
,
I
give
papa
his
twelve
letter
 
his
herd
of
possession
 
and
keep
back
my
one
,
my
ewe
-
lamb
.
<EOS>
It
lie
in
my
lap
during
breakfast
,
look
up
at
me
with
an
inexplicable
meaning
,
make
me
feel
myself
a
thing
double
-
existent
 
a
child
to
that
dear
papa
,
but
no
more
a
child
to
myself
.
<EOS>
after
breakfast
I
carry
my
letter
up
-
stair
,
and
have
secure
myself
by
turn
the
key
in
the
door
,
I
begin
to
study
the
outside
of
my
treasure
:
it
be
some
minute
before
I
could
get
over
the
direction
and
penetrate
the
seal
;
one
do
not
take
a
strong
place
of
this
kind
by
instant
storm
 
<EOS>
one
sit
down
awhile
before
it
,
as
beleaguer
say
.
<EOS>
Graham
's
hand
be
like
himself
,
Lucy
,
and
so
be
his
seal
 
<EOS>
all
clear
,
firm
,
and
round
 
no
slovenly
splash
of
wax
 
<EOS>
a
full
,
solid
,
steady
drop
 
a
distinct
impress
;
no
pointed
turn
harshly
prick
the
optic
nerve
,
but
a
clean
,
mellow
,
pleasant
manuscript
,
that
soothe
you
as
you
read
.
<EOS>
It
be
like
his
face
 
just
like
the
chiselling
of
his
feature
:
do
you
know
his
autograph
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
see
it
:
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
seal
be
too
beautiful
to
be
break
,
so
I
cut
it
round
with
my
scissor
.
<EOS>
on
the
point
of
read
the
letter
at
last
,
I
once
more
draw
back
voluntarily
;
it
be
too
soon
yet
to
drink
that
draught
 
<EOS>
the
sparkle
in
the
cup
be
so
beautiful
 
<EOS>
I
would
watch
it
yet
a
minute
.
<EOS>
then
I
remember
all
at
once
that
I
have
not
say
my
prayer
that
morning
.
<EOS>
have
hear
papa
go
down
to
breakfast
a
little
earlier
than
usual
,
I
have
be
afraid
of
keep
him
wait
,
and
have
hasten
to
join
him
as
soon
as
dress
,
think
no
harm
to
put
off
prayer
till
afterwards
.
<EOS>
some
people
would
say
I
ought
to
have
serve
God
first
and
then
man
;
but
I
do
not
think
heaven
could
be
jealous
of
anything
I
may
do
for
papa
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
be
superstitious
.
<EOS>
a
voice
seem
now
to
say
that
another
feeling
than
filial
affection
be
in
question
 
to
urge
me
to
pray
before
I
dare
to
read
what
I
so
long
to
read
 
to
deny
myself
yet
a
moment
,
and
remember
first
a
great
duty
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
these
impulse
ever
since
I
can
remember
.
<EOS>
I
put
the
letter
down
and
say
my
prayer
,
add
,
at
the
end
,
a
strong
entreaty
that
whatever
happen
,
I
may
not
be
tempt
or
lead
to
cause
papa
any
sorrow
,
and
may
never
,
in
care
for
other
,
neglect
him
.
<EOS>
the
very
thought
of
such
a
possibility
,
so
pierce
my
heart
that
it
make
me
cry
.
<EOS>
but
still
,
Lucy
,
I
feel
that
in
time
papa
would
have
to
be
teach
the
truth
,
manage
,
and
induce
to
hear
reason

Graham
speak

must
first
prove

add
that

under

much
fear

much
struggle

would
have
trouble

good

may
perhaps
remember
,
have
not
have
the
honour
of
an
invitation
when
this
excursion
be
first
project
 
rather
the
contrary
;
but
on
my
now
make
allusion
to
this
fact
,
and
wish
to
know
how
it
be
to
be
,
my
ear
receive
a
pull
,
of
which
I
do
not
venture
to
challenge
the
repetition
by
raise
,
further
difficulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Je
vous
conseille
de
vous
faire
prier
,
"
say
M.
Emanuel
,
imperially
menace
the
other
ear
.
<EOS>
one
napoleonic
compliment
,
however
,
be
enough
,
so
I
make
up
my
mind
to
be
of
the
party
.
  
<EOS>
the
morning
break
calm
as
summer
,
with
singing
of
bird
in
the
garden
,
and
a
light
dew
-
mist
that
promise
heat
.
<EOS>
We
all
say
it
would
be
warm
,
and
we
all
feel
pleasure
in
fold
away
heavy
garment
,
and
in
assume
the
attire
suit
a
sunny
season
.
<EOS>
the
clean
fresh
print
dress
,
and
the
light
straw
bonnet
,
each
make
and
trim
as
the
french
workwoman
alone
can
make
and
trim
,
so
as
to
unite
the
utterly
unpretende
with
the
perfectly
become
,
be
the
rule
of
costume
.
<EOS>
nobody
flaunt
in
fade
silk
;
nobody
wear
a
second
-
hand
good
article
.
  
<EOS>
at
six
the
bell
ring
merrily
,
and
we
pour
down
the
staircase
,
through
the
carré
,
along
the
corridor
,
into
the
vestibule
.
<EOS>
there
stand
our
Professor
,
wear
,
not
his
savage
-
look
paletôt
and
severe
bonnet
-
grec
,
but
a
young
-
look
belt
blouse
and
cheerful
straw
hat
.
<EOS>
He
have
for
us
all
the
kind
good
-
morrow
,
and
most
of
us
for
him
have
a
thanksgiving
smile
.
<EOS>
We
be
marshal
in
order
and
soon
start
.
  
<EOS>
the
street
be
yet
quiet
,
and
the
boulevard
be
fresh
and
peaceful
as
field
.
<EOS>
I
believe
we
be
very
happy
as
we
walk
along
.
<EOS>
this
chief
of
our
have
the
secret
of
give
a
certain
impetus
to
happiness
when
he
would
;
just
as
,
in
an
opposite
mood
,
he
could
give
a
thrill
to
fear
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
lead
nor
follow
us
,
but
walk
along
the
line
,
give
a
word
to
every
one
,
talk
much
to
his
favourite
,
and
not
wholly
neglect
even
those
he
dislike
.
<EOS>
It
be
rather
my
wish
,
for
a
reason
I
have
,
to
keep
slightly
aloof
from
notice
,
and
be
pair
with
Ginevra
Fanshawe
,
bear
on
my
arm
the
dear
pressure
of
that
angel
's
not
unsubstantial
limb
 
<EOS>
(
she
continue
in
excellent
case
,
and
I
can
assure
the
reader
it
be
no
trifle
business
to
bear
the
burden
of
her
loveliness
;
many
a
time
in
the
course
of
that
warm
day
I
wish
to
goodness
<EOS>
there
have
be
less
of
the
charming
commodity
)
 
however
,
have
her
,
as
I
say
,
I
try
to
make
her
useful
by
interpose
her
always
between
myself
and
M.
Paul
,
shift
my
place
,
accord
as
I
hear
him
come
up
to
the
right
hand
or
the
left
.
<EOS>
My
private
motive
for
this
manoeuvre
may
be
trace
to
the
circumstance
of
the
new
print
dress
I
wear
,
be
pink
in
colour
 
<EOS>
a
fact
which
,
under
our
present
convoy
,
make
me
feel
something
as
I
have
feel
,
when
,
clothe
in
a
shawl
with
a
red
border
,
necessitate
to
traverse
a
meadow
where
pasture
a
bull
.
  
<EOS>
for
awhile
,
the
shifting
system
,
together
with
some
modification
in
the
arrangement
of
a
black
silk
scarf
,
answer
my
purpose
;
but
,
by
-
and
-
by
<EOS>
,
he
find
out
,
that
whether
he
come
to
this
side
or
to
that
,
Miss
Fanshawe
be
still
his
neighbour
.
<EOS>
the
course
of
acquaintance
between
Ginevra
and
him
have
never
run
so
smooth
that
his
temper
do
not
undergo
a
certain
crisping
process
whenever
he
hear
her
english
accent
:
<EOS>
nothing
in
their
disposition
fit
;
they
jar
if
they
come
in
contact
;
he
hold
her
empty
and
affected
;
she
deem
him
bearish
,
meddling
,
repellent
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
when
he
have
change
his
place
for
about
the
sixth
time
,
find
still
the
same
untoward
result
to
the
experiment
 
<EOS>
he
thrust
his
head
forward
,
settle
his
eye
on
mine
,
and
demand
with
impatience
,
"
Qu'est
-
ce
que
c'est
?
<EOS>
vous
me
jouez
des
tour
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
word
be
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
,
however
,
ere
,
with
his
customary
quickness
,
he
seize
the
root
of
this
proceeding
:
in
vain
I
shake
out
the
long
fringe
,
and
spread
forth
the
broad
end
of
my
scarf
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a

<EOS>
c'est
la

"
<EOS>
break
from
his
lip
,
affect
me
very
much
like
the
sudden
and
irate
low
of
some
lord
of
the
meadow
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
only
cotton

"
I
allege
,
hurriedly
;

and
cheap
,
and
wash
well
than
any
other
colour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"

he
answer

"
<EOS>
these
article
of
dress
be
just
like
what
my
companion
wear
;
certainly
not
one
whit
smart
 
perhaps
rather
plainer
than
most
 
<EOS>
but
Monsieur
have
now
get
hold
of
his
text
,
and
I
begin
to
chafe
under
the
expect
sermon
.
<EOS>
It
go
off
,
however
,
as
mildly
as
the
menace
of
a
storm
sometimes
pass
on
a
summer
day
.
<EOS>
I
get
but
<EOS>
one
flash
of
sheet
lightning
in
the
shape
of
a
single
bantering
smile
from
his
eye
;
<EOS>
and
then
he
say
,
"
courage
!
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
J'aime

"
say
he
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
be
not
to
be
dissatisfy
;
the
sun
of
good
humour
be
to
triumph
on
this
auspicious
morning
;
it
consume
scud
cloud
ere
<EOS>
they
sully
its
disk
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
we
be
in
the
country
,
amongst
what
they
call
"
les
bois
<EOS>
et
les
petit
sentier
.
<EOS>
"
these
wood
and
lane
a
month
later
would
offer
but
a
dusty
and
doubtful
seclusion
:
now
,
however
,
in
their
May
greenness
and
morning
repose
,
they
look
very
pleasant
.
  
<EOS>
We
reach
a
certain
well
,
plant
round
,
in
the
taste
of
Labassecour
,
with
an
orderly
circle
of
lime
-
tree
:
here
a
halt
be
call
;
on
the
green
swell
of
ground
surround
this
well
,
we
be
order
to
be
seat
,
Monsieur
take
his
place
in
our
midst
,
and
suffer
us
to
gather
in
a
knot
round
him
.
<EOS>
those
who
like
him
more
than
they
fear
,
come
close
,
and
these
be
chiefly
little
one
;
those
who
fear
more
than
they
like
,
keep
somewhat
aloof
;
those
in
whom
much
affection
have
give
,
even
to
what
remain
of
fear
,
a
pleasurable
zest
,
observe
the
great
distance
.
  
<EOS>
He
begin
to
tell
us
a
story
.
<EOS>
well
could
he
narrate
:
in
such
a
diction
as
child
love
,
and
learn
man
emulate
;
a
diction
simple
in
its
strength
,
and
strong
in
its
simplicity
.
<EOS>
there
be
beautiful
touch
in
that
little
tale
;
sweet
glimpse
of
feeling
and
hue
of
description
that
,
while
I
listen
,
sink
into
my
mind
,
and
since
have
never
fade
.
<EOS>
He
tint
a
twilight
scene
 
<EOS>
I
hold
it
in
memory
still
 
such
a
picture
I
have
never
look
on
from
artist
's
pencil
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
say
,
that
,
for
myself
,
I
have
no
impromptu
faculty
;
and
perhaps
that
very
deficiency
make
me
marvel
the
more
at
one
who
possess
it
in
perfection
.
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
be
not
a
man
to
write
book
;
but
I
have
hear
him
lavish
,
with
careless
,
unconscious
prodigality
,
such
mental
wealth
as
book
seldom
boast
;
his
mind
be
indeed
my
library
,
and
whenever
it
be
open
to
me
,
I
enter
bliss
.
<EOS>
intellectually
imperfect
as
I
be
,
I
could
read
little
;
there
be
few
bind
and
print
volume
that
do
not
weary
me
 
whose
perusal
do
not
fag
and
blind
 
but
<EOS>
his
tome
of
thought
be
collyrium
to
the
spirit
's
eye
;
over
their
content
,
inward
sight
grow
clear
and
strong
.
<EOS>
I
use
to
think
what
a
delight
it
would
be
for
one
who
love
him
better
than
he
love
himself
,
to
gather
and
store
up
those
handful
of
gold
-
dust
,
so
recklessly
flung
to
heaven
's
reckless
wind
.
  
<EOS>
His
story
do
,
he
approach
the
little
knoll
where
I
and
Ginevra
sit
apart
.
<EOS>
in
his
usual
mode
of
demand
an
opinion
(
he
have
not
reticence
to
wait
till
it
be
voluntarily
offer
)
he
ask
,
"
be
you
interested
?
"
  
<EOS>
accord
to
my
wonted
undemonstrative
fashion
,
I
simply
answer
 
"
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
good
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yet
I
could
not
write
that
down
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
not
,
Monsieur
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
the
mechanical
labour
;
I
hate
to
stoop
and
sit
still
.
<EOS>
I
could
dictate
it
,
though
,
with
pleasure
,
to
an
amanuensis
who
suit
me
.
<EOS>
Would
Mademoiselle
Lucy
write
for
me
if
I
ask
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
would
be
too
quick
;
he
would
urge
me
,
and
be
angry
if
my
pen
do
not
keep
pace
with
his
lip
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
try
some
day
;
let
us
see
the
monster
I
can
make
of
myself
under
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
but
just
now
,
there
be
no
question
of
dictation
;
I
mean
to
make
you
useful
in
another
office
.
<EOS>
do
you
see
yonder
farm
-
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
surround
with
tree
?
<EOS>
yes

.
  
<EOS>
"
there
we
be
to
breakfast
;
and
while
the
good
fermière
make
the
café
au
lait
in
a
caldron
,
you
and
five
other
,
whom
I
shall
select
,
will
spread
with
butter
half
a
hundred
roll
.
<EOS>
"
  
have
form
his
troop
into
line
once
more
,
he
march
us
straight
on
the
farm
,
which
,
on
see
our
force
,
surrender
without
capitulation
.
  
<EOS>
clean
knife
and
plate
,
and
fresh
butter
be
provide
,
half
-
a
-
dozen
of
us
,
choose
by
our
Professor
,
set
to
work
under
his
direction
,
to
prepare
for
breakfast
a
huge
basket
of
roll
,
with
which
the
baker
have
be
order
to
provision
the
farm
,
in
anticipation
of
our
come
.
<EOS>
coffee
and
chocolate
be
already
make
hot
;
cream
and
new
-
lay
egg
be
add
to
the
treat
,
and
M.
Emanuel
,
always
generous
,
would
have
give
a
large
order
for
"
jambon
"
and
"
confiture
"
in
addition
,
but
that
some
of
us
,
who
presume
perhaps
upon
our
influence
,
insist
that
it
would
be
a
most
reckless
waste
of
victual
.
<EOS>
He
rail
at
us
for
our
pain
,
term
us
"
des
ménagère
avare
;
"
but
we
let
him
talk
,
and
manage
the
economy
of
the
repast
our
own
way
.
  
<EOS>
with
what
a
pleasant
countenance
he
stand
on
the
farm
-
kitchen
hearth
look
on
!
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
whom
it
make
happy
to
see
other
happy
;
he
like
to
have
movement
,
animation
,
abundance
and
enjoyment
round
him
.
<EOS>
We
ask
where
he
would
sit
.
<EOS>
He
tell
us
,
we
know
well
he
be
our
slave
,
and
we
his
tyrant
,
and
that
he
dare
not
so
much
as
choose
a
chair
without
our
leave
;
so
we
set
him
the
farmer
's
great
chair
at
the
head
of
the
long
table
,
and
put
him
into
it
.
  
<EOS>
well
may
we
like
him
,
with
all
his
passion
and
hurricane
,
when
he
could
be
so
benignant
and
docile
at
time
,
as
he
be
just
now
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
at
the
bad
,
it
be
only
his
nerve
that
be
irritable
,
not
his
temper
that
be
radically
bad
;
soothe
,
comprehend
,
comfort
him
,
and
he
be
a
lamb
;
he
would
not
harm
a
fly
.
<EOS>
only
to
the
very
stupid
,
perverse
,
or
unsympathizing
,
be
he
in
the
slight
degree
dangerous
.
  
<EOS>
Mindful
always
of
his
religion
,
he
make
the
young
of
the
party
say
a
little
prayer
before
we
begin
breakfast
,
cross
himself
as
devotedly
as
a
woman
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
see
him
pray
before
,
or
make
that
pious
sign
;
he
do
it
so
simply
,
with
such
child
-
like
faith
,
I
could
not
help
smile
pleasurably
as
I
watch
;
his
eye
meet
my
smile
;
he
just
stretch
out
his
kind
hand
,
say
,
"
Donnez
-
moi
la
main
!
<EOS>
I
see
we
worship
the
same
God
,
in
the
same
spirit
,
though
by
different
rite

<EOS>
Most
of
M.
Emanuel
's
brother
professor
be
emancipate
free
-
thinker
,
infidel
,
atheist
;
and
many
of
them
man
whose
life
would
not
bear
scrutiny
;
he
be
more
like
a
knight
of
old
,
religious
in
his
way
,
and
of
spotless
fame
.
<EOS>
innocent
childhood
,
beautiful
youth
be
safe
at
his
side
.
<EOS>
He
have
vivid
passion
,
keen
feeling
,
but
his
pure
honour
and
his
artless
piety
be
the
strong
charm
that
keep
the
lion
couchant
.
  
<EOS>
that
breakfast
be
a
merry
meal
,
and
the
merriment
be
not
mere
vacant
clatter
:
M.
Paul
originate
,
lead
,
control
and
heighten
it
;
his
social
,
lively
temper
play
unfettered
and
unclouded
;
surround
only
by
woman
and
child
there
be
nothing
to
cross
and
thwart
him
;
he
have
his
own
way
,
and
a
pleasant
way
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
meal
over
,
the
party
be
free
to
run
and
play
in

a
few
stay
to
help
the
farmer

wife
to
put
away
her
earthenware
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
call
me
from
among
these
to
come
out
and
sit
near
him
under
a
tree
 
<EOS>
whence
he
could
view
the
troop
gambol
,
over
a
wide
pasture
 
and
read
to
him
whilst
he
take
his
cigar
.
<EOS>
He
sit
on
a
rustic
bench
,
and
I
at
the
tree
-
root
.
<EOS>
while
I
read
(
a
pocket
-
classic
 
<EOS>
a
Corneille
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
it
,
but
he
do
,
find
therein
beauty
I
never
could
be
bring
to
perceive
)
<EOS>
,
he
listen
with
a
sweetness
of
calm
the
more
impressive
from
the
impetuosity
of
his
general
nature
;
the
deep
happiness
fill
his
blue
eye
and
smooth
his
broad
forehead
.
<EOS>
I
,
too
,
be
happy
 
<EOS>
happy
with
the
bright
day
,
happy
with
his
presence
,
happy
with
his
kindness
.
  
<EOS>
He
ask
,
by
-
and
-
by
,
if
I
would
not
rather
run
to
my
companion
than
sit
there
?
<EOS>
I
say
,
no
;
<EOS>
I
feel
content
to
be
where
he
be
.
<EOS>
He
ask
whether
,
if
I
be
his
sister
,
I
should
always
be
content
to
stay
with
a
brother
such
as
he
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
believe
I
should
;
and
I
feel
it
.
<EOS>
again
,
he
inquire
whether
,
if
he
be
to
leave
Villette
,
and
go
far
away
,
I
should
be
sorry
;
and
I
drop
Corneille
,
and
make
no
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
petite
soeur
,
"
say
he
;
"
how
long
could
you
remember
me
if
we
be
separate
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
,
Monsieur

I
can
never
tell
,
because
I
do
not
know
how
long
it
will
be
before
I
shall
cease
to
remember
everything
earthly

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
be
to

beyond

three
 
five

should
you
welcome
me
on
my

<EOS>

Monsieur

how
could
I
live
in
the
interval

<EOS>
"
Pourtant

"
  
<EOS>
I
hide
my
face
with
the
book
,
for
it
be
cover
with
tear
.
<EOS>
I
ask
him
why
he
talk
so
;
and
he
say
he
would
talk
so
no
more
,
and
cheer
me
again
with
the
kind
encouragement
.
<EOS>
still
,
the
gentleness
with
which
he
treat
me
during
the
rest
of
the
day
,
go
somehow
to
my
heart
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
tender
.
<EOS>
It
be
mournful
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
he
have
be
abrupt
,
whimsical
,
and
irate
as
be
his
will
not

<EOS>
when
hot
noon
arrive
 
for
the
day
turn
out
as
we
have
anticipate
,
glow
as
June
 
<EOS>
our
shepherd
collect
his
sheep
from
the
pasture
,
and
proceed
to
lead
us
all
softly
home
.
<EOS>
but
we
have
a
whole
league
to
walk
,
thus
far
from
Villette
be
the
farm
where
he
have
breakfast
;
the
child
,
especially
,
be
tired
with
their
play
;
the
spirit
of
most
flag
at
the
prospect
of
this
mid
-
day
walk
over
chaussées
flinty
,
glaring
,
and
dusty
.
<EOS>
this
state
of
thing
have
be
foresee
and
provide
for
.
<EOS>
just
beyond
the
boundary
of
the
farm
we
meet
two
spacious
vehicle
come
to
fetch
us
 
<EOS>
such
conveyance
as
be
hire
out
purposely
for
the
accommodation
of
school

here
,
with
good

find
for
all

and
in
another
hour
M.
Paul
make
safe
consignment
of
his
charge
at
the
Rue
Fossette
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
a
pleasant
day
:
it
would
have
be
perfect
,
but
for
the
breathing
of
melancholy
which
have
dim
its
sunshine
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
that
tarnish
be
renew
the
same
evening

<EOS>
just
about
sunset
,
I
see
M.
Emanuel
come
out
of
the
front

door
,
accompany
by
Madame
Beck

<EOS>
They
pace
the
centre

alley
for
nearly
an
hour

talk
earnestly
:
he
 
look
grave
,
yet
restless
;
she
 
wear
an
amazed
,
expostulatory
,
dissuasive
air
.
  
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
be
under
discussion
;
and
when
Madame
Beck
re
-
enter
the
house
as
it
darken
,
leave
her
kinsman
Paul
yet
linger
in
the
garden

I
say
to
myself
 
"
<EOS>
He
call
me
"

this
morning

<EOS>
if
he
be
really
my
brother

how
I
should
like
to
go
to
him
just
now
,
and
ask
what
it
be
that
press
on
his
mind

<EOS>
see
how
he
lean
against
that
tree
,
with
his
arm
cross
and
his
brow
bent
.
<EOS>
He
want
consolation
,
I
know
:
Madame
do
not
console
:
she
only
remonstrate

<EOS>
what
now
 
?
"
  
<EOS>
start
from
quiescence
to
action
,
M.
Paul
come
stride
erect
and
quick
down
the
garden
.
<EOS>
the
carré
door
be
yet
open
:
I
think
he
be
probably
go
to
water
the
orange
-
tree
in
the
tub
,
after
his
occasional
custom
;
on
reach
the
court
,
however
,
he
take
an
abrupt
turn
and
make
for
the
berceau
and
the
first
-
classe
glass
door
.
<EOS>
there
,
in
that
first
classe
I
be
,
thence
I
have
be
watch
him
;
but
there
I
could
not
find
courage
to
await
his
approach
.
<EOS>
He
have
turn
so
suddenly
,
he
stride
so
fast
,
he
look
so
strange
;
the
coward
within
me
grow
pale
,
shrink
and
 
not
wait
to
listen
to
reason
,
and
hear
the
shrub
crush
and
the
gravel
crunch
to
his
advance
 
<EOS>
she
be
go
on
the
wing
of
panic
.
  
<EOS>
nor
do
I
pause
till
I
have
take
sanctuary
in
the
oratory
,
now
empty
.
<EOS>
listen
there
with
beating
pulse
,
and
an
unaccountable
,
undefined
apprehension
,
I
hear
him
pass
through
all
the
schoolroom
,
clash
the
door
impatiently
as
he
go
;
I
hear
him
invade
the
refectory
which
the
"
lecture
pieuse
"
be
now
hold
under
hallowed
constraint
;
I
hear
him
pronounce
these
word
 
<EOS>
"
où
est
Mademoiselle
Lucie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
just
as
,
summon
my
courage
,
I
be
prepare
to
go
down
and
do
what
,
after
all
,
I
most
wish
to
do
in
the
world
 
viz
.
,
<EOS>
meet
him
 
the
wiry
voice
of
St.
Pierre
reply
glibly
and
falsely
,
"
Elle
est
au
light
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
pass
,
with
the
stamp
of
vexation
,
into
the
corridor
.
<EOS>
there
Madame
Beck
meet
,
capture
,
chid
,
convoy
to
the
street

door
,
and
finally
dismiss
him

<EOS>
as
that
street

door
close
,
a
sudden
amazement
at
my
own
perverse
proceeding
strike
like
a
blow
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
feel
from
the
first
it
be
me
<EOS>
he
want
 
me
he

and
have
not
I
want
him
too

what

then

have
carry
me
away

<EOS>
what
have
rapt
me
beyond
his
reach
?
<EOS>
He
have
something
to
tell
:
he
be
go
to
tell
me
that
something
:
my
ear
strain
its
nerve
to
hear
it
,
and
I
have
make
the
confidence
impossible
.
<EOS>
yearn
to
listen
and
console
,
while
I
think
audience
and
solace
beyond
<EOS>
hope
's
reach
 
no
sooner
do
opportunity
suddenly
and
fully
arrive
,
than
I
evade
it
as
I
would
have
evade
the
level
shaft
of
mortality
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
my
insane
inconsistency
have
its
reward
.
<EOS>
instead
of
the
comfort
,
the
certain
satisfaction
,
I
may
have
win
 
<EOS>
could
I
but
have
put
choking
panic
down

firm

here

dead
blank

dark

MALEVOLA

<EOS>
Madame
Beck
call
me
on
Thursday
afternoon
,
and
ask
whether
I
have
any
occupation
to
hinder
me
from
go
into
town
and
execute
some
little
commission
for
her
at
the
shop

<EOS>
be
disengage

and
have
equip
myself
in
a
manner
suit
the
threatening
aspect
of
a
cloudy
and
sultry
day

I
be
just
draw
the
spring

bolt
of
the
street

door
,
in
act
to
issue
forth
,
when
Madame

voice
again
summon
me
to
the
salle

manger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
,
Meess
Lucie
!
"
cry
she
,
in
the
seeming
haste
of
an
impromptu
thought
,
"
I
have
just
recollect
one
more
errand
for
you
,
if
your
good

nature
will
not
deem
itself
over

burden
?
"
  
<EOS>
of
course
I
"
confound
myself
"
in
asseveration
to
the
contrary
;
and
Madame
,
run
into
the
little
salon
,
bring
thence
a
pretty
basket
,
fill
with
fine
hothouse
fruit
,
rosy
,
perfect
,
and
tempting
,
repose
amongst
the
dark
green
,
wax
-
like
leave

and
pale
yellow
star
of

I
know
not
what

exotic
plant
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
,
"
she
say
,
"
it
be
not
heavy

and
will
not
shame
your
neat
toilette

as
if
it

<EOS>
do
me
the
favour
to
leave
this
little
basket
at

house

with
my
felicitation

live
down
in

Rue

I
fear
you
will
find
the
walk
rather
long
,
but
you
have
the
whole
afternoon
before
you
,

do
not
hurry
;
if
you
be
not
back

call
me
back
once
more

be
sure
to
insist
on
see
Madame
Walravens
herself
,

give
the
basket
into
her
own

in
order
that
there
may

Adieu

"
  
<EOS>
and
at
last
I
get
away
.
<EOS>
the
shop
commission
take
some
time
to
execute
,
that
choose
and
matching
of
silk
and
wool
be
always
a
tedious
business
,
but
at
last
I
get
through
my
list
.
<EOS>
the
pattern
for
the
slipper
,
the
bell

ropes
,
the
cabas

whole

tripotage

in
short

be
off
my
mind
;
nothing
but
the
fruit
and
the
felicitation
remain
to
be
attend
to
.
  
<EOS>
I
rather
like
the
prospect
of
a
long
walk
,
deep
into
the
old
and
grim
Basse
-
Ville
;
and
I
like
it
no
bad
because
the
evening
sky
,
over
the
city
,
be
settle
into
a
mass
of
black
-
blue
metal
,
heat
at
the
rim
,
and
inflame
slowly
to
a
heavy
red
.
  
<EOS>
I
fear
a
high
wind
,
because
storm
demand
that
exertion
of
strength
and
use
of
action
I
always
yield
with
pain
;
but
the
sullen
down
-
fall
,
the
thick
snow
-
descent
,
or
dark
rush
of
rain
,
ask
only
resignation
 
the
quiet
abandonment
of
garment
and
person
to
be
,
drench
.
<EOS>
in
return
,
it
sweep
a
great
capital
clean
before
you
;
it
make
you
a
quiet
path
through
broad
,
grand
street
;
it
petrify
a
live
city
as
if
by
eastern
enchantment
;
it
transform
a
Villette
into
a
Tadmor
.
<EOS>
let
,
then
,
the
rain
fall
,
and
the
flood
descend
 
only
I
must
first
get
rid
of
this
basket
of
fruit
.
  
<EOS>
an
unknown
clock
from
an
unknown
tower
<EOS>
(
Jean
Baptiste
's
voice
be
now
too
distant
to
be
audible
)
be
toll
the
third
quarter
past
five
,
when
I
reach
that
street
and
house
whereof
Madame
Beck
have
give
me
the
address
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
street
at
all
;
it
seem
rather
to
be
part
of
a
square
:
<EOS>
it
be
quiet
,
grass
grow
between
the
broad
grey
flag
,
the
house
be
large
and
look
very
old
 
behind
them
rise
the
appearance
of
tree
,
indicate
garden
at
the
back
.
<EOS>
antiquity
brood
above
this
region
,
business
be
banish
thence
.
<EOS>
rich
man
have
once
possess
this
quarter
,
and
once
grandeur
have
make
her
seat
here
.
<EOS>
that
church
,
whose
dark
,
half
-
ruinous
turret
overlook
the
square
,
be
the
venerable
and
formerly
opulent
shrine
of
the
Magi
.
<EOS>
but
wealth
and
greatness
have
long
since
stretch
their
gilded
pinion
and
flee
hence
,
leave
these
their
ancient
nest
,
perhaps
to
house
penury
for
a
time
,
or
perhaps
to
stand
cold
and
empty
,
moulder
untenanted
in
the
course
of
winter
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
cross
this
desert
"
place
,
"
on
whose
pavement
drop
almost
as
large
as
a
five
-
franc
piece
be
now
slowly
darken
,
I
see
,
in
its
whole
expanse
,
no
symptom
or
evidence
of
life
,
except
what
be
give
in
the
figure
of
an
infirm
old
priest
,
who
go
past
,
bend
and
prop
on
a
staff
 
the
type
of
eld
and
decay
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
issue
from
the
very
house
to
which
I
be
direct
;
and
when
I
pause
before
the
door
just
close
after
him
,
and
ring
the
bell
,
he
turn
to
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
nor
do
he
soon
avert
his
gaze
;
perhaps
he
think
me
,
with
my
basket
of
summer
fruit
,
and
my
lack
of
the
dignity
age
confer
,
an
incongruous
figure
in
such
a
scene
.
<EOS>
I
know
,
have
a
young
ruddy
-
face
bonne
open
the
door
to
admit
me
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
think
such
a
one
little
in
harmony
with
her
dwelling
;
but
,
when
I
find
myself
confront
by
a
very
old
woman
,
wear
a
very
antique
peasant
costume
,
a
cap
alike
hideous
and
costly
,
with
long
flap
of
native
lace
,
a
petticoat
and
jacket
of
cloth
,
and
sabot
more
like
little
boat
than
shoe
,
it
seem
all
right
,
and
soothingly
in
character
.
  
<EOS>
the
expression
of
her
face
be
not
quite
so
soothing
as
the
cut
of
her
costume
;
anything
more
cantankerous
I
have
seldom
see
;
she
would
scarcely
reply
to
my
inquiry
after
Madame
Walravens
;
I
believe
she
would
have
snatch
the
basket
of
fruit
from
my
hand
,
have
not
the
old
priest
,
hobble
up
,
check
her
,
and
himself
lend
an
ear
to
the
message
with
which
I
be
charge
.
  
<EOS>
His
apparent
deafness
render
it
a
little
difficult
to
make
him
fully
understand
that
I
must
see
Madame
Walravens
,
and
consign
the
fruit
into
her
own
hand
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
however
,
he
comprehend
the
fact
that
such
be
my
order
,
and
that
duty
enjoin
their
literal
fulfilment
.
<EOS>
address
the
aged
bonne
,
not
in
French
,
but
in
the
aboriginal
tongue
of
Labassecour
,
he
persuade
her
,
at
last
,
to
let
me
cross
the
inhospitable
threshold
,
and
himself
escort
me
up
-
stair
,
I
be
usher
into
a
sort
of
salon
,
and
there
leave
.
  
<EOS>
the
room
be
large
,
and
have
a
fine
old
ceiling
,
and
almost
church
-
like
window
of
coloured
-
glass
;
but
it
be
desolate
,
and
in
the
shadow
of
a
come
storm
,
look
strangely
lower
.
<EOS>
within
 
open
a
small
room
;
there
,
however
,
the
blind
of
the
single
casement
be
close
;
through
the
deep
gloom
few
detail
of
furniture
be
apparent
.
<EOS>
these
few
I
amuse
myself
by
puzzle
to
make
out
;
and
,
in
particular
,
I
be
attract
by
the
outline
of
a
picture
on
the
wall
.
  
<EOS>
by
-
and
-
by
the
picture
seem
to
give
way
:
to
my
bewilderment
,
it
shake
,
it
sink
,
it
roll
back
into
nothing
;
its
vanishing
leave
an
opening
arched
,
lead
into
an
arched
passage
,
with
a
mystic
winding
stair
;
both
passage
and
stair
be
of
cold
stone
,
uncarpeted
and
unpainted
.
<EOS>
down
this
donjon
stair
descend
a
tap
,
tap
,
like
a
stick
;
soon
there
fall
on
the
step
a
shadow
,
and
last
of
all
<EOS>
,
I
be
aware
of
a
substance
.
  
<EOS>
yet
,
be
it
actual
substance
,
this
appearance
approach
me
?
<EOS>
this
obstruction
,
partially
darken
the
arch
?
  
<EOS>
It
draw
near
,
and
I
see
it
well
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
comprehend
where
I
be
.
<EOS>
well
may
this
old
square
be
name
quarter
of
the
Magi
 
<EOS>
well
may
the
three
tower
,
overlook
it
,
own
for
godfather
three
mystic
sage
of
a
dead
and
dark
art
.
<EOS>
hoar
enchantment
here
prevail
;
a
spell
have
open
for
me
elf
-
land
 
<EOS>
that
cell
-
like
room
,
that
vanish
picture
,
that
arch
and
passage
,
and
stair
of
stone
,
be
all
part
of
a
fairy
tale
.
<EOS>
Distincter
even
than
these
scenic
detail
stand
the
chief
figure
 
Cunegonde
,
the
sorceress
!
<EOS>
Malevola
,
the
evil
fairy
.
<EOS>
how
be
she
?
  
<EOS>
She
may
be
three
foot
high
,
but
she
have
no
shape
;
her
skinny
hand
rest
upon
each
other
,
and
press
the
gold
knob
of
a
wand
-
like
ivory
staff
.
<EOS>
Her
face
be
large
,
set
,
not
upon
her
shoulder
,
but
before
her
breast
;
she
seem
to
have
no
neck
;
I
should
have
say
there
be
a
hundred
year
in
her
feature
,
and
more
perhaps
in
her
eye
 
her
malign
,
unfriendly
eye
,
with
thick
grey
brow
above
,
and
livid
lid
all
round
.
<EOS>
how
severely
they
view
me
,
with
a
sort
of
dull
displeasure
!
  
<EOS>
this
being
wear
a
gown
of
brocade
,
dye
bright
blue
,
full
-
tint
as
the
gentianella
flower
,
and
cover
with
satin
foliage
in
a
large
pattern
;
over
the
gown
a
costly
shawl
,
gorgeously
border
,
and
so
large
for
her
,
that
its
many
-
coloured
fringe
sweep
the
floor
.
<EOS>
but
her
chief
point
be
her
jewel
:
she
have
long
,
clear
earring
,
blaze
with
a
lustre
which
could
not
be
borrow
or
false
;
she
have
ring
on
her
skeleton
hand
,
with
thick
gold
hoop
,
and
stone
 
purple
,
green
,
and
blood
-
red
.
<EOS>
hunchbacked
,
dwarfish
,
and
doting
,
she
be
adorn
like
a
barbarian
queen
.
  
<EOS>
"
que
me
voulez
-
vous
?
"
<EOS>
say
she
,
hoarsely
,
with
the
voice
rather
of
male
than
of
female
old
age
;
and
,
indeed
,
a
silver
beard
bristle
her
chin
.
  
<EOS>
I
deliver
my
basket
and
my
message
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
that
all
?
"
<EOS>
she
demand
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
,
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
truly
,
it
be
well
worth
while
,
"
she
answer
.
<EOS>
"
return
to
Madame
Beck
,
and
tell
her
I
can
buy
fruit
when
I
want
it
,
<EOS>
et
quant
<EOS>
à

félicitation
,
je

"
<EOS>
and
this
courteous
dame
turn
her
back
.
  
<EOS>
just
as
she
turn
,
a
peal
of
thunder
break
,
and
a
flash
of
lightning
blaze
broad
over
salon
and
boudoir
.
<EOS>
the
tale
of
magic
seem
to
proceed
with
due
accompaniment
of
the
element
.
<EOS>
the
wanderer
,
decoy
into
the
enchanted
castle
,
hear
rise
,
outside
,
the
spell
-
waken
tempest
.
  
<EOS>
what
,
in
all
this
,
be
I
to
think
of
Madame
Beck
?
<EOS>
She
own
strange
acquaintance
;
she
offer
message
and
gift
at
an
unique
shrine
,
and
inauspicious
seem
the
bearing
of
the
uncouth
thing
she
worship
.
<EOS>
there
go
that
sullen
Sidonia
,
totter
and
tremble
like
palsy
incarnate
,
tap
her
ivory
staff
on
the
mosaic
parquet
,
and
mutter
venomously
as
she
vanish
.
  
<EOS>
down
wash
the
rain
<EOS>
,
deep
lower
the
welkin
;
the
cloud
,
ruddy
a
while
ago
,
have
now
,
through
all
their
blackness
,
turn
deadly
pale
,
as
if
in
terror
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
my
late
boast
about
not
fear
a
shower
,
I
hardly
like
to
go
out
under
this
waterspout
.
<EOS>
then
the
gleam
of
lightning
be
very
fierce
,
the
thunder
crash
very
near
;
this
storm
have
gather
immediately
above
Villette
;
it
seem
to
have
burst
at
the
zenith
;
it
rush
down
prone
;
the
forked
,
slant
bolt
pierce
athwart
vertical
torrent
;
red
zigzag
interlace
a
descent
blanch
as
white
metal
:
and
all
break
from
a
sky
heavily
black
in
its
swollen
abundance
.
  
<EOS>
Leaving
Madame
Walravens
'
inhospitable
salon
<EOS>
,
I
betook
myself
to
her
cold
staircase
;
there
be
a
seat
on
the
landing
 
there
<EOS>
I
wait
.
<EOS>
somebody
come
glide
along
the
gallery
just
above
;
it
be
the
old
priest
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
Mademoiselle
shall
not
sit
there
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
displeasure
our
benefactor
if
he
know
a
stranger
be
so
treat
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
he
beg
me
so
earnestly
to
return
to
the
salon
,
that
,
without
discourtesy
,
I
could
not
but
comply
.
<EOS>
the
small
room
be
better
furnish
and
more
habitable
than
the
large
;
thither
he
introduce
me
.
<EOS>
partially
withdraw
the
blind
,
he
disclose
what
seem
more
like
an
oratory
than
a
boudoir
,
a
very
solemn
little
chamber
,
look
as
if
it
be
a
place
rather
dedicated
to
relic
and
remembrance
,
than
design
for
present
use
and
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
the
good
father
sit
down
,
as
if
to
keep
me
company
;
but
instead
of
converse
,
he
take
out
a
book
,
fasten
on
the
page
his
eye
,
and
employ
his
lip
in
whisper
 
what
sound
like
a
prayer
or
litany
.
<EOS>
a
yellow
electric
light
from
the
sky
gild
his
bald
head
;
his
figure
remain
in
shade
 
deep
and
purple
;
he
sit
still
as
sculpture
;
he
seem
to
forget
me
for
his
prayer
;
he
only
look
up
when
a
fiercer
bolt
,
or
a
harsh
,
closer
rattle
tell
of
near
danger
;
even
then
,
it
be
not
in
fear
,
but
in
seem
awe
,
he
raise
his
eye
.
<EOS>
I
too
be
awe
-
strike
;
be
,
however
,
under
no
pressure
of
slavish
terror
,
<EOS>
my
thought
and
observation
be
free
.
  
<EOS>
to
speak
truth
,
I
be
begin
to
fancy
that
the
old
priest
resemble
that
Père
Silas
,
before
whom
I
have
kneel
in
the
church
of
the
Béguinage
.
<EOS>
the
idea
be
vague
,
for
I
have
see
my
confessor
only
in
dusk
and
in
profile
,
yet
still
I
seem
to
trace
a
likeness
:
<EOS>
I
think
also
I
recognize
the
voice
.
<EOS>
while
I
watch
him
,
he
betray
,
by
one
lifted
look
,
that
he
feel
my
scrutiny
;
I
turn
to
note
the
room
;
that
too
have
its
half
mystic
interest
.
  
<EOS>
beside
a
cross
of
curiously
carve
old
ivory
,
yellow
with
time
,
and
slope
above
a
dark
-
red
_
prie
-
dieu
_
,
furnish
duly
,
with
rich
missal
and
ebon
rosary
 
hang
the
picture
whose
dim
outline
have
draw
my
eye
before
 
the
picture
which
move
,
fall
away
with
the
wall
and
let
in
phantom
.
<EOS>
imperfectly
see
,
I
have
take
it
for
a
Madonna
;
reveal
by
clear
light
,
it
prove
to
be
a
woman
's
portrait
in
a
nun
's
dress
.
<EOS>
the
face
,
though
not
beautiful
,
be
pleasing
;
pale
,
young
,
and
shade
with
the
dejection
of
grief
or
ill
health
.
<EOS>
I
say
again
it
be
not
beautiful
;
it
be
not
even
intellectual
;
its
very
amiability
be
the
amiability
of
a
weak
frame
,
inactive
passion
,
acquiescent
habit
:
yet
I
look
long
at
that
picture
,
and
could
not
choose
but
look
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
priest
,
who
at
first
have
seem
to
me
so
deaf
and
infirm
,
must
yet
have
retain
his
faculty
in
tolerable
preservation
;
absorb
in
his
book
as
he
appear
,
without
once
lift
his
head
,
or
,
as
far
as
I
know
,
turn
his
eye
,
he
perceive
the
point
towards
which
my
attention
be
draw
,
and
,
in
a
slow
distinct
voice
,
drop
,
concern
it
,
<EOS>
these
four
observation
:
    
<EOS>
"
She
be
much
beloved
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
give
herself
to
God
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
die
young
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
still
remember
,
still
weep
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
by
that
aged
lady
,
Madame
Walravens
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
,
fancy
that
I
have
discover
in
the
incurable
grief
of
bereavement
,
a
key
to
that
same
aged
lady
's
desperate
ill
-
humour
.
  
<EOS>
the
father
shake
his
head
with
half
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
he
;
"
a
grand
-
dame
's
affection
for
her
child
's
child
may
be
great
,
and
her
sorrow
for
their
loss
,
lively
;
but
it
be
only
the
affianced
lover
,
to
whom
Fate
,
Faith
,
and
death
have
trebly
deny
the
bliss
of
union
,
who
mourn
what
he
have
lose
,
as
Justine
Marie
be
still
mourn
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
the
father
rather
wish
to
be
question
,
and
therefore
I
inquire
who
have
lose
and
who
still
mourn
"
Justine
Marie
.
<EOS>
"
I
get
,
in
reply
,
quite
a
little
romantic
narrative
,
tell
not
unimpressively
,
with
the
accompaniment
of
the
now
subside
storm
.
<EOS>
I
be
bind
to
say
it
may
have
be
make
much
more
truly
impressive
,
if
there
have
be
less
French
,
Rousseau
-
like
sentimentalizing
and
wire
-
drawing
;
and
rather
more
healthful
carelessness
of
effect
.
<EOS>
but
the
worthy
father
be
obviously
a
Frenchman
bear
and
breed
(
I
become
more
and
more
persuaded
of
his
resemblance
to
my
confessor
)
 
<EOS>
he
be
a
true
son
of
Rome
;
when
he
do
lift
his
eye
,
he
look
at
me
out
of
their
corner
,
with
more
and
sharp
subtlety
than
,
one
would
have
think
,
could
survive
the
wear
and
tear
of
seventy
year
.
<EOS>
yet
,
I
believe
,
he
be
a
good
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
the
hero
of
his
tale
be
some
former
pupil
of
his
,
whom
he
now
call
his
benefactor
,
and
who
,
it
appear
,
have
love
this
pale
Justine
Marie
,
the
daughter
of
rich
parent
,
at
a
time
when
his
own
worldly
prospect
be
such
as
to
justify
his
aspire
to
a
well
-
dower
hand
.
<EOS>
the
pupil
's
father
 
once
a
rich
banker
 
have
fail
,
die
,
and
leave
behind
him
only
debt
and
destitution
.
<EOS>
the
son
be
then
forbid
to
think
of
Marie
;
especially
that
old
witch
of
a
grand
-
dame
I
have
see
,
Madame
Walravens
,
oppose
the
match
with
all
the
violence
of
a
temper
which
deformity
make
sometimes
demoniac
.
<EOS>
the
mild
Marie
have
neither
the
treachery
to
be
false
,
nor
the
force
to
be
quite
staunch
to
her
lover
;
she
give
up
her
first
suitor
,
but
,
refuse
to
accept
a
second
with
a
heavy
purse
,
withdraw
to
a
convent
,
and
there
die
in
her
noviciate
.
  
<EOS>
last
anguish
,
it
seem
,
have
take
possession
of
the
faithful
heart
which
worship
her
,
and
the
truth
of
that
love
and
grief
have
be
show
in
a
manner
which
touch
even
me
,
as
I
listen
.
  
<EOS>
some
year
after
Justine
Marie
's
death
,
ruin
have
come
on
her
house
too
:
her
father
,
by
nominal
call
a
jeweller
,
but
who
also
deal
a
good
deal
on
the
Bourse
,
have
be
concern
in
some
financial
transaction
which
entail
exposure
and
ruinous
fine
.
<EOS>
He
die
of
grief
for
the
loss
,
and
shame
for
the
infamy
.
<EOS>
His
old
hunchbacked
mother
and
his
bereave
wife
be
leave
penniless
,
and
may
have
die
too
of
want
;
but
their
lose
daughter
's
once
-
despise
,
yet
most
true
-
hearted
suitor
,
hearing
of
the
condition
of
these
lady
,
come
with
singular
devotedness
to
the
rescue
.
<EOS>
He
take
on
their
insolent
pride
the
revenge
of
the
pure
charity
 
housing
,
care
for
,
befriend
them
,
so
as
no
son
could
have
do
it
more
tenderly
and
efficiently
.
<EOS>
the
mother
 
on
the
whole
a
good
woman
 
die
bless
him
;
<EOS>
the
strange
,
godless
,
loveless
,
misanthrope
grandmother
live
still

entirely
support
by
this

man

<EOS>
Her

who
have
be
the
bane
of
his
life
,
blight
his
hope
,
and

mourning

cheerless
solitude

with

a
good

offer
a
kind
mother

He
have
bring
her
to
this

continue
the

genuine

rise
to
his

his

a
superannuated
servant

he
devote
three

part
of
his

keep
only
the
fourth
to
provide
himself
with
bread
and
the
most
modest
accommodation
.
<EOS>
by
this
arrangement
he
have
render
it
impossible
to
himself
ever
to
marry
:
he
have
give
himself
to
God
and
to
his
angel
-
bride
as
much
as
if
he
be
a
priest

like
me

<EOS>
the
father
have
wipe
away
his
tear
before
he
utter
these
last
word
,
and
in
pronounce
them
,
<EOS>
he
for
one
instant
raise
his
eye
to
mine
.
<EOS>
I
catch
this
glance
,
despite
its
veiled
character
;
the
momentary
gleam
shoot
a
meaning
which
strike
me
.
  
<EOS>
these
Romanists
be
strange
being
.
<EOS>
such
a
one
among
them
 
whom
you
know
no
more
than
the
last
Inca
of
Peru
,
or
the
first
Emperor
of
China
 
know
you
and
all
your
concern
;
and
have
his
reason
for
say
to
you
so
and
so
,
when
you
simply
think
the
communication
spring
impromptu
from
the
instant
's
impulse
:
his
plan
in
bring
it
about
that
you
shall
come
on
such
a
day
,
to
such
a
place
,
under
such
and
such
circumstance
,
when
the
whole
arrangement
seem
to
your
crude
apprehension
the
ordinance
of
chance
,
or
the
sequel
of
exigency

<EOS>
Madame
Beck
's
suddenly
-
recollected
message
and
present
,
my
artless
embassy
to
the
Place
of
the
Magi
,
the
old
priest
accidentally
descend
the
step
and
cross
the
square
,
his
interposition
on
my
behalf
with
the
bonne
who
would
have
send
me
away
,
his
reappearance
on
the
staircase
,
my
introduction
to
this
room
,
the
portrait
,
the
narrative
so
affably
volunteer
 
<EOS>
all
these
little
incident
,
take
as
they
fall
out
,
seem
each
independent
of
its
successor
;
a
handful
of
loose
bead
:
but
thread
through
by
that
quick
-
shot
and
crafty
glance
of
a
Jesuit
-
eye
,
they
drop
pendent
in
a
long
string
,
like
that
rosary
on
the
prie
-
dieu
.
<EOS>
where
lie
the
link
of
junction
,
where
the
little
clasp
of
this
monastic
necklace
?
<EOS>
I
see
or
feel
union
,
but
could
not
yet
find
the
spot
,
or
detect
the
mean
of
connection
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
the
musing
-
fit
into
which
I
have
by
this
time
fall
,
appear
somewhat
suspicious
in
its
abstraction
;
he
gently
interrupt
:
"
<EOS>
Mademoiselle

say
he
,
"
I
trust
you
have
not
far
to
go
through
these
inundate

<EOS>
"
More

half
a

<EOS>
"
You

"
  
"
<EOS>
in

Rue
Fossette

<EOS>
not

(
with
animation
)
,
"
not
at

"
<EOS>
the

"
He
and

"
  
<EOS>
a
brief
silence
fall
.
<EOS>
the
spring
of
junction
seem
suddenly
to
have
become
palpable
;
I
feel
it
yield
to
pressure

<EOS>
"
be
it

M.

<EOS>
"
I
presently
inquire
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
be

your
pupil

the
benefactor
of
Madame
Walravens
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
and
of
Agnes
,
the
old
servant
:
and
moreover
,
(
with
a
certain
emphasis
)
,
he
be
and
_
be
_
the
lover
,
true
,
constant
and
eternal
,
of
that
saint
in

Justine
Marie

"
  
"
<EOS>
and
who
,
father
,
be
_
you
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
I
continue
;
and
though
I
accentuate
the
question
,
its
utterance
be
well
nigh
superfluous
<EOS>
;
I
be
ere
this
quite
prepared
for
the
answer
which
actually
come
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
,
daughter
,
be
Père
Silas
;
that
unworthy
son
of
Holy
Church
whom
you
once
honour
with
a
noble
and
touching
confidence
,
show
me
the
core
of
a
heart
,
and
the
inner
shrine
of
a
mind
whereof
,
in
solemn
truth
<EOS>
,
I
covet
the
direction
,
in
behalf
of
the
only
true
faith
.
<EOS>
nor
have
I
for
a
day
lose
sight
of
you
,
nor
for
an
hour
fail
to
take
in
you
a
root
interest
.
<EOS>
pass
under
the
discipline
of
Rome
,
mould
by
her
high
training
,
inoculate
with
her
salutary
doctrine
,
inspire
by
the
zeal
she
alone
give
 
<EOS>
I
realize
what
then
may
be
your
spiritual
rank
,
your
practical
value
;
and
I
envy
Heresy
her
prey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
strike
me
as
a
special
state
of
thing
 
<EOS>
I
half
-
realize
myself
in
that
condition
also
;
pass
under
discipline
,
mould
,
train
,
inoculate
,
and
so
on
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
not
so
,
"
think
I
,
but
I
restrain
deprecation
,
and
sit
quietly
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
M.
Paul
do
not
live
here
?
<EOS>
"
I
resume
,
pursue
a
theme
which
I
think
more
to
the
purpose
than
any
wild
renegade
dream
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
;
he
only
come
occasionally
to
worship
his
beloved
saint
,
to
make
his
confession
to
me
,
and
to
pay
his
respect
to
her
<EOS>
he
call
his
mother
.
<EOS>
His
own
lodging
consist
but
<EOS>
of
two
room
:
he
have
no
servant
,
and
yet
he
will
not
suffer
Madame
Walravens
to
dispose
of
those
splendid
jewel
with
which
you
see
her
adorn
,
and
in
which
she
take
a
puerile
pride
as
the
ornament
of
her
youth
,
and
the
last
relic
of
her
son
the
jeweller
's
wealth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
often
,
"
murmur
I
to
myself
,
"
have
this
man
,
this
M.
Emanuel
,
seem
to
me
to
lack
magnanimity
in
trifle
,
yet
how
great
he
be
in
great
thing
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
own
<EOS>
I
do
not
reckon
amongst
the
proof
of
his
greatness
,
<EOS>
either
the
act
of
confession
,
or
the
saint
-
worship
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
long
be
it
since
that
lady
die
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
,
look
at
Justine
Marie
.
  
<EOS>
"
twenty
year
.
<EOS>
She
be
somewhat
old
than
M.
Emanuel
;
he
be
then
very
young
,
for
he
be
not
much
beyond
forty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
he
yet
weep
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
heart
will
weep
her
always
:
the
essence
of
Emanuel
's
nature
be
 
constancy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
say
with
marked
emphasis
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
the
sun
break
out
pallid
and
waterish
;
the
rain
yet
fall
,
but
there
be
no
more
temp
:
that
hot
firmament
have
cleave
and
pour
out
its
lightning
.
<EOS>
a
long
delay
would
scarce
leave
daylight
for
my
return
,
so
I
rise
,
thank
the
father
for
his
hospitality
and
his
tale
,
<EOS>
be
benignantly
answer
by
a
"
pax
vobiscum
,
"
which
I
make
kindly
welcome
,
because
it
seem
uttered
with
a
true
benevolence
;
but
I
like
less
the
mystic
phrase
accompany
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
daughter
,
you
_
shall
_
be
what
you
_
shall
_
be
!
"
<EOS>
an
oracle
that
make
me
shrug
my
shoulder
as
soon
as
I
have
get
outside
the
door
.
<EOS>
few
of
us
know
what
we
be
to
come
to
certainly
,
but
for
all
that
have
happen
yet
,
I
have
good
hope
of
living
and
die
a
sober
-
minded
Protestant
:
there
be
a
hollowness
within
,
and
a
flourish
around
"
Holy
Church
"
which
tempt
me
but
moderately
.
<EOS>
I
go
on
my
way
ponder
many
thing
.
<EOS>
whatever
Romanism
may
be
,
there
be
good
Romanists
:
this
man
,
Emanuel
,
seem
of
the
good
;
touch
with
superstition
,
influence
by
priestcraft
,
yet
wondrous
for
fond
faith
,
for
pious
devotion
,
for
sacrifice
of
self
,
for
charity
unbounded
.
<EOS>
It
remain
to
see
how
Rome
,
by
her
agent
,
handle
such
quality
;
whether
she
cherish
them
for
their
own
sake
and
for
God
's
,
or
put
them
out
to
usury
and
make
booty
of
the
interest
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
time
I
reach
home
,
it
be
sundown
.
<EOS>
Goton
have
kindly
save
me
a
portion
of
dinner
,
which
indeed
I
need
.
<EOS>
She
call
me
into
the
little
cabinet
to
partake
of
it
,
and
there
Madame
Beck
soon
make
her
appearance
,
bring
me
a
glass
of
wine
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
begin
she
,
chuckle
,
"
and
what
sort
of
a
reception
do
<EOS>
Madame
Walravens
give
you
?
<EOS>
Elle
est
drôle
,
n'est
-
ce
pas
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
tell
her
what
have
pass
,
deliver
verbatim
the
courteous
message
with
which
I
have
be
charge
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
la
singulière
petite
bossue
!
"
laugh
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Et
figurez
-
vous
qu'elle
<EOS>
me
déteste
,
parcequ'elle
me
<EOS>
croit
amoureuse
de
mon
cousin
Paul
;
ce
petit
dévot

<EOS>
n'ose
<EOS>
pas
bouger
,
à

que
son
confesseur
ne
lui
donne
la
permission

<EOS>
au

"
<EOS>
(
she
go
on
)
,
"
if
he
want
to
marry
ever
so
much
 
<EOS>
soit
moi
,
soit
<EOS>
une
<EOS>
autre
 
<EOS>
he
could
not
do
it
;
he
have
too
large
a
family
already
on
his
hand
:
<EOS>
Mère
Walravens
,
Père
Silas
,
Dame
Agnes
,
and
a
whole
troop
of
nameless
pauper
.
<EOS>
there
never
be
a
man
like
him
for
lay
on
himself
burden
great
than
he
can
bear
,
voluntarily
incur
needless
responsibility
.
<EOS>
besides
,
he
harbour
a
romantic
idea
about
some
pale
-
faced
Marie
Justine
 
personnage
<EOS>
assez
niaise

(
such
be
Madame

irreverent
remark

"
who
have
be
an
angel

elsewhere

this

oh

you
would

you

crotchet
and
eccentricity

I

<EOS>
so
say
Madame
Beck
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
be
a
wise
woman
,
but
she
should
not
have
utter
those
word
.
<EOS>
to
do
so
be
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
that
night
she
should
have
leave
me
calm
 
not
excited
,
indifferent
,
not
interested
,
isolate
in
my
own
estimation
and
that
of
other
 
not
connect
,
even
in
idea
,
with
this
second
person
whom
I
be
to
forget
.
  
<EOS>
forget
him
?
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
they
take
a
sage
plan
to
make
me
forget
him
 
the
wisehead
!
<EOS>
They
show
me
how
good
he
be
;
they
make
of
my
dear
little
man
a
stainless
little
hero
.
<EOS>
and
then
they
have
prate
about
his
manner
of
loving
.
<EOS>
what
mean
have
I
,
before
this
day
,
of
be
certain
whether
he
could
love
at
all
or
not
?
  
<EOS>
I
have
know
him
jealous
,
suspicious
;
I
have
see
about
him
certain
tenderness
,
fitfulnesse
 
<EOS>
a
softness
which
come
like
a
warm
air
,
and
a
ruth
which
pass
like
early
dew
,
dry
in
the
heat
of
his
irritability
:
_
<EOS>
this
_
be
all
I
have
see
.
<EOS>
and
they
,
Père
Silas
and
Modeste
Maria
Beck
(
that
these
two
work
in
concert
<EOS>
I
could
not
doubt
)
open
up
the
adytum
of
his
heart
 
<EOS>
show
me
one
grand
love
,
the
child
of
this
southern
nature
's
youth
,
bear
so
strong
and
perfect
,
that
it
have
laugh
at
death
himself
,
despise
his
mean
rape
of
matter
,
clung
to
immortal
spirit
,
and
in
victory
and
faith
,
have
watch
beside
a
tomb
twenty
year
.
  
<EOS>
this
have
be
do
 
not
idly
:
this
be
not
a
mere
hollow
indulgence
of
sentiment
;
he
have
prove
his
fidelity
by
the
consecration
of
his
good
energy
to
an
unselfish
purpose
,
and
attest
it
by
limitless
personal
sacrifice
:
for
those
once
dear
to
her
<EOS>
he
prize
 
<EOS>
he
have
lay
down
vengeance
,
and
take
up
a
cross
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
as
for
Justine
Marie
,
I
know
what
she
be
as
well
as
if
I
have
see
her
.
<EOS>
I
know
she
be
well
enough
;
there
be
girl
like
her
in
Madame
Beck
's
school
 
phlegmatic
 
pale
,
slow
,
inert
,
but
kind
-
natured
,
neutral
of
evil
,
undistinguished
for
good
.
  
<EOS>
if
she
wear
angel
'
wing
,
I
know
whose
poet
-
fancy
confer
them
.
<EOS>
if
her
forehead
shine
luminous
with
the
reflex
of
a
halo
,
I
know
in
the
fire
of
whose
irid
that
circlet
of
holy
flame
have
generation
.
  
<EOS>
be
I
,
then
,
to
be
frighten
by
Justine
Marie
?
<EOS>
be
the
picture
of
a
pale
dead
nun
to
rise
,
an
eternal
barrier
?
<EOS>
and
what
of
the
charity
which
absorb
his
worldly
good
?
<EOS>
what
of
his
heart
swear
to
virginity
?
  
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
 
<EOS>
Père
Silas
 
<EOS>
you
should
not
have
suggest
these
question
.
<EOS>
They
be
at
once
the
deep
puzzle
,
the
strong
obstruction
,
and
the
keen
stimulus
,
I
have
ever
feel
.
<EOS>
for
a
week
of
night
and
day
I
fall
asleep
 
<EOS>
I
dreamt
,
and
I
wake
upon
these
two
question
.
<EOS>
in
the
whole
world
there
be
no
answer
to
them
,
except
where
one
dark
little

after
that
visit

the

want
to
see
him
again

<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
 
know
what
I
now
know
 
his
countenance
would
offer
a
page
more
lucid
,
more
interesting
than
ever
;
I
feel
a
longing
to
trace
in
it
the
imprint
of
that
primitive
devotedness
,
the
sign
of
that
half
-
knightly
,
half
-
saintly
chivalry
which
the
priest
's
narrative
impute
to
his
nature
.
<EOS>
He
have
become
my
christian
hero

under

character
I
want
to
view
him
.
  
<EOS>
nor

opportunity
slow

;

test
the
next

<EOS>
yes
:
I
be
grant
an
interview
with
my
"
christian
hero
"
 
an
interview
not
very
heroic
,
or
sentimental
,
or
biblical
,
but
lively
enough
in
its
way
.
  
<EOS>
about
three
o'clock
of

the
peace
of

I

a
sudden
fracture
by
the
wild
inburst

a

with

of

<EOS>
(

I
sit
bent

an
elaborate

tediously
work
up
my
copy
to
the
finish
of
the
original
,
for
that
<EOS>
be
my
practical
notion
of
art
;
and
,
strange
to
say
,
I
take
extreme
pleasure
in
the
labour
,
and
could
even
produce
curiously
finical
chinese
facsimile
of
steel
or
mezzotint
plate
 
thing
about
as
valuable
as
so
many

I

pretty
well

what
be
the
matter

<EOS>
My
drawing
,
my
pencil

my
precious

into
one
crush

perish
from

I
myself
appear

<EOS>
have
partially
collect
my
scared

I
find
myself
in
the
presence
of
two
man

gentleman

I
suppose
I
should
say
 
one
dark

the
other
light
 
one
have
a
stiff

half

military
air

and
wear
a

the
other
partaking

in
garb

bear

more
of
the
careless
aspect
of
the
student

artist
class

both
flourish
in
full
magnificence

imperial

<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
stand
a
little
apart
from
these

his

strong

here

Messieurs

a

of
cold

blooded
fop

sceptic

<EOS>
It
seem
that
M.

have
be
rashly
exhibit
something
I
have
write
 
something
,
he
have
never
once
praise
,
or
even
mention
,
in
my
hearing
,
and
which
I
deem
forget

<EOS>
the
essay
be
not
remarkable
at
all
;
it
only
_
seem
_
remarkable
,
compare
with
the
average
production
of
foreign
school

girl
;
in
an
english
establishment
it
would
have
pass
scarce
notice
.
<EOS>
Messieurs
Boissec
and
Rochemorte
have
think
proper
to
question
its
genuineness
,
and
insinuate
a
cheat
;
I
be
now
to
bear
my
testimony
to
the
truth
,
and
to
be
put
to
the
torture
of
their
examination
.
  
<EOS>
a
memorable
scene
ensue
.
  
<EOS>
They
begin
with
classic
.
<EOS>
a
dead
blank
.
<EOS>
They
go
on
to
french
history
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
Mérovée
from
Pharamond
.
<EOS>
They
try
me
in
various
"
ology
,
and
still
only
get
a
shake
of
the
head
,
and
an
unchanging
"
Je
n'en
sais
rien
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
an
expressive
pause
,
they
proceed
to
matter
of
general
information
,
broach
one
or
two
subject
which
I
know
pretty
well
,
and
on
which
I
have
often
reflect
.
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
,
who
have
hitherto
stand
look
on
,
dark
as
the
winter
-
solstice
,
brighten
up
somewhat
;
he
think
I
should
now
show
myself
at
least
no
fool
.
  
<EOS>
He
learn
his
error
.
<EOS>
though
answer
to
the
question
surge
up
fast
,
my
mind
fill
like
a
rise
<EOS>
well
,
idea
be
there
,
but
not
word
.
<EOS>
I
either
_
<EOS>
could
_
not
,
or
_
would
_
not
speak
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
sure
which
:
partly
,
I
think
,
my
nerve
have
get
wrong
,
and
partly
my
humour
be
cross
.
  
<EOS>
I
hear
one
of
my
examiner
 
he
of
the
braid
surtout
 
whisper
to
his
co
-
professor
,
"
Est
-
elle
donc
idiote
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
think
,
"
an
idiot
she
be
,
and
always
will
be
,
for
such
as
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
I
suffer
 
suffer
cruelly
;
I
see
the
damp
gather
on
M.
Paul
's
brow
,
and
his
eye
speak
a
passionate
yet
sad
reproach
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
believe
in
my
total
lack
of
popular
cleverness
;
he
think
I
_
could
_
be
prompt
if
I
_
would
_
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
to
relieve
him
,
the
professor
,
and
myself
,
I
stammer
out
:
  
"
<EOS>
gentleman
,
you
have
better
let
me
go
;
you
will
get
no
good
of
me
;
as
you
say
,
I
be
an
idiot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
have
speak
with
calm
and
dignity
,
or
I
wish
my
sense
have
suffice
to
make
me
hold
my
tongue
;
that
traitor
tongue
trip
,
falter
.
<EOS>
behold
the
judge
cast
on
M.
Emanuel
a
hard
look
of
triumph
,
and
hear
the
distressed
tremor
of
my
own
voice
,
out
I
burst
in
a
fit
of
choke
tear
.
<EOS>
the
emotion
be
far
more
of
anger
than
grief
;
have
I
be
a
man
and
strong
,
I
could
have
challenge
that
pair
on
the
spot
 
<EOS>
but
it
_
be
_
emotion
,
and
I
would
rather
have
be
scourge
than
betray
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
incapable
!
<EOS>
Could
they
not
see
at
once
the
crude
hand
of
a
novice
in
that
composition
they
call
a
forgery
?
<EOS>
the
subject
be
classical
.
<EOS>
when
M.
Paul
dictate
the
trait
on
which
the
essay
be
to
turn
,
I
hear
it
for
the
first
time
;
the
matter
be
new
to
me
,
and
I
have
no
material
for
its
treatment
.
<EOS>
but
I
get
book
,
read
up
the
fact
,
laboriously
construct
a
skeleton
out
of
the
dry
bone
of
the
real
,
and
then
clothe
them
,
and
try
to
breathe
into
them
life
,
and
in
this
last
aim
I
have
pleasure
.
<EOS>
with
me
it
be
a
difficult
and
anxious
time
till
my
fact
be
find
,
select
,
and
properly
joint
;
nor
could
I
rest
from
research
and
effort
till
I
be
satisfied
of
correct
anatomy
;
the
strength
of
my
inward
repugnance
to
the
idea
of
flaw
or
falsity
sometimes
enable
me
to
shun
egregious
blunder
;
but
the
knowledge
be
not
there
in
my
head
,
ready
and
mellow
;
it
have
not
be
sow
in
Spring
,
grow
in
Summer
,
harvest
in
Autumn
,
and
garner
through
Winter
;
whatever
I
want
I
must
go
out
and
gather
fresh
;
glean
of
wild
herb
my
lapful
,
and
shre
them
green
into
the
pot
.
<EOS>
Messieurs
Boissec
and
Rochemorte
do
not
perceive
this
.
<EOS>
They
mistake
my
work
for
the
work
of
a
ripe
scholar
.
  
<EOS>
They
would
not
yet
let
me
go
:
I
must
sit
down
and
write
before
them
.
<EOS>
as
I
dip
my
pen
in
the
ink
with
a
shake
hand
,
and
survey
the
white
paper
with
eye
half
-
blind
and
overflowing

begin
mincingly
to
apologize

<EOS>
blank

there

M.

his

<EOS>
at
these

<EOS>
I
be
gather
my
courage
to
tell
them
that
I

neither

another

for
their
satisfaction

that

M.

all

I

when
suddenly

I
see
her
in

the
den

confusion

servant

order
or
help
which
she

beggar
stand
at

wait

crawl
round

hurriedly

after

M.

of

<EOS>
not

M.

half
apologize
;
he
half
regret
,
too

the
fitfulness
of
his
mood
at
all

he
hint
that
some
allowance
ought

I

a

assurance

countless

unhoped

Ere
I
could
answer
,
Fifine
Beck
burst
in
,
rosy
and
abrupt
,
call
out
that
I
be
want
.
<EOS>
Her

go
into
town
to
call
on
some
english

who
have

my

<EOS>
the
interruption
be
not
unseasonable
:
sufficient
for
the
day
be
always
the
evil
;
for
this
hour
,
its
good
sufficed
.
<EOS>
yet
I
should
have
like
to
ask
M.
Paul
whether
the
"
morbid
fancy
,
"
against
which
he
warn
me
,
work
in
his

brain

<EOS>
the
APPLE
of
DISCORD

<EOS>
besides
Fifine
Beck
's
mother
,
another
power
have
a
word
to
say
to
M.
Paul
and
me
,
before
that
covenant
of
friendship
could
be
ratify
.
<EOS>
We
be
under
the
surveillance
of
a
sleepless
eye
:
<EOS>
Rome
watch
jealously
her
son
through
that
mystic
lattice
at
which
I
have
knelt
once
,
and
to
which
M.
Emanuel
draw
nigh
month
by
month
 
<EOS>
the
slide
panel
of
the
confessional
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
be
you
so
glad
to
be
friend
with
M.
Paul
?
"
ask
the
reader
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
he
not
long
be
a
friend
to
you
?
<EOS>
have
he
not
give
proof
on
proof
of
a
certain
partiality
in
his
feeling
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
yes
,
he
have
;
but
still
I
like
to
hear
him
say
so
earnestly
 
that
he
be
my
close
,
true
friend
;
I
like
his
modest
doubt
,
his
tender
deference
 
that
trust
which
long
to
rest
,
and
be
grateful
when
teach
how
.
<EOS>
He
have
call
me
"
sister
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
well
.
<EOS>
yes
;
he
may
call
me
what
he
please
,
so
long
as
he
confide
in
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
willing
to
be
his
sister
,
on
condition
that
he
do
not
invite
me
to
fill
that
relation
to
some
future
wife
of
his
;
and
tacitly
vow
as
he
be
to
celibacy
,
of
this
dilemma
there
seem
little
danger
.
  
<EOS>
through
most
of
the
succeed
night
I
ponder
that
evening
's
interview
.
<EOS>
I
want
much
the
morning
to
break
,
and
then
listen
for
the
bell
to
ring
;
and
,
after
rise
and
dress
,
I
deem
prayer
and
breakfast
slow
,
and
all
the
hour
linger
,
till
that
arrive
at
last
which
bring
me
the
lesson
of
literature
.
<EOS>
My
wish
be
to
get
a
more
thorough
comprehension
of
this
fraternal
alliance
:
to
note
with
how
much
of
the
brother
he
would
demean
himself
when
we
meet
again
;
to
prove
how
much
of
the
sister
be
in
my
own
feeling
;
to
discover
whether
I
could
summon
a
sister
's
courage
,
and
he
a
brother
's
frankness
.
  
<EOS>
He
come
.
<EOS>
life
be
so
construct
,
that
the
event
do
not
,
can
not
,
will
not
,
match
the
expectation
.
<EOS>
that
whole
day
he
never
accost
me
.
<EOS>
His
lesson
be
give
rather
more
quietly
than
usual
,
more
mildly
,
and
also
more
gravely
.
<EOS>
He
be
fatherly
to
his
pupil
,
but
he
be
not
brotherly
to
me
.
<EOS>
Ere
he
leave
the
classe
,
I
expect
a
smile
,
if
not
a
word
;
I
get
neither
:
<EOS>
to
my
portion
fall
one
nod
 
<EOS>
hurry
,
shy
.
  
<EOS>
this
distance
,
I
argue
,
be
accidental
 
<EOS>
it
be
involuntary
;
patience
,
and
it
will
vanish
.
<EOS>
It
vanish
not
;
it
continue
for
day
;
it
increase
.
<EOS>
I
suppress
my
surprise
,
and
swallow
whatever
other
feeling
begin
to
surge
.
  
<EOS>
well
may
I
ask
when
he
offer
fraternity
 
<EOS>
"
dare
<EOS>
I
rely
on
you
?
<EOS>
"
well
may
he
,
doubtless
know
himself
,
withhold
all
pledge
.
<EOS>
true
,
he
have
bid
me
make
my
own
experiment
 
tease
and
try
him
.
<EOS>
vain
injunction
!
<EOS>
privilege
nominal
and
unavailable
!
<EOS>
some
woman
may
use
it
!
<EOS>
nothing
in
my
power
or
instinct
place
me
amongst
this
brave
band
.
<EOS>
leave
alone
,
I
be
passive
;
repulse
,
I
withdraw
;
forget
 
my
lip
would
not
utter
,
nor
my
eye
dart
a
reminder
.
<EOS>
It
seem
there
have
be
an
error
somewhere
in
my
calculation
,
and
I
want
for
time
to
disclose
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
day
come
when
,
as
usual
,
he
be
to
give
me
a
lesson
.
<EOS>
one
evening
in
seven
he
have
long
generously
bestow
on
me
,
devote
it
to
the
examination
of
what
have
be
do
in
various
study
during
the
past
week
,
and
to
the
preparation
of
work
for
the
week
in
prospect
.
<EOS>
on
these
occasion
my
schoolroom
be
anywhere
,
wherever
the
pupil
and
the
other
teacher
happen
to
be
,
or
in
their
close
vicinage
,
very
often
in
the
large
second
division
,
where
it
be
easy
to
choose
a
quiet
nook
when
the
crowd
day
pupil
be
absent
,
and
the
few
boarder
gather
in
a
knot
about
the
surveillante
's
estrade
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
customary
evening
,
hear
the
customary
hour
strike
,
I
collect
my
book
and
paper
,
my
pen
and
ink
,
and
seek
the
large
division
.
  
<EOS>
in
classe
there
be
no
one
,
and
it
lie
all
in
cool
deep
shadow
;
but
through
the
open
double
door
be
see
the
carré
,
fill
with
pupil
and
with
light
;
over
hall
and
figure
blush
the
westere
sun
.
<EOS>
It
blush
so
ruddily
and
vividly
,
that
the
hue
of
the
wall
and
the
variegate
tint
of
the
dress
seem
all
fuse
in
one
warm
glow
.
<EOS>
the
girl
be
seat
,
work
or
study
;
in
the
midst
of
their
circle
stand
M.
Emanuel
,
speak
good
-
humouredly
to
a
teacher
.
<EOS>
His
dark
paletôt
,
his
jetty
hair
,
be
tinge
with
many
a
reflex
of
crimson
;
his
spanish
face
,
when
he
turn
it
momentarily
,
answer
the
sun
's
animate
kiss
with
an
animate
smile
.
<EOS>
I
take
my
place
at
a
desk
.
  
<EOS>
the
orange
-
tree
,
and
several
plant
,
full
and
bright
with
bloom
,
bask
also
in
the
sun
's
laughing
bounty
;
they
have
partake
it
the
whole
day
,
and
now
ask
water
.
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
have
a
taste
for
gardening
;
he
like
to
tend
and
foster
plant
.
<EOS>
I
use
to
think
that
work
amongst
shrub
with
a
spade
or
a
watering
-
pot
soothe
his
nerve
;
it
be
a
recreation
to
which
he
often
have
recourse
;
and
now
he
look
to
the
orange
-
tree
,
the
geranium
,
the
gorgeous
cactus
,
and
revive
them
all
with
the
refreshment
their
drought
need
.
<EOS>
His
lip
meantime
sustain
his
precious
cigar
,
that
(
for
him
)
first
necessary
and
prime
luxury
of
life
;
its
blue
wreath
curl
prettily
enough
amongst
the
flower
,
and
in
the
evening
light
.
<EOS>
He
speak
no
more
to
the
pupil
,
nor
to
the
mistress
,
but
give
many
an
endearing
word
to
a
small
spanieless
(
if
one
may
coin
a
word
)
,
that
nominally
belong
to
the
house
,
but
virtually
own
him
as
master
,
be
fonder
of
him
than
any
inmate
.
<EOS>
a
delicate
,
silky
,
loving
,
and
lovable
little
doggie
<EOS>
she
be
,
trot
at
his
side
,
look
with
expressive
,
attach
eye
into
his
face
;
and
whenever
he
drop
his
bonnet
-
grec
or
his
handkerchief
,
which
he
occasionally
do
in
play
,
crouch
beside
it
with
the
air
of
a
miniature
lion
guard
a
kingdom
's
flag
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
many
plant
,
and
as
the
amateur
gardener
fetch
all
the
water
from
the
well
in
the
court
,
with
his
own
active
hand
,
his
work
spin
on
to
some
length
.
<EOS>
the
great
school
-
clock
tick
on
.
<EOS>
another
hour
strike
.
<EOS>
the
carré
and
the
youthful
group
lose
the
illusion
of
sunset
.
<EOS>
day
be
droop
.
<EOS>
My
lesson
,
I
perceive
,
must
to
-
night
be
very
short
;
but
the
orange
-
tree
,
the
cacti
,
the
camelia
be
all
serve
now
.
<EOS>
be
it
my
turn
?
  
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
in
the
garden
be
more
plant
to
be
look
after
,
 
favourite
rose
-
bush
,
certain
choice
flower
;
little
Sylvie
's
glad
bark
and
whine
follow
the
recede
paletôt
down
the
alley
.
<EOS>
I
put
up
some
of
my
book
;
I
should
not
want
them
all
;
I
sit
and
think
;
and
wait
,
involuntarily
deprecate
the
creep
invasion
of
twilight
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvie
,
gaily
frisk
,
emerge
into
view
once
more
,
herald
the
return
paletôt
;
the
watering
-
pot
be
deposit
beside
the
well
;
it
have
fulfil
its
office
;
how
glad
I
be
!
<EOS>
Monsieur
wash
his
hand
in
a
little
stone
bowl
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
long
time
for
a
lesson
now
;
ere
long
the
prayer
-
bell
must
ring
;
but
still
we
should
meet
;
he
would
speak
;
a
chance
would
be
offer
of
read
in
his
eye
the
riddle
of
his
shyness
.
<EOS>
His
ablution
over
,
he
stand
,
slowly
re
-
arrange
his
cuff
,
look
at
the
horn
of
a
young
moon
,
set
pale
in
the
opal
sky
,
and
glimmer
faint
on
the
oriel
of
Jean
Baptiste
.
<EOS>
Sylvie
watch
the
mood
contemplative
;
its
stillness
irk
her
;
she
whine
and
jump
to
break
it
.
<EOS>
He
look
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
petite
exigeante
,
"
say
he
;
"
you
must
not
be
forget
one
moment
,
it
seem
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
stop
,
lift
her
in
his
arm
,
saunter
across
the
court
,
within
a
yard
of
the
line
of
window
near
one
of
which
I
sit
:
he
saunter
lingeringly
,
fondle
the
spaniel
in
his
bosom
,
call
her
tender
name
in
a
tender
voice
.
<EOS>
on
the
front
-
door
step
he
turn
;
once
again
he
look
at
the
moon
,
at
the
grey
cathedral
,
over
the
remoter
spire
and
house
-
roof
fade
into
a
blue
sea
of
night
-
mist
;
he
taste
the
sweet
breath
of
dusk
,
and
note
the
fold
bloom
of
the
garden
;
he
suddenly
look
round
;
a
keen
beam
out
of
his
eye
rase
the
white
façade
of
the
class
,
sweep
the
long
line
of
croisées
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
bow
;
if
he
do
,
I
have
no
time
to
return
the
courtesy
.
<EOS>
in
a
moment
he
be
go
;
the
moonlit
threshold
lie
pale
and
shadowless
before
the
closed
front
door
.
  
<EOS>
gather
in
my
arm
all
that
be
spread
on
the
desk
before
me
,
I
carry
back
the
unused
heap
to
its
place
in
the
third
classe
.
<EOS>
the
prayer
-
bell
rang
;
I
obey
its
summon
.
  
<EOS>
the
morrow
would
not
restore
him
to
the
Rue
Fossette
,
that
day
be
devote
entirely
to
his
college
.
<EOS>
I
get
through
my
teaching
;
I
get
over
the
intermediate
hour
;
I
see
evening
approaching
,
and
arm
myself
for
its
heavy
ennuis
.
<EOS>
whether
it
be
bad
to
stay
with
my
co
-
inmate
,
or
to
sit
alone
,
I
have
not
consider
;
I
naturally
take
up
the
latter
alternative
;
if
there
be
a
hope
of
comfort
for
any
moment
,
the
heart
or
head
of
no
human
being
in
this
house
could
yield
it
;
only
under
the
lid
of
my
desk
could
it
harbour
,
nestle
between
the
leave
of
some
book
,
gild
a
pencil
-
point
,
the
nib
of
a
pen
,
or
tinge
the
black
fluid
in
that
ink
-
glass
.
<EOS>
with
a
heavy
heart
I
open
my
desk
-
lid
;
with
a
weary
hand
I
turn
up
its
content
.
  
<EOS>
one
by
one
,
well
-
accustom
book
,
volume
sew
in
familiar
cover
,
be
take
out
and
put
back
hopeless
:
<EOS>
they
have
no
charm
;
they
could
not
comfort
.
<EOS>
be
this
something
new
,
this
pamphlet
in
lilac
?
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
it
before
,
and
I
re
-
arrange
my
desk
this
very
day
 
<EOS>
this
very
afternoon
;
the
tract
must
have
be
introduce
within
the
last
hour
,
while
we
be
at
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
I
open
it
.
<EOS>
what
be
it
?
<EOS>
what
would
it
say
to
me
?
  
<EOS>
It
be
neither
tale
nor
poem
,
neither
essay
nor
history
;
it
neither
sing
,
nor
relate
,
not
discuss
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
theological
work
;
it
preach
and
it
persuade
.
  
<EOS>
I
lend
to
it
my
ear
very
willingly
,
for
,
small
as
it
be
,
it
possess
its
own
spell
,
and
bind
my
attention
at
once
.
<EOS>
It
preach
Romanism
;
it
persuade
to
conversion
.
<EOS>
the
voice
of
that
sly
little
book
be
a
honeyed
voice
;
its
accent
be
all
unction
and
balm
.
<EOS>
here
roar
no
utterance
of
Rome
's
thunder
,
no
blasting
of
the
breath
of
her
displeasure
.
<EOS>
the
Protestant
be
to
turn
Papist
,
not
so
much
in
fear
of
the
heretic
's
hell
,
as
on
account
of
the
comfort
,
the
indulgence
,
the
tenderness
Holy
Church
offer
:
<EOS>
far
be
it
from
her
to
threaten
or
to
coerce
;
her
wish
be
to
guide
and
win
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
persecute
?
<EOS>
oh
dear
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
not
on
any
account
!
  
<EOS>
this
meek
volume
be
not
address
to
the
harden
and
worldly
;
it
be
not
even
strong
meat
for
the
strong
:
it
be
milk
for
babe
:
the
mild
effluence
of
a
mother
's
love
towards
her
tender
and
her
young
;
intend
wholly
and
solely
for
those
whose
head
be
to
be
reach
through
the
heart
.
<EOS>
Its
appeal
be
not
to
intellect
;
it
seek
to
win
the
affectionate
through
their
affection
,
the
sympathizing
through
their
sympathy
:
St.
Vincent
de
Paul
,
gather
his
orphan
about
him
,
never
speak
more
sweetly
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
one
capital
inducement
to
apostacy
be
hold
out
in
the
fact
that
the
Catholic
who
have
lose
dear
friend
by
death
could
enjoy
the
unspeakable
solace
of
pray
them
out
of
purgatory
.
<EOS>
the
writer
do
not
touch
on
the
firm
peace
of
those
whose
belief
dispense
with
purgatory
altogether
:
<EOS>
but
I
think
of
this
;
and
,
on
the
whole
,
prefer
the
latter
doctrine
as
the
most
consolatory
.
<EOS>
the
little
book
amuse
,
and
do
not
painfully
displease
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
canting
,
sentimental
,
shallow
little
book
,
yet
something
about
it
cheer
my
gloom
and
make
me
smile
;
I
be
amuse
with
the
gambol
of
this
unlicked
wolf
-
cub
muffle
in
the
fleece
,
and
mimic
the
bleat
of
a
guileless
lamb
.
<EOS>
portion
of
it
remind
me
of
certain
Wesleyan
Methodist
tract
I
have
once
read
when
a
child
;
they
be
flavour
with
about
the
same
seasoning
of
excitation
to
fanaticism
.
<EOS>
He
that
have
write
it
be
no
bad
man
,
and
while
perpetually
betray
the
train
cunning
 
<EOS>
the
cloven
hoof
of
his
system
 
<EOS>
I
should
pause
before
accuse
himself
of
insincerity
.
<EOS>
His
judgment
,
however
,
want
surgical
prop
;
it
be
rickety
.
  
<EOS>
I
smile
then
over
this
dose
of
maternal
tenderness
,
come
from
the
ruddy
old
lady
of
the
Seven
Hills
;
smile
,
too
,
at
my
own
disinclination
,
not
to
say
disability
,
to
meet
these
melt
favour
.
<EOS>
glance
at
the
title
-
page
,
I
find
the
name
of
"
Père
Silas
.
"
<EOS>
a
fly
-
leaf
bore
in
small
,
but
clear
and
well
-
know
pencil
character
:
"
from
P.
C.
D.
E.
to
L
 
y.
"
<EOS>
and
when
I
see
this
I
laugh
:
but
not
in
my
former
spirit
.
<EOS>
I
be
revive
.
  
<EOS>
a
mortal
bewilderment
clear
suddenly
from
my
head
and
vision
;
the
solution
of
the
Sphinx
-
riddle
be
win
;
the
conjunction
of
those
two
name
,
Père
Silas
and
Paul
Emanuel
,
give
the
key
to
all
.
<EOS>
the
penitent
have
be
with
his
director
;
permit
to
withhold
nothing
;
suffer
to
keep
no
corner
of
his
heart
sacred
to
God
and
to
himself
;
the
whole
narrative
of
our
late
interview
have
be
draw
from
him
;
he
have
avow
the
covenant
of
fraternity
,
and
speak
of
his
adopt
sister
.
<EOS>
how
could
such
a
covenant
,
such
adoption
,
be
sanction
by
the
Church
?
<EOS>
fraternal
communion
with
a
heretic
!
<EOS>
I
seem
to
hear
Père
Silas
annul
the
unholy
pact
;
warn
his
penitent
of
its
peril
;
entreat
,
enjoin
reserve
,
nay
,
by
the
authority
of
his
office
,
and
in
the
name
,
and
by
the
memory
of
all
M.
Emanuel
hold
most
dear
and
sacred
,
command
the
enforcement
of
that
new
system
whose
frost
have
pierce
to
the
marrow
of
my
bone
.
  
<EOS>
these
may
not
seem
pleasant
hypothesis
;
yet
,
by
comparison
,
they
be
welcome
.
<EOS>
the
vision
of
a
ghostly
troubler
hovering
in
the
background
,
be
as
nothing
,
match
with
the
fear
of
spontaneous
change
arise
in
M.
Paul
himself
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
distance
of
time
,
I
can
not
be
sure
how
far
the
above
conjecture
be
self
-
suggest
:
or
in
what
measure
they
owe
their
origin
and
confirmation
to
another
quarter
.
<EOS>
help
be
not
want
.
  
<EOS>
this
evening
there
be
no
bright
sunset
:
<EOS>
west
and
east
be
one
cloud
;
no
summer
night
-
mist
,
blue
,
yet
rise
-
tinge
,
soften
the
distance
;
a
clammy
fog
from
the
marsh
creep
grey
round
Villette
.
<EOS>
to
-
night
the
watering
-
pot
may
rest
in
its
niche
by
the
well
:
a
small
rain
have
be
drizzle
all
the
afternoon
,
and
still
it
fall
fast
and
quietly
.
<EOS>
this
be
no
weather
for
ramble
in
the
wet
alley
,
under
the
drip
tree
;
and
I
start
to
hear
Sylvie
's
sudden
bark
in
the
garden
 
her
bark
of
welcome
.
<EOS>
surely
she
be
not
accompany
and
yet
this
glad
,
quick
bark
be
never
utter
,
save
in
homage
to
one
presence
.
  
<EOS>
through
the
glass
door
and
the
arching
berceau
,
I
command
the
deep
vista
of
the
allée
défendue
:
<EOS>
thither
rush
Sylvie
,
glisten
through
its
gloom
like
a
white
guelder
-
rise
.
<EOS>
She
run
to
and
fro
,
whining
,
springing
,
harass
little
bird
amongst
the
bush
.
<EOS>
I
watch
five
minute
;
no
fulfilment
follow
the
oman
.
<EOS>
I
return
to
my
book
;
Sylvie
's
sharp
bark
suddenly
cease
.
<EOS>
again
I
look
up
.
<EOS>
She
be
stand
not
many
yard
distant
,
wag
her
white
feathery
tail
as
fast
as
the
muscle
would
work
,
and
intently
watch
the
operation
of
a
spade
,
ply
fast
by
an
indefatigable
hand
.
<EOS>
there
be
M.
Emanuel
,
bent
over
the
soil
,
dig
in
the
wet
mould
amongst
the
rain
-
laden
and
stream
shrub
,
work
as
hard
as
if
his
day
's
pittance
be
yet
to
earn
by
the
literal
sweat
of
his
brow
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
sign
I
read
a
ruffled
mood
.
<EOS>
He
would
dig
thus
in
frozen
snow
on
the
cold
winter
day
,
when
urge
inwardly
by
painful
emotion
,
whether
of
nervous
excitation
,
or
,
sad
thought
of
self
-
reproach
.
<EOS>
He
would
dig
by
the
hour
,
with
knit
brow
and
set
tooth
,
nor
once
lift
his
head
,
or
open
his
lip
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvie
watch
till
she
be
tired
.
<EOS>
again
scamper
devious
,
bound
here
,
rush
there
,
snuff
and
sniff
everywhere
;
she
at
last
discover
me
in
classe
.
<EOS>
instantly
she
fly
bark
at
the
pane
,
as
if
to
urge
me
forth
to
share
her
pleasure
or
her
master
's
toil
;
she
have
see
me
occasionally
walk
in
that
alley
with
M.
Paul
;
and
I
doubt
not
,
consider
it
my
duty
to
join
him
now
,
wet
as
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
She
make
such
a
bustle
that
M.
Paul
at
last
look
up
,
and
of
course
perceive
why
,
and
at
whom
she
bark
.
<EOS>
He
whistle
to
call
her
off
;
she
only
bark
the
loud
.
<EOS>
She
seem
quite
bent
upon
have
the
glass
door
open
.
<EOS>
tired
,
I
suppose
,
with
her
importunity
,
he
throw
down
his
spade
,
approach
,
and
push
the
door
ajar
.
<EOS>
Sylvie
burst
in
all
impetuous
,
spring
to
my
lap
,
and
with
her
paw
at
my
neck
,
and
her
little
nose
and
tongue
somewhat
overpoweringly
busy
about
my
face
,
mouth
,
and
eye
,
flourish
her
bushy
tail
over
the
desk
,
and
scatter
book
and
paper
far
and
wide
.
  
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
advance
to
still
the
clamour
and
repair
the
disarrangement
.
<EOS>
have
gather
up
the
book
,
he
capture
Sylvie
,
and
stow
her
away
under
his
paletôt
,
where
she
nestle
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
,
her
head
just
peep
forth
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
tiny
,
and
have
the
pretty
little
innocent
face
,
the
silky
long
ear
,
the
fine
dark
eye
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
her
,
but
I
think
of
Paulina
de
Bassompierre
:
forgive
the
association
,
reader
,
it
_
would
_
occur
.
  
<EOS>
M.
Paul
pet
and
pat
her
;
the
endearment
she
receive
be
not
to
be
wonder
at
;
she
invite
affection
by
her
beauty
and
her
vivacious
life
.
  
<EOS>
while
caress
the
spaniel
,
his
eye
rove
over
the
paper
and
book
just
replace
;
it
settle
on
the
religious
tract
.
<EOS>
His
lip
move
;
he
half
check
the
impulse
to
speak
.
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
have
he
promise
never
to
address
me
more
?
<EOS>
if
so
,
his
well
nature
pronounce
the
vow
"
more
honour
in
the
breach
than
in
the
observance
,
"
for
with
a
second
effort
,
he
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
yet
read
the
brochure
,
I
presume
?
<EOS>
It
be
not
sufficiently
invite
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
reply
that
I
have
read
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
wait
,
as
if
wish
me
to
give
an
opinion
upon
it
unasked
.
<EOS>
unasked
,
however
,
I
be
in
no
mood
to
do
or
say
anything
.
<EOS>
if
any
concession
be
to
be
make
 
if
any
advance
be
demand
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
affair
of
the
very
docile
pupil
of
Père
Silas
,
not
mine
.
<EOS>
His
eye
settle
upon
me
gently
:
there
be
mildness
at
the
moment
in
its
blue
ray
 
<EOS>
there
be
solicitude
 
a
shade
of
pathos
;
there
be
meaning
composite
and
contrast
 
reproach
melt
into
remorse
.
<EOS>
at
the
moment
probably
,
he
would
have
be
glad
to
see
something
emotional
in
me
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
show
it
.
<EOS>
in
another
minute
,
however
,
I
should
have
betray
confusion
,
have
I
not
bethought
myself
to
take
some
quill
-
pen
from
my
desk
,
and
begin
soberly
to
mend
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
that
action
would
give
a
turn
to
his
mood
.
<EOS>
He
never
like
to
see
me
mend
pen
;
my
knife
be
always
dull
-
edged
 
my
hand
,
too
,
be
unskilful
;
I
hack
and
chip
.
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
I
cut
my
own
finger
 
half
on
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
restore
him
to
his
natural
state
,
to
set
him
at
his
ease
,
to
get
him
to
chide
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maladroit
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
at
last
,
"
she
will
make
mincemeat
of
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
put
Sylvie
down
,
make
her
lie
quiet
beside
his
bonnet
-
grec
,
and
,
deprive
me
of
the
pen
and
penknife
,
proceed
to
slice
,
nib
,
and
point
with
the
accuracy
and
celerity
of
a
machine
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
I
like
the
little
book
?
<EOS>
"
he
now
inquire
.
  
<EOS>
suppress
a
yawn
,
I
say
I
hardly
know
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
it
move
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
have
make
me
a
little
sleepy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
after
a
pause
:
)
"
allon
donc
!
<EOS>
It
be
of
no
use
take
that
tone
with
him
.
<EOS>
bad
as
I
be
 
<EOS>
and
he
should
be
sorry
to
have
to
name
all
my
fault
at
a
breath
 
<EOS>
God
and
nature
have
give
me
"
trop
de
sensibilité
et
de
sympathie
"
not
to
be
profoundly
affect
by
an
appeal
so
touching
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
I
respond
,
rouse
myself
quickly
,
"
I
be
not
affect
at
all
 
not
a
whit
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
in
proof
,
I
draw
from
my
pocket
a
perfectly
dry
handkerchief
,
still
clean
and
in
its
fold
.
  
<EOS>
Hereupon
I
be
make
the
object
of
a
string
of
stricture
rather
piquant
than
polite
.
<EOS>
I
listen
with
z
.
<EOS>
after
those
two
day
of
unnatural
silence
,
it
be
well
than
music
to
hear
M.
Paul
harangue
again
just
in
his
old
fashion
.
<EOS>
I
listen
,
and
meantime
solace
myself
and
Sylvie
with
the
content
of
a
bonbonnière
,
which
M.
Emanuel
's
gift
keep
well
supply
with
chocolate
comfit
:
It
please
him
to
see
even
a
small
matter
from
his
hand
duly
appreciate
.
<EOS>
He
look
at
me
and
the
spaniel
while
we
share
the
spoil
;
he
put
up
his
penknife
.
<EOS>
touch
my
hand
with
the
bundle
of
new
-
cut
quill
,
he
say
:
 
"
dite
donc
,
petite
soeur
 
speak
frankly
 
what
have
you
think
of
me
during
the
last
two
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
of
this
question
I
would
take
no
manner
of
notice
;
its
purport
make
my
eye
fill
.
<EOS>
I
caress
Sylvie
assiduously
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
,
lean
 
over
the
desk
,
bent
towards
me
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
call
myself
your
brother
,
"
he
say
:
"
I
hardly
know
what
I
be
 
<EOS>
brother
 
friend
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
think
of
you
 
<EOS>
I
feel
I
wish
,
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
well
 
<EOS>
but
I
must
check
myself
;
you
be
to
be
fear
.
<EOS>
My
good
friend
point
out
danger
,
and
whisper
caution
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
right
to
listen
to
your
friend
.
<EOS>
by
all
mean
be
cautious
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
your
religion
 
<EOS>
your
strange
,
self
-
reliant
,
invulnerable
creed
,
whose
influence
seem
to
clothe
you
in
,
I
know
not
what
,
unblessed
panoply
.
<EOS>
You
be
good
 
<EOS>
Père
Silas
call
you
good
,
and
love
you
 
but
your
terrible
,
proud
,
earnest
Protestantism
,
there
be
the
danger
.
<EOS>
It
express
itself
by
your
eye
at
time
;
and
again
,
it
give
you
certain
tone
and
certain
gesture
that
make
my
flesh
creep
.
<EOS>
You
be
not
demonstrative
,
and
yet
,
just
now
 
when
you
handle
that
tract
 
my
God
!
<EOS>
I
think
Lucifer
smile
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
I
do
not
respect
that
tract
 
<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
respect
that
tract
?
<EOS>
but
it
be
the
pure
essence
of
faith
,
love
,
charity
!
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
touch
you
:
in
its
gentleness
,
I
trust
that
it
could
not
fail
.
<EOS>
I
lay
it
in
your
desk
with
a
prayer
:
<EOS>
I
must
indeed
be
a
sinner
:
<EOS>
Heaven
will
not
hear
the
petition
that
come
warm
from
my
heart
.
<EOS>
You
scorn
my
little
offering
.
<EOS>
oh
,
cela
me
fait
mal
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
monsieur

I
do
not
scorn
it
 
at

,
not
as
your
gift

<EOS>
Monsieur

sit
down
;
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
a
heathen
,
I
be
not
hard
-
hearted
,
I
be
not
unchristian
,
I
be
not
dangerous
,
as
they
tell
you
;
I
would
not
trouble
your
faith
;
you
believe
in
God
and
Christ
and
the
Bible
,
and
so
do
I.
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
_
do
_
you
believe
in
the
Bible
?
<EOS>
do
you
receive
revelation
?
<EOS>
what
limit
be
there
to
the
wild
,
careless
daring
of
your
country
and
sect
.
<EOS>
Père
Silas
drop
dark
hint
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
by
dint
of
persuasion
,
I
make
him
half
-
define
these
hint
;
they
amount
to
crafty
Jesuit
-
slander
.
<EOS>
that
night
M.
Paul
and
I
talk
seriously
and
closely
.
<EOS>
He
plead
,
he
argue
.
<EOS>
_
I
_
could
not
argue
 
a
fortunate
incapacity
;
it
need
but
triumphant
,
logical
opposition
to
effect
all
the
director
wish
to
be
effect
;
but
I
could
talk
in
my
own
way
 
the
way
M.
Paul
be
use
to
 
and
of
which
he
could
follow
the
meandering
and
fill
the
hiatus
,
and
pardon
the
strange
stammering
,
strange
to
him
no
longer
.
<EOS>
at
ease
with
him
,
I
could
defend
my
creed
and
faith
in
my
own
fashion
;
in
some
degree
I
could
lull
his
prejudice
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
satisfied
when
he
go
away
,
hardly
be
he
appease
;
but
he
be
make
thoroughly
to
feel
that
Protestants
be
not
necessarily
the
irreverent
Pagans
his
director
have
insinuate
;
he
be
make
to
comprehend
something
of
their
mode
of
honour
the
Light
,
the
life
,
the
Word
;
he
be
enable
partly
to
perceive
that
,
while
their
veneration
for
thing
venerable
be
not
quite
like
that
cultivate
in
his
Church
,
it
have
<EOS>
its
own
,
perhaps
,
deep
power
 
<EOS>
its
own
more
solemn
awe
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
that
Père
Silas
(
himself
<EOS>
,
I
must
repeat
,
not
a
bad
man
,
though
the
advocate
of
a
bad
cause
)
have
darkly
stigmatize
Protestants
in
general
,
and
myself
by
inference
,
with
strange
name
,
have
ascribe
to
us
strange
"
ism
;
"
Monsieur
Emanuel
reveal
all
this
in
his
frank
fashion
,
which
know
not
secretiveness
,
look
at
me
as
he
speak
with
a
kind
,
earnest
fear
,
almost
tremble
lest
there
should
be
truth
in
the
charge
.
<EOS>
Père
Silas
,
it
seem
,
have
closely
watch
me
,
have
ascertain
that
I
go
by
turn
,
and
indiscriminately
,
to
the
three
Protestant
Chapels
of
Villette
 
<EOS>
the
french
,
german
,
and
English
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
i
would
<EOS>

_
,
the
Presbyterian
,
Lutheran

Episcopalian

<EOS>
such
liberality
argue
in
the
father
's
eye
profound
indifference
 
who
tolerate
all
,
he
reason
,
can
be
attach
to
none
.
<EOS>
now
,
it
happen
that
I
have
often
secretly
wonder
at
the
minute
and
unimportant
character
of
the
difference
between
these
three
sect
 
at
the
unity
and
identity
of
their
vital
doctrine
:
I
see
nothing
to
hinder
them
from
be
one
day
fuse
into
one
grand
Holy
Alliance
,
and
I
respect
them
all
,
though
I
think
that
in
each
there
be
fault
of
form
,
incumbrance
,
and
triviality
.
<EOS>
just
what
I
think
,
that
do
I
tell
M.
Emanuel
,
and
explain
to
him
that
my
own
last
appeal
,
the
guide
to
which
I
look
,
and
the
teacher
which
I
own
,
must
always
be
the
Bible
itself
,
rather
than
any
sect
,
of
whatever
name
or
nation
.
  
<EOS>
He
leave
me
soothe
,
yet
full
of
solicitude
,
breathe
a
wish
,
as
strong
as
a
prayer
,
that
if
I
be
wrong
,
Heaven
would
lead
me
right
.
<EOS>
I
hear
,
pour
forth
on
the
threshold
,
some
fervid
murmuring
to
"
Marie
,
Reine
du
Ciel
,
"
some
deep
aspiration
that
_
his
_
hope
may
yet
be
_
mine
_
.
  
<EOS>
strange
!
<EOS>
I
have
no
such
feverish
wish
to
turn
him
from
the
faith
of
his
father
.
<EOS>
I
think
Romanism
wrong
,
a
great
mixed
image
of
gold
and
clay
;
but
it
seem
to
me
that
_
<EOS>
this
_
Romanist
hold
the
purer
element
of
his
creed
with
an
innocency
of
heart
which
God
must
love
.
  
<EOS>
the
precede

between
eight
and
nine
o'clock
of
the
evening
,
in
a
schoolroom
of
the
quiet
Rue
Fossette
,
open
on
a
sequester
garden
.
<EOS>
probably
about
the

,
or
a
somewhat
later
hour
of

obedience

verbatim
in
an
attent

at
the
panel
of
a
confessional

hoary
church
of

<EOS>
It
ensue
that
Père
Silas
pay
a
visit
to
Madame
Beck

and
stir
by
I

not
what
mixture
of
motive
,
persuade
her
to
let
him
undertake
for
a
time
the
Englishwoman

spiritual
direction

<EOS>
Hereupon
I
be
put
through
a
course
of
reading
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
I
just
glance
at
the
book
lend
me
;
they
be
too
little
in
my
way
to
be
thoroughly
read
,
mark

learn
,
or
inwardly

<EOS>
and
besides
,
I
have
a
book
up

under
my

whereof
certain
chapter
satisfy
my
need
in

such

I
be

then
Père

me
the
fair
side
of
Rome
,
her
good
work

and
bade
<EOS>
me
judge
the
tree
by
its
fruit
.
  
<EOS>
in
answer
,
I
feel
and
I
avow
that
these
work
be
_
not
_
the

of

they

<EOS>
My
third
temptation
be
hold
out
in
the
pomp
of
Rome
 
the
glory
of
her
kingdom
.
<EOS>
I
be
take
to
the
church
on
solemn
occasion
 
day
of
fête
and
state
;
I
be
show
the
Papal
ritual
and
ceremonial
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
many
people
 
man
and
woman
 
no
doubt
far
<EOS>
my
superior
in
a
thousand
way
,
have
feel
this
display
impressive
,
have
declare
that
though
their
reason
protest
,
their
imagination
be
subjugate
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
the
same
.
<EOS>
neither
full
procession
,
nor
high
mass
,
nor
swarm
taper
,
nor
swinge
censer
,
nor
ecclesiastical
millinery

nor

touch

imagination
a
whit

<EOS>
what
I
see
strike
me
as
tawdry
,
not
grand
;
as
grossly
material
,
not
poetically
spiritual
.
  
<EOS>
this
I
do
not
tell
Père
Silas
;
he
be
old
,
he
look
venerable
:
through
every
abortive
experiment
,
under
every
repeat
disappointment
,
he
remain
personally
kind
to
me
,
and
I
feel
tender
of
hurt
his
feeling

<EOS>
but
on
the
evening
of
a
certain
day
when
,
from
the
balcony
of
a
great
house
,
I
have
be
make
to
witness
a
huge
mingled
procession
of
the
church
and
the
army
 
priest
with
relic
,
and
soldier
with
weapon
,
an
obese
and
aged
archbishop
,
habit
in
cambric
and
lace
,
look
strangely
like
a
grey
daw
in
bird
-
of
-
paradise
plumage
,
and
a
band
of
young
girl
fantastically
robe
and
garland
 
_
<EOS>
then
_
I
speak
my
mind
to
M.
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
like
it
,
"
I
tell
him
;
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
respect
such
ceremony
;
I
wish
to
see
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
have
relieve
my
conscience
by
this
declaration
,
I
be
able
to
go
on
,
and
,
speak
more
currently
and
clearly
than
my
will
not
,
to
show
him
that
I
have
a
mind
to
keep
to
my
reformed
creed
;
the
more
I
see
of
popery
the
closer
I
cling
to
protestantism
;
doubtless
there
be
error
in
every
church
,
but
I
now
perceive
by
contrast
<EOS>
how
severely
pure
be
my
own
,
compare
with
her
whose
paint
and
meretricious
face
have
be
unveil
for
my
admiration
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
how
we
keep
few
form
between
us
and
God
;
retain
,
indeed
,
no
more
than
,
perhaps
,
the
nature
of
mankind
in
the
mass
render
necessary
for
due
observance
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
could
not
look
on
flower
and
tinsel
,
on
wax
-
light
and
embroidery
,
at
such
time
and
under
such
circumstance
as
should
be
devoted
to
lift
the
secret
vision
to
Him
whose
home
be
infinity
,
and
<EOS>
His
be
 
Eternity
.
<EOS>
that
when
I
think
of
sin
and
sorrow
,
of
earthly
corruption
,
mortal
depravity
,
weighty
temporal
woe
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
care
for
chant
priest
or
mum
official
;
that
when
the
pain
of
existence
and
the
terror
of
dissolution
press
before
me
 
when
the
mighty
hope
and
measureless
doubt
of
the
future
arise
in
view
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
then
_
,
even
the
scientific
strain

or
the
prayer
in
a

learn
and
dead
<EOS>

harass
:
with
hindrance
a
heart
which
only
long
to
cry
 
<EOS>
"
God
be
merciful
to
me
,
a
sinner
!
"
  
<EOS>
when
I
have
so
speak
,
so
declare
my
faith
,
and
so
widely
sever
myself
,
<EOS>
from
him
I
address
 
then
,
at
last
,
come
a
tone
<EOS>
accordant
,
an
echo
responsive

one
sweet
chord

harmony

<EOS>
"
whatever

murmured
M.
Emanuel
,
"
<EOS>
God
be
good

all

<EOS>
believe
,
then
,
what
you
can
;
believe
it
as
you
can
;
one
prayer
,
at

,
we
have
in
common

I
also
cry
 
"
O

"
  
He
lean
on
the
back
of
my

<EOS>
after
some
think
he
again
speak
:
  
"
how
seem
in
the

whatever

here

yonder
 
<EOS>
how
seem
the

<EOS>
but
as
Time
be
not
for
God
,
nor
space

so
neither
be
measure
,
nor
comparison
.
<EOS>
We
abase
ourselves
in
our
littleness

and
we
do
right
;
yet
it
may
be
that
the
constancy
of
one
heart
,
the
truth
and
faith
of
one
mind
accord
to
the
light
He
have
appoint

import
as
much
to
Him
as
the
just
motion
of
satellite
about
their

of

well

their
intention
so
far
as
demonstrative
courtship
go
,
but
in
feel
they
soon
draw
very
near
.
  
<EOS>
all
that
be
good
in
Graham
seek
Paulina
;
whatever
in
him
be
noble
,
awoke
,
and
grow
in
her
presence
.
<EOS>
with
his
past
admiration
of
Miss
Fanshawe
,
I
suppose
his
intellect
have
little
to
do
,
but
his
whole
intellect
,
and
his
high
taste
,
come
in
question
now
.
<EOS>
these
,
like
all
his
faculty
,
be
active
,
eager
for
nutriment
,
and
alive
to
gratification
when
it
come
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
Paulina
designedly
lead
him
to
talk
of
book
,
or
formally
propose
to
herself
for
a
moment
the
task
of
win
him
to
reflection
,
or
plan
the
improvement
of
his
mind
,
or
so
much
as
fancy
his
mind
<EOS>
could
in
any
one
respect
be
improve
.
<EOS>
She
think
him
very
perfect
;
it
be
Graham
himself
,
who
,
at
first
by
the
mere
chance
,
mention
some
book
he
have
be
read
,
and
when
in
her
response
sound
a
welcome
harmony
of
sympathy
,
something
,
pleasant
to
his
soul
,
he
talk
on
,
more
and
well
perhaps
than
he
have
ever
talk
before
on
such
subject
.
<EOS>
She
listen
with
delight
,
and
answer
with
animation
.
<EOS>
in
each
successive
answer
,
Graham
hear
a
music
wax
fine
and
fine
to
his
sense
;
in
each
he
find
a
suggestive
,
persuasive
,
magic
accent
that
open
a
scarce
-
know
treasure
-
house
within
,
show
him
unsuspected
power
in
his
own
mind
,
and
what
be
well
,
latent
goodness
in
his
heart
.
<EOS>
each
like
the
way
in
which
the
other
talk
;
the
voice
,
the
diction
,
the
expression
please
;
each
keenly
relish
the
flavour
of
the
other
's
wit
;
they
meet
each
other
's
meaning
with
strange
quickness
,
their
thought
often
match
like
carefully
-
choose
pearl
.
<EOS>
Graham
have
wealth
of
mirth
by
nature
;
Paulina
possess
no
such
inherent
flow
of
animal
spirit
 
unstimulated
,
she
incline
to
be
thoughtful
and
pensive
 
<EOS>
but
now
she
seem
merry
as
a
lark
;
in
her
lover
's
genial
presence
,
she
glance
like
some
soft
glad
light
.
<EOS>
how
beautiful
she
grow
in
her
happiness
,
I
can
hardly
express
,
but
I
wonder
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
as
to
that
gentle
ice
of
her
 
that
reserve
on
which
she
have
depend
;
where
be
it
now
?
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
Graham
would
not
long
bear
it
;
he
bring
with
him
a
generous
influence
that
soon
thaw
the
timid
,
self
-
impose
restriction
.
  
<EOS>
now
be
the
old
Bretton
day
talk
over
;
perhaps
brokenly
at
first
,
with
a
sort
of
smile
diffidence
,
then
with
open
candour
and
still
grow
confidence
.
<EOS>
Graham
have
make
for
himself
a
well
opportunity
than
that
he
have
wish
me
to
give
;
he
have
earn
independence
of
the
collateral
help
that
disoblige
Lucy
have
refuse
;
all
his
reminiscence
of
"
little
Polly
"
find
their
proper
expression
in
his
own
pleasant
tone
,
by
his
own
kind
and
handsome
lip
;
how
much
well
than
if
suggest
by
me
.
  
<EOS>
More
than
once
when
we
be
alone
,
Paulina
would
tell
me
how
wonderful
and
curious
it
be
to
discover
the
richness
and
accuracy
of
his
memory
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
how
,
while
he
be
look
at
her
,
recollection
would
seem
to
be
suddenly
quicken
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
remind
her
that
she
have
once
gather
his
head
in
her
arm
,
caress
his
leonine
grace
,
and
cry
out
,
"
Graham
,
I
_
do
_
like
you
!
"
<EOS>
He
tell
her
how
she
would
set
a
footstool
beside
him
,
and
climb
by
its
aid
to
his
knee
.
<EOS>
at
this
day
he
say
he
could
recall
the
sensation
of
her
little
hand
smooth
his
cheek
,
or
bury
themselves
in
his
thick
mane
.
<EOS>
He
remember
the
touch
of
her
small
forefinger
,
place
half
tremblingly
,
half
curiously
,
in
the
cleft
in
his
chin
,
the
lisp
,
the
look
with
which
she
would
name
it
"
a
pretty
dimple
,
"
then
seek
his
eye
and
question
why
they
pierce
so
,
tell
him
he
have
a
"
nice
,
strange
face
;
far
nicer
,
far
strange
,
than
either
his
mamma
or
Lucy
Snowe

I
wonder
how
I
dare

venturous

<EOS>
to
me
he
seem
now
all
sacred
,
his

be
inaccessible
,
and
,
Lucy

I
feel
a
sort
of
fear

when
I
look
at

firm

marble
chin

at
his
straight
greek
feature

<EOS>

be

beautiful

Lucy

he
be
not
like
a

therefore
I
suppose
he
be
not
beautiful
,
but
what
be
he
,
then
?
<EOS>
do
other
people
see
him
with
my
eye
?
<EOS>
do
_
<EOS>
you
_
admire
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
I
do
,
Paulina
,
"
be
once
my
answer
to
her
many
question
.
"
<EOS>
_
I
never
see
him
_
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
him
twice
or
thrice
about
a
year
ago
,
before
he
recognise
me
,
and
then
I
shut
my
eye
;
and
if
he
be
to
cross
their
ball
twelve
time
between
each
day
's
sunset
and
sunrise
,
except
from
memory
,
I
should
hardly
know
what
shape
have
go
by

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
,
what
do
you
mean
?

say
she
,
under
her
breath
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
I
value
vision
,
and
dread

stone
blind

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
good
to
answer
her
strongly
at
once
,
and
to
silence
for
ever
the
tender
,
passionate
confidence
which
leave
her
lip
sweet
honey
,
and
sometimes
drop
in
my
ear
 
molten
lead
.
<EOS>
to
me
,
she
comment
no
more
on
her
lover
's
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
yet
speak
of
him
<EOS>
she
would
;
sometimes
shyly
,
in
quiet
,
brief
phrase
;
sometimes
with
a
tenderness
of
cadence
,
and
music
of
voice
exquisite
in
itself
;
but
which
chafe
me
at
time
miserably
;
and
then
,
I
know
,
I
give
her
stern
look
and
word
;
but
cloudless
happiness
have
dazzle
her
native
clear
sight
,
and
she
only
think
Lucy
 
fitful

<EOS>
"
spartan
girl
!
<EOS>
Proud
Lucy
!
<EOS>
"
she
would
say
,
smile
at
me
.
"
<EOS>
Graham
say
you
be
the
most
peculiar
,
capricious
little
woman
he
know

yet
you
be
excellent

we
both

so

<EOS>
"
You
both

have
the
goodness

little

I
shall
share
no

I

Lucy
,
I
wonder

ever
comprehend
you
altogether

"
  
<EOS>
there
be
,
in
lover
,
a
certain
infatuation
of
egotism
;
they
will
have
a
witness
of
their
happiness
,
cost
that
witness
what
it
may
.
<EOS>
Paulina
have
forbid
letter
,
yet
Dr.
Bretton
write
;
she
have
resolve
against
correspondence
,
yet
<EOS>
she
answer
,
be
it
only
to
chide
.
<EOS>
She
show
me
these
letter
;
with
something
of
the
spoiled
child
's
wilfulness
,
and
of
the
heiress
's
imperiousness
,
she
_
make
_
me
read
them
.
<EOS>
as
I
read
Graham
's
,
I
scarce
wonder
at
her
exaction
,
and
understand
her
pride
:
they
be
fine
letter
 
manly
and
fond
 
modest
and
gallant
.
<EOS>
her
must
have
appear
to
him
beautiful
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
be
write
to
show
her
talent
;
still
less
,
I
think
,
to
express
her
love
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
it
appear
that
she
have
propose
to
herself
the
task
of
hide
that
feeling
,
and
bridle
her
lover
's
ardour
.
<EOS>
but
how
could
such
letter
serve
such
a
purpose
?
<EOS>
Graham
be
become
dear
as
her
life
;
he
draw
her
like
a
powerful
magnet
.
<EOS>
for
her
there
be
influence
unspeakable
in
all
he
utter
,
write
,
think
,
or
look
.
<EOS>
with
this
unconfessed
confession
,
her
letter
glow
;
it
kindle
them
,
from
greet
to
adieu

<EOS>
"
I

be
her
anxious

I

yet
I

I
can
hardly
keep
Graham

him

<EOS>
there
be
nothing
I
long
for
more
than
to
have
this
affair
settle
 
to
speak
out
candidly
;
and
yet
I
dread
the
crisis
.
<EOS>
I
know
,
I
be
certain
,
papa
will
be
angry
at
the
first
;
I
fear
he
will
dislike
me
almost
;
it
will
seem
to
him
an
untoward
business
;
it
will
be
a
surprise
,
a
shock
:
I
can
hardly
foresee
its
whole
effect
on
him

"
  
<EOS>
the
fact
be
 
her
father
,
long
calm
,
be
begin
to
be
a
little
stirred
:
long
blind
on
one
point
,
an
importunate
light
be
begin
to
trespass
on
his
eye

<EOS>
to
_
her
_
,
he
say
nothing
;
but
when
she
be
not
look
at
,
or
perhaps
think
of
him
,
I
see
him
gaze
and
meditate
on
her
.
  
<EOS>
one
evening
 
Paulina
be
in
her
dressing
-
room
,
writing
,
I
believe
,
to
Graham
;
she
have
leave
me
in
the
library
,
read
 
M.
de
Bassompierre
come
in
;
he
sit
down
:
<EOS>
I
be
about
to
withdraw
;
he
request
me
to
remain
 
gently
,
yet
in
a
manner
which
show
he
wish
compliance
.
<EOS>
He
have
take
his
seat
near
the
window
,
at
a
distance
from
me
;
he
open
a
desk
;
he
take
from
it
what
look
like
a
memorandum
-
book
;
of
this
book
he
study
a
certain
entry
for
several
minute
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Snowe
,
"
say
he
,
lay
it
down
,
"
do
you
know
my
little
girl
's
age

"
<EOS>
about
eighteen

not

It
seem
so

me

on
the
5th
of
May
,
in
the
year
18
 
,
eighteen
year
ago

<EOS>
It
be
strange
;
I
have
lose
the
just
reckon
of
her
age
.
<EOS>
I
think
of
her
as
twelve
 
fourteen
 
an
indefinite
date
;

she
seem
a
child

<EOS>

She
be
about
eighteen

I
repeat

up

M.

in
a
tone

penetrate
like
some
of
his
daughter

accent

<EOS>
He
sit
very
thoughtful
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
do
not
grieve
,

I
say
;
for
I
know
his
feeling
,
utterly
unspoken
as
they
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
the
only
pearl
I
have

he
say
;
"
and
now
other
will
find
out
that
she
be
pure
and
of
price

they
will
covet
her

<EOS>
I
make
no
answer

<EOS>
Graham
Bretton
have
dine
with
us
that
day

he
have
shine
both
in
converse

his

under
the
stimulus

She

dismiss
this

suit

pretend

humour
me

you

it

papa

you
grasp

vice

<EOS>
You
crush
Graham
's
hand
to
the
bone
;
you
hurt
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
must
have
hurt
him
;
for
he
wear
a
massive
ring
,
set
round
with
brilliant
,
of
which
the
sharp
facet
cut
into
Graham
's
flesh
and
draw
blood
:
but
pain
only
make
Dr.
John
laugh

as
anxiety
have
make
him
smile

<EOS>
"
come
with
me

at
last
say
Mr.
Home
to
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
They
go
.
<EOS>
Their
intercourse
be
not
long
,
but
I
suppose
it
be
conclusive
.
<EOS>
the
suitor
have
to
undergo
an
interrogatory
and
a
scrutiny
on
many
thing
.
<EOS>
whether
Dr.
Bretton
be
at
time
guileful
in
look
and
language
or
not

there
be
a
sound
foundation
below

<EOS>
His
answer
,
I
understand
afterwards
,
evince
both
wisdom
and
integrity
.
<EOS>
He
have
manage
his
affair
well
.
<EOS>
He
have
struggle
through
entanglement
;
his
fortune
be
in
the
way
of
retrieval
;
he
prove
himself
in
a
position
to
marry

<EOS>
once
more

lover
appear

<EOS>
M.

shut
the
door

point
to
his

<EOS>
not
long
after
,
perhaps
a
fortnight
,
I
see
three
person
,
Count
de
Bassompierre
,
his
daughter
,
and
Dr.
Graham
Bretton
,
sit
on
one
seat
,
under
a
low
-
spread
and
umbrageous
tree
,
in
the
ground
of
the
palace
at
Bois
l'Etang
.
<EOS>
They
have
come
thith
to
enjoy
a
summer
evening
:
<EOS>
outside
the
magnificent
gate
their
carriage
wait
to
take
them
home
;
the
green
sweep
of
turf
spread
round
them
quiet
and
dim
;
the
palace
rise
at
a
distance
,
white
as
a
crag
on
Pentelicus
<EOS>
;
the
evening
star
shine
above
it
;
a
forest
of
flower
shrub
embalm
the
climate
of
this
spot
;
the
hour
be
still
and
sweet
;
the
scene
,
but
for
this
group
,
be
solitary
.
  
<EOS>
Paulina
sit
between
the
two
gentleman
:
while
they
converse
,
her
little
hand
be
busy
at
some
work
;
I
think
at
first
she
be
bind
a
nosegay
.
<EOS>
no
;
with
the
tiny
pair
of
scissor
,
glitter
in
her
lap
,
she
have
sever
spoil
from
each
manly
head
beside
her
,
and
be
now
occupy
in
plait
together
the
grey
lock
and
the
golden
wave
.
<EOS>
the
plait
weave
 
<EOS>
no
silk
-
thread
be
at
hand
to
bind
it
 
a
tress
of
her
own
hair
be
make
to
serve
that
purpose
;
she
tie
it
like
a
knot
,
prisone
it
in
a
locket
,
and
lay
it
on
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
"
say
she
,
"
there
be
an
amulet
make
,
which
have
virtue
to
keep
you
two
always
friend

<EOS>
You
can
never
quarrel
so
long
as
I
wear
this

"
  
<EOS>
an
amulet
be
indeed
make
,
a
spell
frame
which
render
enmity
impossible
.
<EOS>
She
be
become
a
bond
to
both
,
an
influence
over
each
,
a
mutual
concord
.
<EOS>
from
them
she
draw
her
happiness
,
and
what
she
borrow
,
she
,
with
interest
,
give
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
there
,
indeed
,
such
happiness
on
earth
?
"
<EOS>
I
ask
,
as
I
watch
the
father
,
the
daughter
,
the
future
husband
,
now
united
 
<EOS>
all
bless
and
blessing

<EOS>
yes
;
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
without
any
colouring
of
romance
,
or
any
exaggeration
of
fancy
,
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
some
real
life
do
 
for
some
certain
day
or
year
 
actually
anticipate
the
happiness
of
Heaven
;
and
,
I
believe
,
if
such
perfect
happiness
be
once
feel
by
good
people
(
to
the
wicked
it
never
come
)
,
its
sweet
effect
be
never
wholly
lose

<EOS>
whatever
trial
follow
,
whatever
pain
of
sickness
or
shade
of
death
,
the
glory
precedent
still
shine
through
,
cheer
the
keen
anguish
,
and
tinge
the
deep
cloud
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
go
farther
.
<EOS>
I
_
<EOS>
do
_
believe
there
be
some
human
being
so
bear
,
so
rear
,
so
guide
from
a
soft
cradle
to
a
calm
and
late
grave
,
that
no
excessive
suffering
penetrate
their
lot
,
and
no
tempestuous
blackness
overcast
their
journey
.
<EOS>
and
often
,
these
be
not
pamper
,
selfish
being
,
but
Nature
's
elect
,
harmonious
and
benign
;
man
and
woman
mild
with
charity
,
kind
agent
of
God
's
kind
attribute

<EOS>
let
me
not
delay
the
happy
truth
.
<EOS>
Graham
Bretton
and
Paulina
de
Bassompierre
be
married
,
and
such
an
agent
do
Dr.
Bretton
prove
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
with
time
degenerate
;
his
fault
decay
,
his
virtue
ripen
;
he
rise
in
intellectual
refinement
,
he
win
in
moral
profit
:
all
dreg
filter
away
,
the
clear
wine
settle
bright
and
tranquil

<EOS>
bright
,
too
,
be
the
destiny
of
his
sweet
wife
.
<EOS>
She
keep
her
husband
's
love
,
she
aid
in
his
progress
 
of
his
happiness
<EOS>
she
be
the
corner
stone
.
  
<EOS>
this
pair
be
bless
indeed
,
for

bring
them

great
prosperity

great
goodness

they
impart
with
open
hand
,
yet
wisely
.
<EOS>
doubtless
they
know
crosse
,
disappointment
,
difficulty
;
but
these
be
well
borne
.
<EOS>
more
than
once
,
too
,
they
have
to
look
on
Him
whose
face
flesh
scarce
can
see
and
live
:
they
have
to
pay
their
tribute
to
the
King
of
Terrors
.
<EOS>
in
the
fulness
of
year
,
M.
de
Bassompierre
be
take
:
in
ripe
old
age
depart
Louisa
Bretton
.
<EOS>
once
even
there
rise
a
cry
in
their
hall
,
of
Rachel
weep
for
her
child
;
but
other
spring
healthy
and
bloom
to
replace
the
lose
:
Dr.
Bretton
see
himself
live
again
in
a
son
who
inherit
his
look
and
his
disposition
;
he
have
stately
daughter
,
too
,
like
himself
:
these
child
he
rear
with
a
suave
,
yet
a
firm
hand
;
they
grow
up
accord
to
inheritance
and
nurture
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
do
but
speak
the
truth
when
I
say
that
these
two
life
of
Graham
and
Paulina
be
bless
,
like
that
of
Jacob

favoured
son
,
with
"
blessing
of
Heaven

blessing
of
the
deep

lie
under

It
be
so
,
for
God

it

<EOS>
but
it
be
not
so
for
all

<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
His
will
be
do
,
as
do
it
surely
will
be
,
whether
we
humble
ourselves
to
resignation
or
not

<EOS>
the
impulse
of
creation
forwards
it
;
the
strength
of
power
,
see
and
unseen
,
have
its
fulfilment
in
charge

<EOS>
proof
of
a
life
to
come
must
be
give

<EOS>
in
fire

in

,
if
needful

must
that

<EOS>
in

<EOS>
on
a
Thursday
morning
we
be
all
assemble
in
classe
,
wait
for
the
lesson
of
literature
.
<EOS>
the
hour
be
come
;
we
expect
the
master
.
  
<EOS>
the
pupil
of
the
first
classe
sit
very
still
;
the
cleanly
-
write
composition
prepare
since
the
last
lesson
lie
ready
before
them
,
neatly
tie
with
ribbon
,
wait
to
be
gather
by
the
hand
of
the
Professor
as
he
make
his
rapid
round
of
the
desk
.
<EOS>
the
month
be
July
,
the
morning
fine
,
the
glass
-
door
stand
ajar
,
through
it
play
a
fresh
breeze
,
and
plant
,
grow
at
the
lintel
,
wave
,
bent
,
look
in
,
seem
to
whisper
tiding
.
  
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
be
not
always
quite
punctual
;
we
scarcely
wonder
at
his
be
a
little
late
,
but
we
wonder
when
the
door
at
last
open
and
,
instead
of
him
with
his
swiftness
and
his
fire
,
there
come
quietly
upon
us
the
cautious
Madame
Beck
.
  
<EOS>
She
approach
M.
Paul
's
desk
;
she
stand
before
it
;
she
draw
round
her
the
light
shawl
cover
her
shoulder
;
begin
to
speak
in
low
,
yet
firm
tone
,
and
with
a
fix
gaze
,
she
say
,
"
this
morning
there
will
be
no
lesson
of
literature
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
second
paragraph
of
her
address
follow
,
after
about
two
minute
'
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
probable
the
lesson
will
be
suspend
for
a
week
.
<EOS>
I
shall
require
at
least
that
space
of
time
to
find
an
efficient
substitute
for
M.
Emanuel
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
it
shall
be
our
study
to
fill
the
blank
usefully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
professor
,
lady
,
"
she
go
on
,
"
intend
,
if
possible
,
duly
to
take
leave
of
you

<EOS>
at
the
present
moment
he
have
not
leisure
for
that
ceremony
.
<EOS>
He
be
prepare
for
a
long
voyage
.
<EOS>
a
very
sudden
and
urgent
summon
of
duty
call
him
to
a
great
distance
.
<EOS>
He
have
decide
to
leave
Europe
for
an
indefinite
time
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
may
tell
you
more
himself
.
<EOS>
lady
,
instead
of
the
usual
lesson
with
M.
Emanuel
,
you
will
,
this
morning
,
read
English
with
Mademoiselle
Lucy
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
bend
her
head
courteously
,
draw
closer
the
fold
of
her
shawl
,
and
pass
from
the
classe
.
  
<EOS>
a
great
silence
fall
:
then
a
murmur
go
round
the
room
:
I
believe
some
pupil
weep
.
  
<EOS>
some
time
elapse
.
<EOS>
the
noise
,
the
whispering
,
the
occasional
sobbing
increase
.
<EOS>
I
become
conscious
of
a
relaxation
of
discipline
,
a
sort
of
grow
disorder
,
as
if
my
girl
feel
that
vigilance
be
withdraw
,
and
that
surveillance
have
virtually
leave
the
classe
.
<EOS>
habit
and
the
sense
of
duty
enable
me
to
rally
quickly
,
to
rise
in
my
usual
way
,
to
speak
in
my
usual
tone
,
to
enjoin
,
and
finally
to
establish
quiet
.
<EOS>
I
make
the
English
reading
long
and
close
.
<EOS>
I
keep
them
at
it
the
whole
morning
.
<EOS>
I
remember
feel
a
sentiment
of
impatience
towards
the
pupil
who
sob
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
their
emotion
be
not
of
much
value
:
it
be
only
an
hysteric
agitation
.
<EOS>
I
tell
them
so
unsparingly
.
<EOS>
I
half
ridicule
them
.
<EOS>
I
be
severe
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
I
could
not
do
with
their
tear
,
or
that
gasping
sound
;
I
could
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
a
rather
weak
-
minded
,
low
-
spirited
pupil
keep
it
up
when
the
other
have
do
;
relentless
necessity
oblige
and
assist
me
so
to
accost
her
,
that
she
dare
not
carry
on
the
demonstration
,
that
she
be
force
to
conquer
the
convulsion
.
  
<EOS>
that
girl
would
have
have
a
right
to
hate
me
,
except
that
,
when
school
be
over
and
her
companion
depart
,
I
order
her
to
stay
,
and
when
they
be
go
,
I
do
what
I
have
never
do
to
one
among
them
before
 
press
her
to
my
heart
and
kiss
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
but
,
this
impulse
yield
to
,
I
speedily
put
her
out
of
the
classe
,
for
,
upon
that
poignant
strain
,
she
weep
more
bitterly
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
I
fill
with
occupation
every
minute
of
that
day
,
and
should
have
like
to
sit
up
all
night
if
I
may
have
keep
a
candle
burning
;
the
night
,
however
,
prove
a
bad
time
,
and
leave
bad
effect
,
prepare
me
ill
for
the
next
day
's
ordeal
of
insufferable
gossip
.
<EOS>
of
course
this
news
fall
under
general
discussion
.
<EOS>
some
little
reserve
have
accompany
the
first
surprise
:
that
soon
wear
off
;
every
mouth
open
;
every
tongue
wag
;
teacher
,
pupil
,
the
very
servant
,
mouth
the
name
of
"
Emanuel
.
"
<EOS>
He
,
whose
connection
with
the
school
be
contemporary
with
its
commencement
,
thus
suddenly
to
withdraw
!
<EOS>
all
feel
it
strange
.
  
<EOS>
They
talk
so
much
,
so
long
,
so
often
,
that
,
out
of
the
very
multitude
of
their
word
and
rumour
,
grow
at
last
some
intelligence
.
<EOS>
about
the
third
day
I
hear
it
say
that
he
be
to
sail
in
a
week
;
then
 
that
he
be
bind
for
the
West
Indies
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
Madame
Beck
's
face
,
and
into
her
eye
,
for
disproof
or
confirmation
of
this
report
;
I
peruse
her
all
over
for
information
,
but
no
part
of
her
disclose
more
than
what
be
unperturbed
and
commonplace
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
secession
be
an
immense
loss
to
her
,
"
she
allege
.
<EOS>
"
She
do
not
know
how
she
should
fill
up
the
vacancy
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
used
to
her
kinsman
,
he
have
become
her
right
hand
;
what
should
she
do
without
him
?
<EOS>
She
have
oppose
the
step
,
but
M.
Paul
have
convince
her
it
be
his
duty
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
say
all
this
in
public
,
in
classe
,
at
the
dinner
-
table
,
speak
audibly
to
Zélie
St.
Pierre
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
be
it
his
duty
?
<EOS>
"
I
could
have
ask
her
that
.
<EOS>
I
have
impulse
to
take
hold
of
her
suddenly
,
as
she
calmly
pass
me
in
classe
,
to
stretch
out
my
hand
and
grasp
her
fast
,
and
say
,
"
stop
.
<EOS>
let
us
hear
the
conclusion
of
the
whole
matter
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
why
_
be
it
his
duty
to
go
into
banishment
?
"
<EOS>
but
Madame
always
address
some
other
teacher
,
and
never
look
at
me
,
never
seem
conscious
I
could
have
a
care
in
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
the
week
wear
on
.
<EOS>
nothing
more
be
say
about
M.
Emanuel
come
to
bid
us
good
-
by
;
and
none
seem
anxious
for
his
coming
;
none
question
whether
or
not
he
would
come
;
none
betray
torment
lest
he
should
depart
silent
and
unseen
;
incessantly
do
they
talk
,
and
never
,
in
all
their
talk
,
touch
on
this
vital
point
.
<EOS>
as
to
Madame
,
she
of
course
could
see
him
,
and
say
to
him
as
much
as
she
please
.
<EOS>
what
should
_
<EOS>
she
<EOS>
_
care
whether
or
not
he
appear
in
the
schoolroom
?
  
<EOS>
the
week
consume
.
<EOS>
We
be
tell
that
he
be
go
on
such
a
day
,
that
his
destination
be
"
Basseterre
in
Guadaloupe
:
"
the
business
which
call
him
abroad
related
to
a
friend
's
interest
,
not
his
own
<EOS>
:
I
think
as
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
Basseterre
in
Guadaloupe
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
little
sleep
about
this
time
,
but
whenever
I
_
do
_
slumber
,
it
follow
infallibly
that
I
be
quickly
rouse
with
a
start
,
while
the
word
"
Basseterre
,
"
"
Guadaloupe
,
"
seem
pronounce
over
my
pillow
,
or
run
athwart
the
darkness
round
and
before
me
,
in
zigzag
character
of
red
or
violet
light
.
  
<EOS>
for
what
I
feel
there
be
no
help
,
and
how
could
I
help
feel
?
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
have
be
very
kind
to
me
of
late
day
;
he
have
be
grow
hourly
well
and
kind
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
a
month
since
we
have
settle
the
theological
difference
,
and
in
all
that
time
there
have
be
no
quarrel
.
<EOS>
nor
have
our
peace
be
the
cold
daughter
of
divorce
;
we
have
not
live
aloof
;
he
have
come
oftener
,
he
have
talk
with
me
more
than
before
;
he
have
spend
hour
with
me
,
with
temper
soothe
,
with
eye
content
,
with
manner
home
-
like
and
mild
.
<EOS>
kind
subject
of
conversation
have
grow
between
us
;
he
have
inquire
into
my
plan
of
life
,
and
I
have
communicate
them
;
the
school
project
please
him
;
he
make
me
repeat
it
more
than
once
,
though
he
call
it
an
Alnaschar
dream
.
<EOS>
the
jar
be
over
;
the
mutual
understanding
be
settle
and
fix
;
feeling
of
union
and
hope
make
themselves
profoundly
feel
in
the
heart
;
affection
and
deep
esteem
and
dawn
trust
have
each
fasten
its
bond
.
  
<EOS>
what
quiet
lesson
I
have
about
this
time
!
<EOS>
no
more
taunt
on
my
"
intellect
,
"
no
more
menace
of
grate
public
show
!
<EOS>
how
sweetly
,
for
the
jealous
gibe
,
and
the
more
jealous
,
half
-
passionate
eulogy
,
be
substitute
a
mute
,
indulgent
help
,
a
fond
guidance
,
and
a
tender
forbearance
which
forgave
but
never
praise
.
<EOS>
there
be
time
when
he
would
sit
for
many
minute
and
not
speak
at
all
;
and
when
dusk
or
duty
bring
separation
,
he
would
leave
with
word
like
these
,
"
<EOS>
il
est
doux
,
le
repos
!
<EOS>
il
est
précieux
le
calme
bonheur
!
"
  
<EOS>
one
evening
,
not
ten
short
day
since
,
he
join
me
whilst
walk
in
my
alley
.
<EOS>
He
take
my
hand
.
<EOS>
I
look
up
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
mean
to
arrest
my
attention
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bonne
petite
amie
<EOS>
!
"
say
he
,
softly
;
"
douce
consolatrice
!
"
<EOS>
but
through
his
touch
,
and
with
his
word
,
a
new
feeling
and
a
strange
thought
find
a
course
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
he
be
become
more
than
friend
or
brother
?
<EOS>
do
his
look
speak
a
kindness
beyond
fraternity
or
amity
?
  
<EOS>
His
eloquent
look
have
more
to
say
,
his
hand
draw
me
forward
,
his
interpreting
lip
stir
.
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
not
now
.
<EOS>
here
into
the
twilight
alley
break
an
interruption
:
it
come
dual
and
ominous
:
<EOS>
we
face
two
bodeful
form
 
a
woman
's
and
a
priest
's
 
Madame
Beck
and
Père
Silas
.
  
<EOS>
the
aspect
of
the
latter
I
shall
never
forget
.
<EOS>
on
the
first
impulse
it
express
a
Jean
-
Jacques
sensibility
,
stir
by
the
sign
of
affection
just
surprised
;
then
,
immediately
,
darken
over
it
the
jaundice
of
ecclesiastical
jealousy
.
<EOS>
He
speak
to
_
me
_
with
unction
.
<EOS>
He
look
on
his
pupil
with
sternness
.
<EOS>
as
to
Madame
Beck
,
she
,
of
course
,
see
nothing
 
nothing
;
though
her
kinsman
retain
in
her
presence
the
hand
of
the
heretic
foreigner
,
not
suffer
withdrawal
,
but
clasp
it
close
and
fast
.
  
<EOS>
follow
these
incident
,
that
sudden
announcement
of
departure
have
strike
me
at
first
as
incredible
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
only
frequent
repetition
,
and
the
credence
of
the
hundred
and
fifty
mind
round
me
,
which
force
on
me
its
full
acceptance
.
<EOS>
as
to
that
week
of
suspense
,
with
its
blank
,
yet
burn
day
,
which
bring
from
him
no
word
of
explanation
 
<EOS>
I
remember
,
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
describe
its
passage
.
  
<EOS>
the
last
day
break
.
<EOS>
now
would
he
visit
us
.
<EOS>
now
he
would
come
and
speak
his
farewell
,
or
he
would
vanish
mute
,
and
be
see
by
us
nevermore
.
  
<EOS>
this
alternative
seem
to
be
present
in
the
mind
of
not
a
live
creature
in
that
school
.
<EOS>
all
rise
at
the
usual
hour
;
all
breakfast
as
usual
;
all
,
without
reference
to
,
or
apparent
thought
of
their
late
Professor
,
betook
themselves
with
wonte
phlegm
to
their
ordinary
duty
.
  
<EOS>
so
oblivious
be
the
house
,
so
tame
<EOS>
,
so
train
its
proceeding
,
so
inexpectant
its
aspect
 
<EOS>
I
scarce
know
how
to
breathe
in
an
atmosphere
thus
stagnant
,
thus
smother
.
<EOS>
Would
no
one
lend
me
a
voice
?
<EOS>
have
no
one
a
wish
,
no
one
<EOS>
a
word
,
no
one
a
prayer
to
which
I
could
say
 
amen
?
  
<EOS>
I
have
see
them
unanimous
in
demand
for
the
mere
trifle
 
a
treat
,
a
holiday
,
a
lesson
's
remission
;
they
could
not
,
they
_
would
_
not
now
band
to
besiege
Madame
Beck
,
and
insist
on
a
last
interview
with
a
Master
who
have
certainly
be
love
,
at
least
by
some
 
love
as
_
<EOS>
they
_
could
love
 
<EOS>
but
,
oh
!
<EOS>
what
_
be
_
the
love
of
the
multitude
?
  
<EOS>
I
know
where
he
live
:
I
know
where
he
be
to
be
hear
of
,
or
communicate
with
;
the
distance
be
scarce
<EOS>
a
stone's
-
throw
:
<EOS>
have
it
be
in
the
next
room
 
<EOS>
unsummoned
,
I
could
make
no
use
of
my
knowledge
.
<EOS>
to
follow
,
to
seek
out
,
to
remind
,
to
recall
 
for
these
thing
I
have
no
faculty
.
  
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
may
have
pass
within
reach
of
my
arm
:
have
he
pass
silent
and
unnoticing
,
silent
and
stirless
<EOS>
should
I
have
suffer
him
to
go
by
.
  
<EOS>
morning
waste
.
<EOS>
Afternoon
come
,
and
I
think
all
be
over
.
<EOS>
My
heart
tremble
in
its
place
.
<EOS>
My
blood
be
trouble
in
its
current
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
sick
,
and
hardly
know
how
to
keep
at
my
post
 
or
do
my
work
.
<EOS>
yet
the
little
world
round
me
plod
on
indifferent
;
all
seem
jocund
,
free
of
care
,
or
fear
,
or
think
:
the
very
pupil
who
,
seven
day
since
,
have
weep
hysterically
at
a
startling
piece
of
news
,
appear
quite
to
have
forget
the
news
,
its
import
,
and
their
emotion
.
  
<EOS>
a
little
before
five
o'clock
,
the
hour
of
dismissal
,
Madame
Beck
send
for
me
to
her
chamber
,
to
read
over
and
translate
some
english
letter
she
have
receive
,
and
to
write
for
her
the
answer
.
<EOS>
before
settle
to
this
work
,
I
observe
that
she
softly
close
the
two
door
of
her
chamber
;
she
even
shut
and
fasten
the
casement
,
though
it
be
a
hot
day
,
and
free
circulation
of
air
be
usually
regard
by
her
as
indispensable
.
<EOS>
why
this
precaution
?
<EOS>
a
keen
suspicion
,
an
almost
fierce
distrust
,
suggest
such
question
.
<EOS>
do
she
want
to
exclude
sound
?
<EOS>
what
sound
?
  
<EOS>
I
listen
as
I
have
never
listen
before
;
I
listen
like
the
evening
and
winter
-
wolf
,
snuff
the
snow
,
scent
prey
,
and
hear
far
off
the
traveller
's
tramp
.
<EOS>
yet
I
could
both
listen
and
write
.
<EOS>
about
the
middle
of
the
letter
I
hear
 
what
check
my
pen
 
a
tread
in
the
vestibule
.
<EOS>
no
door
-
bell
have
ring
;
Rosine
 
<EOS>
act
doubtless
by
order
 
have
anticipate
such
réveillée
.
<EOS>
Madame
see
me
halt
.
<EOS>
She
cough
,
make
a
bustle
,
speak
louder
.
<EOS>
the
tread
have
pass
on
to
the
class
.
  
<EOS>
"
proceed
,
"
say
Madame
;
but
my
hand
be
fetter
,
my
ear
enchain
<EOS>
,
my
thought
be
carry
off
captive
.
  
<EOS>
the
class
form
another
building
;
the
hall
part
them
from
the
dwelling
-
house
:
despite
distance
and
partition
,
I
hear
the
sudden
stir
of
number
,
a
whole
division
rise
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
put
away
work
,
"
say
Madame
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
the
hour
to
put
away
work
,
but
why
that
sudden
hush
 
that
instant
quell
of
the
tumult
?
  
<EOS>
"
wait
,
Madame
 
<EOS>
I
will
see
what
it
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
I
put
down
my
pen
and
leave
her
.
<EOS>
leave
her
?
<EOS>
no
:
<EOS>
she
would
not
be
leave
:
powerless
to
detain
me
,
she
rise
and
follow
,
close
as
my
shadow
.
<EOS>
I
turn
on
the
last
step
of
the
stair
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
come
,
too
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
she
;
meet
my
glance
with
a
peculiar
aspect
 
a
look
,
clouded
,
yet
resolute
.
  
<EOS>
We
proceed
then
,
not
together
,
but
she
walk
in
my
step
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
come
.
<EOS>
enter
the
first
classe
,
I
see
him
.
<EOS>
there
,
once
more
appear
the
form
most
familiar
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
they
have
try
to
keep
him
away
,
but
he
be
come
.
  
<EOS>
the
girl
stand
in
a
semicircle
;
he
be
pass
round
,
give
his
farewell
,
press
each
hand
,
touch
with
his
lip
each
cheek
.
<EOS>
this
last
ceremony
,
foreign
custom
permit
at
such
a
parting
 
so
solemn
,
to
last
so
long
.
  
<EOS>
I
feel
it
hard
that
Madame
Beck
should
dog
me
thus
;
follow
and
watch
me
close
;
my
neck
and
shoulder
shrink
in
fever
under
her
breath
;
I
become
terribly
goaded
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
approach
;
the
semicircle
be
almost
travel
round
;
he
come
to
the
last
pupil
;
he
turn
.
<EOS>
but
Madame
be
before
me
;
she
have
step
out
suddenly
;
she
seem
to
magnify
her
proportion
and
amplify
her
drapery
;
she
eclipse
me
;
I
be
hide
.
<EOS>
She
know
my
weakness
and
deficiency
;
she
could
calculate
the
degree
of
moral
paralysis
 
the
total
default
of
self
-
assertion
 
with
which
,
in
a
crisis
,
I
could
be
strike
.
<EOS>
She
hasten
to
her
kinsman
,
she
break
upon
him
volubly
,
she
master
his
attention
,
she
hurry
him
to
the
door
 
the
glass
-
door
opening
on
the
garden
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
look
round
;
<EOS>
could
I
but
have
catch
his
eye
,
courage
,
I
think
,
would
have
rush
in
to
aid
feeling
,
and
there
would
have
be
a
charge
,
and
,
perhaps
,
a
rescue
;
but
already
the
room
be
all
confusion
,
the
semicircle
break
into
group
,
my
figure
be
lose
among
thirty
more
conspicuous
.
<EOS>
Madame
have
her
will
;
yes
,
she
get
him
away
,
and
he
have
not
see
me
;
he
think
me
absent
.
<EOS>
five
o'clock
strike
,
the
loud
dismissal
-
bell
rang
,
the
school
separate
,
the
room
empty
.
  
<EOS>
there
seem
,
to
my
memory
,
an
entire
darkness
and
distraction
in
some
certain
minute
I
then
pass
alone
 
a
grief
inexpressible
over
a
loss
unendurable
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
what
_
should
I
do
;
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
what
_
should
I
do
;
when
all
my
life
's
hope
be
thus
tear
by
the
root
out
of
my
riven
,
outrage
heart
?
  
<EOS>
what
I
_
should
_
have
do
,
I
know
not
,
when
a
little
child
 
the
least
child
in
the
school
 
break
with
its
simplicity
and
its
unconsciousness
into
the
raging
yet
silent
centre
of
that
inward
conflict
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
,
"
lisp
the
treble
voice
,
"
I
be
to
give
you
that
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
say
I
be
to
seek
you
all
over
the
house
,
from
the
grenier
to
the
cellar
,
and
when
I
find
you
,
to
give
you
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
the
child
deliver
a
note
;
the
little
dove
drop
on
my
knee
,
its
olive
leaf
pluck
off
.
<EOS>
I
find
neither
address
nor
name
,
only
these
word
:
    
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
my
intention
to
take
leave
of
you
when
I
say
good
-
by
to
the
rest
,
but
I
hope
to
see
you
in
classe
.
<EOS>
I
be
disappointed
.
<EOS>
the
interview
be
defer
.
<EOS>
be
ready
for
me
.
<EOS>
Ere
I
sail
,
I
must
see
you
at
leisure
,
and
speak
with
you
at
length
.
<EOS>
be
ready
;
my
moment
be
number
,
and
,
just
now
,
monopolize
;
besides
,
I
have
a
private
business
on
hand
which
I
will
not
share
with
any
,
nor
communicate
 
even
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
PAUL
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
ready
?
"
<EOS>
then
it
must
be
this
evening
:
<EOS>
be
he
not
to
go
on
the
morrow
?
<EOS>
yes
;
of
that
point
I
be
certain
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
the
date
of
his
vessel
's
departure
advertise
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
would
be
ready
,
but
could
that
long
-
for
meeting
really
be
achieve
?
<EOS>
the
time
be
so
short
,
the
schemer
seem
so
watchful
,
so
active
,
so
hostile
;
the
way
of
access
appear
strait
as
a
gully
,
deep
as
a
chasm
 
Apollyon
straddle
across
it
,
breathing
flame
.
<EOS>
Could
my
Greatheart
overcome
?
<EOS>
Could
my
guide
reach
me
?
  
<EOS>
who
may
tell
?
<EOS>
yet
I
begin
to
take
some
courage
,
some
comfort
;
it
seem
to
me
that
I
feel
a
pulse
of
his
heart
beat
yet
true
to
the
whole
throb
of
mine
.
  
<EOS>
I
wait
my
champion
.
<EOS>
Apollyon
come
trail
his
hell
behind
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
if
eternity
hold
torment
,
its
form
would
not
be
fiery
rack
,
nor
its
nature
despair
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
on
a
certain
day
amongst
those
day
which
never
dawn
,
and
will
not
set
,
an
angel
enter
Hades
 
stand
,
shone
,
smile
,
deliver
a
prophecy
of
conditional
pardon
,
kindle
a
doubtful
hope
of
bliss
to
come
,
not
now
,
but
at
a
day
and
hour
unlooke
for
,
reveal
in
his
own
glory
and
grandeur
the
height
and
compass
of
his
promise
:
speak
thus
 
then
tower
,
become
a
star
,
and
vanish
into
his
own
Heaven
.
<EOS>
His
legacy
be
suspense
 
a
bad
boon
than
despair
.
  
<EOS>
all
that
evening
I
wait
,
trust
in
the
dove
-
send
olive
-
leaf
,
yet
in
the
midst
of
my
trust
,
terribly
fear
.
<EOS>
My
fear
press
heavy
.
<EOS>
cold
and
peculiar
,
I
know
it
for
the
partner
of
a
rarely
-
belie
presentiment
.
<EOS>
the
first
hour
seem
long
and
slow
;
in
spirit
I
cling
to
the
fly
skirt
of
the
last
.
<EOS>
They
pass
like
drift
cloud
 
like
the
wrack
scud
before
a
storm
.
  
<EOS>
They
pass
.
<EOS>
all
the
long
,
hot
summer
day
burn
away
like
a
Yule
-
log
;
the
crimson
of
its
close
perish
;
I
be
leave
bent
among
the
cool
blue
shade
,
over
the
pale
and
ashen
gleam
of
its
night
.
  
<EOS>
prayer
be
over
;
it
be
bed
-
time
;
my
co
-
inmate
be
all
retire
.
<EOS>
I
still
remain
in
the
gloomy
first
classe
,
forgetting
,
or
at
least
disregarding
,
<EOS>
rule
<EOS>
I
have
never
forget
or
disregard
before
.
  
<EOS>
how
long
I
pace
that
classe
I
can
not
tell
;
I
must
have
be
afoot
many
hour
;
mechanically
have
I
move
aside
bench
and
desk
,
and
have
make
for
myself
a
path
down
its
length
.
<EOS>
there
I
walk
,
and
there
,
<EOS>
when
certain
that
the
whole
household
be
abed
,
and
quite
out
of
hearing
 
there
,
I
at
last
wept
.
<EOS>
reliant
on
Night
,
confide
in
Solitude
,
I
keep
my
tear
seal
<EOS>
,
my
sobs
chain
,
no
longer
;
they
heave
my
heart
;
they
tear
their
way
.
<EOS>
in
this
house
,
what
grief
could
be
sacred
?
  
<EOS>
soon
after
eleven
o'clock
 
a
very
late
hour
in
the
Rue
Fossette
 
<EOS>
the
door
unclosed
,
quietly
but
not
stealthily
;
a
lamp
's
flame
invade
the
moonlight
;
Madame
Beck
enter
,
with
the
same
compose
air
,
as
if
come
on
an
ordinary
occasion
,
at
an
ordinary
season
.
<EOS>
instead
of
at
once
address
me
,
she
go
to
her
desk
,
take
her
key
,
and
seem
to
seek
something
<EOS>
:
she
loiter
over
this
feign
search
long
,
too
long
.
<EOS>
She
be
calm
,
too
calm
;
my
mood
scarce
endure
the
pretence
;
drive
beyond
common
range
,
two
hour
since
I
have
leave
behind
me
wonte
respect
and
fear
.
<EOS>
lead
by
a
touch
,
and
rule
by
a
word
,
under
usual
circumstance
,
no
yoke
could
now
be
bear
 
no
curb
obey
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
more
than
time
for
retirement
,
"
say
Madame
;
"
the
rule
of
the
house
have
already
be
transgress
too
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Madame
meet
no
answer
:
<EOS>
I
do
not
check
my
walk
;
when
she
come
in
my
way
,
I
put
her
out
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
persuade
you
to
calm

Meess

let
me
lead
you
to
your
chamber

"
say
she
,
try
to
speak
softly
.
  
<EOS>
"
no

<EOS>
I
say
;
"
neither

Your

Goton

<EOS>
"
Madame

"
I
break
out

deep
into

in

heart

under

utterly
unknown

<EOS>
two
minute
I
stand
over
Madame

feel
that
the
whole
woman
be
in
my
power

because
in
some
mood
,
such
as
the

in
some
stimulate
state

like
that
of
this
instant
 
<EOS>
her
habitual
disguise
,
her
mask
and
her
domino
,
be
to
me
a
mere
network
reticulate
with
hole
;
and
I
see
underneath
a
be
heartless
,
self
-
indulgent
,
and
ignoble
.
<EOS>
She
quietly
retreat
from
me
:
meek

self

possess
,
though
very
uneasy
,
she
say
,
"

reluctantly

<EOS>
which
she
do
incontinent

perhaps
even
more
glad

get
away

than
I
be
to

her

<EOS>
this
be
the
sole
flash
-
eliciting
,
truth
-
extorting
,
rencontre
which
ever
occur
between
me

Madame

:
this
short
night
-
scene
be
never
repeat

<EOS>
It
do
not

whit
change
her
manner

me

<EOS>
I
do
not

she
revenge
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not

that
she
hate
me
the
bad
for
my
fell
candour

<EOS>
I
think
she
bucklere
herself
with
the
secret
philosophy
of
her
strong
mind
,
and
resolve
to
forget
what
it
irk
her
to
remember
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
to
the
end
of
our
mutual
life
there
occur
no
repetition
of
,
no
allusion

,
that
fiery
passage

<EOS>
that
night
pass
:
all
night
 
even
the
starless
night
before
dissolution
 
must
wear
away

<EOS>
about
six
o'clock
,
the
hour
which
call
up
the
household
,
I
go
out
to
the
court
,
and
wash
my
face
in
its
cold
,
fresh
well
-
water
.
<EOS>
enter
by
the
carré

a
piece
of
mirror

glass

set

repeat
my

<EOS>
It
say
I
be
change
:
my
cheek
and
lip
be
sodden
white
,
my
eye
be
glassy

and
my
eyelid
swollen

purple

<EOS>
on
rejoin
my
companion

I
know
they
all
look
at
me
 
<EOS>
my
heart
seem
discover
to
them
:
I
believe
myself
self
-
betray
.
<EOS>
hideously
certain
do
it
seem
that
the
very
young
of
the
school
must
guess
why
and
for
whom
I
despair

<EOS>
"
Isabelle

put
her
finger
in

and
stare
with
a
wistful
stupidity
which
at
the
moment
seem
to
me
more
beautiful
than
the
keen
intelligence

<EOS>
Isabelle
do
not
long
stand
alone
in
the
recommendation

ignorance

before
the
day
be
over

I
gather
cause
of
gratitude
towards
the
whole
blind
household

<EOS>
the
multitude
have
something
else
to

interpret
dark

<EOS>
who

may
keep
his

be
his

that
day

proof
meet
me
on
proof

not

that
the
cause

my
present
sorrow
be
unguessed

but
that
my
whole
inner
life
for
the
last
six
month

be
still
mine

<EOS>
It
be
not

<EOS>
Madame

read
the
riddle
:
none

resolve
it
.
<EOS>
what
I
now
suffer
be
call
illness
 
a
headache
:
I
accept
the
baptism
.
  
<EOS>
but
what
bodily
illness
be
ever
like
this
pain
?
<EOS>
this
certainty
that
he
be
go
without
a
farewell
 
this
cruel
conviction
that
fate
and
pursue
fury
 
a
woman
's
envy
and
a
priest
's
bigotry
 
would
suffer
me
to
see
him
no

<EOS>
what
wonder
that
the
second
evening
find
me
like
the
first
 
untame
,
torture
,
again
pace
a
solitary
room
in
an
unalterable
passion
of
silent
desolation
?
  
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
do
not
herself
summon
me
to
bed
that
night
 
she
do
not
come
near
me
:
she
send
Ginevra
Fanshawe
 
a
more
efficient
agent
for
the
purpose
she
could
not
have
employ
.
<EOS>
Ginevra
's
first
word
 
<EOS>
"
be
your
headache
very
bad
to

night
?
"
<EOS>
(
for
Ginevra
,
like
the
rest
,
think
I
have
a
headache
 
an
intolerable
headache
which
make
me
frightfully
white
in
the
face
,
and
insanely
restless
in
the
foot
)
 
<EOS>
her
first
word
,
I
say
,
inspire
the
impulse
to
flee
anywhere
,
so
that
it
be
only
out
of
reach
.
<EOS>
and
soon
,
what
follow
 
plaint
about
her
own
headache
 
complete
the
business
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
up
-
stair
.
<EOS>
presently
I
be
in
my
bed
 
<EOS>
my
miserable
bed
 
haunt
with
quick
scorpion
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
be
lay
down
five
minute
,
when
another
emissary
arrive
:
Goton
come
,
bring
me
something
to
drink
.
<EOS>
I
be
consume
with
thirst
 
<EOS>
I
drink
eagerly
;
the
beverage
be
sweet
,
but
I
taste
a
drug
.
  
<EOS>
"
Madame
say
it
will
make
you
sleep
,
chou
-
chou
,
"
say
Goton
,
as
she
receive
back
the
empty
cup
.
  
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
the
sedative
have
be
administer
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
they
have
give
me
a
strong
opiate
.
<EOS>
I
be
to
be
hold
quiet
for
one
night
.
  
<EOS>
the
household
come
to
bed
,
the
night
-
light
be
light
,
the
dormitory
hush
.
<EOS>
sleep
soon
reign
:
over
those
pillow
,
sleep
win
an
easy
supremacy
:
content
sovereign
over
head
and
heart
which
do
not
ache
 
<EOS>
he
pass
by
the
unquiet
.
  
<EOS>
the
drug
work
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
Madame
have
overcharge
or
under
-
charge
the
dose
;
its
result
be
not
that
she
intend
.
<EOS>
instead
of
stupor
,
come
excitement
.
<EOS>
I
become
alive
to
new
thought
 
to
reverie
peculiar
in
colour
.
<EOS>
a
gathering
call
run
among
the
faculty
,
their
bugle
sing
,
their
trumpet
ring
an
untimely
summon
.
<EOS>
imagination
be
rouse
from
her
rest
,
and
she
come
forth
impetuous
and
venturous
.
<EOS>
with
scorn
she
look
on
Matter
,
her
mate
 
"
rise
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
Sluggard
!
<EOS>
this
night
I
will
have
_
my
_
will
;
nor
shalt
thou
prevail
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
look
forth
and
view
the
night
!
"
<EOS>
be
her
cry
;
and
when
I
lift
the
heavy
blind
from
the
casement
close
at
hand
 
with
her
own
royal
gesture
,
she
show
me
a
moon
supreme
,
in
an
element
deep
and
splendid
.
  
<EOS>
to
my
gasping
sense
she
make
the
glimmering
gloom
,
the
narrow
limit
,
the
oppressive
heat
of
the
dormitory
,
intolerable
.
<EOS>
She
lure
me
to
leave
this
den
and
follow
her
forth
into
dew
,
coolness
,
and
glory
.
  
<EOS>
She
bring
upon
me
a
strange
vision
of
Villette
at
midnight
.
<EOS>
especially
she
show
the
park
,
the
summer
-
park
,
with
its
long
alley
all
silent
,
lone
and
safe
;
among
these
lie
a
huge
stone
basin
 
<EOS>
that
basin
I
know
,
and
beside
which
I
have
often
stand
 
deep
-
set
in
the
tree
-
shadow
,
brim
with
cool
water
,
clear
,
with
a
green
,
leafy
,
rushy
bed
.
<EOS>
what
of
all
this
?
<EOS>
the
park
-
gate
be
shut
up
,
lock
,
sentinelle
:
the
place
could
not
be
enter
.
  
<EOS>
Could
it
not
?
<EOS>
a
point
worth
considering
;
and
while
revolve
it
,
I
mechanically
dress
.
<EOS>
utterly
incapable
of
sleep
or
lie
still
 
excite
from
head
to
foot
 
<EOS>
what
could
I
do
better
than
dress
?
  
<EOS>
the
gate
be
lock
,
soldier
set
before
them
:
be
there
,
then
,
no
admission
to
the
park
?
  
<EOS>
the
other
day
,
in
walk
past
,
I
have
see
,
without
then
attend
to
the
circumstance
,
a
gap
in
the
paling
 
one
stake
break
down
:
<EOS>
I
now
see
this
gap
again
in
recollection
 
see
it
very
plainly
 
<EOS>
the
narrow
,
irregular
aperture
visible
between
the
stem
of
the
linden
,
plant
orderly
as
a
colonnade
.
<EOS>
a
man
could
not
have
make
his
way
through
that
aperture
,
nor
could
a
stout
woman
,
perhaps
not
Madame
Beck
;
but
I
think
I
may
:
<EOS>
I
fancy
I
should
like
to
try
,
and
once
within
,
at
this
hour
the
whole
park
would
be
mine
 
<EOS>
the
moonlight
,
midnight
park
!
  
<EOS>
how
soundly
the
dormitory
sleep
!
<EOS>
what
deep
slumber
!
<EOS>
what
quiet
breathing
!
<EOS>
how
very
still
the
whole
large
house
!
<EOS>
what
be
the
time
?
<EOS>
I
feel
restless
to
know
.
<EOS>
there
stand
a
clock
in
the
classe
below
:
<EOS>
what
hinder
me
from
venture
down
to
consult
it
?
<EOS>
by
such
a
moon
,
its
large
white
face
and
jet
black
figure
must
be
vividly
distinct
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
hindrance
to
this
step
,
there
offer
not
so
much
as
a
creaking
hinge
or
a
clicking
latch
.
<EOS>
on
these
hot
July
night
,
close
air
could
not
be
tolerate
,
and
the
chamber
-
door
stand
wide
open
.
<EOS>
Will
the
dormitory
-
plank
sustain
my
tread
untraitorous
?
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
I
know
wherever
a
board
be
loose
,
and
will
avoid
it
.
<EOS>
the
oak
staircase
creak
somewhat
as
I
descend
,
but
not
much
:
 
<EOS>
I
be
in
the
carré
.
  
<EOS>
the
great
classe
-
door
be
close
shut
:
they
be
bolt
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
the
entrance
to
the
corridor
stand
open
.
<EOS>
the
class
seem
to
my
thought
,
great
dreary
jail
,
bury
far
back
beyond
thoroughfare
,
and
for
me
,
fill
with
spectral
and
intolerable
Memories
,
lay
miserable
amongst
their
straw
and
their
manacle
.
<EOS>
the
corridor
offer
a
cheerful
vista
,
lead
to
the
high
vestibule
which
open
direct
upon
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
Hush
!
 
<EOS>
the
clock
strike
.
<EOS>
ghostly
deep
as
be
the
stillness
of
this
convent
,
it
be
only
eleven
.
<EOS>
while
my
ear
follow
to
silence
the
hum
of
the
last
stroke
,
I
catch
faintly
from
the
build
-
out
capital
,
a
sound
like
bell
or
like
a
band
 
a
sound
where
sweetness
,
where
victory
,
where
mourn
blend
.
<EOS>
oh
,
to
approach
this
music
nearer
,
to
listen
to
it
alone
by
the
rushy
basin
!
<EOS>
let
me
go
 
<EOS>
oh
,
let
me
go
!
<EOS>
what
hinder
,
what
do
not
aid
freedom
?
  
<EOS>
there
,
in
the
corridor
,
hang
my
garden
-
costume
,
my
large
hat
,
my
shawl
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
lock
on
the
huge
,
heavy
,
porte
-
cochère
;
there
be
no
key
to
seek
:
it
fasten
with
a
sort
of
spring
-
bolt
,
not
to
be
open
from
the
outside
,
but
which
,
from
within
,
may
be
noiselessly
withdraw
.
<EOS>
Can
I
manage
it
?
<EOS>
It
yield
to
my
hand
,
yield
with
propitious
facility
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
as
that
portal
seem
almost
spontaneously
to
unclose
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
as
I
cross
the
threshold
and
step
on
the
paved
street
,
wonder
at
the
strange
ease
with
which
this
prison
have
be
force
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
I
have
be
pioneer
invisibly
,
as
if
some
dissolve
force
have
go
before
me
:
for
myself
,
I
have
scarce
make
an
effort
.
  
<EOS>
Quiet
Rue
Fossette
!
<EOS>
I
find
on
this
pavement
that
wanderer
-
woo
summer
night
of
which
I
muse
<EOS>
;
I
see
its
moon
over
me
;
I
feel
its
dew
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
but
here
I
can
not
stay
;
I
be
still
too
near
old
haunt
:
so
close
under
the
dungeon
,
I
can
hear
the
prisoner
moan
.
<EOS>
this
solemn
peace
be
not
what
I
seek
,
it
be
not
what
I
can
bear
:
to
me
the
face
of
that
sky
bear
the
aspect
of
a
world
's
death
.
<EOS>
the
park
also
will
be
calm
 
<EOS>
I
know
,
a
mortal
serenity
prevail
everywhere
 
yet
let
me
seek
the
park
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
a
route
well
know
,
and
go
up
towards
the
palatial
and
royal
Haute
-
Ville
;
thence
the
music
I
have
hear
certainly
float
;
it
be
hush
now
,
but
it
may
re
-
waken
.
<EOS>
I
go
on
:
<EOS>
neither
band
nor
bell
music
come
to
meet
me
;
another
sound
replace
it
,
a
sound
like
a
strong
tide
,
a
great
flow
,
deepen
as
I
proceed
.
<EOS>
light
broke
,
movement
gather
,
<EOS>
chime
peal
 
to
what
be
I
come
?
<EOS>
enter
on
the
level
of
a
Grande
Place
,
I
find
myself
,
with
the
suddenness
of
magic
,
plunge
amidst
a
gay
,
living
,
joyous
crowd
.
  
<EOS>
Villette
be
one
blaze
,
one
broad
illumination
;
the
whole
world
seem
abroad
;
moonlight
and
heaven
be
banish
:
the
town
,
by
her
own
flambeaux
,
behold
her
own
splendour
 
<EOS>
gay
dress
,
grand
equipage
,
fine
horse
and
gallant
rider
throng
the
bright
street
.
<EOS>
I
see
even
score
of
mask
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
strange
scene
,
strange
than
dream
.
<EOS>
but
where
be
the
park
?
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
be
near
it
.
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
this
glare
the
park
must
be
shadowy
and
calm
 
_
there
_
,
at
least
,
be
neither
torch
,
lamp
,
nor
crowd
?
  
<EOS>
I
be
ask
this
question
when
an
open
carriage
pass
me
fill
with
know
face
.
<EOS>
through
the
deep
throng
it
could
pass
but
slowly
;
the
spirited
horse
fret
in
their
curbed
ardour
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
occupant
of
that
carriage
well
:
me
they
could
not
see
,
or
,
at
least
,
not
know
,
fold
close
in
my
large
shawl
,
screen
with
my
straw
hat
(
in
that
motley
crowd
no
dress
be
noticeably
strange
)
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
Count
de
Bassompierre
;
I
see
my
godmother
,
handsomely
apparelled
,
comely
and
cheerful
;
I
see
,
too
,
Paulina
Mary
,
compass
with
the
triple
halo
of
her
beauty
,
her
youth
,
and
her
happiness
.
<EOS>
in
look
on
her
countenance
of
joy
,
and
eye
of
festal
light
,
one
scarce
remember
to
note
the
gala
elegance
of
what
she
wear
;
I
know
only
that
the
drapery
float
about
her
be
all
white
and
light
and
bridal
;
seat
opposite
to
her
<EOS>
I
see
Graham
Bretton
;
it
be
in
look
up
at
him
<EOS>
her

have
catch
its
lustre
 
<EOS>
the
light
repeat
in
_

eye
beam
first
out

<EOS>
It
give
me
strange
pleasure
to
follow
these
friend
viewlessly
,
and
I
_
do
_
follow
them
,
as
I
think
,
to
the
park
.
<EOS>
I
watch
them
<EOS>
alight
(
carriage
be
inadmissible
)
amidst
new
and
unanticipated
splendour
.
<EOS>
Lo
!
<EOS>
the
iron
gateway
,
between
the
stone
column
,
be
span
by
a
flaming
arch
build
of
massed
star
;
and
,
follow
them
cautiously
beneath
that
arch
,
where
be
they
,
and
where
be
I
?
  
<EOS>
in
a
land
of
enchantment
,
a
garden
most
gorgeous
,
a
plain
sprinkle
with
coloured
meteor
,
a
forest
with
spark
of
purple
and
ruby
and
golden
fire
gem
the
foliage
;
a
region
,
not
of
tree
and
shadow
,
but
of
strange
architectural
wealth
 
of
altar
and
of
temple
,
of
pyramid
,
obelisk
,
and
sphinx
:
incredible
to
say
,
the
wonder
and
the
symbol
of
Egypt
teem
throughout
the
park
of
Villette
.
  
<EOS>
no

that
in
five
minute
the
secret
be
mine
 
the
key
of
the
mystery
pick
up
,
and
its
illusion
unveil
 
no

that
I
quickly
recognise
the
material
of
these
solemn
fragment
 
the
timber
,
the
paint

and
the
pasteboard
 
these
inevitable
discovery
fail
to
quite
destroy
the
charm
,
or
undermine
the
marvel
of
that
night
.
<EOS>
no
matter
that
I
now
seize
the
explanation
of
the
whole
great
fête
 
<EOS>
a
fête
of
which
the
conventual
Rue
Fossette
have
not

though
it

open
at

that
morning

near
midnight

<EOS>
in

an
awful

rumour
of

a
kind
of
struggle
in
the
street
 
<EOS>
a
bustle
 
<EOS>
a
running
to

some
rearing
of
barricade

some
burgher

rioting
,
<EOS>
some

much

solemnly

keep
as
a
festival
in
honour
of
the

patriot
and
martyr
of
somewhat
apocryphal
memory
 
<EOS>
the
morning

give
to
a
solemn
Te

in
St.
Jean
Baptiste
,
the
evening
devote
to
spectacle

decoration

and
illumination
,
such
as
these
I

<EOS>
while
look
up
at
the
image
of
a
white
ibis
,
fix
on
a
column
 
while
fathom
the
deep

torch

light
perspective
of
an
avenue
,
at
the
close
of
which

a

<EOS>
I
lose
sight
of
the
party
which
,
from
the
middle
of
the
great
square
,
I
have
follow
 
or
,
rather
,
they
vanish
like
a
group
of
apparition
.
<EOS>
on
this
whole
scene
be
impress
a
dream
-
like
character
:
every
shape
be
wavering
,
every
movement
float
,
every
voice
echo
-
like
 
half
-
mocking
,
half
-
uncertain
.
<EOS>
Paulina
and
her
friend
be
go
,
I
scarce
could
avouch
that
I
have
really
see
them
;
nor
do
I
miss
them
as
guide
through
the
chaos
,
far
less
regret
them
as
protector
amidst
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
that
festal
night
would
have
be
safe
for
a
very
child
.
<EOS>
half
the
peasantry
have
come
in
from
the
outlying
environ
of
Villette
,
and
the
decent
burgher
be
all
abroad
and
around
,
dress
in
their
good
.
<EOS>
My
straw
-
hat
pass
amidst
cap
and
jacket
,
short
petticoat
,
and
long
calico
mantle
,
without
,
perhaps
,
attract
a
glance
;
I
only
take
the
precaution
to
bind
down
the
broad
leaf
gipsy
-
wise
,
with
a
supplementary
ribbon
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
feel
safe
as
if
mask
.
  
<EOS>
Safe
I
pass
down
the
avenue
 
<EOS>
safe
I
mix
with
the
crowd
where
it
be
deep
.
<EOS>
to
be
still
be
not
in
my
power
,
nor
quietly
to
observe
.
<EOS>
I
take
a
revel
of
the
scene
;
I
drink
the
elastic
night
-
air
 
<EOS>
the
swell
of
sound
,
the
dubious
light
,
now
flash
,
now
fade
.
<EOS>
as
to
Happiness
or
Hope
,
they
and
I
have
shake
hand
,
but
just
now
 
I
scorn
despair
.
  
<EOS>
My
vague
aim
,
as
I
go
,
be
to
find
the
stone
-
basin
,
with
its
clear
depth
and
green
lining
:
of
that
coolness
and
verdure
<EOS>
I
think
,
with
the
passionate
thirst
of
unconscious
fever
.
<EOS>
amidst
the
glare
,
and
hurry
,
and
throng
,
and
noise
,
I
still
secretly
and
chiefly
long
to
come
on
that
circular
mirror
of
crystal
,
and
surprise
the
moon
glassing
therein
her
pearly
front
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
my
route
,
yet
it
seem
as
if
I
be
hinder
from
pursue
it
direct
:
now
a
sight
,
and
now
a
sound
,
call
me
aside
,
lure
me
down
this
alley
and
down
that
.
<EOS>
already
I
see
the
thick
-
plant
tree
which
frame
this
tremulous
and
rippled
glass
,
when
,
choir
out
of
a
glade
to
the
right
,
break
such
a
sound
as
I
think
may
be
hear
if
Heaven
be
to
open
 
such
a
sound
,
perhaps
,
as
_
be
_
hear
above
the
plain
of
Bethlehem
,
on
the
night
of
glad
tiding
.
  
<EOS>
the
song
,
the
sweet
music
,
rise
afar
,
but
rush
swiftly
on
fast
-
strengthen
pinion
 
there
sweep
through
these
shade
so
full
a
storm
of
harmony
that
,
have
no
tree
be
near
against
which
to
lean
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
must
have
drop
.
<EOS>
voice
be
there
,
it
seem
to
me
,
unnumbered
;
instrument
varied
and
countless
 
bugle
,
horn
,
and
trumpet
<EOS>
I
know
.
<EOS>
the
effect
be
as
a
sea
break
into
song
with
all
its
wave
.
  
<EOS>
the
swaying
tide
sweep
this
way
,
and
then
it
fall
back
,
and
I
follow
its
retreat
.
<EOS>
It
lead
me
towards
a
byzantine
building
 
a
sort
of
kiosk
near
the
park
's
centre
.
<EOS>
round
about
stand
crowded
thousand
,
gather
to
a
grand
concert
in
the
open
air
.
<EOS>
what
I
have
hear
be
,
I
think
,
a
wild
Jäger
chorus
;
the
night
,
the
space
,
the
scene
,
and
my
own
mood
,
have
but
enhance
the
sound
and
their
impression
.
  
<EOS>
here
be
assemble
lady
,
look
by
this
light
most
beautiful
:
some
of
their
dress
be
gauzy
,
and
some
have
the
sheen
of
satin
,
the
flower
and
the
blond
tremble
,
and
the
veil
wave
about
their
decorate
bonnet
,
as
that
host
-
like
chorus
,
with
its
greatly
-
gather
sound
,
sunder
the
air
above
them
.
<EOS>
Most
of
these
lady
occupy
the
little
light
park
-
chair
,
and
behind
and
beside
them
stand
guardian
gentleman
.
<EOS>
the
outer
rank
of
the
crowd
be
make
up
of
citizen
,
plebeian
and
police
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
outer
rank
I
take
my
place
.
<EOS>
I
rather
like
to
find
myself
the
silent
,
unknown
,
consequently
unaccosted
neighbour
of
the
short
petticoat
and
the
sabot
;
and
only
the
distant
gazer
at
the
silk
robe
,
the
velvet
mantle
,
and
the
plume
chapeau
.
<EOS>
amidst
so
much
life
and
joy
,
too
,
it
suit
me
to
be
alone
 
quite
alone
.
<EOS>
have
neither
wish
nor
power
to
force
my
way
through
a
mass
so
close
-
packed
,
my
station
be
on
the
farth
confine
,
where
,
indeed
,
I
may
hear
,
but
could
see
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
be
not
well
place
,
"
say
a
voice
at
my
elbow
.
<EOS>
who
dare
accost
<EOS>
_
me
_
,
a
being
in
a
mood
<EOS>
so
little
social
?
<EOS>
I
turn
,
rather
to
repel
than
to
reply
.
<EOS>
I
see
a
man
 
a
burgher
 
<EOS>
an
entire
stranger
,
as
I
deem
him
for
one
moment
,
but
the
next
,
recognise
in
him
a
certain
tradesman
 
<EOS>
a
bookseller
,
whose
shop
furnish
the
Rue
Fossette
with
its
book
and
stationery
;
a
man
notorious
in
our
pensionnat
for
the
excessive
brittleness
of
his
temper
,
and
frequent
snappishness
of
his
manner
,
even
to
us
,
his
principal
customer
:
but
whom
,
for
my
solitary
self
,
I
have
ever
be
dispose
to
like
,
and
have
always
find
civil
,
sometimes
kind
;
once
,
in
aid
me
about
some
troublesome
little
exchange
of
foreign
money
,
he
have
do
me
a
service
.
<EOS>
He
be
an
intelligent
man
;
under
his
asperity
,
he
be
a
good
-
hearted
man
;
the
thought
have
sometimes
cross
me
,
that
a
part
of
his
nature
bore
affinity
to
a
part
of
M.
Emanuel
's
(
whom
he
know
well
,
and
whom
I
have
often
see
sit
on
Miret
's
counter
,
turn
over
the
current
month
's
publication
)
;
and
it
be
in
this
affinity
I
read
the
explanation
of
that
conciliatory
feeling
with
which
I
instinctively
regard
him
.
  
<EOS>
strange
to
say
,
this
man
know
me
under
my
straw
-
hat
and
closely
-
fold
shawl
;
and
,
though
I
deprecate
the
effort
,
he
insist
on
make
a
way
for
me
through
the
crowd
,
and
find
me
a
well
situation
.
<EOS>
He
carry
his
disintereste
civility
further
;
and
,
from
some
quarter
,
procure
me
a
chair
.
<EOS>
once
and
again
,
I
have
find
that
the
most
cross
-
grained
be
by
no
means
the
bad
of
mankind
;
nor
the
humblest
in
station
,
the
least
polished
in
feeling
.
<EOS>
this
man
,
in
his
courtesy
,
seem
to
find
nothing
strange
in
my
being
here
alone
;
only
a
reason
for
extend
to
me
,
as
far
as
he
could
,
a
retiring
,
yet
efficient
attention
.
<EOS>
have
secure
me
a
place
and
a
seat
,
he
withdraw
without
ask
a
question
,
without
obtrude
a
remark
,
without
add
a
superfluous
word
.
<EOS>
no
wonder
that
Professor
Emanuel
like
to
take
his
cigar
and
his
lounge
,
and
to
read
his
feuilleton
in
M.
Miret
's
shop
 
the
two
must
have
suit
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
be
seat
five
minute
,
ere
<EOS>
I
become
aware
that
chance
and
my
worthy
burgher
friend
have
bring
me
once
more
within
view
of
a
familiar
and
domestic
group
.
<EOS>
right
before
me
sit
the
Brettons
and
de
Bassompierres
.
<EOS>
within
reach
of
my
hand
 
have
I
choose
to
extend
it
 
sit
a
figure
like
a
fairy
-
queen
,
whose
array
,
lily
and
their
leave
seem
to
have
suggest
;
<EOS>
whatever
be
not
spotless
white
,
be
forest
-
green
.
<EOS>
My
godmother
,
too
,
sit
so
near
,
that
,
have
I
lean
forward
,
my
breath
may
have
stir
the
ribbon
of
her
bonnet
.
<EOS>
They
be
too
near
;
have
be
just
recognise
by
a
comparative
stranger
,
I
feel
uneasy
at
this
close
vicinage
of
intimate
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
It
make
me
quite
start
when
Mrs.
Bretton
,
turn
to
Mr.
Home
,
and
speak
out
of
a
kind
impulse
of
memory
,
say
,
 
"
I
wonder
what
my
steady
little
Lucy
would
say
to
all
this
if
she
be
here
?
<EOS>
I
wish
we

bring
her
,
she
would
have
enjoy
it
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
she
would
,
so
she
would
,
in
her
grave
sensible
fashion
;
it
be
a
pity
<EOS>
but
we
have
ask
her
,
"
rejoin
the
kind
gentleman
;
and
add
,
"
I
like
to
see
her
so
quietly
pleased
;
so
little
moved
,
yet
so
content
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dear
be
they
both
to
me
,
dear
be
they
to
this
day
in
their
remember
benevolence
.
<EOS>
little
know
they
the
rack
of
pain
which
have
drive
Lucy
almost
into
fever
,
and
bring
her
out
,
guideless
and
reckless
,
urged
and
drug
to
the
brink
of
frenzy
.
<EOS>
I
have
half
a
mind
to
bend
over
the
elder
'
shoulder
,
and
answer
their
goodness
with
the
thank
of
my
eye
.
<EOS>
M.
de
Bassompierre
do
not
well
know
_
me
_
,
but
I
know
_
him
_
,
and
honour
and
admire
his
nature
,
with
all
its
plain
sincerity
,
its
warm
affection
,
and
unconscious
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
possibly
I
may
have
speak
,
but
just
then
Graham
turn
;
he
turn
with
one
of
his
stately
firm
movement
,
so
different
from
those
,
of
a
sharp
-
temper
under
-
sized
man
:
there
be
behind
him
a
throng
,
a
hundred
rank
deep
;
there
be
thousand
to
meet
his
eye
and
divide
its
scrutiny
 
why
then
do
he
concentrate
all
on
me
 
oppress
me
with
the
whole
force
of
that
full
,
blue
,
steadfast
orb
?
<EOS>
why
,
if
he
_
<EOS>
would
_
look
,
do
not
one
glance
satisfy
him
?
<EOS>
why
do
he
turn
on
his
chair
,
rest
his
elbow
on
its
back
,
and
study
me
leisurely
?
<EOS>
He
could
not
see
my
face
,
I
hold
it
down
;
surely
,
he
_
could
_
not
recognise
me
:
<EOS>
I
stoop
,
I
turn
,
I
_
would
_
not
be
know
.
<EOS>
He
rise
,
by
some
mean
he
contrive
to
approach
,
in
two
minute
he
would
have
have
my
secret
:
my
identity
would
have
be
grasp
between
his
,
never
tyrannous
,
but
always
powerful
hand
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
one
way
to
evade
or
to
check
him
.
<EOS>
I
imply
,
by
a
sort
of
supplicatory
gesture
,
that
it
be
my
prayer
to
be
let
alone
;
after
that
,
have
he
persist
,
he
would
perhaps
have
see
the
spectacle
of
Lucy
incense
:
not
all
that
be
grand
,
or
good
,
or
kind
in
him
(
and
Lucy
feel
the
full
amount
)
<EOS>
should
have
keep
her
quite
tame
,
or
absolutely
inoffensive
and
shadowlike
.
<EOS>
He
look
,
but
he
desist
.
<EOS>
He
shake
his
handsome
head
,
but
he
be
mute
.
<EOS>
He
resume
his
seat
,
nor
do
he
again
turn
or
disturb
me
by
a
glance
,
except
indeed
for
one
single
instant
,
when
a
look
,
rather
solicitous
than
curious
,
steal
my
way
 
speak
what
somehow
still
my
heart
like
"
the
south
-
wind
quiet
the
earth
.
<EOS>
"
Graham
's
thought
of
me
be
not
entirely
those
of
a
frozen
indifference
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
I
believe
in
that
goodly
mansion
,
his
heart
,
he
keep
one
little
place
under
the
sky
-
light
where
Lucy
may
have
entertainment
,
if
she
choose
to
call
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
so
handsome
as
the
chamber
where
he
lodge
his
male
friend
;
it
be
not
like
the
hall
where
he
accommodate
his
philanthropy
,
or
the
library
where
he
treasure
his
science
,
still
less
do
it
resemble
the
pavilion
where
his
marriage
feast
be
splendidly
spread
;
yet
,
gradually
,
by
long
and
equal
kindness
,
he
prove
to
me
that
he
keep
one
little
closet
,
over
the
door
of
which
be
write
"
Lucy
's
Room
.
<EOS>
"
I
keep
a
place
for
him
,
too
 
a
place
of
which
I
never
take
the
measure
,
either
by
rule
or
compass
:
I
think
it
be
like
the
tent
of
Peri
-
Banou
.
<EOS>
all
my
life
long
I
carry
it
fold
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand
yet
,
release
from
that
hold
and
constriction
<EOS>
,
I
know
not
but
its
innate
capacity
for
expanse
may
have
magnify
it
into
a
tabernacle
for
a
host
.
  
<EOS>
forbear
as
he
be
to
-
night
,
I
could
not
stay
in
this
proximity
;
this
dangerous
place
and
seat
must
be
give
up
:
I
watch
my
opportunity
,
rise
,
and
steal
away
.
<EOS>
He
may
think
,
he
may
even
believe
that
Lucy
be
contain
within
that
shawl
,
and
shelter
under
that
hat
;
he
never
could
be
certain
,
for
he
do
not
see
my
face
.
  
<EOS>
surely
the
spirit
of
restlessness
be
by
this
time
appease
?
<EOS>
have
I
not
have
enough
of
adventure
?
<EOS>
do
I
not
begin
to
flag
,
quail
,
and
wish
for
safety
under
a
roof
?
<EOS>
not
so
.
<EOS>
I
still
loathe
my
bed
in
the
school
dormitory
more
than
word
can
express
:
I
cling
to
whatever
could
distract
thought
.
<EOS>
somehow
I
feel
,
too
,
that
the
night
's
drama
be
but
begin
,
that
the
prologue
be
scarce
speak
:
throughout
this
woody
and
turfy
theatre
reign
a
shadow
of
mystery
;
actor
and
incident
unlooke
-
for
,
wait
behind
the
scene
:
I
think
so
foreboding
tell
me
as
much
.
  
<EOS>
stray
at
random
,
obey
the
push
of
every
chance
elbow
<EOS>
,
I
be
bring
to
a
quarter
where
tree
plant
in
cluster
,
or
tower
singly
,
break
up
somewhat
the
dense
packing
of
the
crowd
,
and
give
it
a
more
scatter
character
.
<EOS>
these
confine
be
far
from
the
music
,
and
somewhat
aloof
even
from
the
lamp
,
but
there
be
sound
enough
to
soothe
,
and
with
that
full
,
high
moon
,
lamp
be
scarce
need
.
<EOS>
here
have
chiefly
settle
family
-
group
,
burgher
-
parent
;
some
of
them
,
late
as
be
the
hour
,
actually
surround
by
their
child
,
with
whom
it
have
not
be
think
advisable
to
venture
into
the
close
throng
.
  
<EOS>
three
fine
tall
tree
grow
close
,
almost
twined
stem
within
stem
,
lift
a
thick
canopy
of
shade
above
a
green
knoll
,
crown
with
a
seat
 
a
seat
which
may
have
hold
several
,
yet
it
seem
abandon
to
one
,
the
remain
member
of
the
fortunate
party
in
possession
of
this
site
stand
dutifully
round
;
yet
,
amongst
this
reverend
circle
be
a
lady
,
hold
by
the
hand
a
little
girl
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
catch
sight
of
this
little
girl
,
she
be
twist
herself
round
on
her
heel
,
swinge
from
her
conductress
's
hand
,
fling
herself
from
side
to
side
with
wanton
and
fantastic
gyration
.
<EOS>
these
perverse
movement
arrest
my
attention
,
they
strike
me
as
of
a
character
fearfully
familiar
.
<EOS>
on
close
inspection
,
no
less
so
appear
the
child
's
equipment
;
the
lilac
silk
pelisse
,
the
small
swansdown
boa
,
the
white
bonnet
 
the
whole
holiday
toilette
,
in
short
,
be
the
gala
garb
of
a
cherub
but
too
well
known
,
of
that
tadpole
,
Désirée
Beck
 
and
<EOS>
Désirée
Beck
it
be
 
she
,
or
an
imp
in
her
likeness
.
  
<EOS>
I
may
have
take
this
discovery
as
a
thunder
-
clap
,
but
such
hyperbole
would
have
be
premature
;
discovery
be
destine
to
rise
more
than
one
degree
,
ere
it
reach
its
climax
.
  
<EOS>
on
whose
hand
could
the
amiable
Désirée
swing
thus
selfishly
,
whose
glove
could
she
tear
thus
recklessly
,
whose
arm
thus
strain
with
impunity
,
or
on
the
border
of
whose
dress
thus
turn
and
trample
insolently
,
if
not
the
hand
,
glove
,
arm
,
and
robe
of
her
lady
-
mother
?
<EOS>
and
there
,
in
an
indian
shawl
and
a
pale
-
green
crape
bonnet
 
there
,
fresh
,
portly
,
blithe
,
and
pleasant
 
there
stand
Madame
Beck
.
  
<EOS>
curious
!
<EOS>
I
have
certainly
deem
Madame
in
her
bed
,
and
Désirée
in
her
crib
,
at
this
bless
minute
,
sleep
,
both
of
them
,
the
sleep
of
the
just
,
within
the
sacred
wall
,
amidst
the
profound
seclusion
of
the
Rue
Fossette
.
<EOS>
most
certainly
also
they
do
not
picture
"
Meess
Lucie
"
otherwise
engage
;
and
here
we
all
three
be
take
our
"
ébat
"
in
the
fête
-
blaze
park
at
midnight
!
  
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
Madame
be
only
act
accord
to
her
quite
justifiable
will
not
.
<EOS>
I
remember
now
I
have
hear
it
say
among
the
teacher
 
though
without
at
the
time
particularly
notice
the
gossip
 
that
often
,
when
we
think
Madame
in
her
chamber
,
sleep
,
she
be
go
,
full
-
dressed
,
to
take
her
pleasure
at
opera
,
or
play
,
or
ball
.
<EOS>
Madame
have
no
sort
of
taste
for
a
monastic
life
,
and
take
care
 
largely
,
though
discreetly
 
to
season
her
existence
with
a
relish
of
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
half
a
dozen
gentleman
of
her
friend
stand
about
her
.
<EOS>
amongst
these
,
I
be
not
slow
to
recognise
two
or
three
.
<EOS>
there
be
her
brother
,
M.
Victor
Kint
;
there
be
another
person
,
moustache
and
with
long
hair
 
<EOS>
a
calm
,
taciturn
man
,
but
whose
trait
bear
a
stamp
and
a
semblance
I
could
not
mark
unmoved
.
<EOS>
amidst
reserve
and
phlegm
,
amidst
contrast
of
character
and
of
countenance
,
something
there
still
be
which
recall
a
face
 
mobile
,
fervent
,
feel
 
a
face
changeable
,
now
clouded
,
and
now
alight
 
a
face
from
my
world
take
away
,
for
my
eye
lose
,
but
where
my
good
spring
-
hour
of
life
have
alternate
in
shadow
and
in
glow
;
that
face
,
where
I
have
often
see
movement
so
near
the
sign
of
genius
 
that
why
there
do
not
shine
fully
out
the
undoubted
fire
,
the
thing
,
the
spirit
,
and
the
secret
itself
 
I
could
never
tell
.
<EOS>
yes
 
this
Josef
Emanuel
 
<EOS>
this
man
of
peace
 
remind
me
of
his
ardent
brother
.
  
<EOS>
besides
Messieurs
Victor
and
Josef
,
I
know
another
of
this
party
.
<EOS>
this
third
person
stand
behind
and
in
the
shade
,
his
attitude
too
be
stoop
,
yet
his
dress
and
bald
white
head
make
him
the
most
conspicuous
figure
of
the
group
.
<EOS>
He
be
an
ecclesiastic
:
he
be
Père
Silas
.
<EOS>
do
not
fancy
,
reader
,
that
there
be
any
inconsistency
in
the
priest
's
presence
at
this
fête
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
consider
a
show
of
Vanity
Fair
,
but
a
commemoration
of
patriotic
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
the
Church
patronise
it
,
even
with
ostentation
.
<EOS>
there
be
troop
of
priest
in
the
park
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
Père
Silas
stoop
over
the
seat
with
its
single
occupant
,
the
rustic
bench
and
that
which
sit
upon
it
:
a
strange
mass
<EOS>
it
be
 
bear
no
shape
,
yet
magnificent
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
indeed
,
the
outline
of
a
face
,
and
feature
,
but
these
be
so
cadaverous
and
so
strangely
place
,
you
could
almost
have
fancy
a
head
sever
from
its
trunk
,
and
fling
at
random
on
a
pile
of
rich
merchandise
.
<EOS>
the
distant
lamp
-
ray
glance
on
clear
pendant
,
on
broad
ring
;
neither
the
chasteness
of
moonlight
,
nor
the
distance
of
the
torch
,
could
quite
subdue
the
gorgeous
dye
of
the
drapery
.
<EOS>
Hail
,
Madame
Walravens
!
<EOS>
I
think
you
look
more
witch
-
like
than
ever
.
<EOS>
and
presently
the
good
lady
prove
that
she
be
indeed
no
corpse
or
ghost
,
but
a
harsh
and
hardy
old
woman
;
for
,
upon
some
aggravation
in
the
clamorous
petition
of
Désirée
Beck
to
her
mother
,
to
go
to
the
kiosk
and
take
sweetmeat
,
the
hunchback
suddenly
fetch
her
a
resounding
rap
with
her
gold
-
knob
cane
.
  
<EOS>
there
,
then
,
be
Madame
Walravens
,
Madame
Beck
,
Père
Silas
 
<EOS>
the
whole
conjuration
,
the
secret
junta
.
<EOS>
the
sight
of
them
thus
assemble
do
me
good
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
I
feel
weak
before
them
,
or
abash
,
or
dismay
.
<EOS>
They
outnumber
me
,
and
I
be
worst
and
under
their
foot
;
but
,
as
yet
,
<EOS>
I
be
not
dead
.
    
<EOS>
OLD
and
NEW
ACQUAINTANCE
.
  
<EOS>
fascinate
as
by
a
basilisk
with
three
head
,
I
could
not
leave
this
clique
;
the
ground
near
them
seem
to
hold
my
foot
.
<EOS>
the
canopy
of
entwined
tree
hold
out
shadow
,
the
night
whisper
a
pledge
of
protection
,
and
an
officious
lamp
flash
just
one
beam
to
show
me
an
obscure
,
safe
seat
,
and
then
vanish
.
<EOS>
let
me
now
briefly
tell
the
reader
all
that
,
during
the
past
dark
fortnight
,
I
have
be
silently
gather
from
Rumour
,
respect
the
origin
and
the
object
of
M.
Emanuel
's
departure
.
<EOS>
the
tale
be
short
,
and
not
new
:
its
alpha
be
Mammon
,
and
its
omega
Interest
.
  
<EOS>
if
Madame
Walravens
be
hideous
as
a
Hindoo
idol
,
she
seem
also
to
possess
,
in
the
estimation
of
these
her
votary
,
an
idol
's
consequence
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
she
have
be
rich
 
very
rich
;
and
though
,
for
the
present
,
without
the
command
of
money
,
she
be
likely
one
day
to
be
rich
again
.
<EOS>
at
Basseterre
,
in
Guadaloupe
,
she
possess
a
large
estate
,
receive
in
dowry
on
her
marriage
sixty
year
ago
,
sequester
since
her
husband
's
failure
;
but
now
,
it
be
suppose
,
clear
of
claim
,
and
,
if
duly
look
after
by
a
competent
agent
of
integrity
,
consider
capable
of
be
make
,
in
a
few
year
,
largely
productive
.
  
<EOS>
Père
Silas
take
an
interest
in
this
prospective
improvement
for
the
sake
of
religion
and
the
church
,
whereof
Magliore
Walravens
be
a
devout
daughter
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
,
distantly
relate
to
the
hunchback
and
know
her
to
be
without
family
of
her
own
,
have
long
brood
over
contingency
with
a
mother
's
calculate
forethought
,
and
,
harshly
treat
as
she
be
by
Madame
Walravens
,
never
cease
to
court
her
for
interest
's
sake
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
and
the
priest
be
thus
,
for
money
reason
,
equally
and
sincerely
interested
in
the
nursing
of
the
west
indian
estate
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
distance
be
great
,
and
the
climate
hazardous
.
<EOS>
the
competent

upright
agent
want

a
devoted
man

<EOS>
just
such
a
man
have
Madame
Walravens
retain
for
twenty
year
in
her
service
,
blight
his
life
,
and
then
live
on
him
,
like
an
old
fungus

such
a
man
have
Père
Silas
train
,
teach
,
and
bind
to
him
by
the
tie
of
gratitude
,
habit
,
and
belief

<EOS>
such
a
man
Madame
Beck
know

could
in
some
measure
influence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My

Père
Silas

if

<EOS>
Madame
Beck
make
also
her
private
comment
,
and
prefer
in
her
own
breast
her
secret
reason
for
desire
expatriation
.
<EOS>
the
thing
she
could
not
obtain
,
she
desire
not
another
to
win
:
rather
would
she
destroy
it
.
<EOS>
as
to
Madame
Walravens
,
she
want
her
money
and
her
land
,
and
know
Paul
,
if
he
like
,
could
make
the
good
and
faithfull
steward
:
so
the
three
self
-
seeker
band
and
beset
the
one
unselfish
.
<EOS>
They
reason
<EOS>
,
they
appeal
,
they
implore
;
on
his
mercy
they
cast
themselves
,
into
his
hand
they
confidingly
thrust
their
interest
.
<EOS>
They
ask
but
two
or
three
year
of
devotion
 
after
that
,
he
should
live
for
himself
:
one
of
the
number
<EOS>
,
perhaps
,
wish
that
in
the
meantime
he
may
die
.
  
<EOS>
no
live
be
ever
humbly
lay
his
advantage
at
M.
Emanuel

foot
,
or
confidingly
put
it
into
his
hand
,
that
he
spurn
the
trust
or
repulse
the
repository
.
<EOS>
what
may
be
his
private
pain
or
inward
reluctance
to
leave
Europe
 
what
his
calculation
for
his
own
future
 
none
ask
,
or
know
,
or
report
.
<EOS>
all
this
be
a
blank
to
me
.
<EOS>
His
conference
with
his
confessor
I
may
guess
;
the
part
duty
and
religion
be
make
to
play
in
the
persuasion
use
,
I
may
conjecture
.
<EOS>
He
be
go

and
have
make
no

<EOS>
there
my

close

<EOS>
with
my
head
bent
,
and
my
forehead
rest
on
my
hand
,
I
sit
amidst
group
tree
-
stem
and
branching
brushwood
.
<EOS>
whatever
talk
pass
amongst
my
neighbour
,
I
may
hear
,
if
I
would
;
I
be
near
enough
;
but
for
some
time
,
there
be
scarce
motive
to
attend
.
<EOS>
They
gossip
about
the
dress
,
the
music
,
the
illumination
,
the
fine
night
.
<EOS>
I
listen
to
hear
them
say
,
"
It
be
calm
weather
for
_
his
_
voyage
;
<EOS>
the
_
Antigua

(
his

"
<EOS>
no
such
remark
fall
;
neither
the
_
Antigua
_
,
nor
her
course
,
nor
her
passenger
be
name
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
the
light
chat
scarcely
interested
old
Madame
Walravens
more
than
it
do
me
;
she
appear
restless
,
turn
her
head
now
to
this
side
,
now
that
,
look
through
the
tree
,
and
among
the
crowd
,
as
if
expectant
of
an
arrival
and
impatient
of
delay
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
où

<EOS>
Pourquoi

<EOS>
"
I
hear
her
mutter
more
than
once
;
and
at
last
,
as
if
determine
to
have
an
answer
to
her
question
 
which
hitherto
none
seem
to
mind
,
she
speak
aloud
this
phrase
 
a
phrase
brief
enough
,
simple
enough
,
but
it
send
a
shock
through
me
 
"
Messieurs

she

"

why

Madame

<EOS>
You

go

<EOS>
thus
_
I
_
should
have
answer
,
have
the
response
lain
with
me
,
but
nobody
seem
to
be
of
my
mind
;
nobody
seem
surprised
,
startled
,
or
at
a
loss
.
<EOS>
the
quiet
commonplace
answer
meet
the
strange
,
the
dead
-
disturbing
,
the
witch
-
of

Endor
query
of
the
hunchback

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
out
of
this
question
and
reply
spring
a
change
in
the
chat
 
<EOS>
chat
it
still
remain
,
easy
,
desultory
,
familiar
gossip
.
<EOS>
Hint
,
allusion
,
comment

go
round
the
circle
,
but
all
so
broken
,
so
dependent
on
reference
to
person
not

or
circumstance
not

that
listen
as
intently
as
I
would
 
<EOS>
and
I
_
<EOS>
do
_
listen
_
now
_
with
a
fate
interest
 
<EOS>
I
could
make
out
no
more
than
that
some
scheme
be
on
foot
,
in
which
this
ghostly
Justine
Marie
 
dead
or
alive
 
be
concerned
.
<EOS>
this
family
-
junta
seem
grasp
at
her
somehow
,
for
some
reason
;
there
seem
question
of
a
marriage
,
of
a
fortune
 
for
whom
I
could
not
quite
make
out
-
perhaps
for
Victor
Kint
,
perhaps
for
Josef
Emanuel
 
both
be
bachelor
.
<EOS>
once
I
think
the
hint
and
jest
rain
upon
a
young
fair
-
haired
foreigner
of
the
party
,
whom
they
call
Heinrich
Mühler
.
<EOS>
amidst
all
the
badinage
,
Madame
Walravens
still
obtrude
from
time
to
time
,
hoarse
,
cross
-
grained
speech
;
her
impatience
be
divert
only
by
an
implacable
surveillance
of
Désirée
,
who
could
not
stir
but
the
old
woman
menace
her
with
her
staff
.
  
<EOS>
"
La

<EOS>
"
suddenly
cry
one
of
the
gentleman
,
"
voilà
Justine
Marie
qui
arrive

"
  
<EOS>
this
moment
be
for
me
peculiar
.
<EOS>
I
call
up
to
memory
the
picture
nun
on
the
panel
;
present
to
my
mind
be
the
sad
love
-
story
;
I
see
in
think
the
vision
of
the
garret
,
the
apparition
of
the
alley
,
the
strange
birth
of
the
berceau
;
I
undergo
a
presentiment
of
discovery
,
a
strong
conviction
of
come
disclosure
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
when
imagination
once
run
riot
where
do
we
stop
?
<EOS>
what
winter
tree
so
bare
and
branchless
 
what
way
-
side
,
hedge
-
munching
animal
so
humble
,
that
Fancy
,
a
pass
cloud
,
and
a
struggle
moonbeam
,
will
not
clothe
it
in
spirituality
,
and
make
of
it
a
phantom
?
  
<EOS>
with
solemn
force
press
on
my
heart
,
the
expectation
of
mystery
break
up
:
hitherto
I
have
see
this
spectre
only
through
a
glass
darkly
;
now
be
I
to
behold
it
face
to
face

<EOS>
I
lean
forward
;
I
look

<EOS>
"
She

<EOS>
cry
Josef
Emanuel
.
  
<EOS>
the
circle
open
as
if
open
to
admit
a
new
and
welcome
member
.
<EOS>
at
this
instant
a
torch
chance
to
be
carry
past
;
its
blaze
aid
the
pale
moon
in
do
justice
to
the
crisis
,
in
light
to
perfection
the
dénouement
press
on
.
<EOS>
surely
those
near
me
must
have
feel
some
little
of
the
anxiety
I
feel
,
in
degree
so
unmeted
.
<EOS>
of
that
group
the
coolest
must
have
"
hold
his

<EOS>
as
for
me

my

<EOS>
It
be
over

<EOS>
the
moment

the
nun

come

<EOS>
the
crisis

<EOS>
the
flambeau

what

<EOS>
how

<EOS>

<EOS>
there
be
many
mask

and
as
the

so
strange
a
feeling
of
revelry
and
mystery
begin
to
spread
abroad
,
that
scarce
would
you
discredit
me

be
I
to
say
that
she
be
like
the

that
she

white

that

the

and
that

ghost

<EOS>
all
falsity
 
all
figment
!
<EOS>
We
will
not
deal
in
this
gear

<EOS>
let
us
be
honest
,
and
cut
,
as
heretofore
,
from
the
homely
web
of
truth

<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Homely
_
,
though
,
be
an
ill
-
choose
word

<EOS>
what
I
see
be
not
precisely
homely
.
<EOS>
a
girl
of
Villette
stand
there
 
a
girl
fresh
from
her
pensionnat
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
comely
,
with
the
beauty
indigenous
to
this
country
.
<EOS>
She
look
well
-
nourished
,
fair
,
and
fat
of
flesh
.
<EOS>
Her
cheek
be
round
,
<EOS>
her
eye
good

her
hair
be
abundant

<EOS>
She
be
handsomely

<EOS>
She
be
not
alone

her

of
three

<EOS>
two

these
she
address
as
"
Mon
Oncle
"
and
"
Ma
Tante

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
laugh
,
she
chat
;
good
-
humoured
,
buxom
,
and
blooming
,
she
look
,
at
all
point
,
the
bourgeoise
belle
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
much
for
Justine
Marie
;
"
so
much
for
ghost
and
mystery
:
not
that
this
last
be
solve
 
<EOS>
this
girl
certainly
be
not
my
nun
:
<EOS>
what
I
see
in
the
garret
and
garden
must
have
be
tall
by
a
span
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
look
at
the
city
belle
;
we
have
cursorily
glance
at
the
respectable
old
uncle
and
aunt
.
<EOS>
have
we
a
stray
glance
to
give
to
the
third
member
of
this
company
?
<EOS>
Can
we
spare
him
a
moment
's
notice
?
<EOS>
We
ought
to
distinguish
him
so
far
,
reader
;
he
have
claim
on
us
;
we
do
not
now
meet
him
for
the
first

<EOS>
I
clasp
my
hand
very
hard
,
and
I
draw
my
breath
very
deep
<EOS>
:
I
hold
in
the
cry
,
I
devour
the
ejaculation
,
I
forbid
the
start
,
I
speak
and
I
stir
no
more
than
a
stone
;
but
I
know
what
I
look
on
;
through
the
dimness
leave
in
my
eye
by
many
night
'
weeping
,
I
know
him
.
<EOS>
They
say
he
be
to
sail
by
the
_
Antigua
_
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
say
so
.
<EOS>
She
lie
,
or
she
have
utter
what
be
once
truth
,
and
fail
to
contradict
it
when
it
become
false

<EOS>
the

Paul

a

<EOS>
be
it
a
fact

warrant
joy

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
ask
first
what
be
the
circumstance
attendant
on
this
respite

<EOS>
how
far
do
this
delay
concern

me
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
be
there
not
those
whom
it
may
touch
more
nearly
?
  
<EOS>
after
all
,
who
may
this
young
girl
,
this
Justine
Marie
,
be
?
<EOS>
not
a
stranger
,
reader
;
she
be
know
to
me
by
sight
;
she
visit
at
the
Rue
Fossette
:
<EOS>
she
be
often
of
Madame
Beck
's
Sunday
party
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
relation
of
both
the
Becks
and
Walravens
;
she
derive
her
baptismal
name
from
the
sainted
nun
who
would
have
be
her
aunt
have
she
live
;
her
patronymic
be
Sauveur
;
she
be
an
heiress
and
an
orphan
,
and
M.
Emanuel
be
her
guardian
;
some
say
her
godfather
.
  
<EOS>
the
family
junta
wish
this
heiress
to
be
married
to
one
of
their
band
 
which
be
it
?
<EOS>
vital
question
 
<EOS>
which
be
it
?
  
<EOS>
I
feel
very
glad
now
,
that
the
drug
administer
in
the
sweet
draught
have
fill
me
with
a
possession
which
make
bed
and
chamber
intolerable
.
<EOS>
I
always
,
through
my
whole
life
,
like
to
penetrate
to
the
real
truth
;
I
like
seek
the
goddess
in
her
temple
,
and
handle
the
veil
,
and
dare
the
dread
glance
.
<EOS>
o
titaness
among
deity
!
<EOS>
the
covered
outline
of
thine
aspect
sicken
often
through
its
uncertainty
,
but
define
to
us
one
trait
,
show
us
one
lineament
,
clear
in
awful
sincerity
;
we
may
gasp
in
untold
terror
,
but
with
that
gasp
we
drink
in
a
breath
of
thy
divinity
;
our
heart
shake
,
and
its
current
sway
like
river
lift
by
earthquake
,
but
we
have
swallow
strength
.
<EOS>
to
see
and
know
the
bad
be
to
take
from
fear
her
main
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
the
Walravens
'
party
,
augment
in
number
,
now
become
very
gay
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
fetch
refreshment
from
the
kiosk
,
all
sit
down
on
the
turf
under
the
tree
;
they
drink
health
and
sentiment
;
they
laugh
,
they
jest
.
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
undergo
some
raillery
,
half
good
-
humoured
,
half
,
I
think
,
malicious
,
especially
on
Madame
Beck
's
part
.
<EOS>
I
soon
gather
that
his
voyage
have
be
temporarily
defer
of
his
own
will
,
without
the
concurrence
,
even
against
the
advice
,
of
his
friend
;
he
have
let
the
_
Antigua
_
go
,
and
have
take
his
berth
in
the
_
Paul
et
Virginie
_
,
appoint
to
sail
a
fortnight
later
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
reason
for
this
resolve
which
they
tease
him
to
assign
,
and
which
he
would
only
vaguely
indicate
as
"
the
settlement
of
a
little
piece
of
business
which
he
have
set
his
heart
upon
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
_
be
_
<EOS>
this
business
?
<EOS>
nobody
know
.
<EOS>
yes
,
there
be
one
who
seem
partly
,
at
least
,
in
his
confidence
;
a
meaning
look
pass
between
him
and
Justine
Marie
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
La

enough

which
demonstration
,
I
see
the
light
-
complexioned
young
Teuton
,
Heinrich
Mühler
,
grow
restless
,
as
if
he
do
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
He
even
grumble
a
few
word
,
whereat
M.
Emanuel
actually
laugh
in
his
face
,
and
with
the
ruthless
triumph
of
the
assure
conqueror
,
he
draw
his
ward
nearer
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
be
indeed
very
joyous
that
night
.
<EOS>
He
seem
not
one
whit
subdue
by
the
change
of
scene
and
action
impend
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
true
life
of
the
party
;
a
little
despotic
,
perhaps
,
determine
to
be
chief
in
mirth
,
as
well
as
in
labour
,
yet
from
moment
to
moment
prove
indisputably
his
right
of
leadership
.
<EOS>
His
be
the
witty
word
,
the
pleasantest
anecdote
,
the
frank
laugh
.
<EOS>
restlessly
active
,
after
his
manner
,
he
multiply
himself
to
wait
on
all
;
but
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
see
which
be
his
favourite
.
<EOS>
I
see
at
whose
foot
he
lie
on
the
turf
<EOS>
,
I
see
whom
he
fold
carefully
from
the
night
air
,
whom
he
tend
,
watch
,
and
cherish
as
the
apple
of
his
eye

<EOS>
still
,
hint
and
raillery
fly
thick
,
and
still
I
gather
that
while
M.
Paul
should
be
absent
,
work
for
other
,
these
other
,
not
quite
ungrateful
,
would
guard
for
him
the
treasure
he
leave
in
Europe
.
<EOS>
let
him
bring
them
an
indian
fortune
:
they
would
give
him
in
return
a
young
bride
and
a
rich
inheritance
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
saintly
consecration
,
the
vow
of

the
blooming

charming
Present

over
the

and
,
at
length

his

be
indeed
bury

<EOS>
thus
it
must
be
.
<EOS>
the
revelation
be
indeed
come

<EOS>
presentiment
have
not
be
mistake
in
her
impulse
:
there
be
a
kind
of
presentiment
which
never

mistaken
;
it
be
I
who
have
for
a

miscalculate

not
see
the
true
bearing
of
the

I
have
think
she
mutter
of

when
,
in

,
her
prediction
touch
reality

<EOS>
I
may
have
pause
longer
upon
what
I
see
;
I
may
have
deliberate
ere
<EOS>
I
draw
inference
.
<EOS>
some
,
perhaps
,
would
have
hold
the
premise
doubtful
,
the
proofs
insufficient
;
some
slow
sceptic
would
have
incredulously
examine
ere
they
conclusively
accept
the
project
of
a
marriage
between
a
poor
and
unselfish
man
of
forty
,
and
his
wealthy
ward
of
eighteen
;
but
far
from
me
such
shift
and
palliative
,
far
from
me
such
temporary
evasion
of
the
actual
,
such
coward
flee
from
the
dread
,
the
swift
-
foot
,
the
all
-
overtake
fact
,
such
feeble
suspense
of
submission
to
her
the
sole
sovereign
,
such
paltering
and
falter
resistance
to
the
Power
whose
errand
be
to
march
conquering
and
to
conquer
,
such
traitor
defection
from
the
TRUTH
.
  
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
I
hasten
to
accept
the
whole
plan
.
<EOS>
I
extend
my
grasp
and
take
it
all
in
.
<EOS>
I
gather
it
to
me
with
a
sort
of
rage
of
haste
,
and
fold
it
round
me
,
as
the
soldier
strike
on
the
field
fold
his
colour
about
his
breast
.
<EOS>
I
invoke
Conviction
to
nail
upon
me
the
certainty

abhor
while
embrace

to
fix
it
with
the
strong
spike
her
strong
stroke
could
drive

when
the

enter

my

I
stand

even

still
flattering

it
waste
me

the

<EOS>
truth
strip
away
Falsehood

Flattery

Expectancy

and
here
I
stand
 
free

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
nothing
remain
now
but
to
take
my
freedom
to
my
chamber
,
to
carry
it
with
me
to
my
bed
and
see
what
I
could
make
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
play
be
not
yet
,
indeed
,
quite
play
out

<EOS>
I
may
have
wait
and
watch
longer
that
love

scene
under
the
tree
,
that
sylvan
courtship

<EOS>
have
there
be
nothing
of
love
in
the
demonstration
<EOS>
,
my
Fancy
in
this
hour
be
so
generous
,
so
creative
,
she
could
have
model
for
it
the
most
salient
lineament
,
and
give
it
the
deep
life
and
high
colour
of
passion
.
<EOS>
but
I
_
would
_
not
look
;
I
have
fix
my
resolve
,
but
I
would
not
violate
my
nature
.
<EOS>
and
then
 
something
tear
me
so
cruelly
under
my
shawl
,
something
so
dig
into
my
side
,
a
vulture
so
strong
in
beak
and
talon
,
I
must
be
alone
to
grapple
with
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
never
feel
jealousy
till
now
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
like
endure
the
endearment
of
Dr.
John

against
which
while
I
seal
my
eye

my
ear

while
I
withdraw
thence
<EOS>
my

my
sense

harmony
still
acknowledge
in

a

<EOS>
this
be
an
outrage

<EOS>
the
love
bear
of
beauty
be
not
mine
;
I
have
nothing
in
common
with
it
:
I
could
not
dare
to
meddle
with
it

but
another
love

venture
diffidently
into
life
after
long
acquaintance

furnace

try
by
pain

stamp
by
constancy
,
consolidate
by
affection
's
pure
and
durable
alloy
,
submit
by
intellect
to
intellect
's
own
test
,
and
finally
work
up
,
by
his
own
process
,
to
his
own
unflawed
completeness
,
this
love
that
laugh
at
passion
,
his
fast
frenzy
and
his
hot

hurried
extinction
,
in
_
<EOS>
this

Love
<EOS>
I
have
a
vested
interest

and
whatever
tend
either
to
its
culture

its
destruction
,
I
could
not
view
impassibly
.
  
<EOS>
I
turn
from
the
group
of
tree
and
the
"

in
its

.
<EOS>
midnight
be
long
past

the
concert
be
over
,
the

be
thin

<EOS>
I
follow
the

<EOS>
leave
the
radiant
park
and
well

Haute

Ville
(
still
well
lit
,
this
it
seem
be
to
be
a
"
nuit

"
in
Villette
)
,
I
seek
the
dim
low
quarter
.
  
<EOS>
Dim
I
should
not
say
,
for
the
beauty
of
moonlight
 
forget
in

here
once

high

out

shine
her
for
an

but
now

again
,
her

and
her

<EOS>
the
rival
lamp
be

she
hold
her
course
like
a
white
fate
.
<EOS>
drum
,
trumpet

bugle

have
utter
their

and
be

with

on

<EOS>
She
and
those

to
me
at

the
type
and
witness
of
truth
all
regnant
.
<EOS>
the

sky
light
her

like
its

advance
her
victory
 
<EOS>
that
onward
movement
which
have

and
will
be
from

to

<EOS>
these

be
very
still
:
I
like
them
for
their
lowliness

peace
.
<EOS>
homeward

pass
me
now
and
then

but
these

make

<EOS>
so
well
do
I
love
Villette
under

not
willingly
would
I
re

enter
under
a
roof

but
that
I
be
bent
on
pursue
my
strange
adventure
to
a
successful
close
,
and
quietly
regain
my
bed
in
the
great
dormitory
,
before
Madame
Beck
come
home
.
  
<EOS>
only
one
street
lie
between
me
and
the
Rue
Fossette
;
as
I
enter
it
,
for
the
first
time
,
the
sound
of
a
carriage
tear
up
the
deep
peace
of
this
quarter
.
<EOS>
It
come
this
way
 
<EOS>
come
very
fast
.
<EOS>
how
loud
sound
its
rattle
on
the
paved
path
!
<EOS>
the
street
be
narrow
,
and
I
keep
carefully
to
the
causeway
.
<EOS>
the
carriage
thunder
past
,
but
what
do
I
see
,
or
fancy
<EOS>
I
see
,
as
it
rush
by
?
<EOS>
surely
something
white
flutter
from
that
window
 
surely
a
hand
wave
a
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
be
that
signal
mean
for
me
?
<EOS>
be
I
known
?
<EOS>
who
could
recognise
me
?
<EOS>
that
be
not
M.
de
Bassompierre
's
carriage
,
nor
Mrs.
Bretton
's
;
and
besides
,
neither
the
Hôtel
Crécy
nor
the
château
of
La
Terrasse
lie
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
well
,
I
have
no
time
for
conjecture
;
I
must
hurry
home
.
  
<EOS>
gain
the
Rue
Fossette
,
reach
the
pensionnat
,
all
there
be
still
;
no
fiacre
have
yet
arrive
with
Madame
and
Désirée
.
<EOS>
I
have
leave
the
great
door
ajar
;
should
I
find
it
thus
?
<EOS>
perhaps
the
wind
or
some
other
accident
may
have
throw
it
to
with
sufficient
force
to
start
the
spring
-
bolt
?
<EOS>
in
that
case
,
hopeless
become
admission
;
my
adventure
must
issue
in
catastrophe
.
<EOS>
I
lightly
push
the
heavy
leaf
;
would
it
yield
?
  
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
as
soundless
,
as
unresisting
,
as
if
some
propitious
genius
have
wait
on
a
sesame
-
charm
,
in
the
vestibule
within
.
<EOS>
enter
with
bated
breath
,
quietly
make
all
fast
,
shoelessly
mount
the
staircase
,
I
seek
the
dormitory
,
and
reach
my
couch
.
     
<EOS>
ay
!
<EOS>
I
reach
it
,
and
once
more
draw
a
free
inspiration
.
<EOS>
the
next
moment
,
I
almost
shriek
 
almost
,
but
not
quite
,
thank
Heaven
!
  
<EOS>
throughout
the
dormitory
,
throughout
the
house
,
there
reign
at
this
hour
the
stillness
of
death
.
<EOS>
all
sleep
,
and
in
such
hush
,
it
seem
that
none
dream
.
<EOS>
stretch
on
the
nineteen

lie
nineteen
form
,
at
full

length

motionless

<EOS>
on
mine
 
the

couch
 
<EOS>
nothing
_
ought
_
to
have
lain
<EOS>
:
I
have
leave
it
void
,
and
void
should
have
find
it
.
<EOS>
what
,
then
;
do
I
see
between
the
half
-
draw
curtain
?
<EOS>
what
dark
,
usurping
shape
,
supine
,
long
,
and
strange
?
<EOS>
be
it
a
robber
who
have
make
his
way
through
the
open
street

door
,
and
lie
there
in
wait
?
<EOS>
It
look
very
black
,
I
think
it
look
 
not
human
.
<EOS>
Can
it
be
a
wander
dog
that
have
come
in
from
the
street
and
creep
and
nestled
hither
?
<EOS>
Will
it
spring

will

leap
out

I

<EOS>
Approach
I
must

<EOS>
courage

<EOS>
one

<EOS>
My

reel

for
by
the
faint

I
see
stretch
on
my

the

the

at
this

may
have
ruin

<EOS>
be
the
spectacle
what
it

I

neither

<EOS>
in
a
moment
,
without
exclamation
,
I
have
rush
on
the
haunt
couch
;
nothing
leap
out

or

all

fall
 
down

me
 
down
in
shred

I
trode
upon

morning
deck
her
beauty
with
ruby

and
so
fill
her
lap
with
rose

that
they
fall
from
her

<EOS>
the
Hours

fresh
as

empty
on

their

they

<EOS>
in
short
,
it
be
as
fine
a
day
as
the
fine
summer
could
boast
;
but
I
doubt
whether
I
be
not
the
sole
inhabitant
of
the
Rue
Fossette
,
who
care
or
remember
to
note
this
pleasant
fact

<EOS>
another
think
busy
all

;
a
thought
,
indeed
,
which
have
its
share
in
my
meditation
;
but
this
master
consideration
,
not
possess
for
me
so
entire
a
novelty
,
so
overwhelm
a
suddenness
,
especially
so
dense
a
mystery
,
as
it
offer
to
the

of
my

thereon
,
leave
me
somewhat
more
open
than
the
rest
to
any
collateral
observation
or
impression

<EOS>
still
,
while
walk
in
the
garden
,
feel
the
sunshine
,
and
mark
the
blooming
and
grow
plant
,
I
ponder
the
same
subject
the
whole
house
discuss
.
  
<EOS>
what
subject
?
  
<EOS>
merely
this
.
<EOS>
when
matin
come
to
be
say
,
there
be
a
place
vacant
in
the
first
rank
of
boarder
.
<EOS>
when
breakfast
be
serve
,
there
remain
a
coffee
-
cup
unclaimed
.
<EOS>
when
the
housemaid
make
the
bed
,
she
find
in
one
,
a
bolster
lay
lengthwise
,
clothe
in
a
cap
and
night

gown
;
and
when
Ginevra
Fanshawe
's
music
-
mistress
come
early
,
as
usual
,
to
give
the
morning
lesson
,
that
accomplish
and
promising
young
person
,
her
pupil
,
fail
utterly
to
be
forthcoming
.
  
<EOS>
high
and
low
be
<EOS>
Miss
Fanshawe
seek
;
through
length
and
breadth
be
the
house
ransack
;
vainly
;
not
a
trace
,
not
an
indication
,
<EOS>
not
so
much
as
a
scrap
of
a
billet
reward
the
search
;
the
nymph
be
vanish
,
engulf
in
the
past
night
,
like
a
shoot
star
swallow
up
by
darkness
.
  
<EOS>
Deep
be
the
dismay
of
surveillante
teacher
,
deep
the
horror
of
the
default
directress
.
<EOS>
never
have
I
see
Madame
Beck
so
pale
or
so
appalled
.
<EOS>
here
be
a
blow
strike
at
her
tender
part
,
her
weak
side
;
here
be
damage
do
to
her
interest
.
<EOS>
how
,
too
,
have
the
untoward
event
happen
?
<EOS>
by
what
outlet
have
the
fugitive
take
wing
?
<EOS>
not
a
casement
be
find
unfastened
,
not
a
pane
of
glass
break
;
all
the
door
be
bolt
secure
.
<EOS>
never
to
this
day
have
Madame
Beck
obtain
satisfaction
on
this
point
,
nor
indeed
have
anybody
else
concern
,
save
and
except
one
,
Lucy
Snowe
,
who
could
not
forget
how
,
to
facilitate
a
certain
enterprise
,
a
certain
great
door
have
be
draw
softly
to
its
lintel
,
close
,
indeed
,
but
neither
bolt
nor
secure
.
<EOS>
the
thundering
carriage
-
and
-
pair
encounter
be
now
likewise
recall
,
as
well
as
that
puzzle
signal
,
the
waved
handkerchief
.
  
<EOS>
from
these
premise
,
and
one
or
two
other
,
inaccessible
to
any
but
myself
,
I
could
draw
but
one
inference
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
case
of
elopement
.
<EOS>
morally
certain
on
this
head
,
and
see
Madame
Beck
's
profound
embarrassment
,
I
at
last
communicate
my
conviction
.
<EOS>
have
allude
to
M.
de
Hamal
's
suit
,
I
find
,
as
I
expect
,
that
Madame
Beck
be
perfectly
au
fait
to
that
affair
.
<EOS>
She
have
long
since
discuss
it
with
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
,
and
lay
her
own
responsibility
in
the
business
on
that
lady
's
shoulder
.
<EOS>
to
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
and
M.
de
Bassompierre
<EOS>
she
now
have
recourse
.
  
<EOS>
We
find
that
the
Hôtel
Crécy
be
already
alive
to
what
have
happen
.
<EOS>
Ginevra
have
write
to
her
cousin
Paulina
,
vaguely
signify
hymeneal
intention
;
communication
have
be
receive
from
the
family
of
de
Hamal
;
M.
de
Bassompierre
be
on
the
track
of
the
fugitive
.
<EOS>
He
overtake
them
too
late
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
the
week
,
the
post
bring
me
a
note
.
<EOS>
I
may
as
well
transcribe
it
;
it
contain
explanation
on
more
than
one
point
:
    
"
DEAR
OLD
TIM
"
(
short
for
Timon
)
,
 
"
<EOS>
I
be
off
<EOS>
you
see
 
go
like
a
shot
.
<EOS>
Alfred
and
I
intend
to
be
marry
in
this
way
almost
from
the
first
;
we
never
mean
to
be
splice
in
the
humdrum
way
of
other
people
;
Alfred
have
too
much
spirit
for
that
,
and
so
have
I
 
Dieu
merci
!
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
Alfred
,
who
use
to
call
you
"
the
dragon
,
"
have
see
so
much
of
you
during
the
last
few
month
,
that
he
begin
to
feel
quite
friendly
towards
you
.
<EOS>
He
hope
you
will
not
miss
him
now
that
he
have
go
;
he
beg
to
apologize
for
any
little
trouble
he
may
have
give
you
.
<EOS>
He
be
afraid
he
rather
inconvenience
you
once
when
he
come
upon
you
in
the
grenier
,
just
as
you
be
read
a
letter
seemingly
of
the
most
special
interest
;
but
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
give
you
a
start
,
you
appear
so
wonderfully
take
up
with
your
correspondent
.
<EOS>
en
revanche
,
he
say
you
once
frighten
him
by
rush
in
for
a
dress
or
a
shawl
,
or
some
other
chiffon
,
at
the
moment
when
he
have
strike
a
light
,
and
be
go
to
take
a
quiet
whiff
of
his
cigar
,
while
wait
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
begin
to
comprehend
by
this
time
that
M.
le
Comte
de
Hamal
be
the
nun
of
the
attic
,
and
that
he
come
to
see
your
humble
servant
?
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
how
he
manage
it
.
<EOS>
You
know
he
have
the
entrée
of
the
Athénée
,
where
two
or
three
of
his
nephews
,
the
son
of
his
eld
sister
,
Madame
de
Melcy
,
be
student
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
court
of
the
Athénée
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
high
wall
bound
your
walk
,
the
allée
défendue
.
<EOS>
Alfred
can
climb
as
well
as
he
can
dance
or
fence
:
his
amusement
be
to
make
the
escalade
of
our
pensionnat
by
mount
,
first
the
wall
;
then
 
by
the
aid
of
that
high
tree
overspread
the
grand
berceau
,
and
rest
some
of
its
bough
on
the
roof
of
the
low
building
of
our
premise
 
he
manage
to
scale
the
first
classe
and
the
grand
salle
.
<EOS>
one
night
,
by
the
way
,
he
fall
out
of
this
tree
,
tear
down
some
of
the
branch
,
nearly
break
his
own
neck
,
and
after
all
,
in
run
away
,
get
a
terrible
fright
,
and
be
nearly
catch
by
two
people
,
Madame
Beck
and
M.
Emanuel
,
he
think
,
walk
in
the
alley
.
<EOS>
from
the
grande
salle
the
ascent
be
not
difficult
to
the
high
block
of
building
,
finish
in
the
great
garret
.
<EOS>
the
skylight
,
you
know
,
be
,
day
and
night
,
leave
half
open
for
air
;
by
the
skylight
he
enter
.
<EOS>
nearly
a
year
ago
I
chance
to
tell
him
our
legend
of
the
nun
;
that
suggest
his
romantic
idea
of
the
spectral
disguise
,
which
I
think
you
must
allow
he
have
very
cleverly
carry
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
for
the
nun
's
black
gown
and
white
veil
,
he
would
have
be
catch
again
and
again
both
by
you
and
that
tiger
-
Jesuit
,
M.
Paul
.
<EOS>
He
think
you
both
capital
ghost
-
seer
,
and
very
brave
.
<EOS>
what
I
wonder
at
be
,
rather
your
secretiveness
than
your
courage
.
<EOS>
how
could
you
endure
the
visitation
of
that
long
spectre
,
time
after
time
,
without
cry
out
,
tell
everybody
,
and
rouse
the
whole
house
and
neighbourhood
?
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
and
how
do
you
like
the
nun
as
a
bed
-
fellow
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
dress
her
up
<EOS>
:
do
not
I
do
it
well
?
<EOS>
do
you
shriek
when
you
see
her
<EOS>
:
I
should
have
go
mad
;
but
then
you
have
such
nerve
!
 
<EOS>
real
iron
and
bend
-
leather
!
<EOS>
I
believe
you
feel
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
the
same
sensitiveness
that
a
person
of
my
constitution
have
.
<EOS>
You
seem
to
me
insensible
both
to
pain
and
fear
and
grief
.
<EOS>
You
be
a
real
old
diogene
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
dear
grandmother
!
<EOS>
and
be
you
not
mightily
angry
at
my
moonlight
flit
and
run
away
match
?
<EOS>
I
assure
you
it
be
excellent
fun
,
and
I
do
it
partly
to
spite
that
minx
,
Paulina
,
and
that
bear
,
Dr.
John
:
to
show
them
that
,
with
all
their
air
,
I
could
get
marry
as
well
as
they
.
<EOS>
M.
de
Bassompierre
be
at
first
in
a
strange
fume
with
Alfred
;
he
threaten
a
prosecution
for
"
détournement
de
mineur
,
"
and
I
know
not
what
;
he
be
so
abominably
in
earnest
,
that
I
find
myself
force
to
do
a
little
bit
of
the
melodramatic
 
go
down
on
my
knee
,
sob
,
cry
,
drench
three
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
"
mon
oncle
"
soon
give
in
;
indeed
,
where
be
the
use
of
make
a
fuss
?
<EOS>
I
be
married
,
and
that
be
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
He
still
say
our
marriage
be
not
legal
,
because
I
be
not
of
age
,
forsooth
!
<EOS>
as
if
that
make
any
difference
!
<EOS>
I
be
just
as
much
married
as
if
I
be
a
hundred
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
be
to
be
marry
again
,
and
I
be
to
have
a
trousseau
,
and
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
be
go
to
superintend
it
;
and
there
be
some
hope
that
M.
de
Bassompierre
will
give
me
a
decent
portion
,
which
will
be
very
convenient
,
as
dear
Alfred
have
nothing
but
his
nobility
,
native
and
hereditary
,
and
his
pay
.
<EOS>
I
only
wish
uncle
would
do
thing
unconditionally
,
in
a
generous
,
gentleman
-
like
fashion
;
he
be
so
disagreeable
as
to
make
the
dowry
depend
on
Alfred
's
give
his
write
promise
that
he
will
never
touch
card
or
dice
from
the
day
it
be
pay
down
.
<EOS>
They
accuse
my
angel
of
a
tendency
to
play
:
I
do
not
know
anything
about
that
,
but
I
_
do
<EOS>
_
know
he
be
a
dear
,
adorable
creature
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
sufficiently
extol
the
genius
with
which
de
Hamal
manage
our
flight
.
<EOS>
how
clever
in
him
to
select
the
night
of
the
fête
,
when
Madame
(
for
he
know
her
habit
)
,
as
he
say
,
would
infallibly
be
absent
at
the
concert
in
the
park
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
_
you
_
must
have
go
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
watch
you
rise
and
leave
the
dormitory
about
eleven
o'clock
.
<EOS>
how
you
return
alone
,
and
on
foot
,
I
can
not
conjecture

surely
be

and
proceed
literally
to
suffocate
me
with
her
unrestrained
spirit
,
her
girlish
,
giddy
,
wild
nonsense
.
<EOS>
She
show
her
ring
exultingly
;
she
call
herself
Madame
la
Comtesse
de
Hamal
,
and
ask
how
it
sound
,
a
score
of
time
.
<EOS>
I
say
very
little
.
<EOS>
I
give
her
only
the
crust
and
rind
of
my
nature
.
<EOS>
no
matter
she
expect
of
me
nothing
better
 
<EOS>
she
know
me
too
well
to
look
for
compliment
 
my
dry
gibe
please
her
well
enough
and
<EOS>
the
more
impassible
and
prosaic
my
mien
,
the
more
merrily
she
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
soon
after
his
marriage
,
M.
de
Hamal
be
persuade
to
leave
the
army
as
the
sure
way
of
wean
him
from
certain
unprofitable
associate
and
habit
;
a
post
of
attaché
be
procure
for
him
,
and
he
and
his
young
wife
go
abroad
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
would
forget
me
now
,
but
she
do
not
.
<EOS>
for
many
year
,
she
keep
up
a
capricious
,
fitful
sort
of
correspondence
.
<EOS>
during
the
first
year
or
two
,
it
be
only
of
herself
and
Alfred
<EOS>
she
write
;
then
,
Alfred
fade
in
the
background
;
herself
and
a
certain
,
new
comer
prevail
;
one
Alfred
Fanshawe
de
Bassompierre
de
Hamal
begin
to
reign
in
his
father
's
stead
.
<EOS>
there
be
great
boasting
about
this
personage
,
extravagant
amplification
upon
miracle
of
precocity
,
mix
with
vehement
objurgation
against
the
phlegmatic
incredulity
with
which
I
receive
them
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
"
what
it
be
to
be
a
mother
;
"
"
unfeeling
thing
that
I
be
,
the
sensibility
of
the
maternal
heart
be
Greek
and
Hebrew
to
me
,
"
and
so
on
.
<EOS>
in
due
course
of
nature
this
young
gentleman
take
his
degree
in
teething
,
measle
,
<EOS>
hooping
-
cough
<EOS>
:
that
be
a
terrible
time
for
me
 
<EOS>
the
mamma
's
letter
become
a
perfect
shout
of
affliction
;
never
woman
be
so
put
upon
by
calamity
:
never
human
being
stand
in
such
need
of
sympathy
.
<EOS>
I
be
frighten
at
first
,
and
write
back
pathetically
;
but
I
soon
find
out
there
be
more
cry
than
wool
in
the
business
,
and
relapse
into
my
natural
cruel
insensibility
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
youthful
sufferer
,
he
weather
each
storm
like
a
hero
.
<EOS>
five
time
be
that
youth
"
in
articulo
mortis
,
"
and
five
time
do
he
miraculously
revive
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
year
there
arise
ominous
murmuring
against
Alfred
the
first
;
M.
de
Bassompierre
have
to
be
appeal
to
,
debt
have
to
be
pay
,
some
of
them
of
that
dismal
and
dingy
order
call
"
debt
of
honour
;
"
ignoble
plaint
and
difficulty
become
frequent
.
<EOS>
under
every
cloud
,
no
matter
what
its
nature
,
Ginevra
,
as
of
old
,
call
out
lustily
for
sympathy
and
aid
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
notion
of
meet
any
distress
single

handed

<EOS>
in
some
shape
,
from
some
quarter
or
other

she
be
pretty
sure
to
obtain
her
will
,
and
so
she
get
on
 
fight
the
battle
of
life
by
proxy
,
and
,
on
the
whole
,
suffer
as
little
as
any
human

<EOS>
I
have
ever
know

<EOS>
FAUBOURG

<EOS>
Must
I
,
ere
I
close
,
render
some
account
of
that
Freedom
and
Renovation
which
I
win
on
the
fête
-
night
?
<EOS>
Must
I
tell
how
I
and
the
two
stalwart
companion
<EOS>
I
bring
home
from
the
illuminate
park
bear
the
test
of
intimate
acquaintance
?
  
<EOS>
I
try
them
the
very
next
day
.
<EOS>
They
have
boast
their
strength
loudly
when
they
reclaim
me
from
love
and
its
bondage
,
but
upon
my
demand
deed
,
not
word
,
some
evidence
of
well
comfort
,
some
experience
of
a
relieved
life
 
freedom
excuse
himself
,
as
for
the
present
impoverished
and
disabled
to
assist
;
and
Renovation
never
speak
;
he
have
die
in
the
night
suddenly
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
leave
for
it
then
but
to
trust
secretly
that
conjecture
may
have
hurry
me
too
fast
and
too
far
,
to
sustain
the
oppressive
hour
by
reminder
of
the
distorting
and
discolour
magic
of
jealousy
.
<EOS>
after
a
short
and
vain
struggle
,
I
find
myself
bring
back
captive
to
the
old
rack
of
suspense
,
tie
down
and
strain
anew
.
  
<EOS>
Shall
I
yet
see
him
before
he
go
?
<EOS>
Will
he
bear
me
in
mind
?
<EOS>
do
he
purpose
to
come
?
<EOS>
Will
this
day
 
will
the
next
hour
bring
him
?
<EOS>
or
must
I
again
assay
that
corrode
pain
of
long
attent
 
that
rude
agony
of
rupture
at
the
close
,
that
mute
,
mortal
wrench
,
which
,
in
at
once
uproot
hope
and
doubt
,
shake
life
;
while
the
hand
that
do
the
violence
can
not
be
caress
to
pity
,
because
absence
interpose
her
barrier
!
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
Feast
of
the
assumption
;
no
school
be
hold
.
<EOS>
the
boarder
and
teacher
,
after
attend
mass
in
the
morning
,
be
go
a
long
walk
into
the
country
to
take
their
goûter
,
or
afternoon
meal
,
at
some
farm
-
house
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
go
with
them
,
for
now
but
two
day
remain
ere
the
_
Paul
et
<EOS>
Virginie
_
must
sail
,
and
I
be
cling
to
my
last
chance
,
as
the
live
waif
of
a
wreck
cling
to
his
last
raft
or
cable
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
some
joiner
'
work
to
do
in
the
first
classe
,
some
bench
or
desk
to
repair
;
holiday
be
often
turn
to
account
for
the
performance
of
these
operation
,
which
could
not
be
execute
when
the
room
be
fill
with
pupil
.
<EOS>
as
I
sit
solitary
,
purpose
to
adjourn
to
the
garden
and
leave
the
coast
clear
,
but
too
listless
to
fulfil
my
own
intent
,
I
hear
the
workman
come
.
  
<EOS>
foreign
artisan
and
servant
do
everything
by
couple
:
I
believe
it
would
take
two
Labassecourien
carpenter
to
drive
a
nail
.
<EOS>
while
tie
on
my
bonnet
,
which
have
hitherto
hang
by
its
ribbon
from
my
idle
hand
,
I
vaguely
and
momentarily
wonder
to
hear
the
step
of
but
one
"
ouvrier
.
<EOS>
"
I
note
,
too
 
as
captive
in
dungeon
find
sometimes
dreary
leisure
to
note
the
mere
trifle
 
that
this
man
wear
shoe
,
and
not
sabot
:
<EOS>
I
conclude
that
it
must
be
the
master
-
carpenter
,
come
to
inspect
before
he
send
his
journeyman
.
<EOS>
I
throw
round
me
my
scarf
.
<EOS>
He
advance
;
he
open
the
door
;
my
back
be
towards
it
;
I
feel
a
little
thrill
 
<EOS>
a
curious
sensation
,
too
quick
and
transient
to
be
analyze
.
<EOS>
I
turn
,
I
stand
in
the
suppose
master
-
artisan
's
presence
:
<EOS>
look
towards
the
door
-
way
,
I
see
it
fill
with
a
figure
,
and
my
eye
print
upon
my
brain
the
picture
of
M.
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
hundred
of
the
prayer
with
which
we
weary
Heaven
bring
to
the
suppliant
no
fulfilment
.
<EOS>
once
haply
in
life
,
one
golden
gift
fall
prone
in
the
lap
 
<EOS>
one
boon
full
and
bright
,
perfect
from
Fruition
's
mint
.
  
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
wear
the
dress
in
which
he
probably
purpose
to
travel
 
a
surtout
,
guard
with
velvet
;
I
think
him
prepare
for
instant
departure
,
and
yet
I
have
understand
that
two
day
be
yet
to
run
before
the
ship
sail
.
<EOS>
He
look
well
and
cheerful
.
<EOS>
He
look
kind
and
benign
:
he
come
in
with
eagerness
;
he
be
close
to
me
in
one
second
;
he
be
all
amity
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
his
bridegroom
mood
which
thus
brighten
him
.
<EOS>
whatever
the
cause
,
I
could
not
meet
his
sunshine
with
cloud
.
<EOS>
if
this
be
my
last
moment
with
him
,
I
would
not
waste
it
in
force
,
unnatural
distance
.
<EOS>
I
love
him
well
 
<EOS>
too
well
not
to
smite
out
of
my
path
even
Jealousy
herself
,
when
she
would
have
obstruct
a
kind
farewell
.
<EOS>
a
cordial
word
from
his
lip
,
or
a
gentle
look
from
his
eye
,
would
do
me
good
,
for
all
the
span
of
life
that
remain
to
me
;
it
would
be
comfort
in
the
last
strait
of
loneliness
;
I
would
take
it
 
<EOS>
I
would
taste
the
elixir
,
and
pride
should
not
spill
the
cup
.
  
<EOS>
the
interview
would
be
short
,
of
course
:
he
would
say
to
me
just
what
he
have
say
to
each
of
the
assemble
pupil
;
he
would
take
and
hold
my
hand
two
minute
;
he
would
touch
my
cheek
with
his
lip
for
the
first
,
last
,
only
time
 
<EOS>
and
then
 
no
more
.
<EOS>
then
,
indeed
,
the
final
parting
,
then
the
wide
separation
,
the
great
gulf
I
could
not
pass
to
go
to
him
 
across
which
,
haply
,
he
would
not
glance
,
to
remember
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
take
my
hand
in
one
of
his
,
with
the
other
he
put
back
my
bonnet
;
he
look
into
my
face
,
his
luminous
smile
go
out
,
his
lip
express
something
almost
like
the
wordless
language
of
a
mother
who
find
a
child
greatly
and
unexpectedly
change
,
break
with
illness
,
or
wear
out

She

pierce
deep
than
I

a

open

with

a
deep
sob

with
thrilling

with
icy
shiver

with
strong
trembling

and
yet
with
relief
 
<EOS>
I
weep

<EOS>
"
leave

it

a
crisis

give

say
the
calm
Madame

when
M.

answer
deeply

harshly

and
briefly

<EOS>
in

grim

strange

strong

giving

<EOS>
"
Laissez

repeat
,
his

opening

all
quiver

he
speak

<EOS>
"
but
this

never

say
Madame

with
sternness

<EOS>
more
sternly
rejoin
her

"
Sortez

I
will

pertinaciously

<EOS>
"

the

He

I

"
what

injudicious

this

there
be
an
intonation
so
bitter
and
so
imperative
,
I
wonder
that
even
Madame
Beck
herself
could
for
one
moment
delay
obedience
;
but
she
stand
firm
<EOS>
;
she
gaze
upon
him
dauntless
;
she
meet
his
eye
,
forbid
and
fix
as
stone

<EOS>
She
be
open
her
lip
to
retort
;
I
see
over
all
M.
Paul
's
face
a
quick
rise
light
and
fire
;
I
can
hardly
tell
how
he
manage
the
movement
;
it
do
not
seem
violent
;
it
keep
the
form
of
courtesy
;
he
give
his
hand
;
it
scarce
touch
her

I
think
;
she
run
,
she
whirl
from
the
room
;
she
be
go
,
and
the
door
shut
,
in
one
second
.
  
<EOS>
the
flash
of
passion
be
all
over
very
soon
.
<EOS>
He
smile
as
he
tell
me
to
wipe
my
eye
;
he
wait
quietly
till
I
be
calm
,
drop
from
time
to
time
a
stilling

solace
word

<EOS>
Ere
long
I
sit

him
once
more

not
desperate

desolate

It

very

Must
I
tell
you
what
I
tell
Modeste
Beck
 
that

Must
I

and
teach
you
my

You

have
proof

still

my

"
then
,
in

you

<EOS>
without

his

his

offer
the

an
objection

I
re

tie
my
bonnet
:
I
be
ready

<EOS>
the
route
he
take
be
by
the
boulevard
:
he
several
time
make
me
sit
down
on
the
seat
station
under
the
lime
-
tree
;
he
do
not
ask
if
I
be
tired
,
but
look
,
and
draw
his
own
conclusion
.
  
<EOS>
"
all
these
weary
day

say
he
,
repeat
my
word
,
with
a
gentle
,
kindly
mimicry
of
my
voice
and
foreign
accent
,
not
new
from
his
lip
,
and
of
which
the
playful
banter
never
wound
,
not
even
when
couple
,
as
it
often
be

with
the
assertion

that
however
I

his
language

I
_
speak

to

from

I
lift
my

:
they

happy
now
,

they
would
have
be

<EOS>
"

,
after

there
be
no

Constancy

"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
I
be
not
pleasant
to
look
at
 
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
say
this
;
the
word
come
unbidden
:
<EOS>
I
never
remember
the
time
when
I
have
not
a
haunting
dread
of
what
may
be
the
degree
of
my
outward
deficiency
;
this
dread
press
me
at
the
moment
with
special
force
.
  
<EOS>
a
great
softness
pass
upon
his
countenance
;
his
violet
eye
grow
suffuse
and
glisten
under
their
deep
spanish
lash
<EOS>
:
he
start
up
;
"
let
us
walk
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
I
displease
your
eye
_
much
_
?
<EOS>
"
I
take
courage
to
urge
:
the
point
have
its
vital
import
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
stop
,
and
give
me
a
short
,
strong
answer
;
an
answer
which
silence
,
subdue
,
yet
profoundly
satisfied
.
<EOS>
ever
after
that
I
know
what
I
be
for
_
him
_
;
and
what
I
may
be
for
the
rest
of
the
world
,
I
cease
painfully
to
care
.
<EOS>
be
it
weak
to
lay
so
much
stress
on
an
opinion
about
appearance
?
<EOS>
I
fear
it
may
be
;
I
fear
it
be
;
but
in
that
case
I
must
avow
no
light
share
of
weakness
.
<EOS>
I
must
own
great
fear
of
displease
 
a
strong
wish
moderately
to
please
M.
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
Whither
we
ramble
,
I
scarce
know
.
<EOS>
Our
walk
be
long

yet
seem
short

the
path
be
pleasant

the
day
lovely

<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
talk
of
his
voyage
 
<EOS>
he
think
of
stay
away
three
year
.
<EOS>
on
his
return
from
Guadaloupe
,
he
look
forward
to
release
from
liability
and
a
clear
course
;
and
what
do
I
purpose
do
in
the
interval
of
his
absence
?
<EOS>
he
ask
.
<EOS>
I
have
talk
once
,
he
remind
me
,
of
try
to
be
independent
and
keep
a
little
school
of
my
own
:
have
I
drop
the
idea
?
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
I
have
not
:
I
be
do
my
good
to
save
what
would
enable
me
to
put
it
in
practice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
do
not
like
leave
me
in
the
Rue
Fossette
;
he
fear
I
should
miss
him
there
too
much
 
<EOS>
I
should
feel
desolate
 
<EOS>
I
should
grow
sad
 
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
certain
;
but
I
promise
to
do
my
good
to
endure
.
  
<EOS>
"
still
,
"
say
he
,
speak
low
,
"
there
be
another
objection
to
your
present
residence
.
<EOS>
I
should
wish
to
write
to
you
sometimes
:
it
would
not
be
well
to
have
any
uncertainty
about
the
safe
transmission
of
letter
;
and
in
the
Rue
Fossette
 
in
short
,
our
catholic
discipline
in
certain
matter
 
though
justifiable
and
expedient
 
may
possibly
,
under
peculiar
circumstance
,
become
liable
to
misapplication
 
perhaps
abuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
if
you
write
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
_
must
_
have
your
letter
;
and
I
_
will
_
have
them
:
ten
director
,
twenty
directresse
,
shall
not
keep
them
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
Protestant
:
I
will
not
bear
that
kind
of
discipline
:
<EOS>
Monsieur

I
_
will
not
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
doucement
 
doucement

"
rejoin
he

"
we
will
contrive
a
plan
;
we
have
our
resource

"
  
<EOS>
so
speak
,
he
pause
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
now
return
from
the
long
walk
.
<EOS>
We
have
reach
the
middle

a
clean
Faubourg

where
the

<EOS>
It

He

at

very
pretty

<EOS>
Its
delicate

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
"

I.
M.

smile
to
see
me
so
pleased

<EOS>
"
Must

sit
down
here
and
wait
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
in
a
whisper
,
half
awe
by
the
deep
pervading
hush
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
first
peep
into
one
or
two
other
nook

"
he
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
dare
<EOS>
you

the
freedom

I
inquire

<EOS>
"
yes

quietly

<EOS>
He
lead
the
way

<EOS>
I
be
show

<EOS>
"
there

say
M.
Paul
,
as
I
look
at
the
six
green

finally

I

with
a

<EOS>
produce

put

<EOS>
"
Voici

<EOS>
I
find
myself
in

scrupulously

Will

ask

take

<EOS>
and
what
do
I
say
to
M.

Emanuel

<EOS>
certain
juncture
of
our

must
always
be
difficult

<EOS>
certain
point

crisis
,
certain
feeling

joys

griefs

and
amazement
,
when
review
,
must
strike
us
as
thing
wildere
and
whirl
,
dim
as
a
wheel
fast
spin

<EOS>
I
can
no
more
remember
the
thought
or
the
word
of
the
ten
minute
succeed
this
disclosure
,
than
I
can
retrace
the
experience
of
my
early
year
of
life
:
and
yet
the
first
thing
distinct
to
me
be
the
consciousness
that
I
be
speak
very
fast
,
repeat
over
and
over
again
:
    
<EOS>
"
do

<EOS>
but
he
would
not
speak

<EOS>
His
pleased
silence
,
his
laugh
down

look

his

be
visible

me
now

how

I

He

extend

<EOS>
I
hardly

I

caress
the

then

the

in

they

speech

brittle

unmalleable

and
cold

He

my

He

He

His

Our

the

fresh
summer

form

it

better

and
I
take
a
delight
inexpressible
in
tend
M.

<EOS>
I
ask
him
whether
his

Père
Silas

know
what
he
have
do
 
whether
they
have
see
my

<EOS>
"

say
he

"
none

consecrate

unprofaned

<EOS>
to
speak

there
have
be
to

a
refinement

(

"
I
want
to
prove
to
Miss

that
I

could
_
keep
a
secret
.
<EOS>
how
often
have
she
taunt
me
with
lack
of
dignified
reserve
and
needful
caution
!
<EOS>
how
many
time
have
she
saucily
insinuate
that
all
my
affair
be
the
secret
of
Polichinelle
!
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
true
enough
:
I
have
not
spare
him
on
this
point
,
nor
perhaps
on
any
other
that
be
assailable
.
<EOS>
magnificent
-
minded
,
grand
-
hearted
,
dear
,
faulty
little
man
!
<EOS>
You
deserve
candour
,
and
from
me
always
have
it
.
  
<EOS>
continue
my
query
,
I
ask
to
whom
the
house
belong
,
who
be
my
landlord
,
the
amount
of
my
rent
.
<EOS>
He
instantly
give
me
these
particular
in
writing
;
he
have
foresee
and
prepare
all
thing
.
  
<EOS>
the
house
be
not
M.
Paul
's
 
that
I
guess
:
he
be
hardly
the
man
to
become
a
proprietor
;
I
more
than
suspect
in
him
a
lamentable
absence
of
the
saving
faculty
;
he
could
get
,
but
not
keep
;
he
need
a
treasurer
.
<EOS>
the
tenement
,
then
,
belong
to
a
citizen
in
the
Basse
-
Ville
 
<EOS>
a
man
of
substance
,
M.
Paul
say
;
he
startle
me
by
add
:
"
a
friend
of
yours
,
Miss
Lucy
,
a
person
who
have
a
most
respectful
regard
for
you
.
"
<EOS>
and
,
to
my
pleasant
surprise
,
I
find
the
landlord
be
none
other
than
M.
Miret
,
the
short
-
tempered
and
kind
-
hearted
bookseller
,
who
have
so
kindly
find
me
a
seat
<EOS>
that
eventful
night
in
the
park
.
<EOS>
It
seem
M.
Miret
be
,
in
his
station
,
rich
,
as
well
as
much
respected
,
and
possess
several
house
in
this
faubourg
;
the
rent
be
moderate
,
scarce
half
of
what
it
would
have
be
for
a
house
of
equal
size
nearer
the
centre
of
Villette
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
then
,
"
observe
M.
Paul
,
"
should
fortune
not
favour
you
,
though
I
think
she
will
,
I
have
the
satisfaction
to
think
you
be

good
hand
;
M.
Miret
will
not
be
extortionate
:
the
first
year

rent
you
have
already
in

saving
;
afterwards
Miss

must
trust
God

herself

now
,
what
will
you
do
for
pupil

I

my

right

<EOS>
by
way
of
lose
no

I
give
one
to
M.
Miret
yesterday

<EOS>
Should
you
object
to
begin
with
three

They

It

<EOS>
I
suppose
I

His

unaccountably

It

it
stir

up

escape
from

I
lack
not
word
now

fast
I
narrate
;
fluent
I
tell
my
tale

it
stream
on

I
go
back

the
night
in

I
mention
the
medicated
draught
 
why
it
be
give
 
its
goad
effect
 
how
it
have
tear
rest
from
under

shake
me
from

couch

carry
me
abroad
with
the
lure

a
vivid

solemn
fancy
 
a
summer
-
night
solitude
on
turf
,
under
tree
,
near
a
deep
,
cool
lakelet

<EOS>
I
tell
the
scene
realize
;
the
crowd
,
the
masque
,
the
music
,
the
lamp
,
the
splendours
,
the
gun
boom
afar

the
bell
sound
on

<EOS>
all
I
have
encounter
I
detail
,
all
I
have
recognise

hear

and
see

how
I

behold

watch
himself

how
I
listen

spur
me

the
smile

the
half

<EOS>
before
I
have
half
do
,
he
hold
both
my
hand
,
he
consult
my
eye
with
a
most
piercing
glance
:
there
be
something
in
his
face
which
tend
neither
to
calm
nor
to
put
me
down
;
he
forget
his
own
doctrine
,
he
forsake
his
own
system
of
repression
when
I
most
challenge
its
exercise

<EOS>
I
think
I
deserve
strong
reproof

when
have
we
our
desert
?
<EOS>
I
merit
severity
;
he
look
indulgence

<EOS>
to
my

self
I
seem
imperious

forbid

my

warm

jealous

and
haughty

not

such
a

he
gather
me
near
his

I
be
full
of
fault
;
he
take
them
and
me
all
home
.
<EOS>
for
the
moment
of
utmost
mutiny
,
he
reserve
the
one
deep
spell
of
peace
.
<EOS>
these
word
caress
my
ear
:

such
moonlight

Great

in

I

Heinrich
Mühler
,
a
wealthy
young
german
merchant
,
and
be
to
be
marry
in
the
course
of
a
year

<EOS>
some
of
M.
Emanuel

relation
and
connection
would
,
indeed
,
it
seem
,
have
like
him
to
marry
her
,
with
a
view
to
secure
her
fortune
in
the
family

but
to
himself
the
scheme
be
repugnant

the
idea
totally
inadmissible

We
reach
Madame

Jean

clock
toll
nine

<EOS>
at
this
hour
,
in

eighteen
month
since

have
this
man
at
my
side
bent
before
me
,
look
into
my
face

eye
,
and
arbitere
my
destiny

<EOS>
this
very
evening
he
have
again
stoop

gaze
,
and
decreed
.
<EOS>
how
different
the
look
 
<EOS>
how
far
otherwise
the
fate
!
  
<EOS>
He
deem
me
bear
under
his
star
:
he
seem
to
have
spread
over
me
its
beam
like
a
banner
.
<EOS>
once
 
unknown
,
and
unloved
,
I
hold
him
harsh
and
strange
;
the
low
stature
,
the
wiry
make
,
the
angle
,
the
darkness
,
the
manner
,
displease
me
.
<EOS>
now
,
penetrate
with
his

live
by
his

have
his
worth
by
intellect

his
goodness
by
heart

I
prefer
him
before
all
humanity

We
part
:
he
give
me
his
pledge
,
and
then
his
farewell
.
<EOS>

man

not

<EOS>
love
be

<EOS>
fear
sometimes
imagine
a
vain
thing
.
<EOS>
those
year
of
absence
!
<EOS>
how
have
I
sicken
over
their
anticipation
!
<EOS>
the
woe
they
must
bring
seem
certain
as
death
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
nature
of
their
course
:
<EOS>
I
never
have
doubt
how
it
would
harrow
as
it
go
.
<EOS>
the
juggernaut
on
his
car
tower
there
a
grim
load
.
<EOS>
see
him
draw
nigh
,
bury
his
broad
wheel
in
the
oppressed
soil
 
I
,
the
prostrate
votary
 
feel
beforehand
the
annihilating
craunch
.
  
<EOS>
strange
to
say
 
strange
,
yet
true
,
and
own
many
parallel
in
life
's
experience
 
that
anticipatory
craunch
prove
all
 
<EOS>
yes
 
<EOS>
nearly
_
<EOS>
all
_
<EOS>
the
torture
.
<EOS>
the
great
Juggernaut
,
in
his
great
chariot
,
draw
on
lofty
,
loud
,
and
sullen
.
<EOS>
He
pass
quietly
,
like
a
shadow
sweep
the
sky
,
at
noon
.
<EOS>
nothing
but
a
chilling
dimness
be
see
or
feel
.
<EOS>
I
look
up

<EOS>
chariot
and
demon
charioteer
be

by
;
the
votary
still
live

<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
be
away
three
year
.
<EOS>
reader
,
they
be
the
three
happy
year
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
do
you
scout
the
paradox
?
<EOS>
listen
.
<EOS>
I
commence
my
school
;
I
work
 
<EOS>
I
work
hard
.
<EOS>
I
deem
myself
the
steward
of
his
property
,
and
determine
,
God
willing
,
to
render
a
good
account
.
<EOS>
pupil
come
 
burgher
at
first
 
a
high
class
ere
long
.
<EOS>
about
the
middle
of
the
second
year
an
unexpected
chance
throw
into
my
hand
an
additional
hundred
pound
:
one
day
I
receive
from
England
a
letter
contain
that
sum
.
<EOS>
It
come
from
Mr.
Marchmont
,
the
cousin
and
heir
of
my
dear
and
dead
mistress
.
<EOS>
He
be
just
recover
from
a
dangerous
illness
;
the
money
be
a
peace
-
offering
to
his
conscience
,
reproach
him
in
the
matter
of
<EOS>
,
I
know
not
what
,
paper
or
memorandum
find
after
his
kinswoman
's
death
 
name
or
recommend
Lucy
Snowe
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Barrett
have
give
him
my
address
.
<EOS>
how
far
his
conscience
have
be
sin
against
,
I
never
inquire
.
<EOS>
I
ask
no
question
,
but
take
the
cash
and
make
it
useful
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
hundred
pound
I
venture
to
take
the
house
adjoin
mine
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
leave
that
which
M.
Paul
have
choose
,
in
which
he
have
leave
,
and
where
he
expect
again
to
find
me
.
<EOS>
My
externat
become
a
pensionnat
;
that
also
prosper
.
  
<EOS>
the
secret
of
my
success
do
not
lie
so
much
in
myself
,
in
any
endowment
,
any
power
of
mine
,
as
in
a
new
state
of
circumstance
,
a
wonderfully
change
life
,
a
relieved
heart
.
<EOS>
the
spring
which
move
my
energy
lie
far
away
beyond
sea
,
in
an
indian
isle
.
<EOS>
at
parting
,
I
have
be
leave
a
legacy
;
such
a
thought
for
the
present
,
such
a
hope
for
the
future
,
such
a
motive
for
a
persevering
,
a
laborious
,
an
enterprising
,
a
patient
and
a
brave
course
 
<EOS>
I
_
<EOS>
could
_
not
flag
.
<EOS>
few
thing
shake
me
now
;
few
thing
have
importance
to
vex
,
intimidate
,
or
depress
me
:
most
thing
please
 
<EOS>
mere
trifle
have
a
charm
.
  
<EOS>
do
not
think
that
this
genial
flame
sustain
itself
,
or
live
wholly
on
a
bequeathed
hope
or
a
part
promise
.
<EOS>
a
generous
provider
supply
bounteous
fuel
.
<EOS>
I
be
spare
all
chill
,
all
stint
;
I
be
not
suffer
to
fear
penury
;
I
be
not
try
with
suspense
.
<EOS>
by
every
vessel
he
write
;
he
write
as
he
give
and
as
he
love
,
in
full
-
handed
,
full
-
hearted
plenitude
.
<EOS>
He
write
because
he
like
to
write
;
he
do
not
abridge
,
because
he
care
not
to
abridge
.
<EOS>
He
sit
down
,
he
take
pen
and
paper
,
because
he
love
Lucy
and
have
much
to
say
to
her
;
because
he
be
faithful
and
thoughtful
,
because
he
be
tender
and
true
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
sham
and
no
cheat
,
and
no
hollow
unreal
in
him
.
<EOS>
Apology
never
drop
her
slippery
oil
on
his
lip
 
never
proffer
,
by
his
pen
,
her
coward
feint
and
paltry
nullity
:
he
would
give
neither
a
stone
,
nor
an
excuse
 
neither
a
scorpion
;
nor
a
disappointment
;
his
letter
be
real
food
that
nourish
,
living
water
that
refresh
.
  
<EOS>
and
be
I
grateful
?
<EOS>
God
know
!
<EOS>
I
believe
that
scarce
a
living
being
so
remember
,
so
sustained
,
deal
with
in
kind
so
constant
,
honourable
and
noble
,
could
be
otherwise
than
grateful
to
the
death
.
  
<EOS>
Adherent
to
his
own
religion
(
in
him
be
not
the
stuff
of
which
be
make
the
facile
apostate
)
<EOS>
,
he
freely
leave
me
my
pure
faith
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
tease
nor
tempt
.
<EOS>
He
say
:
    
"
remain
a
Protestant
.
<EOS>
My
little
English
Puritan
,
I
love
Protestantism
in
you
.
<EOS>
I
own
its
severe
charm
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
its
ritual
I
can
not
receive
myself
,
but
it
be
the
sole
creed
for
"
Lucy
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
all
Rome
could
not
put
into
him
bigotry
,
nor
the
Propaganda
itself
make
him
a
real
Jesuit
.
<EOS>
He
be
bear
honest
,
and
not
false
 
artless
,
and
not
cunne
 
a
freeman
,
and
not
a
slave
.
<EOS>
His
tenderness
have
render
him
ductile
in
a
priest
's
hand
,
his
affection
,
his
devotedness
,
his
sincere
pious
enthusiasm
blind
his
kind
eye
sometimes
,
make
him
abandon
justice
to
himself
to
do
the
work
of
craft
,
and
serve
the
end
of
selfishness
;
but
these
be
fault
so
rare
to
find
,
so
costly
to
their
owner
to
indulge
,
we
scarce
know
whether
they
will
not
one
day
be
reckon
amongst
the
jewel
.
     
<EOS>
and
now
the
three
year
be
past
:
M.
Emanuel
's
return
be
fix
.
<EOS>
It
be
Autumn
;
he
be
to
be
with
me
ere
the
mist
of
November
come
.
<EOS>
My
school
flourish
,
my
house
be
ready
:
I
have
make
him
a
little
library
,
fill
its
shelf
with
the
book
he
leave
in
my
care
:
I
have
cultivate
out
of
love
for
him
<EOS>
(
I
be
naturally
no
florist
)
<EOS>
the
plant
he
prefer
,
and
some
of
them
be
yet
in
bloom
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
love
him
when
he
go
away
;
I
love
him
now
in
another
degree
:
he
be
more
my
own
.
  
<EOS>
the
sun
pass
the
equinox
;
the
day
shorten
,
the
leave
grow
sere
;
but
 
he
be
come
.
  
<EOS>
frost
appear
at
night
;
November
have
send
his
fog
in
advance
;
the
wind
take
its
autumn
moan
;
but
 
he
be
come
.
  
<EOS>
the
sky
hang
full
and
dark
 
a
wrack
sail
from
the
west
;
the
cloud
cast
themselves
into
strange
form
 
arch
and
broad
radiation
;
there
rise
resplendent
morning
 
glorious
,
royal
,
purple
as
monarch
in
his
state
;
the
heavens
be
one
flame
;
so
wild
be
they
,
they
rival
battle
at
its
thick
 
<EOS>
so
bloody
,
they
shame
victory
in
her
pride
.
<EOS>
I
know
some
sign
of
the
sky
;
I
have
note
them
ever
since
childhood
.
<EOS>
God
watch
that
sail
!
<EOS>
oh
!
guard
it
!
  
<EOS>
the
wind
shift
to
the
west
.
<EOS>
peace
,
peace
,
Banshee
 
"
keen
"
at
every
window
!
<EOS>
It
will
rise
 
<EOS>
it
will
swell
 
it
shriek
out
long
:
<EOS>
wander
as
I
may
through
the
house
this
night
,
I
can
not
lull
the
blast
.
<EOS>
the
advance
hour
make
it
strong
:
by
midnight
,
all
sleepless
watcher
hear
and
fear
a
wild
south
-
west
storm
.
<EOS>
that
storm
roar
frenzy
,
for
seven
day
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
cease
till
the
Atlantic
be
strew
with
wreck
:
it
do
not
lull
till
the
deep
have
gorge
their
full
of
sustenance
.
<EOS>
not
till
the
destroy
angel
of
temp
have
achieve
his
perfect
work
,
would
he
fold
the
wing
whose
waft
be
thunder
 
<EOS>
the
tremor
of
whose
plume
be
storm
.
  
<EOS>
peace
,
be
still
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
a
thousand
weeper
,
pray
in
agony
on
wait
shore
,
listen
for
that
voice
,
but
it
be
not
uttered
 
not
utter
till
;
<EOS>
when
the
hush
come
,
some
could
not
feel
it
:
<EOS>
till
,
when
the
sun
return
,
his
light
be
night
to
some
!
  
<EOS>
here
pause
:
pause
at
once
.
<EOS>
there
be
enough
say
.
<EOS>
trouble
no
quiet
,
kind
heart
;
leave
sunny
imagination
hope
.
<EOS>
let
it
be
theirs
to
conceive
the
delight
of
joy
bear
again
fresh
out
of
great
terror
,
the
rapture
of
rescue
from
peril
,
the
wondrous
reprieve
from
dread
,
the
fruition
of
return
.
<EOS>
let
them
picture
union
and
a
happy
succeed
life
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
prosper
all
the
day
of
her
life
;
so
do
Père
Silas
;
Madame
Walravens
fulfil
her
ninetieth
year
before
she
die
