His

always

;
    
but
on
reflection
it
appear
that
her
proceeding
be
not
very
different
    
from

since
Science

whether

<EOS>
be
she

<EOS>
and
what

of

<EOS>
be
the

<EOS>
probably
the

;
else
why

<EOS>
why
be

<EOS>
She
who
raise
these
question
in
Daniel
Deronda
's
mind
be
occupy
in
gambling
:
not
in
the
open
air
under
a
southern
sky
,
toss
copper
on
a
ruin
wall
,
with
rag
about
her
limb
;
but
in
one
of
those
splendid
resort
which
the
enlightenment
of
age
have
prepare
for
the
same
specie
of
pleasure
at
a
heavy
cost
of
gilt
moulding
,
dark
-
toned
color
and
chubby
nudity
,
all
correspondingly
heavy
 
form
a
suitable
condenser
for
human
breath
belong
,
in
great
part
,
to
the
high
fashion
,
and
not
easily
procurable
to
be
breathe
in
elsewhere
in
the
like
proportion
,
at
least
by
person
of
little
fashion
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
near
four
o'clock
on
a
September
day
,
so
that
the
atmosphere
be
well
-
brew
to
a
visible
haze
.
<EOS>
there
be
deep
stillness
,
break
only
by
a
light
rattle
,
a
light
chink
,
a
small
sweeping
sound
,
and
an
occasional
monotone
in
French
,
such
as
may
be
expect
to
issue
from
an
ingeniously
construct
automaton
.
<EOS>
round
two
long
table
be
gather
two
serried
crowd
of
human
being
,
all
save
one
have
their
face
and
attention
bent
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
the
one
exception
be
a
melancholy
little
boy
,
with
his
knee
and
calf
simply
in
their
natural
clothing
of
epidermis
,
but
for
the
rest
of
his
person
in
a
fancy
dress
.
<EOS>
He
alone
have
his
face
turn
toward
the
doorway
,
and
fix
on
it
the
blank
gaze
of
a
bedizen
child
station
as
a
masquerade
advertisement
on
the
platform
of
an
itinerant
show
,
stand
close
behind
a
lady
deeply
engage
at
the
roulette
-
table
.
  
<EOS>
about
this
table
fifty
or
sixty
person
be
assemble
,
many
in
the
outer
row
,
where
there
be
occasionally
a
deposit
of
new

comer
,
be
mere
spectator
,
only
that
one
of
them
,
usually
a
woman
,
may
now
and
then
be
observe
put
down
a
five
-
franc
with
a
simper
air
,
just
to
see
what
the
passion
of
gambling
really
be
.
<EOS>
those
who
be
take
their
pleasure
at
a
high
strength
,
and
be
absorb
in
play
,
show
very
distant
variety
of
european
type
:
livonian
and
spanish
,
Graeco
-
italian
and
miscellaneous
german
,
english
aristocratic
and
english
plebeian
.
<EOS>
here
certainly
be
a
striking
admission
of
human
equality
.
<EOS>
the
white
bejewel
finger
of
an
english
countess
be
very
near
touch
a
bony
,
yellow
,
crab
-
like
hand
stretch
a
bare
wrist
to
clutch
a
heap
of
coin
 
a
hand
easy
to
sort
with
the
square
,
gaunt
face
,
deep
-
set
eye
,
grizzle
eyebrow
,
and
ill
-
comb
scanty
hair
which
seem
a
slight
metamorphosis
of
the
vulture
.
<EOS>
and
where
else
would
her
ladyship
have
graciously
consent
to
sit
by
that
dry
-
lipped
feminine
figure
prematurely
old
,
withered
after
short
bloom
like
her
artificial
flower
,
hold
a
shabby
velvet
reticule
before
her
,
and
occasionally
put
in
her
mouth
the
point
with
which
she
prick
her
card
?
<EOS>
there
too
,
very
near
the
fair
countess
,
be
a
respectable
London
tradesman
,
blonde
and
soft
-
handed
,
his
sleek
hair
scrupulously
part
behind
and
before
,
conscious
of
circular
address
to
the
nobility
and
gentry
,
whose
distinguished
patronage
enable
him
to
take
his
holiday
fashionably
,
and
to
a
certain
extent
in
their
distinguished
company
.
<EOS>
not
his
gambler
's
passion
that
nullifie
appetite
,
but
a
well
-
feed
leisure
,
which
,
in
the
interval
of
win
money
in
business
and
spend
it
showily
,
see
no
well
resource
than
win
money
in
play
and
spend
it
yet
more
showily
 
reflect
always
that
Providence
have
never
manifest
any
disapprobation
of
his
amusement
,
and
dispassionate
enough
to
leave
off
if
the
sweetness
of
win
much
and
see
other
lose
have
turn
to
the
sourness
of
lose
much
and
see
other
win
.
<EOS>
for
the
vice
of
gambling
lie
in
lose
money
at
it
.
<EOS>
in
his
bearing
there
may
be
something
of
the
tradesman
,
but
in
his
pleasure
he
be
fit
to
rank
with
the
owner
of
the
old
title
.
<EOS>
stand
close
to
his
chair
be
a
handsome
italian
,
calm
,
statuesque
,
reach
across
him
to
place
the
first
pile
of
napoleon
from
a
new
bagful
<EOS>
just
bring
him
by
an
envoy
with
a
scrolled
mustache
.
<EOS>
the
pile
be
in
half
a
minute
push
over
to
an
old
bewigged
woman
with
eye
-
glass
pinch
her
nose
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
slight
gleam
,
a
faint
mumbling
smile
about
the
lip
of
the
old
woman
;
but
the
statuesque
Italian
remain
impassive
,
and
 
probably
secure
in
an
infallible
system
which
place
his
foot
on
the
neck
of
chance
 
immediately
prepare
a
new
pile
.
<EOS>
so
do
a
man
with
the
air
of
an
emaciate
beau
or
wear
-
out
libertine
,
who
look
at
life
through
one
eye
-
glass
,
and
hold
out
his
hand
tremulously
when
he
ask
for
change
.
<EOS>
It
could
surely
be
no
severity
of
system
,
but
rather
some
dream
of
white
crow
,
or
the
induction
that
the
eighth
of
the
month
be
lucky
,
which
inspire
the
fierce
yet
totter
impulsiveness
of
his
play
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
while
every
single
player
differ
markedly
from
every
other
,
there
be
a
certain
uniform
negativeness
of
expression
which
have
the
effect
of
a
mask
 
as
if
they
have
all
eat
of
some
root
that
for
the
time
compel
the
brain
of
each
to
the
same
narrow
monotony
of
action
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
's
first
thought
when
his
eye
fall
on
this
scene
of
dull
,
gas
-
poison
absorption
,
be
that
the
gambling
of
spanish
shepherd
<EOS>
-
boy
have
seem
to
him
more
enviable
:
 
so
far
Rousseau
may
be
justify
in
maintain
that
art
and
science
have
do
a
poor
service
to
mankind
.
<EOS>
but
suddenly
he
feel
the
moment
become
dramatic
.
<EOS>
His
attention
be
arrest
by
a
young
lady
who
,
stand
at
an
angle
not
far
from
him
,
be
the
last
to
whom
his
eye
travel
.
<EOS>
She
be
bend
and
speak
English
to
a
middle
-
aged
lady
seat
at
play
beside
her
:
but
the
next
instant
she
return
to
her
play
,
and
show
the
full
height
of
a
graceful
figure
,
with
a
face
which
may
possibly
be
look
at
without
admiration
,
but
could
hardly
be
pass
with
indifference
.
  
<EOS>
the
inward
debate
which
she
raise
in
Deronda
give
to
his
eye
a
grow
expression
of
scrutiny
,
tend
farther
and
farther
away
from
the
glow
of
mingle
undefined
sensibility
form
admiration
.
<EOS>
at
one
moment
they
follow
the
movement
of
the
figure
,
of
the
arm
and
hand
,
as
this
problematic
sylph
bend
forward
to
deposit
her
stake
with
an
air
of
firm
choice
;
and
the
next
they
return
to
the
face
which
,
at
present
unaffected
by
beholder
,
be
direct
steadily
toward
the
game
.
<EOS>
the
sylph
be
a
winner
;
and
as
her
taper
finger
,
delicately
glove
in
pale
-
gray
,
be
adjust
the
coin
which
have
be
push
toward
her
in
order
to
pass
them
back
again
to
the
winning
point
,
she
look
round
her
with
a
survey
too
markedly
cold
and
neutral
not
to
have
in
it
a
little
of
that
nature
which
we
call
art
conceal
an
inward
exultation
.
  
<EOS>
but
in
the
course
of
that
survey
her
eye
meet
Deronda
's
,
and
instead
of
avert
them
as
she
would
have
desire
to
do
,
she
be
unpleasantly
conscious
that
they
be
arrest
 
how
long
?
<EOS>
the
dart
sense
that
he
be
measure
her
and
look
down
on
her
as
an
inferior
,
that
he
be
of
different
quality
from
the
human
dross
around
her
,
that
he
feel
himself
in
a
region
outside
and
above
her
,
and
be
examine
her
as
a
speciman
of
a
low
order
,
rouse
a
tingling
resentment
which
stretch
the
moment
with
conflict
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
bring
the
blood
to
her
cheek
,
but
it
send
it
away
from
her
lip
.
<EOS>
She
control
herself
by
the
help
of
an
inward
defiance
,
and
without
other
sign
of
emotion
than
this
lip
-
paleness
turn
to
her
play
.
<EOS>
but
Deronda
's
gaze
seem
to
have
act
as
an
evil
eye
.
<EOS>
Her
stake
be
go
.
<EOS>
no
matter
;
she
have
be
win
ever
since
she
take
to
roulette
with
a
few
napoleon
at
command
,
and
have
a
considerable
reserve
.
<EOS>
She
have
begin
to
believe
in
her
luck
,
other
have
begin
to
believe
in
it
:
she
have
vision
of
be
follow
by
a
_
cortège
_
who
would
worship
her
as
a
goddess
of
luck
and
watch
her
play
as
a
direct
augury
.
<EOS>
such
thing
have
be
know
of
male
gambler
;
why
should
not
a
woman
have
a
like
supremacy
?
<EOS>
Her
friend
and
chaperon
who
have
not
wish
her
to
play
at
first
be
begin
to
approve
,
only
administer
the
prudent
advice
to
stop
at
the
right
moment
and
carry
money
back
to
England
 
advice
to
which
Gwendolen
have
reply
that
she
care
for
the
excitement
of
play
,
not
the
winning
.
<EOS>
on
that
supposition
the
present
moment
ought
to
have
make
the
flood
-
tide
in
her
eager
experience
of
gambling
.
<EOS>
yet
,
when
her
next
stake
be
sweep
away
,
she
feel
the
orbit
of
her
eye
get
hot
,
and
the
certainty
she
have
(
without
look
)
of
that
man
still
watch
her
be
something
like
a
pressure
which
begin
to
be
torture
.
<EOS>
the
more
reason
to
her
why
she
should
not
flinch
,
but
go
on
playing
as
if
she
be
indifferent
to
loss
or
gain
.
<EOS>
Her
friend
touch
her
elbow
and
propose
that
they
should
quit
the
table
.
<EOS>
for
reply
Gwendolen
put
ten
louis
on
the
same
spot
:
she
be
in
that
mood
of
defiance
in
which
the
mind
lose
sight
of
any
end
beyond
the
satisfaction
of
enraged
resistance
;
and
with
the
puerile
stupidity
of
a
dominant
impulse
include
luck
among
its
object
of
defiance
.
<EOS>
since
she
be
not
win
strikingly
,
the
next
good
thing
be
to
lose
strikingly
.
<EOS>
She
control
her
muscle
,
and
show
no
tremor
of
mouth
or
hand
.
<EOS>
each
time
her
stake
be
sweep
off
<EOS>
she
double
it
.
<EOS>
many
be
now
watch
her
,
but
the
sole
observation
she
be
conscious
of
be
Deronda
's
,
who
,
though
she
never
look
toward
him
,
she
be
sure
have
not
move
away
.
<EOS>
such
a
drama
take
no
long
while
to
play
out
:
development
and
catastrophe
can
often
be
measure
by
nothing
clumsy
than
the
moment
-
hand
.
"
<EOS>
Faites
votre
jeu
,
mesdames
et
monsieur
,
"
say
the
automatic
voice
of
destiny
from
between
the
mustache
and
imperial
of
the
croupier
:
and
Gwendolen
's
arm
be
stretch
to
deposit
her
last
poor
heap
of
napoleon
.
"
<EOS>
Le
jeu
<EOS>
ne
va
<EOS>
plus
,
"
say
destiny
.
<EOS>
and
in
five
second
Gwendolen
turn
from
the
table
,
but
turn
resolutely
with
her
face
toward
Deronda
and
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
smile
of
irony
in
his
eye
as
their
glance
meet
;
but
it
be
at
least
better
that
he
should
have
disregard
her
as
one
of
an
insect
swarm
who
have
no
individual
physiognomy
.
<EOS>
besides
,
in
spite
of
his
superciliousness
and
irony
,
it
be
difficult
to
believe
that
he
do
not
admire
her
spirit
as
well
as
her
person
:
<EOS>
he
be
young
,
handsome
,
distinguish
in
appearance
 
not
one
of
these
ridiculous
and
dowdy
Philistines
who
think
it
incumbent
on
them
to
blight
the
gaming
-
table
with
a
sour
look
of
protest
as
they
pass
by
it
.
<EOS>
the
general
conviction
that
we
be
admirable
do
not
easily
give
way
before
a
single
negative
;
rather
when
any
of
Vanity
's
large
family
,
male
or
female
,
find
their
performance
receive
coldly
,
they
be
apt
to
believe
that
a
little
more
of
it
will
win
over
the
unaccountable
dissident
.
<EOS>
in
Gwendolen
's
habit
of
mind
it
have
be
take
for
grant
that
she
know
what
be
admirable
and
that
she
herself
be
admire
.
<EOS>
this
basis
of
her
thinking
have
receive
a
disagreeable
concussion
,
and
reel
a
little
,
but
be
not
easily
to
be
overthrow
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
evening
the
same
room
be
more
stiflingly
heated
,
be
brilliant
with
gas
and
with
the
costume
of
lady
who
float
their

along
it
or

the

Miss
Harleth

<EOS>
"
yes

she
have
get
herself
up
as
a
sort
of
serpent
now
 
all
green
and
silver
,
and
wind
her
neck
about
a
little
more
than
usual
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
she
must
always
be
do
something
extraordinary

She

that

You

"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
certainly
very
graceful
;
but
she
want
a
tinge
of
color
in
her
cheek

<EOS>
It
be
a
sort
of
Lamia
beauty
she
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
on
the
contrary
,
I
think
her
complexion
one
of
her
chief
charm
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
warm
paleness
;
it
look
thoroughly
healthy
.
<EOS>
and
that
delicate
nose
with
its
gradual
little
upward
curve
be
distract
.
<EOS>
and
then
her
mouth
 
there
never
be
a
pretty
mouth
,
the
lip
curl
backward
so
finely
,
eh
,
Mackworth
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
think
so
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
endure
that
sort
of
mouth
.
<EOS>
It
look
so
self
-
complacent
,
as
if
it
know
its
own
beauty
 
<EOS>
the
curve
be
too
immovable
.
<EOS>
I
like
a
mouth
that
tremble
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
for
my
part
,
I
think
her
odious

a
dowager

<EOS>
"
It
be
wonderful
what
unpleasant

into
vogue

<EOS>
the
remark
that
Gwendolen
wind
her
neck
about
more
than
usual
this
evening
be
true
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
that
she
may
carry
out
the
serpent
idea
more
completely
:
it
be
that
she
watch
for
any
chance
of
see
Deronda

so
that
she
may
inquire
about
this
stranger
,
under

at

"
Mr.

you

Gwendolen

not

eagerly

rather
with
a
certain
languor
of
utterance
which
she
sometimes
give
to
her
clear
soprano

<EOS>
"
who
be
that

there

Dreadful

terrace

he
never
speak

be
not

<EOS>
He
look
bored

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
another
reason
why
I
should
like

know
him

<EOS>
I
be
always
bored

<EOS>
"
I
should
think
he
would
be
charm
to
have
an
introduction

Shall
I
bring
it
about
?
<EOS>
Will
you
allow
it

why
not

since
he

It
be
a

of

bored

continue
Madame
von
Langen

when

away

until

always
seem
eager

something
from
morning
till
night

"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
just
because
I
be
bored
to
death

if
I
be
to
leave
off
play
I
must
break
my
arm

my
collar

bone

<EOS>
I
must
make
something
happen
;
unless
you
will
go
into
Switzerland

take
me
up
the
Matterhorn

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

perhaps
this
Mr.

acquaintance
will
do
instead
of
the
Matterhorn

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
Gwendolen
do
not
make
Deronda
's
acquaintance
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Vandernoodt
do
not
succeed
in
bring
him
up
to
her
that
evening
,
and
when
she
re
-
enter
her
own
room
she
find
a
letter
recall
her
home
.
      
<EOS>
this
man
contrive
a
secret
'
<EOS>
twixt
us
two
,
  
<EOS>
that
he
may
quell
me
with
his
meeting
eye
  
<EOS>
like
one
who
quell
a
lioness
at
bay
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
the
letter
Gwendolen
find
on
her
table
:
        
DEAREST
CHILD
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
expect
to
hear
from
you
for
a
week
.
<EOS>
in
    
your
last
you
say
the
Langens
thought
of
leave
Leubronn
and
go
    
to
Baden
.
<EOS>
how
could
you
be
so
thoughtless
as
to
leave
me
in
    
uncertainty
about
your
address
?
<EOS>
I
be
in
the
great
anxiety
lest
this
    
should
not
reach
you
.
<EOS>
in
any
case
,
you
be
to
come
home
at
the
end
of
    
September
,
and
I
must
now
entreat
you
to
return
as
quickly
as
    
possible
,
for
if
you
spend
all
your
money
it
would
be
out
of
my
power
    
to
send
you
any
more
,
and
you
must
not
borrow
of
the
Langens
,
for
I
    
could
not
repay
them
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
sad
truth
,
my
child
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
    
prepare
you
for
it
better
 
but
<EOS>
a
dreadful
calamity
have
befall
us
    
all
.
<EOS>
You
know
nothing
about
business
and
will
not
understand
it
;
but
    
Grapnell
&
Co.
have
fail
for
a
million
,
and
we
be
totally
    
ruin
 
your
aunt
Gascoigne
as
well
as
I
,
only
that
your
uncle
have
his
    
benefice
,
so
that
by
put
down
their
carriage
and
get
interest
    
for
the
boy
,
the
family
can
go
on
.
<EOS>
all
the
property
our
poor
father
    
save
for
us
go
to
pay
the
liability
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
I
can
call
    
my
own
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
you
should
know
this
at
once
,
though
it
rend
my
    
heart
to
have
to
tell
it
you
.
<EOS>
of
course
we
can
not
help
think
what
a
    
pity
it
be
that
you
go
away
just
when
you
do
.
<EOS>
but
I
shall
never
    
reproach
you
,
my
dear
child
;
I
would
save
you
from
all
trouble
if
I
    
could
.
<EOS>
on
your
way
home
you
will
have
time
to
prepare
yourself
for
the
    
change
you
will
find
.
<EOS>
We
shall
perhaps
leave
Offendene
at
once
,
for
we
    
hope
that
Mr.
Haynes
,
who
want
it
before
,
may
be
ready
to
take
it
    
off
my
hand
.
<EOS>
of
course
we
can
not
go
to
the
rectory
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
    
corner
there
to
spare
.
<EOS>
We
must
get
some
hut
or
other
to
shelter
us
,
    
and
<EOS>
we
must
live
on
your
uncle
Gascoigne
's
charity
,
until
I
see
what
    
else
can
be
do
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
be
able
to
pay
the
debt
to
the
    
tradesman
besides
the
servant
'
wage
.
<EOS>
summon
up
your
fortitude
,
my
    
dear
child
;
we
must
resign
ourselves
to
God
's
will
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
hard
to
    
resign
one
's
self
to
Mr.
Lassman
's
wicked
recklessness
,
which
they
say
    
be
the
cause
of
the
failure
.
<EOS>
Your
poor
sister
can
only
cry
with
me
    
and
give
me
no
help
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
once
here
,
there
may
be
a
break
in
    
the
cloud
 
<EOS>
I
always
feel
it
impossible
that
you
can
have
be
mean
    
for
poverty
.
<EOS>
if
the
Langens
wish
to
remain
abroad
,
perhaps
you
can
put
    
yourself
under
some
one
else
's
care
for
the
journey
.
<EOS>
but
come
as
soon
    
as
you
can
to
your
afflict
and
love
mamma
,
      
FANNY
DAVILOW
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
effect
of
this
letter
on
Gwendolen
be
half
-
stupefy
.
<EOS>
the
implicit
confidence
that
her
destiny
must
be
one
of
luxurious
ease
,
where
any
trouble
that
occur
would
be
well
clothe
and
provide
for
,
have
be
strong
in
her
own
mind
than
in
her
mamma
's
,
be
feed
there
by
her
youthful
blood
and
that
sense
of
superior
claim
which
make
a
large
part
of
her
consciousness
.
<EOS>
It
be
almost
as
difficult
for
her
to
believe
suddenly
that
her
position
have
become
one
of
poverty
and
of
humiliating
dependence
,
as
it
would
have
be
to
get
into
the
strong
current
of
her
bloom
life
the
chill
sense
that
her
death
would
really
come
.
<EOS>
She
stand
motionless
for
a
few
minute
,
then
toss
off
her
hat
and
automatically
look
in
the
glass
.
<EOS>
the
coil
of
her
smooth
light
-
brown
hair
be
still
in
order
perfect
enough
for
a
ball
-
room
;
and
as
on
other
night
,
Gwendolen
may
have
look
lingeringly
at
herself
for
pleasure
(
surely
an
allowable
indulgence
)
;
but
now
she
take
no
conscious
note
of
her
reflected
beauty
,
and
simply
stare
right
before
her
as
if
she
have
be
jar
by
a
hateful
sound
and
be
wait
for
any
sign
of
its
cause
.
<EOS>
by
-
and
-
by
she
throw
herself
in
the
corner
of
the
red
velvet
sofa
,
take
up
the
letter
again
and
read
it
twice
deliberately
,
let
it
at
last
fall
on
the
ground
,
while
she
rest
her
clasped
hand
on
her
lap
and
sit
perfectly
still
,
shed
no
tear
.
<EOS>
Her
impulse
be
to
survey
and
resist
the
situation
rather
than
to
wail
over
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
inward
exclamation
of
"
poor
mamma
!
"
<EOS>
Her
mamma
have
never
seem
to
get
much
enjoyment
out
of
life
,
and
if
Gwendolen
have
be
at
this
moment
dispose
to
feel
pity
she
would
have
bestow
it
on
herself
 
for
<EOS>
be
she
not
naturally
and
rightfully
the
chief
object
of
her
mamma
's
anxiety
too
?
<EOS>
but
it
be
anger
,
it
be
resistance
that
possess
her
;
it
be
bitter
vexation
that
she
have
lose
her
gain
at
roulette
,
whereas
if
her
luck
have
continue
through
this
one
day
she
would
have
have
a
handsome
sum
to
carry
home
,
or
she
may
have
go
on
play
and
win
enough
to
support
them
all
.
<EOS>
even
now
be
it
not
possible
?
<EOS>
She
have
only
four
napoleon
leave
in
her
purse
,
but
she
possess
some
ornament
which
she
could
sell
:
a
practice
so
common
in
stylish
society
at
german
bath
that
there
be
no
need
to
be
ashamed
of
it
;
and
even
if
she
have
not
receive
her
mamma
's
letter
,
she
would
probably
have
decide
to
get
money
for
an
etruscan
necklace
which
she
happen
not
to
have
be
wear
since
her
arrival
;
nay
,
she
may
have
do
so
with
an
agreeable
sense
that
she
be
live
with
some
intensity
and
escape
humdrum
.
<EOS>
with
ten
louis
at
her
disposal
and
a
return
of
her
former
luck
,
which
seem
probable
,
what
could
she
do
better
than
go
on
play
for
a
few
day

<EOS>
if
her
friend
at
home
disapprove
of
the
way
in
which
she
get
the
money

as
they
certainly
would
,
still
the
money
would
be
there

<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
imagination
dwelt
on
this
course
and
create
agreeable
consequence
,
but
not
with
unbroken
confidence
and
rise
certainty
as
it
would
have
do
if
she
have
be
touch
with
the
gambler
's
mania
.
<EOS>
She
have
go
to
the
roulette
-
table
not
because
of
passion
,
but
in
search
of
it
:
her
mind
be
still
sanely
capable
of
picture
balanced
probability
,
and
while
the
chance
of
win
allure
her
,
the
chance
of
lose
thrust
itself
on
her
with
alternate
strength
and
make
a
vision
from
which
her
pride
sink
sensitively
.
<EOS>
for
she
be
resolve
not
to
tell
the
Langens
that
any
misfortune
have
befall
her
family
,
or
to
make
herself
in
any
way
indebted
to
their
compassion
;
and
if
she
be
to
part
with
her
jewelry
to
any
observable
extent
,
they
would
interfere
by
inquiry
and
remonstrance
.
<EOS>
the
course
that
hold
the
least
risk
of
intolerable
annoyance
be
to
raise
money
on
her
necklace
early
in
the
morning
,
tell
the
Langens
that
her
mother
desire
her
immediate
return
without
give
a
reason
,
and
take
the
train
for
Brussels
that
evening
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
maid
with
her
,
and
the
Langens
may
make
difficulty
about
her
return
home
,
but
her
will
be
peremptory
.
  
<EOS>
instead
of
go
to
bed
she
make
as
brilliant
a
light
as
she
could
and
begin
to
pack
,
work
diligently
,
though
all
the
while
visit
by
the
scene
that
may
take
place
on
the
come
day
 
now
by
the
tiresome
explanation
and
farewell
,
and
the
whirl
journey
toward
a
change
home
,
now
by
the
alternative
of
stay
just
another
day
and
stand
again
at
the
roulette
-
table
.
<EOS>
but
always
in
this
latter
scene
there
be
the
presence
of
that
Deronda
,
watch
her
with
exasperate
irony
,
and
 
the
two
keen
experience
be
inevitably
revive
together
 
behold
her
again
forsake
by
luck
.
<EOS>
this
importunate
image
certainly
help
to
sway
her
resolve
on
the
side
of
immediate
departure
,
and
to
urge
her
packing
to
the
point
which
would
make
a
change
of
mind
inconvenient
.
<EOS>
It
have
strike
twelve
when
she
come
into
her
room
,
and
by
the
time
she
be
assure
herself
that
she
have
leave
out
only
what
be
necessary
,
the
faint
dawn
be
steal
through
the
white
blind
and
dull
her
candle
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
use
of
go
to
bed
?
<EOS>
Her
cold
bath
be
refreshment
enough
,
and
she
see
that
a
slight
trace
of
fatigue
about
the
eye
only
make
her
look
the
more
interesting
.
<EOS>
before
six
o'clock
she
be
completely
equip
in
her
gray
traveling
dress
even
to
her
felt
hat
,
for
she
mean
to
walk
out
as
soon
as
she
could
count
on
see
other
lady
on
their
way
to
the
spring
.
<EOS>
and
happen
to
be
seat
sideways
before
the
long
strip
of
mirror
between
her
two
window
she
turn
to
look
at
herself
,
lean
her
elbow
on
the
back
of
the
chair
in
an
attitude
that
may
have
be
choose
for
her
portrait
.
<EOS>
It
be
possible
to
have
a
strong
self
-
love
without
any
self
-
satisfaction
,
rather
with
a
self
-
discontent
which
be
the
more
intense
because
one
's
own
little
core
of
egoistic
sensibility
be
a
supreme
care
;
but
Gwendolen
know
nothing
of
such
inward
strife
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
_
naïve
_
delight
in
her
fortunate
self
,
which
any
but
the
harsh
saintliness
will
have
some
indulgence
for
in
a
girl
who
have
every
day
see
a
pleasant
reflection
of
that
self
in
her
friend
'
flattery
as
well
as
in
the
looking
-
glass
.
<EOS>
and
even
in
this
beginning
of
trouble
,
while
for
lack
of
anything
else
to
do
she
sit
gaze
at
her
image
in
the
grow
light
,
her
face
gather
a
complacency
gradual
as
the
cheerfulness
of
the
morning
.
<EOS>
Her
beautiful
lip
curl
into
a
more
and
more
decide
smile
,
till
at
last
she
take
off
her
hat
,
lean
forward
and
kiss
the
cold
glass
which
have
look
so
warm
.
<EOS>
how
could
she
believe
in
sorrow
?
<EOS>
if
it
attack
her
,
she
feel
the
force
to
crush
it
,
to
defy
it
,
or
run
away
from
it
,
as
she
have
do
already
.
<EOS>
anything
seem
more
possible
than
that
she
could
go
on
bear
misery
,
great
or
small
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
von
Langen
never
go
out
before
breakfast
,
so
that
Gwendolen
could
safely
end
her
early
walk
by
take
her
way
homeward
through
the
Obere
Strasse
in
which
be
the
need
shop
,
sure
to
be
open
after
seven
.
<EOS>
at
that
hour
any
observer
whom
she
mind
would
be
either
on
their
walk
in
the
region
of
the
spring
,
or
would
be
still
in
their
bedroom
;
but
certainly
there
be
one
grand
hotel
,
the
_
<EOS>
Czarina
_
from
which
eye
may
follow
her
up
to
Mr.
Wiener
's
door
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
chance
to
be
risk
:
may
she
not
be
go
in
to
buy
something
which
have
strike
her
fancy
?
<EOS>
this
implicit
falsehood
pass
through
her
mind
as
she
remember
that
the
_
<EOS>
Czarina
_
be
Deronda
's
hotel
;
but
she
be
then
already
far
up
the
Obere
Strasse
,
and
she
walk
on
with
her
usual
floating
movement
,
every
line
in
her
figure
and
drapery
fall
in
gentle
curve
attractive
to
all
eye
except
those
which
discern
in
them
too
close
a
resemblance
to
the
serpent
,
and
object
to
the
revival
of
serpent
-
worship
.
<EOS>
She
look
neither
to
the
right
hand
nor
to
the
left
,
and
transact
her
business
in
the
shop
with
a
coolness
which
give
little
Mr.
Weiner
nothing
to
remark
except
her
proud
grace
of
manner
,
and
the
superior
size
and
quality
of
the
three
central
turquoise
in
the
necklace
she
offer
him
.
<EOS>
They
have
belong
to
a
chain
once
her
father
's
:
but
she
have
never
know
her
father
;
and
the
necklace
be
in
all
respect
the
ornament
she
could
most
conveniently
part
with
.
<EOS>
who
suppose
that
it
be
an
impossible
contradiction
to
be
superstitious
and
rationalize
at
the
same
time
?
<EOS>
Roulette
encourage
a
romantic
superstition
as
to
the
chance
of
the
game
,
and
the
most
prosaic
rationalism
as
to
human
sentiment
which
stand
in
the
way
of
raise
needful
money
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
dominant
regret
be
that
after
all
she
have
only
nine
louis
to
add
to
the
four
in
her
purse
:
these
Jew
dealer
be
so
unscrupulous
in
take
advantage
of
Christians
unfortunate
at
play
!
<EOS>
but
she
be
the
Langens
'
guest
in
their
hire
apartment
,
and
have
nothing
to
pay
there
:
thirteen
louis
would
do
more
than
take
her
home
;
even
if
she
determine
on
risk
three
,
the
remain
ten
would
more
than
suffice
,
since
she
mean
to
travel
right
on
,
day
and
night
.
<EOS>
as
she
turn
homeward
,
nay
,
enter
and
seat
herself
in
the
_
salon
_
to
await
her
friend
and
breakfast
,
she
still
waver
as
to
her
immediate
departure
,
or
<EOS>
rather
she
have
conclude
to
tell
the
Langens
simply
that
she
have
have
a
letter
from
her
mamma
desire
her
return
,
and
to
leave
it
still
undecided
when
she
should
start
.
<EOS>
It
be
already
the
usual
breakfast
-
time
,
and
hear
some
one
enter
as
she
be
lean
back
rather
tired
and
hungry
with
her
eye
<EOS>
shut
,
she
rise
expect
to
see
one
or
other
of
the
Langens
 
<EOS>
the
word
which
may
determine
her
lingering
at
least
another
day
,
ready
-
form
to
pass
her
lip
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
the
servant
bring
in
a
small
packet
for
Miss
Harleth
,
which
have
at
that
moment
be
leave
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
take
it
in
her
hand
and
immediately
hurry
into
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
She
look
paler
and
more
agitated
than
when
she
have
first
read
her
mamma
's
letter
.
<EOS>
something
 
<EOS>
she
never
quite
know
what
 
reveal
to
her
before
she
open
the
packet
that
it
contain
the
necklace
she
have
just
part
with
.
<EOS>
underneath
the
paper
it
be
wrap
in
a
cambric
handkerchief
,
and
within
this
be
a
scrap
of
tear
-
off
note
-
paper
,
on
which
be
write
with
a
pencil
,
in
clear
but
rapid
handwriting
 
"
_
a
stranger
who
have
find
Miss
Harleth
's
necklace
return
it
to
her
with
the
hope
that
she
will
not
again
risk
the
loss
of
it
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
  
Gwendolen
redden
with
the
vexation
of
wounded
pride
.
<EOS>
a
large
corner
of
the
handkerchief
seem
to
have
be
recklessly
tear
off
to
get
rid
of
a
mark
;
but
she
at
once
believe
in
the
first
image
of
"
the
stranger
"
that
present
itself
to
her
mind
.
<EOS>
It
be
Deronda
;
he
must
have
see
her
go
into
the
shop
;
he
must
have
go
in
immediately
after
and
repurchase
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
He
have
take
an
unpardonable
liberty
,
and
have
dare
to
place
her
in
a
thoroughly
hateful
position
.
<EOS>
what
could
she
do
?
 
<EOS>
not
,
assuredly
,
act
on
her
conviction
that
it
be
he
who
have
send
her
the
necklace
and
straightway
<EOS>
send
it
back
to
him
<EOS>
:
that
would
be
to
face
the
possibility
that
she
have
be
mistake
;
nay
,
even
if
the
"
stranger
"
be
he
and
no
other
,
it
would
be
something
too
gross
for
her
to
let
him
know
that
she
have
divine
this
,
and
to
meet
him
again
with
that
recognition
in
their
mind
.
<EOS>
He
know
very
well
that
he
be
entangle
her
in
helpless
humiliation
:
it
be
another
way
of
smile
at
her
ironically
,
and
take
the
air
of
a
supercilious
mentor
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
feel
the
bitter
tear
of
mortification
rise
and
roll
down
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
no
one
have
ever
before
dare
to
treat
her
with
irony
and
contempt
.
<EOS>
one
thing
be
clear
:
she
must
carry
out
her
resolution
to
quit
this
place
at
once
;
it
be
impossible
for
her
to
reappear
in
the
public
_
salon
_
,
still
less
stand
at
the
gaming
-
table
with
the
risk
of
see
Deronda
.
<EOS>
now
come
an
importunate
knock
at
the
door
:
breakfast
be
ready
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
with
a
passionate
movement
thrust
necklace
,
cambric
,
scrap
of
paper
,
and
all
into
her
_
nécessaire
_
,
press
her
handkerchief
against
her
face
,
and
after
pause
a
minute
or
two
to
summon
back
her
proud
self
-
control
,
go
to
join
her
friend
.
<EOS>
such
sign
of
tear
and
fatigue
as
be
leave
seem
accordant
enough
with
the
account
she
at
once
give
of
her
have
sit
up
to
do
her
packing
,
instead
of
wait
for
help
from
her
friend
's
maid
.
<EOS>
there
be
much
protestation
,
as
she
have
expect
,
against
her
travel
alone
,
but
she
persist
in
refuse
any
arrangement
for
companionship
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
put
into
the
lady
'
compartment
and
go
right
on
.
<EOS>
She
could
rest
exceedingly
well
in
the
train
,
and
be
afraid
of
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
way
it
happen
that
Gwendolen
never
reappear
at
the
roulette
-
table
,
but
that
Thursday
evening
leave
Leubronn
for
Brussels
,
and
on
Saturday
morning
arrive
at
Offendene
,
the
home
to
which
she
and
her

be
soon
to
say
a
last
good

<EOS>
a
human
life

I
think
,
should

well
root
in
some
spot
of
a

where
it
may
get
the
love
of
tender

for

for
the
labor
man
go
forth
to
,
for
the

that
haunt

,
for
whatever
will
give
that
early
home
a
familiar
unmistakable
difference
amid
the
future
widening
of
knowledge
:
a
spot
where
the
definiteness
of

may
be
inwrought
with
affection
,
and
 
kindly
acquaintance
with
all
neighbor
,
even
to
the
dog
and
donkey
,
may
spread
not
by
sentimental
effort
and
reflection
,
but
as
a
sweet
habit
of
the
blood
.
<EOS>
at
five
year
old
,
mortal
be
not
prepared
to
be
citizen
of
the
world
,
to
be
stimulate
by
abstract
noun
,
to
soar
above
preference
into
impartiality
;
and
that
prejudice
in
favor
of
milk
with
which
we
blindly

be
a
type
of
the
way
body

must
get

for

<EOS>
the
good
introduction
to
astronomy
be
to
think
of
the
nightly

as
a
little
lot
of

belong
to
one
's
own

.
  
<EOS>
but
this
bless
persistence
in
which
affection
can
take
root
have
be
want
in
Gwendolen
's
life
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
a
year
before
her
recall
from
Leubronn
that
Offendene
have
be
choose
as
her
mamma
's
home
,
simply
for
its
nearness
to
Pennicote
Rectory
,
and

Gwendolen

and

four

have
be
drive
along
the

for
the
first
time
,
on
a
late
October
afternoon
when
the
rook
be
crawe
loudly
above
them
,
and
the
yellow
elm
-
leave
be
whirl
.
  
<EOS>
the
season
suit
the
aspect
of
the
old
oblong
red

brick
house
,
rather
too
anxiously
ornament
with
stone
at
every
line
,
not
except
the
double
row
of
narrow
window
and
the
large
square
portico
.
<EOS>
the
stone
encourage
a
greenish
lichen
,
the
brick
a
powdery
gray
,
so
that
though
the
building
be
rigidly
rectangular
there
be
no
harshness
in
the
physiognomy
which
it
turn
to
the

<EOS>
one
would
have
like
the

to
have
be
lift
on
a

,
so
as
to
look
beyond
its

little
domain
to
the
long

roof
of
the
distant

the

,
the

,
the

the

of

though
stand
thus

it

just
large
enough
to
be
call
a
mansion

and
be
moderately
rent

have
no
manor
attach
to
it
,
and
be
rather
difficult

with
its
sombre
furniture

<EOS>
but
inside

outside
it
be
what
no

to

retire
trade

people
:
a

not
only
have
the
taste
that
shrink
from
new
finery

but
also
be
in
that
border

territory

for
dowager

give
a
perceptible
tinge
to
Mrs.

's
satisfaction
in
have
an
establishment
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
this
,
rather
mysteriously
to
Gwendolen
,
appear
suddenly
possible
on
the
death
of
her
step
-
father
,
Captain
Davilow
,
who
have
for
the
last
nine
year
join
his
family
only
in
a
brief
and
fitful
manner
,
enough
to
reconcile
them
to
his
long
absence
;
but
she
care
much
more
for
the
fact
than
for
the
explanation
.
<EOS>
all
her
prospect
have
become
more
agreeable
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
She
have
dislike
their
former
way
of
life
,
rove
from
one
foreign
watering
-
place
or
parisian
apartment
to
another
,
always
feel
new
antipathy
to
new
suite
of
hire
furniture
,
and
meet
new
people
under
condition
which
make
her
appear
of
little
importance
;
and
the
variation
of
have
pass
two
year
at
a
showy
school
,
where
,
on
all
occasion
of
display
,
she
have
be
put
foremost
,
have
only
deepen
her
sense
that
so
exceptional
a
person
as
herself
could
hardly
remain
in
ordinary
circumstance
or
in
a
social
position
less
than
advantageous
.
<EOS>
any
fear
of
this
latter
evil
be
banish
now
that
her
mamma
be
to
have
an
establishment
;
for
on
the
point
of
birth
Gwendolen
be
quite
easy
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
notion
how
her
maternal
grandfather
get
the
fortune
inherit
by
his
two
daughter
;
but
he
have
be
a
West
indian
 
which
seem
to
exclude
further
question
;
and
she
know
that
her
father
's
family
be
so
high
as
to
take
no
notice
of
her
mamma
,
who
nevertheless
preserve
with
much
pride
the
miniature
of
a
Lady
Molly
in
that
connection
.
<EOS>
She
would
probably
have
know
much
more
about
her
father
but
for
a
little
incident
which
happen
when
she
be
twelve
year
old
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
have
bring
out
,
as
she
do
only
at
wide
interval
,
various
memorial
of
her
first
husband
,
and
while
show
his
miniature
to
Gwendolen
recall
with
a
fervor
which
seem
to
count
on
a
peculiar
filial
sympathy
,
the
fact
that
dear
papa
have
die
when
his
little
daughter
be
in
long
clothe
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
immediately
think
of
the
unlovable
step
-
father
whom
she
have
be
acquaint
with
the
great
part
of
her
life
while
her
frock
be
short
,
say
    
"
why
do
you
marry
again
,
mamma
?
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
nice
if
you
have
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
color
deeply
,
a
slight
convulsive
movement
pass
over
her
face
,
and
straightway
shut
up
the
memorial
she
say
,
with
a
violence
quite
unusual
in
her
    
"
You
have
no
feeling
,
child
!
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
who
be
fond
of
her
mamma
,
feel
hurt
and
ashamed
,
and
have
never
since
dare
to
ask
a
question
about
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
not
the
only
instance
in
which
she
have
bring
on
herself
the
pain
of
some
filial
compunction
.
<EOS>
It
be
always
arrange
,
when
possible
,
that
she
should
have
a
small
bed
in
her
mamma
's
room
;
for
Mrs.
Davilow
's
motherly
tenderness
clung
chiefly
to
her
eld
girl
,
who
have
be
bear
in
her
happy
time
.
<EOS>
one
night
under
an
attack
of
pain
she
find
that
the
specific
regularly
place
by
her
bedside
have
be
forget
,
and
beg
Gwendolen
to
get
out
of
bed
and
reach
it
for
her
.
<EOS>
that
healthy
young
lady
,
snug
and
warm
as
a
rosy
infant
in
her
little
couch
,
object
to
step
out
into
the
cold
,
and
lie
perfectly
still
,
grumble
a
refusal
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
go
without
the
medicine
and
never
reproach
her
daughter
;
but
the
next
day
Gwendolen
be
keenly
conscious
of
what
must
be
in
her
mamma
's
mind
,
and
try
to
make
amend
by
caress
which
cost
her
no
effort
.
<EOS>
have
always
be
the
pet
and
pride
of
the
household
,
wait
on
by
mother
,
sister
,
governess
and
maid
,
as
if
she
have
be
a
princess
in
exile
,
she
naturally
find
it
difficult
to
think
her
own
pleasure
less
important
than
other
make
it
,
and
when
it
be
positively
thwart
feel
an
astonished
resentment
apt
,
in
her
cruder
day
,
to
vent
itself
in
one
of
those
passionate
act
which
look
like
a
contradiction
of
habitual
tendency
.
<EOS>
though
never
even
as
a
child
thoughtlessly
cruel
,
nay
delight
to
rescue
drown
insect
and
watch
their
recovery
,
there
be
a
disagreeable
silent
remembrance
of
her
have
strangle
her
sister
's
canary
-
bird
in
a
final
fit
of
exasperation
at
its
shrill
singing
which
have
again
and
again
jarringly
interrupt
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
have
take
pain
to
buy
a
white
mouse
for
her
sister
in
retribution
,
and
though
inwardly
excuse
herself
on
the
ground
of
a
peculiar
sensitiveness
which
be
a
mark
of
her
general
superiority
,
the
thought
of
that
infelonious
murder
have
always
make
her
wince
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
nature
be
not
remorseless
,
but
she
like
to
make
her
penance
easy
,
and
now
that
she
be
twenty
and
more
,
some
of
her
native
force
have
turn
into
a
self
-
control
by
which
she
guard
herself
from
penitential
humiliation
.
<EOS>
there
be
more
show
of
fire
and
will
in
her
than
ever
,
but
there
be
more
calculation
underneath
it
.
  
<EOS>
on
this
day
of
arrival
at
Offendene
,
which
not
even
Mrs.
Davilow
have
see
before
 
the
place
have
be
take
for
her
by
her
brother
-
in

,
Mr.
Gascoigne
 
when
all
have
get
down
from
the
carriage
,
and
be
stand
under
the
porch
in
front
of
the
open
door
,
so
that
they
could
have
a
general
view
of
the
place
and
a
glimpse
of
the
stone
hall
and
staircase
hang
with
sombre
picture
,
but
enliven
by
a
bright
wood
fire
,
no
one
speak
;
<EOS>
mamma
,
the
four
sister
and
the
governess
all
look
at
Gwendolen
,
as
if
their
feeling
depend
entirely
on
her
decision
.
<EOS>
of
the
girl
,
from
Alice
in
her
sixteenth
year
to
Isabel
in
her
tenth
,
hardly
anything
could
be
say
on
a
first
view
,
but
that
they
be
girlish
,
and
that
their
black
dress
be
get
shabby
.
<EOS>
Miss
Merry
be
elderly
and
altogether
neutral
in
expression
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
's
wear
beauty
seem
the
more
pathetic
for
the
look
of
entire
appeal
which
she
cast
at
Gwendolen
,
who
be
glance
round
at
the
house
,
the
landscape
and
the
entrance
hall
with
an
air
of
rapid
judgment
.
<EOS>
imagine
a
young
race

horse
in
the
paddock
among
untrimmed
pony
and
patient
hack
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,

what

you
think
of
the
place
,
"
say
Mrs.
Davilow
at
last
,
in

deprecatory
tone

"
I

Gwendolen

quickly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
romantic
place

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there

nothing

it

We

come
down
to
this

<EOS>
It
would
have
be
as
romantic
as
could
be

<EOS>
but
I
think
my
uncle

Gascoigne
would
be
here
to
meet
us

Gwendolen

I

<EOS>
I
could
wish
some

well
for

this
satisfied
Gwendolen

to

indifference

You

I
wish
you

me
your

straight

a
nose

mine

Can

up

yes

She

the

do

me
,
Gwendolen

<EOS>
You
know
,
you
can
not

be
equal
to
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
her
to
be
equal
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
with
a
toss
of
her
head
and
a
smile
,
and
the
discussion
end
there
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gascoigne
and
their
daughter
come
,
Gwendolen
,
far
from
be
scornful
,
behave
as
prettily
as
possible
to
them
.
<EOS>
She
be
introduce
herself
anew
to
relative
who
have
not
see
her
since
the
comparatively
unfinished
age
of
sixteen
,
and
she
be
anxious
 
<EOS>
no
,
not
anxious
,
but
resolve
that
they
should
admire
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Gascoigne
bear
a
family
likeness
to
her
sister
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
dark
and
slighter
,
her
face
be
unworn
by
grief
,
her
movement
be
less
languid
,
her
expression
more
alert
and
critical
as
that
of
a
rector
's
wife
bind
to
exert
a
beneficent
authority
.
<EOS>
Their
close
resemblance
lie
in
a
non
-
resistant
disposition
,
incline
to
imitation
and
obedience
;
but
this
,
owe
to
the
difference
in
their
circumstance
,
have
lead
them
to
very
different
issue
.
<EOS>
the
young
sister
have
be
indiscreet
,
or
at
least
unfortunate
in
her
marriage
;
the
elder
believe
herself
the
most
enviable
of
wife
,
and
her
pliancy
have
end
in
her
sometimes
take
shape
of
surprising
definiteness
.
<EOS>
many
of
her
opinion
,
such
as
those
on
church
government
and
the
character
of
Archbishop
Laud
,
seem
too
decide
under
every
alteration
to
have
be
arrive
at
otherwise
than
by
a
wifely
receptiveness
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
much
to
encourage
trust
in
her
husband
's
authority
.
<EOS>
He
have
some
agreeable
virtue
,
some
striking
advantage
,
and
the
failing
that
be
impute
to
him
all
lean
toward
the
side
of
success
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
his
advantage
be
a
fine
person
,
which
perhaps
be
even
more
impressive
at
fifty
-
seven
than
it
have
be
earlier
in
life
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
distinctively
clerical
line
in
the
face
,
no
trick
of
starchiness
or
of
affected
ease
:
in
his
Inverness
cape
he
could
not
have
be
identify
except
as
a
gentleman
with
handsome
dark
feature
,
a
nose
which
begin
with
an
intention
to
be
aquiline
but
suddenly
become
straight
,
and
iron
-
gray
,
hair
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
owe
this
freedom
from
the
sort
of
professional
make
-
up
which
penetrate
skin
,
tone
and
gesture
and
defy
all
drapery
,
to
the
fact
that
he
have
once
be
Captain
Gaskin
,
have
take
order
and
a
diphthong
but
shortly
before
his
engagement
to
Miss
Armyn
.
<EOS>
if
any
one
have
object
that
his
preparation
for
the
clerical
function
be
inadequate
,
his
friend
may
have
ask
who
make
a
well
figure
in
it
,
who
preach
better
or
have
more
authority
in
his
parish
?
<EOS>
He
have
a
native
gift
for
administration
,
be
tolerant
both
of
opinion
and
conduct
,
because
he
feel
himself
able
to
overrule
them
,
and
be
free
from
the
irritation
of
conscious
feebleness
.
<EOS>
He
smile
pleasantly
at
the
foible
of
a
taste
which
he
do
not
share
 
at
floriculture
or
antiquarianism
for
example
,
which
be
much
in
vogue
among
his
fellow
-
clergyman
in
the
diocese
:
for
himself
,
he
prefer
follow
the
history
of
a
campaign
,
or
divine
from
his
knowledge
of
Nesselrode
's
motive
what
would
have
be
his
conduct
if
our
cabinet
have
take
a
different
course
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
's
tone
of
thinking
after
some
long
-
quieted
fluctuation
have
become
ecclesiastical
rather
than
theological
;
not
the
modern
Anglican
,
but
what
he
would
have
call
sound
English
,
free
from
nonsense
;
such
as
become
a
man
who
look
at
a
national
religion
by
daylight
,
and
see
it
in
its
relation
to
other
thing
.
<EOS>
no
clerical
magistrate
have
great
weight
at
session
,
or
less
of
mischievous
impracticableness
in
relation
to
worldly
affair
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
bad
imputation
throw
out
against
him
<EOS>
be
worldliness
<EOS>
:
it
could
not
be
prove
that
he
forsake
the
less
fortunate
,
but
it
be
not
to
be
deny
that
the
friendship
he
cultivate
be
of
a
kind
likely
to
be
useful
to
the
father
of
six
son
and
two
daughter
;
and
bitter
observer
 
for
in
Wessex
,
say
<EOS>
ten
year
ago
,
there
be
person
whose
bitterness
may
now
seem
incredible
 
remark
that
the
color
of
his
opinion
have
change
in
consistency
with
this
principle
of
action
.
<EOS>
but
cheerful
,
successful
worldliness
have
a
false
air
of
be
more
selfish
than
the
acrid
,
unsuccessful
kind
,
whose
secret
history
be
sum
up
in
the
terrible
word
,
"
sell
,
but
not
pay
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
wonder
that
she
have
not
better
remember
how
very
fine
a
man
her
uncle
be
;
but
at
the
age
of
sixteen
she
be
a
less
capable
and
more
indifferent
judge
.
<EOS>
at
present
it
be
a
matter
of
extreme
interest
to
her
that
she
be
to
have
the
near
countenance
of
a
dignified
male
relative
,
and
that
the
family
life
would
cease
to
be
entirely
,
insipidly
feminine
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
intend
that
her
uncle
should
control
her
,
but
she
see
at
once
that
it
would
be
altogether
agreeable
to
her
that
he
should
be
proud
of
introduce
her
as
his
niece
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
every
sign
of
his
be
likely
to
feel
that
pride
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
look
at
her
with
admiration
as
he
say
    
"
You
have
outgrow
Anna
,
my
dear
,
"
put
his
arm
tenderly
round
his
daughter
,
whose
shy
face
be
a
tiny
copy
of
his
own
,
and
draw
her
forward
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
be
not
so
old
as
you
by
a
year
,
but
her
grow
day
be
certainly
over
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
be
excellent
companion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
do
give
a
compare
glance
at
his
daughter
,
but
if
he
see
her
inferiority
,
he
may
also
see
that
Anna
's
timid
appearance
and
miniature
figure
must
appeal
to
a
different
taste
from
that
which
be
attract
by
Gwendolen
,
and
that
the
girl
could
hardly
be
rival
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
at
least
,
be
aware
of
this
,
and
kiss
her
cousin
with
real
cordiality
as
well
as
grace
,
say
,
"
a
companion
be
just
what
I
want
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
glad
we
be
come
to
live
here
.
<EOS>
and
mamma
will
be
much
happy
<EOS>
now
she
be
near
you
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
aunt
trust
indeed
that
it
would
be
so
,
and
feel
it
a
blessing
that
a
suitable
home
have
be
vacant
in
their
uncle
's
parish
.
<EOS>
then
,
of
course
,
notice
have
to
be
take
of
the
four
other
girl
,
whom
Gwendolen
have
always
feel
to
be
superfluous
:
all
of
a
girlish
average
that
make
four
unit
utterly
unimportant
,
and
yet
from
her
early
day
an
obtrusive
influential
fact
in
her
life
.
<EOS>
She
be
conscious
of
have
be
much
kind
to
them
than
could
have
be
expect
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
evident
to
her
that
her
uncle
and
aunt
also
feel
it
a
pity
there
be
so
many
girl
:
 
what
rational
person
could
feel
otherwise
,
except
poor
mamma
,
who
never
would
see
how
Alice
set
up
her
shoulder
and
lift
her
eyebrow
till
she
have
no
forehead
leave
,
how
Bertha
and
Fanny
whisper
and
titter
together
about
everything
,
or
how
Isabel
be
always
listen
and
stare
and
forget
where
she
be
,
and
tread
on
the
toe
of
her
suffering
elder
?
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
brother
,
Anna
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
while
the
sister
be
be
notice
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
be
enviable
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Anna
,
simply
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
fond
of
them
;
but
of
course
their
education
be
a
great
anxiety
to
papa

<EOS>
He
use
to
say
they
make
me
a
tomboy

I
really
be
a
great
romp
with
Rex

I
think
you
will
like

He
will
come
home
before
Christmas

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
I
use
to
think
you
rather
wild
and
shy
;
but
it
be
difficult
now
to
imagine
you
a
romp
,

say
Gwendolen
,
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
I
be
alter
now
;
I
be
come
out
,
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
but
in
reality
I
like
to
go
blackberry
with
Edwy
and
Lotta
as
well
as
ever
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
very
fond
of
go
out

but
I
dare
say
I
shall
like
it
better
<EOS>
now
you
will
be
often
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
at
all
clever
,
and
I
never
know
what
to
say
.
<EOS>
It
seem
so
useless
to
say
what
everybody
know

and
I
can
think
of
nothing
else
,
except
what
papa
say

<EOS>
"
  
"
I
shall
like
go
out

very

Gwendolen

well
disposed

be
you
fond

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes

we

Papa

Mr.

in

you
need
give
no
expensive
dinner

<EOS>
of
course
,
I
have
to
spend
a
good
deal
in
that
way

it
be
a
large
item

then
I
get
my
house

I

three
hundred

I

You

It

I

<EOS>
"
Our
Anna
,
poor
child

be
too
short

sighed
for
archery

<EOS>
but
I
consider
myself
a
first

rate
shot

and
you
shall
practice
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
must
make
you
an
accomplish
archer
before
our
great
meeting
in
July
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
as
to
neighborhood
,
you
could
hardly
be
better
place
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
Arrowpoints
 
<EOS>
they
be
some
of
our
good
people

<EOS>
Miss
Arrowpoint
be
a
delightful
girl

she

present
at
Court

They

the
good
thing
of
the
sort
we
have

<EOS>
the
archdeacon

intimate
there
,

they
have
always
a
good
kind
of
people
stay
in
the
house

<EOS>
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
be
peculiar
,
certainly
;
something
of
a
caricature
,
in
fact

but
well
-
meaning

<EOS>
and
Miss
Arrowpoint

nice

Mrs.

faintly
at
this
little
compliment

the
husband

look
affectionately
at

Gwendolen

,
"
My
uncle

aunt
,
at

,
be
happy
:
they
be
not
dull

dismal

"
<EOS>
altogether
,
she
feel
satisfied
with
her
prospect
at
Offendene

as
a
great
improvement
on
anything
she

<EOS>
even
the
cheap
curate

she
incidentally
learn
,
be
almost
always
young
man
of
family
,
and
Mr.
Middleton
,
the
actual
curate
,
be
say
to
be
quite
an
acquisition
:
it
be
only
a
pity
<EOS>
he
be
so
soon
to
leave
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
one
point
which
she
be
so
anxious
to
gain
that
she
could
not
allow
the
evening
to
pass
without
take
her
measure
toward
secure
it
.
<EOS>
Her
mamma
,
she
know
,
intend
to
submit
entirely
to
her
uncle
's
judgment
with
regard
to
expenditure
;
and
the
submission
be
not
merely
prudential
,
for
Mrs.
Davilow
,
conscious
that
she
have
always
be
see
under
a
cloud
as
poor
dear
Fanny
,
who
have
make
a
sad
blunder
with
her
second
marriage
,
feel
a
hearty
satisfaction
in
be
frankly
and
cordially
identify
with
her
sister
's
family
,
and
in
have
her
affair
canvass
and
manage
with
an
authority
which
presuppose
a
genuine
interest
.
<EOS>
thus
the
question
of
a
suitable
saddle
-
horse
,
which
have
be
sufficiently
discuss
with
mamma
,
have
to
be
refer
to
Mr.
Gascoigne
;
and
after
Gwendolen
have
play
on
the
piano
,
which
have
be
provide
from
Wanchester
,
have
sing
to
her
hearer
'
admiration
,
and
have
induce
her
uncle
to
join
her
in
a
duet
 
what
more
softening
influence
than
this
on
any
uncle
who
would
have
sing
finely
if
his
time
have
not
be
too
much
take
up
by
graver
matter

<EOS>
she
seize
the
opportune
moment
for
say
,
"

I
feel

you
be
almost

indulgent

She
ought
not

claim
so
much
more
than
your

would
think

especially
before
we
see
how
Fanny
manage
on

you
really
have
enough
to
do
without

"
My
dear
Nancy
,
one
must
look
at
thing
from
every
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
this
girl
be
really
worth
some
expense
:
you
do
not
often
see
her
equal
.
<EOS>
She
ought
to
make
a
first
-
rate
marriage
,
and
I
should
not
be
do
my
duty
if
I
spare
my
trouble
in
help
her
forward

<EOS>
You
know
yourself
she
have
be
under
a
disadvantage
with
such
a
father
-
in
-
law
,
and
a
second
family
,
keep
her
always
in
the
shade
.
<EOS>
I
feel
for
the
girl
,
and
I
should
like
your
sister
and
her
family
now
to
have
the
benefit
of
your
have
marry
rather
a
well
speciman
of
our
kind
than
she
do

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
rather
better
!
<EOS>
I
should
think
so
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
for
me
to
be
grateful
that
you
will
take
so
much
on
your
shoulder
for
the
sake
of
my
sister
and
her
child
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
would
not
grudge
anything
to
poor
Fanny
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
one
thing
I
have
be
think
of
,
though
you
have
never
mention
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
?

<EOS>
the
boy

<EOS>
I
hope
they
will
not

fall
in
love

do
not

anything
of

my

there
will
be
no
danger

Rex
will
never

Warham

It

the
wise
plan
to
take
it
for
grant
that
cousin
will
not
fall
in
love

<EOS>
if
you
begin
with
precaution
,
the
affair
will
come
in

of
them

<EOS>
one
must
not
undertake
to
act
for
Providence
in
these

can
no

hold
under

<EOS>
the
boy
will
have
nothing

Gwendolen
will
have
nothing

<EOS>
They
can
not

<EOS>
at
the
bad
there
would
only
be
a

you
can
not

<EOS>
Mrs.

's
mind
be
satisfied

if
anything
do
happen

there
be
the
comfort

feeling

energy

do

It
would
be
a
little
hard
to
blame
the
rector
of
Pennicote
that
in
the
course
of
look
at
thing
from
every
point
of
view
,
he
look
at
Gwendolen
as
a
girl
likely
to
make
a
brilliant
marriage
.
<EOS>
why
should
he
be
expect
to
differ
from
his
contemporary
in
this
matter
,
and
wish
his
niece
a
bad
end
of
her
charming
maidenhood
than
they
would
approve
as
the
good
possible
?
<EOS>
It
be
rather
to
be
set
down
to
his
credit
that
his
feeling
on
the
subject
be
entirely
good
-
natured
.
<EOS>
and
in
consider
the
relation
of
mean
to
end
,
it
would
have
be
mere
folly
to
have
be
guide
by
the
exceptional
and
idyllic
 
to
have
recommend
that
Gwendolen
should
wear
a
gown
as
shabby
as
Griselda
's
in
order
that
a
marquis
may
fall
in
love
with
her
,
or
to
have
insist
that
since
a
fair
maiden
be
to
be
seek
,
she
should
keep
herself
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
's
calculation
be
of
the
kind
call
rational
,
and
he
do
not
even
think
of
get
a
too
frisky
horse
in
order
that
Gwendolen
may
be
threaten
with
an
accident
and
be
rescue
by
a
man
of
property
.
<EOS>
He
wish
his
niece
well
,
and
he
mean
her
to
be
see
to
advantage
in
the
good
society
of
the
neighborhood
.
  
<EOS>
Her
uncle
's
intention
fall
in
perfectly
with
Gwendolen
's
own
wish
.
<EOS>
but
let
no
one
suppose
that
she
also
contemplate
a
brilliant
marriage
as
the
direct
end
of
her
witch
the
world
with
her
grace
on
horseback
,
or
with
any
other
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
that
she
be
to
be
marry
<EOS>
some
time
or
other
she
would
have
feel
oblige
to
admit
;
and
that
her
marriage
would
not
be
of
a
middling
kind
,
such
as
most
girl
be
content
with
<EOS>
,
she
feel
quietly
,
unargumentatively
sure
.
<EOS>
but
her
thought
never
dwelt
on
marriage
as
the
fulfillment
of
her
ambition
;
the
drama
in
which
she
imagine
herself
a
heroine
be
not
work
up
to
that
close
.
<EOS>
to
be
very
much
sue
or
hopelessly
sighed
for
as
a
bride
be
indeed
an
indispensable
and
agreeable
guarantee
of
womanly
power
;
but
to
become
a
wife
and
wear
all
the
domestic
fetter
of
that
condition
,
be
on
the
whole
a
vexatious
necessity
.
<EOS>
Her
observation
of
matrimony
have
incline
her
to
think
it
rather
a
dreary
state
in
which
a
woman
could
not
do
what
she
like
,
have
more
child
than
be
desirable
,
be
consequently
dull
,
and
become
irrevocably
immerse
in
humdrum
.
<EOS>
of
course
marriage
be
social
promotion
;
she
could
not
look
forward
to
a
single
life
;
but
promotion
have
sometimes
to
be
take
with
bitter
herb
 
a
peerage
will
not
quite
do
instead
of
leadership
to
the
man
who
mean
to
lead
;
and
this
delicate
-
limbed
sylph
of
twenty
mean
to
lead
.
<EOS>
for
such
passion
dwell
in
feminine
breast
also
.
<EOS>
in
Gwendolen
's
,
however
,
they
dwelt
among
strictly
feminine
furniture
,
and
have
no
disturb
reference
to
the
advancement
of
learning
or
the
balance
of
the
constitution
;
her
knowledge
be
such
as
with
no
sort
of
standing
-
room
or
length
of
lever
could
have
be
expect
to
move
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
mean
to
do
what
be
pleasant
to
herself
in
a
striking
manner
;
or
rather
,
whatever
she
could
do
so
as
to
strike
other
with
admiration
and
get
in
that
reflect
way
a
more
ardent
sense
of
living
,
seem
pleasant
to
her
fancy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gwendolen
will
not
rest
without
have
the
world
at
her
foot
,
"
say
Miss
Merry
,
the
meek
governess
:
hyperbolical
word
which
have
long
come
to
carry
the
most
moderate
meaning
;
for
who
have
not
hear
of
private
person
have
the
world
at
their
foot
in
the
shape
of
some
half
-
dozen
item
of
flattering
regard
generally
know
in
a
genteel
suburb
?
<EOS>
and
word
could
hardly
be
too
wide
or
vague
to
indicate
the
prospect
that
make
a
hazy
largeness
about
poor
Gwendolen
on
the
height
of
her
young
self
-
exultation
.
<EOS>
other
people
allow
themselves
to
be
make
slave
of
,
and
to
have
their
life
blow
hither
and
thither
like
empty
ship
in
which
no
will
be
present
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
so
with
her
;
she
would
no
longer
be
sacrifice
to
creature
worth
less
than
herself
,
but
would
make
the
very
good
of
the
chance
that
life
offer
her
,
and
conquer
circumstance
by
her
exceptional
cleverness
.
<EOS>
certainly
,
to
be
settle
at
Offendene
,
with
the
notice
of
Lady
Brackenshaw
,
the
archery
club
,
and
invitation
to
dine
with
the
Arrowpoints
,
as
the
high
light
in
her
scenery
,
be
not
a
position
that
seem
to
offer
remarkable
chance
;
but
Gwendolen
's
confidence
lie
chiefly
in
herself
.
<EOS>
She
feel
well
equipped
for
the
mastery
of
life
.
<EOS>
with
regard
to
much
in
her
lot
hitherto
,
she
hold
herself
rather
hardly
deal
with
,
but
as
to
her
"
education
,
"
she
would
have
admit
that
it
have
leave
her
under
no
disadvantage
.
<EOS>
in
the
school
-
room
her
quick
mind
have
take
readily
that
strong
starch
of
unexplained
rule
and
disconnected
fact
which
save
ignorance
from
any
painful
sense
of
limpness
;
and
what
remain
of
all
thing
knowable
,
she
be
conscious
of
be
sufficiently
acquaint
with
through
novel
,
play
and
poem
.
<EOS>
about
her
French
and
music
,
the
two
justify
accomplishment
of
a
young
lady
,
she
feel
no
ground
for
uneasiness
;
and
when
to
all
these
qualification
,
negative
and
positive
,
we
add
the
spontaneous
sense
of
capability
some
happy
person
be
bear
with
,
so
that
any
subject
they
turn
their
attention
to
impress
them
with
their
own
power
of
form
a
correct
judgment
on
it
,
who
can
wonder
if
Gwendolen
feel
ready
to
manage
her
own
destiny
?
  
<EOS>
there
be
many
subject
in
the
world
 
<EOS>
perhaps
the
majority
 
in
which
she
feel
no
interest
,
because
they
be
stupid
;
for
subject
be
apt
to
appear
stupid
to
the
young
as
light
seem
dull
to
the
old
;
but
she
would
not
have
feel
at
all
helpless
in
relation
to
them
if
they
have
turn
up
in
conversation
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
remember
that
no
one
have
dispute
her
power
or
her
general
superiority
.
<EOS>
as
on
the
arrival
at
Offendene
,
so
always
,
the
first
thought
of
those
about
her
have
be
,
what
will
Gwendolen
think
?
 
<EOS>
if
the
footman
tread
heavily
in
creak
boot
,
or
if
the
laundress
's
work
be
unsatisfactory
,
the
maid
say
,
"
this
will
never
do
for
Miss
Harleth
"
;
if
the
wood
smoke
in
the
bedroom
fireplace
,
Mrs.
Davilow
,
whose
own
weak
eye
suffer
much
from
this
inconvenience
,
speak
apologetically
of
it
to
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
if
,
when
they
be
under
the
stress
of
traveling
,
she
do
not
appear
at
the
breakfast
table
till
every
one
else
have
finish
,
the
only
question
be
,
how
Gwendolen
's
coffee
and
toast
should
still
be
of
the
hot
and
crisp
;
and
when
she
appear
with
her
freshly
-
brush
light
-
brown
hair
stream
backward
and
await
her
mamma
's
hand
to
coil
it
up
,
her
large
brown
eye
glance
bright
as
a
wave
-
washed
onyx
from
under
their
long
lash
,
it
be
always
she
herself
who
have
to
be
tolerant
 
to
beg
that
Alice
who
sit
wait
on
her
would
not
stick
up
her
shoulder
in
that
frightful
manner
,
and
that
Isabel
,
instead
of
push
up
to
her
and
ask
question
,
would
go
away
to
Miss
Merry
.
  
<EOS>
always
she
be
the
princess
in
exile
,
who
in
time
of
famine
be
to
have
her
breakfast
-
roll
make
of
the
finest
-
bolt
flour
from
the
seven
thin
ear
of
wheat
,
and
in
a
general
decampment
be
to
have
her
silver
fork
keep
out
of
the
baggage
.
<EOS>
how
be
this
to
be
account
for
?
<EOS>
the
answer
may
seem
to
lie
quite
on
the
surface
:
 
in
her
beauty
,
a
certain
unusualness
about
her
,
a
decision
of
will
which
make
itself
feel
in
her
graceful
movement
and
clear
unhesitate
tone
,
so
that
if
she
come
into
the
room
on
a
rainy
day
when
everybody
else
be
flaccid
and
the
use
of
thing
in
general
be
not
apparent
to
them
,
there
seem
to
be
a
sudden
,
sufficient
reason
for
keep
up
the
form
of
life
;
and
even
the
waiter
at
hotel
show
the
more
alacrity
in
do
away
with
crumb
and
crease
and
dreg
with
struggle
fly
in
them
.
<EOS>
this
potent
charm
,
add
to
the
fact
that
she
be
the
eld
daughter
,
toward
whom
her
mamma
have
always
be
in
an
apologetic
state
of
mind
for
the
evil
bring
on
her
by
a
step
-
father
,
may
seem
so
full
a
reason
for
Gwendolen
's
domestic
empire
,
that
to
look
for
any
other
would
be
to
ask
the
reason
of
daylight
when
the
sun
be
shine
.
<EOS>
but
beware
of
arrive
at
conclusion
without
comparison
.
<EOS>
I
remember
have
see
the
same
assiduous
,
apologetic
attention
award
to
person
who
be
not
at
all
beautiful
or
unusual
,
whose
firmness
show
itself
in
no
very
graceful
or
euphonious
way
,
and
who
be
not
eld
daughter
with
a
tender
,
timid
mother
,
compunctious
at
have
subject
them
to
inconvenience
.
<EOS>
some
of
them
be
a
very
common
sort
of
man
.
<EOS>
and
the
only
point
of
resemblance
among
them
all
be
a
strong
determination
to
have
what
be
pleasant
,
with
a
total
fearlessness
in
make
themselves
disagreeable
or
dangerous
when
they
do
not
get
it
.
<EOS>
who
be
so
much
cajoled
and
serve
with
tremble
by
the
weak
female
of
a
household
as
the
unscrupulous
male
 
capable
,
if
he
have
not
free
way
at
home
,
of
go
and
do
bad
elsewhere
?
<EOS>
hence
I
be
force
to
doubt
whether
even
without
her
potent
charm
and
peculiar
filial
position
<EOS>
Gwendolen
may
not
still
have
play
the
queen
in
exile
,
if
only
she
have
keep
her
inborn
energy
of
egoistic
desire
,
and
her
power
of
inspire
fear
as
to
what
she
may
say
or
do
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
have
the
charm
,
and
those
who
fear
her
be
also
fond
of
her
;
the
fear
and
the
fondness
be
perhaps
both
heighten
by
what
may
be
call
the
iridescence
of
her
character
 
the
play
of
various
,
nay
,
contrary
tendency
.
<EOS>
for
Macbeth
's
rhetoric
about
the
impossibility
of
be
many
opposite
thing
in
the
same
moment
,
refer
to
the
clumsy
necessity
of
action
and
not
to
the
subtler
possibility
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
speak
a
loyal
word
and
be
meanly
silent
;
we
can
not
kill
and
not
kill
in
the
same
moment
;
but
a
moment
be
wide
enough
for
the
loyal
and
mean
desire
,
for
the
outlash
of
a
murderous
thought
and
the
sharp
backward
stroke
of
repentance
.
                                  
<EOS>
"
Her
wit
  
<EOS>
value
itself
so
highly
,
that
to
her
  
all
matter
else
seem
weak

<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
reception
in
the
neighborhood
fulfil
her
uncle
's
expectation
.
<EOS>
from
Brackenshaw
Castle
to
the
Firs
at
Wanchester
,
where
Mr.
Quallon
the
banker
keep
a
generous
house
,
she
be
welcome
with
manifest
admiration
,
and
even
those
lady
who
do
not
quite
like
her
,
feel
a
comfort
in
have
a
new
,
striking
girl
to
invite
;
for
hostess
who
entertain
much
must
make
up
their
party
as
minister
make
up
their
cabinet
,
on
ground
other
than
personal
liking
.
<EOS>
then
,
in
order
to
have
Gwendolen
as
a
guest
,
it
be
not
necessary
to
ask
any
one
who
be
disagreeable
,
for
Mrs.
Davilow
always
make
a
quiet
,
picturesque
figure
as
a
chaperon
,
and
Mr.
Gascoigne
be
everywhere
in
request
for
his
own
sake
.
  
<EOS>
among
the
house
where
Gwendolen
be
not
quite
like
,
and
yet
invite
,
be
Quetcham
Hall
.
<EOS>
one
of
her
first
invitation
be
to
a
large
dinner
-
party
there
,
which
make
a
sort
of
general
introduction
for
her
to
the
society
of
the
neighborhood
;
for
in
a
select
party
of
thirty
and
of
well
-
compose
proportion
as
to
age
,
few
visitable
family
could
be
entirely
leave
out
.
<EOS>
no
youthful
figure
there
be
comparable
to
Gwendolen
's
as
she
pass
through
the
long
suite
of
room
adorn
with
light
and
flower
,
and
,
visible
at
first
as
a
slim
figure
float
along
in
white
drapery
,
approach
through
one
wide
doorway
after
another
into
full
illumination
and
definiteness
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
have
that
sort
of
promenade
before
,
and
she
feel
exultingly
that
it
befit
her
:
<EOS>
any
one
look
at
her
for
the
first
time
may
have
suppose
that
long
gallery
and
lackey
have
always
be
a
matter
of
course
in
her
life
;
while
her
cousin
Anna
,
who
be
really
more
familiar
with
these
thing
,
feel
almost
as
much
embarrassed
as
a
rabbit
suddenly
deposit
in
that
well
-
light

space
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
that
with
Gascoigne
?
"
say
the
archdeacon
,
neglect
a
discussion
of
military
manoeuvre
on
which
,
as
a
clergyman
,
he
be
naturally
appeal
to

<EOS>
and
his
son
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
 
a
hopeful
young
scholar
,
who
have
already
suggest
some
"
not
less
elegant
than
ingenious
,
"
emendation
of
greek
text
 
say
nearly
at
the
same
time

by

<EOS>
who
be
that
girl
with
the
awfully
well
-
set
head
and
jolly
figure
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
to
a
mind
of
general
benevolence
,
wish
everybody
to
look
well
,
it
be
rather
exasperate
to
see
how
Gwendolen
eclipse
other
:
how
even
the
handsome
Miss
Lawe
,
explain
to
be
the
daughter
of
Lady
Lawe
,
look
suddenly
broad
,
heavy
and
inanimate
;
and
how
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
unfortunately
also
dress
in
white
,
immediately
resemble
a
_
carte
-
de
-
visite
_
in
which
one
would
fancy
the
skirt
alone
to
have
be
charge
for
.
<EOS>
since
Miss
Arrowpoint
be
generally
like
for
the
amiable
unpretending
way
in
which
she
wear
her
fortune
,
and
make
a
soften
screen
for
the
oddity
of
her
mother
,
there
seem
to
be
some
unfitness
in
Gwendolen
's
look
so
much
more
like
a
person
of
social
importance
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
not
really
so
handsome
if
you
come
to
examine
her
feature
,
"
say
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
later
in
the
evening
,
confidentially
to
Mrs.
Vulcany
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
certain
style
she
have
,
which
produce
a
great
effect
at
first
,
but
afterward
she
be
less
agreeable
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
fact
,
Gwendolen
,
not
intend
it
,
but
intend
the
contrary
,
have
offend
her
hostess
,
who
,
though
not
a
splenetic
or
vindictive
woman
,
have
her
susceptibility
.
<EOS>
several
condition
have
meet
in
the
Lady
of
Quetcham
which
to
the
reasoner
in
that
neighborhood
seem
to
have
an
essential
connection
with
each
other
.
<EOS>
It
be
occasionally
recall
that
she
have
be
the
heiress
of
a
fortune
gain
by
some
moist
or
dry
business
in
the
city
,
in
order
fully
to
account
for
her
have
a
squat
figure
,
a
harsh
parrot
-
like
voice
,
and
a
systematically
high
head
-
dress
;
and
since
these
point
make
her
externally
rather
ridiculous
,
it
appear
to
many
only
natural
that
she
should
have
what
be
call
literary
tendency
.
<EOS>
a
little
comparison
would
have
show
that
all
these
point
be
to
be
find
apart
;
daughter
of
alderman
be
often
well
-
grow
and
well
-
feature
,
pretty
woman
have
sometimes
harsh
or
husky
voice
,
and
the
production
of
feeble
literature
being
find
compatible
with
the
most
diverse
form
of
_
physique
_
,
masculine
as
well
as
feminine
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
who
have
a
keen
sense
of
absurdity
in
other
,
but
be
kindly
dispose
toward
any
one
who
could
make
life
agreeable
to
her
,
mean
to
win
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
by
give
her
an
interest
and
attention
beyond
what
other
be
probably
inclined
to
show
.
<EOS>
but
self
-
confidence
be
apt
to
address
itself
to
an
imaginary
dullness
in
other
;
as
people
who
be
well
off
speak
in
a
cajole
tone
to
the
poor
,
and
those
who
be
in
the
prime
of
life
raise
their
voice
and
talk
artificially
to
senior
,
hastily
conceive
them
to
be
deaf
and
rather
imbecile
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
with
all
her
cleverness
and
purpose
to
be
agreeable
,
could
not
escape
that
form
of
stupidity
:
it
follow
in
her
mind
,
unreflectingly
,
that
because
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
be
ridiculous
she
be
also
likely
to
be
want
in
penetration
,
and
she
go
through
her
little
scene
without
suspicion
that
the
various
shade
of
her
behavior
be
all
note
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
fond
of

well

Mrs.

<EOS>
Catherine
will
be
very
glad
to
have
so
sympathetic
a
neighbor

<EOS>
"
this
little
speech
may
have
seem
the
most
graceful
politeness
,
speak
in
a
low
,
melodious
tone
;
but
with
a
twang
,
fatally
loud
,
it
give
Gwendolen
a
sense
of
exercise
patronage
when
she
answer
,
gracefully
:
  
"
It
be
I

be
fortunate

<EOS>
Miss

teach

what
good

Catherine

<EOS>
We
have
a

Herr
Klesmer

perhaps
you
know

You

Catherine

how
delightful

<EOS>
for
an
instant
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
's
glance
be
a
little
sharp
,
but
the
perilous
resemblance
to
satire
in
the
last
sentence
take
the
hue
of
girlish
simplicity
when
Gwendolen
add
    
<EOS>
"
I
would
give
anything

Mrs.

encouragingly

acquaint
with

give
a

one
would
be
able
to
tell
then
which

funny

which
serious

<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
often
laugh
in
the
wrong
place
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
Gwendolen
herself
become
aware
of
danger
,
and
add
quickly
,
"
in
Shakespeare
,
you
know
,
and
other
great
writer
that
we
can
never
see
.
<EOS>
but
I
always
want
to
know
more
than
there
be
in
the
book
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
be
interested
in
any
of
my
subject
I
can
lend
you
many
extra
sheet
in
manuscript
,
"
say
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
 
while
Gwendolen
feel
herself
painfully
in
the
position
of
the
young
lady
who
profess
to
like
potted
sprat
.
  
<EOS>
"
these
be
thing
I
dare
<EOS>
say
I
shall
publish
eventually
:
several
friend
have
urge
me
to
do
so
,
and
one
do
not
like
to
be
obstinate
.
<EOS>
My
Tasso
,
for
example
 
I
could
have
make
it
twice
the
size
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
dote
on
Tasso
,
"

Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
you
shall
have
all
my
paper
,
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
so
many
,
you
know
,
have
write
about
Tasso
;
but
they
be
all
wrong
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
particular
nature
of
his
madness
,
and
his
feeling
for
Leonora
,
and
the
real
cause
of
his
imprisonment
,
and
the
character
of
Leonora
,
who
,
in
my
opinion
,
be
a
cold
-
hearted
woman
,
else
she
would
have
marry
him
in
spite
of
her
brother
 
<EOS>
they
be
all
wrong

<EOS>
I
differ
from
everybody
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
very
interesting
!
"
say
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
I
like
to
differ
from
everybody
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
so
stupid
to
agree
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
bad
of
write
your
opinion
;
and
make
people
agree
with
you
.
"
<EOS>
this
speech
renew
a
slight
suspicion
in
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
and
again
her
glance
become
for
a
moment
examine
.
<EOS>
but
Gwendolen
look
very
innocent
,
and
continue
with
a
docile
air
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
of
Tasso
except
the
_
Gerusalemme
Liberata
_
,
which
we
read
and
learn
by
heart
at
school
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
his
life
be
more
interesting
than
his
poetry
,
I
have
construct
the
early
part
of
his
life
as
a
sort
of
romance
.
<EOS>
when
one
think
of
his
father
Bernardo
,
and
so
on
,
there
be
much
that
must
be
true
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
imagination
be
often
true
than
fact
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
decisively
,
though
she
could
no
more
have
explain
these
glib
word
than
if
they
have
be
coptic
or
etruscan
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
so
glad
to
learn
all
about
Tasso
 
and
his
madness
especially
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
poet
be
always
a
little
mad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
 
"
the
poet
's
eye
in
a
fine
frenzy
rolling
"
;
and
somebody
say
of
Marlowe
      
<EOS>
"
for
that
fine
madness
still
he
do
maintain
,
  
which
always
should
possess
the
poet
's
brain
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
it
be
not
always
find
out
,
be
it
?
"
say
Gwendolen
innocently
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
some
of
them
roll
their
eye
in
private
.
<EOS>
mad
people
be
often
very
cunning
.
"
  
<EOS>
again
a
shade
flit
over
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
's
face
;
but
the
entrance
of
the
gentleman
prevent
any
immediate
mischief
between
her
and
this
too
quick
young
lady
,
who
have
over
-
act
her
_
naïveté
_
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
here
come
Herr
Klesmer
,
"
say
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
rise
;
and
presently
bring
him
to
Gwendolen
,
she
leave
them
to
a
dialogue
which
be
agreeable
on
both
side
,
Herr
Klesmer
be
a
felicitous
combination
of
the
german
,
the
Sclave
and
the
Semite
,
with
grand
feature
,
brown
hair
float
in
artistic
fashion
,
and
brown
eye
in
spectacle
.
<EOS>
His
English
have
little
foreignness
except
its
fluency
;
and
his
alarming
cleverness
be
make
less
formidable
just
then
by
a
certain
soften
air
of
silliness
which
will
sometimes
befall
even
genius
in
the
desire
of
be
agreeable
to
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
music
be
soon
begin
.
<EOS>
Miss
Arrowpoint
and
Herr
Klesmer
play
a
four
-
handed
piece
on
two
piano
,
which
convince
the
company
in
general
that
it
be
long
,
and
Gwendolen
in
particular
that
the
neutral
,
placid
-
faced
Miss
Arrowpoint
have
a
mastery
of
the
instrument
which
put
her
own
execution
out
of
question
 
though
she
be
not
discourage
as
to
her
often
-
praise
touch
and
style
.
<EOS>
after
this
every
one
become
anxious
to
hear
Gwendolen
sing
;
especially
Mr.
Arrowpoint
;
as
be
natural
in
a
host
and
a
perfect
gentleman
,
of
whom
no
one
have
anything
to
say
but
that
he
marry
Miss
Cuttler
and
import
the
good
cigar
;
and
he
lead
her
to
the
piano
with
easy
politeness
.
<EOS>
Herr
Klesmer
close
the
instrument
in
readiness
for
her
,
and
smile
with
pleasure
at
her
approach
;
then
place
himself
at
a
distance
of
a
few
foot
so
that
he
could
see
her
as
she
sing
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
be
not
nervous
;
what
she
undertake
to
do
she
do
without
tremble
,
and
singing
be
an
enjoyment
to
her
.
<EOS>
Her
voice
be
a
moderately
powerful
soprano
<EOS>
(
some
one
have
tell
her
it
be
like
Jenny
Lind
's
)
,
her
ear
good
,
and
she
be
able
to
keep
in
tune
,
so
that
her
singing
give
pleasure
to
ordinary
hearer
,
and
she
have
be
use
to
unmingle
applause
.
<EOS>
She
have
the
rare
advantage
of
look
almost
pretty
when
she
be
singe
than
at
other
time
,
and
that
Herr
Klesmer
be
in
front
of
her
seem
not
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
Her
song
,
determine
on
beforehand
,
be
a
favorite
aria
of
Belini
's
,
in
which
she
feel
quite
sure
of
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Charming
?
"
say
Mr.
Arrowpoint
,
who
have
remain
near
,
and
the
word
be
echo
around
without
more
insincerity
than
we
recognize
in
a
brotherly
way
as
human
.
<EOS>
but
Herr
Klesmer
stand
like
a
statue
 
if
a
statue
can
be
imagine
in
spectacle
;
at
least
,
he
be
as
mute
as
a
statue
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
be
press
to
keep
her
seat
and
double
the
general
pleasure
,
and
she
do
not
wish
to
refuse
;
but
before
resolve
to
do
so
,
she
move
a
little
toward
Herr
Klesmer
,
say
with
a
look
of
smile
appeal
,
"
It
would
be
too
cruel
to
a
great
musician
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
like
to
hear
poor
amateur
singe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
truly
;
but
that
make
nothing
,
"
say
Herr
Klesmer
,
suddenly
speak
in
an
odious
german
fashion
with
staccato
ending
,
quite
unobservable
in
him
before
,
and
apparently
depend
on
a
change
of
mood
,
as
Irishmen
resume
their
strong
brogue
when
they
be
fervid
or
quarrelsome
.
<EOS>
"
that
make
nothing
.
<EOS>
It
be
always
acceptable
to
see
you
sing
.
"
  
<EOS>
be
there
ever
so
unexpected
an
assertion
of
superiority
?
<EOS>
at
least
before
the
late
teutonic
conquest
?
<EOS>
Gwendolen
color
deeply
,
but
,
with
her
usual
presence
of
mind
,
do
not
show
an
ungraceful
resentment
by
move
away
immediately
;
and
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
who
have
be
near
enough
to
overhear
(
and
also
to
observe
that
Herr
Klesmer
's
mode
of
look
at
Gwendolen
be
more
conspicuously
admire
than
be
quite
consistent
with
good
taste
)
,
now
with
the
utmost
tact
and
kindness
come
close
to
her
and
say
    
"
imagine
what
I
have
to
go
through
with
this
professor
!
<EOS>
He
can
hardly
tolerate
anything
we
English
do
in
music
.
<EOS>
We
can
only
put
up
with
his
severity
,
and
make
use
of
it
to
find
out
the
bad
that
can
be
say
of
us
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
little
comfort
to
know
that
;
and
one
can
bear
it
when
every
one
else
be
admire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
very
much
oblige
to
him
for
tell
me
the
bad
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
recover
herself
.
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
I
have
be
extremely
ill
taught
,
in
addition
to
have
no
talent
 
only
like
for
music
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
very
well
express
considering
that
it
have
never
enter
her
mind
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
it
be
true
:
<EOS>
you
have
not
be
well
teach
,
"
say
Herr
Klesmer
,
quietly
.
<EOS>
woman
be
dear
to
him
,
but
music
be
dearer
.
"
<EOS>
still
,
you
be
not
quite
without
gift
.
<EOS>
You
sing
in
tune
,
and
you
have
a
pretty
fair
organ
.
<EOS>
but
you
produce
your
note
badly
;
and
that
music
which
you
sing
be
beneath
you
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
form
of
melody
which
express
a
puerile
state
of
culture
 
a
dawdling
,
cant
,
see
-
see
kind
of
stuff
 
the
passion
and
thought
of
people
without
any
breadth
of
horizon
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
sort
of
self
-
satisfied
folly
about
every
phrase
of
such
melody
;

Gwendolen

a
sinking

open
round
her
small
musical

this

be
startling

she

not

foolishly

Miss

help
her

yes

I
always
require
half
an
hour
to
get
up
my
courage

criticise
by
Herr
Klesmer

<EOS>
We
will
ask
him
to
play
to
us
now
:
he
be
bind
to
show
us
what
be
good
music
.
<EOS>
"
  
to
be
quite
safe
on
this
point
Herr
Klesmer
play
a
composition
of
his
own
,
a
fantasia
call
_
Freudvoll
,
Leidvoll
,
Gedankenvoll
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
an
extensive
commentary
on
some
melodic
idea
not
too
grossly
evident
;
and
he
certainly
fetch
as
much
variety
and
depth
of
passion
out
of
the
piano
as
that
moderately
responsive
instrument
lend
itself
to
,
have
an
imperious
magic
in
his
finger
that
seem
to
send
a
nerve
-
thrill
through
ivory
key
and
wooden
hammer
,
and
compel
the
string
to
make
a
quivering
linger
speech
for
him

<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
in
spite
of
her
wound
egoism
,
have
fullness
of
nature
enough
to
feel
the
power
of
this
playing
,
and
it
gradually
turn
her
inward
sob
of
mortification
into
an
excitement
which
lift
her
for
the
moment
into
a
desperate
indifference
about
her
own
doing
,
or
at
least
a
determination
to
get
a
superiority
over
them
by
laugh
at
them
as

they
belong

somebody
else

Her

fortunate

take

come
up
to
renew
conversation

soon

the
style

I
never

make
anything

we
should

glad

another

relaxation

Mrs.

who
have
also
come
near
with
polite
intention

that
must
be
because
you
be
in
a
puerile
state
of
culture

have
no
breadth
of

I
have
just
learn
that

I

Gwendolen

take
any
notice
of
Mrs.

look
up
with
a
bright
smile
at
young
Clintock

<EOS>
Mrs.

be
not
insensible
to
this
rudeness
,
but
merely
say
,
"
well
,
we
will
not
press
anything
disagreeably

"
and
as
there
be
a
perceptible
outburst
of
imprison
conversation
just
then

and
a
movement
of
guest
seek
each
other

she
remain
seated
where
she

look
around
her

I

pleased
with
his
station
in

of
Gwendolen

there
seem
to
be
a
little
of

of
anything

rather
equivocal
praise

Mrs.

who
be
hear
this
dialogue

perceive
quite
a
new
tone
in
Gwendolen

feel

"
I
think
there
should
be
more
croquet

for

thing

"
young

"
I
be
usually
away

if
I

You

I

<EOS>
It
want
writing

<EOS>
one
of

have
write
a
poem
on

in
four

as
good
as

I
want
him
to
publish
it

You

I
shall
study
croquet

I
shall
take

"
  
<EOS>
"
no

no

not
that

do
take
to

I
will
send

will
you
promise
not

catechise
me
upon

ask
me
which
part
I

good

<EOS>
because
it
be
not

easy
to
know
a

without
read
it

decidedly

Gwendolen

continue

not

because
invitation

large

that
lofty

cause
Gwendolen
a

pain

She
would
not

unfortunate
she

musical
advantage

be
able

question
Herr

's
taste
with
the
confidence
of
thorough
knowledge
;
still
less
,
to
admit
even
to
herself
that
Miss
Arrowpoint
each
time
they
meet
raise
an
unwonted
feeling
of
jealousy
in
her
:
not
in
the
least
because
she
be
an
heiress
,
but
because
it
be
really
provoking
that
a
girl
whose
appearance
you
could
not
characterize
except
by
say
that
her
figure
be
slight
and
of
middle
stature
,
her
feature
small
,
her
eye
tolerable
,
and
her
complexion
sallow
,
have
nevertheless
a
certain
mental
superiority
which
could
not
be
explain
away
 
an
exasperating
thoroughness
in
her
musical
accomplishment
,
a
fastidious
discrimination
in
her
general
taste
,
which
make
it
impossible
to
force
her
admiration
and
keep
you
in
awe
of
her
standard
.
<EOS>
this
insignificant
-
look
young
lady
of
four
-
and
-
twenty
,
whom
any
one
's
eye
would
have
pass
over
negligently
if
she
have
not
be
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
may
be
suspect
of
a
secret
opinion
that
Miss
Harleth
's
acquirement
be
rather
of
a
common
order
,
and
such
an
opinion
be
not
make
agreeable
to
think
of
by
be
always
veil
under
a
perfect
kindness
of
manner
.
  
<EOS>
but
Gwendolen
do
not
like
to
dwell
on
fact
which
throw
an
unfavorable
light
on
itself
.
<EOS>
the
musical
Magus
who
have
so
suddenly
widen
her
horizon
be
not
always
on
the
scene
;
and
his
be
constantly
backward
and
forward
between
London
and
Quetcham
soon
begin
to
be
think
of
as
offer
opportunity
for
convert
him
to
a
more
admiring
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
in
the
manifest
pleasure
her
singing
give
at
Brackenshaw
Castle
,
the
Firs
,
and
elsewhere
,
she
recover
her
equanimity
,
be
dispose
to
think
approval
more
trustworthy
than
objection
,
and
not
be
one
of
the
exceptional
person
who
have
a
parching
thirst
for
a
perfection
undemande
by
their
neighbor
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
would
have
be
rash
to
say
then
that
she
be
at
all
exceptional
inwardly
,
or
that
the
unusual
in
her
be
more
than
her
rare
grace
of
movement
and
bearing
,
and
a
certain
daring
which
give
piquancy
to
a
very
common
egoistic
ambition
,
such
as
exist
under
many
clumsy
exterior
and
be
take
no
notice
of
.
<EOS>
for
I
suppose
that
the
set
of
the
head
do
not
really
determine
the
hunger
of
the
inner
self
for
supremacy
<EOS>
:
it
only
make
a
difference
sometimes
as
to
the
way
in
which
the
supremacy
be
hold
attainable
,
and
a
little
also
to
the
degree
in
which
it
can
be
attain
;
especially
when
the
hungry
one
be
a
girl
,
whose
passion
for
do
what
be
remarkable
have
an
ideal
limit
in
consistency
with
the
high
breeding
and
perfect
freedom
from
the
sordid
need
of
income
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
be
as
inwardly
rebellious
against
the
restraint
of
family
condition
,
and
as
ready
to
look
through
obligation
into
her
own
fundamental
want
of
feel
for
them
,
as
if
she
have
be
sustain
by
the
bold
speculation
;
but
she
really
have
no
such
speculation
,
and
would
at
once
have
mark
herself
off
from
any
sort
of
theoretical
or
practically
reform
woman
by
satirize
them
.
<EOS>
She
rejoice
to
feel
herself
exceptional
;
but
her
horizon
be
that
of
the
genteel
romance
where
the
heroine
's
soul
pour
out
in
her
journal
be
full
of
vague
power
,
originality
,
and
general
rebellion
,
while
her
life
move
strictly
in
the
sphere
of
fashion
;
and
if
she
wander
into
a
swamp
,
the
pathos
lie
partly
,
so
to
speak
,
in
her
have
on
her
satin
shoe
.
<EOS>
here
be
a
restraint
which
nature
and
society
have
provide
on
the
pursuit
of
strike
adventure
;
so
that
a
soul
burn
with
a
sense
of
what
the
universe
be
not
,
and
ready
to
take
all
existence
as
fuel
,
be
nevertheless
hold
captive
by
the
ordinary
wirework
of
social
form
and
do
nothing
particular
.
  
<EOS>
this
commonplace
result
be
what
Gwendolen
find
herself
threaten
with
even
in
the
novelty
of
the
first
winter
at
Offendene
.
<EOS>
what
she
be
clear
upon
be
,
that
she
do
not
wish
to
lead
the
same
sort
of
life
as
ordinary
young
lady
do
;
but
what
she
be
not
clear
upon
be
,
how
she
should
set
about
lead
any
other
,
and
what
be
the
particular
act
which
she
would
assert
her
freedom
by
do
.
<EOS>
Offendene
remain
a
good
background
,
if
anything
would
happen
there
;
but
on
the
whole
the
neighborhood
be
in
fault
.
  
<EOS>
beyond
the
effect
of
her
beauty
on
a
first
presentation
,
there
be
not
much
excitement
to
be
get
out
of
her
early
invitation
,
and
she
come
home
after
little
sally
of
satire
and
knowingness
,
such
as
have
offend
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
to
fill
the
intervene
day
with
the
most
girlish
device
.
<EOS>
the
strong
assertion
<EOS>
she
be
able
to
make
of
her
individual
claim
be
to
leave
out
Alice
's
lesson
(
on
the
principle
that
Alice
be
more
likely
to
excel
in
ignorance
)
,
and
to
employ
her
with
Miss
Merry
,
and
the
maid
who
be
understand
to
wait
on
all
the
lady
,
in
help
to
arrange
various
dramatic
costume
which
Gwendolen
please
herself
with
have
in
readiness
for
some
future
occasion
of
act
in
charade
or
theatrical
piece
,
occasion
which
she
mean
to
bring
about
by
force
of
will
or
contrivance
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
act
 
only
make
a
figure
in
_
<EOS>
tableaux
vivan
_
at
school
;
but
<EOS>
she
feel
assured
that
she
could
act
well
,
and
have
be
once
or
twice
to
the
Théâtre
Français
,
and
also
hear
her
mamma
speak
of
Rachel
,
her
waking
dream
and
cogitation
as
to
how
she
would
manage
her
destiny
sometimes
turn
on
the
question
whether
she
would
become
an
actress
like
Rachel
,
since
she
be
more
beautiful
than
that
thin
Jewess
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
the
wet
day
before
Christmas
be
pass
pleasantly
in
the
preparation
of
costume
,
greek
,
oriental
,
and
Composite
,
in
which
Gwendolen
attitudinize
and
speechify
before
a
domestic
audience
,
include
even
the
housekeeper
,
who
be
once
press
into
it
that
she
may
swell
the
note
of
applause
;
but
have
show
herself
unworthy
by
observe
that
Miss
Harleth
look
far
more
like
a
queen
in
her
own
dress
than
in
that
baggy
thing
with
her
arm
all
bare
,
she
be
not
invite
a
second
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
I
look
as
well
as
Rachel
,
mamma

"
say
Gwendolen
,
one
day
when
she
have
be
show
herself
in
her
greek
dress
to
Anna
,
and
go
through
scrap
of
scene
with
much
tragic
intention
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
well
arm
than
Rachel
,
"
say
Mrs.
Davilow
,
"
your
arm
would
do
for
anything

Gwen

<EOS>
but
your
voice
be
not

tragic

hers

it
be
not

deep

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
make
it
deep
,
if
I
like
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
provisionally
;
then
she
add
,
with
decision
,
"
I
think
a
high
voice
be
more
tragic
:
it
be
more
feminine
;
and
the
more
feminine
a
woman
be
,
<EOS>
the
more
tragic
it
seem
when
she
do
desperate
action

"
there
may
be
something
in
that

I
do
not
know
what
good
there
be

be
anything
horrible

all
the
great
poetic
criminal
be
not
woman
!
<EOS>
I
think
the
man
be
poor
cautious
creature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
dear
,
and
you
 
who
be
afraid
to
be
alone
in
the
night
 
I
do
not
think
you
would
be
very
bold
in
crime
,
thank
God
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
talk
about
reality
,
mamma
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
then
her
mamma
be
call
out
of
the
room
,
she
turn
quickly
to
her
cousin
,
as
if
take
an
opportunity
,
and
say
,
"
Anna
,
do
ask
my
uncle
to
let
us
get
up
some
charade
at
the
rectory
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Middleton
and
Warham
could
act
with
us
 
just
for
practice
.
<EOS>
Mamma
say
it
will
not
do
to
have
Mr.
Middleton
consulting
and
rehearsing
here
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
stick
,
but
we
could
give
him
suitable
part
.
<EOS>
do
ask
,
or
else
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
not
till
Rex
come
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
clever
,
and
such
a
dear
old
thing
,
and
he
will
act
Napoleon
look
over
the
sea
.
<EOS>
He
look
just
like
Napoleon
.
<EOS>
Rex
can
do
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
in
the
least
believe
in
your
Rex
,
Anna
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
laugh
at
her
.
"
<EOS>
He
will
turn
out
to
be
like
those
wretched
blue
and
yellow
water
-
color
of
his
which
you
hang
up
in
your
bedroom
and
worship
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
you
will
see
,
"
say
Anna
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
that
I
know
what
be
clever
,
but
he
have
get
a
scholarship
already
,
and
papa
say
he
will
get
a
fellowship
,
and
nobody
be
well
at
game
.
<EOS>
He
be
clever
than
Mr.
Middleton
,
and
everybody
<EOS>
but
you
call
Mr.
Middleton
clever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
he
may
be
in
a
dark
-
lantern
sort
of
way
.
<EOS>
but
he
_
be
_
a
stick
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
to
say
,
"
perdition
catch
my
soul
,
but
I
do
love
her
,
"
he
would
say
it
in
just
the
same
tone
as
,
"
here
endeth
the
second
lesson
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
oh
,
Gwendolen
!
"
say
Anna
,
shock
at
these
promiscuous
allusion
.
<EOS>
"
and
it
be
very
unkind
of
you
to
speak
so
of
him
,
for
he
admire
you
very
much
.
<EOS>
I
hear
Warham
say
one
day
to
mamma
,
"
Middleton
be
regularly
spooney
upon
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
very
angry
with
him
;
but
I
know
what
it
mean
.
<EOS>
It
be
what
they
say
at
college
for
be
in
love
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
I
help
it
?
"
say
Gwendolen
,
rather
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
perdition
catch
my
soul
if
I
love
_
him
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
of
course
;
papa
,
I
think
,
would
not
wish
it
.
<EOS>
and
he
be
to
go
away
soon
.
<EOS>
but
it
make
me
sorry
when
you
ridicule
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
shall
you
do
to
me
when
I
ridicule
Rex
?
"
say
Gwendolen
,
wickedly
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
Gwendolen
,
dear
,
you
_
will
not
_
?
"
say
Anna
,
her
eye
fill
with
tear
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
but
there
really
be
nothing
in
him
to
ridicule
.
<EOS>
only
you
may
find
out
thing
.
<EOS>
for
no
one
ever
think
of
laugh
at
Mr.
Middleton
before
you
.
<EOS>
every
one
say
he
be
nice
-
looking
,
and
his
manner
perfect
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
have
always
be
frightened
at
him
because
of
his
learning
and
his
square
-
cut
coat
,
and
his
be
a
nephew
of
the
bishop
's
,
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
but
you
will
not
ridicule
<EOS>
Rex
 
promise
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Anna
end
with
a
beseech
look
which
touch
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
dear
little
coz
,
"
she
say
,
just
touch
the
tip
of
Anna
's
chin
with
her
thumb
and
forefinger
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
ever
want
to
do
anything
that
will
vex
you
.
<EOS>
especially
if
Rex
be
to
make
everything
come
off
 
charade
and
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
when
at
last
Rex
be
there
,
the
animation
he
bring
into
the
life
of
Offendene
and
the
rectory
,
and
his
ready
partnership
in
Gwendolen
's
plan
,
leave
her
no
inclination
for
any
ridicule
that
be
not
of
an
open
and
flattering
kind
,
such
as
he
himself
enjoy
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
fine
open
-
hearted
youth
,
with
a
handsome
face
strongly
resemble
his
father
's
and
Anna
's
,
but
soft
in
expression
than
the
one
,
and
large
in
scale
than
the
other
:
a
bright
,
healthy
,
love
nature
,
enjoy
ordinary
innocent
thing
so
much
that
vice
have
no
temptation
for
him
,
and
what
he
know
of
it
lie
too
entirely
in
the
outer
court
and
little
-
visit
chamber
of
his
mind
for
him
to
think
of
it
with
great
repulsion
.
<EOS>
vicious
habit
be
with
him
"
<EOS>
what
some
fellow
do
"
 
"
stupid
stuff
"
which
he
like
to
keep
aloof
from
.
<EOS>
He
return
Anna
's
affection
as
fully
as
could
be
expect
of
a
brother
whose
pleasure
apart
from
her
be
more
than
the
sum
total
of
hers
;
and
he
have
never
know
a
strong
love
.
  
<EOS>
the
cousin
be
continually
together
at
the
one
house
or
the
other
 
chiefly
at
Offendene
,
where
there
be
more
freedom
,
or
rather
where
there
be
a
more
complete
sway
for
Gwendolen
;
and
whatever
she
wish
become
a
rule
purpose
for
Rex
.
<EOS>
the
charade
come
off
accord
to
her
plan
;
and
also
some
other
little
scene
not
contemplate
by
her
in
which
her
acting
be
more
impromptu
.
<EOS>
It
be
at
Offendene
that
the
charade
and
_
tableaux
<EOS>
_
be
rehearse
and
present
,
Mrs.
Davilow
see
no
objection
even
to
Mr.
Middleton
's
be
invite
to
share
in
them
,
now
that
Rex
too
be
there
 
especially
as
his
service
be
indispensable
:
Warham
,
who
be
study
for
India
with
a
Wanchester
"
coach
,
"
have
no
time
to
spare
,
and
be
generally
dismal
under
a
cram
of
everything
except
the
answer
need
at
the
forthcoming
examination
,
which
may
disclose
the
welfare
of
our
Indian
Empire
to
be
somehow
connect
with
a
quotable
knowledge
of
Browne
's
Pastorals
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Middleton
be
persuade
to
play
various
grave
part
,
Gwendolen
have
flatter
him
on
his
enviable
immobility
of
countenance
;
and
at
first
a
little
pained
and
jealous
at
her
comradeship
with
Rex
,
he
presently
draw
encouragement
from
the
thought
that
this
sort
of
cousinly
familiarity
exclude
any
serious
passion
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
occasionally
feel
that
her
more
formal
treatment
of
himself
be
such
a
sign
of
favor
as
to
warrant
his
make
advance
before
he
leave
Pennicote
,
though
he
have
intend
to
keep
his
feeling
in
reserve
until
his
position
should
be
more
assured
.
<EOS>
Miss
Gwendolen
,
quite
aware
that
she
be
adore
by
this
unexceptionable
young
clergyman
with
pale
whisker
and
square
-
cut
collar
<EOS>
,
feel
nothing
more
on
the
subject
than
that
she
have
no
objection
to
be
adore
:
she
turn
her
eye
on
him
with
calm
mercilessness
and
cause
him
many
mildly
agitate
hope
by
seem
always
to
avoid
dramatic
contact
with
him
 
for
all
meaning
,
we
know
,
depend
on
the
key
of
interpretation
.
  
<EOS>
some
person
may
have
think
beforehand
that
a
young
man
of
anglican
leaning
,
have
a
sense
of
sacredness
much
exercise
on
small
thing
as
well
as
great
,
rarely
laugh
save
from
politeness
,
and
in
general
regard
the
mention
of
spade
by
their
naked
name
as
rather
coarse
,
would
not
have
see
a
fitting
bride
for
himself
in
a
girl
who
be
dare
in
ridicule
,
and
show
none
of
the
special
grace
require
in
the
clergyman
's
wife
;
or
,
that
a
young
man
inform
by
theological
reading
would
have
reflect
that
he
be
not
likely
to
meet
the
taste
of
a
lively
,
restless
young
lady
like
Miss
Harleth
.
<EOS>
but
be
we
always
oblige
to
explain
why
the
fact
be
not
what
some
person
think
beforehand
?
<EOS>
the
apology
lie
on
their
side
,
who
have
that
erroneous
way
of
thinking
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Rex
,
who
would
possibly
have
be
sorry
for
poor
Middleton
if
he
have
be
aware
of
the
excellent
curate
's
inward
conflict
,
he
be
too
completely
absorb
in
a
first
passion
to
have
observation
for
any
person
or
thing
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
observe
Gwendolen
;
he
only
feel
what
she
say
or
do
,
and
the
back
of
his
head
seem
to
be
a
good
organ
of
information
as
to
whether
she
be
in
the
room
or
out
.
<EOS>
before
the
end
of
the
first
fortnight
he
be
so
deeply
in
love
that
it
be
impossible
for
him
to
think
of
his
life
except
as
bind
up
with
Gwendolen
's
.
<EOS>
He
could
see
no
obstacle
,
poor
boy
;
his
own
love
seem
a
guarantee
of
hers
,
since
it
be
one
with
the
unperturbed
delight
in
her
image
,
so
that
he
could
no
more
dream
of
her
give
him
pain
than
an
Egyptian
could
dream
of
snow
.
<EOS>
She
sing
and
play
to
him
whenever
he
like
,
be
always
glad
of
his
companionship
in
ride
,
though
his
borrow
steed
be
often
comic
,
be
ready
to
join
in
any
fun
of
his
,
and
show
a
right
appreciation
of
Anna
.
<EOS>
no
mark
of
sympathy
seem
absent
.
<EOS>
that
because
Gwendolen
be
the
most
perfect
creature
in
the
world
she
be
to
make
a
grand
match
,
have
not
occur
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
conceit
 
at
least
not
more
than
go
to
make
up
the
necessary
gum
and
consistence
of
a
substantial
personality
:
it
be
only
that
in
the
young
bliss
of
love
he
take
Gwendolen
's
perfection
as
part
of
that
good
which
have
seem
one
with
life
to
him
,
be
the
outcome
of
a
happy
,
well
-
embody
nature
.
  
<EOS>
one
incident
which
happen
in
the
course
of
their
dramatic
attempt
impress
Rex
as
a
sign
of
her
unusual
sensibility
.
<EOS>
It
show
an
aspect
of
her
nature
which
could
not
have
be
preconceive
by
any
one
who
,
like
him
,
have
only
see
her
habitual
fearlessness
in
active
exercise
and
her
high
spirit
in
society
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
good
deal
of
rehearsing
it
be
resolve
that
a
select
party
should
be
invite
to
Offendene
to
witness
the
performance
which
go
with
so
much
satisfaction
to
the
actor
.
<EOS>
Anna
have
cause
a
pleasant
surprise
;
nothing
could
be
neater
than
the
way
in
which
she
play
her
little
part
;
one
would
even
have
suspect
her
of
hide
much
sly
observation
under
her
simplicity
.
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Middleton
answer
very
well
by
not
try
to
be
comic
.
<EOS>
the
main
source
of
doubt
and
retardation
have
be
Gwendolen
's
desire
to
appear
in
her
greek
dress
.
<EOS>
no
word
for
a
charade
would
occur
to
her
either
wake
or
dream
that
suit
her
purpose
of
get
a
statuesque
pose
in
this
favorite
costume
.
<EOS>
to
choose
a
motive
from
Racine
be
of
no
use
,
since
Rex
and
the
other
could
not
declaim
french
verse
,
and
improvise
speech
would
turn
the
scene
into
burlesque
.
<EOS>
besides
,
Mr.
Gascoigne
prohibit
the
acting
of
scene
from
play
:
he
usually
protest
against
the
notion
that
an
amusement
which
be
fit
for
every
one
else
be
unfit
for
a
clergyman
;
but
he
would
not
in
this
matter
overstep
the
line
of
decorum
as
draw
in
that
part
of
Wessex
,
which
do
not
exclude
his
sanction
of
the
young
people
's
acting
charade
in
his
sister
-
in
-
law
's
house
 
a
very
different
affair
from
private
theatrical
in
the
full
sense
of
the
word
.
  
<EOS>
everybody
of
course
be
concern
to
satisfy
this
wish
of
Gwendolen
's
,
and
Rex
propose
that
they
should
wind
up
with
a
tableau
in
which
the
effect
of
her
majesty
would
not
be
mar
by
any
one
's
speech
.
<EOS>
this
please
her
thoroughly
,
and
the
only
question
be
the
choice
of
the
tableau
.
  
<EOS>
"
something
pleasant
,
child
,
I
beseech
you
,
"
say
Mrs.
Davilow
;
"
I
can
not
have
any
greek
wickedness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
no
bad
than
christian
wickedness
,
mamma
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
whose
mention
of
Rachelesque
heroine
have
call
forth
that
remark
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
less
scandalous
,
"
say
Rex
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
besides
,
one
think
of
it
as
all
go
by
and
do
with
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
say
to
Briseis
be
lead
away
?
<EOS>
I
would
be
Achilles
,
and
you
would
be
look
round
at
me
 
after
the
print
we
have
at
the
rectory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
would
be
a
good
attitude
for
me
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
in
a
tone
of
acceptance
.
<EOS>
but
afterward
she
say
with
decision
,
"
no
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
do
.
<EOS>
there
must
be
three
man
in
proper
costume
,
else
it
will
be
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
it
,
"
say
Rex
,
after
a
little
reflection
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
hermione
as
the
statue
in
Winter
's
Tale
?
<EOS>
I
will
be
Leontes
,
and
Miss
Merry
,
Paulina
,
one
on
each
side
.
<EOS>
Our
dress
will
not
signify
,
"
he
go
on
laughingly
;
"
it
will
be
more
shakespearian
and
romantic
if
leonte
look
like
Napoleon
,
and
Paulina
like
a
modern
spinster
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
Hermione
be
choose
;
all
agree
that
age
be
of
no
consequence
,
but
Gwendolen
urge
that
instead
of
the
mere
tableau
there
should
be
just
enough
acting
of
the
scene
to
introduce
the
striking
up
of
the
music
as
a
signal
for
her
to
step
down
and
advance
;
when
Leontes
,
instead
of
embrace
her
,
be
to
kneel
and
kiss
the
hem
of
her
garment
,
and
so
the
curtain
be
to
fall
.
<EOS>
the
antechamber
with
fold
door
lend
itself
admirably
to
the
purpose
of
a
stage
,
and
the
whole
of
the
establishment
,
with
the
addition
of
Jarrett
the
village
carpenter
,
be
absorb
in
the
preparation
for
an
entertainment
,
which
,
consider
that
it
be
an

<EOS>
Gwendolen
be
not
without
a
special
exultation
in
the
prospect
of
this
occasion
,
for
she
know
that
Herr
Klesmer
be
again
at
Quetcham
,
and
she
have
take
care
to
include
him
among
the
invite
.
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
come
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
one
of
his
placid
,
silent
mood
,
and
sit
in
serene
contemplation
,
reply
to
all
appeal
in
benignant
-
sound
syllable
more
or
less
articulate
 
as
take
up
his
cross
meekly
in
a
world
overgrow
with
amateur
,
or
as
careful
how
he
move
his
lion
paw
lest
he
should
crush
a
rampant
and
vociferous
mouse
.
  
<EOS>
everything
indeed
go
off
smoothly
and
accord
to
expectation
 
all
that
be
improvise
and
accidental
being
of
a
probable
sort
 
until
the
incident
occur
which
show
Gwendolen
in
an
unforeseen
phase
of
emotion
.
<EOS>
how
it
come
about
be
at
first
a
mystery
.
  
<EOS>
the
tableau
of
Hermione
be
doubly
strike
from
its
dissimilarity
with
what
have
go
before
:
it
be
answer
perfectly
,
and
a
murmur
of
applause
have
be
gradually
suppress
while
leonte
give
his
permission
that
Paulina
should
exercise
her
utmost
art
and
make
the
statue
move
.
  
<EOS>
Hermione
,
her
arm
rest
on
a
pillar
,
be
elevate
by
about
six
inch
,
which
she
count
on
as
a
means
of
show
her
pretty
foot
and
instep
,
when
at
the
give
signal
she
should
advance
and
descend
.
  
<EOS>
"
music
,
awake
her
,
strike
!
"
<EOS>
say
Paulina
(
Mrs.
Davilow
,
who
,
by
special
entreaty
,
have
consent
to
take
the
part
in
a
white
burnous
and
hood
)
.
  
<EOS>
Herr
Klesmer
,
who
have
be
good
-
natured
enough
to
seat
himself
at
the
piano
,
strike
a
thunderous
chord
 
but
in
the
same
instant
,
and
before
Hermione
have
put
forth
her
foot
,
the
movable
panel
,
which
be
on
a
line
with
the
piano
,
fly
open
on
the
right
opposite
the
stage
and
disclose
the
picture
of
the
dead
face
and
the
flee
figure
,
bring
out
in
pale
definiteness
by
the
position
of
the
wax
-
light
.
<EOS>
everyone
be
startle
,
but
all
eye
in
the
act
of
turn
toward
the
open
panel
be
recall
by
a
piercing
cry
from
Gwendolen
,
who
stand
without
change
of
attitude
,
but
with
a
change
of
expression
that
be
terrify
in
its
terror
.
<EOS>
She
look
like
a
statue
into
which
a
soul
of
Fear
have
enter
:
her
pallid
lip
be
part
;
her
eye
,
usually
narrow
under
their
long
lash
,
be
dilate
and
fix
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
,
less
surprised
than
alarm
,
rush
toward
her
,
and
Rex
,
too
,
could
not
help
go
to
her
side
.
<EOS>
but
the
touch
of
her
mother
's
arm
have
the
effect
of
an
electric
charge
;
Gwendolen
fall
on
her
knee
and
put
her
hand
before
her
face
.
<EOS>
She
be
still
tremble
,
but
mute
,
and
it
seem
that
she
have
self
-
consciousness
enough
to
aim
at
control
her
sign
of
terror
,
for
she
presently
allow
herself
to
be
raise
from
her
kneel
posture
and
lead
away
,
while
the
company
be
relieve
their
mind
by
explanation
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
magnificent
bit
of
_
plastik
_
that
!
"
say
Klesmer
to
Miss
Arrowpoint
.
<EOS>
and
a
quick
fire
of
undertoned
question
and
answer
go
round
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
part
of
the
play
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
,
surely
not
.
<EOS>
Miss
Harleth
be
too
much
affected
.
<EOS>
a
sensitive
creature
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
dear
me
!
<EOS>
I
be
not
aware
that
there
be
a
painting
behind
that
panel
;
be
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
how
should
I
?
<EOS>
some
eccentricity
in
one
of
the
Earl
's
family
long
ago
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
very
painful
!
<EOS>
pray
shut
it
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
the
door
lock
?
<EOS>
It
be
very
mysterious
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
the
spirit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
there
be
no
medium
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
know
that
?
<EOS>
We
must
conclude
that
there
be
,
when
such
thing
happen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
the
door
be
not
lock
;
it
be
probably
the
sudden
vibration
from
the
piano
that
send
it
open
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
conclusion
come
from
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
who
beg
Miss
Merry
if
possible
to
get
the
key
.
<EOS>
but
this
readiness
to
explain
the
mystery
be
think
by
Mrs.
Vulcany
unbecome
in
a
clergyman
,
and
she
observe
in
an
undertone
that
Mr.
Gascoigne
be
always
a
little
too
worldly
for
her
taste
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
key
be
produce
,
and
the
rector
turn
it
in
the
lock
with
an
emphasis
rather
offensively
rationalize
 
as
who
should
say
,
"
it
will
not
start
open
again
"
 
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
as
a
security
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
Gwendolen
soon
reappear
,
show
her
usual
spirit
,
and
evidently
determine
to
ignore
as
far
as
she
could
the
strike
change
she
have
make
in
the
part
of
Hermione
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
Klesmer
say
to
her
,
"
We
have
to
thank
you
for
devise
a
perfect
climax
<EOS>
:
you
could
not
have
choose
a
fine
bit
of
_
plastik
_
,
"
there
be
a
flush
of
pleasure
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
She
like
to
accept
as
a
belief
what
be
really
no
more
than
delicate
feign
.
<EOS>
He
divine
that
the
betrayal
into
a
passion
of
fear
have
be
mortify
to
her
,
and
wish
her
to
understand
that
he
take
it
for
good
acting
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
cherish
the
idea
that
now
he
be
strike
with
her
talent
as
well
as
her
beauty
,
and
her
uneasiness
about
his
opinion
be
half
turn
to
complacency
.
  
<EOS>
but
too
many
be
in
the
secret
of
what
have
be
include
in
the
rehearsal
,
and
what
have
not
,
and
no
one
besides
Klesmer
take
the
trouble
to
soothe
Gwendolen
's
imagine
mortification
.
<EOS>
the
general
sentiment
be
that
the
incident
should
be
let
drop
.
  
<EOS>
there
have
really
be
a
medium
concern
in
the
starting
open
of
the
panel
:
one
who
have
quit
the
room
in
haste
and
creep
to
bed
in
much
alarm
of
conscience
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
small
Isabel
,
whose
intense
curiosity
,
unsatisfie
by
the
brief
glimpse
she
have
have
of
the
strange
picture
on
the
day
of
arrival
at
Offendene
,
have
keep
her
on
the
watch
for
an
opportunity
of
find
out
where
Gwendolen
have
put
the
key
,
of
steal
it
from
the
discover
drawer
when
the
rest
of
the
family
be
out
,
and
get
on
a
stool
to
unlock
the
panel
.
<EOS>
while
she
be
indulge
her
thirst
for
knowledge
in
this
way
,
a
noise
which
she
fear
be
an
approach
footstep
alarm
her
<EOS>
:
she
close
the
door
and
attempt
hurriedly
to
lock
it
,
but
fail
and
not
daring
to
linger
,
she
withdraw
the
key
and
trust
that
the
panel
would
stick
,
as
it
seem
well
inclined
to
do
.
<EOS>
in
this
confidence
she
have
return
the
key
to
its
former
place
,
still
any
anxiety
by
the
thought
that
if
the
door
be
discover
to
be
unlocked
nobody
would
know
how
the
unlocking
come
about
.
<EOS>
the
inconvenient
Isabel
,
like
other
offender
,
do
not
foresee
her
own
impulse
to
confession
,
a
fatality
which
come
upon
her
the
morning
after
the
party
,
when
Gwendolen
say
at
the
breakfast
-
table
,
"
I
know
the
door
be
lock
before
the
housekeeper
give
me
the
key
,
for
I
try
it
myself
afterward
.
<EOS>
some
one
must
have
be
to
my
drawer
and
take
the
key
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
seem
to
Isabel
that
Gwendolen
's
awful
eye
have
rest
on
her
more
than
on
the
other
sister
,
and
without
any
time
for
resolve
,
she
say
,
with
a
tremble
lip
:
  
"
please
forgive
me
,
Gwendolen
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
forgiveness
be
sooner
bestow
than
it
would
have
be
if
Gwendolen
have
not
desire
to
dismiss
from
her
own
and
every
one
else
's
memory
any
case
in
which
she
have
show
her
susceptibility
to
terror
.
<EOS>
She
wonder
at
herself
in
these
occasional
experience
,
which
seem
like
a
brief
remember
madness
,
an
unexplained
exception
from
her
normal
life
;
and
in
this
instance
she
feel
a
peculiar
vexation
that
her
helpless
fear
have
show
itself
,
not
,
as
usual
,
in
solitude
,
but
in
well
-
light
company
.
<EOS>
Her
ideal
be
to
be
dare
in
speech
and
reckless
in
brave
danger
,
both
moral
and
physical
;
and
though
her
practice
fall
far
behind
her
ideal
,
this
shortcoming
seem
to
be
due
to
the
pettiness
of
circumstance
,
the
narrow
theatre
which
life
offer
to
a
girl
of
twenty
,
who
can
not
conceive
herself
as
anything
else
than
a
lady
,
or
as
in
any
position
which
would
lack
the
tribute
of
respect
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
permanent
consciousness
of
other
fetter
,
or
of
more
spiritual
restraint
,
have
always
dislike
whatever
be
present
to
her
under
the
name
of
religion
,
in
the
same
way
that
some
people
dislike
arithmetic
and
account
:
it
have
raise
no
other
emotion
in
her
,
no
alarm
,
no
longing
;
so
that
the
question
whether
she
believe
it
have
not
occur
to
her
any
more
than
it
have
occur
to
her
to
inquire
into
the
condition
of
colonial
property
and
banking
,
on
which
,
as
she
have
have
many
opportunity
of
know
,
the
family
fortune
be
dependent
.
<EOS>
all
these
fact
about
herself
<EOS>
she
would
have
be
ready
to
admit
,
and
even
,
more
or
less
indirectly
,
to
state
.
<EOS>
what
she
unwillingly
recognize
,
and
would
have
be
glad
for
other
to
be
unaware
of
,
be
that
liability
of
her
to
fit
of
spiritual
dread
,
though
this
fountain
of
awe
within
her
have
not
find
its
way
into
connection
with
the
religion
teach
her
or
with
any
human
relation
.
<EOS>
She
be
ashamed
and
frightened
,
as
at
what
may
happen
again
,
in
remember
her
tremor
on
suddenly
feel
herself
alone
,
when
,
for
example
,
she
be
walk
without
companionship
and
there
come
some
rapid
change
in
the
light
.
<EOS>
Solitude
in
any
wide
scene
impress
her
with
an
undefined
feeling
of
immeasurable
existence
aloof
from
her
,
in
the
midst
of
which
she
be
helplessly
incapable
of
assert
herself
.
<EOS>
the
little
astronomy
teach
her
at
school
use
sometimes
to
set
her
imagination
at
work
in
a
way
that
make
her
tremble
:
but
always
when
some
one
join
her
she
recover
her
indifference
to
the
vastness
in
which
she
seem
an
exile
;
she
find
again
her
usual
world
in
which
her
will
be
of
some
avail
,
and
<EOS>
the
religious
nomenclature
belong
to
this
world
be
no
more
identified
for
her
with
those
uneasy
impression
of
awe
than
her
uncle
's
surplice
see
out
of
use
at
the
rectory
.
<EOS>
with
human
ear
and
eye
about
her
,
she
have
always
hitherto
recover
her
confidence
,
and
feel
the
possibility
of
win
empire
.
  
<EOS>
to
her
mamma
and
other
<EOS>
her
fit
of
timidity
or
terror
be
sufficiently
account
for
by
her
"
sensitiveness
"
or
the
"
excitability
of
her
nature
"
;
but
these
explanatory
phrase
require
conciliation
with
much
that
seem
to
be
blank
indifference
or
rare
self
-
mastery
.
<EOS>
heat
be
a
great
agent
and
a
useful
word
,
but
consider
as
a
means
of
explain
the
universe
it
require
an
extensive
knowledge
of
difference
;
and
as
a
means
of
explain
character
"
sensitiveness
"
be
in
much
the
same
predicament
.
<EOS>
but
who
,
love
a
creature
like
Gwendolen
,
would
not
be
incline
to
regard
every
peculiarity
in
her
as
a
mark
of
preeminence
?
<EOS>
that
be
what
Rex
do

<EOS>
after
the
Hermione
scene
he

that
she

be
instinct
with
all
feeling

not

ready

respond

a
worshipful
love

able

for

he

be
a
mystery
,
and
who
,
for
anything
Anna
know
,
may
have
an
appetite
for
devour
all
the
small
creature
that
be
her
own
particular
pet
.
<EOS>
and
now
Anna
's
heart
be
sink
under
the
heavy
conviction
which
she
dare
not
utter
,
that
Gwendolen
would
never
care
for
Rex
.
<EOS>
what
she
herself
hold
in
tenderness
and
reverence
have
constantly
seem
indifferent
to
Gwendolen
,
and
it
be
easy
to
imagine
her
scorning
Rex
than
return
any
tenderness
of
his
.
<EOS>
besides
,
she
be
always
think
of
be
something
extraordinary
.
<EOS>
and
poor
Rex
!
Papa
would
be
angry
with
him
if
he
know
.
<EOS>
and
of
course
he
be
too
young
to
be
in
love
in
that
way
;
and
she
,
Anna
have
think
that
it
would
be
year
and
year
before
any
thing
of
that
sort
come
,
and
that
she
would
be
Rex
's
housekeeper
ever
so
long
.
<EOS>
but
what
a
heart
must
that
be
which
do
not
return
his
love
!
<EOS>
Anna
,
in
the
prospect
of
his
suffering
,
be
begin
to
dislike
her
too
fascinating
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
to
her
,
as
it
do
to
Rex
,
that
the
week
have
be
fill
with
a
tumultuous
life
evident
to
all
observer
:
if
he
have
be
question
on
the
subject
he
would
have
say
that
he
have
no
wish
to
conceal
what
he
hope
would
be
an
engagement
which
he
should
immediately
tell
his
father
of
:
and
yet
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
be
reserve
not
only
about
his
feeling
but
 
which
be
more
remarkable
to
Anna
 
about
certain
action
.
<EOS>
She
,
on
her
side
,
be
nervous
each
time
her
father
or
mother
begin
to
speak
to
her
in
private
lest
they
should
say
anything
about
Rex
and
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
but
the
elder
be
not
in
the
least
alive
to
this
agitate
drama
,
which
go
forward
chiefly
in
a
sort
of
pantomime
extremely
lucid
in
the
mind
thus
express
themselves
,
but
easily
miss
by
spectator
who
be
run
their
eye
over
the
_
Guardian
_
or
the
_
Clerical
Gazette
_
,
and
regard
the
triviality
of
the
young
one
with
scarcely
more
interpretation
than
they
give
to
the
action
of
lively
ant
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
you
go
,
Rex
?
"
say
Anna
one
gray
morning
when
her
father
have
set
off
in
his
carriage
to
the
session
,
Mrs.
Gascoigne

him
,
and
<EOS>
she
have
observe
that
her

possess
to
a
hunting

Barns

She

"
not

"
You

He

Anna
,
whose
fear

with
second

<EOS>
"
why
not

"

Rex
,
smile
rather
provokingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
papa
and
mamma
and
aunt
Davilow
all
wish
her
not

<EOS>
They
think
it
be
not
right
for
her

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
you
suppose
she
be
go
to
do
what
be
not
right

"
  
<EOS>
"
gwendolen
mind
nobody
sometimes
,
"
say
Anna
get
bold
by
dint
of
a
little
anger
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
she
would
not
mind
me
,
"
say
Rex
,
perversely
make
a
joke
of
poor
Anna
's
anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
Rex
,
I
can
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
You
will
make
yourself
very
unhappy
.
"
<EOS>
here
Anna
burst
into
tear
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nannie
,
Nannie
,
what
on
earth
be
the
matter
with
you
?
"
say
Rex
,
a
little
impatient
at
be
keep
in
this
way
,
hat
on
and
whip
in
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
not
care
for
you
one
bit
 
<EOS>
I
know
she
never
will
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
poor
child
in
a
sob
whisper
.
<EOS>
She
have
lose
all
control
of
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Rex
redden
and
hurry
away
from
her
out
of
the
hall
door
,
leave
her
to
the
miserable
consciousness
of
have
make
herself
disagreeable
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
think
of
her
word
as
he
ride
along
;
they
have
the
unwelcomeness
which
all
unfavorable
fortune
-
telling
have
,
even
when
laugh
at
;
but
he
quickly
explain
them
as
spring
from
little
Anna
's
tenderness
,
and
begin
to
be
sorry
that
he
be
oblige
to
come
away
without
soothe
her
.
<EOS>
every
other
feeling
on
the
subject
,
however
,
be
quickly
merge
in
a
resistant
belief
to
the
contrary
of
her
,
accompany
with
a
new
determination
to
prove
that
he
be
right
.
<EOS>
this
sort
of
certainty
have
just
enough
kinship
to
doubt
and
uneasiness
to
hurry
on
a
confession
which
an
untouched
security
may
have
delay
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
be
already
mount
and
ride
up
and
down
the
avenue
when
Rex
appear
at
the
gate
.
<EOS>
She
have
provide
herself
against
disappointment
in
case
he
do
not
appear
in
time
by
have
the
groom
ready
behind
her
,
for
she
would
not
have
wait
beyond
a
reasonable
time
.
<EOS>
but
now
the
groom
be
dismiss
,
and
the
two
ride
away
in
delightful
freedom
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
be
in
her
high
spirit
,
and
Rex
think
that
she
have
never
look
so
lovely
before
;
her
figure
,
her
long
white
throat
,
and
the
curve
of
her
cheek
and
chin
be
always
set
off
to
perfection
by
the
compact
simplicity
of
her
ride
dress
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
conceive
a
more
perfect
girl
;
and
to
a
youthful
lover
like
Rex
<EOS>
it
seem
that
the
fundamental
identity
of
the
good
,
the
true
and
the
beautiful
,
be
already
extant
and
manifest
in
the
object
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
Most
observer
would
have
hold
it
more
than
equally
accountable
that
a
girl
should
have
like
impression
about
Rex
,
for
in
his
handsome
face
there
be
nothing
correspond
to
the
undefinable
stinging
quality
 
as
it
be
a
trace
of
demon
ancestry
 
which
make
some
beholder
hesitate
in
their
admiration
of
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
an
exquisite
January
morning
in
which
there
be
no
threat
of
rain
,
but
a
gray
sky
make
the
calm
background
for
the
charm
of
a
mild
winter
scene
 
<EOS>
the
grassy
border
of
the
lane
<EOS>
,
the
hedgerow
sprinkle
with
red
berry
and
haunt
with
low
twittering
,
the
purple
bareness
of
the
elm
,
the
rich
brown
of
the
furrow
.
<EOS>
the
horse
'
hoofs
make
a
musical
chime
,
accompany
their
young
voice
.
<EOS>
She
be
laugh
at
his
equipment
,
for
he
be
the
reverse
of
a
dandy
,
and
he
be
enjoy
her
laughter
;
the
freshness
of
the
morning
mingle
with
the
freshness
of
their
youth
;
and
every
sound
that
come
from
their
clear
throat
,
every
glance
they
give
each
other
,
be
the
bubbling
outflow
from
a
spring
of
joy
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
morning
to
them
,
within
and
without
.
<EOS>
and
think
of
them
in
these
moment
one
be
tempt
to
that
futile
sort
of
wish
 
<EOS>
if
only
thing
could
have
be
a
little
otherwise
then
,
so
as
to
have
be
greatly
otherwise
after
 
if
only
these
two
beautiful
young
creature
could
have
pledge
themselves
to
each
other
then
and
there
,
and
never
through
life
have
swerve
from
that
pledge
!
<EOS>
for
some
of
the
goodness
which
Rex
believe
in
be
there
.
<EOS>
goodness
be
a
large
,
often
a
prospective
word
;
like
harvest
,
which
at
one
stage
when
we
talk
of
it
lie
all
underground
,
with
an
indeterminate
future
;
be
the
germ
prosper
in
the
darkness
?
<EOS>
at
another
,
it
have
put
forth
delicate
green
blade
,
and
by
-
and
-
by
<EOS>
the
tremble
blossom
be
ready
to
be
dash
off
by
an
hour
of
rough
wind
or
rain
.
<EOS>
each
stage
have
its
peculiar
blight
,
and
may
have
the
healthy
life
choke
out
of
it
by
a
particular
action
of
the
foul
land
which
rear
or
neighbor
it
,
or
by
damage
bring
from
foulness
afar
.
  
<EOS>
"
Anna
have
get
it
into
her
head
that
you
would
want
to
ride
after
the
hound
this
morning
,
"
say
Rex
,
whose
secret
association
with
Anna
's
word
make
this
speech
seem
quite
perilously
near
the
most
momentous
of
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
she
?
"
say
Gwendolen
,
laughingly
.
<EOS>
"
what
a
little
clairvoyant
she
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
you
?
"
say
Rex
,
who
have
not
believe
in
her
intending
to
do
it
if
the
elder
object
,
but
confide
in
her
have
good
reason

"
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
what
I
shall
do
till
I
get
there
.
<EOS>
clairvoyant
be
often
wrong
:
they
foresee
what
be
likely
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
fond
of
what
be
likely
:
it
be
always
dull

<EOS>
I
do
what
be
unlikely

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
there
you
tell
me
a
secret
.
<EOS>
when
once
I
know
what
people
in
general
would
be
likely
to
do
,
I
should
know
you
would
do
the
opposite
.
<EOS>
so
you
would
have
come
round
to
a
likelihood
of
your
own
sort
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
able
to
calculate
on
you
.
<EOS>
You
could
not
surprise
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
could
.
<EOS>
I
should
turn
round
and
do
what
be
likely
for
people
in
general
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
with
a
musical
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
you
can
not
escape
some
sort
of
likelihood
.
<EOS>
and
contradictoriness
make
the
strong
likelihood
of
all
.
<EOS>
You
must
give
up
a
plan

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
shall
not

<EOS>
My
plan
be
to
do
what
please
me

"
<EOS>
(
here
should
any
young
lady
incline
to
imitate
Gwendolen
<EOS>
,
let
her
consider
the
set
of
her
head
and
neck
:
if
the
angle
there
have
be
different
,
the
chin
protrusive
,
and
the
cervical
vertebrae
a
trifle
more
curved
in
their
position
,
ten
to
one
Gwendolen
's
word
would
have
have
a
jar
in
them
for
the
sweet
-
natured
Rex
.
<EOS>
but
everything
odd
in
her
speech
be
humor
and
pretty
banter
,
which
he
be
only
anxious
to
turn
toward
one
point
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
manage
to
feel
only
what
please
you
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
not
;
that
come
from
what
other
people
do

<EOS>
but
if
the
world
be
pleasanter
,
one
would
only
feel
what
be
pleasant

<EOS>
girl
'
life
be
so
stupid
:
they
never
do
what
they
like

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
be
more
the
case
of
the
man

<EOS>
They
be
force
to
do
hard
thing
,
and
be
often
dreadfully
bore
,
and
knock
to
piece
too
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
if
we
love
a
girl
very
dearly
we
want
to
do
as
she
like
,
so
after
all
you
have
your
own
way

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

it

<EOS>
I
never

a

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
should
you
like
to
do

Rex

quite
guilelessly

and
in
real
anxiety

<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
do
not

<EOS>
go
to
the
North
Pole

or
go
to

queen
in

East
like
Lady
Hester
Stanhope

"
say
Gwendolen
,
flightily
.
<EOS>
Her
word
be
bear
on
her
lip
,
but
she
would
have
be
at
a
loss
to
give
an
answer
of
deep
origin

<EOS>
"
You
do
not
mean
you

never

<EOS>
"
no

I
do
not

only
when
I

I

<EOS>
"
You
may
do
just
as
you
like

you

a
man
who
love
you
more
dearly
than
anything

"
say
Rex
,
who
,
poor
youth
,
be
move
in
theme
outside
the
curriculum
in
which
he
have
promise
to
win
distinction
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
one
who
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
talk
of
Mr.
Middleton
,
for
heaven
's
sake
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
hastily
,
a
quick
blush
spread
over
her
face
and
neck
;
"
that
be
Anna
's
chant
.
<EOS>
I
hear
the
hound
.
<EOS>
let
us
go
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
put
her
chestnut
to
a
canter
,
and
Rex
have
no
choice
but
to
follow
her
.
<EOS>
still
he
feel
encouraged
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
be
perfectly
aware
that
her
cousin
be
in
love
with
her
;
but
she
have
no
idea
that
the
matter
be
of
any
consequence
,
have
never
have
the
slight
visitation
of
painful
love
herself
.
<EOS>
She
wish
the
small
romance
of
Rex
's
devotion
to
fill
up
the
time
of
his
stay
at
Pennicote
,
and
to
avoid
explanation
which
would
bring
it
to
an
untimely
end
.
<EOS>
besides
,
she
object
,
with
a
sort
of
physical
repulsion
,
to
be
directly
make
love
to
.
<EOS>
with
all
her
imaginative
delight
in
be
adore
,
there
be
a
certain
fierceness
of
maidenhood
in
her
.
  
<EOS>
but
all
other
thought
be
soon
lose
for
her
in
the
excitement
of
the
scene
at
the
Three
Barns
.
<EOS>
several
gentleman
of
the
hunt
know
her
,
and
she
exchange
pleasant
greeting
.
<EOS>
Rex
could
not
get
another
word
with
her
.
<EOS>
the
color
,
the
stir
of
the
field
have
take
possession
of
Gwendolen
with
a
strength
which
be
not
due
to
habitual
association
,
for
she
have
never
yet
ride
after
the
hound
 
<EOS>
only
say
she
should
like
to
do
it
,
and
so
draw
forth
a
prohibition
;
<EOS>
her
mamma
dread
the
danger
,
and
her
uncle
declare
that
for
his
part
he
hold
that
kind
of
violent
exercise
unseemly
in
a
woman
,
and
that
whatever
may
be
do
in
other
part
of
the
country
,
no
lady
of
good
position
follow
the
Wessex
hunt
:
<EOS>
no
one
but
Mrs.
Gadsby
,
the
yeomanry
captain
's
wife
,
who
have
be
a
kitchenmaid
and
still
speak
like
one
.
<EOS>
this
last
argument
have
some
effect
on
Gwendolen
,
and
have
keep
her
halt
between
her
desire
to
assert
her
freedom
and
her
horror
of
be
class
with
Mrs.
Gadsby
.
  
<EOS>
some
of
the
most
unexceptionable
woman
in
the
neighborhood
occasionally
go
to
see
the
hound
throw
off
;
but
it
happen
that
none
of
them
be
present
this
morning
to
abstain
from
follow
,
while
Mrs.
Gadsby
,
with
her
doubtful
antecedent
,
grammatical
and
otherwise
,
be
not
visible
to
make
follow
seem
unbecoming
.
<EOS>
thus
Gwendolen
feel
no
check
on
the
animal
stimulus
that
come
from
the
stir
and
tongue
of
the
hound
,
the
pawing
of
the
horse
,
the
varying
voice
of
man
,
the
movement
hither
and
thither
of
vivid
color
on
the
background
of
green
and
gray
stillness
:
 
that
utmost
excitement
of
the
come
chase
which
consist
in
feel
something
like
a
combination
of
dog
and
horse
,
with
the
superadde
thrill
of
social
vanity
and
consciousness
of
centaur
-
power
which
belong
to
humankind
.
  
<EOS>
Rex
would
have
feel
more
of
the
same
enjoyment
if
he
could
have
keep
nearer
to
Gwendolen
,
and
not
see
her
constantly
occupy
with
acquaintance
,
or
look
at
by
would
-
be
acquaintance
,
all
on
lively
horse
which
veer
about
and
sweep
the
surround
space
as
effectually
as
a
revolving
lever
.
  
<EOS>
"
glad
to
see
you
here
this
fine
morning
,
Miss
Harleth
,
"
say
Lord
Brackenshaw
,
a
middle
-
aged
peer
of
aristocratic
seediness
in
stained
pink
,
with
easy
-
going
manner
which
would
have
make
the
threaten
deluge
seem
of
no

<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
a
first

rate
run

<EOS>
a
pity
you
do
not
go
with
us
.
<EOS>
have
you
ever
try
your
little
chestnut
at
a
ditch
?
<EOS>
you
would
not
be
afraid
,
eh
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
the
least
in
the
world
,
"
say
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
and
that
be
true
:
she
be
never
fearful
in
action
and
companionship
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
often
take
him
at
some
rail
and
a
ditch
too
,
near
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
by
Jove
!
"
say
his
lordship
,
quietly
,
in
notation
that
something
be
happen
which
must
break
off
the
dialogue
:
and
as
he
rein
off
his
horse
,
Rex
be
bring
his
sober
hackney
up
to
Gwendolen
's
side
when
 
the
hound
give
tongue
,
and
the
whole
field
be
in
motion
as
if
the
whirl
of
the
earth
be
carry
it
;
Gwendolen
along
with
everything
else
;
no
word
of
notice
to
Rex
,
who
without
a
second
thought
follow
too
.
<EOS>
Could
he
let
Gwendolen
go
alone
?
<EOS>
under
other
circumstance
he
would
have
enjoy
the
run
,
but
he
be
just
now
perturb
by
the
check
which
have
be
put
on
the
impetus
to
utter
his
love
,
and
get
utterance
in
return
,
an
impetus
which
could
not
at
once
resolve
itself
into
a
totally
different
sort
of
chase
,
at
least
with
the
consciousness
of
be
on
his
father
's
gray
nag
,
a
good
horse
enough
in
his
way
,
but
of
sober
year
and
ecclesiastical
habit
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
on
her
spirited
little
chestnut
be
up
with
the
good
,
and
feel
as
secure
as
an
immortal
goddess
,
have
,
if
she
have
think
of
risk
,
a
core
of
confidence
that
no
ill
luck
would
happen
to
her
.
<EOS>
but
she
think
of
no
such
thing
,
and
certainly
not
of
any
risk
there
may
be
for
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
if
she
have
think
of
him
,
it
would
have
strike
her
as
a
droll
picture
that
he
should
be
gradually
fall
behind
,
and
look
round
in
search
of
gate
:
<EOS>
a
fine
lithe
youth
,
whose
heart
must
be
pant
with
all
the
spirit
of
a
beagle
,
stick
as
if
under
a
wizard
's
spell
on
a
stiff
clerical
hackney
,
would
have
make
her
laugh
with
a
sense
of
fun
much
too
strong
for
her
to
reflect
on
his
mortification
.
<EOS>
but
Gwendolen
be
apt
to
think
rather
of
those
who
see
her
than
of
those
whom
she
could
not
see
;
and
Rex
be
soon
so
far
behind
that
if
she
have
look
she
would
not
have
see
him
.
<EOS>
for
I
grieve
to
say
that
in
the
search
for
a
gate
,
along
a
lane
lately
mend
,
Primrose
fall
,
break
his
knee
,
and
undesignedly
throw
Rex
over
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
fortunately
a
blacksmith
's
son
who
also
follow
the
hound
under
disadvantage
,
namely
,
on
foot
(
a
loose
way
of
hunting
which
have
strike
some
even
frivolous
mind
as
immoral
)
,
be
naturally
also
in
the

and
happen
to
be

of
Rex

<EOS>
He

to
give
help
which
be
greatly
need
,
for
Rex
be
a

the

<EOS>
Joel

occasion

himself
that

useful

with

how
far
they
be
both
from

from
Pennicote

also

experienced
surgical

happily

not

to

more
of
him

that

<EOS>
there
be
no
alternative

to

though
all
the

he
be
in
anxiety
about
Gwendolen

more
miserable
in
the
thought
that
she
,
too
,
may
have
have
an
accident

than
in
the
pain
of
his

bruise

the
annoyance
he

about

<EOS>
He
comfort

about

distressed

<EOS>
He
be
secretly
the

however

never

with

<EOS>
Mr.

answer
at

with
a
blush

which
be

nervously

lead
away

<EOS>
Mr.

leave
a
brief
interval
of
silence

and
then
say
,
with
quiet
irony
,
 
"
but
now
you
observe

young

that

You
must
give

You

here
Rex
bite
his

He

an
intention
fatal

<EOS>
He

to
expect
firmness

Father

I

really
sorry

every
consideration

wise
tactic

<EOS>
He
have
quickly
make
up

quietly
    
<EOS>
"
My

you
be
too
young

momentous

decisive
step

<EOS>
this
be
a
fancy
which
you
have
get
into
your
head
during
an
idle
week
or
two
:
you
must
set
to
work
at
something
and
dismiss
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
every
reason
against
it
.
<EOS>
an
engagement
at
your
age
would
be
totally
rash
and
unjustifiable
;
and
moreover
,
alliance
between
first
cousin
be
undesirable

<EOS>
make
up
your
mind
to
a
brief
disappointment

<EOS>
life

full
of
them

<EOS>
We
have
all

break
in

mild
beginning
for
you

<EOS>
"
no

not
mild

<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
it

<EOS>
I
shall

good

<EOS>
I
should
not

anything

if
it

<EOS>
I
could
do
anything
then

say
Rex

impetuously
.
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
of
no
use
to
pretend
that
I
will
obey
you

<EOS>
I
can
not

it

<EOS>
if
I
say
I
would

I
should
be

break
my

I

me
that

Mr.

quietly

Rex

could
not

<EOS>
the

her
home
,
and
have
show
himself
delighted
with
her
spirited
ride
.
<EOS>
all
this
be
tell
at
once
to
her
uncle
,
that
he
may
see
how
well
justified
she
have
be
in
act
against
his
advice
;
and
the
prudential
rector
do
feel
himself
in
a
slight
difficulty
,
for
at
that
moment
he
be
particularly
sensible
that
it
be
his
niece
's
serious
interest
to
be
well
regard
by
the
Brackenshaws
,
and
their
opinion
as
to
her
follow
the
hound
really
touch
the
essence
of
his
objection
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
be
not
oblige
to
say
anything
immediately
,
for
Mrs.
Davilow
follow
up
Gwendolen
's
brief
triumphant
phrase
with
    
<EOS>
"
still
,
I
do
hope
you
will
not
do
it
again
,
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
I
should
never
have
a
moment
's
quiet
.
<EOS>
Her
father
die
by
an
accident
,
you
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
Mrs.
Davilow
have
turn
away
from
Gwendolen
,
and
look
at
Mr.
Gascoigne
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mamma
,
dear
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
kiss
her
merrily
,
and
pass
over
the
question
of
the
fear
which
Mrs.
Davilow
have
mean
to
account
for
,
"
child
do
not
take
after
their
parent
in
broken
leg
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
not
one
word
have
yet
be
say
about
Rex
.
<EOS>
in
fact
there
have
be
no
anxiety
about
him
at
Offendene
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
have
observe
to
her
mamma
,
"
oh
,
he
must
have
be
leave
far
behind
,
and
go
home
in
despair
,
"
and
it
could
not
be
deny
that
this
be
fortunate
so
far
as
it
make
way
for
Lord
Brackenshaw
's
bring
her
home
.
<EOS>
but
now
Mr.
Gascoigne
say
,
with
some
emphasis
,
look
at
Gwendolen
    
<EOS>
"
well
,
the
exploit
have
end
better
for
you
than
for
Rex
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
dare
say
he
have
to
make
a
terrible
round
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
teach
Primrose
to
take
the
fence
,
uncle
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
without
the
faint
shade
of
alarm
in
her
look
and
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rex
have
have
a
fall
,
"
say
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
curtly
,
throw
himself
into
an
arm
-
chair
rest
his
elbow
and
fit
his
palm
and
finger
together
,
while
he
close
his
lip
and
look
at
Gwendolen
,
who
say
    
"
<EOS>
oh
,
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
he
be
not
hurt
,
I
hope
?
"
<EOS>
with
a
correct
look
of
anxiety
such
as
elated
mortal
try
to
super
-
induce
when
their
pulse
be
all
the
while
quick
with
triumph
;
and
Mrs.
Davilow
,
in
the
same
moment
,
utter
a
low
"
good
heaven
!
<EOS>
there
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
go
on
:
"
He
put
his
shoulder
out
,
and
get
some
bruise
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
here
he
make
another
little
pause
of
observation
;
but
Gwendolen
,
instead
of
any
such
symptom
as
pallor
and
silence
,
have
only
deepen
the
compassionateness
of
her
brow
and
eye
,
and
say
again
,
"
oh
,
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
it
be
nothing
serious
,
then
?
"
and
Mr.
Gascoigne
hold
his
diagnosis
complete
.
<EOS>
but
he
wish
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
,
and
go
on
still
with
a
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
get
his
arm
set
again
rather
oddly
.
<EOS>
some
blacksmith
 
<EOS>
not
a
parishioner
of
mine
 
be
on
the
field
 
<EOS>
a
loose
fish
,
I
suppose
,
but
handy
,
and
set
the
arm
for
him
immediately
.
<EOS>
so
after
all
,
I
believe
,
I
and
Primrose
come
off
worst
.
<EOS>
the
horse
's
knee
be
cut
to
piece
.
<EOS>
He
come
down
in
a
hole
,
it
seem
,
and
pitch
Rex
over
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
face
have
allowably
become
contented
again
,
since
Rex
's
arm
have
be
reset
;
and
now
,
at
the
descriptive
suggestion
in
the
latter
part
of
her
uncle
's
speech
,
her
elated
spirit
make
her
feature
less
unmanageable
than
usual
;
the
smile
break
forth
,
and
finally
a
descend
scale
of
laughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
pretty
young
lady
 
to
laugh
at
other
people
's
calamity
,
"
say
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
with
a
milder
sense
of
disapprobation
than
if
he
have
not
have
counteract
reason
to
be
glad
that
Gwendolen
show
no
deep
feeling
on
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
pray
forgive
me
,
uncle
.
<EOS>
now
Rex
be
safe
,
it
be
so
droll
to
fancy
the
figure
he
and
Primrose
would
cut
 
in
a
lane
all
by
themselves
 
only
a
blacksmith
run
up
.
<EOS>
It
would
make
a
capital
caricature
of
"
follow
the
hound
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
Gwendolen
rather
value
herself
on
her
superior
freedom
in
laugh
where
other
may
only
see
matter
for
seriousness
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
laughter
become
her
person
so
well
that
her
opinion
of
its
gracefulness
be
often
share
by
other
;
and
it
even
enter
into
her
uncle
's
course
of
thought
at
this
moment
,
that
it
be
no
wonder
a
boy
should
be
fascinate
by
this
young
witch
 
who
,
however
,
be
more
mischievous
than
could
be
desire
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
you
laugh
at
broken
bone
,
child
?
"
say
Mrs.
Davilow
,
still
under
her
dominant
anxiety
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
we
have
never
allow
you
to
have
the
horse
.
<EOS>
You
will
see
that
we
be
wrong
,
"
she
add
,
look
with
a
grave
nod
at
Mr.
Gascoigne
 
"
at
least
I
be
,
to
encourage
her
in
ask
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
seriously
,
Gwendolen
,
"
say
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
in
a
judicious
tone
of
rational
advice
to
a
person
understand
to
be
altogether
rational
,
"
I
strongly
recommend
you
 
<EOS>
I
shall
ask
you
to
oblige
me
so
far
 
not
to
repeat
your
adventure
of
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brackenshaw
be
very
kind
,
but
I
feel
sure
that
he
would
concur
with
me
in
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
to
be
speak
of
as
'
the
young
lady
who
hunt
'
by
way
of
exception
,
would
give
a
tone
to
the
language
about
you
which
I
be
sure
you
would
not
like
.
<EOS>
depend
upon
it
,
his
lordship
would
not
choose
that
Lady
Beatrice
or
Lady
Maria
should
hunt
in
this
part
of
the
country
,
if
they
be
old
enough
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
when
you
be
married
,
it
will
be
different
:
you
may
do
whatever
your
husband
sanction
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
intend
to
hunt
,
you
must
marry
a
man
who
can
keep
horse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
why
I
should
do
anything
so
horrible
as
to
marry
without
_
that
_
prospect
,
at
least
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
pettishly
.
<EOS>
Her
uncle
's
speech
have
give
her
annoyance
,
which
she
could
not
show
more
directly
;
but
she
feel
that
she
be
commit
herself
,
and
after
move
carelessly
to
another
part
of
the
room
,
go
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
always
speak
in
that
way
about
marriage
,
"
say
Mrs.
Davilow
;
"
but
it
will
be
different
when
she
have
see
the
right
person
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Her
heart
have
never
be
in
the
least
<EOS>
touched
,
that
you
know
of
?
"
say
Mr.
Gascoigne
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
shake
her
head
silently
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
only
last
night
she
say
to
me
,
"
Mamma
,
I
wonder
how
girl
manage
to
fall
in
love
.
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
make
them
do
it
in
book
.
<EOS>
but
man
be
too
ridiculous
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
laugh
a
little
,
and
make
no
further
remark
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
he
say
    
"
how
be
your
bruise
,
Rex
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
not
very
mellow
yet
,
sir
;
only
begin
to
turn
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
feel
quite
ready
for
a
journey
to
Southampton
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
quite
,
"
answer
Rex
,
with
his
heart
metaphorically
in
his
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
you
can
wait
till
to
-
morrow
,
and
go
to
say
goodbye
to
them
at
Offendene
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Gascoigne
,
who
now
know
the
whole
affair
,
look
steadily
at
her
coffee
lest
she
also
should
begin
to
cry
,
as
Anna
be
do
already
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
feel
that
he
be
apply
a
sharp
remedy
to
poor
Rex
's
acute
attack
,
but
he
believe
it
to
be
in
the
end
the
kind
.
<EOS>
to
let
him
know
the
hopelessness
of
his
love
from
Gwendolen
's
own
lip
may
be
curative
in
more
way
than
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
be
thankful
that
she
do
not
care
about
him
,
"
say
Mrs.
Gascoigne
,
when
she
join
her
husband
in
his
study
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
thing
in
Gwendolen
<EOS>
I
can
not
reconcile
myself
to
.
<EOS>
My
Anna
be
worth
two
of
her
,
with
all
her
beauty
and
talent
.
<EOS>
It
look
very
ill
in
her
that
she
will
not
help
in
the
school
with
Anna
 
not
even
in
the
Sunday
-
school
.
<EOS>
what
you
or
I
advise
be
of
no
consequence
to
her
:
and
poor
Fannie
be
completely
under
her
thumb
.
<EOS>
but
I
know
you
think
better
of
her
,
"
Mrs.
Gascoigne
end
with
a
deferential
hesitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
my
dear
,
there
be
no
harm
in
the
girl
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
that
she
have
a
high
spirit
,
and
it
will
not
do
to
hold
the
rein
too
tight
.
<EOS>
the
point
be
,
to
get
her
well
married
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
little
too
much
fire
in
her
for
her
present
life
with
her
mother
and
sister
.
<EOS>
It
be
natural
and
right
that
she
should
be
marry
soon
 
not
to
a
poor
man
,
but
one
who
can
give
her
a
fitting
position
.
"
  
<EOS>
presently
Rex
,
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
,
be
on
his
two
mile
'
walk
to
Offendene
.
<EOS>
He
be
rather
puzzle
by
the
unconditional
permission
to
see
Gwendolen
,
but
his
father
's
real
ground
of
action
could
not
enter
into
his
conjecture
.
<EOS>
if
it
have
,
he
would
first
have
think
it
horribly
cold
-
blooded
,
and
then
have
disbelieve
in
his
father
's
conclusion
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
get
to
the
house
,
everybody
be
there
but
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
the
four
girl
,
hear
him
speak
in
the
hall
,
rush
out
of
the
library
,
which
be
their
school
-
room
,
and
hang
round
him
with
compassionate
inquiry
about
his
arm
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
want
to
know
exactly
what
have
happen
,
and
where
the
blacksmith
live
,
that
she
may
make
him
a
present
;
while
Miss
Merry
,
who
take
a
subdued
and
melancholy
part
in
all
family
affair
,
doubt
whether
it
would
not
be
give
too
much
encouragement
to
that
kind
of
character
.
<EOS>
Rex
have
never
find
the
family
troublesome
before
,
but
just
now
he
wish
them
all
away
and
Gwendolen
there
,
and
he
be
too
uneasy
for
good
-
natured
feigning
.
<EOS>
when
at
last
he
have
say
,
"
where
be
gwendolen
?
"
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Davilow
have
tell
Alice
to
go
and
see
if
her
sister
be
come
down
,
add
,
"
I
send
up
her
breakfast
this
morning
.
<EOS>
She
need
a
long
rest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Rex
take
the
short
way
out
of
his
endurance
by
say
,
almost
impatiently
,
"
Aunt
,
I
want
to
speak
to
Gwendolen
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
her
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
dear
;
go
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
I
will
send
her
there
,
"
say
Mrs.
Davilow
,
who
have
observe
that
he
be
fond
of
be
with
Gwendolen
,
as
be
natural
,
but
have
not
think
of
this
as
have
any
bearing
on
the
reality
of
life
<EOS>
:
it
seem
merely
part
of
the
Christmas
holiday
which
be
spin
themselves
out
.
  
<EOS>
Rex
for
his
part
think
that
the
reality
of
life
be
all
hang
on
this
interview
.
<EOS>
He
have
to
walk
up
and
down
the
drawing
-
room
in
expectation
for
nearly
ten
minute
 
ample
space
for
all
imaginative
fluctuation
;
yet
,
strange
to
say
,
he
be
unvaryingly
occupy
in
think
what
and
how
much
he
could
do
,
when
Gwendolen
have
accept
him
,
to
satisfy
his
father
that
the
engagement
be
the
most
prudent
thing
in
the
world
,
since
it
inspire
him
with
double
energy
for
work
.
<EOS>
He
be
to
be
a
lawyer
,
and
what
reason
be
there
why
he
should
not
rise
as
high
as
Eldon
do
?
<EOS>
He
be
force
to
look
at
life
in
the
light
of
his
father
's
mind
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
the
door
open
and
she
whose
presence
he
be
long
for
enter
,
there
come
over
him
suddenly
and
mysteriously
a
state
of
tremor
and
distrust
which
he
have
never
feel
before
.
<EOS>
Miss
Gwendolen
,
simple
as
she
stand
there
,
in
her
black
silk
,
cut
square
about
the
round
white
pillar
of
her
throat
,
a
black
band
fasten
her
hair
which
stream
backward
in
smooth
silky
abundance
,
seem
more
queenly
than
usual
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
that
there
be
none
of
the
latent
fun
and
tricksiness
which
have
always
pierce
in
her
greeting
of
Rex
.
<EOS>
how
much
of
this
be
due
to
her
presentiment
from
what
he
have
say
yesterday
that
he
be
go
to
talk
of
love
?
<EOS>
how
much
from
her
desire
to
show
regret
about
his
accident
?
<EOS>
something
of
both
.
<EOS>
but
the
wisdom
of
age
have
hint
that
there
be
a
side
of
the
bed
which
have
a
malign
influence
if
you
happen
to
get
out
on
it
;
and
this
accident
befall
some
charming
person
rather
frequently
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
have
befall
Gwendolen
this
morning
.
<EOS>
the
hastening
of
her
toilet
,
the
way
in
which
Bugle
use
the
brush
,
the
quality
of
the
shill
serial
mistakenly
write
for
her
amusement
,
the
probability
of
the
come
day
,
and
,
in
short
,
social
institution
generally
,
be
all
objectionable
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
she
be
out
of
temper
,
but
that
the
world
be
not
equal
to
the
demand
of
her
fine

<EOS>
however
it
may
be
,
Rex
see
an
awful
majesty
about
her
as
she
enter
and
put
out
her
hand
to
him
,
without
the
least
approach
to
a
smile
in
eye
or
mouth
.
<EOS>
the
fun
which
have
move
her
in
the
evening
have
quite
evaporate
from
the
image
of
his
accident
,
and
the
whole
affair
seem
stupid
to
her
.
<EOS>
but
she
say
with
perfect
propriety
,
"
I
hope
you
be
not
much
hurt
,
Rex
;
I
deserve
that
you
should
reproach
me
for
your
accident

<EOS>
"
  
"
not
at
all

say
Rex
,
feel
the
soul
within
him
spread
itself
like
an
attack
of
illness
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
hardly
any
thing
the
matter
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
glad
you
have
the
pleasure
:
I
would
willingly
pay
for
it
by
a
tumble
,
only
I
be
sorry
to
break
the
horse
's
knee

"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
walk
to
the
hearth
and
stand
look
at
the
fire
in
the
most
inconvenient
way
for
conversation
,
so
that
he
could
only
get
a
side
view
of
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
want
me
to
go
to
Southampton
for
the
rest
of
the
vacation

"
say
Rex
,
his
baritone
tremble
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
Southampton
!
<EOS>
that
be
a
stupid
place
to
go
to

be
not
it

"
say
Gwendolen
,
chilly
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
to
me

because
you

<EOS>
silence

<EOS>
"
Should
you
mind
about

go
away

Gwendolen

"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course

<EOS>
every
one
be
of
consequence
in
this
dreary
country
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
curtly
.
<EOS>
the
perception
that
poor
Rex
want
to
be
tender
make
her
curl
up
and
harden
like
a
sea
-
anemone
at
the
touch
of
a
finger
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
angry
with
me
,
Gwendolen

<EOS>
why
do
you
treat
me
in
this
way
all
at
once

"
say
Rex
,
flush
,
and
with
more
spirit
in
his
voice
,
as
if
he
too
be
capable
of
be
angry
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
look
round
at
him
and
smile
.
<EOS>
"
treat
you
?
<EOS>
nonsense
!
<EOS>
I
be
only
rather
cross
.
<EOS>
why
do
you
come
so
very
early
?
<EOS>
You
must
expect
to
find
temper
in
dishabille

<EOS>
"
  
"
be
as
cross
with
me
as
you
like
 
only
do
not

me
with
indifference

Rex
,
imploringly
.
<EOS>
"
all
the
happiness
of
my

on
your

if
only
a
little
 
better

"
  
<EOS>
He
try
to
take
her
hand
,
but
she
hastily
elude
his
grasp
and
move
to
the
other
end
of
the
hearth
,
face
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
pray
do
not
make
love
to
me

<EOS>
I
hate
it

"
<EOS>
she
look
at
him
fiercely
.
  
<EOS>
Rex
turn
pale
and
be
silent
,
but
could
not
take
his
eye
off
her
,
and
the
impetus
be
not
yet
exhaust
that
make
hers
dart
death
at
him
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
herself
could
not
have
foresee
that
she
should
feel
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
a
sudden
,
new
experience
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
day
before
she
have
be
quite
aware
that
her
cousin
be
in
love
with
her
;
she
do
not
mind
how
much
,
so
that
he
say
nothing
about
it
;
and
if
any
one
have
ask
her
why
she
object
to
love
-
make
speech
,
she
would
have
say
,
laughingly
,
"
<EOS>
oh
I
be
tired
of
them
all
in
the
book
.
<EOS>
"
but
now
the
life
of
passion
have
begin
negatively
in
her
.
<EOS>
She
feel
passionately
averse
to
this
volunteer
love
.
  
<EOS>
to
Rex
at
twenty
the
joy
of
life
seem
at
an
end
more
absolutely
than
it
can
do
to
a
man
at
forty
.
<EOS>
but
before
they
have
cease
to
look
at
each
other
,
he
do
speak
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
that
last
word
you
have
to
say
to
me
,
Gwendolen
?
<EOS>
Will
it
always
be
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
help
see
his
wretchedness
and
feel
a
little
regret
for
the
old
Rex
who
have
not
offend
her
.
<EOS>
decisively
,
<EOS>
but
yet
with
some
return
of
kindness
,
she
say
    
"
about
make
love
?
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
dislike
you
for
anything
else

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
just
a
perceptible
pause
before
he
say
a
low
"
good
-
bye

"
and
pass
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
almost
immediately
after
,
she
hear
the
heavy
hall
door
bang
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.

,
too
,
have
hear
Rex

hasty
departure

and
presently
come
into
the
drawing

room

where
she
find
Gwendolen
seat
on
the
low
couch
,
her
face
bury
,
and
her
hair
fall
over
her
figure
like
a
garment

She
be
sob
bitterly

<EOS>
"

the
mother

down
in
this
way

feel
something
of
the
alarm
anguish
that

overpower
sorrow
in

strong
man

<EOS>
sit
down
by
her
with
circle
arm
,
she
press
her
cheek
against
Gwendolen
's
head
,
and
then
try
to
draw
it
upward
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
give
way
,
and
let
her
head
rest
against
her
mother
,
cry
out
sobbingly
,
"
oh
,
mamma
,
what
can
become
of
my
life
?
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
worth
live
for

"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
dear

"
say
Mrs.
Davilow
.
<EOS>
usually
she
herself
have
be
rebuke
by
her
daughter
for
involuntary
sign
of
despair
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
love
anybody

I

I

"
the
time

<EOS>
Gwendolen
be
more
and
more
convulsed
with
sob
;
but
put
her
arm
round
her
mother
's
neck
with
an
almost
painful
clinging
,
she
say
brokenly
,
"
I
can
not
bear
any
one
to
be
very
near
me
but
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
then
the
mother
begin
to
sob
,
for
this
spoiled
child
have
never
show
such
dependence
on
her
before
:
and
so
they
cling
to
each
other
.
      
<EOS>
what
name
doth
Joy
most
borrow
  
when
life

fair

"
to

morrow

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
much
more
lasting
trouble
at
the
rectory
.
<EOS>
Rex
arrive
there
only
to
throw
himself
on
his
bed
in
a
state
of
apparent
apathy
,
unbroken
till
the
next
day
,
when
it
begin
to
be
interrupt
by
more
positive
sign
of
illness
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
say
about
his
go
to
Southampton
:
instead
of
that
,
the
chief
thought
of
his
mother
and
Anna
be
how
to
tend
this
patient
who
do
not
want
to
be
well
,
and
from
be
the
bright
,
most
grateful
spirit
in
the
household
,
be
metamorphose
into
an
irresponsive
,
dull
-
eyed
creature
who
meet
all
affectionate
attempt
with
a
murmur
of
"
let
me
alone
.
"
<EOS>
His
father
look
beyond
the
crisis
,
and
believe
it
to
be
the
short
way
out
of
an
unlucky
affair
;
but
he
be
sorry
for
the
inevitable
suffering
,
and
go
now
and
then
to
sit
by
him
in
silence
for
a
few
minute
,
part
with
a
gentle
pressure
of
his
hand
on
Rex
's
blank
brow
,
and
a
"
God
bless
you
,
my
boy
.
<EOS>
"
Warham
and
the
young
child
use
to
peep
round
the
edge
of
the
door
to
see
this
incredible
thing
of
their
lively
brother
be
lay
low
;
but
finger
be
immediately
shake
at
them
to
drive
them
back
.
<EOS>
the
guardian
who
be
always
there
be
Anna
,
and
her
little
hand
be
allow
to
rest
within
her
brother
's
,
though
he
never
give
it
a
welcome
pressure
.
<EOS>
Her
soul
be
divide
between
anguish
for
Rex
and
reproach
of
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
it
be
wicked
of
me
,
but
I
think
I
never

can

love
her
again

"
come
as
the
recurrent
burden
of
poor
little
Anna
's
inward
monody
.
<EOS>
and
even
Mrs.
Gascoigne
have
an
angry
feeling
toward
her
niece
which
she
could
not
refrain
from
express
(
apologetically
)
to
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
of
course
it
be
well
,
and
we
ought
to
be
thankful
that
she
be
not
in
love
with
the
poor
boy
;
but
really
.
<EOS>
Henry
,
I
think
she
be
hard
;
she
have
the
heart
of
a
coquette
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
think
that
she
must
have
make
him
believe
something
,
or
the
disappointment
would
not
have
take
hold
of
him
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
and
some
blame
attache
to
poor
Fanny
;
she
be
quite
blind
about
that
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
answer
imperatively
:
"
<EOS>
the
less
say
on
that
point
the
well
,
Nancy

<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
be
more
awake
myself

<EOS>
as
to
the
boy
,
be
thankful
if
nothing
bad
ever
happen
to
him
.
<EOS>
let
the
thing
die
out
as
quickly
as
possible
;
and
especially
with
regard
to
Gwendolen
 
<EOS>
let
it
be
as
if
it
have
never
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
rector
's
dominant
feeling
be
that
there
have
be
a
great
escape
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
in
love
with
Rex
in
return
would
have
make
a
much
hard
problem
,
the
solution
of
which
may
have
be
take
out
of
his
hand
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
to
go
through
some
further
difficulty
.
  
<EOS>
one
fine
morning
Rex
ask
for
his
bath
,
and
make
his
toilet
as
usual
.
<EOS>
Anna
,
full
of
excitement
at
this
change
,
could
do
nothing
but
listen
for
his
come
down
,
and
at
last
hear
his
step
,
run
to
the
foot
of
the
stair
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
he
give
her
a
faint
smile
,
but
it
look
so
melancholy
on
his
pale
face
that
she
could
hardly
help
cry
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nannie
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
gently
,
take
her
hand
and
lead
her
slowly
along
with
him
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
His
mother
be
there
,
and
when
she
come
to
kiss
him
,
he
say
:
"
what
a
plague
I
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
then
he
sit
still
and
look
out
of
the
bow
-
window
on
the
lawn
and
shrub
cover
with
hoar
-
frost
,
across
which
the
sun
be
send
faint
occasional
gleam
:
 
something
like
that
sad
smile
on
Rex
's
face
,
Anna
think
.
<EOS>
He
feel
as
if
he
have
have
a
resurrection
into
a
new
world
,
and
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
himself
there
,
the
old
interest
be
leave
behind
.
<EOS>
Anna
sit
near
him
,
pretend
to
work
,
but
really
watch
him
with
yearning
look
.
<EOS>
beyond
the
garden
hedge
there
be
a
road
where
wagon
and
cart
sometimes
go
on
field
-
work
:
a
rail
opening
be
make
in
the
hedge
,
because
the
upland
with
its
border
wood
and
clump
of
ash
-
tree
against
the
sky
be
a
pretty
sight
.
<EOS>
presently
there
come
along
a
wagon
laden
with
timber
;
the
horse
be
strain
their
grand
muscle
,
and
the
driver
have
crack
his
whip
,
run
along
anxiously
to
guide
the
leader
's
head
,
fear
a
swerve
.
<EOS>
Rex
seem
to
be
shake
into
attention
,
rise
and
look
till
the
last
quivering
trunk
of
the
timber
have
disappear
,
and
then
walk
once
or
twice
along
the
room
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Gascoigne
be
no
longer
there
,
and
when
he
come
to
sit
down
again
,
Anna
,
see
a
return
of
speech
in
her
brother
's
eye
,
could
not
resist
the
impulse
to
bring
a
little
stool
and
seat
herself
against
his
knee
,
look
up
at
him
with
an
expression
which
seem
to
say
,
"
do
speak
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
I
be
think
of
,
Nannie
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
to
Canada
,
or
somewhere
of
that
sort
.
"
<EOS>
(
Rex
have
not
study
the
character
of
our
colonial
possession
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Rex
,
not
for
always
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
to
get
my
bread
there
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
build
a
hut
,
and
work
hard
at
clearing
,
and
have
everything
wild
about
me
,
and
a
great
wide
quiet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
not
take
me
with
you
?
"
<EOS>
say
Anna
,
the
big
tear
come
fast
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
could
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
it
better
than
anything
;
and
settler
go
with
their
family
.
<EOS>
I
would
sooner
go
there
than
stay
here
in
England
.
<EOS>
I
could
make
the
fire
,
and
mend
the
clothe
,
and
cook
the
food
;
and
I
could
learn
how
to
make
the
bread
before
we
go
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
nice
than
anything
 
like
play
at
life
over
again
,
as
we
use
to
do
when
we
make
our
tent
with
the
drugget
,
and
have
our
little
plate
and
dish
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Father
and
mother
would
not
let
you
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
think
they
would
,
when
I
explain
everything
.
<EOS>
It
would
save
money
;
and
papa
would
have
more
to
bring
up
the
boy
with
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
further
talk
of
the
same
practical
kind
at
interval
,
and
it
end
in
Rex
's
be
oblige
to
consent
that
Anna
should
go
with
him
when
he
speak
to
his
father
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
it
be
when
the
rector
be
alone
in
his
study
.
<EOS>
Their
mother
would
become
reconcile
to
whatever
he
decide
on
,
but
mention
to
her
first
,
the
question
would
have
distress
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
child
!
"
say
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
cheerfully
,
as
they
enter

<EOS>
It
be
a
comfort
to
see
Rex
about
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
we
sit
down
with
you
a
little
,
papa

Anna

<EOS>
"
Rex
have
something
to
say

<EOS>
"

with
all
my

"
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
noticeable
group
that
these
three
creature
make
,
each
of
them
with
a
face
of
the
same
structural
type
 
<EOS>
the
straight
brow
,
the
nose
suddenly
straighten
from
an
intention
of
be
aquiline
,
the
short
upper
lip
,
the
short
but
strong
and
well
-
hung
chin
:
<EOS>
there
be
even
the
same
tone
of
complexion
and
set
of
the
eye
.
<EOS>
the
gray
-
haired
father
be
at
once
massive
and
keen
-
look
;
there
be
a
perpendicular
line
in
his
brow
which
when
he
speak
with
any
force
of
interest
deepen
;
and
the
habit
of
ruling
give
him
an
air
of
reserved
authoritativeness
.
<EOS>
Rex
would
have
seem
a
vision
of
his
father
's
youth
,
if
it
have
be
possible
to
imagine
Mr.
Gascoigne
without
distinct
plan
and
without
command
,
smitten
with
a
heart
sorrow
,
and
have
no
more
notion
of
concealment
than
a
sick
animal
;
and
Anna
be
a
tiny
copy
of
Rex
,
with
hair
draw
back
and
knot
,
<EOS>
her
face
follow
his
in
its
change
of
expression
,
as
if
they
have
one
soul
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
all
about
what
have
upset
me
,
father
,
"
Rex
begin
,
and
Mr.
Gascoigne
nod
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
quite
do
up
for
life

this
part

I
be
sure
it
will
be
no

my
go
back

Oxford

<EOS>
I
could
not

<EOS>
I
should
fail

I
want
to
have
your

take
another
course

<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
nod
more
slowly
,
the
perpendicular
line
on
his
brow
deepen

Anna

tremble

<EOS>
"
if
you
would
allow
me
a
small
outfit

I
should
like

go
to
the
colony
and
work
on
the
land
there
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Rex
think
the
vagueness
of
the
phrase
prudential
;
"
the
colony
"
necessarily
embrace
more
advantage
,
and
be
less
capable
of
be
rebut
on
a
single
ground
than
any
particular
settlement

<EOS>
"
oh
,
and
with
me
,
papa
,
"
say
Anna
,
not
bear
to
be
leave
out
from
the
proposal
even
temporarily
.
<EOS>
"
Rex
would
want
some
one
to
take
care
of
him
,
you
know
 
<EOS>
some
one
to
keep
house

<EOS>
and
we

never

either

I

so
happy

<EOS>
I
know
it
would
be
hard
to
leave
you

mamma

but
there
be
all
the
other
to
bring
up
,

we
two
should
be
no

you
any
more

"
  
<EOS>
Anna
have
rise
from
her
seat
,
and
use
the
feminine
argument
of
go
closer
to
her
papa
as
she
speak
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
smile
,
but
he
draw
her
on
his
knee
and
hold
her
there
,
as
if
to
put
her
gently
out
of
the
question
while
he
speak
to
Rex
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
admit
that
my
experience
give
me
some
power
of
judge
for
you
,
and
that
I
can
probably
guide
you
in
practical
matter
better
than
you
can
guide
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
Rex
be
oblige
to
say
,
"
yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
perhaps
you
will
admit
 
though
I
do
not
wish
to
press
that
point
 
that
you
be
bind
in
duty
to
consider
my
judgment

wish
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
yet
place
myself
in
opposition
to
you
,
sir

<EOS>
"
Rex
in
his
secret
soul
could
not
feel
that
he
be
bind
not
to
go
to
the
colony
,
but
to
go
to
Oxford
again
 
which
be
the
point
in
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
will
do
so
if
you
persist
in
set
your
mind
toward
a
rash
and
foolish
procedure
,
and
deafen
yourself
to
consideration
which
my
experience
of
life
assure
me
of
.
<EOS>
You
think
,
I
suppose
,
that
you
have
have
a
shock
which
have
change
all
your
inclination
,
stupefy
your
brain
,
unfitted
you
for
anything
but
manual
labor
,
and
give
you
a
dislike
to
society
?
<EOS>
be
that
what
you
believe
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
something
like
that
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
be
up
to
the
sort
of
work
I
must
do
to
live
in
this
part
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
spirit
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
be
the
same
again
.
<EOS>
and
without
any
disrespect
to
you
,
father
,
I
think
a
young
fellow
should
be
allow
to
choose
his
way
of
life
,
if
he
do
nobody
any
harm
.
<EOS>
there
be
plenty
to
stay
at
home
,
and
those
who
like
may
be
allow
to
go
where
there
be
empty
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
suppose
I
be
convince
on
good
evidence
 
as
I
be
 
that
this
state
of
mind
of
yours
be
transient
,
and
that
if
you
go
off
as
you
propose
,
you
would
by
-
and
-
by
repent
,
and
feel
that
you
have
let
yourself
slip
back
from
the
point
you
have
be
gain
by
your
education
till
now
?
<EOS>
have
you
not
strength
of
mind
enough
to
see
that
you
have
well
act
on
my
assurance
for
a
time
,
and
test
it
?
<EOS>
in
my
opinion
,
so
far
from
agree
with
you
that
you
should
be
free
to
turn
yourself
into
a
colonist
and
work
in
your
shirt
-
sleeve
with
spade
and
hatchet
 
in
my
opinion
<EOS>
you
have
no
right
whatever
to
expatriate
yourself
until
you
have
honestly
endeavor
to
turn
to
account
the
education
you
have
receive
here
.
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
of
the
grief
to
your
mother
and
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
sorry
;
but
what
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
study
 
<EOS>
that
be
certain
,
"
say
Rex
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
just
now
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
to
miss
a
term
.
<EOS>
I
have
make
arrangement
for
you
 
how
you
be
to
spend
the
next
two
month
.
<EOS>
but
I
confess
I
be
disappointed
in
you
,
Rex
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
have
more
sense
than
to
take
up
such
idea
 
to
suppose
that
because
you
have
fall
into
a
very
common
trouble
,
such
as
most
man
have
to
go
through
,
you
be
loosen
from
all
bond
of
duty
 
just
as
if
your
brain
have
soften
and
you
be
no
longer
a
responsible
being
.
"
  
<EOS>
what
could
Rex
say
?
<EOS>
inwardly
he
be
in
a
state
of
rebellion
,
but
he
have
no
argument
to
meet
his
father
's
;
and
while
he
be
feel
,
in
spite
of
any
thing
that
may
be
say
,
that
he
should
like
to
go
off
to
"
the
colony
"
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
,
it
lie
in
a
deep
fold
of
his
consciousness
that
he
ought
to
feel
 
if
he
have
be
a
well
fellow
he
would
have
feel
 
more
about
his
old
tie
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
sort
of
faith
we
live
by
in
our
soul
sickness
.
  
<EOS>
Rex
get
up
from
his
seat
,
as
if
he
hold
the
conference
to
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
assent
to
my
arrangement
,
then
?
"
say
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
with
that
distinct
resolution
of
tone
which
seem
to
hold
one
in
a
vise
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
pause
before
Rex
answer
,
"
I
will
try
what
I
can
do
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
promise
.
<EOS>
"
His
thought
be
,
that
try
would
be
of
no
use
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
keep
Anna
,
hold
her
fast
,
though
she
want
to
follow
Rex
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
papa
,
"
she
say
,
the
tear
come
with
her
word
when
the
door
have
close
;
"
it
be
very
hard
for
him
.
<EOS>
do
not
he
look
ill
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
but
he
will
soon
be
well
;
it
will
all
blow
over
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
Anna
,
be
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
about
it
all
.
<EOS>
never
let
it
be
mention
when
he
be
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
papa
.
<EOS>
but
I
would
not
be
like
Gwendolen
for
any
thing
 
to
have
people
fall
in
love
with
me
so
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
dreadful
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anna
dare
not
say
that
she
be
disappoint
at
not
be
allow
to
go
to
the
colony
with
Rex
;
but
that
be
her
secret
feeling
,
and
she
often
afterward
go
inwardly
over
the
whole
affair
,
say
to
herself
,
"
I
should
have
do
with
go
out
,
and
glove
,
and
crinoline
,
and
have
to
talk
when
I
be
take
to
dinner
 
and
all
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
like
to
mark
the
time
,
and
connect
the
course
of
individual
life
with
the
historic
stream
,
for
all
class
of
thinker
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
period
when
the
broadening
of
gauge
in
crinoline
seem
to
demand
an
agitation
for
the
general
enlargement
of
church
,
ball
-
room
,
and
vehicle
.
<EOS>
but
Anna
Gascoigne
's
figure
would
only
allow
the
size
of
skirt
manufacture
for
young
lady
of
fourteen
.
      
<EOS>
I
will
tell
thee
,
Berthold
,
what
man
's
hope
be
like
:
  
<EOS>
a
silly
child
that
,
quiver
with
joy
,
  
Would
cast
its
little
mimic
fishing
-
line
  
bait
with
loadstone
for
a
bowl
of
toy
  
<EOS>
in
the
salt
ocean
.
   
<EOS>
eight
month
after
the
arrival
of
the
family
at
Offendene
,
that
be
to
say
in
the
end
of
the
follow
June
,
a
rumor
be
spread
in
the
neighborhood
which
to
many
person
be
matter
of
exciting
interest
.
<EOS>
It
have
no
reference
to
the
result
of
the
american
war
,
but
it
be
one
which
touch
all
class
within
a
certain
circuit
round
Wanchester
:
<EOS>
the
corn
-
factor
,
the
brewer
,
the
horse
-
dealer
,
and
saddler
,
all
hold
it
a
laudable
thing
,
and
one
which
be
to
be
rejoice
in
on
abstract
ground
,
as
show
the
value
of
an
aristocracy
in
a
free
country
like
England
;
the
blacksmith
in
the
hamlet
of
Diplow
feel
that
a
good
time
have
come
round
;
the
wife
of
labor
man
hope
their
nimble
boy
of
ten
or
twelve
would
be
take
into
employ
by
the
gentleman
in
livery
;
and
the
farmer
about
Diplow
admit
,
with
a
tincture
of
bitterness
and
reserve
that
a
man
may
now
again
perhaps
have
an
easy
market
or
exchange
for
a
rick
of
old
hay
or
a
wagon
-
load
of
straw
.
<EOS>
if
such
be
the
hope
of
low
person
not
in
society
,
it
may
be
easily
infer
that
their
better
have
well
reason
for
satisfaction
,
probably
connect
with
the
pleasure
of
life
rather
than
its
business
.
<EOS>
marriage
,
however
,
must
be
consider
as
come
under
both
head
;
and
just
as
when
a
visit
of
majesty
be
announce
,
the
dream
of
knighthood
or
a
baronetcy
be
to
be
find
under
various
municipal
nightcap
,
so
the
news
in
question
raise
a
float
indeterminate
vision
of
marriage
in
several
well
-
breed
imagination
.
  
<EOS>
the
news
be
that
Diplow
Hall
,
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
's
place
,
which
have
for
a
couple
of
year
turn
its
white
window
-
shutter
in
a
painfully
wall
-
eyed
manner
on
its
fine
elm
and
beech
,
its
lilied
pool
and
grassy
acre
speck
with
deer
,
be
be
prepare
for
a
tenant
,
and
be
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
and
through
the
hunt
season
to
be
inhabit
in
a
fitting
style
both
as
to
house
and
stable
.
<EOS>
but
not
by
Sir
Hugo
himself
:
by
his
nephew
,
Mr.
Mallinger
Grandcourt
,
who
be
presumptive
heir
to
the
baronetcy
,
his
uncle
's
marriage
have
produce
nothing
but
girl
.
<EOS>
nor
be
this
the
only
contingency
with
which
fortune
flatter
young
Grandcourt
,
as
he
be
pleasantly
call
;
for
while
the
chance
of
the
baronetcy
come
through
his
father
,
his
mother
have
give
a
baronial
streak
to
his
blood
,
so
that
if
certain
intervene
person
slightly
paint
in
the
middle
distance
die
,
he
would
become
a
baron
and
peer
of
this
realm
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
uneven
allotment
of
nature
that
the
male
bird
alone
have
the
tuft
,
but
we
have
not
yet
follow
the
advice
of
hasty
philosopher
who
would
have
us
copy
nature
entirely
in
these
matter
;
and
if
Mr.
Mallinger
Grandcourt
become
a
baronet
or
a
peer
,
his
wife
would
share
the
title
 
which
in
addition
to
his
actual
fortune
be
certainly
a
reason
why
that
wife
,
be
at
present
unchosen
,
should
be
think
of
by
more
than
one
person
with
a
sympathetic
interest
as
a
woman
sure
to
be
well
provide
for
.
  
<EOS>
some
reader
of
this
history
will
doubtless
regard
it
as
incredible
that
people
should
construct
matrimonial
prospect
on
the
mere
report
that
a
bachelor
of
good
fortune
and
possibility
be
come
within
reach
,
and
will
reject
the
statement
as
a
mere
outflow
of
gall
:
they
will
aver
that
neither
they
nor
their
first
cousin
have
mind
so
unbridled
;
and
that
in
fact
this
be
not
human
nature
,
which
would
know
that
such
speculation
may
turn
out
to
be
fallacious
,
and
would
therefore
not
entertain
them
.
<EOS>
but
,
let
it
be
observe
,
nothing
be
here
narrate
of
human
nature
generally
:
the
history
in
its
present
stage
concern
only
a
few
people
in
a
corner
of
Wessex
 
whose
reputation
,
however
,
be
unimpeached
,
and
who
,
I
be
in
the
proud
position
of
be
able
to
state
,
be
all
on
visit
term
with
person
of
rank
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
the
Arrowpoints
,
for
example
,
in
their
beautiful
place
at
Quetcham
:
no
one
could
attribute
sordid
view
in
relation
to
their
daughter
's
marriage
to
parent
who
could
leave
her
at
least
half
a
million
;
but
have
affectionate
anxiety
about
their
Catherine
's
position
(
she
have
resolutely
refuse
Lord
Slogan
,
an
unexceptionable
irish
peer
,
whose
estate
want
nothing
but
drainage
and
population
)
,
they
wonder
,
perhaps
from
something
more
than
a
charitable
impulse
,
whether
Mr.
Grandcourt
be
good
-
look
,
of
sound
constitution
,
virtuous
,
or
at
least
reform
,
and
if
liberal

conservative

not
too
liberal
-
conservative
;
and
without
wish
anybody
to
die
,
think
his
succession
to
the
title
an
event
to
be
desire
.
  
<EOS>
if
the
Arrowpoints
have
such
rumination
,
it
be
the
less
surprising
that
they
be
stimulate
in
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
who
for
be
a
clergyman
be
not
the
less
subject
to
the
anxiety
of
a
parent
and
guardian
;
and
we
have
see
how
both
he
and
Mrs.
Gascoigne
may
by
this
time
have
come
to
feel
that
he
be
overcharged
with
the
management
of
young
creature
who
be
hardly
to
be
hold
in
with
bit
or
bridle
,
or
any
sort
of
metaphor
that
would
stand
for
judicious
advice
.
  
<EOS>
naturally
,
people
do
not
tell
each
other
all
they
feel
and
think
about
young
Grandcourt
's
advent
:
on
no
subject
be
this
openness
find
prudently
practicable
 
not
even
on
the
generation
of
acid
,
or
the
destination
of
the
fix
star
:
for
either
your
contemporary
with
a
mind
turn
toward
the
same
subject
may
find
your
idea
ingenious
and
forestall
you
in
apply
them
,
or
he
may
have
other
view
on
acid
and
fix
star
,
and
think
ill
of
you
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
do
not
ask
Mr.
Arrowpoint
if
he
have
any
trustworthy
source
of
information
about
Grandcourt
consider
as
a
husband
for
a
charming
girl
;
nor
do
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
observe
to
Mrs.
Davilow
that
if
the
possible
peer
seek
a
wife
in
the
neighborhood
of
Diplow
,
the
only
reasonable
expectation
be
that
he
would
offer
his
hand
to
Catherine
,
who
,
however
,
would
not
accept
him
unless
he
be
in
all
respect
fit
to
secure
her
happiness
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
even
to
his
wife
the
rector
be
silent
as
to
the
contemplation
of
any
matrimonial
result
,
from
the
probability
that
Mr.
Grandcourt
would
see
Gwendolen
at
the
next
Archery
Meeting
;
though
Mrs.
Gascoigne
's
mind
be
very
likely
still
more
active
in
the
same
direction
.
<EOS>
She
have
say
interjectionally
to
her
sister
,
"
It
would
be
a
mercy
,
Fanny
,
if
that
girl
be
well
married
!
"
<EOS>
to
which
Mrs.
Davilow
discern
some
criticism
of
her
darling
in
the
fervor
of
that
wish
,
have
not
choose
to
make
any
audible
reply
,
though
she
have
say
inwardly
,
"
You
will
not
get
her
to
marry
for
your
pleasure
"
;
the
mild
mother
become
rather
saucy
when
she
identify
herself
with
her
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
to
her
husband
Mrs.
Gascoigne
say
,
"
I
hear
Mr.
Grandcourt
have
get
two
place
of
his
own
,
but
he
come
to
Diplow
for
the
hunting
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
hope
he
will
set
a
good
example
in
the
neighborhood
.
<EOS>
have
you
hear
what
sort
of
a
young
man
he
be
,
Henry
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
have
not
hear
;
at
least
,
if
his
male
acquaintance
have
gossip
in
his
hearing
,
he
be
not
dispose
to
repeat
their
gossip
,
or
to
give
it
any
emphasis
in
his
own
mind
.
<EOS>
He
hold
it
futile
,
even
if
it
have
be
become
,
to
show
any
curiosity
as
to
the
past
of
a
young
man
whose
birth
,
wealth
,
and
consequent
leisure
make
many
habit
venial
which
under
other
circumstance
would
have
be
inexcusable
.
<EOS>
whatever
Grandcourt
have
do
,
he
have
not
ruin
himself
;
and
it
be
well
-
know
that
in
gambling
,
for
example
,
whether
of
the
business
or
holiday
sort
,
a
man
who
have
the
strength
of
mind
to
leave
off
when
he
have
only
ruin
other
,
be
a
reform
character
.
<EOS>
this
be
an
illustration
merely
:
Mr.
Gascoigne
have
not
hear
that
Grandcourt
have
be
a
gambler
;
and
we
can
hardly
pronounce
him
singular
in
feel
that
a
landed
proprietor
with
a
mixture
of
noble
blood
in
his
vein
be
not
to
be
an
object
of
suspicious
inquiry
like
a
reform
character
who
offer
himself
as
your
butler
or
footman
.
<EOS>
reformation
,
where
a
man
can
afford
to
do
without
it
,
can
hardly
be
other
than
genuine
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
it
be
not
certain
on
any
other
showing
hitherto
,
that
Mr.
Grandcourt
have
need
reformation
more
than
other
young
man
in
the
ripe
youth
of
five
-
and
-
thirty
;
and
,
at
any
rate
,
the
significance
of
what
he
have
be
must
be
determine
by
what
he
actually
be
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
,
too
,
although
she
would
not
respond
to
her
sister
's
pregnant
remark
,
could
not
be
inwardly
indifferent
to
an
advent
that
may
promise
a
brilliant
lot
for
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
a
little
speculation
on
"
what
may
be
"
come
naturally
,
without
encouragement
 
come
inevitably
in
the
form
of
image
,
when
unknown
person
be
mention
;
and
Mr.
Grandcourt
's
name
raise
in
Mrs.
Davilow
's
mind
first
of
all
the
picture
of
a
handsome
,
accomplished
,
excellent
young
man
whom
she
would
be
satisfied
with
as
a
husband
for
her
daughter
;
but
then
come
the
further
speculation
 
would
Gwendolen
be
satisfied
with
him
?
<EOS>
there
be
no
knowing
what
would
meet
that
girl
's
taste
or
touch
her
affection
 
<EOS>
it
may
be
something
else
than
excellence
;
and
thus
the
image
of
the
perfect
suitor
give
way
before
a
fluctuate
combination
of
quality
that
may
be
imagine
to
win
Gwendolen
's
heart
.
<EOS>
in
the
difficulty
of
arrive
at
the
particular
combination
which
would
insure
that
result
,
the
mother
even
say
to
herself
,
"
It
would
not
signify
about
her
be
in
love
,
if
she
would
only
accept
the
right
person
.
"
<EOS>
for
whatever
marriage
have
be
for
herself
,
how
could
she
the
less
desire
it
for
her
daughter
?
<EOS>
the
difference
her
own
misfortune
make
be
,
that
she
never
dare
to
dwell
much
to
Gwendolen
on
the
desirableness
of
marriage
,
dread
an
answer
something
like
that
of
the
future
Madame
Roland
,
when
her
gentle
mother
urge
the
acceptance
of
a
suitor
,
say
,
"
Tu
sera
heureuse
,
ma
chère
.
"
<EOS>
"
Oui
,
maman
,
comme
toi
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
relation
to
the
problematic
Mr.
Grandcourt
least
of
all
would
Mrs.
Davilow
have
willingly
let
fall
a
hint
of
the
aerial
castle
-
building
which
she
have
the
good
taste
to
be
ashamed
of
;
for
such
a
hint
be
likely
enough
to
give
an
adverse
poise
to
Gwendolen
's
own
thought
,
and
make
her
det
the
desirable
husband
beforehand
.
<EOS>
since
that
scene
after
poor
Rex
's
farewell
visit
,
the
mother
have
feel
a
new
sense
of
peril
in
touch
the
mystery
of
her
child
's
feeling
,
and
in
rashly
determine
what
be
her
welfare
:
only
she
could
think
of
welfare
in
no
other
shape
than
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
the
discussion
of
the
dress
that
Gwendolen
be
to
wear
at
the
Archery
Meeting
be
a
relevant
topic
,
however
;
and
when
it
have
be
decide
that
as
a
touch
of
color
on
her
white
cashmere
,
nothing
,
for
her
complexion
,
be
comparable
to
pale
green
 
<EOS>
a
feather
which
she
be
try
in
her
hat
before
the
looking

glass
have
settle
the
question
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
feel
her
ear
tingle
when
Gwendolen
,
suddenly
throw
herself
into
the
attitude
of
draw
her
bow
,
say
with
a
look
of
comic
enjoyment
    
<EOS>
"
how
I
pity
all
the
other

the
Archery
Meeting

<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
have
not
the
presence

immediately

Gwendolen
turn
round
quickly
toward
her

say
,
wickedly
    
"

turn
up
his

a

a

uncertain

about

Gwendolen

with
a
high
note
of
careless
admission

take
off
her
good
hat
and
turn
it
round
on
her
hand
contemplatively
.
<EOS>

I
wonder
what
sort

I
know
he
would
have
hunter

racer

a
London
house

two
country

house
 
one
with
battlement
and
another
with

I
feel
sure
that
with

Poor
Mrs.

uncomfortable

<EOS>
Her
own

be
usually
literal
and
in
intention
innocent

and
she
say
with
a
distressed
brow
:
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
talk
in

way

for
heaven

<EOS>
you
do

they
give
you
such
idea

I
declare
when
your

I

in
the
crushed

give
a

how

say
poor
Mrs.

unable

hear
the
retraction

sob
violently
while
she
make
the
effort
to
speak

<EOS>
Your
will

too
strong

<EOS>
this
disjoin
logic
be
intelligible
enough
to
the
daughter

"

dear
mamma

I
do
not

fault

you

here
Gwendolen

really
 
I
be
content

better

how
dreadfully
dull
you
must
have
be

"
  
<EOS>
such
tender
cajolery
serve
to
quiet
the
mother
,
as
it
have
often
do
before
after
like
collision
.
<EOS>
not
that
the
collision
have
often
be
repeat
at
the
same
point
;
for
in
the
memory
of
both
they
leave
an
association
of
dread
with
the
particular
topic
which
have
occasion
them
:
Gwendolen
dread
the
unpleasant
sense
of
compunction
toward
her
mother
,
which
be
the
near
approach
to
self
-
condemnation
and
self
-
distrust
that
she
have
know
;
and
Mrs.
Davilow
's
timid
maternal
conscience
dread
whatever
have
bring
on
the
slight
hint
of
reproach
.
<EOS>
hence
,
after
this
little
scene
,
the
two
concur
in
exclude
Mr.
Grandcourt
from
their
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Gascoigne
once
or
twice
refer
to
him
,
Mrs.
Davilow
fear
least
Gwendolen
should
betray
some
of
her
alarm
keen
-
sightedness
about
what
be
probably
in
her
uncle
's
mind
;
but
the
fear
be
not
justify

<EOS>
Gwendolen
know
certain
difference
in
the
character
with
which
she
be
concern
as
bird
know
climate

for
the
very
reason
that
she
be
determine

<EOS>
the
good
understanding
between
them
be
much
foster
by
their
enjoyment
of
archery
together
:
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
as
one
of
the
good
bowman
in
Wessex
,
be
gratify
to
find
the
element
of
like
skill
in
his
niece
;
and
Gwendolen
be
the
more
careful
not
to
lose
the
shelter
of
his
fatherly
indulgence
,
because
since
the
trouble
with
Rex
both
Mrs.
Gascoigne
and
Anna
have
be
unable
to
hide
what
she
feel
to
be
a
very
unreasonable
alienation
from
her
.
<EOS>
toward
Anna
she
take
some
pain
to
behave
with
a
regretful
affectionateness
;
but
neither
of
them
dare
to
mention
Rex
's
name
,
and
Anna
,
to
whom
the
thought
of
him
be
part
of
the
air
she
breathe
,
be
ill
at
ease
with
the
lively
cousin
who
have
ruin
his
happiness
.
<EOS>
She
try
dutifully
to
repress
any
sign
of
her
changed
feeling
;
but
who
in
pain
can
imitate
the
glance
and
hand
-
touch
of
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
this
unfair
resentment
have
rather
a
hardening
effect
on
Gwendolen
,
and
throw
her
into
a
more
defiant
temper
.
<EOS>
Her
uncle
too
may
be
offend
if
she
refuse
the
next
person
who
fall
in
love
with
her
;
and
one

when
that
idea
be
in

<EOS>
she
say
    
<EOS>
"
Mamma

I

happily

Mr.
Middleton
be

without

make
any

and
notwithstanding
the
admiration
for
the
handsome
Miss
Harleth
,
extend
perhaps
over
thirty
square
mile
in
a
part
of

stud
with

whose

include
several
disengaged
young

,
each
glad
to
seat
himself
by
the
lively
girl
with
whom
it
be
so
easy
to
get
on
in
conversation
,
 
notwithstanding
these
ground
for
argue
that
Gwendolen
be
likely
to
have
other
suitor
more
explicit
than
the
cautious
curate
,
the
fact
be
not
so
.
  
<EOS>
care
have
be
take
not
only
that
the
tree
should
not
sweep
the
star
down
,
but
also
that
every
man
who
admire
a
fair
girl
should
not
be
enamor
of
her
,
and
even
that
every
man
who
be
enamor
should
not
necessarily
declare
himself
.
<EOS>
there
be
various
refined
shape
in
which
the
price
of
corn
,
know
to
be
potent
cause
in
their

may
,
if
inquire

show
why
a
young

,
perfect
in
person
,
accomplishment
,
and
costume
,
have
not
the
trouble
of
reject
many
offer
;
and
nature
's
order
be
certainly
benignant
in
not
oblige
us
one
and
all
to
be
desperately
in
love
with
the
most
admirable
mortal
we
have
ever
see
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
we
know
,
be
far
from
hold
that
supremacy
in
the
mind
of
all
observer
.
<EOS>
besides
,
it
be
but
a
poor
eight
month
since
she
have
come
to
Offendene
,
and
some
inclination
become
manifest
slowly
,
like
the
sunward
creeping
of

<EOS>
in
face
of
this
fact
that
not
one
of
the
eligible
young
man
already
in
the
neighborhood
have
make
Gwendolen
an
offer
,
why
should
Mr.
Grandcourt
be
think
of
as
likely
to
do
what
they
have
leave
undone
?
  
<EOS>
perhaps
because
he
be
think
of
as
still
more
eligible
;
since
a
great
deal
of
what
pass
for
likelihood
in
the
world
be
simply
the
reflex
of
a
wish

Mr.

have
no
anxiety
that
Miss

the

no

<EOS>
within

no

the

probably

among

no

<EOS>
pre

be
sweet
to
those

love

<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
not
quite
mythical
that
a

have
be
proud
to
be

and
probably
a

for

and
that

<EOS>
who
can
deny
that

be

the
pretty

for
feminine

<EOS>
They

<EOS>
Archery
have
no
ugly
smell
of
brimstone

break

its
only
danger

<EOS>
and
among

the

not

to

these

altogether
the

be

there

to
disturb

or
the
course

all
skillful
preparation
have
fair
play

and
when
there
be
a
general
march
to
extract
the
arrow
,
the
promenade
of
joyous
young
creature
in
light
speech

laughter

the
graceful

<EOS>
here
Gwendolen

It

perhaps
she
have
never

so
well

<EOS>
Her
face
be
beam
with
young
pleasure
in
which
there
be
no
malign
ray

discontent
;
for
be
satisfied
with
her

she
feel
kindly

<EOS>
not

like
Miss

give

<EOS>
for
personal
recommendation
she
would
not
have
care
to
change
the
family
group
accompany
her
for
any
other
:
her
mamma

appearance
would
have
suit

amiable
duchess
;
her
uncle
and
aunt
Gascoigne
with
Anna
make
equally
gratify

and
Gwendolen
be
too
full
of
joyous
belief
in
herself
to
feel
in
the
least
jealous
though
Miss
Arrowpoint
be
one
of

<EOS>
even
the
reappearance

which
cause
some
surprise
in

rest

inclination

<EOS>
what
great

could

figure

meeting
?
<EOS>
there
be
a
very
satirical
light
in
Gwendolen
's
eye
as
she
look
toward
the
Arrowpoint
party
on
their
first
entrance
,
when
the
contrast
between
Klesmer
and

group
of

country
people
seem
at
its

intensity
in

close
neighborhood
of

as
Mrs.

would
have

and
perfect
tailor
may
pass
everywhere
without
ridicule
?
<EOS>
one
feel
why
it
be
often
well
for
greatness
to
be
dead
,
and
to
have
get
rid
of
the
outward
man
.
  
<EOS>
many
present
know
Klesmer
,
or
know
of
him
;
but
they
have
only
see
him
on
candle
-
light
occasion
when
he
appear
simply
as
a
musician
,
and
he
have
not
yet
that
supreme
,
world
-
wide
celebrity
which
make
an
artist
great
to
the
most
ordinary
people
by
their
knowledge
of
his
great
expensiveness
.
<EOS>
It
be
literally
a
new
light
for
them
to
see
him
in
 
present
unexpectedly
on
this
July
afternoon
in
an
exclusive
society
:
some
be
incline
to
laugh
,
other
feel
a
little
disgust
at
the
want
of
judgment
show
by
the
Arrowpoints
in
this
use
of
an
introductory
card
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
extreme
guy
those
artistic
fellow
usually
be
?
"
say
young
Clintock
to
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
do
look
at
the
figure
he
cut
,
bow
with
his
hand
on
his
heart
to
Lady
Brackenshaw
 
and
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
's
feather
just
reach
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
one
of
the
profane
,
"
say
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
blind
to
the
majesty
of
genius
.
<EOS>
Herr
Klesmer
smite
me
with
awe
;
I
feel
crushed
in
his
presence
;
my
courage
all
ooze
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
you
understand
all
about
his
music
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
,
indeed
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
with
a
light
laugh
;
"
it
be
he
who
understand
all
about
mine
and
think
it
pitiable
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Klesmer
's
verdict
on
her
singing
have
be
an
easy
joke
to
her
since
he
have
be
strike
by
her
_
plastik
_
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
address
to
the
ear
of
the
future
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
I
be
glad
of
that
:
it
suit
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
you
be
very
kind
.
<EOS>
but
how
remarkably
well
Miss
Arrowpoint
look
to
-
day
!
<EOS>
She
would
make
quite
a
fine
picture
in
that
gold
-
color
dress
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
too
splendid
,
do
not
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
perhaps
a
little
too
symbolical
 
too
much
like
the
figure
of
Wealth
in
an
allegory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
speech
of
Gwendolen
's
have
rather
a
malicious
sound
,
but
it
be
not
really
more
than
a
bubble
of
fun
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
wish
Miss
Arrowpoint
or
any
one
else
to
be
out
of
the
way
,
believe
in
her
own
good
fortune
even
more
than
in
her
skill
.
<EOS>
the
belief
in
both
naturally
grow
strong
as
the
shooting
go
on
,
for
she
promise
to
achieve
one
of
the
good
score
 
a
success
which
astonish
every
one
in
a
new
member
;
and
to
Gwendolen
's
temperament
one
success
determine
another
.
<EOS>
She
tread
on
air
,
and
all
thing
pleasant
seem
possible
.
<EOS>
the
hour
be
enough
for
her
,
and
she
be
not
oblige
to
think
what
she
should
do
next
to
keep
her
life
at
the
due
pitch
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
the
score
stand
,
I
wonder
?
"
say
Lady
Brackenshaw
,
a
gracious
personage
who
,
adorn
with
two
little
girl
and
a
boy
of
stout
make
,
sit
as
lady
paramount
.
<EOS>
Her
lord
have
come
up
to
her
in
one
of
the
interval
of
shooting
.
<EOS>
"
It
seem
to
me
that
Miss
Harleth
be
likely
to
win
the
gold
arrow
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gad
,
I
think
she
will
,
if
she
carry
it
on

<EOS>
she
be
run
Juliet

<EOS>
It
be
wonderful
for

Catherine

his

she
get
the

there
be
a
luck
even
in

Catherine
will

very
glad

Mrs.

she
be
so
magnanimous

<EOS>
It
be
entirely
her
considerateness
that
make
us
bring
Herr
Klesmer
instead
of
Canon
Stopley
,
who
have
express
a
wish

for

I

I
tell

it

old

He
come
to
us
on
Tuesday

say
he
have
be
a
little
bothered

He
may
have
be
pull
in

<EOS>
why

Gascoigne

"
 
<EOS>
the
rector
be
just
then
cross
at
a
little
distance
with
Gwendolen
on
his
arm
,
and
turn
in
compliance
with
the
call
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
little
too
bad
;
you
not
only
beat

yourself

you
bring
up

beat
all
the
archeresse

<EOS>
It
<EOS>

Mr.
Gascoigne
,
with
much
inward
satisfaction
curl
his
short
upper
lip

it
be
not
my
doing

my
lord

I
only
mean
her
to
make

tolerable
figure

without
surpass
any
one

"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
my
fault

either

Gwendolen

with
pretty
archness

<EOS>
"
if
I
be
to
aim

I
can
not

"
  
<EOS>
"
ay

ay

that
may
be
a
fatal
business
for
some
people

Lord
Brackenshaw

good
-
humoredly
;
then
take
out
his
watch
and
look
at
Mrs.

again
 
<EOS>
"
the
time
's
get
on
,
as
you
say
.
<EOS>
but
Grandcourt
be
always
late
.
<EOS>
I
notice
in
town
he
be
always
late
,
and
he
be
no
bowman
 
<EOS>
understand
nothing
about
it
.
<EOS>
but
I
tell
him
he
must
come
;
he
would
see
the
flower
of
the
neighborhood
here
.
<EOS>
He
ask
about
you
 
have
see
Arrowpoint
's
card
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
have
not
make
his
acquaintance
in
town

<EOS>
He
have
be
a
good
deal
abroad
.
<EOS>
People
do
not
know
him
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
we
be
stranger
,

Mrs.

that
be
not
what
may
have

great

his
lordship

smile
toward
the
rector
.
<EOS>
"
but
just
come
with
me
one
instant
,
Gascoigne
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
I
want
to
speak
a
word
about
the
clout
-
shooting
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
choose
to
go
too
and
be
deposit
in
the
same
group
with
her
mamma
and
aunt
until
she
have
to
shoot
again
.
<EOS>
that
Mr.
Grandcourt
may
after
all
not
appear
on
the
archery
-
ground
,
have
begin
to
enter
into
Gwendolen
's
thought
as
a
possible
deduction
from
the
completeness
of
her
pleasure
.
<EOS>
under
all
her
saucy
satire
,
provoke
chiefly
by
her
divination
that
her
friend
think
of
him
as
a
desirable
match
for
her
,
she
feel
something
very
far
from
indifference
as
to
the
impression
she
would
make
on
him
.
<EOS>
true
,
he
be
not
to
have
the
slight
power
over
her
<EOS>
(
for
Gwendolen
have
not
consider
that
the
desire
to
conquer
be
itself
a
sort
of
subjection
)
;
she
have
make
up
her
mind
that
he
be
to
be
one
of
those
complimentary
and
assiduously
admire
man
of
whom
even
her
narrow
experience
have
show
her
several
with
various
-
colored
beard
and
various
style
of
bearing
;
and
the
sense
that
her
friend
would
want
her
to
think
him
delightful
,
give
her
a
resistant
inclination
to
presuppose
him
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
no
reason
why
she
could
spare
his
presence
:
and
even
a
pass
prevision
of
trouble
in
case
she
despise
and
refuse
him
,
raise
not
the
shadow
of
a
wish
that
he
should
save
her
that
trouble
by
show
no
disposition
to
make
her
an
offer
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grandcourt
take
hardly
any
notice
of
her
,
and
become
shortly
engage
to
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
be
not
a
picture
which
flatter
her
imagination
.
  
<EOS>
hence
Gwendolen
have
be
all
ear
to
Lord
Brackenshaw
's
mode
of
account
for
Grandcourt
's
non
-
appearance
;
and
when
he
do
arrive
,
no
consciousness
 
not
even
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
's
or
Mr.
Gascoigne
's
 
be
more
awake
to
the
fact
than
her
,
although
she
steadily
avoid
look
toward
any
point
where
he
be
likely
to
be
.
<EOS>
there
should
be
no
slight
shifting
of
angle
to
betray
that
it
be
of
any
consequence
to
her
whether
the
much
-
talk
-
of
<EOS>
Mr.
Mallinger
Grandcourt
present
himself
or
not
.
<EOS>
She
become
again
absorb
in
the
shooting
,
and
so
resolutely
abstain
from
look
round
observantly
that
,
even
suppose
him
to
have
take
a
conspicuous
place
among
the
spectator
<EOS>
,
it
may
be
clear
she
be
not
aware
of
him
.
<EOS>
and
all
the
while
the
certainty
that
he
be
there
make
a
distinct
thread
in
her
consciousness
.
<EOS>
perhaps
her
shooting
be
the
well
for
it
:
at
any
rate
,
it
gain
in
precision
,
and
she
at
last
raise
a
delightful
storm
of
clapping
and
applause
by
three
hit
run
in
the
gold
 
<EOS>
a
feat
which
among
the
Brackenshaw
archer
have
not
the
vulgar
reward
of
a
shill
poll
-
tax
,
but
that
of
a
special
gold
star
to
be
wear
on
the
breast
.
<EOS>
that
moment
be
not
only
a
happy
one
to
herself
 
<EOS>
it
be
just
what
her
mamma
and
her
uncle
would
have
choose
for
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
general
fall
into
rank
to
give
her
space
that
she
may
advance
conspicuously
to
receive
the
gold
star
from
the
hand
of
Lady
Brackenshaw
;
and
the
perfect
movement
of
her
fine
form
be
certainly
a
pleasant
thing
to
behold
in
the
clear
afternoon
light
when
the
shadow
be
long
and
still
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
central
object
of
that
pretty
picture
,
and
every
one
present
must
gaze
at
her
.
<EOS>
that
be
enough
:
she
herself
be
determined
to
see
nobody
in
particular
,
or
to
turn
her
eye
any
way
except
toward
Lady
Brackenshaw
,
but
her
thought
undeniably
turn
in
other
way
.
<EOS>
It
enter
a
little
into
her
pleasure
that
Herr
Klesmer
must
be
observe
her
at
a
moment
when
music
be
out
of
the
question
,
and
his
superiority
very
far
in
the
back
-
ground
;
for
vanity
be
as
ill
at
ease
under
indifference
as
tenderness
be
under
a
love
which
it
can
not
return
;
and
the
unconquered
Klesmer
throw
a
trace
of
his
malign
power
even
across
her
pleasant
consciousness
that
Mr.
Grandcourt
be
see
her
to
the
utmost
advantage
,
and
be
probably
give
her
an
admiration
unmixed
with
criticism
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
expect
to
admire
_
him
_
,
but
that
be
not
necessary
to
her
peace
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
meet
Lady
Brackenshaw
's
gracious
smile
without
blush
(
which
only
come
to
her
when
she
be
take
by
surprise
)
,
but
with
a
charming
gladness
of
expression
,
and
then
bent
with
easy
grace
to
have
the
star
fix
near
her
shoulder
.
<EOS>
that
little
ceremony
have
be
over
long
enough
for
her
to
have
exchange
playful
speech
and
receive
congratulation
as
she
move
among
the
group
who
be
now
interesting
themselves
in
the
result
of
the
scoring

but
it
happen
that
she
stand
outside
examine
the
point
of
an
arrow
with
rather
an
absent
air
when
Lord
Brackenshaw
come
up
to
her
and
say
:
  
"

the
beginning

acquaintance
whether
with
person

to
    
get
a
definite
outline
for

<EOS>
Mr.
Grandcourt
's
wish
to
be
introduce
have
no
suddenness
for
Gwendolen

but
when
Lord
Brackenshaw
move
aside
a
little
for
the
prefigure
stranger
to
come
forward
<EOS>
and
she
feel
herself
face

there
be
a
little
shock
which
flush
her
cheek
and
vexatiously
deepen
with

the
shock
come
from
the
reversal
of
her
expectation
:
Grandcourt
could
hardly
have
be
more
unlike
all
her
imaginary
portrait
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
slightly
tall
than
herself
,
and
their
eye
seem
to
be
on
a
level
;
there
be
not
the
faint
smile
on
his
face
as
he
look
at
her
,
not
a
trace
of
self
-
consciousness
or
anxiety
in
his
bearing
:
when
he
raise
his
hat
he
show
an
extensive
baldness
surround
with
a
mere
fringe
of
reddish
-
blonde
hair
,
but
he
also
show
a
perfect
hand
;
the
line
of
feature
from
brow
to
chin
undisguised
by
beard
be
decidedly
handsome
,
with
only
moderate
departure
from
the
perpendicular
,
and
the
slight
whisker
too
be
perpendicular
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
possible
for
a
human
aspect
to
be
free
from
grimace
or
solicitous
wriggling
:
also
it
be
perhaps
not
possible
for
a
breathing
man
wide
awake
to
look
less
animated
.
<EOS>
the
correct
Englishman
,
draw
himself
up
from
his
bow
into
rigidity
,
assent
severely
,
and
seem
to
be
in
a
state
of
internal
drill
,
suggest
a
suppress
vivacity
,
and
may
be
suspect
of
let
go
with
some
violence
when
he
be
release
from
parade
;
but
Grandcourt
's
bearing
have
no
rigidity
,
it
incline
rather
to
the
flaccid
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
have
a
fade
fairness
resemble
that
of
an
actress
when
bare
of
the
artificial
white
and
red
;
his
long
narrow
gray
eye
express
nothing
but
indifference
.
<EOS>
attempt
at
description
be
stupid
:
who
can
all
at
once
describe
a
human
being
?
<EOS>
even
when
he
be
present
to
us
we
only
begin
that
knowledge
of
his
appearance
which
must
be
complete
by
innumerable
impression
under
differ
circumstance
.
<EOS>
We
recognize
the
alphabet
;
we
be
not
sure
of
the
language
.
<EOS>
I
be
only
mention
the
point
that
Gwendolen
see
by
the
light
of
a
prepared
contrast
in
the
first
minute
of
her
meeting
with
Grandcourt
:
they
be
sum
up
in
the
word
,
"
He
be
not
ridiculous
.
"
<EOS>
but
forthwith
Lord
Brackenshaw
be
go
,
and
what
be
call
conversation
have
begin
,
the
first
and
constant
element
in
it
be
that
Grandcourt
look
at
Gwendolen
persistently
with
a
slightly
explore
gaze
,
but
without
change
of
expression
,
while
she
only
occasionally
look
at
him
with
a
flash
of
observation
a
little
soften
by
coquetry
.
<EOS>
also
,
after
her
answer
there
be
a
long
or
short
pause
before
he
speak
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
use
to
think
archery
be
a
great
bore
,
"
Grandcourt
begin
.
<EOS>
He
speak
with
a
fine
accent
,
but
with
a
certain
break
drawl
,
as
of
a
distinguished
personage
with
a
distinguished
cold
on
his
chest
.
  
<EOS>

Gwendolen

Pause

change
the

not
that
the
_

be
quite
disagreeable
to

but
while
it
last
she
apparently
could
not
get
rid
of
the
unwonted
flush
in
her
cheek
and
the
sense
of
surprise
which
make
her
feel
less
mistress
of

than
usual

and
this
Mr.

who
seem
to
feel
his

importance
more
than
he

for

her

there
be
now
a
lively
movement
in

which

the

along
with

who
choose

be
go
on
around

observe
that
Grandcourt
be
have
Klesmer
present
to
him
by
some
one
unknown
to
her
 
a
middle

aged
man
,
with
dark
,
full
face

fat
hand
,
who
seem
to
be
on
the
easy
term
with
both
,
and
presently
lead
the
way
in
join
the
Arrowpoints
,
whose
acquaintance
have
already
be
make
by
both
him

Grandcourt

<EOS>
who
this
stranger
be
she
do
not
care
much
to
know
;
but
she
wish
to
observe
what
be
Grandcourt
's
manner
toward
other
than
herself

<EOS>
precisely
the
same
:
except
that
he
do
not
look
much
at
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
but
rather
at
Klesmer
,
who
be
speak
with
animation
 
now
stretch
out
his
long
finger
horizontally
,
now
point
downward
with
his
fore
-
finger
,
now
fold
his
arm
and
toss
his
mane
,
while
he
address
himself
first
to
one
and
then
to
the
other
,
include
Grandcourt
,
who
listen
with
an
impassive
face
and
narrow
eye
,
his
left
fore
-
finger
in
his
waistcoat
-
pocket
,
and
his
right
slightly
touch
his
thin
whisker
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
which
style
Miss
Arrowpoint
admire
most
,
"
be
a
thought
that
glance
through
Gwendolen
's
mind
,
while
her
eye
and
lip
gather
rather
a
mock
expression
.
<EOS>
but
she
would
not
indulge
her
sense
of
amusement
by
watch
,
as
if
she
be
curious
,
and
she
give
all
her
animation
to
those
immediately
around
her
,
determine
not
to
care
whether
Mr.
Grandcourt
come
near
her
again

not

<EOS>
He
do
not
come
,
however
,
and
at
a
moment
when
he
could
propose
to
conduct
Mrs.
Davilow
to
her
carriage
,
"
Shall
we
meet
again
in
the
ball
-
room
?

"
<EOS>
she
say
as
he
raise
his
hat
at
parting
.
<EOS>
the
"
yes
"
in
reply
have
the
usual
slight
drawl
and
perfect
gravity
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
wrong
for
once

say
Mrs.
Davilow
,
during
their
few
minute
'
drive
to
the
castle
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
what
,
mamma
?
"
  
"
about
Mr.
Grandcourt
's
appearance
and
manner
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
find
anything
ridiculous
in
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
could
if
I
try
,
but
I
do
not
want
to
do
it
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
rather
pettishly
;
and
her
mother
be
afraid
to
say
more
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
rule
on
these
occasion
for
the
lady
and
gentleman
to
dine
apart
,
so
that
the
dinner
may
make
a
time
of
comparative
ease
and
rest
for
both
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
gentleman
have
a
set
of
archery
story
about
the
epicurism
of
the
lady
,
who
have
somehow
be
report
to
show
a
revolt
masculine
judgment
in
venison
,
even
ask
for
the
fat
 
a
proof
of
the
frightful
rate
at
which
corruption
may
go
on
in
woman
,
but
for
severe
social
restraint
,
and
every
year
the
amiable
Lord
Brackenshaw
,
who
be
something
of
a
_
gourmet
_
,
mention
Byron
's
opinion
that
a
woman
should
never
be
see
eat
,
 
introduce
it
with
a
confidential
 
<EOS>
"
the
fact
be
"
as
if
he
be
for
the
first
time
admit
his
concurrence
in
that
sentiment
of
the
refined
poet
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
lady
'
dining
-
room
it
be
evident
that
Gwendolen
be
not
a
general
favorite
with
her
own
sex
:
there
be
no
beginning
of
intimacy
between
her
and
other
girl
,
and
in
conversation
they
rather
notice
what
she
say
than
speak
to
her
in
free
exchange
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
that
she
be
not
much
interested
in
them
,
and
when
leave
alone
in
their
company
have
a
sense
of
empty
bench
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vulcany
once
remark
that
Miss
Harleth
be
too
fond
of
the
gentleman
;
but
we
know
that
she
be
not
in
the
least
fond
of
them
 
<EOS>
she
be
only
fond
of
their
homage
 
and
woman
do
not
give
her
homage
.
<EOS>
the
exception
to
this
willing
aloofness
from
her
be
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
who
often
manage
unostentatiously
to
be
by
her
side
,
and
talk
to
her
with
quiet
friendliness
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
know

as
I
do
,
that
our
friend
be
ready
to
quarrel
over
a
husband
for
us
,
"
think
Gwendolen
,
"
and
she
be
determined
not
to
enter
into
the
quarrel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
Miss
Arrowpoint
have
the
good
manner
I
ever
see
,
"
say
Mrs.
Davilow
,
when
she
and
Gwendolen
be
in
a
dressing
-
room
with
Mrs.
Gascoigne
and
Anna
,
but
at
a
distance
where
they
could
have
their
talk
apart
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
be
like
her
,
"
say
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
?
<EOS>
be
you
get
discontent
with
yourself
,
Gwen
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
but
I
be
discontent
with
thing
.
<EOS>
She
seem
contented
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
you
ought
to
be
satisfied
to
-
day

<EOS>
You
must
have
enjoy
the
shooting

<EOS>
I
see
you
do

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
that
be
over
now

I
do
not
know
what
will
come
next

say
Gwendolen
,
stretch
herself
with
a
sort
of
moan
and
throw
up
her
arm
.
<EOS>
They
be
bare
now
;
it
be
the
fashion
to
dance
in
the
archery
dress
,
throw
off
the
jacket
;
and
the
simplicity
of
her
white
cashmere
with
its
border
of
pale
green
set
off
her
form
to
the
utmost
.
<EOS>
a
thin
line
of
gold
round
her
neck
,
and
the
gold
star
on
her
breast
,
be
her
only
ornament
.
<EOS>
Her
smooth
soft
hair
pile
up
into
a
grand
crown
make
a
clear
line
about
her
brow
.
<EOS>
Sir
Joshua
would
have
be
glad
to
take
her
portrait
;
and
he
would
have
have
an
easy
task
than
the
historian
at
least
in
this
,
that
he
would
not
have
have
to
represent
the
truth
of
change
 
only
to
give
stability
to
one
beautiful
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
dancing
will
come
next
,
"
say
Mrs.
Davilow
<EOS>
"
You
be
sure
to
enjoy
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
only
dance
in
the
quadrille
.
<EOS>
I
tell
Mr.
Clintock
so
.

I
shall
not
waltz
or
polk
with
any
one

why
in

world
do
you
say
that
all
on
a
sudden

I
can
not

have
ugly
people
so
near

Mrs.

Mrs.

to
her
sister
who
now
come
up
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
.
"
<EOS>
Gwendolen
say
she
will
not
waltz
or
polk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
rather
give
to
whim
,
I
think
,
"
say
Mrs.
Gascoigne
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
more
become
in
her
to
behave
as
other
young
lady
do
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
;
especially
when
she
have
have
the
advantage
of
first

rate
dancing
lesson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
I
dance
if
I
do

It

<EOS>
"
My

!

say
Mrs.
Gascoigne
,
in
a
tone
of
severe
check
,
and
Anna
look
frightened
at
Gwendolen
's
daring
.
<EOS>
but
they
all
pass
on
without
say
any
more
.
  
<EOS>
apparently
something
have
change
Gwendolen
's
mood
since
the
hour
of
exult
enjoyment
in
the
archery
-
ground
.
<EOS>
but
she
do
not
look
the
bad
under
the
chandelier
in
the
ball
-
room
,
where
the
soft
splendor
of
the
scene
and
the
pleasant
odor
from
the
conservatory
could
not
but
be
soothe
to
the
temper
,
when
accompany
with
the
consciousness
of
be
preeminently
seek
for
.
<EOS>
hardly
a
dancing
man
but
be
anxious
to
have
her
for
a
partner
,
and
each
whom
she
accept
be
in
a
state
of
melancholy
remonstrance
that
she
would
not
waltz
or
polk
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
under
a
vow
,
Miss
Harleth
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
be
you
so
cruel
to
us
all
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
waltz
with
me
in
February
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
you
who
waltz
so
perfectly
!
"
be
exclamation
not
without
piquancy
for
her
.
<EOS>
the
lady
who
waltz
naturally
think
that
Miss
Harleth
only
want
to
make
herself
particular
;
but
her
uncle
when
he
overhear
her
refusal
support
her
by
say
    
<EOS>
"
Gwendolen
have
usually
good
reason
.
"
<EOS>
He
think
she
be
certainly
more
distinguished
in
not
waltz
,
and
he
wish
her
to
be
distinguish
.
<EOS>
the
archery
ball
be
intend
to
be
keep
at
the
subdued
pitch
that
suit
all
dignity
clerical
and
secular
;
it
be
not
an
escapement
for
youthful
high
spirit
,
and
he
himself
be
of
opinion
that
the
fashionable
dance
be
too
much
of
a
romp
.
  
<EOS>
among
the
remonstrant
dancing
man
,
however
,
Mr.
Grandcourt
be
not
number
.
<EOS>
after
stand
up
for
a
quadrille
with
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
it
seem
that
he
mean
to
ask
for
no
other
partner
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
observe
him
frequently
with
the
Arrowpoints
,
but
he
never
take
an
opportunity
of
approach
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
be
sometimes
speak
to
him
;
but
Mr.
Gascoigne
be
everywhere
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
her
mind
now
that
she
would
probably
after
all
not
have
the
least
trouble
about
him
:
perhaps
he
have
look
at
her
without
any
particular
admiration
,
and
be
too
much
use
to
everything
in
the
world
to
think
of
her
as
more
than
one
of
the
girl
who
be
invite
in
that
part
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
of
course
!
<EOS>
It
be
ridiculous
of
elder
to
entertain
notion
about
what
a
man
would
do
,
without
have
see
him
even
through
a
telescope
.
<EOS>
probably
he
mean
to
marry
Miss
Arrowpoint
.
<EOS>
whatever
may
come
,
she
,
Gwendolen
,
be
not
go
to
be
disappoint
:
the
affair
be
a
joke
whichever
way
it
turn
,
for
she
have
never
commit
herself
even
by
a
silent
confidence
in
anything
Mr.
Grandcourt
would
do
.
<EOS>
still
,
she
notice
that
he
do
sometimes
quietly
and
gradually
change
his
position
accord
to
hers
,
so
that
he
could
see
her
whenever
she
be
dance
,
and
if
he
do
not
admire
her
 
so
much
the
bad
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
this
movement
for
the
sake
of
be
in
sight
of
her
be
more
direct
than
usual
rather
late
in
the
evening
,
when
Gwendolen
have
accept
Klesmer
as
a
partner
;
and
that
wide
-
glance
personage
,
who
see
everything
and
nothing
by
turn
,
say
to
her
when
they
be
walk
,
"
Mr.
Grandcourt
be
a
man
of
taste
.
<EOS>
He
like
to
see
you
dance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
he
like
to
look
at
what
be
against
his
taste
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
with
a
light
laugh
<EOS>
;
she
be
quite
courageous
with
Klesmer
now
.
"
<EOS>
He
may
be
so
tired
of
admire
that
he
like
disgust
for
variety
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
those
word
be
not
suitable
to
your
lip
,
"
say
Klesmer
,
quickly
,
with
one
of
his
grand
frown
,
while
he
shake
his
hand
as
if
to
banish
the
discordant
sound
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
as
critical
of
word
as
of
music
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
I
be
.
<EOS>
I
should
require
your
word
to
be
what
your
face
and
form
be
 
always
among
the
meaning
of
a
noble
music
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
compliment
as
well
as
a
correction
.
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
for
both
.
<EOS>
but
do
you
know
I
be
bold
enough
to
wish
to
correct
_
you
_
,
and
require
you
to
understand
a
joke
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
one
may
understand
joke
without
like
them
,
"
say
the
terrible
Klesmer
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
have
opera
book
send
me
full
of
joke
;
it
be
just
because
I
understand
them
that
I
do
not
like
them
.
<EOS>
the
comic
people
be
ready
to
challenge
a
man
because
he
look
grave
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
see
the
witticism
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
,
but
I
see
what
you
mean
.
<EOS>
"
then
I
be
what
we
call
ticket
as
a
fellow
without
_
esprit
_
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
fact
,
"
say
Klesmer
,
suddenly
drop
from
his
quick
narrative
to
a
reflective
tone
,
with
an
impressive
frown
,
"
I
be
very
sensible
to
wit
and
humor

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
you
tell
me
that
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
not
without
some
wickedness
of
intention
.
<EOS>
but
Klesmer
's
thought
have
fly
off
on
the
wing
of
his
own
statement
,
as
their
habit
be
,
and
she
have
the
wickedness
all
to
herself
.
<EOS>
"
pray
,
who
be
that

near
the
card

she
go
on
,
see
there
the
same
stranger
with
whom
Klesmer
have
be
in
animate
talk
on
the
archery
ground

<EOS>
He

a
friend
of
yours

no

no

Klesmer
be
conquer
,
and
flash
at
her
a
delightful
smile
which
make
them
quite
friendly
until
she
beg
to
be
deposit
by
the
side

afterward

I

for

She
be

punish
Mr.

tardiness

yet
at
the

time
she
would
have

She
give
him
a
charming
smile

she
look
up

deliver

answer

he
stand
still

down
at

unfortunate
in

late

after
a
moment
's
pause

"
It
seem
to
me

no

here

smile
gently

return
Grandcourt

after
the
usual
pause

and
without
change
of
tone

clearly
he
know
what
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
think

observe
after
a
little

"
I

"

"
I

very
pardonable

"
there
must

Lady

up

the

as
Gwendolen
stand
up
for
the
quadrille
with
Grandcourt
,
there
be
a
revival
in
her
of
the
exultation
 
<EOS>
the
sense
of
carry
everything
before
her
,
which
she
have
feel
earlier
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
no
man
could
have
walk
through
the
quadrille
with
more
irreproachable
ease
than
Grandcourt
;
and
the
absence
of
all
eagerness
in
his
attention
to
her
suited
his
partner
's
taste
.
<EOS>
She
be
now
convinced
that
he
mean
to
distinguish
her
,
to
mark
his
admiration
of
her
in
a
noticeable
way
;
and
it
begin
to
appear
probable
that
she
would
have
it
in
her
power
to
reject
him
,
whence
there
be
a
pleasure
in
reckon
up
the
advantage
which
would
make
her
rejection
splendid
,
and
in
give
Mr.
Grandcourt
his
utmost
value
.
<EOS>
It
be
also
agreeable
to
divine
that
this
exclusive
selection
of
her
to
dance
with
,
from
among
all
the
unmarried
lady
present
,
would
attract
observation
;
though
she
studiously
avoid
see
this
,
and
at
the
end
of
the
quadrille
walk
away
on
Grandcourt
's
arm
as
if
she
have
be
one
of
the
short
sight
instead
of
the
long
and
wide
sight
of
mortal
.
<EOS>
They
encounter
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
who
be
stand
with
Lady
Brackenshaw
and
a
group
of
gentleman
.
<EOS>
the
heiress
look
at
Gwendolen
invitingly
and
say
,
"
I
hope
you
will
vote
with
us
,
Miss
Harleth
,
and
Mr.
Grandcourt
too
,
though
he
be
not
an
archer
.
"
<EOS>
Gwendolen
and
Grandcourt
pause
to
join
the
group
,
and
find
that
the
voting
turn
on
the
project
of
a
picnic
archery
meeting
to
be
hold
in
Cardell
Chase
,
where
the
evening
entertainment
would
be
more
poetic
than
a
ball
under
,
chandelier
 
a
feast
of
sunset
light
along
the
glade
and
through
the
branch
and
over
the
solemn
tree
-
top
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
think
the
scheme
delightful
 
equal
to
play
Robin
Hood
and
Maid
Marian
:
and
Mr.
Grandcourt
,
when
appeal
to
a
second
time
,
say
it
be
a
thing
to
be
do
;
whereupon
Mr.
Lush
,
who
stand
behind
Lady
Brackenshaw
's
elbow
,
draw
Gwendolen
's
notice
by
say
with
a
familiar
look
and
tone
to
Grandcourt
,
"
Diplow
would
be
a
good
place
for
the
meeting
,
and
more
convenient
:
there
be
a
fine
bit
between
the
oak
toward
the
north
gate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
impossible
to
look
more
unconscious
of
be
address
than
Grandcourt
;
but
Gwendolen
take
a
new
survey
of
the
speaker
,
decide
,
first
,
that
he
must
be
on
term
of
intimacy
with
the
tenant
of
Diplow
,
and
,
secondly
,
that
she
would
never
,
if
she
could
help
it
,
let
him
come
within
a
yard
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
subject
to
physical
antipathy
,
and
Mr.
Lush
's
prominent
eye
,
fat
though
not
clumsy
figure
,
and
strong
black
gray
-
besprinkled
hair
of
frizzy
thickness
,
which
,
with
the
rest
of
his
prosperous
person
,
be
enviable
to
many
,
create
one
of
the
strong
of
her
antipathy
.
<EOS>
to
be
safe
from
his
looking
at
her
,
she
murmur
to
Grandcourt
,
"
I
should
like
to
continue
walk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
obey
immediately
;
but
when
they
be
thus
away
from
any
audience
,
he
speak
no
word
for
several
minute
,
and
she
,
out
of
a
half
-
amused
,
half
-
serious
inclination
for
experiment
,
would
not
speak
first
.
<EOS>
They
turn
into
the
large
conservatory
,
beautifully
light
up
with
chinese
lamp
.
<EOS>
the
other
couple
there
be
at
a
distance
which
would
not
have
interfere
with
any
dialogue
,
but
still
they
walk
in
silence
until
they
have
reach
the
farther
end
where
there
be
a
flush
of
pink
light
,
and
the
second
wide
opening
into
the
ball
-
room
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
,
when
they
have
half
turn
round
,
pause
and
say
languidly
    
"
do
you
like
this
kind
of
thing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
if
the
situation
have
be
describe
to
Gwendolen
half
an
hour
before
,
she
would
have
laugh
heartily
at
it
,
and
could
only
have
imagine
herself
return
a
playful
,
satirical
answer
.
<EOS>
but
for
some
mysterious
reason
 
it
be
a
mystery
of
which
she
have
a
faint
wondering
consciousness
 
<EOS>
she
dare
not
be
satirical
:
she
have
begin
to
feel
a
wand
over
her
that
make
her
afraid
of
offend
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
she
say
,
quietly
,
without
consider
what
"
kind
of
thing
"
be
mean
 
whether
the
flower
,
the
scent
,
the
ball
in
general
,
or
this
episode
of
walk
with
Mr.
Grandcourt
in
particular
.
<EOS>
and
they
return
along
the
conservatory
without
farth
interpretation
.
<EOS>
She
then
propose
to
go
and
sit
down
in
her
old
place
,
and
they
walk
among
scatter
couple
prepare
for
the
waltz
to
the
spot
where
Mrs.
Davilow
have
be
seat
all
the
evening
.
<EOS>
as
they
approach
it
her
seat
be
vacant
,
but
she
be
come
toward
it
again
,
and
,
to
Gwendolen
's
shudder
annoyance
,
with
Mr.
Lush
at
her
elbow
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
avoid
the
confrontation
:
her
mamma
come
close
to
her
before
they
have
reach
the
seat
,
and
,
after
a
quiet
greeting
smile
,
say
innocently
,
"
Gwendolen
,
dear
,
let
me
present
Mr.
Lush
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
have
just
make
the
acquaintance
of
this
personage
,
as
an
intimate
and
constant
companion
of
Mr.
Grandcourt
's
,
Mrs.
Davilow
imagine
it
altogether
desirable
that
her
daughter
also
should
make
the
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
a
bow
that
Gwendolen
give
 
rather
<EOS>
,
it
be
the
slight
forward
sweep
of
the
head
away
from
the
physiognomy
that
incline
itself
toward
her
,
and
she
immediately
move
toward
her
seat
,
say
,
"
I
want
to
put
on
my
burnous
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
sooner
have
she
reach
it
,
than
Mr.
Lush
be
there
,
and
have
the
burnous
in
his
hand
:
to
annoy
this
supercilious
young
lady
,
he
would
incur
the
offense
of
forestall
Grandcourt
;
and
,
hold
up
the
garment
close
to
Gwendolen
,
he
say
,
"
pray
,
permit
me
?
"
<EOS>
but
she
,
wheel
away
from
him
as
if
he
have
be
a
muddy
hound
,
glide
on
to
the
ottoman
,
say
,
"
no
,
thank
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
man
who
forgave
this
would
have
much
christian
feeling
,
suppose
he
have
intend
to
be
agreeable
to
the
young
lady
;
but
before
he
seize
the
burnous
Mr.
Lush
have
cease
to
have
that
intention
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
quietly
take
the
drapery
from
him
,
and
Mr.
Lush
,
with
a
slight
bow
,
move
away
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
perhaps
better
put
it
on
,
"
say
Mr.
Grandcourt
,
look
down
on
her
without
change
of
expression
.
  
<EOS>
"
thank
;
perhaps
it
would
be
wise
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
rise
,
and
submit
very
gracefully
to
take
the
burnous
on
her
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
after
that
,
Mr.
Grandcourt
exchange
a
few
polite
speech
with
Mrs.
Davilow
,
and
,
in
take
leave
,
ask
permission
to
call
at
Offendene
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
He
be
evidently
not
offend
by
the
insult
direct
toward
his
friend
.
<EOS>
certainly
Gwendolen
's
refusal
of
the
burnous
from
Mr.
Lush
be
open
to
the
interpretation
that
she
wish
to
receive
it
from
Mr.
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
but
she
,
poor
child
,
have
no
design
in
this
action
,
and
be
simply
follow
her
antipathy
and
inclination
,
confide
in
them
as
she
do
in
the
more
reflective
judgment
into
which
they
enter
as
sap
into
leafage
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
have
no
sense
that
these
man
be
dark
enigmas
to
her
,
or
that
she
need
any
help
in
draw
conclusion
about
them
 
Mr.
Grandcourt
at
least
.
<EOS>
the
chief
question
be
,
how
far
his
character
and
way
may
answer
her
wish
;
and
unless
she
be
satisfied
about
that
,
she
have
say
to
herself
that
she
would
not
accept
his
offer
.
  
<EOS>
Could
there
be
a
slenderer
,
more
insignificant
thread
in
human
history
than
this
consciousness
of
a
girl
,
busy
with
her
small
inference
of
the
way
in
which
she
could
make
her
life
pleasant
?
 
<EOS>
in
a
time
,
too
,
when
idea
be
with
fresh
vigor
make
army
of
themselves
,
and
the
universal
kinship
be
declare
itself
fiercely
;
when
woman
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
would
not
mourn
for
the
husband
and
son
who
die
bravely
in
a
common
cause
,
and
man
stint
of
bread
on
our
side
of
the
world
hear
of
that
willing
loss
and
be
patient
:
a
time
when
the
soul
of
man
be
walk
to
pulse
which
have
for
century
be
beat
in
him
unfelt
,
until
their
full
sum
make
a
new
life
of
terror
or
of
joy
.
  
<EOS>
what
in
the
midst
of
that
mighty
drama
be
girl
and
their
blind
vision
?
<EOS>
They
be
the
Yea
or
Nay
of
that
good
for
which

and

<EOS>
in
these
delicate
vessel

onward
through
the
age
the
treasure

human
affection

"
o

the

on

second
day
after
the
Archery
Meeting

Mr.
Henleigh
Mallinger
Grandcourt
be
at
his
breakfast
-
table
with
Mr.
Lush
.
<EOS>
everything
around
them
be
agreeable
:
the
summer
air
through
the
open
window
,
at
which
the
dog
could
walk
in
from
the
old
green
turf
on
the
lawn
;
the
soft
,
purplish
coloring
of
the
park
beyond
,
stretch
toward
a
mass
of
border
wood
;
the
still
life
in
the
room
,
which
seem
the
stiller
for
its
sober
antiquated
elegance
,
as
if
it
keep
a
conscious
,
well
-
breed
silence
,
unlike
the
restlessness
of
vulgar
furniture
.
  
<EOS>
whether
the
gentleman
be
agreeable
to
each
other
be
less
evident
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grandcourt
have
draw
his
chair
aside
so
as
to
face
the
lawn
,
and
with
his
left
leg
over
another
chair
,
and
his
right
elbow
on
the
table
,
be
smoke
a
large
cigar
,
while
his
companion
be
still
eat
.
<EOS>
the
dog
 
half
-
a
-
dozen
of
various
kind
be
move
lazily
in
and
out
,
take
attitude
of
brief
attention
 
give
a
vacillate
preference
first
to
one
gentleman
,
then
to
the
other
;
be
dog
in
such
good
circumstance
that
they
could
play
at
hunger
,
and
like
to
be
serve
with
delicacy
which
they
decline
to
put
in
their
mouth
;
all
except
Fetch
,
the
beautiful
liver
-
color
water
-
spaniel
,
which
sit
with
its
forepaw
firmly
plant
and
its
expressive
brown
face
turn
upward
,
watch
Grandcourt
with
unshaken
constancy
.
<EOS>
He
hold
in
his
lap
a
tiny
maltese
dog
with
a
tiny
silver
collar
and
bell
,
and
when
he
have
a
hand
unused
by
cigar
or
coffee
-
cup
,
it
rest
on
this
small
parcel
of
animal
warmth
.
<EOS>
I
fear
that
Fetch
be
jealous
,
and
wound
that
her
master
give
her
no
word
or
look
;
at
last
it
seem
that
she
could
bear
this
neglect
no
longer
,
and
she
gently
put
her
large
silky
paw
on
her
master
's
leg
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
look
at
her
with
unchanged
face
for
half
a
minute
,
and
then
take
the
trouble
to
lay
down
his
cigar
while
he
lift
the
unimpassioned
Fluff
close
to
his
chin
and
give
it
caress
pat
,
all
the
while
gravely
watch
Fetch
,
who
,
poor
thing
,
whimper
interruptedly
,
as
if
try
to
repress
that
sign
of
discontent
,
and
at
last
rest
her
head
beside
the
appealing
paw
,
look
up
with
piteous
beseeching
.
<EOS>
so
,
at
least
,
a
lover
of
dog
must
have
interpret
Fetch
,
and
Grandcourt
keep
so
many
dog
that
he
be
repute
to
love
them
;
at
any
rate
,
his
impulse
to
act
just
in
that
way
start
from
such
an
interpretation
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
amusing
anguish
burst
forth
in
a
howling
bark
,
Grandcourt
push
Fetch
down
without
speak
,
and
,
deposit
Fluff
carelessly
on
the
table
(
where
his
black
nose
predominate
over
a
salt
-
cellar
)
,
begin
to
look
to
his
cigar
,
and
find
,
with
some
annoyance
against
Fetch
as
the
cause
,
that
the
brute
of
a
cigar
require
relighting
.
<EOS>
Fetch
,
have
begin
to
wail
,
find
,
like
other
of
her
sex
,
that
it
be
not
easy
to
leave
off
;
indeed
,
the
second
howl
be
a
loud
one
,
and
the
third
be
like
unto
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
turn
out
that
brute
,
will
you
?
"
say
Grandcourt
to
Lush
,
without
raise
his
voice
or
look
at
him
 
as
if
he
count
on
attention
to
the
small
sign
.
  
<EOS>
and
Lush
immediately
rise
,
lift
Fetch
,
though
she
be
rather
heavy
,
and
he
be
not
fond
of
stooping
,
and
carry
her
out
,
dispose
of
her
in
some
way
that
take
him
a
couple
of
minute
before
he
return
.
<EOS>
He
then
light
a
cigar
,
place
himself
at
an
angle
where
he
could
see
Grandcourt
's
face
without
turn
,
and
presently
say
    
"
Shall
you
ride

<EOS>
Grandcourt
smoke
in
silence
for
half
a
minute

then
say
    
"
I
suppose
you
send
my
card
and
inquiry
.

"

"
I
go
myself
at
four

silence

"
why
do
you
ask

<EOS>
when

You
invite
the

yourself

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
have
my
meeting
them
in
Paris
to
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
I
tell
you
to
give
me
a
list
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
,
like
many
other
,
have
two
remarkably
different
voice
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
we
have
hear
him
speak
in
a
superficial
interrupt
drawl
<EOS>
suggestive
chiefly
of
languor
and
_
<EOS>
ennui
_
.
<EOS>
but
this
last
brief
speech
be
utter
in
subdued
inward
,
yet
distinct
,
tone
,
which
Lush
have
long
be
use
to
recognize
as
the
expression
of
a
peremptory
will
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
there
any
other
couple
you
would
like
to
invite
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
think
of
some
decent
people
,
with
a
daughter
or
two
.
<EOS>
and
one
of
your
damned
musician
.
<EOS>
but
not
a
comic
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
if
Klesmer
would
consent
to
come
to
us
when
he
leave
Quetcham
.
<EOS>
nothing
but
first
-
class
music
will
go
down
with
Miss
Arrowpoint
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lush
speak
carelessly
,
but
he
be
really
seize
an
opportunity
and
fix
an
observant
look
on
Grandcourt
,
who
now
for
the
first
time
,
turn
his
eye
toward
his
companion
,
but
slowly
and
without
speak
until
he
have
give
two
long
luxuriant
puff
,
when
he
say
,
perhaps
in
a
low
tone
than
ever
,
but
with
a
perceptible
edge
of
contempt
    
<EOS>
"
what
in
the
name
of
nonsense
have
I
to
do
with
Miss
Arrowpoint
and
her
music
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
something
,
"
say
Lush
,
jocosely
.
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
give
yourself
much
trouble
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
but
some
form
must
be
go
through
before
a
man
can
marry
a
million
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
likely
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
go
to
marry
a
million
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
pity
 
to
fling
away
an
opportunity
of
this
sort
,
and
knock
down
your
own
plan
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
Your
_
plan
,
I
suppose
you
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
some
debt

you
know

may
turn
out
inconveniently
after
all

<EOS>
the
heirship
be
not

absolutely
_
certain

"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
do
not
answer
,
and
Lush
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
really
be
a
fine
opportunity
.
<EOS>
the
father
and
mother
ask
for
nothing
well
,
I
can
see
,
and
the
daughter
's
look
and
manner
require
no
allowance
,
any
more
than
if
she
have
not
a
sixpence
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
beautiful
;
but
equal
to
carry
any
rank

<EOS>
and
she
be
not
likely
to
refuse
such
prospect

you
can
offer
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
father

would
let
you
do
anything
you

<EOS>
"
but
I
should
not
like
to
do
anything
with
them

"
  
<EOS>
here
it
be
Lush
who
make
a
little
pause
before
speak
again
,
and
then
he
say
in
a
deep
voice
of
remonstrance
,
"
<EOS>
good
God
,
Grandcourt
!
<EOS>
after
your
experience

will
you
let
a
whim
interfere

I
know

go
to
do

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
?
"
<EOS>
Lush
put
down
his
cigar
and
thrust
his
hand
into
his
side
pocket
,
as
if
he
have
to
face
something
exasperating
,
but
mean
to
keep
his
temper
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
to
marry
the
other
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
have
you
fall
in
love
?
"
<EOS>
this
question
carry
a
strong
sneer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
make
her
an
offer
already
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
a
young
lady
with
a
will
of
her
own

I
fancy
.
<EOS>
extremely
well
fitted
to
make
a
rumpus
.
<EOS>
She
would
know
what
she
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
do
not
like
you

"
say
Grandcourt
,
with
the
ghost
of
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
perfectly
true
,
"
say
Lush
,
add
again
in
a
markedly
sneer
tone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
however
,
if
you
and
she
be
devoted
to
each
other
,
that
will
be
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
take
no
notice
of
this
speech
,
but
sip
his
coffee
,
rise
,
and
stroll
out
on
the
lawn
,
all
the
dog
follow
him
.
  
<EOS>
Lush
glance
after
him
a
moment
,
then
resume
his
cigar
and
light
it
,
but
smoke
slowly
,
consult
his
beard
with
inspect
eye
and
finger
,
till
he
finally
stroke
it
with
an
air
of
have
arrive
at
some
conclusion
,
and
say
in
a
subdue
voice
    
"
check
,
old
boy
!
"
  
<EOS>
Lush
,
be
a
man
of
some
ability
,
have
not
know
Grandcourt
for
fifteen
year
without
learn
what
sort
of
measure
be
useless
with
him
,
though
what
sort
may
be
useful
remain
often
dubious
.
<EOS>
in
the
beginning
of
his
career
he
hold
a
fellowship
,
and
be
near
take
order
for
the
sake
of
a
college
living
,
but
not
be
fond
of
that
prospect
accept
instead
the
office
of
travel
companion
to
a
marquess
,
and
afterward
to
young
Grandcourt
,
who
have
lose
his
father
early
,
and
who
find
Lush
so
convenient
that
he
have
allow
him
to
become
prime
minister
in
all
his
more
personal
affair
.
<EOS>
the
habit
of
fifteen
year
have
make
Grandcourt
more
and
more
in
need
of
Lush
's
handiness
,
and
Lush
more
and
more
in
need
of
the
lazy
luxury
to
which
his
transaction
on
behalf
of
Grandcourt
make
no
interruption
worth
reckoning
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
the
same
lengthen
habit
have
intensify
Grandcourt
's
want
of
respect
for
his
companion
since
that
want
have
be
absolute
from
the
beginning
,
but
it
have
confirm
his
sense
that
he
may
kick
Lush
if
he
choose
 
only
he
never
do
choose
to
kick
any
animal
,
because
the
act
of
kicking
be
a
compromising
attitude
,
and
a
gentleman
's
dog
should
be
kick
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
only
say
thing
which
may
have
expose
himself
to
be
kick
if
his
confidant
have
be
a
man
of
independent
spirit
.
<EOS>
but
what
son
of
a
vicar
who
have
stint
his
wife
and
daughter
of
calico
in
order
to
send
his
male
offspring
to
Oxford
,
can
keep
an
independent
spirit
when
he
be
bent
on
dining
with
high
discrimination
,
ride
good
horse
,
live
generally
in
the
most
luxuriant
honey
-
blossomed
clover
 
and
all
without
work
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Lush
have
pass
for
a
scholar
once
,
and
have
still
a
sense
of
scholarship
when
he
be
not
try
to
remember
much
of
it
;
but
the
bachelor
's
and
other
art
which
soften
manner
be
a
time
-
honor
preparation
for
sinecure
;
and
Lush
's
present
comfortable
provision
be
as
good
a
sinecure
in
not
require
more
than
the
odor
of
depart
learning
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
unconscious
of
be
hold
kickable
,
but
he
prefer
count
that
estimate
among
the
peculiarity
of
Grandcourt
's
character
,
which
make
one
of
his
incalculable
mood
or
judgment
as
good
as
another
.
<EOS>
since
in
his
own
opinion
he
have
never
do
a
bad
action
,
it
do
not
seem
necessary
to
consider
whether
he
should
be
likely
to
commit
one
if
his
love
of
ease
require
it
.
<EOS>
Lush
's
love
of
ease
be
well
-
satisfied
at
present
,
and
if
his
pudding
be
roll
toward
him
in
the
dust
,
he
take
the
inside
bit
and
find
them
relish
.
  
<EOS>
this
morning
,
for
example
,
though
he
have
encounter
more
annoyance
than
usual
,
he
go
to
his
private
sitting
-
room
and
play
a
good
hour
on
the
violoncello
.
      
<EOS>
"
Philistia
,
be
thou
glad
of
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
Grandcourt
have
make
up
his
mind
to
marry
Miss
Harleth
,
show
a
power
of
adapt
mean
to
end
.
<EOS>
during
the
next
fortnight
there
be
hardly
a
day
on
which
by
some
arrangement
or
other
he
do
not
see
her
,
or
prove
by
emphatic
attention
that
she
occupy
his
thought
.
<EOS>
His
cousin
,
Mrs.
Torrington
,
be
now
do
the
honor
of
his
house
,
so
that
Mrs.
Davilow
and
Gwendolen
could
be
invite
to
a
large
party
at
Diplow
in
which
there
be
many
witness
how
the
host
distinguish
the
dowerless
beauty
,
and
show
no
solicitude
about
the
heiress
.
<EOS>
the
world
 
<EOS>
I
mean
Mr.
Gascoigne
and
all
the
family
worth
speak
of
within
visit
distance
of
Pennicote
 
feel
an
assurance
on
the
subject
which
in
the
rector
's
mind
convert
itself
into
a
resolution
to
do
his
duty
by
his
niece
and
see
that
the
settlement
be
adequate
.
<EOS>
indeed
the
wonder
to
him
and
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
be
that
the
offer
for
which
so
many
suitable
occasion
present
themselves
have
not
be
already
make
;
and
in
this
wonder
Grandcourt
himself
be
not
without
a
share
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
tell
his
resolution
to
Lush
he
have
think
that
the
affair
would
be
conclude
more
quickly
,
and
to
his
own
surprise
he
have
repeatedly
promise
himself
in
a
morning
that
he
would
to
-
day
give
Gwendolen
the
opportunity
of
accept
him
,
and
have
find
in
the
evening
that
the
necessary
formality
be
still
unaccomplishe
.
<EOS>
this
remarkable
fact
serve
to
heighten
his
determination
on
another
day
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
admit
to
himself
that
Gwendolen
may
refuse
him
,
but
 
heaven
help
us
all
!
 
<EOS>
we
be
often
unable
to
act
on
our
certainty
;
our
objection
to
a
contrary
issue
(
be
it
possible
)
be
so
strong
that
it
rise
like
a
spectral
illusion
between
us
and
our
certainty
;
we
be
rationally
sure
that
the
blind
worm
can
not
bite
us
mortally
,
but
it
would
be
so
intolerable
to
be
bite
,
and
the
creature
have
a
biting
look
 
we
decline
to
handle
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
ask
leave
to
have
a
beautiful
horse
of
his
brought
for
Gwendolen
to
ride
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
be
to
accompany
her
in
the
carriage
,
and
they
be
to
go
to
Diplow
to
lunch
,
Grandcourt
conduct
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
fine
mid
-
harvest
time
,
not
too
warm
for
a
noonday
ride
of
five
mile
to
be
delightful
;
the
poppy
glow
on
the
border
of
the
field
,
there
be
enough
breeze
to
move
gently
like
a
social
spirit
among
the
ear
of
uncut
corn
,
and
to
wing
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
across
the
soft
gray
down
;
here
the
sheaf
be
stand
,
there
the
horse
be
strain
their
muscle
under
the
last
load
from
a
wide
space
of
stubble
,
but
everywhere
the
green
pasture
make
a
broad
set
for
the
corn
-
field
,
and
the
cattle
take
their
rest
under
wide
branch
.
<EOS>
the
road
lie
through
a
bit
of
country
where
the
dairy
-
farm
look
much
as
they
do
in
the
day
of
our
forefather
 
where
peace
and
permanence
seem
to
find
a
home
away
from
the
busy
change
that
send
the
railway
train
fly
in
the
distance
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
spirit
of
peace
and
permanence
do
not
penetrate
poor
Mrs.
Davilow
's
mind
so
as
to
overcome
her
habit
of
uneasy
foreboding
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
and
Grandcourt
canter
in
front
of
her
,
and
then
slacken
their
pace
to
a
conversational
walk
till
the
carriage
come
up
with
them
again
,
make
a
gratify
sight
;
but
it
serve
chiefly
to
keep
up
the
conflict
of
hope
and
fear
about
her
daughter
's
lot
.
<EOS>
here
be
an
irresistible
opportunity
for
a
lover
to
speak
and
put
an
end
to
all
uncertainty
,
and
Mrs.
Davilow
could
only
hope
with
tremble
that
Gwendolen
's
decision
would
be
favorable
.
<EOS>
certainly
if
Rex
's
love
have
be
repugnant
to
her
,
Mr.
Grandcourt
have
the
advantage
of
be
in
complete
contrast
with
Rex
;
and
that
he
have
produce
some
quite
novel
impression
on
her
seem
evident
in
her
marked
abstinence
from
satirical
observation
,
nay
,
her
total
silence
about
his
characteristic
,
a
silence
which
Mrs.
Davilow
do
not
dare
to
break
.
<EOS>
"
be
he
a
man
she
would
be
happy
with
?
"
 
be
a
question
that
inevitably
arise
in
the
mother
's
mind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
perhaps
as
happy
as
she
would
be
with
any
one
else
 
or
<EOS>
as
most
other
woman
be
"
 
be
the
answer
with
which
she
try
to
quiet
herself
;
for
she
could
not
imagine
Gwendolen
under
the
influence
of
any
feeling
which
would
make
her
satisfied
in
what
we
traditionally
call
"
mean
circumstance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
's
own
thought
be
look
in
the
same
direction
:
he
want
to
have
do
with
the
uncertainty
that
belong
to
his
not
have
speak
.
<EOS>
as
to
any
further
uncertainty
 
well
,
it
be
something
without
any
reasonable
basis
,
some
quality
in
the
air
which
act
as
an
irritant
to
his
wish
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
enjoy
the
riding
,
but
her
pleasure
do
not
break
forth
in
girlish
unpremeditated
chat
and
laughter
as
it
do
on
that
morning
with
Rex
.
<EOS>
She
speak
a
little
,
and
even
laugh
,
but
with
a
lightness
as
of
a
far
-
off
echo
:
<EOS>
for
her
too
there
be
some
peculiar
quality
in
the
air
 
not
<EOS>
,
she
be
sure
,
any
subjugation
of
her
will
by
Mr.
Grandcourt
,
and
the
splendid
prospect
he
mean
to
offer
her
;
for
Gwendolen
desire
every
one
,
that
dignified
gentleman
himself
include
,
to
understand
that
she
be
go
to
do
just
as
she
like
,
and
that
they
have
well
not
calculate
on
her
please
them
.
<EOS>
if
she
choose
to
take
this
husband
,
she
would
have
him
know
that
she
be
not
go
to
renounce
her
freedom
,
or
accord
to
her
favorite
formula
,
"
not
go
to
do
as
other
woman
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
's
speech
this
morning
be
,
as
usual
,
all
of
that
brief
sort
which
never
fail
to
make
a
conversational
figure
when
the
speaker
be
hold
important
in
his
circle
.
<EOS>
stop
so
soon
,
they
give
sign
of
a
suppress
and
formidable

<EOS>
so
say
more

also
the
meritorious
quality

allow
lengthiness
to
other

<EOS>
"
how
do
you
like
Criterion
's
pace
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
after
they
have
enter
the
park
and
be
slack
from
a
canter
to
a
walk
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
delightful
to
ride
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
have
a
leap
with
him
,
if
it
would
not
frighten
mamma
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
good
wide
channel
we
pass
five
minute
ago
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
have
a
gallop
back
and
take
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
pray
do
.
<EOS>
We
can
take
it
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
thank
.
<EOS>
Mamma
be
so
timid
 
<EOS>
if
she
see
me
it
may
make
her
ill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
go
and
explain
.
<EOS>
criterion
would
take
it
without
fail
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
 
indeed
 
you
be
very
kind
 
<EOS>
but
it
would
alarm
her
too
much
.
<EOS>
I
dare
take
any
leap
when
she
be
not
by
;
but
I
do
it
and
do
not
tell
her
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
can
let
the
carriage
pass
and
then
set
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
pray
do
not
think
of
it
any
more
:
I
speak
quite
randomly
,
"
say
Gwendolen
;
she
begin
to
feel
a
new
objection
to
carry
out
her
own
proposition
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
Mrs.
Davilow
know
I
shall
take
care
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
but
she
would
think
of
you
as
have
to
take
care
of
my
broken
neck
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
considerable
pause
before
Grandcourt
say
,
look
toward
her
,
"
I
should
like
to
have
the
right
always
to
take
care
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
do
not
turn
her
eye
on
him
;
it
seem
to
her
a
long
while
that
she
be
first
blush
,
and
then
turn
pale
,
but
to
Grandcourt
's
rate
of
judgment
she
answer
soon
enough
,
with
the
light
flute
-
tone
and
a
careless
movement
of
the
head
,
"
oh
,
I
be
not
sure
that
I
want
to
be
take
care
of
:
if
I
choose
to
risk
break
my
neck
,
I
should
like
to
be
at
liberty
to
do
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
check
her
horse
as
she
speak
,
and
turn
in
her
saddle
,
look
toward
the
advance
carriage
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
sweep
across
Grandcourt
as
she
make
this
movement
,
but
there
be
no
language
in
them
to
correct
the
carelessness
of
her
reply
.
<EOS>
at
that
very
moment
she
be
aware
that
she
be
risk
something
 
not
her
neck
,
but
the
possibility
of
finally
check
Grandcourt
's
advance
,
and
she
do
not
feel
contented
with
the
possibility
.
  
<EOS>
"
damn
her
!
"
think
Grandcourt
,
as
he
too
check
his
horse
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
wordy
thinker
,
and
this
explosive
phrase
stand
for
mixed
impression
which
eloquent
interpreter
may
have
expand
into
some
sentence
full
of
an
irritated
sense
that
he
be
be
mystify
,
and
a
determination
that
this
girl
should
not
make
a
fool
of
him
.
<EOS>
do
she
want
him
to
throw
himself
at
her
foot
and
declare
that
he
be
die
for
her
?
<EOS>
It
be
not
by
that
gate
that
she
could
enter
on
the
privilege
he
could
give
her
.
<EOS>
or
do
she
expect
him
to
write
his
proposal
?
<EOS>
equally
a
delusion
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
make
his
offer
in
any
way
that
could
place
him
definitely
in
the
position
of
be
reject
.
<EOS>
but
as
to
her
accept
him
,
she
have
do
it
already
in
accept
his
marked
attention
:
and
anything
which
happen
to
break
them
off
would
be
understand
to
her
disadvantage
.
<EOS>
She
be
merely
coquet
,
then
?
  
<EOS>
however
,
the
carriage
come
up
,
and
no
further
_
tete
-
à
-
tete
_
could
well
occur
before
their
arrival
at
the
house
,
where
there
be
abundant
company
,
to
whom
Gwendolen
,
clothe
in
riding
-
dress
,
with
her
hat
lay
aside
,
clothe
also
in
the
repute
of
be
choose
by
Mr.
Grandcourt
,
be
naturally
a
centre
of
observation
;
and
since
the
objectionable
Mr.
Lush
be
not
there
to
look
at
her
,
this
stimulus
of
admire
attention
heighten
her
spirit
,
and
disperse
,
for
the
time
,
the
uneasy
consciousness
of
divided
impulse
which
threaten
her
with
repentance
of
her
own
act
.
<EOS>
whether
Grandcourt
have
be
offend
or
not
there
be
no
judging
:
his
manner
be
unchanged
,
but
Gwendolen
's
acuteness
have
not
go
deep
than
to
discern
that
his
manner
be
no
clue
for
her
,
and
because
these
be
unchanged
<EOS>
she
be
not
the
less
afraid
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
not
be
at
Diplow
before
except
to
dine
;
and
since
certain
point
of
view
from
the
window
and
the
garden
be
worth
show
,
Lady
Flora
Hollis
propose
after
luncheon
,
when
some
of
the
guest
have
disperse
,
and
the
sun
be
slope
toward
four
o'clock
,
that
the
remain
party
should
make
a
little
exploration
.
<EOS>
here
come
frequent
opportunity
when
Grandcourt
may
have
retain
Gwendolen
apart
,
and
have
speak
to
her
unheard
.
<EOS>
but
no
!
<EOS>
He
indeed
speak
to
no
one
else
,
but
what
he
say
be
nothing
more
eager
or
intimate
than
it
have
be
in
their
first
interview
.
<EOS>
He
look
at
her
not
less
than
usual
;
and
some
of
her
defiant
spirit
have
come
back
,
she
look
full
at
him
in
return
,
not
care
 
rather
prefer
 
that
his
eye
have
no
expression
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
but
at
last
it
seem
as
if
he
entertain
some
contrivance
.
<EOS>
after
they
have
nearly
make
the
tour
of
the
ground
,
the
whole
party
stop
by
the
pool
to
be
amuse
with
Fetch
's
accomplishment
of
bring
a
water
lily
to
the
bank
like
Cowper
's
spaniel
Beau
,
and
have
be
disappoint
in
his
first
attempt
insist
on
his
try
again
.
  
<EOS>
here
Grandcourt
,
who
stand
with
Gwendolen
outside
the
group
,
turn
deliberately
,
and
fix
his
eye
on
a
knoll
plant
with
american
shrub
,
and
have
a
wind
path
up
it
,
say
languidly
    
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
bore
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
go
up
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
certainly
 
since
we
be
explore
,
"
say
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
She
be
rather
pleased
,
and
yet
afraid
.
  
<EOS>
the
path
be
too
narrow
for
him
to
offer
his
arm
,
and
they
walk
up
in
silence
.
<EOS>
when
they
be
on
the
bit
of
platform
at
the
summit
,
Grandcourt
say
    
"
there
be
nothing
to
be
see
here
:
the
thing
be
not
worth
climb
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
how
be
it
that
Gwendolen
do
not
laugh
?
<EOS>
She
be
perfectly
silent
,
hold
up
the
fold
of
her
robe
like
a
statue
,
and
give
a
hard
grasp
to
the
handle
of
her
whip
,
which
she
have
snatch
up
automatically
with
her
hat
when
they
have
first
set
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
sort
of
a
place
do
you
prefer
?
"
say
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
"
different
place
be
agreeable
in
their
way
.
<EOS>
on
the
whole
,
I
think
,
I
prefer
place
that
be
open
and
cheerful
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
fond
of
anything
sombre
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
place
of
Offendene
be
too
sombre
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
,
rather
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
remain
there
long
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
I
think
so
.
<EOS>
mamma
like
to
be
near
her
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
silence
for
a
short
space
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
_
you
_
will
always
live
there
,
though
Mrs.
Davilow
may
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
We
woman
can
not
go
in
search
of
adventure
 
to
find
out
the
North
-
West
Passage
or
the
source
of
the
Nile
,
or
to
hunt
tiger
in
the
East
.
<EOS>
We
must
stay
where
we
grow
,
or
where
the
gardener
like
to
transplant
us
.
<EOS>
We
be
bring
up
like
the
flower
,
to
look
as
pretty
as
we
can
,
and
be
dull
without
complain
.
<EOS>
that
be
my
notion
about
the
plant
;
they
be
often
bored
,
and
that
be
the
reason
why
some
of
them
have
get
poisonous
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
Gwendolen
have
run
on
rather
nervously
,
lightly
whip
the
rhododendron
bush
in
front
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
quite
agree
.
<EOS>
Most
thing
be
bore
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
his
mind
have
be
push
into
an
easy
current
,
away
from
its
intended
track
.
<EOS>
but
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
he
continue
in
his
break
,
refined
drawl
    
<EOS>
"
but
a
woman
can
be
marry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
some
woman
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
,
certainly
,
unless
you
be
obstinately
cruel
.
"
  
"
I
be
not
sure
that
I
be
not
both
cruel
and
obstinate
.
"
<EOS>
here
Gwendolen
suddenly
turn
her
head
and
look
full
at
Grandcourt
,
whose
eye
she
have
feel
to
be
upon
her
throughout
their
conversation
.
<EOS>
She
be
wonder
what
the
effect
of
look
at
him
would
be
on
herself
rather
than
on
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
stand
perfectly
still
,
half
a
yard
or
more
away
from
her
;
and
it
flash
through
her
mind
what
a
sort
of
lotus
-
eater
's
stupor
have
begin
in
him
and
be
take
possession
of
her
.
<EOS>
then
he
say
    
"
be
you
as
uncertain
about
yourself
as
you
make
other
about
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
quite
uncertain
about
myself
;
I
do
not
know
how
uncertain
other
may
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
wish
them
to
understand
that
you
do
not
care
?
"
say
Grandcourt
,
with
a
touch
of
new
hardness
in
his
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
say
that
,
"
Gwendolen
reply
,
hesitatingly
,
and
turn
her
eye
away
whip
the
rhododendron
bush
again
.
<EOS>
She
wish
she
be
on
horseback
that
she
may
set
off
on
a
canter
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
set
off
run
down
the
knoll
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
care
,
then
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
not
more
quickly
,
<EOS>
but
with
a
softened
drawl
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
my
whip
!
<EOS>
"
say
Gwendolen
,
in
a
little
scream
of
distress
.
<EOS>
She
have
let
it
go
 
<EOS>
what
could
be
more
natural
in
a
slight
agitation
?
 
<EOS>
and
 
<EOS>
but
this
seem
less
natural
in
a
gold
-
handle
whip
which
have
be
leave
altogether
to
itself
 
<EOS>
it
have
go
with
some
force
over
the
immediate
shrub
,
and
have
lodge
itself
in
the
branch
of
an
azalea
half
-
way
down
the
knoll
.
<EOS>
She
could
run
down
now
,
laugh
prettily
,
and
Grandcourt
be
oblige
to
follow
;
but
she
be
beforehand
with
him
in
rescue
the
whip
,
and
continue
on
her
way
to
the
level
ground
,
when
she
pause
and
look
at
Grandcourt
with
an
exasperating
brightness
in
her
glance
and
a
heighten
color
,
as
if
she
have
carry
a
triumph
,
and
these
indication
be
still
noticeable
to
Mrs.
Davilow
when
Gwendolen
and
Grandcourt
join
the
rest
of
the
party
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
coquet
,
"
think
Grandcourt
;
"
the
next
time
I
beckon
she
will
come
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
seem
to
him
likely
that
this
final
beckoning
may
happen
the
very
next
day
,
when
there
be
to
be
a
picnic
archery
meeting
in
Cardell
Chase
,
accord
to
the
plan
project
on
the
evening
of
the
ball
.
  
<EOS>
even
in
Gwendolen
's
mind
<EOS>
that
result
be
one
of
two
likelihood
that
present
themselves
alternately
,
one
of
two
decision
toward
which
she
be
be
precipitate
,
as
if
they
be
two
side
of
a
boundary
-
line
,
and
she
do
not
know
on
which
she
should
fall
.
<EOS>
this
subjection
to
a
possible
self
,
a
self
not
to
be
absolutely
predict
about
,
cause
her
some
astonishment
and
terror
;
her
favorite
key
of
life
 
do
as
she
like
 
seem
to
fail
her
,
and
she
could
not
foresee
what
at
a
give
moment
she
may
like
to
do
.
<EOS>
the
prospect
of
marry
Grandcourt
really
seem
more
attractive
to
her
than
she
have
believe
beforehand
that
any
marriage
could
be
:
<EOS>
the
dignity
,
the
luxury
,
the
power
of
do
a
great
deal
of
what
she
like
to
do
,
which
have
now
come
close
to
her
,
and
within
her
choice
to
secure
or
to
lose
,
take
hold
of
her
nature
as
if
it
have
be
the
strong
odor
of
what
she
have
only
imagine
and
long
for
before
.
<EOS>
and
Grandcourt
himself
?
<EOS>
He
seem
as
little
of
a
flaw
in
his
fortune
as
a
lover
and
husband
could
possibly
be
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
wish
to
mount
the
chariot
and
drive
the
plunge
horse
herself
,
with
a
spouse
by
her
side
who
would
fold
his
arm
and
give
her
his
countenance
without
look
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
certainly
,
with
all
her
perspicacity
,
and
all
the
reading
which
seem
to
her
mamma
dangerously
instructive
,
her
judgment
be
consciously
a
little
at
fault
before
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
He
be
adorably
quiet
and
free
from
absurdity
 
he
would
be
a
husband
to
suit
with
the
good
appearance
a
woman
could
make
.
<EOS>
but
what
else
be
he
?
<EOS>
He
have
be
everywhere
,
and
see
everything
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
that
_
be
desirable
,
and
especially
gratify
as
a
preamble
to
his
supreme
preference
for
Gwendolen
Harleth
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
appear
to
enjoy
anything
much
.
<EOS>
that
be
not
necessary
:
and
the
less
he
have
of
particular
taste
,
or
desire
,
the
more
freedom
his
wife
be
likely
to
have
in
follow
her
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
conceive
that
after
marriage
she
would
most
probably
be
able
to
manage
him
thoroughly
.
  
<EOS>
how
be
it
that
he
cause
her
unusual
constraint
now
?
 
<EOS>
that
she
be
less
daring
and
playful
in
her
talk
with
him
than
with
any
other
admirer
she
have
know
?
<EOS>
that
absence
of
demonstrativeness
which
she
be
glad
of
,
act
as
a
charm
in
more
sense
than
one
,
and
be
slightly
benumb
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
after
all
be
formidable
 
a
handsome
lizard
of
a
hitherto
unknown
specie
,
not
of
the
lively
,
dart
kind
.
<EOS>
but
Gwendolen
know
hardly
anything
about
lizard
,
and
ignorance
give
one
a
large
range
of
probability
.
<EOS>
this
splendid
speciman
be
probably
gentle
,
suitable
as
a
boudoir
pet
:
<EOS>
what
may
not
a
lizard
be
,
if
you
know
nothing
to
the
contrary
?
<EOS>
Her
acquaintance
with
Grandcourt
be
such
that
no
accomplishment
suddenly
reveal
in
him
would
have
surprise
her
.
<EOS>
and
he
be
so
little
suggestive
of
drama
,
that
it
hardly
occur
to
her
to
think
with
any
detail
how
his
life
of
thirty
-
six
year
have
be
pass
:
in
general
,
she
imagine
him
always
cold
and
dignified
,
not
likely
ever
to
have
commit
himself
.
<EOS>
He
have
hunt
the
tiger
 
<EOS>
have
he
ever
be
in
love
or
make
love
?
<EOS>
the
one
experience
and
the
other
seem
alike
remote
in
Gwendolen
's
fancy
from
the
Mr.
Grandcourt
who
have
come
to
Diplow
in
order
apparently
to
make
a
chief
epoch
in
her
destiny
 
perhaps
by
introduce
her
to
that
state
of
marriage
which
she
have
resolve
to
make
a
state
of
great
freedom
than
her
girlhood
.
<EOS>
and
on
the
whole
she
wish
to
marry
him
;
he
suit
her
purpose
;
her
prevailing
,
deliberate
intention
be
,
to
accept
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
be
she
go
to
fulfill
her
deliberate
intention
?
<EOS>
She
begin
to
be
afraid
of
herself
,
and
to
find
out
a
certain
difficulty
in
do
as
she
like
.
<EOS>
already
her
assertion
of
independence
in
evade
his
advance
have
be
carry
farther
than
be
necessary
,
and
she
be
think
with
some
anxiety
what
she
may
do
on
the
next
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
seat
accord
to
her
habit
with
her
back
to
the
horse
on
their
drive
homeward
,
she
be
completely
under
the
observation
of
her
mamma
,
who
take
the
excitement
and
changefulness
in
the
expression
of
her
eye
,
her
unwonted
absence
of
mind
and
total
silence
,
as
unmistakable
sign
that
something
unprecedented
have
occur
between
her
and
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
's
uneasiness
determine
her
to
risk
some
speech
on
the
subject
:
the
gascoigne
be
to
dine
at
Offendene
,
and
in
what
have
occur
this
morning
there
may
be
some
reason
for
consult
the
rector
;
not
that
she
expect
him
anymore
than
herself
to
influence
Gwendolen
,
but
that
her
anxious
mind
want
to
be
disburden
.
  
<EOS>
"
something
have
happen
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
she
begin
,
in
a
tender
tone
of
question
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
look
round
,
and
seem
to
be
rouse
to
the
consciousness
of
her
physical
self
,
take
off
her
glove
and
then
her
hat
,
that
the
soft
breeze
may
blow
on
her
head
.
<EOS>
They
be
in
a
retired
bit
of
the
road
,
where
the
long
afternoon
shadow
from
the
bordering
tree
fall
across
it
and
no
observer
be
within
sight
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
continue
to
meet
her
mother
's
,
but
she
do
not
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Grandcourt
have
be
say
something
?
 
<EOS>
tell
me
,
dear
.
<EOS>
"
the
last
word
be
utter
beseechingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
I
to
tell
you
,
mamma
?
<EOS>
"
be
the
perverse
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
something
have
agitate
you
.
<EOS>
You
ought
to
confide
in
me
,
Gwen
.
<EOS>
You
ought
not
to
leave
me
in
doubt
and
anxiety
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
's
eye
fill
with
tear
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mamma
,
dear
,
please
do
not
be
miserable
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
with
pettish
remonstrance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
only
make
me
more
so
.
<EOS>
I
be
in
doubt
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
about
Mr.
Grandcourt
's
intention
?
"
say
Mrs.
Davilow
,
gather
determination
from
her
alarm
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
not
at
all
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
with
some
curtness
,
and
a
pretty
little
toss
of
the
head
as
she
put
on
her
hat
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
about
whether
you
will
accept
him
,
then
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
precisely
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
give
him
a
doubtful
answer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
give
him
no
answer
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
_
have
_
speak
so
that
you
could
not
misunderstand
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
far
as
I
would
let
him
speak
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
expect
him
to
persevere
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
put
this
question
rather
anxiously
,
and
receive
no
answer
,
ask
another
:
"
You
do
not
consider
that
you
have
discourage
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
like
him
,
dear
,
"
say
Mrs.
Davilow
,
timidly
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
do
,
mamma
,
as
like
go
.
<EOS>
there
be
less
to
dislike
about
him
than
about
most
man
.
<EOS>
He
be
quiet
and
_
distingué
_
.
"
<EOS>
Gwendolen
so
far
speak
with
a
pouting
sort
of
gravity
;
but
suddenly
she
recover
some
of
her
mischievousness
,
and
her
face
break
into
a
smile
as
she
add
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
he
have
all
the
quality
that
would
make
a
husband
tolerable
 
battlement
,
veranda
,
stable
,
etc
.
,
no
grin
and
no
glass
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
be
serious
with
me
for
a
moment
,
dear
.
<EOS>
be
I
to
understand
that
you
mean
to
accept
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
pray
,
mamma
,
leave
me
to
myself
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
with
a
pettish
distress
in
her
voice
.
  
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Davilow
say
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
get
home
Gwendolen
declare
that
she
would
not
dine
.
<EOS>
She
be
tired
,
and
would
come
down
in
the
evening
after
she
have
take
some
rest
.
<EOS>
the
probability
that
her
uncle
would
hear
what
have
pass
do
not
trouble
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
convince
that
whatever
he
may
say
would
be
on
the
side
of
her
accept
Grandcourt
,
and
she
wish
to
accept
him
if
she
could
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
she
would
willingly
have
have
weight
hang
on
her
own
caprice
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
do
hear
 
not
Gwendolen
's
answer
repeat
verbatim
,
but
a
softened
generalize
account
of
them
.
<EOS>
the
mother
convey
as
vaguely
as
the
keen
rector
's
question
would
let
her
the
impression
that
Gwendolen
be
in
some
uncertainty
about
her
own
mind
,
but
incline
on
the
whole
to
acceptance
.
<EOS>
the
result
be
that
the
uncle
feel
himself
call
on
to
interfere
;
he
do
not
conceive
that
he
should
do
his
duty
in
witholde
direction
from
his
niece
in
a
momentous
crisis
of
this
kind
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
venture
a
hesitating
opinion
that
perhaps
it
would
be
safe
to
say
nothing
 
<EOS>
Gwendolen
be
so
sensitive
(
she
do
not
like
to
say
willful
)
.
<EOS>
but
the
rector
's
be
a
firm
mind
,
grasp
its
first
judgment
tenaciously
and
act
on
them
promptly
<EOS>
,
whence
counter
-
judgment
be
no
more
for
him
than
shadow
fleet
across
the
solid
ground
to
which
he
adjust
himself
.
  
<EOS>
this
match
with
Grandcourt
present
itself
to
him
as
a
sort
of
public
affair
;
perhaps
there
be
way
in
which
it
may
even
strengthen
the
establishment
.
<EOS>
to
the
rector
,
whose
father
(
nobody
would
have
suspect
it
,
and
nobody
be
tell
)
have
rise
to
be
a
provincial
corn
-
dealer
,
aristocratic
heirship
resemble
regal
heirship
in
except
its
possessor
from
the
ordinary
standard
of
moral
judgment
,
Grandcourt
,
the
almost
certain
baronet
,
the
probable
peer
,
be
to
be
range
with
public
personage
,
and
be
a
match
to
be
accept
on
broad
general
ground
national
and
ecclesiastical
.
<EOS>
such
public
personage
,
it
be
true
,
be
often
in
the
nature
of
giant
which
an
ancient
community
may
have
feel
pride
and
safety
in
possessing
,
though
,
regard
privately
,
these
bear
eminence
must
often
have
be
inconvenient
and
even
noisome
.
<EOS>
but
of
the
future
husband
personally
Mr.
Gascoigne
be
dispose
to
think
the
good
.
<EOS>
gossip
be
a
sort
of
smoke
that
come
from
the
dirty
tobacco
-
pipe
of
those
who
diffuse
it
:
it
prove
nothing
but
the
bad
taste
of
the
smoker
.
<EOS>
but
if
Grandcourt
have
really
make
any
deep
or
more
unfortunate
experiment
in
folly
than
be
common
in
young
man
of
high
prospect
,
he
be
of
an
age
to
have
finish
them
.
<EOS>
all
account
can
be
suitably
wind
up
when
a
man
have
not
ruin
himself
,
and
the
expense
may
be
take
as
an
insurance
against
future
error
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
view
of
practical
wisdom
;
with
reference
to
high
view
,
repentance
have
a
supreme
moral
and
religious
value
.
<EOS>
there
be
every
reason
to
believe
that
a
woman
of
well
-
regulate
mind
would
be
happy
with
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
no
surprise
to
Gwendolen
on
come
down
to
tea
to
be
tell
that
her
uncle
wish
to
see
her
in
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
He
throw
aside
the
paper
as
she
enter
and
greet
her
with
his
usual
kindness
.
<EOS>
as
his
wife
have
remark
,
he
always
"
make
much
"
of
Gwendolen
,
and
her
importance
have
rise
of
late
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
he
say
,
in
a
fatherly
way
,
move
a
chair
for
her
as
he
hold
her
hand
,
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
on
a
subject
which
be
more
momentous
than
any
other
with
regard
to
your
welfare
.
<EOS>
You
will
guess
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
but
I
shall
speak
to
you
with
perfect
directness
:
in
such
matter
I
consider
myself
bind
to
act
as
your
father
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
objection
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
,
no
,
uncle
.
<EOS>
You
have
always
be
very
kind
to
me
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
frankly
.
<EOS>
this
evening
she
be
willing
,
if
it
be
possible
,
to
be
a
little
fortified
against
her
troublesome
self
,
and
her
resistant
temper
be
in
abeyance
.
<EOS>
the
rector
's
mode
of
speech
always
convey
a
thrill
of
authority
,
as
of
a
word
of
command
:
it
seem
to
take
for
grant
that
there
could
be
no
wavering
in
the
audience
,
and
that
every
one
be
go
to
be
rationally
obedient
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
naturally
a
satisfaction
to
me
that
the
prospect
of
a
marriage
for
you
 
advantageous
in
the
high
degree
 
have
present
itself
so
early
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
exactly
what
have
pass
between
you
and
Mr.
Grandcourt
,
but
I
presume
there
can
be
little
doubt
,
from
the
way
in
which
he
have
distinguish
you
,
that
he
desire
to
make
you
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
do
not
speak
immediately
,
and
her
uncle
say
with
more
emphasis
    
<EOS>
"
have
you
any
doubt
of
that
yourself
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
that
be
what
he
have
be
think
of
.
<EOS>
but
he
may
have
change
his
mind
to
-
morrow
,
"
say
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
have
he
make
advance
which
you
have
discourage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
mean
 
he
begin
to
make
advance
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
encourage
them
.
<EOS>
I
turn
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Will
you
confide
in
me
so
far
as
to
tell
me
your
reason
?
"
  
"
I
be
not
sure
that
I
have
any
reason
,
uncle
.
"
<EOS>
Gwendolen
laugh
rather
artificially
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
quite
capable
of
reflect
,
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
You
be
aware
that
this
be
not
a
trivial
occasion
,
and
it
concern
your
establishment
for
life
under
circumstance
which
may
not
occur
again
.
<EOS>
You
have
a
duty
here
both
to
yourself
and
your
family
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
understand
whether
you
have
any
ground
for
hesitating
as
to
your
acceptance
of
Mr.
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
hesitate
without
ground
.
"
<EOS>
Gwendolen
speak
rather
poutingly
,
and
her
uncle
grow
suspicious
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
he
disagreeable
to
you
personally
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
hear
anything
of
him
which
have
affect
you
disagreeably
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
rector
think
it
impossible
that
Gwendolen
could
have
hear
the
gossip
he
have
hear
,
but
in
any
case
he
must
endeavor
to
put
all
thing
in
the
right
light
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
nothing
about
him
except
that
he
be
a
great
match
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
with
some
sauciness
;
"
and
that
affect
me
very
agreeably
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
my
dear
Gwendolen
,
I
have
nothing
further
to
say
than
this
:
you
hold
your
fortune
in
your
own
hand
 
a
fortune
such
as
<EOS>
rarely
happen
to
a
girl
in
your
circumstance
 
a
fortune
in
fact
which
almost
take
the
question
out
of
the
range
of
mere
personal
feeling
,
and
make
your
acceptance
of
it
a
duty
.
<EOS>
if
Providence
offer
you
power
and
position
 
especially
when
unclogged
by
any
condition
that
be
repugnant
to
you
 
<EOS>
your
course
be
one
of
responsibility
,
into
which
caprice
must
not
enter
.
<EOS>
a
man
do
not
like
to
have
his
attachment
trifle
with
:
he
may
not
be
at
once
repel
 
<EOS>
these
thing
be
matter
of
individual
disposition
.
<EOS>
but
the
trifling
may
be
carry
too
far
.
<EOS>
and
I
must
point
out
to
you
that
in
case
Mr.
Grandcourt
be
repel
without
your
have
refuse
him
 
without
your
have
intend
ultimately
to
refuse
him
,
your
situation
would
be
a
humiliating
and
painful
one
.
<EOS>
I
,
for
my
part
,
should
regard
you
with
severe
disapprobation
,
as
the
victim
of
nothing
else
than
your
own
coquetry
and
folly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
become
pallid
as
she
listen
to
this
admonitory
speech
.
<EOS>
the
idea
it
raise
have
the
force
of
sensation
.
<EOS>
Her
resistant
courage
would
not
help
her
here
,
because
her
uncle
be
not
urge
her
against
her
own
resolve
;
he
be
press
upon
her
the
motive
of
dread
which
she
already
feel
;
he

make
her
more
conscious
of
the
risk
that
lie
within
herself
.
<EOS>
She
be
silent
,
and
the
rector
observe
that
he
have
produce
some
strong
effect
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
this
in
kindness
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
tone
have
soften
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
aware
of
that
,
uncle
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
rise
and
shake
her
head
back
,
as
if
to
rouse
herself
out
of
painful
passivity
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
foolish
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
I
must
be
marry
some
time
 
before
it
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
see
how
I
could
do
better
than
marry
Mr.
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
accept
him
,
if
possible
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
feel
as
if
she
be
reinforce
herself
by
speak
with
this
decisiveness
to
her
uncle
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
rector
be
a
little
startled
by
<EOS>
so
bare
a
version
of
his
own
meaning
from
those
young
lip
.
<EOS>
He
wish
that
in
her
mind
his
advice
should
be
take
in
an
infusion
of
sentiment
proper
to
a
girl
,
and
such
as
be
presuppose
in
the
advice
of
a
clergyman
,
although
he
may
not
consider
them
always
appropriate
to
be
put
forward
.
<EOS>
He
wish
his
niece
park
,
carriage
,
a
title
 
everything
that
would
make
this
world
a
pleasant
abode
;
but
he
wish
her
not
to
be
cynical
 
to
be
,
on
the
contrary
,
religiously
dutiful
,
and
have
warm
domestic
affection
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Gwendolen
,
"
he
say
,
rise
also
,
and
speak
with
benignant
gravity
,
"
I
trust
that
you
will
find
in
marriage
a
new
fountain
of
duty
and
affection
.
<EOS>
marriage
be
the
only
true
and
satisfactory
sphere
of
a
woman
,
and
if
your
marriage
with
Mr.
Grandcourt
should
be
happily
decide
upon
,
you
will
have
,
probably
,
an
increase
power
,
both
of
rank
and
wealth
,
which
may
be
use
for
the
benefit
of
other
.
<EOS>
these
consideration
be
something
high
than
romance
!
<EOS>
You
be
fit
by
natural
gift
for
a
position
which
,
consider
your
birth
and
early
prospect
,
could
hardly
be
look
forward
to
as
in
the
ordinary
course
of
thing
;
and
I
trust
that
you
will
grace
it
,
not
only
by
those
personal
gift
,
but
by
a
good
and
consistent
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
mamma
will
be
the
happy
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
in
a
more
cheerful
way
,
lift
her
hand
backward
to
her
neck
and
move
toward
the
door
.
<EOS>
She
want
to
waive
those
high
consideration
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
feel
that
he
have
come
to
a
satisfactory
understanding
with
his
niece
,
and
have
further
her
happy
settlement
in
life
by
further
her
engagement
to
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
there
be
another
person
to
whom
the
contemplation
of
that
issue
have
be
a
motive
for
some
activity
,
and
who
believe
that
he
,
too
,
on
this
particular
day
have
do
something
toward
bring
about
a
favorable
decision
in
_
his
_
sense
 
which
happen
to
be
the
reverse
of
the
rector
's
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Lush
's
absence
from
Diplow
during
Gwendolen
's
visit
have
be
due
,
not
to
any
fear
on
his
part
of
meet
that
supercilious
young
lady
,
or
of
be
abash
by
her
frank
dislike
,
but
to
an
engagement
from
which
he
expect
important
consequence
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
,
in
fact
,
to
the
Wanchester
station
to
meet
a
lady
,
accompany
by
a
maid
and
two
child
,
whom
he
put
into
a
fly
,
and
afterward
follow
to
the
hotel
of
the
Golden
Keys
,
in
that
town
.
<EOS>
an
impressive
woman
,
whom
many
would
turn
to
look
at
again
in
pass
;
her
figure
be
slim
and
sufficiently
tall
,
her
face
rather
emaciate
,
so
that
its
sculpturesque
beauty
be
the
more
pronounced
,
her
crisp
hair
perfectly
black
,
and
her
large
,
anxious
eye
<EOS>
what
we
call
black
.
<EOS>
Her
dress
be
soberly
correct
,
her
age
,
perhaps
,
physically
more
advanced
than
the
number
of
year
would
imply
,
but
hardly
less
than
seven
-
and
-
thirty
.
<EOS>
an
uneasy
-
look
woman
:
her
glance
seem
to
presuppose
that
the
people
and
thing
be
go
to
be
unfavorable
to
her
,
while
she
be
,
nevertheless
,
ready
to
meet
them
with
resolution
.
<EOS>
the
child
be
lovely
 
a
dark
-
haired
girl
of
six
or
more
,
a
fair
boy
of
five
.
<EOS>
when
Lush
incautiously
express
some
surprise
at
her
have
bring
the
child
,
she
say
,
with
a
sharp
-
toned
intonation
    
"
do
you
suppose
I
should
come
wander
about
here
by
myself
?
<EOS>
why
should
I
not
bring
all
four
if
I
like
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
certainly
,
"
say
Lush
,
with
his
usual
fluent
_
nonchalance
_
.
  
<EOS>
He
stay
an
hour
or
so
in
conference
with
her
,
and
ride
back
to
Diplow
in
a
state
of
mind
that
be
at
once
hopeful
and
busily
anxious
as
to
the
execution
of
the
little
plan
on
which
his
hopefulness
be
base
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
's
marriage
to
Gwendolen
Harleth
would
not
,
he
believe
,
be
much
of
a
good
to
either
of
them
,
and
it
would
plainly
be
fraught
with
disagreeable
to
himself
.
<EOS>
but
now
he
feel
confident
enough
to
say
inwardly
,
"
I
will
take
,
nay
,
I
will
lay
odd
that
the
marriage
will
never
happen
.
<EOS>
"
      
<EOS>
I
will
not
clothe
myself
in
wreck
 
<EOS>
wear
gem
  
<EOS>
saw
from
cramp
finger
-
bone
of
woman
drown
;
  
feel
chilly
vaporous
hand
of
ireful
ghost
  
<EOS>
clutch
my
necklace
:
trick
my
maiden
breast
  
with
orphan
'
heritage
.
<EOS>
let
your
dead
love
  
marry
<EOS>
it
be
dead
.
   
<EOS>
Gwendolen
look
lovely
and
vigorous
as
a
tall
,
newly
-
open
lily
the
next
morning
:
there
be
a
reaction
of
young
energy
in
her
,
and
yesterday
's
self
-
distrust
seem
no
more
than
the
transient
shiver
on
the
surface
of
a
full
stream
.
<EOS>
the
rove
archery
match
in
Cardell
Chase
be
a
delightful
prospect
for
the
sport
's
sake
<EOS>
:
she
feel
herself
beforehand
move
about
like
a
wood
-
nymph
under
the
beech
(
in
appreciative
company
)
,
and
the
imagine
scene
lend
a
charm
to
further
advance
on
the
part
of
Grandcourt
 
not
an
impassione
lyrical
Daphnis
for
the
wood
-
nymph
,
certainly
:
but
so
much
the
well
.
<EOS>
to
-
day
Gwendolen
foresee
him
make
slow
conversational
approach
to
a
declaration
,
and
foresaw
herself
await
and
encourage
it
accord
to
the
rational
conclusion
which
she
have
express
to
her
uncle
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
come
down
to
breakfast
(
after
every
one
have
leave
the
table
except
Mrs.
Davilow
)
there
be
letter
on
her
plate
.
<EOS>
one
of
them
she
read
with
a
gathering
smile
,
and
then
hand
it
to
her
mamma
,
who
,
on
return
it
,
smile
also
,
find
new
cheerfulness
in
the
good
spirit
her
daughter
have
show
ever
since
wake
,
and
say
    
"
You
do
not
feel
inclined
to
go
a
thousand
mile
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
exactly
so
far
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
sad
omission
not
to
have
write
again
before
this
.
<EOS>
can
not
you
write
how
 
before
we
set
out
this
morning
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
so
pressing
.
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
will
do
.
<EOS>
You
see
they
leave
town
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
must
write
to
Dover
.
<EOS>
They
will
be
there
till
Monday
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Shall
I
write
for
you
,
dear
 
if
it
tease
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
do
not
speak
immediately
,
but
after
sip
her
coffee
,
answer
brusquely
,
"
oh
no
,
let
it
be
;
I
will
write
to
-
morrow
.
"
<EOS>
then
,
feel
a
touch
of
compunction
,
she
look
up
and
say
with
playful
tenderness
,
"
dear
,
old
,
beautiful
mamma
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
old
,
child
,
truly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
please
do
not
,
mamma
!
<EOS>
I
mean
old
for
darling
.
<EOS>
You
be
hardly
twenty
-
five
year
old
than
I
be
.
<EOS>
when
you
talk
in
that
way
my
life
shrivel
up
before
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
one
can
have
a
great
deal
of
happiness
in
twenty
-
five
year
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
lose
no
time
in
beginning
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
merrily
.
<EOS>
"
the
sooner
I
get
my
palace
and
coach
the
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
a
good
husband
who
adore
you
,
Gwen
,
"
say
Mrs.
Davilow
,
encouragingly
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
put
out
her
lip
saucily
and
say
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
slight
drawback
on
her
pleasure
in
start
that
the
rector
be
detain
by
magistrate
's
business
,
and
would
probably
not
be
able
to
get
to
Cardell
Chase
at
all
that
day
.
<EOS>
She
care
little
that
Mrs.
Gascoigne
and
Anna
choose
not
to
go
without
him
,
but
her
uncle
's
presence
would
have
seem
to
make
it
a
matter
of
course
that
the
decision
take
would
be
act
on
.
<EOS>
for
decision
in
itself
begin
to
be
formidable
.
<EOS>
have
come
close
to
accept
Grandcourt
,
Gwendolen
feel
this
lot
of
unhoped
-
for
fullness
round
itself
too
definitely
.
<EOS>
when
we
take
to
wish
a
great
deal
for
ourselves
,
whatever
we
get
soon
turn
into
mere
limitation
and
exclusion
.
<EOS>
still
there
be
the
reassuring
thought
that
marriage
would
be
the
gate
into
a
large
freedom
.
  
<EOS>
the
place
of
meeting
be
a
grassy
spot
call
Green
Arbor
,
where
a
bit
of
hang
wood
make
a
shelter
amphitheatre
.
<EOS>
It
be
here
that
the
coachful
of
servant
with
provision
have
to
prepare
the
picnic
meal
;
and
the
warden
of
the
Chase
be
to
guide
the
rove
archer
so
as
to
keep
them
within
the
due
distance
from
this
centre
,
and
hinder
them
from
wander
beyond
the
limit
which
have
be
fix
on
 
a
curve
that
may
be
draw
through
certain
well
-
know
point
,
such
as
the
double
Oak
,
the
Whispering
Stones
,
and
the
High
Cross
.
<EOS>
the
plan
be
to
take
only
a
preliminary
stroll
before
luncheon
,
keep
the
main
rove
expedition
for
the
more
exquisite
light
of
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
the
muster
be
rapid
enough
to
save
every
one
from
dull
moment
of
waiting
,
and
when
the
group
begin
to
scatter
themselves
through
the
light
and
shadow
make
here
by
closely
neighbor
beech
and
there
by
rarer
oak
,
one
may
suppose
that
a
painter
would
have
be
glad
to
look
on
.
<EOS>
this
rove
archery
be
far
pretty
than
the
stationary
game
,
but
success
in
shoot
at
variable
mark
be
less
favor
by
practice
,
and
the
hit
be
distribute
among
the
volunteer
archer
otherwise
than
they
would
have
be
in
target
-
shooting
.
<EOS>
from
this
cause
,
perhaps
,
as
well
as
from
the
twofold
distraction
of
be
preoccupy
and
wish
not
to
betray
her
preoccupation
,
Gwendolen
do
not
greatly
distinguish
herself
in
these
first
experiment
,
unless
it
be
by
the
lively
grace
with
which
she
take
her
comparative
failure
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
white
and
green
as
on
the
day
of
the
former
meeting
,
when
it
make
an
epoch
for
her
that
she
be
introduce
to
Grandcourt
;
he
be
continually
by
her
side
now
,
yet
it
would
have
be
hard
to
tell
from
mere
look
and
manner
that
their
relation
to
each
other
have
at
all
change
since
their
first
conversation
.
<EOS>
still
there
be
other
ground
that
make
most
person
conclude
them
to
be
,
if
not
engage
already
,
on
the
eve
of
be
so
.
<EOS>
and
she
believe
this
herself
.
<EOS>
as
they
be
all
return
toward
Green
Arbor
in
divergent
group
,
not
think
at
all
of
take
aim
but
merely
chatter
,
word
pass
which
seem
really
the
beginning
of
that
end
 
the
beginning
of
her
acceptance
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
say
,
"
do
you
know
how
long
it
be
since
I
first
see
you
in
this
dress
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
archery
meeting
be
on
the
25th
,
and
this
be
the
13th
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
laughingly
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
good
at
calculate
,
but
I
will
venture
to
say
that
it
must
be
nearly
three
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
a
little
pause
,
and
then
he
say
,
"
that
be
a
great
loss
of
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
your
know
me
have
cause
you
?
<EOS>
pray
do
not
be
uncomplimentary
;
I
do
not
like
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Pause
again
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
because
of
the
gain
that
I
feel
the
loss
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
Gwendolen
herself
let
a
pause
.
<EOS>
She
be
think
,
"
He
be
really
very
ingenious
.
<EOS>
He
never
speak
stupidly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
silence
be
so
unusual
that
it
seem
the
strong
of
favorable
answer
,
and
he
continue
:
  
<EOS>
"
the
gain
of
know
you
make
me
feel
the
time
I
lose
in
uncertainty
.
<EOS>
do
_
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
_
like
uncertainty
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
do
,
rather
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
suddenly
beam
on
him
with
a
playful
smile
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
more
in
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
meet
her
laugh
eye
with
a
slow
,
steady
look
right
into
them
,
which
seem
like
vision
in
the
abstract
,
and
then
say
,
"
do
you
mean
more
torment
for
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
so
strange
to
Gwendolen
in
this
moment
that
she
be
quite
shake
out
of
her
usual
self
-
consciousness
.
<EOS>
blush
and
turn
away
her
eye
,
she
say
,
"
no
,
that
would
make
me
sorry
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
would
have
follow
up
this
answer
,
which
the
change
in
her
manner
make
apparently
decisive
of
her
favorable
intention
;
but
he
be
not
in
any
way
overcome
so
as
to
be
unaware
that
they
be
now
,
within
sight
of
everybody
,
descend
the
space
into
Green
Arbor
,
and
descend
it
at
an
ill
-
choose
point
where
it
begin
to
be
inconveniently
steep
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
reason
for
offer
his
hand
in
the
literal
sense
to
help
her
;
she
take
it
,
and
they
come
down
in
silence
,
much
observe
by
those
already
on
the
level
 
among
other
by
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
who
happen
to
be
stand
with
Mrs.
Davilow
.
<EOS>
that
lady
have
now
make
up
her
mind
that
Grandcourt
's
merit
be
not
such
as
would
have
induce
Catherine
to
accept
him
,
Catherine
have
so
high
a
standard
as
to
have
refuse
Lord
Slogan
.
<EOS>
hence
she
look
at
the
tenant
of
Diplow
with
dispassionate
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Grandcourt
be
not
equal
as
a
man
to
his
uncle
,
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
 
too
languid
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
Mr.
Grandcourt
be
a
much
young
man
,
but
I
should
not
wonder
if
Sir
Hugo
be
to
outlive
him
,
notwithstanding
the
difference
of
year
.
<EOS>
It
be
ill
calculate
on
succession
,
"
conclude
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
rather
too
loudly
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
indeed
,
"
say
Mrs.
Davilow
,
able
to
assent
with
quiet
cheerfulness
,
for
she
be
so
well
satisfied
with
the
actual
situation
of
affair
that
her
habitual
melancholy
in
their
general
unsatisfactoriness
be
altogether
in
abeyance
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
concerned
to
tell
of
the
food
that
be
eat
in
that
green
refectory
,
or
even
to
dwell
on
the
story
of
the
forest
scenery
that
spread
themselves
out
beyond
the
level
front
of
the
hollow
;
be
just
now
bind
to
tell
a
story
of
life
at
a
stage
when
the
blissful
beauty
of
earth
and
sky
enter
only
by
narrow
and
oblique
inlet
into
the
consciousness
,
which
be
busy
with
a
small
social
drama
almost
as
little
penetrate
by
a
feeling
of
wide
relation
as
if
it
have
be
a
puppet
-
show
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
understand
that
the
food
and
champagne
be
of
the
good
 
the
talk
and
laughter
too
,
in
the
sense
of
belong
to
the
good
society
,
where
no
one
make
an
invidious
display
of
anything
in
particular
,
and
the
advantage
of
the
world
be
take
with
that
high
-
breed
depreciation
which
follow
from
be
accustomed
to
them
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
gentleman
stroll
a
little
and
indulge
in
a
cigar
,
there
be
a
sufficient
interval
before
,
four
o'clock
 
<EOS>
the
time
for
begin
to
rove
again
.
<EOS>
among
these
,
strange
to
say
,
be
Grandcourt
;
but
not
Mr.
Lush
,
who
seem
to
be
take
his
pleasure
quite
generously
to
-
day
by
make
himself
particularly
serviceable
,
order
everything
for
everybody
,
and
by
this
activity
become
more
than
ever
a
blot
on
the
scene
to
Gwendolen
,
though
he
keep
himself
amiably
aloof
from
her
,
and
never
even
look
at
her
obviously
.
<EOS>
when
there
be
a
general
move
to
prepare
for
start
,
it
appear
that
the
bow
have
all
be
put
under
the
charge
of
Lord
Brackenshaw
's
valet
,
and
Mr.
Lush
be
concern
to
save
lady
the
trouble
of
fetch
theirs
from
the
carriage
where
they
be
prop
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
intend
to
bring
Gwendolen
's
,
but
she
,
fearful
lest
he
should
do
so
,
hurried
to
fetch
it
herself
.
<EOS>
the
valet
,
see
her
approach
,
meet
her
with
it
,
and
in
give
it
into
her
hand
give
also
a
letter
address
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
ask
no
question
about
it
,
perceive
at
a
glance
that
the
address
be
in
a
lady
's
handwriting
(
of
the
delicate
kind
which
use
to
be
esteem
feminine
before
the
present
uncial
period
)
,
and
move
away
with
her
bow
in
her
hand
,
see
Mr.
Lush
come
to
fetch
other
bow
.
<EOS>
to
avoid
meet
him
she
turn
aside
and
walk
with
her
back
toward
the
stand
of
carriage
,
open
the
letter
.
<EOS>
It
contain
these
word
        
<EOS>
if
Miss
Harleth
be
in
doubt
whether
she
should
accept
Mr.
Grandcourt
,
    
let
her
break
from
her
party
after
they
have
pass
the
Whispering
    
Stones
and
return
to
that
spot
.
<EOS>
She
will
then
hear
something
to
decide
    
her
;
but
she
can
only
hear
it
by
keep
this
letter
a
strict
secret
    
from
every
one
.
<EOS>
if
she
do
not
act
accord
to
this
letter
,
she
will
    
repent
,
as
the
woman
who
write
it
have
repent
.
<EOS>
the
secrecy
Miss
    
Harleth
will
feel
herself
bind
in
honor
to
guard
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
feel
an
inward
shock
,
but
her
immediate
thought
be
,
"
It
be
come
in
time
.
<EOS>
"
It
lie
in
her
youthfulness
that
she
be
absorb
by
the
idea
of
the
revelation
to
be
make
,
and
have
not
even
a
momentary
suspicion
of
contrivance
that
could
justify
her
in
show
the
letter
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
gather
itself
up
at
once
into
the
resolution
,
that
she
would
manage
to
go
unobserved
to
the
Whispering
Stones
;
and
thrust
the
letter
into
her
pocket
she
turn
back
to
rejoin
the
company
,
with
that
sense
of
have
something
to
conceal
which
to
her
nature
have
a
bracing
quality
and
help
her
to
be
mistress
of
herself
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
surprise
to
every
one
that
Grandcourt
be
not
,
like
the
other
smoker
,
on
the
spot
in
time
to
set
out
rove
with
the
rest
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
alight
on
him
by
-
and
-
by
,
"
say
Lord
Brackenshaw
;
"
he
can
not
be
go
far
.
<EOS>
"
at
any
rate
,
no
man
could
be
wait
for
.
<EOS>
this
apparent
forgetfulness
may
be
take
for
the
distraction
of
a
lover
so
absorb
in
thinking
of
the
beloved
object
as
to
forget
an
appointment
which
would
bring
him
into
her
actual
presence
.
<EOS>
and
the
good
-
natured
Earl
give
Gwendolen
a
distant
jocose
hint
to
that
effect
,
which
she
take
with
suitable
quietude
.
<EOS>
but
the
thought
in
her
mind
be
"
Can
he
too
be
start
away
from
a
decision
?
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
exactly
a
pleasant
thought
to
her
;
but
it
be
near
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
start
away
,
"
however
,
be
not
the
right
expression
for
the
languor
of
intention
that
come
over
Grandcourt
,
like
a
fit
of
diseased
numbness
,
when
an
end
seem
within
easy
reach
:
to
desist
then
,
when
all
expectation
be
to
the
contrary
,
become
another
gratification
of
mere
will
,
sublimely
independent
of
definite
motive
.
<EOS>
at
that
moment
he
have
begin
a
second
large
cigar
in
a
vague
,
hazy
obstinacy
which
,
if
Lush
or
any
other
mortal
who
may
be
insult
with
impunity
have
interrupt
by
overtake
him
with
a
request
for
his
return
,
would
have
express
itself
by
a
slow
removal
of
his
cigar
,
to
say
in
an
undertone
,
"
You
will
be
kind
enough
to
go
to
the
devil
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
but
he
be
not
interrupt
,
and
the
rover
set
off
without
any
visible
depression
of
spirit
,
leave
behind
only
a
few
of
the
less
vigorous
lady
,
include
Mrs.
Davilow
,
who
prefer
a
quiet
stroll
free
from
obligation
to
keep
up
with
other
.
<EOS>
the
enjoyment
of
the
day
be
soon
at
its
high
pitch
,
the
archery
get
more
spirited
and
the
change
scene
of
the
forest
from
roofed
grove
to
open
glade
grow
lovely
with
the
lengthen
shadow
,
and
the
deeply
-
feel
but
undefinable
gradation
of
the
mellowing
afternoon
.
<EOS>
It
be
agree
that
they
be
play
an
extemporize
"
as
you
like
it
;
"
and
when
a
pretty
compliment
have
be
turn
to
Gwendolen
about
her
have
the
part
of
Rosalind
,
she
feel
the
more
compel
to
be
surpass
in
loveliness
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
very
difficult
to
her
,
for
the
effect
of
what
have
happen
to
-
day
be
an
excitement
which
need
a
vent
 
a
sense
of
adventure
rather
than
alarm
,
and
a
straining
toward
the
management
of
her
retreat
,
so
as
not
to
be
impede
.
  
<EOS>
the
roving
have
be
last
nearly
an
hour
before
the
arrival
at
the
Whispering
Stones
,
two
tall
conical
block
that
lean
toward
each
other
like
gigantic
gray
-
mantle
figure
.
<EOS>
They
be
soon
survey
and
pass
by
with
the
remark
that
they
would
be
good
ghost
on
a
starlit
night
.
<EOS>
but
a
soft
sunlight
be
on
them
now
,
and
Gwendolen
feel
daring
.
<EOS>
the
stone
be
near
a
fine
grove
of
beech
,
where
the
archer
find
plenty
of
mark
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
far
be
we
from
Green
Arbor
now
?
"
say
Gwendolen
,
have
get
in
front
by
the
side
of
the
warden
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
not
more
than
half
a
mile
,
take
along
the
avenue
we
be
go
to
cross
up
there
:
<EOS>
but
I
shall
take
round
a
Couple
of
mile
,
by
the
High
Cross
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
fall
back
among
the
rest
,
when
suddenly
they
seem
all
to
be
hurry
obliquely
forward
under
the
guidance
of
Mr.
Lush
,
and
linger
a
little
where
she
be
,
she
perceive
her
opportunity
of
slip
away
.
<EOS>
soon
she
be
out
of
sight
,
and
without
run
she
seem
to
herself
to
fly
along
the
ground
and
count
the
moment
nothing
till
she
find
herself
back
again
at
the
Whispering
Stones
.
<EOS>
They
turn
their
blank
gray
side
to
her
:
what
be
there
on
the
other
side
?
<EOS>
if
there
be
nothing
after
all
?
<EOS>
that
be
her
only
dread
now
 
to
have
to
turn
back
again
in
mystification
;
and
walk
round
the
right
-
hand
stone
without
pause
,
she
find
herself
in
front
of
some
one
whose
large
dark
eye
meet
her
at
a
foot
's
distance
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
expectation
,
she
be
startle
and
shrink
bank
,
but
in
do
so
she
could
take
in
the
whole
figure
of
this
stranger
and
perceive
that
she
be
unmistakably
a
lady
,
and
one
who
must
have
be
exceedingly
handsome
.
<EOS>
She
perceive
,
also
,
that
a
few
yard
from
her
be
two

on
the
grass

She
look
at
the

Gwendolen

She

be
utter
with
a
biting
accent

with
a
determined
abstinence

anything
violent
in
tone

manner

<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
watch
Mrs.
Glasher
's
face
while
she
speak
,
feel
a
sort
of
terror
:
it
be
as
if
some
ghastly
vision
have
come
to
her
in
a
dream
and
say
,
"
I
be
a

life

<EOS>
"
have
you
anything
more
to

"
<EOS>
she
ask
in
a
low
tone
,
but
still
proud
and
coldly

the
revulsion

everyone
seem
hateful

"
then
I
will
go

say
Gwendolen
,
move
away
with
a
ceremonious
inclination
,
which
be
return
with
equal
grace
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
Gwendolen
be
in
the
beech
grove
again
but
her
party
have
go
out
of
sight
and
apparently
have
not
send
in
search
of
her
,
for
all
be
solitude
till
she
have
reach
the
avenue
point
out
by
the
warden
.
<EOS>
She
determine
to
take
this
way
back
to
Green
Arbor
,
which
she
reach
quickly
;
rapid
movement
seem
to
her
just
now
a
means
of
suspend
the
thought
which
may
prevent
her
from
behave
with
due
calm
.
<EOS>
She
have
already
make
up
her
mind
<EOS>
what
step
she
would
take
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
be
of
course
astonish
to
see
Gwendolen
return
alone
,
and
be
not
without
some
uneasiness
which
the
presence
of
other
lady
hinder
her
from
show
.
<EOS>
in
answer
to
her
word
of
surprise
Gwendolen
<EOS>
say
    
"
oh
,
I
have
be
rather
silly
.
<EOS>
I
linger
behind
to
look
at
the
Whispering
Stones
,
and
the
rest
hurry
on
after
something
,
<EOS>
so
I
lose
sight
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
best
to
come
home
by
the
short
way
 
the
avenue
that
the
warden
have
tell
me
of
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
sorry
after
all

I
have
have
enough
walking

<EOS>
"
Your
party
do
not
meet
Mr.

I
presume

Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
not
without
intention

<EOS>
"
no

"
say
Gwendolen
,
with
a
little
flash
of
defiance
,
and
a
light
laugh

we
do
not
see
any
carving
on
the
tree

either
.
<EOS>
where
can
he
be

<EOS>
I
should
think
he
have
fall
into
the
pool
or
have
an
apoplectic
fit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
all
Gwendolen
's
resolve
not
to
betray
any
agitation
,
she
could
not
help
it
that
her
tone
be
unusually
high
and

and
her
mother
feel
sure
that
something
unpropitious
have
happen
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
think
that
the
self
-
confident
young
lady
be
much
pique
,
and
that
Mr.
Grandcourt
be
probably
see
reason
to
change
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
have
no
objection

I

Gwendolen

<EOS>
"
We
think
at
first
you

alight
on
Grandcourt
and
he
have
take
you
home
.
<EOS>
Lush
say
so
.
<EOS>
but
after
that
we
meet
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
do
not
suppose
you
could
be
in
any
danger

<EOS>
the

he
have
tell
you
a
near
way
back

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
go

"
say
Grandcourt
,
come
up
with
his
usual
air
,
as
if
he
do
not
conceive
that
there
have
be
any
omission
on
his

<EOS>
Lord
Brackenshaw
give
place
to
him

move
away

<EOS>
"
yes
,
we
be
go

say
Gwendolen
,
look
busily
at
her
scarf

which
she

arrange
across
her
shoulder
Scotch

<EOS>
"
May
I
call

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
yes

if
you
like

"
say
Gwendolen
,
sweep
him
from
a
distance
with
her
eyelash
.
<EOS>
Her
voice
be
light
and
sharp
as
the
first
touch
of
frost
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
accept
his
arm
to
lead
her
to
the
carriage
;
but
while
that
be
happen
,
Gwendolen
with
incredible
swiftness
have
get
in
advance
of
them
,
and
have
spring
into
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
get
in

mamma

because
I
wish
to
be
on
this
side

"
she
say
,
apologetically
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
avoid
Grandcourt
's
touch
:
he
only
lift
his
hat
and
walk
away
 
with
the
not
unsatisfactory
impression
that
she
mean
to
show
herself
offend
by
his
neglect
.
  
<EOS>
the
mother
and
daughter
drive
for
five
minute
in

then
Gwendolen

<EOS>
what
can
be
your

so

<EOS>

My
reason
for
say
it

be
that
I

why

It

I

miserable

now

if

the

reduce
to
tremble

She
begin
to
see
that
the
difficulty
would
be

Gwendolen
go
away

and
she
do
go

<EOS>
the
packing

carefully

that
evening

not

after

the
next

bad

<EOS>
Gwendolen
have
certainly
harden
in
the
last
twenty

four
hour
:
her
mother
's
trouble
evidently
count
for
little
in
her

differ

<EOS>
It
be
to

Mrs.

SIR
THOMAS
BROWNE
.
   
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
we
have
see
,
pass
her
time
abroad
in
the
new
excitement
of
gambling
,
and
in
imagine
herself
an
empress
of
luck
,
have
bring
from
her
late
experience
a
vague
impression
that
in
this
confused
world
it
signify
nothing
what
any
one
do
,
so
that
they
amuse
themselves
.
<EOS>
We
have
see
,
too
,
that
certain
person
,
mysteriously
symbolized
as
Grapnell
&
Co.
,
have
also
think
of
reign
in
the
realm
of
luck
,
and
be
also
bent
on
amuse
themselves
,
no
matter
how
,
have
bring
about
a
painful
change
in
her
family
circumstance
;
whence
she
have
return
home
 
carry
with
her
,
against
her
inclination
,
a
necklace
which
she
have
pawn
and
some
one
else
have
redeem
.
  
<EOS>
while
she
be
go
back
to
England
,
Grandcourt
be
come
to
find
her
;
come
,
that
is
,
after
his
own
manner
 
not
in
haste
by
express
straight
from
Diplow
to
Leubronn
,
where
she
be
understand
to
be
;
but
so
entirely
without
hurry
that
he
be
induce
by
the
presence
of
some
russian
acquaintance
to
linger
at
Baden
-
Baden
and
make
various
appointment
with
them
,
which
,
however
,
his
desire
to
be
at
Leubronn
ultimately
cause
him
to
break
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
's
passion
be
of
the
intermittent
,
flicker
kind
:
never
flame
out
strongly
.
<EOS>
but
a
great
deal
of
life
go
on
without
strong
passion
:
myriad
of
cravat
be
carefully
tie
,
dinner
attend
,
<EOS>
even
speech
make
propose
the
health
of
august
personage
without
the
zest
arise
from
a
strong
desire
.
<EOS>
and
a
man
may
make
a
good
appearance
in
high
social
position
 
may
be
suppose
to
know
the
classic
,
to
have
his
reserve
on
science
,
a
strong
though
repressed
opinion
on
politic
,
and
all
the
sentiment
of
the
English
gentleman
,
at
a
small
expense
of
vital
energy
.
<EOS>
also
,
he
may
be
obstinate
or
persistent
at
the
same
low
rate
,
and
may
even
show
sudden
impulse
which
have
a
false
air
of
daemonic
strength
because
they
seem
inexplicable
,
though
perhaps
their
secret
lie
merely
in
the
want
of
regulated
channel
for
the
soul
to
move
in
 
good
and
sufficient
duct
of
habit
without
which
our
nature
easily
turn
to
mere
ooze
and
mud
,
and
at
any
pressure
yield
nothing
but
a
spurt
or
a
puddle
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
have
not
be
altogether
displease
by
Gwendolen
's
run
away
from
the
splendid
chance
he
be
hold
out
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
act
have
some
piquancy
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
like
to
think
that
it
be
due
to
resentment
of
his
careless
behavior
in
Cardell
Chase
,
which
,
when
he
come
to
consider
it
,
do
appear
rather
cool
.
<EOS>
to
have
bring
her
so
near
a
tender
admission
,
and
then
to
have
walk
headlong
away
from
further
opportunity
of
win
the
consent
which
he
have
make
her
understand
him
to
be
ask
for
,
be
enough
to
provoke
a
girl
of
spirit
;
and
to
be
worth
<EOS>
his
master
<EOS>
it
be
proper
that
she
should
have
some
spirit
.
<EOS>
doubtless
she
mean
him
to
follow
her
,
and
it
be
what
he
mean
too
.
<EOS>
but
for
a
whole
week
he
take
no
measure
toward
start
,
and
do
not
even
inquire
where
Miss
Harleth
be
go
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Lush
feel
a
triumph
that
be
mingle
with
much
distrust
;
for
Grandcourt
have
say
no
word
to
him
about
her
,
and
look
as
neutral
as
an
alligator
;
there
be
no
tell
what
may
turn
up
in
the
slowly

churn
chance
of
his
mind

<EOS>
still
,
to
have
put
off
a
decision
be
to
have
make
room
for
the
waste
of
Grandcourt
's
energy
.
  
<EOS>
the
guest
at
Diplow
feel
more
curiosity
than
their
host

<EOS>
how
be
it
that
nothing
more
be
hear
of
Miss
Harleth
?
<EOS>
be
it
credible
that
she
have
refuse
Mr.

<EOS>
Lady

a

well
endow

feel
a
sudden
interest
in
make
a
round
of
call
with
Mrs.
Torrington
,
include
the
rectory
,
Offendene
,
and
Quetcham
,
and
thus
not
only
get
twice
over
,
but
also
discuss
with
the
Arrowpoints
,
the
information
that
Miss
Harleth
be
go
to
Leubronn
,
with
some
old
friend
,
the
Baron
and
Baroness
von
Langen
;
for
the
immediate
agitation
and
disappointment
of
Mrs.
Davilow
and
the
Gascoignes
have
resolve
itself
into
a
wish
that
Gwendolen
's
disappearance
should
not
be
interpret
as
anything
eccentric
or
needful
to
be
keep
secret
.
<EOS>
the
rector
's
mind
,
indeed
,
entertain
the
possibility
that
the
marriage
be
only
a
little
defer
,
for
Mrs.
Davilow
have
not
dare
to
tell
him
of
the
bitter
determination
with
which
Gwendolen
have
speak
.
<EOS>
and
in
spite
of
his
practical
ability
,
some
of
his
experience
have
petrify
into
maxim
and
quotation
.
<EOS>
amarylli
flee
desire
that
her
hiding
-
place
should
be
know
;
and
that
love
will
find
out
the
way
"
over
the
mountain
and
over
the
wave
"
may
be
say
without
hyperbole
in
this
age
of
steam
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
he
conceive
,
be
an
Amaryllis
of
excellent
sense
but
coquettish
daring
;
the
question
be
whether
she
have
dare
too
much
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Flora
,
come
back
charge
with
news
about
Miss
Harleth
,
see
no
good
reason
why
she
should
not
try
whether
she
could
electrify
Mr.
Grandcourt
by
mention
it
to
him
at
the
table
;
and
in
do
so
shoot
a
few
hint
of
a
notion
have
get
abroad
that
he
be
a
disappointed
adorer
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
hear
with
quietude
,
but
with
attention
;
and
the
next
day
he
order
Lush
to
bring
about
a
decent
reason
for
break
up
the
party
at
Diplow
by
the
end
of
another
week
,
as
he
mean
to
go
yacht
to
the
Baltic
or
somewhere
 
it
be
impossible
to
stay
at
Diplow
as
if
he
be
a
prisoner
on
parole
,
with
a
set
of
people
whom
he
have
never
want
.
<EOS>
Lush
need
no
clear
announcement
that
Grandcourt
be
go
to
Leubronn
;
but
he
may
go
after
the
manner
of
a
creep
billiard
-
ball
and
stick
on
the
way
.
<EOS>
what
Mr.
Lush
intend
be
to
make
himself
indispensable
so
that
he
may
go
too
,
and
he
succeed
;
Gwendolen
's
repulsion
for
him
be
a
fact
that
only
amuse
his
patron
,
and
make
him
none
the
less
willing
to
have
Lush
always
at
hand
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
how
it
happen
that
Grandcourt
arrive
at
the
_
Czarina
_
on
the
fifth
day
after
Gwendolen
have
leave
Leubronn
,
and
find
there
his
uncle
,
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
,
with
his
family
,
include
Deronda
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
necessarily
a
pleasure
either
to
the
reign
power
or
the
heir
<EOS>
presumptive
when
their
separate
affair
 
a
 
touch
of
gout
,
say
,
in
the
one
,
and
a
touch
of
willfulness
in
the
other
 
happen
to
bring
them
to
the
same
spot
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
be
an
easy
-
tempered
man
,
tolerant
both
of
difference
and
defect
;
but
a
point
of
view
different
from
his
own
concern
the
settlement
of
the
family
estate
fret
him
rather
more
than
if
it
have
concern
Church
discipline
or
the
ballot
,
and
fault
be
the
less
venial
for
belong
to
a
person
whose
existence
be
inconvenient
to
him
.
<EOS>
in
no
case
could
Grandcourt
have
be
a
nephew
after
his
own
heart
;
but
as
the
presumptive
heir
to
the
mallinger
estate
he
be
the
sign
and
embodiment
of
a
chief
grievance
in
the
baronet
's
life
 
the
want
of
a
son
to
inherit
the
land
,
in
no
portion
of
which
have
he
himself
more
than
a
life
-
interest
.
<EOS>
for
in
the
ill
-
advise
settlement
which
his
father
,
Sir
Francis
,
have
choose
to
make
by
will
,
even
diplow
with
its
modicum
of
land
have
be
leave
under
the
same
condition
as
the
ancient
and
wide
inheritance
of
the
two
topping
 
Diplow
,
where
Sir
Hugo
have
live
and
hunt
through
many
a
season
in
his
young
year
,
and
where
his
wife
and
daughter
ought
to
have
be
able
to
retire
after
his
death
.
  
<EOS>
this
grievance
have
naturally
gather
emphasis
as
the
year
advance
,
and
Lady
Mallinger
,
after
have
have
three
daughter
in
quick
succession
,
have
remain
for
eight
year
till
now
that
she
be
over
forty
without
produce
so
much
as
another
girl
;
while
Sir
Hugo
,
almost
twenty
year
old
,
be
at
a
time
of
life
when
,
notwithstanding
the
fashionable
retardation
of
most
thing
from
dinner
to
marriage
,
a
man
's
hopefulness
be
apt
to
show
sign
of
wear
,
until
restore
by
second
childhood
.
  
<EOS>
in
fact
,
he
have
begin
to
despair
of
a
son
,
and
this
confirmation
of
Grandcourt
's
interest
in
the
estate
certainly
tend
to
make
his
image
and
presence
the
more
unwelcome
;
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
it
carry
circumstance
which
dispose
Sir
Hugo
to
take
care
that
the
relation
between
them
should
be
keep
as
friendly
as
possible
.
<EOS>
It
lead
him
to
dwell
on
a
plan
which
have
grow
up
side
by
side
with
his
disappointment
of
an
heir
;
namely
,
to
try
and
secure
Diplow
as
a
future
residence
for
Lady
Mallinger
and
her
daughter
,
and
keep
this
pretty
bit
of
the
family
inheritance
for
his
own
offspring
in
spite
of
that
disappointment
.
<EOS>
such
knowledge
as
he
have
of
his
nephew
's
disposition
and
affair
encourage
the
belief
that
Grandcourt
may
consent
to
a
transaction
by
which
he
would
get
a
good
sum
of
ready
money
,
as
an
equivalent
for
his
prospective
interest
in
the
domain
of
Diplow
and
the
moderate
amount
of
land
attach
to
it
.
<EOS>
if
,
after
all
,
the
unhoped
-
for
son
should
be
bear
,
the
money
would
have
be
throw
away
,
and
Grandcourt
would
have
be
pay
for
give
up
interest
that
have
turn
out
good
for
nothing
;
but
Sir
Hugo
set
down
this
risk
as
_
nil
_
,
and
of
late
year
he
have
husband
his
fortune
so
well
by
the
working
of
mine
and
the
sale
of
lease
that
he
be
prepare
for
an
outlay
.
  
<EOS>
here
be
an
object
that
make
him
careful
to
avoid
any
quarrel
with
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
some
year
before
,
when
he
be
make
improvement
at
the
Abbey
,
and
need
Grandcourt
's
concurrence
in
his
fell
an
obstructive
mass
of
timber
on
the
demesne
,
he
have
congratulate
himself
on
find
that
there
be
no
active
spite
against
him
in
his
nephew
's
peculiar
mind
;
and
nothing
have
since
occur
to
make
them
hate
each
other
more
than
be
compatible
with
perfect
politeness
,
or
with
any
accommodation
that
could
be
strictly
mutual
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
,
on
his
side
,
think
his
uncle
a
superfluity
and
a
bore
,
and
feel
that
the
list
of
thing
in
general
would
be
improve
whenever
Sir
Hugo
come
to
be
expunge
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
be
make
aware
through
Lush
,
always
a
useful
medium
,
of
the
baronet
's
inclination
concern
Diplow
,
and
he
be
gratify
to
have
the
alternative
of
the
money
in
his
mind
:
even
if
he
have
not
think
it
in
the
least
likely
that
he
would
choose
to
accept
it
,
his
sense
of
power
would
have
be
flatter
by
his
be
able
to
refuse
what
Sir
Hugo
desire
.
<EOS>
the
hint
transaction
have
tell
for
something
among
the
motive
which
have
make
him
ask
for
a
year
's
tenancy
of
Diplow
,
which
it
have
rather
annoy
Sir
Hugo
to
grant
,
because
the
excellent
hunting
in
the
neighborhood
may
decide
Grandcourt
not
to
part
with
his
chance
of
future
possession
;
 
a
man
who
have
two
place
,
in
one
of
which
the
hunting
be
less
good
,
naturally
desire
a
third
where
it
be
well
.
<EOS>
also
,
Lush
have
throw
out
to
Sir
Hugo
the
probability
that
Grandcourt
would
woo
and
win
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
and
in
that
case
ready
money
may
be
less
of
a
temptation
to
him
.
<EOS>
hence
,
on
this
unexpected
meeting
at
Leubronn
,
the
baronet
feel
much
curiosity
to
know
how
thing
have
be
go
on
at
Diplow
,
be
bent
on
be
as
civil
as
possible
to
his
nephew
,
and
look
forward
to
some
private
chat
with
Lush
.
  
<EOS>
between
Deronda
and
Grandcourt
there
be
a
more
faintly
-
mark
but
peculiar
relation
,
depend
on
circumstance
which
have
yet
to
be
make
known
.
<EOS>
but
on
no
side
be
there
any
sign
of
suppress
chagrin
on
the
first
meeting
at
the
_
table
d'hôte
_
,
an
hour
after
Grandcourt
's
arrival
;
and
when
the
quartette
of
gentleman
afterward
meet
on
the
terrace
,
without
Lady
Mallinger
,
they
move
off
together
to
saunter
through
the
room
,
Sir
Hugo
say
as
they
enter
the
large
_
saal
_
    
<EOS>
"
do
you
play
much
at
Baden
,
Grandcourt
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
look
on
and
bet
a
little
with
some
Russians
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
luck
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
I
win
,
lush
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
bring
away
about
two
hundred
,
"
say
Lush
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
here
for
the
sake
of
the
play
,
then
?
"
say
Sir
Hugo
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
do
not
care
about
play
now
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
confound
strain
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
whose
diamond
ring
and
demeanor
,
as
he
move
along
play
slightly
with
his
whisker
,
be
be
a
good
deal
stare
at
by
rouged
foreigner
interested
in
a
new
milord
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
fact
be
,
somebody
should
invent
a
mill
to
do
amusement
for
you
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
"
as
the
tartar
get
their
praying
do
.
<EOS>
but
I
agree
with
you
;
I
never
care
for
play
.
<EOS>
It
be
monotonous
 
knit
the
brain
up
into
mesh
.
<EOS>
and
it
knock
me
up
to
watch
it
now
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
one
get
poison
with
the
bad
air
.
<EOS>
I
never
stay
here
more
than
ten
minute
.
<EOS>
but
where
be
your
gambling
beauty
,
Deronda
?
<EOS>
have
you
see
her
lately
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
go
,
"
say
Deronda
,
curtly
.
  
<EOS>
"
an
uncommonly
fine
girl
,
a
perfect
Diana
,
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
turn
to
Grandcourt
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
really
worth
a
little
straining
to
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
I
see
her
winning
,
and
she
take
it
as
coolly
as
if
she
have
know
it
all
beforehand
.
<EOS>
the
same
day
Deronda
happen
to
see
her
lose
like
wildfire
,
and
she
bear
it
with
immense
pluck
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
be
clean
out
,
or
be
wise
enough
to
stop
in
time
.
<EOS>
how
do
you
know
she
be
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
by
the
Visitor
-
list
,
"
say
Deronda
,
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
shrug
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Vandernoodt
tell
me
her
name
be
Harleth
,
and
she
be
with
the
Baron
and
Baroness
von
Langen
.
<EOS>
I
see
by
the
list
that
Miss
Harleth
be
no
longer
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
hold
no
further
information
for
Lush
than
that
Gwendolen
have
be
gamble
.
<EOS>
He
have
already
look
at
the
list
,
and
ascertain
that
Gwendolen
have
go
,
but
he
have
no
intention
of
thrust
this
knowledge
on
Grandcourt
before
he
ask
for
it
;
and
he
have
not
ask
,
find
it
enough
to
believe
that
the
object
of
search
would
turn
up
somewhere
or
other
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
Grandcourt
have
hear
what
be
rather
piquant
,
and
<EOS>
not
a
word
about
Miss
Harleth
have
be
miss
by
him
.
<EOS>
after
a
moment
's
pause
he
say
to
Deronda
    
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
those
people
 
the
Langens
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
talk
with
them
a
little
since
Miss
Harleth
go
away
.
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
of
them
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
she
go
 
<EOS>
do
you
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
go
home
,
"
say
Deronda
,
coldly
,
as
if
he
wish
to
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
from
a
fresh
impulse
,
he
turn
to
look
markedly
at
Grandcourt
,
and
add
,
"
<EOS>
but
it
be
possible
you
know
her
.
<EOS>
Her
home
be
not
far
from
Diplow
:
Offendene
,
near
Winchester
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
,
turn
to
look
straight
at
Grandcourt
,
who
be
on
his
left
hand
,
may
have
be
a
subject
for
those
old
painter
who
like
contrast
of
temperament
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
calm
intensity
of
life
and
richness
of
tint
in
his
face
that
on
a
sudden
gaze
from
him
be
rather
startling
,
and
often
make
him
seem
to
have
speak
,
so
that
servant
and
official
ask
him
automatically
,
"
what
do
you
say
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
when
he
have
be
quite
silent
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
himself
feel
an
irritation
,
which
he
do
not
show
except
by
a
slight
movement
of
the
eyelid
,
at
Deronda
's
turning
round
on
him
when
he
be
not
ask
to
do
more
than
speak
.
<EOS>
but
he
answer
,
with
his
usual
drawl
,
"
yes
,
I
know
her
,
"
and
pause
with
his
shoulder
toward
Deronda
,
to
look
at
the
gambling
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
of
her
,
eh
?
"
ask
Sir
Hugo
of
Lush
,
as
the
three
move
on
a
little
way
.
<EOS>
"
She
must
be
a
new
-
comer
at
Offendene
.
<EOS>
Old
Blenny
live
there
after
the
dowager
die
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
a
little
too
much
of
her
,
"
say
Lush
,
in
a
low
,
significant
tone
;
not
sorry
to
let
Sir
Hugo
know
the
state
of
affair
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
?
how
?
"
say
the
baronet
.
<EOS>
They
all
move
out
of
the
_
salon
_
into
an
airy
promenade
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
be
on
the
brink
of
marry
her
,
"
Lush
go
on
.
"
<EOS>
but
I
hope
it
be
off
now
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
niece
of
the
clergyman
 
<EOS>
Gascoigne
 
at
Pennicote
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
be
a
widow
with
a
brood
of
daughter
.
<EOS>
this
girl
will
have
nothing
,
and
be
as
dangerous
as
gunpowder
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
foolish
marriage
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
take
a
freak
against
him
,
for
she
run
off
here
without
notice
,
when
he
have
agree
to
call
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
he
be
here
after
her
;
but
he
be
in
no
great
hurry
,
and
between
his
caprice
and
her
they
be
likely
enough
not
to
get
together
again
.
<EOS>
but
of
course
he
have
lose
his
chance
with
the
heiress
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
join
them
say
,
"
what
a
beastly
den
this
be
!
 
<EOS>
a
bad
hole
than
Baden
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
back
to
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
Sir
Hugo
and
Deronda
be
alone
,
the
baronet
begin
    
"
<EOS>
rather
a
pretty
story
.
<EOS>
that
girl
have
something
in
her
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
worth
run
after
 
have
_
de
l'imprévu
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
I
think
her
appearance
on
the
scene
have
better
my
chance
of
get
Diplow
,
whether
the
marriage
come
off
or
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
hope
a
marriage
like
that
would
not
come
off
,
"
say
Deronda
,
in
a
tone
of
disgust
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
be
you
a
little
touch
with
the
sublime
lash
?
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
put
up
his
glass
to
help
his
short
sight
in
look
at
his
companion
.
<EOS>
"
be
you
inclined
to
run
after
her
?
"
  
"
on
the
contrary
,
"
say
Deronda
,
"
I
should
rather
be
incline
to
run
away
from
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
would
easily
cut
out
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
a
girl
with
her
spirit
would
think
you
the
fine
match
of
the
two
,
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
who
often
try
Deronda
's
patience
by
find
a
joke
in
impossible
advice
.
<EOS>
(
a
difference
of
taste
in
joke
be
a
great
strain
on
the
affection
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
pedigree
and
land
belong
to
a
fine
match
,
"
say
Deronda
,
coldly
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
good
horse
will
win
in
spite
of
pedigree
,
my
boy
.
<EOS>
You
remember
Napoleon
's
_
mot
 
<EOS>
Je
suis
un
ancêtre
<EOS>
_
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
who
habitually
undervalue
birth
,
as
man
after
dining
well
often
agree
that
the
good
of
life
be
distribute
with
wonderful
equality
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
sure
that
I
want
to
be
an
ancestor
,
"
say
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
It
do
not
seem
to
me
the
rare
sort
of
origination
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
run
after
the
pretty
gambler
,
then
?
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
put
down
his
glass
.
  
<EOS>
"
decidedly
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
answer
be
perfectly
truthful
;
nevertheless
it
have
pass
through
Deronda
's
mind
that
under
other
circumstance
he
should
have
give
way
to
the
interest
this
girl
have
raise
in
him
,
and
try
to
know
more
of
her
.
<EOS>
but
his
history
have
give
him
a
strong
bias
in
another
direction
.
<EOS>
He
feel
himself
in
no
sense
free
.
        
<EOS>
Men
,
like
planet
,
have
both
a
visible
and
an
invisible
history
.
<EOS>
the
    
astronomer
thread
the
darkness
with
strict
deduction
,
account
so
    
for
every
visible
arc
in
the
wanderer
's
orbit
;
and
the
narrator
of
    
human
action
,
if
he
do
his
work
with
the
same
completeness
,
would
    
have
to
thread
the
hidden
pathway
of
feeling
and
think
which
lead
    
up
to
every
moment
of
action
,
and
to
those
moment
of
intense
    
suffer
which
take
the
quality
of
action
 
like
the
cry
of
    
Prometheus
,
whose
chain
anguish
seem
a
great
energy
than
the
sea
    
and
sky
he
invoke
and
the
deity
he
defy
.
   
<EOS>
Deronda
's
circumstance
,
indeed
,
have
be
exceptional
.
<EOS>
one
moment
have
be
burn
into
his
life
as
its
chief
epoch
 
a
moment
full
of
July
sunshine
and
large
pink
rose
shed
their
last
petal
on
a
grassy
court
enclose
on
three
side
by
a
gothic
cloister
.
<EOS>
imagine
him
in
such
a
scene
:
a
boy
of
thirteen
,
stretch
prone
on
the
grass
where
it
be
in
shadow
,
his
curly
head
prop
on
his
arm
over
a
book
,
while
his
tutor
,
also
read
,
sit
on
a
camp
-
stool
under
shelter
.
<EOS>
Deronda
's
book
be
Sismondi
's
"
history
of
the
Italian
Republics
"
;
 
the
lad
have
a
passion
for
history
,
eager
to
know
how
time
have
be
fill
up
since
the
flood
,
and
how
thing
be
carry
on
in
the
dull
period
.
<EOS>
suddenly
he
let
down
his
left
arm
and
look
at
his
tutor
,
say
in
pure
boyish
tone
    
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Fraser
,
how
be
it
that
the
pope
and
cardinal
always
have
so
many
nephews
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
tutor
,
an
able
young
Scotchman
,
who
act
as
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
's
secretary
,
rouse
rather
unwillingly
from
his
political
economy
,
answer
with
the
clear
-
cut
emphatic
chant
which
make
a
truth
doubly
tell
in
Scotch
utterance
    
<EOS>
"
Their
own
child
be
call
nephews
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
?
"
say
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
just
for
the
propriety
of
the
thing
;
because
,
as
you
know
very
well
,
priest
do
not
marry
,
and
the
child
be
illegitimate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Fraser
,
thrust
out
his
low
lip
and
make
his
chant
of
the
last
word
the
more
emphatic
for
a
little
impatience
at
be
interrupt
,
have
already
turn
his
eye
on
his
book
again
,
while
Deronda
,
as
if
something
have
sting
him
,
start
up
in
a
sit
attitude
with
his
back
to
the
tutor
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
always
call
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
his
uncle
,
and
when
it
once
occur
to
him
to
ask
about
his
father
and
mother
,
the
baronet
have
answer
,
"
You
lose
your
father
and
mother
when
you
be
quite
a
little
one
;
that
be
why
I
take
care
of
you
.
"
<EOS>
Daniel
then
strain
to
discern
something
in
that
early
twilight
,
have
a
dim
sense
of
have
be
kiss
very
much
,
and
surround
by
thin
,
cloudy
,
scented
drapery
,
till
his
finger
catch
in
something
hard
,
which
hurt
him
,
and
he
begin
to
cry
.
<EOS>
every
other
memory
he
have
be
of
the
little
world
in
which
he
still
live
.
<EOS>
and
at
that
time
he
do
not
mind
about
learn
more
,
for
he
be
too
fond
of
Sir
Hugo
to
be
sorry
for
the
loss
of
unknown
parent
.
<EOS>
life
be
very
delightful
to
the
lad
,
with
an
uncle
who
be
always
indulgent
and
cheerful
 
a
fine
man
in
the
bright
noon
of
life
,
whom
Daniel
think
absolutely
perfect
,
and
whose
place
be
one
of
the
fine
in
England
,
at
once
historical
;
romantic
,
and
home
-
like
:
a
picturesque
architectural
outgrowth
from
an
abbey
,
which
have
still
remnant
of
the
old
monastic
trunk
.
<EOS>
Diplow
lie
in
another
county
,
and
be
a
comparatively
landless
place
which
have
come
into
the
family
from
a
rich
lawyer
on
the
female
side
who
wear
the
perruque
of
the
restoration
;
whereas
the
Mallingers
have
the
grant
of
Monk
's
top
under
Henry
the
Eighth
,
and
age
before
have
hold
the
neighboring
land
of
King
's
topping
,
trace
indeed
their
origin
to
a
certain
Hugues
le
Malingre
,
who
come
in
with
the
Conqueror
 
and
also
apparently
with
a
sickly
complexion
which
have
be
happily
correct
in
his
descendant
.
<EOS>
two
row
of
these
descendant
,
direct
and
collateral
,
female
of
the
male
line
,
and
male
of
the
female
,
look
down
in
the
gallery
over
the
cloister
on
the
nephew
Daniel
as
he
walk
there
:
man
in
armor
with
pointed
beard
and
arched
eyebrow
,
pinched
lady
in
hoop
and
ruff
with
no
face
to
speak
of
;
grave
-
look
man
in
black
velvet
and
stuff
hip
,
and
fair
,
frightened
woman
hold
little
boy
by
the
hand
;
smile
politician
in
magnificent
perruque
,
and
lady
of
the
prize
-
animal
kind
,
with
rosebud
mouth
and
full
eyelid
,
accord
to
Lely
;
then
a
generation
whose
face
be
revise
and
embellish
in
the
taste
of
Kneller
;
and
so
on
through
refined
edition
of
the
family
type
in
the
time
of
Reynolds
and
Romney
,
till
the
line
end
with
Sir
Hugo
and
his
young
brother
Henleigh
.
<EOS>
this
last
have
marry
Miss
Grandcourt
,
and
take
her
name
along
with
her
estate
,
thus
make
a
junction
between
two
equally
old
family
,
impale
the
three
saracen
'
head
proper
and
three
bezant
of
the
one
with
the
tower
and
falcon
_
argent
_
of
the
other
,
and
,
as
it
happen
,
unite
their
high
advantage
in
the
prospect
of
that
Henleigh
Mallinger
Grandcourt
who
be
at
present
more
of
an
acquaintance
to
us
than
either
Sir
Hugo
or
his
nephew
Daniel
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
in
Sir
Hugo
's
youthful
portrait
with
roll
collar
and
high
cravat
,
Sir
Thomas
Lawrence
have
do
justice
to
the
agreeable
alacrity
of
expression
and
sanguine
temperament
still
to
be
see
in
the
original
,
but
have
do
something
more
than
justice
in
slightly
lengthen
the
nose
,
which
be
in
reality
short
than
may
have
be
expect
in
a
Mallinger
.
<EOS>
happily
the
appropriate
nose
of
the
family
reappear
in
his
young
brother
,
and
be
to
be
see
in
all
its
refined
regularity
in
his
nephew
Mallinger
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
but
in
the
nephew
Daniel
Deronda
the
family
face
of
various
type
,
see
on
the
wall
of
the
gallery
;
find
no
reflex
.
<EOS>
still
he
be
handsome
than
any
of
them
,
and
when
he
be
thirteen
may
have
serve
as
model
for
any
painter
who
want
to
image
the
most
memorable
of
boy
<EOS>
:
you
could
hardly
have
see
his
face
thoroughly
meet
yours
without
believe
that
human
creature
have
do
nobly
in
time
past
,
and
may
do
more
nobly
in
time
to
come
.
<EOS>
the
fine
childlike
face
have
this
consecrate
power
,
and
make
us
shudder
anew
at
all
the
grossness
and
basely
-
work
griefs
of
the
world
,
lest
they
should
enter
here
and
defile
.
  
<EOS>
but
at
this
moment
on
the
grass
among
the
rise
-
petal
,
Daniel
Deronda
be
make
a
first
acquaintance
with
those
griefs
.
<EOS>
a
new
idea
have
enter
his
mind
,
and
be
begin
to
change
the
aspect
of
his
habitual
feeling
as
happy
<EOS>
careless
voyager
be
change
with
the
sky
suddenly
threaten
and
the
thought
of
danger
arise
.
<EOS>
He
sit
perfectly
still
with
his
back
to
the
tutor
,
while
his
face
express
rapid
inward
transition
.
<EOS>
the
deep
blush
,
which
have
come
when
he
first
start
up
,
gradually
subside
;
but
his
feature
keep
that
indescribable
look
of
subdued
activity
which
often
accompany
a
new
mental
survey
of
familiar
fact
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
live
with
other
boy
,
and
his
mind
show
the
same
blending
of
child
's
ignorance
with
surprising
knowledge
which
be
oftener
see
in
bright
girl
.
<EOS>
have
read
Shakespeare
as
well
as
a
great
deal
of
history
,
he
could
have
talk
with
the
wisdom
of
a
bookish
child
about
man
who
be
bear
out
of
wedlock
and
be
hold
unfortunate
in
consequence
,
be
under
disadvantage
which
require
them
to
be
a
sort
of
hero
if
they
be
to
work
themselves
up
to
an
equal
standing
with
their
legally
bear
brother
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
never
bring
such
knowledge
into
any
association
with
his
own
lot
,
which
have
be
too
easy
for
him
ever
to
think
about
it
 
until
this
moment
when
there
have
dart
into
his
mind
with
the
magic
of
quick
comparison
,
the
possibility
that
here
be
the
secret
of
his
own
birth
,
and
that
the
man
whom
he
call
uncle
be
really
his
father
.
<EOS>
some
child
,
even
young
than
Daniel
,
have
know
the
first
arrival
of
care
,
like
an
ominous
irremovable
guest
in
their
tender
life
,
on
the
discovery
that
their
parent
,
whom
they
have
imagine
able
to
buy
everything
,
be
poor
and
in
hard
money
trouble
.
<EOS>
Daniel
feel
the
presence
of
a
new
guest
who
seem
to
come
with
an
enigmatic
veiled
face
,
and
to
carry
dimly
-
conjecture
,
dreaded
revelation
.
<EOS>
the
ardor
which
he
have
give
to
the
imaginary
world
in
his
book
suddenly
rush
toward
his
own
history
and
spend
its
pictorial
energy
there
,
explain
what
he
know
,
represent
the
unknown
.
<EOS>
the
uncle
whom
he
love
very
dearly
take
the
aspect
of
a
father
who
hold
secret
about
him
 
who
have
do
him
a
wrong
 
<EOS>
yes
,
a
wrong
:
<EOS>
and
what
have
become
of
his
mother
,
for
whom
he
must
have
be
take
away
?
 
<EOS>
secret
about
which
he
,
Daniel
,
could
never
inquire
;
for
to
speak
or
to
be
speak
to
about
these
new
thought
seem
like
fall
flake
of
fire
to
his
imagination
.
<EOS>
those
who
have
know
an
impassioned
childhood
will
understand
this
dread
of
utterance
about
any
shame
connect
with
their
parent
.
<EOS>
the
impetuous
advent
of
new
image
take
possession
of
him
with
the
force
of
fact
for
the
first
time
tell
,
and
leave
him
no
immediate
power
for
the
reflection
that
he
may
be
tremble
at
a
fiction
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
the
terrible
sense
of
collision
between
a
strong
rush
of
feeling
and
the
dread
of
its
betrayal
,
find
relief
at
length
in
big
slow
tear
,
which
fall
without
restraint
until
the
voice
of
Mr.
Fraser
be
hear
say
:
  
"
Daniel
,
do
you
see
that
you
be
sit
on
the
bent
page
of
your
book
?
"
  
<EOS>
Daniel
immediately
move
the
book
without
turn
round
,
and
after
hold
it
before
him
for
an
instant
,
rise
with
it
and
walk
away
into
the
open
ground
,
where
he
could
dry
his
tear
unobserved
.
<EOS>
the
first
shock
of
suggestion
past
,
he
could
remember
that
he
have
no
certainty
how
thing
really
have
be
,
and
that
he
have
be
make
conjecture
about
his
own
history
,
as
he
have
often
make
story
about
Pericles
or
Columbus
,
just
to
fill
up
the
blank
before
they
become
famous
.
<EOS>
only
there
come
back
certain
fact
which
have
an
obstinate
reality
,
 
almost
like
the
fragment
of
a
bridge
,
tell
you
unmistakably
how
the
arch
lie
.
<EOS>
and
again
there
come
a
mood
in
which
his
conjecture
seem
like
a
doubt
of
religion
,
to
be
banish
as
an
offense
,
and
a
mean
prying
after
what
he
be
not
mean
to
know
;
for
there
be
hardly
a
delicacy
of
feeling
this
lad
be
not
capable
of
.
<EOS>
but
the
summing
-
up
of
all
his
fluctuating
experience
at
this
epoch
be
,
that
a
secret
impression
have
come
to
him
which
have
give
him
something
like
a
new
sense
in
relation
to
all
the
element
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
and
the
idea
that
other
probably
know
thing
concern
which
they
do
not
choose
to
mention
,
set
up
in
him
a
premature
reserve
which
help
to
intensify
his
inward
experience
.
<EOS>
His
ear
open
now
to
word
which
before
that
July
day
would
have
pass
by
him
unnoted
;
and
round
every
trivial
incident
which
imagination
could
connect
with
his
suspicion
,
a
newly
-
roused
set
of
feeling
be
ready
to
cluster
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
one
such
incident
a
month
later
work
itself
deeply
into
his
life
.
<EOS>
Daniel
have
not
only
one
of
those
thrilling
boy
voice
which
seem
to
bring
an
idyllic
heaven
and
earth
before
our
eye
,
but
a
fine
musical
instinct
,
and
have
early
make
out
accompaniment
for
himself
on
the
piano
,
while
he
sing
from
memory
.
<EOS>
since
then
he
have
have
some
teaching
,
and
Sir
Hugo
,
who
delight
in
the
boy
,
use
to
ask
for
his
music
in
the
presence
of
guest
.
<EOS>
one
morning
after
he
have
be
singe
"
Sweet
Echo
"
before
a
small
party
of
gentleman
whom
the
rain
have
keep
in
the
house
,
the
baronet
,
pass
from
a
smile
remark
to
his
next
neighbor
say
:
  
"
<EOS>
come
here
,
Dan
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
boy
come
forward
with
unusual
reluctance
.
<EOS>
He
wear
an
embroidered
holland
blouse
which
set
off
the
rich
coloring
of
his
head
and
throat
,
and
the
resistant
gravity
about
his
mouth
and
eye
as
he
be
be
smile
upon
,
make
their
beauty
the
more
impressive
.
<EOS>
every
one
be
admire
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
say
to
be
a
great
singer
?
<EOS>
Should
you
like
to
be
adore
by
the
world
and
take
the
house
by
storm
;
like
Mario
and
Tamberlik
?
"
  
<EOS>
Daniel
redden
instantaneously
,
but
there
be
a
just
perceptible
interval
before
he
answer
with
angry
decision
    
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
should
hate
it
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
well
!
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
with
surprised
kindliness
intend
to
be
soothing
.
<EOS>
but
Daniel
turn
away
quickly
,
leave
the
room
,
and
go
to
his
own
chamber
throw
himself
on
the
broad
window
-
sill
,
which
be
a
favorite
retreat
of
his
when
he
have
nothing
particular
to
do
.
<EOS>
here
he
could
see
the
rain
gradually
subside
with
gleam
through
the
part
cloud
which
light
up
a
great
reach
of
the
park
,
where
the
old
oak
stand
apart
from
each
other
,
and
the
border
wood
be
pierce
with
a
green
glade
which
meet
the
eastern
sky
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
scene
which
have
always
be
part
of
his
home
 
part
of
the
dignified
ease
which
have
be
a
matter
of
course
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
and
his
ardent
cling
nature
have
appropriate
it
all
with
affection
.
<EOS>
He
know
a
great
deal
of
what
it
be
to
be
a
gentleman
by
inheritance
,
and
without
think
much
about
himself
 
<EOS>
for
he
be
a
boy
of
active
perception
and
easily
forget
his
own
existence
in
that
of
Robert
Bruce
 
<EOS>
he
have
never
suppose
that
he
could
be
shut
out
from
such
a
lot
,
or
have
a
very
different
part
in
the
world
from
that
of
the
uncle
who
pet
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
possible
(
though
not
greatly
believe
in
at
present
)
to
be
fond
of
poverty
and
take
it
for
a
bride
,
to
prefer
scour
deal
,
red
quarry
and
whitewash
for
one
's
private
surrounding
,
to
delight
in
no
splendor
but
what
have
open
door
for
the
whole
nation
,
and
to
glory
in
have
no
privilege
except
such
as
nature
insist
on
;
and
nobleman
have
be
know
to
run
away
from
elaborate
ease
and
the
option
of
idleness
,
that
they
may
bind
themselves
for
small
pay
to
hard
-
handed
labor
.
<EOS>
but
Daniel
's
taste
be
altogether
in
keep
with
his
nurture
:
his
disposition
be
one
in
which
everyday
scene
and
habit
beget
not
<EOS>
_
ennui
_
or
rebellion
,
but
delight
,
affection
,
aptitude
;
and
now
the
lad
have
be
sting
to
the
quick
by
the
idea
that
his
uncle
 
perhaps
his
father
 
thought
of
a
career
for
him
which
be
totally
unlike
his
own
,
and
which
he
know
very
well
be
not
think
of
among
possible
destination
for
the
son
of
english
gentleman
.
<EOS>
He
have
often
stay
in
London
with
Sir
Hugo
,
who
to
indulge
the
boy
's
ear
have
carry
him
to
the
opera
to
hear
the
great
tenor
,
so
that
the
image
of
a
singer
take
the
house
by
storm
be
very
vivid
to
him
;
but
now
,
spite
of
his
musical
gift
,
he
set
himself
bitterly
against
the
notion
of
be
dress
up
to
sing
before
all
those
fine
people
,
who
would
not
care
about
him
except
as
a
wonderful
toy
.
<EOS>
that
Sir
Hugo
should
have
think
of
him
in
that
position
for
a
moment
,
seem
to
Daniel
an
unmistakable
proof
that
there
be
something
about
his
birth
which
throw
him
out
from
the
class
of
gentleman
to
which
the
baronet
belong
.
<EOS>
Would
it
ever
be
mention
to
him
?
<EOS>
Would
the
time
come
when
his
uncle
would
tell
him
everything
?
<EOS>
He
shrink
from
the
prospect
:
in
his
imagination
he
prefer
ignorance
.
<EOS>
if
his
father
have
be
wicked
 
Daniel
inwardly
use
strong
word
,
for
he
be
feel
the
injury
<EOS>
do
him
as
a
maim
boy
feel
the
crushed
limb
which
for
other
be
merely
reckon
in
an
average
of
accident
 
if
his
father
have
do
any
wrong
<EOS>
,
he
wish
it
may
never
be
speak
of
to
him
:
it
be
already
a
cutting
thought
that
such
knowledge
may
be
in
other
mind
.
<EOS>
be
it
in
Mr.
Fraser
's
?
<EOS>
probably
not
,
else
he
would
not
have
speak
in
that
way
about
the
pope
's
nephews
.
<EOS>
Daniel
fancy
,
as
old
people
do
,
that
every
one
else
's
consciousness
be
as
active
as
his
own
on
a
matter
which
be
vital
to
him
.
<EOS>
do
Turvey
the
valet
know
?
 
and
old
Mrs.
French
the
housekeeper
?
 
<EOS>
and
Banks
the
bailiff
,
with
whom
he
have
ride
about
the
farm
on
his
pony
?
 
<EOS>
and
now
there
come
back
the
recollection
of
a
day
some
year
before
when
he
be
drink
Mrs.
Banks
's
whey
,
and
bank
say
to
his
wife
with
a
wink
and
a
cunning
laugh
,
"
He
feature
the
mother
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
at
that
time
little
Daniel
have
merely
think
that
bank
make
a
silly
face
,
as
the
common
farming
man
often
do
,
laugh
at
what
be
not
laughable
;
and
he
rather
resent
be
wink
at
and
talk
of
as
if
he
do
not
understand
everything
.
<EOS>
but
now
that
small
incident
become
information
:
it
be
to
be
reason
on
.
<EOS>
how
could
he
be
like
his
mother
and
not
like
his
father
?
<EOS>
His
mother
must
have
be
a
Mallinger
,
if
Sir
Hugo
be
his
uncle
.
<EOS>
but
no
!
<EOS>
His
father
may
have
be
Sir
Hugo
's
brother
and
have
change
his
name
,
as
Mr.
Henleigh
Mallinger
do
when
he
marry
Miss
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
why
have
he
never
hear
Sir
Hugo
speak
of
his
brother
Deronda
,
as
he
speak
of
his
brother
Grandcourt
?
<EOS>
Daniel
have
never
before
care
about
the
family
tree
 
only
about
that
ancestor
who
have
kill
three
saracen
in
one
encounter
.
<EOS>
but
now
his
mind
turn
to
a
cabinet
of
estate
-
map
in
the
library
,
where
he
have
once
see
an
illuminate
parchment
hang
out
,
that
Sir
Hugo
say
be
the
family
tree
.
<EOS>
the
phrase
be
new
and
odd
to
him
 
<EOS>
he
be
a
little
fellow
then
 
hardly
more
than
half
his
present
age
 
<EOS>
and
he
give
it
no
precise
meaning
.
<EOS>
He
know
more
now
and
wish
that
he
could
examine
that
parchment
.
<EOS>
He
imagine
that
the
cabinet
be
always
lock
,
and
long
to
try
it
.
<EOS>
but
here
he
check
himself
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
see
:
and
he
would
never
bring
himself
near
even
a
silent
admission
of
the
sore
that
have
open
in
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
such
experience
of
a
boy
or
girlhood
,
while
elder
be
debate
whether
most
education
lie
in
science
or
literature
,
that
the
main
line
of
character
be
often
lay
down
.
<EOS>
if
Daniel
have
be
of
a
less
ardently
affectionate
nature
,
the
reserve
about
himself
and
the
supposition
that
other
have
something
to
his
disadvantage
in
their
mind
,
may
have
turn
into
a
hard
,
proud
antagonism
.
<EOS>
but
inborn
lovingness
be
strong
enough
to
keep
itself
level
with
resentment
.
<EOS>
there
be
hardly
any
creature
in
his
habitual
world
that
he
be
not
fond
of
;
tease
them
occasionally
,
of
course
 
all
except
his
uncle
,
or
"
nunc
,
"
as
Sir
Hugo
have
teach
him
to
say
;
for
the
baronet
be
the
reverse
of
a
strait
-
laced
man
,
and
leave
his
dignity
to
take
care
of
itself
.
<EOS>
Him
Daniel
love
in
that
deep
-
root
filial
way
which
make
child
always
the
happy
for
be
in
the
same
room
with
father
or
mother
,
though
their
occupation
may
be
quite
apart
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
's
watch
-
chain
and
seal
,
his
handwriting
,
his
mode
of
smoking
and
of
talk
to
his
dog
and
horse
,
have
all
a
rightness
and
charm
about
them
to
the
boy
which
go
along
with
the
happiness
of
morning
and
breakfast
time
.
<EOS>
that
Sir
Hugo
have
always
be
a
Whig
,
make
Tories
and
Radicals
equally
opponent
of
the
true
and
good
;
and
the
book
he
have
write
be
all
see
under
the
same
consecration
of
love
belief
which
difference
what
be
his
from
what
be
not
his
,
in
spite
of
general
resemblance
.
<EOS>
those
writing
be
various
,
from
volume
of
travel
in
the
brilliant
style
,
to
article
on
thing
in
general
,
and
pamphlet
on
political
crisis
;
but
to
Daniel
they
be
alike
in
have
an
unquestionable
rightness
by
which
other
people
's
information
could
be
test
.
  
<EOS>
who
can
not
imagine
the
bitterness
of
a
first
suspicion
that
something
in
this
object
of
complete
love
be
_
not
_
quite
right
?
<EOS>
child
demand
that
their
hero
should
be
fleckless
,
and
easily
believe
them
so
:
perhaps
a
first
discovery
to
the
contrary
be
hardly
a
less
revolutionary
shock
to
a
passionate
child
than
the
threaten
downfall
of
habitual
belief
which
make
the
world
seem
to
totter
for
us
in
maturer
life
.
  
<EOS>
but
some
time
after
this
renewal
of
Daniel
's
agitation
it
appear
that
Sir
Hugo
must
have
be
make
a
merely
playful
experiment
in
his
question
about
the
singing
.
<EOS>
He
send
for
Daniel
into
the
library
,
and
look
up
from
his
writing
as
the
boy
enter
throw
himself
sideways
in
his
armchair
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
Dan
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
kindly
,
draw
one
of
the
old
embroidered
stool
close
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
come
and
sit
down
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Daniel
obey
,
and
Sir
Hugo
put
a
gentle
hand
on
his
shoulder
,
look
at
him
affectionately
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
,
my
boy
?
<EOS>
have
you
hear
anything
that
have
put
you
out
of
spirit
lately
?
"
  
<EOS>
Daniel
be
determine
not
to
let
the
tear
come
,
but
he
could
not
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
all
change
be
painful
when
people
have
be
happy
,
you
know
,
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
lift
his
hand
from
the
boy
's
shoulder
to
his
dark
curl
and
rub
them
gently
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
be
educate
exactly
as
I
wish
you
to
be
without
our
parting
.
<EOS>
and
I
think
you
will
find
a
great
deal
to
like
at
school
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
not
what
Daniel
expect
,
and
be
so
far
a
relief
,
which
give
him
spirit
to
answer
    
<EOS>
"
be
I
to
go
to
school
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
mean
you
to
go
to
Eton
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
to
have
the
education
of
an
english
gentleman
;
and
for
that
it
be
necessary
that
you
should
go
to
a
public
school
in
preparation
for
the
university
:
<EOS>
Cambridge
<EOS>
I
mean
you
to
go
to
;
it
be
my
own
university
.
"
  
<EOS>
Daniel
's
color
come
and
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
say
,
sirrah
?
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
be
a
gentleman
,
"
say
Daniel
,
with
firm
distinctness
,
"
and
go
to
school
,
if
that
be
what
a
gentleman
's
son
must
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
watch
him
silently
for
a
few
moment
,
think
he
understand
now
why
the
lad
have
seem
angry
at
the
notion
of
become
a
singer
.
<EOS>
then
he
say
tenderly
    
"
<EOS>
and
so
you
will
not
mind
about
leave
your
old
Nunc
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
shall
,
"
say
Daniel
,
clasp
Sir
Hugo
's
caressing
arm
with
both
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
shall
not
I
come
home
and
be
with
you
in
the
holiday
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
,
generally
,
"
say
Sir
Hugo
.
<EOS>
"
but
now
I
mean
you
to
go
at
once
to
a
new
tutor
,
to
break
the
change
for
you
before
you
go
to
Eton
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
this
interview
Daniel
's
spirit
rise
again
.
<EOS>
He
be
mean
to
be
a
gentleman
,
and
in
some
unaccountable
way
it
may
be
that
his
conjecture
be
all
wrong
.
<EOS>
the
very
keenness
of
the
lad
teach
him
to
find
comfort
in
his
ignorance
.
<EOS>
while
he
be
busy
his
mind
in
the
construction
of
possibility
,
it
become
plain
to
him
that
there
must
be
possibility
of
which
he
know
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
leave
off
brooding
,
young
joy
and
the
spirit
of
adventure
not
be
easily
quench
within
him
,
and
in
the
interval
before
his
go
away
<EOS>
he
sing
about
the
house
,
dance
among
the
old
servant
,
make
them
part
gift
,
and
insist
many
time
to
the
groom
on
the
care
that
be
to
be
take
of
the
black
pony
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
I
shall
know
much
less
than
the
other
boy
,
Mr.
Fraser
?
"
say
Daniel
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
bent
to
think
that
every
stranger
would
be
surprised
at
his
ignorance
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
dunce
to
be
find
everywhere
,
"
say
the
judicious
Fraser
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
be
the
big
;
but
you
have
not
the
making
of
a
Porson
in
you
,
or
a
Leibnitz
either
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
to
be
a
Porson
or
a
Leibnitz
,
"
say
Daniel
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
be
a
great
leader
,
like
Pericles
or
Washington
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
;
you
have
a
notion
they
do
with
little
parsing
,
and
less
algebra
,
"
say
Fraser
.
<EOS>
but
in
reality
he
think
his
pupil
a
remarkable
lad
,
to
whom
one
thing
be
as
easy
as
another
,
if
he
have
only
a
mind
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
thing
go
on
very
well
with
Daniel
in
his
new
world
,
except
that
a
boy
with
whom
he
be
at
once
incline
to
strike
up
a
close
friendship
talk
to
him
a
great
deal
about
his
home
and
parent
,
and
seem
to
expect
a
like
expansiveness
in
return
.
<EOS>
Daniel
immediately
shrink
into
reserve
,
and
this
experience
remain
a
check
on
his
naturally
strong
bent
toward
the
formation
of
intimate
friendship
.
<EOS>
every
one
,
his
tutor
include
,
set
him
down
as
a
reserved
boy
,
though
he
be
so
good
-
humored
and
unassume
,
as
well
as
quick
,
both
at
study
and
sport
,
that
nobody
call
his
reserve
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
certainly
his
face
have
a
great
deal
to
do
with
that
favorable
interpretation
;
but
in
this
instance
the
beauty
of
the
close
lip
tell
no
falsehood
.
  
<EOS>
a
surprise
that
come
to
him
before
his
first
vacation
strengthen
the
silent
consciousness
of
a
grief
within
,
which
may
be
compare
in
some
way
with
Byron
's
susceptibility
about
his
deformed
foot
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
write
word
that
he
be
married
to
Miss
Raymond
,
a
sweet
lady
,
whom
Daniel
must
remember
have
see
.
<EOS>
the
event
would
make
no
difference
about
his
spend
the
vacation
at
the
Abbey
;
he
would
find
Lady
Mallinger
a
new
friend
whom
he
would
be
sure
to
love
 
and
much
more
to
the
usual
effect
when
a
man
,
have
do
something
agreeable
to
himself
,
be
dispose
to
congratulate
other
on
his
own
good
fortune
,
and
the
deducible
satisfactoriness
of
event
in
general
.
  
<EOS>
let
Sir
Hugo
be
partly
excuse
until
the
ground
of
his
action
can
be
more
fully
know
.
<EOS>
the
mistake
in
his
behavior
to
Deronda
be
due
to
that
dullness
toward
what
may
be
go
on
in
other
mind
,
especially
the
mind
of
child
,
which
be
among
the
common
deficiency
,
even
in
good
-
natured
man
like
him
,
when
life
have
be
generally
easy
to
themselves
,
and
their
energy
have
be
quietly
spend
in
feel
gratified
.
<EOS>
no
one
be
better
aware
than
he
that
Daniel
be
generally
suspect
to
be
his
own
son
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
pleased
with
that
suspicion
;
and
his
imagination
have
never
once
be
trouble
with
the
way
in
which
the
boy
himself
may
be
affect
,
either
then
or
in
the
future
,
by
the
enigmatic
aspect
of
his
circumstance
.
<EOS>
He
be
as
fond
of
him
as
could
be
,
and
mean
the
good
by
him
.
<EOS>
and
,
consider
the
lightness
with
which
the
preparation
of
young
life
seem
to
lie
on
respectable
conscience
,
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
can
hardly
be
hold
open
to
exceptional
reproach
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
a
bachelor
till
he
be
five
-
and
-
forty
,
have
always
be
regard
as
a
fascinating
man
of
elegant

what
could
be
more
natural
,
even
accord
to
the
index
of
language
,
than
that
he
should
have
a
beautiful
boy
like
the
little
Deronda
to
take
care
of
?
<EOS>
the
mother
may
even
,
perhaps
,
be
in
the
great
world
 
meet
with
in
Sir
Hugo
's
residence
abroad
.
<EOS>
the
only
person
to
feel
any
objection
be
the
boy
himself
,
who
could
not
have
be
consult
.
<EOS>
and
the
boy
's
objection
have
never
be
dream
of
by
anybody
but
himself
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
time
Deronda
be
ready
to
go
to
Cambridge
,
Lady
Mallinger
have
already
three
daughter
 
charming
baby
,
all
three
,
but
whose
sex
be
announce
as
a
melancholy
alternative
,
the
offspring
desire
be
a
son
;
if
Sir
Hugo
have
no
son
the
succession
must
go
to
his
nephew
,
Mallinger
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
Daniel
no
longer
hold
a
wavering
opinion
about
his
own
birth
.
<EOS>
His
full
knowledge
have
tend
to
convince
him
that
Sir
Hugo
be
his
father
,
and
he
conceive
that
the
baronet
,
since
he
never
approach
a
communication
on
the
subject
,
wish
him
to
have
a
tacit
understanding
of
the
fact
,
and
to
accept
in
silence
what
would
be
generally
consider
more
than
the
due
love
and
nurture
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
's
marriage
may
certainly
have
be
feel
as
a
new
ground
of
resentment
by
some
youth
in
Deronda
's
position
,
and
the
timid
Lady
Mallinger
with
her
fast
-
come
little
one
may
have
be
image
to
scowl
at
,
as
likely
to
divert
much
that
be
disposable
in
the
feeling
and
possession
of
the
baronet
from
one
who
feel
his
own
claim
to
be
prior
.
<EOS>
but
hatred
of
innocent
human
obstacle
be
a
form
of
moral
stupidity
not
in
Deronda
's
grain
;
even
the
indignation
which
have
long
mingle
itself
with
his
affection
for
Sir
Hugo
take
the
quality
of
pain
rather
than
of
temper
;
and
as
his
mind
ripen
to
the
idea
of
tolerance
toward
error
,
he
habitually
like
the
idea
with
his
own
silent
grievance
.
  
<EOS>
the
sense
of
an
entailed
disadvantage
 
the
deform
foot
doubtfully
hide
by
the
shoe
,
make
a
restlessly
active
spiritual
yeast
,
and
easily
turn
a
self
-
center
,
unloving
nature
into
an
Ishmaelite
.
<EOS>
but
in
the
rarer
sort
,
who
presently
see
their
own
frustrated
claim
as
one
among
a
myriad
,
the
inexorable
sorrow
take
the
form
of
fellowship
and
make
the
imagination
tender
.
<EOS>
Deronda
's
early
-
weaken
susceptibility
,
charge
at
first
with
ready
indignation
and
resistant
pride
,
have
raise
in
him
a
premature
reflection
on
certain
question
of
life
;
it
have
give
a
bias
to
his
conscience
,
a
sympathy
with
certain
ill
,
and
a
tension
of
resolve
in
certain
direction
,
who
mark
him
off
from
other
youth
much
more
than
any
talent
he
possess

<EOS>
one
day
near
the
end
of
the
long
vacation

when
he
have
be
make
a

in

Rhineland
with
his
Eton
tutor

and
be
come
for
a
farewell
stay
at
the

before

he
say
to
Sir

"
what
do
you
intend
me
to
be
,
sir

"
They
be
in
the
library

and
it
be
the
fresh
morning
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
have
call
him
in
to
read
a
letter
from
a
Cambridge
Don
who
be
to
be
interested
in
him
;
and
since
the
baronet
wear
an
air
at
once
business
-
like
and
leisurely
,
the
moment
seem
propitious
for
enter
on
a
grave
subject
which
have
never

thoroughly
discuss

<EOS>
"
whatever
your
inclination
lead
you
to

my

<EOS>
I
think
it
right
to
give
you
the
option
of
the
army
,
but
you
shut
the
door
on
that
,
and
I
be
glad
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
expect
you
to
choose
just
yet
 
by
-
and
-
by
,
when
you
have
look
about
you
a
little
more
and
try
your
mettle
among
old
man

<EOS>
the
university
have
a
good
wide
opening
into

<EOS>
there
be
prize
to

win

a
bit
of
good
fortune
often
give
the
turn
to
a
man

taste

<EOS>
from
what
I
see
and
hear
,
I
should
think
you
can
take
up
anything
you
like
.
<EOS>
You
be
in
the
deep
water
with
your
classic
than
I
ever
get
into
,
and
if
you
be
rather
sick
of
that
swimming
,
Cambridge
be
the
place
where
you
can
go
into
mathematic
with
a
will
,
and
disport
yourself
on
the
dry
sand
as
much
as
you
like

yes

yes

I
know
 
<EOS>
you
be
not
inclined
to
that
;

you
need
not

up
anything
against

<EOS>
You
will
have
a
bachelor

enough
for

look
about
with

perhaps
I
have
better
tell
you
that

You
may
make
yourself
a

take
up
politic

I
confess
that

I
should
like
to
have
you

<EOS>
Deronda
look
embarrassed
.
<EOS>
He
feel
that
he
ought
to
make
some
sign
of
gratitude
,
but
other
feeling
clog
his
tongue
.
<EOS>
a
moment
be
pass
by
in
which
a
question
about
his
birth
be
throb
within
him
,
and
yet
it
seem
more
impossible
than
ever
that
the
question
should
find
vent
 
more
impossible
than
ever
that
he
could
hear
certain
thing
from
Sir
Hugo
's
lip
.
<EOS>
the
liberal
way
in
which
he
be
deal
with
be
the
more
striking
because
the
baronet
have
of
late
care
particularly
for
money
,
and
for
make
the
utmost
of
his
life
-
interest
in
the
estate
by
way
of
provide
for
his
daughter
;
and
as
all
this
flash
through
Daniel
's
mind
<EOS>
it
be
momentarily
within
his
imagination
that
the
provision
for
him
may
come
in
some
way
from
his
mother
.
<EOS>
but
such
vaporous
conjecture
pass
away
as
quickly
as
it
come
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
appear
not
to
notice
anything
peculiar
in
Daniel
's
manner
,
and
presently
go
on
with
his
usual
chatty
liveliness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
you
have
do
some
good
reading
outside
your
classic
,
and
have
get
a
grip
of
french
and
german
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
unless
a
man
can
get
the
prestige
and
income
of
a
Don
and
write
donnish
book
,
it
be
hardly
worth
while
for
him
to
make
a
greek
and
latin
machine
of
himself
and
be
able
to
spin
you
out
page
of
the
greek
dramatist
at
any
verse
you
will
give
him
as
a
cue
.
<EOS>
that
be
all
very
fine
,
but
in
practical
life
nobody
do
give
you
the
cue
for
page
of
Greek
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
it
be
a
nicety
of
conversation
which
I
would
have
you
attend
to
 
much
quotation
of
any
sort
,
even
in
English
be
bad
.
<EOS>
It
tend
to
choke
ordinary
remark
.
<EOS>
one
could
not
carry
on
life
comfortably
without
a
little
blindness
to
the
fact
that
everything
have
be
say
well
than
we
can
put
it
ourselves
.
<EOS>
but
talk
of
don
,
I
have
see
don
make
a
capital
figure
in
society
;
and
occasionally
he
can
shoot
you
down
a
cart
-
load
of
learn
in
the
right
place
,
which
will
tell
in
politic
.
<EOS>
such
man
be
want
;
and
if
you
have
any
turn
for
be
a
Don
,
I
say
nothing
against
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

I
think
there
be
not
much
chance
of
that
.
<EOS>
Quicksett
and
Puller
be
both
strong
than
I
be
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
not
be
much
disappoint
if
I
do
not
come
out
with
high
honor

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
you
to
do
yourself
credit
,
but
for
God
's
sake
do
not
come
out
as
a
superior
expensive
kind
of
idiot
,
like
young
Brecon
,
who
get
a
double
first
,
and
have
be
learn
to
knit
brace
ever
since
.
<EOS>
what
I
wish
you
to
get
be
a
passport
in
life
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
go
against
our
university
system
<EOS>
:
we
want
a
little
disinterested
culture
to
make
head
against
cotton
and
capital
,
especially
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
My
Greek
have
all
evaporate
;
if
I
have
to
construe
a
verse
on
a
sudden
,
I
should
get
an
apoplectic
fit
.
<EOS>
but
it
form
my
taste
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
my
English
be
the
well
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
on
this
point
Daniel
keep
a
respectful
silence
.
<EOS>
the
enthusiastic
belief
in
Sir
Hugo
's
writing
as
a
standard
,
and
in
the
Whigs
as
the
choose
race
among
politician
,
have
gradually
vanish
along
with
the
seraphic
boy
's
face
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
the
hard
of
worker
at
Eton
.
<EOS>
though
some
kind
of
study
and
reading
come
as
easily
as
boat
to
him
,
he
be
not
of
the
material
that
usually
make
the
first
-
rate
Eton
scholar
.
<EOS>
there
have
spring
up
in
him
a
meditative
yearning
after
wide
knowledge
which
be
likely
always
to
abate
ardor
in
the
fight
for
prize
acquirement
in
narrow
track
.
<EOS>
happily
he
be
modest
,
and
take
any
second
-
rateness
in
himself
simply
as
a
fact
,
not
as
a
marvel
necessarily
to
be
account
for
by
a
superiority
.
<EOS>
still
Mr.
Fraser
's
high
opinion
of
the
lad
have
not
be
altogether
belie
by
the
youth
:
Daniel
have
the
stamp
of
rarity
in
a
subdued
fervor
of
sympathy
,
an
activity
of
imagination
on
behalf
of
other
which
do
not
show
itself
effusively
,
but
be
continually
see
in
act
of
considerateness
that
strike
his
companion
as
moral
eccentricity
.
<EOS>
"
Deronda
would
have
be
first
-
rate
if
he
have
have
more
ambition
,
"
be
a
frequent
remark
about
him
.
<EOS>
but
how
could
a
fellow
push
his
way
properly
when
he
object
to
swop
for
his
own
advantage
,
knock
under
by
choice
when
he
be
within
an
inch
of
victory
,
and
,
unlike
the
great
Clive
,
would
rather
be
the
calf
than
the
butcher
?
<EOS>
It
be
a
mistake
,
however
,
to
suppose
that
Deronda
have
not
his
share
of
ambition
.
<EOS>
We
know
he
have
suffer
keenly
from
the
belief
that
there
be
a
tinge
of
dishonor
in
his
lot
;
but
there
be
some
case
,
and
his
be
one
of
them
,
in
which
the
sense
of
injury
breed
 
not
the
will
to
inflict
injury
and
climb
over
them
as
a
ladder
,
but
a
hatred
of
all
injury
.
<EOS>
He
have
his
flash
of
fierceness
and
could
hit
out
upon
occasion
,
but
the
occasion
be
not
always
what
may
have
be
expect
.
<EOS>
for
in
what
related
to
himself
his
resentful
impulse
have
be
early
check
by
a
master
affectionateness
.
<EOS>
love
have
a
habit
of
say
"
never
mind
"
to
angry
self
,
who
,
sit
down
for
the
nonce
in
the
low
place
,
by
-
and
-
by
get
use
to
it
.
<EOS>
so
it
be
that
as
Deronda
approach
manhood
his
feeling
for
Sir
Hugo
,
while
it
be
get
more
and
more
mixed
with
criticism
,
be
gain
in
that
sort
of
allowance
which
reconcile
criticism
with
tenderness
.
<EOS>
the
dear
old
beautiful
home
and
everything
within
it
,
Lady
Mallinger
and
her
little
one
include
,
be
consecrate
for
the
youth
as
they
have
be
for
the
boy
 
only
with
a
certain
difference
of
light
on
the
object
.
<EOS>
the
altarpiece
be
no
longer
miraculously
perfect
,
paint
under
infallible
guidance
,
but
the
human
hand
discern
in
the
work
be
appeal
to
a
reverent
tenderness
safe
from
the
gust
of
discovery
.
<EOS>
certainly
Deronda
's
ambition
,
even
in
his
spring
-
time
,
lie
exceptionally
aloof
from
conspicuous
,
vulgar
triumph
,
and
from
other
ugly
form
of
boyish
energy
;
perhaps
because
he
be
early
impassione
by
idea
,
and
burn
his
fire
on
those
height
.
<EOS>
one
may
spend
a
good
deal
of
energy
in
disliking
and
resist
what
other
pursue
,
and
a
boy
who
be
fond
of
somebody
else
's
pencil
-
case
may
not
be
more
energetic
than
another
who
be
fond
of
give
his
own
pencil
-
case
away
.
<EOS>
still
it
be
not
Deronda
's
disposition
to
escape
from
ugly
scene
;
he
be
more
inclined
to
sit
through
them
and
take
care
of
the
fellow
least
able
to
take
care
of
himself
.
<EOS>
It
have
help
to
make
him
popular
that
he
be
sometimes
a
little
compromised
by
this
apparent
comradeship
.
<EOS>
for
a
meditative
interest
in
learn
how
human
misery
be
work
 
as
precocious
in
him
as
<EOS>
another
sort
of
genius
in
the
poet
who
write
a
Queen
Mab
at
nineteen
 
be
so
infuse
with
kindliness
that
it
easily
pass
for
comradeship
.
<EOS>
enough
.
<EOS>
in
many
of
our
neighbor
'
life
there
be
much
not
only
of
error
and
lapse
,
but
of
a
certain
exquisite
goodness
which
can
never
be
write
or
even
speak
 
only
divine
by
each
of
us
,
accord
to
the
inward
instruction
of
our
own
privacy
.
  
<EOS>
the
impression
he
make
at
Cambridge
correspond
to
his
position
at
Eton
.
<EOS>
every
one
interested
in
him
agree
that
he
may
have
take
a
high
place
if
his
motive
have
be
of
a
more
pushing
sort
,
and
if
he
have
not
,
instead
of
regard
study
as
instrument
of
success
,
hamper
himself
with
the
notion
that
they
be
to
feed
motive
and
opinion
 
a
notion
which
set
him
criticising
method
and
argue
against
his
freight
and
harness
when
he
should
have
be
use
all
his
might
to
pull
.
<EOS>
in
the
beginning
his
work
at
the
university
have
a
new
z
for
him
:
indifferent
to
the
continuation
of
Eton
classical
drill
,
he
apply
himself
vigorously
to
mathematic
,
for
which
he
have
show
an
early
aptitude
under
Mr.
Fraser
,
and
he
have
the
delight
of
feel
his
strength
in
a
comparatively
fresh
exercise
of
thought
.
<EOS>
that
delight
,
and
the
favorable
opinion
of
his
tutor
,
determine
him
to
try
for
a
mathematical
scholarship
in
the
Easter
of
his
second
year
:
he
wish
to
gratify
Sir
Hugo
by
some
achievement
,
and
the
study
of
the
high
mathematic
,
have
the
grow
fascination
inherent
in
all
thinking
which
demand
intensity
,
be
make
him
a
more
exclusive
worker
than
he
have
be
before
.
  
<EOS>
but
here
come
the
old
check
which
have
be
grow
with
his
growth
.
<EOS>
He
find
the
inward
bent
toward
comprehension
and
thoroughness
diverge
more
and
more
from
the
track
mark
out
by
the
standard
of
examination
:
he
feel
a
heighten
discontent
with
the
wear
futility
and
enfeeble
strain
of
a
demand
for
excessive
retention
and
dexterity
without
any
insight
into
the
principle
which
form
the
vital
connection
of
knowledge
.
<EOS>
(
Deronda
's
undergraduateship
occur
fifteen
year
ago
,
when
the
perfection
of
our
university
method
be
not
yet
indisputable
.
)
<EOS>
in
hour
when
his
dissatisfaction
be
strong
upon
him
he
reproach
himself
for
have
be
attract
by
the
conventional
advantage
of
belong
to
an
english
university
,
and
be
tempt
toward
the
project
of
ask
Sir
Hugo
to
let
him
quit
Cambridge
and
pursue
a
more
independent
line
of
study
abroad
.
<EOS>
the
germ
of
this
inclination
have
be
already
stir
in
his
boyish
love
of
universal
history
,
which
make
him
want
to
be
at
home
in
foreign
country
,
and
follow
in
imagination
the
travel
student
of
the
middle
age
.
<EOS>
He
long
now
to
have
the
sort
of
apprenticeship
to
life
which
would
not
shape
him
too
definitely
,
and
rob
him
of
the
choice
that
may
come
from
a
free
growth
.
<EOS>
one
see
that
Deronda
's
demerit
be
likely
to
be
on
the
side
of
reflective
hesitation
,
and
this
tendency
be
encourage
by
his
position
;
there
be
no
need
for
him
to
get
an
immediate
income
,
or
to
fit
himself
in
haste
for
a
profession
;
and
his
sensibility
to
the
half
-
know
fact
of
his
parentage
make
him
an
excuse
for
linger
longer
than
other
in
a
state
of
social
neutrality
.
<EOS>
other
man
,
he
inwardly
say
,
have
a
more
definite
place
and
duty
.
<EOS>
but
the
project
which
flatter
his
inclination
may
not
have
go
beyond
the
stage
of
ineffective
brooding
,
if
certain
circumstance
have
not
quicken
it
into
action
.
  
<EOS>
the
circumstance
arise
out
of
an
enthusiastic
friendship
which
extend
into
his
after
-
life
.
<EOS>
of
the
same
year
with
himself
,
and
occupy
small
room
close
to
his
,
be
a
youth
who
have
come
as
an
exhibitioner
from
Christ
's
hospital
,
and
have
eccentricity
enough
for
a
Charles
Lamb
.
<EOS>
only
to
look
at
his
pinched
feature
and
blonde
hair
hang
over
his
collar
remind
one
of
pale
quaint
head
by
early
german
painter
;
and
when
this
faint
coloring
be
light
up
by
a
joke
,
there
come
sudden
crease
about
the
mouth
and
eye
which
may
have
be
mould
by
the
soul
of
an
aged
humorist
.
<EOS>
His
father
,
an
engraver
of
some
distinction
,
have
be
dead
eleven
year
,
and
his
mother
have
three
girl
to
educate
and
maintain
on
a
meagre
annuity
.
<EOS>
Hans
Meyrick
 
he
have
be
daringly
christened
after
Holbein
 
feel
himself
the
pillar
,
or
rather
the
knotted
and
twisted
trunk
,
round
which
these
feeble
climb
plant
must
cling
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
want
of
ability
or
of
honest
well
-
mean
affection
to
make
the
prop
trustworthy
:
<EOS>
the
ease
and
quickness
with
which
he
study
may
serve
him
to
win
prize
at
Cambridge
,
as
he
have
do
among
the
Blue
Coats
,
in
spite
of
irregularity
.
<EOS>
the
only
danger
be
,
that
the
incalculable
tendency
in
him
may
be
fatally
time
,
and
that
his
good
intention
may
be
frustrate
by
some
act
which
be
not
due
to
habit
but
to
capricious
,
scattered
impulse
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
say
to
have
any
one
bad
habit
;
yet
at
longer
or
short
interval
he
have
fit
of
impish
recklessness
,
and
do
thing
that
would
have
make
the
bad
habit
.
  
<EOS>
Hans
in
his
right
mind
,
however
,
be
a
lovable
creature
,
and
in
Deronda
he
have
happen
to
find
a
friend
who
be
likely
to
stand
by
him
with
the
more
constancy
,
from
compassion
for
these
brief
aberration
that
may
bring
a
long
repentance
.
<EOS>
han
,
indeed
,
share
Deronda
's
room
nearly
as
much
as
he
use
his
own
:
to
Deronda
he
pour
himself
out
on
his
study
,
his
affair
,
his
hope
;
the
poverty
of
his
home
,
and
his
love
for
the
creature
there
;
the
itching
of
his
finger
to
draw
,
and
his
determination
to
fight
it
away
for
the
sake
of
get
some
sort
of
a
plum
that
he
may
divide
with
his
mother
and
the
girl
.
<EOS>
He
want
no
confidence
in
return
,
but
seem
to
take
Deronda
as
an
Olympian
who
need
nothing
 
an
egotism
in
friendship
which
be
common
enough
with
mercurial
,
expansive
nature
.
<EOS>
Deronda
be
content
,
and
give
Meyrick
all
the
interest
he
claim
,
get
at
last
a
brotherly
anxiety
about
him
,
look
after
him
in
his
erratic
moment
,
and
contrive
by
adroitly
delicate
device
not
only
to
make
up
for
his
friend
's
lack
of
pence
,
but
to
save
him
from
threaten
chance
.
<EOS>
such
friendship
easily
become
tender
:
the
one
spread
strong
shelter
wing
that
delight
in
spread
,
the
other
get
the
warm
protection
which
be
also
a
delight
.
<EOS>
Meyrick
be
go
in
for
a
classical
scholarship
,
and
his
success
,
in
various
way
momentous
,
be
the
more
probable
from
the
steadying
influence
of
Deronda
's
friendship
.
  
<EOS>
but
an
imprudence
of
Meyrick
's
,
commit
at
the
beginning
of
the
autumn
term
,
threaten
to
disappoint
his
hope
.
<EOS>
with
his
usual
alternation
between
unnecessary
expense
and
self
-
privation
,
he
have
give
too
much
money
for
an
old
engraving
which
fascinate
him
,
and
to
make
up
for
it
,
have
come
from
London
in
a
third
-
class
carriage
with
his
eye
expose
to
a
bitter
wind
and
any
irritate
particle
the
wind
may
drive
before
it
.
<EOS>
the
consequence
be
a
severe
inflammation
of
the
eye
,
which
for
some
time
hang
over
him
the
threat
of
a
lasting
injury
.
<EOS>
this
crush
trouble
call
out
all
Deronda
's
readiness
to
devote
himself
,
and
he
make
every
other
occupation
secondary
to
that
of
be
companion
and
eye
to
Hans
,
work
with
him
and
for
him
at
his
classic
,
that
if
possible
his
chance
of
the
classical
scholarship
may
be
save
.
<EOS>
han
,
to
keep
the
knowledge
of
his
suffering
from
his
mother
and
sister
,
allege
his
work
as
a
reason
for
pass
the
Christmas
at
Cambridge
,
and
his
friend
stay
up
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
Deronda
relax
his
hold
on
his
mathematic
,
and
Hans
,
reflect
on
this
,
at
length
say
:
"
<EOS>
old
fellow
,
while
you
be
hoist
me
you
be
risk
yourself
.
<EOS>
with
your
mathematical
cram
one
may
be
like
Moses
or
Mahomet
or
somebody
of
that
sort
who
have
to
cram
,
and
forget
in
one
day
what
it
have
take
him
forty
to
learn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
would
not
admit
that
he
care
about
the
risk
,
and
he
have
really
be
beguile
into
a
little
indifference
by
double
sympathy
:
he
be
very
anxious
that
Hans
should
not
miss
the
much
-
need
scholarship
,
and
he
feel
a
revival
of
interest
in
the
old
study
.
<EOS>
still
,
when
han
,
rather
late
in
the
day
,
get
able
to
use
his
own
eye
,
Deronda
have
tenacity
enough
to
try
hard
and
recover
his
lose
ground
.
<EOS>
He
fail
,
however
;
but
he
have
the
satisfaction
of
see
Meyrick
win
.
  
<EOS>
Success
,
as
a
sort
of
beginning
that
urge
completion
,
may
have
reconcile
Deronda
to
his
university
course
;
but
the
emptiness
of
all
thing
,
from
politic
to
pastime
,
be
never
so
striking
to
us
as
when
we
fail
in
them
.
<EOS>
the
loss
of
the
personal
triumph
have
no
severity
for
him
,
but
the
sense
of
have
spend
his
time
ineffectively
in
a
mode
of
working
which
have
be
against
the
grain
,
give
him
a
distaste
for
any
renewal
of
the
process
,
which
turn
his
imagined
project
of
quit
Cambridge
into
a
serious
intention
.
<EOS>
in
speak
of
his
intention
to
Meyrick
he
make
it
appear
that
he
be
glad
of
the
turn
event
have
take
 
glad
to
have
the
balance
dip
decidedly
,
and
feel
freed
from
his
hesitation
;
but
he
observe
that
he
must
of
course
submit
to
any
strong
objection
on
the
part
of
Sir
Hugo
.
  
<EOS>
Meyrick
's
joy
and
gratitude
be
disturb
by
much
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
He
believe
in
Deronda
's
alleged
preference
,
but
he
feel
keenly
that
in
serve
him
Daniel
have
place
himself
at
a
disadvantage
in
Sir
Hugo
's
opinion
,
and
he
say
mournfully
,
"
if
you
have
get
the
scholarship
,
Sir
Hugo
would
have
think
that
you
ask
to
leave
us
with
a
well
grace
.
<EOS>
You
have
spoil
your
luck
for
my
sake
,
and
I
can
do
nothing
to
amend
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
you
can
;
you
be
to
be
a
first
-
rate
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
call
that
a
first
-
rate
investment
of
my
luck
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
confound
it
!
<EOS>
You
save
an
ugly
mongrel
from
drown
,
and
expect
him
to
cut
a
fine
figure
.
<EOS>
the
poet
have
make
tragedy
enough
about
sign
one
's
self
over
to
wickedness
for
the
sake
of
get
something
plummy
;
I
shall
write
a
tragedy
of
a
fellow
who
sign
himself
over
to
be
good
,
and
be
uncomfortable
ever
after
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
Hans
lose
no
time
in
secretly
write
the
history
of
the
affair
to
Sir
Hugo
,
make
it
plain
that
but
for
Deronda
's
generous
devotion
he
could
hardly
have
fail
to
win
the
prize
he
have
be
work
for
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
friend
go
up
to
town
together
:
Meyrick
to
rejoice
with
his
mother
and
the
girl
in
their
little
home
at
Chelsea
;
Deronda
to
carry
out
the
less
easy
task
of
open
his
mind
to
Sir
Hugo
.
<EOS>
He
rely
a
little
on
the
baronet
's
general
tolerance
of
eccentricity
,
but
he
expect
more
opposition
than
he
meet
with
.
<EOS>
He
be
receive
with
even
warm
kindness
than
usual
,
the
failure
be
pass
over
lightly
,
and
when
he
detail
his
reason
for
wish
to
quit
the
university
and
go
to
study
abroad
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
sit
for
some
time
in
a
silence
which
be
rather
meditative
than
surprised
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
say
,
look
at
Daniel
with
examination
,
"
so
you
do
not
want
to
be
an
Englishman
to
the
backbone
after
all
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
be
an
Englishman
,
but
I
want
to
understand
other
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
and
I
want
to
get
rid
of
a
merely
english
attitude
in
study
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
;
you
do
not
want
to
be
turn
out
in
the
same
mould
as
every
other
youngster
.
<EOS>
and
I
have
nothing
to
say
against
your
doffing
some
of
our
national
prejudice
.
<EOS>
I
feel
the
well
myself
for
have
spend
a
good
deal
of
my
time
abroad
.
<EOS>
but
,
for
God
's
sake
,
keep
an
English
cut
,
and
do
not
become
indifferent
to
bad
tobacco
!
<EOS>
and
,
my
dear
boy
,
it
be
good
to
be
unselfish
and
generous
;
but
do
not
carry
that
too
far
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
do
to
give
yourself
to
be
melt
down
for
the
benefit
of
the
tallow
-
trade
;
you
must
know
where
to
find
yourself
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
shall
put
no
vote
on
your
going
.
<EOS>
wait
until
I
can
get
off
Committee
,
and
I
will
run
over
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
so
Deronda
go
accord
to
his
will
.
<EOS>
but
not
before
he
have
spend
some
hour
with
Hans
Meyrick
,
and
be
introduce
to
the
mother
and
sister
in
the
Chelsea
home
.
<EOS>
the
shy
girl
watch
and
register
every
look
of
their
brother
's
friend
,
declare
by
Hans
to
have
be
the
salvation
of
him
,
a
fellow
like
nobody
else
,
and
,
in
fine
,
a
brick
.
<EOS>
They
so
thoroughly
accept
Deronda
as
an
ideal
,
that
when
he
be
go
the
young
set
to
work
,
under
the
criticism
of
the
two
eld

,
to
paint
him
as
Prince

<EOS>
"

TENNYSON
:
_
Locksley
Hall
_
.
   
<EOS>
on
a
fine
evening
near
the
end
of
July
,
Deronda
be
row
himself
on
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
It
be
already
a
year
or
more
since
he
have
come
back
to
England
,
with
the
understanding
that
his
education
be
finish
,
and
that
he
be
somehow
to
take
his
place
in
english
society
;
but
though
,
in
deference
to
Sir
Hugo
's
wish
,
and
to
fence
off
idleness
,
he
have
begin
to
read
law
,
this
apparent
decision
have
be
without
other
result
than
to
deepen
the
root
of
indecision
.
<EOS>
His
old
love
of
boating
have
revive
with
the
more
force
now
that
he
be
in
town
with
the
Mallingers
,
because
he
could
nowhere
else
get
the
same
still
seclusion
which
the
river
give
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
boat
of
his
own
at
Putney
,
and
whenever
Sir
Hugo
do
not
want
him
,
it
be
his
chief
holiday
to
row
till
past
sunset
and
come
in
again
with
the
star
.
<EOS>
not
that
he
be
in
a
sentimental
stage
;
but
he
be
in
another
sort
of
contemplative
mood
perhaps
more
common
in
the
young
man
of
our
day
 
that
of
question
whether
it
be
worth
while
to
take
part
in
the
battle
of
the
world
:
<EOS>
I
mean
,
of
course
,
the
young
man
in
whom
the
unproductive
labor
of
questioning
be
sustain
by
three
or
five
per
cent
,
on
capital
which
somebody
else
have
battle
for
.
<EOS>
It
puzzle
Sir
Hugo
that
one
who
make
a
splendid
contrast
with
all
that
be
sickly
and
puling
should
be
hamper
with
idea
which
,
since
they
leave
an
accomplished
Whig
like
himself
unobstructed
,
could
be
no
well
than
spectral
illusion
;
especially
as
Deronda
set
himself
against
authorship
 
a
vocation
which
be
understand
to
turn
foolish
thinking
into
fund
.
  
<EOS>
row
in
his
dark
-
blue
shirt
and
skull
-
cap
,
his
curl
closely
clip
,
his
mouth
beset
with
abundant
soft
wave
of
beard
,
he
bear
only
disguise
trace
of
the
seraphic
boy
"
trail
cloud
of
glory
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
still
,
even
one
who
have
never
see
him
since
his
boyhood
may
have
look
at
him
with
slow
recognition
,
due
perhaps
to
the
peculiarity
of
the
gaze
which
Gwendolen
choose
to
call
"
dreadful
,
"
though
it
have
really
a
very
mild
sort
of
scrutiny
.
<EOS>
the
voice
,
sometimes
audible
in
subdued
snatch
of
song
,
have
turn
out
merely
a
high
baritone
;
indeed
,
only
to
look
at
his
lithe
,
powerful
frame
and
the
firm
gravity
of
his
face
would
have
be
enough
for
an
experienced
guess
that
he
have
no
rare
and
ravish
tenor
such
as
nature
reluctantly
make
at
some
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
look
at
his
hand
:
they
be
not
small
and
dimple
,
with
taper
finger
that
seem
to
have
only
a
deprecate
touch
:
they
be
long
,
flexible
,
firmly
-
grasp
hand
,
such
as
Titian
have
paint
in
a
picture
where
he
want
to
show
the
combination
of
refinement
with
force
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
something
of
a
likeness
,
too
,
between
the
face
belong
to
the
hand
 
in
both
the
uniform
pale
-
brown
skin
,
the
perpendicular
brow
,
the
calmly
penetrate
eye
.
<EOS>
not
seraphic
any
longer
:
thoroughly
terrestrial
and
manly
;
but
still
of
a
kind
to
raise
belief
in
a
human
dignity
which
can
afford
to
recognize
poor
relation
.
  
<EOS>
such
type
meet
us
here
and
there
among
average
condition
;
in
a
workman
,
for
example
,
whistle
over
a
bit
of
measurement
and
lift
his
eye
to
answer
our
question
about
the
road
.
<EOS>
and
often
the
grand
meaning
of
face
as
well
as
of
write
word
may
lie
chiefly
in
the
impression
that
happen
just
now
to
be
of
importance
in
relation
to
Deronda
,
row
on
the
Thames
in
a
very
ordinary
equipment
for
a
young
Englishman
at
leisure
,
and
pass
under
Kew
Bridge
with
no
thought
of
an
adventure
in
which
his
appearance
be
likely
to
play
any
part
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
he
object
very
strongly
to
the
notion
,
which
other
have
not
allow
him
to
escape
,
that
his
appearance
be
of
a
kind
to
draw
attention
;
and
hint
of
this
,
intend
to
be
complimentary
,
find
an
angry
resonance
in
him
,
come
from
mingled
experience
,
to
which
a
clue
have
already
be
give
.
<EOS>
His
own
face
in
the
glass
have
during
many
year
associate
for
him
with
thought
of
some
one
whom
he
must
be
like
 
one
about
whose
character
and
lot
he
continually
wonder
,
and
never
dare
to
ask
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
neighborhood
of
Kew
Bridge
,
between
six
and
seven
o'clock
,
the
river
be
no
solitude
.
<EOS>
several
person
be
saunter
on
the
towing
-
path
,
and
here
and
there
a
boat
be
ply
.
<EOS>
Deronda
have
be
row
fast
to
get
over
this
spot
,
when
,
become
aware
of
a
great
barge
advance
toward
him
,
he
guide
his
boat
aside
,
and
rest
on
his
oar
within
a
couple
of
yard
of
the
river
-
brink
.
<EOS>
He
be
all
the
while
unconsciously
continue
the
low
-
toned
chant
which
have
haunt
his
throat
all
the
way
up
the
river
 
<EOS>
the
gondolier
's
song
in
the
"
Otello
,
"
where
Rossini
have
worthily
set
to
music
the
immortal
word
of
Dante
              
"
Nessun
maggior
dolore
  
<EOS>
Che
ricordarsi
del
tempo
felice
  
Nella
miseria
"
:
[
footnote
:
Dante
's
word
be
best
render
by
our
own
poet
in
the
line
at
the
head
of
the
chapter
.
]
  
<EOS>
and
,
as
he
rest
on
his
oar
,
the
pianissimo
fall
of
the
melodic
wail
"
nella
miseria
"
be
distinctly
audible
on
the
brink
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
three
or
four
person
have
pause
at
various
spot
to
watch
the
barge
pass
the
bridge
,
and
doubtless
include
in
their
notice
the
young
gentleman
in
the
boat
;
but
probably
it
be
only
to
one
ear
that
the
low
vocal
sound
come
with
more
significance
than
if
they
have
be
an
insect
-
murmur
amidst
the
sum
of
current
noise
.
<EOS>
Deronda
,
await
the
barge
,
now
turn
his
head
to
the
river
-
side
,
and
see
at
a
few
yard
'
distant
from
him
a
figure
which
may
have
be
an
impersonation
of
the
misery
he
be
unconsciously
give
voice
to
:
a
girl
hardly
more
than
eighteen
,
of
low
slim
figure
,
with
most
delicate
little
face
,
her
dark
curl
push
behind
her
ear
under
a
large
black
hat
,
a
long
woolen
cloak
over
her
shoulder
.
<EOS>
Her
hand
be
hang
down
clasped
before
her
,
and
her
eye
be
fix
on
the
river
with
a
look
of
immovable
,
statue
-
like
despair
.
<EOS>
this
strong
arrest
of
his
attention
make
him
cease
singing
:
apparently
his
voice
have
enter
her
inner
world
without
her
take
any
note
of
whence
<EOS>
it
come
,
for
when
it
suddenly
cease
she
change
her
attitude
slightly
,
and
,
look
round
with
a
frightened
glance
,
meet
Deronda
's
face
.
<EOS>
It
be
but
a
couple
of
moment
,
but
that
seem
a
long
while
for
two
people
to
look
straight
at
each
other
.
<EOS>
Her
look
be
something
like
that
of
a
fawn
or
other
gentle
animal
before
it
turn
to
run
away
:
no
blush
,
no
special
alarm
,
but
only
some
timidity
which
yet
could
not
hinder
her
from
a
long
look
before
she
turn
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
it
seem
to
Deronda
that
she
be
only
half
conscious
of
her
surrounding
:
be
she
hungry
,
or
be
there
some
other
cause
of
bewilderment
?
<EOS>
He
feel
an
outleap
of
interest
and
compassion
toward
her
;
but
the
next
instant
she
have
turn
and
walk
away
to
a
neighboring
bench
under
a
tree
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
right
to
linger
and
watch
her
:
poorly
-
dressed
,
melancholy
woman
be
common
sight
;
it
be
only
the
delicate
beauty
,
picturesque
line
and
color
of
the
image
that
be
exceptional
,
and
these
condition
make
it
more
markedly
impossible
that
he
should
obtrude
his
interest
upon
her
.
<EOS>
He
begin
to
row
away
and
be
soon
far
up
the
river
;
but
no
other
thought
be
busy
enough
quite
to
expel
that
pale
image
of
unhappy
girlhood
.
<EOS>
He
fall
again
and
again
to
speculate
on
the
probable
romance
that
lie
behind
that
loneliness
and
look
of
desolation
;
then
to
smile
at
his
own
share
in
the
prejudice
that
interesting
face
must
have
interesting
adventure
;
then
to
justify
himself
for
feel
that
sorrow
be
the
more
tragic
when
it
befall
delicate
,
childlike
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
have
forget
the
look
of
misery
if
she
have
be
ugly
and
vulgar
,
"
he
say
to
himself
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
deny
that
the
attractiveness
of
the
image
make
it
likeli
to
last
.
<EOS>
It
be
clear
to
him
as
an
onyx
cameo
;
the
brown
-
black
drapery
,
the
white
face
with
small
,
small
feature
and
dark
,
long
-
lash
eye
.
<EOS>
His
mind
glance
over
the
girl
-
tragedy
that
be
go
on
in
the
world
,
hide
,
unheeded
,
as
if
they
be
but
tragedy
of
the
copse
or
hedgerow
,
where
the
helpless
drag
wound
wing
forsakenly
,
and
streak
the
shadow
moss
with
the
red
moment
-
hand
of
their
own
death
.
<EOS>
Deronda
of
late
,
in
his
solitary
excursion
,
have
be
occupy
chiefly
with
uncertainty
about
his
own
course
;
but
those
uncertainty
,
be
much
at
their
leisure
,
be
will
not
to
have
such
wide
-
sweep
connection
with
all
life
and
history
that
the
new
image
of
helpless
sorrow
easily
blent
itself
with
what
seem
to
him
the
strong
array
of
reason
why
he
should
shrink
from
get
into
that
routine
of
the
world
which
make
man
apologize
for
all
its
wrong
-
doing
,
and
take
opinion
as
mere
professional
equipment
 
why
he
should
not
draw
strongly
at
any
thread
in
the
hopelessly
-
entangled
scheme
of
thing
.
  
<EOS>
He
use
his
oar
little
,
satisfied
to
go
with
the
tide
and
be
take
back
by
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
habit
to
indulge
himself
in
that
solemn
passivity
which
easily
come
with
the
lengthen
shadow
and
mellow
light
,
when
think
and
desire
melt
together
imperceptibly
,
and
what
in
other
hour
may
have
seem
argument
take
the
quality
of
passionate
vision
.
<EOS>
by
the
time
he
have
come
back
again
with
the
tide
past
Richmond
Bridge
<EOS>
the
sun
be
near
set
:
and
the
approach
of
his
favorite
hour
 
with
its
deepen
stillness
and
darken
masse
of
tree
and
building
between
the
double
glow
of
the
sky
and
the
river
 
dispose
him
to
linger
as
if
they
have
be
an
unfinished
strain
of
music
.
<EOS>
He
look
out
for
a
perfectly
solitary
spot
where
he
could
lodge
his
boat
against
the
bank
,
and
,
throw
himself
on
his
back
with
his
head
prop
on
the
cushion
,
could
watch
out
the
light
of
sunset
and
the
opening
of
that
bead
-
roll
which
some
oriental
poet
describe
as
God
's
call
to
the
little
star
,
who
each
answer
,
"
here
be
i.
"
<EOS>
He
choose
a
spot
in
the
bend
of
the
river
just
opposite
Kew
Gardens
,
where
he
have
a
great
breadth
of
water
before
him
reflect
the
glory
of
the
sky
,
while
he
himself
be
in
shadow
.
<EOS>
He
lie
with
his
hand
behind
his
head
,
prop
on
a
level
with
the
boat
's
edge
,
so
that
he
could
see
all
round
him
,
but
could
not
be
see
by
any
one
at
a
few
yard
'
distance
;
and
for
a
long
while
he
never
turn
his
eye
from
the
view
right
in
front
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
forget
everything
else
in
a
half
-
speculative
,
half
-
involuntary
identification
of
himself
with
the
object
he
be
look
at
,
think
how
far
it
may
be
possible
habitually
to
shift
his
centre
till
his
own
personality
would
be
no
less
outside
him
than
the
landscape
 
when
the
sense
of
something
move
on
the
bank
opposite
him
where
it
be
border
by
a
line
of
willow
bush
,
make
him
turn
his
glance
thitherward
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
moment
he
have
a
dart
presentiment
about
the
move
figure
;
and
now
he
could
see
the
small
face
with
the
strange
dying
sunlight
upon
it
.
<EOS>
He
fear
to
frighten
her
by
a
sudden
movement
,
and
watch
her
with
motionless
attention
.
<EOS>
She
look
round
,
but
seem
only
to
gather
security
from
the
apparent
solitude
,
hide
her
hat
among
the
willow
,
and
immediately
take
off
her
woolen
cloak
.
<EOS>
presently
she
seat
herself
and
deliberately
dip
the
cloak
in
the
water
,
hold
it
there
a
little
while
,
then
take
it
out
with
effort
,
rise
from
her
seat
as
she
do
so
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
Deronda
feel
sure
that
she
mean
to
wrap
the
wet
cloak
round
her
as
a
drown
shroud
;
there
be
no
long
time
to
hesitate
about
frighten
her
.
<EOS>
He
rise
and
seize
his
oar
to
ply
across
;
happily
her
position
lie
a
little
below
him
.
<EOS>
the
poor
thing
,
overcome
with
terror
at
this
sign
of
discovery
from
the
opposite
bank
,
sink
down
on
the
brink
again
,
hold
her
cloak
half
out
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
She
crouch
and
cover
her
face
as
if
she
keep
a
faint
hope
that
she
have
not
be
see
,
and
that
the
boatman
be
accidentally
come
toward
her
.
<EOS>
but
soon
he
be
within
brief
space
of
her
,
steady
his
boat
against
the
bank
,
and
speak
,
but
very
gently
    
"
do
not
be
afraid
.
<EOS>
You
be
unhappy
.
<EOS>
pray
,
trust
me
.
<EOS>
tell
me
what
I
can
do
to
help
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
raise
her
head
and
look
up
at
him
.
<EOS>
His
face
now
be
toward
the
light
,
and
she
know
it
again
.
<EOS>
but
she
do
not
speak
for
a
few
moment
which
be
a
renewal
of
their
former
gaze
at
each
other
.
<EOS>
at
last
she
say
in
a
low
sweet
voice
,
with
an
accent
so
distinct
that
it
suggest
foreignness
and
yet
be
not
foreign
,
"
I
see
you
before
,
"
and
then
add
dreamily
,
after
a
like
pause
,
"
nella
miseria
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
,
not
understand
the
connection
of
her
thought
,
suppose
that
her
mind
be
weaken
by
distress
and
hunger
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
you
,
singe
?
<EOS>
"
she
go
on
,
hesitatingly
 
"
Nessun
maggior
dolore
.
<EOS>
"
the
mere
word
themselves
utter
in
her
sweet
undertone
seem
to
give
the
melody
to
Deronda
's
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
yes
,
"
he
say
,
understand
now
,
"
I
be
often
singe
them
.
<EOS>
but
I
fear
you
will
injure
yourself
stay
here
.
<EOS>
pray
let
me
take
you
in
my
boat
to
some
place
of
safety
.
<EOS>
and
that
wet
cloak
 
let
me
take
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
would
not
attempt
to
take
it
without
her
leave
,
dread
lest
he
should
scare
her
.
<EOS>
even
at
his
word
,
he
fancy
that
she
shrink
and
clutch
the
cloak
more
tenaciously
.
<EOS>
but
her
eye
be
fix
on
him
with
a
question
in
them
as
she
say
,
"
You
look
good
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
God
's
command
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
trust
me
.
<EOS>
let
me
help
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
die
before
I
will
let
any
harm
come
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
rise
from
her
sit
posture
,
first
drag
the
saturate
cloak
and
then
let
it
fall
on
the
ground
 
<EOS>
it
be
too
heavy
for
her
tired
arm
.
<EOS>
Her
little
woman
's
figure
as
she
lay
her
delicate
chill
hand
together
one
over
the
other
against
her
waist
,
and
go
a
step
backward
while
she
lean
her
head
forward
as
if
not
to
lose
sight
of
his
face
,
be
unspeakably
touching
.
  
<EOS>
"
Great
God
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
word
escape
Deronda
in
a
tone
so
low
and
solemn
that
they
seem
like
a
prayer
become
unconsciously
vocal
.
<EOS>
the
agitate
impression
this
forsaken
girl
be
make
on
him
stir
a
fibre
that
lie
close
to
his
deep
interest
in
the
fate
of
woman
 
<EOS>
"
perhaps
my
mother
be
like
this
one
.
"
<EOS>
the
old
thought
have
come
now
with
a
new
impetus
of
mingled
feeling
,
and
urge
that
exclamation
in
which
both
East
and
West
have
for
age
concentrate
their
awe
in
the
presence
of
inexorable
calamity
.
  
<EOS>
the
low
-
toned
word
seem
to
have
some
reassurance
in
them
for
the
hearer
:
she
step
forward
close
to
the
boat
's
side
,
and
Deronda
put
out
his
hand
,
hope
now
that
she
would
let
him
help
her
in
.
<EOS>
She
have
already
put
her
tiny
hand
into
his
which
close
around
it
,
when
some
new
thought

her
,
and
draw
back
<EOS>
she
say
    
"
I
have
nowhere
to
go
 
nobody

to
me
in
all
this
land
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
you
to
a
lady
who
have
daughter
,
"
say
Deronda
,
immediately
.
<EOS>
He
feel
a
sort
of
relief
in
gather
that
the
wretched
home
and
cruel
friend
he
imagine
her
to
be
flee
from
be
not
in
the
near
background
.
<EOS>
still
she
hesitate
,
and
say
more
timidly
than
ever
    
"
do
you
belong
to
the
theatre
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
theatre
,
"
say
Deronda
,
in
a
decide
tone
.
<EOS>
then
beseechingly
,
"
I
will
put
you
in
perfect
safety
at
once
;
with
a
lady
,
a
good
woman
;
I
be
sure
she
will
be
kind
.
<EOS>
let
us
lose
no
time
:
you
will
make
yourself
ill
.
<EOS>
life
may
still
become
sweet
to
you
.
<EOS>
there
be
good
people
 
<EOS>
there
be
good
woman
who
will
take
care
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
draw
backward
no
more
,
but
step
in
easily
,
as
if
she
be
use
to
such
action
,
and
sit
down
on
the
cushion
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
covering
for
your
head
,
"
say
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
hat
?
"
<EOS>
(
She
lift
up
her
hand
to
her
head
.
)
<EOS>
"
It
be
quite
hide
in
the
bush
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
find
it
,
"
say
Deronda
,
put
out
his
hand
deprecatingly
as
she
attempt
to
rise
.
<EOS>
"
the
boat
be
fix
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
jump
out
,
find
the
hat
,
and
lift
up
the
saturate
cloak
,
wring
it
and
throw
it
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
carry
the
cloak
away
,
to
prevent
any
one
who
may
have
notice
you
from
think
you
have
be
drown
,
"
he
say
,
cheerfully
,
as
he
get
in
again
and
present
the
old
hat
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
have
any
other
garment
than
my
coat
to
offer
you
.
<EOS>
but
shall
you
mind
throw
it
over
your
shoulder
while
we
be
on
the
water
?
<EOS>
It
be
quite
an
ordinary
thing
to
do
,
when
people
return
late
and
be
not
enough
provide
with
wrap
.
"
<EOS>
He
hold
out
the
coat
toward
her
with
a
smile
,
and
there
come
a
faint
melancholy
smile
in
answer
,
as
she
take
it
and
put
it
on
very
cleverly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
some
biscuit
 
<EOS>
should
you
like
them
?
"
say
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
can
not
eat
.
<EOS>
I
have
still
some
money
leave
to
buy
bread
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
begin
to
ply
his
oar
without
further
remark
,
and
they
go
along
swiftly
for
many
minute
without
speak
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
look
at
him
,
but
be
watch
the
oar
,
lean
forward
in
an
attitude
of
repose
,
as
if
she
be
begin
to
feel
the
comfort
of
return
warmth
and
the
prospect
of
life
instead
of
death
.
<EOS>
the
twilight
be
deepen
;
the
red
flush
be
all
go
and
the
little
star
be
give
their
answer
one
after
another
.
<EOS>
the
moon
be
rise
,
but
be
still
entangle
among
the
tree
and
building
.
<EOS>
the
light
be
not
such
that
he
could
distinctly
discern
the
expression
of
her
feature
or
her
glance
,
but
they
be
distinctly
before
him
nevertheless
 
feature
and
a
glance
which
seem
to
have
give
a
full
meaning
for
him
to
the
human
face
.
<EOS>
among
his
anxiety
one
be
dominant
:
his
first
impression
about
her
,
that
her
mind
may
be
disorder
,
have
not
be
quite
dissipate
:
the
project
of
suicide
be
unmistakable
,
and
give
a
deep
color
to
every
other
suspicious
sign
.
<EOS>
He
long
to
begin
a
conversation
,
but
abstain
,
wish
to
encourage
the
confidence
that
may
induce
her
to
speak
first
.
<EOS>
at
last
she
do
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
to
listen
to
the
oar
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
so
do
i.
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
have
not
come
,
I
should
have
be
dead
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
bear
you
to
speak
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
never
be
sorry
that
I
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
see
how
I
shall
be
glad
to
live
.
<EOS>
the
_
maggior
dolore
_
and
the
_
miseria
_
have
last
longer
than
the
_
tempo
felice

.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
pause
and
then
go
on
dreamily
,
 
"
_
Dolore
 
miseria
_
 
<EOS>
I
think
those
word
be
alive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
be
mute
:
to
question
her
seem
an
unwarrantable
freedom
;
he
shrink
from
appear
to
claim
the
authority
of
a
benefactor
,
or
to
treat
her
with
the
less
reverence
because
she
be
in
distress
.
<EOS>
She
go
on
musingly
    
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
not
wicked
.
<EOS>
death
and
life
be
one
before
the
Eternal
.
<EOS>
I
know
our
father
slay
their
child
and
then
slay
themselves
,
to
keep
their
soul
pure
.
<EOS>
I
mean
it
so
.
<EOS>
but
now
I
be
command
to
live
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
see
how
I
shall
live
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
friend
.
<EOS>
I
will
find
them
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
shake
her
head
and
say
mournfully
,
"
not
my
mother
and
brother
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
find
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
english
?
<EOS>
You
must
be
 
speak
English
so
perfectly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
do
not
answer
immediately
,
but
look
at
Deronda
again
,
strain
to
see
him
in
the
double
light
.
<EOS>
until
now
she
have
be
watch
the
oar
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
she
be
half
roused
,
and
wonder
which
part
of
her
impression
be
dream
and
which
wake
.
<EOS>
sorrowful
isolation
have
benumb
her
sense
of
reality
,
and
the
power
of
distinguish
outward
and
inward
be
continually
slip
away
from
her
.
<EOS>
Her
look
be
full
of
wonder
timidity
such
as
the
forsaken
one
in
the
desert
may
have
lift
to
the
angelic
vision
before
she
know
whether
his
message
be
in
anger
or
in
pity
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
want
to
know
if
I
be
english
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
at
last
,
while
Deronda
be
redden
nervously
under
a
gaze
which
he
feel
more
fully
than
he
see
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
know
nothing
except
what
you
like
to
tell
me
,
"
he
say
,
still
uneasy
in
the
fear
that
her
mind
be
wander
.
<EOS>
"
perhaps
it
be
not
good
for
you
to
talk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
will
tell
you
.
<EOS>
I
be
English
-
bear
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
a
Jewess
.
<EOS>
"
  
Deronda
be
silent
,
inwardly
wonder
that
he
have
not
say
this
to
himself
before
,
though
any
one
who
have
see
delicate
-
faced
spanish
girl
may
simply
have
guess
her
to
be
spanish
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
despise
me
for
it
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
say
presently
in
low
tone
,
which
have
a
sadness
that
pierce
like
a
cry
from
a
small
dumb
creature
in
fear
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
I
?
"
say
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
so
foolish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
many
Jews
be
bad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
be
many
Christians
.
<EOS>
but
I
should
not
think
it
fair
for
you
to
despise
me
because
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
mother
and
brother
be
good
.
<EOS>
but
I
shall
never
find
them
.
<EOS>
I
be
come
a
long
way
 
from
abroad
.
<EOS>
I
run
away
;
but
I
can
not
tell
you
 
I
can
not
speak
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
may
find
my
mother
again
 
God
would
guide
me
.
<EOS>
but
then
I
despair
.
<EOS>
this
morning
when
the
light
come
,
I
feel
as
if
one
word
keep
sound
within
me
 
never
!
<EOS>
never
!
<EOS>
but
now
 
I
begin
 
to
think
 
"
her
word
be
break
by
rise
sobs
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
command
to
live
 
<EOS>
perhaps
we
be
go
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
an
outburst
of
weeping
she
bury
her
head
on
her
knee
.
<EOS>
He
hope
that
this
passionate
weeping
may
relieve
her
excitement
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
he
be
inwardly
picture
in
much
embarrassment
how
he
should
present
himself
with
her
in
Park
Lane
 
the
course
which
he
have
at
first
unreflectingly
determined
on
.
<EOS>
no
one
kind
and
more
gentle
than
Lady
Mallinger
;
but
it
be
hardly
probable
that
she
would
be
at
home
;
and
he
have
a
shuddering
sense
of
a
lackey
stare
at
this
delicate
,
sorrowful
image
of
womanhood
 
of
glare
light
and
fine
staircase
,
and
perhaps
chill
suspicious
manner
from
lady
's
maid
and
housekeeper
,
that
may
scare
the
mind
already
in
a
state
of
dangerous
susceptibility
.
<EOS>
but
to
take
her
to
any
other
shelter
than
a
home
already
know
to
him
be
not
to
be
contemplate
:
he
be
full
of
fear
about
the
issue
of
the
adventure
which
have
bring
on
him
a
responsibility
all
the
heavy
for
the
strong
and
agitate
impression
this
childlike
creature
have
make
on
him
.
<EOS>
but
another
resource
come
to
mind
:
he
could
venture
to
take
her
to
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
 
to
the
small
house
at
Chelsea
 
where
he
have
be
often
enough
since
his
return
from
abroad
to
feel
sure
that
he
could
appeal
there
to
generous
heart
,
which
have
a
romantic
readiness
to
believe
in
innocent
need
and
to
help
it
.
<EOS>
Hans
Meyrick
be
safe
away
in
Italy
,
and
Deronda
feel
the
comfort
of
present
himself
with
his
charge
at
a
house
where
he
would
be
meet
by
a
motherly
figure
of
quakerish
neatness
,
and
three
girl
who
hardly
know
of
any
evil
closer
to
them
than
what
lie
in
history
-
book
,
and
drama
,
and
would
at
once
associate
a
lovely
Jewess
with
Rebecca
in
"
Ivanhoe
,
"
besides
think
that
everything
they
do
at
Deronda
's
request
would
be
do
for
their
idol
,
Hans
.
<EOS>
the
vision
of
the
Chelsea
home
once
raise
,
Deronda
no
longer
hesitate
.
  
<EOS>
the
rumble
thither
in
the
cab
after
the
stillness
of
the
water
seem
long
.
<EOS>
happily
his
charge
have
be
quiet
since
her
fit
of
weeping
,
and
submit
like
a
tired
child
.
<EOS>
when
they
be
in
the
cab
,
she
lay
down
her
hat
and
try
to
rest
her
head
,
but
the
jolt
movement
would
not
let
it
rest
.
<EOS>
still
she
doze
,
and
her
sweet
head
hang
helpless
,
first
on
one
side
,
then
on
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
too
good
to
have
any
fear
about
take
her
in
,
"
think
Deronda
.
<EOS>
Her
person
,
her
voice
,
her
exquisite
utterance
,
be
one
strong
appeal
to
belief
and
tenderness
.
<EOS>
yet
what
have
be
the
history
which
have
bring
her
to
this
desolation
?
<EOS>
He
be
go
on
a
strange
errand
 
to
ask
shelter
for
this
waif
.
<EOS>
then
there
occur
to
him
the
beautiful
story
Plutarch
<EOS>
somewhere
tell
of
the
delphic
woman
:
how
when
the
maenad
,
outworn
with
their
torch
-
light
wandering
,
lie
down
to
sleep
in
the
market
-
place
,
the
matron
come
and
stand
silently
round
them
to
keep
guard
over
their
slumber
;
then
,
when
they
wake
,
minister
to
them
tenderly
and
see
them
safely
to
their
own
border
.
<EOS>
He
could
trust
the
woman
he
be
go
to
for
have
heart
as
good
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
feel
himself
grow
old
this
evening
and
enter
on
a
new
phase
in
find
a
life
to
which
his
own
have
come
 
perhaps
as
a
rescue
;
but
how
to
make
sure
that
snatch
from
death
be
rescue
?
<EOS>
the
moment
of
find
a
fellow
-
creature
be
often
as
full
of
mingled
doubt
and
exultation
as
the
moment
of
find
an
idea
.
      
<EOS>
Life
be
a
various
mother
:
now
she
don
  
Her
plume
and
brilliant
,
climb
the
marble
stair
  
<EOS>
with
head
aloft
,
nor
ever
turn
her
eye
  
on
lackey
who
attend
her
;
now
she
dwell
  
Grim
-
clothe
,
up
darksome
allyes
,
breathe
hot
gin
,
  
and
scream
in
pauper
riot
.
                               
<EOS>
but
to
these
  
She
come
a
frugal
matron
,
neat
and
deft
,
  
with
cheerful
morning
thought
and
quick
device
  
to
find
the
much
in
little
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
house
be
not
noisy
:
the
front
parlor
look
on
the
river
,
and
the
back
on
garden
,
so
that
though
she
be
read
aloud
to
her
daughter
,
the
window
could
be
leave
open
to
freshen
the
air
of
the
small
double
room
where
a
lamp
and
two
candle
be
burn
.
<EOS>
the
candle
be
on
a
table
apart
for
Kate
,
who
be
draw
illustration
for
a
publisher
;
the
lamp
be
not
only
for
the
reader
but
for
Amy
and
Mab
,
who
be
embroider
satin
cushion
for
"
the
great
world
.
"
  
<EOS>
outside
,
the
house
look
very
narrow
and
shabby
,
the
bright
light
through
the
holland
blind
show
the
heavy
old
-
fashioned
window
-
frame
;
but
it
be
pleasant
to
know
that
many
such
grim
-
walled
slice
of
space
in
our
foggy
London
have
be
and
still
be
the
home
of
a
culture
the
more
spotlessly
free
from
vulgarity
,
because
poverty
have
render
everything
like
display
an
impersonal
question
,
and
all
the
grand
show
of
the
world
simply
a
spectacle
which
rouse
petty
rivalry
or
vain
effort
after
possession
.
  
<EOS>
the
Meyricks
'
be
a
home
of
that
kind
:
and
they
all
cling
to
this
particular
house
in
a
row
because
its
interior
be
fill
with
object
always
in
the
same
place
,
which
,
for
the
mother
hold
memory
of
her
marriage
time
,
and
for
the
young
one
<EOS>
seem
as
necessary
and
uncriticise
a
part
of
their
world
as
the
star
of
the
Great
Bear
see
from
the
back
window
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
have
bear
much
stint
of
other
matter
that
she
may
be
able
to
keep
some
engraving
specially
cherish
by
her
husband
;
and
the
narrow
space
of
wall
hold
a
world
history
in
scene
and
head
which
the
child
have
early
learn
by
heart
.
<EOS>
the
chair
and
table
be
also
old
friend
prefer
to
new
.
<EOS>
but
in
these
two
little
parlor
with
no
furniture
that
a
broker
would
have
care
to
cheapen
except
the
print
and
piano
,
there
be
space
and
apparatus
for
a
wide
-
glance
,
nicely
-
select
life
,
open
to
the
high
thing
in
music
,
painting
and
poetry
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
sure
that
in
the
time
of
great
scarcity
,
before
Kate
could
get
pay
-
work
,
these
lady
have
always
have
a
servant
to
light
their
fire
and
sweep
their
room
;
yet
they
be
fastidious
in
some
point
,
and
could
not
believe
that
the
manner
of
lady
in
the
fashionable
world
be
so
full
of
coarse
selfishness
,
petty
quarreling
,
and
slang
as
they
be
represent
to
be
in
what
be
call
literary
photograph
.
<EOS>
the
Meyricks
have
their
little
oddity
,
streak
of
eccentricity
from
the
mother
's
blood
as
well
as
the
father
's
,
their
mind
be
like
mediæval
house
with
unexpected
recess
and
opening
from
this
into
that
,
flight
of
step
and
sudden
outlook
.
  
<EOS>
but
mother
and
daughter
be
all
unite
by
a
triple
bond
 
family
love
;
admiration
for
the
fine
work
,
the
good
action
;
and
habitual
industry
.
<EOS>
han
'
desire
to
spend
some
of
his
money
in
make
their
life
more
luxurious
have
be
resist
by
all
of
them
,
and
both
they
and
he
have
be
thus
save
from
regret
at
the
threaten
triumph
of
his
yearning
for
art
over
the
attraction
of
secured
income
 
a
triumph
that
would
by
-
and
-
by
oblige
him
to
give
up
his
fellowship
.
<EOS>
They
could
all
afford
to
laugh
at
his
Gavarni
-
caricature
and
to
hold
him
blameless
in
follow
a
natural
bent
which
their
unselfishness
and
independence
have
leave
without
obstacle
.
<EOS>
It
be
enough
for
them
to
go
on
in
their
old
way
,
only
have
a
grand
treat
of
opera
-
go
(
to
the
gallery
)
when
Hans
come
home
on
a
visit
.
  
<EOS>
see
the
group
they
make
this
evening
,
one
could
hardly
wish
them
to
change
their
way
of
life
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
alike
small
,
and
so
in
due
proportion
to
their
miniature
room
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
be
read
aloud
from
a
french
book
;
she
be
a
lively
little
woman
,
half
French
,
half
Scotch
,
with
a
pretty
articulateness
of
speech
that
seem
to
make
daylight
in
her
hearer

understanding
.
<EOS>
though
she
be
not

fifty

her
rippling
hair

cover
by
a
quakerish
net
cap

be
chiefly
gray
,
but
her
eyebrow
be
brown
as
the
bright
eye
below
them
;
her
black
dress
,
almost
like
a
priest
's
cassock
with
its
row
of
button
,
suit
a
neat
figure
hardly
five
foot
high
.
<EOS>
the
daughter
be
to
match
the
mother

except
that
Mab
have
Hans

light
hair
and
complexion
,
with
a
bossy
,
irregular
brow
,
and
other
quaintness
that
remind
one
of
him
.
<EOS>
everything
about
them
be
compact
,
from
the
firm
coil
of
their
hair

fasten
back
_

Chinoise

,
to
their
gray
skirt
in
Puritan
nonconformity
with
the
fashion
,
which
at
that
time
would
have
demand
that
four
feminine
circumference
should
fill
all
the
free
space
in
the
front
parlor
.
<EOS>
all
four
,
if
they
have
be
wax

work
,
may
have
be
pack
easily
in
a
fashionable
lady

travel
trunk
.
<EOS>
Their
face
seem
full
of
speech
,
as
if
their
mind
have
be
shell
,
after
the
manner
of
horse

chestnut

and
become
brightly
visible

<EOS>
the
only
large

comfortably
poise
on

under
this
appeal
to
their
compassion

<EOS>
Mab
look
rather
awe

stricken

as

something
preternatural

<EOS>
meanwhile

she
make
a
picture
that

<EOS>
at
first
she

a
little
dazed
by
the
sudden

her

He

the
dark

<EOS>
the

not

in
that
undefinable
change
which

<EOS>
for
an
instant

<EOS>
to
say
that
Deronda
be
romantic
would
be
to
misrepresent
him
;
but
under
his
calm
and
somewhat
self

repress
exterior
there
be
a
fervor
which
make
him
easily
find
poetry

romance
among
the

and
perhaps
poetry
and
romance
be
as
plentiful
as
ever
in
the
world
except
for
those
phlegmatic
nature
who
I
suspect
<EOS>
would
in
any
age
have
regard
them
as
a
dull
form
of
erroneous
thinking

<EOS>
They
exist
very
easily
in

with
the
microscope
and
even
in
railway
carriage
:
what
banish
them
in
the
vacuum
in
gentleman

<EOS>
how
should
all
the

of
heaven
and

,
from
the
farth

to
the
tender
bosom
of
the

who
nourish

no

no

which
thrill
from

to
the
distant
,
and
back
again
from
the

to

near
?
  
<EOS>
to
Deronda
this
event
of
find
Mirah
be
as
heart
-
stir
as
anything
that
befall
Orestes
or
Rinaldo
.
<EOS>
He
sit
up
half
the
night
,
live
again
through
the
moment
since
he
have
first
discern
Mirah
on
the
river
-
brink
,
with
the
fresh
and
fresh
vividness
which
belong
to
emotive
memory
.
<EOS>
when
he
take
up
a
book
to
try
and
dull
this
urgency
of
inward
vision
,
the
print
word
be
no
more
than
a
network
through
which
he
see
and
hear
everything
as
clearly
as
before
 
see
not
only
the
actual
event
of
two
hour
,
but
possibility
of
what
have
be
and
what
may
be
which
those
event
be
enough
to
feed
with
the
warm
blood
of
passionate
hope
and
fear
.
<EOS>
something
in
his
own
experience
cause
Mirah
's
search
after
her
mother
to
lay
hold
with
peculiar
force
on
his
imagination
.
<EOS>
the
first
prompting
of
sympathy
be
to
aid
her
in
her
search
:
if
give
person
be
extant
in
London
there
be
way
of
find
them
,
as
subtle
as
scientific
experiment
,
the
right
machinery
be
set
at
work
.
<EOS>
but
here
the
mixed
feeling
which
belong
to
Deronda
's
kindred
experience
naturally
transfuse
themselves
into
his
anxiety
on
behalf
of
Mirah
.
  
<EOS>
the
desire
to
know
his
own
mother
,
or
to
know
about
her
,
be
constantly
haunt
with
dread
;
and
in
imagine
what
may
befall
Mirah
it
quickly
occur
to
him
that
find
the
mother
and
brother
from
whom
she
have
be
part
when
she
be
a
little
one
may
turn
out
to
be
a
calamity
.
<EOS>
when
she
be
in
the
boat
she
say
that
her
mother
and
brother
be
good
;
but
the
goodness
may
have
be
chiefly
in
her
own
ignorant
innocence
and
yearning
memory
,
and
the
ten
or
twelve
year
since
the
parting
have
be
time
enough
for
much
worsening
.
<EOS>
spite
of
his
strong
tendency
to
side
with
the
object
of
prejudice
,
and
in
general
with
those
who
get
the
bad
of
it
,
his
interest
have
never
be
practically
draw
toward
exist
Jews
,
and
the
fact
he
know
about
them
,
whether
they
walk
conspicuous
in
fine
apparel
or
lurk
in
by
-
street
,
be
chiefly
of
a
sort
most
repugnant
to
him
.
<EOS>
of
learn
and
accomplish
Jews
<EOS>
he
take
it
for
grant
that
they
have
drop
their
religion
,
and
wish
to
be
merge
in
the
people
of
their
native
land
.
<EOS>
Scorn
fling
at
a
Jew
as
such
would
have
rouse
all
his
sympathy
in
griefs
of
inheritance
;
but
<EOS>
the
indiscriminate
scorn
of
a
race
will
often
strike
a
speciman
who
have
well
earn
it
on
his
own
account
,
and
may
fairly
be
gibbet
as
a
rascally
son
of
Adam
.
<EOS>
It
appear
that
the
Caribs
,
who
know
little
of
theology
,
regard
thieving
as
a
practice
peculiarly
connect
with
christian
tenet
,
and
probably
they
could
allege
experimental
ground
for
this
opinion
.
<EOS>
Deronda
could
not
escape
(
who
can
?
)
<EOS>
know
ugly
story
of
jewish
characteristic
and
occupation
;
and
though
one
of
his
favorite
protest
be
against
the
severance
of
past
and
present
history
,
he
be
like
other
who
share
his
protest
,
in
never
have
care
to
reach
any
more
special
conclusion
about
actual
Jews
than
that
they
retain
the
virtue
and
vice
of
a
long
-
oppress
race
.
<EOS>
but
now
that
Mirah
's
longing
rouse
his
mind
to
a
close
survey
of
detail
,
very
disagreeable
image
urge
themselves
of
what
it
may
be
to
find
out
this
middle
-
aged
Jewess
and
her
son
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
there
be
the
exquisite
refinement
and
charm
of
the
creature
herself
to
make
a
presumption
in
favor
of
her
immediate
kindred
,
but
 
he
must
wait
to
know
more
:
perhaps
through
Mrs.
Meyrick
he
may
gather
some
guide
hint
from
Mirah
's
own
lip
.
<EOS>
Her
voice
,
her
accent
,
her
look
 
all
the
sweet
purity
that
clothe
her
as
with
a
consecrate
garment
make
him
shrink
the
more
from
give
her
,
either
ideally
or
practically
,
an
association
with
what
be
hateful
or
contaminating
.
<EOS>
but
these
fine
word
with
which
we
fumigate
and
becloud
unpleasant
fact
be
not
the
language
in
which
we
think
.
<EOS>
Deronda
's
thinking
go
on
in
rapid
image
of
what
may
be
:
he
see
himself
guide
by
some
official
scout
into
a
dingy
street
;
he
enter
through
a
dim
doorway
,
and
see
a
hawk
-
eyed
woman
,
rough
-
head
,
and
unwashed
,
cheapen
a
hungry
girl
's
last
bit
of
finery
;
or
in
some
quarter
only
the
more
hideous
for
be
smart
,
he
find
himself
under
the
breath
of
a
young
Jew
talkative
and
familiar
,
willing
to
show
his
acquaintance
with
gentleman
's
taste
,
and
not
fastidious
in
any
transaction
with
which
they
would
favor
him
 
and
so
on
through
the
brief
chapter
of
his
experience
in
this
kind
.
<EOS>
excuse
him
:
<EOS>
his
mind
be
not
apt
to
run
spontaneously
into
insulting
idea
,
or
to
practice
a
form
of
wit
which
identify
Moses
with
the
advertisement
sheet
;
but
he
be
just
now
govern
by
dread
,
and
if
Mirah
's
parent
have
be
Christian
,
the
chief
difference
would
have
be
that
his
foreboding
would
have
be
feed
with
wide
knowledge
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
habit
of
his
mind
to
connect
dread
with
unknown
parentage
,
and
in
this
case
as
well
as
his
own
there
be
enough
to
make
the
connection
reasonable
.
  
<EOS>
but
what
be
to
be
do
with
Mirah
?
<EOS>
She
need
shelter
and
protection
in
the
full
sense
,
and
all
his
chivalrous
sentiment
rouse
itself
to
insist
that
the
sooner
and
the
more
fully
he
could
engage
for
her
the
interest
of
other
besides
himself
,
the
well
he
should
fulfill
her
claim
on
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
right
to
provide
for
her
entirely
,
though
he
may
be
able
to
do
so
;
the
very
depth
of
the
impression
she
have
produce
make
him
desire
that
she
should
understand
herself
to
be
entirely
independent
of
him
;
and
vague
vision
of
the
future
which
he
try
to
dispel
as
fantastic
leave
their
influence
in
an
anxiety
strong
than
any
motive
he
could
give
for
it
,
that
those
who
see
his
action
closely
should
be
acquaint
from
the
first
with
the
history
of
his
relation
to
Mirah
.
<EOS>
He
have
learn
to
hate
secrecy
about
the
grand
tie
and
obligation
of
his
life
 
to
hate
it
the
more
because
a
strong
spell
of
interwoven
sensibility
hinder
him
from
break
such
secrecy
.
<EOS>
Deronda
have
make
a
vow
to
himself
that
 
since
the
truth
which
disgrace
mortal
be
not
all
of
their
own
making
 
<EOS>
the
truth
should
never
be
make
a
disgrace
to
another
by
his
act
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
without
terror
lest
he
should
break
this
vow
,
and
fall
into
the
apologetic
philosophy
which
explain
the
world
into
contain
nothing
well
than
one
's
own
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
at
one
moment
he
resolve
to
tell
the
whole
of
his
adventure
to
Sir
Hugo
and
Lady
Mallinger
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
,
but
the
possibility
that
something
quite
new
may
reveal
itself
on
his
next
visit
to
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
check
this
impulse
,
and
he
finally
go
to
sleep
on
the
conclusion
that
he
would
wait
until
that
visit
have
be
make
.
        
<EOS>
"
It
will
hardly
be
deny
that
even
in
this
frail
and
corrupt
world
,
    
we
sometimes
meet
person
who
,
in
their
very
mien
and
aspect
,
as
well
    
as
in
the
whole
habit
of
life
,
manifest
such
a
signature
and
stamp
of
    
virtue
,
as
to
make
our
judgment
of
them
a
matter
of
intuition
rather
    
than
the
result
of
continue
 
examination

can
dream
myself
back
into
that
time
when
I
be
awake
,
and
it
often
come
back
to
me
in
my
sleep
 
<EOS>
my
hand
be
very
little
,
I
put
it
up
to
her
face
<EOS>
and
she
kiss
it
.
<EOS>
sometimes
in
my
dream
I
begin
to
tremble
and
think
that
we
be
both
dead
;
but
then
I
wake
up
and
my
hand
lie
like
this
,
and
for
a
moment
I
hardly
know
myself
.
<EOS>
but
if
I
could
see
my
mother
again
I
should
know
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
expect
some
change
after
twelve
year
,
"
say
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
gently
.
<EOS>
"
see
my
grey
hair
:
ten
year
ago
it
be
bright
brown
.
<EOS>
the
day
and
month
pace
over
us
like
restless
little
bird
,
and
leave
the
mark
of
their
foot
backward
and
forward
;
especially
when
they
be
like
bird
with
heavy
heart
-
then
they
tread
heavily
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
I
be
sure
her
heart
have
be
heavy
for
want
of
me
.
<EOS>
but
to
feel
her
joy
if
we
could
meet
again
,
and
I
could
make
her
know
I
love
her
and
give
her
deep
comfort
after
all
her
mourning
!
<EOS>
if
that
could
be
,
I
should
mind
nothing
;
I
should
be
glad
that
I
have
live
through
my
trouble
.
<EOS>
I
do
despair
.
<EOS>
the
world
seem
miserable
and
wicked
;
none
help
me
so
that
I
could
bear
their
look
and
word
;
I
feel
that
my
mother
be
dead
,
and
death
be
the
only
way
to
her
.
<EOS>
but
then
in
the
last
moment
 
yesterday
,
when
I
long
for
the
water
to
close
over
me
 
<EOS>
and
I
think
that
death
be
the
good
image
of
mercy
 
<EOS>
then
goodness
come
to
me
live
,
and
I
feel
trust
in
the
living
.
<EOS>
and
 
it
be
strange
 
<EOS>
but
I
begin
to
hope
that
she
be
live
too
.
<EOS>
and
now
I
with
you
 
here
 
this
morning
,
peace
and
hope
have
come
into
me
like
a
flood
.
<EOS>
I
want
nothing
;
I
can
wait
;
because
I
hope
and
believe
and
be
grateful
 
<EOS>
oh
,
so
grateful
!
<EOS>
You
have
not
think
evil
of
me
 
<EOS>
you
have
not
despise
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
speak
with
low
-
toned
fervor
,
and
sit
as
still
as
a
picture
all
the
while
.
  
<EOS>
"
many
other
would
have
feel
as
we
do
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
feel
a
mist
come
over
her
eye
as
she
look
at
her
work
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
not
meet
them
 
<EOS>
they
do
not
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
it
that
you
be
take
from
your
mother
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
I
be
a
long
while
come
to
that
.
<EOS>
It
be
dreadful
to
speak
of
,
yet
I
must
tell
you
 
I
must
tell
you
everything
.
<EOS>
My
father
 
<EOS>
it
be
he
that
take
me
away
.
<EOS>
I
think
we
be
only
go
on
a
little
journey
;
and
I
be
pleased
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
box
with
all
my
little
thing
in
.
<EOS>
but
we
go
on
board
a
ship
,
and
get
farther
and
farther
away
from
the
land
.
<EOS>
then
I
be
ill
;
and
I
think
it
would
never
end
 
<EOS>
it
be
the
first
misery
,
and
it
seem
endless
.
<EOS>
but
at
last
we
land
.
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
then
,
and
believe
what
my
father
say
.
<EOS>
He
comfort
me
,
and
tell
me
I
should
go
back
to
my
mother
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
America
we
have
reach
,
and
it
be
long
year
before
we
come
back
to
Europe
.
<EOS>
at
first
I
often
ask
my
father
when
we
be
go
back
;
and
I
try
to
learn
write
fast
,
because
I
want
to
write
to
my
mother
;
but
one
day
when
he
find
me
try
to
write
a
letter
,
he
take
me
on
his
knee
and
tell
me
that
my
mother
and
brother
be
dead
;
that
be
why
we
do
not
go
back
.
<EOS>
I
remember
my
brother
a
little
;
he
carry
me
once
;
but
he
be
not
always
at
home
.
<EOS>
I
believe
my
father
when
he
say
that
they
be
dead
.
<EOS>
I
see
them
under
the
earth
when
he
say
they
be
there
,
with
their
eye
forever
closed
.
<EOS>
I
never
think
of
its
not
be
true
;
and
I
use
to
cry
every
night
in
my
bed
for
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
then
when
she
come
so
often
to
me
,
in
my
sleep
,
I
think
she
must
be
live
about
me
though
I
could
not
always
see
her
,
and
that
comfort
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
never
afraid
in
the
dark
,
because
of
that
;
and
very
often
in
the
day
I
use
to
shut
my
eye
and
bury
my
face
and
try
to
see
her
and
to
hear
her
singing
.
<EOS>
I
come
to
do
that
at
last
without
shut
my
eye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
pause
with
a
sweet
content
in
her
face
,
as
if
she
be
have
her
happy
vision
,
while
she
look
out
toward
the
river
.
  
<EOS>
"
still
your
father
be
not
unkind
to
you
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
"
say
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
after
a
minute
,
anxious
to
recall
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
he
pet
me
,
and
take
pain
to
teach
me
.
<EOS>
He
be
an
actor
;
and
I
find
out
,
after
,
that
the
"
Coburg
"
I
use
to
hear
of
his
go
to
at
home
be
a
theatre
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
more
to
do
with
the
theatre
than
act
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
always
be
an
actor
;
he
have
be
a
teacher
,
and
know
many
language
.
<EOS>
His
acting
be
not
very
good
;
I
think
,
but
he
manage
the
stage
,
and
write
and
translate
play
.
<EOS>
an
italian
lady
,
a
singer
,
live
with
us
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
They
both
teach
me
,
and
I
have
a
master
besides
,
who
make
me
learn
by
heart
and
recite
.
<EOS>
I
work
quite
hard
,
though
I
be
so
little
;
and
I
be
not
nine
when
I
first
go
on
the
stage
.
<EOS>
I
could
easily
learn
thing
,
and
I
be
not
afraid
.
<EOS>
but
then
and
ever
since
I
hate
our
way
of
life
.
<EOS>
My
father
have
money
,
and
we
have
finery
about
us
in
a
disorderly
way
;
always
there
be
man
and
woman
come
and
go
;
there
be
loud
laughing
and
dispute
,
strut
,
snapping
of
finger
,
jeering
,
face
I
do
not
like
to
look
at
 
though
many
pet
and
caress
me
.
<EOS>
but
then
I
remember
my
mother
.
<EOS>
even
at
first
when
I
understand
nothing
,
I
shrink
away
from
all
those
thing
outside
me
into
companionship
with
thought
that
be
not
like
them
;
and
I
gather
thought
very
fast
,
because
I
read
many
thing
 
play
and
poetry
,
Shakespeare
and
Schiller
,
and
learn
evil
and
good
.
<EOS>
My
father
begin
to
believe
that
I
may
be
a
great
singer
:
my
voice
be
consider
wonderful
for
a
child
;
and
he
have
the
good
teaching
for
me
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
painful
that
he
boast
of
me
,
and
set
me
to
sing
for
show
at
any
minute
,
as
if
I
have
be
a
musical
box
.
<EOS>
once
when
I
be
nine
year
old
,
I
play
the
part
of
a
little
girl
who
have
be
forsake
and
do
not
know
it
,
and
sit
singe
to
herself
while
she
play
with
flower
.
<EOS>
I
do
it
without
any
trouble
;
but
the
clapping
and
all
the
sound
of
the
theatre
be
hateful
to
me
;
and
I
never
like
the
praise
I
have
,
because
it
all
seem
very
hard
and
unlove
<EOS>
:
I
miss
the
love
and
trust
I
have
be
bear
into
.
<EOS>
I
make
a
life
in
my
own
thought
quite
different
from
everything
about
me
:
I
choose
what
seem
to
me
beautiful
out
of
the
play
and
everything
,
and
make
my
world
out
of
it
;
and
it
be
like
a
sharp
knife
always
graze
me
that
we
have
two
sort
of
life
which
jar
so
with
each
other
 
woman
look
good
and
gentle
on
the
stage
,
and
say
good
thing
as
if
they
feel
them
,
and
directly
after
I
see
them
with
coarse
,
ugly
manner
.
<EOS>
My
father
sometimes
notice
my
shrink
way
;
and
Signora
say
one
day
,
when
I
have
be
rehearse
,
"
She
will
never
be
an
artist
:
she
have
no
notion
of
be
anybody
but
herself
.
<EOS>
that
do
very
well
now
,
but
by
-
and
-
by
you
will
see
 
she
will
have
no
more
face
and
action
than
a
singing
-
bird
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
be
angry
,
and
they
quarrel
.
<EOS>
I
sit
alone
and
cry
,
because
what
she
have
say
be
like
a
long
unhappy
future
unroll
before
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
to
be
an
artist
;
but
this
be
what
my
father
expect
of
me
.
<EOS>
after
a
while
Signora
leave
us
,
and
a
governess
use
to
come
and
give
me
lesson
in
different
thing
,
because
my
father
begin
to
be
afraid
of
my
singing
too
much
;
but
I
still
act
from
time
to
time
.
<EOS>
rebellious
feeling
grow
strong
in
me
,
and
I
wish
to
get
away
from
this
life
;
but
I
could
not
tell
where
to
go
,
and
I
dread
the
world
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
feel
it
would
be
wrong
to
leave
my
father
:
I
dread
do
wrong
,
for
I
think
I
may
get
wicked
and
hateful
to
myself
,
in
the
same
way
that
many
other
seem
hateful
to
me
.
<EOS>
for
so
long
,
so
long
I
have
never
feel
my
outside
world
happy
;
and
if
I
get
wicked
I
should
lose
my
world
of
happy
thought
where
my
mother
live
with
me
.
<EOS>
that
be
my
childish
notion
all
through
those
year
.
<EOS>
oh
how
long
they
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
fall
to
muse
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
no
teaching
about
what
be
your
duty
?
"
say
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
like
to
say
"
religion
"
 
find
herself
on
inspection
rather
dim
as
to
what
the
hebrew
religion
may
have
turn
into
at
this
date
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
 
only
that
I
ought
to
do
what
my
father
wish
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
follow
our
religion
at
New
York
,
and
I
think
he
want
me
not
to
know
much
about
it
.
<EOS>
but
because
my
mother
use
to
take
me
to
the
synagogue
,
and
I
remember
sit
on
her
knee
and
look
through
the
railing
and
hear
the
chant
and
singing
,
I
long
to
go
.
<EOS>
one
day
when
I
be
quite
small
I
slip
out
and
try
to
find
the
synagogue
,
but
I
lose
myself
a
long
while
till
a
peddler
question
me
and
take
me
home
.
<EOS>
My
father
,
miss
me
,
have
be
much
in
fear
,
and
be
very
angry
.
<EOS>
I
too
have
be
so
frightened
at
lose
myself
that
it
be
long
before
I
think
of
venture
out
again
.
<EOS>
but
after
Signora
leave
us
we
go
to
room
where
our
landlady
be
a
Jewess
and
observe
her
religion
.
<EOS>
I
ask
her
to
take
me
with
her
to
the
synagogue
;
and
I
read
in
her
prayer
-
book
and
Bible
,
and
when
I
have
money
enough
I
ask
her
to
buy
me
book
of
my
own
,
for
these
book
<EOS>
seem
a
close
companionship
with
my
mother
<EOS>
:
I
know
that
she
must
have
look
at
the
very
word
and
say
them
.
<EOS>
in
that
way
I
have
come
to
know
a
little
of
our
religion
,
and
the
history
of
our
people
,
besides
piece
together
what
I
read
in
play
and
other
book
about
Jews
and
Jewesses
;
because
I
be
sure
my
mother
obey
her
religion
.
<EOS>
I
have
leave
off
ask
my
father
about
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
dreadful
to
say
it
,
but
I
begin
to
disbelieve
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
find
that
he
do
not
always
tell
the
truth
,
and
make
promise
without
mean
to
keep
them
;
and
that
raise
my
suspicion
that
my
mother
and
brother
be
still
alive
though
he
have
tell
me
they
be
dead
.
<EOS>
for
in
go
over
the
past
again
as
I
get
old
and
know
more
,
I
feel
sure
that
my
mother
have
be
deceive
,
and
have
expect
to
see
us
back
again
after
a
very
little
while
;
and
my
father
take
me
on
his
knee
and
tell
me
that
my
mother
and
brother
be
both
dead
seem
to
me
now
but
a
bit
of
acting
,
to
set
my
mind
at
rest
.
<EOS>
the
cruelty
of
that
falsehood
sink
into
me
,
and
I
hate
all
untruth
because
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
write
to
my
mother
secretly
:
<EOS>
I
know
the
street
,
Colman
Street
,
where
we
live
,
and
that
it
be
not
Blackfriars
Bridge
and
the
Coburg
,
and
that
our
name
be
Cohen
then
,
though
my
father
call
us
Lapidoth
,
because
,
he
say
,
it
be
a
name
of
his
forefather
in
Poland
.
<EOS>
I
send
my
letter
secretly
;
but
no
answer
come
,
and
I
think
there
be
no
hope
for
me
.
<EOS>
Our
life
in
America
do
not
last
much
longer
.
<EOS>
My
father
suddenly
tell
me
we
be
to
pack
up
and
go
to
Hamburg
,
and
I
be
rather
glad
.
<EOS>
I
hope
we
may
get
among
a
different
sort
of
people
,
and
I
know
german
quite
well
 
<EOS>
some
german
play
almost
all
by
heart
.
<EOS>
My
father
speak
it
better
than
he
speak
English
.
<EOS>
I
be
thirteen
then
,
and
I
seem
to
myself
quite
old
 
<EOS>
I
know
so
much
,
and
yet
so
little
.
<EOS>
I
think
other
child
can
not
feel
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
wish
that
I
have
be
drown
when
I
be
go
away
from
my
mother
.
<EOS>
but
I
set
myself
to
obey
and
suffer
:
what
else
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
one
day
when
we
be
on
our
voyage
,
a
new
thought
come
into
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
very
ill
that
time
,
and
I
keep
on
deck
a
good
deal
.
<EOS>
My
father
act
and
sing
and
joke
to
amuse
people
on
board
,
and
I
use
often
to
hear
remark
about
him
.
<EOS>
one
day
,
when
I
be
look
at
the
sea
and
nobody
take
notice
of
me
,
I
overhear
a
gentleman
say
,
"
oh
,
he
be
one
of
those
clever
Jews
 
<EOS>
a
rascal
,
I
should
not
wonder
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
race
like
them
for
cunne
in
the
man
and
beauty
in
the
woman
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
market
he
mean
that
daughter
for
.
<EOS>
"
when
I
hear
this
it
dart
into
my
mind
that
the
unhappiness
in
my
life
come
from
my
be
a
Jewess
,
and
that
always
to
the
end
the
world
would
think
slightly
of
me
and
that
I
must
bear
it
,
for
I
should
be
judge
by
that
name
;
and
it
comfort
me
to
believe
that
my
suffering
be
part
of
the
affliction
of
my
people
,
my
part
in
the
long
song
of
mourning
that
have
be
go
on
through
age
and
age
.
<EOS>
for
if
many
of
our
race
be
wicked
and
make
merry
in
their
wickedness
 
<EOS>
what
be
that
<EOS>
but
part
of
the
affliction
bear
by
the
just
among
them
,
who
be
despise
for
the
sin
of
their
brother
?
 
<EOS>
but
you
have
not
reject
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
have
change
her
tone
in
this
last
sentence
,
have
suddenly
reflect
that
at
this
moment
she
have
reason
not
for
complaint
but
for
gratitude
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
we
will
try
to
save
you
from
be
judge
unjustly
by
other
,
my
poor
child
,
"
say
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
who
have
now
give
up
all
attempt
at
go
on
with
her
work
,
and
sit
listen
with
folded
hand
and
a
face
hardly
less
eager
than
Mab
's
would
have
be
.
<EOS>
"
go
on
,
go
on
:
tell
me
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
after
that
we
live
in
different
town
 
Hamburg
and
Vienna
,
the
long
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
study
singe
again
:
and
my
father
always
get
money
about
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
bring
a
good
deal
of
money
from
America
,
I
never
know
why
we
leave
.
<EOS>
for
some
time
he
be
in
great
spirit
about
my
singing
,
and
he
make
me
rehearse
part
and
act
continually
.
<EOS>
He
look
forward
to
my
come
out
in
the
opera
.
<EOS>
but
by
-
and
-
by
it
seem
that
my
voice
would
never
be
strong
enough
 
<EOS>
it
do
not
fulfill
its
promise
.
<EOS>
My
master
at
Vienna
say
,
"
do
not
strain
it
further
:
it
will
never
do
for
the
public
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
gold
,
but
a
thread
of
gold
dust
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
be
bitterly
disappointed
:
we
be
not
so
well
off
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
not
quite
tell
you
what
I
feel
about
my
father
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
be
fond
of
me
and
mean
to
indulge
me
,
and
that
make
me
afraid
of
hurt
him
;
but
he
always
mistake
what
would
please
me
and
give
me
happiness
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
nature
to
take
everything
lightly
;
and
I
soon
leave
off
ask
him
any
question
about
thing
that
I
care
for
much
,
because
he
always
turn
them
off
with
a
joke
.
<EOS>
He
would
even
ridicule
our
own
people
;
and
once
when
he
have
be
imitate
their
movement
and
their
tone
in
pray
,
only
to
make
other
laugh
,
I
could
not
restrain
myself
 
for
I
always
have
an
anger
in
my
heart
about
my
mother
 
<EOS>
and
when
we
be
alone
,
I
say
,
"
Father
,
you
ought
not
to
mimic
our
own
people
before
Christians
who
mock
them
:
would
it
not
be
bad
if
I
mimic
you
,
that
they
may
mock
you
?
"
<EOS>
but
he
only
shrug
his
shoulder
and
laugh
and
pinch
my
chin
,
and
say
,
'
You
could
not
do
it
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
this
way
of
turn
off
everything
,
that
make
a
great
wall
between
me
and
my
father
,
and
whatever
I
feel
most
<EOS>
I
take
the
most
care
to
hide
from
him
.
<EOS>
for
there
be
some
thing
 
when
they
be
laugh
at
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
it
:
the
world
seem
like
a
hell
to
me
.
<EOS>
be
this
world
and
all
the
life
upon
it
only
like
a
farce
or
a
vaudeville
,
where
you
find
no
great
meaning
?
<EOS>
why
then
be
there
tragedy
and
grand
opera
,
where
man
do
difficult
thing
and
choose
to
suffer
?
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
silly
to
speak
of
all
thing
as
a
joke
.
<EOS>
and
I
see
that
his
wish
me
to
sing
the
great
music
,
and
part
in
grand
opera
,
be
only
wish
for
what
would
fetch
the
great
price
.
<EOS>
that
hem
in
my
gratitude
for
his
affectionateness
,
and
the
tender
feeling
I
have
toward
him
be
pity
.
<EOS>
yes
,
I
do
sometimes
pity
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
age
and
change
.
<EOS>
now
he
be
no
longer
so
lively
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
seem
bad
 
less
good
to
other
than
to
me
.
<EOS>
every
now
and
then
in
the
latter
year
his
gaiety
go
away
suddenly
,
and
he
would
sit
at
home
silent
and
gloomy
;
or
he
would
come
in
and
fle
himself
down
and
sob
,
just
as
I
have
do
myself
when
I
have
be
in
trouble
.
<EOS>
if
I
put
my
hand
on
his
knee
and
say
,
"
what
be
the
matter
,
father
?
"
he
would
make
no
answer
,
but
would
draw
my
arm
round
his
neck
and
put
his
arm
round
me
and
go
on
cry
.
<EOS>
there
never
come
any
confidence
between
us
;
but
oh
,
I
be
sorry
for
him
.
<EOS>
at
those
moment
I
know
he
must
feel
his
life
bitter
,
and
I
press
my
cheek
against
his
head
and
pray
.
<EOS>
those
moment
be
what
most
bind
me
to
him
;
and
I
use
to
think
how
much
my
mother
once
love
him
,
else
she
would
not
have
marry
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
soon
there
come
the
dreadful
time
.
<EOS>
We
have
be
at
Pesth
and
we
come
back
to
Vienna
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
what
my
master
Leo
have
say
,
my
father
get
me
an
engagement
,
not
at
the
opera
,
but
to
take
singe
part
at
a
suburb
theatre
in
Vienna
.
<EOS>
He
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
theatre
then
;
I
do
not
understand
what
he
do
,
but
I
think
he
be
continually
at
a
gambling
house
,
though
he
be
careful
always
about
take
me
to
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
miserable
.
<EOS>
the
play
I
act
in
be
detestable
to
me
.
<EOS>
man
come
about
us
and
want
to
talk
to
me
<EOS>
:
woman
and
man
seem
to
look
at
me
with
a
sneer
smile
;
it
be
no
well
than
a
fiery
furnace
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
make
it
bad
than
it
be
 
<EOS>
you
do
not
know
that
life
:
but
the
glare
and
the
face
,
and
my
have
to
go
on
and
act
and
sing
what
I
hate
,
and
then
see
people
who
come
to
stare
at
me
behind
the
scene
 
<EOS>
it
be
all
so
much
bad
than
when
I
be
a
little
girl
.
<EOS>
I
go
through
with
it
;
I
do
it
;
I
have
set
my
mind
to
obey
my
father
and
work
,
for
I
see
nothing
well
that
I
could
do
.
<EOS>
but
I
feel
that
my
voice
be
get
weak
,
and
I
know
that
my
acting
be
not
good
except
when
it
be
not
really
act
,
but
the
part
be
one
that
I
could
be
myself
in
,
and
some
feeling
within
me
carry
me
along
.
<EOS>
that
be
seldom
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
in
the
midst
of
all
this
,
the
news
come
to
me
one
morning
that
my
father
have
be
take
to
prison
,
and
he
have
send
for
me
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
tell
me
the
reason
why
he
be
there
,
but
he
order
me
to
go
to
an
address
he
give
me
,
to
see
a
Count
who
would
be
able
to
get
him
release
.
<EOS>
the
address
be
to
some
public
room
where
I
be
to
ask
for
the
Count
,
and
beg
him
to
come
to
my
father
.
<EOS>
I
find
him
,
and
recognize
him
as
a
gentleman
whom
I
have
see
the
other
night
for
the
first
time
behind
the
scene
.
<EOS>
that
agitate
me
,
for
I
remember
his
way
of
look
at
me
and
kiss
my
hand
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
in
mockery
.
<EOS>
but
I
deliver
my
errand
,
and
he
promise
to
go
immediately
to
my
father
,
who
come
home
again
that
very
evening
,
bring
the
Count
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
now
begin
to
feel
a
horrible
dread
of
this
man
,
for
he
worry
me
with
his
attention
,
his
eye
be
always
on
me
:
I
feel
sure
that
whatever
else
there
may
be
in
his
mind
toward
me
,
below
it
all
there
be
scorn
for
the
Jewess
and
the
actress
.
<EOS>
and
when
he
come
to
me
the
next
day
in
the
theatre
and
would
put
my
shawl
around
me
,
a
terror
take
hold
of
me
;
I
see
that
my
father
want
me
to
look
pleased
.
<EOS>
the
Count
be
neither
very
young
nor
very
old
;
his
hair
and
eye
be
pale
;
he
be
tall
and
walk
heavily
,
and
his
face
be
heavy
and
grave
except
when
he
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
He
smile
at
me
,
and
his
smile
go
through
me
with
horror
:
<EOS>
I
could
not
tell
why
he
be
so
much
bad
to
me
than
other
man
.
<EOS>
some
feeling
be
like
our
hearing
:
they
come
as
sound
do
,
before
we
know
their
reason
.
<EOS>
My
father
talk
to
me
about
him
when
we
be
alone
,
and
praise
him
 
say
what
a
good
friend
he
have
be
.
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
,
because
I
suppose
he
have
get
my
father
out
of
prison
.
<EOS>
when
the
Count
come
again
,
my
father
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
ask
me
if
I
like
be
on
the
stage
.
<EOS>
I
say
no
,
I
only
act
in
obedience
to
my
father
.
<EOS>
He
always
speak
French
,
and
call
me
"
petite
ange
"
and
such
thing
,
which
I
feel
insulting
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
mean
to
make
love
to
me
,
and
I
have
it
firmly
in
my
mind
that
a
nobleman
and
one
who
be
not
a
Jew
could
have
no
love
for
me
that
be
not
half
contempt
.
<EOS>
but
then
he
tell
me
that
I
need
not
act
any
longer
;
he
wish
me
to
visit
him
at
his
beautiful
place
,
where
I
may
be
queen
of
everything
.
<EOS>
It
be
difficult
to
me
to
speak
,
I
feel
so
shaken
with
anger
:
I
could
only
say
,
"
I
would
rather
stay
on
the
stage
forever
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
leave
him
there
.
<EOS>
hurry
out
of
the
room
I
see
my
father
sauntering
in
the
passage
.
<EOS>
My
heart
be
crush
.
<EOS>
I
go
past
him
and
lock
myself
up
.
<EOS>
It
have
sink
into
me
that
my
father
be
in
a
conspiracy
with
that
man
against
me
.
<EOS>
but
the
next
day
he
persuade
me
to
come
out
:
he
say
that
I
have
mistake
everything
,
and
he
would
explain
:
if
I
do
not
come
out
and
act
and
fulfill
my
engagement
,
we
should
be
ruin
and
he
must
starve
.
<EOS>
so
I
go
on
acting
,
and
for
a
week
or
more
the
Count
never
come
near
me
.
<EOS>
My
father
change
our
lodging
,
and
keep
at
home
except
when
he
go
to
the
theatre
with
me
.
<EOS>
He
begin
one
day
to
speak
discouragingly
of
my
acting
,
and
say
,
I
could
never
go
on
singe
in
public
 
<EOS>
I
should
lose
my
voice
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
think
of
my
future
,
and
not
put
my
nonsensical
feeling
between
me
and
my
fortune
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
what
will
you
do
?
<EOS>
You
will
be
bring
down
to
sing
and
beg
at
people
's
door
.
<EOS>
You
have
have
a
splendid
offer
and
ought
to
accept
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
speak
:
a
horror
take
possession
of
me
when
I
think
of
my
mother
and
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
feel
for
the
first
time
that
I
should
not
do
wrong
to
leave
him
.
<EOS>
but
the
next
day
he
tell
me
that
he
have
put
an
end
to
my
engagement
at
the
theatre
,
and
that
we
be
to
go
to
Prague
.
<EOS>
I
be
get
suspicious
of
everything
,
and
my
will
be
harden
to
act
against
him
.
<EOS>
It
take
us
two
day
to
pack
and
get
ready
;
and
I
have
it
in
my
mind
that
I
may
be
oblige
to
run
away
from
my
father
,
and
then
I
would
come
to
London
and
try
if
it
be
possible
to
find
my
mother
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
little
money
,
and
I
sell
some
thing
to
get
more
.
<EOS>
I
pack
a
few
clothe
in
a
little
bag
that
I
could
carry
with
me
,
and
I
keep
my
mind
on
the
watch
.
<EOS>
My
father
's
silence
 
<EOS>
his
let
drop
<EOS>
that
subject
of
the
Count
's
offer
 
make
me
feel
sure
that
there
be
a
plan
against
me
.
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
it
have
be
a
plan
to
take
me
to
a
madhouse
.
<EOS>
I
once
see
a
picture
of
a
madhouse
,
that
I
could
never
forget
;
it
seem
to
me
very
much
like
some
of
the
life
I
have
see
 
the
people
strut
,
quarreling
,
leer
 
the
face
with
cunning
and
malice
in
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
my
will
to
keep
myself
from
wickedness
;
and
I
pray
for
help
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
what
despise
woman
be
:
and
my
heart
turn
against
my
father
,
for
I
see
always
behind
him
that
man
who
make
me
shudder
.
<EOS>
You
will
think
I
have
not
enough
reason
for
my
suspicion
,
and
perhaps
I
have
not
,
outside
my
own
feeling
;
but
it
seem
to
me
that
my
mind
have
be
light
up
,
and
all
that
may
be
stand
out
clear
and
sharp
.
<EOS>
if
I
sleep
,
it
be
only
to
see
the
same
sort
of
thing
,
and
I
could
hardly
sleep
at
all
.
<EOS>
through
our
journey
I
be
everywhere
on
the
watch
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
why
,
but
it
come
before
me
like
a
real
event
,
that
my
father
would
suddenly
leave
me
and
I
should
find
myself
with
the
Count
where
I
could
not
get
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
God
be
warn
me
:
my
mother
's
voice
be
in
my
soul
.
<EOS>
It
be
dark
when
we
reach
Prague
,
and
though
the
strange
bunche
of
lamp
be
light
it
be
difficult
to
distinguish
face
as
we
drive
along
the
street
.
<EOS>
My
father
choose
to
sit
outside
 
<EOS>
he
be
always
smoke
now
 
<EOS>
and
I
watch
everything
in
spite
of
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
I
do
believe
I
could
see
better
then
than
I
ever
do
before
:
the
strange
clearness
within
seem
to
have
get
outside
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
my
habit
to
notice
face
and
figure
much
in
the
street
;
but
this
night
I
see
every
one
;
and
when
we
pass
before
a
great
hotel
I
catch
sight
only
of
a
back
that
be
pass
in
 
the
light
of
the
great
bunch
of
lamp
a
good
way
off
fall
on
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
 
<EOS>
before
the
face
be
turn
,
as
it
fall
into
shadow
,
I
know
who
it
be
.
<EOS>
help
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
help
come
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
sleep
that
night
.
<EOS>
I
put
on
my
plain
thing
 
the
cloak
and
hat
<EOS>
I
have
wear
ever
since
;
and
I
sit
watch
for
the
light
and
the
sound
of
the
door
be
unbarred
.
<EOS>
some
one
rise
early
 
at
four
o'clock
,
to
go
to
the
railway
.
<EOS>
that
give
me
courage
.
<EOS>
I
slip
out
,
with
my
little
bag
under
my
cloak
,
and
none
notice
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
a
long
while
attend
to
the
railway
guide
that
I
may
learn
the
way
to
England
;
and
before
the
sun
have
rise
I
be
in
the
train
for
Dresden
.
<EOS>
then
I
cry
for
joy
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
my
money
would
last
out
,
but
I
trust
.
<EOS>
I
could
sell
the
thing
in
my
bag
,
and
the
little
ring
in
my
ear
,
and
I
could
live
on
bread
only
.
<EOS>
My
only
terror
be
lest
my
father
should
follow
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
never
pause
.
<EOS>
I
come
on
,
and
on
,
and
on
,
only
eat
bread
now
and
then
.
<EOS>
when
I
get
to
Brussels
<EOS>
I
see
that
I
should
not
have
enough
money
,
and
I
sell
all
that
I
could
sell
;
but
here
a
strange
thing
happen
.
<EOS>
put
my
hand
into
the
pocket
of
my
cloak
,
I
find
a
half
-
napoleon
.
<EOS>
wonder
and
wonder
how
it
come
there
,
I
remember
that
on
the
way
from
Cologne
there
be
a
young
workman
sit
against
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
frightened
at
every
one
,
and
do
not
like
to
be
speak
to
.
<EOS>
at
first
he
try
to
talk
,
but
when
he
see
that
I
do
not
like
it
,
he
leave
off
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
journey
;
I
eat
nothing
but
a
bit
of
bread
,
and
he
once
offer
me
some
of
the
food
he
bring
in
,
but
I
refuse
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
believe
it
be
he
who
put
that
bit
of
gold
in
my
pocket
.
<EOS>
without
it
I
could
hardly
have
get
to
Dover
,
and
I
do
walk
a
good
deal
of
the
way
from
Dover
to
London
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
should
look
like
a
miserable
beggar
-
girl
.
<EOS>
I
want
not
to
look
very
miserable
,
because
if
I
find
my
mother
it
would
grieve
her
to
see
me
so
.
<EOS>
but
oh
,
how
vain
my
hope
be
that
she
would
be
there
to
see
me
come
!
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
set
foot
in
London
,
I
begin
to
ask
for
Lambeth
and
Blackfriars
Bridge
,
but
they
be
a
long
way
off
,
and
I
go
wrong
.
<EOS>
at
last
I
get
to
Blackfriars
Bridge
and
ask
for
Colman
Street
.
<EOS>
People
shake
their
head
.
<EOS>
none
know
it
.
<EOS>
I
see
it
in
my
mind
 
our
doorstep
,
and
the
white
tile
hang
in
the
window
,
and
the
large
brick
building
opposite
with
wide
door
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
nothing
like
it
.
<EOS>
at
last
when
I
ask
a
tradesman
where
the
Coburg
Theatre
and
Colman
Street
be
,
he
say
,
"
oh
,
my
little
woman
,
that
be
all
do
away
with
.
<EOS>
the
old
street
have
be
pull
down
;
everything
be
new
.
<EOS>
"
I
turn
away
and
feel
as
if
death
have
lay
a
hand
on
me
.
<EOS>
He
say
:
"
stop
,
stop
!
<EOS>
young
woman
;
what
be
it
you
be
want
with
Colman
Street
,
eh
?
"
<EOS>
mean
well
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
but
his
tone
be
what
I
could
not
bear
;
and
how
could
I
tell
him
what
I
want
?
<EOS>
I
feel
blinded
and
bewilder
with
a
sudden
shock
.
<EOS>
I
suddenly
feel
that
I
be
very
weak
and
weary
,
and
yet
where
could
I
go
?
<EOS>
for
I
look
so
poor
and
dusty
,
and
have
nothing
with
me
 
<EOS>
I
look
like
a
street
-
beggar
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
afraid
of
all
place
where
I
could
enter
.
<EOS>
I
lose
my
trust
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
be
forsake
.
<EOS>
It
seem
that
I
have
be
in
a
fever
of
hope
 
<EOS>
delirious
 
all
the
way
from
Prague
<EOS>
:
I
think
that
I
be
help
,
and
I
do
nothing
but
strain
my
mind
forward
and
think
of
find
my
mother
;
and
now
 
there
I
stand
in
a
strange
world
.
<EOS>
all
who
see
me
would
think
ill
of
me
,
and
I
must
herd
with
beggar
.
<EOS>
I
stand
on
the
bridge
and
look
along
the
river
.
<EOS>
People
be
go
on
to
a
steamboat
.
<EOS>
many
of
them
seem
poor
,
and
I
feel
as
if
it
would
be
a
refuge
to
get
away
from
the
street
;
perhaps
the
boat
would
take
me
where
I
could
soon
get
into
a
solitude
.
<EOS>
I
have
still
some
pence
leave
,
and
I
buy
a
loaf
when
I
go
on
the
boat
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
have
a
little
time
and
strength
to
think
of
life
and
death
.
<EOS>
how
could
I
live
?
<EOS>
and
now
again
it
seem
that
if
ever
I
be
to
find
my
mother
again
,
death
be
the
way
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
eat
,
that
I
may
have
strength
to
think
.
<EOS>
the
boat
set
me
down
at
a
place
along
the
river
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
where
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
late
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
I
find
some
large
tree
apart
from
the
road
,
and
I
sit
down
under
them
that
I
may
rest
through
the
night
.
<EOS>
sleep
must
have
soon
come
to
me
,
and
when
I
awake
it
be
morning
.
<EOS>
the
bird
be
singe
,
and
the
dew
be
white
about
me
,
I
feel
chill
<EOS>
and
oh
,
so
lonely
!
<EOS>
I
get
up
and
walk
and
follow
the
river
a
long
way
and
then
turn
back
again
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
reason
why
I
should
go
anywhere
.
<EOS>
the
world
about
me
seem
like
a
vision
that
be
hurry
by
while
I
stand
still
with
my
pain
.
<EOS>
My
thought
be
strong
than
I
be
;
they
rush
in
and
force
me
to
see
all
my
life
from
the
beginning
;
ever
since
I
be
carry
away
from
my
mother
<EOS>
I
have
feel
myself
a
lose
child
take
up
and
use
by
stranger
,
who
do
not
care
what
my
life
be
to
me
,
but
only
what
I
could
do
for
them
.
<EOS>
It
seem
all
a
weary
wandering
and
heart
-
loneliness
 
as
if
I
have
be
force
to
go
to
merrymaking
without
the
expectation
of
joy
.
<EOS>
and
now
it
be
bad
.
<EOS>
I
be
lose
again
,
and
I
dread
lest
any
stranger
should
notice
me
and
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
terror
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
none
know
me
;
all
would
mistake
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
so
many
in
my
life
who
make
themselves
glad
with
scorning
,
and
laugh
at
another
's
shame
.
<EOS>
what
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
this
life
seem
to
be
close
in
upon
me
with
a
wall
of
fire
 
everywhere
there
be
scorch
that
make
me
shrink
.
<EOS>
the
high
sunlight
make
me
shrink
.
<EOS>
and
I
begin
to
think
that
my
despair
be
the
voice
of
God
tell
me
to
die
.
<EOS>
but
it
would
take
me
long
to
die
of
hunger
.
<EOS>
then
I
think
of
my
people
,
how
they
have
be
drive
from
land
to
land
and
be
afflict
,
and
multitude
have
die
of
misery
in
their
wander
 
<EOS>
be
I
the
first
?
<EOS>
and
in
the
war
and
trouble
when
Christians
be
cruel
,
our
father
have
sometimes
slay
their
child
and
afterward
themselves
<EOS>
:
it
be
to
save
them
from
be
false
apostate
.
<EOS>
that
seem
to
make
it
right
for
me
to
put
an
end
to
my
life
;
for
calamity
have
close
me
in
too
,
and
I
see
no
pathway
but
to
evil
.
<EOS>
but
my
mind
get
into
war
with
itself
,
for
there
be
contrary
thing
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
some
have
hold
it
wrong
to
hasten
their
own
death
,
though
they
be
in
the
midst
of
flame
;
and
while
I
have
some
strength
leave
<EOS>
it
be
a
longing
to
bear
if
I
ought
to
bear
 
else
<EOS>
where
be
the
good
of
all
my
life
?
<EOS>
It
have
not
be
happy
since
the
first
year
:
when
the
light
come
every
morning
I
use
to
think
,
"
I
will
bear
it
.
"
<EOS>
but
always
before
I
have
some
hope
;
now
it
be
go
.
<EOS>
with
these
thought
I
wander
and
wander
,
inwardly
cry
to
the
most
high
,
from
whom
I
should
not
flee
in
death
more
than
in
life
 
though
I
have
no
strong
faith
that
He
care
for
me
.
<EOS>
the
strength
seem
depart
from
my
soul
;
deep
below
all
my
cry
be
the
feeling
that
I
be
alone
and
forsaken
.
<EOS>
the
more
I
think
the
wearier
I
get
,
<EOS>
till
it
seem
I
be
not
think
at
all
,
but
only
the
sky
and
the
river
and
the
Eternal
God
be
in
my
soul
.
<EOS>
and
what
be
it
whether
I
die
or
live
?
<EOS>
if
I
lie
down
to
die
in
the
river
,
be
it
more
than
lie
down
to
sleep
?
 
<EOS>
for
there
too
I
commit
my
soul
 
<EOS>
I
give
myself
up
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
memory
any
more
;
I
could
only
feel
what
be
present
in
me
 
<EOS>
it
be
all
one
longing
to
cease
from
my
weary
life
,
which
seem
only
a
pain
outside
the
great
peace
that
I
may
enter
into
.
<EOS>
that
be
how
it
be
.
<EOS>
when
the
evening
come
and
the
sun
be
go
<EOS>
,
it
seem
as
if
that
be
all
I
have
to
wait
for
.
<EOS>
and
a
new
strength
come
into
me
to
will
what
I
would
do
.
<EOS>
You
know
what
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
die
.
<EOS>
You
know
what
happen
 
do
he
not
tell
you
?
<EOS>
faith
come
to
me
again
;
I
be
not
forsake
.
<EOS>
He
tell
you
how
he
find
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
give
no
audible
answer
,
but
press
her
lip
against
Mirah

She

just
a

the

be
the
fervid
little
woman
's
closing
commentary
when
,
_
tete
-

tete

with
Deronda
in
the
back
parlor
that
evening
,
she
have
convey
Mirah
's
story
to
him
with
much
vividness
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
your
feeling
about
a
search
for
this
mother
?
"
say
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
you
no
fear
?
<EOS>
I
have
,
I
confess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
believe
the
mother
's
good
,
"
say
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
with
rapid
decisiveness
;
"
or
_
be
_
good
.
<EOS>
She
may
be
dead
 
<EOS>
that
be
my
fear
.
<EOS>
a
good
woman
,
you
may
depend
:
you
may
know
it
by
the
scoundrel
the
father
be
.
<EOS>
where
do
the
child
get
her
goodness
from
?
<EOS>
wheaten
flour
have
to
be
account
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
be
rather
disappointed
at
this
answer
;
he
have
want
a
confirmation
of
his
own
judgment
,
and
he
begin
to
put
in
demurrer
.
<EOS>
the
argument
about
the
mother
would
not
apply
to
the
brother
;
and
Mrs.
Meyrick
admit
that
the
brother
may
be
an
ugly
likeness
of
the
father
.
<EOS>
then
,
as
to
advertising
,
if
the
name
be
Cohen
,
you
may
as
well
advertise
for
two
undescribed
terrier
;
and
here
Mrs.
Meyrick
help
him
,
for
the
idea
of
an
advertisement
,
already
mention
to
Mirah
,
have
rouse
the
poor
child
's
terror
;
she
be
convince
that
her
father
would
see
it
 
<EOS>
he
see
everything
in
the
paper
.
<EOS>
certainly
there
be
safe
mean
than
advertising
;
man
may
be
set
to
work
whose
business
it
be
to
find
missing
person
;
but
Deronda
wish
Mrs.
Meyrick
to
feel
with
him
that
it
would
be
wise
to
wait
,
before
seek
a
dubious
 
perhaps
a
deplorable
result
;
especially
as
he
be
engage
to
go
abroad
the
next
week
for
a
couple
of
month
.
<EOS>
if
a
search
be
make
,
he
would
like
to
be
at
hand
,
so
that
Mrs.
Meyrick
may
not
be
unaide
in
meet
any
consequence
 
<EOS>
suppose
that
she
would
generously
continue
to
watch
over
Mirah
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
should
be
very
jealous
of
any
one
who
take
the
task
from
us
,
"
say
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
"
She
will
stay
under
my
roof
;
there
be
Hans
's
old
room
for
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
she
be
content
to
wait
?
"
say
Deronda
,
anxiously
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
trouble
there
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
her
nature
to
run
into
planning
and
devising
:
only
to
submit
.
<EOS>
see
how
she
submit
to
that
father
!
<EOS>
It
be
a
wonder
to
herself
how
she
find
the
will
and
contrivance
to
run

about
find
her
mother

her
only
notion
now
be
to
trust

since
you

send

her

we
be
good
to
her

she
trust
that
her
mother
will
be
find
in

unsought
way

<EOS>
and
when
she
be
talk
I
catch
her
feeling
like

<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
hope
that
the
sum
Deronda
put
into
her
hand
as
a
provision
for
Mirah
's
want
be
more
than
would
be
need
;
after
a
little
while
Mirah
would
perhaps
like
to
occupy
herself
as
the
other
girl
do
,
and
make
herself
independent
.
<EOS>
Deronda
plead
that
she
must
need
a
long
rest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
;
we
will
hurry
nothing
,
"
say
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
  
<EOS>
"
rely
upon
it
,
she
shall
be
take
tender
care
of
.
<EOS>
if
you
like
to
give
me
your
address
abroad
,
I
will
write
to
let
you
know
how
we
get
on
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
fair
that
we
should
have
all
the
pleasure
of
her
salvation
to
ourselves
.
<EOS>
and
besides
,
I
want
to
make
believe
that
I
be
do
something
for
you
as
well
as
for
Mirah
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
no
make
-
believe

<EOS>
what
should
I
have
do
without
you
last
night
?
<EOS>
everything
would
have
go
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
shall
tell
Hans
that
the
good
of
have
him
for
a
friend
be
,
know
his
mother
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
that
they
join
the
girl
in
the
other
room
,
where
Mirah
be
seat
placidly
,
while
the
other
be
tell
her
what
they
know
about
Mr.
Deronda
 
his
goodness
to
Hans
,
and
all
the
virtue
that
Hans
have
report
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Kate
burn
a
pastille
before
his
portrait
every
day
,
"
say
Mab

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
carry
his
signature
in
a
little
black
-
silk
bag
<EOS>
round
my
neck
to
keep
off
the
cramp
.
<EOS>
and
Amy
say
the
multiplication

table
in
his
name
.
<EOS>
We
must
all
do
something
extra
in
honor
of
him
,
now
he
have
bring
you
to
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
be
too
great
a
person
to
want
anything
,
"
say
Mirah
,
smile
at
Mab
,
and
appeal
to
the
graver
Amy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
perhaps
very
high
in

world
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
very
much
above
us
in
rank
,
"
say
Amy
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
relate
to
grand
people
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
lean
on
some
of
the
satin
cushion
we
prick
our
finger
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
he
be
of
high
rank
,
"
say
Mirah
,
with
her
usual
quietness
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
why
be
you
glad
of
that
?
"
say
Amy
,
rather
suspicious
of
this
sentiment
,
and
on
the
watch
for
jewish
peculiarity
which
have
not
appear
.
  
<EOS>
"
because
I
have
always
dislike
man
of
high
rank
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mr.
Deronda
be
not
so
very
high
,
"
say
Kate
,
"
He
nee
not
hinder
us
from
think
ill
of
the
whole
peerage
and
baronetage
if
we
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
he
enter
,
Mirah
rise
with
the
same
look
of
grateful
reverence
that
she
have
lift
to
him
the
evening
before
:
impossible
to
see
a
creature
free
at
once
from
embarrassment
and
boldness
.
<EOS>
Her
theatrical
training
have
leave
no
recognizable
trace
;
probably
her
manner
have
not
much
change
since
she
play
the
forsaken
child
at
nine
year
of
age
;
and
she
have
grow
up
in
her
simplicity
and
truthfulness
like
a
little
flower
-
seed
that
absorb
the
chance
confusion
of
its
surround
into
its
own
definite
mould
of
beauty
.
<EOS>
Deronda
feel
that
he
be
make
acquaintance
with
something
quite
new
to
him
in
the
form
of
womanhood
.
<EOS>
for
Mirah
be
not
childlike
from
ignorance
:
her
experience
of
evil
and
trouble
be
deep
and
strange
than
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
feel
inclined
to
watch
her
and
listen
to
her
as
if
she
have
come
from
a
far
off
shore
inhabit
by
a
race
different
from
our
own
.
  
<EOS>
but
for
that
very
reason
he
make
his
visit
brief
with
his
usual
activity
of
imagination
as
to
how
his
conduct
may
affect
other
,
he
shrink
from
what
may
seem
like
curiosity
or
the
assumption
of
a
right
to
know
as
much
as
he
please
of
one
to
whom
he
have
do
a
service
.
<EOS>
for
example
,
he
would
have
like
to
hear
her
sing
,
but
he
would
have
feel
the
expression
of
such
a
wish
to
be
rudeness
in
him
 
since
she
could
not
refuse
,
and
he
would
all
the
while
have
a
sense
that
she
be
be
treat
like
one
whose
accomplishment
be
to
be
ready
on
demand
.
<EOS>
and
whatever
reverence
could
be
show
to
woman
,
he
be
bent
on
show
to
this
girl
.
<EOS>
why
?
<EOS>
He
give
himself
several
good
reason
;
but
whatever
one
do
with
a
strong
unhesitating
outflow
of
will
have
a
store
of
motive
that
it
would
be
hard
to
put
into
word
.
<EOS>
some
deed
seem
little
more
than
interjection
which
give
vent
to
the
long
passion
of
a
life
.
  
<EOS>
so
Deronda
soon
take
his
farewell
for
the
two
month
during
which
he
expect
to
be
absent
from
London
,
and
in
a
few
day
he
be
on
his
way
with
Sir
Hugo
and
Lady
Mallinger
to
Leubronn
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
fulfil
his
intention
of
tell
them
about
Mirah
.
<EOS>
the
baronet
be
decidedly
of
opinion
that
the
search
for
the
mother
and
brother
have
better
be
let
alone
.
<EOS>
Lady
Mallinger
be
much
interested
in
the
poor
girl
,
observe
that
there
be
a
society
for
the
conversion
of
the
Jews
,
and
that
it
be
to
be
hope
Mirah
would
embrace
Christianity
;
but
perceive
that
Sir
Hugo
look
at
her
with
amusement
,
she
conclude
that
she
have
say
something
foolish
.
<EOS>
Lady
Mallinger
feel
apologetically
about
herself
as
a
woman
who
have
produce
nothing
but
daughter
in
a
case
where
son
be
require
,
and
hence
regard
the
apparent
contradiction
of
the
world
as
probably
due
to
the
weakness
of
her
own
understanding
.
<EOS>
but
when
she
be
much
puzzle
,
it
be
her
habit
to
say
to
herself
,
"
I
will
ask
Daniel
.
<EOS>
"
Deronda
be
altogether
a
convenience
in
the
family
;
and
Sir
Hugo
too
,
after
intend
to
do
the
good
for
him
,
have
begin
to
feel
that
the
pleasantest
result
would
be
to
have
this
substitute
for
a
son
always
ready
at
his
elbow
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
history
of
Deronda
,
so
far
as
he
know
it
,
up
to
the
time
of
that
visit
to
Leubronn
in
which
he
see
Gwendolen
Harleth
at
the
gaming

<EOS>
It
be
a
common
sentence
that
Knowledge
be

but
who
hath
duly
    
Considered

<EOS>
of

Knowledge

it
be
a
power
rein
by
scruple

have
a
    
conscience
of
what
must

what
may

whereas
ignorance

a
    
blind
giant

and
turn
all

dark
as

<EOS>
and
look
    
at
life
parcel

in

It
be
half

after

<EOS>
she

a

and
in
her
impatience

at
a
London
station
she
have
set
off
without

what
it
would
be
to
arrive
unannounced
at
half
an

from

Gwendolen
feel
that
the
dirty
paint
in
the
waiting

room
,
the
dusty
decanter
of
flat
water
,
and
the
text
in
large
letter
call
on
her
to
repent
and
be
convert
,
be
part
of
the
dreary
prospect
open
by
her
family
trouble

and
she
hurry
away
to
the
outer
door
look
toward
the
lane
and
field
.
<EOS>
but
here
the
very
gleam
of
sunshine
seem
melancholy
,
for
the
autumnal
leave
and
grass
be
shiver

and
the
wind

turn
up
the

the

and
his

Gwendolen

especially
since

be
a

man

he
do
not

must
conclude
that
she
be
not
very
high
in

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
contemptible

the

<EOS>
even

drop
solitary
at
an
ugly

irrelevant

look
spot
,
with
a
sense
of
no

may
well
prompt
a
man
to
discourage
speculation
on
the
origin
of
thing
and
the
reason
of
a
world
where
a
subtle
thinker
find
himself
so
badly
off

<EOS>
how
much
more
may
such
trifle
tell
on
a
young
lady
equip
for
society
with
a
fastidious
taste
,
an
indian
shawl
over
her
arm
,
some
twenty
cubic
foot

mortal
dislike

the

consciousness
of
poverty
which

stimulate
her
imagination

disagreeable
?
<EOS>
at
any
rate
they
tell
heavily
on
poor
Gwendolen

help

quell

<EOS>
what
be
the
good
of
live
in
the
midst
of
hardship
,
ugliness
,
and
humiliation
?
<EOS>
this
be
the
beginning
of
be
at
home
again
,
and
it
be
a
sample
of
what
she
have
to
expect
.
  
<EOS>
here
be
the
theme
on
which
her
discontent
ring
its
sad
change
during
her
slow
drive
in
the
uneasy
barouche

with
one
great
trunk
squeeze
the
meek
driver
,
and
the
other
fasten
with
a
rope
on
the
seat
in

of
her

<EOS>
Her
ruling
vision
all
the
way
from
Leubronn
have
be
that
the
family
would
go
abroad
again
;
for
of
course
there
must
be
some
little
income
leave
 
her
mamma
do
not

they
would
have
literally
nothing

<EOS>
to
go
to
a
dull
place
abroad
and
live
poorly
,
be
the
dismal
future
that
threaten
her

she
have
see
plenty
of
poor
english
people
abroad
and
imagine
herself
plunge
in
the
despised
dullness
of
their
ill

plenishe
life

with
Alice

Bertha

Fanny

Isabel
all
grow
up
in
tediousness
around
her

while
she
advance
toward
thirty
and
her
mamma
get
more
and
more
melancholy

<EOS>
but
she
do
not
mean
to
submit
,
and
let
misfortune
do
what
it
would
with
her
:
she
have
not
yet
quite
believe
in
the
misfortune
;
but
weariness
and
disgust
with
this
wretched
arrival
have
begin
to
affect
her
like
an
uncomfortable
waking
,
bad
than
the
uneasy
dream
which
have
go
before

<EOS>
the
self
-
delight
with
which
she
have
kiss
her
image
in
the

have
fade
before
the
sense

in

anything
whatever
 
charming

<EOS>
what
be
the

of
it
all

event
may

out
anyhow

man
be
hateful

<EOS>
yes
,
man
be
hateful

<EOS>
but
in
these
last
hour
,
a
certain
change
have
come
over
their
meaning

<EOS>
It
be
one
thing
to
hate
steal
good
,
and
another
thing
to
hate
them
the
more
because
their
be
steal
hinder

<EOS>
Gwendolen
have
begin
to
be
angry
with
Grandcourt
for

hinder
her
from

him

angry
with
him
as
the
cause

her
present
dreary

<EOS>
a

bring
a
rush

new

carriage
she

the

beautiful
face
with
fresh
line

sadness
in
it
<EOS>

she
throw
her

round

her

feeling

behind

feel
Gwendolen

presence
to
be
somehow
a
relenting
of
misfortune
:
where
Gwendolen
be
,
something
interesting
would
happen
;
even
her
hurried
submission
to
their
kiss
,
and
"
now
go
away

the

Good
Miss

unaccountable
in

affectionately
attach
to
the

be
now
at
the
general
level
of
circumstance
,
do
not
expect
any
greeting
,
but
busy
herself
with
the
trunk
and
the
coachman
's
pay
;
while
Mrs.
Davilow
and
Gwendolen
hasten
up

stair
and
shut
themselves
in
the
black
and
yellow
bedroom

<EOS>
"

Gwendolen

Gwendolen

speech

<EOS>
a
rush
of
compassionate
tenderness
stir
all
her
capability
of
generous
resolution
;
and
the
self

confident
project
which
have
vaguely
glance
before
her
during
her
journey
spring
instantaneously
into
new
definiteness

<EOS>
suddenly
she
seem
to
perceive
how
she
could
be

something

It
be
one
of

good
moment

at

of
adoration

She

I
can
be
happy

if
you

<EOS>
but
later
in
the
day
there
be
an
ebb
;
the
old
slippery
rock
,
the
old
weedy
place
reappear
.
<EOS>
naturally
,
there
be
a
shrinking
of
courage
as
misfortune
cease
to
be
a
mere
announcement
,
and
begin
to
disclose
itself
as
a
grievous
tyrannical
inmate
.
<EOS>
at
first
 
that
ugly
drive
at
an
end
 
<EOS>
it
be
still
offendene
that
Gwendolen
have
come
home
to
,
and
all
surrounding
of
immediate
consequence
to
her
be
still
there
to
secure
her
personal
ease
;
the
roomy
stillness
of
the
large
solid
house
while
she
rest
;
all
the
luxury
of
her
toilet
care
for
without
trouble
to
her

and
a
little
tray
with
her
favorite
food
bring
to

she
have
say
,
"

<EOS>
when
Gwendolen
come
down
into

fresh
as

sit
lean
against

She

tone
of
deliberate

<EOS>

put

Gwendolen

with

She
feel

Mrs.

She
dread
the

silent

at
first

Gwendolen
remain
silent

pale
with
anger
 
justifiable
anger

in

opinion

then
she
say
with
haughtiness
    
<EOS>

something

My

<EOS>
Your

I

be
as
kind

he

he
be
suffer
himself

he
have
his

do

You

alas

superstition

well

<EOS>

surely
somewhere

You

the
ebb

sympathetic

go

low

an

impetuously

poor
Mrs.

startle
by
this
revelation
of
the
gambling

not

more

She
feel
sure

Gwendolen
answer
immediately

I
do

do
what
I

what
be

Providence

You

in

it

Mr.

fault
we

have
he
run
away

<EOS>
"
no

<EOS>
dear

you
do
not
understand

<EOS>
there
be
great
speculation
:
he
mean
to
gain

<EOS>
It
be
all
about
mine

<EOS>
He
risk
too
much

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
call
that
Providence

it
be
his
improvidence
with

he
ought
to
be
punish
.
<EOS>
can
not
we
go
to
law

recover
our

<EOS>
My

measure

My

law
can
never

Your

it
be
milk
spill
upon

ground

besides

one
must
have
a
fortune
to
get
any
law

there
be
no
law
for

ruin

our

have
only
go
along
with
other

sufferer

other

I
do
not

<EOS>
some
of
Gwendolen
's
anger
give
way
to
interest

and
she
be
not
without
romantic
conjecture
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
two
situation
that
offer
themselves
.
<EOS>
one
be
in
a
bishop
's
family
,
where
there
be
three
daughter
,
and
the
other
be
in
quite
a
high
class
of
school
;
and
in
both
,
your
French
,
and
music
,
and
dance
 
and
then
your
manner
and
habit
as
a
lady
,
be
exactly
what
be
want
.
<EOS>
each
be
a
hundred
a
year
 
and
 
just
for
the
present
,
"
 
Mrs.
Davilow
have
become
frightened
and
hesitating
,
 
"
to
save
you
from
the
petty
,
common
way
of
living
that
we
must
go
to
 
<EOS>
you
would
perhaps
accept
one
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
be
like
Miss
Graves
at
Madame
Meunier
<EOS>
's
?
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
myself
,
that
Dr.
Monpert
's
would
be
more
suitable
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
hardship
in
a
bishop
's
family
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
excuse
me
,
mamma

<EOS>
there
be
hardship
everywhere
for
a
governess

and
I
do
not
see
that
it
would
be
pleasanter
to
be
look
down
on
in
a
bishop
's
family
than
in
any
other
.
<EOS>
besides
,
you
know
very
well
I
hate
teach
.
<EOS>
fancy
me
shut
up
with
three
awkward
girl
something
like
Alice
!
<EOS>
I
would
rather
emigrate
than
be
a
governess
.
"
  
<EOS>
what
it
precisely
be
to
emigrate
,
Gwendolen
be
not
call
on
to
explain
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
be
mute
,
see
no
outlet
,
and
think
with
dread
of
the
collision
that
may
happen
when
Gwendolen
have
to
meet
her
uncle
and
aunt
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
air
of
reticence
in
Gwendolen
's
haughty
,
resistant
speech
which
imply
that
she
have
a
definite
plan
in
reserve
;
and
her
practical
ignorance
continually
exhibit
,
could
not
nullify
the
mother
's
belief
in
the
effectiveness
of
that
forcible
will
and
daring
which
have
hold
mastery
over
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
some
ornament
,
mamma
,
and
I
could
sell
them
,
"
say
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
They
would
make
a
sum
:
I
want
a
little
sum
 
just
to
go
on
with
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
Marshall
,
at
Wanchester
,
would
take
them
:
<EOS>
I
know
he
show
me
some
bracelet
once
that
he
say
he
have
buy
from
a
lady

<EOS>
Jocosa
may
go
and
ask
him
.
<EOS>
Jocosa
be
go
to
leave
us
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
but
she
may
do
that
first
.
<EOS>

<EOS>

She
would
do
anything
she
could

poor

dear
soul

<EOS>
I
have
not
tell
you
yet

she
want
me
to
take
all
her
saving
 
<EOS>
her
three
hundred
pound

I
tell
her
to
set

It
will
be
hard
for
her
to
go
into
a
new

<EOS>
now
she
have
be
so
long
with
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
recommend
her
for
the
bishop
's
daughter

Gwendolen
,
with
a
sudden
gleam
of
laughter
in
her
face

<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
she
will
do
better
than
I
should

<EOS>

"
do
take
care
not
to
say
such
thing
to
your

Mrs.

<EOS>
"
He
will
be
hurt
at
your
despising
what
he
have
exert
himself
about

<EOS>
but
I
dare
say
you
have
something
else
in
your
mind
that
he
may
not
disapprove
,
if
you
consult
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
some
one
else
I
want
to
consult
first

<EOS>
be
the
Arrowpoint

at
Quetcham
still
,
and
be
Herr
Klesmer
there

<EOS>
but
I
daresay
you
know
nothing
about
it
,
poor

dear
mamma

Can
jeffrie
go
on
horseback
with
a

oh
,
my
dear

Jefferies
be
not
here
,

the

have
take
the

some

the
Arrowpoints

I
know

<EOS>
Miss
Arrowpoint
leave
her
card
the
other
day
:
I
could
not
see
her
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
know
about
Herr
Klesmer
.
<EOS>
do
you
want
to
send
before
to

morrow
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
,
as
soon
as
possible

<EOS>
I
will
write
a
note
,

Gwendolen
,
rise

<EOS>
"
what
can
you

of

say
Mrs.

relieve
in
the

of
her
wonderment
by
sign

Gwendolen
,
hold
her
mamma

head
with
both

kiss
the

"
<EOS>
but
mind
you
do
not
contradict
me

put
hindrance
in

<EOS>
I
must
decide
for
myself

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
My

I
think
"
 
here
her
tone
take
an
edge
of
scorn
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
can
do
better
for
you
than
let
you

"
  
<EOS>
in
utter
this
last
sentence
Gwendolen
again
rise
,
and
go
to
a
desk
where
she
write
the
follow
note
to
Klesmer
:
        
<EOS>
Miss
Harleth
present
her
compliment
to
Herr
Klesmer
,
and
venture
    
to
request
of
him
the
very
great
favor
that
he
will
call
upon
her
,
if
    
possible
,
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Her
reason
for
presume
so
far
on
his
kindness
    
be
of
a
very
serious
nature
.
<EOS>
unfortunate
family
circumstance
have
    
oblige
her
to
take
a
course
in
which
she
can
only
turn
for
advice
to
    
the
great
knowledge
and
judgment
of
Herr
Klesmer
.
  
<EOS>
"
pray
get
this
sent
to
Quetcham
at
once
,
mamma
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
as
she
address
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
the
man
must
be
tell
to
wait
for
an
answer
.
<EOS>
let
no
time
be
lose
.
"
  
<EOS>
for
the
moment
,
the
absorb
purpose
be
to
get
the
letter
dispatch
;
but
when
she
have
be
assure
on
this
point
,
another
anxiety
arise
and
keep
her
in
a
state
of
uneasy
excitement
.
<EOS>
if
Klesmer
happen
not
to
be
at
Quetcham
,
what
could
she
do
next
?
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
belief
in
her
star
,
so
to
speak
,
have
have
some
bruise
.
<EOS>
thing
have
go
against
her
.
<EOS>
a
splendid
marriage
which
present
itself
within
reach
have
show
a
hideous
flaw
.
<EOS>
the
chance
of
roulette
have
not
adjust
themselves
to
her
claim
;
and
a
man
of
whom
she
know
nothing
have
thrust
himself
between
her
and
her
intention
.
<EOS>
the
conduct
of
those
uninteresting
people
who
manage
the
business
of
the
world
have
be
culpable
just
in
the
point
most
injurious
to
her
in
particular
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
Harleth
,
with
all
her
beauty
and
conscious
force
,
feel
the
close
threat
of
humiliation
:
for
the
first
time
the
condition
of
this
world
seem
to
her
like
a
hurrying
roar
crowd
in
which
she
have
get
astray
,
no
more
cared
for
and
protect
than
a
myriad
of
other
girl
,
in
spite
of
its
be
a
peculiar
hardship
to
her
.
<EOS>
if
Klesmer
be
not
at
Quetcham
 
that
would
be
all
of
a
piece
with
the
rest
:
the
unwelcome
negative
urge
itself
as
a
probability
,
and
set
her
brain
work
at
desperate
alternative
which
may
deliver
her
from
Sawyer
's
Cottage
or
the
ultimate
necessity
of
"
take
a
situation
,
"
a
phrase
that
sum
up
for
her
the
disagreeable
most
wound
to
her
pride
,
most
irksome
to
her
taste
;
at
least
so
far
as
her
experience
enable
her
to
imagine
disagreeable
.
  
<EOS>
still
Klesmer
may
be
there
,
and
Gwendolen
think
of
the
result
in
that
case
with
a
hopefulness
which
even
cast
a
satisfactory
light
over
her
peculiar
trouble
,
as
what
may
well
enter
into
the
biography
of
celebrity
and
remarkable
person
.
<EOS>
and
if
she
have
hear
her
immediate
acquaintance
cross
-
examine
as
to
whether
they
think
her
remarkable
,
the
first
who
say
"
no
"
would
have
surprise
her
.
      
<EOS>
We
please
our
fancy
with
ideal
webs
  
<EOS>
of
innovation
,
but
our
life
meanwhile
  
be
in
the
loom
,
where
busy
passion
ply
  
the
shuttle
to
and
fro
,
and
give
our
deed
  
the
accustomed
pattern
.
   
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
note
,
come
"
pat
betwixt
too
early
and
too
late
,
"
be
put
into
Klesmer
's
hand
just
when
he
be
leave
Quetcham
,
and
in
order
to
meet
her
appeal
to
his
kindness
he
,
with
some
inconvenience
to
himself
spend
the
night
at
Wanchester
.
<EOS>
there
be
reason
why
he
would
not
remain
at
Quetcham
.
  
<EOS>
that
magnificent
mansion
,
fit
with
regard
to
the
great
expense
,
have
in
fact
become
too
hot
for
him
,
its
owner
have
,
like
some
great
politician
,
be
astonish
at
an
insurrection
against
the
established
order
of
thing
,
which
we
plain
people
after
the
event
can
perceive
to
have
be
prepare
under
their
very
nose
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
as
usual
many
guest
in
the
house
,
and
among
them
one
in
whom
Miss
Arrowpoint
foresee
a
new
pretender
to
her
hand
:
a
political
man
of
good
family
who
confidently
expect
a
peerage
,
and
feel
on
public
ground
that
he
require
a
large
fortune
to
support
the
title
properly
.
<EOS>
heiress
vary
,
and
person
interested
in
one
of
them
beforehand
be
prepared
to
find
that
she
be
too
yellow
or
too
red
,
tall
and
toppling
or
short
and
square
,
violent
and
capricious
or
moony
and
insipid
;
but
in
every
case
it
be
take
for
grant
that
she
will
consider
herself
an
appendage
to
her
fortune
,
and
marry
where
other
think
her
fortune
ought
to
go
.
<EOS>
nature
,
however
,
not
only
accommodate
herself
ill
to
our
favorite
practice
by
make
"
only
child
"
daughter
,
but
also
now
and
then
endow
the
misplaced
daughter
with
a
clear
head
and
a
strong
will
.
<EOS>
the
Arrowpoints
have
already
feel
some
anxiety
owe
to
these
endowment
of
their
Catherine
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
accept
the
view
of
her
social
duty
which
require
her
to
marry
a
needy
nobleman
or
a
commoner
on
the
ladder
toward
nobility
;
and
they
be
not
without
uneasiness
concern
her
persistence
in
decline
suitable
offer
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
possibility
of
her
be
in
love
with
Klesmer
they
be
not
at
all
uneasy
 
a
very
common
sort
of
blindness
.
<EOS>
for
in
general
mortal
have
a
great
power
of
be
astonish
at
the
presence
of
an
effect
toward
which
they
have
do
everything
,
and
at
the
absence
of
an
effect
toward
which
they
have
do
nothing
but
desire
it
.
<EOS>
parent
be
astonish
at
the
ignorance
of
their
son
,
though
they
have
use
the
most
time
-
honor
and
expensive
mean
of
secure
it
;
husband
and
wife
be
mutually
astonished
at
the
loss
of
affection
which
they
have
take
no
pain
to
keep
;
and
all
of
us
in
our
turn
be
apt
to
be
astonish
that
our
neighbor
do
not
admire
us
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
it
happen
that
the
truth
seem
highly
improbable
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
something
different
from
the
habitual
lazy
combination
begotten
by
our
wish
.
<EOS>
the
Arrowpoints
'
hour
of
astonishment
be
come
.
  
<EOS>
when
there
be
a
passion
between
an
heiress
and
a
proud
independent
-
spirited
man
,
it
be
difficult
for
them
to
come
to
an
understanding
;
but
the
difficulty
be
likely
to
be
overcome
unless
the
proud
man
secure
himself
by
a
constant
_
alibi
_
.
<EOS>
brief
meeting
after
study
absence
be
potent
in
disclosure
:
but
more
potent
still
be
frequent
companionship
,
with
full
sympathy
in
taste
and
admirable
quality
on
both
side
;
especially
where
the
one
be
in
the
position
of
teacher
and
the
other
be
delightedly
conscious
of
receptive
ability
which
also
give
the
teacher
delight
.
<EOS>
the
situation
be
famous
in
history
,
and
have
no
less
charm
now
than
it
have
in
the
day
of
Abelard
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
kind
of
comparison
have
not
occur
to
the
Arrowpoints
when
they
first
engage
Klesmer
to
come
down
to
Quetcham
.
<EOS>
to
have
a
first
-
rate
musician
in
your
house
be
a
privilege
of
wealth
;
Catherine
's
musical
talent
demand
every
advantage
;
and
she
particularly
desire
to
use
her
quieter
time
in
the
country
for
more
thorough
study
.
<EOS>
Klesmer
be
not
yet
a
Liszt
,
understand
to
be
adore
by
lady
of
all
european
country
with
the
exception
of
lapland
:
and
even
with
that
understanding
it
do
not
follow
that
he
would
make
proposal
to
an
heiress
.
<EOS>
no
musician
of
honor
would
do
so
.
<EOS>
still
less
be
it
conceivable
that
Catherine
would
give
him
the
slight
pretext
for
such
daring
.
<EOS>
the
large
check
that
Mr.
Arrowpoint
be
to
draw
in
Klesmer
's
name
seem
to
make
him
as
safe
an
inmate
as
a
footman
.
<EOS>
where
marriage
be
inconceivable
,
a
girl
's
sentiment
be
safe
.
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
be
eminently
a
man
of
honor
,
but
marriage
rarely
begin
with
formal
proposal
,
and
moreover
,
Catherine
's
limit
of
the
conceivable
do
not
exactly
correspond
with
her
mother
's
.
  
<EOS>
outsider
may
have
be
more
apt
to
think
that
Klesmer
's
position
be
dangerous
for
himself
if
Miss
Arrowpoint
have
be
an
acknowledge
beauty
;
not
take
into
account
that
the
most
powerful
of
all
beauty
be
that
which
reveal
itself
after
sympathy
and
not
before
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
charm
of
eye
and
lip
which
come
with
every
little
phrase
that
certify
delicate
perception
or
fine
judgment
,
with
every
unostentatious
word
or
smile
that
show
a
heart
awake
to
other
;
and
no
sweep
of
garment
or
turn
of
figure
be
more
satisfying
than
that
which
enter
as
a
restoration
of
confidence
that
one
person
be
present
on
whom
no
intention
will
be
lose
.
<EOS>
what
dignity
of
meaning
go
on
gathering
in
frown
and
laugh
which
be
never
observe
in
the
wrong
place
;
what
suffuse
adorableness
in
a
human
frame
where
there
be
a
mind
that
can
flash
out
comprehension
and
hand
that
can
execute
finely
!
<EOS>
the
more
obvious
beauty
,
also
adorable
sometimes
 
one
may
say
it
without
blasphemy
 
begin
by
be
an
apology
for
folly
,
and
end
like
other
apology
in
become
tiresome
by
iteration
;
and
that
Klesmer
,
though
very
susceptible
to
it
,
should
have
a
passionate
attachment
to
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
be
no
more
a
paradox
than
any
other
triumph
of
a
manifold
sympathy
over
a
monotonous
attraction
.
<EOS>
We
object
less
to
be
tax
with
the
enslave
excess
of
our
passion
than
with
our
deficiency
in
wide
passion
;
but
if
the
truth
be
know
,
our
reputed
intensity
be
often
the
dullness
of
not
know
what
else
to
do
with
ourselves
.
<EOS>
tannhäuser
,
one
suspect
,
be
a
knight
of
ill
-
furnish
imagination
,
hardly
of
large
discourse
than
a
heavy
Guardsman
;
Merlin
have
certainly
see
his
good
day
,
and
be
merely
repeat
himself
,
when
he
fall
into
that
hopeless
captivity
;
and
we
know
that
Ulysses
feel
so
manifest
an
_
ennui
_
under
similar
circumstance
that
Calypso
herself
further
his
departure
.
<EOS>
there
be
indeed
a
report
that
he
afterward
leave
Penelope
;
but
since
she
be
habitually
absorb
in
worst
work
,
and
it
be
probably
from
her
that
Telemachus
get
his
mean
,
pettifog
disposition
,
always
anxious
about
the
property
and
the
daily
consumption
of
meat
,
no
inference
can
be
draw
from
this
already
dubious
scandal
as
to
the
relation
between
companionship
and
constancy
.
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
be
as
versatile
and
fascinating
as
a
young
ulysse
on
a
sufficient
acquaintance
 
one
whom
nature
seem
to
have
first
make
generously
and
then
to
have
add
music
as
a
dominant
power
use
all
the
abundant
rest
,
and
,
as
in
Mendelssohn
,
find
expression
for
itself
not
only
in
the
high
finish
of
execution
,
but
in
that
fervor
of
creative
work
and
theoretic
belief
which
pierce
devoted
purpose
.
<EOS>
His
foible
of
arrogance
and
vanity
do
not
exceed
such
as
may
be
find
in
the
good
english
family
;
and
Catherine
Arrowpoint
have
no
correspond
restlessness
to
clash
with
his
:
notwithstanding
her
native
kindliness
she
be
perhaps
too
coolly
firm
and
self
-
sustained
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
one
of
those
satisfactory
creature
whose
intercourse
have
the
charm
of
discovery
;
whose
integrity
of
faculty
and
expression
beget
a
wish
to
know
what
they
will
say
on
all
subject
or
how
they
will
perform
whatever
they
undertake
;
so
that
they
end
by
raise
not
only
a
continual
expectation
but
a
continual
sense
of
fulfillment
 
the
systole
and
diastole
of
blissful
companionship
.
<EOS>
in
such
case
the
outward
presentment
easily
become
what
the
image
be
to
the
worshipper
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
before
the
two
become
aware
that
each
be
interesting
to
the
other
;
but
the
"
how
far
"
remain
a
matter
of
doubt
.
<EOS>
Klesmer
do
not
conceive
that
Miss
Arrowpoint
be
likely
to
think
of
him
as
a
possible
lover
,
and
she
be
not
accustom
to
think
of
herself
as
likely
to
stir
more
than
a
friendly
regard
,
or
to
fear
the
expression
of
more
from
any
man
who
be
not
enamor
of
her
fortune
.
<EOS>
each
be
content
to
suffer
some
unshared
sense
of
denial
for
the
sake
of
love
the
other
's
society
a
little
too
well
;
and
under
these
condition
no
need
have
be
feel
to
restrict
Klesmer
's
visit
for
the
last
year
either
in
country
or
in
town
.
<EOS>
He
know
very
well
that
if
Miss
Arrowpoint
have
be
poor
he
would
have
make
ardent
love
to
her
instead
of
send
a
storm
through
the
piano
,
or
fold
his
arm
and
pour
out
a
hyperbolical
tirade
about
something
as
impersonal
as
the
north
pole
;
and
she
be
not
less
aware
that
if
it
have
be
possible
for
Klesmer
to
wish
for
her
hand
she
would
have
find
overmaster
reason
for
give
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
here
be
the
safety
of
full
cup
,
which
be
as
secure
from
overflow
as
the
half
-
empty
,
always
suppose
no
disturbance
.
<EOS>
naturally
,
silent
feeling
have
not
remain
at
the
same
point
any
more
than
the
stealthly
dial
-
hand
,
and
in
the
present
visit
to
Quetcham
,
Klesmer
have
begin
to
think
that
he
would
not
come
again
;
while
Catherine
be
more
sensitive
to
his
frequent
_
brusquerie
_
,
which
she
rather
resent
as
a
needless
effort
to
assert
his
footing
of
superior
in
every
sense
except
the
conventional
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
enter
the
expectant
peer
,
Mr.
Bult
,
an
esteemed
party
man
who
,
rather
neutral
in
private
life
,
have
strong
opinion
concern
the
district
of
the
Niger
,
be
much
at
home
also
in
Brazils
,
speak
with
decision
of
affair
in
the
South
Seas
,
be
studious
of
his
Parliamentary
and
itinerant
speech
,
and
have
the
general
solidity
and
suffusive
pinkness
of
a
healthy
Briton
on
the
central
table
-
land
of
life
.
<EOS>
catherine
,
aware
of
a
tacit
understanding
that
he
be
an
undeniable
husband
for
an
heiress
,
have
nothing
to
say
against
him
but
that
he
be
thoroughly
tiresome
to
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bult
be
amiably
confident
,
and
have
no
idea
that
his
insensibility
to
counterpoint
could
ever
be
reckon
against
him
.
<EOS>
Klesmer
he
hardly
regard
in
the
light
of
a
serious
human
being
who
ought
to
have
a
vote
;
and
he
do
not
mind
Miss
Arrowpoint
's
addiction
to
music
any
more
than
her
probable
expense
in
antique
lace
.
<EOS>
He
be
consequently
a
little
amazed
at
an
after
-
dinner
outburst
of
Klesmer
's
on
the
lack
of
idealism
in
english
politic
,
which
leave
all
mutuality
between
distant
race
to
be
determine
simply
by
the
need
of
a
market
;
<EOS>
the
crusade
,
to
his
mind
,
have
at
least
this
excuse
,
that
they
have
a
banner
of
sentiment
round
which
generous
feeling
could
rally
:
of
course
,
the
scoundrel
rally
too
,
but
what
then
?
<EOS>
they
rally
in
equal
force
round
your
advertisement
van
of
"
buy
cheap
,
sell
dear
.
<EOS>
"
on
this
theme
Klesmer
's
eloquence
,
gesticulatory
and
other
,
go
on
for
a
little
while
like
stray
firework
accidentally
ignite
,
and
then
sink
into
immovable
silence
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bult
be
not
surprise
that
Klesmer
's
opinion
should
be
flighty
,
but
be
astonish
at
his
command
of
english
idiom
and
his
ability
to
put
a
point
in
a
way
that
would
have
tell
at
a
constituent
'
dinner
 
to
be
account
for
probably
by
his
be
a
Pole
,
or
a
Czech
,
or
something
of
that
fermenting
sort
,
in
a
state
of
political
refugeeism
which
have
oblige
him
to
make
a
profession
of
his
music
;
and
that
evening
in
the
drawing
-
room
he
for
the
first
time
go
up
to
Klesmer
at
the
piano
,
Miss
Arrowpoint
be
near
,
and
say
    
"
I
have
no
idea
before
that
you
be
a
political
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
's
only
answer
be
to
fold
his
arm
,
put
out
his
nether
lip
,
and
stare
at
Mr.
Bult
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
be
use
to
public
speaking
.
<EOS>
You
speak
uncommonly
well
,
though
I
do
not
agree
with
you

<EOS>
from
what
you
say
about

I
fancy
you

a
Panslavist

<EOS>
"
no

my

<EOS>
I

say
Klesmer
,
flash
a
smile
at
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
and
suddenly
make
a
mysterious
,
wind
-
like
rush
backward
and
forward
on
the
piano
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bult
feel
this
buffoonery
rather
offensive
and
polish
,
but
 
Miss
Arrowpoint
be
there
 
do
not
like
to
move
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Herr
Klesmer
have
cosmopolitan

Miss
Arrowpoint
,

to
make
the
good
of

He
look
forward
to
a
fusion

say
Mr.
Bult
,
willing
to
be
gracious

<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
he
have
too
much
talent
to
be

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah

sir
,
you
be
under
some

Klesmer

up

<EOS>
no

Most

We

rule
the
nation

We

ourselves

"
  
<EOS>
with
the
last
word
Klesmer
wheel
from
the
piano
and
walk
away
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Arrowpoint
color
,
and
Mr.
Bult
observe
,
with
his

phlegmatic
stolidity

"
Your

"
Herr
Klesmer

something
more
than

Miss

apologetically
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
a
great
musician
in
the
full
sense

the
word

<EOS>
He
will
rank
with
Schubert

Mendelssohn

"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
you
lady
understand
these
thing
,
"
say
Mr.
Bult
,
none
the
less
convinced
that
these
thing
be
frivolous
because
Klesmer
have
show
himself
a
coxcomb

<EOS>
Catherine

always
sorry
when
Klesmer
give
himself
air

find
an
opportunity
the
next

,
"
why

heated
last
night

Mr.

He

no

You

Klesmer

rather
fiercely

I

it

You
find
no

you

a
respect

platitudinarian
as
insensible
as
an
ox
to
everything
he
can
not
turn
into

You
think
his

obtuseness
suit

I

now
you
be
slightly
nearer

then
I

pardon

even
you

touch
the

judgment

I

<EOS>
Gwendolen
have
her
way
,
of
course
;
only
that
Miss
Merry
and
two
of
the
girl
stay
at
home
,
to
give
the
house
a
look
of
habitation
by
sit
at
the
dining
-
room
window
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
delicious
Sunday
morning
.
<EOS>
the
melancholy
wane
sunshine
of
autumn
rest
on
the
half
-
strown
grass
and
come
mildly
through
the
window
in
slant
band
of
brightness
over
the
old
furniture
,
and
the
glass
panel
that
reflect
the
furniture
;
over
the
tapestrie
chair
with
their
fade
flower
-
wreath
,
the
dark
enigmatic
picture
,
the
superannuated
organ
at
which
Gwendolen
have
please
herself
with
act
Saint
Cecelia
on
her
first
joyous
arrival
,
the
crowd
of
pallid
,
dusty
knicknack
see
through
the
open
door
of
the
antechamber
where
she
have
achieve
the
wearing
of
her
greek
dress
as
Hermione
.
<EOS>
this
last
memory
be
just
now
very
busy
in
her
;
for
have
not
Klesmer
then
be
strike
with
admiration
of
her
pose
and
expression
?
<EOS>
whatever
he
have
say
,
whatever
she
imagine
him
to
have
think
,
be
at
this
moment
point
with
keen
interest
for
her
:
perhaps
she
have
never
before
in
her
life
feel
so
inwardly
dependent
,
so
consciously
in
need
of
another
person
's
opinion
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
new
fluttering
of
spirit
within
her
,
a
new
element
of
deliberation
in
her
self
-
estimate
which
have
hitherto
be
a
blissful
gift
of
intuition
.
<EOS>
still
it
be
the
recurrent
burden
of
her
inward
soliloquy
that
Klesmer
have
see
but
little
of
her
,
and
any
unfavorable
conclusion
of
his
must
have
too
narrow
a
foundation
.
<EOS>
She
really
feel
clever
enough
for
anything
.
  
<EOS>
to
fill
up
the
time
she
collect
her
volume
and
piece
of
music
,
and
lay
them
on
the
top
of
the
piano
,
set
herself
to
classify
them
.
<EOS>
then
catch
the
reflection
of
her
movement
in
the
glass
panel
,
she
be
divert
to
the
contemplation
of
the
image
there
and
walk
toward
it
.
<EOS>
dress
in
black
,
without
a
single
ornament
,
and
with
the
warm
whiteness
of
her
skin
set
off
between
her
light
-
brown
coronet
of
hair
and
her
square
-
cut
bodice
,
she
may
have
tempt
an
artist
to
try
again
the
roman
trick
of
a
statue
in
black
,
white
,
and
tawny
marble
.
<EOS>
see
her
image
slowly
advance
,
she
think
"
I
_
be
_
beautiful
"
 
not
exultingly
,
but
with
grave
decision
.
<EOS>
be
beautiful
be
after
all
the
condition
on
which
she
most
need
external
testimony
.
<EOS>
if
any
one
object
to
the
turn
of
her
nose
or
the
form
of
her
neck
and
chin
,
she
have
not
the
sense
that
she
could
presently
show
her
power
of
attainment
in
these
branch
of
feminine
perfection
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
not
much
time
to
fill
up
in
this
way
before
the
sound
of
wheel
,
the
loud
ring
,
and
<EOS>
the
opening
door
assure
her
that
she
be
not
by
any
accident
to
be
disappoint
.
<EOS>
this
slightly
increase
her
inward
flutter
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
her
self
-
confidence
,
she
dread
Klesmer
as
part
of
that
unmanageable
world
which
be
independent
of
her
wish
 
<EOS>
something
vitriolic
that
would
not
cease
to
burn
because
you
smile
or
frown
at
it
.
<EOS>
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
she
be
at
a
high
crisis
of
her
woman
's
fate
than
in
her
last
experience
with
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
the
questioning
then
,
be
whether
she
should
take
a
particular
man
as
a
husband
.
<EOS>
the
inmost
fold
of
her
questioning
now
be
whether
she
nee
take
a
husband
at
all
 
whether
she
could
not
achieve
substantially
for
herself
and
know
gratify
ambition
without
bondage
.
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
make
his
most
deferential
bow
in
the
wide
doorway
of
the
antechamber
 
show
also
the
deference
of
the
fine
gray
kerseymere
trouser
and
perfect
glove
(
the
'
master
of
those
who
know
'
be
happily
altogether
human
)
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
meet
him
with
unusual
gravity
,
and
hold
out
her
hand
say
,
"
It
be
most
kind
of
you
to
come
,
Herr
Klesmer
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
not
think
me
presumptuous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
take
your
wish
as
a
command
that
do
me
honor
,
"
say
Klesmer
,
with
answer
gravity
.
<EOS>
He
be
really
put
by
his
own
affair
in
order
to
give
his
utmost
attention
to
what
Gwendolen
may
have
to
say
;
but
his
temperament
be
still
in
a
state
of
excitation
from
the
event
of
yesterday
,
likely
enough
to
give
his
expression
a
more
than
usually
bite
edge
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
for
once
be
under
too
great
a
strain
of
feeling
to
remember
formality
.
<EOS>
She
continue
stand
near
the
piano
,
and
Klesmer
take
his
stand
near
the
other
end
of
it
with
his
back
to
the
light
and
his
terribly
omniscient
eye
upon
her
.
<EOS>
no
affectation
be
of
use
,
and
she
begin
without
delay
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
consult
you
,
Herr
Klesmer
.
<EOS>
We
have
lose
all
our
fortune
;
we
have
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
must
get
my
own
bread
,
and
I
desire
to
provide
for
my
mamma
,
so
as
to
save
her
from
any
hardship
.
<EOS>
the
only
way
I
can
think
of
 
<EOS>
and
I
should
like
it
better
than
anything
 
<EOS>
be
to
be
an
actress
 
to
go
on
the
stage
.
<EOS>
but
,
of
course
,
I
should
like
to
take
a
high
position
,
and
I
think
 
if
you
think
I
could
"
 
here
Gwendolen
become
a
little
more
nervous
 
"
it
would
be
well
for
me
to
be
a
singer
 
to
study
singe
also
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
put
down
his
hat
upon
the
piano
,
and
fold
his
arm
as
if
to
concentrate
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
"
Gwendolen
resume
,
turn
from
pale
to
pink
and
back
again
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
my
method
of
singing
be
very
defective
;
but
I
have
be
ill
taught
.
<EOS>
I
could
be
better
teach
;
I
could
study
.
<EOS>
and
you
will
understand
my
wish
:
 
to
sing
and
act
too
,
like
Grisi
,
be
a
much
high
position
.
<EOS>
naturally
,
I
should
wish
to
take
as
high
rank
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
and
I
can
rely
on
your
judgment
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
will
tell
me
the
truth
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
somehow
have
the
conviction
that
now
she
make
this
serious
appeal
the
truth
would
be
favorable
.
  
<EOS>
still
Klesmer
do
not
speak
.
<EOS>
He
draw
off
his
glove
quickly
,
toss
them
into
his
hat
,
rest
his
hand
on
his
hip
,
and
walk
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
be
fill
with
compassion
for
this
girl
:
he
want
to
put
a
guard
on
his
speech
.
<EOS>
when
he
turn
again
,
he
look
at
her
with
a
mild
frown
of
inquiry
,
and
say
with
gentle
though
quick
utterance
,
"
You
have
never
see
anything
,
I
think
,
of
artist
and
their
life
?
 
<EOS>
I
mean
of
musician
,
actor
,
artist
of
that
kind
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
not
perturb
by
a
reference
to
this
obvious
fact
in
the
history
of
a
young
lady
<EOS>
hitherto
well
provide
for
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
 
pardon
me
,
"
say
Klesmer
,
again
pause
near
the
piano
 
"
in
come
to
a
conclusion
on
such
a
matter
as
this
,
everything
must
be
take
into
consideration
 
<EOS>
you
be
perhaps
twenty
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
twenty
-
one
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
a
slight
fear
rise
in
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
you
think
I
be
too
old
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
pout
his
under
lip
and
shake
his
long
finger
upward
in
a
manner
totally
enigmatic
.
  
<EOS>
"
many
person
begin
later
than
other
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
betray
by
her
habitual
consciousness
of
have
valuable
information
to
bestow
.
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
take
no
notice
,
but
say
with
more
studied
gentleness
than
ever
,
"
You
have
probably
not
think
of
an
artistic
career
until
now
:
you
do
not
entertain
the
notion
,
the
longing
 
<EOS>
what
shall
I
say
?
 
<EOS>
you
do
not
wish
yourself
an
actress
,
or
anything
of
that
sort
,
till
the
present
trouble
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
exactly
<EOS>
:
but
I
be
fond
of
act
.
<EOS>
I
have
act
;
you
see
me
,
if
you
remember
 
you
see
me
here
in
charade
,
and
as
Hermione
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
really
fear
that
Klesmer
have
forget
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
"
he
answer
quickly
,
"
I
remember
 
I
remember
perfectly
,
"
and
again
walk
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
It
be
difficult
for
him
to
refrain
from
this
kind
of
movement
when
he
be
in
any
argument
either
audible
or
silent
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
feel
that
she
be
be
weigh
.
<EOS>
the
delay
be
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
but
she
do
not
yet
conceive
that
the
scale
could
dip
on
the
wrong
side
,
and
it
seem
to
her
only
graceful
to
say
,
"
I
shall
be
very
much
oblige
to
you
for
take
the
trouble
to
give
me
your
advice
,
whatever
it
maybe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Harleth
,
"
say
Klesmer
,
turn
toward
her
and
speak
with
a
slight
increase
of
accent
,
"
I
will
veil
nothing
from
you
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
I
should
reckon
myself
guilty
if
I
put
a
false
visage
on
thing
 
make
them
too
black
or
too
white
.
<EOS>
the
god
have
a
curse
for
him
who
willingly
tell
another
the
wrong
road
.
<EOS>
and
if
I
mislead
one
who
be
so
young
,
so
beautiful
 
<EOS>
who
,
I
trust
,
will
find
her
happiness
along
the
right
road
,
I
should
regard
myself
as
a
 
_
Bösewicht
_
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
the
last
word
Klesmer
's
voice
have
drop
to
a
loud
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
feel
a
sinking
of
heart
under
this
unexpected
solemnity
,
and
keep
a
sort
of
fascinated
gaze
on
Klesmer
's
face
,
as
he
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
beautiful
young
lady
 
you
have
be
bring
up
in
ease
 
<EOS>
you
have
do
what
you
would
 
<EOS>
you
have
not
say
to
yourself
,
"
I
must
know
this
exactly
<EOS>
,
"
"
I
must
understand
this
exactly
,
"
"
I
must
do
this
exactly
,
"
"
 
in
utter
these
three
terrible
_
must
_
<EOS>
,
Klesmer
lift
up
three
long
finger
in
succession
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
sum
,
you
have
not
be
call
upon
to
be
anything
but
a
charming
young
lady
,
whom
it
be
an
impoliteness
to
find
fault
with
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
pause
an
instant
;
then
rest
his
finger
on
his
hip
again
,
and
thrust
out
his
powerful
chin
,
he
say
    
"
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
with
that
preparation
,
you
wish
to
try
the
life
of
an
artist
;
you
wish
to
try
a
life
of
arduous
,
uncease
work
,
and
 
uncertain
praise
.
<EOS>
Your
praise
would
have
to
be
earn
,
like
your
bread
;
and
both
would
come
slowly
,
scantily
 
what
do
I
say
?
 
<EOS>
they
may
hardly
come
at
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
tone
of
discouragement
,
which
Klesmer
have
hope
may
suffice
without
anything
more
unpleasant
,
rouse
some
resistance
in
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
with
a
slight
turn
of
her
head
away
from
him
,
and
an
air
of
pique
,
she
say
    
"
I
think
that
you
,
be
an
artist
,
would
consider
the
life
one
of
the
most
honorable
and
delightful
.
<EOS>
and
if
I
can
do
nothing
well
?
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
can
put
up
with
the
same
risk
as
other
people
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
nothing
better
?
"
say
Klesmer
,
a
little
fired
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
my
dear
Miss
Harleth
,
you
could
do
nothing
well
 
<EOS>
neither
man
nor
woman
could
do
anything
well
 
if
you
could
do
what
be
good
or
good
of
its
kind
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
decry
the
life
of
the
true
artist
.
<EOS>
I
be
exalt
it
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
it
be
out
of
the
reach
of
any
but
choice
organization
 
nature
frame
to
love
perfection
and
to
labor
for
it
;
ready
,
like
all
true
lover
,
to
endure
,
to
wait
,
to
say
,
I
be
not
yet
worthy
,
but
<EOS>
she
 
Art
,
my
mistress
 
be
worthy
,
and
I
will
live
to
merit
her
.
<EOS>
an
honorable
life
?
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
but
the
honor
come
from
the
inward
vocation
and
the
hard
-
win
achievement
:
there
be
no
honor
in
don
the
life
as
a
livery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
some
excitement
of
yesterday
have
revive
in
Klesmer
and
hurry
him
into
speech
a
little
aloof
from
his
immediate
friendly
purpose
.
<EOS>
He
have
wish
as
delicately
as
possible
to
rouse
in
Gwendolen
a
sense
of
her
unfitness
for
a
perilous
,
difficult
course
;
but
it
be
his
will
not
to
be
angry
with
the
pretension
of
incompetence
,
and
he
be
in
danger
of
get
chafe
.
<EOS>
conscious
of
this
,
he
pause
suddenly
.
<EOS>
but
Gwendolen
's
chief
impression
be
that
he
have
not
yet
deny
her
the
power
of
do
what
would
be
good
of
its
kind
.
<EOS>
Klesmer
's
fervor
seem
to
be
a
sort
of
glamor
such
as
he
be
prone
to
throw
over
thing
in
general
;
and
what
she
desire
to
assure
him
of
be
that
she
be
not
afraid
of
some
preliminary
hardship
.
<EOS>
the
belief
that
to
present
herself
in
public
on
the
stage
must
produce
an
effect
such
as
she
have
be
use
to
feel
certain
of
in
private
life
;
be
like
a
bit
of
her
flesh
 
<EOS>
it
be
not
to
be
peel
off
readily
,
but
must
come
with
blood
and
pain
.
<EOS>
She
say
,
in
a
tone
of
some
insistance
    
<EOS>
"
I
be
quite
prepared
to
bear
hardship
at
first
.
<EOS>
of
course
no
one
can
become
celebrate
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
not
necessary
that
every
one
should
be
first
-
rate
 
either
actress
or
singer
.
<EOS>
if
you
would
be
so
kind
as
to

me

I
should
take

I
shall
have
the
courage
to
take
them

<EOS>
I
do
not
mind
go
up
hill
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
easy
than
the
dead
level
of
be
a
governess
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
any
step
you
recommend

"
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
be
convince
now
that
he
must
speak
plainly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
the
step
,
not
that
I
recommend
,
but
that
will
be
force
upon
you
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
one
,
so
far
,
what
your
goal
will
be
 
excellence
,
celebrity
,
second
,
third
rateness
 
<EOS>
it
be
all
one
.
<EOS>
You
must
go
to
town
under
the
protection
of
your
mother
.
<EOS>
You
must
put
yourself
under
training
 
<EOS>
musical
,
dramatic
,
theatrical
:
 
<EOS>
whatever
you
desire
to
do
you
have
to
learn
"
 
here
<EOS>
Gwendolen
look
as
if
she
be
go
to
speak
,
but
Klesmer
lift
up
his
hand
and
say
,
decisively
,
"
I
know
.
<EOS>
You
have
exercise
your
talent
 
<EOS>
you
recite
 
<EOS>
you
sing
 
from
the
drawing
-
room
_
standpunkt
_
.
<EOS>
My
dear
Fräulein
,
you
must
unlearn
all
that
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
yet
conceive
what
excellence
be
:
you
must
unlearn
your
mistaken
admiration
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
what
you
have
to
strive
for
,
and
then
you
must
subdue
your
mind
and
body
to
unbroken
discipline
.
<EOS>
Your
mind
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
for
you
must
not
be
think
of
celebrity
:
put
that
candle
out
of
your
eye
,
and
look
only
at
excellence
.
<EOS>
You
would
of
course
earn
nothing
 
<EOS>
you
could
get
no
engagement
for
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
You
would
need
money
for
yourself
and
your
family
.
<EOS>
but
that
,
"
here
Klesmer
frown
and
shake
his
finger
as
if
to
dismiss
a
triviality
,
"
that
could
perhaps
be
find
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
turn
pink
and
pale
during
this
speech
.
<EOS>
Her
pride
have
feel
a
terrible
knife
-
edge
,
and
the
last
sentence
only
make
the
smart
keener
.
<EOS>
She
be
conscious
of
appear
move
,
and
try
to
escape
from
her
weakness
by
suddenly
walk
to
a
seat
and
point
out
a
chair
to
Klesmer
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
take
it
,
but
turn
a
little
in
order
to
face
her
and
lean
against
the
piano
.
<EOS>
at
that
moment
she
wish
that
she
have
not
send
for
him
:
this
first
experience
of
be
take
on
some
other
ground
than
that
of
her
social
rank
and
her
beauty
be
become
bitter
to
her
.
<EOS>
Klesmer
,
preoccupy
with
a
serious
purpose
,
go
on
without
change
of
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
what
sort
of
issue
may
be
fairly
expect
from
all
this
self
-
denial
?
<EOS>
You
would
ask
that
.
<EOS>
It
be
right
that
your
eye
should
be
open
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
truthfully
.
<EOS>
this
issue
would
be
uncertain
,
and
,
most
probably
,
would
not
be
worth
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
these
relentless
word
Klesmer
put
out
his
lip
and
look
through
his
spectacle
with
the
air
of
a
monster
impenetrable
by
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
eye
begin
to
burn
,
but
the
dread
of
show
weakness
urge
her
to
add
self
-
control
.
<EOS>
She
compel
herself
to
say
,
in
a
hard
tone
    
<EOS>
"
You
think
I
want
talent
,
or
be
too
old
to
begin
.
"
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
make
a
sort
of
hum
,
and
then
descend
on
an
emphatic
"
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
the
desire
and
the
training
should
have
begin
seven
year
ago
 
or
a
good
deal
earlier
.
<EOS>
a
mountebank
's
child
who
help
her
father
to
earn
shilling
when
she
be
six
year
old
 
<EOS>
a
child
that
inherit
a
singe
throat
from
a
long
line
of
chorister
and
learn
to
sing
as
it
learn
to
talk
,
have
a
likelier
beginning
.
<EOS>
any
great
achievement
in
acting
or
in
music
grow
with
the
growth
.
<EOS>
whenever
an
artist
have
be
able
to
say
,
"
I
come
,
I
see
,
I
conquer
,
"
it
have
be
at
the
end
of
patient
practice
.
<EOS>
genius
at
first
be
little
more
than
a
great
capacity
for
receive
discipline
.
<EOS>
singing
and
acting
,
like
the
fine
dexterity
of
the
juggler
with
his
cup
and
ball
,
require
a
shaping
of
the
organ
toward
a
fine
and
fine
certainty
of
effect
.
<EOS>
Your
muscle
 
your
whole
frame
 
must
go
like
a
watch
,
true
,
true
to
a
hair
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
work
of
spring
-
time
,
before
habit
have
be
determine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
pretend
to
genius
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
still
feel
that
she
may
somehow
do
what
Klesmer
want
to
represent
as
impossible
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
suppose
that
I
may
have
a
little
talent
 
enough
to
improve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
deny
that
,
"
say
Klesmer
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
have
be
put
in
the
right
track
some
year
ago
and
have
work
well
you
may
now
have
make
a
public
singer
,
though
I
do
not
think
your
voice
would
have
count
for
much
in
public
.
<EOS>
for
the
stage
your
personal
charm
and
intelligence
may
then
have
tell
without
the
present
drawback
of
inexperience
 
lack
of
discipline
 
lack
of
instruction
.
"
  
<EOS>
certainly
Klesmer
seem
cruel
,
but
his
feeling
be
the
reverse
of
cruel
.
<EOS>
Our
speech
,
even
when
we
be
most
single
-
minded
,
can
never
take
its
line
absolutely
from
one
impulse
;
but
Klesmer
's
be
,
as
far
as
possible
,
direct
by
compassion
for
poor
Gwendolen
's
ignorant
eagerness
to
enter
on
a
course
of
which
he
see
all
the
miserable
detail
with
a
definiteness
which
he
could
not
if
he
would
have
convey
to
her
mind
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
however
,
be
not
convince
.
<EOS>
Her
self
-
opinion
rally
,
and
since
the
counselor
whom
she
have
call
in
give
a
decision
of
such
severe
peremptoriness
,
she
be
tempt
to
think
that
his
judgment
be
not
only
fallible
but
biased
.
<EOS>
It
occur
to
her
that
a
simple
and
wise
step
for
her
to
have
take
would
have
be
to
send
a
letter
through
the
post
to
the
manager
of
a
London
theatre
,
ask
him
to
make
an
appointment
.
<EOS>
She
would
make
no
further
reference
to
her
singing
;
Klesmer
,
she
see
,
have
set
himself
against
her
singing
.
<EOS>
but
she
feel
equal
to
argue
with
him
about
her
go
on
the
stage
,
and
she
answer
in
a
resistant
tone
    
<EOS>
"
I
understand
,
of
course
,
that
no
one
can
be
a
finished
actress
at
once
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
impossible
to
tell
beforehand
whether
I
should
succeed
;
but
that
seem
to
me
a
reason
why
I
should
try
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
think
that
I
may
have
take
an
engagement
at
a
theatre
meanwhile
,
so
as
to
earn
money
and
study
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
can
not
be
do
,
my
dear
Miss
Harleth
 
I
speak
plainly
 
it
can
not
be
do
.
<EOS>
I
must
clear
your
mind
of
these
notion
which
have
no
more
resemblance
to
reality
than
a
pantomime
.
<EOS>
lady
and
gentleman
think
that
when
they
have
make
their
toilet
and
draw
on
their
glove
they
be
as
presentable
on
the
stage
as
in
a
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
no
manager
think
that
.
<EOS>
with
all
your
grace
and
charm
,
if
you
be
to
present
yourself
as
an
aspirant
to
the
stage
,
a
manager
would
either
require
you
to
pay
as
an
amateur
for
be
allow
to
perform
or
he
would
tell
you
to
go
and
be
teach
 
train
to
bear
yourself
on
the
stage
,
as
a
horse
,
however
beautiful
,
must
be
train
for
the
circus
;
to
say
nothing
of
that
study
which
would
enable
you
to
personate
a
character
consistently
,
and
animate
it
with
the
natural
language
of
face
,
gesture
,
and
tone
.
<EOS>
for
you
to
get
an
engagement
fit
for
you
<EOS>
straight
away
be
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
can
not
understand
that
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
rather
haughtily
 
then
,
check
herself
,
she
add
in
another
tone
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
oblige
to
you
if
you
will
explain
how
it
be
that
such
poor
actress
get
engage
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
to
the
theatre
several
time
,
and
I
be
sure
there
be
actress
who
seem
to
me
to
act
not
at
all
well
and
who
be
quite
plain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
my
dear
Miss
Harleth
,
that
be
the
easy
criticism
of
the
buyer
.
<EOS>
We
who
buy
slipper
toss
away
this
pair
and
the
other
as
clumsy
;
but
there
go
an
apprenticeship
to
the
making
of
them
.
<EOS>
excuse
me
;
you
could
not
at
present
teach
one
of
those
actress
;
but
there
be
certainly
much
that
she
could
teach
you
.
<EOS>
for
example
,
she
can
pitch
her
voice
so
as
to
be
hear
:
ten
to
one
you
could
not
do
it
till
after
many
trial
.
<EOS>
merely
to
stand
and
move
on
the
stage
be
an
art
 
require
practice
.
<EOS>
It
be
understand
that
we
be
not
now
talk
of
a
_
comparse
_
in
a
petty
theatre
who
earn
the
wage
of
a
needle
-
woman
.
<EOS>
that
be
out
of
the
question
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
must
earn
more
than
that
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
with
a
sense
of
wince
rather
than
of
be
refute
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
think
I
could
soon
learn
to
do
tolerably
well
all
those
little
thing
you
have
mention
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
so
very
stupid
.
<EOS>
and
even
in
Paris
,
I
be
sure
<EOS>
,
I
see
two
actress
play
important
lady
'
part
who
be
not
at
all
lady
and
quite
ugly
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
have
no
particular
talent
,
but
I
_
must
_
think
it
be
an
advantage
,
even
on
the
stage
,
to
be
a
lady
and
not
a
perfect
fright
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
let
us
understand
each
other
,
"
say
Klesmer
,
with
a
flash
of
new
meaning
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
speak
of
what
you
would
have
to
go
through
if
you
aim
at
become
a
real
artist
 
if
you
take
music
and
the
drama
as
a
high
vocation
in
which
you
would
strive
after
excellence
.
<EOS>
on
that
head
,
what
I
have
say
stand
fast
.
<EOS>
You
would
find
 
after
your
education
in
do
thing
slackly
for
one
-
and
-
twenty
year
 
great
difficulty
in
study
;
you
would
find
mortification
in
the
treatment
you
would
get
when
you
present
yourself
on
the
footing
of
skill
.
<EOS>
You
would
be
subject
to
test
;
people
would
no
longer
feign
not
to
see
your
blunder
.
<EOS>
You
would
at
first
only
be
accept
on
trial
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
to
bear
what
I
may
call
a
glare
insignificance
:
any
success
must
be
win
by
the
utmost
patience
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
to
keep
your
place
in
a
crowd
,
and
after
all
it
be
likely
you
would
lose
it
and
get
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
if
you
determine
to
face
these
hardship
and
still
try
,
you
will
have
the
dignity
of
a
high
purpose
,
even
though
you
may
have
choose
unfortunately
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
some
merit
,
though
you
may
win
no
prize
.
<EOS>
You
have
ask
my
judgment
on
your
chance
of
win
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
pretend
to
speak
absolutely
;
but
measure
probability
,
my
judgment
be
:
 
you
will
hardly
achieve
more
than
mediocrity
.
"
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
have
deliver
himself
with
emphatic
rapidity
,
and
now
pause
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
be
motionless
,
look
at
her
hand
,
which
lie
over
each
other
on
her
lap
,
till
the
deep
-
toned
,
long
-
draw
"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
but
_
,
"
with
which
he
resume
,
have
a
startling
effect
,
and
make
her
look
at
him
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
 
there
be
certainly
other
idea
,
other
disposition
with
which
a
young
lady
may
take
up
an
art
that
will
bring
her
before
the
public
.
<EOS>
She
may
rely
on
the
unquestioned
power
of
her
beauty
as
a
passport
.
<EOS>
She
may
desire
to
exhibit
herself
to
an
admiration
which
dispense
with
skill
.
<EOS>
this
go
a
certain
way
on
the
stage
:
not
in
music
:
but
on
the
stage
,
beauty
be
take
when
there
be
nothing
more
commanding
to
be
have
.
<EOS>
not
without
some
drilling
,
however
:
as
I
have
say
before
,
technicality
have
in
any
case
to
be
master
.
<EOS>
but
these
except
,
we
have
here
nothing
to
do
with
art
.
<EOS>
the
woman
who
take
up
this
career
be
not
an
artist
:
she
be
usually
one
who
think
of
enter
on
a
luxurious
life
by
a
short
and
easy
road
 
perhaps
by
marriage
 
<EOS>
that
be
her
most
brilliant
chance
,
and
the
rare
.
<EOS>
still
,
her
career
will
not
be
luxurious
to
begin
with
:
she
can
hardly
earn
her
own
poor
bread
independently
at
once
,
and
the
indignity
she
will
be
liable
to
be
such
as
I
will
not
speak
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
desire
to
be
independent
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
deeply
sting
and
confusedly
apprehend
some
scorn
for
herself
in
Klesmer
's
word
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
my
reason
for
ask
whether
I
could
not
get
an
immediate
engagement
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
can
not
know
how
thing
go
on
about
theatre
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
that
I
could
have
make
myself
independent
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
money
,
and
I
will
not
accept
help
from
any
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
wounded
pride
could
not
rest
without
make
this
disclaimer
.
<EOS>
It
be
intolerable
to
her
that
Klesmer
should
imagine
her
to
have
expect
other
help
from
him
than
advice
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
hard
say
for
your
friend
,
"
say
Klesmer
,
recover
the
gentleness
of
tone
with
which
he
have
begin
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
give
you
pain
.
<EOS>
that
be
inevitable

<EOS>
I
be
bind
to
put
the
truth
,
the
unvarnished
truth
,
before
you

<EOS>
I
have
not

I
will
not
say
 
you
will
do
wrong
to
choose
the
hard
,

You
have
to
compare
its
difficulty
with
those

less
hazardous
 
any
more
private
course
which
open
itself
to
you

<EOS>
if
you
take
that

courageous

I
will
ask
leave
to
shake
hand
with
you
on

<EOS>
Gwendolen
be
silent
,
again
look
at
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
feel
herself
very
far
away
from
take
the
resolve
that
would
enforce
acceptance
;
and
after
wait
an
instant
or
two
,
Klesmer
go
on
with
deepened
seriousness
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
there
be
the
duty
of
service
there
must
be
the
duty
of
accept
it

<EOS>
the
question
be
not
one
of
personal
obligation
.
<EOS>
and
in
relation
to
practical
matter
immediately
affect
your
future
 
excuse
my
permit
myself
to
mention
in
confidence
an
affair
of
my

<EOS>
I
be
expect
an
event
which
would
make
it
easy
for
me
to
exert
myself
on
your
behalf
in
further
your
opportunity
of
instruction
and
residence
in
London
 
under
the
care
,
that
is
,
of
your
family
 
without
need
for
anxiety
on
your
part

<EOS>
if
you
resolve
to
take
art
as
a
bread
-
study
,
you
need
only
undertake
the
study
at
first
;
the
bread
will
be
find
without
trouble
.
<EOS>
the
event
I
mean
be
my
marriage
 
in
fact
 
you
will
receive
this
as
a
matter
of
confidence
 
my
marriage
with
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
which
will
more
than
double
such
right
as
I
have
to
be
trust
by
you
as
a
friend
.
<EOS>
Your
friendship
will
have
greatly
rise
in
value
for
_

by
your
have
adopt
that
generous
labor

"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
face
have
begin
to
burn
.
<EOS>
that
Klesmer
be
about
to
marry
Miss
Arrowpoint
<EOS>
cause
her
no
surprise
,
and
at
another
moment
she
would
have
amuse
herself
in
quickly
imagine
the
scene
that
must
have
occur
at
Quetcham
.
<EOS>
but
what
engross
her
feeling
,
what
fill
her
imagination
now
,
be
the
panorama
of
her
own
immediate
future
that
Klesmer
's
word
seem
to
have
unfold
.
<EOS>
the
suggestion
of
Miss
Arrowpoint
as
a
patroness
be
only
another
detail
add
to
its
repulsiveness
:
Klesmer
's
proposal
to
help
her
seem
an
additional
irritation
after
the
humiliating
judgment
he
have
pass
on
her
capability
.
<EOS>
His
word
have
really
bite
into
her
self
-
confidence
and
turn
it
into
the
pain
of
a
bleed
wound
;
and
the
idea
of
present
herself
before
other
judge
be
now
poison
with
the
dread
that
they
also
may
be
harsh
;
they
also
would
not
recognize
the
talent
she
be
conscious
of
.
<EOS>
but
she
control
herself
,
and
rise
from
her
seat
before
she
make
any
answer
.
<EOS>
It
seem
natural
that
she
should
pause
.
<EOS>
She
go
to
the
piano
and
look
absently
at
leave
of
music
,
pinch
up
the
corner
.
<EOS>
at
last
she
turn
toward
Klesmer
and
say
,
with
almost
her
usual
air
of
proud
equality
,
which
in
this
interview
have
not
be
hitherto
perceptible
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
congratulate
you
sincerely
,
Herr
Klesmer
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
never
see
any
one
so
admirable
as
Miss
Arrowpoint
.
<EOS>
and
I
have
to
thank
you
for
every
sort
of
kindness
this
morning
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
decide
now
.
<EOS>
if
I
make
the
resolve
you
have
speak
of
,
I
will
use
your
permission
 
<EOS>
I
will
let
you
know
.
<EOS>
but
I
fear
the
obstacle
be
too
great
.
<EOS>
in
any
case
,
I
be
deeply
obliged
to
you
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
bold
of
me
to
ask
you
to
take
this
trouble
.
"
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
's
inward
remark
be
,
"
She
will
never
let
me
know
.
"
<EOS>
but
with
the
most
thorough
respect
in
his
manner
,
he
say
,
"
command
me
at
any
time
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
address
on
this
card
which
will
always
find
me
with
little
delay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
he
have
take
up
his
hat
and
be
go
to
make
his
bow
,
Gwendolen
's
well
self
,
conscious
of
an
ingratitude
which
the
clear
-
see
Klesmer
must
have
penetrate
,
make
a
desperate
effort
to
find
its
way
above
the
stifle
layer
of
egoistic
disappointment
and
irritation
.
<EOS>
look
at
him
with
a
glance
of
the
old
gayety
,
she
put
out
her
hand
,
and
say
with
a
smile
,
"
if
I
take
the
wrong
road
,
it
will
not
be
because
of
your
flattery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
forbid
that
you
should
take
any
road
but
one
where
you
will
find
and
give
happiness
!
"
say
Klesmer
,
fervently
.
<EOS>
then
,
in
foreign
fashion
,
he
touch
her
finger
lightly
with
his
lip
,
and
in
another
minute
she
hear
the
sound
of
his
depart
wheel
get
more
distant
on
the
gravel
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
have
never
in
her
life
feel
so
miserable
.
<EOS>
no
sob
come
,
no
passion
of
tear
,
to
relieve
her
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
be
burn
;
and
the
noonday
only
bring
into
more
dreary
clearness
the
absence
of
interest
from
her
life
.
<EOS>
all
memory
,
all
object
,
the
piece
of
music
display
,
the
open
piano
 
<EOS>
the
very
reflection
of
herself
in
the
glass
 
seem
no
well
than
the
pack
-
up
show
of
a
depart
fair
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
since
her
consciousness
begin
,
she
be
have
a
vision
of
herself
on
the
common
level
,
and
have
lose
the
innate
sense
that
there
be
reason
why
she
should
not
be
slight
,
elbow
,
jostle
 
treat
like
a
passenger
with
a
third
-
class
ticket
,
in
spite
of
private
objection
on
her
own
part
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
move
about
<EOS>
;
the
prospect
begotten
by
disappointment
be
too
oppressively
preoccupy
;
she
throw
herself
into
the
shady
corner
of
a
settee
,
and
press
her
finger
over
her
burn
eyelid
.
<EOS>
every
word
that
Klesmer
have
say
seem
to
have
be
brand
into
her
memory
,
as
most
word
be
which
bring
with
them
a
new
set
of
impression
and
make
an
epoch
for
us
.
<EOS>
only
a
few
hour
before
,
the
dawn
smile
of
self
-
contentment
rest
on
her
lip
as
she
vaguely
imagine
a
future
suit
to
her
wish
:
it
seem
but
the
affair
of
a
year
or
so
for
her
to
become
the
most
approve
Juliet
of
the
time
:
or
,
if
Klesmer
encourage
her
idea
of
be
a
singer
,
to
proceed
by
more
gradual
step
to
her
place
in
the
opera
,
while
she
win
money
and
applause
by
occasional
performance
.
<EOS>
why
not
?
<EOS>
at
home
,
at
school
,
among
acquaintance
,
she
have
be
use
to
have
her
conscious
superiority
admit
;
and
she
have
move
in
a
society
where
everything
,
from
low
arithmetic
to
high
art
,
be
of
the
amateur
kind
,
politely
suppose
to
fall
short
of
perfection
only
because
gentleman
and
lady
be
not
oblige
to
do
more
than
they
like
 
<EOS>
otherwise
they
would
probably
give
forth
able
writing
,
and
show
themselves
more
command
artist
than
any
the
world
be
at
present
oblige
to
put
up
with
.
<EOS>
the
self
-
confident
vision
that
have
beguile
her
be
not
of
a
highly
exceptional
kind
;
and
she
have
at
least
show
some
rationality
in
consult
the
person
who
know
the
most
and
have
flatter
her
the
least
.
<EOS>
in
ask
Klesmer
's
advice
,
however
,
she
have
rather
be
bear
up
by
a
belief
in
his
latent
admiration
than
bent
on
know
anything
more
unfavorable
that
may
have
lain
behind
his
slight
objection
to
her
singing
;
and
the
truth
she
have
ask
for
,
with
an
expectation
that
it
would
be
agreeable
,
have
come
like
a
lacerating
thong
.
  
<EOS>
"
too
old
 
should
have
begin
seven
year
ago
 
you
will
not
,
at
best
,
achieve
more

mediocrity
 
hard
,
incessant
work
,
uncertain
praise
 
<EOS>
bread
come
slowly
,
scantily
,
perhaps
not
at
all
 
mortification
,
people
no
longer
feign
not
to
see
<EOS>
your
blunder
 
glare
insignificance
<EOS>
"
 
all
these
phrase
rankle
in
her
;
and
even
more
gall
be
the
hint
that
she
could
only
be
accept
on
the
stage
as
a
beauty
who
hope
to
get
a
husband
.
<EOS>
the
"
indignity
"
that
she
may
be
visit
with
have
no
very
definite
form
for
her
,
but
the
mere
association
of
anything
call
"
indignity
"
with
herself
,
rouse
a
resentful
alarm
.
<EOS>
and
along
with
the
vaguer
image
which
be
raise
by
those
biting
word
,
come
the
precise
conception
of
disagreeable
which
her
experience
enable
her
to
imagine
.
<EOS>
how
could
she
take
her
mamma
and
the
four
sister
to
London
?
<EOS>
if
it
be
not
possible
for
her
to
earn
money
at
once
?
<EOS>
and
as
for
submit
to
be
a
_
protégé
_
,
and
ask
her
mamma
to
submit
with
her
to
the
humiliation
of
be
support
by
Miss
Arrowpoint
 
that
be
as
bad
as
be
a
governess
;
nay
,
bad
;
for
suppose
the
end
of
all
her
study
to
be
as
worthless
as
Klesmer
clearly
expect
it
to
be
,
the
sense
of
favor
receive
and
never
repay
,
would
embitter
the
misery
of
disappointment
.
<EOS>
Klesmer
doubtless
have
magnificent
idea
about
help
artist
;
but
how
could
he
know
the
feeling
of
lady
in
such
matter
?
<EOS>
It
be
all
over
:
she
have
entertain
a
mistaken
hope
;
and
there
be
an
end
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
an
end
of
it
!
<EOS>
"
say
Gwendolen
,
aloud
,
start
from
her
seat
as
she
hear
the
step
and
voice
of
her
mamma
and
sister
come
in
from
church
.
<EOS>
She
hurry
to
the
piano
and
begin
gather
together
her
piece
of
music
with
assumed
diligence
,
while
the
expression
on
her
pale
face
and
in
her
burn
eye
be
what
would
have
suit
a
woman
endure
a
wrong
which
she
may
not
resent
,
but
would
probably
revenge
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
darling

say
gentle
Mrs.
Davilow
,
enter
,
"
I
see
by
the
wheel
-
mark
that

here

you
be
satisfied

the
interview

She
have
some
guess
as
to

object

timid
about

yes

say
Gwendolen
,
in
a
high
,
hard
tone
,
for
which
she
must
be
excuse
,
because
she
dread
a
scene
of
emotion
.
<EOS>
if
she
do
not
set
herself
resolutely
to
feign
proud
indifference
,
she
feel
that
she
must
fall
into
a
passionate
outburst
of
despair
,
which
would
cut
her
mamma
more
deeply
than
all
the
rest

their
calamity

"
Your

up

on
her

,
with
a
drop
in

voice
to
the
low
undertone

the

be
construct
with
a

agreeably

<EOS>
It
be
her
temper
that
frame
her
sentence

new

she
could
have
speak
more
suitably

though
it
be
never
her
aspiration

express
herself
virtuously

cleverly

point
to
be
remember
in
extenuation

bad

and
,
notwithstanding
the
keen

of
her

she
be
capable
of
some
compunction
when
her
uncle

aunt
receive
her
with
a
more
affectionate
kindness
than
they
have
ever
show
before

<EOS>
She
could
not

be
strike
by
the
dignified
cheerfulness
with
which
they
talk

the
necessary
economy
in
their
way

in

<EOS>
Mr.

's
worth
of
character
,
a
little
obscure
by
worldly
opportunity
 
as
the
poetic
beauty

be
obscure
by
the

show
itself
to
great
advantage
under
this
sudden
reduction
of
fortune

<EOS>
Prompt

methodical
,
he
have
set
himself
not

to
put
down
his
carriage

to
reconsider
his
worn
suit

to
leave
off
meat

to

<EOS>
for

healthy

have
its
pleasure

the

have
spread
through

<EOS>
Mrs.

Anna

who
always
make
papa
their
model
,
really
do
not
miss
anything
they
care
about
for
themselves
,

in
all
sincerity
feel
that
the
sad
part
of
the
family
loss
be
the
change
for
Mrs.
Davilow
and
her
child
.
  
<EOS>
Anna
for
the
first
time
could
merge
her
resentment
on
behalf
of
Rex
in
her
sympathy
with
Gwendolen
;
and
Mrs.
Gascoigne
be
dispose
to
hope
that
trouble
would
have
a
salutary
effect
on
her
niece
,
without
think
it
her
duty
to
add
any
bitter
by
way
of
increase
the
salutariness

<EOS>
They
have
both
be
busy
devise
how
to
get
blind
and
curtain
for
the
cottage
out
of
the
household
store
;
but
with
delicate
feeling
they
leave
these
matter
in
the
back
-
ground
,
and
talk
at
first
of
Gwendolen
's
journey
,
and
the
comfort
it
be
to
her
mamma
to
have
her
at
home
again
.
  
<EOS>
in
fact
there
be
nothing
for
Gwendolen
to
take
as
a
justification
for
extend
her
discontent
with
event
to
the
person
immediately
around
her
,
and
she
feel
shake
into
a
more
alert
attention
,
as
if
by
a
call
to
drill
that
everybody
else
be
obey
,
when
her
uncle
begin
in
a
voice
of
firm
kindness
to
talk
to
her
of
the
effort
he
have
be
make
to
get
her
a
situation
which
would
offer
her
as
many
advantage
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
have
not
forget
Grandcourt
,
but
the
possibility
of
further
advance
from
that
quarter
be
something
too
vague
for
a
man
of
his
good
sense
to
be
determine
by
it
:
uncertainty
of
that
kind
must
not
now
slacken
his
action
in
do
the
good
he
could
for
his
niece
under
actual
condition
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
that
there
be
no

to
be
lose

Gwendolen

for
a
position
in
a
good

you
will
have
some
consideration
be
not

be
have
at
a
moment

notice

<EOS>
and
however
long
we
wait
we
could
hardly
find
one
where
you
would
be
well
off
than
at
Bishop
Mompert
's
.
<EOS>
I
be
know
to
both
him
and
Mrs.
Mompert
,
and
that
of
course
be
an
advantage
to
you

<EOS>
Our
correspondence
have
go
on
favorably
;
but
I
can
not
be
surprised
that
Mrs.
Mompert
wish
to
see
you
before
make
an
absolute
engagement

<EOS>
She
think
of
arrange
for
you
to
meet
her
at
Wanchester
when
she
be
on
her
way
to
town
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
will
feel
the
interview
rather
try
for
you
,
<EOS>
my
dear

but
you
will
have
a
little
time
to
prepare
your
mind
.

do
you
know

why

she
want

say
Gwendolen
,
whose
mind
have
quickly
go
over
various
reason
that
an
imaginary
Mrs.
Mompert
with
three
daughter
may
be
suppose
to
entertain
,
reason
all
of
a
disagreeable
kind
to
the
person
present
herself
for
inspection

<EOS>
the
rector
smile
.
<EOS>
"
do
not

my
dear

<EOS>
She
would
like
to
have
a
more
precise
idea
of
you
than
my
report
can
give
.
<EOS>
and
a
mother
be
naturally
scrupulous
about
a
companion
for
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
I
have
tell
her
you
be
very
young
.
<EOS>
but
she
herself
exercise
a
close
supervision
over
her
daughter
'
education
,
and
that
make
her
less
anxious
as
to
age

<EOS>
She
be
a
woman
of
taste
and
also
of
strict
principle
,
and
object
to
have
a
french
person
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
that
she
will
think
your
manner
and
accomplishment
as
good
as
she
be
likely
to
find
;

over
the
religious
and
moral
tone
of

education
she

indeed
the
bishop

,
will
preside

<EOS>
Gwendolen
dare
not
answer
,
but
the
repression
of
her
decide
dislike
to
the
whole
prospect
send
an
unusually
deep
flush
over
her
face

neck

subside
as
quickly

it
come

<EOS>
Anna

full
of
tender
fear

put
her
little
hand
into

cousin

Mr.
Gascoigne
be
too
kind

trial

this
sudden
change
must
be
for

I

so
highly

It
be
really
a

with
a
continuance

high

<EOS>
the
bishop
's
view
be

decidedly
Low
Church
color
than
my
own
 
<EOS>
he
be
a
close
friend
of
Lord
Grampian

,
though
privately
strict

he
be
not
by
any
mean
narrow
in
public
matter

<EOS>
indeed
,
he
have
create
as
little
dislike
in
his

as
any

He
have
always
remain
friendly

though
before
his

when

be
an
incumbent

we
have
a
little
controversy
about
the
Bible
Society

<EOS>
the
rector

word
be
too
pregnant

satisfactory

to
Gwendolen

form

desperately

rather
a
depreciatory

I
should
not
have
the

satisfaction

would
be
much
hard
work

you
be
aware

good

you

"
oh

no

Mrs.

Gwendolen

memory
of
school
suggest
other
particular
which
force
her
to
admit
to
herself
that
this
alternative
would
be
no
relief

She
turn
to
her

again

apparently
in
acceptance

end
very
cheerfully

leave

the
satisfactory
conviction

Gwendolen
be
go
to
adapt

to
circumstance
like
a

good
sense

<EOS>
have
speak
appropriately

naturally

to
be
ask

add

take
the
letter
from

look
rather
frightened

she
do
not

the
proud

run
her

apparently
she

find

however

he
tell
us

be
what
have
help
both
Mrs.

to
show
Gwendolen
an
unmixed
kindliness

she
herself
feel
very
amiably
about
it

smile
at
Anna
,
and
pinch
her
chin
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
nothing

wrong

you
now

it
?

<EOS>
She
have
no
gratuitously
ill

natured
feeling

egoistic
pleasure
in
make
man
miserable

<EOS>
She
only
have
an
intense
objection
to
their
make
her
miserable

<EOS>
but
when
the
talk
turn
on
furniture
for
the
cottage
Gwendolen
be
not
rouse
to
show
even
a
languid
interest
.
<EOS>
She
think
that
she
have
do
as
much
as
could
be
expect
of
her
this
morning
,
and
indeed
feel
at
an
heroic
pitch
in
keep
to
herself
the
struggle
that

go
on
within
her

the
recoil

her
mind

the
idea
of
present
herself
before
Mrs.
Mompert
in

first
instance

to
be
approve

come
as
pressure
on
an
already
painful
bruise
;
even
as
a
governess
,
it
appear
she
be
to
be
test
and
be
liable
to
rejection
.
<EOS>
after
she
have
do
herself
the
violence
to
accept
the
bishop
and
his
wife
,
they
be
still
to
consider
whether
they
would
accept
her
;
it
be
at
her
peril
that
she
be
to
look
,
speak
,
or
be
silent
.
<EOS>
and
even
when
she
have
enter
on
her
dismal
task
of
self

constraint
in
the
society
of
three
girl
whom
she
be
bind
incessantly
to
edify

the
same
process
of
inspection
be
to
go
on
:
there
be
always
to
be
Mrs.
Mompert
's
supervision
;
always
something
or
other
would
be
expect
of
her
to
which
she
have
not
the
slight
inclination
;
and
perhaps
the
bishop
would
examine
her
on
serious
topic
.

Gwendolen

would
have
pity
the
dullness
of
the
bishop
rather
than
have
be
embarrass
by
him
,
see
the
life
before
her
as
an
entrance
into
a
penitentiary
.
<EOS>
wild
thought
of
run
away
to
be
an
actress
,
in
spite
of
Klesmer
,
come
to
her
with
the
lure
of
freedom
;
but
his
word
still
hang
heavily
on
her
soul
;
they
have
alarm
her
pride
and
even
her
maidenly
dignity
:
<EOS>
dimly
she
conceive
herself
get
amongst
vulgar
people
who
would
treat
her
with
rude
familiarity
 
odious
man
,
whose
grin
and
smirk
would
not
be
see
through
the
strong
grating
of
polite
society
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
daring
be
not
in
the
least
that
of
the
adventuress
;
the
demand
to
be
hold
a
lady
be
in
her
very
marrow
;
and
when
she
have
dream
that
she
may
be
the
heroine
of
the
gaming
-
table
,
it
be
with
the
understanding
that
no
one
should
treat
her
with
the
less
consideration
,
or
presume
to
look
at
her
with
irony
as
Deronda
have
do
.
<EOS>
to
be
protect
and
pet
,
and
to
have
her
susceptibility
consult
in
every
detail
,
have
go
along
with
her
food
and
clothing
as
matter
of
course
in
her
life
:
even
without
any
such
warning
as
Klesmer
's
she
could
not
have
think
it
an
attractive
freedom
to
be
throw
in
solitary
dependence
on
the
doubtful
civility
of
stranger
.
<EOS>
the
endurance
of
the
episcopal
penitentiary
be
less
repulsive
than
that
;
though
here
too
she
would
certainly
never
be
pet
or
have
her
susceptibility
consult
.
<EOS>
Her
rebellion
against
this
hard
necessity
which
have
come
just
to
her
of
all
people
in
the
world
 
to
her
whom
all
circumstance
have
concur
in
prepare
for
something
quite
different
 
be
exaggerate
instead
of
diminish
as
one
hour
<EOS>
follow
another
,
with
the
imagination
of
what
she
may
have
expect
in
her
lot
and
what
it
be
actually
to
be
.
<EOS>
the
family
trouble
,
she
think
,
be
easy
for
every
one
than
for
her
 
even
for
poor
dear
mamma
,
because
she
have
always
use
herself
to
not
enjoy
.
<EOS>
as
to
hope
that
if
she
go
to
the
Momperts
'
and
be
patient
a
little
while
,
thing
may
get
well
 
<EOS>
it
would
be
stupid
to
entertain
hope
for
herself
after
all
that
have
happen
:
her
talent
<EOS>
,
it
appear
,
would
never
be
recognize
as
anything
remarkable
,
and
there
be
not
a
single
direction
in
which
probability
seem
to
flatter
her
wish
.
<EOS>
some
beautiful
girl
who
,
like
her
,
have
read
romance
where
even
plain
governess
be
centre
of
attraction
and
be
seek
in
marriage
,
may
have
solace
themselves
a
little
by
transport
such
picture
into
their
own
future
;
but
even
if
Gwendolen
's
experience
have
lead
her
to
dwell
on
love
-
making
and
marriage
as
her
elysium
,
her
heart
be
too
much
oppress
by
what
be
near
to
her
,
in
both
the
past
and
the
future
,
for
her
to
project
her
anticipation
very
far
off
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
world
-
nausea
upon
her
,
and
see
no
reason
all
through
her
life
why
she
should
wish
to
live
.
<EOS>
no
religious
view
of
trouble
help
her
:
her
trouble
have
in
her
opinion
all
be
cause
by
other
people
's
disagreeable
or
wicked
conduct
;
and
there
be
really
nothing
pleasant
to
be
count
on
in
the
world
<EOS>
:
that
be
her
feeling
;
everything
else
she
have
hear
say
about
trouble
be
mere
phrase
-
make
not
attractive
enough
for
her
to
have
catch
it
up
and
repeat
it
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
sweetness
of
labor
and
fulfil
claim
;
the
interest
of
inward
and
outward
activity
;
the
impersonal
delight
of
life
as
a
perpetual
discovery
;
the
due
of
courage
,
fortitude
,
industry
,
which
it
be
mere
baseness
not
to
pay
toward
the
common
burden
;
the
supreme
worth
of
the
teacher
's
vocation
;
 
these
,
even
if
they
have
be
eloquently
preach
to
her
,
could
have
be
no
more
than
faintly
apprehend
doctrine
:
the
fact
which
work
upon
her
be
her
invariable
observation
that
for
a
lady
to
become
a
governess
 
to
"
take
a
situation
"
 
<EOS>
be
to
descend
in
life
and
to
be
treat
at
best
with
a
compassionate
patronage
.
<EOS>
and
poor
Gwendolen
have
never
dissociate
happiness
from
personal
pre
-
eminence
and
_
éclat
_
.
<EOS>
that
where
these
threaten
to
forsake
her
,
she
should
take
life
to
be
hardly
worth
the
have
,
can
not
make
her
so
unlike
the
rest
of
us
,
man
or
woman
,
that
we
should
cast
her
out
of
our
compassion
;
our
moment
of
temptation
to
a
mean
opinion
of
thing
in
general
be
usually
dependent
on
some
susceptibility
about
ourselves
and
some
dullness
to
subject
which
every
one
else
would
consider
more
important
.
<EOS>
surely
a
young
creature
be
pitiable
who
have
the
labyrinth
of
life
before
her
and
no
clue
 
to
whom
distrust
in
herself
and
her
good
fortune
have
come
as
a
sudden
shock
,
like
a
rent
across
the
path
that
she
be
tread
carelessly
.
  
<EOS>
in
spite
of
her
healthy
frame
,
her
irreconcilable
repugnance
affect
her
even
physically
;
she
feel
a
sort
of
numbness
and
could
set
about
nothing
;
the
least
urgency
,
even
that
she
should
take
her
meal
,
be
an
irritation
to
her
;
the
speech
of
other
on
any
subject
seem
unreasonable
,
because
it
do
not
include
her
feeling
and
be
an
ignorant
claim
on
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
in
her
nature
to
busy
herself
with
the
fancy
of
suicide
to
which
disappointed
young
people
be
prone
:
what
occupy
and
exasperate
her
be
the
sense
that
there
be
nothing
for
her
but
to
live
in
a
way
she
hate
.
<EOS>
She
avoid
go
to
the
rectory
again
:
it
be
too
intolerable
to
have
to
look
and
talk
as
if
she
be
compliant
;
and
she
could
not
exert
herself
to
show
interest
about
the
furniture
of
that
horrible
cottage
.
<EOS>
Miss
Merry
be
stay
on
purpose
to
help
,
and
such
people
as
Jocosa
like
that
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
have
to
make
excuse
for
her
not
appear
,
even
when
Anna
come
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
for
that
calm
which
Gwendolen
have
promise
herself
to
maintain
have
change
into
sick
motivelessness
:
she
think
,
"
I
suppose
I
shall
begin
to
pretend
by
-
and
-
by
,
but
why
should
I
do
it
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
mother
watch
her
with
silent
distress
;
and
,
lapse
into
the
habit
of
indulgent
tenderness
<EOS>
,
she
begin
to
think
what
she
imagine
that
Gwendolen
be
think
,
and
to
wish
that
everything
should
give
way
to
the
possibility
of
make
her
darling
less
miserable
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
when
she
be
in
the
black
and
yellow
bedroom
and
her
mother
be
linger
there
under
the
pretext
of
considering
and
arrange
Gwendolen
's
article
of
dress
,
she
suddenly
rouse
herself
to
fetch
the
casket
which
contain
the
ornament
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mamma

"
she
begin
,
glance
over
the
upper

"
I
have
forget
these

<EOS>
why
do
not
you
remind
me
of

<EOS>
do

<EOS>
You

about

<EOS>
You

all
to

long

<EOS>
She
lift
the
upper
tray
and
look
below

<EOS>
"
if
we
can
do
without

I

rather
keep
them
for

"
say
Mrs.
Davilow
,
seat
herself
beside
Gwendolen
with
a
feeling
of
relief
that
she
be
begin
to
talk
about
something
.
<EOS>
the
usual
relation
between
them
have
become
reversed
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
the
mother
who
try
to
cheer
the
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
how
come
you
to
put
that
pocket
handkerchief
in
here
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
handkerchief
with
the
corner
<EOS>
tear
off
which
Gwendolen
have
thrust
in
with
the
turquoise
necklace

<EOS>
"
It
happen

<EOS>
I
be
in
a

<EOS>
say
Gwendolen
,
take
the
handkerchief
away
and
put
it
in
her
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
sell
the
necklace
,
mamma

"
she
add
,
a
new
feeling
have
come
over
her
about
that
rescue
of
it
which
have
formerly
be
so
offensive
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
dear

no
;
it
be
make
out

fact
about
Gwendolen

that
he
have
carry
off
his

after
a
moment

pause
she
go
on

these

on

that

Gwendolen
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"
governess
do
not

<EOS>
You
have
better
get
me
a

no

Gwendolen
bitterly
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
there

anything
you

so

<EOS>
"
oh
,
mamma

there
be
nothing
to
tell

<EOS>
I
can
not

anything
well

I
must
think
myself
fortunate

I

you

have
all
the
eighty
pound

<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
far
that
will
go
in
housekeeping

but
you
need
not
stitch
your
poor
finger
to
the
bone

and
stare
away
all
the
sight
that
the
tear
have
leave
in
your

"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
do
not
give
any
caress
with
her
word
as
she
have
be
use
to
do
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
even
look
at
her
mother
,
but
be
look
at
the
turquoise
necklace
as
she
turn
it
over
her
finger
.
  
<EOS>
"
bless
you
for
your
tenderness

Mrs.

with
tear
in

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
any
reason
for
expect
it
,
mamma
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
in
a
hard
tone
;
and
Mrs.
Davilow
be
silent
,
think
as
she
have
often
think
before
 
"
what
do
happen
between
her
and
Mr.
Grandcourt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
_
will
_
keep
this
necklace
,
mamma
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
lay
it
apart
and
then
close
the
casket
.
<EOS>
"
but
do
get
the
other
thing
sell
,
even
if
they
will
not
bring
much
.
<EOS>
ask
my
uncle
what
to
do
with
them
.
<EOS>
I
shall
certainly
not
use
them
again
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
take
the
veil
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
all
the
poor
wretch
who
have
ever
take
it
feel
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
exaggerate
evil
,
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
any
one
know
that
I
exaggerate
,
when
I
be
speak
of
my
own
feeling
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
what
any
one
else
feel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
take
out
the
torn
handkerchief
from
her
pocket
again
,
and
wrap
it
deliberately
round
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
observe
the
action
with
some
surprise
,
but
the
tone
of
her
last
word
discourage
her
from
ask
any
question
.
  
<EOS>
the
"
feeling
"
Gwendolen
speak
of
with
an
air
of
tragedy
be
not
to
be
explain
by
the
mere
fact
that
she
be
go
to
be
a
governess
:
she
be
possess
by
a
spirit
of
general
disappointment
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
simply
that
she
have
a
distaste
for
what
she
be
call
on
to
do
:
the
distaste
spread
itself
over
the
world
outside
her
penitentiary
,
since
she
see
nothing
very
pleasant
in
it
that
seem
attainable
by
her
even
if
she
be
free
.
<EOS>
naturally
her
grievance
do
not
seem
to
her
small
than
some
of
her
male
contemporary
hold
theirs
to
be
when
they
feel
a
profession
too
narrow
for
their
power
,
and
have
an
_
à
priori
_
conviction
that
it
be
not
worth
while
to
put
forth
their
latent
ability
.
<EOS>
because
her
education
have
be
less
expensive
than
theirs
,
it
do
not
follow
that
she
should
have
wide
emotion
or
a
keen
intellectual
vision
.
<EOS>
Her
griefs
be
feminine
;
but
to
her
as
a
woman
they
be
not
the
less
hard
to
bear
,
and
she
feel
an
equal
right
to
the
promethean
tone
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
movement
of
mind
which
lead
her
to
keep
the
necklace
,
to
fold
it
up
in
the
handkerchief
,
and
rise
to
put
it
in
her
_
nécessaire
_
,
where
she
have
first
place
it
when
it
have
be
return
to
her
,
be
more
peculiar
,
and
what
would
be
call
less
reasonable
.
<EOS>
It
come
from
that
streak
of
superstition
in
her
which
attach
itself
both
to
her
confidence
and
her
terror
 
<EOS>
a
superstition
which
linger
in
an
intense
personality
even
in
spite
of
theory
and
science
;
any
dread
or
hope
for
self
be
strong
than
all
reason
for
or
against
it
.
<EOS>
why
she
should
suddenly
determine
not
to
part
with
the
necklace
be
not
much
clear
to
her
than
why
she
should
sometimes
have
be
frightened
to
find
herself
in
the
field
alone
:
she
have
a
confused
state
of
emotion
about
Deronda
 
<EOS>
be
it
wound
pride
and
resentment

or
a
certain
awe
and
exceptional
trust

<EOS>
It
be
something
vague
and
yet
master
,
which
impel
her
to
this
action
about
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
deal
of
unmapped
country
within
us

would
have
to
be
take
into
account
in
an
explanation
of
our

<EOS>
how
trace
the
why
and
wherefore
in
a
mind
reduce
to
the
barrenness
of
    
a
fastidious
egoism
,
in
which
all
direct
desire
be
dull
,
and
have
    
dwindle
from
motive
into
a
vacillate
expectation
of
motive

<EOS>
a

make
up
of
mood
,
where
a
fitful
impulse
spring
here
and
there
    
conspicuously
rank
amid
the
general
weediness

<EOS>
tis
a

apt
to
    
befall
a

so
when
Grandcourt
,
after
learn
that
Gwendolen
have
leave
Leubronn
,
incidentally
pronounce
that
resort
of
fashion
a
beastly

bad
than

the
remark
be
conclusive
to
Mr.
Lush
that
his
patron
intend
straightway
to
return
to
Diplow
.
<EOS>
the
execution
be
sure
to
be
slow
than
the
intention
,
and
,
in
fact
,
Grandcourt
do
loiter
through
the
next
day
without
give
any
distinct
order
about
departure
 
perhaps
because
he
discern
that
Lush
be

them

he
linger
over
his
toilet
,
and
certainly
come
down
with
a
fade
aspect
of
perfect
distinction
which
make
fresh
complexion
and
hand
with
the
blood
in
them
,
seem
sign
of
raw
vulgarity
;

linger
on
the
terrace
,
in
the
gambling

room
,
in
the
reading
-
room
,
occupy
himself
in
be
indifferent
to
everybody
and
everything
around

<EOS>
when
he
meet
Lady
Mallinger
,
however
,
he
take
some
trouble
 
<EOS>
raise
his
hat
,
pause
,
and
prove
that
he
listen
to
her
recommendation
of
the

by
reply

yes

I

somebody

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh

that

innocent
Lady

in
imitation
of

you

"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
perhaps
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
without

of

<EOS>
Lady
Mallinger
think
this
worth
tell
to
Sir

,
who
say
,
"
oh
,
my

,
he
be
not

<EOS>
You
must
not
suppose
that
he
can
not

a

<EOS>
He
can
play
his

as
well
as
most
of

"
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
never
seem
to
me
a
very
sensible
man

"
say
Lady
Mallinger
,
in
excuse
of
herself
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
secret
objection
to
meet
Grandcourt
,
who
be
little
else
to
her
than
a
large
living
sign
of
what
she
feel
to
be
her
failure
as
a
wife
 
<EOS>
the
not
have
present
Sir
Hugo
with
a
son
.
<EOS>
Her
constant
reflection
be
that
her
husband
may
fairly
regret
his
choice
,
and
if
he
have
not
be
very
good
may
have
treat
her
with
some
roughness
in
consequence
,
gentleman
naturally
dislike
to
be
disappoint
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
,
too
,
have
a
recognition
from
Grandcourt
,
for
which
he
be
not
grateful
,
though
he
take
care
to
return
it
with
perfect
civility
.
<EOS>
no
reasoning
as
to
the
foundation
of
custom
could
do
away
with
the
early
-
root
feeling
that
his
birth
have
be
attend
with
injury
for
which
his
father
be
to
blame
;
and
see
that
<EOS>
but
for
this
injury
Grandcourt
's
prospect
may
have
be
his
,
he
be
proudly
resolute
not
to
behave
in
any
way
that
may
be
interpret
into
irritation
on
that
score
.
<EOS>
He
see
a
very
easy
descent
into
mean
unreasone
rancor
and
triumph
in
other
'
frustration
;
and
be
determine
not
to
go
down
that
ugly
pit
,
he
turn
his
back
on
it
,
cling
to
the
kindly
affection
within
him
as
a
possession
.
<EOS>
Pride
certainly
help
him
well
 
<EOS>
the
pride
of
not
recognize
a
disadvantage
for
one
's
self
<EOS>
which
vulgar
mind
be
dispose
to
exaggerate
,
such
as
the
shabby
equipage
of
poverty
:
he
would
not
have
a
man
like
Grandcourt
<EOS>
suppose
himself
envy
by
him
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
guard
against
interpretation
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
do
believe
that
Deronda
,
poor
devil
,
who
he
have
no
doubt
be
his
cousin
by
the
father
's
side
,
inwardly
wince
under
their
mutual
position
;
wherefore
the
presence
of
that
less
lucky
person
be
more
agreeable
to
him
than
it
would
otherwise
have
be
.
<EOS>
an
imaginary
envy
,
the
idea
that
other
feel
their
comparative
deficiency
,
be
the
ordinary
_
cortège
_
of
egoism
;
and
his
pet
dog
be
not
the
only
being
that
Grandcourt
like
to
feel
his
power
over
in
make
them
jealous
.
<EOS>
hence
he
be
civil
enough
to
exchange
several
word
with
Deronda
on
the
terrace
about
the
hunting
round
Diplow
,
and
even
say
,
"
You
have
better
come
over
for
a
run
or
two
when
the
season
begin
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lush
,
not
displeased
with
delay
,
amuse
himself
very
well
,
partly
in
gossip
with
Sir
Hugo
and
in
answer
his
question
about
Grandcourt
's
affair
so
far
as
they
may
affect
his
willingness
to
part
with
his
interest
in
Diplow
.
<EOS>
also
about
Grandcourt
's
personal
entanglement
,
the
baronet
know
enough
already
for
Lush
to
feel
release
from
silence
on
a
sunny
autumn
day
,
when
there
be
nothing
more
agreeable
to
do
in
lounge
promenade
than
to
speak
freely
of
a
tyrannous
patron
behind
his
back
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
willingly
incline
his
ear
to
a
little
good
-
humored
scandal
,
which
he
be
fond
of
call
_
trait
de
moeurs
_
;
but
he
be
strict
in
keep
such
communication
from
hearer
who
may
take
them
too
seriously
.
<EOS>
whatever
knowledge
he
have
of
his
nephew
's
secret
,
he
have
never
speak
of
it
to
Deronda
,
who
consider
Grandcourt
a
pale
-
blooded
mortal
,
but
be
far
from
wish
to
hear
how
the
red
corpuscle
have
be
wash
out
of
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
Lush
's
policy
and
inclination
to
gratify
everybody
when
he
have
no
reason
to
the
contrary
;
and
the
baronet
always
treat
him
well
,
as
one
of
those
easy
-
handle
personage
who
,
frequent
the
society
of
gentleman
,
without
be
exactly
gentleman
themselves
,
can
be
the
more
serviceable
,
like
the
second
-
good
article
of
our
wardrobe
,
which
we
use
with
a
comfortable
freedom
from
anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
you
will
let
me
know
the
turn
of
event
,
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
"
if
this
marriage
seem
likely
to
come
off
after
all
,
or
if
anything
else
happen
to
make
the
want
of
money
press
.
<EOS>
My
plan
would
be
much
well
for
him
than
burden
ryeland
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
,
"
say
Lush
,
"
only
it
must
not
be
urge
on
him
 
just
place
in
his
way
that
the
scent
may
tickle
him
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
be
not
a
man
to
be
always
lead
by
what
make
for
his
own
interest
;
especially
if
you
let
him
see
that
it
make
for
your
interest
too
.
<EOS>
I
be
attach
to
him
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
I
have
give
up
everything
else
for
the
sake
of
keep
by
him
,
and
it
have
last
a
good
fifteen
year
now
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
easily
get
any
one
else
to
fill
my
place
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
peculiar
character
,
be
Henleigh
Grandcourt
,
and
it
have
be
grow
on
him
of
late
year
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
be
of
a
constant
disposition
,
and
I
have
be
a
sort
of
guardian
to
him
since
he
be
twenty
;
an
uncommonly
fascinating
fellow
he
be
then
,
to
be
sure
 
and
could
be
now
,
if
he
like
.
<EOS>
I
be
attach
to
him
;
and
it
would
be
a
good
deal
bad
for
him
if
he
miss
me
at
his
elbow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
do
not
think
it
needful
to
express
his
sympathy
or
even
assent
,
and
perhaps
Lush
himself
do
not
expect
this
sketch
of
his
motive
to
be
take
as
exact
.
<EOS>
but
how
can
a
man
avoid
himself
as
a
subject
in
conversation
?
<EOS>
and
he
must
make
some
sort
of
decent
toilet
in
word
,
as
in
cloth
and
linen
.
<EOS>
Lush
's
listener
be
not
severe
:
a
member
of
Parliament
could
allow
for
the
necessity
of
verbal
toilet
;
and
the
dialogue
go
on
without
any
change
of
mutual
estimate
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
Lush
's
easy
prospect
of
indefinite
procrastination
be
cut
off
the
next
morning
by
<EOS>
Grandcourt
's
salute
him
with
the
question
    
<EOS>
"
be
you
make
all
the
arrangement
for
our
starting
by
the
Paris
train
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
you
mean
to
start
,
"
say
Lush
,
not
exactly
take
by
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
have
know
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
look
at
the
burn
length
of
his
cigar
,
and
speak
in
that
lower
tone
which
be
usual
with
him
when
he
mean
to
express
disgust
and
be
peremptory
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
just
see
to
everything
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
and
mind
no
brute
get
into
the
same
carriage
with
us
.
<EOS>
and
leave
my
P.
P.
C.
at
the
Mallingers
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
consequence
they
be
at
Paris
the
next
day
;
but
here
Lush
be
gratify
by
the
proposal
or
command
that
he
should
go
straight
on
to
Diplow
and
see
that
everything
be
right
,
while
Grandcourt
and
the
valet
remain
behind
;
and
it
be
not
until
several
day
later
that
Lush
receive
the
telegram
order
the
carriage
to
the
Wanchester
station
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
use
the
interim
actively
,
not
only
in
carry
out
Grandcourt
's
order
about
the
stud
and
household
,
but
in
learn
all
he
could
of
Gwendolen
,
and
how
thing
be
go
on
at
Offendene
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
probable
effect
that
the
news
of
the
family
misfortune
would
have
on
Grandcourt
's
fitful
obstinacy
he
feel
to
be
quite
incalculable
.
<EOS>
so
far
as
the
girl
's
poverty
may
be
an
argument
that
she
would
accept
an
offer
from
him
now
in
spite
of
any
previous
coyness
,
it
may
remove
that
bitter
objection
to
risk
a
repulse
which
Lush
divine
to
be
one
of
Grandcourt
's
deter
motive
;
on
the
other
hand
,
the
certainty
of
acceptance
be
just
"
the
sort
of
thing
"
to
make
him
lapse
hither
and
thither
with
no
more
apparent
will
than
a
moth
.
<EOS>
Lush
have
have
his
patron
under
close
observation
for
many
year
,
and
know
him
perhaps
better
than
he
know
any
other
subject
;
but
to
know
Grandcourt
be
to
doubt
what
he
would
do
in
any
particular
case
.
<EOS>
It
may
happen
that
he
would
behave
with
an
apparent
magnanimity
,
like
the
hero
of
a
modern
french
drama
,
whose
sudden
start
into
moral
splendor
after
much
lying
and
meanness
,
leave
you
little
confidence
as
to
any
part
of
his
career
that
may
follow
the
fall
of
the
curtain
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
what
attitude
would
have
be
more
honorable
for
a
final
scene
than
that
of
decline
to
seek
an
heiress
for
her
money
,
and
determine
to
marry
the
attractive
girl
who
have
none
?
<EOS>
but
Lush
have
some
general
certainty
about
Grandcourt
,
and
one
be
that
of
all
inward
movement
those
of
generosity
be
least
likely
to
occur
in
him
.
<EOS>
of
what
use
,
however
,
be
a
general
certainty
that
an
insect
will
not
walk
with
his
head
hindmost
,
when
what
you
need
to
know
be
the
play
of
inward
stimulus
that
send
him
hither
and
thither
in
a
network
of
possible
path
?
<EOS>
thus
Lush
be
much
at
fault
as
to
the
probable
issue
between
Grandcourt
and
Gwendolen
,
when
what
he
desire
be
a
perfect
confidence
that
they
would
never
be
married
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
consent
willingly
that
Grandcourt
should
marry
an
heiress
,
or
that
he
should
marry
Mrs.
Glasher
:
in
the
one
match
there
would
have
be
the
immediate
abundance
that
prospective
heirship
could
not
supply
,
in
the
other
there
would
have
be
the
security
of
the
wife
's
gratitude
,
for
Lush
have
always
be
Mrs.
Glasher
's
friend
;
and
that
the
future
Mrs.
Grandcourt
should
not
be
socially
receive
could
not
affect
his
private
comfort
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
have
minded
,
either
,
that
there
should
be
no
marriage
in
question
at
all
;
but
he
feel
himself
justified
in
do
his
utmost
to
hinder
a
marriage
with
a
girl
who
be
likely
to
bring
nothing
but
trouble
to
her
husband
 
not
to
speak
of
annoyance
if
not
ultimate
injury
to
her
husband
's
old
companion
,
whose
future
Mr.
Lush
earnestly
wish
to
make
as
easy
as
possible
,
consider
that
he
have
well
deserve
such
compensation
for
lead
a
dog
's
life
,
though
that
of
a
dog
who
enjoy
many
taste
undisturbed
,
and
who
profit
by
a
large
establishment
.
<EOS>
He
wish
for
himself
what
he
feel
to
be
good
,
and
be
not
conscious
of
wish
harm
to
any
one
else
;
unless
perhaps
it
be
just
now
a
little
harm
to
the
inconvenient
and
impertinent
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
but
the
easy
-
humor
of
luxury
and
music
,
the
toad
-
eater
the
least
liable
to
nausea
,
must
be
expect
to
have
his
susceptibility
.
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Lush
be
accustomed
to
be
treat
by
the
world
in
general
as
an
apt
,
agreeable
fellow
:
he
have
not
make
up
his
mind
to
be
insult
by
more
than
one
person
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
imperfect
preparation
of
a
war
policy
,
Lush
be
await
Grandcourt
's
arrival
,
do
little
more
than
wonder
how
the
campaign
would
begin
.
<EOS>
the
first
day
Grandcourt
be
much
occupy
with
the
stable
,
and
amongst
other
thing
he
order
a
groom
to
put
a
side
-
saddle
on
Criterion
and
let
him
review
the
horse
's
pace
.
<EOS>
this
marked
indication
of
purpose
set
Lush
on
consider
over
again
whether
he
should
incur
the
ticklish
consequence
of
speak
first
,
while
he
be
still
sure
that
no
compromise
step
have
be
take
;
and
he
rise
the
next
morning
<EOS>
almost
resolve
that
if
Grandcourt
seem
in
as
good
a
humor
as
yesterday
and
enter
at
all
into
talk
,
he
would
let
drop
the
interesting
fact
about
Gwendolen
and
her
family
,
just
to
see
how
they
would
work
,
and
to
get
some
guidance
.
<EOS>
but
Grandcourt
do
not
enter
into
talk
,
and
in
answer
to
a
question
even
about
his
own
convenience
,
no
fish
could
have
maintain
a
more
unwinking
silence
.
<EOS>
after
he
have
read
his
letter
he
give
various
order
to
be
execute
or
transmit
by
Lush
,
and
then
thrust
his
shoulder
toward
that
useful
person
,
who
accordingly
rise
to
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
but
before
he
be
out
of
the
door
Grandcourt
turn
his
head
slightly
and
give
a
broken
,
languid
"
oh
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
?
"
say
Lush
,
who
,
it
must
have
be
observe
,
do
not
take
his
dusty
pudding
with
a
respectful
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
shut
the
door
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
speak
into
the
corridor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lush
close
the
door
,
come
forward
,
and
choose
to
sit
down
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
little
pause
Grandcourt
say
,
"
be
Miss
Harleth
at
Offendene
?
"
<EOS>
He
be
quite
certain
that
Lush
have
make
it
his
business
to
inquire
about
her
,
and
he
have
some
pleasure
in
think
that
Lush
do
not
want
_
him
_
to
inquire
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
hardly
know
,
"
say
Lush
,
carelessly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
family
's
utterly
do
up
.
<EOS>
They
and
the
gascoigne
too
have
lose
all
their
money
.
<EOS>
It
be
owe
to
some
rascally
banking
business
.
<EOS>
the
poor
mother
have
not
a
_
sou
_
,
it
seem
.
<EOS>
She
and
the
girl
have
to
huddle
themselves
into
a
little
cottage
like
a
laborer
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
lie
to
me
,
if
you
please
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
in
his
low
audible
tone
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
amusing
,
and
it
answer
no
other
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
?
"
say
Lush
,
more
nettle
than
be
common
with
him
 
<EOS>
the
prospect
before
him
be
more
than
commonly
disturb
.
  
<EOS>
"
just
tell
me
the
truth
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
no
invention
of
mine
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
the
story
from
several
 
Bazley
,
Brackenshaw
's
man
,
for
one
.
<EOS>
He
be
get
a
new
tenant
for
Offendene
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
that
.
<EOS>
be
Miss
Harleth
there
,
or
be
she
not
?
"
<EOS>
say
Grandcourt
,
in
his
former
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
soul
,
I
can
not
tell
,
"
say
Lush
,
rather
sulkily
.
<EOS>
"
She
may
have
leave
yesterday
.
<EOS>
I
hear
she
have
take
a
situation
as
governess
;
she
may
be
go
to
it
for
what
I
know
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
want
to
see
her
no
doubt
the
mother
would
send
for
her
back
.
<EOS>
"
this
sneer
slip
off
his
tongue
without
strict
intention
.
  
<EOS>
"
send
Hutchins
to
inquire
whether
she
will
be
there
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
"
Lush
do
not
move
.
<EOS>
like
many
person
who
have
think
over
beforehand
what
they
shall
say
in
give
case
,
he
be
impel
by
an
unexpected
irritation
to
say
some
of
those
prearrange
thing
before
the
case
be
give
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
,
in
fact
,
be
likely
to
get
into
a
scrape
so
tremendous
that
it
be
impossible
to
let
him
take
the
first
step
toward
it
without
remonstrance
.
<EOS>
Lush
retain
enough
caution
to
use
a
tone
of
rational
friendliness
,
still
he
feel
his
own
value
to
his
patron
,
and
be
prepared
to
be
dare
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
as
well
for
you
to
remember
,
Grandcourt
,
that
you
be
come
under
close
fire
now
.
<EOS>
there
can
be
none
of
the
ordinary
flirting
do
,
which
may
mean
everything
or
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
must
make
up
your
mind
whether
you
wish
to
be
accept
;
and
more
than
that
,
how
you
would
like
be
refuse
.
<EOS>
either
one
or
the
other
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
be
philander
after
her
again
for
six
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
say
nothing
,
but
press
the
newspaper
down
on
his
knee
and
begin
to
light
another
cigar
.
<EOS>
Lush
take
this
as
a
sign
that
he
be
willing
to
listen
,
and
be
the
more
bent
on
use
the
opportunity
;
he
want
,
if
possible
,
to
find
out
which
would
be
the
more
potent
cause
of
hesitation
 
probable
acceptance
or
probable
refusal
.
  
<EOS>
"
everything
have
a
more
serious
look
now
than
it
have
before
.
<EOS>
there
be
her
family
to
be
provide
for
.
<EOS>
You
could
not
let
your
wife
's
mother
live
in
beggary
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
confoundedly
hamper
affair
.
<EOS>
marriage
will
pin
you
down
in
a
way
you
have
not
be
use
to
;
and
in
point
of
money
you
have
not
too
much
elbow
-
room
.
<EOS>
and
after
all
,
what
will
you
get
by
it
?
<EOS>
You
be
master
over
your
estate
,
present
or
future
,
<EOS>
as
far
as
choose
your
heir
go
;
it
be
a
pity
to
go
on
encumber
them
for
a
mere
whim
,
which
you
may
repent
of
in
a
twelvemonth
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
sorry
to
see
you
make
a
mess
of
your
life
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
anything
solid
to
be
gain
by
the
marriage
,
that
would
be
a
different
affair
.
<EOS>
"
  
Lush
's
tone
have
gradually
become
more
and
more
unctuous
in
its
friendliness
of
remonstrance
,
and
he
be
almost
in
danger
of
forget
that
he
be
merely
gamble
in
argument
.
<EOS>
when
he
leave
off
,
Grandcourt
take
his
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
,
and
look
steadily
at
the
moist
end
while
he
adjust
the
leaf
with
his
delicate
finger
-
tip
,
say
    
"
I
know
before
that
you
have
an
objection
to
my
marrying
Miss
Harleth
.
<EOS>
"
here
he
make
a
little
pause
before
he
continue
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
never
consider
that
a
reason
against
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
suppose
you
do
,
"
answer
Lush
,
not
unctuously
but
dryly
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
_
that
_
I
urge
as
a
reason
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
think
it
may
have
be
a
reason
against
it
,
after
all
your
experience
,
that
you
would
be
act
like
the
hero
of
a
ballad
,
and
make
yourself
absurd
 
and
all
for
what
?
<EOS>
You
know
you
could
not
make
up
your
mind
before
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
you
can
care
much
about
her
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
the
trick
she
be
likely
to
play
,
you
may
judge
of
that
from
what
you
hear
at
Leubronn
.
<EOS>
however
,
what
I
wish
to
point
out
to
you
be
,
that
there
can
be
no
shilly
-
shally
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
perfectly
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
look
round
at
Lush
and
fix
him
with
narrow
eye
;
"
I
do
not
intend
that
there
should
be
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
it
be
disagreeable
to
you
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
suppose
I
care
a
damn
for
that
you
be
most
stupendously
mistaken
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
well
,
"
say
Lush
,
rise
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
and
feel
some
latent
venom
still
within
him
,
"
if
you
have
make
up
your
mind
!
 
<EOS>
only
there
be
another
aspect
of
the
affair
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
speak
on
the
supposition
that
it
be
absolutely
certain
she
would
accept
you
,
and
that
destitution
would
have
no
choice
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
so
sure
that
the
young
lady
be
to
be
count
on
.
<EOS>
She
be
kittle
cattle
to
shoe
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
and
she
have
her
reason
for
run
away
before
.
<EOS>
"
Lush
have
move
a
step
or
two
till
he
stand
nearly
in
front
of
Grandcourt
,
though
at
some
distance
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
feel
himself
much
restrain
by
consequence
,
be
aware
that
the
only
strong
hold
he
have
on
his
present
position
be
his
serviceableness
;
and
even
after
a
quarrel
the
want
of
him
be
likely
sooner
or
later
to
recur
.
<EOS>
He
foresee
that
Gwendolen
would
cause
him
to
be
oust
for
a
time
,
and
his
temper
at
this
moment
urge
him
to
risk
a
quarrel
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
her
reason
,
"
he
repeat
more
significantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
to
that
conclusion
before
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
with
contemptuous
irony
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
but
I
hardly
think
you
know
what
her
reason
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
,
apparently
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
not
betray
by
so
much
as
an
eyelash
that
he
care
for
the
reason
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
and
you
have
better
know
too
,
that
you
may
judge
of
the
influence
you
have
over
her
if
she
swallow
her
reason
and
accept
you
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
I
would
take
odd
against
it
.
<EOS>
She
see
Lydia
in
Cardell
Chase
and
hear
the
whole
story
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
make
no
immediate
answer
,
and
only
go
on
smoking
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
long
before
he
speak
that
Lush
move
about
and
look
out
of
the
window
,
unwilling
to
go
away
without
see
some
effect
of
his
daring
move
.
<EOS>
He
have
expect
that
Grandcourt
would
tax
him
with
have
contrive
the
affair
,
since
Mrs.
Glasher
be
then
live
at
Gadsmere
,
a
hundred
mile
off
,
and
he
be
prepared
to
admit
the
fact
:
what
he
care
about
be
that
Grandcourt
should
be
stagger
by
the
sense
that
his
intend
advance
must
be
make
to
a
girl
who
have
that
knowledge
in
her
mind
and
have
be
scare
by
it
.
<EOS>
at
length
Grandcourt
,
see
Lush
turn
toward
him
,
look
at
him
again
and
say
,
contemptuously
,
"
what
follow
?
"
  
<EOS>
here
certainly
be
a
"
mate
"
in
answer
to
Lush
's
"
check
:
"
and
though
his
exasperation
with
Grandcourt
be
perhaps
strong
than
it
have
ever
be
before
,
it
would
have
be
idiocy
to
act
as
if
any
further
move
could
be
useful
.
<EOS>
He
give
a
slight
shrug
with
one
shoulder
,
and
be
go
to
walk
away
,
when
Grandcourt
,
turn
on
his
seat
toward
the
table
,
say
,
as
quietly
as
if
nothing
have
occur
,
"
oblige
me
by
push
that
pen
and
paper
here
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
no
thunderous
,
bully
superior
could
have
exercise
the
imperious
spell
that
Grandcourt
do
.
<EOS>
why
,
instead
of
be
obey
,
he
have
never
be
tell
to
go
to
a
warm
place
,
be
perhaps
a
mystery
to
those
who
find
themselves
obey
him
.
<EOS>
the
pen
and
paper
be
push
to
him
,
and
as
he
take
them
<EOS>
he
say
,
"
just
wait
for
this
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
scrawl
with
ease
,
and
the
brief
note
be
quickly
address
.
<EOS>
"
let
Hutchins
go
with
it
at
once
,
will
you
?
"
say
Grandcourt
,
push
the
letter
away
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
as
Lush
have
expect
,
it
be
address
to
Miss
Harleth
,
Offendene
.
<EOS>
when
his
irritation
have
cool
down
he
be
glad
there
have
be
no
explosive
quarrel
;
but
he
feel
sure
that
there
be
a
notch
make
against
him
,
and
that
somehow
or
other
he
be
intend
to
pay
.
<EOS>
It
be
also
clear
to
him
that
the
immediate
effect
of
his
revelation
have
be
to
harden
Grandcourt
's
previous
determination
.
<EOS>
but
as
to
the
particular
movement
that
make
this
process
in
his
baffling
mind
,
Lush
could
only
toss
up
his
chin
in
despair
of
a
theory
.
      
<EOS>
He
bring
white
ass
laden
with
the
freight
  
of
tyrian
vessel
,
purple
,
gold
and
balm
,
  
to
bribe
my
will
:
I
will
bid
them
chase
him
forth
,
  
nor
let
him
breathe
the
taint
of
his
surmise
  
<EOS>
on
my
secure
resolve
.
                         
<EOS>
ay
,
'
tis
secure
:
  
<EOS>
and
therefore
let
him
come
to
spread
his
freight
.
  
<EOS>
for
firmness
hath
its
appetite
and
crave
  
the
strong
lure
,
more
strongly
to
resist
;
  
Would
know
the
touch
of
gold
to
fle
it
off
;
  
Scent
wine
to
feel
its
lip
the
soberer
;
  
Behold
soft
byssus
,
ivory
,
and
plume
  
<EOS>
to
say
,
"
They
be
fair
,
but
I
will
none
of
them
,
"
  
and
flout
enticement
in
the
very
face
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
one
day
come
to
Offendene
with
what
he
feel
to
be
the
satisfactory
news
that
Mrs.
Mompert
have
fix
Tuesday
in
the
follow
week
for
her
interview
with
Gwendolen
at
Wanchester
.
<EOS>
He
say
nothing
of
his
have
incidentally
hear
that
Mr.
Grandcourt
have
return
to
Diplow
;
know
no
more
<EOS>
than
she
do
that
Leubronn
have
be
the
goal
of
her
admirer
's
journeying
,
and
feeling
that
it
would
be
unkind
uselessly
to
revive
the
memory
of
a
brilliant
prospect
under
the
present
reverse
.
<EOS>
in
his
secret
soul
he
think
of
his
niece
's
unintelligible
caprice
with
regret
,
but
he
vindicate
her
to
himself
by
consider
that
Grandcourt
have
be
the
first
to
behave
oddly
,
in
suddenly
walk
away
when
there
have
the
good
opportunity
for
crown
his
marked
attention
.
<EOS>
the
rector
's
practical
judgment
tell
him
that
his
chief
duty
to
his
niece
now
be
to
encourage
her
resolutely
to
face
the
change
in
her
lot
,
since
there
be
no
manifest
promise
of
any
event
that
would
avert
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
an
interest
in
varied
experience
,
my
dear
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
you
will
be
a
more
valuable
woman
for
have
sustain
such
a
part
as
you
be
call
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
pretend
to
believe
that
I
shall
like
it
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
for
the
first
time
show
her
uncle
some
petulance
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
be
quite
aware
that
I
be
oblige
to
bear
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
remember
have
submit
to
his
admonition
on
a
different
occasion
when
she
be

different
prospect

<EOS>
"
and
your
good
sense
will
teach
you
to
behave
suitably
under
it

"
say
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
with
a
shade
more
gravity

<EOS>
"
I
feel
sure
that
Mrs.
Mompert

be
pleased
with
you

You
will
know
how
to
conduct
yourself
to
a

who
hold
in
all
sense
the
relation

a
superior

you

<EOS>
this
trouble
have
come
on
you
young

but
that
make
it
in
some
respect
easy
,
and
there
be
a
benefit
in
all
chastisement
if
we
adjust
our
mind
to
it

"
  
<EOS>
this
be
precisely
what
Gwendolen
be
unable
to
do
;
and
after
her
uncle
be
go
,
the
bitter
tear
,
which
have
rarely
come
during
the
late
trouble
,
rise
and
fall
slowly
as
she
sit
alone
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
deny
that
the
trouble
be
easy
because
she
be
young
.
<EOS>
when
be
she
to
have
any
happiness
,
if
it
do
not
come
while
she
be
young
?
<EOS>
not
that
her
vision
of
possible
happiness
for
herself
be
as
unmixed
with
necessary
evil
as
they
use
to
be
 
not
that
she
could
still
imagine
herself
pluck
the
fruit
of
life
without
suspicion
of
their
core
.
<EOS>
but
this
general
disenchantment
with
the
world
 
nay
,
with
herself
,
since
it
appear
that
she
be
not
make
for
easy
pre

eminence
 
only
intensify
her
sense
of
forlornness
;
it
be
a
visibly
sterile
distance
enclose
the
dreary
path
at
her
foot
,
in
which
she
have
no
courage
to
tread
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
that
first
crisis
of
passionate
youthful
rebellion
against
what
be
not
fitly
call
pain
,
but
rather
the
absence
of
joy
 
that
first
rage
of
disappointment
in
life
's
morning
,
which
we
whom
the
year
have
subdue
be
apt
to
remember
but
dimly
as
part
of
our
own
experience
,
and
so
to
be
intolerant
of
its
self
-
enclose
unreasonableness
and
impiety
.
<EOS>
what
passion
seem
more
absurd
,
when
we
have
get
outside
it
and
look
at
calamity
as
a
collective
risk
,
than
this
amazed
anguish
that
I
and
not
Thou
,
He
or
She
,
should
be
just
the
smitten
one
?
<EOS>
yet
perhaps
some
who
have
afterward
make
themselves
a
willing
fence
before
the
breast
of
another
,
and
have
carry
their
own
heart
-
wound
in
heroic
silence
 
<EOS>
some
who
have
make
their
deed
great
,
nevertheless
begin
with
this
angry
amazement
at
their
own
smart
,
and
on
the
mere
denial
of
their
fantastic
desire
rage
as
if
under
the
sting
of
wasp
which
reduce
the
universe
for
them
to
an
unjust
infliction
of
pain

<EOS>
this
be
nearly
poor
Gwendolen
's
condition
.
<EOS>
what
though
such
a
reverse
as
her
have
often
happen
to
other
girl

<EOS>
the
one
point
she
have
be
all
her
life
learn
to
care
for
be
,
that
it
have
happen
to
_
<EOS>
her
_
:
<EOS>
it
be
what
_
<EOS>
she
_
feel
under
Klesmer
's
demonstration
that
she
be
not
remarkable
enough
to
command
fortune
by
force
of
will
and
merit
;
it
be
what
_
<EOS>
she
_
would
feel
under
the
rigor
of
Mrs.
Mompert
's
constant
expectation
,
under
the
dull
demand
that
she
should
be
cheerful
with
three
Miss
Momperts
,
under
the
necessity
of
show
herself
entirely
submissive
,
and
keep
her
thought
to
herself
.
<EOS>
to
be
a
queen
disthrone
be
not
so
hard
as
some
other
down
-
stepping
:
imagine
one
who
have
be
make
to
believe
in
his
own
divinity
find
all
homage
withdraw
,
and
himself
unable
to
perform
a
miracle
that
would
recall
the
homage
and
restore
his
own
confidence
.
<EOS>
something
akin
to
this
illusion
and
this
helplessness
have
befall
the
poor
spoiled
child
,
with
the
lovely
lip
and
eye
and
the
majestic
figure
 
which
seem
now
to
have
no
magic
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
She
rise
from
the
low
ottoman
where
she
have
be
sit
purposeless
,
and
walk
up
and
down
the
drawing
-
room
,
rest
her
elbow
on
one
palm
while
she
lean
down
her
cheek
on
the
other
,
and
a
slow
tear
fall
.
<EOS>
She
think
,
"
I
have
always
,
ever
since
I
be
little
,
feel
that
mamma
be
not
a
happy
woman
;
and
now
I
dare
say
I
shall
be
more
unhappy
than
she
have
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
mind
dwelt
for
a
few
moment
on
the
picture
of
herself
lose
her
youth
and
cease
to
enjoy
 
not
mind
whether
she
do
this
or
that
:
but
such
picturing
inevitably
bring
back
the
image
of
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
poor
mamma
!
<EOS>
it
will
be
still
bad
for
her
now

<EOS>
I
can
get
a
little
money
for
her
 
<EOS>
that
be
all
I
shall
care
about
now
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
with
an
entirely
new
movement
of
her
imagination
,
she
see
her
mother
get
quite
old
and
white
,
and
herself
no
longer
young
but
fade
,
and
their
two
face
meeting
still
with
memory
and
love
,
and
she
know
what
be
in
her
mother
's
mind
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
Gwen
too
be
sad
and
fade
now
"
 
and
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
she
sob
,
not
in
anger
,
but
with
a
sort
of
tender
misery
.
  
<EOS>
Her
face
be
toward
the
door
,
and
she
see
her
mother
enter
.
<EOS>
She
barely
see
that
;
for
her
eye
be
large
with
tear
,
and
she
press
her
handkerchief
against
them
hurriedly
.
<EOS>
before
she
take
it
away
she
feel
her
mother
's
arm
round
her
,
and
this
sensation
,
which
seem
a
prolongation
of
her
inward
vision
,
overcome
her
will
to
be
reticent
;
she
sob
anew
in
spite
of
herself
,
as
they
press
their
cheek
together
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
have
bring
something
in
her
hand
which
have
already
cause
her
an
agitate
anxiety
,
and
she
dare
not

until
her

become
calm

<EOS>
but
Gwendolen
,
with
whom
weeping

always
be
a
painful
manifestation
to
be
resist

if
possible
,
again
press
her
handkerchief
against
her
eye
,
and
,
with
a
deep
breath
,
draw
her
head
backward
and
look
at
her

who
be
pale

tremulous

<EOS>
"
It

"
It

Mrs.

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
bad

she
ask

with

touch
of
bitterness

<EOS>
"
I

"
  
"
do
not

Gwendolen

rather
impatiently

as

"
It

"
It

say
Mrs.
Davilow
,
give
her
the
letter

<EOS>
She
know
Grandcourt

indistinct

and
her
mother
be
not
surprised
to
see
her
blush
deeply
;
but
watch
her
as
she
read
,
and
wonder
much
what
be
the
purport

the
letter
<EOS>
,
she
see
the

<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
lip
even
be
pale
as
she
turn
the
open
note
toward
her
mother
.
<EOS>
the
word
be
few
and
formal
:
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Grandcourt
present
his
compliment
to
Miss
Harleth

and
beg
to
know
whether
he
may
be
permit

<EOS>
Mr.

Mrs.

<EOS>
Gwendolen
let
it
fall

"
It

timidly

Gwendolen
sink
on
the
settee

clasp
her
hand

and
look
straight
before
her

not

<EOS>
She

the
expression

one
who
have
be
startle
by
a
sound
and
be
listen
to
know
what
would
come
of
it

<EOS>
the
sudden
change

the
situation
be
bewilder

<EOS>
a
few
minute
before
she
be
look
along
an
inescapable
path
of
repulsive
monotony
,
with
hopeless
inward
rebellion
against
the
imperious
lot
which
leave
her
no
choice

and
lo

now
,
a
moment
of
choice
be
come
.
<EOS>
yet
 
be
it
triumph
<EOS>
she
feel
most
or
terror
?
<EOS>
impossible
for
Gwendolen
not
to
feel
some
triumph
in
a
tribute
to
her
power
at
a
time
when
she
be
first
taste
the
bitterness
of
insignificance
:
again
she
seem
to
be
get
a
sort
of
empire
over
her
own
life
.
<EOS>
but
how
to
use
it
?
<EOS>
here
come
the
terror

<EOS>
quick

quick

like
picture

yet
in
fragment

all
that
she
have
go
through
in
relation
to
Grandcourt
 
<EOS>
the
allurement
,
the
vacillation
,
the
resolve
to
accede
,
the
final
repulsion
;
the
incisive
face
of
that
dark
-
eyed
lady
with
the
lovely
boy
:
her
own
pledge
(
be
it
a
pledge
not
to
marry
him
?

<EOS>
the
new
disbelief
in
the
worth
of
man
and
thing
for
which
that
scene
of
disclosure
have
become
a
symbol

<EOS>
that
unalterable

before
tempering
reflection

where

<EOS>
what

<EOS>
anything
different

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
and

in
the
dark

growth

a
new

"
I

<EOS>
something

anything

<EOS>
It
be
no

it
seem
long
to
Mrs.

before

it
well

,
gently
    
"
It

close

though
with
the
assurance

remain
just
where

<EOS>
the
young
activity
within
her
make
a
warm
current
through
her
terror

stir

something

"
no

say
Mrs.
Davilow

in
the
tone
of
one
correct

turn
to
sit
down
and
take
up
a
bit
of
work
that
lie

if

it
be
what
may
have
be
subtly
calculate

<EOS>
Gwendolen
feel
a
contradictory
desire
to
be
hasten
:
hurry
would
save
her
from
deliberate
choice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
him
to

long
enough
for

needlework

she

,
lift
her

stroke
the
backward
curve
of
her
hair
,
while
she
rise
from
her
seat

stand
still

<EOS>
"
but
if
you
do
not

able

say
Mrs.
Davilow
,
sympathizingly

<EOS>
"
I

must
_
decide
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
walk
to
the
writing

table
and
seat
herself
.
<EOS>
all
the
while
there
be
a
busy
undercurrent
in
her
,
like
the
thought
of
a
man
who
keep
up
a
dialogue
while
he
be
consider
how
he
can
slip
away
.
<EOS>
why
should
she
not
let
him
come

<EOS>
It
bind
her
to
nothing

<EOS>
He
have
be
to
Leubronn
after

of

he

a

renewal
of

imply

<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
She
could
reject
him

<EOS>
why

she
to
deny

the
freedom

do
this
 
which

<EOS>
"
if
Mr.

observe
that
Gwendolen
lean
back
in

chair
after
take
the
pen
in
her
hand
 
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
he
have
hear
of

<EOS>
"
  
"
that
could
make
no
difference

a
man
in
his
position

say
Gwendolen

rather
contemptuously
,
  
"
<EOS>
It
would

some
man

say
Mrs.

.
<EOS>
"
They

<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
speak
with
unusual
emphasis
:
it
be
the
first
time
she
have
venture
to
say
anything
about
Grandcourt
which
would
necessarily
seem
intend
as
an
argument
in

her
habitual
impression
be
that
such
argument
would
certainly
be
useless
and
may
be
bad
.
<EOS>
the
effect
of
her
word
now
be
strong
than
she
could
imagine
.
<EOS>
They
raise
a
new
set
of
possibility
in
Gwendolen
's
mind
 
a
vision
of
what
Grandcourt
may
do
for
her
mother
if
she
,
Gwendolen
,
do
 
what
she
be
not
go
to
do
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
move
by
a
new
rush
of
idea
that
,
like
one
conscious
of
be
urgently
call
away
,
she
feel
that
the
immediate
task
must
be
hasten
:
the
letter
must
be
write
,
else
it
may
be
endlessly
defer
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
she
act
in
a
hurry
,
as
she
have
wish
to
do
.
<EOS>
to
act
in
a
hurry
be
to
have
a
reason
for
keep
away
from
an
absolute
decision
,
and
to
leave
open
as
many
issue
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
She
write
:
"
Miss
Harleth
present
her
compliment
to
Mr.
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
She
will
be
at
home
after
two
o'clock
to
-
morrow
.
"
  
<EOS>
before
address
the
note
she
say
,
"
pray
re
the
bell
,
mamma
,
if
there
be
any
one
to
answer
it

"
<EOS>
She
really
do
not
know
who
do
the
work
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
till
after
the
letter
have
be
take
away
and
Gwendolen
have
rise
again
,
stretch
out
one
arm
and
then
rest
it
on
her
head
,
with
a
low
moan
which
have
a
sound
of
relief
in
it
,
that
Mrs.
Davilow
venture
to
ask
    
"
what
do
you
say
,
Gwen
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
that
I
should
be
at
home
,
"
answer
Gwendolen
,
rather
loftily
.
<EOS>
then
after
a
pause
,
"
You
must
not
expect
,
because
Mr.
Grandcourt
be
come
,
that
anything
be
go
to
happen
,
mamma

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
allow
myself
to
expect
anything
,

<EOS>
I
desire
you
to
follow
your
own
feeling

<EOS>
You
have
never
tell
me
what
that
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
use
of
tell
?
"
say
Gwendolen
,
hear
a
reproach
in
that
true
statement
.
<EOS>
"
when
I
have
anything
pleasant
to
tell
,
you
may
be
sure
I
will
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
Mr.
Grandcourt
will
consider
that
you
have
already
accept
him
,
in
allow
him
to
come
.
<EOS>
His
note
tell
you
plainly
enough
that
he
be
come
to
make
you
an
offer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
;
and
I
wish
to
have
the
pleasure
of
refuse
him

"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
look
up
in
wonderment
,
but
Gwendolen
imply
her
wish
not
to
be
question
further
by
say
    
"
put
down
that
detestable
needle

work

<EOS>
Desire
have
trim
the
sail
,
and
Circumstance
  
Brings
but
the
breeze
to
fill
them
.
   
<EOS>
while
Grandcourt
on
his
beautiful
black
Yarico
,
the
groom
behind
him
on
Criterion
,
be
take
the
pleasant
ride
from
Diplow
to
Offendene
,
Gwendolen
be
seat
before
the
mirror
while
her
mother
gather
up
the
lengthy
mass
of
light
-
brown
hair
which
she
have
be
carefully
brush
.
  
<EOS>
"
only
gather
it
up
easily
and
make
a
coil

Gwendolen

<EOS>
"
let
me
bring
you
some
ear

Mrs.

,
when
the
hair
be
adjust
,
and
they
be
both
look
at
the
reflection
in
the
glass
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
them
not
to
notice
that
the
eye
look
bright
than
they
have
do
of
late
,
that
there
seem
to
be
a
shadow
lift
from
the
face
,
leave
all
the
line
once
more
in
their
placid
youthfulness
.
<EOS>
the
mother
draw
some
inference
that
make
her
voice
rather
cheerful
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
want
your
earring
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
mamma
;
I
shall
not

any
ornament

I
shall
put
on
my
black
silk

<EOS>
Black
be
the
only
wear
when
one
be
go
to
refuse
an
offer
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
with
one
of
her
old
smile
at
her
mother
,
while
she
rise
to
throw
off
her
dressing
-
gown
.
  
<EOS>
"
suppose
the
offer
be
not
make
after
all
,
"
say
Mrs.
Davilow
,
not
without
a
sly
intention
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
that
will
be
because
I
refuse
it
beforehand
,
"
say
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
It
come
to
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
proud
little
toss
of
the
head
as
she
say
this
;
and
when
she
walk
down
-
stair
in
her
long
black
robe
,
there
be
just
that
firm
poise
of
head
and
elasticity
of
form
which
have
lately
be
miss
,
as
in
a
parched
plant
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
think
,
"
She
be
quite
herself
again
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
pleasure
in
his
coming
.
<EOS>
Can
her
mind
be
really
make
up
against
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
would
have
be
rather
angry
if
that
thought
have
be
utter
;
perhaps
all
the
more
because
through
the
last
twenty
hour
,
with
a
brief
interruption
of
sleep
,
she
have
be
so
occupy
with
perpetually
alternate
image
and
argument
for
and
against
the
possibility
of
her
marry
Grandcourt
,
that
the
conclusion
which
she
have
determine
on
beforehand
cease
to
have
any
hold
on
her
consciousness
:
the
alternate
dip
of
counterbalance
thought
begotten
of
counterbalance
desire
have
bring
her
into
a
state
in
which
no
conclusion
could
look
fix
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
express
her
resolve
as
before
;
but
it
be
a
form
out
of
which
<EOS>
the
blood
have
be
suck
 
no
more
a
part
of
quiver
life
than
the
"
God
's
will
be
do
"
of
one
who
be
eagerly
watch
chance
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
mean
to
accept
Grandcourt
;
from
the
first
moment
of
receive
his
letter
she
have
mean
to
refuse
him
;
still
,
that
could
not
but
prompt
her
to
look
the
unwelcome
reason
full
in
the
face
until
she
have
a
little
less
awe
of
them
,
could
not
hinder
her
imagination
from
fill
out
her
knowledge
in
various
way
,
some
of
which
seem
to
change
the
aspect
of
what
she
know
.
<EOS>
by
dint
of
look
at
a
dubious
object
with
a
constructive
imagination
,
who
can
give
it
twenty
different
shape
.
<EOS>
Her
indistinct
ground
of
hesitation
before
the
interview
at
the
Whispering
Stones
,
at
present
count
for
nothing
;
they
be
all
merge
in
the
final
repulsion
.
<EOS>
if
it
have
not
be
for
that
day
in
Cardell
Chase
,
she
say
to
herself
now
,
there
would
have
be
no
obstacle
to
her
marry
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
on
that
day
and
after
it
,
she
have
not
reason
and
balance
;
she
have
act
with
a
force
of
impulse
against
which
all
question
be
no
more
than
a
voice
against
a
torrent
.
<EOS>
the
impulse
have
come
 
not
only
from
her
maidenly
pride
and
jealousy
,
not
only
from
the
shock
of
another
woman
's
calamity
thrust
close
on
her
vision
,
but
 
from
her
dread
of
wrong
-
doing
,
which
be
vague
,
it
be
true
,
and
aloof
from
the
daily
detail
of
her
life
,
but
not
the
less
strong
.
<EOS>
whatever
be
accept
as
consistent
with
be
a
lady
she
have
no
scruple
about
;
but
from
the
dim
region
of
what
be
call
disgraceful
,
wrong
,
guilty
,
she
shrink
with
mingled
pride
and
terror
;
and
even
apart
from
shame
,
her
feeling
would
have
make
her
place
any
deliberate
injury
of
another
in
the
region
of
guilt
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
 
do
she
know
exactly
what
be
the
state
of
the
case
with
regard
to
Mrs.
Glasher
and
her
child
?
<EOS>
She
have
give
a
sort
of
promise
 
have
say
,
"
I
will
not
interfere
with
your
wish
.
<EOS>
"
but
would
another
woman
who
marry
Grandcourt
be
in
fact
the
decisive
obstacle
to
her
wish
,
or
be
do
her
and
her
boy
any
real
injury
?
<EOS>
may
it
not
be
just
as
well
,
<EOS>
nay
better
,
that
Grandcourt
should
marry
?
<EOS>
for
what
could
not
a
woman
do
when
she
be
marry
,
if
she
know
how
to
assert
herself
?
<EOS>
here
all
be
constructive
imagination
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
have
about
as
accurate
a
conception
of
marriage
 
that
be
to
say
,
of
the
mutual
influence
,
demand
,
duty
of
man
and
woman
in
the
state
of
matrimony
 
as
she
have
of
magnetic
current
and
the
law
of
storm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mamma
manage
badly
,
"
be
her
way
of
sum
up
what
she
have
see
of
her
mother
's
experience
:
she
herself
would
manage
quite
differently
.
<EOS>
and
the
trial
of
matrimony
be
the
last
theme
into
which
Mrs.
Davilow
could
choose
to
enter
fully
with
this
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
mamma
and
my
uncle
would
say
if
they
know
about
Mrs.
Glasher
!
"
think
Gwendolen
in
her
inward
debating
;
not
that
she
could
imagine
herself
tell
them
,
even
if
she
have
not
feel
bind
to
silence
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
anybody
would
say
;
or
what
they
would
say
to
Mr.
Grandcourt
's
marry
some
one
else
and
have
other
child
!
"
<EOS>
to
consider
what
"
anybody
"
would
say
,
be
to
be
release
from
the
difficulty
of
judge
where
everything
be
obscure
to
her
when
feel
have
cease
to
be
decisive
.
<EOS>
She
have
only
to
collect
her
memory
,
which
prove
to
her
that
"
anybody
"
regard
the
illegitimate
child
as
more
rightfully
to
be
look
shy
on
and
deprive
of
social
advantage
than
illegitimate
father
.
<EOS>
the
verdict
of
"
anybody
"
seem
to
be
that
she
have
no
reason
to
concern
herself
greatly
on
behalf
of
Mrs.
Glasher
and
her
child
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
another
way
in
which
they
have
cause
her
concern
.
<EOS>
what
other
may
think
,
could
not
do
away
with
a
feeling
which
in
the
first
instance
would
hardly
be
too
strongly
describe
as
indignation
and
loathing
that
she
should
have
be
expect
to
unite
herself
with
an
outworn
life
,
full
of
backward
secret
which
must
have
be
more
keenly
feel
than
any
association
with
_
her
_
.
<EOS>
true
,
the
question
of
love
on
her
own
part
have
occupy
her
scarcely
at
all
in
relation
to
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
the
desirability
of
marriage
for
her
have
always
seem
due
to
other
feeling
than
love
;
and
to
be
enamor
<EOS>
be
the
part
of
the
man
,
on
whom
the
advance
depend
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
have
find
no
objection
to
Grandcourt
's
way
of
be
enamor
before
she
have
have
that
glimpse
of
his
past
,
which
she
resent
as
if
it
have
be
a
deliberate
offense
against
her
.
<EOS>
His
advance
to
_
her
_
be
deliberate
,
and
she
feel
a
retrospective
disgust
for
them
.
<EOS>
perhaps
other
man
's
life
be
of
the
same
kind
 
full
of
secret
which
make
the
ignorant
supposition
of
the
woman
they
want
to
marry
a
farce
at
which
they
be
laugh
in
their
sleeve
.
  
<EOS>
these
feeling
of
disgust
and
indignation
have
sink
deep
;
and
though
other
troublous
experience
in
the
last
week
have
dull
them
from
passion
into
remembrance
,
it
be
chiefly
their
reverberate
activity
which
keep
her
firm
to
the
understanding
with
herself
,
that
she
be
not
go
to
accept
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
mean
to
form
a
new
determination
;
she
have
only
be
consider
what
may
be
think
or
say
.
<EOS>
if
anything
could
have
induce
her
to
change
,
it
would
have
be
the
prospect
of
make
all
thing
easy
for
"
poor
mamma
:
"
that
,
she
admit
,
be
a
temptation
.
<EOS>
but
no
!
<EOS>
she
be
go
to
refuse
him
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
thought
that
he
be
come
to
be
refuse
be
inspirit
:
she
have
the
white
rein
in
her
hand
again
;
there
be
a
new
current
in
her
frame
,
revive
her
from
the
beaten
-
down
consciousness
in
which
she
have
be
leave
by
the
interview
with
Klesmer
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
now
go
to
crave
an
opinion
of
her
capability
;
she
be
go
to
exercise
her
power
.
  
<EOS>
be
this
what
make
her
heart
palpitate
annoyingly
when
she
hear
the
horse
's
footstep
on
the
gravel
?
 
<EOS>
when
Miss
Merry
,
who
open
the
door
to
Grandcourt
,
come
to
tell
her
that
he
be
in
the
drawing
-
room
?
<EOS>
the
hour
of
preparation
and
the
triumph
of
the
situation
be
apparently
of
no
use
:
she
may
as
well
have
see
Grandcourt
come
suddenly
on
her
in
the
midst
of
her
despondency
.
<EOS>
while
walk
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
she
have
to
concentrate
all
her
energy
in
that
self
-
control
,
which
make
her
appear
gravely
gracious
 
as
she
give
her
hand
to
him
,
and
answer
his
hope
that
she
be
quite
well
in
a
voice
as
low
and
languid
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
a
moment
afterward
,
when
they
be
both
of
them
seat
on
two
of
the
wreath
-
paint
chair
 
Gwendolen
upright
with
downcast
eyelid
,
Grandcourt
about
two
yard
distant
,
lean
one
arm
over
the
back
of
his
chair
and
look
at
her
,
while
he
hold
his
hat
in
his
left
hand
 
any
one
see
them
as
a
picture
would
have
conclude
that
they
be
in
some
stage
of
love
-
make
suspense
.
<EOS>
and
certainly
the
love
-
making
have
begin
<EOS>
:
she
already
feel
herself
be
woo
by
this
silent
man
seat
at
an
agreeable
distance
,
with
the
subtle
atmosphere
of
attar
of
rose
and
an
attention
bent
wholly
on
her
.
<EOS>
and
he
also
consider
himself
to
be
woo
:
he
be
not
a
man
to
suppose
that
his
presence
carry
no
consequence
;
and
he
be
exactly
the
man
to
feel
the
utmost
piquancy
in
a
girl
whom
he
have
not
find
quite
calculable
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
disappoint
not
to
find
you
at
Leubronn
,
"
he
begin
,
his
usual
break
drawl
have
just
a
shade
of
amorous
languor
in
it
.
"
<EOS>
the
place
be
intolerable
without
you
.
<EOS>
a
mere
kennel
of
a
place
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
judge
what
it
would
be
without
myself
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
turn
her
eye
on
him
,
with
some
recovered
sense
of
mischief
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
with
_
myself
<EOS>
I
like
it
well
enough
to

stay
longer

but
I
be
oblige
to
come
home
on
account
of
family
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
cruel
of
you
to
go
to
Leubronn
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
take
no
notice
of
the
trouble
,
on
which
Gwendolen
 
she
hardly
know
why
 
wish
that
there
should
be
a
clear
understanding
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
know
that
it
would
spoil
everything
:
you
know
you
be
the
heart
and
soul
of
everything
that
go
on
.
<EOS>
be
you
quite
reckless
about
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
impossible
to
say
"
yes
"
in
a
tone
that
would
be
take
seriously
;
equally
impossible
to
say
"
no
;
"
but
what
else
could
she
say
?
<EOS>
in
her
difficulty
,
she
turn
down
her
eyelid
again
and
blush
over
face
and
neck
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
see
her
in
a
new
phase
,
and
believe
that
she
be
show
her
inclination
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
determine
that
she
should
show
it
more
decidedly
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
there
be
some
deep
interest
?
<EOS>
some
attraction
 
<EOS>
some
engagement
 
which
it
would
have
be
only
fair
to
make
me
aware
of
?
<EOS>
be
there
any
man
who
stand
between
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
inwardly
the
answer
frame
itself
.
"
<EOS>
no
;
but
there
be
a
woman
.
"
<EOS>
yet
how
could
she
utter
this
?
<EOS>
even
if
she
have
not
promise
that
woman
to
be
silent
,
it
would
have
be
impossible
for
her
to
enter
on
the
subject
with
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
but
how
could
she
arrest
his
wooing
by
begin
to
make
a
formal
speech
 
<EOS>
"
I
perceive
your
intention
 
it
be
most
flattering
,
etc
.
"
?
<EOS>
a
fish
honestly
invite
to
come
and
be
eat
have
a
clear
course
in
declining
,
but
how
if
it
find
itself
swim
against
a
net
?
<EOS>
and
apart
from
the
network
,
would
she
have
dare
at
once
to
say
anything
decisive
?
<EOS>
Gwendolen
have
not
time
to
be
clear
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
she
feel
compel
to
silence
,
and
after
a
pause
,
Grandcourt
say
    
"
be
I
to
understand
that
some
one
else
be
prefer
?
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
now
impatient
of
her
own
embarrassment
,
determine
to
rush
at
the
difficulty
and
free
herself
.
<EOS>
She
raise
her
eye
again
and
say
with
something
of
her
former
clearness
and
defiance
,
"
no
"
 
wish
him
to
understand
,
"
<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
I
may
not
be
ready
to
take
_
<EOS>
you
_
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
that
Grandcourt
could
not
understand
which
he
perceive
likely
to
affect
his
_
amour
propre
_
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
last
thing
I
would
do
,
be
to
importune
you
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
hope
to
win
you
by
make
myself
a
bore
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
no
hope
for
me
,
I
would
ask
you
to
tell
me
so
at
once
,
that
I
may
just
ride
away
to
 
no
matter
where
.
"
  
<EOS>
almost
to
her
own
astonishment
,
Gwendolen
feel
a
sudden
alarm
at
the
image
of
Grandcourt
finally
ride
away
.
<EOS>
what
would
be
leave
her
then
?
<EOS>
nothing
but
the
former
dreariness
.
<EOS>
She
like
him
to
be
there
.
<EOS>
She
snatch
at
the
subject
that
would
defer
any
decisive
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
you
be
not
aware
of
what
have
happen
to
us
.
<EOS>
I
have
lately
have
to
think
so
much
of
my
mamma
's
trouble
,
that
other
subject
have
be
quite
throw
into
the
background
.
<EOS>
She
have
lose
all
her
fortune
,
and
we
be
go
to
leave
this
place
.
<EOS>
I
must
ask
you
to
excuse
my
seeming
preoccupied
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
elude
a
direct
appeal
Gwendolen
recover
some
of
her
self
-
possession
.
<EOS>
She
speak
with
dignity
and
look
straight
at
Grandcourt
,
whose
long
,
narrow
,
impenetrable
eye
meet
her
,
and
mysteriously
arrest
them
:
mysteriously
;
for
the
subtly
-
varied
drama
between
man
and
woman
be
often
such
as
can
hardly
be
render
in
word
put
together
like
domino
,
accord
to
obvious
fix
mark
.
<EOS>
the
word
of
all
work
,
Love
,
will
no
more
express
the
myriad
mode
of
mutual
attraction
,
than
the
word
Thought
can
inform
you
what
be
pass
through
your
neighbor
's
mind
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
hard
to
tell
on
which
side
 
Gwendolen
's
or
Grandcourt
's
 
the
influence
be
more
mixed
.
<EOS>
at
that
moment
his
strong
wish
be
to
be
completely
master
of
this
creature
 
<EOS>
this
piquant
combination
of
maidenliness
and
mischief
:
that
she
know
thing
which
have
make
her
start
away
from
him
,
spur
him
to
triumph
over
that
repugnance
;
and
he
be
believe
that
he
should
triumph
.
<EOS>
and
she
 
ah
,
piteous
equality
in
the
need
to
dominate
!
 
<EOS>
she
be
overcome
like
the
thirsty
one
who
be
draw
toward
the
seeming
water
in
the
desert
,
overcome
by
the
suffused
sense
that
here
in
this
man
's
homage
to
her
lie
the
rescue
from
helpless
subjection
to
an
oppressive
lot
.
  
<EOS>
all
the
while
they
be
look
at
each
other
;
and
Grandcourt
say
,
slowly
and
languidly
,
as
if
it
be
of
no
importance
,
other
thing
have
be
settle
    
<EOS>
"
You
will
tell
me
now
,
I
hope
,
that
Mrs.
Davilow
's
loss
of
fortune
will
not
trouble
you
further
.
<EOS>
You
will
trust
me
to
prevent
it
from
weigh
upon
her
.
<EOS>
You
will
give
me
the
claim
to
provide
against
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
little
pause
and
refined
drawling
with
which
this
speech
be
utter
,
give
time
for
Gwendolen
to
go
through
the
dream
of
a
life
.
<EOS>
as
the
word
penetrate
her
,
they
have
the
effect
of
a
draught
of
wine
,
which
suddenly
make
all
thing
easy
,
desirable
thing
not
so
wrong
,
and
people
in
general
less
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
momentary
phantasmal
love
for
this
man
who
choose
his
word
so
well
,
and
who
be
a
mere
incarnation
of
delicate
homage
.
<EOS>
repugnance
,
dread
,
scruple
 
<EOS>
these
be
dim
as
remember
pain
,
while
she
be
already
taste
relief
under
the
immediate
pain
of
hopelessness
.
<EOS>
She
imagine
herself
already
spring
to
her
mother
,
and
be
playful
again
.
<EOS>
yet
when
Grandcourt
have
cease
to
speak
,
there
be
an
instant
in
which
she
be
conscious
of
be
at
the
turning
of
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
generous
,
"
she
say
,
not
move
her
eye
,
and
speak
with
a
gentle
intonation
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
accept
what
will
make
such
thing
a
matter
of
course
?
"
say
Grandcourt
,
without
any
new
eagerness
.
<EOS>
"
You
consent
to
become
my
wife
?
"
  
<EOS>
this
time
Gwendolen
remain
quite
pale
.
<EOS>
something
make
her
rise
from
her
seat
in
spite
of
herself
and
walk
to
a
little
distance
.
<EOS>
then
she
turn
and
with
her
hand
fold
before
her
stand
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
immediately
rise
too
,
rest
his
hat
on
the
chair
,
but
still
keep
hold
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
evident
hesitation
of
this
destitute
girl
to
take
his
splendid
offer
sting
him
into
a
keenness
of
interest
such
as
he
have
not
know
for
year
.
<EOS>
none
the
less
because
he
attribute
her
hesitation
entirely
to
her
knowledge
about
Mrs.
Glasher
.
<EOS>
in
that
attitude
of
preparation
,
he
say
    
"
do
you
command
me
to
go
?
"
<EOS>
no
familiar
spirit
could
have
suggest
to
him
more
effective
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
let
him
go
:
that
negative
be
a
clutch
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
herself
to
be
,
after
all
,
only
drift
toward
the
tremendous
decision
 
but
drift
depend
on
something
besides
the
current
when
the
sail
have
be
set
beforehand
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
accept
my
devotion
?
"
say
Grandcourt
,
hold
his
hat
by
his
side
and
look
straight
into
her
eye
,
without
other
movement
.
<EOS>
Their
eye
meet
in
that
way
seem
to
allow
any
length
of
pause
:
but
wait
as
long
as
she
would
,
how
could
she
contradict
herself
!
<EOS>
what
have
she
detain
him
for
?
<EOS>
He
have
shut
out
any
explanation
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
come
as
gravely
from
Gwendolen
's
lip
as
if
she
have
be
answer
to
her
name
in
a
court
of
justice
.
<EOS>
He
receive
it
gravely
,
and
they
still
look
at
each
other
in
the
same
attitude
.
<EOS>
be
there
ever
such
a
way
before
of
accept
the
bliss
-
give
"
yes
"
?
<EOS>
Grandcourt
like
better
to
be
at
that
distance
from
her
,
and
to
feel
under
a
ceremony
impose
by
an
indefinable
prohibition
that
breathe
from
Gwendolen
's
bearing
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
do
at
length
lie
down
his
hat
and
advance
to
take
her
hand
,
just
press
his
lip
upon
it
and
let
it
go
again
.
<EOS>
She
think
his
behavior
perfect
,
and
gain
a
sense
of
freedom
which
make
her
almost
ready
to
be
mischievous
.
<EOS>
Her
"
yes
"
entail
so
little
at
this
moment
that
there
be
nothing
to
screen
the
reversal
of
her
gloomy
prospect
;
her
vision
be
fill
by
her
own
release
from
the
Momperts
,
and
her
mother
's
release
from
Sawyer
's
Cottage
.
<EOS>
with
a
happy
curl
of
the
lip
,
she
say
    
"
Will
you
not
see
mamma
?
<EOS>
I
will
fetch
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
us
wait
a
little
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
in
his
favorite
attitude
,
have
his
left
forefinger
and
thumb
in
his
waist
-
coat
pocket
,
and
with
his
right
hand
caress
his
whisker
,
while
he
stand
near
Gwendolen
and
look
at
her
 
not
unlike
a
gentleman
who
have
a
felicitous
introduction
at
an
evening
party
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
anything
else
to
say
to
me
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
playfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
 
I
know
have
thing
say
to
you
be
a
great
bore
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
rather
sympathetically
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
when
they
be
thing
I
like
to
hear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
it
bother
you
to
be
ask
how
soon
we
can
be
marry
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
will
,
to
-
day
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
put
up
her
chin
saucily
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
to
-
day
,
then
,
but
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
think
of
it
before
I
come
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
in
a
fortnight
 
or
three
week
 
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
you
think
you
will
be
tired
of
my
company
,
"
say
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
I
notice
when
people
be
marry
the
husband
be
not
so
much
with
his
wife
as
when
they
be
engage
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
I
shall
like
that
better
,
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
laugh
charmingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
whatever
you
like
,
"
say
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
nothing
that
I
do
not
like
?
 
<EOS>
please
say
that
;
because
I
think
I
dislike
what
I
do
not
like
more
than
I
like
what
I
like
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
find
herself
in
the
woman
's
paradise
,
where
all
her
nonsense
be
adorable
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
pause
;
these
be
subtiltie
in
which
he
have
much
experience
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
 
this
be
such
a
brute
of
a
world
,
thing
be
always
turn
up
that
one
do
not
like
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
always
hinder
your
be
bore
.
<EOS>
if
you
like
to
ride
criterion
,
I
can
not
hinder
his
come
down
by
some
chance
or
other

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
my
friend
Criterion
,
how
be
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
outside
:
I
make
the
groom
ride
him
,
that
you
may
see
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
side
-
saddle
on
for
an
hour
or
two
yesterday
.
<EOS>
come
to
the
window
and
look
at
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
could
see
the
two
horse
be
take
slowly
round
the
sweep
,
and
the
beautiful
creature
,
in
their
fine
grooming
,
send
a
thrill
of
exultation
through
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
They
be
the
symbol
of
command
and
luxury
,
in
delightful
contrast
with
the
ugliness
of
poverty
and
humiliation
at
which
she
have
lately
be
look
close
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
ride
criterion
to
-
morrow
?
"
say
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
,
everything
shall
be
arrange
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
it
of
all
thing
,
"
say
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
lose
myself
in
a
gallop
again
.
<EOS>
but
now
I
must
go
and
fetch
mamma
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
take
my
arm
to
the
door
,
then
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
and
she
accept
.
<EOS>
Their
face
be
very
near
each
other
,
be
almost
on
a
level
,
and
he
be
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
She
think
his
manner
as
a
lover
more
agreeable
than
any
she
have
see
describe
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
alarm
lest
he
mean
to
kiss
her
,
and
be
so
much
at
her
ease
,
that
she
suddenly
pause
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
say
half
archly
,
half
earnestly
    
"
<EOS>
oh
,
while
I
think
of
it
 
there
be
something
I
dislike
that
you
can
save
me
from
.
<EOS>
I
do
_
not
_
like
Mr.
Lush
's
company
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
have
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
get
rid
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
fond
of
him
yourself
?
"
  
"
not
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
I
let
him
hang
on
me
because
he
have
always
be
a
poor
devil
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
in
an
_
adagio
_
of
utter
indifference
.
<EOS>
"
They
get
him
to
travel
with
me
when
I
be
a
lad
.
<EOS>
He
be
always
that
coarse
-
haired
kind
of
brute
 
sort
of
cross
between
a
hog
and
a
_
dilettante
_
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
laugh
.
<EOS>
all
that
seem
kind
and
natural
enough
:
Grandcourt
's
fastidiousness
enhance
the
kindness
.
<EOS>
and
when
they
reach
the
door
,
his
way
of
open
it
for
her
be
the
perfection
of
easy

an
hour
after

at

the

My

let

congratulate
you

the

"
You
look
serious

I
do
not
wonder
at
it
:
a
lifelong
union
be
a
solemn
thing
.
<EOS>
but
from
the
way
Mr.
Grandcourt
have
act
and
speak
I
think
we
may
already
see
some
good
arise
out
of
our
adversity
.
<EOS>
It
have
give
you
an
opportunity
of
observe
your
future
husband

delicate
liberality

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
refer
to
Grandcourt
's
mode
of
imply
that
he
would
provide
for
Mrs.
Davilow
 
a
part
of
the
love
-
make
which
Gwendolen
have
remember
to
cite
to
her
mother
with
perfect
accuracy
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
have
no
doubt
that
Mr.
Grandcourt
would
have
behave
quite
as
handsomely
if
you
have
not
go
away
to
Germany
,
Gwendolen
,
and
have
be
engage
to
him
,
as
you
no

may
have
be
,
more
than
a
month
ago

"
say
Mrs.
Gascoigne
,
feel
that
she
have
to
discharge
a
duty
on
this
occasion

<EOS>
"
but
now
there
be
no
more
room
for
caprice
;
indeed
,
I
trust
you
have
no
inclination
to
any

<EOS>
a
woman
have
a
great
debt
of
gratitude
to
a
man
who
persevere
in
make
her
such
an
offer

<EOS>
but
no

you
feel
properly

<EOS>
"
I
be
not

all
sure
that
I
do

with
saucy
gravity

"
I
do
not

"
  
<EOS>
the
rector
pat
her
shoulder
and
smile
as
at
a
bit
of
innocent
naughtiness
,
and
his
wife
take
his
behavior
as
an
indication
that
she
be
not

be

as
for
Anna
,
she
kiss
Gwendolen

,

I
do
hope
you
will
be
happy

"
but
then
sink
into
the
background
and
try
to
keep
the
tear
back
too
.
<EOS>
in
the
late
day
she
have
be
imagine
a
little
romance
about
Rex
 
<EOS>
how
if
he
still
long
for
Gwendolen
her
heart
may
be
soften
by
trouble
into
love
,
so
that
they
could
by
-
and
-
by
be
married
.
<EOS>
and
the
romance
have
turn
to
a
prayer
that
she
,
Anna
,
may
be
able
to
rejoice
like
a
good
sister
,
and
only
think
of
be
useful
in
work
for
Gwendolen
,
as
long
as
Rex
be
not
rich
.
<EOS>
but
now
she
want
grace
to
rejoice
in
something
else

<EOS>
Miss
Merry

the
four
girl

Alice
with

high

,
Bertha
and
Fanny

whisperer

and
Isabel

all
present
on
this
family
occasion
,
when
everything
seem
appropriately

to
the
honor
and
glory
of
Gwendolen

and
real
life
be
as
interesting
as
"
Sir

<EOS>
"
the
evening
pass
chiefly
in
decisive
remark
from
the
rector
,
in
answer
to
conjecture
from
the
two
eld
lady
.
<EOS>
accord
to
him
,
the
case
be
not
one
in
which
he
could
think
it
his
duty
to
mention
settlement
:
everything
must
,
and
doubtless
would
safely
be
leave
to
Mr.
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
know
exactly
what
sort
of
place
<EOS>
ryeland
and
Gadsmere
be
,
"
say
Mrs.
Davilow
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gadsmere
,
I
believe
,
be
a
secondary
place
,
"
say
Mr.
Gascoigne
;
"
but
<EOS>
ryeland
I
know
to
be
one
of
our
fine
seat
.
<EOS>
the
park
be
extensive
and
the
wood
of
a
very
valuable
order
.
<EOS>
the
house
be
build
by
Inigo
Jones
,
and
the
ceiling
be
paint
in
the
italian
style
.
<EOS>
the
estate
be
say
to
be
worth
twelve
thousand
a
year
,
and
there
be
two
living
,
one
a
rectory
,
in
the
gift
of
the
Grandcourts
.
<EOS>
there
may
be
some
burden
on
the
land
.
<EOS>
still
,
Mr.
Grandcourt
be
an
only
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
most
remarkable
,
"
say
Mrs.
Gascoigne
,
"
if
he
be
to
become
Lord
Stannery
in
addition
to
everything
else
.
<EOS>
only
think
:
there
be
the
Grandcourt
estate
,
the
mallinger
estate
,
_
and
_
the
baronetcy
,
_
and
_
<EOS>
the
peerage
,
"
 
<EOS>
she
be
mark
off
the
item
on
her
finger
,
and
pause
on
the
fourth
while
she
add
,
"
but
they
say
there
will
be
no
land
come
to
him
with
the
peerage
.
<EOS>
"
It
seem
a
pity
there
be
nothing
for
the
fifth
finger
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
peerage
,
"
say
the
rector
,
judiciously
,
"
must
be
regard
as
a
remote
chance
.
<EOS>
there
be
two
cousin
between
the
present
peer
and
Mr.
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
a
serious
reflection
how
death
and
other
cause
do
sometimes
concentrate
inheritance
on
one
man
.
<EOS>
but
an
excess
of
that
kind
be
to
be
deprecate
.
<EOS>
to
be
Sir
Mallinger
Grandcourt
Mallinger
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
that
will
be
his
style
 
with
corresponding
property
,
be
a
valuable
talent
enough
for
any
man
to
have
commit
to
him
.
<EOS>
let
us
hope
it
will
be
well
use
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
a
position
for
the
wife
,
Gwendolen
!
"
say
Mrs.
Gascoigne
;
"
a
great
responsibility
indeed
.
<EOS>
but
you
must
lose
no
time
in
writing
to
Mrs.
Mompert
,
Henry
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
good
thing
that
you
have
an
engagement
of
marriage
to
offer
as
an
excuse
,
else
she
may
feel
offended
.
<EOS>
She
be
rather
a
high
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
rid
of
that
horror
,
"
think
Gwendolen
,
to
whom
the
name
of
Mompert
have
become
a
sort
of
mumbo
-
jumbo
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
silent
through
the
evening
,
and
that
night
could
hardly
sleep
at
all
in
her
little
white
bed
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
rarity
in
her
strong
youth
to
be
wakeful
:
and
perhaps
a
still
great
rarity
for
her
to
be
careful
that
her
mother
should
not
know
of
her
restlessness
.
<EOS>
but
her
state
of
mind
be
altogether
new
:
she
who
have
be
use
to
feel
sure
of
herself
,
and
ready
to
manage
other
,
have
just
take
a
decisive
step
which
she
have
beforehand
think
that
she
would
not
take
 
nay
,
<EOS>
perhaps
,
be
bind
not
to
take
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
go
backward
now
;
she
like
a
great
deal
of
what
lie
before
her
;
and
there
be
nothing
for
her
to
like
if
she
go
back
.
<EOS>
but
her
resolution
be
dog
by
the
shadow
of
that
previous
resolve
which
have
at
first
come
as
the
undoubte
movement
of
her
whole
being
.
<EOS>
while
she
lie
on
her
pillow
with
wide
-
open
eye
,
"
look
on
darkness
which
the
blind
do
see
,
"
she
be
appal
by
the
idea
that
she
be
go
to
do
what
she
have
once
start
away
from
with
repugnance
.
<EOS>
It
be
new
to
her
that
a
question
of
right
or
wrong
in
her
conduct
should
rouse
her
terror
;
she
have
know
no
compunction
that
atone
caress
and
present
could
not
lay
to
rest
.
<EOS>
but
here
have
come
a
moment
when
something
like
a
new
consciousness
be
awake
.
<EOS>
She
seem
on
the
edge
of
adopt
deliberately
,
as
a
notion
for
all
the
rest
of
her
life
,
what
she
have
rashly
say
in
her
bitterness
,
when
her
discovery
have
drive
her
away
to
Leubronn
:
 
that
it
do
not
signify
what
she
do
;
she
have
only
to
amuse
herself
as
best
she
could
.
<EOS>
that
lawlessness
,
that
cast
away
of
all
care
for
justification
,
suddenly
frighten
her
:
it
come
to
her
with
the
shadowy
array
of
possible
calamity
behind
it
 
calamity
which
have
cease
to
be
a
mere
name
for
her
;
and
all
the
infiltrated
influence
of
disregard
religious
teaching
,
as
well
as
the
deep
impression
of
something
awful
and
inexorable
envelop
her
,
seem
to
concentrate
themselves
in
the
vague
conception
of
avenge
power
.
<EOS>
the
brilliant
position
she
have
long
for
,
the
imagine
freedom
she
would
create
for
herself
in
marriage
,
the
deliverance
from
the
dull
insignificance
of
her
girlhood
 
all
immediately
before
her
;
and
yet
they
have
come
to
her
hunger
like
food
with
the
taint
of
sacrilege
upon
it
,
which
she
must
snatch
with
terror
.
<EOS>
in
the
darkness
and
loneliness
of
her
little
bed
,
her
more
resistant
self
could
not
act
against
the
first
onslaught
of
dread
after
her
irrevocable
decision
.
<EOS>
that
unhappy
-
face
woman
and
her
child
 
Grandcourt
and
his
relation
with
her
 
keep
repeat
themselves
in
her
imagination
like
the
cling
memory
of
a
disgrace
,
and
gradually
obliterate
all
other
thought
,
leave
only
the
consciousness
that
she
have
take
those
scene
into
her
life
.
<EOS>
Her
long
wakefulness
seem
a
delirium
;
a
faint
,
faint
light
penetrate
beside
the
window
-
curtain
;
the
chillness
increase
.
<EOS>
She
could
bear
it
no
longer
,
and
cry
"
Mamma
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
dear
,
"
say
Mrs.
Davilow
,
immediately
,
in
a
wakeful
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
come
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
soon
go
to
sleep
on
her
mother
's
shoulder
,
and
sleep
on
till
late
,
when
,
dream
of
a
light
-
up
ball
-
room
,
she
open
her
eye
on
her
mother
stand
by
the
bedside
with
a
small
packet
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
to
wake
you
,
darle
,
but
I
think
it
better
to
give
you
this
at
once
.
<EOS>
the
groom
have
bring
Criterion
;
he
have
come
on
another
horse
,
and
say
he
be
to
stay
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
sit
up
in
bed
and
open
the
packet
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
delicate
enamel
casket
,
and
inside
be
a
splendid
diamond
ring
with
a
letter
which
contain
a
fold
bit
of
colored
paper
and
these
word
:
        
<EOS>
Pray
wear
this
ring
when
I
come
at
twelve
in
sign
of
our
betrothal
.
<EOS>
I
    
enclose
a
check
draw
in
the
name
of
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
for
immediate
    
expense
.
<EOS>
of
course
Mrs.
Davilow
will
remain
at
Offendene
,
at
least
    
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
when
I
come
,
you
will
have
grant
me
an
early
    
day
,
when
you
may
begin
to
command
me
at
a
short
distance
.
      
<EOS>
yours
devotedly

H.
M.
GRANDCOURT

<EOS>
the
check
be
for
five
hundred
pound
,
and
Gwendolen
turn
it
toward
her
mother
,
with
the
letter
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
very
kind
and
delicate
!
"
say
Mrs.
Davilow
,
with
much
feeling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
I
really
should
like
well
not
to
be
dependent
on
a
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
I
and
the
girl
could
get
along
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mamma
,
if
you
say
that
again
,
I
will
not
marry
him
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
angrily
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
child
,
I
trust
you
be
not
go
to
marry
only
for
my
sake
,
"
say
Mrs.
Davilow
,
depreciatingly
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
toss
her
head
on
the
pillow
away
from
her
mother
,
and
let
the
ring
lie
.
<EOS>
She
be
irritated
at
this
attempt
to
take
away
a
motive
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
deep
cause
of
her
irritation
be
the
consciousness
that
she
be
not
go
to
marry
solely
for
her
mamma
's
sake
 
that
she
be
draw
toward
the
marriage
in
way
<EOS>
against
which
strong
reason
than
her
mother
's
renunciation
be
yet
not
strong
enough
to
hinder
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
wake
up
to
the
sign
that
she
be
irrevocably
engage
,
and
all
the
ugly
vision
,
the
alarm
,
the
argument
of
the
night
,
must
be
meet
by
daylight
,
in
which
probably
they
would
show
themselves
weak
.
<EOS>
"
what
I
long
for
be
your
happiness
,
dear
,
"
continue
Mrs.
Davilow
,
pleadingly
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
say
anything
to
vex
you
.
<EOS>
Will
you
not
put
on
the
ring
?
"
  
<EOS>
for
a
few
moment
Gwendolen
do
not
answer
,
but
her
thought
be
active
.
<EOS>
at
last
she
raise
herself
with
a
determination
to
do
as
she
would
do
if
she
have
start
on
horseback
,
and
go
on
with
spirit
,
whatever
idea
may
be
run
in
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
the
lover
always
put
on
the
betrothal
re
himself
,
"
she
say
laughingly
,
slip
the
ring
on
her
finger
,
and
look
at
it
with
a
charming
movement
of
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
why
he
have
send
it
,
"
she
add
,
nod
at
her
mamma
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
?
"
  
<EOS>

He
would
rather
make
me
put
it
on
than
ask
me
to
let
him
do
it

<EOS>
aha
!
<EOS>
he
be
very
proud

<EOS>
but
so
be
I.
<EOS>
We
shall
match
each
other

I
should
hate
a
man
who
go
down
on
his
knee
,
and
come
fawn
on
me
.
<EOS>
He
really
be
not
disgusting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
very
moderate
praise
,
Gwen
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
it
be
not
,
for
a
man
,
"
say
Gwendolen
gaily
.
<EOS>
"
but
now
I
must
get
up
and
dress
.
<EOS>
Will
you
come
and
do
my
hair
,
mamma
,
dear
,
"
she
go
on
,
draw
down
her
mamma
's
face
to
caress
it
with
her
own
cheek
,
"
and
not
be
so
naughty
any
more
as
to
talk
of
living
in
poverty
?
<EOS>
You
must
bear
to
be
make
comfortable
,
even
if
you
do
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Grandcourt
behave
perfectly
,
now
,
do
he
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
he
do
,
"
say
Mrs.
Davilow
,
encourage
,
and
persuade
that
after
all
Gwendolen
be
fond
of
her
betroth
.
<EOS>
She
herself
think
him
a
man
whose
attention
be
likely
to
tell
on
a
girl
's
feeling
.
<EOS>
suitor
must
often
be
judge
as
word
be
,
by
the
standing
and
the
figure
they
make
in
polite
society
:
it
be
difficult
to
know
much
else
of
them
.
<EOS>
and
all
the
mother
's
anxiety
turn
not
on
Grandcourt
's
character
,
but
on
Gwendolen
's
mood
in
accept
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
mood
be
necessarily
pass
through
a
new
phase
this
morning
.
<EOS>
even
in
the
hour
of
make
her
toilet
,
she
have
draw
on
all
the
knowledge
she
have
for
ground
to
justify
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
and
what
she
most
dwelt
on
be
the
determination
,
that
when
she
be
Grandcourt
's
wife
,
she
would
urge
him
to
the
most
liberal
conduct
toward
Mrs.
Glasher
's
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
what
use
would
it
be
to
her
that
I
should
not
marry
him
?
<EOS>
He
could
have
marry
her
if
he
like
;
but
he
do
_
<EOS>
not
_
like
.
<EOS>
perhaps
she
be
to
blame
for
that
.
<EOS>
there
must
be
a
great
deal
about
her
that
I
know
nothing
of
.
<EOS>
and
he
must
have
be
good
to
her
in
many
way
,
else
she
would
not
have
want
to
marry
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
that
last
argument
at
once
begin
to
appear
doubtful
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glasher
naturally
wish
to
exclude
other
child
who
would
stand
between
Grandcourt
and
her
own
:
and
Gwendolen
's
comprehension
of
this
feeling
prompt
another
way
of
reconcile
claim
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
we
shall
have
no
child
.
<EOS>
I
hope
we
shall
not
.
<EOS>
and
he
may
leave
the
estate
to
the
pretty
little
boy
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
say
that
Mr.
Grandcourt
could
do
as
he
like
with
the
estate
.
<EOS>
only
when
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
die
there
will
be
enough
for
two
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
make
Mrs.
Glasher
appear
quite
unreasonable
in
demand
that
her
boy
should
be
sole
heir
;
and
the
double
property
be
a
security
that
Grandcourt
's
marriage
would
do
her
no
wrong
,
when
the
wife
be
Gwendolen
Harleth
with
all
her
proud
resolution
not
to
be
fairly
accuse
.
<EOS>
this
maiden
have
be
accustom
to
think
herself
blameless
;
other
person
only
be
faulty
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
strike
,
that
in
the
hold
which
this
argument
of
her
do
no
wrong
to
Mrs.
Glasher
have
take
on
her
mind
,
her
repugnance
to
the
idea
of
Grandcourt
's
past
have
sink
into
a
subordinate
feeling
.
<EOS>
the
terror
she
have
feel
in
the
night
-
watch
at
overstep
the
border
of
wickedness
by
do
what
she
have
at
first
feel
to
be
wrong
,
have
dull
any
emotion
about
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
She
be
think
of
him
,
whatever
he
may
be
,
as
a
man
over
whom
she
be
go
to
have
indefinite
power
;
and
her
love
him
have
never
be
a
question
with
her
,
any
agreeableness
he
have
be
so
much
gain
.
<EOS>
poor
Gwendolen
have
no
awe
of
unmanageable
force
in
the
state
of
matrimony
,
but
regard
it
as
altogether
a
matter
of
management
,
in
which
she
would
know
how
to
act
.
<EOS>
in
relation
to
Grandcourt
's
past
she
encourage
new
doubt
whether
he
be
likely
to
have
differ
much
from
other
man
;
and
she
devise
little
scheme
for
learn
what
be
expect
of
man
in
general
.
  
<EOS>
but
whatever
else
may
be
true
in
the
world
,
her
hair
be
dress
suitably
for
ride
,
and
she
go
down
in
her
riding
-
habit
,
to
avoid
delay
before
get
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
She
want
to
have
her
blood
stir
once
more
with
the
intoxication
of
youth
,
and
to
recover
the
daring
with
which
she
have
be
use
to
think
of
her
course
in
life
.
<EOS>
already
a
load
be
lift
off
her
;
for
in
daylight
and
activity
it
be
less
oppressive
to
have
doubt
about
her
choice
,
than
to
feel
that
she
have
no
choice
but
to
endure
insignificance
and
servitude
.
  
<EOS>
"
go
back
and
make
yourself
look
like
a
duchess
,
mamma
,

she
say
,
turn
suddenly

she

down

your

you

<EOS>
You
must
not
take
thing
humbly

"
  
<EOS>
when
Grandcourt
raise
her
left
hand
gently
and
look
at
the
ring
,
she
say
gravely
,
"
It
be
very
good
of

his

<EOS>
"
I
will
do
anything
you

I

Gwendolen

<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
expect
that

<EOS>
woman
always

"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
not

unreasonable

say
Gwendolen
,
take
away
her
hand
and
toss
her
head
saucily
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not

that
I

always
be

<EOS>
"
I
do
not

Grandcourt
,
look
at
her
with
his
usual
gravity

"
You
be
what
no

<EOS>

what

say
Gwendolen
,
move
to
a
distance
with
a
little
air
of
menace
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
make
his
pause
before
he
answer
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
the
woman
I
love
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
what
nice
speech
!
"
say
Gwendolen
,
laugh
.
<EOS>
the
sense
of
that
love
which
he
must
once
have
give
to
another
woman
under
strange
circumstance

get
familiar

<EOS>
"
give
me
a
nice

"
not
yet
.
<EOS>
not
till
we
have
have
a
gallop
over
the
down
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
thirsty
for
that
,
I
can
think
of
nothing
else

<EOS>
I
wish
the
hunting
have
begin

<EOS>
Sunday

<EOS>
"
Gwendolen
be
count
on
her
finger
with
the
prettiest
nod
while
she
look
at
Grandcourt
,
and
at
last
sweep
one
palm
over
the
other
while
she
say
triumphantly
,
"
It
will
begin
in
ten
day
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
us
be
marry
in
ten
day
,
then
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
"
and
we
shall
not
be
bore
about
the
stable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
woman
always
say
in
answer
to
that
?
"
say
Gwendolen
,
mischievously
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
agree
to
it

"
say
the
lover
,
rather
off
his
guard
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
not
!
"
<EOS>
say
Gwendolen
,
take
up
her
gauntlet
and
put
them
on
,
while
she
keep
her
eye
on
him
with
gather
fun
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
scene
be
pleasant
on
both
side
.
<EOS>
a
cruder
lover
would
have
lose
the
view
of
her
pretty
way
and
attitude
,
and
spoil
all
by
stupid
attempt
at
caress
,
utterly
destructive
of
drama
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
prefer
the
drama
;
and
Gwendolen
,
leave
at
ease
,
find
her
spirit
rise
continually
as
she
play
at
reign
.
<EOS>
perhaps
if
Klesmer
have
see
more
of
her
in
this
unconscious
kind
of
acting
,
instead
of
when
she
be
try
to
be
theatrical
,
he
may
have
rate
her
chance
higher
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
have
have
a
glorious
gallop
,
however
,
she
be
in
a
state
of
exhilaration
that
dispose
her
to
think
well
of
hasten
the
marriage
which
would
make
her
life
all
of
apiece
with
this
splendid
kind
of
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
debate
any
more
about
an
act
to
which
she
have
commit
herself
;
and
she
consent
to
fix
the
wedding
on
that
day
three
week
,
notwithstanding
the
difficulty
of
fulfil
the
customary
law
of
the
_
trousseau
_
.
  
<EOS>
Lush
,
of
course
,
be
make
aware
of
the
engagement
by
abundant
sign
,
without
be
formally
tell
.
<EOS>
but
he
expect
some
communication
as
a
consequence
of
it
,
and
after
a
few
day
he
become
rather
impatient
under
Grandcourt
's
silence
,
feel
sure
that
the
change
would
affect
his
personal
prospect
,
and
wish
to
know
exactly
how
.
<EOS>
His
tactic
no
longer
include
any
opposition
 
which
he
do
not
love
for
its
own
sake
.
<EOS>
He
may
easily
cause
Grandcourt
a
great
deal
of
annoyance
,
but
it
would
be
to
his
own
injury
,
and
to
create
annoyance
be
not
a
motive
with
him
.
<EOS>
Miss
Gwendolen
he
would
certainly
not
have
be
sorry
to
frustrate
a
little
,
but
 
after
all
there
be
no
knowing
what
would
come
.
<EOS>
It
be
nothing
new
that
Grandcourt
should
show
a
perverse
wilfulness
;
yet
in
his
freak
about
this
girl
he
strike
Lush
rather
newly
as
something
like
a
man
who
be
<EOS>
_
fey
<EOS>
_
 
lead
on
by
an
ominous
fatality
;
and
that
one
bear
to
his
fortune
should
make
a
bad
business
of
his
life
than
be
necessary
,
seem
really
pitiable
.
<EOS>
have
protest
against
the
marriage
,
Lush
have
a
second

sight
for
its
evil
consequence
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
have
be
take
the
pain
to
write
letter
and
give
order
himself
instead
of
employ
Lush
,
and
appear
to
be
ignore
his
usefulness
,
even
choose
,
against
the
habit
of
year
,
to
breakfast
alone
in
his
dressing

but
a

tete

be
not
to
be
avoid
in
a
house
empty
of
guest
;
and
Lush
hasten
to
use
an
opportunity
of
say
 
it
be
one
day
after
dinner
,
for
there
be
difficulty
in
Grandcourt
's
dining
at
Offendene
    
"
<EOS>
and
when
be
the
marriage
to
take
place
?
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
,
who
drink
little
wine
,
have
leave
the
table
and
be
lounge
,
while
he
smoke
,
in
an
easy
chair
near
the
hearth
,
where
a
fire
of
oak
bough
be
gape
to
its
glowing
depth
,
and
edge
them
with
a
delicate
tint
of

delightful

the
chair
of
red

brown
velvet
brocade
be
a
become
back

ground
for
his
pale

tint
,
well
-
cut
feature
and
exquisite
long
hand
.
<EOS>
omit
the
cigar
,
you
may
have
imagine
him
a
portrait
by
Moroni
,
who
would
have
render
wonderfully
the
impenetrable
gaze
and
air
of
distinction
;
and
<EOS>
a
portrait
by
that
great
master
would
have
be
quite
as
lively
a
companion
as
Grandcourt
be
dispose
to
be
.

he
answer
without
unusual
delay

after
this
word
there
be
the
languid
inarticulate
sound
frequent
with
Grandcourt
when

mean
to
continue
speak

Lush

for
something
more

nothing

he
be
go
to
put
another
question
,
when
the
inarticulate
sound
begin
again

introduce
the
mildly
uttered
suggestion

You

you

of
that

<EOS>
"

just
leave
me
alone

"
say
Grandcourt
,
in
his
low
audible
tone
,
toss
his
cigar
into
the
fire
,
and
rise
to
walk
away
.
  
<EOS>
He
spend
the
evening
in
the
solitude
of
the
small
drawing
-
room
,
where
,
with
various
new
publication
on
the
table
of
the
kind
a
gentleman
may
like
to
have
on
hand
without
touch
,
he
employ
himself
(
as
a
philosopher
may
have
do
)
in
sit
meditatively
on
the
sofa
and
abstain
from
literature
 
political
,
comic
,
cynical
,
or
romantic
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
hour
may
pass
surprisingly
soon
,
without
the
arduous
invisible
chase
of
philosophy
;
not
from
love
of
thought
,
but
from
hatred
of
effort
 
from
a
state
of
the
inward
world
,
something
like
premature
age
,
where
the
need
for
action
lapse
into
a
mere
image
of
what
have
be
,
be
,
and
may
or
may
be
;
where
impulse
be
bear
and
die
in
a
phantasmal
world
,
pause
in
rejection
of
even
a
shadowy
fulfillment
.
<EOS>
that
be
a
condition
which
often
come
with
whiten
hair
;
and
sometimes
,
too
,
an
intense
obstinacy
and
tenacity
of
rule
,
like
the
main
trunk
of
an
exorbitant
egoism
,
conspicuous
in
proportion
as
the
varied
susceptibility
of
young
year
be
strip
away
.
  
<EOS>
but
Grandcourt
's
hair
,
though
he
have
not
much
of
it
,
be
of
a
fine
,
sunny
blonde
,
and
his
mood
be
not
entirely
to
be
explain
as
ebb
energy
.
<EOS>
We
mortal
have
a
strange
spiritual
chemistry
go
on
within
us
,
so
that
a
lazy
stagnation
or
even
a
cottony
milkiness
may
be
prepare
one
<EOS>
know
not
what
biting
or
explosive
material
.
<EOS>
the
navvy
wake
from
sleep
and
without
malice
heave
a
stone
to
crush
the
life
out
of
his
still
sleep
comrade
,
be
understand
to
lack
the
train
motive
which
make
a
character
fairly
calculable
in
its
action
;
but
by
a
roundabout
course
even
a
gentleman
may
make
of
himself
a
chancy
personage
,
raise
an
uncertainty
as
to
what
he
may
do
next
,
that
sadly
spoil
companionship
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
's
thought
this
evening
be
like
the
circlet
one
see
in
a
dark
pool
,
continually
die
out
and
continually
start
again
by
some
impulse
from
below
the
surface
.
<EOS>
the
deep
central
impulse
come
from
the
image
of
Gwendolen
;
but
the
thought
it
stir
would
be
imperfectly
illustrate
by
a
reference
to
the
amatory
poet
of
all
age
.
<EOS>
It
be
characteristic
that
he
get
none
of
his
satisfaction
from
the
belief
that
Gwendolen
be
in
love
with
him
;
and
that
love
have
overcome
the
jealous
resentment
which
have
make
her
run
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
he
believe
that
this
girl
be
rather
exceptional
in
the
fact
that
,
in
spite
of
his
assiduous
attention
to
her
,
she
be
not
in
love
with
him
;
and
it
seem
to
him
very
likely
that
if
it
have
not
be
for
the
sudden
poverty
which
have
come
over
her
family
,
she
would
not
have
accept
him
.
<EOS>
from
the
very
first
there
have
be
an
exasperating
fascination
in
the
tricksiness
with
which
she
have
 
not
meet
his
advance
,
but
 
wheel
away
from
them
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
bring
to
accept
him
in
spite
of
everything
 
bring
to
kneel
down
like
a
horse
under
training
for
the
arena
,
though
she
may
have
an
objection
to
it
all
the
while
.
<EOS>
on
the
whole
,
Grandcourt
get
more
pleasure
out
of
this
notion
than
he
could
have
do
out
of
win
a
girl
of
whom
he
be
sure
that
she
have
a
strong
inclination
for
him
personally
.
<EOS>
and
yet
this
pleasure
in
master
reluctance
flourish
along
with
the
habitual
persuasion
that
no
woman
whom
he
favor
could
be
quite
indifferent
to
his
personal
influence
;
and
it
seem
to
him
not
unlikely
that
by
-
and
-
by
Gwendolen
may
be
more
enamored
of
him
than
he
of
her
.
<EOS>
in
any
case
,
she
would
have
to
submit
;
and
he
enjoy
think
of
her
as
his
future
wife
,
whose
pride
and
spirit
be
suit
to
command
every
one
but
himself
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
taste
for
a
woman
who
be
all
tenderness
to
him
,
full
of
petition
solicitude
and
willing
obedience
.
<EOS>
He
mean
to
be
master
of
a
woman
who
would
have
like
to
master
him
,
and
who
perhaps
would
have
be
capable
of
master
another
man
.
  
<EOS>
Lush
,
have
fail
in
his
attempt
reminder
to
Grandcourt
,
think
it
well
to
communicate
with
Sir
Hugo
,
in
whom
,
as
a
man
have
perhaps
interest
enough
to
command
the
bestowal
of
some
place
where
the
work
be
light
,
gentlemanly
,
and
not
ill
-
pay
,
he
be
anxious
to
cultivate
a
sense
of
friendly
obligation
,
not
feel
at
all
secure
against
the
future
need
of
such
a
place
.
<EOS>
He
write
the
follow
letter
,
and
address
it
to
Park
Lane
,
whither
he
know
the
family
have
return
from
Leubronn
:
        
my
dear
SIR
HUGO
 
<EOS>
since
we
come
home
the
marriage
have
be
absolutely
    
decide
on
,
and
be
to
take
place
in
less
than
three
week
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
    
far
the
bad
for
him
that
her
mother
have
lately
lose
all
her
fortune
,
    
and
he
will
have
to
find
supply
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
,
I
know
,
be
feel
the
    
want
of
cash
;
and
unless
some
other
plan
be
resort
to
,
he
will
be
    
raise
money
in
a
foolish
way
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
leave
Diplow
    
immediately
,
and
I
shall
not
be
able
to
start
the
topic
.
<EOS>
what
I
should
    
<EOS>
advise
be
,
that
Mr.
Deronda
,
who
I
know
have
your
confidence
,
should
    
propose
to
come
and
pay
a
short
visit
here
,
accord
to
invitation
    
(
there
be
go
to
be
other
people
in
the
house
)
,
and
that
you
should
    
put
him
fully
in
possession
of
your
wish
and
the
possible
extent
of
    
your
offer
.
<EOS>
then
,
that
he
should
introduce
the
subject
to
Grandcourt
    
<EOS>
so
as
not
to
imply
that
you
suspect
any
particular
want
of
money
on
    
his
part
,
but
only
that
there
be
a
strong
wish
on
your
<EOS>
,
what
I
have
    
formerly
say
to
him
have
be
in
the
way
of
a
conjecture
that
you
    
may
be
willing
to
give
a
good
sum
for
his
chance
of
Diplow
;
but
if
    
Mr.
Deronda
come
armed
with
a
definite
offer
,
that
would
take
another
    
sort
of
hold
.
<EOS>
ten
to
one
he
will
not
close
for
some
time
to
come
;
but
    
the
proposal
will
have
get
a
strong
lodgment
in
his
mind
;
and
though
    
at
present
he
have
a
great
notion
of
the
hunting
here
,
I
see
a
    
likelihood
,
under
the
circumstance
,
that
he
will
get
a
distaste
for
    
the
neighborhood
,
and
there
will
be
the
notion
of
the
money
stick
    
by
him
without
be
urge
.
<EOS>
I
would
bet
on
your
ultimate
success
.
<EOS>
as
I
    
be
not
to
be
exile
to
Siberia
,
but
be
to
be
within
call
,
it
be
    
possible
that
,
by
and
by
,
I
may
be
of
more
service
to
you
.
<EOS>
but
at
    
present
I
can
think
of
no
medium
so
good
as
Mr.
Deronda
.
<EOS>
nothing
put
    
Grandcourt
in
bad
humor
than
have
the
lawyer
thrust
their
paper
    
under
his
nose
uninvited
.
      
<EOS>
trust
that
your
visit
to
Leubronn
have
put
you
in
excellent
    
condition
 
for
the
winter
,
I
remain
,
my
dear
Sir
Hugo
,
      
Yours
very
faithfully
,
      
THOMAS
CRANMER
LUSH
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
,
have
receive
this
letter
at
breakfast
,
hand
it
to
Deronda
,
who
,
though
he
have
chamber
in
town
,
be
somehow
hardly
ever
in
them
,
Sir
Hugo
not
be
content
without
him
.
<EOS>
the
chatty
baronet
would
have
like
a
young
companion
even
if
there
have
be
no
peculiar
reason
for
attachment
between
them
:
one
with
a
fine
harmonious
unspoiled
face
fit
to
keep
up
a
cheerful
view
of
posterity
and
inheritance
generally
,
notwithstanding
particular
disappointment
;
and
his
affection
for
Deronda
be
not
diminish
by
the
deep
-
lying
though
not
obtrusive
difference
in
their
notion
and
taste
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
all
the
strong
;
act
as
the
same
sort
of
difference
do
between
a
man
and
a
woman
in
give
a
piquancy
to
the
attachment
which
subsist
in
spite
of
it
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
do
not
think
unapprovingly
of
himself
;
but
he
look
at
man
and
society
from
a
liberal
-
menagerie
point
of
view
,
and
he
have
a
certain
pride
in
Deronda
's
differ
from
him
,
which
,
if
it
have
find
voice
,
may
have
say
 
"
You
see
this
fine
young
fellow
 
not
such
as
you
see
every
day
,
be
he
?
 
<EOS>
he
belong
to
me
in
a
sort
of
way
.
<EOS>
I
bring
him
up
from
a
child
;
but
you
would
not
ticket
him
off
easily
,
he
have
notion
of
his
own
,
and
he
be
as
far
as
the
pole
asunder
from
what
I
be
at
his
age
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
state
of
feeling
be
keep
up
by
the
mental
balance
in
Deronda
,
who
be
move
by
an
affectionateness
such
as
we
be
apt
to
call
feminine
,
dispose
him
to
yield
in
ordinary
detail
,
while
he
have
a
certain
inflexibility
of
judgment
,
and
independence
of
opinion
,
hold
to
be
rightfully
masculine
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
have
read
the
letter
,
he
return
it
without
speak
,
inwardly
wince
under
Lush
's
mode
of
attribute
a
neutral
usefulness
to
him
in
the
family
affair
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
say
,
Dan
?
<EOS>
It
would
be
pleasant
enough
for
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
see
the
place
for
a
good
many
year
now
,
and
you
may
have
a
famous
run
with
the
harrier
if
you
go
down
next
week
,
"
say
Sir
Hugo
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
go
on
that
account
,
"
say
Deronda
,
butter
his
bread
attentively
.
<EOS>
He
have
an
objection
to
this
transparent
kind
of
persuasiveness
,
which
all
intelligent
animal
be
see
to
treat
with
indifference
.
<EOS>
if
he
go
to
Diplow
he
should
be
do
something
disagreeable
to
oblige
Sir
Hugo
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
Lush
's
notion
be
a
good
one
.
<EOS>
and
it
would
be
a
pity
to
lose
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
different
matter
 
if
you
think
my
going
of
importance
to
your
object
,
"
say
Deronda
,
still
with
that
aloofness
of
manner
which
imply
some
suppression
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
the
baronet
have
set
his
heart
on
the
affair
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
will
see
the
fair
gambler
,
the
Leubronn
Diana
,
I
should
not
wonder
,
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
gaily
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
to
invite
her
to
the
Abbey
,
when
they
be
married
,
"
he
add
,
turn
to
Lady
Mallinger
,
as
if
she
too
have
read
the
letter
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
conceive
whom
you
mean
,
"
say
Lady
Mallinger
,
who
in
fact
have
not
be
listen
,
her
mind
have
be
take
up
with
her
first
sip
of
coffee
,
the
objectionable
cuff
of
her
sleeve
,
and
the
necessity
of
carry
Theresa
to
the
dentist
 
innocent
and
partly
laudable
preoccupation
,
as
the
gentle
lady
's
usually
be
.
<EOS>
Should
her
appearance
be
inquire
after
,
let
it
be
say
that
she
have
reddish
blonde
hair
(
the
hair
of
the
period
)
,
a
small
roman
nose
,
rather
prominent
blue
eye
and
delicate
eyelid
,
with
a
figure
which
her
thin
friend
call
fat
,
her
hand
show
curve
and
dimple
like
a
magnify
baby
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
Grandcourt
be
go
to
marry
the
girl
you
see
at
Leubronn
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
remember
her
 
the
Miss
Harleth
who
use
to
play
at
roulette
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
dear
me
!
<EOS>
be
that
a
good
match
for
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
depend
on
the
sort
of
goodness
he
want
,
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
smile
.
"
<EOS>
however
,
she
and
her
friend
have
nothing
,
and
she
will
bring
him
expense
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
good
match
for
my
purpose
,
because
if
I
be
willing
to
fork
out
a
sum
of
money
,
he
may
be
willing
to
give
up
his
chance
of
Diplow
,
so
that
we
shall
have
it
out
and
out
,
and
when
I
die
you
will
have
the
consolation
of
go
to
the
place
you
would
like
to
go
to
 
wherever
I
may
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
not
talk
of
die
in
that
light
way
,
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
rather
a
heavy
way
,
Lou
,
for
I
shall
have
to
pay
a
heavy
sum
 
<EOS>
forty
thousand
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
why
be
we
to
invite
them
to
the
Abbey
?
"
say
Lady
Mallinger
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
_
not
_
like
woman
who
gamble
,
like
Lady
Cragstone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
you
will
not
mind
her
for
a
week
.
<EOS>
besides
,
she
be
not
like
Lady
Cragstone
because
she
gamble
a
little
,
any
more
than
I
be
like
a
broker
because
I
be
a
Whig
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
keep
Grandcourt
in
good
humor
,
and
to
let
him
see
plenty
of
this
place
,
that
he
may
think
the
less
of
Diplow
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
yet
whether
I
shall
get
him
to
meet
me
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
and
if
Dan
be
to
go
over
on
a
visit
there
,
he
may
hold
out
the
bait
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
do
me
a
great
service
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
mean
for
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
Daniel
be
not
fond
of
Mr.
Grandcourt
,
I
think
,
be
he
?
"
say
Lady
Mallinger
,
look
at
Deronda
inquiringly
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
avoid
everybody
one
do
not
happen
to
be
fond
of
,
"
say
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
to
diplow

I
do

anything
well
to
do

it

that
be
a
trump
!
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
well
pleased
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
if
you
do
not
find
it
very
pleasant
,
it
be
so
much
experience
.
<EOS>
nothing
use
to
come
amiss
to
me
when
I
be
young
.
<EOS>
You
must
see
man
and
manner
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
but
I
have
see
that
man
,
and
something
of
his
manner
too
,
"
say
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
nice
manner
,
I
think
,
"
say
Lady
Mallinger
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
you
see
they
succeed
with
your
sex
,
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
provokingly
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
be
an
uncommonly
good
-
look
fellow
when
he
be
two
or
three
and
twenty
 
like
his
father
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
take
after
his
father
in
marry
the
heiress
,
though
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
get
Miss
Arrowpoint
and
my
land
too
,
confound
him
,
he
would
have
have
a
fine
principality
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
,
in
anticipate
the
project
visit
,
feel
less
disinclination
than
when
consent
to
it
.
<EOS>
the
story
of
that
girl
's
marriage
do
interest
him
:
what
he
have
hear
through
Lush
of
her
have
run
away
from
the
suit
of
the
man
she
be
now
go
to
take
as
a
husband
,
have
throw
a
new
sort
of
light
on
her
gambling
;
and
it
be
probably
the
transition
from
that
fevere
worldliness
into
poverty
which
have
urge
her
acceptance
where
she
must
in
some
way
have
feel
repulsion
.
<EOS>
all
this
imply
a
nature
liable
to
difficulty
and
struggle
 
element
of
life
which
have
a
predominant
attraction
for
his
sympathy
,
due
perhaps
to
his
early
pain
in
dwell
on
the
conjecture
story
of
his
own
existence
.
<EOS>
person
attract
him
,
as
Hans
Meyrick
have
do
,
in
proportion
to
the
possibility
of
his
defend
them
,
rescue
them
,
tell
upon
their
life
with
some
sort
of
redeem
influence
;
and
he
have
to
resist
an
inclination
,
easily
account
for
,
to
withdraw
coldly
from
the
fortunate
.
<EOS>
but
in
the
movement
which
have
lead
him
to
repurchase
Gwendolen
's
necklace
for
her
,
and
which
be
at
work
in
him
still
,
there
be
something
beyond
his
habitual
compassionate
fervor
 
something
due
to
the
fascination
of
her
womanhood
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
open
to
that
sort
of
charm
,
and
mingle
it
with
the
consciously
utopian
picture
of
his
own
future
;
yet
any
one
able
to
trace
the
fold
of
his
character
may
have
conceive
that
he
would
be
more
likely
than
many
less
passionate
man
to
love
a
woman
without
tell
her
of
it
.
<EOS>
sprinkle
food
before
a
delicate
-
eared
bird
:
there
be
nothing
he
would
more
willingly
take
,
yet
he
keep
aloof
,
because
of
his
sensibility
to
check
which
to
you
be
imperceptible
.
<EOS>
and
one
man
differ
from
another
,
as
we
all
differ
from
the
Bosjesman
,
in
a
sensibility
to
check
,
that
come
from
variety
of
need
,
spiritual
or
other
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
foreshadow
that
capability
of
reticence
in
Deronda
that
his
imagination
be
much
occupy
with
two
woman
,
to
neither
of
whom
would
he
have
hold
it
possible
that
he
should
ever
make
love
.
<EOS>
Hans
Meyrick
have
laugh
at
him
for
have
something
of
the
knight
-
errant
in
his
disposition
;
and
he
would
have
find
his
proof
if
he
have
know
what
be
just
now
go
on
in
Deronda
's
mind
about
Mirah
and
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
write
without
delay
to
announce
his
visit
to
Diplow
,
and
receive
in
reply
a
polite
assurance
that
his
come
would
give
great
pleasure
.
<EOS>
that
be
not
altogether
untrue
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
think
it
probable
that
the
visit
be
prompt
by
Sir
Hugo
's
desire
to
court
him
for
a
purpose
which
he
do
not
make
up
his
mind
to
resist
;
and
it
be
not
a
disagreeable
idea
to
him
that
this
fine
fellow
,
whom
he
believe
to
be
his
cousin
under
the
rose
,
would
witness
,
perhaps
with
some
jealousy
,
Henleigh
Mallinger
Grandcourt
play
the
command
part
of
betrothed
lover
to
a
splendid
girl
whom
the
cousin
have
already
look
at
with
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
himself
be
not
jealous
of
anything
unless
it
threaten
his
mastery
 
which
he
do
not
think
himself
likely
to
lose
.
      
<EOS>
"
surely
whoever
speak
to
me
in

him

You

<EOS>
He
be
sit
sideways
on
a
sofa
in
the
drawing
-
room
at
Offendene
,
one
hand
and
elbow
resting
on
the
back
,
and
the
other
hand
thrust
between
his
crossed
knee
 
in
the
attitude
of
a
man
who
be
much
interested
in
watch
the
person
next
to
him
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
who
have
always
dislike
needlework
,
have
take
to
it
with
apparent
zeal
since
her
engagement
,
and
now
hold
a
piece
of
white
embroidery
which
,
on
examination
,
would
have
show
many
false
stitch
.
<EOS>
during
the
last
eight
or
nine
day
their
hour
have
be
chiefly
spend
on
horseback
,
but
some
margin
have
always
be
leave
for
this
more
difficult
sort
of
companionship
,
which
,
however
,
Gwendolen
have
not
find
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
well
satisfied
with
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
His
answer
to
her
lively
question
about
what
he
have
see
and
do
in
his
life
,
bore
drawl
very
well
.
<EOS>
from
the
first
she
have
notice
that
he
know
what
to
say
;
and
she
be
constantly
feel
not
only
that
he
have
nothing
of
the
fool
in
his
composition
,
but
that
by
some
subtle
mean
he
communicate
to
her
the
impression
that
all
the
folly
lie
with
other
people
,
who
do
what
he
do
not
care
to
do
.
<EOS>
a
man
who
seem
to
have
be
able
to
command
the
good
,
have
a
sovereign
power
of
depreciation
.
<EOS>
then
Grandcourt
's
behavior
as
a
lover
have
hardly
at
all
pass
the
limit
of
an
amorous
homage
which
be
inobtrusive
as
a
waft
odor
of
rose
,
and
spend
all
its
effect
in
a
gratified
vanity
.
<EOS>
one
day
,
indeed
,
he
have
kiss
not
her
cheek
but
her
neck
a
little
below
her
ear
;
and
Gwendolen
,
take
by
surprise
,
have
start
up
with
a
marked
agitation
which
make
him
rise
too
and
say
,
"
I
beg
your
pardon
 
<EOS>
do
I
annoy
you
?
"
<EOS>
"
oh
,
it
be
nothing
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
rather
afraid
of
herself
,
"
only
I
can
not
bear
 
to
be
kiss
under
my
ear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
sit
down
again
with
a
little
playful
laugh
,
but
<EOS>
all
the
while
she
feel
her
heart
beat
with
a
vague
fear
:
she
be
no
longer
at
liberty
to
flout
him
as
she
have
flout
poor
Rex
.
<EOS>
Her
agitation
seem
not
uncomplimentary
,
and
he
have
be
content
not
to
transgress
again
.
  
<EOS>
to
-
day
a
slight
rain
hinder
ride
;
but
to
compensate
,
a
package
have
come
from
London
,
and
Mrs.
Davilow
have
just
leave
the
room
after
bring
in
for
admiration
the
beautiful
thing
(
of
Grandcourt
's
ordering
)
which
lie
scatter
about
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
be
just
then
enjoy
the
scenery
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
She
let
her
hand
fall
on
her
lap
,
and
say
with
a
pretty
air
of
perversity
    
"
why
be
to
-
morrow
the
only
day
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
the
next
day
be
the
first
with
the
hound
,
"
say
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
after
that
?
"
  
"
after
that
I
must
go
away
for
a
couple
of
day
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
bore
 
<EOS>
but
I
shall
go
one
day
and
come
back
the
next
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Grandcourt
notice
a
change
in
her
face
,
and
release
his
hand
from
under
his
knee
,
he
lay
it
on
hers
,
and
say
,
"
You
object
to
my
go
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
no
use
objecting
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
She
be
resist
to
the
utmost
her
temptation
to
tell
him
that
she
suspect
to
whom
he
be
go
 
the
temptation
to
make
a
clean
breast
,
speak
without
restraint
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
it
be
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
enfold
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
put
off
go
.
<EOS>
and
I
will
travel
at
night
,
so
as
only
to
be
away
one
day
.
"
<EOS>
He
think
that
he
know
the
reason
of
what
he
inwardly
call
this
bit
of
temper
,
and
she
be
particularly
fascinating
to
him
at
this
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
do
not
put
off
go
,
but
travel
at
night
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
feel
that
she
could
command
him
,
and
find
in
this
peremptoriness
a
small
outlet
for
her
irritation
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
will
go
to
Diplow
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
if
you
wish
it
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
in
a
high
tone
of
careless
assent
.
<EOS>
Her
concentration
in
other
feeling
have
really
hinder
her
from
take
notice
that
her
hand
be
be
hold
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
you
treat
us
poor
devil
of
man
!
"
say
Grandcourt
,
lower
his
tone
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
always
get
the
bad
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
be
_
you
?
"
<EOS>
say
Gwendolen
,
in
a
tone
of
inquiry
,
look
at
him
more
naïvely
than
usual
.
<EOS>
She
long
to
believe
this
commonplace
_
badinage
_
as
the
serious
truth
about
her
lover
:
in
that
case
,
she
too
be
justified
.
<EOS>
if
she
know
everything
,
Mrs.
Glasher
would
appear
more
blamable
than
Grandcourt
.
"
<EOS>
_
be
_
<EOS>
you
always
get
the
bad
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
.
be
you
as
kind
to
me
as
I
be
to
you
?
"
say
Grandcourt
,
look
into
her
eye
with
his
narrow
gaze
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
feel
herself
stricken
.
<EOS>
She
be
conscious
of
have
receive
so
much
,
that
her
sense
of
command
be
check
,
and
sink
away
in
the
perception
<EOS>
that
,
look
around
her
as
she
may
,
she
could
not
turn
back
:
it
be
as
if
she
have
consent
to
mount
a
chariot
where
another
hold
the
rein
;
and
it
be
not
in
her
nature
to
leap
out
in
the
eye
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
consent
in
ignorance
,
and
all
she
could
say
now
would
be
a
confession
that
she
have
not
be
ignorant
.
<EOS>
Her
right
to
explanation
be
go
.
<EOS>
all
she
have
to
do
now
be
to
adjust
herself
,
so
that
the
spike
of
that
unwilling
penance
which
conscience
impose
should
not
gall
her
.
<EOS>
with
a
sort
of
mental
shiver
,
she
resolutely
change
her
mental
attitude
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
little
pause
,
during
which
she
have
not
turn
away
her
eye
;
and
with
a
sudden
break
into
a
smile
,
she
say
    
"
if
I
be
as
kind
to
you
as
you
be
to
me
,
that
would
spoil
your
generosity
:
it
would
no
longer
be
as
great
as
it
could
be
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
that
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
be
not
to
ask
for
one
kiss
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
content
to
pay
a
large
price
for
this
new
kind
of
love
-
making
,
which
introduce
marriage
by
the
fine
contrast
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
one
?
<EOS>
"
say
Gwendolen
,
get
saucy
,
and
nod
at
him
defiantly
.
  
<EOS>
He
lift
her
little
left
hand
to
his
lip
,
and
then
release
it
respectfully
.
<EOS>
clearly
it
be
faint
praise
to
say
of
him
that
he
be
not
disgusting
:
he
be
almost
charming
;
and
she
feel
at
this
moment
that
it
be
not
likely
she
could
ever
have
love
another
man
better
than
this
one
.
<EOS>
His
reticence
give
her
some
inexplicable
,
delightful
consciousness

<EOS>
"
Apropos
<EOS>
,

she
say
,
take
up
her
work
again

there

She
have

with
his
shadow
of
a
smile

two

besides
 
one

"
ah
,
then
,
I
have
a
poor
opinion
of
him

Gwendolen
,
shake
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
him
at
Leubronn
 
young
Deronda
 
a
young
fellow

Gwendolen
feel
as

sudden
gambol

her
finger

which
try
to
keep
a
firm
hold
on

get
cold

<EOS>
"
I
never

she
say

dread
any
discernible
change
in
herself

<EOS>
"
be
he
not
disagreeable

<EOS>
"
no

not
particularly

Grandcourt
,
in
his
most
languid
way

He
think
a
little
too
much

I
think
he
have
be
introduce

no

some
one
tell
me
his

I
come
away

that

all

what
be
he

"
a
sort
of
ward
of

nothing

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh

poor

<EOS>
how
very
unpleasant
for
him
!
"
say
Gwendolen
,
speak
from
the
lip
,
and
not
mean
any
sarcasm

<EOS>
"
I
wonder
if
it
have
leave
off
rain
!
"
<EOS>
she
add
,
rise
and
go
to
look
out
of
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
happily
it
do
not
rain
the
next
day
,
and
Gwendolen
ride
to
Diplow
on
Criterion
as
she
have
do
on
that
former
day
when
she
return
with
her
mother
in
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
She
always
feel
the
more
daring
for
be
in
her
riding
-
dress
;
besides
have
the
agreeable
belief
that
she
look
as
well
as
possible
in
it
 
a
sustain
consciousness
in
any
meeting
which
seem
formidable
.
<EOS>
Her
anger
toward
Deronda
have
change
into
a
superstitious
dread
 
due
,
perhaps
,
to
the
coercion
he
have
exercise
over
her
thought
 
lest
the
first
interference
of
his
in
her
life
may
foreshadow
some
future
influence
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
such
stuff
that
superstition
be
commonly
make
:
an
intense
feeling
about
ourselves
which
make
the
evening
star
shine
at
us
with
a
threat
,
and
the
blessing
of
a
beggar
encourage
us
.
<EOS>
and
superstition
carry
consequence
which
often
verify
their
hope
or
their
foreboding
.
  
<EOS>
the
time
before
luncheon
be
take
up
for
Gwendolen
by
go
over
the
room
with
Mrs.
Torrington
and
Mrs.
Davilow
;
and
she
think
it
likely
that
if
she
see
Deronda
,
there
would
hardly
be
need
for
more
than
a
bow
between
them
.
<EOS>
She
mean
to
notice
him
as
little
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
and
after
all
she
find
herself
under
an
inward
compulsion
too
strong
for
her
pride
.
<EOS>
from
the
first
moment
of
their
being
in
the
room
together
,
she
seem
to
herself
to
be
do
nothing
but
notice
him
;
everything
else
be
automatic
performance
of
an
habitual
part
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
take
his
place
at
lunch
,
Grandcourt
have
say
,
"
Deronda
,
Miss
Harleth
tell
me
you
be
not
introduce
to
her
at
Leubronn
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Harleth
hardly
remember
me
,
I
imagine
,
"
say
Deronda
,
look
at
her
quite
simply
,
as
they
bow
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
intensely
occupy
when
I
see
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
now
,
do
he
suppose
that
she
have
not
suspect
him
of
be
the
person
who
redeem
her
necklace
?
  
<EOS>
"
on
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
I
remember
you
very
well
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
feel
rather
nervous
,
but
govern
herself
and
look
at
him
in
return
with
new
examination
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
approve
of
my
playing
at
roulette
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
come
to
that
conclusion
?
"
say
Deronda
,
gravely
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
you
cast
an
evil
eye
on
my
play
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
with
a
turn
of
her
head
and
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
lose
as
soon
as
you
come
to
look
on
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
be
win
till
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Roulette
in
such
a
kennel
as
Leubronn
be
a
horrid
bore
,
"
say
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
I
_
find
it
a
bore
when
I
begin
to
lose
,
"
say
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
Her
face
be
turn
toward
Grandcourt
as
she
smile
and
speak
,
but
she
give
a
sidelong
glance
at
Deronda
,
and
see
his
eye
fix
on
her
with
a
look
so
gravely
penetrate
that
it
have
a
keen
edge
for
her
than
his
ironical
smile
at
her
loss
 
<EOS>
a
keen
edge
than
Klesmer
's
judgment
.
<EOS>
She
wheel
her
neck
round
as
if
she
want
to
listen
to
what
be
be
say
by
the
rest
,
while
she
be
only
think
of
Deronda
.
<EOS>
His
face
have
that
disturb
kind
of
form
and
expression
which
threaten
to
affect
opinion
 
as
if
one
's
standard
be
somehow
wrong
.
<EOS>
(
who
have
not
see
man
with
face
of
this
corrective
power
till
they
frustrate
it
by
speech
or
action
?
)
<EOS>
His
voice
,
hear
now
for
the
first
time
,
be
to
Grandcourt
's
toneless
drawl
,
which
have
be
in
her
ear
every
day
,
as
the
deep
note
of
a
violoncello
to
the
broken
discourse
of
poultry
and
other
lazy
gentry
in
the
afternoon
sunshine
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
,
she
inwardly
conjecture
,
be
perhaps
right
in
say
that
Deronda
think
too
much
of
himself
:
 
a
favorite
way
of
explain
a
superiority
that
humiliate
.
<EOS>
however
the
talk
turn
on
the
rinderpest
and
Jamaica
,
and
no
more
be
say
about
roulette
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
hold
that
the
Jamaica
negro
be
a
beastly
sort
of
baptist
Caliban
;
Deronda
say
he
have
always
feel
a
little
with
Caliban
,
who
naturally
have
his
own
point
of
view
and
could
sing
a
good
song
;
Mrs.
Davilow
observe
that
her
father
have
an
estate
in
Barbadoes
,
but
that
she
herself
have
never
be
in
the
West
Indies
;
Mrs.
Torrington
be
sure
she
should
never
sleep
in
her
bed
if
she
live
among
black
;
her
husband
correct
her
by
say
that
the
black
would
be
manageable
enough
if
it
be
not
for
the
half
-
breed
;
and
Deronda
remark
that
the
white
have
to
thank
themselves
for
the
half
-
breed
.
  
<EOS>
while
this
polite
pea
-
shooting
be
go
on
,
Gwendolen
trifle
with
her
jelly
,
and
look
at
every
speaker
in
turn
that
she
may
feel
at
ease
in
look
at
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
he
think
of
me
,
really
?
<EOS>
He
must
have
feel
interested
in
me
,
else
he
would
not
have
send
me
my
necklace
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
he
think
of
my
marriage
?
<EOS>
what
notion
have
he
to
make
him
so
grave
about
thing
?
<EOS>
why
be
he
come
to
Diplow
?
"
  
<EOS>
these
question
run
in
her
mind
as
the
voice
of
an
uneasy
longing
to
be
judge
by
Deronda
with
unmixed
admiration
 
a
longing
which
have
have
its
seed
in
her
first
resentment
at
his
critical
glance
.
<EOS>
why
do
she
care
so
much
about
the
opinion
of
this
man
who
be
"
nothing
of
any
consequence
"
?
<EOS>
She
have
no
time
to
find
the
reason
 
she
be
too
much
engage
in
care
.
<EOS>
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
when
something
have
call
Grandcourt
away
,
she
go
quite
unpremeditatedly
up
to
Deronda
,
who
be
stand
at
a
table
apart
,
turn
over
some
print
,
and
say
to
him
    
"
Shall
you
hunt
to
-
morrow
,
Mr.
Deronda
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
believe
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
object
to
hunting
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
find
excuse
for
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
sin
I
be
incline
to
 
when
I
can
not
get
boat
or
cricket
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
object
to
my
hunting
?
"
say
Gwendolen
,
with
a
saucy
movement
of
the
chin
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
right
to
object
to
anything
you
choose
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
you
have
a
right
to
object
to
my
gambling
,
"
persist
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
aware
that
I
tell
you
of
my
objection
,
"
say
Deronda
,
with
his
usual
directness
of
gaze
 
<EOS>
a
large
-
eyed
gravity
,
innocent
of
any
intention
.
<EOS>
His
eye
have
a
peculiarity
which
have
draw
many
man
into
trouble
;
they
be
of
a
dark
yet
mild
intensity
which
seem
to
express
a
special
interest
in
every
one
on
whom
he
fix
them
,
and
may
easily
help
to
bring
on
him
those
claim
which
ardently
sympathetic
people
be
often
create
in
the
mind
of
those
who
need
help
.
<EOS>
in
mendicant
fashion
we
make
the
goodness
of
other
a
reason
for
exorbitant
demand
on
them
.
<EOS>
that
sort
of
effect
be
penetrate
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
hinder
me
from
gamble
again
,
"
she
answer
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
no
sooner
speak
than
she
blush
over
face
and
neck
;
and
Deronda
blush
,
too
,
conscious
that
in
the
little
affair
of
the
necklace
he
have
take
a
questionable
freedom
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
speak
further
;
and
she
turn
away
to
a
window
,
feel
that
she
have
stupidly
say
what
she
have
not
mean
to
say
,
and
yet
be
rather
happy
that
she
have
plunge
into
this
mutual
understanding
.
<EOS>
Deronda
also
do
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
seem
more
decidedly
attractive
than
before
;
and
certainly
there
have
be
change
go
on
within
her
since
that
time
at
Leubronn
:
<EOS>
the
struggle
of
mind
attend
a
conscious
error
have
waken
something
like
a
new
soul
,
which
have
well
,
but
also
bad
,
possibility
than
her
former
poise
of
crude
self
-
confidence
:
among
the
force
she
have
come
to
dread
be
something
within
her
that
troubled
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
that
evening
Mrs.
Davilow
say
,
"
be
it
really
so
,
or
only
a
joke
of
yours
,
about
Mr.
Deronda
's
spoil
your
play
,
Gwen
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
curiosity
have
be
excite
,
and
she
could
venture
to
ask
a
question
that
do
not
concern
Mr.
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
it
merely
happen
that
he
be
look
on
when
I
begin
to
lose
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
carelessly
.
<EOS>
"
I
notice
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
wonder
at
that
:
he
be
a
striking
young
man
.
<EOS>
He
put
me
in
mind
of
italian
painting
.
<EOS>
one
would
guess
,
without
be
tell
,
that
there
be
foreign
blood
in
his
vein
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
there
?
"
say
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Torrington
say
so
.
<EOS>
I
ask
particularly
who
he
be
,
and
she
tell
me
that
his
mother
be
some
foreigner
of
high
rank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
mother
?
"
say
Gwendolen
,
rather
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
then
who
be
his
father
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
 
every
one
say
he
be
the
son
of
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
,
who
bring
him
up
;
though
he
pass
for
a
ward
.
<EOS>
She
say
,
if
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
could
have
do
as
he
like
with
his
estate
,
he
would
have
leave
them
to
this
Mr.
Deronda
,
since
he
have
no
legitimate
son
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
be
silent
;
but
her
mother
observe
so
mark
an
effect
in
her
face
that
she
be
angry
with
herself
for
have
repeat
Mrs.
Torrington
's
gossip
.
<EOS>
It
seem
,
on
reflection
,
unsuite
to
the
ear
of
her
daughter
,
for
whom
Mrs.
Davilow
dislike
what
be
call
knowledge
of
the
world
;
and
indeed
she
wish
that
she
herself
have
not
have
any
of
it
thrust
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
an
image
which
have
immediately
arise
in
Gwendolen
's
mind
be
that
of
the
unknown
mother
 
no
doubt
a
dark
-
eyed
woman
 
probably
sad
.
<EOS>
hardly
any
face
could
be
less
like
Deronda
's
than
that
represent
as
Sir
Hugo
be
in
a
crayon
portrait
at
Diplow
.
<EOS>
a
dark
-
eyed
woman
,
no
longer
young
,
have
become
"
stuff
o
'
the
conscience
"
to
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
that
night
when
she
have
get
into
her
little
bed
,
and
only
a
dim
light
be
burn
,
she
say
    
"
Mamma
,
have
man
generally
child
before
they
be
married
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
dear
,
no
,
"
say
Mrs.
Davilow
.
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
ask
such
a
question
?
"
<EOS>
(
but
she
begin
to
think
that
she
see
the
why
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
so
,
I
ought
to
know
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
with
some
indignation
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
think
of
what
I
say
about
Mr.
Deronda
and
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger

<EOS>
that
be
a
very
unusual
case

dear

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
Lady
Mallinger
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
know
enough
to
satisfy
her
.
<EOS>
that
be
quite
clear
,
because
Mr.
Deronda
have
live
with
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
people
think
no
bad
of
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
of
course
he
be
under
some
disadvantage
:
it
be
not
as
if
he
be
Lady
Mallinger
's
son
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
inherit
the
property
,
and
he
be
not
of
any
consequence
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
but
people
be
not
oblige
to
know
anything
about
his
birth
;
you
see
,
he
be
very
well
receive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
he
know
about
it
;
and
whether
he
be
angry
with
his
father
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
child
,
why
should
you
think
of
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
?
"
say
Gwendolen
,
impetuously
,
sit
up
in
her
bed
.
"
<EOS>
have
not
child
reason
to
be
angry
with
their
parent
?
<EOS>
how
can
they
help
their
parent
marry
or
not
marry
?
"
  
<EOS>
but
a
consciousness
rush
upon
her
,
which
make
her
fall
back
again
on
her
pillow
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
only
what
she
would
have
feel
month
before
 
that
she
may
seem
to
be
reproach
her
mother
for
that
second
marriage
of
her
;
what
she
chiefly
feel
now
be
,
that
she
have
be
lead
on
to
a
condemnation
which
seem
to
make
her
own
marriage
a
forbid
thing
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
further
talk
,
and
till
sleep
come
over
her
Gwendolen
lie
struggle
with
the
reason
against
that
marriage
 
reason
which
press
upon
her
newly
now
that
they
be
unexpectedly
mirror
in
the
story
of
a
man
whose
slight
relation
with
her
have
,
by
some
hide
affinity
,
bitten
themselves
into
the
most
permanent
layer
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
It
be
characteristic
that
,
with
all
her
debating
,
she
be
never
trouble
by
the
question
whether
the
indefensibleness
of
her
marriage
do
not
include
the
fact
that
she
have
accept
Grandcourt
solely
as
a
man
whom
it
be
convenient
for
her
to
marry
,
not
in
the
least
as
one
to
whom
she
would
be
bind
herself
in
duty
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
idea
be
pitiably
crude
;
but
many
grand
difficulty
of
life
be
apt
to
force
themselves
on
us
in
our
crudity
.
<EOS>
and
to
judge
wisely
,
I
suppose
we
must
know
how
thing
appear
to
the
unwise
;
that
kind
of
appearance
make
the
large
part
of
the
world
's
history
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
morning
there
be
a
double
excitement
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
go
to
hunt
,
from
which
scruple
about
propriety
have
threaten
to
hinder
her
,
until
it
be
find
that
Mrs.
Torrington
be
horsewoman
enough
to
accompany
her
 
go
to
hunt
for
the
first
time
since
her
escapade
with
Rex
;
and
she
be
go
again
to
see
Deronda
,
in
whom
,
since
last
night
,
her
interest
have
so
gather
that
she
expect
,
as
people
do
about
reveal
celebrity
,
to
see
something
in
his
appearance
which
she
have
miss
before
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
he
go
to
be
?
<EOS>
what
sort
of
life
have
he
before
him
 
he
be
nothing
of
any
consequence
?
<EOS>
and
with
only
a
little
difference
in
event
he
may
have
be
as
important
as
Grandcourt
,
nay
 
<EOS>
her
imagination
inevitably
go
into
that
direction
 
may
have
hold
the
very
estate
which
Grandcourt
be
to
have
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
Deronda
would
probably
some
day
see
her
mistress
of
the
Abbey
at
Topping
,
see
her
bear
the
title
which
would
have
be
his
own
wife
's
.
<EOS>
these
obvious
,
futile
thought
of
what
may
have
be
,
make
a
new
epoch
for
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
She
,
whose
unquestionable
habit
it
have
be
to
take
the
good
that
come
to
her
for
less
than
her
own
claim
,
have
now
to
see
the
position
which
tempt
her
in
a
new
light
,
as
a
hard
,
unfair
exclusion
of
other
.
<EOS>
what
she
have
now
hear
about
Deronda
seem
to
her
imagination
to
throw
him
into
one
group
with
Mrs.
Glasher
and
her
child
;
before
whom
she
feel
herself
in
an
attitude
of
apology
 
she
who
have
hitherto
be
surround
by
a
group
that
in
her
opinion
have
nee
be
apologetic
to
her
.
<EOS>
perhaps
Deronda
himself
be
think
of
these
thing
.
<EOS>
Could
he
know
of
Mrs.
Glasher
?
<EOS>
if
he
know
that
she
know
,
he
would
despise
her
;
but
he
could
have
no
such
knowledge
.
<EOS>
Would
he
,
without
that
,
despise
her
for
marry
Grandcourt
?
<EOS>
His
possible
judgment
of
her
action
be
tell
on
her
as
importunately
as
Klesmer
's
judgment
of
her
power
;
but
she
find
large
room
for
resistance
to
a
disapproval
of
her
marriage
,
because
it
be
easy
to
make
our
conduct
seem
justifiable
to
ourselves
than
to
make
our
ability
strike
other
.
<EOS>
"
how
can
I
help
it
?
"
be
not
our
favorite
apology
for
incompetency
.
<EOS>
but
Gwendolen
feel
some
strength
in
say
    
"
how
can
I
help
what
other
people
have
do
?
<EOS>
thing
would
not
come
right
if
I
be
to
turn
round
now
and
declare
that
I
would
not
marry
Mr.
Grandcourt
.
"
<EOS>
and
such
turning
round
be
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
the
horse
in
the
chariot
she
have
mount
be
go
at
full
speed
.
  
<EOS>
this
mood
of
youthful
,
elated
desperation
have
a
tidal
recurrence
.
<EOS>
She
could
dare
anything
that
lie
before
her
sooner
than
she
could
choose
to
go
backward
,
into
humiliation
;
and
it
be
even
soothe
to
think
that
there
would
now
be
as
much
ill
-
do
in
the
one
as
in
the
other
.
<EOS>
but
the
immediate
delightful
fact
be
the
hunt
,
where
she
would
see
Deronda
,
and
where
he
would
see
her
;
for
always
lurk
ready
to
obtrude
before
other
thought
about
him
be
the
impression
that
he
be
very
much
interested
in
her
.
<EOS>
but
to
-
day
she
be
resolve
not
to
repeat
her
folly
of
yesterday
,
as
if
she
be
anxious
to
say
anything
to
him
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
hunt
would
be
too
absorb
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
it
be
for
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
Deronda
be
there
,
and
within
her
sight
very
often
;
but
this
only
add
to
the
stimulus
of
a
pleasure
which
Gwendolen
have
only
once
before
taste
,
and
which
seem
likely
always
to
give
a
delight
independent
of
any
crosse
,
except
such
as
take
away
the
chance
of
ride
.
<EOS>
no
accident
happen
to
throw
them
together
;
the
run
take
them
within
convenient
reach
of
home
,
and
the
agreeable
sombreness
of
the
gray
November
afternoon
,
with
a
long
stratum
of
yellow
light
in
the
west
,
Gwendolen
be
return
with
the
company
from
Diplow
,
who
be
attend
her
on
the
way
to
Offendene
.
<EOS>
now
the
sense
of
glorious
excitement
be
over
and
go
,
she
be
get
irritably
disappointed
that
she
have
have
no
opportunity
of
speak
to
Deronda
,
whom
she
would
not
see
again
,
since
he
be
to
go
away
in
a
couple
of
day
.
<EOS>
what
be
she
go
to
say
?
<EOS>
that
be
not
quite
certain
.
<EOS>
She
want
to
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
be
by
her
side
;
Mrs.
Torrington
,
her
husband
,
and
another
gentleman
in
advance
;
and
Deronda
's
horse
she
could
hear
behind
.
<EOS>
the
wish
to
speak
to
him
and
have
him
speak
to
her
be
become
imperious
;
and
there
be
no
chance
of
it
unless
she
simply
assert
her
will
and
defy
everything
.
<EOS>
where
the
order
of
thing
could
give
way
to
Miss
Gwendolen
,
it
must
be
make
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
They
have
lately
emerge
from
a
wood
of
pine
and
beech
,
where
the
twilight
stillness
have
a
repress
effect
,
which
increase
her
impatience
.
<EOS>
the
horse
-
hoofs
again
hear
behind
at
some
little
distance
be
a
grow
irritation
.
<EOS>
She
rein
in
her
horse
and
look
behind
her
;
Grandcourt
after
a
few
pace
,
also
pause
;
but
she
,
wave
her
whip
and
nodding
sideway
with
playful
imperiousness
,
say
,
"
go
on
!
<EOS>
I
want
to
speak
to
Mr.
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
hesitate
;
but
that
he
would
have
do
after
any
proposition
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
awkward
situation
for
him
.
<EOS>
no
gentleman
,
before
marriage
;
could
give
the
emphasis
of
refusal
to
a
command
deliver
in
this
playful
way
.
<EOS>
He
ride
on
slowly
,
and
she
wait
till
Deronda
come
up
.
<EOS>
He
look
at
her
with
tacit
inquiry
,
and
she
say
at
once
,
let
her
horse
go
alongside
of
his
    
"
Mr.
Deronda
,
you
must
enlighten
my
ignorance
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
why
you
think
it
wrong
for
me
to
gamble
.
<EOS>
be
it
because
I
be
a
woman
?
"
  
"
not
altogether
;
but
I
regret
it
the
more
because
you
be
a
woman
,
"
say
Deronda
,
with
an
irrepressible
smile
.
<EOS>
apparently
it
must
be
understand
between
them
now
that
it
be
he
who
send
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
would
be
well
for
man
not
to
gamble
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
besotting
kind
of
taste
,
likely
to
turn
into
a
disease
.
<EOS>
and
,
besides
,
there
be
something
revolt
to
me
in
rake
a
heap
of
money
together
,
and
internally
chuckle
over
it
,
when
other
be
feel
the
loss
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
should
even
call
it
base
,
if
it
be
more
than
an
exceptional
lapse
.
<EOS>
there
be
enough
inevitable
turn
of
fortune
which
force
us
to
see
that
our
gain
be
another
's
loss
:
 
that
be
one
of
the
ugly
aspect
of
life
.
<EOS>
one
would
like
to
reduce
it
as
much
as
one
<EOS>
could
,
not
get
amusement
out
of
exaggerate
it
.
<EOS>
"
Deronda
's
voice
have
gather
some
indignation
while
he
be
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
do
admit
that
we
can
not
help
thing
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
with
a
drop
in
her
tone
.
<EOS>
the
answer
have
not
be
anything
like
what
she
have
expect
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
thing
be
so
in
spite
of
us
;
we
can
not
always
help
it
that
our
gain
be
another
's
loss
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
clearly
.
<EOS>
because
of
that
,
we
should
help
it
where
we
can
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
bite
her
lip
inside
,
pause
a
moment
,
and
then
force
herself
to
speak
with
an
air
of
playfulness
again
,
say
    
"
<EOS>
but
why
should
you
regret
it
more
because
I
be
a
woman
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
perhaps
because
we
need
that
you
should
be
well
than
we
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
suppose
_
we
_
need
that
man
should
be
well
than
we
be
,
"
say
Gwendolen
with
a
little
air
of
"
check
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
rather
a
difficulty
,
"
say
Deronda
,
smile
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
should
have
say
,
we
each
of
us
think
it
would
be
well
for
the
other
to
be
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
I
need
you
to
be
well
than
I
be
 
<EOS>
and
you
think
so
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
nodding
and
laughing
,
while
she
put
her
horse
forward
and
join
Grandcourt
,
who
make
no
observation
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
want
to
know
what
I
have
to
say
to
Mr.
Deronda
?
"
say
Gwendolen
,
whose
own
pride
require
her
to
account
for
her
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
 
no
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
coldly
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
that
be
the
first
impolite
word
you
have
speak
 
that
you
do
not

I
have
to

Gwendolen

play
at
a
pout

<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
hear
what
you
say
to
me
 
not
to
other
man

Grandcourt

<EOS>
"
then
you
wish
to
hear
this

<EOS>
I
want
to
make
him
tell
me
why
he
object
to
my
gambling
,
and
he
give
me
a
little
sermon
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
 
but
excuse
me
the
sermon
.
<EOS>
"
if
Gwendolen
imagine
that
Grandcourt
care
about
her
speak
to
Deronda
,
he
wish
her
to
understand
that
she
be
mistaken

<EOS>
but
he
be
not
fond
of
be
tell
to
ride
on

She
see
he

but
do
not

<EOS>
She
have
accomplish
her
object
of
speak
again
to
Deronda
before
he
raise
his
hat

with
the
rest

Diplow

Offendene

farewell

truth
in

the
journey
a
bore

he

go
by
train
to
Gadsmere

yet
they

amid
deep

which

peculiarly
open

suspicion

Gadsmere
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glasher
's
four
beautiful
child

who

there
for
about
three
year

<EOS>
now
,
in
November
,
when
the
flower

bed
be
empty
,
the
tree
leafless
,
and
the

blackly
shiver

one
may
have
say
that
the
place
be
sombrely
in
keep
with
the
black
road
and
black
mound
which
seem
to
put
the
district
in
mourning
;
 
except
when
the
child
be
play
on
the
gravel
with
the
dog
for
their
companion

<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Glasher
,
under
her
present
circumstance
,
like
Gadsmere
as
well
as
she
would
have
like
any
other
abode

<EOS>
the
complete
seclusion
of
the
place
,
which
the
unattractiveness
of
the
country
secure
,
be
exactly
to
her
taste
.
<EOS>
when
she
drive
her
two
pony
with
a
waggonet
full
of
child
,
there
be
no
gentry
in
carriage
to
be
meet
,
only
man
of
business
in
gig
;
at
church
there
be
no
eye
she
care
to
avoid
,
for
the
curate
's
wife
and
the
curate
himself
be
either
ignorant
of
anything
to
her
disadvantage
,
or
ignore
it
:
to
them
she
be
simply
a
widow
lady
,
the
tenant
of
Gadsmere
;
and
<EOS>
the
name
of
Grandcourt
be
of
little
interest
in
that
district
compare
with
the
name
of
Fletcher
and
Gawcome
,
the
lessee
of
the
colliery

<EOS>
It
be
full
ten
year
since
the
elopement
of
an
irish
officer
's
beautiful
wife
with
young
Grandcourt
,
and
a
consequent
duel
where
the
bullet
wound
the
air
only
,
have
make
some
little
noise
.
<EOS>
Most
of
those
who
remember
the
affair
now
wonder
what
have
become
of
that
Mrs.
Glasher
,
whose
beauty
and
brilliancy
have
make
her
rather
conspicuous
to
them
in
foreign
place
,
where
she
be
know
to
be
live
with
young
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
that
he
should
have
disentangle
himself
from
that
connection
seem
only
natural
and
desirable
.
<EOS>
as
to
her
,
it
be
think
that
a
woman
who
be
understand
to
have
forsake
her
child
along
with
her
husband
have
probably
sink
lower
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
have
of
course
get
weary
of
her
.
<EOS>
He
be
much
give
to
the
pursuit
of
woman
:
but
a
man
in
his
position
would
by
this
time
desire
to
make
a
suitable
marriage
with
the
fair
young
daughter
of
a
noble
house
.
<EOS>
no
one
talk
of
Mrs.
Glasher
now
,
any
more
than
they
talk
of
the
victim
in
a
trial
for
manslaughter
ten
year
before
:
she
be
a
lost
vessel
after
whom
nobody
would
send
out
an
expedition
of
search
;
but
Grandcourt
be
see
in
harbor
with
his
color
fly
,
register
as
seaworthy
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
yet
,
in
fact
,
Grandcourt
have
never
disentangle
himself
from
Mrs.
Glasher
.
<EOS>
His
passion
for
her
have
be
the
strong
and
most
lasting
he
have
ever
know
;
and
though
it
be
now
as
dead
as
the
music
of
a
crack
flute
,
it
have
leave
a
certain
dull
disposedness
,
which
,
on
the
death
of
her
husband
three
year
before
,
have
prompt
in
him
a
vacillate
notion
of
marry
her
,
in
accordance
with
the
understanding
often
express
between
them
during
the
day
of
his
first
ardor
.
<EOS>
at
that
early
time
Grandcourt
would
willingly
have
pay
for
the
freedom
to
be
win
by
a
divorce
;
but
the
husband
would
not
oblige
him
,
not
want
to
be
marry
again
himself
,
and
not
wish
to
have
his
domestic
habit
print
in
evidence
.
  
<EOS>
the
altered
poise
which
the
year
have
bring
in
Mrs.
Glasher
be
just
the
reverse
.
<EOS>
at
first
she
be
comparatively
careless
about
the
possibility
of
marriage
.
<EOS>
It
be
enough
that
she
have
escape
from
a
disagreeable
husband
and
find
a
sort
of
bliss
with
a
lover
who
have
completely
fascinate
her
 
young
,
handsome
,
amorous
,
and
live
in
the
good
style
,
with
equipage
and
conversation
of
the
kind
to
be
expect
in
young
man
of
fortune
who
have
see
everything
.
<EOS>
She
be
an
impassioned
,
vivacious
woman
,
fond
of
adoration
,
exasperate
by
five
year
of
marital
rudeness
;
and
the
sense
of
release
be
so
strong
upon
her
that
it
still
anxiety
for
more
than
she
actually
enjoy
.
<EOS>
an
equivocal
position
be
of
no
importance
to
her
then
;
she
have
no
envy
for
the
honor
of
a
dull
,
disregarded
wife
:
the
one
spot
which
spoil
her
vision
of
her
new
pleasant
world
,
be
the
sense
that
she
leave
her
three
-
year
-
old
boy
,
who
die
two
year
afterward
,
and
whose
first
tone
say
"
mamma
"
retain
a
difference
from
those
of
the
child
that
come
after
.
<EOS>
but
now
the
year
have
bring
many
change
besides
those
in
the
contour
of
her
cheek
and
throat
;
and
that
Grandcourt
should
marry
her
have
become
her
dominant
desire
.
<EOS>
the
equivocal
position
which
she
have
not
mind
about
for
herself
be
now
tell
upon
her
through
her
child
,
whom
she
love
with
a
devotion
charge
with
the
add
passion
of
atonement
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
repentance
except
in
this
direction
.
<EOS>
if
Grandcourt
marry
her
,
the
child
would
be
none
the
bad
off
for
what
have
pass
:
they
would
see
their
mother
in
a
dignified
position
,
and
they
would
be
at
no
disadvantage
with
the
world
:
her
son
could
be
make
his
father
's
heir
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
yearning
for
this
result
which
give
the
supreme
importance
to
Grandcourt
's
feeling
for
her
;
her
love
for
him
have
long
resolve
itself
into
anxiety
that
he
should
give
her
the
unique
,
permanent
claim
of
a
wife
,
and
she
expect
no
other
happiness
in
marriage
than
the
satisfaction
of
her
maternal
love
and
pride
 
include
her
pride
for
herself
in
the
presence
of
her
child
.
<EOS>
for
the
sake
of
that
result
she
be
prepare
even
with
a
tragic
firmness
to
endure
anything
quietly
in
marriage
;
and
she
have
acuteness
enough
to
cherish
Grandcourt
's
flickering
purpose
negatively
,
by
not
molest
him
with
passionate
appeal
and
with
scene
-
making
.
<EOS>
in
her
,
as
in
every
one
else
who
want
anything
of
him
,
his
incalculable
turn
,
and
his
tendency
to
harden
under
beseeching
,
have
create
a
reasonable
dread
:
 
a
slow
discovery
,
of
which
no
presentiment
have
be
give
in
the
bearing
of
a
youthful
lover
with
a
fine
line
of
face
and
the
soft
manner
.
<EOS>
but
reticence
have
necessarily
cost
something
to
this
impassioned
woman
,
and
she
be
the
bitterer
for
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
quailing
 
even
that
force
on
the
helpless
and
injure
 
which
have
not
an
ugly
obverse
:
the
withhold
sting
be
gather
venom
.
<EOS>
She
be
absolutely
dependent
on
Grandcourt
;
for
though
he
have
be
always
liberal
in
expense
for
her
,
he
have
keep
everything
voluntary
on
his
part
;
and
with
the
goal
of
marriage
before
her
,
she
would
ask
for
nothing
less
.
<EOS>
He
have
say
that
he
would
never
settle
anything
except
by
will
;
and
when
she
be
think
of
alternative
for
the
future
it
often
occur
to
her
that
,
even
if
she
do
not
become
Grandcourt
's
wife
,
he
may
never
have
a
son
who
would
have
a
legitimate
claim
on
him
,
and
the
end
may
be
that
her
son
would
be
make
heir
to
the
good
part
of
his
estate
.
<EOS>
no
son
at
that
early
age
could
promise
to
have
more
of
his
father
's
physique
.
<EOS>
but
her
become
Grandcourt
's
wife
be
so
far
from
be
an
extravagant
notion
of
possibility
,
that
even
Lush
have
entertain
it
,
and
have
say
that
he
would
as
soon
bet
on
it
as
on
any
other
likelihood
with
regard
to
his
familiar
companion
.
<EOS>
lush
,
indeed
,
on
infer
that
Grandcourt
have
a
preconception
of
use
his
residence
at
Diplow
in
order
to
win
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
have
think
it
well
to
fan
that
project
,
take
it
as
a
tacit
renunciation
of
the
marriage
with
Mrs.
Glasher
,
which
have
long
be
a
mark
for
the
hovering
and
wheeling
of
Grandcourt
's
caprice
.
<EOS>
but
both
prospect
have
be
negative
by
Gwendolen
's
appearance
on
the
scene
;
and
it
be
natural
enough
for
Mrs.
Glasher
to
enter
with
eagerness
into
Lush
's
plan
of
hinder
that
new
danger
by
set
up
a
barrier
in
the
mind
of
the
girl
who
be
be
seek
as
a
bride
.
<EOS>
She
enter
into
it
with
an
eagerness
which
have
passion
in
it
as
well
as
purpose
,
some
of
the
store
-
up
venom
deliver
itself
in
that
way
.
  
<EOS>
after
that
,
she
have
hear
from
Lush
of
Gwendolen
's
departure
,
and
the
probability
that
all
danger
from
her
be
get
rid
of
;
but
there
have
be
no
letter
to
tell
her
that
the
danger
have
return
and
have
become
a
certainty
.
<EOS>
She
have
since
then
write
to
Grandcourt
,
as
she
do
habitually
,
and
he
have
be
long
than
usual
in
answering
.
<EOS>
She
be
infer
that
he
may
intend
come
to
Gadsmere
at
the
time
when
he
be
actually
on
the
way
;
and
she
be
not
without
hope
 
<EOS>
what
construction
of
another
's
mind
be
not
strong
wishing
equal
to
?
 
<EOS>
that
a
certain
sickening
from
that
frustrated
courtship
may
dispose
him
to
slip
the
more
easily
into
the
old
track
of
intention
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
have
two
grave
purpose
in
come
to
Gadsmere
:
to
convey
the
news
of
his
approach
marriage
in
person
,
in
order
to
make
this
first
difficulty
final
;
and
to
get
from
Lydia
his
mother
's
diamond
,
which
long
ago
he
have
confide
to
her
and
wish
her
to
wear
.
<EOS>
Her
person
suited
diamond
,
and
make
them
look
as
if
they
be
worth
some
of
the
money
give
for
them
.
<EOS>
these
particular
diamond
be
not
mountain
of
light
 
<EOS>
they
be
mere
pea
and
haricot
for
the
ear
,
neck
and
hair
;
but
they
be
worth
some
thousand
,
and
Grandcourt
necessarily
wish
to
have
them
for
his
wife
.
<EOS>
formerly
when
he
have
ask
Lydia
to
put
them
into
his
keeping
again
,
simply
on
the
ground
that
they
would
be
safe
and
ought
to
be
deposit
at
the
bank
,
she
have
quietly
but
absolutely
refuse
,
declare
that
they
be
quite
safe
;
and
at
last
have
say
,
"
if
you
ever
marry
another
woman
I
will
give
them
up
to
her
:
be
you
go
to
marry
another
woman
?
<EOS>
"
at
that
time
Grandcourt
have
no
motive
which
urge
him
to
persist
,
and
he
have
this
grace
in
him
,
that
the
disposition
to
exercise
power
either
by
cow
or
disappointing
other
or
exciting
in
them
a
rage
which
they
dare
not
express
 
a
disposition
which
be
active
in
him
as
other
propensity
become
languid
 
have
always
be
in
abeyance
before
Lydia
.
<EOS>
a
severe
interpreter
may
say
that
the
mere
fact
of
their
relation
to
each
other
,
the
melancholy
position
of
this
woman
who
depend
on
his
will
,
make
a
standing
banquet
for
his
delight
in
dominating
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
something
else
than
this
in
his
forbearance
toward
her
:
there
be
the
surviving
though
metamorphose
effect
of
the
power
she
have
have
over
him
;
and
it
be
this
effect
,
the
fitful
dull
lapse
toward
solicitation
that
once
have
the
z
now
miss
from
life
,
which
have
again
and
again
incline
him
to
espouse
a
familiar
past
rather
than
rouse
himself
to
the
expectation
of
novelty
.
<EOS>
but
now
novelty
have
take
hold
of
him
and
urge
him
to
make
the
most
of
it
.

She

a
pause
before
he
say
,
without
change
of
manner
,
"
that
I
be
think
of
marrying
.
<EOS>
You
see
Miss
Harleth
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
She
_
tell
you
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
pale
cheek
look
even
paler
,
perhaps
from
the
fierce
brightness
in
the
eye
above
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
Lush
tell
me
,
"
be
the
slow
answer
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
the
thumb
-
screw
and
the
iron
boot
be
be
place
by
creep
hand
within
sight
of
the
expectant
victim
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
God
!
<EOS>
say
at
once
that
you
be
go
to
marry
her
,
"
she
burst
out
,
passionately
,
her
knee
shake
and
her
hand
tightly
clasp
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
this
kind
of
thing
must
happen
some
time
or
other
,
Lydia
,
"
say
he
;
really
,
now
the
thumb
-
screw
be
on
,
not
wish
to
make
the
pain
bad
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
always
see
the
necessity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
not
.
<EOS>
I
see
it
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
those
few
under
-
tone
word
of
Grandcourt
's
she
feel
as
absolute
a
resistance
as
if
her
thin
finger
have
be
push
at
a
fast
shut
iron
door
.
<EOS>
She
know
her
helplessness
,
and
shrink
from
test
it
by
any
appeal
 
shrink
from
cry
in
a
dead
ear
and
cling
to
dead
knee
,
only
to
see
the
immovable
face
and
feel
the
rigid
limb
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
weep
nor
speak
;
she
be
too
hard
press
by
the
sudden
certainty
which
have
as
much
of
chill
sickness
in
it
as
of
thought
and
emotion
.
<EOS>
the
defeat
clutch
of
struggle
hope
give
her
in
these
first
moment
a
horrible
sensation
.
<EOS>
at
last
she
rise
,
with
a
spasmodic
effort
,
and
,
unconscious
of
every
thing
but
her
wretchedness
,
press
her
forehead
against
the
hard
,
cold
glass
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
the
child
,
play
on
the
gravel
,
take
this
as
a
sign
that
she
want
them
,
and
,
run
forward
,
stand
in
front
of
her
with
their
sweet
face
upturne
expectantly
.
<EOS>
this
rouse
her
:
she
shake
her
head
at
them
,
wave
them
off
,
and
overcome
with
this
painful
exertion
,
sink
back
in
the
near
chair
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
have
rise
too
.
<EOS>
He
be
doubly
annoy
 
at
the
scene
itself
,
and
at
the
sense
that
no
imperiousness
of
his
could
save
him
from
it
;
but
the
task
have
to
be
go
through
,
and
there
be
the
administrative
necessity
of
arrange
thing
so
that
there
should
be
as
little
annoyance
as
possible
in
the
future
.
<EOS>
He
be
lean
against
the
corner
of
the
fire
-
place
.
<EOS>
She
look
up
at
him
and
say
,
bitterly
    
"
<EOS>
all
this
be
of
no
consequence
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
and
the
child
be
importunate
creature
.
<EOS>
You
wish
to
get
away
again
and
be
with
Miss
Harleth
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
make
the
affair
more
disagreeable
than
it
nee
be
.
<EOS>
Lydia
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
no
use
to
harp
on
thing
that
can
not
be
alter
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
its
deucedly
disagreeable
to
me
to
see
you
make
yourself
miserable
.
<EOS>
I
have
take
this
journey
to
tell
you
what
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
 
you
and
the
child
will
be
provide
for
as
usual
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Silence
.
<EOS>
She
dare
not
answer
.
<EOS>
this
woman
with
the
intense
,
eager
look
have
have
the
iron
of
the
mother
's
anguish
in
her
soul
,
and
it
have
make
her
sometimes
capable
of
a
repression
harder
than
shriek
and
struggle
.
<EOS>
but
underneath
the
silence
there
be
an
outlash
of
hatred
and
vindictiveness
:
she
wish
that
the
marriage
may
make
two
other
wretche
,
besides
herself
.
<EOS>
presently
he
go
on
    
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
well
for
you
.
<EOS>
You
may
go
on
live
here
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
of
by
-
and
-
by
settle
a
good
sum
on
you
and
the
child
,
and
you
can
live
where
you
like
.
<EOS>
there
will
be
nothing
for
you
to
complain
of
then
.
<EOS>
whatever
happen
,
you
will
feel
secure
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
do
beforehand
.
<EOS>
every
thing
have
go
on
in
a
hurry
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
cease
his
slow
delivery
of
sentence
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
expect
her
to
thank
him
,
but
he
consider
that
she
may
reasonably
be
content
;
if
it
be
possible
for
Lydia
to
be
content
.
<EOS>
She
show
no
change
,
and
after
a
minute
he
say
    
"
You
have
never
have
any
reason
to
fear
that
I
should
be
illiberal
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
a
curse
about
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
do
care
about
it
,
I
suppose
you
would
not
give
it
us
,
"
say
Lydia
.
<EOS>
the
sarcasm
be
irrepressible
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
devilishly
unfair
thing
to
say
,
"
Grandcourt
reply
,
in
a
low
tone
;
"
and
I
advise
you
not
to
say
that
sort
of
thing
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Should
you
punish
me
by
leave
the
child
in
beggary
?
"
<EOS>
in
spite
of
herself
,
the
one
outlet
of
venom
have
bring
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
question
about
leave
the
child
in
beggary
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
still
in
his
low
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
advise
you
not
to
say
thing
that
you
will
repent
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
use
to
repent
,
"
say
she
,
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
will
repent
.
<EOS>
You
have
already
repent
of
love
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
all
this
will
only
make
it
uncommonly
difficult
for
us
to
meet
again
.
<EOS>
what
friend
have
you
besides
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
quite
true
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
word
come
like
a
low
moan
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
moment
there
flash
through
her
the
wish
that
after
promise
himself
a
well
happiness
than
that
he
have
have
with
her
,
he
may
feel
a
misery
and
loneliness
which
would
drive
him
back
to
her
to
find
some
memory
of
a
time
when
he
be
young
,
glad
,
and
hopeful
.
<EOS>
but
no
!
<EOS>
he
would
go
scathless
;
it
be
she
that
have
to
suffer
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
the
scorching
word
be
end
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
have
mean
to
stay
till
evening
;
he
wish
to
curtail
his
visit
,
but
there
be
no
suitable
train
earlier
than
the
one
he
have
arrange
to
go
by
,
and
he
have
still
to
speak
to
Lydia
on
the
second
object
of
his
visit
,
which
like
a
second
surgical
operation
seem
to
require
an
interval
.
<EOS>
the
hour
have
to
go
by
;
there
be
eat
to
be
do
;
the
child
come
in
 
<EOS>
all
this
mechanism
of
life
have
to
be
go
through
with
the
dreary
sense
of
constraint
which
be
often
feel
in
domestic
quarrel
of
a
commoner
kind
.
<EOS>
to
Lydia
it
be
some
slight
relief
for
her
stifle
fury
to
have
the
child
present
:
she
feel
a
savage
glory
in
their
loveliness
,
as
if
it
would
taunt
Grandcourt
with
his
indifference
to
her
<EOS>
and
them
 
<EOS>
a
secret
darting
of
venom
which
be
strongly
imaginative
.
<EOS>
He
acquit
himself
with
all
the
advantage
of
a
man
whose
grace
of
bearing
have
long
be
mould
on
an
experience
of
boredom
 
nurse
the
little
Antonia
,
who
sit
with
her
hand
cross
and
eye
upturned
to
his
bald
head
,
which
strike
her
as
worthy
of
observation
 
and
propitiate
Henleigh
by
promise
him
a
beautiful
saddle
and
bridle
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
the
two
eld
girl
who
have
know
him
as
a
continual
presence
;
and
the
intervene
year
have
overlay
their
infantine
memory
with
a
bashfulness
which
Grandcourt
's
bearing
be
not
likely
to
dissipate
.
<EOS>
He
and
Lydia
occasionally
,
in
the
presence
of
the
servant
,
make
a
conventional
remark
;
otherwise
they
never
speak
;
and
the
stagnant
thought
in
Grandcourt
's
mind
all
the
while
be
of
his
own
infatuation
in
have
give
her
those
diamond
,
which
oblige
him
to
incur
the
nuisance
of
speak
about
them
.
<EOS>
He
have
an
ingrained
care
for
what
he
hold
to
belong
to
his
caste
,
and
about
property
he
like
to
be
lordly
;
also
he
have
a
consciousness
of
indignity
to
himself
in
have
to
ask
for
anything
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
but
however
he
may
assert
his
independence
of
Mrs.
Glasher
's
past
,
he
have
make
a
past
for
himself
which
be
a
strong
yoke
than
any
he
could
impose
.
<EOS>
He
must
ask
for
the
diamond
which
he
have
promise
to
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
they
be
alone
again
,
with
the
candle
above
them
,
face
to
face
with
each
other
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
look
at
his
watch
,
and
then
say
,
in
an
apparently
indifferent
drawl
,
"
there
be
one
thing
I
have
to
mention
,
Lydia
.
<EOS>
My
diamond
 
<EOS>
you
have
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
have
them
,
"
she
answer
promptly
,
rise
and
stand
with
her
arm
thrust
down
and
her
finger
thread
,
while
Grandcourt
sit
still
.
<EOS>
She
have
expect
the
topic
,
and
make
her
resolve
about
it
.
<EOS>
but
she
mean
to
carry
out
her
resolve
,
if
possible
,
without
exasperate
him
.
<EOS>
during
the
hour
of
silence
she
have
long
to
recall
the
word
which
have
only
widen
the
breach
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
in
this
house
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
not
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
say
you
keep
them
by
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
when
I
say
so
it
be
true
.
<EOS>
They
be
in
the
bank
at
Dudley
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
get
them
away
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
I
must
make
an
arrangement
for
your
deliver
them
to
some
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
make
no
arrangement
.
<EOS>
They
shall
be
deliver
to
the
person
you
intend
them
for
.
<EOS>
_
I
_
will
make
the
arrangement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
tell
you
that
I
would
give
them
up
to
your
wife
.
<EOS>
I
shall
keep
my
word
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
your
wife
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
foolery
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
with
undertoned
disgust
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
irritate
that
this
indulgence
of
Lydia
have
give
her
a
sort
of
mastery
over
him
in
spite
of
dependent
condition
.
  
<EOS>
She
do
not
speak
.
<EOS>
He
also
rise
now
,
but
stand
lean
against
the
mantle
-
piece
with
his
side
-
face
toward
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
diamond
must
be
deliver
to
me
before
my
marriage
,
"
he
begin
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
your
wedding
-
day
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
tenth
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
time
to
be
lose
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
where
do
you
go
after
the
marriage
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
reply
except
by
look
more
sullen
.
<EOS>
presently
he
say
,
"
You
must
appoint
a
day
before
then
,
to
get
them
from
the
bank
and
meet
me
 
or
somebody
else
I
will
commission
;
 
it
be
a
great
nuisance
,
mention
a
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
shall
not
do
that
.
<EOS>
They
shall
be
deliver
to
her
safely
.
<EOS>
I
shall
keep
my
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
you
mean
to
say
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
just
audibly
,
turn
to
face
her
,
"
that
you
will
not
do
as
I
tell
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
mean
that
,
"
be
the
answer
that
leap
out
,
while
her
eye
flash
close
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
poor
creature
be
immediately
conscious
that
if
her
word
have
any
effect
on
her
own
lot
,
the
effect
must
be
mischievous
,
and
may
nullify
all
the
remain
advantage
of
her
long
patience
.
<EOS>
but
the
word
have
be
speak
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
in
a
position
the
most
irritating
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
shake
her
nor
touch
her
hostilely
;
and
if
he
could
,
the
process
would
not
bring
his
mother
's
diamond
.
<EOS>
He
shrink
from
the
only
sort
of
threat
that
would
frighten
her
 
if
she
believe
it
.
<EOS>
and
in
general
,
there
be
nothing
he
hate
more
than
to
be
force
into
anything
like
violence
even
in
word
:
his
will
must
impose
itself
without
trouble
.
<EOS>
after
look
at
her
for
a
moment
,
he
turn
his
side
-
face
toward
her
again
,
lean
as
before
,
and
say
    
"
infernal
idiot
that
woman
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
will
you
not
tell
me
where
you
be
go
after
the
marriage
?
<EOS>
I
could
be
at
the
wedding
if
I
like
,
and
learn
in
that
way
,
"
say
Lydia
,
not
shrink
from
the
one
suicidal
form
of
threat
within
her
power
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
if
you
like
,
you
can
play
the
mad
woman
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
with
_
sotto
voce
_
scorn
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
you
will
wait
to
think
what
good
will
come
of
it
 
or
<EOS>
what
you
owe
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
in
a
state
of
disgust
and
embitterment
quite
new
in
the
history
of
their
relation
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
It
be
undeniable
that
this
woman
,
whose
life
he
have
allow
to
send
such
deep
sucker
into
his
,
have
a
terrible
power
of
annoyance
in
her
;
and
the
rash
hurry
of
his
proceeding
have
leave
her
opportunity
open
.
<EOS>
His
pride
see
very
ugly
possibility
threaten
it
,
and
he
stand
for
several
minute
in
silence
review
the
situation
 
consider
how
he
could
act
upon
her
.
<EOS>
unlike
himself
she
be
of
a
direct
nature
,
with
certain
simple
strongly
-
color
tendency
,
and
there
be
one
often
-
experience
effect
which
he
think
he
could
count
upon
now
.
<EOS>
as
Sir
Hugo
have
say
of
him
,
Grandcourt

how
to
play
his
card
upon
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
speak
again
,
but
look
at
his
watch
,
rang
the
bell
,
and
order
the
vehicle
to
be
bring
round
immediately
.
<EOS>
then
he
remove
farther
from
her
,
walk
as
if
in
expectation
of
a
summon
,
and
remain
silent
without
turn
his
eye
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
suffer
the
horrible
conflict
of
self
-
reproach
and
tenacity
.
<EOS>
She
see
beforehand
Grandcourt
leave
her
without
even
look
at
her
again
 
herself
leave
behind
in
lonely
uncertainty
 
hear
nothing
from
him
 
not
know
whether
she
have
do
her
child
harm
 
feel
that
she
have
perhaps
make
him
hate
her
;
 
all
the
wretchedness
of
a
creature
who
have
defeat
her
own
motive
.
<EOS>
and
yet
she
could
not
bear
to
give
up
a
purpose
which
be
a
sweet
morsel
to
her
vindictiveness
.
<EOS>
if
she
have
not
be
a
mother
she
would
willingly
have
sacrifice
herself
to
her
revenge
 
to
what
she
feel
to
be
the
justice
of
hinder
another
from
get
happiness
by
willingly
give
her
over
to
misery
.
<EOS>
the
two
dominant
passion
be
at
struggle
.
<EOS>
She
must
satisfy
them
both
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
let
us
part
in
anger
,
Henleigh
,
"
she
begin
,
without
change
her
voice
or
attitude
:
"
it
be
a
very
little
thing
I
ask
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
refuse
to
give
anything
up
<EOS>
that
you
call
yours
<EOS>
it
would
be
different
:
that
would
be
a
reason
for
treat
me
as
if
you
hate
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
ask
such
a
little
thing
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
tell
me
where
you
be
go
on
the
wedding
-
day
<EOS>
I
will
take
care
that
the
diamond
shall
be
deliver
to
her
without
scandal
.
<EOS>
without
scandal
,
"
she
repeat
entreatingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
such
preposterous
whim
make
a
woman
odious
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
not
give
way
in
look
or
movement
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
use
of
talk
to
mad
people
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
be
foolish
 
loneliness
have
make
me
foolish
 
indulge
me
.
"
<EOS>
Sobs
rise
as
she
speak
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
indulge
me
in
this
one
folly
I
will
be
very
meek
 
I
will
never
trouble
you
.
"
<EOS>
She
burst
into
hysterical
crying
,
and
say
again
almost
with
a
scream
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
very
meek
after
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
strange
mixture
of
acting
and
reality
in
this
passion
.
<EOS>
She
keep
hold
of
her
purpose
as
a
child
may
tighten
its
hand
over
a
small
steal
thing
,
cry
and
deny
all
the
while
.
<EOS>
even
Grandcourt
be
work
upon
by
surprise
:
this
capricious
wish
,
this
childish
violence
,
be
as
unlike
Lydia
's
bearing
as
it
be
incongruous
with
her
person
.
<EOS>
both
have
always
have
a
stamp
of
dignity
on
them
.
<EOS>
yet
she
seem
more
manageable
in
this
state
than
in
her
former
attitude
of
defiance
.
<EOS>
He
come
close
up
to
her
again
,
and
say
,
in
his
low
imperious
tone
,
"
be
quiet
,
and
hear
what
I
tell
you
,
I
will
never
forgive
you
if
you
present
yourself
again
and
make
a
scene
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
press
her
handkerchief
against
her
face
,
and
when
she
could
speak
firmly
say
,
in
the
muffled
voice
that
follow
sob
,
"
I
will
not
 
if
you
will
let
me
have
my
way
 
<EOS>
I
promise
you
not
to
thrust
myself
forward
again
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
break
my
word
to
you
 
how
many
have
you
broken
to
me
?
<EOS>
when
you
give
me
the
diamond
to
wear
you
be
not
think
of
have
another
wife
.
<EOS>
and
I
now
give
them
up
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
reproach
you
 
<EOS>
I
only
ask
you
to
let
me
give
them
up
in
my
own
way

<EOS>
have
I
not
borne
it
well
?
<EOS>
everything
be
to
be
take
away
from
me
,
and
when
I
ask
for
a
straw
,
a
chip
 
<EOS>
you
deny
it
me
.
<EOS>
"
She
have
speak
rapidly
,
but
after
a
little
pause
she
say
more
slowly
,
her
voice
free
from
its
muffled
tone
:
"
I
will
not
bear
to
have
it
deny
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
have
a
baffling
sense
that
he
have
to
deal
with
something
like
madness
;
he
could
only
govern
by
give
way
.
<EOS>
the
servant
come
to
say
the
fly
be
ready
.
<EOS>
when
the
door
be
shut
again
Grandcourt
say
sullenly
,
"
We
be
go
to
Ryelands
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
They
shall
be
deliver
to
her
there
,
"
say
Lydia
,
with
decision
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
I
be
go
.
"
<EOS>
He
feel
no
inclination
even
to
take
her
hand
:
she
have
annoy
him
too
sorely
.
<EOS>
but
now
that
she
have
gain
her
point
,
she
be
prepared
to
humble
herself
that
she
may
propitiate
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
forgive
me
;
I
will
never
vex
you
again
,
"
she
say
,
with
beseech
look
.
<EOS>
Her
inward
voice
say
distinctly
 
"
It
be
only
I
who
have
to
forgive
.
"
<EOS>
yet
she
be
oblige
to
ask
forgiveness
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
keep
that
promise
.
<EOS>
You
have
make
me
feel
uncommonly
ill
with
your
folly
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
apparently
choose
this
statement
as
the
strong
possible
use
of
language
.
  
<EOS>
"
poor
thing
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Lydia
,
with
a
faint
smile
;
 
be
he
aware
of
the
minor
fact
that
he
make
her
feel
ill
this
morning
?
  
<EOS>
but
with
the
quick
transition
natural
to
her
,
she
be
now
ready
to
coax
him
if
he
would
let
her
,
that
they
may
part
in
some
degree
reconcile
.
<EOS>
She
venture
to
lay
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
,
and
he
do
not
move
away
from
her
:
she
have
so
far
succeed
in
alarm
him
,
that
he
be
not
sorry
for
these
proof
of
return
subjection
.
  
<EOS>
"

"
she
say
,
soothingly
,
take
the
case
from
his
breast
-
pocket
and
opening
it
.
  
<EOS>
amidst
such
caressing
sign
of
mutual
fear
they
part
.
<EOS>
the
effect
that
cling
and
gnaw
within
Grandcourt
be
a
sense
of
imperfect
mastery
.

the

no

she
should
feel
the
parting
from
a
daughter
who
be
the
flower
of
her

and
of

<EOS>
It

why

agree
that
as

figure

carriage
<EOS>
she
be
worthy
to

:
as
to
face
,
perhaps
it
may
be
think
that
a
title
require
something
more
rosy

but
the
bridegroom
himself
not

colored

very
much

<EOS>
the
match
be
the
more
complete

<EOS>
anyhow
he
must
be
very
fond
of
her

and
it
be
to
be
hope
that
he
would
never
cast
it
up
to
her
that
she

the

Gwendolen

never

more
elasticity
in
her
bearing

more

in
her
long
brown
glance
:
she
have
the
brilliancy
of
strong
excitement
,
which
will
sometimes
come
even
from
pain

<EOS>
It
be
not

however

that
she

feel
:
she
have
work
herself
up

much
the

in
which
she
stand
at
the
gambling

table
when
Deronda
be
look
at
her
,
and
she
begin
to
lose

<EOS>
there
be
an
enjoyment
in

:
whatever
uneasiness
a
grow
conscience
have
create
be
disregard
as
an
ailment
may
have
be
,
amidst
the
gratification
of
that
ambitious
vanity
and
desire
for
luxury
within
her
which
it
would
take
a
great
deal
of
slow
poisoning
to
kill
.
<EOS>
this
morning
she
could
not
have
say
truly
that
she
repent
her
acceptance
of
Grandcourt
,
or
that
any
fear
in
hazy
perspective
could
hinder
the
glowing
effect

the
immediate

the
central
object

<EOS>
that
she
be
do
something
wrong
 
that
a
punishment
may
be
hang
over
her
 
that
the
woman
to
whom
she
have
give
a
promise
and
break
it
,
be
think
of
her
in
bitterness
and
misery
with
a
just
reproach
 
that
Deronda
with
his
way
of
look
into
thing
very
likely
despise
her
for

Grandcourt
,
as
he
have
despise
her
for

half

be
that
agitate
experience

this
morning

<EOS>
no
:
it
be
surmount
and
thrust
down
with
a
sort
of
exulting
defiance
as
she
feel
herself
stand
at
the
game
of
life
with
many
eye
upon
her
,
dare
everything
to
win
much
 
or
if
to
lose
,
still
with

and
a
sense
of
importance

<EOS>
but
this
morning
a
lose
destiny
for

all
the
official
strength
of

<EOS>
that
intoxication
of
youthful
egoism
out
of
which
she
have
be
shake
by
trouble
,
humiliation
,
and
a
new
sense
of
culpability
,
have
return
upon
her
under
a
newly

feed
strength
of
the
old
fume

<EOS>
She
do
not
in

the
ideal

tearful

tremulous
bride

<EOS>
Poor
Gwendolen

<EOS>
she

and
yet
,
too
<EOS>
,
there
be
an
under

consciousness
of
her
that
she

"

take
the

say
Gwendolen
,
shake
her
head
,
with
a
bright
smile
.
<EOS>
"
willingly
you
would
bear
it
,
but
always
sorrowfully
.
<EOS>
sorrow
be
your
sauce
;
you
can
take
nothing
without
it
.
"
<EOS>
then
,
clasp
her
mother
's
shoulder
and
rain
kiss
first
on
one
cheek
and
then
on
the
other
between
her
word
,
she
say
,
gaily
,
"
and
you
shall
sorrow
over
my
have
everything
at
my
beck
   
and
enjoy
everything
glorious
 
splendid
house
 
and
horse
 
and
diamond
,
I
shall
have
diamond
 
and
go
to
court
 
and
be
Lady
certainly
 
and
Lady
perhaps
 
and
grand
here
 
and
tantivy
there
 
and
always
love
you
better
than
anybody
else
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
sweet
child
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
shall
not
be
jealous
if
you
love
your
husband
better
;
and
he
will
expect
to
be
first
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
thrust
out
her
lip
and
chin
with
a
pretty
grimace
,
say
,
"
rather
a
ridiculous
expectation
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
do
not
mean
to
treat
him
ill
,
unless
he
deserve
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
then
the
two
fall
into
a
cling
embrace
,
and
Gwendolen
could
not
hinder
a
rise
sob
when
she
say
,
"
I
wish
you
be
go
with
me
,
mamma
.

"
  
<EOS>
but
the
slight
dew
on
her
long
eyelash
only
make
her
the
more
charming
when
she
give
her
hand
to
Grandcourt
to
be
lead
to
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
the
rector
look
in
on
her
to
give
a
final
"
good
-
bye
;
God
bless
you
;
we
shall
see
you
again
before
long
,
"
and
then
return
to
Mrs.
Davilow
,
say
half
cheerfully
,
half
solemnly
    
<EOS>
"
let
us
be
thankful
,
Fanny
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
a
position
well
suited
to
her
,
and
beyond
what
I
should

to

for

choose
more

there
be
a
railway
journey
of
some
fifty
mile
before
the
new
husband
and
wife
reach
the
station
near
Ryelands
.
<EOS>
the
sky
have
veil
itself
since
the
morning
,
and
it
be
hardly
more
than
twilight
when
they
enter
the
park
-
gate
,
but
<EOS>
still
Gwendolen
,
look
out
of
the
carriage
-
window
as
they
drive
rapidly
along
,
could
see
the
grand
outline
and
the
near
beauty
of
the
scene
 
<EOS>
the
long
winding
drive
border
with
evergreens
back
by
huge
gray
stem
:
then
the
opening
of
wide
grassy
space
and
undulation
stud
with
dark
clump
;
till
at
last
come
a
wide
level
where
the
white
house
could
be
see
,
with
a
hang
wood
for
a
back
-
ground
,
and
the
rise
and
sink
balustrade
of
a
terrace
in
front
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
have
be
at
her
lively
during
the
journey
,
chat
incessantly
,
ignore
any
change
in
their
mutual
position
since
yesterday
;
and
Grandcourt
have
be
rather
ecstatically
quiescent
,
while
she
turn
his
gentle
seizure
of
her
hand
into
a
grasp
of
his
hand
by
both
her
,
with
an
increased
vivacity
as
of
a
kitten
that
will
not
sit
quiet
to
be
pet
.
<EOS>
She
be
really
get
somewhat
febrile
in
her
excitement
;
and
now
in
this
drive
through
the
park
her
usual
susceptibility
to
change
of
light
and
scenery
help
to
make
her
heart
palpitate
newly
.
<EOS>
be
it
at
the
novelty
simply
,
or
the
almost
incredible
fulfilment
about
to
be
give
to
her
girlish
dream
of
be
"
<EOS>
somebody
"
 
walk
through
her
own
furlong
of
corridor
and
under
her
own
ceiling
of
an
out
-
of
-
sight
loftiness
,
where
her
own
paint
spring
be
shed
paint
flower
,
and
her
own
fore
-
shorten
Zephyrs
be
blow
their
trumpet
over
her
;
while
her
own
servant
,
lackey
in
clothing
but
man
in
bulk
and
shape
,
be
as
nought
in
her
presence
,
and
revere
the
propriety
of
her
insolence
to
them
:
 
be
in
short
the
heroine
of
an
admired
play
without
the
pain
of
art
?
<EOS>
be
it
alone
the
closeness
of
this
fulfilment
which
make
her
heart
flutter
?
<EOS>
or
be
it
some
dim
forecast
,
the
insistent
penetration
of
suppress
experience
,
mix
the
expectation
of
a
triumph
with
the
dread
of
a
crisis
?
<EOS>
Hers
be
one
of
the
nature
in
which
exultation
inevitably
carry
an
infusion
of
dread
ready
to
curdle
and
declare
itself
.
  
<EOS>
She
fall
silent
in
spite
of
herself
as
they
approach
the
gate
,
and
when
her
husband
say
,
"
here
we
be
at
home
!
"
<EOS>
and
for
the
first
time
kiss
her
on
the
lip
,
she
hardly
know
of
it
:
it
be
no
more
than
the
passive
acceptance
of
a
greeting
in
the
midst
of
an
absorbing
show
.
<EOS>
be
not
all
her
hurrying
life
of
the
last
three
month
a
show
,
in
which
her
consciousness
be
a
wonder
spectator
?
<EOS>
after
the
half
-
willful
excitement
of
the
day
,
a
numbness
have
come
over
her
personality
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
brilliant
light
in
the
hall
 
<EOS>
warmth
,
matting
,
carpet
,
full
-
length
portrait
,
olympian
statue
,
assiduous
servant

not

however
:
only
a
few
from
Diplow
in
addition
to
those
constantly
in
charge
of
the
house
;
and
Gwendolen
's
new
maid
,
who
have
come
with
her
,
be
take
under
guidance
by
the
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
feel
herself
be
lead
by
Grandcourt
along
a
subtly
-
scent
corridor
,
into
an
ante
-
room
where
she
see
an
open
doorway
send
out
a
rich
glow
of
light
and
color
.
  
<EOS>
"
these
be

den

Grandcourt

<EOS>
"
You
will
like

be
quiet
here

dinner

<EOS>
We
shall
dine
early

"
  
<EOS>
He
press
her
hand
to
his
lip
and
move
away
,
more
in
love
than
he
have
ever
expect
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
yield
up
her
hat
and
mantle
,
throw
herself
into
a
chair
by
the
glowing
hearth
,
and
see
herself
repeat
in
glass
panel
with
all
her
faint
-
green
satin
surrounding
.
<EOS>
the
housekeeper
have
pass
into
this
boudoir
from
the
adjoining
dressing
-
room
and
seem
disposed
to
linger
,
Gwendolen
think
,
in
order
to
look
at
the
new
mistress
of
Ryelands
,
who
,
however
,
be
impatient
for
solitude
say
to
her
,
"
Will
you
tell
Hudson
when
she
have
put
out
my
dress
to
leave
everything
?
<EOS>
I
shall
not
want
her
again
,
unless
I
ring
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
housekeeper
,
come
forward
,
say
,
"
here
be
a
packet
,
madam
,
which
I
be
order
to
give
into
nobody
's
hand
but
<EOS>
yours
,
when
you
be
alone
.
<EOS>
the
person
who
bring
it
say
it
be
a
present
particularly
order
by
Mr.
Grandcourt
;
but
he
be
not
to
know
of
its
arrival
till
he
see
you
wear
it
.
<EOS>
excuse
me
,
madam
<EOS>
;
I
feel
it
right
to
obey
order
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
take
the
packet
and
let
it
lie
on
her
lap
till
she
hear
the
door
close
.
<EOS>
It
come
into
her
mind
that
the
packet
may
contain
the
diamond
which
Grandcourt
have
speak
of
as
be
deposit
somewhere
and
to
be
give
to
her
on
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
in
this
moment
of
confused
feeling
and
creep
luxurious
languor
she
be
glad
of
this
diversion
 
glad
of
such
an
event
as
have
her
own
diamond
to
try
on
.
  
<EOS>
within
all
the
seal
paper
covering
be
a
box
,
but
within
the
box
there
_
be
_
a
jewel
-
case
;
and
now
she
feel
no
doubt
that
she
have
the
diamond
.
<EOS>
but
on
open
the
case
,
in
the
same
instant
that
she
see
them
gleam
she
see
a
letter
lie
above
them
.
<EOS>
She
know
the
handwriting
of
the
address
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
an
adder
have
lain
on
them
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
give
a
leap
which
seem
to
have
spend
all
her
strength
;
and
as
she
open
the
bit
of
thin
paper
,
it
shake
with
the
trembling
of
her
hand
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
legible
as
print
,
and
thrust
its
word
upon
her
.
      
<EOS>
these
diamond
,
which
be
once
give
with
ardent
love
to
Lydia
    
Glasher
<EOS>
,
she
pass
on
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
break
your
word
to
her
,
that
    
you
may
possess
what
be
hers
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
think
of
be
happy
,
as
    
she
once
be
,
and
of
have
beautiful
child
such
as
hers
,
who
will
    
thrust
hers
aside
.
<EOS>
God
be
too
just
for
that
.
<EOS>
the
man
you
have
marry
    
have
a
withered
heart
.
<EOS>
His
good
young
love
be
mine
:
you
could
not
take
    
that
from
me
when
you
take
the
rest
.
<EOS>
It
be
dead
:
but
I
be
the
grave
    
in
which
your
chance
of
happiness
be
bury
as
well
as
mine
.
<EOS>
You
have
    
your
warning
.
<EOS>
You
have
choose
to
injure
me
and
my
child
.
<EOS>
He
have
    
mean
to
marry
me
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
marry
me
at
last
,
if
you
have
not
    
break
your
word
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
your
punishment
.
<EOS>
I
desire
it
with
all
    
my
soul
.
      
<EOS>
Will
you
give
him
this
letter
to
set
him
against
me
and
ruin
us
    
more
 
me
and
my
child
?
<EOS>
Shall
you
like
to
stand
before
your
husband
    
with
these
diamond
on
you
,
and
these
word
of
mine
in
his
thought
and
    
yours
?
<EOS>
Will
he
think
you
have
any
right
to
complain
when
he
have
make
    
you
miserable
?
<EOS>
You
take
him
with
your
eye
open
.
<EOS>
the
willing
wrong
you
    
have
do
me
will
be
your
curse
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
at
first
as
if
Gwendolen
's
eye
be
spell
-
bind
in
read
the
horrible
word
of
the
letter
over
and
over
again
as
a
doom
of
penance
;
but
suddenly
a
new
spasm
of
terror
make
her
lean
forward
and
stretch
out
the
paper
toward
the
fire
,
<EOS>
lest
accusation
and
proof
at
once
should
meet
all
eye
.
<EOS>
It
fly
like
a
feather
from
her
tremble
finger
and
be
catch
up
in
a
great
draught
of
flame
.
<EOS>
in
her
movement
the
casket
fall
on
the
floor
and
the
diamond
roll
out
.
<EOS>
She
take
no
notice
,
but
fall
back
in
her
chair
again
helpless
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
see
the
reflection
of
herself
then
;
they
be
like
so
many
woman
petrify
white
;
but
come
near
herself
you
may
have
see
the
tremor
in
her
lip
and
hand
.
<EOS>
She
sit
so
for
a
long
while
,
know
little
more
than
that
she
be
feel
ill
,
and
that
those
write
word
keep
repeat
themselves
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
truly
here
be
poison
gem
,
and
the
poison
have
enter
into
this
poor
young
creature
.
  
<EOS>
after
that
long
while
,
there
be
a
tap
at
the
door
and
Grandcourt
enter
,
dress
for
dinner
.
<EOS>
the
sight
of
him
bring
a
new
nervous
shock
,
and
Gwendolen
scream
again
and
again
with
hysterical
violence
.
<EOS>
He
have
expect
to
see
her
dress
and
smile
,
ready
to
be
lead
down
.
<EOS>
He
see
her
pallid
,
shriek
as
it
seem
with
terror
,
the
jewel
scatter
around
her
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
be
it
a
fit
of
madness
?
  
<EOS>
in
some
form
or
other
the
fury
have
cross
his
threshold
.
        
<EOS>
in
all
age
it
hath
be
a
favorite
text
that
a
potent
love
hath
the
    
nature
of
an
isolate
fatality
,
whereto
the
mind
's
opinion
and
wonte
    
resolve
be
altogether
alien
;
as
,
for
example
,
Daphnis
his
frenzy
,
    
wherein
it
have
little
avail
him
to
have
be
convince
of
Heraclitus
    
his
doctrine
;
or
the
philtre
-
breed
passion
of
Tristan
,
who
,
though
he
    
have
be
as
deep
as
Duns
Scotus
,
would
have
have
his
reasoning
mar
    
by
that
cup
too
much
;
or
Romeo
in
his
sudden
taking
for
Juliet
,
    
wherein
any
objection
he
may
have
hold
against
Ptolemy
have
make
    
little
difference
to
his
discourse
under
the
balcony
.
<EOS>
yet
all
love
be
    
not
such
,
even
though
potent
;
nay
,
this
passion
hath
as
large
scope
as
    
any
for
ally
itself
with
every
operation
of
the
soul
:
so
that
it
    
shall
acknowledge
an
effect
from
the
imagined
light
of
unproven
    
firmament
,
and
have
its
scale
set
to
the
grander
orbit
of
what
hath
    
be
and
shall
be
.
   
<EOS>
Deronda
,
on
his
return
to
town
,
could
assure
Sir
Hugo
of
his
have
lodge
in
Grandcourt
's
mind
a
distinct
understanding
that
he
could
get
fifty
thousand
pound
by
give
up
a
prospect
which
be
probably
distant
,
and
not
absolutely
certain
;
but
he
have
no
further
sign
of
Grandcourt
's
disposition
in
the
matter
than
that
he
be
evidently
inclined
to
keep
up
friendly
communication
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
do
you
think
of
the
future
bride
on
a
near
survey
?
"
say
Sir
Hugo
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
better
of
her
than
I
do
in
Leubronn
.
<EOS>
Roulette
be
not
a
good
setting
for
her
;
it
bring
out
something
of
the
demon
.
<EOS>
at
Diplow
she
seem
much
more
womanly
and
attractive
 
less
hard
and
self
-
possess
.
<EOS>
I
think
her
mouth
and
eye
have
quite
a
different
expression
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
flirt
with
her
too
much
,
Dan
,
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
mean
to
be
agreeably
playful
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
make
Grandcourt
savage
when
they
come
to
the
Abbey
at
Christmas
,
it
will
interfere
with
my
affair

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
stay
in
town
,
sir

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no

<EOS>
Lady
Mallinger
and
the
child
can
not
do
without
you
at
Christmas
.
<EOS>
only
do
not
make
mischief
 
unless
you
can
get
up
a
duel
,
and
manage
to
shoot
Grandcourt
,
which
may
be
worth
a
little
inconvenience
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

you
ever
see
me
flirt

say
Deronda

<EOS>
"
oh
,
have
not
I
,
though
?
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
provokingly
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
always
look
tenderly
at
the
woman
,
and
talk
to
them
in
a
jesuitical
way
.
<EOS>
You
be
a
dangerous
young
fellow
 
a
kind
of
lovelace
who
will
make
the
Clarissas
run
after
you
instead
of
you
run
after
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
what
be
the
use
of
be
exasperate
at
a
tasteless
joke
?
 
<EOS>
only
the
exasperation
come
before
the
reflection
on
utility
.
<EOS>
few
friendly
remark
be
more
annoying
than
the
information
that
we
be
always
seem
to
do
what
we
never
mean
to
do
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
's
notion
of
flirting
,
it
be
to
be
hope
,
be
rather
peculiar
;
for
his
own
part
,
Deronda
be
sure
that
he
have
never
flirt
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
glad
that
the
baronet
have
no
knowledge
about
the
repurchase
of
Gwendolen
's
necklace
to
feed
his
taste
for
this
kind
of
rallying
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
be
on
his
guard
in
future
;
for
example
,
in
his
behavior
at
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
,
where
he
be
about
to
pay
his
first
visit
since
his
arrival
from
Leubronn
.
<EOS>
for
Mirah
be
certainly
a
creature
in
whom
it
be
difficult
not
to
show
a
tender
kind
of
interest
both
by
look
and
speech
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
have
not
fail
to
send
Deronda
a
report
of
Mirah
's
well
-
being
in
her
family
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
get
fonder
of
her
every
day
,
"
she
have
write
.
"
<EOS>
at
breakfast
-
time
we
all
look
toward
the
door
with
expectation
to
see
her
come
in
;
and
we
watch
her
and
listen
to
her
as
if
she
be
a
native
from
a
new
country
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
hear
a
word
from
her
lip
that
give
me
a
doubt
about
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
quite
contented
and
full
of
gratitude
.
<EOS>
My
daughter
be
learn
from
her
,
and
they
hope
to
get
her
other
pupil
;
for
she
be
anxious
not
to
eat
the
bread
of
idleness
,
but
to
work
,
like
my
girl
.
<EOS>
Mab
say
our
life
have
become
like
a
fairy
tale
,
and
all
she
be
afraid
of
be
that
Mirah
will
turn
into
a
nightingale
again
and
fly
away
from
us
.
<EOS>
Her
voice
be
just
perfect
:
not
loud
and
strong
,
but
search
and
melt
,
like
the
thought
of
what
have
be
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
way
old
people
like
me
feel
a
beautiful
voice
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Meyrick
do
not
enter
into
particular
which
would
have
require
her
to
say
that
Amy
and
Mab
,
who
have
accompany
Mirah
to
the
synagogue
,
find
the
jewish
faith
less
reconcilable
with
their
wish
in
her
case
than
in
that
of
Scott
's
Rebecca
.
<EOS>
They
keep
silence
out
of
delicacy
to
Mirah
,
with
whom
her
religion
be
too
tender
<EOS>
a
subject
to
be
touch
lightly
;
but
after
a
while
Amy
,
who
be
much
of
a
practical
reformer
,
could
not
restrain
a
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
excuse
me
,
Mirah
,
but
<EOS>
_
do
_
<EOS>
it
seem
quite
right
to
you
that
the
woman
should
sit
behind
rail
in
a
gallery
apart
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
never
think
of
anything
else
,
"
say
Mirah
,
with
mild
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
like
better
to
see
the
man
with
their
hat
on
?
"
say
Mab
,
cautiously
propose
the
small
item
of
difference
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
.
<EOS>
I
like
what
I
have
always
see
there
,
because
it
bring
back
to
me
the
same
feeling
 
<EOS>
the
feeling
I
would
not
part
with
for
anything
else
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
after
this
,
any
criticism
,
whether
of
doctrine
or
practice
,
would
have
seem
to
these
generous
little
people
an
inhospitable
cruelty
.
<EOS>
Mirah
's
religion
be
of
one
fibre
with
her
affection
,
and
have
never
present
itself
to
her
as
a
set
of
proposition
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
say
herself
she
be
a
very
bad
Jewess
,
and
do
not
half
know
her
people
's
religion
,
"
say
Amy
,
when
Mirah
be
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
perhaps
it
would
gradually
melt
away
from
her
,
and
she
would
pass
into
Christianity
like
the
rest
of
the
world
,
if
she
get
to
love
us
very
much
,
and
never
find
her
mother
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
strange
to
be
of
the
Jews
'
religion
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
oh
,
oh
!
"
cry
Mab
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
be
not
such
a
hideous
Christian
.
<EOS>
how
can
an
ugly
Christian
,
who
be
always
drop
her
work
,
convert
a
beautiful
Jewess
,
who
have
not
a
fault
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
wicked
of
me
,
"
say
shrewd
Kate
,
"
but
I
can
not
help
wish
that
her
mother
may
not
be
find

<EOS>
there
may
be
something
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
it
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
Mirah
be
cut
out
after
the
pattern
of
her
mother
.
<EOS>
and
what
a
joy
it
would
be
to
her
to
have
such
a
daughter
bring
back
again
!
<EOS>
but
a
mother
's
feeling
be
not
worth
reckon
,
I
suppose
"
(
she
shoot
a
mischievous
glance
at
her
own
daughter
)
,
"
and
a
dead
mother
be
worth
more
<EOS>
that
a
live
one
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
and
so
she
may
be
,
little
mother
,
"
say
Kate
;
"
but
we
would
rather
hold
you
cheap
,
and
have
you
alive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
not
only
the
meyrick
,
whose
various
knowledge
have
be
acquire
by
the
irregular
foraging
to
which
clever
girl
have
usually
be
reduce
,
but
Deronda
himself
,
with
all
his
masculine
instruction
,
have
be
rouse
by
this
apparition
of
Mirah
to
the
consciousness
of
know
hardly
anything
about
modern
Judaism
or
the
inner
jewish
history
.
<EOS>
the
Chosen
People
have
be
commonly
treat
as
a
people
choose
for
the
sake
of
somebody
else
;
and
their
thinking
as
something
(
no
matter
exactly
what
)
<EOS>
that
ought
to
have
be
entirely
otherwise
;
and
Deronda
,
like
his
neighbor
,
have
regard
Judaism
as
a
sort
of
eccentric
fossilized
form
which
an
accomplished
man
may
dispense
with
studying
,
and
leave
to
specialist
.
<EOS>
but
Mirah
,
with
her
terrified
flight
from
one
parent
,
and
her
yearning
after
the
other
,
have
flash
on
him
the
hitherto
neglect
reality
that
Judaism
be
something
still
throb
in
human
life
,
still
make
for
them
the
only
conceivable
vesture
of
the
world
;
and
in
the
idling
excursion
on
which
he
immediately
afterward
set
out
with
Sir
Hugo
he
begin
to
look
for
the
outside
of
synagogue
,
and
the
title
of
book
about
the
Jews
.
<EOS>
this
awakening
of
a
new
interest
 
<EOS>
this
passing
from
the
supposition
that
we
hold
the
right
opinion
on
a
subject
we
be
careless
about
,
to
a
sudden
care
for
it
,
and
a
sense
that
our
opinion
be
ignorance
 
be
an
effectual
remedy
for
_
ennui
_
,
which
,
unhappily
,
can
not
be
secure
on
a
physician
's
prescription
;
but
Deronda
have
carry
it
with
him
,
and
endure
his
week
of
lounge
all
the
well
.
<EOS>
It
be
on
this
journey
that
he
first
enter
a
jewish
synagogue
 
at
Frankfort
 
where
his
party
rest
on
a
Friday
.
<EOS>
in
explore
the
Juden
-
gasse
,
which
he
have
see
long
before
,
he
remember
well
enough
its
picturesque
old
house
;
what
his
eye
chiefly
dwelt
on
now
be
the
human
type
there
;
and
his
thought
,
busily
connect
them
with
the
past
phase
of
their
race
,
stir
that
fibre
of
historic
sympathy
which
have
help
to
determine
in
him
certain
trait
worth
mention
for
those
who
be
interested
in
his
future
.
<EOS>
true
,
when
a
young
man
have
a
fine
person
,
no
eccentricity
of
manner
,
the
education
of
a
gentleman
,
and
a
present
income
,
it
be
not
customary
to
feel
a
pry
curiosity
about
his
way
of
thinking
,
or
his
peculiar
taste
.
<EOS>
He
may
very
well
be
settle
in
life
as
an
agreeable
clever
young
fellow
without
pass
a
special
examination
on
those
head
.
<EOS>
later
,
when
he
be
get
rather
slovenly
and
portly
,
his
peculiarity
be
more
distinctly
discern
,
and
it
be
take
as
a
mercy
if
they
be
not
highly
objectionable
.
<EOS>
but
any
one
wish
to
understand
the
effect
of
after
-
event
on
Deronda
<EOS>
should
know
a
little
more
of
what
he
be
at
five
-
and
-
twenty
than
be
evident
in
ordinary
intercourse
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
that
the
very
vividness
of
his
impression
have
often
make
him
the
more
enigmatic
to
his
friend
,
and
have
contribute
to
an
apparent
indefiniteness
in
his
sentiment
.
<EOS>
His
early
-
wakened
sensibility
and
reflectiveness
have
develop
into
a
many
-
sided
sympathy
,
which
threaten
to
hinder
any
persistent
course
of
action
:
as
soon
as
he
take
up
any
antagonism
,
though
only
in
thought
,
he
seem
to
himself
like
the
Sabine
warrior
in
the
memorable
story
 
with
nothing
to
meet
his
spear
but
flesh
of
his
flesh
,
and
object
that
he
love
.
<EOS>
His
imagination
have
so
work
itself
to
the
habit
of
see
thing
as
they
probably
appear
to
other
,
that
a
strong
partisanship
,
unless
it
be
against
an
immediate
oppression
,
have
become
an
insincerity
for
him
.
<EOS>
His
plenteous
,
flexible
sympathy
have
end
by
fall
into
one
current
with
that
reflective
analysis
which
tend
to
neutralize
sympathy
.
<EOS>
few
man
be
able
to
keep
themselves
clear
of
vice
than
he
;
yet
he
hate
vice
mildly
,
be
use
to
think
of
them
less
in
the
abstract
than
as
a
part
of
mix
human
nature
have
an
individual
history
,
which
it
be
the
bent
of
his
mind
to
trace
with
understanding
and
pity
.
<EOS>
with
the
same
innate
balance
he
be
fervidly
democratic
in
his
feeling
for
the
multitude
,
and
yet
,
through
his
affection
and
imagination
,
intensely
conservative
;
voracious
of
speculation
on
government
and
religion
,
yet
loth
to
part
with
long
-
sanction
form
which
,
for
him
,
be
quick
with
memory
and
sentiment
that
no
argument
could
lay
dead
.
<EOS>
We
fall
on
the
lean
side
;
and
Deronda
suspect
himself
of
love
too
well
the
lose
cause
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
martyrdom
change
side
,
and
he
be
in
danger
of
change
with
it
,
have
a
strong
repugnance
to
take
up
that
clue
of
success
which
the
order
of
the
world
often
force
upon
us
and
make
it
treason
against
the
common
weal
to
reject
.
<EOS>
and
yet
his
fear
of
fall
into
an
unreasone
narrow
hatred
make
a
check
for
him
:
he
apologize
for
the
heir
of
privilege
;
he
shrink
with
dislike
from
the
loser
's
bitterness
and
the
denunciatory
tone
of
the
unaccepted
innovator
.
<EOS>
a
too
reflective
and
diffusive
sympathy
be
in
danger
of
paralyze
in
him
that
indignation
against
wrong
and
that
selectness
of
fellowship
which
be
the
condition
of
moral
force
;
and
in
the
last
few
year
of
confirm
manhood
he
have
become
so
keenly
aware
of
this
that
what
he
most
long
for
be
either
some
external
event
,
or
some
inward
light
,
that
would
urge
him
into
a
definite
line
of
action
,
and
compress
his
wander
energy
.
<EOS>
He
be
cease
to
care
for
knowledge
 
<EOS>
he
have
no
ambition
for
practice
 
unless
they
could
both
be
gather
up
into
one
current
with
his
emotion
;
and
he
dread
,
as
if
it
be
a
dwelling
-
place
of
lose
soul
,
that
dead
anatomy
of
culture
which
turn
the
universe
into
a
mere
ceaseless
answer
to
query
,
and
know
,
not
everything
,
but
everything
else
about
everything
 
as
if
one
should
be
ignorant
of
nothing
concern
the
scent
of
violet
except
the
scent
itself
for
which
one
have
no
nostril
.
<EOS>
but
how
and
whence
be
the
need
event
to
come
?
 
<EOS>
the
influence
that
would
justify
partiality
,
and
make
him
what
he
long
to
be
,
yet
be
unable
to
make
himself
 
an
organic
part
of
social
life
,
instead
of
roam
in
it
like
a
yearning
disembodied
spirit
,
stir
with
a
vague
social
passion
,
but
without
fix
local
habitation
to
render
fellowship
real
?
<EOS>
to
make
a
little
difference
for
the
well
be
what
he
be
not
content
to
live
without
;
but
how
to
make
it
?
<EOS>
It
be
one
thing
to
see
your
road
,
another
to
cut
it
.
<EOS>
He
find
some
of
the
fault
in
his
birth
and
the
way
he
have
be
bring
up
,
which
have
lay
no
special
demand
on
him
and
have
give
him
no
fixed
relationship
except
one
of
a
doubtful
kind
;
but
he
do
not
attempt
to
hide
from
himself
that
he
have
fall
into
a
meditative
numbness
,
and
be
glide
farther
and
farther
from
that
life
of
practically
energetic
sentiment
which
he
would
have
proclaim
(
if
he
have
be
incline
to
proclaim
anything
)
to
be
the
good
of
all
life
,
and
for
himself
the
only
way
worth
live
.
<EOS>
He
want
some
way
of
keep
emotion
and
its
progeny
of
sentiment
 
which
make
the
savor
of
life
 
substantial
and
strong
in
the
face
of
a
reflectiveness
that
threaten
to
nullify
all
difference
.
<EOS>
to
pound
the
object
of
sentiment
into
small
dust
,
yet
keep
sentiment
alive
and
active
,
be
something
like
the
famous
recipe
for
make
cannon
 
to
first
take
a
round
hole
and
then
enclose
it
with
iron
;
whatever
you
do
keep
fast
hold
of
your
round
hole
.
<EOS>
yet
how
distinguish
what
our
will
may
wisely
save
in
its
completeness
,
from
the
heaping
of
cat
-
mummy
and
the
expensive
cult
of
enshrine
putrefaction
?
  
<EOS>
something
like
this
be
the
common
under
-
current
in
Deronda
's
mind
while
he
be
read
law
or
imperfectly
attend
to
polite
conversation
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
he
have
not
set
about
one
function
in
particular
with
zeal
and
steadiness
.
<EOS>
not
an
admirable
experience
,
to
be
propose
as
an
ideal
;
but
a
form
of
struggle
before
break
of
day
which
some
young
man
since
the
patriarch
have
have
to
pass
through
,
with
more
or
less
of
bruise
if
not
lame
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
say
that
under
his
calm
exterior
he
have
a
fervor
which
make
him
easily
feel
the
presence
of
poetry
in
everyday
event
;
and
the
form
of
the
Juden
-
gasse
,
rouse
the
sense
of
union
with
what
be
remote
,
set
him
muse

element
of
our
historic
life
which
that
sense
raise
into
the
same
region
of
poetry
;
 
the
faint
beginning
of
faith
and
institution
,
and
their
obscure
lingering
decay
;
the
dust
and
withered
remnant
with
which
they
be
apt
to
be
cover
,
only
enhance
for
the
awakened
perception
the
impressiveness
either
of
a
sublimely
penetrate
life
,
as
in
the
twin
green
leave
that
will
become
the
shelter
tree
,
or
of
a
pathetic
inheritance
in
which
all
the
grandeur
and
the
glory
have
become
a
sorrow
memory

<EOS>
this
imaginative
stirring
,
as
he
turn
out
of
the
Juden
-
gasse
,
and
continue
to
saunter
in
the
warm
evening
air
,
mean
to
find
his
way
to
the
synagogue
,
neutralize
the
repellent
effect
of
certain
ugly
little
incident
on
his
way
.
<EOS>
turn
into
an
old
book
-
shop
to
ask
the
exact
time
of
service
at
the
synagogue
,
he
be
affectionately
direct
by
a
precocious
jewish
youth
,
who
enter
cordially
into
his
wanting
,
not
the
fine
new
building
of
the
Reformed
but
the
old
Rabbinical
school
of
the
orthodox
;
and
then
cheat
him
like
a
pure
Teuton
,
only
with
more
amenity
,
in
his
charge
for
a
book
quite
out
of
request
as
one
"
nicht
<EOS>
so
leicht
zu
bekommen
.
<EOS>
"
meanwhile
at
the
opposite
counter
a
deaf
and
grisly
tradesman
be
cast
a
flinty
look
at
certain
card
,
apparently
combine
advantage
of
business
with
religion
,
and
shoutingly
propose
to
him
in
Jew
-
dialect
by
a
dingy
man
in
a
tall
coat
hang
from
neck
to
heel
,
a
bag
in
hand
,
and
a
broad
low
hat
surmount
his
choose
nose
 
who
have
no
sooner
disappear
than
another
dingy
man
of
the
same
pattern
issue
from
the
background
gloom
of
the
shop
and
also
shout
in
the
same
dialect
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
Deronda
see
various
queer
-
look
Israelites
not
altogether
without
guile
,
and
just
distinguishable
from
queer
-
look
Christians
of
the
same
mixed
_
morale
_
.
<EOS>
in
his
anxiety
about
Mirah
's
relative
,
he
have
lately
be
think
of
vulgar
Jews
with
a
sort
of
personal
alarm
.
<EOS>
but
a
little
comparison
will
often
diminish
our
surprise
and
disgust
at
the
aberration
of
Jews
and
other
dissident
whose
life
do
not
offer
a
consistent
or
lovely
pattern
of
their
creed
;
and
<EOS>
this
evening
Deronda
,
become
more
conscious
that
he
be
fall
into
unfairness
and
ridiculous
exaggeration
,
begin
to
use
that
corrective
comparison
:
he
pay
his
thaler
too
much
,
without
prejudice
to
his
interest
in
the
hebrew
destiny
,
or
his
wish
to
find
the
_
Rabbinische
Schule
_
,
which
he
arrive
at
by
sunset
,
and
enter
with
a
good
congregation
of
man
.
  
<EOS>
He
happen
to
take
his
seat
in
a
line
with
an
elderly
man
from
whom
he
be
distant
enough
to
glance
at
him
more
than
once
as
rather
a
noticeable
figure
 
<EOS>
his
ample
white
beard
and
feel
hat
frame
a
profile
of
that
fine
contour
which
may
as
easily
be
italian
as
Hebrew
.
<EOS>
He
return
Deronda
's
notice
till
at
last
their
eye
meet
;
an
undesirable
chance
with
unknown
person
,
and
a
reason
to
Deronda
for
not
look
again
;
but
he
immediately
find
an
open
prayer
-
book
push
toward
him
and
have
to
bow
his
thank
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
congregation
have
muster
,
the
reader
have
mount
to
the
_
almemor
_
or
platform
,
and
the
service
begin
.
<EOS>
Deronda
,
have
look
enough
at
the
german
translation
of
the
Hebrew
in
the
book
before
him
to
know
that
he
be
chiefly
hear
Psalms
and
Old
Testament
passage
or
phrase
,
give
himself
up
to
that
strong
effect
of
chant
liturgy
which
be
independent
of
detailed
verbal
meaning
 
like
the
effect
of
an
Allegri
's
_
Miserere
_
or
a
Palestrina
's
_
Magnificat
_
.
<EOS>
the
most
powerful
movement
of
feel
with
a
liturgy
be
the
prayer
which
seek
for
nothing
special
,
but
be
a
yearning
to
escape
from
the
limitation
of
our
own
weakness
and
an
invocation
of
all
good
to
enter
and
abide
with
us
;
or
else
a
self
-
oblivious
lifting
up
of
Gladness
,
a
_
Gloria
in
excelsis
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
that
such
good
exist
;
both
the
yearning
and
the
exaltation
gather
their
utmost
force
from
the
sense
of
communion
in
a
form
which
have
express
them
both
,
for
long
generation
of
struggle
fellow
-
man
.
<EOS>
the
Hebrew
liturgy
,
like
other
,
have
its
transition
of
litany
,
lyric
,
proclamation
,
dry
statement
and
blessing
;
but
this
evening
,
all
be
one
for
Deronda
:
the
chant
of
the
_
Chazaris
_
or
Reader
's
grand
wide
-
range
voice
with
its
passage
from
monotony
to
sudden
cry
,
the
outburst
of
sweet
boy
'
voice
from
the
little
choir
,
the
devotional
swaying
of
man
's
body
backward
and
forward
,
the
very
commonness
of
the
building
and
shabbiness
of
the
scene
where
a
national
faith
,
which
have
penetrate
the
thinking
of
half
the
world
,
and
mould
the
splendid
form
of
that
world
's
religion
,
be
find
a
remote
,
obscure
echo
 
all
be
blent
for
him
as
one
expression
of
a
bind
history
,
tragic
and
yet
glorious
.
<EOS>
He
wonder
at
the
strength
of
his
own
feeling
;
it
seem
beyond
the
occasion
 
what
one
may
imagine
to
be
a
divine
influx
in
the
darkness
,
before
there
be
any
vision
to
interpret
.
<EOS>
the
whole
scene
be
a
coherent
strain
,
its
burden
a
passionate
regret
,
which
,
if
he
have
know
the
liturgy
for
the
Day
of
Reconciliation
,
he
may
have
clothe
in
its
authentic
burden
;
"
Happy
the
eye
which
see
all
these
thing
;
but
verily
to
hear
only
of
them
afflict
our
soul
.
<EOS>
happy
the
eye
that
see
our
temple
and
the
joy
of
our
congregation
;
but
verily
to
hear
only
of
them
afflict
our
soul
.
<EOS>
happy
the
eye
that
see
the
finger
when
tune
every
kind
of
song
;
but
verily
to
hear
only
of
them
afflict
our
soul
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
with
the
cessation
of
the
devotional
sound
and
the
movement
of
many
indifferent
face
and
vulgar
figure
before
him
there
dart
into
his
mind
the
frigid
idea
that
he
have
probably
be
alone
in
his
feeling
,
and
perhaps
the
only
person
in
the
congregation
for
whom
the
service
be
more
than
a
dull
routine
.
<EOS>
there
be
just
time
for
this
chill
thought
<EOS>
before
he
have
bow
to
his
civil
neighbor
and
be
move
away
with
the
rest
 
when
he
feel
a
hand
on
his
arm
,
and
turn
with
the
rather
unpleasant
sensation
which
this
abrupt
sort
of
claim
be
apt
to
bring
,
he
see
close
to
him
the
white
-
bearded
face
of
that
neighbor
,
who
say
to
him
in
German
,
"
excuse
me
<EOS>
,
young
gentleman
 
allow
me
 
<EOS>
what
be
your
parentage
 
<EOS>
your
mother
's
family
 
her
maiden
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
have
a
strongly
resistant
feeling
:
he
be
inclined
to
shake
off
hastily
the
touch
on
his
arm
;
but
he
manage
to
slip
it
away
and
say
coldly
,
"
I
be
an
Englishman
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
questioner
look
at
him
dubiously
still
for
an
instant
,
then
just
lift
his
hat
and
turn
away
;
whether
under
a
sense
of
have
make
a
mistake
or
of
have
be
repulse
,
Deronda
be
uncertain
.
<EOS>
in
his
walk
back
to
the
hotel
he
try
to
still
any
uneasiness
on
the
subject
by
reflect
that
he
could
not
have
act
differently
.
<EOS>
how
could
he
say
that
he
do
not
know
the
name
of
his
mother
's
family
to
that
total
stranger
?
 
<EOS>
who
indeed
have
take
an
unwarrantable
liberty
in
the
abruptness
of
his
question
,
dictate
probably
by
some
fancy
of
likeness
such
as
often
occur
without
real
significance
.
<EOS>
the
incident
,
he
say
to
himself
,
be
trivial
;
but
whatever
import
it
may
have
,
his
inward
shrink
on
the
occasion
be
too
strong
for
him
to
be
sorry
that
he
have
cut
it
short
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
reason
,
however
,
for
his
not
mention
the
synagogue
to
the
Mallingers
 
in
addition
to
his
usual
inclination
to
reticence
on
anything
that
the
baronet
would
have
be
likely
to
call
quixotic
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
hardly
any
man
could
be
more
good
-
natured
than
Sir
Hugo
;
indeed
in
his
kindliness
especially
to
woman
,
he
do
action
which
other
would
have
call
romantic
;
but
he
never
take
a
romantic
view
of
them
,
and
in
general
smile
at
the
introduction
of
motive
on
a
grand
scale
,
or
of
reason
that
lie
very
far
off
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
point
of
strong
difference
between
him
and
Deronda
,
who
rarely
eat
at
breakfast
without
some
silent
discursive
flight
after
ground
for
fill
up
his
day
accord
to
the
practice
of
his
contemporary
.
  
<EOS>
this
halt
at
Frankfort
be
take
on
their
way
home
,
and
its
impression
be
keep
the
more
actively
vibrate
in
him
by
the
duty
of
care
for
Mirah
's
welfare
.
<EOS>
that
question
about
his
parentage
,
which
if
he
have
not
both
inwardly
and
outwardly
shake
it
off
as
trivial
,
would
have
seem
a
threat
rather
than
a
promise
of
revelation
,
and
reinforce
his
anxiety
as
to
the
effect
of
find
Mirah
's
relative
and
his
resolve
to
proceed
with
caution
.
<EOS>
if
he
make
any
unpleasant
discovery
,
be
he
bind
to
a
disclosure
that
may
cast
a
new
net
of
trouble
around
her
?
<EOS>
He
have
write
to
Mrs.
Meyrick
to
announce
his
visit
at
four
o'clock
,
and
he
find
Mirah
seat
at
work
with
only
Mrs.
Meyrick
and
Mab
,
the
open
piano
,
and
all
the
glorious
company
of
engraving
.
<EOS>
the
dainty
neatness
of
her
hair
and
dress
,
the
glow
of
tranquil
happiness
in
a
face
where
a
painter
need
have
change
nothing
if
he
have
want
to
put
it
in
front
of
the
host
singe
"
peace
on
earth
and
good
will
to
man
,
"
make
a
contrast
to
his
first
vision
of
her
that
be
delightful
to
Deronda
's
eye
.
<EOS>
Mirah
herself
be
think
of
it
,
and
immediately
on
their
greeting
say
    
"
see
how
different
I
be
from
the
miserable
creature
by
the
river
!
<EOS>
all
because
you
find
me
and
bring
me
to
the
very
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
good
chance
to
find
you
,
"
say
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
any
other
man
would
have
be
glad
to
do
what
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
not
the
right
way
to
be
think
about
it
,
"
say
Mirah
,
shake
her
head
with
decisive
gravity
,
"
I
think
of
what
really
be
.
<EOS>
It
be
you
,
and
not
another
,
who
find
me
and
be
good
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
agree
with
Mirah
,
"
say
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Saint
Anybody
be
a
bad
saint
to
pray
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
besides
,
anybody
could
not
have
bring
me
to
you
,
"
say
Mirah
,
smile
at
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
"
and
I
would
rather
be
with
you
than
with
any
one
else
in
the
world
except
my
mother
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
ever
a
poor
little
bird
,
that
be
lose
and
could
not
fly
,
be
take
and
put
into
a
warm
nest
where
be
a
mother
and
sister
who
take
to
it
so
that
everything
come
naturally
,
as
if
it
have
be
always
there
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
think
before
that
the
world
could
ever
be
as
happy
and
without
fear
as
it
be
to
me
now
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
look
meditative
a
moment
,
and
then
say
,
"
sometimes
I
be
<EOS>
a
_
little
_
afraid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
you
be
afraid
of
?
"
say
Deronda
with
anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
when
I
be
turn
at
the
corner
of
a
street
I
may
meet
my
father
.
<EOS>
It
seem
dreadful
that
I
should
be
afraid
of
meet
him
.
<EOS>
that
be
my
only
sorrow
,
"
say
Mirah
,
plaintively
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
surely
not
very
probable
,
"
say
Deronda
,
wish
that
it
be
less
so
<EOS>
;
then
,
not
to
let
the
opportunity
escape
 
<EOS>
"
Would
it
be
a
great
grief
to
you
now
if
you
be
never
to
meet
your
mother
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
do
not
answer
immediately
,
but
meditate
again
,
with
her
eye
fix
on
the
opposite
wall
.
<EOS>
then
she
turn
them
on
Deronda
and
say
firmly
,
as
if
she
have
arrive
at
the
exact
truth
,
"
I
want
her
to
know
that
I
have
always
love
her
,
and
if
she
be
alive
I
want
to
comfort
her
.
<EOS>
She
may
be
dead
.
<EOS>
if
she
be
<EOS>
I
should
long
to
know
where
she
be
bury
;
and
to
know
whether
my
brother
live
,
so
that
we
can
remember
her
together
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
try
not
to
grieve
.
<EOS>
I
have
think
much
for
so
many
year
of
her
be
dead
.
<EOS>
and
I
shall
have
her
with
me
in
my
mind
,
as
I
have
always
have
.
<EOS>
We
can
never
be
really
part
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
never
sin
against
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
try
not
to
do
what
would
hurt
her
.
<EOS>
only
,
she
may
be
sorry
that
I
be
not
a
good
Jewess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
what
way
be
you
not
a
good
Jewess
?
"
say
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
ignorant
,
and
we
never
observe
the
law
,
but
live
among
Christians
just
as
they
do
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
hear
my
father
laugh
at
the
strictness
of
the
Jews
about
their
food
and
all
custom
,
and
their
not
like
Christians
.
<EOS>
I
think
my
mother
be
strict
;
but
she
could
never
want
me
not
to
like
those
who
be
well
to
me
than
any
of
my
own
people
I
have
ever
know
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
could
obey
in
other
thing
that
she
wish
but
not
in
that
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
much
easy
to
me
to
share
in
love
than
in
hatred
.
<EOS>
I
remember
a
play
I
read
in
german
 
since
I
have
be
here
<EOS>
it
have
come
into
my
mind
 
where
the
heroine
say
something
like
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Antigone
,
"
say
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
you
know
it
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
believe
that
my
mother
would
wish
me
not
to
love
my
good
friend
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
grateful
to
them

here
Mirah
have
turn
to
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
and
with
a
sudden
lighting
up
of
her
whole
countenance
,
she
say
,
"
oh
,
if
we
ever
do
meet
and
know
each
other
as
we
be
now
,
so
that
I
could
tell
what
would
comfort
her
 
I
should
be
so
full
of
blessedness
<EOS>
my
soul
would
know
no
want
but
to
love
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
child
!
"
say
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
the
word
escape
involuntarily
from
her
motherly
heart
.
<EOS>
but
to
relieve
the
strain
of
feeling
she
look
at
Deronda
and
say
,
"
It
be
curious
that
Mirah
,
who
remember
her
mother
<EOS>
so
well
it
be
as
if
she
see
her
,
can
not
recall
her
brother
the
least
bit
 
except
the
feeling
of
have
be
carry
by
him
when
she
be
tired
,
and
of
his
being
near
her
when
she
be
in
her
mother
's
lap
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
that
he
be
rarely
at
home
.
<EOS>
He
be
already
grow
up
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
her
brother
should
be
quite
a
stranger
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
good
;
I
feel
sure
Ezra
be
good
,
"
say
Mirah
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
love
my
mother
 
he
would
take
care
of
her
.
<EOS>
I
remember
more
of
him
than
that
.
<EOS>
I
remember
my
mother
's
voice
once
call
,
"
Ezra
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
his
answering
from
a
distance
"
Mother
!
"
<EOS>
"
 
Mirah
have
change
her
voice
a
little
in
each
of
these
word
and
have
give
them
a
love
intonation
 
"
and
then
he
come
close
to
us
.
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
he
be
good
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
take
comfort
from
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
answer
this
either
with
agreement
or
doubt
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
and
Deronda
exchange
a
quick
glance
:
about
this
brother
she
feel
as
painfully
dubious
as
he
do
.
<EOS>
but
Mirah
go
on
,
absorb
in
her
memory
    
<EOS>
"
be
it
not
wonderful
how
I
remember
the
voice
better
than
anything
else
?
<EOS>
I
think
they
must
go
deeper
into
us
than
other
thing
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
fancy
heaven
may
be
make
of
voice
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
like
your
singing
 
<EOS>
yes
,
"
say
Mab
,
who
have
hitherto
keep
a
modest
silence
,
and
now
speak
bashfully
,
as
be
her
will
not
in
the
presence
of
Prince
Camaralzaman
 
"
Ma
,
do
ask
Mirah
to
sing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Deronda
have
not
hear
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
it
be
disagreeable
to
you
to
sing
now
?
"
say
Deronda
,
with
a
more
deferential
gentleness
than
he
have
ever
be
conscious
of
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
shall
like
it
,
"
say
Mirah
.
<EOS>
"
My
voice
have
come
back
a
little
with
rest
.
"
  
<EOS>
perhaps
her
ease
of
manner
be
due
to
something
more
than
the
simplicity
of
her
nature
.
<EOS>
the
circumstance
of
her
life
make
her
think
of
everything
she
do
as
work
demand
from
her
,
in
which
affectation
have
nothing
to
do
;
and
she
have
begin
her
work
before
self
-
consciousness
be
bear
.
  
<EOS>
She
immediately
rise
and
go
to
the
piano
 
a
somewhat
wear
instrument
that
seem
to
get
the
well
of
its
infirmity
under
the
firm
touch
of
her
small
finger
as
she
prelude
.
<EOS>
Deronda
place
himself
where
he
could
see
her
while
she
sing
;
and
she
take
everything
as
quietly
as
if
she
have
be
a
child
go
to
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
imagine
her
 
it
be
always
good
to
imagine
a
human
creature
in
whom
bodily
loveliness
seem
as
properly
one
with
the
entire
being
as
the
bodily
loveliness
of
those
wondrous
transparent
orb
of
life
that
we
find
in
the
sea
 
imagine
her
with
her
dark
hair
brush
from
her
temple
,
but
yet
show
certain
tiny
ring
there
which
have
cunningly
find
their
own
way
back
,
the
mass
of
it
hang
behind
just
to
the
nape
of
the
little
neck
in
curly
fibre
,
such
as
renew
themselves
at
their
own
will
after
be
bathe
into
straightness
like
that
of
water
-
grass
.
<EOS>
then
see
the
perfect
cameo
her
profile
make
,
cut
in
a
duskish
shell
,
where
by
some
happy
fortune
there
pierce
a
gem
-
like
darkness
for
the
eye
and
eyebrow
;
the
delicate
nostril
define
enough
to
be
ready
for
sensitive
movement
,
the
finished
ear
,
the
firm
curve
of
the
chin
and
neck
,
enter
into
the
expression
of
a
refinement
which
be
not
feebleness
.
  
<EOS>
She
sing
Beethoven
's
"
per
pietà
non
dirmi
addio
"
with
a
subdued
but
search
pathos
which
have
that
essential
of
perfect
singing
,
the
make
one
oblivious
of
art
or
manner
,
and
only
possess
one
with
the
song
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
sort
of
voice
that
give
the
impression
of
be
mean
like
a
bird
's
wooing
for
an
audience
near
and
beloved
.
<EOS>
Deronda
begin
by
look
at
her
,
but
feel
himself
presently
cover
his
eye
with
his
hand
,
want
to
seclude
the
melody
in
darkness
;
then
he
refrain
from
what
may
seem
oddity
,
and
be
ready
to
meet
the
look
of
mute
appeal
which
she
turn
toward
him
at
the
end
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
never
enjoy
a
song
more
than
that
,
"
he
say
,
gratefully
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
like
my
singing
?
<EOS>
I
be
so
glad
,
"
she
say
,
with
a
smile
of
delight
.
<EOS>
"
It
have
be
a
great
pain
to
me
,
because
it
fail
in
what
it
be
want
for
.
<EOS>
but
now
we
think
I
can
use
it
to
get
my
bread
.
<EOS>
I
have
really
be
teach
well
.
<EOS>
and
now
I
have
two
pupil
,
that
Miss
Meyrick
find
for
me
.
<EOS>
They
pay
me
nearly
two
crown
for
their
two
lesson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
know
some
lady
who
would
find
you
many
pupil
after
Christmas
,
"
say
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
not
mind
singe
before
any
one
who
wish
to
hear
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
no
,
I
want
to
do
something
to
get
money
.
<EOS>
I
could
teach
read
and
speak
,
Mrs.
Meyrick
think
.
<EOS>
but
if
no
one
would
learn
of
me
,
that
be
difficult
.
"
<EOS>
Mirah
smile
with
a
touch
of
merriment
he
have
not
see
in
her
before
.
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
I
should
find
her
poor
 
<EOS>
I
mean
my
mother
.
<EOS>
I
should
want
to
get
money
for
her
.
<EOS>
and
I
can
not
always
live
on
charity
;
though
"
 
here
she
turn
so
as
to
take
all
three
of
her
companion
in
one
glance
 
"
it
be
the
sweetest
charity
in
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
you
can
get
rich
,
"
say
Deronda
,
smile
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
great
lady
will
perhaps
like
you
to
teach
their
daughter
,
We
shall
see
.
<EOS>
but
now
do
sing
again
to
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
go
on
willingly
,
singe
with
ready
memory
various
thing
by
Gordigiani
and
Schubert
;
then
,
when
she
have
leave
the
piano
,
Mab
say
,
entreatingly
,
"
oh
,
Mirah
,
if
you
would
not
mind
singe
the
little
hymn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
too
childish
,
"
say
Mirah
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
like
lisp
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
hymn
?
"
say
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
hebrew
hymn
<EOS>
she
remember
her
mother
singe
over
her
when
she
lie
in
her
cot
,
"
say
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
very
much
to
hear
it
,
"
say
Deronda
,
"
if
you
think
I
be
worthy
to
hear
what
be
so
sacred
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
sing
it
if
you
like
,
"
say
Mirah
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
sing
real
word
 
only
here
and
there
a
syllable
like
her
 
<EOS>
the
rest
be
lisp
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
Hebrew
?
<EOS>
because
if
you
do
,
my
singing
will
seem
childish
nonsense
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
shake
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
quite
good
Hebrew
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
cross
her
little
foot
and
hand
in
her
easy
attitude
,
and
then
lift
up
her
head
at
an
angle
which
seem
to
be
direct
to
some
invisible
face
bent
over
her
,
while
she
sing
a
little
hymn
of
quaint
melancholy
interval
,
with
syllable
that
really
seem
childish
lisp
to
her
audience
;
the
voice
in
which
she
give
it
forth
have
gather
even
a
sweet
,
more
cooing
tenderness
than
be
hear
in
her
other
song
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
be
ever
to
know
the
real
word
,
I
should
still
go
on
in
my
old
way
with
them
,
"
say
Mirah
,
when
she
have
repeat
the
hymn
several
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
not
?
"
say
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
the
lisp
syllable
be
very
full
of
meaning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
indeed
,
"
say
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
mother
hear
something
of
a
lisp
in
her
child
's
talk
to
the
very
last
.
<EOS>
Their
word
be
not
just
what
everybody
else
say
,
though
they
may
be
spell
the
same
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
to
live
till
my
Hans
get
old
,
I
should
still
see
the
boy
in
him
.
<EOS>
a
mother
's
love
,
I
often
say
,
be
like
a
tree
that
have
get
all
the
wood
in
it
,
from
the
very
first
it
make
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
not
that
the
way
with
friendship
,
too
?
"
say
Deronda
,
smile
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
not
let
the
mother
be
too
arrogant
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
little
woman
shake
her
head
over
her
darning
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
easy
to
find
an
old
mother
than
an
old
friend
.
<EOS>
friendship
begin
with
liking
or
gratitude
 
root
that
can
be
pull
up
.
<EOS>
Mother
's
love
begin
deep
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
like
what
you
be
say
about
the
influence
of
voice
,
"
say
Deronda
,
look
at
Mirah
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
your
hymn
would
have
have
more
expression
for
me
if
I
have
know
the
word
.
<EOS>
I
go
to
the
synagogue
at
Frankfort
before
I
come
home
,
and
the
service
impress
me
just
as
much
as
if
I
have
follow
the
word
 
perhaps
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
be
it
great
to
you
?
<EOS>
do
it
go
to
your
heart
?
"
<EOS>
say
Mirah
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
none
but
our
people
would
feel
that
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
all
shut
away
like
a
river
in
a
deep
valley
,
where
only
heaven
see
 
I
mean
   
<EOS>
"
she
hesitate
feeling
that
she
could
not
disentangle
her
thought
from
its
imagery
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
,
"
say
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
but
there
be
not
really
such
a
separation
 
deeper
down
,
as
Mrs.
Meyrick
say
.
<EOS>
Our
religion
be
chiefly
a
hebrew
religion
;
and
since
Jews
be
man
,
their
religious
feeling
must
have
much
in
common
with
those
of
other
man
 
just
as
their
poetry
,
though
in
one
sense
peculiar
,
have
a
great
deal
in
common
with
the
poetry
of
other
nation
.
<EOS>
still
it
be
to
be
expect
that
a
Jew
would
feel
the
form
of
his
people
's
religion
more
than
one
of
another
race
 
and
yet
"
 
here
Deronda
hesitate
in
his
turn
 
"
that
be
perhaps
not
always
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
no
,
"
say
Mirah
,
sadly
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
see
that
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
them
mock
.
<EOS>
be
it
not
like
mock
your
parent
?
 
<EOS>
like
rejoice
in
your
parent
'
shame
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
some
mind
naturally
rebel
against
whatever
they
be
bring
up
in
,
and
like
the
opposite
;
they
see
the
fault
in
what
be
near
to
them
,
"
say
Deronda
apologetically
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
be
not
like
that
,
"
say
Mirah
,
look
at
him
with
unconscious
fixedness
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
think
not
,
"
say
Deronda
;
"
<EOS>
but
you
know
I
be
not
bring
up
as
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
I
be
always
forget
,
"
say
Mirah
,
with
a
look
of
disappointed
recollection
,
and
slightly
blush
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
also
feel
rather
embarrassed
,
and
there
be
an
awkward
pause
,
which
he
put
an
end
to
by
say
playfully
    
"
whichever
way
we
take
it
,
we
have
to
tolerate
each
other
;
for
if
we
all
go
in
opposition
to
our
teaching
,
we
must
end
in
difference
,
just
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
We
should
go
on
forever
in
zig
-
zags
,
"
say
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
very
weak
-
minded
to
make
your
creed
up
by
the
rule
of
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
still
one
may
honor
one
's
parent
,
without
follow
their
notion
exactly
,
any
more
than
the
exact
cut
of
their
clothing
.
<EOS>
My
father
be
a
Scotch
Calvinist
and
my
mother
be
a
French
Calvinist
;
I
be
neither
quite
Scotch
,
nor
quite
french
,
nor
two
calvinist
roll
into
one
,
yet
I
honor
my
parent
'
memory

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"

I
could
not
make
myself
not
a
Jewess

"
say
Mirah

insistently
,
"
even
if
I
change
my
belief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
but
if
Jews
and
Jewesses
go
on
change
their
religion
,
and
make
no
difference
between
themselves
and
Christians
,
there
would
come
a
time
when
there
would
be
no
Jews
to
be
see
,
"
say
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
take
that
consummation
very
cheerfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
please
not
to
say
that
,
"
say
Mirah
,
the
tear
gather
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
first
unkind
thing
you
ever
say
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
begin
that
.
<EOS>
I
will
never
separate
myself
from
my
mother

I
be
force
to
fly
from

to

Mirah

she

to

to
discover
in

all
the
keener
in
him
because
of
a
suppress
consciousness
that
a
not
unlike
possibility
of
collision
may
lie
hide
in
his
own
lot
.
<EOS>
not
that
he
would
have
look
with
more
complacency
of
expectation
at
wealthy
Jews
,
outdo
the
lord
of
the
Philistines
in
their
sport
;
but
since
there
be
no
likelihood
of
Mirah
's
friend
be
find
among
that
class
,
their
habit
do
not
immediately
affect
him
.
<EOS>
in
this
mood
he
ramble
,
without
expectation
of
a
more
pregnant
result
than
a
little
preparation
of
his
own
mind
,
perhaps
for
future
theorizing
as
well
as
practice
 
very
much
as
if
,
Mirah
be
relate
to
Welsh
miner
,
he
have
go
to
look
more
closely
at
the
way
of
those
people
,
not
without
wish
at
the
same
time
to
get
a
little
light
of
detail
on
the
history
of
strike
.
  
<EOS>
He
really
do
not
long
to
find
anybody
in
particular
;
and
when
,
as
his
habit
be
,
he
look
at
the
name
over
a
shop
door
,
he
be
well
content
that
it
be
not
Ezra
Cohen
.
<EOS>
I
confess
,
he
particularly
desire
that
Ezra
Cohen
should
not
keep
a
shop
.
<EOS>
wish
be
hold
to
be
ominous
;
accord
to
which
belief
the
order
of
the
world
be
so
arrange
that
if
you
have
an
impious
objection
to
a
squint
,
your
offspring
be
the
more
likely
to
be
bear
with
one
;
also
,
that
if
you
happen
to
desire
a
squint
you
would
not
get
it
.
<EOS>
this
desponding
view
of
probability
the
hopeful
entirely
reject
,
take
their
wish
as
good
and
sufficient
security
for
all
kind
of
fulfilment
.
<EOS>
who
be
absolutely
neutral
?
<EOS>
Deronda
happen
one
morning
to
turn
into
a
little
side
street
out
of
the
noise
and
obstruction
of
Holborn
,
feel
the
scale
dip
on
the
desponding
side
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
rather
tired
of
the
street
and
have
pause
to
hail
a
hansom
cab
which
he
see
come
,
when
his
attention
be
catch
by
some
fine
old
clasp
in
chase
silver
display
in
the
window
at
his
right
hand
.
<EOS>
His
first
thought
be
that
Lady
Mallinger
,
who
have
a
strictly
protestant
taste
for
such
catholic
spoil
,
may
like
to
have
these
missal
-
clasp
turn
into
a
bracelet
:
then
his
eye
travel
over
the
other
content
of
the
window
,
and
he
see
that
the
shop
be
that
kind
of
pawnbroker
's
where
the
lead
be
give
to
jewelry
,
lace
and
all
equivocal
object
introduce
as
_
bric
-
à
-
brac
_
.
<EOS>
a
placard
in
one
corner
announce
 
<EOS>
_
Watches
and
Jewelry
exchange
and
repair
_
.
<EOS>
but
his
survey
have
be
notice
from
within
,
and
a
figure
appear
at
the
door
,
look
round
at
him
and
say
in
a
tone
of
cordial
encouragement
,
"
good
day
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
instant
be
enough
for
Deronda
to
see
the
face
,
unmistakably
jewish
,
belong
to
a
young
man
about
thirty
,
and
wince
from
the
shopkeeper
's
persuasiveness
that
would
probably
follow
,
he
have
no
sooner
return
the
"
good
day
,
"
than
he
pass
to
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
beckon
to
the
cabman
to
draw
up
there
.
<EOS>
from
that
station
he
see
the
name
over
the
shop
window
 
Ezra
Cohen
.
  
<EOS>
there
may
be
a
hundred
Ezra
Cohens
letter
above
shop
window
,
but
Deronda
have
not
see
them
.
<EOS>
probably
the
young
man
interested
in
a
possible
customer
be
Ezra
himself
;
and
he
be
about
the
age
to
be
expect
in
Mirah
's
brother
,
who
be
grow
up
while
she
be
still
a
little
child
.
<EOS>
but
Deronda
's
first
endeavor
as
he
drive
homeward
be
to
convince
himself
that
there
be
not
the
slight
warrantable
presumption
of
this
Ezra
be
Mirah
's
brother
;
and
next
,
that
even
if
,
in
spite
of
good
reasoning
,
he
turn
out
to
be
that
brother
,
while
on
inquiry
the
mother
be
find
to
be
dead
,
it
be
not
his
 
Deronda
's
 
duty
to
make
known
the
discovery
to
Mirah
.
<EOS>
in
inconvenient
disturbance
of
this
conclusion
there
come
his
lately
-
acquire
knowledge
that
Mirah
would
have
a
religious
desire
to
know
of
her
mother
's
death
,
and
also
to
learn
whether
her
brother
be
live
.
<EOS>
how
far
be
he
justify
in
determine
another
life
by
his
own
notion
?
<EOS>
be
it
not
his
secret
complaint
against
the
way
in
which
other
have
order
his
own
life
,
that
he
have
not
open
daylight
on
all
its
relation
,
so
that
he
have
not
,
like
other
man
,
the
full
guidance
of
primary
duty
?
  
<EOS>
the
immediate
relief
from
this
inward
debate
be
the
reflection
that
he
have
not
yet
make
any
real
discovery
,
and
that
by
look
into
the
fact
more
closely
he
should
be
certify
that
there
be
no
demand
on
him
for
any
decision
<EOS>
whatever
.
<EOS>
He
intend
to
return
to
that
shop
as
soon
as
he
could
conveniently
,
and
buy
the
clasp
for
Lady
Mallinger
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
hinder
for
several
day
by
Sir
Hugo
,
who
,
about
to
make
an
after
-
dinner
speech
on
a
burn
topic
,
want
Deronda
to
forage
for
him
on
the
legal
part
of
the
question
,
besides
waste
time
every
day
on
argument
which
always
end
in
a
draw
battle
.
<EOS>
as
on
many
other
question
,
they
hold
different
side
,
but
Sir
Hugo
do
not
mind
this
,
and
when
Deronda
put
his
point
well
,
say
,
with
a
mixture
of
satisfaction
and
regret
    
"
confound
it
,
Dan
!
<EOS>
why
do
not
you
make
an
opportunity
of
say
these
thing
in
public
?
<EOS>
You
be
wrong
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
succeed
.
<EOS>
You
have
get
the
massive
sentiment
 
<EOS>
the
heavy
artillery
of
the
country
against
you
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
all
the
well
ground
for
a
young
man
to
display
himself
on
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
your
age
,
I
should
have
take
it
.
<EOS>
and
it
would
be
quite
as
well
for
you
to
be
in
opposition
to
me
here
and
there
.
<EOS>
It
would
throw
you
more
into
relief
.
<EOS>
if
you
would
seize
an
occasion
of
this
sort
to
make
an
impression
,
you
may
be
in
Parliament
in
no
time
.
<EOS>
and
you
know
that
would
gratify
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
not
to
do
what
would
gratify
you
,
sir
,
"
say
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
can
not
persuade
myself
to
look
at
politic
as
a
profession
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
not
?
<EOS>
if
a
man
be
not
bear
into
public
life
by
his
position
in
the
country
,
there
be
no
way
for
him
but
to
embrace
it
by
his
own
effort
.
<EOS>
the
business
of
the
country
must
be
do
 
her
Majesty
's
Government
carry
on
,
as
the
old
Duke
say
.
<EOS>
and
it
never
could
be
,
<EOS>
my
boy
,
if
everybody
look
at
politic
as
if
they
be
prophecy
,
and
demand
an
inspired
vocation
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
to
get
into
Parliament
,
it
will
not
do
to
sit
still
and
wait
for
a
call
either
from
heaven
or
constituent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
to
make
a
living
out
of
opinion
,
"
say
Deronda
;
"
especially
out
of
borrow
opinion
.
<EOS>
not
that
I
mean
to
blame
other
man
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
<EOS>
many
well
fellow
than
I
do
not
mind
get
on
to
a
platform
to
praise
themselves
,
and
give
their
word
of
honor
for
a
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
,
Dan
,
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
"
a
man
who
set
his
face
against
every
sort
of
humbug
be
simply
a
three
-
cornered
,
impracticable
fellow
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
bad
style
of
humbug
,
but
there
be
also
a
good
style
 
one
that
oil
the
wheel
and
make
progress
possible
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
to
rule
man
,
you
must
rule
them
through
their
own
idea
;
and
I
agree
with
the
Archbishop
at
Naples
who
have
a
St.
Januarius
procession
against
the
plague
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
use
have
an
order
in
Council
against
popular
shallowness
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
action
possible
without
a
little
acting
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
one
may
be
oblige
to
give
way
to
an
occasional
necessity
,
"
say
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
one
thing
to
say
,
"
in
this
particular
case
I
be
force
to
put
on
this
foolscap
and
grin
,
"
and
another
to
buy
a
pocket
foolscap
and
practice
myself
in
grin
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
see
any
real
public
expediency
that
do
not
keep
an
ideal
before
it
which
make
a
limit
of
deviation
from
the
direct
path
.
<EOS>
but
if
I
be
to
set
up
for
a
public
man
I
may
mistake
my
success
for
public
expediency
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
after
this
dialogue
,
which
be
rather
jar
to
him
,
that
Deronda
set
out
on
his
meditate
second
visit
to
Ezra
Cohen
's
.
<EOS>
He
enter
the
street
at
the
end
opposite
to
the
Holborn
entrance
,
and
an
inward
reluctance
slacken
his
pace
while
his
thought
be
transfer
what
he
have
just
be
say
about
public
expediency
to
the
entirely
private
difficulty
which
bring
him
back
again
into
this
unattractive
thoroughfare
.
<EOS>
It
may
soon
become
an
immediate
practical
question
with
him
how
far
he
could
call
it
a
wise
expediency
to
conceal
the
fact
of
close
kindre
.
<EOS>
such
question
turn
up
constantly
in
life
be
often
decide
in
a
rough
-
and
-
ready
way
;
and
to
many
it
will
appear
an
over
-
refinement
in
Deronda
that
he
should
make
any
great
point
of
a
matter
confine
to
his
own
knowledge
.
<EOS>
but
we
have
see
the
reason
why
he
have
come
to
regard
concealment
as
a
bane
of
life
,
and
the
necessity
of
concealment
as
a
mark
by
which
line
of
action
be
to
be
avoid
.
<EOS>
the
prospect
of
be
urge
against
the
confirmed
habit
of
his
mind
be
naturally
grate
.
<EOS>
He
even
pause
here
<EOS>
and
there
before
the
most
plausible
shop
-
window
for
a
gentleman
to
look
into
,
half
inclined
to
decide
that
he
would
not
increase
his
knowledge
about
that
modern
Ezra
,
who
be
certainly
not
a
leader
among
his
people
 
<EOS>
a
hesitation
which
prove
how
,
in
a
man
much
give
to
reasoning
,
a
bare
possibility
may
weigh
more
than
the
best
-
clothe
likelihood
;
for
Deronda
's
reasoning
have
decide
that
all
likelihood
be
against
this
man
's
be
Mirah
's
brother
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
the
shop
-
window
he
pause
before
be
that
of
a
second
-
hand
book
-
shop
,
where
,
on
a
narrow
table
outside
,
the
literature
of
the
age
be
represent
in
judicious
mixture
,
from
the
immortal
verse
of
Homer
to
the
mortal
prose
of
the
railway
novel
.
<EOS>
that
the
mixture
be
judicious
be
apparent
from
Deronda
's
finding
in
it
something
that
he
want
 
namely
,
that
wonderful
bit
of
autobiography
,
the
life
of
the
Polish
Jew
,
Salomon
Maimon
;
which
,
as
he
could
easily
slip
it
into
his
pocket
,
he
take
from
its
place
,
and
enter
the
shop
to
pay
for
,
expect
to
see
behind
the
counter
a
grimy
personage
show
that
_
nonchalance
_
about
sale
which
seem
to
belong
universally
to
the
second
-
hand
book
-
business
.
<EOS>
in
most
other
trade
you
find
generous
man
who
be
anxious
to
sell
you
their
ware
for
your
own
welfare
;
but
even
a
Jew
will
not
urge
Simson
's
Euclid
on
you
with
an
affectionate
assurance
that
you
will
have
pleasure
in
read
it
,
and
that
he
wish
he
have
twenty
more
of
the
article
,
so
much
be
it
in
request
.
<EOS>
one
be
lead
to
fear
that
a
secondhand
bookseller
may
belong
to
that
unhappy
class
of
man
who
have
no
belief
in
the
good
of
what
they
get
their
living
by
,
yet
keep
conscience
enough
to
be
morose
rather
than
unctuous
in
their
vocation
.
  
<EOS>
but
instead
of
the
ordinary
tradesman
,
he
see
,
on
the
dark
background
of
book
in
the
long
narrow
shop
,
a
figure
that
be
somewhat
startling
in
its
unusualness
.
<EOS>
a
man
in
threadbare
clothing
,
whose
age
be
difficult
to
guess
 
from
the
dead
yellowish
flatness
of
the
flesh
,
something
like
an
old
ivory
carving
 
be
seat
on
a
stool
against
some
bookshelf
that
project
beyond
the
short
counter
,
do
nothing
more
remarkable
than
read
yesterday
's
_
Times
_
;
but
when
he
let
the
paper
rest
on
his
lap
and
look
at
the
incoming
customer
,
the
thought
glance
through
Deronda
that
precisely
such
a
physiognomy
as
that
may
possibly
have
be
see
in
a
prophet
of
the
Exile
,
or
in
some
New
hebrew
poet
of
the
mediæval
time
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
fine
typical
jewish
face
,
work
into
intensity
of
expression
apparently
by
a
strenuous
eager
experience
in
which
all
the
satisfaction
have
be
indirect
and
far
off
,
and
perhaps
by
some
bodily
suffering
also
,
which
involve
that
absence
of
ease
in
the
present
.
<EOS>
the
feature
be
clear
-
cut
,
not
large
;
the
brow
not
high
but
broad
,
and
fully
define
by
the
crisp
black
hair
.
<EOS>
It
may
never
have
be
a
particularly
handsome
face
,
but
it
must
always
have
be
forcible
;
and
now
with
its
dark
,
far
-
off
gaze
,
and
yellow
pallor
in
relief
on
the
gloom
of
the
backward
shop
,
one
may
have
imagine
one
's
self
come
upon
it
in
some
past
prison
of
the
Inquisition
,
which
a
mob
have
suddenly
burst
upon
;
while
the
look
fix
on
an
incidental
customer
seem
eager
and
question
enough
to
have
be
turn
on
one
who
may
have
be
a
messenger
either
of
delivery
or
of
death
.
<EOS>
the
figure
be
probably
familiar
and
unexcite
enough
to
the
inhabitant
of
this
street
;
but
to
Deronda
's
mind
it
bring
so
strange
a
blending
of
the
unwonted
with
the
common
,
that
there
be
a
perceptible
interval
of
mutual
observation
before
he
ask
his
question
;
"
what
be
the
price
of
this
book
?
"
  
<EOS>
after
take
the
book
and
examine
the
fly
-
leave
without
rise
,
the
suppose
bookseller
say
,
"
there
be
no
mark
,
and
Mr.
Ram
be
not
in
now
.
<EOS>
I
be
keep
the
shop
while
he
be
go
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
what
be
you
disposed
to
give
for
it
?
"
<EOS>
He
hold
the
book
close
on
his
lap
with
his
hand
on
it
and
look
examiningly
at
Deronda
,
over
whom
there
come
the
disagreeable
idea

possibly
this
striking
personage
want
to
see
how
much
could
be
get
out
of
a
customer
's
ignorance
of
price

<EOS>
but
without
further
reflection
he
say
,
"
do
not
you
know
how
much
it
be
worth

<EOS>

not
its

May
I
ask
have
you

no

I
have
read
an
account
of
it

which

to
buy
it

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
man
of
learning
 
<EOS>
you
be
interested
in
jewish
history
?
<EOS>
"
this
be
say
in
a
deepened
tone
of
eager
inquiry
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
certainly
interested
in
jewish
history
,
"
say
Deronda
,
quietly
,
curiosity
overcome
his
dislike
to
the
sort
of
inspection
as
well
as
question
he
be
under
.
  
<EOS>
but
immediately
the
strange
Jew
rise
from
his
sit
posture
,
and
Deronda
feel
a
thin
hand
press
his
arm
tightly
,
while
a
hoarse
,
excited
voice
,
not
much
above
a
loud
whisper
,
say
    
"
You
be
perhaps
of
our
race
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
color
deeply
,
not
like
the
grasp
,
and
then
answer
with
a
slight
shake
of
the
head
,
"
no
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
grasp
be
relax
,
the
hand
withdraw
,
the
eagerness
of
the
face
collapse
into
uninterested
melancholy
,
as
if
some
possess
spirit
which
have
leap
into
the
eye
and
gesture
have
sink
back
again
to
the
inmost
recess
of
the
frame
;
and
move
further
off
as
he
hold
out
the
little
book
,
the
stranger
say
in
a
tone
of
distant
civility
,
"
I
believe
Mr.
Ram
will
be
satisfied
with
half
-
a
-
crown
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
effect
of
this
change
on
Deronda
 
<EOS>
he
afterward
smile
when
he
recall
it
 
<EOS>
be
oddly
embarrassing
and
humiliating
,
as
if
some
high
dignitary
have
find
him
deficient
and
give
him
his
_
congé
_
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
further
to
be
say
,
however
:
he
pay
his
half
-
crown
and
carry
off
his
_
Salomon
Maimon
's
Lebensgeschichte
_
with
a
mere
"
good
-
morning
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
feel
some
vexation
at
the
sudden
arrest
of
the
interview
,
and
the
apparent
prohibition
that
he
should
know
more
of
this
man
,
who
be
certainly
something
out
of
the
common
way
 
as
different
probably
as
a
Jew
could
well
be
from
Ezra
Cohen
,
through
whose
door
Deronda
be
presently
enter
,
and
whose
flourish
face
glisten
on
the
way
to
fatness
be
hang
over
the
counter
in
negotiation
with
some
one
on
the
other
side
of
the
partition
,
concern
two
plate
stopper
and
three
teaspoon
,
which
lie
spread
before
him
.
<EOS>
see
Deronda
enter
,
he
call
out
"
Mother
!
<EOS>
mother
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
with
a
familiar
nod
and
smile
,
say
,
"
come
,
sir
 
come
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
Deronda
could
not
help
look
toward
the
door
from
the
back
with
some
anxiety
,
which
be
not
soothe
when
he
see
a
vigorous
woman
beyond
fifty
enter
and
approach
to
serve
him
.
<EOS>
not
that
there
be
anything
very
repulsive
about
her
:
<EOS>
the
bad
that
could
be
say
be
that
she
have
that
look
of
have
make
her
toilet
with
little
water
,
and
by
twilight
,
which
be
common
to
unyouthful
people
of
her
class
,
and
of
have
presumably
sleep
in
her
large
earring
,
if
not
in
her
ring
and
necklace
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
what
cause
a
sinking
of
heart
in
Deronda
be
,
her
not
be
so
coarse
and
ugly
as
to
exclude
the
idea
of
her
be
Mirah
's
mother
.
<EOS>
any
one
who
have
look
at
a
face
to
try
and
discern
sign
of
know
kinship
in
it
will
understand
his
process
of
conjecture
 
how
he
try
to
think
away
the
fat
which
have
gradually
disguise
the
outline
of
youth
,
and
to
discern
what
one
may
call
the
elementary
expression
of
the
face
.
<EOS>
He
be
sorry
to
see
no
absolute
negative
to
his
fear
.
<EOS>
just
as
it
be
conceivable
that
this
Ezra
,
bring
up
to
trade
,
may
resemble
the
scapegrace
father
in
everything
but
his
knowledge
and
talent
,
so
it
be
not
impossible
that
this
mother
may
have
have
a
lovely
refined
daughter
whose
type
of
feature
and
expression
be
like
Mirah
's
.
<EOS>
the
eyebrow
have
a
vexatious
similarity
of
line
;
and
who
shall
decide
how
far
a
face
may
be
mask
when
the
uncherishing
year
have
thrust
it
far
onward
in
the
ever
-
new
procession
of
youth
and
age
?
<EOS>
the
good
-
humor
of
the
glance
remain
and
shine
out
in
a
motherly
way
at
Deronda
,
as
she
say
,
in
a
mild
guttural
tone
    
"
how
can
I
serve
you
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
look
at
the
silver
clasp
in
the
window
,
"
say
Deronda
;
"
the
large
one
,
please
,
in
the
corner
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
be
not
quite
easy
to
get
at
from
the
mother
's
station
,
and
the
son
see
this
call
out
,
"
I
will
reach
'em
,
mother
;
I
will
reach
'
em
,
"
run
forward
with
alacrity
,
and
then
hand
the
clasp
to
Deronda
with
the
smile
remark
    
<EOS>
"
Mother
's
too
proud
:
she
want
to
do
everything
herself

<EOS>
that
be
why
I
call
her
to
wait
on
you

<EOS>
when
there
be
a
particular
gentleman
customer
,
sir
,
I
dare
not
do
any
other
than
call
her

<EOS>
but
I
can
not

her
do
herself
mischief
with
stretching

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
Mr.
Cohen
make
way
again
for
his
parent
,
who
give
a
little
guttural
,
amiable
laugh
while
she
look
at
Deronda
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
this
boy
will
be
at
his
joke
,
but
you
see
he
be
the
good
son
in
the
world
,
"
and
evidently
the
son
enjoy
please
her
,
though
he
also
wish
to
convey
an
apology
to
his
distinguished
customer
for
not
give
him
the
advantage
of
his
own
exclusive
attention
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
begin
to
examine
the
clasp
as
if
he
have
many
point
to
observe
before
he
could
come
to
a
decision
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
only
three
guinea

the

encouragingly
.
  
<EOS>
"

only
I
get
'em
a
bargain
from

"
say
the
son
,
parenthetically
,
from
a
distance
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
two
new
customer
enter
,
and
the
repeat
call
,
"
Addy

"
bring
from
the
back
of
the
shop
a
group
that
Deronda
turn
frankly
to
stare
at
,
feel
sure
that
the
stare
would
be
hold
complimentary
.
<EOS>
the
group
consist
of
a
black
-
eyed
young
woman
who
carry
a
black
-
eyed
little
one
,
its
head
already
cover
with
black
curl
,
and
deposit
it
on
the
counter
,
from
which
station
<EOS>
it
look
round
with
even
more
than
the
usual
intelligence
of
baby
:
<EOS>
also
a
robust
boy
of
six
and
a
young
girl
,
both
with
black
eye
and
black
-
ringed
hair
 
look
more
semitic
than
their
parent
,
as
the
puppy
lion
show
the
spot
of
far
-
off
progenitor
.
<EOS>
the
young
woman
answer
to
"
Addy
"
 
a
sort
of
paroquet
in
a
bright
blue
dress
,
with
coral
necklace
and
earring
,
her
hair
set
up
in
a
huge
bush
 
look
as
complacently
lively
and
unrefined
as
her
husband
;
and
by
a
certain
difference
from
the
mother
deepen
in
Deronda
the
unwelcome
impression
that
the
latter
be
not
so
utterly
common
a
Jewess
as
to
exclude
her
be
the
mother
of
Mirah
.
<EOS>
while
that
thought
be
glance
through
his
mind
,
the
boy
have
run
forward
into
the
shop
with
an
energetic
stamp
,
and
set
himself
about
four
foot
from
Deronda
,
with
his
hand
in
the
pocket
of
his
miniature
knickerbocker
,
look
at
him
with
a
precocious
air
of
survey
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
chiefly
with
a
diplomatic
design
to
linger
and
ingratiate
himself
that
Deronda
pat
the

head

Jacob

come
closer
.

His
small

hoarse

glibness

"

convey
the
impression

sympathetic
interest
 
which
on
this
occasion
answer
his
purpose
well

It

you

there

Her

close

she

down

sweep
her

outward
on

turn
her
back
on
Deronda
to
examine
some

<EOS>
Her
son
give
a
significant
glance
,
set
up
his

an

just
put
his

to

quickly
,
"
I

"
a
little

Deronda

take
up
the
clasp
a
moment
and
lay
them
down
again

<EOS>
that
unwelcome
bit
of
circumstantial
evidence
have
make
his

busy

be
certainly
more
like
act
than
anything

the
bare
possibility
that

nullify

overpower
the

Deronda
thus
leave
the
most

as

for
his

those
amenity
have
be
carry
on
under
the
heavy
spirit

if
these
be
really
Mirah

relative

he
could
not
imagine
that
even
her
fervid
filial
piety
could
give
the
reunion

any
sweetness
beyond
such
as
could

find
in
the
strict
fulfillment

a
painful
duty

<EOS>
what
do
this
vaunt
brother
need
?
<EOS>
and
with
the
most
favorable
supposition
about
the
hypothetic
mother
,
Deronda
shrink
from
the
image
of
a
first
meeting
between
her
and
Mirah
,
and
still
more
from
the
idea
of
Mirah
's
domestication
with
this
family

<EOS>
He
take
refuge
in
disbelief

<EOS>
to
find
an
Ezra
Cohen
when
the
name
be
run
in
your
head
be
no
more
extraordinary
than
to
find
a
Josiah
Smith
under
like
circumstance
;
and
as
to
the
coincidence
about
the
daughter
,
it
would
probably
turn
out
to
be
a
difference
.
<EOS>
if
,
however
,
further
knowledge
confirm
the
more
undesirable
conclusion
,
what
would
be
wise
expediency
?
 
<EOS>
to
try
and
determine
the
good
consequence
by
concealment
,
or
to
brave
other
consequence

when

into
the

behind

he
be

at
the
prettiness
of
the
scene

<EOS>
the
house
be
old
,
and
rather
extensive
at
the
back
:
probably
the
large
room
he
how
enter
be
gloomy
by
daylight
,
but
now
it
be
agreeably
light
by
a
fine
old
brass
lamp
with
seven
oil
-
light
hang
above
the
snow
-
white
cloth
spread
on
the
central
table
,
the
ceiling

be
smoky
,
and
all
the
surrounding
be
dark
enough
to
throw
into
relief
the
human
figure
,
which
have
a
venetian
glow
of
coloring
.
<EOS>
the
grandmother
be
array
in
yellowish
brown
with
a
large
gold
chain
in
lieu
of

,
and
by
this

her

face
with
its

eyebrow
and

of

look
as

young

<EOS>
as
the
four
pair
of
black
eye
all
glisten
a
welcome
at

,
he
be
almost
ashamed
of
the
supercilious
dislike
these
happy

creature
have
raise
in
him
by
daylight

<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
cordial
than
the

he
receive
,
and
both

seem
to
gather
more
dignity
from
be
see
on
the
private
hearth
,
show
hospitality

<EOS>
He
look
round
with
some
wonder
at
the
old
furniture
:
the
oaken
bureau
and
high
side
-
table
must
surely
be
mere
matter
of
chance
and
economy
,
and
not
due
to
the
family
taste
.
<EOS>
a
large
dish
of
blue

be
set
up
on

side

take
in

detail
by
parenthetic

while

pressing
solicitude
about

He
have
take
the
pain
to
buy

the
requisite
of
the
hook

white

produce

<EOS>
It
be
subject

the

the

be
draw
forth
for

"
why

"

"
what

Deronda

mindful

"

<EOS>
Jacob
look
up
into
his
face
scanningly
for
a
moment
or
two
,
and
apparently
arrive
at
his
conclusion
,
say
gravely
    
<EOS>
"
I
will
shwop
,
"
hand
the
cork
-
screw
knife
to
Deronda
,
who
pocket
it
with

gravity

<EOS>
immediately
the
small
son
of
Shem
run
off
into
the
next
room
,
whence
his
voice
be
hear
in
rapid
chat
;
and
then
run
back
again
 
when
,
see
his
father
enter
,
he
seize
a
little
velveteen
hat
which
lie
on
a
chair
and
put
it
on
to
approach
him
.
<EOS>
Cohen
keep
on
his
own
hat
,
and
take
no
notice
of
the
visitor
,
but
stand
still
while
the
two
child
go
up
to
him
and
clasp
his
knee
:
then
he
lay
his
hand
on
each
in
turn
and
utter
his
hebrew
benediction
;
whereupon
the
wife
,
who
have
lately
take
baby
from
the
cradle
,
bring
it
up
to
her
husband
and
hold
it
under
his
outstretched
hand
,
to
be
bless
in
its
sleep
.
<EOS>
for
the
moment
,
Deronda
think
that
this
pawnbroker
,
proud
of
his
vocation
,
be
not
utterly
prosaic
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
you
find
your
welcome
in
my

,
I
think
,
"
say
Cohen
,
put
down
his
hat
and
become
his
former
self
.
<EOS>
"
and
you
have
be
punctual
.
<EOS>
nothing
like
a
little
stress
here
,
"
he
add
,
tap
his
side
pocket
as
he
sit
down
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
good
for
us
all
in
our
turn
.
<EOS>
I
have
feel
it
when
I
have
have
to
make
up
payment
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
fit
every

Deronda
,
take
it
from
his
finger
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
cost
a
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
sufficient
pledge
to
you
for
fifty

I
think
.
<EOS>
I
shall
probably
redeem
it
in
a
month
or
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Cohen
's
glistening
eye
seem
to
get
a
little
nearer
together
as
he
meet
the
ingenuous
look
of
this
crude
young
gentleman
,
who
apparently
suppose
that
redemption
be
a
satisfaction
to
pawnbroker
.
<EOS>
He
take
the
ring
,
examine
and
return
it
,
say
with
indifference
,
"
good
,
good
.
<EOS>
We
will
talk
of
it
after
our
meal
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
will
join
us

if
you
have
no
objection

<EOS>
Me
and
my

feel
honored

so
will
mother

will
not
you

mother

"
  
<EOS>
the
invitation
be
doubly
echo
,
and
Deronda
gladly
accept
it
.
<EOS>
all
now
turn
and
stand
round
the
table
.
<EOS>
no
dish
be
at
present
see
except
one
cover
with
a
napkin
;
and
Mrs.
Cohen
have
place
a
china
bowl
near
her
husband
that
he
may
wash
his
hand
in
it
.
<EOS>
but
after
put
on
his
hat
again
,
he
pause
,
and
call
in
a
loud
voice
,
"
Mordecai
!
"
  
<EOS>
Can
this
be
part
of
the
religious
ceremony
?
<EOS>
think
Deronda
,
not
know
what
may
be
expect
of
the
ancient
hero
.
<EOS>
but
he
hear
a
"
yes
"
from
the
next
room
,
which
make
him
look
toward
the
open
door
;
and
there
,
to
his
astonishment
,
he
see
the
figure
of
the
enigmatic
Jew
whom
he
have
this
morning
meet
with
in
the
book
-
shop
.
<EOS>
Their
eye
meet
,
and
Mordecai
look
as
much
surprised
as
Deronda
 
neither
in
his
surprise
make
any
sign
of
recognition
.
<EOS>
but
when
Mordecai
be
seat
himself
at
the
end
of
the
table
,
he
just
bend
his
head
to
the
guest
in
a
cold
and
distant
manner
,
as
if
the
disappointment
of
the
morning
remain
a
disagreeable
association
with
this
new
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
Cohen
now
wash
his
hand
,
pronounce
Hebrew
word
the
while
<EOS>
:
afterward

take
off

Deronda

<EOS>
He
be
not
very
conscious
of
what
dish
he
eat
from
;
be
preoccupy
with
a
desire
to
turn
the
conversation
in
a
way
that
would
enable
him
to
ask
some

question

also
think
of
Mordecai

there
be
an
exchange

fascinated

half
furtive
glance

<EOS>
Mordecai
have

instead
of

coat
of

morning
he
wear
one
of
light
drab
,
which
look
as
if
it
have
once
be
a
handsome
loose

this
change
of
clothing
give
a
still
strong
accentuation
to
his
dark

haired
,
eager
face
which
may
have
belong
to
the
prophet
Ezekiel
 
also
probably
not
modish
in

eye
of

<EOS>
It
be
noticeable
that
the
thin
tail
of

be
give
to
Mordecai
;
and
in
general
the
sort
of

assign
to
a

a

Mordecai

who
be
now
look
at
Deronda
with
what
seem
a
revival

it
seem
as
if
the

now
neutralize

after

he

"
I

<EOS>
Mordecai

he
cast
down
his

look
at
his
hand
,
which
lie
cross
before
him

and
say
no
more

<EOS>
Deronda
have
now
notice
more
decisively
than
in
their
former
interview
a
difficulty
in
breathing
,
which
he
think
must
be
a
sign
of
consumption
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
have
something
else
to

learning

say
Mr.

<EOS>
"
I

here
he
point
to
Deronda

<EOS>
"
I

not
afraid

take
that

now

"
he
add
,
with
a
certain
drop
in
his

to
a
low

more

nasal
,

<EOS>
"
fifty

sixty

Deronda
answer
,
rather
too
carelessly

<EOS>
Cohen
pause
a
little
,
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
,
fix
on
Deronda
a
pair
of
glisten
eye
that
suggest
a
miraculous
guinea

pig
,
and
say
,
"
Could

<EOS>
happy

Deronda
be
aware
that
Mordecai
have
look
up
again
at
the
word
imply
a
monetary
affair
,
and
be
now
examine
him
again
,
while
he

,
"
very
well

I
shall
redeem
it
in

so

"
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
I
will
make

out
the

by

say
Cohen
,
indifferently
.
<EOS>
then
he
hold
up
his
finger
as
a
sign
that
conversation
must
be
defer
.
<EOS>
He
,
Mordecai
and
Jacob
put
on
their
hat
,
and
Cohen
open
a
thanksgiving
,
which
be
carry
on
by
response
,
till
Mordecai
deliver
himself
alone
at
some
length
,
in
a
solemn
chant
tone
,
with
his
chin
slightly
uplifted
and
his
thin
hand
clasp
easily
before
him
.
<EOS>
not
only
in
his
accent
and
tone
,
but
in
his
freedom
from
the
self
-
consciousness
which
have
reference
to
other
'
approbation
,
there
could
hardly
have
be
a
strong
contrast
to
the
Jew
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
unaccountable
conjunction
 
<EOS>
the
presence
among
these
common
,
prosperous
,
shopkeepe
type
,
of
a
man
who
,
in
an
emaciated
threadbare
condition
,
impose
a
certain
awe
on
Deronda
,
and
an
embarrassment
at
not
meet
his
expectation
.
  
<EOS>
no
sooner
have
Mordecai
finish
his
devotional
strain
,
than
rise
,
with
a
slight
bend
of
his
head
to
the
stranger
,
he
walk
back
into
his
room
,
and
shut
the
door
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
seem
to
be
rather
a
remarkable
man
,
"
say
Deronda
,
turn
to
Cohen
,
who
immediately
set
up
his
shoulder
,
put
out
his
tongue
slightly
,
and
tap
his
own
brow
.
<EOS>
It
be
clearly
to
be
understand
that
Mordecai
do
not
come
up
to
the
standard
of
sanity
which
be
set
by
Mr.
Cohen
's
view
of
man
and
thing

<EOS>
"
do
he
belong
to
your
family

"
say
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
this
idea
appear
to
be
rather
ludicrous
to
the
lady
as
well
as
to
Cohen
,
and
the
family
interchange
look
of
amusement
.
  
<EOS>
"
no

no

say
Cohen

<EOS>
"

He
be
an
incumbrance

down

he

besides

he
do

<EOS>
"
  
Deronda
hardly
abstain
from
smile
at
this
mixture
of
kindliness
and
the
desire
to
justify
it
in
the
light
of
a
calculation
;
but
his
willingness
to
speak
further
of
Mordecai
,
whose
character
be
make
the
more
enigmatically
striking
by
these
new
detail
,
be
baffle
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cohen
immediately
dismiss
the
subject
by
revert
to
the
"
accommodation
,
"
which
be
also
an
act
of
charity
,
and
proceed
to
make
out
the
ticket
,
get
the
forty
pound
,
and
present
them
both
in
exchange
for
the
diamond
ring

<EOS>
Deronda
,
feel
that
it
would
be
hardly
delicate
to
protract
his
visit
beyond
the
settlement
of
the
business
which
be
its
pretext

have
to
take
his
leave

with
no
more

result

the
advance
of
forty
pound

the
pawn

in

pocket

to
make
a
reason
for
return
when
he
come
up
to
town
after
Christmas

<EOS>
He
be
resolve
that
he
would
then
endeavor
to
gain
a
little
more
insight
into
the
character
and
history
of
Mordecai
;
from
whom
also
he
may
gather
something
decisive
about
the
Cohens
 
for
example
,
the
reason
why
it
be
forbid
to
ask
Mrs.
Cohen
the
elder
whether
she
have
a
daughter

MORDECAI

by
extent

human
    
history

one

look
to
see
the

of
greedy

the
mighty
marauder
of
the

the

his

his

<EOS>
no

wickedness
hath
its
reward
to
distribute

who
so
    
win
in
this
devil

more
brutal

the

<EOS>
on
the
twenty
-
ninth
of
December
Deronda
know
that
the
Grandcourts
have
arrive
at
the
Abbey
,
but
he
have
have
no
glimpse
of
them
before
he
go
to
dress
for
dinner
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
splendid
fall
of
snow
,
allow
the
party
of
child
the
rare
pleasure
of
snow
-
ball
and
snow
-
building
,
and
in
the
Christmas
holiday
the
mallinger
girl
be
content
with
no
amusement
unless
it
be
join
in
and
manage
by
"
cousin

as
they
have
always
call
Deronda

<EOS>
after
that
outdoor
exertion
he
have
be
play
billiard
,
and
thus
the
hour
have
pass
without
his
dwelling
at
all
on
the
prospect
of
meet
Gwendolen
at
dinner

nevertheless
that
prospect
be
interesting
to
him
;
and
when
,
a
little
tired
and
heat
with
work
at
amusement
,
he
go
to
his
room
before
the
half
-
hour
bell
have
ring
<EOS>
,
he
begin
to
think
of
it
with
some
speculation
on
the
sort
of
influence
her
marriage
with
Grandcourt
would
have
on
her
,
and
on
the
probability
that
there
would
be
some
discernible
shade
of
change
in
her
manner
since
he
see
her
at
Diplow
,
just
as
there
have
be
since
his
first
vision
of
her
at
Leubronn
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
there
be
some
nature
one
could
see
grow
or
degenerate
every
day
,
if
one
watch
them
,
"
be
his
thought
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
some
of
us
go
on
faster
than
other
:
and
I
be
sure
she
be
a
creature
who
keep
strong
trace
of
anything
that
have
once
impress
her
.
<EOS>
that
little
affair
of
the
necklace
,
and
the
idea
that
somebody
think
her
gambling
wrong
,
have
evidently
bite
into
her
.
<EOS>
but
such
impressibility
lead
both
way
:
it
may
drive
one
to
desperation
as
soon
as
to
anything
well

<EOS>
and
whatever
fascination
Grandcourt
may
have
for
capricious
taste
 
<EOS>
good
heaven
!
<EOS>
who
can
believe
that
he
would
call
out
the
tender
affection
in
daily
companionship
?
<EOS>
one
may
be
tempt
to
horsewhip
him
for
the
sake
of
get
some
show
of
passion
into
his
face
and
speech
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
she
marry
him
out
of
ambition
 
to
escape
poverty

<EOS>

why
do
she
run
out
of
his
way
at
first

come
after

<EOS>
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
she
may
have
be
urge
into
it
.
<EOS>
how
can
one
feel
anything
else
than
pity
for
a
young
creature
like
that
 
full
of
unused
life
 
ignorantly
rash
 
hang
all
her
blind
expectation
on
that
remnant
of
a
human
being
.
"
  
<EOS>
doubtless
<EOS>
the
phrase
which
Deronda
's
meditation
apply
to
the
bridegroom
be
the
less
complimentary
for
the
excuse
and
pity
in
which
it
clothe
the
bride
.
<EOS>
His
notion
of
Grandcourt
as
a
"
remnant
"
be
found
on
no
particular
knowledge
,
but
simply
on
the
impression
which
ordinary
polite
intercourse
have
give
him
that
Grandcourt
have
wear
out
all
his
natural
healthy
interest
in
thing
.
  
<EOS>
in
general
,
one
may
be
sure
that
whenever
a
marriage
of
any
mark
take
place
,
male
acquaintance
be
likely
to
pity
the
bride
,
female
acquaintance
<EOS>
the
bridegroom
:
each
,
it
be
think
,
may
have
do
better
;
and
especially
where
the
bride
be
charming
,
young
gentleman
on
the
scene
be
apt
to
conclude
that
she
can
have
no
real
attachment
to
a
fellow
so
uninteresting
to
themselves
as
her
husband
,
but
have
marry
him
on
other
ground
.
<EOS>
who
,
under
such
circumstance
,
pity
the
husband
?
<EOS>
even
his
female
friend
be
apt
to
think
his
position
retributive
:
he
should
have
choose
some
one
else
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
Deronda
may
be
excuse
that
he
do
not
prepare
any
pity
for
Grandcourt
,
who
have
never
strike
acquaintance
as
likely
to
come
out
of
his
experience
with
more
suffering
than
he
inflict
;
whereas
,
for
Gwendolen
,
young
,
headlong
,
eager
for
pleasure
,
feed
with
the
flattery
which
make
a
lovely
girl
believe
in
her
divine
right
to
rule
 
how
quickly
may
life
turn
from
expectancy
to
a
bitter
sense
of
the
irremediable
!
<EOS>
after
what
he
have
see
of
her
he
must
have
have
rather
dull
feeling
not
to
have
look
forward
with
some
interest
to
her
entrance
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
still
,
since
the
honeymoon
be
already
three
week
in
the
distance
,
and
Gwendolen
have
be
enthrone
,
not
only
at
Ryelands
,
but
at
Diplow
,
she
be
likely
to
have
compose
her
countenance
with
suitable
manifestation
or
concealment
,
not
be
one
who
would
indulge
the
curious
by
a
helpless
exposure
of
her
feeling
.

the

most
of
the

rather
aloof

converse
with
that
very
moderate

observable
during

long

<EOS>
Deronda

upon

by
Mr.
Vandernoodt

a
man
of
the
good

import
at

for
the
rest

one
of
those
commodious
person
in
society
who
be
nothing
particular
themselves
,
but
be
understand
to
be
acquaint
with
the
good
in
every
department
;
close

clip
,
pale

_
nonchalant
_
,
as
good
a
foil
as
could
well
be
find
to
the
intense

vivid
gravity
of
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
talk
of
the
bride

bridegroom
,
whose
appearance
be
be
wait
for

<EOS>
Mr.
Vandernoodt
be
an
industrious
gleaner
of
personal
detail
,
and
could
probably
tell
everything
about
a
great
philosopher
or
physicist
except
his
theory
or
discovery
;
he
be
now
imply
that
he
have
learn
many
fact
about
Grandcourt
since
meet
him
at

<EOS>
"
man
who
have
see
a
good

not
always
end

so
well

<EOS>
He
have
have
rather
an
anecdotic
history
 
go
rather
deep
into
pleasure
,
I
fancy
,
lazy
as
he
be
.
<EOS>
but
,
of
course
,
you
know
all
about
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
really
,
"
say
Deronda
,
in
an
indifferent
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
little
more
of
him
than
that
he
be
Sir
Hugo
's
nephew

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
now
the
door
open
and
defer
any
satisfaction
of
Mr.
Vandernoodt
's
communicativeness
.
  
<EOS>
the
scene
be
one
to
set
off
any
figure
of
distinction
that
enter
on
it
,
and
certainly
when
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Grandcourt
enter
,
no
beholder
could
deny
that
their
figure
have
distinction
.
<EOS>
the
bridegroom
have
neither
more
nor
less
easy
perfection
of
costume
,
neither
more
nor
less
well
-
cut
impassibility
of
face
,
than
before
his
marriage
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
suppose
of
him
that
he
would
put
up
with
nothing
less
than
the
good
in
outward
equipment
,
wife
include
;
and
the
bride
be
what
he
may
have
be
expect
to
choose
.
"
<EOS>
by
George

I
think
she
be
handsome

if
anything
!
"
say
Mr.
Vandernoodt
.
<EOS>
and
Deronda
be
of
the
same
opinion
,
but
he
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
the
white
silk
and
diamond
 
it
may
seem
strange
,
but
she
do
wear
diamond
on
her
neck
,
in
her
ear
,
in
her
hair
 
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
new
imposingness
of
her
beauty
,
which
flash
on
him
as
more
unquestionable
if
not
more
thoroughly
satisfactory
than
when
he
have
first
see
her
at
the
gaming
-
table
.
<EOS>
some
face
which
be
peculiar
in
their
beauty
be
like
original
work
of
art
:
for
the
first
time
they
be
almost
always
meet
with
question
.
<EOS>
but
in
see
Gwendolen
at
Diplow
,
Deronda
have
discern
in
her
more
than
he
have
expect
of
that
tender
appeal
charm
which
we
call
womanly
.
<EOS>
be
there
any
new
change
since
then
?
<EOS>
He
distrust
his
impression
;
but
as
he
see
her
receive
greeting
with
what
seem
a
proud
cold
quietude
and
a
superficial
smile
,
there
seem
to
be
at
work
within
her
the
same
demonic
force
that
have
possess
her
when
she
take
him
in
her
resolute
glance
and
turn
away
a
loser
from
the
gaming
-
table
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
time
for
more
of
a
conclusion
 
no
time
even
for
him
to
give
his
greeting
before
the
summon
to
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
He
sit
not
far
from
opposite
to
her
at
table
,
and
could
sometimes
hear
what
she
say
in
answer
to
Sir
Hugo
,
who
be
at
his
lively
in
conversation
with
her
;
but
though
he
look
toward
her
with
the
intention
of
bowing
,
she
give
him
no
opportunity
of
do
so
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
at
last
Sir
Hugo
,
who
may
have
imagine
that
they
have
already
speak
to
each
other
,
say
,
"
Deronda
,
you
will
like

what
Mrs.

tell
me
about
your

<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
eyelid
have
be
lower

and
Deronda
,
already
look
at
her

think
he
discover
a
quivering
reluctance
as
she
be
oblige
to
raise
them
and
return
his
unembarrassed
bow
and
smile
,
her
own
smile
be
one
of
the
lip
merely
.
<EOS>
It
be
but
an
instant
,
and
Sir
Hugo
continue
without
pause
    
<EOS>
"
the
Arrowpoints
have
condone
the

suppose
he

Deronda

It
be
a

an

I
have
no

bitterness

Deronda
be
wonder
what
he
should
have

if

never

probably
that

put
on
a
little
hardness

defiance

way

conceal
some
painful
consciousness

,
indeed
,
he
could
imagine
her
manner
otherwise

in
the
light
of
his
suspicion

why
do
she
not
recognize
him
with
more
friendliness

<EOS>
Sir

,
by
way
of
change
the
subject

say
to
her
,
"
be
not
this
a
beautiful
room
?
<EOS>
It
be
part
of
the
refectory
of
the
Abbey

there
be
a
division
make
by
those
pillar

the

afterward
they

build
up

else
it

half

originally

there
use
to

suppose
we

the
ghost

the
old
monk
rise
behind
all
our
chair

<EOS>
"
please
do
not
!

say
Gwendolen
,
with
a
playful
shudder

<EOS>
"
It
be
very
nice
to
come
after
ancestor

they

know
their
place

I
should
be
rather
frightened

oh

the

<EOS>
Gwendolen
steal
a
glance
at
Deronda

must
have
hear
what
Sir

say

for
he
have
his
face
turn
toward

help
himself
to
an
_

he
look
as
impassive
as
a
picture

<EOS>
at
the
notion
of
Deronda

show
her

Grandcourt
the
place
which
be
to
be
theirs

and
which
she
with
painful
emphasis
remember
may
have
be
his
(
perhaps
,
if
other
have
act
differently
)
,
certain
thought
have
rush
in
 
thought
repeat
within
her
,
but
now
return
on
an
occasion
embarrassingly
new
;
and
be
conscious
of
something
furtive
and
awkward
in
her
glance
which
Sir
Hugo
must
have
notice
.

with
her
usual
readiness
of
resource
against
betrayal

,
playfully
,
"

"
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
that
?
<EOS>
because
you
think
him
too
learn
?
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
whom
the
peculiarity
of
her
glance
have
not
escape
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
.
<EOS>
It
be
ever
since
I
first
see
him
at
Leubronn
.
<EOS>
because
when
he
come
to
look
on
at
the
roulette
-
table
,
I
begin
to
lose
.
<EOS>
He
cast
an
evil
eye
on
my
play
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
approve
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
me
so
.
<EOS>
and
now
whatever
I
do
before
him
,
I
be
afraid
he
will
cast
an
evil
eye
upon
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gad
!
<EOS>
I
be
rather
afraid
of
him
myself
when
he
do
not
approve
,
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
glance
at
Deronda
;
and
then
turn
his
face
toward
Gwendolen
<EOS>
,
he
say
less
audibly
,
"
I
do
not
think
lady
generally
object
to
have
his
eye
upon
them
.
"
<EOS>
the
baronet
's
small
chronic
complaint
of
facetiousness
be
at
this
moment
almost
as
annoying
to
Gwendolen
as
it
often
be
to
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
object
to
any
eye
that
be
critical
,
"
she
say
,
in
a
cool
,
high
voice
,
with
a
turn
of
her
neck
.
"
<EOS>
be
there
many
of
these
old
room
leave
in
the
Abbey
?
"
  
"
not
many
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
fine
cloister
court
with
a
long
gallery
above
it
.
<EOS>
but
the
fine
bit
of
all
be
turn
into
stable
.
<EOS>
It
be
part
of
the
old
church
.
<EOS>
when
I
improve
the
place
I
make
the
most
of
every
other
bit
;
but
it
be
out
of
my
reach
to
change
the
stable
,
so
the
horse
have
the
benefit
of
the
fine
old
choir
.
<EOS>
You
must
go
and
see
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
like
to
see
the
horse
as
well
as
the
building
,
"
say
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
have
no
stud
to
speak
of
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
will
look
with
contempt
at
my
horse
,
"
say
Sir
Hugo
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
give
up
hunting
,
and
go
on
in
a
jog
-
trot
way
,
as
become
an
old
gentleman
with
daughter
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
I
go
in
for
do
too
much
at
this
place
.
<EOS>
We
all
live
at
Diplow
for
two
year
while
the
alteration
be
go
on
:
do
you
like
Diplow
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
particularly
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
with
indifference
.
<EOS>
one
would
have
think
that
the
young
lady
have
all
her
life
have
more
family
seat
than
she
care
to
go
to
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
it
will
not
do
after
Ryelands
,
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
well
pleased
.
<EOS>
"
Grandcourt
,
I
know
,
take
it
for
the
sake
of
the
hunting
.
<EOS>
but
he
find
something
so
much
well
there
,
"
add
the
baronet
,
lower
his
voice
,
"
that
he
may
well
prefer
it
to
any
other
place
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
have
one
attraction
for
me
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
pass
over
this
compliment
with
a
chill
smile
,
"
that
it
be
within
reach
of
offendene
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
that
,
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
and
then
let
the
subject
drop
.
  
<EOS>
what
amiable
baronet
can
escape
the
effect
of
a
strong
desire
for
a
particular
possession
?
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
would
have
be
glad
that
Grandcourt
,
with
or
without
reason
,
should
prefer
any
other
place
to
diplow
;
but
inasmuch
as
in
the
pure
process
of
wish
<EOS>
we
can
always
make
the
condition
of
our
gratification
benevolent
,
he
do
wish
that
Grandcourt
's
convenient
disgust
for
Diplow
should
not
be
associate
with
his
marriage
with
this
very
charming
bride
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
be
much
to
the
baronet
's
taste
,
but
,
as
he
observe
afterward
to
Lady
Mallinger
,
he
should
never
have
take
her
for
a
young
girl
who
have
marry
beyond
her
expectation
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
have
not
hear
much
of
this
conversation
,
have
give
his
attention
elsewhere
,
but
the
glimpse
he
have
of
Gwendolen
's
manner
deepen
the
impression
that
it
have
something
newly
artificial
.
  
<EOS>
later
,
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
Deronda
,
at
somebody
's
request
,
sit
down
to
the
piano
and
sing
.
<EOS>
afterward
,
Mrs.
Raymond
take
his
place
;
and
on
rise
he
observe
that
Gwendolen
have
leave
her
seat
,
and
have
come
to
this
end
of
the
room
,
as
if
to
listen
more
fully
,
but
be
now
stand
with
her
back
to
every
one
,
apparently
contemplate
a
fine
cowl
head
carve
in
ivory
which
hang
over
a
small
table
.
<EOS>
He
long
to
go
to
her
and
speak
.
<EOS>
why
should
he
not
obey
such
an
impulse
,
as
he
would
have
do
toward
any
other
lady
in
the
room
?
<EOS>
yet
he
hesitate
some
moment
,
observe
the
graceful
line
of
her
back
,
but
not
move
.
  
<EOS>
if
you
have
any
reason
for
not
indulge
a
wish
to
speak
to
a
fair
woman
,
it
be
a
bad
plan
to
look
long
at
her
back
:
the
wish
to
see
what
it
screen
become
the
strong
.
<EOS>
there
may
be
a
very
sweet
smile
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
Deronda
end
by
go
to
the
end
of
the
small
table
,
at
right
angle
to
Gwendolen
's
position
,
but
before
he
could
speak
she
have
turn
on
him
no
smile
,
but
such
an
appealing
look
of
sadness
,
so
utterly
different
from
the
chill
effort
of
her
recognition
at
table
,
that
his
speech
be
check
.
<EOS>
for
what
be
an
appreciative
space
of
time
to
both
,
though
the
observation
of
other
could
not
have
measure
it
,
they
look
at
each
other
 
she
seem
to
take
the
deep
rest
of
confession
,
<EOS>
he
with
an
answering
depth
of
sympathy
that
neutralize
all
other
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
not
join
in
the
music
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
by
way
of
meet
the
necessity
for
speech
.
  
<EOS>
that
her
look
of
confession
have
be
involuntary
be
show
by
that
just
perceptible
shake
and
change
of
countenance
with
which
she
rouse
herself
to
reply
calmly
,
"
I
join
in
it
by
listen
.
<EOS>
I
be
fond
of
music
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
not
a
musician
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
give
a
great
deal
of
time
to
music
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
not
talent
enough
to
make
it
worth
while
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
sing
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
if
you
be
fond
of
music
,
it
will
always
be
worth
while
in
private
,
for
your
own
delight
.
<EOS>
I
make
it
a
virtue
to
be
content
with
my
middlingness
,
"
say
Deronda
,
smile
;
"
it
be
always
pardonable
,
so
that
one
do
not
ask
other
to
take
it
for
superiority
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
imitate
you
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
recover
her
tone
of
artificial
vivacity
.
<EOS>
"
to
be
middling
with
me
be
another
phrase
for
be
dull
.
<EOS>
and
the
bad
fault
I
have
to
find
with
the
world
be
,
that
it
be
dull
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
I
be
go
to
justify
gambling
in
spite
of
you
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
refuge
from
dullness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
admit
the
justification
,
"
say
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
what
we
call
the
dullness
of
thing
be
a
disease
in
ourselves
.
<EOS>
else
how
can
any
one
find
an
intense
interest
in
life
?
<EOS>
and
many
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
I
see
!
<EOS>
the
fault
I
find
in
the
world
be
my
own
fault
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
smile
at
him
.
<EOS>
then
after
a
moment
,
look
up
at
the
ivory
again
,
she
say
,
"
do
_
you
_
never
find
fault
with
the
world
or
with
other
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
in
a
grumble
mood
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
hate
people
?
<EOS>
confess
you
hate
them
when
they
stand
in
your
way
 
when
their
gain
be
your
loss
?
<EOS>
that
be
your
own
phrase
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
often
stand
in
each
other
's
way
when
we
can
not
help
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
stupid
to
hate
people
on
that
ground
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
if
they
injure
you
and
could
have
help
it
?
"
say
Gwendolen
with
a
hard
intensity
unaccountable
in
incidental
talk
like
this
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
wonder
at
her
choice
of
subject
.
<EOS>
a
painful
impression
arrest
his
answer
a
moment
,
but
at
last
he
say
,
with
a
graver
,
deep
intonation
,
"
why
,
then
,
after
all
,
I
prefer
my
place
to
theirs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
I
believe
you
be
right
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
with
a
sudden
little
laugh
,
and
turn
to
join
the
group
at
the
piano
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
look
around
for
Grandcourt
,
wonder
whether
he
follow
his
bride
's
movement
with
any
attention
;
but
it
be
rather
undiscerning
to
him
to
suppose
that
he
could
find
out
the
fact
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
have
a
delusive
mood
of
observe
whatever
have
an
interest
for
him
,
which
could
be
surpass
by
no
sleepy
-
eyed
animal
on
the
watch
for
prey
.
<EOS>
at
that
moment
he
be
plunge
in
the
depth
of
an
easy
chair
,
be
talk
to
by
Mr.
Vandernoodt
,
who
apparently
think
the
acquaintance
of
such
a
bridegroom
worth
cultivate
;
and
an
incautious
person
may
have
suppose
it
safe
to
telegraph
secret
in
front
of
him
,
the
common
prejudice
be
that
your
quick
observer
be
one
whose
eye
have
quick
movement
.
<EOS>
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
if
you
want
a
respectable
witness
who
will
see
nothing
inconvenient
,
choose
a
vivacious
gentleman
,
very
much
on
the
alert
,
with
two
eye
wide
open
,
a
glass
in
one
of
them
,
and
an
entire
impartiality
as
to
the
purpose
of
look
.
<EOS>
if
Grandcourt
care
to
keep
any
one
under
his
power
he
see
them
out
of
the
corner
of
his
long
narrow
eye
,
and
if
they
go
behind
him
he
have
a
constructive
process
by
which
he
know
what
they
be
do
there
.
<EOS>
He
know
perfectly
well
where
his
wife
be
,
and
how
she
be
behave
.
<EOS>
be
he
go
to
be
a
jealous
husband
?
<EOS>
Deronda
imagine
that
to
be
likely
;
but
his
imagination
be
as
much
astray
about
Grandcourt
as
it
would
have
be
about
an
unexplored
continent
where
all
the
specie
be
peculiar
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
conceive
that
he
himself
be
a
likely
subject
of
jealousy
,
or
that
he
should
give
any
pretext
for
it
;
but
the
suspicion
that
a
wife
be
not
happy
naturally
lead
one
to
speculate
on
the
husband
's
private
deportment
;
and
Deronda
find
himself
after
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
in
the
rather
ludicrous
position
of
sit
up
severely
hold
a
hebrew
grammar
in
his
hand
(
for
somehow
,
in
deference
to
Mordecai
,
he
have
begin
to
study
Hebrew
)
,
with
the
consciousness
that
he
have
be
in
that
attitude
nearly
an
hour
,
and
have
think
of
nothing
but
Gwendolen
and
her
husband
.
<EOS>
to
be
an
unusual
young
man
mean
for
the
most
part
to
get
a
difficult
mastery
over
the
usual
,
which
be
often
like
the
sprite
of
ill
-
luck
you
pack
up
your
good
to
escape
from
,
and
see
grin
at
you
from
the
top
of
your
luggage
van
.
<EOS>
the
peculiarity
of
Deronda
's
nature
have
be
acutely
touch
by
the
brief
incident
and
word
which
make
the
history
of
his
intercourse
with
Gwendolen
;
and
this
evening
's
slight
addition
have
give
them
an
importunate
recurrence
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
vanity
 
<EOS>
it
be
ready
sympathy
that
have
make
him
alive
to
a
certain
appealingness
in
her
behavior
toward
him
;
and
the
difficulty
with
which
she
have
seem
to
raise
her
eye
to
bow
to
him
,
in
the
first
instance
,
be
to
be
interpret
now
by
that
unmistakable
look
of
involuntary
confidence
which
she
have
afterward
turn
on
him
under
the
consciousness
of
his
approach
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
use
of
it
all
?
"
think
Deronda
,
as
he
throw
down
his
grammar
,
and
begin
to
undress
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
do
anything
to
help
her
 
nobody
can
,
if
she
have
find
out
her
mistake
already
.
<EOS>
and
it
seem
to
me
that
she
have
a
dreary
lack
of
the
idea
that
may
help
her
.
<EOS>
strange
and
piteous
to
human
flesh
like
that
may
be
,
wrap
round
with
fine
raiment
,
her
ear
pierce
for
gem
,
her
head
hold
loftily
,
her
mouth
all
smile
pretence
,
the
poor
soul
within
her
sit
in
sick
distaste
of
all
thing
!
<EOS>
but
what
do
I
know
of
her
?
<EOS>
there
may
be
a
demon
in
her
to
match
the
bad
husband
,
for
what
I
can
tell
.
<EOS>
She
be
clearly
an
ill
-
educate
,
worldly
girl
:
perhaps
she
be
a
coquette
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
last
reflection
,
not
much
believe
in
,
be
a
self
-
administer
dose
of
caution
,
prompt
partly
by
Sir
Hugo
's
much
-
contemn
joking
on
the
subject
of
flirtation
.
<EOS>
Deronda
resolve
not
to
volunteer
any
_
tete
-
à
-
tete
_
with
Gwendolen
during
the
day
of
her
stay
at
the
Abbey
;
and
he
be
capable
of
keep
a
resolve
in
spite
of
much
inclination
to
the
contrary
.
  
<EOS>
but
a
man
can
not
resolve
about
a
woman
's
action
,
least
of
all
about
those
of
a
woman
like
Gwendolen
,
in
whose
nature
there
be
a
combination
of
proud
reserve
with
rashness
,
of
perilously
poise
terror
with
defiance
,
which
may
alternately
flatter
and
disappoint
control
.
<EOS>
few
word
could
less
represent
her
than
"
coquette
.
"
<EOS>
She
have
native
love
of
homage
,
and
belief
in
her
own
power
;
but
no
cold
artifice
for
the
sake
of
enslaving
.
<EOS>
and
the
poor
thing
's
belief
in
her
power
,
with
her
other
dream
before
marriage
,
have
often
to
be
thrust
aside
now
like
the
toy
of
a
sick
child
,
which
it
look
at
with
dull
eye
,
and
have
no
heart
to
play
with
,
however
it
may
try

<EOS>
the
next
day
at
lunch
Sir
Hugo
say
to
her
,
"
the
thaw
have
go
on
like
magic
,
and
it
be
so
pleasant
out
of
door
just
now
 
<EOS>
shall
we
go
and
see
the
stable
and
the
other
odd
bit
about
the
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
,
pray
,
"
say
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
like
to
see
the
stable
,
Henleigh
?
"
<EOS>
she
add
,
look
at
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
uncommonly
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
with
an
indifference
which
seem
to
give
irony
to
the
word
,
as
he
return
her
look
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
time
Deronda
have
see
them
speak
to
each
other
since
their
arrival
,
and
he
think
their
exchange
of
look
as
cold
or
official
as
if
it
have
be
a
ceremony
to
keep
up
a
charter
.
<EOS>
still
,
the
english
fondness
for
reserve
will
account
for
much
negation
;
and
Grandcourt
's
manner
with
an
extra
veil
of
reserve
over
them
may
be
expect
to
present
the
extreme
type
of
the
national
taste
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
else
be
inclined
to
make
the
tour
of
the
house
and
premise
?
"
say
Sir
Hugo
.
<EOS>
"
the
lady
must
muffle
themselves
;
there
be
only
just
about
time
to
do
it
well
before
sunset
.
<EOS>
You
will
go
,
Dan
,
will
not
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
"
say
Deronda
,
carelessly
,
know
that
Sir
Hugo
would
think
any
excuse
disoblige
.
  
<EOS>
"
all
meet
in
the
library
,
then
,
when
they
be
ready
 
say
in
half
an
hour
,
"
say
the
baronet
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
make
herself
ready
with
wonderful
quickness
,
and
in
ten
minute
come
down
into
the
library
in
her
sable
,
plume
,
and
little
thick
boot
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
enter
the
room
she
be
aware
that
some
one
else
be
there
:
it
be
precisely
what
she
have
hope
for
.
<EOS>
Deronda
be
stand
with
his
back
toward
her
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
,
and
be
look
over
a
newspaper
.
<EOS>
how
could
little
thick
boot
make
any
noise
on
an
Axminster
carpet
?
<EOS>
and
to
cough
would
have
seem
an
intended
signaling
which
her
pride
could
not
condescend
to
;
also
,
she
feel
bashful
about
walk
up
to
him
and
let
him
know
that
she
be
there
,
though
it
be
her
hunger
to
speak
to
him
which
have
set
her
imagination
on
construct
this
chance
of
find
him
,
and
have
make
her
hurry
down
,
as
bird
hover
near
the
water
which
they
dare
not
drink
.
<EOS>
always
uneasily
dubious
about
his
opinion
of
her
,
she
feel
a
peculiar
anxiety
to
-
day
,
lest
he
may
think
of
her
with
contempt
,
as
one
triumphantly
conscious
of
be
Grandcourt
's
wife
,
the
future
lady
of
this
domain
.
<EOS>
It
be
her
habitual
effort
now
to
magnify
the
satisfaction
of
her
pride
,
on
which
she
nourish
her
strength
;
but
somehow
Deronda
's
be
there
disturb
them
all
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
the
faint
touch
of
coquetry
in
the
attitude
of
her
mind
toward
him
:
he
be
unique
to
her
among
man
,
because
he
have
impress
her
as
be
not
her
admirer
but
her
superior
:
in
some
mysterious
way
he
be
become
a
part
of
her
conscience
,
as
one
woman
whose
nature
be
an
object
of
reverential
belief
may
become
a
new
conscience
to
a
man
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
he
would
not
look
round
and
find
out
that
she
be
there
!
<EOS>
the
paper
crackle
in
his
hand
,
his
head
rise
and
sink
,
explore
those
stupid
column
,
and
he
be
evidently
stroke
his
beard
;
as
if
this
world
be
a
very
easy
affair
to
her
.
<EOS>
of
course
all
the
rest
of
the
company
would
soon
be
down
,
and
the
opportunity
of
her
say
something
to
efface
her
flippancy
of
the
evening
before
,
would
be
quite
go
.
<EOS>
She
feel
sick
with
irritation
 
<EOS>
so
fast
do
young
creature
like
her
absorb
misery
through
invisible
sucker
of
their
own
fancy
 
and
her
face
have
gather
that
peculiar
expression
which
come
with
a
mortification
to
which
tear
be
forbid
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
he
throw
down
the
paper
and
turn
round
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
you
be
there
already
,
"
he
say
,
come
forward
a
step
or
two
:
"
I
must
go
and
put
on
my
coat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
turn
aside
and
walk
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
this
be
behave
quite
badly
.
<EOS>
mere
politeness
would
have
make
him
stay
to
exchange
some
word
before
leave
her
alone
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
Grandcourt
come
in
with
Sir
Hugo
immediately
after
,
so
that
the
word
must
have
be
too
few
to
be
worth
anything
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
they
see
him
walk
from
the
library
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
 
you
look
rather
ill
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
go
straight
up
to
her
,
stand
in
front
of
her
,
and
look
into
her
eye
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
you
feel
equal
to
the
walk
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
shall
like
it
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
without
the
slight
movement
except
this
of
the
lip
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
could
put
off
go
over
the
house
,
you
know
,
and
only
go
out
of
door
,
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
kindly
,
while
Grandcourt
turn
aside
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
dear
no
!
<EOS>
"
say
Gwendolen
,
speak
with
determination
;
"
let
us
put
off
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
want
a
long
walk
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
rest
of
the
walk
party
 
two
lady
and
two
gentleman
besides
Deronda
 
have
now
assemble
;
and
Gwendolen
rallying
,
go
with
due
cheerfulness
by
the
side
of
Sir
Hugo
,
pay
apparently
an
equal
attention
to
the
commentary
Deronda
be
call
upon
to
give
on
the
various
architectural
fragment
,
to
Sir
Hugo
's
reason
for
not
attempt
to
remedy
the
mixture
of
the
undisguised
modern
with
the
antique
 
which
in
his
opinion
only
make
the
place
the
more
truly
historical
.
<EOS>
on
their
way
to
the
buttery
<EOS>
and
kitchen
they
take
the
outside
of
the
house
and
pause
before
a
beautiful
pointed
doorway
,
which
be
the
only
old
remnant
in
the
east
front
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
now
,
to
my
mind
,
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
"
that
be
more
interesting
standing
as
it
be
in
the
middle
of
what
be
frankly
four
century
later
,
than
if
the
whole
front
have
be
dress
up
in
a
pretense
of
the
thirteenth
century
.
<EOS>
addition
ought
to
smack
of
the
time
when
they
be
make
and
carry
the
stamp
of
their
period
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
destroy
any
old
bit
,
but
that
notion
of
reproduce
the
old
be
a
mistake
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
at
least
,
if
a
man
like
to
do
it
he
must
pay
for
his
whistle
.
<EOS>
besides
,
where
be
you
to
stop
along
that
road
 
make
loophole
where
you
do
not
want
to
peep
,
and
so
on
?
<EOS>
You
may
as
well
ask
me
to
wear
out
the
stone
with
kneel
;
eh
,
Grandcourt
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
a
confound
nuisance
,
"
drawl
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
"
I
hate
fellow
want
to
howl
litany
 
<EOS>
act
the
great
bore
that
have
ever
exist
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
yes
,
that
be
what
their
romanticism
must
come
to
,
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
in
a
tone
of
confidential
assent
 
"
that
be
if
they
carry
it
out
logically
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
way
of
argue
against
a
course
because
it
may
be
ride
down
to
an
absurdity
would
soon
bring
life
to
a
standstill
,
"
say
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
the
logic
of
human
action
,
but
of
a
roast
-
jack
,
that
must
go
on
to
the
last
turn
when
it
have
be
once
wind
up
.
<EOS>
We
can
do
nothing
safely
without
some
judgment
as
to
where
we
be
to
stop
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
find
the
rule
of
the
pocket
the
good
guide
,
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
laughingly
.
"
<EOS>
and
as
for
most
of
your
new
-
old
building
,
you
have
need
to
hire
man
to
scratch
and
chip
it
all
over
artistically
to
give
it
an
elderly
-
look
surface
;
which
at
the
present
rate
of
labor
would
not
answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
want
to
keep
up
the
old
fashion
,
then
,
Mr.
Deronda
?
"
say
Gwendolen
,
take
advantage
of
the
freedom
of
group
to
fall
back
a
little
,
while
Sir
Hugo
and
Grandcourt
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
some
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
why
we
should
not
use
our
choice
there
as
we
do
elsewhere
 
or
why
either
age
or
novelty
by
itself
be
an
argument
for
or
against

<EOS>
to
delight
in
do
thing
because
our
father
do
them
be
good
if
it
shut
out
nothing
well
;
it
enlarge
the
range
of
affection
 
and
affection
be
the
broad
basis
of
good
in
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
so
?
"
say
Gwendolen
with
a
little
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
think
you
care
most
about
idea
,
knowledge
,
wisdom
,
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
to
care
about

them

be
a
sort
of
affection
,
"
say
Deronda
,
smile
at
her
sudden
_
naïveté
_
.
<EOS>
"
call
it
attachment
;
interest
,
willing
to
bear
a
great
deal
for
the
sake
of
be
with
them
and
save
them
from
injury
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
it
make
a
difference
if
the
object
of
interest
be
human
being
;
but
generally
in
all
deep
affection
the
object
be
a
mixture
 
half
person
and
half
idea
 
sentiment
and
affection
flow
in
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
I
understand
that
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
put
up
her
chin
in
her
old
saucy
manner
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
be
not
very
affectionate
;
perhaps
you
mean
to
tell
me
,
that
be
the
reason
why
I
do
not
see
much
good
in
life

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
do
_
<EOS>
not

tell
you
that
;

I
admit
that
I
should
think
it
true

I
believe
what
you
say
of
yourself

say
Deronda
,
gravely
.
  
<EOS>
here
Sir
Hugo
and
Grandcourt
turn
round
and
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
can
get
Mr.
Deronda
to
pay
me
a
compliment
,
"
say
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
quite
a
curiosity
to
see
whether
a
little
flattery
can
be
extract
from
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
glance
at
Deronda
,
"
the
fact
be
,
it
be
useless
to
flatter
a
bride
.
<EOS>
We
give
it
up
in
despair
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
so
feed
on
sweet
speech
that
every
thing
we
say
seem
tasteless

"
  
<EOS>
"
quite
true

Gwendolen

bend
her
head

<EOS>
Mr.
Grandcourt
win
me
by
neatly
-
turn
compliment

<EOS>
if
there
have
be
one
word
out
of
place
it
would
have
be
fatal

"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
hear
that
?
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
look
at
the
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
without
change
of
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
deucedly
hard
thing
to
keep
up
,
though
.
"
  
<EOS>
all
this
seem
to
Sir
Hugo
a
natural
playfulness
between
such
a
husband
and
wife
;
but
Deronda
wonder
at
the
misleading
alternation
in
Gwendolen
's
manner
,
which
at
one
moment
seem
to
excite
sympathy
by
childlike
indiscretion
,
at
another
to
repel
it
by
proud
concealment
.
<EOS>
He
try
to
keep
out
of
her
way
by
devote
himself
to
Miss
Juliet
Fenn
,
a
young
lady
whose
profile
have
be
so
unfavorably
decide
by
circumstance
over
which
she
have
no
control
,
that
Gwendolen
some
month
ago
have
feel
it
impossible
to
be
jealous
of
her
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
when
they
be
see
the
kitchen
 
a
part
of
the
original
building
in
perfect
preservation
 
the
depth
of
shadow
in
the
niche
of
the
stone
-
wall
and
groin
vault
,
the
play
of
light
from
the
huge
glowing
fire
on
polished
tin
,
brass
,
and
copper
,
the
fine
resonance
that
come
with
every
sound
of
voice
or
metal
,
be
all
spoil
for
Gwendolen
,
and
Sir
Hugo
's
speech
about
them
be
make
rather
importunate
,
because
Deronda
be
discourse
to
the
other
lady
and
keep
at
a
distance
from
her
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
signify
that
the
other
gentleman
take
the
opportunity
of
be
near
her
:
of
what
use
in
the
world
be
their
admiration
while
she
have
an
uneasy
sense
that
there
be
some
standard
in
Deronda
's
mind
which
measure
her
into
littleness
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Vandernoodt
,
who
have
the
mania
of
always
describe
one
thing
while
you
be
look
at
another
,
be
quite
intolerable
with
his
insistence
on
Lord
Blough
's
kitchen
,
which
he
have
see
in
the
north
.
  
<EOS>
"
pray
do
not
ask
us
to
see
two
kitchen
at
once

<EOS>
It
make
the
heat
double

<EOS>
I
must
really
go
out

she
cry
at
last
,
march
resolutely
into
the
open
air
,
and
leave
the
other
in
the
rear
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
be
already
out
,
and
as
she
join
him
,
he
say
    
"
I
wonder
how
long
you
mean
to
stay
in
that
damned
place
"
 
one
of
the
freedom
he
have

the
use

his
strong
epithet

<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
turn
to
see
the
rest
of
the
party
approach
,
say
    
"
It
be
certainly
rather
too
warm
in

"
  
<EOS>
They
walk
on
the
gravel
across
a
green
court
,
where

in

on

and
in

on

bough
of

then
into
a
large
court

where
there
be
another
cedar

to
find
the
beautiful
choir

ago
turn
into
stable

in
the
first
instance
perhaps
after
an
impromptu
fashion
by
trooper

who
have

pious
satisfaction
in
insult
the

<EOS>
"
oh
,
this
be
glorious
!
"
<EOS>
Gwendolen
burst
forth
,
in
forgetfulness
of
everything
<EOS>
but
the
immediate
impression
:
there
have
be
a
little
intoxication
for
her
in
the
grand
space
of
court
and
building
,
and
the
fact
of
her
be
an
important
person
among
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
_
be
_
glorious
!
<EOS>
only
I
wish
there
be
a
horse
in
every
one
of
the
box
.
<EOS>
I
would
ten
time
rather
have
these
stable
than
those
at
Diplow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
she
have
no
sooner
say
this
than
some
consciousness
arrest
her
,
and
involuntarily
she
turn
her
eye
toward
Deronda
,
who
oddly
enough
have
take
off
his
felt
hat
and
stand
hold
it
before
him
as
if
they
have
enter
a
room
or
an
actual
church
.
<EOS>
He
,
like
other
,
happen
to
be
look
at
her
,
and
their
eye
meet
 
to
her
intense
vexation
,
for
it
seem
to
her
that
by
look
at
him
she
have
betray
the
reference
of
her
thought
,
and
she
feel
herself
blush
<EOS>
:
she
exaggerate
the
impression
that
even
Sir
Hugo
as
well
as
Deronda
would
have
of
her
bad
taste
in
refer
to
the
possession
of
anything
at
the
Abbey
:
<EOS>
as
for
Deronda
,
she
have
probably
make
him
despise
her
.
<EOS>
Her
annoyance
at
what
she
imagine
to
be
the
obviousness
of
her
confusion
rob
her
of
her
usual
facility
in
carry
it
off
by
playful
speech
,
and
turn
up
her
face
to
look
at
the
roof
,
she
wheel
away
in
that
attitude
.
<EOS>
if
any
have
notice
her
blush
as
significant
,
they
have
certainly
not
interpret
it
by
the
secret
winding
and
recess
of
her
feeling
.
<EOS>
a
blush
be
no
language
:
only
a
dubious
flag
-
signal
which
may
mean
either
of
two
contradictory
.
<EOS>
Deronda
alone
have
a
faint
guess
at
some
part
of
her
feeling
;
but
while
he
be
observe
her
he
be
himself
under
observation
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
take
off
your
hat
to
horse
?
<EOS>
"
say
Grandcourt
,
with
a
slight
sneer
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
not
?
"
say
Deronda
,
cover
himself
.
<EOS>
He
have
really
take
off
the
hat
automatically
,
and
if
he
have
be
an
ugly
man
may
doubtless
have
do
so
with
impunity
;
ugliness
have
naturally
the
air
of
involuntary
exposure
,
and
beauty
,
of
display
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
confusion
be
soon
merge
in
the
survey
of
the
horse
,
which
Grandcourt
politely
abstain
from
appraise
,
languidly
assent
to
Sir
Hugo
's
alternate
depreciation
and
eulogy
of
the
same
animal
,
as
one
that
he
should
not
have
buy
when
he
be
young
,
and
pique
himself
on
his
horse
,
but
yet
one
that
have
well
quality
than
many
more
expensive
brute
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
fact
be
,
stable
dive
deep
and
deep
into
the
pocket
nowadays
,
and
I
be
very
glad
to
have
get
rid
of
that
_
démangeaison
_
,
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
as
they
be
come
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
a
man
to
do
,
though
?
"
say
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
"
He
must
ride
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
what
else
there
be
to
do
.
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
call
it
ride
to
sit
astride
a
set
of
brute
with
every
deformity
under
the
sun
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
delicate
diplomatic
way
of
characterize
Sir
Hugo
's
stud
do
not
require
direct
notice
;
and
the
baronet
,
feel
that
the
conversation
have
wear
rather
thin
,
say
to
the
party
generally
,
"
now
we
be
go
to
see
the
cloister
 
<EOS>
the
fine
bit
of
all
 
in
perfect
preservation
;
the
monk
may
have
be
walk
there
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
Gwendolen
have
linger
behind
to
look
at
the
kenneled
blood
-
hound
,
perhaps
because
she
feel
a
little
dispirited
;
and
Grandcourt
wait
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
take
my
arm
,
"
he
say
,
in
his
low
tone
of
command
;
and
she
take
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
great
bore
be
drag
about
in
this
way
,
and
no
cigar
,
"
say
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
would
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
like
it
!
 
<EOS>
one
eternal
chatter

<EOS>
and
encourage
those
ugly

invite
one
to
meet
such
monster
.
<EOS>
how
that
_
fat

Deronda
can
bear
look
at
her
   
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
call
him

<EOS>
do
you
object

no

It

<EOS>
I

diplow
again
if
you
like

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
he
would
come
.
<EOS>
He
be
too
clever
and
learn
to
care
about
_
us
_
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
think
it
useful
for
her
husband
to
be
tell
(
privately
)
that
it
be
possible
for
him
to
be
look
down
upon
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never

that
make
much
difference
in

<EOS>
either
he

a
gentleman

or
he

not

"
say
Grandcourt

<EOS>
that
a

and

should
snatch
,
a
moment

_
tete

tete

what
could
be
understand

indulge

and
the
rest
of
the
party
leave
them
in
the
rear
till
,
re
-
enter
the
garden
,
they
all
pause
in
that
cloister
court
where
,
among
the
fall
rise
-
petal
thirteen
year
before
,
we
see
a
boy
become
acquaint
with
his
first
sorrow
.
<EOS>
this
cloister
be
build
of
a
hard
stone
than
the
church
,
and
have
be
in
great
safety
from
the
wear
weather
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
rare
example
of
a
northern
cloister
with
arched
and
pillard
opening
not
intend
for
glazing
,
and
the
delicately
-
wrought
foliage
of
the
capital
seem
still
to
carry
the
very
touch
of
the
chisel
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
have
drop
her
husband
's
arm
and
join
the
other
lady
,
to
whom
Deronda
be
notice
the
delicate
sense
which
have
combine
freedom
with
accuracy
in
the
imitation
of
natural
form
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
one
oftener
learn
to
love
real
object
through
their
representation
,
or
the
representation
through
the
real
object
,
"
he
say
,
after
point
out
a
lovely
capital
make
by
the
curled
leave
of
green
,
show
their
reticulate
under

side
with
the
firm
gradual
swell
of
its
central
rib
.
<EOS>
"
when
I
be
a
little
fellow
these
capital
teach
me
to
observe
and
delight
in
the
structure
of
leave

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
can
see
every

them
with
your
eye
shut

"
say
Juliet
Fenn
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
I
be
always
repeat
them
,
because
for
a
good
many
year
this
court
stand
for
me
as
my
only
image
of
a
convent
,
and
whenever
I
read
of
monk
and
monastery
,
this
be
my
scenery
for
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
love
this
place
very
much
,
"
say
Miss
Fenn
,
innocently
,
not
think
of
inheritance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
many
home
be
like
twenty
other

<EOS>
but
this
be
unique
,
and
you
seem
to
know
every
cranny
of
it

<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
could
never

another
home
so
well

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
carry
it
with
me
,
"
say
Deronda
,
quietly
,
be
use
to
all
possible
thought
of
this
kind

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
to
most
man
their
early
home
be
no
more
than
a
memory
of
their
early
year

I
be
not
sure
<EOS>
but
they
have
the
good
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
image
be
never

<EOS>
there
be
no
disappointment
in
memory
,
and
one
's
exaggeration
be
always
on
the
good
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
feel
sure
that
he
speak
in
that
way
out
of
delicacy
to
her
and
Grandcourt
 
because
he
know
they
must
hear
him
;
and
that
he
probably
think
of
her
as
a
selfish
creature
who
only
care
about
possess
thing
in
her
own
person
.
<EOS>
but
whatever
he
may
say
,
it
must
have
be
a
secret
hardship
to
him
that
any
circumstance
of
his
birth
have
shut
him
out
from
the
inheritance
of
his
father
's
position
;
and
if
he
suppose
that
she
exult
in
her
husband
's
<EOS>
take
it
,
what
could
he
feel
for
her
but
scornful
pity
?
<EOS>
indeed
it
seem
clear
to
her
that
he
be
avoid
her
,
and
prefer
talk
to
other
 
which
nevertheless
be
not
kind
in
him
.
  
<EOS>
with
these
thought
in
her
mind
she
be
prevent
by
a
mixture
of
pride
and
timidity
from
address
him
again
,
and
when
they
be
look
at
the
row
of
quaint
portrait
in
the
gallery
above
the
cloister
,
she
keep
up
her
air
of
interest
and
make
her
vivacious
remark
without
any
direct
appeal
to
Deronda
.
<EOS>
but
at
the
end
she
be
very
weary
of
her
assumed
spirit
,
and
Grandcourt
turn
into
the
billiard
-
room
<EOS>
,
she
go
to
the
pretty
boudoir
which
have
be
assign
to
her
,
and
shut
herself
up
to
look
melancholy
at
her
ease
.
<EOS>
no
chemical
process
show
a
more
wonderful
activity
than
the
transforming
influence
of
the
thought
we
imagine
to
be
go
on
in
another
.
<EOS>
change
in
theory
,
religion
,
admiration
,
may
begin
with
a
suspicion
of
dissent
or
disapproval
,
even
when
the
ground
of
disapproval
be
but
matter
of
search
conjecture
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Gwendolen
be
conscious
of
an
uneasy
,
transform
process
 
all
the
old
nature
shake
to
its
depth
,
its
hope
spoil
,
its
pleasure
perturbed
,
but
still
show
wholeness
and
strength
in
the
will
to
reassert
itself
.
<EOS>
after
every
new
shock
of
humiliation
she
try
to
adjust
herself
and
seize
her
old
support
 
proud
concealment
,
trust
in
new
excitement
that
would
make
life
go
by
without
much
thinking
;
trust
in
some
deed
of
reparation
to
nullify
her
self
-
blame
and
shield
her
from
a
vague
,
ever
-
visit
dread
of
some
horrible
calamity
;
trust
in
the
hardening
effect
of
use
and
will
not
that
would
make
her
indifferent
to
her
misery
.
  
<EOS>
yes
 
misery
.
<EOS>
this
beautiful
,
healthy
young
creature
,
with
her
two
-
and
-
twenty
year
and
her
gratified
ambition
,
no
longer
feel
inclined
to
kiss
her
fortunate
image
in
the
glass

<EOS>
She
look
at
it
with
wonder
that
she
could
be
so
miserable
.
<EOS>
one
belief
which
have
accompany
her
through
her
unmarried
life
as
a
self
-
cajole
superstition
,
encourage
by
the
subordination
of
every
one
about
her
 
the
belief
in
her
own
power
of
dominate
 
be
utterly
go
.
<EOS>
already
,
in
seven
short
week
,
which
seem
half
her
life
,
her
husband
have
gain
a
mastery
which
she
could
no
more
resist
than
she
could
have
resist
the
benumb
effect
from
the
touch
of
a
torpedo
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
will
have
seem
imperious
in
its
small
girlish
sway
;
but
it
be
the
will
of
a
creature
with
a
large
discourse
of
imaginative
fear
:
a
shadow
would
have
be
enough
to
relax
its
hold
.
<EOS>
and
she
have
find
a
will
like
that
of
a
crab
or
a
boa
-
constrictor
,
which
go
on
pinch
or
crush
without
alarm
at
thunder
.
<EOS>
not
that
Grandcourt
be
without
calculation
of
the
intangible
effect
which
be
the
chief
mean
of
mastery
;
indeed
,
he
have
a
surprising
acuteness
in
detect
that
situation
of
feeling
in
Gwendolen
which
make
her
proud
and
rebellious
spirit
dumb
and
helpless
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
burn
Lydia
Glasher
's
letter
with
an
instantaneous
terror
lest
other
eye
should
see
it
,
and
have
tenaciously
conceal
from
Grandcourt
that
there
be
any
other
cause
of
her
violent
hysteric
than
the
excitement
and
fatigue
of
the
day
:
she
have

into
an
implied
falsehood

<EOS>
"
do

me
 
it

my
feeling

it

the
word

that

at
last
,
if
you
have
not
break
your
word
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
your
punishment
.
<EOS>
I
desire
it
with
all
my
soul
.
<EOS>
Will
you
give
him
this
letter
to
set
him
against
me
and
ruin
us
more
 
me
and
my
child
?
<EOS>
Shall
you
like
to
stand
before
your
husband
with
these
diamond
on
you
,
and
these
word
of
mine
in
his
thought
and
yours
?
<EOS>
Will
he
think
you
have
any
right
to
complain
when
he
have
make
you
miserable
?
<EOS>
You
take
him
with
your
eye
open
.
<EOS>
the
willing
wrong
you
have
do
me
will
be
your
curse
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
word
have
nestle
their
venomous
life
within
her
,
and
stir
continually
the
vision
of
the
scene
at
the
Whispering
Stones
.
<EOS>
that
scene
be
now
like
an
accuse
apparition
:
she
dread
that
Grandcourt
should
know
of
it
 
so
far
out
of
her
sight
<EOS>
now
be
that
possibility
she
have
once
satisfy
herself
with
,
of
speak
to
him
about
Mrs.
Glasher
and
her
child
,
and
make
them
rich
amend
.
<EOS>
any
endurance
seem
easy
than
the
mortal
humiliation
of
confess
that
she
know
all
before
she
marry
him
,
and
in
marry
him
have
break
her
word
.
<EOS>
for
the
reason
by
which
she
have
justify
herself
when
the
marriage
tempt
her
,
and
all
her
easy
arrangement
of
her
future
power
over
her
husband
to
make
him
do
better
than
he
may
be
incline
to
do
,
be
now
as
futile
as
the
burn
-
out
light
which
set
off
a
child
's
pageant
.
<EOS>
Her
sense
of
be
blameworthy
be
exaggerate
by
a
dread
both
definite
and
vague
.
<EOS>
the
definite
dread
be
lest
the
veil
of
secrecy
should
fall
between
her
and
Grandcourt
,
and
give
him
the
right
to
taunt
her
.
<EOS>
with
the
reading
of
that
letter
have
begin
her
husband
's
empire
of
fear
.
  
<EOS>
and
her
husband
all
the
while
know
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
,
indeed
,
any
distinct
knowledge
of
her
broken
promise
,
and
would
not
have
rate
highly
the
effect
of
that
breach
on
her
conscience
;
but
he
be
aware
not
only
of
what
Lush
have
tell
him
about
the
meeting
at
the
Whispering
Stones
,
but
also
of
Gwendolen
's
concealment
as
to
the
cause
of
her
sudden
illness
.
<EOS>
He
feel
sure
that
Lydia
have
enclose
something
with
the
diamond
,
and
that
this
something
,
whatever
it
be
,
have
at
once
create
in
Gwendolen
a
new
repulsion
for
him
and
a
reason
for
not
daring
to
manifest
it
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
greatly
mind
,
or
feel
as
many
man
may
have
feel
,
that
his
hope
in
marriage
be
blight
:
he
have
want
to
marry
Gwendolen
,
and
he
be
not
a
man
to
repent
.
<EOS>
why
should
a
gentleman
whose
other
relation
in
life
be
carry
on
without
the
luxury
of
sympathetic
feeling
,
be
suppose
to
require
that
kind
of
condiment
in
domestic
life
?
<EOS>
what
he
chiefly
feel
be
that
a
change
have
come
over
the
condition
of
his
mastery
,
which
,
far
from
shake
it
,
may
establish
it
the
more
thoroughly
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
establish
.
<EOS>
He
judge
that
he
have
not
marry
a
simpleton
unable
to
perceive
the
impossibility
of
escape
,
or
to
see
alternative
evil
:
he
have
marry
a
girl
who
have
spirit
and
pride
enough
not
to
make
a
fool
of
herself
by
forfeit
all
the
advantage
of
a
position
which
have
attract
her
;
and
if
she
want
pregnant
hint
to
help
her
in
make
up
her
mind
properly
he
would
take
care
not
to
withhold
them
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
indeed
,
with
all
that
gnaw
trouble
in
her
consciousness
,
have
hardly
for
a
moment
drop
the
sense
that
it
be
her
part
to
bear
herself
with
dignity
,
and
appear
what
be
call
happy
.
<EOS>
in
disclosure
of
disappointment
or
sorrow
she
see
nothing
but
a
humiliation
which
would
have
be
vinegar
to
her
wound
.
<EOS>
whatever
her
husband
may
have
come
at
last
to
be
to
her
,
she
mean
to
wear
the
yoke
so
as
not
to
be
pity
.
<EOS>
for
she
do
think
of
the
come
year
with
presentiment
:
she
be
frightened
at
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
the
poor
thing
have
pass
from
her
girlish
sauciness
of
superiority
over
this
inert
speciman
of
personal
distinction
into
an
amazed
perception
of
her
former
ignorance
about
the
possible
mental
attitude
of
a
man
toward
the
woman
he
seek
in
marriage
 
of
her
present
ignorance
as
to
what
their
life
with
each
other
may
turn
into
.
<EOS>
for
novelty
give
immeasurableness
to
fear
,
and
fill
the
early
time
of
all
sad
change
with
phantom
of
the
future
.
<EOS>
Her
little
coquetry
,
voluntary
or
involuntary
,
have
tell
on
Grandcourt
during
courtship
,
and
form
a
medium
of
communication
between
them
,
show
him
in
the
light
of
a
creature
such
as
she
could
understand
and
manage
:
<EOS>
but
marriage
have
nulifie
all
such
interchange
,
and
Grandcourt
have
become
a
blank
uncertainty
to
her
in
everything
<EOS>
but
this
,
that
he
would
do
just
what
he
will
,
and
that
she
have
neither
device
at
her
command
to
determine
his
will
,
nor
any
rational
mean
of
escape
it
.
  
<EOS>
what
have
occur
between
them
and
her
wear
the
diamond
be
typical
.
<EOS>
one
evening
,
shortly
before
they
come
to
the
Abbey
,
they
be
go
to
dine
at
Brackenshaw
Castle
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
have
say
to
herself
that
she
would
never
wear
those
diamond
:
they
have
horrible
word
cling
and
crawl
about
them
,
as
from
some
bad
dream
,
whose
image
linger
on
the
perturbed
sense
.
<EOS>
She
come
down
dressed
in
her
white
,
with
only
a
streak
of
gold
and
a
pendant
of
emerald
,
which
Grandcourt
have
give
her
,
round
her
neck
,
and
the
little
emerald
star
in
her
ear
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
stand
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
look
at
her
as
she
enter
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
I
altogether
as
you
like
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
speak
rather
gaily
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
without
enjoyment
in
this
occasion
of
go
to
Brackenshaw
Castle
with
her
new
dignity
upon
her
,
as
man
whose
affair
be
sadly
involved
will
enjoy
dine
out
among
person
likely
to
be
under
a
pleasant
mistake
about
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
feel
suddenly
uncomfortable
,
wonder
what
be
to
come
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
unprepared
for
some
struggle
about
the
diamond
;
but
suppose
he
be
go
to
say
,
in
low
,
contemptuous
tone
,
"
You
be
not
in
any
way
what
I
like
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
bad
for
her
to
be
secretly
hate
him
;
but
it
would
be
much
bad
when
he
give
the
first
sign
of
hate
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
mercy
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaim
,
the
pause
last
till
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
.
"
<EOS>
how
be
I
to
alter
myself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
put
on
the
diamond
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
look
straight
at
her
with
his
narrow
glance
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
pause
in
her
turn
,
afraid
of
show
any
emotion
,
and
feeling
that
nevertheless
there
be
some
change
in
her
eye
as
they
meet
his
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
oblige
to
answer
,
and
say
as
indifferently
as
she
could
,
"
oh
,
please
not
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
diamond
suit
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
you
think
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
his
_
sotto
voce
_
imperiousness
seem
to
have
an
evening
quietude
and
finish
,
like
his
toilet
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
to
wear
the
diamond
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
pray
excuse
me
;
I
like
these
emerald
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
frighten
in
spite
of
her
preparation
.
<EOS>
that
white
hand
of
his
which
be
touch
his
whisker
be
capable
,
she
fancy
,
of
cling
round
her
neck
and
threaten
to
throttle
her
;
for
her
fear
of
him
,
mingle
with
the
vague
foreboding
of
some
retributive
calamity
which
hang
about
her
life
,
have
reach
a
superstitious
point
.
  
<EOS>
"
oblige
me
by
tell
me
your
reason
for
not
wear
the
diamond
when
I
desire
it
,
"
say
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
His
eye
be
still
fix
upon
her
,
and
she
feel
her
own
eye
narrow
under
them
as
if
to
shut
out
an
enter
pain
.
  
<EOS>
of
what
use
be
the
rebellion
within
her
?
<EOS>
She
could
say
nothing
that
would
not
hurt
her
bad
than
submission
.
<EOS>
turn
slow
and
cover
herself
again
,
she
go
to
her
dressing
-
room
.
<EOS>
as
she
reach
out
the
diamond
it
occur
to
her
that
her
unwillingness
to
wear
them
may
have
already
raise
a
suspicion
in
Grandcourt
that
she
have
some
knowledge
about
them
which
he
have
not
give
her
.
<EOS>
She
fancy
that
his
eye
show
a
delight
in
torture
her
.
<EOS>
how
could
she
be
defiant
?
<EOS>
She
have
nothing
to
say
that
would
touch
him
 
nothing
but
what
would
give
him
a
more
painful
grasp
on
her
consciousness
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
delight
in
make
the
dog
and
horse
quail
:
<EOS>
that
be
half
his
pleasure
in
call
them
his
,
"
she
say
to
herself
,
as
she
open
the
jewel
-
case
with
a
shivering
sensation
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
come
to
be
so
with
me
;
and
I
shall
quail
.
<EOS>
what
else
be
there
for
me
?
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
to
the
world
,
"
pity
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
about
to
ring
for
her
maid
when
she
hear
the
door
open
behind
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
Grandcourt
who
come
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
want
some
one
to
fasten
them
,
"
he
say
,
come
toward
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
do
not
answer
,
but
simply
stand
still
,
leave
him
to
take
out
the
ornament
and
fasten
them
as
he
would
.
<EOS>
doubtless
he
have
be
use
to
fasten
them
on
some
one
else
.
<EOS>
with
a
bitter
sort
of
sarcasm
against
herself
,
Gwendolen
think
,
"
what
a
privilege
this
be
,
to
have
rob
another
woman
of
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
make
you
so
cold
?
"
say
Grandcourt
,
when
he
have
fasten
the
last
ear
-
ring
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
pray
put
plenty
of
fur
on
.
<EOS>
I
hate
to
see
a
woman
come
into
a
room
look
frozen
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
to
appear
as
a
bride
at
all
,
appear
decently
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
martial
speech
be
not
exactly
persuasive
,
but
it
touch
the
quick
of
Gwendolen
's
pride
and
force
her
to
rally
.
<EOS>
the
word
of
the
bad
dream
crawl
about
the
diamond
still
,
but
only
for
her
:
to
other
they
be
brilliant
that
suit
her
perfectly
,
and
Grandcourt
inwardly
observe
that
she
answer
to
the
rein
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
mamma
,
quite
happy
<EOS>
,
"
Gwendolen
have
say
on
her
return
to
Diplow
.
"
not
at
all
disappoint
in
ryeland
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
much
fine
place
than
this
 
large
in
every
way
.
<EOS>
but
do
not
you
want
some
more
money
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
not
know
that
Mr.
Grandcourt
leave
me
a
letter
on
your
wedding
-
day
?
<EOS>
I
be
to
have
eight
hundred
a
year
.
<EOS>
He
wish
me
to
keep
Offendene
for
the
present
,
while
you
be
at
Diplow
.
<EOS>
but
if
there
be
some
pretty
cottage
near
the
park
at
Ryelands
we
may
live
there
without
much
expense
,
and
I
should
have
you
most
of
the
year
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
leave
that
to
Mr.
Grandcourt
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
It
be
exceedingly
handsome
of
him
to
say
that
he
will
pay
the
rent
for
Offendene
till
June
.
<EOS>
and
we
can
go
on
very
well
 
without
any
man
-
servant
except
Crane
,
just
for
out
-
of
-
door
.
<EOS>
Our
good
Merry
will
stay
with
us
and
help
me
to
manage
everything
.
<EOS>
It
be
natural
that
Mr.
Grandcourt
should
wish
me
to
live
in
a
good
style
of
house
in
your
neighborhood
,
and
I
can
not
decline
.
<EOS>
so
he
say
nothing
about
it
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
he
wish
me
to
hear
it
from
you
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
in
fact
have
be
very
anxious
to
have
some
definite
knowledge
of
what
would
be
do
for
her
mother
,
but
at
no
moment
since
her
marriage
have
she
be
able
to
overcome
the
difficulty
of
mention
the
subject
to
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
she
have
a
sense
of
obligation
which
would
not
let
her
rest
without
say
to
him
,
"
It
be
very
good
of
you
to
provide
for
mamma
.
<EOS>
You
take
a
great
deal
on
yourself
in
marry
a
girl
who
have
nothing
but
relation
belong
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
be
smoke
,
and
only
say
carelessly
,
"
of
course
I
be
not
go
to
let
her
live
like
a
gamekeeper
's
mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
at
least
he
be
not
mean
about
money
,
"
think
Gwendolen
,
"
and
mamma
be
the
well
off
for
my
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
often
pursue
the
comparison
between
what
may
have
be
,
if
she
have
not
marry
Grandcourt
,
and
what
actually
be
,
try
to
persuade
herself
that
life
generally
be
barren
of
satisfaction
,
and
that
if
she
have
choose
differently
she
may
now
have
be
look
back
with
a
regret
as
bitter
as
the
feeling
she
be
try
to
argue
away
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
's
dullness
,
which
use
to
irritate
her
,
she
be
at
present
inclined
to
explain
as
the
ordinary
result
of
woman
's
experience
.
<EOS>
true
,
she
still
see
that
she
would
"
manage
differently
from
mamma
;
"
but
her
management
now
only
mean
that
she
would
carry
her
trouble
with
spirit
,
and
let
none
suspect
them
.
<EOS>
by
and
by
she
promise
herself
that
she
should
get
used
to
her
heart
-
sore
,
and
find
excitement
that
would
carry
her
through
life
,
as
a
hard
gallop
carry
her
through
some
of
the
morning
hour
.
<EOS>
there
be
gambling
:
she
have
hear
story
at
Leubronn
of
fashionable
woman
who
gamble
in
all
sort
of
way
.
<EOS>
It
seem
very
flat
to
her
at
this
distance
,
but
perhaps
if
she
begin
to
gamble
again
,
the
passion
may

<EOS>
then
there
be
the
pleasure
of
produce

appearance
in

<EOS>
what
do
celebrated
beauty
do
in
town
when
their
husband
could
afford
display
?
<EOS>
all
man
be
fascinate
by
them
:
they
have
a
perfect
equipage
and
toilet
,
walk
into
public
place
,
and
bow
,
and
make
the
usual
answer
,
and
walk
out
again
,
perhaps
they
buy
china
,
and
practice
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
if
she
could
only
feel
a
keen
appetite
for
those
pleasure
 
could
only
believe
in
pleasure
as
she
use
to
do

<EOS>
accomplishment
have
cease
to
have
the
exciting
quality
of
promise
any

to

and
as
for
fascinated
gentleman
 
adorer
who
may
hover
round
her
with
languishment
,
and
diversify
married
life
with
the
romantic
stir
of
mystery
,
passion
,
and
danger
,
which
her
french
reading
have
give
her
some
girlish
notion
of
 
they
present
themselves
to
her
imagination
with
the
fatal
circumstance
that
,
instead
of
fascinate
her
in

,
they
be
clothe
in
her

weariness
and
disgust
.
<EOS>
the

,
rashly
adjust
the
expression
of
his

and
the
turn
of
his
conversation
to
her
suppose
taste
,
have
always
be
an
absurd
object
to
her
,
and
at
present
seem
rather
detestable
.
<EOS>
many
course
be
actually
pursue
 
folly
and
sin
both
convenient
and
inconvenient
 
without
pleasure
or
hope
of
pleasure
;
but
to
solace
ourselves
with
imagine
any
course
beforehand
,
there
must
be
some
foretaste
of
pleasure
in
the
shape
of
appetite
;
and
Gwendolen
's
appetite
have
sicken
.
<EOS>
let
her
wander
over
the
possibility
of
her
life
as
she
would
,
an
uncertain
shadow
dog
her
.
<EOS>
Her
confidence
in
herself
and
her
destiny
have
turn
into
remorse
and
dread
;
she
trust
neither
herself
nor
her
future
.
  
<EOS>
this
hide
helplessness
give
fresh
force
to
the
hold
Deronda
have
from
the
first
take
on
her
mind
,
as
one
who
have
an
unknown
standard
by
which
he
judge
her
.
<EOS>
have
he
some
way
of
look
at
thing
which
may
be
a
new
footing
for
her
 
an
inward
safeguard
against
possible
event
which
she
dread
as
store
-
up
retribution
?
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
the
secret
in
that
change
of
mental
poise
which
have
be
fitly
name
conversion
,
that
to
many
among
us
<EOS>
neither
heaven
nor
earth
have
any
revelation
till
some
personality
touch
theirs
with
a
peculiar
influence
,
subdue
them
into
receptiveness
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
Gwendolen
's
habit
to
think
of
the
person
around
her
as
stale
book
,
too
familiar
to
be
interesting
.
<EOS>
Deronda
have
light
up
her
attention
with
a
sense
of
novelty
:
not
by
word
only
,
but
by
imagine
fact
,
his
influence
have
enter
into
the
current
of
that
self
-
suspicion
and
self
-
blame
which
awaken
a
new
consciousness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
he
could
know
everything
about
me
without

him

be
one
of
her
thought
,
as
she
sit
lean
over
the
end
of
a

,
support
her
head
with
her
hand
,
and
look
at
herself
in

in
a
sad
kind
of
companionship

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
"
without
the
aid
of
sacred
ceremony
or
costume
,
her
feeling
have
turn
this
man
,
only
a
few
year
old
than

into
a
priest
;
a
sort
of

less
rare
than
the

that
guard
it

<EOS>
young
reverence
for
one
who
be
also
young
be
the
most
coercive
of
all

there
be
the

level
of
temptation
,
and
the
high
motive
be
believe
in
as
a
full
force
 
not
suspect
to
be
a
mere
residue
from
weary
experience

the
coercion

often
strong
on
the
one
who
take
the
reverence

<EOS>
those

for

breed
a

I

how
he
come
to

he
must

hint

out

by

it
be

a

may
make
up

really

to
feel

curiosity

he
foresee
that
he
should
hear
what
Mr.

have
to
tell
,
without
the
condescension

Lush
would
not
altogether
own

it

course

He
be
a
confident

go

between
of
Grandcourt

<EOS>
but
I
have
it
on
the
good
authority
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
there
be
another
lady
with
four
child
at
Gadsmere

<EOS>
She
have
have
the
upper
hand
of
him
these
ten

more
,

by
what
I
can
understand
have
it
still
 
leave
her
husband
for
him
,
and
use
to
travel
with
him
everywhere
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
's
dead
now
;
I
find
a
fellow
who
be
in

know
this
Mrs.

<EOS>
a
fiery
dark

eyed
woman
 
a
noted
beauty
at
that
time
 
<EOS>
he
think
she
be
dead

<EOS>
They
say
she
have
Grandcourt
under
her
thumb
still
,
and
it
be
a
wonder
he
do
not
marry
her
,
<EOS>
for
there
be
a
very
fine
boy
,
and
I
understand
Grandcourt
can
do
absolutely
as
he
please
with
the
estate
.
<EOS>
Lush
tell
me
as
much
as
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
right
have
he
to
marry
this

"
say
Deronda

with
disgust

<EOS>
Mr.

,
adjust
the
end

shrug
his

put
out
his

<EOS>
"
_
She

can
know
nothing

Deronda

emphatically
.
<EOS>
but
that
positive
statement
be
immediately
follow
by
an
inward
query
 
<EOS>
"
Could
she
have
know
anything
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
rather
a
piquant
picture

"
say
Mr.

<EOS>
"
Grandcourt
between
two
fiery
woman
.
<EOS>
for
depend
upon
it
this
light
-
haired
one
have
plenty
of
devil
in
her
.
<EOS>
I
form
that
opinion
of
her
at
Leubronn
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
sort
of
Medea
and
Creüsa
business
.
<EOS>
fancy
the
two
meeting
!
<EOS>
Grandcourt
be
a
new
kind
of
Jason
:
I
wonder
what
sort
of
a
part
he
will
make
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
dog
's
part
at
best
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
hear
Ristori
now
,
say
,
"
Jasone
!
<EOS>
Jasone
!
"
<EOS>
these
fine
woman
generally
get
hold
of
a
stick

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Grandcourt
can
bite

I
fancy
,
"

Deronda

<EOS>
"
He
be
no
stick

"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
;
I
mean
Jason
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
quite
make
out
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
a
keen
fellow
enough
 
uncommonly
well
build
too
.
<EOS>
and
if
he
come
into
all
this
property
,
the
estate
will
bear
divide
.
<EOS>
this
girl
,
whose
friend
have
come
to
beggary
,
I
understand
,
may
think
herself
lucky
to
get
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
to
be
hard
on
a
man
because
he
get
involve
in
an
affair
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
but
he
may
make
himself
more
agreeable
.
<EOS>
I
be
tell
him
a
capital
story
last
night
,
and
he
get
up
and
walk
away
in
the
middle
.
<EOS>
I
feel
inclined
to
kick
him
.
<EOS>
do
you
suppose
that
be
inattention
or
insolence
,
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
a
mixture
.
<EOS>
He
generally
observe
the
form
:
but
he
do
not
listen
much
,
"
say
Deronda
.
<EOS>
then
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
he
go
on
,
"
I
should
think
there
must
be
some
exaggeration
or
inaccuracy
in
what
you
have
hear
about
this
lady
at
Gadsmere

<EOS>
"
  
"
not
a
bit
,
depend
upon
it
;
it
have
all
lain
snug
of
late
year

People
have
forget
all
about
it

<EOS>
but
there
the
nest
be
,
and
the
bird
be
in
it

<EOS>
and
I
know
Grandcourt
go
there
.
<EOS>
I
have
good
evidence
that
he
go
there
.
<EOS>
however
,
that
be
nobody
's
business
but
his
own
.
<EOS>
the
affair
have
sink
below
the
surface

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
you
could
have
learn
so
much
about
it

say
Deronda
,
rather
drily
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
there
be
plenty
of
people
who
know
all
about

but
such
story
get
pack
away
like
old
letter

<EOS>
They
interest
me
.
<EOS>
I
like
to
know
the
manner
of
my
time
 
contemporary
gossip

not
antediluvian

<EOS>
these
Dryasdust
fellow
get
a
reputation
by
rake
up
some
small
scandal
about
Semiramis
or
Nitocris
,
and
then
we
have
a
thousand
and
one
poem
write
upon
it
by
all
the
warbler
big
and
little

but
I
do
not

a

about
the

of

do

<EOS>
You
be
one
of
the
historical

more
interested

a

face

peep
out

do
that
flatter
your
imagination

<EOS>
"
well
,
if
she
have
any
woe
in
her
love

one
have
the
satisfaction
of
know
that
she
be
well
out
of
them

"
ah
,
you
be
think
of
the
Medea

I
see

<EOS>
Deronda
then
choose
to
point
to
some
giant
oak
worth
look
at
in
their
bareness
.
<EOS>
He
also
feel
an
interest
in
this
piece
of
contemporary
gossip
,
but
he
be
satisfied
that
Mr.
Vandernoodt
have
no
more
to
tell
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
since
the
early
day
when
he
try
to
construct
the
hide
story
of
his
own
birth
,
his
mind
have
perhaps
never
be
so
active
in
weaving
probability
about
any
private
affair
as
it
have
now
begin
to
be
about
Gwendolen
's
marriage
.
<EOS>
this
unavowed
relation
of
Grandcourt
's
 
could
she
have
gain
some
knowledge
of
it
,
which
cause
her
to
shrink
from
the
match
 
<EOS>
a
shrinking
finally
overcome
by
the
urgence
of
poverty
?
<EOS>
He
could
recall
almost
every
word
she
have
say
to
him
,
and
in
certain
of
these
word
he
seem
to
discern
that
she
be
conscious
of
have
do
some
wrong
 
inflict
some
injury
.
<EOS>
His
own
acute
experience
make
him
alive
to
the
form
of
injury
which
may
affect
the
unavowed
child
and
their
mother
.
<EOS>
be
Mrs.
Grandcourt
,
under
all
her
determined
show
of
satisfaction
,
gnaw
by
a
double
,
a
treble
-
head
grief
 
self
-
reproach
,
disappointment
,
<EOS>
jealousy
?
<EOS>
He
dwell
especially
on
all
the
slight
sign
of
self
-
reproach
:
he
be
incline
to
judge
her
tenderly
,
to
excuse
,
to
pity
.
<EOS>
He
think
he
have
find
a
key
now
by
which
to
interpret
her
more
clearly
:
what
magnifying
of
her
misery
may
not
a
young
creature
get
into
who
have
wed
her
fresh
hope
to
old
secret
!
<EOS>
He
think
he
see
clearly
enough
now
why
Sir
Hugo
have
never
drop
any
hint
of
this
affair
to
him
;
and
immediately
the
image
of
this
Mrs.
Glasher
become
painfully
associate
with
his
own
hidden
birth
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
knowing
of
that
woman
and
her
child
,
marry
Grandcourt
,
and
show
herself
content
,
would
have
be
among
the
most
repulsive
of
being
to
him
;
but
Gwendolen
taste
the
bitterness
of
remorse
for
have
contribute
to
their
injury
be
bring
very
near
to
his
fellow
-
feeling
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
so
,
she
have
get
to
a
common
plane
of
understanding
with
him
on
some
difficulty
of
life
which
a
woman
be
rarely
able
to
judge
of
with
any
justice
or
generosity
;
for
,
accord
to
precedent
,
Gwendolen
's
view
of
her
position
may
easily
have
be
no
other
than
that
her
husband
's
marriage
with
her
be
his
entrance
on
the
path
of
virtue
,
while
Mrs.
Glasher
represent
his
forsaken
sin
.
<EOS>
and
Deronda
have
naturally
some
resentment
on
behalf
of
the
Hagars
and
Ishmaels
.
  
<EOS>
undeniably
Deronda
's
grow
solicitude
about
Gwendolen
depend
chiefly
on
her
peculiar
manner
toward
him
;
and
I
suppose
neither
man
nor
woman
would
be
the
well
for
an
utter
insensibility
to
such
appeal
.
<EOS>
one
sign
that
his
interest
in
her
have
change
its
footing
be
that
he
dismiss
any
caution
against
her
be
a
coquette
set

him
in
a
vulgar
flirtation

again

her

He
have
shake
off
Mr.
Vandernoodt
,

get
into
a
solitary
corner
in
the
twilight

half
an
hour
be
long
enough

of
those

Gwendolen

state
of

on
form
the
determination
not

remember
that
she

likely
to
be
at
tea
with
the
other
lady
in

room

the
conjecture

true

for
Gwendolen

after
resolve
not

down
again
for
the

four

begin
to

at
the
end

one

herself
up
she
miss
all
chance
of
seeing

hear

that
her
visit
would
only
last
two
day
more

<EOS>
She
adjust
herself
,
put
on
her
little
air
of
self
-
possession
,
and
go
down
,
make
herself
resolutely
agreeable

<EOS>
only

Lady
Pentreath

amuse
them
with
a
description
of
a

the
figure

acceptable

I

better

happen

to
Lady
Pentreath

"
She
be
live

She

there

be
her
lesson

expensive

those

<EOS>
Her
singing
be
something
quite
exceptional

I
think
.
<EOS>
She
have
have
such
first

rate
teaching
 
or
rather
first

rate
instinct
with
her
teaching

you
may
imagine

all
come

Her

You

up

enchant
with

Deronda

look
at
Mrs.
Raymond

I
imagine
she
would
not

be
quite
equal
to
that

I

<EOS>
Lady

who

rather
helpless
in

feel
herself
under
an
engagement

an
embarrassed
smile

It

charity
to
those

have
a
good
model

feminine
singing

Deronda

<EOS>
"
I
think
everybody
who
have
ear
would
benefit
by
a
little
improvement
on
the
ordinary

if
you
hear
Miss
Lapidoth

here
he
look

they
make
the
thing

seem
worthy

<EOS>
I
can
bear
to

one
about

We
should
have
a
poor
life

<EOS>
a
little
private
imitation
of
what
be
good
be
a
sort
of
private
devotion
to

most
of
us

only
in
the
light
of
private

preparation
to

enjoy
what

She
must
be

very
happy

Juliet

sympathetically

"
  
<EOS>
"
well

since
her

tell

I

that

Sir

listen
with

yes

themselves

a
crack
in
their
voice

husband

public
robber

I
remember
Leroux
saying
,
'
a
man
may
as
well
take
down
a
fine
peal
of
church
bell
and
carry
them
off
to
the
steppe

"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
set
down
his
cup
and
turn
away
,
while
Deronda
,
who
have
move
from
his
place
to
make
room
for
other
,
and
feel
that
he
be
not
in
request
,
sit
down
a
little
apart
.
<EOS>
presently
he
become
aware
that
,
in
the
general
dispersion
of
the
group
,
Gwendolen
have
extricate
herself
from
the
attention
of
Mr.
Vandernoodt
and
have
walk
to
the
piano
,
where
she
stand
apparently
examine
the
music
which
lie
on
the
desk
.
<EOS>
Will
any
one
be
surprised
at
Deronda
's
concluding
that
she
wish
him
to
join
her
?
<EOS>
perhaps
she
want
to
make
amend
for
the
unpleasant
tone
of
resistance
with
which
she
have
meet
his
recommendation
of
Mirah
,
for
he
have
notice
that
her
first
impulse
often
be
to
say
what
she
afterward
wish
to
retract
.
<EOS>
He
go
to
her
side
and
say
    
"

you
relent
about

submissive

"
May
I
know
the
reason

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like

hear
Miss
Lapidoth

lesson
from
her

so
much

that
is
,
of

nothing

have
an
unhappy
life

Her
trouble
begin
in
early
childhood

she
have
grow
up
among
very
painful
surrounding

I
think
you
will
say
that
no
advantage
could
have
give
her
more
grace

truer
refinement

<EOS>

I
wonder
what
sort
of
trouble
her
be
?

<EOS>

I
have
not
any
very
precise

despair

Gwendolen

quietly

Her

move
quickly

be
true

Deronda

that
the
consciousness

have
do
wrong
be
something
deep

more
bitter

I
suppose

faulty

can
never
feel
so
much
for
the
irreproachable

for
those

bruise
in

up
afresh

I
do
not

in
different

<EOS>
I
dare
say
some
would
never
get
their
eye
open
if
it
be
not
for
a
violent
shock
from
the
consequence
of
their
own
action
.
<EOS>
and
when
they
be
suffer
in
that
way
one
must
care
for
them
more
than
for
the
comfortably
self
-
satisfied
.
"
<EOS>
Deronda
forget
everything
but
his
vision
of
what
Gwendolen
's
experience
have
probably
be
,
and
urge
by
compassion
let
his
eye
and
voice
express
as
much
interest
as
they
would
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
have
slip
on
to
the
music
-
stool
,
and
look
up
at
him
with
pain
in
her
long
eye
,
like
a
wounded
animal
ask
for
help
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
persuade
Mrs.
Grandcourt
to
play
to
us
,
Dan
?
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
come
up
and
put
his
hand
on
Deronda
's
shoulder
with
a
gentle
,
admonitory
pinch
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
persuade
myself
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
rise
.
  
<EOS>
other
have
follow
Sir
Hugo
's
lead
,
and
there
be
an
end
of
any
liability
to
confidence
for
that
day
.
<EOS>
but
the
next
be
New
Year
's
Eve
;
and
a
grand
dance
,
to
which
the
chief
tenant
be
invite
,
be
to
be
hold
in
the
picture
-
gallery
above
the
cloister
 
<EOS>
the
sort
of
entertainment
in
which
number
and
general
movement
may
create
privacy
.
<EOS>
when
Gwendolen
be
dress
,
she
long
,
in
remembrance
of
Leubronn
,
to
put
on
the
old
turquoise
necklace
for
her
sole
ornament
;
but
she
dare
not
offend
her
husband
by
appear
in
that
shabby
way
on
an
occasion
when
he
would
demand
her
utmost
splendor
.
<EOS>
determined
to
wear
the
memorial
necklace
<EOS>
somehow
,
she
wind
it
thrice
<EOS>
round
her
wrist
and
make
a
bracelet
of
it
 
have
go
to
her
room
to
put
it
on
just
before
the
time
of
enter
the
ball
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
always
a
beautiful
scene
,
this
dance
on
New
Year
's
Eve
,
which
have
be
keep
up
by
the
family
tradition
as
nearly
in
the
old
fashion
as
inexorable
change
would
allow
.
<EOS>
red
carpet
be
lay
down
for
the
occasion
:
hot
-
house
plant
and
evergreen
be
arrange
in
bower
at
the
extremity
and
in
every
recess
of
the
gallery
;
and
the
old
portrait
stretch
back
through
generation
,
even
to
the
pre

portraying
period
,
make
a
piquant
line
of
spectator
.
<EOS>
some
neighboring
gentry
,
major
and
minor
,
be
invite
;
and
it
be
certainly
an
occasion
when
a
prospective
master
and
mistress
of
Abbott
's
and
King
's
Topping
may
see
their
future
glory
in
an
agreeable
light
,
as
a
picturesque
provincial
supremacy
with
a
rent
-
roll
personify
by
the
most
prosperous

look
tenant
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
expect
Grandcourt
to
feel
flatter
by
be
ask
to
the
Abbey
at
a
time
which
include
this
festival
in
honor
of
the
family
estate
;
but
he
also
hope
that
his
own
hale
appearance
may
impress
his
successor
with
the
probable
length
of
time
that
would
elapse
before
the
succession
come
,
and
with
the
wisdom
of
prefer
a
good
actual
sum
to
a
minor
property
that
must
be
wait
for
.
<EOS>
all
present
,
down
to
the
least
important
farmer
's
daughter
,
know
that
they
be
to
see
"
young
Grandcourt
,
"
Sir
Hugo
's
nephew
,
the
presumptive
heir
and
future
baronet
,
now
visit
the
Abbey
with
his
bride
after
an
absence
of
many
year
;
any
coolness
between
uncle
and
nephew
have
,
it
be
understand
,
give
way
to
a
friendly
warmth
.
<EOS>
the
bride
open
the
ball
with
Sir
Hugo
be
necessarily
the
cynosure
of
all
eye
;
and
less
than
a
year
before
,
if
some
magic
mirror
could
have
show
Gwendolen
her
actual
position
,
she
would
have
imagine
herself
move
in
it
with
a
glow
of
triumphant
pleasure
,
conscious
that
she
hold
in
her
hand
a
life
full
of
favorable
chance
which
her
cleverness
and
spirit
would
enable
her
to
make
the
good
of
.
<EOS>
and
now
she
be
wonder
that
she
could
get
so
little
joy
out
of
the
exultation
to
which
she
have
be
suddenly
lift
,
away
from
the
distasteful
petty
empire
of
her
girlhood
with
its
irksome
lack
of
distinction
and
superfluity
of
sister
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
be
glad
to
be
even
unreasonably
elated
,
and
to
forget
everything
but
the
flattery
of
the
moment
;
but
she
be
like
one
court
sleep
,
in
whom
thought
insist
like
willful
tormentor
.
  
<EOS>
wonder
in
this
way
at
her
own
dullness
,
and
all
the
while
long
for
an
excitement
that
would
deaden
importunate
ache
,
she
be
pass
through
file
of
admire
beholder
in
the
country
-
dance
with
which
it
be
traditional
to
open
the
ball
,
and
be
be
generally
regard
by
her
own
sex
as
an
enviable
woman
.
<EOS>
It
be
remark
that
she
carry
herself
with
a
wonderful
air
,
consider
that
she
have
be
nobody
in
particular
,
and
without
a
farthing
to
her
fortune
.
<EOS>
if
she
have
be
a
duke
's
daughter
,
or
one
of
the
royal
princess
,
she
could
not
have
take
the
honor
of
the
evening
more
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
poor
Gwendolen
!
<EOS>
It
would
by
-
and
-
by
become
a
sort
of
skill
in
which
she
be
automatically
practice
to
hear
this
last
great
gambling
loss
with
an
air
of
perfect
self
-
possession
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
couple
that
pass
be
also
worth
look
at
.
<EOS>
Lady
Pentreath
have
say
,
"
I
shall
stand
up
for
one
dance
,
but
I
shall
choose
my
partner
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Deronda
,
you
be
the
young
man
,
I
mean
to
dance
with
you
.
<EOS>
nobody
be
old
enough
to
make
a
good
pair
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
must
have
a
contrast
.
"
<EOS>
and
the
contrast
certainly
set
off
the
old
lady
to
the
utmost
.
<EOS>
She
be
one
of
those
woman
who
be
never
handsome
till
they
be
old
,
and
she
have
have
the
wisdom
to
embrace
the
beauty
of
age
as
early
as
possible
.
<EOS>
what
may
have
seem
harshness
in
her
feature
when
she
be
young
,
have
turn
now
into
a
satisfactory
strength
of
form
and
expression
which
defy
wrinkle
,
and
be
set
off
by
a
crown
of
white
hair
;
her
well
-
build
figure
be
well
cover
with
black
drapery
,
her
ear
and
neck
comfortably
caress
with
lace
,
show
none
of
those
withered
space
which
one
would
think
it
a
pitiable
condition
of
poverty
to
expose
.
<EOS>
She
glide
along
gracefully
enough
,
her
dark
eye
still
with
a
mischievous
smile
in
them
as
she
observe
the
company
.
<EOS>
Her
partner
's
young
richness
of
tint
against
the
flatten
hue
and
rough
form
of
her
aged
head
have
an
effect
something
like
that
of
a
fine
flower
against
a
lichenous
branch
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
tenant
hardly
appreciate
this
pair
.
<EOS>
Lady
Pentreath
be
nothing
more
than
a
straight
,
active
old
lady
:
Mr.
Deronda
be
a
familiar
figure
regard
with
friendliness
;
but
if
he
have
be
the
heir
,
it
would
have
be
regret
that
his
face
be
not
as
unmistakably
English
as
Sir
Hugo
's
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
's
appearance
when
he
come
up
with
Lady
Mallinger
be
not
impeach
with
foreignness
:
still
the
satisfaction
in
it
be
not
complete
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
matter
of
congratulation
if
one
who
have
the
luck
to
inherit
two
old
family
estate
have
have
more
hair
,
a
fresher
color
,
and
a
look
of
great
animation
;
but
that
fine
family
dwindle
off
into
female
,
and
estate
run
together
into
the
single
heirship
of
a
mealy
-
complexioned
male
,
be
a
tendency
in
thing
which
seem
to
be
account
for
by
a
citation
of
other
instance
.
<EOS>
It
be
agree
that
Mr.
Grandcourt
could
never
be
take
for
anything
but
what
he
be
 
a
bear
gentleman
;
and
that
,
in
fact
,
he
look
like
an
heir
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
person
least
complacently
disposed
toward
him
at
that
moment
be
Lady
Mallinger
,
to
whom
go
in
procession
up
this
country
-
dance
with
Grandcourt
be
a
blazonment
of
herself
as
the
infelicitous
wife
who
have
produce
nothing
but
daughter
,
little
well
than
no
child
,
poor
dear
thing
,
except
for
her
own
fondness
and
for
Sir
Hugo
's
wonderful
goodness
to
them
.
<EOS>
but
such
inward
discomfort
could
not
prevent
the
gentle
lady
from
look
fair
and
stout
to
admiration
,
or
her
full
blue
eye
from
glance
mildly
at
her
neighbor
.
<EOS>
all
the
mother
and
father
hold
it
a
thousand
pity
that
she
have
not
have
a
fine
boy
,
or
even
several
 
which
may
have
be
expect
,
to
look
at
her
when
she
be
first
married
.
  
<EOS>
the
gallery
include
only
three
side
of
the
quadrangle
,
the
fourth
being
shut
off
as
a
lobby
or
corridor
:
one
side
be
use
for
dancing
,
and
the
opposite
side
for
the
supper
-
table
,
while
the
intermediate
part
be
less
brilliantly
light
,
and
fit
with
comfortable
seat
.
<EOS>
later
in
the
evening
Gwendolen
be
in
one
of
these
seat
,
and
Grandcourt
be
stand
near
her
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
talk
to
each
other
:
she
be
lean
backward
in
her
chair
,
and
he
against
the
wall
;
and
Deronda
,
happen
to
observe
this
,
go
up
to
ask
her
if
she
have
resolve
not
to
dance
any
more
.
<EOS>
have
himself
be
do
hard
duty
in
this
way
among
the
guest
,
he
think
he
have
earn
the
right
to
sink
for
a
little
while
into
the
background
,
and
he
have
speak
little
to
Gwendolen
since
their
conversation
at
the
piano
the
day
before
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
's
presence
would
only
make
it
the
easy
to
show
that
pleasure
in
talk
to
her
even
about
triviality
which
would
be
a
sign
of
friendliness
;
and
he
fancy
that
her
face
look
blank
.
<EOS>
a
smile
beam
over
it
as
she
see
him
come
,
and
she
raise
herself
from
her
lean
posture
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
have
be
grumble
at
the
_
ennui
_
of
stay
so
long
in
this
stupid
dance
,
and
propose
that
they
should
vanish
:
she
have
resist
on
the
ground
of
politeness
 
not
without
be
a
little
frightened
at
the
probability
that
he
be
silently
,
angry
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
her
reason
for
staying
,
though
she
have
begin
to
despair
of
the
opportunity
for
the
sake
of
which
she
have
put
the
old
necklace
on
her
wrist
.
<EOS>
but
now
at
last
Deronda
have
come
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
shall
not
dance
any
more
.
<EOS>
be
you
not
glad
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
with
some
gayety
,
"
you
may
have
feel
oblige
humbly
to
offer
yourself
as
a
partner
,
and
I
feel
sure
you
have
dance
more
than
you
like
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
deny
that
,
"
say
Deronda
,
"
since
you
have
dance
as
much
as
you
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
will
you
take
trouble
for
me
in
another
way
,
and
fetch
me
a
glass
of
that
fresh
water
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
but
a
few
step
that
Deronda
have
to
go
for
the
water
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
be
wrap
in
the
light
,
softest
of
white
woolen
burnouse
,
under
which
her
hand
be
hide
.
<EOS>
while
he
be
go
she
have
draw
off
her
glove
,
which
be
finish
with
a
lace
ruffle
,
and
when
she
put
up
her
hand
to
take
the
glass
and
lift
it
to
her
mouth
,
the
necklace
-
bracelet
,
which
in
its
triple
winding
adapt
itself
clumsily
to
her
wrist
,
be
necessarily
conspicuous
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
see
it
,
and
see
that
it
be
attract
Deronda
's
notice
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
hideous
thing
you
have
get
on
your
wrist
?
"
say
the
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
?
"
say
Gwendolen
,
composedly
,
point
to
the
turquoise
,
while
she
still
hold
the
glass
;
"
it
be
an
old
necklace
I
like
to
wear
.
<EOS>
I
lose
it
once
,
and
someone
find
it
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
that
she
give
the
glass
again
to
Deronda
,
who
immediately
carry
it
away
,
and
on
return
say
,
in
order
to
banish
any
consciousness
about
the
necklace
    
<EOS>
"
It
be
worth
while
for
you
to
go
and
look
out
at
one
of
the
window
on
that
side
.
<EOS>
You
can
see
the
fine
possible
moonlight
on
the
stone
pillar
and
carving
,
and
shadow
wave
across
it
in
the
wind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
Will
you
go
?
"
say
Gwendolen
,
look
up
at
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
He
cast
his
eye
down
at
her
,
and
say
,
"
no
,
Deronda
will
take
you
,
"
slowly
move
from
his
lean
attitude
,
and
walk
away
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
face
for
a
moment
show
a
fleeting
vexation
:
she
resent
this
show
of
indifference
toward
her
.
<EOS>
Deronda
feel
annoyed
,
chiefly
for
her
sake
;
and
with
a
quick
sense
,
that
it
would
relieve
her
most
to
behave
as
if
nothing
peculiar
have
occur
,
he
say
,
"
Will
you
take
my
arm
and
go
,
while
only
servant
be
there
?
"
<EOS>
He
think
that
he
understand
well
her
action
in
draw
his
attention
to
the
necklace
:
she
wish
him
to
infer
that
she
have
submit
her
mind
to
rebuke
 
<EOS>
her
speech
and
manner
have
from
the
first
fluctuate
toward
that
submission
 
and
that
she
feel
no
linger
resentment
.
<EOS>
Her
evident
confidence
in
his
interpretation
of
her
appeal
to
him
as
a
peculiar
claim
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
be
walk
together
,
Gwendolen
feel
as
if
the
annoyance
which
have
just
happen
have
remove
another
film
of
reserve
from
between
them
,
and
she
have
more
right
than
before
to
be
as
open
as
she
wish
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
speak
,
be
fill
with
the
sense
of
silent
confidence
,
until
they
be
in
front
of
the
window
look
out
on
the
moonlit
court
.
<EOS>
a
sort
of
bower
have
be
make
round
the
window
,
turn
it
into
a
recess
.
<EOS>
quit
his
arm
,
she
fold
her
hand
in
her
burnous
,
and
press
her
brow
against
the
glass
.
<EOS>
He
move
slightly
away
,
and
hold
the
lapel
of
his
coat
with
his
thumb
under
the
collar
as
his
manner
be
:
he
have
a
wonderful
power
of
stand
perfectly
still
,
and
in
that
position
remind
one
sometimes
of
Dante
's
_
spiriti
magni
con
occhi
tardi
e
gravi
_
.
<EOS>
(
doubtless
some
of
these
dance
in
their

)
<EOS>
He
abstain
from
remark
on
the
scene
before
them
,
fear
that
any
indifferent
word
may
jar
on
her
:
already
the
calm
light
and
shadow
,
the
ancient
steadfast
form
,
and
aloofness
enough
from
those
inward
trouble
which
he
feel
sure
be
agitate
her
.
<EOS>
and
he
judge
aright
:
she
would
have
be
impatient
of
polite
conversation
.
<EOS>
the
incident
of
the
last
minute
or
two
have
recede
behind
former
thought
which
she
have
imagine
herself
utter
to
Deronda
,
which
now
urge
themselves
to
her
lip
.
<EOS>
in
a
subdued
voice
,
she
say
    
"
Suppose
I
have
gamble
again
,
and
lose
the
necklace
again
,
what
should
you
have
think
of
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
bad
than
I
do
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
be
mistaken
about
me
.
<EOS>
You
want
me
not
to
do
that
 
not
to
make
my
gain
out
of
another
's
loss
in
that
way
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
do
a
great
deal
bad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
imagine
temptation
,
"
say
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
be
able
to
understand
what
you
mean
.
<EOS>
at
least
I
understand
self
-
reproach
.
<EOS>
"
in
spite
of
preparation
he
be
almost
alarm
at
Gwendolen
's
precipitancy
of
confidence
toward
him
,
in
contrast
with
her
habitual
resolute
concealment
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
should
you
do
if
you
be
like
me
 
<EOS>
feeling
that
you
be
wrong
and
miserable
,
and
dread
everything
to
come
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
seem
that
she
be
hurry
to
make
the
utmost
use
of
this
opportunity
to
speak
as
she
would
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
not
to
be
amend
by
do
one
thing
only
 
<EOS>
but
many
,
"
say
Deronda
,
decisively
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
?
"
say
Gwendolen
,
hastily
,
move
her
brow
from
the
glass
and
look
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
look
full
at
her
in
return
,
with
what
she
think
be
severity
.
<EOS>
He
feel
that
it
be
not
a
moment
in
which
he
must
let
himself
be
tender
,
and
flinch
from
imply
a
hard
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
there
be
many
thought
and
habit
that
may
help
us
to
bear
inevitable
sorrow

<EOS>
multitude
have
to
bear
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
turn
her
brow
to
the
window
again
,
and
say
impatiently
,
"
You
must
tell
me
then
what
to
think
and
what
to
do
;
else
why
do
you
not
let
me
go
on
do
as
I
like

not
mind
?
<EOS>
if
I
have
go
on
gambling
I
may
have
win
again
,
and
I
may
have
get
not
to
care
for
anything
else

<EOS>
You
would
not

me
do
that

do
as
I

<EOS>
Poor
Gwendolen
's
speech
express
nothing
very
clearly
except
her
irritation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
you
would
ever
get
not

say
Deronda
,
with
deep
-
toned
decision
.
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
true
that
baseness
and
cruelty
make
an
escape
from
pain

what
difference
would
that
make

people
who
can

base

cruel

<EOS>
idiot
escape
some
pain

you
can
not

an
idiot

<EOS>
some
may
do
wrong

suppose
one
do
feel
remorse

<EOS>
I
believe
you

all

pestilential
 
without

"
Deronda
's
unconscious
fervor
have
gather
as
he
go
on
:
he
be
utter
thought
which
he
have
use
for
himself
in
moment
of
painful
meditation

<EOS>
"
then
tell
me
what
better

Gwendolen
,
insistently

the
gratification

small
selfish
desire

something
that

good
apart

"
  
<EOS>
for
an
instant
or
two
Gwendolen
be
mute
.
<EOS>
then
,
again
move
her
brow
from
the
glass
,
she
say
    
"
You

that
I
be
selfish
and
ignorant

<EOS>
He
meet
her
fix
look
in
silence
before
he
answer
firmly
 
"
You
will
not

on

selfish

ignorant

"
  
<EOS>
She
do
not
turn
away
her
glance
or
let
her
eyelid
fall
,
but
a
change
come
over
her
face
 
that
subtle
change
in
nerve
and
muscle
which
will
sometimes
give
a
childlike
expression
even
to
the
elderly
:
it
be
the
subsidence
of
self
-
assertion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
lead
you
back
?
"
say
Deronda
,
gently
,
turn
and
offer
her
his
arm
again
.
<EOS>
She
take
it
silently
,
and
in
that
way
they
come
in
sight
of
Grandcourt
,
who
be
walk
slowly
near
their
former
place
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
go
up
to
him
and
say
,
"
I
be
ready
to
go
now
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Deronda
will
excuse
us
to
Lady
Mallinger
.

"
  
"
certainly
,
"

Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lord
and
Lady
Pentreath
disappear
some
time
ago

<EOS>
Grandcourt
give
his
arm
in
silent
compliance
,
nod
over
his
shoulder
to
Deronda
,
and
Gwendolen
too
only
half
<EOS>
turn
to
bow
and
say
,
"
<EOS>
thank
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
husband
and
wife
leave
the
gallery
and
pace
the
corridor
in
silence
.
<EOS>
when
the
door
have
close
on
them
in
the
boudoir
,
Grandcourt
throw
himself
into
a
chair
and
say
,
with
undertoned
peremptoriness
,
"
sit
down
.
<EOS>
"
She
,
already
in
the
expectation
of
something
unpleasant
,
have
throw
off
her
burnous
with
nervous
unconsciousness
,
and
immediately
obey
.
<EOS>
turn
his
eye
toward
her
,
he
begin
    
"
oblige
me
in
future
by
not
show
whim
like
a
mad
woman
in
a
play
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
?
"
say
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
there
be
some
understanding
between
you
and
Deronda
about
that
thing
you
have
on
your
wrist
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
anything
to
say
to
him
,
say
it
.
<EOS>
but
do
not
carry
on
a
telegraphing
which
other
people
be
suppose
not
to
see

<EOS>
It
be
damnably
vulgar

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
know
all
about
the
necklace
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
her
angry
pride
resist
the
nightmare
of
fear
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
to
know
.
<EOS>
keep
to
yourself
whatever
you
like
.
"
<EOS>
Grandcourt
pause
between
each
sentence
,
and
in
each
his
speech
seem
to
become
more
preternaturally
distinct
in
its
inward
tone
.
<EOS>
"
what
I
care
to
know
I
shall
know
without
your
tell
me
.
<EOS>
only
you
will
please
to
behave
as
become
my
wife
.
<EOS>
and
not
make
a
spectacle
of
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
object
to
my
talking
to
Mr.
Deronda
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
two
straw
about
Deronda
,
or
any
other
conceited
hanger
-
on
.
<EOS>
You
may
talk
to
him
as
much
as
you
like
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
go
to
take
my
place
.
<EOS>
You
be
my
wife
.
<EOS>
and
you
will
either
fill
your
place
properly
 
to
the
world
and
to
me
 
or
you
will
go
to
the
devil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
intend
anything
but
to
fill
my
place
properly
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
with
bitter
mortification
in
her
soul
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
put
that
thing
on
your
wrist
,
and
hide
it
from
me
till
you
want
him
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
only
fool
go
into
that
deaf
and
dumb
talk
,
and
think
they
be
secret
.
<EOS>
You
will
understand
that
you
be
not
to
compromise
yourself
.
<EOS>
behave
with
dignity
.
<EOS>
that
be
all
I
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
with
that
last
word
Grandcourt
rise
,
turn
his
back
to
the
fire
and
look
down
on
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
mute
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
reproach
that
she
dare
to
fling
back
at
him
in
return
for
these
insulting
admonition
,
and
the
very
reason
she
feel
them
to
be
insulting
be
that
their
purport
go
with
the
most
absolute
dictate
of
her
pride
.
<EOS>
what
she
would
least
like
to
incur
be
the
make
a
fool
of
herself
and
be
compromise
.
<EOS>
It
be
futile
and
irrelevant
to
try
and
explain
that
Deronda
too
have
only
be
a
monitor
 
the
strong
of
all
monitor
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
be
contemptuous
,
not
jealous
;
contemptuously
certain
of
all
the
subjection
he
care
for
.
<EOS>
why
could
she
not
rebel
and
defy
him
?
<EOS>
She
long
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
but
she
may
as
well
have
try
to
defy
the
texture
of
her
nerve
and
the
palpitation
of
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
have
a
ghostly
army
at
his
back
,
that
could
close
round
her
wherever
she
may
turn
.
<EOS>
She
sit
in
her
splendid
attire
,
like
a
white
image
of
helplessness
,
and
he
seem
to
gratify
himself
with
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
even
make
a
passionate
exclamation
,
or
throw
up
her
arm
,
as
she
would
have
do
in
her
maiden
day
.
<EOS>
the
sense
of
his
scorn
keep
her
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
ring
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
after
what
seem
to
her
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
She
move
her
head
in
assent
,
and
after
ring
he
go
to
his
dressing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
certain
word
be
gnaw
within
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
wrong
you
have
do
me
will
be
your
own
curse
.
"
<EOS>
as
he
close
the
door
,
the
bitter
tear
rise
,
and
the
gnawing
word
provoke
an
answer
:
"
why
do
you
put
your
fang
into
me
and
not
into
him
?
<EOS>
"
It
be
utter
in
a
whisper
,
as
the
tear
come
up
silently
.
<EOS>
but
she
immediately
press
her
handkerchief
against
her
eye
,
and
check
her
tendency
to
sob
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
,
recover
from
the
shudder
fit
of
this
evening
scene
,
she
determine
to
use
the
charter
which
Grandcourt
have
scornfully
give
her
,
and
to
talk
as
much
as
she
like
with
Deronda
;
but
no
opportunity
occur
,
and
any
little
device
she
could
imagine
for
create
them
be
reject
by
her
pride
,
which
be
now
doubly
active
.
<EOS>
not
toward
Deronda
himself
 
she
be
singularly
free
from
alarm
l
he
should
think
her
openness
want
in
dignity
<EOS>
:
it
be
part
of
his
power
over
her
that
she
believe
him
free
from
all
misunderstanding
as
to
the
way
in
which
she
appeal
to
him
;
or
rather
,
that
he
should
misunderstand
her
have
never
enter
into
her
mind
.
<EOS>
but
the
last
morning
come
,
and
still
she
have
never
be
able
to
take
up
the
drop
thread
of
their
talk
,
and
she
be
without
device
.
<EOS>
She
and
Grandcourt
be
to
leave
at
three
o'clock
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
irritate
that
after
a
walk
in
the
ground
have
be
plan
in
Deronda
's
hearing
,
he
do
not
present
himself
to
join
in
it
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
be
go
with
Sir
Hugo
to
King
's
topping
,
to
see
the
old
manor
-
house
;
other
of
the
gentleman
be
shoot
;
she
be
condemn
to
go
and
see
the
decoy
and
the
waterfowl
,
and
everything
else
that
she
least
want
to
see
,
with
the
lady
,
with
old
Lord
Pentreath
and
his
anecdote
,
with
Mr.
Vandernoodt
and
his
admire
manner
.
<EOS>
the
irritation
become
too
strong
for
her
;
without
premeditation
,
she
take
advantage
of
the
wind
road
to
linger
a
little
out
of
sight
,
and
then
set
off
back
to
the
house
,
almost
run
when
she
be
safe
from
observation
.
<EOS>
She
enter
by
a
side
door
,
and
the
library
be
on
her
left
hand
;
Deronda
,
she
know
,
be
often
there
;
why
may
she
not
turn
in
there
as
well
as
into
any
other
room
in
the
house
?
<EOS>
She
have
be
take
there
expressly
to
see
the
illuminate
family
tree
,
and
other
remarkable
thing
 
<EOS>
what
more
natural
than
that
she
should
like
to
look
in
again
?
<EOS>
the
thing
most
to
be
fear
be
that
the
room
would
be
empty
of
Deronda
,
for
the
door
be
ajar
.
<EOS>
She
push
it
gently
,
and
look
round
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
there
,
write
busily
at
a
distant
table
,
with
his
back
toward
the
door
(
in
fact
,
Sir
Hugo
have
ask
him
to
answer
some
constituent
'
letter
which
have
become
press
)
.
<EOS>
an
enormous
log
fire
,
with
the
scent
of
Russia
from
the
book
,
make
the
great
room
as
warmly
odorous
as
a
private
chapel
in
which
the
censor
have
be
swinge
.
<EOS>
It
seem
too
daring
to
go
in
 
too
rude
to
speak
and
interrupt
him
;
yet
she
go
in
on
the
noiseless
carpet
,
and
stand
still
for
two
or
three
minute
,
till
Deronda
,
have
finish
a
letter
,
push
it
aside
for
signature
,
and
throw
himself
back
to
consider
whether
there
be
anything
else
for
him
to
do
,
or
whether
he
could
walk
out
for
the
chance
of
meet
the
party
which
include
Gwendolen
,
when
he
hear
her
voice
say
,
"
Mr.
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
startling
.
<EOS>
He
rise
hastily
,
turn
round
,
and
push
away
his
chair
with
a
strong
expression
of
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
I
wrong
to
come
in
?
"
say
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
be
far
on
your
walk
,
"
say
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
turn
back
,
"
say
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
intend
to
go
out
again
?
<EOS>
I
could
join
you
now
,
if
you
would
allow
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
want
to
say
something
,
and
I
can
not
stay
long
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
speak
quickly
in
a
subdued
tone
,
while
she
walk
forward
and
rest
her
arm
and
muff
on
the
back
of
the
chair
he
have
push

Gwendolen

nothing

he
go
on
more
insistently

I
take
what
you
say

music

you

four
would

it

We
should
stamp
every

impious

refuge
you

vanity

the
few

find
themselves
in

by
an
elevation

for

the
high

be
a
region

with
knowledge

the
half
-
indignant
remonstrance
that
vibrate
in
Deronda

voice
come
,
as
often
happen
,
from
the
habit
of
inward
argument
with
himself
rather
than
from
severity
toward
Gwendolen
:
but
it
have
a
more
beneficial
effect
on
her
than
any
soothing
.
<EOS>
nothing
be
feeble
than
the
indolent
rebellion
of
complaint
;
and
to
be
rouse
into
self

judgment
be
comparative
activity

<EOS>
for
the
moment

under

pressure

be
apt

away
from

with
quick

consequence
passionately

it

Deronda
utter
each
sentence
more
urgently

as

a
faint
chance

indefinite
danger

Gwendolen
in

loud
whisper

her
eye

lift
up
her
small
gloved
hand

wave
it
in
deprecation
of
the
notion

obey

break
off

expression
on

pierce
her
with
an

He
be
under
the
baffling
difficulty

discerning

into
the
pallid
distance

mere

manage
to
go
up
before
Sir
Hugo
,
who
precede
his
family
that
he
may
be
ready
for
the
opening
of
Parliament
on
the
sixth
of
February
.
<EOS>
Deronda
take
up
his
quarter
in
Park
Lane
,
aware
that
his
chamber
be
sufficiently
tenant
by
Hans
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
this
be
what
he
expect
;
but
he
find
other
thing
not
altogether
accord
to
his
expectation
.
  
<EOS>
Most
of
us
remember
Retzsch
's
drawing
of
destiny
in
the
shape
of
mephistophele
play
at
chess
with
man
for
his
soul
,
a
game
in
which
we
may
imagine
the
clever
adversary
make
a
feint
of
unintended
move
so
as
to
set
the
beguile
mortal
on
carry
his
defensive
piece
away
from
the
true
point
of
attack
.
<EOS>
the
fiend
make
preparation
his
favorite
object
of
mockery
,
that
he
may
fatally
persuade
us
against
our
take
out
waterproofs
when
he
be
well
aware
the
sky
be
go
to
clear
,
foresee
that
the
imbecile
will
turn
this
delusion
into
a
prejudice
against
waterproofs
instead
of
give
a
close
study
to
the
weather
-
sign
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
peculiar
test
of
a
man
's
metal
when
,
after
he
have
painfully
adjust
himself
to
what
seem
a
wise
provision
,
he
find
all
his
mental
precaution
a
little
beside
the
mark
,
and
his
excellent
intention
no
better
than
miscalculate
dovetail
,
accurately
cut
from
a
wrong
starting
-
point
.
<EOS>
His
magnanimity
have
get
itself
ready
to
meet
misbehavior
,
and
find
quite
a
different
call
upon
it
.
<EOS>
something
of
this
kind
happen
to
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
His
first
impression
be
one
of
pure
pleasure
and
amusement
at
find
his
sitting
-
room
transform
into
an
_
ateli
_
strew
with
miscellaneous
drawing
and
with
the
content
of
two
chest
from
Rome
,
the
low
half
of
the
window
darken
with
baize
,
and
the
blonde
Hans
in
his
weird
youth
as
the
preside
genius
of
the
littered
place
 
his
hair
longer
than
of
old
,
his
face
more
whimsically
crease
,
and
his
high
voice
as
usual
get
high
under
the
excitement
of
rapid
talk
.
<EOS>
the
friendship
of
the
two
have
be
keep
up
warmly
since
the
memorable
Cambridge
time
,
not
only
by
correspondence
but
by
little
episode
of
companionship
abroad
and
in
England
,
and
the
original
relation
of
confidence
on
one
side
and
indulgence
on
the
other
have
be
develop
in
practice
,
as
be
will
not
to
be
the
case
where
such
spiritual
borrowing
and
lending
have
be
well
begin
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
would
like
to
see
my
cast
and
antiquity
,
"
say
Hans
,
after
the
first
hearty
greeting
and
inquiry
,
"
<EOS>
so
I
do
not
scruple
to
unlade
my
chest
here
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
find
two
room
at
Chelsea
not
many
hundred
yard
from
my
mother
and
sister
,
and
I
shall
soon
be
ready
to
hang
out
there
 
when
they
have
scrape
the
wall
and
put
in
some
new
light
.
<EOS>
that
be
all
I
be
wait
for
.
<EOS>
but
you
see
I
do
not
wait
to
begin
work
<EOS>
:
you
can
not
conceive
what
a
great
fellow
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
be
.
<EOS>
the
seed
of
immortality
have
sprout
within
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
only
a

growth

I
dare
say
 
a
grow
disease
in
the
lung

"
say
Deronda
,
accustomed
to
treat
Hans
in
brotherly
fashion
.
<EOS>
He
be
walk
toward
some
drawing
prop
on
the
ledge
of
his
bookcase
;
five
rapidly
-
sketch
head
 
different
aspect
of
the
same
face
.
<EOS>
He
stand
at
a
convenient
distance
from
them
,
without
make
any
remark
.
<EOS>
han
,
too
,
be
silent
for
a
minute
,
take
up
his
palette
and
begin
touch
the
picture
on
his
easel
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think
of
them
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
full
face
look
too
massive
;
otherwise
the
likeness
be
good
,
"
say
Deronda
,
more
coldly
than
be
usual
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
it
be
not
too
massive
,
"
say
Hans
,
decisively
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
note
that
.
<EOS>
there
be
always
a
little
surprise
when
one
pass
from
the
profile
to
the
full
face
.
<EOS>
but
I
shall
enlarge
her
scale
for
Berenice
.
<EOS>
I
be
make
a
Berenice
series
 
look
at
the
sketch
along
there
 
<EOS>
and
now
I
think
of
it
<EOS>
,
you
be
just
the
model
I
want
for
the
Agrippa
.
"
<EOS>
han
,
still
with
pencil
and
palette
in
hand
,
have
move
to
Deronda
's
side
while
he
say
this
,
but
he
add
hastily
,
as
if
conscious
of
a
mistake
,
"
no
,
no
,
I
forgot
;
you
do
not
like
sit
for
your
portrait
,
confound
you
!
<EOS>
however
,
I
have
pick
up
a
capital
Titus
.
<EOS>
there
be
to
be
five
in
the
series
.
<EOS>
the
first
be
Berenice
clasp
the
knee
of
Gessius
Florus
and
beseech
him
to
spare
her
people
;
I
have
get
that
on
the
easel
.
<EOS>
then
,
this
,
where
she
be
stand
on
the
Xystus
with
Agrippa
,
entreat
the
people
not
to
injure
themselves
by
resistance
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Agrippa
's
leg
will
never
do
,
"
say
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
leg
be
good
realistically
,
"
say
Hans
,
his
face
crease
drolly
;
"
public
man
be
often
shaky
about
the
leg
 
<EOS>
"
Their
leg
,
the
emblem
of
their
various
thought
,
"
as
somebody
say
in
the
"
Rehearsal
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
these
be
as
impossible
as
the
leg
of
Raphael
's
Alcibiades
,
"
say
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
they
be
good
ideally
,
"
say
Hans
.
<EOS>
"
Agrippa
's
leg
be
possibly
bad
;
I
idealize
that
and
make
them
impossibly
bad
.
<EOS>
art
,
my
Eugenius
,
must
intensify
.
<EOS>
but
never
mind
the
leg
now
:
the
third
sketch
in
the
series
be
Berenice
exult
in
the
prospect
of
be
Empress
of
Rome
,
when
the
news
have
come
that
Vespasian
be
declare
Emperor
and
her
lover
Titus
his
successor
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
must
put
a
scroll
in
her
mouth
,
else
people
will
not
understand
that
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
tell
that
in
a
picture
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
make
them
feel
their
ignorance
then
 
an
excellent
æsthetic
effect
.
<EOS>
the
fourth
be
,
Titus
send
Berenice
away
from
Rome
after
she
have
share
his
palace
for
ten
year
 
both
reluctant
,
both
sad
 
<EOS>
_
invitus
invitam
_
,
as
Suetonius
hath
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
find
a
model
for
the
roman
brute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
you
make
Berenice
look
fifty
?
<EOS>
She
must
have
be
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
;
a
few
mature
touch

dark
-
eyed
beauty
wear
well

,
hers
particularly

now
,
here
be
the
fifth
<EOS>
:
Berenice
seat
lonely
on
the
ruin
of
Jerusalem

<EOS>
that
be
pure
imagination
.
<EOS>
that
be
what
ought
to
have
be
 
perhaps
be
.
<EOS>
now
,
see
how
I
tell
a
pathetic
negative
.
<EOS>
nobody
know
what
become
of
her
 
that
be
finely
indicate
by
the
series
come
to
a
close
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
sixth
picture
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
Hans
pretend
to
speak
with
a
gasping
sense
of
sublimity
,
and
draw
back
his
head
with
a
frown
,
as
if
look
for
a
like
impression
on
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
I
break
off
in
the
Homeric
style
.
<EOS>
the
story
be
chip
off
,
so
to
speak
,
and
pass
with
a
ragged
edge
into
nothing
 
_
le
néant
_
;
can
anything
be
more
sublime
,
especially
in
French
?
<EOS>
the
vulgar
would
desire
to
see
her
corpse
and
burial
 
<EOS>
perhaps
her
will
read
and
her
linen
distribute
.
<EOS>
but
now
come
and
look
at
this
on
the
easel
.
<EOS>
I
have
make
some
way
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
beseech
attitude
be
really
good

say
Deronda
,
after
a
moment
's
contemplation
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
be
very
industrious
in
the
Christmas
holiday
;
for
I
suppose
you
have
take
up
the
subject
since
you
come
to
London

<EOS>
"
neither
of
them
have
yet
mention
Mirah

<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Hans
,
put
touch
to
his
picture

I
make
up
my
mind
to
the

I
take
that
lucky
chance
for
an
augury
that
I
be
go
to
burst
on
the
world
as
a
great
painter

<EOS>
I
see
a
splendid
woman
in
the
Trastevere
 
the
grand
woman
there
be
half
jewess
 
<EOS>
and
she
set
me
hunt
for
a
fine
situation
of
a
Jewess
at
Rome

like
other
man
of
vast
learning

I
end
by
take
what
lie
on
the
surface

I
will
show
you
a
sketch

the
Trasteverina

head

can
lay
my

on
it

<EOS>
"
I
should
think
she
would
be
a
more
suitable

not
know
exactly
how
to
express
his
discontent

not
a

it

have
find
her

have
you
make
yourself
sure
that

to
figure
in

no

would
be
more
abhorrent
to
her

do
she
quite
know
what
you

do
?
<EOS>

certainly

I
get
her
to
throw
herself
precisely
into
this
attitude

little
mother
sit
for
Gessius
Florus

Mirah
clasp
her
knee

<EOS>
here
Hans
go
a
little
way
off

at
the
effect

his
touch

"
I
dare
say

know
nothing
about

Berenice

a
fervid
patriot

beguile
by
love

ambition

herself
to
the
arch

enemy

whence
the
Nemesis

penitent
Berenice

back

desolate
amidst
desolation

"
show
me
your

over

then
clasp
his
coat

toward

himself
into

what

my

answer

the

uproot
my

<EOS>
here
Hans
lay
down
his
pencil
and
palette
,
throw
himself
backward
into
a
great
chair
,
and
hang
limply
over
the
side
,
shake
his
long
hair
over
his
face
,
lift
his
hooked
finger
on
each
side
his
head
,
and
look
up
with
comic
terror
at
Deronda
,
who
be
oblige
to
smile
,
as
he
say
    
"
Paint
as
many

you
like

I
wish
you
could

you

on
reflection

you
should
choose
another
model

"
  
<EOS>
"
why
?
"
say
Hans
,
stand
up
,
and
look
serious
again

"
because
she
may
get
into
such
a
position
that
her
face
be
likely
to
be
recognize
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
and
I
be
anxious
for
her
that
she
should
be
know
as
an
admirable
singer

<EOS>
It
be
right
,
and
she
wish
it
,
that
she
should
make
herself
independent

<EOS>
and
she
have
excellent
chance
.
<EOS>
one
good
introduction
be
secure
already

I
be
go
to
speak
to
Klesmer

<EOS>
Her
face
may
come

well

well

it

useless

I
believe

see
the

clearly

she
would
strongly
object
to
be
exhibit

<EOS>
as
Hans
stand
with
his
thumb
in
the
belt
of
his
blouse
,
listen
to
this
speech
,
his
face
show
a
grow
surprise
melt
into
amusement
,
that
at
last
would
have
its
way
in
an
explosive
laugh
:
but
see
that
Deronda
look
gravely
offend
,
he
check
himself
to
say
,
"
excuse
my
laughing

Deronda

<EOS>
You
never
give
me
an
advantage
over
you
before

<EOS>
if
it
have
be
about
anything
but
my
own
picture
,
I
should
have
swallow
every
word
because
you
say
it
.
<EOS>
and
so
you
actually
believe
that
I
should
get
my
five
picture
hang
on
the
line
in
a
conspicuous
position
,
and
carefully
study
by
the
public
?
<EOS>
zounds
,
man
!
<EOS>
cider
-
cup
and
conceit
never
give
me
half
such
a
beautiful
dream
.
<EOS>
My
picture
be
likely
to
remain
as
private
as
the
utmost
hypersensitiveness
could
desire
.
"
  
<EOS>
han
turn
to
paint
again
as
a
way
of
fill
up
awkward
pause
.
<EOS>
Deronda
stand
perfectly
still
,
recognize
his
mistake
as
to
publicity
,
but
also
conscious
that
his
repugnance
be
not
much
diminish
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
reverse
of
satisfied
either
with
himself
or
with
Hans
;
but
the
power
of
be
quiet
carry
a
man
well
through
moment
of
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
Hans
have
a
reverence
for
his
friend
which
make
him
feel
a
sort
of
shyness
at
Deronda
's
being
in
the
wrong
;
but
it
be
not
in
his
nature
to
give
up
anything
readily
,
though
it
be
only
a
whim
 
or
rather
,
especially
if
it
be
a
whim
,
and
he
presently
go
on
,
paint
the
while
    
"
<EOS>
but
even
suppose
I
have
a
public
rushing
after
my
picture
as
if
they
be
a
railway
series
include
nurse
,
baby
and
bonnet
-
box
,
I
can
not
see
any
justice
in
your
objection
.
<EOS>
every
painter
worth
remembering
have
paint
the
face
he
admire
most
,
as
often
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
part
of
his
soul
that
go
out
into
his
picture
.
<EOS>
He
diffuse
its
influence
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
He
put
what
he
hate
into
a
caricature
.
<EOS>
He
put
what
he
adore
into
some
sacred
,
heroic
form
.
<EOS>
if
a
man
could
paint
the
woman
he
love
a
thousand
time
as
the
Stella
Marts
to
put
courage
into
the
sailor
on
board
a
thousand
ship
,
so
much
the
more
honor
to
her
.
<EOS>
be
not
that
well
than
paint
a
piece
of
stare
immodesty
and
call
it
by
a
worshipful
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
every
objection
can
be
answer
if
you
take
broad
ground
enough
,
Hans
:
no
special
question
of
conduct
can
be
properly
settle
in
that
way
,
"
say
Deronda
,
with
a
touch
of
peremptoriness
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
admit
all
your
generality
,
and
yet
be
right
in
say
you
ought
not
to
publish
Mirah
's
face
as
a
model
for
Berenice
.
<EOS>
but
I
give
up
the
question
of
publicity

I
be
unreasonable
there

Deronda
hesitate
a
moment
.
"
<EOS>
still
,
even
as
a
private
affair
,
there
may
be
good
reason
for
your
not
indulge
yourself
too
much
in
paint
her
from
the
point
of
view
you
mention
.
<EOS>
You
must
feel
that
her
situation
at
present
be
a
very
delicate
one
;
and
until
she
be
in
more
independence
,
she
should
be
keep
as
carefully
as

bit
of

glass

for
fear

her
out

safe

you
quite
sure
of
your

me

Hans

My
having

you

"
  
<EOS>
"
perfectly

Hans

turn
his
face
into
a
good
-
humored
smile
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
the
very
justifiable
opinion
of
me
that
I
be
likely
to
shatter
all
the
glass
in
my
way
,
and
break
my
own
skull
into
the
bargain

<EOS>
quite
fair

no

You
think
I
must
be
over
head

in
love
with
Mirah

<EOS>
quite
right

so
I
be

shall
scream

plunge

spoil
everything

there
you
be

transcendently

I
dare
not
ask
the
oracle

I
prefer
a
cheerful
caliginosity

as
Sir

Browne
may

rather

little
push

<EOS>
He
make
his
tone
kindly
,
but
his
word
be
from
the
lip
only
.
<EOS>
as
to
his
real
feeling
he
be
silence

<EOS>
He
be
conscious
of
that
peculiar
irritation
which
will
sometimes
befall
the
man
whom
other
be
inclined
to
trust
as
a
mentor
 
<EOS>
the
irritation
of
perceive
that
he
be
suppose
to
be
entirely
off
the

plane
of
desire
and
temptation
as
those
who
confess
to
him
.
<EOS>
Our
guide
,
we
pretend
,
must
be
sinless
:
as
if
those
be
not
often
the
good
teacher
who
only
yesterday
get
correct
for
their
mistake
.
<EOS>
throughout
their
friendship
Deronda
have
be
use
to
Hans
's
egotism
,
but
he
have
never
before
feel
intolerant
of
it
:
when
Hans
,
habitually
pour
out
his
own
feeling
and
affair
,
have
never
care
for
any
detail
in
return
,
and
,
if
he
chance
to
know
any
,
and
soon
forget
it
.
<EOS>
Deronda
have
be
inwardly
as
well
as
outwardly
indulgent
 
nay
,
satisfied
.
<EOS>
but
now
he
have
note
with
some
indignation
,
all
the
strong
because
it
must
not
be
betray
,
Hans
's
evident
assumption
that
for
any
danger
of
rivalry
or
jealousy
in
relation
to
Mirah
,
Deronda
be
not
as
much
out
of
the
question
as
the
angel
Gabriel
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
thing
to
be
resolute
in
place
one
's
self
out
of
the
question
,
and
another
to
endure
that
other
should
perform
that
exclusion
for
us
.
<EOS>
He
have
expect
that
Hans
would
give
him
trouble
:
what
he
have
not
expect
be
that
the
trouble
would
have
a
strong
element
of
personal
feeling
.
<EOS>
and
he
be
rather
ashamed
that
Hans
's
hope
cause
him
uneasiness
in
spite
of
his
well
-
warrant
conviction
that
they
would
never
be
fulfil
.
<EOS>
They
have
raise
an
image
of
Mirah
change
;
and
however
he
may
protest
that
the
change
would
not
happen
,
the
protest
keep
up
the
unpleasant
image
.
<EOS>
altogether
poor
Hans
seem
to
be
enter
into
Deronda
's
experience
in
a
disproportionate
manner
 
go
beyond
his
part
of
rescue
prodigal
,
and
rouse
a
feeling
quite
distinct
from
compassionate
affection

<EOS>
when
Deronda
go
to
Chelsea
he
be
not
make
as
comfortable
as
he
ought
to
have
be
by
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
evident
release
from
anxiety
about
the
beloved

incalculable
son

Mirah
seem
lively
than
before

for
the
first
time
he
see
her
laugh

It
be
when
they
be
talk

wish
to

regretfully

"
I
wish
you

<EOS>
I
wish
you

"
the
last
word
be
utter
with
a
serious
ardor
as
if
they
have
be
part
of
a
litany
,
while
her
eye
be
fix
on
Deronda
,
who
with
his
elbow
on
the
back
of
his
chair
be
contemplate
her
by
the
new
light
of
the
impression
she
have
make
on
Hans
,
and
the
possibility
of
her
be
attract
by
that
extraordinary
contrast
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
more
than
what
have
happen
on
each
former
visit
of
his
,
that
Mirah
appear
to
enjoy
speak
of
what
she
feel
very
much
as
a
little
girl
fresh
from
school
<EOS>
pour
forth
spontaneously
all
the
long
-
repress
chat
for
which
she
have
find
willing
ear
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
Mirah
be
among
those
whom
she
entirely
trust
,
and
her
original
visionary
impression
that
Deronda
be
a
divinely
-
send
messenger
hang
about
his
image
still
,
stir
always
anew
the
disposition
to
reliance
and
openness
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
this
way
<EOS>
she
take
what
may
have
be
the
injurious
flattery
of
admire
attention
into
which
her
helpless
dependence
have
be
suddenly
transform
.
<EOS>
every
one
around
her
watch
for
her
look
and
word
,
and
the
effect
on
her
be
simply
that
of
have
pass
from
a
trifling
imprisonment
into
an
exhilarating
air
which
make
speech
and
action
a
delight
.
<EOS>
to
her
mind
it
be
all
a
gift
from
other
'
goodness
.
<EOS>
but
that
word
of
Deronda
's
imply
that
there
have
be
some
lack
in
his
life
which
may
be
compare
with
anything
she
have
know
in
her
,
be
an
entirely
new
inlet
of
thought
about
him
.
<EOS>
after
her
first
expression
of
sorrowful
surprise
she
go
on
    
"
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Hans
say
yesterday
that
you
think
so
much
of
other
you
hardly
want
anything
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
He
tell
us
a
wonderful
story
of
Buddha
give
himself
to
the
famished
tigress
to
save
her
<EOS>
and
her
little
one
from
starve
.
<EOS>
and
he
say
you
be
like
Buddha
.
<EOS>
that
be
what
we
all
imagine
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
pray
do
not
imagine
that
,
"
say
Deronda
,
who
have
lately
be
find
such
supposition
rather
exasperating
.
<EOS>
"
even
if
it
be
true
that
I
think
so
much
of
other
,
it
would
not
follow
that
I
have
no
want
for
myself
.
<EOS>
when
Buddha
let
the
tigress
eat
him
he
may
have
be
very
hungry
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
if
he
be
starve
he
would
not
mind
so
much
about
be
eat

Mab
,
shyly
.
  
<EOS>
"
please
do
not

that
,
Mab

it
take
away
the
beauty
of
the
action

Mirah

if
it
be
true

Mirah

the
rational
Amy

have
a
half
-
holiday
from
her
teaching
;
"
you
always
take
what
be
beautiful
as
if
it
be
true

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
it
be
,
"

Mirah
,
gently
.
<EOS>
"
if
people
have
think
what
be
the
most
beautiful
and
the
good
thing

it
must
be
true

It
be
always
there

now

Mirah

what
do
you
mean

"

Amy

<EOS>

I
understand
her

Deronda

come
to
the
rescue

It
be
a
truth
in
thought
though
it
may
never
have

carry
out
in
action

<EOS>
It
live
as
an
idea

<EOS>
be
that
it

"
<EOS>
He
turn
to
Mirah
,
who
be
listen
with
a
blind
look
in
her
lovely
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
that
,
because
you
understand
me
,
but
I
can
not
quite
explain
,
"
say
Mirah
,
rather
abstractedly
 
still
search
for
some
expression
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
_
be
_
<EOS>
it
beautiful
for
Buddha
to
let
the
tiger
eat
him
?
"
say
Amy
,
change
her
ground
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
a
bad
pattern
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
world
would
get
full
of
fat
tiger
,
"
say
Mab
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
laugh
,
but
defend
the
myth
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
like
a
passionate
word
,
"
he
say
;
"
the
exaggeration
be
a
flash
of
fervor
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
extreme
image
of
what
be
happen
every
day
-
the
transmutation
of
self
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
can
say
what
I
mean
,
now
,
"
say
Mirah
,
who
have
not
hear
the
intermediate
talk
.
<EOS>
"
when
the
good
thing
come
into
our
thought
,
it
be
like
what
my
mother
have
be
to
me
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
just
as
really
with
me
as
all
the
other
people
about
me
 
often
more
really
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
,
inwardly
wince
under
this
illustration
,
which
bring
other
possible
reality
about
that
mother
vividly
before
him
,
presently
turn
the
conversation
by
say
,
"
but
we
must
not
get
too
far
away
from
practical
matter
.
<EOS>
I
come
,
for
one
thing
,
to
tell
of
an
interview
I
have
yesterday
,
which
I
hope
Mirah
will
find
to
have
be
useful
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
with
Klesmer
,
the
great
pianist
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
?
"
say
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
with
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
"
You
think
he
will
help
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
much
occupy
,
but
have
promise
to
fix
a
time
for
receiving
and
hear
Miss
Lapidoth
,
as
we
must
learn
to
call
her
<EOS>
"
 
here
Deronda
smile
at
Mirah
 
"
if
she
consent
to
go
to
him

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
very
grateful
,
"

Mirah
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
want
to
hear
me
sing

before
he
can
judge
whether
I
ought
to

<EOS>
"
  
Deronda
be
strike
with
her
plain
sense
about
these
matter
of
practical
concern
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
be
at
all
try
to
you
,
I
hope
,
if
Mrs.
Meyrick
will
kindly
go
with
you
to
Klesmer

house

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no

not
at

<EOS>
I
have

do
that
all
my

I
mean
,
tell
to
do
thing
that
other

<EOS>
and
I
have
go
through
a
bad
trial
of

<EOS>
I
be
prepared
to
bear
it

and
do
some
very
small
thing
.
<EOS>
be
Klesmer
a
severe
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
peculiar
,
but
I
have
not
have
experience
enough
of
him
to
know
whether
he
would
be
what
you
would
call
severe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
he
be
kind

hearted
 
kind
in
action

if
not
in
speech

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
use
to
be
frown
at
and
not

Mirah

<EOS>
"
by
the
by
,
Klesmer
frown
a
good
deal
,
"
say
Deronda
,
"
but
there
be
often
a
sort
of
smile
in
his
eye
all
the
while
.
<EOS>
unhappily
he
wear
spectacle
,
so
you
must
catch
him
in
the
right
light

see
the
smile

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not

Mirah

"
if
he
be
like
a
roar
lion

he
only
want
me
to
sing

<EOS>
I
shall
do
what
I
can

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
feel
sure
you
will
not

be
invite
to
sing
in
Lady
Mallinger

drawing

room

"
say
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
She
intend
to
ask
you
next
month

will
invite
many

want
lesson

"
  
<EOS>
"
how
fast
we
be
mount
!

say
Mrs.

with
delight

<EOS>
"
You
never
think
of
get
grand
so
quickly

Mirah

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
a
little
frightened
at
be
call
Miss
Lapidoth

"

Mirah
,
color
with
a
new
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
"
may
I
be
call
Cohen

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
you
,
"
say
Deronda
,
promptly
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
assure
you
,
you
must
not
be
call
Cohen
.
<EOS>
the
name
be
inadmissible
for
a
singer
.
<EOS>
this
be
one
of
the
trifle
in
which
we
must
conform
to
vulgar
prejudice
.
<EOS>
We
could
choose
some
other
name
,
however
 
such
as
singer
ordinarily
choose
 
an
italian
or
spanish
name
,
which
would
suit
your
_
physique
_
.
"
<EOS>
to
Deronda
just
now
the
name
Cohen
be
equivalent
to
the
ugly
of
yellow
badge
.
  
<EOS>
Mirah
reflect
a
little
,
anxiously
,
then
say
,
"
no
.
<EOS>
if
Cohen
will
not
do
,
I
will
keep
the
name
I
have
be
call
by
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
hide
myself
.
<EOS>
I
have
friend
to
protect
me
.
<EOS>
and
now
 
if
my
father
be
very
miserable
and
wanted
help
 
no
,
"
she
say
,
look
at
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
"
I
should
think
,
then
,
that
he
be
perhaps
cry
as
I
use
to
see
him
,
and
have
nobody
to
pity
him
,
and
I
have
hide
myself
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
none
belong
to
him
but
me
.
<EOS>
other
that
make
friend
with
him
always
leave
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
keep
to
what
you
feel
right
,
my
dear
child
,
"
say
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
_
I
_
would
not
persuade
you
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
"
for
her
own
part
she
have
no
patience
or
pity
for
that
father
,
and
would
have
leave
him
to
his
crying
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
be
say
to
himself
,
"
I
be
rather
base
to
be
angry
with
Hans
.
<EOS>
how
can
he
help
be
in
love
with
her
?
<EOS>
but
it
be
too
absurdly
presumptuous
for
him
even
to
frame
the
idea
of
appropriate
her
,
and
a
sort
of
blasphemy
to
suppose
that
she
could
possibly
give
herself
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
what
would
it
be
for
Daniel
Deronda
to
entertain
such
thought
?
<EOS>
He
be
not
one
who
could
quite
naively
introduce
himself
where
he
have
just
exclude
his
friend
,
yet
it
be
undeniable
that
what
have
just
happen
make
a
new
stage
in
his
feeling
toward
Mirah
.
<EOS>
but
apart
from
other
ground
for
self
-
repression
,
reason
both
definite
and
vague
make
him
shut
away
that
question
as
he
may
have
shut
up
a
half
-
open
writing
that
would
have
carry
his
imagination
too
far
,
and
give
too
much
shape
to
presentiment
.
<EOS>
may
there
not
come
a
disclosure
which
would
hold
the
miss
determination
of
his
course
?
<EOS>
what
do
he
really
know
about
his
origin
?
<EOS>
strangely
in
these
latter
month
when
it
seem
right
that
he
should
exert
his
will
in
the
choice
of
a
destination
,
the
passion
of
his
nature
have
get
more
and
more
lock
by
this
uncertainty
.
<EOS>
the
disclosure
may
bring
its
pain
,
indeed
the
likelihood
seem
to
him
to
be
all
on
that
side
;
but
if
it
help
him
to
make
his
life
a
sequence
which
would
take
the
form
of
duty
 
if
it
save
him
from
have
to
make
an
arbitrary
selection
where
he
feel
no
preponderance
of
desire
?
<EOS>
still
more
,
he
want
to
escape
stand
as
a
critic
outside
the
activity
of
man
,
stiffen
into
the
ridiculous
attitude
of
self
-
assign
superiority
.
<EOS>
His
chief
tether
be
his
early
inwrought
affection
for
Sir
Hugo
,
make
him
gratefully
deferential
to
wish
with
which
he
have
little
agreement
:
but
gratitude
have
be
sometimes
disturb
by
doubt
which
be
near
reduce
it
to
a
fear
of
be
ungrateful
.
<EOS>
many
of
us
complain
that
half
our
birthright
be
sharp
duty
:
Deronda
be
more
inclined
to
complain
that
he
be
rob
of
this
half
;
yet
he
accuse
himself
,
as
he
would
have
accuse
another
,
of
be
weakly
self
-
conscious
and
want
in
resolve
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
reverse
of
that
type
paint
for
us
in
Faulconbridge
and
Edmund
of
Gloster
,
whose
coarse
ambition
for
personal
success
be
inflame
by
a
defiance
of
accidental
disadvantage
.
<EOS>
to
Daniel
the
word
Father
and
Mother
have
the
altar
-
fire
in
them
;
and
the
thought
of
all
close
relation
of
our
nature
hold
still
something
of
the
mystic
power
which
have
make
his
neck
and
ear
burn
in
boyhood
.
<EOS>
the
average
man
may
regard
this
sensibility
on
the
question
of
birth
as
preposterous
and
hardly
credible
;
but
with
the
utmost
respect
for
his
knowledge
as
the
rock
from
which
all
other
knowledge
be
hew
,
it
must
be
admit
that
many
well
-
prove
fact
be
dark
to
the
average
man
,
even
concern
the
action
of
his
own
heart
and
the
structure
of
his
own
retina
.
<EOS>
a
century
ago
he
and
all
his
forefather
have
not
have
the
slight
notion
of
that
electric
discharge
by
mean
of
which
they
have
all
wag
their
tongue
mistakenly
;
any
more
than
they
be
awake
to
the
secluded
anguish
of
exceptional
sensitiveness
into
which
many
a
carelessly
-
begotten
child
of
man
be
bear
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
the
ferment
be
all
the
strong
in
Deronda
's
mind
because
he
have
never
have
a
confidant
to
whom
he
could
open
himself
on
these
delicate
subject
.
<EOS>
He
have
always
be
lean
on
instead
of
be
invite
to
lean
.
<EOS>
sometimes
he
have
long
for
the
sort
of
friend
to
whom
he
may
possibly
unfold
his
experience
:
a
young
man
like
himself
who
sustain
a
private
grief
and
be
not
too
confident
about
his
own
career
;
speculative
enough
to
understand
every
moral
difficulty
,
yet
socially
susceptible
,
as
he
himself
be
,
and
have
every
outward
sign
of
equality
either
in
bodily
or
spiritual
wrestling
;
 
for
he
have
find
it
impossible
to
reciprocate
confidence
with
one
who
look
up
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
no
expectation
of
meet
the
friend
he
imagine
.
<EOS>
Deronda
's
be
not
one
of
those
quiveringly
-
poise
nature
that
lend
themselves
to
second
-
sight
.
        
<EOS>
there
be
who
hold
that
the
deep
tragedy
be
a
Prometheus
Bound
not
    
_
after
_
<EOS>
but
_
<EOS>
before
_
he
have
well
get
the
celestial
fire
into
    
the
_
narthex
_
whereby
it

into
a
solitude
of
despised
    
idea
,
fasten
in

helplessness
by
the
fatal

of
    
poverty
and

a

where

"

be

<EOS>
but
it
be
matter
of
knowledge
that
there
be
person
whose
yearning
,
conception
 
nay
,
travel
conclusion
 
continually
take
the
form
of

which
have
a

power
;
the

they

the

they
hunger
for
or
dread
rise
into
vision
with
a

like

,
feed
itself
fast
on

<EOS>
They
be
not
always
the
less
capable
of
the
argumentative
process
,
nor
less
sane
than
the
commonplace
calculator
of
the
market
:
sometimes
it
may
be
that
their
nature
have
manifold
opening
,
like
the
hundred
-
gate
Thebes
,
where
there
may
naturally
be
a
great
and
more
miscellaneous
inrush
than
through
a
narrow
beadle
-
watch
portal
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
there
be
abject
specimen
of
the
visionary
,
as
there
be
a
minim
mammal
which
you
may
imprison
in
the
finger
of
your

.
<EOS>
that
small
relative
of
the
elephant
have
no
harm
in
him
;
but
what
great
mental
or
social
type
be
free
from
specimen
whose
insignificance
be
both
ugly
and
noxious
?
<EOS>
one
be
afraid
to
think
of
all
that
the
genus
"
patriot
"
embrace
;
or
of
the
elbowing
there
may
be
at
the
day
of
judgment
for
those
who
rank
as
author
,
and
bring
volume
either
in
their
hand
or
on
truck
.
  
<EOS>
this
apology
for
inevitable
kinship
be
mean
to
usher
in
some
fact
about
Mordecai
,
whose
figure
have
bite
itself
into
Deronda
's
mind
as
a
new
question
which
he
feel
an
interest
in
get
answer
.
<EOS>
but
the
interest
be
no
more
than
a
vaguely
-
expectant
suspense
:
the
consumptive
-
look
Jew
,
apparently
a
fervid
student
of
some
kind
,
get
his
crust
by
a
quiet
handicraft
,
like
Spinoza
,
fit
into
none
of
Deronda
's
anticipation
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
otherwise
with
the
effect
of
their
meeting
on
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
for
many
winter
,
while
he
have
be
conscious
of
an
ebbing
physical
life
,
and
as
widen
spiritual
loneliness
,
all
his
passionate
desire
have
concentrate
itself
in
the
yearning
for
some
young
ear
into
which
he
could
pour
his
mind
as
a
testament
,
some
soul
kindre
enough
to
accept
the
spiritual
product
of
his
own
brief
,
painful
life
,
as
a
mission
to
be
execute
.
<EOS>
It
be
remarkable
that
the
hopefulness
which
be
often
the
beneficent
illusion
of
consumptive
patient
,
be
in
Mordecai
wholly
divert
from
the
prospect
of
bodily
recovery
and
carry
into
the
current
of
this
yearning
for
transmission
.
<EOS>
the
yearning
,
which
have
pant
upward
from
out
of
over
-
whelm
discouragement
,
have
grow
into
a
hope
 
<EOS>
the
hope
into
a
confident
belief
,
which
,
instead
of
be
check
by
the
clear
conception
he
have
of
his
hasten
decline
,
take
rather
the
intensity
of
expectant
faith
in
a
prophecy
which
have
only
brief
space
to
get
fulfil
in
.
  
<EOS>
some
year
have
now
go
since
he
have
first
begin
to
measure
man
with
a
keen
glance
,
search
for
a
possibility
which
become
more
and
more
a
distinct
conception
.
<EOS>
such
distinctness
as
it
have
at
first
be
reach
chiefly
by
a
method
of
contrast
:
he
want
to
find
a
man
who
differ
from
himself
.
<EOS>
trace
reason
in
that
self
for
the
rebuff
he
have
meet
with
and
the
hindrance
that
beset
him
,
he
imagine
a
man
who
would
have
all
the
element
necessary
for
sympathy
with
him
,
but
in
an
embodiment
unlike
his
own
:
he
must
be
a
Jew
,
intellectually
cultured
,
<EOS>
morally
fervid
 
in
all
this
a
nature
ready
to
be
plenishe
from
Mordecai
's
;
but
his
face
and
frame
must
be
beautiful
and
strong
,
he
must
have
be
use
to
all
the
refinement
of
social
life
,
his
voice
must
flow
with
a
full
and
easy
current
,
his
circumstance
be
free
from
sordid
need
:
he
must
glorify
the
possibility
of
the
Jew
,
not
sit
and
wonder
as
Mordecai
do
,
bear
the
stamp
of
his
people
amid
the
sign
of
poverty
and
wane
breath
.
<EOS>
sensitive
to
physical
characteristic
,
he
have
,
both
abroad
and
in
England
,
look
at
picture
as
well
as
man
,
and
in
a
vacant
hour
he
have
sometimes
linger
in
the
National
Gallery
in
search
of
painting
which
may
feed
his
hopefulness
with
grave
and
noble
type
of
the
human
form
,
such
as
may
well
belong
to
man
of
his
own
race
.
<EOS>
but
he
return
in
disappointment
.
<EOS>
the
instance
be
scatter
but
thinly
over
the
gallery
of
Europe
,
in
which
the
fortune
or
selection
even
of
the
chief
master
have
give
to
art
a
face
at
once
young
,
grand
,
and
beautiful
,
where
,
if
there
be
any
melancholy
,
it
be
no
feeble
passivity
,
but
enter
into
the
foreshadow
capability
of
heroism
.
  
<EOS>
some
observant
person
may
perhaps
remember
his
emaciate
figure
,
and
dark
eye
deep
in
their
socket
,
as
he
stand
in
front
of
a
picture
that
have
touch
him
either
to
new
or
habitual
meditation
:
he
commonly
wear
a
cloth
cap
with
black
fur
round
it
,
which
no
painter
would
have
ask
him
to
take
off
.
<EOS>
but
spectator
would
be
likely
to
think
of
him
as
an
odd
-
look
Jew
who
probably
get
money
out
of
picture
;
and
Mordecai
,
when
he
look
at
them
,
be
perfectly
aware
of
the
impression
he
make
.
<EOS>
experience
have
render
him
morbidly
alive
to
the
effect
of
a
man
's
poverty
and
other
physical
disadvantage
in
cheapen
his
idea
,
unless
they
be
those
of
a
Peter
the
Hermit
who
have
a
tocsin
for
the
rabble
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
too
sane
and
generous
to
attribute
his
spiritual
banishment
solely
to
the
excusable
prejudice
of
other
;
certain
incapacity
of
his
own
have
make
the
sentence
of
exclusion
;
and
hence
it
be
that
his
imagination
have
construct
another
man
who
would
be
something
more
ample
than
the
second
soul
bestow
,
accord
to
the
notion
of
the
Cabbalists
,
to
help
out
the
insufficient
first
 
who
would
be
a
bloom
human
life
,
ready
to
incorporate
all
that
be
worthy
in
an
existence
whose
visible
,
palpable
part
be
burn
itself
fast
away
.
<EOS>
His
inward
need
for
the
conception
of
this
expand
,
prolonged
self
be
reflect
as
an
outward
necessity
.
<EOS>
the
thought
of
his
heart
(
that
ancient
phrase
good
shadow
the
truth
)
seem
to
him
too
precious
,
too
closely
interwoven
with
the
growth
of
thing
not
to
have
a
further
destiny
.
<EOS>
and
as
the
more
beautiful
,
the
strong
,
the
more
executive
self
take
shape
in
his
mind
,
he
love
it
beforehand
with
an
affection
half
identify
,
half
contemplative
and
grateful
.
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
's
mind
work
so
constantly
in
image
,
that
his
coherent
train
of
thought
often
resemble
the
significant
dream
attribute
to
sleeper
by
wake
person
in
their
most
inventive
moment
:
nay
,
they
often
resemble
genuine
dream
in
their
way
of
break
off
the
passage
from
the
know
to
the
unknown
.
<EOS>
thus
,
for
a
long
while
,
he
habitually
think
of
the
be
answer
to
his
need
as
one
distantly
approach
or
turn
his
back
toward
him
,
darkly
paint
against
a
golden
sky
.
<EOS>
the
reason
of
the
golden
sky
lie
in
one
of
Mordecai
's
habit
.
<EOS>
He
be
keenly
alive
to
some
poetic
aspect
of
London
;
and
a
favorite
resort
of
his
,
when
strength
and
leisure
allow
,
be
to
some
of
the
bridge
,
especially
about
sunrise
or
sunset
.
<EOS>
even
when
he
be
bend
over
watch
-
wheel
and
trinket
,
or
seat
in
a
small
upper
room
look
out
on
dingy
brick
and
dingy
crack
windows
,
his
imagination
spontaneously
plant
him
on
some
spot
where
he
have
a
far
-
stretch
scene
;
his
thought
go
on
in
wide
space
;
and
whenever
he
could
,
he
try
to
have
in
reality
the
influence
of
a
large
sky
.
<EOS>
lean
on
the
parapet
of
Blackfriar
's
Bridge
,
and
gaze
meditatively
,
the
breadth
and
calm
of
the
river
,
with
its
long
vista
half
hazy
,
half
luminous
,
the
grand
dim
masse
of
tall
form
of
building
which
be
the
sign
of
world
-
commerce
,
the
oncoming
of
boat
and
barge
from
the
still
distance
into
sound
and
color
,
enter
into
his
mood
and
blent
themselves
indistinguishably
with
his
thinking
,
as
a
fine
symphony
to
which
we
can
hardly
be
say
to
listen
,
make
a
medium
that
bear
up
our
spiritual
wing
.
<EOS>
thus
it
happen
that
the
figure
representative
of
Mordecai
's
longing
be
mentally
see
darken
by
the
excess
of
light
in
the
aerial
background
.
<EOS>
but
in
the
inevitable
progress
of
his
imagination
toward
full
detail
,
he
cease
to
see
the
figure
with
its
back
toward
him
.
<EOS>
It
begin
to
advance
,
and
a
face
become
discernible
;
the
word
youth
,
beauty
,
refinement
,
jewish
birth
,
noble
gravity
,
turn
into
hardly
individual
but
typical
form
and
color
:
gather
from
his
memory
of
face
see
among
the
Jews
of
Holland
and
Bohemia
,
and
from
the
painting
which
revive
that
memory
.
<EOS>
reverently
let
it
be
say
of
this
mature
spiritual
need
that
it
be
akin
to
the
boy
's
and
girl
's
picturing
of
the
future
beloved
;
but
the
stirring
of
such
young
desire
be
feeble
compare
with
the
passionate
current
of
an
ideal
life
strain
to
embody
itself
,
make
intense
by
resistance
to
imminent
dissolution
.
<EOS>
the
visionary
form
become
a
companion
and
auditor
;
keep
a
place
not
only
in
the
wake
imagination
,
but
in
those
dream
of
light
slumber
of
which
it
be
true
to
say
,
"
I
sleep
,
but
my
heart
waketh
"
 
when
the
disturb
trivial
story
of
yesterday
be
charge
with
the
impassioned
purpose
of
year
.
  
<EOS>
of
late
the
urgency
of
irremediable
time
,
measure
by
the
gradual
choking
of
life
,
have
turn
Mordecai
's
trust
into
an
agitated
watch
for
the
fulfillment
that
must
be
at
hand
.
<EOS>
be
the
bell
on
the
verge
of
tolling
,
the
sentence
about
to
be
execute
?
<EOS>
the
deliverer
's
footstep
must
be
near
 
the
deliverer
who
be
to
rescue
Mordecai
's
spiritual
travail
from
oblivion
,
and
give
it
an
abiding
-
place
in
the
good
heritage
of
his
people
.
<EOS>
an
insane
exaggeration
of
his
own
value
,
even
if
his
idea
have
be
as
true
and
precious
as
those
of
Columbus
or
Newton
,
many
would
have
count
this
yearning
,
take
it
as
the
sublimer
part
for
a
man
to
say
,
"
<EOS>
if
not
I
,
then
another
,
"
and
to
hold
cheap
the
meaning
of
his
own
life
.
<EOS>
but
the
full
nature
desire
to
be
an
agent
,
to
create
,
and
not
merely
to
look
on
:
strong
love
hunger
to
bless
,
and
not
merely
to
behold
blessing
.
<EOS>
and
while
there
be
warmth
enough
in
the
sun
to
feed
an
energetic
life
,
there
will
still
be
man
to
feel
,
"
I
be
lord
of
this
moment
's
change
,
and
will
charge
it
with
my
soul
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
with
that
mingling
of
inconsequence
which
belong
to
us
all
,
and
not
unhappily
,
since
it
save
us
from
many
effect
of
mistake
,
Mordecai
's
confidence
in
the
friend
to
come
do
not
suffice
to
make
him
passive
,
and
he
try
expedient
,
pathetically
humble
,
such
as
happen
to
be
within
his
reach
,
for
communicate
something
of
himself
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
two
year
since
he
have
take
up
his
abode
under
Ezra
Cohen
's
roof
,
where
he
be
regard
with
much
good
-
will
as
a
compound
of
workman
,
dominie
,
vessel
of
charity
,
inspire
idiot
,
man
of
piety
,
and
(
if
he
be
inquire
into
)
dangerous
heretic
.
<EOS>
during
that
time
little
Jacob
have
advance
into
knickerbocker
,
and
into
that
quickness
of
apprehension
which
have
be
already
make
manifest
in
relation
to
hardware
and
exchange
.
<EOS>
He
have
also
advance
in
attachment
to
Mordecai
,
regard
him
as
an
inferior
,
but
like
him
none
the
bad
,
and
take
his
helpful
cleverness
as
he
may
have
take
the
service
of
an
enslave
Djinn
.
<EOS>
as
for
Mordecai
,
he
have
give
Jacob
his
first
lesson
,
and
his
habitual
tenderness
easily
turn
into
the
teacher
's
fatherhood
.
<EOS>
though
he
be
fully
conscious
of
the
spiritual
distance
between
the
parent
and
himself
,
and
would
never
have
attempt
any
communication
to
them
from
his
peculiar
world
,
the
boy
move
him
with
that
idealizing
affection
which
merge
the
quality
of
the
individual
child
in
the
glory
of
childhood
and
the
possibility
of
a
long
future
.
<EOS>
and
this
feeling
have
draw
him
on
,
at
first
without
premeditation
,
and
afterward
with
conscious
purpose
,
to
a
sort
of
outpoure
in
the
ear
of
the
boy
which
may
have
seem
wild
enough
to
any
excellent
man
of
business
who
overhear
it
.
<EOS>
but
none
overhear
when
Jacob
go
up
to
Mordecai
's
room
one
day
,
for
example
,
in
which
there
be
little
work
to
be
do
,
or
at
an
hour
when
the
work
be
end
,
and
after
a
brief
lesson
in
English
reading
or
in
numeration
,
be
induce
to
remain
stand
at
his
teacher
's
knee
,
or
choose
to
jump
astride
them
,
often
to
the
patient
fatigue
of
the
waste
limb
.
<EOS>
the
inducement
be
perhaps
the
mending
of
a
toy
,
or
some
little
mechanical
device
in
which
Mordecai
's
well
-
practice
finger
-
tip
have
an
exceptional
skill
;
and
with
the
boy
thus
tether
,
he
would
begin
to
repeat
a
hebrew
poem
of
his
own
,
into
which
year
before
he
have
pour
his
first
youthful
ardor
for
that
conception
of
a
blended
past
and
future
which
be
the
mistress
of
his
soul
,
tell
Jacob
to
say
the
word
after
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
boy
will
get
them
engrave
within
him
,
"
think
Mordecai
;
"
it
be
a
way
of
printing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
none
ready
than
Jacob
at
this
fascinating
game
of
imitate
unintelligible
word
;
and
if
no
oppose
diversion
occur
he
would
sometimes
carry
on
his
share
in
it
as
long
as
the
teacher
's
breath
would
last
out
.
<EOS>
for
Mordecai
throw
into
each
repetition
the
fervor
befit
a
sacred
occasion
.
<EOS>
in
such
instance
,
Jacob
would
show
no
other
distraction
than
reach
out
and
survey
the
content
of
his
pocket
;
or
draw
down
the
skin
of
his
cheek
to
make
his
eye
look
awful
,
and
roll
his
head
to
complete
the
effect
;
or
alternately
handle
his
own
nose
and
Mordecai
<EOS>
's
as
if
to
test
the
relation
of
their
masse
.
<EOS>
under
all
this
the
fervid
reciter
would
not
pause
,
satisfied
if
the
young
organ
of
speech
would
submit
themselves
.
<EOS>
but
most
commonly
a
sudden
impulse
send
Jacob
leap
away
into
some
antic
or
active
amusement
,
when
,
instead
of
follow
the
recitation
he
would
return
upon
the
foregoing
word
most
ready
to
his
tongue
,
and
mouth
or
gabble
,
with
a
see
-
see
suit
to
the
action
of
his
limb
,
a
verse
on
which
Mordecai
have
spend
some
of
his
too
scanty
heart
's
blood
.
<EOS>
yet
he
wait
with
such
patience
as
a
prophet
need
,
and
begin
his
strange
printing
again
undiscourage
on
the
morrow
,
say
inwardly
    
"
My
word
may
rule
him
some
day
.
<EOS>
Their
meaning
may
flash
out
on
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
with
a
nation
 
after
many
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
Jacob
's
sense
of
power
be
increase
and
his
time
enliven
by
a
store
of
magical
articulation
with
which
he
make
the
baby
crow
,
or
drive
the
large
cat
into
a
dark
corner
,
or
promise
himself
to
frighten
any
incidental
Christian
of
his
own
year
.
<EOS>
one
week
he
have
unfortunately
see
a
street
mountebank
,
and
this
carry
off
his
muscular
imitativeness
in
sad
divergence
from
New
Hebrew
poetry
,
after
the
model
of
Jehuda
ha
-
Levi
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
have
arrive
at
a
fresh
passage
in
his
poem
;
for
as
soon
as
Jacob
have
get
well
use
to
one
portion
,
he
be
lead
on
to
another
,
and
a
fresh
combination
of
sound
generally
answer
better
in
keep
him
fast
for
a
few
minute
.
<EOS>
the
consumptive
voice
,
generally
a
strong
high
baritone
,
with
its
variously
mingling
hoarseness
,
like
a
haze
amidst
illumination
,
and
its
occasional
incipient
gasp
have
more
than
the
usual
excitement
,
while
it
give
forth
Hebrew
verse
with
a
mean
something
like
this
:
      
<EOS>
"
away
from
me
the
garment
of
forgetfulness
.
  
<EOS>
wither
the
heart
;
  
the
oil
and
wine
from
press
of
the
Goyim
,
  
poison
with
scorn
.
  
<EOS>
Solitude
be
on
the
side
of
Mount
Nebo
,
  
<EOS>
in
its
heart
a
tomb
:
  
<EOS>
there
the
bury
ark
and
golden
cherubim
  
make
hidden
light
:
  
<EOS>
there
the
solemn
gaze
unchanged
,
  
<EOS>
the
wing
be
spread
unbroken
:
  
Shut
beneath
in
silent
awful
speech
  
<EOS>
the
Law
lie
grave
.
  
<EOS>
solitude
and
darkness
be
my
covering
,
  
and
my
heart
a
tomb
;
  
Smite
and
shatter
it
,
o
Gabriel
!
  
<EOS>
shatter
it
as
the
clay
of
the
founder
  
around
the
golden
image
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
the
absorbing
enthusiasm
with
which
Mordecai
have
intone
rather
than
speak
this
last
invocation
,
he
be
unconscious
that
Jacob
have
cease
to
follow
him
and
have
start
away
from
his
knee
;
but
pause
he
see
,
as
by
a
sudden
flash
,
that
the
lad
have
throw
himself
on
his
hand
with
his
foot
in
the
air
,
mountebank
fashion
,
and
be
pick
up
with
his
lip
a
bright
farthing
which
be
a
favorite
among
his
pocket
treasure
.
<EOS>
this
may
have
be
reckon
among
the
trick
Mordecai
be
use
to
,
but
at
this
moment
it
jar
him
horribly
,
as
if
it
have
be
a
Satanic
grin
upon
his
prayer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Child
!
child
!
"
<EOS>
he
call
out
with
a
strange
cry
that
startle
Jacob
to
his
foot
,
and
then
he
sink
backward
with
a
shudder
,
close
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
?
"
say
Jacob
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
then
,
not
get
an
immediate
answer
,
he
press
Mordecai
's
knee
with
a
shake
movement
,
in
order
to
rouse
him
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
open
his
eye
with
a
fierce
expression
in
them
,
lean
forward
,
grasp
the
little
shoulder
,
and
say
in
a
quick
,
hoarse
whisper
    
"
a
curse
be
on
your
generation
,
child
.
<EOS>
They
will
open
the
mountain
and
drag
forth
the
golden
wing
and
coin
them
into
money
,
and
the
solemn
face
they
will
break
up
into
ear
-
ring
for
wanton
woman
!
<EOS>
and
they
shall
get
themselves
a
new
name
,
but
the
angel
of
ignominy
,
with
the
fiery
brand
,
shall
know
them
,
and
their
heart
shall
be
the
tomb
of
dead
desire
that
turn
their
life
to
rottenness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
aspect
and
action
of
Mordecai
be
so
new
and
mysterious
to
Jacob
 
<EOS>
they
carry
such
a
burden
of
obscure
threat
 
<EOS>
it
be
as
if
the
patient
,
indulgent
companion
have
turn
into
something
unknown
and
terrific
:
<EOS>
the
sunken
dark
eye
and
hoarse
accent
close
to
him
,
the
thin
grappling
finger
,
shake
Jacob
's
little
frame
into
awe
,
and
while
Mordecai
be
speak
he
stand
tremble
with
a
sense
that
the
house
be
tumble
in
and
they
be
not
go
to
have
dinner
any
more
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
terrible
speech
have
end
and
the
pinch
be
relax
,
the
shock
resolve
itself
into
tear
;
Jacob
lift
up
his
small
patriarchal
countenance
and
weep
aloud
.
<EOS>
this
sign
of
childish
grief
at
once
recall
Mordecai
to
his
usual
gentle
self
:
he
be
not
able
to
speak
again
at
present
,
but
with
a
maternal
action
he
draw
the
curly
head
toward
him
and
press
it
tenderly
against
his
breast
.
<EOS>
on
this
Jacob
,
feel
the
danger
well
-
nigh
over
,
howl
at
ease
,
begin
to
imitate
his
own
performance
and
improve
upon
it
 
a
sort
of
transition
from
impulse
into
art
often
observable
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
next
day
he
undertake
to
terrify
Adelaide
Rebekah
in
like
manner
,
and
succeed
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mordecai
suffer
a
check
which
last
long
,
from
the
consciousness
of
a
misapplied
agitation
;
sane
as
well
as
excitable
,
he
judge
severely
his
moment
of
aberration
into
futile
eagerness
,
and
feel
discredit
with
himself
.
<EOS>
all
the
more
his
mind
be
strain
toward
the
discernment
of
that
friend
to
come
,
with
whom
he
would
have
a
calm
certainty
of
fellowship
and
understanding
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
just
then
that
,
in
his
usual
midday
guardianship
of
the
old
book
-
shop
,
he
be
strike
by
the
appearance
of
Deronda
,
and
it
be
perhaps
comprehensible
now
why
Mordecai
's
glance
take
on
a
sudden
eager
interest
as
he
look
at
the
new
-
comer
:
he
see
a
face
and
frame
which
seem
to
him
to
realize
the
long
-
conceive
type
.
<EOS>
but
the
disclaimer
of
jewish
birth
be
for
the
moment
a
backward
thrust
of
double
severity
,
the
particular
disappointment
tend
to
shake
his
confidence
in
the
more
indefinite
expectation
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
when
he
find
Deronda
seat
at
the
Cohens
'
table
,
the
disclaimer
be
for
the
moment
nullify
:
the
first
impression
return
with
add
force
,
seem
to
be
guarantee
by
this
second
meeting
under
circumstance
more
peculiar
than
the
former
;
and
in
ask
Deronda
if
he
know
Hebrew
,
Mordecai
be
so
possess
by
the
new
inrush
of
belief
,
that
he
have
forget
the
absence
of
any
other
condition
to
the
fulfillment
of
his
hope
.
<EOS>
but
the
answering
"
no
"
strike
them
all
down
again
,
and
the
frustration
be
more
painful
than
before
.
<EOS>
after
turn
his
back
on
the
visitor
that
Sabbath
evening
,
Mordecai
go
through
day
of
a
deep
discouragement
,
like
that
of
man
on
a
doom
ship
,
who
have
strain
their
eye
after
a
sail
,
and
beheld
it
with
rejoice
,
behold
it
never
advance
,
and
say
,
"
Our
sick
eye
make
it
.
"
<EOS>
but
the
long
-
contemplate
figure
have
come
as
an
emotional
sequence
of
Mordecai
's
firm
theoretic
conviction
;
it
have
be
work
from
the
imagery
of
his
most
passionate
life
;
and
it
inevitably
reappear
 
reappear
in
a
more
specific
self
-
assert
form
than
ever
.
<EOS>
Deronda
have
that
sort
of
resemblance
to
the
preconceived
type
which
a
finely
individual
bust
or
portrait
have
to
the
more
generalize
copy
leave
in
our
mind
after
a
long
interval
:
we
renew
our
memory
with
delight
,
but
we
hardly
know
with
how
much
correction
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
his
face
meet
Mordecai
's
inward
gaze
as
it
have
always
belong
to
the
await
friend
,
ray
out
,
moreover
<EOS>
,
some
of
that
influence
which
belong
to
breathe
flesh
;
till
by
-
and
-
by
it
seem
that
discouragement
have
turn
into
a
new
obstinacy
of
resistance
,
and
the
ever
-
recurrent
vision
have
the
force
of
an
outward
call
to
disregard
counter
-
evidence
,
and
keep
expectation
awake
.
<EOS>
It
be
Deronda
now
who
be
see
in
the
often
painful
night
-
watch
,
when
we
be
all
liable
to
be
hold
with
the
clutch
of
a
single
thought
 
whose
figure
,
never
with
its
back
turned
,
be
see
in
moment
of
soothe
reverie
or
soothe
doze
,
paint
on
that
golden
sky
which
be
the
doubly
bless
symbol
of
advance
day
and
of
approach
rest
.
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
know
that
the
nameless
stranger
be
to
come
and
redeem
his
ring
;
and
,
in
spite
of
contrary
chance
,
the
wish
to
see
him
again
be
grow
into
a
belief
that
he
should
see
him
.
<EOS>
in
the
January
week
,
he
feel
an
increase
agitation
of
that
subdue
hide
quality
which
hinder
nervous
people
from
any
steady
occupation
on
the
eve
of
an
anticipated
change
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
go
on
with
his
printing
of
Hebrew
on
little
Jacob
's
mind
;
or
with
his
attendance
at
a
weekly
club
,
which
be
another
effort
of
the
same
forlorn
hope
:
something
else
be
come
.
<EOS>
the
one
thing
he
long
for
be
to
get
as
far
as
the
river
,
which
he
could
do
but
seldom
and
with
difficulty
.
<EOS>
He
yearn
with
a
poet
's
yearning
for
the
wide
sky
,
the
far
-
reach
vista
of
bridge
,
the
tender
and
fluctuate
light
on
the
water
which
seem
to
breathe
with
a
life
that
can
shiver
and
mourn
,
be
comfort
and
rejoice

quite

tall

even
in

with

see

_

<EOS>
even
embarrassment
could
hardly
have
make
the
"
little

"
awkward
,
but
quick
in
her
perception
she
be
at
once
aware
of
the
situation

and
feel
well
satisfied
that
the
great
personage
have
come
to
Mirah
instead
of
require
her
to
come
to
him
;
take
it
as
a
sign
of
active
interest
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
enter
,
the
room
shrink
into
closet
,
the
cottage
piano
,
Mab
think
,
seem
a
ridiculous
toy
,
and
the
entire
family
existence
as
petty
and
private
as
an
establishment
of
mouse
in
the
Tuileries
.
<EOS>
Klesmer
's
personality
,
especially
his
way
of
glance
round
him
,
immediately
suggest
vast
area
and
a
multitudinous
audience
,
and
probably
they
make
the
usual
scenery
of
his
consciousness
,
for
we
all
of
us
carry
on
our
thinking
in
some
habitual
locus
where
there
be
a
presence
of
other
soul
,
and
those
who
take
in
a
large
sweep
than
their
neighbor
be
apt
to
seem
mightily
vain
and
affected
.
<EOS>
Klesmer
be
vain
,
but
not
more
so
than
many
contemporary
of
heavy
aspect
,
whose
vanity
leap

and
startle
one
like
a
spear
out
of
a
walking

stick
;
as
to
his
carriage
and
gesture
,
these
be
as
natural
to
him
as
the
length
of
his
finger
;
and
the
rank
affectation
he
could
have
show
would
have
be
to
look
diffident
and
demure
.
<EOS>
while
his
grandiose
air
be
make
Mab
feel
herself
a
ridiculous
toy
to
match
the
cottage
piano

he
be
take
in
the
detail
around
him
with
a
keen
and
thoroughly
kind
sensibility

<EOS>
He
remember
a
home
no

this
on
the
outskirt
of
Bohemia

and
in
the
figurative
Bohemia
too
he
have
have
large
acquaintance
with
the
variety
and
romance
which
belong
to
small
income

<EOS>
He
address
Mrs.

"

Our

<EOS>
Klesmer

but
,
with
subtle
politeness
,
he
look
round
bowingly
at
the
three
sister
as
if
he
be
uncertain
which
be
the
young

<EOS>
"

Klesmer

in

gratified
expectation

turn
a
radiant

who
,
instead
of
be
in
the
least
take
by
surprise
,
have
a
calm
pleasure
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
She
like
the
look
of
Klesmer
,
feel
sure
that
he
would
scold
her
,
like
a
great
musician
and
a
kind
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not

"
I

It

Shall

Klesmer

himself
,
at
Mrs.

where
he
could
have
a
good
view
of
the
singer

<EOS>
the
acute
little
mother
would
not
have
acknowledge
the
weakness
,
but
she
really
say
to
herself
,
"
He

like
her

her

"
  
<EOS>
all
the
feminine
heart
except
Mirah

be
beat
fast
with
anxiety
,
think
Klesmer
terrific
as
he
sit
with
his
listening
frown
on
,
and
only
daring
to
look
at
him
furtively
.
<EOS>
if
he
do
say
anything
severe
<EOS>
it
would
be
so
hard
for
them
all

<EOS>
They
could
only
comfort
themselves
with
think
that
Prince
Camaralzaman
,
who
have
hear
the
fine
thing
,
prefer
Mirah
's
singing
to
any
other
:
 
also
she
appear
to
be
do
her
very
good
,
as
if
she
be
more
instead
of
less
at
ease
than
usual
.
  
<EOS>
the
song
she
have
choose
be
a
fine
setting
of
some
word
select
from
Leopardi
's
grand
Ode
to
Italy
:
      
<EOS>
"
_

a
rhythmic

after

come
a
climax
of
devout
triumph

from
the
subdued
adoration
of
a

,
while
he
go
on
with
a
smothered
articulation
quite
unintelligible
to
the
audience

<EOS>
the
three
girl
detest
him
unanimously
for
not
say
one
word
of
praise

<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
be
a
little
alarmed
.
  
<EOS>
Mirah
,
simply
bent
on
do
what
Klesmer
desire
,
and
imagine
that
he
would
now
like
to
hear
her
sing
some
German
,
go
through
Prince
Radzivill
's
music
to
Gretchen
's
song
in
the
"
Faust
,
"
one
after
the
other
without
any
interrogatory
pause
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
finish
he
rise
and
walk
to
the
extremity
of
the
small
space
at
command
,
then
walk
back
to
the
piano
,
where
Mirah
have
rise
from
her
seat
and
stand
look
toward
him
with
her
little
hand
cross
before
her
,
meekly
await
judgment
;
then
with
a
sudden
unknitting
of
his
brow
and
with
beam
eye
,
he
stretch
out
his
hand
and
say
abruptly
,
"
let
us
shake
hand
:
you
be
a
musician
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mab
feel
herself
begin
to
cry
,
and
all
the
three
girl
hold
Klesmer
adorable
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
take
a
long
breath
.
  
<EOS>
but
straightway
the
frown
come
again
,
the
long
hand
,
back
uppermost
,
be
stretch
out
in
quite
a
different
sense
to
touch
with
finger
-
tip
the
back
of
Mirah
's
,
and
with
protrude
lip
he
say
    
"
not
for
great
task
.
<EOS>
no
high
roof

<EOS>
We
be
no
skylark
.
<EOS>
We
must
be
modest

"
<EOS>
Klesmer
pause
here
.
<EOS>
and
Mab
cease
to
think
him
adorable
:
"
as
if
Mirah
have
show
the
least
sign
of
conceit
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
be
silent
,
know
that
there
be
a
specific
opinion
to
be
wait
for
,
and
Klesmer
presently
go
on
 
"
<EOS>
I
would
not
advise
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
further
your
singing
in
any
large
space
than
a
private
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
but
you
will
do
there
.
<EOS>
and
here
in
London
that
be
one
of
the
good
career
open
.
<EOS>
lesson
will
follow
.
<EOS>
Will
you
come
and
sing
at
a
private
concert
at
my
house
on
Wednesday
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
shall
be
grateful
,
"
say
Mirah
,
put
her
hand
together
devoutly
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
get
my
bread
in
that
way
than
by
anything
more
public
.
<EOS>
I
will
try
to
improve
.
<EOS>
what
should
I
work
at
most
?
"
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
make
a
preliminary
answer
in
noise
which
sound
like
word
bite
in
two
and
swallow
before
they
be
half
out
,
shake
his
finger
the
while
,
before
he
say
,
quite
distinctly
,
"
I
shall
introduce
you
to
Astorga
:
he
be
the
foster
-
father
of
good
singing
and
will
give
you
advice
.
"
<EOS>
then
address
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
he
add
,
"
Mrs.
Klesmer
will
call
before
Wednesday
,
with
your
permission
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
feel
that
to
be
a
great
kindness
,
"
say
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
sing
to
her
,
"
say
Klesmer
,
turn
again
to
Mirah
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
a
thorough
musician
,
and
have
a
soul
with
more
ear
to
it
than
you
will
often
get
in
a
musician
.
<EOS>
Your
singing
will
satisfy
her
:
      
<EOS>
"
Vor
den
Wissenden
sich
stellen
;
"
  
you
know
the
rest
?
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
"
"
Sicher
ist
be
in
alien
Fällen
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
say
Mirah
,
promptly
.
<EOS>
and
Klesmer
say
"
Schön
!
<EOS>
"
put
out
his
hand
again
as
a
good
-
bye
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
certainly
choose
the
most
delicate
way
of
praise
Mirah
,
and
the
meyrick
girl
have
now
give
him
all
their
esteem
.
<EOS>
but
imagine
Mab
's
feeling
when
suddenly
fix
his
eye
on
her
,
he
say
decisively
,
"
that
young
lady
be
musical
,
I
see
!
"
<EOS>
She
be
a
mere
blush
and
sense
of
scorch
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Mirah
,
on
her
behalf
.
"
<EOS>
and
she
have
a
touch
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
please
,
Mirah
 
a
scramble
,
not
a
touch
,
"
say
Mab
,
in
anguish
,
with
a
horrible
fear
of
what
the
next
thing
may
be
:
this
dreadful
divining
personage
 
evidently
Satan
in
gray
trouser
 
may
order
her
to
sit
down
to
the
piano
,
and
her
heart
be
like
molten
wax
in
the
midst
of
her
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
cheap
payment
for
her
amazed
joy
when
Klesmer
say
benignantly
,
turn
to
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
"
Will
she
like
to
accompany
Miss
Lapidoth
and
hear
the
music
on
Wednesday
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
could
hardly
be
a
great
pleasure
for
her
,
"
say
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
"
She
will
be
most
glad
and
grateful
.
"
  
<EOS>
Thereupon
Klesmer
bow
round
to
the
three
sister
more
grandly
than
they
have
ever
be
bow
to
before
.
<EOS>
altogether
it
be
an
amusing
picture
 
<EOS>
the
little
room
with
so
much
of
its
diagonal
take
up
in
Klesmer
's
magnificent
bend
to
the
small
feminine
figure
like
image
a
little
less
than
life
-
size
,
the
grave
Holbein
face
on
the
wall
,
as
many
as
be
not
otherwise
occupy
,
look
hard
at
this
stranger
who
by
his
face
seem
a
dignified
contemporary
of
their
own
,
but
whose
garment
seem
a
deplorable
mockery
of
the
human
form
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
could
not
help
go
out
of
the
room
with
Klesmer
and
close
the
door
behind
her
.
<EOS>
He
understand
her
,
and
say
with
a
frown
nod
    
<EOS>
"
She
will
do
:
if
she
do
not
attempt
too
much
and
her
voice
hold
out
,
she
can
make
an
income
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
be
the
great
point
:
Deronda
tell
me
.
<EOS>
You
be
take
care
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
look
like
a
good
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
an
angel
,
"
say
the
warm
-
hearted
woman
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Klesmer
,
with
a
playful
nod
;
"
she
be
a
pretty
Jewess
<EOS>
:
the
angel
must
not
get
the
credit
of
her
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
she
have
find
a
guardian
angel
,
"
he
end
,
bow
himself
out
in
this
amiable
way
.
  
<EOS>
the
four
young
creature
have
look
at
each
other
mutely
till
the
door
bang
and
Mrs.
Meyrick
re
-
enter
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
an
explosion
.
<EOS>
Mab
clap
her
hand
and
dance
everywhere
inconveniently
;
Mrs.
Meyrick
kiss
Mirah
and
bless
her
;
Amy
say
emphatically
,
"
We
can
never
get
her
a
new
dress
before
Wednesday

"
<EOS>
and
Kate
exclaim
,
"
thank
heaven
<EOS>
my
table

not

"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
have
reseat
herself
on
the
music

stool
without
speak
,
and
the
tear
be
roll
down
her
cheek
as
she
look
at
her
friend

<EOS>
"

Mrs.

<EOS>
"
yes

say
Mab

cordially

come
back
to
her
low
seat

caress
her
knee

<EOS>
"
I
be
begin

<EOS>
"
I

I

<EOS>
"
yes

at

say
Mab

sharply

<EOS>

but
he
may
have
say
something
encourage
sooner

<EOS>
I
think
him
dreadfully
ugly
when
he
sit
frown
,
and
only
say
,

_
con_tinue

<EOS>
"
I
hate
him
all
the
long

the
top
of
his

the
toe

Mab

he

Kate

<EOS>
"

now

not

I
can
not
bear
people

keep
their

bottle
up
for
the

off

They

make

however

I
forgive
him
everything

say
Mab
,
with
a
magnanimous
air
,
"
but
he
have
invite
me
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
why
he
fix
on
me
as
the
musical
one
?
<EOS>
be
it
because
I
have
a
bulging
forehead
,
ma
,
and
peep
from
under
it

It

your

<EOS>
He

upon
it

what
be
that
german

<EOS>
you

her

break
into
an
amused
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
say
it
so
many
time
for
a
lesson

<EOS>
It
mean
that
it
be
safe
to
do
anything
 
singing

anything
else

those

all
about

She

You

<EOS>
"
I

Mrs.

,
just
as
her
boy

.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
han
,
we
want
your
opinion
about
Mirah
's
dress

<EOS>

great
event
have
happen
.
<EOS>
Klesmer
have
be
here
,
and
she

go
to
sing
at
his
house
on
Wednesday
among
grand
people

<EOS>
She
think
this
dress
will
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
see
,
"
say
Hans
.
<EOS>
Mirah
in
her
childlike
way
turn
toward
him
to
be
look
at
;
and
he
,
go
to
a
little
further
distance
,
knelt
with
one
knee
on
a
hassock
to
survey
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
would
be
think
a
very
good
stage
-
dress
for
me
,
"
she
say
,
pleadingly
,
"
in
a
part
where
I
be
to
come
on
as
a
poor
Jewess
and
sing
to
fashionable
Christians
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
effective
,
"
say
Hans
,
with
a
consider
air
;
"
it
would
stand
out
well
among
the
fashionable
_
chiffon
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
ought
not
to
claim
all
the
poverty
on
your
side
,
Mirah
,
"
say
Amy
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
plenty
of
poor
Christians
and
dreadfully
rich
Jews
and
fashionable
Jewesses
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
any
harm
,
"
say
Mirah
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
only
I
have
be
use
to
think
about
my
dress
for
part
in
play
.
<EOS>
and
I
almost
always
have
a
part
with
a
plain
dress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
make
me
think
it
questionable
,
"
say
Hans
,
who
have
suddenly
become
as
fastidious
and
conventional
on
this
occasion
as
he
have
think
Deronda
be
,
apropos
of
the
Berenice
-
picture
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
look
a
little
too
theatrical
.
<EOS>
We
must
not
make
you
a
_
rôle
_
of
the
poor
<EOS>
Jewess
 
or
of
be
a
Jewess
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hans
have
a
secret
desire
to
neutralize
the
Jewess
in
private
life
,
which
he
be
in
danger
of
not
keep
secret
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
what
I
be
really
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
pretend
anything
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
be
anything
else
,
"
say
Mirah
.
<EOS>
"
I
always
feel
myself
a
Jewess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
we
can
not
feel
that
about
you
,
"
say
Hans
,
with
a
devout
look
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
it
signify
whether
a
perfect
woman
be
a
Jewess
or
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
your
kind
way
of
praise
me
;
I
never
be
praise
so
before
,
"
say
Mirah
,
with
a
smile
,
which
be
rather
madden
to
Hans
and
make
him
feel
still
more
of
a
cosmopolitan
.
  
<EOS>
"
People
do
not
think
of
me
as
a
british
Christian
,
"
he
say
,
his
face
crease
merrily
.
<EOS>
"
They
think
of
me
as
an
imperfectly
handsome
young
man
and
an
unpromising
painter
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
be
wander
from
the
dress
,
"
say
Amy
.
<EOS>
"
if
that
will
not
do
,
how
be
we
to
get
another
before
Wednesday

morrow
Sunday

"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
this
will
do

Mirah

entreatingly
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
real
,
you
know
,
"
here
she
look
at
Hans
 
"
even
if
it
seem
theatrical
.
<EOS>
poor
Berenice
sit
on
the
ruin
 
any
one
may
say
that
be
theatrical
,
but
I
know
that
this
be
just
what
she
would
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
a
scoundrel

Hans

overcome
by
this
misplace

my
invention

so
before

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
"
say
Mirah
,
after
a
momentary
pause
of
surprise

<EOS>
"
You
know
it
be
what
she
would
be
sure
to
do
 
a

do

penitent

She
could
have
no
joy

to
afflict
herself
;
and
where
else
would
she
go
?
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
very
beautiful
that
you
should
enter
so
into
what
a
Jewess
would
feel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
Jewesses
of
that
time

on

Hans
,

up
with
a
sense

checkmate

that
make

convenient
for

but
the
dress

be
it
settle

<EOS>
"
yes

doubtfully
at
Mrs.

who
in
her
turn

up
at
her
son

,
"
what
do
you

Hans

<EOS>
"
  
"
that

will
not

Hans

decisively
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
not
go

You
must
jump
into
a
cab
with
her

little
mother

and
go
to
Regent
Street

<EOS>
It
be
plenty
of
time
to
get
anything
you
like
 
a
black
silk
dress
such
as
lady
wear

<EOS>
She
must
not

She
have
talent

<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
what
Mr.

for
her
to
have
a
handsome
dress

Mrs.

turn
on
his
heel
,
go
to

table

take
up
one
of

drawing
as
if

Should
not

a
study
of
Klesmer

at

down
perpendicularly

then
in
another
instant

wheel
round
on

look
at

half
timidly
 
<EOS>

still

with

_
Excursion
_

B.

.
   
<EOS>
Deronda
come
out
of
the
narrow
house
at
Chelsea
in
a
frame
of
mind
that
make
him
long
for
some
good
bodily
exercise
to
carry
off
what
he
be
himself
inclined
to
call
the
fume
of
his
temper
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
toward
the
city
,
and
the
sight
of
the
Chelsea
Stairs
with
the
wait
boat
at
once
determine
him
to
avoid
the
irritate
inaction
of
be
drive
in
a
cab
,
by
call
a
wherry
and
take
an
oar
.
  
<EOS>
His
errand
be
to
go
to
Ram
's
book
-
shop
,
where
he
have
yesterday
arrive
too
late
for
Mordecai
's
midday
watch
,
and
have
be
tell
that
he
invariably
come
there
again
between
five
and
six
.
<EOS>
some
further
acquaintance
with
this
remarkable
inmate
of
the
Cohens
be
particularly
desire
by
Deronda
as
a
preliminary
to
redeem
his
ring
:
he
wish
that
their
conversation
should
not
again
end
speedily
with
that
drop
of
Mordecai
's
interest
which
be
like
the
removal
of
a
drawbridge
,
and
threaten
to
shut
out
any
easy
communication
in
future
.
<EOS>
as
he
get
warm
with
the
use
of
the
oar
,
fix
his
mind
on
the
errand
before
him
and
the
end
he
want
to
achieve
on
Mirah
's
account
,
he
experience
,
as
be
will
not
with
him
,
a
quick
change
of
mental
light
,
shift
his
point
of
view
to
that
of
the
person
whom
he
have
be
think
of
hitherto
chiefly
as
serviceable
to
his
own
purpose
,
and
be
incline
to
taunt
himself
with
be
not
much
well
than
an
enlist
sergeant
,
who
never
trouble
himself
with
the
drama
that
bring
him
the
needful
recruit
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
if
I
get
from
this
man
the
information
I
be
most
anxious
about
,
"
think
Deronda
,
"
I
should
be
content
enough
if
he
feel
no
disposition
to
tell
me
more
of
himself
,
or
why
he
seem
to
have
some
expectation
from
me
which
be
disappoint
.
<EOS>
the
sort
of
curiosity
he
stir
would
die
out
;
and
yet
it
may
be
that
he
have
near
and
part
as
one
can
imagine
two
ship
do
,
each
freight
with
an
exile
who
would
have
recognize
the
other
if
the
two
could
have
look
out
face
to
face
.
<EOS>
not
that
there
be
any
likelihood
of
a
peculiar
tie
between
me
and
this
poor
fellow
,
whose
voyage
,
I
fancy
,
must
soon
be
over
.
<EOS>
but
I
wonder
whether
there
be
much
of
that
momentous
mutual
missing
between
people
who
interchange
blank
look
,
or
even
long
for
one
another
's
absence
in
a
crowded
place
.
<EOS>
however
,
one
make
one
's
self
chance
of
miss
by
go
on
the
recruiting
sergeant
's
plan
.
<EOS>
"
  
when
the
wherry
be
approach
Blackfriars
Bridge
,
where
Deronda
mean
to
land
,
it
be
half
-
past
four
,
and
the
gray
day
be
die
gloriously
,
its
western
cloud
all
break
into
narrow
purple
strata
before
a
wide
-
spread
saffron
clearness
,
which
in
the
sky
have
a
monumental
calm
,
but
on
the
river
,
with
its
change
object
,
be
reflect
as
a
luminous
movement
,
the
alternate
flash
of
ripple
or
current
,
the
sudden
glow
of
the
brown
sail
,
the
passage
of
laden
barge
from
blackness
into
color
,
make
an
active
response
to
that
brood
glory
.
  
<EOS>
feel
well
heat
by
this
time
,
Deronda
give
up
the
oar
and
draw
over
him
again
his
Inverness
cape
.
<EOS>
as
he
lift
up
his
head
while
fasten
the
topmost
button
his
eye
catch
a
well
-
remember
face
look
toward
him
over
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
 
bring
out
by
the
western
light
into
startle
distinctness
and
brilliancy
 
an
illuminate
type
of
bodily
emaciation
and
spiritual
eagerness
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
face
of
Mordecai
,
who
also
,
in
his
watch
toward
the
west
,
have
catch
sight
of
the
advance
boat
,
and
have
keep
it
fast
within
his
gaze
,
at
first
simply
because
it
be
advance
,
then
with
a
recovery
of
impression
that
make
him
quiver
as
with
a
presentiment
,
till
at
last
the
nearing
figure
lift
up
its
face
toward
him
 
the
face
of
his
vision
 
and
then
immediately
,
with
white
uplifted
hand
,
beckon
again
and
again
.
  
<EOS>
for
Deronda
,
anxious
that
Mordecai
should
recognize
and
await
him
,
have
lose
no
time
before
signal
,
and
the
answer
come
straightway
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
lift
his
cap
and
wave
it
 
feel
in
that
moment
that
his
inward
prophecy
be
fulfil

<EOS>
obstacle

incongruity

all
melt
into
the
sense
of
completion
with
which
his
soul
be
flood
by
this
outward
satisfaction
of
his
longing

His
exultation
be
not
widely
different
from
that
of
the
experimenter
,
bend
over
the
first
stirring
of
change
that
correspond
to
what
in
the
fervor
of
concentrated
prevision
his
thought
have
foreshadow
.
<EOS>
the
prefigured
friend
have
come
from
the
golden
background
,
and
have
signal
to
him
:
<EOS>
this
actually
be
:
the
rest

<EOS>
in
three
minute
Deronda
have
land

have
pay
his
boatman

for
him

perhaps
they
mention
it
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Mordecai
;
"
that
be
the
reason
I
come
to
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
answer
,
make
with
simple
gravity
,
be
startlingly
mysterious
to
Deronda
.
<EOS>
be
the
peculiarity
of
this
man
really
associate
with
any
sort
of
mental
alienation
,
accord
to
Cohen
's
hint
?
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
nothing
of
my
being
at
Chelsea
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
after
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
<EOS>
but
I
expect
you
to
come
down
the
river
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
wait
for
you
these
five
year

Mordecai
's
deep
-
sink
eye
be
fix
on
those
of
the
friend
who
have
at
last
arrive
with
a
look
of
affectionate
dependence
,
at
once
pathetic
and
solemn
.
<EOS>
Deronda
's
sensitiveness
be
not
the
less
responsive
because
he
could
not
but
believe
that
this
strangely
-
disclose
relation
be
found
on
an
illusion
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
a
satisfaction
to
me
if
I
can
be
of
any
real
use
to
you
,
"
he
answer
,
very
earnestly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
we
get
into
a
cab
and
drive
to
 
wherever
you
wish
to
go
?
<EOS>
You
have
probably
have
walk
enough
with
your
short
breath
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
us
go
to
the
book
-
shop
.
<EOS>
It
will
soon
be
time
for
me
to
be
there
.
<EOS>
but
now
look
up
the
river
,
"
say
Mordecai
,
turn
again
toward
it
and
speak
in
undertone
of
what
may
be
call
an
excited
calm
 
so
absorb
by
a
sense
of
fulfillment
that
he
be
conscious
of
no
barrier
to
a
complete
understanding
between
him
and
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
see
the
sky
,
how
it
be
slowly
fade
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
love
this
bridge
:
I
stand
on
it
when
I
be
a
little
boy
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
meeting
-
place
for
the
spiritual
messenger
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
 
what
the
Masters
say
 
that
each
order
of
thing
have
its
angel
:
that
mean
the
full
message
of
each
from
what
be
afar
.
<EOS>
here
I
have
listen
to
the
message
of
earth
and
sky
;
when
I
be
strong
I
use
to
stay
and
watch
for
the
star
in
the
deep
heaven
.
<EOS>
but
this
time
just
about
sunset
be
always
what
I
love
best
.
<EOS>
It
have
sink
into
me
and
dwelt
with
me
 
<EOS>
fading
,
slowly
fade
:
it
be
my
own
decline
:
it
pause
 
<EOS>
it
wait
,
till
at
last
it
bring
me
my
new
life
 
<EOS>
my
new
self
 
who
will
live
when
this
breath
be
all
breathe
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
do
not
speak
.
<EOS>
He
feel
himself
strangely
work
upon
.
<EOS>
the
first
-
prompt
suspicion
that
Mordecai
may
be
liable
to
hallucination
of
thought
 
may
have
become
a
monomaniac
on
some
subject
which
have
give
too
severe
a
strain
to
his
disease
organism
 
give
way
to
a
more
submissive
expectancy
.
<EOS>
His
nature
be
too
large
,
too
ready
to
conceive
region
beyond
his
own
experience
,
to
rest
at
once
in
the
easy
explanation
,
"
madness
,
"
whenever
a
consciousness
show
some
fullness
and
conviction
where
his
own
be
blank
.
<EOS>
It
accord
with
his
habitual
disposition
that
he
should
meet
rather
than
resist
any
claim
on
him
in
the
shape
of
another
's
need
;
and
this
claim
bring
with
it
a
sense
of
solemnity
which
seem
a
radiation
from
Mordecai
,
as
utterly
nullify
his
outward
poverty
and
lift
him
into
authority
as
if
he
have
be
that
preternatural
guide
see
in
the
universal
legend
,
who
suddenly
drop
his
mean
disguise
and
stand
a
manifest
power
.
<EOS>
that
impression
be
the
more
sanction
by
a
sort
of
resolve
quietude
which
the
persuasion
of
fulfillment
have
produce
in
Mordecai
's
manner
.
<EOS>
after
they
have
stand
a
moment
in
silence
he
say
,
"
let
us
go
now
,
"
and
when
they
be
ride
he
add
,
"
We
will
get
down
at
the
end
of
the
street
and
walk
to
the
shop
.
<EOS>
You
can
look
at
the
book
,
and
Mr.
Ram
will
be
go
away
directly
and
leave
us
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
seem
that
this
enthusiast
be
just
as
cautious
,
just
as
much
alive
to
judgment
in
other
mind
as
if
he
have
be
that
antipode
of
all
enthusiasm
call
"
a
man
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
while
they
be
rattle
along
in
the
cab
,
Mirah
be
still
present
with
Deronda
in
the
midst
of
this
strange
experience
,
but
he
foresee
that
the
course
of
conversation
would
be
determine
by
Mordecai
,
not
by
himself
:
<EOS>
he
be
no
longer
confident
what
question
he
should
be
able
to
ask
;
and
with
a
reaction
on
his
own
mood
,
he
inwardly
say
,
"
I
suppose
I
be
in
a
state
of
complete
superstition
,
just
as
if
I
be
await
the
destiny
that
could
interpret
the
oracle
.
<EOS>
but
some
strong
relation
there
must
be
between
me
and
this
man
,
since
he
feel
it
strongly
.
<EOS>
Great
heaven
!
<EOS>
what
relation
have
prove
itself
more
potent
in
the
world
than
faith
even
when
mistaken
 
than
expectation
even
when
perpetually
disappointed
?
<EOS>
be
my
side
of
the
relation
to
be
disappointing
or
fulfilling
?
 
<EOS>
well
,
if
it
be
ever
possible
for
me
to
fulfill
I
will
not
disappoint
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
ten
minute
the
two
man
,
with
as
intense
a
consciousness
as
if
they
have
be
two
undeclared
lover
,
feel
themselves
alone
in
the
small
gas
-
light
book
-
shop
and
turn
face
to
face
,
each
bare
his
head
from
an
instinctive
feeling
that
they
wish
to
see
each
other
fully
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
come
forward
to
lean
his
back
against
the
little
counter
,
while
Deronda
stand
against
the
opposite
wall
hardly
more
than
four
foot
off
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
perpetuate
those
two
face
,
as
Titian
's
"
Tribute
money
"
have
perpetuate
two
type
present
another
sort
of
contrast
.
<EOS>
imagine
 
we
all
of
us
<EOS>
can
 
the
pathetic
stamp
of
consumption
with
its
brilliancy
of
glance
to
which
the
sharply
-
define
structure
of
feature
remind
one
of
a
forsaken
temple
,
give
already
a
far
-
off
look
as
of
one
get
unwillingly
out
of
reach
;
and
imagine
it
on
a
jewish
face
naturally
accentuate
for
the
expression
of
an
eager
mind
 
the
face
of
a
man
little
above
thirty
,
but
with
that
age
upon
it
which
belong
to
time
lengthen
by
suffer
,
the
hair
and
beard
,
still
black
,
throw
out
the
yellow
pallor
of
the
skin
,
the
difficult
breathing
give
more
decide
marking
to
the
mobile
nostril
,
the
waste
yellow
hand
conspicuous
on
the
fold
arm
:
then
give
to
the
yearning
consumptive
glance
something
of
the
slowly
die
mother
's
look
,
when
her
one
love
son
visit
her
bedside
,
and
the
flicker
power
of
gladness
leap
out
as
she
say
,
"
My
boy
!
"
 
<EOS>
for
the
sense
of
spiritual
perpetuation
in
another
resemble
that
maternal
transference
of
self
.
  
<EOS>
see
such
a
portrait
you
would
see
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
and
opposite
to
him
be
a
face
not
more
distinctively
oriental
than
many
a
type
see
among
what
we
call
the
latin
race
;
rich
in
youthful
health
,
and
with
a
forcible
masculine
gravity
in
its
repose
,
that
give
the
value
of
judgment
to
the
reverence
with
which
he
meet
the
gaze
of
this
mysterious
son
of
poverty
who
claim
him
as
a
long
-
expect
friend
.
<EOS>
the
more
exquisite
quality
of
Deronda
's
nature
 
that
keenly
perceptive
sympathetic
emotiveness
which
run
along
with
his
speculative
tendency
 
be
never
more
thoroughly
test
.
<EOS>
He
feel
nothing
that
could
be
call
belief
in
the
validity
of
Mordecai
's
impression
concern
him
or
in
the
probability
of
any
greatly
effective
issue
:
what
he
feel
be
a
profound
sensibility
to
a
cry
from
the
depth
of
another
and
accompany
that
,
the
summon
to
be
receptive
instead
of
superciliously
prejudge
.
<EOS>
receptiveness
be
a
rare
and
massive
power
,
like
fortitude
;
and
this
state
of
mind
now
give
Deronda
's
face
its
utmost
expression
of
calm
benignant
force
 
an
expression
which
nourish
Mordecai
's
confidence
and
make
an
open
way
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
begin
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
know
what
have
guide
me
to
you
and
bring
us
together
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
You
be
wonder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
impatient
,
"
say
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
ready
to
listen
to
whatever
you
may
wish
to
disclose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
some
of
the
reason
why
I
need
you
,
"
say
Mordecai
,
speak
quietly
,
as
if
he
wish
to
reserve
his
strength
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
that
I
be
die
.
<EOS>
You
see
that
I
be
as
one
shut
up
behind
bar
by
the
wayside
,
who
if
he
speak
to
any
would
be
meet
only
by
head
-
shaking
and
pity
.
<EOS>
the
day
be
close
 
the
light
be
fade
 
<EOS>
soon
we
should
not
have
be
able
to
discern
each
other
.
<EOS>
but
you
have
come
in
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
rejoice
that
I
be
come
in
time
,
"
say
Deronda
,
feelingly
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
say
,
"
I
hope
you
be
not
mistaken
in
me
,
"
 
the
very
word
"
mistaken
,
"
he
think
,
would
be
a
cruelty
at
that
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
the
hide
reason
why
I
need
you
begin
afar
off
,
"
say
Mordecai
;
"
begin
in
my
early
year
when
I
be
study
in
another
land
.
<EOS>
then
idea
,
beloved
idea
,
come
to
me
,
because
I
be
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
They
be
a
trust
to
fulfill
,
because
I
be
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
They
be
an
inspiration
,
because
I
be
a
Jew
,
and
feel
the
heart
of
my
race
beat
within
me
.
<EOS>
They
be
my
life
;
I
be
not
fully
bear
till
then
.
<EOS>
I
count
this
heart
,
and
this
breath
,
and
this
right
hand
"
 
<EOS>
Mordecai
have
pathetically
press
his
hand
upon
his
breast
,
and
then
stretch
its
waste
finger
out
before
him
 
<EOS>
"
I
count
my
sleep
and
my
waking
,
and
the
work
I
feed
my
body
with
,
and
the
sight
that
feed
my
eye
 
I
count
them
<EOS>
but
as
fuel
to
the
divine
flame
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
do
as
one
who
wander
and
engrave
his
thought
in
rocky
solitude
,
and
before
I
could
change
my
course
come
care
and
labor
and
disease
,
and
block
the
way
before
me
,
and
bind
me
with
the
iron
that
eat
itself
into
the
soul
.
<EOS>
then
I
say
,
"
how
shall
I
save
the
life
within
me
from
be
stifle
with
this
stifle
breath
?
"
<EOS>
"
  
Mordecai
pause
to
rest
that
poor
breath
which
have
be
tax
by
the
rise
excitement
of
his
speech
.
<EOS>
and
also
he
wish
to
check
that
excitement
.
<EOS>
Deronda
dare
not
speak
the
very
silence
in
the
narrow
space
seem
alive
with
mingled
awe
and
compassion
before
this
struggle
fervor
.
<EOS>
and
presently
Mordecai
go
on
    
"
<EOS>
but
you
may
misunderstand
me
.
<EOS>
I
speak
not
as
an
ignorant
dreamer
 
as
one
breed
up
in
the
inland
valley
,
think
ancient
thought
anew
,
and
not
know
them
ancient
,
never
have
stand
by
the
great
water
where
the
world
's
knowledge
pass
to

fro

<EOS>
English
be
my
mother
-
tongue
,
England
be
the
native
land
of
this
body
,
which
be
<EOS>
but
as
a
breaking
pot
of
earth
around
the
fruit
-
bearing
tree
,
whose
seed
may
make
the
desert
rejoice

<EOS>
but
my
true
life
be
nourish
in
Holland
at
the
foot
of
my
mother
's
brother
,
a
Rabbi
skilled
in
special
learning
:
and
when
he
die
I
go
to
Hamburg
to
study
,
and
afterwards
to
Göttingen
,
that
I
may
take
a
large
outlook
on
my
people
,
and
on
the
Gentile
world
,
and
drank
knowledge
at
all
source

<EOS>
I
be
a
youth

I
feel
free
;
I
see
our
chief
seat
in
Germany

I
be
not
then
in
utter
poverty
.
<EOS>
and
I
have
possess
myself
of
a
handicraft
.
<EOS>
for
I
say
,
I
care
not
if
my
lot
be
as
that
of
Joshua
ben
Chananja
:
after
the
last
destruction
he
earn
his
bread
by
make
needle
,
but
in
his
youth
he
have
be
a
singer
on
the
step
of
the
Temple
,
and
have
a
memory
of
what
be
before
the
glory
depart
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
let
my
body
dwell
in
poverty
,
and
my
hand
be
as
the
hand
of
the
toiler
:
but
let
my
soul
be
as
a
temple
of
remembrance
where
the
treasure
of
knowledge
enter
and
the
inner
sanctuary
be
hope
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
choose

<EOS>
They
say
,
"
He
feed
himself
on
vision

and
I
deny
not
;
for
vision
be
the
creator
and
feeder
of

<EOS>
I
see

I
measure
the

which
the
vision
will
create
anew

<EOS>
You
be
not

to
one
who
rave
aloof
from
the
life

his

<EOS>
Mordecai
pause
,
and
Deronda
,
feel
that
the
pause
be
expectant
,
say
,
"
do
me
the
justice
to
believe
that

that
I
may

I

a

willingly

Mordecai
repeat
in

It

<EOS>
They
have
absorb
the
philosophy
of
the
Gentile
into
the
faith
of
the
Jew

they
still
yearn
toward
a

<EOS>
Mordecai
pause
again
,
and
then
say
in
a
loud
,
hoarse
whisper
    
"
while
it
be
imprison
in
me

it
will
never
learn
another

<EOS>
"
  
"
have
you
write
entirely
in
Hebrew
,
then
?
"
say
Deronda
,
remember
with
some
anxiety
the
former
question
as
to
his
own
knowledge
of
that
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
 
yes
,
"
say
Mordecai
,
in
a
tone
of
deep
sadness
:
"
in
my
youth
I
wander
toward
that
solitude
,
not
feel
that
it
be
a
solitude
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
rank
of
the
great
dead
around
me
;
the
martyr
gather
and
listen
.
<EOS>
but
soon
I
find
that
the
living
be
deaf
to
me
.
<EOS>
at
first
I
see
my
life
spread
as
a
long
future
:
I
say
part
of
my
jewish
heritage
be
an
unbreaking
patience
;
part
be
skill
to
seek
diver
method
and
find
a
rooting
-
place
where
the
planter
despair
.
<EOS>
but
there
come
new
messenger
from
the
Eternal
.
<EOS>
I
have
to
bow
under
the
yoke
that
press
on
the
great
multitude
bear
of
woman
:
<EOS>
family
trouble
call
me
 
I
have
to
work
,
to
care
,
not
for
myself
alone

<EOS>
I
be
leave
solitary
again
;
but
already
the
angel
of
death
have
turn
to
me
and
beckon
,
and
I
feel
his
skirt
continually
on
my
path
.
<EOS>
I
loose
not
my
effort

<EOS>
I
besought
hearing
and
help
.
<EOS>
I
speak
;
I
go
to
man
of
our
people
 
to
the
rich
in
influence
or
knowledge
,
to
the
rich
in
other
wealth
.
<EOS>
but
I
find
none
to
listen
with
understanding
.
<EOS>
I
be
rebuke
for
error
;
I
be
offer
a
small
sum
in
charity
.
<EOS>
no
wonder
.
<EOS>
I
look
poor
;
I
carry
a
bundle
of
hebrew
manuscript
with
me
;
I
say
,
our
chief
teacher
be
mislead
the
hope
of
our
race
.
<EOS>
scholar
and
merchant
be
both
too
busy
to
listen
.
<EOS>
Scorn
stand
as
interpreter
between
me
and
them
.
<EOS>
one
say
,
"
the
book
of
Mormon
would
never
have
answer
in
Hebrew

and
if
you
mean
to

our

it

not
likely
you
can
teach
them
anything

<EOS>
He
touch
a

there

"
  
<EOS>
the
last
word
have
a
perceptible
irony
in
their
hoarsened
tone

<EOS>
"
but
though
you
have
accustom
yourself
to
write
in
hebrew
,
few

surely

can
use
English
better
,
"
say
Deronda
,
want
to
hint
consolation
in
a
new
effort
for
which
he
could
smooth
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
shake
his
head
slowly
,
and
answer
    
"
too
late
 
too
late

<EOS>
I
can
write
no
more

<EOS>
My
writing
would
be
like
this
gasping
breath

<EOS>
but
the
breath
may
wake
the
fount
of
pity
 
<EOS>
the
writing
not

<EOS>
if
I
could
write
now
and
use
English

I
should
be
as
one
who
beat
a
board
to
summon
those
who
have
be

no

a
bell

<EOS>
My
soul
have
an
ear
to
hear
the
fault
of
its
own
speech

<EOS>
new
writing
of
mine
would
be
like

<EOS>
Mordecai
spread
his
arm
 
"
within
it
there
may
be
the
Ruach

the
breath

man

smile

<EOS>
Mordecai
let
his
hand
fall

and
his

sink
in
melancholy

for

he
have

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
I

Deronda

in

clear
deep
voice

be
itself
a
cordial
,
apart
from

forgive
me

hastily

"
 
<EOS>
Mordecai
have
take
a
step
nearer
as
he
speak
,
and
now
lay
his
hand
on
Deronda
's
arm
with
a
tight
grasp
;
his
face
little
more
than
a
foot
off
have
something
like
a
pale
flame
in
it
 
an
intensity
of
reliance
that
act
as
a
peremptory
claim

while
he
go
on
 
<EOS>
"
You

"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
have
become
as
pallid
as
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
quick
as
an
alarm
of
flood
or
fire
,
there
spread
within
him
not
only
a
compassionate
dread
of
discourage
this
fellowman
who
urge
a
prayer
as
one
in
the
last
agony
,
but
also
the
oppose
dread
of
fatally
feed
an
illusion
,
and
be
hurry
on
to
a
self
-
committal
which
may
turn
into
a
falsity
.
<EOS>
the
peculiar
appeal
to
his
tenderness
overcome
the
repulsion
that
most
of
us
experience
under
a
grasp
and
speech
which
assume
to
dominate
.
<EOS>
the
difficulty
to
him
be
to
inflict
the
accent
of
hesitation
and
doubt
on
this
ardent
suffering
creature
,
who
be
crowd
too
much
of
his
brief
be
into
a
moment
of
perhaps
extravagant
trust
.
<EOS>
with
exquisite
instinct
,
Deronda
,
before
he
open
his
lip
,
place
his
palm
gently
on
Mordecai
's
strain
hand
 
<EOS>
an
act
just
then
equal
to
many
speech
.
<EOS>
and
after
that
he
say
,
without
haste
,
as
if
conscious
that
he
may
be
wrong
    
<EOS>
"
do
you
forget
what
I

I

"
  
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
true

"
Mordecai
whisper
immediately
,
with
no
sign
of
shock
.
<EOS>
the
sympathetic
hand
still
upon
him
have
fortify
the
feeling
which
be
strong
than
those
word
of
denial
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
perceptible
pause
,
Deronda
feel
it
impossible
to
answer
,
conscious
indeed
that
the
assertion
"
It
can
not
be
true
"
 
<EOS>
have
the
pressure
of
argument
for
him
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
,
too
entirely
possess
by
the
supreme
importance
of
the
relation
between
himself
and
Deronda
to
have
any
other
care
in
his
speech
,
follow
up
that
assertion
by
a
second
,
which
come
to
his
lip
as
a
mere
sequence
of
his
long
-
cherish
conviction
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
not

<EOS>
"
how
do
you

"
say
Daniel
,
with
an
habitual
shrinking
which
make
him
remove
his
hand
from
Mordecai
's
,
who
also
relax
his
hold
,
and
fall
back
into
his
former
lean
position
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
 
<EOS>
I
know
it

what

Mordecai

with
a
low
cry
of
impatience
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
tell
me
everything
:
tell
me
why
you
deny

"
  
<EOS>
He
could
have
no
conception
what
that
demand
be
to
the
hearer
 
<EOS>
how
probingly
it
touch
the
hidden
sensibility
,
the
vividly
conscious
reticence
of
year
;
how
the
uncertainty
he
be
insist
on
as
part
of
his
own
hope
have
always
for
Daniel
be
a
threatening
possibility
of
painful
revelation
about
his
mother

<EOS>
but
the
moment
have
influence
which
be
not
only
new
but
solemn
to
Deronda
;
any
evasion
here
may
turn
out
to
be
a
hateful
refusal
of
some
task
that
belong
to
him
,
some
act
of
due
fellowship
;
in
any
case
it
would
be
a
cruel
rebuff
to
a
being
who
be
appeal
to
him
as
a
forlorn
hope
under
the
shadow
of
a
come
doom
.
<EOS>
after
a
few
moment
,
he
say
,
with
a
great
effort
over
himself
 
determine
to
tell
all
the
truth
briefly
    
<EOS>
"
I

never

I

no
knowledge

I

I

<EOS>
Deronda
's
deep
tone
have
a
tremor
in
them
as
he
utter
this
confession
;
and
all
the
while
there
be
an
undercurrent
of
amazement
in
him
at
the
strange
circumstance
under
which
he
utter
it
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
Mordecai
be
hardly
overrate
his
own
power
to
determine
the
action
of
the
friend
whom
he
have
mysteriously
choose
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be

it

Mordecai
,
triumphantly

into

expression

into

firmly
resistant
.

shall
be
certain
 
certain
that
I
have
be
delude
.
<EOS>
that
hour
will
never
come
!
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
feel
a
new
chord
sound
in
his
speech
:
it
be
rather
imperious
than
appeal
 
<EOS>
have
more
of
conscious
power
than
of
the
yearning
need
which
have
act
as
a
beseech
grasp
on
him
before
.
<EOS>
and
usually
,
though
he
be
the
reverse
of
pugnacious
,
such
a
change
of
attitude
toward
him
would
have
weaken
his
inclination
to
admit
a
claim
.
<EOS>
but
here
there
be
something
that
balance
his
resistance
and
keep
it
aloof
.
<EOS>
this
strong
man
whose
gaze
be
sustainedly
calm
and
his
finger
-
nail
pink
with
health
,
who
be
exercise
in
all
questioning
,
and
accuse
of
excessive
mental
independence
,
still
feel
a
subduing
influence
over
him
in
the
tenacious
certitude
of
the
fragile
creature
before
him
,
whose
pallid
yellow
nostril
be
tense
with
effort
as
his
breath
labor
under
the
burthen
of
eager
speech
.
<EOS>
the
influence
seem
to
strengthen
the
bond
of
sympathetic
obligation
.
<EOS>
in
Deronda
at
this
moment
the
desire
to
escape
what
may
turn
into
a
try
embarrassment
be
no
more
likely
to
determine
action
than
the
solicitation
of
indolence
be
likely
to
determine
it
in
one
with
whom
industry
be
a
daily
law
.
<EOS>
He
answer
simply
    
"
It
be
my
wish
to
meet
and
satisfy
your
wish
wherever
that
be
possible
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
certain
to
me
at
least
that
I
desire
not
to
undervalue
your
toil
and
your
suffering
.
<EOS>
let
me
know
your
thought
.
<EOS>
but
where
can
we
meet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
think
of
that
,
"
say
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
hard
for
you
to
come
into
this
neighborhood
later
in
the
evening
?
<EOS>
You
do
so
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
manage
it
very
well
occasionally
,
"
say
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
You
live
under
the
same
roof
with
the
Cohens
,
I
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
before
Mordecai
could
answer
,
Mr.
Ram
re
-
enter
to
take
his
place
behind
the
counter
.
<EOS>
He
be
an
elderly
son
of
Abraham
,
whose
childhood
have
fall
on
the
evil
time
at
the
beginning
of
this
century
,
and
who
remain
amid
this
smart
and
instructed
generation
as
a
preserve
speciman
,
soak
through
and
through
with
the
effect
of
the
poverty
and
contempt
which
be
the
common
heritage
of
most
English
Jews
seventy
year
ago
.
<EOS>
He
have
none
of
the
oily
cheerfulness
observable
in
Mr.
Cohen
's
aspect
:
<EOS>
his
very
feature
 
broad
and
chubby
 
show
that
tendency
to
look
mongrel
without
due
cause
,
which
,
in
a
miscellaneous
London
neighborhood
,
may
perhaps
be
compare
with
the
marvel
of
imitation
in
insect
,
and
may
have
be
nature
's
imperfect
effort
on
behalf
of
the
pure
Caucasian
to
shield
him
from
the
shame
and
spit
to
which
purer
feature
would
have
be
expose
in
the
time
of
zeal
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Ram
deal
ably
in
book
,
in
the
same
way
that
he
would
have
deal
in
tin
of
meat
and
other
commodity
 
without
knowledge
or
responsibility
as
to
the
proportion
of
rottenness
or
nourishment
they
may
contain
.
<EOS>
but
he
believe
in
Mordecai
's
learning
as
something
marvellous
,
and
be
not
sorry
that
his
conversation
should
be
seek
by
a
bookish
gentleman
,
whose
visit
have
twice
end
in
a
purchase
.
<EOS>
He
greet
Deronda
with
a
crabbed
good
-
will
,
and
,
put
on
large
silver
spectacle
,
appear
at
once
to
abstract
himself
in
the
daily
account
.
  
<EOS>
but
Deronda
and
Mordecai
be
soon
in
the
street
together
,
and
without
any
explicit
agreement
as
to
their
direction
,
be
walk
toward
Ezra
Cohen
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
can
not
meet
there
:
my
room
be
too
narrow
,
"
say
Mordecai
,
take
up
the
thread
of
talk
where
they
have
drop
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
tavern
not
far
from
here
where
I
sometimes
go
to
a
club
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
_
Hand
and
Banner
_
,
in
the
street
at
the
next
turning
,
five
door
down
.
<EOS>
We
can
have
the
parlor
there
any
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
can
try
that
for
once
,
"
say
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
but
you
will
perhaps
let
me
provide
you
with
some
lodging
,
which
would
give
you
more
freedom
and
comfort
than
where
you
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
need
nothing
.
<EOS>
My
outer
life
be
as
nought
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
nothing
less
precious
from
you
than
your
soul
's
brotherhood
.
<EOS>
I
will
think
of
nothing
else
yet
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
glad
you
be
rich
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
need
money
on
that
diamond
ring
.
<EOS>
You
have
some
other
motive
for
bring
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
be
a
little
startled
by
this
clear
-
sightedness
;
but
before
he
could
reply
Mordecai
add
 
<EOS>
"
it
be
all
one
.
<EOS>
have
you
be
in
need
of
the
money
,
the
great
end
would
have
be
that
we
should
meet
again
.
<EOS>
but
you
be
rich
?
"
<EOS>
he
end
,
in
a
tone
of
interrogation
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
rich
,
except
in
the
sense
that
every
one
be
rich
who
have
more
than
he
need
for
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
desire
that
your
life
should
be
free
,
"
say
Mordecai
,
dreamily
 
"
mine
have
be
a
bondage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
clear
that
he
have
no
interest
in
the
fact
of
Deronda
's
appearance
at
the
Cohens
'
beyond
its
relation
to
his
own
ideal
purpose
.
<EOS>
despair
of
lead
easily
up
to
the
question
he
wish
to
ask
,
Deronda
determine
to
put
it
abruptly
,
and
say
    
"
Can
you
tell
me
why
Mrs.
Cohen
,
the
mother
,
must
not
be
speak
to
about
her
daughter
?
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
immediate
answer
,
and
he
think
that
he
should
have
to
repeat
the
question
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
that
Mordecai
have
hear
the
word
,
but
have
to
drag
his
mind
to
a
new
subject
away
from
his
passionate
preoccupation
.
<EOS>
after
a
few
moment
,
he
reply
with
a
careful
effort
such
as
he
would
have
use
if
he
have
be
ask
the
road
to
Holborn
      
<EOS>
"
I
know
the
reason
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
speak
even
of
trivial
family
affair
which
I
have
hear
in
the
privacy
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
I
dwell
in
their
tent
as
in
a
sanctuary
.
<EOS>
Their
history
,
so
far
as
they
injure
none
other
,
be
their
own
possession
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
feel
the
blood
mount
to
his
cheek
as
a
sort
of
rebuke
<EOS>
he
be
little
use
to
,
and
he
also
find
himself
painfully
baffle
where
he
have
reckon
with
some
confidence
on
get
decisive
knowledge
.
<EOS>
He
become
the
more
conscious
of
emotional
strain
from
the
excitement
of
the
day
;
and
although
he
have
the
money
in
his
pocket
to
redeem
his
ring
,
he
recoil
from
the
further
task
of
a
visit
to
the
Cohens
'
,
which
must
be
make
not
only
under
the
former
uncertainty
,
but
under
a
new
disappointment
as
to
the
possibility
of
its
removal
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
part
from
you
now
,
"
he
say
,
just
before
they
could
reach
Cohen
's
door
;
and
Mordecai
pause
,
look
up
at
him
with
an
anxious
fatigued
face
under
the
gaslight
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
will
you
come
back
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
with
slow
emphasis
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
leave
that
unfixed
?
<EOS>
May
I
ask
for
you
at
the
Cohens
'
any
evening
after
your
hour
at
the
book
-
shop
?
<EOS>
there
be
no
objection
,
I
suppose
,
to
their
knowing
that
you
and
I
meet
in
private
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
none
,
"
say
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
"
but
the
day
I
wait
now
be
long
than
the
year
of
my
strength

what

My

in
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
faithful

"
say
Deronda
 
<EOS>
he
could
not
have
leave
those
word
unuttere
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
come
the
first
evening
<EOS>
I
can
after
seven
:
on
Saturday
or
Monday
,
if
possible
.
<EOS>
trust
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
put
out
his
ungloved
hand
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
,
clasp
it
eagerly
,
seem
to
feel
a
new
instreaming
of
confidence
,
and
he
say
with
some
recover
energy
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
come
to
pass

come

<EOS>
imagine
the
conflict
in
a
mind
like
<EOS>
Deronda
's
give
not
only
to
feel
strongly
but
to
question
actively
,
on
the
evening
after
the
interview
with
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
to
a
young
man
of
much
dull
susceptibility
the
adventure
may
have
seem
enough
out
of
the
common
way
to
divide
his
thought
;
but
it
have
stir
Deronda
so
deeply
,
that
with
the
usual
reaction
of
his
intellect
he
begin
to
examine
the
ground
of
his
emotion
,
and
consider
how
far
he
must
resist
its
guidance
.
<EOS>
the
consciousness
that
he
be
half
dominate
by
Mordecai
's
energetic
certitude
,
and
still
more
by
his
fervent
trust
,
rouse
his
alarm
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
characteristic
bias
to
shrink
from
the
moral
stupidity
of
value
<EOS>
lightly
what
have
come
close
to
him
,
and
of
miss
blindly
in
his
own
life
of
to
-
day
the
crisis
which
he
recognize
as
momentous
and
sacred
in
the
historic
life
of
man
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
read
of
this
incident
as
have
happen
century
ago
in
Rome
,
Greece
,
Asia
Minor
,
Palestine
,
Cairo
,
to
some
man
young
as
himself
,
dissatisfy
with
his
neutral
life
,
and
want
some
close
fellowship
,
some
more
special
duty
to
give
him
ardor
for
the
possible
consequence
of
his
work
,
it
would
have
appear
to
him
quite
natural
that
the
incident
should
have
create
a
deep
impression
on
that
far
-
off
man
,
whose
clothing
and
action
would
have
be
see
in
his
imagination
as
part
of
an
age
chiefly
known
to
us
through
its
more
serious
effect
.
<EOS>
why
should
he
be
ashamed
of
his
own
agitated
feeling
merely
because
he
dress
for
dinner
,
wear
a
white
tie
,
and
live
among
people
who
may
laugh
at
his
own
any
conscience
in
the
matter
,
as
the
solemn
folly
of
take
himself
too
seriously
?
 
<EOS>
that
bugbear
of
circle
in
which
the
lack
of
grave
emotion
pass
for
wit
.
<EOS>
from
such
cowardice
before
modish
ignorance
and
obtuseness
,
Deronda
shrink
.
<EOS>
but
he
also
shrink
from
have
his
course
determine
by
mere
contagion
,
without
consent
of
reason
;
or
from
allow
a
reverential
pity
for
spiritual
struggle
to
hurry
him
along
a
dimly
-
see
path
.
  
<EOS>
what
,
after
all
,
have
really
happen
?
<EOS>
He
know
quite
accurately
the
answer
Sir
Hugo
would
have
give
:
"
a
consumptive
Jew
,
possess
by
a
fanaticism
which
obstacle
and
hasten
death
intensify
,
have
fix
on
Deronda
as
the
antitype
of
some
visionary
image
,
the
offspring
of
wed
hope
and
despair
:
despair
of
his
own
life
,
irrepressible
hope
in
the
propagation
of
his
fanatical
belief
.
<EOS>
the
instance
be
perhaps
odd
,
exceptional
in
its
form
,
but
substantially
it
be
not
rare
.
<EOS>
fanaticism
be
not
so
common
as
bankruptcy
,
but
take
in
all
its
aspect
it
be
abundant
enough
.
<EOS>
while
Mordecai
be
wait
on
the
bridge
for
the
fulfillment
of
his
vision
,
another
man
be
convince
that
he
have
the
mathematical
key
of
the
universe
which
would
supersede
Newton
,
and
regard
all
know
physicist
as
conspire
to
stifle
his
discovery
and
keep
the
universe
lock
;
another
,
that
he
have
the
metaphysical
key
,
with
just
that
hair's
-
breadth
of
difference
from
the
old
ward
which
would
make
it
fit
exactly
.
<EOS>
scatter
here
and
there
in
every
direction
you
may
find
a
terrible
person
,
with
more
or
less
power
of
speech
,
and
with
an
eye
either
glitter
or
preternaturally
dull
,
on
the
look
-
out
for
the
man
who
must
hear
him
;
and
in
most
case
he
have
volume
which
it
be
difficult
to
get
print
,
or
if
print
to
get
read
.
<EOS>
this
Mordecai
happen
to
have
a
more
pathetic
aspect
,
a
more
passionate
,
penetrative
speech
than
be
usual
with
such
monomaniacs
;
he
be
more
poetical
than
a
social
reformer
with
colored
view
of
the
new
moral
world
in
parallelograms
,
or
than
an
enthusiast
in
sewage
;
still
he
come
under
the
same
class
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
only
right
and
kind
to
indulge
him
a
little
,
to
comfort
him
with
such
help
as
be
practicable
;
but
what
likelihood
be
there
that
his
notion
have
the
sort
of
value
he
ascribe
to
them
?
<EOS>
in
such
case
a
man
of
the
world
know
what
to
think
beforehand
.
<EOS>
and
as
to
Mordecai
's
conviction
that
he
have
find
a
new
executive
self
,
it
may
be
prepare
for
him
the
bad
of
disappointment
 
that
which
present
itself
as
final
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
's
ear
catch
all
these
negative
whispering
;
nay
,
he
repeat
them
distinctly
to
himself
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
first
<EOS>
but
it
be
the
most
pressing
occasion
on
which
he
have
have
to
face
this
question
of
the
family
likeness
among
the
heir
of
enthusiasm
,
whether
prophet
or
dreamer
of
dream
,
whether
the
    
"
great
benefactor
of
mankind
,
deliverer
,
"
  
or
the
devotee
of
phantasmal
discovery
 
from
the
first
believer
in
his
own
unmanifested
inspiration
,
down
to
the
last
inventor
of
an
ideal
machine
that
will
achieve
perpetual
motion
.
<EOS>
the
kinship
of
human
passion
,
the
sameness
of
mortal
scenery
,
inevitably
fill
fact
with
burlesque
and
parody
.
<EOS>
error
and
folly
have
have
their
hecatomb
of
martyr
.
<EOS>
reduce
the
grand
type
of
man
hitherto
know
to
an
abstract
statement
of
his
quality
and
effort
,
and
he
appear
in
dangerous
company
:
say
that
,
like
Copernicus
and
Galileo
,

<EOS>
this
track
of
thinking
be
familiar
enough
to
Deronda
to
have
save
him
from
any
contemptuous
prejudgment
of
Mordecai
,
even
if
their
communication
have
be
free
from
that
peculiar
claim
on
himself
strangely
usher
in
by
some
long
-
grow
preparation
in
the
Jew
's
agitated
mind

<EOS>
this
claim
,
indeed
,
consider
in
what
be
call
a
rational
way
,
may
seem
justifiably
dismiss
as
illusory
and
even
preposterous
;
but
it
be
precisely
what
turn
Mordecai
's
hold
on
him
from
an
appeal
to
his
ready
sympathy
into
a
clutch
on
his
struggle
conscience
.
<EOS>
Our
conscience
be
not
all
of
the
same
pattern
,
an
inner
deliverance
of
fixed
law
:
they
be
the
voice
of
sensibility
as
various
as
our
memory
(
which
also
have
their
kinship
and
likeness
)
.
<EOS>
and
Deronda
's
conscience
include
sensibility
beyond
the
common
,
enlarge
by
his
early
habit
of
think
himself
imaginatively
into
the
experience
of
other
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
the
claim
this
eager
soul
make
upon
him
?
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
believe
my
belief
 
be
move
by
my
reason
 
<EOS>
hope
my
hope
 
see
the
vision
I
point
to
 
behold
a

where
I
behold
it
!
"
<EOS>
to
take
such
a
demand
in
the
light
of
an
obligation
in
any
direct
sense
would
have
be
preposterous
 
to
have
seem
to
admit
it
would
have
be
dishonesty
;
and
Deronda
,
look
on
the
agitation
of
those
moment
,
feel
thankful
that
in
the
midst
of
his
compassion
he
have
preserve
himself
from
the
bondage
of
false
concession
.
<EOS>
the
claim
hang
,
too
,
on
a
supposition
which
may
be
 
nay
,
probably
be
 
in
discordance
with
the
full
fact
:
the
supposition
that
he
,
Deronda
,
be
of
jewish
blood
.
<EOS>
be
there
ever
a
more
hypothetic
appeal
?
  
<EOS>
but
since
the
age
of
thirteen
Deronda
have
associate
the
deep
experience
of
his
affection
with
what
be
a
pure
supposition
,
namely
,
that
Sir
Hugo
be
his
father
<EOS>
:
that
be
a
hypothesis
which
have
be
the
source
of
passionate
struggle
within
him
;
by
its
light
he
have
be
accustom
to
subdue
feeling
and
to
cherish
them
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
well
use
to
find
a
motive
in
a
conception
which
may
be
disprove
;
and
he
have
be
also
use
to
think
of
some
revelation
that
may
influence
his
view
of
the
particular
duty
belong
to
him
.
<EOS>
to
be
in
a
state
of
suspense
,
which
be
also
one
of
emotive
activity
and
scruple
,
be
a
familiar
attitude
of
his
conscience
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
suppose
that
wish
-
begotten
belief
in
his
jewish
birth
,
and
that
extravagant
demand
of
discipleship
,
to
be
the
foreshadowing
of
an
actual
discovery
and
a
genuine
spiritual
result
:
suppose
that
Mordecai
's
idea
make
a
real
conquest
over
Deronda
's
conviction
?
<EOS>
nay
,
it
be
conceivable
that
as
Mordecai
need
and
believe
that
,
he
have
find
an
active
replenishment
of
himself
,
so
Deronda
may
receive
from
Mordecai
's
mind
the
complete
ideal
shape
of
that
personal
duty
and
citizenship
which
lie
in
his
own
thought
like
sculptured
fragment
certify
some
beauty
yearn
after
but
not
traceable
by
divination
.
  
<EOS>
as
that
possibility
present
itself
in
his
meditation
,
he
be
aware
that
it
would
be
call
dreamy
,
and
begin
to
defend
it
.
<EOS>
if
the
influence
he
imagine
himself
submit
to
have
be
that
of
some
honored
professor
,
some
authority
in
a
seat
of
learning
,
some
philosopher
who
have
be
accept
as
a
voice
of
the
age
,
would
a
thorough
receptiveness
toward
direction
have
be
ridicule
?
<EOS>
only
by
those
who
hold
it
a
sign
of
weakness
to
be
oblige
for
an
idea
,
and
prefer
to
hint
that
they
have
implicitly
hold
in
a
more
correct
form
whatever
other
have
state
with
a
sadly
short
-
come
explicitness
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
what
be
there
but
vulgarity
in
take
the
fact
that
Mordecai
be
a
poor
jewish
workman
,
and
that
he
be
to
be
meet
perhaps
on
a
sanded
floor
in
the
parlor
of
the
_
Hand
and
Banner
_
as
a
reason
for
determine
beforehand
that
there
be
not
some
spiritual
force
within
him
that
may
have
a
determine
effect
on
a
white
-
handed
gentleman
?
<EOS>
there
be
a
legend
tell
of
the
Emperor
Domitian
,
that
have
hear
of
a
jewish
family
,
of
the
house
of
David
,
whence
the
ruler
of
the
world
be
to
spring
,
he
send
for
its
member
in
alarm
,
but
quickly
release
them
on
observe
that
they
have
the
hand
of
work
-
people
 
be
of
just
the
opposite
opinion
with
that
Rabbi
who
stand
wait
at
the
gate
of
Rome
in
confidence
that
the
Messiah
would
be
find
among
the
destitute
who
enter
there
.
<EOS>
both
Emperor
and
Rabbi
be
wrong
in
their
trust
of
outward
sign
:
<EOS>
poverty
and
poor
clothe
be
no
sign
of
inspiration
,
say
Deronda
to
his
inward
objector
,
but
they
have
go
with
it
in
some
remarkable
case
.
<EOS>
and
to
regard
discipleship
as
out
of
the
question
because
of
them
,
would
be
mere
dullness
of
imagination
.
  
<EOS>
a
more
plausible
reason
for
put
discipleship
out
of
the
question
be
the
strain
of
visionary
excitement
in
Mordecai
,
which
turn
his
wish
into
overmaster
impression
,
and
make
him
read
outward
fact
as
fulfillment
.
<EOS>
be
such
a
temper
of
mind
likely
to
accompany
that
wise
estimate
of
consequence
which
be
the
only
safeguard
from
fatal
error
,
even
to
ennoble
motive
?
<EOS>
but
it
remain
to
be
see
whether
that
rare
conjunction
exist
or
not
in
Mordecai
:
perhaps
his
may
be
one
of
the
nature
where
a
wise
estimate
of
consequence
be
fuse
in
the
fire
of
that
passionate
belief
which
determine
the
consequence
it
believe
in
.
<EOS>
the
inspiration
of
the
world
have
come
in
that
way
too
:
even
strictly
-
measure
science
could
hardly
have
get
on
without
that
forecasting
ardor
which
feel
the
agitation
of
discovery
beforehand
,
and
have
a
faith
in
its
preconception
that
surmount
many
failure
of
experiment
.
<EOS>
and
in
relation
to
human
motive
and
action
,
passionate
belief
have
a
full
efficacy
.
<EOS>
here
enthusiasm
may
have
the
validity
of
proof
,
and
happen
in
one
soul
,
give
the
type
of
what
will
one
day
be
general
.
  
<EOS>
at
least
,
Deronda
argue
,
Mordecai
's
visionary
excitability
be
hardly
a
reason
for
conclude
beforehand
that
he
be
not
worth
listen
to

for
pity
sake

<EOS>

he
have
introduce
himself
as

this

be
there
not
something

He

we

industrious
so
far
as
a
poor
creature
can
be
,

take
as
much
delight
in
the

as
anybody
could

<EOS>
but
this
last
day

two
he
be
be
move
about
like
a

walker

else
sit
as
still

doubt
whether

no

He

us

ourselves

my

It

Skillful
Jacob
seem
to

turn
the
handle

as
noiselessly
as
possible
,
while

go
behind
him

stand
on
the
threshold

the
small
room
be
light
only
by
a
die
fire
and
one
candle
with

shade
over
it

on

board
fix
under

various

Mordecai

at

door

on

on

board

a
watch
prop
on
a
stand
before
him

<EOS>
He
be
in
a
state
of
expectation
as
sickening
as
that
of
a
prisoner
listen
for
the
delay
deliverance
 
when
he

voice
say
,
"
I

seize
his
furred
cap

lie
near

move
to
join
Deronda

<EOS>
It
be

a
moment
before
they
be
both
in

room

and
Jacob
,
notice
the
change
in
his
friend

air

expression

seize
him
by
the
arm

"
see
my
cup
and
ball
!
<EOS>
"
send
the
ball
up
close
to
Mordecai
's
face
,
as
something
likely
to
cheer
a
convalescent

<EOS>
It
be
a
sign
of
the
relieved
tension
in
Mordecai

mind
that
he
could
smile
and
say
,

fine

fine
!

"
You

in
an
undertone

"
I
tell
you
so

I

right

then
in
his
usual
voice
,
"
well

sir

we
must
not

<EOS>
here
Cohen
wink
down
at
Jacob
's
back

but
it
be
doubtful
whether
this
judicious
allusiveness
answer
its
purpose

for
its
subject
give
a
nasal
whinnying
laugh

about

<EOS>
Deronda
think
,
"
I
shall
never
know
anything
decisive
about
these
people
until
I
ask
Cohen
pointblank
whether
he
lose
a
sister
name
Mirah
when
she
be
six
year
old

<EOS>
"
the
decisive
moment
do
not
yet
seem
easy
for
him
to
face

<EOS>
still
his
first
sense
of
repulsion
at
the
commonness
of
these
people
be
begin
to
be
temper
with
kindly
feeling
.
<EOS>
however
unrefined
their
air
and
speech
may
be
,
he
be
force
to
admit
some
moral
refinement
in
their
treatment
of
the
consumptive
workman
,
whose
mental
distinction
impress
them
chiefly
as
a
harmless
,
silent
raving
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
Cohens
seem
to
have
an
affection
for
you

"
say
Deronda
,
as
soon
as
he
and
Mordecai
be
off
the
doorstep
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
for
them
,
"
be
the
immediate
answer

They
have
the

I

you

by

<EOS>
certainly
a

draw
together

reason
for
not

himself

<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
his
weakness
to

that
in

it
be
no
more
wonder
that
quantity
should

that

should
remain
the

in

<EOS>
Lily
say
this
,
we
go
off
on
the
cause
of
social
change
,
and
when
you
come
in
I
be
go
upon
the
power
of
idea
,
which
I
hold
to
be
the
main
transforming
cause

<EOS>
"
  
"
I
do
not
hold
with
you
there

Miller

Goodwin
,
the

more
concerned

on

to

word
from
the

<EOS>
"
for
either
you
mean
so
many
sort

I
get
no
knowledge
by
what
you
say

any
more
than
if
you
say
light
be
a
cause
;
or
else
you
mean
a
particular
sort
of
idea

and
then
I
go
against
your
meaning
as
too
narrow
.
<EOS>
for
,
look
at
it
in
one
way
,
all
action
man
put
a
bit
of
thought
into
<EOS>
be
idea
 
<EOS>
say
,
sow
seed
,
or
make
a
canoe
,
or
baking
clay
;
and
such
idea
as
these
work
themselves
into
life
and
go
on
grow
with
it
,
but
they
can
not
go
apart
from
the
material
that
set
them
to
work
and
make
a
medium
for
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
nature
of
wood
and
stone
yield
to
the
knife
that
raise
the
idea
of
shape
them
,
and
with
plenty
of
wood
and
stone
the
shaping
will
go
on
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
it
,
that
such
idea
as
be
mix
straight
away
with
all
the
other
element
of
life
be
powerful
along
with
'em
.
<EOS>
the
slow
the
mixing
,
the
less
power
they
have
.
<EOS>
and
as
to
the
cause
of
social
change
,
I
look
at
it
in
this
way
 
<EOS>
idea
be
a
sort
of
parliament
,

there
be
a
commonwealth
outside

work
at

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
if
you
take
ready
mixing
as
your
test
of
power
,
"
say
Pash
,
"
some
of
the
least
practical
idea
beat
everything

<EOS>
They
spread

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Pash
,
his
dark
face
light
up
rather
impishly
,
"
there
be
the
idea
of
nationality
<EOS>
;
I
dare
say
the
wild
ass
be
snuff
it
,
and
get
more
gregarious
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
share
that
idea
?
"
say
Deronda
,
find
a
piquant
incongruity
between
Pash
's
sarcasm
and
the
strong
stamp
of
race
on
his
feature
.
  
<EOS>
"
say
,
rather
<EOS>
,
he
do
not
share
that
spirit
,
"
say
Mordecai
,
who
have
turn
a
melancholy
glance
on
Pash
.
<EOS>
"
unless
nationality
be
a
feeling

what
force
can
it
have
as
an
idea
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
grant
,
Mordecai
,
"
say
Pash
,
quite
good
-
humoredly
.
"
<EOS>
and
as
the
feeling
of
nationality
be
die
,
I
take
the
idea
to
be
no
well
than
a
ghost
,
already
walk
to
announce
the
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a

may
seem

<EOS>
We
may
live

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"

"
say
Mordecai
,
look
at
Deronda
with
a
delight
which
be
the
beginning
of
recover
energy
<EOS>
:
his
attitude
be
more
upright
,
his
face
be
less
worn
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
may
hold
with
backward
nation
,
"
say
Pash
,
"
<EOS>
but
with
us
in
Europe
the
sentiment
of
nationality
be
destine
to
die
out
.
<EOS>
It
will
last
a
little
longer
in
the
quarter
where
oppression
last
,
but
nowhere
else
.
<EOS>
the
whole
current
of
progress
be
set
against
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
"
say
Buchan
,
in
a
rapid
thin
Scotch
tone
which
be
like
the
letting
in
of
a
little
cool
air
on
the
conversation
,
"
ye've
do
well
to
bring
us
round
to
the
point
.
<EOS>
Ye're
all
agree
that
society
change
 
not
always
and
everywhere
 
but
on
the
whole
and
in
the
long
run
.
<EOS>
now
,
with
all
deference
,
I
would
beg
t
'
observe
that
we
have
get
to
examine
the
nature
of
change
before
we
have
a
warrant
to
call
them
progress
,
which
word
be
suppose
to
include
a
bettering
,
though
I
apprehend
it
to
be
ill
-
choose
for
that
purpose
,
since
mere
motion
onward
may
carry
us
to
a
bog
or
a
precipice
.
<EOS>
and
the
question
I
would
put
be
three
:
<EOS>
be
all
change
in
the
direction
of
progress
?
<EOS>
if
not
,
how
shall
we
discern
which
change
be
progress
and
<EOS>
which
not
?
<EOS>
and
thirdly
,
how
far
and
in
what
way
can
we
act
upon
the
course
of
change
so
as
to
promote
it
where
it
be
beneficial
,
and
divert
it
where
it
be
injurious
?
"
  
<EOS>
but
Buchan
's
attempt
to
impose
his
method
on
the
talk
be
a
failure
.
<EOS>
Lily
immediately
say
    
"
change
and
progress
be
merge
in
the
idea
of
development
.
<EOS>
the
law
of
development
be
be
discover
,
and
change
take
place
accord
to
them
be
necessarily
progressive
;
that
be
to
say
,
it
we
have
any
notion
of
progress
or
improvement
oppose
to
them
,
the
notion
be
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
can
not
see
how
you
arrive
at
that
sort
of
certitude
about
change
by
call
them
development
,
"
say
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
there
will
still
remain
the
degree
of
inevitableness
in
relation
to
our
own
will
and
act
,
and
the
degree
of
wisdom
in
hastening
or
retard
;
there
will
still
remain
the
danger
of
mistake
a
tendency
which
should
be
resist
for
an
inevitable
law
that
we
must
adjust
ourselves
to
,
 
which
seem
to
me
as
bad
a
superstition
or
false
god
as
any
that
have
be
set
up
without

ceremony
of
philosophising

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
truth

say
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Woe
to
the
man
who
see
no
place
for
resistance
in
this
generation
!
<EOS>
I
believe
in
a
growth
,
a
passage
,
and
a
new
unfolding
of
life
whereof
the
seed
be
more
perfect
,
more
charge
with
the
element
that
be
pregnant
with
diviner
form
.
<EOS>
the
life
of
a
people
grow
,
it
be
knit
together
and
yet
expand
,
in
joy
and
sorrow
,
in
thought
and
action
;
it
absorb
the
thought
of
other
nation
into
its
own
form
,
and
give
back
the
thought
as
new
wealth
to
the
world
;
it
be
a
power
and
an
organ
in
the
great
body
of
the
nation
.
<EOS>
but
there
may
come
a
check
,
an
arrest
;
memory
may
be
stifle
,
and
love
may
be
faint
for
the
lack
of
them
;
or
memory
may
shrink
into
withered
relic
 
the
soul
of
a
people
,
whereby
they
know
themselves
to
be
one
,
may
seem
to
be
die
for
want
of
common
action
.
<EOS>
but
who
shall
say
,
"
the
fountain
of
their
life
be
dry
up
,
they
shall
forever
cease
to
be
a
nation

<EOS>
"
who
shall
say
it
?
<EOS>
not
he
who
feel
the
life
of
his
people
stir
within
his
own

<EOS>
Shall
he
say
,
"
that
way

I
will
not

<EOS>
His
very
soul
be
resistance

and
be
as
a
seed
of
fire
that
may
enkindle
the
soul
of
multitude

now
we

political
equality

I
be
for
get
rid
of
all
of

exclusiveness

there

Gideon

the

Pash

grimace

You
get
ten

Mordecai

what
do
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
Deronda
,
all
ear
for
these
hint
of
Mordecai
's
opinion
,
be
inwardly
wonder
at
his
persistence
in
come
to
this
club
.
<EOS>
for
an
enthusiastic
spirit
to
meet
continually
the
fix
indifference
of
man
familiar
with
the
object
of
his
enthusiasm
be
the
acceptance
of
a
slow
martyrdom
,
beside
which
the
fate
of
a
missionary
tomahawk
without
any
considerate
rejection
of
his
doctrine
seem
hardly
worthy
of
compassion
.
<EOS>
but
Mordecai
give
no
sign
of
shrink
:
this
be
a
moment
of
spiritual
fullness
,
and
he
care
more
for
the
utterance
of
his
faith
than
for
its
immediate
reception
.
<EOS>
with
a
fervor
which
have
no
temper
in
it
,
but
seem
rather
the
rush
of
feeling
in
the
opportunity
of
speech
,
he
answer
Pash
:
    
<EOS>
"
what
I
say
be
,
let
every
man
keep
far
away
from
the
brotherhood
and
inheritance
<EOS>
he
despise
.
<EOS>
thousand

thousand
of
our

mix
with
the
Gentiles
as
Celt
with
Saxon

they
may
inherit
the
blessing
that
belong
to
the
Gentile

<EOS>
You
can
not
follow
them

<EOS>
You
be
one
of
the
multitude

must
walk
among
the
nation

be
know

Jews

mean

the
breath

contempt

Can
a

citizenship
weave
itself
straightway
into
the

change
the

eighteen

what
be
the
citizenship
of
him
who
walk
among
a
people
he
have
no

fellowship
with
,

have
lose
the
sense
of
brotherhood

his
own

<EOS>
It
be
a
charter
of
selfish
ambition

rivalry

low

He
be
an
alien

what
I

that
there
be

you

in

decisive
crisis

thin

together
on

I
,
too

claim

rational
 
<EOS>
what
be
it
to

the

<EOS>
It
be

yea

consecrate
it
with
kinship

:
the
past
become
my
parent
and
the
future
stretch
toward
me
the
appeal
arm
of
child

<EOS>
be
it
rational
to
drain
away
the
sap
of
special
kindred
that
make
the
family
of
man
rich
in
interchanged
wealth
,
and
various
as
the

let
my

be
alien

that

then

I
will
seek
to

I

<EOS>
let
the

let
all
his
memorial
be
antiquarian
trifle
,
dead
as
the
wall

painting
of

<EOS>
yet
let
his

learn
by
rote
the
speech
of
the
Greek

where
he
abjure
his
fellow

citizen
by
the
bravery
of
those
who
fight
foremost

Marathon

learn
to

noble
in
the
Greek

that
be
the
spirit
of
an
immortal
nation

the
Jew
have
no
memory
that
bind
him
to
action

laugh
that

the

Masters

Mordecai
throw
himself
back

's
silence

<EOS>
not
one
member
of
the
club
share
his
point
of
view

his
emotion

but
his
whole
personality
and
speech
have
on
them
the
effect
of
a
dramatic
representation
which
have
some
pathos
in
it
,
though
no
practical
consequence

usually
he

indulge

go

must
have
be
the
tragic
pressure

outward

hinder
this

whose
force
he
feel
to
be
tell
on
himself
,
from
make
any
world
for
his
thought
in
the
mind
of
other
 
like
a
poet
among
people
of
a
strange
speech
,
who
may
have
a
poetry
of
their
own
,
but
have
no
ear

his
cadence
,
no

to
his

latent
virtue

tongue

<EOS>
the

Voltairian

never
mind

<EOS>
let
us
have
a
jewish
night
;
we
have
not
have
one
for
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
let
us
take
the
discussion
on
jewish
ground
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
have
no
prejudice
here
;
we
be
all
philosopher
;
and
we
like
our
friend
Mordecai
,
Pash
,
and
Gideon
,
as
well
as
if
they
be
no
more
kin
to
Abraham
than
the
rest
of
us
.
<EOS>
We
be
all
relate
through
Adam
,
until
further
show
to
the
contrary
,
and
if
you
look
into
history
we
have
all
get
some
discreditable
forefather
.
<EOS>
so
I
mean
no
offence
when
I
say
I
do
not
think
any
great
thing
of
the
part
the
jewish
people
have
play
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
I
think
they
be
iniquitously
deal
by
in
past
time
.
<EOS>
and
I
suppose
we
do
not
want
any
man
to
be
maltreat
,
white
,
black
,
brown
,
or
yellow
 
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
I
have
just
give
my
half
-
crown
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
and
that
remind
me
,
I
have
a
curious
old
german
book
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
read
it
myself
,
but
a
friend
of
mine
be
read
out
of
it
to
me
the
other
day
 
about
the
prejudicie
against
the
Jews
,
and
the
story
use
to
be
tell
against
'em
,
and
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
one
be
?
<EOS>
why
,
that
they
be
punish
with
a
bad
odor
in
their
body
;
and
_
that
_
,
say
the
author
,
date
1715
<EOS>
(
I
have
just
be
price
and
mark
the
book
this
very
morning
)
 
<EOS>
that
be
true
,
for
the
ancient
speak
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
he
say
,
the
other
thing
be
fable
,
such
as
that
the
odor
go
away
all
at
once
when
they
be
baptize
,
and
that
every
one
of
the
ten
tribe
,
mind
you
,
all
the
ten
be
concern
in
the
crucifixion
,
have
get
a
particular
punishment
over
and
above
the
smell
:
 
<EOS>
Asher
<EOS>
,
I
remember
,
have
the
right
arm
a
handbreadth
short
than
the
left
,
and
Naphthali
have
pig
's
ear
and
a
smell
of
live
pork
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
of
that
?
<EOS>
there
be
be
a
good
deal
of
fun
make
of
rabbinical
fable
,
but
in
point
of
fable
my
opinion
be
,
that
all
over
the
world
it
be
six
of
one
and
half
-
a
-
dozen
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
I
say
before
,
I
hold
with
the
philosopher
of
the
last
century
that
the
Jews
have
play
no
great
part
as
a
people
,
though
Pash
will
have
it
<EOS>
they
be
clever
enough
to
beat
all
the
rest
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
but
if
so
,
I
ask
,
why
have
not
they
do
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
for
the
same
reason
that
the
clever
man
in
the
country
do
not
get
themselves
or
their
idea
into
Parliament
,
"
say
the
ready
Pash
;
"
because
the
blockhead
be
too
many
for
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
vain
question
,
"
say
Mordecai
,
"
whether
our
people
would
beat
the
rest
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
each
nation
have
its
own
work
,
and
be
a
member
of
the
world
,
enrich
by
the
work
of
each
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
true
,
as
Jehuda
-
ha
-
Levi
first
say
,
that
Israel
be
the
heart
of
mankind
,
if
we
mean
by
heart
the
core
of
affection
which
bind
a
race
and
its
family
in
dutiful
love
,
and
the
reverence
for
the
human
body
which
lift
the
need
of
our
animal
life
into
religion
,
and
the
tenderness
which
be
merciful
to
the
poor
and
weak
and
to
the
dumb
creature
that
wear
the
yoke
for
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
not
behind
any
nation
in
arrogance
,
"
say
Lily
;
"
and
if
they
have
get
in
the
rear

it

not
be

they

over

modest

oh

every

in

Miller

and
some
of
them
in
the
hebrew
text

<EOS>
"
well
,
whatever
the
Jews
contribute
at
one
time

they
be
a
stand

still
people

Lily

<EOS>
"
They
be
the
type
of
obstinate
adherence
to
the
superannuated

<EOS>
They
may
show
good
ability
when
they
take
up
liberal
idea
,
but
as
a
race
they
have
no
development
in
them

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
false
!
"
<EOS>
say
Mordecai
,
lean
forward
again
with
his
former
eagerness

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
let
their
history
be
know
and
examine
;
let
the
seed
be
sift
,
let
its
beginning
be
trace
to
the
weed
of
the
wilderness
 
the
more
glorious
will
be
the
energy
that
transform
it
.
<EOS>
where
else
be
there
a
nation
of
whom
it
may
be
as
truly
say
that
their
religion
and
law
and
moral
life
mingle
as
the
stream
of
blood
in
the
heart
and
make
one
growth
 
where
else
a
people
who
keep
and
enlarge
their
spiritual
store
at
the
very
time
when
they
be
hate
with
a
hatred
as
fierce
as
the
forest
fire
that
chase
the
wild
beast
from
his
covert
?
<EOS>
there
be
a
fable
of
the
Roman
,
that
swimming
to
save
his
life
<EOS>
he
hold
the
roll
of
his
writing
between
his
tooth
and
save
them
from
the
water
.
<EOS>
but
how
much
more
than
that
be
true
of
our
race
?
<EOS>
They
struggle
to
keep
their
place
among
the
nation
like
hero
 
<EOS>
yea
,
when
the
hand
be
hack
off

they
cling
with
their
tooth
;

when
the
plow
and
the
harrow
have
pass
over
the
last
visible
sign
of
their
national
covenant

and
the
fruitfulness
of
their
land
be
stifle
with
the
blood
of

"

us
make

movable

work
it
,

often
breathe
with
scant
life

as

hoot

sink

<EOS>
it
be
not

less
impressive

<EOS>
His
extraordinary
excitement
be
certainly
due

Deronda

it

to
Deronda

rally
all

the

embody
the

not

before
him

what
hitherto

in

carry

within

live
an

careless

possible
make
some
obstruction

he

never

as

inward
vision
 
a

afar
off

would
never

into

throw
his

often

the

It
be
something
more

a
grandiose
transfiguration
of
the
parental
love

renounce

the
suicidal
prompting

this

well
enough
on
one
side
to
make
so
much
of
our
memory
and
inheritance
as
you
do
,
Mordecai
,
"
say
Gideon
;
"
but
there
be
another
side
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
all
gratitude
and
harmless
glory
.
<EOS>
Our
people
have
inherit
a
good
deal
of
hatred
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
pretty
lot
of
curse
still
fly
about
,
and
stiff
settle
rancor
inherit
from
the
time
of
persecution
.
<EOS>
how
will
you
justify
keep
one
sort
of
memory
and
throw
away
the
other
?
<EOS>
there
be
ugly
debt
stand
on
both
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
justify
the
choice
as
all
other
choice
be
justify
,
"
say
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
"
I
cherish
nothing
for
the
jewish
nation
,
I
seek
nothing
for
them
,
but
the
good
which
promise
good
to
all
the
nation
.
<EOS>
the
spirit
of
our
religious
life
,
which
be
one
with
our
national
life
,
be
not
hatred
of
aught
but
wrong
.
<EOS>
the
Master
have
say
,
an
offence
against
man
be
bad
than
an
offence
against
God
.
<EOS>
but
what
wonder
if
there
be
hatred
in
the
breast
of
Jews
,
who
be
child
of
the
ignorant
and
oppress
 
<EOS>
what
wonder
,
since
there
be
hatred
in
the
breast
of
Christians
?
<EOS>
Our
national
life
be
a
grow
light
.
<EOS>
let
the
central
fire
be
kindle
again
,
and
the
light
will
reach
afar
.
<EOS>
the
degraded
and
scorn
of
our
race
will
learn
to
think
of
their
sacred
land
,
not
as
a
place
for
saintly
beggary
to
await
death
in
loathsome
idleness
,
but
as
a
republic
where
the
jewish
spirit
manifest
itself
in
a
new
order
found
on
the
old
,
purify
and
enrich
by
the
experience
our
great
son
have
gather
from
the
life
of
the
age
.
<EOS>
how
long
be
it
?
 
<EOS>
only
two
century
since
a
vessel
carry
over
the
ocean
the
beginning
of
the
great
north
american
nation
.
<EOS>
the
people
grow
like
meeting
water
 
<EOS>
they
be
various
in
habit
and
sect
 
<EOS>
there
come
a
time
,
a
century
ago
,
when
they
need
a
polity
,
and
there
be
hero
of
peace
among
them
.
<EOS>
what
have
they
to
form
a
polity
with
but
memory
of
Europe
,
correct
by
the
vision
of
a
well
?
<EOS>
let
our
wise
and
wealthy
show
themselves
hero
.
<EOS>
They
have
the
memory
of
the
East
and
West
,
and
they
have
the
full
vision
of
a
well
.
<EOS>
a
new
Persia
with
a
purify
religion
magnify
itself
in
art
and
wisdom
.
<EOS>
so
will
a
new
Judaea
,
poise
between
East
and
West
 
a
covenant
of
reconciliation
.
<EOS>
Will
any
say
,
the
prophetic
vision
of
your
race
have
be
hopelessly
mix
with
folly
and
bigotry
:
<EOS>
the
angel
of
progress
have
no
message
for
Judaism
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
half
-
bury
city
for
the
pay
worker
to
lay
open
 
<EOS>
the
water
be
rush
by
it
as
a
forsaken
field
?
<EOS>
I
say
that
the
strong
principle
of
growth
lie
in
human
choice
.
<EOS>
the
son
of
Judah
have
to
choose
that
God
may
again
choose
them
.
<EOS>
the
messianic
time
be
the
time
when
Israel
shall
will
the
planting
of
the
national
ensign
.
<EOS>
the
Nile
overflow
and
rush
onward
:
the
Egyptian
could
not
choose
the
overflow
,
but
he
choose
to
work
and
make
channel
for
the
fructify
water
,
and
Egypt
become
the
land
of
corn
.
<EOS>
shall
man
,
whose
soul
be
set
in
the
royalty
of
discernment
and
resolve
,
deny
his
rank
and
say
,
I
be
an
onlooker
,
ask
no
choice
or
purpose
of
me
?
<EOS>
that
be
the
blasphemy
of
this
time
.
<EOS>
the
divine
principle
of
our
race
be
action
,
choice
,
resolve
memory
.
<EOS>
let
us
contradict
the
blasphemy
,
and
help
to
will
our
own
well
future
and
the
well
future
of
the
world
 
not
renounce
our
high
gift
and
say
,
"
let
us
be
as
if
we
be
not
among
the
population
;
"
but
choose
our
full
heritage
,
claim
the
brotherhood
of
our
nation
,
and
carry
into
it
a
new
brotherhood
with
the
nation
of
the
Gentiles
.
<EOS>
the
vision
be
there
;
it
will
be
fulfil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
the
last
sentence
,
which
be
no
more
than
a
loud
whisper
,
Mordecai
let
his
chin
sink
on
his
breast
and
his
eyelid
fall
.
<EOS>
no
one
speak
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
first
time
that
he
have
insist
on
the
same
idea
,
but
he
be
see
to
-
night
in
a
new
phase
.
<EOS>
the
quiet
tenacity
of
his
ordinary
self
differ
as
much
from
his
present
exaltation
of
mood
as
a
man
in
private
talk
,
give
reason
for
a
revolution
of
which
no
sign
be
discernable
,
differ
from
one
who
feel
himself
an
agent
in
a
revolution
begin
.
<EOS>
the
dawn
of
fulfillment
bring
to
his
hope
by
Deronda
's
presence
<EOS>
have
work
Mordecai
's
conception
into
a
state
of
impassioned
conviction
,
and
he
have
find
strength
in
his
excitement
to
pour
forth
the
unlocked
flood
of
emotive
argument
,
with
a
sense
of
haste
as
at
a
crisis
which
must
be
seize
.
<EOS>
but
now
there
have
come
with
the
quiescence
of
fatigue
a
sort
of
thankful
wonder
that
he
have
speak
 
a
contemplation
of
his
life
as
a
journey
which
have
come
at
last
to
this
bourne
.
<EOS>
after
a
great
excitement
,
the
ebb
strength
of
impulse
be
apt
to
leave
us
in
this
aloofness
from
our
active
self
.
<EOS>
and
in
the
moment
after
Mordecai
have
sink
his
head
,
his
mind
be
wander
along
the
path
of
his
youth
,
and
all
the
hope
which
have
end
in
bring
him
hither
.
  
<EOS>
every
one
feel
that
the
talk
be
end
,
and
the
tone
of
phlegmatic
discussion
make
unseasonable
by
Mordecai
's
high
-
pitched
solemnity
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
they
have
come
together
to
hear
the
blowing
of
the
_
shophar
_
,
and
have
nothing
to
do
now
but
to
disperse
.
<EOS>
the
movement
be
unusually
general
,
and
in
less
than
ten
minute
the
room
be
empty
of
all
except
Mordecai
and
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
good

have
be
give
to
Mordecai

but
it
be
evident
he
have
not
hear
them
,
for
he
remain
rapt
and
motionless
.
<EOS>
Deronda
would
not
disturb
this
needful
rest
,
but
wait
for
a
spontaneous
movement
.
      
<EOS>
"
My

<EOS>
after
a
few
minute
the
unwonted
stillness
have
penetrate
Mordecai
's
consciousness
,
and
he
look
up
at
Deronda
,
not
in
the
least
with
bewilderment
and
surprise
,
but
with
a
gaze
full
of
repose
satisfaction

<EOS>
Deronda
rise
and
place
his
chair
nearer
,
where
there
could
be
no
imagine
need
for
raise
the
voice

<EOS>
Mordecai
feel
the
action
as
a
patient
feel
the
gentleness
that
ease
his
pillow
.
<EOS>
He
begin
to
speak
in
a
low
tone
,
as
if
he
be
only
think
articulately
,
not
try
to
reach
an
audience

<EOS>

in
the

that
need
it
,
that
they
may
be
perfect

then
they
will
depart
from

mortal

It

<EOS>
Mordecai
's
pause
seem
an
appeal
which
Deronda
's
feeling
would
not
let
him
leave
unanswered
.
<EOS>
He
try
to
make
it
truthful
;
but
for
Mordecai
's
ear
it
be
inevitably
fill
with
unspoken
meaning
.
<EOS>
He
only
say
    
"
everything
I
can

"
  
<EOS>
"
I

say
Mordecai

in
a
tone
of
quiet
certainty
which
dispense
with
further
assurance

<EOS>
"
I
hear
it

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
He
be
silent
a
moment
or
two
,

then
go
on
meditatively
    
<EOS>
"
You
will
take
up
my

<EOS>
I
feel
myself
back
in
that
day
when
my

be
break

<EOS>
the
bright
morning
sun
be
on
the
quay
 
<EOS>
it
be
at

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
the

the

that
would
land
us
at
Beyrout
be
to
start
in
an
hour

<EOS>
I
be
go
with
a
merchant
as
his
clerk
and
companion
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
shall
behold
the
land
and
people
of
the
East
,
and
I
shall
speak
with
a
full
vision
.
<EOS>
I
breathe
then
as
you
do
,
without
labor
;
I
have
the
light
step
and
the
endurance
of
youth
,
<EOS>
I
could
fast

I
could
sleep
on
the
hard
ground

<EOS>
I
have
wed
poverty
,
and
I
love
my
bride
 
for
poverty
to
me
be
freedom

<EOS>
My
heart
exult
as
if
it
have
be
the
heart
of
Moses
ben
Maimon
,
strong
with
the
strength
of
three
score
year
,
and
know
the
work
that
be
to
fill
them

<EOS>
It
be
the
first
time
I
have
be
south
;
the
soul
within
me
feel
its
former
sun
;
and
stand
on
the
quay
,
where
the
ground
I
stand
on
seem
to
send
forth
light
,
and
the
shadow
have
an
azure
glory
as
of
spirit
become
visible
<EOS>
,
I
feel
myself
in
the
flood
of
a
glorious
life
,
wherein
my
own
small
year
-
count
existence
seem
to
melt
,
so
that
I
know
it
not

and
a
great
sob
arise
within
me
as
at
the
rush
of
water
that
be
too
strong
a
bliss
.
<EOS>
so
I
stand
there
await
my
companion
;
and
I
see
him
not
till
he
say
:
"
Ezra
,
I
have
be
to
the
post
and
there
be
your

<EOS>
"
Ezra

repeat
Mordecai

affirmatively
,
engross
in

<EOS>
"
I
be
expect
a
letter
;
for
I
write
continually
to
my
mother

<EOS>
and
that
sound
of
my
name
be
like
the
touch

a
wand
that
recall
me
to

I
have
be
release
as
it

mingle
with
the
ocean
of
human
existence

free
from
the
pressure
of
individual
bondage

<EOS>
I
open
the
letter
;
and
the
name
come
again
as
a
cry
that
would
have
disturb
me
in
the
bosom
of

,
and
make
me
yearn
to
reach
where
that
sorrow

Ezra

<EOS>
"
  
Mordecai
pause
again
,
his
imagination
arrest
by
the
grasp
of
that
long

pass
moment
.
<EOS>
Deronda
's
mind
be
almost
breathlessly
suspend
on
what
be

<EOS>
a
strange
possibility
have
suddenly
present
itself
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
's
eye
be
cast
down
in
abstract
contemplation
,
and
in
a
few

he
go
on
    
<EOS>
"
She

in

I
understand
the
meaning

perceive
the
footstep
of
his

rise
up
and
say
,
"
the
Majesty

<EOS>
and
that
letter
be
her
cry
from
the
depth

anguish

<EOS>
"
 
here
Mordecai
lift
his
eye
suddenly
,
lay
his
hand
on
Deronda
's
arm
,
and
say
,
"
Mine

<EOS>
at

for
the
beating

in

<EOS>
in

of

then
I
rise

we

We
pour
forth
our

himself
that

after

awhile

It

hardly
four

what
be
the

<EOS>
they
be
far
off

here
<EOS>
Mordecai
again
rest
his
hand
on
Deronda
's
arm
,
and
look
at
him
with
that
joy
of
the
hectic
patient
which
pierce
us
to
sadness
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
to
wail
in
the
withering
of

the

will
be

I

I

<EOS>
I

"
  
<EOS>
His
grasp
have
become
convulsive
in
its
force
,
and
Deronda
,
agitate
as
he
have
never
be
before
 
<EOS>
the
certainty
that
this
be
Mirah
's
brother
suffuse
his
own
strange
relation
to
Mordecai
with
a
new
solemnity
and
tenderness
 
feel
his
strong
young
heart
beat
faster
and
his
lip
pale
.
<EOS>
He
shrink
from
speech
.
<EOS>
He
fear
,
in
Mordecai
's
present
state
of
exaltation
(
already
an
alarming
strain
on
his
feeble
frame
)
,
to
utter
a
word
of
revelation
about
Mirah
.
<EOS>
He
fear
to
make
an
answer
below
that
high
pitch
of
expectation
which
resemble
a
flash
from
a
die
fire
,
make
watcher
fear
to
see
it
die
the
fast
.
<EOS>
His
dominant
impulse
be
to
do
as
he
have
once
do
before
:
he
lay
his
firm
,
gentle
hand
on
the
hand
that
grasp
him
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
's
,
as
if
it
have
a
soul
of
its
own
 
for
he
be
not
distinctly
willing
to
do
what
he
do
 
relax
its
grasp
,
and
turn
upward
under
Deronda
's
.
<EOS>
as
the
two
palm
meet
and
press
each
other
Mordecai
recover
some
sense
of
his
surrounding
,
and
say
    
"
let
us
go
now
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
talk
any
longer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
in
fact
they
part
at
Cohen
's
door
without
have
speak
to
each
other
again
 
merely
with
another
pressure
of
the
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
feel
a
weight
on
him
which
be
half
joy
,
half
anxiety
.
<EOS>
the
joy
of
find
in
Mirah
's
brother
a
nature
even
more
than
worthy
of
that
relation
to
her
,
have
the
weight
of
solemnity
and
sadness
;
the
reunion
of
brother
and
sister
be
in
reality
the
first
stage
of
a
supreme
parting
 
like
that
farewell
kiss
which
resemble
greeting
,
<EOS>
that
last
glance
of
love
which
become
the
sharp
pang
of
sorrow
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
the
weight
of
anxiety
about
the
revelation
of
the
fact
on
both
side
,
and
the
arrangement
it
would
be
desirable
to
make
beforehand
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
should
all
have
feel
as
Deronda
do
,
without
sink
into
snobbishness
or
the
notion
that
the
primal
duty
of
life
demand
a
morning
and
an
evening
suit
,
that
it
be
an
admissible
desire
to
free
Mirah
's
first
meeting
with
her
brother
from
all
jar
outward
condition
.
<EOS>
His
own
sense
of
deliverance
from
the
dreaded
relationship
of
the
other
Cohens
,
notwithstanding
their
good
nature
,
make
him
resolve
if
possible
to
keep
them
in
the
background
for
Mirah
,
until
her
acquaintance
with
them
would
be
an
unmarred
rendering
of
gratitude
for
any
kindness
they
have
show
to
her
brother
.
<EOS>
on
all
account
he
wish
to
give
Mordecai
surrounding
not
only
more
suited
to
his
frail
bodily
condition
,
but
less
of
a
hindrance
to
easy
intercourse
,
even
apart
from
the
decisive
prospect
of
Mirah
's
take
up
her
abode
with
her
brother
,
and
tend
him
through
the
precious
remnant
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
in
the
heroic
drama
,
great
recognition
be
not
encumber
with
these
detail
;
and
certainly
Deronda
have
as
reverential
an
interest
in
Mordecai
and
Mirah
as
he
could
have
have
in
the
offspring
of
Agamemnon
;
but
he
be
care
for
destiny
still
move
in
the
dim
street
of
our
earthly
life
,
not
yet
lift
among
the
constellation
,
and
his
task
present
itself
to
him
as
difficult
and
delicate
,
especially
in
persuade
Mordecai
to
change
his
abode
and
habit
.
<EOS>
concern
Mirah
's
feeling
and
resolve
he
have
no
doubt
:
there
would
be
a
complete
union
of
sentiment
toward
the
depart
mother
,
and
Mirah
would
understand
her
brother
's
greatness
.
<EOS>
yes
,
greatness
:
<EOS>
that
be
the
word
which
Deronda
now
deliberately
choose
to
signify
the
impression
that
Mordecai
have
make
on
him
.
<EOS>
He
say
to
himself
,
perhaps
rather
defiantly
toward
the
more
negative
spirit
within
him
,
that
this
man
,
however
erratic
some
of
his
interpretation
may
be
 
<EOS>
this
consumptive
jewish
workman
in
threadbare
clothing
,
lodge
by
charity
,
deliver
himself
to
hearer
who
take
his
thought
without
attach
more
consequence
to
them
than
the
Flemings
to
the
ethereal
chime
ring
above
their
market
-
place
 
have
the
chief
element
of
greatness
;
a
mind
consciously
,
energetically
move
with
the
large
march
of
human
destinies
,
but
not
the
less
full
of
conscience
and
tender
heart
for
the
footstep
that
tread
near
and
need
a
leaning
-
place
;
capable
of
conceive
and
choose
a
life
's
task
with
far
-
off
issue
,
yet
capable
of
the
unapplauded
heroism
which
turn
off
the
road
of
achievement
at
the
call
of
the
nearer
duty
whose
effect
lie
within
the
beating
of
the
heart
that
be
close
to
us
,
as
the
hunger
of
the
unfledged
bird
to
the
breast
of
its
parent
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
to
-
night
be
stir
with
,
the
feeling
that
the
brief
remnant
of
this
fervid
life
have
become
his
charge
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
peculiarly
work
on
by
what
he
have
see
at
the
club
of
the
friendly
indifference
which
Mordecai
must
have
go
on
encounter
.
<EOS>
His
own
experience
of
the
small
room
that
ardor
can
make
for
itself
in
ordinary
mind
have
have
the
effect
of
increase
his
reserve
;
and
while
tolerance
be
the
easy
attitude
to
him
,
there
be
another
bent
in
him
also
capable
of
become
a
weakness
 
the
dislike
to
appear
exceptional
or
to
risk
an
ineffective
insistance
on
his
own
opinion
.
<EOS>
but
such
caution
appear
contemptible
to
him
just
now
,
when
he
,
for
the
first
time
,
see
in
a
complete
picture
and
feel
as
a
reality
the
life
that
burn
themselves
out
in
solitary
enthusiasm
:
martyr
of
obscure
circumstance
,
exile
in
the
rarity
of
their
own
mind
,
whose
deliverance
in
other
ear
be
no
more
than
a
long
passionate
<EOS>
soliloquy
 
<EOS>
unless
perhaps
at
last
,
when
they
be
near
the
invisible
shore
,
sign
of
recognition
and
fulfilment
may
penetrate
the
cloud
of
loneliness
;
or
perhaps
it
may
be
with
them
as
with
the
die
Copernicus
make
to
touch
the
first
print
copy
of
his
book
when
the
sense
of
touch
be
go
,
see
it
only
as
a
dim
object
through
the
deepen
dusk
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
have
be
bring
near
to
one
of
those
spiritual
exile
,
and
it
be
in
his
nature
to
feel
the
relation
as
a
strong
chain
,
nay
,
to
feel
his
imagination
move
without
repugnance
in
the
direction
of
Mordecai
's
desire
.
<EOS>
with
all
his
latent
objection
to
scheme
only
definite
in
their
generality
and
nebulous
in
detail
 
in
the
poise
of
his
sentiment
he
feel
at
one
with
this
man
who
have
make
a
visionary
selection
of
him
:
the
line
of
what
may
be
call
their
emotional
theory
touch
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
the
jewish
consciousness
,
but
he
have
a
yearning
,
grow
the
strong
for
the
denial
which
have
be
his
grievance
,
after
the
obligation
of
avow
filial
and
social
tie
.
<EOS>
His
feeling
be
ready
for
difficult
obedience
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
it
come
that
he
set
about
his
new
task
ungrudgingly
;
and
again
he
think
of
Mrs.
Meyrick
as
his
chief
helper
.
<EOS>
to
her
first
he
must
make
know
the
discovery
of
Mirah
's
brother
,
and
with
her
he
must
consult
on
all
preliminary
of
bring
the
mutually
lose
together
.
<EOS>
happily
the
good
quarter
for
a
consumptive
patient
do
not
lie
too
far
off
the
small
house
at
Chelsea
,
and
the
first
office
Deronda
have
to
perform
for
this
hebrew
prophet
who
claim
him
as
a
spiritual
inheritor
,
be
to
get
him
a
healthy
lodging
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
irony
of
earthly
mixture
,
that
the
hero
have
not
always
have
carpet
and
teacup
of
their
own
;
and
,
see
through
the
open
window
by
the
mackerel
-
vender
,
may
have
be
invite
with
some
hopefulness
to
pay
three
hundred
per
cent
,
in
the
form
of
fourpence
.
<EOS>
however
,
Deronda
's
mind
be
busy
with
a
prospective
arrangement
for
give
a
furnished
lodging
some
faint
likeness
to
a
refined
home
by
dismantle
his
own
chamber
of
his
good
old
book
in
vellum
,
his
easy
chair
,
and
the
bas
-
relief
of
Milton
and
Dante
.
  
<EOS>
but
be
not
Mirah
to
be
there
?
<EOS>
what
furniture
can
give
such
finish
to
a
room
as
a
tender
woman
's
face
?
 
and
be
there
any
harmony
of
tint
that
have
such
stirring
of
delight
as
the
sweet
modulation
of
her
voice
?
<EOS>
here
be
one
good
,
at
least
,
think
Deronda
,
that
come
to
Mordecai
from
his
have
fix
his
imagination
on
me
.
<EOS>
He
have
recover
a
perfect
sister
,
whose
affection
be
wait
for
him
.
      
<EOS>
Fairy
folk
a
-
listening
  
hear
the
seed
sprout
in
the
spring
.
  
<EOS>
and
for
music
to
their
dance
  
hear
the
hedgerow
wake
from
trance
,
  
Sap
that
tremble
into
bud
  
<EOS>
send
little
rhythmic
flood
  
of
fairy
sound
in
fairy
ear
.
  
<EOS>
thus
all
beauty
that
appear
  
have
birth
as
sound
to
fine
sense
  
and
lighter
-
clothe
intelligence
.
   
<EOS>
and
Gwendolen
?
<EOS>
She
be
think
of
Deronda
much
more
than
he
be
think
of
her
 
often
wonder
what
be
his
idea
"
about
thing
,
"
and
how
his
life
be
occupy
.
<EOS>
but
a
lap
-
dog
would
be
necessarily
at
a
loss
in
frame
to
itself
the
motive
and
adventure
of
doghood
at
large
;
and
it
be
as
far
from
Gwendolen
's
conception
that
Deronda
's
life
could
be
determine
by
the
historical
destiny
of
the
Jews
,
as
that
he
could
rise
into
the
air
on
a
brazen
horse
,
and
so
vanish
from
her
horizon
in
the
form
of
a
twinkle
star
.
  
<EOS>
with
all
the
sense
of
inferiority
that
have
be
force
upon
her
,
it
be
inevitable
that
she
should
imagine
a
large
place
for
herself
in
his
thought
than
she
actually
possess
.
<EOS>
They
must
be
rather
old
and
wise
person
who
be
not
apt
to
see
their
own
anxiety
or
elation
about
themselves
reflect
in
other
mind
;
and
Gwendolen
,
with
her
youth
and
inward
solitude
,
may
be
excuse
for
dwell
on
sign
of
special
interest
in
her
show
by
the
one
person
who
have
impress
her
with
the
feeling
of
submission
,
and
for
mistake
the
color
and
proportion
of
those
sign
in
the
mind
of
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
what
would
he
tell
her
that
she
ought
to
do
?
"
<EOS>
He
say
,
I
must
get
more
interest
in
other
,
and
more
knowledge
,
and
that
I
must
care
about
the
good
thing
 
but
how
be
I
to
begin
?
"
<EOS>
She
wonder
what
book
he
would
tell
her
to
take
up
to
her
own
room
,
and
recall
the
famous
writer
that
she
have
either
not
look
into
or
have
find
the
most
unreadable
,
with
a
half
-
smile
wish
that
she
could
mischievously
ask
Deronda
if
they
be
not
the
book
call
"
medicine
for
the
mind
.
"
<EOS>
then
she
repent
of
her
sauciness
,
and
when
she
be
safe
from
observation
<EOS>
carry
up
a
miscellaneous
selection
 
Descartes
,
Bacon
,
Locke
,
Butler
,
Burke
,
<EOS>
Guizot
 
know
,
as
a
clever
young
lady
of
education
,
that
these
author
be
ornament
of
mankind
,
feel
sure
that
Deronda
have
read
them
,
and
hope
that
by
dip
into
them
all
in
succession
,
with
her
rapid
understanding
she
may
get
a
point
of
view
nearer
to
his
level
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
astonishing
how
little
time
she
find
for
these
vast
mental
excursion
.
<EOS>
constantly
she
have
to
be
on
the
scene
as
Mrs.
Grandcourt
,
and
to
feel
herself
watch
in
that
part
by
the
exact
eye
of
a
husband
who
have
find
a
motive
to
exercise
his
tenacity
 
that
of
make
his
marriage
answer
all
the
end
he
choose
,
and
with
the
more
completeness
the
more
he
discern
any
opposing
will
in
her
.
<EOS>
and
she
herself
,
whatever
rebellion
may
be
go
on
within
her
,
could
not
have
make
up
her
mind
to
failure
in
her
representation
.
<EOS>
no
feeling
have
yet
reconcile
her
for
a
moment
to
any
act
,
word
,
or
look
that
would
be
a
confession
to
the
world
:
and
what
she
most
dread
in
herself
be
any
violent
impulse
that
would
make
an
involuntary
confession
:
it
be
the
will
to
be
silent
in
every
other
direction
that
have
throw
the
more
impetuosity
into
her
confidence
toward
Deronda
,
to
whom
her
thought
continually
turn
as
a
help
against
herself
.
<EOS>
Her
riding
,
her
hunting
,
her
visit
and
receiving
of
visit
,
be
all
perform
in
a
spirit
of
achievement
which
serve
instead
of
z
and
young
gladness
,
so
that
all
around
Diplow
,
in
those
week
of
the
new
year
,
Mrs.
Grandcourt
be
regard
as
wear
her
honor
with
triumph
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
disguise
it
under
an
air
of
take
everything
as
a
matter
of
course
,
"
say
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
.
<EOS>
"
a
stranger
may
suppose
that
she
have
condescend
rather
than
rise
.
<EOS>
I
always
notice
that
doubleness
in
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
to
her
mother
most
of
all
Gwendolen
be
bent
on
act
complete
satisfaction
,
and
poor
Mrs.
Davilow
be
so
far
deceive
that
she
take
the
unexpected
distance
at
which
she
be
keep
,
in
spite
of
what
she
feel
to
be
Grandcourt
's
handsome
behavior
in
provide
for
her
,
as
a
comparative
indifference
in
her
daughter
,
now
that
marriage
have
create
new
interest
.
<EOS>
to
be
fetch
to
lunch
and
then
to
dinner
along
with
the
gascoigne
,
to
be
drive
back
soon
after
breakfast
the
next
morning
,
and
to
have
brief
call
from
Gwendolen
in
which
her
husband
wait
for
her
outside
either
on
horseback
or
sit
in
the
carriage
,
be
all
the
intercourse
allow
to
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
that
the
second
time
Gwendolen
propose
to
invite
her
mother
with
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gascoigne
,
Grandcourt
have
at
first
be
silent
,
and
then
drawl
,
"
We
can
not
be
have
_
those
people
_
always
.
<EOS>
gascoigne
talk
too
much
.
<EOS>
country
clergy
be
always
bore
 
with
their
confound
fuss
about
everything
.
"
  
<EOS>
that
speech
be
full
of
forebode
for
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
to
have
her
mother
class
under
"
those
people
"
be
enough
to
confirm
the
previous
dread
of
bring
her
too
near
.
<EOS>
still
,
she
could
not
give
the
true
reason
 
<EOS>
she
could
not
say
to
her
mother
,
"
Mr.
Grandcourt
want
to
recognize
you
as
little
as
possible
;
and
besides
it
be
well
you
should
not
see
much
of
my
married
life
,
else
you
may
find
out
that
I
be
miserable
.
"
<EOS>
so
she
waive
as
lightly
as
she
could
every
allusion
to
the
subject
;
and
when
Mrs.
Davilow
again
hint
the
possibility
of
her
have
a
house
close
to
Ryelands
<EOS>
,
Gwendolen
say
,
"
It
would
not
be
so
nice
for
you
as
be
near
the
rectory
here
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
We
shall
perhaps
be
very
little
at
ryeland
.
<EOS>
You
would
miss
my
aunt
and
uncle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
all
the
while
this
contemptuous
veto
of
her
husband
be
on
any
intimacy
with
her
family
,
make
her
proudly
shrink
from
give
them
the
aspect
of
troublesome
pensioner
,
be
rouse
more
inward
inclination
toward
them
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
feel
so
kindly
toward
her
uncle
,
so
much
disposed
to
look
back
on
his
cheerful
,
complacent
activity
and
spirit
of
kind
management
,
even
when
mistaken
,
as
more
of
a
comfort
than
the
neutral
loftiness
which
be
every
day
chill
her
.
<EOS>
and
here
perhaps
she
be
unconsciously
find
some
of
that
mental
enlargement
which
it
be
hard
to
get
from
her
occasional
dash
into
difficult
author
,
who
instead
of
blend
themselves
with
her
daily
agitation
require
her
to
dismiss
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
delightful
surprise
one
day
when
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gascoigne
be
at
offendene
to
see
Gwendolen
ride
up
without
her
husband
 
with

the
four
girl
and
Miss
Merry

in
the
dining

room
at
lunch

could
see
the
welcome
approach
;
and
even
the
eld
one
be
not
without
something
of
Isabel
's
romantic
sense
that
the
beautiful
sister
on
the
splendid
chestnut
,
which
hold
its
head
as
if
proud
to
bear
her
,
be
a
sort
of
Harriet
Byron
or
Miss

reappear
out
of
her

happiness
ever
after

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
uncle
go
to
the
door
to
give
her
his
hand
,
and
she
spring
from
her
horse
with
an
air
of
alacrity
which
may
well
encourage
that
notion
of
guarantee
happiness
;
for
Gwendolen
be
particularly
bent
to
-
day
on
set
her
mother
's
heart
at
rest
,
and
her
unusual
sense
of
freedom
in

to
make
this
visit

enable
her
to
bear
up
under
the
pressure

painful
fact

themselves
anew

<EOS>
the
seven
family
kiss
be
not
so
tiresome
as
they
use
to
be

<EOS>
"
Mr.

so
I

fill
up

say
Gwendolen
,
as
she
lay
down
her
hat
and
seat
herself
next
to
her
mother
;
and
then
look
at
her
with
a
playfully
monitory
air
,
"
that
be
a
punishment
to
you
for
not

You

I
wish
there

something

You

<EOS>
Miss

immediately
rise
and
go
out
,

Gwendolen
say
,
"

no

one
of
those
hard

"
It

rather
early

Mrs.

Mr.

I

You

She

devour
with
their
eye
every
movement

soon
to
vanish

<EOS>
"
yes

"

Gwendolen
,
in
a
tone
of
assent
to
the
interest
of
that
expectation

"
<EOS>
and
there
be
so
much
to
be
see
and
do
in
town

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
my
dear
Gwendolen
,
"
say
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
in
a
kind
of
cordial
advice
,
"
that
you
would
use
your
influence
with
Mr.
Grandcourt
to
induce
him
to
enter
Parliament
.
<EOS>
a
man
of
his
position
should
make
his
weight
feel
in
politic
.
<EOS>
the
good
judge
be
confident
that
the
ministry
will
have
to
appeal
to
the
country
on
this
question
of
further
Reform
,
and
Mr.
Grandcourt
should
be
ready
for
the
opportunity
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
quite
sure
that
his
opinion
and
mine
accord
entirely
<EOS>
;
I
have
not
hear
him
express
himself
very
fully
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
look
at
the
matter
from
that
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
I
be
think
of
your
husband
's
standing
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
now
come
to
that
stage
of
life
when
a
man
like
him
should
enter
into
public
affair
.
<EOS>
a
wife
have
great
influence
with
her
husband
.
<EOS>
use
yours
in
that
direction
,
my
dear
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
rector
feel
that
he
be
acquit
himself
of
a
duty
here
,
and
give
something
like
the
aspect
of
a
public
benefit
to
his
niece
's
match
.
<EOS>
to
Gwendolen
the
whole
speech
have
the
flavor
of
bitter
comedy
.
<EOS>
if
she
have
be
merry
,
she
must
have
laugh
at
her
uncle
's
explanation
to
her
that
he
have
not
hear
Grandcourt
express
himself
very
fully
on
politic
.
<EOS>
and
the
wife
's
great
influence
!
<EOS>
general
maxim
about
husband
and
wife
seem
now
of
a
precarious
usefulness
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
herself
have
once
believe
in
her
future
influence
as
an
omnipotence
in
manage
 
<EOS>
she
do
not
know
exactly
what
.
<EOS>
but
her
chief
concern
at
present
be
to
give
an
answer
that
would
be
feel
appropriate
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
very
glad
,
uncle
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
Mr.
Grandcourt
would
not
like
the
trouble
of
an
election
 
at
least
,
unless
it
could
be
without
his
make
speech

<EOS>
I
think
candidate
always
make
speech
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
necessarily
 
to
any
great
extent
,
"
say
Mr.
Gascoigne
.
<EOS>
"
a
man
of
position
and
weight
can
get
on
without
much
of
it

<EOS>
a
county
member
nee
have
very
little
trouble
in
that
way
,
and
both
out
of
the
House
and
in
it
be
like
the
well
for
not
be
a
speechifier
.
<EOS>
tell
Mr.
Grandcourt
that
I
say
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
here
come
Jocosa
with
my
chocolate
after
all
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
escape
from
a
promise
to
give
information
that
would
certainly
have
be
receive
in
a
way
inconceivable
to
the
good
rector
,
who
,
push
his
chair
a
little
aside
from
the
table
and
cross
his
leg
,
look
as
well
as
if
he
feel
like
a
worthy
speciman
of
a
clergyman
and
magistrate
give
experienced
advice
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
Grandcourt
be
a
proud
man
,
but
his
own
self
-
love
,
calm
through
life
by
the
consciousness
of
his
general
value
and
personal
advantage
,
be
not
irritable
enough
to
prevent
him
from
hope
the
good
about
his
niece
's
husband
because
her
uncle
be
keep
rather
haughtily
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
a
certain
aloofness
must
be
allow
to
the
representative
of
an
old
family
;
you
would
not
expect
him
to
be
on
intimate
term
even
with
abstraction
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Gascoigne
be
less
dispassionate
on
her
husband
's
account
,
and
feel
Grandcourt
's
haughtiness
as
something
a
little
blameable
in
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
uncle
and
Anna
will
very
likely
be
in
town
about
Easter
,
"
she
say
,
with
a
vague
sense
of
express
a
slight
discontent
.
"
<EOS>
dear
Rex
hope
to
come
out
with
honor
and
a
fellowship
,
and
he
want
his
father
and
Anna
to
meet
him
in
London
,
that
they
may
be
jolly
together
,
as
he
say
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
wonder
if
Lord
Brackenshaw
invite
them
,
he
have
be
so
very
kind
since
he
come
back
to
the
Castle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
my
uncle
will
bring
Ann
to
stay
in
Grosvenor
Square
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
risk
herself
so
far
,
for
the
sake
of
the
present
moment
,
but
in
reality
wish
that
she
may
never
be
oblige
to
bring
any
of
her

near
Grandcourt
again

<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
of
Rex

good
fortune

We
must
not

premature

rejoice
too
much
beforehand

say
the
rector
,
to
whom
this
topic
be
the
happy
in
the
world

altogether
allowable

now
that
the
issue
of
that
little
affair

be
so
satisfactory

not

We

"
how
very
nice

"
say
Gwendolen
,
with
a
conceal
scepticism
as
to
niceness
in
general
,
which
make
the
word
quite
applicable
to
lawyer

talk
of

just
what
I

small

with
nothing
hideous
to
make
you
miserable

about

a

against
her

but
you

I

They

"
why

except
marry
Mr.
Grandcourt

"
say
Gwendolen
,
start
up
with
a
desperate
resolve
to
be
playful
,
and
keep
no
more
on
the
perilous
edge
of
agitation

<EOS>
"
and
I
should
not
have
do
that
unless
it

myself

<EOS>
She
toss
up
her

and
reach
her

<EOS>
"
God
forbid
,
child
!
<EOS>
I
would
not

"
  
"
very
well

arrange
her
hat
fastidiously

"
then
you
will
please
to
consider
that
you
be
half
happy

which
be
more
than
I

"
<EOS>
with
the
last
word
she
again
turn
with
her
old
playful
smile
to
her
mother
.
<EOS>
"
now
I
be
ready
;
but
oh
,
mamma
,
Mr.
Grandcourt
give
me
a
quantity
of
money
,
and
expect
me
to
spend
it
,
and
I
can
not
spend
it
;
and
you
know
I
can
not
bear
charity
child
and
all
that
;
and
here
be
thirty
pound
.
<EOS>
I
wish
the
girl
would
spend
it
for
me
on
little
thing
for
themselves
when
you
go
to
the
new
house
.
<EOS>
tell
them
so
.
"
<EOS>
Gwendolen
put
the
note
into
her
mother
's
hand
and
look
away
hastily
,
move
toward
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
dear
,
"
say
Mrs.
Davilow
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
please
them
so
that
you
should
have
think
of
them
in
particular

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
they
be
troublesome
thing
;
but
they
do
not
trouble
me
now
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
turn
and
nod
playfully
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
understand
her
own
feeling
in
this
act
toward
her
sister
,
but
at
any
rate
she
do
not
wish
it
to
be
take
as
anything
serious
.
<EOS>
She
be
glad
to
have
get
out
of
the
bedroom
without
show
more
sign
of
emotion
,
and
she
go
through
the
rest
of
her
visit
and
all
the
good
-
bye
with
a
quiet
propriety
that
make
her
say
to
herself
sarcastically
as
she
ride
away
,
"
I
think
I
be
make
a
very
good
Mrs.
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
believe
that
her
husband
have
go
to
Gadsmere
<EOS>
that
day
 
have
infer
this
,
as
she
have
long
ago
infer
who
be
the
inmate
of
what
he
have
describe
as
"
a
dog
-
hutch
of
a
place
in
a
black
country
;
"
and
the
strange
conflict
of
feeling
within
her
have
have
the
characteristic
effect
of
send
her
to
Offendene
with
a
tighten
resolve
 
a
form
of
excitement
which
be
native
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
wonder
at
her
own
contradiction
.
<EOS>
why
should
she
feel
it
bitter
to
her
that
Grandcourt
show
concern
for
the
being
on
whose
account
she
herself
be
undergo
remorse
?
<EOS>
have
she
not
before
her
marriage
inwardly
determine
to
speak
and
act
on
their
behalf
?
 
<EOS>
and
since
he
have
lately
imply
that
he
want
to
be
in
town
because
he
be
make
arrangement
about
his
will
,
she
ought
to
have
be
glad
of
any
sign
that
he
keep
a
conscience
awake
toward
those
at
Gadsmere
;
and
<EOS>
yet
,
now
that
she
be
a
wife
,
the
sense
that
Grandcourt
be
go
to
Gadsmere
be
like
red
heat
near
a
burn
.
<EOS>
She
have
bring
on
herself
this
indignity
in
her
own
eye
 
<EOS>
this
humiliation
of
be
doom
to
a
terrified
silence
lest
her
husband
should
discover
with
what
sort
of
consciousness
she
have
marry
him
;
and
as
she
have
say
to
Deronda
,
she
"
must
go
on
.
"
<EOS>
after
the
intense
moment
of
secret
hatred
toward
this
husband
who
from
the
very
first
have
cow
her
,
there
always
come
back
the
spiritual
pressure
which
make
submission
inevitable
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
effort
at
freedom
that
would
not
bring
fresh
and
bad
humiliation
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
could
dare
nothing
except
an
impulsive
action
 
least
of
all
could
she
dare
premeditatedly
a
vague
future
in
which
the
only
certain
condition
be
indignity
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
remorse
,
it
still
seem
the
bad
result
of
her
marriage
that
she
should
in
any
way
make
a
spectacle
of
herself
;
and
her
humiliation
be
lighten
by
her
thinking
that
only
Mrs.
Glasher
be
aware
of
the
fact
which
cause
it
.
<EOS>
for
Gwendolen
have
never
refer
the
interview
at
the
Whispering
Stones
to
Lush
's
agency
;
her
disposition
to
vague
terror
investing
with
shadowy
omnipresence
<EOS>
any
threat
of
fatal
power
over
her
,
and
so
hinder
her
from
imagine
plan
and
channel
by
which
news
have
be
convey
to
the
woman
who
have
the
poisoning
skill
of
a
sorceress
.
<EOS>
to
Gwendolen
's
mind
the
secret
lay
with
Mrs.
Glasher
,
and
there
be
word
in
the
horrible
letter
which
imply
that
Mrs.
Glasher
would
dread
disclosure
to
the
husband
,
as
much
as
the
usurping
Mrs.
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
something
else
,
too
,
she
think
of
as
more
of
a
secret
from
her
husband
than
it
really
be
 
namely
that
suppress
struggle
of
desperate
rebellion
which
she
herself
dread
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
could
not
indeed
fully
imagine
how
thing
affect
Gwendolen
:
he
have
no
imagination
of
anything
in
her
but
<EOS>
what
affect
the
gratification
of
his
own
will
;
but
on
this
point
he
have
the
sensibility
which
seem
like
divination
.
<EOS>
what
we
see
exclusively
we
be
apt
to
see
with
some
mistake
of
proportion
;
and
Grandcourt
be
not
likely
to
be
infallible
in
his
judgment
concern
this
wife
who
be
govern
by
many
shadowy
power
,
to
him
nonexistent
.
<EOS>
He
magnify
her
inward
resistance
,
but
that
do
not
lessen
his
satisfaction
in
the
mastery
of
it
.
      
<EOS>
Behold
my
lady
's
carriage
stop
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
with
powder
lacquey
and
with
charming
bay
;
  
She
sweep
the
matting
,
tread
the
crimson
stair
.
  
<EOS>
Her
arduous
function
solely
"
to
be
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
like
Sirius
rise
o'er
the
silent
sea
.
  
<EOS>
She
hide
her
heart
in
lustre
loftily
.
   
<EOS>
so
the
Grandcourts
be
in
Grosvenor
Square
in
time
to
receive
a
card
for
the
musical
party
at
Lady
Mallinger
's
,
there
be
reason
of
business
which
make
Sir
Hugo
know
beforehand
that
his
ill
-
beloved
nephew
be
come
up
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
the
third
evening
after
their
arrival
,
and
Gwendolen
make
rather
an
absent
-
minded
acquaintance
with
her
new
ceiling
and
furniture
,
preoccupy
with
the
certainty
that
she
be
go
to
speak
to
Deronda
again
,
and
also
to
see
the
Miss
Lapidoth
who
have
go
through
so
much
,
and
be
"
capable
of
submit
to
anything
in
the
form
of
duty
.
<EOS>
"
for
Gwendolen
have
remember
nearly
every
word
that
Deronda
have
say
about
Mirah
,
and
especially
that
phrase
,
which
she
repeat
to
herself
bitterly
,
have
an
ill
-
define
consciousness
that
her
own
submission
be
something
very
different
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
be
oblige
to
allow
,
if
any
one
have
say
it
to
her
,
that
what
she
submit
to
could
not
take
the
shape
of
duty
,
but
be
submission
to
a
yoke
draw
on
her
by
an
action
she
be
ashamed
of
,
and
wear
with
a
strength
of
selfish
motive
that
leave
no
weight
for
duty
to
carry
.
  
<EOS>
the
drawing
-
room
in
Park
Lane
,
all
white
,
gold
,
and
pale
crimson
,
be
agreeably
furnish
,
and
not
crowd
with
guest
,
before
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Grandcourt
enter
;
and
more
than
half
an
hour
of
instrumental
music
be
be
follow
by
an
interval
of
movement
and
chat
.
<EOS>
Klesmer
be
there
with
his
wife
,
and
in
his
generous
interest
for
Mirah
he
propose
to
accompany
her
singing
of
Leo
's
"
_
o
patria
mia
_
,
"
<EOS>
which
he
have
before
recommend
her
to
choose
,
as
more
distinctive
of
her
than
better
know
music
.
<EOS>
He
be
already
at
the
piano
,
and
Mirah
be
stand
there
conspicuously
,
when
Gwendolen
,
magnificent
in
her
pale
green
velvet
and
poison
diamond
,
be
usher
to
a
seat
of
honor
well
in
view
of
them
.
<EOS>
with
her
long
sight
and
self
-
command
<EOS>
she
have
the
rare
power
of
quickly
distinguish
person
and
object
on
enter
a
full
room
,
and
while
turn
her
glance
toward
Mirah
she
do
not
neglect
to
exchange
a
bow
with
Klesmer
as
she
pass
.
<EOS>
the
smile
seem
to
each
a
lightning
-
flash
back
on
that
morning
when
it
have
be
her
ambition
to
stand
as
the
"
little
Jewess
"
be
stand
,
and
survey
a
grand
audience
from
the
high
rank
of
her
talent
 
instead
of
which
she
be
one
of
the
ordinary
crowd
in
silk
and
gem
,
whose
utmost
performance
it
must
be
to
admire
or
find
fault
.
"
<EOS>
He
think
I
be
in
the
right
road
now
,
"
say
the
lurk
resentment
within
her
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
have
not
catch
sight
of
Deronda
in
her
passage
,
and
while
she
be
seat
acquit
herself
in
chat
with
Sir
Hugo
,
she
glance
round
her
with
careful
ease
,
bow
a
recognition
here
and
there
,
and
fearful
lest
an
anxious
-
look
exploration
in
search
of
Deronda
may
be
observe
by
her
husband
,
and
afterward
rebuke
as
something
"
damnably
vulgar
.
<EOS>
"
but
all
travel
,
even
that
of
a
slow
gradual
glance
round
a
room
,
bring
a
liability
to
undesired
encounter
,
and
amongst
the
eye
that
meet
Gwendolen
's
,
force
her
into
a
slight
bow
,
be
those
of
the
"
amateur
too
fond
of
Meyerbeer
,
"
Mr.
Lush
,
whom
Sir
Hugo
continue
to
find
useful
as
a
half
-
caste
among
gentleman
.
<EOS>
He
be
stand
near
her
husband
,
who
,
however
,
turn
a
shoulder
toward
him
,
and
be
be
understand
to
listen
to
Lord
Pentreath
.
<EOS>
how
be
it
that
at
this
moment
,
for
the
first
time
,
there
dart
through
Gwendolen
,
like
a
disagreeable
sensation
,
the
idea
that
this
man
know
all
about
her
husband
's
life
?
<EOS>
He
have
be
banish
from
her
sight
,
accord
to
her
will
,
and
she
have
be
satisfy
;
he
have
sink
entirely
into
the
background
of
her
thought
,
screen
away
from
her
by
the
agitate
figure
that
keep
up
an
inward
drama
in
which
Lush
have
no
place
.
<EOS>
here
suddenly
he
reappear
at
her
husband
's
elbow
,
and
there
spring
up
in
her
,
like
an
instantaneously
fabricate
memory
in
a
dream
,
the
sense
of
his
be
connect
with
the
secret
that
make
her
wretched
.
<EOS>
She
be
conscious
of
effort
in
turn
her
head
away
from
him
,
try
to
continue
her
wander
survey
as
if
she
have
see
nothing
of
more
consequence
than
the
picture
on
the
wall
,
till
she
discover
Deronda
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
not
look
toward
her
,
and
she
withdraw
her
eye
from
him
,
without
have
get
any
recognition
,
console
herself
with
the
assurance
that
he
must
have
see
her
come
in
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
he
be
not
stand
far
from
the
door
with
Hans
Meyrick
,
whom
he
have
be
careful
to
bring
into
Lady
Mallinger
's
list
.
<EOS>
They
be
both
a
little
more
anxious
than
be
comfortable
lest
Mirah
should
not
be
hear
to
advantage
.
<EOS>
Deronda
even
feel
himself
on
the
brink
of
betraying
emotion
,
Mirah
's
presence
now
be
link
with
crowd
image
of
what
have
go
before
and
be
to
come
after
 
all
center
in
the
brother
<EOS>
he
be
soon
to
reveal
to
her
;
and
he
have
escape
as
soon
as
he
could
from
the
side
of
Lady
Pentreath
,
who
have
say
in
her
violoncello
voice
    
"
<EOS>
well
,
your
Jewess
be
pretty
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
deny
that
.
<EOS>
but
where
be
her
jewish
impudence
?
<EOS>
She
look
as
demure
as
a
nun
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
learn
that
on
the
stage
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
begin
to
feel
on
Mirah
's
behalf
something
of
what
he
have
feel
for
himself
in
his
seraphic
boyish
time
,
when
Sir
Hugo
ask
him
if
he
would
like
to
be
a
great
singer
 
<EOS>
an
indignant
dislike
to
her
be
remark
on
in
a
free
and
easy
way
,
as
if
she
be
an
import
commodity
disdainfully
pay
for
by
the
fashionable
public
,
and
he
wince
the
more
because
Mordecai
,
he
know
,
would
feel
that
the
name
"
Jewess
"
be
take
as
a
sort
of
stamp
like
the
lettering
of
chinese
silk
.
<EOS>
in
this
susceptible
mood
he
see
the
Grandcourts
enter
,
and
be
immediately
appeal
to
by
han
about
"
that
Vandyke
duchess
of
a
beauty
.
"
<EOS>
pray
excuse
Deronda
that
in
this
moment
he
feel
a
transient
renewal
of
his
first
repulsion
from
Gwendolen
,
as
if
she
and
her
beauty
and
her
failing
be
to
blame
for
the
undervaluing
of
Mirah
as
a
woman
 
a
feel
something
like
class
animosity
,
which
affection
for
what
be
not
fully
recognize
by
other
,
whether
in
person
or
in
poetry
,
rarely
allow
us
to
escape
.
<EOS>
to
han
admire
Gwendolen
with
his
habitual
hyperbole
,
he
answer
,
with
a
sarcasm
that
be
not
quite
good
-
natured
    
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
could
admire
no
style
of
woman
but
your
Berenice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
style
I
worship
 
not
admire

say
Hans
.
<EOS>
"
other
style
of
woman
I
may
make
myself
wicked
for

but
for
Berenice
I
could
make
myself
 
well

pretty
good

which
be
something
much
more
difficult
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
"
say
Deronda
,
under
the
pretext
that
the
singing
be
go
to
begin
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
so
delighted
with
the
answer
as
may
have
be
expect
,
and
be
relieve
by
Hans
's
movement
to
a
more
advanced
spot
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
have
never
before
hear
Mirah
sing
"
_
o
patria
mia
_
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
know
well
Leopardi
's
fine
Ode
to
Italy
(
when
Italy
sit
like
a
disconsolate
mother
in
chain
,
hide
her
face
on
her
knee
and
weeping
)
,
and
the
few
select
word
be
fill
for
him
with
the
grandeur
of
the
whole
,
which
seem
to
breath
an
inspiration
through
the
music
.
<EOS>
Mirah
singe
this
,
make
Mordecai
more
than
ever
one
presence
with
her
.
<EOS>
certain
word
not
include
in
the
song
nevertheless
ring
within
Deronda
as
harmony
from
the
invisible
            
"
Non
ti
difende
  
Nessun
dè
tuoi
!
<EOS>
L'armi
,
qua
l'armi

<EOS>
io
solo

Combatteró

]
  
<EOS>
they
seem
the
very
voice
of
that
heroic
passion
which
be
falsely
say
to
devote
itself
in
vain
when
it
achieve
the
god
-
like
end
of
manifest
unselfish
love
.
<EOS>
and
that
passion
be
present
to
Deronda
now
as
the
vivid
image
of
a
man
die
helplessly
away
from
the
possibility
of
battle
.
  
<EOS>
Mirah
be
equal
to
his
wish
.
<EOS>
while
the
general
applause
be
sound
,
Klesmer
give
a
more
value
testimony
,
audible
to
her
<EOS>
only
 
"
good
,
good
 
the
crescendo
better
than
before
.
<EOS>
"
but
her
chief
anxiety
be
to
know
that
she
have
satisfy
Mr.
Deronda
:
<EOS>
any
failure
on
her
part
this
evening
would
have
pain
her
as
an
especial
injury
to
him
.
<EOS>
of
course
all
her
prospect
be
due
to
what
he
have
do
for
her
;
still
,
this
occasion
of
singe
in
the
house
that
be
his
home
bring
a
peculiar
demand
.
<EOS>
She
look
toward
him
in
the
distance
,
and
he
see
that
she
do
;
but
he
remain
where
he
be
,
and
watch
the
stream
of
emulous
admirer
close
round
her
,
till
presently
they
part
to
make
way
for
Gwendolen
,
who
be
take
up
to
be
introduce
by
Mrs.
Klesmer
.
<EOS>
easy
now
about
"
the
little
Jewess
,
"
Daniel
relent
toward
poor
Gwendolen
in
her
splendor
,
and
his
memory
go
back
,
with
some
penitence
for
his
momentary
hardness
,
over
all
the
sign
and
confession
that
she
too
need
a
rescue
,
and
one
much
more
difficult
than
that
of
the
wanderer
by
the
river
 
a
rescue
for
which
he
feel
himself
helpless
.
<EOS>
the
silent
question
 
<EOS>
"
but
be
it
not
cowardly
to
make
that
a
reason
for
turn
away
?
"
be
the
form
in
which
he
frame
his
resolve
to
go
near
her
on
the
first
opportunity
,
and
show
his
regard
for
her
past
confidence
,
in
spite
of
Sir
Hugo
's
unwelcome
hint
.
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
,
have
rise
to
Gwendolen
as
she
approach
,
and
be
include
by
her
in
the
opening
conversation
with
Mirah
,
continue
near
them
a
little
while
,
look
down
with
a
smile
,
which
be
rather
in
his
eye
than
on
his
lip
,
at
the
piquant
contrast
of
the
two
charming
young
creature
seat
on
the
red
divan
.
<EOS>
the
solicitude
seem
to
be
all
on
the
side
of
the
splendid
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
let
me
say
how
much
I
be
oblige
to
you
,
"
say
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
from
Mr.
Deronda
that
I
should
have
a
great
treat
in
your
singing
,
but
I
be
too
ignorant
to
imagine
how
great
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
good
to
say
so
,
"
answer
Mirah
,
her
mind
chiefly
occupy
in
contemplate
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
It
be
like
a
new
kind
of
stage
-
experience
to
her
to
be
close
to
genuine
grand
lady
with
genuine
brilliant
and
complexion
,
and
they
impress
her
vaguely
as
come
out
of
some
unknown
drama
,
in
which
their
part
perhaps
get
more
tragic
as
they
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
all
want
to
learn
of
you
 
<EOS>
I
,
at
least
,
"

Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
I
sing
very
badly
,
as
Herr
Klesmer
will
tell
you
,
"
 
here
she
glance
upward
to
that
high
power
rather
archly
,
and
continue
 
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
be
rebuke
for
not
like
to
middle
,
since
I
can
be
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
be
a
different
doctrine
from
yours
?
<EOS>
"
She
be
still
look
at
Klesmer
,
who
say
quickly
    
"
not
if
it
mean
that
it
would
be
worth
while
for
you
to
study
further
,
and
for
Miss
Lapidoth
to
have
the
pleasure
of
help
you
.
"
<EOS>
with
that
he
move
away
,
and
Mirah
take
everything
with
_
naïve
_
seriousness
,
say
    
"
if
you
think
I
could
teach
you
,
I
shall
be
very
glad

<EOS>
I
be
anxious
to
teach
,
but
I
have
only
just
begin
.
<EOS>
if
I
do
it
well
,
it
must
be
by
remember
how
my
master
teach
me

"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
be
in
reality
too
uncertain
about
herself
to
be
prepare
for
this
simple
promptitude
of
Mirah
's
,
and
in
her
wish
to
change
the
subject
,
say
,
with
some
lapse
from
the
good
taste
of
her
first
address
    
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
be
long
in
London
,
I
think
?
 
<EOS>
but
you
be
perhaps
introduce
to
Mr.
Deronda
abroad
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Mirah
;
"
I
never
see
him
before
I
come
to
England
in
the
summer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
he
have
see
you
often
and
hear
you
sing
a
great
deal
,
have
he
not
?
"
say
Gwendolen
,
lead
on
partly
by
the
wish
to
hear
anything
about
Deronda
,
and
partly
by
the
awkwardness
which
beset
the
readiest
person
,
in
carry
on
a
dialogue
when
empty
of
matter
.
"
<EOS>
He
speak
of
you
to
me
with
the
high
praise

<EOS>
He
seem
to
know
you
quite
well

<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
be
poor
and
need
help
,
"
say
Mirah
,
in
a
new
tone
of
feeling
,
"
and
Mr.
Deronda
have
give
me
the
good
friend
in
the
world

<EOS>
that
be
the
only
way
he
come
to

anything

I
have
no
friend

I

<EOS>
I
be
in
distress

<EOS>
I
owe
everything
to
him

"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Gwendolen
,
who
have
want
to
be
a
struggle
artist
herself
,
could
nevertheless
not
escape
the
impression
that
a
mode
of
inquiry
which
would
have
be
rather
rude
toward
herself
be
an
amiable
condescension
to
this
Jewess
who
be
ready
to
give
her
lesson
.
<EOS>
the
only
effect
on
Mirah
,
as
always
on
any
mention
of
Deronda
,
be
to
stir
reverential
gratitude
and
anxiety
that
she
should
be
understand
to
have
the
deep
obligation
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
both
he
and
Hans
,
who
be
notice
the
pair
from
a
distance
,
would
have
feel
rather
indignant
if
they
have
know
that
the
conversation
have
lead
up
to
Mirah
's
representation
of
herself
in
this
light
of
neediness
.
<EOS>
in
the
movement
that
prompt
her
,
however
,
there
be
an
exquisite
delicacy
,
which
perhaps
she
could
not
have
state
explicitly
 
the
feeling
that
she
ought
not
to
allow
any
one
to
assume
in
Deronda
a
relation
of
more
equality
or
less
generous
interest
toward
her
than
actually
exist
.
<EOS>
Her
answer
be
delightful
to
Gwendolen
:
she
think
of
nothing
but
the
ready
compassion
which
in
another
form
she
have
trust
in
and
find
herself
;
and
on
the
signal
that
Klesmer
be
about
to
play
she
move
away
in
much
content
,
entirely
without
presentiment
that
this
jewish
_
protégé
_
would
ever
make
a
more
important
difference
in
her
life
than
the
possible
improvement
of
her
singing
 
if
the
leisure
and
spirit
of
a
Mrs.
Grandcourt
would
allow
of
other
lesson
than
such
as
the
world
be
give
her
at
rather
a
high
charge
.
  
<EOS>
with
her
wonted
alternation
from
resolute
care
of
appearance
to
some
rash
indulgence
of
an
impulse
,
she
choose
,
under
the
pretext
of
get
farther
from
the
instrument
,
not
to
go
again
to
her
former
seat
,
but
place
herself
on
a
settee
where
she
could
only
have
one
neighbor
.
<EOS>
She
be
near
to
Deronda
than
before
:
be
it
surprising
that
he
come
up
in
time
to
shake
hand
before
the
music
begin
 
then
,
that
after
he
have
stand
<EOS>
a
little
while
by
the
elbow
of
the
settee
at
the
empty
end
,
the
torrent
-
like
confluence
of
bass
and
treble
seem
,
like
a
convulsion
of
nature
,
to
cast
the
conduct
of
petty
mortal
into
insignificance
,
and
to
warrant
his
sit
down
?
  
<EOS>
but
when
at
the
end
of
Klesmer
's
playing
there
come
the
outburst
of
talk
under
which
Gwendolen
have
hope
to
speak
as
she
would
to
Deronda
,
she
observe
that
Mr.
Lush
be
within
hearing
,
lean
against
the
wall
close
by
them
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
help
her
flush
of
anger
,
but
she
try
to
have
only
an
air
of
polite
indifference
in
say
    
"
Miss
Lapidoth
be
everything
you
describe
her
to
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
be
very
quick
in
discover
that
,
"
say
Deronda
,
ironically
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
find
out
all
the
excellency
you
speak
of
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
that
,
"
say
Gwendolen
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
think
her
singing
be
charming
,
and
herself
,
too
.
<EOS>
Her
face
be
lovely
 
not
in
the
least
common
;
and
she
be
such
a
complete
little
person
.
<EOS>
I
should
think
she
will
be
a
great
success
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
speech
be
grate
on
Deronda
,
and
he
would
not
answer
it
,
but
look
gravely
before
him
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
he
be
displeased
with
her
,
and
she
be
get
so
impatient
under
the
neighborhood
of
Mr.
Lush
,
which
prevent
her
from
say
any
word
she
want
to
say
,
that
she
meditate
some
desperate
step
to
get
rid
of
it
,
and
remain
silent
,
too
.
<EOS>
that
constraint
seem
to
last
a
long
while
,
neither
Gwendolen
nor
Deronda
look
at
the
other
,
till
Lush
slowly
relieve
the
wall
of
his
weight
,
and
join
some
one
at
a
distance
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
immediately
say
,
"
You
despise
me
for
talk
artificially
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Deronda
,
look
at
her
coolly
;
"
I
think
that
be
quite
excusable
sometimes
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
think
what
you
be
last
saying
be
altogether
artificial
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
something
in
it
that
displease
you
,
"
say
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
impossible
to
explain
such
thing
,
"
say
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
one
can
never
communicate
nicety
of
feel
about
word
and
manner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
I
be
shut
out
from
understand
them
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
with
a
slight
tremor
in
her
voice
,
which
she
be
try
to
conquer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
I
show
myself
so
very
dense
to
everything
you
have
say
?
<EOS>
"
there
be
an
indescribable
look
of
suppressed
tear
in
her
eye
,
which
be
turn
on
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
,
"
say
Deronda
,
with
some
softening
of
voice
.
"
<EOS>
but
experience
differ
for
different
people
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
all
wince
at
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
plenty
of
proof
that
you
be
not
dense
.
"
<EOS>
He
smile
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
one
may
feel
thing
and
be
not
able
to
do
anything
well
for
all
that
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
not
smile
in
return
 
the
distance
to
which
Deronda
's
word
seem
to
throw
her
chill
her
too
much
.
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
think
we
can
only
get
well
by
have
people
about
us
who
raise
good
feeling
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
be
surprised
at
anything
in
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
too
late
for
me
to
alter
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
to
set
about
be
wise
,
as
you
tell
me
to
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
seldom
find
I
do
any
good
by
my
preaching
.
<EOS>
I
may
as
well
have
keep
from
meddle
,
"
say
Deronda
,
think
rather
sadly
that
his
interference
about
that
unfortunate
necklace
may
end
in
nothing
but
an
add
pain
to
him
in
see
her
after
all
harden
to
another
sort
of
gambling
than
roulette
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
say
that
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
hurriedly
,
feel
that
this
may
be
her
only
chance
of
get
the
word
utter
,
and
dread
the
increase
of
her
own
agitation
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
despair
of
me
,
I
shall
despair
.
<EOS>
Your
saying
that
I
should
not
go
on
be
selfish
and
ignorant
have
be
some
strength
to
me
.
<EOS>
if
you
say
you
wish
you
have
not
meddle
 
that
mean
you
despair
of
me
and
forsake
me
.
<EOS>
and
then
you
will
decide
for
me
that
I
shall
not
be
good
.
<EOS>
It
be
you
who
will
decide
;
because
you
may
have
make
me
different
by
keep
as
near
to
me
as
you
could
,
and
believe
in
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
have
not
be
look
at
him
as
she
speak
,
but
at
the
handle
of
the
fan
which
she
hold
close
.
<EOS>
with
the
last
word
she
rise
and
leave
him
,
return
to
her
former
place
,
which
have
be
leave
vacant
;
while
every
one
be
settle
into
quietude
in
expectation
of
Mirah
's
voice
,
which
presently
,
with
that
wonderful
,
search
quality
of
subdue
song
in
which
the
melody
seem
simply
an
effect
of
the
emotion
,
give
forth
,
_
<EOS>
per
pietà
non

<EOS>
in
Deronda
's
ear
the
strain
be
for
the
moment
a
continuance
of
Gwendolen
's
plead
 
a
painful
urging
of
something
vague
and
difficult
,
irreconcilable
with
press
condition
,

cruel

<EOS>
however
strange
the
mixture
in
her
of
a
resolute
pride
and
a
precocious
air
of
know
the
world
,
with
a
precipitate
,
guileless
indiscretion
,
he
be
quite
sure
now
that

exist
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
's
hint
have
make
him
alive
to
danger
that
his
own
disposition
may
have
neglect
;
but
that
Gwendolen
's
reliance
on
him
be
unvisited
by
any
dream
of
his
be
a
man
who
could
misinterpret
her
be
as
manifest
as
morning
,
and
make
an
appeal
which
wrestle
with
his
sense
of
present
danger
,
and
with
his
foreboding
of
a
grow
incompatible
claim
on
him
in
her
mind
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
foreshadowing
of
some
painful
collision
:
on
the
one
side
the
grasp
of
Mordecai
's
die
hand
on
him
,
with
all
the
ideal
and
prospect
it
arouse
;
on
the
other
the
fair
creature
in
silk
and
gem
,
with
her
hide
wound
and
her
self
-
dread
,
make
a
trustful
effort
to
lean
and
find
herself
sustain
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
he
have
a
vision
of
himself
beseech
with
outstretched
arm
and
cry
,
while
he
be
catch
by
the
wave
and
compel
to
mount
the
vessel
bind
for
a
far
-
off
coast
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
strain
of
excited
feeling
in
him
that
go
along
with
the
note
of
Mirah
's
song
;
but
when
it
cease
he
move
from
his
seat
with
the
reflection
that
he
have
be
fall
into
an
exaggeration
of
his
own
importance
,
and
a
ridiculous
readiness
to
accept
Gwendolen
's
view
of
himself
,
as
if
he
could
really
have
any
decisive
power
over
her
.

"

after

the
time
have
come
to
prepare
Mordecai
for
the
revelation
of
the
restore
sister
and
for
the
change
of
abode
which
be
desirable
before
Mirah
's

<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
to
whom
Deronda
have
confide
everything
except
Mordecai
's
peculiar
relation
to
himself
,
have
be
active
in
help
him
to
find
a
suitable
lodging
in
Brompton
,
not
many
minute

walk
from
her
own
house
,
so
that
the
brother
and
sister
would
be
within
reach
of
her
motherly
care
.
<EOS>
Her
happy
mixture
of
scottish
fervor
and
Gallic
liveliness
have
enable
her
to
keep
the
secret
close
from
the
girl
as
well
as
from
Hans
,
any
betrayal
to
them
be
likely
to
reach
Mirah
in
some
way
that
would
raise
an
agitate
suspicion
,
and
spoil
the
important
opening
of
that
work
which
be
to
secure
her
independence
,
as
we
rather
arbitrarily
call
one
of
the
more
arduous
and
dignified
form
of
our
dependence
.
<EOS>
and
both
Mrs.
Meyrick
and
Deronda
have
more
reason
than
they
could
have
express
for
desire
that
Mirah
should
be
able
to
maintain
herself
.
<EOS>
perhaps
"
the
little
mother
"
be
rather
help
in
her
secrecy
by
some
dubiousness
in
her
sentiment
about
the
remarkable
brother
describe
to
her
;
and
certainly
if
she
feel
any
joy
and
anticipatory
admiration
,
it
be
due
to
her
faith
in
Deronda
's
judgment
.
<EOS>
the
consumption
be
a
sorrowful
fact
that
appeal
to
her
tenderness
;
but
how
be
she
to
be
very
glad
of
an
enthusiasm
which
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
she
could
only
contemplate
as
jewish
pertinacity
,
and
as
rather
an
undesirable
introduction
among
them
all
of
a
man
whose
conversation
would
not
be
more
modern
and
encouraging
than
that
of
Scott
's
Covenanters
?
<EOS>
Her
mind
be
anything
but
prosaic
,
and
have
her
soberer
share
of
Mab
's
delight
in
the
romance
of
Mirah
's
story
and
of
her
abode
with
them
;
but
the
romantic
or
unusual
in
real
life
require
some
adaptation
.
<EOS>
We
sit
up
at
night
to
read
about
Sakya
-
Mouni
,
St.
Francis
,
or
Oliver
Cromwell
;
but
whether
we
should
be
glad
for
any
one
at
all
like
them
to
call
on
us
the
next
morning
,
still
more
,
to
reveal
himself
as
a
new
relation
,
be
quite
another
affair
.
<EOS>
besides
,
Mrs.
Meyrick
have
hope
,
as
her
child
do
,
that
the
intensity
of
Mirah
's
feeling
about
Judaism
would
slowly
subside
,
and
be
merge
in
the
gradually
deepen
current
of
love
interchange
with
her
new
friend
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
her
secret
favorite
continuation
of
the
romance
have
be
no
discovery
of
jewish
relation
,
but
something
much
more
favorable
to
the
hope
she
discern
in
Hans
.
<EOS>
and
now
 
here
be
a
brother
who
would
dip
Mirah
's
mind
over
again
in
the
deep
dye
of
jewish
sentiment
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
help
say
to
Deronda
    
<EOS>
"
I
be
as
glad
as
you
be
that
the
pawnbroker
be
not
her
brother
:
there
be
Ezras
and
Ezras
in
the
world
;
and
really
it
be
a
comfort
to
think
that
all
Jews
be
not
like
those
shopkeeper
who
_
<EOS>
will
not
_
let
you
get
out
of
their
shop
:
and
besides
,
what
he
say
to
you
about
his
mother
and
sister
<EOS>
make
me
bless
him
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
he
be
good
.
<EOS>
but
I
never
do
like
anything
fanatical
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
hear
a
little
too
much
preaching
in
my
youth
and
lose
my
palate
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
you
will
find
that
Mordecai
obtrude
any
preaching
,
"
say
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
not
what
I
should
call
fanatical
.
<EOS>
I
call
a
man
fanatical
when
his
enthusiasm
be
narrow
and
hoodwink
,
so
that
he
have
no
sense
of
proportion
,
and
become
unjust
and
unsympathetic
to
man
who
be
out
of
his
own
track
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
be
an
enthusiast
;
I
should
like
to
keep
that
word
for
the
high
order
of
mind
 
those
who
care
supremely
for
grand
and
general
benefit
to
mankind
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
strictly
orthodox
Jew
,
and
be
full
of
allowance
for
other
;
his
conformity
in
many
thing
be
an
allowance
for
the
condition
of
other
Jews
.
<EOS>
the
people
he
live
with
be
as
fond
of
him
as
possible
,
and
they
can
not
in
the
least
understand
his
idea
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
well
,
I
can
live
up
to
the
level

the

mother

like
him
for
what
I
see
to
be
good
in
him

and
for
what
I
do
not
see
the
merit
of
I
will
take
your
word
.
<EOS>
accord
to
your
definition
,
I
suppose
one
may
be
fanatical
in
worship
common
-
sense
;
for
my
poor
husband
use
to
say
the
world
would
be
a
poor
place
if
there
be
nothing
but
common
-
sense
in
it
.
<EOS>
however
,
Mirah
's
brother
will
have
good
bedding
 
<EOS>
that
I
have
take
care
of
;
and
I
shall
have
this
extra
window
paste
up
with
paper
to
prevent
draught
.

<EOS>
(
the
conversation
be
take
place
in

<EOS>
"
It
be
a
comfort
to
think
that
the
people

be
no
stranger

me
 
no
hypocritical
harpy

and
when
the

know
,
we
shall
be
able

make
the
room
much
pretty

the
next
stage
of
the
affair
be
to
tell
all
to
Mordecai

and
get
him
to
move

which
may
be
a
more
difficult
business

Deronda

and
will
you
tell
Mirah
before
I
say
anything
to
the
child

say
Mrs.
Meyrick

<EOS>
but
Deronda
hesitate
,
and
she
go
on
in
a
tone
of
persuasive
deliberation

"
no
,
I
think
not

<EOS>
let
me
tell
Hans
and
the
girl
the
evening
before

they
will
be
away
the
next
morning
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
that
will
be
good
.
<EOS>
but
do
justice
to
my
account
of
Mordecai
 
or
Ezra
,
as
I
suppose
Mirah
will
wish
to
call
him
:
do
not
assist
their
imagination
by
refer
to
Habakkuk
Mucklewrath
,

Deronda

Mrs.

herself
have
use
the
comparison
of
the
Covenanters

<EOS>
"
trust
me
,
trust
me
,

say
the
little
mother
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
to
persuade
them
so
hard
to
be
glad

that
I
shall
convert
myself

<EOS>
when
I
be
frightened
I
find
it
a
good
thing
to
have
somebody
to
be
angry
with
for
not
be
brave
:
it
warm
the
blood

<EOS>
Deronda
may
have
be
more
argumentative
or
persuasive
about
the
view
to
be
take
of
Mirah
's
brother
,
if
he
have
be
less
anxiously
preoccupy
with
the
more
important
task
immediately
before
him
,
which
he
desire
to
acquit
himself
of
without
wound
the
Cohens
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
,
by
a
memorable
answer
,
have
make
it
evident
that
he
would
be
keenly
alive
to
any
inadvertance
in
relation
to
their
feeling
.
<EOS>
in
the
interval
,
he
have
be
meet
Mordecai
at
the
_
Hand
and
Banner
_
,
but
now
after
due
reflection
he
write
to
him
say
that
he
have
particular
reason
for
wish
to
see
him
in
his
own
home
the
next
evening
,
and
would
beg
to
sit
with
him
in
his
workroom
for
an
hour
,
if
the
Cohens
would
not
regard
it
as
an
intrusion
.
<EOS>
He
would
call
with
the
understanding
that
if
there
be
any
objection
,
Mordecai
would
accompany
him
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
Deronda
hope
in
this
way
to
create
a
little
expectation
that
would
have
a
preparatory
effect
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
receive
with
the
usual
friendliness
,
some
additional
costume
in
the
woman
and
child
,
and
in
all
the
elder
a
slight
air
of
wonder
which
even
in
Cohen
be
not
allow
to
pass
the
bound
of
silence
 
<EOS>
the
guest
's
transaction
with
Mordecai
be
a
sort
of
mystery
which
he
be
rather
proud
to
think
lie
outside
the
sphere
of
light
which
enclose
his
own
understanding

but
when
Deronda
say
,
"
I
suppose
Mordecai
be
at
home
and
expect
me
,
"
Jacob
,
who
have
profit
by
the
family
remark
,
go
up
to
his
knee
and
say
,
"
what
do
you
want
to
talk
to
Mordecai
about
?

something
that
be
very
interesting

you

Can
you
say
this

Jacob

immediately
give
forth
a
string
of
his
rote
-
learn
Hebrew
verse
with
a
wonderful
mixture
of
the
throaty
and
the
nasal
,
and
nod
his
small
head
at
his
hearer
,
with
a
sense
of
give
formidable
evidence
which
may
rather
alter
their
mutual
position

<EOS>
"
no

really

say
Deronda
,
keep
grave

a
copying
of
his
father

phrase
,
which
seem
to
him
well
fit
to
cap
the
recitation
of
Hebrew
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
call
back
with
hush
by
mother

grandmother
,
and
Deronda

enter
and
close
the
door
behind
him

see
that
a
bit
of
carpet
have
be
lay
down
,
a
chair
place
,
and
the
fire
and
light
attend
to

as

to

Deronda
be
strike
with
the
air
of
solemn
expectation
in

such
as
would
have
seem
perfectly
natural
if
his
letter
have
declare
that
some
revelation
be
to
be
make
about
the
lost
sister

<EOS>
neither
of
them
speak
,
till
Deronda
,
with
his
usual
tenderness
of
manner
,
have
draw
the
vacant
chair
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
hearth
and
have
seat
himself
near
to
Mordecai

who
then
say
,
in
a
tone
of
fervid
certainty
    
<EOS>
"
You

come
to

something

on

guard

for
something
quite
different
from

I

<EOS>
the
disappointment

inevitable
:
it
be
well
not
to
let
the
feeling
be
strain
longer
in
a
mistaken
hope

<EOS>
Mordecai
sink
back
in

unable

<EOS>
the
whole
day
his

be
in

pause

notice
a
shrink
movement
in
Mordecai
,
he
add
 
"
whom
she
and
you
hold
dear
above
all
other

"
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
,
with
a
sudden
start
,
lay
a
spasmodic
grasp
on
Deronda
's
wrist
;
there
be
a
great
terror
in
him
.
<EOS>
and
Deronda
divine
it
.
<EOS>
a
tremor
be
perceptible
in
his
clear
tone
as
he
say
    
"
what
be
pray
for
have
come
to
pass
:
Mirah
have
be
deliver
from
evil
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
's
grasp
relax
a
little
,
but
he
be
pant
with
a
tearless
sob
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
go
on
:
"
Your
sister
be
worthy
of
the
mother
you
honor
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
wait
there
,
and
Mordecai
,
throw
himself
backward
in
his
chair
,
again
close
his
eye
,
utter
himself
almost
inaudibly
for
some
minute
in
Hebrew
,
and
then
subside
into
a
happy
-
look
silence
.
<EOS>
Deronda
,
watch
the
expression
in
his
uplifted
face
,
could
have
imagine
that
he
be
speak
with
some
beloved
object
:
there
be
a
new
suffuse
sweetness
,
something
like
that
on
the
face
of
the
beautiful
dead
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
Deronda
think
he
discern
a
family
resemblance
to
Mirah
.
  
<EOS>
presently
when
Mordecai
be
ready
to
listen
,
the
rest
be
tell
.
<EOS>
but
in
account
for
Mirah
's
flight
he
make
the
statement
about
the
father
's
conduct
as
vague
as
he
could
,
and
throw
the
emphasis
on
her
yearning
to
come
to
England
as
the
place
where
she
may
find
her
mother
.
<EOS>
also
he
keep
back
the
fact
of
Mirah
's
intention
to
drown
herself
,
and
his
own
part
in
rescue
her
;
merely
describe
the
home
she
have
find
with
friend
of
his
,
whose
interest
in
her
and
effort
for
her
he
have
share
.
<EOS>
what
he
dwell
on
finally
be
Mirah
's
feeling
about
her
mother
and
brother
;
and
in
relation
to
this
he
try
to
give
every
detail
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
in
search
of
them
,
"
say
Deronda
,
smile
,
"
that
I
turn
into
this
house
:
<EOS>
the
name
Ezra
Cohen
be
just
then
the
most
interesting
name
in
the
world
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
confess
I
have
fear
for
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
will
forgive
me
now
for
have
ask
you
that
question
about
the
eld
Mrs.
Cohen
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
I
care
very
much
what
I
should
find
Mirah
's
friend
to
be
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
find
a
brother
worthy
of
her
when
I
know
that
her
Ezra
be
disguise
under
the
name
of
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mordecai
be
really
my
name
 
Ezra
Mordecai
Cohen
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
be
there
any
kinship
between
this
family
and
yours
?
"
say
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
only
the
kinship
of
Israel
.
<EOS>
My
soul
cling
to
these
people
,
who
have
shelter
me
and
give
me
succor
out
of
the
affection
that
abide
in
jewish
heart
,
as
sweet
odor
in
thing
long
crush
and
hide
from
the
outer
air
.
<EOS>
It
be
good
for
me
to
bear
with
their
ignorance
and
be
bind
to
them
in
gratitude
,
that
I
may
keep
in
mind
the
spiritual
poverty
of
the
jewish
million
,
and
not
put
impatient
knowledge
in
the
stead
of
love
wisdom

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
do
not
feel
bind
to
continue
with
them
<EOS>
now
there
be
a
close
tie
to
draw
you
?
"
say
Deronda
,
not
without
fear
that
he
may
find
an
obstacle
to
overcome
.
<EOS>
"
It
seem
to
me
right
now
 
be
it
not
?
 
<EOS>
that
you
should
live
with
your
sister
;
and
I
have
prepare
a
home
to
take
you
to
in
the
neighborhood
of
her
friend
,
that
she
may
join
you
there
.
<EOS>
pray
grant
me
this
wish
.
<EOS>
It
will
enable
me
to
be
with
you
often
in
the
hour
when
Mirah
be
oblige
to
leave
you
.
<EOS>
that
be
my
selfish
reason
.
<EOS>
but
the
chief
reason
be
,
that
Mirah
will
desire
to
watch
over
you
,
and
that
you
ought
to
give
her
the
guardianship
of
a
brother
's
presence
.
<EOS>
You
shall
have
book
about
you
.
<EOS>
I
shall
want
to
learn
of
you
,
and
to
take
you
out
to
see
the
river
and
tree
.
<EOS>
and
you
will
have
the
rest
and
comfort
that
you
will
be
more
and
more
in
need
of
 
nay
,
that
I
need
for
you

this
be
the
claim
I
make
on
you

now
that
we
have
find
each
other

"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
speak
in
a
tone
of
earnest
,
affectionate
pleading
,
such
as
he
may
have
use
to
a
venerated
elder
brother
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
's
eye
be
fix
on
him
with
a
listening
contemplation
,
and
he
be
silent
for
a
little
while
after
Deronda
have
cease
to
speak
.
<EOS>
then
he
say
,
with
an
almost
reproachful
emphasis
    
<EOS>
"
and
you
would
have
me
hold
it
doubtful
whether

together

the
leave
from

again

when

voice
they

Deronda
sit
perfectly
still

feel
his
face
tingle
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
either
to
deny
or
assent
.
<EOS>
He
wait
,
hope
that
Mordecai
would
presently
give
him
a
more
direct
answer
.
<EOS>
and
after
a
pause
of
meditation
he
do
say
,
firmly
    
"
what
you

I
will
do

He
pause
a
moment
,
and
then
add
in
a
more
melancholy
tone
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
shall
grieve
to
part
from
these
parent

the
little
one

unwavering
compliance

Mordecai

rise
with
the
air

have
to
perform
a
painful
duty

then
come
,
as
an
afterthought

when

parlor

eld
Mrs.

<EOS>
It
seem
part
of
Mordecai
's
eccentricity
that
he
should
call
this
gentleman
his
friend

and
the
two
woman
try
to
show
their
well
manner
by
warm
politeness

in

good

His

have
be
gather

incredulous
sorrow
at
the
notion
of
Mordecai
's
go
away
:
he
be
unable

imagine
the
change
as
anything

at
the
mention
of

hard

there
be
no

sensible
that

speech
,
address
Deronda
with
some
elevation
of
pitch
,
square
his
elbow
and
rest
a
hand
on
each
knee
:
    
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
as
we
be
the
people
to
grudge
anybody
's
good
luck
,
sir
,
or
the
portion
of
their
cup
be
make
full
,
as
I
may
say
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
an
envious
man
,
and
if
anybody
offer
to
set
up
Mordecai
in
a
shop
of
my
sort
two
door
low
down
,
_
I
_
should
not
make
wry
face
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
one
of
them
that
have
nee
have
a
poor
opinion
of
themselves
,
and
be
frighten
at
anybody
else
get
a
chance
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
offal
,
let
a
wise
man
come
and
tell
me
,
for
I
have
never
hear
it
yet
.
<EOS>
and
in
point
of
business
,
I
be
not
a
class
of
good
to
be
in
danger
.
<EOS>
if
anybody
take
to
roll
me
,
I
can
pack
myself
up
like
a
caterpillar
,
and
find
my
foot
when
I
be
let
alone
.
<EOS>
and
though
,
as
I
may
say
,
you
be
take
some
of
our
good
work
from
us
,
which
be
property
bearing
interest
<EOS>
,
I
be
not
say
<EOS>
but
we
can
afford
that
,
though
my
mother
and
my
wife
have
the
good
will
to
wish
and
do
for
Mordecai
to
the
last
;
and
a
Jew
must
not
be
like
a
servant
who
work
for
reward
 
though
I
see
nothing
against
a
reward
if
I
can
get
it
.
<EOS>
and
as
to
the
extra
outlay
in
schooling
,
I
be
neither
poor
nor
greedy
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
hang
myself
for
sixpence
,
nor
half
a
crown
neither
.
<EOS>
but
the
truth
of
it
be
,
the
woman
and
child
be
fond
of
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
You
may
partly
see
how
it
be
,
sir
,
by
your
own
sense
.
<EOS>
a
jewish
man
be
bind
to
thank
God
,
day
by
day
,
that
he
be
not
make
a
woman
;
but
a
woman
have
to
thank
God
that
He
have
make
her
accord
to
His
will
.
<EOS>
and
we
all
know
what
He
have
make
her
 
a
child
-
bearing
,
tender
-
hearted
thing
be
the
woman
of
our
people
.
<EOS>
Her
child
be
mostly
stout
,
as
I
think
you
will
say
Addy
's
be
,
and
she
be
not
mushy
,
but
her
heart
be
tender
.
<EOS>
so
you
must
excuse
present
company
,
sir
,
for
not
be
glad
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
and
as
to
this
young
lady
 
for
by
what
you
say
"
young
lady
"
be
the
proper
term
"
 
Cohen
here
throw
some
additional
emphasis
into
his
look
and
tone
 
<EOS>
"
we
shall
all
be
glad
for
Mordecai
's
sake
by
-
and
-
by
,
when
we
cast
up
our
account
and
see
where
we
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
before
Deronda
could
summon
any
answer
to
this
oddly
mixed
speech
,
Mordecai
exclaim
    
"
friend
,
friend
!
<EOS>
for
food
and
raiment
and
shelter
I
would
not
have
seek
better
than
you
have
give
me
.
<EOS>
You
have
sweeten
the
morsel
with
love
;
and
what
I
think
of
as
a
joy
that
would
be
leave
to
me
even
in
the
last
month
of
my
wane
strength
be
to
go
on
teach
the
lad
.
<EOS>
but
now
I
be
as
one
who
have
clothe
himself
beforehand
in
his
shroud
,
and
use
himself
to
make
the
grave
his
bed
,
when
the
divine
command
sound
in
his
ear
,
"
arise
,
and
go
forth
;
the
night
be
not
yet
come
.
<EOS>
"
for
no
light
matter
would
I
have
turn
away
from
your
kindness
to
take
another
's
.
<EOS>
but
it
have
be
teach
us
,
as
you
know
,
that
_
the
reward
of
one
duty
be
the
power
to
fulfill
another
_
 
<EOS>
so
say
Ben
Azai
.
<EOS>
You
have
make
your
duty
to
one
of
the
poor
among
your
brother
a
joy
to
you
and
me
;
and
your
reward
shall
be
that
you
will
not
rest
without
the
joy
of
like
deed
in
the
time
to
come
.
<EOS>
and
may
not
Jacob
come
and
visit
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
have
turn
with
this
question
to
Deronda
,
who
say
    
"
surely
that
can
be
manage
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
further
than
Brompton
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jacob
,
who
have
be
gradually
calm
by
the
need
to
hear
what
be
go
forward
,
begin
now
to
see
some
daylight
on
the
future
,
the
word
"
visit
"
have
the
lively
charm
of
cake
and
general
relaxation
at
his
grandfather
's
,
the
dealer
in
knife
.
<EOS>
He
dance
away
from
Mordecai
,
and
take
up
a
station
of
survey
in
the
middle
of
the
hearth
with
his
hand
in
his
knickerbocker
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
the
grandmother
,
with
a
sigh
of
resignation
,
"
<EOS>
I
hope
there
will
be
nothing
in
the
way
of
your
get
_
kosher
_
meat
,
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
for
you
will
have
to
trust
to
those
you
live
with
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
all
right
<EOS>
,
that
be
all
right
<EOS>
,
you
may
be
sure
,
mother
,
"
say
Cohen
,
as
if
anxious
to
cut
off
inquiry
on
matter
in
which
he
be
uncertain
of
the
guest
's
position
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
,
sir
,
"
he
add
,
turn
with
a
look
of
amused
enlightenment
to
Deronda
,
"
it
be
well
than
learn
you
have
to
talk
to
Mordecai
about
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
to
myself
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
I
think
somehow
there
be
a
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mordecai
will
perhaps
explain
to
you
how
it
be
that
I
be
seek
him
,
"
say
Deronda
,
feel
that
he
have
better
go
,
and
rise
as
he
speak
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
agree
that
he
should
come
again
and
the
final
move
be
make
on
the
next
day
but
one
;
but
when
he
be
go
Mordecai
beg
to
walk
with
him
to
the
end
of
the
street
,
and
wrap
himself
in
coat
and
comforter
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
March
evening
,
and
Deronda
do
not
mean
to
let
him
go
far
,
but
he
understand
the
wish
to
be
outside
the
house
with
him
in
communicative
silence
,
after
the
exciting
speech
that
have
be
fill
the
last
hour
.
<EOS>
no
word
be
speak
until
Deronda
have
propose
parting
,
when
he
say
    
"
Mirah
would
wish
to
thank
the
Cohens
for
their
goodness
.
<EOS>
You
would
wish
her
to
do
so
 
to
come
and
see
them
,
would
you
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
do
not
answer
immediately
,
but
at
length
say
    
"
I
can
not
tell
.
<EOS>
I
fear
not
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
family
sorrow
,
and
the
sight
of
my
sister
may
be
to
them
as
the
fresh
bleeding
of
wound
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
daughter
and
sister
who
will
never
be
restore
as
Mirah
be
.
<EOS>
but
who
know
the
pathway
?
<EOS>
We
be
all
of
us
deny
or
fulfil
prayer
 
and
man
in
their
careless
deed
walk
amidst
invisible
outstretched
arm
and
pleading
make
in
vain
.
<EOS>
in
my
ear
I
have
the
prayer
of
generation
past
and
to
come
.
<EOS>
My
life
be
as
nothing
to
me
but
the
beginning
of
fulfilment
.
<EOS>
and
yet
I
be
only
another
prayer
 
which
you
will
fulfil
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
press
his
hand
,
and
they
part
.
      
<EOS>
"
and
you
must
love
him
ere
to
you
  
<EOS>
He
will
seem
worthy
of
your
love
.
"
                          
<EOS>
WORDSWORTH
.
   
<EOS>
one
may
be
tempt
to
envy
Deronda
provide
new
clothe
for
Mordecai
,
and
please
himself
as
if
he
be
sketch
a
picture
in
imagine
the
effect
of
the
fine
gray
flannel
shirt
and
a
dressing
-
gown
very
much
like
a
Franciscan
's
brown
frock
,
with
Mordecai
's
head
and
neck
above
them
.
<EOS>
half
his
pleasure
be
the
sense
of
see
Mirah
's
brother
through
her
eye
,
and
secure
her
fervid
joy
from
any
perturbing
impression
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
after
he
have
make
all
thing
ready
,
he
be
visit
with
doubt
whether
he
be
not
mistake
her
,
and
put
the
low
effect
for
the
high
:
be
she
not
just
as
capable
as
he
himself
have
be
of
feel
the
impressive
distinction
in
her
brother
all
the
more
for
that
aspect
of
poverty
which
be
among
the
memorial
of
his
past
?
<EOS>
but
there
be
the
meyrick
to
be
propitiate
toward
this
too
Judaic
brother
;
and
Deronda
detect
himself
pique
into
get
out
of
sight
everything
that
may
feed
the
ready
repugnance
in
mind
unblessed
with
that
precious
"
seeing
,
"
that
bathe
of
all
object
in
a
solemnity
as
of
sun
-
set
glow
,
which
be
begotten
of
a
loving
reverential
emotion
.
  
<EOS>
and
his
inclination
would
have
be
the
more
confirm
if
he
have
hear
the
dialogue
round
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
fire
late
in
the
evening
,
after
Mirah
have
go
to
her
room
.
<EOS>

say
    
"
<EOS>

Mrs.

"
You

then
abruptly

bend
to

her

in

<EOS>
"
Suppose

know
how

Kate

<EOS>
but
her
answer
be
a
slam
of
the
door

<EOS>
"
I
_
<EOS>
should

like
to
see
Mirah
when
Mr.
Deronda
tell
her

,
"
she
go
on
to
her
mother

<EOS>
"
I
know
she
will
look
so
beautiful

"
  
<EOS>
but
Deronda
,
on
second
thought
,
have
write
a
letter
,
which
Mrs.
Meyrick
receive
the
next
morning
,
beg
her
to
make
the
revelation
instead
of
wait
for
him
,
not
give
the
real
reason
 
that
he
shrink
from
go
again
through
a
narrative
in
which
he
seem
to
be
make
himself
important
and
give
himself
a
character
of
general
beneficence
 
but
say
that
he
wish
to
remain
with
Mordecai
while
Mrs.
Meyrick
would
bring
Mirah
on
what
be
to
be
understand
as
a
visit
,
so
that
there
may
be
a
little
interval
before
that
change
of
abode
which
he
expect
that
Mirah
herself
would
propose
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
secretly
feel
some
wonder
anxiety
how
far
Mordecai
,
after
year
of
solitary
preoccupation
with
idea
likely
to
have
become
the
more
exclusive
from
continual
diminution
of
bodily
strength
,
would
allow
him
to
feel
a
tender
interest
in
his
sister
over
and
above
the
rendering
of
pious
duty
.
<EOS>
His
feeling
for
the
Cohens
,
and
especially
for
little
Jacob
,
show
a
persistent
activity
of
affection
;
but
these
object
have
enter
into
his
daily
life
for
year
;
and
Deronda
feel
it
noticeable
that
Mordecai
ask
no
new
question
about
Mirah
,
maintaining
,
indeed
,
an
unusual
silence
on
all
subject
,
and
appear
simply
to
submit
to
the
change
that
be
come
over
his
personal
life
.
<EOS>
He
don
the
new
clothe
obediently
,
but
say
afterward
to
Deronda
,
with
a
faint
smile
,
"
I
must
keep
my
old
garment
by
me
for
a
remembrance
.
"
<EOS>
and
when
they
be
seat
,
await
Mirah
,
he
utter
no
word
,
keep
his
eyelid
close
,
but
yet
show
restless
feeling
in
his
face
and
hand
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
Mordecai
be
undergo
that
peculiar
nervous
perturbation
only
know
to
those
whose
mind
,
long
and
habitually
move
with
strong
impetus
in
one
current
,
be
suddenly
compel
into
a
new
or
reopen
channel

<EOS>
susceptible
people
,
whose
strength
have
be
long
absorb
by
dormant
bias
,
dread
an
interview
that
imperiously
revive
the
past
,
as
they
would
dread
a
threatening
illness
.
<EOS>
joy
may
be
there
,
but
joy
,
too
,
be
terrible
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
feel
the
infection
of
excitement
,
and
when
he
hear
the
ring
at
the
door
,
he
go
out
,
not
know
exactly
why
,
that
he
may
see
and
greet
Mirah
beforehand
.
<EOS>
He
be
startled
to
find
that
she
have
on
the
hat
and
cloak
in
which
he
have
first
see
her
 
the
memorable
cloak
that
have
once
be
wet
for
a
winding

sheet
.
<EOS>
She
have
come
down

stair
equip
in
this
way
;
and
when
Mrs.
Meyrick
say
,
in
a
tone
of
question
,
"
You
like
to
go
in
that
dress
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
answer
,
"
My
brother
be
poor
,
and
I
want
to
look
as
much
like
him
as
I
can
,
else
he
may
feel
distant
from
me
"
 
imagine
that
she
should
meet
him
in
the
workman
's
dress
.
<EOS>
Deronda
could
not
make
any
remark
,
but
feel
secretly
rather
ashamed
of
his
own
fastidious
arrangement
.
<EOS>
They
shake
hand
silently
,
for
Mirah
look
pale
and
awed
.
  
<EOS>
when
Deronda
open
the
door
for
her
,
Mordecai
have
rise
,
and
have
his
eye
turn
toward
it
with
an
eager
gaze
.
<EOS>
Mirah
take
only
two
or
three
step
,
and
then
stand
still
.
<EOS>
They
look
at
each
other
,
motionless
.
<EOS>
It
be
less
their
own
presence
that
they
feel
than
another
<EOS>
be
;
they
be
meet
first
in
memory
,
compare
with
which
touch
be
no

<EOS>
Mirah
be
the
first
to
break
the
silence
,
stand
where
she
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ezra

"
she
say
,
in
exactly
the
same
tone
as
when
she
be
tell
of
her
mother
's
call
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
with
a
sudden
movement
advanced
and
lay
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
head
tall
,
and
look
down
at
her
tenderly
while
he
say
,
"
that

You
remember
her

<EOS>
yes

and
how
you
answer
her
 
"

<EOS>
and
I
know
you

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mirah
throw
her
arm
round
her
brother
's
neck
,
clasp
her
little
hand
behind
it
,
and
draw
down
his
face
,
kiss
it
with
childlike
lavishness
,
Her
hat
fall
backward
on
the
ground
and
disclose
all
her
curl

<EOS>
"
ah
,
the
dear
head
,
the
dear
head

"
say
Mordecai
,
in
a
low
loving
tone
,
lay
his
thin
hand
gently
on
the
curl
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
ill

Ezra

say
Mirah
,
sadly
look
at
him
with
more
observation

<EOS>
"
yes
,
dear
child
,
I
shall
not
be
long
with
you
in

be
the
quiet
answer

<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
will
love
you
and
we
will
talk
to
each
other

"
say
Mirah
,
with
a
sweet
outpouring
of
her
word
,
as
spontaneous
as
bird

note

<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
everything

<EOS>
Mirah
until
now
have
quite
forget
that
any
one
be
by
,
but
here
she
turn
with
the
pretty
attitude
,
keep
one
hand
on
her
brother
's
arm
while
she
look
at
Mrs.
Meyrick
and
Deronda

<EOS>
the
little
mother
's
happy
emotion
in

this
meeting

her
to
Mordecai

her
really

have
more
dignity

refinement

she
have
feel
oblige
to
believe
in
from
Deronda

account

<EOS>
"
see
this
dear
lady

"
say
Mirah
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
a
stranger
,
a
poor
wanderer

<EOS>
please

my

she
add
,
beseechingly
,
take
Mrs.

and
put
it
in
Mordecai

,
then
press
them
both
with
her

and
lift
them
to
her
lip

<EOS>
"
the
Eternal
Goodness
have
be

Mordecai

<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
"
I

say
Deronda
,
lay
a
gentle
pressure
on
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
arm
,
and
she
immediately
comply
.
<EOS>
He
be
afraid
of
any
reference
to
the
fact
about
himself
which
he
have
keep
back
from
Mordecai
,
and
he
feel
no
uneasiness
now
in
the
thought
of
the
brother
and
sister
be
alone
together
.
        
<EOS>
'
Tis
hard

ill

and
have

save
    
only
one

it

into
his
mind
that
when
his

die
,
    
his

would
quickly
follow

<EOS>
Grandcourt
's
importance
as
a
subject
of
this
realm
be
of
the
grandly
passive
kind
which
consist
in
the
inheritance
of
land
.
<EOS>
political
and
social
movement
touch
him
only
through
the
wire
of
his
rental
,
and
his
most
careful
biographer
need
not
have
read
up
on
Schleswig
-
Holstein
,
the
policy
of
Bismarck
,
trade
-
union
,
household
suffrage
,
or
even
the
last
commercial
panic
.
<EOS>
He
glance
over
the
good
newspaper
column
on
these
topic
,
and
his
view
on
them
can
hardly
be
say
to
have
want
breadth
,
since
he
embrace
all
Germans
,
all
commercial
man
,
and
all
voter
liable
to
use
the
wrong
kind
of
soap
,
under
the
general
epithet
of
"
brute
;
"
but
he
take
no
action
on
these
much
-
agitate
question
beyond
look
from
under
his
eyelid
at
any
man
who
mention
them
,
and
retain
a
silence
which
serve
to
shake
the
opinion
of
timid
thinker
.
  
<EOS>
but
Grandcourt
,
within
his
own
sphere
of
interest
,
show
some
of
the
quality
which
have
enter
into
triumphal
diplomacy
of
the
wild
continental
sort
.
  
<EOS>
no
movement
of
Gwendolen
in
relation
to
Deronda
escape
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
deny
that
he
be
jealous
;
because
jealousy
would
have
imply
some
doubt
of
his
own
power
to
hinder
what
he
have
determine
against
.
<EOS>
that
his
wife
should
have
more
inclination
to
another
man
's
society
than
to
his
own
would
not
pain
him
:
what
he
require
be
that
she
should
be
as
fully
aware
as
she
would
have
be
of
a
lock
hand
-
cuff
,
that
her
inclination
be
helpless
to
decide
anything
in
contradiction
with
his
resolve
.
<EOS>
however
much
of
vacillate
whim
there
may
have
be
in
his
entrance
on
matrimony
,
there
be
no
vacillating
in
his
interpretation
of
the
bond
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
repent
of
his
marriage
;
it
have
really
bring
more
of
aim
into
his
life
,
new
object
to
exert
his
will
upon
;
and
he
have
not
repent
of
his
choice
.
<EOS>
His
taste
be
fastidious
,
and
Gwendolen
satisfy
it
:
he
would
not
have
like
a
wife
who
have
not
receive
some
elevation
of
rank
from
him
;
nor
one
who
do
not
command
admiration
by
her
mien
and
beauty
;
nor
one
whose
nail
be
not
of
the
right
shape
;
nor
one
the
lobe
of
whose
ear
be
at
all
too
large
and
red
;
nor
one
who
,
even
if
her
nail
and
ear
be
right
,
be
at
the
same
time
a
ninny
,
unable
to
make
spirited
answer
.
<EOS>
these
requirement
may
not
seem
too
exact
to
refined
contemporary
whose
own
ability
to
fall
in
love
have
be
hold
in
suspense
for
lack
of
indispensable
detail
;
but
few
perhaps
may
follow
him
in
his
contentment
that
his
wife
should
be
in
a
temper
which
would
dispose
her
to
fly
out
if
she
dare
,
and
that
she
should
have
be
urge
into
marry
him
by
other
feeling
than
passionate
attachment
.
<EOS>
still
,
for
those
who
prefer
command
to
love
,
one
do
not
see
why
the
habit
of
mind
should
change
precisely
at
the
point
of
matrimony
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
do
not
feel
that
he
have
choose
the
wrong
wife
;
and
have
take
on
himself
the
part
of
husband
,
he
be
not
go
in
any
way
to
be
fool
,
or
allow
himself
to
be
see
in
a
light
that
could
be
regard
as
pitiable
.
<EOS>
this
be
his
state
of
mind
 
not
jealousy
;
still
,
his
behavior
in
some
respect
be
<EOS>
as
like
jealousy
as
yellow
be
to
yellow
,
which
color
we
know
may
be
the
effect
of
very
different
cause
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
come
up
to
town
earlier
than
usual
because
he
wish
to
be
on
the
spot
for
legal
consultation
as
to
the
arrangement
of
his
will
,
the
transference
of
mortgage
,
and
that
transaction
with
his
uncle
about
the
succession
to
Diplow
,
which
the
bait
of
ready
money
,
adroitly
dangle
without
importunity
,
have
finally
win
him
to
agree
upon
.
<EOS>
but
another
acceptable
accompaniment
of
his
being
in
town
be
the
presentation
of
himself
with
the
beautiful
bride
whom
he
have
choose
to
marry
in
spite
of
what
other
people
may
have
expect
of
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
Grandcourt
go
about
with
the
sense
that
he
do
not
care
a
languid
curse
for
any
one
's
admiration
:
but
this
state
of
not
-
care
,
just
as
much
as
desire
,
require
its
related
object
 
namely
,
a
world
of
admire
or
envying
spectator
:
for
if
you
be
fond
of
look
stonily
at
smile
person
 
<EOS>
the
person
must
be
and
they
must
smile
 
a
rudimentary
truth
which
be
surely
forget
by
those
who
complain
of
mankind
as
generally
contemptible
,
since
any
other
aspect
of
the
race
must
disappoint
the
voracity
of
their
contempt
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
,
in
town
for
the
first
time
with
his
wife
,
have
his
non
-
caring
abstinence
from
curse
enlarge
and
diversify
by
splendid
reception
,
by
conspicuous
ride
and
drive
,
by
presentation
of
himself
with
her
on
all
distinguished
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
wish
her
to
be
seek
after
;
he
like
that
"
fellow
"
should
be
eager
to
talk
with
her
and
escort
her
within
his
observation
;
there
be
even
a
kind
of
lofty
coquetry
on
her
part
that
he
would
not
have
object
to
.
<EOS>
but
what
he
do
not
like
be
her
way
in
relation
to
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
after
the
musical
party
at
Lady
Mallinger
's
,
when
Grandcourt
have
observe
the
dialogue
on
the
settee
as
keenly
as
Hans
have
do
,
it
be
characteristic
of
him
that
he
name
Deronda
for
invitation
along
with
the
Mallingers
,
tenaciously
avoid
the
possible
suggestion
to
anybody
concerned
that
Deronda
's
presence
or
absence
could
be
of
the
least
importance
to
him
;
and
he
make
no
direct
observation
to
Gwendolen
on
her
behavior
that
evening
,
lest
the
expression
of
his
disgust
should
be
a
little
too
strong
to
satisfy
his
own
pride
.
<EOS>
but
a
few
day
afterward
he
remark
,
without
be
careful
of

nothing
make

Gwendolen
make
the
expected
application
,
and
be
not
without
alarm
at
the
notion
of
be
a
gawky
.
<EOS>
for
she
,
too
,
with
her
melancholy
distaste
for
thing
,
prefer
that
her
distaste
should
include
admirer
.
<EOS>
but
the
sense
of
overhang
rebuke
only
intensify
the
strain
of
expectation
toward
any
meeting
with
Deronda
.
<EOS>
the
novelty
and
excitement
of
her
town
life
be
like
the
hurry
and
constant
change
of
foreign
travel
;
whatever
may
be
the
inward
despondency
,
there
be
a
programme
to
be
fulfil
,
not
without
gratification
to
many
-
sided
self
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
always
happen
with
a
deep
interest
,
the
comparatively
rare
occasion
on
which
she
could
exchange
any
word
with
Deronda
have
a
diffusive
effect
in
her
consciousness
,
magnify
their
communication
with
each
other
,
and
therefore
enlarge
the
place
she
imagine
it
to
have
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
how
could
Deronda
help
this
?
<EOS>
He
certainly
do
not
avoid
her
;
rather
he
wish
to
convince
her
by
every
delicate
indirect
<EOS>
mean
that
her
confidence
in
him
have
not
be
indiscreet
since
it
have
not
lower
his
respect
.
<EOS>
moreover
he
like
be
near
her
 
<EOS>
how
could
it
be
otherwise
?
<EOS>
She
be
something
more
than
a
problem
:
she
be
a
lovely
woman
,
for
the
turn
of
whose
mind
and
fate
he
have
a
care
which
,
however
futile
it
may
be
,
keep
solicit
him
as
a
responsibility
,
perhaps
all
the
more
that
,
when
he
dare
to
think
of
his
own
future
,
he
see
it
lie
far
away
from
this
splendid
sad
-
hearted
creature
,
who
,
because
he
have
once
be
impel
to
arrest
her
attention
momentarily
,
as
he
may
have
seize
her
arm
with
warning
to
hinder
her
from
step
where
there
be
danger
,
have
turn
to
him
with
a
beseech
persistent
need
.
  
<EOS>
one
instance
in
which
Grandcourt
stimulate
a
feeling
in
Gwendolen
that
he
would
have
like
to
suppress
without
seem
to
care
about
it
,
have
relation
to
Mirah
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
inclination
linger
over
the
project
of
the
singing
lesson
as
a
sort
of
obedience
to
Deronda
's
advice
,
but
day
follow
day
with
that
want
of
perceive
leisure
which
belong
to
life
where
there
be
no
work
to
mark
off
interval

and
the
continual
liability
to
Grandcourt
's
presence
and
surveillance
seem
to
flatten
every
effort
to
the
level
of
the
boredom
which
his

express
;
his
negative
mind
be
as
diffusive
as
fog

cling
to

spoil
all

<EOS>
but
one
morning
when
they
be
breakfast
,
Gwendolen
,
in
a
recurrent
fit
of
determination
to
exercise
the
old
spirit
,
say
,
dally
prettily
over
her

<EOS>
"
why

say
Grandcourt
,
languidly
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
?
"
echo
Gwendolen
,
play
at
sauciness
;
"
because
I
can
not
eat
_
pâté
de
foie

_
to
make
me
sleepy
,
and
I
can
not
smoke
,
and
I
can
not
go
to
the
club
to
make
me
like
to
come
away
again
 
<EOS>
I
want
a
variety
of

what
would
be
the
most
convenient
time
,
when
you
be
busy
with
your

people

for
me
to
have
lesson
from
that
little
Jewess

whose

get
all
the
rage

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
whenever
you
like
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
push
away
his
plate
,
and
lean
back
in
his
chair
while
he
look
at
her
with
his
most
lizard
-
like
expression
and
,
play
with
the
ear
of
the
tiny
spaniel
on
his
lap
<EOS>
(
Gwendolen
have
take
a
dislike
to
the
dog
because
they
fawn
on
him
)
.
  
<EOS>
then
he
say
,
languidly
,
"
I
do
not
see
why
a
lady
should
sing

amateur
make
fool
of

<EOS>
a

can
not
risk
herself
in

squall

"
  
<EOS>
"
I

me
a

Gwendolen
,
with
her
little
upward
movement
of
her
chin

she
turn
her
eye
away
from
his
,

lift
a

at

;

have
devour
her
mortification

her

the
Raymonds

about

and
Mr.
Deronda

who
be
a
musician
himself

a
first

rate
judge

say
there
be
no
singing
in
such
good
taste

hers

room

think
his
opinion

an
authority

<EOS>
She
mean
to
sle
a
small
stone
at
her
husband
in
that
way

<EOS>
"
It
be
very
indecent
of
Deronda

go
about
praise
that

Grandcourt
in
a
tone
of
indifference
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indecent

exclaim
Gwendolen
,
redden
and
look
at
him
again
,
overcome
by
startled
wonder
,
and
unable
to
reflect
on
the
probable
falsity
of
the
phrase
 
"
to
go
about
praise

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
and
especially
when
she
be
patronize
by
Lady
Mallinger
.
<EOS>
He
ought
to
hold
his
tongue
about
her
.
<EOS>
man
can
see
what
be
his
relation
to
her

"
  
<EOS>
"
man
who
judge
of
other
by
themselves
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
turn
white
after
her
redness
,
and
immediately
smitten
with
a
dread
of
her
own
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
.
<EOS>
and
a
woman
should
take
their
judgment
 
else
<EOS>
she
be
likely
to
run
her
head
into
the
wrong
place
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
conscious
of
use
pincher
on
that
white
creature
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
take
Deronda
for
a
saint
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
no
!
"
say
Gwendolen
,
summon
desperately
her
almost
miraculous
power
of
self
-
control
,
and
speak
in
a
high
hard
tone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
only
a
little
less
of
a
monster
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
rise
,
push
her
chair
away
without
hurry
,
and
walk
out
of
the
room
with
something
like
the
care
of
a
man
who
be
afraid
of
show
that
he
have
take
more
wine
than
usual
.
<EOS>
She
turn
the
key
inside
her
dressing
-
room
door
,
and
sit
down
for
some
time
look
pale
and
quiet
as
when
she
be
leave
the
breakfast
-
room
.
<EOS>
even
in
the
moment
after
read
the
poisonous
letter
she
have
hardly
have
more
cruel
sensation
than
now
;
for
emotion
be
at
the
acute
point
,
where
it
be
not
distinguishable
from
sensation
.
<EOS>
Deronda
unlike
what
she
have
believe
him
to
be
,
be
an
image
which
affect
her
as
a
hideous
apparition
would
have
do
,
quite
apart
from
the
way
in
which
it
be
produce
.
<EOS>
It
have
take
hold
of
her
as
pain
before
she
could
consider
whether
it
be
fiction
or
truth
;
and
further
to
hinder
her
power
of
resistance
come
the
sudden
perception
<EOS>
,
how
very
slight
be
the
ground
of
her
faith
in
Deronda
 
<EOS>
how
little
she
know
of
his
life
 
<EOS>
how
childish
she
have
be
in
her
confidence
.
<EOS>
His
rebuke
and
his
severity
to
her
begin
to
seem
odious
,
along
with
all
the
poetry
and
lofty
doctrine
in
the
world
,
whatever
it
may
be
;
and
the
grave
beauty
of
his
face
seem
the
most
unpleasant
mask
that
the
common
habit
of
man
could
put
on
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
go
on
in
her
with
the
rapidity
of
a
sick
dream
;
and
her
start
into
resistance
be
very
much
like
a
waking
.
<EOS>
suddenly
from
out
the
gray
sombre
morning
there
come
a
stream
of
sunshine
,
wrap
her
in
warmth
and
light
where
she
sit
in
stony
stillness
.
<EOS>
She
move
gently
and
look
round
<EOS>
her
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
world
outside
this
bad
dream
,
and
the
dream
prove
nothing
;
she
rise
,
stretch
her
arm
upward
and
clasp
her
hand
with
her
habitual
attitude
when
she
be
seek
relief
from
oppressive
feeling
,
and
walk
about
the
room
in
this
flood
of
sunbeam
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
true
!
<EOS>
what
do
it
matter
whether
_
<EOS>
he
_
believe
it
or
not
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
be
what
she
repeat
to
herself
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
her
faith
come
back
again
;
it
be
only
the
desperate
cry
of
faith
,
finding
suffocation
intolerable
.
<EOS>
and
how
could
she
go
on
through
the
day
in
this
state
?
<EOS>
with
one
of
her
impetuous
alternation
,
her
imagination
fly
to
wild
action
by
which
she
would
convince
herself
of
what
she
wish
:
she
would
go
to
Lady
Mallinger
and
question
her
about
Mirah
;
she
would
write
to
Deronda
and
upbraid
him
with
make
the
world
all
false
and
wicked
and
hopeless
to
her
 
to
him
<EOS>
she
dare
pour
out
all
the
bitter
indignation
of
her
heart
.
<EOS>
no
;
she
would
go
to
Mirah
.
<EOS>
this
last
form
take
by
her
need
be
more
definitely
practicable
,
and
quickly
become
imperious
.
<EOS>
no
matter
what
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
the
pretext
of
ask
Mirah
to
sing
at
her
party
on
the
fourth
.
<EOS>
what
be
she
go
to
say
beside
?
<EOS>
how
satisfy
?
<EOS>
She
do
not
foresee
 
<EOS>
she
could
not
wait
to
foresee
.
<EOS>
if
that
idea
which
be
madden
her
have
be
a
living
thing
,
she
would
have
want
to
throttle
it
without
wait
to
foresee
what
would
come
of
the
act
.
<EOS>
She
ring
her
bell
and
ask
if
Mr.
Grandcourt
be
go
out
:
find
that
he
be
,
she
order
the
carriage
,
and
begin
to
dress
for
the
drive
;
then
she
go
down
,
and
walk
about
the
large
drawing
-
room
like
an
imprison
dumb
creature
,
not
recognize
herself
in
the
glass
panel
,
not
note
any
object
around
her
in
the
paint
gild
prison
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
would
probably
find
out
where
she
have
be
,
and
punish
her
in
some
way
or
other
 
no
matter
 
<EOS>
she
could
neither
desire
nor
fear
anything
just
now
<EOS>
but
the
assurance
that
she
have
not
be
delude
herself
in
her
trust
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
provide
with
Mirah
's
address
.
<EOS>
soon
she
be
on
the
way
with
all
the
fine
equipage
necessary
to
carry
about
her
poor
uneasy
heart
,
depend
in
its
palpitation
on
some
answer
or
other
to
question
which
she
do
not
know
how
she
should
put
.
<EOS>
She
be
as
heedless
of
what
happen
before
she
find
that
Miss
Lapidoth
be
at
home
,
as
one
be
of
lobby
and
passage
on
the
way
to
a
court
of
justice
 
heedless
of
everything
till
she
be
in
a
room
where
there
be
fold
-
door
,
and
she
hear
Deronda
's
voice
behind
it
.
<EOS>
doubtless
the
identification
be
help
by
forecast
,
but
she
be
as
certain
of
it
as
if
she
have
see
him
.
<EOS>
She
be
frightened
at
her
own
agitation
,
and
begin
to
unbutton
her
glove
that
she
may
button
them
again
,
and
bite
her
lip
over
the
pretended
difficulty
,
while
the
door
open
,
and
Mirah
present
herself
with
perfect
quietude
and
a
sweet
smile
of
recognition
.
<EOS>
there
be
relief
in
the
sight
of
her
face
,
and
Gwendolen
be
able
to
smile
in
return
,
while
she
put
out
her
hand
in
silence
;
and
as
she
seat
herself
,
all
the
while
hear
the
voice
,
she
feel
some
reflux
of
energy
in
the
confused
sense
that
the
truth
could
not
be
anything
that
she
dread
.
<EOS>
Mirah
draw
her
chair
very
near
,
as
if
she
feel
that
the
sound
of
the
conversation
should
be
subdue
,
and
look
at
her
visitor
with
placid
expectation
,
while
Gwendolen
begin
in
a
low
tone
,
with
something
that
seem
like
bashfulness
    
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
wonder
to
see
me
 
<EOS>
perhaps
I
ought
to
have
write
 
<EOS>
but
I
wish
to
make
a
particular
request
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
to
see
you
instead
of
have
a
letter

"
say
Mirah
,
wonder
at
the
change
expression
and
manner
of
the
"
vandyke
duchess
,
"
as
Hans
have
teach
her
to
call
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
the
rich
color
and
the
calmness
of
her
own
face
be
in
strong
contrast
with
the
pale
agitated
beauty
under
the
plume
hat
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
Gwendolen
go
on
 
"
at
least
I
hope
,
you
would
not
object
to
sing
at
our
house
on
the
4th
 
in
the
evening
 
at
a
party
like
Lady
Brackenshaw
's
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
so
much
oblige

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
very
happy
to
sing
for
you

<EOS>
at
ten
?

say
Mirah
,
while
Gwendolen
seem
to
get
more
instead
of
less
embarrassed
.
  
<EOS>
"
at
ten
,
please
,
"
she
answer
;
then
pause
,
and
feel
that
she
have
nothing
more
to
say
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
go
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
rise
and
say
good
-
bye

<EOS>
Deronda
's
voice
be
in
her
ear
.
<EOS>
She
must
say
it
 
<EOS>
she
could
contrive
no
other
sentence
    
<EOS>
"
Mr.

in
the
next
room

former
tone

"
You

Gwendolen

who
have
hear
this
from

have
not
mind
it
then

yes

good

indifferently

You

You

any

<EOS>
Could
the

spirited

have
behave

like
a

but
the
strange
word
penetrate
Mirah
with
nothing

a
sense
of
solemnity

indignation

<EOS>
with
a
sudden
light
in

tremor
in

she

"
who
be
the
people
that
say
evil
of
him

<EOS>
I
would
not
believe
any
evil
of
him

if
an
angel
come
to
tell
it
me

<EOS>
He
find
me
when
I
be
so
miserable
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
drown
myself

I
look
so
poor
and
forsaken
;
you
would
have
think
I
be
a
beggar
by
the

he
treat
me
as
if

He
take
me
to
the

He

and
he
honor
my

he
too
be
poor
 
<EOS>
oh
,
almost
as
poor
as
he
could
be

<EOS>
and
my
brother
honor
him

<EOS>
that
be
no
light
thing
to

"
 
here
Mirah
's
tone
change
to
one
of
profound
emphasis
,
and
she
shake
her
head
backward
:
"
for
my
brother
be
very
learned
and
great
-
minded
.
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Deronda
say
there
be
few
man
equal
to
him

"
<EOS>
some
jewish
defiance
have
flame
into
her
indignant
gratitude
and
her
anger
could
not
help
include
Gwendolen
since
she
seem
to
have
doubt
Deronda
's
goodness
.
  
<EOS>
but
Gwendolen
be
like
one
parch
with
thirst
,
drink
the
fresh
water
that
spread
through
the
frame
as
a
sufficient
bliss
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
notice
that
Mirah
be
angry
with
her
;
she
be
not
distinctly
conscious
of
anything
but
of
the
penetrating
sense
that
Deronda
and
his
life
be
no
more
like
her
husband
's
conception
than
the
morning
in
the
horizon
<EOS>
be
like
the
morning
mix
with
street
gas
.
<EOS>
even
Mirah
's
word
sink
into
the
indefiniteness
of
her
relief

<EOS>
She
could
hardly
have
repeat
them
,
or
say
how
her
whole
state
of
feeling
be
change

<EOS>
She
press
Mirah
's
hand
,
and
say
,
"
thank
you
,
thank
you
,
"
in
a
hurried
whisper
,
then
rise
,
and
add
,
with
only
a
hazy
consciousness
,
"
I
must
go
,
I
shall
see
you
 
on
the

I

bow
herself
out
automatically
,
while
Mirah
,
open
the
door
for
her
,
wonder
at
what
seem
a
sudden
retreat
into
chill
loftiness
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
indeed
,
have
no
feeling
to
spare
in
any
effusiveness
toward
the
creature
who
have
bring
her
relief
.
<EOS>
the
passionate
need
of
contradiction
to
Grandcourt
's
estimate
of
Deronda
,
a
need
which
have
blunt
her
sensibility
to
everything
else
,
be
no
sooner
satisfied
than
she
want
to
be
go
.
<EOS>
She
begin
to
be
aware
that
she
be
out
of
place
,
and
to
dread
Deronda
's
see
her
.
<EOS>
and
once
in
the
carriage
again
,
she
have
the
vision
of
what
await
her
at
home
.
<EOS>
when
she
draw
up
before
the
door
in
Grosvenor
Square
,
her
husband
be
arrive
with
a
cigar
between
his
finger
.
<EOS>
He
throw
it
away
and
hand
her
out
,
accompany
her
up
-
stair
.
<EOS>
She
turn
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
lest
he
should
follow
her
farther
and
give
her
no
place
to
retreat
to
;
then
she
sit
down
with
a
weary
air
,
take
off
her
glove
,
rub
her
hand
over
her
forehead
,
and
make
his
presence
as
much
of
a
cipher
as
possible
.
<EOS>
but
he
sit
,
too
,
and
not
far
from
her
 
just
in
front
,
where
to
avoid
look
at
him
must
have
the
emphasis
of
effort
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
where
you
have
be
at
this
extraordinary
hour
?
"
say
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
;
I
have
be
to
Miss
Lapidoth
's
,
to
ask
her
to
come
and
sing
for
us

say
Gwendolen
,
lay
her
glove
on
the
little
table
beside
her
,
and
look
down
at
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
to
ask
her
about
her
relation
with
Deronda
?
"
say
Grandcourt
,
with
the
cold
possible
sneer
in
his
low
voice
which
in
poor
Gwendolen
's
ear
be
diabolical
.
  
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
since
their
marriage
she
flash
out
upon
him
without
inward
check
.
<EOS>
turn
her
eye
full
on
his
she
say
,
in
a
biting
tone
    
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
;
and
what
you
say
be
false
 
<EOS>
a
low
,
wicked
falsehood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
tell
you
so
 
do
she
?
"
return
Grandcourt
,
with
a
more
thoroughly
distil
sneer
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
be
mute
.
<EOS>
the
dare
anger
within
her
be
turn
into
the
rage
of
dumbness
.
<EOS>
what
reason
for
her
belief
could
she
give
?
<EOS>
all
the
reason
that
seem
so
strong
and
live
within
her
 
<EOS>
she
see
them
suffocate
and
shrivel
up
under
her
husband
's
breath
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
proof
to
give
,
but
her
own
impression
,
which
would
seem
to
him
her
own
folly
.
<EOS>
She
turn
her
head
quickly
away
from
him
and
look
angrily
toward
the
end
of
the
room
:
she
would
have
rise
,
but
he
be
in
her
way
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
see
his
advantage
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
of
no
consequence
so
far
as
her
singing
go
,
"
he
say
,
in
his
superficial
drawl
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
have
her
to
sing
,
if
you
like
.
"
<EOS>
then
,
after
a
pause
,
he
add
in
his
low
imperious
tone
,
"
but
you
will
please
to
observe
that
you
be
not
to
go
near
that
house
again
.
<EOS>
as
my
wife
,
you
must
take
my
word
about
what
be
proper
for
you
.
<EOS>
when
you
undertake
to
be
Mrs.
Grandcourt
,
you
undertake
not
to
make
a
fool
of
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
have
be
make
a
fool
of
yourself
this
morning
;
and
if
you
be
to
go
on
as
you
have
begin
,
you
may
soon
get
yourself
talk
of
at
the
club
in
a
way
you
would
not
like
.
<EOS>
what
do
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
_
know
about
the
world
?
<EOS>
You
have
marry
_
me
_
,
and
must
be
guide
by
my
opinion
.
"
  
<EOS>
every
slow
sentence
of
that
speech
have
a
terrific
mastery
in
it
for
Gwendolen
's
nature
.
<EOS>
if
the
low
tone
have
come
from
a
physician
tell
her
that
her
symptom
be
those
of
a
fatal
disease
,
and
prognosticate
its
course
,
she
could
not
have
be
more
helpless
against
the
argument
that
lie
in
it
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
permit
to
move
now
,
and
her
husband
never
again
make
any
reference
to
what
have
occur
this
morning
.
<EOS>
He
know
the
force
of
his
own
word
.
<EOS>
if
this
white
-
handed
man
with
the
perpendicular
profile
have
be
send
to
govern
a
difficult
colony
,
he
may
have
win
reputation
among
his
contemporary
.
<EOS>
He
have
certainly
ability
,
would
have
understand
that
it
be
safe
to
exterminate
than
to
cajole
superseded
proprietor
,
and
would
not
have
flinch
from
make
thing
safe
in
that
way
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
do
not
,
for
all
this
,
part
with
her
recover
faith
;
 
rather
,
she
keep
it
with
a
more
anxious
tenacity
,
as
a
Protestant
of
old
keep
his
bible
hide
or
a
Catholic
his
crucifix
,
accord
to
the
side
favor
by
the
civil
arm
;
and
it
be
characteristic
of
her
that
apart
from
the
impression
gain
concern
Deronda
in
that
visit
,
her
imagination
be
little
occupy
with
Mirah
or
the
eulogise
brother
.
<EOS>
the
one
result
establish
for
her
be
,
that
Deronda
have
act
simply
as
a
generous
benefactor
,
and
the
phrase
"
read
Hebrew
"
have
fleet
unimpressively
across
her
sense
of
hearing
,
as
a
stray
stork
may
have
make
its
peculiar
flight
across
her
landscape
without
rouse
any
surprised
reflection
on
its
natural
history
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
issue
of
that
visit
,
as
it
regard
her
husband
,
take
a
strongly
active
part
in
the
process
which
make
an
habitual
conflict
within
her
,
and
be
the
cause
of
some
external
change
perhaps
not
observe
by
any
one
except
Deronda
.
<EOS>
as
the
week
go
on
bring
occasional
transient
interview
with
her
,
he
think
that
he
perceive
in
her
an
intensifying
of
her
superficial
hardness
and
resolute
display
,
which
make
her
abrupt
betrayal
of
agitation
the
more
marked
and
disturbing
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
in
fact
,
she
be
undergo
a
sort
of
discipline
for
the
refractory
which
,
as
little
as
possible
like
conversion
,
bend
half
the
self
with
a
terrible
strain
,
and
exasperate
the
unwillingness
of
the
other
half
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
have
an
active
divination
rather
than
discernment
of
refractoriness
in
her
,
and
what
have
happen
about
Mirah
quicken
his
suspicion
that
there
be
an
increase
of
it
dependent
on
the
occasion
when
she
happen
to
see
Deronda
<EOS>
:
there
be
some
"
confound
nonsense
"
between
them
:
he
do
not
imagine
it
exactly
as
flirtation
,
and
his
imagination
in
other
branch
be
rather
restrict
;
but
it
be
nonsense
that
evidently
keep
up
a
kind
of
simmer
in
her
mind
 
<EOS>
an
inward
action
which
may
become
disagreeable
outward
.
<EOS>
husband
in
the
old
time
be
know
to
have
suffer
from
a
threatening
devoutness
in
their
wife
,
present
itself
first
indistinctly
as
oddity
,
and
end
in
that
mild
form
of
lunatic
asylum
,
a
nunnery
:
Grandcourt
have
a
vague
perception
of
threaten
mood
in
Gwendolen
which
the
unity
between
them
in
his
view
of
marriage
require
him
peremptorily
to
check
.
<EOS>
among
the
mean
he
choose
,
one
be
peculiar
,
and
be
less
ably
calculate
than
the
speech
we
have
just
hear
.
  
<EOS>
He
determine
that
she
should
know
the
main
purport
of
the
will
he
be
make
,
but
he
could
not
communicate
this
himself
,
because
it
involve
the
fact
of
his
relation
to
Mrs.
Glasher
and
her
child
;
and
that
there
should
be
any
overt
recognition
of
this
between
Gwendolen
and
himself
be
supremely
repugnant
to
him
.
<EOS>
like
all
proud
,
closely
-
wrap
nature
,
he
shrink
from
explicitness
and
detail
,
even
on
triviality
,
if
they
be
personal
:
a
valet
must
maintain
a
strict
reserve
with
him
on
the
subject
of
shoe
and
stocking
.
<EOS>
and
clash
be
intolerable
to
him
;
his
habitual
want
be
to
put
collision
out
of
the
question
by
the
quiet
massive
pressure
of
his
rule
.
<EOS>
but
he
wish
Gwendolen
to
know
that
before
he
make
her
an
offer
it
be
no
secret
to
him
that
she
be
aware
of
his
relation
with
Lydia
,
her
previous
knowledge
be
the
apology
for
bring
the
subject
before
her
now
.
<EOS>
some
man
in
his
place
may
have
think
of
write
what
he
want
her
to
know
,
in
the
form
of
a
letter
.
<EOS>
but
Grandcourt
hate
writing
:
even
write
a
note
be
a
bore
to
him
,
and
he
have
long
be
accustomed
to
have
all
his
writing
do
by
Lush
.
<EOS>
We
know
that
there
be
person
who
will
forego
their
own
obvious
interest
rather
than
do
anything
so
disagreeable
as
to
write
letter
;
and
it
be
not
probable
that
these
imperfect
utilitarian
would
rush
into
manuscript
and
syntax
on
a
difficult
subject
in
order
to
save
another
's
feeling
.
<EOS>
to
Grandcourt
it
do
not
even
occur
that
he
should
,
would
,
or
could
write
to
Gwendolen
the
information
in
question
;
and
the
only
medium
of
communication
he
could
use
be
Lush
,
who
,
to
his
mind
,
be
as
much
of
an
implement
as
pen
and
paper
.
<EOS>
but
here
too
Grandcourt
have
his
reserve
,
and
would
not
have
utter
a
word
likely
to
encourage
Lush
in
an
impudent
sympathy
with
any
suppose
grievance
in
a
marriage
which
have
be
discommende
by
him
.
<EOS>
who
that
have
a
confidant
escape
believe
too
little
in
his
penetration
,
and
too
much
in
his
discretion
?
<EOS>
Grandcourt
have
always
allow
Lush
to
know
his
external
affair
indiscriminately
 
irregularity
,
debt
,
want
of
ready
money
;
he
have
only
use
discrimination
about
what
he
would
allow
his
confidant
to
say
to
him
;
and
he
have
be
so
accustomed
to
this
human
tool
,
that
the
have
him
at
call
in
London
be
a
recovery
of
lost
ease
.
<EOS>
It
follow
that
Lush
know
all
the
provision
of
the
will
more
exactly
than
they
be
know
to
the
testator
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
do
not
doubt
that
Gwendolen
,
since
she
be
a
woman
who
could
put
two
and
two
together
,
know
or
suspect
Lush
to
be
the
contriver
of
her
interview
with
Lydia
,
and
that
this
be
the
reason
why
her
first
request
be
for
his
banishment
.
<EOS>
but
the
bent
of
a
woman
's
inference
on
mixed
subject
which
excite
mixed
passion
be
not
determine
by
her
capacity
for
simple
addition
;
and
here
Grandcourt
lack
the
only
organ
of
thinking
that
could
have
save
him
from
mistake
 
namely
,
some
experience
of
the
mixed
passion
concern
.
<EOS>
He
have
correctly
divine
one
-
half
of
Gwendolen
's
dread
 
all
that
relate
to
her
personal
pride
,
and
her
perception
that
his
will
must
conquer
her
;
but
the
remorseful
half
,
even
if
he
have
know
of
her
broken
promise
,
be
as
much
out
of
his
imagination
as
the
other
side
of
the
moon
.
<EOS>
what
he
believe
her
to
feel
about
Lydia
be
solely
a
tongue
-
tie
jealousy
,
and
what
he
believe
Lydia
to
have
write
with
the
jewel
be
the
fact
that
she
have
once
be
use
to
wear
them
,
with
other
amenity
such
as
he
impute
to
the
intercourse
with
jealous
woman
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
triumphant
certainty
that
he
could
aggravate
the
jealousy
and
yet
smite
it
with
a
more
absolute
dumbness
.
<EOS>
His
object
be
to
engage
all
his
wife
's
egoism
on
the
same
side
as
his
own
,
and
in
his
employment
of
Lush
he
do
not
intend
an
insult
to
her
:
she
ought
to
understand
that
he
be
the
only
possible
envoy
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
's
view
of
thing
be
considerably
fence
in
by
his
general
sense
,
that
what
suit
him
other
must
put
up
with

the

stupidity

<EOS>
mephistophele
throw
upon
real
life

and
oblige
to
manage
his
own
plot

would
inevitably
make
blunder

<EOS>
one
morning
he
go
to
Gwendolen
in
the
boudoir
beyond
the
back
drawing
-
room
,
hat
and
glove
in
hand
,
and
say
with
his
best
-
temper
,
most
persuasive
drawl
,
stand
before
her
and
look
down
on
her
as
she
sit
with
a
book
on
her
lap
    
<EOS>
"
a
 
Gwendolen
,
there
be
some
business
about
property
to
be
explain
.
<EOS>
I
have
tell
Lush
to
come
and
explain
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
He
know
all
about
these
thing
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
out
.
<EOS>
He
can
come
up
now
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
only
person
who
can
explain
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
will
not
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
that
I
do
mind
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
angrily
,
start
up
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
see
him
.
"
<EOS>
She
show
the
intention
to
dart
away
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
be
before
her
,
with
his
back
toward
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
prepared
for
her
anger
,
and
show
none
in
return
,
say
,
with
the
same
sort
of
remonstrant
tone
that
he
may
have
use
about
an
objection
to
dine
out
    
"
It
be
no
use
make
a
fuss
.
<EOS>
there
be
plenty
of
brute
in
the
world
that
one
have
to
talk
to
.
<EOS>
People
with
any
_
savoir
vivre
<EOS>
_
do
not
make
a
fuss
about
such
thing
.
<EOS>
some
business
must
be
do
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
expect
agreeable
people
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
if
I
employ
Lush
,
the
proper
thing
for
you
be
to
take
it
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
not
to
make
a
fuss
about
it
.
<EOS>
not
to
toss
your
head
and
bite
your
lip
about
people
of
that
sort
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
drawl
and
the
pause
with
which
this
speech
be
utter
give
time
for
crowd
reflection
in
Gwendolen
,
quell
her
resistance
.
<EOS>
what
be
there
to
be
tell
her
about
property
?
<EOS>
this
word
have
certain
dominant
association
for
her
,
first
with
her
mother
,
then
with
Mrs.
Glasher
and
her
child
.
<EOS>
what
would
be
the
use
if
she
refuse
to
see
Lush
?
<EOS>
Could
she
ask
Grandcourt
to
tell
her
himself
?
<EOS>
that
may
be
intolerable
,
even
if
he
consent
,
which
it
be
certain
he
would
not
,
if
he
have
make
up
his
mind
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
the
humiliation
of
stand
an
obvious
prisoner
,
with
her
husband
bar
the
door
,
be
not
to
be
bear
any
longer
,
and
she
turn
away
to
lean
against
a
cabinet
,
while
Grandcourt
again
move
toward
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
arrange
for
Lush
to
come
up
now
,
while
I
be
out
,
"
he
say
,
after
a
long
organ
stop
,
during
which
Gwendolen
make
no
sign
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
tell
him
he
may
come
?
"
  
<EOS>
yet
another
pause
before
she
could
say
"
yes
"
 
her
face
turn
obliquely
and
her
eye
cast
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
come
back
in
time
to
ride
,
if
you
like
to
get
ready
,
"
say
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
no
answer
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
in
a
desperate
rage
,
"
think
he
.
<EOS>
but
the
rage
be
silent
,
and
therefore
not
disagreeable
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
follow
that
he
turn
her
chin
and
kiss
her
,
while
she
still
keep
her
eyelid
down
,
and
she
do
not
move
them
until
he
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
she
to
do
?
<EOS>
search
where
she
would
in
her
consciousness
,
she
find
no
plea
to
justify
a
plaint
.
<EOS>
any
romantic
illusion
she
have
have
in
marry
this
man
have
turn
on
her
power
of
use
him
as
she
like
.
<EOS>
He
be
use
her
as
he
like
.
  
<EOS>
She
sit
await
the
announcement
of
Lush
as
a
sort
of
sear
operation
that
she
have
to
go
through
.
<EOS>
the
fact
that
gall
her
gather
a
burn
power
when
she
think
of
their
lying
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
a
part
of
that
new
gambling
,
in
which
the
losing
be
not
simply
a
_
minus
_
,
but
a
terrible
_
plus
_
that
have
never
enter
into
her
reckoning
.
  
<EOS>
Lush
be
neither
quite
pleased
nor
quite
displeased
with
his
task
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
have
say
to
him
by
way
of
conclusion
,
"
do
not
make
yourself
more
disagreeable
than
nature
oblige
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
depend
,
"
think
Lush
.
<EOS>
but
he
say
,
"
I
will
write
a
brief
abstract
for
Mrs.
Grandcourt
to
read
.
"
<EOS>
He
do
not
suggest
that
he
should
make
the
whole
communication
in
writing
,
which
be
a
proof
that
the
interview
do
not
wholly
displease
him
.
  
<EOS>
some
provision
be
be
make
for
himself
in
the
will
,
and
he
have
no
reason
to
be
in
a
bad
humor
,
even
if
a
bad
humor
have
be
common
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
perfectly
convince
that
he
have
penetrate
all
the
secret
of
the
situation
;
but
he
have
no
diabolical
delight
in
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
only
the
small
movement
of
gratified
self
-
love
resentment
in
discern
that
this
marriage
have
fulfil
his
own
foresight
in
not
be
as
satisfactory
as
the
supercilious
young
lady
have
expect
it
to
be
,
and
as
Grandcourt
wish
to
feign
that
it
be
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
persistent
spite
much
strong
than
what
give
the
seasoning
of
ordinary
scandal
to
those
who
repeat
it
and
exaggerate
it
by
their
conjecture
.
<EOS>
with
no
active
compassion
or
good
-
will
,
he
have
just
as
little
active
malevolence
,
be
chiefly
occupy
in
like
his
particular
pleasure
,
and
not
dislike
anything
<EOS>
but
what
hinder
those
pleasure
 
everything
else
rank
with
the
last
murder
and
the
last
_
opéra
bouffe
_
,
under
the
head
of
thing
to
talk
about
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
be
not
indifferent
to
the
prospect
of
be
treat
uncivilly
by
a
beautiful
woman
,
or
to
the
counter
-
balance
fact
that
his
present
commission
put
into
his
hand
an
official
power
of
humiliate
her
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
mean
to
use
it
needlessly
;
but
there
be
some
person
so
gifted
in
relation
to
us
that
their
"
how
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
seem
charge
with
offense
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
time
that
Mr.
Lush
be
announce
,
Gwendolen
have
brace
herself
to
a
bitter
resolve
that
he
should
not
witness
the
slight
betrayal
of
her
feeling
,
whatever
he
may
have
to
tell
.
<EOS>
She
invite
him
to
sit
down
with
stately
quietude
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
what
be
this
man
to
her
?
<EOS>
He
be
not
in
the
least
like
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Her
power
of
hate
a
coarse
,
familiar
-
mannered
man
,
with
clumsy
hand
,
be
now
relax
by
the
intensity
with
which
she
hate
his
contrast
.
  
<EOS>
He
hold
a
small
paper
fold
in
his
hand
while
he
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
need
hardly
say
that
I
should
not
have
present
myself
if
Mr.
Grandcourt
have
not
express
a
strong
wish
to
that
effect
 
as
no
doubt
he
have
mention
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
from
some
voice
that
speech
may
have
sound
entirely
reverential
,
and
even
timidly
apologetic
.
<EOS>
Lush
have
no
intention
to
the
contrary
,
but
to
Gwendolen
's
ear
his
word
have
as
much
insolence
in
them
as
his
prominent
eye
,
and
the
pronoun
"
<EOS>
you
"
be
too
familiar
.
<EOS>
He
ought
to
have
address
the
fold
-
screen
,
and
speak
of
her
as
Mrs.
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
She
give
the
small
sign
of
a
bow
,
and
Lush
go
on
,
with
a
little
awkwardness
,
get
entangle
in
what
be
elegantly
call
tautology
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
have
be
in
Mr.
Grandcourt
's
confidence
for
fifteen
year
or
more
 
since
he
be
a
youth
,
in
fact
 
of
course
give
me
a
peculiar
position
.
<EOS>
He
can
speak
to
me
of
affair
that
he
could
not
mention
to
any
one
else
;
and
,
in
fact
,
he
could
not
have
employ
any
one
else
in
this
affair

<EOS>
I
have
accept
the
task
out
of
friendship
for
him
.
<EOS>
which
be
my
apology
for
accept
the
task
 
if
you
would
have
prefer
some
one
else

<EOS>
He
pause
,
but
she
make
no
sign
,
and
Lush
,
to
give
himself
a
countenance
in
an
apology
which
meet
no
acceptance
,
open
the
fold
paper
,
and
look
at
it
vaguely
before
he
begin
to
speak
again
.
  
<EOS>

this
paper
contain
some
information
about
Mr.
Grandcourt
's
will

an
abstract
of
a
part
he
wish
you
to
know
 
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
cast
your
eye
over
it
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
something
I
have
to
say
by
way
of
introduction
 
which
I
hope
you
will
pardon
me
for
,
if
it
be
not
quite
agreeable

<EOS>
Lush
find
that
he
be
behave
well
than
he
have
expect
,
and
have
no
idea
<EOS>
how
insult
he
make
himself
with
his
"
not
quite
agreeable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
say
what
you
have
to
say
without
apologize

please
,

say
Gwendolen
,
with
the
air
she
may
have
bestow
on
a
dog
-
stealer
<EOS>
come
to
claim
a
reward
for
find
the
dog
he
have
steal

<EOS>
"
I
have
only
to
remind
you
of
something
that
occur
before
your
engagement
to
Mr.
Grandcourt
,
"
say
Lush
,
not
without
the
rise
of
some
willing
insolence
in
exchange
for
her
scorn
.
<EOS>
"
You
meet
a
lady
in
Cardell
Chase
,
if
you
remember
,
who
speak
to
you
of
her
position
with
regard
to
Mr.

She
have
child
with
her
 
one

very
fine
boy

<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
lip
be
almost
as
pale
as
her
cheek
;
her
passion
have
no
weapon
 
<EOS>

no
well
than
chip

<EOS>
this
man
's
speech
be
like
a
sharp
knife
-
edge
draw
across
her
skin
:
but
even
her
indignation
at
the
employment
of
Lush
be
get
merge
in
a
crowd
of
other
feeling
,
dim
and
alarming
as
a
crowd
of
ghost

Mr.
Grandcourt
be
aware
that
you
be
acquaint
with
this
unfortunate
affair
beforehand

he
think
it
only
right
that
his
position
and
intention
should
be
make
quite
clear
to
you

It
be
an
affair
of
property
and
prospect

if
there
be
any
objection
you
have
to
make
,
if
you
would
mention
it
to
me

it
be
a
subject

of
course
he
would
rather
not
speak
about
himself
 
if
you
will
be
good
enough
just
to
read
this
.
<EOS>
"
with
the
last
word
Lush
rise
and
present
the
paper
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
when
Gwendolen
resolve
that
she
would
betray
no
feeling
in
the
presence
of
this
man
,
she
have
not
prepare
herself
to
hear
that
her
husband
know
the
silent
consciousness
,
the
silently
accept
term
on
which
she
have
marry
him

She
dare
not
raise
her
hand
to
take
the
paper

least
it
should
visibly
tremble
.
<EOS>
for
a
moment
Lush
stand
hold
it
toward
her
,
and
she
feel
his
gaze
on
her
as
ignominy
,
before
she
could
say
even
with
low
-
toned
haughtiness

Lay
it
on
the
table

and
go
into
the
next
room

please
.

<EOS>
Lush
obeyed
,
think
as
he
take
an
easy
-
chair
in
the
back
drawing
-
room
,
"
My
lady
wince
considerably
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
know
what
would
be
the
charge
for
that
superfine
article
,
Henleigh
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
"
but
it
seem
to
him
that
a
penniless
girl
have
do
better
than
she
have
any
right
to
expect
,
and
that
she
have
be
uncommonly
know
for
her
year
and
opportunity
:
her
word
to
Lydia
mean
nothing
,
and
her
run
away
have
probably
be
part
of
her
adroitness
.
<EOS>
It
have
turn
out
a
master
-
stroke
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
Gwendolen
be
rally
her
nerve
to
the
reading
of
the
paper
.
<EOS>
She
must
read
it
.
<EOS>
Her
whole
be
 
pride
,
long
for
rebellion
,
<EOS>
dream
of
freedom
,
remorseful
conscience
,
dread
of
fresh
visitation
 
<EOS>
all
make
one
need
to
know
what
the
paper
contain
.
<EOS>
but
at
first
it
be
not
easy
to
take
in
the
meaning
of
the
word
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
succeed
,
she
find
that
in
the
case
of
there
be
no
son
as
issue
of
her
marriage
,
Grandcourt
have
make
the
small
Henleigh
his
heir
;
that
be
all
she
care
to
extract
from
the
paper
with
any
distinctness
.
<EOS>
the
other
statement
as
to
what
provision
would
be
make
for
her
in
the
same
case
<EOS>
,
she
hurry
over
,
get
only
a
confused
perception
of
thousand
and
Gadsmere
.
<EOS>
It
be
enough
.
<EOS>
She
could
dismiss
the
man
in
the
next
room
with
the
defiant
energy
which
have
revive
in
her
at
the
idea
that
this
question
of
property
and
inheritance
be
mean
as
a
finish
to
her
humiliation
and
her
thraldom
.
  
<EOS>
She
thrust
the
paper
between
the
leave
of
her
book
,
which
she
take
in
her
hand
,
and
walk
with
her
stately
air
into
the
next
room
,
where
Lush
immediately
arise
,
await
her
approach
.
<EOS>
when
she
be
four
yard
from
him
,
it
be
hardly
an
instant
that
she
pause
to
say
in
a
high
tone
,
while
she
sweep
him
with
her
eyelash
    
<EOS>
"
tell
Mr.
Grandcourt
that
his
arrangement
be
just
what
I
desire
"
 
pass
on
without
haste
,
and
leave
lush
time
to
mingle
some
admiration
of
her
graceful
back
with
that
half
-
amused
sense
of
her
spirit
and
impertinence
,
which
he
express
by
raise
his
eyebrow
and
just
thrust
his
tongue
between
his
tooth
.
<EOS>
He
really
do
not
want
her
to
be
bad
punish
,
and
he
be
glad
to
think
that
it
be
time
to
go
and
lunch
at
the
club
,
where
he
mean
to
have
a
lobster
salad
.
  
<EOS>
what
do
Gwendolen
look
forward
to
?
<EOS>
when
her
husband
return
he
find
her
equipped
in
her
riding
-
dress
,
ready
to
ride
out
with
him
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
again
go
to
be
hysterical
,
or
take
to
her
bed
and
say
she
be
ill
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
implicit
resolve
adjust
her
muscle
before
she
could
have
frame
it
in
word
,
as
she
walk
out
of
the
room
,
leave
Lush
behind
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
go
to
act
in
the
spirit
of
her
message
,
and
not
to
give
herself
time
to
reflect
.
<EOS>
She
ring
the
bell
for
her
maid
,
and
go
with
the
usual
care
through
her
change
of
toilet
.
<EOS>
doubtless
her
husband
have
mean
to
produce
a
great
effect
on
her
:
by
-
and
-
by
<EOS>
perhaps
she
would
let
him
see
an
effect
the
very
opposite
of
what
he
intend
;
but
at
present
all
that
she
could
show
be
a
defiant
satisfaction
in
what
have
be
presume
to
be
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
It
come
as
an
instinct
rather
than
a
thought
,
that
to
show
any
sign
which
could
be
interpret
as
jealousy
,
when
she
have
just
be
insultingly
remind
that
the
condition
be
what
she
have
accept
with
her
eye
open
,
would
be
the
bad
self
-
humiliation
.
<EOS>
She
say
to
herself
that
she
have
not
time
to
-
day
to
be
clear
about
her
future
action
;
all
she
could
be
clear
about
be
that
she
would
match
her
husband
in
ignore
any
ground
for
excitement
.
<EOS>
She
not
only
ride
,
but
go
out
with
him
to
dine
,
contribute
nothing
to
alter
their
mutual
manner
,
which
be
never
that
of
rapid
interchange
in
discourse
;
and
curiously
enough
she
reject
a
handkerchief
on
which
her
maid
have
by
mistake
put
the
wrong
scent
 
a
scent
that
Grandcourt
have
once
object
to
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
would
not
have
like
to
be
an
object
of
disgust
to
this
husband
whom
she
hate
:
she
like
all
disgust
to
be
on
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
defer
thought
in
this
way
be
something
like
try
to
talk
without
singe
in
her
own
ear
.
<EOS>
the
thought
that
be
bind
up
with
our
passion
be
as
penetrative
as
air
 
<EOS>
everything
be
porous
to
it
;
bow
,
smile
,
conversation
,
repartee
,
be
mere
honeycomb
where
such
thought
rush
freely
,
not
always
with
a
taste
of
honey
.
<EOS>
and
without
shut
herself
up
in
any
solitude
,
Gwendolen
seem
at
the
end
of
nine
or
ten
hour
to
have
go
through
a
labyrinth
of
reflection
,
in
which
already
the
same
succession
of
prospect
have
be
repeat
,
the
same
fallacious
outlet
reject
,
the
same
shrinking
from
the
necessity
of
every
course
.
<EOS>
already
she
be
undergo
some
hardening
effect
from
feel
that
she
be
under
eye
which
see
her
past
action
solely
in
the
light
of
her
low
motive
.
<EOS>
She
live
back
in
the
scene
of
her
courtship
,
with
the
new
bitter
consciousness
of
what
have
be
in
Grandcourt
's
mind
 
certain
now
,
with
her
present
experience
of
him
,
that
he
have
a
peculiar
triumph
in
conquer
her
dumb
repugnance
,
and
that
ever
since
their
marriage
he
have
have
a
cold
exultation
in
know
her
fancied
secret
.
<EOS>
Her
imagination
exaggerate
every
tyrannical
impulse
<EOS>
he
be
capable
of
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
insist
on
be
separate
from
him
"
 
<EOS>
be
her
first
dart
determination
;
then
,
"
I
will
leave
him
whether
he
consent
or
not
.
<EOS>
if
this
boy
become
his
heir
,
I
have
make
an
atonement
.
"
<EOS>
but
neither
in
darkness
nor
in
daylight
could
she
imagine
the
scene
which
must
carry
out
those
determination
with
the
courage
to
feel
them
endurable
.
<EOS>
how
could
she
run
away
to
her
own
family
 
carry
distress
among
them
,
and
render
herself
an
object
of
scandal
in
the
society
she
have
leave
behind
her
?
<EOS>
what
future
lie
before
her
as
Mrs.
Grandcourt
go
back
to
her
mother
,
who
would
be
make
destitute
again
by
the
rupture
of
the
marriage
for
which
one
chief
excuse
have
be
that
it
have
bring
that
mother
a
maintenance
?
<EOS>
She
have
lately
be
see
her
uncle
and
Anna
in
London
,
and
though
she
have
be
save
from
any
difficulty
about
invite
them
to
stay
in
Grosvenor
Square
by
their
wish
to
be
with
Rex
,
who
would
not
risk
a
meeting
with
her
,
the
transient
visit
she
have
have
from
them
help
now
in
give
strong
color
to
the
picture
of
what
it
would
be
for
her
to
take
refuge
in
her
own
family
.
<EOS>
what
could
she
say
to
justify
her
flight
?
<EOS>
Her
uncle
would
tell
her
to
go
back
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
would
cry
.
<EOS>
Her
aunt
and
Anna
would
look
at
her
with
wonder
alarm
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
would
have
power
to
compel
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
absolutely
nothing
that
she
could
allege
against
him
in
judicious
or
judicial
ear
.
<EOS>
and
to
"
insist
on
separation
!
<EOS>
"
that
be
an
easy
combination
of
word
;
but
consider
as
an
action
to
be
execute
against
Grandcourt
,
it
would
be
about
as
practicable
as
to
give
him
a
pliant
disposition
and
a
dread
of
other
people
's
unwillingness
.
<EOS>
how
be
she
to
begin
?
<EOS>
what
be
she
to
say
that
would
not
be
a
condemnation
of
herself
?
<EOS>
"
if
I
be
to
have
misery
anyhow
,
"
be
the
bitter
refrain
of
her
rebellious
dream
,
"
I
have
better
have
the
misery
that
I
can
keep
to
myself
.
"
<EOS>
moreover
,
her
capability
of
rectitude
tell
her
again
and
again
that
she
have
no
right
to
complain
of
her
contract
,
or
to
withdraw
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
and
always
among
the
image
that
drive
her
back
to
submission
<EOS>
be
Deronda
.
<EOS>
the
idea
of
herself
separate
from
her
husband
,
give
Deronda
a
changed
,
perturbing
,
painful
place
in
her
consciousness
:
instinctively
she
feel
that
the
separation
would
be
from
him
too
,
and
in
the
prospective
vision
of
herself
as
a
solitary
,
dubiously
-
regard
woman
,
she
feel
some
tingle
bashfulness
at
the
remembrance
of
her
behavior
towards
him
.
<EOS>
the
association
of
Deronda
with
a
dubious
position
for
herself
be
intolerable
.
<EOS>
and
what
would
he
say
if
he
know
everything
?
<EOS>
probably
that
she
ought
to
bear
what
she
have
bring
on
herself
,
unless
she
be
sure
that
she
could
make
herself
a
well
woman
by
take
any
other
course
.
<EOS>
and
what
sort
of
woman
be
she
to
be
 
solitary
,
sicken
of
life
,
<EOS>
look
at
with
a
suspicious
kind
of
pity
?
 
<EOS>
even
if
she
could
dream
of
success
in
get
that
dreary
freedom
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grandcourt
"
run
away
"
would
be
a
more
pitiable
creature
than
Gwendolen
Harleth
condemn
to
teach
the
bishop
's
daughter
,
and
to
be
inspect
by
Mrs.
Mompert
.
  
<EOS>
one
characteristic
trait
in
her
conduct
be
worth
mention
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
look
a
second
time
at
the
paper
Lush
have
give
her
;
and
before
ring
for
her
maid
<EOS>
she
lock
it
up
in
a
travel
-
desk
which
be
at
hand
,
proudly
resolve
against
curiosity
about
what
be
allot
to
herself
in
connection
with
Gadsmere
 
feel
herself
brand
in
the
mind
of
her
husband
and
his
confidant
with
the
meanness
that
would
accept
marriage
and
wealth
on
any
condition
,
however
dishonorable
and
humiliating
.
  
<EOS>
day
after
day
the
same
pattern
of
thinking
be
repeat
.
<EOS>
there
come
nothing
to
change
the
situation
 
<EOS>
no
new
element
in
the
sketch
 
only
a
recurrence
which
engrave
it
.
<EOS>
the
May
week
go
on
into
June
,
and
still
Mrs.
Grandcourt
be
outwardly
in
the
same
place
,
present
herself
as
she
be
expect
to
do
in
the
accustomed
scene
,
with
the
accustomed
grace
,
beauty
,
and
costume
;
from
church
at
one
end
of
the
week
,
through
all
the
scale
of
desirable
reception
,
to
opera
at
the
other
.
<EOS>
church
be
not
markedly
distinguish
in
her
mind
from
the
other
form
of
self
-
presentation
,
for
marriage
have
include
no
instruction
that
enable
her
to
connect
liturgy
and
sermon
with
any
large
order
of
the
world
than
that
of
unexplained
and
perhaps
inexplicable
social
fashion
.
<EOS>
while
a
laudable
zeal
be
labor
to
carry
the
light
of
spiritual
law
up
the
alley
where
law
be
chiefly
know
as
the
policeman
,
the
brilliant
Mrs.
Grandcourt
,
condescend
a
little
to
a
fashionable
rector
and
conscious
of
a
feminine
advantage
over
a
learn
dean
,
<EOS>
be
,
so
far
as
pastoral
care
and
religious
fellowship
be
concern
,
in
as
complete
a
solitude
as
a
man
in
a
lighthouse
.
  
<EOS>
Can
we
wonder
at
the
practical
submission
which
hide
her
constructive
rebellion
?
<EOS>
the
combination
be
common
enough
,
as
we
know
from
the
number
of
person
who
make
us
aware
of
it
in
their
own
case
by
a
clamorous
unwearied
statement
of
the
reason
against
their
submitting
to
a
situation
which
,
on
inquiry
,
we
discover
to
be
the
least
disagreeable
within
their
reach
.
<EOS>
poor
Gwendolen
have
both
too
much
and
too
little
mental
power
and
dignity
to
make
herself
exceptional
.
<EOS>
no
wonder
that
Deronda
now
mark
some
hardening
in
a
look
and
manner
which
be
school
daily
to
the
suppression
of
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
for
example
.
<EOS>
one
morning
,
ride
in
Rotten
Row
with
Grandcourt
by
her
side
,
she
see
stand
against
the
railing
at
the
turn
,
just
face
them
,
a
dark
-
eyed
lady
with
a
little
girl
and
a
blonde
boy
,
whom
she
at
once
recognize
as
the
being
in
all
the
world
the
most
painful
for
her
to
behold
.
<EOS>
She
and
Grandcourt
have
just
slacken
their
pace
to
a
walk
;
he
be
on
the
outer
side
be
the
nearer
to
the
unwelcome
vision
,
and
Gwendolen
have
not
presence
of
mind
to
do
anything
but
glance
away
from
the
dark
eye
that
meet
her
piercingly
toward
Grandcourt
,
who
wheel
past
the
group
with
an
unmoved
face
,
give
no
sign
of
recognition
.
  
<EOS>
immediately
she
feel
a
rise
rage
against
him
mingle
with
her
shame
for
herself
,
and
the
word
,
"
You
may
at
least
have
raise
your
hat
to
her
,
"
fly
impetuously
to
her
lip
 
but
do
not
pass
them
.
<EOS>
if
as
her
husband
,
in
her
company
,
he
choose
to
ignore
these
creature
whom
she
herself
have
exclude
from
the
place
she
be
fill
,
how
could
she
be
the
person
to
reproach
him
?
<EOS>
She
be
dumb
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
chance
,
but
<EOS>
her
own
design
,
that
have
bring
Mrs.
Glasher
there
with
her
boy
.
<EOS>
She
have
come
to
town
under
the
pretext
of
make
purchase
 
really
want
educational
apparatus
for
her
child
,
and
have
have
interview
with
Lush
in
which
she
have
not
refuse
to
soothe
her
uneasy
mind
by
represent
the
probability
as
all
on
the
side
of
her
ultimate
triumph
.
<EOS>
let
her
keep
quiet
,
and
she
may
live
to
see
the
marriage
dissolve
itself
in
one
way
or
other
 
Lush
hint
at
several
way
 
leave
the
succession
assure
to
her
boy
.
<EOS>
She
have
have
an
interview
with
Grandcourt
,
too
,
who
have
as
usual
tell
her
to
behave
like
a
reasonable
woman
,
and
threaten
punishment
if
she
be
troublesome
;
but
have
,
also
as
usual
,
vindicate
himself
from
any
wish
to
be
stingy
,
the
money
he
be
receive
from
Sir
Hugo
on
account
of
Diplow
encourage
him
to
be
lavish
.
<EOS>
Lydia
,
feed
on
the
probability
in
her
favor
,
devour
her
helpless
wrath
along
with
that
pleasanter
nourishment
;
but
she
could
not
let
her
discretion
go
entirely
without
the
reward
of
make
a
Medusa
-
apparition
before
Gwendolen
,
vindictiveness
and
jealousy
finding
relief
in
an
outlet
of
venom
,
though
it
be
as
futile
as
that
of
a
viper
already
fling
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
.
<EOS>
hence
,
each
day
,
after
find
out
from
Lush
the
likely
time
for
Gwendolen
to
be
ride
,
she
have
watch
at
that
post
,
dare
Grandcourt
so
far
.
<EOS>
why
should
she
not
take
little
Henleigh
into
the
Park
?
  
<EOS>
the
Medusa
-
apparition
be
make
effective
beyond
Lydia
's
conception
by
the
shock
it
give
Gwendolen
actually
to
see
Grandcourt
ignore
this
woman
who
have
once
be
the
near
in
the
world
to
him
,
along
with
the
child
she
have
bear
him
.
<EOS>
and
all
the
while
the
dark
shadow
thus
cast
on
the
lot
of
a
woman
destitute
of
acknowledge
social
dignity
,
spread
itself
over
her
vision
of
a
future
that
may
be
her
own
,
and
make
part
of
her
dread
on
her
own
behalf
.
<EOS>
She
shrink
all
the
more
from
any
lonely
action
.
<EOS>
what
possible
release
could
there
be
for
her
from
this
hate
vantage
ground
,
which
yet
she
dare
not
quit
,
any
more
than
if
fire
have
be
rain
outside
it
?
<EOS>
what
release
,
but
death
?
<EOS>
not
her
own
death
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
be
not
a
woman
who
could
easily
think
of
her
own
death
as
a
near
reality
,
or
front
for
herself
the
dark
entrance
on
the
untried
and
invisible
.
<EOS>
It
seem
more
possible
that
Grandcourt
should
die
:
 
and
yet
not
likely
.
<EOS>
the
power
of
tyranny
in
him
seem
a
power
of
live
in
the
presence
of
any
wish
that
he
should
die
.
<EOS>
the
thought
that
his
death
be
the
only
possible
deliverance
for
her
be
one
with
the
thought
that
deliverance
would
never
come
 
the
double
deliverance
from
the
injury
with
which
other
being
may
reproach
her
and
from
the
yoke
she
have
bring
on
her
own
neck
.
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
she
foresee
him
always
live
,
and
her
own
life
dominate
by
him
;
the
"
always
"
of
her
young
experience
not
stretch
beyond
the
few
immediate
year
that
seem
immeasurably
long
with
her
passionate
weariness
.
<EOS>
the
thought
of
his
die
would
not
subsist
:
it
turn
as
with
a
dream
-
change
into
the
terror
that
she
should
die
with
his
throttle
finger
on
her
neck
avenging
that
thought
.
<EOS>
fantasy
move
within
her
like
ghost
,
make
no
break
in
her
more
acknowledge
consciousness
and
find
no
obstruction
in
it
:
dark
ray
do
their
work
invisibly
in
the
broad
light
.
  
<EOS>
only
an
evening
or
two
after
that
encounter
in
the
Park
,
there
be
a
grand
concert
at
Klesmer
's
,
who
be
live
rather
magnificently
now
in
one
of
the
large
house
in
Grosvenor
Place
,
a
patron
and
prince
among
musical
professor
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
have
look
forward
to
this
occasion
as
one
on
which
she
be
sure
to
meet
Deronda
,
and
she
have
be
meditate
how
to
put
a
question
to
him
which
,
without
contain
a
word
that
she
would
feel
a
dislike
to
utter
,
would
yet
be
explicit
enough
for
him
to
understand
it
.
<EOS>
the
struggle
of
opposite
feeling
would
not
let
her
abide
by
her
instinct
that
the
very
idea
of
Deronda
's
relation
to
her
be
a
discouragement
to
any
desperate
step
towards
freedom
.
<EOS>
the
next
wave
of
emotion
be
a
longing
for
some
word
of
his
to
enforce
a
resolve
.
<EOS>
the
fact
that
her
opportunity
of
conversation
with
him
have
always
to
be
snatch
in
the
doubtful
privacy
of
large
party
,
cause
her
to
live
through
them
many
time
beforehand
,
imagine
how
they
would
take
place
and
what
she
would
say
.
<EOS>
the
irritation
be
proportionate
when
no
opportunity
come
;
and
this
evening
at
Klesmer
's
she
include
Deronda
in
her
anger
,
because
he
look
as
calm
as
possible
at
a
distance
from
her
,
while
she
be
in
danger
of
betray
her
impatience
to
every
one
who
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
find
her
only
safety
in
a
chill
haughtiness
which
make
Mr.
Vandernoodt
remark
that
Mrs.
Grandcourt
be
become
a
perfect
match
for
her
husband
.
<EOS>
when
at
last
the
chance
of
the
evening
bring
Deronda
near
her
,
Sir
Hugo
and
Mrs.
Raymond
be
close
by
and
could
hear
every
word
she
say
.
<EOS>
no
matter
:
her
husband
be
not
near
,
and
her
irritation
pass
without
check
into
a
fit
of
daring
which
restore
the
security
of
her
self
-
possession
.
<EOS>
Deronda
be
there
at
last
,
and
she
would
compel
him
to
do
what
she
please
.
<EOS>
already
and
without
effort
rather
queenly
in
her
air
as
she
stand
in
her
white
lace
and
green
leave
she
throw
a
royal
permissiveness
into
her
way
of
say
,
"
I
wish
you
would
come
and
see
me
to
-
morrow
between
five
and
six
,
Mr.
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
could
be
but
one
answer
at
that
moment
:
"
certainly
,
"
with
a
tone
of
obedience
.
  
<EOS>
afterward
it
occur
to
Deronda
that
he
would
write
a
note
to
excuse
himself
.
<EOS>
He
have
always
avoid
make
a
call
at
Grandcourt
's
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
persuade
himself
to
any
step
that
may
hurt
her
,
and
whether
his
excuse
be
take
for
indifference
or
for
the
affectation
of
indifference
it
would
be
equally
wound
.
<EOS>
He
keep
his
promise
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
have
decline
to
ride
out
on
the
plea
of
not
feel
well
enough
have
leave
her
refusal
to
the
last
moment
when
the
horse
be
soon
to
be
at
the
door
 
not
without
alarm
lest
her
husband
should
say
that
he
too
would
stay
at
home
.
<EOS>
become
almost
superstitious
about
his
power
of
suspicious
divination
,
she
have
a
glance
forethought
of
what
she
would
do
in
that
case
 
namely
,
have
herself
deny
as
not
well
.
<EOS>
but
Grandcourt
accept
her
excuse
without
remark
,
and
ride
off
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
when
Gwendolen
find
herself
alone
,
and
have
send
down
the
order
that
only
Mr.
Deronda
be
to
be
admit
,
she
begin
to
be
alarm
at
what
she
have
do
,
and
to
feel
a
grow
agitation
in
the
thought
that
he
would
soon
appear
,
and
she
should
soon
be
oblige
to
speak
:
not
of
triviality
,
as
if
she
have
no
serious
motive
in
ask
him
to
come
:
and
yet
what
she
have
be
for
hour
determine
to
say
begin
to
seem
impossible
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
the
impulse
of
appeal
to
him
be
be
check
by
timidity
,
and
now
that
it
be
too
late
she
be
shake
by
the
possibility
that
he
may
think
her
invitation
unbecoming
.
<EOS>
if
so
,
she
would
have
sink
in
his
esteem
.
<EOS>
but
immediately
she
resist
this
intolerable
fear
as
an
infection
from
her
husband
's
way
of
thinking
.
<EOS>
that
_
he
_
would
say
she
be
make
a
fool
of
herself
be
rather
a
reason
why
such
a
judgment
would
be
remote
from
Deronda
's
mind
.
<EOS>
but
that
she
could
not
rid
herself
from
this
sudden
invasion
of
womanly
reticence
<EOS>
be
manifest
in
a
kind
of
action
which
have
never
occur
to
her
before
.
<EOS>
in
her
struggle
between
agitation
and
the
effort
to
suppress
it
,
she
be
walk
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
two
drawing
-
room
,
where
at
one
end
a
long
mirror
reflect
her
in
her
black
dress
,
choose
in
the
early
morning
with
a
half
-
admit
reference
to
this
hour
.
<EOS>
but
above
this
black
dress
her
head
on
its
white
pillar
of
a
neck
show
to
advantage
.
<EOS>
some
consciousness
of
this
make
her
turn
hastily
and
hurry
to
the
boudoir
,
where
again
there
be
a
glass
,
but
also
,
toss
over
a
chair
,
<EOS>
a
large
piece
of
black
lace
which
she
snatch
and
tie
over
her
crown
of
hair
so
as
completely
to
conceal
her
neck
,
and
leave
only
her
face
look
out
from
the
black
frame
.
<EOS>
in
this
manifest
contempt
of
appearance
,
she
think
it
possible
to
be
free
from
nervousness
,
but
the
black
lace
do
not
take
away
the
uneasiness
from
her
eye
and
lip
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
room
when
Deronda
be
announce
,
and
as
he
approach
her
<EOS>
she
perceive
that
he
too
for
some
reason
<EOS>
be
not
his
usual
self
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
have
define
the
change
except
by
say
that
he
look
less
happy
than
usual
,
and
appear
to
be
under
some
effort
in
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
and
yet
the
speaking
be
the
slight
possible
.
<EOS>
They
both
say
,
"
how
do
you
do
?
"
quite
curtly
;
and
Gwendolen
,
instead
of
sit
down
,
move
to
a
little
distance
,
rest
her
arm
slightly
on
the
tall
back
of
a
chair
,
while
Deronda
stand
where
he
be
,
 
both
feel
it
difficult
to
say
any
more
,
though
the
preoccupation
in
his
mind
could
hardly
have
be
more
remote
than
it
be
from
Gwendolen
's
conception
.
<EOS>
She
naturally
see
in
his
embarrassment
some
reflection
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
force
to
speak
,
she
find
all
her
training
in
concealment
and
self
-
command
of
no
use
to
her
and
begin
with
timid
awkwardness
    
<EOS>
"
You
will
wonder
why
I
beg
you
to
come
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
ask
you
something
.
<EOS>
You
say
I
be
ignorant
.
<EOS>
that
be
true
.
<EOS>
and
what
can
I
do
but
ask
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
and
at
this
moment
she
be
feel
it
utterly
impossible
to
put
the
question
she
have
intend
.
<EOS>
something
new
in
her
nervous
manner
rouse
Deronda
's
anxiety
lest
there
may
be
a
new
crisis
.
<EOS>
He
say
with
the
sadness
of
affection
in
his
voice
    
<EOS>
"
My
only
regret
be
,
that
I
can
be
of
so
little
use
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
the
word
and
the
tone
touch
a
new
spring
in
her
,
and
she
go
on
with
more
sense
of
freedom
,
yet
still
not
say
anything
she
have
design
to
say
,
and
begin
to
hurry
,
that
she
may
somehow
arrive
at
the
right
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
tell
you
that
I
have
always
be
think
of
your
advice
,
but
be
it
any
use
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
make
myself
different
,
because
thing
about
me
raise
bad
feeling
 
<EOS>
and
I
must
go
on
 
<EOS>
I
can
alter
nothing
 
<EOS>
it
be
no
use
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
pause
an
instant
,
with
the
consciousness
that
she
be
not
find
the
right
word
,
but
begin
again
hurriedly
,
"
<EOS>
but
if
I
go
on
I
shall
get
bad
.
<EOS>
I
want
not
to
get
bad
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
be
what
you
wish
.
<EOS>
there
be
people
who
be
good
and
enjoy
great
thing
 
<EOS>
I
know
there
be
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
contemptible
creature
.
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
I
should
get
wicked
with
hate
people
.
<EOS>
I
have
try
to
think
that
I
would
go
away
from
everybody
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
.
<EOS>
there
be
so
many
thing
to
hinder
me
.
<EOS>
You
think
,
perhaps
,
that
I
do
not
mind
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
mind
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
of
everything
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
of
get
wicked
.
<EOS>
tell
me
what
I
can
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
have
forget
everything
but
<EOS>
that
image
of
her
helpless
misery
which
she
be
try
to
make
present
to
Deronda
in
break
allusive
speech
 
wish
to
convey
but
not
express
all
her
need
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
be
tearless
,
and
have
a
look
of
smart
in
their
dilate
brilliancy
;
there
be
a
subdued
sob
in
her
voice
which
be
more
and
more
veiled
,
till
it
be
hardly
above
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
She
be
hurt
herself
with
the
jewel
that
glitter
on
her
tightly
-
clasp
finger
press
against
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
the
feel
Deronda
endure
in
these
moment
he
afterward
call
horrible
.
<EOS>
word
seem
to
have
no
more
rescue
in
them
than
if
he
have
be
behold
a
vessel
in
peril
of
wreck
 
<EOS>
the
poor
ship
with
its
many
-
live
anguish
beat
by
the
inescapable
storm
.
<EOS>
how
could
he
grasp
the
long
-
grow
process
of
this
young
creature
's
wretchedness
?
 
<EOS>
how
arrest
and
change
it
with
a
sentence
?
<EOS>
He
be
afraid
of
his
own
voice
.
<EOS>
the
word
that
rush
into
his
mind
seem
in
their
feebleness
nothing
well
than
despair
make
audible
,
or
than
that
insensibility
to
another
's
hardship
which
apply
precept
to
soothe
pain
.
<EOS>
He
feel
himself
hold
a
crowd
of
word
imprison
within
his
lip
,
as
if
the
let
them
escape
would
be
a
violation
of
awe
before
the
mystery
of
our
human
lot
.
<EOS>
the
thought
that
urge
itself
foremost
be
 
"
confess
everything
to
your
husband
;
have
nothing
conceal
:
"
 
the
word
carry
in
his
mind
a
vision
of
reason
which
would
have
need
much
full
expression
for
Gwendolen
to
apprehend
them
,
<EOS>
but
before
he
have
begin
those
brief
sentence
,
the
door
open
and
the
husband
enter
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
have
deliberately
go
out
and
turn
back
to
satisfy
a
suspicion
.
<EOS>
what
he
see
be
Gwendolen
's
face
of
anguish
frame
black
like
a
nun
's
,
and
Deronda
stand
three
yard
from
her
with
a
look
of
sorrow
such
as
he
may
have
bent
on
the
last
struggle
of
life
in
a
beloved
object
.
<EOS>
without
any
show
of
surprise
Grandcourt
nod
to
Deronda
,
give
a
second
look
at
Gwendolen
,
pass
on
,
and
seat
himself
easily
at
a
little
distance
cross
his
leg
,
take
out
his
handkerchief
and
trifle
with
it
elegantly
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
have
shrink
and
change
her
attitude
on
see
him
,
but
she
do
not
turn
or
move
from
her
place
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
moment
in
which
she
could
feign
anything
,
or
manifest
any
strong
revulsion
of
feeling
:
the
passionate
movement
of
her
last
speech
be
still
too
strong
within
her
.
<EOS>
what
she
feel
beside
be
a
dull
despairing
sense
that
her
interview
with
Deronda
be
at
an
end
:
a
curtain
have
fall
.
<EOS>
but
he
,
naturally
,
be
urge
into
self
-
possession
and
effort
by
susceptibility
to
what
may
follow
for
her
from
be
see
by
her
husband
in
this
betrayal
of
agitation
;
and
feeling
that
any
pretence
of
ease
in
prolong
his
visit
would
only
exaggerate
Grandcourt
's
possible
conjecture
of
duplicity
<EOS>
,
he
merely
say
    
"
I
will
not
stay
longer
now
.
<EOS>
good
bye
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
put
out
his
hand
,
and
she
let
him
press
her
poor
little
chill
finger
;
but
she
say
no
good
-
bye
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
have
leave
the
room
,
Gwendolen
throw
herself
into
a
seat
,
with
an
expectation
as
dull
as
her
despair
 
<EOS>
the
expectation
that
she
be
go
to
be
punish
.
<EOS>
but
Grandcourt
take
no
notice
:
he
be
satisfied
to
have
let
her
know
that
she
have
not
deceive
him
,
and
to
keep
a
silence
which
be
formidable
with
omniscience
.
<EOS>
He
go
out
that
evening
,
and
her
plea
of
feel
ill
be
accept
without
even
a
sneer
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
he
say
,
"
I
be
go
yacht
to
the
Mediterranean
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
when
?
"
say
Gwendolen
,
with
a
leap
of
heart
which
have
hope
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
the
yacht
be
at
Marseilles
.
<EOS>
Lush
be
go
to
get
everything
ready
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
have
mamma
to
stay
with
me
,
then
?
"
say
Gwendolen
,
the
new
sudden
possibility
of
peace
and
affection
fill
her
mind
like
a
burst
of
morning
light
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
you
will
go
with
me
.
"
            
<EOS>
ever
in
his
soul
  
<EOS>
that
large
justice
which
make
gratitude
  
triumph
above
resentment
.
'
<EOS>
tis
<EOS>
the
mark
  
of
regal
nature
,
with
the
wide
life
.
  
<EOS>
and
full
capability
of
joy
:
    
not
wit
exultant
in
the
strong
lens
  
<EOS>
to
show
you
goodness
vanish
into
pulp
  
<EOS>
never
worth
"
thank
you
"
 
<EOS>
they
be
the
devil
's
friar
,
  
vow
to
be
poor
as
he
in
love
and
trust
,
  
<EOS>
yet
must
go
begging
of
a
world
that
keep
  
some
human
property
.
   
<EOS>
Deronda
,
in
parting
from
Gwendolen
,
have
abstain
from
say
,
"
I
shall
not
see
you
again
for
a
long
while
:
I
be
go
away
,
"
lest
Grandcourt
should
understand
him
to
imply
that
the
fact
be
of
importance
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
actually
go
away
under
circumstance
so
momentous
to
himself
that
when
he
set
out
to
fulfill
his
promise
of
call
on
her
,
he
be
already
under
the
shadow
of
a
solemn
emotion
which
revive
the
deep
experience
of
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
have
send
for
him
to
his
chamber
with
the
note
 
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
something

a
preparation
that

him
some
relief
when

the
baronet

study

he
be

with
grave
affection
instead
of
the
distress
which
he
have
apprehend
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
nothing
to
grieve
you
,
sir
?
"
say
Deronda
,
in
a
tone
rather
of
restore
confidence
than
question
,
as
he
take
the
hand
hold
out
to
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
unusual
meaning
in
Sir
Hugo
's
look
,
and
a
subdued
emotion
in
his
voice
,
as
he
say

It
be
extremely
rare
for

much
serious
feeling

not

at

much

I
hardly

that

just
this
 
would
ever
happen

there
have
be
reason
why
I

never

I

strive
in

not

make
that
an
injury
to
you

"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
pause
,
but
Deronda
could
not
speak
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
say
,
"
I
have
never
feel
it
an
injury
.
"
even
if
that
have
be
true
,
he
could
not
have
trust
his
voice
to
say
anything
.
<EOS>
far
more
than
any
one
but
himself
could
know
of
be
hang
on
this
moment
when
the
secrecy
be
to
be
break
.
<EOS>
Sir

have
never
see
the
grand
face
he
delight
in
so
pale
 
<EOS>
the
lip
press
together
with
such
a
look
of
pain
.
<EOS>
He
go
on
with
a
more
anxious
tenderness
,
as
if
he
have
a
new
fear
of
wounding
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have

obedience

I
will
put
this
letter
into
your
hand

which
you
can
look
at
by
-
and
-
by
.

It
will
merely
tell
you
what
she
wish
you
to
do
,

where
you
will
find
her

"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
hold
out
a
letter
write
on
foreign
paper
,
which
Deronda
thrust
into
his
breast
-
pocket
,
with
a
sense
of
relief
that
he
be
not
call
on
to
read
anything
immediately
.
<EOS>
the
emotion
on
Daniel
's
face
have
gain
on
the
baronet
,
and
be
visibly
shake
his
composure
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
find
it
difficult
to
say
more
.
<EOS>
and
Deronda
's
whole
soul
be
possess
by
a
question
which
be
the
hard
in
the
world
to
utter
.
<EOS>
yet
he
could
not
bear
to
delay
it
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
sacramental
moment
.
<EOS>
if
he
let
it
pass
,
he
could
not
recover
the
influence
under
which
it
be
possible
to
utter
the
word
and
meet
the
answer
.
<EOS>
for
some
moment
his
eye
be
cast
down
,
and
it
seem
to
both
as
if
thought
be
in
the
air
between
them
.
<EOS>
but
at
last
Deronda
look
at
Sir
Hugo
,
and
say
,
with
a
tremulous
reverence
in
his
voice
 
dread
to
convey
indirectly
the
reproach
that
affection
have
for
year
be
stifle
    
"
be
my
father

live
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
answer
come
immediately
in
a
low
emphatic
tone
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
the
mingled
emotion
which
follow
that
answer
it
be
impossible
to
distinguish
joy
from
pain
.
  
<EOS>
some
new
light
have
fall
on
the
past
for
Sir
Hugo
too
in
this
interview
.
<EOS>
after
a
silence
in
which
Deronda
feel
like
one
whose
creed
be
go
before
he
have
religiously
embrace
another
,
the
baronet
say
,
in
a
tone
of
confession
    
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
be
wrong
,
Dan
,
to
undertake
what
I
do

<EOS>
and
perhaps
I
like
it
a
little
too
well

have
you
all
to
myself
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
have
have
any
pain
which
I
may
have
help
,
I
ask
you
to
forgive
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
forgiveness
have
long
be
there
,
"
say
Deronda
"
<EOS>
the
chief
pain
have
always
be
on
account
of
some
one
else
 
whom
I
never

whom
I
be
now
to

It

not

<EOS>
this
letter
with
its
colorless
wording
give
Deronda
no
clue
to
what
be
in
reserve
for
him
;
but
he
could
not
do
otherwise
than
accept
Sir
Hugo
's
reticence
,
which
seem
to
imply
some
pledge
not
to
anticipate
the
mother
's
disclosure
;
and
the
discovery
that
his
life
-
long
conjecture
have
be
mistake
check
further
surmise
.
<EOS>
Deronda
could
not
hinder
his
imagination
from
take
a
quick
flight
over
what
seem
possibility
,
but
he
refuse
to
contemplate
any
of
them
as
more
likely
than
another
,
lest
he
should
be
nurse
it
into
a
dominant
desire
or
repugnance
,
instead
of
simply
prepare
himself
with
resolve
to
meet
the
fact
bravely
,
whatever
it
may
turn
out
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
state
of
mind
he
could
not
have
communicate
to
any
one
the
reason
for
the
absence
which
in
some
quarter
he
be
oblige
to
mention
beforehand
,
least
of
all
to
Mordecai
,
whom
it
would
affect
as
powerfully
as
it
do
himself
,
only
in
rather
a
different
way
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
to
say
,
"
I
be
go
to
learn
the
truth
about
my
birth
,
"
Mordecai
's
hope
would
gather
what
may
prove
a
painful
,
dangerous
excitement
.
<EOS>
to
exclude
supposition
,
he
speak
of
his
journey
as
be
undertake
by
Sir
Hugo
's
wish
,
and
throw
as
much
indifference
as
he
could
into
his
manner
of
announce
it
,
say
he
be
uncertain
of
its
duration
,
but
it
would
perhaps
be
very
short
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
ask
to
have
the
child
Jacob
to
stay
with
me
,
"
say
Mordecai
,
comfort
himself
in
this
way
,
after
the
first
mournful
glance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
drive
round
and
ask
Mrs.
Cohen
to
let
him
come
,
"
say
Mirah
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
grandmother
will
deny
you
nothing
,
"
say
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
you
be
a
little
wrong
as
well
as
I
,
"
he
add
,
smile
at
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
"
You
think
that
old
Mrs.
Cohen
would
not
bear
to
see
Mirah
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
undervalue
her
heart
,
"
say
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
capable
of
rejoice
that
another
's
plant
bloom
though
her
own
be
wither
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
they
be
dear
good
people
;
I
feel
as
if
we
all
belong
to
each
other
,
"
say
Mirah
,
with
a
tinge
of
merriment
in
her
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
should
you
have
feel
if
that
Ezra
have
be
your
brother
?
"
say
Deronda
,
mischievously
 
a
little
provoke
that
she
have
take
kindly
at
once
to
people
who
have
cause
him
so
much
prospective
annoyance
on
her
account
.
  
<EOS>
Mirah
look
at
him
with
a
slight
surprise
for
a
moment
,
and
then
say
,
"
He
be
not
a
bad
man
 
<EOS>
I
think
he
would
never
forsake
any
one
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
when
she
utter
the
word
she
blush
deeply
,
and
glance
timidly
at
Mordecai
,
turn
away
to
some
occupation
.
<EOS>
Her
father
be
in
her
mind
,
and
this
be
a
subject
on
which
she
and
her
brother
have
a
painful
mutual
consciousness
.
<EOS>
"
if
he
should
come
and
find
us
!
"
be
a
thought
which
to
Mirah
sometimes
make
the
street
daylight
as
shadowy
as
a
haunt
forest
where
each
turn
screen
for
her
an
imaginary
apparition
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
feel
what
be
her
involuntary
allusion
,
and
understand
the
blush
.
<EOS>
how
could
he
be
slow
to
understand
feeling
which
now
seem
near
than
ever
to
his
own
?
<EOS>
for
the
word
of
his
mother
's
letter
imply
that
his
filial
relation
be
not
to
be
free
from
painful
condition
;
indeed
,
singularly
enough
that
letter
which
have
bring
his
mother
nearer
as
a
live
reality
have
throw
her
into
more
remoteness
for
his
affection
.
<EOS>
the
tender
yearning
after
a
be
whose
life
may
have
be
the
bad
for
not
have
his
care
and
love
,
the
image
of
a
mother
who
have
not
have
all
her
due
,
whether
of
reverence
or
compassion
,
have
long
be
secretly
present
with
him
in
his
observation
of
all
the
woman
he
have
come
near
.
<EOS>
but
it
seem
now
that
this
picturing
of
his
mother
may
fit
the
fact
no
better
than
his
former
conception
about
Sir
Hugo
.
<EOS>
He
wonder
to
find
that
when
this
mother
's
very
hand
-
writing
have
come
to
him
with
word
hold
her
actual
feeling
,
his
affection
have
suddenly
shrink
into
a
state
of
comparative
neutrality
toward
her
.
<EOS>
a
veiled
figure
with
enigmatic
speech
have
thrust
away
that
image
which
,
in
spite
of
uncertainty
,
his
cling
thought
have
gradually
model
and
make
the
possessor
of
his
tenderness
and
duteous
longing
.
<EOS>
when
he
set
off
to
Genoa
,
the
interest
really
uppermost
in
his
mind
<EOS>
have
hardly
so
much
relation
to
his
mother
as
to
Mordecai
and
Mirah
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
Dan
!
"
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
have
say
,
when
they
shake
hand
.
<EOS>
"
whatever
else
change
for
you
,
it
can
not
change
my
be
the
old
friend
you
have
know
,
and
the
one
who
have
all
along
feel
the
most
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
love
you
better
if
you
would
be
my
own
-
<EOS>
only
I
should
have
be
better
pleased
with
thinking
of
you
always
as
the
future
master
of
the
Abbey
instead
of
my
fine
nephew
;
and
then
you
would
have
see
it
necessary
for
you
to
take
a
political
line
.
<EOS>
however
 
thing
must
be
as
they
may
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
defensive
movement
of
the
baronet
's
to
mingle
purposeless
remark
with
the
expression
of
serious
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
when
Deronda
arrive
at
the
_
Italia
_
in
Genoa
,
no
Princess
Halm
-
Eberstein
be
there
;
but
on
the
second
day
there
be
a
letter
for
him
,
say
that
her
arrival
may
happen
within
a
week
,
or
may
be
defer
a
fortnight
and
more
;
she
be
under
circumstance
which
make
it
impossible
for
her
to
fix
her
journey
more
precisely
,
and
she
entreat
him
to
wait
as
patiently
as
he
could
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
indefinite
prospect
of
suspense
on
matter
of
supreme
moment
to
him
,
Deronda
set
about
the
difficult
task
of
seek
amusement
on
philosophic
ground
,
as
a
means
of
quiet
excited
feeling
and
give
patience
a
lift
over
a
weary
road
.
<EOS>
His
former
visit
to
the
superb
city
have
be
only
cursory
,
and
leave
him
much
to
learn
beyond
the
prescribed
round
of
sight
-
see
,
by
spend
the
cool
hour
in
observant
wander
about
the
street
,
the
quay
,
and
the
environ
;
and
he
often
take
a
boat
that
he
may
enjoy
the
magnificent
view
of
the
city
and
harbor
from
the
sea
.
<EOS>
all

all

,
even

expect

with
his
mother
,
find
a
central
union
in
Mordecai
and
Mirah
,
and
the
idea
immediately
associate
with
them
;
and
among
the
thought
that
most
fill
his
mind
while
his
boat
be

about

<EOS>
inevitably
dreamy
construction
of
a
possible
ancestry
for
himself
would
weave
themselves
with
historic
memory
which
have
begin
to
have
a
new
interest
for
him
on
his
discovery
of
Mirah
,
and
now
,
under
the
influence
of
Mordecai
,
have
become
irresistibly
dominant
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
seal
his
mind
against
such
construction
if
it
have
be
possible
,
and
he
have
never
yet
fully
admit
to
himself
that
he
wish
the
fact
to
verify
Mordecai
's
conviction
:
he
inwardly
repeat
that
he
have
no
choice
in
the
matter
,
and
that
wishing
be
folly
 
nay
,
on
the
question
of
parentage
,
wish
seem
part
of
that
meanness

disown
kinship
:
it
be
a
disowning
by
anticipation

<EOS>
what
he
have
to
do
be
simply
to
accept
the
fact
;
and
he
have
really
no
strong
presumption
to
go
upon
,
now
that
he
be
assure
of
his
mistake
about
Sir
Hugo
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
resolve
concealment
which
make
all
inference
untrustworthy
,
and
the
very
name
he
bear
may
be
a
false
one
.
<EOS>
if
Mordecai
be
wrong
 
if
he
,
the
so
-
call
Daniel
Deronda
,
be
hold
by
tie
entirely
aloof
from
any
such
course
as
his
friend
's
pathetic
hope
have
mark
out
?
 
<EOS>
he
would
not
say
"
I
wish
"
;
but
he
could
not
help
feeling
on
which
side
the
sacrifice
lie
.
  
<EOS>
across
these
two
importunate
thought
,
which
he
resist
as
much
as
one
can
resist
anything
in
that
unstrung
condition
which
belong
to
suspense
,
there
come
continually
an
anxiety
which
he
make
no
effort
to
banish
 
dwell
on
it
rather
with
a
mournfulness
,
which
often
seem
to
us
the
good
atonement
we
can
make
to
one
whose
need
we
have
be
unable
to
meet
.
<EOS>
the
anxiety
be
for
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
in
the
wonderful
mixture
of
our
nature
there
be
a
feeling
distinct
from
that
exclusive
passionate
love
of
which
<EOS>
some
man
and
woman
(
by
no
means
all
)
be
capable
,
which
yet
be
not
the
same
with
friendship
,
nor
with
a
merely
benevolent
regard
,
whether
admiring
or
compassionate
:
a
man
,
say
 
for
it
be
a
man
who
be
here
concerned
 
hardly
represent
to
himself
this
shade
of
feeling
toward
a
woman
more
nearly
than
in
word
,
"
I
should
have
love
her
,
if
   
"
:
the
"
if
"
cover
some
prior
growth
in
the
inclination
,
or
else
some
circumstance
which
have
make
an
inward
prohibitory
law
as
a
stay
against
the
emotion
ready
to
quiver
out
of
balance
.
<EOS>
the
"
if
"
in
Deronda
's
case
carry
reason
of
both
kind
;
yet
he
have
never
throughout
his
relation
with
Gwendolen
be
free
from
the
nervous
consciousness
that
there
be
something
to
guard
against
not
only
on
her
account
but
on
his
own
 
some
precipitancy
in
the
manifestation
of
impulsive
feeling
 
some
ruinous
inroad
of
what
be
but
momentary
on
the
permanent
choose
treasure
of
the
heart
 
<EOS>
some
spoiling
of
her
trust
,
which
work
upon
him
now
as
if
it
have
be
the
retreat
cry
of
a
creature
snatch
and
carry
out
of
his
reach
by
swift
horseman
or
swift
wave
,
while
his
own
strength
be
only
a
strong
sense
of
weakness
.
<EOS>
how
could
his
feeling
for
Gwendolen
ever
be
exactly
like
his
feeling
for
other
woman
,
even
when
there
be
one
by
whose
side
he
desire
to
stand
apart
from
them
?
<EOS>
strangely
the
figure
enter
into
the
picture
of
his
present
and
future
;
strangely
(
and
now
it
seem
sadly
)
<EOS>
their
two
lot
have
come
in
contact
,
her
narrowly
personal
,
his
charge
with
far
-
reach
sensibility
,
perhaps
with
durable
purpose
,
which
be
hardly
more
present
to
her
than
the
reason
why
man
migrate
be
present
to
the
bird
that
come
as
usual
for
the
crumb
and
find
them
no
more
.
<EOS>
not
that
Deronda
be
too
ready
to
imagine
himself
of
supreme
importance
to
a
woman
;
but
her
word
of
insistance
that
he
must
"
remain
near
her
 
must
not
forsake
her
<EOS>
"
 
continually
recur
to
him
with
the
clearness
and
importunity
of
imagine
sound
,
such
as
Dante
have
say
pierce
us
like
arrow
whose
point
carry
the
sharpness
of
pity

"
  
day
after
day
pass
,
and
the
very
air
of
Italy
seem
to
carry
the
consciousness
that
war
have
be

against
Austria
,
and
every
day
be
a
hurry
march
of
crowded
Time
toward

with

with

seem
also
to
come
forth

beauty
after
their
long
siesta
,
till
all
strong
color
melt
in
the

Deronda
,
in
his
suspense

watch
this
revolving
of

day
as
he
may
have
watch
a
wonderful
clock
where
the
striking
of
the
hour
be
make
solemn
with
antique
figure
advance
and
retreat
in
monitory
procession
,
while
he
still
keep
his
ear
open
for
another
kind
of
signal
which
would
have
its
solemnity
too
:
He
be
begin
to
sicken
of
occupation
,
and
find
himself
contemplate
all
activity
with
the
aloofness
of
a
prisoner
await
ransom
.
<EOS>
in
his
letter
to
Mordecai
and
Hans
,
he
have
avoid
write
about
himself
,
but
he
be
really
get
into
that
state
of
mind
to
which
all
subject
become
personal
;
and
the
few
book
he
have
bring
to
make
him
a
refuge
in
study
be
become
unreadable
,
because
the
point
of
view
that
life
would
make
for
him
be
in
that
agitate
moment
of
uncertainty
which
be
close
upon

<EOS>
many
night
be
watch
through
by
him
in
gaze
from
the
open
window
of
his
room
on
the
double
,
faintly
pierce
darkness
of
the
sea

the

often
in
struggle
under
the
oppressive
skepticism
which
represent
his

lot

with
all
the
importance
he
be
allow
Mordecai
to
give
it
,
as
of
no
more
lasting
effect
than
a
dream
 
a
set
of
change
which
make
passion
to
him
,
but
beyond
his
consciousness
be
no
more
than
an
imperceptible
difference
of
mass
and
shadow
;
sometimes
with
a
reaction
of
emotive
force
which
give
even
to
sustain
disappointment
,
even
to
the
fulfilled
demand
of
sacrifice
,
the
nature
of
a
satisfied
energy
,
and
spread
over
his
young
future
,
whatever
it
may
be
,
the
attraction
of
devoted
service
;
sometimes
with
a
sweet
irresistible
hopefulness
that
the
very
good
of
human
possibility
may
befall
him
 
the
blending
of
a
complete
personal
love
in
one
current
with
a
large
duty
;
and
sometimes
again
in
a
mood
of
rebellion
(
what
human
creature
escape
it
?
)
<EOS>
against
thing
in
general
because
they
be
thus
and
not
otherwise
,
a
mood
in
which
Gwendolen
and
her
equivocal
fate
move
as
busy
image
of
what
be
amiss
in
the
world
along
with
the
concealment
which
he
have
feel
as
a
hardship
in
his
own
life

which
be
act
in
him
now
under
the
form
of
an
afflict
doubtfulness
about
the
mother
who
have
announce
herself
coldly
and
still
keep
away
.
  
<EOS>
but
at
last
she
be
come
.
<EOS>
one
morning
in
his
third
week
of
wait
there
be
a
new
kind
of
knock
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
a
servant
in
Chasseurs
livery
enter
and
deliver
in
French
the
verbal
message
that
,
the
Princess
Halm
-
Eberstein
have
arrive
,
that
she
be
go
to
rest
during
the
day
,
but
would
be
oblige
if
Monsieur
would
dine
early
,
so
as
to
be
at
liberty
at
seven
,
when
she
would
be
able
to
receive
him
.
        
<EOS>
She
hold
the
spindle
as
she
sit
,
    
Errina
with
the
thick
-
coil
mat
    
of
raven
hair
and
deep
agate
eye
,
    
gaze
with
a
sad
surprise
    
<EOS>
at
surge
vision
of
her
destiny
      
to
spin
the
byssus
drearily
    
in
insect
-
labor
,
while
the
throng
  
of
god
and
man
work
deed
that
poet
work
in
song
.
   
<EOS>
when
Deronda
present
himself
at
the
door
of
his
mother
's
apartment
in
the
_
Italia
_
he
feel
some
revival
of
his
boyhood
with
its
premature
agitation
.
<EOS>
the
two
servant
in
the
antechamber
look
at
him
markedly
,
a
little
surprised
that
the
doctor
their
lady
have
come
to
consult
<EOS>
be
this
striking
young
gentleman
whose
appearance
give
even
the
severe
line
of
an
evening
dress
the
credit
of
adornment
.
<EOS>
but
Deronda
could
notice
nothing
until
,
the
second
door
be
open
,
he
find
himself
in
the
presence
of
a
figure
which
at
the
other
end
of
the
large
room
stand
await
his
approach
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
cover
,
except
as
to
her
face
and
part
of
her
arm
,
with
black
lace
hang
loosely
from
the
summit
of
her
whiten
hair
to
the
long
train
stretch
from
her
tall
figure
.
<EOS>
Her
arm
,
naked
to
the
elbow
,
except
for
some
rich
bracelet
,
be
fold
before
her
,
and
the
fine
poise
of
her
head
make
it
look
handsome
than
it
really
be
.
<EOS>
but
Deronda
feel
no
interval
of
observation
before
he
be
close
in
front
of
her
,
hold
the
hand
she
have
put
out
and
then
raise
it
to
his
lip
.
<EOS>
She
still
keep
her
hand
in
his
and
look
at
him
examiningly
;
while
his
chief
consciousness
be
that
her
eye
be
pierce
and
her
face
<EOS>
so
mobile
that
the
next
moment
she
may
look
like
a
different
person
.
<EOS>
for
even
while
she
be
examine
him
there
be
a
play
of
the
brow
and
nostril
which
make
a
tacit
language
.
<EOS>
Deronda
dare
no
movement
,
not
able
to
conceive
what
sort
of
manifestation
her
feeling
demand
;
but
he
feel
himself
change
color
like
a
girl
,
and
yet
wonder
at
his
own
lack
of
emotion
;
he
have
live
through
so
many
ideal
meeting
with
his
mother
,
and
they
have
seem
more
real
than
this
!
<EOS>
He
could
not
even
conjecture
in
what
language
she
would
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
imagine
it
would
not
be
English
.
<EOS>
suddenly
,
she
let
fall
his
hand
,
and
place
both
her
on
his
shoulder
,
while
her
face
give
out
a
flash
of
admiration
in
which
every
wear
line
disappear
and
seem
to
leave
a
restore
youth
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
beautiful
creature
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
in
a
low
melodious
voice
,
with
syllable
which
have
what
may
be
call
a
foreign
but
agreeable
outline
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
would
be
.
"
<EOS>
then
she
kiss
him
on
each
cheek
,
and
he
return
the
kiss
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
something
like
a
greeting
between
royalty
.
  
<EOS>
She
pause
a
moment
while
the
line
be
come
back
into
her
face
,
and
then
say
in
a
cold
tone
,
"
I
be
your
mother
.
<EOS>
but
you
can
have
no
love
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
think
of
you
more
than
of
any
other
be
in
the
world
,
"
say
Deronda
,
his
voice
tremble
nervously
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
like
what
you
think
I
be
,
"
say
the
mother
decisively
,
withdraw
her
hand
from
his
shoulder
,
and
fold
her
arm
as
before
,
look
at
him
as
if
she
invite
him
to
observe
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
often
picture
her
face
in
his
imagination
as
one
which
have
a
likeness
to
his
own
:
he
see
some
of
the
likeness
now
,
but
amidst
more
striking
difference
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
remarkable
looking
being
.
<EOS>
what
be
it
that
give
her
son
a
painful
sense
of
aloofness
?
 
<EOS>
Her
worn
beauty
have
a
strangeness
in
it
as
if
she
be
not
quite
a
human
mother
,
but
a
Melusina
,
who
have
tie
with
some
world
which
be
independent
of
ours
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
use
to
think
that
you
may
be
suffer
,
"
say
Deronda
,
anxious
above
all
not
to
wound
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
use
to
wish
that
I
could
be
a
comfort
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
_
be
_
suffer
.
<EOS>
but
with
a
suffering
that
you
can
not
comfort
,
"
say
the
Princess
,
in
a
hard
voice
than
before
,
move
to
a
sofa
where
cushion
have
be
carefully
arrange
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
sit
down
.
"
<EOS>
She
point
to
a
seat
near
her
;
and
then
discern
some
distress
in
Deronda
's
face
,
she
add
,
more
gently
,
"
I
be
not
suffer
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
I
be
at
ease
now
.
<EOS>
I
be
able
to
talk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
seat
himself
and
wait
for
her
to
speak
again
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
he
be
in
the
presence
of
a
mysterious
Fate
rather
than
of
the
long
-
for
mother
.
<EOS>
He
be
begin
to
watch
her
with
wonder
,
from
the
spiritual
distance
to
which
she
have
throw
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
she
begin
:
"
I
do
not
send
for
you
to
comfort
me
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
know
beforehand
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
now
 
what
you
will
feel
toward
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
foolish
notion
that
you
can
love
me
merely
because
I
be
your
mother
,
when
you
have
never
see
or
hear
of
me
in
all
your
life

<EOS>
but
I
think
I
choose
something
well
for
you
than
be
with
me

<EOS>
I
do
not

I
deprive
you
of
anything
worth

<EOS>
"
You
can
not
wish
me
to
believe
that
your
affection
would
not
have

worth

"
say
Deronda
,
find
that
she
pause
as
if
she
expect
him
to
make
some
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
to
speak
ill
of
myself
,
"
say
the
princess
,
with
proud
impetuosity
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
not
much
affection
to
give
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
affection

<EOS>
I
have
be
stifle
with
it

<EOS>
I
want
to
live
out
the
life
that

not

<EOS>
You
wonder
what
I

<EOS>
I
be
no
princess
then

"
She
rise
with
a
sudden
movement
,
and
stand
as
she
have
do
before
.
<EOS>
Deronda
immediately
rise
too
;
he
feel
breathless

She
seem
to
fling
out
the

word
against
some
possible
reproach
in
the
mind
of
her
son

who
have
to

and
hear

him

She
go
on
with
the

intensity
and
a
sort
of
pale
illumination
in
her
face

herself
again

be
that
subtle
movement
in

eye

closed

be
like
the
suppress
continuation

Deronda
continue

up
at

defiant
pleading

Deronda
burst
out
with
a
deep

voice
energy
that
make
his

shrink
a
little
backward
against
her
cushion

<EOS>
"
yes

say
the
mother
,
watch
him
with
a
change
in
her
look
,
as
if
she
see
something
that
she
may
have
to
be
afraid
of
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
of
it

say
Deronda
,
impetuously
,
in
the
veiled
voice
of
passion
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
imagine
beforehand
how
he
would
have
come
to
say
that
which
he
have
never
hitherto
admit
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
dream
that
it
would
be
in
impulsive
opposition
to
his
mother
.
<EOS>
He
be
shake
by
a
mixed
anger
which
no
reflection
could
come
soon
enough
to
check
,
against
this
mother
who
it
seem
have
bear
him
unwillingly
,
have
willingly
make
herself
a
stranger
to
him
,
and
 
perhaps
 
be
now
make
herself
know
unwillingly
.
<EOS>
this
last
suspicion
seem
to
flash
some
explanation
over
her
speech
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
mother
be
equally
shake
by
an
anger
differently
mixed
,
and
her
frame
be
less
equal
to
any
repression
.
<EOS>
the
shaking
with
her
be
visibly
physical
,
and
her
eye
look
the
large
for
her
pallid
excitement
as
she
say
violently
    
<EOS>
"
why
do
you

say
Deronda
,
throw
himself
sideways
into
his
chair
again
,
almost
unconsciously
,
and
lean
his
arm
over
the
back
,
while
he
look
away
from
his

<EOS>
He
be
fire
with
an
intolerance
that
seem
foreign

him

<EOS>
but
he
be
now
try
hard
to
master
himself

keep
silence

<EOS>
a
horror
have
sweep
in
upon
his
anger
lest
he
should
say
something
too
hard
in
this
moment
which
make
an
epoch
never
to
be
recall
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
pause
before
his
mother
speak
again
,
and
when
she
speak
her
voice
have
become
more
firmly
resistant
in
its
finely
varied
tone
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
choose
for
you
what
I
would
have
choose
for
myself

<EOS>
how
could
I
know

"
the
last
word
have
such
bitterness
in
them
that
any
one
overhearing
may
have
suppose
some
hatred
have
arise
between
the
mother
and
son

<EOS>
but
Deronda
have
recover
his
full
self

<EOS>
He
be
recall
his
sensibility
to
what
life
have
be
and
actually
be
for
her
whose
good
year
be
go

and
who
with
the
sign
of
suffer
in
her
frame
be
now
exert
herself
to
tell
him
of
a
past
which
be
not
his
alone
but
also
hers

<EOS>
His
habitual
shame
at
the
acceptance
of
event
as
if
they
be
his
only
,
help
him
even
here
.
<EOS>
as
he
look
at
his
mother
silently
after
her
last
word
,
his
face
regain
some
of
its
penetrative
calm
;
yet
it
seem
to
have
a
strangely
agitate
influence
over
her
:
her
eye
be
fix
on
him
with
a
sort
of
fascination
,
but
not
with
any
repose
of
maternal
delight
.
  
<EOS>
"
forgive
me
,
if
I
speak
hastily

he
say
,
with
diffident
gravity
.

with
a
ring
of
something

sarcastic
scorn

People
talk

<EOS>
when
you
reproach
me
in

you

<EOS>
the
varied
transition
of
tone
with
which
this
speech
be
deliver
be
as
perfect
as
the
most
accomplished
actress
could
have
make
them
.
<EOS>
the
speech
be
in
fact
a
piece
of
what
may
be
call
sincere
acting
;
this
woman
's
nature
be
one
in
which
all
feel
 
and
all
the
more
when
it
be
tragic
as
well
as
real
 
immediately
become
matter
of
conscious
representation
:
experience
immediately
pass
into
drama
,
and
she
act
her
own
emotion
.
<EOS>
in
a
minor
degree
this
be
nothing
uncommon
,
but
in
the
Princess
the
acting
have
a
rare
perfection
of
physiognomy
,
voice
,
and
gesture
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
true
to
say
that
she
feel
less
because
of
this
double
consciousness
:
she
feel
 
that
is
,
her
mind
go
through
 
all
the
more
,
but
with
a
difference
;
each
nucleus
of
pain
or
pleasure
have
a
deep
atmosphere
of
the
excitement
or
spiritual
intoxication
<EOS>
which
at
once
exalt
and
deaden
.
<EOS>
but
Deronda
make
no
reflection
of
this
kind
.
<EOS>
all
his
thought
hang
on
the
purport
of
what
his
mother
be
say
;
her
tone
and
her
wonderful
face
enter
into
his
agitation
without
be
note
.
<EOS>
what
he
long
for
with
an
awed
desire
be
to
know
as
much
as
she
would
tell
him
of
the
strange
mental
conflict
under
which
it
seem
he
have
be
bring
into
the
world
;
what
his
compassionate
nature
make
the
control
idea
within
him
be
the
suffering
and
the
confession
that
breathe
through
her
later
word
,
and
these
forbid
any
further
question
,
when
she
pause
and
remain
silent
,
with
her
brow
knit
,
her
head
turn
a
little
away
from
him
,
and
her
large
eye
fix
as
if
on
something
incorporeal
.
<EOS>
He
must
wait
for
her
to
speak
again
.
<EOS>
She
do
so
with
strange
abruptness
,
turn
her
eye
upon
him
suddenly
,
and
say
more
quickly
    
<EOS>
"

her
sharp
gaze
solemnly

It
be
a
bitter
reversal

some
understanding

become

in

never

<EOS>
this

sentence

utter
with
an
abrupt
emphasis

she
pause
after
it
as
if
the

raise
a
crowd
of
remembrance
which
obstruct

Her

more
highly

the
frank
coldness
which
have
replace
all
his
preconception
of
a

all
these
busy
element

collision
between

subside
for

make
more

more
room
for
that
effort
at
just
allowance

that
admiration
of
a
forcible
nature
whose
error
lie
along
high
pathway

which
he
would
have

,
instead
of

his

she
have
be
a
stranger
who
have
appeal
to
his
sympathy

<EOS>
still
it
be
impossible
to
be
dispassionate
:
he
tremble
lest
the
next
thing
she
have
to
say
would
be
more
repugnant
to
him
than
what
have
go
before
:
he
be
afraid
of
the
strange
coërcion
<EOS>
she
seem
to
be
under
to
lay
her
mind
bare
:
he
almost
wish
he
could
say
,
"
tell
me
only
what
be
necessary
,
"
and
then
again
he
feel
the
fascination
which
make
him
watch
her
and
listen
to
her
eagerly
.
<EOS>
He
try
to
recall
her
to
particular
by
ask
    
<EOS>
"
where

my

country

"
You

My

English
 
<EOS>
a
Jewess
of
portuguese
descent

<EOS>
My
father
marry
her
in
England
.
<EOS>
certain
circumstance
of
that
marriage
make
all
the
difference
in
my
life
:
through
that
marriage
my
father
thwart
his
own
plan
.
<EOS>
My
mother
's
sister
be
a
singer
,
and
afterward
she
marry
the
english
partner
of
a
merchant
's
house
here
in
Genoa
,
and
they
come
and
live
here
eleven
year
.
<EOS>
My
mother
die
when
I
be
eight
year
old
,
and
my
father
allow
me
to
be
continually
with
my
Aunt
Leonora
and
be
teach
under
her
eye
,
as
if
he
have
not
mind
the
danger
of
her
encourage
my
wish
to
be
a
singer
,
as
she
have
be
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
it
 
<EOS>
I
see
it
again
and
again
in
my
father
:
 
<EOS>
he
do
not
guard
against
consequence
,
because
he
feel
sure
he
could
hinder
them
if
he
like
.
<EOS>
before
my
aunt
leave
Genoa
,
I
have
have
enough
teaching
to
bring
out
the
bear
singer
and
actress
within
me
:
my
father
do
not
know
everything
that
be
do
;
but
he
know
that
I
be
teach
music
and
singe
 
<EOS>
he
know
my
inclination
.
<EOS>
that
be
nothing
to
him
:
he
mean
that
I
should
obey
his
will
.
<EOS>
and
he
be
resolve
that
I
should
marry
my
cousin
Ephraim
,
the
only
one
left
of
my
father
's
family
that
he
know
.
<EOS>
I
want
not
to
marry
.
<EOS>
I
think
of
all
plan
to
resist
it
,
but
at
last
I
find
that
I
could
rule
my
cousin
,
and
I
consent
.
<EOS>
My
father
die
three
week
after
we
be
married
,
and
then
I
have
my
way

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
utter
these
word
almost
exultantly
;
but
after
a
little
pause
her
face
change
,
and
she
say
in
a
biting
tone
,
"
It

<EOS>
My

"
  
<EOS>
She
begin
to
look
more
contemplatively
again
at
her
son
,
and
presently
say
    
"
You
be
like
him
 
<EOS>
but
milder
 
there
be
something
of
your

he
make
it
the
labor

his

to
devote
himself

<EOS>
He
draw
his
chair
nearer
to
her
and
give
her
his
hand
.
<EOS>
We
know
what
kind
of
a
hand
it
be
:
her
own
,
very
much
small
,
be
of
the
same
type

as
he
feel
the
small
hand
hold
his
,
as
he
see
near
to
him
the
face
that
hold
the
likeness
of
his
own
,
aged
not
by
time
but
by
intensity
,
the
strong
bent
of
his
nature
toward
a
reverential
tenderness
assert
itself
above
every
other
impression
and
in
his
most
fervent
tone
<EOS>
he
say
    
"
Mother

<EOS>
She
look
at
him
admiringly
rather
than
lovingly
,
then
kiss
him
on
the
brow
,
and
say
sadly
,
"
I
reject
nothing
,
but
I
have
nothing
to
give

she
release
his
hand
and
sink
back
on
her
cushion

Deronda
turn
pale
with
what
seem
always
more
of
a
sensation
than
an
emotion
 
<EOS>
the
pain
of
repulse
tenderness
.
<EOS>
She
notice
the
expression
of
pain
,
and
say
,
still
with
melodious
melancholy
in
her
tone
    
<EOS>
"
It

day

ask

money

such
a
boy

I
have
not
meditate
much
on
the
plan
beforehand

as
soon
as
I
have
speak
about
it

it
take
possession
of
me
as
something
I
could
not
rest
without
do

at
first
he
think
I
be
not
serious

I
convince
him

he
be
never

at
anything

He
agree
that
it
would
be
for
your

the
fine

tyrannize
over

Deronda

with
an
intensity

agony

I
dare
<EOS>

all

all

forsook
me

then
a
great
horror
come
over
me

what

of
life

death

what
my
father
call

may
be
a
power

I

recollection

some
vengeance
send

He
be
my
father

friend

He
know
of
your
birth

he
know
of
my

once

twenty
year

after

have
be
away
in
the
Levant

he
come
to
see
me
and
inquire
about
you

I
tell

that
you
be
dead

I

you
to
be
dead
to
all
the

of
my
childhood

if
I
have
say
that
your
be

he
would
have
interfere
with
my
plan

he
would
have
take
on
him
to
represent
my

have
try
to
make
me
recall
what
I
have
do

what
could
I
do

say
you
be
dead

the
act
be
do

<EOS>
if
I
have
tell
him
of
it
there
would
have

trouble

all
to
conquer
me

who
would
not

be
conquer

I
be
strong
then
,

I
would
have
have
my
will

though
there
may
have
be
a
hard
fight
against
me

<EOS>
I
take
the
way
to
have
it
without
any
fight

<EOS>
I
feel
then
that
I
be
not
really
deceive
:
it
would
have
come
to
the
same
in
the
end
;
or
if
not
to
the
same
,
to
something
bad

<EOS>
He
believe
me
and
beg
that
I
would
give
up
to
him
the
chest
that
my

have
charge
me

my

to
deliver
to
our

know
what
be

any
understanding
 
thing

be
thrust
on
my

I

them
like
a

my

grow

<EOS>
once
,
after
my

die
,
I
be
go
to
burn
the
chest
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
difficult
to
burn
;
and
burn
a
chest
and
paper
look
like
a
shameful
act
.
<EOS>
I
have
commit
no
shameful
act
 
except
what
Jews
would
call
shameful
.
<EOS>
I
have
keep
the
chest
,
and
I
give
it
to
Joseph
Kalonymos
.
<EOS>
He
go
away
mournful
,
and
say
,
"
if
you
marry
again

if
another

to
him

I

up
the

him

I
bow
in
silence

I

She
cease

sink
back

she
look
vaguely
before

<EOS>
Her
thought
be
travel
through
the
year

when
she
begin
to
speak
again
her
voice
have
lose
its
argumentative
spirit

have
fall
into
a
veiled
tone
of
distress

"
but
month
ago
this
Kalonymos
see
you
in

indifferently

<EOS>
the
Jews
have
always

My

family
have
keep

a
Charisi

<EOS>
when
I
come
out
as
a
singer

we
make
it
alcharisi

there
have
be
a
branch
of
the
family
my
father
have
lose
sight
of
who
call
themselves
Deronda

when
I
want
a
name
for
you

Sir
Hugo
say
,
"
let
it
be

Deronda

but
Joseph
Kalonymos
have
hear
my
father
speak
of

Deronda
branch

the
name
confirm
his
suspicion

<EOS>
He
begin
to
suspect
what
have
be
do

It
be
as
if
everything
have
be
whisper
to
him
in

He
find
out
where
I
be

<EOS>
He
take
a
journey
into
Russia
to
see
me
;
he
find
me
weak
and
shatter
.
<EOS>
He
have
come
back
again
,
with
his
white
hair
,
and
with
rage
in
his
soul
against
me

<EOS>
He
say
I
be
go
down
to
the
grave
clothe
in
falsehood

robbery
 
falsehood

He
accuse
me
of

keep
the
knowledge

your
birth
from
you

and
have
bring
you
up
as
if
you

the
son
of
an
english
gentleman

<EOS>
well
,
it
be
true
;

twenty
year
before
I
would
have
maintain
that
I

a
right
to
do
it

I
can
maintain

little
in

toned
pleading

repulse
before

His
pity
make
a
flood
of
forgiveness
within
him

His
single
impulse
be
to
kneel
by
her

take
her
hand
gently
,
between
his
palm

he
say
in

exquisite
voice

down
at

take
both
her

gradually
tear
gather

she
press
her
handkerchief

from

<EOS>
my
dear
deronda
,
 
<EOS>
in
return
for
your
sketch
of
italian
movement
and
    
your
view
of
the
world
's
affair
generally
,
I
may
say
that
here
at
    
home
the
most
judicious
opinion
go
as
to
the
effect
of
present
    
cause
<EOS>
be
that

"
<EOS>
as
to
the
present
cause
of
past
    
effect
,
it
be
now
see
that
the
late
swindling
telegram
account
for
    
the
last
year
's
cattle
plague
 
which
be
a
refutation
of
philosophy
    
falsely
so
call
,
and
justify
the
compensation
to
the
farmer
.
<EOS>
My
    
own
idea
that
a
murrain
will
shortly
break
out
in
the
commercial
    
class
,
and
that
the
cause
will
subsequently
disclose
itself
in
the
    
ready
sale
of
all
reject
picture
,
have
be
call
an
unsound
use
of
    
analogy
;
but
there
be
mind
that
will
not
hesitate
to
rob
even
the
    
neglect
painter
of
his
solace
.
<EOS>
to
my
feeling
there
be
great
beauty
    
in
the
conception
that
some
bad
judge
may
give
a
high
price
for
my
    
Berenice
series
,
and
that
the
man
in
the
city
would
have
already
be
    
punish
for
my
ill
-
merit
luck
.
      
<EOS>
meanwhile
I
be
console
myself
for
your
absence
by
find
my
    
advantage
in
it
 
shine
like
Hesperus
when
Hyperion
have
depart
;
    
sit
with
our
hebrew
prophet
,
and
make
a
study
of
his
head
,
in
    
the
hour
when
he
use
to
be
occupy
with
you
 
get
credit
with
    
him
as
a
learn
young
Gentile
,
who
would
have
be
a
Jew
if
he
could
      
and
agree
with
him
in
the
general
principle
,
that
whatever
be
    
best
be
for
that
reason
jewish
.
<EOS>
I
never
hold
it
<EOS>
my
_
forte
_
to
be
    
a
severe
reasoner
,
but
I
can
see
that
if
whatever
be
good
be
a
,
and
B
    
happen
to
be
good
,
b
must
be
a
<EOS>
,
however
little
you
may
have
    
expect
it
beforehand
.
<EOS>
on
that
principle
I
could
see
the
force
of
a
    
pamphlet
I
once
read
to
prove
that
all
good
art
be
protestant
.
    
<EOS>
however
,
our
prophet
be
an
uncommonly
interesting
sitter
 
a
well
    
model
than
Rembrandt
have
for
his
Rabbi
 
<EOS>
and
I
never
come
away
from
him
    
without
a
new
discovery
.
<EOS>
for
one
thing
,
it
be
a
constant
wonder
to
me
    
<EOS>
that
,
with
all
his
fiery
feeling
for
his
race
and
their
tradition
,
he
    
be
no
straight
-
laced
Jew
,
spit
after
the
word
Christian
,
and
    
enjoy
the
prospect
that
the
Gentile
mouth
will
water
in
vain
for
a
    
slice
of
the
roasted
Leviathan
,
while
Israel
will
be
send
up
plate
    
for
more
,
<EOS>
_
ad
libitum
_
,
(
You
perceive
that
my
study
have
teach
    
me
what
to
expect
from
the
orthodox
Jew
.
)
<EOS>
I
confess
that
I
have
always
    
hold
lightly
by
your
account
of
Mordecai
,
as
apologetic
,
and
merely
    
part
of
your
disposition
to
make
an
antedeluvian
point
of
view
lest
    
you
should
do
injustice
to
the
megatherium
.
<EOS>
but
now
I
have
give
ear
    
to
him
in
his
proper
person
<EOS>
,
I
find
him
really
a
sort
of
    
philosophical
-
allegorical
-
mystical
believer
,
and
yet
with
a
sharp
    
dialectic
point
,
so
that
any
argumentative
rattler
of
pea
in
a
    
bladder
may
soon
be
prick
in
silence
by
him
.
<EOS>
the
mixture
may
be
    
one
of
the
jewish
prerogative
,
for
what
I
know
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
his
mind
    
seem
so
broad
that
I
find
my
own
correct
opinion
lie
in
it
quite
    
commodiously
,
and
how
they
be
to
be
bring
into
agreement
with
the
    
vast
remainder
<EOS>
be
his
affair
,
not
mine
.
<EOS>
I
leave
it
to
him
to
settle
    
our
basis
,
never
yet
have
see
a
basis
which
be
not
a
    
world
-
support
elephant
,
more
or
less
powerful
and
expensive
to
keep
.
    
<EOS>
My
mean
will
not
allow
me
to
keep
a
private
elephant
.
<EOS>
I
go
into
mystery
    
instead
,
as
cheap
and
more
lasting
 
a
sort
of
gas
which
be
likely
to
    
be
continually
supply
by
the
decomposition
of
the
elephant
.
<EOS>
and
if
    
I
like
the
look
of
an
opinion
,
I
treat
it
civilly
,
without
suspicious
    
inquiry
.
<EOS>
I
have
quite
a
friendly
feeling
toward
Mordecai
's
notion
    
that
a
whole
Christian
be
three
-
fourth
a
Jew
,
and
that
from
the
    
alexandrian
time
downward
the
most
comprehensive
mind
have
be
    
jewish
;
for
I
think
of
point
out
to
Mirah
that
,
arabic
and
other
    
incident
of
life
apart
,
there
be
really
little
difference
between
me
    
and
 
Maimonides
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
lately
be
find
out
that
it
be
your
    
shallow
lover
who
can
not
help
make
a
declaration
.
<EOS>
if
Mirah
's
way
    
be
less
distracting
,
and
it
be
less
of
a
heaven
to
be
in
her
    
presence
and
watch
her
,
I
must
long
ago
have
fling
myself
at
her
foot
,
    
and
request
her
to
tell
me
,
with
less
indirectness
,
whether
she
    
wish
me
to
blow
my
brain
out
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
knack
of
hoping
,
which
be
as
    
good
as
an
estate
in
reversion
,
if
one
can
keep
from
the
temptation
of
    
turn
it
into
certainty
,
which
may
spoil
all
.
<EOS>
My
Hope
wander
among
    
the
orchard
blossom
,
feel
the
warm
snow
fall
on
it
through
the
    
sunshine
,
and
be
in
doubt
of
nothing
;
but
,
catch
sight
of
Certainty
    
in
the
distance
,
see
an
ugly
Janus
-
face
deity
,
with
a
dubious
wink
    
on
the
hither
side
of
him
,
and
turn
quickly
away
.
<EOS>
but
you
,
with
your
    
supreme
reasonableness
,
and
self
-
nullification
,
and
preparation
for
    
the
bad
 
you
know
nothing
about
Hope
,
that
immortal
,
delicious
    
maiden
forever
court
forever
propitious
,
whom
fool
have
call
    
deceitful
,
as
if
it
be
Hope
that
carry
the
cup
of
disappointment
,
    
whereas
it
be
her
deadly
enemy
,
Certainty
,
whom
she
only
escape
by
    
transformation
.
<EOS>
(
You
observe
my
new
vein
of
allegory
?
)
<EOS>
seriously
,
    
however
,
I
must
be
permit
to
allege
that
truth
will
prevail
,
that
    
prejudice
will
melt
before
it
,
that
diversity
,
accompany
by
merit
,
    
will
make
itself
feel
as
fascination
,
and
that
no
virtuous
aspiration
    
will
be
frustrate
 
all
which
,
if
I
mistake
not
,
be
doctrine
of
the
    
school
,
and
they
imply
that
the
Jewess
I
prefer
will
prefer
me
.
<EOS>
any
    
blockhead
can
cite
generality
,
but
the
mind
-
master
discern
the
    
particular
case
they
represent
.
      
<EOS>
I
be
less
convinced
that
my
society
make
amend
to
Mordecai
for
your
    
absence
,
but
another
substitute
occasionally
come
in
the
form
of
    
Jacob
Cohen
.
<EOS>
It
be
worth
while
to
catch
our
prophet
's
expression
when
    
he
have
that
remarkable
type
of
young
Israel
on
his
knee
,
and
pour
    
forth
some
semitic
inspiration
with
a
sublime
look
of
melancholy
    
patience
and
devoutness
.
<EOS>
sometimes
it
occur
to
Jacob
that
Hebrew
will
    
be
more
edifying
to
him
if
he
stop
his
ear
with
his
palm
,
and
    
imitate
the
venerable
sound
as
hear
through
that
muffled
medium
.
    
<EOS>
when
Mordecai
gently
draw
down
the
little
fist
and
hold
them
fast
,
    
Jacob
's
feature
all
take
on
an
extraordinary
activity
,
very
much
as
    
if
he
be
walk
through
a
menagerie
and
try
to
imitate
every
    
animal
in
turn
,
succeed
best
with
the
owl
and
the
peccary
.
<EOS>
but
I
    
dare
say
you
have
see
something
of
this
.
<EOS>
He
treat
me
with
the
    
easy
familiarity
,
and
seem
in
general
to
look
at
me
as
a
second
-
hand
    
christian
commodity
,
likely
to
come
down
in
price
;
remark
on
    
my
disadvantage
with
a
frankness
which
seem
to
imply
some
thought
    
of
future
purchase
.
<EOS>
It
be
pretty
,
though
,
to
see
the
change
in
him
if
    
Mirah
happen
to
come
in
.
<EOS>
He
turn
child
suddenly
 
his
age
usually
    
strike
one
as
be
like
the
israelitish
garment
in
the
desert
,
    
perhaps
near
forty
,
yet
with
an
air
of
recent
production
.
<EOS>
but
,
with
    
Mirah
,
he
remind
me
of
the
dog
that
have
be
bring
up
by
woman
,
    
and
remain
manageable
by
them
only
.
<EOS>
still
,
the
dog
be
fond
of
Mordecai
    
too
,
and
bring
sugar
-
plum
to
share
with
him
,
fill
his
own
mouth
    
to
rather
an
embarrassing
extent
,
and
watch
how
Mordecai
deal
with
    
a
small
supply
.
<EOS>
judge
from
this
modern
Jacob
at
the
age
of
six
,
my
    
astonishment
be
that
his
race
have
not
buy
us
all
up
long
ago
,
and
    
pocket
our
feebler
generation
in
the
form
of
stock
and
scrip
,
as
so
    
much
slave
property
.
<EOS>
there
be
one
Jewess
I
should
not
mind
be
slave
    
to
.
<EOS>
but
I
wish
I
do
not
imagine
that
Mirah
get
a
little
sad
,
and
    
try
all
the
while
to
hide
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
natural
enough
,
of
course
,
while
    
she
have
to
watch
the
slow
death
of
this
brother
,
whom
she
have
take
to
    
worship
with
such
look
of
love
devoutness
that
I
be
ready
to
    
wish
myself
in
his
place
.
      
<EOS>
for
the
rest
,
we
be
a
little
merry
than
usual
.
<EOS>
Rex
Gascoigne
 
<EOS>
you
    
remember
a
head
you
admire
among
my
sketch
,
a
fellow
with
a
good
    
upper
lip
,
reading
law
 
have
get
some
room
in
town
now
not
far
off
us
,
    
and
have
have
a
neat
sister
(
upper
lip
also
good
)
stay
with
him
<EOS>
the
    
last
fortnight
.
<EOS>
I
have
introduce
them
both
to
my
mother
and
the
    
girl
,
who
have
find
out
from
Miss
Gascoigne
that
she
be
cousin
to
    
your
Vandyke
duchess
!
!
!
<EOS>
I
put
the
note
of
exclamation
to
mark
the
    
surprise
that
the
information
at
first
produce
on
my
feeble
    
understanding
.
<EOS>
on
reflection
I
discover
that
there
be
not
the
least
    
ground
for
surprise
,
unless
I
have
beforehand
believe
that
nobody
    
could
be
anybody
's
cousin
without
my
know
it
.
<EOS>
this
sort
of
    
surprise
,
I
take
it
,
depend
on
a
liveliness
of
the
spine
,
with
a
more
    
or
less
constant
nullity
of
brain
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
fellow
I
use
to
meet
    
at
Rome
who
be
in
an
effervescence
of
surprise
at
contact
with
the
    
simplest
information
.
<EOS>
tell
him
what
you
would
 
that
you
be
fond
of
    
easy
boot
 
<EOS>
he
would
always
say
,
"
no
!
be
you
?
"
<EOS>
with
the
same
energy
    
of
wonder
:
the
very
fellow
of
whom
pastoral
Browne
write
    
prophetically
          
"
a
wretch
so
empty
that
if
e'er
there
be
      
<EOS>
in
nature
find
the
least
vacuity
      
<EOS>
'
Twill
be
in
him
.
"
      
<EOS>
I
have
account
for
it
all
 
he
have
a
lively
spine
.
      
<EOS>
however
,
this
cousinship
with
the
duchess
come
out
by
chance
one
day
    
that
Mirah
be
with
them
at
home
<EOS>
and
they
be
talk
about
the
    
Mallingers
.
<EOS>
_
Apropos
_
;
I
be
get
so
important
that
I
have
    
rival
invitation
.
<EOS>
Gascoigne
want
me
to
go
down
with
him
to
his
    
father
's
rectory
in
August
and
see
the
country
round
there
.
<EOS>
but
I
    
think
self
-
interest
well
understand
will
take
me
to
Topping
Abbey
,
for
    
Sir
Hugo
have
invite
me
,
and
propose
 
God
bless
him
for
his
rashness
!
      
<EOS>
that
I
should
make
a
picture
of
his
three
daughter
sit
on
a
    
bank
 
as
he
say
,
in
the
Gainsborough
style
.
<EOS>
He
come
to
my
studio
the
    
other
day
and
recommend
me
to
apply
myself
to
portrait
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
    
know
what
that
mean
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
good
fellow
,
your
attempt
at
the
historic

it

<EOS>
your

will
never

<EOS>
what
great
effort
it
evidently
cost
our
friend
to
give
us
these
    
candid
opinion
!
<EOS>
I
have
even
know
a
man
to
take
the
trouble
to
call
,
    
in
order
to
tell
me
that
I
have
irretrievably
expose

that
if

we
would
    
have
lend

<EOS>
such
be
my
ingratitude

my
    
readiness
at
composition
,
that
even
while
he
be
speak
I
inwardly
    
sketch
a
last
judgment
with
that
candid
friend
's
physiognomy
on
the
    
leave
.
<EOS>
but
all
this
be
away
from
Sir
Hugo
,
whose
manner
of
imply
    
that
one
's
gift
be
not
of
the
high
order
<EOS>
be
so
exceedingly
    
good
-
natured
and
comfortable
that
I
begin
to
feel
it
an
advantage
not
    
to
be
among
those
poor
fellow
at
the
tip
-
top
.
<EOS>
and
his
kindness
to
me
    
taste
all
the
well
because
it
come
out
of
his
love
for
you
,
old
    
boy

<EOS>
His
chat
be
uncommonly
amusing
.
<EOS>
by
the
way
,
he
tell
me
that
your
    
Vandyke
duchess
be
go
with
her
husband
yacht
to
the
Mediterranean
.
    
<EOS>
I
bethink
me
that
it
be
possible
to
land
from
a
yacht
,
or
to
be
take
    
on
to
a
yacht
from
the

<EOS>
Shall
you
by
chance
have
an
opportunity
of
    
continue
your
theological
discussion
with
<EOS>
the
fair
Supralapsarian
 
I
    
think
you
say
her
tenet
be
of
that
complexion
?
<EOS>
be
Duke
Alphonso
    
also
theological

<EOS>
perhaps
an
Arian

object
to
triplicity

while
D.

read

a
profound
scorn
gather
in
his
face
    
till
at
the
last
word
he
fling
down
the
letter
,
grasp
his
coat

collar
    
in
a
statuesque
attitude

so
remain
with
a
look
generally
    
tremendous

<EOS>
Excuse
the
brevity
of
this
letter
.
<EOS>
You
be
not
use
to
more
from
me
    
than
a
bare
statement
of
fact
,
without
comment
or
digression
.
<EOS>
one
    
fact
I
have
omit
 
that
the
Klesmers
on
the
eve
of
departure
have
    
behave
magnificently
,
shine
forth
as
may
be
expect
from
the
    
planet
of
genius
and
fortune
in
conjunction
.
<EOS>
Mirah
be
rich
with
their
    
oriental
gift
.
      
<EOS>
what
luck
it
will
be
if
you
come
back
and
present
yourself
at
the
    
Abbey
while
I
be
there
!
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
behave
with
consummate
    
discretion
and
win
golden
opinion
,
but
I
shall
run
up
to
town
now
and
    
then
,
just
for
a
peep
into
Gad
Eden
.
<EOS>
You
see
how
far
I
have
get
in
    
<EOS>
Hebrew
lore
 
<EOS>
up
with
my
Lord
Bolingbroke
,
who
know
no
Hebrew
,
but
    
"
understand
that
sort
of
learning
and
what
be
writ
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
if
Mirah
    
command
,
I
would
go
to
a
depth
below
the
tri
-
literal
root
.
<EOS>
already
    
it
make
no
difference
to
me
whether
the
point
be
there
or
not
.
<EOS>
but
    
while
her
brother
's
life
last
I
suspect
she
would
not
listen
to
a
    
lover
,
even
one
whose
"
hair
be
like
a
flock
of
goat
on
Mount
    
Gilead
"
 
<EOS>
and
I
flatter
myself
that
few
head
would
bear
that
try
    
comparison
better
than
mine
.
<EOS>
so
I
stay
with
my
hope
among
the
    
orchard

<EOS>
Your
devoted
,
      
HANS
MEYRICK
.
  
<EOS>
some
month
before
,
this
letter
from
Hans
would
have
divide
Deronda
's
thought
irritatingly
:
<EOS>
its
romancing
,
about
Mirah
would
have
have
an
unpleasant
edge
,
scarcely
anoint
with
any
commiseration
for
his
friend
's
probable
disappointment
.
<EOS>
but
thing
have
alter
since
March
.
<EOS>
Mirah
be
no
longer
so
critically
place
with
regard
to
the
meyrick
,
and
Deronda
's
own
position
have
be
undergo
a
change
which
have
just
be
crown
by
the
revelation
of
his
birth
.
<EOS>
the
new
opening
toward
the
future
,
though
he
would
not
trust
in
any
definite
vision
,
inevitably
shed
new
light
,
and
influence
his
mood
toward
past
and
present
;
hence
,
what
Hans
call
his
hope
now
seem
to
Deronda
,
not
a
mischievous
unreasonableness
which
rouse
his
indignation
,
but
an
unusually
persistent
bird
-
dance
of
an
extravagant
fancy
,
and
he
would
have
feel
quite
able
to
pity
any
consequent
suffering
of
his
friend
's
,
if
he
have
believe
in
the
suffering
as
probable
.
<EOS>
but
some
of
the
busy
think
filling
that
long
day
,
which
pass
without
his
receive
any
new
summon
from
his
mother
,
be
give
to
the
argument
that
Hans
Meyrick
's
nature
be
not
one
in
which
love
could
strike
the
deep
root
that
turn
disappointment
into
sorrow
:
it
be
too
restless
,
too
readily
excitable
by
novelty
,
too
ready
to
turn
itself
into
imaginative
material
,
and
wear
its
grief
as
a
fantastic
costume
.
"
<EOS>
already
he
be
begin
to
play
at
love
:
he
be
take
the
whole
affair
as
a
comedy
,
"
say
Deronda
to
himself
;
"
he
know
very
well
that
there
be
no
chance
for
him
.
<EOS>
just
like
him
 
never
open
his
eye
on
any
possible
objection
I
could
have
to
receive
his
outpouring
about
Mirah
.
<EOS>
poor
old
Hans
!
<EOS>
if
we
be
under
a
fiery
hail
together
he
would
howl
like
a
Greek
,
and
if
I
do
not
howl
too
<EOS>
it
would
never
occur
to
him
that
I
be
as
badly
off
as
he
.
<EOS>
and
yet
he
be
tender
-
hearted
and
affectionate
in
intention
,
and
I
can
not
say
that
he
be
not
active
in
imagine
what
go
on
in
other
people
 
<EOS>
but
then
he
always
imagine
it
to
fit
his
own
inclination
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
this
touch
of
causticity
Deronda
get
rid
of
the
slight
heat
at
present
raise
by
Hans
's
naive
expansiveness
.
<EOS>
the
nonsense
about
Gwendolen
,
convey
the
fact
that
she
be
go
yacht
with
her
husband
,
only
suggest
a
disturbing
sequel
to
his
own
strange
parting
with
her
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
one
sentence
in
the
letter
which
raise
a
more
immediate
,
active
anxiety
.
<EOS>
Hans
's
suspicion
of
a
hide
sadness
in
Mirah
be
not
in
the
direction
of
his
wish
,
and
hence
,
instead
of
distrust
his
observation
here
,
Deronda
begin
to
conceive
a
cause
for
the
sadness
.
<EOS>
be
it
some
event
that
have
occur
during
his
absence
,
or
only
the
grow
fear
of
some
event
?
<EOS>
be
it
something
,
perhaps
alterable
,
in
the
new
position
which
have
be
make
for
her
?
<EOS>
or
 
have
Mordecai
,
against
his
habitual
resolve
,
communicate
to
her
those
peculiar
cherish
hope
about
him
,
Deronda
,
and
have
her
quickly
sensitive
nature
be
hurt
by
the
discovery
that
her
brother
's
will
or
tenacity
of
visionary
conviction
have
act
coercively
on
their
friendship
 
be
hurt
by
the
fear
that
there
be
more
of
pity
self
-
suppression
than
of
equal
regard
in
Deronda
's
relation
to
him
?
<EOS>
for
amidst
all
Mirah
's
quiet
renunciation
,
the
evident
thirst
of
soul
with
which
she
receive
the
tribute
of
equality
imply
a
corresponding
pain
if
she
find
that
what
she
have
take
for
a
purely
reverential
regard
toward
her
brother
have
its
mixture
of
condescension
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
last
conjecture
of
Deronda
's
he
be
not
wrong
as
to
the
quality
in
Mirah
's
nature
on
which
he
be
found
 
the
latent
protest
against
the
treatment
she
have
all
her
life
be
subject
to
until
she
meet
him
.
<EOS>
for
that
gratitude
which
would
not
let
her
pass
by
any
notice
of
their
acquaintance
without
insist
on
the
depth
of
her
debt
to
him
,
take
half
its
fervor
from
the
keen
comparison
with
what
other
have
think
enough
to
render
to
her
.
<EOS>
Deronda
's
affinity
in
feel
enable
him
to
penetrate
such
secret
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
not
near
the
truth
in
admit
the
idea
that
Mordecai
have
break
his
characteristic
reticence
.
<EOS>
to
no
soul
<EOS>
but
Deronda
himself
have
he
yet
breathe
the
history
of
their
relation
to
each
other
,
or
his
confidence
about
his
friend
's
origin
:
it
be
not
only
that
these
subject
be
for
him
too
sacred
to
be
speak
of
without
weighty
reason
,
but
that
he
have
discern
Deronda
's
shrinking
at
any
mention
of
his
birth
;
and
the
severity
of
reserve
which
have
hinder
Mordecai
from
answer
a
question
on
a
private
affair
of
the
Cohen
family
tell
yet
more
strongly
here
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ezra
,
how
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
Mirah
one
day
say
to
him
 
"
I
be
continually
go
to
speak
to
Mr.
Deronda
as
if
he
be
a
Jew
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
smile
at
her
quietly
,
and
say
,
"
I
suppose
it
be
because
he
treat
us
as
if
he
be
our
brother
.
<EOS>
but
he
love
not
to
have
the
difference
of
birth
dwelt
upon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
never
live
with
his
parent
,
Mr.
Hans
,
say
,
"
continue
Mirah
,
to
whom
this
be
necessarily
a
question
of
interest
about
every
one
for
whom
she
have
a
regard
.
  
<EOS>
"
seek
not
to
know
such
thing
from
Mr.
Hans
,
"
say
Mordecai
,
gravely
,
lay
his
hand
on
her
curl
,
as
he
be
will
not
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
Daniel
Deronda
wish
us
to
know
about
himself
be
for
him
to
tell
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
Mirah
feel
herself
rebuke
,
as
Deronda
have
do
.
<EOS>
but
to
be
rebuke
in
this
way
by
Mordecai
make
her
rather
proud
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
no
one
so
great
as
my
brother
,
"
she
say
to
Mrs.
Meyrick
one
day
that
she
call
at
the
Chelsea
house
on
her
way
home
,
and
,
accord
to
her
hope
,
find
the
little
mother
alone
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
difficult
to
think
that
he
belong
to
the
same
world
as
those
people
I
use
to
live
amongst
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
once
that
they
make
life
seem
like
a
madhouse
;
but
when
I
be
with
Ezra
he
make
me
feel
that
his
life
be
a
great
good
,
though
he
have
suffer
so
much
;
not
like
me
,
who
want
to
die
because
I
have
suffer
a
little
,
and
only
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
His
soul
be
so
full
,
it
be
impossible
for
him
to
wish
for
death
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
get
the
same
sort
of
feeling
from
him
that
I
get
yesterday
,
when
I
be
tired
,
and
come
home
through
the
park
after
the
sweet
rain
have
fall
and
the
sunshine
lie
on
the
grass
and
flower
.
<EOS>
everything
in
the
sky
and
under
the
sky
look
so
pure
and
beautiful
that
the
weariness
and
trouble
and
folly
seem
only
a
small
part
of
what
be
,
and
I
become
more
patient
and
hopeful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
a
dove
-
like
note
of
melancholy
in
this
speech
cause
Mrs.
Meyrick
to
look
at
Mirah
with
new
examination
.
<EOS>
after
lay
down
her
hat
and
push
her
curl
flat
,
with
an
air
of
fatigue
,
she
place
herself
on
a
chair
opposite
her
friend
in
her
habitual
attitude
,
her
foot
and
hand
just
cross
;
and
at
a
distance
she
may
have
seem
a
colored
statue
of
serenity
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Meyrick
discern
a
new
look
of
suppress
suffering
in
her
face
,
which
correspond
to
the
hint
that
to
be
patient
and
hopeful
require
some
extra
influence
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
there
any
fresh
trouble
on
your
mind
,
my
dear
?
"
say
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
give
up
her
needlework
as
a
sign
of
concentrated
attention
.
  
<EOS>
Mirah
hesitate
before
she
say
,
"
I
be
too
ready
to
speak
of
trouble
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
It
seem
unkind
to
put
anything
painful
into
other
people
's
mind
,
unless
one
be
sure
it
would
hinder
something
bad
.
<EOS>

perhaps
I
be
too
hasty
and
fearful
.

<EOS>
"
oh
,
my
dear
,
mother
be
make
to
like
pain
and
trouble
for
the
sake
of
their
child

be
it
because
the
singing
lesson
be
so
few
,
and
be
likely
to
fall
off
when
the
season
come
to
an
end
?
<EOS>
success
in
these
thing
can
not
come
all
at
once
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
do
not
believe
that
she
be
touch
the
real
grief
;
but
a
guess
that
could
be
correct
would
make
an
easy
channel
for
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
not
that
,
"
say
Mirah
,
shake
her
head
gently
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
a
little
disappointed
because
so
many
lady
say
they
want
me
to
give
them

<EOS>
their
daughter
lesson
,
and
<EOS>
then
I
never
hear
of
them
again

perhaps
after
the
holiday
I
shall
teach
in
some
school
.
<EOS>
besides
,
you
know
,
I
be
as
rich
as
a
princess
now

<EOS>
I
have
not
touch
the
hundred
pound
that
Mrs.
Klesmer
give
me
;
and
I
should
never
be
afraid
that
Ezra
would
be
in
want
of
anything

there
be
Mr.

,
"
It
be
the
chief
honor

my
life

share
anything

oh

no

Ezra

not

evil

anxiety
be
good
for
nothing

it

He
have
already
be
much
alter
and
wear
in
the
time
before
I
leave
him
.
<EOS>
You
remember
I
say
how
he
use
sometimes
to
cry
.
<EOS>
He
be
always
excited
one
way
or
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
have
tell
Ezra
everything
that
I
tell
you
,
and
he
say
that
my
father
have
take
to
gambling
,
which
make
people
easily
distress
,
and
then
again
exalt
.

and
now
 
it
be
only
a
moment
that
I
see
him
 
his
face
be
more
haggard
,
and
his
clothe
be
shabby

<EOS>
He
be
with
a
much
worse
-
looking
man

who
carry
something

they

hurry
along
after
an
omnibus

well

no

I
have
just
come
from
Mrs.
Raymond

I
be
wait
to
cross
near
the
Marble
Arch

<EOS>
soon
he
be
on
the
omnibus

go
out
of
sight

<EOS>
It
be
a
dreadful
moment

<EOS>
My
old
life
seem
to
have
come
back
again
,
and
it
be
bad
than
it
have
ever
be
before

I
could
not

a
new
deliverance
that
he

go
out

without

I

and
yet
it
hurt
me
that
I
be
feel
<EOS>
so
 
it
seem
hateful
in
me
 
almost
like
word
I
once
have
to
speak
in
a
play

that
"
I
have
warm
my
hand
in
the
blood
of
my

for
where
may
my

go
?

what
may
become

his

a

would
own
him

be
there
any

what
ought

turn
into
the
bad

<EOS>
all
those
opposite
feeling
be
meet
and
press
against
each

and
take
up
all
my
strength

<EOS>
no
one
could
act
that
.
<EOS>
acting
be
slow
and
poor
to
what
we
go
through
within
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
I
call
a
cab
.
<EOS>
I
only
remember
that
I
be
in
it
when
I
begin
to
think
,
"
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
Ezra
;
he
must
not
know
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
be
afraid
of
grieve
him
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
ask
,
when
Mirah
have
pause
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
something
more
,
"
say
Mirah
,
hesitatingly
,
as
if
she
be
examine
her
feeling
before
she
would
venture
to
speak
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
tell
you
;
I
can
not
tell
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
tell
my
own
mother
:
I
should
have
close
it
up
before
her
.
<EOS>
I
feel
shame
for
my
father
,
and
it
be
perhaps
strange
 
<EOS>
but
the
shame
be
great
before
Ezra
than
before
any
one
else
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
He
desire
me
to
tell
him
all
about
my
life
,
and
I
obey
him
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
always
like
a
smart
to
me
to
know
that
those
thing
about
my
father
be
in
Ezra
's
mind
.
<EOS>
and
 
can
you
believe
it
?
<EOS>
when
the
thought
haunt
me
how
it
would
be
if
my
father
be
to
come
and
show
himself
before
us
both
,
what
seem
as
if
it
would
scorch
me
most
be
see
my
father
shrink
before
Ezra
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
truth
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
it
be
a
right
feeling
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
help
think
that
I
would
rather
try
to
maintain
my
father
in
secret
,
and
bear
a
great
deal
in
that
way
,
if
I
could
hinder
him
from
meet
my
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
encourage
that
feeling
,
Mirah
,
"
say
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
very
dangerous
;
it
would
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
have
concealment
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
ought
I
now
to
tell
Ezra
that
I
have
see
my
father
?
"
say
Mirah
,
with
deprecation
in
her
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
Mrs.
Meyrick
answer
,
dubitatively
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
it
be
necessary
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
Your
father
may
go
away
with
the
bird
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
clear
that
he
come
after
you
;
you
may
never
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
and
then
your
brother
will
have
be
spare
a
useless
anxiety
.
<EOS>
but
promise
me
that
if
your
father
see
you
 
get
hold
of
you
in
any
way
again
 
<EOS>
and
you
will
let
us
all
know
.
<EOS>
promise
me
that
solemnly
,
Mirah
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
right
to
ask
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
reflect
a
little
,
then
lean
forward
to
put
her
hand
in
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
,
and
say
,
"
since
you
ask
it
,
I
do
promise
.
<EOS>
I
will
bear
this
feeling
of
shame
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
so
long
use
to
think
that
I
must
bear
that
sort
of
inward
pain
.
<EOS>
but
the
shame
for
my
father
burn
me
more
when
I
think
of
his
meeting
Ezra
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
silent
a
moment
or
two
,
and
then
say
,
in
a
new
tone
of
yearn
compassion
,
"
<EOS>
and
we
be
his
child
 
<EOS>
and
he
be
once
young
like
us
 
and
<EOS>
my
mother
love
him
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
see
it
all
close
,
and
it
hurt
me
like
a
cruelty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
shed
no
tear
<EOS>
:
the
discipline
of
her
whole
life
have
be
against
indulgence
in
such
manifestation
,
which
soon
fall
under
the
control
of
strong
motive
;
but
it
seem
that
the
more
intense
expression
of
sorrow
have
enter
into
her
voice
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
with
all
her
quickness
and
love
insight
,
do
not
quite
understand
that
filial
feeling
in
Mirah
which
have
active
root
deep
below
her
indignation
for
the
bad
offense
.
<EOS>
She
could
conceive
that
a
mother
would
have
a
cling
pity
and
shame
for
a
reprobate
son
,
but
she
be
out
of
patience
with
what
she
hold
an
exaggerated
susceptibility
on
behalf
of
this
father
,
whose
reappearance
incline
her
to
wish
him
under
the
care
of
a
turnkey
.
<EOS>
Mirah
's
promise
,
however
,
be
some
security
against
her
weakness
.
  
<EOS>
that
incident
be
the
only
reason
that
Mirah
herself
could
have
state
for
the
hide
sadness
which
Hans
have
divine
.
<EOS>
of
one
element
in
her
changed
mood
she
could
have
give
no
definite
account
:
it
be
something
as
dim
as
the
sense
of
approach
weather
-
change
,
and
have
extremely
slight
external
prompting
,
such
as
we
be
often
ashamed
to
find
all
we
can
allege
in
support
of
the
busy
construction
that
go
on
within
us
,
not
only
without
effort
,
but
even
against
it
,
under
the
influence
of
any
blind
emotional
stirring
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
first
leaven
of
uneasiness
be
lay
by
Gwendolen
's
behavior
on
that
visit
which
be
entirely
superfluous
as
a
means
of
engage
Mirah
to
sing
,
and
could
have
no
other
motive
than
the
excited
and
strange
questioning
about
Deronda
.
<EOS>
Mirah
have
instinctively
keep
the
visit
a
secret
,
but
the
active
remembrance
of
it
have
raise
a
new
susceptibility
in
her
,
and
make
her
alive
as
she
have
never
be
before
to
the
relation
Deronda
must
have
with
that
society
which
she
herself
be
get
frequent
glimpse
of
without
belong
to
it
.
<EOS>
Her
peculiar
life
and
education
have
produce
in
her
an
extraordinary
mixture
of
unworldliness
,
with
knowledge
of
the
world
's
evil
,
and
even
this
knowledge
be
a
strange
blending
of
direct
observation
with
the
effect
of
reading
and
theatrical
study
.
<EOS>
Her
memory
be
furnish
with
abundant
passionate
situation
and
intrigue
,
which
she
never
make
emotionally
her
own
,
but
feel
a
repelled
aloofness
from
,
as
she
have
do
from
the
actual
life
around
her
.
<EOS>
some
of
that
imaginative
knowledge
begin
now
to
weave
itself
around
Mrs.
Grandcourt
;
and
though
Mirah
would
admit
no
position
likely
to
affect
her
reverence
for
Deronda
,
she
could
not
avoid
a
new
painfully
vivid
association
of
his
general
life
with
a
world
away
from
her
own
,
where
there
may
be
some
involvement
of
his
feeling
and
action
with
a
woman
like
Gwendolen
,
who
be
increasingly
repugnant
to
her
 
increasingly
,
even
after
she
have
cease
to
see
her
;
for
liking
and
disliking
can
grow
in
meditation
as
fast
as
in
the
more
immediate
kind
of
presence
.
<EOS>
any
disquietude
consciously
due
to
the
idea
that
Deronda
's
deep
care
may
be
for
something
remote
not
only
from
herself
but
even
from
his
friendship
for
her
brother
<EOS>
,
she
would
have
check
with
rebuke
question
:
 
<EOS>
what
be
she
but
one
who
have
share
his
generous
kindness
with
many
other
?
<EOS>
and
his
attachment
to
her
brother
,
be
it
not
begin
late
to
be
soon
end
?
<EOS>
other
tie
have
come
before
,
and
other
would
remain
after
this
have
be
cut
by
swift
-
come
death
.
<EOS>
but
her
uneasiness
have
not
reach
that
point
of
self
-
recognition
in
which
she
would
have
be
ashamed
of
it
as
an
indirect
,
presumptuous
claim
on
Deronda
's
feeling
.
<EOS>
that
she
or
any
one
else
should
think
of
him
as
her
possible
lover
be
a
conception
which
have
never
enter
her
mind
;
indeed
it
be
equally
out
of
the
question
with
Mrs.
Meyrick
and
the
girl
,
who
with
Mirah
herself
regard
his
intervention
in
her
life
as
something
exceptional
,
and
be
so
impressed
by
his
mission
as
her
deliverer
and
guardian
that
they
would
have
hold
it
an
offense
to
him
at
his
hold
any
other
relation
toward
her
:
<EOS>
a
point
of
view
which
Hans
also
have
readily
adopt
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
little
hard
upon
some
man
that
they
appear
to
sink
for
us
in
become
lover
.
<EOS>
but
precisely
to
this
innocence
of
the
meyrick
be
owe
the
disturbance
of
Mirah
's
unconsciousness
.
<EOS>
the
first
occasion
could
hardly
have
be
more
trivial
,
but
it
prepare
her
emotive
nature
for
a
deep
effect
from
what
happen
afterward
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
when
Anna
Gascoigne
,
visit
the
meyrick
;
be
lead
to
speak
of
her
cousinship
with
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
the
visit
have
be
arrange
that
Anna
may
see
Mirah
;
the
three
girl
be
at
home
with
their
mother
,
and
there
be
naturally
a
flux
of
talk
among
six
feminine
creature
,
free
from
the
presence
of
a
distort
male
standard
.
<EOS>
Anna
Gascoigne
feel
herself
much
at
home
with
the
meyrick
girl
,
who
know
what
it
be
to
have
a
brother
,
and
to
be
generally
regard
as
of
minor
importance
in
the
world
;
and
she
have
tell
Rex
that
she
think
the
University
very
nice
,
because
brother
make
friend
there
whose
family
be
not
rich
and
grand
,
and
yet
(
like
the
University
)
be
very
nice
.
<EOS>
the
meyrick
seem
to
her
almost
alarmingly
clever
,
and
she
consult
them
much
on
the
good
mode
of
teach
Lotta
,
confide
to
them
that
she
herself
be
the
least
clever
of
her
family
.
<EOS>
Mirah
have
lately
come
in
,
and
there
be
a
complete
bouquet
of
young
face
around
the
tea
-
table
 
Hafiz
,
seat
a
little
aloft
with
large
eye
on
the
alert
,
regard
the
whole
scene
as
an
apparatus
for
supply
his
allowance
of
milk
.
  
<EOS>
"
think
of
our
surprise
,
Mirah
,
"
say
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
speak
of
Mr.
Deronda

the
Mallingers

it
turn
out
that
Miss
Gascoigne

them

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
know
about
them
,
"
say
Anna
,
a
little
flush
with
excitement
,
what
she
have
hear
and
now
see
of
the
lovely
Jewess
be
an
almost
startling
novelty
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
even
see
them

<EOS>
but
some
month
ago
,
my
cousin

Sir

Mallinger

Mr.

Mab

clasp
her

something

yes

<EOS>
Her
mamma

mine

<EOS>
My
aunt
be
much
rich
before
last
year
,
but
then
she
and
mamma
lose
all
their
fortune
.
<EOS>
papa
be
a
clergyman
,
you
know

so
it
make
very
little
difference
to
us
,
except
that
we
keep
no
carriage
,
and
have
no
dinner
party
 
<EOS>
and
I
like
it
better

<EOS>
but
it
be
very
sad
for
poor
Aunt
Davilow
,
for
she
could
not
live
with
us
,
because
she
have
four
daughter
besides
Gwendolen

but
then
,
when
she
marry
Mr.

it
do
not

so
much

because
of
his
be
so
rich

this

.
<EOS>
We
talk
a
great
deal
about
every
one
who
come
near
Pennicote
,
because
it
be
so
seldom
there
be
any
one
new
.
<EOS>
but
I
remember
,
when
I
ask
Gwendolen
what
she
think
of
Mr.
Deronda
,
she
say
,
"
do
not
mention
it
,
Anna
:
but
I
think
his
hair
be
dark
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
her
droll
way
of
answering
:
she
be
always
so
lively
.
<EOS>
It
be
really
rather
wonderful
that
I
should
come
to
hear
so
much
about
him
,
all
through
Mr.
Hans
know
Rex
,
and
then
my
have
the
pleasure
of
know
you
,
"
Anna
end
,
look
at
Mrs.
Meyrick
with
a
shy
grace
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
pleasure
be
on
our
side
too
;
but
the
wonder
would
have
be
,
if
you
have
come
to
this
house
without
hearing
of
Mr.
Deronda
 
<EOS>
would
not
it
,
Mirah
?
"
say
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
  
<EOS>
Mirah
smile
acquiescently
,
but
have
nothing
to
say
.
<EOS>
a
confused
discontent
take
possession
of
her
at
the
mingling
of
name
and
image
to
which
she
have
be
listen
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
son
call
Mrs.
Grandcourt

Vandyke
duchess

continue
Mrs.
Meyrick

again
to

her
so
striking

picturesque

Gwendolen

dreadfully

it
a

it
make
them
unhappy

<EOS>
"
and
how
do
you
like
Mr.

the
happy
lover

Mrs.

,
who
,
in
her
way
,
be
as
much
interested
as
Mab
in
the
hint
she
have
be
hear
of
vicissitude
in
the
life
of
a
widow

"
papa
approve
of

him

my
aunt

he
be
very
generous

Anna

with
a
virtuous
intention

repress
her

sentiment

then
,
unable
to
resist
a
rare
occasion

speak
them
freely

she
go
on

else
<EOS>
I
should
have
think
he
be
not
very
nice
 
<EOS>
rather
proud
,
and
not
at
all
lively
,
like
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
think
some
one
young
and
more
lively
would
have
suit
her
well
.
<EOS>
but
,
perhaps
,
have
a
brother
who
seem
to
us
better

any

bad
of

off

you

you
can
always

something
descriptive

what
do

you
_
think
of
Mrs.

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I

in

Don

Mirah

with
a
quick
intensity
.
<EOS>
She
be
pursue
an
association
in
her
own
mind
not
intelligible
to
her
hearer
 
<EOS>
an
association
with
a
certain
actress
as
well
as
the
part
she
represent

<EOS>
"
Your
comparison
be
a
riddle
for

You

continue
Mirah
,
slightly
paler

that
be
quite
true
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
quick
eye
and
ear
detect
something
unusual
,
but
immediately
explain
it
to
herself
.
<EOS>
fine
lady
have
often
wound
Mirah
by
caprice
of
manner
and
intention
.

Mrs.

have
think
of

lesson

to
Anna

many
have
talk
of
have
lesson

then
have
find
no
time
.
<EOS>
fashionable
lady
have
too
much
work
to
do

"
  
<EOS>
and
the
chat
go
on
without
further
insistance
on
the
_
Princess

_
.
<EOS>
that
comparison
escape
Mirah
's
lip
under
the
urgency
of
a
pang
unlike
anything
she
have
feel
before
.
<EOS>
the
conversation
from
the
beginning
have
revive
unpleasant
impression
,
and
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
suggestion
of
Gwendolen
's
figure
by
the
side
of
Deronda
's
have
the
stinging
effect
of
a
voice
outside
her
,
confirm
her
secret
conviction
that
this
tall
and
fair
woman
have
some
hold
on
his
lot
.
<EOS>
for
a
long
while
afterward
she
feel
as
if
she
have
have
a
jarring
shock
through
her
frame

<EOS>
in
the
evening
,
put
her
cheek
against
her
brother

shoulder
as
she
be
sit
by
him
,
while
he
sit
prop
up
in
bed
under
a
new
difficulty
of
breathing
,
she
say
    
"
Ezra
,
do
it
ever
hurt
your

that
so
much
of

be
all

away
from
you
 
that
he
be
amongst
person

care
about

<EOS>
"
no

assuredly
no

"
say
Mordecai

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
rather
it
be
a
precious
thought
to
me
that
he
have
a
preparation
which
I
lack

and
be
an
accomplish
Egyptian

"
<EOS>
then
,
recollect
that
his
word
have
reference
which
his

must
not
yet
understand

he
add
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
the
more
to

since
his

be

"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
muse
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
still
,
"
she
say
,
"
it
would
be
a
trial
to
your
love

him

that
other
part

be
like
a
crowd
in
which
he
have
get
entangle

so
that
he
be
carry
away
from
you
 
<EOS>
I
mean
in
his
thought
,
and
not
merely
carry
out
of
sight
as
he
be
now

not
merely
for
a
little
while
,
but
continually
.
<EOS>
how
should
you
bear
that
!
<EOS>
Our
religion
command
us
to
bear

<EOS>
but
how
should
you
bear
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
well
,
my
sister
 
<EOS>
not
well
;
but
it
will
never
happen
,
"
say
Mordecai
,
look
at
her
with
a
tender
smile
.
<EOS>
He
think
that
her
heart
need
comfort
on
his
account
.
  
<EOS>
Mirah
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
She
muse
over
the
difference
between
her
own
state
of
mind
and
her
brother
's
,
and
feel
her
comparative
pettiness
.
<EOS>
why
could
she
not
be
completely
satisfied
with
what
satisfy
his
large
judgment
?
<EOS>
She
give
herself
no
full
reason
than
a
painful
sense
of
unfitness
 
in
what
?
<EOS>
airy
possibility
to
which
she
could
give
no
outline
,
but
to
which
one
name
and
one
figure
give
the
wander
persistency
of
a
blot
in
her
vision
.
<EOS>
here
lay
the
vaguer
source
of
the
hide
sadness
render
noticeable
to
Hans
by
some
diminution
of
that
sweet
ease
,
that
ready
joyousness
of
response
in
her
speech
and
smile
,
which
have
come
with
the
new
sense
of
freedom
and
safety
,
and
have
make
her
presence
like
the
freshly
-
open
daisy
and
clear
bird
-
note
after
the
rain
.
<EOS>
She
herself
regard
her
uneasiness
as
a
sort
of
ingratitude
and
dullness
of
sensibility
toward
the
great
thing
that
have
be
give
her
in
her
new
life
;
and
whenever
she
throw
more
energy
than
usual
into
her
singing
,
it
be
the
energy
of
indignation
against
the
shallowness
of
her
own
content
.
<EOS>
in
that
mood
she
once
say
,
"
Shall
I
tell
you
what
be
the
difference
between
you

<EOS>
"
why

Mordecai

He
fall
into
this
antique
form
of
speech
habitually
in
talk
to
his
sister

to
the
Cohen

send

a

to

Her

more
impressive
in

sombre
light

eye

the
line
more
vigorous

You
may
have
imagine

seat
herself

It
seem
as
if

have
exhaust
her
emotion
in

former

the
fact

tenacity

tone

I
consider
it
my
duty

be
the
impulse

my
feeling

identify
myself

as
far
as
possible

with
my
hereditary
people

I
can

His
mother
have
her
eye
fix
on
him

a
wonder
speculation

his
face
as
if
she
think
that

He
bear
her
gaze
very
firmly
,
sustain
by
a
resolute
opposition

which
be
the
expression
of
his
full
self

She
bend
toward
him
a
little
,

touch

that
objection

to
those
who

certain
of
their
own

interpretation
to

besides
this

the
point

in
question
be
one
on

feel
a
repugnance

to
deny

I
will
admit

may

some
benefit

the
benefit

gratitude

she
shake

even
more
urgently

in
utter
these
last
sentence
the
Princess
narrow
her
eye

wave
her
head
up

down

and
speak
slowly
with

with

sudden
outburst

former
interview

she
add
more
slowly

Her
tone
be
abrupt

scornful

Deronda
,
in
his
pained
feeling
,
and
under
the
solemn
urgency
of
the
moment

have
to
keep
a
clutch
remembrance
of
their
relationship

lest
his
word
should
become
cruel

<EOS>
He
begin
in
a
deep
entreat
tone
:
  
"

Mother

We

no
wonder

to
reveal
themselves
in

the
effect
prepare
by

likely
to
triumph
over
a
contrivance
which
would
bend
them
all
to
the
satisfaction
of
self

<EOS>
Your
will
be
strong

but
my
grandfather
's
trust
which
you
accept
and
do
not
fulfill
 
what
you
call
his
yoke
 
be
the
expression
of
something
strong

with
deep
,
farther
-
spread
root
,
knit
into
the
foundation
of
sacredness
for
all

You
renounce
me

<EOS>
there
be
an
involuntary
movement
of
indignation
in

voice

Madonna
Pia

feel

injure
by

,
take
her
to
his
castle
amid
the
swampy
flat
of
the
Maremma
and
get
rid
of
her
there
,
make
a
pathetic
figure
in
Dante
's
Purgatory
,
among
the
sinner
who
repent
at
the
last
and
desire
to
be
remember
compassionately
by
their
fellow
-
countryman
.
<EOS>
We
know
little
about
the
ground
of
mutual
discontent
between
the
siennese
couple
,
but
we
may
infer
with
some
confidence
that
the
husband
have
never
be
a
very
delightful
companion
,
and
that
on
the
flat
of
the
Maremma
his
disagreeable
manner
have
a
background
which
throw
them
out
remarkably
;
whence
in
his
desire
to
punish
his
wife
to
the
unmost
,
<EOS>
the
nature
of
thing
be
so
far
against
him
that
in
relieve
himself
of
her
<EOS>
he
could
not
avoid
make
the
relief
mutual
.
<EOS>
and
thus
,
without
any
hardness
to
the
poor
Tuscan
lady
,
who
have
her
deliverance
long
ago
,
one
may
feel
warrant
in
thinking
of
her
with
a
less
sympathetic
interest
than
of
the
better
know
Gwendolen
who
,
instead
of
be
deliver
from
her
error
on
earth
and
cleanse
from
their
effect
in
purgatory
,
be
at
the
very
height
of
her
entanglement
in
those
fatal
mesh
which
be
weave
within
more
closely
than
without
,
and
often
make
the
inward
torture
disproportionate
to
what
be
discernable
as
outward
cause
.
  
<EOS>
in
take
his
wife
with
him
on
a
yacht
expedition
,
Grandcourt
have
no
intention
to
get
rid
of
her
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
want
to
feel
more
securely
that
she
be
his
to
do
as
he
like
with
,
and
to
make
her
feel
it
also
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
he
be
himself
very
fond
of
yachting
:
<EOS>
its
dreamy
do
-
nothing
absolutism
,
unmoleste
by
social
demand
,
suit
his
disposition
,
and
he
do
not
in
the
least
regard
it
as
an
equivalent
for
the
dreariness
of
the
Maremma
.
<EOS>
He
have
his
reason
for
carry
Gwendolen
out
of
reach
,
but
they
be
not
reason
that
can
seem
black
in
the
mere
statement
.
<EOS>
He
suspect
a
grow
spirit
of
opposition
in
her
,
and
his
feeling
about
the
sentimental
inclination
she
betray
for
Deronda
be
what
in
another
man
he
would
have
call
jealousy
.
<EOS>
in
himself
it
seem
merely
a
resolution
to
put
an
end
to
such
foolery
as
must
have
be
go
on
in
that
prearrange
visit
of
Deronda
's
which
he
have
divine
and
interrupt
.
  
<EOS>
and
Grandcourt
may
have
plead
that
he
be
perfectly
justify
in
take
care
that
his
wife
should
fulfill
the
obligation
she
have
accept
.
<EOS>
Her
marriage
be
a
contract
where
all
the
ostensible
advantage
be
on
her
side
,
and
it
be
only
of
those
advantage
that
her
husband
should
use
his
power
to
hinder
her
from
any
injurious
self
committal
or
unsuitable
behavior
.
<EOS>
He
know
quite
well
that
she
have
not
marry
him
 
have
not
overcome
her
repugnance
to
certain
fact
 
out
of
love
to
him
personally
;
he
have
win
her
by
the
rank
and
luxury
he
have
to
give
her
,
and
<EOS>
these
she
have
get
:
he
have
fulfil
his
side
of
the
contract
.
  
<EOS>
and
Gwendolen
,
we
know
,
be
thoroughly
aware
of
the
situation
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
excuse
herself
by
say
that
there
have
be
a
tacit
part
of
the
contract
on
her
side
 
namely
,
that
she
mean
to
rule
and
have
her
own
way
.
<EOS>
with
all
her
early
indulgence
in
the
disposition
to
dominate
,
she
be
not
one
of
the
narrow
-
brained
woman
who
through
life
regard
all
their
own
selfish
demand
as
right
,
and
every
claim
upon
themselves
as
an
injury
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
root
of
conscience
in
her
,
and
the
process
of
purgatory
have
begin
for
her
on
the
green
earth
:
she
know
that
she
have
be
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
enter
into
the
soul
of
this
young
creature
as
she
find
herself
,
with
the
blue
Mediterranean
divide
her
from
the
world
,
on
the
tiny
plank
-
island
of
a
yacht
,
the
domain
of
the
husband
to
whom
she
feel
that
she
have
sell
herself
,
and
have
be
pay
the
strict
price
 
nay
,
pay
more
than
she
have
dare
to
ask
in
the
handsome
maintenance
of
her
mother
:
 
the
husband
to
whom
she
have
sell
her
truthfulness
and
sense
of
justice
,
so
that
he
hold
them
throttle
into
silence
,
collar
and
drag
behind
him
to
witness
what
he
would
,
without
remonstrance
.
  
<EOS>
what
have
she
to
complain
of
?
<EOS>
the
yacht
be
of
the
prettiest
;
the
cabin
fit
up
to
perfection
,
smell
of
cedar
,
soft
-
cushion
,
hang
with
silk
,
expand
with
mirror
;
the
crew
such
as
suit
an
elegant
toy
,
one
of
them
have
even
ringlet
,
as
well
as
a
bronze
complexion
and
fine
tooth
;
and
Mr.
Lush
be
not
there
,
for
he
have
take
his
way
back
to
England
as
soon
as
he
have
see
all
and
everything
on
board
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
Gwendolen
herself
like
the
sea
:
it
do
not
make
her
ill
;
and
to
observe
the
rigging
of
the
vessel
and
forecast
the
necessary
adjustment
be
a
sort
of
amusement
that
may
have
gratify
her
activity
and
enjoyment
of
imaginary
rule
;
the
weather
be
fine
,
and
they
be
coast
southward
,
where
even
the
rain
-
furrow
,
heat
-
crack
clay
become
gem
-
like
with
purple
shadow
,
and
where
one
may
float
between
blue
and
blue
in
an
open
-
eyed
dream
that
the
world
have
do
with
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
but
what
can
still
that
hunger
of
the
heart
which
sicken
the
eye
for
beauty
,
and
make
sweet
-
scented
ease
an
oppression
?
<EOS>
what
sort
of
Moslem
paradise
would
quiet
the
terrible
fury
of
moral
repulsion
and
cow
resistance
which
,
like
an
eat
pain
intensify
into
torture
,
concentrate
the
mind
in
that
poisonous
misery
?
<EOS>
while
Gwendolen
,
throne
on
her
cushion
at
evening
,
and
behold
the
glory
of
sea
and
sky
soften
as
if
with
boundless
love
around
her
,
be
hope
that
Grandcourt
in
his
march
up
and
down
be
not
go
to
pause
near
her
,
not
go
to
look
at
her
or
speak
to
her
,
<EOS>
some
woman
,
under
a
smoky
sky
,
oblige
to
consider
the
price
of
egg
in
arrange
her
dinner
,
be
listen
for
the
music
of
a
footstep
that
would
remove
all
risk
from
her
foretaste
of
joy
;
some
couple
,
bend
cheek
by
cheek
,
over
a
bit
of
work
do
by
the
one
and
delight
in
by
the
other
,
be
reckon
the
earning
that
would
make
them
rich
enough
for
a
holiday
among
the
furze
and
heather
.
  
<EOS>
have
Grandcourt
the
least
conception
of
what
be
go
on
in
the
breast
of
his
wife
?
<EOS>
He
conceive
that
she
do
not
love
him
;
but
be
that
necessary
?
<EOS>
She
be
under
his
power
,
and
he
be
not
accustom
to
soothe
himself
,
as
some
cheerfully
-
dispose
person
be
,
with
the
conviction
that
he
be
very
generally
and
justly
beloved
.
<EOS>
but
what
lie
quite
away
from
his
conception
be
,
that
she
could
have
any
special
repulsion
for
him
personally
.
<EOS>
how
could
she
?
<EOS>
He
himself
know
what
personal
repulsion
be
 
nobody
better
;
his
mind
be
much
furnish
with
a
sense
of
what
brute
his
fellow
-
creature
be
,
both
masculine
and
feminine
;
what
odious
familiarity
they
have
,
what
smirk
,
what
mode
of
flourish
their
handkerchief
,
what
costume
,
what
lavender
water
,
<EOS>
what
bulge
eye
,
and
what
foolish
notion
of
make
themselves
agreeable
by
remark
which
be
not
want
.
<EOS>
in
this
critical
view
of
mankind
there
be
an
affinity
between
him
and
Gwendolen
before
their
marriage
,
and
we
know
that
she
have
be
attractingly
work
upon
by
the
refined
negation
he
present
to
her
.
<EOS>
hence
he
understand
her
repulsion
for
Lush
.
<EOS>
but
how
be
he
to
understand
or
conceive
her
present
repulsion
for
Henleigh
Grandcourt
?
<EOS>
some
man
bring
themselves
to
believe
,
and
not
merely
maintain
,
the
non
-
existence
of
an
external
world
;
a
few
other
believe
themselves
object
of
repulsion
to
a
woman
without
be
tell
so
in
plain
language
.
<EOS>
but
Grandcourt
do
not
belong
to
this
eccentric
body
of
thinker
.
<EOS>
He
have
all
his
life
have
reason
to
take
a
flattering
view
of
his
own
attractiveness
,
and
to
place
himself
in
fine
antithesis
to
the
man
who
,
he
see
at
once
,
must
be
revolt
to
a
woman
of
taste
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
idea
of
moral
repulsion
,
and
could
not
have
believe
,
if
he
have
be
tell
it
,
that
there
may
be
a
resentment
and
disgust
which
will
gradually
make
beauty
more
detestable
than
ugliness
,
through
exasperation
at
that
outward
virtue
in
which
hateful
thing
can
flaunt
themselves
or
find
a
supercilious
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
how
,
then
,
could
Grandcourt
divine
what
be
go
on
in
Gwendolen
's
breast
?
  
<EOS>
for
their
behavior
to
each
other
scandalize
no
observer
 
<EOS>
not
even
the
foreign
maid
,
warrant
against
sea
-
sickness
;
nor
Grandcourt
's
own
experienced
valet
:
still
less
the
picturesque
crew
,
who
regard
them
as
a
model
couple
in
high
life
.
<EOS>
Their
companionship
consist
chiefly
in
a
well
-
breed
silence
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
have
no
humorous
observation
at
which
Gwendolen
could
refuse
to
smile
,
no
chit
-
chat
to
make
small
occasion
of
dispute
.
<EOS>
He
be
perfectly
polite
in
arrange
an
additional
garment
over
her
when
needful
,
and
in
hand
her
any
object
that
he
perceive
her
to
need
,
and
she
could
not
fall
into
the
vulgarity
of
accept
or
reject
such
politeness
rudely
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
put
up
his
telescope
and
say
,
"
there
be
a
plantation
of
sugar
-
cane
at
the
foot
of
that
rock
;
should
you
like
to
look
?
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
say
,
"
yes
,
please
,
"
remember
that
she
must
try
and
interest
herself
in
sugar
-
cane
as
something
outside
her
personal
affair
.
<EOS>
then
Grandcourt
would
walk
up
and
down
and
smoke
for
a
long
while
,
pause
occasionally
to
point
out
a
sail
on
the
horizon
,
and
at
last
would
seat
himself
and
look
at
Gwendolen
with
his
narrow
immovable
gaze
,
as
if
she
be
part
of
the
complete
yacht
;
while
she
,
conscious
of
be
look
at
be
exert
her
ingenuity
not
to
meet
his
eye
.
<EOS>
at
dinner
he
would
remark
that
the
fruit
be
get
stale
,
and
they
must
put
in
somewhere
for
more
;
or
,
observe
that
she
do
not
drink
the
wine
,
he
ask
her
if
she
would
like
any
other
kind
better
.
<EOS>
a
lady
be
oblige
to
respond
to
these
thing
suitably
;
and
even
if
she
have
not
shrink
from
quarrel
on
other
ground
,
quarrel
with
Grandcourt
be
impossible
;
she
may
as
well
have
make
angry
remark
to
a
dangerous
serpent
ornamentally
coil
in
her
cabin
without
invitation
.
<EOS>
and
what
sort
of
dispute
could
a
woman
of
any
pride
and
dignity
begin
on
a
yacht
?
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
have
intense
satisfaction
in
lead
his
wife
captive
after
this
fashion
;
it
give
their
life
on
a
small
scale
a
royal
representation
and
publicity
in
which
every
thing
familiar
be
get
rid
of
,
and
every
body
must
do
what
be
expect
of
them
whatever
may
be
their
private
protest
 
<EOS>
the
protest
(
keep
strictly
private
)
add
to
the
piquancy
of
despotism
.
  
<EOS>
to
Gwendolen
,
who
even
in
the
freedom
of
her
maiden
time
,
have
have
very
faint
glimpse
of
any
heroism
or
sublimity
,
the
medium
that
now
thrust
itself
everywhere
before
her
view
be
this
husband
and
her
relation
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
being
close
to
us
,
whether
in
love
or
hate
,
be
often
virtually
our
interpreter
of
the
world
,
and
some
feather
-
head
gentleman
or
lady
whom
in
pass
we
regret
to
take
as
legal
tender
for
a
human
being
,
may
be
act
as
a
melancholy
theory
of
life
in
the
mind
of
those
who
live
with
them
 
like
a
piece
of
yellow
and
wavy
glass
that
distort
form
and
make
color
an
affliction
.
<EOS>
Their
trivial
sentence
,
their
petty
standard
,
their
low
suspicion
,
their
loveless
_
ennui
_
,
may
be
make
somebody
else
's
life
no
well
than
a
promenade
through
a
pantheon
of
ugly
idol
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
have
that
kind
of
window
before
her
,
affect
the
distant
equally
with
the
near
.
<EOS>
some
unhappy
wife
be
soothe
by
the
possibility
that
they
may
become
mother
;
but
Gwendolen
feel
that
to
desire
a
child
for
herself
would
have
be
a
consenting
to
the
completion
of
the
injury
she
have
be
guilty
of
.
<EOS>
She
be
reduce
to
dread
lest
she
should
become
a
mother
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
image
of
a
new
sweetly
-
bud
life
that
come
as
a
vision
of
deliverance
from
the
monotony
of
distaste
:
it
be
an
image
of
another
sort
.
<EOS>
in
the
irritable
,
fluctuate
stage
of
despair
,
gleam
of
hope
come
in
the
form
of
some
possible
accident
.
<EOS>
to
dwell
on
the
benignity
of
accident
be
a
refuge
from
bad
temptation
.
  
<EOS>
the
embitterment
of
hatred
be
often
as
unaccountable
to
onlooker
as
the
growth
of
devoted
love
,
and
it
not
only
seem
but
be
really
out
of
direct
relation
with
any
outward
cause
to
be
allege
.
<EOS>
passion
be
of
the
nature
of
seed
,
and
find
nourishment
within
,
tend
to
a
predominance
which
determine
all
current
toward
itself
,
and
make
the
whole
life
its
tributary
.
<EOS>
and
the
intense
form
of
hatred
be
that
root
in
fear
,
which
compel
to
silence
and
drive
vehemence
into
a
constructive
vindictiveness
,
an
imaginary
annihilation
of
the
detest
object
,
something
like
the
hide
rite
of
vengeance
with
which
the
persecute
have
make
a
dark
vent
for
their
rage
,
and
soothe
their
suffering
into
dumbness
.
<EOS>
such
hide
rite
go
on
in
the
secrecy
of
Gwendolen
's
mind
,
but
not
with
soothing
effect
 
rather
with
the
effect
of
a
struggle
terror
.
<EOS>
side
by
side
with
the
dread
of
her
husband
have
grow
the
self
-
dread
,
which
urge
her
to
flee
from
the
pursue
image
work
by
her
pen
-
up
impulse
.
<EOS>
the
vision
of
her
past
wrong
-
doing
,
and
what
it
have
bring
on
her
,
come
with
a
pale
ghastly
illumination
over
every
imagine
deed
that
be
a
rash
effort
at
freedom
,
such
as
she
have
make
in
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
she
have
learn
to
see
all
her
act
through
the
impression
they
would
make
on
Deronda
:
whatever
relief
may
come
to
her
,
she
could
not
sever
it
from
the
judgment
of
her
that
would
be
create
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
not
one
word
of
flattery
,
of
indulgence
,
of
dependence
on
her
favor
,
could
be
fasten
on
by
her
in
all
their
intercourse
,
to
weaken
his
restrain
power
over
her
(
in
this
way
Deronda
's
effort
over
himself
be
repay
)
;
and
amid
the
dreary
uncertainty
of
her
spoiled
life
the
possible
remedy
that
lie
in
his
mind
,
nay
,
the
remedy
that
lie
in
her
feeling
for
him
,
make
her
only
hope
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
her
a
terrible
-
browe
angel
,
from
whom
she
could
not
think
of
conceal
any
deed
so
as
to
win
an
ignorant
regard
from
him
:
it
belong
to
the
nature
of
their
relation
that
she
should
be
truthful
,
for
his
power
over
her
have
begin
in
the
raising
of
a
self
-
discontent
which
could
be
satisfy
only
by
genuine
change
.
<EOS>
but
in
no
concealment
have
she
now
any
confidence
:
<EOS>
her
vision
of
what
she
have
to
dread
take
more
decidedly
than
ever
the
form
of
some
fiercely
impulsive
deed
,
commit
as
in
a
dream
that
she
would
instantaneously
wake
from
to
find
the
effect
real
though
the
image
have
be
false
:
to
find
death
under
her
hand
,
but
instead
of
darkness
,
daylight
;
instead
of
satisfied
hatred
,
the
dismay
of
guilt
;
instead
of
freedom
,
the
palsy
of
a
new
terror
 
a
white
dead
face
from
which
she
be
forever
try
to
flee
and
forever
hold
back
.
<EOS>
She
remember
Deronda
's
word
:
they
be
continually
recur
in
her
thought
    
"
turn
your
fear
into
a
safeguard
.
<EOS>
keep
your
dread
fix
on
the
idea
of
increase
your
remorse
.
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
*
take
your
fear
as
a
safeguard
.
<EOS>
It
be
like
quickness
of
hearing
.
<EOS>
It
may
make
consequence
passionately
present
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
it
be
.
<EOS>
in
Gwendolen
's
consciousness
temptation
and
dread
meet
and
stare
like
two
pale
phantom
,
each
see
itself
in
the
other
 
each
obstruct
by
its
own
image
;
and
all
the
while
her
full
self
beheld
the
apparition
and
sob
for
deliverance
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
inarticulate
prayer
,
no
more
definite
than
a
cry
,
often
sweep
out
from
her
into
the
vast
silence
,
unbroken
except
by
her
husband
's
breathing
or
the
plash
of
the
wave
or
the
creaking
of
the
mast
;
but
if
ever
she
think
of
definite
help
,
it
take
the
form
of
Deronda
's
presence
and
word
,
of
the
sympathy
he
may
have
for
her
,
of
the
direction
he
may
give
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
sometimes
after
a
white
-
lip
fierce
-
eyed
temptation
with
murder
finger
have
make
its
demon
-
visit
that
these
good
moment
of
inward
cry
and
cling
for
rescue
would
come
to
her
,
and
she
would
lie
with
wide
-
open
eye
in
which
the
rise
tear
seem
a
blessing
,
and
the
thought
,
"
I
will
not
mind
if
I
can
keep
from
get
wicked
,
"
seem
an
answer
to
the
indefinite
prayer
.
  
<EOS>
so
the
day
pass
,
take
with
them
light
breeze
beyond
and
about
the
Balearic
Isles
,
and
then
to
Sardinia
,
and
then
with
gentle
change
persuade
them
northward
again
toward
Corsica
.
<EOS>
but
this
float
,
gentle
-
waft
existence
,
with
its
apparently
peaceful
influence
,
be
become
as
bad
as
a
nightmare
to
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
long
be
we
to
be
yacht
?
<EOS>
"
she
venture
to
ask
one
day
after
they
have
be
touch
at
Ajaccio
,
and
the
mere
fact
of
change
in
go
ashore
have
give
her
a
relief
from
some
of
the
thought
which
seem
now
to
cling
about
the
very
rigging
of
the
vessel
,
mix
with
the
air
in
the
red
silk
<EOS>
cabin
below
,
and
make
the
smell
of
the
sea
odious
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
else
should
we
do
?
"
say
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
tired
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
why
we
should
not
stay
out
any
length
of
time
.
<EOS>
there
be
less
to
bore
one
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
and
where
would
you
go
to
?
<EOS>
I
be
sick
of
foreign
place
.
<EOS>
and
we
shall
have
enough
of
ryeland
.
<EOS>
Would
you
rather
be
at
Ryelands
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
indifferently
,
find
all
place
alike
undescribable
as
soon
as
she
imagine
herself
and
her
husband
in
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
wonder
how
long
you
would
like
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
yacht
longer
than
anything
else
,
"
say
Grandcourt
;
<EOS>
"
and
I
have
none
last
year
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
be
begin
to
tire
of
it
.
<EOS>
woman
be
so
confoundedly
whimsical
.
<EOS>
They
expect
everything
to
give
way
to
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
dear
,
no
!
"
say
Gwendolen
,
let
out
her
scorn
in
a
flute
-
like
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
expect
you
to
give
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
I
?
"
say
Grandcourt
,
with
his
inward
voice
,
look
at
her
,
and
then
choose
an
orange
 
for
they
be
at
table
.
  
<EOS>
She
make
up
her
mind
to
a
length
of
yatching
that
she
could
not
see
beyond
;
but
the
next
day
,
after
a
squall
which
have
make
her
rather
ill
for
the
first
time
,
he
come
down
to
her
and
say
    
"
there
be
be
the
devil
's
own
work
in
the
night
.
<EOS>
the
skipper
say
we
shall
have
to
stay
at
Genoa
for
a
week
while
thing
be
set
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
mind
that
?
"
say
Gwendolen
,
who
lie
look
very
white
amidst
her
white
drapery
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
so
.
<EOS>
who
want
to
be
broil
at
Genoa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
a
change
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
make
a
little
incautious
by
her
languor
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
I
_
do
not
want
any
change
.
<EOS>
besides
,
the
place
be
intolerable
;
and
one
can
not
move
along
the
road
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
out
in
a
boat
,
as
I
use
to
do
,
and
manage
it
myself
.
<EOS>
one
can
get
a
few
hour
every
day
in
that
way
instead
of
strive
in
a
damnable
hotel
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
be
a
prospect
which
hold
hope
in
it
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
think
of
hour
when
she
would
be
alone
,
since
Grandcourt
would
not
want
to
take
her
in
the
say
boat
,
and
in
her
exultation
at
this
unlooke
-
for
relief
,
she
have
wild
,
contradictory
fancy
of
what
she
may
do
with
her
freedom
 
<EOS>
that
"
run
away
"
which
she
have
already
innumerable
time
see
to
be
a
bad
evil
than
any
actual
endurance
,
now
find
new
argument
as
an
escape
from
her
bad
self
.
<EOS>
also
,
visionary
relief
on
a
par
with
the
fancy
of
a
prisoner
that
the
night
wind
may
blow
down
the
wall
of
his
prison
and
save
him
from
desperate
device
,
insinuate
itself
as
a
well
alternative
,
lawful
to
wish
for
.
  
<EOS>
the
fresh
current
of
expectation
revive
her
energy
,
and
enable
her
to
take
all
thing
with
an
air
of
cheerfulness
and
alacrity
that
make
a
change
mark
enough
to
be
notice
by
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
watch
through
the
evening
light
to
the
sinking
of
the
moon
with
less
of
awed
loneliness
than
be
habitual
to
her
 
nay
,
with
a
vague
impression
that
in
this
mighty
frame
of
thing
there
may
be
some
preparation
of
rescue
for
her
.
<EOS>
why
not
?
 
<EOS>
since
the
weather
have
just
be
on
her
side
.
<EOS>
this
possibility
of
hope
,
after
her
long
fluctuation
amid
fear
,
be
like
a
first
return
of
hunger
to
the
long
-
languish
patient
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
wake
the
next
morning
by
the
casting
of
the
anchor
in
the
port
of
Genoa
 
<EOS>
wake
from
a
strangely
-
mixed
dream
in
which
she
feel
herself
escape
over
the
Mont
Cenis
,
and
wonder
to
find
it
warm
even
in
the
moonlight
on
the
snow
,
till
suddenly
she
meet
Deronda
,
who
tell
her
to
go
back
.
  
<EOS>
in
an
hour
or
so
from
that
dream
she
actually
meet
Deronda
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
on
the
palatial
staircase
of
the
_
Italia
_
,
where
she
be
feel
warm
in
her
light
woolen
dress
and
straw
hat
;
and
her
husband
be
by
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
start
of
surprise
in
Deronda
before
he
could
raise
his
hat
and
pass
on
.
<EOS>
the
moment
do
not
seem
to
favor
any
close
greeting
,
and
the
circumstance
under
which
they
have
last
part
make
him
doubtful
whether
Grandcourt
would
be
civilly
inclined
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
doubt
may
certainly
have
be
change
into
a
disagreeable
certainty
,
for
Grandcourt
on
this
unaccountable
appearance
of
Deronda
at
Genoa
of
all
place
,
immediately
try
to
conceive
how
there
could
have
be
an
arrangement
between
him
and
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
before
they
be
well
in
their
room
,
he
have
see
how
difficult
it
be
to
shape
such
an
arrangement
with
any
probability
,
be
too
cool
-
headed
to
find
it
at
once
easily
credible
that
Gwendolen
have
not
only
while
in
London
hasten
to
inform
Deronda
of
the
yachting
project
,
but
have
post
a
letter
to
him
from
Marseilles
or
Barcelona
,
advise
him
to
travel
to
Genoa
in
time
for
the
chance
of
meet
her
there
,
or
of
receive
a
letter
from
her
telling
of
some
other
destination
 
all
which
must
have
imply
a
miraculous
foreknowledge
in
her
,
and
in
Deronda
a
bird
-
like
facility
in
fly
about
and
perch
idly
.
<EOS>
still
he
be
there
,
and
though
Grandcourt
would
not
make
a
fool
of
himself
by
fabrication
that
other
may
call
preposterous
,
he
be
not
,
for
all
that
,
dispose
to
admit
fully
that
Deronda
's
presence
be
,
so
far
as
Gwendolen
be
concern
,
a
mere
accident
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
disgusting
fact
;
that
be
enough
;
and
no
doubt
she
be
well
pleased
.
<EOS>
a
man
out
of
temper
do
not
wait
for
proof
before
feel
toward
all
thing
animate
and
inanimate
as
if
they
be
in
a
conspiracy
against
him
,
but
at
once
thresh
his
horse
or
kick
his
dog
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
feel
toward
Gwendolen
and
Deronda
as
if
he
know
them
to
be
in
a
conspiracy
against
him
,
and
here
be
an
event
in
league
with
them
.
<EOS>
what
he
take
for
clearly
certain
 
<EOS>
and
so
far
he
divine
the
truth
 
<EOS>
be
that
Gwendolen
be
now
count
on
an
interview
with
Deronda
whenever
her
husband
's
back
be
turn
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
sit
take
his
coffee
at
a
convenient
angle
for
observe
her
,
he
discern
something
which
he
feel
sure
<EOS>
be
the
effect
of
a
secret
delight
 
some
fresh
ease
in
move
and
speak
,
some
peculiar
meaning
in
her
eye
,
whatever
she
look
on
.
<EOS>
certainly
her
trouble
have
not
mar
her
beauty
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grandcourt
be
handsome
than
Gwendolen
Harleth
<EOS>
:
her
grace
and
expression
be
inform
by
a
great
variety
of
inward
experience
,
give
new
play
to
her
feature
,
new
attitude
in
movement
and
repose
;
her
whole
person
and
air
have
the
nameless
something
which
often
make
a
woman
more
interesting
after
marriage
than
before
,
less
confident
that
all
thing
be
accord
to
her
opinion
,
and
yet
with
less
of
deer
-
like
shyness
 
more
fully
a
human
being
.
  
<EOS>
this
morning
the
benefit
of
the
voyage
seem
to
be
suddenly
reveal
themselves
in
a
new
elasticity
of
mien
.
<EOS>
as
she
rise
from
the
table
and
put
her
two
heavily
-
jewel
hand
on
each
side
of
her
neck
,
accord
to
her
will
not
,
she
have
no
art
to
conceal
that
sort
of
joyous
expectation
which
make
the
present
more
bearable
than
usual
,
just
as
when
a
man
mean
to
go
out
<EOS>
he
find
it
easy
to
be
amiable
to
the
family
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
beforehand
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
impossible
that
a
terrier
whose
pleasure
be
concern
would
perceive
those
amiable
sign
and
know
their
meaning
 
know
why
his
master
stand
in
a
peculiar
way
,
talk
with
alacrity
,
and
even
have
a
peculiar
gleam
in
his
eye
,
so
that
on
the
least
movement
toward
the
door
,
the
terrier
would
scuttle
to
be
in
time
.
<EOS>
and
,
in
dog
fashion
,
Grandcourt
discern
the
sign
of
Gwendolen
's
expectation
,
interpret
them
with
the
narrow
correctness
which
leave
a
world
of
unknown
feeling
behind
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
 
just
ring
,
please
,
and
tell
gibb
to
order
some
dinner
for
us
at
three
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
as
he
too
rise
,
take
out
a
cigar
,
and
then
stretch
his
hand
toward
the
hat
that
lie
near
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
to
send
Angus
to
find
a
little
sailing
-
boat
for
us
to
go
out
in
;
one
that
I
can
manage
,
with
you
at
the
tiller
.
<EOS>
It
be
uncommonly
pleasant
these
fine
evening
 
the
least
boring
of
anything
we
can
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
turn
cold
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
only
the
cruel
disappointment
;
there
be
the
immediate
conviction
that
her
husband
have
determine
to
take
her
because
he
would
not
leave
her
out
of
his
sight
;
and
probably
this
dual
solitude
in
a
boat
be
the
more
attractive
to
him
because
it
would
be
wearisome
to
her
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
on
the
plank
-
island
;
she
feel
it
the
more
possible
to
begin
a
contest
.
<EOS>
but
the
gleaming
content
have
die
out
of
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
change
in
her
like
that
of
a
glacier
after
sunset
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
not
go
in
the
boat
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
take
some
one
else
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
;
if
you
do
not
go
,
I
shall
not
go
,
"
say
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
stay
suffocate
here
,
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
bear
to
go
in
a
boat
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
angrily
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
sudden
change
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
with
a
slight
sneer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
,
since
you
decline
,
we
shall
stay
indoor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
lay
down
his
hat
again
,
light
his
cigar
,
and
walk
up
and
down
the
room
,
pause
now
and
then
to
look
out
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
temper
tell
her
to
persist
.
<EOS>
She
know
very
well
now
that
Grandcourt
would
not
go
without
her
;
but
if
he
must
tyrannize
over
her
,
he
should
not
do
it
precisely
in
the
way
he
would
choose
.
<EOS>
She
would
oblige
him
to
stay
in
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
without
speak
again
,
she
pass
into
the
adjoin
bedroom
and
throw
herself
into
a
chair
with
her
anger
,
see
no
purpose
or
issue
 
<EOS>
only
feel
that
the
wave
of
evil
have
rush
back
upon
her
,
and
drag
her
away
from
her
momentary
breathing
-
place
.
  
<EOS>
presently
Grandcourt
come
in
with
his
hat
on
,
but
throw
it
off
and
sit
down
sideways
on
a
chair
nearly
in
front
of
her
,
say
,
in
his
superficial
drawl
    
"
have
you
come
round
yet
?
<EOS>
or
do
you
find
it
agreeable
to
be
out
of
temper
.
<EOS>
You
make
thing
uncommonly
pleasant
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
want
to
make
them
unpleasant
for
_
me
_
?
"
say
Gwendolen
,
get
helpless
again
,
and
feel
the
hot
tear
rise
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
will
you
be
good
enough
to
say
what
it
be
you
have
to
complain
of
?
"
say
Grandcourt
,
look
into
her
eye
,
and
use
his
most
inward
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
be
it
that
I
stay
indoor
when
you
stay
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
could
give
no
answer
.
<EOS>
the
sort
of
truth
that
make
any
excuse
for
her
anger
could
not
be
utter
.
<EOS>
in
the
conflict
of
despair
and
humiliation
she
begin
to
sob
,
and
the
tear
roll
down
her
cheek
 
<EOS>
a
form
of
agitation
which
she
have
never
show
before
in
her
husband
's
presence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
this
be
useful
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
after
a
moment
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
all
I
can
say
be
,
it
be
most
confoundedly
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
what
the
devil
woman
can
see
in
this
kind
of
thing
,
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
_
You
_
see
something
to
be
get
by
it
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
all
I
can
see
be
,
that
we
shall
be
shut
up
here
when
we
may
have
be
have
a
pleasant
sail
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
us
go
,
then
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
impetuously
.
<EOS>
"
perhaps
we
shall
be
drown
.
<EOS>
"
She
begin
to
sob
again
.
  
<EOS>
this
extraordinary
behavior
,
which
have
evidently
some
relation
to
Deronda
,
give
more
definiteness
to
Grandcourt
's
conclusion
.
<EOS>
He
draw
his
chair
quite
close
in
front
of
her
,
and
say
,
in
a
low
tone
,
"
just
be
quiet
and
listen
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
there
seem
to
be
a
magical
effect
in
this
close
vicinity
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
shrink
and
cease
to
sob
.
<EOS>
She
keep
her
eyelid
down
and
clasp
her
hand
tightly
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
us
understand
each
other
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
in
the
same
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
very
well
what
this
nonsense
mean
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
suppose
I
be
go
to
let
you
make
a
fool
of
me
,
just
dismiss
that
notion
from
your
mind
.
<EOS>
what
be
you
look
forward
to
,
if
you
can
not
behave
properly
as
my
wife
?
<EOS>
there
be
disgrace
for
you
,
if
you
like
to
have
it
,
but
I
do
not
know
anything
else
;
and
as
to
Deronda
,
it
be
quite
clear
that
he
hang
back
from
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
false
!
"
<EOS>
say
Gwendolen
,
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
do
not
in
the
least
imagine
what
be
in
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
enough
of
the
disgrace
that
come
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
and
you
have
better
leave
me
at
liberty
to
speak
with
any
one
I
like
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
well
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
allow
me
to
judge
of
that
,
"
say
Grandcourt
,
rise
and
move
to
a
little
distance
toward
the
window
,
but
stand
there
play
with
his
whisker
as
if
he
be
await
something
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
word
have
so
clear
and
tremendous
<EOS>
a
meaning
for
herself
that
she
think
they
must
have
express
it
to
Grandcourt
,
and
have
no
sooner
utter
them
than
she
dread
their
effect
.
<EOS>
but
his
soul
be
garrison
against
presentiment
and
fear
:
he
have
the
courage
and
confidence
that
belong
to
domination
,
and
he
be
at
that
moment
feel
perfectly
satisfied
that
he
hold
his
wife
with
bit
and
bridle
.
<EOS>
by
the
time
they
have
be
marry
a
year
she
would
cease
to
be
restive
.
<EOS>
He
continue
stand
with
his
air
of
indifference
,
till
she
feel
her
habitual
stifle
consciousness
of
have
an
immovable
obstruction
in
her
life
,
like
the
nightmare
of
behold
a
single
form
that
serve
to
arrest
all
passage
though
the
wide
country
lie
open
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
decision
have
you
come
to
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
presently
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
order
shall
I
give
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
let
us
go
,
"
say
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
the
wall
have
begin
to
be
an
imprisonment
,
and
while
there
be
breath
in
this
man
he
would
have
the
mastery
over
her
.
<EOS>
His
word
have
the
power
of
thumb
-
screw
and
the
cold
touch
of
the
rock
.
<EOS>
to
resist
be
to
act
like
a
stupid
animal
unable
to
measure
result
.
  
<EOS>
so
the
boat
be
order
.
<EOS>
She
even
go
down
to
the
quay
again
with
him
to
see
it
before
midday
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
have
recover
perfect
quietude
of
temper
,
and
have
a
scornful
satisfaction
in
the
attention
give
by
the
nautical
group
to
the
_
milord
_
,
owner
of
the
handsome
yacht
which
have
just
put
in
for
repair
,
and
who
be
an
Englishman
be
naturally
so
at
home
on
the
sea
that
he
could
manage
a
sail
with
the
same
ease
that
he
could
manage
a
horse
.
<EOS>
the
sort
of
exultation
he
have
discern
in
Gwendolen
this
morning
<EOS>
she
now
think
that
she
discern
in
him
;
and
it
be
true
that
he
have
set
his
mind
on
this
boating
,
and
carry
out
his
purpose
as
something
that
people
may
not
expect
him
to
do
,
with
the
gratify
impulse
of
a
strong
will
which
have
nothing
well
to
exert
itself
upon
.
<EOS>
He
have
remarkable
physical
courage
,
and
be
proud
of
it
 
or
rather
he
have
a
great
contempt
for
the
coarser
,
bulkier
man
who
generally
have
less
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
he
be
rule
that
Gwendolen
should
go
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
and
when
they
come
down
again
at
five
o'clock
,
equip
for
their
boating
,
the
scene
be
as
good
as
a
theatrical
representation
for
all
beholder
.
<EOS>
this
handsome
,
fair
-
skinned
english
couple
,
manifest
the
usual
eccentricity
of
their
nation
,
both
of
them
proud
,
pale
,
and
calm
,
without
a
smile
on
their
face
,
move
like
creature
who
be
fulfil
a
supernatural
destiny
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
thing
to
go
out
and
see
,
a
thing
to
paint
.
<EOS>
the
husband
's
chest
,
back
,
and
arm
,
show
very
well
in
his
close
-
fit
dress
,
and
the
wife
be
declare
to
be
a
statue
.
  
<EOS>
some
suggestion
be
proffer
concern
a
possible
change
in
the
breeze
,
and
the
necessary
care
in
put
about
,
but
Grandcourt
's
manner
make
the
speaker
understand
that
they
be
too
officious
,
and
that
he
know
better
than
they
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
keep
her
impassable
air
,
as
they
move
away
from
the
strand
,
feel
her
imagination
obstinately
at
work
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
afraid
of
any
outward
danger
 
<EOS>
she
be
afraid
of
her
own
wish
which
be
take
shape
possible
and
impossible
,
like
a
cloud
of
demon
-
face
.
<EOS>
She
be
afraid
of
her
own
hatred
,
which
under
the
cold
iron
touch
that
have
compel
her
to
-
day
have
gather
a
fierce
intensity
.
<EOS>
as
she
sit
guide
the
tiller
under
her
husband
's
eye
,
do
just
what
he
tell
her
,
the
strife
within
her
seem
like
her
own
effort
to
escape
from
herself
.
<EOS>
She
cling
to
the
thought
of
Deronda
:
she
persuade
herself
that
he
would
not
go
away
while
she
be
there
 
<EOS>
he
know
that
she
need
help
.
<EOS>
the
sense
that
he
be
there
would
save
her
from
act
out
the
evil
within
.
<EOS>
and
yet
quick
,
quick
,
come
image
,
plan
of
evil
that
would
come
again
and
seize
her
in
the
night
,
like
fury
prepare
the
deed
that
they
would
straightway
avenge
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
take
out
of
the
port
and
carry
eastward
by
a
gentle

DANTE
.
   
<EOS>
when
Deronda
meet
Gwendolen
and
Grandcourt
on
the
staircase
,
his
mind
be
seriously
preoccupy
.
<EOS>
He
have
just
be
summon
to
the
second
interview
with
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
in
two
hour
after
his
parting
from
her
he
know
that
the
Princess
Halm
-
Eberstein
have
leave
the
hotel
,
and
so
far
as
the
purpose
of
his
journey
to
Genoa
be
concern
,
he
may
himself
have
set
off
on
his
way
to
Mainz
,
to
deliver
the
letter
from
Joseph
Kalonymos
,
and
get
possession
of
the
family
chest
.
<EOS>
but
mix
mental
condition
,
which
do
not
resolve
themselves
into
definite
reason
,
hinder
him
from
departure
.
<EOS>
long
after
the
farewell
he
be
keep
passive
by
a
weight
of
retrospective
feeling
.
<EOS>
He
live
again
,
with
the
new
keenness
of
emotive
memory
,
through
the
exciting
scene
which
seem
past
only
in
the
sense
of
preparation
for
their
actual
presence
in
his
soul
.
<EOS>
He
allow
himself
in
his
solitude
to
sob
,
with
perhaps
more
than
a
woman
's
acuteness
of
compassion
,
over
that
woman
's
life
so
near
to
his
,
and
yet
so
remote
.
<EOS>
He
behold
the
world
change
for
him
by
the
certitude
of
tie
that
alter
the
poise
of
hope
and
fear
,
and
give
him
a
new
sense
of
fellowship
,
as
if
under
cover
of
the
night
he
have
join
the
wrong
band
of
wanderer
,
and
find
with
the
rise
of
morning
that
the
tent
of
his
kindre
be
group
far
off
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
quiver
imaginative
sense
of
close
relation
to
the
grandfather
who
have
be
animate
by
strong
impulse
and
beloved
thought
,
which
be
now
perhaps
be
rouse
from
their
slumber
within
himself
.
<EOS>
and
through
all
this
passionate
meditation
Mordecai
and
Mirah
be
always
present
,
as
being
who
clasp
hand
with
him
in
sympathetic
silence
.
  
<EOS>
of
such
quick
,
responsive
fibre
be
Deronda
make
,
under
that
mantle
of
self
-
control
reserve
into
which
early
experience
have
throw
so
much
of
his
young
strength
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
persistent
ringing
of
a
bell
as
a
signal
remind
him
of
the
hour
he
think
of
look
into
_
Bradshaw
_
,
and
make
the
brief
necessary
preparation
for
start
by
the
next
train
 
thought
of
it
,
but
make
no
movement
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
Wishes
go
to
Mainz
and
what
he
be
to
get
possession
of
there
 
to
London
and
the
being
there
who
make
the
strong
attachment
of
his
life
;
but
there
be
other
wish
that
cling
in
these
moment
to
Genoa
,
and
they
keep
him
where
he
be
by
that
force
which
urge
us
to
linger
over
an
interview
that
carry
a
presentiment
of
final
farewell
or
of
overshadow
sorrow
.
<EOS>
Deronda
do
not
formally
say
,
"
I
will
stay
over
to
-
night
,
because
it
be
Friday
,
and
I
should
like
to
go
to
the
evening
service
at
the
synagogue
where
they
must
all
have
go
;
and
besides
,
I
may
see
the
Grandcourts
again
.
"
<EOS>
but
simply
,
instead
of
pack
and
ring
for
his
bill
,
he
sit
do
nothing
at
all
,
while
his
mind
go
to
the
synagogue
and
see
face
there
probably
little
different
from
those
of
his
grandfather
's
time
,
and
hear
the
spanish
-
hebrew
liturgy
which
have
last
through
the
season
of
wander
generation
like
a
plant
with
wander
seed
,
that
give
the
far
-
off
land
a
kinship
to
the
exile
's
home
 
<EOS>
while
,
also
,
his
mind
go
toward
Gwendolen
,
with
anxious
remembrance
of
what
have
be
,
and
with
a
half
-
admit
impression
that
it
would
be
hardness
in
him
willingly
to
go
away
at
once
without
make
some
effort
,
in
spite
of
Grandcourt
's
probable
dislike
,
to
manifest
the
continuance
of
his
sympathy
with
her
since
their
abrupt
parting
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
state
of
mind
he
defer
departure
,
eat
his
dinner
without
sense
of
flavor
,
rise
from
it
quickly
to
find
the
synagogue
,
and
in
pass
the
porter
<EOS>
ask
if
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Grandcourt
be
still
in
the
hotel
,
and
what
be
the
number
of
their
apartment
.
<EOS>
the
porter
give
him
the
number
,
but
add
that
they
be
go
out
boat
.
<EOS>
that
information
have
somehow
power
enough
over
Deronda
to
divide
his
thought
with
the
memory
<EOS>
waken
among
the
sparse
_
talithim
_
and
keen
dark
face
of
worshipper
whose
way
of
take
awful
prayer
and
invocation
with
the
easy
familiarity
which
may
be
call
Hebrew
dye
Italian
,
make
him
reflect
that
his
grandfather
,
accord
to
the
Princess
's
hint
of
his
character
,
must
have
be
almost
as
exceptional
a
Jew
as
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
but
be
not
man
of
ardent
zeal
and
far
-
reach
hope
everywhere
exceptional
?
<EOS>
the
man
who
have
the
vision
which
,
as
Mordecai
say
,
be
the
creator
and
feeder
of
the
world
 
moulding
and
feed
the
more
passive
life
which
without
them
would
dwindle
and
shrivel
into
the
narrow
tenacity
of
insect
,
unshaken
by
thought
beyond
the
reach
of
their
antennae
.
<EOS>
something
of
a
mournful
impatience
perhaps
add
itself
to
the
solicitude
about
Gwendolen
(
a
solicitude
that
have
room
to
grow
in
his
present
release
from
immediate
care
)
as
an
incitement
to
hasten
from
the
synagogue
and
choose
to
take
his
evening
walk
toward
the
quay
,
always
a
favorite
haunt
with
him
,
and
just
now
attractive
with
the
possibility
that
he
may
be
in
time
to
see
the
Grandcourts
come
in
from
their
boating
.
<EOS>
in
this
case
,
he
resolve
that
he
would
advance
to
greet
them
deliberately
,
and
ignore
any
ground
that
the
husband
may
have
for
wish
him
elsewhere
.
  
<EOS>
the
sun
have
set
behind
a
bank
of
cloud
,
and
only
a
faint
yellow
light
be
give
its
farewell
kiss
to
the
wave
,
which
be
agitate
by
an
active
breeze
.
<EOS>
Deronda
,
saunter
slowly
within
sight
of
what
take
place
on
the
strand
,
observe
the
group
there
concentrate
their
attention
on
a
sailing
-
boat
which
be
advance
swiftly
landward
,
be
row
by
two
man
.
<EOS>
amidst
the
clamorous
talk
in
various
language
,
Deronda
hold
it
the
sure
mean
of
get
information
not
to
ask
question
,
but
to
elbow
his
way
to
the
foreground
and
be
an
unobstructed
witness
of
what
be
occur
.
<EOS>
telescope
be
be
use
,
and
loud
statement
make
that
the
boat
hold
somebody
who
have
be
drown
.
<EOS>
one
say
it
be
the
_
milord
_
who
have
go
out
in
a
sailing
boat
;
another
maintain
that
the
prostrate
figure
he
discern
be
_
miladi
_
;
<EOS>
a
Frenchman
who
have
no
glass
would
rather
say
that
it
be
_
milord
_
who
have
probably
take
his
wife
out
to
drown
her
,
accord
to
the
national
practice
 
a
remark
which
an
English
skipper
immediately
comment
on
in
our
native
idiom
(
as
nonsense
which
 
have
undergo
a
mining
operation
)
,
and
further
dismiss
by
the
decision
that
the
reclining
figure
be
a
woman
.
<EOS>
for
Deronda
,
terribly
excited
by
fluctuate
fear
,
the
stroke
of
the
oar
as
he
watch
them
be
divide
by
swift
vision
of
event
,
possible
and
impossible
,
which
may
have
bring
about
this
issue
,
or
this
break
-
off
fragment
of
an
issue
,
with
a
bad
half
undisclosed
 
if
this
woman
apparently
snatch
from
the
water
be
really
Mrs.
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
but
soon
there
be
no
longer
any
doubt
:
the
boat
be
be
pull
to
land
,
and
he
see
Gwendolen
<EOS>
half
raise
herself
on
her
hand
,
by
her
own
effort
,
under
her
heavy
covering
of
tarpaulin
and
pea
-
jacket
 
pale
as
one
of
the
sheet
dead
,
shivering
,
with
wet
hair
streaming
,
a
wild
amazed
consciousness
in
her
eye
,
as
if
she
have
wake
up
in
a
world
where
some
judgment
be
impend
,
and
the
being
she
see
around
be
come
to
seize
her
.
<EOS>
the
first
rower
who
jump
to
land
be
also
wet
through
,
and
run
off
;
the
sailor
,
close
about
the
boat
,
hinder
Deronda
from
advance
,
and
he
could
only
look
on
while
Gwendolen
give
scared
glance
,
and
seem
to
shrink
with
terror
as
she
be
carefully
,
tenderly
help
out
,
and
lead
on
by
the
strong
arm
of
those
rough
,
bronze
man
,
her
wet
clothe
cling
about
her
limb
,
and
add
to
the
impediment
of
her
weakness
.
<EOS>
suddenly
her
wander
eye
fall
on
Deronda
,
stand
before
her
,
and
immediately
,
as
if
she
have
be
expect
him
and
look
for
him
<EOS>
,
she
try
to
stretch
out
her
arm
,
which
be
hold
back
by
her
supporter
,
say
,
in
a
muffled
voice
    
<EOS>
"
It
be
come
,
it
be
come
!
<EOS>
He
be
dead
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
hush
,
hush
!
"
say
Deronda
,
in
a
tone
of
authority
;
"
quiet
yourself
.
"
<EOS>
then
to
the
man
who
be
assist
her
,
"
I
be
a
connection
of
this
lady
's
husband
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
get
her
on
to
the
_
Italia
_
as
quickly
as
possible
,
I
will
undertake
everything
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
stay
behind
to
hear
from
the
remain
boatman
that
her
husband
have
go
down
irrecoverably
,
and
that
his
boat
be
leave
float
empty
.
<EOS>
He
and
his
comrade
have
hear
a
cry
,
have
come
up
in
time
to
see
the
lady
jump
in
after
her
husband
,
and
have
get
her
out
fast
enough
to
save
her
from
much
damage
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
,
Deronda
hasten
to
the
hotel
to
assure
himself
that
the
good
medical
help
would
be
provide
;
and
be
satisfied
on
this
point
,
he
telegraph
the
event
to
Sir
Hugo
,
beg
him
to
come
forthwith
,
and
also
to
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
whose
address
at
the
rectory
make
his
near
know
way
of
get
the
information
to
Gwendolen
's
mother
.
<EOS>
certain
word
of
Gwendolen
's
in
the
past
have
come
back
to
him
with
the
effectiveness
of
an
inspiration
:
in
moment
of
agitated
confession
she
have
speak
of
her
mother
's
presence
,
as
a
possible
help
,
if
she
could
have
have
it
.
      
<EOS>
"
the
pang
,
the
curse
with
which
they
die
,
    
have
never
pass
away
:
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
draw
my
eye
from
theirs
,
    
nor
lift
them
up
to
pray
.

COLERIDGE

<EOS>
Deronda
do
not
take
off
his
clothe
that
night
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
after
insist
on
see
him
again
before
she
would
consent
to
be
undress
,
have
be
perfectly
quiet
,
and
have
only
ask
him
,
with
a
whispering
,
repressed
eagerness
,
to
promise
that
he
would
come
to
her
when
she
send
for
him
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
still
,
the
possibility
that
a
change
may
come
over
her
,
the
danger
of
a
supervene
feverish
condition
,
and
the
suspicion
that
something
in
the
late
catastrophe
be
have
an
effect
which
may
betray
itself
in
excited
word
,
act
as
a
foreboding
within
him
.
<EOS>
He
mention
to
her
attendant
that
he
should
keep
himself
ready
to
be
call
if
there
be
any
alarming
change
of
symptom
,
make
it
understand
by
all
concern
that
he
be
in
communication
with
her
friend
in
England
,
and
feel
bind
meanwhile
to
take
all
care
on
her
behalf
 
a
position
which
it
be
the
easy
for
him
to
assume
,
because
he
be
well
known
to
Grandcourt
's
valet
,
the
only
old
servant
who
have
come
on
the
late
voyage
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
fatigue
from
the
strangely
various
emotion
of
the
day
at
last
send
Deronda
to
sleep
<EOS>
,
he
remain
undisturbed
except
by
the
morning
dream
,
which
come
as
a
tangle
web
of
yesterday
's
event
,
and
finally
wake
him
,
with
an
image
draw
by
his
press
anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
still
,
it
be
morning
,
and
there
have
be
no
summon
 
<EOS>
an
augury
which
cheer
him
while
he
make
his
toilet
,
and
reflect
that
it
be
too
early
to
send
inquiry
.
<EOS>
later
,
he
learn
that
she
have
pass
a
too
wakeful
night
,
but
have
show
no
violent
sign
of
agitation
,
and
be
at
last
sleeping
.
<EOS>
He
wonder
at
the
force
that
dwell
in
this
creature
,
so
alive
to
dread
;
for
he
have
an
irresistible
impression
that
even
under
the
effect
of
a
severe
physical
shock
she
be
master
herself
with
a
determination
of
concealment
.
<EOS>
for
his
own
part
,
he
think
that
his
sensibility
have
be
blunt
by
what
he
have
be
go
through
in
the
meeting
with
his
mother
:
he
seem
to
himself
now
to
be
only
fulfil
claim
,
and
his
more
passionate
sympathy
be
in
abeyance
.
<EOS>
He
have
lately
be
live
so
keenly
in
an
experience
quite
apart
from
Gwendolen
's
lot
,
that
his
present
care
for
her
be
like
a
revisiting
of
scene
familiar
in
the
past
,
and
there
be
not
yet
a
complete
revival
of
the
inward
response
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
he
employ
himself
in
get
a
formal
,
legally
recognize
statement
from
the
fisherman
who
have
rescue
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
few
detail
come
to
light
.
<EOS>
the
boat
in
which
Grandcourt
have
go
out
have
be
find
drift
with
its
sail
loose
,
and
have
be
tow
in
.
<EOS>
the
fisherman
think
it
likely
that
he
have
be
knock
overboard
by
the
flapping
of
the
sail
while
put
about
,
and
that
he
have
not
know
how
to
swim
;
but
,
though
they
be
near
,
their
attention
have
be
first
arrest
by
a
cry
which
seem
like
that
of
a
man
in
distress
,
and
while
they
be
hasten
with
their
oar
,
they
hear
a
shriek
from
the
lady
,
and
see
her
jump
in
.
  
<EOS>
on
re
-
enter
the
hotel
,
Deronda
be
tell
that
Gwendolen
have
rise
,
and
be
desire
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
show
into
a
room
darken
by
blind
and
curtain
,
where
she
be
seat
with
a
white
shawl
wrap
round
her
,
look
toward
the
opening
door
like
one
wait
uneasily
.
<EOS>
but
her
long
hair
be
gather
up
and
coil
carefully
,
and
,
through
all
,
the
blue
star
in
her
ear
have
keep
their
place
:
as
she
start
impulsively
to
her
full
height
,
sheathe
in
her
white
shawl
,
her
face
and
neck
not
less
white
,
except
for
a
purple
line
under
her
eye
,
<EOS>
her
lip
a
little
apart
with
the
peculiar
expression
of
one
accuse
and
helpless
<EOS>
,
she
look
like
the
unhappy
ghost
of
that
Gwendolen
Harleth
whom
Deronda
have
see
turn
with
firm
lip
and
proud
self
-
possession
from
her
loss
at
the
gaming
table
.
<EOS>
the
sight
pierce
him
with
pity
,
and
the
effect
of
all
their
past
relation
begin
to
revive
within
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beseech
you
to
rest
 
not
to
stand
,
"
say
Deronda
,
as
he
approach
her
;
and
she
obey
,
fall
back
into
her
chair
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
sit
down
near
me
?
<EOS>
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
speak
very
low
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
in
a
large
arm
-
chair
,
and
he
draw
a
small
one
near
to
her
side
.
<EOS>
the
action
seem
to
touch
her
peculiarly
:
turn
her
pale
face
full
upon
his
,
which
be
very
near
,
she
say
,
in
the
low
audible
tone
,
"
You
know
I
be
a
guilty
woman
?
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
himself
turn
paler
as
he
say
,
"
I
know
nothing
.
"
<EOS>
He
do
not
dare
to
say
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
dead
.
"
<EOS>
She
utter
this
with
the
same
undertoned
decision
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Deronda
,
in
a
mournful
suspense
which
make
him
reluctant
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
face
will
not
be
see
above
the
water
again
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
in
a
tone
that
be
not
loud
,
but
of
a
suppress
eagerness
,
while
she
hold
both
her
hand
clench
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
.
"
  
"
not
by
any
one
else
 
only
by
me
 
a
dead
face
 
I
shall
never
get
away
from
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
with
an
inward
voice
of
desperate
self
-
repression
that
she
speak
these
last
word
,
while
she
look
away
from
Deronda
toward
something
at
a
distance
from
her
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
She
be
see
the
whole
event
 
<EOS>
her
own
act
include
 
through
an
exaggerate
medium
of
excitement
and
horror
?
<EOS>
be
she
in
a
state
of
delirium
into
which
there
enter
a
sense
of
concealment
and
necessity
for
self
-
repression
?
<EOS>
such
thought
glance
through
Deronda
as
a
sort
of
hope
.
<EOS>
but
imagine
the
conflict
of
feeling
that
keep
him
silent
.
<EOS>
She
be
bent
on
confession
,
and
he
dread
hear
her
confession
.
<EOS>
against
his
well
will
he
shrink
from
the
task
that
be
lay
on
him
:
he
wish
,
and
yet
rebuke
the
wish
as
cowardly
,
that
she
could
bury
her
secret
in
her
own
bosom
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
priest
.
<EOS>
He
dread
the
weight
of
this
woman
's
soul
fling
upon
his
own
with
imploring
dependence
.
<EOS>
but
she
speak
again
,
hurriedly
,
look
at
him
    
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
say
that
I
ought
to
tell
the
world

<EOS>
you
will
not

<EOS>
I
could
not

I

I

my
mother

<EOS>
"
I
can
say
nothing
in
my
ignorance

Deronda
,
mournfully
,

that
I
desire
to
help
you

I
tell
you
from

there
be
a
piteous
pleading
in
the
low
murmur
in
which
Deronda
turn
his
ear
only
.
<EOS>
Her
face
afflict
him
too
much

I
feel
a
hatred
in
me

why
I
ask
you

through
her
;

soon
go
on

a

Great

Deronda

in

deep
,
shaken
voice

You

the
tremor

childlike

compel
Deronda
to
turn
his
head
and
look
at
her
face

the
poor
quivering
lip
go
on

"
<EOS>
You
say
 
you
use
to
say
 
you
feel
more
for
those
who
have
do
something
wicked

be
miserable

you

they
may
get
well

they

<EOS>
Her
hand
,
which
have
be
so
tightly
clench
some
minute
before
,
be
now
helplessly
relaxed
and
tremble
on
the
arm
of
her
chair

Her
quivering
lip
remain
parted

cease

Deronda
could
not
answer
;
he
be
oblige
to
look
away
.
<EOS>
He
take
one
of
her
hand
,
and
clasp
it
as
if
they
be
go
to
walk
together
like
two
child
:
it
be
the
only
way
in
which
he
could
answer
,
"
I
will
not
forsake
you

<EOS>
and
all
the
while
he
feel
as
if
he
be
put
his
name
to
a
blank
paper
which
may
be
fill
up
terribly
.
<EOS>
Their
attitude
,
his
adverted
face
with
its
expression
of
a
suffering
which
he
be
solemnly
resolve
to
undergo
,
may
have
tell
half
the
truth
of
the
situation
to
a
beholder
who
have
suddenly
enter
.
  
<EOS>
that
grasp
be
an
entirely
new
experience
to
Gwendolen
:
she
have
never
before
have
from
any
man
a
sign
of
tenderness
which
her
own
being
have
need
,
and
she
interpret
its
powerful
effect
on
her
into
a
promise
of
inexhaustible
patience
and
constancy
.
<EOS>
the
stream
of
renew
strength
make
it
possible
for
her
to
go
on
as
she
have
begin
 
with
that
fitful
,
wander
confession
where
the
sameness
of
experience
seem
to
nullify
the
sense
of
time
or
of
order
in
event
.
<EOS>
She
begin
again
in
a
fragmentary
way
    
<EOS>
"
all
sort
of
contrivance
in
my
mind
 
but
all
so
difficult
.
<EOS>
and
I
fight
against
them
 
<EOS>
I
be
terrified
at
them
 
<EOS>
I
see
his
dead
face
"
 
<EOS>
here
her
voice
sink
almost
to
a
whisper
close
to
Deronda
's
ear
 
"
<EOS>
ever
so
long
ago
I
see
it
<EOS>
and
I
wish
him
to
be
dead
.
<EOS>
and
yet
it
terrify
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
like
two
creature
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
speak
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
kill
 
<EOS>
it
be
as
strong
as
thirst
 
<EOS>
and
then
directly
 
I
feel
beforehand
<EOS>
I
have
do
something
dreadful
,
unalterable
 
<EOS>
that
would
make
me
like
an
evil
spirit
.
<EOS>
and
it
come
 
it
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
silent
a
moment
or
two
,
as
if
her
memory
have
lose
itself
in
a
web
where
each
mesh
draw
all
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
have
all
be
in
my
mind
when
I
first
speak
to
you
 
when
we
be
at
the
Abbey
.
<EOS>
I
have
do
something
then
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
tell
you
that
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
only
thing
I
do
toward
carry
out
my
thought
.
<EOS>
They
go
about
over
everything
;
but
they
all
remain
like
dreadful
dream
 
all
but
one
.
<EOS>
I
do
one
act
 
<EOS>
and
I
never
undo
it
 
<EOS>
it
be
there
still
 
as
long
ago
as
when
we
be
at
Ryelands
.
<EOS>
there
it
be
 
something
my
finger
long
for
among
the
beautiful
toy
in
the
cabinet
in
my
boudoir
 
small
and
sharp
like
a
long
willow
leaf
in
a
silver
sheath
.
<EOS>
I
lock
it
in
the
drawer
of
my
dressing
-
case
.
<EOS>
I
be
continually
haunt
with
it
and
how
I
should
use
it
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
myself
put
it
under
my
pillow
.
<EOS>
but
I
never
do
.
<EOS>
I
never
look
at
it
again
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
unlock
the
drawer
:
it
have
a
key
all
to
itself
;
and
not
long
ago
,
when
we
be
in
the
yacht
,
I
drop
the
key
into
the
deep
water
.
<EOS>
It
be
my
wish
to
drop
it
and
deliver
myself
.
<EOS>
after
that
I
begin
to
think
how
I
could
open
the
drawer
without
the
key
:
and
when
I
find
we
be
to
stay
at
Genoa
,
it
come
into
my
mind
that
I
could
get
it
open
privately
at
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
when
we
be
go
up
the
stair
,
I
meet
you
;
and
I
think
I
should
talk
to
you
alone
and
tell
you
this
 
everything
I
could
not
tell
you
in
town
;
and
then
I
be
force
to
go
out
in
the
boat

"
  
<EOS>
a
sob
have
for
the
first
time
rise
with
the
last
word

and
she
sink
back
in
her
chair

<EOS>
the
memory
of
that
acute
disappointment
seem
for
the
moment
to
efface
what
have
come
since

<EOS>
Deronda
do
not
look
at

he
say
,
insistently

it
have
all
remain
in
your

It
have
go
on
only
in
your

to
the
last
the
evil
temptation
have
be

<EOS>
there
be
silence

<EOS>
the
tear
have
roll
down
her
cheek

She
press
her
handkerchief
against
them

sit
upright

She
be
summon
her
resolution

and
again
,
lean
a
little
toward
Deronda
's
ear
<EOS>

she
begin
in
a
whisper
    
"
no

no

I
will
tell
you
everything

I

tell
you
no

I
will
tell
you
the
exact
truth

what
should
I
do
else
?
<EOS>
I
use
to
think
I
could
never

wicked

I
think
of
wicked
people
as
if
they
be
a
long
way
off
me

since
then
I
have
be
wicked

I
have
feel
wicked

and
everything
have
be
a
punishment
to
me
 
all
the
thing
I
use
to
wish
for

it
be
as
if
they
have
be
make
red

hot

the
very
daylight
have
often
be
a
punishment

break

mean
to
get
pleasure

it
all
turn
to
misery

I
want
to
make
my
gain
out
of
another
's
loss
 
you
remember
?
 
<EOS>
it
be
like
roulette
 
and
the
money
burn
into
me

and
I
could
not
complain

It
be
as
if
I
have
pray
that
another
should
lose
and
I
should
win

and
I
have
win
,
I
know
it
all

guilty

when
we
be
on
the
sea

I
lie
awake
at
night
in
the
cabin

I
sometimes
feel

everything
I
have
do
lie
open
without

nothing

how
could
anything
be

be
God
's
that
have
enter
into
me
,
and
even
the
stillness
 
<EOS>
everything
hold
a
punishment
for
me
 
everything
<EOS>
but
you
.
<EOS>
I
always
think
that
you
would
not
want
me
to
be
punish
 
you
would
have
try
and
help
me
to
be
well
.
<EOS>
and
only
think
of
that
help
me
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
change
 
<EOS>
you
will
not
want
to
punish
me
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
again
a
sob
have
rise
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
forbid
!
"
<EOS>
groan
Deronda
.
<EOS>
but
he
sit
motionless
.
  
<EOS>
this
long
wander
with
the
conscious
-
stricken
one
over
her
past
be
difficult
to
bear
,
but
he
dare
not
again
urge
her
with
a
question
.
<EOS>
He
must
let
her
mind
follow
its
own
need
.
<EOS>
She
unconsciously
leave
interval
in
her
retrospect
,
not
clearly
distinguish
between
what
she
say
and
what
she
have
only
an
inward
vision
of
.
<EOS>
Her
next
word
come
after
such
an
interval
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
all
make
it
so
hard
when
I
be
force
to
go
in
the
boat
.
<EOS>
because
when
I
see
you
it
be
an
unexpected
joy
,
and
I
think
I
could
tell
you
everything
 
about
the
lock
-
up
drawer
and
what
I
have
not
tell
you
before
.
<EOS>
and
if
I
have
tell
you
,
and
know
it
be
in
your
mind
,
it
would
have
less
power
over
me
.
<EOS>
I
hope
and
trust
in
that
.
<EOS>
for
after
all
my
struggle
and
my
crying
,
the
hatred
and
rage
,
the
temptation
that
frighten
me
,
the
longing
,
the
thirst
for
what
I
dread
,
always
come
back
.
<EOS>
and
that
disappointment
 
when
I
be
quite
shut
out
from
speak
to
you
,
and
be
drive
to
go
in
the
boat
 
bring
all
the
evil
back
,
as
if
I
have
be
lock
in
a
prison
with
it
and
no
escape
.
<EOS>
oh
,
it
seem
so
long
ago
now
since
I
step
into
that
boat
!
<EOS>
I
could
have
give
up
everything
in
that
moment
,
to
have
the
fork
lightning
for
a
weapon
to
strike
him
dead
.
"
  
<EOS>
some
of
the
compress
fierceness
that
she
be
recall
seem
to
find
its
way
into
her
undertoned
utterance
.
<EOS>
after
a
little
silence
she
say
,
with
agitate
hurry
    
<EOS>
"
if
he
be
here
again
,
what
should
I
do
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
wish
him
here
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
can
not
bear
his
dead
face
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
coward
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
bear
contempt
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
go
away
 
go
and
wander
like
a
beggar
rather
than
to
stay
to
feel
like
a
fiend
.
<EOS>
but
turn
where
I
would
there
be
something
I
could
not
bear
.
<EOS>
sometimes
I
think
he
would
kill
_
me
_
if
I
resist
his
will
.
<EOS>
but
now
 
his
dead
face
be
there
,
and
I
can
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
suddenly
loose
Deronda
's
hand
,
she
start
up
,
stretch
her
arm
to
their
full
length
upward
,
and
say
with
a
sort
of
moan
    
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
a
cruel
woman
!
<EOS>
what
can
_
<EOS>
I
_
do
but
cry
for
help
?
<EOS>
_
I
_
be
sink

die
 
die
 
<EOS>
you
be
forsake
 
<EOS>
go
down
,
go
down
into
darkness
.
<EOS>
forsake
 
no
pity
 
<EOS>
_
I
_
shall
be
forsake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
sink
in
her
chair
again
and
break
into
sobs
.
<EOS>
even
Deronda
have
no
place
in
her
consciousness
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
He
be
completely
unmanned
.
<EOS>
instead
of
find
,
as
he
have
imagine
,
that
his
late
experience
have
dull
his
susceptibility
to
fresh
emotion
,
it
seem
that
the
lot
of
this
young
creature
,
whose
swift
travel
from
her
bright
rash
girlhood
into
this
agony
of
remorse
he
have
have
to
behold
in
helplessness
,
pierce
him
the
deep
because
it
come
close
upon
another
sad
revelation
of
spiritual
conflict
:
he
be
in
one
of
those
moment
when
the
very
anguish
of
passionate
pity
make
us
ready
to
choose
that
we
will
know
pleasure
no
more
,
and
live
only
for
the
stricken
and
afflict
.
<EOS>
He
have
rise
from
his
seat
while
he
watch
that
terrible
outburst
 
<EOS>
which
seem
the
more
awful
to
him
because
,
even
in
this
supreme
agitation
,
she
keep
the
suppress
voice
of
one
who
confess
in
secret
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
feel
impel
to
turn
his
back
toward
her
and
walk
to
a
distance
.
  
<EOS>
but
presently
there
be
stillness
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
have
open
to
the
sense
that
he
have
go
away
from
her
.
<EOS>
when
Deronda
turn
round
to
approach
her
again
,
he
see
her
face
bent
toward
him
,
her
eye
dilate
,
her
lip
part
.
<EOS>
She
be
an
image
of
timid
forlorn
beseech
 
too
timid
to
entreat
in
word
while
he
keep
himself
aloof
from
her
.
<EOS>
be
she
forsake
by
him
 
now
 
already
?
<EOS>
but
his
eye
meet
her
<EOS>
sorrowfully
 
meet
her
for
the
first
time
fully
since
she
have
say
,
"
You
know
I
be
a
guilty
woman
,
"
and
that
full
glance
in
its
intense
mournfulness
seem
to
say
,
"
I
know
it
,
but
I
shall
all
the
less
forsake
you
.
"
<EOS>
He
sit
down
by
her
side
again
in
the
same
attitude
 
without
turn
his
face
toward
her
and
without
again
take
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
once
more
Gwendolen
be
pierce
,
as
she
have
be
by
his
face
of
sorrow
at
the
Abbey
,
with
a
compunction
less
egoistic
than
that
which
urge
her
to
confess
,
and
she
say
,
in
a
tone
of
love
regret
    
<EOS>
"
I
make
you
very
unhappy
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
give
an
indistinct
"
<EOS>
oh
,
"
just
shrink
together
and
change
his
attitude
a
little
.
<EOS>
then
he
have
gather
resolution
enough
to
say
clearly
,
"
there
be
no
question
of
be
happy
or
unhappy
.
<EOS>
what
I
most
desire
at
this
moment
be
what
will
most
help
you
.
<EOS>
tell
me
all
you
feel
it
<EOS>
a
relief
to
tell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
devote
as
these
word
be
,
they
widen
his
spiritual
distance
from
her
,
and
she
feel
it
more
difficult
to
speak
:
she
have
a
vague
need
of
get
nearer
to
that
compassion
which
seem
to
be
regard
her
from
a
halo
of
superiority
,
and
the
need
turn
into
an
impulse
to
humble
herself
more
.
<EOS>
She
be
ready
to
throw
herself
on
her
knee
before
him
;
but
no
 
her
wonderfully
mixed
consciousness
hold
check
on
that
impulse
,
and
she
be
keep
silent
and
motionless
by
the
pressure
of
oppose
need
.
<EOS>
Her
stillness
make
Deronda
at
last
<EOS>
say
    
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
be
too
weary
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
go
away
,
and
come
again
whenever
you
wish
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
Gwendolen
 
<EOS>
the
dread
of
his
leave
her
bring
back
her
power
of
speech
.
<EOS>
She
go
on
with
her
low
-
toned
eagerness
,
"
I
want
to
tell
you
what
it
be
that
come
over
me
in
that
boat
.
<EOS>
I
be
full
of
rage
at
be
oblige
to
go
 
full
of
rage
 
and
I
could
do
nothing
but
sit
there
like
a
galley
slave
.
<EOS>
and
then
we
get
away
 
out
of
the
port
 
into
the
deep
 
and
everything
be
still
 
<EOS>
and
we
never
look
at
each
other
,
only
he
speak
to
order
me
 
and
the
very
light
about
me
<EOS>
seem
to
hold
me
a
prisoner
and
force
me
to
sit
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
It
come
over
me
that
when
I
be
a
child
I
use
to
fancy
sailing
away
into
a
world
where
people
be
not
force
to
live
with
any
one
they
do
not
like
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
my
father
-
in
-
law
to
come
home
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
I
think
,
just
the
opposite
have
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
step
into
a
boat
,
and
my
life
be
a
sailing
and
sail
away
 
glide
on
and
no
help
 
always
into
solitude
with
_
him
_
,
away
from
deliverance
.
<EOS>
and
because
I
feel
more
helpless
than
ever
,
my
thought
go
out
over
bad
thing
 
<EOS>
I
long
for
bad
thing
 
<EOS>
I
have
cruel
wish
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
impossible
way
of
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
to
die
myself
;
I
be
afraid
of
our
be
drown
together
.
<EOS>
if
it
have
be
any
use
I
should
have
pray
 
I
should
have
pray
that
something
may
befall
him
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
pray
that
he
may
sink
out
of
my
sight
and
leave
me
alone
.
<EOS>
I
know
no
way
of
kill
him
there
,
but
I
do
,
I
do
kill
him
in
my
thought
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
sink
into
silence
for
a
minute
,
submerge
by
the
weight
of
memory
which
no
word
could
represent
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
yet
,
all
the
while
I
feel
that
I
be
get
more
wicked
.
<EOS>
and
what
have
be
with
me
so
much
,
come
to
me
just
then
 
what
you
once
say
 
about
dread
to
increase
my
wrong
-
do
and
<EOS>
my
remorse
 
<EOS>
I
should
hope
for
nothing
then
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
like
a
writing
of
fire
within
me
.
<EOS>
get
wicked
be
misery
 
be
shut
out
forever
from
know
what
you
 
<EOS>
what
well
life
be

<EOS>
that
have
always
be
come
back
to
me
then
 
<EOS>
but
yet
with
a
despair
 
a
feeling
that
it
be
no
use
 
<EOS>
evil
wish
be
too
strong
.
<EOS>
I
remember
then
let
go
the
tiller
and
say
"
God
help
me
!
"
<EOS>
but
then
I
be
force
to
take
it
again
and
go
on
;
and
the
evil
longing
,
the
evil
prayer
come
again
and
blot
everything
else
dim
,
till
,
in
the
midst
of
them
 
I
do
not
know
how
it

only
know
that

my

outside
me

<EOS>
She
begin
to
speak
more
hurriedly
,
and
in
more
of
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
him
sink
,
and
my
heart
give
a
leap
as
if
it
be
go
out
of
me

<EOS>
I
think
I
do
not
move

I
keep
my
hand
tight

It
be
long
enough
for
me
to
be
glad

to
think
it
be
no

he
would
come
up
again

he

farther
off

the

It
be
all
like
lightning

the
rope

he
call
out
in
a
voice
 
<EOS>
not
his
own
 
<EOS>
I
hear
it
now
 
<EOS>
and
I
stoop
for
the
rope
 
<EOS>
I
feel
I
must
 
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
he
could
swim
,
and
he
would
come
back
whether
or
not
,
and
I
dread
him

<EOS>
that
be
in
my
mind
 
<EOS>
he
would
come
back

but
he
be
go
down
again
,
and
I
have
the
rope
in
my
hand
 
<EOS>
no
,
there
he
be
again
 
<EOS>
his
face
above
the
water
 
<EOS>
and
he
cry
again
 
<EOS>
and
I
hold
my
hand
,
and
my
heart
say
,
"
die
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
he
sink
;

I
feel
'
It
be

I
be
wicked

I
be
lose

I
have
the
rope
in

do
not

leap
away
from
myself

I
would
have
save
him
then

I
be
leap
from
my
crime

there
it
be
 
close
to
me
as
I
fall

there
be
the
dead
face
 
dead
,
dead
.

It
can
never

what
happen

You

it
all

It

"
  
<EOS>
She
sink
back
in
her
chair
,
exhaust
with
the
agitation
of
memory
and
speech
.
<EOS>
Deronda
feel
the
burden
on
his
spirit
less
heavy
than
the
foregoing
dread
.
<EOS>
the
word
"
guilty
"
have
hold
a
possibility
of
interpretation
bad
than
the
fact
;
and
Gwendolen
's
confession
,
for
the
very
reason
that
her
conscience
make
her
dwell
on
the
determine
power
of
her
evil
thought
,
convince
him
the
more
that
there
have
be
throughout
a
counterbalance
struggle
of
her
well
will
.
<EOS>
It
seem
almost
certain
that
her
murderous
thought
have
have
no
outward
effect
 
that
,
quite
apart
from
it
,
the
death
be
inevitable
.
<EOS>
still
,
a
question
as
to
the
outward
effectiveness
of
a
criminal
desire
dominant
enough
to
impel
even
a
momentary
act
,
can
not
alter
our
judgment
of
the
desire
;
and
Deronda
shrink
from
put
that
question
forward
in
the
first
instance
.
<EOS>
He
hold
it
likely
that
Gwendolen
's
remorse
aggravate
her
inward
guilt
,
and
that
she
give
the
character
of
decisive
action
to
what
have
be
an
inappreciably
instantaneous
glance
of
desire
.
<EOS>
but
her
remorse
be
the
precious
sign
of
a
recoverable
nature
;
it
be
the
culmination
of
that
self
-
disapproval
which
have
be
the
awakening
of
a
new
life
within
her
;
it
mark
her
off
from
the
criminal
whose
only
regret
be
failure
in
secure
their
evil
wish
.
<EOS>
Deronda
could
not
utter
one
word
to
diminish
that
sacred
aversion
to
her
bad
self
 
<EOS>
that
thorn
-
pressure
which
must
come
with
the
crowning
of
the
sorrowful
better
,
suffer
because
of
the
bad
.
<EOS>
all
this
mingle
thought
and
feeling
keep
him
silent
;
speech
be
too
momentous
to
be
venture
on
rashly
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
word
of
comfort
that
do
not
carry
some
sacrilege
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
open
his
lip
to
speak
,
he
could
only
have
echo
,
"
It
can
never
be
alter
 
<EOS>
it
remain
unaltered
,
to
alter
other
thing
.
<EOS>
"
but
he
be
silent
and
motionless
 
<EOS>
he
do
not
know
how
long
 
before
he
turn
to
look
at
her
,
and
see
her
sink
back
with
closed
eye
,
like
a
lost
,

It

with
a
deep
melancholy
in
her
expression

approach

pass
into
an

timidity

She
do
not

then
,
"
Will

He
place
himself
by

side

see
that
she
turn
to
him
with
that
indefinable
expression

imply
a
wish

say
something

he
wait
for
her
to

again
she
look
toward

silently
,
and
again
turn
with
the

which
yet
do
not

in

there

some
fear

Deronda
,
wish

avert

presently
he
hear
her
cry
imploringly

She
be
so
still
during

pause
that
she
seem
to
be
hold
her
breath
before

I
go
away

with

with

,
like

have
the
unintentional
effect

make
his

seem
more
personal

He
continue
to

both
immediate

on

it
be
under
their
influence
that
,
after
a
moment
's
silence

he

Deronda
could
see

to
that
quiet
recurrence

those
of
hunger
and
the

<EOS>
something
of
this
contrast
be
see
in
the
year
's
experience
which
have
turn
the
brilliant
,
self

confident
Gwendolen
Harleth
of
the
Archery
Meeting
into
the
crushed
penitent
impel
to
confess
her
unworthiness
where
it
would
have
be
her
happiness
to
be
hold
worthy
;
while
it
have
leave
her
family
in
Pennicote
without
deep
change
than
that
of
some
outward
habit
,
and
some
adjustment
of
prospect
and
intention
to
reduce
income
,
few
visit
,
and
fainter
compliment
.
<EOS>
the
rectory
be
as
pleasant
a
home
as
before
:
and
the
red
and
pink
peony
on
the
lawn
,
the
row
of
hollyhock
by
the
hedge
,
have
bloom
as
well
this
year
as
last
:
the
rector
maintain
his
cheerful
confidence
in
the
good
will
of
patron
and
his
resolution
to
deserve
it
by
diligence
in
the
fulfillment
of
his
duty
,
whether
patron
be
likely
to
hear
of
it
or
not
;
do
nothing
solely
with
an
eye
to
promotion
except
,
perhaps
,
the
writing
of
two
ecclesiastical
article
,
which
have
no
signature
,
be
attribute
to
some
one
else
,
except
by
the
patron
who
have
a
special
copy
send
them
,
and
these
certainly
know
the
author
but
do
not
read
the
article
.
<EOS>
the
rector
,
however
,
chew
no
poisonous
cud
of
suspicion
on
this
point
:
he
make
marginal
note
on
his
own
copy
to
render
them
a
more
interesting
loan
,
and
be
gratify
that
the
Archdeacon
and
other
authority
have
nothing
to
say
against
the
general
tenor
of
his
argument
.
<EOS>
peaceful
authorship
!
 
<EOS>
live
in
the
air
of
the
field
and
down
,
and
not
in
the
thrice
-
breathed
breath
of
criticism
 
bring
no
dantesque
leanness
;
rather
,
assist
nutrition
by
complacency
,
and
perhaps
give
a
more
suffusive
sense
of
achievement
than
the
production
of
a
whole
_
Divina
Commedia
_
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
the
father
's
recover
delight
in
his
favorite
son
,
which
be
a
happiness
outweigh
the
loss
of
eighteen
hundred
a
year
.
<EOS>
of
whatever
nature
may
be
the
hide
change
work
in
Rex
by
the
disappointment
of
his
first
love
,
it
be
apparently
quite
secondary
to
that
evidence
of
more
serious
ambition
which
date
from
the
family
misfortune
;
indeed
,
Mr.
Gascoigne
be
incline
to
regard
the
little
affair
which
have
cause
him
so
much
anxiety
the
year
before
as
an
evaporation
of
superfluous
moisture
,
a
kind
of
finish
to
the
baking
process
which
the
human
dough
demand
.
<EOS>
Rex
have
lately
come
down
for
a
summer
visit
to
the
rectory
,
bring
Anna
home
,
and
while
he
show
nearly
the
old
liveliness
with
his
brother

sister

he
continue
in
his
holiday
the
habit
of
the
eager
student
,
rise
early
in
the
morning
and
shut
himself
up
early
in
the
evening
to
carry
on
a
fix
course
of
study
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
repent
the
choice
of
the
law
as
a
profession
,
Rex
?
"
say
his
father

<EOS>
"
there
be
no
profession
I
would
choose
before
it

"
say
Rex

<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
end
my
life
as
a

draw
up

<EOS>
I
reverse
the
famous

I
should
say

let
who

"
You
will
have
to
stow
in
an
immense
amount
of
rubbish
,
I
suppose
 
that
be
the
bad
of
it
,
"
say
the
rector
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
that
law

rubbish
be
bad

any
other
sort

<EOS>
It
be
not
so
bad
as
the
rubbishy
literature
that
people
choke
their
mind
with

<EOS>
It
do
not
make
one
so
dull

<EOS>
Our

have
often

lawyer

<EOS>
any
orderly
way
of
look
at
thing

evidence
seem
to
me
better
than
a
perpetual
wash
of
odd
and
end
bear
on
nothing

particular

<EOS>
and
then
,
from
a
high
point
of
view
,
the
foundation
and
the
growth
of
law
make
the
most
interesting
aspect
of
philosophy

history

<EOS>
of
course
there
will
be
a
good
deal
that
be
troublesome

drudging

perhaps
exasperate

<EOS>

the
great
prize
in
life
can
not

I

that

well

my

the
good
augury
of
a
man

success
in
his

be
that
he

it
the
fine
in

world

I
fancy
it
so
with

work
when

Anna

have
much
to
tell
of

new
experience
,
and
the
acquaintance
she
have
make
in
London
,
and
when
on
her
first
visit
she
come
alone
,
many
question
be
ask
her
about
Gwendolen

house
in
Grosvenor
Square
,
what
Gwendolen
herself
have
say
,
and
what

else

<EOS>
have
Anna
be
to
see
Gwendolen
after
she
have
know
about

yacht

<EOS>
no
:
 
an
answer
which
leave
speculation
free
concern
everything
connect
with
that
interesting
unknown
vessel
beyond
the
fact
that
Gwendolen
have
write
just
before
she
set
out
to
say
that
Mr.
Grandcourt
and
she
be
go
yacht
on
the
Mediterranean
,
and
again
from
Marseilles
to
say
that
she
be
sure
to
like
the
yachting
<EOS>
,
the
cabin
be
very
elegant

and
she
would
probably
not
send
another
letter
till
she
have
write
quite
a
long
diary
fill
with
_

<EOS>
also
,
this
movement
of
Mr.

Mrs.

have
be
mention
in

so
that
altogether
this

<EOS>
but
when
Rex
be
present
,
the
girl
,
accord
to
instruction

never
start
this
fascinating
topic
,
and
to
-
day
there
have
only
be
animate
description
of
the
meyrick
and
their
extraordinary
jewish
friend
,
which
cause
some
astonished
questioning
from
mind
to
which
the
idea
of
live
Jews
,
out
of
a
book
,
suggest
a
difference
deep
enough
to
be
almost
zoological
,
as
of
a
strange
race
in
Pliny
's
natural
history
that
may
sleep
under
the
shade
of
its
own
ear
.
<EOS>
Bertha
could
not
imagine
what
Jews
believe
now
;
and
she
have
a
dim
idea
that
they
reject
the
Old
Testament
since
it
prove
the
New
;
Miss
Merry
think
that
Mirah
and
her
brother
could
"
never
have
be
properly

with

and
the
amiable
Alice
do
not

what
the
Jews
believe
,
she
be
sure
she

could
not
bear
them

"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
correct
her
by
say
that
the
great
jewish
family
who
be
in
society
be
quite
what
they
ought
to
be
both
in
London
and
Paris
,
but
admit
that
the
commoner
unconverte
Jews
be
objectionable
;
and
Isabel
ask
whether
Mirah
talk
just
as
they
do
,
or
whether
you
may
be
with
her
and
not
find
out
that
she
be
a
Jewess
.
  
<EOS>
Rex
,
who
have
no
partisanship

have
make
a
troublesome
acquaintance
with
the
minutia

ancient
history
in
the
form
of
"
cram
,
"
be
amuse
himself
by
playfully
exaggerate
the
notion
of
each
speaker
,
while
Anna
beg
them
all
to

look
up

she
remember
that

be

desirable
consequence

<EOS>
the
expected
promotion

legacy
be
the
common
type

a
temptation
which
make
speech

even
prayer
a
severe
avoidance

sometimes
raise
an
inward
shame

a
self

distaste
that
be
bad
than
any
other
form
of
unpleasant
companionship

<EOS>
in
Rex

nature
the
shame
be
immediate
,
and
overspread
like
an
ugly
light
all
the

of
what
may
come

thrust
themselves
in

substantial

before

vision

rise
the
impassable
vision

Gwendolen
rich

exalted

court

if
in
the
former
time

when
both
their
life
be
fresh

she
have
turn
from
his

with
repugnance

what
ground
be
there
for
supposing

would
be
more
open

these

last
year
he
have
bring
himself
into
a
state
of
calm
resolve
,
and
now
it
seem
that
three
word
have
be
enough
to
undo
all
that
difficult
work

cast
him
back
into
the
wretched
fluctuation

he
recognize

simply
perturb

hopeless

and
at
this
moment
the

an
untimeliness

Excuse
poor

it
be
not
much
more
than
eighteen
month

incalculable

those
of
small

which

make
one
person
plain
and
a

another
less
plain
and
more
foolish

another
plain
without

to
his
folly

and
leave
perhaps
the

without
obvious
change

<EOS>
everything
depend
 
not
on
the
mere
fact
of
disappointment
,
but
 
on
the
nature
affect
and
the
force
that
stir
it
.
<EOS>
in
Rex
's
well

endow
nature
,
brief
as
the
hope
have
be
,
the
passionate
stirring
have
go
deep
,
and
the
effect
of
disappointment
be
revolutionary
,
though
fraught
with
a
beneficent
new
order
which
retain
most
of
the
old
virtue
;
in
certain
respect
he
believe
that
it
have
finally
determine
the
bias
and
color
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
it
seem
that
his
inward
peace
be
hardly
more
than
that
of
republican
Florence
,
and
his
heart
no
better
than
the
alarm
-
bell
that
make
work
slack

busy

<EOS>
Rex
's
love
have
be
of
that
sudden
,
penetrate
,
cling
sort
which
the
ancient
know
and
sing
,
and
in
singing
make
a
fashion
of
talk
for
many
modern
whose
experience
have
by
no
mean
a
fiery
,
demonic
character
.
<EOS>
to
have
the
consciousness
suddenly
steep
with
another
's
personality
,
to
have
the
strong
inclination
possess
by
an
image
which
retain
its
dominance
in
spite
of
change
and
apart
from
worthiness
 
nay
,
to
feel
a
passion
which
cling
faster
for
the
tragic
pang
inflict
by
a
cruel
,
reorganize
unworthiness
 
be
a
phase
of
love
which
in
the
feeble
and
common
-
minded
have
a
repulsive
likeness
to
his
blind
animalism
insensible
to
the
high
sway
of
moral
affinity
or
heaven
-
light
admiration
.
<EOS>
but
when
this
attach
force
be
present
in
a
nature
not
of
brutish
unmodifiableness
,
but
of
a
human
dignity
that
can
risk
itself
safely
,
it
may
even
result
in
a
devotedness
not
unfit
to
be
call
divine
in
a
high
sense
than
the
ancient
.
<EOS>
phlegmatic
rationality
stare
and
shake
its
head
at
these
unaccountable
prepossession
,
but
they
exist
as
undeniably
as
the
wind
and
wave
,
determine
here
a
wreck
and
there
a
triumphant
voyage
.
  
<EOS>
this
sort
of
passion
have
nest
in
the
sweet
-
natured
,
strong
Rex
,
and
he
have
make
up
his
mind
to
its
companionship
,
as
if
it
have
be
an
object
supremely
dear
,
stricken
dumb
and
helpless
,
and
turn
all
the
future
of
tenderness
into
a
shadow
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
also
make
up
his
mind
that
his
life
be
not
to
be
pauperize
because
he
have
have
to
renounce
one
sort
of
joy
;
rather
,
he
have
begin
life
again
with
a
new
counting
-
up
of
the
treasure
that
remain
to
him
,
and
he
have
even
feel
a
release
of
power
such
as
may
come
from
cease
to
be
afraid
of
your
own
neck
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
here
he
be
pace
the
shrubbery
,
angry
with
himself
that
the
sense
of
irrevocableness
in
his
lot
,
which
ought
in
reason
to
have
be
as
strong
as
ever
,
have
be
shake
by
a
change
of
circumstance
that
could
make
no
change
in
relation
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
tell
himself
the
truth
quite
roughly
    
"
She
would
never
love
me
;
and
that
be
not
the
question
 
I
could
never
approach
her
as
a
lover
in
her
present
position
.
<EOS>
I
be
exactly
of
no
consequence
at
all
,
and
be
not
likely
to
be
of
much
consequence
till
my
head
be
turn
gray
.
<EOS>
but
what
have
that
to
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
She
would
not
have
me
on
any
term
,
and
I
would
not
ask
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
meanness
to
be
think
about
it
now
 
no
better
than
lurk
about
the
battle
-
field
to
strip
the
dead
;
but
there
never
be
more
gratuitous
sinning
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
gain
there
 
absolutely
nothing
.
<EOS>
then
why
can
not
I
face
the
fact
,
and
behave
as
they
demand
,
instead
of
leave
my
father
to
suppose
that
there
be
matter
he
can
not
speak
to
me
about
,
though
I
may
be
useful
in
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
last
thought
make
one
wave
with
the
impulse
that
send
Rex
walk
firmly
into
the
house
and
through
the
open
door
of
the
study
,
where
he
see
his
father
pack
a
traveling
-
desk
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
I
be
of
any
use
,
sir
?
"
say
Rex
,
with
rallied
courage
,
as
his
father
look
up
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
my
boy
;
when
I
be
go
,
just
see
to
my
letter
,
and
answer
where
necessary
,
and
send
me
word
of
everything
.
<EOS>
Dymock
will
manage
the
parish
very
well
,
and
you
will
stay
with
your
mother
,
or
,
at
least
,
go
up
and
down
again
,
till
I
come
back
,
whenever
that
may
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
hardly
be
very
long
,
sir
,
I
suppose
,
"
say
Rex
,
begin
to
strap
a
railway
rug
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
perhaps
bring
my
cousin
back
to
England
?
"
<EOS>
He
force
himself
to
speak
of
Gwendolen
for
the
first
time
,
and
the
rector
notice
the
epoch
with
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
depend
,
"
he
answer
,
take
the
subject
as
a
matter
-
of
-
course
between
them
.
"
<EOS>
perhaps
her
mother
may
stay
there
with
her
,
and
I
may
come
back
very
soon
.
<EOS>
this
telegram
leave
us
in
ignorance
which
be
rather
anxious
.
<EOS>
but
no
doubt
the
arrangement
of
the
will
lately
make
be
satisfactory
,
and
there
may
possibly
be
an
heir
yet
to
be
bear
.
<EOS>
in
any
case
,
I
feel
confident
that
Gwendolen
will
be
liberally
 
I
should
expect
,
splendidly
 
provide
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
must
have
be
a
great
shock
for
her
,
"
say
Rex
,
get
more
resolute
after
the
first
twinge
have
be
bear
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
be
a
devoted
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
doubt
of
it
,
"
say
the
rector
,
in
his
most
decide
manner
.
<EOS>
"
few
man
of
his
position
would
have
come
forward
as
he
do
under
the
circumstance
.
"
  
<EOS>
Rex
have
never
see
Grandcourt
,
have
never
be
speak
to
about
him
by
any
one
of
the
family
,
and
know
nothing
of
Gwendolen
's
flight
from
her
suitor
to
Leubronn
.
<EOS>
He
only
know
that
Grandcourt
,
be
very
much
in
love
with
her
,
have
make
her
an
offer
in
the
first
week
of
her
sudden
poverty
,
and
have
behave
very
handsomely
in
provide
for
her
mother
and
sister
.
<EOS>
that
be
all
very
natural
and
what
Rex
himself
would
have
like
to
do
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
have
be
a
lucky
fellow
,
and
have
have
some
happiness
before
he
get
drown
.
<EOS>
yet
Rex
wonder
much
whether
Gwendolen
have
be
in
love
with
the
successful
suitor
,
or
have
only
forborne
to
tell
him
that
she
hate

SHAKESPEARE
.
   
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
be
not
so
prompt
in
start
for
Genoa
as
Mr.
Gascoigne
have
be
,
and
Deronda
on
all
account
would
not
take
his
departure
until
he
have
see
the
baronet
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
only
Grandcourt
's
death
,
but
also
the
late
crisis
in
his
own
life
to
make
reason
why
his
old
friend
would
desire
to
have
the
unrestrained
communication
of
speech
with
him
,
for
in
writing
he
have
not
feel
able
to
give
any
detail
concern
the
mother
who
have
come
and
go
like
an
apparition
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
till
the
fifth
evening
that
Deronda
,
accord
to
telegram
,
wait
for
Sir
Hugo
at
the
station
,
where
he
be
to
arrive
between
eight
and
nine
;
and
while
he
be
look
forward
to
the
sight
of
the
kind
,
familiar
face
,
which
be
part
of
his
early
memory
,
something
like
a
smile
,
in
spite
of
his
late
tragic
experience
,
may
have
be
detect
in
his
eye
and
the
curve
of
his
lip
at
the
idea
of
Sir
Hugo
's
pleasure
in
be
now
master
of
his
estate
,
able
to
leave
them
to
his
daughter
,
or
at
least
 
accord
to
a
view
of
inheritance
which
have
just
be
strongly
impressed
on
Deronda
's
imagination
 
to
take
makeshift
feminine
offspring
as
intermediate
to
a
satisfactory
heir
in
a
grandson
.
<EOS>
We
should
be
churlish
creature
if
we
could
have
no
joy
in
our
fellow
-
mortal
'
joy
,
unless
it
be
in
agreement
with
our
theory
of
righteous
distribution
and
our
high
ideal
of
human
good
:
what
sour
corner
our
mouth
would
get
 
our
eye
,
<EOS>
what
frozen
glance
!
<EOS>
and
all
the
while
our
own
possession
and
desire
would
not
exactly
adjust
themselves
to
our
ideal
.
<EOS>
We
must
have
some
comradeship
with
imperfection
;
and
it
be
,
happily
,
possible
to
feel
gratitude
even
where
we
discern
a
mistake
that
may
have
be
injurious
,
the
vehicle
of
the
mistake
be
an
affectionate
intention
prosecute
through
a
life
-
time
of
kindly
office
.
<EOS>
Deronda
's
feeling
and
judgment
be
strongly
against
the
action
of
Sir
Hugo
in
make
himself
the
agent
of
a
falsity
 
<EOS>
yes
,
a
falsity
:
he
could
give
no
milder
name
to
the
concealment
under
which
he
have
be
rear
.
<EOS>
but
the
baronet
have
probably
have
no
clear
knowledge
concern
the
mother
's
breach
of
trust
,
and
with
his
light
,
easy
way
of
take
life
,
have
hold
it
a
reasonable
preference
in
her
that
her
son
should
be
make
an
english
gentleman
,
see
that
she
have
the
eccentricity
of
not
care
to
part
from
her
child
,
and
be
to
him
as
if
she
be
not
.
<EOS>
Daniel
's
affectionate
gratitude
toward
Sir
Hugo
make
him
wish
to
find
ground
of
excuse
rather
than
blame
;
for
it
be
as
possible
to
be
rigid
in
principle
and
tender
in
blame
,
as
it
be
to
suffer
from
the
sight
of
thing
hang
awry
,
and
yet
to
be
patient
with
the
hanger
who
see
amiss
.
<EOS>
if
Sir
Hugo
in
his
bachelorhood
have
be
beguile
into
regard
child
chiefly
as
a
product
intend
to
make
life
more
agreeable
to
the
full

grown
,
whose
convenience
alone
be
to
be
consult
in
the
disposal
of
them
 
why
,
he
have
share
an
assumption
which
,
if
not
formally
avow
,
be
massively
act
on
at
that
date
of
the
world
's

and
Deronda
,
with
all
his
keen
memory
of
the
painful
inward
struggle
he
have
go
through
in
his
boyhood
,
be
able
also
to
remember
the
many
sign
that
his
experience
have
be
entirely
shut
out
from
Sir
Hugo
's
conception
.
<EOS>
ignorant
kindness
may
have
the
effect
of
cruelty
;
but
to
be
angry
with
it
as
if
it
be
direct
cruelty
would
be
an
ignorant
_
un_kindness
,
the
most
remote
from
Deronda
's
large
imaginative
lenience
toward
other
.
<EOS>
and
perhaps
now
,
after
the
search
scene
of
the
last
ten
day
,
in
which
the
curtain
have
be
lift
for
him
from
the
secret
of
life
unlike
his
own
,
he
be
more
than
ever
dispose
to
check
that
rashness
of
indignation
or
resentment
which
have
an
unpleasant
likeness
to
the
love
of
punish
.
<EOS>
when
he
see
Sir
Hugo
's
familiar
figure
descend
from
the
railway
carriage
,
the
life
-
long
affection
which
have
be
well
accustomed
to
make
excuse
,
flow
in
and
submerge
all
new
knowledge
that
may
have
seem
fresh
ground
for
blame
.
  
<EOS>
"
well

Dan
,
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
with
a
serious
fervor
,
grasp
Deronda
's
hand
.
<EOS>
He
utter
no
other
word
of
greeting
;
there
be
too
strong
a
rush
of
mutual
consciousness
.
<EOS>
the
next
thing
be
to
give
order
to
the
courier
,
and
then
to
propose
walk
slowly
in
,
the
mild
evening
,
there
be
no
hurry
to
get
to
the
hotel

<EOS>
"
I
have
take
my

easily

as
he
and
Deronda
come
out
under
the
starlight
,
which
be
still
faint
with
the
linger
sheen
of
day
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
hurry
in
set
off
,
because
I
want
to
inquire
into
thing
a
little
,

so
I
get
sight
of
your
letter
to
Lady
Mallinger
before
I
start

now
,
how
be
the

from
what
Mr.

say

I
conclude
not

<EOS>
He
speak
as
if
it
be
a
question
whether
the
widow
would
have
the
estate
for
her
life

<EOS>

It
will
not

much
of
a
wrench

I
fancy

this
loss
of
the
husband

"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
look
round
at
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
suddenness
of
the
death
have
be
a
great
blow
to
her
,
"
say
Deronda
,
quietly
evade
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
Grandcourt
give
her
any
notion
what
be
the
provision
of
his
will
?
"
say
Sir
Hugo
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
what
they
be

sir

"
parry
Deronda

<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
do
,
"
say
the
baronet
,
quickly

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Gad
!
<EOS>
if
there
be
no
prospect
of
a
legitimate
heir
,
he
have
leave
everything
to
a
boy
he
have
by
a
Mrs.
Glasher
;
you
know
nothing
about
the
affair
,
I
suppose
,
but
she
be
a
sort
of
wife
to
him
for
a
good
many
year
,
and
there
be
three
old
child
 
girl
.
<EOS>
the
boy
be
to
take
his
father

name

he
be
Henleigh
already

he
be
to
be
Henleigh
Mallinger
Grandcourt

<EOS>
the
Mallinger
will
be
of
no
use
to
him

I
be
happy
to
say
;

the

dog
will
have
more
than
enough
with
his
fourteen
year
'
minority
 
<EOS>
no

fill

be
to
put
up
with
a
poor
two
thousand
a
year
and
the
house
at
Gadsmere
 
a
nice
kind
of
banishment
for
her
if
she
choose
to
shut
herself
up
there
,
which
I
do
not
think
she
will
.
<EOS>
the
boy
's
mother
have
be
live
there
of
late
year
.
<EOS>
I
be
perfectly
disgust
with
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
I
be
oblige
to
think
the
well
of
him
because
he
be
drown
,
though
,
so
far
as
my
affair
be
concern
,
nothing
in
his
life
become
him
like
the
leave
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
my
opinion
he
do
wrong
when
he
marry
this
wife
 
not
in
leave
his
estate
to
the
son
,
"
say
Deronda
,
rather
dryly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
nothing
against
his
leave
the
land
to
the
lad
,
"
say
Sir
Hugo
;
"
<EOS>
but
since
he
have
marry
this
girl
he
ought
to
have
give
her
a
handsome
provision
,
such
as
she
could
live
on
in
a
style
fit
to
the
rank
he
have
raise
her
to
.
<EOS>
She
ought
to
have
have
four
or
five
thousand
a
year
and
the
London
house
for
her
life
;
that
be
what
I
should
have
do
for
her
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
as
she
be
penniless
,
her
friend
could
not
stand
out
for
a
settlement
,
else
it
be
ill
trusting
to
the
will
a
man
may
make
after
he
be
married
.
<EOS>
even
a
wise
man
generally
let
some
folly
ooze
out
of
him
in
his
will
 
<EOS>
my
father
do
,
I
know
;
and
if
a
fellow
have
any
spite
or
tyranny
in
him
,
he
be
likely
to
bottle
off
a
good
deal
for
keep
in
that
sort
of
document
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
clear
<EOS>
Grandcourt
mean
that
his
death
should
put
an
extinguisher
on
his
wife
,
if
she
bear
him
no
heir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
,
in
the
other
case
,
I
suppose
everything
would
have
be
reverse
 
illegitimacy
would
have
have
the
extinguisher
?
"
say
Deronda
,
with
some
scorn
.
  
<EOS>
"
precisely
 
Gadsmere
and
the
two
thousand
.
<EOS>
It
be
queer
.
<EOS>
one
nuisance
be
that
Grandcourt
have
make
me
an
executor
;
but
see
he
be
the
son
of
my
only
brother
,
I
can
not
refuse
to
act
.
<EOS>
and
I
shall
mind
it
less
if
I
can
be
of
any
use
to
the
widow
.
<EOS>
Lush
think
she
be
not
in
ignorance
about
the
family
under
the
rose
,
and
the
purport
of
the
will
.
<EOS>
He
hint
that
there
be
no
very
good
understanding
between
the
couple
.
<EOS>
but
I
fancy
you
be
the
man
who
know
most
about
what
Mrs.
Grandcourt
feel
or
do
not
feel
 
eh
,
Dan
?
"
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
do
not
put
this
question
with
his
usual
jocoseness
,
but
rather
with
a
lower
tone
of
interested
inquiry
;
and
Deronda
feel
that
any
evasion
would
be
misinterpret
.
<EOS>
He
answer
gravely
    
"
She
be
certainly
not
happy
.
<EOS>
They
be
unsuite
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
but
as
to
the
disposal
of
the
property
 
from
all
I
have
see
of
her
,
I
should
predict
that
she
will
be
quite
contented
with
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
she
be
not
much
like
the
rest
of
her
sex
;
that
be
all
I
can
say
,
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
with
a
slight
shrug
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
however
,
she
ought
to
be
something
extraordinary
,
for
there
must
be
an
entanglement
between
your
horoscope
and
her
 
<EOS>
eh
?
<EOS>
when
that
tremendous
telegram
come
,
the
first
thing
Lady
Mallinger
say
be
,
"
how
very
strange
that
it
should
be
Daniel
who
send
it
!
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
have
something
of
the
same
sort
in
my
own
life
.
<EOS>
I
be
once
at
a
foreign
hotel
where
a
lady
have
be
leave
by
her
husband
without
money
.
<EOS>
when
I
hear
of
it
,
and
come
forward
to
help
her
,
who
should
she
be
but
an
early
flame
of
mine
,
who
have
be
fool
enough
to
marry
an
austrian
baron
with
a
long
mustache
and
short
affection
?
<EOS>
but
it
be
an
affair
of
my
own
that
call
me
there
 
nothing
to
do
with
knight
-
errantry
,
any
more
than
you
come
to
Genoa
<EOS>
have
to
do
with
the
Grandcourts
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
silence
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
have
begin
to
talk
of
the
Grandcourts
as
the
less
difficult
subject
between
himself
and
Deronda
;
but
they
be
both
wish
to
overcome
a
reluctance
to
perfect
frankness
on
the
event
which
touch
their
relation
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
Deronda
feel
that
his
letter
,
after
the
first
interview
with
his
mother
,
have
be
rather
a
thickening
than
a
breaking
of
the
ice
,
and
that
he
ought
to
wait
for
the
first
opening
to
come
from
Sir
Hugo
.
<EOS>
just
when
they
be
about
to
lose
sight
of
the
port
,
the
baronet
turn
,
and
pause
as
if
to
get
a
last
view
,
say
in
a
tone
of
more
serious
feeling
 
"
<EOS>
and
about
the
main
business
of
your
come
to
Genoa
,
Dan
?
<EOS>
You
have
not
be
deeply
pain
by
anything
you
have
learn
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
that
you
feel
need
change
your
position
in
any
way
?
<EOS>
You
know
,
whatever
happen
to
you
must
always
be
of
importance
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
desire
to
meet
your
goodness
by
perfect
confidence
,
sir

"
say
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
can
not
answer
those
question
truly
by
a
simple
yes
<EOS>
or
no

<EOS>
much
that
I
have
hear
about
the
past
have
pain
me

<EOS>
and
it
have
be
a
pain
to
meet
and
part
with
my
mother
in
her
suffering
state
,
as
I
have
be
compel
to
do
,
but
it
be
no
pain
 
<EOS>
it
be
rather
a
clearing
up
of
doubt
for
which
I
be
thankful
,
to
know
my
parentage

<EOS>
as
to
the
effect
on

there
will
be
no
change

my
gratitude
to
you
,
sir

for
the
fatherly
care
and
affection
you
have
always
show
me

<EOS>
but
to
know
that
I
be
bear
a
Jew

may
have
a
momentous
influence
on
my
life

which
I
be
hardly
able
to
tell
you
of
at

"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
speak
the
last
sentence
with
a
resolve
that
overcome
some
diffidence
.
<EOS>
He
feel
that
the
difference
between
Sir
Hugo
's
nature
and
his
own
would
have
,
by
-
and
-
by
,
to
disclose
themselves
more
markedly
than
have
ever
yet
be
needful
.
<EOS>
the
baronet
give
him
a
quick
glance
,
and
turn
to
walk
on
.
<EOS>
after
a
few
moment
'
silence
,
in
which
he
have
review
all
the
material
in
his
memory
which
would
enable
him
to
interpret
Deronda
's
word
,
he
say
    
"
I
have
long
expect
something
remarkable
from
you
,
Dan

but
,
for
God
's
sake
,
do
not
go
into
any
eccentricity
!
<EOS>
I
can
tolerate
any
man
's
difference
of
opinion
,
but
let
him
tell
it
me
without
get
himself
up
as
a
lunatic
.
<EOS>
at
this
stage
of
the
world
,
if
a
man
want
to
be
take
seriously
,
he
must
keep
clear
of

<EOS>
do
not
misunderstand
me

<EOS>
I
be
not

you
of
set
up
any
lunacy

I

you
may
easily

You

I
be
sorry
for
them
too

so
far
as
company
go

it
be
a
bad
ground
of
selection
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
do
not
ask
you
to
anticipate
your
inclination
in
anything
you
have
to
tell
me
.
<EOS>
when
you
make
up
your
mind
to
a
course
that
require
money

I
have
some

now
I

England

<EOS>
"
I
must
go
first
to

away
a

perhaps
to

there
these

I
have
an

away

if
it
be
more
likely
now
than
before
that
something
may
happen
to
it

and
perhaps
I
be
the
more
uneasy
,
because
I
linger
after

instead
of
set
out
immediately

yet
I
can
not

say
Sir

with
a
flippancy
which
be
an
escape
of

vexation
hide
under

more
serious
speech

I
should
at

incline
to
treat
a

with
incivility
simply
because

Jew

<EOS>
You
can
understand
that
I

to
a
stranger
,
"
I
know
nothing

Kalonymos

up
his

his
eye

disgust

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
robbery
of
our
people
 
as
when
our
youth
and
maiden
be
rear
for
the
Roman
Edom

<EOS>
but
it
be
frustrated

<EOS>
I
have
frustrate
it

<EOS>
when
Daniel

<EOS>
when
Daniel
Charisi
be
a

<EOS>
and
I
be
a
lad
little
above
his

we
make
a
solemn
vow
always
to
be
friend

<EOS>
He
say
,
"
let
us
bind
ourselves
with
duty

as
if
we
be
son
of
the
same

<EOS>
"
that
be
his
bent
from
first
to
last
 
as
he
say
,
to
fortify
his
soul
with
bond
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
saying
of
his
,
"
let
us
bind
love
with
duty

duty
be
the
love
of
law

we
bind
ourselves

apart

the
bond
have
never
be

<EOS>
when

be
dead

they
seek
to
rob
him

they

him

me

rescue
that

him

restore
to
him
the
offspring

him
of

you
the
chest
forthwith

<EOS>
Kalonymos
leave
the
room
for
a
few
minute

and
return
with
a
clerk
who
carry
the
chest

set
it
down
on

floor

off

He

Deronda
the
monitory

slightly
suspicious
look
with
which
age
be
apt

commit
any

to

age
do
not
easily
distinguish
between
what
it
need
to

and
what
youth
need
to
know
-
distance
seeming
to
level
the
object
of
memory
;
and
keenly
active
as
Joseph
Kalonymos
show
himself
,
an
inkstand
in
the
wrong
place
would
have
hinder
his
imagination
from
get
to
Beyrout
:
he
have
be
use
to
unite
restless
travel
with
punctilious
observation

<EOS>
but
Deronda
's
last
sentence
answer
its
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
-
you
would
perhaps
have
be
such
a
man
as
he
if
your
education
have
not
hinder

for
you
be
like
him
in
feature

not
altogether

young

He
have
an
iron
will
in

it
brace
up
everybody
about
him

when
he
be
quite
young
he
have
already

one
deep
upright
line

none

<EOS>
Daniel
Charisi
use
to
say
,
"
well

a

than
a
wavering

better

yet
his

say
Deronda

with

excuse
for
indecision
 
that
it
come
from
know
too
much

<EOS>
"
narrow

<EOS>
no

"

Kalonymos

shake
his

from
his
childhood
upward
,
he
drink
in
learn
as
easily
as
the

suck
up
water
.
<EOS>
but
he
early
take
to
medicine
and
theory
about
life
and
health
.
<EOS>
He
travel
to
many
country
,
and
spend
much
of
his
substance
in
seeing
and
know
.
<EOS>
what
he
use
to
insist
on
be
that
the
strength
and
wealth
of
mankind
depend
on
the
balance
of
separateness
and
communication
,
and
he
be
bitterly
against
our
people
lose
themselves
among
the
gentile
;
"
It
be
no
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
than
the
many
sort
of
grain
go
back
from
their
variety
into
sameness

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
mingle
all
sort
of
learning
;
and
in
that
he
be
like
our
arabic
writer
in
the
golden
time

<EOS>
We
study
together
,
but
he
go
beyond
me
.
<EOS>
though
we
be
bosom
friend
,
and
he
pour
himself
out
to
me
,
we
be
as
different
as
the
inside
and
outside
of
the
bowl
.
<EOS>
I
stand
up
for
two
notion
of
my
own
:
I
take
Charisi
's
saying
as
I
take
the
shape
of
the
tree
:
they
be
there
,
not
to
be
dispute
about
.
<EOS>
It
come
to
the
same
thing
in
both
of
us
;
we
be
both
faithful
Jews
,
thankful
not
to
be
Gentiles
.
<EOS>
and
since
I
be
a
ripe
man
,
I
have
be
what
I
be
now
,
for
all
but
age
-
loving
to
wander
,
love
transaction
,
love
to
behold
all
thing
,
and
care
nothing
about
hardship
.
<EOS>
charisi
think
continually
of
our
people
's
future
:
he
go
with
all
his
soul
into
that
part
of
our
religion
:
<EOS>
I
,
not
.
<EOS>
so
we
have
freedom
,
I
be
content
.
<EOS>
Our
people
wander
before
they
be
drive
.
<EOS>
young
man
when
I
be
in
the
East
,
I
lie
much
on
deck
and
watch
the
great
star
.
<EOS>
the
sight
of
them
satisfy
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
them
as
they
rise
,
and
hunger
not
to
know
more
.
<EOS>
Charisi
be
satisfied
with
no
sight
,
but
piece
it
out
with
what
have
be
before
and
what
would
come
after
.
<EOS>
yet
we
love
each
other
,
and
as
he
say
,
he
bind
our
love
with
duty
;
we
solemnly
pledge
ourselves
to
help
and
defend
each
other
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
I
have
fulfil
my
pledge
.
<EOS>
"
here
Kalonymos
rise

Deronda

rise
also

"
<EOS>
and
in
be
faithful
to
him
you
have
cause
justice
to
be
do
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
a
robbery
of
me
too
that
I
should
never
have
know
of
the
inheritance
he
have
prepare
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
thank
you
with
my
whole
soul
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
worthy
of
him
,
young
man
.
<EOS>
what
be
your
vocation
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
question
be
put
with
a
quick
abruptness
which
embarrass
Deronda
,
who
do
not
feel
it
quite
honest
to
allege
his
law
-
reading
as
a
vocation
.
<EOS>
He
answer
    
"
I
can
not
say
that
I
have
any
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
get
one
,
get
one
.
<EOS>
the
Jew
must
be
diligent
.
<EOS>
You
will
call
yourself
a
Jew
and
profess
the
faith
of
your
father
?
"
say
Kalonymos
,
put
his
hand
on
Deronda
's
shoulder
and
look
sharply
in
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
call
myself
a
Jew
,
"
say
Deronda
,
deliberately
,
become
slightly
paler
under
the
pierce
eye
of
his
questioner
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
will
not
say
that
I
shall
profess
to
believe
exactly
as
my
father
have
believe
.
<EOS>
Our
father
themselves
change
the
horizon
of
their
belief
and
learn
of
other
race
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
I
can
maintain
my
grandfather
's
notion
of
separateness
with
communication
.
<EOS>
I
hold
that
my
first
duty
be
to
my
own
people
,
and
if
there
be
anything
to
be
do
toward
restore
or
perfect
their
common
life
,
I
shall
make
that
my
vocation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
happen
to
Deronda
at
that
moment
,
as
it
have
often
happen
to
other
,
that
the
need
for
speech
make
an
epoch
in
resolve
.
<EOS>
His
respect
for
the
questioner
would
not
let
him
decline
to
answer
,
and
by
the
necessity
to
answer
he
find
out
the
truth
for
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
you
argue
and
you
look
forward
 
<EOS>
you
be
Daniel
Charisi
's
grandson
,

say
Kalonymos
,
add
a
benediction
in
Hebrew
.
  
<EOS>
with
that
they
part
;
and
almost
as
soon
as
Deronda
be
in
London
,
the
aged
man
be
again
on
shipboard
,
greet
the
friendly
star
without
any
eager
curiosity
.
      
<EOS>
"
within

the

but
more
than
all
be
 
Deronda
be
at
Genoa
in

he

her
bring
in

the

get

It
seem
they

be
a

I

from

eye
on

with
an
angry
gleam

in

deeply
-
shake
voice

indignation

Mr.

,
you

Mr.

would
not

so

why
will
you

he
be
lucky

why
will
you
use

about

what

evil

away

I

<EOS>
all
three
be
strike
with
the
sudden
transformation
.
<EOS>
Mirah
's
face
,
with
a
look
of
anger
that
may
have
suit
Ithuriel
,
pale
,
even
to
the
lip
that
be
usually
so
rich
of
tint
,
be
not
far
from
poor
Hans

who
sit
transfixed
,
blush
under
it
as
if
he
have
be
a
girl
,
while
he
say
,
nervously
    
"
I
be
a
fool
and
a
brute
,
and
I
withdraw
every
word
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
and
hang
myself
like
Judas
 
if
it
be
allowable
to
mention
him
.
"
<EOS>
even
in
Hans
's
sorrowful
moment
,
his
improvise
word
have
inevitably
some
drollery
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mirah
's
anger
be
not
appease
<EOS>
:
how
could
it
be
?
<EOS>
She
have
burst
into
indignant
speech
as
creature
in
intense
pain
bite
and
make
their
tooth
meet
even
through
their
own
flesh
,
by
way
of
make
their
agony
bearable
.
<EOS>
She
say
no
more
,
but
,
seat
herself
at
the
piano
,
press
the
sheet
of
music
before
her
,
as
if
she
think
of
begin
to
play
again
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
Mab
who
speak
,
while
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
face
seem
to
reflect
some
of
Hans
'
discomfort
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mirah
be
quite
right
to
scold
you
,
Hans
.
<EOS>
You
be
always
take
Mr.

in
vain

<EOS>
and
it
be
horrible
,
joke
in
that
way
about
his
marrying
Mrs.

<EOS>
man
's
mind
must
be
very
black

I
think

end
Mab
,
with
much
scorn
.
  
<EOS>
"
quite
true

my

"
say
Hans
,
in
a
low
tone
,
rise
and
turn
on
his
heel
to
walk
toward
the
back
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
better
go
on
,
Mab
;
you
have
not
give
your
full
time
to
the
lesson

Mirah
,
in
a
high
tone
than
usual
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Will
you
sing
this
again

shall
I

<EOS>
"
oh

please
sing
it
to

Mab

rejoice
to
take
no
more
notice
of
what
have
happen

<EOS>
and
Mirah
immediately
sing
_
Lascia
ch'io
pianga
_
,
give
forth
its
melodious
sobs
and
cry
with
new
fullness
and
energy
.
<EOS>
han
pause
in
his
walk
and
lean
against
the
mantel
-
piece
,
keep
his
eye
carefully
away
from
his
mother
's
.
<EOS>
when
Mirah
have
sing
her
last
note
and
touch
the
last
chord
,
she
rise
and
say
,
"
I
must
go
home
now
.
<EOS>
Ezra
expect
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
give
her
hand
silently
to
Mrs.
Meyrick
and
hang
back
a
little
,
not
daring
to
look
at
her
,
instead
of
kiss
her
,
as
usual
.
<EOS>
but
the
little
mother
draw
Mirah
's
face
down
to
hers
,
and
say
,
soothingly
,
"
God
bless
you
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mirah
feel
that
she
have
commit
an
offense
against
Mrs.
Meyrick
by
angrily
rebuke
Hans
,
and
mix
with
the
rest
of
her
suffering
be
the
sense
that
she
have
show
something
like
a
proud
ingratitude
,
an
unbecoming
assertion
of
superiority
.
<EOS>
and
her
friend
have
divine
this
compunction
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
Hans
have
seize
his
wide
-
awake
,
and
be
ready
to
open
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
Hans
,
"
say
Mab
,
with
what
be
really
a
sister
's
tenderness
cunningly
disguise
,
"
you
be
not
go
to
walk
home
with
Mirah
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
she
would
rather
not
.
<EOS>
You
be
so
dreadfully
disagreeable
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
go
to
take
care
of
her
,
if
she
do
not
forbid
me
,
"
say
Hans
,
open
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
Mirah
say
nothing
,
and
when
he
have
open
the
outer
door
for
her
and
close
it
behind
him
,
he
walk
by
her
side
unforbidden
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
the
courage
to
begin
speak
to
him
again
 
conscious
that
she
have
perhaps
be
unbecomingly
severe
in
her
word
to
him
,
yet
find
only
severer
word
behind
them
in
her
heart
.
<EOS>
besides
,
she
be
press
upon
by
a
crowd
of
thought
thrust
themselves
forward
as
interpreter
of
that
consciousness
which
still
remain
unaltered
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Hans
,
on
his
side
,
have
a
mind
equally
busy
.
<EOS>
Mirah
's
anger
have
wake
in
him
a
new
perception
,
and
with
it
the
unpleasant
sense
that
he
be
a
dolt
not
to
have
have
it
before
.
<EOS>
suppose
Mirah
's
heart
be
entirely
preoccupy
with
Deronda
in
another
character
than
that
of
her
own
and
her
brother
's
benefactor
;
the
supposition
be
attend
in
Hans
's
mind
with
anxiety
which
,
to
do
him
justice
,
be
not
altogether
selfish
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
strong
persuasion
,
which
only
direct
evidence
to
the
contrary
could
have
dissipate
,
and
that
be
that
there
be
a
serious
attachment
between
Deronda
and
Mrs.
Grandcourt
;
he
have
piece
together
many
fragment
of
observation
,
and
gradually
gather
knowledge
,
complete
by
what
his
sister
have
hear
from
Anna
Gascoigne
,
which
convince
him
not
only
that
Mrs.
Grandcourt
have
a
passion
for
Deronda
,
but
also
,
notwithstanding
his
friend
's
austere
self
-
repression
,
that
Deronda
's
susceptibility
about
her
be
the
sign
of
conceal
love
.
<EOS>
some
man
,
have
such
a
conviction
,
would
have
avoid
allusion
that
could
have
rouse
that
susceptibility
;
but
Hans
's
talk
naturally
flutter
toward
mischief
,
and
he
be
give
to
a
form
of
experiment
on
live
animal
which
consist
in
irritate
his
friend
playfully
.
<EOS>
His
experiment
have
end
in
satisfy
him
that
what
he
think
likely
be
true
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
any
susceptibility
Deronda
have
manifest
about
a
lover
's
attention
be
show
to
Mirah
,
Hans
take
to
be
sufficiently
account
for
by
the
allege
reason
,
namely
,
her
dependent
position
;
for
he
credit
his
friend
with
all
possible
unselfish
anxiety
for
those
whom
he
could
rescue
and
protect
.
<EOS>
and
Deronda
's
insistence
that
Mirah
would
never
marry
one
who
be
not
a
Jew
necessarily
seem
to
exclude
himself
,
since
Hans
share
the
ordinary
opinion
,
which
he
know
nothing
to
disturb
,
that
Deronda
be
the
son
of
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
.
  
<EOS>
thus
he
feel
himself
in
clearness
about
the
state
of
Deronda
's
affection
;
but
now
,
the
event
which
really
strike
him
as
concur
toward
the
desirable
union
with
Mrs.
Grandcourt
,
have
call
forth
a
flash
of
revelation
from
Mirah
 
<EOS>
a
betrayal
of
her
passionate
feeling
on
this
subject
which
have
make
him
melancholy
on
her
account
as
well
as
his
own
 
yet
on
the
whole
less
melancholy
than
if
he
have
imagine
Deronda
's
hope
fix
on
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
sublime
,
but
it
be
common
,
for
a
man
to
see
the
beloved
object
unhappy
because
his
rival
love
another
,
with
more
fortitude
and
a
milder
jealousy
than
if
he
see
her
entirely
happy
in
his
rival
.
<EOS>
at
least
it
be
so
with
the
mercurial
Hans
,
who
fluctuate
between
the
contradictory
state
of
feeling
,
wound
because
Mirah
be
wound
,
and
of
be
almost
oblige
to
Deronda
for
love
somebody
else
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
him
to
give
Mirah
any
direct
sign
of
the
way
in
which
he
have
understand
her
anger
,
yet
he
long
that
his
speechless
companionship
should
be
eloquent
in
a
tender
,
penitent
sympathy
which
be
an
admissible
form
of
woo
a
bruise
heart
.
  
<EOS>
thus
the
two
go
side
by
side
in
a
companionship
that
yet
seem
an
agitated
communication
,
like
that
of
two
chord
whose
quick
vibration
lie
outside
our
hearing
.
<EOS>
but
when
they
reach
the
door
of
Mirah
's
home
,
and
Hans
say
"
good
-
bye
,
"
put
out
his
hand
with
an
appealing
look
of
penitence
,
she
meet
the
look
with
melancholy
gentleness
,
and
say
,
"
Will
you
not
come
in
and
see
my
brother
?
"
  
<EOS>
Hans
could
not
but
interpret
this
invitation
as
a
sign
of
pardon
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
enough
understanding
of
what
Mirah
's
nature
have
be
work
into
by
her
early
experience
,
to
divine
how
the
very
strength
of
her
late
excitement
have
make
it
pass
more
quickly
into
the
resolute
acceptance
of
pain
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
say
,
"
if
you
will
let
me
,
"
and
they
go
in
together
,
half
his
grief
be
go
,
and
he
be
spin
a
little
romance
of
how
his
devotion
may
make
him
indispensable
to
Mirah
in
proportion
as
Deronda
give
his
devotion
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
this
be
quite
fair
,
since
his
friend
be
provide
for
accord
to
his
own
heart
;
and
on
the
question
of
Judaism
Hans
feel
thoroughly
fortify
:
 
who
ever
hear
in
tale
or
history
that
a
woman
's
love
go
in
the
track
of
her
race
and
religion
?
<EOS>
Moslem
and
jewish
damsel
be
always
attract
toward
Christians
,
and
now
if
Mirah
's
heart
have
go
forth
too
precipitately
toward
Deronda
,
here
be
another
case
in
point
.
<EOS>
Hans
be
will
not
to
make
merry
with
his
own
argument
,
to
call
himself
a
Giaour
,
and
antithesis
the
sole
clue
to
event
;
but
he
believe
a
little
in
what
he
laugh
at
.
<EOS>
and
thus
his
bird
-
like
hope
,
construct
on
the
light
principle
,
soar
again
in
spite
of
heavy
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
They
find
Mordecai
look
singularly
happy
,
hold
a
closed
letter
in
his
hand
,
his
eye
glow
with
a
quiet
triumph
which
in
his
emaciate
face
give
the
idea
of
a
conquest
over
assail
death
.
<EOS>
after
the
greeting
between
him
and
Hans
,
Mirah
put
her
arm
<EOS>
round
her
brother
's
neck
and
look
down
at
the
letter
in
his
hand
,
without
the
courage
to
ask
about
it
,
though
she
feel
sure
that
it
be
the
cause
of
his
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
letter
from
Daniel
Deronda
,
"
say
Mordecai
,
answer
her
look
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
brief
 
<EOS>
only
say
that
he
hope
soon
to
return
.
<EOS>
unexpected
claim
have
detain
him
.
<EOS>
the
promise
of
see
him
again
be
like
the
bow
in
the
cloud
to
me
,
"
continue
Mordecai
,
look
at
Hans
;
"
and
to
you
it
must
be
a
gladness
.
<EOS>
for
who
have
two
friend
like
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
while
Hans
be
answer
Mirah
slip
away
to
her
own
room
;
but
not
to
indulge
in
any
outburst
of
the
passion
within
her
.
<EOS>
if
the
angel
,
once
suppose
to
watch
the
toilet
of
woman
,
have
enter
the
little
chamber
with
her
and
let
her
shut
the
door
behind
them
,
they
would
only
have
see
her
take
off
her
hat
,
sit
down
and
press
her
hand
against
her
temple
as
if
she
have
suddenly
reflect
that
her
head
ache
;
then
rise
to
dash
cold
water
on
her
eye
and
brow
and
hair
till
her
backward
curl
be
full
of
crystal
bead
,
while
she
have
dry
her
brow
and
look
out
like
a
freshly
-
open
flower
from
among
the
dewy
tress
of
the
woodland
;
then
give
deep
sigh
of
relief
,
and
put
on
her
little
slipper
,
sit
still
after
that
action
for
a
couple
of
minute
,
which
seem
to
her
so
long
,
so
full
of
thing
to
come
,
that
she
rise
with
an
air
of
recollection
,
and
go
down
to
make
tea
.
  
<EOS>
something
of
the
old
life
have
return
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
use
to
remember
that
she
must
learn
her
part
,
must
go
to
rehearsal
,
must
act
and
sing
in
the
evening
,
must
hide
her
feeling
from
her
father
;
and
the
more
painful
her
life
grow
,
the
more
she
have
be
use
to
hide
.
<EOS>
the
force
of
her
nature
have
long
find
its
chief
action
in
resolute
endurance
,
and
to
-
day
the
violence
of
feeling
which
have
cause
the
first
jet
of
anger
have
quickly
transform
itself
into
a
steady
facing
of
trouble
,
the
well
-
know
companion
of
her
young
year
.
<EOS>
but
while
she
move
about
and
speak
as
usual
,
a
close
observer
may
have
discern
a
difference
between
this
apparent
calm
,
which
be
the
effect
of
restrain
energy
,
and
the
sweet
genuine
calm
of
the
month
when
she
first
feel
a
return
of
her
infantine
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
those
who
have
be
indulge
by
fortune
and
have
always
think
of
calamity
as
what
happen
to
other
,
feel
a
blind
incredulous
rage
at
the
reversal
of
their
lot
,
and
half
believe
that
their
wild
cry
will
alter
the
course
of
the
storm
.
<EOS>
Mirah
feel
no
such
surprise
when
familiar
Sorrow
come
back
from
brief
absence
,
and
sit
down
with
her
accord
to
the
old
use
and
will
not
.
<EOS>
and
this
habit
of
expect
trouble
rather
than
joy
,
hinder
her
from
have
any
persistent
belief
in
opposition
to
the
probability
which
be
not
merely
suggest
by
Hans
,
but
be
support
by
her
own
private
knowledge
and
long
-
grow
presentiment
.
<EOS>
an
attachment
between
Deronda
and
Mrs.
Grandcourt
,
to
end
in
their
future
marriage
,
have
the
aspect
of
a
certainty
for
her
feeling
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
no
fault
in
him
:
fact
have
order
themselves
so
that
there
be
a
tie
between
him
and
this
woman
who
belong
to
another
world
than
hers
and
Ezra
's
 
nay
,
who
seem
another
sort
of
be
than
Deronda
,
something
foreign
that
would
be
a
disturbance
in
his
life
instead
of
blend
with
it
.
<EOS>
well
,
well
 
<EOS>
but
if
it
could
have
be
defer
so
as
to
make
no
difference
while
Ezra
be
there
!
<EOS>
She
do
not
know
all
the
momentousness
of
the
relation
between
Deronda
and
her
brother
,
but
she
have
see
,
and
instinctively
feel
enough
to
forebode
its
be
incongruous
with
any
close
tie
to
Mrs.
Grandcourt
;
at
least
this
be
the
clothing
that
Mirah
first
give
to
her
mortal
repugnance
.
<EOS>
but
in
the
still
,
quick
action
of
her
consciousness
,
thought
go
on
like
change
state
of
sensation
unbroken
by
her
habitual
act
;
and
this
inward
language
soon
say
distinctly
that
the
mortal
repugnance
would
remain
even
if
Ezra
be
secure
from
loss
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
I
have
read
about
and
sing
about
and
see
act
,
be
happen
to
me
 
this
that
I
be
feel
be
the
love
that
make
jealousy
;
"
so
impartially
Mirah
sum
up
the
charge
against
herself
.
<EOS>
but
what
difference
could
this
pain
of
her
make
to
any
one
else
?
<EOS>
It
must
remain
as
exclusively
her
own
,
and
hide
,
as
her
early
yearning
and
devotion
to
her
lose
mother
.
<EOS>
but
unlike
that
devotion
,
it
be
something
that
she
feel
to
be
a
misfortune
of
her
nature
 
<EOS>
a
discovery
that
what
should
have
be
pure
gratitude
and
reverence
have
sink
into
selfish
pain
,
that
the
feeling
she
have
hitherto
delighted
to
pour
out
in
word
be
degrade
into
something
she
be
ashamed
to
betray
 
an
absurd
longing
that
she
who
have
receive
all
and
give
nothing
should
be
of
importance
where
she
be
of
no
importance
 
an
angry
feeling
toward
another
woman
who
possess
the
good
she
want
.
<EOS>
but
what
notion
,
what
vain
reliance
could
it
be
that
have
lain
darkly
within
her
and
be
now
burn
itself
into
sight
as
disappointment
and
jealousy
?
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
her
soul
have
be
steep
in
poisonous
passion
by
forget
dream
of
deep
sleep
,
and
now
flame
out
in
this
unaccountable
misery
.
<EOS>
for
with
her
wake
reason
she
have
never
entertain
what
seem
the
wildly
unfitting
thought
that
Deronda
could
love
her
.
<EOS>
the
uneasiness
she
have
feel
before
have
be
comparatively
vague
and
easily
explain
as
part
of
a
general
regret
that
he
be
only
a
visitant
in
her
and
her
brother
's
world
,
from
which
the
world
where
his
home
lie
be
as
different
as
a
portico
with
light
and
lacquey
be
different
from
the
door
of
a
tent
,
where
the
only
splendor
come
from
the
mysterious
inaccessible
star
.
<EOS>
but
her
feeling
be
no
longer
vague
:
the
cause
of
her
pain
 
<EOS>
the
image
of
Mrs.
Grandcourt
by
Deronda
's
side
,
draw
him
farther
and
farther
into
the
distance
,
be
as
definite
as
pincer
on
her
flesh
.
<EOS>
in
the
Psyche
-
mould
of
Mirah
's
frame
there
rest
a
fervid
quality
of
emotion
,
sometimes
rashly
suppose
to
require
the
bulk
of
a
Cleopatra
;
her
impression
have
the
thoroughness
and
tenacity
that
give
to
the
first
selection
of
passionate
feel
the
character
of
a
lifelong
faithfulness
.
<EOS>
and
now
a
selection
have
declare
itself
,
which
give
love
a
cruel
heart
of
jealousy
:
she
have
be
use
to
a
strong
repugnance
toward
certain
object
that
surround
her
,
and
to
walk
inwardly
aloof
from
them
while
they
touch
her
sense
.
<EOS>
and
now
her
repugnance
concentrate
itself
on
Mrs.
Grandcourt
,
of
whom
she
involuntarily
conceive
more
evil
than
she
know
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
bear
everything
that
use
to
be
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
bad
 
<EOS>
this
be
bad
,
 
<EOS>
I
use
not
to
have
horrible
feeling
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
poor
child
in
a
loud
whisper
to
her
pillow
.
<EOS>
strange
that
she
should
have
to
pray
against
any
feeling
which
concern
Deronda
!
  
<EOS>
but
this
conclusion
have
be
reach
through
an
evening
spend
in
attend
to
Mordecai
,
whose
exaltation
of
spirit
in
the
prospect
of
see
his
friend
again
,
dispose
him
to
utter
many
thought
aloud
to
Mirah
,
though
such
communication
be
often
interrupt
by
interval
apparently
fill
with
an
inward
utterance
that
animate
his
eye
and
give
an
occasional
silent
action
to
his
lip
.
<EOS>
one
thought
especially
occupy
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Seest
thou
,
Mirah
<EOS>
,
"
he
say
once
,
after
a
long
silence
,
"
the
_
Shemah
_
,
wherein
we
briefly
confess
the
divine
Unity
,
be
the
chief
devotional
exercise
of
the
Hebrew
;
and
this
make
our
religion
the
fundamental
religion
for
the
whole
world
;
for
the
divine
Unity
embrace
as
its
consequence
the
ultimate
unity
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
see
,
then
 
the
nation
which
have
be
scoff
at
for
its
separateness
,
have
give
a
bind
theory
to
the
human
race
.
<EOS>
now
,
in
complete
unity
a
part
possess
the
whole
as
the
whole
possess
every
part
:
and
in
this
way
human
life
be
tend
toward
the
image
of
the
Supreme
Unity
:
for
as
our
life
become
more
spiritual
by
capacity
of
thought
,
and
joy
therein
,
possession
tend
to
become
more
universal
,
be
independent
of
gross
material
contact
;
so
that
in
a
brief
day
the
soul
of
man
may
know
in
full
volume
the
good
which
have
be
and
be
,
nay
,
be
to
come
,
than
all
he
could
possess
in
a
whole
life
where
he
have
to
follow
the
creep
path
of
the
sense
.
<EOS>
in
this
moment
,
my
sister
,
I
hold
the
joy
of
another
's
future
within
me
:
a
future
which
these
eye
will
not
see
,
and
which
my
spirit
may
not
then
recognize
as
mine
.
<EOS>
I
recognize
it
now
,
and
love
it
so
,
that
I
can
lay
down
this
poor
life
upon
its
altar
and
say
:
"
burn
,
burn
indiscernibly
into
that
which
shall
be
,
which
be
my
love
and
not
me
.
"
<EOS>
dost
thou
understand
,
Mirah
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
little
,
"
say
Mirah
,
faintly
,
"
but
my
mind
be
too
poor
to
have
feel
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
yet
,
"
say
Mordecai
,
rather
insistently
,
"
woman
be
specially
frame
for
the
love
which
feel
possession
in
renounce
,
and
be
thus
a
fit
image
of
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
somewhere
in
the
later
_
Midrash
_
,
I
think
,
be
the
story
of
a
jewish
maiden
who
love
a
Gentile
king
so
well
,
that
this
be
what
she
do
:
 
<EOS>
she
enter
into
prison
and
change
clothe
with
the
woman
who
be
beloved
by
the
king
,
that
she
may
deliver
that
woman
from
death
by
die
in
her
stead
,
and
leave
the
king
to
be
happy
in
his
love
which
be
not
for
her
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
surpass
love
,
that
lose
self
in
the
object
of
love
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
,
Ezra
,
no
,
"
say
Mirah
,
with
low
-
toned
intensity
,
"
that
be
not
it
.
<EOS>
She
want
the
king
when
she
be
dead
to
know
what
she
have
do
,
and
feel
that
she
be
well
than
the
other
.
<EOS>
It
be
her
strong
self
,
want
to
conquer
,
that
make
her
die
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
be
silent
a
little
,
and
then
argue
    
"
that
may
be
,
Mirah
.
<EOS>
but
if
she
act
so
,
believe
the
king
would
never
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
make
the
story
so
in
your
mind
,
Ezra
,
because
you
be
great
,
and
like
to
fancy
the
great
that
could
be
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
it
be
not
really
like
that
.
<EOS>
the
jewish
girl
must
have
have
jealousy
in
her
heart
,
and
she
want
somehow
to
have
the
first
place
in
the
king
's
mind
.
<EOS>
that
be
what
she
would
die
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
sister
,
thou
hast
read
too
many
play
,
where
the
writer
delight
in
show
the
human
passion
as
indwell
demon

unmixed
with
the
relent
and
devout
element
of
the
soul

Thou

<EOS>
something
which
Mirah
have
lately
be
watch
for
as
the
fulfilment
of
a
threat
,
seem
now
the
continue
visit
of
that
familiar
sorrow
which
have
lately
come
back
,
bring
abundant
luggage
.
  
<EOS>
turn
out
of
Knightsbridge
,
after
singe
at
a
charitable
morning
concert
in
a
wealthy
house
,
where
she
have
be
recommend
by
Klesmer
,
and
where
there
have
be
the
usual
group
outside
to
see
the
depart
company
,
she
begin
to
feel
herself
dog
by
footstep
that
keep
an
even
pace
with
her
own
.
<EOS>
Her
concert
dress
be
simple
black
,
over
which
she
have
throw
a
dust
cloak
,
could
not
make
her
an
object
of
unpleasant
attention
,
and
render
walk
an
imprudence
;
but
this
reflection
do
not
occur
to
Mirah
:
another
kind
of
alarm
lie
uppermost
in
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
immediately
think
of
her
father
,
and
could
no
more
look
round
than
if
she
have
feel
herself
track
by
a
ghost
.
<EOS>
to
turn
and
face
him
would
be
voluntarily
to
meet
the
rush
of
emotion
which
beforehand
seem
intolerable
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
her
father
he
must
mean
to
claim
recognition
,
and
he
would
oblige
her
to
face
him
.
<EOS>
She
must
wait
for
that
compulsion
.
<EOS>
She
walk
on
,
not
quicken
her
pace
 
of
what
use
be
that
?
 
<EOS>
but
picture
what
be
about
to
happen
as
if
she
have
the
full
certainty
that
the
man
behind
her
be
her
father
;
and
along
with
her
picturing
go
a
regret
that
she
have
give
her
word
to
Mrs.
Meyrick
not
to
use
any
concealment
about
him
.
<EOS>
the
regret
at
last
urge
her
,
at
least
,
to
try
and
hinder
any
sudden
betrayal
that
would
cause
her
brother
an
unnecessary
shock
.
<EOS>
under
the
pressure
of
this
motive
,
she
resolve
to
turn
before
she
reach
her
own
door
,
and
firmly
will
the
encounter
instead
of
merely
submit
to
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
already
reach
the
entrance
of
the
small
square
where
her
home
lie
,
and
have
make
up
her
mind
to
turn
,
when
she
feel
her
embody
presentiment
get
closer
to
her
,
then
slip
to
her
side
,
grasp
her
wrist
,
and
say
,
with
a
persuasive
curl
of
accent
,
"
Mirah
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
pause
at
once
without
any
start
;
it
be
the
voice
she
expect
,
and
she
be
meet
the
expect
eye
.
<EOS>
Her
face
be
as
grave
as
if
she
have
be
look
at
her
executioner
,
while
his
be
adjust
to
the
intention
of
soothe
and
propitiate
her
.
<EOS>
once
a
handsome
face
,
with
bright
color
,
it
be
now
sallow
and
deep
-
line
,
and
have
that
peculiar
impress
of
impudent
suavity
which
come
from
court
favor
while
accept
disrespect
.
<EOS>
He
be
lightly
make
and
active
,
with
something
of
youth
about
him
which
make
the
sign
of
age
seem
a
disguise
;
and
in
reality
he
be
hardly
fifty
-
seven
.
<EOS>
His
dress
be
shabby
,
as
when
she
have
see
him
before
.
<EOS>
the
presence
of
this
unreverend
father
now
,
more
than
ever
,
affect
Mirah
with
the
mingle
anguish
of
shame
and
grief
,
repulsion
and
pity
 
more
than
ever
,
now
that
her
own
world
be
change
into
one
where
there
be
no
comradeship
to
fence
him
from
scorn
and
contempt
.
  
<EOS>
slowly
,
with
a
sad
,
tremulous
voice
,
she
say
,
"
It
be
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
run
away
from
me

child

"
<EOS>
he
begin
with
rapid
speech
which
be
mean
to
have
a
tone
of
tender
remonstrance
,
accompany
with
various
quick
gesture
like
an
abbreviate
finger

language
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
you
afraid
of

<EOS>
You
know
I
never

It

an

be
unable

Lapidoth
presently
find
himself
outside

consider
what

She
find

in

He
do
not

<EOS>
His
alarm
for

on

the
cause
of
her
distress
,
the
more
striking
from
the
novelty

but
Mirah

be
to
be
able

speak

tell
him
the
cause

presently
she
raise

Mirah

Her

<EOS>
imagine
the
difference
in
Deronda
's
state
of
mind
when
he
leave
England
and
when
he
return
to
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
set
out
for
Genoa
in
total
uncertainty
how
far
the
actual
bent
of
his
wish
and
affection
would
be
encourage
 
<EOS>
how
far
the
claim

to
him
may
draw
him
into
new
path
,
far
away
from

his

have
lately
be
pursue
with
a
consent
of
desire
which
uncertainty
make
dangerous

<EOS>
He
come
back
with
something
like
a
discover
charter
warrant
the
inherit
right
that
his
ambition
have
begin
to
yearn
for
:
he
come
back
with
what
be
well
than
freedom
 
with
a
duteous
bond
which
his
experience
have
be
prepare
him

even
if

attend
with
no

of
satisfy
a
secret
passionate
longing
never
yet
allow
to
grow
into
a
hope
.
<EOS>
but
now
he
dare
avow
to
himself
the
hide
selection
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
since
the
hour
when
he
leave
the
house
at
Chelsea
in
full
-
hearted
silence
under
the
effect
of
Mirah
's
farewell
look
and
word
 
their
exquisite
appealingness
stirring
in
him
that
deep
-
lay
care
for
womanhood
which
have
begin
when
his
own
lip
be
like
a

's
 
her
hold
on
his
feeling
have
help
him
to
be
blameless
in
word
and
deed
under
the
difficult
circumstance
we
know
of
.
<EOS>
there
seem
no
likelihood
that
he
could
ever
woo
this
creature
who
have
become
dear
to
him
amidst
association
that
forbid
woo
;
yet
she
have
take
her
place
in
his
soul
as
a
beloved
type
 
reduce
the
power
of
other
fascination
and
make
a
difference
in
it
that
become
deficiency
.
<EOS>
the
influence
have
be
continually
strengthen
.
<EOS>
It
have
lain
in
the
course
of
poor
Gwendolen
's
lot
that
her
dependence
on
Deronda
tend
to
rouse
in
him
the
enthusiasm
of
self
-
martyr
pity
rather
than
of
personal
love
,
and
his
less
constrained
tenderness
flow
with
the
full
stream
toward
an
indwell
image
in
all
thing
unlike
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
still
more
,
his
relation
to
Mordecai
have
bring
with
it
a
new
nearness
to
Mirah
which
be
not
the
less
agitating
because
there
be
no
apparent
change
in
his
position
toward
her
;
and
she
have
inevitably
be
bind
up
in
all
the
thought
that
make
him
shrink
from
an
issue
disappoint
to
her
brother
.
<EOS>
this
process
have
not
go
on
unconsciously
in
Deronda
:
he
be
conscious
of
it
as
we
be
of
some
covetousness
that
it
would
be
well
to
nullify
by
encourage
other
thought
than
to
give
it
the
insistency
of
confession
even
to
ourselves
:
but
the
jealous
fire
have
leap
out
at
Hans
's
pretension
,
and
when
his
mother
accuse
him
of
be
in
love
with
a
Jewess
any
evasion
suddenly
seem
an
infidelity
.
<EOS>
His
mother
have
compel
him
to
a
decisive
acknowledgment
of
his
love
,
as
Joseph
Kalonymos
have
compel
him
to
a
definite
expression
of
his
resolve
.
<EOS>
this
new
state
of
decision
work
on
Deronda
with
a
force
which
surprise
even
himself
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
release
of
all
the
energy
which
have
long
be
spend
in
self
-
checking
and
suppression
because
of
doubtful
condition
;
and
he
be
ready
to
laugh
at
his
own
impetuosity
<EOS>
when
,
as
he
near
England
on
his
way
from
Mainz
,
he
feel
the
remain
distance
more
and
more
of
an
obstruction
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
he
have
find
an
add
soul
in
find
his
ancestry
 
his
judgment
no
longer
wander
in
the
maze
of
impartial
sympathy
,
but
choose
,
with
that
partiality
which
be
man
's
good
strength
,
the
close
fellowship
that
make
sympathy
practical
 
exchange
that
bird
's
eye
reasonableness
which
soar
to
avoid
preference
and
lose
all
sense
of
quality
for
the
generous
reasonableness
of
draw
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
man
of
like
inheritance
.
<EOS>
He
want
now
to
be
again
with
Mordecai
,
to
pour
forth
instead
of
restrain
his
feeling
,
to
admit
agreement
and
maintain
dissent
,
and
all
the
while
to
find
Mirah
's
presence
without
the
embarrassment
of
obviously
seek
it
,
to
see
her
in
the
light
of
a
new
possibility
,
to
interpret
her
look
and
word
from
a
new
starting
-
point
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
greatly
alarm
about
the
effect
of
Hans
's
attention
,
but
he
have
a
presentiment
that
her
feeling
toward
himself
have
from
the
first
lain
in
a
channel
from
which
it
be
not
likely
to
be
divert
into
love
.
<EOS>
to
astonish
a
woman
by
turn
into
her
lover
when
she
have
be
think
of
you
merely
as
a
Lord
Chancellor
be
what
a
man
naturally
shrink
from
<EOS>
:
he
be
anxious
to
create
an
easy
transition
.
  
<EOS>
what
wonder
that
Deronda
see
no
other
course
than
to
go
straight
from
the
London
railway
station
to
the
lodging
in
that
small
square
in
Brompton
?
<EOS>
every
argument
be
in
favor
of
his
lose
no
time
.
<EOS>
He
have
promise
to
run
down
the
next
day
to
see
Lady
Mallinger
at
the
Abbey
,
and
it
be
already
sunset
.
<EOS>
He
wish
to
deposit
the
precious
chest
with
Mordecai
,
who
would
study
its
content
,
both
in
his
absence
and
in
company
with
him
;
and
that
he
should
pay
this
visit
without
pause
would
gratify
Mordecai
's
heart
.
<EOS>
hence
,
and
for
other
reason
,
it
gratify
Deronda
's
heart
.
<EOS>
the
strong
tendency
of
his
nature
be
rush
in
one
current
 
the
fervent
affectionateness
which
make
him
delight
in
meet
the
wish
of
being
near
to
him
,
and
the
imaginative
need
of
some
far
-
reach
relation
to
make
the
horizon
of
his
immediate
,
daily
act
.
<EOS>
It
have
to
be
admit
that
in
this
classical
,
romantic
,
world
-
historic
position
of
his
,
bring
as
it
be
from
its
hiding
-
place
his
hereditary
armor
,
he
wear
 
<EOS>
but
so
,
one
must
suppose
,
do
the
most
ancient
hero
,
<EOS>
whether
Semitic
or
Japhetic
 
the
summer
costume
of
his
contemporary
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
reflect
that
the
drab
tint
be
become
to
him
,
for
he
rarely
go
to
the
expense
of
such
thinking
;
but
his
own
depth
of
coloring
,
which
make
the
becomingness
,
get
an
add
radiance
in
the
eye
,
a
fleeting
and
return
glow
in
the
skin
,
as
he
enter
the
house
wonder
what
exactly
he
should
find
.
<EOS>
He
make
his
entrance
as
noiseless
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
evening
of
that
same
afternoon
on
which
Mirah
have
have
the
interview
with
her
father
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
,
penetrate
by
her
grief
,
and
also
the
sad
memory
which
the
incident
have
awaken
,
have
not
resume
his
task
of
sift
paper
:
some
of
them
have
fall
scatter
on
the
floor
in
the
first
moment
of
anxiety
,
and
neither
he
nor
Mirah
have
think
of
lay
them
in
order
again
.
<EOS>
They
have
sit
perfectly
still
together
,
not
know
how
long
;
while
the
clock
tick
on
the
mantelpiece
,
and
the
light
be
fade
,
Mirah
,
unable
to
think
of
the
food
that
she
ought
to
have
be
take
,
have
not
move
since
she
have
throw
off
her
dust
-
cloak
and
sit
down
beside
Mordecai
with
her
hand
in
his
,
while
he
have
lay
his
head
backward
,
with
closed
eye
and
difficult
breathing
,
look
,
Mirah
think
,
as
he
would
look
when
the
soul
within
him
could
no
longer
live
in
its
straitened
home
.
<EOS>
the
thought
that
his
death
may
be
near
be
continually
visit
her
when
she
see
his
face
in
this
way
,
without
its
vivid
animation
;
and
now
,
to
the
rest
of
her
grief
,
be
add
the
regret
that
she
have
be
unable
to
control
the
violent
outburst
which
have
shake
him
.
<EOS>
She
sit
watch
him
 
her
oval
cheek
pallid
,
<EOS>
her
eye
with
the
sorrowful
brilliancy
leave
by
young
tear
,
her
curl
in
as
much
disorder
as
a
just
-
awaken
child
's
 
watch
<EOS>
that
emaciate
face
,
where
it
may
have
be
imagine
that
a
veil
have
be
draw
never
to
be
lift
,
as
if
it
be
her
dead
joy
which
have
leave
her
strong
enough
to
live
on
in
sorrow
.
<EOS>
and
life
at
that
moment
stretch
before
Mirah
with
more
than
a
repetition
of
former
sadness
.
<EOS>
the
shadow
of
the
father
be
there
,
and
more
than
that
,
a
double
bereavement
 
of
one
live
as
well
as
one
dead
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
the
door
be
open
,
and
while
none
enter
,
a
well
-
know
voice
say
:
"
Daniel
Deronda
 
<EOS>
may
he
come
in
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
come
!
<EOS>
come
!
"
<EOS>
say
Mordecai
,
immediately
rise
with
an
irradiated
face
and
open
eye
 
apparently
as
little
surprised
as
if
he
have
see
Deronda
in
the
morning
,
and
expect
this
evening
visit
;
while
Mirah
start
up
blush
with
confused
,
half
-
alarm
expectation
.
  
<EOS>
yet
when
Deronda
enter
,
the
sight
of
him
be
like
the
clearness
after
rain
:
<EOS>
no
cloud
to
come
could
hinder
the
cherish
beam
of
that
moment
.
<EOS>
as
he
hold
out
his
right
hand
to
Mirah
,
who
be
close
to
her
brother
's
leave
,
he
lay
his
other
hand
on
Mordecai
's
right
shoulder
,
and
stand
so
a
moment
,
hold
them
both
at
once
,
utter
no
word
,
but
read
their
face
,
till
he
say
anxiously
to
Mirah
,
"
have
anything
happen
?
 
<EOS>
any
trouble
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
talk
not
of
trouble
now
,
"
say
Mordecai
,
save
her
from
the
need
to
answer
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
joy
in
your
face
 
<EOS>
let
the
joy
be
ours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
think
,
"
It
be
for
something
he
can
not
tell
us
.
"
<EOS>
but
they
all
sit
down
,
Deronda
draw
a
chair
close
in
front
of
Mordecai
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
,
"
he
say
,
emphatically
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
joy
which
will
remain
to
us

not
tell
you
the

abroad

because
 
never

clasp
hand
with
a
movement
that
seem
part
of
the
flash
from
Mordecai
's
eye
,
and
pass
through
Mirah
like
an
electric
shock

Deronda
go
on
without
pause
,
speak
from
Mordecai
's
mind
as
much
as
from
his
own

We
have
the

Our

<EOS>
Mordecai
's
answer
be
utter
in
Hebrew
,
and
in
no
more
than
a
loud
whisper
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
liturgical
word
which
express
the
religious
bond
:
"
Our
God
and
the
God
of
our
father

weight

too
strongly
on

winged
speech

usually
move
in
quick
adaptation
to
every
stirring
of
his
fervor

<EOS>
Mirah
fall
on
her
knee
by
her
brother
's
side
,
and
look
at
his
now
illuminate
face
,
which
have
just
before
be
so
deathly
.
<EOS>
the
action
be
an
inevitable
outlet
of
the
violent
reversal
from
despondency
to
a
gladness
which
come
over
her
as
solemnly
as
if
she
have
be
behold
a
religious
rite
.
<EOS>
for
the
moment
she
think
of
the
effect
on
her
own
life
only
through
the
effect
on
her
brother

"
and
it
be
not
only
that
I
be
a
Jew

go
on
,
enjoy
one
of
those
rare
moment
when
our
yearning
and
our
act
can
be
completely
one
,
and
the
real
we
behold
be
our
ideal
good
;
"
but
I
come
of
a
strain
that
have
ardently
maintain
the
fellowship
of
our
race
 
a
line
of
Spanish
Jews
that
have
bear
many
student
and
man
of
practical
power
.
<EOS>
and
I
possess
what
will
give
us
a
sort
of
communion
with
them
.
<EOS>
My
grandfather
,
Daniel
Charisi
,
preserve
manuscript
,
family
record
stretch
far
back
,
in
the
hope
that
they
would
pass
into
the
hand
of
his
grandson
.
<EOS>
and
now
his
hope
be
fulfil
,
in
spite
of
attempt
to
thwart
it
by
hide
my
parentage
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
possess
the
chest
contain
them
,
with
his
own
paper
,
and
it
be
down
below
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
leave
it
with
you
,
Mordecai
,
that
you
may
help
me
to
study
the
manuscript
.
<EOS>
some
of
them

I
can
read
easily
enough

those
in
spanish

Italian

,
I
think
,
Arabic

there
seem
to
be
latin

<EOS>
I
be
only
able
to
look
at
them
cursorily
while
I
stay
at
Mainz

<EOS>
We
will
study
them
together

"
  
Deronda
end
with
that
bright
smile
which
,
beam
out
from
the
habitual
gravity
of
his
face
,
seem
a
revelation
(
the
reverse
of
the
continual
smile
that
discredit
all
expression
)
.
<EOS>
but
when
this
happy
glance
pass
from
Mordecai
to
rest
on
Mirah
,
it
act
like
a
little
too
much
sunshine
,
and
make
her
change
her
attitude
.
<EOS>
She
have
kneel
under
an
impulse
with
which
any
personal
embarrassment
be
incongruous
,
and
especially
any
thought
about
how
Mrs.
Grandcourt
may
stand
to
this
new
aspect
of
thing
 
thought
which
make
her
color
under
Deronda
's
glance
,
and
rise
to
take
her
seat
again
in
her
usual
posture
of
crossed
hand
and
foot
,
with
the
effort
to
look
as
quiet
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Deronda
,
equally
sensitive
,
imagine
that
the
feeling
of
which
he
be
conscious
,
have
enter
too
much
into
his
eye
,
and
have
be
repugnant
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
be
ready
enough
to
believe
that
any
unexpected
manifestation
may
spoil
her
feeling
toward
him
 
and
then
his
precious
relation
to
brother
and
sister
would
be
mar
.
<EOS>
if
Mirah
could
have
no
love
for
him
,
any
advance
of
love
on
his
part
would
make
her
wretched
in
that
continual
contact
with
him
which
would
remain
inevitable
.
  
<EOS>
while
such
feeling
be
pulsate
quickly
in
Deronda
and
Mirah
,
Mordecai
,
see
nothing
in
his

have
there

for

It

to
the

<EOS>
It
be
you
who
have
give
shape
to
what
,
I
believe
,
be
an
inherit
yearning
 
<EOS>
the
effect
of
brooding
,
passionate
thought
in
many
ancestor
 
thought
that
seem
to
have
be
intensely
present
in
my
grandfather

<EOS>
suppose
the
steal
offspring
of
some
mountain
tribe
bring
up
in
a
city
of
the
plain
,
or
one
with
an
inherit
genius

bear
blind
 
<EOS>
the
ancestral
life
would
lie
within
them
as
a
dim
longing

unknown

the
spell

be

quiver
throughout
in
uneasy
mysterious
meaning

its
intricate

that

under
the
right
touch

give
music

<EOS>
something
like
that
,
I
think
,
have
be
my
experience

<EOS>
since
I
begin
to
read
and
know
,
I
have
always
long
for
some
ideal
task

in
which
I
may
feel
myself
the
heart

of
a

the

<EOS>
"
even
as
my
brother
that
feed
at
the
breast

"
say
Mordecai
,
fall
back
in
his
chair
with
a
look
of
exultant
repose
,
as
after
some
finish
labor
.
  
<EOS>
to
estimate
the
effect
of
this
ardent
outpoure
from
Deronda
we
must
remember
his
former
reserve
,
his
careful
avoidance
of
premature
assent
or
delusive
encouragement
,
which
give
to
this
decide
pledge
of
himself
a
sacramental
solemnity
,
both
for
his
own
mind
and
Mordecai
's
.
<EOS>
on
Mirah
the
effect
be
equally
strong
,
though
with
a
difference
:
she
feel
a
surprise
which
have
no
place
in
her
brother
's
mind
,
at
Deronda
's
suddenly
reveal
sense
of
nearness
to
them
:
<EOS>
there
seem
to
be
a
breaking
of
day
around
her
which
may
show
her
other
fact
unlike
her
foreboding
in
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
but
after
a
moment
's
silence
Mordecai
speak
again
    
<EOS>
"
It
have
begin
already
 
the
marriage
of
our
soul

<EOS>
It
wait
but
the
passing
away
of
this
body

and
then
they
who
be
betroth
shall
unite
in
a
strict
bond
,
and
what
be
mine
shall
be
thine

<EOS>
call
nothing
mine
that
I
have
write

Daniel

for
though
our
master
deliver
rightly
that
everything
should
be
quote
in
the
name
of
him
that
say
it
 
<EOS>
and
their
rule
be
good
 
<EOS>

it
do
not
exclude
the
willing
marriage
which
melt
soul
into
soul

make
think
fuller
as

be
inseparable

judge
what

I
give
my

to
pass
away
as
this
fleshly
body
will
pass

the

bear
again
from
our
full
soul

yours

<EOS>
"
You
must
not
ask
me
to
promise
that
,
"
say
Deronda
,
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
be
convince
first
of
special
reason
for
it
in
the
writing
themselves
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
too
backward
a
pupil
yet
.
<EOS>
that
blent
transmission
must
go
on
without
any
choice
of
ours

what
we

must
not

I
think
our

faithful
tradition
where
we
can
attain
it

and
so
you
would
insist
for
any
one

yourself

<EOS>
do
not
ask
me
to
deny
my
spiritual
parentage
,
when
I
be
find
the
clue
of
my
life
in
the
recognition
of
natural
parentage

<EOS>
"
I
will
ask
for
no
promise
till
you
see
the
reason
,
"
say
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
say
the
truth
:
I
would
obey
the
Master
's
rule
for
another

<EOS>
but
for
year
my
hope
,
nay
,
my
confidence

have
be
,
not
that
the
imperfect
image
of
my
thought

which
be
an
ill
-
shaped
work
of
the
youthful
carver
who
have
see
a
heavenly
pattern

tremble
in
imitate
the
vision
 
not
that
this
should
live

that
my
vision
and
passion
should
enter
into
yours
 
yea
,
into
yours

for
he
whom
I
long
for
afar

be
he
not
you

I
discern
as
mine
when
you
come
near
?
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
you
shall
judge
.
<EOS>
for
my
soul
be
satisfied

<EOS>
Mordecai
pause
,
and
then
begin
in
a
change
tone
,
revert
to
previous
suggestion
from
Deronda
's
disclosure
:
"
what
move
your
parent
   
?
"
<EOS>
but
he
immediately
check
himself
,
and
add
,
"
nay
,
I
ask
not
that
you
should
tell
me
aught
concern
other
,
unless
it
be
your
pleasure

<EOS>
"
  
"
some
time
 
gradually
 
you
will
know
all
,
"
say
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
but
now
tell
me
more
about
yourself
,
and
how
the
time
have
pass
since
I
go
away
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
there
have
be
some
trouble
.
<EOS>
Mirah
have
be
in
distress
about
something
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
look
at
Mirah
,
but
she
immediately
turn
to
her
brother
,
appeal
to
him
to
give
the
difficult
answer
.
<EOS>
She
hope
he
would
not
think
it
necessary
to
tell
Deronda
the
fact
about
her
father
on
such
an
evening
as
this
.
<EOS>
just
when
Deronda
have
bring
himself
so
near
,
and
identify
himself
with
her
brother
,
it
be
cut
to
her
that
he
should
hear
of
this
disgrace
cling
about
them
,
which
seem
to
have
become
partly
his
.
<EOS>
to
relieve
herself
she
rise
to
take
up
her
hat
and
cloak
,
think
she
would
go
to
her
own
room
:
perhaps
they
would
speak
more
easily
when
she
have
leave
them
.
<EOS>
but
meanwhile
Mordecai
say
    
"
to
-
day
there
have
be
a
grief
.
<EOS>
a
duty
which
seem
to
have
go
far
into
the
distance
,
have
come
back
and
turn
its
face
upon
us
,
and
raise
no
gladness
 
have
raise
a
dread
that
we
must
submit
to
.
<EOS>
but
for
the
moment
we
be
deliver
from
any
visible
yoke
.
<EOS>
let
us
defer
speak
of
it
as
if
this
evening
which
be
deepen
about
us
be
the
beginning
of
the
festival
in
which
we
must
offer
the
first
fruit
of
our
joy
,
and
mingle
no
mourning
with
them

"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
divine
the
hint
grief
,
and
leave
it
in
silence
,
rise
as
he
see
Mirah
rise
,
and
say
to
her
,
"
be
you
go
?
<EOS>
I
must
leave
almost
immediately
 
when
I
and
Mrs.
Adam
have
mount
the
precious
chest

I
have
deliver
the
key
to
Mordecai

Ezra

may
I
call
him

hear

"

please
call

Ezra

"
say
Mirah
,
faintly
,
feel
a
new
timidity
under
Deronda
's
glance
and
near
presence
.
<EOS>
be
there
really
something
different
about
him
,
or
be
the
difference
only
in
her
feeling
?
<EOS>
the
strangely
various
emotion
of
the
last
few
hour
have
exhaust
her
;
she
be
faint
with
fatigue
and
want
of
food
.
<EOS>
Deronda
,
observe
her
pallor
and
tremulousness
,
long
to
show
more
feeling
,
but
dare
not
.
<EOS>
She
put
out
her
hand
with
an
effort
to
smile
,
and
then
he
open
the
door
for
her
.
<EOS>
that
be
all
.
  
<EOS>
a
man
of
refined
pride
shrink
from
make
a
lover
's
approach
to
a
woman
whose
wealth
or
rank
may
make
them
appear
presumptuous
or
low
-
motived
;
but
Deronda
be
find
a
more
delicate
difficulty
in
a
position
which
,
superficially
take
,
be
the
reverse
of
that
 
though
to
an
ardent
reverential
love
,
the
loved
woman
have
always
a
kind
of
wealth
and
rank
which
make
a
man
keenly
susceptible
about
the
aspect
of
his
address
.
<EOS>
Deronda
's
difficulty
be
what
any
generous
man
may
have
feel
in
some
degree
;
but
it
affect
him
peculiarly
through
his
imaginative
sympathy
with
a
mind
in
which
gratitude
be
strong
.
<EOS>
Mirah
,
he
know
,
feel
herself
bind
to
him
by
deep
obligation
,
which
to
her
sensibility
may
give
every
wish
of
his
the
aspect
of
a
claim
;
and
an
inability
to
fulfill
it
would
cause
her
a
pain
continually
revive
by
their
inevitable
communion
in
care
of
Ezra
.
<EOS>
here
be
fear
not
of
pride
only
,
but
of
extreme
tenderness
.
<EOS>
altogether
,
to
have
the
character
of
a
benefactor
seem
to
Deronda
's
anxiety
an
insurmountable
obstacle
to
confess
himself
a
lover
,
unless
in
some
inconceivable
way
it
could
be
reveal
to
him
that
Mirah
's
heart
have
accept
him
beforehand
.
<EOS>
and
the
agitation
on
his
own
account
,
too
,
be
not
small
.
  
<EOS>
even
a
man
who
have
practise
himself
in
love
-
making
till
his
own
glibness
have
render
him
sceptical
,
may
at
last
be
overtake
by
the
lover
's
awe
 
may
tremble
,
stammer
,
and
show
other
sign
of
recover
sensibility
no
more
in
the
range
of
his
acquire
talent
than
pin
and
needle
after
numbness
:
<EOS>
how
much
more
may
that
energetic
timidity
possess
a
man
whose
inward
history
have
cherish
his
susceptibility
instead
of
dull
them
,
and
have
keep
all
the
language
of
passion
fresh
and
root
as
the
lovely
leafage
about
the
hill
-
side
spring
!
  
<EOS>
as
for
Mirah
her
dear
head
lie
on
its
pillow
that
night
with
its
former
suspicion
throw
out
of
shape
but
still
present
,
like
an
ugly
story
which
have
be
discredit
but
not
therefore
dissipate
.
<EOS>
all
that
she
be
certain
of
about
Deronda
seem
to
prove
that
he
have
no
such
fetter
upon
him
as
she
have
be
allow
herself
to
believe
in
.
<EOS>
His
whole
manner
as
well
as
his
word
imply
that
there
be
no
hide
bond
remain
to
have
any
effect
in
determine
his
future
.
<EOS>
but
notwithstanding
this
plainly
reasonable
inference
,
uneasiness
still
cling
about
Mirah
's
heart
.
<EOS>
Deronda
be
not
to
blame
,
but
he
have
an
importance
for
Mrs.
Grandcourt
which
must
give
her
some
hold
on
him
.
<EOS>
and
the
thought
of
any
close
confidence
between
them
stir
the
little
biting
snake
that
have
long
lain
curl
and
harmless
in
Mirah
's
gentle
bosom

<EOS>
but
do
she
this
evening
feel
as
completely
as
before
that
her
jealousy
be
no
less
remote
from
any
possibility
for
herself
personally
than
if
her
human
soul
have
be
lodge
in
the
body
of
a

Deronda

burst

<EOS>
the
determination

be
silent
about
all
the

married
life
and
its
close
,
react
in
these
escape
of
enigmatic
excitement

<EOS>
but
dim
light
of
interpretation
be
break
on
the
mother
's
mind
through
the
information
that
come
from
Sir
Hugo
to
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
and
,
with
some
omission
,
from
Mr.
Gascoigne
to
herself
.
<EOS>
the
good
-
natured
baronet
,
while
he
be
attend
to
all
decent
measure
in
relation
to
his
nephew
's
death
,
and
the
possible
washing
ashore
of
the
body
,
think
it
the
kind
thing
he
could
do
to
use
his
present
friendly
intercourse
with
the
rector
as
an
opportunity
for
communicate
with
him
,
in
the
mild
way
,
the
purport
of
Grandcourt
's
will
,
so
as
to
save
him
the
additional
shock
that
would
be
in
store
for
him
if
he
carry
his
illusion
all
the
way
home
.
<EOS>
perhaps
Sir
Hugo
would
have
be
communicable
enough
without
that
kind
motive
,
but
he
really
feel
the
motive
.
<EOS>
He
break
the
unpleasant
news
to
the
rector
by
degree
:
at
first
he
only
imply
his
fear
that
the
widow
be
not
so
splendidly
provide
for
as
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
nay
,
as
the
baronet
himself
have
expect
;
and
only
at
last
,
after
some
previous
vague
reference
to
large
claim
on
Grandcourt
,
he
disclose
the
prior
relation
which
,
in
the
unfortunate
absence
of
a
legitimate
heir
,
have
determine
all
the
splendor
in
another
direction
.
  
<EOS>
the
rector
be
deeply
hurt
,
and
remember
,
more
vividly
than
he
have
ever
do
before
,
how
offensively
proud
and
repel
the
manner
of
the
deceased
have
be
toward
him
 
remember
also
that
he
himself
,
in
that
interesting
period
just
before
the
arrival
of
the
new
occupant
at
Diplow
,
have
receive
hint
of
former
entangle
dissipation
,
and
an
undue
addiction
to
pleasure
,
though
he
have
not
foresee
that
the
pleasure
which
have
probably
,
so
to
speak
,
be
sweep
into
private
rubbish
-
heap
,
would
ever
present
itself
as
an
array
of
live
caterpillar
,
disastrous
to
the
green
meat
of
respectable
people
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
make
these
retrospective
thought
audible
to
Sir
Hugo
,
or
lower
himself
by
express
any
indignation
on
merely
personal
ground
,
but
behave
like
a
man
of
the
world
who
have
become
a
conscientious
clergyman
.
<EOS>
His
first
remark
be
    
"
<EOS>
when
a
young
man
make
his
will
in
health
,
he
usually
count
on
live
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
probably
Mr.
Grandcourt
do
not
believe
that
this
will
would
ever
have
its
present
effect
.
<EOS>
"
after
a
moment
,
he
add
,
"
the
effect
be
painful
in
more
way
than
one
.
<EOS>
female
morality
be
likely
to
suffer
from
this
marked
advantage
and
prominence
be
give
to
illegitimate
offspring
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
in
point
of
fact
,
"
say
Sir
Hugo
,
in
his
comfortable
way
,
"
since
the
boy
be
there
,
this
be
really
the
good
alternative
for
the
disposal
of
the
estate
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
have
nobody
near
than
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
a
chilling
thought
that
you
go
out
of
this
life
only
for
the
benefit
of
a
cousin
.
<EOS>
a
man
get
a
little
pleasure
in
make
his
will
,
if
it
be
for
the
good
of
his
own
curly
head
;
but
it
be
a
nuisance
when
you
be
give
the
bequeathing
to
a
use
-
up
fellow
like
yourself
,
and
one
you
do
not
care
two
straw
for
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
next
bad
thing
to
have
only
a
life
interest
in
your
estate
.
<EOS>
no
;
I
forgive
Grandcourt
for
that
part
of
his
will
.
<EOS>
but
,
between
ourselves
,
what
I
do
not
forgive
him
for
,
be
the
shabby
way
he
have
provide
for
your
niece
 
_
<EOS>
our
_
niece
,
I
will
say
 
no
better
a
position
than
if
she
have
be
a
doctor
's
widow
.
<EOS>
nothing
grate
on
me
more
than
that
posthumous
grudgingness
toward
a
wife
.
<EOS>
a
man
ought
to
have
some
pride
and
fondness
for
his
widow
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
<EOS>
should
<EOS>
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
I
take
it
as
a
test
of
a
man
,
that
he
feel
the
easy
about
his
death
when
he
can
think
of
his
wife
and
daughter
be
comfortable
after
it
.
<EOS>
I
like
that
story
of
the
fellow
in
the
crimean
war
,
who
be
ready
to
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
if
their
widow
be
provide
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
have
certainly
take
me
by
surprise
,
"
say
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
"
all
the
more
because
,
as
the
one
who
stand
in
the
place
of
father
to
my
niece

I
have
show
my
reliance
on
Mr.
Grandcourt
's
apparent
liberality
in
money
matter
by
make
no
claim
for
her
beforehand
.
<EOS>
that
seem
to
me
due
to
him
under
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
probably
you
think
me
blamable
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
blamable
exactly
.
<EOS>
I
respect
a
man
for
trust
another
.
<EOS>
but
take
my
advice
.
<EOS>
if
you
marry
another
niece
,
though
it
may
be
to
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
bind
him
down
.
<EOS>
Your
niece
can
not
be
marry
for
the
first
time
twice
over
.
<EOS>
and
if
he
be
a
good
fellow
,
he
will
wish
to
be
bind
.
<EOS>
but
as
to
Mrs.
Grandcourt
,
I
can
only
say
that
I
feel
my
relation
to
her
all
the
nearer
because
I
think
that
she
have
not
be
well
treat
.
<EOS>
and
I
hope
you
will
urge
her
to
rely
on
me
as
a
friend
.
"
  
<EOS>
thus
spake
the
chivalrous
Sir
Hugo
,
in
his
disgust
at
the
young
and
beautiful
widow
of
a
Mallinger
Grandcourt
be
leave
with
only
two
thousand
a
year
and
a
house
in
a
coal
-
mining
district
.
<EOS>
to
the
rector
that
income
naturally
appear
less
shabby
and
less
accompanied
with
mortify
privation
;
but
in
this
conversation
he
have
devour
a
much
keen
sense
than
the
baronet
's
of
the
humiliation
cast
over
his
niece
,
and
also
over
her
near
friend
,
by
the
conspicuous
publishing
of
her
husband
's
relation
to
Mrs.
Glasher
.
<EOS>
and
like
all
man
who
be
good
husband
and
father
,
he
feel
the
humiliation
through
the
mind
of
the
woman
who
would
be
chiefly
affect
by
it
;
so
that
the
annoyance
of
first
hear
the
fact
be
far
slight
than
what
he
feel
in
communicate
them
to
Mrs.
Davilow
,
and
in
anticipate
Gwendolen
's
feeling
whenever
her
mother
see
fit
to
tell
her
of
them
.
<EOS>
for
the
good
rector
have
an
innocent
conviction
that
his
niece
be
unaware
of
Mrs.
Glasher
's
existence
,
argue
with
masculine
soundness
from
what
maiden
and
wife
be
likely
to
know
,
do
,
and
suffer
,
and
have
have
a
most
imperfect
observation
of
the
particular
maiden
and
wife
in
question
.
<EOS>
not
so
Gwendolen
's
mother
,
who
now
think
that
she
see
an
explanation
of
much
that
have
be
enigmatic
in
her
child
's
conduct
and
word
before
and
after
her
engagement
,
conclude
that
in
some
inconceivable
way
Gwendolen
have
be
inform
of
this
left
-
handed
marriage
and
the
existence
of
the
child
.
<EOS>
She
trust
to
opportunity
that
would
arise
in
moment
of
affectionate
confidence
before
and
during
their
journey
to
England
,
when
she
may
gradually
learn
how
far
the
actual
state
of
thing
be
clear
to
Gwendolen
,
and
prepare
her
for
anything
that
may
be
a
disappointment
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
spare
from
device
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
do
not
expect
that
I
be
go
to
be
rich
and
grand
,
mamma
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
not
long
after
the
rector
's
communication
;
"
perhaps
I
shall
have
nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
dress
,
and
have
be
sit
long
in
quiet
meditation
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
be
startle
,
but
say
,
after
a
moment
's
reflection
    
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
,
dear
,
you
will
have
something
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
know
all
about
the
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
will
not
decide
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
abruptly
.
  
<EOS>
"
surely
,
dear
<EOS>
:
Sir
Hugo
say
you
be
to
have
two
thousand
a
year
and
the
house
at
Gadsmere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
I
have
will
depend
on
what
I
accept
,
"
say
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
You
and
my
uncle
must
not
attempt
to
cross
me
and
persuade
me
about
this
.
<EOS>
I
will
do
everything
I
can
do
to
make
you
happy
,
but
in
anything
about
my
husband
I
must
not
be
interfere
with
.
<EOS>
be
eight
hundred
a
year
enough
for
you
,
mamma
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
More
than
enough
,
dear
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
think
of
give
me
so
much
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
pause
a
little
,
and
then
say
,
"
do
you
know
who
be
to
have
the
estate
and
the
rest
of
the
money
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
wave
her
hand
in
dismissal
of
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
everything
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
perfectly
right
,
and
I
wish
never
to
have
it
mention
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
mother
be
silent
,
look
away
,
and
rise
to
fetch
a
fan
-
screen
,
with
a
slight
flush
on
her
delicate
cheek
.
<EOS>
wonder
,
imagine
<EOS>
,
she
do
not
like
to
meet
her
daughter
's
eye
,
and
sit
down
again
under
a
sad
constraint
.
<EOS>
what
wretchedness
her
child
have
perhaps
go
through
,
which
yet
must
remain
as
it
always
have
be
,
lock
away
from
their
mutual
speech
.
<EOS>
but
Gwendolen
be
watch
her
mother
with
that
new
divination
which
experience
have
give
her
;
and
in
tender
relent
at
her
own
peremptoriness
,
say
,
"
come
and
sit
nearer
to
me
,
mamma
,
and
do
not
be
unhappy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
do
as
she
be
tell
,
but
bite
her
lip
in
the
vain
attempt
to
hinder
smart
tear
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
lean
toward
her
caressingly
and
say
,
"
I
mean
to
be
very
wise
;
I
do
,
really
.
<EOS>
and
good
 
<EOS>
oh
,
so
good
to
you
,
dear
,
<EOS>
old
,
sweet
mamma
,
you
will
not
know
me
.
<EOS>
only
you
must
not
cry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
resolve
that
Gwendolen
have
in
her
mind
be
that
she
would
ask
Deronda
whether
she
ought
to
accept
any
of
her
husband
's
money
 
whether
she
may
accept
what
would
enable
her
to
provide
for
her
mother
.
<EOS>
the
poor
thing
feel
strong
enough
to
do
anything
that
would
give
her
a
high
place
in
Deronda
's
mind
.
  
<EOS>
an
invitation
that
Sir
Hugo
press
on
her
with
kind
urgency
be
that
she
and
Mrs.
Davilow
should
go
straight
with
him
to
Park
Lane
,
and
make
his
house
their
abode
as
long
as
mourning
and
other
detail
need
attend
to
in
London
.
<EOS>
Town
,
he
insist
,
be
just
then
the
most
retire
of
place
;
and
he
propose
to
exert
himself
at
once
in
get
all
article
belong
to
Gwendolen
away
from
the
house
in
Grosvenor
Square
.
<EOS>
no
proposal
could
have
suit
her
well
than
this
of
stay
a
little
while
in
Park
Lane
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
easy
for
her
there
to
have
an
interview
with
Deronda
,
if
she
only
know
how
to
get
a
letter
into
his
hand
,
ask
him
to
come
to
her
.
<EOS>
during
the
journey
,
Sir
Hugo
,
have
understand
that
she
be
acquaint
with
the
purport
of
her
husband
's
will
,
venture
to
talk
before
her
and
to
her
about
her
future
arrangement
,
refer
here
and
there
to
mildly
agreeable
prospect
as
matter
of
course
,
and
otherwise
shed
a
decorous
cheerfulness
over
her
widowed
position
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
him
really
the
more
graceful
course
for
a
widow
to
recover
her
spirit
on
find
that
her
husband
have
not
deal
as
handsomely
by
her
as
he
may
have
do
;
it
be
the
testator
's
fault
if
he
compromise
all
her
grief
at
his
departure
by
give
a
testamentary
reason
for
it
,
so
that
she
may
be
suppose
to
look
sad
,
not
because
he
have
leave
her
,
but
because
he
have
leave
her
poor
.
<EOS>
the
baronet
,
have
his
kindliness
doubly
fan
by
the
favorable
wind
on
his
fortune
and
by
compassion
for
Gwendolen
,
have
become
quite
fatherly
in
his
behavior
to
her
,
call
her
"
my
dear
,
"
and
in
mention
Gadsmere
to
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
with
its
various
advantage
and
disadvantage
,
speak
of
what
"
we
"
may
do
to
make
the
good
of
that
property
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
sit
by
in
pale
silence
while
Sir
Hugo
,
with
his
face
turn
toward
Mrs.
Davilow
or
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
conjecture
that
Mrs.
Grandcourt
may
perhaps
prefer
let
Gadsmere
to
reside
there
during
any
part
of
the
year
,
in
which
case
he
think
that
it
may
be
lease
on
capital
term
to
one
of
the
fellow
engage
with
the
coal
<EOS>
:
Sir
Hugo
have
see
enough
of
the
place
to
know
that
it
be
as
comfortable
and
picturesque
a
box
as
any
man
need
desire
,
provide
his
desire
be
circumscribe
within
a
coal
area
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
I
_
should
not
mind
about
the
soot
myself
,
"
say
the
baronet
,
with
that
dispassionateness
which
belong
to
the
potential
mood
.
<EOS>
"
nothing
be
more
healthy
.
<EOS>
and
if
one
's
business
lie
there
,
Gadsmere
would
be
a
paradise
.
<EOS>
It
make
quite
a
feature
in
Scrogg
's
history
of
the
county
,
with
the
little
tower
and
the
fine
piece
of
water
 
<EOS>
the
prettiest
print
in
the
book
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
more
important
place
than
Offendene
,
I
suppose
?
"
say
Mr.
Gascoigne
.
  
<EOS>
"
much
,
"
say
the
baronet
,
decisively
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
there
with
my
poor
brother
 
it
be
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
,
but
I
remember
it
very
well
.
<EOS>
the
room
may
not
be
large
,
but
the
ground
be
on
a
different
scale
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Our
poor
dear
offendene
be
empty
after
all

"
say
Mrs.
Davilow

<EOS>
"
when
it
come
to
the
point
,
Mr.
Haynes
declare
off
,
and
there
have
be
no
one
to
take
it
since
.
<EOS>
I
may
as
well
have
accept
Lord
Brackenshaw
's
kind
offer
that
I
should
remain
in
it
another
year
rent

free

I

<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
have
something
snug
instead

Sir
Hugo

<EOS>
"
a
little
too
snug
,
"

Mr.
Gascoigne

smile
at
his
sister

<EOS>
"
You
be
rather
thick
upon
the
ground

"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
have
turn
with
a
change
glance
when
her
mother
speak
of
Offendene
be
empty
.
<EOS>
this
conversation
pass
during
one
of
the
long
unaccountable
pause
often
experience
in
foreign
train
at
some
country
station
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
dreamy
,
sunny
stillness
over
the
hedgeless
field
stretch
to
the
boundary
of
poplar
;
and
to
Gwendolen
the
talk
within
the
carriage
seem
only
to
make
the
dreamland
large
with
an
indistinct
region
of
coal
-
pit
,
and
a
purgatorial
Gadsmere
which
she
would
never
visit
;
<EOS>
till
at
her
mother
's
word
,
this
mingle
,
doze
view
seem
to
dissolve
and
give
way
to
a
more
wakeful
vision
of
Offendene
and
pennicote
under
their
cool
light
.
<EOS>
She
see
the
gray
shoulder
of
the
down
,
the
cattle
-
speck
field
,
the
shadowy
plantation
with
rut
lane
where
the
bark
timber
lie
for
a
wayside
seat
,
the
neatly
-
clip
hedge
on
the
road
from
the
parsonage
to
Offendene
,
the
avenue
where
she
be
gradually
discern
from
the
window
,
the
hall
-
door
opening
,
and
her
mother
or
one
of
the
troublesome
sister
come
out
to
meet
her
.
<EOS>
all
that
brief
experience
of
a
quiet
home
which
have
once
seem
a
dullness
to
be
flee
from
,
now
come
back
to
her
as
a
restful
escape
,
a
station
where
she
find
the
breath
of
morning
and
the
unreproache
voice
of
bird
after
follow
a
lure
through
a
long
Satanic
masquerade
,
which
she
have
enter
on
with
an
intoxicate
belief
in
its
disguise
,
and
have
see
the
end
of
in
shriek
fear
lest
she
herself
have
become
one
of
the
evil
spirit
who
be
drop
their
human
mummery
and
hiss
around
her
with
serpent
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
way
Gwendolen
's
mind
pause
over
Offendene
and
make
it
the
scene
of
many
thought
;
but
she
give
no
further
outward
sign
of
interest
in
this
conversation
,
any
more
than
in
Sir
Hugo
's
opinion
on
the
telegraphic
cable
or
her
uncle
's
view
of
the
Church
Rate
Abolition
Bill
.
<EOS>
what
subject
will
not
our
talk
embrace
in
leisurely
day
-
journeying
from
Genoa
to
London
?
<EOS>
even
stranger
,
after
glance
from
China
to
Peru
and
open
their
mental
store
with
a
liberality
threaten
a
mutual
impression
of
poverty
on
any
future
meeting
,
be
liable
to
become
excessively
confidential
.
<EOS>
but
the
baronet
and
the
rector
be
under
a
still
strong
pressure
toward
cheerful
communication
:
they
be
like
acquaintance
compel
to
a
long
drive
in
a
mourning
-
coach
who
have
first
remark
that
the
occasion
be
a
melancholy
one
,
naturally
proceed
to
enliven
it
by
the
most
miscellaneous
discourse
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mind
tell
_
you
_
,
"
say
Sir
Hugo
to
the
rector
,
in
mention
some
private
detail
;
while
the
rector
,
without
say
so
,
do
not
mind
tell
the
baronet
about
his
son
,
and
the
difficulty
of
place
them
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
by
the
dint
of
discuss
all
person
and
thing
within
driving
-
reach
of
Diplow
,
Sir
Hugo
get
himself
work
to
a
pitch
of
interest
in
that
former
home
,
and
of
conviction
that
it
be
his
pleasant
duty
to
regain
and
strengthen
his
personal
influence
in
the
neighborhood
,
that
make
him
declare
his
intention
of
take
his
family
to
the
place
for
a
month
or
two
before
the
autumn
be
over
;
and
Mr.
Gascoigne
cordially
rejoice
in
that
prospect
.
<EOS>
altogether
,
the
journey
be
continue
and
end
with
mutual
liking
between
the
male
fellow
-
traveller
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
Gwendolen
sit
by
like
one
who
have
visit
the
spirit
-
world
and
be
full
to
the
lip
of
an
unutterable
experience
that
throw
a
strange
unreality
over
all
the
talk
she
be
hear
of
her
own
and
the
world
's
business
;
and
Mrs.
Davilow
be
chiefly
occupy
in
imagine
what
her
daughter
be
feel
,
and
in
wonder
what
be
signify
by
her
hinted
doubt
whether
she
would
accept
her
husband
's
bequest
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
in
fact
have
before
her
the
unsealed
wall
of
an
immediate
purpose
shut
off
every
other
resolution
.
<EOS>
how
to
scale
the
wall
?
<EOS>
She
want
again
to
see
and
consult
Deronda
,
that
she
may
secure
herself
against
any
act
he
would
disapprove
.
<EOS>
Would
her
remorse
have
maintain
its
power
within
her
,
or
would
she
have
feel
absolve
by
secrecy
,
if
it
have
not
be
for
that
outer
conscience
which
be
make
for
her
by
Deronda
?
<EOS>
It
be
hard
to
say
how
much
we
could
forgive
ourselves
if
we
be
secure
from
judgment
by
another
whose
opinion
be
the
breathing
-
medium
of
all
our
joy
 
who
bring
to
us
with
close
pressure
and
immediate
sequence
<EOS>
that
judgment
of
the
Invisible
and
Universal
which
self
-
flattery
and
the
world
's
tolerance
would
easily
melt
and
disperse
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
our
brother
may
be
in
the
stead
of
God
to
us
,
and
his
opinion
which
have
pierce
even
to
the
joint
and
marrow
,
may
be
our
virtue
in
the
making
.
<EOS>
that
mission
of
Deronda
to
Gwendolen
have
begin
with
what
she
have
feel
to
be
his
judgment
of
her
at
the
gaming
-
table
.
<EOS>
He
may
easily
have
spoil
it
:
 
much
of
our
life
be
spend
in
mar
our
own
influence
and
turn
other
'
belief
in
us
into
a
widely
conclude
unbelief
which
they
call
knowledge
of
the
world
,
while
it
be
really
disappointment
in
you
or
me
.
<EOS>
Deronda
have
not
spoil
his
mission
.
  
<EOS>
but
Gwendolen
have
forget
to
ask
him
for
his
address
in
case
she
want
to
write
,
and
her
only
way
of
reach
him
be
through
Sir
Hugo
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
in
the
least
blind
to
the
construction
that
all
witness
may
put
on
her
give
sign
of
dependence
on
Deronda
,
and
her
seek
him
more
than
he
seek
her
:
Grandcourt
's
rebuke
have
sufficiently
enlighten
her
pride
.
<EOS>
but
the
force
,
the
tenacity
of
her
nature
have
throw
itself
into
that
dependence
,
and
she
would
no
more
let
go
her
hold
on
Deronda
's
help
,
or
deny
herself
the
interview
her
soul
need
,
because
of
witness
,
than
if
she
have
be
in
prison
in
danger
of
be
condemn
to
death
.
<EOS>
when
she
be
in
Park
Lane
and
know
that
the
baronet
would
be
go
down
to
the
Abbey
immediately
(
just
to
see
his
family
for
a
couple
of
day
and
then
return
to
transact
needful
business
for
Gwendolen
)
,
she
say
to
him
without
any
air
of
hesitation
,
while
her
mother
be
present
    
<EOS>
"
Sir
Hugo
,
I
wish
to
see
Mr.
Deronda
again
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
his
address
.
<EOS>
Will
you
tell
it
me
,
or
let
him
know
that
I
want
to
see
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
a
quick
thought
pass
across
Sir
Hugo
's
face
,
but
make
no
difference
to
the
ease
with
which
he
say
,
"
upon
my
word
,
I
do
not
know
whether
he
be
at
his
chamber
or
the
Abbey
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
make
sure
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
will
send
a
note
now
to
his
chamber
tell
him
to
come
,
and
if
he
be
at
the
Abbey
I
can
give
him
your
message
and
send
him
up
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
he
will
want
to
obey
your
wish
,
"
the
baronet
end
,
with
grave
kindness
,
as
if
nothing
could
seem
to
him
more
in
the
appropriate
course
of
thing
than
that
she
should
send
such
a
message
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
be
convince
that
Gwendolen
have
a
passionate
attachment
to
Deronda
<EOS>
,
the
seed
of
which
have
be
lay
long
ago
,
and
his
former
suspicion
now
recur
to
him
with
more
strength
than
ever
,
that
her
feeling
be
likely
to
lead
her
into
imprudence
 
in
which
kind
-
hearted
Sir
Hugo
be
determine
to
screen
and
defend
her
as
far
as
lie
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
to
him
it
be
as
pretty
a
story
as
need
be
that
this
fine
creature
and
his
favorite
Dan
should
have
turn
out
to
be
form
for
each
other
,
and
that
the
unsuitable
husband
should
have
make
his
exit
in
such
excellent
time
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
like
that
a
charming
woman
should
be
make
as
happy
as
possible
.
<EOS>
in
truth
,
what
most
vex
his
mind
in
this
matter
at
present
be
a
doubt
whether
the
too
lofty
and
inscrutable
Dan
have
not
get
some
scheme
or
other
in
his
head
,
which
would
prove
to
be
dearer
to
him
than
the
lovely
Mrs.
Grandcourt
,
and
put
that
neatly
-
prepared
marriage
with
her
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
It
be
among
the
usual
paradox
of
feeling
that
Sir
Hugo
,
who
have
give
his
fatherly
caution
to
Deronda
against
too
much
tenderness
in
his
relation
with
the
bride
,
should
now
feel
rather
irritated
against
him
by
the
suspicion
that
he
have
not
fall
in
love
as
he
ought
to
have
do
.
<EOS>
of
course
all
this
thinking
on
Sir
Hugo
's
part
be
eminently
premature
,
only
a
fortnight
or
so
after
Grandcourt
's
death
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
the
trick
of
think
to
be
either
premature
or
behind
-
hand
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
he
send
the
note
to
Deronda
's
chamber
,
and
it
find
him
there
.
      
<EOS>
"

MILTON
.
   
<EOS>
Deronda
do
not
obey
Gwendolen
's
new
summon
without
some
agitation
.
<EOS>
not
his
vanity
,
but
his
keen
sympathy
make
him
susceptible
to
the
danger
that
another
's
heart
may
feel
large
demand
on
him
than
he
would
be
able
to
fulfill
;
and
it
be
no
longer
a
matter
of
argument
with
him
,
but
of
penetrate
consciousness
,
that
Gwendolen
's
soul
clung
to
his
with
a
passionate
need
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
argue
the
existence
of
the
anger
or
the
scorn
that
thrill
through
us
in
a
voice
;
we
simply
feel
it
,
and
it
admit
of
no
disproof
.
<EOS>
Deronda
feel
this
woman
's
destiny
hang
on
his
over
a
precipice
of
despair
.
<EOS>
any
one
who
know
him
can
not
wonder
at
his
inward
confession
,
that
if
all
this
have
happen
little
more
than
a
year
ago
,
he
would
hardly
have
ask
himself
whether
he
love
her
;
<EOS>
the
impetuous
determining
impulse
which
would
have
move
him
would
have
be
to
save
her
from
sorrow
,
to
shelter
her
life
forevermore
from
the
danger
of
loneliness
,
and
carry
out
to
the
last
the
rescue
he
have
begin
in
that
monitory
redemption
of
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
love
and
duty
have
throw
other
bond
around
him
,
and
that
impulse
could
no
longer
determine
his
life
;
still
,
it
be
present
in
him
as
a
compassionate
yearning
,
a
painful
quivering
at
the
very
imagination
of
have
again
and
again
to
meet
the
appeal
of
her
eye
and
word
.
<EOS>
the
very
strength
of
the
bond
,
the
certainty
of
the
resolve
,
that
keep
him
asunder
from
her
,
make
him
gaze
at
her
lot
apart
with
the
more
aching
pity
.
  
<EOS>
He
await
her
come
in
the
back
drawing
-
room
 
part
of
that
white
and
crimson
space
where
they
have
sit
together
at
the
musical
party
,
where
Gwendolen
have
say
for
the
first
time
that
her
lot
depend
on
his
not
forsake
her
,
and
her
appeal
have
seem
to
melt
into
the
melodic
cry
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
per
pietà
non
dirmi
addio
_
.
<EOS>
but
the
melody
have
come
from
Mirah
's
dear
voice
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
walk
about
this
room
,
which
he
have
for
year
know
by
heart
,
with
a
strange
sense
of
metamorphosis
in
his
own
life
.
<EOS>
the
familiar
object
around
him
,
from
Lady
Mallinger
's
gently
smile
portrait
to
the
also
human
and
urbane
face
of
the
lion
on
the
pilaster
of
the
chimney
-
piece
,
seem
almost
to
belong
to
a
previous
state
of
existence
which
he
be
revisit
in
memory
only
,
not
in
reality
;
so
deep
and
transform
have
be
the
impression
he
have
lately
experience
,
<EOS>
so
new
be
the
condition
under
which
he
find
himself
in
the
house
he
have
be
accustom
to
think
of
as
a
home
 
stand
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
await
the
entrance
of
a
young
creature
whose
life
have
also
be
undergo
a
transformation
 
a
tragic
transformation
toward
a
wavering
result
,
in
which
he
feel
with
apprehensiveness
that
his
own
action
be
still
bind
up
.
  
<EOS>
but
Gwendolen
be
come
in
,
look
change
;
not
only
by
her
mourning
dress
,
but
by
a
more
satisfied
quietude
of
expression
than
he
have
see
in
her
face
at
Genoa
.
<EOS>
Her
satisfaction
be
that
Deronda
be
there
;
but
there
be
no
smile
between
them
as
they
meet
and
clasped
hand
;
each
be
full
of
remembrance
 
full
of
anxious
prevision
.
<EOS>
She
say
,
"
It
be
good
of
you
to
come
.
<EOS>
let
us
sit
down
,
"
immediately
seat
herself
in
the
near
chair
.
<EOS>
He
place
himself
opposite
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
you
to
come
because
I
want
you
to
tell
me
what
I
ought

do

she
begin

at
once
.

<EOS>
do
not
be
afraid
of
tell
me
what
you
think
be
right
,
because
it
seem
hard
.
<EOS>
I
have
make
up
my
mind
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
once
of
be
poor
;
I
could
not
bear
to
think
of
be
under
other
people
;
and
that
be
why
I
do
something
 
why
I
marry
.
<EOS>
I
have
bear
bad
thing
now
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
could
bear
to
be
poor
,
if
you
think
I
ought

<EOS>
do
you
know
about
my
husband
's
will
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Sir
Hugo
tell
me
,
"
say
Deronda
,
already
guess
the
question
she
have
to
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ought
I
to
take
anything
he
have
leave
me
?
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
what
I
have
be
think
,
"
say
Gwendolen
,
with
a
more
nervous
eagerness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
perhaps
you
may
not
quite
know
that
I
really
do
think
a
good
deal
about
my
mother
when
I
marry
.
<EOS>
I
_
be
_
selfish
,
but
I
do
love
her
,
and
feel
about
her
poverty
;
and
what
comfort
me
most
at
first
,
when
I
be
miserable
,
be
her
be
well
off
because
I
have
marry
.
<EOS>
the
thing
that
would
be
hard
to
me
now
would
be
to
see
her
in
poverty
again
;
and
I
have
be
think
that
if
I
take
enough
to
provide
for
her
,
and
no
more
 
nothing
for
myself
 
it
would
not
be
wrong
;
for
I
be
very
precious
to
my
mother
 
<EOS>
and
he
take
me
from
her
 
<EOS>
and
he
mean
 
<EOS>
and
if
she
have
know
 
"
  
Gwendolen
break
off
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
prepare
herself
for
this
interview
by
think
of
hardly
anything
else
than
this
question
of
right
toward
her
mother
;
but
the
question
have
carry
with
it
thought
and
reason
which
it
be
impossible
for
her
to
utter
,
and
these
perilous
remembrance
swarm
between
her
word
,
make
her
speech
more
and
more
agitated
and
tremulous
.
<EOS>
She
look
down
helplessly
at
her
hand
,
now
unladen
of
all
ring
except
her
wedding
-
ring
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
hurt
yourself
by
speak
of
that
,
"
say
Deronda
,
tenderly
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
need
;
the
case
be
very
simple
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
can
hardly
judge
wrongly
about
it
.
<EOS>
You
consult
me
because
I
be
the
only
person
to
whom
you
have
confide
the
most
painful
part
of
your
experience
:
and
I
can
understand
your
scruple

<EOS>
"
He
do
not
go
on
immediately
,
wait
for
her
to
recover
herself
.
<EOS>
the
silence
seem
to
Gwendolen
full
of
the
tenderness
that
she
hear
in
his
voice
,
and
she
have
courage
to
lift
up
her
eye
and
look
at
him
as
he
say
,
"
You
be
conscious
of
something
which
you
feel
to
be
a
crime
toward
one
who
be
dead
.
<EOS>
You
think
that
you
have
forfeit
all
claim
as
a
wife
.
<EOS>
You
shrink
from
take
what
be
his
.
<EOS>
You
want
to
keep
yourself
from
profit
by
his
death
.
<EOS>
Your
feeling
even
urge
you
to
some
self
-
punishment
 
some
scourging
of
the
self
that
disobey
your
well
<EOS>
will
 
the
will
that
struggle
against
temptation

<EOS>
I
have
know
something
of
that
myself

do
I
understand
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
 
at
least
,
I
want
to
be
good
 
not
like
what
I
have
be
,

say
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
to
bear
what
you
think
I
ought
to
bear

I
have
try

tell
you
the
bad
about
myself

I
to
do

<EOS>
"
if
no
one
but
yourself
be
concern
in
this
question
of
income
,
"
say
Deronda
,
"
I
should
hardly
dare
to
urge
you
against
any
remorseful
prompting
;
but
I
take
as
a
guide
now
,
your
feeling
about
Mrs.
Davilow
,
which
seem
to
me
quite
just
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
think
that
your
husband
's
due
even
to
yourself
be
nullify
by
any
act
you
have
commit
.
<EOS>
He
voluntarily
enter
into
your
life
,
and
affect
its
course
in
what
be
always
the
most
momentous
way
.
<EOS>
but
set
that
aside
,
it
be
due
from
him
in
his
position
that
he
should
provide
for
your
mother
,
and
he
of
course
understand
that
if
this
will
take
effect
she
would
share
the
provision
he
have
make
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
have
eight
hundred
a
year
.
<EOS>
what
I
think
of
be
to
take
that
and
leave
the
rest
,
"
say
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
so
long
inwardly
argue
for
this
as
a
permission
,
that
her
mind
could
not
at
once
take
another
attitude
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
not
your
duty
to
fix
a
limit
in
that
way
,
"
say
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
be
make
a
painful
enigma
for
Mrs.
Davilow
;
an
income
from
which
you
shut
yourself
out
must
be
embitter
to
her
.
<EOS>
and
your
own
course
would
become
too
difficult
.
<EOS>
We
agree
at
Genoa
that
the
burden
on
your
conscience
be
one
what
no
one
ought
to
be
admit
to
the
knowledge
of
.
<EOS>
the
future
beneficence
of
your
life
will
be
best
further
by
your
saving
all
other
from
the
pain
of
that
knowledge
.
<EOS>
in
my
opinion
you
ought
simply
to
abide
by
the
provision
of
your
husband
's
will
,
and
let
your
remorse
tell
only
on
the
use
that
you
will
make
of
your
monetary
independence
.

<EOS>
in
utter
the
last
sentence
Deronda
automatically
take
up
his
hat
which
he
have
lay
on
the
floor
beside
him
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
sensitive
to
his
slight
movement
,
feel
her
heart
give
a
great
leap
,
as
if
it
too
have
a
consciousness
of
its
own
,
and
would
hinder
him
from
go
:
in
the
same
moment
she
rise
from
her
chair
,
unable
to
reflect
that
the
movement
be
an
acceptance
of
his
apparent
intention
to
leave
her
;
and
Deronda
,
of
course
,
also
rise
,
advance
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
what
you
tell
me
,

say
Gwendolen
,
hurriedly
;

what
else
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
other
than
these
simple
word
be
possible
to
her
;
and
even
these
be
too
much
for
her
in
a
state
of
emotion
where
her
proud
secrecy
be
disenthrone
:
as
the
child
-
like
sentence
fall
from
her
lip
they
re
-
act
on
her
like
a
picture
of
her
own
helplessness
,
and
she
could
not
check
the
sob
which
send
the
large
tear
to
her
eye
.
<EOS>
Deronda
,
too
,
feel
a
crush
pain
;
but
imminent
consequence
be
visible
to
him
,
and
urge
him
to
the
utmost
exertion
of
conscience

<EOS>
when
she
have
press
her
tear
away
,
he
say
,
in
a
gently
question
tone
    
<EOS>
"
You
will
probably
be
soon
go
with
Mrs.
Davilow
into

country

<EOS>
yes

in

week

ten
day

Gwendolen
wait
an
instant
,
turn
her
eye
vaguely
toward
the
window

as
if
look
at
some
imagine
prospect

kind

look
at

at

it

what
make
life

once

Gwendolen
turn
her

athirst
toward

Deronda
feel
the
look
as
if
she
have
be
stretch
her
arm
toward
him
from

His

this

you

You
have

the

mingled
emotion

through
her

with
a
strength
that

the

some

seem
inseparable

It
be
not
her

that
he
love
her

would
cling

a

he
add

correctively

"
yes

and
then
release
her

with
the
final
friendly
pressure
of
one
who
have
virtually
say
good

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
again
a

.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
feel
a
pang
,
which
show
itself
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
He
look
miserable
as
he
say
,
"
I
will
certainly
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
perceive
the
change
in
his
face
;
but
the
intense
relief
of
expect
him
to
come
again
could
not
give
way
to
any
other
feeling
,
and
there
be
a
recovery
of
the
inspire
hope
and
courage
in
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
be
unhappy
about
me
,
"
she
say
,
in
a
tone
of
affectionate
assurance

<EOS>
"
I
shall
remember
your

<EOS>
I
shall
remember
what
you
believe
about
me
;
I
shall
try

"
  
<EOS>
She
look
at
him
firmly
,
and
put
out
her
hand
again
as
if
she
have
forget
what
have
pass
since
those
word
of
his
which
she
promise
to
remember
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
approach
to
a
smile
on
her
lip
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
smile
since
her
husband
's
death
.
<EOS>
when
she
stand
still
and
in
silence
,
she
look
like
a
melancholy
statue
of
the
Gwendolen
whose
laughter
have
once
be
so
ready
when
other
be
grave
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
only
by
remember
the
search
anguish
which
have
change
the
aspect
of
the
world
for
her
that
we
can
understand
her
behavior
to
Deronda
 
the
unreflecting
openness
,
nay
,
the
importunate
pleading
,
with
which
she
express
her
dependence
on
him
.
<EOS>
consideration
such
as
would
have
fill
the
mind
of
indifferent
spectator
could
not
occur
to
her
,
any
more
than
if
flame
have
be
mount
around
her
,
and
she
have
fling
herself
into
his
open
arm
and
cling
about
his
neck
that
he
may
carry
her
into
safety
.
<EOS>
She
identify
him
with
the
struggle
regenerative
process
in
her
which
have
begin
with
his
action
.
<EOS>
be
it
any
wonder
that
she
see
her
own
necessity
reflect
in
his
feeling
?
<EOS>
She
be
in
that
state
of
unconscious
reliance
and
expectation
which
be
a
common
experience
with
us
when
we
be
preoccupy
with
our
own
trouble
or
our
own
purpose
.
<EOS>
We
diffuse
our
feeling
over
other
,
and
count
on
their
acting
from
our
motive
.
<EOS>
Her
imagination
have
not
be
turn
to
a
future
union
with
Deronda
by
any
other
than
the
spiritual
tie
which
have
be
continually
strengthen
;
but
also
it
have
not
be
turn
toward
a
future
separation
from
him
.
<EOS>
love
-
making
and
marriage
 
<EOS>
how
could
they
now
be
the
imagery
in
which
poor
Gwendolen
's
deep
attachment
could
spontaneously
clothe
itself
?
<EOS>
Mighty
Love
have
lay
his
hand
upon
her
;
but
what
have
he
demand
of
her
?
<EOS>
acceptance
of
rebuke
 
<EOS>
the
hard
task
of
self
-
change
 
confession
 
endurance
.
<EOS>
if
she
cry
toward
him
,
what
then
?
<EOS>
She
cry
as
the
child
cry
whose
little
foot
have
fall
backward
 
cry
to
be
take
by
the
hand
,
lest
she
should
lose
herself
.
  
<EOS>
the
cry
pierce
Deronda
.
<EOS>
what
position
could
have
be
more
difficult
for
a
man
full
of
tenderness
,
yet
with
clear
foresight
?
<EOS>
He
be
the
only
creature
who
know
the
real
nature
of
Gwendolen
's
trouble
:
to
withdraw
himself
from
any
appeal
of
her
would
be
to
consign
her
to
a
dangerous
loneliness
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
reconcile
himself
to
the
cruelty
of
apparently
reject
her
dependence
on
him
;
and
yet
in
the
nearer
or
farth
distance
he
see
a
come
wrench
,
which
all
present
strengthening
of
their
bond
would
make
the
hard
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
oblige
to
risk
that
.
<EOS>
He
go
once
and
again
to
Park
Lane
before
Gwendolen
leave
;
but
their
interview
be
in
the
presence
of
Mrs.
Davilow
,
and
be
therefore
less
agitating
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
since
she
have
determine
to
accept
her
income
,
have
conceive
a
project
which
she
like
to
speak
of
:
it
be
,
to
place
her
mother
and
sister
with
herself
in
Offendene
again
,
and
,
as
she
say
,
piece
back
her
life
unto
that
time
when
they
first
go
there
,
and
when
everything
be
happiness
about
her
,
only
she
do
not
know
it
.
<EOS>
the
idea
have
be
mention
to
Sir
Hugo
,
who
be
go
to
exert
himself
about
the
letting
of
Gadsmere
for
a
rent
which
would
more
than
pay
the
rent
of
Offendene
.
<EOS>
all
this
be
tell
to
Deronda
,
who
willingly
dwelt
on
a
subject
that
seem
to
give
some
soothing
occupation
to
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
He
say
nothing
and
she
ask
nothing
,
of
what
chiefly
occupy
himself
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
be
fix
on
his
come
to
Diplow
before
the
autumn
be
over
;
and
she
no
more
thought
of
the
Lapidoths
 
the
little
Jewess
and
her
brother
 
as
likely
to
make
a
difference
in
her
destiny
,
than
of
the
fermenting
political
and
social
leaven
which
be
make
a
difference
in
the
history
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
in
fact
poor
Gwendolen
's
memory
have
be
stun
,
and
all
outside
the
lava
-
light
track
of
her
troubled
conscience
,
and
her
effort
to
get
deliverance
from
it
,
lie
for
her
in
dim

meanwhile
Ezra

Gwendolen

not
include
in
her
think
about
Deronda
,
be
have
their
relation
to
him
draw
closer
and
bring
into
full
light
.
  
<EOS>
the

Lapidoth
have
quit
his
daughter
at
the
doorstep

rule
by
that
possibility
of
stake
something
in

which
present
itself
with
the
handling
of
any
sum
beyond
the
price

actual

leave
no

<EOS>
until
he
have
lose
everything
he
never
consider
whether
he
would
apply
to
Mirah
again
or
whether
he
would
brave
his
son
's
presence

<EOS>
in
the
first
moment
he
have
shrink
from
encounter
Ezra
as
he
would
have
shrink
from
any
other
situation
of
disagreeable
constraint
;
and
the
possession
of
Mirah
's
purse
be
enough
to
banish
the
thought
of
future
necessity
.
<EOS>
the
gambling
appetite
be
more
absolutely
dominant
than
bodily
hunger
,
which
can
be
neutralize
by
an
emotional
or
intellectual
excitation
;
but
the
passion
for
watch
chance
 
the
habitual
suspensive
poise
of
the
mind
in
actual
or
imaginary
play
 
nullifie
the
susceptibility
of
other
excitation
.
<EOS>
in
its
final
,
imperious
stage
,
it
seem
the
unjoyous
dissipation
of
demon
,
seek
diversion
on
the
burn
marl
of
perdition
.
  
<EOS>
but
every
form
of
selfishness
,
however
abstract
and
unhuman
,
require
the
support
of
at
least
one
meal
a
day
;
and
though
Lapidoth
's
appetite
for
food
and
drink
be
extremely
moderate
,
he
have
slip
into
a
shabby
,
unfriendly
form
of
life
in
which
the
appetite
could
not
be
satisfied
without
some
ready
money
.
<EOS>
when
,
in
a
brief
visit
at
a
house
which
announce
"
Pyramids
"
on
the
window
-
blind
,
he
have
first
double
and
treble
and
finally
lose
Mirah
's
thirty
shilling
,
he
go
out
with
her
empty
purse
in
his
pocket
,
already
balance
in
his
mind
whether
he
should
get
another
immediate
stake
by
pawn
the
purse
,
or
whether
he
should
go
back
to
her
give
himself
a
good
countenance
by
restore
the
purse
,
and
declare
that
he
have
use
the
money
in
pay
a
score
that
be
stand
against
him
.
<EOS>
besides
,
among
the
sensibility
still
leave
strong
in
Lapidoth
be
the
sensibility
to
his
own
claim
,
and
he
appear
to
himself
to
have
a
claim
on
any
property
his
child
may
possess
,
which
be
strong
than
the
justice
of
his
son
's
resentment
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
to
take
up
his
lodging
with
his
child
be
the
good
thing
he
could
do
;
and
the
more
he
think
of
meet
Ezra
the
less
he
wince
from
it
,
his
imagination
be
more
wrought
on
by
the
chance
of
his
get
something
into
his
pocket
with
safety
and
without
exertion
,
than
by
the
threat
of
a
private
humiliation
.
<EOS>
Luck
have
be
against
him
lately
;
he
expect
it
to
turn
 
and
may
not
the
turn
begin
with
some
opening
of
supply
which
would
present
itself
through
his
daughter
's
affair
and
the
good
friend
she
have
speak
of
?
<EOS>
Lapidoth
count
on
the
fascination
of
his
cleverness
 
an
old
habit
of
mind
which
early
experience
have
sanction
:
and
it
be
not
only
woman
who
be
unaware
of
their
diminished
charm
,
or
imagine
that
they
can
feign
not
to
be
wear
out
.
  
<EOS>
the
result
of
Lapidoth
's
rapid
balancing
be
that
he
go
toward
the
little
square
in
Brompton
with
the
hope
that
,
by
walk
about
and
watch
,
he
may
catch
sight
of
Mirah
go
out
or
return
,
in
which
case
his
entrance
into
the
house
would
be
make
easy
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
already
evening
 
<EOS>
the
evening
of
the
day
next
to
that
which
he
have
first
see
her
;
and
after
a
little
waiting
,
weariness
make
him
reflect
that
he
may
ring
,
and
if
she
be
not
at
home
he
may
ask
the
time
at
which
she
be
expect
.
<EOS>
but
on
come
near
the
house
he
know
that
she
be
at

he
hear
her
singing

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
down
to
him
,
"
say
Mirah
,
start
up
immediately
and
look
at
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Mirah
,
not
so
,
"
say
Ezra
,
with
decision
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
let
him
come
up
,
Mrs.
Adam
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
stand
with
her
hand
pinch
each
other
,
and
feel
sick
with
anxiety
,
while
she
continue
look
at
Ezra
,
who
have
also
rise
,
and
be
evidently
much
shake
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
an
expression
in
his
face
which
she
have
never
see
before
;
his
brow
be
knit
,
his
lip
seem
harden
with
the
same
severity
that
gleam
from
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mrs.
Adam
open
the
door
to
let
in
the
father
,
she
could
not
help
cast
a
look
at
the
group
,
and
after
glance
from
the
young
man
to
the
elder
,
say
to
herself
as
she
close
the
door
,
"
Father
,
sure
enough
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
likeness
be
that
of
outline
,
which
be
always
most
striking
at
the
first
moment
;
the
expression
have
be
work
into
the
strong
contrast
by
such
hide
or
inconspicuous
difference
as
can
make
the
genius
of
a
Cromwell
within
the
outward
type
of
a
father
who
be
no
more
than
a
respectable
parishioner
.
  
<EOS>
Lapidoth
have
put
on
a
melancholy
expression
beforehand
,
but
there
be
some
real
wincing
in
his
frame
as
he
say
    
"
well
,
Ezra
,
my
boy
,
you
hardly
know
me
after
so
many
year
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
 
<EOS>
too
well
 
<EOS>

"
say
Ezra
,
with
a
slow
biting
solemnity
which
make
the
word
father
a
reproach
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
you
be
not
pleased
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
wonder
at
it

appearance
have
be
against
me

<EOS>
when

man
get
into
strait
he
can
not

just
as
he
would
by
himself
or
anybody
else
,
_
i_'ve
suffer
enough
,
I
know
,
"
say
Lapidoth
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
in
speak
he
always
recover
some
glibness
and
hardihood
;
and
now
turn
toward
Mirah
,
he
hold
out
her
purse
,
say
,
"
here
be
your
little
purse
,
my
dear

<EOS>
I
think
you
would
be
anxious
about
it
because
of
that
bit
of
writing
.
<EOS>
I
have
empty
it
<EOS>
,
you
will
see
,
for
I

a
score
to

<EOS>
I

you
would
like

to
clear
myself

here
I

without

farthing
in
my
pocket
 
at
the

You
can
turn
me
out
if
you
like

without

a

the
word

Mirah

say
,
"

I
have
have
enough

I
be

the
tear
be
in
his
voice
as

,
before
he
have
finish
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
could
never

answer
Mirah
,
with
not
the
less
anguish
because
she
feel
the
falsity
of
everything
in
his
speech
except
the
imply
wish
to
remain
in

Ezra
,
in
a
tone
of
authority

<EOS>
She
look
at
her
brother
falteringly
,
beseechingly
 
in
awe
of
his
decision
,
yet
unable
to
go
without

a
plea
for
this

She
go
close

and
put
her
hand
in
his

,
in
a
low
voice
,
but
not
so
low
as
to
be
unheard
by
Lapidoth

"

She
leave

step
up

down
with

whatever

Lapidoth

in
adjust

have
not

the

intensity
of
the
lightning
or
the
exact
course
it
would
take
 
that
it
would
not

outside

through

<EOS>
He
could
not
foresee
what
be
so
new
to
him
as
this
voice
from
the
soul
of
his
son
.
<EOS>
It
touch
that
spring
of
hysterical
excitability
which
Mirah
use
to
witness
in
him
when
he
sit
at
home
and
sob

<EOS>
as
Ezra

Lapidoth
throw
himself
into
a
chair
and
cry
like
a
woman

bury
his
face
against
the
table
 
and
yet
,
strangely
,
while
this
hysterical
crying
be
an
inevitable
reaction
in
him
under
the
stress
of
his
son
's
word
,
it
be
also
a
conscious
resource
in
a
difficulty
;
just
as
in
early
life
,
when
he
be
a
bright
-
faced
curly
young
man
,
he
have
be
use
to
avail
himself
of
this
subtly
-
poise
physical
susceptibility
to
turn
the
edge
of
resentment
or
disapprobation
.
  
<EOS>
Ezra
sit
down
again
and
say
nothing
 
exhaust
by
the
shock
of
his
own
irrepressible
utterance
,
the
outburst
of
feeling
which
for
year
he
have
bear
in
solitude
and
silence
.
<EOS>
His
thin
hand
tremble
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
;
he
would
hardly
have
find
voice
to
answer
a
question
;
he
feel
as
if
he
have
take
a
step
toward
beckon
death
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
Mirah
's
quick
expectant
ear
detect
a
sound
which
her
heart
recognize
<EOS>
:
she
could
not
stay
out
of

room
any
longer

<EOS>

on
open

door
her
immediate
alarm
be

it

to
his
side
that
she
go
,
take
his
tremble
hand
in
hers

which

press
and
find
support
in
;

the

with

enter

presently
lift
up
his
head
,
press
his
handkerchief
against
his
eye

put
out
his
hand
toward
her
,
and
say
with
plaintive
hoarseness
,
"
good

Mirah
;
your

will
not
trouble
you
again

He

put
her
hand
in
his
and
hold
him

She
be
not
tearful
and
grieve
,
but
frightened
and
awe
-
strike
,
as
she
cry
out
    
"
no

father
,
no

"
<EOS>
then
turn
to
her
brother
,
"
Ezra
,
you
have
not
forbid
him
?
 
<EOS>
Stay
,
father

and
leave
off
wrong
thing

Ezra
,
I
can
not

how
can
I
say
to

"
go

draw
him
toward
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
really
what
Lapidoth
want
.
<EOS>
and
for
the
moment
he
feel
a
sort
of
comfort
in
recover
his
daughter
's
dutiful
attendance
,
that
make
a
change
of
habit
seem
possible
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
lead
him
down
to
the
parlor
below
,
and
say
    
"
this
be
my
sitting
-
room
when
I
be
not
with
Ezra

and
there
be
a
bed

room
behind
which
shall
be
yours

<EOS>
You
will
stay
and
be
good
,
father

<EOS>
think
that
you
be
come
back
to
my
mother
,
and
that
she
have
forgive
you
 
<EOS>
she
speak
to
you
through
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mirah
's
tone
be
implore
,
but
she
could
not
give
one
of
her
former
caress
.
  
<EOS>
Lapidoth
quickly
recover
his
composure
,
begin
to
speak
to
Mirah
of
the
improvement
in
her
voice
,
and
other
easy
subject
,
and
when
Mrs.
Adam
come
to
lay
out
his
supper
,
enter
into
converse
with
her
in
order
to
show
her
that
he
be
not
a
common
person
,
though
his
clothe
be
just
now
against
him

<EOS>
but
in
his
usual
wakefulness
at
night
,
he
fall
to
wonder
what
money
Mirah
have
by
her
,
and
go
back
over
old
Continental
hour
at
_
Roulette
_
,
reproduce
the
method
of
his
play
,
and
the
chance
that
have
frustrate
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
have
his
reason
for
come
to
England
,
but
for
most
thing
it
be
a
curse
country
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
the
strong
vision
of
the
night
with
Lapidoth
,
and
not
the
worn
frame
of
his
ireful
son
utter
a
terrible
judgment
.
<EOS>
Ezra
do
pass
across
the
gaming
-
table
,
and
his
word
be
audible
;
but
he
pass
like
an
insubstantial
ghost
,
and
his
word
have
the
heart
eat
out
of
them
by
number
and
movement
that
seem
to
make
the
very
tissue
of
Lapidoth
's
consciousness

the
godhead
in
us
wring
our
noble
deed
  
from
our
reluctant
self
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
an
unpleasant
surprise
to
Deronda
when
he
return
from
the
Abbey
to
find
the
undesirable
father
instal
in
the
lodging
at
Brompton
.
<EOS>
Mirah
have
feel
it
necessary
to
speak
of
Deronda
to
her
father
,
and
even
to
make
him
as
fully
aware
as
she
could
of
the
way
in
which
the
friendship
with
Ezra
have
begin
,
and
of
the
sympathy
which
have
cement
it
.
<EOS>
She
pass
more
lightly
over
what
Deronda
have
do
for
her
,
omit
altogether
the
rescue
from
drown
,
and
speaking
of
the
shelter
she
have
find
in
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
family
so
as
to
leave
her
father
to
suppose
that
it
be
through
these
friend
Deronda
have
become
acquaint
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
persuade
herself
to
more
completeness
in
her
narrative
:
<EOS>
she
could
not
let
the
breath
of
her
father
's
soul
pass
over
her
relation
to
Deronda
.
<EOS>
and
Lapidoth
,
for
reason
,
be
not
eager
in
his
questioning
about
the
circumstance
of
her
flight
and
arrival
in
England
.

but
he
be
much
interested
in
the
fact
of
his
child

a
beneficent
friend
apparently
high
in
the
world

It
be

brother
who
tell
Deronda
of
this
new
condition
add
to
their
life

"
I
be
become
calm
in
behold
him
now

"
Ezra
end
,

and
I
try
to
think
it
possible
that
my
sister
's
tenderness
,
and
the
daily
taste
a
life
of
peace
,
may
win
him
to
remain
aloof
from
temptation

I
have
enjoin
her
,
and
she
have
promise
,
to
trust
him
with
no
money

have
convince
her
that

will
buy
with
it
his
own
destruction

departure
,
and
,
get
a
view
of
him
from
the
window
,
be
rather
surprised
at
his
youthfulness
,
which
Mirah
have
not
mention
,
and
which
he
have
somehow
think
out
of
the
question
in
a
personage
who
have
take
up
a
grave
friendship
and
hoary
study
with
the
sepulchral
Ezra
.
<EOS>
Lapidoth
begin
to
imagine
that
Deronda
's
real
or
chief
motive
must
be
that
he
be
in
love
with
Mirah
.
<EOS>
and
so
much
the
well
;
for
a
tie
to
Mirah
have
more
promise
of
indulgence
for
her
father
than
a
tie
to
Ezra
:
and
Lapidoth
be
not
without
the
hope
of
recommend
himself
to
Deronda
,
and
of
soften
any
hard
prepossession
.
<EOS>
He
be
behave
with
much
amiability
,
and
try
in
all
way
at
his
command
to
get
himself
into
easy
domestication
with
his
child
 
enter
into
Mirah
's
music
,
show
himself
docile
about
smoking
,
which
Mrs.
Adam
could
not
tolerate
in
her
parlor
,
and
walk
out
in
the
square
with
his
german
pipe
,
and
the
tobacco
with
which
Mirah
supply
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
too
acute
to
offer
any
present
remonstrance
against
the
refusal
of
money
,
which
Mirah
tell
him
that
she
must
persist
in
as
a
solemn
duty
promise
to
her
brother
.
<EOS>
He
be
comfortable
enough
to
wait
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
time
Deronda
come
,
Lapidoth
,
equip
in
his
new
clothe
,
and
satisfied
with
his
own
appearance
,
be
in
the
room
with
Ezra
,
who
be
teach
himself
,
as
a
part
of
his
severe
duty
,
to
tolerate
his
father
's
presence
whenever
it
be
impose
.
<EOS>
Deronda
be
cold
and
distant
,
the
first
sight
of
this
man
,
who
have
blight
the
life
of
his
wife
and
child
,
create
in
him
a
repulsion
that
be
even
a
physical
discomfort
.
<EOS>
but
Lapidoth
do
not
let
himself
be
discourage
,
ask
leave
to
stay
and
hear
the
reading
of
paper
from
the
old
chest
,
and
actually
make
himself
useful
in
help
to
decipher
some
difficult
german
manuscript
.
<EOS>
this
lead
him
to
suggest
that
it
may
be
desirable
to
make
a
transcription
of
the
manuscript
,
and
he
offer
his
service
for
this
purpose
,
and
also
to
make
copy
of
any
paper
in
roman
character
.
<EOS>
though
Ezra
's
young
eye
he
observe
be
get
weak
,
his
own
be
still
strong
.
<EOS>
Deronda
accept
the
offer
,
think
that
Lapidoth
show
a
sign
of
grace
in
the
willingness
to
be
employ
usefully
;
and
he
see
a
gratified
expression
in
Ezra
's
face
,
who
,
however
,
presently
say
,
"
let
all
the
writing
be
do
here
;
for
I
can
not
trust
the
paper
out
of
my
sight
,
lest
there
be
an
accident
by
burn
or
otherwise
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Poor
Ezra
feel
very
much
as
if
he
have
a
convict
on
leave
under
his
charge
.
<EOS>
unless
he
see
his
father
work
,
it
be
not
possible
to
believe
that
he
would
work
in
good
faith
.
<EOS>
but
by
this
arrangement
he
fasten
on
himself
the
burden
of
his
father
's
presence
,
which
be
make
painful
not
only
through
his
deep
,
long
association
,
but
also
through
Lapidoth
's
restlessness
of
temperament
,
which
show
itself
the
more
as
he
become
familiarized
with
his
situation
,
and
lose
any
awe
he
have
feel
of
his
son
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
he
be
put
a
strong
constraint
on
himself
in
confine
his
attention
for
the
sake
of
win
Deronda
's
favor
;
and
like
a
man
in
an
uncomfortable
garment
he
give
himself
relief
at
every
opportunity
,
go
out
to
smoke
,
or
move
about
and
talk
,
or
throw
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
remain
silent
,
but
incessantly
carry
on
a
dumb
language
of
facial
movement
or
gesticulation
:
and
if
Mirah
be
in
the
room
,
he
would
fall
into
his
old
habit
of
talk
with
her
,
gossip
about
their
former
doing
and
companion
,
or
repeat
quirk
and
story
,
and
plot
of
the
play
he
use
to
adapt
,
in
the
belief
that
he
could
at
will
command
the
vivacity
of
his
early
time
.
<EOS>
all
this
be
a
mortal
infliction
to
Ezra
;
and
when
Mirah
be
at
home
she
try
to
relieve
him
,
by
get
her
father
down
into
the
parlor
and
keeping
watch
over
him
there
.
<EOS>
what
duty
be
make
of
a
single
difficult
resolve
?
<EOS>
the
difficulty
lie
in
the
daily
unflinching
support
of
consequence
that
mar
the
blessed
return
of
morning
with
the
prospect
of
irritation
to
be
suppress
or
shame
to
be
endure
.
<EOS>
and
such
consequence
be
be
bear
by
these
,
as
by
many
other
heroic
child
of
an
unworthy
father
 
with
the
prospect
,
at
least
to
Mirah
,
of
their
stretch
onward
through
the
solid
part
of
life
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
Lapidoth
's
presence
have
raise
a
new
impalpable
partition
between
Deronda
and
Mirah
 
each
of
them
dread
the
soil
inference
of
his
mind
,
each
of
them
interpret
mistakenly
the
increase
reserve
and
diffidence
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
very
long
before
some
light
come
to
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
could
,
after
return
from
his
brief
visit
to
the
Abbey
,
he
have
call
at
Hans
Meyrick
's
room
,
feel
it
,
on
more
ground
than
one
,
a
due
of
friendship
that
Hans
should
be
at
once
acquaint
with
the
reason
of
his
late
journey
,
and
the
change
of
intention
it
have
bring
about
.
<EOS>
Hans
be
not
there
;
he
be
say
to
be
in
the
country
for
a
few
day
;
and
Deronda
,
after
leave
a
note
,
wait
a
week
,
rather
expect
a
note
in
return
.
<EOS>
but
receive
no
word
,
and
fear
some
freak
of
feeling
in
the
incalculably
susceptible
Hans
,
whose
propose
sojourn
at
the
Abbey
he
know
have
be
defer
,
he
at
length
make
a
second
call
,
and
be
admit
into
the
painting
-
room
,
where
he
find
his
friend
in
a
light
coat
,
without
a
waistcoat
,
his
long
hair
still
wet
from
a
bath
,
but
with
a
face
look
wear
and
wizene
 
anything
but
country
-
like
.
<EOS>
He
have
take
up
his
palette
and
brush
,
and
stand
before
his
easel
when
Deronda
enter
,
but
the
equipment
and
attitude
seem
to
have
be
get
up
on
short
notice
.
  
<EOS>
as
they
shake
hand
,
Deronda
say
,
"
You
do
not
look
much
as

"
  
<EOS>
"
no

say
Hans
,
curtly
,
throw
down
his
palette
with
the
air
of
one
who
have
begin
to
feign
by
mistake
;
<EOS>
then
push
forward
a
chair
for
Deronda
,
he
throw
himself
into
another
,
and
lean
backward
with
his
hand
behind
his
head
,
while
he
go
on
,
"
I

You

who
have

himself
opposite
,
in
anxious
survey

<EOS>
"
nothing

<EOS>
I

I

how
much

have
find
myself

out

nothing

say
Hans
,
crease
his
face
into
a
smile
;

and
,
in
fact
,
I
be
tired
of
be
virtuous
without

in

nothing

<EOS>
Deronda
feel
convinced

artificially

he
trust
to
a

of
the
old

by
if

"
You
laugh
at
the
mystery

It
be
for
an
object

my

many

have
cause
me

almost
a

lay
one

usual
with

as
it
be
to

out

<EOS>
Hans

nothing

rise
,
seize
his

to
work
his

on

stand
before
his

his
back

at

again

low

without

no

perhaps
not

once

there

what
be
that

Hans

with
some
irritation

<EOS>
"
why
superfluous

<EOS>

<EOS>

han
look
round
hastily
at

immediately
turn
to
his

again

Deronda

hurt
by
the

Deronda
's
eagerness

hardly
have
have
a
strong
stimulus

Hans
have
give
it
in
his

need
relief

He
go
on

in

if

accept

he

Deronda
have

restlessness

recommend
himself

he
have
foreboding
of

some

,
or
some
intolerable
increase
of
domestic
disquietude
in
which
he
may
save

from

helpless
victim

<EOS>
His
foreboding
would
have
be
strengthen
if
he
have
know
what
be
go
on
in
the
father
's
mind

<EOS>
that
amount
of
restlessness
,
that
desultoriness
of
attention
,
which
make
a
small
torture
to
Ezra
,
be
to
lapidoth
an
irksome
submission
to
restraint
,
only
make
bearable
by
his
thinking
of
it
as
a
means
of
by
-
and
-
by
secure
a
well
-
condition
freedom
.
<EOS>
He
begin
with
the
intention
of
await
some
really
good
chance
,
such
as
an
opening
for
get
a
considerable
sum
from
Deronda
;
but
all
the
while
he
be
look
about
curiously
,
and
try
to
discover
where
Mirah
deposit
her
money
and
her
key
.
<EOS>
the
imperious
gambling
desire
within
him
,
which
carry
on
its
activity
through
every
other
occupation
,
and
make
a
continuous
web
of
imagination
that
hold
all
else
in

,
would
hardly
have
be
under
the
control
of
a
contract
purpose
,
if
he
have
be
able
to
lay
his
hand
on
any
sum
worth
capturing
.
<EOS>
but
Mirah
,
with
her
practical
clear
-
sightedness
,
guard
against
any
frustration
of
the
promise
she
have
give
to
Ezra
,
by
confide
all
money
,
except
what
she
be
immediately
in
want
of
,
to
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
care
,
and
Lapidoth
feel
himself
under
an
irritate
completeness
of
supply
in
kind
as
in
a
lunatic
asylum
where
everything
be
make
safe
against
him

<EOS>
to
have
open
a
desk
or
drawer
of
Mirah
's
,
and
pocket
any
bank
-
note
find
there
,
would
have
be
to
his
mind
a
sort
of
domestic
appropriation
which
have
no
disgrace
in
it
;
the
degree
of
liberty
a
man
allow
himself
with
other
people
's
property
be
often
delicately
draw
,
even
beyond
the
boundary
where
the

which
be
the
reason
why
spoon
be

<EOS>
Lapidoth
really
feel
himself
injuriously
treat
by

think
that
he
ought
to
have
have
what
he
want
of
her
other
earning
as
he
have
of
her
apple

tart

<EOS>
but
he
remain
submissive
;
indeed
,
the
indiscretion
that
most
tempt
him
,
be
not
any
insistance
with
Mirah
,
but
some
kind
of
appeal
to
Deronda
.
<EOS>
clever
person
who
have
nothing
else
to
sell
can
often
put
a
good
price
on
their
absence
,
and
Lapidoth
's
difficult
search
for
device
force
upon
him
the
idea
that
his
family
would
find
themselves
happy
without
him
,
and
that
Deronda
would
be
willing
to
advance
a
considerable
sum
for
the
sake
of
get
rid
of
him
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
spite
of
well
-
practice
hardihood
,
Lapidoth
be
still
in
some
awe
of
Ezra
's
impose
friend
,
and
defer
his
purpose
indefinitely
.
  
<EOS>
on
this
day
,
when
Deronda
have
come
full
of
a
gladden
consciousness
,
which
inevitably
show
itself
in
his
air
and
speech
,
Lapidoth
be
at
a
crisis
of
discontent
and
longing
that
make
his
mind
busy
with
scheme
of
freedom
,
and
Deronda
's
new
amenity
encourage
them
.
<EOS>
this
pre
-
occupation
be
at
last
so
strong
as
to
interfere
with
his
usual
show
of
interest
in
what
go
forward
,
and
his
persistence
in
sit
by
even
when
there
be
read
which
he
could
not
follow
.
<EOS>
after
sit
a
little
while
,
he
go
out
to
smoke
and
walk
in
the
square
,
and
the
two
friend
be
all
the
easy
.
<EOS>
Mirah
be
not
at
home
,
but
she
be
sure
to
be
in
again
before
Deronda
leave
,
and
his
eye
glow
with
a
secret
anticipation
<EOS>
:
he
think
that
when
he
see
her
again
he
should
see
some
sweetness
of
recognition
for
himself
to
which
his
eye
have
be
seal
before

<EOS>
there
be
an
additional
playful
affectionateness
in
his
manner
toward
Ezra

<EOS>
"
this
little
room
be
too
close

break
off
his

<EOS>
the
week
's
heat
<EOS>
we
sometimes
get
here
<EOS>
be
bad
than
the
heat
in
Genoa
,
where
one
sit
in
the
shaded
coolness
of
large
room

<EOS>
You
must
have
a
well
home
now

<EOS>
I
shall
do
as
I
like
with
you

be
the
strong
half
.
"
<EOS>
He
smile
toward
Ezra
,
who
say
    
"
I
be
straiten
for
nothing
except
breath
.
<EOS>
but
you
,
who
may
be
in
a
spacious
palace
,
with
the
wide
green
country
around
you
,
find
this
a
narrow
prison

<EOS>
nevertheless
,
I
can
not
say
,
"
go
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
oh
,
the
country
would
be
a
banishment
while
you
be
here
,
"
say
Deronda
,
rise
and
walk
round
the
double
room
,
which
yet
offer
no
long
promenade
,
while
he
make
a
great
fan
of
his
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
the
happy
room
in
the
world
to
me
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
will
imagine
myself
in
the
East
,
since
I
be
get
ready
to
go
there
some
day
.
<EOS>
only
I
will
not
wear
a
cravat
and
a
heavy
ring
there
,
"
he
end
emphatically
,
pause
to
take
off
those
superfluity
and
deposit
them
on
a
small
table
behind
Ezra
,
who
have
the
table
in
front
of
him
cover
with
book
and
paper
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
wear
my
memorable
ring
ever
since
I
come
home
,
"
he
go
on
,
as
he
reseat
himself
.
"
<EOS>
but
I
be
such
a
Sybarite
that
I
constantly
put
it
off
as
a
burden
when
I
be
do
anything
.
<EOS>
I
understand
why
the
Romans
have
summer
ring
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
if
_
they
have
them
.
<EOS>
now
then
,
I
shall
get
on
better
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
be
soon
absorb
in
their
work
again
.
<EOS>
Deronda
be
read
a
piece
of
rabbinical
Hebrew
under
Ezra
's
correction
and
comment
,
and
they
take
little
notice
when
Lapidoth
re
-
enter
and
take
a
seat
somewhat
in
the
background
.
  
<EOS>
His
rambling
eye
quickly
alight
on
the
ring
that
sparkle
on
the
bit
of
dark
mahogany
.
<EOS>
during
his
walk
,
his
mind
have
be
occupy
with
the
fiction
of
an
advantageous
opening
for
him
abroad
,
only
require
a
sum
of
ready
money
,
which
,
on
be
communicate
to
Deronda
in
private
,
may
immediately
draw
from
him
a
question
as
to
the
amount
of
the
required
sum
:
and
it
be
this
part
of
his
forecast
that
Lapidoth
find
the
most
debatable
,
there
be
a
danger
in
ask
too
much
,
and
a
prospective
regret
in
ask
too
little
.
<EOS>
His
own
desire
give
him
no
limit
,
and
he
be
quite
without
guidance
as
to
the
limit
of
Deronda
's
willingness
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
in
the
midst
of
these
airy
condition
preparatory
to
a
receipt
which
remain
indefinite
,
this
ring
,
which
on
Deronda
's
finger
have
become
familiar
to
Lapidoth
's
envy
,
suddenly
shine
detach
and
within
easy
grasp
.
<EOS>
Its
value
be
certainly
below
the
small
of
the
imaginary
sum
that
his
purpose
fluctuate
between
;
but
then
it
be
before
him
as
a
solid
fact
,
and
his
desire
at
once
leap
into
the
thought
(
not
yet
an
intention
)
that
if
he
be
quietly
to
pocket
that
ring
and
walk
away
he
would
have
the
mean
of
comfortable
escape
from
present
restraint
,
without
trouble
,
and
also
without
danger
;
for
any
property
of
Deronda
's
(
available
without
his
formal
consent
)
be
all
one
with
his
child
's
property
,
since
their
father
would
never
be
prosecute
for
take
it
.
<EOS>
the
detail
of
this
thinking
follow
each
other
so
quickly
that
they
seem
to
rise
before
him
as
one
picture
.
<EOS>
Lapidoth
have
never
commit
larceny
;
but
larceny
be
a
form
of
appropriation
for
which
people
be
punish
by
law
;
and
,
take
this
ring
from
a
virtual
relation
,
who
would
have
be
willing
to
make
a
much
heavy
gift
,
would
not
come
under
the
head
of
larceny
.
<EOS>
still
,
the
heavy
gift
be
to
be
prefer
,
if
Lapidoth
could
only
make
haste
enough
in
ask
for
it
,
and
the
imaginary
action
of
take
the
ring
,
which
keep
repeat
itself
like
an
inward
tune
,
sink
into
a
reject
idea
.
<EOS>
He
satisfy
his
urgent
longing
by
resolve
to
go
below
,
and
watch
for
the
moment
of
Deronda
's
departure
,
when
he
would
ask
leave
to
join
him
in
his
walk
and
boldly
carry
out
his
meditate
plan
.
<EOS>
He
rise
and
stand
look
out
of
the
window
,
but
all
the
while
he
see
what
lie
beyond
him
 
the
brief
passage
he
would
have
to
make
to
the
door
close
by
the
table
where
the
ring
be
.
<EOS>
however
he
be
resolve
to
go
down
;
but
 
by
no
distinct
change
of
resolution
,
rather
by
a
dominance
of
desire
,
like
the
thirst
of
the
drunkard
 
<EOS>
it
so
happen
that
in
pass
the
table
his
finger
fall
noiselessly
on
the
ring
,
and
he
find
himself
in
the
passage
with
the
ring
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
It
follow
that
he
put
on
his
hat
and
quit
the
house
.
<EOS>
the
possibility
of
again
throw
himself
on
his
child
recede
into
the
indefinite
distance
,
and
before
he
be
out
on
the
square
his
sense
of
haste
have
concentrate
itself
on
sell
the
ring
and
get
on
shipboard
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
and
Ezra
be
just
aware
of
his
exit
;
that
be
all

<EOS>
but
,
by
-
and
-
by
,
Mirah
come
in
and
make
a
real
interruption
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
take
off
her
hat
;
and
when
Deronda
rise
and
advance
to
shake
hand
with
her
,
she
say
,
in
a
confusion
at
once
unaccountable
and
troublesome
to
herself
    
<EOS>
"
I
only
come
in
to
see
that
Ezra
have
his
new
draught
.
<EOS>
I
must
go
directly
to
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
to
fetch
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
pray
allow
me
to
walk
with
you
,
"
say
Deronda
urgently
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
not
tire
Ezra
any
further
;
besides
my
brain
be
melt
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
go
to
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
:
may
I
go
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
"
say
Mirah
,
blush
still
more
,
with
the
vague
sense
of
something
new
in
Deronda
,
and
turn
away
to
pour
out
Ezra
's
draught
;
Ezra
meanwhile
throw
back
his
head
with
his
eye
shut
,
unable
to
get
his
mind
away
from
the
idea
that
have
be
fill
it
while
the
reading
be
go
on
.
<EOS>
Deronda
for
a
moment
stand
think
of
nothing
but
the
walk
,
till
Mirah
turn
round
again
and
bring
the
draught
,
when
he
suddenly
remember
that
he
have
lay
aside
his
cravat
,
and
say
 
"
pray
excuse
my
dishabille
 
I
do
not
mean
you
to
see
it
,
"
he
go
to
the
little
table
,
take
up
his
cravat
,
and
exclaim
with
a
violent
impulse
of
surprise
,
"
good
heaven
,
where
be
my
ring
go
?
"
<EOS>
begin
to
search
about
on
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
Ezra
look
round
the
corner
of
his
chair
.
<EOS>
Mirah
,
quick
as
thought
,
go
to
the
spot
where
Deronda
be
seek
,
and
say
,
"
do
you
lay
it
down
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Deronda
,
still
unvisited
by
any
other
explanation
than
that
the
ring
have
fall
and
be
lurk
in
shadow
,
indiscernable
on
the
variegate
carpet
.
<EOS>
He
be
move
the
bit
of
furniture
near
,
and
search
in
all
possible
and
impossible
place
with
hand
and
eye
.
  
<EOS>
but
another
explanation
have
visit
Mirah
and
take
the
color
from
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
She
go
to
Ezra
's
ear
and
whisper
"
<EOS>
be
my
father
here
?
"
<EOS>
He
bend
his
head
in
reply
,
meet
her
eye
with
terrible
understanding
.
<EOS>
She
dart
back
to
the
spot
where
Deronda
be
still
cast
down
his
eye
in
that
hopeless
exploration
which
be
apt
to
carry
on
over
a
space
we
have
examine
in
vain
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
find
it
?
<EOS>
"
she
say
,
hurriedly
.
  
<EOS>
He
,
meet
her
frightened
gaze
,
immediately
catch
alarm
from
it
and
answer
,
"
I
perhaps
put
it
in
my
pocket
,
"
profess
to
feel
for
it
there
.
  
<EOS>
She
watch
him
and
say
,
"
It
be
not
there
?
 
<EOS>
you
put
it
on
the
table
,
"
with
a
penetrating
voice
that
would
not
let
him
feign
to
have
find
it
in
his
pocket
;
and
immediately
she
rush
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Deronda
follow
her
 
<EOS>
she
be
go
into
the
sitting
-
room
below
to
look
for
her
father
 
<EOS>
she
open
the
door
of
the
bedroom
to
see
if
he
be
there
 
<EOS>
she
look
where
his
hat
usually
hang
 
<EOS>
she
turn
with
her
hand
<EOS>
clasp
tight
and
her
lip
pale
,
gaze
despairingly
out
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
then
she
look
up
at
Deronda
,
who
have
not
dare
to
speak
to
her
in
her
white
agitation
.
<EOS>
She
look
up
at
him
,
unable
to
utter
a
word
 
<EOS>
the
look
seem
a
tacit
acceptance
of
the
humiliation
she
feel
in
his
presence
.
<EOS>
but
he
,
take
her
clasped
hand
between
both
his
,
say
,
in
a
tone
of
reverent
adoration
    
"
Mirah
,
let
me
think
that
he
be
my
father
as
well
as
yours
 
<EOS>
that
we
can
have
no
sorrow
,
no
disgrace
,
no
joy
apart
.
<EOS>
I
will
rather
take
your
grief
to
be
mine
than
I
would
take
the
bright
joy
of
another
woman

<EOS>
say
you
will
not
reject
me
 
say
you
will
take
me
to
share
all
thing
with
you

<EOS>
say
you
will
promise
to
be
my
wife

it
now

<EOS>
I
have
be
in
doubt
<EOS>
so
long
 
I
have
have
to
hide
my
love
so
long

<EOS>
say
that
now
<EOS>
and
always
I
may
prove
to
you
that
I
love
you
with
complete
love

"
  
<EOS>
the
change
in
Mirah
have
be
gradual
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
pass
at
once
from
anguish
to
the
full
,
blessed
consciousness
that
,
in
this
moment
of
grief
and
shame
,
Deronda
be
give
her
the
high
tribute
man
can
give
to
woman
.
<EOS>
with
the
first
tone
and
the
first
word
,
she
have
only
a
sense
of
solemn
comfort
,
refer
this
goodness
of
Deronda
's
to
his
feeling
for
Ezra
.
<EOS>
but
by
degree
the
rapturous
assurance
of
unhoped
-
for
good
take
possession
of
her
frame
:
her
face
glow
under
Deronda
's
as
he
bend
over
her
;
yet
she
look
up
still
with
intense
gravity
,
as
when
she
have
first
acknowledge
with
religious
gratitude
that
he
have
think
her
"
worthy
of
the
good
;
"
and
when
he
have
finish
,
she
could
say
nothing
 
<EOS>
she
could
only
lift
up
her
lip
to
his
and
just
kiss
them
,
as
if
that

simple
"
yes

They

between

happy

so
fully
in
their
new
consciousness
that
all
sign
would
have
seem
to
throw
them
farther
apart

till

say
in
a
whisper
:

and
comfort

WORDSWORTH
:
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
the
Prelude
<EOS>
_
.
   
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
carry
out
his
plan
of
spend
part
of
the
autumn
at
Diplow
,
and
by
the
beginning
of
October
his
presence
be
spread
some
cheerfulness
in
the
neighborhood
,
among
all
rank
and
person
concern
,
from
the
stately
home
of
Brackenshaw
and
Quetcham
to
the
respectable
shop
-
parlor
in
Wanchester
.
<EOS>
for
Sir
Hugo
be
a
man
who
like
to
show
himself
and
be
affable
,
a
liberal
of
good
lineage
,
who
confide
entirely
in
reform
as
not
likely
to
make
any
serious
difference
in
english
habit
of
feeling
,
<EOS>
one
of
which
undoubtedly
be
the
like
to
behold
society
well
fence
and
adorn
with
hereditary
rank
.
<EOS>
hence
he
make
Diplow
a
most
agreeable
house
,
extend
his
invitation
to
old
Wanchester
solicitor
and
young
village
curate
,
but
also
take
some
care
in
the
combination
of
the
guest
,
and
not
feed
all
the
common
poultry
together
,
so
that
they
should
think
their
meal
no
particular
compliment
.
<EOS>
easy
-
go
Lord
Brackenshaw
,
for
example
,
would
not
mind
meet
Robinson
the
attorney
,
but
Robinson
would
have
be
naturally
pique
if
he
have
be
ask
to
meet
a
set
of
people
who
pass
for
his
equal
.
<EOS>
on
all
these
point
Sir
Hugo
be
well
inform
enough
at
once
to
gain
popularity
for
himself
and
give
pleasure
to
other
 
two
result
which
eminently
suit
his
disposition
.
<EOS>
the
rector
of
Pennicote
now
find
a
reception
at
Diplow
very
different
from
the
haughty
tolerance
he
have
undergo
during
the
reign
of
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
the
baronet
like
Mr.
Gascoigne
;
it
be
that
he
desire
to
keep
up
a
marked
relation
of
friendliness
with
him
on
account
of
Mrs.
Grandcourt
,
for
whom
Sir
Hugo
's
chivalry
have
become
more
and
more
engaged
.
<EOS>
why
?
<EOS>
the
chief
reason
be
one
that
he
could
not
fully
communicate
,
even
to
<EOS>
Lady
Mallinger
 
<EOS>
for
he
would
not
tell
what
he
think
one
woman
's
secret
to
another
,
even
though
the
other
be
his
wife
 
which
show
that
his
chivalry
include
a
rare
reticence
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
,
after
he
have
become
engage
to
Mirah
,
feel
it
right
to
make
a
full
statement
of
his
position
and
purpose
to
Sir
Hugo
,
and
he
choose
to
make
it
by
letter
.
<EOS>
He
have
more
than
a
presentiment
that
his
fatherly
friend
would
feel
some
dissatisfaction
,
if
not
pain
,
at
this
turn
of
his
destiny
.
<EOS>
in
read
unwelcome
news
,
instead
of
hear
it
,
there
be
the
advantage
that
one
avoid
a
hasty
expression
of
impatience
which
may
afterward
be
repent
of
.
<EOS>
Deronda
dread
that
verbal
collision
which
make
otherwise
pardonable
feeling
lastingly
offensive
.
  
<EOS>
and
Sir
Hugo
,
though
not
altogether
surprised
,
be
thoroughly
vexed
.
<EOS>
His
immediate
resource
be
to
take
the
letter
to
Lady
Mallinger
,
who
would
be
sure
to
express
an
astonishment
which
her
husband
could
argue
against
as
unreasonable
,
and
in
this
way
divide
the
stress
of
his
discontent
.
<EOS>
and
in
fact
when
she
show
herself
astonish
and
distress
that
all
Daniel
's
wonderful
talent
,
and
the
comfort
of
have
him
in
the
house
,
should
have
end
in
his
go
mad
in
this
way
about
the
Jews
,
the
baronet
could
say
    
"
<EOS>
oh
,
nonsense
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
depend
upon
it
,
Dan
will
not
make
a
fool
of
himself
.
<EOS>
He
have
large
notion
about
judaism
 
political
view
which
you
can
not
understand
.
<EOS>
no
fear
but
Dan
will
keep
himself
head
uppermost
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
with
regard
to
the
prospective
marriage
she
afford
him
no
counter
-
irritant
.
<EOS>
the
gentle
lady
observe
,
without
rancor
,
that
she
have
little
dream
of
what
be
come
when
she
have
Mirah
to
sing
at
her
musical
party
and
give
lesson
to
Amabel
.
<EOS>
after
some
hesitation
,
indeed
,
she
confess
it
_
have
_
pass
through
her
mind
that
after
a
proper
time
Daniel
may
marry
Mrs.
Grandcourt
 
because
it
seem
so
remarkable
that
he
should
be
at
Genoa
just
at
that
time
 
<EOS>
and
although
she
herself
be
not
fond
of
widow
she
could
not
help
think
that
such
a
marriage
would
have
be
well
than
his
go
altogether
with
the
Jews
.
<EOS>
but
Sir
Hugo
be
so
strongly
of
the
same
opinion
that
he
could
not
correct
it
as
a
feminine
mistake
;
and
his
ill
-
humor
at
the
disproof
of
his
disagreeable
conclusion
on
behalf
of
Gwendolen
be
leave
without
vent
.
<EOS>
He
desire
Lady
Mallinger
not
to
breathe
a
word
about
the
affair
till
further
notice
,
say
to
himself
,
"
if
it
be
an
unkind
cut
to
the
poor
thing
(
mean
Gwendolen
)
,
the
longer
she
be
without
know
it
the
well
,
in
her
present
nervous
state
.
<EOS>
and
she
will
best
learn
it
from
Dan
himself
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
's
conjecture
have
work
so
industriously
with
his
knowledge
,
that
he
fancy
himself
well
inform
concern
the
whole
situation
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
his
residence
with
his
family
at
Diplow
enable
him
to
continue
his
fatherly
attention
to
Gwendolen
;
and
in
these
Lady
Mallinger
,
notwithstanding
her
small
liking
for
widow
,
be
quite
willing
to
second
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
plan
of
removal
to
Offendene
have
be
carry
out
;
and
Gwendolen
,
in
settle
there
,
maintain
a
calm
beyond
her
mother
's
hope
.
<EOS>
She
be
experience
some
of
that
peaceful
melancholy
which
come
from
the
renunciation
of
demand
for
self
,
and
from
take
the
ordinary
good
of
existence
,
and
especially
kindness
,
even
from
a
dog
,
as
a
gift
above
expectation
.
<EOS>
do
one
who
have
be
all
but
lose
in
a
pit
of
darkness
complain
of
the
sweet
air
and
the
daylight
?
<EOS>
there
be
a
way
of
look
at
our
life
daily
as
an
escape
,
and
take
the
quiet
return
of
morn
and
evening
 
still
more
the
star
-
like
out
-
glowing
of
some
pure
fellow
-
feeling
,
some
generous
impulse
break
our
inward
darkness
 
as
a
salvation
that
reconcile
us
to
hardship
.
<EOS>
those
who
have
a
self
-
knowledge
prompting
such
self
-
accusation
as
Hamlet
's
,
can
understand
this
habitual
feeling
of
rescue
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
feel
by
Gwendolen
as
she
live
through
and
through
again
the
terrible
history
of
her
temptation
,
from
their
first
form
of
illusory
self
-
pleasing
when
she
struggle
away
from
the
hold
of
conscience
,
to
their
late
form
of
an
urgent
hatred
drag
her
toward
its
satisfaction
,
while
she
pray
and
cry
for
the
help
of
that
conscience
which
she
have
once
forsake
.
<EOS>
She
be
now
dwell
on
every
word
of
Deronda
's
that
point
to
her
past
deliverance
from
the
bad
evil
in
herself
,
and
the
bad
infliction
of
it
on
other
,
and
on
every
word
that
carry
a
force
to
resist
self
-
despair
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
be
also
upborne
by
the
prospect
of
soon
see
him
again
:
she
do
not
imagine
him
otherwise
than
always
within
her
reach
,
her
supreme
need
of
him
blind
her
to
the
separateness
of
his
life
,
the
whole
scene
of
which
she
fill
with
his
relation
to
her
 
no
unique
preoccupation
of
Gwendolen
's
,
for
we
be
all
apt
to
fall
into
this
passionate
egoism
of
imagination
,
not
only
toward
our
fellow
-
man
,
but
toward
God
.
<EOS>
and
the
future
which
she
turn
her
face
to
with
a
willing
step
be
one
where
she
would
be
continually
assimilate
herself
to
some
type
that
he
would
hold
before
her
.
<EOS>
have
he
not
first
rise
on
her
vision
as
a
corrective
presence
which
she
have
recognize
in
the
beginning
with
resentment
,
and
at
last
with
entire
love
and
trust
?
<EOS>
She
could
not
spontaneously
think
of
an
end
to
that
reliance
,
which
have
become
to
her
imagination
like
the
firmness
of
the
earth
,
the
only
condition
of
her
walking
.
  
<EOS>
and
Deronda
be
not
long
before
he
come
to
Diplow
,
which
be
a
more
convenient
distance
from
town
than
the
Abbey
.
<EOS>
He
have
wish
to
carry
out
a
plan
for
take
Ezra
and
Mirah
to
a
mild
spot
on
the
coast
,
while
he
prepare
another
home
which
Mirah
may
enter
as
his
bride
,
and
where
they
may
unitedly
watch
over
her
brother
.
<EOS>
but
Ezra
beg
not
to
be
remove
,
unless
it
be
to
go
with
them
to
the
East
.
<EOS>
all
outward
solicitation
be
become
more
and
more
of
a
burden
to
him
;
but
his
mind
dwell
on
the
possibility
of
this
voyage
with
a
visionary
joy
.
<EOS>
Deronda
,
in
his
preparation
for
the
marriage
,
which
he
hope
may
not
be
defer
beyond
a
couple
of
month
,
wish
to
have
full
consultation
as
to
his
resource
and
affair
generally
with
Sir
Hugo
,
and
here
be
a
reason
for
not
delay
his
visit
to
Diplow
.
<EOS>
but
he
think
quite
as
much
of
another
reason
 
his
promise
to
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
the
sense
of
blessedness
in
his
own
lot
have
yet
an
ache
anxiety
at
his
heart
:
this
may
be
hold
paradoxical
,
for
the
beloved
lover
be
always
call
happy
,
and
happiness
be
consider
as
a
well
-
flesh
indifference
to
sorrow
outside
it
.
<EOS>
but
human
experience
be
usually
paradoxical
,
if
that
mean
incongruous
with
the
phrase
of
current
talk
or
even
current
philosophy
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
treason
to
Mirah
,
but
a
part
of
that
full
nature
which
make
his
love
for
her
the
more
worthy
,
that
his
joy
in
her
could
hold
by
its
side
the
care
for
another
.
<EOS>
for
what
be
love
itself
,
for
the
one
we
love
best
?
 
<EOS>
an
enfolding
of
immeasurable
care
which
yet
be
well
than
any
joy
outside
our
love
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
come
twice
to
Diplow
,
and
see
Gwendolen
twice
 
<EOS>
and
yet
he
go
back
to
town
without
have
tell
her
anything
about
the
change
in
his
lot
and
prospect
.
<EOS>
He
blame
himself
;
but
in
all
momentous
communication
likely
to
give
pain
<EOS>
we
feel
dependent
on
some
preparatory
turn
of
word
or
association
,
some
agreement
of
the
other
's
mood
with
the
probable
effect
of
what
we
have
to
impart
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
interview
Gwendolen
be
so
absorb
in
what
she
have
to
say
to
him
,
so
full
of
question
which
he
must
answer
,
about
the
arrangement
of
her
life
,
what
she
could
do
to
make
herself
less
ignorant
,
how
she
could
be
kind
to
everybody
,
and
make
amend
for
her
selfishness
and
try
to
be
rid
of
it
,
that
Deronda
utterly
shrink
from
waive
her
immediate
want
in
order
to
speak
of
himself
,
nay
,
from
inflict
a
wound
on
her
in
these
moment
when
she
be
lean
on
him
for
help
in
her
path
.
<EOS>
in
the
second
interview
,
when
he
go
with
new
resolve
to
command
the
conversation
into
some
preparatory
track
,
he
find
her
in
a
state
of
deep
depression
,
overmaster
by
some
distasteful
miserable
memory
which
force
themselves
on
her
as
something
more
real
and
ample
than
any
new
material
out
of
which
she
could
mould
her
future
.
<EOS>
She
cry
hysterically
,
and
say
that
he
would
always
despise
her
.
<EOS>
He
could
only
seek
word
of
soothing
and
encouragement
:
and
when
she
gradually
revive
under
them
,
with
that
pathetic
look
of
renew
childlike
interest
which
we
see
in
eye
where
the
lash
be
still
bead
with
tear
,
it
be
impossible
to
lay
another
burden
on
her
.
  
<EOS>
but
time
go
on
,
and
he
feel
it
a
press
duty
to
make
the
difficult
disclosure
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
it
be
true
,
never
recognize
his
have
any
affair
;
and
it
have
never
even
occur
to
her
to
ask
him
why
he
happen
to
be
at
Genoa
.
<EOS>
but
this
unconsciousness
of
her
would
make
a
sudden
revelation
of
affair
that
be
determine
his
course
in
life
all
the
heavy
blow
to
her
;
and
if
he
leave
the
revelation
to
be
make
by
different
person
,
she
would
feel
that
he
have
treat
her
with
cruel
inconsiderateness
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
make
the
communication
in
writing
:
his
tenderness
could
not
bear
to
think
of
her
read
his
virtual
farewell
in
solitude
,
and
perhaps
feel
his
word
full
of
a
hard
gladness
for
himself
and
indifference
for
her
.
<EOS>
He
go
down
to
Diplow
again
,
feel
that
every
other
peril
be
to
be
incur
rather
than
that
of
return
and
leave
her
still
in
ignorance
.
  
<EOS>
on
this
third
visit
Deronda
find
Hans
Meyrick
instal
with
his
easel
at
Diplow
,
begin
his
picture
of
the
three
daughter
sit
on
a
bank
,
"
in
the
Gainsborough
style
,
"
and
vary
his
work
by
ramble
to
Pennicote
to
sketch
the
village
child
and
improve
his
acquaintance
with
the
Gascoignes
.
<EOS>
han
appear
to
have
recover
his
vivacity
,
but
Deronda
detect
some
feigning
in
it
,
as
we
detect
the
artificiality
of
a
lady
's
bloom
from
its
be
a
little
too
high
-
toned
and
steadily
persistent
(
a
"
Fluctuating
Rouge
"
not
have
yet
appear
among
the
advertisement
)
.
<EOS>
also
with
all
his
grateful
friendship
and
admiration
for
Deronda
,
Hans
could
not
help
a
certain
irritation
against
him
,
such
as
extremely
incautious
,
open
nature
be
apt
to
feel
when
the
breaking
of
a
friend
's
reserve
disclose
a
state
of
thing
not
merely
unsuspected
but
the
reverse
of
what
have
be
hope
and
ingeniously
conjecture
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
poor
Hans
have
always
care
chiefly
to
confide
in
Deronda
,
and
have
be
quite
incurious
as
to
any
confidence
that
may
have
be
give
in
return
;
but
what
outpourer
of
his
own
affair
be
not
tempt
to
think
any
hint
of
his
friend
's
affair
be
an
egotistic
irrelevance
?
<EOS>
that
be
no
reason
why
it
be
not
rather
a
sore
reflection
to
Hans
that
while
he
have
be
all
along
naively
open
his
heart
about
Mirah
,
Deronda
have
keep
secret
a
feeling
of
rivalry
which
now
reveal
itself
as
the
important
determine
fact
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
it
be
always
at
their
peril
that
our
friend
turn
out
to
be
something
more
than
we
be
aware
of
.
<EOS>
han
must
be
excuse
for
these
prompting
of
bruise
sensibility
,
since
he
have
not
allow
them
to
govern
his
substantial
conduct
:
he
have
the
consciousness
of
have
do
right
by
his
fortunate
friend
;
or
,
as
he
tell
himself
,
"
his
metal
have
give
a
well
ring
than
he
would
have
swear
to
beforehand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
for
Hans
have
always
say
that
in
point
of
virtue
he
be
a
_
dilettante
_
:
which
mean
that
he
be
very
fond
of
it
in
other
people
,
but
if
he
meddle
with
it
himself
he
cut
a
poor
figure
.
<EOS>
perhaps
in
reward
of
his
good
behavior
he
give
his
tongue
the
more
freedom
;
and
he
be
too
fully
possess
by
the
notion
of
Deronda
's
happiness
to
have
a
conception
of
what
he
be
feel
about
Gwendolen
,
so
that
he
speak
of
her
without
hesitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
do
you
come
down
,
Hans
?
"
say
Deronda
,
join
him
in
the
ground
where
he
be
make
a
study
of
the
requisite
bank
and
tree
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
ten
day
ago
<EOS>
;
before
the
time
Sir
Hugo
fix
.
<EOS>
I
run
down
with
Rex
Gascoigne
and
stay
at
the
rectory
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
I
be
up
in
all
the
gossip
of
these
part
;
I
know
the
state
of
the
wheelwright
's
interior
,
and
have
assist
at
an
infant
school
examination
.
<EOS>
Sister
Anna
,
with
the
good
upper
lip
,
escort
me
,
else
I
should
have
be
mob
by
three
urchin
and
an
idiot
,
because
of
my
long
hair
and
a
general
appearance
which
depart
from
the
Pennicote
type
of
the
beautiful
.
<EOS>
altogether
,
the
village
be
idyllic
.
<EOS>
Its
only
fault
be
a
dark
curate
with
broad
shoulder
and
broad
trouser
who
ought
to
have
go
into
the
heavy
drapery
line
.
<EOS>
the
gascoigne
be
perfect
 
besides
be
relate
to
the
Vandyke
duchess
.
<EOS>
I
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
in
her
black
robe
at
a
distance
,
though
she
do
not
show
to
visitor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
not
stay
at
the
rectory
?
"
say
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
but
I
be
take
to
Offendene
to
see
the
old
house
,
and
as
a
consequence
I
see
the
duchess
'
family
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
have
be
there
and
know
all
about
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
have
be
there
,
"
say
Deronda
,
quietly
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
fine
old
place
.
<EOS>
an
excellent
setting
for
a
widow
with
romantic
fortune
.
<EOS>
and
she
seem
to
have
have
several
romance
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
find
out
that
there
be
one
between
her
and
my
friend
Rex
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
long
before
her
marriage
,
then
?
"
say
Deronda
,
really
interested
,
"
for
they
have
only
be
a
year
at
Offendene
.
<EOS>
how
come
you
to
know
anything
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
 
not
ignorant
of
what
it
be
to
be
a
miserable
devil
,
I
learn
to
gloat
on
the
sign
of
misery
in
other
.
<EOS>
I
find
out
that
Rex
never
go
to
Offendene
,
and
have
never
see
the
duchess
since
she
come
back
;
and
Miss
Gascoigne
let
fall
something
in
our
talk
about
charade
-
act
 
for
<EOS>
I
go
through
some
of
my
nonsense
to
please
the
young
one
 
something
that
prove
to
me
that
Rex
be
once
hover
about
his
fair
cousin
<EOS>
close
enough
to
get
singe
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
be
her
part
in
the
affair
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
duke
come
in
and
carry
her
off
.
<EOS>
that
be
always
the
way
when
an
exceptionally
worthy
young
man
form
an
attachment
.
<EOS>
I
understand
now
why
Gascoigne
talk
of
make
the
law
his
mistress
and
remain
a
bachelor
.
<EOS>
but
these
be
green
resolve
.
<EOS>
since
the
duke
do
not
get
himself
drown
for
your
sake
,
it
may
turn
out
to
be
for
my
friend
Rex
's
sake
.
<EOS>
who
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
absolutely
necessary
that
Mrs.
Grandcourt
should
marry
again
?
"
say
Deronda
,
ready
to
add
that
Hans
's
success
in
construct
her
fortune
hitherto
have
not
be
enough
to
warrant
a
new
attempt
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
monster
!
"
<EOS>
retort
Hans
,
"
do
you
want
her
to
wear
weed
for
_
<EOS>
you
_
<EOS>
all
her
life
 
burn
herself
in
perpetual
suttee
while
you
be
alive
and
merry
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
could
say
nothing
,
but
he
look
so
much
annoyed
that
Hans
turn
the
current
of
his
chat
,
and
when
he
be
alone
shrug
his
shoulder
a
little
over
the
thought
that
there
really
have
be
some
strong
feeling
between
Deronda
and
the
duchess
than
Mirah
would
like
to
know
of
.
<EOS>
"
why
do
not
she
fall
in
love
with
me
?
"
<EOS>
think
Hans
,
laugh
at
himself
.
<EOS>
"
She
would
have
have
no
rival
.
<EOS>
no
woman
ever
want
to
discuss
theology
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
no
wonder
that
Deronda
wince
under
that
sort
of
joke
with
a
whip
-
lash
.
<EOS>
It
touch
sensibility
that
be
already
quiver
with
the
anticipation
of
witness
some
of
that
pain
to
which
even
Hans
's
light
word
seem
to
give
more
reality
:
 
any
sort
of
recognition
by
another
give
emphasis
to
the
subject
of
our
anxiety
.
<EOS>
and
now
he
have
come
down
with
the
firm
resolve
that
he
would
not
again
evade
the
trial
.
<EOS>
the
next
day
he
ride
to
Offendene
.
<EOS>
He
have
send
word
that
he
intend
to
call
and
to
ask
if
Gwendolen
could
receive
him
;
and
he
find
her
await
him
in
the
old
drawing
-
room
where
some
chief
crisis
of
her
life
have
happen
.
<EOS>
She
seem
less
sad
than
he
have
see
her
since
her
husband
's
death
;
there
be
no
smile
on
her
face
,
but
a
placid
self
-
possession
,
in
contrast
with
the
mood
in
which
he
have
last
find
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
all
the
more
alive
to
the
sadness
perceptible
in
Deronda
;
and
they
be
no
sooner
seated
 
he
at
a
little
distance
opposite
to
her
 
than
she
say
:
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
afraid
of
come
to
see
me
,
because
I
be
so
full
of
grief
and
despair
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
so
today
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
sorry
ever
since
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
make
it
a
reason
why
I
should
keep
up
my
hope
and
be
as
cheerful
as
I
can
,
because
I
would
not
give
you
any
pain
about
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
an
unwonted
sweetness
in
Gwendolen
's
tone
and
look
as
she
utter
these
word
that
seem
to
Deronda
to
infuse
the
utmost
cruelty
into
the
task
now
lay
upon
him
.
<EOS>
but
he
feel
obliged
to
make
his
answer
a
beginning
of
the
task
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
_
be
_
in
some
trouble
to
-
day
,
"
he
say
,
look
at
her
rather
mournfully
;
"
but
it
be
because
I
have
thing
to
tell
you
which
you
will
almost
think
it
a
want
of
confidence
on
my
part
not
to
have
speak
of
before
.
<EOS>
They
be
thing
affect
my
own
life
 
my
own
future
.
<EOS>
I
shall
seem
to
have
make
an
ill
return
to
you
for
the
trust
you
have
place
in
me
 
never
to
have
give
you
an
idea
of
event
that
make
great
change
for
me
.
<EOS>
but
when
we
have
be
together
we
have
hardly
have
time
to
enter
into
subject
which
at
the
moment
be
really
less
pressing
to
me
than
the
trial
you
have
be
go
through
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
sort
of
timid
tenderness
in
Deronda
's
deep
tone
,
and
he
pause
with
a
plead
look
,
as
if
it
have
be
Gwendolen
only
who
have
confer
anything
in
her
scene
of
beseeching
and
confession
.
  
<EOS>
a
thrill
of
surprise
be
visible
in
her
.
<EOS>
such
meaning
as
she
find
in
his
word
have
shake
her
,
but
without
cause
fear
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
have
fly
at
once
to
some
change
in
his
position
with
regard
to
Sir
Hugo
and
Sir
Hugo
's
property
.
<EOS>
She
say
,
with
a
sense
of
comfort
from
Deronda
's
way
of
ask
her
pardon
    
<EOS>
"
You
never
think
of
anything
<EOS>
but
what
you
could
do
to
help
me
;
and
I
be
so
troublesome
.
<EOS>
how
could
you
tell
me
thing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
perhaps
astonish
you
,
"
say
Deronda
,
"
that
I
have
only
quite
lately
know
who
be
my
parent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
be
not
astonish
:
she
feel
the
more
assured
that
her
expectation
of
what
be
come
be
right
.
<EOS>
Deronda
go
on
without
check
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
reason
why
you
find
me
in
Italy
be
that
I
have
go
there
to
learn
that
 
in
fact
,
to
meet
my
mother
.
<EOS>
It
be
by
her
wish
that
I
be
bring
up
in
ignorance
of
my
parentage
.
<EOS>
She
part
with
me
after
my
father
's
death
,
when
I
be
a
little
creature
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
now
very
ill
,
and
she
feel
that
the
secrecy
ought
not
to
be
any
longer
maintain
.
<EOS>
Her
chief
reason
have
be
that
she
do
not
wish
me
to
know
I
be
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
_
a
Jew
_
!
"
<EOS>
Gwendolen
exclaim
,
in
a
low
tone
of
amazement
,
with
an
utterly
frustrated
look
,
as
if
some
confusing
potion
be
creep
through
her
system
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
color
,
and
do
not
speak
,
while
Gwendolen
,
with
her
eye
fix
on
the
floor
,
be
struggle
to
find
her
way
in
the
dark
by
the
aid
of
various
reminiscence
.
<EOS>
She
seem
at
last
to
have
arrive
at
some
judgment
,
for
she
look
up
at
Deronda
again
and
say
,
as
if
remonstrate
against
the
mother
's
conduct
    
<EOS>
"
what
difference
need
that
have
make
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
have
make
a
great
difference
to
me
that
I
have
know
it
,
"
say
Deronda
,
emphatically
;
but
he
could
not
go
on
easily
 
the
distance
between
her
idea
and
his
act
like
a
difference
of
native
language
,
make
him
uncertain
what
force
his
word
would
carry
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
meditate
again
,
and
then
say
feelingly
,
"
I
hope
there
be
nothing
to
make
you
mind
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
be
just
the
same
as
if
you
be
not
a
Jew
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
mean
to
assure
him
that
nothing
of
that
external
sort
could
affect
the
way
in
which
she
regard
him
,
or
the
way
in
which
he
could
influence
her
.
<EOS>
Deronda
be
a
little
help
by
this
misunderstanding
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
discovery
be
far
from
be
painful
to
me
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
have
be
gradually
prepare
for
it
,
and
I
be
glad
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
prepare
for
it
by
become
intimate
with
a
very
remarkable
Jew
,
whose
idea
have
attract
me
so
much
that
I
think
of
devote
the
good
part
of
my
life
to
some
effort
at
give
them
effect
.
"
  
<EOS>
again
Gwendolen
seem
shake
 
again
there
be
a
look
of
frustration
,
but
this
time
it
be
mingle
with
alarm
.
<EOS>
She
look
at
Deronda
with
lip
childishly
part
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
she
have
yet
connect
his
word
with
Mirah
and
her
brother
,
but
that
they
have
inspire
her
with
a
dreadful
presentiment
of
mountainous
travel
for
her
mind
before
it
could
reach
Deronda
's
.
<EOS>
great
idea
in
general
which
she
have
attribute
to
him
seem
to
make
no
great
practical
difference
,
and
be
not
formidable
in
the
same
way
as
these
mysteriously
-
shadow
particular
idea
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
quite
divine
what
be
go
on
within
her
;
he
could
only
seek
the
least
abrupt
path
of
disclosure
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
an
object
,
"
he
say
,
after
a
moment
,
"
which
will
by
-
and
-
by
force
me
to
leave
England
for
some
time
 
for
some
year
.
<EOS>
I
have
purpose
which
will
take
me
to
the
East
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
be
something
clear
,
but
all
the
more
immediately
agitate
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
lip
begin
to
tremble
.
"
<EOS>
but
you
will
come
back
?
<EOS>
"
she
say
,
taste
her
own
tear
as
they
fall
,
before
she
think
of
dry
them
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
could
not
sit
still
.
<EOS>
He
rise
,
and
go
to
prop
himself
against
the
corner
of
the
mantel
-
piece
,
at
a
different
angle
from
her
face
.
<EOS>
but
when
she
have
press
her
handkerchief
against
her
cheek
,
she
turn
and
look
up
at
him
,
await
an
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
live
,
"
say
Deronda
 
<EOS>
"
_
<EOS>
some
time
_
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
be
both
silent
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
persuade
himself
to
say
more
unless
she
lead
up
to
it
by
a
question
;
and
she
be
apparently
meditate
something
that
she
have
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
you
go
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
,
at
last
,
very
mildly
.
"
<EOS>
Can
I
understand
the
idea
,
or
be
I
too
ignorant
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
to
the
East
to
become
better
acquaint
with
the
condition
of
my
race
in
various
country
there
,
"
say
Deronda
,
gently
 
anxious
to
be
as
explanatory
as
he
could
on
what
be
the
impersonal
part
of
their
separateness
from
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
idea
that
I
be
possess
with
be
that
of
restore
a
political
existence
to
my
people
,
make
them
a
nation
again
,
give
them
a
national
center
,
such
as
the
English
have
,
though
they
too
be
scatter
over
the
face
of
the
globe
.
<EOS>
that
be
a
task
which
present
itself
to
me
as
a
duty
;
I
be
resolve
to
begin
it
,
however
feebly
.
<EOS>
I
be
resolve
to
devote
my
life
to
it
.
<EOS>
at
the
least
,
I
may
awaken
a
movement
in
other
mind
,
such
as
have
be
awaken
in
my
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
long
silence
between
them
.
<EOS>
the
world
seem
get
large
round
poor
Gwendolen
,
and
she
more
solitary
and
helpless
in
the
midst
.
<EOS>
the
thought
that
he
may
come
back
after
go
to
the
East
,
sink
before
the
bewilder
vision
of
these
wild
-
stretch
purpose
in
which
she
feel
herself
reduce
to
a
mere
speck
.
<EOS>
there
come
a
terrible
moment
to
many
soul
when
the
great
movement
of
the
world
,
the
large
destiny
of
mankind
,
which
have
lie
aloof
in
newspaper
and
other
neglect
reading
,
enter
like
an
earthquake
into
their
own
life
 
where
the
slow
urgency
of
grow
generation
turn
into
the
tread
of
an
invade
army
or
the
dire
clash
of
civil
war
,
and
gray
father
know
nothing
to
seek
for
but
the
corpse
of
their
blooming
son
,
and
girl
forget
all
vanity
to
make
lint
and
bandage
which
may
serve
for
the
shatter
limb
of
their
betroth
husband
.
<EOS>
then
it
be
as
if
the
Invisible
Power
that
have
be
the
object
of
lip
-
worship
and
lip
-
resignation
become
visible
,
accord
to
the
imagery
of
the
hebrew
poet
,
make
the
flame
his
chariot
,
and
ride
on
the
wing
of
the
wind
,
till
the
mountain
smoke
and
the
plain
shudder
under
the
rolling
fiery
visitation
.
<EOS>
often
the
good
cause
seem
to
lie
prostrate
under
the
thunder
of
relent
force
,
the
martyr
live
revile
,
they
die
,
and
no
angel
be
see
hold
forth
the
crown
and
the
palm
branch
.
<EOS>
then
it
be
that
the
submission
of
the
soul
to
the
high
be
test
,
and
even
in
the
eye
of
frivolity
life
look
out
from
the
scene
of
human
struggle
with
the
awful
face
of
duty
,
and
a
religion
show
itself
which
be
something
else
than
a
private
consolation
.
  
<EOS>
that
be
the
sort
of
crisis
which
be
at
this
moment
begin
in
Gwendolen
's
small
life
:
she
be
for
the
first
time
feel
the
pressure
of
a
vast
mysterious
movement
,
for
the
first
time
be
dislodge
from
her
supremacy
in
her
own
world
,
and
get
a
sense
that
her
horizon
be
but
a
dipping
onward
of
an
existence
with
which
her
own
be
revolving
.
<EOS>
all
the
trouble
of
her
wifehood
and
widowhood
have
still
leave
her
with
the
implicit
impression
which
have
accompany
her
from
childhood
,
that
whatever
surround
her
be
somehow
specially
for
her
,
and
it
be
because
of
this
that
no
personal
jealousy
have
be
rouse
in
her
relation
to
Deronda
:
<EOS>
she
could
not
spontaneously
think
of
him
as
rightfully
belong
to
other
more
than
to
her
.
<EOS>
but
here
have
come
a
shock
which
go
deep
than
personal
jealousy
 
<EOS>
something
spiritual
and
vaguely
tremendous
that
thrust
her
away
,
and
yet
quell
all
her
anger
into
self
-
humiliation
.
  
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
long
silence
.
<EOS>
Deronda
have
stand
still
,
even
thankful
for
an
interval
before
he
need
to
say
more
,
and
Gwendolen
have
sit
like
a
statue
with
her
wrist
lie
over
each
other
and
her
eye
fix
 
<EOS>
the
intensity
of
her
mental
action
arrest
all
other
excitation
.
<EOS>
at
length
something
occur
to
her
that
make
her
turn
her
face
to
Deronda
and
say
in
a
tremble
voice
    
"
<EOS>
be
that
all
you
can
tell
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
question
be
like
a
dart
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
the
Jew
whom
I
mention
just
now
,
"
he
answer
,
not
without
a
certain
tremor
in
his
tone
too
,
"
the
remarkable
man
who
have
greatly
influence
my
mind
,
have
not
perhaps
be
totally
unheard
of
by
you
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
brother
of
Miss
Lapidoth
,
whom
you
have
often
hear
sing
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
great
wave
of
remembrance
pass
through
Gwendolen
and
spread
as
a
deep
,
painful
flush
over
neck
and
face
.
<EOS>
It
have
come
first
at
the
scene
of
that
morning
when
she
have
call
on
Mirah
,
and
hear
Deronda
's
voice
reading
,
and
be
tell
,
without
then
heed
it
,
that
he
be
read
Hebrew
with
Mirah
's
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
very
ill
 
very
near
death
now
,
"
Deronda
go
on
,
nervously
,
and
then
stop
short
.
<EOS>
He
feel
that
he
must
wait
.
<EOS>
Would
she
divine
the
rest
?
  
<EOS>
"
do
she
tell
you
that
I
go
to
her
?
"
say
Gwendolen
,
abruptly
,
look
up
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
turn
away
her
eye
again
,
and
sit
think
.
<EOS>
slowly
the
color
dry
out
of
face
and
neck
,
and
she
be
as
pale
as
before
 
with
that
almost
withered
paleness
which
be
see
after
a
painful
flush
.
<EOS>
at
last
she
say
 
without
turn
toward
him
 
in
a
low
,
measured
voice
,
as
if
she
be
only
think
aloud
in
preparation
for
future
speech
    
<EOS>
"
but
_
can
_
you
marry
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Deronda
,
also
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
to
marry
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
first
there
be
no
change
in
Gwendolen
's
attitude
:
she
only
begin
to
tremble
visibly
;
then
she
look
before
her
with
dilate
eye
,
as
at
something
lie
in
front
of
her
,
till
she
stretch
her
arm
out
straight
,
and
cry
with
a
smothered
voice
    
<EOS>
"
I
say
I
should
be
forsake
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
a
cruel
woman
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
forsaken
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
's
anguish
be
intolerable
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
help
himself
.
<EOS>
He
seize
her
outstretched
hand
and
hold
them
together
,
and
kneel
at
her
foot
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
victim
of
his
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
cruel
,
too
,
I
be
cruel
,
"
he
repeat
,
with
a
sort
of
groan
,
look
up
at
her
imploringly
.
  
<EOS>
His
presence
and
touch
seem
to
dispel
a
horrible
vision
,
and
she
meet
his
upward
look
of
sorrow
with
something
like
the
return
of
consciousness
after
faint
.
<EOS>
then
she
dwell
on
it
with
that
grow
pathetic
movement
of
the
brow
which
accompany
the
revival
of
some
tender
recollection
.
<EOS>
the
look
of
sorrow
bring
back
what
seem
a
very
far
-
off
moment
 
<EOS>
the
first
time
she
have
ever
see
it
,
in
the
library
at
the
Abbey
.
<EOS>
Sobs
rise
,
and
great
tear
fall
fast
.
<EOS>
Deronda
would
not
let
her
hand
go
 
hold
them
still
with
one
of
his
,
and
himself
press
her
handkerchief
against
her
eye
.
<EOS>
She
submit
like
a
half
-
soothe
child
,
make
an
effort
to
speak
,
which
be
hinder
by
struggle
sobs
.
<EOS>
at
last
she
succeed
in
saying
,
brokenly
    
<EOS>
"
I
say
 
I
say
 
it
should
be
well
 
better
with
me
 
for
have
know
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
eye
too
be
large
with
tear
.
<EOS>
She
wrest
one
of
her
hand
from
his
,
and
return
his
action
,
press
his
tear
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
not
be
quite
parted
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
write
to
you
always
,
when
I
can
,
and
you
will
answer
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
wait
till
she
say
in
a
whisper
,
"
I
will
try
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
more
with
you
than
I
use
to
be
,
"
Deronda
say
with
gentle
urgency
,
release
her
hand
and
rise
from
his
kneel
posture
.
<EOS>
"
if
we
have
be
much
together
before
,
we
should
have
feel
our
difference
more
,
and
seem
to
get
farther
apart
.
<EOS>
now
we
can
perhaps
never
see
each
other
again
.
<EOS>
but
our
mind
may
get
near
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
say
nothing
,
but
rise
too
,
automatically
.
<EOS>
Her
withered
look
of
grief
,
such
as
the
sun
often
shine
on
when
the
blind
be
draw
up
after
the
burial
of
life
's
joy
,
make
him
hate
his
own
word
:
they
seem
to
have
the
hardness
of
easy
consolation
in
them
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
he
be
go
,
and
that
nothing
could
hinder
it
.
<EOS>
the
sense
of
it
be
like
a
dreadful
whisper
in
her
ear
,
which
dull
all
other
consciousness
;
and
she
have
not
know
that
she
be
rise
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
could
not
speak
again
.
<EOS>
He
think
that
they
must
part
in
silence
,
but
it
be
difficult
to
move
toward
the
parting
,
till
she
look
at
him
with
a
sort
of
intention
in
her
eye
,
which
help
him
.
<EOS>
He
advance
to
put
out
his
hand
silently
,
and
when
she
have
place
her
within
it
,
she
say
what
her
mind

through

<EOS>
in
the
checkered
area
of
human
experience
the
season
be
all
mingle
    
as
in
the
golden
age
:
<EOS>
fruit
and
blossom
hang
together
;
in
the
same
    
moment
the
sickle
be
reap
and
the
seed
be
sprinkle
;
one
tend
the
    
green
cluster
and
another
tread
the
winepress
.
<EOS>
nay
,
in
each
of
our
    
live
harvest
and
spring
-
time
be
continually
one
,
until
himself
    
gather
us
and
sow
us
anew
in
his
invisible
field
.
   
<EOS>
among
the
blessing
of
love
there
be
hardly
one
more
exquisite
than
the
sense
that
in
unite
the
beloved
life
to
ours
we
can
watch
over
its
happiness
,
bring
comfort
where
hardship
be
,
and
over
memory
of
privation
and
suffer
open
the
sweetest
fountain
of
joy
.
<EOS>
Deronda
's
love
for
Mirah
be
strongly
imbued
with
that
bless
protectiveness
.
<EOS>
even
with
infantine
foot
she
have
begin
to
tread
among
thorn
;
and
the
first
time
he
have
behold
her
face
it
have
seem
to
him
the
girlish
image
of
despair
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
she
be
glow
like
a
dark
-
tipped
yet
delicate
ivory
-
tint
flower
in
the
warm
sunlight
of
content
,
think
of
any
possible
grief
as
part
of
that
life
with
Deronda
,
which
she
could
call
by
no
other
name
than
good
.
<EOS>
and
he
watch
the
sober
gladness
which
give
new
beauty
to
her
movement
;
and
her
habitual
attitude
of
repose
,
with
a
delight
which
make
him
say
to
himself
that
it
be
enough
of
personal
joy
for
him
to
save
her
from
pain
.
<EOS>
She
know
nothing
of
Hans
's
struggle
or
of
Gwendolen
's
pang
;
for
after
the
assurance
that
Deronda
's
hide
love
have
be
for
her
,
she
easily
explain
Gwendolen
's
eager
solicitude
about
him
as
part
of
a
grateful
dependence
on
his
goodness
,
such
as
she
herself
have
know
.
<EOS>
and
all
Deronda
's
word
about
Mrs.
Grandcourt
confirm
that
view
of
their
relation
,
though
he
never
touch
on
it
except
in
the
most
distant
manner
.
<EOS>
Mirah
be
ready
to
believe
that
he
have
be
a
rescue
angel
to
many
besides
herself
.
<EOS>
the
only
wonder
be
,
that
she
among
them
all
be
to
have
the
bliss
of
be
continually
by
his
side
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
when
the
bridal
veil
be
around
Mirah
it
hide
no
doubtful
tremor
 
<EOS>
only
a
thrill
of
awe
at
the
acceptance
of
a
great
gift
which
require
great
use
.
<EOS>
and
the
velvet
canopy
never
cover
a
more
goodly
bride
and
bridegroom
,
to
whom
their
people
may
more
wisely
wish
offspring
;
more
truthful
lip
never
touch
the
sacrament
marriage

wine
;
the
marriage

blessing
never
gather
strong
promise
of
fulfillment
than
in
the
integrity
of
their
mutual
pledge
.
<EOS>
naturally
,
they
be
marry
accord
to
the
jewish
rite
.
<EOS>
and
since
no
religion
seem
yet
to
have
demand
that
when
we
make
a
feast
we
should
invite
only
the
high
rank
of
our

,
few
,
it
be
to

the
entire
Cohen

,
with
the
one
exception
of
the

<EOS>
how
could
Mordecai
have
bear
that
those
friend
of
his
adversity
should
have
be
shut
out
from

in

<EOS>
Mrs.

fully
understand
this
that
she
have
quite
reconcile
herself
to
meet
the
jewish
pawnbroker
,
and
be

all
of

enjoy
the
consciousness
that
Mirah
's
marriage
to
Deronda
crown
a
romance
which
would
always
make
a
sweet
memory
to
them

<EOS>
for
which
of

have
not
have
a
generous
part
in
it
 
give
their

<EOS>
if

it
would
have
be
well
;
but
Mab
have
already
observe
that
man

so
inconvenient
;
suppose
she
,
Kate
,
and
Amy
have
all
fall
in
love
with
Mr.
Deronda
?
 
<EOS>
but
be

<EOS>
the

reward
for

Jacob

and
contribute
several
small
whinnying
laugh
as
a
free
accompaniment
of
his

not
irreverently

but
from
a
lively

while
Adelaide

Mordecai

GWENDOLEN

.
  
<EOS>
the
preparation
for
the
departure
of
all
three
to
the
East
begin
at
once
;
for
Deronda
could
not
deny
Ezra
's
wish
that
they
should
set
out
on
the
voyage
forthwith
,
so
that
he
may
go
with
them
,
instead
of
detain
them
to
watch
over
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
belief
that
Ezra
's
life
would
last
through
the
voyage
,
<EOS>
for
there
be
symptom
which
seem
to
show
that
the
last
stage
of
his
malady
have
set
in
.
<EOS>
but
Ezra
himself
have
say
,
"
never
mind
where
I
die
,
so
that
I
be
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
set
out
with
them
.
<EOS>
one
morning
early
he
say
to
Deronda
,
"
do
not
quit
me
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
shall
die
before
it
be
end
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
choose
to
be
dress
and
sit
up
in
his
easy
chair
as
usual
,
Deronda
and
Mirah
on
each
side
of
him
,
and
for
some
hour
he
be
unusually
silent
,
not
even
make
the
effort
to
speak
,
but
look
at
them
occasionally
with
eye
full
of
some
restful
meaning
,
as
if
to
assure
them
that
while
this
remnant
of
breathing
-
time
be
difficult
,
he
feel
an
ocean
of
peace
beneath
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
till
late
in
the
afternoon
,
when
the
light
be
fall
,
that
he
take
a
hand
of
each
in
his
and
say
,
look
at
Deronda
,
"
death
be
come
to
me
as
the
divine
kiss
which
be
both
parting
and
reunion
 
which
take
me
from
your
bodily
eye
and
give
me
full
presence
in
your
soul
.
<EOS>
where
thou
goest
,
Daniel
,
I
shall
go
.
<EOS>
be
it
not
begin
?
<EOS>
have
I
not
breathe
my
soul
into
you
?
<EOS>
We
shall
live
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
pause
,
and
Deronda
wait
,
think
that
there
may
be
another
word
for
him
.
<EOS>
but
slowly
and
with
effort
Ezra
,
press
on
their
hand
,
raise
himself
and
utter
in
Hebrew
the
confession
of
the
divine
Unity
,
which
long
for
generation
have
be
on
the
lip
of
the
die
Israelite
.
  
<EOS>
He
sink
back
gently
into
his
chair
,
and
do
not
speak
again
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
some
hour
before
he
have
cease
to
breathe
,
with
Mirah
's
and
Deronda
's
arm
around
him
.
    
<EOS>
"
nothing
be
here
for
tear
,
nothing
to
wail
  
or
knock
the
breast
;
no
weakness
,
no
contempt
,
  
dispraise
or
blame
;
nothing
but
well
and
fair

and
what
may
quiet
us
in
a

so
noble
