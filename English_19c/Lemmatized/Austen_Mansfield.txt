   
about
thirty
year
ago
Miss
Maria
Ward
,
of
Huntingdon
,
with
only
seven
thousand
pound
,
have
the
good
luck
to
captivate
Sir
Thomas
Bertram
,
of
Mansfield
Park
,
in
the
county
of
Northampton
,
and
to
be
thereby
raise
to
the
rank
of
a
baronet
's
lady
,
with
all
the
comfort
and
consequence
of
an
handsome
house
and
large
income
.
<EOS>
all
Huntingdon
exclaim
on
the
greatness
of
the
match
,
and
her
uncle
,
the
lawyer
,
himself
,
allow
her
to
be
at
least
three
thousand
pound
short
of
any
equitable
claim
to
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
two
sister
to
be
benefit
by
her
elevation
;
and
such
of
their
acquaintance
as
think
Miss
Ward
and
Miss
Frances
quite
as
handsome
as
Miss
Maria
,
do
not
scruple
to
predict
their
marrying
with
almost
equal
advantage
.
<EOS>
but
there
certainly
be
not
so
many
man
of
large
fortune
in
the
world
as
there
be
pretty
woman
to
deserve
them
.
<EOS>
Miss
Ward
,
at
the
end
of
half
a
dozen
year
,
find
herself
oblige
to
be
attach
to
the
Rev.
Mr.
Norris
,
a
friend
of
her
brother
-
in
-
law
,
with
scarcely
any
private
fortune
,
and
Miss
Frances
fare
yet
bad
.
<EOS>
Miss
Ward
's
match
,
indeed
,
when
it
come
to
the
point
,
be
not
contemptible
:
Sir
Thomas
be
happily
able
to
give
his
friend
an
income
in
the
living
of
Mansfield
;
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Norris
begin
their
career
of
conjugal
felicity
with
very
little
less
than
a
thousand
a
year
.
<EOS>
but
Miss
Frances
marry
,
in
the
common
phrase
,
to
disoblige
her
family
,
and
by
fix
on
a
lieutenant
of
marines
,
without
education
,
fortune
,
or
connexion
,
do
it
very
thoroughly
.
<EOS>
She
could
hardly
have
make
a
more
untoward
choice
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Bertram
have
interest
,
which
,
from
principle
as
well
as
pride
 
from
a
general
wish
of
do
right
,
and
a
desire
of
see
all
that
be
connect
with
him
in
situation
of
respectability
,
he
would
have
be
glad
to
exert
for
the
advantage
of
Lady
Bertram
's
sister
;
but
her
husband
's
profession
be
such
as
no
interest
could
reach
;
and
before
he
have
time
to
devise
any
other
method
of
assist
them
,
an
absolute
breach
between
the
sister
have
take
place
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
natural
result
of
the
conduct
of
each
party
,
and
such
as
a
very
imprudent
marriage
almost
always
produce
.
<EOS>
to
save
herself
from
useless
remonstrance
,
Mrs.
Price
never
write
to
her
family
on
the
subject
till
actually
married
.
<EOS>
Lady
Bertram
,
who
be
a
woman
of
very
tranquil
feeling
,
and
a
temper
remarkably
easy
and
indolent
,
would
have
content
herself
with
merely
give
up
her
sister
,
and
think
no
more
of
the
matter
;
but
Mrs.
Norris
have
a
spirit
of
activity
,
which
could
not
be
satisfied
till
she
have
write
a
long
and
angry
letter
to
Fanny
,
to
point
out
the
folly
of
her
conduct
,
and
threaten
her
with
all
its
possible
ill
consequence
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Price
,
in
her
turn
,
be
injure
and
angry
;
and
an
answer
,
which
comprehend
each
sister
in
its
bitterness
,
and
bestow
such
very
disrespectful
reflection
on
the
pride
of
Sir
Thomas
as
Mrs.
Norris
could
not
possibly
keep
to
herself
,
put
an
end
to
all
intercourse
between
them
for
a
considerable
period
.
  
<EOS>
Their
home
be
so
distant
,
and
the
circle
in
which
they
move
so
distinct
,
as
almost
to
preclude
the
mean
of
ever
hearing
of
each
other
's
existence
during
the
eleven
follow
year
,
or
,
at
least
,
to
make
it
very
wonderful
to
Sir
Thomas
that
Mrs.
Norris
should
ever
have
it
in
her
power
to
tell
them
,
as
she
now
and
then
do
,
in
an
angry
voice
,
that
Fanny
have
get
another
child
.
<EOS>
by
the
end
of
eleven
year
,
however
,
Mrs.
Price
could
no
longer
afford
to
cherish
pride
or
resentment
,
or
to
lose
one
connexion
that
may
possibly
assist
her
.
<EOS>
a
large
and
still
increase
family
,
an
husband
disable
for
active
service
,
but
not
the
less
equal
to
company
and
good
liquor
,
and
a
very
small
income
to
supply
their
want
,
make
her
eager
to
regain
the
friend
she
have
so
carelessly
sacrifice
;
and
she
address
Lady
Bertram
in
a
letter
which
speak
so
much
contrition
and
despondence
,
such
a
superfluity
of
child
,
and
such
a
want
of
almost
everything
else
,
as
could
not
but
dispose
them
all
to
a
reconciliation
.
<EOS>
She
be
prepare
for
her
ninth
lying
-
in
;
and
after
bewail
the
circumstance
,
and
implore
their
countenance
as
sponsor
to
the
expect
child
,
she
could
not
conceal
how
important
she
feel
they
may
be
to
the
future
maintenance
of
the
eight
already
in
be
.
<EOS>
Her
eldest
be
a
boy
of
ten
year
old
,
a
fine
spirit
fellow
,
who
long
to
be
out
in
the
world
;
but
what
could
she
do
?
<EOS>
be
there
any
chance
of
his
be
hereafter
useful
to
Sir
Thomas
in
the
concern
of
his
west
indian
property
?
<EOS>
no
situation
would
be
beneath
him
;
or
what
do
Sir
Thomas
think
of
Woolwich
?
<EOS>
or
how
could
a
boy
be
send
out
to
the
East
?
  
<EOS>
the
letter
be
not
unproductive
.
<EOS>
It
re
-
establish
peace
and
kindness
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
send
friendly
advice
and
profession
,
Lady
Bertram
dispatch
money
and
baby
-
linen
,
and
Mrs.
Norris
write
the
letter
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
its
immediate
effect
,
and
within
a
twelvemonth
a
more
important
advantage
to
Mrs.
Price
result
from
it
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
be
often
observe
to
the
other
that
she
could
not
get
her
poor
sister
and
her
family
out
of
her
head
,
and
that
,
much
as
they
have
all
do
for
her
,
she
seem
to
be
want
to
do
more
;
and
at
length
she
could
not
but
own
it
to
be
her
wish
that
poor
Mrs.
Price
should
be
relieve
from
the
charge
and
expense
of
one
child
entirely
out
of
her
great
number
.
<EOS>
"
what
if
they
be
among
them
to
undertake
the
care
of
her
eld
daughter
,
a
girl
now
nine
year
old
,
of
an
age
to
require
more
attention
than
her
poor
mother
could
possibly
give
?
<EOS>
the
trouble
and
expense
of
it
to
them
would
be
nothing
,
compare
with
the
benevolence
of
the
action
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Bertram
agree
with
her
instantly
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
we
can
not
do
better
,
"
say
she
;
"
let
us
send
for
the
child
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
could
not
give
so
instantaneous
and
unqualifie
a
consent
.
<EOS>
He
debate
and
hesitate
;
 
it
be
a
serious
charge
;
 
a
girl
so
bring
up
must
be
adequately
provide
for
,
or
there
would
be
cruelty
instead
of
kindness
in
take
her
from
her
family
.
<EOS>
He
think
of
his
own
four
child
,
of
his
two
son
,
of
cousin
in
love
,
etc
.
<EOS>
;
 
<EOS>
but
no
sooner
have
he
deliberately
begin
to
state
his
objection
,
than
Mrs.
Norris
interrupt
him
with
a
reply
to
them
all
,
whether
state
or
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Sir
Thomas
,
I
perfectly
comprehend
you
,
and
do
justice
to
the
generosity
and
delicacy
of
your
notion
,
which
indeed
be
quite
of
a
piece
with
your
general
conduct
;
and
I
entirely
agree
with
you
in
the
main
as
to
the
propriety
of
do
everything
one
could
by
way
of
provide
for
a
child
one
have
in
a
manner
take
into
one
's
own
hand
;
and
I
be
sure
I
should
be
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
withhold
my
mite
upon
such
an
occasion
.
<EOS>
have
no
child
of
my
own
,
who
should
I
look
to
in
any
little
matter
I
may
ever
have
to
bestow
,
but
the
child
of
my
sister
?
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
sure
Mr.
Norris
be
too
just
 
<EOS>
but
you
know
I
be
a
woman
of
few
word
and
profession
.
<EOS>
do
not
let
us
be
frighten
from
a
good
deed
by
a
trifle
.
<EOS>
give
a
girl
an
education
,
and
introduce
her
properly
into
the
world
,
and
ten
to
one
<EOS>
but
she
have
the
mean
of
settle
well
,
without
farth
expense
to
anybody
.
<EOS>
a
niece
of
our
,
Sir
Thomas
,
I
may
say
,
or
at
least
of
_
yours
_
,
would
not
grow
up
in
this
neighbourhood
without
many
advantage
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
she
would
be
so
handsome
as
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
she
would
not
;
but
she
would
be
introduce
into
the
society
of
this
country
under
such
very
favourable
circumstance
as
,
in
all
human
probability
,
would
get
her
a
creditable
establishment
.
<EOS>
You
be
think
of
your
son
 
but
do
not
you
know
that
,
of
all
thing
upon
earth
,
_
that
_
be
the
least
likely
to
happen
,
bring
up
as
they
would
be
,
always
together
like
brother
and
sister
?
<EOS>
It
be
morally
impossible
.
<EOS>
I
never
know
an
instance
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
in
fact
,
the
only
sure
way
of
provide
against
the
connexion
.
<EOS>
suppose
her
a
pretty
girl
,
and
see
by
Tom
or
Edmund
for
the
first
time
seven
year
hence
,
and
I
dare
say
there
would
be
mischief
.
<EOS>
the
very
idea
of
her
have
be
suffer
to
grow
up
at
a
distance
from
us
all
in
poverty
and
neglect
,
would
be
enough
to
make
either
of
the
dear
,
sweet
-
tempered
boy
in
love
with
her
.
<EOS>
but
breed
her
up
with
them
from
this
time
,
and
suppose
her
even
to
have
the
beauty
of
an
angel
,
and
she
will
never
be
more
to
either
than
a
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
great
deal
of
truth
in
what
you
say
,
"
reply
Sir
Thomas
,
"
and
far
be
it
from
me
to
throw
any
fanciful
impediment
in
the
way
of
a
plan
which
would
be
so
consistent
with
the
relative
situation
of
each
.
<EOS>
I
only
mean
to
observe
that
it
ought
not
to
be
lightly
engage
in
,
and
that
to
make
it
really
serviceable
to
Mrs.
Price
,
and
creditable
to
ourselves
,
we
must
secure
to
the
child
,
or
consider
ourselves
engage
to
secure
to
her
hereafter
,
as
circumstance
may
arise
,
the
provision
of
a
gentlewoman
,
if
no
such
establishment
should
offer
as
you
be
so
sanguine
in
expecting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thoroughly
understand
you
,
"
cry
Mrs.
Norris
,
"
you
be
everything
that
be
generous
and
considerate
,
and
I
be
sure
we
shall
never
disagree
on
this
point
.
<EOS>
whatever
I
can
do
,
as
you
well
know
,
I
be
always
ready
enough
to
do
for
the
good
of
those
I
love
;
and
,
though
I
could
never
feel
for
this
little
girl
the
hundredth
part
of
the
regard
<EOS>
I
bear
your
own
dear
child
,
nor
consider
her
,
in
any
respect
,
so
much
my
own
,
I
should
hate
myself
if
I
be
capable
of
neglect
her
.
<EOS>
be
not
she
a
sister
's
child
?
<EOS>
and
could
I
bear
to
see
her
want
while
I
have
a
bit
of
bread
to
give
her
?
<EOS>
My
dear
Sir
Thomas
,
with
all
my
fault
I
have
a
warm
heart
;
and
,
poor
as
I
be
,
would
rather
deny
myself
the
necessary
of
life
than
do
an
ungenerous
thing
.
<EOS>
so
,
if
you
be
not
against
it
,
I
will
write
to
my
poor
sister
tomorrow
,
and
make
the
proposal
;
and
,
as
soon
as
matter
be
settle
,
_
<EOS>
I
_
will
engage
to
get
the
child
to
Mansfield
;
_
you
_
shall
have
no
trouble
about
it
.
<EOS>
My
own
trouble
,
you
know
,
I
never
regard
.
<EOS>
I
will
send
Nanny
to
London
on
purpose
,
and
she
may
have
a
bed
at
her
cousin
the
saddler
's
,
and
the
child
be
appoint
to
meet
her
there
.
<EOS>
They
may
easily
get
her
from
Portsmouth
to
town
by
the
coach
,
under
the
care
of
any
creditable
person
that
may
chance
to
be
go
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
there
be
always
some
reputable
tradesman
's
wife
or
other
go
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
except
to
the
attack
on
Nanny
's
cousin
,
Sir
Thomas
no
longer
make
any
objection
,
and
a
more
respectable
,
though
less
economical
rendezvous
being
accordingly
substitute
,
everything
be
consider
as
settle
,
and
the
pleasure
of
so
benevolent
a
scheme
be
already
enjoy
.
<EOS>
the
division
of
gratify
sensation
ought
not
,
in
strict
justice
,
to
have
be
equal
;
for
Sir
Thomas
be
fully
resolve
to
be
the
real
and
consistent
patron
of
the
select
child
,
and
Mrs.
Norris
have
not
the
least
intention
of
be
at
any
expense
whatever
in
her
maintenance
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
walk
,
talk
,
and
contrive
reach
,
she
be
thoroughly
benevolent
,
and
nobody
know
better
how
to
dictate
liberality
to
other
;
but
her
love
of
money
be
equal
to
her
love
of
direct
,
and
she
know
quite
as
well
how
to
save
her
own
as
to
spend
that
of
her
friend
.
<EOS>
have
marry
on
a
narrow
income
than
she
have
be
use
to
look
forward
to
,
she
have
,
from
the
first
,
fancy
a
very
strict
line
of
economy
necessary
;
and
what
be
begin
as
a
matter
of
prudence
,
soon
grow
into
a
matter
of
choice
,
as
an
object
of
that
needful
solicitude
which
there
be
no
child
to
supply
.
<EOS>
have
there
be
a
family
to
provide
for
<EOS>
,
Mrs.
Norris
may
never
have
save
her
money
;
but
have
no
care
of
that
kind
,
there
be
nothing
to
impede
her
frugality
,
or
lessen
the
comfort
of
make
a
yearly
addition
to
an
income
which
they
have
never
live
up
to
.
<EOS>
under
this
infatuate
principle
,
counteract
by
no
real
affection
for
her
sister
,
it
be
impossible
for
her
to
aim
at
more
than
the
credit
of
projecting
and
arranging
so
expensive
a
charity
;
though
perhaps
she
may
so
little
know
herself
as
to
walk
home
to
the
Parsonage
,
after
this
conversation
,
in
the
happy
belief
of
be
the
most
liberal
-
minded
sister
and
aunt
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
subject
be
bring
forward
again
,
her
view
be
more
fully
explain
;
and
,
in
reply
to
Lady
Bertram
's
calm
inquiry
of
"
where
shall
the
child
come
to
first
,
sister
,
to
you
or
to
us
?
"
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
hear
with
some
surprise
that
it
would
be
totally
out
of
Mrs.
Norris
's
power
to
take
any
share
in
the
personal
charge
of
her
.
<EOS>
He
have

consider
her
as
a
particularly
welcome
addition
at
the
Parsonage

as
a
desirable
companion
to
an
aunt
who

no
child
of
her
own

he
find
himself
wholly
mistaken

<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
be
sorry
to
say
that
the
little
girl
's
stay
with
them
,
at
least
as
thing
then
be
,
be
quite
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
poor
Mr.
Norris
's
indifferent
state
of
health
make
it
an
impossibility
:
he
could
no
more
bear
the
noise
of
a
child
than
he
could
fly
;
if
,
indeed
,
he
should
ever
get
well
of
his
gouty
complaint
<EOS>
,
it
would
be
a
different
matter
:
she
should
then
be
glad
to
take
her
turn
,
and
think
nothing
of
the
inconvenience
;
but
just
now
,
poor
Mr.
Norris
take
up
every
moment
of
her
time
,
and
the
very
mention
of
such
a
thing
she
be
sure
would
distract
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
she
have
better
come
to
us
,
"
say
Lady
Bertram
,
with
the
utmost
composure
.
<EOS>
after
a
short
pause
Sir
Thomas
add
with
dignity
,
"
yes
,
let
her
home
be
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
We
will
endeavour
to
do
our
duty
by
her
,
and
she
will
,
at
least
,
have
the
advantage
of
companion
of
her
own
age
,
and
of
a
regular
instructress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
true
,
"
cry
Mrs.
Norris
,
"
which
be
both
very
important
consideration
;
and
it
will
be
just
the
same
to
Miss
Lee
whether
she
have
three
girl
to
teach
,
or
only
two
 
there
can
be
no
difference
.
<EOS>
I
only
wish
I
could
be
more
useful
;
but
you
see
I
do
all
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
one
of
those
that
spare
their
own
trouble
;
and
Nanny
shall
fetch
her
,
however
it
may
put
me
to
inconvenience
to
have
my
chief
counsellor
away
for
three
day
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
sister
,
you
will
put
the
child
in
the
little
white
attic
,
near
the
old
nursery
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
much
the
good
place
for
her
,
so
near
Miss
Lee
,
and
not
far
from
the
girl
,
and
close
by
the
housemaid
,
who
could
either
of
them
help
to
dress
her
,
you
know
,
and
take
care
of
her
clothe
,
for
I
suppose
you
would
not
think
it
fair
to
expect
Ellis
to
wait
on
her
as
well
as
the
other
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
do
not
see
that
you
could
possibly
place
her
anywhere
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Bertram
make
no
opposition
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
will
prove
a
well
-
dispose
girl
,
"
continue
Mrs.
Norris
,
"
and
be
sensible
of
her
uncommon
good
fortune
in
have
such
friend

<EOS>
"
  
"
Should
her
disposition
be
really
bad
,
"
say
Sir
Thomas
,
"
we
must
not
,
for
our
own
child
's
sake
,
continue
her
in
the
family
;
but
there
be
no
reason
to
expect
so
great
an
evil
.
<EOS>
We
shall
probably
see
much
to
wish
alter
in
her
,
and
must
prepare
ourselves
for
gross
ignorance
,
some
meanness
of
opinion
,
and
very
distressing
vulgarity
of
manner
;
but
these
be
not
incurable
fault
;
nor
,
I
trust
,
can
they
be
dangerous
for
her
associate
.
<EOS>
have
my
daughter
be
_
young
_
than
herself
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
consider
the
introduction
of
such
a
companion
as
a
matter
of
very
serious
moment
;
but
,
as
it
be
,
I
hope
there
can
be
nothing
to
fear
for
_
them

and
everything
to
hope
for
_
her
_
,
from
the
association

<EOS>

that
be
exactly
what
I
think

cry
Mrs.
Norris
,
"
and
what
I
be
say
to
my
husband
this
morning
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
an
education
for
the
child
,
say
I
,
only
be
with
her
cousin
;
if
Miss
Lee
teach
her
nothing
,
she
would
learn
to
be
good
and
clever
from
_
them

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
will
not
tease
my
poor
pug
,
"
say
Lady
Bertram
;
<EOS>
"
I
have
but
just
get
Julia
to
leave
it
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
will
be
some
difficulty
in
our
way
,
Mrs.
Norris
,
"
observe
Sir
Thomas
,
"
as
to
the
distinction
proper
to
be
make
between
the
girl
as
they
grow
up
:
how
to
preserve
in
the
mind
of
my
_
daughter
_
<EOS>
the
consciousness
of
what
they
be
,
without
make
them
think
too
lowly
of
their
cousin
;
and
how
,
without
depress
her
spirit
too
far
,
to
make
her
remember
that
she
be
not
a
_
Miss
Bertram
_
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
I
should
wish
to
see
them
very
good
friend
,
and
would
,
on
no
account
,
authorise
in
my
girl
the
small
degree
of
arrogance
towards
their
relation
;
but
still
they
can
not
be
equal
.
<EOS>
Their
rank
,
fortune
,
right
,
and
expectation
will
always
be
different
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
point
of
great
delicacy
,
and
you
must
assist
us
in
our
endeavour
to
choose
exactly
the
right
line
of
conduct
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
be
quite
at
his
service
;
and
though
she
perfectly
agree
with
him
as
to
its
be
a
most
difficult
thing
,
encourage
him
to
hope
that
between
them
it
would
be
easily
manage
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
be
readily
believe
that
Mrs.
Norris
do
not
write
to
her
sister
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Price
seem
rather
surprised
that
a
girl
should
be
fix
on
,
when
she
have
so
many
fine
boy
,
but
accept
the
offer
most
thankfully
,
assure
them
of
her
daughter

be
a
very
well

dispose
,
good

humoured
girl
,
and
trust
they
would
never
have
cause
to
throw
her
off
.
<EOS>
She
speak
of
her
farther
as
somewhat
delicate
and
puny
,
but
be
sanguine
in
the
hope
of
her
be
materially
well
for
change
of
air
.
<EOS>
poor
woman
!
<EOS>
she
probably
think
change
of
air
may
agree
with
many
of
her
child
.
    
<EOS>
the
little
girl
perform
her
long
journey
in
safety
;
and
at
Northampton
be
meet
by
Mrs.
Norris
,
who
thus
regale
in
the
credit
of
be
foremost
to
welcome
her
,
and
in
the
importance
of
lead
her
in
to
the
other

and
recommend
her
to
their
kindness
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
Price
be
at
this
time
just
ten
year
old
,
and
though
there
may
not
be
much
in
her
first
appearance
to
captivate
,
there
be
,
at
least
,
nothing
to
disgust
her
relation
.
<EOS>
She
be
small
of
her
age
,
with
no
glow
of
complexion
,
nor
any
other
striking
beauty
;
exceedingly
timid
and
shy
,
and
shrink
from
notice
;
but
her
air
,
though
awkward
,
be
not
vulgar
,
her
voice
be
sweet
,
and
when
she
speak
her
countenance
be
pretty

<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
and
Lady
Bertram
receive
her
very
kindly
;
and
Sir
Thomas
,
see
how
much
she
need
encouragement
,
try
to
be
all
that
be
conciliate
:
but
he
have
to
work
against
a
most
untoward
gravity
of
deportment
;
and
Lady
Bertram
,
without
take
half
so
much
trouble
,
or
speak
one
word
where
he
speak
ten
,
by
the
mere
aid
of
a
good
-
humoured
smile

become
immediately
the
less
awful
character
of
the
two

<EOS>
the
young
people
be
all
at
home
,
and
sustain
their
share
in
the
introduction
very
well
,
with
much
good
humour
,
and
no
embarrassment
,
at
least
on
the
part
of
the
son
,
who
,
at
seventeen
and
sixteen
,
and
tall
of
their
age
,
have
all
the
grandeur
of
man
in
the
eye
of
their
little
cousin
.
<EOS>
the
two
girl
be
more
at
a
loss
from
be
young
and
in
great
awe
of
their
father
,
who
address
them
on
the
occasion
with
rather
an
injudicious
particularity
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
too
much
use
to
company
and
praise
to
have
anything
like
natural
shyness
;
and
their
confidence
increase
from
their
cousin
's
total
want
of
it
,
they
be
soon
able
to
take
a
full
survey
of
her
face
and
her
frock
in
easy
indifference
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
a
remarkably
fine
family
,
the
son
very
well
-
look
,
the
daughter
decidedly
handsome
,
and
all
of
them
well
-
grow
and
forward
of
their
age
,
which
produce
as
strike
a
difference
between
the
cousin
in
person
,
as
education
have
give
to
their
address
;
and
no
one
would
have
suppose
the
girl
so
nearly
of
an
age
as
they
really
be
.
<EOS>
there
be
in
fact
but
two
year
between
the
young
and
Fanny
.
<EOS>
Julia
Bertram
be
only
twelve
,
and
Maria
but
a
year
old
.
<EOS>
the
little
visitor
meanwhile
be
as
unhappy
as
possible
.
<EOS>
afraid
of
everybody
,
ashamed
of
herself
,
and
longing
for
the
home
she
have
leave
,
she
know
not
how
to
look
up
,
and
could
scarcely
speak
to
be
hear
,
or
without
cry
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
have
be
talk
to
her
the
whole
way
from
Northampton
of
her
wonderful
good
fortune
,
and
the
extraordinary
degree
of
gratitude
and
good
behaviour
which
it
ought
to
produce
,
and
her
consciousness
of
misery
be
therefore
increase
by
the
idea
of
its
be
a
wicked
thing
for
her
not
to
be
happy
.
<EOS>
the
fatigue
,
too
,
of
so
long
a
journey
,
become
soon
no
trifling
evil
.
<EOS>
in
vain
be
the
well
-
mean
condescension
of
Sir
Thomas
,
and
all
the
officious
prognostication
of
Mrs.
Norris
that
she
would
be
a
good
girl
;
in
vain
do
Lady
Bertram
smile
and
make
her
sit
on
the
sofa
with
herself
and
pug
,
and
vain
be
even
the
sight
of
a
gooseberry
tart
towards
give

scarcely
swallow
two
mouthful

tear
interrupt
her

sleep
seem

"
this

<EOS>
after
all
that
I
say
to
her
as
we

along

I

she
would
have
behave
better

I
tell
her
how
much
may
depend
upon
her
acquitting
herself
well
at
first

I

there
may
not

a
little
sulkiness

temper
 
<EOS>
her
poor

a
good

make
allowance
for
such

I
do
not

her

,
<EOS>
with
all
its

it

_
her
home

and
she
can
not

how

she
have
change
for
the
well

then
there
be
moderation
in
all
thing

<EOS>
It
require
a
long
time
,
however
,
than
Mrs.
Norris
be
incline
to
allow
,
to
reconcile
Fanny
to
the
novelty
of
Mansfield
Park

the
separation

use

Her

acute

<EOS>
nobody

be
unkind

afford
leisure

little

They
could
not

hold
her
cheap
on
find
that
she

two

never

when
they

her
to

little
strike
with
the
duet
they
be
so
good
as
to
play
<EOS>

they
could
do
no

than
make
her
a
generous
present
of
some
of

toy

leave
her
to
herself

they

let
us
walk
out
in
the
park

you
shall
tell
me
all
about
your

<EOS>
on
pursue
the
subject
,
he
find
that
,
dear
as
all
these
brother
and
sister
generally
be
,
there
be
one
among
them
who
run
more
in
her
thought
than
the
rest
.
<EOS>
It
be
William
whom
she
talk
of
most
,
and
want
most
to
see
.
<EOS>
William
,
the
eld
,
a
year
old
than
herself
,
her
constant
companion
and
friend
;
her
advocate
with
her
mother
(
of
whom
he
be
the
darling
)
in
every
distress
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
William
do
not
like
she
should
come
away
;
he
have
tell
her
he
should
miss
her
very
much
indeed
.
"
<EOS>
"
but
William
will
write
to
you
,
I
dare
say
.
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
he
have
promise
he
would
,
but
he
have
tell
_
her
_
to
write
first
.
"
<EOS>
"
and
when
shall
you
do
it
?
"
<EOS>
She
hang
her
head
and
answer
hesitatingly
,
"
she
do
not
know
;
she
have
not
any
paper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
that
be
all
your
difficulty
,
I
will
furnish
you
with
paper
and
every
other
material
,
and
you
may
write
your
letter
whenever
you
choose
.
<EOS>
Would
it
make
you
happy
to
write
to
William
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
very
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
let
it
be
do
now
.
<EOS>
come
with
me
into
the
breakfast
-
room
,
we
shall
find
everything
there
,
and
be
sure
of
have
the
room
to
ourselves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
cousin
,
will
it
go
to
the
post
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
depend
upon
me
it
shall
:
it
shall
go
with
the
other
letter
;
and
,
as
your
uncle
will
frank
it
,
it
will
cost
William
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
!
"
<EOS>
repeat
Fanny
,
with
a
frightened
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
when
you
have
write
the
letter
,
I
will
take
it
to
my
father
to
frank
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
think
it
a
bold
measure
,
but
offer
no
further
resistance
;
and
they
go
together
into
the
breakfast
-
room
,
where
Edmund
prepare
her
paper
,
and
rule
her
line
with
all
the
goodwill
that
her
brother
could
himself
have
feel
,
and
probably
with
somewhat
more
exactness
.
<EOS>
He
continue
with
her
the
whole
time
of
her
writing
,
to
assist
her
with
his
penknife
or
his
orthography
,
as
either
be
want
;
and
add
to
these
attention
,
which
she
feel
very
much
,
a
kindness
to
her
brother
which
delight
her
beyond
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
He
write
with
his
own
hand
his
love
to
his
cousin
William
,
and
send
him
half
a
guinea
under
the
seal
.
<EOS>
Fanny
's
feeling
on
the
occasion
be
such
as
she
believe
herself
incapable
of
express
;
but
her
countenance
and
a
few
artless
word
fully
convey
all
their
gratitude
and
delight
,
and
her
cousin
begin
to
find
her
an
interesting
object
.
<EOS>
He
talk
to
her
more
,
and
,
from
all
that
she
say
,
be
convince
of
her
have
an
affectionate
heart
,
and
a
strong
desire
of
do
right
;
and
he
could
perceive
her
to
be
farther
entitle
to
attention
by
great
sensibility
of
her
situation
,
and
great
timidity
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
knowingly
give
her
pain
,
but
he
now
feel
that
she
require
more
positive
kindness
;
and
with
that
view
endeavour
,
in
the
first
place
,
to
lessen
her
fear
of
them
all
,
and
give
her
especially
a
great
deal
of
good
advice
as
to
play
with
Maria
and
Julia
,
and
be
as
merry
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
from
this
day
Fanny
grow
more
comfortable
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
she
have
a
friend
,
and
the
kindness
of
her
cousin
Edmund
give
her
well
spirit
with
everybody
else
.
<EOS>
the
place
become
less
strange
,
and
the
people
less
formidable
;
and
if
there
be
some
amongst
them
whom
she
could
not
cease
to
fear
,
she
begin
at
least
to
know
their
way
,
and
to
catch
the
good
manner
of
conform
to
them
.
<EOS>
the
little
rusticity
and
awkwardness
which
have
at
first
make
grievous
inroad
on
the
tranquillity
of
all
,
and
not
least
of
herself
,
necessarily
wear
away
,
and
she
be
no
longer
materially
afraid
to
appear
before
her
uncle
,
nor
do
her
aunt
Norris
's
voice
make
her
start
very
much
.
<EOS>
to
her
cousin
she
become
occasionally
an
acceptable
companion
.
<EOS>
though
unworthy
,
from
inferiority
of
age
and
strength
,
to
be
their
constant
associate
,
their
pleasure
and
scheme
be
sometimes
of
a
nature
to
make
a
third
very
useful
,
especially
when
that
third
be
of
an
obliging
,
yield
temper
;
and
they
could
not
but
own
,
when
their
aunt
inquire
into
her
fault
,
or
their
brother
Edmund
urge
her
claim
to
their
kindness
,
that
"
Fanny
be
good
-
natured
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
Edmund
be
uniformly
kind
himself
;
and
she
have
nothing
bad
to
endure
on
the
part
of
Tom
than
that
sort
of
merriment
which
a
young
man
of
seventeen
will
always
think
fair
with
a
child
of
ten
.
<EOS>
He
be
just
enter
into
life
,
full
of
spirit
,
and
with
all
the
liberal
disposition
of
an
eld
son
,
who
feel
bear
only
for
expense
and
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
His
kindness
to
his
little
cousin
be
consistent
with
his
situation
and
right
:
he
make
her
some
very
pretty
present
,
and
laugh
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
as
her
appearance
and
spirit
improve
,
Sir
Thomas
and
Mrs.
Norris
think
with
great
satisfaction
of
their
benevolent
plan
;
and
it
be
pretty
soon
decide
between
them
that
,
though
far
from
clever
,
she
show
a
tractable
disposition
,
and
seem
likely
to
give
them
little
trouble
.
<EOS>
a
mean
opinion
of
her
ability
be
not
confine
to
_
them
_
.
<EOS>
Fanny
could
read
,
work
,
and
write
,
but
she
have
be
teach
nothing
more
;
and
as
her
cousin
find
her
ignorant
of
many
thing
with
which
they
have
be
long
familiar
,
they
think
her
prodigiously
stupid
,
and
for
the
first
two
or
three
week
be
continually
bring
some
fresh
report
of
it
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
dear
mama
,
only
think
,
my
cousin
can
not
put
the
map
of
Europe
together
 
or
my
cousin
can
not
tell
the
principal
river
in
Russia

,
she
never
hear
of
Asia
Minor

<EOS>
she
do
not
know
the
difference
between
water

colour
and
crayon
!
 
<EOS>
how
strange
!
 
<EOS>
do
you
ever
hear
anything
so
stupid
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
their
considerate
aunt
would
reply
,
"
it
be
very
bad
,
but
you
must
not
expect
everybody
to
be
as
forward
and
quick
at
learn
as
yourself
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
,
aunt
,
she
be
really
so
very
ignorant
!
 
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
we
ask
her
last
night
which
way
she
would
go
to
get
to
Ireland
;
and
she
say
,
she
should
cross
to
the
Isle
of
Wight
.
<EOS>
She
think
of
nothing
but
the
Isle
of
Wight
,
and
she
call
it
_
<EOS>
the
_
_
Island
_
,
as
if
there
be
no
other
island
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
should
have
be
ashamed
of
myself
,
if
I
have
not
know
better
long
before
I
be
so
old
as
she
be
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
remember
the
time
when
I
do
not
know
a
great
deal
that
she
have
not
the
least
notion
of
yet
.
<EOS>
how
long
ago
it
be
,
aunt
,
since
we
use
to
repeat
the
chronological
order
of
the
king
of
England
,
with
the
date
of
their
accession
,
and
most
of
the
principal
event
of
their
reign

<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
add
the
other
;
"
and
of
the
roman
emperor
as
low
as
Severus
;
besides
a
great
deal
of
the
heathen
mythology
,

all
the
metal

semi

metal
,
planet
,
and
distinguished
philosopher

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
true
indeed
,
my
dear
,
but
you
be
bless
with
wonderful
memory
,
and
your
poor
cousin
have
probably
none
at
all
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
vast
deal
of
difference
in
memory
,
as
well
as
in
everything
else
,
and
therefore
you
must
make
allowance
for
your
cousin
,
and
pity
her
deficiency
.
<EOS>
and
remember
that
,
if
you
be
ever
so
forward
and
clever
yourself
,
you
should
always
be
modest
;
for
,
much
as
you
know
already
,
there
be
a
great
deal
more
for
you
to
learn
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
I
know
there
be
,
till
I
be
seventeen
.
<EOS>
but
I
must
tell
you
another
thing
of
Fanny
,
so
odd
and
so
stupid
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
she
say
she
do
not
want
to
learn
either
music
or
drawing
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
to
be
sure
,
my
dear

that
be
very
stupid
indeed
,
and
show
a
great
want
of
genius
and
emulation
.
<EOS>
but
,
all
thing
consider
,
I
do
not
know
whether
it
be
not
as
well

it
should
be
so

you
know
<EOS>

owe
to
me

<EOS>
your
papa

mama
be
so
good
as

bring
her
up
with
you
<EOS>
,
it
be
not
at
all
necessary
that
she
should
be
as
accomplished
as
you
be
;
 
on
the
contrary
,
it
be
much
more
desirable
that
there
should
be
a
difference
.

<EOS>
such
be
the
counsel
by
which
Mrs.
Norris
assist
to
form
her
niece

mind
;
and
it
be
not
very
wonderful
that
,
with
all
their
promising
talent
and
early
information

they
should
be
entirely
deficient
in
the
less
common
acquirement
of
self

knowledge

generosity

humility

in
everything
but
disposition
they
be
admirably
teach
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
do
not
know
what
be
want
,
because
,
though
a
truly
anxious
father
,
he
be
not
outwardly
affectionate
,

the
reserve
of
his
manner
repress
all
the
flow

their
spirit
before
him

<EOS>
to
the
education
of
her
daughter
Lady
Bertram
pay
not
the
small
attention

She
have
not
time
for
such

She
be
a
woman
who
spend
her
day
in
sitting

nicely
dress
,
on
a
sofa
,
do
some
long
piece
of
needlework
,
of
little
use

no
beauty

think
more
of
her

very
indulgent

the

everything
important

have
she
possess
great
leisure
for
the
service
of
her
girl

she
would
probably
have
suppose
it
unnecessary

in

much
of

there
not
unhappily

<EOS>
there
be
no

though
Fanny
be
often
mortify
by
their
treatment
of
her

she
think
too
lowly
of
her
own
claim
to
feel
injure
by
it

<EOS>
from
about
the

in
consequence
of
a
little
ill

indolence

up
the
house
in
town

which

have
be
use
to
occupy
every
spring

in
Parliament

with
whatever
increase

diminution
of
comfort
may
arise
from
her
absence

in

therefore

the
Miss
Bertrams
continue
to
exercise
their
memory
,
practise
their
duet

and
grow
tall
and
womanly
:
and
their
father
see
them
become
in
person

manner

and
accomplishment

everything
that
could
satisfy
his
anxiety

<EOS>
His

son
be
careless

extravagant

have
already
give
him
much
uneasiness

his
other

him
nothing

good

<EOS>
His
daughter

he
feel
,
while
they
retain
the
name

must
be
give
it
new
grace

in
quit
it

the

Sir

do
not
forget
to
do
what
he
could
for
the
child
of
Mrs.
Price
:
he
assist
her
liberally
in
the
education
and
disposal
of
her
son
as
they
become
old
enough
for
a
determinate
pursuit
;
and
Fanny
,
though
almost
totally
separate
from
her
family
,
be
sensible
of
the
true
satisfaction
in
hearing
of
any
kindness
towards
them
,
or
of
anything
at
all
promise
in
their
situation
or
conduct
.
<EOS>
once
,
and
once
only
,
in
the
course
of
many
year

have
she
the
happiness
of
be
with
William
.
<EOS>
of
the
rest
she
see
nothing
:
nobody
seem
to
think
of
her
ever
go
amongst
them
again
,
even
for
a
visit
,
nobody
at
home
seem
to
want
her
;
but
William
determine
,
soon
after
her
removal
,
to
be
a
sailor
,
be
invite
to
spend
a
week
with
his
sister
in
Northamptonshire
before
he
go
to
sea

Their
eager
affection
in
meeting
,
their
exquisite
delight
in
be
together
,
their
hour
of
happy
mirth
,
and
moment
of
serious
conference

may
be
imagine
;
as
well
as
the
sanguine
view
and
spirit
of
the
boy
even
to
the
last

the
misery
of
the
girl
when
he
leave
her

<EOS>
luckily
the
visit
happen
in
the
Christmas
holiday

when
she
could
directly
look
for
comfort
to
her
cousin
Edmund

tell
her
such
charming
thing
of
what
William
be
to
do
,
and
be
hereafter
,
in
consequence
of
his
profession
,
as
make
her
gradually
admit
that
the
separation
may
have
some
use
.
<EOS>
Edmund
's
friendship
never
fail
her
:
his
leave
Eton
for
Oxford
make
no
change
in
his
kind
disposition
,
and
only
afford
more
frequent
opportunity
of
prove
them
.
<EOS>
without
any
display
of
do
more
than
the
rest
,
or
any
fear
of
do
too
much
,
he
be
always
true
to
her
interest
,
and
considerate
of
her
feeling
,
try
to
make
her
good
quality
understand
,
and
to
conquer
the
diffidence
which
prevent
their
be
more
apparent
;
give
her
advice
,
consolation
,
and
encouragement
.
  
<EOS>
keep
back
as
she
be
by
everybody
else
,
his
single
support
could
not
bring
her
forward
;
but
his
attention
be
otherwise
of
the
high
importance
in
assist
the
improvement
of
her
mind
,
and
extend
its
pleasure
.
<EOS>
He
know
her
to
be
clever
,
to
have
a
quick
apprehension
as
well
as
good
sense
,
and
a
fondness
for
reading
,
which
,
properly
direct
,
must
be
an
education
in
itself
.
<EOS>
Miss
Lee
teach
her
French
,
and
hear
her
read
the
daily
portion
of
history
;
but
he
recommend
the
book
which
charm
her
leisure
hour
,
he
encourage
her
taste
,
and
correct
her
judgment
:
he
make
read
useful
by
talk
to
her
of
what
she
read
,
and
heighten
its
attraction
by
judicious
praise
.
<EOS>
in
return
for
such
service
she
love
him
better
than
anybody
in
the
world
except
William
:
her
heart
be
divide
between
the
two
.
    
<EOS>
the
first
event
of
any
importance
in
the
family
be
the
death
of
Mr.
Norris
,
which
happen
when
Fanny
be
about
fifteen
,
and
necessarily
introduce
alteration
and
novelty
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
,
on
quit
the
Parsonage
,
remove
first
to
the
Park
,
and
afterwards
to
a
small
house
of
Sir
Thomas
's
in
the
village
,
and
console
herself
for
the
loss
of
her
husband
by
consider
that
she
could
do
very
well
without
him
;
and
for
her
reduction
of
income
by
the
evident
necessity
of
strict
economy
.
  
<EOS>
the
living
be
hereafter
for
Edmund
;
and
,
have
his
uncle
die
a
few
year
sooner
,
it
would
have
be
duly
give
to
some
friend
to
hold
till
he
be
old
enough
for
order
.
<EOS>
but
Tom
's
extravagance
have
,
previous
to
that
event
,
be
so
great
as
to
render
a
different
disposal
of
the
next
presentation
necessary
,
and
the
young
brother
must
help
to
pay
for
the
pleasure
of
the
elder
.
<EOS>
there
be
another
family
live
actually
hold
for
Edmund
;
but
though
this
circumstance
have
make
the
arrangement
somewhat
easy
to
Sir
Thomas
's
conscience
,
he
could
not
but
feel
it
to
be
an
act
of
injustice
,
and
he
earnestly
try
to
impress
his
eld
son
with
the
same
conviction
,
in
the
hope
of
its
produce
a
well
effect
than
anything
he
have
yet
be
able
to
say
or
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
blush
for
you
,
Tom
,
"
say
he
,
in
his
most
dignified
manner
;
"
I
blush
for
the
expedient
which
I
be
drive
on
,
and
I
trust
I
may
pity
your
feeling
as
a
brother
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
You
have
rob
Edmund
for
ten
,
twenty
,
thirty
year
,
perhaps
for
life
,
of
more
than
half
the
income
which
ought
to
be
his
.
<EOS>
It
may
hereafter
be
in
my
power
,
or
in
yours
(
I
hope
it
will
)
,
to
procure
him
well
preferment
;
but
it
must
not
be
forget
that
no
benefit
of
that
sort
would
have
be
beyond
his
natural
claim
on
us
,
and
that
nothing
can
,
in
fact
,
be
an
equivalent
for
the
certain
advantage
which
he
be
now
oblige
to
forego
through
the
urgency
of
your
debt
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
listen
with
some
shame
and
some
sorrow
;
but
escape
as
quickly
as
possible
,
could
soon
with
cheerful
selfishness
reflect
,
firstly
,
that
he
have
not
be
half
so
much
in
debt
as
some
of
his
friend
;
secondly
,
that
his
father
have
make
a
most
tiresome
piece
of
work
of
it
;
and
,
thirdly
,
that
the
future
incumbent
,
whoever
he
may
be
,
would
,
in
all
probability
,
die
very
soon
.
  
<EOS>
on
Mr.
Norris
's
death
the
presentation
become
the
right
of
a
Dr.
Grant
,
who
come
consequently
to
reside
at
Mansfield
;
and
on
prove
to
be
a
hearty
man
of
forty
-
five
,
seem
likely
to
disappoint
Mr.
Bertram
's
calculation
.
<EOS>
but
"
no
,
he
be
a
short
-
necked
,
apoplectic
sort
of
fellow
,
and
,
ply
well
with
good
thing
,
would
soon
pop
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
a
wife
about
fifteen
year
his
junior
,
but
no
child
;
and
they
enter
the
neighbourhood
with
the
usual
fair
report
of
be
very
respectable
,
agreeable
people
.
  
<EOS>
the
time
be
now
come
when
Sir
Thomas
expect
his
sister
-
in
-
law
to
claim
her
share
in
their
niece
,
the
change
in
Mrs.
Norris
's
situation
,
and
the
improvement
in
Fanny
's
age
,
seem
not
merely
to
do
away
any
former
objection
to
their
living
together
,
but
even
to
give
it
the
most
decided
eligibility
;
and
as
his
own
circumstance
be
render
less
fair
than
heretofore
,
by
some
recent
loss
on
his
West
India
estate
,
in
addition
to
his
eld
son
's
extravagance
,
it
become
not
undesirable
to
himself
to
be
relieve
from
the
expense
of
her
support
,
and
the
obligation
of
her
future
provision
.
<EOS>
in
the
fullness
of
his
belief
that
such
a
thing
must
be
,
he
mention
its
probability
to
his
wife
;
and
the
first
time
of
the
subject
's
occurring
to
her
again
happen
to
be
when
Fanny
be
present
,
she
calmly
observe
to
her
,
"
so
,
Fanny
,
you
be
go
to
leave
us
,
and
live
with
my
sister
.
<EOS>
how
shall
you
like
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
be
too
much
surprised
to
do
more
than
repeat
her
aunt
's
word
,
"
go
to
leave
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
my

;
why
should
you
be
astonish
?
<EOS>
You
have
be
five
year
with
us
,
and
my
sister
always
mean
to
take
you
when
Mr.
Norris
die
.
<EOS>
but
you
must
come
up
and
tack
on
my
pattern
all
the
same
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
news
be
as
disagreeable
to
Fanny
as
it
have
be
unexpected
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
receive
kindness
from
her
aunt
Norris
,
and
could
not
love
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
very
sorry
to
go
away
,
"
say
she
,
with
a
falter
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
dare
say
you
will
;
_
that
be
_
natural
enough
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
have
have
as
little
to
vex
you
since
you
come
into
this
house
as
any
creature
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
be
not
ungrateful

aunt

Fanny
modestly
.
  
<EOS>
"
no

my

I
hope
not

I
have
always
find
you
a

I
never
to

here
again

never

my

you
be
sure
of
a
comfortable

<EOS>
It
can
make
very
little
difference
to
you

whether
you
be
in
one
house
or
the
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
leave
the
room
with
a
very
sorrowful
heart
;
she
could
not
feel
the
difference
to
be
so
small
,
she
could
not
think
of
live
with
her
aunt
with
anything
like
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
meet
with
Edmund
<EOS>
she
tell
him
her
distress
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cousin

"
say
she
,
"
something
be
go
to
happen
which
I
do

at
all

though
you
have
often
persuade
me
into
be
reconcile
to
thing
that
I
dislike
at
first

you
will
not

do
it

I

indeed

yes

my

Bertram
have
just
tell
me
so

It
be
quite
settle

<EOS>
I
be
to
leave
Mansfield
Park

go
to
the
White
House

I

as
soon
as
she
be
remove
there

"
  
<EOS>

well

Fanny

if
the
plan

where
she

I
be
glad
her

not

You
will
be
what
you

I

it
do
not

you
very
much

Fanny

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
it
do
:
I
can
not

it

<EOS>
I
love
this
house

everything

love
nothing

I
can

nothing

nearly
so

never

pleasant

you
be

better

you

I

my

believe
me

you
never

either

in
use
the
word
so
improperly

<EOS>
there
be
no
reason
in
the

why
you
should
not

important
where
you
be
know

<EOS>
You

why

indeed
,
Fanny

I
should
hope
to
be
remember
at
such
a
distance
as
the
White
House

<EOS>
You
speak
as
if
you
be
go
two
hundred
mile
off
instead
of
only
across
the
park

you
will
belong

us
almost
as

<EOS>
the

the

Mrs.

very
true

<EOS>
yes

dear
old
grey
pony

<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
cousin

when
I
remember
how
much
I
use

dread
riding

what
terror
it
give
me
to
hear
it
talk
of
as
likely
to
do
me
good

how
I
have
tremble
at
my
uncle

open
his
lip

horse
be
talk

and
then
think
of
the
kind
pain
you
take
to
reason
and
persuade
me
out
of
my
fear
,
and
convince
me
that
I
should
like
it
after
a
little
while
,
and
feel
how
right
you
prove
to
be
,
I
be
incline
to
hope
you
may
always
prophesy
as
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
I
be
quite
convinced
that
your
being
with
Mrs.
Norris
will
be
as
good
for
your
mind
as
riding
have
be
for
your
health
,
and
as
much
for
your
ultimate
happiness
too

"
  
<EOS>
so
end
their
discourse
,
which
,
for
any
very
appropriate
service
it
could
render
Fanny
,
may
as
well
have
be
spare
,
for
Mrs.
Norris
have
not
the
small
intention
of
take
her
.
<EOS>
It
have
never
occur
to
her
,
on
the
present
occasion
,
but
as
a
thing
to
be
carefully
avoid
.
<EOS>
to
prevent
its
be
expect
,
she
have
fix
on
the
small
habitation
which
could
rank
as
genteel
among
the
building
of
Mansfield
parish
,
the
White
House
be
only
just
large
enough
to
receive
herself
and
her
servant
,
and
allow
a
spare
room
for
a
friend

of
which
she
make
a
very
particular
point
.
<EOS>
the
spare
room
at

never

I

I

<EOS>
Lady
Bertram
repeat
enough
of
this
conversation
to
her
husband
to
convince
him
how
much
he
have
mistake
his
sister
-
in
-
law
's
view
;
and
she
be
from
that
moment
perfectly
safe
from
all
expectation
,
or
the
slight
allusion
to
it
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
but
wonder
at
her
refusing
to
do
anything
for
a
niece
whom
she
have
be
so
forward
to
adopt
;
but
,
as
she
take
early
care
to
make
him
,
as
well
as
Lady
Bertram
,
understand
that
whatever
she
possess
be
design
for
their
family

he
soon
grow
reconcile
to
a
distinction
which
,
at
the

time
that
it
be
advantageous

complimentary
to
them

would
enable
him
better
to
provide
for
Fanny
himself

Fanny
soon
learn
how
unnecessary
have
be
her
fear
of
a
removal
;
and
her
spontaneous
,
untaught
felicity
on
the
discovery
,
convey
some
consolation
to
Edmund
for
his
disappointment
in
what
he
have
expect
to
be
so
essentially
serviceable
to
her
.
<EOS>
Mrs.

a
disposition

great
satisfaction

<EOS>
They
have
their

Mrs.

them
out

<EOS>
the
Doctor
be
very
fond

would
have
a

as
high

Lady

listen
without

She
could
not

into
the

she
feel
all
the
injury
of

in

handsome

and
express
her
astonishment
on
that
point
almost
as
often
,
though
not
so
diffusely
,
as
Mrs.

discuss
the
other

these
opinion
have
be
hardly
canvass
a
year
before
another
event
arise
of
such
importance
in
the
family

as
may
fairly
claim
some
place
in
the
thought

conversation
of

Sir

find
it
expedient
to
go
to
Antigua
himself
,
for
the
well
arrangement
of
his
affair
,
and
he
take
his
eld
son
with
him
,
in
the
hope
of
detach
him
from
some
bad
connexion
at
home
.
<EOS>
They
leave
England
with
the
probability
of
be
nearly
a
twelvemonth
absent

<EOS>
the
necessity
of
the
measure
in
a
pecuniary
light
,
and
the
hope
of
its
utility
to
his
son

reconcile
Sir
Thomas
to
the
effort
of
quit
the
rest
of
his
family
,
and
of
leave
his
daughter
to
the
direction
of
other
at
their
present
most
interesting
time
of
life
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
think
Lady
Bertram
quite
equal
to
supply
his
place
with
them
,
or
rather
,
to
perform
what
should
have
be
her
own
;
but
,
in
Mrs.
Norris
's
watchful
attention
,
and
in
Edmund
's
judgment
,
he
have
sufficient
confidence
to
make
him
go
without
fear
for
their
conduct

<EOS>
Lady
Bertram
do
not
at
all
like
to

leave
her

by
any
alarm
for
his
safety

solicitude
for
his
comfort

be
one
of
those
person
who
think
nothing
can
be
dangerous

or
difficult
,
or

<EOS>
the
Miss

be
much
to
be
pity
on
the
occasion

not
for
their
sorrow

for
their
want

Their

without
aim

one
gratification

William
again
in
the
course
of
the

have
charge
her
to
write
and
invite
him
to
Mansfield
as
soon
as

belong
should
be
know
to
be
in
England

<EOS>
"
this

so
thoughtful

and
would
he
only
have
smile
upon

call
her
"

while
he
say
it
,
every
former
frown
or
cold
address
may
have
be
forget

but
he
have
end
his
speech
in
a
way
to
sink
her
in
sad
mortification
,
by
add
,
"
if
William
do
come
to
Mansfield
,
I
hope
you
may
be
able
to
convince
him
that
the
many
year

have
pass
since
you
part
have
not
be
spend
on
your
side
entirely
without
improvement

I
fear

he
must
find
his
sister
at
sixteen
in
some
respect
too
much

cry
bitterly
over
this
reflection

down

while
the

attend
such
behaviour

secure
and
bring
round
by
their
aunt
,
serve
to
strengthen
them
in
believe
they
have
no

<EOS>
Lady
Bertram
do
not
go
into
public
with
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
She
be
too
indolent
even
to
accept
a
mother
's
gratification
in
witness
their
success
and
enjoyment
at
the
expense
of
any
personal
trouble
,
and
the

who
desire
nothing
well

honourable
representation
,
and
very
thoroughly
relish
the

<EOS>
Fanny
have
no

in
the
festivity
of
the
season

but
she
enjoy
be

useful
as
her
aunt
's
companion
when
they
call
away
the
rest
of
the
family
;
and
,
as
Miss
Lee
have
leave
Mansfield
,
she
naturally
become
everything
to
Lady
Bertram
during
the
night
of
a
ball
or
a
party
.
<EOS>
She
talk
to
her
,
listen
to
her
,
read
to
her
;
and
the
tranquillity
of
such
evening
,
her
perfect
security
in
such
a
_
tete
-
a
-
tete
_
from
any
sound
of
unkindness
,
be
unspeakably
welcome
to
a
mind
which
have
seldom
know
a
pause
in
its
alarm
or
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
as
to
her
cousin

gaiety
,
she
love
to
hear
an
account
of
them
,
especially
of
the
ball
,
and
whom
Edmund
have
dance
with
;
but
think
too
lowly
of
her
own
situation
to
imagine
she
should
ever
be
admit
to
the
same
,
and
listen
,
therefore
,
without
an
idea
of
any
nearer
concern
in
them
.
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
it
be
a
comfortable
winter
to
her
;
for
though
it
bring
no
William
to
England
,
the
never
-
fail
hope
of
his
arrival
be
worth
much
.
  
<EOS>
the
ensue
spring
deprive
her
of
her
value
friend
,
the
old
grey
pony
;
and
for
some
time
she
be
in
danger
of
feel
the
loss
in
her
health
as
well
as
in
her
affection
;
for
in
spite
of
the
acknowledge
importance
of
her
ride
on
horse
-
back
,
no
measure
be
take
for
mount
her
again
,
"
because
,
"
as
it
be
observe
by
her
aunt
,
"
she
may
ride
one
of
her
cousin
's
horse
at
any
time
when
they
do
not
want
them
,
"
and
as
the
Miss
Bertrams
regularly
want
their
horse
every
fine
day
,
and
have
no
idea
of
carry
their
oblige
manner
to
the
sacrifice
of
any
real
pleasure
,
that
time
,
of
course
,
never
come
.
<EOS>
They
take
their
cheerful
ride
in
the
fine
morning
of
April
and
May
;
and
Fanny
either
sit
at
home
the
whole
day
with
one
aunt
,
or
walk
beyond
her
strength
at
the
instigation
of
the
other
:
<EOS>
Lady
Bertram
hold
exercise
to
be
as
unnecessary
for
everybody
as
it
be
unpleasant
to
herself
;
and
Mrs.
Norris
,
who
be
walk
all
day
,
<EOS>
think
everybody
ought
to
walk
as
much
.
<EOS>
Edmund
be
absent
at
this
time
,
or
the
evil
would
have
be
earlier
remedie
.
<EOS>
when
he
return
,
to
understand
how
Fanny
be
situate
,
and
perceive
its
ill
effect
,
there
seem
with
him
but
one
thing
to
be
do
;
and
that
"
Fanny
must
have
a
horse
"
be
the
resolute
declaration
with
which
he
oppose
whatever
could
be
urge
by
the
supineness
of
his
mother
,
or
the
economy
of
his
aunt
,
to
make
it
appear
unimportant
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
could
not
help
think
that
some
steady
old
thing
may
be
find
among
the
number
belong
to
the
Park
that
would
do
vastly
well
;
or
that
one
may
be
borrow
of
the
steward
;
or
that
perhaps
Dr.
Grant
may
now
and
then
lend
them
the
pony
he
send
to
the
post
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
but
consider
it
as
absolutely
unnecessary
,
and
even
improper
,
that
Fanny
should
have
a
regular
lady
's
horse
of
her
own
,
in
the
style
of
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
She
be
sure
Sir
Thomas
have
never
intend
it
:
and
she
must
say
that
,
to
be
make
such
a
purchase
in
his
absence
,
and
add
to
the
great
expense
of
his
stable
,
at
a
time
when
a
large
part
of
his
income
be
unsettle
,
seem
to
her
very
unjustifiable
.
"
<EOS>
Fanny
must
have
a
horse
,
"
be
Edmund
's
only
reply
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
could
not
see
it
in
the
same
light
.
<EOS>
Lady
Bertram
do
:
she
entirely
agree
with
her
son
as
to
the
necessity
of
it
,
and
as
to
its
being
consider
necessary
by
his
father
;
she
only
plead
against
there
be
any
hurry
;
she
only
want
him
to
wait
till
Sir
Thomas
's
return
,
and
then
Sir
Thomas
may
settle
it
all
himself
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
at
home
in
September
,
and
where
would
be
the
harm
of
only
wait
till
September
?
  
<EOS>
though
Edmund
be
much
more
displeased
with
his
aunt
than
with
his
mother
,
as
evince
least
regard
for
her
niece
,
he
could
not
help
pay
more
attention
to
what
she
say
;
and
at
length
determine
on
a
method
of
proceeding
which
would
obviate
the
risk
of
his
father
's
thinking
he
have
do
too
much
,
and
at
the
same
time
procure
for
Fanny
the
immediate
mean
of
exercise
,
which
he
could
not
bear
she
should
be
without
.
<EOS>
He
have
three
horse
of
his
own
,
but
not
one
that
would
carry
a
woman
.
<EOS>
two
of
them
be
hunter
;
the
third
,
a
useful
road
-
horse
:
this
third
he
resolve
to
exchange
for
one
that
his
cousin
may
ride
;
he
know
where
such
a
one
be
to
be
meet
with
;
and
have
once
make
up
his
mind
,
the
whole
business
be
soon
complete
.
<EOS>
the
new
mare
prove
a
treasure
;
with
a
very
little
trouble
she
become
exactly
calculated
for
the
purpose
,
and
Fanny
be
then
put
in
almost
full
possession
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
suppose
before
that
anything
could
ever
suit
her
like
the
old
grey
pony
;
but
her
delight
in
Edmund
's
mare
be
far
beyond
any
former
pleasure
of
the
sort
;
and
the
addition
it
be
ever
receive
in
the
consideration
of
that
kindness
from
which
her
pleasure
sprung
,
be
beyond
all
her
word
to
express
.
<EOS>
She
regard
her
cousin
as
an
example
of
everything
good
and
great
,
as
possess
worth
which
no
one
but
herself
could
ever
appreciate
,
and
as
entitle
to
such
gratitude
from
her
as
no
feeling
could
be
strong
enough
to
pay
.
<EOS>
Her
sentiment
towards
him
be
compound
of
all
that
be
respectful
,
grateful
,
confiding
,
and
tender
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
horse
continue
in
name
,
as
well
as
fact
,
the
property
of
Edmund
,
Mrs.
Norris
could
tolerate
its
being
for
Fanny
's
use
;
and
have
Lady
Bertram
ever
think
about
her
own
objection
again
<EOS>
,
he
may
have
be
excuse
in
her
eye
for
not
wait
till
Sir
Thomas
's
return
in
September
,
for
when
September
come
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
be
still
abroad
,
and
without
any
near
prospect
of
finish
his
business
.
<EOS>
unfavourable
circumstance
have
suddenly
arise
at
a
moment
when
he
be
begin
to
turn
all
his
thought
towards
England
;
and
the
very
great
uncertainty
in
which
everything
be
then
involve
determine
him
on
send
home
his
son
,
and
wait
the
final
arrangement
by
himself
.
<EOS>
Tom
arrive
safely
,
bring
an
excellent
account
of
his
father
's
health
;
but
to
very
little
purpose
,
as
far
as
Mrs.
Norris
be
concern
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
's
send
away
his
son
seem
to
her
so
like
a
parent
's
care
,
under
the
influence
of
a
foreboding
of
evil
to
himself
,
that
she
could
not
help
feel
dreadful
presentiment
;
and
as
the
long
evening
of
autumn
come
on
,
be
so
terribly
haunted
by
these
idea
,
in
the
sad
solitariness
of
her
cottage

as
to
be
oblige
to
take
daily
refuge
in
the
dining

room
of
the
Park

<EOS>
the

winter
engagement

be
not

its
effect

in
the
course
of
their
progress

her
mind
become
so
pleasantly
occupy
in
superintend
the
fortune
of
her

niece

as
tolerably
to
quiet
her
nerve
.
<EOS>
"
if
poor
Sir
Thomas
be
fate
never
to
return
,
it
would
be
peculiarly
consoling
to
see
their
dear

well
marry

she
very
often
think

always
when
they

himself
in

<EOS>
He
be
a
heavy
young
man

with
not
more
than
common
sense

as
there

as
a
marriage

Mr.
Rushworth
would
give
her
the
enjoyment

<EOS>
Mrs.

be
most
zealous
in
promote
the
match
,
by
every
suggestion
and
contrivance
likely
to
enhance
its
desirableness

among
other
mean

by
seek
an
intimacy
with
the

Lady

to
go
through
ten
mile

a
morning
visit

It

Mrs.

Mrs.

Mrs.

so
short
an

<EOS>
It

Mr.

He
could
allow
his

It

very
much
in
want
of
some
variety
at
home

<EOS>
the
arrival
,
therefore
,
of
a
sister
whom
she
have
always
love
,
and
now
hope
to
retain
with
her
as
long
as
she
remain
single
,
be
highly
agreeable
;
and
her
chief
anxiety
be
lest
Mansfield
should
not
satisfy
the
habit
of
a
young
woman
who
have
be
mostly
use
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
be
not
entirely
free
from
similar
apprehension
,
though
they
arise
principally
from
doubt
of
her
sister
's
style
of
living
and
tone
of
society
;
and
it
be
not
till
after
she
have
try
in
vain
to
persuade
her
brother
to
settle
with
her
at
his
own
country
house
,
that
she
could
resolve
to
hazard
herself
among
her
other
relation
.
<EOS>
to
anything
like
a
permanence
of
abode
,
or
limitation
of
society
,
Henry
Crawford
have
,
unluckily
,
a
great
dislike
:
he
could
not
accommodate
his
sister
in
an
article
of
such
importance
;
but
he
escort
her
,
with
the
utmost
kindness
,
into
Northamptonshire
,
and
as
readily
engage
to
fetch
her
away
again
,
at
half
an
hour
's
notice
,
whenever
she
be
weary
of
the
place
.
  
<EOS>
the
meeting
be
very
satisfactory
on
each
side
.
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
find
a
sister
without
preciseness
or
rusticity
,
a
sister
's
husband
who
look
the
gentleman
,
and
a
house
commodious
and
well
fit
up
;
and
Mrs.
Grant
receive
in
those
whom
she
hope
to
love
better
than
ever
a
young
man
and
woman
of
very
prepossessing
appearance
.
<EOS>
Mary
Crawford
be
remarkably
pretty
;
Henry
,
though
not
handsome
,
have
air
and
countenance
;
the
manner
of
both
be
lively
and
pleasant
,
and
Mrs.
Grant
immediately
give
them
credit
for
everything
else
.
<EOS>
She
be
delighted
with
each
,
but
Mary
be
her
dear
object
;
and
have
never
be
able
to
glory
in
beauty
of
her
own
,
she
thoroughly
enjoy
the
power
of
be
proud
of
her
sister
's
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
wait
her
arrival
to
look
out
for
a
suitable
match
for
her
:
she
have
fix
on
Tom
Bertram
;
the
eld
son
of
a
baronet
be
not
too
good
for
a
girl
of
twenty
thousand
pound
,
with
all
the
elegance
and
accomplishment
which
Mrs.
Grant
foresaw
in
her
;
and
be
a
warm
-
hearted
,
unreserved
woman
,
Mary
have
not
be
three
hour
in
the
house
before
she
tell
her
what
she
have
plan
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
be
glad
to
find
a
family
of
such
consequence
so
very
near
them
,
and
not
at
all
displeased
either
at
her
sister
's
early
care
,
or
the
choice
it
have
fall
on
.
<EOS>
Matrimony
be
her
object
,
provide
she
could
marry
well
:
and
have
see
Mr.
Bertram
in
town
,
she
know
that
objection
could
no
more
be
make
to
his
person
than
to
his
situation
in
life
.
<EOS>
while
she
treat
it
as
a
joke
,
therefore
,
she
do
not
forget
to
think
of
it
seriously
.
<EOS>
the
scheme
be
soon
repeat
to
Henry
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
"
add
Mrs.
Grant
,
"
I
have
think
of
something
to
make
it
complete
.
<EOS>
I
should
dearly
love
to
settle
you
both
in
this
country
;
and
therefore
,
Henry
,
you
shall
marry
the
young
Miss
Bertram
,
a
nice

handsome

good

humoured

accomplish

who
will
make
you
very
happy

<EOS>
My

"
say
Mary
,
"
if
you
can
persuade
him
into
anything
of
the
sort
,
it
will
be
a
fresh
matter
of
delight
to
me
to
find
myself
allied
to
anybody
so
clever
,
and
I
shall
only
regret
that
you
have
not
half
a
dozen
daughter
to
dispose
of
.
<EOS>
if
you
can
persuade
Henry
to
marry
,
you
must
have
the
address
of
a
Frenchwoman
.
<EOS>
all
that
english
ability
can
do
have
be
try
already
.
<EOS>
I
have
three
very
particular
friend
who
have
be
all

for
him
in

turn

the
pain
which
they
,
their
mother

very
clever
woman

,
as
well
as
my
dear
aunt
and
myself

have
take
to
reason

coax

or
trick
him
into
marrying

be
inconceivable

<EOS>
He
be
the
most
horrible
flirt
that
can
be
imagine
.
<EOS>
if
your
Miss
Bertrams
do
not
like
to
have
their
heart
break
,
let
them
avoid
Henry

My

I

no

I
be
sure
you
be

good

<EOS>
You
will

Mary

<EOS>
You
will
allow
for
the
doubt
of
youth

inexperience

<EOS>
I
be
of
a
cautious
temper

unwilling
to
risk
my
happiness
in
a
hurry

<EOS>
nobody
can
think
more
highly
of

there

Mrs.

you
see
how
he
dwell
on
one
word

only
look
at
his
smile

<EOS>
I
assure
you
he
be
very
detestable

the

lesson
have
quite

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
pay

Mrs.

to

any

<EOS>
if
they
profess
a
disinclination

I

set
it
down
that

Dr.

laughingly
congratulate
Miss

the
state
herself

<EOS>
"
oh
yes
!
<EOS>
I
be
not
at
all
ashamed
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
everybody
marry
if
they
can
do
it
properly
:
I
do
not
like
to
have
people
throw
themselves
away
;
but
everybody
should
marry
as
soon
as
they
can
do
it
to
advantage

"
    
<EOS>
the
young
people
be
pleased
with
each
other
from
the
first

<EOS>
on

side
there
be
much
to
attract

their

<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
's
beauty
do
her
no
disservice

the
Miss
Bertrams

<EOS>
They
be
too
handsome
themselves
to
dislike
any
woman
for
be
so
too
,

be
almost
as
much
charm
as
their
brother
with
her
lively
dark
eye
,
clear
brown
complexion
,
and
general
prettiness
.
<EOS>
have
she
be
tall
,
full
form
,
and
fair
,
it
may
have
be
more
of
a
trial
:
but
as
it
be
,
there
could
be
no
comparison
;

she
be
most
allowably
a
sweet

pretty
girl

while
they
be
the
fine
young
woman
in
the
country

<EOS>
Her
brother
be
not
handsome
:
no
,
when
they
first
see
him
he
be
absolutely
plain
,
black
and
plain
;
but
still
he
be
the
gentleman
,
with
a
pleasing
address
.
<EOS>
the
second
meeting
prove
him
not
so
very
plain
:
he
be
plain
,
to
be
sure
,
but
then
he
have
so
much
countenance
,
and
his
tooth
be
so
good
,
and
he
be
so
well
make
,
that
one
soon
forget
he
be
plain
;
and
after
a
third
interview
,
after
dine
in
company
with
him
at
the
Parsonage
,
he
be
no
longer
allow
to
be
call
so

anybody

<EOS>
He
be
,
in
fact
,
the
most
agreeable
young
man
the
sister
have
ever
know
,
and
they
be
equally
delighted
with
him
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bertram
's
engagement
make
him
in
equity
the
property
of
Julia

of
which
Julia
be
fully
aware

before
he
have
be
at
Mansfield
a
week

she
be
quite
ready

in

Maria

the

He
do

with
sense

ought

he

great
latitude

I

I

there
be
nothing
to
call
him
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
It
delight
Mrs.
Grant
to
keep
them
both
with
her
,
and
Dr.
Grant
be
exceedingly
well
contented
to
have
it
so
:
a
talk
pretty
young
woman
like
Miss
Crawford
be
always
pleasant
society
to
an
indolent
,
stay
-
at
-
home
man
;
and
Mr.
Crawford
's
be
his
guest
be
an
excuse
for
drink
claret
every
day
.
  
<EOS>
the
Miss
Bertrams
'
admiration
of
Mr.
Crawford
be
more
rapturous
than
anything
which
Miss
Crawford
's
habit
make
her
likely
to
feel
.
<EOS>
She
acknowledge
,
however
,
that
the
Mr.
Bertrams
be
very
fine
young
man
,
that
two
such
young
man
be
not
often
see
together
even
in
London
,
and
that
their
manner
,
particularly
those
of
the
eld
,
be
very
good
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
have
be
much
in
London
,
and
have
more
liveliness
and
gallantry
than
Edmund
,
and
must
,
therefore
,
be
prefer
;
and
,
indeed
,
his
be
the
eld
be
another
strong
claim
.
<EOS>
She
have
feel
an
early
presentiment
that
she
_
should
_
<EOS>
like
the
eld
good
.
<EOS>
She
know
it
be
her
way
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
Bertram
must
have
be
think
pleasant
,
indeed
,
at
any
rate
;
he
be
the
sort
of
young
man
to
be
generally
like
,
his
agreeableness
be
of
the
kind
to
be
oftener
<EOS>
find
agreeable
than
some
endowment
of
a
high
stamp
,
for
he
have
easy
manner
,
excellent
spirit
,
a
large
acquaintance
,
and
a
great
deal
to
say
;
and
the
reversion
of
Mansfield
Park
,
and
a
baronetcy
,
do
no
harm
to
all
this
.
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
soon
feel
that
he
and
his
situation
may
do
.
<EOS>
She
look
about
her
with
due
consideration
,
and
find
almost
everything
in
his
favour
:
a
park
,
a
real
park
,
five
mile
round
,
a
spacious
modern
-
build
house
,
so
well
placed
and
well
screened
as
to
deserve
to
be
in
any
collection
of
engraving
of
gentleman
's
seat
in
the
kingdom
,
and
want
only
to
be
completely
new
furnished
 
pleasant
sister
,
a
quiet
mother
,
and
an
agreeable
man
himself
 
with
the
advantage
of
be
tie
up
from
much
gaming
at
present
by
a
promise
to
his
father
,
and
of
be
Sir
Thomas
hereafter
.
<EOS>
It
may
do
very
well
;
she
believe
she
should
accept
him
;
and
she
begin
accordingly
to
interest
herself
a
little
about
the
horse
which
he
have
to
run
at
the
B
race
.
  
<EOS>
these
race
be
to
call
him
away
not
long
after
their
acquaintance
begin
;
and
as
it
appear
that
the
family
do
not
,
from
his
usual
going
on
,
expect
him
back
again
for
many
week
,
it
would
bring
his
passion
to
an
early
proof
.
<EOS>
much
be
say
on
his
side
to
induce
her
to
attend
the
race
,
and
scheme
be
make
for
a
large
party
to
them
,
with
all
the
eagerness
of
inclination
,
but
it
would
only
do
to
be
talk
of
.
  
<EOS>
and
Fanny
,
what
be
_
<EOS>
she
<EOS>
_
do
and
think
all
this
while
?
<EOS>
and
what
be
_
<EOS>
her
_
opinion
of
the
newcomer
?
<EOS>
few
young
lady
of
eighteen
could
be
less
call
on
to
speak
their
opinion
than
Fanny
.
<EOS>
in
a
quiet
way
,
very
little
attend
to
,
she
pay
her
tribute
of
admiration
to
Miss
Crawford
's
beauty
;
but
as
she
still
continue
to
think
Mr.
Crawford
very
plain
,
in
spite
of
her
two
cousin
have
repeatedly
prove
the
contrary
,
she
never
mention
_
him
_
.
<EOS>
the
notice
,
which
she
excite
herself
,
be
to
this
effect
.
<EOS>
"
I
begin

to
understand
you

Miss

I

<EOS>
She

at
the
Parsonage
,
with
the
rest
of
you
,
which
seem
like
be
_
out

and
yet
she

so
little

that
I

hardly
suppose
she

"
  
<EOS>
Edmund
,
to
whom
this
be
chiefly
address

reply
,
"
I
believe
I
know
what
you

but
I
will
not
undertake
to
answer
the

<EOS>
My

grow
up
.
<EOS>
She
have
the
age
and
sense
of
a
woman
,
but
the
out
and
not
out
be
beyond
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
yet
,
in
general
,
nothing
can
be
more
easily
ascertain
.
<EOS>
the
distinction
be
so
broad

<EOS>
manner
as
well
as
appearance
be
,
generally
speak
,
so
totally
different
.
<EOS>
till
now
,
I
could
not
have
suppose
it
possible
to
be
mistake
as
to
a
girl
's
be
out
or
not
.
<EOS>
a
girl
not
out
have
always
the
same
sort
of
dress
:
a
close
bonnet
,
for
instance
;
look
very
demure
,
and
never
say
a
word
.
<EOS>
You
may
smile
,
but
it
be
so
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
;
and
except
that
it
be
sometimes
carry
a
little
too
far
,
it
be
all
very
proper
.
<EOS>
girl
should
be
quiet
and
modest
.
<EOS>
the
most
objectionable
part
be
,
that
the
alteration
of
manner
on
be
introduce
into
company
be
frequently
too
sudden
.
<EOS>
They
sometimes
pass
in
such
very
little
time
from
reserve
to
quite
the
opposite
 
to
confidence
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
that
_
be
the
faulty
part
of
the
present
system
.
<EOS>
one
do
not
like
to
see
a
girl
of
eighteen
or
nineteen
so
immediately
up
to
every
thing
 
<EOS>
and
perhaps
when
one
have
see
her
hardly
able
to
speak
the
year
before
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bertram
,
I
dare
say
_
you
_
have
sometimes
meet
with
such
change
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
have
,
but
this
be
hardly
fair
;
I
see
what
you
be
at
.
<EOS>
You
be
quiz
me
and
Miss
Anderson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
Miss
Anderson
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
who
or
what
you
mean
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
but
I
_
will
_
quiz
you
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
,
if
you
will
tell
me
what
about
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
you
carry
it
off
very
well
,
but
I
can
not
be
quite
so
far
impose
on
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
have
Miss
Anderson
in
your
eye
,
in
describe
an
altered
young
lady
.
<EOS>
You
paint
too
accurately
for
mistake
.
<EOS>
It
be
exactly
so
.
<EOS>
the
Andersons
of
Baker
Street
.
<EOS>
We
be
speak
of
them
the
other
day
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
Edmund
,
you
have
hear
me
mention
Charles
Anderson
.
<EOS>
the
circumstance
be
precisely
as
this
lady
have
represent
it
.
<EOS>
when
Anderson
first
introduce
me
to
his
family
,
about
two
year
ago
,
his
sister
be
not
_
out
_
,
and
I
could
not
get
her
to
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
sit
there
an
hour
one
morning
wait
for
Anderson
,
with
only
her
and
a
little
girl
or
two
in
the
room
,
the
governess
be
sick
or
run
away
,
and
the
mother
in
and
out
every
moment
with
letter
of
business
,
and
I
could
hardly
get
a
word
or
a
look
from
the
young
lady
 
<EOS>
nothing
like
a
civil
answer
 
<EOS>
she
screw
up
her
mouth
,
and
turn
from
me
with
such
an
air
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
her
again
for
a
twelvemonth
.
<EOS>
She
be
then
_
out
_
.
<EOS>
I
meet
her
at
Mrs.
Holford
's
,
and
do
not
recollect
her
.
<EOS>
She
come
up
to
me
,
claim
me
as
an
acquaintance
,
stare
me
out
of
countenance
;
and
talk
and
laugh
till
I
do
not
know
which
way
to
look
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
must
be
the
jest
of
the
room
at
the
time
,
and
Miss
Crawford
,
it
be
plain
,
have
hear
the
story
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
a
very
pretty
story
<EOS>
it
be
,
and
with
more
truth
in
it
,
I
dare
say
,
than
do
credit
to
Miss
Anderson
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
common
a
fault
.
<EOS>
mother
certainly
have
not
yet
get
quite
the
right
way
of
manage
their
daughter
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
where
the
error
lie
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
pretend
to
set
people
right
,
but
I
do
see
that
they
be
often
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
those
who
be
show
the
world
what
female
manner
_
should
_
be
,
"
say
Mr.
Bertram
gallantly
,
"
be
do
a
great
deal
to
set
them
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
error
be
plain
enough
,
"
say
the
less
courteous
Edmund
;
"
such
girl
be
ill
bring
up
.
<EOS>
They
be
give
wrong
notion
from
the
beginning
.
<EOS>
They
be
always
act
upon
motive
of
vanity
,
and
there
be
no
more
real
modesty
in
their
behaviour
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
before
_
they
appear
in
public
than
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
reply
Miss
Crawford
hesitatingly
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
can
not
agree
with
you
there
.
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
the
modest
part
of
the
business
.
<EOS>
It
be
much
bad
to
have
girl
not
out
give
themselves
the
same
air
and
take
the
same
liberty
as
if
they
be
,
which
I
have
see
do
.
<EOS>
that
be
bad
than
anything
 
quite
disgusting
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
_
that
_
be
very
inconvenient
indeed
,
"
say
Mr.
Bertram
.
<EOS>
"
It
lead
one
astray
;
one
do
not
know
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
the
close
bonnet
and
demure
air
you
describe
<EOS>
so
well
<EOS>
(
and
nothing
be
ever
juster
)
,
tell
one
what
be
expect
;
but
I
get
into
a
dreadful
scrape
last
year
from
the
want
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
go
down
to
ramsgate
for
a
week
with
a
friend
last
September
,
just
after
my
return
from
the
West
Indies
.
<EOS>
My
friend
Sneyd
 
you
have
hear
me
speak
of
Sneyd
,
Edmund
 
<EOS>
his
father
,
and
mother
,
and
sister
,
be
there
,
all
new
to
me
.
<EOS>
when
we
reach
Albion
Place
they
be
out
;
we
go
after
them
,
and
find
them
on
the
pier
:
Mrs.
and
the
two
Miss
Sneyds
,
with
other
of
their
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
I
make
my
bow
in
form
;
and
as
Mrs.
Sneyd
be
surround
by
man
,
attach
myself
to
one
of
her
daughter
,
walk
by
her
side
all
the
way
home
,
and
make
myself
as
agreeable
as
I
could
;
the
young
lady
perfectly
easy
in
her
manner
,
and
as
ready
to
talk
as
to
listen
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
a
suspicion
that
I
could
be
do
anything
wrong
.
<EOS>
They
look
just
the
same
:
both
well
-
dress
,
with
veil
and
parasol
like
other
girl
;
but
I
afterwards
find
that
I
have
be
give
all
my
attention
to
the
young
,
who
be
not
_
out
_
,
and
have
most
excessively
offend
the
eld
.
<EOS>
Miss
Augusta
ought
not
to
have
be
notice
for
the
next
six
month
;
and
Miss
Sneyd
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
have
never
forgive
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
bad
indeed
.
<EOS>
Poor
Miss
Sneyd
.
<EOS>
though
I
have
no
young
sister
,
I
feel
for
her
.
<EOS>
to
be
neglect
before
one
's
time
must
be
very
vexatious
;
but
it
be
entirely
the
mother
's
fault
.
<EOS>
Miss
Augusta
should
have
be
with
her
governess
.
<EOS>
such
half
-
and
-
half
doing
never
prosper
.
<EOS>
but
now
I
must
be
satisfied
about
Miss
Price
.
<EOS>
do
she
go
to
ball
?
<EOS>
do
she
dine
out
every
where
,
as
well
as
at
my
sister
's
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
reply
Edmund
;
"
I
do
not
think
she
have
ever
be
to
a
ball
.
<EOS>
My
mother
seldom
go
into
company
herself
,
and
dine
nowhere
<EOS>
but
with
Mrs.
Grant
,
and
Fanny
stay
at
home
with
_
her
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
then
the
point
be
clear
.
<EOS>
Miss
Price
be
not
out
.
"
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Bertram
set
off
for
 
,
and
Miss
Crawford
be
prepared
to
find
a
great
chasm
in
their
society
,
and
to
miss
him
decidedly
in
the
meeting
which
be
now
become
almost
daily
between
the
family
;
and
on
their
all
dining
together
at
the
Park
soon
after
his
going
,
she
retake
her
choose
place
near
the
bottom
of
the
table
,
fully
expect
to
feel
a
most
melancholy
difference
in
the
change
of
master
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
very
flat
business
,
she
be
sure
.
<EOS>
in
comparison
with
his
brother
,
Edmund
would
have
nothing
to
say
.
<EOS>
the
soup
would
be
send
round
in
a
most
spiritless
manner
,
wine
drink
without
any
smile
or
agreeable
trifling
,
and
the
venison
cut
up
without
supply
one
pleasant
anecdote
of
any
former
haunch
,
or
a
single
entertaining
story
,
about
"
my
friend
such
a
one
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
must
try
to
find
amusement
in
what
be
pass
at
the
upper
end
of
the
table
,
and
in
observe
Mr.
Rushworth
,
who
be
now
make
his
appearance
at
Mansfield
for
the
first
time
since
the
Crawfords
'
arrival
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
visit
a
friend
in
the
neighbouring
county
,
and
that
friend
have
recently
have
his
ground
lay
out
by
an
improver
,
Mr.
Rushworth
be
return
with
his
head
full
of
the
subject
,
and
very
eager
to
be
improve
his
own
place
in
the
same
way
;
and
though
not
say
much
to
the
purpose
,
could
talk
of
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
the
subject
have
be
already
handle
in
the
drawing
-
room
;
it
be
revive
in
the
dining
-
parlour
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bertram
's
attention
and
opinion
be
evidently
his
chief
aim
;
and
though
her
deportment
show
rather
conscious
superiority
than
any
solicitude
to
oblige
him
,
the
mention
of
Sotherton
Court
,
and
the
idea
attach
to
it
,
give
her
a
feeling
of
complacency
,
which
prevent
her
from
be
very
ungracious
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
could
see
Compton
,
"
say
he
;
"
it
be
the
most
complete
thing
!

I
never
see
a
place
so
altered
in
my
life

I
tell

I
do
not
know
where
I
be
.
<EOS>
the
approach
_
now
_
,
be
one
of
the
fine
thing
in
the
country
:
you
see
the
house
in
the
most
surprising
manner
.
<EOS>
I
declare
,
when
I
get
back
to
Sotherton
yesterday
,
it
look
like
a
prison
 
quite
a
dismal
old
prison
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
for
shame
!
"
cry
Mrs.
Norris
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
prison
indeed
?
<EOS>
Sotherton
Court
be
the
noble
old
place
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
want
improvement
,
madam
,
beyond
anything
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
a
place
that
want
so
much
improvement
in
my
life
;
and
it
be
so
forlorn
that
I
do
not
know
what
can
be
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
wonder
that
Mr.
Rushworth
should
think
so
at
present
,
"
say
Mrs.
Grant
to
Mrs.
Norris
,
with
a
smile
;
"
but
depend
upon
it
<EOS>
,
Sotherton
will
have
_
every
_
improvement
in
time
which
his
heart
can
desire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
try
to
do
something
with
it
,
"
say
Mr.
Rushworth
,
"
but
I
do
not
know
what
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
have
some
good
friend
to
help
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Your
good
friend
upon
such
an
occasion
,
"
say
Miss
Bertram
calmly
,
"
would
be
Mr.
Repton
,
I
imagine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
what
I
be
think
of
.
<EOS>
as
he
have
do
so
well
by
Smith
,
I
think
I
have
better
have
him
at
once
.
<EOS>
His
term
be
five
guinea
a
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
and
if
they
be
_
ten
_
,
"
cry
Mrs.
Norris
,
"
I
be
sure
<EOS>
_
you
_
need
not
regard
it
.
<EOS>
the
expense
nee
not
be
any
impediment
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
you
,
I
should
not
think
of
the
expense
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
everything
do
in
the
good
style
,
and
make
as
nice
as
possible
.
<EOS>
such
a
place
as
Sotherton
Court
deserve
everything
that
taste
and
money
can
do
.
<EOS>
You
have
space
to
work
upon
there
,
and
ground
that
will
well
reward
you
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
if
I
have
anything
within
the
fiftieth
part
of
the
size
of
Sotherton
,
I
should
be
always
plant
and
improve
,
for
naturally
I
be
excessively
fond
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
too
ridiculous
for
me
to
attempt
anything
where
I
be
now
,
with
my
little
half
acre
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
quite
a
burlesque
.
<EOS>
but
if
I
have
more
room
,
I
should
take
a
prodigious
delight
in
improve
and
plant
.
<EOS>
We
do
a
vast
deal
in
that
way
at
the
Parsonage
:
we
make
it
quite
a
different
place
from
what
it
be
when
we
first
have
it
.
<EOS>
You
young
one
do
not
remember
much
about
it
,
perhaps
;
but
if
dear
Sir
Thomas
be
here
,
he
could
tell
you
what
improvement
we
make
:
and
a
great
deal
more
would
have
be
do
,
but
for
poor
Mr.
Norris
's
sad
state
of
health
.
<EOS>
He
could
hardly
ever
get
out
,
poor
man
,
to
enjoy
anything
,
and
_
that
_
dishearten
me
from

several
thing
that
Sir
Thomas

I
use

talk

<EOS>
if
it
have
not
be
for

we
should
have
carry
on
the
garden
wall
,
and
make
the
plantation
to
shut
out
the
churchyard
,
just
as
Dr.
Grant
have
do
.
<EOS>
We
be
always
do
something
as
it
be

<EOS>
It
be
only
the
spring
twelvemonth
before
Mr.
Norris

death
that
we
put
in
the
apricot
against
the

such
a
noble
tree

to
such
perfection

"

Dr.

.
<EOS>
"
the
soil

good

and
I
never

You

Dr.

:
"
these
potato
have
as
much
the
flavour
of
a
Moor
Park
apricot
as
the
fruit
from
that
tree

<EOS>
It
be
an
insipid
fruit
at
the
good
;

eatable

scarcely

with
one

for
it

so
valuable

fruit

with
a
little
assistance

ours
be
such
a
remarkably
large

fair

,
for
a

while

place
of
the
improvement

Sotherton

<EOS>
Dr.
Grant

Mrs.

be
seldom
good

their
acquaintance
have
begin
in
dilapidation

pretty

<EOS>
Mr.
Rushworth
be
eager
to
assure
her

of
his
acquiescence

try
to
make
out
something
complimentary
;
but
,
between
his
submission
to
_

taste
,
and
his
have
always
intend
the

with
the
superadde
object
of
profess
attention

wine

<EOS>
Mr.
Rushworth
,
however
,
though
not
usually
a
great
talker
,
have
still
more
to
say
on
the
subject
next
his
heart

"
<EOS>
Smith
have
not
much
above
a
hundred
acre
altogether
in
his
ground
,
which
be
little
enough
,
and
make
it
more
surprising
that
the
place
can
have
be
so
improve
.
<EOS>
now
,
at
Sotherton
we
have
a
good
seven
hundred
,
without
reckon
the
water
meadow
;
so
that
I
think
,
if
so
much
could
be
do
at
Compton
,
we
need
not
despair
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
<EOS>
two
or
three
fine
old
tree
cut
down
,
that
grow
too
near
the
house
,
and
it
open
the
prospect
amazingly
,
which
make
me
think
that
Repton
,
or
anybody
of
that
sort
,
would
certainly
have
the
avenue
at
Sotherton
down
:
the
avenue

to

Miss

it
most
become
to

"
the

<EOS>
oh
!

I

I
collect

say
Miss

that
Sotherton
be
an
old

place
of
some
grandeur

in

building

the
house

build

unfavourable
for

the
wood

fine

there
be
a

,
I
dare

may
be
make
a
good
deal
of

<EOS>
Mr.
Rushworth
be
quite
right

I
think
,
in
meaning
to
give
it
a
modern
dress

I
have
no

that
it
will
be
all
do
extremely
well

have
I
a
place

new
fashion

I

not

myself

I
would
rather
have

pretty

soon
find
necessary
to
be
improve

for
three

we
be
all
dirt
and
confusion

without
a
gravel
walk
to
step
on

a
bench
fit

would
have
everything
as
complete

shrubbery

garden

rustic

innumerable

I
dare

astonish

to
want
a
horse

cart
in
the
country
seem
impossible

so
I
tell
my

to
speak
for
one
directly

as
I
can
not
look
out
of
my
dressing

closet
without
see
one
farmyard
,
nor
walk
in
the
shrubbery
without
pass
another

I
think
it
would
be
only
ask

have
,

be
rather
grieve
that
I
could
not
give
the
advantage
to
all

my
surprise

when
I
find
that
I
have
be
ask
the
most
unreasonable

most
impossible
thing
in

have
offend
all
the
farmer

all

as
for
Dr.
Grant

bailiff

I
believe
I
have
better
keep
out
of

way

my
brother

in

law
himself
,
who
be
all
kindness

rather
black
upon

You
could
not
be
expect
to
have
think
on

subject
before

when
you
_
do

think
of
it

you
must
see
the
importance

get
in
the
grass

<EOS>
the
hire
of
a
cart
at
any

may
not
be
so
easy
as
you
suppose
:
our
farmer
be
not
in
the
habit
of
let
them
out
;
but
,
in
harvest
,
it
must
be
quite
out
of
their
power
to
spare
a
horse

I

down

part

speech

enforce

warmly

persuade
that
no
judgment
could
be
equal
to
her
brother
's
;
and
as
Miss
Bertram
catch
at
the
idea
likewise
,
and
give
it
her
full
support
,
declare
that
,
in
her
opinion
,
it
be
infinitely
well
to
consult
with
friend

disintereste
adviser

than
immediately
to
throw
the
business
into

hand

professional
man

at

do
him
the
honour
of
come
over
to
Sotherton

take
a
bed
there
;
when
Mrs.

their

spot

that
may
be
of

small
use

for

I

nothing

have
no
horse

be
there
nothing

conversation

strike
you

not
quite
right

<EOS>
"
oh
yes
!
<EOS>
she
ought
not
to
have
speak
of
her
uncle
as
she
do

<EOS>
I
be
quite
astonished
.
<EOS>
an
uncle
with
whom
she
have
be
live
so
many
year
,
and
who
,
whatever
his
fault
may
be

be
so
very
fond
of
her
brother
,
treat
him
,
they
say
,
quite
like
a
son

<EOS>
I
could
not
have
believe
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
would
be
strike
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
wrong
;
very
indecorous
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
very
ungrateful
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ungrateful
be
a
strong
word
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
her
uncle
have
any
claim
to
her
_
gratitude
_
;
his
wife
certainly
have
;
and
it
be
the
warmth
of
her
respect
for
her
aunt
's
memory
which
mislead
her
here
.
<EOS>
She
be
awkwardly
circumstance
.
<EOS>
with
such
warm
feeling
and
lively
spirit
it
must
be
difficult
to
do
justice
to
her
affection
for
Mrs.
Crawford
,
without
throw
a
shade
on
the
Admiral
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
pretend
to
know
which
be
most
to
blame
in
their
disagreement
,
though
the
Admiral
's
present
conduct
may
incline
one
to
the
side
of
his
wife
;
but
it
be
natural
and
amiable
that
Miss
Crawford
should
acquit
her
aunt
entirely
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
censure
her
_
opinion
_
;
but
there
certainly
_
be
_
impropriety
in
make
them
public
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
you
think
,
"
say
Fanny
,
after
a
little
consideration
,
"
that
this
impropriety
be
a
reflection
itself
upon
Mrs.
Crawford
,
as
her
niece
have
be
entirely
bring
up
by
her
?
<EOS>
She
can
not
have
give
her
right
notion
of
what
be
due
to
the
Admiral
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
fair
remark
.
<EOS>
yes
,
we
must
suppose
the
fault
of
the
niece
to
have
be
those
of
the
aunt
;
and
it
make
one
more
sensible
of
the
disadvantage
she
have
be
under
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
her
present
home
must
do
her
good
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grant
's
manner
be
just
what
they
ought
to
be
.
<EOS>
She
speak
of
her
brother
with
a
very
pleasing
affection
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
,
except
as
to
his
write
her
such
short
letter
.
<EOS>
She
make
me
almost
laugh
;
but
I
can
not
rate
so
very
highly
the
love
or
good

nature
of
a
brother
who
will
not
give
himself
the
trouble
of
write
anything
worth
read

they
be
separate

I
be
sure
William
would
never
have

_
me
_
<EOS>
so
,
under
any
circumstance

<EOS>
and
what
right
have
she
to
suppose

would
not
write
long
letter

there

She

form
her

gain
her
affection

he

a

her

like
him
;
though
at
this
period
,
and
on
this
subject
,
there
begin
now
to
be
some
danger
of
dissimilarity
,
for
he
be
in
a
line
of
admiration
of
Miss
Crawford
,
which
may
lead
him
where
Fanny
could
not
follow
.
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
's
attraction
do
not
lessen
.
<EOS>
the
harp
arrive
,
and
rather
add
to
her
beauty
,
wit
,
and
good
-
humour
;
for
she
play
with
the
great
obligingness
,
with
an
expression
and
taste
which
be
peculiarly
become
,
and
there
be
something
clever
to
be
say
at
the
close
of
every
air
.
<EOS>
Edmund
be
at
the
Parsonage
every
day
,
to
be
indulge
with
his
favourite
instrument
:
one
morning
secure
an
invitation
for
the
next
;
for
the
lady
could
not
be
unwilling
to
have
a
listener
,
and
every
thing
be
soon
in
a
fair
train
.
  
<EOS>
a
young
woman
,
pretty
,
lively
,
with
a
harp
as
elegant
as
herself
,
and
both
place
near
a
window
,
cut
down
to
the
ground
,
and
opening
on
a
little
lawn
,
surround
by
shrub
in
the
rich
foliage
of
summer
,
be
enough
to
catch
any
man
's
heart
.
<EOS>
the
season
,
the
scene
,
the
air
,
be
all
favourable
to
tenderness
and
sentiment
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grant
and
her
tambour
frame
be
not
without
their
use
:
it
be
all
in
harmony
;
and
as
everything
will
turn
to
account
when
love
be
once
set
go
,
even
the
sandwich
tray
,
and
Dr.
Grant
do
the
honour
of
it
,
be
worth
look
at
.
<EOS>
without
study
the
business
,
however
,
or
know
what
he
be
about
,
Edmund
be
begin
,
at
the
end
of
a
week
of
such
intercourse
,
to
be
a
good
deal
in
love
;
and
to
the
credit
of
the
lady
it
may
be
add
that
,
without
his
be
a
man
of
the
world
or
an
eld
brother
,
without
any
of
the
art
of
flattery
or
the
gaiety
of
small
talk
,
he
begin
to
be
agreeable
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
feel
it
to
be
so
,
though
she
have
not
foresee
,
and
could
hardly
understand
it
;
for
he
be
not
pleasant
by
any
common
rule
<EOS>
:
he
talk
no
nonsense
;
he
pay
no
compliment
;
his
opinion
be
unbend
,
his
attention
tranquil
and
simple
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
charm
,
perhaps
,
in
his
sincerity
,
his
steadiness
,
his
integrity
,
which
Miss
Crawford
may
be
equal
to
feel
,
though
not
equal
to
discuss
with
herself
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
think
very
much
about
it
,
however
:
he
please
her
for
the
present
;
she
like
to
have
him
near
her
;
it
be
enough
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
could
not
wonder
that
Edmund
be
at
the
Parsonage
every
morning
;
she
would
gladly
have
be
there
too
,
may
she
have
go
in
uninvited
and
unnoticed
,
to
hear
the
harp
;
neither
could
she
wonder
that
,
when
the
evening
stroll
be
over
,
and
the
two
family
part
again
,
he
should
think
it
right
to
attend
Mrs.
Grant
and
her
sister
to
their
home
,
while
Mr.
Crawford
be
devote
to
the
lady
of
the
Park
;
but
she
think
it
a
very
bad
exchange
;
and
if
Edmund
be
not
there
to
mix
the
wine
and
water
for
her
,
would
rather
go
without
it
than
not
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
little
surprised
that
he
could
spend
so
many
hour
with
Miss
Crawford
,
and
not
see
more
of
the
sort
of
fault
which
he
have
already
observe
,
and
of
which
_
she
_
be
almost
always
remind
by
a
something
of
the
same
nature
whenever
she
be
in
her
company
;
but
so
it
be
.
<EOS>
Edmund
be
fond
of
speak
to
her
of
Miss
Crawford
,
but
he
seem
to
think
it
enough
that
the
Admiral
have
since
be
spare
;
and
she
scruple
to
point
out
her
own
remark
to
him
,
lest
it
should
appear
like
ill
-
nature
.
<EOS>
the
first
actual
pain
which
Miss
Crawford
occasion
her
be
the
consequence
of
an
inclination
to
learn
to
ride
,
which
the
former
caught
,
soon
after
her
be
settle
at
Mansfield
,
from
the
example
of
the
young
lady
at
the
Park
,
and
which
,
when
Edmund
's
acquaintance
with
her
increase
,
lead
to
his
encourage
the
wish
,
and
the
offer
of
his
own
quiet
mare
for
the
purpose
of
her
first
attempt
,
as
the
best
fit
for
a
beginner
that
either
stable
could
furnish
.
<EOS>
no
pain
,
no
injury
,
however
,
be
design
by
him
to
his
cousin
in
this
offer
:
_
<EOS>
she
_
be
not
to
lose
a
day
's
exercise
by
it
.
<EOS>
the
mare
be
only
to
be
take
down
to
the
Parsonage
half
an
hour
before
her
ride
be
to
begin
;
and
Fanny
,
on
its
be
first
propose
,
so
far
from
feel
slight
,
be
almost
over
-
power
with
gratitude
that
he
should
be
ask
her
leave
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
make
her
first
essay
with
great
credit
to
herself
,
and
no
inconvenience
to
Fanny
.
<EOS>
Edmund
,
who
have
take
down
the
mare
and
preside
at
the
whole
,
return
with
it
in
excellent
time
,
before
either
Fanny
or
the
steady
old
coachman
,
who
always
attend
her
when
she
ride
without
her
cousin
,
be
ready
to
set
forward
.
<EOS>
the
second
day
's
trial
be
not
so
guiltless
.
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
's
enjoyment
of
riding
be
such
that
she
do
not
know
how
to
leave
off
.
<EOS>
active
and
fearless
,
and
though
rather
small
,
strongly
make
,
she
seem
form
for
a
horsewoman
;
and
to
the
pure
genuine
pleasure
of
the
exercise
,
something
be
probably
add
in
Edmund
's
attendance
and
instruction
,
and
something
more
in
the
conviction
of
very
much
surpass
her
sex
in
general
by
her
early
progress
,
to
make
her
unwilling
to
dismount
.
<EOS>
Fanny
be
ready
and
wait
,
and
Mrs.
Norris
be
begin
to
scold
her
for
not
be
go
,
and
still
no
horse
be
announce
,
no
Edmund
appear
.
<EOS>
to
avoid
her
aunt
,
and
look
for
him
,
she
go
out
.
  
<EOS>
the
house
,
though
scarcely
half
a
mile
apart
,
be
not
within
sight
of
each
other
;
but
,
by
walk
fifty
yard
from
the
hall
door
,
she
could
look
down
the
park
,
and
command
a
view
of
the
Parsonage
and
all
its
demesne
,
gently
rise
beyond
the
village
road
;
and
in
Dr.
Grant
's
meadow
she
immediately
see
the
group
 
Edmund
and
Miss
Crawford
both
on
horse
-
back
,
ride
side
by
side
,
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Grant
,
and
Mr.
Crawford
,
with
two
or
three
groom
,
stand
about
and
look
on
.
<EOS>
a
happy
party
it
appear
to
her
,
all
interested
in
one
object
:
cheerful
beyond
a
doubt
,
for
the
sound
of
merriment
ascend
even
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
sound
which
do
not
make
_
her
_
cheerful
;
she
wonder
that
Edmund
should
forget
her
,
and
feel
a
pang
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
turn
her
eye
from
the
meadow
;
she
could
not
help
watch
all
that
pass
.
<EOS>
at
first
Miss
Crawford
and
her
companion
make
the
circuit
of
the
field
,
which
be
not
small
,
at
a
foot
's
pace
;
then
,
at
_
her
_
apparent
suggestion
,
they
rise
into
a
canter
;
and
to
Fanny
's
timid
nature
it
be
most
astonishing
to
see
how
well
she
sit
.
<EOS>
after
a
few
minute
they
stop
entirely
.
<EOS>
Edmund
be
close
to
her
;
he
be
speak
to
her
;
he
be
evidently
direct
her
management
of
the
bridle
;
he
have
hold
of
her
hand
;
she
see
it
,
or
the
imagination
supply
what
the
eye
could
not
reach
.
<EOS>
She
must
not
wonder
at
all
this
;
what
could
be
more
natural
than
that
Edmund
should
be
make
himself
useful
,
and
prove
his
good
-
nature
by
any
one
?
<EOS>
She
could
not
but
think
,
indeed
,
that
Mr.
Crawford
may
as
well
have
save
him
the
trouble
;
that
it
would
have
be
particularly
proper
and
become
in
a
brother
to
have
do
it
himself
;
but
Mr.
Crawford
,
with
all
his
boasted
good
-
nature
,
and
all
his
coachmanship
,
probably
know
nothing
of
the
matter
,
and
have
no
active
kindness
in
comparison
of
Edmund
.
<EOS>
She
begin
to
think
it
rather
hard
upon
the
mare
to
have
such
double
duty
;
if
she
be
forget
,
the
poor
mare
should
be
remember
.
  
<EOS>
Her
feeling
for
one
and
the
other
be
soon
a
little
tranquillise
by
see
the
party
in
the
meadow
disperse
,
and
Miss
Crawford
still
on
horseback
,
but
attend
by
Edmund
on
foot
,
pass
through
a
gate
into
the
lane
,
and
so
into
the
park
,
and
make
towards
the
spot
where
she
stand
.
<EOS>
She
begin
then
to
be
afraid
of
appear
rude
and
impatient
;
and
walk
to
meet
them
with
a
great
anxiety
to
avoid
the
suspicion
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Miss
Price
,
"
say
Miss
Crawford
,
as
soon
as
she
be
at
all
within
hearing
,

I
be
come
to
make
my
own
apology
for
keep
you

I
have
nothing
in
the
world
to
say
for
myself
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
be
very
late
,
and
that
I
be
behave
extremely
ill
;
and
therefore
,
if
you
please

you
must
forgive
me
.
<EOS>
selfishness
must
always
be
forgive

you
know
,
because
there
be
no
hope
of
a
cure

"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
's
answer
be
extremely
civil
,
and
Edmund
add
his
conviction
that
she
could
be
in
no
hurry
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
for
there
be
more
than
time
enough

<EOS>
when
they

no

I

glad

her
a
long

any

will
do
for

out

pleased

<EOS>
everything
answer
;
it
be
all
gaiety
and
good

humour
,
the
heat
only
supply
inconvenience
enough
to
be
talk
of
with
pleasure
 
till
the
fourth
day
,
when
the
happiness
of

of
the
party
be
exceedingly
clouded

Miss

the
one
.
<EOS>
Edmund

at
the
Parsonage

<EOS>
It

mean
and
do
by
Mrs.
Grant
,
with
perfect
good

humour
,
on
Mr.
Rushworth
's
account
,
who
be
partly
expect
at
the
Park
that
day
;
but
it
be
feel
as
a
very
grievous
injury
,
and
her
good
manner
be
severely
tax
to
conceal
her
vexation
and
anger
till
she
reach
home
.
<EOS>
as
Mr.
Rushworth
do
_

<EOS>
,
the
injury
be
increase
,
and
she
have
not
even
the
relief
of
shew
her
power
over
him
;
she
could
only
be
sullen
to
her
mother
,
aunt
,
and
cousin
,
and
throw
as
great
a
gloom
as
possible
over
their
dinner
and
dessert
.
  
<EOS>
between
ten
and
eleven
Edmund
and
Julia
walk
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
fresh
with
the
evening
air
,
glowing
and
cheerful
,
the
very
reverse
of
what
they
find
in
the
three
lady
sit
there
,
for
Maria
would
scarcely
raise
her
eye
from
her
book
,
and
Lady
Bertram
be
half
-
asleep
;
and
even
Mrs.
Norris
,
discompose
by
her
niece
's
ill
-
humour
,
and
have
ask
one
or
two
question
about
the
dinner
,
which
be
not
immediately
attend
to
,
seem
almost
determined
to
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
for
a
few
minute
the
brother
and
sister
be
too
eager
in
their
praise
of
the
night
and
their
remark
on
the
star
,
to
think
beyond
themselves
;
but
when
the
first
pause
come
,
Edmund
,
look
around
,
say
,
"
<EOS>
but
where
be
Fanny
?
<EOS>
be
she
go
to
bed
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
,
<EOS>
not
that
I
know
of
,
"
reply
Mrs.
Norris
;
"
she
be
here
a
moment
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
own
gentle
voice
speak
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
which
be
a
very
long
one
,
tell
them
that
she
be
on
the
sofa
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
begin
scold
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
very
foolish
trick
,
Fanny
,
to
be
idle
away
all
the
evening
upon
a
sofa
.
<EOS>
why
can
not
you
come
and
sit
here
,
and
employ
yourself
as
_
we
_
do
?
<EOS>
if
you
have
no
work
of
your
own
,
I
can
supply
you
from
the
poor
basket
.
<EOS>
there
be
all
the
new
calico
,
that
be
buy
last
week
,
not
touch
yet
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
almost
break
my
back
by
cut
it
out
.
<EOS>
You
should
learn
to
think
of
other
people
;
and
,
take
my
word
for
it
,
it
be
a
shocking
trick
for
a
young
person
to
be
always
loll
upon
a
sofa
.
"
  
<EOS>
before
half
this
be
say
,
Fanny
be
return
to
her
seat
at
the
table
,
and
have
take
up
her
work
again
;
and
Julia
,
who
be
in
high
good
-
humour
,
from
the
pleasure
of
the
day
,
do
her
the
justice
of
exclaim
,
"
I
must
say
,
madam
,
that
Fanny
be
as
little
upon
the
sofa
as
anybody
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fanny
,
"
say
Edmund
,
after
look
at
her
attentively
,
"
I
be
sure
you
have
the
headache

"
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
deny
it
,
but
say
it
be
not
very
bad
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
hardly
believe
you

he
reply
;
"
I
know
your
look
too
well

how
long
have
you
have
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
since
a
little
before
dinner

<EOS>
It
be
nothing
but
the
heat

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
go
out
in
the
heat

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
go
out
!
<EOS>
to
be
sure
she
do

say
Mrs.
Norris
:
"
would
you
have
her
stay
within
such
a
fine
day
as
this
?

not

_
all
_
out

<EOS>
even
your

hour

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

indeed

Edmund

"
add
her
ladyship
,
who
have
be
thoroughly
awaken
by
Mrs.
Norris
's
sharp
reprimand
to
Fanny
;

I
be
out
above
an
hour

<EOS>
I
sit
three
-
quarter
of
an
hour
in
the
flower

garden
,
while
Fanny
cut
the
rose
;
and
very
pleasant
it
be
,
I
assure
you
,
but
very
hot
.
<EOS>
It
be
shady
enough
in
the
alcove
,
but
I
declare
I
quite
dread
the
come
home
again

"
  
<EOS>
"
Fanny
have
be
cut
rose

have
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes

I
be
afraid
they
will
be
the
last
this
year
.
<EOS>
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
find
it
hot
enough
;
but
they
be
so
full

blow
that
one
could
not
wait
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
help
for
it
,
certainly
,
"
rejoin
Mrs.
Norris
,
in
a
rather
softened
voice
;
"
but
I
question
whether
her
headache
may
not
be
catch
_
then
_
,
sister
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
so
likely
to
give
it
as
stand
and
stoop
in
a
hot
sun
;
but
I
dare
say
it
will
be
well
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
suppose
you
let
her
have
your
aromatic
vinegar
;
I
always
forget
to
have
mine
fill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
get
it
,
"
say
Lady
Bertram
;
"
she
have
have
it
ever
since
she
come
back
from
your
house
the
second
time

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Edmund
;
"
have
she
be
walk
as
well
as
cut
rose
;
walk
across
the
hot
park
to
your
house

and
do
it
twice

madam
?
<EOS>
no
wonder
her
head
ache

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
be
talk
to
Julia
,
and
do
not
hear
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
it
would
be
too
much
for
her
,
"
say
Lady
Bertram
;
"
but
when
the
rose
be
gather
,
your
aunt
wish
to
have
them
,

then
you
know
they
must
be
take
home
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
but
be
there
rose
enough
to
oblige
her
to
go
twice
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
but
they
be
to
be
put
into
the
spare
room
to
dry
;
and
,
unluckily
,
Fanny
forget
to
lock
the
door
of
the
room

bring
away
the
key
,
so
she
be
oblige
to
go
again

Edmund
get
up
and
walk
about
the
room
,
say
,
"
<EOS>
and
could
nobody
be
employ
on
such
an
errand
but
Fanny
?
<EOS>
upon
my
word
,
madam
,
it
have
be
a
very
ill
-
manage
business
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
do
not
know
how
it
be
to
have
be
do
better
,
"
cry
Mrs.
Norris
,
unable
to
be
longer
deaf
;
"
unless
I
have
go
myself
,
indeed
;
but
I
can
not
be
in
two
place
at
once
;
and
I
be
talk
to
Mr.
Green
at
that
very
time
about
your
mother
's
dairymaid
,
by
_
<EOS>
her
_
desire
,

have
promise
John
Groom
to
write
to
Mrs.
Jefferies
about
his
son
,
and
the
poor
fellow
be
wait
for
me
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
I
think
nobody
can
justly
accuse
me
of
spare
myself
upon
any
occasion
,
but
really
I
can
not
do
everything
at
once
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
Fanny
's
just
step
down
to
my
house
for
me
 
<EOS>
it
be
not
much
above
a
quarter
of
a
mile
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
think
I
be
unreasonable
to
ask
it
.
<EOS>
how
often
do
I
pace
it
three
time
a
day
,
early
and
late
,
ay
,
and
in
all
weather
too
,
and
say
nothing
about
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
Fanny
have
half
your
strength
,
madam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
Fanny
would
be
more
regular
in
her
exercise
,
she
would
not
be
knock
up
so
soon
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
be
out
on
horseback
now
this
long
while
,
and
I
be
persuade
that
,
when
she
do
not
ride
,
she
ought
to
walk
.
<EOS>
if
she
have
be
ride
before
,
I
should
not
have
ask
it
of
her
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
it
would
rather
do
her
good
after
be
stoop
among
the
rose
;
for
there
be
nothing
so
refreshing
as
a
walk
after
a
fatigue
of
that
kind
;
and
though
the
sun
be
strong
,
it
be
not
so
very
hot
.
<EOS>
between
ourselves
,
Edmund
,
"
nod
significantly
at
his
mother
,
"
it
be
cut
the
rose
,
and
dawdle
about
in
the
flower
-
garden
,
that
do
the
mischief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
it
be
,
indeed
,
"
say
the
more
candid
Lady
Bertram
,
who
have
overhear
her
;
"
I
be
very
much
afraid
she
catch
the
headache
there
,
for
the
heat
<EOS>
be
enough
to
kill
anybody
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
much
as
I
could
bear
myself
.
<EOS>
sit
and
call
to
Pug
,
and
try
to
keep
him
from
the
flower
-
bed
,
be
almost
too
much
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Edmund
say
no
more
to
either
lady
;
but
go
quietly
to
another
table
,
on
which
the
supper
-
tray
yet
remain
,
bring
a
glass
of
madeira
to
Fanny
,
and
oblige
her
to
drink
the
great
part
.
<EOS>
She
wish
to
be
able
to
decline
it
;
but
the
tear
,
which
a
variety
of
feeling
create
,
make
it
easy
to
swallow
than
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
Vexed
as
Edmund
be
with
his
mother
and
aunt
,
he
be
still
more
angry
with
himself
.
<EOS>
His
own
forgetfulness
of
her
be
bad
than
anything
which
they
have
do
.
<EOS>
nothing
of
this
would
have
happen
have
she
be
properly
consider
;
but
she
have
be
leave
four
day
together
without
any
choice
of
companion
or
exercise
,
and
without
any
excuse
for
avoid
whatever
her
unreasonable
aunt
may
require
.
<EOS>
He
be
ashamed
to
think
that
for
four
day
together
she
have
not
have
the
power
of
ride
,
and
very
seriously
resolve
,
however
unwilling
he
must
be
to
check
a
pleasure
of
Miss
Crawford
's
,
that
it
should
never
happen
again
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
go
to
bed
with
her
heart
as
full
as
on
the
first
evening
of
her
arrival
at
the
Park
.
<EOS>
the
state
of
her
spirit
have
probably
have
its
share
in
her
indisposition
;
for
she
have
be
feel
neglect
,
and
be
struggle
against
discontent
and
envy
for
some
day
past
.
<EOS>
as
she
lean
on
the
sofa
,
to
which
she
have
retreat
that
she
may
not
be
see
,
the
pain
of
her
mind
have
be
much
beyond
that
in
her
head
;
and
the
sudden
change
which
Edmund
's
kindness
have
then
occasion
,
make
her
hardly
know
how
to
support
herself
.
    
<EOS>
Fanny
's
ride
recommence
the
very
next
day
;
and
as
it
be
a
pleasant
fresh
-
feeling
morning
,
less
hot
than
the
weather
have
lately
be
,
Edmund
trust
that
her
loss
,
both
of
health
and
pleasure
,
would
be
soon
make
good
.
<EOS>
while
she
be
go
Mr.
Rushworth
arrive
,
escort
his
mother
,
who
come
to
be
civil
and
to
shew
her
civility
especially
,
in
urge
the
execution
of
the
plan
for
visit
Sotherton
,
which
have
be
start
a
fortnight
before
,
and
which
,
in
consequence
of
her
subsequent
absence
from
home
,
have
since
lain
dormant
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
and
her
niece
be
all
well
pleased
with
its
revival
,
and
an
early
day
be
name
and
agree
to
,
provide
Mr.
Crawford
should
be
disengage
:
the
young
lady
do
not
forget
that
stipulation
,
and
though
Mrs.
Norris
would
willingly
have
answer
for
his
be
so
,
they
would
neither
authorise
the
liberty
nor
run
the
risk
;
and
at
last
,
on
a
hint
from
Miss
Bertram
,
Mr.
Rushworth
discover
that
the
proper
thing
to
be
do
be
for
him
to
walk
down
to
the
Parsonage
directly
,
and
call
on
Mr.
Crawford
,
and
inquire
whether
Wednesday
would
suit
him
or
not
.
  
<EOS>
before
his
return
Mrs.
Grant
and
Miss
Crawford
come
in
.
<EOS>
have
be
out
some
time
,
and
take
a
different
route
to
the
house
,
they
have
not
meet
him
.
<EOS>
comfortable
hope
,
however
,
be
give
that
he
would
find
Mr.
Crawford
at
home
.
<EOS>
the
Sotherton
scheme
be
mention
of
course
.
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
possible
,
indeed
,
that
anything
else
should
be
talk
of
,
for
Mrs.
Norris
be
in
high
spirit
about
it
;
and
Mrs.
Rushworth
,
a
well
-
mean
,
civil
,
prosing
,
pompous
woman
,
who
think
nothing
of
consequence
,
but
as
it
relate
to
her
own
and
her
son
's
concern
,
have
not
yet
give
over
press
Lady
Bertram
to
be
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
Lady
Bertram
constantly
decline
it
;
but
her
placid
manner
of
refusal
make
Mrs.
Rushworth
still
think
she
wish
to
come
,
till
Mrs.
Norris
's
more
numerous
word
and
louder
tone
convince
her
of
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
fatigue
would
be
too
much
for
my
sister
,
a
great
deal
too
much
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Rushworth
.
<EOS>
ten
mile
there
,
and
ten
back
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
You
must
excuse
my
sister
on
this
occasion
,
and
accept
of
our
two
dear
girl
and
myself
without
her

<EOS>
Sotherton
be
the
only
place
that
could
give
her
a
_
wish
_
to
go
so
far
,
but
it
can
not
be
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
She
will
have
a
companion
in
Fanny
Price
,
you
know

so
it
will
all
do
very
well
;

as
for
Edmund

as
he
be
not
here
to
speak
for
himself

whether

<EOS>
the
Miss

at
the

that

there

<EOS>
yes

there
be
no

you

give

pleasure

<EOS>
"
oh

<EOS>
very
glad

if
your
aunt
see
no
objection

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
be
very
ready
with
the
only
objection
which
could
remain
 
their
have
positively
assure
Mrs.
Rushworth
that
Fanny
could
not
go
,
and
the
very
strange
appearance
there
would
consequently
be
in
take
her
,
which
seem
to
her
a
difficulty
quite
impossible
to
be
get
over
.
<EOS>
It
must
have
the
strange
appearance
!
<EOS>
It
would
be
something
so
very
unceremonious
,
so
border
on
disrespect
for
Mrs.
Rushworth
,
whose
own
manner
be
such
a
pattern
of
good
-
breeding
and
attention
,
that
she
really
do
not
feel
equal
to
it
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
have
no
affection
for
Fanny
,
and
no
wish
of
procure
her
pleasure
at
any
time
;
but
her
opposition
to
Edmund
_
now
_
,
arise
more
from
partiality
for
her
own
scheme
,
because
it
_
be
_
her
own
,
than
from
anything
else
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
she
have
arrange
everything
extremely
well
,
and
that
any
alteration
must
be
for
the
bad

<EOS>
when
Edmund
,
therefore
,
tell
her
in
reply
,
as
he
do
when
she
would
give
him
the
hearing
,
that
she
nee
not
distress
herself
on
Mrs.
Rushworth
's
account
,
because
he
have
take
the
opportunity
,
as
he
walk
with
her
through
the
hall
,
of
mention
Miss
Price
as
one
who
would
probably
be
of
the
party
,
and
have
directly
receive
a
very
sufficient
invitation
for
his
cousin
,
Mrs.
Norris
be
too
much
vexed
to
submit
with
a
very
good
grace
,
and
would
only
say
,
"
very
well
,
very
well

just
as
you

settle
it

I

I

<EOS>

It

that
you
should

<EOS>

much
oblige

you

add
Julia

hastily
leave
the
room
as
she
speak
,
from
a
consciousness
that
she
ought
to
offer
to
stay
at
home
herself

"
Fanny
will
feel
quite
as
grateful
as
the
occasion

Edmund

only
reply

subject
dropt

<EOS>
Fanny
's
gratitude
,
when
she
hear
the
plan

be
,
in
fact

much
great
than
her
pleasure

<EOS>
She
feel
Edmund
's
kindness
with
all
,
and
more
than
all
,
the
sensibility
which
he
,
unsuspicious
of
her
fond
attachment
,
could
be
aware
of
;
but
that
he
should
forego
any
enjoyment
on
her
account
give
her
pain
,
and
her
own
satisfaction
in
see
Sotherton
would
be
nothing
without
him
.

the
next
meeting
of
the
two

another
alteration
in
the
plan

<EOS>
even
Edmund
be
very
thankful
for
an
arrangement
which
restore
him
to
his
share

the
party

Mrs.
Norris

it
an
excellent
plan

it
at

tongue

end

be
on
the
point

Wednesday

whose
ride

be
soon
beyond
her
knowledge
,
and
be
very
happy
in
observe
all
that

She

to
join
in
the
conversation

she
desire
it

Her
own
thought
and
reflection
be
habitually
her
good
companion

,
in
observe
the
appearance
of
the
country
,
the
bearing
of
the
road
,
the
difference
of
soil
,
the
state
of
the
harvest

the
cottage

she
find
entertainment
that
could
only
have
be
heighten
by
have
Edmund
to
speak
to
of
what
she
feel

<EOS>
that
be
the
only
point

resemblance
between
her

the
lady
who
sit
by
her

in
everything
but
a
value
for
Edmund

Miss

be
very
unlike
her

She
have
none

delicacy

she

Nature

inanimate

with
little
observation

her
attention
be
all
for
man

her
talent
for
the
light

lively

<EOS>
in
look
back
after
Edmund

however
,
when
there
be
any
stretch
of
road
behind
them
,
or
when
he
gain
on
them
in
ascend
a
considerable
hill
,
they

and
a

there

at
the

moment
from
them
both

more
than
once

<EOS>
for
the
first
seven
mile
Miss
Bertram
have
very
little
real
comfort
:
her
prospect
always
end
in
Mr.
Crawford
and
her
sister
sit
side
by
side
,
full
of
conversation
and
merriment
;
and
to
see
only
his
expressive
profile
as
he
turn
with
a
smile
to
Julia
,
or
to
catch
the
laugh
of
the
other
,
be
a
perpetual
source
of
irritation
,
which
her
own
sense
of
propriety
could
but
just
smooth
over
.
<EOS>
when
Julia
look
back
,
it
be
with
a
countenance
of
delight
,
and
whenever
she
speak
to
them
,
it
be
in
the
high
spirit
:
"
<EOS>
her
view
of
the
country
be
charming
,
she
wish
they
could
all
see
it
,
"
<EOS>
etc

<EOS>
;
but
her
only
offer
of
exchange
be
address
to
Miss
Crawford
,
as
they
gain
the
summit
of
a
long
hill
,
and
be
not
more
inviting
than
this
:
"
<EOS>
here
be
a
fine
burst
of
country
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
have
my
seat
,
but
I
dare
say
you
will
not
take
it
,
let
me
press
you
ever
so
much
;

and
Miss
Crawford
could
hardly
answer
before
they
be
move
again
at
a
good
pace

<EOS>
when
they
come
within
the
influence
of
Sotherton
association

it
be
well
for
Miss

who
may
be
say
to
have
two

She

considerable
effect

her

She
could
not
tell
Miss

that

she
could
not

she

at

there

the

dreadful

We
go
down
hill
to
it

for

all
lofty

of

anything

who
have
be
at
great
pain
to
learn
all
that
the
housekeeper
could
teach
,

be
now
almost
equally
well
qualified

the

<EOS>
on
the

she
address
herself
chiefly
to
Miss
Crawford

Fanny

but
there
be
no
comparison
in
the
willingness
of
their
attention
;
for
Miss
Crawford
,
who
have
see
score
of
great
house
,
and
care
for
none
of
them

have
only
the
appearance

civilly
listen

Fanny

to
whom
everything
be
almost
as
interesting

new

attend
with
unaffected
earnestness
to
all
that
Mrs.

could
relate
of
the

in

its
rise

grandeur
,
regal
visit

loyal
effort

delighted
to
connect
anything
with

already
know

her
imagination
with

<EOS>
the
situation
of
the

exclude
the
possibility

look
grave

shake
his

have
visit
many
more

to

employment
for
housemaid

"
now

say
Mrs.

"
we
be
come
to
the
chapel

properly
we

you

me

<EOS>
They
enter

<EOS>
Fanny
's
imagination
have
prepare
her
for
something
grander
than
a
mere
spacious
,
oblong
room
,
fit
up
for
the
purpose
of
devotion
:
with
nothing
more
striking
or
more
solemn
than
the
profusion
of
mahogany
,
and
the
crimson
velvet
cushion
appear
over
the
ledge
of
the
family
gallery
above
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
disappoint
,
"
say
she
,
in
a
low
voice
,
to
Edmund

<EOS>
"
this
be
not
my
idea

a
chapel

for
how
confine
a
purpose

compare
with
the

chapel

It

only
for
the
private
use

It

foolish

me
not

I
be
disappointed

<EOS>
Mrs.
Rushworth
begin
her
relation

<EOS>
this
chapel
be
fit
up

you
see
it

in
James
the
Second
's
time
.
<EOS>
before
that
period
,
as
I
understand
,
the
pew
be
only
wainscot
;
and
there
be
some
reason
to
think
that
the
lining
and
cushion
of
the
pulpit
and
family
seat
be
only
purple
cloth
;
but
this
be
not
quite
certain
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
handsome
chapel
,
and
be
formerly
in
constant
use
both
morning
and
evening
.
<EOS>
prayer
be
always
read
in
it
by
the
domestic
chaplain

within
the
memory
of
many
;

the
late
Mr.
Rushworth
leave
it
off
.

its
improvement

Miss

repeat
her
lesson

cluster
together

Fanny

that
the
custom

<EOS>
It
be
a
valuable
part
of
former

<EOS>
there
be
something
in
a

chaplain
so
much
in
character
with
a
great
house

with
one

idea
of
what
such

a

<EOS>
"
very
fine
indeed

Miss

It
must
do

great
deal

good
to

all

the

restraint

the
length

it

a
formidable
thing

what
nobody
like

the
good
people

foresee

these

consultation

Miss

as

the
politeness

joyfully
through

considerable
flight
of

wood

be
darkness

They
all

for

at

Miss

with
,
"
so
you

Mr.

<EOS>
this
be
rather
a
surprise
to
me

"
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
it
surprise
you
?
<EOS>
You
must
suppose
me
design
for
some
profession

may
perceive
that
I
be
neither
a
lawyer

nor
a
soldier
,
nor
a
sailor

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
true
;
but
,
in
short
,
it
have
not
occur
to
me

<EOS>
and
you
know
there
be
generally
an
uncle
or
a
grandfather
to
leave
a
fortune
to
the
second
son
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
very
praiseworthy
practice
,
"
say
Edmund
,
"

not
quite
universal

<EOS>
I
be

one

must
do
something
for
myself

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

why
be
you
to

<EOS>
I
think

the
lot

there
be
many
to
chuse

you

Never

<EOS>
man

to
distinguish
themselves
,
and
in
either
of
the
other
line
distinction
may
be

,

not

<EOS>
a
clergyman
be
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
the

conversation
have
its
gradation
,
I
hope
,
as
well
as
the

<EOS>
never

<EOS>
a
clergyman
can
not
be
high
in
state
or
fashion
.
<EOS>
He
must
not
head
mob
,
or
set
the
ton
in
dress
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
call
that
situation
nothing
which
have
the
charge
of
all
that
be
of
the
first
importance
to
mankind
,
individually
or
collectively
consider
,
temporally
and
eternally
,
which
have
the
guardianship
of
religion
and
moral
,
and
consequently
of
the
manner
which
result
from
their
influence
.
<EOS>
no
one
here
can
call
the
_
office
_
nothing
.
<EOS>
if
the
man
who
hold
it
be
so
,
it
be
by
the
neglect
of
his
duty
,
by
forego
its
just
importance
,
and
step
out
of
his
place
to
appear
what
he
ought
not
to
appear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
You
_
assign
great
consequence
to
the
clergyman
than
one
have
be
use
to
hear
give
,
or
than
I
can
quite
comprehend
.
<EOS>
one
do
not
see
much
of
this
influence

importance
in
society
,
and
how
can
it
be
acquire
where
they
be
so
seldom
see
themselves
?
<EOS>
how
can
two
sermon
a
week
,
even
suppose
them
worth
hearing
,
suppose
the
preacher
to
have
the
sense
to
prefer
Blair
's
to
his
own
,
do
all
that
you
speak
of

<EOS>
govern
the
conduct
and
fashion
the
manner
of
a
large
congregation
for
the
rest
of
the
week

scarcely
see

out

not

I
should
hope

of
the
proportion

virtue

We
do
not

city

our

morality

<EOS>
It
be
not
there
that
respectable

most
good

<EOS>
a
fine
preacher
be
follow

admire
;

it
be
not
in
fine
preaching
only
that
a
good
clergyman
will
be
useful
in
his
parish

his
neighbourhood
,
where
the
parish
and
neighbourhood
be
of
a
size
capable
of
know
his
private
character
,
and
observe
his
general
conduct

which
in
London
can
rarely
be
the
case

the

be
lose
there
in

crowd

their
parishioner

only
as
preacher

<EOS>
and
with
regard

their

public
manner

Miss
Crawford
must
not
misunderstand
me
,

suppose
I
mean
to
call
them
the
arbiter
of
good

breeding
,
the
regulator
of
refinement

the
master
of
the
ceremony
of

good

the

in

of
those
doctrine
which
it
be
their
duty
to
teach

it
will

I
believe

be
everywhere

half
half
a
mile

She
would

she

She
would
only
smile

assert

<EOS>
the
great
degree
of
rational
consistency
could
not
have
be
more
engaging

they
talk
with

satisfaction

<EOS>
at
last
it
be
agree

they
should

determine
the
dimension
of

wood
by
walk
a
little
more
about
it

They
would
go
to
one
end

in

there
be
a
straight
green
walk
along

turn

urge
her
remain
where
she

with
an
earnestness

be
leave
on

bench
to
think
with
pleasure
of
her
cousin

care

with
great
regret
that
she

<EOS>
She
watch
them
till
they
have
turn
the
corner
,

listen
till

cease

a

twenty
minute

pass
away

Fanny
be
still

of

,
without

one

She
begin
to
be
surprised
at
be
leave
so
long
,
and
to
listen
with
an
anxious
desire
of
hear
their
step
and
their
voice
again

<EOS>
She
listen
,
and
at
length
she
hear
;
she
hear
voice

foot
approach

she
have
just
satisfy
herself
that
it
be
not
those
she
want
,
when
Miss
Bertram
,
Mr.
Rushworth
,
and
Mr.

issue
from
the

path
which
she
have
trod
herself

My

how

She
tell

poor

her
cousin

how
ill
you

You
have
better
have
staid
with
us

<EOS>
then
seat
herself
with
a
gentleman
on
each
side
,
she
resume
the
conversation
which
have
engage
them
before
,
and
discuss
the
possibility
of
improvement
with
much
animation
.
<EOS>
nothing
be
fix
on
;
but
Henry
Crawford
be
full
of
idea
and
project
,
and
,
generally
speak
,
whatever
he
propose
be
immediately
approve
,
first
by
her
,
and
then
by
Mr.
Rushworth
,
whose
principal
business
seem
to
be
to
hear
the
other
,
and
who
scarcely
risk
an
original
thought
of
his
own
beyond
a
wish
that
they
have
see
his
friend
Smith
's
place
.
  
<EOS>
after
some
minute
spend
in
this
way
,
Miss
Bertram
,
observe
the
iron
gate
,
express
a
wish
of
pass
through
it
into
the
park
,
that
their
view
and
their
plan
may
be
more
comprehensive
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
very
thing
of
all
other
to
be
wish
,
it
be
the
good
,
it
be
the
only
way
of
proceed
with
any
advantage
,
in
Henry
Crawford
's
opinion
;
and
he
directly
see
a
knoll
not
half
a
mile
off
,
which
would
give
them
exactly
the
requisite
command
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
go
therefore
they
must
to
that
knoll
,
and
through
that
gate
;
but
the
gate
be
lock
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rushworth
wish
he
have
bring
the
key
;
he
have
be
very
near
think
whether
he
should
not
bring
the
key
;
he
be
determine
he
would
never
come
without
the
key
again
;
but
still
this
do
not
remove
the
present
evil
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
get
through
;
and
as
Miss
Bertram
's
inclination
for
so
do
do
by
no
means
lessen
,
it
end
in
Mr.
Rushworth
's
declare
outright
that
he
would
go
and
fetch
the
key
.
<EOS>
He
set
off
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
undoubtedly
the
good
thing
we
can
do
now
,
as
we
be
so
far
from
the
house
already
,
"
say
Mr.
Crawford
,
when
he
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
there
be
nothing
else
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
sincerely
,
do
not
you
find
the
place
altogether
bad
than
you
expect
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
,
far
otherwise
.
<EOS>
I
find
it
better
,
grander
,
more
complete
in
its
style
,
though
that
style
may
not
be
the
good
.
<EOS>
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
"
speak
rather
lower
,
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
that
_
I
_
shall
ever
see
Sotherton
again
with
so
much
pleasure
as
I
do
now
.
<EOS>
another
summer
will
hardly
improve
it
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
a
moment
's
embarrassment
the
lady
reply
,
"
You
be
too
much
a
man
of
the
world
not
to
see
with
the
eye
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
if
other
people
think
Sotherton
improve
,
I
have
no
doubt
that
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
I
be
not
quite
so
much
<EOS>
the
man
of
the
world
as
may
be
good
for
me
in
some
point
.
<EOS>
My
feeling
be
not
quite
so
evanescent
,
nor
my
memory
of
the
past
under
such
easy
dominion
as
one
find
to
be
the
case
with
man
of
the
world

"
  
<EOS>
this
be
follow
by
a
short
silence
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bertram
begin
again
.
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
enjoy
your
drive
here
very
much
this
morning

glad

well
entertained

be
we

<EOS>
yes

I
believe
we
be
;
but
I
have
not
the
least
recollection
at
what
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
believe
I
be
relate
to
her
some
ridiculous
story
of
an
old
irish
groom
of
my
uncle
's
.
<EOS>
Your
sister
love
to
laugh

<EOS>

You
think
her
more
light

hearted
than
I
be

<EOS>

more
easily
amuse

he
reply
;
"
consequently
,
you
know
,
"
smile
,
"
well
company

<EOS>
I
could
not
have
hope
to
entertain
you
with
irish
anecdote
during
a
ten
mile
'
drive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
naturally
,
I
believe
,
I
be
as
lively
as
Julia

I
have
more
to
think
of
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
,
undoubtedly
;
and
there
be
situation
in

very
high

insensibility

Your
prospect
,
however

be
too
fair

justify
want

You
have
a
very
smiling
scene
before
you

do
you
mean
literally

figuratively

<EOS>
literally
,
I
conclude
.
<EOS>
yes
,
certainly
,
the
sun
shine
,
and
the
park
look
very
cheerful
.
<EOS>
but
unluckily
that
iron
gate
,
that
ha

give
me
a
feeling
of
restraint

hardship

I
can
not

out

the
starling
say

<EOS>
"
as

with
expression

she
walk

follow
her

<EOS>
Mr.

be
so
long
fetch
this
key
!

<EOS>

for
the
world
you
would
not
get
out
without
the
key
and
without
Mr.

authority

protection
,

I
think
you
may
with
little
difficulty
pass
round
the
edge
of
the
gate
,
here
,
with
my
assistance
<EOS>
;
I
think
it
may
be
do
,
if
you
really
wish
to
be
more
at
large

could
allow
yourself
to
think
it
not
prohibit

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
prohibit
!
<EOS>
nonsense
!
<EOS>
I
certainly
can
get
out
that
way

I
will

<EOS>
Mr.

will
be
here
in
a
moment

you
know

we
shall
not

out
of

Miss

good

the

Fanny

Fanny
be
again
leave
to

with
no

pleasant

sorry

astonish
at

angry
with
Mr.

<EOS>
by
take
a
circuitous
route

,
as
it
appear
to
her
,
very
unreasonable
direction
to
the
knoll
,
they
be
soon
beyond
her
eye
;
and
for
some
minute
longer
she
remain
without
sight

sound
of
any
companion

<EOS>
She
seem
to
have
the
little
wood
all
to
herself

<EOS>
She
could
almost
have
think
that
Edmund

Miss
Crawford
have
leave
it

that
it
be
impossible
for
Edmund
to
forget
her
so
entirely

She
be
again
rouse
from
disagreeable
musing
by
sudden
footstep

somebody
be
come
at

quick
pace
down
the
principal
walk

She
expect
Mr.

who

hot

out

breath

with
a

cry
out

they
can

,
Julia
,
Mr.
Rushworth
will
be
here
in
a
moment
with
the
key

<EOS>
do
wait
for
Mr.
Rushworth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
I
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
enough
of
the
family
for
one
morning
.
<EOS>
why
,
child
,
I
have
but
this
moment
escape
from
his
horrible
mother
.
<EOS>
such
a
penance
as
I
have
be
endure
,
while
you
be
sit
here
<EOS>
so
compose
and
so
happy
!
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
as
well
,
perhaps
,
if
you
have
be
in
my
place
,
but
you
always
contrive
to
keep
out
of
these
scrape
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
most
unjust
reflection
,
but
Fanny
could
allow
for
it
,
and
let
it
pass
:
Julia
be
vex
,
and
her
temper
be
hasty
;
but
she
feel
that
it
would
not
last
,
and
therefore
,
take
no
notice
,
only
ask
her
if
she
have
not
see
Mr.
Rushworth
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
we
see
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
post
away
as
if
upon
life
and
death
,
and
could
but
just
spare
time
to
tell
us
his
errand
,
and
where
you
all
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
pity
he
should
have
so
much
trouble
for
nothing

the
mother
I
could
not
avoid
,
as
long
as
my
tiresome
aunt
be
dance
about
with
the
housekeeper
,
but
the
son
I
_
can
_
get
away
from
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
she
immediately
scramble
across
the
fence
,
and
walk
away
,
not
attend
to
Fanny
's
last
question
of
whether
she
have
see
anything
of
Miss
Crawford
and
Edmund
.
<EOS>
the
sort
of
dread
in
which
Fanny
now
sit
of
see
Mr.
Rushworth
prevent
her
thinking
<EOS>
so
much
of
their
continue
absence
,
however
,
as
she
may
have
do
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
he
have
be
very
ill
-
use
,
and
be
quite
unhappy
in
have
to
communicate
what
have
pass
.
<EOS>
He
join
her
within
five
minute
after
Julia
's
exit
;
and
though
she
make
the
good
of
the
story
,
he
be
evidently
mortify
and
displeased
in
no
common
degree
.
<EOS>
at
first
he
scarcely
say
anything
;
his
look
only
express
his
extreme
surprise
and
vexation
,
and
he
walk
to
the
gate
and
stand
there
,
without
seem
to
know
what
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
desire
me
to
stay
 
my
cousin
Maria
charge
me
to
say
that
you
would
find
them
at
that
knoll

thereabout

<EOS>
"
I
do
not

I
shall
go
any
farther

say
he
sullenly
;

I
see
nothing
of
them

by
the
time
I
get
to
the
knoll
they
may
be
go
somewhere
else

I
have
have
walk
enough

"
  
<EOS>
and
he
sit
down
with
a
most
gloomy
countenance
by
Fanny
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
sorry
,
"
say
she
;
"
it
be
very
unlucky
.
"
<EOS>
and
she
long
to
be
able
to
say
something
more
to
the
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
after
an
interval
of
silence
,
"
I
think
they
may
as
well
have
staid
for
me
,

say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Bertram
think
you
would
follow
her

"
I
should
not

to
follow

staid

<EOS>
this
could
not
be
deny
,

Fanny
be
silence
.

after
another
pause

he
go
on
 
"
Pray
,
Miss
Price
,
<EOS>
be
you
such
a
great
admirer
of
this
Mr.
Crawford
as
some
people
be
?
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
can
see
nothing
in
him

<EOS>

I
do
not

him
at
all
handsome

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Handsome
!
<EOS>
nobody
can
call
such
an
undersized
man
handsome
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
five
foot
nine
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
wonder
if
he
be
not
more
than
five
foot
eight
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
be
an
ill
-
look
fellow
.
<EOS>
in
my
opinion
,
these
crawford
be
no
addition
at
all
.
<EOS>
We
do
very
well
without
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
small
sigh
escape
Fanny
here
,
and
she
do
not
know
how
to
contradict
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
have
make
any
difficulty
about
fetch
the
key
,
there
may
have
be
some
excuse
,
but
I
go
the
very
moment
she
say
she
want
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
could
be
more
obliging
than
your
manner
,
I
be
sure
,
and
I
dare
say
you
walk
as
fast
as
you
could
;
but
still
it
be
some
distance
,
you
know
,
from
this
spot
to
the
house
,
quite
into
the
house
;
and
when
people
be
wait
,
they
be
bad
judge
of
time
,
and
every
half
minute
seem
like
five
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
get
up
and
walk
to
the
gate
again
,
and
"
wish
he
have
have
the
key
about
him
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Fanny
think
she
discern
in
his
standing
there
an
indication
of
relent
,
which
encourage
her
to
another
attempt
,
and
she
say
,
therefore
,
"
It
be
a
pity
you
should
not
join
them
.
<EOS>
They
expect
to
have
a
well
view
of
the
house
from
that
part
of
the
park
,
and
will
be
think
how
it
may
be
improve
;
and
nothing
of
that
sort
,
you
know
,
can
be
settle
without
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
find
herself
more
successful
in
send
away
than
in
retain
a
companion
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rushworth
be
work
on
.
"
<EOS>
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
if
you
really
think
I
have
better
go
:
it
would
be
foolish
to
bring
the
key
for
nothing
.
"
<EOS>
and
let
himself
out
,
he
walk
off
without
farth
ceremony
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
's
thought
be
now
all
engross
by
the
two
who
have
leave
her
so
long
ago
,
and
get
quite
impatient
,
she
resolve
to
go
in
search
of
them
.
<EOS>
She
follow
their
step
along
the
bottom
walk
,
and
have
just
turn
up
into
another
,
when
the
voice
and
the
laugh
of
Miss
Crawford
once
more
catch
her
ear
;
the
sound
approach
,
and
a
few
more
winding
bring
them
before
her
.
<EOS>
They
be
just
return
into
the
wilderness
from
the
park
,
to
which
a
sidegate
,
not
fasten
,
have
tempt
them
very
soon
after
their
leave
her
,
and
they
have
be
across
a
portion
of
the
park
into
the
very
avenue
which
Fanny
have
be
hope
the
whole
morning
to
reach
at
last
,
and
have
be
sit
down
under
one
of
the
tree
.
<EOS>
this
be
their
history
.
<EOS>
It
be
evident
that
they
have
be
spend
their
time
pleasantly
,
and
be
not
aware
of
the
length
of
their
absence
.
<EOS>
Fanny
's
good
consolation
be
in
be
assure
that
Edmund
have
wish
for
her
very
much
,
and
that
he
should
certainly
have
come
back
for
her
,
have
she
not
be
tired
already
;
but
this
be
not
quite
sufficient
to
do
away
with
the
pain
of
have
be
leave
a
whole
hour
,
when
he
have
talk
of
only
a
few
minute
,
nor
to
banish
the
sort
of
curiosity
she
feel
to
know
what
they
have
be
converse
about
all
that
time
;
and
the
result
of
the
whole
be
to
her
disappointment
and
depression
,
as
they
prepare
by
general
agreement
to
return
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
on
reach
the
bottom
of
the
step
to
the
terrace
,
Mrs.
Rushworth
and
Mrs.
Norris
present
themselves
at
the
top
,
just
ready
for
the
wilderness
,
at
the
end
of
an
hour
and
a
half
from
their
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
have
be
too
well
employ
to
move
faster
.
<EOS>
whatever
cross
-
accident
have
occur
to
intercept
the
pleasure
of
her
niece
,
she
have
find
a
morning
of
complete
enjoyment
;
for
the
housekeeper
,
after
a
great
many
courtesy
on
the
subject
of
pheasant
,
have
take
her
to
the
dairy
,
tell
her
all
about
their
cow
,
and
give
her
the
receipt
for
a
famous
cream
cheese
;
and
since
Julia
's
leave
them
they
have
be
meet
by
the
gardener
,
with
whom
she
have
make
a
most
satisfactory
acquaintance
,
for
she
have
set
him
right
as
to
his
grandson
's
illness
,
convince
him
that
it
be
an
ague
,
and
promise
him
a
charm
for
it
;
and
he
,
in
return
,
have
shew
her
all
his
choice
nursery
of
plant
,
and
actually
present
her
with
a
very
curious
speciman
of
heath
.
  
<EOS>
on
this
_
rencontre
_
they
all
return
to
the
house
together
,
there
to
lounge
away
the
time
as
they
could
with
sofa
,
and
chit
-
chat
,
and
Quarterly
Reviews
,
till
the
return
of
the
other
,
and
the
arrival
of
dinner
.
<EOS>
It
be
late
before
the
Miss
Bertrams
and
the
two
gentleman
come
in
,
and
their
ramble
do
not
appear
to
have
be
more
than
partially
agreeable
,
or
at
all
productive
of
anything
useful
with
regard
to
the
object
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
by
their
own
account
they
have
be
all
walk
after
each
other
,
and
the
junction
which
have
take
place
at
last
seem
,
to
Fanny
's
observation
,
to
have
be
as
much
too
late
for
re
-
establish
harmony
,
as
it
confessedly
have
be
for
determine
on
any
alteration
.
<EOS>
She
feel
,
as
she
look
at
Julia
and
Mr.
Rushworth
,
that
hers
be
not
the
only
dissatisfied
bosom
amongst
them
:
there
be
gloom
on
the
face
of
each
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Crawford
and
Miss
Bertram
be
much
more
gay
,
and
she
think
that
he
be
take
particular
pain
,
during
dinner
,
to
do
away
any
little
resentment
of
the
other
two
,
and
restore
general
good
-
humour
.
  
<EOS>
dinner
be
soon
follow
by
tea
and
coffee
,
a
ten
mile
'
drive
home
<EOS>
allow
no
waste
of
hour
;
and
from
the
time
of
their
sit
down
to
table
,
it
be
a
quick
succession
of
busy
nothing
till
the
carriage
come
to
the
door
,
and
Mrs.
Norris
,
have
fidget
about
,
and
obtain
a
few
pheasant
'
egg
and
a
cream
cheese
from
the
housekeeper
,
and
make
abundance
of
civil
speech
to
Mrs.
Rushworth
,
be
ready
to
lead
the
way
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
moment
Mr.
Crawford
,
approach
Julia
,
say
,
"
I
hope
I
be
not
to
lose
my
companion
,
unless
she
be
afraid
of
the
evening
air
in
so
expose
a
seat
.
<EOS>
"
the
request
have
not
be
foresee
,
but
be
very
graciously
receive
,
and
Julia
's
day
be
likely
to
end
almost
as
well
as
it
begin
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bertram
have
make
up
her
mind
to
something
different
,
and
be
a
little
disappointed
;
but
her
conviction
of
be
really
the
one
preferred
comfort
her
under
it
,
and
enable
her
to
receive
Mr.
Rushworth
's
part
attention
as
she
ought
.
<EOS>
He
be
certainly
better
pleased
to
hand
her
into
the
barouche
than
to
assist
her
in
ascend
the
box
,
and
his
complacency
seem
confirm
by
the
arrangement
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Fanny
,
this
have
be
a
fine
day
for
you
,
upon
my
word

say
Mrs.
Norris
,
as
they
drive
through
the
park
.
<EOS>
"
nothing
but
pleasure
from
begin
to
end
!
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
ought
to
be
very
much
oblige
to
your
aunt
Bertram
and
me
for
contrive
to
let
you
go
.
<EOS>
a
pretty
good
day
's
amusement
you
have
have
!
"
  
<EOS>
Maria
be
just
discontent
enough
to
say
directly
,
"
I
think
_
<EOS>
you
_
have
do
pretty
well
yourself
,
madam
.
<EOS>
Your
lap
seem
full
of
good
thing
,
and
here
be
a
basket
of
something
between
us
which
have
be
knock
my
elbow
unmercifully
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
it
be
only
a
beautiful
little
heath
,
which
that
nice
old
gardener
would
make
me
take
;
but
if
it
be
in
your
way
,
I
will
have
it
in
my
lap
directly
.
<EOS>
there
,
Fanny
,
you
shall
carry
that
parcel
for
me
;
take
great
care
of
it
:
do
not
let
it
fall
;
it
be
a
cream
cheese
,
just
like
the
excellent
one
we
have
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
nothing
would
satisfy
that
good
old
Mrs.
Whitaker
,
but
my
take
one
of
the
cheese
.
<EOS>
I
stand
out
as
long
as
I
could
,
till
the
tear
almost
come
into
her
eye
,
and
I
know
it
be
just
the
sort
that
my
sister
would
be
delight
with
.
<EOS>
that
Mrs.
Whitaker
be
a
treasure
!
<EOS>
She
be
quite
shocked
when
I
ask
her
whether
wine
be
allow
at
the
second
table
,
and
she
have
turn
away
two
housemaid
for
wear
white
gown

<EOS>
take
care
of
the
cheese
,
Fanny

<EOS>
now
I
can
manage
the
other
parcel
and
the
basket
very
well

<EOS>
"
what
else
have
you

Maria

half
-
please
that
Sotherton
should
be
so

<EOS>
"
spunge
,
my
dear

<EOS>
It
be
nothing
but
four
of
those
beautiful
pheasant
'
egg
,
which
Mrs.
Whitaker
would
quite
force
upon
me
:
she
would
not
take
a
denial
.
<EOS>
She
say
it
must
be
such
an
amusement
to
me
,
as
she
understand
I
live
quite
alone
,
to
have
a
few
live
creature
of
that
sort

and
so
to
be
sure
it
will
.
<EOS>
I
shall
get
the
dairymaid
to
set
them
under
the
first
spare
hen
,
and
if
they
come
to
good
<EOS>
I
can
have
them
move
to
my
own
house
and
borrow
a
coop
;
and
it
will
be
a
great
delight
to
me
in
my
lonely
hour
to
attend
to
them
.

and
if
I
have
good
luck
,
your
mother
shall
have
some

<EOS>
It
be
a
beautiful
evening
,
mild
and
still
,
and
the
drive
be
as
pleasant
as
the
serenity
of
Nature
could
make
it
;
but
when
Mrs.
Norris
cease
speak
,
it
be
altogether
a
silent
drive
to
those
within
.
<EOS>
Their
spirit
be
in
general
exhaust
;
and
to
determine
whether
the
day
have
afford
most
pleasure
or
pain
,
may
occupy
the
meditation
of
almost
all

<EOS>
the
day
at
Sotherton
,
with
all
its
imperfection

afford
the
Miss
Bertrams
much
more
agreeable
feeling

be
derive
from
the
letter
from
Antigua

soon

<EOS>
It
be
much
pleasanter
to
think
of
Henry
Crawford
than
of
their
father
;
and
to
think
of
their
father
in
England
again
within
a
certain
period
,
which
these
letter
oblige
them
to
do
,
be
a
most
unwelcome
exercise
.
  
<EOS>
November
be
the
black
month
fix
for
his
return
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
write
of
it
with
as
much
decision
as
experience
and
anxiety
could
authorise
.
<EOS>
His
business
be
so
nearly
conclude
as
to
justify
him
in
propose
to
take
his
passage
in
the
September
packet
,
and
he
consequently
look
forward
with
the
hope
of
be
with
his
beloved
family
again
early
in
November
.
  
<EOS>
Maria
be
more
to
be
pity
than
Julia
;
for
to
her
the
father
bring
a
husband
,
and
the
return
of
the
friend
most
solicitous
for
her
happiness
would
unite
her
to
the
lover
,
on
whom
she
have
choose
that
happiness
should
depend
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
gloomy
prospect
,
and
all
she
could
do
be
to
throw
a
mist
over
it
,
and
hope
when
the
mist
clear
away
she
should
see
something
else
.
<EOS>
It
would
hardly
be
_
early
_
in
November
,
there
be
generally
delay
,
a
bad
passage
or
_
something
_
;
that
favour
_
something
_
<EOS>
which
everybody
who
shut
their
eye
while
they
look
,
or
their
understanding
while
they
reason
,
feel
the
comfort
of
.
<EOS>
It
would
probably
be
the
middle
of
November
at
least
;
the
middle
of
November
be
three
month
off
.
<EOS>
three
month
comprise
thirteen
week
.
<EOS>
much
may
happen
in
thirteen
week
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
would
have
be
deeply
mortify
by
a
suspicion
of
half
that
his
daughter
feel
on
the
subject
of
his
return
,
and
would
hardly
have
find
consolation
in
a
knowledge
of
the
interest
it
excite
in
the
breast
of
another
young
lady
.
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
,
on
walk
up
with
her
brother
to
spend
the
evening
at
Mansfield
Park
,
hear
the
good
news
;
and
though
seem
to
have
no
concern
in
the
affair
beyond
politeness
,
and
to
have
vent
all
her
feeling
in
a
quiet
congratulation

hear
it
with
an
attention
not
so
easily
satisfied

<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
give
the
particular
of
the

after
tea

Miss

put
me
in

of
some
of
the

,
who
,
after

great
exploit

a
foreign

offer
sacrifice

there

no

Edmund

at

again
;

I

no

My

It
be
fortunate
that
your

Fanny

<EOS>
"
thank
you
for

it

more
than
I

on

the

there
be
no

I

no

<EOS>

It
be
the

say
Fanny
,
after

short
pause

as
for

in

nobody

anything
wrong
in
that
.
<EOS>
nobody
wonder
that
they
should
prefer

their

good

no

<EOS>

the

take

be
fairly
suspect
,
you
think
?
"
say
Edmund
.
<EOS>
"
to
be
justify
in
your

he
must
do
it
in
the
most
complete
uncertainty

"
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
no

for
you

would
not

to

I
must
beg
some
advantage
to
the
clergyman
from
your

argument

<EOS>
as
he
can
not

influence
by
those
feeling

you
rank
highly

temptation

to
the

sailor
in
their
choice
of
a
profession

as
heroism
,
and
noise

be
all
against
him

he
ought
to
be
less
liable

the
suspicion

want
sincerity

good
intention

choice
of
his

oh
!
no

he
be
very
sincere

an

have
the
good
intention
of
do
nothing
all
the
rest
of
his
day

eat

drink

grow
fat

<EOS>
It
be
indolence

Mr.

<EOS>
indolence

love

a
want

there
be
such
clergyman

no

I
think
they
be
not
so
common
as
to
justify
Miss
Crawford

esteem

their
general
character

<EOS>
I
suspect
that
in

comprehensive

I

)

commonplace
censure

you

It

impossible

you

where

usually
correct

<EOS>
though

I

have
not

much
of

it
be

I
dare

a
good

clever

often

selfish

who
must
have

partly
drive
out

I
do
not

your
disapprobation

upon

<EOS>
It
be
a
great
defect
of
temper
,
make
bad
by
a
very
faulty
habit
of
self
-
indulgence
;
and
to
see
your

suffer
from
it
must
be
exceedingly
painful
to
such
feeling

yours

Fanny

it
go
against
us

<EOS>
We
can
not
attempt

defend
Dr.

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
reply
Fanny
,
"
but
we
need
not
give
up
his
profession
for
all
that
;
because
,
whatever
profession
Dr.
Grant
have
choose
,
he
would
have
take
a
 
not
a
good
temper
into
it
;
and
as
he
must
,
either
in
the
navy
or
army
,
have
have
a
great
many
more
people
under
his
command
than
he
have
now
<EOS>
,
I
think
more
would
have
be
make
unhappy
by
him
as
a
sailor
or
soldier
than
as
a
clergyman
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
can
not
but
suppose
that
whatever
there
may
be
to
wish
otherwise
in
Dr.
Grant
would
have
be
in
a
great
danger
of
become
bad
in
a
more
active
and
worldly
profession
,
where
he
would
have
have
less
time
and
obligation
 
where
he
may
have
escape
that
knowledge
of
himself
,
the
_
frequency
_
,
at
least
,
of
that
knowledge
which
it
be
impossible
he
should
escape
as
he
be
now

<EOS>
a
man
 
a
sensible
man
like
Dr.
Grant
,
can
not
be
in
the
habit
of
teach
other
their
duty
every
week
,
can
not
go
to
church
twice
every
Sunday
,
and
preach
such
very
good
sermon
in
so
good
a
manner
as
he
do
,
without
be
the
well
for
it
himself
.
<EOS>
It
must
make
him
think
;
and
I
have
no
doubt
that
he
oftener
endeavour
to
restrain
himself
than
he
would
if
he
have
be
anything

a

depend
upon

for
though
he
may
preach
himself
into
a
good

humour
every
Sunday

it
will
be
bad
enough
to

Monday
morning

night

Fanny
agree

continue

<EOS>
when
I
look
out
on
such
a
night
as
this

I
feel
as
if
there
could
be
neither
wickedness
nor
sorrow
in
the
world

there
certainly
would
be
less
of
both
if
the

Nature

carry
more

absence
from
Mansfield
,
without
anything

pleasure
in

and
his

will
to
consult

it
perfectly
clear
that

his
indifference
be

He
go
for
a
fortnight
 
a
fortnight
of
such
dullness
to
the
Miss
Bertrams
as
ought
to
have
put
them
both
on
their
guard

make
even
Julia
admit
,
in
her
jealousy
of
her
sister
,
the
absolute
necessity
of
distrust
his
attention
,

wish
him
not

return
;

a
fortnight
of
sufficient
leisure
,
in
the
interval
of
shooting
and
sleep
,
to
have
convince
the

that
he

longer
away

he

before
his
absence

his
manner
be
to
each
so
animated

agreeable

to
lose
no
ground
with
either
,

just
stop
short
of
the
consistence

the
steadiness
,
the
solicitude

the
warmth
which
may
excite
general
notice

<EOS>
Fanny
be
the
only
one
of
the
party
who
find
anything
to
dislike
;
but
since
the
day
at
Sotherton
,
she
could
never
see
Mr.
Crawford
with
either
sister
without
observation
,
and
seldom
without
wonder
or
censure
;
and
have
her
confidence
in
her
own
judgment
be
equal
to
her
exercise
of
it
in
every
other
respect
,
<EOS>
have
she
be
sure
that
she
be
see
clearly
,
and
judge
candidly
<EOS>
,
she
would
probably
have
make
some
important
communication
to
her
usual
confidant
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
however
,
she
only
hazard
a
hint
,
and
the
hint
be
lose
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
rather
surprised
,
"
say
she
,
"
that
Mr.
Crawford
should
come
back
again
so
soon
,
after
be
here
so
long
before
,
full
seven
week
;
for
I
have
understand
he
be
so
very
fond
of
change
and
move
about
,
that
I
think
something
would
certainly
occur
,
when
he
be
once
go
,
to
take
him
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
He
be
use
to
much
gayer
place
than
Mansfield

"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
to
his
credit

be
Edmund
's
answer
;

and
I
dare
say
it
give
his
sister
pleasure
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
like
his
unsettled
habit

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
favourite
he
be
with
my
cousin

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

his
manner
to
woman
be
such
as
must
please

<EOS>
Mrs.
Grant
,
I
believe
,
suspect
him
of
a
preference
for
Julia
;
I
have
never
see
much
symptom
of
it
,
but
I
wish
it
may
be
so
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
fault
but
what
a
serious
attachment
would
remove
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
Miss
Bertram
be
not
engage
,
"
say
Fanny
cautiously
,
"
I
could
sometimes
almost
think
that
he
admire
her
more
than
Julia
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
which
be
,
perhaps
,
more
in
favour
of
his
like
Julia
best
,
than
you
,
Fanny
,
may
be
aware
;
for
I
believe
it
often
happen
that
a
man
,
before
he
have
quite
make
up
his
own
mind
,
will
distinguish
the
sister
or
intimate
friend
of
the
woman
he
be
really
think
of
more
than
the
woman
herself
.
<EOS>
Crawford
have
too
much
sense
to
stay
here
if
he
find
himself
in
any
danger
from
Maria
;
and
I
be
not
at
all
afraid
for
her
,
after
such
a
proof
as
she
have
give
that
her
feeling
be
not
strong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
suppose
she
must
have
be
mistake
,
and
mean
to
think
differently
in
future
;
but
with
all
that
submission
to
Edmund
could
do
,
and
all
the
help
of
the
coinciding
look
and
hint
which
she
occasionally
notice
in
some
of
the
other
,
and
which
seem
to
say
that
Julia
be
Mr.
Crawford
's
choice
,
she
know
not
always
what
to
think
.
<EOS>
She
be
privy
,
one
evening
,
to
the
hope
of
her
aunt
Norris
on
the
subject
,
as
well
as
to
her
feeling
,
and
the
feeling
of
Mrs.
Rushworth
,
on
a
point
of
some
similarity
,
and
could
not
help
wonder
as
she
listen
;
and
glad
would
she
have
be
not
to
be
oblige
to
listen
,
for
it
be
while
all
the
other
young
people
be
dance
,
and
she
sit
,
most
unwillingly
,
among
the
chaperon
at
the
fire
,
long
for
the
re
-
entrance
of
her
eld
cousin
,
on
whom
all
her
own
hope
of
a
partner
then
depend
.
<EOS>
It
be
Fanny
's
first
ball
,
though
without
the
preparation
or
splendour
of
many
a
young
lady
's
first
ball
,
be
the
thought
only
of
the
afternoon
,
build
on
the
late
acquisition
of
a
violin
player
in
the
servant
'
hall
,
and
the
possibility
of
raise
five
couple
with
the
help
of
Mrs.
Grant
and
a
new
intimate
friend
of
Mr.
Bertram
's
just
arrive
on
a
visit
.
<EOS>
It
have
,
however
,
be
a
very
happy
one
to
Fanny
through
four
dance
,
and
she
be
quite
grieve
to
be
lose
even
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
<EOS>
while
wait
and
wish
,
look
now
at
the
dancer

now
at

this
dialogue

force
on

"
I

"
yes

reply
the
other

with
a
stately
simper
,
"
there
will
be
some
satisfaction
in
look
on
_
now

I
think
it
be
rather
a
pity

should
have
be
oblige
to

excuse
comply

my

not

<EOS>

I
dare
say
he
do

madam

<EOS>
Mr.

be
never
remiss

dear
Maria
have
such
a
strict

so
much
of

true
delicacy

one
seldom
meet

nowadays

Mrs.
Rushworth

particularity

<EOS>
dear
madam

only
look
at
her
face
at
this
moment

how
different
from
what
it

the
two
last
dance
!

<EOS>
Miss
Bertram
do
indeed
look
happy

her
eye
be
sparkle
with
pleasure

she
be
speak
with
great
animation

for
Julia

her

Mr.

close

they
be
all
in
a
cluster
together

<EOS>
how
she
have
look
before

Fanny
could
not
recollect
,
for
she
have
be
dance

Edmund
herself

have
not

about
her

<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
continue
,
"
It
be
quite
delightful

to
see
young

well

four

<EOS>
Fanny
could
listen
no
farther
.
<EOS>
listening
and
wonder
be
all
suspend
for
a
time
,
for
Mr.
Bertram
be
in
the
room
again
;
and
though
feeling
it
would
be
a
great
honour
to
be
ask
by
him
,
she
think
it
must
happen
.
<EOS>
He
come
towards
their
little
circle
;
but
instead
of
ask
her
to
dance
,
draw
a
chair
near
her
,
and
give
her
an
account
of
the
present
state
of
a
sick
horse
,
and
the
opinion
of
the
groom
,
from
whom
he
have
just
part
.
<EOS>
Fanny
find
that
it
be
not
to
be
,
and
in
the
modesty
of
her
nature
immediately
feel
that
she
have
be
unreasonable
in
expect
it
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
tell
of
his
horse
,
he
take
a
newspaper
from
the
table
,
and
look
over
it
,
say
in
a
languid
way
,
"
if
you
want
to
dance
,
Fanny
,
I
will
stand
up
with
you
.
"
<EOS>
with
more
than
equal
civility
the
offer
be
decline
;
she
do
not
wish
to
dance

<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
of
it
,
"
say
he
,
in
a
much
brisker
tone
,
and
throw
down
the
newspaper
again
,
"
for
I
be
tired
to
death

I
only
wonder
how
the
good
people
can
keep
it
up
so
long

I
fancy

if
you
look
at
them
you
may
see
they
be
so
many
couple
of
lover
 
all

Yates
and
Mrs.
<EOS>
Grant
 
and
,
between
ourselves
,
she
,
poor
woman

must
want
a
lover
as
much
as
any
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
a
desperate
dull
life
<EOS>
her
must
be
with
the
doctor

make
a
sly
face

he
speak
towards
the
chair
of
the
latter

who
prove
,
however
,
to
be
close
at
his
elbow
,
make
so
instantaneous
a
change
of
expression
and
subject
necessary

Fanny
,
in

of
everything

could
hardly
help
laugh
at
.
<EOS>
"
a
strange
business
this
in
America

Dr.
Grant

what
be
your
opinion

no

you

<EOS>
then
leave
her
seat

come
to
him
to
enforce
the
proposal

add
in
a
whisper

Your

it

time

sit
down
herself

of
her
fringe

you

<EOS>

I
should
be
most
happy

reply
he
aloud
,
and
jump
up
with
alacrity

"
it
would
give
me
the
great
pleasure

off
very
willingly

it
be
impossible
for
her
to
feel
much
gratitude
towards
her

he

do

want

me

<EOS>
the
Honourable
John
Yates
,
this
new
friend
,
have
not
much
to
recommend
him
beyond
habit
of
fashion
and
expense
,
and
be
the
young
son
of
a
lord
with
a
tolerable
independence
;
and
Sir
Thomas
would
probably
have
think
his
introduction
at
Mansfield
by
no
mean
desirable
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bertram
's
acquaintance
with
him
have
begin
at
Weymouth
,
where
they
have
spend
ten
day
together
in
the
same
society
,
and
the
friendship
,
if
friendship
it
may
be
call
,
have
be
prove
and
perfect
by
Mr.
Yates
's
be
invite
to
take
Mansfield
in
his
way
,
whenever
he
could
,
and
by
his
promising
to
come
;
and
he
do
come
rather
earlier
than
have
be
expect
,
in
consequence
of
the
sudden
breaking
-
up
of
a
large
party
assemble
for
gaiety
at
the
house
of
another
friend
,
which
he
have
leave
Weymouth
to
join
.
<EOS>
He
come
on
the
wing
of
disappointment
,
and
with
his
head
full
of
acting
,
for
it
have
be
a
theatrical
party
;
and
the
play
in
which
he
have
bear
a
part
be
within
two
day
of
representation
,
when
the
sudden
death
of
one
of
the
near
connexion
of
the
family
have
destroy
the
scheme
and
disperse
the
performer
.
<EOS>
to
be
so
near
happiness
,
so
near
fame
,
so
near
the
long
paragraph
in
praise
of
the
private
theatrical
at
Ecclesford
,
the
seat
of
the
Right
Hon
.
<EOS>
Lord
Ravenshaw
,
in
Cornwall
,
which
would
of
course
have
immortalise
the
whole
party
for
at
least
a
twelvemonth
!
<EOS>
and
be
so
near
,
to
lose
it
all
,
be
an
injury
to
be
keenly
feel
,
and
Mr.
Yates
could
talk
of
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
Ecclesford
and
its
theatre
,
with
its
arrangement
and
dress
,
rehearsal
and
joke
,
be
his
never
-
fail
subject
,
and
to
boast
of
the
past
his
only
consolation
.
  
<EOS>
happily
for
him
,
a
love
of
the
theatre
be
so
general
,
an
itch
for
act
so
strong
among
young
people
,
that
he
could
hardly
out
-
talk
the
interest
of
his
hearer
.
<EOS>
from
the
first
casting
of
the
part
to
the
epilogue
it
be
all
bewitch
,
and
there
be
few
who
do
not
wish
to
have
be
a
party
concern
,
or
would
have
hesitate
to
try
their
skill
.
<EOS>
the
play
have
be
lover
'
vow
,
and
Mr.
Yates
be
to
have
be
Count
Cassel

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
trifle
part
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
not
at
all
to
my
taste
,
and
such
a
one
as
I
certainly
would
not
accept
again
;
but
I
be
determined
to
make
no
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Lord
Ravenshaw
and
the
duke
have
appropriate
the
only
two
character
worth
play
before
I
reach
Ecclesford
;
and
though
Lord
Ravenshaw
offer
to
resign
his
to
me
,
it
be
impossible
to
take
it
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
for
_
him
_
that
he
should
have
<EOS>
so
mistake
his
power
<EOS>
,
for
he
be
no
more
equal
to
the
Baron
 
a
little
man
with
a
weak
voice
,
always
hoarse
after
the
first
ten
minute
.
<EOS>
It
must
have
injure
the
piece
materially
;
but
_
I
_
be
resolve
to
make
no
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Sir
Henry
think
the
duke
not
equal
to
Frederick
,
but
that
be
because
Sir
Henry
want
the
part
himself
;
whereas
it
be
certainly
in
the
good
hand
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
to
see
Sir
Henry
such
a
stick
.
<EOS>
luckily
the
strength
of
the
piece
do
not
depend
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Our
Agatha
be
inimitable
,
and
the
duke
be
think
very
great
by
many
.
<EOS>
and
upon
the
whole
,
it
would
certainly
have
go
off
wonderfully
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
hard
case
,
upon
my
word
"
;
and
,
"
I
do
think
you
be
very
much
to
be
pity
,

be
the
kind
response
of
listen
sympathy

<EOS>
"
It
be
not
worth
complain
about
;
but
to
be
sure
the
poor
old
dowager
could
not
have
die
at
a
bad
time
;
and
it
be
impossible
to
help
wish
that
the
news
could
have
be
suppress
for
just
the
three
day
we
want
.
<EOS>
It
be
but
three
day
;
and
be
only
a
grandmother
,
and
all
happen
two
hundred
mile
off
,
I
think
there
would
have
be
no
great
harm
,
and
it
be
suggest
,
I
know
;
but
Lord
Ravenshaw
,
who
I
suppose
be
one
of
the
most
correct
man
in
England
,
would
not
hear
of
it

the
jointure
may
comfort
_
him

,
between

he
begin
to
tremble
for
his
credit

his

be
not

to
withdraw
;

to
make

Yates
<EOS>
,
I
think
we
must
raise
a
little
theatre
at
Mansfield
,

ask
you
to

our

.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
,
though
the
thought
of
the
moment
,
do
not
end
with
the
moment
;
for
the
inclination
to
act
be
awaken
,
and
in
no
one
more
strongly
than
in
him
who
be
now
master
of
the
house
;
and
who
,
have
so
much
leisure
as
to
make
almost
any
novelty
a
certain
good
,
have
likewise
such
a
degree
of
lively
talent
and
comic
taste
,
as
be
exactly
adapt
to
the
novelty
of
act
.
<EOS>
the
thought
return
again
and
again
.
<EOS>
"
oh
for
the
Ecclesford
theatre
and
scenery
to
try
something
with
.
<EOS>
"
each
sister
could
echo
the
wish
;
and
Henry
Crawford
,
to
whom
,
in
all
the
riot
of
his
gratification
it
be
yet
an
untasted
pleasure
,
be
quite
alive
at
the
idea

<EOS>
"
I
really
believe
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
could
be
fool
enough
at
this
moment
to
undertake
any
character
that
ever
be

,
from
Shylock
or
Richard
III
down
to
the
singe
hero
of
a
farce
in
his
scarlet
coat
and
cock
hat

<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
I
could

anything

as
if
I
could
rant

storm

caper

do
something

half
a

only
amuse
ourselves

room

house
may
suffice

<EOS>
"
We
must
have
a
curtain
,

say
Tom
Bertram
;
"
a
few
yard
of
green
baize
for

unabated
eagerness

inclination
increase
by
the
discussion

a
knowledge
of
the
inclination

the
rest

though
nothing
be
settle
but
that
Tom
Bertram
would
prefer
a
comedy
,

his
sister

Henry
Crawford
a
tragedy
,

that
nothing
in
the

could
be
easy

to
find
a
piece

would
please
them

resolution

as
to
make

I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
what
be
there
to
surprise
you
in
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
would
be
very
wrong
.
<EOS>
in
a
_
general
_
light
,
private
theatrical
be
open
to
some
objection
,
but
as
_
we
_
be
circumstance
,
I
must
think
it
would
be
highly
injudicious
,
and
more
than
injudicious
to
attempt
anything
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
It
would
shew
great
want
of
feeling
on
my
father
's
account
,
absent
as
he
be
,
and
in
some
degree
of
constant
danger
;
and
it
would
be
imprudent
,
I
think
,
with
regard
to
Maria
,
whose
situation
be
a
very
delicate
one
,
consider
everything
,
extremely
delicate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
take
up
a
thing
so
seriously
!
<EOS>
as
if
we
be
go
to
act
three
time
a
week
till
my
father
's
return
,
and
invite
all
the
country
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
to
be
a
display
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
We
mean
nothing
but
a
little
amusement
among
ourselves
,
just
to
vary
the
scene
,
and
exercise
our
power
in
something
new
.
<EOS>
We
want
no
audience
,
no
publicity
.
<EOS>
We
may
be
trust
,
I
think
,
in
chuse
some
play
most
perfectly
unexceptionable
;
and
I
can
conceive
no
great
harm
or
danger
to
any
of
us
in
converse
in
the
elegant
write
language
of
some
respectable
author
than
in
chatter
in
word
of
our
own
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
fear
and
no
scruple
.
<EOS>
and
as
to
my
father
's
be
absent
,
it
be
so
far
from
an
objection
,
that
I
consider
it
rather
as
a
motive
;
for
the
expectation
of
his
return
must
be
a
very
anxious
period
to
my
mother
;
and
if
we
can
be
the
mean
of
amuse
that
anxiety
,
and
keep
up
her
spirit
for
the
next
few
week
,
I
shall
think
our
time
very
well
spend
,
and
so
,
I
be
sure
<EOS>
,
will
he
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
_
very
_
anxious
period
for
her

I

nobody
be

<EOS>
I
be

he

it

You
must

yourself

<EOS>
My

us

as

,
to
speak
well

he
would
never
wish
his

up
daughter

His

the

Edmund

I
must
hope
it
will
be
in
a
very
small

quiet
way

and
I
think
a

<EOS>
It

I

quite

an

careful
of
his
house
as
you
can
have
;

as
to
such
alteration
as
I
be
suggest
just
now
,
such
as
move
a

unlock

even
as
use
the
billiard

room

the
space

without

you
may
just

well
suppose
he
would
object
to

more
in

less
in

absolute
nonsense
!

"
  
<EOS>

the
innovation

if
not

will
be
wrong

an
expense

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
the
expense
of
such
an
undertaking
would
be
prodigious
!
<EOS>
perhaps
it
may
cost
a
whole
twenty
pound
.
<EOS>
something
of
a
theatre
we
must
have
undoubtedly
,
but
it
will
be
on
the
simple
plan
:
a
green
curtain
and
a
little
carpenter
's
work
,
and
that
be
all
;
and
as
the
carpenter
's
work
may
be
all
do
at
home
by
Christopher
Jackson
himself
,
it
will
be
too
absurd
to
talk
of
expense
;
and
as
long
as
Jackson
be
employ
,
everything
will
be
right
with
Sir
Thomas

<EOS>
do
not

yourself

Their

there
could

in
what
have

in
so
many
respectable
family

by
so
many
woman
of

first
consideration
;

it
must
be
scrupulousness
run
mad
that
could
see
anything
to
censure
in
a
plan
like
theirs
,
comprehend
only
brother

intimate

which
would
never

themselves

Julia

Maria
evidently
consider

oblige

carry

very
little

Fanny
seem
nearer

right
than
Edmund

<EOS>
the
business
of
find
a
play
that
would
suit
everybody
prove
to
be
no
trifle
;

the
carpenter
have
receive
his

fully
evident

work

while
a
play

still

<EOS>
other
preparation

also
in

<EOS>
an
enormous
roll
of
green
baize
have
arrive
from
Northampton
,

be
cut
out
by
Mrs.
Norris
(
with
a
saving
by
her
good
management
of
full
three
-
quarter
of
a
yard
)
,
and
be
actually
form
into
a
curtain
by
the
housemaid

and
still
the
play
be
want
;
and
as
two
or
three
day
pass
away
in

manner

Edmund
begin
almost
to
hope

ever

there

so
many
thing

so
many
people
to
be
pleased

so
many
good
character
require
,
and
,
above
all
,
such
a
need
that
the
play
should
be
at
once
both
tragedy
and
comedy
,
that
there
do
seem
as
little
chance
of
a
decision
as
anything
pursue
by
youth
and
zeal
could
hold
out
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
tragic
side
be
the
Miss
Bertrams
,
Henry
Crawford
,
and
Mr.
Yates
;
on
the
comic
,
Tom
Bertram
,
not
_
quite

alone

because
it
be
evident
that
Mary
Crawford
's
wish
,
though
politely
keep
back
,
incline
the
same
way
:
but
his
determinateness
and
his
power
seem
to
make
ally
unnecessary
;
and
,
independent
of
this
great
irreconcilable
difference
,
they
want
a
piece
contain
very
few
character
in
the
whole
,
but
every
character
first
-
rate
,
and
three
principal
woman
.
<EOS>
all
the
good
play
be
run
over
in
vain

<EOS>
neither
Hamlet
,

Macbeth
,
nor
Othello
,
nor
Douglas
,
nor
the
Gamester

anything
that
could
satisfy
even
the
tragedians

the
Rivals
,
the
School
for
Scandal
,
Wheel
of
Fortune
,
Heir
at
Law
,
and
a
long
et
cetera

be
successively
dismiss
with
yet
warm
objection
.
<EOS>
no
piece
could
be
propose
that
do
not
supply
somebody
with
a
difficulty
,
and
on
one
side
or
the
other
it
be
a
continual
repetition

doubt
only
whether

Lord
Duberley

Dr.
Pangloss
for
himself

very
earnestly
,

very
unsuccessfully
,
try
to
persuade
the
other
that
there
be
some
fine
tragic
part
in
the
rest
of
the
dramatis
personae

<EOS>
the
pause
which
follow
this
fruitless
effort
be
end
by
the

speaker

who
,
take
up
one
of
the

here

be
the

grow
weary
of
indecision

the
first
idea
with
everybody
be
,
that
nothing

so
likely
to
suit

all

Mr.

be

pleased

he

longing
to
do
the
Baron
at
Ecclesford

have
grudge
every
rant
of
Lord
Ravenshaw

be
force
to
re

rant
it
all
in

<EOS>
the
storm
through
Baron
Wildenheim

the
height
of

advantage

justice

he
do

good

in

he
profess
an

that

Henry
Crawford
be

take
either

whichever
Mr.

<EOS>
Mr.

useful

that
she

short
silence

<EOS>
each
sister
look
anxious
;
for
each
feel
the
good
claim
to
Agatha

be
hope
to
have
it
press
on
her
by
the
rest

<EOS>
Henry
Crawford

who
meanwhile
have
take
up
the
play

with
seem
carelessness

turn
over
the

soon
settle
the
business

I

entreat

he

not

I
could
not

your

up

the
many

we
have
have
together
would
infallibly
come
across
me

Frederick

would
be
oblige
to
run
away
.
"
  
<EOS>
pleasantly
,
courteously
,
it
be
speak
;
but
the
manner
be
lose
in
the
matter
to
Julia
's
feeling
.
<EOS>
She
see
a
glance
at
Maria
which
confirm
the
injury
to
herself
:
it
be
a
scheme
,
a
trick
;
she
be
slight
,
Maria
be
prefer
;
the
smile
of
triumph
which
Maria
be
try
to
suppress
shew
how
well
it
be
understand
;
and
before
Julia
could
command
herself
enough
to
speak
,
her
brother
give
his
weight
against
her
too
,
by
say
,
"
<EOS>
oh
yes
!
<EOS>
Maria
must
be
Agatha

<EOS>
Maria
will
be
the
good
Agatha

<EOS>
though
Julia
fancy
she
prefer
tragedy
,
I
would
not
trust
her
in
it

<EOS>
there
be
nothing
of
tragedy
about
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
the
look
of
it

<EOS>
Her
feature
be
not
tragic
feature
,
and
she
walk
too
quick
,
and
speak
too
quick
,
and
would
not
keep
her
countenance
.
<EOS>
She
have
better
do
the
old
countrywoman
:
the
Cottager
's
wife
;
you
have
,
indeed
,
Julia
.
<EOS>
Cottager
's
wife
be
a
very
pretty
part
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
the
old
lady
relieve
the
high

benevolence
of
her
husband
with
a
good
deal
of
spirit

You
shall
be
Cottager

<EOS>
"
Cottager

cry
Mr.
Yates

"
what
be
you
talk
of
?
<EOS>
the
most
trivial
,
paltry
,
insignificant
part
;
the
mere
commonplace
;
not
a
tolerable
speech
in
the
whole
.
<EOS>
Your
sister
do
that
!
<EOS>
It
be
an
insult
to
propose
it

<EOS>
at
Ecclesford
the
governess
be
to
have
do
it

We
all
agree
that
it
could
not

offer
to
anybody
else

<EOS>
a
little
more
justice
,
Mr.
Manager
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
deserve
the
office
,
if
you
can
not
appreciate
the
talent
of
your
company
a
little
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
as
to
_
that
_
,
my
good
friend
,
till
I
and
my
company
have
really
act
there
must
be
some
guesswork
;
but
I
mean
no
disparagement
to
Julia
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
have
two
Agathas
,
and
we
must
have
one
Cottager
's
wife
;
and
I
be
sure
I
set
her
the
example
of
moderation
myself
in
be
satisfied
with
the
old
Butler
.
<EOS>
if
the
part
be
trifle
she
will
have
more
credit
in
make
something
of
it
;
and
if
she
be
so
desperately
bent
against
everything
humorous
,
let
her
take
Cottager
's
speech
instead
of
Cottager
's
wife
's
,
and
so
change
the
part
all
through
;
_
he
_
be
solemn
and
pathetic
enough
,
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
It
could
make
no
difference
in
the
play
,
and
as
for
Cottager
himself
,
when
he
have
get
his
wife
's
speech
,
_
I
_
would
undertake
him
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
with
all
your
partiality
for
Cottager
's
wife
,
"
say
Henry
Crawford
,
"
it
will
be
impossible
to
make
anything
of
it
fit
for
your
sister

we
must
not
suffer
her
good
-
nature
to
be
impose
on

We
must

her
to

her
own
complaisance

Her
talent
will
be
want
in
Amelia

<EOS>
Amelia
be
a
character
more
difficult
to
be
well
represent
than
even
Agatha
.
<EOS>
I
consider
Amelia
be
the
most
difficult
character
in
the
whole
piece
.
<EOS>
It
require
great
power
,
great
nicety
,
to
give
her
playfulness
and
simplicity
without
extravagance
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
good
actress
fail
in
the
part

<EOS>
simplicity
,
indeed
,
be
beyond
the
reach
of
almost
every
actress

profession

<EOS>
It
require
a
delicacy
of
feeling

they
have
not

It

it

her

no

waver
;

He
be

perhaps
,

at
treacherous
play

look
suspiciously
at

countenance

to
decide

Maria
look

Julia
well
know

on

ground
Maria
could
not

happy

at

expense

<EOS>
with
hasty
indignation

therefore
,
and
a
tremulous
voice

she
say
to
him

she
walk
hastily
out

leave
awkward

exciting
small
compassion

an
eagerness
which
be
suspend
only
by
interval
of
astonishment
,
that
it
could
be
choose
in
the
present
instance
,
that
it
could
be
propose
and
accept
in
a
private
theatre
!
<EOS>
Agatha
and
Amelia
appear
to
her
in
their
different
way
so
totally
improper
for
home
representation
 
<EOS>
the
situation
of
one
,
and
the
language
of
the
other
,
so
unfit
to
be
express
by
any
woman
of
modesty
,
that
she
could
hardly
suppose
her
cousin
could
be
aware
of
what
they
be
engage
in
;
and
long
to
have
them
rouse
as
soon
as
possible
by
the
remonstrance
which
Edmund
would
certainly
make
.
    
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
accept
the
part
very
readily
;
and
soon
after
Miss
Bertram
's
return
from
the
Parsonage
,
Mr.
Rushworth
arrive
,
and
another
character
be
consequently
cast
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
offer
of
Count
Cassel
and
Anhalt
,
and
at
first
do
not
know
which
to
chuse
,
and
want
Miss
Bertram
to
direct
him
;
but
upon
be
make
to
understand
the
different
style
of
the
character
,
and
which
be
which
,
and
recollect
that
he
have
once
see
the
play
in
London
,
and
have
think
Anhalt
a
very
stupid
fellow
,
he
soon
decide
for
the
Count
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bertram
approve
the
decision
,
for
the
less
he
have
to
learn
the
well
;
and
though
she
could
not
sympathise
in
his
wish
that
the
Count
and
Agatha
may
be
to
act
together
,
nor
wait
very
patiently
while
he
be
slowly
turn
over
the
leave
with
the
hope
of
still
discover
such
a
scene
,
she
very
kindly
take
his
part
in
hand
,
and
curtail
every
speech
that
admit
be
shorten
;
besides
point
out
the
necessity
of
his
be
very
much
dressed
,
and
chuse
his
colour
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rushworth
like
the
idea
of
his
finery
very
well
,
though
affect
to
despise
it
;
and
be
too
much
engage
with
what
his
own
appearance
would
be
to
think
of
the
other
,
or
draw
any
of
those
conclusion
,
or
feel
any
of
that
displeasure
which
Maria
have
be
half
prepared
for
.
  
<EOS>
thus
much
be
settle
before
Edmund
,
who
have
be
out
all
the
morning
,
know
anything
of
the
matter
;
but
when
he
enter
the
drawing
-
room
before
dinner
,
the
buzz
of
discussion
be
high
between
Tom
,
Maria
,
and
Mr.
Yates
;
and
Mr.
Rushworth
step
forward
with
great
alacrity
to
tell
him
the
agreeable
news
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
get
a
play
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
to
be
lover
'
vow
;
and
I
be
to
be
Count
Cassel
,
and
be
to
come
in
first
with
a
blue
dress
and
a
pink
satin
cloak
,
and
afterwards
be
to
have
another
fine
fancy
suit
,
by
way
of
a
shooting
-
dress
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
I
shall
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
's
eye
follow
Edmund
,
and
her
heart
beat
for
him
as
she
hear
this
speech
,
and
see
his
look
,
and
feel
what
his
sensation
must
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
lover
'
vow
!
"
<EOS>
in
a
tone
of
the
great
amazement
,
be
his
only
reply
to
Mr.
Rushworth
,
and
he
turn
towards
his
brother
and
sister
as
if
hardly
doubt
a
contradiction
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
cry
Mr.
Yates
.
<EOS>
"
after
all
our
debating
and
difficulty
,
we
find
there
be
nothing
that
will
suit
us
altogether
so
well
,
nothing
so
unexceptionable
,
as
Lovers
'
vow
.
<EOS>
the
wonder
be
that
it
should
not
have
be
think
of
before
.
<EOS>
My
stupidity
be
abominable
,
for
here
we
have
all
the
advantage
of
what
I
see
at
Ecclesford
;
and
it
be
so
useful
to
have
anything
of
a
model
!
<EOS>
We
have
cast
almost
every
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
what
do
you
do
for
woman
?
"
say
Edmund
gravely
,
and
look
at
Maria
.
  
<EOS>
Maria
blush
in
spite
of
herself
as
she
answer
,
"
I
take
the
part
which
Lady
Ravenshaw
be
to
have
do
,
and
"
(
with
a
bold
eye
)
<EOS>
"
Miss
Crawford
be
to
be
Amelia

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
have
think
it
the
sort
of
play
to
be
so
easily
fill
up
,
with
_
us

,
"
reply
Edmund
,
turn
away
to
the
fire
,
where
sit
his
mother
,
aunt
,
and
Fanny
,
and
seat
himself
with
a
look
of
great
vexation
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rushworth
follow
him
to
say
,
"
I
come
in
three
time
,
and
have
two
-
and
-
forty
speech
.
<EOS>
that
be
something
,
be
not
it

<EOS>
but
I
do
not
much
like
the
idea
of
be
so
fine
.
<EOS>
I
shall
hardly
know
myself
in
a
blue
dress

a
pink
satin
cloak

<EOS>
Edmund
could
not
answer
him
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
Mr.
Bertram
be
call
out
of
the
room
to
satisfy
some
doubt
of
the
carpenter
;
and
be
accompany
by
Mr.
Yates
,
and
follow
soon
afterwards
by
Mr.
Rushworth
,
Edmund
almost
immediately
take
the
opportunity
of
say
,
"
I
can
not
,
before
Mr.
Yates
,
speak
what
I
feel
as
to
this
play
,
without
reflect
on
his
friend
at
Ecclesford
;
but
I
must
now
,
my
dear
Maria
,
tell
_
you
_
,
that
I
think
it
exceedingly
unfit
for
private
representation
,
and
that
I
hope
you
will
give
it
up
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
but
suppose
you
_
<EOS>
will
_
<EOS>
when
you
have
read
it
carefully
over
.
<EOS>
read
only
the
first
act
aloud
to
either
your
mother
or
aunt
,
and
see
how
you
can
approve
it
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
be
necessary
to
send
you
to
your
_
father
's
_
judgment
,
I
be
convinced
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
see
thing
very
differently
,
"
cry
Maria
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
perfectly
acquaint
with
the
play
,
I
assure
you
;
and
with
a
very
few
omission
,
and
so
forth
,
which
will
be
make
,
of
course
,
I
can
see
nothing
objectionable
in
it
;
and
_
I
_
be
not
the
_
<EOS>
only
_
young
woman
you
find
who
think
it
very
fit
for
private
representation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
for
it
,
"
be
his
answer
;
"
but
in
this
matter
it
be
_
<EOS>
you
_
who
be
to
lead
.
<EOS>
_
You
_
must
set
the
example
.
<EOS>
if
other
have
blunder
,
it
be
your
place
to
put
them
right
,
and
shew
them
what
true
delicacy
be
.
<EOS>
in
all
point
of
decorum
_
your
_
conduct
must
be
law
to
the

party

"
  
<EOS>
this
picture
of
her
consequence
have
some
effect
,
for
no
one
love
better
to
lead
than
Maria
;
and
with
far
more
good
-
humour
<EOS>
she
answer
,
"
I
be
much
oblige
to
you
,
Edmund
;
you
mean
very
well
,
I
be
sure
:
<EOS>
but
I
still
think
you
see
thing
too
strongly
;
and
I
really
can
not
undertake
to
harangue
all
the
rest
upon
a
subject
of
this
kind
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
there
_
would
be
the
great
indecorum
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
you
imagine
that
I
could
have
such
an
idea
in
my
head
?
<EOS>
no
;
let
your
conduct
be
the
only
harangue
.
<EOS>
say
that
,
on
examine
the
part
,
you
feel
yourself
unequal
to
it
;
that
you
find
it
require
more
exertion
and
confidence
than
you
can
be
suppose
to
have
.
<EOS>
say
this
with
firmness
,
and
it
will
be
quite
enough
.
<EOS>
all
who
can
distinguish
will
understand
your
motive
.
<EOS>
the
play
will
be
give
up
,
and
your
delicacy
honour
as
it
ought

<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
act
anything
improper

Lady
Bertram

Sir
Thomas
would
not

it

the
part

it

your

oh
!

she
may
think
the
difference

the
difference

situation
 
that
_
<EOS>
she
_
nee
not
be
so
scrupulous
as
_
<EOS>
I

may
feel
necessary

<EOS>
I
be
sure
she
would
argue
so

<EOS>
no
;
you
must
excuse
me
;
I
can
not
retract
my
consent
;
it
be
too
far
settle
,
everybody
would
be
so
disappointed
<EOS>
,
Tom
would
be
quite
angry
;
and
if
we
be
so
very
nice
,
we
shall
never
act
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
just
go
to
say
the
very
same
thing
,
"
say
Mrs.
Norris
.
<EOS>
"
if
every
play
be
to
be
object
to
,
you
will
act
nothing
,
and
the
preparation
will
be
all
so
much
money
throw
away
,
and
I
be
sure
_
that
_
would
be
a
discredit
to
us
all
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
the
play
;
but
,
as
Maria
say
,
if
there
be
anything
a
little
too
warm
(
and
it
be
so
with
most
of
them
)
<EOS>
it
can
be
easily
leave
out
.
<EOS>
We
must
not
be
over
-
precise
,
Edmund
.
<EOS>
as
Mr.
Rushworth
be
to
act
too
,
there
can
be
no
harm
.
<EOS>
I
only
wish
Tom
have
know
his
own
mind
when
the
carpenter
begin
,
<EOS>
for
there
be
the
loss
of
half
a
day
's
work
about
those
side
-
door
.
<EOS>
the
curtain
will
be
a
good
job
,
however
.
<EOS>
the
maid
do
their
work
very
well
,
and
I
think
we
shall
be
able
to
send
back
some
dozen
of
the
ring
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
occasion
to
put
them
so
very
close
together
.
<EOS>
I
_
be
_
of
some
use
,
I
hope
,
in
prevent
waste
and
make
the
most
of
thing
.
<EOS>
there
should
always
be
one
steady
head
to
superintend
so
many
young
one
.
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
tell
Tom
of
something
that
happen
to
me
this
very
day
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
look
about
me
in
the
poultry
-
yard
,
and
be
just
come
out
,
when
who
should
I
see
<EOS>
but
Dick
Jackson
make
up
to
the
servant
'
hall
-
door
with
two
bit
of
deal
board
in
his
hand
,
bring
them
to
father
<EOS>
,
you
may
be
sure
;
mother
have
chance
to
send
him
of
a
message
to
father
,
and
then
father
have
bid
him
bring
up
them
two
bit
of
board
,
for
he
could
not
<EOS>
no
how
do
without
them
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
all
this
mean
,
for
the
servant
'
dinner
-
bell
be
ring
at
the
very
moment
over
our
head
;
and
as
I
hate
such
encroach
people
<EOS>
(
the
Jacksons
be
very
encroaching
,
I
have
always
say
so
<EOS>
:
just
the
sort
of
people
to
get
all
they
can

,
I
say
to
the
boy
directly
(
a
great
lubberly
fellow
of
ten
year
old
,
you
know
,
who
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
)
,
"
_
<EOS>
I
will
_
take
the
board
to
your
father
,
Dick
,
so
get
you
home
again
as
fast
as
you
can

<EOS>
"
the
boy
look
very
silly
,
and
turn
away
without
offer
a
word
,
for
I
believe
I
may
speak
pretty
sharp
;
and
I
dare
say
it
will
cure
him
of
come
maraud
about
the
house
for
one
while
.
<EOS>
I
hate
such
greediness
 
<EOS>
so
good
as
your
father
be
to
the
family
,
employ
the
man
all
the
year
round
!

"
  
<EOS>
nobody
be
at
the
trouble
of
an
answer
;
the
other
soon
return
;
and
Edmund
find
that
to
have
endeavour
to
set
them
right
must
be
his
only
satisfaction
.

pass
heavily

<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
relate
again
her
triumph
over
Dick
Jackson

neither

Mr.
Yates

who
be
try
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
Julia

find
her
gloom
less
impenetrable
on
any
topic

that
of
his
regret
at
her
secession

company

She

Lady
Bertram

but
Edmund

His

<EOS>
after
continue
in

a
few
minute

and
stand
by
them

seem
to
interest
herself
in
their
arrangement

,
as
if
strike
by
a
sudden
recollection
<EOS>

she
exclaim
,
"
<EOS>
My
good
friend
,
you
be
most
composedly
at
work
upon
these
cottage
and
alehouse
,
inside
and
out
;
but
pray
let
me
know
my
fate
in
the
meanwhile
.
<EOS>
who
be
to
be
Anhalt
?
<EOS>
what
gentleman
among
you
be
I
to
have
the
pleasure
of
make
love
to
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
for
a
moment
no
one
speak
;
and
then
many
speak
together
to
tell
the
same
melancholy
truth
,
that
they
have
not
yet
get
any
Anhalt
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Rushworth
be
to
be
Count
Cassel
,
but
no
one
have
yet
undertake
Anhalt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
my
choice
of
the
part
,
"
say
Mr.
Rushworth
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
think
I
should
like
the
Count
best
,
though
I
do
not
much
relish
the
finery
I
be
to
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
choose
very
wisely
,
I
be
sure
,
"
reply
Miss
Crawford
,
with
a
brightened
look
;
"
Anhalt
be
a
heavy
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
_
the
_
_
Count

have
two
-
and
-
forty
speech
,
"
return
Mr.
Rushworth
,
"
which
be
no
trifle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
at
all
surprised
,
"
say
Miss
Crawford
,
after
a
short
pause
,
"
at
this
want
of
an
Anhalt
.
<EOS>
Amelia
deserve
no
better
.
<EOS>
such
a
forward
young
lady
may
well
frighten
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
but
too
happy
in
take
the
part
,
if
it
be
possible
,
"
cry
Tom
;
"
but
,
unluckily
,
the
Butler
and
Anhalt
be
in
together
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
entirely
give
it
up
,
however
;
I
will
try
what
can
be
do
 
<EOS>
I
will
look
it
over
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Your
_
brother
_
should
take
the
part
,
"
say
Mr.
Yates
,
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
think
he
would
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
_
I
_
shall
not
ask
him

reply
Tom
,
in
a
cold
,
determined
manner
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
talk
of
something
else
,
and
soon
afterwards
rejoin
the
party
at
the
fire

<EOS>
"
They
do
not
want
me
at
all
,
"
say
she
,
seat
herself
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
puzzle
them
,
and
oblige
them
to
make
civil
speech
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Edmund
Bertram
,
as
you
do
not
act
yourself
,
you
will
be
a
disinterested
adviser
;
and
,
therefore
,
I
apply
to
_
you
_
.
<EOS>
what
shall
we
do
for
an
Anhalt
?
<EOS>
be
it
practicable
for
any
of
the
other
to
double
it
?
<EOS>
what
be
your
advice
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
advice
,
"
say
he
calmly
,
"
be
that
you
change
the
play
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
I
_
should
have
no
objection

"
she
reply
;
"
<EOS>
for
though
I
should
not
particularly
dislike
the
part
of
Amelia
if
well
support
,
that
is
,
if
everything
go
well
,
I
shall
be
sorry
to
be
an
inconvenience
;
but
as
they
do
not
chuse
to
hear
your
advice
at
_
that
_
_
table

_
"
(
look
round
)
,
"
it
certainly
will
not
be
take
.
"
  
<EOS>
Edmund
say
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
_
any
_
part
could
tempt
_
you
_
to
act
,
I
suppose
it
would
be
Anhalt
,
"
observe
the
lady
archly
,
after
a
short
pause
;
"
for
he
be
a
clergyman
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
_
that
_
circumstance
would
by
no
mean
tempt
me
,
"
he
reply
,
"
for
I
should
be
sorry
to
make
the
character
ridiculous
by
bad
acting
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
very
difficult
to
keep
Anhalt
from
appear
a
formal
,
solemn
lecturer
;
and
the
man
who
chuse
the
profession
itself
be
,
perhaps
,
one
of
the
last
who
would
wish
to
represent
it
on
the
stage

"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
be
silence
,
and
with
some
feeling
of
resentment
and
mortification
,
move
her
chair
considerably
nearer
the
tea

table

give
all
her
attention
to
Mrs.

<EOS>
Fanny
be
up
in
a
moment

expect
some
errand

for
the
habit
of
employ
her
in
that
way
be
not

overcome

in

all
that

It

it
be
a
nothing
of
a
part

a
mere
nothing

not

half
a
dozen
speeche
altogether
,
and
it
will
not
much
signify
if
nobody
hear
a
word
you
say

so
you
may
be

mouse

you

at
that

speaker
in

room

agitation

distressfully
at
Edmund

her

unwilling

exasperate
his

interference

her
only
an
encourage
smile

<EOS>
Her
entreaty
have
no
effect
on
Tom

he
only
say
again
what
he
have
say
before

it

Tom

for
the
requisition

now
back
by

Mr.
Crawford

Mr.
Yates

with
an
urgency
which
differ
from
his

but
in
be
more
gentle
or
more
ceremonious
,

which
altogether
be
quite
overpower
to
Fanny

before
she
could
breathe
after
it
,
Mrs.
Norris
complete
the
whole
by
thus
address
her
in
a
whisper
at

angry

audible
 
"
what
a
piece

do
not

Edmund

It
be

her
in

manner

let
her
chuse
for

I
be
not

Mrs.
Norris
sharply

I
shall
think
her
a

obstinate

ungrateful
girl

angry
to
speak
;

Miss
Crawford
,
look
for
a
moment
with
astonished
eye
at
Mrs.

and
then
at
Fanny

whose
tear
be
begin
to
shew
themselves

immediately
say
,
with
some
keenness
,
"
I
do
not

hot
for

away
her
chair
to
the
opposite
side
of

close
to
Fanny

to
her

low
whisper

never

this
be
a
cross
evening

everybody

cross

teasing

;
and
with
pointed
attention
continue
to
talk
to
her
and
endeavour
to
raise
her
spirit

by
a
look
at

she
prevent

favour

Fanny
do
not

Miss

very
much
oblige
to
her
for
her
present
kindness

from
take
notice
of
her
work

she

could
work
as
well

for
the
pattern

for
her

as
of

she

to

that

quite
a
curiosity
to

him
a

fine
young

advise
Fanny
to
get
his
picture
draw
before

to

again

she
could
not

admit
it
to

agreeable
flattery

with

from
Fanny
by
Tom
Bertram

tell
her
,
with
infinite
regret
,
that
he
find
it
absolutely
impossible
for
him
to
undertake
the
part
of
Anhalt
in
addition
to
the
Butler
:
he
have
be
most
anxiously
try
to
make
it
out
to
be
feasible
,
but
it
would
not
do
;
he
must
give
it
up
.

there
will
not

the
small
difficulty
in
fill
it
,
"
he
add
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
but
to
speak
the
word
;
we
may
pick
and
chuse

<EOS>
I
could
name
,
at
this
moment
,
at

six
young
man
within
six
mile
of
us

who
be
wild
to
be
admit
into
our
company

there
be
one
or
two
that
would
not
disgrace
us
:
<EOS>
I
should
not
be
afraid
to
trust
either
of
the
Olivers
or
Charles
Maddox

<EOS>
Tom
Oliver
be
a
very
clever
fellow
,
and
Charles
Maddox
be
as
gentlemanlike
a
man
as
you
will
see
anywhere

so
I
will
take
my
horse
early
to

morrow
morning

ride
over
to
Stoke

settle
with
one
of
them

he
speak

look
apprehensively
round
at
Edmund
in
full
expectation
that
he
must
oppose
such
an
enlargement
of
the
plan
as
this
:
so
contrary
to
all
their
first
protestation
;
but
Edmund
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
after
a
moment
's
thought
,
Miss
Crawford
calmly
reply
,
"
as
far
as
I

concern

I
can
have
no
objection

anything

yes

Henry

a
quiet

look
young

<EOS>
I
remember
him

<EOS>
let
_
him
_
be
apply
to
,
if
you
please

for
it
will
be
less
unpleasant

stranger

<EOS>
Charles
Maddox
be
to
be
the
man

<EOS>
Tom
repeat
his
resolution
of
go
to
him
early
on

and
though
Julia

who
have
scarcely
open
her
lip
before
,
observe
,
in
a
sarcastic
manner
,
and
with
a
glance
first
at
Maria
and
then
at
Edmund
,
that
"
the
Mansfield
theatrical

enliven
the

exceedingly

Edmund
still
hold
his
peace

shew
his

only
by
a
determined
gravity

<EOS>
"
I
be
not
very
sanguine
as
to
our
play

"
say
Miss
Crawford
,
in
an
undervoice
to
Fanny
,
after
some
consideration
;
"
and
I
can
tell
Mr.
Maddox
that
I
shall
shorten
some
of

his

speech
,

a
great
many
of

<EOS>
my

_
own
_
,
before
we
rehearse
together

<EOS>
It
will
be
very
disagreeable
,
and
by
no
mean
what
I
expect
.
"
    
<EOS>
It
be
not
in
Miss
Crawford
's
power
to
talk
Fanny
into
any
real
forgetfulness
of
what
have
pass
.
<EOS>
when
the
evening
be
over
,
she
go
to
bed
full
of
it
,
her
nerve
still
agitate
by
the
shock
of
such
an
attack
from
her
cousin
Tom
,
so
public
and
so
persevere
in
,
and
her
spirit
sink
under
her
aunt
's
unkind
reflection
and
reproach
.
<EOS>
to
be
call
into
notice
in
such
a
manner
,
to
hear
that
it
be
but
the
prelude
to
something
so
infinitely
bad
,
to
be
tell
that
she
must
do
what
be
so
impossible
as
to
act
;
and
then
to
have
the
charge
of
obstinacy
and
ingratitude
follow
it
,
enforce
with
such
a
hint
at
the
dependence
of
her
situation
,
have
be
too
distress
at
the
time
to
make
the
remembrance
when
she
be
alone
much
less
so
,
especially
with
the
superadded
dread
of
what
the
morrow
may
produce
in
continuation
of
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
have
protect
her
only
for
the
time
;
and
if
she
be
apply
to
again
among
themselves
with
all
the
authoritative
urgency
that
Tom
and
Maria
be
capable
of
,
and
Edmund
perhaps
away
,
what
should
she
do
?
<EOS>
She
fall
asleep
before
she
could
answer
the
question
,
and
find
it
quite
as
puzzle
when
she
awake
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
the
little
white
attic
,
which
have
continue
her
sleep
-
room
ever
since
her
first
enter
the
family
,
prove
incompetent
to
suggest
any
reply
<EOS>
,
she
have
recourse
,
as
soon
as
she
be
dress
,
to
another
apartment
more
spacious
and
more
meet
for
walk
about
in
and
think
,
and
of
which
she
have
now
<EOS>
for
some
time
be
almost
equally
mistress
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
their
school
-
room
;
so
call
till
the
Miss
Bertrams
would
not
allow
it
to
be
call
so
any
longer
,
and
inhabit
as
such
to
a
later
period
.
<EOS>
there
Miss
Lee
have
live
,
and
there
they
have
read
and
write
,
and
talk
and
laugh
,
till
within
the
last
three
year
,
when
she
have
quit
them
.
<EOS>
the
room
have
then
become
useless
,
and
for
some
time
be
quite
desert
,
except
by
Fanny
,
when
she
visit
her
plant
,
or
want
one
of
the
book
,
which
she
be
still
glad
to
keep
there
,
from
the
deficiency
of
space
and
accommodation
in
her
little
chamber
above
:
but
gradually
,
as
her
value
for
the
comfort
of
it
increase
,
she
have
add
to
her
possession
,
and
spend
more
of
her
time
there
;
and
have
nothing
to
oppose
her
,
have
so
naturally
and
so
artlessly
work
herself
into
it
,
that
it
be
now
generally
admit
to
be
her
.
<EOS>
the
East
room
,
as
it
have
be
call
ever
since
Maria
Bertram
be
sixteen
,
be
now
consider
Fanny
's
,
almost
as
decidedly
as
the
white
attic
:
the
smallness
of
the
one
make
the
use
of
the
other
so
evidently
reasonable
that
the
Miss
Bertrams
,
with
every
superiority
in
their
own
apartment
which
their
own
sense
of
superiority
could
demand
,
be
entirely
approve
it
;
and
Mrs.
Norris
,
have
stipulate
for
there
never
be
a
fire
in
it
on
Fanny
's
account
,
be
tolerably
resign
to
her
have
the
use
of
what
nobody
else
want
,
though
the
term
in
which
she
sometimes
speak
of
the
indulgence
seem
to
imply
that
it
be
the
good
room
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
aspect
be
so
favourable
that
even
without
a
fire
it
be
habitable
in
many
an
early
spring
and
late
autumn
morning
to
such
a
willing
mind
as
Fanny
's
;
and
while
there
be
a
gleam
of
sunshine
she
hope
not
to
be
drive
from
it
entirely
,
even
when
winter
come
.
<EOS>
the
comfort
of
it
in
her
hour
of
leisure
be
extreme
.
<EOS>
She
could
go
there
after
anything
unpleasant
below
,
and
find
immediate
consolation
in
some
pursuit
,
or
some
train
of
thought
at
hand
.
<EOS>
Her
plant
,
her
book
 
of
which
she
have
be
a
collector
from
the
first
hour
of
her
command
a
shilling
 
her
writing
-
desk
,
and
her
work
of
charity
and
ingenuity
,
be
all
within
her
reach
;
or
if
indispose
for
employment
,
if
nothing
but
musing
would
do
,
she
could
scarcely
see
an
object
in
that
room
which
have
not
an
interesting
remembrance
connect
with
it
.
<EOS>
everything
be
a
friend
,
or
bear
her
thought
to
a
friend
;
and
though
there
have
be
sometimes
much
of
suffer
to
her
;
though
her
motive
have
often
be
misunderstood
,
her
feeling
disregard
,
and
her
comprehension
undervalue
;
though
she
have
know
the
pain
of
tyranny
,
of
ridicule
,
and
neglect
,
yet
almost
every
recurrence
of
either
have
lead
to
something
consolatory
:
her
aunt
Bertram
have
speak
for
her
,
or
Miss
Lee
have
be
encouraging
,
or
,
what
be
yet
more
frequent
or
more
dear
<EOS>
,
Edmund
have
be
her
champion
and
her
friend
:
he
have
support
her
cause
or
explain
her
meaning
,
he
have
tell
her
not
to
cry
,
or
have
give
her
some
proof
of
affection
which
make
her
tear
delightful
;
and
the
whole
be
now
so
blended
together
,
so
harmonise
by
distance
,
that
every
former
affliction
have
its
charm
.
<EOS>
the
room
be
most
dear
to
her
,
and
she
would
not
have
change
its
furniture
for
the
handsome
in
the
house
,
though
what
have
be
originally
plain
have
suffer
all
the
ill
-
usage
of
child
;
and
its
great
elegancie
and
ornament
be
a
fade
footstool
of
Julia
's
work
,
too
ill
do
for
the
drawing
-
room
,
three
transparency
,
make
in
a
rage
for
transparency
,
for
the
three
low
pane
of
one
window
,
where
Tintern
Abbey
hold
its
station
between
a
cave
in
Italy
and
a
moonlight
lake
in
Cumberland
,
a
collection
of
family
profile
,
think
unworthy
of
be
anywhere
else
,
over
the
mantelpiece
,
and
by
their
side
,
and
pin
against
the
wall
,
a
small
sketch
of
a
ship
send
four
year
ago
from
the
Mediterranean
by
William
,
with
H.M.S.
Antwerp
at
the
bottom
,
in
letter
as
tall
as
the
mainmast
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
nest
of
comfort
<EOS>
Fanny
now
walk
down
to
try
its
influence
on
an
agitated
,
doubt
spirit
,
to
see
if
by
look
at
Edmund
's
profile
she
could
catch
any
of
his
counsel
,
or
by
give
air
to
her
geranium
she
may
inhale
a
breeze
of
mental
strength
herself
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
more
than
fear
of
her
own
perseverance
to
remove
:
she
have
begin
to
feel
undecided
as
to
what
she
_
ought
<EOS>
_
_
to
_
<EOS>
_
do
_
;
and
as
she
walk
round
the
room
her
doubt
be
increase
.
<EOS>
be
she
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
right
_
<EOS>
in
refuse
what
be
so
warmly
ask
,
so
strongly
wish
for
 
what
may
be
so
essential
to
a
scheme
on
which
some
of
those
to
whom
she
owe
the
great
complaisance
have
set
their
heart
?
<EOS>
be
it
not
ill
-
nature
,
selfishness
,
and
a
fear
of
expose
herself
?
<EOS>
and
would
Edmund
's
judgment
,
would
his
persuasion
of
Sir
Thomas
's
disapprobation
of
the
whole
,
be
enough
to
justify
her
in
a
determined
denial
in
spite
of
all
the
rest
?
<EOS>
It
would
be
so
horrible
to
her
to
act
that
she
be
incline
to
suspect
the
truth
and
purity
of
her
own
scruple
;
and
as
she
look
around
her
,
the
claim
of
her
cousin
to
be
oblige
be
strengthen
by
the
sight
of
present
upon
present
that
she
have
receive
from
them
.
<EOS>
the
table
between
the
window
be
cover
with
work
-
box
and
netting
-
box
which
have
be
give
her
at
different
time
,
principally
by
Tom
;
and
she
grow
bewilder
as
to
the
amount
of
the
debt
which
all
these
kind
remembrance
produce
.
<EOS>
a
tap
at
the
door
rouse
her
in
the
midst
of
this
attempt
to
find
her
way
to
her
duty
,
and
her
gentle
"
come
in
"
be
answer
by
the
appearance
of
one
,
before
whom
all
her
doubt
be
will
not
to
be
lay
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
brighten
at
the
sight
of
Edmund
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
I
speak
with
you
,
Fanny
,
for
a
few
minute
?

say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes

certainly
.
"
  
"
I
want
to

want
your

My

<EOS>

yes

your
advice
and
opinion

<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
to
do

<EOS>
this
act
scheme
get
bad
and
bad
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
They
have
choose
almost
as
bad
a
play
as
they
could
,
and
now
,
to
complete
the
business
,
be
go
to
ask
the
help
of
a
young
man
very
slightly
know
to
any
of
us
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
end
of
all
the
privacy
and
propriety
which
be
talk
about
at
first
.
<EOS>
I
know
no
harm
of
Charles
Maddox
;
but
the
excessive
intimacy
which
must
spring
from
his
being
admit
among
us
in
this
manner
be
highly
objectionable
,
the
_
more
_
than
intimacy
 
<EOS>
the
familiarity
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
think
of
it
with
any
patience
;
and
it
do
appear
to
me
an
evil
of
such
magnitude
as
must
,
_
if
_
_
<EOS>
possible
_
,
be
prevent
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
see
it
in
the

light
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
but
what
can
be
do
?
<EOS>
Your

be
so
determined

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
but
_
one
_
thing
to
be
do
,
Fanny
.
<EOS>
I
must
take
Anhalt
myself
.
<EOS>
I
be
well
aware
that
nothing
else
will
quiet
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
could
not
answer
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
at
all
what
I
like
,
"
he
continue
.
<EOS>
"
no
man
can
like
be
drive
into
the
_
appearance

of
such
inconsistency

<EOS>
after
be

to
oppose
the
scheme
from
the
beginning

there
be
absurdity
in
the
face
of
my
join
them
_
now
_
,
when
they
be
exceed
their
first
plan
in
every
respect
;
but
I
can
think
of
no
other
alternative
.
<EOS>
Can
you
,
Fanny
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Fanny
slowly
,
"
not
immediately
,
but
 
"
  
"
but
what
?
<EOS>
I
see
your
judgment
be
not
with
me
.
<EOS>
think
it
a
little
over
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
be
not
so
much
aware
as
I
be
of
the
mischief
that
_
may
_
,
of
the
unpleasantness
that
_
must
_
arise
from
<EOS>
a
young
man
's
be
receive
in
this
manner
:
domesticate
among
us
;
authorise
to
come
at
all
hour
,
and
place
suddenly
on
a
footing
which
must
do
away
all
restraint
.
<EOS>
to
think
only
of
the
licence
which
every
rehearsal
must
tend
to
create
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
very
bad
!
<EOS>
put
yourself
in
Miss
Crawford
's
place
,
Fanny
.
<EOS>
consider
what
it
would
be
to
act
Amelia
with
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
right
to
be
feel
for
,
because
she
evidently
feel
for
herself
.
<EOS>
I
hear
enough
of
what
she
say
to
you
last
night
to
understand
her
unwillingness
to
be
act
with
a
stranger
;
and
as
she
probably
engage
in
the
part
with
different
expectation
 
perhaps
without
consider
the
subject
enough
to
know
what
be
likely
to
be
 
it
would
be
ungenerous
,
it
would
be
really
wrong
to
expose
her
to
it
.
<EOS>
Her
feeling
ought
to
be
respect
.
<EOS>
do
it
not
strike
you
so
,
Fanny
?
<EOS>
You
hesitate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
for
Miss
Crawford
;
but
I
be
more
sorry
to
see
you
draw
in
to
do
what
you
have
resolve
against
,
and
what
you
be
know
to
think
will
be
disagreeable
to
my
uncle
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
such
a
triumph
to
the
other
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
will
not
have
much
cause
of
triumph
when
they
see
how
infamously
I
act
.
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
triumph
there
certainly
will
be
,
and
I
must
brave
it
.
<EOS>
but
if
I
can
be
the
mean
of
restrain
the
publicity
of
the
business
,
of
limit
the
exhibition
,
of
concentrate
our
folly

I
shall
be
well
repay

<EOS>
as
I
be
now

I
have
no
influence
,
I
can
do
nothing
:
I
have
offend
them

they
will
not
hear
me
;

when
I
have
put
them
in
good

humour
by
this
concession

I
be
not

hope
of
persuade
them
to
confine
the
representation
within
a
much
small
circle
than
they
be
now
in
the
high
road
for
.
<EOS>
this
will
be
a
material
gain

<EOS>
My
object
be
to
confine
it
to
Mrs.
Rushworth

the
Grants

Will
not
this

worth
gain

yes

it

a
great
point

you

equal
good

no

if

give
pleasure
there

<EOS>
and
now
,
dear
Fanny
,
I
will
not
interrupt
you
any
longer
.
<EOS>
You
want
to
be
read
.
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
be
easy
till
I
have
speak
to
you
,
and
come
to
a
decision
.
<EOS>
sleep
or
wake
,
my
head
have
be
full
of
this
matter
all
night
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
evil
,
but
I
be
certainly
make
it
less
than
it
may
be
.
<EOS>
if
Tom
be
up
,
I
shall
go
to
him
directly
and
get
it
over
,
and
when
we
meet
at
breakfast
we
shall
be
all
in
high
good
-
humour
at
the
prospect
of
act
the
fool
together
with
such
unanimity
.
<EOS>
_
You
_
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
will
be
take
a
trip
into
China
,
I
suppose

<EOS>
how
do
Lord
Macartney
go
on
?
"
 
<EOS>
open
a
volume
on
the
table
and
then
take
up
some
other

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
here
be
Crabbe
's
Tales
,
and
the
Idler
,
at
hand
to
relieve
you
,
if
you
tire
of
your
great
book
.
<EOS>
I
admire
your
little
establishment
exceedingly
;
and
as
soon
as
I
be
go
,
you
will
empty
your
head
of
all
this
nonsense
of
acting
,
and
sit
comfortably
down
to
your
table
.
<EOS>
but
do
not
stay
here
to
be
cold
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
go
;
but
there
be
no
reading
,
no
China
,
no
composure
for
Fanny
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
her
the
most
extraordinary
,
the
most
inconceivable
,
the
most
unwelcome
news
;
and
she
could
think
of
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
to
be
act
!
<EOS>
after
all
his
objection
 
objection
so
just
and
so
public
!
<EOS>
after
all
that
she
have
hear
him
say
,
and
see
him
look
,
and
know
him
to
be
feel
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
possible
?
<EOS>
Edmund
so
inconsistent
!
<EOS>
be
he
not
deceive
himself
?
<EOS>
be
he
not
wrong
?
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
it
be
all
Miss
Crawford
's
doing
.
<EOS>
She
have
see
her
influence
in
every
speech
,
and
be
miserable
.
<EOS>
the
doubt
and
alarm
as
to
her
own
conduct
,
which
have
previously
distress
her
,
and
which
have
all
sleep
while
she
listen
to
him
,
be
become
of
little
consequence
now
.
<EOS>
this
deep
anxiety
swallow
them
up
.
<EOS>
thing
should
take
their
course
;
she
care
not
how
it
end
.
<EOS>
Her
cousin
may
attack
,
but
could
hardly
tease
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
beyond
their
reach
;
and
if
at
last
oblige
to
yield
 
no
matter
 
<EOS>
it
be
all
misery
now
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
,
indeed
,
a
triumphant
day
to
Mr.
Bertram
and
Maria
.
<EOS>
such
a
victory
over
Edmund
's
discretion
have
be
beyond
their
hope
,
and
be
most
delightful
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
long
anything
to
disturb
them
in
their
darling
project
,
and
they
congratulate
each
other
in
private
on
the
jealous
weakness
to
which
they
attribute
the
change
,
with
all
the
glee
of
feeling
gratify
in
every
way
.
<EOS>
Edmund
may
still
look
grave
,
and
say
he
do
not
like
the
scheme
in
general
,
and
must
disapprove
the
play
in
particular
;
their
point
be
gain
:
he
be
to
act
,
and
he
be
drive
to
it
by
the
force
of
selfish
inclination
only
.
<EOS>
Edmund
have
descend
from
that
moral
elevation
which
he
have
maintain
before
,
and
they
be
both
as
much
the
well
as
the
happy
for
the
descent
.
  
<EOS>
They
behave
very
well
,
however
,
to
_
him
_
on
the
occasion
,
betray
no
exultation
beyond
the
line
about
the
corner
of
the
mouth
,
and
seem
to
think
it
as
great
an
escape
to
be
quit
of
the
intrusion
of
Charles
Maddox
,
as
if
they
have
be
force
into
admit
him
against
their
inclination
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
to
have
it
quite
in
their
own
family
circle
be
what
they
have
particularly
wish
.
<EOS>
a
stranger
among
them
would
have
be
the
destruction
of
all
their
comfort
"
;
and
when
Edmund
,
pursue
that
idea
,
give
a
hint
of
his
hope
as
to
the
limitation
of
the
audience
,
they
be
ready
,
in
the
complaisance
of
the
moment
,
to
promise
anything
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
good
-
humour
and
encouragement
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
offer
to
contrive
his
dress
,
Mr.
Yates
assure
him
that
Anhalt
's
last
scene
with
the
Baron
admit
a
good
deal
of
action
and
emphasis
,
and
Mr.
Rushworth
undertake
to
count
his
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
"
say
Tom
,
"
Fanny
may
be
more
disposed
to
oblige
us
now
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
may
persuade
_
her
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
she
be
quite
determined
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
will
not
act

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
not
another
word
be

;
but
Fanny
feel
herself
again
in
danger
,
and
her
indifference
to
the
danger
be
begin
to
fail
her
already
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
not
few
smile
at
the
Parsonage
than
at
the
Park
on
this
change
in
Edmund
;
Miss
Crawford
look
very
lovely
in
hers
,
and
enter
with
such
an
instantaneous
renewal
of
cheerfulness
into
the
whole
affair
as
could
have
but
one
effect
on
him
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
certainly
right
in
respect
such
feeling
;
he
be
glad
he
have
determine
on
it
.
"
<EOS>
and
the
morning
wear
away
in
satisfaction
<EOS>
very
sweet
,
if
not
very
sound
.
<EOS>
one
advantage
result
from
it
to
Fanny
:
at
the
earnest
request
of
Miss
Crawford
,
Mrs.
Grant
have
,
with
her
usual
good
-
humour
,
agree
to
undertake
the
part
for
which
Fanny
have
be
want
;
and
this
be
all
that
occur
to
gladden
_
<EOS>
her
_
heart
during
the
day
;
and
even
this
,
when
impart
by
Edmund
,
bring
a
pang
with
it
,
for
it
be
Miss
Crawford
to
whom
she
be
oblige
 
<EOS>
it
be
Miss
Crawford
whose
kind
exertion
be
to
excite
her
gratitude
,
and
whose
merit
in
make
them
be
speak
of
with
a
glow
of
admiration
.
<EOS>
She
be
safe
;
but
peace
and
safety
be
unconnecte
here
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
have
be
never
farth
from
peace
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
feel
that
she
have
do
wrong
herself
,
but
she
be
disquiet
in
every
other
way
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
and
her
judgment
be
equally
against
Edmund
's
decision
:
she
could
not
acquit
his
unsteadiness
,
and
his
happiness
under
it
make
her
wretched
.
<EOS>
She
be
full
of
jealousy
and
agitation
.
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
come
with
look
of
gaiety
which
seem
an
insult
,
with
friendly
expression
towards
herself
which
she
could
hardly
answer
calmly
.
<EOS>
everybody
around
her
be
gay
and
busy
,
prosperous
and
important
;
each
have
their
object
of
interest
,
their
part
,
their
dress
,
their
favourite
scene
,
their
friend
and
confederate
:
all
be
find
employment
in
consultation
and
comparison
,
or
diversion
in
the
playful
conceit
they
suggest
.
<EOS>
She
alone
be
sad
and
insignificant
:
she
have
no
share
in
anything
;
she
may
go
or
stay
;
she
may
be
in
the
midst
of
their
noise
,
or
retreat
from
it
to
the
solitude
of
the
East
room
,
without
be
see
or
miss
.
<EOS>
She
could
almost
think
anything
would
have
be
preferable
to
this
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grant
be
of
consequence
:
_
<EOS>
her
_
good
-
nature
have
honourable
mention
;
her
taste
and
her
time
be
consider
;
her
presence
be
want
;
she
be
seek
for
,
and
attend
,
and
praise
;
and
Fanny
be
at
first
in
some
danger
of
envy
her
the
character
she
have
accept
.
<EOS>
but
reflection
bring
well
feeling
,
and
shew
her
that
Mrs.
Grant
be
entitle
to
respect
,
which
could
never
have
belong
to
_
her
_
;
and
that
,
have
she
receive
even
the
great
,
she
could
never
have
be
easy
in
join
a
scheme
which
,
consider
only
her
uncle
,
she
must
condemn
altogether
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
's
heart
be
not
absolutely
the
only
sadden
one
amongst
them
,
as
she
soon
begin
to
acknowledge
to
herself
.
<EOS>
Julia
be
a
sufferer
too
,
though
not
quite
so
blamelessly
.
  
<EOS>
Henry
Crawford
have
trifle
with
her
feeling
;
but
she
have
very
long
allow
and
even
seek
his
attention
,
with
a
jealousy
of
her
sister
so
reasonable
as
ought
to
have
be
their
cure
;
and
now
that
the
conviction
of
his
preference
for
Maria
have
be
force
on
her
,
she
submit
to
it
without
any
alarm
for
Maria
's
situation
,
or
any
endeavour
at
rational
tranquillity
for
herself
.
<EOS>
She
either
sit
in
gloomy
silence
,
wrapt
in
such
gravity
as
nothing
could
subdue
,
no
curiosity
touch
,
no
wit
amuse
;
or
allow
the
attention
of
Mr.
Yates
,
be
talk
with
force
gaiety
to
him
alone
,
and
ridicule
the
acting
of
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
for
a
day
or
two
after
the
affront
be
give
,
Henry
Crawford
have
endeavour
to
do
it
away
by
the
usual
attack
of
gallantry
and
compliment
,
but
he
have
not
care
enough
about
it
to
persevere
against
a
few
repulse
;
and
become
soon
too
busy
with
his
play
to
have
time
for
more
than
one
flirtation
<EOS>
,
he
grow
indifferent
to
the
quarrel
,
or
rather
think
it
a
lucky
occurrence
,
as
quietly
put
an
end
to
what
may
ere
long
have
raise
expectation
in
more
than
Mrs.
Grant
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
pleased
to
see
Julia
exclude
from
the
play
,
and
sit
by
disregard
;
but
as
it
be
not
a
matter
which
really
involve
her
happiness
,
as
Henry
must
be
the
good
judge
of
his
own
,
and
as
he
do
assure
her
,
with
a
most
persuasive
smile
,
that
neither
he
nor
Julia
have
ever
have
a
serious
thought
of
each
other
,
she
could
only
renew
her
former
caution
as
to
the
eld
sister
,
entreat
him
not
to
risk
his
tranquillity
by
too
much
admiration
there
,
and
then
gladly
take
her
share
in
anything
that
bring
cheerfulness
to
the
young
people
in
general

and
that
do
so
particularly
promote
the
pleasure
of
the

so
dear

Maria
feel
her
triumph

pursue
her
purpose

Julia
could
never

Maria
distinguish
by
Henry
Crawford
without
trust
that
it

create
jealousy

bring
a
public
disturbance
at

<EOS>
Fanny
see
and
pity
much
of
this
in
Julia

but
there
be
no
outward
fellowship
between
them

Julia
make
no
communication

and
Fanny
take
no
liberty
.
<EOS>
They
be
two
solitary
sufferer
,
or
connect
only
by
Fanny
's
consciousness

<EOS>
the
inattention
of
the
two
brother
and
the
aunt
to
Julia
's
discomposure
,
and
their
blindness
to
its
true
cause
,
must
be
impute
to
the
fullness
of
their
own
mind
.
<EOS>
They
be
totally
preoccupied
.
<EOS>
Tom
be
engross
by
the
concern
of
his
theatre
,
and
see
nothing
that
do
not
immediately
relate
to
it

<EOS>
Edmund
,
between
his
theatrical
and
his
real
part
,
between
Miss
Crawford
's
claim
and
his
own
conduct
,
between
love
and
consistency
,
be
equally
unobservant
;
and
Mrs.
Norris
be
too
busy
in
contrive
and
direct
the
general
little
matter
of
the
company
,
superintend
their
various
dress
with
economical
expedient

for

with
delighted

half
a

here

there
to
the

Sir
Thomas

to
have
leisure

guard
the
happiness
of
his

<EOS>
Everything
be
now
in
a
regular
train
:
theatre
,
actor
,
actress
,
and
dress
,
be
all
get
forward
;
but
though
no
other
great
impediment
arise
,
Fanny
find
,
before
many
day
be
past
,
that
it
be
not
all
uninterrupted
enjoyment
to
the
party
themselves
,
and
that
she
have
not
to
witness
the
continuance
of
such
unanimity
and
delight
as
have
be
almost
too
much
for
her
at
first
.
<EOS>
everybody
begin
to
have
their
vexation
.
<EOS>
Edmund
have
many
.
<EOS>
entirely
against
_
his
_
judgment
,
a
scene
-
painter
arrive
from
town
,
and
be
at
work
,
much
to
the
increase
of
the
expense
,
and
,
what
be
bad
,
of
the
eclat
of
their
proceeding
;
and
his
brother
,
instead
of
be
really
guide
by
him
as
to
the
privacy
of
the
representation
,
be
give
an
invitation
to
every
family
who
come
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
Tom
himself
begin
to
fret
over
the
scene
-
painter
's
slow
progress
,
and
to
feel
the
misery
of
wait
.
<EOS>
He
have
learn
his
part
 
all
his
part
,
for
he
take
every
trifling
one
that
could
be
unite
with
the
Butler
,
and
begin
to
be
impatient
to
be
act
;
and
every
day
thus
unemployed
be
tend
to
increase
his
sense
of
the
insignificance
of
all
his
part
together
,
and
make
him
more
ready
to
regret
that
some
other
play
have
not
be
choose
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
,
be
always
a
very
courteous
listener
,
and
often
the
only
listener
at
hand
,
come
in
for
the
complaint
and
the
distress
of
most
of
them
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
know
that
Mr.
Yates
be
in
general
thought
to
rant
dreadfully
;
that
Mr.
Yates
be
disappoint
in
Henry
Crawford
;
that
Tom
Bertram
speak
so
quick
he
would
be
unintelligible
;
that
Mrs.
Grant
spoil
everything
by
laugh
;
that
Edmund
be
behindhand
with
his
part
,
and
that
it
be
misery
to
have
anything
to
do
with
Mr.
Rushworth
,
who
be
want
a
prompter
through
every
speech
.
<EOS>
She
know
,
also
,
that
poor
Mr.
Rushworth
could
seldom
get
anybody
to
rehearse
with
him
:
_
<EOS>
his
_
complaint
come
before
her
as
well
as
the
rest
;
and
so
decide
to
her
eye
be
her
cousin
Maria
's
avoidance
of
him
,
and
so
needlessly
often
the
rehearsal
of
the
first
scene
between
her
and
Mr.
Crawford
,
that
she
have
soon
all
the
terror
of
other
complaint
from
_
him
_
.
<EOS>
so
far
from
be
all
satisfied
and
all
enjoy
,
she
find
everybody
require
something
they
have
not
,
and
give
occasion
of
discontent
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
everybody
have
a
part
either
too
long
or
too
short
;
nobody
would
attend
as
they
ought
;
nobody
would
remember
on
which
side
they
be
to
come
in
;
nobody
but
the
complainer
would
observe
any
direction
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
believe
herself
to
derive
as
much
innocent
enjoyment
from
the
play
as
any
of
them
;
Henry
Crawford
act
well
,
and
it
be
a
pleasure
to
_
her
_
to
creep
into
the
theatre
,
and
attend
the
rehearsal
of
the
first
act
,
in
spite
of
the
feeling
it
excite
in
some
speech
for
Maria
.
<EOS>
Maria
,
she
also
think
,
act
well
,
too
well
;
and
after
the
first
rehearsal
or
two
,
Fanny
begin
to
be
their
only
audience
;
and
sometimes
as
prompter
,
sometimes
as
spectator
,
be
often
very
useful
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
she
could
judge
,
Mr.
Crawford
be
considerably
the
good
actor
of
all
:
he
have
more
confidence
than
Edmund
,
more
judgment
than
Tom
,
more
talent
and
taste
than
Mr.
Yates
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
like
him
as
a
man
,
but
she
must
admit
him
to
be
the
good
actor
,
and
on
this
point
there
be
not
many
who
differ
from
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Yates
,
indeed
,
exclaim
against
his
tameness
and
insipidity
;
and
the
day
come
at
last
,
when
Mr.
Rushworth
turn
to
her
with
a
black
look
,
and
say
,
"
do
you
think
there
be
anything
so
very
fine
in
all
this
?
<EOS>
for
the
life
and
soul
of
me
,
I
can
not
admire
him
;
and
,
between
ourselves
,
to
see
such
an
undersized
,
little
,
mean
-
looking
man
,
set
up
for
a
fine
actor
,
be
very
ridiculous
in
my
opinion
.
"
  
<EOS>
from
this
moment
there
be
a
return
of
his
former
jealousy
,
which
Maria
,
from
increase
hope
of
Crawford
,
be
at
little
pain
to
remove
;
and
the
chance
of
Mr.
Rushworth
's
ever
attain
to
the
knowledge
of
his
two
-
and
-
forty
speech
become
much
less
.
<EOS>
as
to
his
ever
make
anything
_
tolerable
_
of
them
,
nobody
have
the
small
idea
of
that
except
his
mother
;
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
she
_
,
indeed
,
regret
that
his
part
be
not
more
considerable
,
and
defer
come
over
to
Mansfield
till
they
be
forward
enough
in
their
rehearsal
to
comprehend
all
his
scene
;
but
the
other
aspire
at
nothing
beyond
his
remember
the
catchword
,
and
the
first
line
of
his
speech
,
and
be
able
to
follow
the
prompter
through
the
rest
.
<EOS>
Fanny
,
in
her
pity
and
kindheartedness
,
be
at
great
pain
to
teach
him
how
to
learn
,
give
him
all
the
help
and
direction
in
her
power
,
try
to
make
an
artificial
memory
for
him
,
and
learn
every
word
of
his
part
herself
,
but
without
his
be
much
the
forwarder
.
  
<EOS>
many
uncomfortable
,
anxious
,
apprehensive
feeling
she
certainly
have
;
but
with
all
these
,
and
other
claim
on
her
time
and
attention
,
she
be
as
far
from
find
herself
without
employment
or
utility
amongst
them
,
as
without
a
companion
in
uneasiness
;
quite
as
far
from
have
no
demand
on
her
leisure
as
on
her
compassion
.
<EOS>
the
gloom
of
her
first
anticipation
be
prove
to
have
be
unfounded
.
<EOS>
She
be
occasionally
useful
to
all
;
she
be
perhaps
as
much
at
peace
as
any
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
deal
of
needlework
to
be
do
,
moreover
,
in
which
her
help
be
want
;
and
that
Mrs.
Norris
think
her
quite
as
well
off
as
the
rest
,
be
evident
by
the
manner
in
which
she
claim
it
 
<EOS>
"
come
,
Fanny
<EOS>
,
"
she
cry
,
"
these
be
fine
time
for
you
,
but
you
must
not
be
always
walk
from
one
room
to
the
other
,
and
do
the
looking
-
on
at
your
ease
,
in
this
way
;
I
want
you
here
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
slave
myself
till
I
can
hardly
stand
,
to
contrive
Mr.
Rushworth
's
cloak
without
send
for
any
more
satin
;
and
now
I
think
you
may
give
me
your
help
in
put
it
together

<EOS>
there
be
but
three
seam
;
you
may
do
them
in
a
trice

<EOS>
It
would
be
lucky
for
me
if
I
have
nothing
but
the
executive
part
to
do
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
be
best
off

I
can
tell
you
:
but
if
nobody
do
more
than

you

,
we
should
not
get
on
very
fast

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
take
the
work
very
quietly
,
without
attempt
any
defence
;
but
her
kinder
aunt
Bertram
observe
on
her
behalf
    
<EOS>
"
one
can
not
wonder
,
sister
,
that
Fanny
_
should
_
be
delighted
:
it
be
all
new
to
her
,
you
know
;
you
and
I
use
to
be
very
fond
of
a
play
ourselves
,
and
so
be
I
still
;
and
as
soon
as
I
be
a
little
more
at
leisure
,
_
<EOS>
I
_
mean
to
look
in
at
their
rehearsal
too

<EOS>
what
be
the
play
about
,
Fanny
?
<EOS>
you
have
never
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
sister
,
pray
do
not
ask
her
now
;
for
Fanny
be
not
one
of
those
who
can
talk
and
work
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
It
be
about
Lovers
'
vow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
"
say
Fanny
to
her
aunt
Bertram
,
"
there
will
be
three
act
rehearse
to
-
morrow
evening
,
and
that
will
give
you
an
opportunity
of
see
all
the
actor
at
once

<EOS>
"
You
have
well
stay
till
the
curtain
be
hung

interpose
Mrs.
Norris
;
"
the
curtain
will
be
hang
in
a
day
or
two
 
<EOS>
there
be
very
little
sense
in
a
play
without
a
curtain
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
much
mistaken
if
you
do
not
find
it
draw
up
into
very
handsome
festoon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Bertram
seem
quite
resign
to
wait
.
<EOS>
Fanny
do
not
share
her
aunt
's
composure
:
she
think
of
the
morrow
a
great
deal
,
for
if
the
three
act
be
rehearse
,
Edmund
and
Miss
Crawford
would
then
be
act
together
for
the
first
time
;
the
third
act
would
bring
a
scene
between
them
which
interest
her
most
particularly
,
and
which
she
be
long
and
dread
to
see
how
they
would
perform
.
<EOS>
the
whole
subject
of
it
be
love
 
<EOS>
a
marriage
of
love
be
to
be
describe
by
the
gentleman
,
and
very
little
short
of
a
declaration
of
love
be
make
by
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
read
and
read
the
scene
again
with
many
painful
,
many
wonder
emotion
,
and
look
forward
to
their
representation
of
it
as
a
circumstance
almost
too
interesting
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
_
believe
_
<EOS>
they
have
yet
rehearse
it
,
even
in
private
.
  
<EOS>
the
morrow
come
,
the
plan
for
the
evening
continue
,
and
Fanny
's
consideration
of
it
do
not
become
less
agitated
.
<EOS>
She
work
very
diligently
under
her
aunt
's
direction
,
but
her
diligence
and
her
silence
conceal
a
very
absent
,
anxious
mind
;
and
about
noon
she
make
her
escape
with
her
work
to
the
East
room
,
that
she
may
have
no
concern
in
another
,
and
,
as
she
deem
it
,
most
unnecessary
rehearsal
of
the
first
act
,
which
Henry
Crawford
be
just
propose
,
desirous
at
once
of
have
her
time
to
herself
,
and
of
avoid
the
sight
of
Mr.
Rushworth
.
<EOS>
a
glimpse
,
as
she
pass
through
the
hall
,
of
the
two
lady
walk
up
from
the
Parsonage
make
no
change
in
her
wish
of
retreat
,
and
she
work
and
meditate
in
the
East
room
,
undisturbed
,
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
when
a
gentle
tap
at
the
door
be
follow
by
the
entrance
of
Miss
Crawford
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
I
right
?
<EOS>
yes
;
this
be
the
East
room

My
dear
Miss
Price
,
I
beg
your
pardon
,
but
I
have
make
my
way
to
you
on
purpose
to
entreat
your
help

"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
,
quite
surprised
,
endeavour
to
shew
herself
mistress
of
the
room
by
her
civility
,
and
look
at
the
bright
bar
of
her
empty
grate
with
concern
.
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
;
I
be
quite
warm

very
warm

<EOS>
allow
me
to
stay
here
a
little
while

do
have
the
goodness
to
hear
me
my
third
act

<EOS>
I
have
bring
my
book
,
and
if
you
would
but
rehearse
it
with
me

I
should
be
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
so
_
oblige

<EOS>
I
come
here
to

day
intend
to
rehearse
it
with
Edmund
 
by
ourselves
 
against
the
evening
,
but
he
be
not
in
the
way
;
and
if
he
_
be
_
,
I
do
not

I
could
go
through
it
with
_
him
_
,
till
I
have
harden
myself
a
little
;
for
really
there
be
a
speech
or
two
.

You
will
be
so
good
,
will
not
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
be
most
civil
in
her
assurance
,
though
she
could
not
give
them
in
a
very
steady
voice

<EOS>
"
have
you
ever
happen
to
look
at
the
part
I
mean
?
<EOS>
"
continue
Miss
Crawford
,
open
her
book
.
<EOS>
"
here
it
be
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
much
of
it
at
first
 
but
,
upon
my
word
.
<EOS>
there
,
look
at
_
that
_
speech
,
and
_
that
_
,
and
_
that
_
.
<EOS>
how
be
I
ever
to
look
him
in
the
face
and
say
such
thing
?
<EOS>
Could
you
do
it
?
<EOS>
but
then
he
be
your
cousin
,
which
make
all
the
difference
.
<EOS>
You
must
rehearse
it
with
me
,
that
I
may
fancy
_
<EOS>
you
_
him
,

get
on
by
degree

have
I

<EOS>
I
will
do
my
good
with
the
great
readiness
;
but
I
must

_
<EOS>
the
part

I
can
say
very
little
of
it

_
None

You

We

;
much
more
fit
for
little
girl
to
sit
and
kick
their
foot
against
when
they
be
learn
a
lesson
.
<EOS>
what
would
your
governess
and
your
uncle
say
to
see
them
use
for
such
a
purpose
?
<EOS>
Could
Sir
Thomas
look
in
upon
us
just
now
,
he
would
bless
himself
,
for
we
be
rehearse
all
over
the
house
.
<EOS>
Yates
be
storm
away
in
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
I
hear
him
as
I
come
upstairs
,
and
the
theatre
be
engage
of
course
by
those
indefatigable
rehearser
,
Agatha
and
Frederick
.
<EOS>
if
_
they
_
be
not
perfect
,
I
_
shall
_
be
surprised
.
<EOS>
by
the
bye
,
I
look
in
upon
them
five
minute
ago
,
and
it
happen
to
be
exactly
at
one
of
the
time
when
they
be
try
_
not
_
to
embrace
,
and
Mr.
Rushworth
be
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
begin
to
look
a
little
queer
,
so
I
turn
it
off
as
well
as
I
could
,
by
whisper
to
him
,
"
We
shall
have
an
excellent
Agatha
;
there
be
something
<EOS>
so
_
maternal
_
<EOS>
in
her
manner
,
so
completely
_
maternal
_
in
her
voice
and
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
be
not
that
well
do
of
me
?
<EOS>
He
brighten
up
directly
.
<EOS>
now
for
my
soliloquy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
begin
,
and
Fanny
join
in
with
all
the
modest
feeling
which
the
idea
of
represent
Edmund
be
so
strongly
calculated
to
inspire
;
but
with
look
and
voice
so
truly
feminine
as
to
be
no
very
good
picture
of
a
man
.
<EOS>
with
such
an
Anhalt
,
however
,
Miss
Crawford
have
courage
enough
;
and
they
have
get
through
half
the
scene
,
when
a
tap
at
the
door
bring
a
pause
,
and
the
entrance
of
Edmund
,
the
next
moment
,
suspend
it
all
.
  
<EOS>
surprise
,
consciousness
,
and
pleasure
appear
in
each
of
the
three
on
this
unexpected
meeting
;
and
as
Edmund
be
come
on
the
very
same
business
that
have
bring
Miss
Crawford
,
consciousness
and
pleasure
be
likely
to
be
more
than
momentary
in
_
them
_
.
<EOS>
He
too
have
his
book
,
and
be
seek
Fanny
,
to
ask
her
to
rehearse
with
him
,
and
help
him
to
prepare
for
the
evening
,
without
know
Miss
Crawford
to
be
in
the
house
;
and
great
be
the
joy
and
animation
of
be
thus
throw
together
,
of
compare
scheme
,
and
sympathise
in
praise
of
Fanny
's
kind
office
.
  
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
could
not
equal
them
in
their
warmth
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Her
_
spirit
sink
under
the
glow
of
theirs
,
and
she
feel
herself
become
too
nearly
nothing
to
both
to
have
any
comfort
in
have
be
seek
by
either
.
<EOS>
They
must
now
rehearse
together
.
<EOS>
Edmund
propose
,
urge
,
entreat
it
,
till
the
lady
,
not
very
unwilling
at
first
,
could
refuse
no
longer
,
and
Fanny
be
want
only
to
prompt
and
observe
them
.
<EOS>
She
be
invest
,
indeed
,
with
the
office
of
judge
and
critic
,
and
earnestly
desire
to
exercise
it
and
tell
them
all
their
fault
;
but
from
do
so
every
feeling
within
her
shrink
 
<EOS>
she
could
not
,
would
not
,
dare
not
attempt
it
:
have
she
be
otherwise
qualified
for
criticism
,
her
conscience
must
have
restrain
her
from
venture
at
disapprobation
.
<EOS>
She
believe
herself
to
feel
too
much
of
it
in
the
aggregate
for
honesty
or
safety
in
particular
.
<EOS>
to
prompt
them
must
be
enough
for
her
;
and
it
be
sometimes
_
more
_
than
enough
;
for
she
could
not
always
pay
attention
to
the
book
.
<EOS>
in
watch
them
she
forget
herself
;
and
,
agitate
by
the
increase
spirit
of
Edmund
's
manner
,
have
once
close
the
page
and
turn
away
exactly
as
he
want
help
.
<EOS>
It
be
impute
to
very
reasonable
weariness
,
and
she
be
thank
and
pity
;
but
she
deserve
their
pity
more
than
she
hope
they
would
ever
surmise
.
<EOS>
at
last
the
scene
be
over
,
and
Fanny
force
herself
to
add
her
praise
to
the
compliment
each
be
give
the
other
;
and
when
again
alone
and
able
to
recall
the
whole
<EOS>
,
she
be
incline
to
believe
their
performance
would
,
indeed
,
have
such
nature
and
feeling
in
it
as
must
ensure
their
credit
,
and
make
it
a
very
suffering
exhibition
to
herself
.
<EOS>
whatever
may
be
its
effect
,
however
,
she
must
stand
the
brunt
of
it
again
that
very
day
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
regular
rehearsal
of
the
three
first
act
be
certainly
to
take
place
in
the
evening
:
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grant
and
the
Crawfords
be
engage
to
return
for
that
purpose
as
soon
as
they
could
after
dinner
;
and
every
one
concern
be
look
forward
with
eagerness
.
<EOS>
there
seem
a
general
diffusion
of
cheerfulness
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
Tom
be
enjoy
such
an
advance
towards
the
end
;
Edmund
be
in
spirit
from
the
morning
's
rehearsal
,
and
little
vexation
seem
everywhere
smooth
away
.
<EOS>
all
be
alert
and
impatient
;
the
lady
move
soon
,
the
gentleman
soon
follow
them
,
and
with
the
exception
of
Lady
Bertram
,
Mrs.
Norris
,
and
Julia
,
everybody
be
in
the
theatre
at
an
early
hour
;
and
have
light
it
up
as
well
as
its
unfinished
state
admit
,
be
wait
only
the
arrival
of
Mrs.
Grant
and
the
Crawfords
to
begin
.
  
<EOS>
They
do
not
wait
long
for
the
Crawfords
,
but
there
be
no
Mrs.
Grant
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
come
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grant
,
profess
an
indisposition
,
for
which
he
have
little
credit
with
his
fair
sister
-
in
-
law
,
could
not
spare
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dr.
Grant
be
ill
,
"
say
she
,
with
mock
solemnity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
have
be
ill
ever
since
he
do
not
eat
any
of
the
pheasant
today
.
<EOS>
He
fancy
it
tough
,
send
away
his
plate
,
and
have
be
suffer
ever
since
"
.
  
<EOS>
here
be
disappointment
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grant
's
non
-
attendance
be
sad
indeed
.
<EOS>
Her
pleasant
manner
and
cheerful
conformity
make
her
always
valuable
amongst
them
;
but
_
now
_
she
be
absolutely
necessary
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
act
,
they
could
not
rehearse
with
any
satisfaction
without
her
.
<EOS>
the
comfort
of
the
whole
evening
be
destroy
.
<EOS>
what
be
to
be
do
?
<EOS>
Tom
,
as
Cottager
,
be
in
despair
.
<EOS>
after
a
pause
of
perplexity
,
some
eye
begin
to
be
turn
towards
Fanny
,
and
a
voice
or
two
to
say
,
"
if
Miss
Price
would
be
so
good
as
to
<EOS>
_
read
_
the
part
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
immediately
surround
by
supplication
;
everybody
ask
it
;
even
Edmund
say
,
"
do
,
Fanny
,
if
it
be
not
_
very
_
disagreeable
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
Fanny
still
hang
back
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
endure
the
idea
of
it
.
<EOS>
why
be
not
Miss
Crawford
to
be
apply
to
as
well
?
<EOS>
or
why
have
not
she
rather
go
to
her
own
room
,
as
she
have
feel
to
be
safe
,
instead
of
attend
the
rehearsal
at
all
?
<EOS>
She
have
know
it
would
irritate
and
distress
her
;
she
have
know
it
her
duty
to
keep
away
.
<EOS>
She
be
properly
punish
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
only
to
_
read
_
the
part
,
"
say
Henry
Crawford
,
with
renewed
entreaty
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
do
believe
she
can
say
every
word
of
it
,
"
add
Maria
,
"
<EOS>
for
she
could
put
Mrs.
Grant
<EOS>
right
the
other
day
in
twenty
place
.
<EOS>
Fanny
,
I
be
sure
you
know
the
part
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
could
not
say
she
do
_
not
_
;
and
as
they
all
persevere
,
as
Edmund
repeat
his
wish
,
and
with
a
look
of
even
fond
dependence
on
her
good
-
nature
,
she
must
yield
.
<EOS>
She
would
do
her
good
.
<EOS>
everybody
be
satisfied
;
and
she
be
leave
to
the
tremor
of
a
most
palpitating
heart
,
while
the
other
prepare
to
begin
.
  
<EOS>
They
_
do
_
begin
;
and
be
too
much
engage
in
their
own
noise
to
be
strike
by
an
unusual
noise
in
the
other
part
of
the
house
,
<EOS>
have
proceed
some
way
when
the
door
of
the
room
be
throw
open
,
and
Julia
,
appear
at
it
,
with
a
face
all
aghast
,
exclaim
,
"
My
father
be
come
!
<EOS>
He
be
in
the
hall
at
this
moment
.
"
    
<EOS>
how
be
the
consternation
of
the
party
to
be
describe
?
<EOS>
to
the
great
number
it
be
a
moment
of
absolute
horror
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
in
the
house
!
<EOS>
all
feel
the
instantaneous
conviction
.
<EOS>
not
a
hope
of
imposition
or
mistake
be
harbour
anywhere
.
<EOS>
Julia
's
look
be
an
evidence
of
the
fact
that
make
it
indisputable
;
and
after
the
first
start
and
exclamation
,
not
a
word
be
speak
for
half
a
minute
:
each
with
an
alter
countenance
be
look
at
some
other
,
and
almost
each
be
feel
it
a
stroke
the
most
unwelcome
,
most
ill
-
time
,
most
appalling
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Yates
may
consider
it
only
as
a
vexatious
interruption
for
the
evening
,
and
Mr.
Rushworth
may
imagine
it
a
blessing
;
but
every
other
heart
be
sink
under
some
degree
of
self
-
condemnation
or
undefined
alarm
,
every
other
heart
be
suggest
,
"
what
will
become
of
us
?
<EOS>
what
be
to
be
do
now
?
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
terrible
pause
;
and
terrible
to
every
ear
be
the
corroborate
sound
of
opening
door
and
pass
footstep
.
  
<EOS>
Julia
be
the
first
to
move
and
speak
again
.
<EOS>
jealousy
and
bitterness
have
be
suspend
:
selfishness
be
lose
in
the
common
cause
;
but
at
the
moment
of
her
appearance
,
Frederick
be
listen
with
look
of
devotion
to
Agatha
's
narrative
,
and
press
her
hand
to
his
heart
;
and
as
soon
as
she
could
notice
this
,
and
see
that
,
in
spite
of
the
shock
of
her
word
,
he
still
keep
his
station
and
retain
her
sister
's
hand
,
her
wounded
heart
swell
again
with
injury
,
and
look
as
red
as
she
have
be
white
before
,
she
turn
out
of
the
room
,
say
,
"
_
<EOS>
I
_
nee
not
be
afraid
of
appear
before
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
go
rouse
the
rest
;
and
at
the
same
moment
the
two
brother
step
forward
,
feel
the
necessity
of
do
something
.
<EOS>
a
very
few
word
between
them
be
sufficient
.
<EOS>
the
case
admit
no
difference
of
opinion
:
they
must
go
to
the
drawing
-
room
directly
.
<EOS>
Maria
join
them
with
the
same
intent
,
just
then
the
stout
of
the
three
;
for
the
very
circumstance
which
have
drive
Julia
away
be
to
her
the
sweetest
support
.
<EOS>
Henry
Crawford
's
retain
her
hand
at
such
a
moment
,
a
moment
of
such
peculiar
proof
and
importance
,
be
worth
age
of
doubt
and
anxiety
.
<EOS>
She
hail
it
as
an
earnest
of
the
most
serious
determination
,
and
be
equal
even
to
encounter
her
father
.
<EOS>
They
walk
off
,
utterly
heedless
of
Mr.
Rushworth
's
repeated
question
of
,
"
Shall
I
go
too
?
<EOS>
have
not
I
better
go
too
?
<EOS>
Will
not
it
be
right
for
me
to
go
too
?
"
<EOS>
but
they
be
no
sooner
through
the
door
than
Henry
Crawford
undertake
to
answer
the
anxious
inquiry
,
and
,
encourage
him
by
all
mean
to
pay
his
respect
to
Sir
Thomas
without
delay
,
send
him
after
the
other
with
delighted
haste
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
be
leave
with
only
the
Crawfords
and
Mr.
Yates
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
quite
overlook
by
her
cousin
;
and
as
her
own
opinion
of
her
claim
on
Sir
Thomas
's
affection
be
much
too
humble
to
give
her
any
idea
of
class
herself
with
his
child
,
she
be
glad
to
remain
behind
and
gain
a
little
breathing
-
time
.
<EOS>
Her
agitation
and
alarm
exceed
all
that
be
endure
by
the
rest
,
by
the
right
of
a
disposition
which
not
even
innocence
could
keep
from
suffer
.
<EOS>
She
be
nearly
faint
:
all
her
former
habitual
dread
of
her
uncle
be
return
,
and
with
it
compassion
for
him
and
for
almost
every
one
of
the
party
on
the
development
before
him
,
with
solicitude
on
Edmund
's
account
indescribable
.
<EOS>
She
have
find
a
seat
,
where
in
excessive
trembling
she
be
endure
all
these
fearful
thought
,
while
the
other
three
,
no
longer
under
any
restraint
,
be
give
vent
to
their
feeling
of
vexation
,
lament
over
such
an
unlooked
-
for
premature
arrival
as
a
most
untoward
event
,
and
without
mercy
wish
poor
Sir
Thomas
have
be
twice
as
long
on
his
passage
,
or
be
still
in
Antigua
.
  
<EOS>
the
Crawfords
be
more
warm
on
the
subject
than
Mr.
Yates
,
from
well
understand
the
family
,
and
judge
more
clearly
of
the
mischief
that
must
ensue
.
<EOS>
the
ruin
of
the
play
be
to
them
a
certainty
:
they
feel
the
total
destruction
of
the
scheme
to
be
inevitably
at
hand
;
while
Mr.
Yates
consider
it
only
as
a
temporary
interruption
,
a
disaster
for
the
evening
,
and
could
even
suggest
the
possibility
of
the
rehearsal
be
renew
after
tea
,
when
the
bustle
of
receive
Sir
Thomas
be
over
,
and
he
may
be
at
leisure
to
be
amuse
by
it
.
<EOS>
the
Crawfords
laugh
at
the
idea
;
and
have
soon
agree
on
the
propriety
of
their
walking
quietly
home
and
leave
the
family
to
themselves
,
propose
Mr.
Yates
's
accompany
them
and
spend
the
evening
at
the
Parsonage
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Yates
,
have
never
be
with
those
who
think
much
of
parental
claim
,
or
family
confidence
<EOS>
,
could
not
perceive
that
anything
of
the
kind
be
necessary
;
and
therefore
,
thank
them
,
say
,
"
he
prefer
remain
where
he
be
,
that
he
may
pay
his
respect
to
the
old
gentleman
handsomely
since
he
_
be
_
come
;
and
besides
,
he
do
not
think
it
would
be
fair
by
the
other
to
have
everybody
run
away
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
be
just
begin
to
collect
herself
,
and
to
feel
that
if
she
staid
longer
behind
it
may
seem
disrespectful
,
when
this
point
be
settle
,
and
be
commission
with
the
brother
and
sister
's
apology
,
see
them
prepare
to
go
as
she
quit
the
room
herself
to
perform
the
dreadful
duty
of
appear
before
her
uncle

<EOS>
too
soon
do
she
find
herself
at
the
drawing
-
room
door
;
and
after
pause
a
moment
for
what
she
know
would
not
come
,
for
a
courage
which
the
outside
of
no
door
have
ever
supply
to
her
<EOS>
,
she
turn
the
lock
in
desperation
,
and
the
light
of
the
drawing

room
,
and
all
the
collect
family
,
be
before
her
.
<EOS>
as
she
enter
,
her
own

catch
her
ear
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
be
at
that
moment
look
round
him
,
and
say
,
"
<EOS>
but
where
be
Fanny
?
<EOS>
why
do
not
I
see
my
little
Fanny
?
<EOS>
"
 
and
on
perceive
her
,
come
forward
with
a
kindness
which
astonish
and
penetrate
her
,
call
her
his
dear
Fanny
,
kiss
her
affectionately
,
and
observe
with
decide
pleasure
how
much
she
be
grow
!
<EOS>
Fanny
know
not
how
to
feel
,
nor
where
to
look
.
<EOS>
She
be
quite
oppress
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
be
so
kind
,
so
_
very
_
kind
to
her
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
His
manner
seem
change
,
his
voice
be
quick
from
the
agitation
of
joy
;
and
all
that
have
be
awful
in
his
dignity
seem
lose
in
tenderness
.
<EOS>
He
lead
her
nearer
the
light
and
look
at
her
again
 
inquire
particularly
after
her
health
,
and
then
,
correct
himself
,
observe
that
he
need
not
inquire
,
for
her
appearance
speak
sufficiently
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
a
fine
blush
have
succeed
the
previous
paleness
of
her
face
,
he
be
justified
in
his
belief
of
her
equal
improvement
in
health
and
beauty
.
<EOS>
He
inquire
next
after
her
family
,
especially
William
:
and
his
kindness
altogether
be
such
as
make
her
reproach
herself
for
love
him
so
little
,
and
think
his
return
a
misfortune
;
and
when
,
on
have
courage
to
lift
her
eye
to
his
face
,
she
see
that
he
be
grow
thin
,
and
have
the
burn
,
fag
,
worn
look
of
fatigue
and
a
hot
climate
,
every
tender
feeling
be
increase
,
and
she
be
miserable
in
consider
how
much
unsuspected
vexation
be
probably
ready
to
burst
on
him
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
be
indeed
the
life
of
the
party
,
who
at
his
suggestion
now
seat
themselves
round
the
fire
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
good
right
to
be
the
talker
;
and
the
delight
of
his
sensation
in
be
again
in
his
own
house
,
in
the
centre
of
his
family
,
after
such
a
separation
,
make
him
communicative
and
chatty
in
a
very
unusual
degree
;
and
he
be
ready
to
give
every
information
as
to
his
voyage
,
and
answer
every
question
of
his
two
son
almost
before
it
be
put

<EOS>
His
business
in
Antigua
have
latterly
be
prosperously
rapid
,
and
he
come
directly
from
Liverpool
,
have
have
an
opportunity
of
make
his
passage
thither
in
a
private
vessel
,
instead
of
wait
for
the
packet

and
all
the
little
particular
of
his
proceeding
and
event
,
his
arrival
and
departure
,
be
most
promptly

as

Lady
Bertram
and

with
heartfelt
satisfaction
on

interrupt
himself
more
than
once

to
remark
on
his
good
fortune
in

come
unexpectedly
as
he

all
collect
together
exactly
as
he

Mr.

already

him

and
with
pointed
attention
he
be

with
Mansfield

<EOS>
there
be
nothing
disagreeable
in
Mr.
Rushworth
's
appearance
,
and
Sir
Thomas
be
like
him
already
.
  
<EOS>
by
not
one

to
with
such
unbroken
,
unalloyed
enjoyment
as
by
his
wife
,
who
be
really
extremely
happy
to
see
him
,
and
whose
feeling
be
so
warm
by
his
sudden
arrival
as
to
place
her
nearer
agitation
than
she
have
be
for
the
last
twenty
year
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
_
<EOS>
almost
_
flutter
for
a
few
minute
,
and
still
remain
so
sensibly
animate
as
to
put
away
her
work
,
move
Pug
from
her
side
,
and
give
all
her
attention
and
all
the
rest
of
her
sofa
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
anxiety
for
anybody
to
cloud
_
<EOS>
her
_
pleasure
<EOS>
:
her
own
time
have
be
irreproachably
spend
during
his
absence
:
she
have
do
a
great
deal
of
carpet
-
work
,
and
make
many
yard
of
fringe
;
and
she
would
have
answer
as
freely
for
the
good
conduct
and
useful
pursuit
of
all
the
young
people
as
for
her
own
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
agreeable
to
her
to
see
him
again
,
and
hear
him
talk
,
to
have
her
ear
amuse
and
her
whole
comprehension
fill
by
his
narrative
,
that
she
begin
particularly
to
feel
how
dreadfully
she
must
have
miss
him
,
and
how
impossible
it
would
have
be
for
her
to
bear
a
lengthen
absence
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
be
by
no
means
to

compare
in
happiness
to
her
sister

<EOS>
not
that
_
she
_
be
incommode
by
many
fear
of
Sir
Thomas
's
disapprobation
when
the
present
state
of
his
house
should
be
know
,
for
her
judgment
have
be
so
blind
that
,
except
by
the
instinctive
caution
with
which
she
have
whisk
away
Mr.
Rushworth
's
pink
satin
cloak
as
her
brother
-
in

law
enter
,
she
could
hardly
be
say
to
shew
any
sign
of
alarm
;
but
she
be
vex
by
the
_
manner
_
of
his
return
.
<EOS>
It
have
leave
her
nothing
to
do
.
<EOS>
instead
of
be
send
for
out
of
the
room
,
and
see
him
first
,
and
have
to
spread
the
happy
news
through
the
house
,
Sir
Thomas
,
with
a
very
reasonable
dependence
,
perhaps
,
on
the
nerve
of
his
wife
and
child
,
have
seek
no
confidant
but
the
butler
,
and
have
be
follow
him
almost
instantaneously
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
feel
herself
defraud
of
an
office
on
which
she
have
always
depend
,
whether
his
arrival
or
his
death
be
to
be
the
thing
unfold
;
and
be
now
try
to
be
in
a
bustle
without
have
anything
to
bustle
about
,
and
labour
to
be
important
where
nothing
be
want
but
tranquillity
and
silence
.
<EOS>
Would
Sir
Thomas
have
consent
to
eat
,
she
may
have
go
to
the
housekeeper
with
troublesome
direction
,
and
insult
the
footman
with
injunction
of
despatch
;
but
Sir
Thomas
resolutely
decline
all
dinner
:
he
would
take
nothing
,
nothing
till
tea
come
 
he
would
rather
wait
for
tea
.
<EOS>
still
Mrs.
Norris
be
at
interval
urge
something
different
;
and
in
the
most
interesting
moment
of
his
passage
to
England
,
when
the
alarm
of
a
french
privateer
be
at
the
height
,
she
burst
through
his
recital
with
the
proposal
of
soup
.
<EOS>
"
sure
,
my
dear
Sir
Thomas
,
a
basin
of
soup
would
be
a
much
well
thing
for
you
than
tea
.
<EOS>
do
have
a
basin
of
soup
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
could
not
be
provoke
.
"
<EOS>
still
the
same
anxiety
for
everybody
's
comfort
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Norris
,
"
be
his
answer
.
"
<EOS>
but
indeed
I
would
rather
have
nothing
but
tea
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
Lady
Bertram
,
suppose
you
speak
for
tea
directly
;
suppose
you
hurry
Baddeley
a
little
;
he
seem
behindhand
to
-
night
.
"
<EOS>
She
carry
this
point
,
and
Sir
Thomas
's
narrative
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
there
be
a
pause
.
<EOS>
His
immediate
communication
be
exhaust
,
and
it
seem
enough
to
be
look
joyfully
around
him
,
now
at
one
,
now
at
another
of
the
beloved
circle
;
but
the
pause
be
not
long
:
in
the
elation
of
her
spirit
Lady
Bertram
become
talkative
,
and
what
be
the
sensation
of
her
child
upon
hear
her
say
,
"
how
do
you
think
the
young
people
have
be
amuse
themselves
lately
,
Sir
Thomas
?
<EOS>
They
have
be
act
.
<EOS>
We
have
be
all
alive
with
act

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
indeed
!
<EOS>
and
what
have
you
be
act
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
they
will
tell
you
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
_
all
_
will
soon
be
tell
,
"
cry
Tom
hastily
,
and
with
affect
unconcern
;
"
but
it
be
not
worth
while
to
bore
my
father
with
it
now
.
<EOS>
You
will
hear
enough
of
it
to
-
morrow
,
sir
.
<EOS>
We
have
just
be
try
,
by
way
of
do
something
,
and
amuse
my
mother
,
just
within
the
last
week
,
to
get
up
a
few
scene
,
a
mere
trifle
.
<EOS>
We
have
have
such
incessant
rain
almost
since
October
begin
,
that
we
have
be
nearly
confine
to
the
house
for
day
together
.
<EOS>
I
have
hardly
take
out
a
gun
since
the
3rd
.
<EOS>
tolerable
sport
the
first
three
day
,
but
there
have
be
no
attempt
anything
since
.
<EOS>
the
first
day
I
go
over
Mansfield
Wood
,
and
Edmund
take
the
copse
beyond
Easton
,
and
we
bring
home
six
brace
between
us
,
and
may
each
have
kill
six
time
as
many
,
but
we
respect
your
pheasant
<EOS>
,
sir
,
I
assure
you
,
as
much
as
you
could
desire
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
you
will
find
your
wood
by
any
mean
worse
stock
than
they
be
.
<EOS>
_
I
_
never
see
Mansfield
Wood
so
full
of
pheasant
in
my
life
as
this
year
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
take
a
day
's
sport
there
yourself
,
sir
,
soon
.
"
  
<EOS>
for
the
present
the
danger
be
over
,
and
Fanny
's
sick
feeling
subside
;
but
when
tea
be
soon
afterwards
bring
in
,
and
Sir
Thomas
,
get
up
,
say
that
he
find
that
he
could
not
be
any
longer
in
the
house
without
just
look
into
his
own
dear
room
,
every
agitation
be
return
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
before
anything
have
be
say
to
prepare
him
for
the
change
he
must
find
there
;
and
a
pause
of
alarm
follow
his
disappearance
.
<EOS>
Edmund
be
the
first
to
speak
    
<EOS>
"
something
must
be
do
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
time
to
think
of
our
visitor
,
"
say
Maria
,
still
feel
her
hand
press
to
Henry
Crawford
's
heart
,
and
care
little
for
anything
else

<EOS>
"
where
do
you
leave
Miss
Crawford
,
Fanny
?
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
tell
of
their
departure
,
and
deliver
their
message
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
poor
Yates
be
all
alone
,
"
cry
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
and
fetch
him
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
no
bad
assistant
when
it
all
come
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
to
the
theatre
he
go
,
and
reach
it
just
in
time
to
witness
the
first
meeting
of
his
father
and
his
friend
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
have
be
a
good
deal
surprise
to
find
candle
burn
in
his
room
;
and
on
cast
his
eye
round
it
,
to
see
other
symptom
of
recent
habitation
and
a
general
air
of
confusion
in
the
furniture
.
<EOS>
the
removal
of
the
bookcase
from
before
the
billiard
-
room
door
strike
him
especially
,
but
he
have
scarcely
more
than
time
to
feel
astonished
at
all
this
,
before
there
be
sound
from
the
billiard
-
room
to
astonish
him
still
farther
.
<EOS>
some
one
be
talk
there
in
a
very
loud
accent
;
he
do
not
know
the
voice
 
more
than
talk
 
almost
halloo
.
<EOS>
He
step
to
the
door
,
rejoice
at
that
moment
in
have
the
mean
of
immediate
communication
,
and
,
open
it
,
find
himself
on
the
stage
of
a
theatre
,
and
oppose
to
a
rant
young
man
,
who
appear
likely
to
knock
him
down
backwards
.
<EOS>
at
the
very
moment
of
Yates
perceive
Sir
Thomas
,
and
give
perhaps
the
very
good
start
he
have
ever
give
in
the
whole
course
of
his
rehearsal
,
Tom
Bertram
enter
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
;
and
never
have
he
find
great
difficulty
in
keep
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
His
father
's
look
of
solemnity
and
amazement
on
this
his
first
appearance
on
any
stage
,
and
the
gradual
metamorphosis
of
the
impassioned
Baron
Wildenheim
into
the
well
-
breed
and
easy
Mr.
Yates
,
make
his
bow
and
apology
to
Sir
Thomas
Bertram
,
be
such
an
exhibition
,
such
a
piece
of
true
acting
,
as
he
would
not
have
lose
upon
any
account
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
the
last
 
in
all
probability
 
the
last
scene
on
that
stage
;
but
he
be
sure
there
could
not
be
a
fine
.
<EOS>
the
house
would
close
with
the
great
eclat
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
little
time
,
however
,
for
the
indulgence
of
any
image
of
merriment
.
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
for
him
to
step
forward
,
too
,
and
assist
the
introduction
,
and
with
many
awkward
sensation
he
do
his
good
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
receive
Mr.
Yates
with
all
the
appearance
of
cordiality
which
be
due
to
his
own
character
,
but
be
really
as
far
from
pleased
with
the
necessity
of
the
acquaintance
as
with
the
manner
of
its
commencement
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Yates
's
family
and
connexion
be
sufficiently
know
to
him
to
render
his
introduction
as
the
"
particular
friend
,
"
another
of
the
hundred
particular
friend
of
his
son
,
exceedingly
unwelcome
;
and
it
need
all
the
felicity
of
be
again
at
home
,
and
all
the
forbearance
it
could
supply
,
to
save
Sir
Thomas
from
anger
on
find
himself
thus
bewilder
in
his
own
house
,
make
part
of
a
ridiculous
exhibition
in
the
midst
of
theatrical
nonsense
,
and
force
in
so
untoward
a
moment
to
admit
the
acquaintance
of
a
young
man
whom
he
feel
sure
of
disapproving
,
and
whose
easy
indifference
and
volubility
in
the
course
of
the
first
five
minute
seem
to
mark
him
the
most
at
home
of
the
two
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
understand
his
father
's
thought
,
and
heartily
wish
he
may
be
always
as
well
disposed
to
give
them
but
partial
expression
,
begin
to
see
,
more
clearly
than
he
have
ever
do
before
,
that
there
may
be
some
ground
of
offence
,
that
there
may
be
some
reason
for
the
glance
his
father
give
towards
the
ceiling
and
stucco
of
the
room
;
and
that
when
he
inquire
with
mild
gravity
after
the
fate
of
the
billiard
-
table
,
he
be
not
proceed
beyond
a
very
allowable
curiosity
.
<EOS>
a
few
minute
be
enough
for
such
unsatisfactory
sensation
on
each
side
;
and
Sir
Thomas
have
exert
himself
so
far
as
to
speak
a
few
word
of
calm
approbation
in
reply
to
an
eager
appeal
of
Mr.
Yates
,
as
to
the
happiness
of
the
arrangement
,
the
three
gentleman
return
to
the
drawing
-
room
together
,
Sir
Thomas
with
an
increase
of
gravity
which
be
not
lose
on
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
come
from
your
theatre
,
"
say
he
composedly
,
as
he
sit
down
;

I
find
myself
in
it
rather
unexpectedly

Its
vicinity
to
my
own
room
 
<EOS>
but
in
every
respect
,
indeed
,
it
take
me
by
surprise
,
as
I
have
not
the
small
suspicion
of
your
acting
have
assume
so
serious
a
character
.
<EOS>
It
appear
a
neat
job
,
however
,
as
far
as
I
could
judge
by
candlelight
,
and
do
my
friend
Christopher
Jackson
credit
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
he
would
have
change
the
subject
,
and
sip
his
coffee
in
peace
over
domestic
matter
of
a
calm
hue
;
but
Mr.
Yates
,
without
discernment
to
catch
Sir
Thomas
's
meaning
,
or
diffidence
,
or
delicacy
,
or
discretion
enough
to
allow
him
to
lead
the
discourse
while
he
mingle
among
the
other
with
the
least
obtrusiveness
himself
,
would
keep
him
on
the
topic
of
the
theatre
,
would
torment
him
with
question
and
remark
relative
to
it
,
and
finally
would
make
him
hear
the
whole
history
of
his
disappointment
at
Ecclesford
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
listen
most
politely
,
but
find
much
to
offend
his
idea
of
decorum
,
and
confirm
his
ill
-
opinion
of
Mr.
Yates
's
habit
of
thinking
,
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
story
;
and
when
it
be
over
,
could
give
him
no
other
assurance
of
sympathy
than
what
a
slight
bow
convey
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
,
in
fact
,
the
origin
of
_
our
_
acting
,
"
say
Tom
,
after
a
moment
's
thought
.
<EOS>
"
My
friend
Yates
bring
the
infection
from
Ecclesford
,
and
it
spread
 
as
those
thing
always
spread
,
you
know
,
sir
 
<EOS>
the
faster
,
probably
,
from
_
your

have
so
often
encourage
the
sort
of
thing
in
us
formerly
.
<EOS>
It
be
like
tread
old
ground
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Yates
take
the
subject
from
his
friend
as
soon
as
possible
,
and
immediately
give
Sir
Thomas
an
account
of
what
they
have
do
and
be
do
:
tell
him
of
the
gradual
increase
of
their
view
,
the
happy
conclusion
of
their
first
difficulty
,
and
present
promising
state
of
affair
;
relate
everything
with
so
blind
an
interest
as
make
him
not
only
totally
unconscious
of
the
uneasy
movement
of
many
of
his
friend
as
they
sit
,
the
change
of
countenance
,
the
fidget
,
the
hem
!
<EOS>
of
unquietness
,
but
prevent
him
even
from
see
the
expression
of
the
face
on
which
his
own
eye
be
fix
 
from
see
Sir
Thomas
's
dark
brow
contract
as
he
look
with
inquire
earnestness
at
his
daughter
and
Edmund
,
dwell
particularly
on
the
latter
,
and
speak
a
language
,
a
remonstrance
,
a
reproof
,
which
_
<EOS>
he
_
feel
at
his
heart
.
<EOS>
not
less
acutely
be
it
feel
by
Fanny
,
who
have
edge
back
her
chair
behind
her
aunt
's
end
of
the
sofa
,
and
,
screen
from
notice
herself
,
see
all
that
be
pass
before
her
.
<EOS>
such
a
look
of
reproach
at
Edmund
from
his
father
<EOS>
she
could
never
have
expect
to
witness
;
and
to
feel
that
it
be
in
any
degree
deserve
<EOS>
be
an
aggravation
indeed
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
's
look
imply
,
"
on
your
judgment
,
Edmund
,
I
depend
;
what
have
you
be
about
?
"
<EOS>
She
knelt
in
spirit
to
her
uncle
,
and
her
bosom
swell
to
utter
,
"
oh
,
not

him

<EOS>
look
so
to
all
the

not

him

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Yates
be
still
talk
.
<EOS>
"
to
own
the
truth
,
Sir
Thomas
,
we
be
in
the
middle
of
a
rehearsal
when
you
arrive
this
evening
.
<EOS>
We
be
go
through
the
three
first
act
,
and
not
unsuccessfully
upon
the
whole
.
<EOS>
Our
company
be
now
so
disperse
,
from
the
Crawfords
be
go
home
,
that
nothing
more
can
be
do
to
-
night
;
but
if
you
will
give
us
the
honour
of
your
company
to
-
morrow
evening
,
I
should
not
be
afraid
of
the
result

<EOS>
We
bespeak
your
indulgence
,
you
understand
,
as
young
performer
;
we
bespeak
your
indulgence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
indulgence
shall
be
give
,
sir

"
reply
Sir
Thomas
gravely
,
"
but
without
any
other
rehearsal
.
"
<EOS>
and
with
a
relent
smile
,
he
add
,
"
I
come
home
to
be
happy
and
indulgent
.
"
<EOS>
then
turn
away
towards
any
or
all
of
the
rest
,
he
tranquilly
say
,
"
Mr.

Miss
Crawford
be
mention
in
my
last
letter
from
Mansfield

do
you
find
them
agreeable
acquaintance
?

"
  
<EOS>
Tom
be
the
only
one
at
all
ready
with
an
answer
,
but
he
be
entirely
without
particular
regard
for
either
,
without
jealousy
either
in
love
or
acting
,
could
speak
very
handsomely
of
both
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Crawford
be
a
most
pleasant
,
gentleman
-
like
man
;
his
sister
a
sweet
,
pretty
,
elegant
,
lively
girl
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rushworth
could
be
silent
no
longer
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
say
he
be
not
gentleman
-
like
,
consider
;
but
you
should
tell
your
father
he
be
not
above
five
foot
eight
,
or
he
will
be
expect
a
well
-
looking
man

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
do
not
quite
understand
this
,
and
look
with
some
surprise
at
the
speaker
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
must
say
what
I
think
,
"
continue
Mr.
Rushworth
,
"
in
my
opinion
it
be
very
disagreeable
to
be
always
rehearse
.
<EOS>
It
be
have
too
much
of
a
good
thing
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
so
fond
of
act
as
I
be
at
first
.
<EOS>
I
think
we
be
a
great
deal
better
employ
,
sit
comfortably
here
among
ourselves
,
and
do
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
look
again
,
and
then
reply
with
an
approve
smile
,
"
I
be
happy
to
find
our
sentiment
on
this
subject
so
much
the
same
.
<EOS>
It
give
me
sincere
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
that
I
should
be
cautious
and
quick
-
sighted
,
and
feel
many
scruple
which
my
child
do
_
not
_
feel
,
be
perfectly
natural
;
and
equally
so
that
my
value
for
domestic
tranquillity
,
for
a
home
which
shut
out
noisy
pleasure
,
should
much
exceed
theirs
.
<EOS>
but
at
your
time
of
life
to
feel
all
this
,
be
a
most
favourable
circumstance
for
yourself
,
and
for
everybody
connect
with
you
;
and
I
be
sensible
of
the
importance
of
have
an
ally
of
such
weight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
mean
to
be
give
Mr.
Rushworth
's
opinion
in
well
word
than
he
could
find
himself
.
<EOS>
He
be
aware
that
he
must
not
expect
a
genius
in
Mr.
Rushworth
;
but
as
a
well
-
judge
,
steady
young
man
,
with
well
notion
than
his
elocution
would
do
justice
to
,
he
intend
to
value
him
very
highly
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
many
of
the
other
not
to
smile
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rushworth
hardly
know
what
to
do
with
so
much
meaning
;
but
by
look
,
as
he
really
feel
,
most
exceedingly
pleased
with
Sir
Thomas
's
good
opinion
,
and
say
scarcely
anything
,
he
do
his
good
towards
preserve
that
good
opinion
a
little
longer
.
    
<EOS>
Edmund
's
first
object
the
next
morning
be
to
see
his
father
alone
,
and
give
him
a
fair
statement
of
the
whole
acting
scheme
,
defend
his
own
share
in
it
as
far
only
as
he
could
then
,
in
a
soberer
moment
,
feel
his
motive
to
deserve
,
and
acknowledge
,
with
perfect
ingenuousness
,
that
his
concession
have
be
attend
with
such
partial
good
as
to
make
his
judgment
in
it
very
doubtful
.
<EOS>
He
be
anxious
,
while
vindicate
himself
,
to
say
nothing
unkind
of
the
other
:
but
there
be
only
one
amongst
them
whose
conduct
he
could
mention
without
some
necessity
of
defence
or
palliation
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
all
be
more
or
less
to
blame
,
"
say
he
,
"
every
one
of
us
,
except
Fanny
.
<EOS>
Fanny
be
the
only
one
who
have
judge
rightly
throughout
;
who
have
be
consistent
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Her
_
feeling
have
be
steadily
against
it
from
first
to
last
.
<EOS>
She
never
cease
to
think
of
what
be
due
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
Fanny
everything
you
could
wish
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
see
all
the
impropriety
of
such
a
scheme
among
such
a
party
,
and
at
such
a
time
,
as
strongly
as
his
son
have
ever
suppose
he
must
;
he
feel
it
too
much
,
indeed
,
for
many
word
;
and
have
shake
hand
with
Edmund
,
mean
to
try
to
lose
the
disagreeable
impression
,
and
forget
how
much
he
have
be
forget
himself
as
soon
as
he
could
,
after
the
house
have
be
clear
of
every
object
enforce
the
remembrance
,
and
restore
to
its
proper
state
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
enter
into
any
remonstrance
with
his
other
child
:
he
be
more
willing
to
believe
they
feel
their
error
than
to
run
the
risk
of
investigation
.
<EOS>
the
reproof
of
an
immediate
conclusion
of
everything
,
the
sweep
of
every
preparation
,
would
be
sufficient
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
one
person
,
however
,
in
the
house
,
whom
he
could
not
leave
to
learn
his
sentiment
merely
through
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
help
give
Mrs.
Norris
a
hint
of
his
have
hope
that
her
advice
may
have
be
interpose
to
prevent
what
her
judgment
must
certainly
have
disapprove
.
<EOS>
the
young
people
have
be
very
inconsiderate
in
form
the
plan
;
they
ought
to
have
be
capable
of
a
well
decision
themselves
;
but
they
be
young
;
and
,
except
Edmund
,
he
believe
,
of
unsteady
character
;
and
with
great
surprise
,
therefore
,
he
must
regard
her
acquiescence
in
their
wrong
measure
,
her
countenance
of
their
unsafe
amusement
,
than
that
such
measure
and
such
amusement
should
have
be
suggest
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
be
a
little
confounded
and
<EOS>
as
nearly
be
silence
as
ever
she
have
be
in
her
life
;
for
she
be
ashamed
to
confess
have
never
see
any
of
the
impropriety
which
be
so
glare
to
Sir
Thomas
,
and
would
not
have
admit
that
her
influence
be
insufficient
 
that
she
may
have
talk
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Her
only
resource
be
to
get
out
of
the
subject
as
fast
as
possible
,
and
turn
the
current
of
Sir
Thomas
's
idea
into
a
happy
channel
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
great
deal
to
insinuate
in
her
own
praise
as
to
_
general
_
attention
to
the
interest
and
comfort
of
his
family
,
much
exertion
and
many
sacrifice
to
glance
at
in
the
form
of
hurried
walk
and
sudden
removal
from
her
own
fireside
,
and
many
excellent
hint
of
distrust
and
economy
to
Lady
Bertram
and
Edmund
to
detail
,
whereby
a
most
considerable
saving
have
always
arise
,
and
more
than
one
bad
servant
be
detect
.
<EOS>
but
her
chief
strength
lie
in
Sotherton
.
<EOS>
Her
great
support
and
glory
be
in
have
form
the
connexion
with
the
rushworth
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
there
_
<EOS>
she
be
impregnable
.
<EOS>
She
take
to
herself
all
the
credit
of
bring
Mr.
Rushworth
's
admiration
of
Maria
to
any
effect
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
have
not
be
active
,
"
say
she
,
"
and
make
a
point
of
be
introduce
to
his
mother
,
and
then
prevail
on
my
sister
to
pay
the
first
visit
,
I
be
as
certain
as
I
sit
here
that
nothing
would
have
come
of
it
;
for
Mr.
Rushworth
be
the
sort
of
amiable
modest
young
man
who
want
a
great
deal
of
encouragement
,
and
there
be
girl
enough
on
the
catch
for
him
if
we
have
be
idle
.
<EOS>
but
I
leave
no
stone
unturned
.
<EOS>
I
be
ready
to
move
heaven
and
earth
to
persuade
my
sister
,
and
at
last
I
do
persuade
her
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
distance
to
Sotherton
;
it
be
in
the
middle
of
winter
,
and
the
road
almost
impassable
,
but
I
do
persuade
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
how
great
,
how
justly
great
,
your
influence
be
with
Lady
Bertram
and
her
child
,
and
be
the
more
concerned
that
it
should
not
have
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Sir
Thomas
,
if
you
have
see
the
state
of
the
road
_
<EOS>
that
_
day
!
<EOS>
I
think
we
should
never
have
get
through
them
,
though
we
have
the
four
horse
of
course
;
and
poor
old
coachman
would
attend
us
,
out
of
his
great
love
and
kindness
,
though
he
be
hardly
able
to
sit
the
box
on
account
of
the
rheumatism
which
I
have
be
doctor
him
for
ever
since
Michaelmas
.
<EOS>
I
cure
him
at
last
;
but
he
be
very
bad
all
the
winter
 
<EOS>
and
this
be
such
a
day
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
help
go
to
him
up
in
his
room
before
we
set
off
to
advise
him
not
to
venture
:
he
be
put
on
his
wig
;
so
I
say
,
"
Coachman
,
you
have
much
well
not
go
;
your
Lady
and
I
shall
be
very
safe
;
you
know
how
steady
Stephen
be
,
and
Charles
have
be
upon
the
leader
so
often
now
,
that
I
be
sure
there
be
no
fear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
I
soon
find
it
would
not
do
;
he
be
bent
upon
go
,
and
as
I
hate
to
be
worrying
and
officious
,
I
say
no
more
;
but
my
heart
quite
ache
for
him
at
every
jolt
,
and
when
we
get
into
the
rough
lane
about
Stoke
,
<EOS>
where
,
what
with
frost
and
snow
upon
bed
of
stone
,
it
be
bad
than
anything
you
can
imagine
,
I
be
quite
in
an
agony
about
him
.
<EOS>
and
then
the
poor
horse
too
!
<EOS>
to
see
them
strain
away
!
<EOS>
You
know
how
I
always
feel
for
the
horse
.
<EOS>
and
when
we
get
to
the
bottom
of
Sandcroft
Hill
,
what
do
you
think
I
do
?
<EOS>
You
will
laugh
at
me
;
but
I
get
out
and
walk
up
.
<EOS>
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
It
may
not
be
save
them
much
,
but
it
be
something
,
and
I
could
not
bear
to
sit
at
my
ease
and
be
drag
up
at
the
expense
of
those
noble
animal
.
<EOS>
I
catch
a
dreadful
cold
,
but
_
<EOS>
that
_
I
do
not
regard
.
<EOS>
My
object
be
accomplish
in
the
visit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
we
shall
always
think
the
acquaintance
worth
any
trouble
that
may
be
take
to
establish
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
very
striking
in
Mr.
Rushworth
's
manner
,
but
I
be
pleased
last
night
with
what
appear
to
be
his
opinion
on
one
subject
:
his
decide
preference
of
a
quiet
family
party
to
the
bustle
and
confusion
of
acting
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
feel
exactly
as
one
could
wish
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
indeed
,
and
the
more
you
know
of
him
the
better
you
will
like
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
shine
character
,
but
he
have
a
thousand
good
quality
;
and
be
so
disposed
to
look
up
to
you
,
that
I
be
quite
laugh
at
about
it
,
for
everybody
consider
it
as
my
doing
.
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
Mrs.
Norris
,
"
say
Mrs.
Grant
the
other
day
,
"
if
Mr.
Rushworth
be
a
son
of
your
own
,
he
could
not
hold
Sir
Thomas
in
great
respect
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
give
up
the
point
,
foil
by
her
evasion
,
disarm
by
her
flattery
;
and
be
oblige
to
rest
satisfied
with
the
conviction
that
where
the
present
pleasure
of
those
she
love
be
at
stake
,
her
kindness
do
sometimes
overpower
her
judgment
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
busy
morning
with
him
.
<EOS>
conversation
with
any
of
them
occupy
but
a
small
part
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
to
reinstate
himself
in
all
the
wonte
concern
of
his
Mansfield
life
:
to
see
his
steward
and
his
bailiff
;
to
examine
and
compute
,
and
,
in
the
interval
of
business
,
to
walk
into
his
stable
and
his
garden
,
and
near
plantation
;
but
active
and
methodical
,
he
have
not
only
do
all
this
before
he
resume
his
seat
as
master
of
the
house
at
dinner
,
he
have
also
set
the
carpenter
to
work
in
pull
down
what
have
be
so
lately
put
up
in
the
billiard
-
room
,
and
give
the
scene
-
painter
his
dismissal
long
enough
to
justify
the
pleasing
belief
of
his
be
then
at
least
as
far
off
as
Northampton
.
<EOS>
the
scene
-
painter
be
go
,
have
spoil
only
the
floor
of
one
room
,
ruin
all
the
coachman
's
sponge
,
and
make
five
of
the
under
-
servant
idle
and
dissatisfied
;
and
Sir
Thomas
be
in
hope
that
another
day
or
two
would
suffice
to
wipe
away
every
outward
memento
of
what
have
be
,
even
to
the
destruction
of
every
unbound
copy
of
Lovers
'
vow
in
the
house
,
for
he
be
burn
all
that
meet
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Yates
be
begin
now
to
understand
Sir
Thomas
's
intention
,
though
as
far
as
ever
from
understand
their
source
.
<EOS>
He
and
his
friend
have
be
out
with
their
gun
the
chief
of
the
morning
,
and
Tom
have
take
the
opportunity
of
explain
,
with
proper
apology
for
his
father
's
particularity
,
what
be
to
be
expect
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Yates
feel
it
as
acutely
as
may
be
suppose
.
<EOS>
to
be
a
second
time
disappoint
in
the
same
way
be
an
instance
of
very
severe
ill
-
luck
;
and
his
indignation
be
such
,
that
have
it
not
be
for
delicacy
towards
his
friend
,
and
his
friend
's
young
sister
,
he
believe
he
should
certainly
attack
the
baronet
on
the
absurdity
of
his
proceeding
,
and
argue
him
into
a
little
more
rationality
.
<EOS>
He
believe
this
very
stoutly
while
he
be
in
Mansfield
Wood
,
and
all
the
way
home
;
but
there
be
a
something
in
Sir
Thomas
,
when
they
sit
round
the
same
table
,
which
make
Mr.
Yates
think
it
wiser
to
let
him
pursue
his
own
way
,
and
feel
the
folly
of
it
without
opposition
.
<EOS>
He
have
know
many
disagreeable
father
before
,
and
often
be
strike
with
the
inconvenience
they
occasion
,
but
never
,
in
the
whole
course
of
his
life
,
have
he
see
one
of
that
class
so
unintelligibly
moral
,
so
infamously
tyrannical
as
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
man
to
be
endure
but
for
his
child
's
sake
,
and
he
may
be
thankful
to
his
fair
daughter
Julia
that
Mr.
Yates
do
yet
mean
to
stay
a
few
day
longer
under
his
roof
.
  
<EOS>
the
evening
pass
with
external
smoothness
,
though
almost
every
mind
be
ruffle
;
and
the
music
which
Sir
Thomas
call
for
from
his
daughter
help
to
conceal
the
want
of
real
harmony
.
<EOS>
Maria
be
in
a
good
deal
of
agitation
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
the
utmost
consequence
to
her
that
Crawford
should
now
lose
no
time
in
declare
himself
,
and
she
be
disturb
that
even
a
day
should
be
go
by
without
seem
to
advance
that
point
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
expect
to
see
him
the
whole
morning
,
and
all
the
evening
,
too
,
be
still
expect
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rushworth
have
set
off
early
with
the
great
news
for
Sotherton
;
and
she
have
fondly
hope
for
such
an
immediate
_
eclaircissement
_
as
may
save
him
the
trouble
of
ever
come
back
again
.
<EOS>
but
they
have
see
no
one
from
the
Parsonage
,
not
a
creature
,
and
have
hear
no
tiding
beyond
a
friendly
note
of
congratulation
and
inquiry
from
Mrs.
Grant
to
Lady
Bertram
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
day
for
many
,
many
week
,
in
which
the
family
have
be
wholly
divide
.
<EOS>
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
have
never
pass
before
,
since
August
begin
,
without
bring
them
together
in
some
way
or
other
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
sad
,
anxious
day
;
and
the
morrow
,
though
differ
in
the
sort
of
evil
,
do
by
no
mean
bring
less
.
<EOS>
a
few
moment
of
feverish
enjoyment
be
follow
by
hour
of
acute
suffering
.
<EOS>
Henry
Crawford
be
again
in
the
house
:
he
walk
up
with
Dr.
Grant
,
who
be
anxious
to
pay
his
respect
to
Sir
Thomas
,
and
at
rather
an
early
hour
they
be
usher
into
the
breakfast
-
room
,
where
be
most
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
soon
appear
,
and
Maria
see
with
delight
and
agitation
<EOS>
the
introduction
of
the
man
she
love
to
her
father
.
<EOS>
Her
sensation
be
indefinable
,
and
so
be
they
<EOS>
a
few
minute
afterwards
upon
hear
Henry
Crawford
,
who
have
a
chair
between
herself
and
Tom
,
ask
the
latter
in
an
undervoice
whether
there
be
any
plan
for
resume
the
play
after
the
present
happy
interruption
(
with
a
courteous
glance
at
Sir
Thomas
)
,
because
,
in
that
case
,
he
should
make
a
point
of
return
to
Mansfield
at
any
time
require
by
the
party
:
he
be
go
away
immediately
,
be
to
meet
his
uncle
at
Bath
without
delay
;
but
if
there
be
any
prospect
of
a
renewal
of
Lovers
'
vow
,
he
should
hold
himself
positively
engage
,
he
should
break
through
every
other
claim
,
he
should
absolutely
condition
with
his
uncle
for
attend
them
whenever
he
may
be
want
.
<EOS>
the
play
should
not
be
lose
by
_
his
_
absence
.
  
<EOS>
"
from
Bath
,
Norfolk
,
London
,
York
,
wherever
I
may
be
,
"
say
he
;
"
I
will
attend
you
from
any
place
in
England
,
at
an
hour
's
notice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
well
at
that
moment
that
Tom
have
to
speak
,
and
not
his
sister
.
<EOS>
He
could
immediately
say
with
easy
fluency
,
"
I
be
sorry
you
be
go
;
but
as
to
our
play
,
_
that
_
be
all
over
 
entirely
at
an
end
"
(
look
significantly
at
his
father
)
.
<EOS>
"
the
painter
be
send
off
yesterday
,
and
very
little
will
remain
of
the
theatre
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
I
know
how
_
that
_
would
be
from
the
first
.
<EOS>
It
be
early
for
Bath
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
nobody
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
about
my
uncle
's
usual
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
when
do
you
think
of
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
,
perhaps
,
get
as
far
as
Banbury
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
whose
stable
do
you
use
at
Bath
?
<EOS>
"
be
the
next
question
;
and
while
this
branch
of
the
subject
be
under
discussion
,
Maria
,
who
want
neither
pride
nor
resolution
,
be
prepare
to
encounter
her
share
of
it
with
tolerable
calmness
.
  
<EOS>
to
her
he
soon
turn
,
repeat
much
of
what
he
have
already
say
,
with
only
a
softened
air
and
strong
expression
of
regret
.
<EOS>
but
what
avail
his
expression
or
his
air
?
<EOS>
He
be
go
,
and
,
if
not
voluntarily
go
,
voluntarily
intend
to
stay
away
;
for
,
except
what
may
be
due
to
his
uncle
,
his
engagement
be
all
self
-
impose
.
<EOS>
He
may
talk
of
necessity
,
but
she
know
his
independence
.
<EOS>
the
hand
which
have
so
press
her
to
his
heart
!
<EOS>
the
hand
and
the
heart
be
alike
motionless
and
passive
now
!
<EOS>
Her
spirit
support
her
,
but
the
agony
of
her
mind
be
severe
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
long
to
endure
what
arise
from
listen
to
language
which
his
action
contradict
,
or
to
bury
the
tumult
of
her
feeling
under
the
restraint
of
society
;
for
general
civility
soon
call
his
notice
from
her
,
and
the
farewell
visit
,
as
it
then
become
openly
acknowledge
<EOS>
,
be
a
very
short
one
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
 
<EOS>
he
have
touch
her
hand
for
the
last
time
,
he
have
make
his
parting
bow
,
and
she
may
seek
directly
all
that
solitude
could
do
for
her
.
<EOS>
Henry
Crawford
be
go
,
go
from
the
house
,
and
within
two
hour
afterwards
from
the
parish
;
and
so
end
all
the
hope
his
selfish
vanity
have
raise
in
Maria
and
Julia
Bertram
.
  
<EOS>
Julia
could
rejoice
that
he
be
go
.
<EOS>
His
presence
be
begin
to
be
odious
to
her
;
and
if
Maria
gain
him
not
,
she
be
now
cool
enough
to
dispense
with
any
other
revenge
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
want
exposure
to
be
add
to
desertion
.
<EOS>
Henry
Crawford
go
,
she
could
even
pity
her
sister
.
  
<EOS>
with
a
purer
spirit
do
Fanny
rejoice
in
the
intelligence
.
<EOS>
She
hear
it
at
dinner
,
and
feel
it
a
blessing
.
<EOS>
by
all
the
other
it
be
mention
with
regret
;
and
his
merit
honour
with
due
gradation
of
feel
 
from
the
sincerity
of
Edmund
's
too
partial
regard
,
to
the
unconcern
of
his
mother
speak
entirely
by
rote
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
begin
to
look
about
her
,
and
wonder
that
his
falling
in
love
with
Julia
have
come
to
nothing
;
and
could
almost
fear
that
she
have
be
remis
herself
in
forward
it
;
but
with
so
many
to
care
for
,
how
be
it
possible
for
even
_
<EOS>
her
_
activity
to
keep
pace
with
her
wish
?
  
<EOS>
another
day
or
two
,
and
Mr.
Yates
be
go
likewise
.
<EOS>
in
_
his
_
departure
Sir
Thomas
feel
the
chief
interest
:
want
to
be
alone
with
his
family
,
the
presence
of
a
stranger
superior
to
Mr.
Yates
must
have
be
irksome
;
but
of
him
,
trifling
and
confident
,
idle
and
expensive
,
it
be
every
way
vexatious
.
<EOS>
in
himself
he
be
wearisome
,
but
as
the
friend
of
Tom
and
the
admirer
of
Julia
he
become
offensive
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
have
be
quite
indifferent
to
Mr.
Crawford
's
go
or
stay
:
but
his
good
wish
for
Mr.
Yates
's
have
a
pleasant
journey
,
as
he
walk
with
him
to
the
hall
-
door
,
be
give
with
genuine
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Yates
have
staid
to
see
the
destruction
of
every
theatrical
preparation
at
Mansfield
,
the
removal
of
everything
appertain
to
the
play
:
he
leave
the
house
in
all
the
soberness
of
its
general
character
;
and
Sir
Thomas
hope
,
in
see
him
out
of
it
,
to
be
rid
of
the
bad
object
connect
with
the
scheme
,
and
the
last
that
must
be
inevitably
remind
him
of
its
existence
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
contrive
to
remove
one
article
from
his
sight
that
may
have
distress
him
.
<EOS>
the
curtain
,
over
which
she
have
preside
with
such
talent
and
such
success
,
go
off
with
her
to
her
cottage
,
where
she
happen
to
be
particularly
in
want
of
green
baize
.
    
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
's
return
make
a
strike
change
in
the
way
of
the
family
,
independent
of
Lovers
'
vow
.
<EOS>
under
his
government
,
Mansfield
be
an
altered
place
.
<EOS>
some
member
of
their
society
send
away
,
and
the
spirit
of
many
other
sadden
 
it
be
all
sameness
and
gloom
compare
with
the
past
 
a
sombre
family
party
rarely
enliven
.
<EOS>
there
be
little
intercourse
with
the
Parsonage
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
,
draw
back
from
intimacy
in
general
,
be
particularly
disincline
,
at
this
time
,
for
any
engagement
but
in
one
quarter
.
<EOS>
the
rushworth
be
the
only
addition
to
his
own
domestic
circle
which
he
could
solicit
.
  
<EOS>
Edmund
do
not
wonder
that
such
should
be
his
father
's
feeling
,
nor
could
he
regret
anything
but
the
exclusion
of
the
Grants
.
<EOS>
"
but
they
,
"
he
observe
to
Fanny
,
"
have
a
claim
.
<EOS>
They
seem
to
belong
to
us
;
they
seem
to
be
part
of
ourselves
.
<EOS>
I
could
wish
my
father
be
more
sensible
of
their
very
great
attention
to
my
mother
and
sister
while
he
be
away
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
they
may
feel
themselves
neglect
.
<EOS>
but
the
truth
be
,
that
my
father
hardly
know
them
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
be
here
a
twelvemonth
when
he
leave
England
.
<EOS>
if
he
know
them
better
,
he
would
value
their
society
as
it
deserve
;
for
they
be
in
fact
exactly
the
sort
of
people
he
would
like
.
<EOS>
We
be
sometimes
a
little
in
want
of
animation
among
ourselves
:
my
sister
seem
out
of
spirit
,
and
Tom
be
certainly
not
at
his
ease
.
<EOS>
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Grant
would
enliven
us
,
and
make
our
evening
pass
away
with
more
enjoyment
even
to
my
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
so
?
"
say
Fanny
:
"
in
my
opinion
,
my
uncle
would
not
like
_
any
_
addition
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
value
the
very
quietness
you
speak
of
,
and
that
the
repose
of
his
own
family
circle
be
all
he
want
.
<EOS>
and
it
do
not
appear
to
me
that
we
be
more
serious
than
we
use
to
be
 
<EOS>
I
mean
before
my
uncle
go
abroad
.
<EOS>
as
well
as
I
can
recollect
,
it
be
always
much
the
same
.
<EOS>
there
be
never
much
laughing
in
his
presence
;
or
,
if
there
be
any
difference
,
it
be
not
more
,
I
think
,
than
such
an
absence
have
a
tendency
to
produce
at
first
.
<EOS>
there
must
be
a
sort
of
shyness
;
but
I
can
not
recollect
that
our
evening
formerly
be
ever
merry
,
except
when
my
uncle
be
in
town
.
<EOS>
no
young
people
's
be
,
I
suppose
,
when
those
they
look
up
to
are
at
home

<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
be
right
,
Fanny
,
"
be
his
reply
,
after
a
short
consideration
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
our
evening
be
rather
return
to
what
they
be
,
than
assume
a
new
character
.
<EOS>
the
novelty
be
in
their
be
lively
.
<EOS>
yet
,
how
strong
the
impression
that
only
a
few
week
will
give
!
<EOS>
I
have
be
feel
as
if
we
have
never
live
so
before

<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
be
graver
than
other
people

say
Fanny
.
<EOS>
"
the
evening
do
not
appear
long
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
love
to
hear
my
uncle
talk
of
the
West
Indies
.
<EOS>
I
could
listen
to
him
for
an
hour
together
.
<EOS>
It
entertain
_
me
_
more
than
many
other
thing
have
do
;
but
then
I
be
unlike
other
people
,
I
dare
say
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
you
dare
say
_
that
_
?
"
<EOS>
(
smile
)
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
want
to
be
tell
that
you
be
only
unlike
other
people
in
be
more
wise
and
discreet
?
<EOS>
but
when
do
you
,
or
anybody
,
ever
get
a
compliment
from
me
,
Fanny
?
<EOS>
go
to
my
father
if
you
want
to
be
compliment
.
<EOS>
He
will
satisfy
you
.
<EOS>
ask
your
uncle
what
he
think
,
and
you
will
hear
compliment
enough
:
and
though
they
may
be
chiefly
on
your
person
,
you
must
put
up
with
it
,
and
trust
to
his
seeing
as
much
beauty
of
mind
in
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
such
language
be
so
new
to
Fanny
that
it
quite
embarrass
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
uncle
think
you
very
pretty
,
<EOS>
dear
Fanny
 
<EOS>
and
that
be
the
long
and
the
short
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
anybody
but
myself
would
have
make
something
more
of
it
,
and
anybody
but
you
would
resent
that
you
have
not
be
think
very
pretty
before
;
but
the
truth
be
,
that
your
uncle
never
do
admire
you
till
now
 
<EOS>
and
now
he
do
.
<EOS>
Your
complexion
be
so
improved
!
 
<EOS>
and
you
have
gain
so
much
countenance
!
 
<EOS>
and
your
figure
 
<EOS>
nay
,
Fanny
,
do
not
turn
away
about
it
 
<EOS>
it
be
but
an
uncle
.
<EOS>
if
you
can
not
bear
an
uncle
's
admiration
,
what
be
to
become
of
you
?
<EOS>
You
must
really
begin
to
harden
yourself
to
the
idea
of
be
worth
look
at
.
<EOS>
You
must
try
not
to
mind
grow
up
into
a
pretty
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
do
not
talk
so
,
do
not
talk
so

"
cry
Fanny
,
distress
by
more
feeling
than
he
be
aware
of
;
but
see
that
she
be
distressed
,
he
have
do
with
the
subject
,
and
only
add
more
seriously
    
"
Your
uncle
be
dispose
to
be
pleased
with
you
in
every
respect
;
and
I
only
wish
you
would
talk
to
him
more

<EOS>
You
be
one
of
those
who
be
too
silent
in
the
evening
circle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
talk
to
him
more
than
I
use
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
do
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
hear
me
ask
him
about
the
slave
-
trade
last
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
 
and
be
in
hope
the
question
would
be
follow
up
by
other
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
please
your
uncle
to
be
inquire
of
farther
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
long
to
do
it
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
such
a
dead
silence
!
<EOS>
and
while
my
cousin
be
sit
by
without
speak
a
word
,
or
seem
at
all
interest
in
the
subject
,
I
do
not
like
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
appear
as
if
I
want
to
set
myself
off
at
their
expense
,
by
shew
a
curiosity
and
pleasure
in
his
information
which
he
must
wish
his
own
daughter
to
feel
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Miss
Crawford
be
very
right
in
what
she
say
of
you
the
other
day
:
that
you
seem
almost
as
fearful
of
notice
and
praise
as
other
woman
be
of
neglect
.
<EOS>
We
be
talk
of
you
at
the
Parsonage
,
and
those
be
her
word
.
<EOS>
She
have
great
discernment
.
<EOS>
I
know
nobody
who
distinguish
character
better
.
<EOS>
for
so
young
a
woman
it
be
remarkable
!
<EOS>
She
certainly
understand
_
you
_
better
than
you
be
understand
by
the
great
part
of
those
who
have
know
you
so
long
;
and
with
regard
to
some
other
,
I
can
perceive
,
from
occasional
lively
hint
,
the
unguarded
expression
of
the
moment
,
that
she
could
define
_
many
_
as
accurately
,
do
not
delicacy
forbid
it
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
she
think
of
my
father
!
<EOS>
She
must
admire
him
as
a
fine
-
looking
man
,
with
most
gentlemanlike
,
dignified
,
consistent
manner
;
but
perhaps
,
have
see
him
so
seldom
,
his
reserve
may
be
a
little
repulsive
.
<EOS>
Could
they
be
much
together
<EOS>
,
I
feel
sure
of
their
like
each
other
.
<EOS>
He
would
enjoy
her
liveliness
and
she
have
talent
to
value
his
power
.
<EOS>
I
wish
they
meet
more
frequently
!
<EOS>
I
hope
she
do
not
suppose
there
be
any
dislike
on
his
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
must
know
herself
too
secure
of
the
regard
of
all
the
rest
of
you
,
"
say
Fanny
,
with
half
a
sigh
,
"
to
have
any
such
apprehension
.
<EOS>
and
Sir
Thomas
's
wishing
just
at
first
to
be
only
with
his
family
,
be
so
very
natural
,
that
she
can
argue
nothing
from
that
.
<EOS>
after
a
little
while
,
I
dare
say
,
we
shall
be
meet
again
in
the
same
sort
of
way
,
allow
for
the
difference
of
the
time
of
year
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
the
first
October
that
she
have
pass
in
the
country
since
her
infancy
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
call
Tunbridge
or
Cheltenham
the
country
;
and
November
be
a
still
more
serious
month
,
and
I
can
see
that
Mrs.
Grant
be
very
anxious
for
her
not
find
Mansfield
dull
as
winter
come
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
could
have
say
a
great
deal
,
but
it
be
safe
to
say
nothing
,
and
leave
untouched
all
Miss
Crawford
's
resource
 
her
accomplishment
,
her
spirit
,
her
importance
,
her
friend
,
lest
it
should
betray
her
into
any
observation
seemingly
unhandsome
.
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
's
kind
opinion
of
herself
deserve
at
least
a
grateful
forbearance
,
and
she
begin
to
talk
of
something
else
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
-
morrow
,
I
think
,
my
uncle
dine
at
Sotherton
,
and
you
and
Mr.
Bertram
too
.
<EOS>
We
shall
be
quite
a
small
party
at
home
.
<EOS>
I
hope
my
uncle
may
continue
to
like
Mr.
Rushworth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
impossible
,
Fanny
.
<EOS>
He
must
like
him
less
after
to
-
morrow
's
visit
,
for
we
shall
be
five
hour
in
his
company
.
<EOS>
I
should
dread
the
stupidity
of
the
day
,
if
there
be
not
a
much
great
evil
to
follow
 
the
impression
it
must
leave
on
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
much
longer
deceive
himself
.
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
for
them
all
,
and
would
give
something
that
Rushworth
and
Maria
have
never
meet
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
this
quarter
,
indeed
,
disappointment
be
impend
over
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
not
all
his
good
-
will
for
Mr.
Rushworth
,
not
all
Mr.
Rushworth
's
deference
for
him
,
could
prevent
him
from
soon
discern
some
part
of
the
truth
 
that
Mr.
Rushworth
be
an
inferior
young
man
,
as
ignorant
in
business
as
in
book
,
with
opinion
in
general
unfixed
,
and
without
seem
much
aware
of
it
himself
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
expect
a
very
different
son
-
in
-
law
;
and
begin
to
feel
grave
on
Maria
's
account
,
try
to
understand
_
her
_
feeling
.
<EOS>
little
observation
there
be
necessary
to
tell
him
that
indifference
be
the
most
favourable
state
they
could
be
in
.
<EOS>
Her
behaviour
to
Mr.
Rushworth
be
careless
and
cold
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
,
do
not
like
him
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
resolve
to
speak
seriously
to
her
.
<EOS>
advantageous
as
would
be
the
alliance
,
and
long
standing
and
public
as
be
the
engagement
,
her
happiness
must
not
be
sacrifice
to
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rushworth
have
,
perhaps
,
be
accept
on
too
short
an
acquaintance
,
and
,
on
know
him
better
,
she
be
repent
.
  
<EOS>
with
solemn
kindness
Sir
Thomas
address
her
:
tell
her
his
fear
,
inquire
into
her
wish
,
entreat
her
to
be
open
and
sincere
,
and
assure
her
that
every
inconvenience
should
be
brave
,
and
<EOS>
the
connexion
entirely
give
up
,
if
she
feel
herself
unhappy
in
the
prospect
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
would
act
for
her
and
release
her
.
<EOS>
Maria
have
a
moment
's
struggle
as
she
listen
,
and
only
a
moment
's
:
when
her
father
cease
,
she
be
able
to
give
her
answer
immediately
,
decidedly
,
and
with
no
apparent
agitation
.
<EOS>
She
thank
him
for
his
great
attention
,
his
paternal
kindness
,
but
he
be
quite
mistaken
in
supposing
<EOS>
she
have
the
small
desire
of
break
through
her
engagement
,
or
be
sensible
of
any
change
of
opinion
or
inclination
since
her
form
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
the
high
esteem
for
Mr.
Rushworth
's
character
and
disposition
,
and
could
not
have
a
doubt
of
her
happiness
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
be
satisfy
;
too
glad
to
be
satisfied
,
perhaps
,
to
urge
the
matter
quite
so
far
as
his
judgment
may
have
dictate
to
other
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
alliance
which
he
could
not
have
relinquish
without
pain
;
and
thus
he
reason
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rushworth
be
young
enough
to
improve
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rushworth
must
and
would
improve
in
good
society
;
and
if
Maria
could
now
speak
so
securely
of
her
happiness
with
him
,
speak
certainly
without
the
prejudice
,
the
blindness
of
love
,
she
ought
to
be
believe
.
<EOS>
Her
feeling
,
probably
,
be
not
acute
;
he
have
never
suppose
them
to
be
so
;
but
her
comfort
may
not
be
less
on
that
account
;
and
if
she
could
dispense
with
see
her
husband
a
lead
,
shine
character
,
there
would
certainly
be
everything
else
in
her
favour
.
<EOS>
a
well
-
dispose
young
woman
,
who
do
not
marry
for
love
,
be
in
general
but
the
more
attached
to
her
own
family
;
and
the
nearness
of
Sotherton
to
Mansfield
must
naturally
hold
out
the
great
temptation
,
and
would
,
in
all
probability
,
be
a
continual
supply
of
the
most
amiable
and
innocent
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
such
and
such
-
like
be
the
reasoning
of
Sir
Thomas
,
happy
to
escape
the
embarrassing
evil
of
a
rupture
,
the
wonder
,
the
reflection
,
the
reproach
that
must
attend
it
;
happy
to
secure
a
marriage
which
would
bring
him
such
an
addition
of
respectability
and
influence
,
and
very
happy
to
think
anything
of
his
daughter
's
disposition
that
be
most
favourable
for
the
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
to
her
the
conference
close
as
satisfactorily
as
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
a
state
of
mind
to
be
glad
that
she
have
secure
her
fate
beyond
recall
:
that
she
have
pledge
herself
anew
to
Sotherton
;
that
she
be
safe
from
the
possibility
of
give
Crawford
the
triumph
of
govern
her
action
,
and
destroy
her
prospect
;
and
retire
in
proud
resolve
,
determine
only
to
behave
more
cautiously
to
Mr.
Rushworth
in
future
,
that
her
father
may
not
be
again
suspect
her
.
  
<EOS>
have
Sir
Thomas
apply
to
his
daughter
within
the
first
three
or
four
day
after
Henry
Crawford
's
leave
Mansfield
,
before
her
feeling
be
at
all
tranquillise
,
before
she
have
give
up
every
hope
of
him
,
or
absolutely
resolve
on
endure
his
rival
,
her
answer
may
have
be
different
;
but
after
another
three
or
four
day
,
when
there
be
no
return
,
no
letter
,
no
message
,
no
symptom
of
a
softened
heart
,
no
hope
of
advantage
from
separation
,
her
mind
become
cool
enough
to
seek
all
the
comfort
that
pride
and
self
revenge
could
give
.
  
<EOS>
Henry
Crawford
have
destroy
her
happiness
,
but
he
should
not
know
that
he
have
do
it
;
he
should
not
destroy
her
credit
,
her
appearance
,
her
prosperity
,
too
.
<EOS>
He
should
not
have
to
think
of
her
as
pining
in
the
retirement
of
Mansfield
for
_
him
_
,
reject
Sotherton
and
London
,
independence
and
splendour
,
for
_
his
_
sake
.
<EOS>
independence
be
more
needful
than
ever
;
the
want
of
it
at
Mansfield
more
sensibly
feel
.
<EOS>
She
be
less
and
less
able
to
endure
the
restraint
which
her
father
impose
.
<EOS>
the
liberty
which
his
absence
have
give
be
now
become
absolutely
necessary
.
<EOS>
She
must
escape
from
him
and
Mansfield
as
soon
as
possible
,
and
find
consolation
in
fortune
and
consequence
,
bustle
and
the
world
,
for
a
wounded
spirit
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
be
quite
determined
,
and
varied
not
.
  
<EOS>
to
such
feeling
delay
,
even
the
delay
of
much
preparation
,
would
have
be
an
evil
,
and
Mr.
Rushworth
could
hardly
be
more
impatient
for
the
marriage
than
herself
.
<EOS>
in
all
the
important
preparation
of
the
mind
she
be
complete
:
be
prepare
for
matrimony
by
an
hatred
of
home
,
restraint
,
and
tranquillity
;
by
the
misery
of
disappointed
affection
,
and
contempt
of
the
man
she
be
to
marry
.
<EOS>
the
rest
may
wait
.
<EOS>
the
preparation
of
new
carriage
and
furniture
may
wait
for
London
and
spring
,

her
own
taste
could
have
fair
play
.
  
<EOS>
the
principal
be
all
agree
in
this
respect
,
it
soon
appear
that
a
very
few
week
would
be
sufficient
for
such
arrangement
as
must
precede
the
wedding
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Rushworth
be
quite
ready
to
retire
,
and
make
way
for
the
fortunate
young
woman
whom
her
dear
son
have
select
;
and
very
early
in
November
remove
herself
,
her
maid
,
her
footman
,
and
her
chariot
,
with
true
dowager
propriety
,
to
Bath
,
there
to
parade
over
the
wonder
of
Sotherton
in
her
evening
party
;
enjoy
them
as
thoroughly
,
perhaps
,
in
the
animation
of
a
card
-
table
,
as
she
have
ever
do
on
the
spot
;
and
before
the
middle
of
the
same
month
the
ceremony
have
take
place
which
give
Sotherton
another
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
proper
wedding
.
<EOS>
the
bride
be
elegantly
dress
;
the
two
bridesmaid
be
duly
inferior
;
her
father
give
her
away
;
her
mother
stand
with
salt
in
her
hand
,
expect
to
be
agitate
;
her
aunt
try
to
cry
;
and
the
service
be
impressively
read
by
Dr.
Grant
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
object
to
when
it
come
under
the
discussion
of
the
neighbourhood
,
except
that
the
carriage
which
convey
the
bride
and
bridegroom
and
Julia
from
the
church
-
door
to
Sotherton
be
the
same
chaise
which
Mr.
Rushworth
have
use
for
a
twelvemonth
before
.
<EOS>
in
everything
else
the
etiquette
of
the
day
may
stand
the
strict
investigation
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
do
,
and
they
be
go
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
feel
as
an
anxious
father
must
feel
,
and
be
indeed
experience
much
of
the
agitation
which
his
wife
have
be
apprehensive
of
for
herself
,
but
have
fortunately
escape
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
,
most
happy
to
assist
in
the
duty
of
the
day
,
by
spend
it
at
the
Park
to
support
her
sister
's
spirit
,
and
drink
the
health
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Rushworth
in
a
supernumerary
glass
or
two
,
be
all
joyous
delight
;
for
she
have
make
the
match
;
she
have
do
everything
;
and
no
one
would
have
suppose
,
from
her
confident
triumph
,
that
she
have
ever
hear
of
conjugal
infelicity
in
her
life
,
or
could
have
the
small
insight
into
the
disposition
of
the
niece
who
have
be
bring
up
under
her
eye
.
  
<EOS>
the
plan
of
the
young
couple
be
to
proceed
,
after
a
few
day
,
to
Brighton
,
and
take
a
house
there
for
some
week
.
<EOS>
every
public
place
be
new
to
Maria
,
and
Brighton
be
almost
as
gay
in
winter
as
in
summer
.
<EOS>
when
the
novelty
of
amusement
there
be
over
,
it
would
be
time
for
the
wide
range
of
London
.
  
<EOS>
Julia
be
to
go
with
them
to
Brighton
.
<EOS>
since
rivalry
between
the
sister
have
cease
,
they
have
be
gradually
recover
much
of
their
former
good
understanding
;
and
be
at
least
sufficiently
friend
to
make
each
of
them
exceedingly
glad
to
be
with
the
other
at
such
a
time
.
<EOS>
some
other
companion
than
Mr.
Rushworth
be
of
the
first
consequence
to
his
lady
;
and
Julia
be
quite
as
eager
for
novelty
and
pleasure
as
Maria
,
though
she
may
not
have
struggle
through
so
much
to
obtain
them
,
and
could
better
bear
a
subordinate
situation
.
  
<EOS>
Their
departure
make
another
material
change
at
Mansfield
,
a
chasm
which
require
some
time
to
fill
up
.
<EOS>
the
family
circle
become
greatly
contract
;
and
though
the
Miss
Bertrams
have
latterly
add
little
to
its
gaiety
,
they
could
not
but
be
miss
.
<EOS>
even
their
mother
miss
them
;
and
how
much
more
their
tenderhearted
cousin
,
who
wander
about
the
house
,
and
thought
of
them
,
and
feel
for
them
,
with
a
degree
of
affectionate
regret
which
they
have
never
do
much
to
deserve
!
    
<EOS>
Fanny
's
consequence
increase
on
the
departure
of
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
become
,
as
she
then
do
,
the
only
young
woman
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
the
only
occupier
of
that
interesting
division
of
a
family
in
which
she
have
hitherto
hold
<EOS>
so
humble
a
third
,
it
be
impossible
for
her
not
to
be
more
look
at
,
more

attend
to
,
than
she
have
ever
be

become
no

<EOS>
not
only
at
home
do
her
value
increase
,
but
at
the
Parsonage
too
.
<EOS>
in
that
house
,
which
she
have
hardly
enter
twice
a
year
since
Mr.
Norris
's
death
,
she
become
a
welcome
,
an
invite
guest
,
and
in
the
gloom
and
dirt
of
a
November
day
,
most
acceptable
to
Mary
Crawford
.
<EOS>
Her
visit
there
,
begin
by
chance
,
be
continue
by
solicitation
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grant
,
really
eager
to
get
any
change
for
her
sister
,
could
,
by
the
easy
self
-
deceit
,
persuade
herself
that
she
be
do
the
kind
thing
by
Fanny
,
and
give
her
the
most
important
opportunity
of
improvement
in
press
her
frequent
call

<EOS>
Fanny

have
be
send
into
the
village
on
some
errand
by
her
aunt
Norris
,
be
overtake
by
a
heavy
shower
close
to
the
parsonage
;
and
be

from
one
of
the
window
endeavour
to
find
shelter
under
the
branch
and
linger
leave
of
an
oak
just
beyond
their
premise
,
be
force
,
though
not
without
some
modest
reluctance
on
her
part
,
to
come
in
.
<EOS>
a
civil
servant
she
have
withstand
;
but
when
Dr.
Grant
himself
go
out
with
an
umbrella
,
there
be
nothing
to
be
do
but
to
be
very
much
ashamed
,
and
to
get
into
the
house
as
fast
as
possible
;
and
to
poor
Miss
Crawford
,
who
have
just
be
contemplate
the
dismal
rain
in
a
very
desponding
state
of
mind
,
sigh
over
the
ruin
of
all
her
plan
of
exercise
for
that
morning
,
and
of
every
chance
of
see
a
single
creature
beyond
themselves
for
the
next
twenty
-
four
hour
,
the
sound
of
a
little
bustle
at
the
front
door
,
and
the
sight
of
Miss
Price
drip
with
wet
in
the
vestibule
,
be
delightful
.
<EOS>
the
value
of
an
event
on
a
wet
day
in
the
country
be
most
forcibly
bring
before
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
all
alive
again
directly
,
and
among
the
most
active
in
be
useful
to
Fanny
,
in
detect
her
to
be
wet
than
she
would
at
first
allow
,
and
provide
her
with
dry
clothe
;
and
Fanny
,
after
be
oblige
to
submit
to
all
this
attention
,
and
to
be
assist
and
wait
on
by
mistress
and
maid
,
be
also
oblige
,
on
return
downstairs
,
to
be
fix
in
their
drawing
-
room
for
an
hour
while
the
rain
continue
,
the
blessing
of
something
fresh
to
see
and
think
of
be
thus
extend
to
Miss
Crawford
,
and
may
carry
on
her
spirit
to
the
period
of
dressing
and
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
sister
be
so
kind
to
her
,
and
so
pleasant
,
that
Fanny
may
have
enjoy
her
visit
could
she
have
believe
herself
not
in
the
way
,
and
could
she
have
foresee
that
the
weather
would
certainly
clear
at
the
end
of
the
hour
,
and
save
her
from
the
shame
of
have
Dr.
Grant
's
carriage
and
horse
out
to
take
her
home
,
with
which
she
be
threaten
.
<EOS>
as
to
anxiety
for
any
alarm
that
her
absence
in
such
weather
may
occasion
at
home
,
she
have
nothing
to
suffer
on
that
score
;
for
as
her
be
out
be
know
only
to
her
two
aunt
,
she
be
perfectly
aware
that
none
would
be
feel
,
and
that
in
whatever
cottage
aunt
Norris
may
chuse
to
establish
her
during
the
rain
,
her
be
in
such
cottage
would
be
indubitable
to
aunt
Bertram
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
begin
to
look
bright
,
when
Fanny
,
observe
a
harp
in
the
room
,
ask
some
question
about
it
,
which
soon
lead
to
an
acknowledgment
of
her
wish
very
much
to
hear
it
,
and
a
confession
,
which
could
hardly
be
believe
,
of
her
have
never
yet
hear
it
since
its
being
in
Mansfield
.
<EOS>
to
Fanny
herself
it
appear
a
very
simple
and
natural
circumstance
.
<EOS>
She
have
scarcely
ever
be
at
the
Parsonage
since
the
instrument
's
arrival
,
there
have
be
no
reason
that
she
should
;
but
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
,
call
to
mind
an
early
express
wish
on
the
subject
,
be
concern
at
her
own
neglect
;
and
"
Shall
I
play
to
you
now
?
"
<EOS>
and
"
what
will
you
have
?
<EOS>
"
be
question
immediately
follow
with
the
readiest
good
-
humour
.
  
<EOS>
She
play
accordingly
;
happy
to
have
a
new
listener
,
and
a
listener
who
seem
so
much
oblige
,
so
full
of
wonder
at
the
performance
,
and
who
shew
herself
not
want
in
taste
.
<EOS>
She
play
till
Fanny
's
eye
,
stray
to
the
window
on
the
weather
's
be
evidently
fair
,
speak
what
she
feel
must
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
another
quarter
of
an
hour
,
"
say
Miss
Crawford
,
"
and
we
shall
see
how
it
will
be
.
<EOS>
do
not
run
away
the
first
moment
of
its
holding
up
.
<EOS>
those
cloud
look
alarming
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
they
be
pass
over
,
"
say
Fanny
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
watch
them
.
<EOS>
this
weather
be
all
from
the
south
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
south
or
north
,
I
know
a
black
cloud
when
I
see
it
;
and
you
must
not
set
forward
while
it
be
so
threatening
.
<EOS>
and
besides
,
I
want
to
play
something
more
to
you
 
a
very
pretty
piece
 
and
your
cousin
Edmund
's
prime
favourite
.
<EOS>
You
must
stay
and
hear
your
cousin
's
favourite
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
feel
that
she
must
;
and
though
she
have
not
wait
for
that
sentence
to
be
think
of
Edmund
,
such
a
memento
make
her
particularly
awake
to
his
idea
,
and
she
fancy
him
sit
in
that
room
again
and
again
,
perhaps
in
the
very
spot
where
she
sit
now
,
listen
with
constant
delight
to
the
favourite
air
,
play
,
as
it
appear
to
her
,
with
superior
tone
and
expression
;
and
though
pleased
with
it
herself
,
and
glad
to
like
whatever
be
like
by
him
,
she
be
more
sincerely
impatient
to
go
away
at
the
conclusion
of
it
than
she
have
be
before
;
and
on
this
be
evident
,
she
be
so
kindly
ask
to
call
again
,
to
take
them
in
her
walk
whenever
she
could
,
to
come
and
hear
more
of
the
harp
,
that
she
feel
it
necessary
to
be
do
,
if
no
objection
arise
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
origin
of
the
sort
of
intimacy
which
take
place
between
them
within
the
first
fortnight
after
the
Miss
Bertrams
'
go
away
 
an
intimacy
result
principally
from
Miss
Crawford
's
desire
of
something
new
,
and
which
have
little
reality
in
Fanny
's
feeling
.
<EOS>
Fanny
go
to
her
every
two
or
three
day
:
<EOS>
it
seem
a
kind
of
fascination
:
she
could
not
be
easy
without
go
,
and
yet
it
be
without
love
her
,
without
ever
think
like
her
,
without
any
sense
of
obligation
for
be
seek
after
now
when
nobody
else
be
to
be
have
;
and
derive
no
high
pleasure
from
her
conversation
than
occasional
amusement
,
and
_
that
_
often
at
the
expense
of
her
judgment
,
when
it
be
raise
by
pleasantry
on
people
or
subject
which
she
wish
to
be
respect
.
<EOS>
She
go
,
however
,
and
they
saunter
about
together
many
an
half
-
hour
in
Mrs.
Grant
's
shrubbery
,
the
weather
be
unusually
mild
for
the
time
of
year
,
and
venture
sometimes
even
to
sit
down
on
one
of
the
bench
now
comparatively
unsheltered
,
remain
there
perhaps
till
,
in
the
midst
of
some
tender
ejaculation
of
Fanny
's
on
the
sweet
of
so
protract
an
autumn
<EOS>
,
they
be
force
,
by
the
sudden
swell
of
a
cold
gust
shake
down
the
last
few
yellow
leave
about
them
,
to
jump
up
and
walk
for
warmth
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
pretty
,
very
pretty
,
"
say
Fanny
,
look
around
her
as
they
be
thus
sit
together
one
day
;
"
every
time
I
come
into
this
shrubbery
<EOS>
I
be
more
strike
with
its
growth
and
beauty
.
<EOS>
three
year
ago
,
this
be
nothing
but
a
rough
hedgerow
along
the
upper
side
of
the
field
,
never
think
of
as
anything
,
or
capable
of
become
anything
;
and
now
it
be
convert
into
a
walk
,
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
whether
most
valuable
as
a
convenience
or
an
ornament
;
and
perhaps
,
in
another
three
year
,
we
may
be
forget
 
<EOS>
almost
forget
what
it
be
before
.
<EOS>
how
wonderful
,
how
very
wonderful
the
operation
of
time
,
and
the
change
of
the
human
mind
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
follow
the
latter
train
of
thought
,
she
soon
afterwards
add
:
"
if
any
one
faculty
of
our
nature
may
be
call
_
more
_
wonderful
than
the
rest
,
I
do
think
it
be
memory
.
<EOS>
there
seem
something
more
speakingly
incomprehensible
in
the
power
,
the
failure
,
the
inequality
of
memory
,
than
in
any
other
of
our
intelligence
.
<EOS>
the
memory
be
sometimes
so
retentive
,
so
serviceable
,
so
obedient
;
at
other
,
so
bewilder
and
so
weak
;
and
at
other
again
,
so
tyrannic
,
so
beyond
control
!
<EOS>
We
be
,
to
be
sure
,
a
miracle
every
way
;
but
our
power
of
recollecting
and
of
forgetting
do
seem
peculiarly
past
find
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
,
untouched
and
inattentive
,
have
nothing
to
say
;
and
Fanny
,
perceive
it
,
bring
back
her
own
mind
to
what
she
think
must
interest
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
seem
impertinent
in
_
me
_
to
praise
,
but
I
must
admire
the
taste
Mrs.
Grant
have
shew
in
all
this
.
<EOS>
there
be
such
a
quiet
simplicity
in
the
plan
of
the
walk
!
<EOS>
not
too
much
attempt
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
reply
Miss
Crawford
carelessly
,
"
it
do
very
well
for
a
place
of
this
sort

<EOS>
one
do
not

of
extent

between

's
gardener
always
say
the
soil
here
be
well
than
his
own
,
and
so
it
appear
from
the
growth
of
the
laurel
and
evergreen
in
general
.
<EOS>
the
evergreen
!
<EOS>
how
beautiful
,
how
welcome
,
how
wonderful
the
evergreen
!
<EOS>
when
one
think
of
it
,
how
astonish
a
variety
of
nature
!
<EOS>
in
some
country
we
know
the
tree
that
shed
its
leaf
be
the
variety
,
but
that
do
not
make
it
less
amazing
that
the
same
soil
and
the
same
sun
should
nurture
plant
differ
in
the
first
rule
and
law
of
their
existence
.
<EOS>
You
will
think
me
rhapsodise
;
but
when
I
be
out
of
door
,
especially
when
I
be
sit
out
of
door
,
I
be
very
apt
to
get
into
this
sort
of
wonder
strain
.
<EOS>
one
can
not
fix
one
's
eye
on
the
common
natural
production
without
find
food
for
a
rambling
fancy
.
<EOS>

<EOS>

the
truth

"
reply
Miss
Crawford
,
"
I
be
something
like
the
famous
Doge
at
the
court
of
Lewis
XIV

;
and
may
declare
that
I
see
no
wonder
in
this
shrubbery
equal
to
see
myself
in
it

<EOS>
if
anybody

I

I
can
even
suppose
it
pleasant

the

very
pleasant

there

about

I

"
cry
Miss

"
you
be
two
of
the

I

I

Mr.

of

you

<EOS>
I
have
my
alarm
,
but
they
be
quite
in
a
different
quarter
;
and
if
I
could
have
alter
the
weather
,
you
would
have
have
a
good
sharp
east
wind
blow
on
you
the
whole

be
some
of
my
plant
which
Robert
_
will
_
leave
out
because
the
night
be
so
mild
,
and
I
know
the
end
of
it
will
be
,
that
we
shall
have
a
sudden
change
of
weather
,
a
hard
frost
set
in
all
at
once
,
take
everybody
(
at
least
Robert
)
by
surprise
,
and
I
shall
lose
every
one
;

what
be
bad

cook
have
just
be
tell
me
that
the
turkey
,
which
I
particularly
wish
not
to

I
know
how
much
more
Dr.

would
enjoy
it
on
Sunday
after
the
fatigue

will
not

these

unseasonably
close

bitter

Fanny

barely
time
for
an
unpleasant
feeling

when
Mrs.

,
with
sudden
recollection

turn
to

ask
for

ascertain
with
half
a
look

half
a
sentence

that
she
have
no
objection

on
her
aunt

account
,
could
not
imagine
that
his

would
make
any
difficulty

her
,

therefore
give
his

open
advice

Fanny

not
venture

even
on

such

independence

it

always

come
back

Her
story
begin
;

Fanny
immediately
slip
out
of

room
;
for
to
hear
herself
the
subject

any
discussion
with
her

be
more
than
her
nerve
could
bear

She
be
anxious

she
know
 
more
anxious
perhaps
than
she
ought
to
be
 
for
what
be
it
after
all
whether
she
go

staid
?

if
her
uncle
be
to
be
a
great
while
consider

decide
,

with
very
grave

those
grave
look
direct

at

she

indifferent

cause

go

begin
,
on

<EOS>
Edmund
find
himself
oblige
to
speak

up
the
blank
in

story

He
tell
the
whole
;

she
have
only
to
add
,
"
so
strange
!
<EOS>
for
Mrs.

never
use
to
ask
her
.

be
it
not
very
natural

observe
Edmund
,

that
Mrs.

should
wish
to
procure
so
agreeable
a
visitor

<EOS>

nothing
can
be

natural

Sir

deliberation

be
there
no
sister

could
anything

be
more
natural

<EOS>
Mrs.
Grant
's
shew
civility
to
Miss
Price
,
to
Lady
Bertram
's
niece

could
never
want
explanation

the
only
surprise
I
can
feel
be
,
that
this
should
be
the

time
of
its
be
pay

<EOS>
Fanny
be
perfectly
right
in
give
only
a
conditional
answer
.
<EOS>
She
appear
to
feel
as
she
ought
.
<EOS>
but
as
I
conclude
that
she
must
wish
to
go
,
since
all
young
people
like
to
be
together
,
I
can
see
no
reason
why
she
should
be
deny
the
indulgence

can
I
do
without

indeed
I

She
always
make
tea

you
know

when

<EOS>
"
Your
sister

perhaps
,
may
be

on

the
day
with
us

I
shall
certainly
be
at
home

very
well

then

go

good
news

at

one

You

Fanny

instinctive
reply

when
she
have
turn
from
him
and
shut
the
door
,
she
could
not
help
feel
,
"
<EOS>
and
yet
why
should
I
be
glad
?
<EOS>
for
be
I
not
certain
of
see

hear
something
there
to
pain
me
?

<EOS>
in
spite
of
this
conviction
,
however
,
she
be
glad
.
<EOS>
simple
as
such
an
engagement
may
appear
in
other
eye
,
it
have
novelty
and
importance
in
her
,
for
except
the
day
at
Sotherton
,
she
have
scarcely
ever
dine
out
before
;
and
though
now
go
only
half
a
mile
,
and
only
to
three
people
,
still
it
be
dine
out
,
and
all
the
little
interest
of
preparation
be
enjoyment
in
themselves
.
<EOS>
She
have
neither
sympathy
nor
assistance
from
those
who
ought
to
have
enter
into
her
feeling
and
direct
her
taste
;
for
Lady
Bertram
never
think
of
be
useful
to
anybody
,
and
Mrs.
Norris
,
when
she
come
on
the
morrow
,
in
consequence
of
an
early
call
and
invitation
from
Sir
Thomas
,
be
in
a
very
ill
humour
,
and
seem
intent
only
on
lessen
her
niece
's
pleasure
,
both
present
and
future
,
as
much
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
Fanny
,
you
be
in
high
luck
to
meet
with
such
attention
and
indulgence
!
<EOS>
You
ought
to
be
very
much
oblige
to
Mrs.
Grant
for
think
of
you
,
and
to
your
aunt
for
let
you
go
,
and
you
ought
to
look
upon
it
as
something
extraordinary
;
for
I
hope
you
be
aware
that
there
be
no
real
occasion
for
your
go
into
company
in
this
sort
of
way
,
or
ever
dine
out
at
all
;
and
it
be
what
you
must
not
depend
upon
ever
be
repeat
.
<EOS>
nor
must
you
be
fancy
that
the
invitation
be
mean
as
any
particular
compliment
to
_
you
_
;
the
compliment
be
intend
to
your
uncle

aunt

me

<EOS>
Mrs.
Grant
think
it
a
civility
due
to
<EOS>
_
us
_
<EOS>
to
take
a
little
notice
of
you
,
or
else
it
would
never
have
come
into
her
head
,
and
you
may
be
very
certain
that
,
if
your
cousin
Julia
have
be
at
home
,
you
would
not
have
be
ask
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
have
now
so
ingeniously
do
away
all
Mrs.
Grant
's
part
of
the
favour
,
that
Fanny
,
who
find
herself
expect
to
speak
,
could
only
say
that
she
be
very
much
oblige
to
her
aunt
Bertram
for
spare
her
,
and
that
she
be
endeavour
to
put
her
aunt
's
evening
work
in
such
a
state
as
to
prevent
her
be
miss
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
depend
upon
it

your

can
do
very
well
without
you

you
would
not

to
go

_
I
_
shall
be
here

you

quite
easy

you
will
have
a
very
_
agreeable
_
day

find
it
all
mighty

delightful

<EOS>
but
I
must
observe
that
five
be
the
very
awkwardest
of
all
possible
number
to
sit
down
to
table
;
and
I
can
not
but
be
surprised
that
such
an
_
elegant
_
lady
as
Mrs.

should
not
contrive
better
!

round
their
enormous
great
wide
table

too

which
fill
up
the
room
so
dreadfully
!

have
the
doctor
be
content
to
take
my
dining
-
table
when
I
come
away
,
as
anybody
in
their
sense
would
have
do
,
instead
of
have
that
absurd
new
one
of
his
own
,
which
be
wide
,
literally
wide
than
the
dinner
-
table
here
,
how
infinitely
better
it
would
have
be
!
<EOS>
and
how
much
more
he
would
have
be
respect
!
<EOS>
for
people
be
never
respect
when
they
step
out
of
their
proper
sphere

<EOS>
remember
that

Fanny

<EOS>
five
 
only
five

be
sit
round
that
table

you
will
have
dinner
enough
on
it
for
ten

I
dare
say

<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
fetch
breath
,

go
on
again

<EOS>
"
the
nonsense
and
folly
of
people
's
step
out
of
their
rank
and
try
to
appear
above
themselves

make
me
think
it
right
to
give
_
you
_
<EOS>
a
hint
,
Fanny
,
now
that
you
be
go
into
company
without
any

I
do

entreat
you
not

put
yourself
forward

give
your

in
a
manner

you
be
not

you

<EOS>

yes

go
home
to

night

,
therefore
,
the
carriage
will
not
be
out
on

so
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
what
may

take
your
thing
accordingly

<EOS>
Her
niece
think
it
perfectly
reasonable

She
rate
her
own
claim
to
comfort
as
low
even
as
Mrs.
Norris
could
;
and
when
Sir
Thomas
soon
afterwards
,
just
open
the
door
,
say
,
"
Fanny
,
at
what
time
would
you
have
the
carriage
come
round
?

<EOS>
she
feel
a
degree
of
astonishment
which
make
it
impossible
for
her
to
speak

"
My

Mrs.

repeat
Sir
Thomas
,
in
a
tone

unanswerable
dignity

farther
into
the
room

"
My
niece

to

dinner
engagement

Will
twenty
minute

you

"
yes

sir

Fanny
's
humble
answer

give
with
the
feeling
almost
of
a
criminal
towards
Mrs.
Norris
;
and
not
bear
to
remain
with
her
in
what
may
seem
a
state
of
triumph

she
follow
her
uncle
out
of
the
room

staid
behind
him
only
long
enough
to
hear
these
word
speak

angry
agitation

quite
unnecessary

a
great
deal

kind

upon
Edmund

account

I
observe
he
be
hoarse
on
Thursday
night

<EOS>

this
could
not
impose
on
Fanny

<EOS>
She
feel
that
the
carriage
be
for
herself
,

herself
alone
:
and
her
uncle
's
consideration
of
her
,
come
immediately
after
such
representation
from
her
aunt
,
cost
her
some
tear
of
gratitude
when
she
be
alone

drive
round
to
a
minute

another
minute

down
the

scrupulous
fear
of

late

them
off

punctual

now
I
must
look
at
you

say
Edmund
,
with
the
kind
smile
of
an
affectionate
brother
,
"
and
tell
you
how
I
like
you

as
well
as
I
can
judge
by

very
nicely

the

good

give
me
on
my
cousin

marriage

I
hope
it
be
not

fine
;
but
I
think
I
ought
to
wear
it
as
soon
as
I
could
,
and
that
I
may
not
have
such
another
opportunity
all
the
winter

I

you
do

me
too
fine

a
woman
can
never
be
too
fine

she
be
all
in
white

<EOS>
no

I
see
no
finery
about
you

nothing

what
be
perfectly
proper

<EOS>
Your
gown
seem
very
pretty

<EOS>
I
like
these
glossy

have
not
Miss
Crawford
a
gown
something
the

"
  
<EOS>
in
approach
the
Parsonage
they
pass
close
by
the
stable

yard

house

"
Heyday

I
shall
be
very
glad

him

"
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
occasion
,
there
be
no
time
for
Fanny
to
say
how
very
differently
she
feel
;
but
the
idea
of
have
such
another
to
observe
her
be
a
great
increase
of
the
trepidation
with
which
she
perform
the
very
awful
ceremony
of
walk
into
the
drawing

room
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
drawing

room
Mr.
Crawford
certainly
be
,
have
be
just
long
enough
arrive
to
be
ready
for
dinner
;
and
the
smile
and
pleased
look
of
the
three
other
stand
round
him
,
shew
how
welcome
be
his
sudden
resolution
of
come
to
them
for
a
few
day
on
leave
Bath
.
<EOS>
a
very
cordial
meeting
pass
between
him
and
Edmund
;
and
with
the
exception
of
Fanny
,
the
pleasure
be
general
;
and
even
to
_
her
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
there
may
be
some
advantage
in
his
presence
,
since
every
addition
to
the
party
must
rather
forward
her
favourite
indulgence
of
be
suffer
to
sit
silent
and
unattended
to
.
<EOS>
She
be
soon
aware
of
this
herself
;
for
though
she
must
submit
,
as
her
own
propriety
of
mind
direct
,
in
spite
of
her
aunt
Norris
's
opinion
,
to
be
the
principal
lady
in
company
,
and
to
all
the
little
distinction
<EOS>
consequent
thereon
<EOS>
,
she
find
,
while
they
be
at
table
,
such
a
happy
flow
of
conversation
prevailing
,
in
which
she
be
not
require
to
take
any
part
 
<EOS>
there
be
so
much
to
be
say
between
the
brother
and
sister
about
Bath
,
so
much
between
the
two
young
man
about
hunting
,
so
much
of
politic
between
Mr.
Crawford
and
Dr.
Grant
,
and
of
everything
and
all
together
between
Mr.
Crawford
and
Mrs.
Grant
,
as
to
leave
her
the
fair
prospect
of
have
only
to
listen
in
quiet
,
and
of
pass
a
very
agreeable
day
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
compliment
the
newly
arrive
gentleman
,
however
,
with
any
appearance
of
interest
,
in
a
scheme
for
extend
his
stay
at
Mansfield
,
and
send
for
his
hunter
from
Norfolk
,
which
,
suggest
by
Dr.
Grant
,
advise
by
Edmund
,
and
warmly
urge
by
the
two
sister
,
be
soon
in
possession
of
his
mind
,
and
which
he
seem
to
want
to
be
encourage
even
by
her
to
resolve
on
.
<EOS>
Her
opinion
be
seek
as
to
the
probable
continuance
of
the
open
weather
,
but
her
answer
be
as
short
and
indifferent
as
civility
allow
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
wish
him
to
stay
,
and
would
much
rather
not
have
him
speak
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
Her
two
absent
cousin
,
especially
Maria
,
be
much
in
her
thought
on
see
him
;
but
no
embarrassing
remembrance
affect
_
his
_
spirit
.
<EOS>
here
he
be
again
on
the
same
ground
where
all
have
pass
before
,
and
apparently
as
willing
to
stay
and
be
happy
without
the
Miss
Bertrams
,
as
if
he
have
never
know
Mansfield
in
any
other
state
.
<EOS>
She
hear
them
speak
of
by
him
only
in
a
general
way
,
till
they
be
all
re
-
assemble
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
when
Edmund
,
be
engage
apart
in
some
matter
of
business
with
Dr.
Grant
,
which
seem
entirely
to
engross
them
,
and
Mrs.
Grant
occupy
at
the
tea
-
table
,
he
begin
talk
of
them
with
more
particularity
to
his
other
sister
.
<EOS>
with
a
significant
smile
,
which
make
Fanny
quite
hate
him
,
he
say
,
"
<EOS>
so
!
<EOS>
Rushworth
and
his

bride

at
Brighton

I
understand
;
happy

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
they
have
be
there
about
a
fortnight
,
Miss
Price
,
<EOS>
have
they
not

<EOS>
and
Julia
be
with
them
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
Mr.

,
I

,
be
not
far
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Yates
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
we
hear
nothing
of
Mr.
Yates

<EOS>
I
do
not
imagine
he
figure
much
in
the
letter
to
Mansfield
Park
;
do
you
,
Miss
Price
?
<EOS>
I
think
my
friend
Julia
know
well
than
to
entertain
her
father
with
Mr.
Yates
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor

Crawford
.
<EOS>
"
nobody

<EOS>
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
I
see
him
now
 
his
toil
and
his
despair
.
<EOS>
well
,
I
be
much
mistaken
if
his
lovely
Maria
will
ever
want
him
to
make
two
-
and
-
forty
speech
to
her
"
;
add
,
with
a
momentary
seriousness
,
"
She
be
too
good
for
him
 
much
too
good
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
change
his
tone
again
to
one
of
gentle
gallantry
,
and
address
Fanny
,
he
say
,
"
You
be
Mr.
Rushworth
's
good
friend

<EOS>
Your
kindness
and
patience
can
never
be
forget

your
indefatigable
patience
in
try
to
make
it
possible
for
him
to
learn
his
part
 
in
try
to
give
him
a
brain
which
nature
have
deny
 
to
mix
up
an
understanding
for
him
out
of
the
superfluity
of
your
own
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
may
not
have
sense
enough
himself
to
estimate
your
kindness
,
but
I
may
venture
to
say
that
it
have
honour
from
all
the
rest
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
coloured
,
and
say
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
as
a
dream
,
a
pleasant
dream
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
,
break
forth
again
,
after
a
few
minute
'
musing
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
always
look
back
on
our
theatrical
with
exquisite
pleasure

<EOS>
there
be
such
an
interest

such
an
animation
,
such
a
spirit
diffuse
.
<EOS>
everybody
feel
it

We
be
all
alive

<EOS>
there
be
employment
,
hope
,
solicitude
,
bustle
,
for
every
hour
of
the
day

<EOS>
always
some
little
objection

some
little
doubt

some
little
anxiety

be
get
over

I
never
be
happy

<EOS>
with
silent
indignation
Fanny
repeat
to
herself
,
"
never

<EOS>
never
happy
than
when
do
what
you
must
know
be

justifiable

<EOS>
never

what
a
corrupt
mind

<EOS>

We
be
unlucky

Miss
Price

he
continue
,
in
a
low
tone
,
to
avoid
the
possibility
of
be
hear
by
Edmund
,
and
not
at
all
aware
of
her
feeling
,
"
we
certainly
be
very
unlucky
.
<EOS>
another
week
,
only
one
other
week
,
would
have
be
enough
for
us
.
<EOS>
I
think
if
we
have
have
the
disposal
of
event
 
if
Mansfield
Park
have
have
the
government
of
the
wind
just
for
a
week

two
,
about
the
equinox

there
would
have
be
a
difference

<EOS>
not
that
we
would
have
endanger
his
safety
by
any
tremendous
weather
 
but
only
by
a
steady
contrary
wind
,
or
a
calm
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
Miss
Price
,
we
would
have
indulge
ourselves
with
a
week
's
calm
in
the
Atlantic
at
that
season
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
seem
determined
to
be
answer
;
and
Fanny
,
avert
her
face
,
say
,
with
a
firm
tone
than
usual
,
"
as
far
as
_
I
_
be
concern
,
sir
,
I
would
not
have
delay
his
return
for
a
day
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
disapprove
it
all
so
entirely
when
he
do
arrive
,
that
in
my
opinion
everything
have
go
quite
far
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
have
never
speak
so
much
at
once
to
him
in
her
life
before
,
and
never
so
angrily
to
any
one
;
and
when
her
speech
be
over
,
she
tremble
and
blush
at
her
own
daring
.
<EOS>
He
be
surprised
;
but
after
a
few
moment
'
silent
consideration
of
her
,
reply
in
a
calmer
,
graver
tone
,
and
as
if
the
candid
result
of
conviction
,
"
I
believe
you
be
right
.
<EOS>
It
be
more
pleasant
than
prudent
.
<EOS>
We
be
get
too
noisy
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
turn
the
conversation
,
he
would
have
engage
her
on
some
other
subject
,
but
her
answer
be
so
shy
and
reluctant
that
he
could
not
advance
in
any
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
,
who
have
be
repeatedly
eye
Dr.
Grant
and
Edmund
,
now
observe
,
"
those
gentleman
must
have
some
very
interesting
point
to
discuss
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
most
interesting
in
the
world
,
"
reply
her
brother
 
"
how
to
make
money
;
how
to
turn
a
good
income
into
a
well
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grant
be
give
Bertram
instruction
about
the
living
<EOS>
he
be
to
step
into
so
soon
.
<EOS>
I
find
he
take
order
in
a
few
week
.
<EOS>
They
be
at
it
in
the
dining
-
parlour
.
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
hear
Bertram
will
be
so
well
off
.
<EOS>
He
will
have
a
very
pretty
income
to
make
duck
and
drake
with
,
and
earn
without
much
trouble
.
<EOS>
I
apprehend
he
will
not
have
less
than
seven
hundred
a
year
.
<EOS>
seven
hundred
a
year
be
a
fine
thing
for
a
young
brother
;
and
as
of
course
he
will
still
live
at
home
,
it
will
be
all
for
his
_
menus
_
_
plaisir
_
;
and
a
sermon
at
Christmas
and
Easter
,
I
suppose
,
will
be
the
sum
total
of
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
sister
try
to
laugh
off
her
feeling
by
say
,
"
nothing
amuse
me
more
than
the
easy
manner
with
which
everybody
settle
the
abundance
of
those
who
have
a
great
deal
less
than
themselves
.
<EOS>
You
would
look
rather
blank
,
<EOS>
Henry
,
if
your
_
menus

_
_
plaisir

be
to
be
limit
to
seven
hundred

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
may
;
but
all
_
<EOS>
that
_
you
know
be
entirely
comparative
.
<EOS>
birthright
and
habit
must
settle
the
business
.
<EOS>
Bertram
be
certainly
well
off
for
a
cadet
of
even
a
baronet
's
family
.
<EOS>
by
the
time
he
be
four
or
five
and
twenty
he
will
have
seven
hundred
a
year
,
and
nothing
to
do
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
_
could
_
have
say
that
there
would
be
a
something
to
do
and
to
suffer
for
it
,
which
she
could
not
think
lightly
of
;
but
she
check
herself
and
let
it
pass
;
and
try
to
look
calm
and
unconcerned
when
the
two
gentleman
shortly
afterwards
join
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bertram
,
"
say
Henry
Crawford

I

be
it
to

<EOS>
Miss
Price
,
will
not
you
join
me
in
encourage
your
cousin
?
<EOS>
Will
not
you
engage
to
attend
with
your
eye
steadily
fix
on
him
the
whole
time
 
as
I
shall
do
 
not
to
lose
a
word
;
or
only
look
off
just
to
note
down
any
sentence
preeminently
beautiful
?
<EOS>
We
will
provide
ourselves
with
tablet
and
a
pencil
.
<EOS>
when
will
it
be
?
<EOS>
You
must
preach
at
Mansfield
,
you
know
,
that
Sir
Thomas
and
Lady
Bertram
may
hear
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
keep
clear
of
you
,
Crawford
,
as
long
as
I
can
,
"
say
Edmund
;
"
for
you
would
be
more
likely
to
disconcert
me
,
and
I
should
be
more
sorry
to
see
you
try
at
it
than
almost
any
other
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
he
not
feel
this
?
"
think
Fanny
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
he
can
feel
nothing
as
he
ought
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
party
be
now
all
unite
,
and
the
chief
talker
attract
each
other
,
she
remain
in
tranquillity
;
and
as
a
whist
-
table
be
form
after
tea
 
form
really
for
the
amusement
of
Dr.
Grant
,
by
his
attentive
wife
,
though
it
be
not
to
be
suppose
<EOS>
so
 
and
Miss
Crawford
take
her
harp
,
she
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
listen
;
and
her
tranquillity
remain
undisturbed
the
rest
of
the
evening
,
except
when
Mr.
Crawford
now
and
then
address
to
her
a
question
or
observation
,
which
she
could
not
avoid
answer
.
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
be
too
much
vex
by
what
have
pass
to
be
in
a
humour
for
anything
but
music
.
<EOS>
with
that
she
soothe
herself
and
amuse
her
friend
.
  
<EOS>
the
assurance
of
Edmund
's
be
so
soon
to
take
order
,
come
upon
her
like
a
blow
that
have
be
suspend
,
and
still
hope
uncertain
and
at
a
distance
,
be
feel
with
resentment
and
mortification
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
angry
with
him
.
<EOS>
She
have
think
her
influence
more
.
<EOS>
She
_
have
_
begin
to
think
of
him
;
she
feel
that
she
have
,
with
great
regard
,
with
almost
decide
intention
;
but
she
would
now
meet
him
with
his
own
cool
feeling
.
<EOS>
It
be
plain
that
he
could
have
no
serious
view
,
no
true
attachment
,
by
fix
himself
in
a
situation
which
he
must
know
she
would
never
stoop
to
.
<EOS>
She
would
learn
to
match
him
in
his
indifference
.
<EOS>
She
would
henceforth
admit
his
attention
without
any
idea
beyond
immediate
amusement
.
<EOS>
if
_
he
_
could
so
command
his
affection
,
_
her
_
should
do
her
no
harm

<EOS>
Henry
Crawford
have
quite
make
up
his
mind
by
the
next
morning
to
give
another
fortnight
to
Mansfield
,
and
have
send
for
his
hunter
,
and
write
a
few
line
of
explanation
to
the
Admiral
,
he
look
round
at
his
sister
as
he
seal
and
throw
the
letter
from
him
,
and
see
the
coast
clear
of
the
rest
of
the
family
,
say
,
with
a
smile
,
"
and
<EOS>
how
do
you
think
I
mean
to
amuse
myself
,
Mary
,
on
the
day
that
I
do
not
hunt
?
<EOS>
I
be
grow
too
old
to
go
out
more
than
three
time
a
week
;
but
I
have
a
plan
for
the
intermediate
day
,
and
what
do
you
think
it
be
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
to
walk
and
ride
with
me
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
exactly
,
though
I
shall
be
happy
to
do
both
,
but
_
that
_
would
be
exercise
only
to
my
body
,
and
I
must
take
care
of
my
mind
.
<EOS>
besides
,
_
that
_
would
be
all
recreation
and
indulgence
,
without
the
wholesome
alloy
of
labour
,
and
I
do
not
like
to
eat
the
bread
of
idleness
.
<EOS>
no
,
my
plan
be
to
make
Fanny
Price
in
love
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fanny
Price
!
<EOS>
nonsense
!
<EOS>
no
,
no
.
<EOS>
You
ought
to
be
satisfied
with
her
two
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
can
not
be
satisfied
without
Fanny
Price
,
without
make
a
small
hole
in
Fanny
Price
's
heart
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
seem
properly
aware
of
her
claim
to
notice
.
<EOS>
when
we
talk
of
her
last
night
,
you
none
of
you
seem
sensible
of
the
wonderful
improvement
that
have
take
place
in
her
look
within
the
last
six
week
.
<EOS>
You
see
her
every
day
,
and
therefore
do
not
notice
it
;
but
I
assure
you
she
be
quite
a
different
creature
from
what
she
be
in
the
autumn
.
<EOS>
She
be
then
merely
a
quiet
,
modest
,
not
plain
-
look
girl
,
but
she
be
now
absolutely
pretty
.
<EOS>
I
use
to
think
she
have
neither
complexion
nor
countenance
;
but
in
that
soft
skin
of
her
,
so
frequently
tinge
with
a
blush
as
it
be
yesterday
,
there
be
decide
beauty
;
and
from
what
I
observe
of
her
eye
and
mouth
,
I
do
not
despair
of
their
be
capable
of
expression
enough
when
she
have
anything
to
express
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
her
air
,
her
manner
,
her
_
tout
<EOS>
_
_
ensemble
_
,
be
so
indescribably
improve
!
<EOS>
She
must
be
grow
two
inch
,
at
least
,
since
October
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Phoo
!
phoo
!
<EOS>
this
be
only
because
there
be
no
tall
woman
to
compare
her
with
,
and
because
she
have
get
a
new
gown
,
and
you
never
see
her
so
well
dress
before
.
<EOS>
She
be
just
what
she
be
in
October
,
believe
me
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
that
she
be
the
only
girl
in
company
for
you
to
notice
,
and
you
must
have
a
somebody
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
think
<EOS>
her
pretty
 
not
strikingly
pretty
 
<EOS>
but
"
pretty
enough
,
"
as
people
say
;
<EOS>
a
sort
of
beauty
that
grow
on
one
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
should
be
dark
,
but
she
have
a
sweet
smile
;
but
as
for
this
wonderful
degree
of
improvement
,
I
be
sure
it
may
all
be
resolve
into
a
well
style
of
dress
,
and
your
have
nobody
else
to
look
at
;
and
therefore
,
if
you
do
set
about
a
flirtation
with
her
,
you
never
will
persuade
me
that
it
be
in
compliment
to
her
beauty
,
or
that
it
proceed
from
anything
but
your
own
idleness
and
folly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
brother
give
only
a
smile
to
this
accusation
,
and
soon
afterwards
say
,
"
I
do
not
quite
know
what
to
make
of
Miss
Fanny
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
her
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
tell
what
she
would
be
at
yesterday
.
<EOS>
what
be
her
character
?
<EOS>
be
she
solemn
?
<EOS>
be
she
queer
?
<EOS>
be
she
prudish
?
<EOS>
why
do
she
draw
back
and
look
so
grave
at
me
?
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
get
her
to
speak
.
<EOS>
I
never
be
so
long
in
company
with
a
girl
in
my
life
,
try
to
entertain
her
,
and
succeed
so
ill
!
<EOS>
never
meet
with
a
girl
who
look
so
grave
on
me
!
<EOS>
I
must
try
to
get
the
well
of
this
.
<EOS>
Her
look
say
,
"
I
will
not
like
you
,
I
be
determine
not
to
like
you
"
;
and
I
say
she
shall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
foolish
fellow
!
<EOS>
and
so
this
be
her
attraction
after
all
!
<EOS>
this
it
be
,
her
not
care
about
you
,
which
give
her
such
a
soft
skin
,
and
make
her
so
much
tall
,
and
produce
all
these
charm
and
grace
!
<EOS>
I
do
desire
that
you
will
not
be
make
her
really
unhappy
;
a
_
little
_
love
,
perhaps
,
may
animate
and
do
her
good
,
but
I
will
not
have
you
plunge
her
deep
,
for
she
be
as
good
a
little
creature
as
ever
live
,
and
have
a
great
deal
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
can
be
but
for
a
fortnight
,
"
say
Henry
;
"
and
if
a
fortnight
can
kill
her
,
she
must
have
a
constitution
which
nothing
could
save
.
<EOS>
no
,
I
will
not
do
her
any
harm
,
dear
little
soul
!
<EOS>
only
want
her
to
look
kindly
on
me
,
to
give
me
smile
as
well
as
blush
,
to
keep
a
chair
for
me
by
herself
wherever
we
be
,
and
be
all
animation
when
I
take
it
and
talk
to
her
;
to
think
as
I
think
,
be
interested
in
all
my
possession
and
pleasure
,
try
to
keep
me
longer
at
Mansfield
,
and
feel
when
I
go
away
that
she
shall
be
never
happy
again
.
<EOS>
I
want
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
moderation
itself
!
"
say
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
have
no
scruple
now
.
<EOS>
well
,
you
will
have
opportunity
enough
of
endeavour
to
recommend
yourself
,
for
we
be
a
great
deal
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
without
attempt
any
farther
remonstrance
,
she
leave
Fanny
to
her
fate
,
a
fate
which
,
have
not
Fanny
's
heart
be
guard
in
a
way
unsuspected
by
Miss
Crawford
,
may
have
be
a
little
harder
than
she
deserve
;
for
although
there
doubtless
be
such
unconquerable
young
lady
of
eighteen
(
or
one
should
not
read
about
them
)
as
be
never
to
be
persuade
into
love
against
their
judgment
by
all
that
talent
,
manner
,
attention
,
and
flattery
can
do
,
I
have
no
inclination
to
believe
Fanny
one
of
them
,
or
to
think
that
with
so
much
tenderness
of
disposition
,
and
so
much
taste
as
belong
to
her
,
she
could
have
escape
heart
-
whole
from
the
courtship
(
though
the
courtship
only
of
a
fortnight
)
of
such
a
man
as
Crawford
,
in
spite
of
there
be
some
previous
ill
opinion
of
him
to
be
overcome
,
have
not
her
affection
be
engage
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
with
all
the
security
which
love
of
another
and
disesteem
of
him
could
give
to
the
peace
of
mind
he
be
attack
,
his
continued
attention
 
continue
,
but
not
obtrusive
,
and
adapt
themselves
more
and
more
to
the
gentleness
and
delicacy
of
her
character
 
oblige
her
very
soon
to
dislike
him
less
than
formerly
.
<EOS>
She
have
by
no
mean
forget
the
past
,
and
she
think
as
ill
of
him
as
ever
;
but
she
feel
his
power
:
he
be
entertain
;
and
his
manner
be
so
improved
,
so
polite
,
so
seriously
and
blamelessly
polite
,
that
it
be
impossible
not
to
be
civil
to
him
in
return
.
  
<EOS>
a
very
few
day
be
enough
to
effect
this
;
and
at
the
end
of
those
few
day
,
circumstance
arise
which
have
a
tendency
rather
to
forward
his
view
of
please
her
,
inasmuch
as
they
give
her
a
degree
of
happiness
which
must
dispose
her
to
be
pleased
with
everybody
.
<EOS>
William
,
her
brother
,
the
so
long
absent
and
dearly
love
brother
,
be
in
England
again
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
letter
from
him
herself
,
a
few
hurried
happy
line
,
write
as
the
ship
come
up
Channel
,
and
send
into
Portsmouth
with
the
first
boat
that
leave
the
Antwerp
at
anchor
in
Spithead
;
and
when
Crawford
walk
up
with
the
newspaper
in
his
hand
,
which
he
have
hope
would
bring
the
first
tiding
,
he
find
her
tremble
with
joy
over
this
letter
,
and
listen
with
a
glowing
,
grateful
countenance
to
the
kind
invitation
which
her
uncle
be
most
collectedly
dictate
in
reply
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
<EOS>
but
the
day
before
that
Crawford
have
make
himself
thoroughly
master
of
the
subject
,
or
have
in
fact
become
at
all
aware
of
her
have
such
a
brother
,
or
his
being
in
such
a
ship
,
but
the
interest
then
excite
<EOS>
have
be
very
properly
lively
,
determine
him
on
his
return
to
town
to
apply
for
information
as
to
the
probable
period
of
the
Antwerp
's
return
from
the
Mediterranean
,
etc
.
;
and
the
good
luck
which
attend
his
early
examination
of
ship
news
the
next
morning
seem
the
reward
of
his
ingenuity
in
find
out
such
a
method
of
please
her
,
as
well
as
of
his
dutiful
attention
to
the
Admiral
,
in
have
for
many
year
take
in
the
paper
esteem
to
have
the
early
naval
intelligence
.
<EOS>
He
prove
,
however
,
to
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
all
those
fine
first
feeling
,
of
which
he
have
hope
to
be
the
exciter
,
be
already
give
.
<EOS>
but
his
intention
,
the
kindness
of
his
intention
,
be
thankfully
acknowledge
:
quite
thankfully
and
warmly
,
for
she
be
elevate
beyond
the
common
timidity
of
her
mind
by
the
flow
of
her
love
for
William
.
  
<EOS>
this
dear
William
would
soon
be
amongst
them
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
his
obtain
leave
of
absence
immediately
,
for
he
be
still
only
a
midshipman
;
and
as
his
parent
,
from
live
on
the
spot
,
must
already
have
see
him
,
and
be
see
him
perhaps
daily
,
his
direct
holiday
may
with
justice
be
instantly
give
to
the
sister
,
who
have
be
his
good
correspondent
through
a
period
of
seven
year
,
and
the
uncle
who
have
do
most
for
his
support
and
advancement
;
and
accordingly
the
reply
to
her
reply
,
fix
a
very
early
day
for
his
arrival
,
come
as
soon
as
possible
;
and
scarcely
ten
day
have
pass
since
Fanny
have
be
in
the
agitation
of
her
first
dinner
-
visit
,
when
she
find
herself
in
an
agitation
of
a
high
nature
,
watch
in
the
hall
,
in
the
lobby
,
on
the
stair
,
for
the
first
sound
of
the
carriage
which
be
to
bring
her
a
brother
.
  
<EOS>
It
come
happily
while
she
be
thus
wait
;
and
there
be
neither
ceremony
nor
fearfulness
to
delay
the
moment
of
meeting
,
she
be
with
him
as
he
enter
the
house
,
and
the
first
minute
of
exquisite
feeling
have
no
interruption
and
no
witness
,
unless
the
servant
chiefly
intent
upon
open
the
proper
door
could
be
call
such
.
<EOS>
this
be
exactly
what
Sir
Thomas
and
Edmund
have
be
separately
connive
at
,
as
each
prove
to
the
other
by
the
sympathetic
alacrity
with
which
they
both
advise
Mrs.
Norris
's
continue
where
she
be
,
instead
of
rush
out
into
the
hall
as
soon
as
the
noise
of
the
arrival
reach
them
.
  
<EOS>
William
and
Fanny
soon
shew
themselves
;
and
Sir
Thomas
have
the
pleasure
of
receiving
,
in
his
protege
,
certainly
a
very
different
person
from
the
one
he
have
equip
seven
year
ago
,
but
a
young
man
of
an
open
,
pleasant
countenance
,
and
frank
,
unstudied
,
but
feeling
and
respectful
manner
,
and
such
as
confirm
him
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
long
before
Fanny
could
recover
from
the
agitate
happiness
of
such
an
hour
as
be
form
by
the
last
thirty
minute
of
expectation
,
and
the
first
of
fruition
;
it
be
some
time
even
before
her
happiness
could
be
say
to
make
her
happy
,
before
the
disappointment
inseparable
from
the
alteration
of
person
have
vanish
,
and
she
could
see
in
him
the
same
William
as
before
,
and
talk
to
him
,
as
her
heart
have
be
yearn
to
do
through
many
a
past
year
.
<EOS>
that
time
,
however
,
do
gradually
come
,
forward
by
an
affection
on
his
side
as
warm
as
her
own
,
and
much
less
encumber
by
refinement
or
self
-
distrust
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
first
object
of
his
love
,
but
it
be
a
love
which
his
strong
spirit
,
and
bold
temper
,
make
it
as
natural
for
him
to
express
as
to
feel
.
<EOS>
on
the
morrow
they
be
walk
about
together
with
true
enjoyment
,
and
every
succeed
morrow
renew
a
_
tete
-
a
-
tete
_
which
Sir
Thomas
could
not
but
observe
with
complacency
,
even
before
Edmund
have
point
it
out
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
except
the
moment
of
peculiar
delight
,
which
any
marked
or
unlooke
-
for
instance
of
Edmund
's
consideration
of
her
in
the
last
few
month
have
excite
,
Fanny
have
never
know
so
much
felicity
in
her
life
,
as
in
this
unchecked
,
equal
,
fearless
intercourse
with
the
brother
and
friend
who
be
open
all
his
heart
to
her
,
tell
her
all
his
hope
and
fear
,
plan
,
and
solicitude
respect
that
long
thought
of
,
dearly
earn
,
and
justly
value
blessing
of
promotion
;
who
could
give
her
direct
and
minute
information
of
the
father
and
mother
,
brother
and
sister
,
of
whom
she
very
seldom
hear
;
who
be
interested
in
all
the
comfort
and
all
the
little
hardship
of
her
home
at
Mansfield
;
ready
to
think
of
every
member
of
that
home
as
she
direct
,
or
differ
only
by
a
less
scrupulous
opinion
,
and
more
noisy
abuse
of
their
aunt
Norris
,
and
with
whom
(
perhaps
the
dear
indulgence
of
the
whole
)
<EOS>
all
the
evil
and
good
of
their
early
year
could
be
go
over
again
,
and
every
former
united
pain
and
pleasure
retrace
with
the
fond
recollection
.
<EOS>
an
advantage
this
,
a
strengthener
of
love
,
in
which
even
the
conjugal
tie
be
beneath
the
fraternal
.
<EOS>
child
of
the
same
family
,
the
same
blood
,
with
the
same
first
association
and
habit
,
have
some
mean
of
enjoyment
in
their
power
,
which
no
subsequent
connexion
can
supply
;
and
it
must
be
by
a
long
and
unnatural
estrangement
,
by
a
divorce
which
no
subsequent
connexion
can
justify
,
if
such
precious
remain
of
the
early
attachment
be
ever
entirely
outlive
.
<EOS>
too
often
,
alas
!
<EOS>
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
fraternal
love
,
sometimes
almost
everything
,
be
at
other
bad
than
nothing
.
<EOS>
but
with
William
and
Fanny
Price
it
be
still
a
sentiment
in
all
its
prime
and
freshness
,
wound
by
no
opposition
of
interest
,
cool
by
no
separate
attachment
,
and
feel
the
influence
of
time
and
absence
only
in
its
increase
.
  
<EOS>
an
affection
so
amiable
be
advance
each
in
the
opinion
of
all
who
have
heart
to
value
anything
good
.
<EOS>
Henry
Crawford
be
as
much
strike
with
it
as
any
.
<EOS>
He
honour
the
warm
-
hearted
,
blunt
fondness
of
the
young
sailor
,
which
lead
him
to
say
,
with
his
hand
stretch
towards
Fanny
's
head
,
"
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
I
begin
to
like
that
queer
fashion
already
,
though
when
I
first
hear
of
such
thing
be
do
in
England
,
I
could
not
believe
it
;
and
when
Mrs.
Brown
,
and
the
other
woman
at
the
Commissioner
's
at
Gibraltar
,
appear
in
the
same
trim
,
I
think
they
be
mad
;
but
Fanny
can
reconcile
me
to
anything
"
;
and
see
,
with
lively
admiration
,
the
glow
of
Fanny
's
cheek
,
the
brightness
of
her
eye
,
the
deep
interest
,
the
absorb
attention
,
while
her
brother
be
describe
any
of
the
imminent
hazard
,
or
terrific
scene
,
which
such
a
period
at
sea
must
supply
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
picture
which
Henry
Crawford
have
moral
taste
enough
to
value
.
<EOS>
Fanny
's
attraction
increase
 
increase
twofold
;
for
the
sensibility
which
beautify
her
complexion
and
illumine
her
countenance
be
an
attraction
in
itself
.
<EOS>
He
be
no
longer
in
doubt
of
the
capability
of
her
heart
.
<EOS>
She
have
feeling
,
genuine
feeling
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
something
to
be
love
by
such
a
girl
,
to
excite
the
first
ardour
of
her
young
unsophisticated
mind
!
<EOS>
She
interest
him
more
than
he
have
foresee
.
<EOS>
a
fortnight
be
not
enough
.
<EOS>
His
stay
become
indefinite
.
  
<EOS>
William
be
often
call
on
by
his
uncle
to
be
the
talker
.
<EOS>
His
recital
be
amusing
in
themselves
to
Sir
Thomas
,
but
the
chief
object
in
seek
them
be
to
understand
the
reciter
,
to
know
the
young
man
by
his
history
;
and
he
listen
to
his
clear
,
simple
,
spirited
detail
with
full
satisfaction
,
see
in
them
the
proof
of
good
principle
,
professional
knowledge
,
energy
,
courage
,
and
cheerfulness
,
everything
that
could
deserve
or
promise
well
.
<EOS>
young
as
he
be
,
William
have
already
see
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
in
the
Mediterranean
;
in
the
West
Indies
;
in
the
Mediterranean
again
;
have
be
often
take
on
shore
by
the
favour
of
his
captain
,
and
in
the
course
of
seven
year
have
know
every
variety
of
danger
which
sea
and
war
together
could
offer
.
<EOS>
with
such
mean
in
his
power
he
have
a
right
to
be
listen
to
;
and
though
Mrs.
Norris
could
fidget
about
the
room
,
and
disturb
everybody
in
quest
of
two
needleful
of
thread
or
a
second
-
hand
shirt
button
,
in
the
midst
of
her
nephew
's
account
of
a
shipwreck
or
an
engagement
,
everybody
else
be
attentive
;
and
even
Lady
Bertram
could
not
hear
of
such
horror
unmoved
,
or
without
sometimes
lift
her
eye
from
her
work
to
say
,
"
dear
me
!
<EOS>
how
disagreeable
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
anybody
can
ever
go
to
sea
.
"
  
<EOS>
to
Henry
Crawford
they
give
a
different
feeling
.
<EOS>
He
long
to
have
be
at
sea
,
and
see
and
do
and
suffer
as
much
.
<EOS>
His
heart
be
warm
,
his
fancy
fire
,
and
he
feel
the
high
respect
for
a
lad
who
,
before
he
be
twenty
,
have
go
through
such
bodily
hardship
and
give
such
proof
of
mind
.
<EOS>
the
glory
of
heroism
,
of
usefulness
,
of
exertion
,
of
endurance
,
make
his
own
habit
of
selfish
indulgence
appear
in
shameful
contrast
;
and
he
wish
he
have
be
a
William
Price
,
distinguish
himself
and
work
his
way
to
fortune
and
consequence
with
so
much
self
-
respect
and
happy
ardour
,
instead
of
what
he
be
!
  
<EOS>
the
wish
be
rather
eager
than
last
.
<EOS>
He
be
rouse
from
the
reverie
of
retrospection
and
regret
produce
by
it
,
by
some
inquiry
from
Edmund
as
to
his
plan
for
the
next
day
's
hunting
;
and
he
find
it
be
as
well
to
be
a
man
of
fortune
at
once
with
horse
and
groom
at
his
command
.
<EOS>
in
one
respect
it
be
well
,
as
it
give
him
the
mean
of
confer
a
kindness
where
he
wish
to
oblige
.
<EOS>
with
spirit
,
courage
,
and
curiosity
up
to
anything
,
William
express
an
inclination
to
hunt
;
and
Crawford
could
mount
him
without
the
slight
inconvenience
to
himself
,
and
with
only
some
scruple
to
obviate
in
Sir
Thomas
,
who
know
better
than
his
nephew
the
value
of
such
a
loan
,
and
some
alarm
to
reason
away
in
Fanny
.
<EOS>
She
fear
for
William
;
by
no
mean
convince
by
all
that
he
could
relate
of
his
own
horsemanship
in
various
country
,
of
the
scramble
party
in
which
he
have
be
engage
,
the
rough
horse
and
mule
he
have
ride
,
or
his
many
narrow
escape
from
dreadful
fall
,
that
he
be
at
all
equal
to
the
management
of
a
high
-
fed
hunter
in
an
English
fox
-
chase
;
nor
till
he
return
safe
and
well
,
without
accident
or
discredit
,
could
she
be
reconcile
to
the
risk
,
or
feel
any
of
that
obligation
to
Mr.
Crawford
for
lend
the
horse
which
he
have
fully
intend
it
should
produce
.
<EOS>
when
it
be
prove
,
however
,
to
have
do
William
no
harm
,
she
could
allow
it
to
be
a
kindness
,
and
even
reward
the
owner
with
a
smile
when
the
animal
be
one
minute
tender
to
his
use
again
;
and
the
next
,
with
the
great
cordiality
,
and
in
a
manner
not
to
be
resist
,
make
over
to
his
use
entirely
so
long
as
he
remain
in
Northamptonshire
.
    
<EOS>
the
intercourse
of
the
two
family
be
at
this
period
more
nearly
restore
to
what
it
have
be
in
the
autumn
,
than
any
member
of
the
old
intimacy
have
think
ever
likely
to
be
again
.
<EOS>
the
return
of
Henry
Crawford
,
and
the
arrival
of
William
Price
,
have
much
to
do
with
it
,
but
much
be
still
owe
to
Sir
Thomas
's
more
than
toleration
of
the
neighbourly
attempt
at
the
Parsonage
.
<EOS>
His
mind
,
now
disengage
from
the
care
which
have
press
on
him
at
first
,
be
at
leisure
to
find
the
Grants
and
their
young
inmate
really
worth
visit
;
and
though
infinitely
above
scheme
or
contrive
for
any
the
most
advantageous
matrimonial
establishment
that
could
be
among
the
apparent
possibility
of
any
one
most
dear
to
him
,
and
disdain
even
as
a
littleness
the
be
quick
-
sight
on
such
point
,
he
could
not
avoid
perceive
,
in
a
grand
and
careless
way
,
that
Mr.
Crawford
be
somewhat
distinguish
his
niece
 
nor
perhaps
refrain
(
though
unconsciously
)
from
give
a
more
willing
assent
to
invitation
on
that
account
.
  
<EOS>
His
readiness
,
however
,
in
agree
to
dine
at
the
Parsonage
,
when
the
general
invitation
be
at
last
hazard
,
after
many
debate
and
many
doubt
as
to
whether
it
be
worth
while
,
"
because
Sir
Thomas
seem
so
ill
inclined
,
and
Lady
Bertram
be
so
indolent
!
"
<EOS>
proceed
from
good
-
breeding
and
goodwill
alone
,
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
Mr.
Crawford
,
but
as
be
one
in
an
agreeable
group
:
for
it
be
in
the
course
of
that
very
visit
that
he
first
begin
to
think
that
any
one
in
the
habit
of
such
idle
observation
_
would
<EOS>
_
_
have
<EOS>
_
_
think
_
that
Mr.
Crawford
be
the
admirer
of
Fanny
Price
.
  
<EOS>
the
meeting
be
generally
feel
to
be
a
pleasant
one
,
be
compose
in
a
good
proportion
of
those
who
would
talk
and
those
who
would
listen
;
and
the
dinner
itself
be
elegant
and
plentiful
,
accord
to
the
usual
style
of
the
Grants
,
and
too
much
accord
to
the
usual
habit
of
all
to
raise
any
emotion
except
in
Mrs.
Norris
,
who
could
never
behold
either
the
wide
table
or
the
number
of
dish
on
it
with
patience
,
and
who
do
always
contrive
to
experience
some
evil
from
the
passing
of
the
servant
behind
her
chair
,
and
to
bring
away
some
fresh
conviction
of
its
be
impossible
among
so
many
dish
but
that
some
must
be
cold
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
evening
it
be
find
,
accord
to
the
predetermination
of
Mrs.
Grant
and
her
sister
,
that
after
make
up
the
whist
-
table
there
would
remain
sufficient
for
a
round
game
,
and
everybody
be
as
perfectly
comply
and
without
a
choice
as
on
such
occasion
<EOS>
they
always
be
,
speculation
be
decide
on
almost
as
soon
as
whist
;
and
Lady
Bertram
soon
find
herself
in
the
critical
situation
of
be
apply
to
for
her
own
choice
between
the
game
,
and
be
require
either
to
draw
a
card
for
whist
or
not
.
<EOS>
She
hesitate
.
<EOS>
luckily
Sir
Thomas
be
at
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
shall
I
do
,
Sir
Thomas
?
<EOS>
Whist
and
speculation
;
which
will
amuse
me
most
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
,
after
a
moment
's
thought
,
recommend
speculation
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
whist
player
himself
,
and
perhaps
may
feel
that
it
would
not
much
amuse
him
to
have
her
for
a
partner
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
be
her
ladyship
's
contented
answer
;
"
then
speculation
,
if
you
please
,
Mrs.
Grant
.
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
about
it
,
but
Fanny
must
teach
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
Fanny
interpose
,
however
,
with
anxious
protestation
of
her
own
equal
ignorance
;
she
have
never
play
the
game
nor
see
it
play
in
her
life
;
and
Lady
Bertram
feel
a
moment
's
indecision
again
;
but
upon
everybody
's
assure
her
that
nothing
could
be
so
easy
,
that
it
be
the
easy
game
on
the
card
,
and
Henry
Crawford
's
stepping
forward
with
a
most
earnest
request
to
be
allow
to
sit
between
her
ladyship
and
Miss
Price
,
and
teach
them
both
<EOS>
,
it
be
so
settle
;
and
Sir
Thomas
,
Mrs.
Norris
,
and
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Grant
be
seat
at
the
table
of
prime
intellectual
state
and
dignity
,
the
remain
six
,
under
Miss
Crawford
's
direction
,
be
arrange
round
the
other
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
fine
arrangement
for
Henry
Crawford
,
who
be
close
to
Fanny
,
and
with
his
hand
full
of
business
,
have
two
person
'
card
to
manage
as
well
as
his
own
;
for
though
it
be
impossible
for
Fanny
not
to
feel
herself
mistress
of
the
rule
of
the
game
in
three
minute
,
he
have
yet
to
inspirit
her
play
,
sharpen
her
avarice
,
and
harden
her
heart
,
which
,
especially
in
any
competition
with
William
,
be
a
work
of
some
difficulty
;
and
as
for
Lady
Bertram
,
he
must
continue
in
charge
of
all
her
fame
and
fortune
through
the
whole
evening
;
and
if
quick
enough
to
keep
her
from
look
at
her
card
when
the
deal
begin
,
must
direct
her
in
whatever
be
to
be
do
with
them
to
the
end
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
in
high
spirit
,
do
everything
with
happy
ease
,
and
preeminent
in
all
the
lively
turn
,
quick
resource
,
and
playful
impudence
that
could
do
honour
to
the
game
;
and
the
round
table
be
altogether
a
very
comfortable
contrast
to
the
steady
sobriety
and
orderly
silence
of
the

plant
up

the
house

east

it
may

do

must
be
your
approach

must
make
a

comfortable

it
to
his

<EOS>
His
scheme
be
to
rent
the

himself
the
follow
winter
,
that
he
may
have
a
home
of
his

in

it
in

it

impossible
for
him

accommodate
where
they

material
inconvenience

but
his
attachment
to
that
neighbourhood
do
not
depend
upon
one
amusement
or
one
season
of
the
year
:
he
have
set
his
heart
upon
have
a
something
there
that
he
could
come
to
at
any
time
,
a
little
homestall
at
his
command
,
where
all
the
holiday
of
his
year
may
be
spend
,
and
he
may
find
himself
continue
,
improve
,
and
_
perfect

that
friendship

intimacy
with
the
Mansfield

family

Fanny

reception

so
calm

an
answer

certainly
,
sir

I
have
no

of
residence

,
Crawford
,
though
I
refuse
you
as

come
to
me
as
a
friend

<EOS>
consider
the
house
as
half
your
own
every
winter

and
we
will
add
to
the
stable
on
your
own
improved
plan

with
all
the
improvement
of
your
improved
plan
that
may
occur
to
you
this
spring

<EOS>

We
shall
be
the
loser

"
continue
Sir
Thomas

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
going
,
though
only
eight
mile
,
will
be
an
unwelcome
contraction
of
our
family
circle
;
but
I
should
have
be
deeply
mortify
if
any
son
of
mine
could
reconcile
himself
to
do
less
.
<EOS>
It
be
perfectly
natural
that
you
should
not
have
think
much
on
the
subject
,
Mr.
Crawford
.
<EOS>
but
a
parish
have
want
and
claim
which
can
be
know
only
by
a
clergyman
constantly
resident
,
and
which
no
proxy
can
be
capable
of
satisfy
to
the
same
extent
.
<EOS>
Edmund
may
,
in
the
common
phrase
,
do
the
duty
of
Thornton
,
that
is
,
he
may
read
prayer
and
preach
,
without
give
up
Mansfield
Park
:
he
may
ride
over
every
Sunday
,
to
a
house
nominally
inhabit
,
and
go
through
divine
service
;
he
may
be
the
clergyman
of
Thornton
Lacey
every
seventh
day
,
for
three
or
four
hour
,
if
that
would
content
him
.
<EOS>
but
it
will
not
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
human
nature
need
more
lesson
than
a
weekly
sermon
can
convey
;
and
that
if
he
do
not
live
among
his
parishioner
,
and
prove
himself
,
by
constant
attention
,
their
well
-
wisher
and
friend
,
he
do
very
little
either
for
their
good
or
his
own

<EOS>
Mr.
Crawford
bow

acquiescence

<EOS>
"
I
repeat
again
,
"
add
Sir
Thomas

"
that
Thornton
Lacey

the
only
house

It

very

true

,
that
you
should
leave
Northamptonshire
without
this
indulgence
.
<EOS>
It
would
give
me
pleasure
to
see
you
both
dance
.
<EOS>
You
speak
of
the
ball
at
Northampton
.
<EOS>
Your
cousin
have
occasionally
attend
them
;
but
they
would
not
altogether
suit
us
now
.
<EOS>
the
fatigue
would
be
too
much
for
your
aunt
.
<EOS>
I
believe
we
must
not
think
of
a
Northampton
ball
.
<EOS>
a
dance
at
home
would
be
more
eligible
;
and
if
 
"
  
"
ah
,
my
dear
Sir
Thomas
!
<EOS>
"
interrupt
Mrs.
Norris
,
"
I
know
what
be
come

<EOS>
I
know
what
you
be
go
to
say

<EOS>
if
dear
Julia
be
at
home
,
or
dear
Mrs.
Rushworth
at
Sotherton
,
to
afford
a
reason
,
an
occasion
for
such
a
thing
,
you
would
be
tempt
to
give
the
young
people
a
dance
at
Mansfield
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
would
.
<EOS>
if
_
they
_
be
at
home
to
grace
the
ball
,
a
ball
you
would
have
this
very
Christmas
.
<EOS>
thank
your
uncle

William
,
thank
your
uncle
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My

Sir
Thomas
,
gravely
interpose
,
"
have
their
pleasure
at
Brighton
,
and
I
hope
be
very
happy
;
but
the
dance
which
I
think
of
give
at
Mansfield
will
be
for
their
cousin
.
<EOS>
Could
we
be
all
assemble
,
our
satisfaction
would
undoubtedly
be
more
complete
,
but
the
absence
of
some
be
not
to
debar
the
other
of
amusement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
have
not
another
word
to
say
.
<EOS>
She
see
decision
in
his
look
,
and
her
surprise
and
vexation
require
some
minute
'
silence
to
be
settle
into
composure
.
<EOS>
a
ball
at
such
a
time
!
<EOS>
His
daughter
absent
and
herself
not
consult
!
<EOS>
there
be
comfort
,
however
,
soon
at
hand
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
must
be
the
doer
of
everything
<EOS>
:
Lady
Bertram
would
of
course
be
spare
all
thought
and
exertion
,
and
it
would
all
fall
upon
_
her
_
.
<EOS>
She
should
have
to
do
the
honour
of
the
evening
;
and
this
reflection
quickly
restore
so
much
of
her
good
-
humour
as
enable
her
to
join
in
with
the
other
,
before
their
happiness
and
thank
be
all
express
.
  
<EOS>
Edmund
,
William
,
and
Fanny
do
,
in
their
different
way
,
look
and
speak
as
much
grateful
pleasure
in
the
promise
ball
as
Sir
Thomas
could
desire
.
<EOS>
Edmund
's
feeling
be
for
the
other
two
.
<EOS>
His
father
have
never
confer
a
favour
or
shew
a
kindness
more
to
his
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Bertram
be
perfectly
quiescent
and
contented
,
and
have
no
objection
to
make
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
engage
for
its
give
her
very
little
trouble
;
and
she
assure
him
"
that
she
be
not
at
all
afraid
of
the
trouble
;
indeed
,
she
could
not
imagine
there
would
be
any
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
be
ready
with
her
suggestion
as
to
the
room
he
would
think
fit
to
be
use
,
but
find
it
all
prearrange
;
and
when
she
would
have
conjecture
and
hint
about
the
day
,
it
appear
that
the
day
be
settle
too
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
have
be
amuse
himself
with
shape
a
very
complete
outline
of
the
business
;
and
as
soon
as
she
would
listen
quietly
,
could
read
his
list
of
the
family
to
be
invite
,
from
whom
he
calculate
,
with
all
necessary
allowance
for
the
shortness
of
the
notice
,
to
collect
young
people
enough
to
form
twelve
or
fourteen
couple
:
and
could
detail
the
consideration
which
have
induce
him
to
fix
on
the
22nd
as
the
most
eligible
day
.
<EOS>
William
be
require
to
be
at
Portsmouth
on
the
24th
;
the
22nd
would
therefore
be
the
last
day
of
his
visit
;
but
where
the
day
be
so
few
it
would
be
unwise
to
fix
on
any
earlier
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
be
oblige
to
be
satisfied
with
think
just
the
same
,
and
with
have
be
on
the
point
of
propose
the
22nd
herself
,
as
by
far
the
good
day
for
the
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
the
ball
be
now
a
settle
thing
,
and
before
the
evening
a
proclaim
thing
to
all
whom
it
concern
.
<EOS>
invitation
be
send
with
despatch
,
and
many
a
young
lady
go
to
bed
that
night
with
her
head
full
of
happy
care
as
well
as
Fanny
.
<EOS>
to
her
the
care
be
sometimes
almost
beyond
the
happiness
;
for
young
and
inexperienced
,
with
small
mean
of
choice
and
no
confidence
in
her
own
taste
,
the
"
how
she
should
be
dress
<EOS>
"
be
a
point
of
painful
solicitude
;
and
the
almost
solitary
ornament
in
her
possession
,
a
very
pretty
amber
cross
which
William
have
bring
her
from
Sicily
,
be
the
great
distress
of
all
,
for
she
have
nothing
but
a
bit
of
ribbon
to
fasten
it
to
;
and
though
she
have
wear
it
in
that
manner
once
,
would
it
be
allowable
at
such
a
time
in
the
midst
of
all
the
rich
ornament
which
she
suppose
all
the
other
young
lady
would
appear
in
?
<EOS>
and
yet
not
to
wear
it
!
<EOS>
William
have
want
to
buy
her
a
gold
chain
too
,
but
the
purchase
have
be
beyond
his
mean
,
and
therefore
not
to
wear
the
cross
may
be
mortify
him
.
<EOS>
these
be
anxious
consideration
;
enough
to
sober
her
spirit
even
under
the
prospect
of
a
ball
give
principally
for
her
gratification
.
  
<EOS>
the
preparation
meanwhile
go
on
,
and
Lady
Bertram
continue
to
sit
on
her
sofa
without
any
inconvenience
from
them
.
<EOS>
She
have
some
extra
visit
from
the
housekeeper
,
and
her
maid
be
rather
hurried
in
make
up
a
new
dress
for
her
<EOS>
:
Sir
Thomas
give
order
,
and
Mrs.
Norris
run
about
;
but
all
this
give
_
<EOS>
her
_
<EOS>
no
trouble
,
and
as
she
have
foresee
,
"
there
be
,
in
fact
,
no
trouble
in
the
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Edmund
be
at
this
time
particularly
full
of
care
:
his
mind
be
deeply
occupy
in
the
consideration
of
two
important
event
now
at
hand
,
which
be
to
fix
his
fate
in
life
 
ordination
and
matrimony
 
event
of
such
a
serious
character
as
to
make
the
ball
,
which
would
be
very
quickly
follow
by
one
of
them
,
appear
of
less
moment
in
his
eye
than
in
those
of
any
other
person
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
on
the
23rd
he
be
go
to
a
friend
near
Peterborough
,
in
the
same
situation
as
himself
,
and
they
be
to
receive
ordination
in
the
course
of
the
Christmas
week
.
<EOS>
half
his
destiny
would
then
be
determine
,
but
the
other
half
may
not
be
so
very
smoothly
woo
.
<EOS>
His
duty
would
be
establish
,
but
the
wife
who
be
to
share
,
and
animate
,
and
reward
those
duty
,
may
yet
be
unattainable
.
<EOS>
He
know
his
own
mind
,
but
he
be
not
always
perfectly
assure
of
know
Miss
Crawford
's
.
<EOS>
there
be
point
on
which
they
do
not
quite
agree
;
there
be
moment
in
which
she
do
not
seem
propitious
;
and
though
trust
altogether
to
her
affection
,
so
far
as
to
be
resolve
 
almost
resolve
 
on
bring
it
to
a
decision
within
a
very
short
time
,
as
soon
as
the
variety
of
business
before
him
be
arrange
,
and
he
know
what
he
have
to
offer
her
,
he
have
many
anxious
feeling
,
many
doubt
hour
as
to
the
result
.
<EOS>
His
conviction
of
her
regard
for
him
be
sometimes
very
strong
;
he
could
look
back
on
a
long
course
of
encouragement
,
and
she
be
as
perfect
in
disintereste
attachment
as
in
everything
else
.
<EOS>
but
at
other
time
doubt
and
alarm
intermingle
with
his
hope
;
and
when
he
think
of
her
acknowledge
disinclination
for
privacy
and
retirement
,
her
decide
preference
of
a
London
life
,
what
could
he
expect
but
a
determined
rejection
?
<EOS>
unless
it
be
an
acceptance
even
more
to
be
deprecate
,
demand
such
sacrifice
of
situation
and
employment
on
his
side
as
conscience
must
forbid
.
  
<EOS>
the
issue
of
all
depend
on
one
question
.
<EOS>
do
she
love
him
well
enough
to
forego
what
have
use
to
be
essential
point
?
<EOS>
do
she
love
him
well
enough
to
make
them
no
longer
essential
?
<EOS>
and
this
question
,
which
he
be
continually
repeat
to
himself
,
though
oftenest
answer
with
a
"
yes
,
"
have
sometimes
its
"
no
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
be
soon
to
leave
Mansfield
,
and
on
this
circumstance
the
"
no
"
and
the
"
yes
"
have
be
very
recently
in
alternation
.
<EOS>
He
have
see
her
eye
sparkle
as
she
speak
of
the
dear
friend
's
letter
,
which
claim
a
long
visit
from
her
in
London
,
and
of
the
kindness
of
Henry
,
in
engage
to
remain
where
he
be
till
January
,
that
he
may
convey
her
thither
;
he
have
hear
her
speak
of
the
pleasure
of
such
a
journey
with
an
animation
which
have
"
no
"
in
every
tone
.
<EOS>
but
this
have
occur
on
the
first
day
of
its
be
settle
,
within
the
first
hour
of
the
burst
of
such
enjoyment
,
when
nothing
but
the
friend
she
be
to
visit
be
before
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
since
hear
her
express
herself
differently
,
with
other
feeling
,
more
chequered
feeling
<EOS>
:
he
have
hear
her
tell
Mrs.
Grant
that
she
should
leave
her
with
regret
;
that
she
begin
to
believe
neither
the
friend
nor
the
pleasure
she
be
go
to
be
worth
those
she
leave
behind
;
and
that
though
she
feel
she
must
go
,
and
know
she
should
enjoy
herself
when
once
away
,
she
be
already
look
forward
to
be
at
Mansfield
again
.
<EOS>
be
there
not
a
"
yes
"
in
all
this
?
  
<EOS>
with
such
matter
to
ponder
over
,
and
arrange
,
and
re
-
arrange
,
Edmund
could
not
,
on
his
own
account
,
think
very
much
of
the
evening
which
the
rest
of
the
family
be
look
forward
to
with
a
more
equal
degree
of
strong
interest
.
<EOS>
independent
of
his
two
cousin
'
enjoyment
in
it
,
the
evening
be
to
him
of
no
high
value
than
any
other
appoint
meeting
of
the
two
family
may
be
.
<EOS>
in
every
meeting
there
be
a
hope
of
receive
farth
confirmation
of
Miss
Crawford
's
attachment
;
but
the
whirl
of
a
ballroom
,
perhaps
,
be
not
particularly
favourable
to
the
excitement
or
expression
of
serious
feeling
.
<EOS>
to
engage
her
early
for
the
two
first
dance
be
all
the
command
of
individual
happiness
which
he
feel
in
his
power
,
and
the
only
preparation
for
the
ball
which
he
could
enter
into
,
in
spite
of
all
that
be
pass
around
him
on
the
subject
,
from
morning
till
night
.
  
<EOS>
Thursday
be
the
day
of
the
ball
;
and
on
Wednesday
morning
Fanny
,
still
unable
to
satisfy
herself
as
to
what
she
ought
to
wear
,
determined
to
seek
the
counsel
of
the
more
enlighten
,
and
apply
to
Mrs.
Grant
and
her
sister
,
whose
acknowledge
taste
would
certainly
bear
her
blameless
;
and
as
Edmund
and
William
be
go
to
Northampton
,
and
she
have
reason
to
think
Mr.
Crawford
likewise
out
,
she
walk
down
to
the
parsonage
without
much
fear
of
want
an
opportunity
for
private
discussion
;
and
the
privacy
of
such
a
discussion
be
a
most
important
part
of
it
to
Fanny
,
be
more
than
half
-
ashamed
of
her
own
solicitude
.
  
<EOS>
She
meet
Miss
Crawford
within
a
few
yard
of
the
Parsonage
,
just
set
out
to
call
on
her
,
and
as
it
seem
to
her
that
her
friend
,
though
oblige
to
insist
on
turn
back
,
be
unwilling
to
lose
her
walk
,
she
explain
her
business
at
once
,
and
observe
,
that
if
she
would
be
so
kind
as
to
give
her
opinion
,
it
may
be
all
talk
over
as
well
without
door
as
within
.
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
appear
gratify
by
the
application
,
and
after
a
moment
's
thought
,
urge
Fanny
's
return
with
her
in
a
much
more
cordial
manner
than
before
,
and
propose
their
go
up
into
her
room
,
where
they
may
have
a
comfortable
coze
,
without
disturb
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Grant
,
who
be
together
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
It
be
just
the
plan
to
suit
Fanny
;
and
with
a
great
deal
of
gratitude
on
her
side
for
such
ready
and
kind
attention
,
they
proceed
indoor
,
and
upstairs
,
and
be
soon
deep
in
the
interesting
subject
.
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
,
please
with
the
appeal
,
give
her
all
her
good
judgment
and
taste
,
make
everything
easy
by
her
suggestion
,
and
try
to
make
everything
agreeable
by
her
encouragement
.
<EOS>
the
dress
be
settle
in
all
its
grander
part
 
<EOS>
"
but
what
shall
you
have
by
way
of
necklace
?
"
say
Miss
Crawford
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
not
you
wear
your
brother
's
cross
?
"
<EOS>
and
as
she
speak
she
be
undo
a
small
parcel
,
which
Fanny
have
observe
in
her
hand
when
they
meet
.
<EOS>
Fanny
acknowledge
her
wish
and
doubt
on
this
point
:
she
do
not
know
how
either
to
wear
the
cross
,
or
to
refrain
from
wear
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
answer
by
have
a
small
trinket
-
box
place
before
her
,
and
be
request
to
chuse
from
among
several
gold
chain
and
necklace
.
<EOS>
such
have
be
the
parcel
with
which
Miss
Crawford
be
provide
,
and
such
the
object
of
her
intend
visit
:
and
in
the
kind
manner
she
now
urge
Fanny
's
take
one
for
the
cross
and
to
keep
for
her
sake
,
say
everything
she
could
think
of
to
obviate
the
scruple
which
be
make
Fanny
start
back
at
first
with
a
look
of
horror
at
the
proposal
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
what
a
collection
I
have
,
"
say
she
;
"
more
by
half
than
I
ever
use
or
think
of
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
offer
them
as
new
.
<EOS>
I
offer
nothing
but
an
old
necklace
.
<EOS>
You
must
forgive
the
liberty
,
and
oblige
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
still
resist
,
and
from
her
heart
.
<EOS>
the
gift
be
too
valuable
.
<EOS>
but
Miss
Crawford
persevere
,
and
argue
the
case
with
so
much
affectionate
earnestness
through
all
the
head
of
William
and
the
cross
,
and
the
ball
,
and
herself
,
as
to
be
finally
successful
.
<EOS>
Fanny
find
herself
oblige
to
yield
,
that
she
may
not
be
accuse
of
pride
or
indifference
,
or
some
other
littleness
;
and
have
with
modest
reluctance
give
her
consent
,
proceed
to
make
the
selection
.
<EOS>
She
look
and
look
,
longing
to
know
which
may
be
least
valuable
;
and
be
determine
in
her
choice
at
last
,
by
fancy
there
be
one
necklace
more
frequently
place
before
her
eye
than
the
rest
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
gold
,
prettily
work
;
and
though
Fanny
would
have
prefer
a
long
and
a
plainer
chain
as
more
adapted
for
her
purpose
,
she
hope
,
in
fix
on
this
,
to
be
chuse
what
Miss
Crawford
least
wish
to
keep
.
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
smile
her
perfect
approbation
;
and
hasten
to
complete
the
gift
by
put
the
necklace
round
her
,
and
make
her
see
how
well
it
look
.
<EOS>
Fanny
have
not
a
word
to
say
against
its
becomingness
,
and
,
except
what
remain
of
her
scruple
,
be
exceedingly
pleased
with
an
acquisition
so
very
apropos
.
<EOS>
She
would
rather
,
perhaps
,
have
be
oblige
to
some
other
person
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
an
unworthy
feeling
.
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
have
anticipate
her
want
with
a
kindness
which
prove
her
a
real
friend
.
<EOS>
"
when
I
wear
this
necklace
I
shall
always
think
of
you

"
say
she

"
and
feel
how
very
kind
you
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
think
of
somebody
else
too
,
when
you
wear
that
necklace
,
"
reply
Miss
Crawford
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
think
of
Henry
,
for
it
be
his
choice
in
the
first
place
.
<EOS>
He
give
it
to
me
,
and
with
the
necklace
I
make
over
to
you
all
the
duty
of
remember
the
original
giver
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
a
family
remembrancer
.
<EOS>
the
sister
be
not
to
be
in
your
mind
without
bring
the
brother
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
,
in
great
astonishment
and
confusion
,
would
have
return
the
present
instantly
.
<EOS>
to
take
what
have
be
the
gift
of
another
person
,
of
a
brother
too
,
impossible
!
<EOS>
it
must
not
be
!
<EOS>
and
with
an
eagerness
and
embarrassment
quite
divert
to
her
companion
,
she
lay
down
the
necklace
again
on
its
cotton
,
and
seem
resolve
either
to
take
another
or
none
at
all
.
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
think
she
have
never
see
a
pretty
consciousness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
child
,
"
say
she
,
laugh
,
"
what
be
you
afraid
of
?
<EOS>
do
you
think
Henry
will
claim
the
necklace
as
mine
,
and
fancy
you
do
not
come
honestly
by
it
?
<EOS>
or
be
you
imagine
he
would
be
too
much
flatter
by
see
round
your
lovely
throat
an
ornament
which
his
money
purchase
three
year
ago
,
before
he
know
there
be
such
a
throat
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
or
perhaps
"
 
look
archly
 
"
you
suspect
a
confederacy
between
us
,
and
that
what
I
be
now
do
be
with
his
knowledge
and
at
his
desire
?
"
  
<EOS>
with
the
deep
blush
Fanny
protest
against
such
a
thought
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
"
reply
Miss
Crawford
more
seriously
,
but
without
at
all
believe
her
,
"
to
convince
me
that
you
suspect
no
trick
,
and
be
as
unsuspicious
of
compliment
as
I
have
always
find
you
,
take
the
necklace
and
say
no
more
about
it
.
<EOS>
Its
be
a
gift
of
my
brother
's
need
not
make
the
small
difference
in
your
accept
it
,
as
I
assure
you
it
make
none
in
my
willingness
to
part
with
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
always
give
me
something
or
other
.
<EOS>
I
have
such
innumerable
present
from
him
that
it
be
quite
impossible
for
me
to
value
or
for
him
to
remember
half
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
this
necklace
,
I
do
not
suppose
I
have
wear
it
six
time
:
it
be
very
pretty
,
but
I
never
think
of
it
;
and
though
you
would
be
most
heartily
welcome
to
any
other
in
my
trinket
-
box
,
you
have
happen
to
fix
on
the
very
one
which
,
if
I
have
a
choice
,
I
would
rather
part
with
and
see
in
your
possession
than
any
other
.
<EOS>
say
no
more
against
it
,
I
entreat
you
.
<EOS>
such
a
trifle
be
not
worth
half
so
many
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
dare
not
make
any
farth
opposition
;
and
with
renew
but
less
happy
thank
accept
the
necklace
again
,
for
there
be
an
expression
in
Miss
Crawford
's
eye
which
she
could
not
be
satisfied
with
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
her
to
be
insensible
of
Mr.
Crawford
's
change
of
manner
.
<EOS>
She
have
long
see
it
.
<EOS>
He
evidently
try
to
please
her
:
he
be
gallant
,
he
be
attentive
,
he
be
something
like
what
he
have
be
to
her
cousin
:
he
want
,
she
suppose
,
to
cheat
her
of
her
tranquillity
as
he
have
cheat
them
;
and
whether
he
may
not
have
some
concern
in
this
necklace
 
<EOS>
she
could
not
be
convince
that
he
have
not
,
for
Miss
Crawford
,
complaisant
as
a
sister
,
be
careless
as
a
woman
and
a
friend
.
  
<EOS>
reflect
and
doubt
,
and
feel
that
the
possession
of
what
she
have
so
much
wish
for
do
not
bring
much
satisfaction
,
she
now
walk
home
again
,
with
a
change
rather
than
a
diminution
of
care
since
her
tread
that
path
before
.
    
<EOS>
on
reach
home
Fanny
go
immediately
upstairs
to
deposit
this
unexpected
acquisition
,
this
doubtful
good
of
a
necklace
,
in
some
favourite
box
in
the
East
room
,
which
hold
all
her
small
treasure
;
but
on
open
the
door
,
what
be
her
surprise
to
find
her
cousin
Edmund
there
write
at
the
table
!
<EOS>
such
a
sight
have
never
occur
before
,
be
almost
as
wonderful
as
it
be
welcome
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fanny
,
"
say
he
directly
,
leave
his
seat
and
his
pen
,
and
meet
her
with
something
in
his
hand
,
"
I
beg
your
pardon
for
be
here
.
<EOS>
I
come
to
look
for
you
,
and
after
wait
a
little
while
in
hope
of
your
come
in
,
be
make
use
of
your
inkstand
to
explain
my
errand
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
the
beginning
of
a
note
to
yourself
;
but
I
can
now
speak
my
business
,
which
be
merely
to
beg
your
acceptance
of
this
little
trifle
 
a
chain
for
William
's
cross
.
<EOS>
You
ought
to
have
have
it
a
week
ago
,
but
there
have
be
a
delay
from
my
brother
be
not
be
in
town
by
several
day
so
soon
as
I
expect
;
and
I
have
only
just
now
receive
it
at
Northampton
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
like
the
chain
itself
,
Fanny
.
<EOS>
I
endeavour
to
consult
the
simplicity
of
your
taste
;
but
,
at
any
rate
,
I
know
you
will
be
kind
to
my
intention
,
and
consider
it
,
as
it
really
be
,
a
token
of
the
love
of
one
of
your
old
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
say
,
he
be
hurry
away
,
before
Fanny
,
overpower
by
a
thousand
feeling
of
pain
and
pleasure
,
could
attempt
to
speak
;
but
quicken
by
one
sovereign
wish
<EOS>
,
she
then
call
out
,
"
<EOS>
oh
!
cousin
,
stop
a
moment
,
pray
stop
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
turn
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
attempt
to
thank
you
,
"
she
continue
,
in
a
very
agitated
manner
;
"
thank
be
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
I
feel
much
more
than
I
can
possibly
express
.
<EOS>
Your
goodness
in
thinking
of
me
in
such
a
way
be
beyond
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
that
be
all
you
have
to
say
,
Fanny
"
smile
and
turn
away
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
it
be
not
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
consult
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
almost
unconsciously
she
have
now
undo
the
parcel
he
have
just
put
into
her
hand
,
and
see
before
her
,
in
all
the
niceness
of
jeweller
'
packing
,
a
plain
gold
chain
,
perfectly
simple
and
neat
,
she
could
not
help
burst
forth
again
,
"
oh
,
this
be
beautiful
indeed
!
<EOS>
this
be
the
very
thing
,
precisely
what
I
wish
for
!
<EOS>
this
be
the
only
ornament
I
have
ever
have
a
desire
to
possess
.
<EOS>
It
will
exactly
suit
my
cross
.
<EOS>
They
must
and
shall
be
wear
together
.
<EOS>
It
come
,
too
,
in
such
an
acceptable
moment
.
<EOS>
oh
,
cousin
,
you
do
not
know
how
acceptable
it
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Fanny
,
you
feel
these
thing
a
great
deal
too
much
.
<EOS>
I
be
most
happy
that
you
like
the
chain
,
and
that
it
should
be
here
in
time
for
to
-
morrow
;
but
your
thank
be
far
beyond
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
believe
me
,
I
have
no
pleasure
in
the
world
superior
to
that
of
contribute
to
yours
.
<EOS>
no
,
I
can
safely
say
,
I
have
no
pleasure
so
complete
,
so
unalloyed
.
<EOS>
It
be
without
a
drawback
.
"
  
<EOS>
upon
such
expression
of
affection
Fanny
could
have
live
an
hour
without
say
another
word
;
but
Edmund
,
after
wait
a
moment
,
oblige
her
to
bring
down
her
mind
from
its
heavenly
flight
by
say
,
"
but
what
be
it
that
you
want
to
consult
me
about
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
about
the
necklace
,
which
she
be
now
most
earnestly
long
to
return
,
and
hope
to
obtain
his
approbation
of
her
doing
.
<EOS>
She
give
the
history
of
her
recent
visit
,
and
now
her
rapture
may
well
be
over
;
for
Edmund
be
so
strike
with
the
circumstance
,
so
delighted
with
what
Miss
Crawford
have
do
,
so
gratify
by
such
a
coincidence
of
conduct
between
them
,
that
Fanny
could
not
but
admit
the
superior
power
of
one
pleasure
over
his
own
mind
,
though
it
may
have
its
drawback
.
<EOS>
It
be
some
time
before
she
could
get
his
attention
to
her
plan
,
or
any
answer
to
her
demand
of
his
opinion
:
he
be
in
a
reverie
of
fond
reflection
,
utter
only
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
few
half
-
sentence
of
praise
;
<EOS>
but
when
he
do
awake
and
understand
,
he
be
very
decide
in
oppose
what
she
wish
.
  
<EOS>
"
return
the
necklace
!
<EOS>
no
,
my
dear
Fanny
,
upon
no
account
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
mortify
her
severely
.
<EOS>
there
can
hardly
be
a
more
unpleasant
sensation
than
the
have
anything
return
on
our
hand
which
we
have
give
with
a
reasonable
hope
of
its
contributing
to
the
comfort
of
a
friend
.
<EOS>
why
should
she
lose
a
pleasure
which
she
have
shew
herself
so
deserve
of
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
it
have
be
give
to
me
in
the
first
instance

"
say
Fanny
,
"
I
should
not
have
think
of
return
it
;
but
be
her
brother
's
present

not
it
fair
to
suppose
that
she
would
rather

with
it

it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
must
not
suppose
it
not
want
,
not
acceptable
,
at
least
:
and
its
have
be
originally
her
brother
's
gift
make
no
difference
;
for
as
she
be
not
prevent
from
offer
,
nor
you
from
take
it
on
that
account
,
it
ought
not
to
prevent
you
from
keep
it
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
it
be
handsome
than
mine
,
and
fitter
for
a
ballroom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
it
be
not
handsome
,
not
at
all
handsomer
in
its
way
,
and
,
for
my
purpose
,
not
half
so
fit
.
<EOS>
the
chain
will
agree
with
William
's
cross
beyond
all
comparison
well
than
the
necklace
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
for
one
night
,
Fanny
,
for
only
one
night
,
if
it
_
be
_
a
sacrifice
;
I
be
sure
you
will
,
upon
consideration
,
make
that
sacrifice
rather
than
give
pain
to
one
who
have
be
so
studious
of
your
comfort
.
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
's
attention
to
you
have
be
 
not
more
than
you
be
justly
entitle
to
 
<EOS>
I
be
the
last
person
to

could
_

they

be
invariable
;

to

them
with
what
must
have

the

of
ingratitude

though
I
know
it
could
never
have
the

not
in

I
be
sure

<EOS>
wear

you

engage

do

to

morrow
evening

let
the
chain

which
be
not
order
with
any
reference

the
ball

keep
for
commoner
occasion

<EOS>
this
be
my
advice

<EOS>
I
would
not
have
the
shadow
of
a
coolness
between
the
two
whose
intimacy
I
have
be
observe
with
the
great
pleasure
,
and
in
whose
character
there
be
so
much
general
resemblance
in
true
generosity
and
natural
delicacy
as
to
make
the
few
slight
difference
,
result
principally
from
situation
,
no
reasonable
hindrance
to
a
perfect
friendship
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
the
shadow
of
a
coolness
arise
,
"
he
repeat
,
his
voice
sink
a
little
,
"
between
the
two
dear
object
I
have
on
earth
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
go
as
he
speak
;
and
Fanny
remain
to
tranquillise
herself
as
she
could
.
<EOS>
She
be
one
of
his
two
dear
 
that
must
support
her
.
<EOS>
but
the
other
:
the
first
!
<EOS>
She
have
never
hear
him
speak
so
openly
before
,
and
though
it
tell
her
no
more
than
what
she
have
long
perceive
,
it
be
a
stab
,
for
it
tell
of
his
own
conviction
and
view
.
<EOS>
They
be
decide
.
<EOS>
He
would
marry
Miss
Crawford
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
stab
,
in
spite
of
every
long
-
stand
expectation
;
and
she
be
oblige
to
repeat
again
and
again
,
that
she
be
one
of
his
two
dear
,
before
the
word
give
her
any
sensation

<EOS>
Could
she
believe
Miss
Crawford
to
deserve
him
,
it
would
be
 
<EOS>
oh
,
how
different
would
it
be
 
how
far
more
tolerable
!
<EOS>
but
he
be
deceive
in
her
:
he
give
her
merit
which
she
have
not
;
her
fault
be
what
they
have
ever
be
,
but
he
see
them
no
longer

<EOS>
till
she
have
shed
many
tear
over
this
deception
,
Fanny
could
not
subdue
her
agitation
;
and
the
dejection
which
follow
could
only
be
relieve
by
the
influence
of
fervent
prayer
for
his
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
her
intention
,
as
she
feel
it
to
be
her
duty
,
to
try
to
overcome
all
that
be
excessive
,
all
that
border
on
selfishness

in
her
affection
for
Edmund

<EOS>
to
call
or
to
fancy
it
a
loss
,
a
disappointment
,
would
be
a
presumption
for
which
she
have
not
word
strong
enough
to
satisfy
her
own
humility
.
<EOS>
to
think
of
him
as
Miss
Crawford
may
be
justify
in
thinking
,
would
in
her
be
insanity
.
<EOS>
to
her
he
could
be
nothing
under
any
circumstance
;
nothing
dearer
than
a
friend
.
<EOS>
why
do
such
an
idea
occur
to
her
even
enough
to
be
reprobate
and
forbid
?
<EOS>
It
ought
not
to
have
touch
on
the
confine
of
her
imagination
.
<EOS>
She
would
endeavour
to
be
rational
,
and
to
deserve
the
right
of
judging
of
Miss
Crawford
's
character
,
and
the
privilege
of
true
solicitude
for
him
by
a
sound
intellect
and
an
honest
heart
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
all
the
heroism
of
principle
,
and
be
determined
to
do
her
duty
;
but
have
also
many
of
the
feeling
of
youth
and
nature
,
let
her
not
be
much
wonder
at
,
if
,
after
make
all
these
good
resolution
on
the
side
of
self
-
government
,
she
seize
the
scrap
of
paper
on
which
Edmund
have
begin
write
to
her
,
as
a
treasure
beyond
all
her
hope
,
and
read
with
the
tender
emotion
these
word
,
"
My
very
dear
Fanny
,
you
must
do
me
the
favour
to
accept
"
lock
it
up
with
the
chain
,
as
the
dear
part
of
the
gift
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
only
thing
approach
to
a
letter
which
she
have
ever
receive
from
him
;
she
may
never
receive
another
;
it
be
impossible
that
she
ever
should
receive
another
so
perfectly
gratify
in
the
occasion
and
the
style
.
<EOS>
two
line
more
prize
have
never
fall
from
the
pen
of
the
most
distinguished
author
 
never
more
completely
bless
the
research
of
the
fond
biographer
.
<EOS>
the
enthusiasm
of
a
woman
's
love
be
even
beyond
the
biographer
's
.
<EOS>
to
her
,
the
handwriting
itself
,
independent
of
anything
it
may
convey
,
be
a
blessedness
.
<EOS>
never
be
such
character
cut
by
any
other
human
being
as
Edmund
's
commonest
handwriting
give
!
<EOS>
this
speciman
,
write
in
haste
as
it
be
,
have
not
a
fault
;
and
there
be
a
felicity
in
the
flow
of
the
first
four
word
,
in
the
arrangement
of
"
My
very
dear
Fanny
,
"
which
she
could
have
look
at
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
have
regulate
her
thought
and
comfort
her
feeling
by
this
happy
mixture
of
reason
and
weakness
,
she
be
able
in
due
time
to
go
down
and
resume
her
usual
employment
near
her
aunt
Bertram
,
and
pay
her
the
usual
observance
without
any
apparent
want

<EOS>
Thursday
,
predestine
to
hope
and
enjoyment
,
come
;
and
open
with
more
kindness
to
Fanny
than
such
self
-
willed
,
unmanageable
day
often
volunteer
,
for
soon
after
breakfast
a
very
friendly
note
be
bring
from
Mr.
Crawford
to
William
,
state
that
as
he
find
himself
oblige
to
go
to
London
on
the
morrow
for
a
few
day
,
he
could
not
help
try
to
procure
a
companion
;
and
therefore
hope
that
if
William
could
make
up
his
mind
to
leave
Mansfield
half
a
day
earlier
than
have
be
propose
,
he
would
accept
a
place
in
his
carriage
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Crawford
mean
to
be
in
town
by
his
uncle
's
accustomary
late
dinner
-
hour
,
and
William
be
invite
to
dine
with
him
at
the
Admiral
's
.
<EOS>
the
proposal
be
a
very
pleasant
one
to
William
himself
,
who
enjoy
the
idea
of
travel
post
with
four
horse
,
and
such
a
good
-
humoured
,
agreeable
friend
;
and
,
in
liken
it
to
go
up
with
despatch
,
be
say
at
once
everything
in
favour
of
its
happiness
and
dignity
which
his
imagination
could
suggest
;
and
Fanny
,
from
a
different
motive
,
be
exceedingly
pleased
;
for
the
original
plan
be
that
William
should
go
up
by
the
mail
from
Northampton
the
following
night
,
which
would
not
have
allow
him
an
hour
's
rest
before
he
must
have
get
into
a
Portsmouth
coach
;
and
though
this
offer
of
Mr.
Crawford
's
would
rob
her
of
many
hour
of
his
company
,
she
be
too
happy
in
have
William
spare
from
the
fatigue
of
such
a
journey
,
to
think
of
anything
else
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
approve
of
it
for
another
reason
.
<EOS>
His
nephew
's
introduction
to
Admiral
Crawford
may
be
of
service
.
<EOS>
the
Admiral
,
he
believe
,
have
interest

<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
it
be
a
very
joyous
note
.
<EOS>
Fanny

live
on
it
half
the
morning
,
derive
some
accession
of
pleasure
from
its
writer
be
himself
to
go
away
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
the
ball
,
so
near
at
hand
,
she
have
too
many
agitation
and
fear
to
have
half
the
enjoyment
in
anticipation
which
she
ought
to
have
have
,
or
must
have
be
suppose
to
have
by
the
many
young
lady
look
forward
to
the
same
event
in
situation
more
at
ease
,
but
under
circumstance
of
less
novelty
,
less
interest
,
less
peculiar
gratification
,
than
would
be
attribute
to
her
.
<EOS>
Miss
Price
,
know
only
by
name

half
the
people
invite

be
now
to
make
her
first
appearance
,
and
must
be
regard
as
the
queen
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
who
could
be
happy
than
Miss
Price
?
<EOS>
but
Miss
Price
have
not
be
bring
up
to
the
trade
of

<EOS>
_
out
<EOS>

and
have
she
know
in
what
light
<EOS>
this
ball
be
,
in
general
,
consider
respect
her
<EOS>
,
it
would
very
much
have
lessen
her
comfort
by
increase
the
fear
she
already
have
of
do
wrong
and
be
look
at
.
<EOS>
to
dance
without
much
observation
or
any
extraordinary
fatigue
,
to
have
strength
and
partner
for
about
half
the
evening
,
to
dance
a
little
with
Edmund
,
and
not
a
great
deal
with
Mr.
Crawford
,
to
see
William
enjoy
himself
,
and
be
able
to
keep
away
from
her
aunt
Norris
,
be
the
height
of
her
ambition
,
and
seem
to
comprehend
her
great
possibility
of
happiness
.
<EOS>
as
these
be
the
good
of
her
hope
,
they
could
not
always
prevail
;
and
in
the
course
of
a
long
morning
,
spend
principally
with
her
two
aunt
,
she
be
often
under
the
influence
of
much
less
sanguine
view

<EOS>
William
,
determine
to
make
this
last
day
a
day
of
thorough
enjoyment
,
be
out
snipe
-
shooting
;
Edmund
,
she
have
too
much
reason
to
suppose
,
be
at
the
Parsonage
;
and
leave
alone
to
bear
the
worrying
of
Mrs.
Norris
,
who
be
cross
because
the
housekeeper
would
have
her
own
way
with
the
supper
,
and
whom
_
<EOS>
she
_
could
not
avoid
though
the
housekeeper
may
<EOS>
,
Fanny
be
wear
down
at
last
to
think
everything
an
evil
belong
to
the
ball
,
and
when
send
off
with
a
part
worry
to
dress
,
move
as
languidly
towards
her
own
room
,
and
feel
as
incapable
of
happiness
as
if
she
have
be
allow
no
share
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
as
she
walk
slowly
upstairs
<EOS>
she
think
of
yesterday
;
it
have
be
about
the
same
hour
that
she
have
return
from
the
Parsonage
,
and
find
Edmund
in
the
East
room
.
<EOS>
"
suppose
I
be
to
find
him
there
again
to
-
day
!
"
say
she
to
herself
,
in
a
fond
indulgence
of
fancy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fanny
,
"
say
a
voice
at
that
moment
near
her
.
<EOS>
start
and
look
up
,
she
see
,
across
the
lobby
she
have
just
reach
,
Edmund
himself
,
stand
at
the
head
of
a
different
staircase
.
<EOS>
He
come
towards
her
.
<EOS>
"
You
look
tired
and
fag
,
Fanny
.
<EOS>
You
have
be
walk
too
far
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
have
not
be
out
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
have
have
fatigue
within
door
,
which
be
bad
.
<EOS>
You
have
better
have
go
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
,
not
like
to
complain
,
find
it
easy
to
make
no
answer
;
and
though
he
look
at
her
with
his
usual
kindness
,
she
believe
he
have
soon
cease
to
think
of
her
countenance
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
appear
in
spirit
:
something
unconnected
with
her
be
probably
amiss
.
<EOS>
They
proceed
upstairs
together
,
their
room
be
on
the
same
floor
above
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
come
from
Dr.
Grant
's
,
"
say
Edmund
presently
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
guess
my
errand
there
,
Fanny
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
look
so
conscious
,
that
Fanny
could
think
but
of
one
errand
,
which
turn
her
too
sick
for
speech
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
engage
Miss
Crawford
for
the
two
first
dance
,
"
be
the
explanation
that
follow
,
and
bring
Fanny
to
life
again
,
enable
her
,
as
she
find
she
be
expect
to
speak
,
to
utter
something
like
an
inquiry
as
to
the
result
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
he
answer
,
"
she
be
engage
to
me
;
but
"
(
with
a
smile
that
do
not
sit
easy
)
"
she
say
it
be
to
be
the
last
time
that
she
ever
will
dance
with
me
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
serious
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
I
hope
,
I
be
sure
she
be
not
serious
;
but
I
would
rather
not
hear
it
.
<EOS>
She
never
have
dance
with
a
clergyman
,
she
say
,
and
she
never
_
will
_
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
sake
,
I
could
wish
there
have
be
no
ball
just
at
 
I
mean
not
this
very
week
,
this
very
day
;
to
-
morrow
I
leave
home
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
struggle
for
speech
,
and
say
,
"
I
be
very
sorry
that
anything
have
occur
to
distress
you
.
<EOS>
this
ought
to
be
a
day
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
mean
it
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
,
yes
!
<EOS>
and
it
will
be
a
day
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
It
will
all
end
right
.
<EOS>
I
be
only
vexed
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
it
be
not
that
I
consider
the
ball
as
ill
-
time
;
what
do
it
signify
?
<EOS>
but
,
Fanny
,
"
stop
her
,
by
take
her
hand
,
and
speak
low
and
seriously
,
"
you
know
what
all
this
mean
.
<EOS>
You
see
how
it
be
;
and
could
tell
me
,
perhaps
well
than
I
could
tell
you
,
how
and
why
I
be
vexed
.
<EOS>
let
me
talk
to
you
a
little
.
<EOS>
You
be
a
kind
,
kind
listener
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
pain
by
her
manner
this
morning
,
and
can
not
get
the
well
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
her
disposition
to
be
as
sweet
and
faultless
as
your
own
,
but
the
influence
of
her
former
companion
make
her
seem
 
give
to
her
conversation
,
to
her
professed
opinion
,
sometimes
a
tinge
of
wrong
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
_
think
_
evil
,
but
she
speak
it
,
speak
it
in
playfulness
;
and
though
I
know
it
to
be
playfulness
,
it
grieve
me
to
the
soul
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
effect
of
education
,
"
say
Fanny
gently
.
  
<EOS>
Edmund
could
not
but
agree
to
it
.
"
<EOS>
yes
,
that
uncle
and
aunt
!
<EOS>
They
have
injure
the
fine
mind
;
for
sometimes
,
Fanny
,
I
own
to
you
,
it
do
appear
more
than
manner
:
it
appear
as
if
the
mind
itself
be
taint
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
imagine
this
to
be
an
appeal
to
her
judgment
,
and
therefore
,
after
a
moment
's
consideration
,
say
,
"
if
you
only
want
me
as
a
listener
,
cousin
,
I
will
be
as
useful
as
I
can
;
but
I
be
not
qualified
for
an
adviser
.
<EOS>
do
not
ask
advice
of
_
me
_
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
competent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
right
,
Fanny
,
to
protest
against
such
an
office
,
but
you
need
not
be
afraid
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
subject
on
which
I
should
never
ask
advice
;
it
be
the
sort
of
subject
on
which
it
have
well
never
be
ask
;
and
few
,
I
imagine
,
do
ask
it
,
but
when
they
want
to
be
influence
against
their
conscience
.
<EOS>
I
only
want
to
talk
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
one
thing
more
.
<EOS>
excuse
the
liberty
;
but
take
care
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
how
_
you
talk
to
me
.
<EOS>
do
not
tell
me
anything
now
,
which
hereafter
you
may
be
sorry
for
.
<EOS>
the
time
may
come
 
"
  
<EOS>
the
colour
rush
into
her
cheek
as
she
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dearest
Fanny
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Edmund
,
press
her
hand
to
his
lip
with
almost
as
much
warmth
as
if
it
have
be
Miss
Crawford
's
,
<EOS>
"
you
be
all
considerate
think
!
<EOS>
but
it
be
unnecessary
here
.
<EOS>
the
time
will
never
come
.
<EOS>
no
such
time
as
you
allude
to
will
ever
come
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
it
most
improbable
:
the
chance
grow
less
and
less
;
and
even
if
it
should
,
there
will
be
nothing
to
be
remember
by
either
you
or
me
that
we
need
be
afraid
of
,
for
I
can
never
be
ashamed
of
my
own
scruple
;
and
if
they
be
remove
,
it
must
be
by
change
that
will
only
raise
her
character
the
more
by
the
recollection
of
the
fault
she
once
have
.
<EOS>
You
be
the
only
be
upon
earth
to
whom
I
should
say
what
I
have
say
;
but
you
have
always
know
my
opinion
of
her
;
you
can
bear
me
witness
,
Fanny
,
that
I
have
never
be
blind
.
<EOS>
how
many
a
time
have
we
talk
over
her
little
error
!
<EOS>
You
need
not
fear
me
;
I
have
almost
give
up
every
serious
idea
of
her
;
but
I
must
be
a
blockhead
indeed
,
if
,
whatever
befall
me
,
I
could
think
of
your
kindness
and
sympathy
without
the
sincerest
gratitude
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
say
enough
to
shake
the
experience
of
eighteen
.
<EOS>
He
have
say
enough
to
give
Fanny
some
happy
feeling
than
she
have
lately
know
,
and
with
a
bright
look
,
she
answer
,
"
yes
,
cousin
,
I
be
convince
that

you

would
be
incapable

anything
else

some
may

be
now
on
the
second
floor

and
the
appearance
of
a
housemaid
prevent
any
farther
conversation

<EOS>
for
Fanny
's
present
comfort
it
be
conclude
,
perhaps
,
at
the
happy
moment
:
have
he
be
able
to
talk
another
five
minute
,
there
be
no
saying
that
he
may
not
have
talk
away
all
Miss
Crawford
's
fault
and
his
own
despondence
.
<EOS>
but
as
it
be
,
they
part
with
look
on
his
side
of
grateful
affection
,
and
with
some
very
precious
sensation
on
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
feel
nothing
like
it
for
hour
.
<EOS>
since
the
first
joy
from
Mr.
Crawford
's
note
to
William

away
,
she
have
be
in
a
state
absolutely
the
reverse
;
there
have
be
no
comfort
around
,
<EOS>
no
hope
within
her

<EOS>
now
everything

good
fortune

upon
her
mind

and
seem
of
great
value
than
at
first

<EOS>
the
ball
,
too
 
such
an
evening
of
pleasure
before

<EOS>
It
be
now
a
real
animation
;
and
she
begin
to
dress
for
it
with
much
of
the
happy
flutter
which
belong
to
a
ball
.
<EOS>
all
go
well
<EOS>
:
she
do
not
dislike
her
own
look
;
and
when
she
come
to
the
necklace
again
,
her
good
fortune
seem
complete
,
for
upon
trial
the
one
give
her
by
Miss
Crawford
<EOS>
would
by
no
means
go
through
the
ring
of
the
cross
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
to
oblige
Edmund
,
resolve
to
wear
it
;
but
it
be
too
large
for
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
His
,
therefore
,
must
be
wear
;
and
have
,
with
delightful
feeling
,
join
the
chain
and
the
cross
 
those
memorial
of
the
two
most
beloved
of
her
heart
,
those
dear
token
so
form
for
each
other
by
everything
real
and
imaginary
 
and
put
them
round
her
neck
,
and
see
and
feel
how
full
of
William
and
Edmund
they
be
,
she
be
able
,
without
an
effort
,
to
resolve
on
wear
Miss
Crawford
's
necklace
too
.
<EOS>
She
acknowledge
it
to
be
right
.
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
have
a
claim
;
and
when
it
be
no
longer
to
encroach
on
,
to
interfere
with
the
strong
claim
,
the
truer
kindness
of
another
,
she
could
do
her
justice
even
with
pleasure
to
herself
.
<EOS>
the
necklace
really
look
very
well
;
and
Fanny
leave
her
room
at
last
,
comfortably
satisfied
with
herself
and
all
about
her
.
  
<EOS>
Her
aunt

on
this
occasion
with
an
unusual
degree
of
wakefulness

<EOS>
It

and
when

,
of
course

of
any
use

but
Fanny

<EOS>
Her

<EOS>
the
neatness
and
propriety
of
her

be
all
that

with
all
the
benefit
of
her

what
extraordinary
advantage

the
mean

<EOS>
the

be
take
notice
of

your
own
generous
present
to
her
when
dear
Mrs.

<EOS>
what
would
she
have
be
if
we
have
not
take
her
by
the
hand
?
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas

but
when
they
sit
down
to
table
the
eye
of
the
two
young

assure
him
that
the
subject
may
be
gently
touch
again

with
more
success

<EOS>
Fanny
see
that
she
be
approve

and
the
consciousness
of
look
well
make
her
look
still
well
.
<EOS>
from
a
variety
of
cause
she
be
happy
,
and
she
be
soon
make
still
happy
;
for
in
follow
her
aunt
out
of
the
room
,
Edmund
,
who
be

the
door
,
say
,
as
she

,
"
You
must
dance

me
,
Fanny
;
you
must
keep
two
dance

me
;
any
two
that

,
except
the
first
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
have
nothing
more
to
wish
for
.
<EOS>
She
have
hardly
ever
be
in
a
state
so
nearly
approach
high
spirit
in
her
life
.
<EOS>
Her
cousin
'
former
gaiety
on
the
day
of
a
ball
be
no
longer
surprising
to
her
;
she
feel
it
to
be
indeed
very
charming
,
and
be
actually
practise
her
step
about
the
drawing
-
room
as
long
as
she
could
be
safe
from
the
notice
of
her
aunt
Norris
,
who
be
entirely
take
up
at
first
in
fresh
arranging
and
injure
the
noble
fire
which
the
butler
have
prepare
.
  
<EOS>
half
an
hour
follow
that
would
have
be
at
least
languid
under
any
other
circumstance
,
but
Fanny
's
happiness
still
prevail
.
<EOS>
It
be
but
to
think
of
her
conversation
with
Edmund
,
and
what
be
the
restlessness
of
Mrs.
Norris
?
<EOS>
what
be
the
yawn
of
Lady
Bertram
?
  
<EOS>
the
gentleman
join
them
;
and
soon
after
begin
the
sweet
expectation
of
a
carriage
,
when
a
general
spirit
of
ease
and
enjoyment
seem
diffused
,
and
they
all
stand
about
and
talk
and
laugh
,
and
every
moment
have
its
pleasure
and
its
hope
.
<EOS>
Fanny
feel
that
there
must
be
a
struggle
in
Edmund
's
cheerfulness
,
but
it
be
delightful
to
see
the
effort
so
successfully
make
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
carriage
be
really
hear
,
when
the
guest
begin
really
to
assemble
,
her
own
gaiety
of
heart
be
much
subdue
:
the
sight
of
so
many
stranger
throw
her
back
into
herself
;
and
besides
the
gravity
and
formality
of
the
first
great
circle
,
which
the
manner
of
neither
Sir
Thomas
nor
Lady
Bertram
be
of
a
kind
to
do
away
,
she
find
herself
occasionally
call
on
to
endure
something
bad
.
<EOS>
She
be
introduce
here
and
there
by
her
uncle
,
and
force
to
be
speak
to
,
and
to
curtsey
,
and
speak
again
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
hard
duty
,
and
she
be
never
summon
to
it
without
look
at
William
,
as
he
walk
about
at
his
ease
in
the
background
of
the
scene
,
and
longing
to
be
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
entrance
of
the
Grants
and
Crawfords
be
a
favourable
epoch
.
<EOS>
the
stiffness
of
the
meeting
soon
give
way
before
their
popular
manner
and
more
diffused
intimacy
:
little
group
be
form
,
and
everybody
grow
comfortable
.
<EOS>
Fanny
feel
the
advantage
;
and
,
draw
back
from
the
toil
of
civility
,
would
have
be
again
most
happy
,
could
she
have
keep
her
eye
from
wander
between
Edmund
and
Mary
Crawford
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
look
all
loveliness
 
and
what
may
not
be
the
end
of
it
?
<EOS>
Her
own
musing
be
bring
to
an
end
on
perceive
Mr.
Crawford
before
her
,
and
her
thought
be
put
into
another
channel
by
his
engage
her
almost
instantly
for
the
first
two
dance
.
<EOS>
Her
happiness
on
this
occasion
be
very
much
_
<EOS>
a
_
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
la
<EOS>
_
_
mortal
_
,
finely
chequer
.
<EOS>
to
be
secure
of
a
partner
at
first
be
a
most
essential
good
 
for
the
moment
of
beginning
be
now
grow
seriously
near
;
and
she
so
little
understand
her
own
claim
as
to
think
that
if
Mr.
Crawford
have
not
ask
her
,
she
must
have
be
the
last
to
be
seek
after
,
and
should
have
receive
a
partner
only
through
a
series
of
inquiry
,
and
bustle
,
and
interference
,
which
would
have
be
terrible
;
but
at
the
same
time
there
be
a
pointedness
in
his
manner
of
ask
her
which
she
do
not
like
,
and
she
see
his
eye
glance
for
a
moment
at
her
necklace
,
with
a
smile
 
<EOS>
she
think
there
be
a
smile
 
which
make
her
blush
and
feel
wretched
.
<EOS>
and
though
there
be
no
second
glance
to
disturb
her
,
though
his
object
seem
then
to
be
only
quietly
agreeable
,
she
could
not
get
the
well
of
her
embarrassment
,
heighten
as
it
be
by
the
idea
of
his
perceive
it
,
and
have
no
composure
till
he
turn
away
to
some
one
else
.
<EOS>
then
she
could
gradually
rise
up
to
the
genuine
satisfaction
of
have
a
partner
,
a
voluntary
partner
,
secure
against
the
dancing
begin
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
company
be
move
into
the
ballroom
,
she
find
herself
for
the
first
time
near
Miss
Crawford
,
whose
eye
and
smile
be
immediately
and
more
unequivocally
direct
as
her
brother
's
have
be
,
and
who
be
begin
to
speak
on
the
subject
,
when
Fanny
,
anxious
to
get
the
story
over
,
hasten
to
give
the
explanation
of
the
second
necklace
:
the
real
chain
.
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
listen
;
and
all
her
intended
compliment
and
insinuation
to
Fanny
be
forget
:
<EOS>
she
feel
only
one
thing
;
and
her
eye
,
bright
as
they
have
be
before
,
shew
they
could
yet
be
bright
,
she
exclaim
with
eager
pleasure
,
"
do
he
?
<EOS>
do
Edmund
?
<EOS>
that
be
like
himself
.
<EOS>
no
other
man
would
have
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
honour
him
beyond
expression
.
"
<EOS>
and
she
look
around
as
if
long
to
tell
him
so
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
near
,
he
be
attend
a
party
of
lady
out
of
the
room
;
and
Mrs.
Grant
come
up
to
the
two
girl
,
and
take
an
arm
of
each
,
they
follow
with
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
's
heart
sink
,
but
there
be
no
leisure
for
think
long
even
of
Miss
Crawford
's
feeling
.
<EOS>
They
be
in
the
ballroom
,
the
violin
be
play
,
and
her
mind
be
in
a
flutter
that
forbid
its
fixing
on
anything
serious
.
<EOS>
She
must
watch
the
general
arrangement
,
and
see
how
everything
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
Sir
Thomas
come
to
her
,
and
ask
if
she
be
engage
;
and
the
"
yes
,
sir
;
to
Mr.
Crawford
,
"
be
exactly
what
he
have
intend
to
hear
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Crawford
be
not
far
off
;
Sir
Thomas
bring
him
to
her
,
say
something
which
discover
to
Fanny
,
that
_
she
_
be
to
lead
the
way
and
open
the
ball
;
an
idea
that
have
never
occur
to
her
before
.
<EOS>
whenever
she
have
think
of
the
minutia
of
the
evening
,
it
have
be
as
a
matter
of
course
that
Edmund
would
begin
with
Miss
Crawford
;
and
the
impression
be
so
strong
,
that
though
_
her
_
_
uncle
_
speak
the
contrary
,
she
could
not
help
an
exclamation
of
surprise
,
a
hint
of
her
unfitness
,
an
entreaty
even
to
be
excuse
.
<EOS>
to
be
urge
her
opinion
against
Sir
Thomas
's
be
a
proof
of
the
extremity
of
the
case
;
but
such
be
her
horror
at
the
first
suggestion
,
that
she
could
actually
look
him
in
the
face
and
say
that
she
hope
it
may
be
settle
otherwise
;
in
vain
,
however
:
Sir
Thomas
smile
,
try
to
encourage
her
,
and
then
look
too
serious
,
and
say
too
decidedly
,
"
It
must
be
so
,
my
dear
,
"
for
her
to
hazard
another
word
;
and
she
find
herself
the
next
moment
conduct
by
Mr.
Crawford
to
the
top
of
the
room
,
and
stand
there
to
be
join
by
the
rest
of
the
dancer
,
couple
after
couple
,
as
they
be
form
.
  
<EOS>
She
could
hardly
believe
it
.
<EOS>
to
be
place
above
so
many
elegant
young
woman
!
<EOS>
the
distinction
be
too
great
.
<EOS>
It
be
treat
her
like
her
cousin
!
<EOS>
and
her
thought
fly
to
those
absent
cousin
with
most
unfeigned
and
truly
tender
regret
,
that
they
be
not
at
home
to
take
their
own
place
in
the
room
,
and
have
their
share
of
a
pleasure
which
would
have
be
so
very
delightful
to
them
.
<EOS>
so
often
as
she
have
hear
them
wish
for
a
ball
at
home
as
the
great
of
all
felicity
!
<EOS>
and
to
have
them
away
when
it
be
give
 
and
for
_
her
_
to
be
open
the
ball
 
and
with
Mr.
Crawford
too
!
<EOS>
She
hope
they
would
not
envy
her
that
distinction
<EOS>
_
now
_
<EOS>
;
but
when
she
look
back
to
the
state
of
thing
in
the
autumn
,
to
what
they
have
all
be
to
each
other
when
once
dance
in
that
house
before
,
the
present
arrangement
be
almost
more
than
she
could
understand
herself
.
  
<EOS>
the
ball
begin
.
<EOS>
It
be
rather
honour
than
happiness
to
Fanny
,
for
the
first
dance
at
least
:
her
partner
be
in
excellent
spirit
,
and
try
to
impart
them
to
her
;
but
she
be
a
great
deal
too
much
frighten
to
have
any
enjoyment
till
she
could
suppose
herself
no
longer
look
at
.
<EOS>
young
,
pretty
,
and
gentle
,
however
,
she
have
no
awkwardness
that
be
not
as
good
as
grace
,
and
there
be
few
person
present
that
be
not
dispose
to
praise
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
attractive
,
she
be
modest
,
she
be
Sir
Thomas
's
niece
,
and
she
be
soon
say
to
be
admire
by
Mr.
Crawford
.
<EOS>
It
be
enough
to
give
her
general
favour
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
himself
be
watch
her
progress
down
the
dance
with
much
complacency
;
he
be
proud
of
his
niece
;
and
without
attribute
all
her
personal
beauty
,
as
Mrs.
Norris
seem
to
do
,
to
her
transplantation
to
Mansfield
,
he
be
pleased
with
himself
for
have
supply
everything
else
:
education
and
manner
she
owe
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
see
much
of
Sir
Thomas
's
thought

and
have
,
in
spite
of
all
his
wrong
towards
her
,
a
general
prevail
desire
of
recommend
herself
to
him
,
take
an
opportunity
of
step
aside
to
say
something
agreeable
of
Fanny
.
<EOS>
Her
praise
be
warm
,
and
he
receive
it
as
she
could
wish
,
join
in
it
as
far
as
discretion
,
and
politeness
,
and
slowness
of
speech
would
allow
,
and
certainly
appear
to
great
advantage
on
the
subject
than
his
lady
<EOS>
do
soon
afterwards
,
when
Mary
,
perceive
her
on
a
sofa
very
near
,
turn
round
before
she
begin
to
dance
,
to
compliment
her
on
Miss
Price
's
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
she
do
look
very
well
,
"
be
Lady
Bertram
's
placid
reply
.
"
<EOS>
Chapman
help
her
to
dress
.
<EOS>
I
send
Chapman
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
not
but
that
she
be
really
pleased
to
have
Fanny
admire
;
but
she
be
so
much
more
strike
with
her
own
kindness
in
send
Chapman
to
her
,
that
she
could
not
get
it
out
of
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
know
Mrs.
Norris
too
well
to
think
of
gratify
_
her
_
by
commendation
of
Fanny
;
to
her
,
it
be
as
the
occasion
offer
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
madam
,
how
much
we
want
dear
Mrs.
Rushworth
and
Julia
to
-
night
!
"
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Norris
pay
her
with
as
many
smile
and
courteous
word
as
she
have
time
for
,
amid
so
much
occupation
as
she
find
for
herself
in
make
up
card
-
table
,
give
hint
to
Sir
Thomas
,
and
try
to
move
all
the
chaperon
to
a
well
part
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
blunder
most
towards
Fanny
herself
in
her
intention
to
please
.
<EOS>
She
mean
to
be
give
her
little
heart
a
happy
flutter
,
and
fill
her
with
sensation
of
delightful
self
-
consequence
;
and
,
misinterpret
Fanny
's
blush
,
still
think
she
must
be
do
so
when
she
go
to
her
after
the
two
first
dance
,
and
say
,
with
a
significant
look
,
"
perhaps
_
you
_
can
tell
me
why
my
brother
go
to
town
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
He
say
he
have
business
there
,
but
will
not
tell
me
what
.
<EOS>
the
first
time
he
ever
deny
me
his
confidence
!
<EOS>
but
this
be
what
we
all
come
to
.
<EOS>
all
be
supplant
sooner
or
later
.
<EOS>
now
,
I
must
apply
to
you
for
information
.
<EOS>
pray
,
what
be
Henry
go
for
?
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
protest
her
ignorance
as
steadily
as
her
embarrassment
allow
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
"
reply
Miss
Crawford
,
laughing
,
"
I
must
suppose
it
to
be
purely
for
the
pleasure
of
convey
your
brother
,
and
of
talk
of
you
by
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
be
confused
,
but
it
be
the
confusion
of
discontent
;
while
Miss
Crawford
wonder
she
do
not
smile
,
and
think
her
over
-
anxious
,
or
think
her
odd
,
or
think
her
anything
rather
than
insensible
of
pleasure
in
Henry
's
attention
.
<EOS>
Fanny
have
a
good
deal
of
enjoyment
in
the
course
of
the
evening
;
but
Henry
's
attention
have
very
little
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
She
would
much
rather
_
not
_
have
be
ask
by
him
again
so
very
soon
,
and
she
wish
she
have
not
be
oblige
to
suspect
that
his
previous
inquiry
of
Mrs.
Norris
,
about
the
supper
hour
,
be
all
for
the
sake
of
secure
her
at
that
part
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
to
be
avoid
:
he
make
her
feel
that
she
be
the
object
of
all
;
though
she
could
not
say
that
it
be
unpleasantly
do
,
that
there
be
indelicacy
or
ostentation
in
his
manner
;
and
sometimes
,
when
he
talk
of
William
,
he
be
really
not
unagreeable
,
and
shew
even
a
warmth
of
heart
which
do
him
credit
.
<EOS>
but
still
his
attention
make
no
part
of
her
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
She
be
happy
whenever
she
look
at
William
,
and
see
how
perfectly
he
be
enjoy
himself
,
in
every
five
minute
that
she
could
walk
about
with
him
and
hear
his
account
of
his
partner
;
she
be
happy
in
know
herself
admire
;
and
she
be
happy
in
have
the
two
dance
with
Edmund
still
to
look
forward
to
,
<EOS>
during
the
great
part
of
the
evening
,
her
hand
be
so
eagerly
seek
after
that
her
indefinite
engagement
with
_
him
<EOS>
_
be
in
continual
perspective
.
<EOS>
She
be
happy
even
when
they
do
take
place
;
but
not
from
any
flow
of
spirit
on
his
side
,
or
any
such
expression
of
tender
gallantry
as
have
bless
the
morning
.
<EOS>
His
mind
be
fag
,
and
her
happiness
spring
from
be
the
friend
with
whom
it
could
find
repose
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
wear
out
with
civility
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
talk
incessantly
all
night
,
and
with
nothing
to
say
.
<EOS>
but
with
_
you
_
,
Fanny
,
there
may
be
peace
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
want
to
be
talk
to
.
<EOS>
let
us
have
the
luxury
of
silence
.
<EOS>
"
Fanny
would
hardly
even
speak
her
agreement
.
<EOS>
a
weariness
,
arise
probably
,
in
great
measure
,
from
the
same
feeling
which
he
have
acknowledge
in
the
morning
,
be
peculiarly
to
be
respect
,
and
they
go
down
their
two
dance
together
with
such
sober
tranquillity
as
may
satisfy
any
looker
-
on
that
Sir
Thomas
have
be
bring
up
no
wife
for
his
young
son
.
  
<EOS>
the
evening
have
afford
Edmund
little
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
have
be
in
gay
spirit
when
they
first
dance
together
,
but
it
be
not
her
gaiety
that
could
do
him
good
:
<EOS>
it
rather
sink
than
raise
his
comfort
;
and
afterwards
,
for
he
find
himself
still
impel
to
seek
her
again
<EOS>
,
she
have
absolutely
pain
him
by
her
manner
of
speak
of
the
profession
to
which
he
be
now
on
the
point
of
belonging
.
<EOS>
They
have
talk
,
and
they
have
be
silent
;
he
have
reason
,
she
have
ridicule
;
and
they
have
part
at
last
with
mutual
vexation
.
<EOS>
Fanny
,
not
able
to
refrain
entirely
from
observe
them
,
have
see
enough
to
be
tolerably
satisfied
.
<EOS>
It
be
barbarous
to
be
happy
when
Edmund
be
suffer
.
<EOS>
yet
some
happiness
must
and
would
arise
from
the
very
conviction
that
he
do
suffer
.
  
<EOS>
when
her
two
dance
with
him
be
over
,
her
inclination
and
strength
for
more
be
pretty
well
at
an
end
;
and
Sir
Thomas
,
have
see
her
walk
rather
than
dance
down
the
shortening
set
,
breathless
,
and
with
her
hand
at
her
side
,
give
his
order
for
her
sit
down
entirely
.
<EOS>
from
that
time
Mr.
Crawford
sit
down
likewise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Fanny
!
"
<EOS>
cry
William
,
come
for
a
moment
to
visit
her
,
and
work
away
his
partner
's
fan
as
if
for
life
,
"
how
soon
she
be
knock
up
!
<EOS>
why
,
the
sport
be
but
just
begin
.
<EOS>
I
hope
we
shall
keep
it
up
these
two
hour
.
<EOS>
how
can
you
be
tired
so
soon
?
"
  
"
so
soon
!
<EOS>
my
good
friend
,
"
say
Sir
Thomas
,
produce
his
watch
with
all
necessary
caution
;
"
it
be
three
o'clock
,
and
your
sister
be
not
use
to
these
sort
of
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
Fanny
,
you
shall
not
get
up
to

morrow
before
I
go

<EOS>
sleep
as
long
as
you
can
,
and
never

me

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh

William

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what

<EOS>
do
she
think
of
be
up
before
you
set
off
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
,
"
cry
Fanny
,
rise
eagerly
from
her
seat
to
be
nearer
her
uncle
;
"
I
must
get
up
and
breakfast
with
him
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
the
last
time
,
you
know
;
the
last
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
well
not
.
<EOS>
He
be
to
have
breakfast
and
be
go
by
half
-
past
nine
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Crawford
,
I
think
you
call
for
him
at
half
-
past
nine
?
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
be
too
urgent
,
however
,
and
have
too
many
tear
in
her
eye
for
denial
;
and
it
end
in
a
gracious
"
well
,
well
!
"
<EOS>
which
be
permission
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
half
-
past
nine
,
"
say
Crawford
to
William
as
the
latter
be
leave
them
,
"
and
I
shall
be
punctual
,
for
there
will
be
no
kind
sister
to
get
up
for
_
me
_
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
in
a
low
tone
to
Fanny
,
"
I
shall
have
only
a
desolate
house
to
hurry
from
.
<EOS>
Your
brother
will
find
my
idea
of
time
and
his
own
very
different
to
-
morrow
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
a
short
consideration
,
Sir
Thomas
ask
Crawford
to
join
the
early
breakfast
party
in
that
house
instead
of
eat
alone
:
he
should
himself
be
of
it
;
and
the
readiness
with
which
his
invitation
be
accept
convince
him
that
the
suspicion
whence
,
he
must
confess
to
himself
,
this
very
ball
have
in
great
measure
sprung
,
be
well
found
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Crawford
be
in
love
with
Fanny
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
pleasing
anticipation
of
what
would
be
.
<EOS>
His
niece
,
meanwhile
,
do
not
thank
him
for
what
he
have
just
do
.
<EOS>
She
have
hope
to
have
William
all
to
herself
the
last
morning
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
an
unspeakable
indulgence
.
<EOS>
but
though
her
wish
be
overthrow
,
there
be
no
spirit
of
murmuring
within
her
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
she
be
so
totally
unused
to
have
her
pleasure
consult
,
or
to
have
anything
take
place
at
all
in
the
way
she
could
desire
,
that
she
be
more
disposed
to
wonder
and
rejoice
in
have
carry
her
point
so
far
,
than
to
repine
at
the
counteraction
which
follow
.
  
<EOS>
shortly
afterward
,
Sir
Thomas
be
again
interfere
a
little
with
her
inclination
,
by
advise
her
to
go
immediately
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Advise
"
be
his
word
,
but
it
be
the
advice
of
absolute
power
,
and
she
have
only
to
rise
,
and
,
with
Mr.
Crawford
's
very
cordial
adieus
,
pass
quietly
away
;
stop
at
the
entrance
-
door
,
like
the
Lady
of
Branxholm
Hall
,
"
one
moment
and
no
more
,
"
to
view
the
happy
scene
,
and
take
a
last
look
at
the
five
or
six
determined
couple
who
be
still
hard
at
work
;
and
then
,
creep
slowly
up
the
principal
staircase
,
pursue
by
the
ceaseless
country
-
dance
,
feverish
with
hope
and
fear
,
soup
and
negus
,
sore
-
foot
and
fatigued
,
restless
and
agitate
,
yet
feel
,
in
spite
of
everything
,
that
a
ball
be
indeed
delightful
.
  
<EOS>
in
thus
send
her
away
,
Sir
Thomas
perhaps
may
not
be
think
merely
of
her
health
.
<EOS>
It
may
occur
to
him
that
Mr.
Crawford
have
be
sit
by
her
long
enough
,
or
he
may
mean
to
recommend
her
as
a
wife
by
shew
her
persuadableness
.
    
<EOS>
the
ball
be
over
,
and
the
breakfast
be
soon
over
too
;
the
last
kiss
be
give
,
and
William
be
go
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Crawford
have
,
as
he
foretell
,
be
very
punctual
,
and
short
and
pleasant
have
be
the
meal
.
  
<EOS>
after
see
William
to
the
last
moment
,
Fanny
walk
back
to
the
breakfast
-
room
with
a
very
saddened
heart
to
grieve
over
the
melancholy
change
;
and
there
her
uncle
kindly
leave
her
to
cry
in
peace
,
conceiving
,
perhaps
,
that
the
desert
chair
of
each
young
man
may
exercise
her
tender
enthusiasm
,
and
that
the
remain
cold
pork
bone
and
mustard
in
William
's
plate
may
but
divide
her
feeling
with
the
broken
egg
-
shell
in
Mr.
Crawford
's
.
<EOS>
She
sit
and
cry
_
con
_
_
amore
_
as
her
uncle
intend
,
but
it
be
_
con
<EOS>
_
_
amore
_
fraternal
and
no
other
.
<EOS>
William
be
go
,
and
she
now
feel
as
if
she
have
waste
half
his
visit
in
idle
care
and
selfish
solicitude
unconnecte
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
's
disposition
be
such
that
she
could
never
even
think
of
her
aunt
Norris
in
the
meagreness
and
cheerlessness
of
her
own
small
house
,
without
reproach
herself
for
some
little
want
of
attention
to
her
when
they
have
be
last
together
;
much
less
could
her
feeling
acquit
her
of
have
do
and
say
and
think
everything
by
William
that
be
due
to
him
for
a
whole
fortnight
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
heavy
,
melancholy
day
.
<EOS>
soon
after
the
second
breakfast
,
Edmund
bid
them
good
-
bye
for
a
week
,
and
mount
his
horse
for
Peterborough
,
and
then
all
be
go
.
<EOS>
nothing
remain
of
last
night
but
remembrance
,
which
she
have
nobody
to
share
in
.
<EOS>
She
talk
to
her
aunt
<EOS>
Bertram
 
<EOS>
she
must
talk
to
somebody
of
the
ball
;
but
her
aunt
have
see
so
little
of
what
have
pass
,
and
have
so
little
curiosity
,
that
it
be
heavy
work
.
<EOS>
Lady
Bertram
be
not
certain
of
anybody
's
dress
or
anybody
's
place
at
supper
but
her
own
.
<EOS>
"
She
could
not
recollect
what
it
be
that
she
have
hear
about
one
of
the
Miss
Maddoxes
,
or
what
it
be
that
Lady
Prescott
have
notice
in
Fanny
:
she
be
not
sure
whether
Colonel
Harrison
have
be
talk
of
Mr.
Crawford
or
of
William
when
he
say
he
be
the
fine
young
man
in
the
room
 
somebody
have
whisper
something
to
her
;
she
have
forget
to
ask
Sir
Thomas
what
it
could
be
.
"
<EOS>
and
these
be
her
long
speech
and
clear
communication
:
the
rest
be
only
a
languid
"
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
;
very
well
;
do
you
?
<EOS>
do
he
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
_
that
_
;
I
should
not
know
one
from
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
very
bad
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
well
than
Mrs.
Norris
's
sharp
answer
would
have
be
;
but
she
be
go
home
with
all
the
supernumerary
jelly
to
nurse
a
sick
maid
,
there
be
peace
and
good
-
humour
in
their
little
party
,
though
it
could
not
boast
much
beside
.
  
<EOS>
the
evening
be
heavy
like
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
think
what
be
the
matter
with
me
,
"
say
Lady
Bertram
,
when
the
tea
-
thing
be
remove
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
quite
stupid
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
sit
up
so
late
last
night
.
<EOS>
Fanny
,
you
must
do
something
to
keep
me
awake
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
work
.
<EOS>
fetch
the
card
;
I
feel
so
very
stupid
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
card
be
bring
,
and
Fanny
play
at
cribbage
with
her
aunt
till
bedtime
;
and
as
Sir
Thomas
be
read
to
himself
,
no
sound
be
hear
in
the
room
for
the
next
two
hour
beyond
the
reckoning
of
the
game
 
"
<EOS>
and
_
that
_
make
thirty
-
one
;
four
in
hand
and
eight
in
crib
.
<EOS>
You
be
to
deal
,
madam
;
shall
I
deal
for
you
?
"
<EOS>
Fanny
think
and
think
again
of
the
difference
which
twenty
-
four
hour
have
make
in
that
room
,
and
all
that
part
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
last
night
it
have
be
hope
and
smile
,
bustle
and
motion
,
noise
and
brilliancy
,
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
out
of
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
everywhere
.
<EOS>
now
it
be
languor
,
and
all
but
solitude
.
  
<EOS>
a
good
night
's
rest
improve
her
spirit
.
<EOS>
She
could
think
of
William
the
next
day
more
cheerfully
;
and
as
the
morning
afford
her
an
opportunity
of
talk
over
Thursday
night
with
Mrs.
Grant
and
Miss
Crawford
,
in
a
very
handsome
style
,
with
all
the
heightening
of
imagination
,
and
all
the
laugh
of
playfulness
which
be
so
essential
to
the
shade
of
a
depart
ball
,
she
could
afterwards
bring
her
mind
without
much
effort
into
its
everyday
state
,
and
easily
conform
to
the
tranquillity
of
the
present
quiet
week
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
indeed
a
small
party
than
she
have
ever
know
there
for
a
whole
day
together
,
and
_
he
_
be
go
on
whom
the
comfort
and
cheerfulness
of
every
family
meeting
and
every
meal
chiefly
depend
.
<EOS>
but
this
must
be
learn
to
be
endure
.
<EOS>
He
would
soon
be
always
go
;
and
she
be
thankful
that
she
could
now
sit
in
the
same
room
with
her
uncle
,
hear
his
voice
,
receive
his
question
,
and
even
answer
them
,
without
such
wretched
feeling
as
she
have
formerly
know
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
miss
our
two
young
man
,
"
be
Sir
Thomas
's
observation
on
both
the
first
and
second
day
,
as
they
form
their
very
reduce
circle
after
dinner
;
and
in
consideration
of
Fanny
's
swimming
eye
,
nothing
more
be
say
on
the
first
day
than
to
drink
their
good
health
;
but
on
the
second
it
lead
to
something
farther
.
<EOS>
William
be
kindly
commend
and
his
promotion
hope
for
.
"
<EOS>
and
there
be
no
reason
to
suppose
,
"
add
Sir
Thomas
,
"
but
that
his
visit
to
us
may
now
be
tolerably
frequent
.
<EOS>
as
to
Edmund
,
we
must
learn
to
do
without
him
.
<EOS>
this
will
be
the
last
winter
of
his
belonging
to
us
,
as
he
have
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Lady
Bertram
,
"
but
I
wish
he
be
not
go
away
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
go
away
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
I
wish
they
would
stay
at
home
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
wish
be
level
principally
at
Julia
,
who
have
just
apply
for
permission
to
go
to
town
with
Maria
;
and
as
Sir
Thomas
think
it
best
for
each
daughter
that
the
permission
should
be
grant
,
Lady
Bertram
,
though
in
her
own
good
-
nature
she
would
not
have
prevent
it
,
be
lament
the
change
it
make
in
the
prospect
of
Julia
's
return
,
which
would
otherwise
have
take
place
about
this
time
.
<EOS>
a
great
deal
of
good
sense
follow
on
Sir
Thomas
's
side
,
tend
to
reconcile
his
wife
to
the
arrangement
.
<EOS>
everything
that
a
considerate
parent
_
ought
_
to
feel
be
advanced
for
her
use
;
and
everything
that
an
affectionate
mother
_
<EOS>
must
_
feel
in
promote
her
child
's
enjoyment
be
attribute
to
her
nature
.
<EOS>
Lady
Bertram
agree
to
it
all
with
a
calm
"
yes
"
;
and
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
's
silent
consideration
spontaneously
observe
,
"
Sir
Thomas
,
I
have
be
think
 
and
I
be
very
glad
we
take
Fanny
as
we
do
,
<EOS>
for
now
the
other
be
away
<EOS>
we
feel
the
good
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
immediately
improve
this
compliment
by
add
,
"
very
true
.
<EOS>
We
shew
Fanny
<EOS>
what
a
good
girl
<EOS>
we
think
her
by
praise
her
to
her
face
,
she
be
now
a
very
valuable
companion
.
<EOS>
if
we
have
be
kind
to
_
<EOS>
her
_
,
she
be
now
quite
as
necessary
to
_
us
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Lady
Bertram
presently
;
"
and
it
be
a
comfort
to
think
that
we
shall
always
have
_
her
_
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
pause
,
half
smile
,
glance
at
his
niece
,
and
then
gravely
reply
,
"
She
will
never
leave
us
,
I
hope
,
till
invite
to
some
other
home
that
may
reasonably
promise
her
great
happiness
than
she
know
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
_
that
_
be
not
very
likely
to
be
,
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
who
should
invite
her
?
<EOS>
Maria
may
be
very
glad
to
see
her
at
Sotherton
now
and
then
,
but
she
would
not
think
of
ask
her
to
live
there
;
and
I
be
sure
she
be
well
off
here
;
and
besides
,
I
can
not
do
without
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
week
which
pass
so
quietly
and
peaceably
at
the
great
house
in
Mansfield
have
a
very
different
character
at
the
Parsonage
.
<EOS>
to
the
young
lady
,
at
least
,
in
each
family
,
it
bring
very
different
feeling
.
<EOS>
what
be
tranquillity
and
comfort
to
Fanny
be
tediousness
and
vexation
to
Mary
.
<EOS>
something
arise
from
difference
of
disposition
and
habit
:
one
so
easily
satisfied
,
the
other
so
unused
to
endure
;
but
still
more
may
be
impute
to
difference
of
circumstance
.
<EOS>
in
some
point
of
interest
they
be
exactly
oppose
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
to
Fanny
's
mind
,
Edmund
's
absence
be
really
,
in
its
cause
and
its
tendency
,
a
relief
.
<EOS>
to
Mary
it
be
every
way
painful
.
<EOS>
She
feel
the
want
of
his
society
every
day
,
almost
every
hour
,
and
be
too
much
in
want
of
it
to
derive
anything
but
irritation
from
consider
the
object
for
which
he
go
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
devise
anything
more
likely
to
raise
his
consequence
than
this
week
's
absence
,
occur
as
it
do
at
the
very
time
of
her
brother
's
go
away
,
of
William
Price
be
go
too
,
and
complete
the
sort
of
general
break
-
up
of
a
party
which
have
be
so
animate
.
<EOS>
She
feel
it
keenly
.
<EOS>
They
be
now
a
miserable
trio
,
confine
within
door
by
a
series
of
rain
and
snow
,
with
nothing
to
do
and
no
variety
to
hope
for
.
<EOS>
angry
as
she
be
with
Edmund
for
adhere
to
his
own
notion
,
and
act
on
them
in
defiance
of
her
<EOS>
(
and
she
have
be
so
angry
that
they
have
hardly
part
friend
at
the
ball
)
,
she
could
not
help
think
of
him
continually
when
absent
,
dwell
on
his
merit
and
affection
,
and
longing
again
for
the
almost
daily
meeting
they
lately
have
.
<EOS>
His
absence
be
unnecessarily
long
.
<EOS>
He
should
not
have
plan
such
an
absence
 
he
should
not
have
leave
home
for
a
week
,
when
her
own
departure
from
Mansfield
be
so
near
.
<EOS>
then
she
begin
to
blame
herself
.
<EOS>
She
wish
she
have
not
speak
so
warmly
in
their
last
conversation
.
<EOS>
She
be
afraid
she
have
use
some
strong
,
some
contemptuous
expression
in
speak
of
the
clergy
,
and
that
should
not
have
be
.
<EOS>
It
be
ill
-
breed
;
it
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
She
wish
such
word
unsaid
with
all
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Her
vexation
do
not
end
with
the
week
.
<EOS>
all
this
be
bad
,
but
she
have
still
more
to
feel
when
Friday
come
round
again
and
bring
no
Edmund
;
when
Saturday
come
and
still
no
Edmund
;
and
when
,
through
the
slight
communication
with
the
other
family
which
Sunday
produce
,
she
learn
that
he
have
actually
write
home
to
defer
his
return
,
have
promise
to
remain
some
day
longer
with
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
if
she
have
feel
impatience
and
regret
before
 
if
she
have
be
sorry
for
what
she
say
,
and
fear
its
too
strong
effect
on
him
 
she
now
feel
and
fear
it
all
tenfold
more
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
moreover
,
to
contend
with
one
disagreeable
emotion
entirely
new
to
her
 
jealousy
.
<EOS>
His
friend
Mr.
Owen
have
sister
;
he
may
find
them
attractive
.
<EOS>
but
,
at
any
rate
,
his
stay
away
at
a
time
when
,
accord
to
all
precede
plan
,
she
be
to
remove
to
London
,
mean
something
that
she
could
not
bear
.
<EOS>
have
Henry
return
,
as
he
talk
of
do
,
at
the
end
of
three
or
four
day
,
she
should
now
have
be
leave
Mansfield
.
<EOS>
It
become
absolutely
necessary
for
her
to
get
to
Fanny
and
try
to
learn
something
more
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
live
any
longer
in
such
solitary
wretchedness
;
and
she
make
her
way
to
the
Park
,
through
difficulty
of
walk
which
she
have
deem
unconquerable
a
week
before
,
for
the
chance
of
hear
a
little
in
addition
,
for
the
sake
of
at
least
hear
his
name
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
half
-
hour
be
lose
,
for
Fanny
and
Lady
Bertram
be
together
,
and
unless
she
have
Fanny
to
herself
she
could
hope
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
but
at
last
Lady
Bertram
leave
the
room
,
and
then
almost
immediately
Miss
Crawford
thus
begin
,
with
a
voice
as
well
regulate
as
she
could
 
"
and
how
do
_
<EOS>
you
_
like
<EOS>
your
cousin
Edmund
's
stay
away
so
long
?
<EOS>
be
the
only
young
person
at
home
,
I
consider
_
you
_
<EOS>
as
the
great
sufferer
.
<EOS>
You
must
miss
him
.
<EOS>
do
his
stay
longer
surprise
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
say
Fanny
hesitatingly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
;
I
have
not
particularly
expect
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
he
will
always
stay
longer
than
he
talk
of
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
general
way
all
young
man
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
do
not
,
the
only
time
he
go
to
see
Mr.
Owen
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
find
the
house
more
agreeable
_
now
_
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
very
 
a
very
pleasing
young
man
himself
,
and
I
can
not
help
be
rather
concerned
at
not
see
him
again
before
I
go
to
London
,
as
will
now
undoubtedly
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
I
be
look
for
Henry
every
day
,
and
as
soon
as
he
come
there
will
be
nothing
to
detain
me
at
Mansfield
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
have
see
him
once
more
,
I
confess
.
<EOS>
but
you
must
give
my
compliment
to
him
.
<EOS>
yes
;
I
think
it
must
be
compliment
.
<EOS>
be
not
there
a
something
want
,
Miss
Price
,
in
our
language
 
a
something
between
compliment
and
 
and
love
 
to
suit
the
sort
of
friendly
acquaintance
we
have
have
together
?
<EOS>
so
many
month
'
acquaintance
!
<EOS>
but
compliment
may
be
sufficient
here
.
<EOS>
be
his
letter
a
long
one
?
<EOS>
do
he
give
you
much
account
of
what
he
be
do
?
<EOS>
be
it
Christmas
gaiety
that
he
be
stay
for
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
hear
a
part
of
the
letter
;
it
be
to
my
uncle
;
but
I
believe
it
be
very
short
;
indeed
I
be
sure
it
be
but
<EOS>
a
few
line
.
<EOS>
all
that
I
hear
be
that
his
friend
have
press
him
to
stay
longer
,
and
that
he
have
agree
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
a
_
few
_
day
longer
,
or
_
<EOS>
some
_
day
longer
;
I
be
not
quite
sure
which
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
if
he
write
to
his
father
;
but
I
think
it
may
have
be
to
Lady
Bertram
or
you
.
<EOS>
but
if
he
write
to
his
father
,
no
wonder
he
be
concise
.
<EOS>
who
could
write
chat
to
Sir
Thomas
?
<EOS>
if
he
have
write
to
you
,
there
would
have
be
more
particular
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
hear
of
ball
and
party
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
send
you
a
description
of
everything
and
everybody
.
<EOS>
how
many
Miss
Owens
be
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
three
grow
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
they
musical
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
at
all
know
.
<EOS>
I
never
hear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
first
question
,
you
know
,
"
say
Miss
Crawford
,
try
to
appear
gay
and
unconcerned
,
"
which
every
woman
who
play
herself
be
sure
to
ask
about
another
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
very
foolish
to
ask
question
about
any
young
lady
 
about
any
three
sister
just
grow
up
;
for
one
know
,
without
be
tell
,
exactly
what
they
be
:
<EOS>
all
very
accomplished
and
pleasing
,
and
one
very
pretty
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
beauty
in
every
family
;
it
be
a
regular
thing
.
<EOS>
two
play
on
the
pianoforte
,
and
one
on
the
harp
;
and
all
sing
,
or
would
sing
if
they
be
teach
,
or
sing
all
the
well
for
not
be
teach
;
or
something
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
of
the
Miss
Owens
,
"
say
Fanny
calmly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
nothing
and
you
care
less
,
as
people
say
.
<EOS>
never
do
tone
express
indifference
plainer
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
how
can
one
care
for
those
one
have
never
see
?
<EOS>
well
,
when
your
cousin
come
back
,
he
will
find
Mansfield
very
quiet
;
all
the
noisy
one
go
,
your
brother
and
mine
and
myself
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
the
idea
of
leave
Mrs.
Grant
<EOS>
now
the
time
draw
near
.
<EOS>
She
do

You

Miss

hope

hear
some
pleasant
assurance
of

power
from

Miss

a

that
he

the

as

what
a
match
for
her

<EOS>
My
dear
Henry
,
this
must
be
my
_
first
_
feeling
;
but
my
_
second
_
,
which
you
shall
have
as
sincerely
,
be
,
that
I
approve
your
choice
from
my

and
foresee

as
heartily

I

desire

<EOS>
You
will
have
a
sweet
little
wife

all
gratitude

devotion

<EOS>
exactly
what
you
deserve

<EOS>
what
an
amazing
match
for
her
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
often
talk

her
luck

what
will
she
say
now
?
<EOS>
the
delight
of
all

indeed
!
<EOS>
and
she
have
some
_
true
_
friend
in
it

<EOS>
how
_
they
_
will
rejoice
!
<EOS>
but
tell
me
all
about
it
!
<EOS>
talk
to
me
for
ever
.
<EOS>
when
do
you
begin
to
think
seriously
about
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
impossible
than
to
answer
such
a
question
,
though
nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
than
to
have
it
ask
.
<EOS>
"
how
the
pleasing
plague
have
steal
on
him
"
he
could
not
say
;
and
before
he
have
express
the
same
sentiment
with
a
little
variation
of
word
three
time
over
,
his
sister
eagerly
interrupt
him
with
,
"
<EOS>
ah
,
my
dear
Henry
,
and
this
be
what
take
you
to
London
!
<EOS>
this
be
your
business
!
<EOS>
You
choose
to
consult
the
Admiral
before
you
make
up
your
mind
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
this
he
stoutly
deny
.
<EOS>
He
know
his
uncle
too
well
to
consult
him
on
any
matrimonial
scheme
.
<EOS>
the
Admiral
hate
marriage
,
and
think
it
never
pardonable
in
a
young
man
of
independent
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
Fanny
be
know
to
him
,
"
continue
Henry
,
"
he
will
doat
on
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
exactly
the
woman
to
do
away
every
prejudice
of
such
a
man
as
the
Admiral
,
for
she
he
would
describe
,
if
indeed
he
have
now
delicacy
of
language
enough
to
embody
his
own
idea

<EOS>
but
till
it
be
absolutely
settle
 
settle
beyond
all
interference
,
he
shall
know
nothing
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
no
,
Mary
,
you
be
quite
mistaken
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
discover
my
business
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
I
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
I
know
now
to
whom
it
must
relate
,
and
be
in
no
hurry
for
the
rest

<EOS>
Fanny
Price
!
<EOS>
wonderful
,
quite
wonderful
!
<EOS>
that
Mansfield
should
have
do
so
much
for
 
that
_
you
_
should
have
find
your
fate
in
Mansfield
!
<EOS>
but
you
be
quite
right
;
you
could
not
have
choose
better
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
well
girl
in
the
world
,
and
you
do
not
want
for
fortune
;
and
as
to
her
connexion
,
they
be
more
than
good
.
<EOS>
the
Bertrams
be
undoubtedly
some
of
the
first
people
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
She
be
niece
to
Sir
Thomas
Bertram
;
that
will
be
enough
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
but
go
on
,
go
on
.
<EOS>
tell
me
more
.
<EOS>
what
be
your
plan
?
<EOS>
do
she
know
her
own
happiness
?
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
no

"
  
<EOS>

what

you

very
little
more

opportunity

Mary
,
she
be
not
like
her
cousin
;
but
I
think
I
shall
not
ask
in
vain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
no
!
<EOS>
you
can
not
.
<EOS>
be
you
even
less
pleasing
 
suppose
her
not
to
love
you
already
(
of
which
,
however
,
I
can
have
little
doubt
)
 
<EOS>
you
would
be
safe
.
<EOS>
the
gentleness
and
gratitude
of
her
disposition
would
secure
her
all
your
own
immediately

<EOS>
from
my
soul
I
do
not
think
she
would
marry
you
_
without
_
love
;
that
is
,
if
there
be
a
girl
in
the
world
capable
of
be
uninfluence
by
ambition
,
I
can
suppose
it
her
;
but
ask
her
to
love
you
,
and
she
will
never
have
the
heart
to
refuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
her
eagerness
could
rest
in
silence
,
he
be
as
happy
to
tell
as
she
could
be
to
listen
;
and
a
conversation
follow
almost
as
deeply
interesting
to
her
as
to
himself
,
though
he
have
in
fact
nothing
to
relate
but
his
own
sensation
,
nothing
to
dwell
on
but
Fanny
's
charm
.
<EOS>
Fanny
's
beauty
of
face
and
figure
,
Fanny
's
grace
of
manner
and
goodness
of
heart
,
be
the
exhaustless
theme
.
<EOS>
the
gentleness
,
modesty
,
and
sweetness
of
her
character
be
warmly
expatiate
on
;
that
sweetness
which
make
so
essential
a
part
of
every
woman
's
worth
in
the
judgment
of
man
,
that
though
he
sometimes
love
where
it
be
not
,
he
can
never
believe
it
absent
.
<EOS>
Her
temper
he
have
good
reason
to
depend
on
and
to
praise
.
<EOS>
He
have
often
see
it
try
.
<EOS>
be
there
one
of
the
family
,
except
Edmund
,
<EOS>
who
have
not
in
some
way
or
other
continually
exercise
her
patience
and
forbearance
?
<EOS>
Her
affection
be
evidently
strong
.
<EOS>
to
see
her
with
her
brother
!
<EOS>
what
could
more
delightfully
prove
that
the
warmth
of
her
heart
be
equal
to
its
gentleness
?
<EOS>
what
could
be
more
encouraging
to
a
man
who
have
her
love
in
view
?
<EOS>
then
,
her
understanding
be
beyond
every
suspicion
,
quick
and
clear
;
and
her
manner
be
the
mirror
of
her
own
modest
and
elegant
mind
.
<EOS>
nor
be
this
all
.
<EOS>
Henry
Crawford
have
too
much
sense
not
to
feel
the
worth
of
good
principle
in
a
wife
,
though
he
be
too
little
accustomed
to
serious
reflection
to
know
them
by
their
proper
name
;
but
when
he
talk
of
her
have
such
a
steadiness
and
regularity
of
conduct
,
such
a
high
notion
of
honour
,
and
such
an
observance
of
decorum
as
may
warrant
any
man
in
the
full
dependence
on
her
faith
and
integrity
,
he
express
what
be
inspire
by
the
knowledge
of
her
be
well
principled
and
religious

<EOS>
"
I
could
so
wholly
and
absolutely
confide
in
her

"
say
he
;
"
and
_
that
_
be
what
I
want
.

"
  
<EOS>
well
may
his
sister
,
believe
as
she
really
do
that
his
opinion
of
Fanny
Price
be
scarcely
beyond
her
merit
,
rejoice
in
her
prospect
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
more
I
think
of
it

she
cry
,
"
the
more
am

I
convince
that
you

quite
right

I

never

select
Fanny

most
likely

attach
you

I
be

you
happy

will
both
find
your
good

<EOS>

It
be
bad

very
bad
in
me
against
such
a
creature

I
do
not
know
her
then
;
and
she
shall
have
no
reason
to
lament
the
hour
that
first
put
it
into
my
head

I
will
make
her
very
happy

Mary

happy
than

ever

be
herself

ever

anybody
else

I
will
not
take
her
from
Northamptonshire

I
shall
let
Everingham

rent
a
place

Lodge

when
she
have
speak
it

she
recollect
herself
,
and
wish
it
unsaid

there
be
no

of
confusion

My

the
advantage
to
you

get
away
from
the
Admiral
before
your
manner
be
hurt
by
the
contagion
of
his
,
before
you

contract
any
of

opinion

,
in

your

the
saving
of
you

<EOS>
to
have
see
you
grow
like
the
Admiral

Henry

I

so
highly

suppose
the

have
half
the
reason

use

have
to
abhor
the
very
name

I
would
prevent
the
marriage

if
possible

I
know
you
:
I
know
that
a
wife
you
_
love
_
would
be
the
happy
of
woman
,
and
that
even
when
you
cease
to
love
,
she
would
yet
find
in
you
the
liberality
and
good
-
breeding
of
a
gentleman

<EOS>
the
impossibility
of
not
do
everything
in
the
world
to
make
Fanny
Price
happy
,
or
of
cease
to
love
Fanny
Price

the

you

all

so

exert
whatever
interest

on

this
have
be
his
business

<EOS>
He
have
communicate
it
to
no

he
have
not
breathe
a
syllable
of
it
even
to
Mary

while
uncertain
of
the
issue
,
he
could
not
have
bear
any
participation
of
his
feeling

this
have
be
his
business

with
such
a

of
what

have

such
strong
expression

_
tell

that
Fanny
could
not
have
remain
insensible
of
his
drift

have
she
be
able
to
attend
;
but
her
heart
be
so
full
and
her
sense
still
so
astonished
,
that
she
could
listen
but
imperfectly
even
to
what
he
tell
her
of
William

and
say
only
when
he
pause
,
"
how
kind

up

out

know
it

soon

this
could
not

suffer

the
opportunity
be

fair

impatient

her

must
not
go

she
must
allow
him
five

take
her
hand

her
back
to
her
seat

middle
of

suspect

when
she
do
understand
it

however

find
herself
expect
to
believe

create
sensation
which
his
heart
have
never

that
everything
he
have
do

to
be
place
to
the
account

excessive

unequalle
attachment

distressed

for
some
moment
unable

consider
it
all
as
nonsense

as
mere
trifling
and
gallantry

which
mean
only
to
deceive
for
the
hour

she
could
not
but
feel
that
it
be
treat
her
improperly

unworthily
,
and
in
such
a
way
as
she
have
not
deserve
;
but
it
be
like
himself
,
and
entirely
of
a
piece
with
what
she
have
see
before
;
and
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
shew
half
the
displeasure
she
feel
,
because
he
have
be
confer
an
obligation
,
which
no
want
of
delicacy
on
his
part
could
make
a
trifle
to
her
.
<EOS>
while
her
heart
be
still
bound
with
joy
and
gratitude
on
William
's
behalf
,
she
could
not
be
severely
resentful
of
anything
that
injure
only
herself
;
and
after
have
twice
draw
back
her
hand
,
and
twice
attempt
in
vain
to
turn
away
from
him
,
she
get
up
,
and
say
only
,
with
much
agitation
,
"
do
not
,
Mr.
Crawford
,
pray
do
not
!
<EOS>
I
beg
you
would
not
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
sort
of
talking
which
be
very
unpleasant
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
must
go
away
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
"
but
he
be
still
talk
on
,
describe
his
affection
,
solicit
a
return
,
and
,
finally
,
in
word
so
plain
as
to
bear
but
one
mean
even
to
her
,
offer
himself
,
hand
,
fortune
,
everything
,
to
her
acceptance
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
;
he
have
say
it
.
<EOS>
Her
astonishment
and
confusion
increase
;
and
though
still
not
know
how
to
suppose
him
serious
,
she
could
hardly
stand
.
<EOS>
He
press
for
an
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
no
!
"
<EOS>
she
cry
,
hide
her
face
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
all
nonsense
.
<EOS>
do
not
distress
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
hear
no
more
of
this
.
<EOS>
Your
kindness
to
William
make
me
more
obliged
to
you
than
word
can
express
;
but
I
do
not
want
,
I
can
not
bear
,
I
must
not
listen
to
such
 
no
,
no
,
do
not
think
of
me
.
<EOS>
but
you
be
_
not
_
think
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
be
all
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
have
burst
away
from
him
,
and
at
that
moment
Sir
Thomas
be
hear
speak
to
a
servant
in
his
way
towards
the
room
they
be
in
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
time
for
farth
assurance
or
entreaty
,
though
to
part
with
her
at
a
moment
when
her
modesty
alone
seem
,
to
his
sanguine
and
preassure
mind
,
to
stand
in
the
way
of
the
happiness
he
seek
,
be
a
cruel
necessity
.
<EOS>
She
rush
out
at
an
opposite
door
from
the
one
her
uncle
be
approach
,
and
be
walk
up
and
down
the
East
room
in
the
utmost
confusion
of
contrary
feeling
,
before
Sir
Thomas
's
politeness
or
apology
be
over
,
or
he
have
reach
the
beginning
of
the
joyful
intelligence
which
his
visitor
come
to
communicate
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
feel
,
think
,
tremble
about
everything
;
agitate
,
happy
,
miserable
,
infinitely
oblige
,
absolutely
angry
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
beyond
belief
!
<EOS>
He
be
inexcusable
,
incomprehensible
!
<EOS>
but
such
be
his
habit
that
he
could
do
nothing
without
a
mixture
of
evil
.
<EOS>
He
have
previously
make
her
the
happy
of
human
being
,
and
now
he
have
insult
 
<EOS>
she
know
not
what
to
say
,
how
to
class
,
or
how
to
regard
it
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
have
him
be
serious
,
and
yet
what
could
excuse
the
use
of
such
word
and
offer
,
if
they
mean
but
to
trifle
?
  
<EOS>
but
William
be
a
lieutenant
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
that
_
be
a
fact
beyond
a
doubt
,
and
without
an
alloy
.
<EOS>
She
would
think
of
it
for
ever
and
forget
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Crawford
would
certainly
never
address
her
so
again
:
he
must
have
see
how
unwelcome
it
be
to
her
;
and
in
that
case
,
how
gratefully
she
could
esteem
him
for
his
friendship
to
William
!
  
<EOS>
She
would
not
stir
farther
from
the
East
room
than
the
head
of
the
great
staircase
,
till
she
have
satisfy
herself
of
Mr.
Crawford
's
have
leave
the
house
;
but
when
convince
of
his
be
go
,
she
be
eager
to
go
down
and
be
with
her
uncle
,
and
have
all
the
happiness
of
his
joy
as
well
as
her
own
,
and
all
the
benefit
of
his
information
or
his
conjecture
as
to
what
would
now
be
William
's
destination
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
be
as
joyful
as
she
could
desire
,
and
very
kind
and
communicative
;
and
she
have
so
comfortable
a
talk
with
him
about
William
<EOS>
as
to
make
her
feel
as
if
nothing
have
occur
to
vex
her
,
till
she
find
,
towards
the
close
,
that
Mr.
Crawford
be
engage
to
return
and
dine
there
that
very
day
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
most
unwelcome
hearing
,
for
though
he
may
think
nothing
of
what
have
pass
,
it
would
be
quite
distressing
to
her
to
see
him
again
so
soon
.
  
<EOS>
She
try
to
get
the
well
of
it
;
try
very
hard
,
as
the
dinner
hour
approach
,
to
feel
and
appear
as
usual
;
but
it
be
quite
impossible
for
her
not
to
look
most
shy
and
uncomfortable
when
their
visitor
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
have
suppose
it
in
the
power
of
any
concurrence
of
circumstance
to
give
her
so
many
painful
sensation
on
the
first
day
of
hearing
of
William
's
promotion
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Crawford
be
not
only
in
the
room
 
<EOS>
he
be
soon
close
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
note
to
deliver
from
his
sister
.
<EOS>
Fanny
could
not
look
at
him
,
but
there
be
no
consciousness
of
past
folly
in
his
voice
.
<EOS>
She
open
her
note
immediately
,
glad
to
have
anything
to
do
,
and
happy
,
as
she
read
it
,
to
feel
that
the
fidgeting
of
her
aunt
Norris
,
who
be
also
to
dine
there
,
screen
her
a
little
from
view
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Fanny
,
 
for
so
I
may
now
always
call
you
,
to
the
infinite
relief
of
a
tongue
that
have
be
stumble
at
_
Miss
_
_
Price
_
for
at
least
the
last
six
week
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
let
my
brother
go
without
send
you
a
few
line
of
general
congratulation
,
and
give
my
most
joyful
consent
and
approval
.
<EOS>
go
on
,
my
dear
Fanny
,
and
without
fear
;
there
can
be
no
difficulty
worth
name
.
<EOS>
I
chuse
to
suppose
that
the
assurance
of
my
consent
will
be
something
;
so
you
may
smile
upon
him
with
your
sweetest
smile
this
afternoon
,
and
send
him
back
to
me
even
happier
than
he
go
.
 
<EOS>
yours
affectionately
,
M.
C.
"
  
<EOS>
these
be
not
expression
to
do
Fanny
any
good
;
for
though
she
read
in
too
much
haste
and
confusion
to
form
the
clear
judgment
of
Miss
Crawford
's
meaning
,
it
be
evident
that
she
mean
to
compliment
her
on
her
brother
's
attachment
,
and
even
to
_
appear
_
to
believe
it
serious
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
know
what
to
do
,
or
what
to
think
.
<EOS>
there
be
wretchedness
in
the
idea
of
its
be
serious
;
there
be
perplexity
and
agitation
every
way
.
<EOS>
She
be
distress
whenever
Mr.
Crawford
speak
to
her
,
and
he
speak
to
her
much
too
often
;
and
she
be
afraid
there
be
a
something
in
his
voice
and
manner
in
address
her
very
different
from
what
they
be
when
he
talk
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
Her
comfort
in
that
day
's
dinner
be
quite
destroy
:
she
could
hardly
eat
anything
;
and
when
Sir
Thomas
good
-
humouredly
observe
that
joy
have
take
away
her
appetite
,
she
be
ready
to
sink
with
shame
,
from
the
dread
of
Mr.
Crawford
's
interpretation
;
for
though
nothing
could
have
tempt
her
to
turn
her
eye
to
the
right
hand
,
where
he
sit
,
she
feel
that
_
his
_
be
immediately
direct
towards
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
more
silent
than
ever
.
<EOS>
She
would
hardly
join
even
when
William
be
the
subject
,
for
his
commission
come
all
from
the
right
hand
too
,
and
there
be
pain
in
the
connexion
.
  
<EOS>
She
think
Lady
Bertram
sit
longer
than
ever
,
and
begin
to
be
in
despair
of
ever
get
away
;
but
at
last
they
be
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
she
be
able
to
think
as
she
would
,
while
her
aunt
finish
the
subject
of
William
's
appointment
in
their
own
style
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
seem
as
much
delighted
with
the
saving
it
would
be
to
Sir
Thomas
as
with
any
part
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
now
_
William
would
be
able
to
keep
himself
,
which
would
make
a
vast
difference
to
his
uncle
,
for
it
be
unknown
how
much
he
have
cost
his
uncle
;
and
,
indeed
,
it
would
make
some
difference
in
_
her
_
present
too
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
glad
that
she
have
give
William
<EOS>
what
she
do
at
parting
,
very
glad
,
indeed
,
that
it
have
be
in
her
power
,
without
material
inconvenience
,
just
at
that
time
to
give
him
something
rather
considerable
;
that
is
,
for
_
her
_
,
with
_
her
_
limited
mean
<EOS>
,
for
now
it
would
all
be
useful
in
help
to
fit
up
his
cabin
.
<EOS>
She
know
he
must
be
at
some
expense
,
that
he
would
have
many
thing
to
buy
,
though
to
be
sure
his
father
and
mother
would
be
able
to
put
him
in
the
way
of
get
everything
very
cheap
;
but
she
be
very
glad
she
have
contribute
her
mite
towards
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
you
give
him
something
considerable
,
"
say
Lady
Bertram
,
with
most
unsuspicious
calmness
,
"
for
_
<EOS>
I
_
give
him
only
10
pound
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
indeed
!
"
cry
Mrs.
Norris
,
redden
.
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
he
must
have
go
off
with
his
pocket
well
line
,
and
at
no
expense
for
his
journey
to
London
either
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Thomas
tell
me
10
pound
would
be
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
,
be
not
at
all
incline
to
question
its
sufficiency
,
begin
to
take
the
matter
in
another
point
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
amazing
,
"
say
she
,
"
how
much
young
people
cost
their
friend
,
what
with
bring
them
up
and
put
them
out
in
the
world
!
<EOS>
They
little
think
how
much
it
come
to
,
or
what
their
parent
,
or
their
uncle
and
aunt
,
pay
for
them
in
the
course
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
now
,
here
be
my
sister
Price
's
child
;
take
them
all
together
,
I
dare
say
nobody
would
believe
what
a
sum
they
cost
Sir
Thomas
every
year
,
to
say
nothing
of
what
_
<EOS>
I
_
do
for
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
true
,
sister
,
as
you
say
.
<EOS>
but
,
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
they
can
not
help
it
;
and
you
know
it
make
very
little
difference
to
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
Fanny
,
William
must
not
forget
my
shawl
if
he
go
to
the
East
Indies
;
and
I
shall
give
him
a
commission
for
anything
else
that
be
worth
have

<EOS>
I
wish
he
may
go
to
the
East
Indies
,
that
I
may
have
my
shawl
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
will
have
two
shawl
,
Fanny

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
,
meanwhile
,
speak
only
when
she
could
not
help
it
,
be
very
earnestly
try
to
understand
what
Mr.
and
Miss
Crawford
be
at
.
<EOS>
there
be
everything
in
the
world
_
against
_
their
be
serious
but
his
word
and
manner
.
<EOS>
everything
natural
,
probable
,
reasonable
,
be
against
it
;
all
their
habit
and
way
of
thinking
,
and
all
her
own
demerit
.
<EOS>
how
could
_
she
_
have
excite
serious
attachment
in
a
man
who
have
see
so
many
,
and
be
admire
by
so
many
,
and
flirt
with
so
many
,
infinitely
her
superior
;
who
seem
so
little
open
to
serious
impression
,
even
where
pain
have
be
take
to
please
him
;
who
think
so
slightly
,
so
carelessly
,
so
unfeelingly
on
all
such
point
;
who
be
everything
to
everybody
,
and
seem
to
find
no
one
essential
to
him
?
<EOS>
and
farther
,
how
could
it
be
suppose
that
his
sister
,
with
all
her
high
and
worldly
notion
of
matrimony
,
would
be
forward
anything
of
a
serious
nature
in
such
a
quarter
?
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
unnatural
in
either
.
<EOS>
Fanny
be
ashamed
of
her
own
doubt
.
<EOS>
everything
may
be
possible
rather
than
serious
attachment
,
or
serious
approbation
of
it
toward
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
quite
convince
herself
of
this
before
Sir
Thomas
and
Mr.
Crawford
join
them
.
<EOS>
the
difficulty
be
in
maintain
the
conviction
quite
so
absolutely
after
Mr.
Crawford
be
in
the
room
;
for
once
or
twice
a
look
seem
force
on
her
which
she
do
not
know
how
to
class
among
the
common
meaning
;
in
any
other
man
,
at
least
,
she
would
have
say
that
it
mean
something
very
earnest
,
very
pointed
.
<EOS>
but
she
still
try
to
believe
it
no
more
than
what
he
may
often
have
express
towards
her
cousin
and
fifty
other
woman
.
  
<EOS>
She
think
he
be
wish
to
speak
to
her
unheard
by
the
rest
.
<EOS>
She
fancy
he
be
try
for
it
the
whole
evening
at
interval
,
whenever
Sir
Thomas
be
out
of
the
room
,
or
at
all
engage
with
Mrs.
Norris
,
and
she
carefully
refuse
him
every
opportunity
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
 
it
seem
an
at
last
to
Fanny
's
nervousness
,
though
not
remarkably
late
 
he
begin
to
talk
of
go
away
;
but
the
comfort
of
the
sound
be
impair
by
his
turning
to
her
the
next
moment
,
and
say
,
"
have
you
nothing
to
send
to
Mary
?
<EOS>
no
answer
to
her
note
?
<EOS>
She
will
be
disappoint
if
she
receive
nothing
from
you

<EOS>
pray
write
to
her

if
it
be
only
a
line

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
!
<EOS>
certainly
,
"
cry
Fanny
,
rise
in
haste
,
the
haste
of
embarrassment
and
of
want
to
get
away
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
write
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
go
accordingly
to
the
table
,
where
she
be
in
the
habit
of
write
for
her
aunt
,
and
prepare
her
material
without
know
what
in
the
world
to
say
.
<EOS>
She
have
read
Miss
Crawford
's
note
only
once
,
and
how
to
reply
to
anything
so
imperfectly
understand
be
most
distressing
.
<EOS>
quite
unpractised
in
such
sort
of
note
-
writing
,
have
there
be
time
for
scruple
and
fear
as
to
style
she
would
have
feel
them
in
abundance
:
but
something
must
be
instantly
write
;
and
with
only
one
decide
feeling
,
that
of
wish
not
to
appear
to
think
anything
really
intend
,
she
write
thus
,
in
great
tremble
both
of
spirit
and
hand
    
"
I
be
very
much
oblige
to
you

congratulation

far
as
they

the
rest
of
your
note
<EOS>
I
know
mean
nothing
;
but
I
be
so
unequal
to
anything
of
the
sort
,
that
I
hope
you
will
excuse
my
beg
you
to
take
no
farther
notice
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
too
much
of
Mr.
Crawford
not
to
understand
his
manner
;
if
he
understand
me
as
well
,
he
would
,
I
dare
say
,
behave
differently
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
I
write
,
but
it
would
be
a
great
favour
of
you
never
to
mention
the
subject
again
.
<EOS>
with
thank
for
the
honour
of
your
note
,
I
remain
,
dear
Miss
Crawford
,
etc
.
,
etc
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
conclusion
be
scarcely
intelligible
from
increase
fright
,
for
she
find
that
Mr.
Crawford
,
under
pretence
of
receive
the
note
,
be
come
towards
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
think
I
mean
to
hurry
you
,
"
say
he
,
in
an
undervoice
,
perceive
the
amazing
trepidation
with
which
she
make
up
the
note
<EOS>
,
"
you
can
not
think
I
have
any
such
object
.
<EOS>
do
not
hurry
yourself
,
I
entreat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
I
thank
you
;
I
have
quite
do
,
just
do
;
it
will
be
ready
in
a
moment
;
I
be
very
much
oblige
to
you
;
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
give
_
that
_
to
Miss
Crawford
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
note
be
hold
out
,
and
must
be
take
;
and
as
she
instantly
and
with
avert
eye
walk
towards
the
fireplace
,
where
sit
the
other
,
he
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
go
in
good
earnest
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
think
she
have
never
know
a
day
of
great
agitation
,
both
of
pain
and
pleasure
;
but
happily
the
pleasure
be
not
of
a
sort
to
die
with
the
day
;
for
every
day
would
restore
the
knowledge
of
William
's
advancement
,
whereas
the
pain
,
she
hope
,
would
return
no
more
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
doubt
that
her
note
must
appear
excessively
ill
-
write
,
that
the
language
would
disgrace
a
child
,
for
her
distress
have
allow
no
arrangement
;
but
at
least
it
would
assure
them
both
of
her
be
neither
impose
on
nor
gratify
by
Mr.
Crawford
's
attention
.
    
<EOS>
Fanny
have
by
no
mean
forget
Mr.
Crawford
when
she
awake
the
next
morning
;
but
she
remember
the
purport
of
her
note
,
and
be
not
less
sanguine
as
to
its
effect
than
she
have
be
the
night
before
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Crawford
would
but
go
away
!
<EOS>
that
be
what
she
most
earnestly
desire
:
go
and
take
his
sister
with
him
,
as
he
be
to
do
,
and
as
he
return
to
Mansfield
on
purpose
to
do
.
<EOS>
and
why
it
be
not
do
already
<EOS>
she
could
not
devise
,
for
Miss
Crawford
certainly
want
no
delay
.
<EOS>
Fanny
have
hope
,
in
the
course
of
his
yesterday
's
visit
,
to
hear
the
day
name
;
but
he
have
only
speak
of
their
journey
as
what
would
take
place
ere
long
.
  
<EOS>
have
so
satisfactorily
settle
the
conviction
her
note
would
convey
,
she
could
not
but
be
astonish
to
see
Mr.
Crawford
,
as
she
accidentally
do
,
come
up
to
the
house
again
,
and
at
an
hour
as
early
as
the
day
before
.
<EOS>
His
come
may
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
,
but
she
must
avoid
see
him
if
possible
;
and
be
then
on
her
way
upstairs
,
she
resolve
there
to
remain
,
during
the
whole
of
his
visit
,
unless
actually
send
for
;
and
as
Mrs.
Norris
be
still
in
the
house
,
there
seem
little
danger
of
her
be
want
.
  
<EOS>
She
sit
some
time
in
a
good
deal
of
agitation
,
listening
,
tremble
,
and
fear
to
be
send
for
every
moment
;
but
as
no
footstep
approach
the
East
room
,
she
grow
gradually
compose
,
could
sit
down
,
and
be
able
to
employ
herself
,
and
able
to
hope
that
Mr.
Crawford
have
come
and
would
go
without
her
be
oblige
to
know
anything
of
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
nearly
half
an
hour
have
pass
,
and
she
be
grow
very
comfortable
,
when
suddenly
the
sound
of
a
step
in
regular
approach
be
hear
;
a
heavy
step
,
an
unusual
step
in
that
part
of
the
house
:
it
be
her
uncle
's
;
she
know
it
as
well
as
his
voice
;
she
have
tremble
at
it
as
often
,
and
begin
to
tremble
again
,
at
the
idea
of
his
come
up
to
speak
to
her
,
whatever
may
be
the
subject
.
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
Sir
Thomas
who
open
the
door
and
ask
if
she
be
there
,
and
if
he
may
come
in
.
<EOS>
the
terror
of
his
former
occasional
visit
to
that
room
seem
all
renew
,
and
she
feel
as
if
he
be
go
to
examine
her
again
in
French
and
English
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
all
attention
,
however
,
in
place
a
chair
for
him
,
and
try
to
appear
honour
;
and
,
in
her
agitation
,
have
quite
overlook
the
deficiency
of
her
apartment
,
till
he
,
stop
short
as
he
enter
,
say
,
with
much
surprise
,
"
<EOS>
why
have
you
no
fire
to
-
day
?
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
snow
on
the
ground
,
and
she
be
sit
in
a
shawl
.
<EOS>
She
hesitate
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
cold
,
sir
:
<EOS>
I
never
sit
here
long
at
this
time
of
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
have
a
fire
in
general
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
come
this
about
?
<EOS>
here
must
be
some
mistake
.
<EOS>
I
understand
that
you
have
the
use
of
this
room
by
way
of
make
you
perfectly
comfortable
.
<EOS>
in
your
bedchamber
I
know
you
<EOS>
_
can
not
_
have
a
fire
.
<EOS>
here
be
some
great
misapprehension
which
must
be
rectify
.
<EOS>
It
be
highly
unfit
for
you
to
sit
,
be
it
only
half
an
hour
a
day
,
without
a
fire
.
<EOS>
You
be
not
strong
.
<EOS>
You
be
chilly
.
<EOS>
Your
aunt
can
not
be
aware
of
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
would
rather
have
be
silent
;
but
be
oblige
to
speak
,
she
could
not
forbear
,
in
justice
to
the
aunt
she
love
best
,
from
say
something
in
which
the
word
"
my
aunt
Norris
"
be
distinguishable
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
,
"
cry
her
uncle
,
recollect
himself
,
and
not
want
to
hear
more
:
"
I
understand
.
<EOS>
Your
aunt
Norris
have
always
be
an
advocate
,
and
very
judiciously
,
for
young
people
's
be
bring
up
without
unnecessary
indulgence
;
but
there
should
be
moderation
in
everything
.
<EOS>
She
be
also
very
hardy
herself
,
which
of
course
will
influence
her
in
her
opinion
of
the
want
of
other
.
<EOS>
and
on
another
account
,
too
,
I
can
perfectly
comprehend
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
her
sentiment
have
always
be
.
<EOS>
the
principle
be
good
in
itself
,
but
it
may
have
be
,
and
I
believe
_
have
<EOS>
_
_
be
_
,
carry
too
far
in
your
case
.
<EOS>
I
be
aware
that
there
have
be
sometimes
,
in
some
point
,
a
misplaced
distinction
;
but
I
think
too
well
of
you
,
Fanny
,
to
suppose
you
will
ever
harbour
resentment
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
You
have
an
understanding
which
will
prevent
you
from
receive
thing
only
in
part
,
and
judge
partially
by
the
event
.
<EOS>
You
will
take
in
the
whole
of
the
past
,
you
will
consider
time
,
person
,
and
probability
,
and
you
will
feel
that
_
they
_
be
not
least
your
friend
who
be
educate
and
prepare
you
for
that
mediocrity
of
condition
which
_
seem
_
to
be
your
lot
.
<EOS>
though
their
caution
may
prove
eventually
unnecessary
,
it
be
kindly
mean
;
and
of
this
you
may
be
assure
,
that
every
advantage
of
affluence
will
be
double
by
the
little
privation
and
restriction
that
may
have
be
impose
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
will
not
disappoint
my
opinion
of
you
,
by
fail
at
any
time
to
treat
your
aunt
Norris
with
the
respect
and
attention
that
be
due
to
her
.
<EOS>
but
enough
of
this
.
<EOS>
sit
down
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
I
must
speak
to
you
for
a
few
minute
,
but
I
will
not
detain
you
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
obey
,
with
eye
cast
down
and
colour
rise
.
<EOS>
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
Sir
Thomas
,
try
to
suppress
a
smile
,
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
aware
,
perhaps
,
that
I
have
have
a
visitor
this
morning
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
be
long
in
my
own
room
,
after
breakfast
,
when
Mr.
Crawford
be
shew
in
.
<EOS>
His
errand
you
may
probably
conjecture
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
's
colour
grow
deep
and
deep
;
and
her
uncle
,
perceive
that
she
be
embarrassed
to
a
degree
that
make
either
speak
or
look
up
quite
impossible
,
turn
away
his
own
eye
,
and
without
any
farther
pause
proceed
in
his
account
of
Mr.
Crawford
's
visit
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Crawford
's
business
have
be
to
declare
himself
the
lover
of
Fanny
,
make
decide
proposal
for
her
,
and
entreat
the
sanction
of
the
uncle
,
who
seem
to
stand
in
the
place
of
her
parent
;
and
he
have
do
it
all
so
well
,
so
openly
,
so
liberally
,
so
properly
,
that
Sir
Thomas
,
feeling
,
moreover
,
his
own
reply
,
and
his
own
remark
to
have
be
very
much
to
the
purpose
,
be
exceedingly
happy
to
give
the
particular
of
their
conversation
;
and
little
aware
of
what
be
pass
in
his
niece
's
mind
,
<EOS>
conceive
that
by
such
detail
he
must
be
gratify
her
far
more
than
himself
.
<EOS>
He
talk
,
therefore
,
for
several
minute
without
Fanny
's
daring
to
interrupt
him
.
<EOS>
She
have
hardly
even
attain
the
wish
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
be
in
too
much
confusion
.
<EOS>
She
have
change
her
position
;
and
,
with
her
eye
fix
intently
on
one
of
the
window
,
be
listen
to
her
uncle
in
the
utmost
perturbation
and
dismay
.
<EOS>
for
a
moment
he
cease
,
but
she
have
barely
become
conscious
of
it
,
<EOS>
when
,
rise
from
his
chair
,
he
say
,
"
<EOS>
and
now
,
Fanny
,
have
perform
one
part
of
my
commission

shew
you
everything
place
on
a
basis
the
most
assured

satisfactory

I
may
execute
the
remainder

prevail
on
you
to
accompany
me
downstairs

where
,
though
I
can

no

I
must
submit
to
your
finding
one
still
better
worth
listen
to

<EOS>
Mr.
Crawford
,
as
you
have
perhaps
foresee
,
be
yet
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
my
room
,
and
hope
to
see
you
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
look
,
a
start
,
an
exclamation
on
hear
this
,
which
astonish
Sir
Thomas
;
but
what
be
his
increase
of
astonishment
on
hear
her
exclaim
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
no
,
sir
,
I
can
not
,
indeed
I
can
not
go
down
to
him

<EOS>
Mr.
Crawford
ought
to
know
 
he
must
know
that
:
I
tell
him
enough
yesterday
to
convince
him
;
he
speak
to
me
on
this
subject
yesterday
,
and
I
tell
him
without
disguise
that
it
be
very
disagreeable
to
me
,
and
quite
out
of
my
power
to
return
his
good
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
catch
your
meaning
,
"
say
Sir
Thomas
,
sit
down
again
.
<EOS>
"
out
of
your
power
to
return
his
good
opinion
?
<EOS>
what
be
all
this
?
<EOS>
I
know
he
speak
to
you
yesterday
,
and
<EOS>
(
as
far
as
I
understand
)
receive
as
much
encouragement
to
proceed
as
a
well
-
judge
young
woman
could
permit
herself
to
give
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
pleased
with
what
I
collect
to
have
be
your
behaviour
on
the
occasion
;
it
shew
a
discretion
highly
to
be
commend
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
when
he
have
make
his
overture
so
properly
,
and
honourably
 
what
be
your
scruple
_
now
_
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
mistaken
,
sir
,
"
cry
Fanny
,
force
by
the
anxiety
of
the
moment
even
to
tell
her
uncle
that
he
be
wrong
;
"
you
be
quite
mistaken
.
<EOS>
how
could
Mr.
Crawford
say
such
a
thing
?
<EOS>
I
give
him
no
encouragement
yesterday
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
I
tell
him
,
I
can
not
recollect
my
exact
word
,
but
I
be
sure
I
tell
him
that
I
would
not
listen
to
him
,
that
it
be
very
unpleasant
to
me
in
every
respect
,
and
that
I
beg
him
never
to
talk
to
me
in
that
manner
again
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
say
as
much
as
that
and
more
;
and
I
should
have
say
still
more
,
if
I
have
be
quite
certain
of
his
meaning
anything
seriously
;
but
I
do
not
like
to
be
,
I
could
not
bear
to
be
,
impute
more
than
may
be
intend
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
may
all
pass
for
nothing
with
_
him
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
could
say
no
more
;
her
breath
be
almost
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
I
to
understand
,
"
say
Sir
Thomas
,
after
a
few
moment
'
silence
,
"
that
you
mean
to

I

well
enough
to

him

<EOS>
"
this
be
very
strange

Sir
Thomas
,
in
a
voice
of
calm
displeasure

"
there
be
something
in
this
which
my

here
be
a
young
man

to
pay
his
address
to
you

with
everything
to
recommend
him

not

situation
in
life

fortune

character

with
more

agreeableness

with
address

pleasing

do

that

for
your
brother

which
I
should
suppose
would
have
be
almost
sufficient
recommendation
to
you
,
have
there
be
no
other
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
uncertain
when
my
interest
may
have
get
William
on
.
<EOS>
He
have
do
it
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Fanny
,
in
a
faint
voice
,
and
look
down
with
fresh
shame
;
and
she
do
feel
almost
ashamed
of
herself
,
after
such
a
picture
as
her
uncle
have
draw
,
for
not
like
Mr.
Crawford
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
be
aware
,
"
continue
Sir
Thomas
presently
,
"
you
must
have
be
some
time
aware
of
a
particularity
in
Mr.
Crawford
's
manner
to
you
.
<EOS>
this
can
not
have
take
you
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
observe
his
attention
;
and
though
you
always
receive
them
very
properly
(
I
have
no
accusation
to
make
on
that
head
)
,
I
never
perceive
them
to
be
unpleasant
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
be
half
inclined
to
think
,
Fanny
,
that
you
do
not
quite
know
your
own
feeling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
,
sir
!
<EOS>
indeed
I
do

<EOS>
His
attention
be
always
 
what
I
do
not
like

<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
look
at
her
with
deep
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
beyond
me
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
require
explanation
.
<EOS>
young
as
you
be
,
and
have
see
scarcely
any
one
,
it
be
hardly
possible
that
your
affection
 
"
  
<EOS>
He
pause
and
eye
her
fixedly
.
<EOS>
He
see
her
lip
form
into
a
_
no
_
,
though
the
sound
be
inarticulate
,
but
her
face
be
like
scarlet
.
<EOS>
that
,
however
,
in
so
modest
a
girl
,
may
be
very
compatible
with
innocence
;
and
chuse
at
least
to
appear
satisfied
,
he
quickly
add
,
"
no
,
no
,
I
know
_
that
_
be
quite
out
of
the
question
;
quite
impossible

<EOS>
well
,
there
be
nothing
more
to
be
say

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
for
a
few
minute
he
do
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
be
deep
in
thought
.
<EOS>
His
niece
be
deep
in
thought
likewise
,
try
to
harden
and
prepare
herself
against
farther
questioning
.
<EOS>
She
would
rather
die
than
own
the
truth
;
and
she
hope
,
by
a
little
reflection
,
to
fortify
herself
beyond
betray
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
independently
of
the
interest
which
Mr.
Crawford
's
_
choice
_
seem
to
justify
"
say
Sir
Thomas
,
begin
again
,
and
very
composedly
,
"
his
wishing
to
marry
at
all
so
early
be
recommendatory
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
an
advocate
for
early
marriage
,
where
there
be
mean
in
proportion
,
and
would
have
every
young
man
,
with
a
sufficient
income
,
settle
as
soon
after
four
-
and
-
twenty
as
he
can
.
<EOS>
this
be
so
much
my
opinion
,
that
I
be
sorry
to
think
how
little
likely
my
own
eld
son
,
your
cousin
,
Mr.
Bertram
,
be
to
marry
early
;
but
at
present
,
as
far
as
I
can
judge
,
matrimony
make
no
part
of
his
plan
or
thought
.
<EOS>
I
wish
he
be
more
likely
to
fix
.
<EOS>
"
here
be
a
glance
at
Fanny
.
<EOS>
"
Edmund
,
I
consider
,
from
his
disposition
and
habit
,
as
much
more
likely
to
marry
early
than
his
brother
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
,
indeed
,
I
have
lately
think
,
have
see
the
woman
he
could
love
,
which
,
I
be
convinced
,
my
eld
son
have
not
.
<EOS>
be
I
right
?
<EOS>
do
you
agree
with
me
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
gently
,
but
it
be
calmly
say
,
and
Sir
Thomas
be
easy
on
the
score
of
the
cousin
.
<EOS>
but
the
removal
of
his
alarm
do
his
niece
<EOS>
no
service
<EOS>
:
as
her
unaccountableness
be
confirm
his
displeasure
increase
;
and
get
up
and
walk
about
the
room
with
a
frown
,
which
Fanny
could
picture
to
herself
,
though
she
dare
not
lift
up
her
eye
,
he
shortly
afterwards
,
and
in
a
voice
of
authority
,
say
,
"
have
you
any
reason
,
child
,
to
think
ill
of
Mr.
Crawford
's
temper
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
long
to
add
,
"
<EOS>
but
of
his
principle
I
have
"
;
but
her
heart
sink
under
the
appalling
prospect
of
discussion
,
explanation
,
and
probably
non
-
conviction
.
<EOS>
Her
ill
opinion
of
him
be
found
chiefly
on
observation
,
which
,
for
her
cousin
'
sake
,
she
could
scarcely
dare
mention
to
their
father
.
<EOS>
Maria
and
Julia
,
and
especially
Maria
,
be
so
closely
implicate
in
Mr.
Crawford
's
misconduct
,
that
she
could
not
give
his
character
,
such
as
she
believe
it
,
without
betray
them
.
<EOS>
She
have
hope
that
,
to
a
man
like
her
uncle
,
so
discerning
,
so
honourable
,
so
good
,
the
simple
acknowledgment
of
settle
_
dislike
_
on
her
side
would
have
be
sufficient
.
<EOS>
to
her
infinite
grief
she
find
it
be
not
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
come
towards
the
table
where
she
sit
in
tremble
wretchedness
,
and
with
a
good
deal
of
cold
sternness
,
say
,
"
It
be
of
no
use
,
I
perceive
,
to
talk
to
you
.
<EOS>
We
have
better
put
an
end
to
this
most
mortifying
conference
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Crawford
must
not
be
keep
longer
wait
.
<EOS>
I
will
,
therefore
,
only
add
,
as
think
it
my
duty
to
mark
my
opinion
of
your
conduct
,
that
you
have
disappoint
every
expectation
I
have
form
,
and
prove
yourself
of
a
character
the
very
reverse
of
what
I
have
suppose
.
<EOS>
for
I
_
have
_
,
Fanny
,
as
I
think
my
behaviour
must
have
shew
,
form
a
very
favourable
opinion
of
you
from
the
period
of
my
return
to
England
.
<EOS>
I
have
think
you
peculiarly
free
from
wilfulness
of
temper
,
self
-
conceit
,
and
every
tendency
to
that
independence
of
spirit
which
prevail
so
much
in
modern
day
,
even
in
young
woman
,
and
which
in
young
woman
be
offensive
and
disgusting
beyond
all
common
offence
.
<EOS>
but
you
have
now
shew
me
that
you
can
be
wilful
and
perverse
;
that
you
can
and
will
decide
for
yourself
,
without
any
consideration
or
deference
for
those
who
have
surely
some
right
to
guide
you
,
without
even
ask
their
advice
.
<EOS>
You
have
shew
yourself
very
,
very
different
from
anything
that
I
have
imagine
.
<EOS>
the
advantage
or
disadvantage
of
your
family
,
of
your
parent
,
your
brother
and
sister
,
never
seem
to
have
have
a
moment
's
share
in
your
thought
on
this
occasion

<EOS>
how
_
they
_
may
be
benefit
,
how
_
they
_
must
rejoice
in
such
an
establishment
for
you
,
be
nothing
to
_
you
_
.
<EOS>
You
think
only
of
yourself
,
and
because
you
do
not
feel
for
Mr.
Crawford
exactly
what
a
young
heated
fancy
imago
to
be
necessary
for
happiness
,
you
resolve
to
refuse
him
at
once
,
without
wish
even
for
a
little
time
to
consider
of
it
,
a
little
more
time
for
cool
consideration
,
and
for
really
examine
your
own
inclination
;
and
be
,
in
a
wild
fit
of
folly
,
throw
away
from
you
such
an
opportunity
of
be
settle
in
life
,
eligibly
,
honourably
,
nobly
settle
,
as
will
,
probably
,
never
occur
to
you
again

<EOS>
here
be
a
young
man
of
sense

of
character
,
of
temper
,
of
manner
,
and
of
fortune
,
exceedingly
attach
to
you
,
and
seek
your
hand
in
the
most
handsome
and
disintereste
way
;
and
let
me
tell
you
,
Fanny
,
that
you
may
live
eighteen
year
longer
in
the
world
without
be
address
by
a
man
of
half
Mr.

's
estate
,

a
tenth
part

gladly
would
I
have
bestow
either
of

daughter
on
him

<EOS>
Maria

nobly
married

have
Mr.
Crawford
seek
Julia
's
hand
,
I
should
have
give
it
to
him
with
superior
and
more
heartfelt
satisfaction
than
I
give
Maria
's
to
Mr.
Rushworth

<EOS>
after
half
a
moment
's
pause
:
"
and
I
should
have
be
very
much
surprised

either
of
my
daughter

on
receive
a
proposal
of
marriage
at
any
time

may

with
it
only

the
eligibility

peremptorily
,

without

my
opinion

compliment

put
a
decide
negative
on
it

<EOS>
I
should
have
be
much
surprised

much
hurt
by
such
a
proceeding

<EOS>
I
should
have
think
it
a
gross
violation
of
duty
and
respect

_
You
_
be
not
to
be
judge
by
the
same
rule

<EOS>
You
do
not
owe
me
the
duty
of
a
child

<EOS>
but
,
Fanny
,
if
your
heart
can
acquit
you

He
cease

<EOS>
Fanny
be
by
this
time
cry
so
bitterly
that

angry
as
he
be
,
he
would
not
press
that
article
farther

Her

almost
break
by
such
a
picture

by
such
accusation

so
heavy

so
multiplied

so
rise
in
dreadful
gradation

<EOS>
self

willed
,
obstinate
,
selfish
,
and
ungrateful

<EOS>
He
think
her
all
this
.
<EOS>
She
have
deceive
his
expectation
;
she
have
lose
his
good
opinion

<EOS>
what
be
to
become
of
her
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
sorry

she
inarticulately
,
through
her
tear
,
"
I
be
very
sorry
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
sorry
!
<EOS>
yes
,
I
hope
you
be
sorry
;
and
you
will
probably
have
reason
to
be
long
sorry
for
this
day
's
transaction

"
if
it
be
possible
for
me
to
do
<EOS>
otherwise

say
she

with
another
strong
effort
;
"
but
I
be
so
perfectly
convinced
that
I
could
never
make
him
happy

and
that
I
should
be
miserable
myself

"
  
<EOS>
another
burst
of
tear
;
but
in
spite
of
that
burst
,
and
in
spite
of
that
great
black
word
_
miserable
_
,
which
serve
to
introduce
it
,
Sir
Thomas
begin
to
think
a
little
relenting
,
a
little
change
of
inclination
,
may
have
something
to
do
with
it
;
and
to
augur
favourably
from
the
personal
entreaty
of
the
young
man
himself
.
<EOS>
He
know
her
to
be
very
timid
,
and
exceedingly
nervous
;
and
think
it
not
improbable
that
her
mind
may
be
in
such
a
state
as
a
little
time
,
a
little
pressing
,
a
little
patience
,
and
a
little
impatience
,
a
judicious
mixture
of
all
on
the
lover
's
side
,
may
work
their
usual
effect
on
.
<EOS>
if
the
gentleman
would
<EOS>
but
persevere
,
if
he
have
but
love
enough
to
persevere
,
Sir
Thomas
begin
to
have
hope
;
and
these
reflection
have
pass
across
his
mind
and
cheer
it
,
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
he
,
in
a
tone
of
become
gravity
,
but
of
less
anger
,
"
well
,
child
,
dry
up
your
tear

<EOS>
there
be
no
use
in
these
tear
;
they
can
do
no
good
.
<EOS>
You
must
now
come
downstairs
with
me
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Crawford
have
be
keep
wait
too
long
already
.
<EOS>
You
must
give
him
your
own
answer
<EOS>
:
we
can
not
expect
him
to
be
satisfied
with
less
;
and
you
only
can
explain
to
him
the
ground
of
that
misconception
of
your
sentiment
,
which
,
unfortunately
for
himself
,
he
certainly
have
imbibe
.
<EOS>
I
be
totally
unequal
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
Fanny
shew
such
reluctance
,
such
misery
,
at
the
idea
of
go
down
to
him
,
that
Sir
Thomas
,
after
a
little
consideration
,
judge
it
better
to
indulge
her
.
<EOS>
His
hope
from
both
gentleman
and
lady
suffer
a
small
depression
in
consequence
;
but
when
he
look
at
his
niece
,
and
see
the
state
of
feature
and
complexion
which
her
crying
have
bring
her
into
,
he
think
there
may
be
as
much
lose
as
gain
by
an
immediate
interview
.
<EOS>
with
a
few
word
,
therefore
,
of
no
particular
meaning
,
he
walk
off
by
himself
,
leave
his
poor
niece
to
sit
and
cry
over
what
have
pass
,
with
very
wretched
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
Her
mind
be
all
disorder
.
<EOS>
the
past
,
present
,
future
,
everything
be
terrible
.
<EOS>
but
her
uncle
's
anger
give
her
the
severe
pain
of
all
.
<EOS>
selfish
and
ungrateful
!
<EOS>
to
have
appear
so
to
him
!
<EOS>
She
be
miserable
for
ever
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
one
to
take
her
part
,
to
counsel
,
or
speak
for
her
.
<EOS>
Her
only
friend
be
absent
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
soften
his
father
;
but
all
,
perhaps
all
,
would
think
her
selfish
and
ungrateful
.
<EOS>
She
may
have
to
endure
the
reproach
again
and
again
;
she
may
hear
it
,
or
see
it
,
or
know
it
to
exist
for
ever
in
every
connexion
about
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
but
feel
some
resentment
against
Mr.
Crawford
;
yet
,
if
he
really
love
her
,
and
be
unhappy
too
!
<EOS>
It
be
all
wretchedness
together

<EOS>
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
her
uncle
return

she
be
almost
ready
to
faint
at
the
sight
of
him

He
speak
calmly

however

without
austerity
,
without
reproach

she
revive
a
little

there
be
comfort

too

it

it
can

that
he
should
request
to
speak
with
you
alone

it
only
for
five
minute

a
request
too
natural

a
claim

just

there
be
no

you

yourself

I
advise

to
go
out

the
air
will
do
you
good

go
out
for
an
hour
on
the
gravel

you
will
have
the

yourself

will
be
the

there

<EOS>
this
be
an

joyfully
obey

this
be
an
act
of
kindness

Fanny

at

to

spare
from
her
aunt
Norris
's
interminable
reproach

<EOS>
he
leave
her
in
a
glow
of
gratitude

<EOS>
anything
may
be
bearable
rather
than
such
reproach
.
<EOS>
even
to
see
Mr.
Crawford
would
be
less
overpowering
.
  
<EOS>
She
walk
out
directly
,
as
her
uncle
recommend
,
and
follow
his
advice
throughout
,
as
far
as
she
could
;
do
check
her
tear
;
do
earnestly
try
to
compose
her
spirit
and
strengthen
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
wish
to
prove
to
him
that
she
do
desire
his
comfort
,
and
seek
to
regain
his
favour
;
and
he
have
give
her
another
strong
motive
for
exertion
,
in
keep
the
whole
affair
from
the
knowledge
of
her
aunt
.
<EOS>
not
to
excite
suspicion
by
her
look
or
manner
be
now
an
object
worth
attaining
;
and
she
feel
equal
to
almost
anything
that
may
save
her
from
her
aunt
Norris
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
strike
,
quite
strike
,
when
,
on
return
from
her
walk
and
go
into
the
East
room
again
,
the
first
thing
which
catch
her
eye
be
a
fire
light
and
burn
.
<EOS>
a
fire
!
<EOS>
it
seem
too
much
;
just
at
that
time
to
be
give
her
such
an
indulgence
be
exciting
even
painful
gratitude
.
<EOS>
She
wonder
that
Sir
Thomas
could
have
leisure
to
think
of
such
a
trifle
again
;
but
she
soon
find
,
from
the
voluntary
information
of
the
housemaid
,
who
come
in
to
attend
it
,
that
so
it
be
to
be
every
day
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
have
give
order
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
be
a
brute
,
indeed
,
if
I
can
be
really
ungrateful
!
"
<EOS>
say
she
,
in
soliloquy

<EOS>
"
Heaven
defend
me
from
be
ungrateful
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
see
nothing
more
of
her
uncle
,
nor
of
her
aunt
Norris
,
till
they
meet
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
Her
uncle
's
behaviour
to
her
be
then
as
nearly
as
possible
what
it
have
be
before
;
she
be
sure
he
do
not
mean
there
should
be
any
change
,
and
that
it
be
only
her
own
conscience
that
could
fancy
any
;
but
her
aunt
be
soon
quarrel
with
her
;
and
when
she
find
how
much
and
how
unpleasantly
her
have
only
walk
out
without
her
aunt
's
knowledge
could
be
dwell
on
,
she
feel
all
the
reason
she
have
to
bless
the
kindness
which
save
her
from
the
same
spirit
of
reproach
,
exert
on
a
more
momentous
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
have
know
you
be
go
out
,
I
should
have
get
you
just
to
go
as
far

my
house
with
some
order
for
Nanny

"
say
she
,
"
which
I
have
since
,
to
my
very
great
inconvenience
,
be
oblige
to
go
and
carry
myself
.

I
could
very
ill
spare
the
time
,

you
may
have
save
me
the
trouble
,
if
you
would
only
have
be
so
good
as
to
let
us
know
you
be
go
out

It
would
have
make
no
difference
to
you
,
I
suppose
,
whether
you
have
walk
in
the
shrubbery
or
go
to
my
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
recommend
the
shrubbery
to
Fanny
as
the
dry
place
,
"
say
Sir
Thomas
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
say
Mrs.
Norris
,
with
a
moment
's
check
,
"
that
be
very
kind
of
you
,
Sir
Thomas

but
you
do
not
know
how
dry
the
path
be
to
my
house
.
<EOS>
Fanny
would
have
have
quite
as
good
a
walk
there
,
I
assure
you
,
with
the
advantage
of
be
of
some
use
,
and
oblige
her
aunt
:
it
be
all
her
fault
.
<EOS>
if
she
would
but
have
let
us
know
she
be
go
out
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
something
about
Fanny
<EOS>
,
I
have
often
observe
it
before
 
she
like
to
go
her
own
way
to
work
;
she
do
not
like
to
be
dictate
to
;
she
take
her
own
independent
walk
<EOS>
whenever
she
can
;
she
certainly
have
a
little
spirit
of
secrecy
,
and
independence
,
and
nonsense
,
about
her
,
which
I
would
advise
her
to
get
the
well
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
a
general
reflection
on
Fanny
,
Sir
Thomas
think
nothing
could
be
more
unjust
,
though
he
have
be
so
lately
express
the
same
sentiment
himself
,
and
he
try
to
turn
the
conversation
:
try
repeatedly
before
he
could
succeed
;
for
Mrs.
Norris
have
not
discernment
enough
to
perceive
,
either
now
,
or
at
any
other
time
,
to
what
degree
he
think
well
of
his
niece
,
or
how
very
far
he
be
from
wish
to
have
his
own
child
's
merit
set
off
by
the
depreciation
of
hers
.
<EOS>
She
be
talk
_
at
_
Fanny
,
and
resent
this
private
walk
half
through
the
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
over
,
however
,
at
last
;
and
the
evening
set
in
with
more
composure
to
Fanny
,
and
more
cheerfulness
of
spirit
than
she
could
have
hope
for
after
so
stormy
a
morning
;
but
she
trust
,
in
the
first
place
,
that
she
have
do
right
:
that
her
judgment
have
not
mislead
her
.
<EOS>
for
the
purity
of
her
intention
she
could
answer
;
and
she
be
willing
to
hope
,
secondly
,
that
her
uncle
's
displeasure
be
abate
,
and
would
abate
farther
as
he
consider
the
matter
with
more
impartiality
,
and
feel
,
as
a
good
man
must
feel
,
how
wretched
,
and
how
unpardonable
,
how
hopeless
,
and
how
wicked
it
be
to
marry
without
affection
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
meeting
with
which
she
be
threaten
for
the
morrow
be
past
,
she
could
not
but
flatter
herself
that
the
subject
would
be
finally
conclude
,
and
Mr.
Crawford
once
go
from
Mansfield
,
that
everything
would
soon
be
as
if
no
such
subject
have
exist
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
,
could
not
believe
,
that
Mr.
Crawford
's
affection
for
her
could
distress
him
long
;
his
mind
be
not
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
London
would
soon
bring
its
cure
.
<EOS>
in
London
he
would
soon
learn
to
wonder
at
his
infatuation
,
and
be
thankful
for
the
right
reason
in
her
which
have
save
him
from
its
evil
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
while
Fanny
's
mind
be
engage
in
these
sort
of
hope
,
her
uncle
be
,
soon
after
tea
,
call
out
of
the
room
;
an
occurrence
too
common
to
strike
her
,
and
she
think
nothing
of
it
till
the
butler
reappear
ten
minute
afterwards
,
and
advance
decidedly
towards
herself
,
say
,
"
Sir
Thomas
wish
to
speak
with
you
,
madam
,
in
his
own
room
.
"
<EOS>
then
it
occur
to
her
what
may
be
go
on
;
a
suspicion
rush
over
her
mind
which
drive
the
colour
from
her
cheek
;
but
instantly
rise
,
she
be
prepare
to
obey
,
when
Mrs.
Norris
call
out
,
"
stay
,
stay
,
Fanny
!
<EOS>
what
be
you
about
?
<EOS>
where
be
you
go
?
<EOS>
do
not
be
in
such
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
depend
upon
it
,
it
be
not
you
who
be
want
;
depend
upon
it
<EOS>
,
it
be
me
"
(
look
at
the
butler
)
;
"
but
you
be
so
very
eager
to
put
yourself
forward
.
<EOS>
what
should
Sir
Thomas
want
you
for
?
<EOS>
It
be
me
,
Baddeley
,
you
mean
;
I
be
come
this
moment
.
<EOS>
You
mean
me
,
Baddeley
,
I
be
sure
<EOS>
;
Sir
Thomas
want
me
,
not
Miss
Price
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
Baddeley
be
stout
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
madam
,
it
be
Miss
Price
;
I
be
certain
of
its
be
Miss
Price
.
"
<EOS>
and
there
be
a
half
-
smile
with
the
word
,
which
mean
,
"
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
you
would
answer
the
purpose
at
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
,
much
discontent
,
be
oblige
to
compose
herself
to
work
again
;
and
Fanny
,
walk
off
in
agitate
consciousness
,
find
herself
,
as
she
anticipate
,
in
another
minute
alone
with
Mr.
Crawford
.
    
<EOS>
the
conference
be
neither
so
short
nor
so
conclusive
as
the
lady
have
design
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
be
not
so
easily
satisfied
.
<EOS>
He
have
all
the
disposition
to
persevere
that
Sir
Thomas
could
wish
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
vanity
,
which
strongly
incline
him
in
the
first
place
to
think
she
do
love
him
,
though
she
may
not
know
it
herself
;
and
which
,
secondly
,
when
constrain
at
last
to
admit
that
she
do
know
her
own
present
feeling
,
convince
him
that
he
should
be
able
in
time
to
make
those
feeling
what
he
wish
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
in
love
,
very
much
in
love
;
and
it
be
a
love
which
,
operate
on
an
active
,
sanguine
spirit
,
of
more
warmth
than
delicacy
,
make
her
affection
appear
of
great
consequence
because
it
be
withhold
,
and
determine
him
to
have
the
glory
,
as
well
as
the
felicity
,
of
force
her
to
love
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
not
despair
:
he
would
not
desist
.
<EOS>
He
have
every
well
-
ground
reason
for
solid
attachment
;
he
know
her
to
have
all
the
worth
that
could
justify
the
warm
hope
of
last
happiness
with
her
;
her
conduct
at
this
very
time
,
by
speak
the
disinterestedness
and
delicacy
of
her
character
(
quality
which
he
believe
most
rare
indeed
)
,
be
of
a
sort
to
heighten
all
his
wish
,
and
confirm
all
his
resolution
.
<EOS>
He
know
not
that
he
have
a
pre
-
engaged
heart
to
attack
.
<EOS>
of
_
that
_
he
have
no
suspicion
.
<EOS>
He
consider
her
rather
as
one
who
have
never
think
on
the
subject
enough
to
be
in
danger
;
who
have
be
guard
by
youth
,
a
youth
of
mind
as
lovely
as
of
person
;
whose
modesty
have
prevent
her
from
understand
his
attention
,
and
who
be
still
overpower
by
the
suddenness
of
address
so
wholly
unexpected
,
and
the
novelty
of
a
situation
which
her
fancy
have
never
take
into
account
.
  
<EOS>
Must
it
not
follow
of
course
,
that
,
when
he
be
understand
,
he
should
succeed
?
<EOS>
He
believe
it
fully
.
<EOS>
love
such
as
his
,
in
a
man
like
himself
,
must
with
perseverance
secure
a
return
,
and
at
no
great
distance
;
and
he
have
so
much
delight
in
the
idea
of
oblige
her
to
love
him
in
a
very
short
time
,
that
her
not
love
him
now
be
scarcely
regret
.
<EOS>
a
little
difficulty
to
be
overcome
be
no
evil
to
Henry
Crawford
.
<EOS>
He
rather
derive
spirit
from
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
apt
to
gain
heart
too
easily
.
<EOS>
His
situation
be
new
and
animating
.
  
<EOS>
to
Fanny
,
however
,
who
have
know
too
much
opposition
all
her
life
to
find
any
charm
in
it
,
all
this
be
unintelligible
.
<EOS>
She
find
that
he
do
mean
to
persevere
;
but
how
he
could
,
after
such
language
from
her
as
she
feel
herself
oblige
to
use
,
be
not
to
be
understand
.
<EOS>
She
tell
him
that
she
do
not
love
him
,
could
not
love
him
,
be
sure
she
never
should
love
him
;
that
such
a
change
be
quite
impossible
;
that
the
subject
be
most
painful
to
her
;
that
she
must
entreat
him
never
to
mention
it
again
,
to
allow
her
to
leave
him
at
once
,
and
let
it
be
consider
as
conclude
for
ever
.
<EOS>
and
when
farther
pressed
,
have
add
,
that
in
her
opinion
their
disposition
be
so
totally
dissimilar
as
to
make
mutual
affection
incompatible
;
and
that
they
be
unfitted
for
each
other
by
nature
,
education
,
and
habit
.
<EOS>
all
this
she
have
say
,
and
with
the
earnestness
of
sincerity
;
yet
this
be
not
enough
,
for
he
immediately
deny
there
be
anything
uncongenial
in
their
character
,
or
anything
unfriendly
in
their
situation
;
and
positively
declare
,
that
he
would
still
love
,
and
still
hope
!
  
<EOS>
Fanny
know
her
own
meaning
,
but
be
no
judge
of
her
own
manner
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
be
incurably
gentle
;
and
she
be
not
aware
how
much
it
conceal
the
sternness
of
her
purpose
.
<EOS>
Her
diffidence
,
gratitude
,
and
softness
make
every
expression
of
indifference
seem
almost
an
effort
of
self
-
denial
;
seem
,
at
least
,
to
be
give
nearly
as
much
pain
to
herself
as
to
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Crawford
be
no
longer
the
Mr.
Crawford
who
,
as
the
clandestine
,
insidious
,
treacherous
admirer
of
Maria
Bertram
,
have
be
her
abhorrence
,
whom
she
have
hate
to
see
or
to
speak
to
,
in
whom
she
could
believe
no
good
quality
to
exist
,
and
whose
power
,
even
of
be
agreeable
,
she
have
barely
acknowledge
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
the
Mr.
Crawford
who
be
address
herself
with
ardent
,
disintereste
love
;
whose
feeling
be
apparently
become
all
that
be
honourable
and
upright
,
whose
view
of
happiness
be
all
fix
on
a
marriage
of
attachment
;
who
be
pour
out
his
sense
of
her
merit
,
describe
and
describe
again
his
affection
,
prove
as
far
as
word
could
prove
it
,
and
in
the
language
,
tone
,
and
spirit
of
a
man
of
talent
too
,
that
he

her
for
her
gentleness
and
her
goodness
;
and
to
complete
the
whole
,
he
be
now
the
Mr.
Crawford
who
have
procure
William
's
promotion
!
  
<EOS>
here
be
a
change
,
and
here
be
claim
which
could
not
but
operate
!
<EOS>
She
may
have
disdain
him
in
all
the
dignity
of
angry
virtue
,
in
the
ground
of
Sotherton
,
or
the
theatre
at
Mansfield
Park
;
but
he
approach
her
now
with
right
that
demand
different
treatment
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
courteous
,
and
she
must
be
compassionate
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
a
sensation
of
be
honour
,
and
whether
thinking
of
herself
or
her
brother
,
she
must
have
a
strong
feeling
of
gratitude
.
<EOS>
the
effect
of
the
whole
be
a
manner
so
pity
and
agitate
,
and
word
intermingle
with
her
refusal
so
expressive
of
obligation
and
concern
,
that
to
a
temper
of
vanity
and
hope
like
Crawford
's
,
the
truth
,
or
at
least
the
strength
of
her
indifference
,
may
well
be
questionable
;
and
he
be
not
so
irrational
as
Fanny
consider
him
,
in
the
profession
of
persevere
,
assiduous
,
and
not
despond
attachment
which
close
the
interview
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
with
reluctance
that
he
suffer
her
to
go
;
but
there
be
no
look
of
despair
in
part
to
belie
his
word
,
or
give
her
hope
of
his
be
less
unreasonable
than
he
profess
himself
.
  
<EOS>
now
she
be
angry
.
<EOS>
some
resentment
do
arise
at
a
perseverance
so
selfish
and
ungenerous
.
<EOS>
here
be
again
a
want
of
delicacy
and
regard
for
other
which
have
formerly
so
strike
and
disgust
her
.
<EOS>
here
be
again
a
something
of
the
same
Mr.
Crawford
whom
she
have
so
reprobate
before
.
<EOS>
how
evidently
be
there
a
gross
want
of
feeling
and
humanity
where
his
own
pleasure
be
concern
;
and
alas
!
<EOS>
how
always
know
no
principle
to
supply
as
a
duty
what
the
heart
be
deficient
in
!
<EOS>
have
her
own
affection
be
as
free
as
perhaps
they
ought
to
have
be
,
he
never
could
have
engage
them
.
  
<EOS>
so
think
Fanny
,
in
good
truth
and
sober
sadness
,
as
she
sit
muse
over
that
too
great
indulgence
and
luxury
of
a
fire
upstairs
:
wonder
at
the
past
and
present
;
wonder
at
what
be
yet
to
come
,
and
in
a
nervous
agitation
which
make
nothing
clear
to
her
<EOS>
but
the
persuasion
of
her
be
never
under
any
circumstance
able
to
love
Mr.
Crawford
,
and
the
felicity
of
have
a
fire
to
sit
over
and
think
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
be
oblige
,
or
oblige
himself
,
to
wait
till
the
morrow
for
a
knowledge
of
what
have
pass
between
the
young
people
.
<EOS>
He
then
see
Mr.
Crawford
,
and
receive
his
account
.
<EOS>
the
first
feeling
be
disappointment
:
he
have
hope
well
thing
;
he
have
think
that
an
hour
's
entreaty
from
a
young
man
like
Crawford
could
not
have
work
so
little
change
on
a
gentle
-
tempered
girl
like
Fanny
;
but
there
be
speedy
comfort
in
the
determined
view
and
sanguine
perseverance
of
the
lover
;
and
when
see
such
confidence
of
success
in
the
principal
,
Sir
Thomas
be
soon
able
to
depend
on
it
himself
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
be
omit
,
on
his
side
,
of
civility
,
compliment
,
or
kindness
,
that
may
assist
the
plan
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Crawford
's
steadiness
be
honour
,
and
Fanny
be
praise
,
and
the
connexion
be
still
the
most
desirable
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
at
Mansfield
Park
Mr.
Crawford
would
always
be
welcome
;
he
have
only
to
consult
his
own
judgment
and
feeling
as
to
the
frequency
of
his
visit
,
at
present
or
in
future
.
<EOS>
in
all
his
niece
's
family
and
friend
,
there
could
be
but
one
opinion
,
one
wish
on
the
subject
;
the
influence
of
all
who
love
her
must
incline
one
way
.
  
<EOS>
everything
be
say
that
could
encourage
,
every
encouragement
receive
with
grateful
joy
,
and
the
gentleman
part
the
good
of
friend
.
  
<EOS>
satisfied
that
the
cause
be
now
on
a
foot
the
most
proper
and
hopeful
,
Sir
Thomas
resolve
to
abstain
from
all
farth
importunity
with
his
niece
,
and
to
shew
no
open
interference
.
<EOS>
upon
her
disposition
he
believe
kindness
may
be
the
good
way
of
work
.
<EOS>
Entreaty
should
be
from
one
quarter
only
.
<EOS>
the
forbearance
of
her
family
on
a
point
,
respect
which
she
could
be
in
no
doubt
of
their
wish
,
may
be
their
sure
mean
of
forward
it
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
on
this
principle
,
Sir
Thomas
take
the
first
opportunity
of
say
to
her
,
with
a
mild
gravity
,
intend
to
be
overcome
,
"
well
,
Fanny
,
I
have
see
Mr.
Crawford
again
,
and
learn
from
him
exactly
how
matter
stand
between
you
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
most
extraordinary
young
man
,
and
whatever
be
the
event
,
you
must
feel
that
you
have
create
an
attachment
of
no
common
character
;
though
,
young
as
you
be
,
and
little
acquaint
with
the
transient
,
varying
,
unsteady
nature
of
love
,
as
it
generally
exist
,
you
can
not
be
strike
as
I
be
with
all
that
be
wonderful
in
a
perseverance
of
this
sort
against
discouragement
.
<EOS>
with
him
it
be
entirely
a
matter
of
feeling
:
he
claim
no
merit
in
it
;
perhaps
be
entitle
to
none
.
<EOS>
yet
,
have
choose
so
well
,
his
constancy
have
a
respectable
stamp
.
<EOS>
have
his
choice
be
less
unexceptionable
,
I
should
have
condemn
his
persevering
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
indeed
,
sir
,
"
say
Fanny
,
"
I
be
very
sorry
that
Mr.
Crawford
should
continue
to
know
that
it
be
pay
me
a
very
great
compliment
,
and
I
feel
most
undeservedly
honour
;
but
I
be
so
perfectly
convinced
,
and
I
have
tell
him
so
,
that
it
never
will
be
in
my
power
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
My
dear
,
"
interrupt
Sir
Thomas
,
"
there
be
no
occasion
for
this
.
<EOS>
Your
feeling
be
as
well
known
to
me
as
my
wish
and
regret
must
be
to
you
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
more
to
be
say
or
do
.
<EOS>
from
this
hour
the
subject
be
never
to
be
revive
between
us
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
nothing
to
fear
,
or
to
be
agitate
about
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
suppose
me
capable
of
try
to
persuade
you
to
marry
against
your
inclination
.
<EOS>
Your
happiness
and
advantage
be
all
that
I
have
in
view
,
and
nothing
be
require
of
you
but
to
bear
with
Mr.
Crawford
's
endeavour
to
convince
you
that
they
may
not
be
incompatible
with
his
.
<EOS>
He
proceed
at
his
own
risk
.
<EOS>
You
be
on
safe
ground
.
<EOS>
I
have
engage
for
your
see
him
whenever
he
call
,
as
you
may
have
do
have
nothing
of
this
sort
occur
.
<EOS>
You
will
see
him
with
the
rest
of
us
,
in
the
same
manner
,
and
,
as
much
as
you
can
,
dismiss
the
recollection
of
everything
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
He
leave
Northamptonshire
so
soon
,
that
even
this
slight
sacrifice
can
not
be
often
demand
.
<EOS>
the
future
must
be
very
uncertain
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
my
dear
Fanny
,
this
subject
be
closed
between
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
promise
departure
be
all
that
Fanny
could
think
of
with
much
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
Her
uncle
's
kind
expression
,
however
,
and
forbear
manner
,
be
sensibly
feel
;
and
when
she
consider
how
much
of
the
truth
be
unknown
to
him
,
she
believe
she
have
no
right
to
wonder
at
the
line
of
conduct
he
pursue
.
<EOS>
He
,
who
have
marry
a
daughter
to
Mr.
Rushworth
:
romantic
delicacy
be
certainly
not
to
be
expect
from
him
.
<EOS>
She
must
do
her
duty
,
and
trust
that
time
may
make
her
duty
easy
than
it
now
be
.
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
,
though
only
eighteen
,
suppose
Mr.
Crawford
's
attachment
would
hold
out
for
ever
;
she
could
not
but
imagine
that
steady
,
unceasing
discouragement
from
herself
would
put
an
end
to
it
in
time
.
<EOS>
how
much
time
she
may
,
in
her
own
fancy
,
allot
for
its
dominion
,
be
another
concern
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
fair
to
inquire
into
a
young
lady
's
exact
estimate
of
her
own
perfection
.
  
<EOS>
in
spite
of
his
intend
silence
,
Sir
Thomas
find
himself
once
more
oblige
to
mention
the
subject
to
his
niece
,
to
prepare
her
briefly
for
its
be
impart
to
her
aunt
;
a
measure
which
he
would
still
have
avoid
,
if
possible
,
but
which
become
necessary
from
the
totally
opposite
feeling
of
Mr.
Crawford
as
to
any
secrecy
of
proceeding
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
idea
of
concealment
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
know
at
the
Parsonage
,
where
he
love
to
talk
over
the
future
with
both
his
sister
,
and
it
would
be
rather
gratify
to
him
to
have
enlighten
witness
of
the
progress
of
his
success
.
<EOS>
when
Sir
Thomas
understand
this
,
he
feel
the
necessity
of
make
his
own
wife
and
sister
-
in
-
law
acquaint
with
the
business
without
delay
;
though
,
on
Fanny
's
account
,
he
almost
dread
the
effect
of
the
communication
to
Mrs.
Norris
as
much
as
Fanny
herself
.
<EOS>
He
deprecate
her
mistaken
but
well
-
mean
zeal
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
,
indeed
,
be
,
by
this
time
,
not
very
far
from
class
Mrs.
Norris
as
one
of
those
well
-
mean
people
who
be
always
do
mistaken
and
very
disagreeable
thing
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
,
however
,
relieve
him
.
<EOS>
He
press
for
the
strict
forbearance
and
silence
towards
their
niece
;
she
not
only
promise
,
but
do
observe
it
.
<EOS>
She
only
look
her
increase
ill
-
will
.
<EOS>
angry
she
be
:
bitterly
angry
;
but
she
be
more
angry
with
Fanny
for
have
receive
such
an
offer
than
for
refuse
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
injury
and
affront
to
Julia
,
who
ought
to
have
be
Mr.
Crawford
's
choice
;
and
,
independently
of
that
,
she
dislike
Fanny
,
because
she
have
neglect
her
;
and
she
would
have
grudge
such
an
elevation
to
one
whom
she
have
be
always
try
to
depress
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
give
her
more
credit
for
discretion
on
the
occasion
than
she
deserve
;
and
Fanny
could
have
bless
her
for
allow
her
only
to
see
her
displeasure
,
and
not
to
hear
it
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Bertram
take
it
differently
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
a
beauty
,
and
a
prosperous
beauty
,
all
her
life
;
and
beauty
and
wealth
be
all
that
excite
her
respect
.
<EOS>
to
know
Fanny
to
be
seek
in
marriage
by
a
man
of
fortune
,
raise
her
,
therefore
,
very
much
in
her
opinion
.
<EOS>
by
convince
her
that
Fanny
_
be
_
very
pretty
,
which
she
have
be
doubt
about
before
,
and
that
she
would
be
advantageously
married
,
it
make
her
feel
a
sort
of
credit
in
call
her
niece
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Fanny
,
"
say
she
,
as
soon
as
they
be
alone
together
afterwards
,
and
she
really
have
know
something
like
impatience
to
be
alone
with
her
,
and
her
countenance
,
as
she
speak
,
have
extraordinary
animation
;
"
well
,
Fanny
,
I
have
have
a
very
agreeable
surprise
this
morning
.
<EOS>
I
must
just
speak
of
it
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
once
_
,
I
tell
Sir
Thomas
<EOS>
I
must
<EOS>
_
once
<EOS>
_
,
and
then
I
shall
have
do
.
<EOS>
I
give
you
joy
,
my
dear
niece
.
"
<EOS>
and
look
at
her
complacently
,
she
add
,
"
Humph
,
we
certainly
be
a
handsome
family
!
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
coloured
,
and
doubt
at
first
what
to
say
;
when
,
hope
to
assail
her
on
her
vulnerable
side
,
she
presently
answer
    
"
<EOS>
My
dear
aunt
,
_
you
_
can
not
wish
me
to
do
differently
from
what
I
have
do
,
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
can
not
wish
me
to
marry
;
for
you
would
miss
me
,
should
not
you
?
<EOS>
yes
,
I
be
sure
you
would
miss
me
too
much
for
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
my
dear
,
I
should
not
think
of
miss
you
,
when
such
an
offer
as
this
come
in
your
way
.
<EOS>
I
could
do
very
well
without
you
,
if
you
be
marry
to
a
man
of
such
good
estate
as
Mr.
Crawford
.
<EOS>
and
you
must
be
aware
,
Fanny
,
that
it
be
every
young
woman
's
duty
to
accept
such
a
very
unexceptionable
offer
as
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
almost
the
only
rule
of
conduct
,
the
only
piece
of
advice
,
which
Fanny
have
ever
receive
from
her
aunt
in
the
course
of
eight
year
and
a
half
.
<EOS>
It
silence
her
.
<EOS>
She
feel
how
unprofitable
contention
would
be
.
<EOS>
if
her
aunt
's
feeling
be
against
her
,
nothing
could
be
hope
from
attack
her
understanding
.
<EOS>
Lady
Bertram
be
quite
talkative
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
,
Fanny
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
be
sure
he
fall
in
love
with
you
at
the
ball
;
I
be
sure
the
mischief
be
do
that
evening
.
<EOS>
You
do
look
remarkably
well
.
<EOS>
everybody
say
so
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
say
so
.
<EOS>
and
you
know
you
have
Chapman
to
help
you
to
dress
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
glad
I
send
Chapman
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
shall
tell
Sir
Thomas
that
I
be
sure
it
be
do
that
evening
.
"
<EOS>
and
still
pursue
the
same
cheerful
thought
,
she
soon
afterwards
add
,
"
and
will
tell
you
what
,
Fanny
,
which
be
more
than
I
do
for
Maria
:
the
next
time
Pug
have
a
litter
you
shall
have
a
puppy

"
    
<EOS>
Edmund
have
great
thing
to
hear
on
his
return
.
<EOS>
many
surprise
be
await
him
.
<EOS>
the
first
that
occur
be
not
least
in
interest
:
the
appearance
of
Henry
Crawford
and
his
sister
walk
together
through
the
village
as
he
ride
into
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
conclude
 
he
have
mean
them
to
be
far
distant
.
<EOS>
His
absence
have
be
extend
beyond
a
fortnight
purposely
to
avoid
Miss
Crawford
.
<EOS>
He
be
return
to
Mansfield
with
spirit
ready
to
feed
on
melancholy
remembrance
,
and
tender
association
,
when
her
own
fair
self
be
before
him
,
lean
on
her
brother
's
arm
,
and
he
find
himself
receive
a
welcome
,
unquestionably
friendly
,
from
the
woman
whom
,
two
moment
before
,
he
have
be
think
of
as
seventy
mile
off
,
and
as
farther
,
much
farther
,
from
him
in
inclination
than
any
distance
could
express
.
  
<EOS>
Her
reception
of
him
be
of
a
sort
which
he
could
not
have
hope
for
,
have
he
expect
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
come
as
he
do
from
such
a
purport
fulfil
as
have
take
him
away
,
he
would
have
expect
anything
rather
than
a
look
of
satisfaction
,
and
word
of
simple
,
pleasant
meaning
.
<EOS>
It
be
enough
to
set
his
heart
in
a
glow
,
and
to
bring
him
home
in
the
proper
state
for
feel
the
full
value
of
the
other
joyful
surprise
at
hand
.
  
<EOS>
William
's
promotion
,
with
all
its
particular
<EOS>
,
he
be
soon
master
of
;
and
with
such
a
secret
provision
of
comfort
within
his
own
breast
to
help
the
joy
,
he
find
in
it
a
source
of
most
gratify
sensation
and
unvarying
cheerfulness
all
dinner
-
time
.
  
<EOS>
after
dinner
,
when
he
and
his
father
be
alone
,
he
have
Fanny
's
history
;
and
then
all
the
great
event
of
the
last
fortnight
,
and
the
present
situation
of
matter
at
Mansfield
be
know
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
suspect
what
be
go
on
.
<EOS>
They
sit
so
much
long
than
usual
in
the
dining
-
parlour
,
that
she
be
sure
they
must
be
talk
of
her
;
and
when
tea
at
last
bring
them
away
,
and
she
be
to
be
see
by
Edmund
again
,
she
feel
dreadfully
guilty
.
<EOS>
He
come
to
her
,
sit
down
by
her
,
take
her
hand
,
and
press
it
kindly
;
and
at
that
moment
she
think
that
,
but
for
the
occupation
and
the
scene
which
the
tea
-
thing
afford
,
she
must
have
betray
her
emotion
in
some
unpardonable
excess
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
not
intend
,
however
,
by
such
action
,
to
be
convey
to
her
that
unqualified
approbation
and
encouragement
which
her
hope
draw
from
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
design
only
to
express
his
participation
in
all
that
interest
her
,
and
to
tell
her
that
he
have
be
hear
what
quicken
every
feeling
of
affection
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
in
fact
,
entirely
on
his
father
's
side
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
His
surprise
be
not
so
great
as
his
father
be
at
her
refuse
Crawford
,
because
,
so
far
from
suppose
her
to
consider
him
with
anything
like
a
preference
,
he
have
always
believe
it
to
be
rather
the
reverse
,
and
could
imagine
her
to
be
take
perfectly
unprepared
,
but
Sir
Thomas
could
not
regard
the
connexion
as
more
desirable
than
he
do
.
<EOS>
It
have
every
recommendation
to
him
;
and
while
honour
her
for
what
she
have
do
under
the
influence
of
her
present
indifference
,
honour
her
in
rather
strong
term
than
Sir
Thomas
could
quite
echo
,
he
be
most
earnest
in
hope
,
and
sanguine
in
believing
,
that
it
would
be
a
match
at
last
,
and
that
,
unite
by
mutual
affection
,
it
would
appear
that
their
disposition
be
as
exactly
fit
to
make
them
bless
in
each
other
,
as
he
be
now
begin
seriously
to
consider
them
.
<EOS>
Crawford
have
be
too
precipitate
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
give
her
time
to
attach
herself
.
<EOS>
He
have
begin
at
the
wrong
end
.
<EOS>
with
such
power
as
his
,
however
,
and
such
a
disposition
as
her
,
Edmund
trust
that
everything
would
work
out
a
happy
conclusion
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
he
see
enough
of
Fanny
's
embarrassment
to
make
him
scrupulously
guard
against
excite
it
a
second
time
,
by
any
word
,
or
look
,
or
movement
.
  
<EOS>
Crawford
call
the
next
day
,
and
on
the
score
of
Edmund
's
return
,
Sir
Thomas
feel
himself
more
than
licensed
to
ask
him
to
stay
dinner
;
it
be
really
a
necessary
compliment
.
<EOS>
He
staid
of
course
,
and
Edmund
have
then
ample
opportunity
for
observe
how
he
speed
with
Fanny
,
and
what
degree
of
immediate
encouragement
for
him
may
be
extract
from
her
manner
;
and
it
be
so
little
,
so
<EOS>
very
,
very
little
 
<EOS>
every
chance
,
every
possibility
of
it
,
rest
upon
her
embarrassment
only
<EOS>
;
if
there
be
not
hope
in
her
confusion
,
there
be
hope
in
nothing
else
 
that
he
be
almost
ready
to
wonder
at
his
friend
's
perseverance
.
<EOS>
Fanny
be
worth
it
all
;
he
hold
her
to
be
worth
every
effort
of
patience
,
every
exertion
of
mind
,
but
he
do
not
think
he
could
have
go
on
himself
with
any
woman
breathe
,
without
something
more
to
warm
his
courage
than
his
eye
could
discern
in
her
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
willing
to
hope
that
Crawford
see
clear
,
and
this
be
the
most
comfortable
conclusion
for
his
friend
that
he
could
come
to
from
all
that
he
observe
to
pass
before
,
and
at
,
and
after
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
evening
a
few
circumstance
occur
which
he
think
more
promising
.
<EOS>
when
he
and
Crawford
walk
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
his
mother
and
Fanny
be
sit
as
intently
and
silently
at
work
as
if
there
be
nothing
else
to
care
for
.
<EOS>
Edmund
could
not
help
notice
their
apparently
deep
tranquillity
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
not
be
so
silent
all
the
time
,
"
reply
his
mother
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Fanny
have
be
read
to
me
,
and
only
put
the
book
down
upon
hear
you
come
.
"
<EOS>
and
sure
enough
there
be
a
book
on
the
table
which
have
the
air
of
be
very
recently
close
:
a
volume
of
Shakespeare
.
<EOS>
"
She
often
read
to
me
out
of
those
book
;
and
she
be
in
the
middle
of
a
very
fine
speech
of
that
man
's
 
<EOS>
what
be
his
name
,
Fanny
?
 
<EOS>
when
we
hear
your
footstep
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Crawford
take
the
volume
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
let
me
have
the
pleasure
of
finish
that
speech
to
your
ladyship
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
find
it
immediately
.
"
<EOS>
and
by
carefully
give
way
to
the
inclination
of
the
leave
,
he
do
find
it
,
or
within
a
page
or
two
,
quite
near
enough
to
satisfy
Lady
Bertram
,
who
assure
him
,
as
soon
as
he
mention
the
name
of
Cardinal
Wolsey
,
that
he
have
get
the
very
speech
.
<EOS>
not
a
look
or
an
offer
of
help
have
Fanny
give
;
not
a
syllable
for
or
against
.
<EOS>
all
her
attention
be
for
her
work
.
<EOS>
She
seem
determined
to
be
interested
by
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
but
taste
be
too
strong
in
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
abstract
her
mind
five
minute
:
she
be
force
to
listen
;
his
reading
be
capital
,
and
her
pleasure
in
good
reading
extreme
.
<EOS>
to
_
good
_
reading
,
however
,
she
have
be
long
use
:
her
uncle
read
well
,
her
cousin
all
,
Edmund
very
well
,
but
in
Mr.
Crawford
's
reading
there
be
a
variety
of
excellence
beyond
what
she
have
ever
meet
with
.
<EOS>
the
King
,
the
Queen
,
Buckingham
,
Wolsey
,
Cromwell
,
all
be
give
in
turn
;
for
with
the
happy
knack
,
the
happy
power
of
jump
and
guess
,
he
could
always
alight
at
will
on
the
good
scene
,
or
the
good
speech
of
each
;
and
whether
it
be
dignity
,
or
pride
,
or
tenderness
,
or
remorse
,
or
whatever
be
to
be
express
,
he
could
do
it
with
equal
beauty
.
<EOS>
It
be
truly
dramatic
.
<EOS>
His
acting
have
first
teach
Fanny
what
pleasure
a
play
may
give
,
and
his
reading
bring
all
his
acting
before
her
again
;
nay
,
perhaps
with
great
enjoyment
,
for
it
come
unexpectedly
,
and
with
no
such
drawback
as
she
have
be
use
to
suffer
in
see
him
on
the
stage
with
Miss
Bertram
.
  
<EOS>
Edmund
watch
the
progress
of
her
attention
,
and
be
amuse
and
gratify
by
see
how
she
gradually
slacken
in
the
needlework
,
which
at
the
beginning
seem
to
occupy
her
totally
:
how
it
fall
from
her
hand
while
she
sit
motionless
over
it
,
and
at
last
,
how
the
eye
which
have
appear
so
studiously
to
avoid
him
throughout
the
day
be
turn
and
fix
on
Crawford
 
<EOS>
fix
on
him
for
minute
,
fix
on
him
,
in
short
,
till
the
attraction
draw
Crawford
's
upon
her
,
and
the
book
be
closed
,
and
the
charm
be
break
.
<EOS>
then
she
be
shrink
again
into
herself
,
and
blush
and
work
as
hard
as
ever
;
but
it
have
be
enough
to
give
Edmund
encouragement
for
his
friend
,
and
as
he
cordially
thank
him
,
he
hope
to
be
express
Fanny
's
secret
feeling
too
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
play
must
be
a
favourite
with
you
,
"
say
he
;
"
you
read
as
if
you
know
it
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
a
favourite
,
I
believe
,
from
this
hour
,
"
reply
Crawford
;
"
but
I
do
not
think
I
have
have
a
volume
of
Shakespeare
in
my
hand
before
since
I
be
fifteen
.
<EOS>
I
once
see
Henry
the
Eighth
act
,
or
I
have
hear
of
it
from
somebody
who
do
,
I
be
not
certain
which
.
<EOS>
but
Shakespeare
one
get
acquaint
with
without
know
how
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
part
of
an
Englishman
's
constitution
.
<EOS>
His
thought
and
beauty
be
so
spread
abroad
that
one
touch
them
everywhere
;
one
be
intimate
with
him
by
instinct
.
<EOS>
no
man
of
any
brain
can
open
at
a
good
part
of
one
of
his
play
without
fall
into
the
flow
of
his
meaning
immediately
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
doubt
one
be
familiar
with
Shakespeare
in
a
degree
,
"
say
Edmund
,
"
from
one
's
early
year
.
<EOS>
His
celebrated
passage
be
quote
by
everybody
;
they
be
in
half
the
book
we
open
,
and
we
all
talk
Shakespeare
,
use
his
simile
,
and
describe
with
his
description
;
but
this
be
totally
distinct
from
give
his
sense
as
you
give
it
.
<EOS>
to
know
him
in
bit
and
scrap
be
common
enough
;
to
know
him
pretty
thoroughly
be
,
perhaps
,
not
uncommon
;
but
to
read
him
well
<EOS>
aloud
be
no
everyday
talent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
you
do
me
honour
,
"
be
Crawford
's
answer
,
with
a
bow
of
mock
gravity
.
  
<EOS>
both
gentleman
have
a
glance
at
Fanny
,
to
see
if
a
word
of
accordant
praise
could
be
extort
from
her
;
yet
<EOS>
both
feeling
that
it
could
not
be
.
<EOS>
Her
praise
have
be
give
in
her
attention
;
_
that
_
must
content
them
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Bertram
's
admiration
be
express
,
and
strongly
too
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
really
like
be
at
a
play
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
Sir
Thomas
have
be
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
Crawford
be
excessively
pleased
.
<EOS>
if
Lady
Bertram
,
with
all
her
incompetency
and
languor
,
could
feel
this
,
the
inference
of
what
her
niece
,
alive
and
enlighten
as
she
be
,
must
feel
,
be
elevate
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
great
turn
for
acting
,
I
be
sure
,
Mr.
Crawford
,
"
say
her
ladyship
soon
afterwards
;
"
and
I
will
tell
you
what
,
I
think
you
will
have
a
theatre
,
some
time
or
other
,
at
your
house
in
Norfolk
.
<EOS>
I
mean
when
you
be
settle
there
.
<EOS>
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
will
fit
up
a
theatre
at
your
house
in
Norfolk
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
you
,
madam
?
"
cry
he
,
with
quickness
.
"
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
that
will
never
be
.
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
be
quite
mistaken
.
<EOS>
no
theatre
at
Everingham
!
<EOS>
oh
no
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
look
at
Fanny
with
an
expressive
smile
,
which
evidently
mean
,
"
that
lady
will
never
allow
a
theatre
at
Everingham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Edmund
see
it
all
,
and
see
Fanny
so
determined
_
not
_
to
see
it
,
as
to
make
it
clear
that
the
voice
be
enough
to
convey
the
full
meaning
of
the
protestation
;
and
such
a
quick
consciousness
of
compliment
,
such
a
ready
comprehension
of
a
hint
,
he
think
,
be
rather
favourable
than
not
.
  
<EOS>
the
subject
of
reading
aloud
be
farther
discuss
.
<EOS>
the
two
young
man
be
the
only
talker
,
but
they
,
stand
by
the
fire
,
talk
over
the
too
common
neglect
of
the
qualification
,
the
total
inattention
to
it
,
in
the
ordinary
school
-
system
for
boy
,
the
consequently
natural
,
yet
in
some
instance
almost
unnatural
,
degree
of
ignorance
and
uncouthness
of
man
,
of
sensible
and
well
-
inform
man
,
when
suddenly
call
to
the
necessity
of
read
aloud
,
which
have
fall
within
their
notice
,
give
instance
of
blunder
,
and
failure
with
their
secondary
cause
,
the
want
of
management
of
the
voice
,
of
proper
modulation
and
emphasis
,
of
foresight
and
judgment
,
all
proceed
from
the
first
cause
:
want
of
early
attention
and
habit
;
and
Fanny
be
listen
again
with
great
entertainment
.
  
<EOS>
"
even
in
my
profession
,
"
say
Edmund
,
with
a
smile
,
"
how
little
the
art
of
reading
have
be
study
!
<EOS>
how
little
a
clear
manner
,
and
good
delivery
,
have
be
attend
to
!
<EOS>
I
speak
rather
of
the
past
,
however
,
than
the
present
.
<EOS>
there
be
now
a
spirit
of
improvement
abroad
;
but
among
those
who
be
ordain
twenty
,
thirty
,
forty
year
ago
,
the
large
number
,
to
judge
by
their
performance
,
must
have
think
reading
be
read
,
and
preaching
be
preach
.
<EOS>
It
be
different
now
.
<EOS>
the
subject
be
more
justly
consider
.
<EOS>
It
be
feel
that
distinctness
and
energy
may
have
weight
in
recommend
the
most
solid
truth
;
and
besides
,
there
be
more
general
observation
and
taste
,
a
more
critical
knowledge
diffuse
than
formerly
;
in
every
congregation
there
be
a
large
proportion
who
know
a
little
of
the
matter
,
and
who
can
judge
and
criticise
.
"
  
<EOS>
Edmund
have
already
go
through
the
service
once
since
his
ordination
;
and
upon
this
be
understand
,
he
have
a
variety
of
question
from
Crawford
as
to
his
feeling
and
success
;
question
,
which
be
make
,
though
with
the
vivacity
of
friendly
interest
and
quick
taste
,
without
any
touch
of
that
spirit
of
banter
or
air
of
levity
which
Edmund
know
to
be
most
offensive
to
Fanny
,
he
have
true
pleasure
in
satisfying
;
and
when
Crawford
proceed
to
ask
his
opinion
and
give
his
own
as
to
the
proper

<EOS>
this
would
be
the

to
Fanny

She
be
not

by
all
that
gallantry
and
wit

good

nature
together
could
do

,
at

,
she
would
not

win
by
them
nearly
so
soon

without
the

"
Our

Crawford

have
beauty

not

a

at

that
nineteen
time
out

I
be
think
how
such
a
prayer
ought
to
be
read
,
and
longing
to
have
it
to
read
myself
.
<EOS>
do
you
speak
?
"
<EOS>
step
eagerly
to
Fanny
,
and
address
her
in
a
softened
voice
;
and
upon
her
say
"
no
,
"
he
add
,
"
be
you
sure
you
do
not
speak

<EOS>
I
see
your
lip
move

I
fancy
you
may
be
go
to

me
I
ought
to
be
more
attentive

not

my

to

<EOS>
be
not
you
go
to
tell
me
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

indeed

you

your

<EOS>
She
stopt
,
feel
herself
get
into
a
puzzle
,
and
could
not
be
prevail
on
to
add
another
word
,
not
by
dint
of
several
minute
of
supplication
and
waiting
.
<EOS>
He
then
return
to
his
former
station

go
on
as
if
there
have
be
no
such
tender
interruption

<EOS>
"
a
sermon

well
deliver

more
uncommon

<EOS>
a
sermon

no

It

never

a

really
eloquence

the

can

affect
such
an
heterogeneous
mass
of
hearer

on
subject
limit

long
worn
threadbare
in

who
can

anything
new

striking

anything
that
rouse
the
attention
without
offend
the
taste

wear
out

well

unsteady

have
some
touch

away

though
on

rather
a

her

should
never

induce

what

day

early
day

actually
fix

departure

Sir
Thomas
think
it
may
be
as
well
to
make
one
more
effort
for
the
young
man
before
he
leave
Mansfield
,
that
all
his
profession

unshaken
attachment

have
as
much
hope

point

wish
him
to
be
a
model

the
good

effect
it
would

not
try
him
too
long

<EOS>
Edmund
be
not
unwilling
to
be
persuade
to
engage
in
the
business

he
want
to
know
Fanny
's
feeling

<EOS>
She
have
be
use
to
consult
him
in
every
difficulty

he
love
her

deny

hope
to

of
service

Fanny

an
unnatural

Fanny

at

agitated

deject

not

of

no

think
it

be
a
relief

<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
we
think
too
differently
for
me
to
find
any
relief
in
talking
of
what
I
feel

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
suppose
that
we
think
differently

<EOS>
I
have
no
idea

I
dare
say
that
,
on
a
comparison
of
our
opinion
,
they
would
be
find
as
much
alike
as
they
have
be
use
to
be
:
to
the
point
 
I
consider
Crawford
's
proposal
as
most
advantageous
and
desirable
,
if
you
could
return
his
affection
.
<EOS>
I
consider
it
as
most
natural
that
all
your
family
should
wish
you
could
return
it
;
but
that
,
as
you
can
not
,
you
have
do
exactly
as
you
ought
in
refuse
him
.
<EOS>
Can
there
be
any
disagreement
between
us
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
no
!
<EOS>
but
I
think
you
blame
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
be
against
me

<EOS>
this
be
such
a
comfort
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
comfort
you
may
have
have
sooner
,
Fanny
,
have
you
seek
it
.
<EOS>
but
how
could
you
possibly
suppose
me
against
you
?
<EOS>
how
could
you
imagine
me
an
advocate
for
marriage
without
love
?
<EOS>
be
I
even
careless
in
general
on
such
matter
<EOS>
,
how
could
you
imagine
me
so
where
your

at
stake

My

me
wrong

perfectly
right

I
may
be
sorry

I
may

hardly

Can
it
admit
of
a
question

<EOS>
It
be
disgraceful
to
us

it

<EOS>
You
do
not
love
him

nothing
could
have
justify
your

him

<EOS>
Fanny
have
not

so
comfortable
for

day

<EOS>
"
so
far
your
conduct
have
be
faultless
,

they
be
quite
mistaken

wish
you

do
otherwise

the
matter
do
not
end
here

<EOS>
Crawford

be
no
common
attachment

he
persevere
,
with
the
hope
of
create
that
regard
which
have
not

create
before

<EOS>
this
,
we
know

must
be
a
work
of
time

with

affectionate

<EOS>
You
have
prove
yourself
upright

prove
yourself
grateful

then
you

she
speak
with
a
warmth

quite
astonish
Edmund

which
she
blush
at
the
recollection

herself

when
she
see
his
look

hear
him

never

I
must
hope
well

<EOS>
I
be
aware

more
aware
than
Crawford
can
be
,
that
the
man
who
mean
to
make
you
love
him
(
you
have
due
notice
of
his
intention
)
must
have
very
uphill
work
,
for
there
be
all
your
early
attachment
and
habit
in
battle
array
;
and
before
he
can
get
your
heart
for
his
own
use
he
have
to
unfasten
it
from
all
the
hold
upon
thing
animate
and
inanimate
,
which
so
many
year
'
growth
have
confirm
,
and
which
be
considerably
tighten
for
the
moment
by
the
very
idea
of
separation
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
the
apprehension
of
be
force
to
quit
Mansfield
will
for
a
time
be
arm
you
against
him
.
<EOS>
I
wish
he
have
not
be
oblige
to
tell
you
what
he

try
for

I

he

know
you
as
well
as
I
do

Fanny

<EOS>
between
us
,
I
think
we
should
have
win
you

<EOS>
My
theoretical
and
his
practical
knowledge
together
could
not
have
fail
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
work
upon
my
plan
.
<EOS>
I
must
hope
,
however
,
that
time
,
prove
him
(
as
I
firmly
believe
it
will
)
to
deserve
you
by
his
steady
affection
,
will
give
him
his
reward
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
suppose
that
you
have
not
the
_
wish
_
to
love
him
 
the
natural
wish
of
gratitude

<EOS>
You
must
have
some
feeling
of
that
sort

You
must
be
sorry
for
your
own
indifference

"
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
so
totally
unlike
,
"
say
Fanny
,
avoid
a
direct
answer

"
we
be
so
very
,
very
different
in
all
our

happy

there
never

two
people
more
dissimilar

You
be
mistaken

Fanny

the
dissimilarity
be
not

strong

quite
enough
alike

You

both
warm

benevolent
feeling

,
Fanny

who
that
hear
him
read
,

see
you
listen
to
Shakespeare
the
other
night

will
think
you
unfitted
as
companion
?
<EOS>
You
forget
yourself
:
there
be
a
decide
difference
in
your
temper

I
allow
.
<EOS>
He
be
lively
,
you
be
serious
;
but
so
much
the
well
:
his
spirit
will
support
yours
.
<EOS>
It
be
your
disposition
to
be
easily
deject
and
to
fancy
difficulty
great
than
they
be
.
<EOS>
His
cheerfulness
will
counteract
this
.
<EOS>
He
see
difficulty
nowhere
:
and
his
pleasantness
and
gaiety
will
be
a
constant
support
to
you
.
<EOS>
Your
be
so
far
unlike
,
Fanny
,
do
not
in
the
small
degree
make
against
the
probability
of
your
happiness
together

do
not
imagine
it

<EOS>
I
be
myself
convinced
that
it
be
rather
a
favourable
circumstance
.
<EOS>
I
be
perfectly
persuade
that
the
temper
have
well
be
unlike

<EOS>
I
mean
unlike
in
the
flow
of
the
spirit

in
the
manner

in
the
inclination
for
much
or
little
company
,
in
the
propensity
to
talk

to
be
silent
,
to
be
grave
or
to
be
gay
.
<EOS>
some
opposition
here
be
,
I
be
thoroughly
convinced
,
friendly
to
matrimonial
happiness
.
<EOS>
I
exclude
extreme
,
of
course
;
and
a
very
close
resemblance
in
all
those
point
would
be
the
likeliest
way
to
produce
an
extreme

<EOS>
a
counteraction

gentle
and
continual
,
be
the
good
safeguard
of
manner
and
conduct
.
"
  
<EOS>
full
well
could
Fanny
guess
where
his
thought
be
now
:
Miss
Crawford
's
power
be
all
return
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
speak
of
her
cheerfully
from
the
hour
of
his
come
home
.
<EOS>
His
avoid
her
be
quite
at
an
end

<EOS>
He
have
dine
at
the
Parsonage
only
the
precede
day
.
  
<EOS>
after
leave
him
to
his
happy
thought
for
some
minute
,
Fanny
,
feel
it
due
to
herself
,
return
to
Mr.
Crawford
,
and
say
,
"
It
be
not
merely
in
_
temper
_
that
I
consider
him
as
totally
unsuited
to
myself
;
though
,
in
_
that
_
respect
,
I
think
the
difference
between
us
<EOS>
too
great
,
infinitely
too
great
<EOS>
:
his
spirit
often
oppress
me
;
but
there
be
something
in
him
which
I
object
to
still
more
.
<EOS>
I
must
say
,
cousin
,
that
I
can
not
approve
his
character
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
think
well
of
him
from
the
time
of
the
play
.
<EOS>
I
then
see
him
behave
,
as
it
appear
to
me
,
so
very
improperly
and
unfeelingly
 
I
may
speak
of
it
now
because
it
be
all
over
 
so
improperly
by
poor
Mr.
Rushworth
,
not
seem
to
care
how
he
expose
or
hurt
him
,
and
pay
attention
to
my
cousin
Maria
,
which
 
in
short
,
at
the
time
of
the
play
,
I
receive
an
impression
which
will
never
be
get
over
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Fanny

reply
Edmund
,
scarcely
hear
her
to
the

"
let
us
not

any
of

judge
by
what
we

folly

the

a
time

I
hate

wrong

the

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
a
bystander
,
"
say
Fanny
,
"
<EOS>
perhaps
I
see
more
than
you
do
;
and
I
do
think
that
Mr.
Rushworth
be
sometimes
very
jealous
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
very
possibly
.
<EOS>
no
wonder

<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
improper
than
the
whole
business
.
<EOS>
I
be
shocked
whenever
I
think
that
Maria
could
be
capable
of
it
;
but
,
if
she
could
undertake
the
part
,
we
must
not
be
surprised
at
the
rest
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
before
the
play
,
I
be
much
mistake
if
_
Julia

do
not

be
pay
her
attention

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Julia
!

I
have
hear
before
from
some
one
of
his
being
in
love
with
Julia
;
but
I
could
never
see
anything
of
it
.
<EOS>
and
,
Fanny
,
though
I
hope
I
do
justice
to
my
sister
'
good
quality
,
I
think
it
very
possible
that
they
may
,
one
or
both
,
be
more
desirous
of
be
admire
by
Crawford
,
and
may
shew
that
desire
rather
more
unguardedly
than
be
perfectly
prudent
.
<EOS>
I
can
remember
that
they
be
evidently
fond
of
his
society
;
and
with
such
encouragement
,
a
man
like
Crawford
,
lively
,
and
it
may
be
,
a
little
unthinking
,
may
be
lead
on
to
 
there
could
be
nothing
very
striking
,
because
it
be
clear
that
he
have
no
pretension

his
heart
be
reserve
for
you

<EOS>
and
I
must
say
,
that
its
being
for
you
have
raise
him
inconceivably
in
my
opinion

<EOS>
It
do
him
the
high
honour
;
it
shew
his
proper
estimation
of
the
blessing
of
domestic
happiness
and
pure
attachment
.
<EOS>
It
prove
him
unspoilt
by
his
uncle

<EOS>
It
prove
him
,
in
short
,
everything
that
I
have
be
use
to
wish
to
believe
him

fear

be
not

be
persuade
that

do
not
think
,
as
he
ought

on
serious
subject

say
,
rather
,
that
he
have
not

at
all
upon

subject

I
believe
to
be
a
good
deal
the
case

how
could
it

otherwise

with
such
an
education

under
the
disadvantage

indeed

it

hitherto

have
generally

good

will
supply
the
rest

be

well
aware
of
it
to
have
anything
to
say

they
walk
on
together
some
fifty
yard
in
mutual
silence

abstraction

Edmund
first
begin
again
    
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
much
pleased
by
her
manner
of
speak
of
it
yesterday

particularly
pleased

because
I
have
not
depend
upon
her
see
everything
in
so
just
a
light
.
<EOS>
I
know
she
be
very
fond
of
you
;
but
yet
I
be
afraid
of
her
not
estimate
your
worth
to
her
brother
quite
as
it
deserve
,
and
of
her
regretting
that
he
have
not
rather
fix
on
some
woman
of
distinction
or
fortune

<EOS>
I
be
afraid
of
the
bias
of
those
worldly
maxims

which
she
have
be
too
much
use
to
hear

it
be
very
different

<EOS>
She
desire
the
connexion
as
warmly
as
your
uncle
or
myself
.
<EOS>
We
have
a
long
talk
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
mention
the
subject
,
though
very
anxious
to
know
her
sentiment
;
but
I
have
not
be
in
the
room
five
minute
before
she
begin
introduce
it
with
all
that
openness
of
heart
,
and
sweet
peculiarity
of
manner
,
that
spirit
and
ingenuousness
which
be
so
much
a
part
of
herself
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grant
laugh
at
her
for
her
rapidity
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
be
Mrs.
Grant
in
the
room
,
then
?
"
  
"
yes
,
when
I
reach
the
house
I
find
the
two
sister
together
by
themselves
;
and
when
once
we
have
begin
,
we
have
not
do
with
you
,
Fanny
,
till
Crawford
and
Dr.
Grant
come
in
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
above
a
week
since
I
see
Miss
Crawford
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
she
lament
it
;
yet
own
it
may
have
be
good
.
<EOS>
You
will
see
her
,
however
,
before
she
go
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
angry
with
you
,
Fanny
;
you
must
be
prepare
for
that
.
<EOS>
She
call
herself
very
angry
,
but
you
can
imagine
her
anger
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
regret
and
disappointment
of
a
sister
,
who
think
her
brother
have
a
right
to
everything
he
may
wish
for
,
at
the
first
moment
.
<EOS>
She
be
hurt
,
as
you
would
be
for
William
;
but
she
love
and
esteem
you
with
all
her
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
she
would
be
very
angry
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
Fanny
,
"
cry
Edmund
,
press
her
arm
closer
to
him
,
"
do
not
let
the
idea
of
her
anger
distress
you
.
<EOS>
It
be
anger
to
be
talk
of
rather
than
feel
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
be
make
for
love
and
kindness
,
not
for
resentment
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
could
have
overhear
her
tribute
of
praise
;
I
wish
you
could
have
see
her
countenance
,
when
she
say
that
you
_
should
_
be
Henry
's
wife
.
<EOS>
and
I
observe
that
she
always
speak
of
you
as
"
Fanny
,
"
which
she
be
never
use
to
do
;
and
it
have
a
sound
of
most
sisterly
cordiality
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
Mrs.
Grant
,
do
she
say
 
do
she
speak
;
be
she
there
all
the
time
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
she
be
agree
exactly
with
her
sister
.
<EOS>
the
surprise
of
your
refusal
,
Fanny
,
seem
to
have
be
unbounde
.
<EOS>
that
you
could
refuse
such
a
man
as
Henry
Crawford
seem
more
than
they
can
understand
.
<EOS>
I
say
what
I
could
for
you
;
but
in
good
truth
,
as
they
state
the
case
 
you
must
prove
yourself
to
be
in
your
sense
as
soon
as
you
can
by
a
different
conduct
;
nothing
else
will
satisfy
them
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
tease
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
do
.
<EOS>
do
not
turn
away
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
_
should
_
have
think
,
"
say
Fanny
,
after
a
pause
of
recollection
and
exertion
,
"
that
every
woman
must
have
feel
the
possibility
of
a
man
's
not
be
approve
,
not
be
love
by
some
one
of
her
sex
at
least
,
let
him
be
ever
so
generally
agreeable
.
<EOS>
let
him
have
all
the
perfection
in
the
world
,
I
think
it
ought
not
to
be
set
down
as
certain
that
a
man
must
be
acceptable
to
every
woman
he
may
happen
to
like
himself
.
<EOS>
but
,
even
suppose
it
be
so
,
allow
Mr.
Crawford
to
have
all
the
claim
which
his
sister
think
he
have
,
how
be
I
to
be
prepare
to
meet
him
with
any
feeling
answerable
to
his
own
?
<EOS>
He
take
me
wholly
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
an
idea
that
his
behaviour
to
me
before
have
any
meaning
;
and
surely
I
be
not
to
be
teach
myself
to
like
him
only
because
he
be
take
what
seem
very
idle
notice
of
me
.
<EOS>
in
my
situation
,
it
would
have
be
the
extreme
of
vanity
to
be
form
expectation
on
Mr.
Crawford
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
his
sister
,
rate
him
as
they
do
,
must
have
think
it
so
,
suppose
he
have
mean
nothing
.
<EOS>
how
,
then
,
be
I
to
be
 
to
be
in
love
with
him
the
moment
he
say
he
be
with
me
?
<EOS>
how
be
I
to
have
an
attachment
at
his
service
,
as
soon
as
it
be
ask
for
?
<EOS>
His
sister
should
consider
me
as
well
as
him
.
<EOS>
the
high
his
desert
,
the
more
improper
for
me
ever
to
have
think
of
him
.
<EOS>
and
,
and
 
we
think
very
differently
of
the
nature
of
woman
,
if
they
can
imagine
a
woman
so
very
soon
capable
of
return
an
affection
as
this
seem
to
imply
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
dear
Fanny
,
now
I
have
the
truth
.
<EOS>
I
know
this
to
be
the
truth
;
and
most
worthy
of
you
be
such
feeling
.
<EOS>
I
have
attribute
them
to
you
before
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
could
understand
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
now
give
exactly
the
explanation
which
I
venture
to
make
for
you
to
your
friend
and
Mrs.
Grant
,
and
they
be
both
better
satisfied
,
though
your
warm
-
hearted
friend
be
still
run
away
with
a
little
by
the
enthusiasm
of
her
fondness
for
Henry
.
<EOS>
I
tell
them
that
you
be
of
all
human
creature
the
one
over
whom
habit
have
most
power
and
novelty
least
;
and
that
the
very
circumstance
of
the
novelty
of
Crawford
's
address
be
against
him
.
<EOS>
Their
be
so
new
and
<EOS>
so
recent
be
all
in
their
disfavour
;
that
you
could
tolerate
nothing
that
you
be
not
use
to
;
and
a
great
deal
more
to
the
same
purpose
,
to
give
them
a
knowledge
of
your
character
.
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
make
us
laugh
by
her
plan
of
encouragement
for
her
brother
.
<EOS>
She
mean
to
urge
him
to
persevere
in
the
hope
of
be
love
in
time
,
and
of
have
his
address
most
kindly
receive
at
the
end
of
about
ten
year
'
happy
marriage
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
could
with
difficulty
give
the
smile
that
be
here
ask
for
.
<EOS>
Her
feeling
be
all
in
revolt
.
<EOS>
She
fear
she
have
be
do
wrong
:
say
too
much
,
overact
the
caution
which
she
have
be
fancy
necessary
;
in
guard
against
one
evil
,
lay
herself
open
to
another
;
and
to
have
Miss
Crawford
's
liveliness
repeat
to
her
at
such
a
moment
,
and
on
such
a
subject
,
be
a
bitter
aggravation
.
  
<EOS>
Edmund
see
weariness
and
distress
in
her
face
,
and
immediately
resolve
to
forbear
all
farth
discussion
;
and
not
even
to
mention
the
name
of
Crawford
again
,
except
as
it
may
be
connect
with
what
_
must
_
be
agreeable
to
her
.
<EOS>
on
this
principle
,
he
soon
afterwards
observe
 
<EOS>
"
They
go
on
Monday
.
<EOS>
You
be
sure
,
therefore
,
of
see
your
friend
either
to

morrow

Sunday

<EOS>
They
really
go
on
Monday
;

I
be
within
a
trifle
of
be
persuade
to
stay
at
Lessingby

that
very
day

I
have
almost

it

what
a

it

have
make

more
at

I
be
most
kindly

have
nearly
consent

have
I
receive
any
letter
from
Mansfield

to
tell
me
how
you
be
all
go
on

I
believe
I
should
certainly
have
staid
;
but
I
know
nothing
that
have
happen
here
for
a
fortnight
,
and
feel
that
I
have
be
away
long
enough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
spend
your
time
pleasantly
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

that
is

it

the
fault

be
all
very
pleasant

doubt
their
find
me
so

I
take
uneasiness
with
me

there
be
no

rid
of
it

in

again

the

<EOS>
"
yes

very
well

<EOS>
pleasant

good

humoured

unaffected

I
be
spoilt

Fanny

for
common

society

humour

unaffected
girl
will
not
do
for
a
man
who
have

use

sensible
woman

<EOS>
They
be
two
distinct
order
of
be
.
<EOS>
You
and
Miss
Crawford
have
make
me
too
nice
.
"
  
<EOS>
still
,
however
,
Fanny
be
oppress
and
weary
;
he
see
it
in
her
look
,
it
could
not
be
talk
away
;
and
attempt
it
no
more
,
he
lead
her
directly
,
with
the
kind
authority
of
a
privileged
guardian
,
into
the
house
.
    
<EOS>
Edmund
now
believe
himself
perfectly
acquaint
with
all
that
Fanny
could
tell
,
or
could
leave
to
be
conjecture
of
her
sentiment
,
and
he
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
,
as
he
before
presume
,
too
hasty
a
measure
on
Crawford
's
side
,
and
time
must
be
give
to
make
the
idea
first
familiar
,
and
then
agreeable
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
use
to
the
consideration
of
his
being
in
love
with
her
,
and
then
a
return
of
affection
may
not
be
very
distant
.
  
<EOS>
He
give
this
opinion
as
the
result
of
the
conversation
to
his
father
;
and
recommend
there
be
nothing
more
say
to
her
:
no
farther
attempt
to
influence
or
persuade
;
but
that
everything
should
be
leave
to
Crawford
's
assiduity
,
and
the
natural
working
of
her
own
mind
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
promise
that
it
should
be
so
.
<EOS>
Edmund
's
account
of
Fanny
's
disposition
<EOS>
he
could
believe
to
be
just
;
he
suppose
she
have
all
those
feeling
,
but
he
must
consider
it
as
very
unfortunate
that
she
_
have
_
;
for
,
less
willing
than
his
son
to
trust
to
the
future
,
he
could
not
help
fear
that
if
such
very
long
allowance
of
time
and
habit
be
necessary
for
her
,
she
may
not
have
persuade
herself
into
receive
his
address
properly
before
the
young
man
's
inclination
for
pay
them
be
over
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
to
be
do
,
however
,
but
to
submit
quietly
and
hope
the
good
.
  
<EOS>
the
promised
visit
from
"
her
friend
,
"
as
Edmund
call
Miss
Crawford
,
be
a
formidable
threat
to
Fanny
,
and
she
live
in
continual
terror
of
it
.
<EOS>
as
a
sister
,
so
partial
and
so
angry
,
and
so
little
scrupulous
of
what
she
say
,
and
in
another
light
so
triumphant
and
secure
,
she
be
in
every
way
an
object
of
painful
alarm
.
<EOS>
Her
displeasure
,
her
penetration
,
and
her
happiness
be
all
fearful
to
encounter
;
and
the
dependence
of
have
other
present
when
they
meet
be
Fanny
's
only
support
in
look
forward
to
it
.
<EOS>
She
absent
herself
as
little
as
possible
from
Lady
Bertram
,
keep
away
from
the
East
room
,
and
take
no
solitary
walk
in
the
shrubbery
,
in
her
caution
to
avoid
any
sudden
attack
.
  
<EOS>
She
succeed
.
<EOS>
She
be
safe
in
the
breakfast
-
room
,
with
her
aunt
,
when
Miss
Crawford
do
come
;
and
the
first
misery
over
,
and
Miss
Crawford
look
and
speak
with
much
less
particularity
of
expression
than
she
have
anticipate
,
Fanny
begin
to
hope
there
would
be
nothing
bad
to
be
endure
than
a
half
-
hour
of
moderate
agitation
.
<EOS>
but
here
she
hope
too
much
;
Miss
Crawford
be
not
the
slave
of
opportunity
.
<EOS>
She
be
determined
to
see
Fanny
alone
,
and
therefore
say
to
her
tolerably
soon
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
I
must
speak
to
you
for
a
few
minute
somewhere
"
;
word
that
Fanny
feel
all
over
her
,
in
all
her
pulse
and
all
her
nerve
.
<EOS>
Denial
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
Her
habit
of
ready
submission
,
on
the
contrary
,
make
her
almost
instantly
rise
and
lead
the
way
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
She
do
it
with
wretched
feeling
,
but
it
be
inevitable
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
no
sooner
in
the
hall
than
all
restraint
of
countenance
be
over
on
Miss
Crawford
's
side
.
<EOS>
She
immediately
shake
her
head
at
Fanny
with
arch
,
yet
affectionate
reproach
,
and
take
her
hand
,
seem
hardly
able
to
help
begin
directly
.
<EOS>
She
say
nothing
,
however
,
but
,
"
sad
,
sad
girl
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
when
I
shall
have
do
scold
you
,
"
and
have
discretion
enough
to
reserve
the
rest
till
they
may
be
secure
of
have
four
wall
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
Fanny
naturally
turn
upstairs
,
and
take
her
guest
to
the
apartment
which
be
now
always
fit
for
comfortable
use
;
open
the
door
,
however
,
with
a
most
ache
heart
,
and
feeling
that
she
have
a
more
distressing
scene
before
her
than
ever
that
spot
have
yet
witness
.
<EOS>
but
the
evil
ready
to
burst
on
her
<EOS>
be
at
least
delay
by
the
sudden
change
in
Miss
Crawford
's
idea
;
by
the
strong
effect
on
her
mind
which
the
finding
herself
in
the
East
room
again
produce
.
  
<EOS>
"
ha
!
"
<EOS>
she
cry
,
with
instant
animation
,
"
be
I
here
again
?
<EOS>
the
East
room
!
<EOS>
once
only
be
I
in
this
room
before
"
;
and
after
stop
to
look
about
her
,
and
seemingly
to
retrace
all
that
have
then
pass
,
she
add
,
"
once
only
before
.
<EOS>
do
you
remember
it
?
<EOS>
I
come
to
rehearse
.
<EOS>
Your
cousin
come
too

and
we
have
a
rehearsal
.
<EOS>
You
be
our
audience
and
prompter

<EOS>
a
delightful
rehearsal

<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
it

<EOS>
here
we
be
,
just
in
this
part
of
the
room
:
here
be
your
cousin

here
be
I
,
here
be
the
chair

<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
why
will
such
thing
ever
pass
away
?
"
  
<EOS>
happily
for
her
companion
,
she
want
no
answer
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
be
entirely
self
-
engross

<EOS>
She
be
in
a
reverie
of
sweet
remembrance

the
scene
we
be
rehearse
be
so
very
remarkable
!
<EOS>
the
subject
of
it
so
very
 
very
 
<EOS>
what
shall
I
say
?
<EOS>
He
be
to
be
describe
and
recommend
matrimony
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
see
him
now
,
try
to
be
as
demure
and
compose
as
Anhalt
ought
,
through
the
two
long
speech
.
<EOS>
"
when
two
sympathetic
heart
meet
in
the
marriage
state
,
matrimony
may
be
call
a
happy
life
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
no
time
can
ever
wear
out
the
impression
I
have
of
his
look
and
voice
as
he
say
those
word
.
<EOS>
It
be
curious
,
very
curious
,
that
we
should
have
such
a
scene
to
play
!
<EOS>
if
I
have
the
power
of
recall
any
one
week
of
my
existence
,
it
should
be
that
week
 
that
act
week
.
<EOS>
say
what
you
would
,
Fanny
,
it
should
be
_
that
_
;
for
I
never
know
such
exquisite
happiness
in
any
other
.
<EOS>
His
sturdy
spirit
to
bend
as
it
do
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
it
be
sweet
beyond
expression
.
<EOS>
but
alas
,
that
very
evening
destroy
it
all
.
<EOS>
that
very
evening
bring
your
most
unwelcome
uncle
.
<EOS>
Poor
Sir
Thomas
,
who
be
glad
to
see
you
?
<EOS>
yet
,
Fanny
,
do
not
imagine
I
would
now
speak
disrespectfully
of
Sir
Thomas
,
though
I
certainly
do
hate
him
for
many
a
week
.
<EOS>
no
,
I
do
him
justice
now
.
<EOS>
He
be
just
what
the
head
of
such
a
family
should
be
.
<EOS>
nay
,
in
sober
sadness
,
I
believe
I
now
love
you
all
.
"
<EOS>
and
have
say
so
,
with
a
degree
of
tenderness
and
consciousness
which
Fanny
have
never
see
in
her
before
,
and
now
think
only
too
become
,
she
turn
away
for
a
moment
to
recover
herself
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
have
a
little
fit
since
I
come
into
this
room
,
as
you
may
perceive
,
"
say
she
presently
,
with
a
playful
smile
,
"
but
it
be
over
now
;
so
let
us
sit
down
and
be
comfortable
;
for
as
to
scold
you
,
Fanny
,
which
I
come
fully
intend
to
do
,
I
have
not
the
heart
for
it
when
it
come
to
the
point
.
"
<EOS>
and
embrace
her
very
affectionately
,
"
good
,
gentle
Fanny
!
<EOS>
when
I
think
of
this
be
the
last
time
of
see
you
for
I
do
not
know
how
long
,
I
feel
it
quite
impossible
to
do
anything
but
love
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
be
affect
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
foresee
anything
of
this
,
and
her
feeling
could
seldom
withstand
the
melancholy
influence
of
the
word
"
last
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
cry
as
if
she
have
love
Miss
Crawford
more
than
she
possibly
could
;
and
Miss
Crawford
,
yet
farther
soften
by
the
sight
of
such
emotion
,
hang
about
her
with
fondness
,
and
say
,
"
I
hate
to
leave
you
.
<EOS>
I
shall
see
no
one
half
so
amiable
where
I
be
go
.
<EOS>
who
say
we
shall
not
be
sister
?
<EOS>
I
know
we
shall
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
we
be
bear
to
be
connect
;
and
those
tear
convince
me
that
you
feel
it
too
,
dear
Fanny
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
rouse
herself
,
and
reply
only
in
part
,
say
,
"
<EOS>
but
you
be
only
go
from
one
set
of
friend
to
another
.
<EOS>
You
be
go
to
a
very
particular
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
very
true
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fraser
have
be
my
intimate
friend
for
year
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
not
the
least
inclination
to
go
near
her
.
<EOS>
I
can
think
only
of
the
friend
I
be
leave
:
my
excellent
sister
,
yourself
,
and
the
Bertrams
in
general
.
<EOS>
You
have
all
so
much
more
_
heart
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
among
you
than
one
find
in
the
world
at
large
.
<EOS>
You
all
give
me
a
feeling
of
be
able
to
trust
and
confide
in
you
,
which
in
common
intercourse
one
know
nothing
of
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
settle
with
Mrs.
Fraser
not
to
go
to
her
till
after
Easter
,
a
much
well
time
for
the
visit
,
but
now
I
can
not
put
her
off
.
<EOS>
and
when
I
have
do
with
her
<EOS>
I
must
go
to
her
sister
,
Lady
Stornaway
,
because
_
she
_
be
rather
my
most
particular
friend
of
the
two
,
but
I
have
not
care
much
for
_
her
_
<EOS>
these
three
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
after
this
speech
the
two
girl
sit
many
minute
silent
,
each
thoughtful
:
<EOS>
fanny
meditate
on
the
different
sort
of
friendship
in
the
world
,
Mary
on
something
of
less
philosophic
tendency
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
first
speak
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
perfectly
I
remember
my
resolving
to
look
for
you
upstairs
,
and
set
off
to
find
my
way
to
the
East
room
,
without
have
an
idea
whereabout
it
be
!
<EOS>
how
well
I
remember
what
I
be
think
of
as
I
come
along
,
and
my
look
in
and
see
you
here
sit
at
this
table
at
work
;
and
then
your
cousin
's
astonishment
,
when
he
open
the
door
,
at
see
me
here
!
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
your
uncle
be
return
that
very
evening
!
<EOS>
there
never
be
anything
quite
like
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
another
short
fit
of
abstraction
follow
,
when
,
shake
it
off
,
she
thus
attack
her
companion
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
Fanny
,
you
be
absolutely
in
a
reverie
.
<EOS>
thinking
,
I
hope
,
of
one
who
be
always
think
of
you
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
that
I
could
transport
you
for
a
short
time
into
our
circle
in
town
,
that
you
may
understand
how
your
power
over
Henry
be
think
of
there
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
the
envying
and
heartburning
of
dozen
and
dozen
;
the
wonder
,
the
incredulity
that
will
be
feel
at
hear
what
you
have
do
!
<EOS>
for
as
to
secrecy
,
Henry
be
quite
the
hero
of
an
old
romance
,
and
glory
in
his
chain
.
<EOS>
You
should
come
to
London
to
know
how
to
estimate
your
conquest
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
to
see
how
he
be
courted
,
and
how
I
be
court
for
his
sake
!
<EOS>
now
,
I
be
well
aware
that
I
shall
not
be
half
so
welcome
to
Mrs.
Fraser
in
consequence
of
his
situation
with
you
.
<EOS>
when
she
come
to
know
the
truth
she
will
,
very
likely
,
wish
me
in
Northamptonshire
again
;
for
there
be
a
daughter
of
Mr.
Fraser
,
by
a
first
wife
,
whom
she
be
wild
to
get
married
,
and
want
Henry
to
take
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
she
have
be
try
for
him
to
such
a
degree
.
<EOS>
innocent
and
quiet
as
you
sit
here
,
you
can
not
have
an
idea
of
the
_
sensation
_
that
you
will
be
occasion
,
of
the
curiosity
there
will
be
to
see
you
,
of
the
endless
question
I
shall
have
to
answer
!
<EOS>
Poor
Margaret
Fraser
will
be
at
me
for
ever
about
your
eye
and
your
tooth
,
and
how
you
do
your
hair
,
and
who
make
your
shoe
.
<EOS>
I
wish
Margaret
be
marry
,
for
my
poor
friend
's
sake
,
for
I
look
upon
the
Frasers
to
be
about
as
unhappy
as
most
other
married
people
.
<EOS>
and
yet
it
be
a
most
desirable
match
for
Janet
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
We
be
all
delighted
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
do
otherwise
than
accept
him
,
for
he
be
rich
,
and
she
have
nothing
;
but
he
turn
out
ill
-
temper
and
_
exigeant
_
,
and
want
a
young
woman
,
a
beautiful
young
woman
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
to
be
as
steady
as
himself
.
<EOS>
and
my
friend
do
not
manage
him
well
;
she
do
not
seem
to
know
how
to
make
the
good
of
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
spirit
of
irritation
which
,
to
say
nothing
bad
,
be
certainly
very
ill
-
breed
.
<EOS>
in
their
house
I
shall
call
to
mind
the
conjugal
manner
of
Mansfield
Parsonage
with
respect
.
<EOS>
even
Dr.
Grant
do
shew
a
thorough
confidence
in
my
sister
,
and
a
certain
consideration
for
her
judgment
,
which
make
one
feel
there
<EOS>
_
be
_
attachment
;
but
of
that
I
shall
see
nothing
with
the
Frasers
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
at
Mansfield
for
ever
,
Fanny
.
<EOS>
My
own
sister
as
a
wife
,
Sir
Thomas
Bertram
as
a
husband
,
be
my
standard
of
perfection
.
<EOS>
poor
Janet
have
be
sadly
take
in
,
and
yet
there
be
nothing
improper
on
her
side
:
<EOS>
she
do
not
run
into
the
match
inconsiderately
;
there
be
no
want
of
foresight
.
<EOS>
She
take
three
day
to
consider
of
his
proposal
,
and
during
those
three
day
ask
the
advice
of
everybody
connect
with
her
whose
opinion
be
worth
have
,
and
especially
apply
to
my
late
dear
aunt
,
whose
knowledge
of
the
world
make
her
judgment
very
generally
and
deservedly
look
up
to
by
all
the
young
people
of
her
acquaintance
,
and
she
be
decidedly
in
favour
of
Mr.
Fraser
.
<EOS>
this
seem
as
if
nothing
be
a
security
for
matrimonial
comfort
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
so
much
to
say
for
my
friend
Flora
,
who
jilt
a
very
nice
young
man
in
the
blue
for
the
sake
of
that
horrid
Lord
Stornaway
,
who
have
about
as
much
sense
,
Fanny
,
as
Mr.
Rushworth
,
but
much
worse
-
look
,
and
with
a
blackguard
character
.
<EOS>
I
_
have
_
<EOS>
my
doubt
at
the
time
about
her
be
right
,
for
he
have
not
even
the
air
of
a
gentleman
,
<EOS>
and
now
I
be
sure
she
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
by
the
bye
,
Flora
Ross
be
die
for
Henry
the
first
winter
she
come
out
.
<EOS>
but
be
I
to
attempt
to
tell
you
of
all
the
woman
whom
I
have
know
to
be
in
love
with
him
,
I
should
never
have
do
.
<EOS>
It
be
you
,
only
you
,
insensible
Fanny
,
who
can
think
of
him
with
anything
like
indifference
.
<EOS>
but
be
you
so
insensible
as
you
profess
yourself
?
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
I
see
you
be
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
,
indeed
,
so
deep
a
blush
over
Fanny
's
face
at
that
moment
as
may
warrant
strong
suspicion
in
a
predisposed
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
excellent
creature
!
<EOS>
I
will
not
tease
you
.
<EOS>
everything
shall
take
its
course
.
<EOS>
but
,
dear
Fanny
,
you
must
allow
that
you
be
not
so
absolutely
unprepared
to
have
the
question
ask
as
your
cousin
fancy
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
possible
but
that
you
must
have
have
some
thought
on
the
subject
,
some
surmise
as
to
what
may
be
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
see
that
he
be
try
to
please
you
by
every
attention
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
be
not
he
devoted
to
you
at
the
ball
?
<EOS>
and
then
before
the
ball
,
the
necklace
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
you
receive
it
just
as
it
be
mean
.
<EOS>
You
be
as
conscious
as
heart
could
desire
.
<EOS>
I
remember
it
perfectly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
mean
,
then
,
that
your
brother
know
of
the
necklace
beforehand
?
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
,
_
<EOS>
that
_
be
not
fair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Knew
of
it
!
<EOS>
It
be
his
own
do
entirely
,
<EOS>
his
own
thought
.
<EOS>
I
be
ashamed
to
say
that
it
have
never
enter
my
head
,
but
I
be
delighted
to
act
on
his
proposal
for
both
your
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
will
not
say
,
"
reply
Fanny
,
"
that
I
be
not
half
afraid
at
the
time
of
its
be
so
,
for
there
be
something
in
your
look
that
frighten
me
,
but
not
at
first
;
I
be
as
unsuspicious
of
it
at
first
 
indeed
,
indeed
I
be
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
true
as
that
I
sit
here
.
<EOS>
and
have
I
have
an
idea
of
it
,
nothing
should
have
induce
me
to
accept
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
as
to
your
brother
's
behaviour
,
certainly
I
be
sensible
of
a
particularity
:
I
have
be
sensible
of
it
some
little
time
,
perhaps
two
or
three
week
;
but
then
I
consider
it
as
mean
nothing
<EOS>
:
I
put
it
down
as
simply
be
his
way
,
and
be
as
far
from
suppose
as
from
wish
him
to
have
any
serious
thought
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
,
Miss
Crawford
,
be
an
inattentive
observer
of
what
be
pass
between
him
and
some
part
of
this
family
in
the
summer
and
autumn
.
<EOS>
I
be
quiet
,
but
I
be
not
blind
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
see
that
Mr.
Crawford
allow
himself
in
gallantry
which
do
mean
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
deny
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
now
and
then
be
a
sad
flirt
,
and
care
very
little
for
the
havoc
he
may
be
make
in
young
lady
'
affection
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
scold
him
for
it
,
but
it
be
his
only
fault
;
and
there
be
this
to
be
say
,
that
very
few
young
lady
have
any
affection
worth
care
for
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
Fanny
,
the
glory
of
fix
one
who
have
be
shoot
at
by
so
many
;
of
have
it
in
one
's
power
to
pay
off
the
debt
of
one
's
sex
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
be
sure
it
be
not
in
woman
's
nature
to
refuse
such
a
triumph
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
shake
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
think
well
of
a
man
who
sport
with
any
woman
's
feeling
;
and
there
may
often
be
a
great
deal
more
suffer
than
a
stander
-
by
can
judge
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
defend
him
.
<EOS>
I
leave
him
entirely
to
your
mercy
,
and
when
he
have
get
you
at
Everingham
,
I
do
not
care
how
much
you
lecture
him
.
<EOS>
but
this
I
will
say
,
that
his
fault
,
the
like
to
make
girl
a
little
in
love
with
him
,
be
not
half
so
dangerous
to
a
wife
's
happiness
as
a
tendency
to
fall
in
love
himself
,
which
he
have
never
be
addict
to
.
<EOS>
and
I
do
seriously
and
truly
believe

he
be
attach
to
you
in
a
way
that
he
never
be
to
any
woman
before
;
that
he
love
you
with
all
his
heart
,
and
will
love
you
as
nearly
for
ever
as
possible
.
<EOS>
if
any
man
ever
love
a
woman
for
ever
,
I
think
Henry
will
do
as
much
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
could
not
avoid
a
faint
smile
,
but
have
nothing
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
imagine
Henry
ever
to
have
be
happy
,
"
continue
Mary
presently
,
"
than
when
he
have
succeed
in
get
your
brother
's
commission
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
have
make
a
sure
push
at
Fanny
's
feeling
here
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
how
very
,
very
kind
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
he
must
have
exert
himself
very
much
,
for
I
know
the
party
he
have
to
move
.
<EOS>
the
Admiral
hate
trouble
,
and
scorn
ask
favour
;
and
there
be
so
many
young
man
's
claim
to
be
attend
to
in
the
same
way
,
that
a
friendship
and
energy
,
not
very
determined
,
be
easily
put
by
.
<EOS>
what
a
happy
creature
William
must
be
!
<EOS>
I
wish
we
could
see
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Fanny
's
mind
be
throw
into
the
most
distressing
of
all
its
variety
.
<EOS>
the
recollection
of
what
have
be
do
for
William
be
always
the
most
powerful
disturber
of
every
decision
against
Mr.
Crawford
;
and
she
sit
think
deeply
of
it
till
Mary
,
who
have
be
first
watch
her
complacently
,
and
then
muse
on
something
else
,
suddenly
call
her
attention
by
say
:
"
I
should
like
to
sit
talk
with
you
here
all
day
,
but
we
must
not
forget
the
lady
below
,
and
so
good
-
bye
,
my
dear
,
my
amiable
,
my
excellent
Fanny
,
for
though
we
shall
nominally
part
in
the
breakfast
-
parlour
,
I
must
take
leave
of
you
here
.
<EOS>
and
I
do
take
leave
,
long
for
a
happy
reunion
,
and
trust
that
when
we
meet
again
,
it
will
be
under
circumstance
which
may
open
our
heart
to
each
other
without
any
remnant
or
shadow
of
reserve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
a
very
,
very
kind
embrace
,
and
some
agitation
of
manner
,
accompany
these
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
see
your
cousin
in
town
soon
:
he
talk
of
be
there
tolerably
soon
;
and
Sir
Thomas
,
I
dare
say
,
in
the
course
of
the
spring
;
and
your
eld
cousin
,
and
the
rushworth
,
and
Julia
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
of
meet
again
and
again
,
and
all
but
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
two
favour
to
ask
,
<EOS>
Fanny
:
one
be
your
correspondence
.
<EOS>
You
must
write
to
me
.
<EOS>
and
the
other
,
that
you
will
often
call
on
Mrs.
Grant
,
and
make
her
amend
for
my
be
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
first
,
at
least
,
of
these
favour
Fanny
would
rather
not
have
be
ask
;
but
it
be
impossible
for
her
to
refuse
the
correspondence
;
it
be
impossible
for
her
even
not
to
accede
to
it
more
readily
than
her
own
judgment
authorise
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
resist
so
much
apparent
affection
.
<EOS>
Her
disposition
be
peculiarly
calculate
to
value
a
fond
treatment
,
and
from
have
hitherto
know
so
little
of
it
,
she
be
the
more
overcome
by
Miss
Crawford
's
.
<EOS>
besides
,
there
be
gratitude
towards
her
,
for
have
make
their
_
tete
-
a
-
tete
_
so
much
less
painful
than
her
fear
have
predict
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
over
,
and
she
have
escape
without
reproach
and
without
detection
.
<EOS>
Her
secret
be
still
her
own
;
and
while
that
be
the
case
,
she
think
she
could
resign
herself
to
almost
everything
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
evening
there
be
another
parting
.
<EOS>
Henry
Crawford
come
and
sit
some
time
with
them
;
and
her
spirit
not
be
previously
in
the
strong
state
,
her
heart
be
soften
for
a
while
towards
him
,
because
he
really
seem
to
feel
.
<EOS>
quite
unlike
his
usual
self
,
he
scarcely
say
anything
.
<EOS>
He
be
evidently
oppress
,
and
Fanny
must
grieve
for
him
,
though
hope
she
may
never
see
him
again
till
he
be
the
husband
of
some
other
woman
.
  
<EOS>
when
it
come
to
the
moment
of
parting
,
he
would
take
her
hand
,
he
would
not
be
deny
it
;
he
say
nothing
,
however
,
or
nothing
that
she
hear
,
and
when
he
have
leave
the
room
,
she
be
better
pleased
that
such
a
token
of
friendship
have
pass
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
morrow
the
Crawfords
be
go
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Crawford
go
,
Sir
Thomas
's
next
object
be
that
he
should
be
miss
;
and
he
entertain
great
hope
that
his
niece
would
find
a
blank
in
the
loss
of
those
attention
which
at
the
time
she
have
feel
,
or
fancy
,
an
evil
.
<EOS>
She
have
taste
of
consequence
in
its
most
flattering
form
;
and
he
do
hope
that
the
loss
of
it
,
the
sinking
again
into
nothing
,
would
awaken
very
wholesome
regret
in
her
mind
.
<EOS>
He
watch
her
with
this
idea
;
but
he
could
hardly
tell
with
what
success
.
<EOS>
He
hardly
know
whether
there
be
any
difference
in
her
spirit
or
not
.
<EOS>
She
be
always
so
gentle
and
retire
that
her
emotion
be
beyond
his
discrimination
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
understand
her
:
he
feel
that
he
do
not
;
and
therefore
apply
to
Edmund
to
tell
him
how
she
stand
affected
on
the
present
occasion
,
and
whether
she
be
more
or
less
happy
than
she
have
be
.
  
<EOS>
Edmund
do
not
discern
any
symptom
of
regret
,
and
think
his
father
a
little
unreasonable
in
suppose
the
first
three
or
four
day
could
produce
any
.
  
<EOS>
what
chiefly
surprise
Edmund
be
,
that
Crawford
's
sister
,
the
friend
and
companion
who
have
be
so
much
to
her
,
should
not
be
more
visibly
regretted
.
<EOS>
He
wonder
that
Fanny
speak
so
seldom
of
_
her
_
,
and
have
so
little
voluntarily
to
say
of
her
concern
at
this
separation
.
  
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
it
be
this
sister
,
this
friend
and
companion
,
who
be
now
the
chief
bane
of
Fanny
's
comfort
.
<EOS>
if
she
could
have
believe
Mary
's
future
fate
as
unconnecte
with
Mansfield
as
she
be
determine
the
brother
's
should
be
,
if
she
could
have
hope
her
return
thither
to
be
as
distant
as
she
be
much
inclined
to
think
his
,
she
would
have
be
light
of
heart
indeed
;
but
the
more
she
recollect
and
observe
,
the
more
deeply
be
she
convince
that
everything
be
now
in
a
fairer
train
for
Miss
Crawford
's
marry
Edmund
than
it
have
ever
be
before
.
<EOS>
on
his
side
the
inclination
be
strong
,
on
her
less
equivocal
.
<EOS>
His
objection
,
the
scruple
of
his
integrity
,
seem
all
do
away
,
nobody
could
tell
how
;
and
the
doubt
and
hesitation
of
her
ambition
be
equally
get
over
 
and
equally
without
apparent
reason
.
<EOS>
It
could
only
be
impute
to
increase
attachment
.
<EOS>
His
good
and
her
bad
feeling
yield
to
love
,
and
such
love
must
unite
them
.
<EOS>
He
be
to
go
to
town
as
soon
as
some
business
relative
to
Thornton
Lacey
be
complete
 
perhaps
within
a
fortnight
;
he
talk
of
go
,
he
love
to
talk
of
it
;
and
when
once
with
her
again
,
Fanny
could
not
doubt
the
rest
.
<EOS>
Her
acceptance
must
be
as
certain
as
his
offer
;
and
yet
there
be
bad
feeling
still
remain
which
make
the
prospect
of
it
most
sorrowful
to
her
,
<EOS>
independently
,
she
believe
,
independently
of
self
.
  
<EOS>
in
their
very
last
conversation
,
Miss
Crawford
,
in
spite
of
some
amiable
sensation
,
and
much
personal
kindness
,
have
still
be
Miss
Crawford
;
still
shew
a
mind
lead
astray
and
bewilder
,
and
without
any
suspicion
of
be
so
;
darken
,
yet
fancy
itself
light
.
<EOS>
She
may
love
,
but
she
do
not
deserve
Edmund
by
any
other
sentiment
.
<EOS>
Fanny
believe
there
be
scarcely
a
second
feeling
in
common
between
them
;
and
she
may
be
forgive
by
old
sage
for
look
on
the
chance
of
Miss
Crawford
's
future
improvement
as
nearly
desperate
,
for
think
that
if
Edmund
's
influence
in
this
season
of
love
have
already
do
so
little
in
clear
her
judgment
,
and
regulate
her
notion
,
his
worth
would
be
finally
waste
on
her
even
in
year
of
matrimony
.
  
<EOS>
experience
may
have
hope
more
for
any
young
people
so
circumstanced
,
and
impartiality
would
not
have
deny
to
Miss
Crawford
's
nature
that
participation
of
the
general
nature
of
woman
which
would
lead
her
to
adopt
the
opinion
of
the
man
she
love
and
respect
as
her
own
.
<EOS>
but
as
such
be
Fanny
's
persuasion
,
she
suffer
very
much
from
them
,
and
could
never
speak
of
Miss
Crawford
without
pain
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
,
meanwhile
,
go
on
with
his
own
hope
and
his
own
observation
,
still
feel
a
right
,
by
all
his
knowledge
of
human
nature
,
to
expect
to
see
the
effect
of
the
loss
of
power
and
consequence
on
his
niece
's
spirit
,
and
the
past
attention
of
the
lover
produce
a
craving
for
their
return
;
and
he
be
soon
afterwards
able
to
account
for
his
not
yet
completely
and
indubitably
see
all
this
,
by
the
prospect
of
another
visitor
,
whose
approach
he
could
allow
to
be
quite
enough
to
support
the
spirit
he
be
watch
.
<EOS>
William
have
obtain
a
ten
day
'
leave
of
absence
,
to
be
give
to
Northamptonshire
,
and
be
come
,
the
happy
of
lieutenant
,
because
the
late
make
,
to
shew
his
happiness
and
describe
his
uniform
.
  
<EOS>
He
come
;
and
he
would
have
be
delight
to
shew
his
uniform
there
too
,
have
not
cruel
custom
prohibit
its
appearance
except
on
duty
.
<EOS>
so
the
uniform
remain
at
Portsmouth
,
and
Edmund
conjecture
that
before
Fanny
have
any
chance
of
see
it
,
all
its
own
freshness
and
all
the
freshness
of
its
wearer
's
feeling
must
be
wear
away
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
sink
into
a
badge
of
disgrace
;
for
what
can
be
more
unbecoming
,
or
more
worthless
,
than
the
uniform
of
a
lieutenant
,
who
have
be
a
lieutenant
a
year
or
two
,
and
see
other
make
commander
before
him
?
<EOS>
so
reason
Edmund
,
till
his
father
make
him
the
confidant
of
a
scheme
which
place
Fanny
's
chance
of
see
the
second
lieutenant
of
H.M.S.
Thrush
in
all
his
glory
in
another
light
.
  
<EOS>
this
scheme
be
that
she
should
accompany
her
brother
back
to
Portsmouth
,
and
spend
a
little
time
with
her
own
family
.
<EOS>
It
have
occur
to
Sir
Thomas
,
in
one
of
his
dignified
musing
,
as
a
right
and
desirable
measure
;
but
before
he
absolutely
make
up
his
mind
,
he
consult
his
son
.
<EOS>
Edmund
consider
it
every
way
,
and
see
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
be
right
.
<EOS>
the
thing
be
good
in
itself
,
and
could
not
be
do
at
a
well
time
;
and
he
have
no
doubt
of
it
be
highly
agreeable
to
Fanny
.
<EOS>
this
be
enough
to
determine
Sir
Thomas
;
and
a
decisive
"
then
so
it
shall
be
"
close
that
stage
of
the
business
;
Sir
Thomas
retire
from
it
with
some
feeling
of
satisfaction
,
and
view
of
good
over
and
above
what
he
have
communicate
to
his
son
;
for
his
prime
motive
in
send
her
away
have
very
little
to
do
with
the
propriety
of
her
see
her
parent
again
,
and
nothing
at
all
with
any
idea
of
make
her
happy
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
wish
her
to
go
willingly
,
but
he
as
certainly
wish
her
to
be
heartily
sick
of
home
before
her
visit
end
;
and
that
a
little
abstinence
from
the
elegancie
and
luxury
of
Mansfield
Park
would
bring
her
mind
into
a
sober
state
,
and
incline
her
to
a
juster
estimate
of
the
value
of
that
home
of
great
permanence
,
and
equal
comfort
,
of
which
she
have
the
offer
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
medicinal
project
upon
his
niece
's
understanding
,
which
he
must
consider
as
at
present
disease
.
<EOS>
a
residence
of
eight
or
nine
year
in
the
abode
of
wealth
and
plenty
have
a
little
disorder
her
power
of
compare
and
judging
.
<EOS>
Her
father
's
house
would
,
in
all
probability
,
teach
her
the
value
of
a
good
income
;
and
he
trust
that
she
would
be
the
wise
and
happy
woman
,
all
her
life
,
for
the
experiment
he
have
devise
.
  
<EOS>
have
Fanny
be
at
all
addict
to
rapture
,
she
must
have
have
a
strong
attack
of
them
when
she
first
understand
what
be
intend
,
when
her
uncle
first
make
her
the
offer
of
visit
the
parent
,
and
brother
,
and
sister
,
from
whom
she
have
be
divide
almost
half
her
life
;
of
return
for
a
couple
of
month
to
the
scene
of
her
infancy
,
with
William
for
the
protector
and
companion
of
her
journey
,
and
the
certainty
of
continue
to
see
William
to
the
last
hour
of
his
remain
on
land
.
<EOS>
have
she
ever
give
way
to
burst
of
delight
<EOS>
,
it
must
have
be
then
,
for
she
be
delighted
,
but
her
happiness
be
of
a
quiet
,
deep
,
heart
-
swell
sort
;
and
though
never
a
great
talker
,
she
be
always
more
inclined
to
silence
when
feel
most
strongly
.
<EOS>
at
the
moment
she
could
only
thank
and
accept
.
<EOS>
afterwards
,
when
familiarise
with
the
vision
of
enjoyment
so
suddenly
open
,
she
could
speak
more
largely
to
William
and
Edmund
of
what
she
feel
;
but
still
there
be
emotion
of
tenderness
that
could
not
be
clothe
in
word
.
<EOS>
the
remembrance
of
all
her
early
pleasure
,
and
of
what
she
have
suffer
in
be
tear
from
them
,
come
over
her
with
renew
strength
,
and
it
seem
as
if
to
be
at
home
again
would
heal
every
pain
that
have
since
grow
out
of
the
separation
.
<EOS>
to
be
in
the
centre
of
such
a
circle
,
love
by
so
many
,
and
more
love
by
all
than
she
have
ever
be
before
;
to
feel
affection
without
fear
or
restraint
;
to
feel
herself
the
equal
of
those
who
surround
her
;
to
be
at
peace
from
all
mention
of
the
Crawfords
,
safe
from
every
look
which
could
be
fancy
a
reproach
on
their
account
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
prospect
to
be
dwell
on
with
a
fondness
that
could
be
but
half
acknowledge
.
  
<EOS>
Edmund
,

month
from

him

<EOS>
(
and
perhaps
she
may
be
allow
to
make
her
absence
three
)
must
do
her
good
.
<EOS>
at
a
distance
,
unassaile
by
his
look
or
his
kindness
,
and
safe
from
the
perpetual
irritation
of
know
his
heart
,
and
strive
to
avoid
his
confidence
,
she
should
be
able
to
reason
herself
into
a
properer
state
;
she
should
be
able
to
think
of
him
as
in
London
,
and
arrange
everything
there
,
without
wretchedness
.
<EOS>
what
may
have
be
hard
to
bear
at
Mansfield
be
to
become
a
slight
evil
at
Portsmouth
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
drawback
be
the
doubt
of
her
aunt
Bertram
's
be
comfortable
without
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
of
use
to
no
one
else
;
but
_
there
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
she
may
be
miss
to
a
degree
that
she
do
not
like
to
think
of
;
and
that
part
of
the
arrangement
be
,
indeed
,
the
hard
for
Sir
Thomas
to
accomplish
,
and
what
only
_
he
_
could
have
accomplish
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
be
master
at
Mansfield
Park
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
really
resolve
on
any
measure
,
he
could
always
carry
it
through
;
and
now
by
dint
of
long
talk
on
the
subject
,
explain
and
dwell
on
the
duty
of
Fanny
's
sometimes
see
her
family
,
he
do
induce
his
wife
to
let
her
go
;
obtain
it
rather
from
submission
,
however
,
than
conviction
,
for
Lady
Bertram
be
convince
of
very
little
more
than
that
Sir
Thomas
think
Fanny
ought
to
go
,
and
therefore
that
she
must
.
<EOS>
in
the
calmness
of
her
own
dressing
-
room
,
in
the
impartial
flow
of
her
own
meditation
,
unbiasse
by
his
bewilder
statement
,
she
could
not
acknowledge
any
necessity
for
Fanny
's
ever
go
near
a
father
and
mother
who
have
do
without
her
so
long
,
while
she
be
so
useful
to
herself
.
<EOS>
and
as
to
the
not
miss
her
,
which
under
Mrs.
Norris
's
discussion
be
the
point
attempt
to
be
prove
,
she
set
herself
very
steadily
against
admit
any
such
thing
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
have
appeal
to
her
reason
,
conscience
,
and
dignity
.
<EOS>
He
call
it
a
sacrifice
,
and
demand
it
of
her
goodness
and
self
-
command
as
such
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Norris
want
to
persuade
her
that
Fanny
could
be
very
well
spare
 
_
<EOS>
she
_
be
ready
to
give
up
all
her
own
time
to
her
as
request
 
and
,
<EOS>
in
short
,
could
not
really
be
want
or
miss
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
may
be
,
sister
,
"
be
all
Lady
Bertram
's
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
you
be
very
right
;
but
I
be
sure
I
shall
miss
her
very
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
next
step
be
to
communicate
with
Portsmouth
.
<EOS>
Fanny
write
to
offer
herself
;
and
her
mother
's
answer
,
though
short
,
be
so
kind
 
<EOS>
a
few
simple
line
express
so
natural
and
motherly
<EOS>
a
joy
in
the
prospect
of
see
her
child
again
,
as
to
confirm
all
the
daughter
's
view
of
happiness
in
be
with
her
 
convince
her
that
she
should
now
find
a
warm
and
affectionate
friend
in
the
"
mama
"
who
have
certainly
shew
no
remarkable
fondness
for
her
formerly
;
but
this
<EOS>
she
could
easily
suppose
to
have
be
her
own
fault
or
her
own
fancy
.
<EOS>
She
have
probably
alienate
love
by
the
helplessness
and
fretfulness
of
a
fearful
temper
,
or
be
unreasonable
in
want
a
large
share
than
any
one
among
so
many
could
deserve
.
<EOS>
now
,
when
she
know
better
how
to
be
useful
,
and
how
to
forbear
,
and
when
her
mother
could
be
no
longer
occupy
by
the
incessant
demand
of
a
house
full
of
little
child
,
there
would
be
leisure
and
inclination
for
every
comfort
,
and
they
should
soon
be
what
mother
and
daughter
ought
to
be
to
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
William
be
almost
as
happy
in
the
plan
as
his
sister
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
the
great
pleasure
to
him
to
have
her
there
to
the
last
moment
before
he
sail
,
and
perhaps
find
her
there
still
when
he
come
in
from
his
first
cruise
.
<EOS>
and
besides
,
he
want
her
so
very
much
to
see
the
Thrush
before
she
go
out
of
harbour
 
<EOS>
the
Thrush
be
certainly
the
fine
sloop
in
the
service
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
several
improvement
in
the
dockyard
,
too
,
which
he
quite
long
to
shew
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
scruple
to
add
that
her
be
at
home
for
a
while
<EOS>
would
be
a
great
advantage
to
everybody
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
how
it
be
,
"
say
he
;
"
but
we
seem
to
want
some
of
your
nice
way
and
orderliness
at
my
father
's
.
<EOS>
the
house
be
always
in
confusion
.
<EOS>
You
will
set
thing
go
in
a
well
way
,
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
You
will
tell
my
mother
how
it
all
ought
to
be
,
and
you
will
be
so
useful
to
Susan
,
and
you
will
teach
Betsey
,
and
make
the
boy
love
and
mind
you
.
<EOS>
how
right
and
comfortable
it
will
all
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
by
the
time
Mrs.
Price
's
answer
arrive
,
there
remain
but
a
very
few
day
more
to
be
spend
at
Mansfield
;
and
for
part
of
one
of
those
day
the
young
traveller
be
in
a
good
deal
of
alarm
on
the
subject
of
their
journey
,
for
when
the
mode
of
it
come
to
be
talk
of
,
and
Mrs.
Norris
find
that
all
her
anxiety
to
save
her
brother
-
<EOS>
in
-
law
's
money
be
vain
,
and
that
in
spite
of
her
wish
and
hint
for
a
less
expensive
conveyance
of
Fanny
,
they
be
to
travel
post
;
when
she
see
Sir
Thomas
actually
give
William
note
for
the
purpose
,
she
be
strike
with
the
idea
of
there
be
room
for
a
third
in
the
carriage
,
and
suddenly
seize
with
a
strong
inclination
to
go
with
them
,
to
go
and
see
her
poor
dear
sister
Price
.
<EOS>
She
proclaim
her
thought
.
<EOS>
She
must
say
that
she
have
more
than
half
a
mind
to
go
with
the
young
people
;
it
would
be
such
an
indulgence
to
her
;
she
have
not
see
her
poor
dear
sister
price
for
more
than
twenty
year
;
and
it
would
be
a
help
to
the
young
people
in
their
journey
to
have
her
old
head
to
manage
for
them
;
and
she
could
not
help
think
her
poor
dear
sister
Price
would
feel
it
very
unkind
of
her
not
to
come
by
such
an
opportunity
.
  
<EOS>
William
and
Fanny
be
horror
-
strike
at
the
idea
.
  
<EOS>
all
the
comfort
of
their
comfortable
journey
would
be
destroy
at
once
.
<EOS>
with
woeful
countenance
they
look
at
each
other
.
<EOS>
Their
suspense
last
an
hour
or
two
.
<EOS>
no
one
interfere
to
encourage
or
dissuade
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
be
leave
to
settle
the
matter
by
herself
;
and
it
end
,
to
the
infinite
joy
of
her
nephew
and
niece
,
in
the
recollection
that
she
could
not
possibly
be
spare
from
Mansfield
Park
at
present
;
that
she
be
a
great
deal
too
necessary
to
Sir
Thomas
and
Lady
Bertram
for
her
to
be
able
to
answer
it
to
herself
to
leave
them
even
for
a
week
,
and
therefore
must
certainly
sacrifice
every
other
pleasure
to
that
of
be
useful
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
,
in
fact
,
occur
to
her
,
that
though
take
to
Portsmouth
for
nothing
,
it
would
be
hardly
possible
for
her
to
avoid
pay
her
own
expense
back
again
.
<EOS>
so
her
poor
dear
sister
Price
be
leave
to
all
the
disappointment
of
her
miss
such
an
opportunity
,
and
another
twenty
year
'
absence
,
perhaps
,
begin
.
  
<EOS>
Edmund
's
plan
be
affect
by
this
Portsmouth
journey
,
this
absence
of
Fanny
's
.
<EOS>
He
too
have
a
sacrifice
to
make
to
Mansfield
Park
as
well
as
his
aunt
.
<EOS>
He
have
intend
,
about
this
time
,
to
be
go
to
London
;
but
he
could
not
leave
his
father
and
mother
just
when
everybody
else
of
most
importance
to
their
comfort
be
leave
them
;
and
with
an
effort
,
feel
but
not
boast
of
<EOS>
,
he
delay
for
a
week
or
two
long
a
journey
which
he
be
look
forward
to
with
the
hope
of
its
fix
his
happiness
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
Fanny
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
know
so
much
already
,
that
she
must
know
everything
.
<EOS>
It
make
the
substance
of
one
other
confidential
discourse
about
Miss
Crawford
;
and
Fanny
be
the
more
affected
from
feel
it
to
be
the
last
time
in
which
Miss
Crawford
's
name
would
ever
be
mention
between
them
with
any
remain
of
liberty
.
<EOS>
once
afterwards
she
be
allude
to
by
him
.
<EOS>
Lady
Bertram
have
be
tell
her
niece
in
the
evening
to
write
to
her
soon
and
often
,
and
promise
to
be
a
good
correspondent
herself
;
and
Edmund
,
at
a
convenient
moment
,
then
add
in
a
whisper
,
"
<EOS>
and
_
I
_
shall
write
to
you
,
Fanny
,
when
I
have
anything
worth
write
about
,
anything
to
say
that
I
think
you
will
like
to
hear
,
and
that
you
will
not
hear
so
soon
from
any
other
quarter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
she
doubt
his
meaning
while
she
listen
,
the
glow
in
his
face
,
when
she
look
up
at
him
,
would
have
be
decisive
.
  
<EOS>
for
this
letter
she
must
try
to
arm
herself
.
<EOS>
that
a
letter
from
Edmund
should
be
a
subject
of
terror
!
<EOS>
She
begin
to
feel
that
she
have
not
yet
go
through
all
the
change
of
opinion
and
sentiment
which
the
progress
of
time
and
variation
of
circumstance
occasion
in
this
world
of
change
.
<EOS>
the
vicissitude
of
the
human
mind
have
not
yet
be
exhaust
by
her
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Fanny
!
<EOS>
though
go
as
she
do
willingly
and
eagerly
,
the
last
evening
at
Mansfield
Park
must
still
be
wretchedness
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
be
completely
sad
at
parting
.
<EOS>
She
have
tear
for
every
room
in
the
house
,
much
more
for
every
beloved
inhabitant
.
<EOS>
She
cling
to
her
aunt
,
because
she
would
miss
her
;
she
kiss
the
hand
of
her
uncle
with
struggle
sobs
,
because
she
have
displease
him
;
and
as
for
Edmund
,
she
could
neither
speak
,
nor
look
,
nor
think
,
when
the
last
moment
come
with
_
him
_
;
and
it
be
not
till
it
be
over
that
she
know
he
be
give
her
the
affectionate
farewell
of
a
brother
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
pass
overnight
,
for
the
journey
be
to
begin
very
early
in
the
morning
;
and
when
the
small
,
diminished
party
meet
at
breakfast
,
William
and
Fanny
be
talk
of
as
already
advance
one
stage
.
    
<EOS>
the
novelty
of
travel
,
and
the
happiness
of
be
with
William
,
soon
produce
their
natural
effect
on
Fanny
's
spirit
,
when
Mansfield
Park
be
fairly
leave
behind
;
and
by
the
time
their
first
stage
be
end
,
and
they
be
to
quit
Sir
Thomas
's
carriage
,
she
be
able
to
take
leave
of
the
old
coachman
,
and
send
back
proper
message
,
with
cheerful
look
.
  
<EOS>
of
pleasant
talk
between
the
brother
and
sister
there
be
no
end
.
<EOS>
everything
supply
an
amusement
to
the
high
glee
of
William
's
mind
,
and
he
be
full
of
frolic
and
joke
in
the
interval
of
their
high
-
tone
subject
,
all
of
which
end
,
if
they
do
not
begin
,
in
praise
of
the
Thrush
<EOS>
,
conjecture
how
she
would
be
employ
,
scheme
for
an
action
with
some
superior
force
,
which
(
suppose
the
first
lieutenant
out
of
the
way
,
and
William
be
not
very
merciful
to
the
first
lieutenant
)
be
to
give
himself
the
next
step
as
soon
as
possible
,
or
speculation
upon
prize
-
money
,
which
be
to
be
generously
distribute
at
home
,
with
only
the
reservation
of
enough
to
make
the
little
cottage
comfortable
,
in
which
he
and
Fanny
be
to
pass
all
their
middle
and
later
life
together
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
's
immediate
concern
,
as
far
as
they
involve
Mr.
Crawford
,
make
no
part
of
their
conversation
.
<EOS>
William
know
what
have
pass
,
and
from
his
heart
lament
that
his
sister
's
feeling
should
be
so
cold
towards
a
man
whom
he
must
consider
as
the
first
of
human
character
;
but
he
be
of
an
age
to
be
all
for
love
,
and
therefore
unable
to
blame
;
and
know
her
wish
on
the
subject
,
he
would
not
distress
her
by
the
slight
allusion
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
reason
to
suppose
herself
not
yet
forget
by
Mr.
Crawford
.
<EOS>
She
have
hear
repeatedly
from
his
sister
within
the
three
week
which
have
pass
since
their
leave
Mansfield
,
and
in
each
letter
there
have
be
a
few
line
from
himself
,
warm
and
determined
like
his
speech
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
correspondence
which
Fanny
find
quite
as
unpleasant
as
she
have
fear
.
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
's
style
of
writing
,
lively
and
affectionate
,
be
itself
an
evil
,
independent
of
what
she
be
thus
force
into
reading
from
the
brother
's
pen
,
for
Edmund
would
never
rest
till
she
have
read
the
chief
of
the
letter
to
him
;
and
then
she
have
to
listen
to
his
admiration
of
her
language
,
and
the
warmth
of
her
attachment
.
<EOS>
there
have
,
in
fact
,
be
so
much
of
message
,
of
allusion
,
of
recollection
,
so
much
of
Mansfield
in
every
letter
,
that
Fanny
could
not
but
suppose
it
mean
for
him
to
hear
;
and
to
find
herself
force
into
a
purpose
of
that
kind
,
compel
into
a
correspondence
which
be
bring
her
the
address
of
the
man
she
do
not
love
,
and
oblige
her
to
administer
to
the
adverse
passion
of
the
man
she
do
,
be
cruelly
mortify
.
<EOS>
here
,
too
,
her
present
removal
promise
advantage
.
<EOS>
when
no
longer
under
the
same
roof
with
Edmund
,
she
trust
that
Miss
Crawford
would
have
no
motive
for
write
strong
enough
to
overcome
the
trouble
,
and
that
at
Portsmouth
their
correspondence
would
dwindle
into
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
with
such
thought
as
these
,
among
ten
hundred
other
,
Fanny
proceed
in
her
journey
safely
and
cheerfully
,
and
as
expeditiously
as
could
rationally
be
hope
in
the
dirty
month
of
February
.
<EOS>
They
enter
Oxford
,
but
she
could
take
only
a
hasty
glimpse
of
Edmund
's
college
as
they
pass
along
,
and
make
no
stop
anywhere
till
they
reach
Newbury
,
where
a
comfortable
meal
,

<EOS>
the

and

of
Portsmouth
while
there

<EOS>
They

and
enter
the

;
and
the
light

by
William

powerful
voice

by
Mr.
Price

<EOS>
Fanny

and
apprehension

<EOS>
the
moment
they
stop
,
a
trollopy
-
look
maidservant
,
seemingly
in
wait
for
them
at
the
door
,
step
forward
,
and
more
intent
on

than

,
immediately

with

She

of
eleven

,
who
,
rush

,

aside
,
and
while

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
It

a
beautiful
sight
.
<EOS>
and
they
think
she
will
have

a
day
or

.
<EOS>
and
Mr.

here
at
four
o'clock
to

and
hope

in
time
to

"
  
<EOS>
a
stare
or
two
at
Fanny
,
as
William
help
her
out
of
the
carriage
,
be
all
the
voluntary
notice
which
this
brother
bestow
;
but
he
make
no
objection
to
her
kiss
him
,
though
still
entirely
engage
in
detail
farth
particular
of
the
Thrush
's
go
out
of
harbour
,
in
which
he
have
a
strong
right
of
interest
,
be
to
commence
his
career
of
seamanship
in
her
at
this
very
time
.
  
<EOS>
another
moment
and
Fanny
be
in
the
narrow
entrance
-
passage
of
the
house
,
and
in
her
mother
's
arm
,
who
meet
her
there
with
look
of
true
kindness
,
and
with
feature
which
Fanny
love
the
more
,
because
they
bring
her
aunt
Bertram
's
before
her
,
and
there
be
her
two
sister
:
Susan
,
a
well
-
grow
fine
girl
of
fourteen
,
and
Betsey
,
the
young
of
the
family
,
about
five
 
both
glad
to
see
her
in
their
way
,
though
with
no
advantage
of
manner
in
receive
her
.
<EOS>
but
manner
Fanny
do
not
want
.
<EOS>
Would
they
but
love
her
,
she
should
be
satisfied
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
then
take
into
a
parlour
,
so
small
that
her
first
conviction
be
of
its
be
only
a
passage
-
room
to
something
well
,
and
she
stand
for
a
moment
expect
to
be
invite
on
;
but
when
she
see
there
be
no
other
door
,
and
that
there
be
sign
of
habitation
before
her
,
she
call
back
her
thought
,
reprove
herself
,
and
grieve
lest
they
should
have
be
suspect
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
,
however
,
could
not
stay
long
enough
to
suspect
anything
.
<EOS>
She
be
go
again
to
the
street
-
door
,
to
welcome
William
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
my
dear
William
,
how
glad
I
be
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
but
have
you
hear
about
the
Thrush
?
<EOS>
She
be
go
out
of
harbour
already
;
three
day
before
we
have
any
thought
of
it
;
and
I
do
not
know
what
I
be
to
do
about
Sam
's
thing
,
they
will
never
be
ready
in
time
;
for
she
may
have
her
order
to
-
morrow
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
It
take
me
quite
unawares
.
<EOS>
and
now
you
must
be
off
for
Spithead
too
.
<EOS>
Campbell
have
be
here
,
quite
in
a
worry
about
you
;
and
now
what
shall
we
do
?
<EOS>
I
think
to
have
have
such
a
comfortable
evening
with
you
,
and
here
everything
come
upon
me
at
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
son
answer
cheerfully
,
tell
her
that
everything
be
always
for
the
good
;
and
make
light
of
his
own
inconvenience
in
be
oblige
to
hurry
away
so
soon
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
,
I
have
much
rather
she
have
stay
in
harbour
,
<EOS>
that
I
may
have
sit
a
few
hour
with
you
in
comfort
;
but
as
there
be
a
boat
ashore
,
I
have
better
go
off
at
once
,
and
there
be
no
help
for
it
.
<EOS>
Whereabouts
do
the
Thrush
lie
at
Spithead
?
<EOS>
near
the
Canopus
?
<EOS>
but
no
matter
;
here
be
Fanny
in
the
parlour
,
and
why
should
we
stay
in
the
passage
?
<EOS>
come
,
mother
,
you
have
hardly
look
at
your
own
dear
Fanny
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
they
both
come
,
and
Mrs.
Price
have
kindly
kiss
her
daughter
again
,
and
comment
a
little
on
her
growth
,
begin
with
very
natural
solicitude
to
feel
for
their
fatigue
and
want
as
traveller
.
  
<EOS>
"
poor
dear
!
<EOS>
how
tired
you
must
both
be
!
<EOS>
and
now
,
what
will
you
have
?
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
you
would
never
come
.
<EOS>
Betsey
and
I
have
be
watch
for
you
this
half
-
hour
.
<EOS>
and
when
do
you
get
anything
to
eat
?
<EOS>
and
what
would
you
like
to
have
now
?
<EOS>
I
could
not
tell
whether
you
would
be
for
some
meat
,
or
only
a
dish
of
tea
,
after
your
journey
,
or
else
I
would
have
get
something
ready
.
<EOS>
and
now
I
be
afraid
Campbell
will
be
here
before
there
be
time
to
dress
a
steak
,
and
we
have
no
butcher
at
hand
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
inconvenient
to
have
no
butcher
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
We
be
well
off
in
our
last
house
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
would
like
some
tea
as
soon
as
it
can
be
get
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
both
declare
they
should
prefer
it
to
anything
.
"
<EOS>
then
,
Betsey
,
my
dear
,
run
into
the
kitchen
and
see
if
Rebecca
have
put
the
water
on
;
and
tell
her
to
bring
in
the
tea
-
thing
as
soon
as
she
can
.
<EOS>
I
wish
we
could
get
the
bell
mend
;
but
Betsey
be
a
very
handy
little
messenger
.
"
  
<EOS>
Betsey
go
with
alacrity
,
proud
to
shew
her
ability
before
her
fine
new
sister
.
  
<EOS>
"
dear
me
!
"
continue
the
anxious
mother
,
"
what
a
sad
fire
we
have
get
,
and
I
dare
say
you
be
both
starve
with
cold
.
<EOS>
draw
your
chair
nearer
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
think
what
Rebecca
have
be
about
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
tell
her
to
bring
some
coal
half
an
hour
ago
.
<EOS>
Susan
,
you
should
have
take
care
of
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
upstairs
,
mama
,
move
my
thing
,
"
say
Susan
,
in
a
fearless
,
self
-
defend
tone
,
which
startle
Fanny
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
you
have
but
just
settle
that
my
sister
Fanny
<EOS>
and
I
should
have
the
other
room
;
and
I
could
not
get
Rebecca
to
give
me
any
help
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Farther
discussion
be
prevent
by
various
bustle
:
first
,
the
driver
come
to
be
pay
;
then
there
be
a
squabble
between
Sam
and
Rebecca
about
the
manner
of
carry
up
his
sister
's
trunk
,
which
he
would
manage
all
his
own
way
;
and
lastly
,
in
walk
Mr.
Price
himself
,
his
own
loud
voice
precede
him
,
as
with
something
of
the
oath
kind
he
kick
away
his
son
's
port
-
manteau
and
his
daughter
's
bandbox
in
the
passage
,
and
call
out
for
a
candle
;
no
candle
be
bring
,
however
,
and
he
walk
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
with
doubt
feeling
have
rise
to
meet
him
,
but
sink
down
again
on
find
herself
undistinguished
in
the
dusk
,
and
unthought
of
.
<EOS>
with
a
friendly
shake
of
his
son
's
hand
,
and
an
eager
voice
,
he
instantly
begin
 
"

<EOS>
Sharp

<EOS>
the

and

so

with
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
to
Turner
be
about
your
mess
;
it
be
all
in
a
way
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
wonder
if
you
have
your
order
to
-
morrow
:
but
you
can
not
sail
with
this
wind
,
if
you
be
to
cruise
to
the
westward
;
and
Captain
Walsh
think
you
will
certainly
have
a
cruise
to
the
westward
,
with
the
Elephant
.
<EOS>
by
G
 
,
I
wish

<EOS>
but

<EOS>
well

<EOS>
but

<EOS>
I
would
not

thousand
pound

<EOS>
Old
Scholey

at
breakfast

<EOS>
if
ever
there
be
a
perfect
beauty
afloat
,
she

one

and
there
she
lay
at
Spithead

and
anybody
in
England

and
-
twenty
.
<EOS>
I
be
upon
the
platform
two
hour
this
afternoon

<EOS>
She
lay
close
to
the
endymion
,
between

just

cry
William

<EOS>
that

just

I
should

<EOS>
It

the
good
berth
at
Spithead
.
<EOS>
but
here
be
my
sister
,
sir
;
here
be
Fanny
,
"
turn
and
lead
her
forward
;
"
it
be
so
dark
you

her
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
an
acknowledgment
that
he
have
quite
forget
her
,
Mr.
Price
now
receive
his
daughter
;
and
have
give
her
a
cordial
hug
,
and
observe
that
she
be
grow
into
a
woman
,
and
he
suppose
would
be
want
a
husband
soon
,
seem
very
much
inclined
to
forget
her
again
.
<EOS>
Fanny
shrink
back
to
her
seat
,
with
feeling
sadly
pain
by
his
language
and
his
smell
of
spirit
;
and
he
talk
on
only
to
his
son
,
and
only
of
the
Thrush
,
though
William
,
warmly
interested
as
he
be
in
that
subject
,
more
than
once
try
to
make
his
father
think
of
Fanny
,
and
her
long
absence
and
long
journey
.
  
<EOS>
after
sit
some
time
longer
,
a
candle
be
obtain
;
but
as
there
be
still
no
appearance
of
tea
,
nor
,
from
Betsey

report
from
the
kitchen
,
much
hope
of
any

a
considerable
period

William
determine
to
go
and
change
his
dress
,
and
make
the
necessary
preparation
for
his
removal
on
board
directly
,
that
he
may
have
his
tea
in
comfort
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
as

<EOS>

the
feature
of
the
baby

of
his
infant
preference
of
herself

<EOS>
Tom

for
such
treatment
:
he

home
not

but
to

;
and
both

Mrs.

thinness

close

add
to
the
fatigue

all
her

she

_
<EOS>
within

for
Susan

there

and
<EOS>
he

the

the

she

She

what

she

<EOS>
She

<EOS>
William

one
subject
swallow
up
all
the

<EOS>
perhaps
it
must
be
so
.
<EOS>
the
destination
of
the
Thrush

preeminently
interesting

<EOS>
a

two
may
shew
the

<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She

be
to
blame

<EOS>
yet
she
think
it
would
not
have
be
so
at
Mansfield

<EOS>
no
,
in
her
uncle

house
there
would
have

a
regulation
of
subject

a
propriety

an
attention
towards
everybody

<EOS>
the
only
interruption
which
thought
like
these
receive
for
nearly
half
an
hour
be
from
a
sudden
burst
of
her
father

not

<EOS>
at
a
more
than
ordinary
pitch

"
Devil

that
though
within
five
minute
afterwards
the
three

all
burst
into
the
room
together
and
sit
down
,
Fanny
could
not
consider
it
as
a
proof
of
anything
more
than
their
being
for
the
time
thoroughly
fag
,
which
their
hot
face
and
pant
breath
seem
to
prove
,
especially
as
they
be
still
kick

shin

halloo
out
at
sudden
start
immediately
under
their

the
next
opening

bring
something
<EOS>
more

<EOS>
:
it

to

that

Susan
look

as

fire
and
glance
at

as

triumph

the
dread

by
such
an
office

<EOS>
She
have
be
into
the
kitchen

"
she
say
,
"
to
hurry
Sally
and
help
make
the
toast
,
and
spread
the
bread
and
butter
,
or
she
do
not
know
when
they
should
have
get
tea
,
and
she
be
sure
her
sister
must
want
something
after
her
journey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
be
very
thankful
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
but
own
that
she
should
be
very
glad
of
a
little
tea
,
and
Susan
immediately
set
about
make
it
,
as
if
pleased
to
have
the
employment
all
to
herself
;
and
with
only
a
little
unnecessary
bustle
,
and
some
few
injudicious
attempt
at

her
brother
in
well
order
than
she
could

acquit
herself
very
well

<EOS>
Fanny

<EOS>
Susan

an
open

sensible
countenance

she
be
like
William

and
Fanny
hope
to
find
her
like

in
disposition

goodwill
towards

<EOS>
in
this
more
placid
state
of

William

follow
not
far
behind

his
mother
and
Betsey

<EOS>
He

look

move
all
the

and
more

and
with
the
happy
smile
over
his
face
,
walk
up
directly
to
Fanny
,
who
,
rise
from
her
seat
,
look
at
him
for
a
moment
in
speechless
admiration
,
and
then
throw
her
arm
round
his
neck
to
sob
out
her
various
emotion
of
pain
and
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
anxious
not

appear
unhappy

recover
herself
;
and
wipe
away
her
tear

be
able
to
notice
and
admire
all
the
striking

some
part

before

and
with
some
hasty
washing
of
the
young

William

entreaty

sally

and
Mr.
Price
walk
off
at
the
same
time
to
carry
back
his
neighbour

newspaper

<EOS>
something
like
tranquillity
may
now
be
hope
for
;
and
accordingly
,
when
Rebecca
have
be
prevail
on
to
carry
away
the
tea
-
thing
,
and
Mrs.
Price
have
walk
about
the
room
some
time
look
for
a
shirt

sleeve
,
which
Betsey
at
last
hunt
out
from
a
drawer
in
the
kitchen

the
small
party
of
female

pretty
well
compose

and
the
mother
have
lament
again
over
the
impossibility

get
Sam
ready
in
time

be
at
leisure
to
think
of
her
eld
daughter
and
the
friend
she
have
come
from
.
  
<EOS>
a
few
inquiry
begin
:
but
one
of
the
early
 
<EOS>
"
how
do
sister
Bertram
manage
about
her
servant
?
"
<EOS>
"
be
she
as
much
plague
as
herself
to
get
tolerable
servant
?
"
 
soon
lead
her
mind
away
from
Northamptonshire
,
and
fix
it
on
her
own
domestic
grievance
,
and
the
shocking
character
of
all
the
Portsmouth
servant
,
of
whom
she
believe
her
own
two
be
the
very
bad
,
engross
her
completely
.
<EOS>
the
Bertrams
be
all
forget
in
detail
the
fault
of
Rebecca
,
against
whom
Susan
have
also
much
to
depose
,
and
little
Betsey
a
great
deal
more
,
and
who
do
seem
so
thoroughly
without
a
single
recommendation
,
that
Fanny
could
not
help
modestly
presume
that
her
mother
mean
to
part
with
her
when
her
year
be
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
Her
year
!
"
cry
Mrs.
Price
;
"
I
be
sure
I
hope
I
shall
be
rid
of
her
before
she
have
staid
a
year
,
<EOS>
for
that
will
not
be
up
till
November
.
<EOS>
servant
be
come
to
such
a
pass
,
my
dear
,
in
Portsmouth
,
that
it
be
quite
a
miracle
if
one
keep
them
more
than
half
a
year
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
hope
of
ever
be
settle
;
and
if
I
be
to
part
with
Rebecca
,
I
should
only
get
something
bad
.
<EOS>
and
yet
I
do
not
think
I
be
a
very
difficult
mistress
to
please
;
and
I
be
sure
the
place
be
easy
enough
,
for
there
be
always
a
girl
under
her
,
and
I
often
do
half
the
work
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
be
silent
;
but
not
from
be
convince
that
there
may
not
be
a
remedy
find
for
some
of
these
evil
.
<EOS>
as
she
now
sit
look
at
Betsey
,
she
could
not
but
think
particularly
of
another
sister
,
a
very
pretty
little
girl
,
whom
she
have
leave
there
not
much
young
when
she
go
into
Northamptonshire
,
who
have
die
a
few
year
afterwards
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
something
remarkably
amiable
about
her
.
<EOS>
Fanny
in
those
early
day
have
prefer
her
to
Susan
;
and
when
the
news
of
her
death
have
at
last
reach
Mansfield
,
have
for
a
short
time
be
quite
afflict
.
<EOS>
the
sight
of
Betsey
bring
the
image
of
little
Mary
back
again
,
but
she
would
not
have
pain
her
mother
by
allude
to
her
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
while
consider
her
with
these
idea
,
Betsey
,
at
a
small
distance
,
be
hold
out
something
to
catch
her
eye
,
mean
to
screen
it
at
the
same
time
from
Susan
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
have
you
get
there
,
my
love
?
"
<EOS>
say
Fanny
;
"
come
and
shew
it
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
silver
knife
.
<EOS>
up
jump
Susan
,
claim
it
as
her
own
,
and
try
to
get
it
away
;
but
the
child
run
to
her
mother
's
protection
,
and
Susan
could
only
reproach
,
which
she
do
very
warmly
,
and
evidently
hope
to
interest
Fanny
on
her
side
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
hard
that
she
be
not
to
have
her
_
own
_
knife
;
it
be
her
own
knife
;
little
sister
Mary
have
leave
it
to
her
upon
her
deathbed
,
and
she
ought
to
have
have
it
to
keep
herself
long
ago

<EOS>
but
mama
keep
it
from
her
,
and
be
always
let
Betsey
get
hold
of
it
;
and
the
end
of
it
would
be
that
Betsey
would
spoil
it
,
and
get
it
for
her
own

though

her
that
Betsey

<EOS>
Fanny
be
quite
shocked

<EOS>
every
feeling
of
duty
,
honour
,
and
tenderness
be
wound
by
her
sister
's
speech
and
her

reply

"

cry
Mrs.

in
a
complaining
voice

"
<EOS>
now

You

you

out

my

You
know
I
tell
you
not

so
cross
about

I
must
hide
it
another

poor

fond

indeed
nothing
to

from

a
message
to
say
she
hope
that
her
god

daughter
be
a
good
girl

learn
her
book

<EOS>
there
have
be
at
one
moment
a
slight
murmur
in
the
drawing

room
at
Mansfield
Park
about
send
her
a
prayer
-
book
;
but
no
second
sound
have

such
a
purpose

<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
,
however
,
have
go
home
and
take
down
two
old
prayer

book
of
her
husband
with
that
idea

,
upon
examination
,
the
ardour
of
generosity
go
off

one
be
find
to
have
too
small
a
print
for
a
child

eye
,
and
the
other
to
be
too
cumbersome
for
her
to
carry
about

<EOS>
Fanny
,
fatigue
and
fatigue
again

be
thankful
to
accept
the
first
invitation
of

to

before
Betsey

finish
her
cry

only
one
hour
extraordinary
in

off

call
out

Rebecca
never

there
be
nothing
to
raise
her
spirit
in
the

scantily

the
smallness
of
the

above

below

indeed
,
and
the
narrowness
of
the
passage
and
staircase

strike
her
beyond

She
soon
learn
to
think
with
respect
of
her

little
attic
at
Mansfield
Park

school

Sam
on
some
project
of
his
own
,
and
her
father
on
his
usual
lounge
,
enable
her
to
express
herself
cheerfully
on
the
subject
of
home
,
there
be
still

to
her
own
perfect
consciousness

many
drawback
suppress

<EOS>
Could
he
have
see
only
half
that
she
feel
before
the
end
of
a
week
,
he
would
have
think
Mr.
Crawford
sure
of
her
,
and
be
delighted
with
his
own
sagacity
.
  
<EOS>
before
the
week
end
,
it
be
all
disappointment
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
William
be
go
.
<EOS>
the
Thrush
have
have
her
order
,
the
wind
have
change
,
and
he
be
sail
within
four
day
from
their
reach
Portsmouth
;
and
during
those
day
she
have
see
him
only
twice
,
in
a
short
and
hurried
way
,
when
he
have
come
ashore
on
duty
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
no
free
conversation
,
no
walk
on
the
rampart
,
no
visit
to
the
dockyard
,
no
acquaintance
with
the
Thrush
,
nothing
of
all
that
they
have
plan
and
depend
on
.
<EOS>
everything
in
that
quarter
fail
her
,
except
William
's
affection
.
<EOS>
His
last
thought
on
leave
home
be
for
her
.
<EOS>
He
step
back
again
to
the
door
to
say
,
"
take
care
of
Fanny
,
mother
.
<EOS>
She
be
tender
,
and
not
use
to
rough
it
like
the
rest
of
us
.
<EOS>
I
charge
you
,
take
care
of
Fanny
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
William
be
go
:
and
the
home
he
have
leave
her
in
be
<EOS>
,
Fanny
could
not
conceal
it
from
herself
,
in
almost
every
respect
the
very
reverse
of
what
she
could
have
wish
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
abode
of
noise
,
disorder
,
and
impropriety
.
<EOS>
nobody
be
in
their
right
place
,
nothing
be
do
as
it
ought
to
be
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
respect
her
parent
as
she
have
hope
.
<EOS>
on
her
father
,
her
confidence
have
not
be
sanguine
,
but
he
be
more
negligent
of
his
family
,
his
habit
be
bad
,
and
his
manner
coarser
,
than
she
have
be
prepare
for
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
want
ability
but
he
have
no
curiosity
,
and
no
information
beyond
his
profession
;
he
read
only
the
newspaper
and
the
navy
-
list
;
he
talk
only
of
the
dockyard
,
the
harbour
,
Spithead
,
and
the
Motherbank
;
he
swear
and
he
drink
,
he
be
dirty
and
gross
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
be
able
to
recall
anything
approach
to
tenderness
in
his
former
treatment
of
herself
.
<EOS>
there
have
remain
only
a
general
impression
of
roughness
and
loudness
;
and
now
he
scarcely
ever
notice
her
,
but
to
make
her
the
object
of
a
coarse
joke
.
  
<EOS>
Her
disappointment
in
her
mother
be
great
:
<EOS>
_
there
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
she
have
hope
much
,
and
find
almost
nothing
.
<EOS>
every
flattering
scheme
of
be
of
consequence
to
her
soon
fall
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Price
be
not
unkind
;
but
,
instead
of
gain
on
her
affection
and
confidence
,
and
become
more
and
more
dear
,
her
daughter
never
meet
with
great
kindness
from
her
than
on
the
first
day
of
her
arrival
.
<EOS>
the
instinct
of
nature
be
soon
satisfy
,
and
Mrs.
Price
's
attachment
have
no
other
source
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
and
her
time
be
already
quite
full
;
she
have
neither
leisure
nor
affection
to
bestow
on
Fanny
.
<EOS>
Her
daughter
never
have
be
much
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
fond
of
her
son
,
especially
of
William
,
but
Betsey
be
the
first
of
her
girl
whom
she
have
ever
much
regard
.
<EOS>
to
her
she
be
most
injudiciously
indulgent
.
<EOS>
William
be
her
pride
;
Betsey
her
darling
;
and
John
,
Richard
,
Sam
,
Tom
,
and
Charles
occupy
all
the
rest
of
her
maternal
solicitude
,
alternately
her
worry
and
her
comfort
.
<EOS>
these
share
her
heart
:
her
time
be
give
chiefly
to
her
house
and
her
servant
.
<EOS>
Her
day
be
spend
in
a
kind
of
slow
bustle
;
all
be
busy
without
get
on
,
always
behindhand
and
lament
it
,
without
alter
her
way
;
wish
to
be
an
economist
,
without
contrivance
or
regularity
;
dissatisfy
with
her
servant
,
without
skill
to
make
them
well
,
and
whether
help
,
or
reprimanding
,
or
indulge
them
,
without
any
power
of
engage
their
respect
.
  
<EOS>
of
her
two
sister
,
Mrs.
Price
very
much
more
resemble
Lady
Bertram
than
Mrs.
Norris
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
manager
by
necessity
,
without
any
of
Mrs.
Norris
's
inclination
for
it
,
or
any
of
her
activity
.
<EOS>
Her
disposition
be
naturally
easy
and
indolent
,
like
Lady
Bertram
's
;
and
a
situation
of
similar
affluence
and
do
-
nothingness
would
have
be
much
more
suited
to
her
capacity
than
the
exertion
and
self
-
denial
of
the
one
which
her
imprudent
marriage
have
place
her
in
.
<EOS>
She
may
have
make
just
as
good
a
woman
of
consequence
as
Lady
Bertram
,
but
Mrs.
Norris
would
have
be
a
more
respectable
mother
of
nine
child
on
a
small
income
.
  
<EOS>
much
of
all
this
Fanny
<EOS>
could
not
but
be
sensible
of
.
<EOS>
She
may
scruple
to
make
use
of
the
word
,
but
she
must
and
do
feel
that
her
mother
be
a
partial
,
ill
-
judge
parent
,
a
dawdle
,
a
slattern
,
who
neither
teach
nor
restrain
her
child
,
whose
house
be
the
scene
of
mismanagement
and
discomfort
from
begin
to
end
,
and
who
have
no
talent
,
no
conversation
,
no
affection
towards
herself
;
no
curiosity
to
know
her
well
,
no
desire
of
her
friendship
,
and
no
inclination
for
her
company
that
could
lessen
her
sense
of
such
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
be
very
anxious
to
be
useful
,
and
not
to
appear
above
her
home
,
or
in
any
way
disqualify
or
disincline
,
by
her
foreign
education
,
from
contribute
her
help
to
its
comfort
,
and
therefore
set
about
work
for
Sam
immediately
;
and
by
work
early
and
late
,
with
perseverance
and
great
despatch
,
do
so
much
that
the
boy
be
ship
off
at
last
,
with
more
than
half
his
linen
ready
.
<EOS>
She
have
great
pleasure
in
feel
her
usefulness
,
but
could
not
conceive
how
they
would
have
manage
without
her
.
  
<EOS>
Sam
,
loud
and
overbearing
as
he
be
,
she
rather
regret
when
he
go
,
for
he
be
clever
and
intelligent
,
and
glad
to
be
employ
in
any
errand
in
the
town
;
and
though
spurn
the
remonstrance
of
Susan
,
give
as
they
be
,
though
very
reasonable
in
themselves
,
with
ill
-
timed
and
powerless
warmth
,
be
begin
to
be
influence
by
Fanny
's
service
and
gentle
persuasion
;
and
she
find
that
the
good
of
the
three
young
one
be
go
in
him
:
Tom
and
Charles
be
at
least
as
many
year
as
they
be
his
junior
distant
from
that
age
of
feeling
and
reason
,
which
may
suggest
the
expediency
of
make
friend
,
and
of
endeavour
to
be
less
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
Their
sister
soon
despair
of
make
the
small
impression
on
_
them
_
;
they
be
quite
untameable
by
any
mean
of
address
which
she
have
spirit
or
time
to
attempt
.
<EOS>
every
afternoon
bring
a
return
of
their
riotous
game
all
over
the
house
;
and
she
very
early
learn
to
sigh
at
the
approach
of
Saturday
's
constant
half
-
holiday
.
  
<EOS>
Betsey
,
too
,
a
spoiled
child
,
train
up
to
think
the
alphabet
her
great
enemy
,
leave
to
be
with
the
servant
at
her
pleasure
,
and
then
encourage
to
report
any
evil
of
them
,
she
be
almost
as
ready
to
despair
of
be
able
to
love
or
assist
;
and
of
Susan
's
temper
she
have
many
doubt
.
<EOS>
Her
continual
disagreement
with
her
mother
,
her
rash
squabble
with
Tom
and
Charles
,
and
petulance
with
Betsey
,
be
at
least
so
distress
to
Fanny
<EOS>
that
,
though
admit
they
be
by
no
mean
without
provocation
,
she
fear
the
disposition
that
could
push
them
to
such
length
must
be
far
from
amiable
,
and
from
afford
any
repose
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
home
which
be
to
put
Mansfield
out
of
her
head
,
and
teach
her
to
think
of
her
cousin
Edmund
with
moderate
feeling
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
she
could
think
of
nothing
but
Mansfield
,
its
beloved
inmate
,
its
happy
way
.
<EOS>
everything
where
she
now
be
in
full
contrast
to
it
.
<EOS>
the
elegance
,
propriety
,
regularity
,
harmony
,
and
perhaps
,
above
all
,
the
peace
and
tranquillity
of
Mansfield
,
be
bring
to
her
remembrance
every
hour
of
the
day
,
by
the
prevalence
of
everything
opposite
to
them
_
here
_
.
  
<EOS>
the
living
in
incessant
noise
be
,
to
a
frame
and
temper
delicate
and
nervous
like
Fanny
's
,
an
evil
which
no
superadde
elegance
or
harmony
could
have
entirely
atone
for
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
great
misery
of
all
.
<EOS>
at
Mansfield
,
no
sound
of
contention
,
no
raise
voice
,
no
abrupt
burst
,
no
tread
of
violence
,
be
ever
hear
;
all
proceed
in
a
regular
course
of
cheerful
orderliness
;
everybody
have
their
due
importance
;
everybody
's
feeling
be
consult
.
<EOS>
if
tenderness
could
be
ever
suppose
want
,
good
sense
and
good
breeding
supply
its
place
;
and
as
to
the
little
irritation
sometimes
introduce
by
aunt
Norris
,
they
be
short
,
they
be
trifle
,
they
be
as
a
drop
of
water
to
the
ocean
,
compare
with
the
ceaseless
tumult
of
her
present
abode
.
<EOS>
here
everybody
be
noisy
,
every
voice
be
loud
(
excepting
,
perhaps
,
her
mother
's
,
which
resemble
the
soft
monotony
of
Lady
Bertram
's
,
only
wear
into
fretfulness
)
.
<EOS>
whatever
be
want
be
halloo
for
,
and
the
servant
halloo
out
their
excuse
from
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
the
door
be
in
constant
banging
,
the
stair
be
never
at
rest
,
nothing
be
do
without
a
clatter
,
nobody
sit
still
,
and
nobody
could
command
attention
when
they
speak
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
review
of
the
two
house
,
as
they
appear
to
her
before
the
end
of
a
week
,
Fanny
be
tempt
to
apply
to
them
<EOS>
Dr.
Johnson
's
celebrated
judgment
as
to
matrimony
and
celibacy
,
and
say
,
that
though
Mansfield
Park
may
have
some
pain
,
Portsmouth
could
have
no
pleasure
.
    
<EOS>
Fanny
be
right
enough
in
not
expect
to
hear
from
Miss
Crawford
now
at
the
rapid
rate
in
which
their
correspondence
have
begin
;
Mary
's
next
letter
be
after
a
decidedly
longer
interval
than
the
last
,
but
she
be
not
right
in
supposing
that
such
an
interval
would
be
feel
a
great
relief
to
herself
.
<EOS>
here
be
another
strange
revolution
of
mind
!
<EOS>
She
be
really
glad
to
receive
the
letter
when
it
do
come
.
<EOS>
in
her
present
exile
from
good
society
,
and
distance
from
everything
that
have
be
will
not
to
interest
her
,
a
letter
from
one
belong
to
the
set
where
her
heart
live
,
write
with
affection
,
and
some
degree
of
elegance
,
be
thoroughly
acceptable
.
<EOS>
the
usual
plea
of
increase
engagement
be
make
in
excuse
for
not
have
write
to
her
earlier
;
"
and
now
that
I
have
begin
,
"
she
continue
,
"
my
letter
will
not
be
worth
your
reading
,
for
there
will
be
no
little
offering
of
love
at
the
end
,
no
three
or
four
line
_
passionnee
_
from
the
most
devoted
H.
C.
in
the
world
,
for
Henry
be
in
Norfolk
;
business
call
him
to
Everingham
ten
day
ago
,
or
perhaps
he
only
pretend
to
call
,
for
the
sake
of
be
travel
at
the
same
time
that
you
be
.
<EOS>
but
there
he
be
,
and
,
by
the
bye
,
his
absence
may
sufficiently
account
for
any
remissness
of
his
sister
's
in
writing
,
<EOS>
for
there
have
be
no
<EOS>
"
well
,
Mary
,
when
do
you
write
to
Fanny
?
<EOS>
be
not
it
time
for
you
to
write
to
Fanny
?
"
to
spur
me
on
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
after
various
attempt
at
meeting
,
I
have
see
your
cousin
,
"
<EOS>
dear
Julia
and
dear
Mrs.
Rushworth
'
;
they
find
me
at
home
yesterday
,
and
we
be
glad
to
see
each
other
again
.
<EOS>
We
_
seem
_
_
very
_
<EOS>
glad
to
see
each
other
,
and
I
do
really
think
we
be
a
little
.
<EOS>
We
have
a
vast
deal
to
say
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
tell
you
how
Mrs.
Rushworth
look
when
your
name
be
mention
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
use
to
think
her
want
in
self
-
possession
,
but
she
have
not
quite
enough
for
the
demand
of
yesterday
.
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
Julia
be
in
the
good
look
of
the
two
,
at
least
after
you
be
speak
of
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
recover
the
complexion
from
the
moment
that
I
speak
of
"
Fanny
,
"
and
speak
of
her
as
a
sister
should
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Rushworth
's
day
of
good
look
will
come
;
we
have
card
for
her
first
party
on
the
28th
.
<EOS>
then
she
will
be
in
beauty
,
for
she
will
open
one
of
the
good
house
in
Wimpole
Street
.
<EOS>
I
be
in
it
two
year
ago
,
when
it
be
Lady
Lascelle
's
,
and
prefer
it
to
almost
any
I
know
in
London
,
and
certainly
she
will
then
feel
,
to
use
a
vulgar
phrase
,
that
she
have
get
her
pennyworth
for
her
penny
.
<EOS>
Henry
could
not
have
afford
her
such
a
house
.
<EOS>
I
hope
she
will
recollect
it
,
and
be
satisfied
,
as
well
as
she
may
,
with
move
the
queen
of
a
palace
,
though
the
king
may
appear
good
in
the
background
;
and
as
I
have
no
desire
to
tease
her
,
I
shall
never
_
force
_
your
name
upon
her
again
.
<EOS>
She
will
grow
sober
by
degree
.
<EOS>
from
all
that
I
hear
and
guess
,
Baron
Wildenheim
's
attention
to
Julia
continue
,
but
I
do
not
know
that
he
have
any
serious
encouragement
.
<EOS>
She
ought
to
do
better
.
<EOS>
a
poor
honourable
be
no
catch
,
and
I
can
not
imagine
any
liking
in
the
case
,
for
take
away
his
rant
,
and
the
poor
baron
have
nothing
.
<EOS>
what
a
difference
a
vowel
make
!
<EOS>
if
his
rent
be
but
equal
to
his
rant
!
<EOS>
Your
cousin
Edmund
move
slowly
;
detain
,
perchance
,
by
parish
duty
.
<EOS>
there
may
be
some
old

Adieu
!
<EOS>
my
dear
sweet
Fanny
,
this
be
a
long
letter
from
London
:
write
me
a
pretty
one
in
reply
to
gladden
Henry
's
eye
,
when
he
come
back
,
and
send
me
an
account
of
all
the
dash
young
captain
whom
you
disdain
for
his
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
great
food
for
meditation
in
this
letter
,
and
chiefly
for
unpleasant
meditation
;
and
yet
,
with
all
the
uneasiness
it
supply
,
it
connect
her
with
the
absent
,
it
tell
her
of
people
and
thing
about
whom
she
have
never
feel
so
much
curiosity
as
now
,
and
she
would
have
be
glad
to
have
be
sure
of
such
a
letter
every
week
.
<EOS>
Her
correspondence
with
her
aunt
Bertram
be
her
only
concern
of
high
interest
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
any
society
in
Portsmouth
,
that
could
at
all
make
amend
for
deficiency
at
home
,
there
be
none
within
the
circle
of
her
father
's
and
mother
's
acquaintance
to
afford
her
the
small
satisfaction
:
she
see
nobody
in
whose
favour
she
could
wish
to
overcome
her
own
shyness
and
reserve
.
<EOS>
the
man
appear
to
her
all
coarse
,
the
woman
all
pert
,
everybody
underbre
;
and
she
give
as
little
contentment
as
she
receive
from
introduction
either
to
old
or
new
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
the
young
lady
who
approach
her
at
first
with
some
respect
,
in
consideration
of
her
come
from
a
baronet
's
family
,
be
soon
offend
by
what
they
term
"
air
"
;
for
,
as
she
neither
play
on
the
pianoforte
nor
wear
fine
pelisse
,
they
could
,
on
farth
observation
,
admit
no
right
of
superiority
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
solid
consolation
which
Fanny
receive
for
the
evil
of
home
,
the
first
which
her
judgment
could
entirely
approve
,
and
which
give
any
promise
of
durability
,
be
in
a
well
knowledge
of
Susan
,
and
a
hope
of
be
of
service
to
her
.
<EOS>
Susan
have
always
behave
pleasantly
to
herself
,
but
the
determined
character
of
her
general
manner
have
astonish
and
alarm
her
,
and
it
be
at
least
a
fortnight
before
she
begin
to
understand
a
disposition
so
totally
different
from
her
own
.
<EOS>
Susan
see
that
much
be
wrong
at
home
,
and
want
to
set
it
right
.
<EOS>
that
a
girl
of
fourteen
,
act
only
on
her
own
unassisted
reason
,
should
err
in
the
method
of
reform
,
be
not
wonderful
;
and
Fanny
soon
become
more
disposed
to
admire
the
natural
light
of
the
mind
which
could
so
early
distinguish
justly
,
than
to
censure
severely
the
fault
of
conduct
to
which
it
lead
.
<EOS>
Susan
be
only
act
on
the
same
truth
,
and
pursue
the
same
system
,
which
her
own
judgment
acknowledge
,
but
which
her
more
supine
and
yield
temper
would
have
shrink
from
assert
.
<EOS>
Susan
try
to
be
useful
,
where
_
she
_
could
only
have
go
away
and
cry
;
and
that
Susan
be
useful
she
could
perceive
;
that
thing
,
bad
as
they
be
,
would
have
be
bad
but
for
such
interposition
,
and
that
both
her
mother
and
Betsey
be
restrain
from
some
excess
of
very
offensive
indulgence
and
vulgarity
.
  
<EOS>
in
every
argument
with
her
mother
,
Susan
have
in
point
of
reason
the
advantage
,
and
never
be
there
any
maternal
tenderness
to
buy
her
off
.
<EOS>
the
blind
fondness
which
be
for
ever
produce
evil
around
her
she
have
never
know
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
gratitude
for
affection
past
or
present
to
make
her
well
bear
with
its
excess
to
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
become
gradually
evident
,
and
gradually
place
Susan
before
her
sister
as
an
object
of
mingle
compassion
and
respect
.
<EOS>
that
her
manner
be
wrong
,
however
,
at
time
very
wrong
,
her
measure
often
ill
-
choose
and
ill
-
time
,
and
her
look
and
language
very
often
indefensible
,
Fanny
could
not
cease
to
feel
;
but
she
begin
to
hope
they
may
be
rectify
.
<EOS>
Susan
,
she
find
,
look
up
to
her
and
wish
for
her
good
opinion
;
and
new
as
anything
like
an
office
of
authority
be
to
Fanny
,
new
as
it
be
to
imagine
herself
capable
of
guide
or
inform
any
one
,
she
do
resolve
to
give
occasional
hint
to
Susan
,
and
endeavour
to
exercise
for
her
advantage
the
juster
notion
of
what
be
due
to
everybody
,
and
what
would
be
wise
for
herself
,
which
her
own
more
favour
education
have
fix
in
her
.
  
<EOS>
Her
influence
,
or
at
least
the
consciousness
and
use
of
it
,
originate
in
an
act
of
kindness
by
Susan
,
which
,
after
many
hesitation
of
delicacy
,
she
at
last
work
herself
up
to
.
<EOS>
It
have
very
early
occur
to
her
that
a
small
sum
of
money
may
,
perhaps
,
restore
peace
for
ever
on
the
sore
subject
of
the
silver
knife
,
canvass
as
it
now
be
continually
,
and
the
rich
which
she
be
in
possession
of
herself
,
her
uncle
<EOS>
have
give
her
10
pound
at
parting
,
make
her
as
able
as
she
be
willing
to
be
generous
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
so
wholly
unused
to
confer
favour
,
except
on
the
very
poor
,
so
unpractised
in
remove
evil
,
or
bestow
kindness
among
her
equal
,
and
so
fearful
of
appear
to
elevate
herself
as
a
great
lady
at
home
,
that
it
take
some
time
to
determine
that
it
would
not
be
unbecoming
in
her
to
make
such
a
present
.
<EOS>
It
be
make
,
however
,
at
last
:
a
silver
knife
be
buy
for
Betsey
,
and
accept
with
great
delight
,
its
newness
give
it
every
advantage
over
the
other
that
could
be
desire
;
Susan
be
establish
in
the
full
possession
of
her
own
,
Betsey
handsomely
declare
that
now
she
have
get
one
so
much
pretty
herself
,
she
should
never
want
_
that
_
again
;
and
no
reproach
seem
convey
to
the
equally
satisfied
mother
,
which
Fanny
have
almost
fear
to
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
the
deed
thoroughly
answer
:
a
source
of
domestic
altercation
be
entirely
do
away
,
and
it
be
the
mean
of
open
Susan
's
heart
to
her
,
and
give
her
something
more
to
love
and
be
interested
in
.
<EOS>
Susan
shew
that
she
have
delicacy
:
pleased
as
she
be
to
be
mistress
of
property
which
she
have
be
struggle
for
at
least
two
year
<EOS>
,
she
yet
fear
that
her
sister
's
judgment
have
be
against
her
,
and
that
a
reproof
be
design
her
for
have
so
struggle
as
to
make
the
purchase
necessary
for
the
tranquillity
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Her
temper
be
open
.
<EOS>
She
acknowledge
her
fear
,
blame
herself
for
have
contend
so
warmly
;
and
from
that
hour
Fanny
,
understand
the
worth
of
her
disposition
and
perceive
how
fully
she
be
inclined
to
seek
her
good
opinion
and
refer
to
her
judgment
,
begin
to
feel
again
the
blessing
of
affection
,
and
to
entertain
the
hope
of
be
useful
to
a
mind
so
much
in
need
of
help
,
and
so
much
deserve
it
.
<EOS>
She
give
advice
,
advice
too
sound
to
be
resist
by
a
good
understanding
,
and
give
so
mildly
and
considerately
as
not
to
irritate
an
imperfect
temper
,
and
she
have
the
happiness
of
observe
its
good
effect
not
unfrequently
.
<EOS>
More
be
not
expect
by
one
who
,
while
see
all
the
obligation
and
expediency
of
submission
and
forbearance
,
see
also
with
sympathetic
acuteness
of
feel
all
that
must
be
hourly
grate
to
a
girl
like
Susan
.
<EOS>
Her
great
wonder
on
the
subject
soon
become
 
not
that
Susan
should
have
be
provoke
into
disrespect
and
impatience
against
her
well
knowledge
 
but
that
so
much
well
knowledge
,
so
many
good
notion
should
have
be
her
at
all
;
and
that
,
bring
up
in
the
midst
of
negligence
and
error
,
she
should
have
form
such
proper
opinion
of
what
ought
to
be
;
she
,
who
have
have
no
cousin
Edmund
to
direct
her
thought
or
fix
her
principle
.
  
<EOS>
the
intimacy
thus
begin
between
them
be
a
material
advantage
to
each
.
<EOS>
by
sit
together
upstairs
,
they
avoid
a
great
deal
of
the
disturbance
of
the
house
;
Fanny
have
peace
,
and
Susan
learn
to
think
it
no
misfortune
to
be
quietly
employ
.
<EOS>
They
sit
without
a
fire
;
but
that
be
a
privation
familiar
even
to
Fanny
,
and
she
suffer
the
less
because
remind
by
it
of
the
East
room
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
only
point
of
resemblance
.
<EOS>
in
space
,
light
,
furniture
,
and
prospect
,
there
be
nothing
alike
in
the
two
apartment
;
and
she
often
heave
a
sigh
at
the
remembrance
of
all
her
book
and
box
,
and
various
comfort
there
.
<EOS>
by
degree
the
girl
come
to
spend
the
chief
of
the
morning
upstairs
,
at
first
only
in
work
and
talk
,
but
after
a
few
day
,
the
remembrance
of
the
say
book
grow
so
potent
and
stimulative
that
Fanny
find
it
impossible
not
to
try
for
book
again
.
<EOS>
there
be
none
in
her
father
's
house
;
but
wealth
be
luxurious
and
daring
,
and
some
of
her
find
its
way
to
a
circulate
library
.
<EOS>
She
become
a
subscriber
;
amazed
at
be
anything
_
in
propria
persona
_
,
amazed
at
her
own
doing
in
every
way
,
to
be
a
renter
,
a
chuser
of
book
!
<EOS>
and
to
be
have
any
one
's
improvement
in
view
in
her
choice
!
<EOS>
but
so
it
be
.
<EOS>
Susan
have
read
nothing
,
and
Fanny
long
to
give
her
a
share
in
her
own
first
pleasure
,
and
inspire
a
taste
for
the
biography
and
poetry
which
she
delight
in
herself
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
occupation
she
hope
,
moreover
,
to
bury
some
of
the
recollection
of
Mansfield
,
which
be
too
apt
to
seize
her
mind
if
her
finger
only
be
busy
;
and
,
especially
at
this
time
,
hope
it
may
be
useful
in
divert
her
thought
from
pursue
Edmund
to
London
,
whither
,
on
the
authority
of
her
aunt
's
last
letter
<EOS>
,
she
know
he
be
go
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
doubt
of
what
would
ensue
.
<EOS>
the
promised
notification
be
hang
over
her
head
.
<EOS>
the
postman
's
knock
within
the
neighbourhood
be
begin
to
bring
its
daily
terror
,
and
if
reading
could
banish
the
idea
for
even
half
an
hour
,
it
be
something
gain
.
    
<EOS>
a
week
be
go
since
Edmund
may
be
suppose
in
town
,
and
Fanny
have
hear
nothing
of
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
three
different
conclusion
to
be
draw
from
his
silence
,
between
which
her
mind
be
in
fluctuation
;
each
of
them
at
time
be
hold
the
most
probable
.
<EOS>
either
his
going
have
be
again
delay
,
or
he
have
yet
procure
no
opportunity
of
see
Miss
Crawford
alone
,
or
he
be
too
happy
for
letter
-
writing
!
  
<EOS>
one
morning
,
about
this
time
,
Fanny
have
now
be
nearly
four
week
from
Mansfield
,
a
point
which
she
never
fail
to
think
over
and
calculate
every
day
,
as
she
and
Susan
be
prepare
to
remove
,
as
usual
,
upstairs
,
they
be
stop
by
the
knock
of
a
visitor
,
whom
they
feel
they
could
not
avoid
,
from
Rebecca
's
alertness
in
go
to
the
door
,
a
duty
which
always
interest
her
beyond
any
other
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
gentleman
's
voice
;
it
be
a
voice
that
Fanny
be
just
turn
pale
about
,
when
Mr.
Crawford
walk
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
good
sense
,
like
her
,
will
always
act
when
really
call
upon
;
and
she
find
that
she
have
be
able
to
name
him
to
her
mother
,
and
recall
her
remembrance
of
the
name
,
as
that
of
"
William
's
friend
,
"
though
she
could
not
previously
have
believe
herself
capable
of
utter
a
syllable
at
such
a
moment
.
<EOS>
the
consciousness
of
his
be
know
there
only
as
William
's
friend
be
some
support
.
<EOS>
have
introduce
him
,
however
,
and
be
all
reseat
,
the
terror
that
occur
of
what
this
visit
may
lead
to
be
overpower
,
and
she
fancy
herself
on
the
point
of
faint
away
.
  
<EOS>
while
try
to
keep
herself
alive
,
their
visitor
,
who
have
at
first
approach
her
with
as
animate
a
countenance
as
ever
,
be
wisely
and
kindly
keep
his
eye
away
,
and
give
her
time
to
recover
,
while
he
devote
himself
entirely
to
her
mother
,
address
her
,
and
attend
to
her
with
the
utmost
politeness
and
propriety
,
at
the
same
time
with
a
degree
of
friendliness
,
of
interest
at
least
,
which
be
make
his
manner
perfect
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Price
's
manner
be
also
at
their
good
.
<EOS>
warm
by
the
sight
of
such
a
friend
to
her
son
,
and
regulate
by
the
wish
of
appear
to
advantage
before
him
,
she
be
overflow
with
gratitude
 
artless
,
maternal
gratitude
 
which
could
not
be
unplease
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Price
be
out
,
which
she
regret
very
much
.
<EOS>
Fanny
be
just
recover
enough
to
feel
that
_
she
_
could
not
regret
it
;
for
to
her
many
other
source
of
uneasiness
be
add
the
severe
one
of
shame
for
the
home
in
which
he
find
her
.
<EOS>
She
may
scold
herself
for
the
weakness
,
but
there
be
no
scold
it
away
.
<EOS>
She
be
ashamed
,
and
she
would
have
be
yet
more
ashamed
of
her
father
than
of
all
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
They
talk
of
William
,
a
subject
on
which
Mrs.
Price
could
never
tire
;
and
Mr.
Crawford
be
as
warm
in
his
commendation
as
even
her
heart
could
wish
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
she
have
never
see
so
agreeable
a
man
in
her
life
;
and
be
only
astonished
to
find
that
,
so
great
and
so
agreeable
as
he
be
,
he
should
be
come
down
to
Portsmouth
neither
on
a
visit
to
the
port
-
admiral
,
nor
the
commissioner
,
nor
yet
with
the
intention
of
go
over
to
the
island
,
nor
of
see
the
dockyard
.
<EOS>
nothing
of
all
that
she
have
be
use
to
think
of
as
the
proof
of
importance
,
or
the
employment
of
wealth
,
have
bring
him
to
Portsmouth
.
<EOS>
He
have
reach
it
late
the
night
before
,
be
come
for
a
day
or
two
,
be
stay
at
the
Crown
,
have
accidentally
meet
with
a
navy
officer
or
two
of
his
acquaintance
since
his
arrival
,
but
have
no
object
of
that
kind
in
come
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
time
he
have
give
all
this
information
,
it
be
not
unreasonable
to
suppose
that
Fanny
may
be
look
at
and
speak
to
;
and
she
be
tolerably
able
to
bear
his
eye
,
and
hear
that
he
have
spend
half
an
hour
with
his
sister
the
evening
before
his
leave
London
;
that
she
have
send
her
good
and
kind
love
,
but
have
have
no
time
for
writing
;
that
he
think
himself
lucky
in
see
Mary
for
even
half
an
hour
,
have
spend
scarcely
twenty
-
four
hour
in
London
,
after
his
return
from
Norfolk
,
before
he
set
off
again
;
that
her
cousin
Edmund
be
in
town
,
have
be
in
town
,
he
understand
,
a
few
day
;
that
he
have
not
see
him
himself
,
but
that
he
be
well
,
have
leave
them
all
well
at
Mansfield
,
and
be
to
dine
,
as
yesterday
,
with
the
Frasers
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
listen
collectedly
,
even
to
the
last
-
mention
circumstance
;
nay
,
it
seem
a
relief
to
her
wear
mind
to
be
at
any
certainty
;
and
the
word
,
"
then
by
this
time
it
be
all
settle
,
"
pass
internally
,
without
more
evidence
of
emotion
than
a
faint
blush
.
  
<EOS>
after
talk
a
little
more
about
Mansfield
,
a
subject
in
which
her
interest
be
most
apparent
,
Crawford
begin
to
hint
at
the
expediency
of
an
early
walk
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
lovely
morning
,
and
at
that
season
of
the
year
a
fine
morning
so
often
turn
off
,
that
it
be
wisest
for
everybody
not
to
delay
their
exercise
"
;
and
such
hint
produce
nothing
,
he
soon
proceed
to
a
positive
recommendation
to
Mrs.
Price
and
her
daughter
to
take
their
walk
without
loss
of
time
.
<EOS>
now
they
come
to
an
understanding
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Price
,
it
appear
,
scarcely
ever
stir
out
of
door
,
except
of
a
Sunday
;
she
own
she
could
seldom
,
with
her
large
family
,
find
time
for
a
walk
.
"
<EOS>
Would
she
not
,
then
,
persuade
her
daughter
to
take
advantage
of
such
weather
,
and
allow
him
the
pleasure
of
attend
them
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Price
be
greatly
oblige
and
very
complying
.
"
<EOS>
Her
daughter
be
very
much
confine
;
Portsmouth
be
a
sad
place
;
they
do
not
often
get
out
;
and
she
know
they
have
some
errand
in
the
town
,
which
they
would
be
very
glad
to
do
.
"
<EOS>
and
the
consequence
be
,
that
Fanny
,
strange
as
it
be
 
strange
,
awkward
,
and
distress
 
find
herself
and
Susan
,
within
ten
minute
,
walk
towards
the
High
Street
with
Mr.
Crawford
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
soon
pain
upon
pain
,
confusion
upon
confusion
;
for
they
be
hardly
in
the
High
Street
before
they
meet
her
father
,
whose
appearance
be
not
the
well
from
its
be
Saturday
.
<EOS>
He
stopt
;
and
,
ungentlemanlike
as
he
look
,
Fanny
be
oblige
to
introduce
him
to
Mr.
Crawford
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
have
a
doubt
of
the
manner
in
which
Mr.
Crawford
must
be
strike
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
ashamed
and
disgusted
altogether
.
<EOS>
He
must
soon
give
her
up
,
and
cease
to
have
the
small
inclination
for
the
match
;
and
yet
,
though
she
have
be
so
much
want
his
affection
to
be
cure
,
this
be
a
sort
of
cure
that
would
be
almost
as
bad
as
the
complaint
;
and
I
believe
there
be
scarcely
a
young
lady
in
the
United
Kingdoms
who
would
not
rather
put
up
with
the
misfortune
of
be
seek
by
a
clever
,
agreeable
man
,
than
have
him
drive
away
by
the
vulgarity
of
her
near
relation
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Crawford
probably
could
not
regard
his
future
father
-
in
-
law
with
any
idea
of
take
him
for
a
model
in
dress
;
but
(
as
Fanny
instantly
,
and
to
her
great
relief
,
discern
)
<EOS>
her
father
be
a
very
different
man
,
a
very
different
Mr.
Price
in
his
behaviour
to
this
most
highly
respected
stranger
,
from
what
he
be
in
his
own
family
at
home
.
<EOS>
His
manner
now
,
though
not
polish
,
be
more
than
passable
:
they
be
grateful
,
animate
,
manly
;
his
expression
be
those
of
an
attach
father
,
and
a
sensible
man
;
his
loud
tone
do
very
well
in
the
open
air
,
and
there
be
not
a
single
oath
to
be
hear
.
<EOS>
such
be
his
instinctive
compliment
to
the
good
manner
of
Mr.
Crawford
;
and
,
be
the
consequence
<EOS>
what
it
may
,
Fanny
's
immediate
feeling
be
infinitely
soothe
.
  
<EOS>
the
conclusion
of
the
two
gentleman
's
civility
be
an
offer
of
Mr.
Price
's
to
take
Mr.
Crawford
into
the
dockyard
,
which
Mr.
Crawford
,
desirous
of
accept
as
a
favour
what
be
intend
as
such
,
though
he
have
see
the
dockyard
again
and
again
,
and
hope
to
be
so
much
the
longer
with
Fanny
,
be
very
gratefully
dispose
to
avail
himself
of
,
if
the
Miss
Prices
be
not
afraid
of
the
fatigue
;
and
as
it
be
somehow
or
other
ascertained
,
or
infer
,
or
at
least
act
upon
,
that
they
be
not
at
all
afraid
,
to
the
dockyard
they
be
all
to
go
;
and
but
for
Mr.
Crawford
,
Mr.
Price
would
have
turn
thither
directly
,
without
the
small
consideration
for
his
daughter
'
errand
in
the
High
Street
.
<EOS>
He
take
care
,
however
,
that
they
should
be
allow
to
go
to
the
shop
they
come
out
expressly
to
visit
;
and
it
do
not
delay
them
long
,
for
Fanny
could
so
little
bear
to
excite
impatience
,
or
be
wait
for
,
that
before
the
gentleman
,
as
they
stand
at
the
door
,
could
do
<EOS>
more
than
begin
upon
the
last
naval
regulation
,
or
settle
the
number
of
three
-
decker
now
in
commission
,
their
companion
be
ready
to
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
then
to
set
forward
for
the
dockyard
at
once
,
and
the
walk
would
have
be
conduct
 
accord
to
Mr.
Crawford
's
opinion
 
in
a
singular
manner
,
have
Mr.
Price
be
allow
the
entire
regulation
of
it
,
as
the
two
girl
,
he
find
,
would
have
be
leave
to
follow
,
and
keep
up
with
them
or
not
,
as
they
could
,
while
they
walk
on
together
at
their
own
hasty
pace
.
<EOS>
He
be
able
to
introduce
some
improvement
occasionally
,
though
by
no
means
to
the
extent
he
wish
;
he
absolutely
would
not
walk
away
from
them
;
and
at
any
crossing
or
any
crowd
,
when
Mr.
Price
be
only
call
out
,
"
come
,
girl
;
come
,
Fan
;
come
,
Sue
,
take
care
of
yourself
;
keep
a
sharp
lookout
!
"
<EOS>
he
would
give
them
his
particular
attendance
.
  
<EOS>
once
fairly
in
the
dockyard
,
he
begin
to
reckon
upon
some
happy
intercourse
with
Fanny
,
as
they
be
very
soon
join
by
a
brother
lounger
of
Mr.
Price
's
,
who
be
come
to
take
his
daily
survey
of
how
thing
go
on
,
and
who
must
prove
a
far
more
worthy
companion
than
himself
;
and
after
a
time
the
two
officer
seem
very
well
satisfied
go
about
together
,
and
discuss
matter
of
equal
and
never
-
fail
interest
,
while
the
young
people
sit
down
upon
some
timber
in
the
yard
,
or
find
a
seat
on
board
a
vessel
in
the
stock
which
they
all
go
to
look
at
.
<EOS>
Fanny
be
most
conveniently
in
want
of
rest
.
<EOS>
Crawford
could
not
have
wish
her
more
fatigued
or
more
ready
to
sit
down
;
but
he
could
have
wish
her
sister
away
.
<EOS>
a
quick
-
looking
girl
of
Susan
's
age
be
the
very
bad
third
in
the
world
:
totally
different
from
Lady
Bertram
,
all
eye
and
ear
;
and
there
be
no
introduce
the
main
point
before
her
.
<EOS>
He
must
content
himself
with
be
only
generally
agreeable
,
and
let
Susan
have
her
share
of
entertainment
,
with
the
indulgence
,
now
and
<EOS>
then
,
of
a
look
or
hint
for
the
better
-
inform
and
conscious
Fanny
.
<EOS>
Norfolk
be
what
he
have
mostly
to
talk
of
:
there
he
have
be
some
time
,
and
everything
there
be
rise
in
importance
from
his
present
scheme
.
<EOS>
such
a
man
could
come
from
no
place
,
no
society
,
without
import
something
to
amuse
;
his
journey
and
his
acquaintance
be
all
of
use
,
and
Susan
be
entertain
in
a
way
quite
new
to
her
.
<EOS>
for
Fanny
,
somewhat
more
be
relate
than
the
accidental
agreeableness
of
the
party
he
have
be
in
.
<EOS>
for
her
approbation
,
the
particular
reason
of
his
go
into
Norfolk
at
all
,
at
this
unusual
time
of
year
,
be
give
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
real
business
,
relative
to
the
renewal
of
a
lease
in
which
the
welfare
of
a
large
and
 
he
believe
 
industrious
family
be
at
stake
.
<EOS>
He
have
suspect
his
agent
of
some
underhand
dealing
;
of
meaning
to
bias
him
against
the
deserving
;
and
he
have
determine
to
go
himself
,
and
thoroughly
investigate
the
merit
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
He
have
go
,
have
do
even
more
good
than
he
have
foresee
,
have
be
useful
to
more
than
his
first
plan
have
comprehend
,
and
be
now
able
to
congratulate
himself
upon
it
,
and
to
feel
that
in
perform
a
duty
,
he
have
secure
agreeable
recollection
for
his
own
mind
.
<EOS>
He
have
introduce
himself
to
some
tenant
whom
he
have
never
see
before
;
he
have
begin
make
acquaintance
with
cottage
whose
very
existence
,
though
on
his
own
estate
,
have
be
hitherto
unknown
to
him
.
<EOS>
this
be
aim
,
and
well
aim
,
at
Fanny
.
<EOS>
It
be
pleasing
to
hear
him
speak
so
properly
;
here
he
have
be
act
as
he
ought
to
do
.
<EOS>
to
be
the
friend
of
the
poor
and
the
oppressed
!
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
grateful
to
her
;
and
she
be
on
the
point
of
give
him
an
approve
look
,
when
it
be
all
frightened
off
by
his
add
a
something
too
pointed
of
his
hope
soon
to
have
an
assistant
,
a
friend
,
a
guide
in
every
plan
of
utility
or
charity
for
Everingham
:
a
somebody
that
would
make
Everingham
and
all
about
it
<EOS>
a
dearer
object
than
it
have
ever
be
yet
.
  
<EOS>
She
turn
away
,
and
wish
he
would
not
say
such
thing
.
<EOS>
She
be
willing
to
allow
he
may
have
more
good
quality
than
she
have
be
will
not
to
suppose
.
<EOS>
She
begin
to
feel
the
possibility
of
his
turn
out
well
at
last
;
but
he
be
and
must
ever
be
completely
unsuited
to
her
,
and
ought
not
to
think
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
perceive
that
enough
have
be
say
of
Everingham
,
and
that
it
would
be
as
well
to
talk
of
something
else
,
and
turn
to
Mansfield
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
choose
better
;
that
be
a
topic
to
bring
back
her
attention
and
<EOS>
her
look
almost
instantly
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
real
indulgence
to
her
to
hear
or
to
speak
of
Mansfield
.
<EOS>
now
so
long
divide
from
everybody
who
know
the
place
,
she
feel
it
quite
the
voice
of
a
friend
when
he
mention
it
,
and
lead
the
way
to
her
fond
exclamation
in
praise
of
its
beauty
and
comfort
,
and
by
his
honourable
tribute
to
its
inhabitant
allow
her
to
gratify
her
own
heart
in
the
warm
eulogium
,
in
speak
of
her
uncle
as
all
that
be
clever
and
good
,
and
her
aunt
as
have
the
sweetest
of
all
sweet
temper
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
a
great
attachment
to
Mansfield
himself
;
he
say
so
<EOS>
;
he
look
forward
with
the
hope
of
spend
much
,
very
much
,
of
his
time
there
;
always
there
,
or
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
He
particularly
build
upon
a
very
happy
summer
and
autumn
there
this
year
;
he
feel
that
it
would
be
so
:
he
depend
upon
it
;
a
summer
and
autumn
infinitely
superior
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
as
animate
,
as
diversify
,
as
social
,
but
with
circumstance
of
superiority
undescribable
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mansfield
,
Sotherton
,
Thornton
Lacey
,
"
he
continue
;
"
what
a
society
will
be
comprise
in
those
house
!
<EOS>
and
at
Michaelmas
,
perhaps
,
a
fourth
may
be
add
:
some
small
hunting
-
box
in
the
vicinity
of
everything
so
dear
<EOS>
;
for
as
to
any
partnership
in
Thornton
Lacey
,
as
Edmund
Bertram
once
good
-
humouredly
propose
,
I
hope
I
foresee
two
objection
:
two
fair
,
excellent
,
irresistible
objection
to
that
plan
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
be
doubly
silence
here
;
though
when
the
moment
be
pass
,
could
regret
that
she
have
not
force
herself
into
the
acknowledge
comprehension
of
one
half
of
his
meaning
,
and
encourage
him
to
say
something
more
of
his
sister
and
Edmund
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
subject
which
she
must
learn
to
speak
of
,
and
the
weakness
that
shrink
from
it
would
soon
be
quite
unpardonable
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Price
and
his
friend
have
see
all
that
they
wish
,
or
have
time
for
,
the
other
be
ready
to
return
;
and
in
the
course
of
their
walk
back
,
Mr.
Crawford
contrive
a
minute
's
privacy
for
tell
Fanny
that
his
only
business
in
Portsmouth
be
to
see
her
;
that
he
be
come
down
for
a
couple
of
day
on
her
account
,
and
her
only
,
and
because
he
could
not
endure
a
long
total
separation
.
<EOS>
She
be
sorry
,
really
sorry
;
and
yet
in
spite
of
this
and
the
two
or
three
other
thing
which
she
wish
he
have
not
say
,
she
think
him
altogether
improve
since
she
have
see
him
;
he
be
much
more
gentle
,
obliging
,
and
attentive
to
other
people
's
feeling
than
he
have
ever
be
at
Mansfield
;
she
have
never
see
him
so
agreeable
 
<EOS>
so
_
near
_
be
agreeable
;
his
behaviour
to
her
father
could
not
offend
,
and
there
be
something
particularly
kind
and
proper
in
the
notice
he
take
of
Susan
.
<EOS>
He
be
decidedly
improve
.
<EOS>
She
wish
the
next
day
over
,
she
wish
he
have
come
only
for
one
day
;
but
it
be
not
so
very
bad
as
she
would
have
expect
:
the
pleasure
of
talking
of
Mansfield
be
so
very
great
!
  
<EOS>
before
they
part
,
she
have
to
thank
him
for
another
pleasure
,
and
one
of
no
trivial
kind
.
<EOS>
Her
father
ask
him
to
do
them
the
honour
of
take
his
mutton
with
them
,
and
Fanny
have
time
for
only
one
thrill
of
horror
,
before
he
declare
himself
prevent
by
a
prior
engagement
.
<EOS>
He
be
engage
to
dinner
already
both
for
that
day
and
the
next
;
he
have
meet
with
some
acquaintance
at
the
Crown
who
would
not
be
deny
;
he
should
have
the
honour
,
however
,
of
wait
on
them
again
on

<EOS>
to

would
have
be
dreadful
!
<EOS>
Rebecca

and
Rebecca

and
Betsey

without

and
pull
everything
about
as
she
choose
<EOS>
,
be
what
Fanny
herself
be
not
yet
enough
inure
to
for
her
often
to
make
a
tolerable
meal
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She

nice
only
from
natural
delicacy

but

he

have
be
bring
up
in
a
school
of
luxury
and
epicurism
.
    
<EOS>
the
price
be
just
set
off
for
church
the
next
day
when
Mr.
Crawford
appear
again
.
<EOS>
He
come
,
not
to
stop
,
but
to
join
them
;
he
be
ask
to
go
with
them
to
the
Garrison
chapel
,
which
be
exactly
what
he
have
intend
,
and
they
all
walk
thither
together

<EOS>
the
family

to
advantage
.
<EOS>
nature
have
give
them
no
inconsiderable
share
of
beauty
,
and
every
Sunday
dress
them
in
their
clean
skin
and
good
attire
.
<EOS>
Sunday
always
bring
this
comfort
to
Fanny
,
and
on
this
Sunday
she
feel
it
more
than
ever
.
<EOS>
Her
poor
mother
now
do
not
look
so
very
unworthy
of
be
Lady
Bertram
's
sister
as
she
be
but
too
apt
to
look
.
<EOS>
It
often
grieve
her
to
the
heart
to
think
of
the
contrast
between
them
;
to
think
that
where
nature
have
make
so
little
difference
,
circumstance
should
have
make
so
much
,
and
that
her
mother
,
as
handsome
as
Lady
Bertram
,
and
some
year
her
junior
,
should
have
an
appearance
so
much
more
worn
and
fade
,
so
comfortless
,
so
slatternly
,
so
shabby
.
<EOS>
but
Sunday
make
her
a
very
creditable
and
tolerably
cheerful
-
look
Mrs.
Price
,
come
abroad
with
a
fine
family
of
child
,
feel
a
little
respite
of
her
weekly
care
,
and
only
discompose
if
she
see
her
boy
run
into
danger
,
or
Rebecca
pass
by
with
a
flower
in
her
hat
.
  
<EOS>
in
chapel
they
be
oblige
to
divide
,
but
Mr.
Crawford
take
care
not
to
be
divide
from
the
female
branch
;
and
after
chapel
he
still
continue
with
them
,
and
make
one
in
the
family
party
on
the
rampart
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Price
take
her
weekly
walk
on
the
rampart
every
fine
Sunday
throughout
the
year
,
always
go
directly
after
morning
service
and
stay
till
dinner
-
time
.
<EOS>
It
be
her
public
place
:
there
she
meet
her
acquaintance
,
hear
a
little
news
,
talk
over
the
badness
of
the
Portsmouth
servant
,
and
wound
up
her
spirit
for
the
six
day
ensue
.
  
<EOS>
thither
they
now
go
;
Mr.
Crawford
most
happy
to
consider
the
Miss
Prices
as
his
peculiar
charge
;
and
before
they
have
be
there
long
,
somehow
or
other
,
there
be
no
say
how
,
Fanny
could
not
have
believe
it
,
but
he
be
walk
between
them
with
an
arm
of
each
under
his
,
and
she
do
not
know
how
to
prevent
or
put
an
end
to
it
.
<EOS>
It
make
her
uncomfortable
for
a
time
,
but
yet
there
be
enjoyment
in
the
day
and
in
the
view
which
would
be
feel
.
  
<EOS>
the
day
be
uncommonly
lovely
.
<EOS>
It
be
really
March
;
but
it
be
April
in
its
mild
air
,
brisk
soft
wind
,
and
bright
sun
,
occasionally
cloud
for
a
minute
;
and
everything
look
so
beautiful
under
the
influence
of
such
a
sky
,
the
effect
of
the
shadow
pursue
each
other
on
the
ship
at
Spithead
and
the
island
beyond
,
with
the
ever
-
vary
hue
of
the
sea
,
now
at
high
water
,
dance
in
its
glee
and
dash
against
the
rampart
with
so
fine
a
sound
,
produce
altogether
such
a
combination
of
charm
for
Fanny
,
as
make
her
gradually
almost
careless
of
the
circumstance
under
which
she
feel
them
.
<EOS>
nay
,
have
she
be
without
his
arm
,
she
would
soon
have
know
that
she
need
it
,
for
she
want
strength
for
a
two
hour
'
saunter
of
this
kind
,
come
,
as
it
generally
do
,
upon
a
week
's
previous
inactivity
.
<EOS>
Fanny
be
begin
to
feel
the
effect
of
be
debar
from
her
usual
regular
exercise
;
she
have
lose
ground
as
to
health
since
her
be
in
Portsmouth
;
and
but
for
Mr.
Crawford
and
the
beauty
of
the
weather
would
soon
have
be
knock
up
now
.
  
<EOS>
the
loveliness
of
the
day
,
and
of
the
view
<EOS>
,
he
feel
like
herself
.
<EOS>
They
often
stopt
with
the
same
sentiment
and
taste
,
lean
against
the
wall
,
some
minute
,
to
look
and
admire
;
and
consider
he
be
not
Edmund
,
Fanny
<EOS>
could
not
but
allow
that
he
be
sufficiently
open
to
the
charm
of
nature
,
and
very
well
able
to
express
his
admiration
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
few
tender
reverie
now
and
then
,
which
he
could
sometimes
take
advantage
of
to
look
in
her
face
without
detection
;
and
the
result
of
these
look
be
,
that
though
as
bewitch
as
ever
,
her
face
be
less
bloom
than
it
ought
to
be
.
<EOS>
She
_
say
_
<EOS>
she
be
very
well
,
and
do
not
like
to
be
suppose
otherwise
;
but
take
it
all
in
all
,
he
be
convince
that
her
present
residence
could
not
be
comfortable
,
and
therefore
could
not
be
salutary
for
her
,
and
he
be
grow
anxious
for
her
be
again
at
Mansfield
,
where
her
own
happiness
,
and
his
in
see
her
,
must
be
so
much
great
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
be
here
a

he

<EOS>
"
no

<EOS>
after
a
moment
's
reflection
,
Mr.

reply
,
"
I

<EOS>
Fanny
thank
him
again
,
but
be
affect
and
distress
to
a
degree
that
make
it
impossible
for
her
to
say
much

even
to
be
certain
of
what
she
ought
to

this
be
towards
the
close

He
attend

only
at

still

I

I
leave
you
in
strong
health

be
there
anything
I
can
do
for
you
in
town
?
<EOS>
I
have
half
an
idea
of
go
into
Norfolk
again
soon
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
satisfied
about
Maddison
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
he
still
mean
to
impose
on
me
if
possible
,
and
get
a
cousin
of
his
own
into
a
certain
mill
,
which
I
design
for
somebody
else
.
<EOS>
I
must
come
to
an
understanding
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
must
make
him
know
that
I
will
not
be
trick
on
the
south
side
of
Everingham
,
any
more
than
on
the
north
:
that
I
will
be
master
of
my
own
property
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
explicit
enough
with
him
before
.
<EOS>
the
mischief
such
a
man
do
on
an
estate
,
both
as
to
the
credit
of
his
employer
and
the
welfare
of
the
poor
,
be
inconceivable
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
mind
to
go
back
into
Norfolk
directly
,
and
put
everything
at
once
on
such
a
footing
as
can
not
be
afterwards
swerve
from
.
<EOS>
Maddison
be
a
clever
fellow
;
I
do
not
wish
to
displace
him
,
provide
he
do
not
try
to
displace
_
me
_
;
but
it
would
be
simple
to
be
dupe
by
a
man
who
have
no
right
of
creditor
to
dupe
me
,
and
bad
than
simple
to
let
him
give
me
a
hard

hearted
,
gripe
fellow
for
a
tenant
,
instead
of
an
honest
man

to
whom
I
have
give
half
a
promise
already

<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
bad
than
simple
?

Shall
I

do
you

more
simple
one
immediately

Their
general
fare
bear
a

have
suspect
how
many
privation
,
besides
that
of
exercise

she
endure
in
her
father
's
house

he
would
have
wonder
that
her
look
be
not
much
more
affected
than
he
find
them
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
little
equal
to
Rebecca
's
pudding
and
Rebecca
's
hash
,
bring
to
table
,
as
they
all
be
,
with
such
accompaniment
of
half
-
clean
plate
,
and
not
half
-
clean
knife
and
fork
,
that
she
be
very
often
constrain
to
defer
her
heartiest
meal
till
she
could
send
her
brother
in
the
evening
for
biscuit
and
bun
.
<EOS>
after
be
nurse
up
at
Mansfield
,
it
be
too
late
in
the
day
to
be
harden
at
Portsmouth
;
and
though
Sir
Thomas
,
have
he
know
all
,
may
have
think
his
niece
in
the
most
promising
way
of
be
starve
,
both
mind
and
body
,
into
a
much
juster
value
for
Mr.
Crawford
's
good
company
and
good
fortune
,
he
would
probably
have
fear
to
push
his
experiment
farther
,
lest
she
may
die
under
the
cure
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
be
out
of
spirit
all
the
rest
of
the
day

<EOS>
though
tolerably
secure
of
not

Mr.

again

she
could
not

be
low

<EOS>
It
be
part
with
somebody
of
the
nature

though
,
in
one
light

glad
to
have
him
go

it
seem
as

now
desert
by
everybody
;
it
be
a
sort
of
renew
separation
from
Mansfield
;
and
she
could
not
think
of
his
return
to
town
,
and
be
frequently
with
Mary
and
Edmund
,
without
feeling
so
near
akin
to
envy
as
make
her
hate
herself
for
have
them
.
  
<EOS>
Her
dejection
have
no
abatement
from
anything
pass
around
her
;
a
friend
or
two
of
her
father
's
,
as
always
happen
if
he
be
not
with
them
,
spend
the
long
,
long
evening
there
;
and
from
six
o'clock
till
half
-
past
nine
,
there
be
little
intermission
of
noise
or
grog
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
low
.
<EOS>
the
wonderful
improvement
which
she
still
fancy
in
Mr.
Crawford
be
the
near
to
administer
comfort
of
anything
within
the
current
of
her
thought
.
<EOS>
not
consider
in
how
different
a
circle
she
have
be
just
see
him
,
nor
how
much
may
be
owe
to
contrast
,
she
be
quite
persuade
of
his
be
astonishingly
more
gentle
and
regardful
of
other
than
formerly
.
<EOS>
and
,
if
in
little
thing
,
must
it
not
be
so
in
great
?
<EOS>
so
anxious
for
her
health
and
comfort
,
<EOS>
so
very
feeling
as
he
now
express
himself
,
and
really
seem
,
may
not
it
be
fairly
suppose
that
he
would
not
much
long
persevere
in
a
suit
so
distress
to
her
?
    
<EOS>
It
be
presume
that
Mr.
Crawford
be
travel
back
,
to
London
,
on
the
morrow
,
for
nothing
more
be
see
of
him
at
Mr.
Price
's
;
and
two
day
afterwards
,
it
be
a
fact
ascertain
to
Fanny
by
the
following
letter
from
his
sister
,
open
and
read
by
her
,
on
another
account
,
with
the
most
anxious
curiosity
:
    
<EOS>
"
I
have
to
inform
you
,
my
dear
Fanny
,
that
Henry
have
be
down
to
Portsmouth
to
see
you
;
that
he
have
a
delightful
walk
with
you
to
the
dockyard
last
Saturday
,
and
one
still
more
to
be
dwell
on
the
next
day
,
on
the
rampart
;
when
the
balmy
air
,
the
sparkling
sea
,
and
your
sweet
look
and
conversation
be
altogether
in
the
most
delicious
harmony
,
and
afford
sensation
which
be
to
raise
ecstasy
even
in
retrospect
.
<EOS>
this
,
as
well
as
I
understand
,
be
to
be
the
substance
of
my
information
.
<EOS>
He
make
me
write
,
but
I
do
not
know
what
else
be
to
be
communicate
,
except
this
say
visit
to
Portsmouth
,
and
these
two
say
walk
,
and
his
introduction
to
your
family
,
especially
to
a
fair
sister
of
yours
,
a
fine
girl
of
fifteen
,
who
be
of
the
party
on
the
rampart
,
take
her
first
lesson
,
I
presume
,
in
love
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
time
for
write
much
,
but
it
would
be
out
of
place
if
I
have
,
for
this
be
to
be
a
mere
letter
of
business
,
pen
for
the
purpose
of
convey
necessary
information
,
which
could
not
be
delay
without
risk
of
evil
.
<EOS>
My
dear
,
dear
Fanny
,
if
I
have
you
here
,
how
I
would
talk
to
you
!
<EOS>
You
should
listen
to
me
till
you
be
tired
,
and
advise
me
till
you
be
still
tired
more
;
but
it
be
impossible
to
put
a
hundredth
part
of
my
great
mind
on
paper
,
so
I
will
abstain
altogether
,
and
leave
you
to
guess
what
you
like
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
news
for
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
politic
,
of
course
;
and
it
would
be
too
bad
to
plague
you
with
the
name
of
people
and
party
that
fill
up
my
time
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
send
you
an
account
of
your
cousin
's
first
party
,
but
I
be
lazy
,
and
now
it
be
too
long
ago
;
suffice
it
,
that
everything
be
just
as
it
ought
to
be
,
in
a
style
that
any
of
her
connexion
must
have
be
gratify
to
witness
,
and
that
her
own
dress
and
manner
do
her
the
great
credit
.
<EOS>
My
friend
,
Mrs.
Fraser
,
be
mad
for
such
a
house
,
and
it
would
not
make
_
me
_
miserable
.
<EOS>
I
go
to
Lady
Stornaway
after
Easter
;
she
seem
in
high
spirit
,
and
very
happy
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
Lord
S.
be
very
good
-
humoured
and
pleasant
in
his
own
family
,
and
I
do
not
think
him
so
very
ill
-
look
as
I
do
 
at
least
,
one
see
many
bad
.
<EOS>
He
will
not
do
by
the
side
of
your
cousin
Edmund
.
<EOS>
of
the
last
-
mention
hero
,
what
shall
I
say
?
<EOS>
if
I
avoid
his
name
entirely
,
it
would
look
suspicious
.
<EOS>
I
will
say
,
then
,
that
we
have
see
him
two
or
three
time
,
and
that
my
friend
here
be
very
much
strike
with
his
gentlemanlike
appearance
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fraser
(
no
bad
judge
)
declare
she
know
but
three
man
in
town
who
have
so
good
<EOS>
a
person
,
height
,
and
air
;
<EOS>
and
I
must
confess
,
when
he
dine
here
the
other
day
,
there
be
none
to
compare
with
him
,
and
we
be
a
party
of
sixteen
.
<EOS>
luckily
there
be
no
distinction
of
dress
nowadays
to
tell
tale
,
but
 
<EOS>
but
 
<EOS>
but
yours
affectionately
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
almost
forget
(
it
be
Edmund
's
fault
:
<EOS>
he
get
into
my
head
more
than
do
me
good
)
<EOS>
one
very
material
thing
I
have
to
say
from
Henry
and
myself
 
<EOS>
I
mean
about
our
take
you
back
into
Northamptonshire
.
<EOS>
My
dear
little
creature
,
do
not
stay
at
Portsmouth
to
lose
your
pretty
look
.
<EOS>
those
vile
sea
-
breeze
be
the
ruin
of
beauty
and
health
.
<EOS>
My
poor
aunt
always
feel
affected
if
within
ten
mile
of
the
sea
,
which
the
Admiral
of
course
never
believe
,
but
I
know
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
I
be
at
your
service
and
Henry
's
,
at
an
hour
's
notice
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
the
scheme
,
and
we
would
make
a
little
circuit
,
and
shew
you
Everingham
in
our
way
,
and
perhaps
you
would
not
mind
pass
through
London
,
and
see
the
inside
of
St.
George
's
,
Hanover
Square
.
<EOS>
only
keep
your
cousin
Edmund
from
me
at
such
a
time
:
I
should
not
like
to
be
tempt
.
<EOS>
what
a
long
letter
!
<EOS>
one
word
more
.
<EOS>
Henry
,
I
find
,
have
some
idea
of
go
into
Norfolk
again
upon
some
business
that
_
<EOS>
you
_
approve
;
but
this
can
not
possibly
be
permit
before
the
middle
of
next
week
;
that
is
,
he
can
not
anyhow
be
spare
till
after
the
14th
,
for
_
we
_
have
a
party
that
evening
.
<EOS>
the
value
of
a
man
like
Henry
,
on
such
an
occasion
,
be
what
you
can
have
no
conception
of
;
so
you
must
take
it
upon
my
word
to
be
inestimable
.
<EOS>
He
will
see
the
rushworth
,
which
own
I
be
not
sorry
for
 
have
a
little
curiosity
,
and
so
I
think
have
he
 
though
he
will
not
acknowledge
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
letter
to
be
run
through
eagerly
,
to
be
read
deliberately
,
to
supply
matter
for
much
reflection
,
and
to
leave
everything
in
great
suspense
than
ever
.
<EOS>
the
only
certainty
to
be
draw
from
it
be
,
that
nothing
decisive
have
yet
take
place
.
<EOS>
Edmund
have
not
yet
speak
.
<EOS>
how
Miss
Crawford
really
feel
,
how
she
mean
to
act
,
or
may
act
without
or
against
her
meaning
;
whether
his
importance
to
her
be
quite
what
it
have
be
before
the
last
separation
;
whether
,
if
lessen
,
it
be
likely
to
lessen
more
,
or
to
recover
itself
,
be
subject
for
endless
conjecture
,
and
to
be
think
of
on
that
day
and
many
day
to
come
,
without
produce
any
conclusion
.
<EOS>
the
idea
that
return
the
oftenest
be
that
Miss
Crawford
,
after
prove
herself
cool
and
stagger
by
a
return
to
London
habit
,
would
yet
prove
herself
in
the
end
too
much
attach
to
him
to
give
him
up
.
<EOS>
She
would
try
to
be
more
ambitious
than
her
heart
would
allow
.
<EOS>
She
would
hesitate
,
she
would
tease
,
she
would
condition
,
she
would
require
a
great
deal
,
but
she
would
finally
accept
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
Fanny
's
most
frequent
expectation
.
<EOS>
a
house
in
town
 
that
,
she
think
,
must
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
yet
there
be
no
say
what
Miss
Crawford
may
not
ask
.
<EOS>
the
prospect
for
her
cousin
grow
bad
and
bad
.
<EOS>
the
woman
who
could
speak
of
him
,
and
speak
only
of
his
appearance
!
<EOS>
what
an
unworthy
attachment
!
<EOS>
to
be
derive
support
from
the
commendation
of
Mrs.
Fraser
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
who
have
know
him
intimately
half
a
year
!
<EOS>
Fanny
be
ashamed
of
her
.
<EOS>
those
part
of
the
letter
which
relate
only
to
Mr.
Crawford
and
herself
,
touch
her
,
in
comparison
,
slightly
.
<EOS>
whether
Mr.
Crawford
go
into
Norfolk
before
or
after
the
14th
be
certainly
no
concern
of
her
,
though
,
everything
consider
,
she
think
he
_
would
_
go
without
delay
.
<EOS>
that
Miss
Crawford
should
endeavour
to
secure
a
meeting
between
him
and
Mrs.
Rushworth
,
be
all
in
her
bad
line
of
conduct
,
and
grossly
unkind
and
ill
-
judge
;
but
she
hope
_
he
_
would
not
be
actuate
by
any
such
degrade
curiosity
.
<EOS>
He
acknowledge
no
such
inducement
,
and
his
sister
ought
to
have
give
him
credit
for
well
feeling
than
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
yet
more
impatient
for
another
letter
from
town
after
receive
this
than
she
have
be
before
;
and
for
a
few
day
be
so
unsettle
by
it
altogether
,
by
what
have
come
,
and
what
may
come
,
that
her
usual
reading
and
conversation
with
Susan
be
much
suspend
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
command
her
attention
as
she
wish
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Crawford
remember
her
message
to
her
cousin
,
she
think
it
very
likely
,
most
likely
,
that
he
would
write
to
her
at
all
event
;
it
would
be
most
consistent
with
his
usual
kindness
;
and
till
she
get
rid
of
this
idea
,
till
it
gradually
wear
off
,
by
no
letter
appear
in
the
course
of
three
or
four
day
more
,
she
be
in
a
most
restless
,
anxious
state
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
,
a
something
like
composure
succeed
.
<EOS>
suspense
must
be
submit
to
,
and
must
not
be
allow
to
wear
her
out
,
and
make
her
useless
.
<EOS>
Time
do
something
,
her
own
exertion
something
more
,
and
she
resume
her
attention
to
Susan
,
and
again
awaken
the
same
interest
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
Susan
be
grow
very
fond
of
her
,
and
though
without
any
of
the
early
delight
in
book
which
have
be
so
strong
in
Fanny
,
with
a
disposition
much
less
inclined
to
sedentary
pursuit
,
or
to
information
for
information
's
sake
,
she
have
so
strong
a
desire
of
not
_
appear
_
ignorant
,
as
,
with
a
good
clear
understanding
,
make
her
a
most
attentive
,
profitable
,
thankful
pupil
.
<EOS>
Fanny
be
her
oracle
.
<EOS>
Fanny
's
explanation
and
remark
be
a
most
important
addition
to
every
essay
,
or
every
chapter
of
history
.
<EOS>
what
Fanny
tell
her
of
former
time
dwelt
more
on
her
mind
than
the
page
of
Goldsmith
;
and
she
pay
her
sister
the
compliment
of
prefer
her
style
to
that
of
any
print
author
.
<EOS>
the
early
habit
of
reading
be
want
.
  
<EOS>
Their
conversation
,
however
,
be
not
always
on
subject
so
high
as
history
or
moral
.
<EOS>
other
have
their
hour
;
and
of
less
matter
,
none
return
so
often
,
or
remain
so
long
between
them
,
as
Mansfield
Park
,
a
description
of
the
people
,
the
manner
,
the
amusement
,
the
way
of
Mansfield
Park
.
<EOS>
Susan
,
who
have
an
innate
taste
for
the
genteel
and
well
-
appoint
,
be
eager
to
hear
,
and
Fanny
could
not
but
indulge
herself
in
dwell
on
so
beloved
a
theme
.
<EOS>
She
hope
it
be
not
wrong
;
though
,
after
a
time
,
Susan
's
very
great
admiration
of
everything
say
or
do
in
her
uncle
's
house
,
and
earnest
longing
to
go
into
Northamptonshire
,
seem
almost
to
blame
her
for
exciting
feeling
which
could
not
be
gratify
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Susan
be
very
little
better
fit
for
home
than
her
eld
sister
;
and
as
Fanny
grow
thoroughly
to
understand
this
,
she
begin
to
feel
that
when
her
own
release
from
Portsmouth
come
,
her
happiness
would
have
a
material
drawback
in
leave
Susan
behind
.
<EOS>
that
a
girl
so
capable
of
be
make
everything
good
should
be
leave
in
such
hand
,
distress
her
more
and
more
.
<EOS>
be
_
<EOS>
she
_
<EOS>
likely
to
have
a
home
to
invite
her
to
,
what
a
blessing
it
would
be
!
<EOS>
and
have
it
be
possible
for
her
to
return
Mr.
Crawford
's
regard
<EOS>
,
the
probability
of
his
be
very
far
from
object
to
such
a
measure
would
have
be
the
great
increase
of
all
her
own
comfort
.
<EOS>
She
think
he
be
really
good
-
tempered
,
and
could
fancy
his
entering
into
a
plan
of
that
sort
most
pleasantly
.
    
<EOS>
seven
week
of
the
two
month
be
very
nearly
go
,
when
the
one
letter
,
the
letter
from
Edmund
,
so
long
expect
,
be
put
into
Fanny
's
hand
.
<EOS>
as
she
open
,
and
see
its
length
,
she
prepare
herself
for
a
minute
detail
of
happiness
and
a
profusion
of
love
and
praise
towards
the
fortunate
creature
who
be
now
mistress
of
his
fate
.
<EOS>
these
be
the
content
    
<EOS>
"
My
Dear
Fanny
,
 
excuse
me
that
I
have
not
write
before
.
<EOS>
Crawford
tell
me
that
you
be
wish
to
hear
from
me
,
but
I
find
it
impossible
to
write
from
London
,
and
persuade
myself
that
you
would
understand
my
silence
.
<EOS>
Could
I
have
send
a
few
happy
line
,
they
should
not
have
be
want
,
but
nothing
of
that
nature
be
ever
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
I
be
return
to
Mansfield
in
a
less
assured
state
than
when
I
leave
it
.
<EOS>
My
hope
be
much
weak
.
<EOS>
You
be
probably
aware
of
this
already
.
<EOS>
so
very
fond
of
you
as
Miss
Crawford
be
,
it
be
most
natural
that
she
should
tell
you
enough
of
her
own
feeling
to
furnish
a
tolerable
guess
at
mine
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
be
prevent
,
however
,
from
make
my
own
communication
.
<EOS>
Our
confidence
in
you
need
not
clash
.
<EOS>
I
ask
no
question
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
soothe
in
the
idea
that
we
have
the
same
friend
,
and
that
whatever
unhappy
difference
of
opinion
may
exist
between
us
,
we
be
unite
in
our
love
of
you
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
comfort
to
me
to
tell
you
how
thing
now
be
,
and
what
be
my
present
plan
,
if
plan
I
can
be
say
to
have
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
return
since
Saturday
.
<EOS>
I
be
three
week
in
London
,
and
see
her
(
for
London
)
very
often
.
<EOS>
I
have
every
attention
from
the
Frasers
that
could
be
reasonably
expect
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
I
be
not
reasonable
in
carry
with
me
hope
of
an
intercourse
at
all
like
that
of
Mansfield
.
<EOS>
It
be
her
manner
,
however
,
rather
than
any
unfrequency
of
meeting
.
<EOS>
have
she
be
different
when
I
do
see
her
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
make
no
complaint
,
but
from
the
very
first
she
be
alter
:
my
first
reception
be
so
unlike
what
I
have
hope
,
that
I
have
almost
resolve
on
leave
London
again
directly
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
particularise
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
weak
side
of
her
character
,
and
may
imagine
the
sentiment
and
expression
which
be
torture
me
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
high
spirit
,
and
surround
by
those
who
be
give
all
the
support
of
their
own
bad
sense
to
her
too
lively
mind
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
Mrs.
Fraser
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
cold
-
hearted
,
vain
woman
,
who
have
marry
entirely
from
convenience
,
and
though
evidently
unhappy
in
her
marriage
,
place
her
disappointment
not
to
fault
of
judgment
,
or
temper
,
or
disproportion
of
age
,
but
to
her
being
,
after
all
,
less
affluent
than
many
of
her
acquaintance
,
especially
than
her
sister
,
Lady
Stornaway
,
and
be
the
determined
supporter
of
everything
mercenary
and
ambitious
,
provide
it
be
only
mercenary
and
ambitious
enough
.
<EOS>
I
look
upon
her
intimacy
with
those
two
sister
as
the
great
misfortune
of
her
life
and
mine
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
lead
her
astray
for
year
.
<EOS>
Could
she
be
detach
from
them
!
 
<EOS>
and
sometimes
I
do
not
despair
of
it
<EOS>
,
for
the
affection
appear
to
me
principally
on
their
side
.
<EOS>
They
be
very
fond
of
her
;
but
I
be
sure
she
do
not
love
them
as
she
love
you
.
<EOS>
when
I
think
of
her
great
attachment
to
you
,
indeed
,
and
the
whole
of
her
judicious
,
upright
conduct
as
a
sister
,
she
appear
a
very
different
creature
,
capable
of
everything
noble
,
and
I
be
ready
to
blame
myself
for
a
too
harsh
construction
of
a
playful
manner
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
give
her
up
,
Fanny
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
only
woman
in
the
world
whom
I
could
ever
think
of
as
a
wife
.
<EOS>
if
I
do
not
believe
that
she
have
some
regard
for
me
,
of
course
I
should
not
say
this
,
but
I
do
believe
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
convinced
that
she
be
not
without
a
decide
preference
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
jealousy
of
any
individual
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
influence
of
the
fashionable
world
altogether
that
I
be
jealous
of
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
habit
of
wealth
that
I
fear
.
<EOS>
Her
idea
be
not
high
than
her
own
fortune
may
warrant
,
but
they
be
beyond
what
our
income
united
could
authorise
.
<EOS>
there
be
comfort
,
however
,
even
here
.
<EOS>
I
could
better
bear
to
lose
her
because
not
rich
enough
,
than
because
of
my
profession
.
<EOS>
that
would
only
prove
her
affection
not
equal
to
sacrifice
,
which
,
in
fact
,
I
be
scarcely
justify
in
ask
;
and
,
if
I
be
refuse
,
that
,
I
think
,
will
be
the
honest
motive
.
<EOS>
Her
prejudice
,
I
trust
,
be
not
so
strong
as
they
be
.
<EOS>
You
have
my
thought
exactly
as
they
arise
,
my
dear
Fanny
;
perhaps
they
be
sometimes
contradictory
,
but
it
will
not
be
a
less
faithful
picture
of
my
mind
.
<EOS>
have
once
begin
,
it
be
a
pleasure
to
me
to
tell
you
all
I
feel
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
give
her
up
.
<EOS>
connect
as
we
already
be
,
and
,
I
hope
,
be
to
be
,
to
give
up
Mary
Crawford
would
be
to
give
up
the
society
of
some
of
those
most
dear
to
me
;
to
banish
myself
from
the
very
house
and
friend
whom
,
under
any
other
distress
,
I
should
turn
to
for
consolation
.
<EOS>
the
loss
of
Mary
I
must
consider
as
comprehend
the
loss
of
Crawford
and
of
Fanny
.
<EOS>
be
it
a
decide
thing
,
an
actual
refusal
<EOS>
,
I
hope
I
should
know
how
to
bear
it
,
and
how
to
endeavour
to
weaken
her
hold
on
my
heart
,
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
year
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
write
nonsense
.
<EOS>
be
I
refuse
,
I
must
bear
it
;
and
till
I
be
,
I
can
never
cease
to
try
for
her
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
truth
.
<EOS>
the
only
question
be
_
how
_
?
<EOS>
what
may
be
the
likeliest
mean
?
<EOS>
I
have
sometimes
think
of
go
to
London
again
after
Easter
,
and
sometimes
resolve
on
do
nothing
till
she
return
to
Mansfield
.
<EOS>
even
now
,
she
speak
with
pleasure
of
be
in
Mansfield
in
June
;
but
June
be
at
a
great
distance
,
and
I
believe
I
shall
write
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
nearly
determine
on
explain
myself
by
letter
.
<EOS>
to
be
at
an
early
certainty
be
a
material
object
.
<EOS>
My
present
state
be
miserably
irksome
.
<EOS>
consider
everything
,
I
think
a
letter
will
be
decidedly
the
good
method
of
explanation
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
able
to
write
much
that
I
could
not
say
,
and
shall
be
give
her
time
for
reflection
before
she
resolve
on
her
answer
,
and
I
be
less
afraid
of
the
result
of
reflection
than
of
an
immediate
hasty
impulse
<EOS>
;
I
think
I
be
.
<EOS>
My
great
danger
would
lie
in
her
consulting
Mrs.
Fraser
,
and
I
at
a
distance
unable
to
help
my
own
cause
.
<EOS>
a
letter
expose
to
all
the
evil
of
consultation
,
and
where
the
mind
be
anything
short
of
perfect
decision
,
an
adviser
may
,
in
an
unlucky
moment
,
lead
it
to
do
what
it
may
afterwards
regret
.
<EOS>
I
must
think
this
matter
over
a
little
.
<EOS>
this
long
letter
,
full
of
my
own
concern
alone
,
will
be
enough
to
tire
even
the
friendship
of
a
Fanny
.
<EOS>
the
last
time
I
see
Crawford
be
at
Mrs.
Fraser
's
party
.
<EOS>
I
be
more
and
more
satisfied
with
all
that
I
see
and
hear
of
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
shadow
of
wavering
.
<EOS>
He
thoroughly
know
his
own
mind
,
and
act
up
to
his
resolution
:
an
inestimable
quality
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
see
him
and
my
eld
sister
in
the
same
room
without
recollect
what
you
once
tell
me
,
and
I
acknowledge
that
they
do
not
meet
as
friend
.
<EOS>
there
be
mark
coolness
on
her
side
.
<EOS>
They
scarcely
speak
.
<EOS>
I
see
him
draw
back
surprised
,
and
I
be
sorry
that
Mrs.
Rushworth
should
resent
any
former
suppose
slight
to
Miss
Bertram
.
<EOS>
You
will
wish
to
hear
my
opinion
of
Maria
's
degree
of
comfort
as
a
wife
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
appearance
of
unhappiness
.
<EOS>
I
hope
they
get
on
pretty
well
together
.
<EOS>
I
dine
twice
in
Wimpole
Street
,
and
may
have
be
there
oftener
,
but
it
be
mortify
to
be
with
Rushworth
as
a
brother
.
<EOS>
Julia
seem
to
enjoy
London
exceedingly
.
<EOS>
I
have
little
enjoyment
there
,
but
have
less
here
.
<EOS>
We
be
not
a
lively
party
.
<EOS>
You
be
very
much
want
.
<EOS>
I
miss
you
more
than
I
can
express
.
<EOS>
My
mother
desire
her
good
love
,
and
hope
to
hear
from
you
soon
.
<EOS>
She
talk
of
you
almost
every
hour
,
and
I
be
sorry
to
find
how
many
week
more
she
be
likely
to
be
without
you
.
<EOS>
My
father
mean
to
fetch
you
himself
,
but
it
will
not
be
till
after
Easter
,
when
he
have
business
in
town
.
<EOS>
You
be
happy
at
Portsmouth
,
I
hope
,
but
this
must
not
be
a
yearly
visit
.
<EOS>
I
want
you
at
home
,
that
I
may
have
your
opinion
about
Thornton
Lacey
.
<EOS>
I
have
little
heart
for
extensive
improvement
till
I
know
that
it
will
ever
have
a
mistress
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
shall
certainly
write
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
settle
that
the
Grants
go
to
Bath
;
they
leave
Mansfield
on
Monday
.
<EOS>
I
be
glad
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
comfortable
enough
to
be
fit
for
anybody
;
but
your
aunt
seem
to
feel
out
of
luck
that
such
an
article
of
Mansfield
news
should
fall
to
my
pen
instead
of
hers
.
 
<EOS>
yours
<EOS>
ever
,
my
dear
Fanny
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
will
,
no

,
I
certainly
never
will
wish
for
a
letter
again

be
Fanny
's
secret
declaration
as
she
finish
this
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
they
bring
but
disappointment
and
sorrow
?
<EOS>
not
till
after
Easter
!
<EOS>
how
shall
I
bear
it
?
<EOS>
and
my
poor
aunt
talk
of
me
every
hour
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
check
the
tendency
of
these
thought
as
well
as
she
could
,
but
she
be
within
half
a
minute
of
start
the
idea
that
Sir
Thomas
be
quite
unkind
,
both
to
her
aunt
and
to
herself
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
main
subject
of
the
letter
,
there
be
nothing
in
that
to
soothe
irritation
.
<EOS>
She
be
almost
vexed
into
displeasure
and
anger
against
Edmund
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
good
in
this
delay
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
why
be
not
it
settle
?
<EOS>
He
be
blind
,
and
nothing
will
open
his
eye
;
<EOS>
nothing
can
,
after
have
have
truth
before
him
so
long
in
vain
.
<EOS>
He
will
marry
her
,
and
be
poor
and
miserable
.
<EOS>
God
grant
that
her
influence
do
not
make
him
cease
to
be
respectable
!
"
<EOS>
She
look
over
the
letter
again
.
"
<EOS>
"
so
very
fond
of
me
!
"
<EOS>

tis
nonsense
all

<EOS>
She
love
nobody
but
herself
and
her
brother
.
<EOS>
Her
friend

her
astray
for
year
!
<EOS>
She
be
quite
as
likely
to
have
lead
_
them
_
astray
.
<EOS>
They
have
all
,
perhaps
,
be
corrupt
one
another
;
but
if
they
be
so
much
fonder
of
her
than
she
be
of
them
,
she
be
the
less
likely
to
have
be
hurt
,
except
by
their
flattery

only
woman

the
world
whom
he
could
ever
think
of
as
a
wife

firmly
believe
it

It
be
an
attachment
to

whole
life

the

such

at
a
time
when
she
could
make

admit

it
must
have
be
very
mortifying
to
her
to
see
it
fall
to
the
share
of
her
thankless
son

treat
as
concisely
as
possible
at

herself
a

creditable

common

amplify

so
that
a
very
little
matter
be
enough
for
her

she
could
not
do
entirely
without
any
;
she
must
have
something
to
write
about
,
even
to
her
niece

so
soon
to
lose
all
the
benefit
of
Dr.
Grant

gouty
symptom
and
Mrs.

morning
call

very
hard

I
make
no

will
give
you
much

go
from
London
with
a
party
of
young
man
to
Newmarket
,
where
a
neglect
fall
and
a
good
deal
of
drinking
have
bring
on
a
fever
;
and
when
the
party
break
up
,
be
unable
to
move
,
have
be
leave
by
himself
at
the
house
of
one
of
these
young
man
to
the
comfort
of
sickness
and
solitude
,
and
the
attendance
only
of
servant
.
<EOS>
instead
of
be
soon
well
enough
to
follow
his
friend
,
as
he
have
then
hope
,
his
disorder
increase
considerably
,
and
it
be
not
long
before
he
think
so
ill
of
himself
as
to
be
as
ready
as
his
physician
to
have
a
letter
despatch
to
Mansfield
.

<EOS>
this
distress
intelligence
,
as
you
may
suppose
,

observe
her
ladyship
,
after
give
the
substance
of
it
,
"
have
agitate
us
exceedingly
,
and
we
can
not
prevent
ourselves
from
be
greatly
alarmed
and
apprehensive
for
the
poor
invalid
,
<EOS>
whose
state
Sir
Thomas
fear
may
be
very
critical
;
and
Edmund
kindly
propose
attend
his
brother
immediately
,
but
I
be
happy
to
add
that
Sir
Thomas
will
not
leave
me
on
this
distress
occasion
,
as
it
would
be
too
try
for
me
.
<EOS>
We
shall
greatly
miss
Edmund
in
our
small
circle
,
but
I
trust
and
hope
he
will
find
the
poor
invalid
in
a
less
alarming
state
than
may
be
apprehend
,
and
that
he
will
be
able
to
bring
him
to
Mansfield
shortly
,
which
Sir
Thomas
propose
should
be
do
,
and
think
best
on
every
account
,
and
I
flatter
myself
<EOS>
the
poor
sufferer
will
soon
be
able
to
bear
the
removal
without
material
inconvenience
or
injury
.
<EOS>
as
I
have
little
doubt
of
your
feeling
for
us
,
my
dear
Fanny
,
under
these
distress
circumstance
,
I
will
write
again
very
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
's
feeling
on
the
occasion
be
indeed
considerably
more
warm
and
genuine
than
her
aunt
's
style
of
writing
.
<EOS>
She
feel
truly
for
them
all
.
<EOS>
Tom
dangerously
ill
,
Edmund
go
to
attend
him
,
and
the
sadly
small
party
remain
at
Mansfield
,
be
care
to
shut
out
every
other
care
,
or
almost
every
other
.
<EOS>
She
could
just
find
selfishness
enough
to
wonder
whether
Edmund
_
have
_
write
to
Miss
Crawford
before
this
summon
come
,
but
no
sentiment
dwelt
long
with
her
that
be
not
purely
affectionate
and
disinterestedly
anxious
.
<EOS>
Her
aunt
do
not
neglect
her
:
she
write
again
and
again
;
they
be
receive
frequent
account
from
Edmund
,
and
these
account
be
as
regularly
transmit
to
Fanny
,
in
the
same
diffuse
style
,
and
the
same
medley
of
trust
,
hope
,
and
fear
,
all
follow
and
produce
each
other
at
haphazard
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
sort
of
playing
at
be
frighten
.
<EOS>
the
suffering
which
Lady
Bertram
do
not
see
have
little
power
over
her
fancy
;
and
she
write
very
comfortably
about
agitation
,
and
anxiety
,
and
poor
invalid
,
till
Tom
be
actually
convey
to
Mansfield
,
and
her
own
eye
have
behold
his
altered
appearance
.
<EOS>
then
a
letter
which
she
have
be
previously
prepare
for
Fanny
be
finish
in
a
different
style
,
in
the
language
of
real
feeling
and
alarm
;
then
she
write
as
she
may
have
speak
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
just
come
,
my
dear
Fanny

be
take
upstairs

I
be
so
shocked
to
see
him
,
that
I
do
not
know
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
he
have
be
very
ill

<EOS>
poor
Tom
!
<EOS>
I
be
quite
grieve
for
him
,
and
very
much
frightened

and
so
be
Sir
Thomas
;
and
<EOS>
how
glad
I
should
be
if
you
be
here
to
comfort
me
.
<EOS>
but
Sir
Thomas
hope
he
will
be
well
to

and
say
we
must
consider
his
journey

<EOS>
the
real
solicitude
now
awaken
in
the
maternal
bosom
be
not
soon
over
.
<EOS>
Tom
's
extreme
impatience
to
be
remove
to
Mansfield
,
and
experience
those
comfort
of
home
and
family
which
have
be
little
think
of
in
uninterrupted
health
,
have
probably
induce
his
be
convey
thither
too
early
,
as
a
return
of
fever
come
on
,
and
for
a
week
he
be
in
a
more
alarming
state
than
ever
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
very
seriously
frightened

<EOS>
Lady
Bertram
write
her
daily
terror
to
her
niece

who
may
now
be
say
to
live
upon
letter

pass
all

from

without
any
particular
affection
for
her

her
tenderness
of
heart
make
her
feel
that
she
could
not

him
,
and
the
purity
of
her
principle
add
yet
a
keen
solicitude
,
when
she
consider
how
little
useful

how
little
self

(
apparently
)
be

<EOS>
Susan
be
her
only
companion
and
listener
on
this
,
as
on
more
common
occasion
.
<EOS>
Susan
be
always
ready
to
hear
and
to
sympathise

<EOS>
nobody
else
could
be
interested
in
so
remote
an
evil
as
illness
in
a
family
above
an
hundred
mile
off
;
not
even
Mrs.
Price
,
beyond
a
brief
question
or
two
,
if
she
see
her
daughter
with
a
letter
in
her
hand

and
now
and
then
the
quiet
observation
of

"
My
poor
sister
Bertram

be
in
a
great
deal
of
trouble

"
  
<EOS>
so
long
divide
and
so
differently
situate

the
tie

blood
be
little
more
than
nothing

<EOS>
an
attachment
,
originally
as
tranquil
as
their
temper
,
be
now
become
a
mere
name

<EOS>
Mrs.
Price
do
quite
as
much
for
Lady
Bertram
as
Lady
Bertram
would
have
do
for
Mrs.
Price
.
<EOS>
three
or
four
price
may
have
be
sweep
away
,
any
or
all
except
Fanny
and
William

and
Lady
Bertram
would
have
think
little
about
it
;
or
perhaps
may
have
catch
from
Mrs.
Norris
's
lip
the
can
not
of
its
be
a
very
happy
thing
and
a
great
blessing
to
their
poor
dear
sister
Price
<EOS>
to
have
them
so
well
provide
for
.
    
<EOS>
at
about
the
week
's
end
from
his
return
to
Mansfield
,
Tom
's
immediate
danger
be
over
,
and
he
be
so
far
pronounce
safe
as
to
make
his
mother
perfectly
easy
;
for
be
now
use
to
the
sight
of
him
in
his
suffering
,
helpless
state
,
and
hear
only
the
good
,
and
never
think
beyond
what
she
hear
,
with
no
disposition
for
alarm
and
no
aptitude
at
a
hint
,
Lady
Bertram
be
the
happy
subject
in
the
world
for
a
little
medical
imposition
.
<EOS>
the
fever
be
subdue
;
the
fever
have
be
his
complaint
;
of
course
he
would
soon
be
well
again
.
<EOS>
Lady
Bertram
could
think
nothing
less
,
and
Fanny
share
her
aunt
's
security
,
till
she
receive
a
few
line
from
Edmund
,
write
purposely
to
give
her
a
clear
idea
of
his
brother
's
situation
,
and
acquaint
her
with
the
apprehension
which
he
and
his
father
have
imbibe
from
the
physician
with
respect
to
some
strong
hectic
symptom
,
which
seem
to
seize
the
frame
on
the
departure
of
the
fever
.
<EOS>
They
judge
it
good
that
Lady
Bertram
should
not
be
harass
by
alarm
which
,
it
be
to
be
hope
,
would
prove
unfounded
;
but
there
be
no
reason
why
Fanny
should
not
know
the
truth
.
<EOS>
They
be
apprehensive
for
his
lung
.
  
<EOS>
a
very
few
line
from
Edmund
shew
her
the
patient
and
the
sickroom
in
a
juster
and
strong
light
than
all
Lady
Bertram
's
sheet
of
paper
could
do
.
<EOS>
there
be
hardly
any
one
in
the
house
who
may
not
have
describe
,
from
personal
observation
,
well
than
herself
;
not
one
who
be
not
more
useful
at
time
to
her
son
.
<EOS>
She
could
do
nothing
but
glide
in
quietly
and
look
at
him
;
but
when
able
to
talk
or
be
talk
to
,
or
read
to
,
Edmund
be
the
companion
he
prefer
.
<EOS>
His
aunt
worry
him
by
her
care
,
and
Sir
Thomas
know
not
how
to
bring
down
his
conversation
or
his
voice
to
the
level
of
irritation
and
feebleness
.
<EOS>
Edmund
be
all
in
all
.
<EOS>
Fanny
would
certainly
believe
him
so
at
least
,
and
must
find
that
her
estimation
of
him
be
high
than
ever
when
he
appear
as
the
attendant
,
supporter
,
cheerer
of
a
suffer
brother
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
only
the
debility
of
recent
illness
to
assist
:
there
be
also
,
as
she
now
learn
,
nerve
much
affected
,
spirit
much
depressed
to
calm
and
raise
,
and
her
own
imagination
add
that
there
must
be
a
mind
to
be
properly
guide
.
  
<EOS>
the
family
be
not
consumptive
,
and
she
be
more
inclined
to
hope
than
fear
for
her
cousin
,
except
when
she
think
of
Miss
Crawford
;
but
Miss
Crawford
give
her
the
idea
of
be
the
child
of
good
luck
,
and
to
her
selfishness
and
vanity
it
would
be
good
luck
to
have
Edmund
the
only
son
.
  
<EOS>
even
in
the
sick
chamber
the
fortunate
Mary
be
not
forget
.
<EOS>
Edmund
's
letter
have
this
postscript
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
on
the
subject
of
my
last
,
I
have
actually
begin
a
letter
when
call
away
by
Tom
's
illness
,
but
I
have
now
change
my
mind
,
and
fear
to
trust
the
influence
of
friend
.
<EOS>
when
Tom
be
well
,
I
shall
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
state
of
Mansfield
,
and
so
it
continue
,
with
scarcely
any
change
,
till
Easter
.
<EOS>
a
line
occasionally
add
by
Edmund
to
his
mother
's
letter
be
enough
for
Fanny
's
information
.
<EOS>
Tom
's
amendment
be
alarmingly
slow
.
  
<EOS>
Easter
come
particularly
late
this
year
,
as
Fanny
have
most
sorrowfully
consider
,
on
first
learning
that
she
have
no
chance
of
leave
Portsmouth
till
after
it
.
<EOS>
It
come
,
and
she
have
yet
hear
nothing
of
her
return
 
nothing
even
of
the
go
to
London
,
which
be
to
precede
her
return
.
<EOS>
Her
aunt
often
express
a
wish
for
her
,
but
there
be
no
notice
,
no
message
from
the
uncle
on
whom
all
depend
.
<EOS>
She
suppose
he
could
not
yet
leave
his
son
,
but
it
be
a
cruel
,
a
terrible
delay
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
end
of
April
be
come
on
;
it
would
soon
be
almost
three
month
,
instead
of
two
,
that
she
have
be
absent
from
them
all
,
and
that
her
day
have
be
pass
in
a
state
of
penance
,
which
she
love
them
too
well
to
hope
they
would
thoroughly
understand
;
and
who
could
yet
say
when
there
may
be
leisure
to
think
of
or
fetch
her
?
  
<EOS>
Her
eagerness
,
her
impatience
,
her
longing
to
be
with
them
,
be
such
as
to
bring
a
line
or
two
of
Cowper
's
Tirocinium
for
ever
before
her
.
"
<EOS>
with
what
intense
desire
she
want
her
home
,
"
be
continually
on
her
tongue
,
as
the
true
description
of
a
yearning
which
she
could
not
suppose
any
schoolboy
's
bosom
to
feel
more
keenly
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
have
be
come
to
Portsmouth
,
she
have
love
to
call
it
her
home
,
have
be
fond
of
say
that
she
be
go
home
;
the
word
have
be
very
dear
to
her
,
and
so
it
still
be
,
but
it
must
be
apply
to
Mansfield
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
that
_
be
now
the
home
.
<EOS>
Portsmouth
be
Portsmouth
;
Mansfield
be
home
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
long
so
arrange
in
the
indulgence
of
her
secret
meditation
,
and
nothing
be
more
consolatory
to
her
than
to
find
her
aunt
use
the
same
language
:
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
but
say
I
much
regret
your
being
from
home
at
this
distress
time
,
so
very
try
to
my
spirit
.
<EOS>
I
trust
and
hope
,
and
sincerely
wish
you
may
never
be
absent
from
home
<EOS>
so
long
again
,
"
be
most
delightful
sentence
to
her
.
<EOS>
still
,
however
,
it
be
her
private
regale
.
<EOS>
delicacy
to
her
parent
make
her
careful
not
to
betray
such
a
preference
of
her
uncle
's
house
.
<EOS>
It
be
always
:
"
when
I
go
back
into
Northamptonshire
,
or
when
I
return
to
Mansfield
,
I
shall
do
so
and
so
.
<EOS>
"
for
a
great
while
it
be
so
,
but
at
last
the
longing
grow
strong
,
it
overthrow
caution
,
and
she
find
herself
talk
of
what
she
should
do
when
she
go
home
before
she
be
aware
.
<EOS>
She
reproach
herself
,
colour
,
and
look
fearfully
towards
her
father
and
mother
.
<EOS>
She
nee
not
have
be
uneasy
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
sign
of
displeasure
,
or
even
of
hear
her
.
<EOS>
They
be
perfectly
free
from
any
jealousy
of
Mansfield
.
<EOS>
She
be
as
welcome
to
wish
herself
there
as
to
be
there
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
sad
to
Fanny
to
lose
all
the
pleasure
of
spring
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
know
before
what
pleasure
she
_
have
_
to
lose
in
pass
March
and
April
in
a
town
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
know
before
how
much
the
beginning
and
progress
of
vegetation
have
delight
her
.
<EOS>
what
animation
,
both
of
body
and
mind
,
she
have
derive
from
watch
the
advance
of
that
season
which
can
not
,
in
spite
of
its
capriciousness
,
be
unlovely
,
and
see
its
increase
beauty
from
the
early
flower
in
the
warm
division
of
her
aunt
's
garden
,
to
the
opening
of
leave
of
her
uncle
's
plantation
,
and
the
glory
of
his
wood
.
<EOS>
to
be
lose
such
pleasure
be
no
trifle
;
to
be
lose
them
,
because
she
be
in
the
midst
of
closeness
and
noise
,
to
have
confinement
,
bad
air
,
bad
smell
,
substitute
for
liberty
,
freshness
,
fragrance
,
and
verdure
,
be
infinitely
bad
:
but
even
these
incitement
to
regret
be
feeble
,
compare
with
what
arise
from
the
conviction
of
be
miss
by
her
good
friend
,
and
the
longing
to
be
useful
to
those
who
be
want
her
!
  
<EOS>
Could
she
have
be
at
home
,
she
may
have
be
of
service
to
every
creature
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
she
must
have
be
of
use
to
all
.
<EOS>
to
all
she
must
have
save
some
trouble
of
head
or
hand
;
and
be
it
only
in
support
the
spirit
of
her
aunt
Bertram
,
keep
her
from
the
evil
of
solitude
,
or
the
still
great
evil
of
a
restless
,
officious
companion
,
too
apt
to
be
heighten
danger
in
order
to
enhance
her
own
importance
,
her
be
there
would
have
be
a
general
good
.
<EOS>
She
love
to
fancy
how
she
could
have
read
to
her
aunt
<EOS>
,
how
she
could
have
talk
to
her
,
and
try
at
once
to
make
her
feel
the
blessing
of
what
be
,
and
prepare
her
mind
for
what
may
be
;
and
how
many
walk
up
and
down
stair
she
may
have
save
her
,
and
how
many
message
she
may
have
carry
.
  
<EOS>
It
astonish
her
that
Tom
's
sister
could
be
satisfied
with
remain
in
London
at
such
a
time
,
through
an
illness
which
have
now
,
under
different
degree
of
danger
,
last
several
week
.
<EOS>
_
They
_
may
return
to
Mansfield
when
they
choose
;
travel
could
be
no
difficulty
to
_
them
_
,
and
she
could
not
comprehend
how
both
could
still
keep
away
.
<EOS>
if
Mrs.
Rushworth
could
imagine
any
interfere
obligation
,
Julia
be
certainly
able
to
quit
London
whenever
she
choose
.
<EOS>
It
appear
from
one
of
her
aunt
's
letter
that
Julia
have
offer
to
return
if
want
,
but
this
be
all
.
<EOS>
It
be
evident
that
she
would
rather
remain
where
she
be
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
be
dispose
to
think
the
influence
of
London
very
much
at
war
with
all
respectable
attachment
.
<EOS>
She
see
the
proof
of
it
in
Miss
Crawford
,
as
well
as
in
her
cousin
;
_
her
_
attachment
to
Edmund
have
be
respectable
,
the
most
respectable
part
of
her
character
;
her
friendship
for
herself
have
at
least
be
blameless
.
<EOS>
where
be
either
sentiment
now
?
<EOS>
It
be
so
long
since
Fanny
have
have
any
letter
from
her
,
that
she
have
some
reason
to
think
lightly
of
the
friendship
which
have
be
so
dwell
on
.
<EOS>
It
be
week
since
she
have
hear
anything
of
Miss
Crawford
or
of
her
other
connexion
in
town
,
except
through
Mansfield
,
and
she
be
begin
to
suppose
that
she
may
never
know
whether
Mr.
Crawford
have
go
into
Norfolk
again
or
not
till
they
meet
,
and
may
never
hear
from
his
sister
any
more
this
spring
,
when
the
follow
letter
be
receive
to
revive
old
and
create
some
new
sensation
    
<EOS>
"
forgive
me
,
my
dear
Fanny
,
as
soon
as
you
can
,
for
my
long
silence
,
and
behave
as
if
you
could
forgive
me
directly
.
<EOS>
this
be
my
modest
request
and
expectation
,
for
you
be
so
good
,
that
I
depend
upon
be
treat
better
than
I
deserve
,
and
I
write
now
to
beg
an
immediate
answer
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
the
state
of
thing
at
Mansfield
Park
,
and
you
,
no
doubt
,
be
perfectly
able
to
give
it
.
<EOS>
one
should
be
a
brute
not
to
feel
for
the
distress
they
be
in
;
and
from
what
I
hear
,
poor
Mr.
Bertram
have
a
bad
chance
of
ultimate
recovery
.
<EOS>
I
think
little
of
his
illness
at
first
.
<EOS>
I
look
upon
him
as
the
sort
of
person
to
be
make
a
fuss
with
,
and
to
make
a
fuss
himself
in
any
trifling
disorder
,
and
be
chiefly
concerned
for
those
who
have
to
nurse
him
;
but
now
it
be
confidently
assert
that
he
be
really
in
a
decline
,
that
the
symptom
be
most
alarming
,
and
that
part
of
the
family
,
at
least
,
be
aware
of
it
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
so
,
I
be
sure
you
must
be
include
in
that
part
,
that
discern
part
,
and
therefore
entreat
you
to
let
me
know
how
far
I
have
be
rightly
inform
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
say
how
rejoice
I
shall
be
to
hear
there
have
be
any
mistake
,
but
the
report
be
so
prevalent
that
I
confess
I
can
not
help
tremble
.
<EOS>
to
have
such
a
fine
young
man
cut
off
in
the
flower
of
his
day
be
most
melancholy
.
<EOS>
Poor
Sir
Thomas
will
feel
it
dreadfully
.
<EOS>
I
really
be
quite
agitated
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Fanny
,
Fanny
,
I
see
you
smile
and
look
cunning
,
but
,
upon
my
honour
,
I
never
bribe
a
physician
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
poor
young
man
!
<EOS>
if
he
be
to
die
,
there
will
be
_
two
_
poor
young
man
less
in
the
world
;
and
with
a
fearless
face
and
bold
voice
would
I
say
to
any
one
,
that
wealth
and
consequence
could
fall
into
no
hand
more
deserving
of
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
foolish
precipitation
last
Christmas
,
but
the
evil
of
a
few
day
may
be
blot
out
in
part

and
gilding

many

It
will
be
but
the
loss
of
the

to

of
my

not

me
the

it
from
the
fountainhead

now

do
not

put
it
to
your

Sir

I
would
not

trouble
you

you

now
the

I
can
apply
to
for
the
truth

his

<EOS>
Mrs.

have
be
spend
the
Easter
with
the
aylmer
at
Twickenham
(
as
to
be
sure
you
know
)
,
and
be
not
yet
return
;
and
Julia
be
with
the
cousin
who
live
near
Bedford
Square
,
but
I
forget
their
name
and
street
.
<EOS>
Could
I
immediately
apply
to
either
,
however
,
I
should
still
prefer
you
,
because
it
strike
me
that
they
have
all
along
be
so
unwilling
to
have
their
own
amusement
cut
up
,
as
to
shut
their
eye
to
the
truth

<EOS>
I
suppose
Mrs.

Easter
holiday
will
not
last
much
longer
;
no

they
be
thorough
holiday
to
her
.
<EOS>
the

be
pleasant

and
her
husband
away

she
can
have
nothing

enjoyment

<EOS>
I
give
her
credit
for
promote
his
go
dutifully
down
to
Bath

to
fetch
his
mother

but
how
will
she
and
the
dowager
agree
in
one
house
?
<EOS>
Henry
be
not
at

so
I
have
nothing

from
him

for
this
illness

what

at

Dear

write

Mansfield
Park

<EOS>
It
would
really
be
gratify
to
see
them
all
again
,
and
a
little
addition
of
society
may
be
of
infinite
use

you
must

I

half
Henry

<EOS>
Fanny
's
disgust
at
the
great
part
of
this
letter
,
with
her
extreme
reluctance
to
bring
the
writer
of
it
and
her
cousin
Edmund
together
,
would
have
make
her
(
as

)
incapable
of
judge
impartially
whether
the
conclude
offer

be
accept

not

<EOS>
to
herself

individually

it

most
tempting

<EOS>
to
be
find
herself
,
perhaps
within
three
day
,
transport
to
Mansfield
,
be
an
image
of
the
great
felicity
,
but
it
would
have
be
a
material
drawback
to
be
owe
such
felicity
to
person
in
whose
feeling
and
conduct
,
at
the
present
moment
,
she
see
so
much
to
condemn
:
the
sister
's
feeling
,
the
brother
's
conduct
,
_
<EOS>
her
_
cold

hearted
ambition
,
_
his

to
have
him
still
the
acquaintance

the
flirt
perhaps
,
of
Mrs.
Rushworth

<EOS>
She
be
mortify

<EOS>
She
have
think
better
of
him

<EOS>
happily
,
however
,
she
be
not
leave
to
weigh
and
decide
between
opposite
inclination
and
doubtful
notion
of
right
;
there
be
no
occasion
to
determine
whether
she
ought
to
keep
Edmund
and
Mary
asunder
or
not

<EOS>
She
have
a
rule
to
apply
to
,
which
settle
everything
.
<EOS>
Her
awe
of
her

her
dread
of
take
a
liberty
with
him
,
make
it
instantly
plain
to
her
what
she

<EOS>
She
must
absolutely
decline
the
proposal

<EOS>
if
he
want
,
he
would
send
for

and
even
to
offer
an

hardly
anything

negative

so
many
week
without

she
must
suppose
her

an
encumbrance

"
  
<EOS>
Her
representation
of
her
cousin
's
state
at
this
time
be
exactly
accord
to
her
own
belief
of
it

and
such
as
she
suppose
would
convey
to
the
sanguine
mind
of
her

the
hope

everything

Edmund
would
be
forgive
for
be
a
clergyman
,
it
seem
,
under
certain
condition
of
wealth

and
this
,
she
suspect
,
be
all
the
conquest
of
prejudice
which
he
be
so
ready

himself
upon

She
have
only
learn
to

money

as
Fanny
could
not

that

she

from

no

she
could
instantly
decide
on
its
contain
little
writing

be
persuade
of
its
have
the
air
of
a
letter
of
haste

business

<EOS>
Its
object
be
unquestionable
;
and
two
moment
be
enough
to
start
the
probability
of
its
be
merely
to
give
her
notice
that
they
should

to

the

that
a

Fanny
stand
aghast

<EOS>
as
no
scandalous
,
ill
-
natured
rumour
have
reach
her
,
it
be
impossible
for
her
to
understand
much
of
this
strange
letter
.
<EOS>
She
could
only
perceive
that
it
must
relate
to
Wimpole
Street
and
Mr.
Crawford
,
and
only
conjecture
that
something
very
imprudent
have
just
occur
in
that
quarter
to
draw
the
notice
of
the
world
,
and
to
excite
her
jealousy
,
in
Miss

apprehension

if
she

Miss
Crawford
nee
not

her

<EOS>
She
be
only
sorry
for
the
party
concern

for
Mansfield
,
if
the
report
should
spread
so
far
;
but
she
hope
it
may
not

<EOS>
if
the
rushworth
be
go
themselves
to
Mansfield
,
as
be
to
be
infer
from
what
Miss
Crawford
say
,
it
be
not
likely
that
anything
unpleasant
should
have
precede
them
,
or
at
least
should
make
any
impression
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
Mr.
Crawford
,
she
hope
it
may
give
him
a
knowledge
of
his
own
disposition
,
convince
him
that
he
be
not
capable
of
be
steadily
attach
to
any
one
woman
in
the
world
,
and
shame
him
from
persist
any
longer
in
address
herself
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
very
strange
!
<EOS>
She
have
begin
to
think
he
really
love
her
,
and
to
fancy
his
affection
for
her
something
more
than
common
;
and
his
sister
still
say
that
he
care
for
nobody
else

<EOS>
yet
there
must
have
be
some
marked
display
of
attention
to
her
cousin
,
there
must
have
be
some
strong
indiscretion
,
since
her
correspondent
be
not
of

very
uncomfortable
she
be
,

must

from
Miss
Crawford
again
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
banish
the
letter
from
her
thought
,
and
she
could
not
relieve
herself
by
speak
of
it
to
any
human
being
.
<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
nee
not
have
urge
secrecy
with
so
much
warmth
;
she
may
have
trust
to
her
sense
of
what
be
due
to
her
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
come
and
bring
no
second
letter
.
<EOS>
Fanny
be
disappoint
.
<EOS>
She
could
still
think
of
little
else
all
the
morning
;
but
,
when
her
father
come
back
in
the
afternoon
with
the
daily
newspaper
as
usual
,
she
be
so
far
from
expect
any
elucidation
through
such
a
channel
that
the
subject
be
for
a
moment
out
of
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
deep
in
other
musing
.
<EOS>
the
remembrance
of
her
first
evening
in
that
room
,
of
her
father
and
his
newspaper
,
come
across
her
.
<EOS>
no
candle
be
now
want
.
<EOS>
the
sun
be
yet
an
hour
and
half
above
the
horizon
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
she
have
,
indeed
,
be
three
month
there
;
and
the
sun
's
ray
fall
strongly
into
the
parlour
,
instead
of
cheer
,
make
her
still
more
melancholy
,
for
sunshine
appear
to
her
a
totally
different
thing
in
a
town
and
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
here
,
its
power
be
only
a
glare
:
a
stifle
,
sickly
glare
,
serve
but
to
bring
forward
stain
and
dirt
that
may
otherwise
have
sleep
.
<EOS>
there
be
neither
health
nor
gaiety
in
sunshine
in
a
town
.
<EOS>
She
sit
in
a
blaze
of
oppressive
heat
,
in
a
cloud
of
move
dust
,
and
her
eye
could
only
wander
from
the
wall
,
mark
by
her
father
's
head
,
to
the
table
cut
and
notch
by
her
brother
,
where
stand
the
tea
-
board
never
thoroughly
clean
,
the
cup
and
saucer
wipe
in
streak
,
<EOS>
the
milk
a
mixture
of
mote
float
in
thin
blue
,
and
the
bread
and
butter
grow
every
minute
more
greasy
than
even
Rebecca
's
hand
have
first
produce
it
.
<EOS>
Her
father
read
his
newspaper
,
and
her
mother
lament
over
the
ragged
carpet
as
usual
,
while
the
tea
be
in
preparation
,
and
wish
Rebecca
would
mend
it
;
and
Fanny
be
first
rouse
by
his
call
out
to
her
,
after
humphe
and
consider
over
a
particular
paragraph
:
"
what
be
the
name
of
your
great
cousin
in
town
,
Fan
?
"
  
<EOS>
a
moment
's
recollection
enable
her
to
say
,
"
Rushworth
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
not
they
live
in
Wimpole
Street
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
there
be
the
devil
to
pay
among
them
,
that
be
all
!
<EOS>
there
"
(
hold
out
the
paper
to
her
)
;
"
much
good
may
such
fine
relation
do
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
Sir
Thomas
may
think
of
such
matter
;
he
may
be
too
much
of
the
courtier
and
fine
gentleman
to
like
his
daughter
the
less
.
<EOS>
but
,
by
G
 
!
<EOS>
if
she
belong
to
_
me
<EOS>
_
,
I
would
give
her
the
rope
's
end
as
long
as
I
could
stand
over
her
.
<EOS>
a
little
flogging
for
man
and
woman
too
would
be
the
good
way
of
prevent
such
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
read
to
herself
that
"
it
be
with
infinite
concern
the
newspaper
have
to
announce
to
the
world
a
matrimonial
_
fracas
_
in
the
family
of
Mr.
R.
of
Wimpole
Street
;
the
beautiful
Mrs.
R.

whose
name

not
long
be

list
of
Hymen

and
who
have
promise
to

so
brilliant
a
leader
in
the
fashionable
world

have
quit
her
husband

roof
in

with
the
well

know

captivate
Mr.

the

to
the

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
mistake
,
sir
,
"
say
Fanny
instantly
;
"
it
must
be
a
mistake
<EOS>
,
it
can
not
be
true
;
it
must
mean
some
other
people
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
speak
from
the
instinctive
wish
of
delay
shame
;
she
speak
with
a
resolution
which
spring
from
despair
,
for
she
speak
what
she
do
not
,
could
not
believe
herself
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
the
shock
of
conviction
as
she
read
.
<EOS>
the
truth
rush
on
her
;
and
how
she
could
have
speak
at
all
,
how
she
could
even
have
breathe
,
be
afterwards
matter
of
wonder
to
herself

<EOS>
Mr.
Price
care
too
little
about
the
report
to
make
her
much
answer

<EOS>
"
It
may
be
all
a
lie

he
acknowledge

but
so
many
fine

indeed

I
hope
it

say
Mrs.

plaintively
;

it
would
be
so
very
shocking
!
<EOS>
if
I
have
speak
once
to
Rebecca
about
that
carpet
,
I
be
sure
I
have
speak
at

a
dozen
time

Betsey

<EOS>
and
it
would

"
  
<EOS>
the
horror
of
a
mind
like
Fanny
's
,
as
it
receive
the
conviction
of
such
guilt
,
and
begin
to
take
in
some
part
of
the
misery
that
must
ensue
,
can
hardly
be
describe
.
<EOS>
at
first
,
it
be
a
sort
of
stupefaction
;
but
every
moment
be
quicken
her
perception
of
the
horrible
evil
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
doubt
,
she
dare
not
indulge
a
hope
,
of
the
paragraph

false

<EOS>
Miss
Crawford
's
letter
,
which
she
have
read
so
often
as
to
make
every
line
her

in
frightful
conformity

her
evident

be
all

something
very
bad
;

if
there
be
a
woman
of
character
in
existence
,
who
could
treat
as
a
trifle
this
sin
of
the
first
magnitude

who
would
try

gloss
it
over
,

have
it
unpunished

she
could
believe
Miss

sickness
to

from
hot

the
event
be
so
shocking

there

moment

Sir

high
sense
of
honour

decorum
,
Edmund

upright
principle

unsuspicious
temper

genuine
strength

make
her
think
it
scarcely
possible
for
them
to
support
life
and

under
such
disgrace

it

to
her

as

as

the
great

She
have

scarcely

reduce

so
low

her

little

the

hardly
have

than
visit
their
agitated
spirit
 
one

the

and
indescribable
perturbation

<EOS>
the

immediately
see

with
the
knowledge
of
what
he
must
be
suffer
,
bring
back
all
her
own
first
feeling

<EOS>
He

near

and
in
misery

<EOS>
She
be
ready
to
sink
as
she
enter
the
parlour

<EOS>
He
be
alone
,
and
meet
her
instantly
;
and
she
find
herself
press
to
his
heart
with
only
these
word
,
just
articulate
,
"
<EOS>
My
Fanny
,
my
only
sister
;
my
only
comfort
now

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
could
say
nothing
;
nor
for
some
minute
could
he
say
more
.
  
<EOS>
He
turn
away
to
recover
himself
,
and
when
he
speak
again
,
though
his
voice
still
falter
,
his
manner
shew
the
wish
of
self
-
command
,
and
the
resolution
of
avoid
any
farth
allusion

<EOS>
"
<EOS>

<EOS>
when
shall

question
follow
each
other
rapidly
.
<EOS>
His
great
object
be
to
be
off
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
when
Mansfield
be
consider
,
time
be
precious
;
and
the
state
of
his
own
mind
make
him
find
relief
only
in
motion
.
<EOS>
It
be
settle
that
he
should
order
the
carriage
to
the
door
in
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
Fanny
answer
for
their
have
breakfast
and
be
quite
ready
in
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
He
have
already
eat
,
and
decline
stay
for
their
meal
.
<EOS>
He
would
walk
round
the
rampart
,
and
join
them
with
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
again
;
glad
to
get
away
even
from
Fanny
.
  
<EOS>
He
look
very
ill
;
evidently
suffer
under
violent
emotion
,
which
he
be
determined
to
suppress
.
<EOS>
She
know
it
must
be
so
,
but
it
be
terrible
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
carriage
come
;
and
he
enter
the
house
again
at
the
same
moment
,
just
in
time
to
spend
a
few
minute
with
the
family
,
and
be
a
witness
 
but
that
he
see
nothing
 
of
the
tranquil
manner
in
which
the
daughter
be
part
with
,
and
just
in
time
to
prevent
their
sit
down
to
the
breakfast
-
table
,
which
,
by
dint
of
much
unusual
activity
,
be
quite
and
completely
ready
as
the
carriage
drive
from
the
door
.
<EOS>
Fanny
's
last
meal
in
her
father
's
house
be
in
character
with
her
first
:
she
be
dismiss
from
it
as
hospitably
as
she
have
be
welcome
.
  
<EOS>
how
her
heart
swell
with
joy
and
gratitude
as
she
pass
the
barrier
of
Portsmouth
,
and
how
Susan
's
face
wear
its
broad
smile
,
may
be
easily
conceive
.
<EOS>
sit
forwards
,
however
,
and
screen
by
her
bonnet

those
smile

unseen
.
  
<EOS>
the
journey
be
likely
to
be
a
silent
one
.
<EOS>
Edmund
's
deep
sigh
often
reach
Fanny
.
<EOS>
have
he
be
alone
with
her
,
his
heart
must
have
open
in
spite
of
every
resolution
;
but
Susan
's
presence
drive
him
quite
into
himself
,
and
his
attempt
to
talk
on
indifferent
subject
could
never
be
long
support
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
watch
him
with
never
-
fail
solicitude
,
and
sometimes
catch
his
eye
,
revive
an
affectionate
smile
,
which
comfort
her
;
but
the
first
day

journey
pass
without

a
word
from

on
the
subject
that

<EOS>
just
before

while
Susan

in
eager
observation
of

large
family
from

by
the
fire

and
Edmund

particularly
strike
by
the
alteration
in
Fanny

look
,
and
from
his
ignorance
of
the
daily
evil
of
her
father
's
house

attribute
an
undue
share
of
the
change
,
attribute

the
recent

take
her
hand
,
and
say
in
a
low
,
but
very
expressive
tone
,
"
<EOS>
no
wonder
 
<EOS>
you
must
feel
it
 
you
must
suffer
.
<EOS>
how
a
man
who
have
once
love
,
could
desert
you
!
<EOS>
but
_
yours
_
 
<EOS>
your
regard
be
new
compare

Fanny

think
of

"
  
<EOS>
the
first
division
of
their
journey
occupy
a
long
day
,
and
bring
them
,
almost
knock
up
,
to
Oxford
;
but
the
second
be
over
at
a
much
early
hour
.
<EOS>
They
be
in
the
environ
of
Mansfield
long
before
the
usual
dinner
-
time
,
and
as
they
approach
the
beloved
place
,
the
heart
of
both
sister
sink
a
little
.
<EOS>
Fanny
begin
to
dread
the
meeting
with
her
aunt
and
Tom
,
under
so
dreadful
a
humiliation
;
and
Susan
to
feel
with
some
anxiety
,
that
all
her
good
manner
,
all
her
lately
acquire
knowledge
of
what
be
practise
here
,
be
on
the
point
of
be
call
into
action
.
<EOS>
vision
of
good
and
ill
breeding
,
of
old
vulgarism
and
new
gentility
,
be
before
her
;
and
she
be
meditate
much
upon
silver
fork
,
napkin
,
and
finger
-
glass
.
<EOS>
Fanny
have
be
everywhere
awake
to
the
difference
of
the
country
since
February
;
but
when
they
enter
the
Park
<EOS>
her
perception
and
her
pleasure
be
of
the
keen
sort
.
<EOS>
It
be
three
month
,
full
three
month
,
since
her
quit
it
,
and
the
change
be
from
winter
to
summer
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
fall
everywhere
on
lawn
and
plantation
of
the
fresh
green
;
and
the
tree
,
though
not
fully
clothe
,
be
in
that
delightful
state
when
farther
beauty
be
know
to
be
at
hand
,
and
when
,
while
much
be
actually
give
to
the
sight
,
more
yet
remain
for
the
imagination
.
<EOS>
Her
enjoyment
,
however
,
be
for
herself
alone
.
<EOS>
Edmund
could
not
share
it
.
<EOS>
She
look
at
him
,
but
he
be
lean
back
,
sink
in
a
deep
gloom
than
ever
,
and
with
eye
close
,
as
if
the
view
of
cheerfulness
oppress
him
,
and
the
lovely
scene
of
home
must
be
shut
out
.
  
<EOS>
It
make
her
melancholy
again
;
and
the
knowledge
of
what
must
be
endure
there
,
invest
even
the
house
,
modern
,
airy
,
and
well
situate
as
it
be
,
with
a
melancholy
aspect
.
  
<EOS>
by
one
of
the
suffer
party
within
they
be
expect
with
such
impatience
as
she
have
never
know
before
.
<EOS>
Fanny
have
scarcely
pass
the
solemn
-
look
servant
,
when
Lady
Bertram
come
from
the
drawing
-
room
to
meet
her
;
come
with
no
indolent
step
;
and
fall
on
her
neck
,
say
,
"
<EOS>
Dear
Fanny
!
<EOS>
now
I
shall
be
comfortable
.
"
    
<EOS>
It
have
be
a
miserable
party
,
each
of
the
three
believe
themselves
most
miserable
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
,
however
,
as
most
attach
to
Maria
,
be
really
the
great
sufferer
.
<EOS>
Maria
be
her
first
favourite
,
the
dear
of
all
;
the
match
have
be
her
own
contriving
,
as
she
have
be
will
not
with
such
pride
of
heart
to
feel
and
say
,
and
this
conclusion
of
it
almost
overpower
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
an
alter
creature
,
quiet
,
stupefy
,
indifferent
to
everything
that
pass
.
<EOS>
the
being
leave
with
her
sister
and
nephew
,
and
all
the
house
under
her
care
,
have
be
an
advantage
entirely
throw
away
;
she
have
be
unable
to
direct
or
dictate
,
or
even
fancy
herself
useful
.
<EOS>
when
really
touch
by
affliction
,
her
active
power
have
be
all
benumb
;
and
neither
Lady
Bertram
nor
Tom
have
receive
from
her
the
small
support
or
attempt
at
support
.
<EOS>
She
have
do
no
more
for
them
than
they
have
do
for
each
other
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
all
solitary
,
helpless
,
and
forlorn
alike
;
and
now
the
arrival
of
the
other
only
establish
her
superiority
in
wretchedness
.
<EOS>
Her
companion
be
relieve
,
but
there
be
no
good
for
_
<EOS>
her
_
.
<EOS>
Edmund
be
almost
as
welcome
to
his
brother
as
Fanny
to
her
aunt
;
but
Mrs.
Norris
,
instead
of
have
comfort
from
either
,
be
but
the
more
irritated
by
the
sight
of
the
person
whom
,
in
the
blindness
of
her
anger
,
she
could
have
charge
as
the
daemon
of
the
piece
.
<EOS>
have
Fanny
accept
Mr.
Crawford
this
could
not
have
happen
.
  
<EOS>
Susan
too
be
a
grievance
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
spirit
to
notice
her
in
more
than
a
few
repulsive
look
,
but
she
feel
her
as
a
spy
,
and
an
intruder
,
and
an
indigent
niece
,
and
everything
most
odious
.
<EOS>
by
her
other
aunt
,
Susan
be
receive
with
quiet
kindness
.
<EOS>
Lady
Bertram
could
not
give
her
much
time
,
or
many
word
,
but
she
feel
her
,
as
Fanny
's
sister
,
to
have
a
claim
at
Mansfield
,
and
be
ready
to
kiss
and
like
her
;
and
Susan
be
more
than
satisfied
,
for
she
come
perfectly
aware
that
nothing
but
ill
-
humour
be
to
be
expect
from
aunt
Norris
;
and
be
so
provide
with
happiness
,
so
strong
in
that
good
of
blessing
,
an
escape
from
many
certain
evil
,
that
she
could
have
stand
against
a
great
deal
more
indifference
than
she
meet
with
from
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
now
leave
a
good
deal
to
herself
,
to
get
acquaint
with
the
house
and
ground
as
she
could
,
and
spend
her
day
very
happily
in
so
do
,
while
those
who
may
otherwise
have
attend
to
her
be
shut
up
,
or
wholly
occupy
each
with
the
person
quite
dependent
on
them
,
at
this
time
,
for
everything
like
comfort
;
Edmund
try
to
bury
his
own
feeling
in
exertion
for
the
relief
of
his
brother
's
,
and
Fanny
devoted
to
her
aunt
Bertram
,
return
to
every
former
office
with
more
than
former
zeal
,
and
think
she
could
never
do
enough
for
one
who
seem
so
much
to
want
her
.
  
<EOS>
to
talk
over
the
dreadful
business
with
Fanny
,
talk
and
lament
,
be
all
Lady
Bertram
's
consolation
.
<EOS>
to
be
listen
to
and
borne
with
,
and
hear
the
voice
of
kindness
and
sympathy
in
return
,
be
everything
that
could
be
do
for
her
.
<EOS>
to
be
otherwise
comfort
be
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
the
case
admit
of
no
comfort
.
<EOS>
Lady
Bertram
do
not
think
deeply
,
but
,
guide
by
Sir
Thomas
,
she
think
justly
on
all
important
point
;
and
she
see
,
therefore
,
in
all
its
enormity
,
what
have
happen
,
and
neither
endeavour
herself
,
nor
require
Fanny
to
advise
her
,
to
think
little
of
guilt
and
infamy
.
  
<EOS>
Her
affection
be
not
acute
,
nor
be
her
mind
tenacious
.
<EOS>
after
a
time
,
Fanny
find
it
not
impossible
to
direct
her
thought
to
other
subject
,
and
revive
some
interest
in
the
usual
occupation
;
but
whenever
Lady
Bertram
_
be
_
fix
on
the
event
,
she
could
see
it
only
in
one
light
,
as
comprehend
the
loss
of
a
daughter
,
and
a
disgrace
never
to
be
wipe
off
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
learn
from
her
all
the
particular
which
have
yet

.
<EOS>
Her
aunt
be
no
very
methodical
narrator
,
but
with
the
help
of
some
letter
to
and
from
Sir
Thomas

and
what
she
already
know
herself
,
and
could
reasonably
combine
,
she

able
to
understand
quite
as
much
as

lady
,
even
in
the
short
time
they
have
be
together
,
have
disagree
;
and
the
bitterness
of
the
elder
against
her
daughter
-
in
-
law
may
perhaps
arise
almost
as
much
from
the
personal
disrespect
with
which
she
have
herself
be
treat
as
from
sensibility
for
her
son
.
  
<EOS>
however
that
may
be
,
she
be
unmanageable
.
<EOS>
but
have
she
be
less
obstinate
,
or
of
less
weight
with
her
son
,
who
be
always
guide
by
the
last
speaker
,
by
the
person
who
could
get
hold
of
and
shut
him
up
<EOS>
,
the
case
would
still
have
be
hopeless
,
for
Mrs.
Rushworth
do
not
appear
again
,
and
there
be
every
reason
to
conclude
her
to
be
conceal
somewhere
with
Mr.
Crawford
,
who
have
quit
his
uncle
's
house
,
as
for
a
journey
,
on
the
very
day
of
her
absent
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
,
however
,
remain
yet
a
little
longer
in
town
,
in
the
hope
of
discover
and
snatch
her
from
farth
vice
,
though
all
be
lose
on
the
side
of
character
.
  
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
His
_
present
state
Fanny
could
hardly
bear
to
think
of
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
one
of
his
child
who
be
not
at
this
time
a
source
of
misery
to
him
.
<EOS>
Tom
's
complaint
have
be
greatly
heighten
by
the
shock
of
his
sister
's
conduct
,
and
his
recovery
so
much
throw
back
by
it
,
that
even
Lady
Bertram
have
be
strike
by
the
difference
,
and
all
her
alarm
be
regularly
send
off
to
her
husband
;
and
Julia
's
elopement
,
the
additional
blow
which
have
meet
him
on
his
arrival
in
London
,
though
its
force
have
be
deaden
at
the
moment
,
must
,
she
know
,
be
sorely
feel
.
<EOS>
She
see
that
it
be
.
<EOS>
His
letter
express
how
much
he
deplore
it
.
<EOS>
under
any
circumstance
it
would
have
be
an
unwelcome
alliance
;
but
to
have
it
so
clandestinely
form
,
and
such
a
period
choose
for
its
completion
,
place
Julia
's
feeling
in
a
most
unfavourable
light
,
and
severely
aggravate
the
folly
of
her
choice
.
<EOS>
He
call
it
a
bad
thing
,
do
in
the
bad
manner
,
and
at
the
bad
time
;
and
though
Julia
be
yet
as
more
pardonable
than
Maria
as
folly
than
vice
,
he
could
not
but
regard
the
step
she
have
take
as
open
the
bad
probability
of
a
conclusion
hereafter
like
her
sister
's
.
<EOS>
such
be
his
opinion
of
the
set
into
which
she
have
throw
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
feel
for
him
most
acutely
.
<EOS>
He
could
have
no
comfort
but
in
Edmund
.
<EOS>
every
other
child
must
be
rack
his
heart
.
<EOS>
His
displeasure
against
herself
she
trust
,
reason
differently
from
Mrs.
Norris
,
would
now
be
do
away
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
should
be
justify
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Crawford
would
have
fully
acquit
her
conduct
in
refuse
him
;
but
this
,
though
most
material
to
herself
,
would
be
poor
consolation
to
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
Her
uncle
's
displeasure
be
terrible
to
her
;
but
what
could
her
justification
or
her
gratitude
and
attachment
do
for
him
?
<EOS>
His
stay
must
be
on
Edmund
alone
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
mistaken
,
however
,
in
supposing
that
Edmund
give
his
father
no
present
pain
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
a
much
less
poignant
nature
than
what
the
other
excited
;
but
Sir
Thomas
be
consider
his
happiness
as
very
deeply
involved
in
the
offence
of
his
sister
and
friend
;
cut
off
by
it
,
as
he
must
be
,
from
the
woman
whom
he
have
be
pursue
with
undoubted
attachment
and
strong
probability
of
success
;
and
who
,
in
everything
but
this
despicable
brother
,
would
have
be
so
eligible
a
connexion
.
<EOS>
He
be
aware
of
what
Edmund
must
be
suffer
on
his
own
behalf
,
in
addition
to
all
the
rest
,
when
they
be
in
town
:
he
have
see
or
conjecture
his
feeling
;
and
,
have
reason
to
think
that
one
interview
with
Miss
Crawford
have
take
place
,
from
which
Edmund
derive
only
increase
distress
,
have
be
as
anxious
on
that
account
as
on
other
to
get
him
out
of
town
,
and
have
engage
him
in
take
Fanny
home
to
her
aunt
,
with
a
view
to
his
relief
and
benefit
,
no
less
than
theirs
.
<EOS>
Fanny
be
not
in
the
secret
of
her
uncle
's
feeling
,
Sir
Thomas
not
in
the
secret
of
Miss
Crawford
's
character
.
<EOS>
have
he
be
privy
to
her
conversation
with
his
son
,
he
would
not
have
wish
her
to
belong
to
him
,
though
her
twenty
thousand
pound
have
be
forty
.
  
<EOS>
that
Edmund
must
be
for
ever
divide
from
Miss
Crawford
do
not
admit
of
a
doubt
with
Fanny
;
and
yet
,
till
she
know
that
he
feel
the
same
,
her
own
conviction
be
insufficient
.
<EOS>
She
think
he
do
,
but
she
want
to
be
assure
of
it
.
<EOS>
if
he
would
now
speak
to
her
with
the
unreserve
which
have
sometimes
be
too
much
for
her
before
,
it
would
be
most
consoling
;
but
_
that
_
<EOS>
she
find
be
not
to
be
.
<EOS>
She
seldom
see
him
:
never
alone
.
<EOS>
He
probably
avoid
be
alone
with
her
.
<EOS>
what
be
to
be
infer
?
<EOS>
that
his
judgment
submit
to
all
his
own
peculiar
and
bitter
share
of
this
family
affliction
,
but
that
it
be
too
keenly
feel
to
be
a
subject
of
the
slight
communication
.
<EOS>
this
must
be
his
state
.
<EOS>
He
yield
,
but
it
be
with
agony
which
do
not
admit
of
speech
.
<EOS>
long
,
long
would
it
be
ere
Miss
Crawford
's
name
pass
his
lip
again
,
or
she
could
hope
for
a
renewal
of
such
confidential
intercourse
as
have
be
.
  
<EOS>
It
_
be
_
long
.
<EOS>
They
reach
Mansfield
on
Thursday
,
and
it
be
not
till
Sunday
evening
that
Edmund
begin
to
talk
to
her
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
sit
with
her
on
Sunday
evening
 
a
wet
Sunday
evening
 
<EOS>
the
very
time
of
all
other
when
,
if
a
friend
be
at
hand
,
the
heart
must
be
open
,
and
everything
tell
;
no
one
else
in
the
room
,
except
his
mother
,
who
,
after
hear
an
affect
sermon
,
have
cry
herself
to
sleep
<EOS>
,
it
be
impossible
not
to
speak
;
and
so
,
with
the
usual
beginning
,
hardly
to
be
trace
as
to
what
come
first
,
and
the
usual
declaration
that
if
she
would
listen
to
him
for
a
few
minute
,
he
should
be
very
brief
,
and
certainly
never
tax
her
kindness
in
the
same
way
again
;
she
nee
not
fear
a
repetition
;
it
would
be
a
subject
prohibit
entirely
:
he
enter
upon
the
luxury
of
relate
circumstance
and
sensation
of
the
first
interest
to
himself
,
to
one
of
whose
affectionate
sympathy
he
be
quite
convinced
.
  
<EOS>
how
Fanny
listen
,
with
what
curiosity
and
concern
,
what
pain
and
<EOS>
what
delight
,
how
the
agitation
of
his
voice
be
watch
,
and
how
carefully
her
own
eye
be
fix
on
any
object
but
himself
,
may
be
imagine
.
<EOS>
the
opening
be
alarming
.
<EOS>
He
have
see
Miss
Crawford
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
invite
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
receive
a
note
from
Lady
Stornaway
to
beg
him
to
call
;
and
regard
it
as
what
be
mean
to
be
the
last
,
last
interview
of
friendship
,
and
invest
her
with
all
the
feeling
of
shame
and
wretchedness
which
Crawford
's
sister
ought
to
have
know
,
he
have
go
to
her
in
such
a
state
of
mind
,
so
soften
,
so
devoted
,
as
make
it
for
a
few
moment
impossible
to
Fanny
's
fear
that
it
should
be
the
last
.
<EOS>
but
as
he
proceed
in
his
story
,
these
fear
be
over
.
<EOS>
She
have
meet
him
,
he
say
,
with
a
serious
 
certainly
a
serious
 
even
an
agitated
air
;
but
before
he
have
be
able
to
speak
one
intelligible
sentence
,
she
have
introduce
the
subject
in
a
manner
which
he
own
have
shock
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
hear
you
be
in
town
,
"
say
she
;
"
I
want
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
let
us
talk
over
this
sad
business
.
<EOS>
what
can
equal
the
folly
of
our
two
relation
?
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
answer
,
but
I
believe
my
look
speak
.
<EOS>
She
feel
reprove
.
<EOS>
sometimes
how
quick
to
feel
!
<EOS>
with
a
graver
look
and
voice
she
then
add
,
"
I
do
not
mean
to
defend
Henry
at
your
sister
's
expense
.
"
<EOS>
so
she
begin
,
but
how
she
go
on
,
Fanny
,
be
not
fit
,
be
hardly
fit
to
be
repeat
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
recall
all
her
word
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
dwell
upon
them
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
Their
substance
be
great
anger
at
the
_
folly
_
of
each
.
<EOS>
She
reprobate
her
brother
's
folly
in
be
draw
on
by
a
woman
whom
he
have
never
care
for
,
to
do
what
must
lose
him
the
woman
he
adore
;
but
still
more
the
folly
of
poor
Maria
,
in
sacrifice
such
a
situation
,
plunge
into
such
difficulty
,
under
the
idea
of
be
really
love
by
a
man
who
have
long
ago
make
his
indifference
clear
.
<EOS>
guess
what
I
must
have
feel
.
<EOS>
to
hear
the
woman
whom
 
no
harsher
name
than
folly
give
!
<EOS>
so
voluntarily
,
so
freely
,
so
coolly
to
canvass
it
!
<EOS>
no
reluctance
,
no
horror
,
no
feminine
,
shall
I
say
,
no
modest
loathing
?
<EOS>
this
be
what
the
world
do
.
<EOS>
for
where
,
Fanny
,
shall
we
find
a
woman
whom
nature
have
so
richly
endow
?
<EOS>
spoilt
,
spoilt
!
"
  
<EOS>
after
a
little
reflection
,
he
go
on
with
a
sort
of
desperate
calmness
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
everything
,
and
then
have
do
for
ever
.
<EOS>
She
see
it
only
as
folly
,
and
that
folly
stamp
only
by
exposure
.
<EOS>
the
want
of
common
discretion
,
of
caution
:
his
go
down
to
Richmond
for
the
whole
time
of
her
be
at
Twickenham
;
her
put
herself
in
the
power
of
a
servant
;
it
be
the
detection
,
in
short
 
<EOS>
oh
,
Fanny
!
<EOS>
it
be
the
detection
,
not
the
offence
,
which
she
reprobate
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
imprudence
which
have
bring
thing
to
extremity
,
and
oblige
her
brother
to
give
up
every
dearer
plan
in
order
to
fly
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
stopt
.
"
<EOS>
and
what
,
"
say
Fanny
(
believe
herself
require
to
speak
)
,
"
what
could
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
nothing
,
nothing
to
be
understand
.
<EOS>
I
be
like
a
man
stunned
.
<EOS>
She
go
on
,
begin
to
talk
of
you
;
yes
,
then
she
begin
to
talk
of
you
,
regret
,
<EOS>
as
well
she
may
,
the
loss
of
such
a

<EOS>
there
she
speak
very
rationally
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
always
do
justice
to
you

"
<EOS>
He
have
throw
away
,
"
say
she
,
"
such
a
woman
as
he
will
never
see
again
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
fix
him
;
she
would
have
make
him
happy
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
Fanny
,
I
be
give
you
,
I
hope
,
more
pleasure
than
pain
by
this
retrospect
of
what
may
have
be
 
but
what
never
can
be
now
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
wish
me
to
be
silent
?
<EOS>
if
you
do
,
give
me
<EOS>
but
a
look
,
a
word
,
and
I
have
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
no
look
or
word
be
give
.
  
<EOS>
"
thank
God
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
all
dispose
to
wonder
,
but
it
seem
to
have
be
the
merciful
appointment
of
Providence
that
the
heart
which
know
no
guile
should
not
suffer
.
<EOS>
She
speak
of
you
with
high
praise
and
warm
affection
;
yet
,
even
here
,
there
be
alloy
,
a
dash
of
evil
;
for
in
the
midst
of
it
she
could
exclaim
,
"
why
would
not
she
have
him
?
<EOS>
It
be
all
her
fault
.
<EOS>
simple
girl
!
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forgive
her
.
<EOS>
have
she
accept
him
as
she
ought
,
they
may
now
have
be
on
the
point
of
marriage
,
and
Henry
would
have
be
too
happy
and
too
busy
to
want
any
other
object
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
take
no
pain
to
be
on
term
with
Mrs.
Rushworth
again
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
all
end
in
a
regular
standing
flirtation
,
in
yearly
meeting
at
Sotherton
and
Everingham
.
"
<EOS>
Could
you
have
believe
it
possible
?
<EOS>
but
the
charm
be
break
.
<EOS>
My
eye
be
open
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
cruel
!
"
say
Fanny
,
"
quite
cruel
.
<EOS>
at
such
a
moment
to
give
way
to
gaiety
,
to
speak
with
lightness
,
and
to
you
!
<EOS>
absolute
cruelty

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cruelty
,
do
you
call
it
?
<EOS>
We
differ
there
.
<EOS>
no
,
hers
be
not
a
cruel
nature
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
consider
her
as
meaning
to
wound
my
feeling
.
<EOS>
the
evil
lie
yet
deep
:
in
her
total
ignorance
,
unsuspiciousness
of
there
be
such
feeling
;
in
a
perversion
of
mind
which
make
it
natural
to
her
to
treat
the
subject
as
she
do
.
<EOS>
She
be
speak
only
as
she
have
be
use
to
hear
other
speak
,
as
she
imagine
everybody
else
would
speak
.
<EOS>
her
be
not
fault
of
temper
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
voluntarily
give
unnecessary
pain
to
any
one
,
and
though
I
may
deceive
myself
,
I
can
not
but
think
that
for
me
,
for
my
feeling
,
she
would
 
her
be
fault
of
principle
,
Fanny
;
of
blunt
delicacy
and
a
corrupted
,
vitiate
mind
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
good
for
me
,
since
it
leave
me
so
little
to
regret
.
<EOS>
not
so
,
however
.
<EOS>
gladly
would
I
submit
to
all
the
increase
pain
of
lose
her

rather
than
have
to

I

she
go
on
to
say
that
what
remain
now
to
be
do
be
to
bring
about
a
marriage
between
them
.
<EOS>
She
speak
of
it
,
Fanny
,
with
a
steady
voice
than
I
can
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
oblige
to
pause
more
than
once
as
he
continue
.
"
<EOS>
"
We
must
persuade
Henry
to
marry
her
,
"
say
she
;
"
and
what
with
honour
,
and
the
certainty
of
have
shut
himself
out
for
ever
from
Fanny
,
I
do
not
despair
of
it
.
<EOS>
Fanny
he
must
give
up
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
even
_
he
_
could
now
hope
to
succeed
with
one
of
her
stamp
,
and
therefore
I
hope
we
may
find
no
insuperable
difficulty
.
<EOS>
My
influence
,
which
be
not
small
shall
all
go
that
way
;
and
when
once
marry
,
and
properly
support
by
her
own
family
,
people
of
respectability
as
they
be
,
she
may
recover
her
footing
in
society
to
a
certain
degree
.
<EOS>
in
some
circle
,
we
know
,
she
would
never
be
admit
,
but
with
good
dinner
,
and
large
party
,
there
will
always
be
those
who
will
be
glad
of
her
acquaintance
;
and
there
be
,
undoubtedly
,
more
liberality
and
candour
on
those
point
than
formerly
.
<EOS>
what
I
advise
be
,
that
your
father
be
quiet
.
<EOS>
do
not
let
him
injure
his
own
cause
by
interference
.
<EOS>
persuade
him
to
let
thing
take
their
course
.
<EOS>
if
by
any
officious
exertion
of
his
,
she
be
induce
to
leave
Henry
's
protection
,
there
will
be
much
less
chance
of
his
marry
her
than
if
she
remain
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
know
how
he
be
likely
to
be
influence
.
<EOS>
let
Sir
Thomas
trust
to
his
honour
and
compassion
,
and
it
may
all
end
well
;
but
if
he
get
his
daughter
away
,
it
will
be
destroy
the
chief
hold
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
after
repeat
this
,
Edmund
be
so
much
affect
that
Fanny
,
watch
him
with
silent
,
but
most
tender
concern
,
be
almost
sorry
that
the
subject
have
be
enter
on
at
all
.
<EOS>
It
be
long
before
he
could
speak
again
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
"
now
,
Fanny
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
shall
soon
have
do
.
<EOS>
I
have
tell
you
the
substance
of
all
that
she
say
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
could
speak
,
I
reply
that
I
have
not
suppose
it
possible
,
come
in
such
a
state
of
mind
into
that
house
as
I
have
do
,
that
anything
could
occur
to
make
me
suffer
more
,
but
that
she
have
be
inflict
deep
wound
in
almost
every
sentence
.
<EOS>
that
though
I
have
,
in
the
course
of
our
acquaintance
,
be
often
sensible
of
some
difference
in
our
opinion
,
on
point
,
too
,
of
some
moment
,
it
have
not
enter
my
imagination
to
conceive
the
difference
could
be
such
as
she
have
now
prove
it
.
<EOS>
that
the
manner
in
which
she
treat
the
dreadful
crime
commit
by
her
brother
and
my
sister
(
with
whom
lie
the
great
seduction
I
pretend
not
to
say
)
,
but
the
manner
in
which
she
speak
of
the
crime
itself
,
give
it
every
reproach
but
the
right
;
consider
its
ill
consequence
only
as
they
be
to
be
brave
or
overbear
by
a
defiance
of
decency
and
impudence
in
wrong
;
and
last
of
all
,
and
above
all
,
recommend
to
us
a
compliance
,
a
compromise
,
an
acquiescence
in
the
continuance
of
the
sin
,
on
the
chance
of
a
marriage
which
,
think
as
I
now
think
of
her
brother
,
should
rather
be
prevent
than
seek
;
all
this
together
most
grievously
convince
me
that
I
have
never
understand
her
before
,
and
that
,
as
far
as
relate
to
mind
,
it
have
be
the
creature
of
my
own
imagination
,
not
Miss
Crawford
,
that
I
have
be
too
apt
to
dwell
on
for
many
month
past
.
<EOS>
that
,
perhaps
,
it
be
good
for
me
;
I
have
less
to
regret
in
sacrifice
a
friendship
,
feeling
,
hope
which
must
,
at
any
rate
,
have
be
tear
from
me
now
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
that
I
must
and
would
confess
that
,
could
I
have
restore
her
to
what
she
have
appear
to
me
before
,
I
would
infinitely
prefer
any
increase
of
the
pain
of
parting
,
for
the
sake
of
carry
with
me
the
right
of
tenderness
and
esteem
.
<EOS>
this
be
what
I
say
,
the
purport
of
it
;
but
,
as
you
may
imagine
,
not
speak
so
collectedly
or
methodically
as
I
have
repeat
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
She
be
astonish
,
exceedingly
astonish
 
more
than
astonished
.
<EOS>
I
see
her
change
countenance
.
<EOS>
She
turn
extremely
red
.
<EOS>
I
imagine
I
see
a
mixture
of
many
feeling
:
<EOS>
a
great
,
though
short
struggle
;
half
a
wish
of
yield
to
truth
,
half
a
sense
of
shame
,
but
habit
,
habit
carry
it
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
laugh
if
she
could
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
sort
of
laugh
,
as
she
answer
,
"
a
pretty
good
lecture
,
upon
my
word
.
<EOS>
be
it
part
of
your
last
sermon
?
<EOS>
at
this
rate
you
will
soon
reform
everybody
at
Mansfield
and
Thornton
Lacey
;
and
when
I
hear
of
you
next
,
it
may
be
as
a
celebrated
preacher
in
some
great
society
of
Methodists
,
or
as
a
missionary
into
foreign
part
.
"
<EOS>
She
try
to
speak
carelessly
,
but
she
be
not
so
careless
as
she
want
to
appear
.
<EOS>
I
only
say
in
reply
,
that
from
my
heart
I
wish
her
well
,
and
earnestly
hope
that
she
may
soon
learn
to
think
more
justly
,
and
not
owe
the
most
valuable
knowledge
we
could
any
of
us
acquire
,
the
knowledge
of
ourselves
and
of
our
duty
,
to
the
lesson
of
affliction
,
and
immediately
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
I
have
go
a
few
step
,
Fanny
,
when
I
hear
the
door
open
behind
me
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bertram
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
I
look
back
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bertram
,
"
say
she
,
with
a
smile
;
but
it
be
a
smile
ill
-
suit
to
the
conversation
that
have
pass
,
a
saucy
playful
smile
,
seem
to
invite
in
order
to
subdue
me
;
at
least
it
appear
so
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
resist
;
it
be
the
impulse
of
the
moment
to
resist
,
and
still
walk
on
.
<EOS>
I
have
since
,
sometimes
,
for
a
moment
,
regret
that
I
do
not
go
back
,
but
I
know
I
be
right
,
and
such
have
be
the
end
of
our
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
and
what
an
acquaintance
have
it
be
!
<EOS>
how
have
I
be
deceive
!
<EOS>
equally
in
brother
and
sister
deceive
!
<EOS>
I
thank
you
for
your
patience
,
Fanny
.
<EOS>
this
have
be
the
great
relief
,
and
now
we
will
have
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
such
be
Fanny
's
dependence
on
his
word
,
<EOS>
that
for
five
minute
she
think
they
_
have
_
do
.
<EOS>
then
,
however
,
it
all
come
on
again
,
or
something
very
like
it
,
and
nothing
less
than
Lady
Bertram
's
rouse
thoroughly
up
could
really
close
such
a
conversation
.
<EOS>
till
that
happen
,
they
continue
to
talk
of
Miss
Crawford
alone
,
and
how
she
have
attach
him
,
and
how
delightful
nature
have
make
her
,
and
how
excellent
she
would
have
be
,
have
she
fall
into
good
hand
earlier
.
<EOS>
Fanny
,
now
at
liberty
to
speak
openly
,
feel
more
than
justified
in
add
to
his
knowledge
of
her
real
character
,
by
some
hint
of
what
share
his
brother
's
state
of
health
may
be
suppose
to
have
in
her
wish
for
a
complete
reconciliation
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
an
agreeable
intimation
.
<EOS>
Nature
resist
it
for
a
while
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
a
vast
deal
pleasanter
to
have
have
her
more
disintereste
in
her
attachment
;
but
his
vanity
be
not
of
a
strength
to
fight
long
against
reason
.
<EOS>
He
submit
to
believe
that
Tom
's
illness
have
influence
her
,
only
reserve
for
himself
this
consoling
thought
,
that
consider
the
many
counteraction
of
oppose
habit
,
she
have
certainly
be
_
more
_
attach
to
him
than
could
have
be
expect
,
and
for
his
sake
be
more
near
do
right
.
<EOS>
Fanny
think
exactly
the
same
;
and
they
be
also
quite
agree
in
their
opinion
of
the
lasting
effect
,
the
indelible
impression
,
which
such
a
disappointment
must
make
on
his
mind
.
<EOS>
Time
would
undoubtedly
abate
somewhat
of
his
suffering
,
but
still
it
be
a
sort
of
thing
which
he
never
could
get
entirely
the
well
of
;
and
as
to
his
ever
meeting
with
any
other
woman
who
could
 
it
be
too
impossible
to
be
name
but
with
indignation
.
<EOS>
Fanny
's
friendship
be
all
that
he
have
to
cling
to
.
    
<EOS>
let
other
pen
dwell
on
guilt
and
misery
.
<EOS>
I
quit
such
odious
subject
as
soon
as
I
can
,
impatient
to
restore
everybody
,
not
greatly
in
fault
themselves
,
to
tolerable
comfort
,
and
to
have
do
with
all
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
My
Fanny
,
indeed
,
at
this
very
time
,
I
have
the
satisfaction
of
know
,
must
have
be
happy
in
spite
of
everything
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
be
a
happy
creature
in
spite
of
all
that
she
feel
,
or
think
she
feel
,
for
the
distress
of
those
around
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
source
of
delight
that
must
force
their
way
.
<EOS>
She
be
return
to
Mansfield
Park
<EOS>
,
she
be
useful
,
she
be
beloved
;
she
be
safe
from
Mr.
Crawford
;
and
when
Sir
Thomas
come
back
she
have
every
proof
that
could
be
give
in
his
then
melancholy
state
of
spirit
,
of
his
perfect
approbation
and
increase
regard
;
and
happy
as
all
this
must
make
her
,
she
would
still
have
be
happy
without
any
of
it
,
for
Edmund
be
no
longer
the
dupe
of
Miss
Crawford
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
Edmund
be
very
far
from
happy
himself
.
<EOS>
He
be
suffer
from
disappointment
and
regret
,
grieve
over
what
be
,
and
wish
for
what
could
never
be
.
<EOS>
She
know
it
be
so
,
and
be
sorry
;
but
it
be
with
a
sorrow
so
found
on
satisfaction
,
so
tend
to
ease
,
and
so
much
in
harmony
with
every
dear
sensation
,
that
there
be
few
who
may
not
have
be
glad
to
exchange
their
great
gaiety
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
,
poor
Sir
Thomas
,
a
parent
,
and
conscious
of
error
in
his
own
conduct
as
a
parent
,
be
the
long
to
suffer
.
<EOS>
He
feel
that
he
ought
not
to
have
allow
the
marriage
;
that
his
daughter
's
sentiment
have
be
sufficiently
know
to
him
to
render
him
culpable
in
authorise
it
;
that
in
so
do
he
have
sacrifice
the
right
to
the
expedient
,
and
be
govern
by
motive
of
selfishness
and
worldly
wisdom
.
<EOS>
these
be
reflection
that
require
some
time
to
soften
;
but
time
will
do
almost
everything
;
and
though
little
comfort
arise
on
Mrs.
Rushworth
's
side
for
the
misery
she
have
occasion
,
comfort
be
to
be
find
great
than
he
have
suppose
in
his
other
child
.
<EOS>
Julia
's
match
become
a
less
desperate
business
than
he
have
consider
it
at
first
.
<EOS>
She
be
humble
,
and
wish
to
be
forgive
;
and
Mr.
Yates
,
desirous
of
be
really
receive
into
the
family
,
be
dispose
to
look
up
to
him
and
be
guide
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
very
solid
;
but
there
be
a
hope
of
his
become
less
trifling
,
of
his
being
at
least
tolerably
domestic
and
quiet
;
and
at
any
rate
,
there
be
comfort
in
find
his
estate
rather
more
,
and
his
debt
much
less
,
than
he
have
fear
,
and
in
be
consult
and
treat
as
the
friend
best
worth
attend
to
.
<EOS>
there
be
comfort
also
in
Tom
,
who
gradually
regain
his
health
,
without
regain
the
thoughtlessness
and
selfishness
of
his
previous
habit
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
well
for
ever
for
his
illness
.
<EOS>
He
have
suffer
,
and
he
have
learn
to
think
:
two
advantage
that
he
have
never
know
before
;
and
the
self
-
reproach
arise
from
the
deplorable
event
in
Wimpole
Street
,
to
which
he
feel
himself
accessory
by
all
the
dangerous
intimacy
of
his
unjustifiable
theatre
,
make
an
impression
on
his
mind
which
,
at
the
age
of
six
-
and
-
twenty
,
with
no
want
of
sense
or
good
companion
,
be
durable
in
its
happy
effect
.
<EOS>
He
become
what
he
ought
to
be
:
useful
to
his
father
,
steady
and
quiet
,
and
not
live
merely
for
himself
.
  
<EOS>
here
be
comfort
indeed
!
<EOS>
and
quite
as
soon
as
Sir
Thomas
could
place
dependence
on
such
source
of
good
,
Edmund
be
contribute
to
his
father
's
ease
by
improvement
in
the
only
point
in
which
he
have
give
him
pain
before
 
improvement
in
his
spirit
.
<EOS>
after
wander
about
and
sit
under
tree
with
Fanny
all
the
summer
evening
,
he
have
so
well
talk
his
mind
into
submission
as
to
be
very
tolerably
cheerful
again
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
the
circumstance
and
the
hope
which
gradually
bring
their
alleviation
to
Sir
Thomas
,
deaden
his
sense
of
what
be
lose
,
and
in
part
reconcile
him
to
himself
;
though
the
anguish
arise
from
the
conviction
of
his
own
error
in
the
education
of
his
daughter
be
never
to
be
entirely
do
away
.
  
<EOS>
too
late
he
become
aware
<EOS>
how
unfavourable
to
the
character
of
any
young
people
must
be
the
totally
opposite
treatment
which
Maria
and
Julia
have
be
always
experience
at
home
,
where
the
excessive
indulgence
and
flattery
of
their
aunt
have
be
continually
contrast
with
his
own
severity
.
<EOS>
He
see
how
ill
he
have
judge
,
in
expect
to
counteract
what
be
wrong
in
Mrs.
Norris
by
its
reverse
in
himself
;
clearly
see
that
he
have
but
increase
the
evil
by
teach
them
to
repress
their
spirit
in
his
presence
so
as
to
make
their
real
disposition
unknown
to
him
,
and
send
them
for
all
their
indulgence
to
a
person
who
have
be
able
to
attach
them
only
by
the
blindness
of
her
affection
,
and
the
excess
of
her
praise
.
  
<EOS>
here
have
be
grievous
mismanagement
;
but
,
bad
as
it
be
,
he
gradually
grow
to
feel
that
it
have
not
be
the
most
direful
mistake
in
his
plan
of
education
.
<EOS>
something
must
have
be
want
_
within
_
,
or
time
would
have
wear
away
much
of
its
ill
effect
.
<EOS>
He
fear
that

the

His

He

<EOS>
where
she
could

become
a

momentous

<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
,
whose
attachment
seem
to
augment
with
the
demerit
of
her
niece
,
would
have
have
her
receive
at
home
and
countenance
by
them
all
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
would
not
hear
of
it
;
and
Mrs.
Norris
's
anger
against
Fanny
be
so
much
the
great
,
from
consider
_
her

residence
there
as
the
motive
.
<EOS>
She
persist
in
place
his
scruple

though
Sir

her
that

have
there
be
no

to

endanger
by
the
society
or
hurt
by
the
character
of
Mrs.

<EOS>
,
he
would
never
have
offer
so
great
an
insult
to
the
neighbourhood
as
to
expect
it
to
notice
her
.
<EOS>
as
a
daughter
,
he
hope
a
penitent
one
,
she
should
be
protect
by
him
,
and
secure
in
every
comfort
,
and
support
by
every
encouragement
to
do
right
,
which
their
relative
situation
admit
;
but
farther
than
_
that
_
he
could
not
go
.
<EOS>
Maria
have
destroy
her
own
character
,
and
he
would
not

by
a
vain
attempt
to
restore
what
never
could
be
restore
,
by
afford
his
sanction
to
vice
,
or
in

its
disgrace

be
anywise
accessory

such
misery
in
another
man

<EOS>
It
end
in
Mrs.
Norris
be
resolve
to
quit
Mansfield
and
devote
herself
to
her
unfortunate
Maria

and
in
an
establishment

for
them
in
another
country

remote

where

shut
up
together
with
little
society

on
one
side
no

on

it

their
mutual
punishment

<EOS>
Mrs.
Norris
's
removal
from
Mansfield
be
the
great
supplementary
comfort
of
Sir
Thomas
's
life
.
<EOS>
His
opinion
of
her
have
be
sink
from
the
day
of
his
return
from
Antigua
:
in
every
transaction
together
from
that
period
,
in
their
daily
intercourse
,
in
business
,
or
in
chat
,
she
have
be
regularly
lose
ground
in
his
esteem
,
and
convince
him
that
either
time
have
do
her
much
disservice
,
or
that
he
have
considerably
over
-
rate
her
sense
,
and
wonderfully
borne
with
her
manner
before
.
<EOS>
He
have
feel
her
as
an
hourly
evil
,
which
be
so
much
the
bad
,
as
there
seem
no
chance
of
its
ceasing
but
with
life
;
she
seem
a
part
of
himself
that
must
be
bear
for
ever

<EOS>
to
be
relieve
from
her
,
therefore
,
be
so
great
a
felicity
that

have
she
not

bitter
remembrance
behind
her
<EOS>
,
there
may
have
be
danger
of
his
learn
almost
to
approve
the
evil
which
produce
such
a
good

<EOS>
She
be
regret
by
no
one
at
Mansfield
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
be
able
to
attach
even
those
she
love
best
;
and
since
Mrs.
Rushworth
's
elopement
,
her
temper
have
be
in
a
state
of
such
irritation
as
to
make
her
everywhere
torment
.
<EOS>
not
even
Fanny

tear
for
aunt
Norris
,
not
even
when
she
be
go
for

<EOS>
that
Julia
escape
better
than
Maria
<EOS>
be
owe
,
in
some
measure
,
to
a
favourable
difference
of
disposition
and
circumstance

but
in
a
great
to
her
have
be
less
the
darling
of
that
very
aunt
,
less
flattered
and
less
spoilt
.
<EOS>
Her
beauty
and
acquirement
have
hold
but
a
second
place
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
always
use
to
think
herself
a
little
inferior
to
Maria
.
<EOS>
Her
temper
be
naturally
the
easy
of
the
two
;
her
feeling
,
though
quick
,
be
more
controllable
,
and
education
have
not
give
her
so
very
hurtful
a
degree
of
self

consequence
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
submit
the
good
to
the
disappointment
in
Henry
Crawford
.
<EOS>
after
the
first
bitterness
of
the
conviction
of
be
slight
be
over
,
she
have
be
tolerably
soon
in
a
fair
way
of
not
think
of
him
again
;
and
when
the
acquaintance
be
renew
in
town
,
and
Mr.
Rushworth
's
house
become
Crawford
's
object
,
she
have
have
the
merit
of
withdraw
herself
from
it
,
and
of
chuse
that
time
to
pay
a
visit
to
her
other
friend
,
in
order
to
secure
herself
from
be
again
too
much
attract

<EOS>
this
have
be
her
motive
in
go
to
her
cousin
's
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Yates
's
convenience
have
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
allow
his
attention
some
time
,
but
with
very
little
idea
of
ever
accept
him
;
and
have
not
her
sister
's
conduct
burst
forth
as
it
do
,
and
her
increased
dread
of
her
father
and
of
home
,
on
that
event
,
imagine
its
certain
consequence
to
herself
would
be
great
severity
and
restraint
,
make
her
hastily
resolve
on
avoid
such
immediate
horror
at
all
risk
<EOS>
,
it
be
probable
that
Mr.
Yates
would
never
have
succeed
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
elope
with
any
bad
feeling
than
those
of
selfish
alarm
.
<EOS>
It
have
appear
to
her
the
only
thing
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
Maria

induce
Julia

folly

<EOS>
Henry

ruin
by
early
independence
and
bad
domestic
example
,
indulge
in
the
freak
of
a
cold

blooded
vanity
a
little
too
long
.
<EOS>
once
it
have
,
by
an
opening
undesigned
and
unmerited
,
lead
him
into
the
way
of
happiness
.
<EOS>
Could
he
have
be
satisfied
with
the
conquest
of
one
amiable
woman
's
affection
,
could
he
have
find
sufficient
exultation
in
overcome
the
reluctance
,
in
work
himself
into
the
esteem
and
tenderness
of
Fanny
Price
,
there
would
have
be
every
probability
of
success
and
felicity
for
him
.
<EOS>
His
affection
have
already
do
something
.
<EOS>
Her
influence
over
him
have
already
give
him
some
influence
over
her
.
<EOS>
Would
he
have
deserve
more
,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
more
would
have
be
obtain
,
especially
when
that
marriage
have
take
place
,
which
would
have
give
him
the
assistance
of
her
conscience
in
subdue
her
first
inclination
,
and
bring
them
very
often
together
.
<EOS>
Would
he
have
persevere
,
and
uprightly
,
Fanny
must
have
be
his
reward
,
and
a
reward
very
voluntarily
bestow
,
within
a
reasonable
period
from
Edmund
's
marry
Mary

<EOS>
have
he
do
as
he

down
to
Everingham
after
his
return
from
Portsmouth

he
may

be
decide
his
own
happy
destiny

<EOS>
but
he
be
press
to
stay
for
Mrs.
Fraser
's
party
;
his
staying
be
make
of
flattering
consequence
,
and
he
be
to
meet
Mrs.
Rushworth
there
.
<EOS>
curiosity
and
vanity
be
both
engage
,
and
the
temptation
of
immediate
pleasure
be
too
strong
for
a
mind
unused
to
make
any
sacrifice
to
right
<EOS>
:
he
resolve
to
defer
his
Norfolk
journey
,
resolve
that
writing
should
answer
the
purpose
of
it
,
or
that
its
purpose
be
unimportant
,
and
staid
.
<EOS>
He
see
Mrs.
Rushworth
,
be
receive
by
her
with
a
coldness
which
ought
to
have
be
repulsive
,
and
have
establish
apparent
indifference
between
them
for
ever
;
but
he
be
mortify
,
he
could
not
bear
to
be
throw
off
by
the
woman
whose
smile
have
be
so
wholly
at
his
command
:
he
must
exert
himself
to
subdue
so
proud
a
display
of
resentment
;
it
be
anger
on
Fanny
's
account
;
he
must
get
the
well
of
it
,
and
make
Mrs.
Rushworth
Maria
Bertram
again
in
her
treatment
of
himself
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
spirit
he
begin
the
attack
,
and
by
animate
perseverance
have
soon
re
-
establish
the
sort
of
familiar
intercourse
,
of
gallantry
,
of
flirtation
,
which
bound
his
view
;
but
in
triumph
over
the
discretion
which
,
though
begin
in
anger
,
may
have
save
them
both
,
he
have
put
himself
in
the
power
of
feeling
on
her
side
more
strong
than
he
have
suppose
.
<EOS>
She
love
him
;
there
be
no
withdraw
attention
avowedly
dear
to
her

<EOS>
He
be
entangle
by
his
own
vanity
,
with
as
little
excuse
of
love
as
possible
,
and
without
the
small
inconstancy
of
mind
towards
her
cousin

<EOS>
to
keep
Fanny
and
the
Bertrams
from
a

<EOS>
Secrecy
could
not
have
be
more
desirable
for
Mrs.
Rushworth

credit
than
he
feel
it
for
his

<EOS>
when
he
return
from
Richmond

he
would
have
be
glad
to
see
Mrs.
Rushworth
no
more

<EOS>
all
that
follow
be
the
result
of
her
imprudence
;
and
he
go
off
with
her
at
last
,
because
he
could
not
help
it
,
regret
Fanny
even
at
the
moment

but
regret
her
infinitely
more
when
all
the
bustle
of
the
intrigue
be
over

and
a
very
few
month
have
teach
him
,
by
the
force

contrast

to
place
a
yet
high
value
on
the
sweetness
of
her
temper

the
purity

her
mind

the
excellence
of
her
principle

punishment

the
public
punishment

disgrace

should
in
a
just
measure
attend

<EOS>
his

of
the
offence
be
,
we

not
one
of

barrier
which
society
give
to
virtue
.
<EOS>
in
this
world
the
penalty
be
less
equal
than
could
be
wish
;
but
without
presume
to
look
forward
to
a
juster
appointment
hereafter
,
we
may
fairly
consider
a
man
of
sense
,
like
Henry
Crawford
,
to
be
provide
for
himself
no
small
portion
of
vexation
and
regret
:
vexation
that
must
rise
sometimes
to
self
-
reproach
,
and
regret
to
wretchedness
,
in
have
so
requite
hospitality
,
so
injure
family
peace
,
so
forfeit
his
good
,
most
estimable
,
and
endear
acquaintance
,
and
so
lose
the
woman
whom
he
have
rationally
as
well
as
passionately
love

<EOS>
after
what
have
pass
to
wound
and
alienate
the
two
family
,
the
continuance
of
the
Bertrams
and
Grants
in
such
close
neighbourhood
would
have
be
most
distressing
;
but
the
absence
of
the
latter
,
for
some
month
purposely
lengthen
,
end
very
fortunately
in
the
necessity
,
or
at

the
practicability

of
a
permanent
removal
.
<EOS>
Dr.

,
through
an
interest
on
which
he

almost
cease

succeed
to
a
stall
in
Westminster

which

as

an
occasion
for

Mansfield

an
excuse

residence
in
London

an
increase
of

to
answer
the
expense

highly
acceptable

those

<EOS>
Mrs.
Grant
,
with
a
temper
to
love
and
be
love
,
must
have
go
with
some
regret
from
the
scene
and
people
she
have
be
use
to

the

happiness
of

in
any

secure
her
a
great
deal
to
enjoy

and
she
have
again
a
home

Mary

Mary
have
have
enough
of
her

,
enough
of
vanity

ambition
,
love
,
and
disappointment
in
the
course
of
the
last
half

be

and
her
20,000
,
any
one
who
could
satisfy
the
well
taste
she
have
acquire
at
Mansfield
,
whose
character
and
manner
could
authorise
a
hope
of
the
domestic
happiness
she
have
there
learn
to
estimate
,
or
put
Edmund
Bertram
sufficiently
out
of
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
Edmund
have
greatly
the
advantage
of
her
in
this
respect
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
to
wait
and
wish
with
vacant
affection
for
an
object
worthy
to
succeed
her
in
them
.
<EOS>
scarcely
have
he
do
regret
Mary
Crawford
,
and
observe
to
Fanny
how
impossible
it
be
that
he
should
ever
meet
with
such
another
woman
,
before
it
begin
to
strike
him
whether
a
very
different
kind
of
woman
may
not
do
just
as
well
,
or
a
great
deal
better
:
whether
Fanny
herself
be
not
grow
as
dear
,
as
important
to
him
in
all
her
smile
and
all
her
way
,
as
Mary
Crawford
have
ever
be
;
and
whether
it
may
not
be
a
possible
,
an
hopeful
undertaking
to
persuade
her
that
her
warm
and
sisterly
regard
for
him
would
be
foundation
enough
for
wed
love
.
  
<EOS>
I
purposely
abstain
from
date
on
this
occasion
,
that
every
one
may
be
at
liberty
to
fix
their
own
,
aware
that
the
cure
of
unconquerable
passion
,
and
the
transfer
of
unchanging
attachment
,
must
vary
much
as
to
time
in
different
people
.
<EOS>
I
only
entreat
everybody
to
believe
that
exactly
at
the
time
when
it
be
quite
natural
that
it
should
be
so
,
and
not
a
week
earlier
,
Edmund
do
cease
to
care
about
Miss
Crawford
,
and
become
as
anxious
to
marry
Fanny
as
Fanny
herself
could
desire
.
  
<EOS>
with
such
a
regard
for
her
,
indeed
,
as
his
have
long
be
,
a
regard
found
on
the
most
endearing
claim
of
innocence
and
helplessness
,
and
complete
by
every
recommendation
of
grow
worth
,
what
could
be
more
natural
than
the
change
?
<EOS>
loving
,
guide
,
protect
her
,
as
he
have
be
do
ever
since
her
be
ten
year
old
<EOS>
,
her
mind
in
so
great
a
degree
form
by
his
care
,
and
her
comfort
depend
on
his
kindness
,
an
object
to
him
of
such
close
and
peculiar
interest
,
dearer
by
all
his
own
importance
with
her
than
any
one
else
at
Mansfield
,
what
be
there
now
to
add
,
but
that
he
should
learn
to
prefer
soft
light
eye
to
sparkle
dark
one
.
<EOS>
and
be
always
with
her
,
and
always
talk
confidentially
,
and
his
feeling
exactly
in
that
favourable
state
which
a
recent
disappointment
give
,
those
soft
light
eye
could
not
be
very
long
in
obtain
the
pre
-
eminence
.
  
<EOS>
have
once
set
out
,
and
feel
that
he
have
do
so
on
this
road
to
happiness
,
there
be
nothing
on
the
side
of
prudence
to
stop
him
or
make
his
progress
slow
;
no
doubt
of
her
deserving
,
no
fear
of
opposition
of
taste
,
no
need
of
draw
new
hope
of
happiness
from
dissimilarity
of
temper
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
,
disposition
,
opinion
,
and
habit
want
no
half
-
concealment
,
no
self
-
deception
on
the
present
,
no
reliance
on
future
improvement
.
<EOS>
even
in
the
midst
of
his
late
infatuation
,
he
have
acknowledge
Fanny
's
mental
superiority
.
<EOS>
what
must
be
his
sense
of
it
now
,
therefore
?
<EOS>
She
be
of
course
only
too
good
for
him
;
but
as
nobody
mind
have
what
be
too
good
for
them
,
he
be
very
steadily
earnest
in
the
pursuit
of
the
blessing
,
and
it
be
not
possible
that
encouragement
from
her
should
be
long
want
.
<EOS>
timid
,
anxious
,
doubt
as
she
be
,
it
be
still
impossible
that
such
tenderness
as
her
should
not
,
at
time
,
hold
out
the
strong
hope
of
success
,
though
it
remain
for
a
later
period
to
tell
him
the
whole
delightful
and
astonishing
truth
.
<EOS>
His
happiness
in
know
himself
to
have
be
so
long
the
beloved
of
such
a
heart
,
must
have
be
great
enough
to
warrant
any
strength
of
language
in
which
he
could
clothe
it
to
her
or
to
himself
;
it
must
have
be
a
delightful
happiness
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
happiness
elsewhere
which
no
description
can
reach
.
<EOS>
let
no
one
presume
to
give
the
feeling
of
a
young
woman
on
receive
the
assurance
of
that
affection
of
which
she
have
scarcely
allow
herself
to
entertain
a
hope
.
  
<EOS>
Their
own
inclination
ascertain
,
there
be
no
difficulty
behind
,
no
drawback
of
poverty
or
parent
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
match
which
Sir
Thomas
's
wish
have
even
forestall
.
<EOS>
sick
of
ambitious
and
mercenary
connexion
,
prize
more
and
more
the
sterling
good
of
principle
and
temper
,
and
chiefly
anxious
to
bind
by
the
strong
security
all
that
remain
to
him
of
domestic
felicity
,
he
have
ponder
with
genuine
satisfaction
on
the
more
than
possibility
of
the
two
young
friend
find
their
natural
consolation
in
each
other
for
all
that
have
occur
of
disappointment
to
either
;
and
the
joyful
consent
which
meet
Edmund
's
application
,
the
high
sense
of
have
realise
a
great
acquisition
in
the
promise
of
Fanny
for
a
daughter
,
form
just
such
a
contrast
with
his
early
opinion
on
the
subject
when
the
poor
little
girl
be
coming
have
be
first
agitate
,
as
time
be
for
ever
produce
between
the
plan
and
decision
of
mortal
,
for
their
own
instruction
,
and
their
neighbour
'
entertainment
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
be
indeed
the
daughter
that
he
want
.
<EOS>
His
charitable
kindness
have
be
rear
a
prime
comfort
for
himself
.
<EOS>
His
liberality
have
a
rich
repayment
,
and
the
general
goodness
of
his
intention
by
her
deserve
it
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
make
her
childhood
happy
;
but
it
have
be
an
error
of
judgment
only
which
have
give
him
the
appearance
of
harshness
,
and
deprive
him
of
her
early
love
;
and
now
,
on
really
know
each
other
,
their
mutual
attachment
become
very
strong
.
<EOS>
after
settle
her
at
Thornton
Lacey
with
every
kind
attention
to
her
comfort
,
the
object
of
almost
every
day
be
to
see
her
there
,
or
to
get
her
away
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
selfishly
dear
as
she
have
long
be
to
Lady
Bertram
,
she
could
not
be
part
with
willingly
by
_
her
_
.
<EOS>
no
happiness
of
son
or
niece
could
make
her
wish
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
possible
to
part
with
her
,
because
Susan
remain
to
supply
her
place
.
<EOS>
Susan
become
the
stationary
niece
,
delighted
to
be
so
;
and
equally
well
adapt
for
it
by
a
readiness
of
mind
,
and
an
inclination
for
usefulness
,
as
Fanny
have
be
by
sweetness
of
temper
,
and
strong
feeling
of
gratitude
.
<EOS>
Susan
could
never
be
spare
.
<EOS>
first
as
a
comfort
to
Fanny
,
then
as
an
auxiliary
,
and
last
as
her
substitute
,
she
be
establish
at
Mansfield
,
with
every
appearance
of
equal
permanency
.
<EOS>
Her
more
fearless
disposition
and
happy
nerve
make
everything
easy
to
her
there
.
<EOS>
with
quickness
in
understand
the
temper
of
those
she
have
to
deal
with
,
and
no
natural
timidity
to
restrain
any
consequent
wish
,
she
be
soon
welcome
and
useful
to
all
;
and
after
Fanny
's
removal
succeed
so
naturally
to
her
influence
over
the
hourly
comfort
of
her
aunt
,
as
gradually
to
become
,
perhaps
,
the
most
beloved
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
in
_
her
_
usefulness
,
in
Fanny
's
excellence
,
in
William
's
continued
good
conduct
and
rise
fame
,
and
in
the
general
well
-
doing
and
success
of
the
other
member
of
the
family
,
all
assist
to
advance
each
other
,
and
do
credit
to
his
countenance
and
aid
,
Sir
Thomas
see
repeat
,
and
for
ever
repeat
,
reason
to
rejoice
in
what
he
have
do
for
them
all
,
and
acknowledge
the
advantage
of
early
hardship
and
discipline
,
and
the
consciousness
of
be
bear
to
struggle
and
endure
.
  
<EOS>
with
so
much
true
merit
and
true
love
,
and
no
want
of
fortune
and
friend
,
the
happiness
of
the
marry
cousin
must
appear
as
secure
as
earthly
happiness
can
be
.
<EOS>
equally
form
for
domestic
life
,
and
attach
to
country
pleasure
,
their
home
be
the
home
of
affection
and
comfort
;
and
to
complete
the
picture
of
good
,
the
acquisition
of
Mansfield
living
,
by
the
death
of
Dr.
Grant
,
occur
just
after
they
have
be
marry
long
enough
to
begin
to
want
an
increase
of
income
,
and
feel
their
distance
from
the
paternal
abode
an
inconvenience
.
  
<EOS>
on
that
event
they
remove
to
Mansfield
;
and
the
Parsonage
there
,
which
,
under
each
of
its
two
former
owner
,
Fanny
have
never
be
able
to
approach
but
with
some
painful
sensation
of
restraint
or
alarm
,
soon
grow
as
dear
to
her
heart
,
and
as
thoroughly
perfect
in
her
eye
,
as
everything
else
within
the
view
and
patronage
of
Mansfield
Park
have
long
be
.
