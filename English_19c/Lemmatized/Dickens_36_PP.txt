He
be
about
the
middle
height

but
the
thinness
of
his
body

and
the
length
of
his
leg

give
him
the
appearance
of
be
much
tall
.

the

<EOS>
It

His

black
hair
escape
in
negligent

bare
wrist
may

between

<EOS>
His

be
thin
and
haggard

an
indescribable
air

fall
from
his

I
take
too
much
wine
after
dinner

have
a
very
vague
recollection
of

about
the
street

smoke
a
cigar
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
I
be
very
drunk

I
must
have
change
my

go
somewhere

insult
somebody

I
have
no
doubt

this

the
terrible
consequence

Mr

his
step
in

room

with
the
gloomy
and
dreadful
resolve
of
accept
the
challenge
of
the
warlike
Doctor
Slammer
,
and
abide
by
the
bad
consequence
that
may
ensue
.
   
<EOS>
to
this
determination
Mr
Winkle
be
urge
by
a
variety
of
consideration
,
the
first
of
which
be
his
reputation
with
the
club
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
always
be
look
up
to
as
a
high
authority
on
all
matter
of
amusement
and
dexterity

whether
offensive
,
defensive
,
or
inoffensive
;
and
if
,
on
this
very
first
occasion
of
be
put
to
the
test
,
he
shrink
back
from
the
trial
,
beneath
his
leader
's
eye
,
his
name
and
standing
be
lose
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
he
remember
to
have
hear
it
frequently
surmise
by
the
uninitiate
in
such
matter
that
by
an
understand
arrangement
between
the
second
,
the
pistol
be
seldom
load
with
ball
;
and
,
furthermore
,
he
reflect
that
if
he
apply
to
Mr
Snodgrass
to
act
as
his
second
,
and
depict
the
danger
in
glow
term
,
that
gentleman
may
possibly
communicate
the
intelligence
to
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
would
certainly
lose
no
time
in
transmit
it
to
the
local
authority
,
and
thus
prevent
the
killing
or
maiming
of
his
follower

be
his
thought

him
at

little
distance

<EOS>
the
evening
grow
more
dull

and

melancholy
wind
sound
through
the
desert
field

We

Mr

<EOS>
the
offer

from
considerable
embarrassment

be
rather
vague
and
undefined
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
may
place
our
man

then
,
I
think
,
"
observe
the
officer
,
with
as
much
indifference
as
if
the
principal

the
second
player

<EOS>
"
I
think
we
may

reply
Mr
Snodgrass

who
would
have
assent
to
any
proposition

because
he
know
nothing
about

<EOS>
the
officer
cross
to
Doctor

Mr

up

It

It
occur
to
Mr

this
advice

invariably
give
to
the
small
boy
in
a
street
fight

namely
,
"
go
in

an
admirable
thing

how
to
do
it

He

off

in
silence

Mr

It
be
conjecture

"

Chapter
3
.
<EOS>
a
new
acquaintance
---
the
stroller
's
tale
---
a
disagreeable
interruption
,
and
an
unpleasant
encounter
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
have
feel
some
apprehension
in
consequence
of
the
unusual
absence
of
his
two
friend
,
which
their
mysterious
behaviour
during
the
whole
morning
have
by
no
mean
tend
to
diminish
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
,
therefore
,
with
more
than
ordinary
pleasure
that
he
rise
to
greet
them
when
they
again
enter
;
and
with
more
than
ordinary
interest
that
he
inquire
what
have
occur
to
detain
them
from
his
society
.
 
<EOS>
in
reply
to
his
question
on
this
point
,
Mr
Snodgrass
be
about
to
offer
an
historical
account
of
the
circumstance
just
now
detailed
,
when
he
be
suddenly
check
by
observe
that
there
be
present
,
not
only
Mr
Tupman
and
their
stage
-
coach
companion
of
the
precede
day
,
but
another
stranger
of
equally
singular
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
careworn
-
looking
man
,
whose
sallow
face
,
and
deeply
-
sink
eye
,
be
render
still
more
striking
than
Nature
have
make
them
,
by
the
straight
black
hair
which
hang
in
matted
disorder
half
-
way
down
his
face
.
<EOS>
His
eye
be
almost
unnaturally
bright
and
pierce
;
his
cheek
-
bone
be
high
and
prominent
;
and
his
jaw
be
so
long
and
lank
,
that
an
observer
would
have
suppose
that
he
be
draw
the
flesh
of
his
face
in
,
for
a
moment
,
by
some
contraction
of
the
muscle
,
if
his
half
-
open
mouth
and
immovable
expression
have
not
announce
that
it
be
his
ordinary
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
round
his
neck
<EOS>
he
wear
a
green
shawl
,
with
the
large
end
straggle
over
his
chest
,
and
make
their
appearance
occasionally
beneath
the
wear
button
-
hole
of
his
old
waistcoat
.
 
<EOS>
His
upper
garment
be
a
long
black
surtout
;
and
below
it
he
wear
wide
drab
trouser
,
and
large
boot
,
run
rapidly
to
seed
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
on
this
uncouth
-
look
person
that
Mr
Winkle
's
eye
rest
,
and
it
be
towards
him
that
Mr
Pickwick
extend
his
hand
when
he
say
,
"
a
friend
of
our
friend

.
 
<EOS>
We
discover
this
morning
that
our
friend

the
theatre
in
this
place

though
he

not
desirous
to

and
this
gentleman

a
member
of

He

about
to
favour
us
with
a
little
anecdote

with
it
,
when
you
enter

the
green
-
coated
stranger
of
the
day

to
Mr
Winkle

speak
in
a
low
and
confidential
tone
.

of
paper
from
his
pocket

and
turn
to
Mr
Snodgrass

who
have
just
take
out
his
note

book

say
in
a
hollow
voice

perfectly

with
his

<EOS>
"
I

a
little
in

reply
Mr
Snodgrass

take
aback
by
the
abruptness
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah

make
life
what

music
do
the

strip
the

<EOS>
"

like

at
a
grand
court
show

and
admire
the
silken
dress

gaudy
throng

the
people
who
make
that
finery

uncared
for

unknown

leave
to
sink

to
starve
or
live
,
as
fortune
will
it

"
   
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
"
say
Mr
Snodgrass
:
for
the
sunken
eye
of
the
dismal
man
rest
on
him
,
and
he
feel
it
necessary
to
say
something
.
   
<EOS>
"
go
on

the

Will
you
make
another
glass
before

Mr
Pickwick

<EOS>
the
dismal
man
take
the
hint
,
and
have
mix
a
glass
of
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
and
slowly
swallow
half
of
it
,
open
the
roll
of
paper
and
proceed
,
partly
to
read

and
partly
to
relate

"
there
be
nothing
of
the
marvellous
in
what
I
be
go
to
relate
,
"
say
the
dismal
man
;
"
there
be
nothing
even
uncommon
in
it

<EOS>
want
and
sickness
be
too
common
in
many
station
of
life
to
deserve
more
notice
than
be
usually
bestow
on
the
most
ordinary
vicissitude
of
human
nature
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
throw
these
few
note
together
,
because
the
subject
of
them
be
well
known
to
me
for
many
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
trace
his
progress
downwards
,
step
by
step
,
until
at
last
he
reach
that
excess
of
destitution
from
which
he
never
rise
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
the
man
of
whom
I
speak
be
a
low
pantomime
actor
;
and
,
like
many
people
of
his
class
,
an
habitual
drunkard
.
 
<EOS>
in
his
well
day
,
before
he
have
become
enfeeble
by
dissipation
and
emaciate
by
disease
,
he
have
be
in
the
receipt
of
a
good
salary
,
which
,
if
he
have
be
careful
and
prudent
,
he
may
have
continue
to
receive
for
some
year
---
not
many
;
because
these
man
either
die
early
,
or
by
unnaturally
tax
their
bodily
energy
,
lose
,
prematurely
,
those
physical
power
on
which
alone
they
can
depend
for
subsistence

<EOS>
His
besetting
sin
gain
so
fast
upon
him

however

that
it
be
find
impossible

employ
him

useful

fascination

him

he
could
not

and
hopeless
poverty

as
certain
to
be
his
portion
as
death
itself

if
he
persevere
in
the
same
course
;
yet
he
do
persevere
,
and
the
result
may
be
guess

He
could
obtain
no

he
want
bread

side

here
I
see
this
man

clown

the
spectral
figure

Dance
of
Death

the
most
frightful
shape
that
the
able
painter
ever
portray
on
canva
,
never
present
an
appearance
half
so
ghastly
.
 
<EOS>
His
bloated
body
and
shrink
leg
<EOS>

their
deformity
enhance
a
hundredfold
by
the
fantastic
dress

the
glassy
eye

fearfully

the
thick
white
paint
with
which
the
face

grotesquely

ornamented
head

with
paralysis

the
long
skinny
hand

rub
with
white
chalk

all
give
him
a
hideous

unnatural
appearance

of

no

convey
an
adequate
idea

which

to
this

I
shudder

sickness

privation

terminate
as

a

a

in
a
tone

Lieutenant

Doctor

I
would

<EOS>
have

a
look

<EOS>
rise
rage
and
extreme
bewilderment
have
swell
the
noble
breast
of
Mr

almost
to
the
bursting
of
his
waistcoat

during
the
delivery
of
the
above
defiance

<EOS>
He
stand
transfixed
to
the
spot

on
vacancy

to
himself

<EOS>
He

forward
with
fury
in
his
look
,
and
fire
in
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
His
hand
be
upon
the
lock
of
the
door
;
in
another
instant
it
would
have
be
on
the
throat
of
Doctor
Payne
of
the
43rd
,
have
not
Mr
Snodgrass
seize
his
revere
leader
by
the
coat
tail

and
drag
him
backwards

<EOS>
"

Mr
Snodgrass
;
"
Winkle

Tupman

he
must
not

his

such
a
cause

<EOS>
leave
him
alone

"
say
the
green

coated
stranger
;
"
brandy

and

water

jolly
old

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
have
previously
test
the
virtue
of
a
bumper
,
which
have
be
mix
by
the
dismal
man
,
the
stranger
apply
the
glass
to
Mr

mouth
;
and
the
remainder

rapidly
disappear

<EOS>
there
be
a
short
pause

work

a
circle

round
the
table

and
harmony

<EOS>
some
linger
irritability
appear
to
find
a
resting

place
in
Mr
Winkle
's
bosom
,
occasion
possibly
by
the
temporary
abstraction
of
his
coat

though
it
be
scarcely
reasonable
to

that
so
slight

can
have

We

in

now
that
we

we

<EOS>
the
whole
population
of
Rochester
and
the
adjoin
town

from
their
bed
at
an
early
hour
of
the
following
morning
,
in
a
state
of
the
utmost
bustle
and
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
a
grand
review
be
to
take
place
upon
the
line

<EOS>
the
manoeuvre
of
half
a
dozen
regiment

to
be

by
the
eagle
eye
of
the
commander

temporary
fortification

the
citadel

and
a
mine

<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
be
,
as
our
reader
may
have
gather
from
the
slight
extract
we
give
from
his
description
of
Chatham
,
an
enthusiastic
admirer
of
the
army
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
could
have
be
more
delightful
to
him
---
nothing
could
have
harmonise
so
well
with
the
peculiar
feeling
of
each
of
his
companion
---
as
this
sight
.
<EOS>
accordingly
they
be
soon
afoot
,
and
walk
in
the
direction
of
the
scene
of
action
,
towards
which
crowd
of
people
be
already
pour
from
a
variety
of
quarter
.
   
<EOS>
the
appearance
of
everything
on

denote
that
the
approach

one
of

importance

<EOS>
there

place
and
then
to
another
,
and
back
his
horse
among
the
people
,
and
prance
,
and
curvet
,
and
shout
in
a
most
alarming
manner
,
and
make
himself
very
hoarse
in
the
voice
,
and

in
the
face
,
without
any
assignable

<EOS>
officer

run
backwards
and
forwards
,
first
communicate
with
Colonel
Bulder
,
and
then
order
the
sergeant
,
and
then
run
away
altogether
;
and
even
the
very
private
themselves
look
from
behind
their
glaze
stock
with
an
air
of
mysterious
solemnity
,
which
sufficiently
bespeak
the
special
nature
of
the
occasion
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
three
companion
station
themselves
in
the
front
of
the
crowd
,
and
patiently
await
the
commencement
of
the
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
the
throng
be
increase
every
moment
;
and
the
effort
they
be
compel
to
make
,
to
retain
the
position
they
have
gain
,
sufficiently
occupy
their
attention
during
the
two
hour
that
ensue
.
 
<EOS>
at
one
time
there
be
a
sudden
pressure
from
behind
,
and
then
Mr
Pickwick
be
jerk
forward
for
several
yard
,
with
a
degree
of
speed
and
elasticity
highly
inconsistent
with
the
general
gravity
of
his
demeanour
;
at
another
moment
there
be
a
request
to
"
keep
back
"
from
the
front
,
and
then
the
butt
-
end
of
a
musket
be
either
drop
upon
Mr
Pickwick
's
toe
,
to
remind
him
of
the
demand
,
or
thrust
into
his
chest
,
to
insure
its
be
comply
with
.
 
<EOS>
then
some
facetious
gentleman
on
the
left
,
after
press
sideway
in
a
body
,
and
squeeze
Mr
Snodgrass
into
the
very
last
extreme
of
human
torture
,
would
request
to
know
"
vere
he
vos
a
shovin
'
to
"
;
and
when
Mr
Winkle
have
do
express
his
excessive
indignation
at
witness
this
unprovoked
assault
,
some
person
behind
would
knock
his
hat
over
his
eye
,
and
beg
the
favour
of
his
put
his
head
in
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
these
,
and
other
practical
witticism
,
couple
with
the
unaccountable
absence
of
Mr
Tupman
(
who
have
suddenly
disappear
,
and
be
nowhere
to
be
find
)
,
render
their
situation
upon
the
whole
rather
more
uncomfortable
than
pleasing
or
desirable
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
that
low
roar
of
many

run
through
the
crowd
which
usually
announce
the
arrival
of
whatever
they

for

<EOS>
all

gaily
in

glisten
brightly
in
the

,
column
after
column
pour
on
to
the
plain

<EOS>
the
troop
halt
and
form
;
the
word
of
command
ring
through
the
line
;
there
be
a
general
clash
of
musket
as
arm
be
present
;
and
the
commander
-
in

chief
,
attend
by
Colonel
Bulder
and
numerous
officer

canter
to
the
front

the

up
altogether
;
the
horse
stand
upon
two
leg

canter
backwards

and
whisk
their
tail
about
in
all
direction
;
the

bark
,
the
mob
scream
,
the
troop
recover
,
and
nothing
be
to
be
see
on
either
side
,
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
,
but
a
long

<EOS>
Mr

be
right

the
firing

but
he
have
scarcely
time
to
congratulate
himself
on
the
accuracy
of
his
opinion
,
when
a
quick
movement
be
visible
in
the
line
;
the
hoarse
shout
of
the
word
of
command
run
along
it
,
and
before
either
of
the
party
could
form
a
guess
at
the
meaning
of
this
new
manoeuvre
,
the
whole

man
be
but
mortal

and
there
be
a
point
beyond

not
extend

<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
gaze
through
his
spectacle
for
an
instant
on
the
advance
mass

and
then
fairly
turn
his
back
and
---
we
will
not
say
flee
;
firstly
,
because
it
be
an
ignoble
term
,
and
,
secondly
,
because
Mr

figure
be
by
no

adapt
for
that
mode
of
retreat
---
he
trot
away
,
at
as
quick
a
rate
as
his

would
convey
him
;
so
quickly
,
indeed
,
that
he
do
not
perceive
the
awkwardness
of
his
situation
,
to
the
full
extent
,
until
too
late
.
   
<EOS>
the
opposite
troop
,
whose
fall

in
have
perplex
Mr

a
few
second
before
,
be
draw
up
to
repel
the
mimic
attack
of
the
sham
besiegers
of
the
citadel
;
and
the
consequence
be
that
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
two
companion
find
themselves
suddenly
inclose
between
two
line
of
great
length
,
the
one
advance
at
a
rapid
pace

and
the
other
firmly
wait
the
collision

hostile
array

<EOS>
"

officer

Pickwickians

<EOS>
"
Hoi

hoi

hoi

<EOS>
"
be
the
only
reply
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
moment
of
intense
bewilderment
,
a
heavy
tramp
of
footstep
,
a
violent
concussion
,
a
smothered
laugh
;
the
half
-
dozen
regiment
be
half
a
thousand
yard
off
,
and
the
sol
of
Mr
Pickwick

boot
be
elevate
in

<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
and
Mr
Winkle
have
each
perform
a
compulsory
somerset
with
remarkable
agility
,
when
the
first
object
that
meet
the
eye
of
the
latter
as
he
sit
on
the
ground
,
staunch
with
a
yellow
silk
handkerchief
the
stream
of
life
which
issue
from
his
nose
,
be
his
venerate
leader
at
some
distance
off
,
run
after
his
own
hat
,
which
be
gambol
playfully
away
in
perspective
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
very
few
moment
in
a
man
's
existence
when
he
experience
so
much
ludicrous
distress
,
or
meet
with
so
little
charitable
commiseration
,
as
when
he
be
in
pursuit
of
his
own
hat

<EOS>
a
vast
deal
of
coolness
,
and
a
peculiar
degree
of
judgment
,
be
requisite
in
catch
a
hat
.
 
<EOS>
a
man
must
not
be
precipitate
,
or
he
run
over
it
;
he
must
not
rush
into
the
opposite
extreme
,
or
he
lose
it
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
the
good
way
be
to
keep
gently
up
with
the
object
of
pursuit
,
to
be
wary
and
cautious
,
to
watch
your
opportunity
well
,
get
gradually
before
it
,
then
make
a
rapid
dive
,
seize
it
by
the
crown
,
and
stick
it
firmly
on
your
head
;
smile
pleasantly
all
the
time
,
as
if
you
think
it
as
good
a
joke
as
anybody
else
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
fine
gentle
wind
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
's
hat
roll
sportively
before
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
wind
puff
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
puff
,
and
the
hat
roll
over
and
over
as
merrily
as
a
lively
porpoise
in
a
strong
tide
:
and
on
it
may
have
roll
,
far
beyond
Mr
Pickwick

reach
,
<EOS>
have
not
its
course
be
providentially
stop
,
just
as
that
gentleman
be
on
the
point
of
resign
it
to
its
fate
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
we
say
,
be
completely
exhausted
,
and
about
to
give
up
the
chase
,
when
the

some
violence

Mr

briskly
forward

secure
his

breath

He

which

the
tall
old
elm

whose
branch
the
decline
sun
cast
here
and
there
a
rich
ray
of
light
upon
the
shady
part

awaken
the
association

his
early
day

He
picture
himself
as

be
then

cling
to
his

hand

walk
peacefully
to
church

<EOS>
He
remember
how
he
use
to
look
up
into
her
pale
face
;
and
how
her
eye
would
sometimes
fill
with
tear
as
she
gaze
upon
his
feature
---
tear
which
fall
hot
upon
his
forehead
as
she
stoop
to
kiss
him
,
and
make
him
weep
too
,
although
he
little
know
then
what
bitter
tear
her
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
how
often
he
have
run
merrily
down
that
path
with
some
childish
playfellow
,
look
back
,
ever
and
again
,
to
catch
his
mother
's
smile
,
or
hear
her
gentle
voice
;
and
then
a
veil
seem
lift
from
his
memory
,
and
word
of
kindness
unrequite
,
and
warning
despise
,
and
promise
break
,
throng
upon
his
recollection
till
his
heart
fail
him

he
could
bear
it
no

<EOS>
His
step
echo
through
the
low
building
with
a
hollow
sound
,
and
he
almost
fear
to
be
alone
,
it
be
so
still

quiet

He
look
round
him

<EOS>
nothing

<EOS>
the
place
seem
small

it
use

there
be
the
old
monument
on
which
he
have
gaze
with
childish
awe
a
thousand
time
;
the
little
pulpit
with
its
faded
cushion
;
the
Communion
table
before
which
he
have
so
often
repeat
the
Commandments
he
have
reverence
as
a
child

forget
as

desolate

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
perhaps
his

a
poor

possibly
she
have
grow
infirm

could
not

the
church
alone

He
dare
not

he
cast
on

there

enthusiastic
as
we
be
in
the
noble
cause
to

we
have
devote
ourselves

we
should
have
feel
a
sensation

a
consciousness
of
have
do
something
to

could
we

lay
the
faint
outline

<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
,
as
usual
,
take
a
great
mass
of
note
,
which
would
no
doubt
have
afford
most
useful
and
valuable
information
,
have
not
the
burn
eloquence
of
the
word
or
the
feverish
influence
of
the
wine
make
that
gentleman
's
hand
so
extremely
unsteady
,
as
to
render
his
writing
nearly
unintelligible
,
and
<EOS>
his
style
wholly
so
.
 
<EOS>
by
dint
of
patient
investigation
,
we
have
be
enable
to
trace
some
character
bear
a
faint
resemblance
to
the
name
of
the
speaker
;
and
we
can
only
discern
an
entry
of
a
song
(
suppose
to
have
be
sing
by
Mr
Jingle
)
,
in
which
the
word
"
bowl
"
"
sparkle
"
"
ruby
"
"
bright
"
and
"
wine
"
be
frequently
repeat
at
short
interval
.
 
<EOS>
We
fancy
,
too
,
that
we
can
discern
at
the
very
end
of
the
note
,
some
indistinct
reference
to
"
broil
bone
"
;
and
then
the
word
"
cold
"
"
without
"
occur
:
but
<EOS>
as
any
hypothesis
we
could
find
upon
them
must
necessarily
rest
upon
mere
conjecture
,
we
be
not
disposed
to
indulge
in
any
of
the
speculation
to
which
they
may
give
rise
.
   
<EOS>
We
will
therefore
return
to
Mr
Tupman
;
merely
add
that
within
some
few
minute
before
twelve
o'clock
that
night
,
the
convocation
of
worthy
of
Dingley
Dell

feeling

strongly
illustrative

that

<EOS>
the
quiet
seclusion
of

the
presence
of
so
many
of

the

now
appear

the

there

in

walk

a
majesty
in

to

at

they
could
lay
no

distinguish
her
from

there

kindre

sympathetic

evident

<EOS>
Her
name
be
the
first
that
rise
to
Mr

laughter
be

that
fall
upon
his
ear
when
he

but
have
her
agitation
arise
from
an
amiable

feminine
sensibility
which
would
have
be
equally
irrepressible
in
any
case

have
it
be
call
forth
by
a
more
ardent

passionate
feeling
,

he
,
of

these
be
the

His

his
merriment
feign

and
when
at
last
he
lay
his
ache
temple

he
think

with
horrid
delight

on
the
satisfaction
it
would
afford

to
have
Jingle

head

moment

the
dissipation
of

previous
night
,
exert
himself
most
successfully
to
promote
the
hilarity
of
the
breakfast

table

<EOS>
so
successful
be
his
effort
,
that
even
the
deaf
old
lady
insist
on
have
one
or
two
of
his
good
joke
retail
through
the
trumpet
;
and
even
she
condescend
to
observe
to
the
spinster
aunt
,
that
"
He
"
(
mean
Jingle
)
"
be
an
impudent
young
fellow
:
"
a
sentiment
in
which
all
her
relation
then
and
there
present
thoroughly
coincide
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
the
old
lady
's
habit
on
the
fine
summer
morning
to
repair
to
the
arbour
in
which
Mr
Tupman
have
already
signalise
himself
,
in
form
and
manner
follow
:
<EOS>
first
,
the
fat
boy
fetch
from
a
peg
behind
the
old
lady
's
bedroom
door
,
a
close
black
satin
bonnet
,
a
warm
cotton
shawl
,
and
a
thick
stick
with
a
capacious
handle
;
and
the
old
lady
,
have
put
on
the
bonnet
and
shawl
at
her
leisure
,
would
lean
one
hand
on
the
stick
and
the
other
on
the
fat
boy
's
shoulder
,
and
walk
leisurely
to
the
arbour
,
where
the
fat
boy
would
leave
her
to
enjoy
the
fresh
air
for
the
space
of
half
an
hour
;
at
the
expiration
of
which
time
he
would
return
and
reconduct
her
to
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
the
old
lady
be
very
precise
and
very
particular
;
and
as
this
ceremony
have
be
observe
for
three
successive
summer
without
the
slight
deviation
from
the
accustomed
form
,
she
be
not
a
little
surprised
on
this
particular
morning
to
see
the
fat
boy
,
instead
of
leave
the
arbour
,
walk
a
few
pace
out
of
it
,
look
carefully
round
him
in
every
direction
,
and
return
towards
her
with
great
stealth
and
an
air
of
the
most
profound
mystery
.
   
<EOS>
the
old
lady
be
timorous
---
most
old
lady
be
---
and
her
first
impression
be
that
the
bloated
lad
be
about
to
do
her
some
grievous
bodily
harm
with
the
view
of
possess
himself
of
her
loose
coin
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
have
cry
for
assistance
,
but
age
and
infirmity
have
long
ago
deprive
her
of
the
power
of
scream
;
she
,
therefore
,
watch
his
motion
with
feeling
of
intense
horror
which
be
in
no
degree
diminish
by
his
come
close
up
to
her
,
and
shout
in
her
ear
in
an
agitated
,
and
as
it
seem
to
her
,
a
threaten
tone
---
   
"
Missus
!
"
   
<EOS>
now
it
so
happen
that
Mr
Jingle
be
walk
in
the
garden
close
to
the
arbour
at
that
moment
.
 
<EOS>
He
too
hear
the
shout
of
"
Missus
,
"
and
stop
to
hear
more
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
three
reason
for
his
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
he
be
idle
and
curious
;
secondly
,
he
be
by
no
means
scrupulous
;
thirdly
,
and
lastly
,
he
be
conceal
from
view
by
some
flower
shrub
.
 
<EOS>
so
there
he
stand
,
and
there
he
listen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Missus
!
"
shout
the
fat
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
Joe
,
"
say
the
tremble
old
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
have
be
a
good
mistress
to
you
,
Joe
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
invariably
be
treat
very
kindly
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
never
have
too
much
to
do
;
and
you
have
always
have
enough
to
eat
.
"
   
<EOS>
this
last
be
an
appeal
to
the
fat
boy
's
most
sensitive
feeling
.
<EOS>
He
seem
touch
,
as
he
reply
emphatically
---
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
then
what
can
you
want
to
do
now
?
"
say
the
old
lady
,
gain
courage
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
make
your
flesh
creep
,
"
reply
the
boy
.
   
<EOS>
this
sound
like
a
very
bloodthirsty
mode
of

It

full
of
reflection
upon

part
from
the
benevolent
old
gentleman
with
many
expression
of
good

will

esteem

<EOS>
It
be
a
more
difficult
task
to
take
leave
of
the
inmate
of
Manor
Farm
,
from
whom
they
have
receive
so
much
hospitality

kindness

<EOS>
Mr

kiss
the
young
lady

we
be
go
to
say
,
as
if
they
be
his
own
daughter

only
,
as
he
may
possibly
have
infuse
a
little
more
warmth
into
the
salutation
,
the
comparison
would
not
be
quite
appropriate
---
hug
the
old
lady
with
filial
cordiality
;
and
pat
the
rosy
cheek
of
the
female
servant
in
a
most
patriarchal
manner
,
as
he
slip
into
the
hand
of
each
some
more
substantial
expression

his
approval

<EOS>
the
exchange

their
fine

host

Mr

be
even
more
hearty

prolonged

it
be
not

many
a
backward
look
they

slowly
away

many
a
kiss
do
<EOS>
Mr

waft
in
the

in
acknowledgment
of
something
very
like
a

handkerchief

a
turn

lane

have
procure

set
forward
again

a
delightful
walk
it
be
;
for
it
be
a
pleasant
afternoon
in
June

and
their
way
lie
through
a
deep
and
shady
wood
,
cool
by
the
light
wind

gently
rustle
the
thick
foliage

enliven
by

song

architecture

sweep
across

this
opinion

on
the
entrance

that
gentleman
lay
down
his
knife

and
with
a
mournful
air
advance
to
meet
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

They

<EOS>
He
have
attain
one
of
the
great
object
of
his
ambition
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
county
know
to
abound
in
the
remain
of
the
early
age
;
in
a
village
in
which
there
still
exist
some
memorial
of
the
olden
time
,
he
---
he
,
the
chairman
of
the
Pickwick
Club
---
have
discover
a
strange
and
curious
inscription
of
unquestionable
antiquity
,
which
have
wholly
escape
the
observation
of
the
many
learn
man
who
have
precede
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
hardly

"

<EOS>
"
this
treasure
must
be
at
once
deposit
where
it
can
be
thoroughly
investigate
and
properly
understand
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
another
reason
for
this
step
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
few
day
,
an
election
be
to
take
place
for
the
borough
of
Eatanswill
,
at
which
Mr
Perker
,
a
gentleman
whom
I
lately
meet
,
be
the
agent
of
one
of
the
candidate
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
behold
,
and
minutely
examine
,
a
scene
so
interesting
to
every
Englishman
.

<EOS>
"
We
will

be
the
animated
cry

<EOS>
Mr

look
round
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
attachment
and
fervour
of
his
follower
light
up
a
glow
of
enthusiasm
within
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
their
leader
,
and
he
feel
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
let
us
celebrate
this
happy
meeting
with
a
convivial
glass
,
"
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
this
proposition
,
like
the
other
,
be
receive
with
unanimous
applause
.
 
<EOS>
have
himself
deposit
the
important
stone
in
a
small
deal
box
,
purchase
from
the
landlady
for
the
purpose
,
he
place
himself
in
an
arm
-
chair
,
at
the
head
of
the
table
;
and
the
evening
be
devote
to
festivity
and
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
past
eleven
o'clock
---
a
late
hour
for
the
little
village
of
Cobham
---
when
Mr
Pickwick
retire
to
the
bedroom
which
have
be
prepare
for
his
reception
.
 
<EOS>
He
throw
open
the
lattice
window
,
and
set
his
light
upon
the
table
,
fall
into
a
train
of
meditation
on
the
hurried
event
of
the
two
precede
day
.
   
<EOS>
the
hour
and
the
place
be
both
favourable
to
contemplation
;
Mr
Pickwick
be
rouse
by
the
church
clock
striking
twelve
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
stroke
of
the
hour
sound
solemnly
in
his
ear
,
but
when
the
bell
cease
the
stillness
seem
insupportable
---
he
almost
feel
as
if
he
have
lose
a
companion
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
nervous
and
excited
;
and
hastily
undress
himself
and
place
his
light
in
the
chimney
,
get
into
bed
.
   
<EOS>
every
one
have
experience
that
disagreeable
state
of
mind
,
in
which
a
sensation
of
bodily
weariness
in
vain
contend
against
an
inability
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Mr
Pickwick
's
condition
at
this
moment
:
he
toss
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
;
and
perseveringly
close
his
eye
as
if
to
coax
himself
to
slumber
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
of
no
use
.
 
<EOS>
whether
it
be
the
unwonted
exertion
he
have
undergo
,
or
the
heat
,
or
the
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
or
the
strange
bed
---
whatever
it
be
,
his
thought
keep
revert
very
uncomfortably
to
the
grim
picture
downstairs
,
and
the
old
story
to
which
they
have
give
rise
in
the
course
of
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
after
half
an
hour
's
tumble
about
,
he
come
to
the
unsatisfactory
conclusion
,
that
it
be
of
no
use
try
to
sleep
;
so
he
get
up
and
partially
dress
himself
.
 
<EOS>
anything
,
he
think
,
be
well
than
lie
there
fancy
all
kind
of
horror
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
out
of
the
window
<EOS>
---
it
be
very
dark
.
 
<EOS>
He
walk
about
the
room
<EOS>
---
it
be
very
lonely
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
take
a
few
turn
from
the
door
to
the
window
,
and
from
the
window
to
the
door
,
when
the
clergyman
's
manuscript
for
the
first
time
enter
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
good
thought
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
fail
to
interest
him
,
it
may
send
him
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
it
from
his
coat
pocket
,
and
draw
a
small
table
towards
his
bedside
,
trim
the
light
,
put
on
his
spectacle
,
and
compose
himself
to
read
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
strange
handwriting
,
and
the
paper
be
much
soil
and
blot
.
 
<EOS>
the
title
give
him
a
sudden
start
,
too
;
and
he
could
not
avoid
cast
a
wistful
glance
round
the
room
.
<EOS>
reflect
on
the
absurdity
of
give
way
to
such
feeling
,
however
,
he
trim
the
light
again
,
and
read
as
follow
:
---
     
a
MADMAN
's
manuscript
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
!
---
<EOS>
a
madman
's
!
 
<EOS>
how
that
word
would
have
strike
to
my
heart
,
many
year
ago
!
 
<EOS>
how
it
would
have
rouse
the
terror
that
use
to
come
upon
me
sometimes
,
send
the
blood
hiss
and
tingle
through
my
vein
,
till
the
cold
dew
of
fear
stand
in
large
drop
upon
my
skin
,
and
my
knee
knock
together
with
fright
!
 
<EOS>
I
like
it
now
though
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
fine
name
.
 
<EOS>
show
me
the
monarch
whose
angry
frown
be
ever
fear
like
the
glare
of
a
madman
's
eye
---
whose
cord
and
axe
be
ever
half
so
sure
as
a
madman
's
gripe
.
 
<EOS>
Ho
!
<EOS>
ho
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
grand
thing
to
be
mad
!
<EOS>
to
be
peep
at
like
a
wild
lion
through
the
iron
bar
---
to
gnash
one
's
tooth
and
howl
,
through
the
long
still
night
,
to
the
merry
ring
of
a
heavy
chain
and
to
roll
and
twine
among
the
straw
,
transport
with
such
brave
music
.
 
<EOS>
Hurrah
for
the
madhouse
!
 
<EOS>
oh
,
it
be
a
rare
place
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
remember
day
when
I
be
afraid
of
be
mad
;
when
I
use
to
start
from
my
sleep
,
and
fall
upon
my
knee
,
and
pray
to
be
spare
from
the
curse
of
my
race
;
when
I
rush
from
the
sight
of
merriment
or
happiness
,
to
hide
myself
in
some
lonely
place
,
and
spend
the
weary
hour
in
watch
the
progress
of
the
fever
that
be
to
consume
my
brain
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
madness
be
mix
up
with
my
very
blood
,
and
the
marrow
of
my
bone
!
<EOS>
that
one
generation
have
pass
away
without
the
pestilence
appear
among
them
,
and
that
I
be
the
first
in
whom
it
would
revive
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
must
be
so
:
<EOS>
that
so
it
always
have
be
,
and
so
it
ever
would
be
:
<EOS>
and
when
I
cower
in
some
obscure
corner
of
a
crowded
room
,
and
see
man
whisper
,
and
point
,
and
turn
their
eye
towards
me
,
I
know
they
be
tell
each
other
of
the
doom
madman
;
and
I
slink
away
again
to
mope
in
solitude
.

"
I
do
this
for
year
;
long
,
long
year

be

<EOS>
the
night
here
be
long
sometimes

very
long

they
be
nothing

the
restless
night

dreadful
dream
I
have
at
that
time

It
make
me
cold

remember
them

large
dusky
form
with
sly
and
jeering
face
crouch
in
the
corner
of
the
room
,
and
bent
over
my
bed
at
night
,
tempt
me
to
madness

They
tell
me
in
low
whisper

that
the
floor

the
old
house
in
which
my
father
die

stain

shed
by

rage
madness

drive
my
finger
into
my

they
scream
into
my
head

the
room
ring
with
it

in
one
generation
before
him
the
madness

that
his

fetter

himself
to
piece

it
well

find
it
out

at
last
it
come
upon

I
wonder

I
could
ever
have
fear
it

myself
with
delight

I

alone

keep
my
secret

quickly
my

have
fall
from

I
could
have
scream

ecstasy

It

curiosity

burning

jealousy
without

be
create

subject

that
Mr

himself
write
a
pamphlet

contain
ninety

six
page

small

twenty

seven

piece

the

that

very
extraordinary

Pickwick
's
,
and
not
presume
to
set
up
our
recollection
against
the
recorded
declaration
of
that
great
man
,
we
have
consult
every
authority
,
bear
upon
the
subject
,
to
which
we
could
possibly
refer
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
trace
every
name
in
schedule
A
and
B
,
without
meet
with
that
of
Eatanswill
;
we
have
minutely
examine
every
corner
of
the
pocket
county
map
issue
for
the
benefit
of
society
by
our
distinguished
publisher
,
and
the
same
result
have
attend
our
investigation
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
therefore
lead
to
believe
that
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
that
anxious
desire
to
abstain
from
give
offence
to
any
,
and
with
those
delicate
feeling
for
which
all
who
know
him
<EOS>
well
know
<EOS>
he
be
so
eminently
remarkable
,
purposely
substitute
a
fictitious
designation
,
for
the
real
name
of
the
place
in
which
his
observation
be
make
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
confirm
in
this
belief
by
a
little
circumstance
,
apparently
slight
and
trivial
in
itself
,
but
when
consider
in
this
point
of
view
,
not
undeserve
of
notice
.
 
<EOS>
in
Mr
Pickwick
's
note
-
book
,
we
can
just
trace
an
entry
of
the
fact
,
that
the
place
of
himself
and
follower
be
book
by
the
Norwich
coach
;
but
this
entry
be
afterwards
line
through
,
as
if
for
the
purpose
of
conceal
even
the
direction
in
which
the
borough
be
situate
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
not
,
therefore
,
hazard
a
guess
upon
the
subject
,
but
will
at
once
proceed
with
this
history
,
content
with
the
material
which
its
character
have
provide
for
us
.
   
<EOS>
It
appear
,
then
,
that
the
Eatanswill
people
,
like
the
people
of
many
other
small
town
,
consider
themselves
of
the
utmost
and
most
mighty
importance
,
and
that
every
man
in
Eatanswill
,
conscious
of
the
weight
that
attach
to
his
example
,
feel
himself
bind
to
unite
,
heart
and
soul
,
with
one
of
the
two
great
party
that
divide
the
town
---
the
blue
and
the
Buffs
.
 
<EOS>
now
the
blue
lose
no
opportunity
of
oppose
the
Buffs
,
and
the
Buffs
lose
no
opportunity
of
oppose
the
blue
;
and
the
consequence
be
,
that
whenever
the
Buffs
and
blue
meet
together
at
public
meeting
,
town
-
hall
,
fair
,
or
market
,
dispute
and
high
word
arise
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
with
these
dissension
it
be
almost
superfluous
to
say
that
everything
in
Eatanswill
be
make
a
party
question
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
Buffs
propose
to
new
skylight
the
market
-
place
,
the
blue
get
up
public
meeting
,
and
denounce
the
proceeding
;
if
the
blue
propose
the
erection
of
an
additional
pump
in
the
High
Street
,
the
Buffs
rise
as
one
man
and
stand
aghast
at
the
enormity
.
<EOS>
there
be
blue
shop
and
buff
shop
,
blue
inn
and
buff
inn
---
there
be
a
blue
aisle
and
a
Buff
aisle
in
the
very
church
itself
.
   
<EOS>
of
course
it
be
essentially
and
indispensably
necessary
that
each
of
these
powerful
party
should
have
its
choose
organ
and
representative
:
<EOS>
and
,
accordingly
,
there
be
two
newspaper
in
the
town
---
the
Eatanswill
GAZETTE
and
the
Eatanswill
INDEPENDENT
;
the
former
advocate
blue
principle
,
and
the
latter
conduct
on
ground
decidedly
buff
.
 
<EOS>
fine
newspaper
they
be
.
 
<EOS>
such
lead
article
,
and
such
spirited
attack
!
---
<EOS>
"
Our
worthless
contemporary
,
the

"
---
"
<EOS>
that
disgraceful
and
dastardly
journal
,
the

that
false

scurrilous

that
vile
and
slanderous
calumniator
,
the

;
"
these

stir
denunciation
,
be
strew
plentifully
over
the
column
of
each

in
every
number
,
and
excited
feeling
of
the
most
intense
delight
and
indignation
in
the
bosom
of
the
townspeople
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
his
usual
foresight
and
sagacity
,
have
choose
a
peculiarly
desirable
moment
for
his
visit
to
the
borough
.
 
<EOS>
never
be
such
a
contest
know
.
 
<EOS>
the
honourable
Samuel
Slumkey
,
of
Slumkey
Hall
,

the
blue
candidate
;
and
Horatio
Fizkin
,
Esq
.
,
of
Fizkin
Lodge
,
near
Eatanswill
,
have
be
prevail
upon
by
his
friend
to
stand
forward
on
the
Buff
interest
.
 
<EOS>
the
GAZETTE
warn
the
elector
of
Eatanswill
that
the
eye
not
only
of
England
,
but
of
the
whole
civilised
world
,
be
upon
them
;
and
the
INDEPENDENT
imperatively
demand
to
know
,
whether
the
constituency
of
Eatanswill
be
the
grand
fellow
they
have
always
take
them
for
,
or
base
and
servile
tool
,
undeserve
alike
of
the
name
of
Englishmen
and
the
blessing
of
freedom
.
 
<EOS>
never
have
such
a
commotion
agitate
the
town
before
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
late
in
the
evening
when
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
companion
,
assist
by
Sam
,
dismount
from
the
roof
of
the
Eatanswill
coach
.
 
<EOS>
large
blue

window
of

be
post
in
every

intimate
,
in
gigantic
letter
,
that
the
honourable
Samuel
Slumkey

committee
sit
there
daily
.
 
<EOS>
a
crowd
of
idler
be
assemble
in
the
road
,
look
at
a
hoarse
man
in
the
balcony
,
who
be
apparently
talk
himself
very
red
in
the
face
in
Mr
Slumkey
's
behalf
;
but
the
force
and
point
of
whose
argument
be
somewhat
impair
by
the
perpetual
beating
of
four
large
drum
which
Mr
Fizkin
's
committee
have
station
at
the
street
corner
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
busy
little
man
beside
him
,
though
,
who
take
off
his
hat
at
interval
and
motion
to
the
people
to
cheer
,
which
they
regularly
do
,
most
enthusiastically
;
and
as
the
red
-
faced
gentleman
go
on
talk
till
he
be
red
in
the
face
than
ever
<EOS>
,
it
seem
to
answer
his
purpose
quite
as
well
as
if
anybody
have
hear
him
.
   
<EOS>
the
Pickwickians
have
no
sooner
dismount
than
they
be
surround
by
a
branch
mob
of
the
honest
and
independent
,
who
forthwith
set
up
three
deafen
cheer
,
which
be
respond
to
by
the
main
body
<EOS>
(
for
it
be
not
at
all
necessary
for
a
crowd
to
know
what
they
be
cheer
about
)
,
swell
into
a
tremendous
roar
of
triumph
,
which
stop
even
the
red
-
faced
man
in
the
balcony
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hurrah
!
"
shout
the
mob
,
in
conclusion
.
   
<EOS>
"
one
cheer
more
,
"
scream
the
little
fugleman
in
the
balcony
,
and
out
shout
the
mob
again
,
as
if
lung
be
cast
-
iron
,
with
steel
work
.
   
<EOS>
"
Slumkey
for
ever
!
"
<EOS>
roar
the
honest
and
independent
.
   
<EOS>
"

"
echo
Mr

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
certainly
not

"
shout
Mr
Pickwick
.
"
<EOS>
Hurrah
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
there
be
another
roaring
,
like
that
of
a
whole
menagerie
when
the
elephant
have
ring
the
bell
for
the
cold
meat
.
   
<EOS>
"
who
be
Slumkey
?
"
whisper
Mr
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
reply
Mr
Pickwick
,
in
the
same
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
.
<EOS>
do
not
ask
any
question
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
always
good
on
these
occasion
to
do
what
the
mob
do

but
suppose
there
be
two
mob
?
"
suggest
Mr

<EOS>
"
shout
with
the
large

"
reply
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
volume
could
not
have
say
more
.
   
<EOS>
They
enter
the
house
,
the
crowd
open
right
and
leave
to
let
them
pass
,
and
cheer
vociferously
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
object
of
consideration
be
to
secure
quarter
for
the
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
we
have
bed
here
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
Mr
Pickwick
,
summon
the
waiter
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
not
know
,
Sir
,
"
reply
the
man
;
"
afraid
we
be
full
,
sir
---
I
will
inquire
,
Sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
away
he
go
for
that
purpose
,
and
presently
return
,
to
ask
whether
the
gentleman
be
"
Blue
.
"
   
<EOS>
as
neither
Mr
Pickwick
nor
his
companion
take
any
vital
interest
in
the
cause
of
either
candidate
,
the
question
be
rather
a
difficult
one
to
answer
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
dilemma
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
bethink
himself
of
his
new
friend
,
Mr
Perker
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
a
gentleman
of
the
name
of
Perker
?
"
inquire
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
Sir
;
honourable
Mr
Samuel
Slumkey
's
agent

<EOS>
"
He
be
blue

I
think
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
then
we
be
blue
,
"
say
Mr
Pickwick
;
but
observe
that
the
man
look
rather
doubtful
at
this
accommodate
announcement
,
he
give
him
his
card
,
and
desire
him
to
present
it
to
Mr
Perker
forthwith
,
if
he
should
happen
to
be
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
the
waiter
retire
;
and
reappear
almost
immediately
with
a
request
that
Mr
Pickwick
would
follow
him
,
lead
the
way
to
a
large
room
on
the
first
floor
,
where
,
seat
at
a
long
table
cover
with
book
and
paper

<EOS>
"

after
repeat
pressing

repeat
protestation
on
that
of
Mr

that
he
could
not
think
of
incommode

trouble
his
amiable
wife

it
be
decide
that
it
be
the
only
feasible
arrangement
that
could
be
make

it
be
make
;

all

have
usually
some
little
weakness

appear
the
more
conspicuous
from
the
contrast

present

<EOS>
if
Mr

have
a
weakness

it
be
,
perhaps
,
that
he
be
rather
too
submissive
to

somewhat
contemptuous

of

We
do
not

justified

storm

burst
of
mirth

of
about

the

so
long

so
loudly

that
both

without

<EOS>
the

have
have
their
inning

a
little
choleric
,
pink
-
faced
man
stand
forward
to
propose
another
fit
and
proper
person
to
represent
the
elector
of
Eatanswill
in
Parliament
;
and
very
swimmingly
the
pink

face
gentleman
would
have
get
on
,
if
he
have
not
be
rather
too
choleric
to
entertain
a
sufficient
perception
of
the
fun
of
the
crowd

<EOS>
but
after
a
very

gentleman
get
from
denounce
those

in
the
mob

to
exchange
defiance
with
the
gentleman
on
the
husting

whereupon
arise
an
uproar
which
reduce
him
to
the
necessity
of
express
his
feeling
by
serious
pantomime
,
which
he
do
,
and
then
leave
the
stage
to
his
seconder

who
deliver
a
write
speech
of
half
an
hour
's
length
,
and
would

and
the

<EOS>
then

Esquire

near
Eatanswill
,
present
himself
for
the
purpose
of
address
the

which
he
no
sooner
do
,
than
the
band
employ
by
the
honourable
Samuel

commence
perform
with
a
power
to
which

trifle

the
Buff

;
on
which
the
blue
crowd
endeavour
to
dispossess
themselves
of
their
very
unpleasant
neighbour
the
Buff
crowd
;
and
a
scene
of
struggle
,
and
push
,
and
fighting
,
succeed
,
to
which
we
can
no
more
do
justice
than
the
mayor
<EOS>
could
,
although
he
issue
imperative
order
to
twelve
constable
to
seize
the
ringleader
,
who
may
amount
in
number
to
two
hundred

at

these
encounter

Horatio
Fizkin
,
Esquire

,
and
his
friend

fierce
and
furious

until
at
last
Horatio

Esquire

beg
to
ask
his
opponent
,
the
honourable
Samuel

whether
that
band

by
his
consent
;
which
question
the
honourable
Samuel
Slumkey
decline
to
answer
,
Horatio
Fizkin
,
Esquire
,
of
Fizkin

,
shake
his
fist
in
the
countenance
of
the
honourable
Samuel

upon
which
the
honourable
Samuel
Slumkey
,
his
blood
be
up
,
defy
Horatio

to
mortal
combat

<EOS>
at
this
violation
of
all
know
rule
and
precedent
of
order
,
the
mayor
command
another
fantasia
on
the
bell

and
declare
that
he
would
bring
before
himself
,
both
Horatio

and
the

<EOS>
upon
this
terrific
denunciation
,
the

<EOS>
the
speech
of
the

a
beautiful
tribute
to

his
suspicion
that
the

and
besotted
infirmity

render
them
unfit

the
commerce

the
prosperity

his
power
to

a
tale

<EOS>
It
be
pleasant
to
turn
from
contemplate
the
strife
and
turmoil
of
political
existence
,
to
the
peaceful
repose
of
private
life
.
 
<EOS>
although
in
reality
no
great
partisan
of
either
side

Mr
Pickwick
be
sufficiently
fire
with
Mr

enthusiasm
,
to
apply
his
whole

attention
to
the
proceeding

of
which
the

country
excursion
with
Mrs

when

in
a
great
measure
cast
upon
their
own
resource

<EOS>
taking
but
little
interest
in
public
affair

they
beguile
their
time
chiefly
with
such
amusement
as

which
be
limit
to
a
bagatelle

board
in
the
first

in

I

no

he

cold

wet

nothing
be
out

the
water

along
in

lonesome

a
tumbler
of
it

way
of
experiment

now
,
if
there
be
one
thing
in
the
whole
range
of
domestic
art
,
which
the
widow
could
manufacture
better
than
another

it
be
this
identical
article

and
the
first
tumbler

adapt
to
Tom
Smart
's
taste
with
such
peculiar
nicety
,
that
he
order
a

<EOS>
hot
punch
be
a
pleasant
thing
,
gentleman
---
an
extremely
pleasant
thing
under
any
circumstance

but
in
that
snug
old
parlour
,
before
the
roar
fire
,
with
the
wind
blow
outside
till
every
timber
in
the
old
house
creak
again
,
Tom
Smart
find
it
perfectly
delightful
.
 
<EOS>
He
order
another
tumbler
,
and
then
another
---
<EOS>
I
be
not
quite
certain
whether
he
do
not
order
another
after
that
---
but
the
more
he
drink
of
the
hot
punch
,
the
more
he
think
of
the
tall
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
confound
his
impudence
!
"
<EOS>
say
Tom
to
himself
,
"
what
business
have
he
in
that
snug
bar
?
 
<EOS>
such
an
ugly
villain
too
!
"
say
Tom

<EOS>
"
if
the
widow
have
any
taste
,
she
may
surely
pick
up
some
well
fellow
than
that

"
 
<EOS>
here
Tom
's
eye
wander
from
the
glass
on
the
chimney
-
piece
to
the
glass
on
the
table
;
and
as
he
feel
himself
become
gradually
sentimental
,
he
empty
the
fourth
tumbler
of
punch
and
order
a
fifth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
Smart
,
gentleman
,
have
always
be
very
much
attach
to
the
public
line
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
long
his
ambition
to
stand
in
a
bar
of
his
own
,
in
a
green
coat
,
knee
-
cord
,
and
top
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
great
notion
of
take
the
chair
at
convivial
dinner
,
and
he
have
often
think
how
well
he
could
preside
in
a
room
of
his
own
in
the
talking
way
,
and
what
a
capital
example
he
could
set
to
his
customer
in
the
drinking
department
.
 
<EOS>
all
these
thing
pass
rapidly
through
Tom
's
mind
as
he
sit
drink
the
hot
punch
by
the
roaring
fire
,
and
he
feel
very
justly
and
properly
indignant
that
the
tall
man
should
be
in
a
fair
way
of
keep
such
an
excellent
house
,
while
he
,
Tom
Smart
,
be
as
far
off
from
it
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
after
deliberate
over
the
two
last
tumbler
,
whether
he
have
not
a
perfect
right
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
the
tall
man
for
have
contrive
to
get
into
the
good
grace
of
the
buxom
widow
,
Tom
Smart
at
last
arrive
at
the
satisfactory
conclusion
that
he
be
a
very
ill
-
use
and
persecute
individual
,
and
have
better
go
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
"
up
a
wide
and
ancient
staircase
the
smart
girl
precede
Tom

shade
the
chamber
candle
with
her
hand
,
to
protect
it
from
the
current
of
air
which
in
such
a
rambling
old
place
may
have
find
plenty
of
room
to
disport
themselves
in
,
without
blow
the
candle
out
,
but
which
do
blow
it
out
nevertheless
---
thus
afford
Tom
's
enemy
an
opportunity
of
assert
that
it
be
he
,
and
not
the
wind

who
extinguish
the
candle
,
and
that

It

good
large

nothing

oaken

the
baggage

but
what
strike
Tom

fancy
most
be
a
strange

grim
-
looking

high
back
chair
,
carve
in
the
most

damask
cushion

round

Tom
would
only
have

it
be
a
queer
chair

there
would
have
be
an
end
of
the
matter

but
there
be
something
about
this
particular
chair
,
and
yet
he
could
not
tell
what
it
be
,
so
odd
and
<EOS>
so
unlike
any
other
piece
of
furniture
he
have
ever
see
,
that
it
seem
to
fascinate
him
.

He
sit
down
before
the
fire

stare
at
the
old
chair
for
half
an
hour

<EOS>
damn
the

it
be
such
a
strange

he
could
not

off
it

"
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Tom
,
slowly
undress
himself
,
and
stare
at
the
old
chair
all
the
while

which
stand
with
a
mysterious
aspect
by
the

<EOS>
"
I
never

very
odd

rather
sage

very
odd

Tom
shake
his

with
an
air

look
at

again

He
could
not

he
get
into

cover
himself
up
warm

fall
asleep

"
in
about
half
an

Tom
wake
up
with
a
start

from
a
confused
dream
of
tall
man

tumbler
of
punch

the
first
object
that
present
itself
to

be
the
queer

I

Tom
to

his

again

no

Tom
gaze
at
the
chair

and
,
suddenly
as
he
look
at
it

a
most
extraordinary
change
seem
to
come
over
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
carving
of
the
back
gradually
assume
the
lineament

expression
of
an
old

shrivel
human
face
;
the
damask
cushion
become
an
antique
,
flap
waistcoat
;
the
round
knob
grow
into
a
couple
of
foot
,
encase
in
red
cloth
slipper
;
and
the
whole
chair
look
like
a
very
ugly
old
man

of
the
previous

with
his
arm
akimbo

Tom
sit
up
in

dispel
the
illusion

he

so

although

at

keep
wink
away

Tom

in

Mr

It

everybody

this

<EOS>
the
morning
come
:
<EOS>
it
be
a
pleasant
sight
to
behold
Mr
Tupman
in
full
brigand
's
costume
,
with
a
very
tight
jacket
,
sit
like
a
pincushion
over
his
back
and
shoulder
,
the
upper
portion
of
his
leg
incase
in
the
velvet
short
,
and
the
low
part
thereof
swathe
in
the
complicate
bandage
to
which
all
brigand
be
peculiarly
attach
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
pleasing
to
see
his
open
and
ingenuous
countenance
,
well
mustachioed
and
cork
,
look
out
from
an
open
shirt
collar
;
and
to
contemplate
the
sugar
-
loaf
hat
,
decorate
with
ribbon
of
all
colour
,
which
he
be
compel
to
carry
on
his
knee
,
inasmuch
as
no

conveyance
with
a
top
to
it
<EOS>
,
would
admit
of
any
man
's
carry
it
between
his
head
and
the
roof

<EOS>
equally
humorous
and
agreeable
be
the
appearance
of
Mr
Snodgrass
in
blue
satin
trunk
and
cloak
,
white
silk
tight
and
shoe
,
and
Grecian
helmet
,
which
everybody
know
<EOS>
(
and
if
they
do

Mr

to
have
be
the
regular
,
authentic

everyday
costume
of
a
troubadour
,
from
the
early
age
down
to
the
time
of
their
final
disappearance
from
the
face
of
the
earth
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
be
pleasant
,
but
this
be
as
nothing
compare
with
the
shouting
of
the
populace
when

carriage
draw
up
,
behind
Mr
Pott
's
chariot
,
which
chariot
itself
draw

and
display
the
great
Pott
accoutre
as
a
russian
officer
of
justice
,
with
a
tremendous
knout
in
his
hand
---
tastefully
typical
of
the
stern
and
mighty
power
of
the
Eatanswill
GAZETTE
,
and
the
fearful
lashing
it
bestow
on
public
offender
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bravo

Mr
Tupman
and
Mr

from

<EOS>
amid

with
that
kind

bland
dignity

his
power

and
know
how
to
exert
it
,
get
into
the
chariot
.
   
<EOS>
then
there
emerge
from
the
house

who
would
have
look
very
like
Apollo
if
she

not
have
a
gown

conduct
by
Mr
Winkle
,
who
,
in
his
light

red
coat
could
not
possibly
have
be
mistake
for
anything
but
a
sportsman

if
he
have
not

<EOS>
last

come
Mr
Pickwick

whom
the

as
loud
as

probably
under
the
impression
that
his
tight
and
gaiter
be
some
remnant
of

dark
age

and
then

They

<EOS>

appear
in

from

retire
to
rest

<EOS>
not
care
to
go
too
near

,
until
the
appoint
time
,
Mr

crouch
into
an
angle
of
the
wall

and
await
its
arrival
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
situation
which
may
well
have
depress
the
spirit
of
many
a
man

<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
however
,
feel
neither
depression
nor
misgiving
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
that
his
purpose
be
in
the
main
a
good
one
,
and
he
place
implicit
reliance
on
the
high
-
minded
Job
.
 
<EOS>
it
be
dull
,
certainly
;
not
to
say
dreary
;
but
a
contemplative
man
can
always
employ
himself
in
meditation
.
 
<EOS>
Mr

have
meditate
himself
into
a
doze
,
when
he
be
rouse
by
the
chime
of
the
neighbouring
church
ring
out
the
hour
---
half
-
past
eleven
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
time
,
"
think
Mr

,
get
cautiously
on
his
foot
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
up
at
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
the
light
have
disappear
,
and
the
shutter
be
closed
---
all
in
bed
,
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
He
walk
on
tiptoe
to
the
door
,
and
give
a
gentle
tap
.
 
<EOS>
two
or
three
minute
pass
without
any
reply
,
he
give
another
tap
rather
louder
,
and
then
another
rather
loud
than
that
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
the
sound
of
foot
be
audible
upon
the
stair
,
and
then
the
light
of
a
candle
shone
through
the
keyhole
of
the
door
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
good
deal
of
unchaining
and
unbolt
,
and
the
door
be
slowly
open
.
   
<EOS>
now
the
door
open
outward
;
and
as
the
door
open
wider
and
wide
,
Mr
Pickwick
recede
behind
it
,
more
and
more
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
his
astonishment
when
he
just
peep
out
,
by
way
of
caution
,
to
see
that
the
person
who
have
open
it
be
---
not
Job
Trotter
,
but
a
servant
-
girl
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
draw
in
his
head
again
,
with
the
swiftness
display
by
that
admirable
melodramatic
performer
,
Punch
,
when
he
lie
in
wait
for
the
flat
-
head
comedian
with
the
tin
box
of
music
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
must
have
be
the
cat
,
Sarah

"
say
the
girl
,
address
herself
to
some
one
in
the
house

<EOS>
"
Puss
,
puss
,
puss
,
---
tit
,
tit
,
tit

"
   
<EOS>
but
no
animal
be
decoy
by
these
blandishment
,
the
girl
slowly
close
the
door
,
and
re
-
fasten
it
;
leave
Mr
Pickwick
draw
up
straight
against
the
wall
.
   
<EOS>
"
this
be
very
curious
,
"
think
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
be
sit
up
beyond
their
usual
hour
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
extremely
unfortunate
,
that
they
should
have
choose
this
night
,
of
all
other
,
for
such
a
purpose
---
exceedingly
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
with
these
thought
,
Mr
Pickwick
cautiously
retire
to
the
angle
of
the
wall
in
which
he
have
be
before
ensconce
;
wait
until
such
time
as
he
may
deem
it
safe
to
repeat
the
signal
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
here
five
minute
,
when
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
be
follow
by
a
loud
peal
of
thunder
that
crash
and
roll
away
in
the
distance
with
a
terrific
noise
---
then
come
another
flash
of
lightning
,
bright
than
the
other
,
and
a
second
peal
of
thunder
louder
than
the
first
;
and
then
down
come
the
rain
,
with
a
force
and
fury
that
sweep
everything
before
it
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
be
perfectly
aware
that
a
tree
be
a
very
dangerous
neighbour
in
a
thunderstorm
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
tree
on
his
right
,
a
tree
on
his
left
,
a
third
before
him
,
and
a
fourth
behind
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
remain
where
he
be
,
he
may
fall
the
victim
of
an
accident
;
if
he
show
himself
in
the
centre
of
the
garden
,
he
may
be
consign
to
a
constable
.
 
<EOS>
once
or
twice
he
try
to
scale
the
wall
,
but
have
no
other
leg
this
time
,
than
those
with
which
Nature
have
furnish
him
,
the
only
effect
of
his
struggle
be
to
inflict
a
variety
of
very
unpleasant
grating
on
his
knee
and
shin
,
and
to
throw
him
into
a
state
of
the
most
profuse
perspiration
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
a
dreadful
situation
,
"
say
Mr
Pickwick
,
pause
to
wipe
his
brow
after
this
exercise
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
up
at
the
house
---
all
be
dark
.
 
<EOS>
They
must
be
go
to
bed
now
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
try
the
signal
again
.
   
<EOS>
He
walk
on
tiptoe
across
the
moist
gravel
,
and
tap
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
hold
his
breath
,
and
listen
at
the
key
-
hole
.
 
<EOS>
no
reply
:
very
odd
.
 
<EOS>
another
knock
.
 
<EOS>
He
listen
again
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
low
whispering
inside
,
and
then
a
voice
cry
---
   
<EOS>
"
who
be
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
not
Job
,
"
think
Mr
Pickwick
,
hastily
draw
himself
straight
up
against
the
wall
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
woman
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
have
scarcely
have
time
to
form
this
conclusion
,
when
a
window
above
stair
be
throw
up
,
and
three
or
four
female
voice
repeat
the
query
---
"
who
be
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
dare
not
move
hand
or
foot
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
clear
that
the
whole
establishment
be
rouse
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
up
his
mind
to
remain
where

he

join
in
the
hearty
laughter

which
any
allusion
to
it

in

without

"
once
upon
a
time
,
in
a
very
small
country
town
,
at
a
considerable
distance
from
London
,
there
live
a
little
man
name
Nathaniel
Pipkin
,
who
be
the
parish
clerk
of
the
little
town
,
and
live
in
a
little
house
in
the
little
High
Street
,
within
ten
minute
"
walk
from
the
little
church
;
and
who
be
to
be
find
every
day
,
from
nine
till
four
,
teach
a
little
learning
to
the
little
boy
.
 
<EOS>
Nathaniel
Pipkin
be
a
harmless
,
inoffensive
,
good
-
natured
being
,
with
a
turn
-
up
nose
,
and
rather
turn
-
in
leg
,
a
cast
in
his
eye
,
and
a
halt
in
his
gait
;
and
he
divide
his
time
between
the
church
and
his
school
,
verily
believe
that
there
exist
not
,
on
the
face
of
the
earth
,
so
clever
a
man
as
the
curate
,
<EOS>
so
impose
an
apartment
as
the
vestry
-
room
,
or
so
well
-
order
a
seminary
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
once
,
and
only
once
,
in
his
life
,
Nathaniel
Pipkin
have
see
a
bishop
---
a
real
bishop
,
with
his
arm
in
lawn
sleeve
,
and
his
head
in
a
wig
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
see
him
walk
,
and
hear
him
talk
,
at
a
confirmation
,
on
which
momentous
occasion
<EOS>
Nathaniel
Pipkin
be
so
overcome
with
reverence
and
awe
,
when
the
aforesaid
bishop
lay
his
hand
on
his
head
,
that
he
faint
right
clean
away
,
and
be
bear
out
of
church
in
the
arm
of
the
beadle
.
   
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
great
event
,
a
tremendous
era
,
in
Nathaniel
Pipkin
's
life
,
and
it
be
the
only
one
that
have
ever
occur
to
ruffle
the
smooth
current
of
his
quiet
existence
,
when
happen
one
fine
afternoon
,
in
a
fit
of
mental
abstraction
,
to
raise
his
eye
from
the
slate
on
which
he
be
devise
some
tremendous
problem
in
compound
addition
for
an
offending
urchin
to
solve
,
they
suddenly
rest
on
the
bloom
countenance
of
Maria
Lobbs
,
the
only
daughter
of
old
Lobbs
,
the
great
saddler
over
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
the
eye
of
Mr
Pipkin
have
rest
on
the
pretty
face
of
Maria
Lobbs
many
a
time
and
oft
before
,
at
church
and
elsewhere
;
but
the
eye
of
Maria
Lobbs
have
never
look
so
bright
,
the
cheek
of
Maria
Lobbs
have
never
look
so
ruddy
,
as
upon
this
particular
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
no
wonder
then
,
that
Nathaniel
Pipkin
be
unable
to
take
his
eye
from
the
countenance
of
Miss
Lobbs
;
no
wonder
that
Miss
Lobbs
,
find
herself
stare
at
by
a
young
man
,
withdraw
her
head
from
the
window
out
of
which
she
have
be
peep
,
and
shut
the
casement
and
pull
down
the
blind
;
no
wonder
that
Nathaniel
Pipkin
,
immediately
thereafter
,
fall
upon
the
young
urchin
who
have
previously
offend
,
and
cuff
and
knock
him
about
to
his
heart
's
content
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
be
very
natural
,
and
there
be
nothing
at
all
to
wonder
at
about
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
matter
of
wonder
,
though
,
that
anyone
of
Mr
Nathaniel
Pipkin
's
retire
disposition
,
nervous
temperament
,
and
most
particularly
diminutive
income
,
should
from
this
day
forth
,
have
dare
to
aspire
to
the
hand
and
heart
of
the
only
daughter
of
the
fiery
old
Lobbs
---
of
old
Lobbs
,
the
great
saddler
,
who
could
have
buy
up
the
whole
village
at
one
stroke
of
his
pen
,
and
never
feel
the
outlay
---
<EOS>
old
Lobbs
,
who
be
well
known
to
have
heap
of
money
,
invest
in
the
bank
at
the
near
market
town
---
who
be
report
to
have
countless
and
inexhaustible
treasure
hoard
up
in
the
little
iron
safe
with
the
big
keyhole
,
over
the
chimney
-
piece
in
the
back
parlour
---
and
who
,
it
be
well
know
,
on
festive
occasion
garnish
his
board
with
a
real
silver
teapot
,
cream
-
ewer
,
and
sugar
-
basin
,
which
he
be
will
not
,
in
the
pride
of
his
heart
,
to
boast
should
be
his
daughter
's
property
when
she
find
a
man
to
her
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
repeat
it
,
to
be
matter
of
profound
astonishment
and
intense
wonder
,
that
Nathaniel
Pipkin
should
have
have
the
temerity
to
cast
his
eye
in
this
direction
.
 
<EOS>
but
love
be
blind
;
and
Nathaniel
have
a
cast
in
his
eye
;
and
perhaps
these
two
circumstance
,
take
together
,
prevent
his
see
the
matter
in
its
proper
light
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
if
old
Lobbs
have
entertain
the
most
remote
or
distant
idea
of
the
state
of
the
affection
of
Nathaniel
Pipkin
,
he
would
just
have
raze
the
school
-
room
to
the
ground
,
or
exterminate
its
master
from
the
surface
of
the
earth
,
or
commit
some
other
outrage
and
atrocity
of
an
equally
ferocious
and
violent
description
;
for
he
be
a
terrible
old
fellow
,
be
Lobbs
,
when
his
pride
be
injure
,
or
his
blood
be
up
.
 
<EOS>
Swear
!
 
<EOS>
such
train
of
oath
would
come
roll
and
peal
over
the
way
,
sometimes
,
when
he
be
denounce
the
idleness
of
the
bony
apprentice
with
the
thin
leg
,
that
Nathaniel
Pipkin
would
shake
in
his
shoe
with
horror
,
and
the
hair
of
the
pupil
"
head
would
stand
on
end
with
fright
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
day
after
day
,
when
school
be
over
,
and
the
pupil
go
<EOS>
,
do
Nathaniel
Pipkin
sit
himself
down
at
the
front
window
,
and
,
while
he
feign
to
be
read
a
book
,
throw
sidelong
glance
over
the
way
in
search
of
the
bright
eye
of
Maria
Lobbs
;
and
he
have
not
sit
there
many
day
,
before
the
bright
eye
appear
at
an
upper
window
,
apparently
deeply
engage
in
read
too
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
delightful
,
and
gladden
to
the
heart
of
Nathaniel
Pipkin
.
<EOS>
It
be
something
to
sit
there
for
hour
together
,
and
look
upon
that
pretty
face
when
the
eye
be
cast
down
;
but
when
Maria
Lobbs
begin
to
raise
her
eye
from
her
book
,
and
dart
their
ray
in
the
direction
of
Nathaniel
Pipkin
,
his
delight
and
admiration
be
perfectly
boundless

<EOS>
at
last
,
one
day
when
he
know
old
Lobbs
be
out
,
Nathaniel
Pipkin
have
the
temerity
to
kiss
his
hand
to
Maria
Lobbs
;
and
Maria
Lobbs
,
instead
of
shut
the
window
,
and
pull
down
the
blind
,
kiss
HERS
to
him
,
and
smile
.
 
<EOS>
upon
which
Nathaniel
Pipkin
determine
,
that
,
come
what
may
,
he
would
develop
the
state
of
his
feeling
,
without
further
delay

a
pretty
foot
,
a
gayer
heart

a
more
dimpled
face

or
a
smart
form
,
never
bound
so
lightly
over
the
earth
they
grace
,
as
do
those
of
Maria
Lobbs
,
the
old
saddler
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
roguish
twinkle
in
her
sparkling
eye
,
that
would
have
make
its
way
to
far
less
susceptible
bosom
than
that
of
Nathaniel
Pipkin
;
and
there
be
such
a
joyous
sound
in
her
merry
laugh
,
that
the
stern
misanthrope
must
have
smile
to
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
even
old
Lobbs
himself
,
in
the
very
height
of
his
ferocity
,
could
not
resist
the
coaxing
of
his
pretty
daughter

and
when
she
,
and
her
cousin
Kate
---
an
arch

impudent
-
look
,
bewitch
little
person
---
make
a
dead
set
upon
the
old
man
together
,
as
,
to
say
the
truth
,
they
very
often
do
<EOS>
,
he
could
have
refuse
them
nothing
,
even
have
they
ask
for
a
portion
of
the
countless
and
inexhaustible
treasure
,
which
be
hide
from
the
light

in
the
iron
safe

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nathaniel
Pipkin
's
heart
beat
high
within
him
,
when
he
see
this
entice
little
couple
<EOS>
some
hundred
yard
before
him
one
summer
's
evening
,
in
the
very
field
in
which
he
have
many
a
time
stroll
about
till
night
-
time
,
and
ponder
on
the
beauty
of
Maria
Lobbs
.
 
<EOS>
but
though
he
have
often
think
then
,
how
briskly
he
would
walk
up
to
Maria
Lobbs
and
tell
her
of
his
passion
if
he
could
only
meet
her
,
he
feel
,
now
that
she
be
unexpectedly
before
him
,
all
the
blood
in
his
body
mount
to
his
face
,
manifestly
to
the
great
detriment
of
his
leg
,
which
,
deprive
of
their
usual
portion
,
tremble
beneath
him
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
stop
to
gather
a
hedge
flower
,
or
listen
to
a
bird
,
Nathaniel
Pipkin
stop
too
,
and
pretend
to
be
absorb
in
meditation
,
as
indeed
he
really
be
;
for
he
be
think
what
on
earth
he
should
ever
do
,
when
they
turn
back
,
as
they
inevitably
must
in
time
,
and
meet
him
face
to
face
.
 
<EOS>
but
though
he
be
afraid
to
make
up
to
them
,
he
could
not
bear
to
lose
sight
of
them
;
so
when
they
walk
faster
he
walk
faster
,
when
they
linger
he
linger
,
and
when
they
stop
he
stop
;
and
so
they
may
have
go
on
,
until
the
darkness
prevent
them
,
if
Kate
have
not
look
slyly
back
,
and
encouragingly
beckon
Nathaniel
to
advance
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
Kate
's
manner
that
be
not
to
be
resist
,
and
so
Nathaniel
Pipkin
comply
with
the
invitation
;
and
after
a
great
deal
of
blush
on
his
part
,
and
immoderate
laughter
on
that
of
the
wicked
little
cousin
,
Nathaniel
Pipkin
go
down
on
his
knee
on
the
dewy
grass
,
and
declare
his
resolution
to
remain
there
for
ever
,
unless
he
be
permit
to
rise
the
accepted
lover
of
Maria
Lobbs
.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
,
the
merry
laughter
of
Miss
Lobbs
ring
through
the
calm
evening
air
---
without
seem
to
disturb
it
,
though
;
it
have
such
a
pleasant
sound
---
and
the
wicked
little
cousin
laugh
more
immoderately
than
before
,
and
Nathaniel
Pipkin
blush
deeper
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
Maria
Lobbs
be
more
strenuously
urge
by
the
love
-
wear
little
man
,
turn
away
her
head
,
and
whisper
her
cousin
to
say
,
or
at
all
event
Kate
do
say
,
that
she
feel
much
honour
by
Mr
Pipkin
's
address
;
that
her
hand
and
heart
be
at
her
father
's
disposal
;
but
that
nobody
could
be
insensible
to
Mr
Pipkin
's
merit
.
 
<EOS>
as
all
this
be
say
with
much
gravity
,
and
as
Nathaniel
Pipkin
walk
home
with
Maria
Lobbs
,
and
struggle
for
a
kiss
at
parting
,
he
go
to
bed
a
happy
man
,
and
dream
all
night
long
,
of
soften
old
Lobbs

open
the
strong
box
,
and
marry
Maria

<EOS>
the
next
day
,
Nathaniel
Pipkin
see
old
Lobbs
go
out
upon
his
old
gray
pony
,
and
after
a
great
many
sign
at
the
window
from
the
wicked
little
cousin
,
the
object
and
meaning
of
which
he
could
by
no

the
bony
apprentice
with
the
thin
leg
come
over
to

home
all
night

that

at
six

how

lesson

the
putting

brother
of
Kate
,
whom
Maria
Lobbs
call
"
Henry
,
"
and
who
seem
to
keep
Maria
Lobbs
all
to
himself
,
up
in
one
corner
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
delightful
thing
to
see
affection
in
family
,
but
it
may
be
carry
rather
too
far
,
and
Nathaniel
Pipkin
could
not
help
think
that
Maria
Lobbs
must
be
very
particularly
fond
of
her
relation
,
if
she
pay
as
much
attention
to
all
of
them
as
to
this
individual
cousin
.
 
<EOS>
after
tea
,
too
,
when
the
wicked
little
cousin
propose
a
game
at
blind
man
's
buff
,
it
somehow
or
other
happen
that
Nathaniel
Pipkin
be
nearly
always
blind
,
and
whenever
he
lay
his
hand
upon
the
male
cousin
,
he
be
sure
to
find
that
Maria
Lobbs
be
not
far
off
.
 
<EOS>
and
though
the
wicked
little
cousin
and
the
other
girl
pinch
him
,
and
pull
his
hair
,
and
push
chair
in
his
way
,
and
all
sort
of
thing
,
Maria
Lobbs
never
seem
to
come
near
him
at
all
;
and
once
---
once
---
Nathaniel
Pipkin
could
have
swear
he
hear
the
sound
of
a
kiss
,
follow
by
a
faint
remonstrance
from
Maria
Lobbs
,
and
a
half
-
suppress
laugh
from
her
female
friend
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
be
odd
---
very
odd
---
and
there
be
no
say
what
Nathaniel
Pipkin
may
or
may
not
have
do
,
in
consequence
,
if
his
thought
have
not
be
suddenly
direct
into
a
new
channel
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
circumstance
which
direct
his
thought
into
a
new
channel
be
a
loud
knock
at
the
street
door
,
and
the
person
who
make
this
loud
knock
at
the
street
door
be
no
other
than
old
Lobbs
himself
,
who
have
unexpectedly
return
,
and
be
hammer
away
,
like
a
coffin
-
maker
;
for
he
want
his
supper
.
 
<EOS>
the
alarming
intelligence
be
no
sooner
communicate
by
the
bony
apprentice
with
the
thin
leg
,
than
the
girl
trip
upstairs
to
Maria
Lobbs
's
bedroom
,
and
the
male
cousin
and
Nathaniel
Pipkin
be
thrust
into
a
couple
of
closet
in
the
sitting
-
room
,
for
want
of
any
well
place
of
concealment
;
and
when
Maria
Lobbs
and
the
wicked
little
cousin
have
stow
them
away
,
and
put
the
room
to
right
,
they
open
the
street
door
to
old
Lobbs
,
who
have
never
leave
off
knock
since
he
first
begin
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
it
do
unfortunately
happen
that
old
Lobbs
be
very
hungry
be
monstrous
cross
.
 
<EOS>
Nathaniel
Pipkin
could
hear
him
growl
away
like
an
old
mastiff
with
a
sore
throat
;
and
whenever
the
unfortunate
apprentice
with
the
thin
leg
come
into
the
room
,
so
surely
do
old
Lobbs
commence
swear
at
him
in
a
most
saracenic
and
ferocious
manner
,
though
apparently
with
no
other
end
or
object
than
that
of
ease
his
bosom
by
the
discharge
of
a
few
superfluous
oath
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
some
supper
,
which
have
be
warm
up
,
be
place
on
the
table
,
and
then
old
Lobbs
fall
to
,
in
regular
style
;
and
have
make
clear
work
of
it
in
no
time
,
kiss
his
daughter
,
and
demand
his
pipe
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nature
have
place
Nathaniel
Pipkin
's
knee
in
very
close
juxtaposition
,
but
when
he
hear
old
Lobbs
demand
his
pipe
,
they
knock
together
,
as
if
they
be
go
to
reduce
each
other
to
powder
;
for
,
depend
from
a
couple
of
hook
,
in
the
very
closet
in
which
he
stand
,
be
a
large
,
brown
-
stemmed
,
silver
-
bowl
pipe
,
which
pipe
he
himself
have
see
in
the
mouth
of
old
Lobbs
,
regularly
every
afternoon
and
evening
,
for
the
last
five
year
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
girl
go
downstairs
for
the
pipe
,
and
upstairs
for
the
pipe
,
and
everywhere
but
where
they
know
the
pipe
be
,
and
old
Lobbs
storm
away
meanwhile
,
in
the
most
wonderful
manner
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
he
think
of
the
closet
,
and
walk
up
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
of
no
use
a
little
man
like
Nathaniel
Pipkin
pull
the
door
inward
,
when
a
great
strong
fellow
like
old
Lobbs
be
pull
it
outwards
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Lobbs
give
it
one
tug
,
and
open
it
fly
,
disclose
Nathaniel
Pipkin
stand
bolt
upright
inside
,
and
shake
with
apprehension
from
head
to
foot
.
 
<EOS>
bless
us
!
<EOS>
what
an
appalling
look
<EOS>
old
Lobbs
give
him
,
as
he
drag
him
out
by
the
collar
,
and
hold
him
at
arm
's
length
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
why
,
what
the
devil
do
you
want
here
?
"
say
old
Lobbs
,
in
a
fearful
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nathaniel
Pipkin
could
make
no
reply
,
so
old
Lobbs
shake
him
backwards
and
forwards
,
for
two
or
three
minute
,
by
way
of
arrange
his
idea
for
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
what
do
you
want
here
?
"
<EOS>
roar
Lobbs
<EOS>
;
"
I
suppose
you
have
come
after
my
daughter
,
now
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Old
Lobbs
merely
say
this
as
a
sneer
:
for
he
do
not
believe
that
mortal
presumption
could
have
carry
Nathaniel
Pipkin
so
far
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
his
indignation
,
when
that
poor
man
reply
---
"
"
yes
,
I
do
,
Mr
Lobbs
,
I
do
come
after
your
daughter

love
her

"
   
"
"
why
,
you
snivel
,
wry

faced
,
puny
villain

"
gasp
old
Lobbs
,
paralyse
by
the
atrocious
confession
;
"
what
do
you
mean
by
that

say
this
to
my
face

<EOS>
Damme
,
I
will
throttle
you

"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
by
no
means
improbable
that
old
Lobbs
would
have
carry
his
threat
into
execution
,
in
the
excess
of
his
rage
,
if
his
arm
have
not

a
very
unexpected
apparition
:
to

the
male
cousin
,
who
,
step
out
of
his
closet
,
and
walk
up
to
old
Lobbs

say
---
   
"

Old

open
his

not
wide

Nathaniel

strike

the
old
man
cast
down
his
eye
at

reproof

they
meet
those
of

I
have
hint
once

twice
before

that
they
be
very
bright

though
they
be
tearful

turn
his

as

half
afraid

slyness

draw
her

coaxingly
through
the
old
man

whisper
something
in
his
ear

do
what
he
would

old
Lobbs
could
not
help
break
out
into
a
smile

while
a
tear
steal
down
his
cheek
at
the

time

five
minute
after

themselves
perfectly
happy

old
Lobbs
get
down
the
pipe

smoke
it

it
be
a
remarkable
circumstance
about
that
particular
pipe
of
tobacco

it
be
the
most
soothing

delightful
one

ever
smoke

Nathaniel
Pipkin
think
it
best
to
keep
his

counsel

by
so
do
gradually
rise
into
high
favour

old
Lobbs

teach
him
to
smoke
in
time

sit
out

garden

fine
evening

for
many
year
afterwards

smoking
and
drink
in
great
state

He
soon
recover
the
effect

his
attachment

find
his
name
in
the
parish
register

as
a
witness
to
the
marriage

We

that
Mr

more

because
,
as
Mr

beautifully
observe
,
it
have
somehow
or
other
happen
,
from
time
immemorial
,
that
many
of
the

ablest
philosopher

who
have
be
perfect
light
of
science
in
matter
of

,
have
be
wholly
unable
to
reduce

Mr

's
process
,
like
many
of
our
most
sublime
discovery

be
extremely
simple
.
 
<EOS>
with
the
quickness
and
penetration
of
a
man
of
genius
,
he
have
at
once
observe
that
the
two
great
point
to
be
attain
be
---
first
,
to
discharge
his
piece
without
injury
to
himself
,
and
,
secondly
,
to
do
so
,
without
danger
to
the
bystander
---
<EOS>
obviously
,
the
good
thing
to
do
,
after
surmount
the
difficulty
of
fire
at
all
,
be
to
shut
his
eye
firmly
,
and
fire
into
the
air
.
   
<EOS>
on
one
occasion
,
after
perform
this
feat
,
Mr

,
on

his

beheld
a
plump
partridge
in

<EOS>
He
be
on
the
point
of
congratulate
Mr

invariable
success

when
that
gentleman
advance
towards
him

him
warmly
by

It

for
Mr

<EOS>
the
very
smile

take
as
evidence

the
contrary

from

It

without

any
material
result
worthy
of

note
down

sometimes
expend
his
charge
in
mid

air
,

at
other
send
it
skim
along
so
near
the
surface
of
the
ground

place
the
life
of
the
two

a
rather
uncertain
and
precarious
tenure
.
 
<EOS>
as
a
display
of
fancy

shooting
,
it
be
extremely
varied

curious
;
as
an
exhibition
of
fire
with
any
precise
object
,
it
be
,
upon
the
whole
,
perhaps
a
failure

<EOS>
It
be

"
 
if
it

those

look
first
at

at
Mr

he
would
bury

keenly
out

there
be

however

as
the

it

be

forty

damp

rotten
set
of
chamber

in
one
of
the
most
ancient
inn

that
have
be
shut
up

empty
for
year

year
before

<EOS>
there
be
lot
of
old
woman
's
story
about
the
place
,
and
it
certainly
be
very
far
from
be
a
cheerful
one
;
but
he
be
poor
,
and
the
room
be
cheap
,
and
that
would
have
be
quite
a
sufficient
reason
for
him
,
if
they
have
be
ten
time
bad
than
they
really
be

He
be
oblige

take
some
mouldering
fixture
that
be
on

place

,
among
the
rest
,
be
a
great
lumber
wooden
press
for
paper
,
with
large
glass
door
,
and
a
green
curtain
inside
;
a
pretty
useless
thing
for
him

for
he
have
no
paper

put
in
it

as
to
his
clothe

he
carry
them
about
with
him

either

well

move
in
all
his
furniture

it

not

full

sprinkle
it
about
the

make
the
four

possible

down
before
the
fire
at
night

drink
the
first
glass
of
two
gallon

order
on

whether
it

in

many

time

he
,
"
if
I
have
not

at

the
figure
be
tall

thin

the
countenance
expressive
of
care

anxiety

there
be
something
in
the
hue
of
the
skin
,
and
gaunt
and
unearthly

his
face
be
pale
,
haggard
,
and
deject

and
it
do
not
require
the
acute
perception
of
the
man
of
business
,
to
discern
at
a
glance
,
that
disease
or
suffering
have
do
more
to
work
a
change
in
his
appearance

than
the

of

could
have
accomplish
in
twice
the
period
of

Mr

sit
himself
down
in
a
chair
before
the
fire
,
and
fall
into
a
train
of
ramble
meditation
.
 
<EOS>
first
he
think
of
his
friend
,
and
wonder
when
they
would
join
him
;
then
his
mind
revert
to
Mrs
Martha
Bardell
;
and
from
that
lady
it
wander
,
by
a
natural
process
,
to
the
dingy
counting

house
of
Dodson

Fogg
.
 
<EOS>
from
Dodson

's
it
fly
off
at
a
tangent
,
to

very
centre
of
the
history
of
the
queer
client
;
and
then
it
come
back
to
the
Great
White
Horse
at
Ipswich
,
with
sufficient
clearness
to
convince
Mr

that
he
be
fall
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
rouse
himself
,
and
begin
to
undress
,
when
he
recollect
he
have
leave

so
as
it
be
pretty
late
now
,
and
he
be
unwilling

he
slip

into

there
for

for
she
have
bring
a

which

with
praiseworthy
precaution
against

she
have
station
in
a
basin
on
the
floor

where
it
be
glimmer
away

like

It

<EOS>
by

it
be
clear
to
me
that
I
must
have
come
into
the
wrong
room

<EOS>
if
I
call
out
she
will
alarm
the

if
I
remain
here
the
consequence
will
be
still
more
frightful
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
it
be
quite
unnecessary
to
say
,
be
one
of
the
most
modest
and
delicate

minded
of
mortal
.
 
<EOS>
the
very
idea
of
exhibit
his
nightcap
to
a
lady
overpower
him

tie
those

the

there

that
the

at
this
unexpected

by
her
fall
up
against

that
she
persuade
herself
it
must
have
be
the
effect
of
imagination
be
equally
clear

for
when
Mr

under

venture

before
Mr

whatever

<EOS>
He
be
alone
,
in
an
open
passage
,
in
a
strange
house
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
half
dressed
;
it
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
he
could
find
his
way
in
perfect
darkness
to
a
room
which
he
have
be
wholly
unable
to
discover
with
a
light
,
and
if
he
make
the
slight
noise
in
his
fruitless
attempt
to
do
so
,
he
stand
every
chance
of
be
shoot
at

and
perhaps
kill
,
by
some
wakeful
traveller

<EOS>
He
have
no
resource
but
<EOS>
to
remain
where
he
be

<EOS>
so
after

Mr

a
little
recess
in
the

to
wait
for

as
philosophically
as
he
may

<EOS>
He
be
not
destine
,
however

to
undergo
this
additional
trial
of
patience

for
he
have

His

fleshy

have
so
far
extended

that
unless

it

of
the
yard
open
,
and
a
man
have
emerge
therefrom
,
close
the
green
gate
very
carefully
after
him
,
and
walk
briskly
towards
the
very
spot
where
Mr
Weller
be
stand
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
take
this
,
as
an
isolate
fact
,
unaccompanied
by
any
attendant
circumstance
,
there
be
nothing
very
extraordinary
in
it
;
because
in
many
part
of
the
world
man
do
come
out
of
garden
,
close
green
gate
after
them
,
and
even
walk
briskly
away
,
without
attract
any
particular
share
of
public
observation
.
<EOS>
It
be
clear
,
therefore
,
that
there
must
have
be
something
in
the
man
,
or
in
his
manner
,
or
both
,
to
attract
Mr
Weller
's
particular
notice
.
 
<EOS>
whether
there
be
,
or
not
,
we
must
leave
the
reader
to
determine
,
when
we
have
faithfully
record
the
behaviour
of
the
individual
in
question
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
man
have
shut
the
green
gate
after
him
,
he
walk
,
as
we
have
say
twice
already
,
with
a
brisk
pace
up
the
courtyard
;
but
he
no
sooner
catch
sight
of
Mr
Weller
than
he
falter
,
and
stop
,
as
if
uncertain
,
for
the
moment
,
what
course
to
adopt
.
<EOS>
as
the
green
gate
be
close
behind
him
,
and
there
be
no
other
outlet
but
the
one
in
front
,
however
,
he
be
not
long
in
perceive
that
he
must
pass
Mr
Samuel
Weller
to
get
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
therefore
resume
his
brisk
pace
,
and
advanced
,
stare
straight
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
most
extraordinary
thing
about
the
man
be
,
that
he
be
contort
his
face
into
the
most
fearful
and
astonishing
grimace
that
ever
be
behold
.
 
<EOS>
Nature
's
handiwork
never
be
disguise
with
such
extraordinary
artificial
carving
,
as
the
man
have
overlay
his
countenance
with
in
one
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
!
"
say
Mr
Weller
to
himself
,
as
the
man
approach
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
wery
odd
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
ha
'
swore
it
be
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Up
come
the
man
,
and
his
face
become
more
frightfully
distorted
than
ever
,
as
he
draw
nearer
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
take
my
oath
to
that
'
ere
black
hair
and
mulberry
suit
,
"
say
Mr
Weller
;
"
only
I
never
see
such
a
face
as
that
afore
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
as
Mr
Weller
say
this
,
the
man
's
feature
assume
an
unearthly
twinge
,
perfectly
hideous
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
oblige
to
pass
very
near
Sam
,
however
,
and
the
scrutinise
glance
of
that
gentleman
enable
him
to
detect
,
under
all
these
appalling
twist
of
feature
,
something
too
like
the
small
eye
of
Mr
Job
Trotter
to
be
easily
mistake
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
,
you
Sir
!
"
shout
Sam
fiercely
.
   
<EOS>
the
stranger
stop
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
!
"
<EOS>
repeat
Sam
,
still
more
gruffly
.
   
<EOS>
the
man
with
the
horrible
face
look
,
with
the
great
surprise
,
up
the
court
,
and
down
the
court
,
and
in
at
the
window
of
the
house
---
everywhere
but
at
Sam
Weller
---
and
take
another
step
forward
,
when
he
be
bring
to
again
by
another
shout
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
,
you
sir
!
"
say
Sam
,
for
the
third
time
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
no
pretending
to
mistake
where
the
voice
come
from
now
,
so
the
stranger
,
have
no
other
resource
,
at
last
look
Sam
Weller
full
in
the
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
It

Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"

"
   
<EOS>
as
Mr
Weller
appear
fully
dispose
to
act
up
to
the
spirit
of
this
address
,
Mr
Trotter
gradually
allow
his
face
to
resume
its
natural
expression
;
and
then
give
a
start
of
joy
,
exclaim
,
"

and
with

and
,
fling
his

closely

in

<EOS>
"

indignant
at

I

with
a
tribute

excellent
quality

from

Sir

I

my

very

<EOS>
"
unworthiness

"
resume
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
for
to
show
that
I
be
not
wholly
unworthy
,
sir
,
I
should
take
a
brief
review
of
my
past
life
,
and
present
condition
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
argue
,
by
analogy
,
that
to
anybody
else

I
must
be
a
very
desirable
object
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
then
expatiate
on
the
warmth
of
my
love
,
and
the
depth
of
my
devotion

<EOS>
perhaps
I
may
then
be
tempt
to
seize
her
hand

<EOS>
"
yes

I

that
would

I

continue
Mr

grow
warm
as
the
subject
present
itself
in
more
glowing
colour
before
him

<EOS>
"
I
should
then
,
Sir
,
come
to
the
plain
and
simple
question
,
"
Will
you
have
me
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
be
justified
in
assume
that
upon
this
,
she
would
turn
away
her
head

"
   
<EOS>
"
You
think
that
may
be
take
for
grant

Mr

,
if

do
not
do
that
at

right

it

embarrassing

I

she
would
,
"
say
Mr

<EOS>
"
upon
this
,
sir

I
should
squeeze
her
hand

I

I
think
,
<EOS>
Mr
Magnus
---
that
after
I
have
do
that
,
suppose
there
be
no
refusal
,
I
should
gently
draw
away
the
handkerchief
,
which
my
slight
knowledge
of
human
nature
lead
me
to
suppose
the
lady
would
be
apply
to
her
eye
at
the
moment
,
and
steal
a
respectful
kiss
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
should
kiss
her
,
Mr
Magnus
;

at
this
particular
point
,
I
be
decidedly
of
opinion
that
if
the
lady
be
go
to
take
me
at
all
,
she
would
murmur
into
my
ear
a
bashful
acceptance

do
not
stare
at
me
,
Sir
,
"
say
Mr
Magnus
;
<EOS>
"
I
recollect
your
word
last
night
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
You
come
down
here
,
sir
,
to
expose
the
treachery
and
falsehood
of
an
individual
on
whose
truth
and
honour
you
have
place
implicit
reliance
---
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
here
Mr
Peter
Magnus
indulge
in
a
prolonged
sneer
;
and
take
off
his
green
spectacle
---
which
he
probably
find
superfluous
in
his
fit
of
jealousy
---
roll
his
little
eye
about
,
in
a
manner
frightful
to
behold
.
   
<EOS>
"
eh
?
"
say
Mr
Magnus
;
and
then
he
repeat
the
sneer
with
increase
effect
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
you
shall
answer
it
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
answer
what
?
"
say
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
never
mind
,
sir
,
"
reply
Mr
Magnus
,
stride
up
and
down
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
never
mind
.
"
   
<EOS>
there
must
be
something
very
comprehensive
in
this
phrase
of
"
never
mind
,
"
for
we
do
not
recollect
to
have
ever
witness
a
quarrel
in
the
street
,
at
a
theatre
,
public
room
,
or
elsewhere
,
in
which
it
have
not
be
the
standard
reply
to
all
belligerent
inquiry
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
you
call
yourself
a
gentleman
,
sir
?
"
---
"
never
mind
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
I
offer
to
say
anything
to
the
young
woman
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
---
"
never
mind
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
want
your
head
knock
up
against
that
wall
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
---
"
never
mind
,
sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
observable
,
too
,
that
there
would
appear
to
be
some
hide
taunt
in
this
universal
"
never
mind
,
"
which
rouse
more
indignation
in
the
bosom
of
the
individual
address
,
than
the
most
lavish
abuse
could
possibly
awaken
.
   
<EOS>
We
do
not
mean
to
assert
that
the
application
of
this
brevity
to
himself
,
strike
exactly
that
indignation
to
Mr
Pickwick
's
soul
,
which
it
would
infallibly
have
rouse
in
a
vulgar
breast
.
<EOS>
We
merely
record
the
fact
that
Mr
Pickwick
open
the
room
door
,
and
abruptly
call
out
,
"
Tupman
,
come
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
immediately
present
himself
,
with
a
look
of
very
considerable
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tupman
,
"
say
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
a
secret
of
some
delicacy
,
in
which
that
lady
be
concern
,
be
the
cause
of
a
difference
which
have
just
arise
between
this
gentleman
and
myself
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
assure
him
,
in
your
presence
,
that
it
have
no
relation
to
himself
,
and
be
not
in
any
way
connect
with
his
affair
,
I
need
hardly
beg
you
to
take
notice
that
if
he
continue
to
dispute
it
,
he
express
a
doubt
of
my
veracity
,
which
I
shall
consider
extremely
insulting
.
"
<EOS>
as
Mr
Pickwick
say
this
,
he
look
encyclopedia
at
Mr
Peter
Magnus
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
's
upright
and
honourable
bearing
,
couple
with
that
force
and
energy
of
speech
which
so
eminently
distinguish
him
,
would
have
carry
conviction
to
any
reasonable
mind
;
but
,
unfortunately
,
at
that
particular
moment
,
the
mind
of
Mr
Peter
Magnus
be
in
anything
but
reasonable
order
.
 
<EOS>
consequently
,
instead
of
receive
Mr
Pickwick
's
explanation
as
he
ought
to
have
do
,
he
forthwith
proceed
to
work
himself
into
a
red
-
hot
,
scorching
,
consume
passion
,
and
to
talk
about
what
be
due
to
his
own
feeling
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
;
add
force
to
his
declamation
by
stride
to
and
fro
,
and
pull
his
hair
---
amusement
which
he
would
vary
occasionally
,
by
shake
his
fist
in
Mr
Pickwick
's
philanthropic
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
in
his
turn
,
conscious
of
his
own
innocence
and
rectitude
,
and
irritate
by
have
unfortunately
involve
the
middle
-
aged
lady
in
such
an
unpleasant
affair
,
be
not
so
quietly
dispose
as
be
his
will
not
.
 
<EOS>
the
consequence
be
,
that
word
run
high
,
and
voice
higher
;
and
at
length
Mr
Magnus
tell
Mr
Pickwick
he
should
hear
from
him
;
to
which
Mr
Pickwick
reply
,
with
laudable
politeness
,
that
the
sooner
he
hear
from
him
the
well
;
whereupon
the
middle
-
aged
lady
rush
in
terror
from
the
room
,
out
of
which
Mr
Tupman
drag
Mr
Pickwick
,
leave
Mr
Peter
Magnus
to
himself
and
meditation
.
   
<EOS>
if
the
middle
-
aged
lady
have
mingle
much
with
the
busy
world
,
or
have
profit
at
all
by
the
manner
and
custom
of
those
who
make
the
law
and
set
the
fashion
,
she
would
have
know
that
this
sort
of
ferocity
be
the
most
harmless
thing
in
nature
;
but
as
she
have
live
for
the
most
part
in
the
country
,
and
never
read
the
parliamentary
debate
,
she
be
little
versed
in
these
particular
refinement
of
civilised
life
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
when
she
have
gain
her
bedchamber
,
bolt
herself
in
,
and
begin
to
meditate
on
the
scene
she
have
just
witness
,
the
most
terrific
picture
of
slaughter
and
destruction
present
themselves
to
her
imagination
;
among
which
,
a
full
-
length
portrait
of
Mr
Peter
Magnus
bear
home
by
four
man
,
with
the
embellishment
of
a
whole
barrelful
of
bullet
in
his
left
side
,
be
among
the
very
least
.
 
<EOS>
the
more
the
middle
-
aged
lady
meditate
,
the
more
terrified
she
become
;
and
at
length
she
determine
to
repair
to
the
house
of
the
principal
magistrate
of
the
town
,
and
request
him
to
secure
the
person
of
Mr
Pickwick
and
Mr
Tupman
without
delay
.
   
<EOS>
to
this
decision
the
middle
-
aged
lady
be
impel
by
a
variety
of
consideration
,
the
chief
of
which
be
the
incontestable
proof
it
would
afford
of
her
devotion
to
Mr
Peter
Magnus
,
and
her
anxiety
for
his
safety
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
too
well
acquainted
with
his
jealous
temperament
to
venture
the
slight
allusion
to
the
real
cause
of
her
agitation
on
behold
Mr
Pickwick
;
and
she
trust
to
her
own
influence
and
power
of
persuasion
with
the
little
man
,
to
quell
his
boisterous
jealousy
,
suppose
that
Mr
Pickwick
be
remove
,
and
no
fresh
quarrel
could
arise
.
 
<EOS>
fill
with
these
reflection
,
the
middle
-
aged
lady
array
herself
in
her
bonnet
and
shawl
,
and
repair
to
the
mayor
's
dwelling
straightway
.

the

long

way

all
of
which
artifice
the
implacable
cod

fish
sturdily
resist
,
until
the
guard
accidentally
hit
him
in
the
very
middle
of
the
basket

whereupon

disappear
into

the
guard
and
Mr

disappear
for
five
minute
,
most
probably
to
get
the
hot
brandy

water
,
for
they
smell
very
strongly
of
it

when
they
return

They

rumble
through

over

length
reach
the
wide

open
country
.
 
<EOS>
the
wheel
skim
over
the
hard
and
frosty
ground
;
and
the
horse
,
burst
into
a
canter
at
a
smart
crack
of
the
whip
,
step
along
the
road
as
if

coach
,
passenger
,

two

another
crack

on

at

smart
gallop

the
horse
toss
their
head
and
rattle
the
harness
,
as
if
in
exhilaration
at
the
rapidity

hold
whip

take
off

with
the
other

and
rest
it
on
his
knee

pull
out
his
handkerchief
,
and
wipe
his
forehead
,
partly
because
he
have
a
habit
of
do
it
,
and
partly
because
it
be
as
well
to
show
the
passenger
how
cool
he
be
,
and
what
an
easy
thing
it
be
to
drive
four

much
practice

pull
on
his
hat
,
adjust
his

more
merrily
than

lively
note
of

bugle
vibrate
in

clear
cold
air

wake
up
the
old
gentleman
inside

carefully
let
down
the
window

way
,
and
stand
sentry
over
the

peep
out

up
again

inform

change
directly
;
on

himself
up

postpone
his
next
nap
until
after
the
stoppage

again

lustily
forth

peep
out

watch
the
coach

a
friendly
nod
with

turn
round
to
take
a
good
long
stare

<EOS>
It
be
the
sort

afternoon

to
take
off

play

Mr

walk
on

converse
merrily

<EOS>
as
they
turn
into
a
lane
they
have
to
cross
,
the
sound
of
many
voice
burst
upon

and
before
they
have
even
have
time
to
form
a
guess
to
whom
they
belong

they
walk
into
the
very
centre

a
fact

Pickwickians

by
the
loud
"
Hurrah

"
which
burst
from
old
Wardle

lip

when
they
appear

<EOS>
first
,
there
be
wardle
himself
,
look
,
if
that
be
possible
,
more
jolly
than
ever

then
there
be
Bella
and
her
faithful
trundle
;
and
,
lastly

there
be
Emily

some
eight
or
ten
young

who
have
all
come
down

who
be
in

happy

important
a
state
as
young

usually
be

on
such
momentous
occasion

and
they
be

one

startle

far

with
their
frolic
and
laughter

<EOS>
the
ceremony
of
introduction

under
such
circumstance

be
very
soon

or
we
should
rather
say
that
the
introduction
be
soon
over
,
without
any
ceremony
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
in
two
minute
thereafter
,
Mr
Pickwick
be
joke
with
the
young
lady
who
would
not
come
over
the
stile
while
he
look
---
or
who
,
have
pretty
foot
and
unexceptionable
ankle
,
prefer
stand
on
the
top
rail
for
five
minute
or
so
,
declare
that
they
be
too
frightened
to
move
---
with
as
much
ease
and
absence
of
reserve
or
constraint
,
as
if
he
have
know
them
for
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
worthy
of
remark
,
too
,
that
Mr
Snodgrass
offer
emily
far
more
assistance
than
the
absolute
terror
of
the
stile
(
although
it
be
full
three
foot
high
,
and
have
only
a
couple
of
step

stone
)
<EOS>
would
seem
to
require
;
while
one
black

eyed
young

a
very
nice
little
pair
of
boot
with
fur
round
the
top

be
observe

very
loudly

Winkle
offer
to
help
her
over
.
   
<EOS>
all
this
be
very
snug

pleasant

<EOS>
and
when
the
difficulty
of
the

be
at
last
surmounted
,
and
they
once
more
entered
on
the
open
field
,
old

Mr

how
they

all

of
the
house

which
the

after

communication
Bella

Trundle

as
red

fire

the
young
lady
with
the
black
eye
and
the
fur
round
the
boot
,
whisper
something
in
Emily
's
ear
,
and
then
glance
archly
at
Mr
Snodgrass
;
to
which
Emily
respond
that
she
be
a
foolish
girl
,
but
turn
very
red
,
notwithstanding
;
and
Mr
Snodgrass
,
who
be
as
modest
as
all
great
genius
usually
be
,
feel
the
crimson
rise
to
the
crown
of
his
head
,
and
devoutly
wish

in
the
inmost
recess
of
his

the
young

aforesaid

with

her

with
the
fur
round
the
top
,
be
all
comfortably
deposit
in
the
adjacent
county

<EOS>
but
if
they
be
social

happy
outside
the

what
be
the
warmth
and
cordiality
of
their

with
pleasure
at
sight
of
Mr
Pickwick
;
and
Emma
bestow
a
half
-
demure
,
half
-
impudent
,
and
all
-
pretty
look
of
recognition
,
on
Mr
Tupman
,
which
be
enough
to
make
the
statue
of
Bonaparte
in
the
passage
,
unfold
his
arm
,
and
clasp
her
within
them
.
   
<EOS>
the
old
lady
be
seat
with
customary
state
in
the
front
parlour
,
but
she
be
rather
cross
,
and
,
by
consequence
,
most
particularly
deaf
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
go
out
herself
,
and
like
a
great
many
other
old
lady
of
the
same
stamp
,
she
be
apt
to
consider
it
an
act
of
domestic
treason
,
if
anybody
else
take
the
liberty
of
do
what
she
could
not
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
bless
her
old
soul
,
she
sit
as
upright
as
she
could
,
in
her
great
chair
,
and
look
as
fierce
as
may
be
 
---
and
that
be
benevolent
after
all
.

here
the

head
,
and
smooth
down

with
tremble

<EOS>
"

Mr

,
"
<EOS>
I

way
.
 
<EOS>
I

expressly
to

a
long
talk
,
and
another
rubber
with

and
we

"
   
<EOS>
the
old
lady
be
rapidly
give
way
,
but
she
do
not
like
to
do
it
all
at
once
;
so
she
only
say

<EOS>
I
can
not
hear

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
Recollect

"
   
<EOS>
the
good
old
lady
hear
this
,
for
her
lip
quiver
as

its
little
infirmity
of
temper
,
and
she
be
not

<EOS>
so

,
and
turn

Mr

say
,
"

"
<EOS>

"
say
Mr

"
and
that
be
the
reason
why
I
would
make
much
of
the
few
that

any
trace
of
the
old
stock
"
---
and
say
this
,
Mr
Pickwick
gently
pull
Bella
towards
him
,
and
bestow
a
kiss
upon
her
forehead
,
bade
her
sit
down
on
the
little
stool
at
her
grandmother
's
foot
.
<EOS>
whether
the
expression
of
her
countenance
,
as
it
be
raise
towards
the
old
lady
's
face
,
call
up
a
thought
of
old
time
,
or
whether
the
old

by
Mr

affectionate
good

nature
,
or
whatever

the
cause

gush
of
silent
tear

<EOS>
a
happy
party
they

that
night

<EOS>
Sedate

solemn

;
and
sound
be
the
sleep
and
pleasant
<EOS>
be
the
dream
that

<EOS>
It
be
a
remarkable
fact
that
those
of
Mr
Snodgrass
bear
constant
reference
to
Emily
Wardle
;
and
that
the
principal
figure
in
Mr
Winkle
's
vision
be
a
young
lady
with
black
eye
,
and
arch
smile
,
and
a
pair
of
remarkably
nice
boot
with
fur
round
the
top

<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
be
awaken
early
in
the
morning
,
by
a
hum
of
voice
and
a
pattering
of
foot
,
sufficient
to
rouse
even
the
fat
boy
from
his
heavy
slumber
.
 
<EOS>
He
sit
up
in
bed
and
listen
.
 
<EOS>
the
female
servant
and
female
visitor
be
run
constantly
to
and
fro
;
and
there
be
such
multitudinous
demand
for
hot
water
,
such
repeat
outcry
for
needle
and
thread
,
and
so
many
half
-
suppress
entreaty
of
"
oh

do
come
and
tie
me
,
there
be
a
dear
!
"
<EOS>
that
Mr
Pickwick
in
his
innocence
begin
to
imagine
that
something
dreadful
must
have
occur
---
when
he
grow
more
awake
,
and
remember
the
wedding
.
 
<EOS>
the
occasion
be
an
important
one
,
he
dress
himself
with
peculiar
care
,
and
descend
to
the
breakfast

room
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
all
the
female

a
bran
new
uniform
of
pink
muslin
gown
with
white
bow
in
their
cap
,
run
about
the
house
in
a
state
of
excitement
and
agitation
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
lady
be
dress
out
in
a
brocaded
gown
,
which
have
not

in
which
it

during
the
whole

<EOS>
Mr
Trundle
be
in
high
feather
and
spirit
,
but
a
little
nervous
withal
.
 
<EOS>
the
hearty
old
landlord
be
try
to
look
very
cheerful
and
unconcerned
,
but
fail
signally
in
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
all
the
girl
be
in
tear
and
white
muslin
,
except
a
select
two
or
three
,
who
be
be
honour
with
a
private
view
of
the
bride
and
bridesmaid
,
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
Pickwickians
be
in
most
bloom
array
;
and
there
be
a
terrific
roaring
on
the
grass
in
front
of
the
house
,
<EOS>
occasion
by
all
the
man

,
and
hobbledehoy
attach

each
of
whom
have
get
a
white
bow
in
his

hole
,
and
all
of
whom
be
cheer
with
might
and
main
;
be
incite
thereto
,
and
stimulate
therein
by
the
precept
and
example
of
Mr
Samuel
Weller
,
who
have
manage
to
become
mighty
popular
already
,
and
be
as
much
at
home
as
if
he
have
be
bear
on
the
land
.
   
<EOS>
a
wedding
be
a
license
subject
to
joke
upon
,
but
there
really
be
no
great
joke
in
the
matter
after
all
;
---
we
speak
merely
of
the
ceremony
,
and
beg
it
to
be
distinctly
understand
that
we
indulge
in
no
hide
sarcasm
upon
a
married
life
.
 
<EOS>
mix
up
with
the
pleasure
and
joy
of
the
occasion
,
be
the
many
regret
at
quit
home
,
the
tear
of
part
between
parent
and
child
,
the
consciousness
of
leave
the
dear
and
kind
friend
of
the
happy
portion
of
human
life
,
to
encounter
its
care
and
trouble
with
other
still
untried
and
little
known
---
natural
feeling
which
we
would
not
render
this
chapter
mournful
by
describe
,
and
which
we
should
be
still
more
unwilling
to
be
suppose
to
ridicule
.
   
<EOS>
let
us
briefly
say
,
then
,
that
the
ceremony
be
perform
by
the
old
clergyman
,
in
the
parish
church
of
Dingley
Dell
,
and
that
Mr
Pickwick
's
name
be
attach
to
the
register
,
still
preserve
in
the
vestry
thereof
;
that
the
young
lady
with
the
black
eye
sign
her
name
in
a
very
unsteady
and
tremulous
manner
;
that
Emily
's
signature
,
as
the
other
bridesmaid
,
be
nearly
illegible
;
that
it
all
go
off
in
very
admirable
style
;
that
the
young
lady
generally
think
it
far
less
shocking
than
they
have
expect
;
and
that
although
the
owner
of
the
black
eye
and
the
arch
smile
inform
Mr
Wardle
that
she
be
sure
she
could
never
submit
to
anything
so
dreadful
,
we
have
the
very
good
reason
for
think
she
be
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
to
all
this
,
we
may
add
,
that
Mr
Pickwick
be
the
first
who
salute
the
bride
,
and
that
in
so
do
he
throw
over
her
neck
a
rich
gold
watch
and
chain
,
which
no
mortal
eye
<EOS>
but
the
jeweller
's
have
ever
behold
before
.
<EOS>
then
,
the
old
church
bell
rang
as
gaily
as
it
could
,
and
they
all
return
to
breakfast
.
<EOS>
"
Vere
do
the
mince
-
pie

Mr

to
the

<EOS>
as
Mr
Weller
make
the
comparison

he
fall
back
a
step
or

to
give
full

to
it

preparation
with
the

this

scene
of
general

most
delightful
struggling

confusion
;
in

Mr

with

veneration
for
the
custom

or
imagine
that
the
value

it
cost

obtain
it
,
scream

leave

until
some
of
the
less

be
on
the
point
of
desisting
,
when
they
all
at
once
find
it
useless
to
resist
any
longer
,
and
submit
to
be
kiss
with
a
good
grace

<EOS>
Mr

Wardle

down

so
long

the

must
be
a

sexton

digger
in

Gabriel

follow

because
a

be
a
sexton

constantly
surround
by
the

therefore
he
should
be
a
morose

melancholy
man

your

be
the
merry
fellow
in

I
once
have
the
honour
of
be
on
intimate

with
a
mute

who
in
private

off

be

be
an
ill

a

himself
towards

churchyard

for
he
have
get
a
grave
to
finish
by
next

,
feel
very
low

he

it

hear
the
loud

around
them

he
mark
the
bustling

consequent
thereupon

steam

across
the
road

before
they
could
knock
at
the
opposite
door

by
half
a
dozen
curly
-
head
little
rascal
who
crowd
round
them
as
they
flock
upstairs
to
spend
the
evening
in
their
Christmas
game
,
Gabriel
smile
grimly
,
and
clutch
the
handle
of
his
spade
with
a
firm
grasp
,
as
he
think
of
measle
,
scarlet
fever
,
thrush
,
whooping
-
cough
,
and
a
good
many
other
source
of
consolation
besides
.
   
<EOS>
"
in
this
happy
frame
of
mind
,
Gabriel
stride
along
,
return
a
short
,
sullen
growl
to
the
good
-
humoured
greeting
of
such
of
his
neighbour
as
now
and
then
pass
him
,
until
he
turn
into
the
dark
lane
which
lead
to
the
churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
Gabriel
have
be
look
forward
to
reach
the
dark
lane
,
because
it
be
,
generally
speak
,
a
nice
,
gloomy
,
mournful
place
,
into
which
the
townspeople
do
not
much
care
to
go
,
except
in
broad
daylight
,
and
when
the
sun
be
shine
;
consequently
,
he
be
not
a
little
indignant
to
hear
a
young
urchin
roar
out
some
jolly
song
about
a
merry
Christmas
,
in
this
very
sanctuary
which
have
be
call
Coffin
Lane
ever
since
the
day
of
the
old
abbey
,
and
the
time
of
the
shave
-
head
monk
.
 
<EOS>
as
Gabriel
walk
on
,
and
the
voice
draw
near
,
he
find
it
proceed
from
a
small
boy
,
who
be
hurry
along
,
to
join
one
of
the
little
party
in
the
old
street
,
and
who
,
partly
to
keep
himself
company
,
and
partly
to
prepare
himself
for
the
occasion
,
be
shout
out
the
song
at
the
high
pitch
of
his
lung
.
 
<EOS>
so
Gabriel
wait
until
the
boy
come
up
,
and
then
dodge
him
into
a
corner
,
and
rap
him
over
the
head
with
his
lantern
five
or
six
time
,
just
to
teach
him
to
modulate
his
voice
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
the
boy
hurry
away
with
his
hand
to
his
head
,
singe
quite
a
different
sort
of
tune
,
Gabriel
Grub
chuckle
very
heartily
to
himself
,
and
enter
the
churchyard
,
lock
the
gate
behind
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
take
off
his
coat
,
set
down
his
lantern
,
and
get
into
the
unfinished
grave
,
work
at
it
for
an
hour
or
so
with
right
good
-
will
.
<EOS>
but
the
earth
be
harden
with
the
frost
,
and
it
be
no
very
easy
matter
to
break
it
up
,
and
shovel
it
out
;
and
although
there
be
a
moon
,
it
be
a
very
young
one
,
and
shed
little
light
upon
the
grave
,

be
in
the
shadow
of
the
church

at
any
other
time

these
obstacle
would
have
make
Gabriel
Grub
very
moody

miserable

he
be
so
well
pleased
with
have
stop
the
small
boy

singing
,
that
he
take
little
heed
of
the
scanty
progress
he
have
make
,
and
look
down
into
the
grave

when
he

work

cheerful

happy

off

<EOS>
at
first
,
he
begin
to
doubt
the
reality
of
his
adventure
,
but
the
acute
pain
in
his
shoulder
when
he
attempt
to
rise
,
assure
him
that
the
kicking
of
the
goblin
be
certainly
not
ideal

He
be

again

Gabriel

get
on

well

pain
in

brush

frost
off
his
coat

put
it
on

hesitate

it

whisk
through

horse
blind

a

kick
off

disturb

some
ten
year
afterwards

rheumatic

tell

continue
down
to

the
believer
in
the
weathercock
tale

have
misplace
their
confidence
once

be
not
easily
prevail
upon
to
part
with
it
again

so
they
look

wise

shrug
their
shoulder

touch
their
forehead

and
murmur
something
about
Gabriel
Grub
have
drink
all
the
holland

then
fall
asleep
on
the

tombstone

they

explain

have
witness

cavern

say
that
he
have
see
the
world

grow
wiser

this
opinion

be

no

a
popular
one

gradually
die
off

be
the
matter
how
it
may

as
Gabriel
Grub
be
afflict
with
rheumatism
to
the
end

his
day

this
story
have
at

one
moral
,
if
it
teach
no
well
one

and
that
is
,
that
if
a
man
turn
sulky
and
drink
by
himself
at
Christmas
time
,
he
may
make
up
his
mind
to
be
not
a
bit
the
well
for
it
:
let
the
spirit
be
never
so
good
,
or
let
them
be
even
as
many
degree
beyond
proof
,
as
those
which
Gabriel
Grub

cavern

<EOS>
Mr

,
consider
,
pull
off
his
glove

put
them
in
his
hat

take
two

after

with
as
much
eagerness
as
if
their
future
prospect

on
their
expedition

<EOS>
It
be
the
most
intensely
interesting
thing
,
to
observe
the
manner
in
which
Mr
Pickwick
perform
his
share
in
the
ceremony
;
to
watch
the
torture
of
anxiety
with
which
he
view
the
person
behind
,
gain
upon
him
at
the
imminent
hazard
of
trip
him
up
;
to
see
him
gradually
expend
the
painful
force
he
have
put
on
at
first
,
and
turn
slowly
round
on
the
slide
,
with
his
face
towards
the
point
from
which
he
have
start
;
to
contemplate
the
playful
smile
which
mantle
on
his
face
when
he
have
accomplish
the
distance
,
and
the
eagerness
with
which
he
turn
round
when
he
have
do
so
,
and
run
after
his
predecessor
,
his
black
gaiter
trip
pleasantly
through
the
snow
,
and
his
eye
beam
cheerfulness
and
gladness
through
his
spectacle

<EOS>
and
when
he
be
knock
down
(
which
happen
upon
the
average
every
third
round
)
,
it
be
the
most
invigorating
sight
that
can
possibly
be
imagine
,
to
behold
him
gather
up
his
hat
,
glove
,
and
handkerchief
,
with
a
glow
countenance
,
and
resume
his
station
in
the

an
ardour

enthusiasm
that
nothing
Could

<EOS>
the
sport

at
its
height

the
slide

at
the
quick
,

laughter

at
the
loud
,
when
a
sharp
smart
crack
be
hear
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
quick
rush
towards
the
bank
,
a
wild
scream
from
the
lady

a
shout
from
Mr
Tupman

large
mass
of
ice

water
bubble
up
over
it

Mr

's
hat
,
glove
,
and
handkerchief
be
float
on
the
surface
;
and
this
be
all
of
Mr
Pickwick
that
anybody
could
see
.
   
<EOS>
Dismay
and
anguish
be
depict
on
every
countenance
;
the
male
turn
pale
,
and
the
female
faint
;
Mr
Snodgrass
and
Mr
Winkle
grasp
each
other
by
the
hand
,
and
gaze
at
the
spot
where
their
leader
have
go
down
,
with
frenzied
eagerness
;
while
Mr
Tupman
,
by
way
of
render
the
prompt
assistance
,
and
at
the
same
time
convey
to
any
person
who
may
be
within
hearing
,
the
clear
possible
notion
of
the
catastrophe

off
across
the
country
at
his
utmost
speed

scream
"
fire

with
all
his

It

at
this
moment

the
hole
with
cautious
step

and
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
be
hold
a
hurried
consultation
with
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
on
the
advisability
of
bleed
the
company
generally
,
as
an
improve
little
bit
of
professional
practice
<EOS>

it
be
at
this
very
moment
,
that
a
face
,
head
,
and
shoulder

emerge
from
beneath
the
water

and
disclose
the
feature

spectacle
of
Mr

"
keep

up

<EOS>
roar
Mr
Winkle
,
deeply
affected
.
 
<EOS>
the
adjuration
be
rather
unnecessary

the
probability
be
,
that
if
Mr
Pickwick
have
decline
to
keep
himself
up
for
anybody
else
's
sake
,
it
would
have
occur
to
him
that
he
may
as
well
do
so

for
his
own
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
feel
the
bottom
there

Wardle

<EOS>
"
yes

certainly

reply
Mr
Pickwick
,
wring
the
water
from
his
head

face

and
gasp
for
breath

<EOS>
"
I
fall
upon
my

I

the
clay

so
much
of
Mr
Pickwick

coat
as
be
yet
visible

bore
testimony
to
the
accuracy
of
this
statement
;
and
as
the
fear
of
the
spectator
be
still
further
relieve
by
the
fat
boy

suddenly
recollect
that

on
by
Sam
Weller
,
he
keep
at
the
very
top
of
his
speed
until
he
reach
the
door
of
Manor
Farm

where
Mr

some
five

and
have
frighten

unalterable
conviction

Old
Wardle
would
not

when
Mr

next
morning

there
be
not

symptom
of
rheumatism
about
him

which
prove
,
as
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
very
justly
observe
,
that
there
be
nothing
like
hot
punch
in
such
case
;
and
that
if
ever
hot
punch

fail
to
act
as
a
preventive

it

merely
because

<EOS>
Breakings

We

<EOS>
although

grown
man

<EOS>
He
have
a
very
nervous
manner
,
and
a
painful
hesitation
in
his
speech
;
it
do
not
appear
to
be
a
natural
defect
,
but
seem
rather
the
result
of
timidity
,
arise
from
the
consciousness
of
be
"
keep
down
"
by
want
of
mean

or
interest

or
impudence

as

He

He

for

"
You

in

I
understand
?
"
say
the
Serjeant
.
   
<EOS>
if
Mr
Phunky
have
be
a
rich
man
,
he
would
have
instantly
send
for
his
clerk
to
remind
him
;
if
he
have
be
a

one
,
he
would
have
apply

recollect

whether
,
in

inquire
the

<EOS>
here
again
,
Mr

should
have
profess
to
have
forget
all

incline
his
head
towards
his
leader
.
   
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
will
take
Mr
Pickwick
away
,
"
say
the
Serjeant
,
"
and

<EOS>
and
---
and
---
hear
anything

.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
have
a
consultation
,
of

"
 
<EOS>
with
that
hint
that
he

be
interrupt
quite
long
enough
,
Mr

Snubbin
,
who
have
be
gradually
grow
more
and
more
abstract
,
apply
his
glass
to
his
eye
for
an
instant
,
bow
slightly
round
,
and
be
once
more
deeply
immersed
in
the
case
before
him
,
which
arise
out
of
an
interminable
lawsuit
,
originate
in
the
act
of
an
individual
,
decease
a
century
or
so
ago
,
who
have
stop
up
a
pathway
lead
from
some
place

nobody

come
from

to
some
other
place

nobody
ever
go
to

<EOS>
Mr
Phunky
would
not
hear
of
pass
through
any
door
until
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
solicitor
have
pass
through
before
him
,
so
it
be
some
time
before
they
get
into
the
Square
;
and
when
they
do
reach
it
,
they
walk
up
and
down
,
and
hold
a
long
conference
,
<EOS>
the
result
of
which
be
,
that
it
be
a
very
difficult
matter
to
say
how
the
verdict
would
go
;
that
nobody
could
presume
to
calculate
on
the
issue
of
an
action
;
that
it
be
very
lucky
they
have
prevent
the
other
party
from
get
Serjeant
Snubbin
;
and
other
topic
of
doubt
and
consolation

common

such
a

a
slight
dispute
between
the
scorbutic
youth
and
the
gentleman
with
the
pink
anchor
;
in
the
course
of
which
,
the
scorbutic
youth
intimate
a
burn
desire
to
pull
the
nose
of
the
gentleman
with
the
emblem
of
hope
;
in
reply
to
which

that
individual
express
his
decide
unwillingness
to
accept
of
any
"
sauce
"
on
gratuitous
term
,
either
from
the
irascible
young
gentleman
with
the
scorbutic
countenance
,
or
any
other
person
who
be
ornament
with
a

<EOS>
when
the
last
"
natural

have

declare
,
and
the
profit
and
loss
account
of
fish
and
sixpence
adjust

to
the
satisfaction
of
all
party
,
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
ring
for
supper
,
and
the
visitor
squeeze
themselves
into
corner
while
it
be
get
ready
.
   
<EOS>
it
be
not
so
easily
get
ready
as
some
people
may
imagine
.
<EOS>
first
of
all
,
it
be
necessary
to
awaken
the
girl
,
who
have
fall
asleep
with
her
face
on
the
kitchen
table
;
this
take
a
little
time
,
and
,
even
when
she
do
answer
the
bell
,
another
quarter
of
an
hour
be
consume
in
fruitless
endeavour
to
impart
to
her
a
faint
and
distant
glimmering
of
reason
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
to
whom
the
order
for
the
oyster
have
be
send
,
have
not
be
tell
to
open
them
;
it
be
a
very
difficult
thing
to
open
an
oyster
with
a
limp
knife
and
a
two
-
pronged
fork
;
and
very
little
be
do
in
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
very
little
of
the
beef
be
do
either
;
and
the
ham
(
which
be
also
from
the
german
-
sausage
shop
round
the
corner
)
<EOS>
be
in
a
similar
predicament
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
there
be
plenty
of
porter
in
a
tin
can
;
and
the
cheese
go
a
great
way
,
for
it
be
very
strong
.
<EOS>
so
upon
the
whole
,
perhaps
,
the
supper
be
quite
as
good
as
such
matter
usually
be
.
   
<EOS>
after
supper
,
another
jug
of
punch
be
put
upon
the
table
,
together
with
a
paper
of
cigar
,
and
a
couple
of
bottle
of
spirit
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
an
awful
pause
;
and
this
awful
pause
be
occasion
by
a
very
common
occurrence
in
this
sort
of
place
,
but
a
very
embarrassing
one
notwithstanding
.
   
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
the
girl
be
wash
the
glass
.
 
<EOS>
the
establishment
boast
four
:
<EOS>
we
do
not
record
the
circumstance
as
at
all
derogatory
to
Mrs
Raddle
,
for
there
never
be
a
lodging
-
house
yet
,
that
be
not
short
of
glass
.
 
<EOS>
the
landlady
's
glass
be
little
,
thin
,
blow
-
glass
tumbler
,
and
those
which
have
be

from
the
public
-
house
be
great
,
dropsical
,
bloated
article
,
each
support
on
a
huge
gouty
leg
.
 
<EOS>
this
would
have
be
in
itself
sufficient
to
have
possess
the
company
with
the
real
state
of
affair
;
but
the
young
woman
of
all
work
have
prevent
the
possibility
of
any
misconception
arise
in
the
mind
of
any
gentleman
upon
the
subject
,
by
forcibly
drag
every
man

glass
away
,
long
before
he
have
finish
his
beer
,
and
audibly
state
,
despite
the
winks
and
interruption
of
Mr

Sawyer
,
that
it
be

and
avail

of
it

<EOS>
the
instant

with
great
minuteness

but
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not

at
that
precise
moment
what
the
anecdote
be
,
although
he
have

with

<EOS>
"

I

set
forth

long
before

have
plenty
of
time
at

saunter
down

far
as
the

great
calmness

philosophy
,
the
numerous

without

have
no
sooner
rest
on

than
he
give

smote

with
energy

something
remotely

rightly

he
step
into

down

out

no
very
easy
task

it
be
always
consider
necessary
in
such

for
the

to
recline
his
head
on
his

his

Had

do
not
know

do
know
that
the

be
then
a
single

be
now
married

<EOS>
Could
not
swear
that
Mrs

should

somebody
else

Thought
Mrs

faint
away
on

because
Pickwick

know
that

faint
away
stone
dead

under

<EOS>
hear

ask

save
the
examination

very
long
and
a
very
emphatic
address
he
deliver
,
in
which
he
bestow
the
high
possible
eulogium
on
the
conduct
and
character
of
Mr
Pickwick
;
but
inasmuch
as
our
reader
be
far
better
able
to
form
a
correct
estimate
of
that
gentleman
's
merit
and
desert
,
than
Serjeant
Snubbin
could
possibly
be
,
we
do
not
feel
call
upon
to
enter
at
any
length
into
the
learned
gentleman
's
observation

He
attempt

show
that
the
letter

merely
related

Mr

dinner

or
to
the
preparation
for
receive
him
in
his
apartment
on
his
return
from
some
country
excursion
.
<EOS>
It
be
sufficient
to
add
in
general
term
,
that
he
do
the
good
he
could
for
Mr
Pickwick
;
and
the
good
,
as
everybody
know
,
on
the
infallible
authority
of
the
old
adage
,
could
do
no
more

<EOS>
Mr
Justice
Stareleigh
sum
up
,
in
the
old
-
establish
and
most
approve
form
.
 
<EOS>
He
read
as
much
of
his
note
to
the
jury
as
he
could
decipher
on
so
short
a
notice
,
and
make
running
-
comment
on
the
evidence
as
he
go
along
.
 
<EOS>
if
Mrs
Bardell
be
right
,
it
be
perfectly
clear
that
Mr
Pickwick
be
wrong
,
and
if
they
think
the
evidence
of
Mrs
Cluppins
worthy
of
credence
they
would
believe
it
,
and
,
if
they
do
not
,
why
,
they
would
not
.
 
<EOS>
if
they
be
satisfied
that
a
breach
of
promise
of
marriage
have
be
commit
they
would
find
for
the
plaintiff
with
such
damage
as
they
think
proper
;
and
if
,
on
the
other
hand
,
it
appear
to
them
that
no
promise
of
marriage
have
ever
be
give
,
they
would
find
for
the
defendant
with
no
damage
at
all

private
room

matter
over

<EOS>
Mr
Weller
shake
his
head
gravely
;
and
it
be
worthy
of
remark
,
as
an
illustration
of
the
manner
in
which
he
take
this
circumstance
to

that
he
do
not
speak
another
word

which

long
a

the

"
Less

there

from

an
old
legend
,
that
the
illustrious
prince
be
afflict
with
leprosy
,
on
his
return
from
reap
a
rich
harvest
of
knowledge
in
Athens
,
shun
the
court
of
his
royal
father
,
and
consort
moodily
with
husbandman
and
pig
.
<EOS>
among
the
herd
(
so
say
the
legend
)
be
a
pig

grave

solemn
countenance

the
prince
have
a
fellow

feeling

a

demeanour

an
animal
superior
to
his
fellow

whose
grunt
be
terrible

and
whose
bite
be
sharp

<EOS>
the
young
prince
sigh
deeply
as
he
look
upon
the
countenance
of
the
majestic
swine
;
he
think
of
his
royal
father
,
and
his
eye
be
bedew
with
tear
.
   
<EOS>
"
this
sagacious
pig
be
fond
of
bathe
in
rich

moist
mud

<EOS>
not

as
common
pig
do
now

to
cool
themselves

do
even
in

(
which
be
a
proof

the
light

have
already
begin
to
dawn
,
though
feebly
)
,
but
in
the
cold
,
sharp
day
of
winter
.
 
<EOS>
His
coat
be
ever
so
sleek
,
and
his
complexion
so
clear
,
that
the
prince
resolve
to
essay
the
purifying
quality
of
the
same
water
that
his
friend
resort
to

He
make
the
trial

famous
bath

the

the
ardour

their
early
friendship

,
alas

the
water
have
be
his
death

imprudently
take
a
bath
at

the
natural
philosopher
be
no

the
unpleasant

He

<EOS>
"
wery
odd

<EOS>
"
perhaps
something
uncommon
have
take
place
,
"
observe
Mrs

.
   
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
something
<EOS>
wery
uncommon
indeed

Sam
,
shake
his

dubiously
;
"
<EOS>
nothing

<EOS>
as
Sam
say
this
,
he
do
what
a
great
many
people
do
when
they
be
uncertain
about
the
writer
of
a
note
---
look
at
the
seal
,
and
then
at
the
front
,
and
then
at
the
back
,
and
then
at
the
side
,
and
then
at
the
superscription
;
and
,
as
a
last
resource
,
think
perhaps
he
may
as
well
look
at
the
inside
,
and
try
to
find
out
from
that
.
   
<EOS>
"

"
You

well
be
sapparise

"
say
the
coachman
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
wenchure
to
state
the
reason
of
this
irrepairabel
loss
to
the
service
,
but
I
will
beg
Mr

to
state
them
himself
,
for
the
improvement
and
imitation
of
his
admire
friend
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
suggestion
be
loudly
approve
of
,
Mr
Whiffers
explain
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
he
certainly
could
have
wish
to
have
continue
to
hold
the
appointment
he
have
just
resign
.
 
<EOS>
the
uniform
be
extremely
rich
and
expensive
,
the
female
of
the
family
be
most
agreeable
,
and
the
duty
of
the
situation
be
not
,
he
be
bind
to
say
,
too
heavy
;
the
principal
service
that
be
require
of
him
,
be
,
that
he
should
look
out
of
the
hall
window
as
much
as
possible
,
in
company
with
another
gentleman
,
who
have
also
resign
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
have
wish
to
have
spare
that
company
the
painful
and
disgusting
detail
on
which
he
be
about
to
enter
,
but
as
the
explanation
have
be
demand
of
him
,
he
have
no
alternative
but
to
state
,
boldly
and
distinctly
,
that
he
have
be
require
to
eat
cold
meat
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
conceive
the
disgust
which
this
avowal
awaken
in
the
bosom
of
the
hearer
.
 
<EOS>
loud
cry
of
"
Shame
,
"
mingle
with
groan
and
hiss
,
prevail
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Whiffers
then
add
that
he
fear
a
portion
of
this
outrage
may
be
trace
to
his
own
forbearing
and
accommodate
disposition
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
distinct
recollection
of
have
once
consent
to
eat
salt
butter
,
and
he
have
,
moreover
,
on
an
occasion
of
sudden
sickness
in
the
house
,
so
far
forget
himself
as
to
carry
a
coal
-
scuttle
up
to
the
second
floor
.
 
<EOS>
He
trust
he
have
not
lower
himself
in
the
good
opinion
of
his
friend
by
this
frank
confession
of
his
fault
;
and
he
hope
the
promptness
with
which
he
have
resent
the
last
unmanly
outrage
on
his
feeling
,
to
which
he
have
refer
,
would
reinstate
him
in
their
good
opinion
,
if
he
have
.

he
mount
the
box
,
and
reach
his
place
of
destination
in
such
time
as

who
go
the

and
back
again
,
twice
a
day
or
more
,
could

<EOS>
He
take
up
his
quarter
at
the
Bush
,
and
design
to
postpone
any
communication
by
letter
with
Mr
Pickwick
until
it
be
probable
that
Mr
Dowler
's
wrath
may
have
in
some
degree
evaporate
,
walk
forth
to
view
the
city
,
which
strike
him
as
be
a
shade
more
dirty
than
any

he
have
ever

have
inspect
the

,

view
the

inquire
his

to
Clifton
,

be
direct
thither
,
take
the
route
which
be
point
out
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
the
pavement
of
Bristol
be
not
the
wide
or
clean
upon
earth
,
so
its
street
be
not
altogether
the
straight
or
least
intricate
;
and
Mr
Winkle
,
be
greatly
puzzle
by
their
manifold
winding
and
twisting
,
look
about
him
for
a
decent
shop
in
which
he
could
apply
afresh
for
counsel
and
instruction
.
   
<EOS>
His
eye
fall
upon
a
newly
-
paint
tenement
which
have
be
recently
convert
into
something
between
a
shop
and
a
private
house
,
and
which
a
red
lamp
,
project
over
the
fanlight
of
the
street
door
,
would
have
sufficiently
announce
as
the
residence
of
a
medical
practitioner
,
even
if
the
word
"
Surgery
"
have
not
be
inscribe
in
golden
character
on

ground
,
above
the
window
of
what
,
in
time
bygone
,
have
be
the
front
parlour
.
<EOS>
think
this
an
eligible
place
wherein
to
make
his
inquiry
,
Mr

step
into
the
little
shop
where
the
gilt

label
drawer

and
find
nobody

,
knock
with
a
half

crown
on
the
counter
,
to
attract
the
attention
of
anybody
who
may
happen
to
be
in
the
back
parlour
,
which
he
judge
to
be
the
innermost
and
peculiar
sanctum
of
the
establishment
,
from
the
repetition
of
the
word
surgery
on
the
door
---
paint
in
white
letter
this
time
,
by
way
of
take
off
the
monotony

at
the
first

a
sound

which
have

interested

hint

that
Mr

a
way

sentimental

the

have
to

at

Mr

perhaps
a

he
have
ever
know

the
cause
of
which
malady
be
briefly
this
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
stay
nearly
three
week
with
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
;
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
be
not
remarkable
for
temperance
,
nor
be
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
for
the
ownership
of
a
very
strong
head
;
the
consequence

My

<EOS>
Mr

require
nothing

recall
the
charming
Arabella
to
his
mind

and
it
be
rather
fortunate
he
do
not

for
the
feature
of
her
brother
Benjamin

unquestionably
have

an
indifferent
refresher

very
,
"
say
Mr

not

<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
be
too
anxious
to
hear
what
be
to
follow
to
express
much
wonderment
at
this
extraordinary
coincidence
,
marvellous
as
it
be
;
so
Mr
Ben
Allen
,
after
a
tear
or
two
,
go
on
to
say
that
,
notwithstanding
all
his
esteem
and
respect
and
veneration
for
his
friend
,
Arabella
have
unaccountably
and
undutifully
evince
the
most
determined
antipathy
to
his
person

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
think
,
"
say
Mr

,
in
conclusion
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
there
be
a
prior
attachment

"
   
<EOS>
"
have
you
any
idea
who
the
object
of
it
may
be
?
"
ask
Mr
Winkle
,
with
great
trepidation
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Ben
Allen
seize
the
poker
,
flourish
it
in
a
warlike
manner
above
his
head
,
inflict
a
savage
blow
on
an
imaginary
skull
,
and
wind
up
by
say
,
in
a
very
expressive
manner
,
that
he
only
wish
he
could
guess
;
that
be
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
show
him
what
I

of
him

"
say
Mr

Allen
.
<EOS>
and
round
go
the
poker
again
,
more
fiercely
than
before
.
   
<EOS>
all
this
be
,
of
course
,
very
soothing
to
the
feeling
of
Mr
Winkle
,
who
remain
silent
for
a
few
minute
;
but
at
length
muster
up
resolution
to
inquire
whether
Miss
Allen
be
in
Kent
.
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
Mr
Ben
Allen
,
lay
aside
the
poker
,
and
look
very
cunning
;
"
I
do
not
think
Wardle
be
exactly
the
place
for
a
headstrong
girl
;
so
,
as
I
be
her
natural
protector
and
guardian
,
our
parent
be
dead
,
I
have
bring
her
down
into
this
part
of
the
country
to
spend
a
few
month
at
an
old
aunt

,
in
a
nice

dull

close
place

<EOS>
I

that
will

Mr

his
thumb
over
his

here

<EOS>
not
a

my

not

"
   
<EOS>
short
as
this
conversation
be
,
it
rouse
in
Mr
Winkle
the
high
degree
of
excitement
and
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
the
suspect
prior
attachment
rankle
in
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Could
he
be
the
object
of
it
?
<EOS>
Could
it
be
for
him
that
the
fair
Arabella
have
look
scornfully
on
the
sprightly
Bob
Sawyer
,
or
have
he
a
successful
rival
?
 
<EOS>
He
determine
to
see
her
,
cost
what
it
may
;
but
here
an
insurmountable
objection
present
itself
,
for
whether
the
explanatory
"
over
that
way
,
"

"
down
there
,
"
of
Mr

mean
three
mile
off

thirty
,
or
three
hundred

he
could
in
no
wise
guess

<EOS>
but
he
have
no
opportunity
of
ponder
over
his
love
just
then
,
for
Bob
Sawyer
's
return
be
the
immediate
precursor
of
the
arrival
of
a
meat

<EOS>
after

,
Mr
Bob

in

in
the
shop

and

to

a
reek
jorum

variety
of
cabalistic
character

<EOS>
these

<EOS>
,
they
start
fair
,
with
great
satisfaction
and
good

fellowship
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
no
singing
,
because
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
say
it
would
not
look
professional
;
but
to
make
amend
for
this
deprivation
there
be
so
much
talk
and
laugh
that
it
may
have
be
hear
,
and
very
likely
be
,
at
the
end
of
the
street

<EOS>
which
conversation
materially
lighten
the
hour
and
improve
the
mind
of
Mr
Bob

boy

who
,
instead
of
devote
the
evening
to
his
ordinary
occupation
of
write
his
name
on
the
counter
,
and
rub
it
out
again
,
peep
through
the
glass
door
,
and
thus

of
Mr

be
rapidly
ripen
into
the
furious

Mr
Ben
Allen
be
fast
relapse
into
the
sentimental
,
and
the
punch
have
well
-
nigh
disappear
altogether
,
when
the
boy
hastily
run
in
,
announce
that
a
young
woman
have
just
come
over
,
to
say
that
Sawyer
late
Nockemorf
be
want
directly
,
a
couple
of
street
off

<EOS>
this
break
up
the
party

<EOS>
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
understand
the
message
,
after
some
twenty
repetition
,
tie
a
wet
cloth
round
his
head
to
sober
himself
,
and
,
have
partially
succeed
,
put
on
his
green
spectacle
and
issue
forth
.
<EOS>
resist
all
entreaty
to
stay
till
he
come
back
,
and
find
it
quite
impossible
to
engage
Mr
Ben
Allen
in
any
intelligible
conversation
on
the
subject
nearest
his
heart
,
or
indeed
on
any
other
,
Mr
Winkle
take
his
departure
,
and
return
to
the
Bush
.
   
<EOS>
the
anxiety
of
his
mind
,
and
the
numerous
meditation
which
Arabella
have
awaken
,
prevent
his
share
of
the
mortar
of
punch
produce
that
effect
upon
him
which
it
would
have
have
under
other
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
after

other
occupant
of
the
room

<EOS>
It
be
rather
a
cool
evening
for
the
season
of
the
year
,
and
the
gentleman
draw
his
chair
aside
to
afford
the
new

comer
a
sight
of
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
what

Mr

feeling
when

to
view
the
face
and
figure
of
the
vindictive
and
sanguinary
Dowler

<EOS>
Mr

's
first
impulse
be
to
give
a
violent
pull
at

that
unfortunately

expect
in
a
gentleman
of
his
ferocity

vigilance

o'clock
in

himself
walk
into
the
coffee

the
Bush

,
and
tell
Sam
with
a
smile
,
to
his
very
great
relief

that
he
have
do
quite
right

and
it
be
unnecessary
for

to
mount
guard
any

"

agreeable

<EOS>
Mr

look
somewhat
stern
at
this
interruption

and
Mr
Pickwick
angrily
request
his
attendant
not
to
jest
with
one
of
the
good
feeling
of
our
nature
;
to
which
Sam
reply
,
"
that
he
would
not

if
he
be
aware
on
it
;
but
there
be
so
many
on

hardly
know'd

be
the
good
one

<EOS>
Mr

then
recount
what
have

relative

state
that
his
object
be
to
gain
an
interview
with

,
and
make
a
formal
disclosure
of
his
passion
;

declare
his
conviction

found
on
certain
dark
hint

muttering
of

Ben

that

wherever

near

and
this
be
his
whole
stock
of
knowledge

suspicion
on
the
subject
.
   
<EOS>
with
this
very
slight
clue
to
guide
him
,
it
be
determine
that
Mr
Weller
should
start
next
morning
on
an
expedition
of
discovery
;
it
be
also
arrange
that
Mr
Pickwick
and
Mr
Winkle
,
who
be
less
confident
of
their
power
,
should
parade
the
town
meanwhile
,
and
accidentally
drop
in
upon
Mr

in
the
course

day

in
the
hope

see

hear
something

away

up
one
street
and
down
another

---
without
meet
with
anything
or
anybody
that
tend
to
throw
the
faint
light
on
the
matter
in
hand
.
<EOS>
many
be
the
colloquy
into
which
Sam
enter
with
groom
who
be
air
horse
on
road
,
and
nursemaid
who
be
air
child
in
lane
;
but
nothing
could
Sam
elicit
from
either
the
first
-
mention
or
the
last
,
which
bear
the
slight
reference
to
the
object
of
his
artfully
-
prosecute
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
many
young
lady
in
a
great
many
house
,
the
great
part
whereof
be
shrewdly
suspect
by
the
male
and
female
domestic
to
be
deeply
attach
to
somebody
,
or
perfectly
ready
to
become
so
,
if
opportunity
afford
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
none
among
these
young
lady
be
Miss
Arabella
Allen
,
the
information
leave
Sam
at
exactly
the
old
point
of
wisdom
at
which
he
have
stand
before
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
struggle
across
the
down
against
a
good
high
wind
,
wonder
whether
it
be
always
necessary
to
hold
your
hat
on
with
both
hand
in
that
part
of
the
country
,
and
come
to
a
shady
by
-
place
,
about
which
be
sprinkle
several
little
villas
of
quiet
and
secluded
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
outside
a
stable
door
at
the
bottom
of
a
long
back
lane
without
a
thoroughfare
,
a
groom
in
undress
be
idle
about
,
apparently
persuade
himself
that
he
be
do
something
with
a
spade
and
a
wheel
-
barrow
.
 
<EOS>
We
may
remark
,
in
this
place
,
that
we
have
scarcely
ever
see
a
groom
near
a
stable
,
in
his
lazy
moment
,
who
have
not
be
,
to
a
great
or
less
extent
,
the
victim
of
this
singular
delusion
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
think
he
may
as
well
talk
to
this
groom
as
to
any
one
else
,
especially
as
he
be
very
tired
with
walk
,
and
there
be
a
good
large
stone
just
opposite
the
wheel
-
barrow
;
so
he
stroll
down
the
lane
,
and
,
seat
himself
on
the
stone
,
open
a
conversation
with
the
ease
and
freedom
for
which
he
be
remarkable
.
   
<EOS>
"

say
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Arternoon

cast

<EOS>
"

"
   
<EOS>
the
surly
groom
look
surly
still
at
this
,
but
not
sufficiently
so
to
produce
any
effect
upon
Sam
,
who
immediately
inquire
,
with
a
countenance
of
great
anxiety
,
whether
his
master
's
name
be
not
Walker
.
   
<EOS>
"

"
   
<EOS>
in
reply
to
this
,
the
groom
wax
very
wroth
,
mutter
a
desire
to
damage
somebody
's
person

but
disappear
without
carry
it
into
execution
,
slam
the

angrily
after

wholly
unheede
Sam

affectionate
request

that
he
would
leave
him
a
lock
of
his
hair
before

<EOS>
Sam
continue
to
sit
on
the
large
stone
,
meditate
upon
what
be
good
to
be
do
,
and
revolve
in
his
mind
a
plan
for
knock
at
all
the
door
within
five
mile
of
Bristol
,
take
them
at
a
hundred
and
fifty
or
two
hundred
a
day
,
and
endeavour
to
find
Miss
Arabella
by
that
expedient
,
when
accident
all
of
a
sudden
threw
in
his
way
what
he
may
have
sit
there
for
a
twelvemonth

yet
not

<EOS>
as
these
be
large

long

and
well
plant

the
house
be
not

at
some
distance
off

the

<EOS>
Sam

heap
outside

that
by

profoundly
turn
over
in

the
difficulty
of

undertaking
,
when
the
gate
open
,
and
a
female
servant
come
out
into
the
lane
to
shake
some
bedside
carpet
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
be
so
very
busy
with
his
own
thought
,
that
it
be
probable
he
would
have
take
no
more
notice
of
the
young
woman
than
just
raise
his
head
and
remark
that
she
have
a
very
neat
and
pretty
figure
,
if
his
feeling
of
gallantry
have
not
be
most
strongly
rouse
by
observe
that
she
have
no
one
to
help
her
,
and
that
the
carpet
seem
too
heavy
for
her
single
strength

<EOS>
Mr
Weller
be
a
gentleman
of
great
gallantry
in
his
own
way
,
and
he
no

remark
this
circumstance
than
he
hastily
rise
from

<EOS>
the
young
lady
,
who
have
be
coyly
affect
not
to
know
that
a
gentleman
be
so
near

turn
round
as
Sam
speak
---
no
doubt
(
indeed
she
say
so
,
afterwards
)
to
decline

offer
from
a
perfect
stranger

when
instead
of

she
start
back

utter
a
half

<EOS>
Sam

little
time

"
   
<EOS>
Sam
ruminate
for
a
few
moment
,
and
finally
hit
upon
the
follow
plan
of
operation
;
that
he
should
return
just
at
dusk
 
---
the
time
at
which
Arabella
invariably
take
her
walk
---
and
,
be
admit
by
Mary
into
the
garden
of
the
house
to
which
she
belong
,
would
contrive
to
scramble
up
the
wall
,
beneath
the
overhang
bough
of
a
large
pear
-
tree
,
which
would
effectually
screen
him
from
observation
;
would
there
deliver
his
message
,
and
arrange
,
if
possible
,
an
interview
on
behalf
of
Mr
Winkle
for
the
ensue
evening
at
the
same
hour
.
 
<EOS>
have
make
this
arrangement
with
great
despatch
,
he
assist
Mary
in
the
long
-
defer
occupation
of
shake
the
carpet
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
half
as
innocent
a
thing
as
it
look
,
that
shake
little
piece
of
carpet
---
<EOS>
at
least
,
there
may
be
no
great
harm
in
the
shaking
,
but
the
folding
be
a
very
insidious
process
.
 
<EOS>
so
long
as
the
shaking
last
,
and
the
two
party
be
keep
the
carpet
's
length
apart
,
it
be
as
innocent
an
amusement
as
can
well
be
devise
;
but
when
the
folding
begin
,
and
the
distance
between
them
get
gradually
lessen
from
one
half
its
former
length
to
a
quarter
,
and
then
to
an
eighth
,
and
then
to
a
sixteenth
,
and
then
to
a
thirty
-
second
,
if
the
carpet
be
long
enough
,
it
become
dangerous
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
know
,
to
a
nicety
,
how
many
piece
of
carpet
be
fold
in
this
instance
,
but
we
can

footstep

by
way

to
make
sundry
diabolical
noise
similar
to
those

afflict
with

not

deprive
her
of

flattering

a

moment

make
the
good
of

attentively

Mr

Mr

about
a
foot
in
diameter

It
be
very
pretty
to

She

<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
stay
not
to
hear
the
encomium
upon
his
friend
.
<EOS>
He
have
drop
from
the
wall
;
throw
himself
at
Arabella
's
foot
;
and
by
this
time
be
plead
the
sincerity
of
his
passion
with
an
eloquence
worthy
even
of
Mr
Pickwick
himself
.
   
<EOS>
while
these
thing
be
go
on
in
the
open
air
,
an
elderly
gentleman
of
scientific
attainment
be
seat
in
his
library
,
two
or
three
house
off
,
write
a
philosophical
treatise

moisten
his
clay

with
a
glass

claret
from

<EOS>
in
the
agony
of
composition
,
the
elderly
gentleman
look
sometimes
at
the
carpet
,
sometimes
at
the
ceiling
,
and
sometimes
at
the
wall
;
and
when
neither
carpet
,
ceiling
,
nor

afford
the
requisite
degree
of
inspiration
,
he
look
out

the
window

<EOS>
in
one
of
these
pause
of
invention
,
the
scientific

be
gaze
abstractedly
on
the
thick
darkness
outside
,
when
he
be
very
much
surprised
by
observe
a
most
brilliant
light
glide
through
the
air
,
at
a
short
distance
above
the
ground
,
and
almost
instantaneously
vanish
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
short
time
the
phenomenon
be
repeat
,
not
once
or
twice
,
but
<EOS>
several
time
;
at
last
the
scientific
gentleman
,
lay
down
his
pen
,
begin
to
consider
to
what
natural
cause
these
appearance
be
to
be
assign
.
   
<EOS>
They
be
not
meteor
;
they
be
too
low
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
not
glow

worm
;
they
be
too
high
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
not
will
-
o'-the

wisps
;
they
be
not
firefly
;
they
be
not
firework
.
 
<EOS>
what
could
they
be
?
 
<EOS>
some
extraordinary
and
wonderful
phenomenon
of
nature
,
which
no
philosopher
have
ever
see
before
;
<EOS>
something
which
it
have
be
reserve
for
him
alone
to
discover
,
and
which
he
should
immortalise
his
name
by
chronicle
for
the
benefit
of
posterity
.
 
<EOS>
full
of
this
idea
,
the
scientific
gentleman
seize
his
pen
again
,
and
commit
to
paper
sundry
note
of
these
unparalleled
appearance
,
with
the
date
,
day
,
hour
,
minute
,
and
precise
second
at
which
they
be
visible
:
all
of
which
be
to
form
the
datum
of
a
voluminous
treatise
of
great
research
and
deep
learning
,
which
should
astonish
all
the
atmospherical
wiseacre
that
ever
draw
breath
in
any
part
of
the
civilised
globe
.
   
<EOS>
He
throw
himself
back
in
his
easy

chair
,
wrap
in
contemplation
of
his
future
greatness
.
 
<EOS>
the
mysterious
light
appear
more
brilliantly
than
before
,
dance
,
to
all
appearance
,
up

down

cross
from
side

orbit
as
eccentric
as
comet
themselves

<EOS>
the
scientific
gentleman
be
a
bachelor
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
wife
to
call
in
and
astonish

so
he
ring
the
bell
for
his
servant
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pruffle

the
scientific

,
"
there

something
very
extraordinary
in

<EOS>
do
you
see
that

say
the
scientific

,
point
out
of
the

again
become
visible

the
cause
for
those

now
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
scientific
gentleman
smilingly
anticipate
Pruffle
's
reply
that
he
could
assign
no
cause
for
them
at
all

<EOS>
Pruffle
meditate
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should

Pruffle
at

<EOS>
and
down
he
go

<EOS>
but
the
scientific

could
not
rest
under
the
idea

the
ingenious
treatise
he
have
project
be
lose
to
the
world
,
which
must
inevitably
be
the
case
if
the
speculation
of
the
ingenious
Mr
Pruffle

in
its
birth

<EOS>
He
put
on
his
hat
and
walk
quickly
down
the
garden
,
determine
to
investigate
the
matter
to
the
very
bottom

<EOS>
now
,
shortly
before
the
scientific
gentleman
walk
out
into
the
garden
,
Mr
Pickwick
have
run
down
the
lane
as
fast
as
he
could
,
to
convey
a
false
alarm
that
somebody
be
come
that
way
;
occasionally
draw
back
the
slide
of
the
dark
lantern
to
keep
himself
from
the
ditch
.
 
<EOS>
the
alarm
be
no
sooner
give

than
Mr
Winkle
scramble
back
over

Mr

Sam

see
a
man

head
peep
out
very
cautiously
within
half
a

give
it
a
gentle
tap
with

a
pace

Introduces
Mr

Mr

bargain

his
head
upon
the
table

and
howl
dismally
.
   
<EOS>
very
much
satisfied

sudden
bringing

careless

a

afraid

as
Sam
conclude

Mr

slowly
retrace
his
step
downstairs

<EOS>
after
a
few
thoughtful
turn
in
the
Painted
Ground
,
which
,
as
it
be
now
dark
,
be
nearly
desert
,
he
intimate
to
Mr
Weller
that
he
think
it
high
time
for
him
to
withdraw
for
the
night
;
request
him
to
seek
a
bed
in
some
adjacent
public
-
house
,
and
return
early
in
the
morning
,
to
make
arrangement
for
the
removal
of
his
master
's
wardrobe
from
the
George
and
Vulture
.
 
<EOS>
this
request
<EOS>
Mr
Samuel
Weller
prepare
to
obey
,
with
as
good
a
grace
as
he
could
assume
,
but
with
a
very
considerable
show
of
reluctance
nevertheless
.
 
<EOS>
He
even
go
so
far
as
to
essay
sundry
ineffectual
hint
regard
the
expediency
of
stretch
himself
on
the
gravel
for
that
night
;
but
find
Mr
Pickwick
obstinately
deaf
to
any
such
suggestion
,
finally
withdraw
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
no
disguise
the
fact
that
Mr
Pickwick
feel
very
low
-
spirited
and
uncomfortable
---
not
for
lack
of
society
,
for
the
prison
be
very
full
,
and
a
bottle
of
wine
would
at
once
have
purchase
the
utmost
good
-
fellowship
of
a
few
choice
spirit
,
without
any
more
formal
ceremony
of
introduction
;
but
he
be
alone
in
the
coarse
,
vulgar
crowd
,
and
feel
the
depression
of
spirit
and
sinking
of
heart
,
naturally
consequent
on
the
reflection
that
he
be
coope
and
cage
up
,
without
a
prospect
of
liberation
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
idea
of
release
himself
by
minister
to
the
sharpness
of
Dodson
&
Fogg
,
it
never
for
an
instant
enter
his
thought
.
   
<EOS>
in
this
frame
of
mind
he
turn
again
into
the
coffee
-
room
gallery
,
and
walk
slowly
to
and
fro
.
 
<EOS>
the
place
be
intolerably
dirty
,
and
the
smell
of
tobacco
smoke
perfectly
suffocate
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
perpetual
slamming
and
banging
of
door
as
the
people
go
in
and
out
;
and
the
noise
of
their
voice
and
footstep
echoed
and
re
-
echo
through
the
passage
constantly
.
 
<EOS>
a
young
woman
,
with
a
child
in
her
arm
,
who
seem
scarcely
able
to
crawl
,
from
emaciation
and
misery
,
be
walk
up
and
down
the
passage
in
conversation
with
her
husband
,
who
have
no
other
place
to
see
her
in
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
pass
Mr
Pickwick
,
he
could
hear
the
female
sob
bitterly
;
and
once
she
burst
into
such
a
passion
of
grief
,
that
she
be
compel
to
lean
against
the
wall
for
support
,
while
the
man
take
the
child
in
his
arm
,
and
try
to
soothe
her
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
's
heart
be
really
too
full
to
bear
it
,
and
he
go
upstairs
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
although
the
warder
's
room
be
a
very
uncomfortable
one
(
be
,
in
every
point
of
decoration
and
convenience
,
several
hundred
degree
inferior
to
the
common
infirmary
of
a
county
jail
)
,
it
have
at
present
the
merit
of
be
wholly
desert
save
by
Mr
Pickwick
himself
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
he
sit
down
at
the
foot
of
his
little
iron
bedstead
,
and
begin
to
wonder
how
much
a
year
the
warder
make
out
of
the
dirty
room
.
 
<EOS>
have
satisfied
himself
,
by
mathematical
calculation
,
that
the
apartment
be
about
equal
in
annual
value
to
the
freehold
of
a
small
street
in
the
suburb
of
London
,
he
take
to
wonder
what
possible
temptation
could
have
induce

imperfect

occasionally
about

Public

they

their
full

firmly
impressed

belief
that
he

continue
to
hammer
away
at

melancholy
strain
imaginable

<EOS>
take
a
man

nightcap
from

unquestionably
one
of
those
which

under
the
denomination
of
practical

<EOS>
view
the
matter
precisely
in
this
light
,
Mr

without
the
slight
intimation
of
his
purpose
,
spring
vigorously
out
of
bed
,
strike
the
Zephyr
<EOS>
so
smart
a
blow
in
the
chest
as
to
deprive
him
of
a
considerable
portion
of
the
commodity
which
sometimes
bear
his

and
then
,
recapture
his
nightcap

boldly
place
himself
in
an
attitude
of
defence

<EOS>
"
now

Mr

appal
his
antagonist

a
display

<EOS>
It
may
have
be
Mr

very
unexpected
gallantry
,

it
may

the
complicated
manner
in

himself
out

fall
all
in

with

to

aware
of
the

of
a
visitor

Mr
Pickwick

after
some
delay
,
step
up
to
the
window
,
and
pull
him
gently
by
the
coat

<EOS>
the
individual

great
swiftness

Mr

what

<EOS>
"
I

Mr

consult
his
ticket

"
<EOS>
I
believe
this
be
twenty

seven

"
   
<EOS>
"
well

the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
I

Mr

it
over

<EOS>
Mr

comply

<EOS>
"
I
think
Roker
may
have
chum
you
somewhere
else

"
say
Mr
Simpson
(
for
it
be
the
leg
)
<EOS>
,
after
a
very
discontented
sort
of
a
pause
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
think
so
also
;
but
,
under
all
the
circumstance
,
he
consider
it
a
matter
of
sound
policy
to
be
silent
.
<EOS>
Mr
Simpson
muse
for
a
few
moment
after
this
,
and
then
,
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
window
,
give
a
shrill
whistle
,
and
pronounce
some
word
aloud
,
several
time
.
 
<EOS>
what
the
word
be
,
Mr
Pickwick
could
not
distinguish
;
but
he
rather
infer
that
it
must
be
some
nickname
which
distinguish
Mr
Martin
,
from
the
fact
of
a
great
number
of
gentleman
on
the
ground
below
,
immediately
proceed
to
cry
"
Butcher
!
"
<EOS>
in
imitation
of
the
tone
in
which
that
useful
class
of
society
be
will
not
,
diurnally
,
to
make
their
presence
know
at
area
railing
.
   
<EOS>
subsequent
occurrence
confirm
the
accuracy
of
Mr
Pickwick
's
impression
;
for
,
in
a
few
second
,
a
gentleman
,
prematurely
broad
for
his
year
,
clothe
in
a
professional
blue
jean
frock
and
top
-
boot
with
circular
toe
,
enter
the
room
nearly
out
of
breath
,
closely
follow
by
another
gentleman
in
very
shabby
black
,
and
a
sealskin
cap
.
 
<EOS>
the
latter
gentleman
,
who
fasten
his
coat
all
the
way
up
to
his
chin
by
mean
of
a
pin
and
a
button
alternately
,
have
a
very
coarse
red
face
,
and
look
like
a
drunken
chaplain
;
which
,
indeed
,
he
be
.
   
<EOS>
these
two
gentleman
have
by
turn
peruse
Mr
Pickwick
's
billet
,
the
one
express
his
opinion
that
it
be
"
a
rig

and
the
other
his
conviction
that
it
be

a
go

"
 
<EOS>
have
record
their
feeling
in
these
very
intelligible
term
,
they
look
at
Mr
Pickwick
and
each
other
in
awkward
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
an
aggravating
thing
,
just
as
we
get
the
bed
so
snug
,
"
say
the
chaplain
,
look
at
three
dirty
mattress
,
each
roll
up
in
a
blanket
;
which
occupy
one
corner
of
the
room
during
the
day
,
and
form
a
kind
of
slab
,
on
which
be
place
an
old
crack
basin
,
ewer

and
soap

dish
,
of
common
yellow
earthenware
,
with
a
blue
flower
---
"
very
aggravating
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Martin
express
the
same
opinion
in
rather
strong
term
;
Mr
Simpson
,
after
have
let
a
variety
of
expletive
adjective
loose
upon
society
without
any
substantive
to
accompany
them
,
tuck
up
his
sleeve
,
and
begin
to
wash
the
green
for
dinner
.
   
<EOS>
while
this
be
go
on
,
Mr
Pickwick
have
be
eye
the
room
,
which
be
filthily
dirty

and
smell
intolerably
close

<EOS>
there
be
no
vestige
of
either
carpet
,
curtain
,
or
blind
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
even
a
closet
in
it

<EOS>
unquestionably
there
be
but
few
thing
to

if
there
have

<EOS>
however
few

and
mutilated
crockery
,
and

present
somewhat
of
an
uncomfortable
appearance
when

about
the
floor
of
a
small
apartment

which
be
the
common
sitting

sleep
room
of

"
I

the
butcher

after
a
pretty
long
silence

"
what

I

Mr

"
what

We

that
I

Can
I

<EOS>
I

"
   
<EOS>
at
this
inquiry
Mr
Martin
look
,
with
a
countenance
of
excessive
surprise
,
at
his
two
friend
,
and
then
each
gentleman
point
with
his
right
thumb
over
his
left
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
this
action
imperfectly
describe
in
word
by
the
very
feeble
term
of
"
over

"
when
perform

any
number
of
lady

gentleman
who
be
accustomed
to
act
in

have
a
very
graceful
and
airy
effect

its
expression
be
one
of
light
and
playful
sarcasm

<EOS>
"
CAN
you

<EOS>
repeat
Mr
Martin
,
with
a
smile
of
pity
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
if
I
know
as
little
of

as
that

I
would
eat
my
hat

swallow
the
buckle
whole

the
clerical

"
so
would
I

add
the

one
solemnly

<EOS>
after
this
introductory
preface
,
the
three
chum
inform
Mr
Pickwick
,
in
a
breath
,
that
money
be
,
in
the
Fleet
,
<EOS>
just
what
money
be
out
of
it
;
that
it
would
instantly
procure
him
almost
anything
he
desire
;
and
that
,
suppose
he
have
it
,
and
have
no
objection
to
spend
it
,
if
he
only
signify
his
wish

have
a

the
Chancery

long

fortune

and
happiness

and
to
have
acquire
the
right
of
have
a
room
to
himself

<EOS>
as
he
labour
,
however
,
under
the
inconvenience
of
often
want
a
morsel
of
bread
,
he
eagerly
listen
to
Mr
Pickwick
's
proposal
to
rent
the
apartment
,
and
readily
covenant
and
agree
to
yield
him
up
the
sole
and
undisturbed

thereof

in
consideration
of
the
weekly
payment

gaunt

cadaverous
man

in
an
old
greatcoat

slipper

with
sunken

and
a
restless

eager
eye

<EOS>
His

be
bloodless

thin

<EOS>
God

"
<EOS>

Most

We

<EOS>
there

there

there

<EOS>
these

the
Commissioners

<EOS>
It
be
,
and
have

time
out

the
remarkable
fate
of

by
the
general
consent
of
all
the

people
in
London

as

place
of
daily
refuge

<EOS>
It

the

spirit
perpetually
ascend
to
the

be
condense
by
the
heat

there

than

It

the
remote
connection

if
they

it
would
be
no

of

the
singularity

<EOS>
some
of

at
such

the
vapour
of
the
court
be
like
those

<EOS>
a
casual
visitor
may
suppose
this
place
to
be
a
temple
dedicate
to
the
Genius
of
Seediness

there

who

the

<EOS>
They

perhaps
drink

the
most
conspicuous
among

Their

terrible
determination

this
virtuous
resolution

when

violently
into

and
say
(

at

His
success
be

his

quarter
of

or
so
,
as
well
as
any
little
amusement
in
which

could
indulge
.
   
<EOS>
have
arrive
at
this
conclusion
,
he
betake
himself
to
the
tap
.
 
<EOS>
have
purchase
the
beer
,
and
obtain
,
moreover
,
the
day
-
but
-
one

before

,
he
repair
to
the
skittle

ground
,
and
seat
himself
on
a
bench
,
proceed
to
enjoy
himself
in
a
very
sedate
and
methodical
manner
.
   
<EOS>
first
of
all
,
he
take
a
refreshing
draught
of
the
beer
,
and
then
he
look
up
at
a
window
,
and
bestow
a
platonic
wink
on
a
young
lady
who
be
peel
potato
thereat
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
open
the
paper
,
and
fold
it
so
as
to
get
the
police
report
outward
;
and
this
be
a
vexatious
and
difficult
thing
to
do
,
when
there
be
any
wind
stir
,
he
take
another
draught
of
the
beer
when
he
have
accomplish
it
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
he
read
two
line
of
the
paper
,
and
stop
short
to
look
at
a
couple
of

"
in
an
approve
manner
,
and
look
round
upon
the
spectator
,
to
ascertain
whether
their
sentiment
coincide
with
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
this
involve
the
necessity
of
look
up
at
the
window
also
;
and
as
the
young
lady
be
still
there
,
it
be
an
act
of
common
politeness
to
wink
again
,
and
to
drink
to
her
good
health
in
dumb
show
,
in
another
draught
of
the
beer
,
which
Sam
do
;
and
have
frown
hideously
upon
a
small
boy
who
have
note
this

leg
over
the
other
,
and

<EOS>
He
have
hardly

himself
into
the
needful
state
of
abstraction
,
when
he
think
he
hear
his

name
proclaim
in
some
distant
passage
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
he
mistake
,
for
it
quickly
pass
from

to

,
and
in
a
few
second

with
shout
of

bear
some
disparage

be
on
the
point

infinitely
bad

get
on
his

he
could

proceed
to
deliver
an
edifying
discourse
for
the
benefit
of

but
more
especially
of
Mr

whom
he
adjure
in
move
term
to
be
upon
his
guard
in
that
sink
of
iniquity
into
which
he
be
cast
;
to
abstain
from
all
hypocrisy
and
pride
of
heart
;

to
take
in
all

exact
pattern

copy
by
him
(
Stiggins

,
in
which
case
he
may
calculate
on
arrive
,
sooner

later
at
the
comfortable
conclusion
,
that
,
like
him
,
he
be
a
most
estimable
and
blameless
character
,
and
that
all
his
acquaintance
and

be
hopelessly
abandon
and
profligate
wretch

which
consideration
,
he
say
,
could
not

afford
him
the
lively
satisfaction

<EOS>
He
furthermore
conjure
him
to
avoid
,
above
all
thing
,
the
vice
of
intoxication
,
which
he
liken
unto
the
filthy
habit
of
swine
,
and
to
those
poisonous
and
baleful
drug
which
be
chew
in

at
this
point

Mr

without

to
expound
its

doctrine

or
heart

feel
its

principle
,
be
more
dangerous
member
of

impose

worst
informed

cast
scorn

I
can
not

whether
the
wording

cognovit

the
nature
of
the
ostensible
consideration
,
and
the
proof
we
can
get
together
about
the
whole
conduct
of
the
suit
,
will
be
sufficient
to
justify
an
indictment
for
conspiracy
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
not
,
my
dear
Sir

they
be
too
clever
for
that

I
do
mean

however

that
the
whole

you

now
,
my

I
put
it

this
one
hundred

fifty

whatever
it
may

their
verdict
be
wrong

still
they
decide
as
they

right

it
be
against
you

<EOS>
You
have
now
an
opportunity

on
easy
term

of
place
yourself
in
a
much
high
position

you
ever
could

by
remain
here

would
only
be
impute

by
people

yourself

when

it
liberate
your

you
otherwise
doom
to
imprisonment
for
the
whole

your
life

above
all

it
enable

magnanimous
revenge

I

misery

debauchery

which
no

the
infliction

which
on

even
more
frightful

barbarous

I
have
put
these
consideration

very
feebly

Mr

nature
be
a
good

work

by

when

,
dry
her
eye
,
take
to
coax
and
entreat
in
the
sweetest
tone
of
a
very
sweet
voice

he
become
particularly
restless
,
and
evidently
undecide
how
to
act
,
as
be
evince
by
sundry
nervous
rubbing
of
his
spectacle
-
glass
,
nose
,
tight
,
head
,
and
gaiter

<EOS>
take
advantage
of
these
symptom
of
indecision
,
Mr
Perker
(
to
whom
,
it
appear
,
the
young
couple
have
drive
straight
that
morning
)
urge
with
legal
point
and
shrewdness
that
Mr
Winkle
,
senior
,
be
still
unacquainted
with
the
important
rise
in
life
's
flight
of
step
which
his
son
have
take

that
the
future
expectation
of
the
said
son
depend
entirely
upon
the
say
Winkle

senior
,
continue
to
regard
him
with
undiminished
feeling
of
affection
and
attachment
,
which
it
be
very
unlikely
he
would
,
if
this
great
event
be
long
keep
a
secret
from
him
;
that
Mr
Pickwick
,
repair
to
Bristol
to
seek
Mr
Allen
,
may
,
with
equal
reason
,
repair
to
Birmingham
to
seek
Mr
Winkle
,
senior
;
lastly
,
that
Mr
Winkle
,
senior
,
have
good
right
and
title
to
consider
Mr
Pickwick
as
in
some
degree
the
guardian
and
adviser
of
his
son
,
and
that
it
consequently
behove
that
gentleman
,
and
be
indeed
due
to
his
personal
character
,
to
acquaint
the
aforesaid
Winkle
,
senior
,
personally
,
and
by
word
of
mouth
,
with
the
whole
circumstance
of
the
case

and
with
the
share
he
have
take
in
the
transaction

<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
and
Mr
Snodgrass
arrive
,
most
opportunely
,
in
this
stage
of
the
pleading

be
necessary

explain
to

all
that
have
occur

always

so
very
bad
after
all

what

what

must
be
endure

with
various

all
of

but
if
it

all
the

and
they

allow
him

he

for

while

I

on
second

I

if

you
would
have
be

by

in

at

Gentlemen

I
wish
your

mother
have
know
my
uncle
.
<EOS>
They
would
have
be
amazingly
fond
of
him
,
especially
your
respectable
mother
;
I
know
they
would
.
 
<EOS>
if
any
two
of
his
numerous
virtue
predominate
over
the
many
that
adorn
his
character
,
I
should
say
they
be
his
mixed
punch
and
his
after
-
supper
song
.
 
<EOS>
excuse
my
dwelling
on
these
melancholy
recollection
of
depart
worth
<EOS>
;
you
will
not
see
a
man
like
my
uncle
every
day
in
the
week
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
always
consider
it
a
great
point
in
my
uncle
's
character
,
gentleman
,
that
he
be
the
intimate
friend
and
companion
of
Tom
Smart
,
of
the
great
house
of
Bilson
and
Slum
,
Cateaton
Street
,
City
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
collect
for
Tiggin
and
Welps
,
but
for
a
long
time
he
go
pretty
near
the
same
journey
as
Tom
;
and
the
very
first
night
they
meet
,
my
uncle
take
a
fancy
for
Tom
,
and
Tom
take
a
fancy
for
my
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
They
make
a
bet
of
a
new
hat
before
they
have
know
each
other
half
an
hour
,
who
should
brew
the
good
quart
of
punch
and
drink
it
the
quick
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
be
judge
to
have
win
the
making
,
but
Tom
Smart
beat
him
in
the
drinking
by
about
half
a
salt
-
spoonful
.
 
<EOS>
They
take
another
quart
apiece
to
drink
each
other
's
health
in
,
and
be
staunch
friend
ever
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
destiny
in
these
thing
,
gentleman
;
we
can
not
help
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
in
personal
appearance
,
my
uncle
be
a
trifle
short
than
the
middle
size
;
he
be
a
thought
stouter
too
,
than
the
ordinary
run
of
people
,
and
perhaps
his
face
may
be
a
shade
redder
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
the
jolly
face
you
ever
see
,
gentleman
:
something
like
Punch
,
with
a
handsome
nose
and
chin
;
his
eye
be
always
twinkle
and
sparkle
with
good
-
humour
;
and
a
smile
---
not
one
of
your
unmeaning
wooden
grin
,
but
a
real
,
merry
,
hearty
,
good
-
tempered
smile
---
be
perpetually
on
his
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
pitch
out
of
his
gig
once
,
and
knock
,
head
first
,
against
a
milestone
.
 
<EOS>
there
he
lie
,
stunned
,
and
so
cut
about
the
face
with
some
gravel
which
have
be
heap
up
alongside
it
,
that
,
to
use
my
uncle
's
own
strong
expression
,
if
his
mother
could
have
revisit
the
earth
,
she
would
not
have
know
him
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
when
I
come
to
think
of
the
matter
,
gentleman
,
I
feel
pretty
sure
she
would
not
.
 
<EOS>
for
she
die
when
my
uncle
be
two
year
and
seven
month
old
,
and
I
think
it
be
very
likely
that
,
even
without
the
gravel
,
his
top
-
boot
would
have
puzzle
the
good
lady
not
a
little
;
to
say
nothing
of
his
jolly
red
face
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
there
he
lie
,
and
I
have
hear
my
uncle
say
,
many
a
time
,
that
the
man
say
who
pick
him
up
that
he
be
smile
as
merrily
as
if
he
have
tumble
out
for
a
treat
,
and
that
after
they
have
bleed
him
,
the
first
faint
glimmering
of
return
animation
,
be
his
jumping
up
in
bed
,
burst
out
into
a
loud
laugh
,
kiss
the
young
woman
who
hold
the
basin
,
and
demand
a
mutton
chop
and
a
pickle
walnut
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
fond
of
pickled
walnut
,
gentleman
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
always
find
that
,
take
without
vinegar
,
they
relish
the
beer
.

"
My
uncle

great
journey
be
in
the
fall
of
the
leaf

at
which
time
he
collect
debt

take
order

You
be
to

use

any

ever
partook
of
a
real
substantial

Scotch
breakfast

then
go
out

a
slight
lunch

a
bushel

a
dozen

bottled
ale

two

my

neat
this

firmly

himself
,
and

then
a
verse
of

,
and
when
he
be
tired
of
both
,
whistle
melodiously
,
until
he
reach
the
North

which
,
at

connect

<EOS>
here
he
stop
for
a

to
look
at
the
strange

irregular
cluster
of
light
pile
one

and
twinkle
afar
off
so
high

that
they
look
like
star
,
gleam
from
the
castle
wall
on
the
one
side

the
Calton
Hill
on

as
if
they
illuminate
veritable
castle

sleep
heavily
on

in

its

<EOS>
I
say
,
gentleman

my

stop
here
,
for
a

,
to
look
about
him
;

then
,
pay
a
compliment
to
the
weather
,
which
have
a
little
clear
up
,
though
the
moon
be
sink
,
walk
on
again
,
as
royally
as
before
;
keep
the
middle
of
the
road
with
great
dignity
,
and
look
as
if
he
would
very
much
like
to
meet
with
somebody
who
would
dispute
possession
of
it
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nobody
at
all
dispose
to
contest
the
point
,
as
it
happen
;
and
so
,
on
he
go

with
his
thumb

find

sit
himself
quietly
down

They

from

He

and
shoe

ruffle
at
his
wrist
,
a

corner

and
a
long

<EOS>
the
flap
of
his
waist

coat
come
half

way
down
his
thigh
,
and
the
end
of
his
cravat
reach
to
his
waist
.
 
<EOS>
He
stalk
gravely
to
the
coach
door
,
pull
off
his
hat
,
and
hold
it
above
his
head
at
arm
's
length
,
cock
his
little
finger
in
the
air
at
the
same
time
,
as
some
affect
people
do
,
when
they
take
a
cup
of
tea
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
draw
his
foot
together
,
and
make
a
low
,
grave
bow
,
and
then
put
out
his
left
hand
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
be
just
go
to
step
forward
,
and
shake
it
heartily
,
when
he
perceive
that
these
attention
be
direct
,
not
towards
him
,
but
to
a
young
lady
who
just
then
appear
at
the
foot
of
the
step
,
attire
in
an
old
-
fashioned
green
velvet
dress
with
a
long
waist
and
stomacher
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
no
bonnet
on
her
head
,
gentleman
,
which
be
muffle
in
a
black
silk
hood
,
but
she
look
round
for
an
instant
as
she
prepare
to
get
into
the
coach
,
and
such
a
beautiful
face
as
she
disclose
,
my
uncle
have
never

---
not
even
in
a
picture
.
 
<EOS>
She
get
into
the
coach
,
hold
up
her
dress
with
one
hand
;
and
as
my
uncle
always
say
with
a
round
oath
,
when
he
tell
the
story
,
he
would
not
have
believe
it
possible
that
leg
and
foot
could
have
be
bring
to
such
a
state
of
perfection
unless
he
have
see
them
with
his
own
eye
.
   
<EOS>
"
but
,
in
this
one
glimpse
of
the
beautiful
face
,
my
uncle
see
that
the
young
lady
cast
an
imploring
look
upon
him
,
and
that
she
appear
terrified
and
distressed
.
 
<EOS>
He
notice
,
too
,
that
the
young
fellow
in
the
powdered
wig
,
notwithstanding
his
show
of
gallantry
,
which
be
all
very
fine
and
grand
,
clasp
her
tight
by
the
wrist
when
she
get
in

and
follow
himself
immediately
afterwards

<EOS>
an
uncommonly
ill

a
very
large

,
and
boot
up
to
his
hip

belong
to
the
party
;
and
when
he
sit
himself
down
next
to
the
young
lady
,
who
shrink
into
a
corner
at
his
approach
,
my
uncle
be
confirm
in
his
original
impression
that
something
dark
and
mysterious
be
go
forward
,
or
,
as
he
always
say
himself
,
that
"
there
be
a
screw
loose
somewhere
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
quite
surprising
how
quickly
he
make
up
his
mind
to
help
the
lady
at
any
peril
,
if
she
need
any
help
.
   
<EOS>

<EOS>
with
this
,
he
whip
his

out
,
and
make
a
lunge
at
my
uncle
without
further
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
My

with
great
dexterity
he
snatch
the
ill

from
his

,
and
,
receive

it
tight

in

do
not

<EOS>

as
my

use
to

with
a
smile

away

My
uncle
peep
out
of
the
coach
window
as
they
emerge
from
the
yard
,
and
observe
that
the

guard

horse

complete

be
drive
round

round
in
circle

at

trot
of
about
five
mile
an
hour

<EOS>
My

burn
with
indignation
,
gentleman

<EOS>
as
a
commercial
man
,
he
feel
that
the
mail
-
bag
be
not
to
be
trifle
with
,
and
he
resolve
to
memorialise
the
Post
Office
on
the
subject
,
the
very
instant
he
reach
London
.
   
<EOS>
"
at
present
,
however
,
his
thought
be
occupy
with
the
young
lady
who
sit
in
the
farth
corner
of
the
coach
,
with
her
face
muffle
closely
in
her
hood

the
gentleman
with
the
sky

blue
coat

opposite
to
her
;
the
other
man
in
the
plum

coloured
suit

by

both
watch
her
intently
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
so
much
as
rustle
the
fold
of
her
hood
,
he
could
hear
the
ill
-
looking
man
clap
his
hand
upon
his
sword
,
and
could
tell
by
the
other
's
breathing
(
it
be
so
dark
he
could
not
see
his
face
)
that
he
be
look
as
big

to
devour
her
at

<EOS>
this
rouse
my
uncle
more
and
more
,
and
he
resolve
,
come
what
may
,
to
see
the
end
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
great
admiration
for
bright
eye
,
and
sweet
face
,
and
pretty
leg
and
foot
;
in
short
,
he
be
fond
of
the
whole
sex

<EOS>
It
run
in
our
family

gentleman

so
be
I.
   
<EOS>
"
many
be
the
device
which
my
uncle
practise
,
to
attract
the
lady
's
attention
,
or
at
all
event
,
to
engage
the
mysterious
gentleman
in
conversation

<EOS>
They
be
all
in
vain
;
the
gentleman
would
not
talk

the
lady
do
not
dare

<EOS>
He
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
coach
window
at
interval
,
and
bawl
out
to
know
why
they
do
not
go
faster

he
call
till
he
be
hoarse
;
nobody
pay
the

attention
to
him

<EOS>
He
lean
back
in
the
coach
,
and
think
of
the
beautiful
face
,
and
the
foot
and
leg
.
 
<EOS>
this
answer
better
;
it
while
away
the
time
,
and
keep
him
from
wonder
where
he
be
go
,
and
how
it
be
that
he
find
himself
in
such
an
odd
situation
.
 
<EOS>
not
that
this
would
have
worry
him
much
,
anyway

he

mighty
free

My

look
at
the
guard
for
a
few
second

in
some
doubt
whether
it
would
not
be
well
to
wrench
his
blunderbuss
from
him

fire
it
in

<EOS>
the
impression

accurate

the
end
of
the
walking

be
batter

in

of
his

I

be
good
to

it
in

with
the
open

in
ridicule

derision
of
his

fix
his
eye
on

with
an
intensity

every
inch
of
the

be
walk
over
with
similar
perseverance
;
the

out

often
enough

justify
the
imposition

all

at

Mr

when
noon
have
arrive

without

rang
the
bell
resolutely

down
harder

that
the
discomfort

still
there
be
something
in
the
motion

the
sense
of
be
up

do
,
which
be
so
infinitely
superior
to
be
pen
in

,
look
at
the
dull
rain
drip
into
a
dull
street
,
that
they
all
agree
,
on

,
that
the
change
be
a
great
improvement

how

possibly
have
delay
make
it
as
long

when

<EOS>
I
think
it
a

good
time
to

something
serious

it

They

it
such

more
dreadful

there
should

nothing

pray
go
on

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
could
spin
out
a
story
,
"
say
Wardle
abruptly
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
come
out
,
sooner
or
later
,
and
it
will
save
us
all
a
great
deal
of
time
if
it
come
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
be
,
then
,
that
Bella
at
last
muster
up
courage
to
tell
me
that
Emily
be
very
unhappy
;
that
she
and
your
young
friend
Snodgrass
have
be
in
constant
correspondence
and
communication
ever
since
last
Christmas
;
that
she
have
very
dutifully
make
up
her
mind
to
run
away
with
him
,
in
laudable
imitation
of
her
old
friend
and
school
-
fellow
;
but
that
have
some
compunction
of
conscience
on
the
subject
,
inasmuch
as
I
have
always
be
rather
kindly
disposed
to
both
of
them
,
they
have
think
it
better
in
the
first
instance
to
pay
me
the
compliment
of
ask
whether
I
would
have
any
objection
to
their
be
marry
in
the
usual
matter

of
-
fact
manner

<EOS>
there
now
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
if
you
can
make
it
convenient
to
reduce
your
eye
to
their
usual
size
again
,
and
to
let
me
hear
what
you
think
we
ought
to
do
,
I
shall
feel
rather
obliged
to
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
the
testy
manner
in
which
the
hearty
old
gentleman
utter
this
last
sentence
be
not
wholly
unwarranted
;
for
Mr
Pickwick
's
face
have
settle
down
into
an
expression
of
blank
amazement
and
perplexity
,
quite
curious
to
behold
.
   
<EOS>
"
snodgrass!-since

last
Christmas

the

broken

gentleman

<EOS>
since

Christmas

wardle
<EOS>
;
"
that
be
plain
enough

very
bad
spectacle
we
must
have
wear

<EOS>
"
I
do
not

Mr

ruminate
;

I
can
not

"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
easy
enough
to

it

the
choleric
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
have
be
a
young
man
,
you
would
have
be
in
the
secret
long
ago

"
add
Wardle
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
"
the
truth
be
,
that
,
know
nothing
of
this
matter
,
I
have
rather
press
Emily
for
four
or
five
month
past
,
to
receive
favourably
(
if
she
could
;
I
would
never
attempt
to
force
a
girl
's
inclination
)
<EOS>
the
address
of
a
young
gentleman
down
in
our
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
that
,
girl
-
like
,
to
enhance
her
own
value
and
increase
the
ardour
of
Mr
Snodgrass
,
she
have
represent
this

in
very
glowing
colour

that
they
have
both
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
they
be
a
terribly
-
persecute
pair
of
unfortunate
,
and
have
no
resource

clandestine
matrimony
,
or
charcoal

<EOS>
now
the
question
be
,
what
be
to
be
do
?

<EOS>
"
what
have
you
do
?

this
?

I
make
a

just

interpose
Perker

who
have
accompany
this
dialogue
with
sundry
twitching
of
his

vindictive
rubbing

other
symptom

that

very
natural

how
?

<EOS>
"
I
go
into
a
great
passion

frighten
my

fit

<EOS>

that
be
judicious
,

what
else
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
fret

fume
all

<EOS>
"
at
last
I
get
tired

unpleasant

I
hire
a

,
put

look
from

well
then

rise

my
advice
be
,
that
you
both
walk
away
together
,

ride
away
,
or
get
away
by
some
mean
or
other

I

to
do

<EOS>

I

you
both

great

you

yourself

<EOS>
You
have
settle
it
already
,
to
all
intent
and
purpose

<EOS>
thus
express
himself
,
the
little
gentleman
poke
his
snuff

box
first
into
the
chest
of
Mr

in
common
humanity
have
a
dickey
behind
for
the
fat
boy
,
who
,
if
there
have
be
a
footboard
instead

would
have
roll
off
and
kill
himself
in
his
very
first
nap

<EOS>
drive
to
the
George
and
Vulture
,
they
find
that
Arabella

her
maid
have
send
for
a
hackney

coach
immediately
on
the
receipt
of
a
short
note
from
Emily
announce
her
arrival
in

proceed
straight
to

Adelphi

business
to

to

return
together

at
five
o'clock

charge
with
this
message

the
fat
boy
return
,
slumber
as
peaceably
in
his
dickey
,
over
the
stone
,
as
if
it
have
be
a
down
bed
on
watch
spring

<EOS>
by
some
extraordinary
miracle
he
awake
of
his
own
accord
,
when
the
coach
stop
,
and
give
himself
a
good
shake
to
stir
up
his
faculty

go
upstairs
to
execute
his
commission

now
,
whether

jumble
the

faculty
together

instead

have
rouse
such
a
quantity

new

within
him
as
to
render

oblivious

(
which
be
also
possible
)
have
prove
unsuccessful
in
prevent
his
fall
asleep
as
he
ascend
the
stair
,
it
be
an
undoubted
fact
that
he
walk
into
the
sit

room
without
previously
knock
at

so
beheld
a
gentleman
with

look
out

at

this
phenomenon

the
fat

utter
an
interjection

the
lady
a
scream

an
oath
,
almost
simultaneously

"

slow

look
rather
puzzled
at
first
to
account
for
this
sudden
prepossession
in
his
favour

stare
about

in
a
very
alarming
manner

<EOS>
at
length
his
broad
face
begin
to
show
symptom
of
a
grin
of
proportionately
broad
dimension
;
and
then
,
thrust
half

a

crown
into
each
of
his
pocket
,
and
a
hand
and
wrist
after
it

into
a
horse

stretch
out
his

ravish
a
kiss

agility
to
elude
him
,
his
fair

have
vanish
before

again
;
upon
which
the
apathetic
youth

a
pound

so
of

fall
fast
asleep

<EOS>
there

He

pass
thence
into
an
inner
apartment
(
Mr

these

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
very
lucky
I
have
the
presence
of
mind
to
avoid
them

"
think
Mr

with
a
smile
,
and
walk
on
tiptoe
to
another
door
near
the
bedside
;
"
this
open
into
the
same
passage
,
and
I
can
walk
quietly
and
comfortably
away

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
there
be
only
one
obstacle
to
his
walking
quietly
and
comfortably
away
,
which
be
that
the
door
be
lock

the
key
gone

<EOS>
"

devoutly

Mr

He
venture
once
to
whisper

through

the
probability
of
the
wrong
waiter
come
to
his
relief
,
flash
upon
his
mind
,
together
with
a
sense
of
the
strong
resemblance
between
his
own
situation
and
that
in
which
another
gentleman
have
be
recently
find
in
a
neighbour
hotel
(

<EOS>
"

well

have
just
leave
a
pleasant
little
smoking

party
of
twelve
medical

in
a
small
back

again

Ben

dear
,
because
you
tumble
me
so

<EOS>
"
   
at
this
point
of
the
reconciliation
,
Mr
Ben
Allen
allow
his
feeling
and
the
cigar
and
porter
to
overcome
him
,
and
look
round
upon
the

damp
spectacle

in

tone

I
be
afraid

aloud

Joe
;
why

damn
the

<EOS>
to
the
great
distress
of
his
master
,
the
fat
boy
be
indeed
in
a
state
of
remarkable
vigilance
,
his
eye
be
wide
open
,
and
look
as
if
they
intend
to
remain
so
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
alacrity
in
his
manner
,
too
,
which
be
equally
unaccountable
;
every
time
his
eye
meet
those
of
Emily

Arabella

he
smirk
and
grin
;
once
,
Wardle
could
have
swear
,
he
see
him
wink
.
   
<EOS>
this
alteration
in
the
fat

demeanour
originate
in
his
increase
sense
of
his
own
importance

the
dignity
he
acquire
from
have
be
take
into
the
confidence
of
the
young
lady
;
and
the
smirks
,
and
grin
,
and
winks
be
so
many
condescending
assurance
that
they
may
depend
upon
his
fidelity
.
 
<EOS>
as
these
token
be
rather
calculate
to
awaken
suspicion
than
allay
it
,
and
be
somewhat
embarrassing
besides
,
they
be
occasionally
answer
by
a
frown
or
shake
of
the
head
from
Arabella
,
which
the
fat
boy
,
consider
as
hint
to
be
on
his
guard

express
his

by
smirk

conclusion

"
<EOS>
just
keep

the

have
implore

a
private
appeal

,
be
inform
thereof
through
Mr

,
lest
the
news
should
be
too
much
for

but
it
be
not

a
wise
and
discreet
doctor
,
and
know
what
be
good
for
himself
,
as
well
as
for

say
that
perhaps
if
Mrs
Trundle
stop
at
home
,
she
may
hurt
herself
more
by
fret
,
than
by
go
,
so
perhaps
she
have
better
go
.

and
she
do
go
;
