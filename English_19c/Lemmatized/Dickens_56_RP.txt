I

such

have
come

I

never
have
be

Their
way
be
by
a
rugged

precipitous

they

for
the
party

arrive
at

bourne

the
horror
of

way

Famine

the
unrelateable
experience
through
which
he
have
pass
have
be
so
tremendous

that
he
be
not
hang

he
may
be

go
back
to
his
old
chain

time

he
tempt
one
other
prisoner
away

seize
another

once
more

necessarily
in

Mr

at

crisis

offer
to

the
good
advice

he
recommend
that
all
should
come
to

low

<EOS>
"
in
this
charitable
work
of
comfort

Mr

now
join
,
by
assurance
of
his
opinion

that
,
the
ship
would
hold
together
till
the
morning
,
when
all
would
be
safe

<EOS>
Captain

observe
one
of
the
young

loud
in
his
exclamation

terror

frequently
cry
that

cheerfully

him
be
quiet

remark
that

would
be
safe

"
It
be
difficult
to
convey
a
correct
idea
of
the
scene
of
this
deplorable
catastrophe

without
describe
the
place
where
it
happen

<EOS>
the
Haleswell
strike
on
the
rock
at
a
part
of

shore
where
the
cliff
be
of
vast
height

rise
almost
perpendicular
from
its
base

<EOS>
but
at
this
particular
spot
,
the
foot
of
the
cliff
be
excavate
into
a
cavern
of
ten
or
twelve
yard
in
depth
,
and
of
breadth
equal
to
the
length
of
a
large
ship

<EOS>
the
side
of
the
cavern
be
so
nearly
upright
,
as
to
be
of
extremely
difficult
access
;
and
the
bottom
be
strew
with
sharp
and
uneven
rock
,
which
seem
,
by
some
convulsion
of
the
earth
,
to
have
be
detach
from
its
roof

the
ship
lie
with
her
broadside
opposite
to
the
mouth
of
this
cavern

with
her
whole
length
stretch
almost
from
side
to
side
of
it

<EOS>
but
when
she
strike
,
it
be
too
dark
for
the
unfortunate
person
on
board
to
discover
the
real
magnitude
of
the
danger
,
and
the
extreme
horror
of
such
a
situation

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in

but
on
Mr

return

company

he
perceive
a
considerable
alteration

appearance

the
side

visibly
give
way
;
the
deck
seem
to
be
lift

and
he
discover
other
strong
indication
that
she
could
not
hold
much
longer
together

<EOS>
on
this
account
,
he
attempt
to
go
forward
to
look
out
,
but
immediately
see
that
the
ship
have
separate
in
the
middle
,
and
that
the
forepart
have
change
its
position
,
lie
rather
further
out
towards
the
sea

in
such
an
emergency

when
the
next
moment
may
plunge
him
into
eternity

he
determine
to
seize
the
present
opportunity
,
and
follow
the
example
of
the
crew
and
the
soldier

who
be
now
quit
the
ship
in
number
,
and
make
their
way
to
the
shore
,
though
quite
ignorant
of
its
nature
and
description

"
among
other
expedient

the
ensign

staff
have
be
unshipped
,
and
attempt
to
be
lay
between
the

side

some
of

rock

without
success
,
for
it
snap
asunder
before
it
reach
them

however
,
by
the
light
of
a
lanthorn
,
which
a
seaman
hand
through
the
skylight
of
the
round

house
to
the
deck

Mr

discover
a
spar
which
appear
to
be
lay
from

side
to
the
rock

on
this
spar
he
resolve
to
attempt
his
escape

<EOS>
"
accordingly
,
lie
down
upon
it
,
he
thrust
himself
forward
;
however
,
he
soon
find
that
it
have
no
communication
with
the
rock

he
reach
the
end
of
it
,
and
then
slip
off
,
receive
a
very
violent
bruise
in
his
fall
,

before
he
could
recover
his
leg
,
he
be
wash
off
by
the
surge

He
now
support
himself
by
swim
,
until
a
return
wave
dash
him
against
the
back
part
of

here
he
lay
hold
of

projection
in
the
rock

be
so
much
benumb
that
he
be
on
the
point

quit
it

already
gain
a
footing

extend
his
hand
,

assist
him
until

could
secure
himself

as
I
recall
the
dispersal

disappearance

nearly
all
the
participator
in
this
once
famous
shipwreck

a

being
recover

the

be
long

revive
from

the
Cape

of
a
white
woman

have
be
see
weep
outside
a
savage
hut
far

whisperingly
associate

the
remembrance
of
the
miss

be
often
seek

another
kind
of
travel
come
into
my

<EOS>
thought

a
voyager
unexpectedly
summon
from
home
,
who
travel
a
vast
distance
,
and
could
never
return

<EOS>
thought
of
this
unhappy
wayfarer
in
the
depth
of
his
sorrow
,
in
the
bitterness
of
his
anguish
,
in
the
helplessness
of
his
self

reproach
,
in
the
desperation
of
his
desire
to
set
right
what
he
have
leave
wrong
,
and
do
what
he
have
leave
undone
.
   
<EOS>
for

there

many

many
thing
he
have
neglect

<EOS>
little
matter

thing

an
immeasurable
distance

there
be
many
many
blessing

inadequately

there

trivial
injury

not
forgive
,
there
be
love
that
he
have
but
poorly
return
,
there
be
friendship
that
he
have
too
lightly
prize
:
there
be
a
million
kind
word
that
he
may
have
speak
,
a
million
kind
look
that
he
may
have
give
,
uncountable
slight
easy
deed
in
which
he
may
have
be
most
truly
great

good

o

for

one

out

where
I

a

he
have

from
immense

when
I

out
of
England

<EOS>
He
have
fall
sick
;
he
have
die

again

again
depart

He

want
a

to

a

him
up
in

for
ever
;
a

to
take
him
to
the

;
a

him
into

He
have
frequently

exactly
seven

;
who
have
never
change
in
the
least
degree
through
fourteen
long
revolving
year
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
his
wife
,
what
that
suffer
woman
have
undergo
,
nobody
know
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
always
be
in
an
interesting
situation
through
the
same
long
period
,
and
have
never
be
confine
yet
.
 
<EOS>
His
devotion
to
her
have
be
uncease
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
never
care
for
himself
;
he
could
have
perish
---
he
would
rather
,
in
short
---
but
be
it
not
his
christian
duty
as
a
man
,
a
husband
,
and
a
father
,
---
to
write
beg
letter
when
he
look
at
her
?
<EOS>
(
He
have
usually
remark
that
he
would
call
in
the
evening
for
an
answer
to
this
question
.
)
   
<EOS>
He
have
be
the
sport
of
the
strange
misfortune
.
 
<EOS>
what
his
brother
have
do
to
him
would
have
break
anybody
else
's
heart
.
<EOS>
His
brother
go
into
business
with
him
,
and
run
away
with
the
money
;
his
brother
get
him
to
be
security
for
an
immense
sum
and
leave
him
to
pay
it
;
his
brother
would
have
give
him
employment
to
the
tune
of
hundred
a
-
year
,
if
he
would
have
consent
to
write
letter
on
a
Sunday
;
his
brother
enunciate
principle
incompatible
with
his
religious
view
,
and
he
could
not
(
in
consequence
)
permit
his
brother
to
provide
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
landlord
have
never
show
a
spark
of
human
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
put
in
that
execution
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
,
but
he
have
never
take
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
the
broker
's
man
have
grow
grey
in
possession
.
 
<EOS>
They
will
have
to
bury
him
some
day
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
be
attach
to
every
conceivable
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
in
the
army
,
in
the
navy
,
in
the
church
,
in
the
law
;
connect
with
the
press
,
the
fine
art
,
public
institution
,
every
description
and
grade
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
bring
up
as
a
gentleman
;
he
have
be
at
every
college
in
Oxford
and
Cambridge
;
he
can
quote
Latin
in
his
letter
(
but
generally
misspell
some
minor
english
word
)
;
he
can
tell
you
what
Shakespeare
say
about
beg
,
well
than
you
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
observe
,
that
in
the
midst
of
his
affliction
he
always
read
the
newspaper
;
and
round
off
his
appeal
with
some
allusion
,
that
may
be
suppose
to
be
in
my
way
,
to
the
popular
subject
of
the
hour
.
   
<EOS>
His
life
present
a
series
of
inconsistency
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
he
have
never
write
such
a
letter
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
blush
with
shame
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
first
time
;
that
shall
be
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
answer
it
,
and
let
it
be
understand
that
,
then
,
he
will
kill
himself
quietly
.
<EOS>
sometimes
(
and
more
frequently
)
he
have
write
a
few
such
letter
.
<EOS>
then
he
enclose
the
answer
,
with
an
intimation
that
they
be
of
inestimable
value
to
him
,
and
a
request
that
they
may
be
carefully
return
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
fond
of
enclose
something
---
verse
,
letter
,
pawnbroker
'
duplicate
,
anything
to
necessitate
an
answer
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
severe
upon
"
the
pampered
minion
of
fortune
,
"
who
refuse
him
the
half
-
sovereign
refer
to
in
the
enclosure
number
two
---
but
he
know
me
better
.
   
<EOS>
He
write
in
a
variety
of
style
;
sometimes
in
low
spirit
;
sometimes
quite
jocosely
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
in
low
spirit
he
write
down
-
hill
and
repeat
word
---
these
little
indication
be
expressive
of
the
perturbation
of
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
more
vivacious
,
he
be
frank
with
me
;
he
be
quite
the
agreeable
rattle
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
human
nature
be
,
---
who
better
?
 
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
little
money
once
,
and
he
run
through
it
---
as
many
man
have
do
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
find
his
old
friend
turn
away
from
him
now
---
many
man
have
do
that
before
him
too
!
 
<EOS>
Shall
he
tell
me
why
he
write
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
because
he
have
no
kind
of
claim
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
it
on
that
ground
plainly
;
and
beg
to
ask
for
the
loan
(
as
I
know
human
nature
)
of
two
sovereign
,
to
be
repay
next
Tuesday
six
week
,
before
twelve
at
noon
.
   
<EOS>
sometimes
,
when
he
be
sure
that
I
have
find
him
out
,
and
that
there
be
no
chance
of
money
,
he
write
to
inform
me
that
I
have
get
rid
of
him
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
enlist
into
the
company
's
service
,
and
be
off
directly
---
but
he
want
a
cheese
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
inform
by
the
serjeant
that
it
be
essential
to
his
prospect
in
the
regiment
that
he
should
take
out
a
single
Gloucester
cheese
,
weigh
from
twelve
to
fifteen
pound
.
 
<EOS>
eight
or
nine
shilling
would
buy
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
ask
for
money
,
after
what
have
pass
;
but
if
he
call
at
nine
,
to
-
morrow
morning
<EOS>
may
he
hope
to
find
a
cheese
?
 
<EOS>
and
be
there
anything
he
can
do
to
show
his
gratitude
in
Bengal
?
   
<EOS>
once
he
write
me
rather
a
special
letter
,
propose
relief
in
kind
.
<EOS>
He
have
get
into
a
little
trouble
by
leave
parcel
of
mud
do
up
in
brown
paper
,
at
people
's
house
,
on
pretence
of
be
a
Railway
-
Porter
,
in
which
character
he
receive
carriage
money
.
 
<EOS>
this
sportive
fancy
he
expiate
in
the
House
of
Correction
.
 
<EOS>
not
long
after
his
release
,
and
on
a
Sunday
morning
,
he
call
with
a
letter
(
have
first
dust
himself
all
over
)
,
in
which
he
give
me
to
understand
that
,
be
resolve
to
earn
an
honest
livelihood
,
he
have
be
travel
about
the
country
with
a
cart
of
crockery
.
<EOS>
that
he
have
be
do
pretty
well
until
the
day
before
,
when
his
horse
have
drop
down
dead
near
Chatham
,
in
Kent
.
 
<EOS>
that
this
have
reduce
him
to
the
unpleasant
necessity
of
get
into
the
shaft
himself
,
and
draw
the
cart
of
crockery
to
London
---
a
somewhat
exhausting
pull
of
thirty
mile
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
do
not
venture
to
ask
again
for
money
;
but
that
if
I
would
have
the
goodness
to
leave
him
out
a
donkey
,
he
would
call
for
the
animal
before
breakfast
!
   
<EOS>
at
another
time
my
friend
(
I
be
describe
actual
experience
)
introduce
himself
as
a
literary
gentleman
in
the
last
extremity
of
distress
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
have
a
play
accept
at
a
certain
Theatre
---
which
be
really
open
;
its
representation
be
delay
by
the
indisposition
of
a
lead
actor
---
who
be
really
ill
;
and
he
and
his
be
in
a
state
of
absolute
starvation
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
make
his
necessity
know
to
the
Manager
of
the
Theatre
,
he
put
it
to
me
to
say
what
kind
of
treatment
he
may
expect
?
 
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
we
get
over
that
difficulty
to
our
mutual
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
a
little
while
afterwards
he
be
in
some
other
strait
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
Mrs
Southcote
,
his
wife
,
be
in
extremity
---
and
we
adjust
that
point
too
.
 
<EOS>
a
little
while
afterwards
he
have
take
a
new
house
,
and
be
go
headlong
to
ruin
for
want
of
a
water
-
butt
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
my
misgiving
about
the
water
-
butt
,
and
do
not
reply
to
that
epistle
.
 
<EOS>
but
a
little
while
afterwards
,
I
have
reason
to
feel
penitent
for
my
neglect
.
 
<EOS>
He
write
me
a
few
break
-
hearted
line
,
inform
me
that
the
dear
partner
of
his
sorrow
die
in
his
arm
last
night
at
nine
o'clock
!
   
<EOS>
I
despatch
a
trusty
messenger
to
comfort
the
bereave
mourner
and
his
poor
child
;
but
the
messenger
go
so
soon
,
that
the
play
be
not
ready
to
be
play
out
;
my
friend
be
not
at
home
,
and
his
wife
be
in
a
most
delightful
state
of
health
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
take
up
by
the
Mendicity
Society
(
informally
it
afterwards
appear
)
,
and
I
present
myself
at
a
London
Police
-
Office
with
my
testimony
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
Magistrate
be
wonderfully
strike
by
his
educational
acquirement
,
deeply
impressed
by
the
excellence
of
his
letter
,
exceedingly
sorry
to
see
a
man
of
his
attainment
there
,
compliment
him
highly
on
his
power
of
composition
,
and
be
quite
charm
to
have
the
agreeable
duty
of
discharge
him
.
 
<EOS>
a
collection
be
make
for
the
"
poor
fellow
,
"
as
he
be
call
in
the
report
,
and
I
leave
the
court
with
a
comfortable
sense
of
be
universally
regard
as
a
sort
of
monster
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
come
to
me
a
friend
of
mine
,
the
governor
of
a
large
prison
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
ever
go
to
the
Police
-
Office
against
that
man
,
"
say
he
,
"
without
come
to
me
first
?
 
<EOS>
I
know
all
about
him
and
his
fraud
.
 
<EOS>
He
lodge
in
the
house
of
one
of
my
warder
,
at
the
very
time
when
he
first
write
to
you
;
and
then
he
be
eat
spring
-
lamb
at
eighteen
-
pence
a
pound
,
and
early
asparagus
at
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
much
a
bundle
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
on
that
very
same
day
,
and
in
that
very
same
hour
,
my
injure
gentleman
write
a
solemn
address
to
me
,
demand
to
know
what
compensation
I
propose
to
make
him
for
his
have
pass
the
night
in
a
"
loathsome
dungeon
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
next
morning
an
irish
gentleman
,
a
member
of
the
same
fraternity
,
who
have
read
the
case
,
and
be
very
well
persuade
<EOS>
I
should
be
chary
of
go
to
that
Police
-
Office
again
,
positively
refuse
to
leave
my
door
for
less
than
a
sovereign
,
and
,
resolve
to
besiege
me
into
compliance
,
literally
"
sit
down
"
before
it
for
ten
mortal
hour
.
 
<EOS>
the
garrison
be
well
provision
,
I
remain
within
the
wall
;
and
he
raise
the
siege
at
midnight
with
a
prodigious
alarum
on
the
bell
.
   
<EOS>
the
Begging
-
Letter
Writer
often
have
an
extensive
circle
of
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
whole
page
of
the
"
Court
Guide
"
be
ready
to
be
reference
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
Noblemen
and
gentleman
write
to
say
there
never
be
such
a
man
for
probity
and
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
know
him
time
out
of
mind
,
and
there
be
nothing
they
would
not
do
for
him
.
<EOS>
somehow
,
they
do
not
give
him
that
one
pound
ten
<EOS>
he
stand
in
need
of
;
but
perhaps
it
be
not
enough
---
they
want
to
do
more
,
and
his
modesty
will
not
allow
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
remark
of
his
trade
that
it
be
a
very
fascinating
one
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
leave
it
;
and
those
who
be
near
to
him
become
smitten
with
a
love
of
it
,
too
,
and
sooner
or
later
set
up
for
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
He
employ
a
messenger
---
man
,
woman
,
or
child
.
 
<EOS>
that
messenger
be
certain
ultimately
to
become
an
independent
Begging
-
Letter
Writer
.
 
<EOS>
His
son
and
daughter
succeed
to
his
calling
,
and
write
begging
-
letter
when
he
be
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
throw
off
the
infection
of
begging
-
letter
writing
,
like
the
contagion
of
disease
.
 
<EOS>
what
Sydney
Smith
so
happily
call
"
the
dangerous
luxury
of
dishonesty
"
be
more
tempting
,
and
more
catching
,
it
would
seem
,
in
this
instance
than
in
any
other
.
   
<EOS>
He
always
belong
to
a
Corresponding
-
society
of
Begging
-
Letter
Writers
.
 
<EOS>
any
one
who
will
,
may
ascertain
this
fact
.
 
<EOS>
give
money
to
-
day
in
recognition
of
a
begging
-
letter
,
---
no
matter
how
unlike
a
common
begging
-
letter
,
---
and
for
the
next
fortnight
you
will
have
a
rush
of
such
communication
.
 
<EOS>
steadily
refuse
to
give
;
and
the
beg
-
letter
become
Angels
'
visit
,
until
the
Society
be
from
some
cause
or
other
in
a
dull
way
of
business
,
and
may
as
well
try
you
as
anybody
else
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
of
little
use
inquire
into
the
Begging
-
Letter
Writer
's
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
be
sometimes
accidentally
find
out
,
as
in
the
case
already
mention
(
though
that
be
not
the
first
inquiry
make
)
;
but
apparent
misery
be
always
a
part
of
his
trade
,
and
real
misery
very
often
be
,
in
the
interval
of
spring
-
lamb
and
early
asparagus
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
naturally
an
incident
of
his
dissipated
and
dishonest
life
.
   
<EOS>
that
the
calling
be
a
successful
one
,
and
that
large
sum
of
money
be
gain
by
it
,
must
be
evident
to
anybody
who
read
the
Police
report
of
such
case
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
prosecution
be
of
rare
occurrence
,
relatively
to
the
extent
to
which
the
trade
be
carry
on
.
 
<EOS>
the
cause
of
this
be
to
be
find
(
as
no
one
know
well
than
the
Begging
-
Letter
Writer
,
for
it
be
a
part
of
his
speculation
)
in
the
aversion
people
feel
to
exhibit
themselves
as
have
be
impose
upon
,
or
as
have
weakly
gratify
their
conscience
with
a
lazy
,
flimsy
substitute
for
the
noblest
of
all
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
man
at
large
,
at
the
moment
when
this
paper
be
prepare
for
the
press
(
on
the
29th
of
April
,
1850
)
,
and
never
once
take
up
yet
,
who
,
within
these
twelvemonth
,
have
be
probably
the
most
audacious
and
the
most
successful
swindler
that
even
this
trade
have
ever
know
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
something
singularly
base
in
this
fellow
's
proceeding
;
it
have
be
his
business
to
write
to
all
sort
and
condition
of
people
,
in
the
name
of
person
of
high
reputation
and
unblemished
honour
,
profess
to
be
in
distress
---
the
general
admiration
and
respect
for
whom
have
ensure
a
ready
and
generous
reply
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
in
the
hope
that
the
result
of
the
real
experience
of
a
real
person
may
do
something
more
to
induce
reflection
on
this
subject
than
any
abstract

His

<EOS>
long

<EOS>
whatever

one

within

<EOS>
the

make
it
perfectly
manifest
that
a
set
of
lazy
vagabond

between
the
general
desire
to
do
something
to
relieve
the
sickness
and
misery
under
which
the
poor
be
suffer
,
and
the
suffering
poor
themselves

<EOS>
that
many
who
seek
to
do
some
little
to
repair
the
social
wrong
,
inflict
in
the
way
of
preventible
sickness
and
death
upon

one
of
these

his
life
of
punishment
in

compare
it
with
the
life
of
one
of
these

stricken
alley
,
or
one
of
the

a
grim

<EOS>
that
the
crowning
miracle
of
all
the
miracle
sum
up
in
the
New
Testament
,
after
the
miracle
of
the
blind
seeing
,
and
the
lame
walking
,
and
the
restoration
of
the
dead
to
life
,
be
the
miracle
that
the
poor
have
the
Gospel
preach
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
that
while
the
poor
be
unnaturally
and
unnecessarily
cut
off
by
the
thousand
,
in
the
prematurity
of
their
age
,
or
in
the
rottenness
of
their
youth
---
for

such

in
hollow

<EOS>
that
of
all

this
be
the

<EOS>
and
that

give
to
a

Writer
for
the
quieting
of
an
uneasy
breast
,
would
be
presentable
on

Great

<EOS>
the

write
these

<EOS>
nothing

be
more
unlike
their
habit
.
 
<EOS>
the
writer
be
public
robber

and
we
who

them
be
party
to
their
depredation

<EOS>
They
trade
upon
every
circumstance
within
their
knowledge
that
affect
us
,
public

joyful

they
pervert
the

our
life
;
they
change
what
ought
to
be
our
strength
and
virtue
into
weakness
,
and
encouragement
of
vice
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
plain
remedy
,
and
it
be
in
our
own
hand
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
resolve
,
at
any
sacrifice
of
feeling
,
to
be
deaf
to
such
appeal
,
and
crush
the
trade
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
degree
in
murder

<EOS>
life
must
be
hold
sacred
among
us
in
more
way

one
---
sacred
,
not
merely
from
the
murderous
weapon
,
or
the
subtle
poison
,
or
the
cruel
blow
,
but
sacred
from
preventible
disease

distortion

and
pain

<EOS>
that
be
the

great
end
we
have
to
set
against
this
miserable
imposition

<EOS>
what

not
content
a
Begging

Writer

would
educate
a

<EOS>
let

<EOS>
let
us
do
all
we
can
;
let
us
do
more
than

<EOS>
but
let
us
give
,
and
do
,
with
a
high
purpose
;
not
to
endow
the
scum
of
the
earth
,
to
its

great
corruption

with
the
offal
of
our
duty

<EOS>
a
Child
's
Dream
of
a
star
 
<EOS>
there
be
once
a
child
,
and
he
stroll
about
a
good
deal
,
and
think
of
a
number
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
sister
,
who
be
a
child
too
,
and
his
constant
companion
.
 
<EOS>
these
two
use
to
wonder
all
day
long
.
 
<EOS>
They
wonder
at
the
beauty
of
the
flower
;
they
wonder
at
the
height
and
blueness
of
the
sky
;
they
wonder
at
the
depth
of
the
bright
water
;
they
wonder
at
the
goodness
and
the
power
of
GOD
who
make
the
lovely
world
.
   
<EOS>
They
use
to
say
to
one
another
,
sometimes
,
suppose
all
the
child
upon
earth
be
to
die
,
would
the
flower
,
and
the
water
,
and
the
sky
be
sorry
?
 
<EOS>
They
believe
they
would
be
sorry
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
say
they
,
the
bud
be
the
child
of
the
flower
,
and
the
little
playful
stream
that
gambol
down
the
hill
-
side
be
the
child
of
the
water
;
and
the
small
bright
speck
play
at
hide
and
seek
in
the
sky
all
night
,
must
surely
be
the
child
of
the
star
;
and
they
would
all
be
grieve
to
see
their
playmate
,
the
child
of
man
,
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
one
clear
shine
star
that
use
to
come
out
in
the
sky
before
the
rest
,
near
the
church
spire
,
above
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
large
and
more
beautiful
,
they
think
,
than
all
the
other
,
and
every
night
they
watch
for
it
,
stand
hand
in
hand
at
a
window
.
<EOS>
whoever
see
it
first
cry
out
,
"
I
see
the
star
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
often
they
cry
out
both
together
,
know
so
well
when
it
would
rise
,
and
where
.
 
<EOS>
so
they
grow
to
be
such
friend
with
it
,
that
,
before
lie
down
in
their
bed
,
they
always
look
out
once
again
,
to
bid
it
good
night
;
and
when
they
be
turn
round
to
sleep
,
they
use
to
say
,
"
God
bless
the
star
!
"
   
<EOS>
but
while
she
be
still
very
young
,
oh
,
very
,
very
young
,
the
sister
droop
,
and
come
to
be
so
weak
that
she
could
no
longer
stand
in
the
window
at
night
;
and
then
the
child
look
sadly
out
by
himself
,
and
when
he
see
the
star
,
turn
round
and
say
to
the
patient
pale
face
on
the
bed
,
"
I
see
the
star
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
a
smile
would
come
upon
the
face
,
and
a
little
weak
voice
use
to
say
,
"
God
bless
my
brother
and
the
star
!
"
   
<EOS>
and
so
the
time
come
all
too
soon
!
<EOS>
when
the
child
look
out
alone
,
and
when
there
be
no
face
on
the
bed
;
and
when
there
be
a
little
grave
among
the
grave
,
not
there
before
;
and
when
the
star
make
long
ray
down
towards
him
,
as
he
see
it
through
his
tear
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
these
ray
be
so
bright
,
and
they
seem
to
make
such
a
shining
way
from
earth
to
Heaven
,
that
when
the
child
go
to
his
solitary
bed
,
he
dream
about
the
star
;
and
dream
that
,
lie
where
he
be
,
he
see
a
train
of
people
take
up
that
sparkle
road
by
angel
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
star
,
opening
,
show
him
a
great
world
of
light
,
where
many
more
such
angel
wait
to
receive
them
.
   
<EOS>
all
these
angel
,
who
be
wait
,
turn
their
beam
eye
upon
the
people
who
be
carry
up
into
the
star
;
and
some
come
out
from
the
long
row
in
which
they
stand
,
and
fall
upon
the
people
's
neck
,
and
kiss
them
tenderly
,
and
go
away
with
them
down
avenue
of
light
,
and
be
so
happy
in
their
company
,
that
lie
in
his
bed
he
weep
for
joy
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
there
be
many
angel
who
do
not
go
with
them
,
and
among
them
one
he
know
.
 
<EOS>
the
patient
face
that
once
have
lain
upon
the
bed
be
glorify
and
radiant
,
but
his
heart
find
out
his
sister
among
all
the
host
.
   
<EOS>
His
sister
's
angel
linger
near
the
entrance
of
the
star
,
and
say
to
the
leader
among
those
who
have
bring
the
people
thither
:
   
"
<EOS>
be
my
brother
come
?
"
   
<EOS>
and
he
say
"
no
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
be
turn
hopefully
away
,
when
the
child
stretch
out
his
arm
,
and
cry
,
"
o
,
sister
,
I
be
here
!
 
<EOS>
take
me
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
she
turn
her
beam
eye
upon
him
,
and
it
be
night
;
and
the
star
be
shine
into
the
room
,
make
long
ray
down
towards
him
as
he
see
it
through
his
tear
.
   
<EOS>
from
that
hour
forth
,
the
child
look
out
upon
the
star
as
on
the
home
<EOS>
he
be
to
go
to
,
when
his
time
should
come
;
and
he
think
that
he
do
not
belong
to
the
earth
alone
,
but
to
the
star
too
,
because
of
his
sister
's
angel
go
before
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
baby
bear
to
be
a
brother
to
the
child
;
and
while
he
be
so
little
that
he
never
yet
have
speak
word
,
he
stretch
his
tiny
form
out
on
his
bed
,
and
die
.
   
<EOS>
again
the
child
dream
of
the
open
star
,
and
of
the
company
of
angel
,
and
the
train
of
people
,
and
the
row
of
angel
with
their
beam
eye
all
turn
upon
those
people
's
face
.
   
<EOS>
say
his
sister
's
angel
to
the
leader
:
   
<EOS>
"
be
my
brother
come
?
"
   
<EOS>
and
he
say
,
"
<EOS>
not
that
one
,
but
another
.
"
   
<EOS>
as
the
child
behold
his
brother
's
angel
in
her
arm
,
he
cry
,
"
o
,
sister
,
<EOS>
I
be
here
!
 
<EOS>
take
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
she
turn
and
smile
upon
him
,
and
the
star
be
shine
.
   
<EOS>
He
grow
to
be
a
young
man
,
and
be
busy
at
his
book
when
an
old
servant
come
to
him
and
say
:
   
<EOS>
"
Thy
mother
be
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
bring
her
blessing
on
her
darle
son
!
"
   
<EOS>
again
at
night
he
see
the
star
,
and
all
that
former
company
.
 
<EOS>
say
his
sister
's
angel
to
the
leader
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
my
brother
come
?
"
   
<EOS>
and
he
say
,
"
<EOS>
Thy
mother
!
"
   
<EOS>
a
mighty
cry
of
joy
go
forth
through
all
the
star
,
because
the
mother
be
re
-
united
to
her
two
child
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
stretch
out
his
arm
and
cry
,
"
o
,
mother
,
sister
,
and
brother
,
I
be
here
!
 
<EOS>
take
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
they
answer
him
,
"
not
yet
,
"
and
the
star
be
shine
.
   
<EOS>
He
grow
to
be
a
man
,
whose
hair
be
turn
grey
,
and
he
be
sit
in
his
chair
by
the
fireside
,
heavy
with
grief
,
and
with
his
face
bedew
with
tear
,
when
the
star
open
once
again
.
   
<EOS>
say
his
sister
's
angel
to
the
leader
:
"
be
my
brother
come
?
"
   
<EOS>
and
he
say
,
"
Nay
,
but
his
maiden
daughter
.
"
   
<EOS>
and
the
man
who
have
be
the
child
see
his
daughter
,
newly
lose
to
him
,
a
celestial
creature
among
those
three
,
and
he
say
,
"
My
daughter
's
head
be
on
my
sister
's
bosom
,
and
her
arm
be
around
my
mother
's
neck
,
and
at
her
foot
there
be
the
baby
of
old
time
,
and
I
can
bear
the
parting
from
her
,
GOD
be
praise
!
"
   
<EOS>
and
the
star
be
shine
.
   
<EOS>
thus
the
child
come
to
be
an
old
man
,
and
his
once
smooth
face
be
wrinkle
,
and
his
step
be
slow
and
feeble
,
and
his
back
be
bent
.
 
<EOS>
and
one
night
as
he
lie
upon
his
bed
,
his
child
stand
round
,
he
cry
,
as
he
have
cry
so
long
ago
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
the
star

"
   
<EOS>
They
whisper
one
another
,
"
He
be
die

"
   
<EOS>
and
he
say
,
"
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
My
age
be
fall
from
me
like
a
garment
,
and
I
move
towards
the
star
as
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
and
o

my
Father
,
now
I
thank
thee
that
it

so
often

to
receive
those
dear

"
   
<EOS>
and
the
star
be
shine

and

shine
upon
his
grave

Our

We

You

you

diminutive

They

before
they

it

<EOS>
on
the

the

if
you

down
here
in
August

September
,
you
would
not
find
a

<EOS>
as
to
find
either
house

of

you

you
could
scarcely
engage

more
hopeless
pursuit

<EOS>
for
all
this

you
be
to
observe
that
every

be
the
bad
season
ever

and
that
the
householde
population
of

<EOS>
They
be
like

They
all
do

it

Their

their
politeness
under

bespeak

You
would
say
so

if
you
only
see
the

help
a

<EOS>
so
far

if

the
gorgeous

wait
upon

at

you

We
have
a
pier

a

fortunately

They
lounge

the

the

this
,
and
for
the
recollection
of
their
comrade
whom
we
have
know
,
whom
the
rage
sea
have
engulf
before
their
child
's
eye
in
such
brave
effort
,
whom
the
secret
sand
have
bury
,
we
hold
the
boatman
of
our
watering
-
place
in
our
love
and
honour
,
and
be
tender
of
the
fame
they
well
deserve
.
   
<EOS>
so
many
child
be
bring
down
to
our
watering
-
place
that
,
when
they
be
not
out
of
door
,
as
they
usually
be
in
fine
weather
,
it
be
wonderful
where
they
be
put
:
the
whole
village
seem
much
too
small
to
hold
them
under
cover
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
,
you
see
no
end
of
salt
and
sandy
little
boot
dry
on
upper
window
-
sill
.
 
<EOS>
at
bathing
-
time
in
the
morning
,
the
little
bay
re
-
echo
with
every
shrill
variety
of
shriek
and
splash
---
after
which
,
if
the
weather
be
at
all
fresh
,
the
sand
teem
with
small
blue
mottle
leg
.
 
<EOS>
the
sand
be
the
child
's
great
resort
.
 
<EOS>
They
cluster
there
,
like
ant
:
<EOS>
so
busy
bury
their
particular
friend
,
and
make
castle
with
infinite
labour
which
the
next
tide
overthrow
,
that
it
be
curious
to
consider
how
their
play
,
to
the
music
of
the
sea
,
foreshadow
the
reality
of
their
after
life
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
curious
,
too
,
to
observe
a
natural
ease
of
approach
that
there
seem
to
be
between
the
child
and
the
boatman
.
 
<EOS>
They
mutually
make
acquaintance
,
and
take
individual
liking
,
without
any
help
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
come
upon
one
of
those
slow
heavy
fellow
sit
down
patiently
mend
a
little
ship
for
a
mite
of
a
boy
,
whom
he
could
crush
to
death
by
throw
his
light
pair
of
trouser
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
be
sensible
of
the
oddest
contrast
between
the
smooth
little
creature
,
and
the
rough
man
who
seem
to
be
carve
out
of
hard
-
grain
wood
---
between
the
delicate
hand
expectantly
hold
out
,
and
the
immense
thumb
and
finger
that
can
hardly
feel
the
rigging
of
thread
they
mend
---
between
the
small
voice
and
the
gruff
growl
---
and
yet
there
be
a
natural
propriety
in
the
companionship
:
always
to
be
note
in
confidence
between
a
child
and
a
person
who
have
any
merit
of
reality
and
genuineness
:
which
be
admirably
pleasant
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
a
preventive
station
at

and
much
the
same
thing

be
observe
---
in

We

the

a

of
the

about
cut

long
street

begin
with
an

end
with

which
it

our

to
behold
only
at
daybreak
on
winter
morning

when
(

,
just
sufficiently
awake

it

in

the

the

combine

even
we

stagger

one
September

stand
a
military

make
a

<EOS>
two
idea
be
generally
present
to
the
british

during
these
ceremony
;
first
,
that
it
be
necessary
to
make
for
the
cell
with
violent
struggle
,
as
if
it
be
a
life
-
boat
and
the
dungeon
a
ship
go
down
;
secondly
,
that
the
military
creature
's
arm
be
a
national
affront
,
which
the
government
at
home
ought
instantly
to
"
take
up

"
 
<EOS>
the
british

delirious

and
extravagant
action
perform

<EOS>
thus
,
Johnson
persist
in
give
Johnson
as
his

and
substitute

his
ancestral
designation
the
national
"
Dam

"
<EOS>
neither
can
he
by
any
mean
be
bring

recognise
the
distinction

but
will
obstinately
persevere
in
tender
the
one
when
ask

the
other
.
 
<EOS>
this
bring
him
to
the
fourth

,
in
a
state
of
mere
idiotcy

and
when
he
be
,
in
the
fourth
place
,
cast
out
at
a
little
door
into
a
howl
wilderness
of
touter

he
become
a

wild

float

<EOS>
if
friendless

unrescued

he

therefore
infinitely
more
healthy

<EOS>
still
,
it
be
a
bright
,
airy
,
pleasant
,
cheerful
town
;
and
if
you
be
to
walk
down
either
of
its
three
well

pave
main
street
,
towards
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
when
delicate
odour
of
cookery
fill
the
air
,
and
its
hotel
window
(
it
be
full
of
hotel
)
give
glimpse
of
long
table
set
out
for
dinner
,
and
make
to
look
sumptuous
by
the
aid
of

-
wise
,
you
would
rightly
judge
it
to
be
an
uncommonly
good
town
to
eat
and
drink
in

<EOS>
We
have
an
old
walled
town
,
rich
in
cool
public
well
of
water
,
on
the
top
of
a
hill
within

above

and
if
it

a
clear

,
within

of

cliff
of
Dover
,
you
would
long
ago
have
be
bore
to
death
about
that
town
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
more
picturesque
and
quaint
than
half
the
innocent

which
tourist

follow
their

like

have
make
impostor
of

<EOS>
to
say
nothing
of
its

with
grave

,
its
queer

,
and
its
many

windowed
street
white
and
quiet
in

,
there
be
an
ancient
belfry
in
it
that
would

these

happily
it

without

about

<EOS>
We
regard
it
as
one
of

that

always

for

Heaven

<EOS>
there

It

It

<EOS>
We

another

that

a

in

devote

Our

be
famous
everywhere

and
our
fishing
people
,
though
they
love
lively
colour
,
and
taste
be
neutral
(
see
Bilkins
)
,
be
among
the
most
picturesque
people
we
ever
encounter
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
not
only
a
quarter
of
their
own
in
the
town
itself
,
but
they
occupy
whole
village
of
their
own
on
the
neighbouring
cliff
.
 
<EOS>
Their
church
and
chapel
be
their
own
;
they
consort
with
one
another
,
they
intermarry
among
themselves
,
their
custom
be
their
own
,
and
their
costume
be
their
own
and
never
change
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
one
of
their
boy
can
walk
,
he
be
provide
with
a
long
bright
red
nightcap
;
and
one
of
their
man
would
as
soon
think
of
go
afloat
without
his
head
,
as
without
that
indispensable
appendage
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
they
wear
the
noble
boot
,
with
the
huge
top
---
flap
and
bulge
over
anyhow
;
above
which
,
they
encase
themselves
in
such
wonderful
overall
and
petticoat
trouser
,
make
to
all
appearance
of
tarry
old
sail
,
so
additionally
stiffen
with
pitch
and
salt
,
that
the
wearer
have
a
walk
of
their
own
,
and
go
straddle
and
swinge
about
among
the
boat
and
barrel
and
net
and
rigging
,
a
sight
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
their
young
woman
,
by
dint
of
go
down
to
the
sea
barefoot
,
to
fle
their
basket
into
the
boat
as
they
come
in
with
the
tide
,
and
bespeak
the
first
fruit
of
the
haul
with
propitiatory
promise
to
love
and
marry
that
dear
fisherman
who
shall
fill
that
basket
like
an
Angel
,
have
the
fine
leg
ever
carve
by
Nature
in
the
bright
mahogany
,
and
they
walk
like
Juno

<EOS>
Their
eye
,
too
,
be
so
lustrous
that
their
long
gold
ear

ring
turn
dull
beside
those
brilliant
neighbour
;
and
when
they
be
dress
,
what
with
these
beauty

their
fine
fresh

and
their
many
petticoat

close

and
what
with
the
natural
grace
with
which
they
wear
the
common
cap
,
or
fold
the
common
handkerchief
round
their
luxuriant
hair
---
we
say
,
in
a
word
and
out
of
breath
,
that
take
all
these
premise
into
our
consideration
,
it
have
never
be
a
matter
of
the
least
surprise
to
us
that
we
have
never
once
meet
,
in
the
cornfield
,
on
the
dusty
road
,
by
the
breezy
windmill
,
on
the
plot
of
short
sweet

overhang
the

---
anywhere
---
a
young
fisherman
and
fisherwoman
of
our
french
watering

place
together
,
but
the
arm
of
that
fisherman
have
invariably
be
,
as
a
matter
of
course
and
without
any
absurd
attempt
to
disguise
so
plain
a
necessity
,
round
the
neck
or
waist
of
that
fisherwoman
.
 
<EOS>
and
we
have
have
no
doubt
whatever
,
stand
look
at
their
uphill
street

house

above

and
terrace
above

<EOS>
be

in
the
eye
of
every
true
young
fisherman

a
mist
of
love
and
beauty
,
set
off
the
goddess
of
his
heart

<EOS>
moreover
it
be
to
be
observe
that
these
be
an
industrious
people
,
and
a
domestic
people
,
and
an
honest
people

<EOS>
and
though
we
be
aware
that
at
the
bidding
of
Bilkins
it
be
our
duty
to
fall
down
and
worship
the
Neapolitans
,
we
make
bold
very
much
to
prefer
the
fishing
people
of
our
french
watering
-
place
---
especially
since
our
last
visit
to
Naples
within
these
twelvemonth
,
when
we
find
only
four
condition
of

remain
in
the
whole
city
:
to
wit
,
lazzaroni
,
priest
,
spy
,
and
soldier

and
all
of
them
beggar
;
the
paternal
government
have
banish
all
its
subject
except
the
rascal

<EOS>
but
we
can
never
henceforth
separate
our
french

from
our

M

permit

the

<EOS>
His
own
family
name
be
simply
loyal

but
,
as
he
be
married
,
and
as
in
that
part
of
France
a
husband
always
add
to
his
own
name
the
family
name
of
his

,
he
write
himself
Loyal

<EOS>
He
own
a
compact
little
estate
of
some
twenty

thirty
acre
on
a
lofty

side

and
on
it
he
have
build
two
country
house

which
he

They
be
by
many
degree
the

the

a

represent
it
as
about
twice
the

of

insomuch
that
when
we
be
yet
new
to
the
property
(
M
Loyal
always
speak
of
it
as
"
La

<EOS>
we
go
three
mile
straight
on
end
in
search
of

which
we

find
to
be
immediately
outside

<EOS>
the

accord

about
two
league

we
seek
in

for
a

until

happen
one
evening
to
sit
upon
a
bench
in
the
forest
(

,
a
few

from
the

we
observe
at
our
foot
,
in
the
ignominious
circumstance
of
be
upside
down
and
greenly
rotten
,
the
Old

himself
:
that
be
to
say
,
the

<EOS>
during
the

it
be
our
affliction
to
be
constantly
knock
down
Napoleon

if
we

corner

he
topple

we

shake

yet
M

be
not
a
man
of

He

He
unite
french

in

quite

<EOS>
He
have
an
extraordinary
genius
for
make
tasteful
little

which
an

would

soon
think

<EOS>
We
have
ourself
repose
deliciously
in
an
elegant
chamber
of
M
Loyal
's
construction
,
with
our
head
as
nearly
in
the
kitchen
chimney

pot
as
we
can
conceive
it
likely
for
the
head
of
any
gentleman
,
not
by

a

and
,
into

M

penetrate
,
it
,
in

nook
,
infallibly
construct
a
cupboard

a

<EOS>
in
either

we
could
have
put
away
the

and
hang
up
the

<EOS>
Aforetime

M

We

They

He

you

not

and

it
may

very

and
you
shall
discern
in
M

a
gentleman
whose
true
politeness
be
ingrain
,
and
confirmation
of
whose
word
by
his
bond
<EOS>
you
would
blush
to

<EOS>
not
without
reason
be
M
Loyal
when
he
tell
that
story
,
in
his
own
vivacious
way
,
of
his
travelling
to
Fulham
,
near
London
,
to
buy
all
these
hundred
and
hundred
of
tree
you
now
see
upon
the

,
then
a
bare
,
bleak
hill
;
and
of
his
sojourning
in
Fulham
three
month
;
and
of
his
jovial
evening
with
the
market
-
gardener
;
and
of
the
crowning
banquet
before
his
departure
,
when
the
market

gardener
rise
as
one
man
,
clink
their
glass
all
together
(
as
the
custom
at
Fulham
be
)
,
and
cry
,
"
vive
loyal
!
"
   
<EOS>
M
Loyal
have
an
agreeable
wife
,
but
no
family

and
he
love
to
drill
the
child
of
his

or
run
race
with

or
do
anything
with

or
for

that
be
good

natured

<EOS>
He
be
of
a
highly
convivial
temperament

and
his
hospitality
be
unbounded

<EOS>
billet
a
soldier

he
be
delighted

<EOS>
five

thirty
soldier
have
M
Loyal
billet
on
him
this
present
summer
,
and
they
all
get
fat

red

face
in

<EOS>
It
become
a
legend
among
the
troop
that
whosoever
get
billet
on
M
Loyal
roll
in
clover
;
and
so
it
fall
out
that
the
fortunate
man
who
draw
the
billet
"
M
Loyal
Devasseur
"
always
leap
into
the

though
in
heavy
marching
order
.
 
<EOS>
M
Loyal
can
not
bear
to
admit
anything
that
may
seem
by
any
implication
to
disparage
the
military
profession
.
<EOS>
We
hint
to
him
once
,
that
we
be
conscious
of
a
remote
doubt
arise
in
our
mind
,
whether
a
sou
a
day
for
pocket
-
money
,
tobacco
,
stocking
,
drink
,
washing
,
and
social
pleasure
in
general
,
leave
a
very
large
margin
for
a
soldier
's
enjoyment
.
 
<EOS>
Pardon
!
<EOS>
say
Monsieur
Loyal
,
rather
wince
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
fortune
,
but
---
<EOS>
a
la
bonne
heure
---
it
be
well
than
it
use
to
be
!
 
<EOS>
what
,
we
ask
him
on
another
occasion
,
be
all
those
neighbouring
peasant
,
each
live
with
his
family
in
one
room
,
and
each
have
a
soldier
(
perhaps
two
)
billet
on
him
every
other
night
,
require
to
provide
for
those
soldier
?
 
<EOS>
"
Faith
!
<EOS>
"
say
M
Loyal
,
reluctantly
;
a
bed
,
monsieur
,
and
fire
to
cook
with
,
and
a
candle
.
 
<EOS>
and
they
share
their
supper
with
those
soldier
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
possible
that
they
could
eat
alone
.
"
---
<EOS>
"
and
what
allowance
do
they
get
for
this
?
"
say
we
.
 
<EOS>
Monsieur
Loyal
draw
himself
up
taller
,
take
a
step
back
,
lay
his
hand
upon
his
breast
,
and
say
,
with
majesty
,
as
speak
for
himself
and
all
France
,
"
Monsieur

it
be
a
contribution
to

<EOS>
It
be
never
go

accord
to
M

.
 
<EOS>
when
it
be
impossible
to
deny
that
it
be
now
rain
in
torrent
,
he
say
it
will
be
fine
---
charming
---
magnificent
---
to

morrow
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
never
hot
on
the
Property
,
he
contend
.
 
<EOS>
likewise
it
be
never
cold
.
 
<EOS>
the
flower
,
he
say
,
come
out
,
delight
to
grow
there
;
it
be
like
Paradise
this
morning
;
it
be
like
the
Garden
of
Eden
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
little
fanciful
in
his
language
:
smilingly
observe
of
Madame
Loyal
,
when
she
be
absent
at
vesper
,
that
she
be
"
go
to
her
salvation
"
---
allee
a
son
salut
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
great
enjoyment
of
tobacco
,
but
nothing
would
induce
him
to
continue
smoke
face
to
face
with
a
lady
.
 
<EOS>
His
short
black
pipe
immediately
go
into
his
breast
pocket
,
scorch
his
blouse
,
and
nearly
set
him
on
fire
.
<EOS>
in
the
Town
Council
and
on
occasion
of
ceremony
,
he
appear
in
a
full
suit
of
black
,
with
a
waistcoat
of
magnificent
breadth
across
the
chest
,
and
a
shirt

collar
of
fabulous
proportion

<EOS>
Good
M

<EOS>
under
blouse
or
waistcoat
,
he
carry
one
of
the
gentle
heart
that
beat
in
a
nation
teem
with
gentle
people

<EOS>
He
have
have
loss
,
and
have
be
at
his
good

them
.
 
<EOS>
not
only
the
loss
of
his
way
by
night
in
the
Fulham
time
---
when
a
bad
subject
of
an
Englishman
,
under
pretence
of
see
him
home
,
take
him
into
all
the
night
public

house
,
drank
"
arfanarf
"
in
every
one
at
his
expense
,
and
finally
flee
,
leave
him
shipwreck
at
Cleefeeway
,
which
we
apprehend
to
be
Ratcliffe
Highway
---
but
heavy
loss
than
that
.
 
<EOS>
long
ago
a
family
of
child
and
a
mother
be
leave
in
one
of
his
house
without
money
,
a
whole
year
.
 
<EOS>
M
Loyal
---
<EOS>
anything
but
as
rich
as
we
wish
he
have
be
---
have
not
the
heart
to
say
"
you
must
go
;
"
so
they
stay
on
and
stay
on
,
and
pay
-
tenant
who
would
have
come
in
could
not
come
in
,
and
at
last
they
manage
to
get
help
home
across
the
water
;
and
M
Loyal
kiss
the
whole
group
,
and
say
,
"
adieu
,
my
poor
infant
!
"
and
sit
down
in
their
desert
salon
and
smoke
his
pipe
of
peace

<EOS>

"

M

"
 
"
<EOS>
eh

M

"
Le

"
say
M

presently

"
will
recompense

and
he
laugh

smoke
his

peace

May
he
smoke
it
on

and
not

these
fifty

<EOS>
there
be
public
amusement
in
our
french
watering

place

or
it
would
not

<EOS>
They
be
very
popular

and
very
cheap

<EOS>
the
sea
-
bathing
---
which
may
rank
as
the
most
favoured
daylight
entertainment
,
inasmuch
as
the
french
visitor
bathe
all
day
long
,
and
seldom
appear
to
think
of
remain
less
than
an
hour
at
a
time
in

be
astoundingly
cheap

<EOS>
Omnibuses
convey
you
,
if
you
please
,
from
a
convenient
part
of
the
town
to
the
beach
and
back
again
;
you
have
a
clean
and
comfortable
bathing
-
machine
,
dress
,
linen
,
and
all
appliance
;
and
the
charge
for
the
whole
be
half
-
a

franc
,
or
fivepence
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
pier
,
there
be
usually
a
guitar
,
which
seem
presumptuously
enough
to
set
its
tinkling
against
the
deep
hoarseness
of
the
sea
,
and
there
be
always
some
boy
or
woman
who
sing
,
without
any
voice
,
little
song
without
any
tune
:
the
strain
we
have
most
frequently
hear
be
an
appeal
to
"
<EOS>
the
sportsman
"
not
to
bag
that
choicest
of
game
,
the
swallow
.
 
<EOS>
for
bathing
purpose
,
we
have
also
a
subscription
establishment
with
an
esplanade
,
where
people
lounge
about
with
telescope
,
and
seem
to
get
a
good
deal
of
weariness
for
their
money
;
and
we
have
also
an
association
of
individual
machine
proprietor
combine
against
this
formidable
rival
.
 
<EOS>
M
Feroce
,
our
own
particular
friend
in
the
bathing
line
,
be
one
of
these
.
 
<EOS>
how
he
ever
come
by
his
name
we
can
not
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
as
gentle
and
polite
a
man
as
M
Loyal
Devasseur
himself
;
immensely
stout
withal
;
and
of
a
beam
aspect
.
<EOS>
M
Feroce
have
save
so
many
people
from
drown
,
and
have
be
decorate
with
so
many
medal
in
consequence
,
that
his
stoutness
seem
a
special
dispensation
of
Providence
to
enable
him
to
wear
them
;
if
his
girth
be
the
girth
of
an
ordinary
man
,
he
could
never
hang
them
on
,
all
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
on
very
great
occasion
that
M
Feroce
display
his
shine
honour
.
 
<EOS>
at
other
time
they
lie
by
,
with
roll
of
manuscript
testify
to
the
cause
of
their
presentation
,
in
a
huge
glass
case
in
the
red

sofa'd
salon
of
his
private
residence
on
the
beach
,
where
M
Feroce
also
keep
his
family
picture
,
his
portrait
of
himself
as
he
appear
both
in
bathe
life
and
in
private
life
,
his
little
boat
that
rock
by
clockwork
,
and
his
other
ornamental
possession
.
   
<EOS>
then
,
we
have
a
commodious
and
gay
Theatre
---
or
have
,
for
it
be
burn
down
now
---
where
the
opera
be
always
precede

a
vaudeville

in
which
(
as

everybody
,
down
to
the
little

man
with
the
large
hat
and
the
little
cane
and
tassel
,
who
always
play
either
my
Uncle

my

,
suddenly
break
out
of
the
dialogue
into
the
mild
vocal
snatch
,
to
the
great
perplexity
of
unaccustomed
stranger
from
Great
Britain
,
who
never
could
make
out
when
they
be
singe
and
when
they
be
talk

and
indeed
it
be
pretty
much
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
caterer
in
the
way
of
entertainment
to
whom
we
be
most
beholden
,
be
the
Society
of
Welldoing
,
who
be
active
all
the
summer
,
and
give
the
proceed
of
their
good
work
to
the

<EOS>
some
of
the
most
agreeable
fete
they
contrive
,
be
announce
as
"
dedicated
to
the
child

"
and
the
taste
with
which
they
turn
a
small
public
enclosure
into
an
elegant
garden
beautifully
illuminate
;
and
the
thorough

go
heartiness
and
energy
with
which
they
personally
direct
the
childish
pleasure
;
be
supremely
delightful

<EOS>
for
fivepence
<EOS>
a

,
we
have
on
these
occasion
donkey

with
English

dance

<EOS>
further
,
almost
every
week
all
through
the
summer
---
never
mind
,
now
,
on
what
day
of
the

---
there
be
a
fete
in
some
adjoining
village
(
call
in

part
of
the

a
Ducasse

,
where
the
people
---
really
the
PEOPLE

dance
on
the
green
turf
in
the
open
air
,
round
a
little
orchestra
<EOS>
,
that
seem
itself
to
dance
,
there
be
such
an
airy
motion
of
flag
and
streamer
all
about
it

<EOS>
and
we
do
not
suppose
that
between
the
Torrid

there
be
to

male

such
astonishingly
loose

sometimes

the

<EOS>
It
be
not
without
a
sentiment
of
national
pride
that
we
believe
them
to
contain
more
bore
from
the

of
Albion
than
all

<EOS>
as

<EOS>
We

never
overhear
at
street
corner
such
lunatic
scrap
of
political

social
discussion
as
among
these
dear
countryman
of
ours

<EOS>
They
believe
everything
that

impossible
and
nothing
that

true

<EOS>
They
carry
rumour

and
ask
question

and
make
correction
and
improvement

another

stagger
to
the
human
intellect

<EOS>
and
they
be
for

propound
such
incomprehensible
paradox
to

that
we

her
to

be
deservedly

respect
in
many
way

<EOS>
some
of
the

-
address
to
them
be
odd
enough
,
as
when
a

put
a

outside
her

announce
her
possession
of
that
curious
british
instrument
,
a

when

<EOS>
but
,
to
us
,
it
be
not
the

pleasant
feature
of
our

that
a
long

constant

Drumming

at

too

but
,
we
cheerfully
avow
that
we
consider
a

a
very
pretty
object
,
and
that
we
take
such
outward

liveliness
to

<EOS>
the

Bill

Sticking
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
an
enemy
whom
I
hate
---
which
Heaven
forbid

<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
if
I
know
of
something
which
sit
heavy
on
his

I
think
I
would
introduce
that
something
into
a
Posting

,
and
place
a
large
impression
in
the
hand
of
an
active

.
 
<EOS>
I
can
scarcely
imagine
a
more
terrible
revenge
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
haunt
him
,
by
this
mean
,
night
and
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
say
that
I
would
publish
his
secret
,
in
red
letter
two
foot
high
,
for
all
the

to
read
:
I
would
darkly
refer
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
should
be
between
him
,
and
me
,
and
the
Posting

.
 
<EOS>
say
,
for
example
,
that
,
at
a
certain
period
of
his
life
,
my
enemy
have
surreptitiously
possess
himself
of
a
key
.
<EOS>
I
would
then
embark
my
capital
in
the
lock
business
,
and
conduct
that
business
on
the
advertising
principle
.
 
<EOS>
in
all
my
placard
and
advertisement
,
I
would
throw
up
the
line
SECRET
KEYS
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
if
my
enemy
pass
an
uninhabited
house
,
he
would
see
his
conscience
glare
down
on
him
from
the
parapet
,
and
peep
up
at
him
from
the
cellar
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
take
a
dead
wall
in
his
walk
,
it
would
be
alive
with
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
seek
refuge
in
an
omnibus
,
the
panel
thereof
would
become
Belshazzar
's
palace
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
take
boat
,
in
a
wild
endeavour
to
escape
,
he
would
see
the
fatal
word
lurk
under
the
arch
of
the
bridge
over
the
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
walk
the
street
with
downcast
eye
,
he
would
recoil
from
the
very
stone
of
the
pavement
,
make
eloquent
by
lamp
-
black
lithograph
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
drive
or
ride
,
his
way
would
be
block
up
by
enormous
van
,
each
proclaim
the
same
word
over
and
over
again
from
its
whole
extent
of
surface
.
 
<EOS>
until
,
have
gradually
grow
thin
and
paler
,
and
have
at
last
totally
reject
food
,
he
would
miserably
perish
,
and
I
should
be
revenge
.
 
<EOS>
this
conclusion
<EOS>
I
should
,
no
doubt
,
celebrate
by
laugh
a
hoarse
laugh
in
three
syllable
,
and
fold
my
arm
tight
upon
my
chest
agreeably
to
most
of
the
example
of
glutted
animosity
that
I
have
have
an
opportunity
of

in

with
the

which

the

present
themselves

the

I

London
from
the
East
Riding
of

on
a

,
an
old
warehouse
which
rot
paste
and
rot
paper
have
bring
down
to
the
condition
of
an
old

<EOS>
It
would
have
be
impossible
to
say
,
on
the
most
conscientious
survey
,
how
much
of
its
front
be
brick
and
mortar
,
and
how
much
decay
and
decayed
plaster
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
thickly
encrust
with
fragment
of
bill
,
that
no
ship

after
a
long
voyage
could
be
half
so
foul

<EOS>
all
trace
of
the
broken

be
bill
out
,
the

be
bill

the

<EOS>
the

be
shore
up

prevent
its
tumbling
into
the
street
;
and
the
very
beam
erect
against
it
be
less
wood
than
paste

paper
,
they
have
be
so
continually
post

reposte

<EOS>
the
forlorn
dreg
of
old

so
encumber
this
wreck
,
that
there
be
no
hold
for
new

and
the
sticker
have
abandon
the
place
in
despair
,
except
one
enterprising
man
who
have
hoist
the
last
masquerade
to
a
clear
spot
near

here

some

thick

have
peel
off

still

I

what
an

it

do
I

at

<EOS>
that

a
solemn

robbery

the

at

<EOS>
curious

insensible
by

whose

I

proceed

dimly

<EOS>
the

enter
the

I

not
refrain
from
mount
on
the
shaft
of
the
second

and
look
in

<EOS>
I
then
beheld
,
recline
on
his

upon
the
floor

on
a

the
exclamation
<EOS>
"

which
irresistibly
escape
my

upright

me

I

him
to

He
look

I
look
at
him
,
until
the
driver
displace
me
by
hand
in
a
pint
of
beer
,
a
pipe
,
and
what
I
understand
be
call
"
a
screw
"
of
tobacco

an

have
the
appearance

paper
take
off

to

we

pace

<EOS>
I
say
to
my
great
delight
,
because
I
be
very
fond
of
novelty

it
be
a
new
sensation
to
be
jolt
through

seclude
Temple

partly
open

be
enchant

contrast

since

the
first
party
that
start

be
twelve
year

but
what
be
leave
of
the
old
school

their
dependant
join
together
and
oppose
them

<EOS>
and
for
some
time
we
be
quiet
again
,
till
a
printer
of
Hatton

form
a
company
by
hire
the
side

;
but
he
be
not
support
by

and
he
leave
his
wooden

fix
up

<EOS>
the
last
company
that
start
,
take
advantage
of
the
New
Police
Act
,
and
hire
of
Messrs.

Peto
the
hoarding
of
Trafalgar

,
and
establish
a
bill

stick
office
in
Cursitor

,
Chancery
Lane
,
and
engage
some
of
the
new
bill

to
do
their
work
,
and
for
a
time
get
the
half
of
all
our
work
,
and
with
such
spirit
do
they
carry
on
their
opposition
towards
us
,
that
they
use
to
give
us
in
charge
before
the
magistrate
,
and
get
us
fine
;
but
they
find
it
so
expensive
,
that
they
could
not
keep
it
up
,
for
they
be
always
employ
a
lot
of
ruffian
from
the
Seven
Dials
to
come
and
fight
us
;
and
on
one
occasion
the
old
bill

go
to
Trafalgar
Square
to
attempt
to
post
bill
,
when
they
be
give
in
custody
by
the
watchman
in
their
employ
,
and
fine
at
Queen
Square
five
pound
,
as
they
would
not
allow
any
of
us
to
speak
in
the
office
;
but
when
they
be
go
,
we
have
an
interview
with
the
magistrate
,
who
mitigate
the
fine
to
fifteen
shilling
.
 
<EOS>
during
the
time
the
man
be
wait
for
the
fine
,
this
company
start
off
to
a
public

house
that
we
be
in
the
habit

use
,

wait
for

shortly
after

he
have
break
up
the
company
,
and
that
he
himself
have
lose
five
hundred
pound
in
try
to
overthrow
us
.
 
<EOS>
We
then
take
possession
of
the
hoarding
in
Trafalgar
Square
;
but
Messrs.
Grissell
and
Peto
would
not
allow
us
to
post
our
bill
on
the
say
<EOS>
hoard
without
pay
them

and
from
first
to

Our
discourse
sustain
some
interruption
at
this
point
,
by
the
procession
of
car
occasion
a
stoppage
of
about
three
-
quarter
of
a
mile
in
length
,
as
nearly
as
I
could
judge
.
 
<EOS>
His
Majesty
,
however
,
entreat
me
not
to
be
discompose
by
the
contingent
uproar
,
smoke
with
great
placidity
,
and
survey
the
firmament
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
be
again
in
motion
,
I
beg
to
be
inform
what
be
the
large
poster
His
Majesty
have
ever
see
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
reply
,
"
a
thirty
-
six
sheet
poster
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
gather
,
also
,
that
there
be
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
bill
-
sticker
in
London
,
and
that
His
Majesty
consider
an
average
hand
equal
to
the
posting
of
one
hundred
bill
(
single
sheet
)
in
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
be
of
opinion
,
that
,
although
poster
have
much
increase
in
size
,
they
have
not
increase
in
number
;
as
the
abolition
of
the
State
Lotteries
have
occasion
a
great
fall
off
,
especially
in
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
over
and
above
which
change
,
I
bethink
myself
that
the
custom
of
advertising
in
newspaper
have
greatly
increase
.
 
<EOS>
the
completion
of
many
London
improvement
,
as
Trafalgar
Square

(
I
particularly
observe
the
singularity
of
His
Majesty
's
call
that
an
improvement
)
,
<EOS>
the
Royal
Exchange
,
&
c
,
have
of
late
year
reduce
the
number
of
advantageous
posting
-
place
.
 
<EOS>
Bill
-
Stickers
at
present
rather
confine
themselves
to
district
,
than
to
particular
description
of
work
.
 
<EOS>
one
man
would
strike
over
Whitechapel
,
another
would
take
round
Houndsditch
,
Shoreditch
,
and
the
City
Road
;
one
(
the
King
say
)
would
stick
to
the
Surrey
side
;
another
would
make
a
beat
of
the
west
-
end
.
   
<EOS>
His
Majesty
remark
,
with
some
approach
to
severity
,
on
the
neglect
of
delicacy
and
taste
,
gradually
introduce
into
the
trade
by
the
new
school
:
a
profligate
and
inferior
race
of
impostor
who
take
job
at
almost
any
price
,
to
the
detriment
of
the
old
school
,
and
the
confusion
of
their
own
misguided
employer
.
 
<EOS>
He
consider
that
the
trade
be
overdone
with
competition
,
and
observe
speak
of
his
subject
,
"
there
be
too
many
of
'
em
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
believe
,
still
,
that
thing
be
a
little
well
than
they
have
be
;
adduce
,
as
a
proof
,
the
fact
that
particular
posting
place
be
now
reserve
,
by
common
consent
,
for
particular
poster
;
those
place
,
however
,
must
be
regularly
occupy
by
those
poster
,
or
,
they
lapse
and
fall
into
other
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
of
no
use
give
a
man
a
Drury
Lane
bill
this
week
and
not
next
.
 
<EOS>
where
be
it
to
go
?
 
<EOS>
He
be
of
opinion
that
go
to
the
expense
of
put
up
your
own
board
on
which
your
sticker
could
display
your
own
bill
,
be
the
only
complete
way
of
post
yourself
at
the
present
time
;
but
,
even
to
effect
this
,
on
payment
of
a
shill
a
week
to
the
keeper
of
steamboat
pier
and
other
such
place
,
you
must
be
able
,
besides
,
to
give
order
for
theatre
and
public
exhibition
,
or
you
would
be
sure
to
be
cut
out
by
somebody
.
 
<EOS>
His
Majesty
regard
the
passion
for
order
,
as
one
of
the
most
unappeasable
appetite
of
human
nature
.
 
<EOS>
if
there
be
a
building
,
or
if
there
be
repair
,
go
on
,
anywhere
,
you
could
generally
stand
something
and
make
it
right
with
the
foreman
of
the
work
;
but
,
order
would
be
expect
from
you
,
and
the
man
who
could
give
the
most
order
be
the
man
who
would
come
off
best
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
this
other
objectionable
point
,
in
order
,
that
workman
sell
them
for
drink
,
and
often
sell
them
to
person
who
be
likewise
troubled
with
the
weakness
of
thirst
:
which
lead
(
His
Majesty
say
)
to
the
presentation
of
your
order
at
Theatre
door
,
by
individual
who
be
"
too
shakery
"
to
derive
intellectual
profit
from
the
entertainment
,
and
who
bring
a
scandal
on
you
.
 
<EOS>
finally
,
His
Majesty
say
that
you
could
hardly
put
too
little
in
a
poster
;
what
you
want
,
be
,
two
or
three
good
catch
-
line
for
the
eye
to
rest
on
---
then
,
leave
it
alone
---
and
there
you
be
!
   
<EOS>
these
be
the
minute
of
my
conversation
with
His
Majesty
,
as
I
note
them
down
shortly
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
aware
that
I
have
be
betray
into
any
alteration
or
suppression
.
 
<EOS>
the
manner
of
the
King
be
frank
in
the
extreme
;
and
he
seem
to
me
to
avoid
,
at
once
that
slight
tendency
to
repetition
which
may
have
be
observe
in
the
conversation
of
His
Majesty
King
George
the
third
,
and
---
that
slight
under
-
current
of
egotism
which
the
curious
observer
may
perhaps
detect
in
the
conversation
of
Napoleon
Bonaparte
.
   
<EOS>
I
must
do
the
King
the
justice
to
say
that
it
be
I
,
and
not
he
,
who
close
the
dialogue
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
juncture
,
I
become
the
subject
of
a
remarkable
optical
delusion
;
the
leg
of
my
stool
appear
to
me
to
double
up
;
the
car
to
spin
round
and
round
with
great
violence
;
and
a
mist
to
arise
between
myself
and
His
Majesty
.
 
<EOS>
in
addition
to
these
sensation
,
I
feel
extremely
unwell
.
 
<EOS>
I
refer
these
unpleasant
effect
,
either
to
the
paste
with
which
the
poster
be
affix
to
the
van
:
which
may
have
contain
some
small
portion
of
arsenic
;
or
,
to
the
printer
's
ink
,
which
may
have
contain
some
equally
deleterious
ingredient
.
 
<EOS>
of
this
,
I
can
not
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
only
sure
that
I
be
not
affect
,
either
by
the
smoke
,
or
the
rum
-
and
-
water
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
assist
out
of
the
vehicle
,
in
a
state
of
mind
which
I
have
only
experience
in
two
other
place
<EOS>
---
I
allude
to
the
Pier
at
Dover
,
and
to
the
corresponding
portion
of
the
town
of
Calais
---
and
sit
upon
a
door
-
step
until
I
recover
.
 
<EOS>
the
procession
have
then
disappear
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
since
look
anxiously
for
the
King
in
several
other
car

I
have
not
yet
have
the
happiness
of

when
I

I
drop

I
have
put

in

myself

and
pay
for
it

but
it
look
so
noble
that
it
overpower
me

<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
could

I
take

We
read

no

have
be
expect

I
be

will
go
farther

I
know

I
be

quiet
man

My
constitution
be
tremulous

be
never
loud

,
in
point
of

I
have

the
great
respect

She
be
a
most
remarkable
woman

<EOS>
I
honour
Maria
Jane

Mama

<EOS>
in
my
opinion
she
would
storm
a
town
,
single
-
handed
,
with
a
hearth
-
broom
,
and
carry
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never

her
to
yield
any
point
whatever
,
to
mortal
man
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
calculate
to
terrify
the
stout
heart

<EOS>
still
---
but
I
will
not
anticipate

<EOS>
the
first
intimation
I
have
,
of
any
preparation
be
in
progress
,
on
the
part
of
Maria
Jane
's
Mama
,
be
one
afternoon
,
several
month
ago

<EOS>
I
come
home
earlier
than
usual
from
the
office
,
and
,
proceed
into
the
dining
-
room
,
find
an
obstruction
behind
the

which
prevent
it
from
open
freely

<EOS>
It
be
an
obstruction
of
a
soft
nature

<EOS>
on
look
in
,
I
find
it
to
be
a
female

<EOS>
the
female
in
question
stand
in
the
corner
behind
the
door
,
consume
Sherry
Wine
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
nutty
smell
of
that
beverage
pervade
the
apartment
,
I
have
no
doubt
she
be
consume
a
second
glassful
.
 
<EOS>
She
wear
a
black
bonnet
of
large
dimension
,
and
be
copious
in
figure
.
 
<EOS>
the
expression
of
her
countenance
be
severe
and
discontent
.
 
<EOS>
the
word
to
which
she
give
utterance
on
see
me

be
these

"
oh

be
Mrs

I
immediately
withdraw

of
course

<EOS>
I
be
rather
hurt
,
but
I
make
no
remark

<EOS>
whether
it
be
that
I
show
a
lowness
of
spirit
after
dinner
,
in
consequence
of
feeling
that
I
seem
to
intrude
,
I
can
not

.
 
<EOS>
but
,
Maria
Jane

Mama
say
to
me
on
her
retire
for
the
night
:
in
a
low
distinct
voice
,

with
a
look
of
reproach
that
completely
subdue

:
"

capable
of
deliberate
animosity
towards
a
female
,
so
essential
to
the
welfare
of
Maria
Jane
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
willing
to
admit
that
Fate
may
have
be
to
blame
,
and
not
Mrs
Prodgit
;
but
,
it
be
undeniably
true
,
that
the
latter
female
bring
desolation
and
devastation
into
my
lowly
dwelling
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
happy
after
her
first
appearance
;
we
be
sometimes
exceedingly
so
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
whenever
the
parlour
door
be
open
,
and
"
Mrs
Prodgit
!
"
announce
(
and
she
be
very
often
announce
)
,
misery
ensue
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
Mrs
Prodgit
's
look
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
be
far
from
want
,
and
have
no
business
to
exist
in
Mrs
Prodgit
's
presence
.
 
<EOS>
between
Maria
Jane
's
Mama
,
and
Mrs
Prodgit
,
there
be
a
dreadful
,
secret
,
understanding
---
a
dark
mystery
and
conspiracy
,
point
me
out
as
a
being
to
be
shun
.
 
<EOS>
I
appear
to
have
do
something
that
be
evil
.
 
<EOS>
whenever
Mrs
Prodgit
call
,
after
dinner
,
I
retire
to
my
dressing
-
room
---
where
the
temperature
be
very
low
indeed
,
in
the
wintry
time
of
the
year
---
and
sit
look
at
my
frosty
breath
as
it
rise
before
me
,
and
at
my
rack
of
boot
;
a
serviceable
article
of
furniture
,
but
never
,
in
my
opinion
,
an
exhilarating
object
.
 
<EOS>
the
length
of
the
council
that
be
hold
with
Mrs
Prodgit
,
under
these
circumstance
,
I
will
not
attempt
to
describe
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
merely
remark
,
that
Mrs
Prodgit
always
consume
Sherry
Wine
while
the
deliberation
be
in
progress
;
that
they
always
end
in
Maria
Jane
's
be
in
wretched
spirit
on
the
sofa
;
and
that
Maria
Jane
's
Mama
always
receive
me
,
when
I
be
recall
,
with
a
look
of
desolate
triumph
that
too
plainly
say
,
"
now
,
George
Meek
!
 
<EOS>
You
see
my
child
,
Maria
Jane
,
a
ruin
,
and
I
hope
you
be
satisfied
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
pass
,
generally
,
over
the
period
that
intervene
between
the
day
when
Mrs
Prodgit
enter
her
protest
against
male
party
,
and
the
ever
-
memorable
midnight
when
I
bring
her
to
my
unobtrusive
home
in
a
cab
,
with
an
extremely
large
box
on
the
roof
,
and
a
bundle
,
a
bandbox
,
and
a
basket
,
between
the
driver
's
leg
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
objection
to
Mrs
Prodgit
(
aid
and
abet
by
Mrs
Bigby
,
who
I
never
can
forget
be
the
parent
of
Maria
Jane
)
take
entire
possession
of
my
unassume
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
recess
of
my
own
breast
,
the
thought
may
linger
that
a
man
in
possession
can
not
be
so
dreadful
as
a
woman
,
and
that
woman
Mrs
Prodgit
;
but
,
I
ought
to
bear
a
good
deal
,
and
I
hope
I
can
,
and
do
.
 
<EOS>
Huffing
and
snubbing
,
prey
upon
my
feeling
;
but
,
I
can
bear
them
without
complaint
.
 
<EOS>
They
may
tell
in
the
long
run
;
I
may
be
hustle
about
,
from
post
to
pillar
,
beyond
my
strength
;
nevertheless
,
I
wish
to
avoid
give
rise
to
word
in
the
family
.
   
<EOS>
the
voice
of
Nature
,
however
,
cry
aloud
in
behalf
of
Augustus
George
,
my
infant
son
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
for
him
that
I
wish
to
utter
a
few
plaintive
household
word
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
at
all
angry
;
I
be
mild
---
but
miserable
.
   
<EOS>
I
wish
to
know
why
,
when
my
child
,
Augustus
George
,
be
expect
in
our
circle
,
a
provision
of
pin
be
make

as
if
the
little
stranger
be
a
criminal
who
be
to
be
put
to
the
torture
immediately
,
on
his
arrival
,
instead
of
a
holy
babe

<EOS>
I
wish
to
know
why
haste
be
make
to
stick
those
pin
all
over
his
innocent

in
every
direction
?
 
<EOS>
I
wish
to
be
inform
why
light

air
be
exclude
from
Augustus
George
,
like
poison

<EOS>
why
,
I
ask
,
be
my
unoffending
infant
so
hedge
into
a
basket
-
bedstead
,
with
dimity
and
calico
,
with
miniature
sheet
and
blanket
,
that
I
can
only
hear
him
snuffle
(
and
no
wonder
!
)
<EOS>
deep
down
under
the
pink
hood
of
a
little
bathing
-
machine
,
and
can
never
peruse
even
so
much
of
his
lineament
as
his
nose
?
   
<EOS>
be
I
expect
to
be
the
father
of
a
French
Roll
,
that
the
brush
of
all
Nations

lay
in

to
rasp
Augustus

by
Nature
to
have
rash
bring
out
upon
it
,
by
the
premature
and
incessant
use
of
those
formidable
little
instrument

<EOS>
be
my
son
a
Nutmeg
,
that
he
be
to

grate
on
the
stiff
edge
of
sharp

<EOS>
be
I
the
parent
of
a
Muslin

that

<EOS>
or

all

<EOS>
be
Augustus

<EOS>
I
presume
that
limb

the
intention

then

why

the
pride

duty

<EOS>
yet
,
I
charge
Mrs

(
aid

by
Mrs
Bigby

with
systematically
force
Castor
Oil
on
my
innocent
son
,
from
the
first
hour
of
his
birth
.
 
<EOS>
when
that
medicine
,
in
its
efficient
action
,
cause
internal
disturbance
to
Augustus
George
,
I
charge
Mrs

(
aid

with
insanely

inconsistently
administer
opium
to
allay
the
storm

<EOS>
what
be
the
meaning
of
this
?
   
<EOS>
if
the
day
of
Egyptian
Mummies
be
past

how
dare
Mrs

require
,
for
the
use
of
my
son
,
an
amount
of
flannel
and
linen
that
would
carpet
my

<EOS>
do
I
wonder

she
require
it

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
this
morning
,
within
an
hour

I
beheld
this
agonising
sight

<EOS>
I
beheld
my
son

Augustus
George

in
Mrs

's
hand
,
and
on
Mrs

knee
,
be
dress

<EOS>
He
be
at
the
moment
,
comparatively
speak
,
in
a
state
of
nature
;
have
nothing
on
,
but
an
extremely
short
shirt
,
remarkably
disproportionate
to
the
length
of
his
usual
outer
garment
.
 
<EOS>
trail
from
Mrs

's
lap
,
on
the
floor
,
be
a
long
narrow
roller
or
bandage
---
I
should
say
of
several
yard
in
extent
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
,
I
saw
Mrs
Prodgit
tightly
roll
the
body
of
my
unoffending
infant
,
turn
him
over
and
over
,
now
present
his
unconscious
face
upwards
,
now
the
back
of
his
bald
head
,
until
the
unnatural
feat
be
accomplish
,
and
the
bandage
secure
by
a
pin
,
which
I
have
every
reason
to
believe
enter
the
body
of
my
only
child
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
tourniquet
,
he
pass
the
present
phase
of
his
existence
.
 
<EOS>
Can
I
know
it
,
and
smile
!
   
<EOS>
I
fear
I
have
be
betray
into
express
myself
warmly
,
but
I
feel
deeply
.
 
<EOS>
not
for
myself
;
for
Augustus
George
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
not
interfere
.
 
<EOS>
Will
<EOS>
any
one

<EOS>
Will
any
publication

<EOS>
any
doctor
?
 
<EOS>
any
parent

<EOS>
any

<EOS>
I
do
not
complain
that
Mrs
Prodgit
(
aid
and
abet
by
Mrs
Bigby
)
entirely
alienate
Maria
Jane
's
affection
from
me
,
and
interpose
an
impassable
barrier
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
complain
of
be
make
of
no
account
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
to
be
of
any
account
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
Augustus
George
be
a
production
of
nature
<EOS>
(
I
can
not
think
otherwise
)
,
and
I
claim
that
he
should
be
treat
with
some
remote
reference
to
Nature
.
 
<EOS>
in
my
opinion
,
Mrs
Prodgit
be
,
from
first
to
last
,
a
convention
and
a
superstition
.
 
<EOS>
be
all
the
faculty
afraid
of
Mrs
Prodgit
?
 
<EOS>
if
not
,
why
do
not
they
take
her
in
hand
and
improve
her
?
   
<EOS>
PS
.
 
<EOS>
Maria
Jane
's
Mama
boast
of
her
own
knowledge
of
the
subject
,
and
say
she
bring
up
seven
child
besides
Maria
Jane
.
 
<EOS>
but
how
do
I
know
that
she
may
not
have
bring
them
up
much
better
?
<EOS>
Maria
Jane
herself
be
far
from
strong
,
and
be
subject
to
headache
,
and
nervous
indigestion
.
 
<EOS>
besides
which
,
I
learn
from
the
statistical
table
that
one
child
in
five
die
within
the
first
year
of
its
life
;
and
one
child
in
three
,
within
the
fifth

<EOS>
that
do
not
look
as
if
we
could
never
improve
in
these
particular

I
think

PPS

<EOS>
Augustus
George
be

convulsion

<EOS>
lie
Awake
 
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
lie
with
his
eye
half
closed
,
and
his
nightcap
draw
almost
down
to
his
nose

<EOS>
His
fancy
be
already
wander

begin
to
mingle
up
the
present
scene
with
the
crater
of
Vesuvius
,
the
French
Opera
,
the
Coliseum
at
Rome
,
Dolly

Chop
-
house
in
London
,
and
all
the
farrago
of
note
place
with
which
the
brain
of
a
traveller
be
crammed
;
in
a
word
,
he
be
just
fall
asleep

"
   
<EOS>
thus
,
that
delightful
writer
,
WASHINGTON
IRVING
,
in
his
tale
of
a
traveller
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
it
happen
to
me
the
other
night
to
be
lie
:
not
with
my
eye
half
closed
,
but
with
my
eye
wide
open
;
not
with
my
nightcap
draw
almost
down
to
my
nose
,
for
on
sanitary
principle
I
never
wear
a
nightcap
:
<EOS>
but
with
my
hair
pitchfork
and
touzle
all
over
the
pillow
;
not
just
fall
asleep
by
any
mean
,
but
glaringly
,
persistently
,
and
obstinately
,
broad
awake
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
,
with
no
scientific
intention
or
invention
,
I
be
illustrate
the
theory
of
the
Duality
of
the
Brain
;
perhaps
one
part
of
my
brain
,
be
wakeful
,
sit
up
to
watch
the
other
part
which
be
sleepy
.
 
<EOS>
be
that
as
it
may
,
something
in
me
be
as
desirous
to
go
to
sleep
as
it
possibly
could
be
,
but
something
else
in
me
WOULD
not
go
to
sleep
,
and
be
as
obstinate
as
George
the
Third
.
   
<EOS>
think
of
George
the
Third
---
<EOS>
for
I
devote
this
paper
to
my
train
of
thought
as
I
lay
awake
:
most
people
lie
awake
sometimes
,
and
have
some
interest
in
the
subject
---
put
me
in
mind
of
BENJAMIN
FRANKLIN
,
and
so
Benjamin
Franklin
's
paper
on
the
art
of
procure
pleasant
dream
,
which
would
seem
necessarily
to
include
the
art
of
go
to
sleep
,
come
into
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
as
I
often
use
to
read
that
paper
when
I
be
a
very
small
boy
,
and
as
I
recollect
everything
I
read
then
as
perfectly
as
I
forget
everything
I
read
now
,
I
quote
"
get
out
of
bed
,
beat
up
and
turn
your
pillow
,
shake
the
bed
-
clothe
well
with
at
least
twenty
shake
,
then
throw
the
bed
open
and
leave
it
to
cool
;
in
the
meanwhile
,
continue
undrest
,
walk
about
your
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
when
you
begin
to
feel
the
cold
air
unpleasant
,
then
return
to
your
bed
,
and
you
will
soon
fall
asleep
,
and
your
sleep
will
be
sweet
and
pleasant
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
not
a
bit
of
it
!
 
<EOS>
I
perform
the
whole
ceremony
,
and
if
it
be
possible
for
me
to
be
more
saucer
-
eyed
than
I
be
before
,
that
be
the
only
result
that
come
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
except
Niagara
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
quotation
from
Washington
Irving
and
Benjamin
Franklin
may
have
put
it
in
my
head
by
an
american
association
of
idea
;
but
there
I
be
,
and
the
Horse
-
shoe
Fall
be
thunder
and
tumble
in
my
eye
and
ear
,
and
the
very
rainbow
that
I
leave
upon
the
spray
when
I
really
do
last
look
upon
it
,
be
beautiful
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
the
night
-
light
be
quite
as
plain
,
however
,
and
sleep
seem
to
be
many
thousand
mile
further
off
than
Niagara
,
I
make
up
my
mind
to
think
a
little
about
Sleep
;
which
I
no
sooner
do
than
I
whirl
off
in
spite
of
myself
to
Drury
Lane
Theatre
,
and
there
see
a
great
actor
and
dear
friend
of
mine
(
whom
I
have
be
think
of
in
the
day
)
play
Macbeth
,
and
hear
him
apostrophise
"
the
death
of
each
day
's
life
,
"
as
I
have
hear
him
many
a
time
,
in
the
day
that
be
go
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
Sleep
.
 
<EOS>
I
WILL
think
about
Sleep
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
determined
to
think
(
this
be
the
way
I
go
on
)
about
Sleep
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
hold
the
word
Sleep
,
tight
and
fast
,
or
I
shall
be
off
at
a
tangent
in
half
a
second
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
myself
unaccountably
stray
,
already
,
into
Clare
Market
.
 
<EOS>
Sleep
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
curious
,
as
illustrate
the
equality
of
sleep
,
to
inquire
how
many
of
its
phenomenon
be
common
to
all
class
,
to
all
degree
of
wealth
and
poverty
,
to
every
grade
of
education
and
ignorance
.

for
example

Majesty
Queen

one
of
her
Majesty
's
jail
.
<EOS>
Her
Majesty
have
fall
,
many
thousand
of
time
,
from
that
same
Tower
,
which
I
claim
a
right
to
tumble
off
now
and
then

<EOS>
so
have
Winking
Charley
.
 
<EOS>
Her
Majesty
in
her
sleep
have
open
or
prorogue
Parliament
,
or
have
hold
a
Drawing
Room
,
attire
in
some
very
scanty
dress
,
the
deficiency
and
impropriety
of
which
have
cause
her
great
uneasiness
.
 
<EOS>
I
,
in
my
degree
,
have
suffer
unspeakable
agitation
of
mind
from
take
the
chair
at
a
public
dinner
at
the
London
Tavern
in
my
night
-
clothe
,
which
not
all
the
courtesy
of
my
kind
friend

MR

<EOS>
BATHE
could
persuade
me
be
quite
adapt
to
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
Winking
Charley
have
be
repeatedly
try
in
a
bad
condition
.
 
<EOS>
Her
Majesty
be
no
stranger
to
a
vault
or
firmament
,
of
a
sort
of
floorcloth
,
with
an
indistinct
pattern
distantly
resemble
eye
,
which
occasionally
obtrude
itself
on
her
repose
.
 
<EOS>
neither
be

neither
be
Winking

<EOS>
It
be
quite
common
to
all
three
of
us
to
skim
along
with
airy
stride
a
little
above
the
ground
;
also
to
hold
,
with
the
deep
interest
,
dialogue
with
various
people
,
all
represent
by
ourselves
;
and
to
be
at
our
wit
's
end
to
know
what
they
be
go
to
tell
us
;
and
to
be
indescribably
astonish
by
the
secret
they
disclose
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
probable
that
we
have
all
three
committed
murder
and
hide
body
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
pretty
certain
that
we
have
all
desperately
want
to
cry
out
,
and
have
have
no
voice
;
that
we
have
all
go
to
the
play
and
not
be
able
to
get
in
;
that
we
have
all
dream
much
more
of
our
youth
than
of
our
later
life
;
that
---
I
have
lose
it
!
<EOS>
the
thread
be
break
.
   
<EOS>
and
up
I
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
,
lie
here
with
the
night
-
light
before
me
,
up
I
go
,
for
no
reason
on
earth
that
I
can
find
out
,
and
draw
by
no
link
that
be
visible
to
me
,
up
the
Great
Saint
Bernard
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
live
in
Switzerland
,
and
ramble
among
the
mountain
;
but
,
why
I
should
go
there
now
,
and
why
up
the
Great
Saint
Bernard
in
preference
to
any
other
mountain
,
I
have
no
idea
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
lie
here
broad
awake
,
and
with
every
sense
so
sharpened
that
I
can
distinctly
hear
distant
noise
inaudible
to
me
at
another
time
,
I
make
that
journey
,
as
I
really
do
,
on
the
same
summer
day
,
with
the
same
happy
party
---
ah
!
<EOS>
two
since
dead
,
I
grieve
to
think
---
and
there
be
the
same
track
,
with
the
same
black
wooden
arm
to
point
the
way
,
and
there
be
the
same
storm
-
refuge
here
and
there
;
and
there
be
the
same
snow
fall
at
the
top
,
and
there
be
the
same
frosty
mist
,
and
there
be
the
same
intensely
cold
convent
with
its
menagerie
smell
,
and
the
same
breed
of
dog
fast
die
out
,
and
the
same
breed
of
jolly
young
monk
whom
I
mourn
to
know
as
humbug
,
and
the
same
convent
parlour
with
its
piano
and
the
sitting
round
the
fire
,
and
the
same
supper
,
and
the
same
lone
night
in
a
cell
,
and
the
same
bright
fresh
morning
when
go
out
into
the
highly
rarefied
air
be
like
a
plunge
into
an
icy
bath
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
see
here
what
come
along
;
and
why
do
this
thing
stalk
into
my
mind
on
the
top
of
a
swiss
mountain
!
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
figure
that
I
once
see
,
just
after
dark
,
chalk
upon
a
door
in
a
little
back
lane
near
a
country
church
---
my
first
church
.
<EOS>
how
young
a
child
<EOS>
I
may
have
be
at
the
time
I
do
not
know
,
but
it
horrify
me
so
intensely
---
in
connexion
with
the
churchyard
,
I
suppose
,
for
it
smoke
a
pipe
,
and
have
a
big
hat
with
each
of
its
ear
stick
out
in
a
horizontal
line
under
the
brim
,
and
be
not
in
itself
more
oppressive
than
a
mouth
from
ear
to
ear
,
a
pair
of
goggle
eye
,
and
hand
like
two
bunche
of
carrot
,
five
in
each
,
can
make
it
---
that
it
be
still
vaguely
alarming
to
me
to
recall
(
as
I
have
often
do
before
,
lie
awake
)
<EOS>
the
run
home
,
the
look
behind
,
the
horror
,
of
its
follow
me
;
though
whether
disconnect
from
the
door
,
or
door
and
all
,
I
can
not
say
,
and
perhaps
never
could
.
 
<EOS>
It
lay
a
disagreeable
train
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
resolve
to
think
of
something
on
the
voluntary
principle
.
   
<EOS>
the
balloon
ascent
of
this
last
season
.
 
<EOS>
They
will
do
to
think
about
,
while
I
lie
awake
,
as
well
as
anything
else
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
hold
them
tight
though
,
for
I
feel
them
slide
away
,
and
in
their
stead
be
the
manning
,
husband
and
wife
,
hang
on
the
top
of
Horse
-
monger
Lane
Jail
.
 
<EOS>
in
connexion
with
which
dismal
spectacle
,
I
recall
this
curious
fantasy
of
the
mind
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
have
beheld
that
execution
,
and
have
leave
those
two
form
dangle
on
the
top
of
the
entrance
gateway
---
the
man
's
,
a
limp
,
loose
suit
of
clothe
as
if
the
man
have
go
out
of
them
;
the
woman
's
,
a
fine
shape
,
so
elaborately
corset
and
artfully
dress
,
that
it
be
quite
unchanged
in
its
trim
appearance
as
it
slowly
swing
from
side
to
side
---
<EOS>
I
never
could
,
by
my
uttermost
effort
,
for
some
week
,
present
the
outside
of
that
prison
to
myself
(
which
the
terrible
impression
I
have
receive
continually
oblige
me
to
do
)
without
present
it
with
the
two
figure
still
hang
in
the
morning
air
.
 
<EOS>
until
,
stroll
past
the
gloomy
place
one
night
,
when
the
street
be
desert
and
quiet
,
and
actually
see
that
the
body
be
not
there
,
my
fancy
be
persuade
,
as
it
be
,
to
take
them
down
and
bury
them
within
the
precinct
of
the
jail
,
where
they
have
lain
ever
since
.
   
<EOS>
the
balloon
ascent
of
last
season
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
reckon
them
up
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
horse
,
the
bull
,
the
parachute
,
---
and
the
tumbler
hang
on
---
chiefly
by
his
toe
,
I
believe
---
below
the
car
.
 
<EOS>
very
wrong
,
indeed
,
and
decidedly
to
be
stop
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
in
connexion
with
these
and
similar
dangerous
exhibition
,
it
strike
me
that
that
portion
of
the
public
whom
they
entertain
,
be
unjustly
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
Their
pleasure
be
in
the
difficulty
overcome
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
a
public
of
great
faith
,
and
be
quite
confident
that
the
gentleman
will
not
fall
off
the
horse
,
or
the
lady
off
the
bull
or
out
of
the
parachute
,
and
that
the
tumbler
have
a
firm
hold
with
his
toe
.
 
<EOS>
They
do
not
go
to
see
the
adventurer
vanquish
,
but
triumphant
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
parallel
in
public
combat
between
man
and
beast
,
because
nobody
can
answer
for
the
particular
beast
---
unless
it
be
always
the
same
beast
,
in
which
case
it
would
be
a
mere
stage
-
show
,
which
the
same
public
would
go
in
the
same
state
of
mind
to
see
,
entirely
believe
in
the
brute
be
beforehand
safely
subdue
by
the
man
.
<EOS>
that
they
be
not
accustom
to
calculate
hazard
and
danger
with
any
nicety
,
we
may
know
from
their
rash
exposure
of
themselves
in
overcrowded
steamboat
,
and
unsafe
conveyance
and
place
of
all
kind
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
can
not
help
think
that
instead
of
rail
,
and
attribute
savage
motive
to
a
people
naturally
well
disposed
and
humane
,
it
be
well
to
teach
them
,
and
lead
them
argumentatively
and
reasonably
---
for
they
be
very
reasonable
,
if
you
will
discuss
a
matter
with
them
---
to
more
considerate
and
wise
conclusion
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
a
disagreeable
intrusion
!
 
<EOS>
here
be
a
man
with
his
throat
cut
,
dash
towards
me
as
I
lie
awake
!
 
<EOS>
a
recollection
of
an
old
story
of
a
kinsman
of
mine
,
who
,
go
home
one
foggy
winter
night
to
Hampstead
,
when
London
be
much
small
and
the
road
lonesome
,
suddenly
encounter
such
a
figure
rush
past
him
,
and
presently
two
keeper
from
a
madhouse
in
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
a
very
unpleasant
creature
indeed
,
to
come
into
my
mind
unbidden
,
as
I
lie
awake
.
   
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
the
balloon
ascent
of
last
season
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
return
to
the
balloon
.
 
<EOS>
why
do
the
bleed
man
start
out
of
them
?
 
<EOS>
never
mind
;
if
I
inquire
,
he
will
be
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
the
balloon
.
 
<EOS>
this
particular
public
have
inherently
a
great
pleasure
in
the
contemplation
of
physical
difficulty
overcome
;
mainly
,
as
I
take
it
,
because
the
life
of
a
large
majority
of
them
be
exceedingly
monotonous
and
real
,
and
further
,
be
a
struggle
against
continual
difficulty
,
and
further
still
,
because
anything
in
the
form
of
accidental
injury
,
or
any
kind
of
illness
or
disability
be
so
very
serious
in
their
own
sphere
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
explain
this
seem
paradox
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
take
the
case
of
a
Christmas
Pantomime
.
 
<EOS>
surely
nobody
suppose
that
the
young
mother
in
the
pit
who
fall
into
fit
of
laughter
when
the
baby
be
boil
or
sit
upon
,
would
be
at
all
divert
by
such
an
occurrence
off
the
stage
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
the
decent
workman
in
the
gallery
,
who
be
transport
beyond
the
ignorant
present
by
the
delight
with
which
he
see
a
stout
gentleman
push
out
of
a
two
pair
of
stair
window
,
to
be
slander
by
the
suspicion
that
he
would
be
in
the
least
entertain
by
such
a
spectacle
in
any
street
in
London
,
Paris
,
or
New
York
.
 
<EOS>
It
always
appear
to
me
that
the
secret
of
this
enjoyment
lie
in
the
temporary
superiority
to
the
common
hazard
and
mischance
of
life
;
in
see
casualty
,
attend
when
they
really
occur
with
bodily
and
mental
suffering
,
tear
,
and
poverty
,
happen
through
a
very
rough
sort
of
poetry
without
the
least
harm
be
do
to
any
one
---
the
pretence
of
distress
in
a
pantomime
be
so
broadly
humorous
as
to
be
no
pretence
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
much
as
in
the
comic
fiction
I
can
understand
the
mother
with
a
very
vulnerable
baby
at
home
,
greatly
relish
the
invulnerable
baby
on
the
stage
,
so
in
the
cremorne
reality
I
can
understand
the
mason
who
be
always
liable
to
fall
off
a
scaffold
in
his
work
jacket
and
to
be
carry
to
the
hospital
,
have
an
infinite
admiration
of
the
radiant
personage
in
spangle
who
go
into
the
cloud
upon
a
bull
,
or
upside
down
,
and
who
,
he
take
it
for
grant
---
not
reflect
upon
the
thing
---
have
,
by
uncommon
skill
and
dexterity
,
conquer
such
mischance
as
those
to
which
he
and
his
acquaintance
be
continually
expose
.
   
<EOS>
I
wish
the
Morgue
in
Paris
would
not
come
here
as
I
lie
awake
,
with
its
ghastly
bed
,
and
the
swollen
saturate
clothe
hang
up
,
and
the
water
drip
,
<EOS>
drip
all
day
long
,
upon
that
other
swollen
saturate
something
in
the
corner
,
like
a
heap
of
crush
over
-
ripe
fig
that
I
have
see
in
Italy
!
 
<EOS>
and
this
detestable
Morgue
come
back
again
at
the
head
of
a
procession
of
forget
ghost
story
.
<EOS>
this
will
never
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
think
of
something
else
as
I
lie
awake
;
or
,
like
that
sagacious
animal
in
the
United
States
who
recognise
the
colonel
who
be
such
a
dead
shot
,
I
be
a
gone
'
Coon
.
 
<EOS>
what
shall
I
think
of
?
 
<EOS>
the
late
brutal
assault
.
 
<EOS>
very
good
subject
.
<EOS>
the
late
brutal
assault
.
   
<EOS>
(
though
whether
,
suppose
I
should
see
,
here
before
me
as
I
lie
awake
,
the
awful
phantom
describe
in
one
of
those
ghost
story
,
who
,
with
a
head
-
dress
of
shroud
,
be
always
see
look
in
through
a
certain
glass
door
at
a
certain
dead
hour
---
whether
,
in
such
a
case
it
would
be
the
least
consolation
to
me
to
know
on
philosophical
ground
that
it
be
merely
my
imagination
,
be
a
question
I
can
not
help
ask
myself
by
the
way
.
)
   
<EOS>
the
late
brutal
assault
.
 
<EOS>
I
strongly
question
the
expediency
of
advocate
the
revival
of
whip
for
those
crime
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
natural
and
generous
impulse
to
be
indignant
at
the
perpetration
of
inconceivable
brutality
,
but
I
doubt
the
whip
panacea
gravely
.
<EOS>
not
in
the
least
regard
or
pity
for
the
criminal
,
whom
I
hold
in
far
low
estimation
than
a
mad
wolf
,
but
in
consideration
for
the
general
tone
and
feeling
,
which
be
very
much
improve
since
the
whipping
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
bad
for
a
people
to
be
familiarise
with
such
punishment
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
whip
go
out
of
Bridewell
,
and
cease
to
be
flourish
at
the
cart
tail
and
at
the
whipping
-
post
,
it
begin
to
fade
out
of
madhouse
,
and
workhouse
,
and
school
and
family
,
and
to
give
place
to
a
well
system
everywhere
,
than
cruel
driving
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
hasty
,
because
a
few
brute
may
be
inadequately
punish
,
to
revive
,
in
any
aspect
,
what
,
in
so
many
aspect
,
society
be
hardly
yet
happily
rid
of
.
 
<EOS>
the
whip
be
a
very
contagious
kind
of
thing
,
and
difficult
to
confine
within
one
set
of
bound
.
 
<EOS>
utterly
abolish
punishment
by
fine
---
a
barbarous
device
,
quite
as
much
out
of
date
as
wager
by
battle
,
but
particularly
connect
in
the
vulgar
mind
with
this
class
of
offence
---
at
least
quadruple
the
term
of
imprisonment
for
aggravated
assault
---
and
above
all
let
us
,
in
such
case
,
have
no
Pet
Prisoning
,
vain
glorifying
,
strong
soup
,
and
roast
meat
,
but
hard
work
,
and
one
unchanging
and
uncompromising
dietary
of
bread
and
water
,
well
or
ill
;
and
we
shall
do
much
better
than
by
go
down
into
the
dark
to
grope
for
the
whip
among
the
rusty
fragment
of
the
rack
,
and
the
branding
iron

and
the
chain
and
gibbet
from
the
public
road
,
and
the
weight
that
press
man
to
death
in
the
cell
of
Newgate
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
proceed
thus
far
,
when
I
find
I
have
be
lie
awake
so
long
that
the
very
dead
begin
to
wake
too
,
and
to
crowd
into
my
thought
most
sorrowfully
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
I
resolve
to
lie
awake
no
more
,
but
to
get
up
and
go
out
for
a
night
walk
---
which
resolution
be
an
acceptable
relief
to
me
,
as
I
dare
say
it
may
prove
now
to
a
great
many
more
.
    
<EOS>
the
Ghost

<EOS>
I
be
a
bachelor
,
reside
in
rather
a
dreary
set
of
chamber
in
the
Temple
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
situate
in
a
square
court
of
high
house
,
which
would
be
a
complete
well
,
but
for
the
want
of
water
and
the
absence
of
a
bucket
.
 
<EOS>
I
live
at
the
top
of
the
house
,
among
the
tile
and
sparrow
.
 
<EOS>
like
the
little
man
in
the
nursery
-
story
,
I
live
by
myself
,
and
all
the
bread
and
cheese
I
get
---
which
be
not
much
---
I
put
upon
a
shelf
.
 
<EOS>
I
need
scarcely
add
,
perhaps
,
that
I
be
in
love
,
and
that
the
father
of
my
charming
Julia
object
to
our
union
.
   
<EOS>
I
mention
these
little
particular
as
I
may
deliver
a
letter
of
introduction
.
 
<EOS>
the
reader
be
now
acquaint
with
me
,
and
perhaps
will
condescend
to
listen
to
my
narrative
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
naturally
of
a
dreamy
turn
of
mind
;
and
my
abundant
leisure
---
for
I
be
call
to
the
Bar
---
couple
with
much
lonely
listening
to
the
twittering
of
sparrow
,
and
the
pattering
of
rain
,
have
encourage
that
disposition
.
 
<EOS>
in
my
"
top
set
"
<EOS>
I
hear
the
wind
howl
on
a
winter
night
,
when
the
man
on
the
ground
floor
believe
it
be
perfectly
still
weather
.
 
<EOS>
the
dim
lamp
with
which
our
honourable
Society
(
suppose
to
be
as
yet
unconscious
of
the
new
discovery
call
Gas
)
make
the
horror
of
the
staircase
visible
,
deepen
the
gloom
which
generally
settle
on
my
soul
when
I
go
home
at
night
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
in
the
Law
,
but
not
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
exactly
make
out
what
it
mean
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
in
Westminster
Hall
sometimes
(
in
character
)
from
ten
to
four
;
and
when
I
go
out
of
Court
,
I
do
not
know
whether
I
be
stand
on
my
wig
or
my
boot
.
   
<EOS>
It
appear
to
me
(
I
mention
this
in
confidence
)
as
if
there
be
too
much
talk
and
too
much
law
---
as
if
some
grain
of
truth
be
start
overboard
into
a
tempestuous
sea
of
chaff
.
   
<EOS>
all
this
may
make
me
mystical
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
I
be
confident
that
what
I
be
go
to
describe
myself
as
have
see
and
hear
,
I
actually
do
see
and
hear
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
that
I
should
observe
that
I
have
a
great
delight
in
picture
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
no
painter
myself
,
but
I
have
study
picture
and
write
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
all
the
most
famous
picture
in
the
world
;
my
education
and
reading
have
be
sufficiently
general
to
possess
me
beforehand
with
a
knowledge
of
most
of
the
subject
to
which
a
painter
be
likely
to
have
recourse
;
and
,
although
I
may
be
in
some
doubt
as
to
the
rightful
fashion
of
the
scabbard
of
King
Lear
's
sword
,
for
instance
,
I
think
I
should
know
King
Lear
tolerably
well
,
if
I
happen
to
meet
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
I
go
to
all
the
Modern
Exhibitions
every
season
,
and
of
course
I
revere
the
Royal
Academy
.
 
<EOS>
I
stand
by
its
forty
academical
article
almost
as
firmly
as
I
stand
by
the
thirty
-
nine
Articles
of
the
Church
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
convinced
that
in
neither
case
could
there
be
,
by
any
rightful
possibility
,
one
article
more
or
less
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
now
exactly
three
year
---
three
year
ago
,
this
very
month
---
since
I
go
from
Westminster
to
the
Temple
,
one
Thursday
afternoon
,
in
a
cheap
steamboat
.
 
<EOS>
the
sky
be
black
,
when
I
imprudently
walk
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
It
begin
to
thunder
and
lighten
immediately
afterwards
,
and
the
rain
pour
down
in
torrent
.
 
<EOS>
the
deck
seem
to
smoke
with
the
wet
,
I
go
below
;
but
so
many
passenger
be
there
,
smoke
too
,
that
I
come
up
again
,
and
button
my
pea
-
coat
,
and
stand
in
the
shadow
of
the
paddle
-
box
,
stand
as
upright
as
I
could
,
and
make
the
good
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
at
this
moment
that
I
first
beheld
the
terrible
being
,
who
be
the
subject
of
my
present
recollection
.
   
<EOS>
stand
against
the
funnel
,
apparently
with
the
intention
of
dry
himself
by
the
heat
as
fast
as
he
get
wet
,
be
a
shabby
man
in
threadbare
black
,
and
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
who
fascinate
me
from
the
memorable
instant
when
I
catch
his
eye
.
   
<EOS>
where
have
I
catch
that
eye
before
?
 
<EOS>
who
be
he
?
 
<EOS>
why
do
I
connect
him
,
all
at
once
,
with
the
Vicar
of
Wakefield
,
Alfred
the
great
,
Gil
Blas
,
Charles
the
second
,
Joseph
and
his
Brethren
,
the
Fairy
Queen
,
Tom
Jones
,
the
Decameron
of
Boccaccio
,
Tam
O'Shanter
,
the
marriage
of
the
Doge
of
Venice
with
the
Adriatic
,
and
the
Great
Plague
of
London
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
when
he
bend
one
leg
,
and
place
one
hand
upon
the
back
of
the
seat
near
him
,
do
my
mind
associate
him
wildly
with
the
word
,
"
number
one
hundred
and
forty
-
two
,
Portrait
of
a
gentleman
"
?
 
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
I
be
go
mad
?
   
<EOS>
I
look
at
him
again
,
and
now
I
could
have
take
my
affidavit
that
he
belong
to
the
Vicar
of
Wakefield
's
family
.
 
<EOS>
whether
he
be
the
Vicar
,
or
Moses
,
or
Mr
Burchill
,
or
the
Squire
,
or
a
conglomeration
of
all
four
,
I
know
not
;
but
I
be
impel
to
seize
him
by
the
throat
,
and
charge
him
with
be
,
in
some
fell
way
,
connect
with
the
Primrose
blood
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
up
at
the
rain
,
and
<EOS>
then
---
oh
Heaven
!
---
he
become
Saint
John
.
 
<EOS>
He
fold
his
arm
,
resign
himself
to
the
weather
,
and
I
be
frantically
incline
to
address
him
as
the
Spectator
,
and
firmly
demand
to
know
what
he
have
do
with
Sir
Roger
de
Coverley
.
   
<EOS>
the
frightful
suspicion
that
I
be
become
derange
,
return
upon
me
with
redouble
force
.
 
<EOS>
meantime
,
this
awful
stranger
,
inexplicably
link
to
my
distress
,
stand
dry
himself
at
the
funnel
;
and
ever
,
as
the
steam
rise
from
his
clothe
,
diffuse
a
mist
around
him
,
I
see
through
the
ghostly
medium
all
the
people
I
have
mention
,
and
a
score
more
,
sacred
and
profane
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
conscious
of
a
dreadful
inclination
that
steal
upon
me
,
as
it
thunder
and
lighten
,
to
grapple
with
this
man
,
or
demon
,
and
plunge
him
over
the
side
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
I
constrain
myself
---
I
know
not
how
---
to
speak
to
him
,
and
in
a
pause
of
the
storm
,
I
cross
the
deck
,
and
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
what
be
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
reply
,
hoarsely
,
"
a
Model

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
a
what

"
say
I.
   
<EOS>

<EOS>

<EOS>
(
all
through
this
narrative
I
give
his
own
word
,
which
be
indelibly
imprint
on
my
memory
.
)
   
<EOS>
the
relief
which
this
disclosure
give
me
,
the
exquisite
delight
of
the
restoration
of
my
confidence
in
my
own
sanity
,
I
can
not
describe

I
should
have
fall
on

the
consciousness
of

the
man
at
the
wheel

<EOS>
"
You

I

warmly

of
thunder
and
lightning

that
by
which
I

except
that
this
storm
,
burst
over
the
town
at
midnight
,
be
render
much
more
awful
by
the
darkness
and
the
hour
.
   
<EOS>
as
I
turn
into
my
court
,
I
really
think
a
thunderbolt
would
fall
,
and
plough
the
pavement
up
.
 
<EOS>
every
brick
and
stone
in
the
place
seem
to
have
an
echo
of
its
own
for
the
thunder
.
 
<EOS>
the
waterspout
be
overcharge
,
and
the
rain
come
tear
down

Mrs
Parkins
,
my
laundress
---
wife
of
Parkins
<EOS>
the
porter
,
then
newly
dead
of
a
dropsy
---
have
particular
instruction
to
place
a
bedroom
candle
and
a
match
under
the
staircase
lamp
on
my
landing
,
in
order
that
I
may
light
my
candle
there
,
whenever
I
come
home
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Parkins
invariably
disregard
all
instruction
,
they
be
never
there
.
 
<EOS>
thus
it
happen
that
on
this
occasion
I
grope
my
way
into
my
sitting
-
room
to
find
the
candle
,
and
come
out
to
light
it
.
   
<EOS>
what
be
my
emotion
when
,
underneath
the
staircase
lamp
,
shine
with
wet
as
if
he
have
never
be
dry
since
our
last
meeting
,
stand
the
mysterious
being
whom
I
have
encounter
on
the
steamboat
in
a
thunderstorm
,
two
year
before
!
 
<EOS>
His
prediction
rush
upon
my
mind
,
and
I
turn
faint
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
I
would
do
it
,
"
he
observe
,
in
a
hollow
voice
,
"
and
I
have
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
come
in
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
misguided
creature
,
what
have
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
I
return
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
let
you
know
,
"
be
his
reply
,
"
if
you
will
let
me
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
Could
it
be
murder
that
he
have
do
?
 
<EOS>
and
have
he
be
so
successful
that
he
want
to
do
it
again
,
at
my
expense
?
   
<EOS>
I
hesitate
.
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
come
in
?
"
say
he
.
   
<EOS>
I
incline
my
head
,
with
as
much
presence
of
mind
as
I
could
command
,
and
he
follow
me
into
my
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
I
see
that
the
low
part
of
his
face
be
tie
up
,
in
what
be
commonly
call
a
Belcher
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
He
slowly
remove
this
bandage
,
and
expose
to
view
a
long
dark
beard
,
curl
over
his
upper
lip
,
twist
about
the
corner
of
his
mouth
,
and
hang
down
upon
his
breast
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
this
?
<EOS>
"
I
exclaim
involuntarily
,
"
and
what
have
you
become
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
the
Ghost
of
art
!
"
say
he
.
   
<EOS>
the
effect
of
these
word
,
slowly
uttered
in
the
thunder
-
storm
at
midnight
,
be
appalling
in
the
last
degree
.
 
<EOS>
more
dead
than
alive
,
I
survey
him
in
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
the
german
taste
come
up
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
throw
me
out
of
bread
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
ready
for
the
taste
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
make
his
beard
a
little
jagged
with
his
hand
,
fold
his
arm
,
and
say
,
   
"
severity
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
shudder
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
severe
.
   
<EOS>
He
make
his
beard
flow
on
his
breast
,
and
,
lean
both
hand
on
the
staff
of
a
carpet
-
broom
which
Mrs
Parkins
have
leave
among
my
book
,
say
:
   
"
Benevolence

"
   
<EOS>
I
stand
transfixed
.
 
<EOS>
the
change
of
sentiment
be
entirely
in
the
beard
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
may
have
leave
his
face
alone
,
or
have
no
face
.
   
<EOS>
the
beard
do
everything

<EOS>
He
lie
down
,
on
his
back
,
on
my
table
,
and
with
that
action
of
his
head
throw
up
his
beard
at
the
chin
.
   
<EOS>
"
that

<EOS>
He
get
off
my
table
and
,
look
up
at
the
ceiling
,
cock
his
beard
a
little
awry
;
at
the

make
it
stick
out
before
him

<EOS>
"
adoration
,
or
a
vow
of
vengeance

"
he
observe
.
   
<EOS>
He
turn
his
profile
to
me
,
make
his
upper
lip
very
bulky
with
the
upper
part
of
his
beard
.
   
<EOS>
"
romantic
character

"
say
he
.
   
<EOS>
He
look
sideways
out
of
his
beard
,
as

it
be
an
ivy

bush
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Jealousy
,
"
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
it
an
ingenious
twist
in
the
air
,
and
inform
me
that
he
be
carouse
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
it
shaggy
with
his
finger
---
and
it
be
Despair
;
lank
---
and
<EOS>
it
be
avarice
:
<EOS>
toss
it
all
kind

<EOS>
He
may
have
tumble
down

stair
in
the
dark

but
he
never
walk
down
or

<EOS>
I
look
over

I
be
alone
with
the
thunder

need
I

It

<EOS>
it

terror
at

go

out

Sitting

on

bright
September
morning

among
my
book

paper
at
my
open
window
on
the
cliff
overhang
the
sea
-
beach
,
I
have
the
sky
and
ocean
frame
before
me
like
a
beautiful
picture
.
 
<EOS>
a
beautiful
picture
,
but
with
such
movement
in
it
,
such
change
of
light
upon
the
sail
of
ship
and
wake
of
steamboat
,
such
dazzling
gleam
of
silver
far
out
at
sea
,
such
fresh
touch
on
the
crisp
wave
-
top
as
they
break
and
roll
towards
me
---
a
picture
with
such
music
in
the
billowy
rush
upon
the
shingle
,
the
blowing
of
morning
wind
through
the
corn
-
sheaf
where
the
farmer
'
waggon
be
busy
,
the
singing
of
the
lark
,
and
the
distant
voice
of
child
at
play
---
such
charm
of
sight
and
sound
as
all
the
Galleries
on
earth
can
but
poorly
suggest
.
   
<EOS>
so
dreamy
be
the
murmur
of
the
sea
below
my
window
,
that
I
may
have
be
here
,
for
anything
I
know
,
one
hundred
year

<EOS>
not
that
I
have
grow
old
,
for
,
daily
on
the
neighbouring
down

grassy
hill

side
<EOS>
,
I
find
that
I
can
still
in
reason
walk
any
distance
,
jump
over
anything
,
and
climb
up
anywhere
;
but
,
that
the
sound
of
the
ocean
seem
to
have
become
so
customary
to
my
musing
,
and
other
reality
seem
so
to
have
go
aboard
ship
and
float
away
over
the
horizon
,
that
,
for
aught
I
will
undertake
to
the
contrary
,
I
be
the
enchanted
son
of
the
King
my
father
,
shut
up
in
a
tower
on
the
sea
-
shore
,
for
protection
against
an
old
she

goblin
who
insist
on
be
my
godmother

who
foresaw
at
the
font
---
wonderful
creature

<EOS>
---
that
I
should
get
into
a
scrape
before
I
be
twenty

one

<EOS>
I
remember
to
have
be
in
a
City
(
my
Royal
parent
's
dominion
,
I
suppose
)
,
and
apparently
not
long
ago
either
,
that
be
in
the
dreary
condition
.
 
<EOS>
the
principal
inhabitant
have
all
be
change
into
old
newspaper
,
and
in
that
form
be
preserve
their
window
-
blind
from
dust
,
and
wrap
all
their
small
household
god
in
curl
-
paper
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk
through
gloomy
street
where
every
house
be
shut
up
and
newspapere
,
and
where
my
solitary
footstep
echo
on
the
desert
pavement
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
public
ride
there
be
no
carriage
,
no
horse
,
no
animate
existence
,
but
a
few
sleepy
policeman
,
and
a
few
adventurous
boy
take
advantage
of
the
devastation
to
swarm
up
the
lamp
-
post
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
Westward
street
there
be
no
traffic
;
in
the
Westward
shop
,
no
business
.
 
<EOS>
the
water

pattern
which
the

prentice
have
trickle
out
on
the
pavement
early
in
the
morning
,
remain
uneffaced
by
human
foot

<EOS>
at
the
corner
of
mews
,
Cochin

China
fowl
stalk
gaunt
and
savage

nobody

<EOS>
Public
Houses

splendid

swinge
their

over
gorgeous

cloth
beside

coachman
be

be
silent

and
the
unused
pewter
pot
shone
,
too
bright
for

,
on
the

.
 
<EOS>
I
beheld
a
Punch

Show
lean
against
a
wall
near
Park
Lane
,
as
if
it
have
faint

<EOS>
It
be
desert
,
and
there
be
none
to
heed
its
desolation
.
 
<EOS>
in
Belgrave
Square
I
meet
the
last
man
---
an
ostler
---
sit
on
a
post
in
a
ragged
red
waistcoat
,
eat
straw
,
and
mildew
away
.
   
<EOS>
if
I
recollect
the
name
of
the
little
town
,
on
whose
shore
this
sea
be
murmur
---
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
just
now
,
as
I
have
premise
,
to
be
rely
upon
for
anything
---
it
be
Pavilionstone
.
 
<EOS>
within
a
quarter
of
a
century
,
it
be
a
little
fishing
town
,
and
they
do
say
,
that
the
time
be
,
when
it
be
a
little
smuggling
town
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
hear
that
it
be
rather
famous
in
the
holland
and
brandy
way
,
and
that
coevally
with
that
reputation
the
lamplighter
's
be
consider
a
bad
life
at
the
Assurance
Offices
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
observe
that
if
he
be
not
particular
about
light
up
,
he
live
in
peace
;
but
that
,
if
he
make
the
good
of
the
oil
-
lamp
in
the
steep
and
narrow
street
,
he
usually
fall
over
the
cliff
at
an
early
age
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
gas
and
electricity
run
to
the
very
water
's
edge
,
and
the
South
-
Eastern
Railway
Company
screech
at
us
in
the
dead
of
night
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
the
old
little
fishing
and
smuggling
town
remain
,
and
be
so
tempt
a
place
for
the
latter
purpose
,
that
I
think
of
go
out
some
night
next
week
,
in
a
fur
cap
and
a
pair
of
petticoat
trouser
,
and
run
an
empty
tub
,
as
a
kind
of
archaeological
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
let
nobody
with
corn
come
to
Pavilionstone
,
for
there
be
breakneck
flight
of
ragged
step
,
connect
the
principal
street
by
back
-
way
,
which
will
cripple
that
visitor
in
half
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
the
way
by
which
,
when
I
run
that
tub
,
I
shall
escape
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
make
a
Thermopylae
of
the
corner
of
one
of
them
,
defend
it
with
my
cutlass
against
the
coast
-
guard
until
my
brave
companion
have
sheer
off
,
then
dive
into
the
darkness
,
and
regain
my
Susan
's
arm
.
 
<EOS>
in
connection
with
these
breakneck
step
I
observe
some
wooden
cottage
,
with
tumble
-
down
out

house
,
and
back
-
yard
three
foot
square
,
adorn
with
garland
of
dry
fish
,
in
one
of
which
(
though
the
General
Board
of
Health
may
object
)
<EOS>
my

dwell
.
   
<EOS>
the
South

Eastern
Company
have
bring
Pavilionstone
into
such
vogue
,
with
their
tidal
train
and
splendid
steam

packet
,
that
a
new
Pavilionstone
be
rise
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
,
myself
,
of
New
Pavilionstone
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
a
little
mortary
and
limey
at
present
,
but
we
be
get
on
capitally
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
we
be
get
on
so
fast
,
at
one
time
,
that
we
rather
overdo
it
,
and
build
a
street
of
shop
,
the
business
of
which
may
be
expect
to
arrive
in
about
ten
year
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
sensibly
lay
out
in
general
;
and
with
a
little
care
and
pain
(
by
no
mean
want
,
so
far
)
,
shall
become
a
very
pretty
place
.
 
<EOS>
We
ought
to
be
,
for
our
situation
be
delightful
,
our
air
be
delicious
,
and
our
breezy
hill
and
down
,
carpet
with
wild
thyme
,
and
decorate
with
million
of
wild
flower
,
be
,
on
the
faith
of
a
pedestrian
,
perfect
.
 
<EOS>
in
New
Pavilionstone
we
be
a
little
too
much
addict
to
small
window
with
more
brick
in
them
than
glass
,
and
we
be
not
over
-
fanciful
in
the
way
of
decorative
architecture
,
and
we
get
unexpected
sea
-
view
through
crack
in
the
street
door
;
on
the
whole
,
however
,
we
be
very
snug
and
comfortable
,
and
well
accommodate
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
Home
Secretary
(
if
there
be
such
an
officer
)
can
not
too
soon
shut
up
the
burial
-
ground
of
the
old
parish
church
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
the

of

Pavilionstone

get
no

of
it
,
if
it
be
too
long

I

five
wonderment
from

<EOS>
I
have
wonder
ever
since
,
whether
the
beast
ever
do
get
used
to
those
small
place
of
confinement
;
whether
the
monkey
have
that
very
horrible
flavour
in
their
free
state
;
whether
wild
animal
have
a
natural
ear
for
time
and
tune
,
and
therefore
every
four
-
footed
creature
begin
to
howl
in
despair
when
the
band
begin
to
play
;
what
the
giraffe
do
with
his
neck
when
his
cart
be
shut
up
;
and
,
whether
the
elephant
feel
ashamed
of
himself
when
he
be
bring
out
of
his
den
to
stand
on
his
head
in
the
presence
of
the
whole
Collection

<EOS>
We
be
a
tidal
harbour
at
Pavilionstone
,
as
indeed
I
have
imply
already
in
my
mention
of
tidal
train
.
 
<EOS>
at
low
water
,
we
be
a
heap
of
mud
,
with
an
empty
channel
in
it
where
a
couple
of
man
in
big
boot
always
shovel
and
scoop
:
with
what
exact
object
,
I
be
unable
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
time
,
all
the
strand
fishing
-
boat
turn
over
on
their
side
,
as
if
they
be
dead
marine
monster
;
the
collier
and
other
ship
stick
disconsolate
in
the
mud
;
the
steamer
look
as
if
their
white
chimney
would
never
smoke
more
,
and
their
red
paddle
never
turn
again
;
the
green
sea
-
slime
and
weed
upon
the
rough
stone
at
the
entrance
,
seem
record
of
obsolete
high
tide
never
more
to
flow
;
the
flagstaff
-
halyard
droop
;
the
very
little
wooden
lighthouse
shrink
in
the
idle
glare
of
the
sun
.
 
<EOS>
and
here
I
may
observe
of
the
very
little
wooden
lighthouse
,
that
when
it
be
light
at
night
,
---
red
and
green
,
---
it
look
so
like
a
medical
man
's

that
several

at
various

find
,
on
occasion
of
premature
domestic
anxiety
,
go
round

round
it
,
try
to
find
the
Nightbell
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
the
moment
the
tide
begin
to
make
,
the
Pavilionstone
Harbour
begin
to
revive
.
 
<EOS>
It
feel
the
breeze
of
the
rise
water
before
the
water
come
,
and
begin
to
flutter
and
stir
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
little
shallow
wave
creep
in
,
barely
overlap
one
another
,
the
vane
at
the
masthead
wake
,
and
become
agitated
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
tide
rise
,
the
fishing

boat
get
into
good
spirit
and
dance
,
the
flagstaff
hoist
a
bright
red
flag
,
the

smoke
,
crane
creak
,
horse

carriage
<EOS>
dangle

<EOS>
now

the

up
buoyantly

<EOS>
now
,
the
cart
that
have
come
down
for
coal
,
load
away
as
hard
as
they
can
load

<EOS>
now
,
the
steamer
smoke
immensely
,
and
occasionally
blow
at
the
paddle
-
box
like
a
vaporous
whale
-
greatly
disturbing
nervous
lounger
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
both
the
tide
and
the
breeze
have
rise

and
you
be

<EOS>
now

the

top

<EOS>
now
,
the
bell

and
the
locomotive
hiss
and
shriek
,
and
the
train
come
glide
in

and
the
two
hundred

eighty

seven
come
scuffle
out
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
there
be
not
only
a
tide
of
water
,
but
a
tide
of
people
,
and
a
tide
of
luggage
---
all
tumble
and
flow
and
bounce
about
together
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
after
infinite
bustle
,
the
steamer
steam
out
,
and
we
(
on
the
Pier

be
all
delighted
when
she
roll

roll
her

out

the

eager

and
this

<EOS>
out
of
the
season
 
<EOS>
It
fall
to
my
lot
,
this
last
bleak
Spring
,
to
find
myself
in
a
watering
-
place
out
of
the
Season
.
 
<EOS>
a
vicious
north
-
east
squall
blow
me
into
it
from
foreign
part
,
and
I
tarry
in
it
alone
for
three
day
,
resolve
to
be
exceedingly
busy
.
   
<EOS>
on
the
first
day
,
I
begin
business
by
look
for
two
hour
at
the
sea
,
and
stare
the
Foreign
Militia
out
of
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
have
dispose
of
these
important
engagement
,
I
sit
down
at
one
of
the
two
window
of
my
room
,
intent
on
do
something
desperate
in
the
way
of
literary
composition
,
and
write
a
chapter
of
unheard
-
of
excellence
---
with
which
the
present
essay
have
no
connexion
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
remarkable
quality
in
a
watering
-
place
out
of
the
season
,
that
everything
in
it
,
will
and
must
be
look
at
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
previous
suspicion
of
this
fatal
truth
<EOS>
but
,
the
moment
I
sit
down
to
write
<EOS>
,
I
begin
to
perceive
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
scarcely
fall
into
my
most
promising
attitude
,
and
dip
my
pen
in
the
ink
,
when
I
find
the
clock
upon
the
pier
---
a
red
-
faced
clock
with
a
white
rim
---
importune
me
in
a
highly
vexatious
manner
to
consult
my
watch
,
and
see
how
I
be
off
for
Greenwich
time
.
 
<EOS>
have
no
intention
of
make
a
voyage
or
take
an
observation
,
I
have
not
the
least
need
of
Greenwich
time
,
and
could
have
put
up
with
watering
-
place
time
as
a
sufficiently
accurate
article
.
 
<EOS>
the
pier
-
clock
,
however
,
persist
,
I
feel
it
necessary
to
lay
down
my
pen
,
compare
my
watch
with
him
,
and
fall
into
a
grave
solicitude
about
half
-
second
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
take
up
my
pen
again
,
and
be
about
to
commence
that
valuable
chapter
,
when
a
Custom
-
house
cutter
under
the
window
request
that
I
would
hold
a
naval
review
of
her
,
immediately
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
,
under
the
circumstance
,
for
any
mental
resolution
,
merely
human
,
to
dismiss
the
Custom
-
house
cutter
,
because
the
shadow
of
her
topmast
fall
upon
my
paper
,
and
the
vane
play
on
the
masterly
blank
chapter
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
therefore
under
the
necessity
of
go
to
the
other
window
;
sit
astride
of
the
chair
there
,
like
Napoleon
bivouac
in
the
print
;
and
inspect
the
cutter
as
she
lie
,
all
that
day
,
in
the
way
of
my
chapter
,
o
!
<EOS>
She
be
rig
to
carry
a
quantity
of
canvas
,
but
her
hull
be
so
very
small
that
four
giant

of

in

<EOS>
several

,
when
the

one

swing

in

<EOS>
I
be
now
under
an
obligation
to
consider
that

on

and
to
wonder
where

when

and
why
she
be
go

and
at
what
date
she

who

her

<EOS>
with

I

It

the

the

chapter

for

<EOS>
It
be
blow
stiffly
from
the
east

and
it
rumble
in
the
chimney
and
shake
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
not
much
;
but
,
look
out
into
the
wind
's
grey
eye
for
inspiration
,
I
lay
down
my
pen
again
to
make
the
remark
to
myself
,
how
emphatically
everything
by
the
sea
declare
that
it
have
a
great
concern
in
the
state
of
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
the
tree
blow
all
one
way
;
the
defence
of
the
harbour
rear
highest
and
strong
against
the
raging

;
the
shingle
fling
up
on
the
beach
from
the
same
direction
;
the
number
of
arrow
point
at
the
common
enemy
;
the
sea
tumble
in
and
rush
towards
them
as
if
it
be
inflame
by
the
sight
.
 
<EOS>
this
put
it
in
my
head
that
I
really
ought
to
go
out
and
take
a
walk
in
the
wind
;
so
,
I
give
up
the
magnificent
chapter
for
that
day
,
entirely
persuade
myself
that
I
be
under
a
moral
obligation
to
have
a
blow
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
a
good
one
,
and
that
on

the
very
high

on

where
I
meet
the
stage

coach
with
all

too

and
overtook
a
flock
of

wool
about
their

blow
into
such

they
look
like
fleecy

<EOS>
the

play
upon
the
lighthouse
as

it

the

and
at
interval
long

<EOS>
a

delude

<EOS>
I

right
over

the
cry

distress
from
the

emigrant
ship

"
   
<EOS>
when
I
get
back
to
my
watering
-
place
out
of
the
season
,
and
have
do
my
twenty
mile
in
good
style
,
I
find
that
the
celebrated
Black
Mesmerist
intend
favour
the
public
that
evening
in
the
Hall
of
the
Muses
,
which
he
have
engage
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
good
dinner
,
seat
by
the
fire
in
an
easy
chair
,
I
begin
to
waver
in
a
design
I
have
form
of
wait
on
the
Black
Mesmerist
,
and
to
incline
towards
the
expediency
of
remain
where
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
a
point
of
gallantry
be
involve
in
my
doing
so
,
inasmuch
as
I
have
not
leave
France
alone
,
but
have
come
from
the
prison
of
St
Pelagie
with
my
distinguished
and
unfortunate
friend
Madame
Roland
(
in
two
volume
which
I
buy
for
two
franc
each
,
at
the
book
-
stall
in
the
Place
de
la
Concorde
,
Paris
,
at
the
corner
of
the
Rue
Royale
)
.
<EOS>
decide
to
pass
the
evening
tete
-
a
-
tete
with
Madame
Roland
,
I
derive
,
as
I
always
do
,
great
pleasure
from
that
spiritual
woman
's
society
,
and
the
charm
of
her
brave
soul
and
engage
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
confess
that
if
she
have
only
some
more
fault
,
only
a
few
more
passionate
failing
of
any
kind
,
I
may
love
her
better
;
but
I
be
content
to
believe
that
the
deficiency
be
in
me
,
and
not
in
her
.
 
<EOS>
We
spend
some
sadly
interesting
hour
together
on
this
occasion
,
and
she
tell
me
again
of
her
cruel
discharge
from
the
Abbaye
,
and
of
her
be
re
-
arrest
before
her
free
foot
have
spring
lightly
up
half
-
a
-
dozen
step
of
her
own
staircase
,
and
carry
off
to
the
prison
which
she
only
leave
for
the
guillotine
.
   
<EOS>
Madame
Roland
<EOS>
and
I
take
leave
of
one
another
before
mid
-
night
,
and
I
go
to
bed
full
of
vast
intention
for
next
day
,
in
connexion
with
the
unparalleled
chapter
.
 
<EOS>
to
hear
the
foreign
mail
-
steamer
come
in
at
dawn
of
day
,
and
to
know
that
I
be
not
aboard
or
oblige
to
get
up
,
be
very
comfortable
;
so
,
I
rise
for
the
chapter
in
great
force
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
advance
so
far
as
to
sit
down
at
my
window
again
on
my
second
morning
,
and
to
write
the
first
half
-
line
of
the
chapter
and
strike
it
out
,
not
like
it
,
when
my
conscience
reproach
me
with
not
have
survey
the
watering
-
place
out
of
the
season
,
after
all
,
yesterday
,
but
with
have
go
straight
out
of
it
at
the
rate
of
four
mile
and
a
half
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
obviously
the
good
amend
that
I
could
make
for
this
remissness
be
to
go
and
look
at
it
without
another
moment
's
delay
.
 
<EOS>
so
---
altogether
as
a
matter
of
duty
---
I
give
up
the
magnificent
chapter
for
another
day
,
and
saunter
out
with
my
hand
in
my
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
all
the
house
and
lodging
ever
let
to
visitor
,
be
to
let
that
morning
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
have
snow
bill
with
to
let
upon
them
.
<EOS>
this
put
me
upon
think
what
the
owner
of
all
those
apartment
do
,
out
of
the
season
;
how
they
employ
their
time
,
and
occupy
their
mind
.
 
<EOS>
They
could
not
be
always
go
to
the
Methodist
chapel
,
of
which
I
pass
one
every
other
minute
.
 
<EOS>
They
must
have
some
other
recreation
.
 
<EOS>
whether
they
pretend
to
take
one
another
's
lodging
,
and
open
one
another
's
tea
-
caddie
in
fun
?
<EOS>
whether
they
cut
slice
off
their
own
beef
and
mutton
,
and
make
believe
that
it
belong
to
somebody
else
?
 
<EOS>
whether
they
play
little
drama
of
life
,
as
child
do
,
and
say
,
"
I
ought
to
come
and
look
at
your
apartment
,
and
you
ought
to
ask
two
guinea
a
-
week
too
much
,
and
then
I
ought
to
say
I
must
have
the
rest
of
the
day
to
think
of
it
,
and
then
you
ought
to
say
that
another
lady
and
gentleman
with
no
child
in
family
have
make
an
offer
very
close
to
your
own
term
,
and
you
have
pass
your
word
to
give
them
a
positive
answer
in
half
an
hour
,
and
indeed
be
just
go
to
take
the
bill
down
when
you
hear
the
knock
,
and
then
I
ought
to
take
them
,
you
know
?
"
 
<EOS>
twenty
such
speculation
engage
my
thought
.
<EOS>
then
,
after
pass
,
still
cling
to
the
wall
,
defaced
rag
of
the
bill
of
last
year
's
Circus
,
I
come
to
a
back
field
near
a
timber
-
yard
where
the
Circus
itself
have
be
,
and
where
there
be
yet
a
sort
of
monkish
tonsure
on
the
grass
,
indicate
the
spot
where
the
young
lady
have
go
round
upon
her
pet
steed
Firefly
in
her
dare
flight
.
 
<EOS>
turn
into
the
town
again
,
I
come
among
the
shop
,
and
they
be
emphatically
out
of
the
season
.
 
<EOS>
the
chemist
have
no
box
of
ginger
-
beer
powder
,
no
beautify
sea

side

<EOS>
It
have
fall
calm
,
however
,
in

night
,
and
as
I
sit
at
breakfast
I
blush
to
remember
that
I
have
not

be
on

<EOS>
I
a
walker
,

not
yet

<EOS>
really
,
on
so
quiet

bright
a
morning
this
must
be
set
right
.
 
<EOS>
as
an
essential
part
of
the
Whole
Duty
of
Man
,
therefore
,
I
leave
the
chapter
to
itself
---
for
the
present
---
and
go
on
the
Downs
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
wonderfully
green
and
beautiful
,
and
give
me
a
good
deal
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
do
with
the
free
air
and
the
view
,
I
have
to
go
down
into
the
valley
and
look
after
the
hop
(
which
I
know
nothing
about
)
,
and
to
be
equally
solicitous
as
to
the
cherry
orchard
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
take
it
on
myself
to
cross
-
examine
a
tramp
family

mother
allege
,
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
by
herself
in
person

to
have
die

to
accompany
eighteenpence
which
produce
a
great
effect
,
with
moral
admonition
which
produce
none
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
finally
,
it
be
late
in
the
afternoon
before
I
get
back
to
the
unprecedented
chapter
,
and
then
I
determine
that
it
be
out
of
the
season
,
as
the
place
be

and
put
it
away
.
   
<EOS>

<EOS>
I
make

accord
to
my
calculation
,
four

ninepence
to
begin
with
,
and
it
may
have
warm
up
,
in
the
course
of
the
evening

Mr

do
the

also
take
off

tuck
up

I
put

an
ingenious
improvement
mean
to
do

he
have
do
something
wrong

how
else
can
a

turn
?
 
<EOS>
all
inventor
take
out
a
Patent
MUST
feel
so
.
 
<EOS>
and
look
at
the
expense
.
 
<EOS>
how
hard
on
me

hard
on

any
merit
in

<EOS>
(
and
my

take
up
now

I

the
addition
yourself

it

come

<EOS>
no

about

"

if

a

therein

thereby
have

"
   
<EOS>
My
opinion
be
the
same
as
Thomas
Joy
.
 
<EOS>
further
.
 
<EOS>
in
William
Butcher
's
delivering
"
that
the

Chaff

wax
must
be
do
away
with

and
that
England
have
be
chaff
and
wax
sufficient
,
"
I
agree
.
    
<EOS>
the
Noble
Savage
 
<EOS>
to
come
to
the
point
at
once
,
I
beg
to
say
that
I
have
not
the
least
belief
in
the
Noble
Savage
.
 
<EOS>
I
consider
him
a
prodigious
nuisance
,
and
an
enormous
superstition
.
 
<EOS>
His
call
rum
fire
-
water
,
and
me
a
pale
face
,
wholly
fail
to
reconcile
me
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
what
he
call
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
call
him
a
savage
,
and
I
call
a
savage
a
something
highly
desirable
to
be
civilise
off
the
face
of
the
earth
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
a
mere
gent
(
which
I
take
to
be
the
low
form
of
civilisation
)
well
than
a
howling
,
whistle
,
cluck
,
stamp
,
jump
,
tear
savage
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
all
one
to
me
,
whether
he
stick
a
fish
-
bone
through
his
visage
,
or
bit
of
tree
through
the
lobe
of
his
ear
,
or
bird
's
feather
in
his
head
;
whether
he
flatten
his
hair
between
two
board
,
or
spread
his
nose
over
the
breadth
of
his
face
,
or
drag
his
low
lip
down
by
great
weight
,
or
blacken
his
tooth
,
or
knock
them
out
,
or
paint
one
cheek
red
and
the
other
blue
,
or
tattoos
himself
,
or
oil
himself
,
or
rub
his
body
with
fat
,
or
crimp
it
with
knife
.
 
<EOS>
yield
to
whichsoever
of
these
agreeable
eccentricity
,
he
be
a
savage
---
cruel
,
false
,
thievish
,
murderous
;
addict
more
or
less
to
grease
,
entrail
,
and
beastly
custom
;
a
wild
animal
with
the
questionable
gift
of
boasting
;
a
conceited
,
tiresome
,
bloodthirsty
,
monotonous
humbug
.
   
<EOS>
yet
it
be
extraordinary
to
observe
how
some
people
will
talk
about
him
,
as
they
talk
about
the
good
old
time
;
how
they
will
regret
his
disappearance
,
in
the
course
of
this
world
's
development
,
from
such
and
such
land
where
his
absence
be
a
blessed
relief
and
an
indispensable
preparation
for
the
sowing
of
the
very
first
seed
of
any
influence
that
can
exalt
humanity
;
how
,
even
with
the
evidence
of
himself
before
them
,
they
will
either
be
determine
to
believe
,
or
will
suffer
themselves
to
be
persuade
into
believing
,
that
he
be
something
which
their
five
sense
tell
them
he
be
not
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
Mr
Catlin
,
some
few
year
ago
,
with
his
Ojibbeway
Indians
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Catlin
be
an
energetic
,
earnest
man
,
who
have
live
among
more
tribe
of
Indians
than
I
need
reckon
up
here
,
and
who
have
write
a
picturesque
and
glowing
book
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
with
his
party
of
Indians
squat
and
spit
on
the
table
before
him
,
or
dance
their
miserable
jig
after
their
own
dreary
manner
,
he
call
,
in
all
good
faith
,
upon
his
civilised
audience
to
take
notice
of
their
symmetry
and
grace
,
their
perfect
limb

the
exquisite
expression
of
their
pantomime

mere
animal
,
they
be
wretched
creature
,
very
low
in
the
scale
and
very
poorly
form
;
and
as
man
and
woman
possess
any
power
of
truthful
dramatic
expression
by
mean
of
action
,
they
be
no
well
than
the
chorus
at
an
italian
Opera
in
England
---
and
would
have
be
bad
if
such
a
thing
be
possible
.
   
<EOS>
Mine
be
no
new
view
of
the
noble
savage
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
writer
on
natural
history
find
him
out
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
BUFFON
know
what
he
be
,
and
show
why
he
be
the
sulky
tyrant
that
he
be
to
his
woman
,
and
how
it
happen
(
Heaven
be
praise
!
)
<EOS>
that
his
race
be
spare
in
number
.
 
<EOS>
for
evidence
of
the
quality
of
his
moral
nature
,
pass
himself
for
a
moment
and
refer
to
his
"
faithful
dog
.
"
 
<EOS>
have
he
ever
improve
a
dog
,
or
attach
a
dog
,
since
his
nobility
first
run
wild
in
wood
,
and
be
bring
down
(
at
a
very
long
shot
)
by
POPE
?
<EOS>
or
do
the
animal
that
be
the
friend
of
man
,
always
degenerate
in
his
low
society
?
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
miserable
nature
of
the
noble
savage
that
be
the
new
thing
;
it
be
the
whimpering
over
him
with
maudlin
admiration
,
and
the
affect
to
regret
him
,
and
the
drawing
of
any
comparison
of
advantage
between
the
blemish
of
civilisation
and
the
tenor
of
his
swinish
life
.
 
<EOS>
there
may
have
be
a
change
now
and
then
in
those
disease
absurdity
,
but
there
be
none
in
him
.
   
<EOS>
think
of
the
Bushmen
.
 
<EOS>
think
of
the
two
man
and
the
two
woman
who
have
be
exhibit
about
England
for
some
year
.
 
<EOS>
be
the
majority
of
person
---
who
remember
the
horrid
little
leader
of
that
party
in
his
fester
bundle
of
hide
,
with
his
filth
and
his
antipathy
to
water
,
and
his
straddle
leg
,
and
his
odious
eye
shade
by
his
brutal
hand
,
and
his
cry
of
"
Qu
-
u
-
u
-
u
-
aaa
!
"
<EOS>
(
bosjesman
for
something
desperately
insult
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
)
---
<EOS>
conscious
of
an
affectionate
yearning
towards
that
noble
savage
,
or
be
it
idiosyncratic
in
me
to
abhor
,
detest
,
abominate
,
and
abjure
him
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
reserve
on
this
subject
,
and
will
frankly
state
that
,
set
aside
that
stage
of
the
entertainment
when
he
counterfeit
the
death
of
some
creature
he
have
shoot
,
by
lay
his
head
on
his
hand
and
shake
his
left
leg
---
at
which
time
I
think
it
would
have
be
justifiable
homicide
to
slay
him
<EOS>
---
I
have
never
see
that
group
sleeping
,
smoking
,
and
expectorate
round
their
brazier
,
but
I
have
sincerely
desire
that
something
may
happen
to
the
charcoal
smouldering
therein
,
which
would
cause
the
immediate
suffocation
of
the
whole
of
the
noble
stranger
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
at
present
a
party
of
Zulu
Kaffirs
exhibit
at
the
St
George
's
Gallery
,
Hyde
Park
Corner
,
London
.
 
<EOS>
these
noble
savage
be
represent
in
a
most
agreeable
manner
;
they
be
see
in
an
elegant
theatre
,
fit
with
appropriate
scenery
of
great
beauty
,
and
they
be
describe
in
a
very
sensible
and
unpretending
lecture
,
deliver
with
a
modesty
which
be
quite
a
pattern
to
all
similar
exponent
.
 
<EOS>
though
extremely
ugly
,
they
be
much
better
shape
than
such
of
their
predecessor
as
I
have
refer
to
;
and
they
be
rather
picturesque
to
the
eye
,
though
far
from
odoriferous
to
the
nose
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
visitor
leave
to
his
own
interpreting
and
imagining
may
suppose
these
nobleman
to
be
about
,
when
they
give
vent
to
that
pantomimic
expression
which
be
quite
settle
to
be
the
natural
gift
of
the
noble
savage
,
I
can
not
possibly
conceive
;
for
it
be
so
much
too
luminous
for
my
personal
civilisation
that
it
convey
no
idea
to
my
mind
beyond
a
general
stamping
,
ramp
,
and
raving
,
remarkable
(
as
everything
in
savage
life
be
)
for
its
dire
uniformity
.
 
<EOS>
but
let
us
---
with
the
interpreter
's
assistance
,
of
which
I
for
one
stand
so
much
in
need
<EOS>
---
see
what
the
noble
savage
do
in
Zulu
Kaffirland
.
   
<EOS>
the
noble
savage
set
a
king
to
reign
over
him
,
to
whom
he
submit
his
life
and
limb
without
a
murmur
or
question
,
and
whose
whole
life
be
pass
chin
deep
in
a
lake
of
blood
;
but
who
,
after
kill
incessantly
,
be
in
his
turn
kill
by
his
relation
and
friend
,
the
moment
a
grey
hair
appear
on
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
noble
savage
's
war
with
his
fellow
-
savage
<EOS>
(
and
he
take
no
pleasure
in
anything
else
)
be
war
of
extermination
---
which
be
the
good
thing
I
know
of
him
,
and
the
most
comfortable
to
my
mind
when
I
look
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
moral
feeling
of
any
kind
,
sort
,
or
description
;
and
his
"
mission
"
may
be
sum
up
as
simply
diabolical
.
   
<EOS>
the
ceremony
with
which
he
faintly
diversify
his
life
be
,
of
course
,
of
a
kindre
nature
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
want
a
wife
he
appear
before
the
kennel
of
the
gentleman
whom
he
have
select
for
his
father
-
in
-
law
,
attend
by
a
party
of
male
friend
of
a
very
strong
flavour
,
who
screech
and
whistle
and
stamp
an
offer
of
so
many
cow
for
the
young
lady
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
the
choose
father
-
in

law
---
also
support
by
a
high
-
flavour
party
of
male
friend
---
screech
,
whistles
,
and
yell
(
be
seat
on
the
ground
,
he
can
not
stamp
)
that
there
never
be
such
a
daughter
in
the
market
as
his
daughter
,
and
that
he
must
have
six
more
cow
.
 
<EOS>
the
son
-
in
-
law
and
his
select
circle
of
backer
screech
,
whistle
,
stamp
,
and
yell
in
reply
,
that
they
will
give
three
more
cow
.
 
<EOS>
the
father
-
in
-
law
(
an
old
deluder
,
overpay
at
the
beginning
)
accept
four
,
and
rise
to
bind
the
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
party
,
the
young
lady
include
,
then
fall
into
epileptic
convulsion
,
and
screech
,
whistle
,
stamp
,
and
yell
together
---
and
nobody
take
any
notice
of
the
young
lady
(
whose
charm
be
not
to
be
think
of
without
a
shudder
)
---
the
noble
savage
be
consider
married
,
and
his
friend
make
demoniacal
leap
at
him
by
way
of
congratulation
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
noble
savage
find
himself
a
little
unwell
,
and
mention
the
circumstance
to
his
friend
,
it
be
immediately
perceive
that
he
be
under
the
influence
of
witchcraft
.
 
<EOS>
a
learned
personage
,
call
an
Imyanger
or
Witch
doctor
,
be
immediately
send
for
to
Nooker
the
Umtargartie
,
or
smell
out
the
witch
.
 
<EOS>
the
male
inhabitant
of
the
kraal
be
seat
on
the
ground
,
the
learned
doctor
,
get
up
like
a
grizzly
bear
,
appear
,
and
administer
a
dance
of
a
most
terrific
nature
,
during
the
exhibition
of
which
remedy
<EOS>
he
incessantly
gnash
his
tooth
,
and
howl
:
---
<EOS>
"
I
be
the

Umtargartie

Yow

I
perceive
here
a
genuine
and
real
Umtargartie

Hoosh
Hoosh

<EOS>
in
whose
blood
I

the

Imyanger

o
yow

"
 
<EOS>
all
this
time
the
learn
physician
be
look
out
among
the
attentive
face
for
some
unfortunate
man
who
owe
him
a
cow
,
or
who
have
give
him
any
small
offence

or
against
whom
,
without
offence
,
he
have
conceive
a
spite

<EOS>
Him
he
never
fail
to
Nooker
as
the
Umtargartie
,
and
he
be
instantly
kill
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
absence
of
such
an
individual
,
the
usual
practice
be
to
Nooker
the
quiet
and
most
gentlemanly
person
in
company
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
nookering
be
invariably
follow
on
the
spot
by
the
butchering
.
   
<EOS>
some
of
the
noble
savage
in
whom
Mr
Catlin
be
so
strongly
interested
,
and
the
diminution
of
whose
number
,
by
rum
and
smallpox
,
greatly
affect
him
,
have
a
custom
not
unlike
this
,
though
much
more
appalling
and
disgusting
in
its
odious
detail
.
   
<EOS>
the
woman
be
at
work
in
the
field
,
hoe
the
indian
corn
,
and
the
noble
savage
be
asleep
in
the
shade
,
the
chief
have
sometimes
the
condescension
to
come
forth
,
and
lighten
the
labour
by
look
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
on
these
occasion
,
he
seat
himself
in
his
own
savage
chair
,
and
be
attend
by
his
shield
-
bearer
:
who
hold
over
his
head
a
shield
of
cowhide
---
in
shape
like
an
immense
mussel
shell
---
fearfully
and
wonderfully
,
after
the
manner
of
a
theatrical
supernumerary
.
 
<EOS>
but
lest
the
great
man
should
forget
his
greatness
in
the
contemplation
of
the
humble
work
of
agriculture
<EOS>
,
there
suddenly
rush
in
a
poet
,
retain
for
the
purpose
,
call
a
Praiser
.
 
<EOS>
this
literary
gentleman
wear
a
leopard
's
head
over
his
own
,
and
a
dress
of
tiger

tail
;
he
have
the
appearance
of
have
come
express
on
his
hind
leg
from
the
Zoological
Gardens
;
and
he
incontinently
strike
up
the
chief
's
praise
,
plunge
and
tear
all
the
while

<EOS>
there
be
a
frantic
wickedness
in
this
brute
's
manner
of
worry
the
air

gnash
out
,
"
o
what

delightful
chief
he
be

o

delicious
quantity
of
blood
he
shed
!

o
how
majestically
he
lap
it
up

o
how
charmingly
cruel

row

how
fond
I
be

"
which
may
tempt
the
Society
of
Friends
to
charge
at
a
hand
-
gallop
into
the
Swartz
-
Kop
location
and
exterminate
the
whole
kraal
.
   
<EOS>
when
war
be
afoot
among
the
noble
savage
---
which
be
always
---
the
chief
hold
a
council
to
ascertain
whether
it
be
the
opinion
of
his
brother
and
friend
in
general
that
the
enemy
shall
be
exterminate
.
 
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
,
after
the
performance
of
an
Umsebeuza
,
or
war
song
,
---
which
be
exactly
like
all
the
other
song
,
---
the
chief
make
a
speech
to
his
brother
and
friend
,
arrange
in
single
file
.
 
<EOS>
no
particular
order
be
observe
during
the
delivery
of
this
address
,
but
every
gentleman
who
find
himself
excited
by
the
subject
,
instead
of
cry
"
Hear
,
hear
!
"
<EOS>
as
be
the
custom
with
us
,
dart
from
the
rank
and
trample
out
the
life
,
or
crush
the
skull
,
or
mash
the
face
,
or
scoop
out
the
eye
,
or
break
the
limb
,
or
perform
a
whirlwind
of
atrocity
on
the
body
,
of
an
imaginary
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
several
gentleman
become
thus
excited
at
once
,
and
pound
away
without
the
least
regard
to
the
orator
,
that
illustrious
person
be
rather
in
the
position
of
an
orator
in
an
irish
House
of
Commons
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
several
of
these
scene
of
savage
life
bear
a
strong
generic
resemblance
to
an
irish
election
,
and
I
think
would
be
extremely
well
receive
and
understand
at
Cork
.
   
<EOS>
in
all
these
ceremony
the
noble
savage
hold
forth
to
the
utmost
possible
extent
about
himself
;
from
which
(
to
turn
him
to
some
civilised
account
)
we
may
learn
,
I
think
,
that
as
egotism
be
one
of
the
most
offensive
and
contemptible
littleness
a
civilised
man
can
exhibit
,
so
it
be
really
incompatible
with
the
interchange
of
idea
;
inasmuch
as
if
we
all
talk
about
ourselves
<EOS>
we
should
soon
have
no
listener
,
and
must
be
all
yell
and
screech
at
once
on
our
own
separate
account
:
make
society
hideous
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
my
opinion
that
if
we
retain
in
us
anything
of
the
noble
savage
,
we
could
not
get
rid
of
it
too
soon
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
fact
be
clearly
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
upon
the
wife
and
dowry
question
,
substitute
coin
for
cow
,
we
have
assuredly
nothing
of
the
Zulu
Kaffir
leave
.
 
<EOS>
the
endurance
of
despotism
be
one
great
distinguishing
mark
of
a
savage
always
.
 
<EOS>
the
improve
world
have
quite
get
the
well
of
that
too
.
<EOS>
in
like
manner
,
Paris
be
a
civilised
city
,
and
the
Theatre
Francais
a
highly
civilised
theatre
;
and
we
shall
never
hear
,
and
never
have
hear
in
these
later
day
(
of
course
)
of
the
Praiser
THERE
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
civilised
poet
have
well
work
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
Nookering
Umtargarties
,
there
be
no
pretended
Umtargarties
in
Europe
,
and
no
european
power
to
Nooker
them
;
that
would
be
mere
spydom
,
subordination
,
small
malice
,
superstition
,
and
false
pretence
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
to
private
Umtargarties
,
be
we
not
in
the
year
eighteen
hundred
and
fifty
-
three
,
with
spirit
rap
at
our
door
?
   
<EOS>
to
conclude
as
I
begin
.
 
<EOS>
My
position
be
,
that
if
we
have
anything
to
learn
from
the
Noble
Savage
,
it
be
what
to
avoid
.
 
<EOS>
His
virtue
be
a
fable
;
his
happiness
be
a
delusion
;
his
nobility
,
nonsense
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
no
great
justification
for
be
cruel
to
the
miserable
object
,
than
for
be
cruel
to
a
WILLIAM
SHAKESPEARE
or
an
ISAAC
NEWTON
;
but
he
pass
away
before
an
immeasurably
well
and
high
power
than
ever
run
wild
in
any
earthly
wood
,
and
the
world
will
be
all
the
well
when
his
place
know
him
no
more
.

<EOS>
Straw
,
a
little
wiry
sergeant
of
meek
demeanour
and
strong
sense
,
would
knock
at
a
door
and
ask
a
series
of
question
in
any
mild
character
you
choose
to
prescribe
to
him
,
from
a
charity
-
boy
upwards
,
and
seem
as
innocent
as
an
infant
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
,
one
and
all
,
respectable
-
look
man
;
of
perfectly
good
deportment
and
unusual
intelligence
;
with
nothing
lounge
or
slinking
in
their
manner
;
with
an
air
of
keen
observation
and
quick
perception
when
address
;
and
generally
present
in
their
face
,
trace
more
or
less
marked
of
habitually
lead
life
of
strong
mental
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
all
good
eye
;
and
they
all
can
,
and
they
all
do
,
look
full
at
whomsoever
<EOS>
they
speak
to
.
   
<EOS>
We
light
the
cigar
,
and
hand
round
the
glass
(
which
be
very
temperately
use
indeed
)
,
and
the
conversation
begin
by
a
modest
amateur
reference
on
the
editorial
part
to
the
swell
mob
.
<EOS>
Inspector
Wield
immediately
remove
his
cigar
from
his
lip
,
wave
his
right
hand
,
and
say
,
"
<EOS>
regard
the
swell
mob
,
sir
,
I
can
not
do
well
than
call
upon
Sergeant
Witchem
.
 
<EOS>
because
the
reason
why
?
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
Sergeant
Witchem
be
better
acquaint
with
the
swell
mob
than
any
officer
in
London
.
"
   
<EOS>
Our
heart
leap
up
when
we
beheld
this
rainbow
in
the
sky
,
we
turn
to
Sergeant
Witchem
,
who
very
concisely
,
and
in
well
-
choose
language
,
go
into
the
subject
forthwith
.
 
<EOS>
meantime
,
the
whole
of
his
brother
officer
be
closely
interested
in
attend
to
what
he
say
,
and
observe
its
effect
.
 
<EOS>
presently
they
begin
to
strike
in
,
one
or
two
together
,
when
an
opportunity
offer
,
and
the
conversation
become
general
.
 
<EOS>
but
these
brother
officer
only
come
in
to
the
assistance
of
each
other
---
not
to
the
contradiction
---
and
a
more
amicable
brotherhood
there
could
not
be
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
swell
mob
,
we
diverge
to
the
kindred
topic
of
cracksman
,
fence
,
public
-
house
dancer
,
area
-
sneak
,
design
young
people
who
go
out
"
gonophing
,
"
and
other
"
school
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
observable
throughout
these
revelation
,
that
Inspector
Stalker
,
the
Scotchman
,
be
always
exact
and
statistical
,
and
that
when
any
question
of
figure
arise
,
everybody
as
by
one
consent
pause
,
and
look
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
have
exhaust
the
various
school
of
art
---
during
which
discussion
the
whole
body
have
remain
profoundly
attentive
,
except
when
some
unusual
noise
at
the
Theatre
over
the
way
have
induce
some
gentleman
to
glance
inquiringly
towards
the
window
in
that
direction
,
behind
his
next
neighbour
's
back
---
we
burrow
for
information
on
such
point
as
the
following
.
 
<EOS>
whether
there
really
be
any
highway
robbery
in
London
,
or
whether
some
circumstance
not
convenient
to
be
mention
by
the
aggrieved
party
,
usually
precede
the
robbery
complain
of
,
under
that
head
,
which
quite
change
their
character
?
 
<EOS>
certainly
the
latter
,
almost
always
.
<EOS>
whether
in
the
case
of
robbery
in
house
,
where
servant
be
necessarily
expose
to
doubt
,
innocence
under
suspicion
ever
become
so
like
guilt
in
appearance
,
that
a
good
officer
nee
be
cautious
<EOS>
how
he
judge
it
?
 
<EOS>
undoubtedly
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
be
so
common
or
deceptive
as
such
appearance
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
whether
in
a
place
of
public
amusement
,
a
thief
know
an
officer
,
and
an
officer
know
a
thief
---
suppose
them
,
beforehand
,
stranger
to
each
other
---
because
each
recognise
in
the
other
,
under
all
disguise
,
an
inattention
to
what
be
go
on
,
and
a
purpose
that
be
not
the
purpose
of
be
entertain
?
 
<EOS>
yes
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
way
exactly
.
<EOS>
whether
it
be
reasonable
or
ridiculous
to
trust
to
the
allege
experience
of
thief
as
narrate
by
themselves
,
in
prison
,
or
penitentiary
,
or
anywhere
?
 
<EOS>
in
general
,
nothing
more
absurd
.
<EOS>
lie
be
their
habit
and
their
trade
;
and
they
would
rather
lie
---
even
if
they
have
not
an
interest
in
it
,
and
do
not
want
to
make
themselves
agreeable
---
than
tell
the
truth
.
   
<EOS>
from
these
topic
,
we
glide
into
a
review
of
the
most
celebrated
and
horrible
of
the
great
crime
that
have
be
commit
within
the
last
fifteen
or
twenty
year
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
engage
in
the
discovery
of
almost
all
of
them
,
and
in
the
pursuit
or
apprehension
of
the
murderer
,
be
here
,
down
to
the
very
last
instance
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
our
guest
give
chase
to
and
board
the
emigrant
ship
,
in
which
the
murderess
last
hang
in
London
be
suppose
to
have
embark
.
 
<EOS>
We
learn
from
him
that
his
errand
be
not
announce
to
the
passenger
,
who
may
have
no
idea
of
it
to
this
hour
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
go
below
,
with
the
captain
,
lamp
in
hand
<EOS>
---
it
be
dark
,
and
the
whole
steerage
abed
and
sea
-
sick
---
and
engage
the
Mrs
Manning
who
be
on
board
,
in
a
conversation
about
her
luggage
,
until
she
be
,
with
no
small
pain
,
induce
to
raise
her
head
,
and
turn
her
face
towards
the
light
.
 
<EOS>
satisfied
that
she
be
not
the
object
of
his
search
,
he
quietly
re
-
embark
in
the
Government
steamer
along
-
side
,
and
steam
home
again
with
the
intelligence
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
have
exhaust
these
subject
,
too
,
which
occupy
a
considerable
time
in
the
discussion
,
two
or
three
leave
their
chair
,
whisper
Sergeant
Witchem
,
and
resume
their
seat
.
 
<EOS>
Sergeant
Witchem
,
lean
forward
a
little
,
and
place
a
hand
on
each
of
his
leg
<EOS>
,
then
modestly
speak
as
follow
:
   
<EOS>
"
My
brother
-
officer
wish
me
to
relate
a
little
account
of
my
take
tally
-
ho
Thompson

<EOS>
a
man
ought
not
to
tell
what
he
have
do
himself
;
but
still
,
as
nobody
be
with
me
,
and
,
consequently
,
as
nobody
but
myself
can
tell
it
,
I
will
do
it
in
the
good
way
I
can
,
if
it
should
meet
your
approval

"
   
<EOS>
We
assure
Sergeant
Witchem
that
he
will
oblige
us
very
much
,
and
we
all
compose
ourselves
to
listen
with
great
interest
and
attention
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tally

say
Sergeant

after
merely

.
<EOS>
I
have
to
look
after
Thompson
,
and
I
apply
myself
,
of
course
,
in
the
first
instance
,
to
discover
where
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
Thompson
's
wife
live
,
along
with
a
little
daughter
,
at
Chelsea
.
 
<EOS>
know
that
Thompson
be
somewhere
in
the
country
,
I
watch
the
house
---
especially
at
post
-
time
in
the
morning
---
think
Thompson
be
pretty
likely
to
write
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
sure
enough
,
one
morning
the
postman
come
up
,
and
deliver
a
letter
at
Mrs
Thompson
's
door
.
<EOS>
little
girl
open
the
door
,
and
take
it
in
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
not
always
sure
of
postman
,
though
the
people
at
the
post
-
office
be
always
very
obliging
.
 
<EOS>
a
postman
may
help
us
,
or
he
may
not
,
---
just
as
it
happen
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
go
across
the
road
,
and
I
say
to
the
postman
,
after
he
have
leave
the
letter
,
"
good
morning
!
<EOS>
how
be
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
be
you
!
"
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
just
deliver
a
letter
for
Mrs
Thompson
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
happen
to
remark
what
the
post
-
mark
be
,
perhaps
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
come
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
will
be
plain
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
in
a
small
way
of
business
,
and
I
have
give
Thompson
credit
,
and
I
can
not
afford
to
lose
what
he
owe
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
he
be
get
money
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
he
be
in
the
country
,
and
if
you
could
tell
me
what
the
post
-
mark
be
,
I
should
be
very
much
oblige
to
you
,
and
you
would
do
a
service
to
a
tradesman
in
a
small
way
of
business
that
can
not
afford
a
loss
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
do
assure
you
that
I
do
not
observe
what
the
post
-
mark
be
;
all
I
know
be
,
that
there
be
money
in
the
letter
---
I
should
say
a
sovereign
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
enough
for
me
,
because
of
course
I
know
that
Thompson
have
send
his
wife
money
,
it
be
probable
<EOS>
she
would
write
to
Thompson
,
by
return
of
post
,
to
acknowledge
the
receipt
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
say
"
Thankee
"
to
the
postman
,
and
I
keep
on
the
watch
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
I
see
the
little
girl
come
out
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
I
follow
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
go
into
a
stationer
's
shop
,
and
I
need
not
say
to
you
that
I
look
in
at
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
She
buy
some
writing
-
paper
and
envelope
,
and
a
pen
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
to
myself
,
"
that
will
do
!
"
<EOS>
---
watch
her
home
again
---
and
do
not
go
away
,
you
may
be
sure
,
know
that
Mrs
Thompson
be
write
her
letter
to
Tally
-
ho
,
and
that
the
letter
would
be
post
presently
.
 
<EOS>
in
about
an
hour
or
so
,
out
come
the
little
girl
again
,
with
the
letter
in
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
up
,
and
say
something
to
the
child
,
whatever
it
may
have
be
;
but
I
could
not
see
the
direction
of
the
letter
,
because
she
hold
it
with
the
seal
upward
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
observe
that
on
the
back
of
the
letter
there
be
what
we
call
a
kiss
---
a
drop
of
wax
by
the
side
of
the
seal
---
and
again
,
you
understand
,
that
be
enough
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
her
post
the
letter
,
wait
till
she
be
go
,
then
go
into
the
shop
,
and
ask
to
see
the
Master
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
come
out
,
I
tell
him
,
"
now
,
I
be
an
Officer
in
the
Detective
Force
;
there
be
a
letter
with
a
kiss
be
post
here
just
now
,
for
a
man
that
I
be
in
search
of
;
and
what
I
have
to
ask
of
you
,
be
,
that
you
will
let
me
look
at
the
direction
of
that
letter
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
civil
---
take
a
lot
of
letter
from
the
box
in
the
window
---
shake
'em
out
on
the
counter
with
the
face
downward
---
and
there
among
'em
be
the
identical
letter
with
the
kiss
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
direct
,
Mr
Thomas
Pigeon
,
Post
Office
,
B
#
#
#
#
,
to
be
leave
till

<EOS>
down
<EOS>
I
go
to
b
#
#
#
#
(
a
hundred
and
twenty
mile
or
so
)
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
early
next
morning
I
go
to
the
Post
Office
;
see
the
gentleman
in
charge
of
that
department
;
tell
him
who
I
be
;
and
that
my
object
be
to
see
,
and
track
,
the
party
that
should
come
for
the
letter
for
Mr
Thomas
Pigeon
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
polite
,
and
say
,
"
You
shall
have
every
assistance
we
can
give
you
;
you
can
wait

and

will
take
care
to
let
you
know
when
anybody

for
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
I
wait
there
three
day
,
and
begin
to
think
that
nobody
ever
WOULD
come
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
the
clerk
whisper
to
me
,
"
here
!
<EOS>
detective
!
 
<EOS>
somebody
's
come
for
the
letter
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
keep
him
a
minute
,
"
say
I
,
and
I
run
round
to
the
outside
of
the
office
.
 
<EOS>
there
I
see
a
young
chap
with
the
appearance
of
an
Ostler
,
hold
a
horse
by
the
bridle
---
stretch
the
bridle
across
the
pavement
,
while
he
wait
at
the
Post
Office
Window
for
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
pat
the
horse
,
and
that
;
and
I
say
to
the
boy
,
"
why
,
this
be
Mr
Jones
's
Mare
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
 
<EOS>
It
an't
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
?
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
very
like
Mr
Jones
's
Mare
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
an't
Mr
Jones
's
Mare
,
anyhow
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
<EOS>
Mr
so
and
<EOS>
so
's
,
of
the
Warwick
Arms
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
up
he
jump
,
and
off
he
go
---
letter
and
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
a
cab
,
follow
on
the
box
,
and
be
so
quick
after
him
that
I
come
into
the
stable
-
yard
of
the
Warwick
Arms
,
by
one
gate
,
just
as
he
come
in
by
another
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
into
the
bar
,
where
there
be
a
young
woman
serve
,
and
call
for
a
glass
of
brandy
-
and
-
water
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
in
directly
,
and
hand
her
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
She
casually
look
at
it
,
without
say
anything
,
and
stick
it
up
behind
the
glass
over
the
chimney
-
piece
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
to
be
do
next
?
   
<EOS>
"
I
turn
it
over
in
my
mind
while
I
drank
my
brandy
-
and
-
water
(
look
pretty
sharp
at
the
letter
the
while
)
,
but
I
could
not
see
my
way
out
of
it
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
try
to
get
lodging
in
the
house
,
but
there
have
be
a
horse
-
fair
,
or
something
of
that
sort
,
and
it
be
full
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
put
up
somewhere
else
,
but
I
come
backwards
and
forwards
to
the
bar
for
a
couple
of
day
,
and
there
be
the
letter
always
behind
the
glass
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
I
think
I
would
write
a
letter
to
Mr
Pigeon
myself
,
and
see
what
that
would
do
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
write
one
,
and
post
it
,
but
I
purposely
address
it
,
Mr
John
Pigeon
,
instead
of
Mr
Thomas
Pigeon
,
to
see
what
that
would
do
.
<EOS>
in
the
morning
(
a
very
wet
morning
it
be
)
<EOS>
I
watch
the
postman
down
the
street
,
and
cut
into
the
bar
,
just
before
he
reach
the
Warwick
Arms
.
 
<EOS>
in
he
come
presently
with
my
letter
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
there
a
Mr
John
Pigeon
stay
here
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
!
---
stop
a
bit
though
,
"
say
the
barmaid
;
and
she
take
down
the
letter
behind
the
glass
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
she
,
"
it
be
Thomas
,
and
he
be
not
stay
here
.
 
<EOS>
Would
you
do
me
a
favour
,
and
post
this
for
me
,
as
it
be
so
wet
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
postman
say
yes
;
she
fold
it
in
another
envelope
,
direct
it
,
and
give
it
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
it
in
his
hat
,
and
away
he
go
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
difficulty
in
find
out
the
direction
of
that
letter
.
<EOS>
It
be
address
Mr
Thomas
Pigeon
,
Post
Office
,
R
#
#
#
#
,
Northamptonshire
,
to
be
leave
till
call
for
.
 
<EOS>
off
I
start
directly
for
r
#
#
#
#
;
I
say
the
same
at
the
Post
Office
there
,
as
I
have
say
at
b
#
#
#
#
;
and
again
I
wait
three
day
before
anybody
come
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
another
chap
on
horseback
come
.
 
<EOS>
"
any
letter
for
Mr
Thomas
Pigeon
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
where
do
you
come
from
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
New
Inn
,
near
R-
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
get
the
letter
,
and
away
he
go
at
a
canter
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
make
my
inquiry
about
the
New
Inn
,
near
r-
,
and
hear
it
be
a
solitary
sort
of
house
,
a
little
in
the
horse
line
,
about
a
couple
of
mile
from
the
station
,
I
think
I
would
go
and
have
a
look
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
it
what
it
have
be
describe
,
and
saunter
in
,
to
look
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
landlady
be
in
the
bar
,
and
I
be
try
to
get
into
conversation
with
her
;
ask
her
how
business
be
,
and
speak
about
the
wet
weather
,
and
so
on
;
when
I
see
,
through
an
open
door
,
three
man
sit
by
the
fire
in
a
sort
of
parlour
,
or
kitchen
;
and
one
of
those
man
,
accord
to
the
description
I
have
of
him
,
be
Tally
-
ho
Thompson
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
go
and
sit
down
among
'em
,
and
try
to
make
thing
agreeable
;
but
they
be
very
shy
---
would
not
talk
at
all
---
look
at
me
,
and
at
one
another
,
in
a
way
quite
the
reverse
of
sociable
.
 
<EOS>
I
reckon
'em
up
,
and
find
that
they
be
all
three
big
man
than
me
,
and
consider
that
their
look
be
ugly
---
that
it
be
a
lonely
place
---
railroad
station
two
mile
off
---
and
night
come
on
---
<EOS>
think
I
could
not
do
well
than
have
a
drop
of
brandy
-
and
-
water
to
keep
my
courage
up
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
call
for
my
brandy
-
and
-
water
;
and
as
I
be
sit
drink
it
by
the
fire
,
Thompson
get
up
and
go
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
the
difficulty
of
it
be
,
that
I
be
not
sure
it
be
Thompson
,
because
I
have
never
set
eye
on
him
before
;
and
what
I
have
want
be
to
be
quite
certain
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
there
be
nothing
for
it
now
,
but
to
follow
,
and
put
a
bold
face
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
him
talk
,
outside
in
the
yard
,
with
the
landlady
.
 
<EOS>
It
turn
out
afterwards
that
he
be
want
by
a
Northampton
officer
for
something
else
,
and
that
,
know
that
officer
to
be
pock
-
mark
(
as
I
be
myself
)
,
he
mistake
me
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
have
observe
,
I
find
him
talk
to
the
landlady
,
outside
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
my
hand
upon
his
shoulder
---
this
way
---
and
say
,
"
Tally
-
ho
Thompson
,
it
be
no
use
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
an
officer
from
London
,
and
I
take
you
into
custody
for
felony

<EOS>
"
that
be
d

d
!
"
say
Tally
-
ho
Thompson
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
go
back
into
the
house
,
and
the
two
friend
begin
to
cut
up
rough
,
and
their
look
do
not
please
me
at
all
,
I
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
the
man
go
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
you
go
to
do
with
him
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
I
be
go
to
do
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
take
him
to
London
to
-
night
,
as
sure
as
I
be
alive
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
alone
here
,
whatever
you
may
think
.
 
<EOS>
You
mind
your
own
business
,
and
keep
yourself
to
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
well
for
you
,
for
I
know
you
both
very
well
.
"
 
<EOS>
I'D
never
see
or
hear
of
'em
in
all
my
life
,
but
my
bouncing
cow
'em
a
bit
,
and
they
keep
off
,
while
Thompson
be
make
ready
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
to
myself
,
however
,
that
they
may
be
come
after
me
on
the
dark
road
,
to
rescue
Thompson
;
<EOS>
so
I
say
to
the
landlady
,
"
what
man
have
you
get
in
the
house
,
Missis
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
not
get
no
man
here
,
"
she
say
,
sulkily
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
get
an
ostler
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
we
have
get
an
ostler
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
let
me
see
him
.
"
<EOS>
presently
he
come
,
and
a
shaggy
-
head
young
fellow
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
"
now
attend
to
me
,
young
man
,
"
say
I
;
"
I
be
a
Detective
Officer
from
London

<EOS>
this
man
's
name
be
Thompson

<EOS>
I
have
take
him
into

I
be
go
to
take
him
to
the

<EOS>
this
story
come
to
a
termination
amidst
general
applause
,
Inspector
Wield
,
after
a
little
grave
smoking
,
fix
his
eye
on
his
host
,
and
thus
deliver
himself
:
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
a
bad
plant
that
of

hand

so
after
I
would
try
in

to
get

I
write
him
a
letter
in
an

say
that
I
would
get
a
horse

shay
to
dispose
of

would
drive
down
next
day
that
he
may
view
the
lot
,

make
an
offer

<EOS>
very
reasonable
it
be
,
I

a
reg'lar
bargain

<EOS>
straw
and
me
then
go
off
to
a

hire
a

down

accordingly
,
with
a

leave
my

shay
near

we
go

<EOS>
in

there
be
a
number
of
strong
fellow
at
work

after
reckon
'em
up

it
be
clear
to
me
that
it
would
not

try
it
on
there

<EOS>
They
be

many
for

<EOS>
We
must

at
first
he

no

he
could
not

then
he
be
not
sure
about
it
,
and
then
he
would
go
and
try
.
 
<EOS>
so
at
last
he
go
up

stair
,
where
there
be
a
sort
of
loft

presently
down
come
my
man
himself
in

sleeve

"
"
well

he

<EOS>
"
yes

I
say
,
"
it
be
rayth
a

you
will
find
it
a

<EOS>
"
I
be
not

<EOS>
He
have
not
any
suspicion
,
and
away
we
go
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
first
thing
that
happen
be
,
that
the
horse
run
away
with
my
friend
(
who
know
no
more
of
driving
than
a
child

when
he
take
a
little
trot
along
the
road
to
show
his
pace

<EOS>
You

when

bolt
be
over

I
would
hear

Livery
Stables

Ecod
,
he
get
in
,
and
we
get
in
,
and
we
drive
along
the
road
,
to
show
him
to
one
of
the
railway
clerk
that
be
hide
in
the
public

because
the

not

I

now
,
Mr

,
I
may
as
well
make
it
all
right

without
waste
any
more

the
fact

,
I
be
Inspector

<EOS>
"
You
do
not

he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do

indeed

"
if
this
be
not

<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
never

I

by
all
mean

let
's
drive
to
the
factory

I

I
;

I
have

once

suppose
we
send

<EOS>
He
see
it
be
no
go
,
so
he
send
for
it
,
and
put
it
on
,
and
we
drive
him
up
to
London

comfortable

this
reminiscence

in

height
of
its
success

make

complexioned

in

soft

wheedle
tone

voice
,
to
relate
the
Butcher

Story

thus
:

It
be
just
about
six
year
ago

now

since
information

give
at

at

"
   
<EOS>
"
when
you
receive
your
instruction
,
"
say
we
,
"
you
go
away
,
and
hold
a
sort
of
Cabinet
Council
together

"
   
<EOS>
the
smooth
-
faced
officer
coaxingly
reply
,
"
<EOS>
Ye

es
.
 
<EOS>
just
so
.
 
<EOS>
We
turn
it
over
among
ourselves
a
good
deal
.
 
<EOS>
It
appear
,
when
we
go
into
it
,
that
the
good
be
sell
by
the
receiver
extraordinarily
cheap

much
cheap
than
they
could
have

by

the

be
in

establishment
of
the
first
respectability

one
of
'em
at
the
West
End

one
down
in
Westminster

<EOS>
after
a
lot
of
watching
and
inquiry
,
and
this
and
that
among
ourselves
,
we
find
that
the
job
be
manage
,
and
the
purchase
of
the
steal
good
make
,
at
a
little
public
-
house
near
Smithfield

down
by
Saint
Bartholomew

where
the
Warehouse
Porters
,
who
be
the
thief

take
'em
for
that
purpose

do
not
you
see
?
<EOS>
and
make
appointment
to
meet
the
people
that
go
between
themselves
and
the
receiver

<EOS>
this
public
-
house
be
principally
use
by
journeyman
butcher
from
the
country
,
out
of
place
,
and
in
want
of
situation
;
so
,
what
do
we
do
,
but
---
ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
---
we
agree
that
I
should
be
dress
up
like
a
butcher
myself
,
and
go
and
live
there
!
"
   
<EOS>
never
,
surely
,
be
a
faculty
of
observation
better
bring
to
bear
upon
a
purpose
,
than
that
which
pick
out
this
officer
for
the
part

<EOS>
nothing
in
all
creation
could
have
suit
him
better

<EOS>
even
while
he
speak

he
become
a
greasy

sleepy
,
shy
,
good
-
natured
,
chuckle
-
headed
,
unsuspicious
,
and
confide
young
butcher

<EOS>
His
very
hair
seem
to
have
suet
in
it
,
as
he
make
it
smooth
upon
his
head
,
and
his
fresh
complexion
to
be
lubricate
by
large
quantity
of
animal
food

so
I

ha
!
"
<EOS>
(
always
with
the
confide
snigger
of
the
foolish
young
butcher
)
<EOS>
"
so
I
dress
myself
in
the
regular
way
,
make
up
a
little
bundle
of
clothe
,
and
go
to
the
public
-
house
,
and
ask
if
I
could
have
a
lodging
there
?
 
<EOS>
They
say
,
"
yes
,
you
can
have
a
lodging
here

I
get
a
bedroom
,
and
settle
myself
down
in
the
tap

<EOS>
there
be
a
number
of
people
about
the
place

come
backwards

forwards
to
the
house

first
one
say

all
that
,
you
know
.
   
<EOS>
"
when
some
of
the
journeyman
Butchers
that
use
the
house
,
find
that
I
want
a
place
,
they
say
,
"
oh
,
we
will
get
you
a
place
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
they
actually
take
me
to
a
sight
of
place
,
in
Newgate
Market
,
Newport
Market
,
Clare
,
Carnaby
<EOS>
---
I
do
not
know
where
all
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
wage
be
---
ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
---
be
not
sufficient
,
and
I
never
could
suit
myself
,
do
not
you
see
?
 
<EOS>
some
of
the
queer
frequenter
of
the
house
be
a
little
suspicious
of
me
at
first
,
and
I
be
oblige
to
be
very
cautious
indeed
how
I
communicate
with
Straw
or
Fendall
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
when
I
go
out
,
pretend
to
stop
and
look
into
the
shop
window
,
and
just
cast
my
eye
round
,
I
use
to
see
some
of
'em
follow
me
;
but
,
be
perhaps
better
accustomed
than
they
think
for
,
to
that
sort
of
thing
,
I
use
to
lead
'em
on
as
far
as
I
think
necessary
or
convenient
---
sometimes
a
long
way
---
and
then
turn
sharp
round
,
and
meet
'em
,
and
say
,
"
oh
,
dear
,
how
glad
I
be
to
come
upon
you
so
fortunate
!
 
<EOS>
this
London
's
such
a
place
,
I
be
blow
if
I
be
not
lose
again
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
then
we
would
go
back
all
together
,
to
the
public
-
house
,
and
---
ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
and
smoke
our
pipe
,
do
not
you
see
?
   
<EOS>
"
They
be
very
attentive
to
me
,
I
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
common
thing
,
while
I
be
live
there
,
for
some
of
'em
to
take
me
out
,
and
show
me
London
.
 
<EOS>
They
show
me
the
prison
---
show
me
Newgate
---
and
when
they
show
me
Newgate
,
I
stop
at
the
place
where
the
porter
pitch
their
load
,
and
say
,
"
oh
dear
,
be
this
where
they
hang
the
man
?
 
<EOS>
oh
Lor
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
!
"
<EOS>
they
say
,
"
what
a
simple
cove
he
be
!
 
<EOS>
that
be
not
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
they
point
out
which
be
it
,
and
<EOS>
I
say
"
Lor
!
"
<EOS>
and
they
say
,
"
now
you
will
know
it
agen
,
will
not
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
and
I
say
I
think
I
should
if
I
try
hard
---
<EOS>
and
I
assure
you
I
keep
a
sharp
look
out
for
the
City
Police
when
we
be
out
in
this
way
,
for
if
any
of
'em
have
happen
to
know
me
,
and
have
speak
to
me
,
it
would
have
be
all
up
in
a
minute
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
by
good
luck
such
a
thing
never
happen
,
and
all
go
on
quiet
:
though
the
difficulty
I
have
in
communicate
with
my
brother
officer
be
quite
extraordinary
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
steal
good
that
be
bring
to
the
public
-
house
by
the
Warehouse
Porters
,
be
always
disposed
of
in
a
back
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
long
time
,
I
never
could
get
into
this
parlour
,
or
see
what
be
do
there
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
sit
smoke
my
pipe
,
like
an
innocent
young
chap
,
by
the
tap
-
room
fire
<EOS>
,
I
would
hear
some
of
the
party
to
the
robbery
,
as
they
come
in
and
out
,
say
softly
to
the
landlord
,
"
who
be
that
?
<EOS>
what
do
he
do
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
bless
your

say
the
landlord
,
"
he
be

him

<EOS>
so
,
in
course
of
time
,
they
be
so
convinced
of
my
be
green
,
and
get
to
be
so
accustomed
to
me
,
that
I
be
as
free
of
the
parlour
as
any
of
'em
,

I
have
see
as
much
as
seventy

there

in

after
the
sale
the
buyer
always
stand
treat

hot
supper

dinner

what

they
would
say
on

foremost

It

concern
the
murder
of
the

Eliza

some
year

over
in
the
Waterloo

She
be
commonly
call

because
of
her
handsome
appearance

her
proud
way
of
carry
of
herself

and
when
I
see
the
poor
Countess
(
I
have
know

lie
dead

with
her
throat
cut

you
will
believe
me

of
reflection
calculate
to
make
a
man
rather
low
in

spirit

come
into
my
head

<EOS>
"
that
be
neither
here

there

<EOS>
I
go
to
the
house
the
morning
after
the
murder
,
and
examine
the
body
,
and
make
a
general
observation
of
the
bedroom
where
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
turn
down
the
pillow
of
the
bed
with
my
hand

I
find
,
underneath
it
,
a
pair
of
glove

<EOS>
a

of
gentleman
's
dress
glove
,
very
dirty

and
inside
the
lining
,
the

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
sir

I
take
them
glove
away

"
Wield

"
he

,
"
there
be
no

this
be
a
discovery

may
lead
to
something
very
important

what
you
have
get
to
do

Wield
,
be
,
to
find
out
the
owner

these
glove

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
of
the
same
opinion

of
course
,
and
I
go
at
it
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
at
the
glove
pretty
narrowly
,
and
it
be
my
opinion
that
they
have
be
clean
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
smell
of
sulphur
and
rosin
about
'em
,
you
know
,
which
clean
glove
usually
have
,
more
or
less
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
'em
over
to
a
friend
of
mine
at
Kennington
,
who
be
in
that
line
,

I
put
it
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
you

have
these

you

I.

not

he
;
"
I
have
a

distinct
idea
who
DIDN'T
clean
'em

that
be
myself

<EOS>
but
I
will
tell
you
what
,
Wield
,
there
be
not
above
eight

nine
reg'lar
glove

cleaner

I

I
can
give
you
their
address

you
may
find
out
,
by
that
mean
,
who
do
clean

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
accordingly
,
he
give
me
the
direction
,
and
I
go
here
,
and
I
go
there
,
and
I
look
up
this
man
,
and
I
look
up
that
man
;
but
,
though
they
all
agree
that
the

have
be
clean
,
I
could
not

from
the
Surrey
side

quite
beat

very
much
vexed

disappointed

a

worth
of
entertainment
at
the
Lyceum
Theatre
to
freshen
myself
up

<EOS>
so
I
go
into

at

I
sit
myself
down
next

modest

him
fifteen

twenty

Mr

all
down

head

knock
about
on

floor

bar

perhaps
you
never
see
such
a
scene

confusion

,
we
stick
to
our
man

Mr

as
good

take
'em
all

piece

work

get
'em
secure

we
do
it
at
last

we
search
'em
;

nothing
be
find
upon

they
be
lock
up

a
pretty
state

heat
we
be
in
by
that
time

I
assure
you
!

"
I
be
very
blank
over
it

myself
,
to
think
that
the
prop
have
be
pass
away
;
and
I
say
to
Witchem
,
when
we
have
set
'em
to
right
,
and
be
cool
ourselves
along
with
Mr
Tatt
,
"
we
do
not
take
much
by
this
move

anyway

nothing

only
the

what
do
you

in

palm

his

there

safe

sound

why
,
in

of
wonder

Mr

in
astonishment

how
do
you
come
by

I
will
tell
you
how
I
come
by
it

say
he
.
 
<EOS>

I
see
which
of
'em
take
it
;
and
when
we
be
all
down
on
the
floor
together
,
knock
about
,
I
just
give
him
a
little
touch
on
the
back
of
his
hand
,
as
I
know
his
pal
would
;
and
he

I
then

when

my
Christmas
greeting

my
parting

<EOS>
STOP
THIEF

<EOS>
and
to
know
that
I
MUST
be
stop
,
come
what
will
.
 
<EOS>
to
know
that
I
be
no
match
for
this
individual
energy
and
keenness
,
or
this
organised
and
steady
system
!
 
<EOS>
come
across
the
street
,
here
,
and
,
enter
by
a
little
shop
and
yard
,
examine
these
intricate
passage
and
door
,
contrive
for
escape
,
flapping
and
counter
-
flapping
,
like
the
lid
of
the
conjurer
's
box
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
avail
they
?
 
<EOS>
who
get
in
by
a
nod
,
and
show
their
secret
work
to
us
?
<EOS>
Inspector
Field
.
   
<EOS>
do
not
forget
the
old
Farm
House
,
Parker

<EOS>
Parker
be
not
the
man
to
forget
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
be

.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
old
Manor
-
House
of
these
part
,
and
stand
in
the
country
once
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
perhaps
,
there
be
something
,
which
be
not
the
beastly
street
,
to
see
from
the
shattered
low
front
of
the
overhanging
wooden
house
we
be
pass
under
---
shut
up
now
,
paste
over
with
bill
about
the
literature
and
drama
of
the
Mint
,
and
moulder
away
.
 
<EOS>
this
long
pave
yard
be
a
paddock
or
a
garden
once
,
or
a
court
in
front
of
the
Farm
House
.
 
<EOS>
perchance
,
with
a
dovecot
in
the
centre
,
and
fowl
peek
about
---
with
fair
elm
tree
,
then
,
where
discolour
chimney
-
stack
and
gable
be
now
---
noisy
,
then
,
with
rook
which
have
yield
to
a
different
sort
of
rookery
.
 
<EOS>
It

<EOS>
a
good
many
of
these

<EOS>
this

(
smooth
down

hair
of

,
read
a
Sunday
paper
)
be
a
pupil
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I

<EOS>
He

He

<EOS>
---
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
the
kitchen
(
the
whole

in
ecstasy
with
this
impromptu
"
chaff
"
)
sit
a
young
,
modest
,
gentle
-
look
creature
,
with
a
beautiful
child
in
her
lap
.
 
<EOS>
She
seem
to
belong
to
the
company
,
but
be
so
strangely
unlike
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
such
a
pretty
,
quiet
face
and
voice
,
and
be
so
proud
to
hear
the
child
admire
---
think
you
would
hardly
believe
that
he
be
only
nine
month
old
!
 
<EOS>
be
she
as
bad
as
the
rest
<EOS>
,
I
wonder
?
<EOS>
inspectorial
experience
do
not
engender
a
belief
contrariwise
,
but
prompt
the
answer
,
not
a
ha'porth
of
difference
!
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
piano
go
in
the
old
Farm
House
as
we
approach
.
 
<EOS>
It

<EOS>
have
no
objection
,
Mr

,
to

be
bring
,
but
wish

be
at
early
hour
,
<EOS>
the
lodger
complain
of
ill

conwenience
.
 
<EOS>
Inspector
Field
be
polite
and
soothing
---
know
his
woman
and
the
sex
.
 
<EOS>
Deputy
(
a
girl
in
this
case
)
show
the
way
up
a
heavy
,
broad
old
staircase
,
keep
very
clean
,
into
clean
room
where
many
sleeper
be
,
and
where
paint
panel
of
an
old
time
look
strangely
on
the
truckle
bed
.
 
<EOS>
the
sight
of
whitewash
and
the
smell
of
soap
---
two
thing
we
seem
by
this
time
to
have
part
from
in
infancy
---
make
the
old
Farm
House
a
phenomenon
,
and
connect
themselves
with
the
so
curiously
misplace
picture
of
the
pretty
mother
and
child
long
after
we
have
leave
it
,
---
long
after
we
have
leave
,
besides
,
the
neighbouring
nook
with
something
of
a
rustic
flavour
in
it
yet
,
where
once
,
beneath
a
low
wooden
colonnade
still
stand
as
of
yore
,
the
eminent
Jack
Sheppard
condescend
to
regale
himself
,
and
where
,
now
,
two
old
bachelor
brother
in
broad
hat
(
who
be
whisper
in
the
Mint
to
have
make
a
compact
long
ago
that
if
either
should
ever
marry
,
he
must
forfeit
his
share
of
the
joint
property
)
<EOS>
still
keep
a
sequestered
tavern
,
and
sit
o
'
night
smoking
pipe
in
the
bar
,
among
ancient
bottle
and
glass
,
as
our
eye
behold
them
.
   
<EOS>
how
go
the
night
now
?
 
<EOS>
Saint

<EOS>
Parker

,
for
Williams
be
already
wait
over
in
the
region
of
Ratcliffe
Highway
,
to
show
the
house
where
the
sailor
dance
.
   
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
know
where
Inspector
Field
be
bear
.
 
<EOS>
in
Ratcliffe
Highway
,
I
would
have
answer
with
confidence
,
but
for
his
be
equally
at
home
wherever
we
go
.
 
<EOS>
he
do
not
trouble
his
head
as
I
do
,
about
the
river
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
he
do
not
care
for
its
creeping
,
black
and
silent
,
on
our
right
there
,
rush
through
sluice
-
gate
,
lap
at
pile
and
post
and
iron
ring
,
hide
strange
thing
in
its
mud
,
run
away
with
suicide
and
accidentally
drown
body
faster
than
midnight
funeral
should
,
and
acquire
such
various
experience
between
its
cradle
and
its
grave
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
no
mystery
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
be
there
not
the
Thames
Police
!
   
<EOS>
accordingly
,
Williams
lead
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
a
little
late
,
for
some
of
the
house
be
already
close
.
 
<EOS>
no
matter
.
 
<EOS>
You

<EOS>
all

Inspector
Field

<EOS>
all
pass
him
,
freely
and
good
-
humouredly
,
wheresoever
he
want
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
so
thoroughly
be
all
these
house
open
to
him
and
our
local
guide
,
that
,
grant
that
sailor
must
be
entertain
in
their
own
way
---
as
I
suppose
they
must
,
and
have
a
right
to
be
<EOS>
---
I
hardly
know
how
such
place
could
be
better
regulate
.
 
<EOS>
not
that
I
call
the
company
very
select
,
or
the
dancing
very
graceful
---
even
so
graceful
as
that
of
the
German
Sugar
Bakers
,
<EOS>
whose
assembly
,
by
the
Minories
,
we
stop
to
visit
---
but
there
be
watchful
maintenance
of
order
in
every
house
,
and
swift
expulsion
where
need
be
.
 
<EOS>
even
in
the
midst
of
drunkenness
,
both
of
the
lethargic
kind
and
the
lively
,
there
be
sharp
landlord
supervision
,
and
pocket
be
in
less
peril
than
out
of
door
.
 
<EOS>
these
house
show
,
singularly
,
how
much
of
the
picturesque
and
romantic
there
truly
be
in
the
sailor
,
require
to
be
especially
address
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
song
(
sing
in
a
hailstorm
of
halfpence
,
which
be
pitch
at
the
singer
without
the
least
tenderness
for
the
time
or
tune
---
mostly
from
great
roll
of
copper
carry
for
the
purpose
---
and
which
he
occasionally
dodge
like
shoot
as
they
fly
near
his

)
be
of
the
sentimental
sea
sort

nothing

Imperturbable

both

and
marshal
us
the

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
We

when

<EOS>
Detective

<EOS>
We

<EOS>
You

if

at

We

state
of
madness
in
the
passage
with
his
back
against
a
door
that
shut
off
the
upper

<EOS>
We
observe
,
in
other

a
ferocious

Bark

She
stop
the

at

she
would
pay
the

then
,
which
she
do

though
there
be
a

about

however

well

the

a

in

out

never

hardly

run
along

at

in

that
she
have
be
quarrel
at
the
Hero
of
Waterloo

and
it
be
bring
in

.
 
<EOS>
(
one
of
the
result
of
Waterloo
's
experience
be
,
that
there
be
a

of

about

"

he

stoop
down

take

He

his

his

not

no

in
my

on

of
his

sometimes

"
Lord

to
some

<EOS>
He
come
back

he
do
,
as
reg'lar

can

He
always
turn
down

come
up

a

do
it
every

"
   
<EOS>
I
ask
Waterloo
if
he
have
give
his
mind
to
the
possibility
of
this
particular
customer
go
down
the
water
-
stair
at
three
o'clock
some
morning

and
never
come
up
again
?
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
think
that
of
him
,
he
reply
.
 
<EOS>
in
fact
,
it
be
Waterloo
's
opinion
,
found
on
his
observation
of
that
file
,
that
he
know'd
a
trick
worth
two
of

"

<EOS>
have
relate
these
anecdote
in

natural
manner

which
be
the
good

in

world
for

genuine
nature

our

ask
whether
he

not
be
occasionally
the

of
assault

battery
in

execution
of
his
duty
?
 
<EOS>
Waterloo
recover
his
spirit
,
instantly
dash
into
a
new
branch
of
his
subject
.
 
<EOS>
We
learn
how
"
both
these

here
he
point
to
the
place
where
two
front
tooth
be
not

who
one
night
make
a
dash
at
him
(
Waterloo

while
his
(
the
ugly
customer

)
pal
and
coadjutor
make
a
dash
at
the
toll
-
take
apron
where
the
money

pocket
be
;
<EOS>
how
Waterloo
,
let
the
tooth
go
(
to
Blazes
<EOS>
,
he
observe
indefinitely
)
,
grapple
with
the
apron
-
seizer
,
permit
the
ugly
one
to
run
away
;
and
how
he
save
the
bank
,
and
capture
his
man
,
and
consign
him
to
fine
and
imprisonment
.
 
<EOS>
also
how
,
on
another
night
,
"
a
Cove
"
lay
hold
of
Waterloo
,
then
preside
at
the
horse
-
gate
of
his
bridge
,
and
throw
him
unceremoniously
over
his
knee
,
have
first
cut
his
head
open
with
his
whip

<EOS>
how
Waterloo
"
get
right

"
and
start
after
the
Cove
all
down
the
Waterloo
Road
,
through
Stamford
Street
,
and
round
to
the
foot
of
Blackfriars
Bridge
,
where
the
Cove
"
cut
into
"
a
public
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
how
Waterloo
cut
in
too
;
but
how
an
aider
and
abettor
of
the
Cove
's
,
who
happen
to
be
take
a
promiscuous
drain
at
the
bar
,
stop
Waterloo
;
and
the
Cove
cut
out
again
,
run
across
the
road
down
Holland
Street
,
and
where
not
,
and
into
a
beer
-
shop
.
 
<EOS>
how
Waterloo
break
away
from
his
detainer
be
close
upon
the
Cove
's
heel
,
attend
by
no
end
of
people
,
who
,
see
him
run
with
the
blood
stream
down
his

,
think
something
bad
be
"
up

"
and
roar
Fire

<EOS>
and
Murder
!
<EOS>
on
the
hopeful
chance
of
the
matter
in
hand
be
one
or
both
.
 
<EOS>
how
the
Cove
be
ignominiously
take
,
in
a
shed
where
he
have
run
to
hide
,
and
how
at
the
Police
Court
they
at
first
want
to
make
a
session
job
of
it
;
but
eventually
Waterloo
be
allow
to
be
"
speak
to
,
"
and
the
Cove
make
it
square
with
Waterloo
by
pay
his
doctor
's
bill
<EOS>
(
W
be
lay
up
for
a
week
)
and
give
him
"
three
,
ten
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
likewise
we
learn
what
we
have
faintly
suspect
before
,
that
your
sporting
amateur
on
the
Derby
day
,
albeit
a
captain
,
can
be
---
"
if
he
be
,
"
as
Captain
Bobadil
observe
,
"
so
generously
minded
"
---
anything
but
a
man
of
honour
and
a
gentleman
;
not
sufficiently
gratify
his
nice
sense
of
humour
by
the
witty
scattering
of
flour
and
rotten
egg
on
obtuse
civilian
,
but
require
the
further
excitement
of
"
bilk
the
toll
,
"
and
"
pitch
into
"
Waterloo
,
and
"
cut
him
about
the
head
with
his
whip
;
"
finally
be
,
when
call
upon
to
answer
for
the
assault
,
what
Waterloo
describe
as
"
Minus
,
"
or
,
as
I
humbly
conceive
it
,
not
to
be
find
.
 
<EOS>
Likewise
do
Waterloo
inform
us
,
in
reply
to
my
inquiry
,
admiringly
and
deferentially
prefer
through
my
friend
Pea
,
that
the
taking
at
the
Bridge
have
more
than
double
in
amount
,
since
the
reduction
of
the
toll
one
half
.
 
<EOS>
and
be
ask
if
the
aforesaid
taking
include
much
bad
money
,
Waterloo
respond
,
with
a
look
far
deep
than
the
deep
part
of
the
river
,
he
should
think
not
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
so
retired
into
his
shawl
for
the
rest
of
the
night
.
   
<EOS>
then
do
Pea
and
I
once
more
embark
in
our
four
-
oare
galley
,
and
glide
swiftly
down
the
river
with
the
tide
.
 
<EOS>
and
while
the
shrewd
East
rasp
and
notch
us
,
as
with
jagged
razor
,
do
my
friend
Pea
impart
to
me
confidence
of
interest
relate
to
the
Thames
Police
;
we
,
between
while
,
find
"
duty
boat
"
hang
in
dark
corner
under
bank
,
like
weed
---
<EOS>
our
own
be
a
"
supervision
boat
"
---
and
they
,
as
they
report
"
all
right
!
"
<EOS>
flash
their
hide
light
on
us
,
and
we
flash
our
on
them
.
 
<EOS>
these
duty
boat
have
one
sitter
in
each
:
an
Inspector
:
and
be
row
"
Ran
-
dan
,
"
which
---
for
the
information
of
those
who
never
graduate
,
as
I
be
once
proud
to
do
,
under
a
fireman
-
waterman
and
winner
of
Kean
's
Prize
Wherry
:
who
,
in
the
course
of
his
tuition
,
take
hundred
of
gallon
of
rum
and
egg
(
at
my
expense
)
at
the
various
house
of
note
above
and
below
bridge
;
not
by
any
mean
because
he
like
it
,
but
to
cure
a
weakness
in
his
liver
,
for
which
the
faculty
have
particularly
recommend
it
---
may
be
explain
as
row
by
three
man
,
two
pull
an
oar
each
,
and
one
a
pair
of
scull
.
   
<EOS>
thus
,
float
down
our
black
highway
,
sullenly
frown
upon
by
the
knit
brow
of
Blackfriars
,
Southwark
,
and
London
,
each
in
his
lowering
turn
,
I
be
show
by
my
friend
Pea
that
there
be
,
in
the
Thames
Police
Force
,
whose
district
extend
from
Battersea
to
Barking
Creek
,
ninety
-
eight
man
,
eight
duty
boat
,
and
two
supervision
boat
;
and
that
these
go
about
so
silently
,
and
lie
in
wait
in
such
dark
place
,
and
so
seem
to
be
nowhere
,
and
so
may
be
anywhere
,
that
they
have
gradually
become
a
police
of
prevention
,
keep
the
river
almost
clear
of
any
great
crime
,
even
while
the
increase
vigilance
on
shore
have
make
it
much
harder
than
of
yore
to
live
by
"
thieve
"
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
to
the
various
kind
of
water
-
thief
,
say
my
friend
Pea
<EOS>
,
there
be
the
Tier
-
ranger
,
who
silently
drop
alongside
the
tier
of
shipping
in
the
Pool
,
by
night
,
and
who
,
go
to
the
companion
-
head
,
listen
for
two
snore
---
snore
number
one
,
the
skipper
's
;
snore
number
two
,
the
mate
's
---
mate
and
skipper
always
snore
great
gun
,
and
be
dead
sure
to
be
hard
at
it
if
they
have
turn
in
and
be
asleep
.
<EOS>
hear
the
double
fire
,
down
go
the
Rangers
into
the
skipper
'
cabin
;
grope
for
the
skipper
'
inexpressible
,
which
it
be
the
custom
of
those
gentleman
to
shake
off
,
watch
,
money
,
brace
,
boot
,
and
all
together
,
on
the
floor
;
and
therewith
make
off
as
silently
as
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
then
there
be
the
Lumpers
,
or
labourer
employ
to
unload
vessel
.
 
<EOS>
They
wear
loose
canvas
jacket
with
a
broad
hem
in
the
bottom
,
turn
inside
,
so
as
to
form
a
large
circular
pocket
in
which
they
could
conceal
,
like
clown
in
pantomime
,
package
of
surprising
size
.
 
<EOS>
a
great
deal
of
property
be
steal
in
this
manner
<EOS>
(
pea
confide
to
me
)
from
steamer
;
first
,
because
steamer
carry
a
large
number
of
small
package
than
other
ship
;
next
,
because
of
the
extreme
rapidity
with
which
they
be
oblige
to
be
unladen
for
their
return
voyage
.
 
<EOS>
the
Lumpers
dispose
of
their
booty
easily
to
marine
store
dealer
,
and
the
only
remedy
to
be
suggest
be
that
marine
store
shop
should
be
license
,
and
thus
bring
under
the
eye
of
the
police
as
rigidly
as
public
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
lumper
also
smuggle
good
ashore
for
the
crew
of
vessel
.
 
<EOS>
the
smuggling
of
tobacco
be
so
considerable
,
that
it
be
well
worth
the
while
of
the
seller
of
smuggle
tobacco
to
use
hydraulic
press
,
to
squeeze
a
single
pound
into
a
package
small
enough
to
be
contain
in
an
ordinary
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
next
,
say
my
friend
Pea
<EOS>
,
there
be
the
Truckers
---
less
thief
than
smuggler
,
whose
business
it
be
to
land
more
considerable
parcel
of
good
than
the
Lumpers
could
manage
.
 
<EOS>
They
sometimes
sell
article
of
grocery
and
so
forth
,
to
the
crew
,
in
order
to
cloak
their
real
calling
,
and
get
aboard
without
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
many
of
them
have
boat
of
their
own
,
and
make
money
.
 
<EOS>
besides
these
,
there
be
the
Dredgermen
,
who
,
under
pretence
of
dredge
up
coal
and
such
like
from
the
bottom
of
the
river
,
hang
about
barge
and
other
undecked
craft
,
and
when
they
see
an
opportunity
,
throw
any
property
they
could
lay
their
hand
on
overboard
:
in
order
slyly
to
dredge
it
up
when
the
vessel
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
they
dexterously
use
their
dredge
to
whip
away
anything
that
may
lie
within
reach
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
them
be
mighty
neat
at
this
,
and
the
accomplishment
be
call
dry
dredging
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
there
be
a
vast
deal
of
property
,
such
as
copper
nail
,
sheathing
,
hardwood
,
&
c
,
habitually
bring
away
by
shipwright
and
other
workman
from
their
employer
'
yard
,
and
dispose
of
to
marine
store
dealer
,
many
of
whom
escape
detection
through
hard
swearing
,
and
their
extraordinary
artful
way
of
account
for
the
possession
of
steal
property
.
 
<EOS>
likewise
,
there
be
special
-
plead
practitioner
,

afterwards

who

<EOS>
We
be
now
go
in
and
out
,
with
little
noise
and
great
nicety
,
among
the
tier
of
shipping
,
whose
many
hull
,
lie
close
together
,
rise
out
of
the
water
like
black
street
.
 
<EOS>
here
and
there
,
a
Scotch
,
an
Irish
,
or
a
foreign
steamer
,
get
up
her
steam
as
the
tide
make
,
look
,
with
her
great
chimney
and
high
side
,
like
a
quiet
factory
among
the
common
building
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
the
street
open
into
clear
space
,
now
contract
into
alley
;
but
the
tier
be
so
like
house
,
in
the
dark
,
that
I
could
almost
have
believe
myself
in
the
narrow
bye
-
way
of
Venice
.
<EOS>
everything
be
wonderfully
still
;
for
,
it
want
full
three
hour
of
flood
,
and
nothing
seem
awake
but
a
dog
here
and
there
.
   
<EOS>
so
we
take
no
tier
-
ranger
captive
,
nor
any
Lumpers
,
nor
trucker
,
nor
dredgerman
,
nor
other
evil
-
dispose
person

but
go
ashore
at
Wapping
,
where
the
old
Thames
Police
office
be
now
a
station
-
house
,
and
where
the
old
Court
,
with
its
cabin
window
look
on
the
river
,
be
a
quaint
charge
room
:
with
nothing
bad
in
it
usually
than
a
stuffed
cat
in
a
glass
case
,
and
a
portrait
,
pleasant
to
behold
,
of
a
rare
old
Thames
Police
officer
,
Mr
Superintendent
Evans
,
now
succeed
by
his
son
.
 
<EOS>
We
look
over
the
charge
book
,
admirably
keep
,
and
find
the
prevention
so
good
that
there
be
not
five
hundred
entry
(
include
drunken
and
disorderly
)
in
a
whole
year
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
we
look
into
the
store
-
room
;
where
there
be
an
oakum
smell
,
and
a
nautical
seasoning
of
dreadnought
clothing
,
rope
yarn
,
boat
-
hook
,
scull
and
oar
,
spare
stretcher
,
rudder
,
pistol
,
cutlass

and
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
into
the
cell
,
air
high
up
in
the
wooden
wall
through
an
opening
like
a
kitchen
plate
-
rack
:
wherein
there
be
a
drunken
man
,
not
at
all
warm
,
and
very
wishful
to
know
if
it
be
morne
yet

<EOS>
then
,
into
a
well
sort
of
watch

ward
room

where
there
be
a

ready

apply
to
any
unfortunate
creature
who
may
be
bring
in
apparently
drown
.
 
<EOS>
finally
,
we
shake
hand
with
our
worthy
friend
Pea
,
and
run
all
the
way
to
Tower
Hill
,
under
strong
police
suspicion
occasionally
,
before

the

,
though

much
better
adapt

the
comprehension
and
to
the
circumstance
of
the
hearer
.
 
<EOS>
the
usual
supplication
be
offer
,
with
more
than
the
usual
significancy
in
such
a
place
,
for
the
fatherless
child
and
widow
,
for
all
sick
person
and
young
child

for
all
that

desolate

for
the
comforting

for
the
raising

the

<EOS>
among

,
be
some
evil

not

perhaps
that
kind

keep
away
.
 
<EOS>
generally
,
the
face
(
those
of

be

Mumbling

creep
in
through

,
from
the
paved
yard
;
shade
their
listening
ear
,
or
blink
eye
,
with

pore
over
their

<EOS>
there

all
bonnet

cloak
without

continually
wipe
their

dirty
duster

and
there
be
ugly
old
crone
,
both
male

with
a
ghastly
kind
of
contentment
upon
them
which
be
not

all
comfort

<EOS>
upon
the
whole

it
be
the
dragon

Pauperism

in

toothless

fangless

<EOS>
when

that
Sunday
morning

through
the
little

poverty
enclose
within
the

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
in
a
room
open
from
a
squalid
yard

where
a
number
of
listless
woman
be
lounge
to

fro
,
try
to
get
warm
in
the
ineffectual
sunshine
of
the
tardy
May
morning
---
in
the
"
Itch
Ward
,
"
not
to
compromise
the
truth
---
a
woman
such
as
HOGARTH
have
often
draw

hurriedly
get
on
her
gown
before
a
dusty
fire
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
the

of
that
insalubrious
department

herself
a

flabby

raw

boned

untidy

unpromising

coarse
of

need
be

<EOS>
but
,
on
be
speak
to
about
the
patient
whom
she
have
in
charge
,
she
turn
round
,
with
her
shabby
gown
half
on
,
half
off

and
fall
a
crying
with
all
her
might
.
 
<EOS>
not
for
show
,
not
querulously
,
not
in
any
mawkish
sentiment
,
but
in
the
deep
grief
and
affliction
of
her
heart
;
turn
away
her
dishevelled
head
:
sob
most
bitterly
,
wring
her
hand
,
and
let
fall
abundance
of
great
tear
,
that
choke
her
utterance
.
<EOS>
what

<EOS>
the
drop
child
seem
too
small

poor
a

for
death

death

take
it

and
already
its
diminutive

be
neatly
wash

compose

I

a
voice
from
Heaven
say

It
shall
be
well
for
thee

o

in

good
manner

domestic
servant

have

I

no

,
on
account
of
be

epileptic
fit

require
to

remove
under
the

a
very
bad
one

She
be
by
no

stuff

or
the

breeding
,
or
the
same
experience
,
or
in
the
same
state
of
mind
,
as
those
by
whom
she
be
surround
;
and
she
pathetically
complain
that
the
daily
association
and
the
nightly
noise
make
her
bad
,
and
be
drive
her
mad
---
which
be
perfectly
evident
.
 
<EOS>
the
case
be
note
for
inquiry
and
redress
,
but
she
say
she
have
already
be
there
for
some
week
.
   
<EOS>
if
this
girl
have
steal
her
mistress
's
watch

I
do
not
hesitate
to
say
she
would
have
be
infinitely
well
off

<EOS>
We
have
come
to
this
absurd
,
this
dangerous
,
this
monstrous
pass
,
that
the
dishonest
felon
be
,
in
respect
of
cleanliness
,
order
,
diet
,
and
accommodation
,
better
provide
for
,
and
take
care
of

than
the
honest
pauper

<EOS>
and
this
convey
no
special
imputation
on
the
workhouse
of
the
parish
of
St

so
-

so
,
where
,
on
the
contrary
,
I
see
many
thing
to
commend
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
agreeable
,
recollect
that
most
infamous
and
atrocious
enormity
commit
at
Tooting

an
enormity
which
,
a
hundred
year
hence
,
will
still
be
vividly
remember
in
the
bye

way
of
english
life

and
which
have
do
more
to
engender
a
gloomy
discontent
and
suspicion
among
many
thousand
of
the
people
than
all
the
chartist
leader
could
have
do
in
all
their
life
---
to
find
the
pauper
child
in
this
workhouse
look
robust
and
well
,
and
apparently
the
object
of
very
great
care
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
Infant
School

airy
room

little
creature

at
dinner

eat
their
potato
heartily
,
be
not
cow
by
the
presence

strange
visitor

stretch
out
their
small

shake

pleasant
confidence

he
could

their
aspiration
after
well

sensibility

a

out

back
his

clap
it
down

very
good

speak
with
perfect

come
forward
from

the

these
thing

of
all
the
tender
thing
there
be
to
think
about

may
have
be
in

he
think

with

that
there
be
a
fellow

feeling
in
the
pauper
nurse

appear
to
make
them
more
kind

the
race

he
muse
upon
the
Future

old
child
lie
around
him
in

place

and
think
it
best

perhaps

all
thing
consider

that

it

Age

I
hope
you
may
know
when
that
be

for
I
be
sure
I
do
not
,
though
I
have
try
hard
to
find
out
,
there
live
in
a
rich
and
fertile
country
,
a
powerful
Prince
whose
name
be
BULL
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
go
through
a
great
deal
of
fighting
,
in
his
time
,
about
all
sort
of
thing
,
include
nothing
;
but
,
have
gradually
settle
down
to
be
a
steady
,
peaceable
,
good
-
natured
,
corpulent
,
rather
sleepy
Prince
.
   
<EOS>
this
Puissant
Prince
be
marry
to
a
lovely
Princess
whose
name
be
Fair
Freedom
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
bring
him
a
large
fortune
,
and
have
bear
him
an
immense
number
of
child
,
and
have
set
them
to
spin
,
and
farming
,
and
engineering
,
and
soldier
,
and
sailoring
,
and
doctor
,
and
lawyere
,
and
preaching

all
kind

<EOS>
the
coffer
of
Prince
Bull
be
full
of
treasure
,
his
cellar
be
cram
with
delicious
wine
from
all
part
of
the
world
,
the
rich
gold
and
silver
plate
that
ever
be
see
adorn
his
sideboard
,
his
son
be
strong
,
his
daughter
be
handsome

and
in
short
you
may
have
suppose
that
if
there
ever
live
upon
earth
a
fortunate
and
happy
Prince
,
the
name
of
that
Prince
,
take
him
for
all
in
all
,
be
assuredly
Prince
Bull
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
appearance
,
as
we
all
know
,
be
not
always
to
be
trust
---
far
from
it
;
and
if
they
have
lead
you
to
this
conclusion
respect
Prince
Bull
,
they
would
have
lead
you
wrong
as
they
often
have
lead
me
.
   
<EOS>
for
,
this
good
Prince
have
two
sharp
thorn
in
his
pillow

two
hard
knob
in
his
crown
,
two
heavy
load
on
his
mind
,
two
unbridled
nightmare
in
his
sleep
,
two
rock
ahead
in
his
course
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
by
any
mean
get
servant
to
suit
him
,
and
he
have
a
tyrannical
old
godmother
,
whose
name
be
Tape
.
   
<EOS>
She
be
a
fairy
,
this
tape
,
and
be
a
bright
red
all
over
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
disgustingly
prim
and
formal
,
and
could
never
bend
herself
a
hair
's
breadth
this
way
or
that
way
,
out
of
her
naturally
crooked
shape
.
<EOS>
but
,
she
be
very
potent
in
her
wicked
art
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
stop
the
fast
thing
in
the
world
,
change
the
strong
thing
into
the
weak
,
and
the
most
useful
into
the
most
useless
.
 
<EOS>
to
do
this
she
have
only
to
put
her
cold
hand
upon
it
,
and
repeat
her
own
name
,
Tape
.
 
<EOS>
then
it
wither
away
.
   
<EOS>
at
the
Court
of
Prince
Bull
---
at
least
I
do
not
mean
literally
at
his
court
,
because
he
be
a
very
genteel
Prince
,
and
readily
yield
to
his
godmother
when
she
always
reserve
that
for
his
hereditary
Lords
and
Ladies
---
in
the
dominion
of
Prince
Bull
,
among
the
great
mass
of
the
community
who
be
call
in
the
language
of
that
polite
country
the
Mobs
and
the
Snobs
,
be
a
number
of
very
ingenious
man
,
who
be
always
busy
with
some
invention
or
other
,
for
promote
the
prosperity
of
the
Prince
's
subject
,
and
augment
the
Prince
's
power
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
whenever
they
submit
their
model
for
the
Prince
's
approval
,
his
godmother
step
forward
,
lay
her
hand
upon
them
,
and
say
"
tape
.
"
 
<EOS>
hence
it
come
to
pass
,
that
when
any
particularly
good
discovery
be
make
,
the
discoverer
usually
carry
it
off
to
some
other
Prince
,
in
foreign
part
,
who
have
no
old
godmother
who
say
Tape
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
not
on
the
whole
an
advantageous
state
of
thing
for
Prince
Bull
,
to
the
good
of
my
understanding
.
   
<EOS>
the
bad
of
it
be
,
that
Prince
Bull
have
in
course
of
year
lapse
into
such
a
state
of
subjection
to
this
unlucky
godmother
,
that
he
never
make
any
serious
effort
to
rid
himself
of
her
tyranny
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
say
this
be
the
bad
of
it
,
but
there
I
be
wrong
,
because
there
be
a
bad
consequence
still
,
behind
.
 
<EOS>
the
Prince
's
numerous
family
become
so
downright
sick
and
tired
of
Tape
,
that
when
they
should
have
help
the
Prince
out
of
the
difficulty
into
which
that
evil
creature
lead
him
,
they
fall
into
a
dangerous
habit
of
moodily
keep
away
from
him
in
an
impassive
and
indifferent
manner
,
as
though
they
have
quite
forget
that
no
harm
could
happen
to
the
Prince
their
father
,
without
its
inevitably
affect
themselves
.
   
<EOS>
such
be
the
aspect
of
affair
at
the
court
of
Prince
Bull
,
when
this
great
Prince
find
it
necessary
to
go
to
war
with
Prince
Bear
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
for
some
time
very
doubtful
of
his
servant
,
who
,
besides
be
indolent
and
addict
to
enrich
their
family
at
his
expense
,
domineer
over
him
dreadfully
;
threaten
to
discharge
themselves
if
they
be
find
the
least
fault
with
,
pretend
that
they
have
do
a
wonderful
amount
of
work
when
they
have
do
nothing
,
make
the
most
unmeaning
speech
that
ever
be
hear
in
the
Prince
's
name
,
and
uniformly
show
themselves
to
be
very
inefficient
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
though
,
that
some
of
them
have
excellent
character
from
previous
situation
be
not
to
be
deny
.
 
<EOS>
well
;
Prince
Bull
call
his
servant
together
,
and
say
to
them
one
and
all
,
"
send
out
my
army
against
Prince
Bear
.
 
<EOS>
Clothe
it
,
arm
it
,
feed
it
,
provide
it
with
all
necessary
and
contingency
,
and
I
will
pay
the
piper
!
 
<EOS>
do
your
duty
by
my
brave
troop
,
"
say
the
Prince
,
"
and
do
it

,
and
I
will
pour
my
treasure
out
like
water

to
defray
the
cost

<EOS>
who
ever
hear
me
complain
of
money
<EOS>
well
lay
out
!
"
 
<EOS>
which
indeed
he
have
reason
for
say
,
inasmuch
as
he
be
well
known
to
be
a
truly
generous
and
munificent
Prince
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
servant
hear
those
word
,
they
send
out
the
army
against
Prince
Bear
,
and
they
set
the
army
tailor
to
work
,
and
the
army
provision
merchant
,
and
the
maker
of
gun
both
great
and
small
,
and
the
gunpowder
maker
,
and
the
maker
of
ball
,
shell
,
and
shoot
;
and
they
buy
up
all
manner
of
store
and
ship
,
without
trouble
their
head
about
the
price
,
and
appear
to
be
so
busy
that
the
good
Prince
rub
his
hand
,
and
(
use
a
favourite
expression
of
his
)
,
say
,
"
It
be
all
right

I
"
but
,
while
they
be
thus
employ
,
the
Prince
's
godmother
,
who
be
a
great
favourite
with
those
servant
,
look
in
upon
them
continually
all

long
,
and
<EOS>
whenever
she
pop
in
her
head
at
the
door
say
,
how
do

<EOS>
"
Oho

"
say
this
wicked
Fairy

<EOS>

"
 
<EOS>
and
then
the
business
all
go
wrong
,
whatever
it
be
,
and
the
servant
'
head
become
so
addled
and
muddle
that
they
think
they
be
do
wonder
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
this
be
very
bad
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
vicious
old
nuisance
,
and
she
ought
to
have
be
strangle
,
even
if
she
have
stop
here
;
but
,
she
do
not
stop
here
,
as
you
shall
learn
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
a
number
of
the
Prince
's
subject
,
be
very
fond
of
the
Prince
's
army
who
be
the
brave
of
man
,
assemble
together
and
provide
all
manner
of
eatable
and
drinkable

and
book
to

,
and
clothe
to
wear
,
and
tobacco
to
smoke
,
and
candy
to
burn
,
and
nail
them
up
in
great
packing

case
,
and
put
them
aboard
a
great
many
ship
,
to
be
carry
out
to
that
brave
army
in
the
cold
and
inclement
country
where
they
be
fight
Prince
Bear
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
up
come
this
wicked
Fairy
as
the
ship
be
weigh
anchor
,
and
say
,
"
how
do
you
do

<EOS>
what

"
<EOS>
---
"
We
be
go
with
all

comfort
to

<EOS>
"
Oho

say
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
pleasant
voyage

"
 
<EOS>
and
from
that
time
forth
,
those
enchanting
ship
go
sailing
,
against
wind
and
tide
and
rhyme
and
reason
,
round
and
round
the
world
,
and
whenever
they
touch
at
any
port
be
order
off
immediately
,
and
could
never
deliver
their
cargo
anywhere
.
   
<EOS>
this
,
again
,
be
very
bad
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
vicious
old
nuisance
,
and
she
ought
to
have
be
strangle
for
it
if
she
have
do
nothing
bad
;
but
,
she
do
something
bad
still
,
as
you
shall
learn
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
she
get
astride
of
an
official
broomstick
,
and
mutter
as
a
spell
these
two
sentence
,
"
<EOS>
on
Her
Majesty
's
service
,
"
and
"
I
have
the
honour
to
be
,
sir
,
your
most
obedient
servant
,
"
and
presently
alight
in
the
cold
and
inclement
country
where
the
army
of
Prince
Bull
be
encamp
to
fight
the
army
of
Prince
Bear
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
sea
-
shore
of
that
country
,
she
find
pile
together
,
a
number
of
house
for
the
army
to
live
in
,
and
a
quantity
of
provision
for
the
army
to
live
upon
,
and
a
quantity
of
clothe
for
the
army
to
wear
:
while
,
sit
in
the
mud
gaze
at
them
,
be
a
group
of
officer
as
red
to
look
at
as
the
wicked
old
woman
herself
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
she
say
to
one
of
them
,
"
who
be
you
,
my
darling
,
and
how
do
you
do

"
I
be
the
Quartermaster
General
's
Department

godmother

and
I
be
pretty

"
 
<EOS>
then
she
say
to
another
,
"
who
be

,
my
darling
,
and
how
do
you
do
?
"
---
"
I
be
the
Commissariat
Department
,
godmother
,
and
I
be
pretty

<EOS>
then
she
say
to
another
,
"
who
be
you
,
my
darling
,
and
how
do
you
do
?
"
---
"
I
be
the
Head
of
the
Medical
Department
,
godmother
,
and
I
be
pretty
well
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
,
she
say
to
some
gentleman
scent
with
lavender
,
who
keep
themselves
at
a
great
distance
from
the
rest
,
"
<EOS>
and
who
be
you
,
my
pretty
pet
,
and
how
do
you
do
?
"
 
<EOS>
and
they
answer
,
"
We

"
---
"
I
be
delighted
to
see
you
all
,
my
beauty
,
"
say
this
wicked
old
Fairy
,
"
---
tape
!
"
 
<EOS>
upon
that
,
the
house
,
clothe
,
and
provision
,
all
moulder
away
;
and
the
soldier
who
be
sound
,
fall
sick
;
and
the
soldier
who
be
sick
,
die
miserably
:
and
the
noble
army
of
Prince
Bull
perish
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
dismal
news
of
his
great
loss
be
carry
to
the
Prince
,
he
suspect
his
godmother
very
much
indeed
;
but
,
he
know
that
his
servant
must
have
keep
company
with
the
malicious
beldame
,
and
must
have
give
way
to
her
,
and
therefore
he
resolve
to
turn
those
servant
out
of
their
place
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
he
call
to
him
a
Roebuck
who
have
the
gift
of
speech
,
and
he
say
,
"
Good
Roebuck
,
tell
them
they
must
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
,
the
good
Roebuck
deliver
his
message
,
so
like
a
man
that
you
may
have
suppose
him
to
be
nothing
but
a
man
,
and
they
be
turn
out
---
but
,
not
without
warn
,
for
that
they
have
have
a
long
time
.
   
<EOS>
and
now
come
the
most
extraordinary
part
of
the
history
of
this
Prince
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
turn
out
those
servant
,
of
course
he
want
other
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
his
astonishment
to
find
that
in
all
his
dominion
,
which
contain
no
less
than
twenty
-
seven
million
of
people
,
there
be
not
above
five
-
and
-
twenty
servant
altogether
!
<EOS>
They
be
so
lofty
about
it
,
too
,
that
instead
of
discuss
whether
they
should
hire
themselves
as
servant
to
Prince
Bull
,
they
turn
thing
topsy
-
turvy
,
and
consider
whether
as
a
favour
they
should
hire
Prince
Bull
to
be
their
master
!
 
<EOS>
while
they
be
argue
this
point
among
themselves
quite
at
their
leisure
,
the
wicked
old
red
Fairy
be
incessantly
go
up
and
down
,
knock
at
the
door
of
twelve
of
the
old
of
the
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
who
be
the
old
inhabitant
in
all
that
country
,
and
whose
united
age
amount
to
one
thousand
,
say
,
"
Will
you
hire
Prince
Bull
for
your
master
?
---
<EOS>
Will
you
hire
Prince
Bull
for
your
master
?
"
 
<EOS>
to
which
one
answer
,
"
I
will
if
next
door
will
;
"
and
another
,
"
I
will
not
if
over
the
way
do
;
"
and
another
,
"
I
can
not
if
he
,
she
,
or
they
,
may
,
could
,
would
,
or
should

"
 
<EOS>
and
all
this
time
Prince
Bull
's
affair
be
go
to
rack
and
ruin
.
   
<EOS>
at
last
,
Prince
Bull
in
the
height
of
his
perplexity
assume
a
thoughtful
face
,
as
if
he
be
strike
by
an
entirely
new
idea
.
 
<EOS>
the
wicked
old
Fairy
,
see
this
,
be
at
his
elbow
directly
,
and
say
,
"
how
do
you
do
,
my
Prince
,
and
what
be
you
think
of
?
"
<EOS>
---
"
I
be
think
,
godmother
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
among
all
the
seven
-
and
-
twenty
million
of
my
subject
who
have
never
be
in
service
,
there
be
man
of
intellect
and
business
who
have
make
me
very
famous
both
among
my
friend
and
enemy
.
<EOS>
"
---
"
aye
,
truly
?
"
say
the
Fairy
.
<EOS>
---
"
aye
,
truly
,
"
say
the
Prince
.
<EOS>
---
"
and
what
then
?
"
say
the
Fairy
.
<EOS>
---
"
why
,
then
,
"
say
he
,
"
since
the
regular
old
class
of
servant
do
so
ill
,
be
so
hard
to
get
,
and
carry
it
with
so
high
a
hand
,
perhaps
I
may
try
to
make
good
servant
of
some
of
these
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
word
have
no
sooner
pass
his
lip
than
she
return
,
chuckle
,
"
You
think
so
,
do
you
?
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
my
Prince
?
<EOS>
---
tape
!
"
 
<EOS>
thereupon
he
directly
forget
what
he
be
think
of
,
and
cry
out
lamentably
to
the
old
servant
,
"
o
,
do
come
and
hire
your
poor
old
master
!
<EOS>
Pray
do
!
 
<EOS>
on
any
term
!
"
   
<EOS>
and
this
,
for
the
present
,
finish
the
story
of
Prince
Bull
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
wind
it
up
by
say
that
he
live
happy
ever
afterwards
,
but
I
can
not
in
my
conscience
do
so
;
for
,
with
tape
at
his
elbow
,
and
his
estranged
child
fatally
repel
by
her
from
come
near
him
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
,
to
tell
you
the
plain
truth
,
believe
in
the
possibility
of
such
an
end
to
it
.
    
<EOS>
a
Plated
article
 
<EOS>
put
up
for
the
night
in
one
of
the
chief
town
of
Staffordshire
,
I
find
it
to
be
by
no
mean
a
lively
town
.
 
<EOS>
in
fact
,
it
be
as
dull
and
dead
a
town
as
any
one
could
desire
not
to
see
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
its
whole
population
may
be
imprison
in
its
Railway
Station
.
 
<EOS>
the
Refreshment
Room
at
that
Station
be
a
vortex
of
dissipation
compare
with
the
extinct
town
-
inn
,
the
Dodo
,
in
the
dull
High
Street
.
   
<EOS>
why
High
Street
?
 
<EOS>
why
not
rather
Low
Street
,
Flat
Street
,
low
-
Spirited
Street
,
use
-
up
Street
?
 
<EOS>
where
be
the
people
who
belong
to
the
High
Street
?
 
<EOS>
Can
they
all
be
disperse
over
the
face
of
the
country
,
seek
the
unfortunate
Strolling
Manager
who
decamp
from
the
mouldy
little
Theatre
last
week
,
in
the
beginning
of
his
season
(
as
his
play

bill
testify
)
,
repentantly
resolve
to
bring
him
back
,
and
feed
him
,
and
be
entertain
?
 
<EOS>
or
,
can
they
all
be
gather
to
their
father
in
the
two
old
churchyard
near
to
the
High
Street
---
retirement
into
which
churchyard
appear
to
be
a
mere
ceremony
<EOS>
,
there
be
so
very
little
life
outside
their
confine
,
and
such
small
discernible
difference
between
be
bury
alive
in
the
town
,
and
bury
dead
in
the
town
tomb
?
 
<EOS>
over
the
way
,
opposite
to
the
stare
blank
bow
window
of
the
Dodo

be
a
little
ironmonger

a
little

with
a

the
Fashions
in
the
small
window
and
a
bandy

legged
baby
on
the
pavement
stare
at
it
)
---
a
watchmaker
shop
,
where
all
the
clock
and
watch
must
be
stop
,
I
be
sure
,
for
they
could
never
have
the
courage
to
go

with
the
town
in

the
Dodo
in

look

<EOS>
Shade

thou

fitly

<EOS>
I
myself
be
one
of
the
last
visitor
to
that
awful
storehouse
of
thy
life
's
work
,
where
an
anchorite
old
man
and
woman
take
my
shilling
with
a
solemn
wonder
,
and
conduct
me
to
a
gloomy
sepulchre
of
needlework
drop
to
piece
with
dust
and
age
and
shroud
in
twilight
at
high
noon

leave
me
there

chill

alone

<EOS>
and
now
,
in
ghostly
letter
on
all
the
dead

of
this
dead

I
read
thy
honoured
name
,
and
find
that
thy
<EOS>
last
supper
,
work
in
Berlin
Wool
,
invite
inspection
as
a
powerful
excitement
!
   
<EOS>
where
be
the
people
who
be
bidden
with
so
much
cry
to
this
feast
of
little
wool
?
 
<EOS>
where
be
they
?
 
<EOS>
who
be
they
?
 
<EOS>
They
be
not
the
bandy
-
legged
baby
study
the
fashion
in
the
tailor
's
window
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
the
two
earthy
plowman
lounge
outside
the
saddler
's
shop
,
in
the
stiff
square
where
the
Town
Hall
stand
,
like
a
brick
and
mortar
private
on
parade
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
not
the
landlady
of
the
Dodo
in
the
empty
bar
,
whose
eye
have
trouble
in
it
and
no
welcome
,
when
I
ask
for
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
not
the
turnkey
of
the
Town
Jail
,
look
out
of
the
gateway
in
their
uniform
,
as
if
they
have
lock
up
all
the
balance
(
as
my
american
friend
would
say
)
of
the
inhabitant
,
and
could
now
rest
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
not
the
two
dusty
miller
in
the
white
mill
down
by
the
river
,
where
the
great
water

wheel
go
heavily
round
and
round
,
like
the
monotonous
day

night
in
this

place

<EOS>
then
who
be
they
,
for
there
be
no

<EOS>
no

this
deponent
maketh
oath
and
saith
that
there
be
no
one
else
,
save
and
except
the
waiter
at
the
Dodo
,
now
lay
the
cloth
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
pace
the
street
,
and
stare
at
the
house
,
and
be
come
back
to
the
blank
bow
window
of
the
Dodo
;
and
the
town
clock
strike
seven
,
and
the
reluctant
echo
seem
to
cry
,
"
do
not
wake
us
!
"
and
the
bandy
-
legged
baby
have
go
home
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
if
the
Dodo
be
only
a
gregarious
bird
---
if
he
have
only
some
confused
idea
of
make
a
comfortable
nest
---
I
could
hope
to
get
through
the
hour
between
this
and
bed
-
time
,
without
be
consume
by
devour
melancholy
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
Dodo
's
habit
be
all
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
It
provide
me
with
a
trackless
desert
of
sitting
-
room
,
with
a
chair
for
every
day
in
the
year
,
a
table
for
every
month
,
and
a
waste
of
sideboard
where
a
lonely
China
vase
pine
in
a
corner
for
its
mate
long
depart
,
and
will
never
make
a
match
with
the
candlestick
in
the
opposite
corner
if
it
live
till
Doomsday
.
 
<EOS>
the
Dodo
have
nothing
in
the
larder
.
 
<EOS>
even
now
,
I
behold
the
boot
return
with
my
sole
in
a
piece
of
paper
;
and
with
that
portion
of
my
dinner
,
the
boot
,
perceive
me
at
the
blank
bow
window
,
slap
his
leg
as
he
come
across
the
road
,
pretend
it
be
something
else
.
 
<EOS>
the
Dodo
exclude
the
outer
air
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
mount
up
to
my
bedroom
,
a
smell
of
closeness
and
flue
get
lazily
up
my
nose
like
sleepy
snuff
.
 
<EOS>
the
loose
little
bit
of
carpet
writhe
under
my
tread
,
and
take
wormy
shape
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
the
ridiculous
man
in
the
looking
-
glass
,
beyond
have
meet
him
once
or
twice
in
a
dish
-
cover
---
<EOS>
and
I
can
never
shave
him
to
-
morrow
morning
!
 
<EOS>
the
Dodo
be
narrow
-
minded
as
to
towel
;
expect
me
to
wash
on
a
freemason
's
apron
without
the
trimming
:
when
I
ask
for
soap
,
give
me
a
stony
-
hearte
something
white
,
with
no
more
lather
in
it
than
the
Elgin
marble
.
 
<EOS>
the
Dodo
have
see
well
day
,
and
possess
interminable
stable
at
the
back
---
silent
,
grass
-
grow
,
break
-
windowed
,
horseless
.
   
<EOS>
this
mournful
bird
can
fry
a
sole
,
however
,
which
be
much
.
 
<EOS>
Can
cook
a
steak
,
too
,
which
be
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
where
it
get
its
Sherry
?
 
<EOS>
if
I
be
to
send
my
pint
of
wine
to
some
famous
chemist
to
be
analyse
,
what
would
it
turn
out
to
be
make
of
?
 
<EOS>
It
taste
of
pepper
,
sugar
,
bitter
-
almond
,
vinegar
,
warm
knife
,
any
flat
drink
,
and
a
little
brandy
.
 
<EOS>
Would
it
unman
a
spanish
exile
by
remind
him
of
his
native
land
at
all
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
not
.
 
<EOS>
if
there
really
be
any
townspeople
out
of
the
churchyard
,
and
if
a
caravan
of
them
ever
do
dine
,
with
a
bottle
of
wine
per
man
,
in
this
desert
of
the
Dodo
,
it
must
make
good
for
the
doctor
next
day
!
   
<EOS>
where
be
the
waiter
bear
?
 
<EOS>
how
do
he
come
here
?
 
<EOS>
have
he
any
hope
of
get
away
from
here
?
 
<EOS>
do
he
ever
receive
a
letter
,
or
take
a
ride
upon
the
railway
,
or
see
anything
but
the
Dodo
?
 
<EOS>
perhaps
he
have
see
the
Berlin
Wool
.
 
<EOS>
He
appear
to
have
a
silent
sorrow
on
him
,
and
it
may
be
that
.
 
<EOS>
He
clear
the
table
;
draw
the
dingy
curtain
of
the
great
bow
window
,
which
so
unwillingly
consent
to
meet
,
that
they
must
be
pin
together
;
leave
me
by
the
fire
with
my
pint
decanter
,
and
a
little
thin
funnel
-
shape
wine
-
glass
,
and
a
plate
of
pale
biscuit
---
<EOS>
in
themselves
engender
desperation
.
   
<EOS>
no
book
,
no
newspaper
!
 
<EOS>
I
leave
the
Arabian
Nights
in
the
railway
carriage
,
and
have
nothing
to
read
but
Bradshaw
,
and
"
that
way
madness
lie
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
remember
what
prisoner
and
ship
-
wreck
mariner
have
do
to
exercise
their
mind
in
solitude
,
I
repeat
the
multiplication
table
,
the
pence
table
,
and
the
shill
table
:
which
be
all
the
table
I
happen
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
what
<EOS>
if
I
write
something
?
 
<EOS>
the
Dodo
keep
no
pen
but
steel
pen
;
and
those
I
always
stick
through
the
paper
,
and
can
turn
to
no
other
account
.
   
<EOS>
what
be
I
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
even
if
I
could
have
the
bandy
-
legged
baby
knock
up
and
bring
here
,
I
could
offer
him
nothing
but
sherry
,
and
that
would
be
the
death
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
never
hold
up
his
head
again
if
he
touch
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
go
to
bed
,
because
I
have
conceive
a
mortal
hatred
for
my
bedroom
;
and
I
can
not
go
away
,
because
there
be
no
train
for
my
place
of
destination
until
morning
.
 
<EOS>
to
burn
the
biscuit
will
be
but
a
fleeting
joy
;
still
it
be
a
temporary
relief
,
and
here
they
go
on
the
fire
!
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
break
the
plate
?
 
<EOS>
first
let
me
look
at
the
back
,
and
see
who
make
it
.
<EOS>
COPELAND
.
   
<EOS>
Copeland
!
 
<EOS>
stop
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
yesterday
I
visit
Copeland
's
work
,
and
see
them
make
plate
?
 
<EOS>
in
the
confusion
of
travel
about
,
it
may
be
yesterday
or
it
may
be
yesterday
month
;
but
I
think
it
be
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
I
appeal
to
the
plate
.
 
<EOS>
the
plate
say
,
decidedly
,
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
the
plate
,
as
I
look
at
it
,
grow
into
a
companion
.
   
<EOS>
do
not
you
remember
(
say
the
plate
)
<EOS>
how
you
steam
away
,
yesterday
morning
,
in
the
bright
sun
and
the
east
wind
,
along
the
valley
of
the
sparkling
Trent
?
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
recollect
how
many
kiln
you
fly
past
,
look
like
the
bowl
of
gigantic
tobacco
-
pipe
,
cut
short
off
from
the
stem
and
turn
upside
down
?
 
<EOS>
and
the
fire
---
and
the
smoke
---
and
the
road
make
with
bit
of
crockery
,
as
if
all
the
plate
and
dish
in
the
civilised
world
have
be
macadamise
,
expressly
for
the
laming
of
all
the
horse
?
 
<EOS>
of
course
I
do
!
   
<EOS>
and
do
not
you
remember
(
say
the
plate
)
how
you
alight
at
Stoke
---
a
picturesque
heap
of
house
,
kiln
,
smoke
,
wharf
,
canal
,
and
river
,
lie
(
as
be
most
appropriate
)
in
a
basin
---
and
how
,
after
climb
up
the
side
of
the
basin
to
look
at
the
prospect
,
you
trundle
down
again
at
a
walking
-
match
pace
,
and
straight
proceed
to
my
father
's
,
Copeland
's
,
where
the
whole
of
my
family
,
high
and
low
,
rich
and
poor
,
be
turn
out
upon
the
world
from
our
nursery
and
seminary
,
cover
some
fourteen
acre
of
ground
?
 
<EOS>
and
do
not
you
remember
what
we
spring
from
:
---
heap
of
lump
of
clay
,
partially
prepared
and
clean
in
Devonshire
and
Dorsetshire
<EOS>
,
whence
say
clay
principally
come
---
and
hill
of
flint
,
without
which
we
should
want
our
ring
sound
,
and
should
never
be
musical
?
 
<EOS>
and
as
to
the
flint
,
do
not
you
recollect
that
it
be
first
burn
in
kiln
,
and
be
then
lay
under
the
four
iron
foot
of
a
demon
slave
,
subject
to
violent
stamp
fit
,
who
,
when
they
come
on
,
stamp
away
insanely
with
his
four
iron
leg
,
and
would
crush
all
the
flint
in
the
Isle
of
Thanet
to
powder
,
without
leave
off
?
<EOS>
and
as
to
the
clay
,
do
not
you
recollect
how
it
be
put
into
mill
or
teazer
,
and
be
slice
,
and
dig
,
and
cut
at
,
by
endless
knife
,
clogged
and
sticky
,
but
persistent
---
and
be
press
out
of
that
machine
through
a
square
trough
,
whose
form
it
take
---
and
be
cut
off
in
square
lump
and
throw
into
a
vat
,
and
there
mix
with
water
,
and
beat
to
a
pulp
by
paddle
-
wheel
---
and
be
then
run
into
a
rough
house
,
all
rugged
beam
and
ladder
splash
with
white
,
---
superintend
by
Grindoff
the
Miller
in
his
work
clothe
,
all
splash
with
white
,
---
where
it
pass
through
no
end
of
machinery
-
move
sieve
all
splash
with
white
,
arrange
in
an
ascend
scale
of
fineness
(
some
so
fine
,
that
three
hundred
silk
thread
cross
each
other
in
a
single
square
inch
of
their
surface
)
,
and
all
in
a
violent
state
of
ague
with
their
tooth
for
ever
chatter
,
and
their
body
for
ever
shiver
!
 
<EOS>
and
as
to
the
flint
again
,
be
not
it
mash
and
mollified
and
trouble
and
soothe
,
exactly
as
rag
be
in
a
paper
-
mill
,
until
it
be
reduce
to
a
pap
so
fine
that
it
contain
no
atom
of
"
grit
"
perceptible
to
the
nice
taste
?
 
<EOS>
and
as
to
the
flint
and
the
clay
together
,
be
they
not
,
after
all
this
,
mix
in
the
proportion
of
five
of
clay
to
one
of
flint
,
and
be
not
the
compound
---
know
as
"
slip
"
---
run
into
oblong
trough
,
where
its
superfluous
moisture
may
evaporate
;
and
finally
,
be
not
it
slap
and
bang
and
beat
and
pat
and
knead
and
wedge
and
knock
about
like
butter
,
until
it
become
a
beautiful
grey
dough
,
ready
for
the
potter
's
use
?
   
<EOS>
in
regard
of
the
potter
,
popularly
so
call
(
say
the
plate
)
,
you
do
not
mean
to
say
you
have
forget
that
a
workman
call
a
Thrower
be
the
man
under
whose
hand
this
grey
dough
take
the
shape
of
the
simple
household
vessel
as
quickly
as
the
eye
can
follow
?
 
<EOS>
You
do
not
mean
to
say
you
can
not
call
him
up
before
you
,
sit
,
with
his
attendant
woman
,
at
his
potter
's
wheel
---
<EOS>
a
disc
about
the
size
of
a
dinner
-
plate
,
revolve
on
two
drum
slowly
or
quickly
as
he
will
---
who
make
you
a
complete
breakfast
-
set
for
a
bachelor
,
as
a
good
-
humoured
little
off
-
hand
joke
?
 
<EOS>
You
remember
how
he
take
up
as
much
dough
as
he
want
,
and
,
throw
it
on
his
wheel
,
in
a
moment
fashion
it
into
a
teacup
---
catch
up
more
clay
and
make
a
saucer
---
a
large
dab
and
whirl
it
into
a
teapot
---
wink
at
a
small
dab
and
convert
it
into
the
lid
of
the
teapot
,
accurately
fitting
by
the
measurement
of
his
eye
alone
---
coax
a
middle
-
sized
dab
for
two
second
,
break
it
,
turn
it
over
at
the
rim
,
and
make
a
milkpot
---
laugh
,
and
turn
out
a
slop
-
basin
---
cough
,
and
provide
for
the
sugar
?
 
<EOS>
neither
,
I
think
,
be
you
oblivious
of
the
new
mode
of
make
various
article
,
but
especially
basin
,
accord
to
which
improvement
a
mould
revolve
instead
of
a
disc
?
 
<EOS>
for
you
MUST
remember
(
say
the
plate
)
<EOS>
how
you
see
the
mould
of
a
little
basin
spinning
round
and
round
,
and
how
the
workman
smooth
and
press
a
handful
of
dough
upon
it
,
and
how
with
an
instrument
call
a
profile
(
a
piece
of
wood
,
represent
the
profile
of
a
basin
's
foot
)
<EOS>
he
cleverly
scrape
and
carve
the
ring
which
make
the
base
of
any
such
basin
,
and
then
take
the
basin
off
the
lathe
like
a
doughy
skull
-
cap
to
be
dry
,
and
afterwards
(
in
what
be
call
a
green
state
)
to
be
put
into
a
second
lathe
,
there
to
be
finish
and
burnish
with
a
steel
burnisher
?
 
<EOS>
and
as
to
mould
in
general
(
say
the
plate
)
,
it
can
not
be
necessary
for
me
to
remind
you
that
all
ornamental
article
,
and
indeed
all
article
not
quite
circular
,
be
make
in
mould
.
 
<EOS>
for
you
must
remember
how
you
see
the
vegetable
dish
,
for
example
,
be
make
in
mould
;
and
how
the
handle
of
teacup
,
and
the
spout
of
teapot
,
and
the
foot
of
tureen
,
and
so
forth
,
be
all
make
in
little
separate
mould
,
and
be
each
stuck
on
to
the
body
corporate
,
of
which
it
be
destine
to
form
a
part
,
with
a
stuff
call
"
slag
,
"
as
quickly
as
you
can
recollect
it
.
 
<EOS>
further
,
you
learn
---
<EOS>
you
know
you
do
---
in
the
same
visit
,
how
the
beautiful
sculpture
in
the
delicate
new
material
call
Parian
,
be
all
construct
in
mould
;
how
,
into
that
material
,
animal
bone
be
grind
up
,
because
the
phosphate
of
lime
contain
in
bone
make
it
translucent

how
everything

before
go
into
the
fire

one

fourth
large
than
it
be
intend
to
come
out
of
the
fire
,
because
it
shrink
in
that
proportion
in
the
intense
heat
;
how
,
when
a
figure
shrink
unequally
,
it
be
spoil
---
emerge
from
the
furnace
a
misshapen
birth
;
a
big
head
and
a
little
body
,
or
a
little
head
and
a
big
body
,
or
a
Quasimodo
with
long
arm
and
short
leg
,
or
a
Miss
Biffin
with
neither
leg
nor
arm
worth
mention
.
   
<EOS>
and
as
to
the
Kilns
,
in
which
the
firing
take
place
,
and
in
which
some
of
the
more
precious
article
be
burn
repeatedly
,
in
various
stage
of
their
process
towards
completion
,
---
as
to
the
Kilns
(
say
the
plate
,
warm
with
the
recollection
)
,
if
you
do
not
remember
them
with
a
horrible
interest
,
what
do
you
ever
go
to
Copeland
's
for
?
 
<EOS>
when
you
stand
inside
of
one
of
those
invert
bowl
of
a
Pre

adamite
tobacco

pipe
,
look
up
at
the
blue

through
the
open

far
off

you

have
look
up
from
a

the
Pantheon
at
Rome

have
you
the

idea
where
you
be

<EOS>
and
when
you
find
yourself
surround

in
that

cavern

by
innumerable
column
of
an
unearthly
order
of
architecture

support
nothing

Adamite
Samson
have
take
a

crush
it

<EOS>
no

the

see

yes

I

I

,

heat

I

I

that

be
pretty
strong
upon

when

go
out

God
for

<EOS>
after
that

I
need
not
remind
you
what
a
relief
it
be
to
see
the
simple
process
of
ornament
this

as
it
be
call
when

brown

convert
it

<EOS>
for
(

<EOS>
I
be
well
persuade
that
you
bear
in

<EOS>
how
those
particular
jug
and
mug
be
once
more
set
upon
a
lathe
and
put
in
motion
;
and
how
a
man
blow
the
brown
colour
(
have
a
strong
natural
affinity
with
the
material
in
that
condition
)
on
them
from
a
blowpipe
as
they
twirl
;
and
how
his
daughter
,
with
a
common
brush
,
drop
blotch
of
blue
upon
them
in
the
right
place
;
and
how
,
tilt
the
blotch
upside
down
,
she
make
them
run
into
rude
image
of
tree
,
and
there
an
end
.
   
<EOS>
and
do
not
you
see
(
say
the
plate
)
plant
upon
my
own
brother
that
astounding
blue
willow
,
with
knobbed
and
gnarled
trunk
,
and
foliage
of
blue
ostrich
feather
,
which
give
our
family
the
title
of
"
willow

<EOS>
and
do
not
you
observe
,
transfer
upon
him
at
the

,
<EOS>
that
blue
bridge
which
span
nothing
,
grow
out
from
the
root
of
the
willow
;
and
the
three
blue
Chinese
go
over
it
into
a
blue
temple

which
have
a
fine
crop
of

out

<EOS>
do
not
you
inspect
the
copper

plate
on
which
my

be
deeply
engrave

<EOS>
do
not
you
perceive
an
impression
of
it
take
in
cobalt
colour
at
a
cylindrical
press

upon
a
leaf
of
thin

,
stream
from
a

<EOS>
be

the

impression
daintily
spread

by
a
light

finger
damsel
(
you
know
you
admire
her

)
,
over
the
surface
of
the

and
the

of
the

rub
prodigiously
hard

with
a
long
tight

tie
up
like
a

without
so

ruffle
the

<EOS>
then
(

the

,
be
not
the

wash
away
with
a

and
do
not
there
appear

set
off
upon

,
<EOS>
this
identical
piece
of
Pre

raphaelite
blue
distemper
which
you
now
behold
?
 
<EOS>
not

<EOS>
I
have
see
all
this

more

<EOS>
I
have
be
show
,
at
Copeland

pattern
of
beautiful
design
,
in
faultless
perspective
,
which
be
cause
the
ugly
old
willow
to
wither
out
of
public
favour
;
and
which
,
be
quite
as
cheap
,
insinuate
good
wholesome
natural
art
into
the
humble
household
.
 
<EOS>
when
Mr

Mrs

have
satisfy
their
material
taste
by
that
equal
division
of
fat

lean
which
have

their

immortal

and
have
,
after
the

,
"

they
can

thank
to
modern

<EOS>
feast
their

taste
upon
excellent
delineation
of
natural
object
.
   
<EOS>
this
reflection
prompt
me
to
transfer
my
attention
from
the
blue
plate
to
the
forlorn
but
cheerfully
paint
vase
on
the
sideboard
.
<EOS>
and
surely
(
say
the
plate
)
<EOS>
you
have
not
forget
how
the
outline
of
such
group
of
flower
as
you
see
there
,
be
print
,
just
as
I
be
print
,
and
be
afterwards
shade
and
fill
in
with
metallic
colour
by
woman
and
girl
?
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
aristocracy
of
our
order
,
make
of
the
fine
clay
-
porcelain
peer
and
peeress
;
---
the
slab
,
and
panel
,
and
table
-
top
,
and
tazze
;
the
endless
nobility
and
gentry
of
dessert
,
breakfast
,
and
tea
service
;
the
gem
perfume
bottle
,
and
scarlet

gold
salver
;
you
see
that
they
be
paint
by
artist
,
with
metallic
colour
lay
on
with
camel

hair
pencil
,
and
afterwards
burn
in

<EOS>
and
talk
of
burn
in
(
say
the
plate
)
,
do
not
you
find
that
every
subject
,
from
the
willow
pattern
to
the
landscape
after
Turner
---
have
be
frame
upon
clay
or
porcelain
biscuit
---
have
to
be
glaze
?
 
<EOS>
of
course
,
you
see
the
glaze
---
compose
of
various
vitreous
material
---
lay
over
every
article
;
and
of
course
you
witness
the
close
imprisonment
of
each
piece
in
sagger
upon
the
separate
system
rigidly
enforce
by
mean
of
fine

point
earthenware
stilt
place
between
the
article
to
prevent
the
slight
communication

contact
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
in
my
time
---
<EOS>
and
I
suppose
it
be
the
same
now
---
fourteen
hour
'
firing
to
fix
the
glaze
and
to
make
it
"
run
"
all
over
us
equally
,
so
as
to
put
a
good
shiny
and
unscratchable
surface
upon
us

<EOS>
Doubtless
,
you
observe
that
one
sort
of
glaze

call
printing

body
---
be
burn
into
the
well
sort
of
ware
before
it
be

<EOS>
upon
this
you
see
some
of
the
fine
steel
engraving
transfer
,
to
be
fix
by
an

glazing
---
do
not
you
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
of
course
you
do
!
   
<EOS>
of
course
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
and
enjoy
everything
that
the

recall

me

and
have
behold
with
admiration
how
the
rotatory
motion
which
keep
this

its
place
in
the
great

with
all
its

be
necessary
throughout
the
process
,
and
could
only
be
dispense
with
in

<EOS>
so
,
listen
to
the
plate

reminder
,
and
muse
upon
them
,
I
get
through
the
evening
after
all
,
and
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
<EOS>
but
one
sleep
of
it

for
which
I
have
no

I
be
also
indebted
to
the

leave
the
lonely

quite

Our

We

<EOS>
Our

triumphantly
return

<EOS>
He
be
the
honourable
member
for
Verbosity
---
the
best
represent
place
in
England
.
   
<EOS>
Our
honourable
friend
have
issue
an
address
of
congratulation
to
the
Electors
,
which
be
worthy
of
that
noble
constituency
,
and
be
a
very
pretty
piece
of
composition
.
 
<EOS>
in
elect
him
,
he
say
,
they
have
cover
themselves
with
glory
,
and
England
have
be
true
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
(
in
his
preliminary
address
he
have
remark
,
in
a
poetical
quotation
of
great
rarity
,
that
nought
could
make
us
rue
,
if
England
to
herself
do
prove
but
true
.
)
   
<EOS>
Our
honourable
friend
deliver
a
prediction
,
in
the
same
document
,
that
the
feeble
minion
of
a
faction
will
never
hold
up
their
head
any
more
;
and
that
the
finger
of
scorn
will
point
at
them
in
their
dejected
state
,
through
countless
age
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
further
,
that
the
hireling
tool
that
would
destroy
the
sacred
bulwark
of
our
nationality
be
unworthy
of
the
name
of
Englishman
;
and
that
so
long
as
the
sea
shall
roll
around
our
ocean
-
gird
isle
,
so
long
his
motto
shall
be
,
no
surrender
.
 
<EOS>
certain
dogged
person
of
low
principle
and
no
intellect
,
have
dispute
whether
anybody
know
who
the
minion
be
,
or
what
the
faction
be
,
or
which
be
the
hireling
tool
and
which
the
sacred
bulwark
,
or
what
it
be
that
be
never
to
be
surrender
,
and
if
not
,
why
not
?
 
<EOS>
but
,
our
honourable
friend
the
member
for
verbosity
know
all
about
it
.
   
<EOS>
Our
honourable
friend
have
sit
in
several
parliament
,
and
give
bushel
of
vote
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
of
that
profundity
in
the
matter
of
vote
-
giving
,
that
you
never
know
what
he
mean
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
seem
to
be
vote
pure
white
,
he
may
be
in
reality
voting
jet
black
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
say
yes
,
it
be
just
as
likely
as
not
---
or
rather
more
so
---
that
he
mean
no
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
statesmanship
of
our
honourable
friend
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
this
,
that
he
differ
from
mere
unparliamentary
man
.
 
<EOS>
you
may
not
know
what
he
mean
then

or
what
he

now

but
,
our

know
,
and
do
from
the
first
know

both
what

then

and
what

when

say
he
do
not

it
then
,
he
do
in
fact
say
,
that
he
mean
it
now

<EOS>
and
if
you
mean
to
say
that
you
do
not

and
do
not

know
what
he
do
mean

mean
now

our

will
be
glad
to
receive
an
explicit
declaration
from
you
whether
you
be
prepared
to
destroy
the
sacred
bulwark
of
our
nationality
.
   
<EOS>
Our
honourable
friend
,
the
member
for
Verbosity
,
have
this
great
attribute
,
that
he
always
mean
something
,
and
always
mean
the
same
thing
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
come
down
to
that
House
and
mournfully
boast
in
his
place
,
as
an
individual
member
of
the
assemble
Commons
of
this
great
and
happy
country
,
that
he
could
lay
his
hand
upon
his
heart
,
and
solemnly
declare
that
no
consideration
on
earth
should
induce
him
,
at
any
time
or
under
any
circumstance
,
to
go
as
far
north
as
Berwick

upon

Tweed

and
when
he
nevertheless
,
next
year
,
do
go
to
Berwick

and
even
beyond
it

to
Edinburgh

he
have
one
single
meaning

one
and
indivisible

<EOS>
and
God
forbid
(
our
honourable

say
)
that
he
should
waste
another
argument
upon
the
man
who
profess
that
he

<EOS>
"
I

say
our

with
indignant
emphasis

amid
great
cheering

on
one
such
public
occasion

<EOS>
"
I
do

I
be
free
to
confess

envy
the
feeling
of
that
man

so
constituted

that
he
can
hold
such
language
to

(
Vehement

<EOS>
when
our
honourable
friend
issue
his
preliminary
address
to
the
constituent
body
of
Verbosity
on
the
occasion
of
one
particular
glorious
triumph
,
it
be
suppose
by
some
of
his
enemy
,
that
even
he
would
be
place
in
a
situation
of
difficulty
by
the
follow
comparatively
trifle
conjunction
of
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
the
dozen
nobleman
and
gentleman
whom
our
honourable
friend
support
,
have
"
come
in
,
"
expressly
to
do
a
certain
thing
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
four
of
the
dozen
say
,
at
a
certain
place
,
that
they
do
not
mean
to
do
that
thing
,
and
have
never
mean
to
do
it
;
another
four
of
the
dozen
say
,
at
another
certain
place
,
that
they
do
mean
to
do
that
thing
,
and
have
always
mean
to
do
it
;
two
of
the
remain
four
say
,
at
two
other
certain
place
,
that
they
mean
to
do
half
of
that
thing
(
but
differ
about
which
half
)
,
and
to
do
a
variety
of
nameless
wonder
instead
of
the
other
half
;
and
one
of
the
remain
two
declare
that
the
thing
itself
be
dead
and
bury
,
while
the
other
as
strenuously
protest
that
it
be
alive
and
kicking
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
admit
that
the
parliamentary
genius
of
our
honourable
friend
would
be
quite
able
to
reconcile
such
small
discrepancy
as
these
;
but
,
there
remain
the
additional
difficulty
that
each
of
the
twelve
make
entirely
different
statement
at
different
place
,
and
that
all
the
twelve
call
everything
visible
and
invisible
,
sacred
and
profane
,
to
witness
,
that
they
be
a
perfectly
impregnable
phalanx
of
unanimity
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
it
be
apprehend
,
would
be
a
stumbling
-
block
to
our
honourable
friend
.
   
<EOS>
the
difficulty
come
before
our
honourable
friend
,
in
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
down
to
verbosity
to
meet
his
free
and
independent
constituent
,
and
to
render
an
account
(
as
he
inform
them
in
the
local
paper
)
of
the
trust
they
have
confide
to
his
hand
---
that
trust
which
it
be
one
of
the
proud
privilege
of
an
Englishman
to
possess
---
that
trust
<EOS>
which
it
be
the
proud
privilege
of
an
Englishman
to
hold
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
mention
as
a
proof
of
the
great
general
interest
attach
to
the
contest
,
that
a
Lunatic
whom
nobody
employ
or
know
,
go
down
to
verbosity
with
several
thousand
pound
in
gold
,
determine
to
give
the
whole
away
---
which
he
actually
do
;
and
that
all
the
publican
open
their
house
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
likewise
,
several
fight
man
,
and
a
patriotic
group
of
burglar
sportively
armed
with
life
-
preserver
,
proceed
(
in
barouche
and
very
drunk
)
to
the
scene
of
action
at
their
own
expense
;
these
child
of
nature
have
conceive
a
warm
attachment
to
our
honourable
friend
,
and
intending
,
in
their
artless
manner
,
to
testify
it
by
knock
the
voter
in
the
opposite
interest
on
the
head
.
   
<EOS>
Our
honourable
friend
be
come
into
the
presence
of
his
constituent
,
and
have
profess
with
great
suavity
that
he
be
delighted
to
see
his
good
friend
Tipkisson
there
,
in
his
working

dress
---
his
good
friend
Tipkisson
be
an
inveterate
saddler
,
who
always
oppose
him
,
and
for
whom
he
have
a
mortal
hatred
---
make
them
a
brisk
,
ginger
-
beery
sort
of
speech
,
in
which
he
show
them
<EOS>
how
the
dozen
nobleman
and
gentleman
have
(
in
exactly
ten
day
from
their
come
in
)
exercise
a
surprisingly
beneficial
effect
on
the
whole
financial
condition
of
Europe
,
have
alter
the
state
of
the
export
and
import
for
the
current
half
-
year
,
have
prevent
the
drain
of
gold
,
have
make
all
that
matter
right
about
the
glut
of
the
raw
material
,
and
have
restore
all
sort
of
balance
with
which
the
superseded
nobleman
and
gentleman
have
play
the
deuce
---
and
all
this
,
with
wheat
at
so
much
a
quarter
,
gold
at
so
much
an
ounce
,
and
the
Bank
of
England
discount
good
bill
at
so
much
per

<EOS>
He
may
be
ask
,
he
observe
in
a
peroration
of
great
power
,
what
be
his
principle
?
 
<EOS>
His
principle
be
what
they
always
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
His
principle
be
write
in
the
countenance
of
the
lion
and
unicorn
;
be
stamp
indelibly
upon
the
royal
shield
which
those
grand
animal
support
,
and
upon
the
free
word
of
fire
which
that
shield
bore
.
 
<EOS>
His
principle
be
,
Britannia
and
her
sea
-
king
trident
!
 
<EOS>
His
principle
be
,
commercial
prosperity
co
-
existently
with
perfect
and
profound
agricultural
contentment
;
but
short
of
this
he
would
never
stop
.
 
<EOS>
His
principle
be
,
these
,
---
with
the
addition
of
his
colour
nail
to
the
mast
,
every
man
's
heart
in
the
right
place
,
every
man
's
eye
open
,
every
man
's
hand
ready
,
every
man
's
mind
on
the
alert
.
 
<EOS>
His
principle
be
these
,
concurrently
with
a
general
revision
of
something
---
speak
generally
---
and
a
possible
readjustment
of
something
else
,
not
to
be
mention
more
particularly
.
 
<EOS>
His
principle
,
to
sum
up
all
in
a
word
,
be
,
Hearths
and
Altars
,
Labour
and
Capital
,
Crown
and
Sceptre
,
Elephant
and
Castle
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
,
if
his
good
friend
Tipkisson
require
any
further
explanation
from
him
,
he
(
our
honourable
friend
)
be
there
,
willing
and
ready
to
give
it
.
   
<EOS>
Tipkisson
,
who
all
this
time
have
stand
conspicuous
in
the
crowd
,
with
his
arm
fold
and
his
eye
intently
fasten
on
our
honourable
friend
:
<EOS>
Tipkisson
,
who
throughout
our
honourable
friend
's
address
have
not
relax
a
muscle
of
his
visage
,
but
have
stand
there
,
wholly
unaffected
by
the
torrent
of
eloquence
:
an
object
of
contempt
and
scorn
to
mankind
(
by
which
we
mean
,
of
course
,
to
the
supporter
of
our
honourable
friend
)
;
Tipkisson
now
say
that
he
be
a
plain
man
(
cry
of
"
You
be
indeed
!
"
)
,
and
that
what
he
want
to
know
be
,
what
our
honourable
friend
and
the
dozen
nobleman
and
gentleman
be
drive
at
?
   
<EOS>
Our
honourable
friend
immediately
reply
,
"
at
the
illimitable
perspective
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
consider
by
the
whole
assembly
that
this
happy
statement
of
our
honourable
friend
's
political
view
ought
,
immediately
,
to
have
settle
Tipkisson
's
business
and
cover
him
with
confusion
;
but
,
that
implacable
person
,
regardless
of
the
execration
that
be
heap
upon
him
from
all
side
(
by
which
we
mean
,
of
course
,
from
our
honourable
friend
's
side
)
,
persist
in
retain
an
unmoved
countenance
,
and
obstinately
retort
that
if
our
honourable
friend
mean
that
,
he
wish
to
know
what
that
mean
?
   
<EOS>
It
be
in
repel
this
most
objectionable
and
indecent
opposition
,
that
our
honourable
friend
display
his
high
qualification
for
the
representation
of
Verbosity
.
 
<EOS>
His
warm
supporter
present
,
and
those
who
be
best
acquaint
with
his
generalship
,
suppose
that
the
moment
be
come
when
he
would
fall
back
upon
the
sacred
bulwark
of
our
nationality
.
 
<EOS>
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
He
reply
thus
:
"
My
good
friend
Tipkisson
,
gentleman
,
wish
to
know
what
I
mean
when
he
ask
me
what
we
be
drive
at
,
and
when
I
candidly
tell
him
,
at
the
illimitable
perspective
,
he
wish
(
if
I
understand
him
)
to
know
what
I
mean
?
"
<EOS>
---
"
I
do
!
"
<EOS>
say
Tipkisson
,
amid
cry
of
"
Shame
"
and
"
down
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
"
say
our
honourable
friend
,
"
I
will
indulge
my
good
friend
Tipkisson
,
by
tell
him
,
both
what
I
mean
and
what
I
do
not
mean
.
 
<EOS>
(
cheer
and
cry
of
"
give
it
him
!
"
)
 
<EOS>
be
it
known
to
him
then
,
and
to
all
whom
it
may
concern
,
that
I
do
mean
altar
,
hearth
,
and
home
,
and
that
I
do
not
mean
mosque
and
Mohammedanism
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
effect
of
this
home
-
thrust
be
terrific
.
 
<EOS>
Tipkisson
(
who
be
a
Baptist
)
be
hoot
down
and
hustle
out
,
and
have
ever
since
be
regard
as
a
turkish
Renegade
who
contemplate
an
early
pilgrimage
to
Mecca
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
he
the
only
discomfited
man
.
 
<EOS>
the
charge
,
while
it
stick
to
him
,
be
magically
transfer
to
our
honourable
friend
's
opponent
,
who
be
represent
in
an
immense
variety
of
placard
as
a
firm
believer
in
Mahomet
;
and
the
man
of
Verbosity
be
ask
to
choose
between
our
honourable
friend
and
the
Bible
,
and
our
honourable
friend
's
opponent
and
the
Koran
.
 
<EOS>
They
decide
for
our
honourable
friend
,
and
rally
round
the
illimitable
perspective
.
   
<EOS>
It
have
be
claim
for
our
honourable
friend
,
with
much
appearance
of
reason
,
that
he
be
the
first
to
bend
sacred
matter
to
electioneer
tactic
.
 
<EOS>
however
this
may
be
,
the
fine
precedent
be
undoubtedly
set
in
a
Verbosity
election
:
and
it
be
certain
that
our
honourable
friend
(
who
be
a
disciple
of
Brahma
in
his
youth
,
and
be
a
Buddhist
when
we
have
the
honour
of
travel
with
him
a
few
year
ago
)
always
profess
in
public
more
anxiety
than
the
whole
Bench
of
Bishops
,
regard
the
theological
and
doxological
opinion
of
every
man
,
woman
,
and
child
,
in
the
United
Kingdom
.
   
<EOS>
as
we
begin
by
say
that
our
honourable
friend
have
get
in
again
at
this
last
election
,
and
that
we
be
delighted
to
find
that
he
have
get
in
,
so
we
will
conclude
.
 
<EOS>
Our
honourable
friend
can
not
come
in
for
verbosity
too
often
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
good
sign
;
it
be
a
great
example
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
to
man
like
our
honourable
friend
,
and
to
contest
like
those
from
which
he
come
triumphant
,
that
we
be
mainly
indebted
for
that
ready
interest
in
politic
,
that
fresh
enthusiasm
in
the
discharge
of
the
duty
of
citizenship
,
that
ardent
desire
to
rush
to
the
poll
,
at
present
so
manifest
throughout
England
.
<EOS>
when
the
contest
lie
(
as
it
sometimes
do
)
between
two
such
man
as
our
honourable
friend
,
it
stimulate
the
fine
emotion
of
our
nature
,
and
awaken
the
high
admiration
of
which
our
head
and
heart
be
capable
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
too
much
to
predict
that
our
honourable
friend
will
be
always
at
his
post
in
the
ensue
session
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
the
question
be
,
or
whatever
the
form
of
its
discussion
;
address
to
the
crown
,
election
petition
,
expenditure
of
the
public
money
,
extension
of
the
public
suffrage
,
education
,
crime
;
in
the
whole
house
,
in
committee
of
the
whole
house
,
in
select
committee
;
in
every
parliamentary
discussion
of
every
subject
,
everywhere
:
the
Honourable
Member
for
Verbosity
will
most
certainly
be
find
.
    
<EOS>
Our
School
 
<EOS>
We
go
to
look
at
it
,
only
this
last
Midsummer
,
and
find
that
the
Railway
have
cut
it
up
root
and
branch
.
 
<EOS>
a
great
trunk
-
line
have
swallow
the
playground
,
slice
away
the
schoolroom
,
and
pare
off
the
corner
of
the
house
:
which
,
thus
curtail
of
its
proportion
,
present
itself
,
in
a
green
stage
of
stucco
,
profilewise
towards
the
road
,
like
a
forlorn
flat
-
iron
without
a
handle
,
stand
on
end
.
   
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
our
school
be
doom
to
be
the
sport
of
change
.
<EOS>
We
have
faint
recollection
of
a
Preparatory
Day
-
School
,
which
we
have
seek
in
vain
,
and
which
must
have
be
pull
down
to
make
a
new
street
,
age
ago
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
dim
impression
,
scarcely
amount
to
a
belief
,
that
it
be
over
a
dyer
's
shop
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
that
you
go
up
step
to
it
;
that
you
frequently
graze
your
knee
in
do
so
;
that
you
generally
get
your
leg
over
the
scraper
,
in
try
to
scrape
the
mud
off
a
very
unsteady
little
shoe
.
 
<EOS>
the
mistress
of
the
Establishment
hold
no
place
in
our
memory
;
but
,
rampant
on
one
eternal
door
-
mat
,
in
an
eternal
entry
long
and
narrow
,
be
a
puffy
pug
-
dog
,
with
a
personal
animosity
towards
us
,
who
triumph
over
Time
.
 
<EOS>
the
bark
of
that
baleful
Pug
,
a
certain
radiate
way
he
have
of
snapping
at
our
undefended
leg
,
the
ghastly
grin
of
his
moist
black
muzzle
and
white
tooth
,
and
the
insolence
of
his
crisp
tail
curl
like
a
pastoral
crook
,
all
live
and
flourish
.
 
<EOS>
from
an
otherwise
unaccountable
association
of
him
with
a
fiddle
,
we
conclude
that
he
be
of
french
extraction
,
and
his
name
FIDELE
.
 
<EOS>
He
belong
to
some
female
,
chiefly
inhabit
a
back
-
parlour
,
whose
life
appear
to
us
to
have
be
consume
in
sniff
,
and
in
wear
a
brown
beaver
bonnet
.
 
<EOS>
for
her
,
he
would
sit
up
and
balance
cake
upon
his
nose
,
and
not
eat
it
until
twenty
have
be
count
.
 
<EOS>
to
the
good
of
our
belief
we
be
once
call
in
to
witness
this
performance
;
when
,
unable
,
even
in
his
milder
moment
,
to
endure
our
presence
,
he
instantly
make
at
us
,
cake
and
all
.
   
<EOS>
why
a
something
in
mourning
,
call
"
Miss
Frost
,
"
should
still
connect
itself
with
our
preparatory
school
,
we
be
unable
to
say
.
<EOS>
We
retain
no
impression
of
the
beauty
of
Miss
Frost
---
if
she
be
beautiful
;
or
of
the
mental
fascination
of
Miss
Frost
---
if
she
be
accomplish
;
yet
her
name
and
her
black
dress
hold
an
endure
place
in
our
remembrance
.
 
<EOS>
an
equally
impersonal
boy
,
whose
name
have
long
since
shape
itself
unalterably
into
"
Master
Mawls
,
"
be
not
to
be
dislodge
from
our
brain
.
 
<EOS>
retain
no
vindictive
feeling
towards
Mawls
---
<EOS>
no
feeling
whatever
,
indeed
---
we
infer
that
neither
he
nor
we
can
have
love
Miss
Frost
.
 
<EOS>
Our
first
impression
of
Death
and
Burial
be
associate
with
this
formless
pair
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
three
nestled
awfully
in
a
corner
one
wintry
day
,
when
the
wind
be
blow
shrill
,
with
Miss
Frost
's
pinafore
over
our
head
;
and
Miss
Frost
tell
us
in
a
whisper
about
somebody
be
"
screw
down
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
only
distinct
recollection
we
preserve
of
these
impalpable
creature
,
except
a
suspicion
that
the
manner
of
Master
Mawls
be
susceptible
of
much
improvement
.
 
<EOS>
generally
speak
,
we
may
observe
that
whenever
we
see
a
child
intently
occupy
with
its
nose
,
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
subject
of
interest
,
our
mind
revert
,
in
a
flash
,
to
Master
Mawls
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
the
school
that
be
Our
School
before
the
railroad
come
and
overthrow
it
,
be
quite
another
sort
of
place
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
old
enough
to
be
put
into
Virgil
when
we
go
there
,
and
to
get
Prizes
for
a
variety
of
polish
on
which
the
rust
have
long
accumulate
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
School
of
some
celebrity
in
its
neighbourhood
---
nobody
could
have
say
why
---
and
we
have
the
honour
to
attain
and
hold
the
eminent
position
of
first
boy
.
 
<EOS>
the
master
be
suppose
among
us
to
know
nothing
,
and
one
of
the
usher
be
suppose
to
know
everything
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
still
inclined
to
think
the
first
-
name
supposition
perfectly
correct
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
a
general
idea
that
its
subject
have
be
in
the
leather
trade
,
and
have
buy
us
---
mean
Our
School
---
of
another
proprietor
who
be
immensely
learn
.
 
<EOS>
whether
this
belief
have
any
real
foundation
,
we
be
not
likely
ever
to
know
now
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
branch
of
education
with
which
he
show
the
least
acquaintance
,
be
,
rule
and
corporally
punish
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
always
rule
cipher
-
book
with
a
bloated
mahogany
ruler
,
or
smite
the
palm
of
offender
with
the
same
diabolical
instrument
,
or
viciously
draw
a
pair
of
pantaloon
tight
with
one
of
his
large
hand
,
and
cane
the
wearer
with
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
no
doubt
whatever
that
this
occupation
be
the
principal
solace
of
his
existence
.
   
<EOS>
a
profound
respect
for
money
pervade
Our
School
,
which
be
,
of
course
,
derive
from
its
Chief
.
 
<EOS>
We
remember
an
idiotic
goggle
-
eyed
boy
,
with
a
big
head
and
half
-
crown
without
end
,
who
suddenly
appear
as
a
parlour
-
boarder
,
and
be
rumour
to
have
come
by
sea
from
some
mysterious
part
of
the
earth
where
his
parent
roll
in
gold
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
usually
call
"
Mr
"
by
the
Chief
,
and
be
say
to
feed
in
the
parlour
on
steak
and
gravy
;
likewise
to
drink
currant
wine
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
openly
state
that
if
roll
and
coffee
be
ever
deny
him
at
breakfast
,
he
would
write
home
to
that
unknown
part
of
the
globe
from
which
he
have
come
,
and
cause
himself
to
be
recall
to
the
region
of
gold
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
put
into
no
form
or
class
,
but
learn
alone
,
as
little
as
he
like
---
and
he
like
very
little
---
and
there
be
a
belief
among
us
that
this
be
because
he
be
too
wealthy
to
be
"
take
down
.
"
 
<EOS>
His
special
treatment
,
and
our
vague
association
of
him
with
the
sea
,
and
with
storm
,
and
shark
,
and
Coral
Reefs
occasion
the
wildest
legend
to
be
circulate
as
his
history
.
 
<EOS>
a
tragedy
in
blank
verse
be
write
on
the
subject
---
if
our
memory
do
not
deceive
us
,
by
the
hand
that
now
chronicle
these
recollection
---
in
which
his
father
figure
as
a
Pirate
,
and
be
shoot
for
a
voluminous
catalogue
of
atrocity
:
first
impart
to
his
wife
the
secret
of
the
cave
in
which
his
wealth
be
store
,
and
from
which
his
only
son
's
half
-
crown
now
issue
.
 
<EOS>
Dumbledon
(
the
boy
's
name
)
be
represent
as
"
yet
unborn
"
when
his
brave
father
meet
his
fate
;
and
the
despair
and
grief
of
Mrs
Dumbledon
at
that
calamity
be
movingly
shadow
forth
as
have
weaken
the
parlour
-
boarder
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
this
production
be
receive
with
great
favour
,
and
be
twice
perform
with
closed
door
in
the
dining
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
it
get
wind
,
and
be
seize
as
libellous
,
and
bring
the
unlucky
poet
into
severe
affliction
.
 
<EOS>
some
two
year
afterwards
,
all
of
a
sudden
one
day
,
Dumbledon
vanish
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
whisper
that
the
Chief
himself
have
take
him
down
to
the
Docks
,
and
re
-
ship
him
for
the
Spanish
Main
;
but
nothing
certain
be
ever
know
about
his
disappearance
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
hour
,
we
can
not
thoroughly
disconnect
him
from
California
.
   
<EOS>
Our
School
be
rather
famous
for
mysterious
pupil
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
another
---
a
heavy
young
man
,
with
a
large
double
-
case
silver
watch
,
and
a
fat
knife
the
handle
of
which
be
a
perfect
tool
-
box
---
who
unaccountably
appear
one
day
at
a
special
desk
of
his
own
,
erect
close
to
that
of
the
Chief
,
with
whom
he
hold
familiar
converse
.
 
<EOS>
He
live
in
the
parlour
,
and
go
out
for
his
walk
,
and
never
take
the
least
notice
of
us
---
even
of
us
,
the
first
boy
---
unless
to
give
us
a
deprecatory
kick
,
or
grimly
to
take
our
hat
off
and
throw
it
away
,
when
he
encounter
us
out
of
door
,
which
unpleasant
ceremony
he
always
perform
as
he
pass
---
not
even
condescend
to
stop
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
us
believe
that
the
classical
attainment
of
this
phenomenon
be
terrific
,
but
that
his
penmanship
and
arithmetic
be
defective
,
and
he
have
come
there
to
mend
them
;
other
,
that
he
be
go
to
set
up
a
school
,
and
have
pay
the
Chief
"
twenty
-
five
pound
down
,
"
for
leave
to
see
Our
School
at
work
.
 
<EOS>
the
gloomy
spirit
even
say
that
he
be
go
to
buy
us
;
against
which
contingency
,
conspiracy
be
set
on
foot
for
a
general
defection
and
run
away
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
never
do
that
.
 
<EOS>
after
stay
for
a
quarter
,
during
which
period
,
though
closely
observe
,
he
be
never
see
to
do
anything
but
make
pen
out
of
quill
,
write
small
hand
in
a
secret
portfolio
,
and
punch
the
point
of
the
sharp
blade
in
his
knife
into
his
desk
all
over
it
,
he
too
disappear
,
and
his
place
know
him
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
another
boy
,
a
fair
,
meek
boy
,
with
a
delicate
complexion
and
rich
curling
hair
,
who
,
we
find
out
,
or
think
we
find
out
<EOS>
(
we
have
no
idea
now
,
and
probably
have
none
then
,
on
what
ground
,
but
it
be
confidentially
reveal
from
mouth
to
mouth
)
,
be
the
son
of
a
Viscount
who
have
desert
his
lovely
mother
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
understand
that
if
he
have
his
right
,
he
would
be
worth
twenty
thousand
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
and
that
if
his
mother
ever
meet
his
father
,
she
would
shoot
him
with
a
silver
pistol
,
which
she
carry
,
always
loaded
to
the
muzzle
,
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
very
suggestive
topic
.
 
<EOS>
so
be
a
young
Mulatto
,
who
be
always
believe
(
though
very
amiable
)
to
have
a
dagger
about
him
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
we
think
they
be
both
outshone
,
upon
the
whole
,
by
another
boy
who
claim
to
have
be
bear
on
the
twenty
-
ninth
of
February
,
and
to
have
only
one
birthday
in
five
year
.
 
<EOS>
We
suspect
this
to
have
be
a
fiction
---
but
he
live
upon
it
all
the
time
he
be
at
Our
School
.
   
<EOS>
the
principal
currency
of
Our
School
be
slate
pencil
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
some
inexplicable
value
,
that
be
never
ascertain
,
never
reduce
to
a
standard
.
 
<EOS>
to
have
a
great
hoard
of
it
be
somehow
to
be
rich
.
 
<EOS>
We
use
to
bestow
it
in
charity
,
and
confer
it
as
a
precious
boon
upon
our
choose
friend
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
holiday
be
come
,
contribution
be
solicit
for
certain
boy
whose
relative
be
in
India
,
and
who
be
appeal
for
under
the
generic
name
of
"
Holiday
-
stopper
,
"
---
appropriate
mark
of
remembrance
that
should
enliven
and
cheer
them
in
their
homeless
state
.
 
<EOS>
personally
,
we
always
contribute
these
token
of
sympathy
in
the
form
of
slate
pencil
,
and
always
feel
that
it
would
be
a
comfort
and
a
treasure
to
them
.
   
<EOS>
Our
School
be
remarkable
for
white
mouse
.
 
<EOS>
Red

poll
,
linnet
,
and
even
canary
,
be
keep
in
desk
,
drawer
,
hat
-
box
,
and
other
strange
refuge
for
bird
;
but
white
mouse
be
the
favourite
stock
.
<EOS>
the
boy
train
the
mouse
,
much
well
than
the
master
train
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
We
recall
one
white
mouse
,
who
live
in
the
cover
of
a
latin
dictionary
,
who
run
up
ladder
,
draw
roman
chariot
,
shouldered
musket
,
turn
wheel
,
and
even
make
a
very
creditable
appearance
on
the
stage
as
the
Dog
of
Montargis
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
have
achieve
great
thing
,
but
for
have
the
misfortune
to
mistake
his
way
in
a
triumphal
procession
to
the
Capitol
,
when
he
fall
into
a
deep
inkstand
,
and
be
dye
black
and
drown
.
 
<EOS>
the
mouse
be
the
occasion
of
some
most
ingenious
engineering
,
in
the
construction
of
their
house
and
instrument
of
performance
.
 
<EOS>
the
famous
one
belong
to
a
company
of
proprietor
,
some
of
whom
have
since
make
Railroads
,
Engines
,
and
Telegraphs
;
the
chairman
have
erect
mill
and
bridge
in
New
Zealand
.
   
<EOS>
the
usher
at
Our
School
,
who
be
consider
to
know
everything
as
oppose
to
the
Chief
,
who
be
consider
to
know
nothing
,
be
a
bony
,
gentle
-
faced
,
clerical
-
look
young
man
in
rusty
black
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
whisper
that
he
be
sweet
upon
one
of
Maxby
's
sister
(
Maxby
live
close
by
,
and
be
a
day
pupil
)
,
and
further
that
he
"
favour
Maxby
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
as
we
remember
,
he
teach
italian
to
Maxby
's
sister
on
half
-
holiday
.
 
<EOS>
He
once
go
to
the
play
with
them
,
and
wear
a
white
waistcoat
and
a
rose
:
which
be
consider
among
us
equivalent
to
a
declaration
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
of
opinion
on
that
occasion
,
that
to
the
last
moment
he
expect
Maxby
's
father
to
ask
him
to
dinner
at
five
o'clock
,
and
therefore
neglect
his
own
dinner
at
half
-
past
one
,
and
finally
get
none
.
 
<EOS>
We
exaggerate
in
our
imagination
the
extent
to
which
he
punish
Maxby
's
father
's
cold
meat
at
supper
;
and
we
agree
to
believe
that
he
be
elevate
with
wine
and
water
when
he
come
home
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
we
all
like
him
;
for
he
have
a
good
knowledge
of
boy
,
and
would
have
make
it
a
much
well
school
if
he
have
have
more
power
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
write
master
,
mathematical
master
,
english
master
,
<EOS>
make
out
the
bill
,
mend
the
pen
,
and
do
all
sort
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
He
divide
the
little
boy
with
the
latin
master
<EOS>
(
they
be
smuggle
through
their
rudimentary
book
,
at
odd
time
when
there
be
nothing
else
to
do
)
,
and
he
always
call
at
parent
'
house
to
inquire
after
sick
boy
,
because
he
have
gentlemanly
manner
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
rather
musical
,
and
on
some
remote
quarter
-
day
have
buy
an
old
trombone
;
but
a
bit
of
it
be
lose
,
and
it
make
the
most
extraordinary
sound
when
he
sometimes
try
to
play
it
of
an
evening
.
 
<EOS>
His
holiday
never
begin
(
on
account
of
the
bill
)
until
long
after
ours
;
but
,
in
the
summer
vacation
he
use
to
take
pedestrian
excursion
with
a
knapsack
;
and
at
Christmas
time
,
he
go
to
see
his
father
at
Chipping
Norton
,
who
we
all
say
(
on
no
authority
)
<EOS>
be
a
dairy
-
feed
pork
-
butcher
.
 
<EOS>
poor
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
low
all
day
on
Maxby
's
sister
's
wedding
-
day
,
and
afterwards
be
think
to
favour
Maxby
more
than
ever
,
though
he
have
be
expect
to
spite
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
dead
these
twenty
year
.
 
<EOS>
poor
fellow
!
   
<EOS>
Our
remembrance
of
Our
School
,
present
the
latin
master
as
a
colourless
double
-
up
near
-
sighted
man
with
a
crutch
,
who
be
always
cold
,
and
always
put
onion
into
his
ear
for
deafness
,
and
always
disclose
end
of
flannel
under
all
his
garment
,
and
almost
always
apply
a
ball
of
pocket
-
handkerchief
to
some
part
of
his
face
with
a
screw
action
round
and
round
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
very
good
scholar
,
and
take
great
pain
where
he
see
intelligence
and
a
desire
to
learn
:
<EOS>
otherwise
,
perhaps
not
.
 
<EOS>
Our
memory
present
him
(
unless
tease
into
a
passion
)
with
as
little
energy
as
colour
---
as
have
be
worry
and
torment
into
monotonous
feebleness
---
as
have
have
the
good
part
of
his
life
grind
out
of
him
in
a
mill
of
boy
.
 
<EOS>
We
remember
with
terror
how
he
fall
asleep
one
sultry
afternoon
with
the
little
smuggle
class
before
him
,
and
awake
not
when
the
footstep
of
the
Chief
fall
heavy
on
the
floor
;
how
the
Chief
arouse
him
,
in
the
midst
of
a
dread
silence
,
and
say
,
"
Mr
Blinkins
,
be
you
ill
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
how
he
blushingly
reply
,
"
Sir
,
rather
so
;
"
how
the
Chief
retort
with
severity
,
"
Mr
Blinkins
,
this
be
no
place
to
be
ill
in
"
(
which
be
very
,
very
true
)
,
and
walk
back
solemn
as
the
ghost
in
Hamlet
,
until
,
catch
a
wander
eye
,
he
call
that
boy
for
inattention
,
and
happily
express
his
feeling
towards
the
latin
master
through
the
medium
of
a
substitute
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
fat
little
dancing
-
master
who
use
to
come
in
a
gig
,
and
teach
the
more
advanced
among
us
hornpipe
(
as
an
accomplishment
in
great
social
demand
in
after
life
)
;
and
there
be
a
brisk
little
french
master
who
use
to
come
in
the
sunny
weather
,
with
a
handleless
umbrella
,
and
to
whom
the
Chief
be
always
polite
,
because
(
as
we
believe
)
,
if
the
Chief
offend
him
,
he
would
instantly
address
the
Chief
in
French
,
and
for
ever
confound
him
before
the
boy
with
his
inability
to
understand
or
reply
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
besides
,
a
serve
man
,
whose
name
be
Phil
.
 
<EOS>
Our
retrospective
glance
present
Phil
as
a
shipwreck
carpenter
,
cast
away
upon
the
desert
island
of
a
school
,
and
carry
into
practice
an
ingenious
inkling
of
many
trade
.
 
<EOS>
He
mend
whatever
be
break
,
and
make
whatever
be
want
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
general
glazier
,
among
other
thing
,
and
mend
all
the
broken
window
---
at
the
prime
cost
(
as
be
darkly
rumour
among
us
)
of
ninepence
,
for
every
square
charge
three
-
and
-
six
to
parent
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
a
high
opinion
of
his
mechanical
genius
,
and
generally
hold
that
the
Chief
"
know
something
bad
of
him
,
"
and
on
pain
of
divulgence
enforce
Phil
to
be
his
bondsman
.
 
<EOS>
We
particularly
remember
that
Phil
have
a
sovereign
contempt
for
learning
:
which
engender
in
us
a
respect
for
his
sagacity
,
as
it
imply
his
accurate
observation
of
the
relative
position
of
the
Chief
and
the
usher
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
an
impenetrable
man
,
who
wait
at
table
between
while
,
and
throughout
"
the
half
"
keep
the
box
in
severe
custody
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
morose
,
even
to
the
Chief
,
and
never
smile
,
except
at
break
-
up
,
when
,
in
acknowledgment
of
the
toast
,
"
success
to
Phil
!
 
<EOS>
Hooray
!
<EOS>
"
he
would
slowly
carve
a
grin
out
of
his
wooden
face
,
where
it
would
remain
until
we
be
all
go
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
one
time
when
we
have
the
scarlet
fever
in
the
school

It

give
rise

discussion

<EOS>
in

many

see
upon

at
one
time
;
and
it
be
on
the
same
great
occasion
that
DOGGINSON
---
regard
in
our
Vestry
as
"
a
regular
John
Bull
:
"
we
believe
,
in
consequence
of
his
have
always
make
up
his
mind
on
every
subject
without
know
anything
about

---
inform
another
gentleman
of
similar
principle
on
the
opposite
side
,
that
if
he
"
cheek'd
him
,
"
he
would
resort
to
the
extreme
measure
of
knock
his
blessed
head
off

<EOS>
this
be
a
great
occasion

<EOS>
but
,
our

,
it
be
very
strong

<EOS>
on
the

provocation

on

it

be
clamorous

whether
it

trample

<EOS>
Its
great
watchword
be
self

government

<EOS>
that
be
to
say
,
suppose
our
Vestry
to
favour
any
little
harmless
disorder
like
Typhus
Fever
,
and
suppose
the
Government
of
the
country
to
be
,
by
any
accident
,
in
such
ridiculous
hand
,
as
that
any
of
its
authority
should
consider
it
a
duty
to
object
to
Typhus
Fever
---
obviously
an
unconstitutional
objection
<EOS>
---
then
,
our
Vestry
cut
in
with
a
terrible
manifesto
about
self

government
,
and
claim
its
independent
right
to
have
as
much
Typhus
Fever
as
please
itself
.
<EOS>
some
absurd
and
dangerous
person
have
represent
,
on
the
other
hand
,
that
though
our
Vestry
may
be
able
to
"
beat
the
bound
"
of
its
own
parish
,
it
may
not
be
able
to
beat
the
bound
of
its
own
disease
;
which
(
say
they
)
spread
over
the
whole
land
,
in
an
ever
expand
circle
of
waste
,
and
misery
,
and
death

<EOS>
but

our

short
work

<EOS>
It

that
in

on
the

<EOS>
Mr

(
with
his

on

paper
)
that
in
reference
to
the
question
which
have
be
put
to
him
by

he
must
take
leave

that
if
that

have
have
the
courtesy
to
give
him
notice
of
that
question
,
he
(
Mr

would
have
consult

to
the
advisability
,
in
the
present
state
of
the
discussion
on
the
new

of
answer
that
question

<EOS>
but
,
as
the
honourable

have
not
have
the
courtesy
to
give
him
notice
of
that
question
(
great
cheering
from
the

<EOS>
,
he
must
decline

the
satisfaction

Mr

for

<EOS>
Mr

that

fold
his

like
Napoleon
Buonaparte

and
to
snort
in
his
breathing

too
expressive
of
gunpowder

<EOS>
the

intense
emotion

prevail

<EOS>
several
member
cluster
in
remonstrance
round
the
Captain

and
several

Mr

but

both

<EOS>
Mr

amid
tremendous

and
rapturously

only
one
dissentient

<EOS>
this

who
say
from
his

<EOS>
"

out
with

"
but
whose
coarse

<EOS>
the
beadle
now
advance
along
the
floor
of
the
Vestry
,
and
beckon
with
his
cocked
hat
to

<EOS>
every

<EOS>
to

would
be
feebly

<EOS>
suddenly
,
enthusiastic
cheering
break
out
from
every
side

<EOS>
Captain

have
rise

<EOS>
the

in

<EOS>
Hereupon
the

<EOS>
Mr
Tiddypot
instantly
rise
,
and
be
receive
with
the
same
encouragement

<EOS>
He
likewise
say
---
and
the
exquisite
art

to
the
observation
an
air
of
freshness

<EOS>
"

"
 
<EOS>
Captain
Banger
immediately
start
up
again
,
and
say
that
after
those
observation
,
involve
as
they
do
ample
concession
to
his
honour
without
compromise
the
honour
of
the
honourable
gentleman
,
he
would
be
want
in
honour
as
well
as
in
generosity
,
if
he
do
not
at
once
repudiate
all
intention
of
wound
the
honour
of
the

,
or
say
anything
dishonourable
to
his
honourable
feeling

<EOS>
these
observation
be
repeatedly
interrupt
by
burst
of
cheer
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tiddypot
retort
that
he
well
know
the
spirit
of
honour
by
which
the
honourable
and
gallant
gentleman
be
so
honourably
animate
,
and
that
he
accept
an
honourable
explanation
,
offer
in
a
way
that
do
him
honour
;
but
,
he
trust
that
the
Vestry
would
consider
that
his
(
Mr
Tiddypot
's
)
honour
have
imperatively
demand
of
him
that
painful
course
which
he
have
feel
it
due
to
his
honour
to
adopt
.
 
<EOS>
the
Captain
and
Mr
Tiddypot
then
touch
their
hat
to
one
another
across
the
Vestry
,
a
great
many
time
,
and
it
be
think
that
these
proceeding
(
report
to
the
extent
of
several
column
in
next
Sunday
's
paper
)
will
bring
them
in
as
church
-
warden
next
year
.
   
<EOS>
all
this
be
strictly
after
the
pattern
of
the
real
original
,
and
so
be
the
whole
of
our
Vestry
's
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
in
all
their
debate
,
they
be
laudably
imitative
of
the
windy
and
wordy
slang
of
the
real
original
,
and
of
nothing
that
be
well
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
head
-
strong
party
animosity
,
without
any
reference
to
the
merit
of
question
;
they
tack
a
surprising
amount
of
debate
to
a
very
little
business
;
they
set
more
store
by
form
than
they
do
by
substance
:
---
all
very
like
the
real
original
!
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
doubt
in
our
borough
,
whether
our
Vestry
be
of
any
utility
;
but
our
own
conclusion
be
,
that
it
be
of
the
use
to
the
Borough
that
a
diminish
mirror
be
to
a
painter
,
as
enable
it
to
perceive
in
a
small
focus
of
absurdity
all
the
surface
defect
of
the
real
original
.
    
<EOS>
Our
Bore
 
<EOS>
It
be
unnecessary
to
say
that
we
keep
a
bore
.
 
<EOS>
everybody
do
.
<EOS>
but
,
the
bore
whom
we
have
the
pleasure
and
honour
of
enumerate
among
our
particular
friend
,
be
such
a
generic
bore
,
and
have
so
many
trait
(
as
it
appear
to
us
)
in
common
with
the
great
bore
family
,
that
we
be
tempt
to
make
him
the
subject
of
the
present
note
.
 
<EOS>
May
he
be
generally
accept
!
   
<EOS>
Our
bore
be
admit
on
all
hand
to
be
a
good
-
hearted
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
put
fifty
people
out
of
temper
,
but
he
keep
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
He
preserve
a
sickly
solid
smile
upon
his
face
,
when
other
face
be
ruffle
by
the
perfection
he
have
attain
in
his
art
,
and
have
an
equable
voice
which
never
travel
out
of
one
key
or
rise
above
one
pitch
.
 
<EOS>
His
manner
be
a
manner
of
tranquil
interest
.
 
<EOS>
none
of
his
opinion
be
startling
.
 
<EOS>
among
his
deepest
-
root
conviction
,
it
may
be
mention
that
he
consider
the
air
of
England
damp
,
and
hold
that
our
lively
neighbour
---
he
always
call
the
french
our
lively
neighbour
---
have
the
advantage
of
us
in
that
particular
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
he
be
unable
to
forget
that
John
Bull
be
John
Bull
all
the
world
over
,
and
that
England
with
all
her
fault
be
England
still
.
   
<EOS>
Our
bore
have
travel
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
possibly
be
a
complete
bore
without
have
travel
.
 
<EOS>
He
rarely
speak
of
his
travel
without
introduce
,
sometimes
on
his
own
plan
of
construction
,
morsel
of
the
language
of
the
country
---
which
he
always
translate
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
name
to
him
any
little
remote
town
in
France
,
Italy
,
Germany
,
or
Switzerland
<EOS>
but
he
know
it
well
;
stay
there
a
fortnight
under
peculiar
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
and
talk
of
that
little
place
,
perhaps
you
know
a
statue
over
an
old
fountain
,
up
a
little
court
,
which
be
the
second
---
no
,
the
third
---
stay
---
<EOS>
yes
,
the
third
turning
on
the
right
,
after
you
come
out
of
the
Post
-
house
,
go
up
the
hill
towards
the
market
?
 
<EOS>
You
don't
know
that
statue
?
 
<EOS>
nor
that
fountain
?
 
<EOS>
You
surprise
him
!
 
<EOS>
They
be
not
usually
see
by
traveller
(
most
extraordinary
,
he
have
never
yet
meet
with
a
single
traveller
who
know
them
,
except
one
German
,
the
most
intelligent
man
he
ever
meet
in
his
life
!
)
<EOS>
but
he
think
that
you
would
have
be
the
man
to
find
them
out
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
describe
them
,
in
a
circumstantial
lecture
half
an
hour
long
,
generally
deliver
behind
a
door
which
be
constantly
be
open
from
the
other
side
;
and
implore
you
,
if
you
ever
revisit
that
place
,
now
do
go
and
look
at
that
statue
and
fountain
!
   
<EOS>
Our
bore
,
in
a
similar
manner
,
be
in
Italy
,
make
a
discovery
of
a
dreadful
picture
,
which
have
be
the
terror
of
a
large
portion
of
the
civilized
world
ever
since
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
see
the
lively
man
paralyse
by
it
,
across
a
broad
dining
-
table
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
lounge
among
the
mountain
,
sir
,
bask
in
the
mellow
influence
of
the
climate
,
when
he
come
to
UNA
PICCOLA
CHIESA
---
a
little
church
---
or
perhaps
it
would
be
more
correct
to
say
UNA
PICCOLISSIMA
CAPPELLA
---
the
small
chapel
you
can
possibly
imagine
---
and
walk
in
.
<EOS>
there
be
nobody
inside
but
a
cieco
---
a
blind
man
---
say
his
prayer
,
and
a
VECCHIO
PADRE
---
old
friar
-
rattle
a
money
-
box
.
<EOS>
but
,
above
the
head
of
that
friar
,
and
immediately
to
the
right
of
the
altar
as
you
enter
---
to
the
right
of
the
altar
?
 
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
to
the
left
of
the
altar
as
you
enter
---
or
say
near
the
centre
---
there
hang
a
painting
(
subject
,
Virgin
and
Child
)
<EOS>
so
divine
in
its
expression
,
so
pure
and
yet
so
warm
and
rich
in
its
tone
,
so
fresh
in
its
touch
,
at
once
so
glow
in
its
colour
and
so
statuesque
in
its
repose
,
that
our
bore
cry
out
in
ecstasy
,
"
that
be
the
fine
picture
in
Italy
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
so
it
be
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
astonishing
that
that
picture
be
so
little
known
.
 
<EOS>
even
the
painter
be
uncertain
.
 
<EOS>
He
afterwards
take
Blumb
,
of
the
Royal
Academy
<EOS>
(
it
be
to
be
observe
that
our
bore
take
none
but
eminent
people
to
see
sight
,
and
that
none
but
eminent
people
take
our
bore
)
,
and
you
never
see
a
man
so
affected
in
your
life
as
Blumb
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
cry
like
a
child
!
 
<EOS>
and
then
our
bore
begin
his
description
in
detail
<EOS>
---
for
all
this
be
introductory
---
and
strangle
his
hearer
with
the
fold
of
the
purple
drapery
.
   
<EOS>
by
an
equally
fortunate
conjunction
of
accidental
circumstance
,
it
happen
that
when
our
bore
be
in
Switzerland
,
he
discover
a
Valley
,
of
that
superb
character
,
that
Chamouni
be
not
to
be
mention
in
the
same
breath
with
it

<EOS>
this
be
how
it
be
,
sir

<EOS>
He
be
travel
on
a
mule

have
be
in

some
day

<EOS>
when
,
as
he
and
the

Pierre
Blanquo

whom
you
may
know
,
perhaps
?
---
<EOS>
our
bore
be
sorry
you
do
not
,
because
he
be
the
only
guide
deserving
of
the
name
---
as
he
and
Pierre
be
descend
,
towards
evening
,
among
those
everlasting
snow
,
to
the
little
village
of
La
Croix
,
our
bore
observe
a
mountain
track
turn
off
sharply
to
the
right
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
he
be
uncertain
whether
it
be
a
track
at
all
,
and
<EOS>
in
fact
,
he
say
to
Pierre
,
"
QU'EST
<EOS>
QUE

MON

<EOS>
IL

"
 
<EOS>
but
,
our
bore
be
not
to
be
do
in
that
way
,
and
he
firmly
reply
,
"
I
wish
to
go

"
 
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
which
firmness
on
our
bore
's
part
,
they
proceed
,
sir
,
during
two
hour
of
evening
,
and
three
of
moonlight
(
they
wait
in
a
cavern
till
the
moon
be
up
)
,
along
the
slender
track
,
overhang
perpendicularly
the
most
awful
gulf
,
until
they
arrive
,
by
a
wind
descent
,
in
a
valley
that
possibly
,
and
he
may
say
probably
,
be
never

by
any
stranger

<EOS>
what
a

<EOS>
the

benevolent
old
lady
who

and
her
charming
daughter
,
Fanchette
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
nothing
to
say
that
they
be
attentive
to
him
;
they
dote
on
him
.
<EOS>
They
call
him
in
their
simple
way
,
<EOS>
L'ANGE
ANGLAIS
---
the
English
Angel

<EOS>
when
our
bore
leave
the
valley

there
be
not
a
dry
eye
in
the
place

some
of
the
people

him
for

<EOS>
He
beg
and
entreat
of
you
as
a
personal
favour

from
Haroun
Alraschid
to

<EOS>
He
be
in
the
habit
of

mysterious
opinion
on

wide
range
of

great
consideration
from

and
have

<EOS>
the

commit
in

by
this
eastern
brother
<EOS>
be
beyond
belief
.
 
<EOS>
Our

<EOS>
We
have
know

to
fall
upon
an
intelligent
young
sojourner
in
the
wilderness
,
in
the
first
sentence
of
a
narrative
,
and
beat
all
confidence
out
of
him
with
one
blow
of
his
brother
.
<EOS>
He
become
omniscient
,
as
to
foreign
policy
,
in
the
smoking
of
those
pipe
with
Mehemet
Ali
.
 
<EOS>
the
balance
of
power
in
Europe
,
the
machination
of
the
Jesuits
,
the
gentle
and
humanise
influence
of
Austria
,
the
position
and
prospect
of
that
hero
of
the
noble
soul
who
be
worship
by
happy
France
,
be
all
easy
reading
to

<EOS>
and
our

be
so
provokingly
self

"
I

general

"
say
he

after
enervate
the

"
   
<EOS>
the
common
incident
and
place
would
appear
to
have
be
make
special

<EOS>
ask

<EOS>
He

under
some
remarkably
propitious
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
there
be
no
fancy
in
it
,
because
in
every
case
the
showman
mention
the
fact
at

<EOS>
at

<EOS>
It

what
a
blessing

be
until
one
have
lose

,
be
remind
of
that
illness
,
and

<EOS>
innocently
remark
that

be
not
well
,
or
that
somebody
else
be
not
well
,
and
the
same
inevitable
result
ensue
.
<EOS>
You
will
learn
how
our
bore
feel
a
tightness
about
here
,
sir
,
for
which
he
could
not
account
,
accompany
with
a
constant
sensation
as
if
he
be
be
stab
---
or
,
rather
,
job

,
and
hammer
to
beat
incessantly
,
thump
,
thump
,
thump
,
all
down
his
back
---
along
the
whole
of
the
spinal
vertebrae
.
 
<EOS>
Our
bore
,
when
his
sensation
have
come
to
this
,
think
it
a
duty
he
owe
to
himself
to
take
advice
,
and
he
say
,
now
,
whom
shall
I
consult
?
 
<EOS>
He
naturally
think
of
Callow
,
at
that
time
one
of
the
most
eminent
physician
in
London
,
and
he
go
to
Callow
.
<EOS>
Callow
say
,
"
Liver
!
"
and
prescribed
rhubarb
and
calomel
,
low
diet
,
and
moderate
exercise
.
 
<EOS>
Our
bore
go
on
with
this
treatment
,
get
bad
every
day
,
until
he
lose
confidence
in
Callow
,
and
go
to
Moon
,
whom
half
the
town
be
then
mad
about
.
 
<EOS>
Moon
be
interested
in
the
case
;
to
do
him
justice
he
be
very
much
interested
in
the
case
;
and
he
say
,
"
Kidneys
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
alter
the
whole
treatment
,
sir
---
give
strong
acid
,
cup
,
and
blister
.
<EOS>
this
go
on
,
our
bore
still
get
bad
every
day
,
until
he
openly
tell
Moon
it
would
be
a
satisfaction
to
him
if
he
would
have
a
consultation
with
Clatter
.
 
<EOS>
the
moment
Clatter
see
our
bore
<EOS>
,
he
say
,
"
accumulation
of
fat
about
the
heart
!
"
 
<EOS>
Snugglewood
,
who
be
call
in
with
him
,
differ
,
and
say
,
"
brain
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
,
what
they
all
agree
upon
be
,
to
lay
our
bore
upon
his
back
,
to
shave
his
head
,
to
leech
him
,
to
administer
enormous
quantity
of
medicine
,
and
to
keep
him
low
;
so
that
he
be
reduce
to
a
mere
shadow
,
you
would
not
have
know
him
,
and
nobody
consider
it
possible
that
he
could
ever
recover
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
his
condition
,
sir
,
when
he
hear
of
Jilkins
---
at
that
period
in
a
very
small
practice
,
and
live
in
the
upper
part
of
a
house
in
Great
Portland
Street
;
but
still

understand
,
with
a
rise

among
the
few
people

condition
in

,
"
Mr
Jilkins
,
I

a
presentiment
that

.
"
 
<EOS>
Jilkins
's
reply
be
characteristic
of
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
,
"
Sir

I
mean
to
do
you
good
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
confirm
our
bore
's
opinion
of
his
eye
,
and
they
go
into
the
case
together
---
go
completely
into
it
.
 
<EOS>
Jilkins
then
get

<EOS>
His

transaction
,
and
it
be
fifteen
thousand
five
hundred
pound

and
his
income
be
twelve
thousand
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
Our
bore
be
also
great
in
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
He
believe
,
with
an
exasperating
appearance
of
profound
meaning
,
that

<EOS>
---

.
<EOS>
---

<EOS>
---
Our

be
surprised
at

<EOS>
---
why
?
---

<EOS>
only

that
Parkins
have
come
to
tell

something
.
<EOS>
---

<EOS>
---
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
our
bore
be
not
at
liberty
to
mention
what
about
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
he
believe
you
will
hear
that
from
Parkins
himself
,
soon
,
and
he
hope
it
may
not
surprise
you
as
it
do
him
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
,
however
,
you
never
hear
about
Parkins
's
wife
's
sister
?
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
no
.
---
<EOS>
ah

say
our
bore
,
that
explain
it
!
   
<EOS>
Our
bore
be
also
great
in
argument
.
 
<EOS>
He
infinitely
enjoy
a
long
humdrum
,
drowsy
interchange
of
word
of
dispute
about
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
He
consider
that
it
strengthen
the
mind
,
consequently
<EOS>
,
he
"
do
not
see
that
,
"
very
often
.
 
<EOS>
or
,
he
would
be
glad
to
know
what
you
mean
by
that
.
 
<EOS>
or
,
he
doubt
that
.
 
<EOS>
or
,
he
have
always
understand
exactly
the
reverse
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
or
,
he
can
not
admit
that
.
 
<EOS>
or
,
he
beg
to
deny
that
.
 
<EOS>
or
,
surely
you
do
not
mean
that
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
on
.
 
<EOS>
He
once
advise
us
;
offer
us
a
piece
of
advice
,
after
the
fact
,
totally
impracticable
and
wholly
impossible
of
acceptance
,
because
it
suppose
the
fact
,
then
eternally
disposed
of
,
to
be
yet
in
abeyance
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
dozen
year
ago
,
and
to
this
hour
our
bore
benevolently
wish
,
in
a
mild
voice
,
on
certain
regular
occasion
,
that
we
have
think
better
of
his
opinion
.
   
<EOS>
the
instinct
with
which
our
bore
find
out
another
bore
,
and
close
with
him
,
be
amazing
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
see
him
pick
his
man
out
of
fifty
man
,
in
a
couple
of
minute
.
 
<EOS>
They
love
to
go
(
which
they
do
naturally
)
into
a
slow
argument
on
a
previously
exhaust
subject
,
and
to
contradict
each
other
,
and
to
wear
the
hearer
out
,
without
impair
their
own
perennial
freshness
as
bore
.
 
<EOS>
It
improve
the
good
understanding
between
them
,
and
they
get
together
afterwards
,
and
bear
each
other
amicably
.
 
<EOS>
whenever
we
see
our
bore
behind
a
door
with
another
bore
,
we
know
that
when
he
come
forth
,
he
will
praise
the
other
bore
as
one
of
the
most
intelligent
man
he
ever
meet
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
bring
us
to
the
close
of
what
we
have
to
say
about
our
bore
,
we
be
anxious
to
have
it
understand
that
he
never
bestow
this
praise
on
us
.

Council
assemble
in
the
City
of
London
,
in
the
year
of
our
Lord
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
fifty
,
that
the
French
be
a
frog
-
eat
people
,
who
wear
wooden
shoe
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
credibly
inform
,
in
reference
to
the
nation
whom
this
choice
spirit
so
happily
disposed
of
,
that
the
caricature
and
stage
representation
which
be
current
in
England
some
half
a
century
ago
,
exactly
depict
their
present
condition
.
 
<EOS>
for
example
,
we
understand
that
every
Frenchman
,
without
exception
,
wear
a
pigtail
and
curl
-
paper
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
be
extremely
sallow
,
thin
,
long
-
faced
,
and
lantern
-
jaw
.
 
<EOS>
that
the
calf
of
his
leg
be
invariably
undeveloped
;
that
his
leg
fail
at
the
knee
,
and
that
his
shoulder
be
always
high
than
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
likewise
assure
that
he
rarely
taste
any
food
but
soup
maigre
,
and
an
onion
;
that
he
always
say
,
"
by
Gar
!
<EOS>
aha
!
<EOS>
vat
<EOS>
you
tell
me
,
sare
?
<EOS>
"
at
the
end
of
every
sentence
he
utter
;
and
that
the
true
generic
name
of
his
race
be
the
Mounseers
,
or
the
Parly
-
voos
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
be
not
a
dancing
-
master
,
or
a
barber
,
he
must
be
a
cook
;
since
no
other
trade
but
those
three
be
congenial
to
the
taste
of
the
people
,
or
permit
by
the
institution
of
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
slave
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
the
lady
of
France
(
who
be
also
slave
)
invariably
have
their
head
tie
up
in
Belcher
handkerchief
,
wear
long
earring
,
carry
tambourine
,
and
beguile
the
weariness
of
their
yoke
by
singe
in
head
voice
through
their
nose
---
principally
to
barrel
-
organ
.
   
<EOS>
It
may
be
generally
sum
up
,
of
this
inferior
people
,
that
they
have
no
idea
of
anything
.
   
<EOS>
of
a
great
institution
like
Smithfield
,
they
be
unable
to
form
the
least
conception
.
 
<EOS>
a
Beast
Market
in
the
heart
of
Paris
would
be
regard
an
impossible
nuisance
.
 
<EOS>
nor
have
they
any
notion
of
slaughter
-
house
in
the
midst
of
a
city
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
these
benighted
frog
-
eater
would
scarcely
understand
your
meaning
,
if
you
tell
him
of
the
existence
of
such
a
british
bulwark
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
agreeable
,
and
perhaps
pardonable
,
to
indulge
in
a
little
self
-
complacency
when
our
right
to
it
be
thoroughly
establish
.
<EOS>
at
the
present
time
,
to
be
render
memorable
by
a
final
attack
on
that
good
old
market
which
be
the
(
rotten
)
apple
of
the
Corporation
's
eye
,
let
us
compare
ourselves
,
to
our
national
delight
and
pride
as
to
these
two
subject
of
slaughter
-
house
and
beast
-
market
,
with
the
outlandish
foreigner
.
   
<EOS>
the
blessing
of
Smithfield
be
too
well
understand
to
need
recapitulation
;
all
who
run
(
away
from
mad
bull
and
pursue
oxen
)
may
read
.
 
<EOS>
any
market

day
they
may
be
behold
in
glorious
action
.
<EOS>
possibly
the
merit
of
our
slaughter

house
be
not
yet
quite
so
generally
appreciate

<EOS>
slaughter

<EOS>
most

the
most

place

where
there
be
the

<EOS>
They
be
often
underground

in

they

sometimes
in

sometimes
(
as
in
Spitalfields

in
the
very

the
meat

occasionally
,
under
good

they
be
ventilate

clean

for

they

the

in

<EOS>
some
of
them
be
close

in

<EOS>
when
the
slaughter

house
be
below
the

,
it
be
a
common
practice
to
throw
the
sheep
down
area

neck

exciting

not

cruel

when

it
be
often
extremely
difficult

tail

for
a
long

which
be
entirely
owing

foul

It

these
UNcommon
counsellor

your

will
contend
that
to
tolerate
these
thing
in
a
civilised
city
,
be
to
reduce
it
to
a
bad
condition
than
BRUCE
find
to
prevail
in

for
there
(
say
they
)
<EOS>
the
jackal

wild
dog
come

to
devour
the
offal
;
whereas
,
here
there
be
no
such
natural
scavenger
,
and
quite
as
savage
custom
.
 
<EOS>
further
,
they
will
demonstrate
that
nothing
in
Nature
be
intend
to
be
waste
,
and
that
besides
the
waste
which
such
abuse
occasion
in
the
article
of
health

---
main
source
of
the
rich
of

they
lead
to
a
prodigious
waste
of
change
matter
,
which
may
,
with
proper
preparation
,
and
under
scientific
direction
,
be
safely
apply
to
the
increase
of
the
fertility
of
the
land
.
 
<EOS>
thus
(
they
argue
)
do
nature
ever
avenge
infraction
of
her
beneficent
law
,
and
so
surely
as
Man
be
determined
to
warp
any
of
her
blessing
into
curse

shall
they
become

but

this
be
can

<EOS>
just
as
it
be
can
not
of
the
bad
description
to
say
to
the
London
Corporation
,
"
how
can
you
exhibit
to

so
plain
a
spectacle

dishonest

hold
a

now
to
the
comparison

the

the

<EOS>
in

there

every

him

may
compare
it
with
what

all

for
the
innovate

here
follow
a
short
account

a
recent
visit

these

<EOS>
It
be
as
sharp
a
February
morning
as
you
would
desire

I
turn
out

tumble
over
a

a
cold

dim

touch
the
high
roof
of
the
tuilerie
which
have
see
such
change
,
such
distract
crowd
,
such
riot
and
bloodshed
;
and
they
look
as
calm

as
old

all
cover

white

as

there
be
not
light
enough
,
yet
,
to
strike
upon
the
tower
of
Notre

across
the
water
;
but
I
think
of
the
dark
pavement
of
the
old
Cathedral
as
just
begin
to
be
streak
with
grey

and
of
the

the

close

it

burn
low
and

Morgue
go
about
with
a

busy
in

his
terrible
waxwork

another
sunny

the

up

merrily
when
the

announce
our

rattle
away
for
the
Cattle
Market

cold

shady
place

glitter
in

<EOS>
out
leap
the
butcher

who
have
be
chatter
all
the
way
like
madman

and
off
they

which
be
opposite

open
on
another
small
yard
,
where
the
sheep
and
calf
be
kill
on
bench
.
 
<EOS>
the
pavement
of
that
yard
,
I
see
,
slope
downward
to
a
gutter
,
for
its
be
more
easily
cleanse
.
 
<EOS>
the
slaughter
-
house
be
fifteen
foot
high
,
sixteen
foot
and
a
-
half
wide
,
and
thirty
-
three
foot
long
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
fit
with
a
powerful
windlass
,
by
which
one
man
at
the
handle
can
bring
the
head
of
an
ox
down
to
the
ground
to
receive
the
blow
from
the
pole
-
axe
that
be
to
fell
him
---
with
the
mean
of
raise
the
carcass
and
keep
it
suspend
during
the
after
-
operation
of
dressing
---
and
with
hook
on
which
carcass
can
hang
,
when
completely
prepared
,
without
touch
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
upon
the
pavement
of
this
first
stone
chamber
,
lie
an
ox
scarcely
dead
.
<EOS>
if
I
except
the
blood
drain
from
him
,
into
a
little
stone
well
in
a
corner
of
the
pavement
,
the
place
be
free
from
offence
as
the
Place
de
la
Concorde
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
infinitely
purer
and
clean
,
I
know
,
my
friend
the
functionary
,
than
the
Cathedral
of
Notre
Dame
.
 
<EOS>
ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Monsieur
be
pleasant
,
but
,
truly
,
there
be
reason
,
too
,
in
what
he
say
.
   
<EOS>
I
look
into
another
of
these
slaughter
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
pray
enter
,
"
say
a
gentleman
in
bloody
boot
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
calf
I
have
kill
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
have
a
little
time
upon
my
hand
,
I
have
cut
and
puncture
this
lace
pattern
in
the
coat
of
his
stomach
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
pretty
enough
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
it
to
divert
myself
.
"
<EOS>
---
"
It
be
beautiful
,
Monsieur
,
the
slaughterer
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
I
have
the
gentility
to
say
so
.
   
<EOS>
I
look
into
row
of
slaughter
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
in
many
,
retail
dealer
,
who
have
come
here
for
the
purpose
,
be
make
bargain
for
meat
.
<EOS>
there
be
kill
enough
,
certainly
,
to
satiate
an
unused
eye
;
and
there
be
steam
carcass
enough
,
to
suggest
the
expediency
of
a
fowl
and
salad
for
dinner
;
but
,
everywhere
,
there
be
an
orderly
,
clean
,
well
-
systematise
routine
of
work
in
progress
---
horrible
work
at
the
good
,
if
you
please
;
but
,
so
much
the
great
reason
why
it
should
be
make
the
good
of
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
<EOS>
(
I
think
I
have
observe
,
my
name
be
Bull
)
that
a
Parisian
of
the
low
order
be
particularly
delicate
,
or
that
his
nature
be
remarkable
for
an
infinitesimal
infusion
of
ferocity
;
but
,
I
do
know
,
my
potent
,
grave
,
and
common
counselling
signor
,
that
he
be
force
,
when
at
this
work
,
to
submit
himself
to
a
thoroughly
good
system
,
and
to
make
an
Englishman
very
heartily
ashamed
of
you
.
   
<EOS>
here
,
within
the
wall
of
the
same
abattoir
,
in
other
roomy
and
commodious
building
,
be
a
place
for
convert
the
fat
into
tallow
and
pack
it
for
market
---
a
place
for
cleansing
and
scald
calf
'
head
and
sheep
's
foot
---
a
place
for
prepare
tripe
---
stable
and
coach
-
house
for
the
butcher
---
innumerable
convenience
,
aid
in
the
diminution
of
offensiveness
to
its
low
possible
point
,
and
the
raising
of
cleanliness
and
supervision
to
their
high
.
 
<EOS>
hence
,
all
the
meat
that
go
out
of
the
gate
be
send
away
in
clean
covered
cart
.
 
<EOS>
and
if
every
trade
connect
with
the
slaughtering
of
animal
be
oblige
by
law
to
be
carry
on
in
the
same
place
,
I
doubt
,
my
friend
,
now
reinstate
in
the
cocked
hat
(
whose
civility
these
two
franc
imperfectly
acknowledge
,
but
appear
munificently
to
repay
)
,
whether
there
could
be
well
regulation
than
those
which
be
carry
out
at
the
Abattoir
of
Montmartre
.
 
<EOS>
Adieu
,
my
friend
,
for
I
be
away
to
the
other
side
of
Paris
,
to
the
Abattoir
of
Grenelle
!
 
<EOS>
and
there
I
find
exactly
the
same
thing
on
a
small
scale
,
with
the
addition
of
a
magnificent
Artesian
well
,
and
a
different
sort
of
conductor
,
in
the
person
of
a
neat
little
woman
with
neat
little
eye
,
and
a
neat
little
voice
,
who
pick
her
neat
little
way
among
the
bullock
in
a
very
neat
little
pair
of
shoe
and
stocking
.
   
<EOS>
such
be
the
Monument
of
French
Folly
which
a
foreigneere
people
have
erect
,
in
a
national
hatred
and
antipathy
for
common
counselling
wisdom
.
 
<EOS>
that
wisdom
,
assemble
in
the
City
of
London
,
have
distinctly
refuse
,
after
a
debate
of
three
day
long
,
and
by
a
majority
of
nearly
seven
to
one
,
to
associate
itself
with
any
Metropolitan
Cattle
Market
unless
it
be
hold
in
the
midst
of
the
City
,
it
follow
that
we
shall
lose
the
inestimable
advantage
of
common
counselling
protection
,
and
be
throw
,
for
a
market
,
on
our
own
wretched
resource
.
 
<EOS>
in
all
human
probability
we
shall
thus
come
,
at
last
,
to
erect
a
monument
of
folly
very
like
this
french
monument
.
 
<EOS>
if
that
be
do
,
the
consequence
be
obvious
.
 
<EOS>
the
leather
trade
will
be
ruin
,
by
the
introduction
of
american
timber
,
to
be
manufacture
into
shoe
for
the
fall
English
;
the
Lord
Mayor
will
be
require
,
by
the
popular
voice
,
to
live
entirely
on
frog
;
and
both
these
change
will
(
how
,
be
not
at
present
quite
clear
,
but
certainly
somehow
or
other
)
fall
on
that
unhappy
land
interest
which
be
always
be
kill
,
yet
be
always
find
to
be
alive
---
and
kick
.
