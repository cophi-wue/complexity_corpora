<EOS>
on
the
bank
of
the
beautiful
Ohio
,
some
five
or
six
mile
above
the
large
and
flourish
city
of
Cincinnati
,
can
be
see
the
small
and
pleasant
village
of
Columbia
,
once
lay
out
and
design
to
become
the
capital
of
the
great
West
.
<EOS>
this
village
stand
on
a
beautiful
plain
,
which
stretch
away
from
the
Ohio
in
a
north
-
easterly
direction
,
between
two
ridge
,
for
a
goodly
number
of
mile
,
and
at
the
base
of
what
be
term
Bald
Hill
—
a
hill
of
a
conical
shape
,
from
the
summit
<EOS>
whereof
you
can
command
every
point
of
compass
,
and
some
of
the
most
delightful
view
in
the
western
country
.
<EOS>
stand
upon
this
hill
,
with
your
face
toward
the
south
,
you
first
behold
,
immediately
below
you
,
a
cluster
of
dwelling
,
mostly
white
,
with
their
green
lawn
in
front
,
and
their
flowery
garden
in
the
rear
,
with
one
or
two
neat
,
unostentatious
looking
church
rise
above
them
,
as
if
to
give
a
quiet
and
moral
beauty
,
if
we
may
so
express
it
,
to
the
scene
.
<EOS>
be
yond
these
building
,
which
constitute
the
principal
village
of
Columbia
,
the
eye
at
once
fall
upon
an
open
,
variegated
and
fertile
plain
,
over
which
it
wander
for
something
like
a
mile
,
to
rest
again
for
a
moment
upon
a
few
brick
and
wood
-
colored
house
,
half
hide
amid
a
grove
of
beautiful
tree
,
then
upon
the
smooth
,
silvery
Ohio
,
which
here
come
sweeping
past
with
a
graceful
bend
,
and
,
<EOS>
lastly
,
upon
the
green
and
romantic
looking
hill
of
old
Kentucky
.
<EOS>
turn
to
the
left
,
or
eastward
,
you
behold
,
some
mile
or
two
mile
distant
,
a
woody
ridge
,
which
intersect
the
Ohio
at
right
angle
,
and
,
stretch
away
northward
,
form
the
eastern
boundary
of
the
plain
.
<EOS>
at
the
base
of
this
ridge
,
can
be
see
,
here
and
there
,
a
quiet
farm
-
house
,
and
portion
of
the
Little
Miami
,
as
it
roll
its
silvery
water
onward
through
a
most
delightful
grove
,
to
unite
with
,
and
be
lose
in
,
the
placid
bosom
of
La
Belle
Riviere
.
<EOS>
between
you
and
the
Little
Miami
,
and
for
many
a
mile
up
toward
its
source
,
lie
the
plain
we
have
mention
,
now
divide
as
far
as
you
can
see
,
into
lot
of
four
or
five
acre
each
,
all
of
which
,
be
under
cultivation
,
present
,
in
the
summer
season
,
with
their
different
product
,
a
pleasing
variety
of
color
,
as
if
to
enchain
the
attention
of
the
beholder
with
an
unspeakable
sensation
of
delight
.
<EOS>
follow
the
course
of
the
plain
away
to
the
north
-
east
,
you
behold
,
some
few
mile
distant
,
another
pleasant
village
,
with
its
neat
,
white
house
peep
from
among
the
green
foliage
of
the
surround
tree
.
<EOS>
turn
again
to
the
south
and
west
,
and
follow
the
winding
of
the
Ohio
,
you
can
perceive
the
village
of
Fulton
along
its
bank
,
some
two
mile
away
,
with
here
and
there
an
elegant
mansion
,
all
stand
out
in
bold
relief
against
the
green
background
of
a
neighbor
ridge
,
and
not
unfrequently
find
themselves
mirror
in
the
river
's
placid
bosom
.
<EOS>
a
view
of
the
delightful
city
of
Cincinnati
be
here
cut
off
by
a
bend
in
the
ridge
and
river
;
but
notwithstanding
,
the
landscape
,
take
as
a
whole
,
be
one
of
the
most
pleasing
that
can
be
find
on
the
globe
.
<EOS>
such
be
an
outline
,
only
,
of
the
scene
which
be
present
to
the
beholder
of
modern
day
;
but
very
different
be
it
sixty
year
ago
,
when
along
the
bank
of
the
river
and
over
the
plain
and
hill
,
instead
of
the
quiet
village
and
its
hum
of
civilization
,
and
the
many
pleasant
farm
under
cultivation
,
and
the
farm
-
house
send
up
in
graceful
wreath
the
smoke
of
their
peaceful
fire
<EOS>
,
there
be
a
vast
,
unbroken
forest
,
inhabit
by
the
barbarous
,
untutored
savage
,
and
the
thousand
wild
beast
of
the
wilderness
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
with
the
early
settlement
of
this
portion
of
the
country
we
have
to
do
,
we
must
leave
the
scene
as
it
now
exist
,
and
go
back
to
the
period
when
the
hardy
pioneer
leave
his
comfortable
and
well
-
protect
home
,
to
venture
hither
,
and
dare
all
the
danger
and
suffer
all
the
privation
of
frontier
life
.
<EOS>
as
early
as
November
,
1788
,
a
party
,
consist
of
some
twenty
person
,
conduct
by
Major
Benjamin
Stites
,
land
at
the
mouth
of
the
Little
Miami
,
and
begin
a
settlement
upon
the
purchase
of
ten
thousand
acre
,
which
the
Major
have
previously
make
from
Judge
Symmes
.
<EOS>
among
this
party
be
many
whose
name
afterward
become
note
in
history
,
and
whose
descendant
still
occupy
prominent
position
in
the
community
whereof
they
be
citizen
.
<EOS>
They
be
the
first
adventurer
into
this
region
of
country
,
and
be
a
month
in
advance
of
the
party
which
land
at
,
and
erect
the
first
log
cabin
on
,
the
present
site
of
Cincinnati
.
<EOS>
on
their
arrival
,
they
immediately
construct
a
log
fort
,
build
several
cabin
or
hut
,
and
then
proceed
to
lay
out
the
town
of
Columbia
into
street
or
lot
,
on
the
plain
we
have
describe
—
believe
at
the
time
,
that
it
would
eventually
become
the
great
capital
of
the
West
.
<EOS>
begin
at
Crawfish
Creek
,
a
small
stream
which
be
to
form
the
north
-
western
boundary
of
the
city
,
ascend
the
Ohio
for
more
than
a
mile
,
and
extend
back
from
the
river
for
three
-
quarter
of
a
mile
,
take
in
a
portion
of
what
be
now
call
Bald
Hill
,
they
lay
out
the
ground
in
street
and
square
.
<EOS>
the
residue
of
the
plain
,
between
this
imaginative
city
and
the
Little
Miami
,
and
for
three
mile
up
this
stream
,
be
cut
up
into
lot
of
four
or
five
acre
each
,
intend
for
the
support
of
the
town
,
when
it
should
come
to
maturity
.
<EOS>
these
lot
have
since
be
divide
by
trench
,
and
so
remain
at
the
present
day
;
and
as
you
view
them
from
Bald
Hill
,
one
cover
with
greensward
,
another
with
a
crop
of
wheat
,
a
third
with
corn
,
a
fourth
with
oats
,
and
so
on
,
the
whole
plain
appear
like
a
many
-
colored
carpet
of
beautiful
square
.
<EOS>
the
first
pioneer
of
the
Miami
Bottom
be
soon
join
by
other
;
and
,
in
the
course
of
a
few
year
,
Columbia
become
quite
a
flourishing
place
,
and
,
for
a
time
,
take
the
lead
of
its
sister
town
,
Cincinnati
and
North
Bend
—
the
last
since
note
as
the
residence
of
General
Harrison
.
<EOS>
at
this
period
,
these
three
village
,
with
the
exception
of
Marietta
,
high
up
the
river
,
be
the
only
white
settlement
in
Ohio
;
and
as
it
be
more
than
suspect
by
the
inhabitant
of
each
,
that
one
of
them
be
destine
to
become
the
great
emporium
of
the
West
,
each
look
upon
the
advancement
of
its
neighbor
with
a
jealous
eye
,
and
seek
,
by
every
means
,
to
push
itself
forward
to
the
grand
desideratum
.
<EOS>
for
a
time
,
Fortune
seem
bent
on
play
her
prank
,
by
now
favor
this
one
,
now
that
,
and
so
alternately
raise
and
depress
the
spirit
of
each
;
but
,
at
last
,
as
the
world
already
know
,
she
yield
the
palm
to
Cincinnati
,
by
establish
there
a
fort
and
garrison
,
which
render
it
,
with
its
natural
advantage
,
a
place
of
great
security
than
either
of
the
other
,
and
,
consequently
,
a
more
desirable
location
for
those
venture
into
the
Western
Wilds
.
<EOS>
about
the
period
when
rivalry
between
the
place
name
be
at
its
height
—
and
when
the
momentous
question
be
pende
,
as
to
which
would
be
the
favor
spot
of
fortune
,
the
Queen
City
of
the
West
—
our
story
open
.
<EOS>
Columbia
,
as
we
say
before
,
have
already
make
rapid
advance
,
and
take
the
lead
of
her
rival
sister
,
in
point
of
business
and
population
.
<EOS>
over
the
broad
plain
,
between
Bald
Hill
and
the
Little
Miami
,
be
now
scatter
some
forty
or
fifty
log
cabin
,
and
at
the
southern
base
of
this
hill
,
on
a
little
knoll
—
where
,
at
the
present
day
,
can
be
see
a
neat
grave
-
yard
,
with
its
marble
and
sand

stone
slab
record
the
name
of
many
who
,
since
then
,
have
go
to
the
shadowy
realm
of
death
—
stand
a
rude
sanctuary
,
the
first
building
erect
solely
to
the
worship
of
God
by
the
pioneer
of
the
Miami
Valley
.
<EOS>
around
this
humble
sanctuary
be
a
grove
of
beautiful
tree
,
in
whose
branch
a
thousand
merry
songster
,
of
all
hue
,
sing
blithely
.
<EOS>
side
by

with
this
place
of
worship
,
on
the
same
knoll
,
amid
the
same
delightful
grove
,
be
erect
a
block
-
house
,
for
the
protection
of
the
inhabitant
in
the
immediate
vicinity
.
<EOS>
Hither
,
on
a
Sabbath
morning
,
when
the
toil
of
the
week
be
over
,
the
villager
of
both
sex
,
and
all
age
,
would
repair
,
to
listen
to
the
word
of
God
,
as
it
fall
from
the
lip
of
the
venerable
Stephen

Gano

mild

noble

benevolent
countenance
,
his
long

white
flow
lock

and
his
solemn

tremulous
voice

as
he

his
eye
to
Heaven
in
supplication
,
or
forcibly
point
out
to
his
hearer
the
way
to
eternal
life
,
make
his
remark
deep
,
grand
and
impressive
.
<EOS>
and
the
more
so
,
it
may
be
,
that
each
feel
himself
to
be
in
the
wilderness
,
surround
by
the
hostile
savage
,
and
know
not
at
what
moment
he
may
be
call
to
his
last
account
,
a
victim
to
the
fatal
rifle
,
or
the
bloody
tomahawk
and
scalping

with

It

fall
warmly
upon

over
the
Miami

pierce
through

down

from
the

,
the
black

bird
,

of
green
and
gold
,
to
the
white
and
plaintive
dove
—
fly
hither
and
thither
,
flutter
among
the
leave
,
and
make
the
perfumed
air
heavy
with
their
melody
.
<EOS>
here
may
be
see
the
bear
,
sit
upon
his
haunch
,
or
lazily
crawl
off
to
seek
his
lair
;
there
the
timid
deer
,
daintily
crop
the
green
herbage
,
or
,
startle
by
some
rude
sound
,
bound
away
with
an
unmatched
grace
and
the
speed
of
the
fly
arrow
.
<EOS>
underneath

occasionally
,
lie
coil
the
wily
copper

head
,
ready
to
strike
his
victim
;

unheeded

perchance
fatal

<EOS>
here
,
too
,
more
cunning
,
more
deadly
than
all
the
dread
beast
or
serpent
of
the
forest
,
may
peradventure
be
find
the
swarthy
savage
,
with
his
murderous
weapon
in
hand
,
crawl
stealthily
and
silently
onward
,
to
execute
his
fell
design
upon
some
innocent
and
unwary
foe
of
his
race
.
<EOS>
but
for
the
danger
everywhere
lurk
in
this
forest
of
beauty
,
it
may
have
seem
a
Paradise
indeed
,
unsurpasse
by
that
primitive
Eden
,
where
man
first
break
the
holy
command
,
and
entail
misery
upon
his
descendant
even
to
the
last
generation
of
time
.
<EOS>
but
notwithstanding
the
peril
which
surround
her
,
which

lie

behind

beneath

<EOS>
beautiful
creature

<EOS>
how
shall
we
describe
her
?
<EOS>
how
convey
,
by
the

,
to
the
optical
sense
,
the
etheriality
,
the
reality
,
the
sunny
brightness
of
the

in
form
divine
before

<EOS>
We
can
give
the
outline
of
form
—
we
can
describe
the
shape
of
her
feature
,
the
color
of
her
hair
and
eye
—
yet
how
shall
we
convey
the
ever

vary
expression
of
her
countenance
—
the
buoyant
,
merry
,
sympathetic
,
versatile
soul

which
animate

the

We

we

it

<EOS>
and
yet
we
will
do
,
to
the
extent
of
our
ability
,
and
let
the
imagination
of
the

supply
the
deficiency

<EOS>
know
then
,
reader
,
that
she
whom
we
have
introduce
to
your
notice
,
be
an
angel
—
not
of
heaven
,
but
of
earth
;
not
pale
and
pensive
,
with
wing
upon
her
shoulder
,
as
we
sometimes
see
the
tenant
of
paradise
represent
—
but
full
of
color
,
life
,
music
,
soul
—
a
bright
being
,
calculate
to
adorn
the
sphere
where
her
lot
be
cast
,
and
yet
,
when
do
,
to
"
shuffle
off
the
mortal

and
be
equally
an

<EOS>
Her

be
sweet

glowing
,
imaginative
seventeen
;
that
age
of
all
other
in
woman
,
the
most
peculiar
and
full
of
strange
sensation
;
when
she
stand
timidly
,
as
it
be
,
between
two
period
—
girlhood
and
womanhood
—
just
pensively
look
back
and
bid
adieu
to
the
one
—
just
brightly
look
before
and
greet
the
other
:
when
,
if
by
chance
she
see
through
the
rose
colored
optic
of
love
,
the
whole
pathway
before
her
seem
strew
with
bright

unfade
flower

and
every

so
new

perfectly
beautiful

and
she

not
that

and
ashe

and

lie
in

<EOS>
bright

rosy
,
buoyant

<EOS>
how
many
thousand
daily
look
back
to

with
a
sigh
,
as
they
think
of
the
hundred
still
unexecuted
plan
lay
out
for
come
time

and
contrast
their
present
condition

those
they

<EOS>
at
seventeen
,
all
be
sweet
indecision
,
uncertainty
and
inexperience

and
life
be
then
to

only
an

where
every
thing
we

no

how
we

it
by

be
a
beautiful
flower

and
flower

each

<EOS>

God

the
cold

unhappy

<EOS>
in
form
she
be
a
beauty
—
light
,
slender
,
graceful
—
full
of
youthful
elasticity
and
vigor
—
with
a
well
developed
bust
—
a
small

plump

dimpled

and
a

<EOS>
so

it

<EOS>
Her

correspond

her
form
—
be
fine
and
comely
,
and
radiant
with
the
glow
of
health
—
but
remarkable
for
nothing
save
expression
.
<EOS>
have
they
be
chissele
in
marble
;
with
the
soul
absent
,
they
would
not
probably
have
even
excite
a

remark

but
with
the
soul
there

that

they
take
the

captive
to
their
charm
,
draw
him
forward
as

hold
him
fast

the

<EOS>
the
predominant
expression
of
her
countenance
be
a
bright
,
roguish
,
girlish
smile
,
which
almost
invariably
hover
around
two
as
pretty
lip
as

and
be
a
type
of
her
nature
and
happy

<EOS>
the

of
her
feature
,
though
somewhat
dark
,
be
smooth
and
transparent
,
where
every
thought
seem
to
make
a

impression
,
as
the
light

upon
the
still
bosom
of
a
glassy
lake

<EOS>
Her
cheek
be
tint
with
the
rose
,
and
slightly
dimpled
;
and
her
mouth
be
set
with

beautiful
row
of

<EOS>
Her

be
dark
and
sparkling

full

and

Her

it

<EOS>
on

she
wear
a
loose
riding
dress

carelessly
arrange

which
,
together
with
her
partially
dishevel

show
that
her

<EOS>
in
her
right
hand
she
hold
the
bridle
rein
of
a
sleek
,
coal

black
steed
,
from
the
saddle
of
which
she
have
apparently
just
dismount

and
by
her
side

loll
as
if
from
hard

and
occasionally
look
up
into
her

crouch
a

Newfoundland

<EOS>
for

moment
she
stand

into
the
limpid

,
in
the
position
we

her

and
then
give
her

a

as

forward
over

she
turn

around

the

while

<EOS>
Kate

for
the
fair

be
none
other
than
our
heroine
)
,
who
be
in
the
act
of

start
and

around
with
a
look
of
alarmed
surprise
;
while
the
horse
prick
up
his
ear
,
and
the
dog
,
with
a
savage
growl
,
spring
in
front
of
his
mistress
,
ready
to
defend
her
with
his
life
.
<EOS>
"Be
not
alarm
,
fair
being

"
continue
the
strange
voice
;
and
at
the
same
instant
,
a
thick
cluster
of
bush
,
grow
on
the
bank
of
the
stream
some
ten
pace
distant
,
be
part
by
a
large
,
sunburnt
,
hairy
hand
,
and
a
tall
,
athletic
,
singular
looking
figure
emerge
therefrom
.
<EOS>
toward
him
the
dog
now
sprang
furiously
;
but
the
next
moment
,
and
ere
he
have
gain
half
way
between
his
mistress
and
the
stranger
,
he
drop
his
tail
between
his
leg
,
and
then
wag
it
in
token
of
recognition
,
trot
up
to
the
other
as
if
to
solicit
a
caress
.
<EOS>
the
new
comer
,
as
we
have
say
,
be
a
singular
looking
being
.
<EOS>
in
stature
he
be
tall
—
be
full
six
foot
—
and
in
person
very
ungainly
.
<EOS>
His
leg
and
arm
,
each
very
long
and
sinewy
,
be
join
to
a
crooked
,
bony
body
.
<EOS>
He
have
tremendous
breadth
of
shoulder
,
from
which
he
taper
down
to
his
foot
,
in
shape
not
unlike
a
wedge
.
<EOS>
His
neck
be
slim
,
but
full
of
large
muscle
and
vein
,
which
seem
to
stand
out
from
it
like
cord
.
<EOS>
His
head
be
rather
large
,
even
for
his
body
,
with
feature
very
coarse
,
and
,
to
one
unacquainted
with
him
,
exceedingly
repulsive
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
big
,
roman
nose
,
sallow
,
sunken
cheek
,
and
a
prominent
chin
,
cover
with
a
thick
,
coarse
,
dirty
,
grizzly
beard
,
which
extend
down
even
to
his
broad
,
hard
,
bronze
bosom
,
and
add
,
to
his
otherwise
unpleasing
exterior
,
an
almost
ferocious
look
.
<EOS>
about
his
eye
,
if
indeed
eye
they
could
be
call
,
he
have
a
remarkable
appearance
;
and
a
stranger
,
at
first
sight
,
would
have
pronounce
him
totally
blind
.
<EOS>
the
lid
of
one
eye
be
close
entirely
;
and
that
of
the
other
so
much
so
,
as
just
to
leave
a
dull
,
lead
-
colored
rim
of
the
low
part
of
the
ball
visible
.
<EOS>
to
add
to
this
disagreeable
appearance
,
the
nearly
close
lid
quiver
continually
,
like
the
leaf
of
the
aspen
;
while
the
ball
of
the
eye
roll
around
in
every
direction
,
as
if
the
owner
be
suffer
mortal
agony
.
<EOS>
above
these
lid
,
across
the
low
portion
of
a
high
,
dark
,
wrinkled
forehead
,
extended
light
,
shaggy
brow
;
and
his
hair
,
which
be
also
light
,
coarse
and
mat
,
come
down
to
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
He
wear
no
hat
;
but
instead
,
a
strip
of
deerskin
,
paint
white
,
on
which
be
some
strange
device
in
black
,
pass
across
his
brow
,
and
around
his
head
,
give
to
him
an
air
of
mystery
.
<EOS>
His
costume
be
as
simple
as
an
Indian
's
.
<EOS>
It
consist
of
a
frock
make
of
deerskin
,
with
the
hair
outside
,
which
be
wear
next
his
body
,
reach
to
his
knee
,
and
be
tighten
around
his
waist
by
a
rough
belt
.
<EOS>
to
this
frock
be
no
sleeve
,
and
,
in
consequence
,
his
brawny
arm
be
entirely
naked
;
neither
do
it
fit
close
around
his
neck
,
but
leave
a
large
portion
of
his
breast
bare
also
.
<EOS>
on
his
foot
be
moccasin
,
which
complete
his
attire
;
and
in
his
belt
,
instead
of
the
usual
weapon
of
that
day
,
be
only
a
long
knife
.
<EOS>
strap
to
his
back
be
a
rude
knapsack
,
in
which
he
carry
jerk
,
a
blanket
,
and
various
implement
.
<EOS>
in
one
hand
(
the
nail
of
which
be
very
long
,
and
the
back
of
which
be
thickly
cover
with
hair
)
<EOS>
he
hold
a
stick
of
witch
-
hazel
,
at
one
end
of
which
be
prong
,
not
unlike
the
tine
of
a
fork
.
<EOS>
to
conclude
,
the
age
of
this
strange
personage
may
have
be
forty
,
or
perhaps
fifty
,
so
difficult
be
it
to
determine
by
his
rough
,
weather
-
beat
countenance
.
<EOS>
His
voice
be
very
deep
,
a
little
inclined
to
the
sepulchral
—
and
his
language
,
ever
good
,
be
often
metaphorical
.
<EOS>
such
be
a
description
of
the
personal
appearance
of
one
of
the
most
remarkable
individual
ever
know
.
<EOS>
who
he
be
,
or
whence
<EOS>
he
come
,
none
could
tell
.
<EOS>
among
the
settler
of
the
early
time
,
he
appear
mysteriously
,
and
as
mysteriously
disappear
;
and
as
he
pretend
to
be
gift
with
second
sight
,
or
a
sight
into
futurity
,
there
be
not
want
those
superstitious
enough
to
believe
him
either
a
supernatural
being
,
or
league
with
the
devil
.
<EOS>
this
feeling
he
take
care
to
foster
,
by
his
act
,
such
as
incantation
,
strange
mutterring
to
himself
,
occasionally
a
wild
manner
,
and
eccentricity
of
various
kind
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
it
be
not
to
be
wonder
at
,
that
,
in
those
time
,
he
should
excite
a
feeling
of
awe
and
superstition
;
for
often
,
when
think
far
distant
,
would
he
make
his
appearance
among
a
group
of
individual
,
who
have
perchance
be
converse
of
him
;
and
this
so
suddenly
,
many
time
,
as
really
to
alarm
them
;
and
then
again
,
ere
any
one
be
aware
how
,
as
suddenly
disappear
.
<EOS>
He
be
sometimes
on
the
pretended
search
for
mine
or
money
,
and
not
unfrequently
do
he
excite
person
to
dig
for
treasure
.
<EOS>
He
tell
fortune
,
occasionally
,
and
occasionally
,
too
,
uttered
prophesie
and
prophetic
warning
.
<EOS>
among
the
white
he
come
and
go
as
he
choose
,
and
also
among
the
savage
,
who
respect
him
as
a
"
great
medicine
"
and
prophet
—
to
injure
whom
would
be
to
offend
the
Great
Spirit
.
<EOS>
by
the
latter
he
be
call
Kitchochobeka
,
or
Great
medicine
;
and
by
the
former
,
Blind
Luther
,
the
Necromancer
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Kate
see
his
person
in
full
,
she
say
,
with
a
gay
laugh
:
"
'
pon
my
word

,
for
once

startle
me
,
for
I

with

and
for
many

afterward
,
the
firm
of
Cooly

<EOS>
during

year
roll
onward
,
and
all
go
smoothly
;
and
of
course
Kate
,
who
give
promise
of
make
a
beautiful
and
intelligent
woman
,
be
not
neglect
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
become
of
a
suitable
age
,
she
be
send
to
school
,
and
every
mean
possible
take
to
secure
her
a
pol
ished
education
—
which
she
,
to
her
praise
be
it
say
,
be
not
slow
to
profit
by
.
<EOS>
at
the
age
of
fourteen
,
she
return
to
her
parent
.
<EOS>
at
fifteen
,
extensive
preparation
be
be
set
on
foot
for
give
a
grand
party
,
that
she
may
make
her
debut
in
society
;
but
ere
the
consummation
of
this
event
,
the
firm
of
Cooly
&
Clarendon
,
to
the
utter
astonishment
of
every
one
,
suddenly
fail
.
<EOS>
this
be
cause
by
the
failure
of
a
large
mercantile
house
in
England
,
with
which
our
Philadelphians
have
a
too
close
business
connection
.
<EOS>
after
have
honorably
discharge
their
debt
,
by
other
property
in
their
posession
,
Clarendon
and
his
partner
find
they
have
<EOS>
but
little
leave
them
;
and
the
former
at
once
resolve
to
take
what
mean
he
have
,
and
set
out
for
the
West
forthwith
<EOS>
;
there
to
embrace
the
more
sure
,
if
not
more
profitable
,
occupation
of
agriculture
.
<EOS>
have
complete
his
arrangement
,
he
bid
adieu
to
his
friend
,
and
depart
with
his
family
,
on
a
journey
of
adventure
to
the
frontier
.
<EOS>
His
first
stop
place
be
Pittsburgh
;
but
not
satisfied
with
the
appearance
of
the
town
,
he
join
a
party
descend
the
river
,
and
land
at
Marietta
still
dissatisfied
,
he
join
the
party
of
Major
Stites
,
and
be
one
of
the
first
who
land
at
the
mouth
of
the
Little
Miami
,
on
the
ground
we
have
before
describe
.
<EOS>
about
half
,
or
perhaps
three
-
fourth
of
a
mile
above
the
mouth
of
the
Miami
,
and
a
hundred
rod
west
of
this
stream
,
be
the
spot
select
by
Clarendon
for
his
residence
.
<EOS>
here
,
soon
after
his
arrival
,
he
erect
a
comfortable
log
-
cabin
,
whither
he
soon
remove
his
wife
and
daughter
,
who
meantime
have
remain
at
Marietta
.
<EOS>
as
must
naturally
be
suppose
,
it
be
anything
but
agreeable
to
people
bring
up
in
the
refined
manner
of
the
Clarendons
,
and
use
all
their
life
to
luxury
,
to
be
change
so
suddenly
from
their
former
enjoyment
,
to
all
the
rough
,
rude
custom
of
pioneer
life
;
and
from
a
state
of
security
and
ease
,
be
transport
to
one
of
danger
and
hardship
.
<EOS>
but
they
have
count
the
cost
beforehand
,
and
prepare
themselves
for
the
bad
;
so
that
the
change
prove
less
severe
than
it
may
otherwise
have
do
.
<EOS>
happiness
be
not
to
be
find
in
external
—
it
lie
within
,
and
depend
altogether
upon
the
mind
—
and
as
the
Clarendons
,
instead
of
fret
and
complaining
of
what
they
could
not
alter
,
strove
to
look
upon
everything
as
happen
for
the
good
,
and
seek
to
be
cheerful
and
to
cheer
each
other
with
word
of
hope
and
encouragement
,
so
they
soon
find
themselves
in
possession
of
enjoyment
beyond
what
at
first
thought
seem
possible
for
them
to
obtain
.
<EOS>
as
for
Kate
,
always
light
-
hearted
and
merry
,
she
be
not
slow
in
finding
mean
to
make
life
pass
gaily
and
agreeably
,
even
in
the
wild
of
the
frontier
.
<EOS>
She
be
exceedingly
fond
of
the
art
eque
train
;
and
that
she
may
not
be
deprive
of
all
the
privilige
to
which
fortune
have
hitherto
entitle
her
,
her
father
purchase
the
steed
,
on
which
the
reader
have
already
see
her
mount
,
and
on
which
it
be
her
delight
to
scour
the
surround
country
,
accompany
by
the
playmate
of
her
youth
,
the
faithful
Bowler
.
<EOS>
Kate
soon
grow
to
like
her
new
home
,
and
to
be
the
favorite
of
every
one
who
know
her
.
<EOS>
Her
frank
,
cheerful
,
merry
disposition
and
win
way
,
win
the
heart
of
all
;
and
there
be
not
a
man
,
woman
or
child
,
in
the
village
of
Columbia
,
but
speak
of
her
in
the
high
term
of
praise
;
nor
one
whose
face
do
not
grow
bright
at
her
coming
.
<EOS>
She
ever
have
a
cheerful
word
and
a
smile
for
all
,
either
young
or
old
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
belle
of
the
village
,
by
general
acclamation
,
and
yet
none
be
envious
.
<EOS>
whatever
Kate
do
be
perfectly
right
;
and
as
to
the
young
man
,
the
great
poltroon
of
them
all
would
have
put
his
life
in
jeopardy
to
gratify
her
slight
wish
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
queen
,
and
reign
supreme
;
and
though
England
's
sovereign
of
modern
day
may
possess
more
power
and
splendor
,
yet
Victoria
,
in
the
height
of
her
popularity
,
never
have
admirer
more
ardent
,
nor
subject
more
devoted
,
than
have
simple
Kate
Clarendon
.
<EOS>
Our
fair
heroine
have
but
<EOS>
one
fault
—
<EOS>
perhaps
this
be
not
a
fault
,
strictly
speak
—
but
if
so
,
it
be
a
fault
of
circumstance
—
one
of
which
<EOS>
almost
every
pretty
woman
be
guilty
—
and
one
which
,
if
not
carry
to
extreme
,
be
certainly
pardonable
:
<EOS>
she
be
,
in
a
measure
,
a
coquette
.
<EOS>
among
the
villager
she
have
many
admirer
,
of
whom
there
be
three
,
genteel
young
man
,
special
suitor
for
her
hand
,
at
the
opening
,
of
our
story
.
<EOS>
for
these
three
,
it
be
rumor
,
Kate
hold
a
preference
over
all
other
;
but
which
one
of
the
three
be
most
admire
by
the
fair
girl
,
none
could
tell
—
not
even
themselves
—
for
to
-
day
it
be
apparently
this
one
,
and
the
next
day
that
,
so
that
each
be
alternately
buoy
up
with
hope
,
and
depress
by
disappointment
.
<EOS>
all
the
gossip
contend
she
have
a
choice
;
but
the
difficulty
lie
in
find
out
the
favor
one
.
<EOS>
whenever
Kate
be
importune
on
the
subject
herself
,
she
invariably
reply
with
a
laugh
,
that
she
like
them
all
,
but
that
her
choice
be
neither
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
not
believe
;
and
those
who
strove
to
keep
a
record
of
every
event
transpiring
in
the
world
of
Columbia
,
be
daily
on
the
look
-
out
for
the
news
of
a
wedding
—
of
behold
the
merry
Kate
catch
in
the
noose
Hymenial
.
<EOS>
the
father
of
Kate
,
be
a
man
some
forty
year
of
age
,
large
and
well
-
proportion
,
with
a
noble
,
manly
,
handsome
countenance
,
and
manner
dignified
and
pleasing
.
<EOS>
among
the
villager
he
be
very
popular
;
and
be
a
man
of
fine
intellect
and
education
,
he
be
look
up
to
,
by
most
,
with
much
deference
and
esteem
.
<EOS>
His
wife
be
a
mild
,
quiet
lady
,
of
a
sweet
,
benevolent
disposition
,
a
few
year
his
junior
,
who
also
stand
high
in
the
estimation
of
the
people
;
so
that
,
among
all
the
villager
,
there
be
,
probably
,
no
family
that
en
joyed
a
great
share
of
genuine
,
heart
-
feel
popularity
,
than
the
Clarendons
.
<EOS>
the
residence
of
the
Clarendons
be
a
well
-
construct
double
cabin
,
with
puncheon
floor
and
clap
-
board
roof
.
<EOS>
Their
furuiture
,
of
course
,
be
of
the
plain
description
;
for
in
those
day
,
and
in
this
section
of
country
,
it
be
impossible
to
have
other
.
<EOS>
They
have
some
good
clothing
,
and
a
number
of
small
article
of
value
,
which
they
have
bring
with
them
from
the
East
.
<EOS>
the
cabin
itself
stand
upon
a
very
slight
knoll
,
and
front
the
west
,
surround
by
a
tall
grove
of
beech
,
sugar
-
tree
,
locust
,
&
c.—with
<EOS>
the
exception
of
an
acre
in
the
rear
,
that
have
be
cut
away
,
and
the
ground
turn
into
a
handsome
garden
of
vegetable
and
flower
.
<EOS>
there
seem
but
one
fault
in
the
whole
arrangement
;
and
that
be
,
that
the
dweliing
be
too
much
expose
—
its
near
neighbor
be
at
the
distance
of
nearly
half
a
mile
.
<EOS>
this
be
remark
upon
by
some
of
the
settler
at
the
time
of
its
erection
;
but
Clarendon
himself
declare
that
he
have
no
apprehension
,
and
the
subject
be
never
again
refer
to
.
<EOS>
Time
roll
on
smoothly
,
and
the
Clarendons
,
at
the
date
of
our
story
,
find
themselves
once
more
in
rather
prosperous
circumstance
.
<EOS>
but
as
it
be
with
Kate
we
have
for
<EOS>
the
present
especially
to
do
,
we
will
return
to
her
forthwith
.

<EOS>
upon
the
youthful
mind
of
Kate
,
the
word
of
the
Necromancer
make
a
deep
impression
;
and
for
several
day
after
their
interview
,
it
be
notice
by
her
friend
,
with
some
concern
,
that
,
contrary
to
her
usual
manner
,
she
appear
sad
,
thoughtful
,
and
even
abstract
.
<EOS>
but
as
it
be
know
she
have
receive
a
severe
fright
from
the
panther
,
the
cause
be
attribute
to
this
,
and
every
one
look
to
see
it
gradually
wear
off
,
and
behold
her
again
bright
with
her
own
cheerful
,
happy
smile
.
<EOS>
wear
off
the
sadness
certainly
do
;
and
a
week
from
the
event
we
have
chronicle
,
Kate
appear
the
same
smiling
,
joyous
be
as
before
.
<EOS>
about
this
time
,
the
young
people
of
Columbia
decide
on
have
a
ball
—
which
,
if
it
could
not
rival
in
splendor
some
in
the
old
settlement
,
may
,
at
least
,
in
heart
-
feel
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
an
appropriate
place
be
select
,
a
fiddler

and
every
preparation
think
necessary
for
the
come

speedily

on

<EOS>
the
building
choose
for
the
purpose
,
be
a
new
double
cabin
,
which
have
just
be
complete
,
and
only
wait
this
kind
of
christening
,
as
some
of
them
term

for
the
young

who

with

collect
;
and
the
wall
and
ceiling
be
decorate
with
hanging
of
green
,
and
with
beautiful

and

.
<EOS>
in
one
apartment
a
long
table
be
spread
,
and
cover
with
such
delicacy
as
the

then
afford
;
and
many

there
be
(

,
which

would
be

great

of

(

somewhat

not

the

of
royalty
,
could
have
excite
one
tithe
of
the
pride
in
the
bosom

"The
<EOS>
belle
of
the
ball
be

of
course
,
to
be
our
youthful
Kate

as
she

there
be

young

who
lay

gallant
for
the

there
be

as
a
natural
consequence
,
some
peculiar
sensation

in
the
breast
of

in
regard
to
which
should
be
the
favor

<EOS>
unwilling
to
take
an
undue
advantage
of
each
other
,
they
meet
to
decide
the
matter
by
themselves

<EOS>
among
other
thing

one
propose
that
they
should
draw
lot
for
the
preference
;
another
,
that
they
should
run
a
race
for
it
;
and
the
third
and
last
,
that
they
should
all
go
in
a
body
together
,
and
allow
her
to
make
her
own
selection
.
<EOS>
this
last
proposition
be
finally
agree
to
,
as
the
point
at
issue
would
,
in
this
way
,
be
decide
by
the
girl
herself
;
and
,
consequently
,
each
would
know
which
be
the
most
favored
suitor
of
the
three
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
the
next
morning
,
which
be
a
beautiful
one
indeed
,
and
the
third
precede
the
gala
night
,
our
three
lover
mount
themselves
on
fine
horse
,
and
together
ride
over
the
plain
toward
the
residence
of
their
fair
umpire
,
to
have
the
pende
question
decide
by
her
own
sweet
lip
and
voice
—
each
to
be
make
happy

the
case
may

Kate

upon
the
lofty

and
an

He

of
a
respectable
citizen
of

and
be

Albert
Danvers

<EOS>
"We
never

the
second
,
a
square
-
build
,
robust
,
jolly
-
face
young
man
of
nineteen
,
whose
countenance
indicate
health
and
happiness
.
<EOS>
He
be
also
the
son
of
a
settler
,
and
be
call
Orville
Danbury
.
<EOS>
the
third
member
of
the
party
be
old
,
more
marked
in
his
apperance
than
either
of
the
other
,
and
consequently
will
require
a
more
minute
description
.
<EOS>
His
age
be
about
twenty
-
three
,
and
his
figure
slim
and
tall
.
<EOS>
His
feature
be
rather
effeminate
than
manly
,
with
a
pale
,
sallow
complexion
,
and
be
expressive
of
habitual
thought
on
gloomy
subject
.
<EOS>
He
have
black
,
sink
,
pierce
eye
,
a
straight
,
well
-
form
nose
,
a
rather
pretty
mouth
,
and
a
round
and
prominent
chin
.
<EOS>
His
lip
be
thin
and
habitually
compress
;
and
when
he
smile
,
which
he
do
but
seldom
,
and
then
as
if
by
an
effort
,
there
lurk
around
them
an
expression
both
sensual
and
sinister
.
<EOS>
He
have
little
,
very
little
beard
—
so
that
his
face
be
as
smooth
almost
as
a
lady
's
.
<EOS>
His
forehead
be
high
,
but
not
of
a
prepossessing
cast
,
and
be
mar
by
deep
furrow
,
as
if
the
mind
be
continually
employ
on
some
difficult
theme
.
<EOS>
His
hair
be
black
and
curly
;
and
what
be
somewhat
rare
in
that
part
of
the
country
at
that
day
,
be
keep
well
oil
and
brush
.
<EOS>
His
suit
of
fine
broad
-
cloth
,
neatly
fit
to
his
person
,
contrast
forcibly
with
the
coarse
,
loose
,
home
-
make
,
woolmixed
grey
of
his
companion
.
<EOS>
the
origin
of
Rashton
Moody
(
so
he
term
himself
)
be
not
definitely
known
to
any
of
the
villager
.
<EOS>
about
a
year
previous
to
the
date
of
our
story
,
he
make
his
appearance
in
Columbia
,
bear
a
pack
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
with
him
bring
the
implement
of
a
surveyor
.
<EOS>
as
a
person
of
his
profession
happen
to
be
want
at
the
time
,
he
be
immediately
give
employment
,
and
have
remain
in
the
vicinity
ever
since
.
<EOS>
His
dress
,
occupation
,
and
finished
manner
,
at
once
make
him
the
beau
ideal
of
all
the
young
lady
of
the
village
,
to
whom
his
slight
expression
be
an
oracle
of
wisdom
;
and
in
whose
pale
,
thoughtful
,
half
-
melancholy
countenance
,
they
see
enough
to
excite
their
sympathy
,
together
with
a
world
of
romance
;
and
consequently
,
of
all
their
imagining
,
he
be
the
hero
.
<EOS>
but
if
all
fancy
him
,
it
be
evident
that
he
do
not
reciprocate
;
for
after
a
time
,
he
gradually
withdraw
his
company
from
all
save
Kate
Clarendon
;
and
if
there
chance
to
be
a
gathering
where
she
be
not
expect
to
be
present
,
Rashton
Moody
be
invariably
absent
.
<EOS>
have
Kate
not
be
a
great
favorite
with
all
,
this
marked
expression
of
regard
for
her
alone
,
from
one
so
universally
popular
,
must
have
make
her
many
enemy
among
her
own
sex
.
<EOS>
now
,
as
often
happen
in
such
case
,
the
individual
himself
,
and
the
preference
show
by
him
for
her
company
,
be
less
agreeable
to
Kate
,
than
they
would
have
be
to
almost
any
other
unmarried
lady
in
Columbia
.
<EOS>
but
Kate
,
as
we
have
say
,
be
a
little
inclined
to
be
coquettish
;
so
that
whatever
may
be
her
real
feeling
<EOS>
,
they
be
conceal
by
a
dissemblance
that
completely
deceive
all
;
and
,
moreover
,
it
be
perfectly
natural
that
one
of
her
turn
of
mind
should
feel
flatter
by
the
attention
of
a
personage
so
much
seek
for
by
other
,
whether
she
care
for
him
herself
or
not
.
<EOS>
have
Kate
express
the
real
sentiment
of
her
heart
,
she
would
have
say
that
she
like
danver
,
could
endure
Danbury
,
but
that
the
company
of
Moody
be
really
disagreeable
to
her
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
this
,
however
,
there
be
,
to
her
,
rare
sport
in
have
what
she
term
three
devoted
lover
of
respectability
;
and
so
she
encourage
all
collectively
,
but
manage
to
evade
commit
herself
with
any
individually
.
<EOS>
Her
plan
be
adopt
more
for
her
own
amusement
,
doubtless
,
than
for
any
other
purpose
.
<EOS>
Her
delight
be
in
draw
them
on
to
a
certain
point
,
and
<EOS>
then
,
just
as
the
conversation
be
become
somewhat
serious
,
adroitly
turn
it
by
some
light
remark
foreign
to
the
subject
.
<EOS>
as
she
care
less
for
Moody
than
either
of
the
other
,
so
she
fear
him
the
more
;
for
there
be
something
about
him
,
that
,
in
spite
of
herself
,
always
make
her
gloomy
,
and
chill
all
the
warm
impulse
of
her
joyous
heart
.
<EOS>
Could
she
with
propriety
have
dismiss
him
,
doubtless
she
would
have
do
so
;
but
to
do
this
,
while
receive
the
attention
of
other
,
would
have
call
for
an
explanation
,
and
she
have
none
suitable
to
give
.
<EOS>
neither
would
it
do
,
as
she
look
upon
the
matter
,
to
wound
his
feeling
,
by
treat
him
less
civilly
than
his
rival
.
<EOS>
thus
matter
stand
between
the
various
party
,
at
the
time
we
have
choose
to
introduce
them
to
the
reader
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
Sir
Knight
of
the
Black
Armor
,
"
say
Kate
,
address
Moody
,
in
a
tone
of
innocent
raillery
,
after
have
wait
a
sufficient
time
for
him
to
begin
the
conversation
,
"
how
be
it
that
your
lip
be
more
seal
than
your
companion
in
arm
of
the
Hodden
Grey?""True
love
be
ever
silent
,
"
return
Moody
,
laconically
,
fix
his
dark
,
pierce
eye
upon
Kate
,
in
a
manner
so
earnest
,
as
to
draw
a
blush
to
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
"Nay
,
"
say
Kate
,
rallying
,
"
that
be
not
to
the
point

sirrah
!
<EOS>
We
be
not
talk
of

<EOS>
""only

Moody

<EOS>
"Nay

I
deny

<EOS>
""I

much

sigh
Moody
.
<EOS>
"Faith
<EOS>
,
but
you
be
become
sentimental

"
reply
Kate
,
force
out
a
ringing
laugh
,
to
cover
the
embarrassment
she
feel
from
a
remark
so
pointed
.
<EOS>
"
come
,
my
gallant
cavalier

"
she
add
to
all
,
"
will
you
not

,
and
honor
the
dwelling
of

for

as
to
that

"
reply
the
first
speaker
,
Albert
Danvers

I
can
say

for

that
nothing

think
the
errand

<EOS>
as

not

leave
what
they

the

forward

for
half
an

sinister

around

mount

but
although
she
strictly
comply

her
agreement

in
accompany
him
to
the
ball
,
yet
it
be
clearly
evident
to
Moody
,
by
her
manner

that
his
company
be
not
so
agreeable
to

only
result

monosyllable

in

both
occupy
with
thought
of
their

those
of
Moody

not

imaginable

the

turn
out

Kate

<EOS>
She
dance
,
it
be
true

be
lively

gay

those
who
observe
her
narrowly
—
and
there
be
many
who
do
,
among

Danvers
and
Danbury

perceive
that
the
feeling

be
sadly

<EOS>
some
,
who
notice
it
,
even
go
so
far
as
to
question
her
on
the
subject
;
but
she
even
reply
,
with
a
force
laugh
,
that
her
look
must
belie
her
,
as
she
never
feel
more
cheerful
in
her
life

<EOS>
moody
,
too
,
be
more
cold
and
distant

rarely
speak
to
any

and
then
very
briefly
;
seldom
smile
,
and
altogether
seem
in
an
ill

the

the
bound

as
they
whirl
over

hear
the

and
the

and
peradventure
the
gay
song
,
from
such
as

would

on
the

Ichabod

,
who
be
in
his
way
something
of
a
gossip

be
stir
betime
,
that
he
may

with
his
wonderful
news
among
the
villager

<EOS>
with
a
mysterious
air
,
and
sundry
addition
and
embellishment
,
where
he
think
them
necessary
,
he
tell
his
tale
to
a
gape
crowd
,
who

with
feeling
of
indignation
too
deep
for
word
,
at
once
proceeede
to
the
residence
of
Moody
,
with
the
intention
of
punish
him

to
his
desert
.
<EOS>
have
they
find
him
,
under
the
excitement
they
be
then
labor
,
it
be
more
than
propable
<EOS>
the
affair
would
have
have
a
tragical
termination
;
but
he
be
go
,
and
no
one
know
whither
,
so
that
pursuit
be
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
the
whole
affair
create
a
great
sensation
,
and
be
a
common
topic
for
several
day
.
<EOS>
as
a
story
loose
nothing
by
be
repeat
,
particularly
when
it
border
on
the
marvelous
,
so
the
tale
in
question
,
as
it
go
from
one
to
another
,
become
distorted
to
a
wonderful
degree
—
until
at
last
an
old
lady
,
in
tell
it
for
the
twentieth
time
,
ac
tually
vouched
for
the
truth
of
the
assertion
,
that
Moody
have
place
the
knife
against
the
heart
of
Kate
,
and
be
press
with
all
his
strength
upon
the
handle
,
without
make
the
least
impression
,
when
a
dark
cloud
suddenly
envelop
him
,
and
Luther
appear
in
a
flame
of
fire
,
and
seize
and
bear
him
off
,
amid
terrible
thundering
,
and
the
most
awful
shriek
of
woe
that
mortal
ear
ever
hear
.
<EOS>
as
for
Kate
herself
,
her
gay
spirit
seem
suddenly
to
have
leave
her
.
<EOS>
She
grow
reserve
and
silent
,
and
withal
,
not
a
little
melancholy
.
<EOS>
in
vain
her
friend
—
who
after
the
event
we
have
detail
,
flock
to
see
her
in
number
—
try
to
enliven
her
by
their
conversation
,
and
frequent
sally
of
wit
.
<EOS>
She
say
little
to
any
,
and
if
she
smile
at
all
,
it
be
one
of
those
wan
smile
,
which
,
contrast
as
it
do
so
forcibly
with
her
former
ringing
laugh
,
be
really
painful
to
observe
.
<EOS>
from
a
laugh
,
frolicsome
,
light
-
hearted
girl
,
she
seem
change
to
a
serious
,
thoughtful
woman
;
and
all
so
suddenly
,
as
to
make
it
rather
marvelous
.
<EOS>
It
be
evident
that
something
prey
upon
her
mind
,
and
depress
her
spirit
,
and
many
be
the
conjecture
concern
it
.
<EOS>
some
hint
that
she
love
Moody
,
and
that
his
base
action
have
destroy
her
confidence
in
him
;
and
though
she
have
tear
him
forever
from
her
heart
,
yet
there
have
be
leave
an
ache
void
,
from
which
time
alone
could
relieve
her
.
<EOS>
other
say
it
be
owe
to
the
fright
she
have
receive
,
and
that
in
a
few
day
she
would
be
herself
again
.
<EOS>
but
these
be
conjecture
only
,
for
Kate
keep
her
secret
close
lock
in
her
own
breast
;
and
when
question
on
the
matter
,
she
ever
manage
to
answer
in
such
a
way
that
none
be
make
the
wise
for
it
.
<EOS>
thus
matter
run
along
for
several
week
,
and
flowery
spring
be
just
take
leave
of
the
year
,
to
give
bright
summer
her
accustomed
place
and
reign
over
the
advance
golden
harvest
.
<EOS>
since
that
eventful
night
,
Rashton
Moody
have
never
be
see
nor
hear
of
by
any
of
the
villager
;
and
the
circumstance
connect
with
his
disappearance
,
have
be
discuss
time
and
again
,
be
now
become
wear
out
topic
,
of
but
<EOS>
little
interest
to
any
.
<EOS>
luther
,
too
,
have
not
since
make
his
appearance
,
and
it
be
doubt
by
some
that
he
ever
would
.
<EOS>
danver
and
Danbury
have
both
call
upon
Kate
,
separately
,
some
two
or
three
time
;
but
find
their
reception
very
cold
,
have
at
last
give
up
their
visit
,
in
despair
of
ever
be
able
to
win
her
affection
.
<EOS>
It
be
about
this
time
,
say
some
six
week
from
the
night
of
the
ball
,
that
Kate
Clarendon
and
her
mother
be
seat
a
little
apart
,
in
their
own
dwelling
,
engage
upon
some
coarse
sewing
.
<EOS>
the
night
—
for
it
be
an
early
hour
in
the
evening
—
be
very
dark
,
and
now
and
then
a
flash
of
lightning
,
follow
by
the
rumble
sound
of
distant
thunder
,
together
with
a
cool
damp
breeze
,
which
blow
steadily
from
the
west
,
announce
that
a
shower
be
fast
approach
.
<EOS>
for
some
time
mother
and
daughter
keep
silence
—
both
intently
occupy
with
the
work
in
their
hand
—
when
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
,
that
seem
to
crinkle
and
play
upon
their
needle
,
make
them
involuntarily
start
together
and
utter
exclamation
of
surprise
.

"How
<EOS>
near

Mrs.

I

""O

Kate

I

I
do
not

it
be
dangerous

in
some
trepidation

I
fear

with

that
something

serious
nature

<EOS>
perhaps
he
have
be
kill
,

capture
by
the

I

one

two
have
lately
be
see
prowl

""God
forbid

<EOS>
cry
Kate

cover
her

at
the
moment
the
word
of
the
Necromancer
seem
ring
in
her
ear

<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
where
have
you

<EOS>
inquire
Mrs.

"Why
,
<EOS>
ye
see
,
we
both
on
us
start
out
for
to
hunt
some
deer

answer
the
gardener
,
"

a
long
,
dry
chase
we
have
on't
<EOS>
;
for
some
how
the
pesky
critter
seem
to
know
we
be
arter
'em
,

so
keep
out
o
'
the
way

<EOS>
I
reckon
we
go
much
as
five
mile
up
the
Miami
,
and
do
not
see
one
—
though
we
seed
some
fresh
track
occasionally
—
and
<EOS>
so
we
conclude
we
would
give
in
and
come
home
.
<EOS>
when
we
get
most
home
,
say
half
a
mile
off
,
we
somehow
stumble
on
to
one
that
have
not
keep
quite
so
good
look
-
out
as
the
rest
,
and
him
I
shoot
straightway
.
<EOS>
this
start
up
another
,
that
look
like
he
may
be
shoot
,
if
a
body
could
get
near
enough

so
I
tell
Mr.

,
that
if
he
would
see
that
home
,
I
would
try
my
leg
and
ammunition
for
another
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
would
,

off
I
sot
,
and
a
confound
long
chase
I
have
,
and
do
not
catch
it
at
last
—
the
scamp
of
a
critter
that
it
be
!

when
I
get
start
come
home

I
find
it
gitte
right
dark

I
'
specte
he
would
be
here

have
some
on't
cook
when
I
get
here
sartin

"By
<EOS>
this

as
,
in

resolve
on

so
all
that

to
the
contrary

"Come

quick
now
,

in

few
minute

through
the
wood
,
close
upon
the
heel
of
her
serve
man
,
who
bear
in
one
hand
a
rifle
,
and
in
the
other
a
light
lantern

<EOS>
the
course
of
our
friend
from
the
cottage
be
nearly
due
east
;
and
after
continue
for
some
time
without
speak
,
through
thick
tangle
of
brush
,
that
saturate
them
as
they
pass
,
and
over
large
fall
tree
,
that
have
be
uproot
,
or
break
and
cast
down
by
the
storm
—
they
reach
the
Miami
,
whose
now
dark
,
swollen
and
turbulent
water
come
rush
past
with
a
cheerless
,
gloomy
sound
,
which
strike
upon
the
ear
like
the
hollow
rattling
of
earth
upon
a
coffin
.
<EOS>

upon

after
vainly
try
to
persuade
Kate
to
remain
or
return
,
as
siste
her
into
it
,
and
shove
across
—
not
,
however
,
without
some
risk
,
as
the
current
,
be
strong
,
rapidly
bear
them
down
several
yard
,
before
they
be
able
to
effect
a
landing
.
<EOS>
reach
the
other
bank
at
length
in
safety
,
Kate
give
another
call
to
Bowler
,
which
,
to
her
gratification
,

almost
immediately

<EOS>
a
minute
after
,
the
dog
come
bound
up
to

,
whine
piteously
,
and
then
immediately
dart
away
,
and
up
the
hill

somewhat
steep
above

<EOS>
"Oh

"
exclaim
Kate
,

in
an
agony
of

almost
unbearable
,

fast
gait

<EOS>
They
have

about
a
hundred
yard
further
,
when
they
hear
a
deep
groan
,
which
make
the
blood
of
both
run
coldly
through
their
vein
;
and
Kate
place
her
hand
upon
her
heart
,
to
still
its
wild
throbbing
,
feel
a
sickening
dizziness
come
over
her
,
that
almost
take
away
the
power
of

<EOS>
"I

and

<EOS>
and
even
do
we

what
benefit
would
accrue
to
the

<EOS>
who
could
realize

but
such
as

in
similar
circumstance

and
for
such

no

for

<EOS>
Suffice

flock
to
the
house
of

to
behold
the
deceased
,
and
condole
with
the
living
.
<EOS>
as
Clarendon
come
to
his
death
in
a
manner
so
singular
,
it
be
judge
expedient
to
hold
an
inquest
over
the
body

that

his
death
by
reason
of
gash

<EOS>
Ernest

young

,
who
have
remain
over
night
at
the
cottage
,
be
next
call
upon
to
state
what
he
know
in
regard
to
the
affair
,
and
how
he
come
to
be
find
with
the
deceased
,
so
far
from
any
habitation
,
alone
,
at
such
a
time
of
night
,
and
under
circumstance
so
calculated
to
render
him
an
object
of
suspicion
.
<EOS>
the
jury
have
now
form
a
circle
around
the
deceased
,
in
the
adjoin
apartment
or
cabin
,
and
as
the
spokesman
conclude
,
each
turn
his
face
toward
Ernest

who
,
with
some
five
or
six
other
spectator
,
be
stand
just
without
the
ring
.
<EOS>
on
hear
the
question
put
,
he
start
,
a
deep
flush
mantle
his
feature
,
and
without
ado
,
he
step
boldly
within
the
circle
,
and
with
one
hand
gently
touch
the
dead
.
<EOS>
He

off
by
his
close

fitting
uniform
.
<EOS>
His
feature
be
comely
and
very
expressive
;
and
there
be
a
nobility
in
his
high
,
broad
forehead
,
surmount
by
dark
brown
curl
,
and
in
his
full
black
eye
,
which
forbid
the
idea
that
he
could
be
guilty
of
a
mean
or
base
action
.
<EOS>
"Gentlemen
<EOS>
,
"
he
say
,
calmly
,
and
with
dignity
,
move
his
eye
slowly
around
the
circle
,
and
rest
them
for
a
moment
on
each
member
:
<EOS>
"
gentleman
,
you
have
hear
me
call
upon
to
state
what
I
know
in
regard
to
this
unfortunate
affair

in
a
manner
calculate
to
leave
upon
your
mind
the
impression
that
my
knowledge
be
not
honestly
and
honorably

.
<EOS>
what
object
the
speaker
have
in
address
me
in
the
way
he
do
,
I
know
not
,
but
shall
call
upon
him
to
explain
hereafter
;
and
I
trust
his
answer
will
be
satisfactory
:
<EOS>
otherwise
(
here
he
gracefully
and
lightly
touch
the
hilt
of
his
sword
with
his
right
hand
,
and
fix
his
eye
steadily
upon
the
one
allude
to
,
who
quail
before
his
glance
)
,
there
be
,
thank
fortune

<EOS>
an
honorable
way
of
settle
all
matter
of
a
similar
nature
.
<EOS>
"I
shall
now
proceed
,
"
he
continue
,
"
to
state
the
fact
,
briefly
as
possible
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
as
you
will
perceive
by
my
uniform
,
I
be
in
the
service
of
the
Government
.
<EOS>
I
hold
a
lieutenant
's
commission
,
and
be
quarter
at
Cincinnati
.
<EOS>
some
few
night
since
,
word
be
bring
to
my
command
officer
,
that
a
body
of
Indians
be
prowl
about
the
vicinity
,
and
that
,
unless
they
be
see
to
in
time
,
serious
result
would
be
likely
to
follow
.
<EOS>
upon
this
,
I
be
immediately
order
to
head
a
detachment
of
ten
pick
man
,
and
scour
the
surround
country
,
and
if
I
find
no
Indians
,
to
divide
and
send
my
man
out
separately
as
scout
.
<EOS>
to
make
a
long
story
short
,
my
man
be
send
out
in
every
direction
,
one
after
another
,
until
I
be
leave
entirely
alone
.
<EOS>
yesterday
,
while
scout
myself
,
I
reach
and
cross
the
Little
Miami
,
and
be
on
my
return
last
evening
to
the
garrison
,
when
,
find
myself
belate
,
and
that
a
severe
storm
be
approach
,
I
ascend
a
tree
to
await
the
appearance
of
a
clear
sky
.
<EOS>
while
in
the
tree
,
I
several
time
fancy
I
hear
a
groan
,
but
think
I
have
most
probably
mistake
the
wailing
of
the
storm
,
which
be
then
rage
with
fury
,
for
a
human
voice
.
<EOS>
when
the
storm
begin
to
die
away
,
I
descend
to
the
ground
,
for
the
purpose
of
resume
my
journey
.
<EOS>
scarcely
have
I
do
so
,
when
I
hear
the
mournful
howl
of
a
dog
near
by
.
<EOS>
think
there
must
be
something
wrong
,
I
hasten
in
the
direction
<EOS>
whence
the
noise
proceed
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
go
far
,
when
I
hear
a
distant
call
.
<EOS>
immediately
after
,
the
dog
,
with
a
yelp
,
bound
away
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
moment
,
a
deep
groan
sound
in
my
ear
;
and
press
forward
,
I
be
not
long
in
find
the
cause
in
the
person
of
the
deceased
,
who
be
lie
upon
his
side
,
under
a
large
tree
,
and
bleed
profusely
from
a
couple
of
wound
,
locate
as
you
perceive
.
<EOS>
I
question
him
as
to
what
have
occur
,
but
he
be
too
far
go
to
answer
.
<EOS>
I
endeavor
to
staunch
the
blood
,
but
do
not
succeed
in
do
much
good
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
the
dog
return
;
and
shortly
after
,
I
see
a
light
in
the
distance
,
apparently
move
toward
me
.
<EOS>
steadily
the
light
approach
,
and
at
length
I
espy
a
couple
of
figure
with
it
.
<EOS>
from
my
position
,
I
be
afterward
enable
to
keep
them
in
view
,
until
near
enough
to
make
them
hear
my
voice
,
when
I
urge
them
to
hasten
forward
,
while
I
at
once
spring
back
to
the
deceased
.
<EOS>
while
bend
over
the
wounded
man
,
I
hear
a
shriek
,
and
look
around
,
be
surprised
to
find
a
beautiful
female
near
me
,
on
the
ground
,
in
a
swooning
state
.
<EOS>
I
hasten
to
raise
her
in
my
arm
,
and
while
engage
in
restore
her
to
consciousness
,
the
unfortunate
man
breathe
his
last
.
<EOS>
on
his
breast
be
find
this
paper
,
which
have
peruse
,
and
take
the
testimony
of
Miss
Clarendon
and
her
serving
-
man
,
I
trust
,
gentleman
,
you
will
fully
exonerate
me
from
even
a
suspicion
of
be
in
any
manner
concern
in
the
death
of
him
now
lie
before
you
.
"As
<EOS>
Clifton
conclude
,
he
present
to
the
foreman
of
the
jury
the
paper
allude
to
,
which
the
reader
will
recollect
as
the
one
bear
the
signature
of
Rashton
Moody

<EOS>
no
little
excitement
be
create
on
read
this

for
all
know
Moody
well

also
the
cause

Clarendon

<EOS>
Kate
and
Ichabod
be

separately

as
their
testimony
only
corroborate
Clifton
's
,
the
matter
be
soon
decide
,
and
<EOS>
the
verdict
render
—
that
George
Clarendon
come
to
his
death
by
mean
of
a
knife
,
or
some
other
sharp
instrument
,
in
the
hand
of
Rashton
Moody
,
whom
the
jury
in
consequence
consider
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
.
<EOS>
the
funeral
of
Clarendon
take
place
on
the
follow
day
,
and
be
attend
by
a
large
concourse
of
citizen

of
both
sex

all
of
whom
appear
to
sympathize
deeply
with
the
afflict
family
.
<EOS>
the
funeral
service
be
uncommonly
solemn
and
impressive
,
and
when
the
speaker
conclude
,
scarcely
a
dry
eye
could
be
find
in
the
whole
assemblage
.
<EOS>
a
long
procession
attend
the
corpse
to
its
last
earthly
resting
place

be
the
quiet
little
graveyard

the
knoll
,
where
stand
the
sanctuary
,
of
which
mention
be
make
in
the
opening
chapter
of
this
history
.
<EOS>
as
the
soft
earth
fall
with
a
hollow
,
rattle
sound
upon
the
coffin
,
assure
the
living
that
the
last
parting
between
them
and
the
dead
have
really
take
place
,
not
a
dry
eye
could
be

among
the
group
that
now

around
the
open
grave

<EOS>
as
for
Kate
and
her
mother
,
their
sobs
and
lamentation
be
truly

and
it
almost
require

<EOS>
It
be
one
of
the

of
Divine
Providence
that
the
mind
can
be
heal
as
well
as
the
body
—
otherwise
what
wretched

should
we

who
,
among
the
most
heaven

of
us
all
<EOS>
,
hath
not
lose
a
friend
—
a
near
and
dear
relative
—
and
feel
his
soul
oppress
by
a
weight
of
woe
,
that
then
seem
destine
never
to
be
remove
;
but
which
time
have
gradually
lighten
,
until
the
heart
have
leap
as
free
and
joyous
as
in
the
noon
-
tide
of
its
prosperity
.
<EOS>
It
be
hard
to
part
from
those
we
love
—
even
when
we
expect
to
behold
them
again
in
life
—
for
the
separation
leave
an
ache
void
,
that
nothing
for
the
time
can
fill
—
<EOS>
and
of
course
it
must
be
proportionately
hard
to
part
from
those
we
love
,
know
that
we
shall
behold
them
no
more
,
until
we
ourselves
shall
have
put
off
the
mortal
and
put
on
immortality
.
<EOS>
but
,
notwithstanding
this
,
we
should
ever
strive
to
avoid
be
too
much
cast
down
;
should
buoy
ourselves
up
with
the
reflection
,
that
all
be
bear
to
die
;
and
that
they
who
have
pass
the
fatal
barrier
have
already
do
with
a
world
of
trouble
,
and
enter
upon
a
new
,
and
,
we
trust
,
more
happy
existence
—
where
we
,
when
we
have
play
our
part
on
the
stage
of
life
,
shall
join
them
to
separate
no
more
forever
.
<EOS>
let
us
philosophize
that
death
be
but
a
sleep
,
and
eternity
a
delightful
dream
,
and
that
the
sooner
our
spirit
leave
this
troublesome
tenement
,
fitly
prepared
for
the
change
,
the
sooner
we
shall
be
in
Heaven
.
<EOS>
some
mind
be
so
constituted
,
that
the
least
trouble
seem
sufficient
to
overthrow
them
,
and
great
trouble
drive
them
nearly
distract
;
and
yet
after
a
little
,
they
gradually
become
tranquil
,
sorrow
pass
away
,
and
they
appear
as
gay
and
light
-
hearted
as
before
:
while
,
on
the
other
hand
,
we
find
other
,
who
appear
calm
amid
the
less
ill
,
and
amid
the
great
make
little
or
no
complaint
,
and
yet
be
secretly
bear
down
to
the
grave
by
the
affliction
they
scarce
seem
to
lament
.
<EOS>
something
of
both
these
nature
could
be
find
in
Kate
and
her
mother
.
<EOS>
as
time
wear
on
,
the
former
gradually
become
more
and
more
herself
;
while
the
latter
appear
to
pine
away
in
secret
,
as
though
some
inward
disease
be
prey
upon
her
vital
.
<EOS>
from
the
moment
she
receive
the
news
of
her
husband
's
death
,
Mrs.
Clarendon
be
never
know
to
smile
;
and
though
at
first
she
make
great
lamentation
over
him
,
yet
this
soon
settle
into
a
quiet
,
silent
melancholy
,
that
forebode
,
ere
long
,
either
death
or
insanity
.
<EOS>
three
month
roll
away
,
and
the
mother
of
Kate
be
find
to
be
in
a
decline
of
health
.
<EOS>
a
cold
that
she
have
catch
some
two
month
before
,
have
settle
on
her
lung
,
which
,
together
with
grief
for
the
loss
of
her
husband
,
be
now
make
those
rapid
stride
with
her
constitution
,
that
always
awaken
fear
of
the
most
painful
nature
.
<EOS>
She
cough
a
good
deal
—
her
voice
become
change
—
more
hoarse
and
hollow
—
and
there
be
,
at
time
,
a
wax
-
like
transparency
about
her
skin
,
and
a
hectic
flush
on
her
cheek
,
that
tell
,
with
unmistakable
certainty
,
of
the
silent
work
of
death
go
on
within
.
<EOS>
Kate
notice
the
progress
of
the
fell
destroyer
with
less
alarm
than
may
have
be
suppose
.
<EOS>
doubtless
she
do
not
realize
how
much
have
already
be
do
,
and
look
forward
to
year
of
companionship
with
her
mother
.
<EOS>
but
not
so
Mrs.
Clarendon
herself
.
<EOS>
unlike
many
who
have
that
flattering
disease
,
consumption
,
fasten
upon
them
,
she
see
and
feel
her
danger
;
and
,
like
the
wise
one
of
old
,
deem
it
expedient
to
have
her
lamp
trim
and
burn
,
ready
for
the
coming
of
the
bridegroom
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
one
bright
summer
's
day
toward
the
latter
part
of
August
,
she
bid
Kate
seat
herself
by
her
side
,
that
they
may
converse
on
a
subject
of
no
little
moment
to
both
.
<EOS>
"It
<EOS>

"
observe
Mrs.
Clarendon
,
lay
her
thin
,
transparent
hand
on
the
white
and
plump
one
of
Kate
,
thereby
display
a
painful
contrast
between
sickness
and
health
:

since
that
terrible
night

your

as
I

I
be
not

remain

watch
over

truly

how

""Ah

exclaim
Kate

her

earnestly
upon
the

what

sadly

put

perhaps
you
will
have
hit
it

<EOS>
no

Kate

know

by
an
inward
monitor

by
this
dry

hollow
cough
—
that
I
be
not
long
for
this

I
be
anxious
to
know
what
will
become

when
you
find
yourself
alone

with
no

""Mother

inform

Fort
Washington

not
large
,
so
that
from
there
not
many
soldier
could
be
spare
for
scout
purpose
.
<EOS>
now
I
think
of
it
seriously
,
perhaps
we
have
better
give
up
our
premise
here
and
take
up
our
quarter
nearer
<EOS>
some
block
-
house!""but
<EOS>
why
so
,
mother
?
<EOS>
have
any
thing
new
and
startling
transpire
to
alarin
<EOS>
you?""Why
<EOS>
,
I
have
a
very
singular
dream
last
night
,
which
,
I
confess
,
trouble
me
not
a
little
on
your
account
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
be
stand
in
a
beantiful
arbor
,
surround
by
flower
of
all
color
and
variety
—
from
the
modest
pink
and
violet
,
to
the
large
and
luxuriant
rise
—
and
that
you
and
many
other
be
seat
around
,
array
in
white
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
some
solemn
occasion
of
rejoicing
—
something
like
a
wedding
,
and
yet
not
a
wedding
either
.
<EOS>
in
the
center
of
the
group
stand
an
old
,
grey
-
head
man
,
that
methought
be
our
pastor
;
and
yet
,
the
resemblance
to
him
be
not
perfect
,
but
confused
.
<EOS>
Methought
he
raise
his
tremble
hand
above
his
venerable
head
,
to
pronounce
a
benediction
,
when
suddenly
,
and
while
every
eye
be
upon
him
,
a
dark
cloud
envelop
us
,
and
forth
with
resound
shriek
and
groan
,
the
most
awful
I
ever
hear
.
<EOS>
suddenly
I
feel
my
self
grow
dizzy
—
indistinct
object
whirl
past
me
—
and
I
feel
myself
to
be
fall
—
down
—
down
—
down
—
into
a
horrible
lake
of
blood
—
when
your
father
,
pale
as
marble
,
spring
forward
,
clasp
me
in
his
arm
,
and
,
hurry
me
away
to
some
quiet
spot
,
whisper
in
my
ear
,
`
<EOS>
We
have
meet
to
part
no
more
.
'
<EOS>
with
a
cry
of
joy
,
tinge
with
the
horror
of
the
scene
I
have
just
witness
,
I
awake
,
and
find
myself
lie
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
what
augur
you
from
the
dream
,
my
daughter?""Why
,
I
do
not
think
it
best
to
give
ourselves
any
uneasiness
about
it
;
people
often
dream
as
strangely
,
without
any
serious
result
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
somehow
,
"
pursue
Mrs.
Clarendon
,
"
I
can
not
shake
off
the
impression
,
that
this
portend
evil
to
somebody
—
perhaps
myself
.
<EOS>
""God
forbid
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Kate
,
fervently
,
throw
her
arm
around
her
mother
's
neck
,
and
press
a
kiss
upon
her
fading
lip
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
God
forbid
that
any
thing
should
happen
you
,
dear
mother

<EOS>

let
us
hope
our
affliction
be
over
—
at
least
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
""It
be
always
proper
to
hope

child

and
God
in
his
goodness
have
so
ordain
it
,
that
there
be
but
few
situation
,
in
all
the
change
of
human
life
,
where

become
extinct

<EOS>
by
the
way
,
have
you
see
any
thing
of
Luther
of
late?""No
<EOS>
,
I
have
not
see
him

the
night
of
father

death

I
have
hear
of
his
being
in
the
vicinity
.
<EOS>
He
pass
through
the
village
a
few
day
since
,
and
I
believe
uttered
some
of
his
prophesie
;
one
of
which
be
to
the
effect
,
that
Columbia
would
never
be
a
city
;
and
another
,
that
treasure
have
be
conceal
on
the
bank
of
the
Little
Miami
.
<EOS>
some
have
put
faith
in

word

be
and
dig
for
gold

I
believe
nothing
unusual
have
be
the
result
.
<EOS>
""Strange
<EOS>
be
he
!
"
<EOS>
observe
Mrs.
Clarendon
,
musingly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Can
it
be
possible
that
he
be
gift
with
what
be
call
second
sight?""I
know
not
,
mother
,
what
be
his
gift
in
that
respect
;
but
I
do
know
,
that
he
foretell
some
thing
which
have
come
true
;
and
that
over
me
exercise
a
strange

of

preserve

the

could
my

prayer
avail
aught
,
you
should
never
feel
the
want
of
one
;
but
it
would
be
little
less
than
criminal
,
methinks
,
to
disguise
from
you
the
fact

that
,
as
regard
your

the
fatal
work
of
death
have
already

I
can
not

from

the

<EOS>
Kate
,
as
may
be
suppose
,
look
paler
—
more
sad
and
thoughtful
—
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
none
the
less
lovely
.
<EOS>
She
receive
the
greeting
of
her
friend
with
an
air
of
grace
and
cordiality
,
and
sometimes
,
though
but
seldom
,
smile
,
at
their
frequent
sally
of
wit

<EOS>
to
her
it
seem
a
grave
,
rather
than
light
occasion
,
and
one
little
suited

on

to
hilarity

<EOS>
however
much
she
may
have
jest
on
the

once

she

feel
in
all
its

the
responsibility

the
step
she

She
be
about

give
her
hand
,
for
good

ill

to
one

<EOS>
She

adieu

vision
of

<EOS>
She

<EOS>
It
be
a
great
and
grave
undertaking
—
a
new
epoch
in
her
life
—
and
though
she
waver
not
,
flinch
not
,
yet
she
tremble
and
feel
sad
at
the
thought
.
<EOS>
among
the
invite
guest

come
two
of
the
former
suitor
of

Danvers

place
in

which

our
fair
heroine

<EOS>
They
meet
her
frankly
,
and
cordially
,
with
no
show
of
pique

resentment
,
and
as
friend
who
take
a
deep
interest

<EOS>
"I
once
flatter
myself

say
danver
to
Kate

smile
pleasantly
,
"
that
I
should
be
a
prominent
actor
at
the
wedding
of
Kate
Clarendon
,
instead
of
a
spectator
;
but
matter
have
turn
out
otherwise

<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
none
the
bad
for
you
,
"
return
Kate
,
incline
her
head
to
the
maiden
who

and
heart
of
her
former
suitor

<EOS>
"we

"
be
the
reply
of
danver
,
look
fondly
toward
her
whose
arm
he
hold

<EOS>
"We
lose
the
race
,
and
should
fain
be
content

put
in
Danbury

with
a

come
up
at
the
moment
,
with
a
pretty
maiden
also
hang
on
his
arm

<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
in

"
return
Kate
,
pointedly

pun
upon
the
word

to
his
fair
companion

"Why
<EOS>
as
to
win
,
"
rejoin
Danbury
,
laughing
,
"
that
will
depend
much
upon
a
certain
monosyllable
from
Emma
here
.
<EOS>
""Fie

"
say
Emma

<EOS>
an
hour
from
the

in
of

<EOS>
as
be
customary
at
that
day

each
of
the
young
man
have
bring
with
him
his
rifle
,
more
from
the
force
of
habit
and
precaution
,
than
from
any
suppose
use
he
would
have
for
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
also
,
as
a
matter
of
form
,
think
advisable
to
station
a
sentinel
without
,
that
,
in
case
anything
unusual
should
happen
,
alarm
may
be
give
.
<EOS>
this
last
precaution
would
doubtless
have
be
neglect
,
but
for
the
report
abroad
,
that
a
small
body
of
Indians
have
be
see

not
long
since
,
within
a
few
mile
of

<EOS>
in
conse

of
this
rumor
,
some
of
the
more
timid

repair
to
the

house
;
but
the
majority
of
the
citizen
of
Columbia
think
lightly
of
the
news
,
and
turn
not
aside
from
their
usual
routine
of
business
.
<EOS>
the

<EOS>
at
wedding
of
this
period

a
supper

on

occasion
,
the
decline
health
of
her
mother
,
together
with
the
late
loss
of
her
father

have
be
a
sufficient
reason

It

who

in
addition
to
the
quality

fulfill
the
duty

a

in
stern
repose

like
so
many

<EOS>
as
the
first
sensation
to

be
the
same
—
so
,
as
a
general
thing
,
the
feeling
immediately
precede
a
wedding
and

be
strangely
alike

<EOS>
there

a
secret
awe

an
unaccountable
solemnity

such

the
feeling

from
a
lively

gay
conversation

and
finally
have
cease

<EOS>
as
minute
after
minute

inquiringly

with
face
expressive
of
surprise
at
the
delay

and
then
low
whisper
steal
around
the
circle
,
of
strange
conjecture
,
give
a
more
gloomy
turn
to
the
whole
affair
.
<EOS>
as
for
Kate
,
her
feature
have
become
as
white

and
almost
as
rigid

as
marble

robe
in
her
wedding
garment

clasp
the
thin

transparent
hand
of
her

a
beautiful

<EOS>
the

the

have
rather
suddenly
give
place
to
a
pallor
almost
frightful

and
her
now
deeply
sunke
eye
rove
around
the
apartment
,
nervously
,
over
the
whisper
group
,
as
if
in

<EOS>
"It

"
My

<EOS>
It

beautiful
night

over
the
eastern
hill

and
pour
her
gray
light
down
into
the
forest
of
the

a
twilight
indistinctness

a

there

define
the
course
of

give
indication
of
a
foggy
night

<EOS>
as
Kate
and
her
companion
turn
their
face
toward
the
west
and
listen
,
the
tramp
of

more
audible
,
until
at

the
shadowy
outline

irrevocable

He

<EOS>
He

and
,
open
the
Bible
on
the
stand
before
him
,
select
and
read
a
passage
applicable
to
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
then
bid
Ernest
and
Kate
stand
upon
their
foot
,
and
commence
the
solemn
ceremony
,
amid
a
breathless
silence
.
<EOS>
every
eye
be
fix
upon
the
youthful
pair
—
upon
the
pale
,
sweet
feature
of
Kate
,
as
she
stand
downcast
and

upon
the
noble

<EOS>
every

an
occasion
more
solemn

whenever
the

,
more
deep
.
<EOS>
not
a
breath
,
even
,
could
be
hear
,
and
the
fall
of
a
pin
would
have
be
audible
.
<EOS>
all
feel
a
strange
sensation
of
awe
and
fear
,
as
if
some
calamity
be
about
to
befall
them
,
yet
none
could
give
a
reason
for
it
.
<EOS>
even
the
venerable
pastor
himself
seem
to
be
uncommonly
affect
;
for
once
or
twice
he
pause
and
glance
around
the
apartment
,
as
if

to
behold
some
unwelcome
object
.
<EOS>
already
have
he

the
necessary
question
,
receive
the
affirmative
answer

<EOS>
a
groan
,
and
then
by
the
most
horrible
yell
imaginable

<EOS>
Maidens

and
rush
to
their
rifle

which
,
unfortunately
,
have

in
the

,
spring
upon
the
table
,
and

completely
overcome
by
the
excitement
,
have
sink
to
the
floor
in
a
state
of
insensibility
.
<EOS>
for
a
moment
the
foremost
savage
,
who
appear
to
be
chief
of
the
party
,
look
hurriedly
around
him
,
as

when
his

fall
upon
Kate

and
save

rudely
from

embrace
of
her
mother
,
he
draw
his
knife
and
plunge

into
the
heart
of
the
latter
;
then
raise
the
former
in
his
arm
,
he
rush
to
the
door
,
with
a
laugh
so
fiendish
it
make
the
blood
of
all
who
hear
it
curdle
,
and
,
bound
into
the
open
air
,
dart
into
a
neighbor
thicket
with
his
prize
.
<EOS>
as
the
captor
of
Kate
spring
through
the
door
,
Clifton
regain
his
foot
,
in
time
to
see
her
disappear
.
<EOS>
with
a
cry
of
vengeance
and
dispair
,
he
leap
forward
to
her
rescue
,
when
a
blow
on
the
head
,
from
one
of
the
Indians
,
intercept
his
progress
,
and
lay
him
senseless
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
meantime
,
the
onset
of
the
savage
have
be
terrific
.
<EOS>
with
horrible
yell
,
tomahawk
in

,
they
rush
upon
the
unarmed

and
deal
their
blow
on
every
side
two

,
and
their
scalp

<EOS>
two

be
severely

,
and
two

,
when
Ichabod
,
who
on
the
first
alarm
have
escape
into
the
adjoin
cabin
,
return
with
his
arm
load
with
rifle
.
<EOS>
with
a
presence
of
mind
and
dexterity
worthy
a
hero
,
he
manage
to
distribute
some
five
or
six
of
these
weapon
among
his
friend
,
ere
<EOS>
the
Indians
become
aware
of
what
be
take
place
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
the
first
intimation
they
have
of
the
matter
,
be
from
the
discharge
of
one
which
the
gardener
have
reserve
for
himself
,
whereby
a
powerful
savage
,
who
be
dart
forward
to
seize
upon
a
terrified
female
,
be
shoot
through
the
body
.
<EOS>
with
a
yell
of
rage
and
pain
,

up
from

ground
and
fall
back

corpse
.
<EOS>
this
astonish
the
dusky
warrior

on
his
rear
,
and
they
pause
in
their
work
of
carnage
.
<EOS>
perceive
at
a
glance
that
several
of
the
white
have
suddenly
become
armed
,
and
be
prepare
to
deal
death
among
them
,
they
give
vent
to
yell
of
fury
and
alarm
,
and
simultaneously
rush
out
of
the
cottage
,
bear
their
dead
comrade
with
them
,
but
leave
their
prisoner
behind
.
<EOS>
with
yell
little
less
frightful
than
their
own
,
those
of
the
white
who
be
arm
,
now
sally
forth
to
give
chase
.
<EOS>
as
they
reach
the
door
,
they
see
the
savage
already
dodge
among
the
tree
,
and
speed
forward
with
a
velocity
that
destroy
all
hope
of
overtake
them
.
<EOS>
besides
,
should
they
pursue
,
it
be
more
than
probable
they
would
be
draw
into
an
ambuscade
and
all
cut
off
;
and
act
with
more
wisdom
and
caution
than
be
usual
on
such
occasion
,
they
discharge
their
piece
at
random
after
the
foe
,
and
retreat
into
the
house

instantly
closed
and
bolt

well
calculated
to

who
have
come

,
but
an
hour
before
,
full
of
life
,
and
hope
,
and
buoyant
feeling
—
now
fast
grow
cold
in
the
embrace
of
death
—
their
once
handsome
feature
distort
and
bloody
,
and
their
scalp
already

at
the
girdle
of
some
inhuman
monster
of
the
forest
.

frightfully
stain
with
the
red
current
of

,
which

and
apparently
not

<EOS>
the

command
silence

so
far

and
seemingly
unmoved
spectator

meekly
fold
on

the

of
humility

resignation

when

order
for
those

their
service
at

in

minute

for
the
perilous
journey

<EOS>
the

two
other
,
remain
to
take
charge
of
the
nearly
distract
female
,
until
aid
should
arrive
from
the
village
—
when
the
wound
would
be

for

and
the
dead
consign
to
dust
,
with
all
due
ceremony
.
<EOS>
collect
what

together
with

around

the
solemn

It

rush
to
each

a
freedom

wildness
which
nothing

a
similar

could
justify

throw
themselves
into
each

's
arm
,
and
cling
around
each

neck
,
as
if
they
feel
the
separation
to
be
eternal
;
while
groans
,
cry
and
sobs
of
anguish
resound
on
all
side

<EOS>
for
some
moment
all
be
great
commotion
;

gradually
the
tumult
cease
,
until
nothing
could
be
hear
but
<EOS>
a
low
murmur
,
in
a
choke
voice
,
or
a
deep
draw
sigh
,
or
a
half
stifled
burst
of
grief

"we

at

"go

<EOS>
"Let

us
follow
the

he
continue
,
"
<EOS>
for
I
know
of

it
be
possible
that
in

strike
upon

""Is

rise
another
perpendicular
rock
,
and
on
either
side
be
a
deep
and
gloomy
chasm
.
<EOS>
through
one
of
these
—
that
at
your
right
hand
—
flow
a
rapid
streamlet
,
whose
water
,
unseen
from
where
you
stand
,
gurgle
over
the
rock
below
,
send
upward
a
hollow
,
dismal
sound
,
that
invariably
cause
the
spectator
,
who
visit
it
for
the
first
time
,
to
wish
himself
once
more
safe
on
the
plain
below
.
<EOS>
Gloomy
as
be
the
place
in
question
,
it
be
not
without
its
attraction
.
<EOS>
the
eye
here
embrace
an
extensive
scope
of
country
,
spread
before
it
like
a
map
.
<EOS>
a
large
and
well
cultivate
plain
,
of
two
or
three
mile
in
breadth
—
through
the
center
of
which
<EOS>
wind
<EOS>
the
glassy
stream
so
often
mention
,
intersperse
with
here
and
there
a
tidy
farm
house
,
or
a
cluster
of
white
dwelling
,
form
a
village
,
with
the
steeple
of
its
church
overlook
it
with
an
air
of
guardianship
—
stretch
away
to
the
north
and
south
,
and
contrast
delightfully
with
the
rough
and
wilder
scenery
at
hand
.
<EOS>
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
,
however
,
the
plain
have
none
of
the
attraction
of
civilization
it
now
present
;
but
a
mighty
,
unbroken
forest
,
instead
,
lie
on
its
bosom
,
in
whose
dark
recess
danger
everywhere
lurk
,
and
man
and
beast
war
with
themselves
and
each
other
continually
.
<EOS>
It
be
late
on
the
day
succeed
the
capture
of
Kate
Clarendon
,
that
a
tall
,
slim
figure
,
in
the
costume
of
an
Indian
,
leap
,
with
a
light
bind
,
across
the
chasm
on
the
left
,
and
pause
,
for
a
moment
,
upon
the
platform
of
the
rock
we
have
describe
.
<EOS>
the
sun
be
already
sink
in
the
west
,
and
his
ray
stream
softly
along
the
top
of
the
tree
,
tip
them
with
gold
,
throw
the
figure
into
bold
relief
,
and
burnish
the
huge
erection
of
nature
,
until
one
could
,
with
but
little
stretch
of
the
imagination
,
fancy
them
colossal
image
of
brass
.
<EOS>
We
have
say
the
figure
be
costume
like
an
Indian
;
but
that
he
be
not
of
this
race
,
be
evident
from
the
whiteness
of
his
skin
,
wherever
the
removal
of
the
paint
,
by
perspiration
or
otherwise
,
permit
it
to
be
see
.
<EOS>
there
be
other
sign
go
to
prove
him
not
a
native
warrior
.
<EOS>
His
arm
seem
tender
,
as
if
not
accustomed
to
exposure
,
and
be
scratch
in
several
place
,
by
bramble
and
thorn
,
so
as
to
render
them
swollen
and
sore
.
<EOS>
the
feather
,
intend
as
ornament
to
his
scalp
-
lock
,
have
also
become
disarranged
,
in
a
manner
that
the
pride
of
a
native
Indian
would
never
have
permit
.
<EOS>
around
his
waist
he
wear
a
wampun
belt
,
support
a
brace
of
pistol
,
a
tomahawk
and
scalping
-
knife
.
<EOS>
as
he
pause
upon
the
rock
,
he
run
his
black
,
fiery
eye
over
the
plain
,
for
a
moment
,
as
if
to
be
certain
no
one
be
approach
.
<EOS>
then
he
glance
cautiously
around
him
,
and
a
malignant
expression
of
triumph
light
up
and
gradually
settle
over
his
feature
.
<EOS>
"Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
I
have
her
safe
now
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
,
with
an
oath
;
and
run
to
the
side
of
the
rock
overhang
the
stream
,
he
begin
to
let
himself
down
its
jaggy
side
,
and
presently
disappear
altogether
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
on
this
side
,
a
rough
kind
of
staircase
,
overhang
the
foam
flood
;
and
down
this
the
figure
descend
rapidly
,
take
hold
of
the
bush
and
projection
,
to
prevent
himself
from
fall
,
until
he
come
to
a
spot
where
the
rock
jut
completely
over
the
stream
,
and
form
a
sure
foundation
to
his
foot
.
<EOS>
halt
here
for
a
moment
,
and
listen
the
while
,
he
turn
to
the
right
,
and
pass
under
the
rocky
bank
,
enter
the
mouth
of
a
cavern
,
which
extend
back
into
the
hill
a
considerable
distance
.
<EOS>
hurry
rapidly
forward
,
through
a
narrow
passage
,
he
at
last
come
to
a
stone
,
which
he
with
difficulty
remove
,
and
emerge
into
a
compartment
of
great
breadth
and
size
,
dimly
light
by
a
small
opening
or
fissure
in
the
rock
above
,
whence
trickle
down
,
or
rather
filter
through
,
just
sufficient
water
to
render
the
rock
beneath
wet
and
slippery
.
<EOS>
here
the
figure
pause
again
,
and
endeavor
to
peer
into
the
further
recess
of
the
cave
;
but
it
be
evident
from
his
manner
,
and
the
fact
that
he
have
so
recently
come
from
the
broad
light
of
day
into
a
place
never
at
any
time
more
than
twilight
,
that
he
could
not
discern
a
single
object
.
<EOS>
step
aside
somewhat
,
to
avoid
the
dripping
water
,
he
at
once
proceed
to
strike
a
light
.
<EOS>
a
half
-
burn
torch
lie
on
the
floor
of
the
cavern
,
which
re
-
lighting
,
he
proceed
to
search
the
place
,
hold
this
in
his
hand
,
elevate
above
his
head
,
so
as
to
enable
him
to
discern
each
thing
distinctly
.
<EOS>
for
some
time
it
be
evident
by
his
lower
brow
,
angry
visage
and
keen
search
eye
,
that
he
be
unable
to
find
the
object
seek
.
<EOS>
but
at
length
he
pause
,
utter
a
wild
yell
,
not
unlike
an
Indian
,
and
then
spring
forward
to
a
dark
corner
of
the
cavern
,
where
another
figure
,
array
in
white
,
be
crouch
,
and
tremble
with
terror
.
<EOS>
"Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
I
have
thee
now
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
,
with
a
hoarse
burst
of
passion
,
and
a
laugh
like
a
fiend
;
and
the
next
moment
he
stand
over
the
crouch
object
,
wave
his
torch
from
side
to
side
,
and
resemble
,
as
the
ruddy
light
flash
upon
his
dark
,
malignant
face
,
some
infernal
spirit
,
about
to
seize
upon
an
innocent
victim
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
to
what
be
I
destine
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
in
silvery
,
but
heart
-
touch
tone
,
the
voice
of
the
unhappy
object
at
the
monster
's
foot
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
moment
,
the
ruddy
,
gloomy
light
fall
upon
the
pale
,
sweet
feature
of
a
terrified
female
,
as
she
attempt
to
rise
and
confront
her
foe
.
"destine
<EOS>
to
perdition
with
me
!
"
return
the
savage
,
with
another
fiendish
laugh
,
roughly
grasp
an
arm
of
the
maiden
,
and
raise
her
to
an
upright
posture
.
<EOS>
"
now
I
have
thee

this

know
about

flee

I

,
toward
an
indian
settlement

ere
<EOS>
I
reach
one

I
fall
in
with

scout
party
of
Piquas

their

again

put
the

on
his
back

soon
grow
weary

pause
under
a
tree
to
rest

creep
up

Moody

change
suddenly
from

down

in

with

mortal

and
so
,
after
affix
my
mark
,
I
leave
him
,
and
,
climb
a
tree
,
station
myself
where
I
could
see
the
result
.
<EOS>
the
result
of
course
you
know
,
and
so
I
shall
not
detail
it
.
<EOS>
""well
,
I
return
to
my
dusky
brother
and
tell
my
tale
.
<EOS>
They
listen
gravely
,
and
ask
me
for
the
scalp
of
my
white
foe
.
<EOS>
this
I
have
forget
;
and
they
laugh
at
me
,
and
tell
me
I
have
kill
a
deer
,
and
think
it
a
warrior
in
disguise
.
<EOS>
I
feel
chagrined
,
and
tell
them
I
would
prove
myself
what
I
pretend
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
go
forth
again
alone
,
and
return
with
two
white
scalp
.
<EOS>
then
they
seem
greatly
pleased
,
and
make
me
a
sort
of
chief
,
and
give
me
command
of
a
scout
party
.
<EOS>
"Now
<EOS>
it
be

I
feel
my
design
would
at
last
be
gain
,
and
you

"One

night

steal
round
your

I
see
you

forth
together

I
keep
you
both
in

<EOS>
You
pause
on
the
river

sigh
to
each

<EOS>
Heavens

<EOS>
how

boil

crush
you

me

I
listen
to
your

I
become
tired

disgusted

"At

I

I

You

upward

into

""Great

We

,
in
pursuit
of
the
Indians

to

we

now
return

<EOS>
for
some
eight

ten
mile

they
pursue
their
course
up
the
Miami

<EOS>
by

time
the
mist

which
we

rise
on

departure

have
roll
itself
across
the
plain

envelop
them
in
a
cloud

fall
over
it

whereupon
the
whole
party
come
to
a
halt

"It

attempt
further
progress

Blind
Luther

the
Necromancer

on

with
a

at

with
something

it

Luther
into

relief

a

give
them

at

an
appearance

rapid

by
its

<EOS>
for
a
moment
or
two
,
Luther
sit
in
silence

while
silently
our

gaze
upon
him
—
and
then
his
voice
be

from
the

"We

forward
into

further

peremptorily

Blind
Luther
turn
his
back
upon

in
a
manner
to
cut
off
all

think
it
prudent
not
to
press
the
matter
too
much

move
away

join
his
com

who
have
already
select

<EOS>
turn
his
eye
toward

could
just
perceive
the
dim
outline

mysterious
being

seat
upon
the
rock

his
elbow
rest
upon

asleep

gaze
upon

conjecture
pass
through
his

to
who

what

dimly

nod
a

It

there

some

"'Spect

David
Grant
,
in
a
dissatisfied
tone

be
anxious

display
of

"You

<EOS>
David
make
no

the

set
forward

<EOS>
instead
of
descend
to
the
valley

the
Necromancer
shape
his
course
to
the
top
of
the
ridge
,
along
which
he
move
in
silence
with
rapid
stride
,
follow
by
the
other
in
the

manner

<EOS>
here
the
fog
have
already
begin
to
disappear

and
presently
the
sun
break
through

bright
and
glorious
.
<EOS>
then
,
like
some
mighty
avalanche
,
the
mist
be
see
roll
down
toward
the
plain
,
over
which
it
lie
like
a
white
shroud
,
occasionally
diversify
and
render
doubly
interesting
by
a
beautiful
rainbow
set
on
its
brow
,
as
it
be
a
beacon
of
hope
.
<EOS>
gradually
it
begin
to
drive
and
writhe
and
scatter
,
under
the
influence
of
the
sun
and
the
morning
breeze
,
and
then
first
one
tree
and
another
begin
to
show
its
leafy
top
,
as
if
rise
from
a
beautiful
lake
,
until
at
last
the
whole
vapor
be
sweep
away
,
and
a
scene
resplendant
in
beauty
break
upon
the
eye
.
<EOS>
Clifton
,
who
have
watch
it
intently
as
he
proceed
on
his
jour
ney
,
feel
his
spirit
revive
to
a
wonderful
degree
,
while
something
within
seem
to
say:"Behold
in
this
a
happy
angury
!
<EOS>
as
the
night
and
the
morning
,
so
have
thy
soul
be
shroud
in
a
vapor
of
gloom
,
through
which
no

could
penetrate
to
see
what
lie
beyond
.
<EOS>
as
the
mist
have
vanish
before
the
god

so
shall
thy
trouble
vanish
before
the
bright
star
of
thy

thy

shall
lead
down
to
the
grave

smooth

bright

unclouded

"For
<EOS>
a
time
Clifton
be
buoy
up
with
this
feeling
,
and
then
he
become
dejected
and
sad
;
for
he
remember
that
she
he
love
be
yet
a
prisoner

<EOS>
throughout
the
day
,
Blind
Luther
say
little
to
any
—
his
mind
seemingly
absorb
by
some
gloomy
meditation
.
<EOS>
when
question
as
to
his
course
,
he
ever
reply
that
all
be
right
.
<EOS>
about
noon
,
a
fine
buck
be
kill
,
and
the
party
halt
for
refreshment
.
<EOS>
after
a
delay
of
some
two
hour
,
they
resume
their
journey
,
much
invigorate
.
<EOS>
now
whether
it
be
that
Luther
have
make
a
mistake
in
regard
to
the
exact
location
of
the
cave
where
Kate
Clarendon
be
confine
—
or
whether
he
desire
,
for
somereason
of
his
own
,
to
delay
their
arrival
to
a
give
time
—
do
not
appear
;
but
certain
it
be
,
that
though
the
cave
do
not
exceed
a
distance
of
twenty
mile
from
where
the
party
set
out
in
the
morning
,
and
though
all
travel
hard
throughout
the
day
,
with
the
exception
of
the
delay
speak

yet
,
from
one
reason

another

they

"Why

""And

closer

who
throw
his

he

"Great

be
the

return
into

they
be
inform
of
the
sudden
and
mysterious
disappearance
of
Luther

for
none
have
see
him
,
and
all
be
willing
to
swear
he
have
not
pass
out
the
way
he
enter

<EOS>
Ichabod
declare
,
however

that
the
smoke
of
his
rifle
,
when
he
fire
at
Moody
,
have
assume
a
terrible
shape
;
and
now
he
remember
it
strangely
resemble

Necromancer

though
how
the
smoke
and
that
singular
personage
could
be
in
any
wise
alike
,
or
connect
,
exceed
his
comprehension

<EOS>
the
mystery
now
become
a
matter
of
grave
discussion
;
some
declare
that
Luther
be
an
evil
spirit
,
whose
term
on
earth
expire
with
the
death
of
Moody
;
and
other
,
among
whom
be
Clifton

Kate
,
contend
that
both
be
bona

being
of
flesh

blood
,
though
the
former
be
a
very
strange
character
,
whom
they
could
not
comprehend

<EOS>
one
observation
bring
another
,
and
the
discussion
seem
likely
to
be
protract
all
night
,
when
Clifton
order
a
sentinel
to
be
station
in
the
passage
before
speak
of
,
and
the
rest
to
retire
to
rest

<EOS>
the
account
give
by
danver
,
of
the
disappearance
of
Moody
,
be
correct
;
but
his
conjecture
that
he
have
be
wound
by
the
last
fire
of
Ichabod
be
not
.
<EOS>
at
the
time
when
Moody
rush
out
of
the
cave
,
follow
by
those
who
seek
his
life
,
object
at
a
short
distance
have
become
indistinct
,
in
the
dark
grey
twilight
which
have
already
settle
over
the
earth
.
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
,
the
gardener
miss
his
mark
;
but
the
report
of
the
rifle
,
and
the
whizzing
of
its
ball
within
an
inch
of
his
head
,
cause
Moody
to
start
suddenly
,
when
his
foot
slip
,
his
balance
be
lose
,
and
he
plunge
down
the
chasm
,
with
a
horrible
yell
,
expect
of
course
to
be
dash
to
piece
on
the
rock
below
.
<EOS>
a
deep
pool
of
water
,
which
have
be
hollow
out
by
the
fall
of
a
cascade
,
save
him
.
<EOS>
into
this
he
fall
with
a
force
that
for
a
moment
stun
and
confuse
him
;
but
quickly
regain
his
sense
,
he
strike
out
boldly
,
and
succeed
in
crawl
upon
a
rock
,
that
form
a
partial
barrier
to
the
outlet
of
the
pool
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
not
affect
without
difficulty
and
repeat
trial
;
for
the
spray
from
the
cascade
,
that
tumble
over
a
precipice
a
short
distance
behind
him
,
have
coat
the
rock
with
a
slimy
substance
,
and
make
it
slippery
as
an
iceberg
.
<EOS>
seat
himself
at
last
upon
the
rock
,
with
as
much
composure
as
he
could
assume
,
after
have
be
so
signally
thwart
in
his
dark
schme
,
he
instantly
set
his
head
to
plot
the
good
mean
by
which
he
could
yet
retrieve
what
he
have
lose
,
and
revenge
himself
for
the
new
indignity
that
have
be
heap
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"they
think
me
dead
of
course
,
"
he
mutter
to
himself
;
"
and
well
they
may
,
after
pitch
me
into
such
a
dark
,
dungeon
-
like
thundering
hole
as
this
;
but
I
will
show
them
I
be
not
thus
easily
put
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
as
it
be
,
for
now
they
will
think
themselves
safe
,
and
thus
give
me
the
well
chance
to
make
sure
plan
and
take
them
unawares
.
<EOS>
a
curse
on
that
old
juggler
,
who
have
thwart
my
design
so
often
!
<EOS>
by
—
!
<EOS>
I
will
soon
have
his
old
scalp
where
it
will
not
trouble
me
again
—
that
be
if
he
be
mortal
,
"
he
add
,
in
an
under
tone
,
endeavor
to
peer
around
him
into
the
darkness
,
as
if
fearful
that
he
of
whom
he
speak
may
somehow
mysteriously
make
his
appearance
,
as
he
have
more
than
once
do
before
.
"Who
<EOS>
and
what
can
he
be
any
how
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
continue
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
something
wonderful
about
him
,
I
must
own
;
and
even
the
savage
fear
,
and
respect
him
,
and
call
him
Great
Medicine
.
<EOS>
and
what
do
he
know
of
me
,
and
how
do
he
obtain
his
knowledge
?
<EOS>
by
heaven
!
<EOS>
the
more
I
think
and
see
of
him
,
<EOS>
the
more
mysterious
he
seem
.
<EOS>
Can
it
be
that
what
he
say
be
true
?
<EOS>
I
would
not
believe
it
,
but
that
I
see
,
with
my
own
eye
,
the
mark
under
my
left
arm
.
<EOS>
there
can
be
no
deny
that
,
at
all
event
—
unless
(
and
Moody
pause
and
muse
,
as
one
who
doubt
and
yet
be
incline
to
believe)—unless
he
by
some
strange
magic
power
make
it
to
appear
there
for
the
time

<EOS>
at
all
event

add
,
fiercely

it

now

the
flesh
with
it
,
as
I
can
sorely
feel
;

by
—

<EOS>
I
will
have
my
revenge
on
him
yet

die
in
the
attempt

resume
the
outcast
,
after
another
short
pause
.
<EOS>
"
May
be
I
be
,

was—(on
the
last
word

lay
particular
emphasis
)
—

—
for
now
that
the
totem
be

enough

me

for
this

for
this
I
would
have
revenge

though
his
claim
to
the
fraternal

be
never
so
well
proven

my

a

too

I
will
have
all
settle
ere
long
.
<EOS>
now
to
get
out
of
this
infernal
place
;
for
infernal
it
seem
,
and
dark
as
the
region
of
the
damned
.
<EOS>
I
be
wet
and
chilly
,
and
my
wound
feel
painful
.
<EOS>
let
me
once
get
out
of
this
place
,
and
I
trust
my
dusky
brother
may
be
easily
find

even
if
they

move
their
camp

<EOS>
It
be
not
deep
—
not
more
than
five
inch

the
most
—
but
a
rather
abrupt
declivity
give
it
an
impetus
that
send
it
foam

over
the
rock
in
its
course
to
the
plain

dangerous

his
heart
beat
fast
and
hard
against
his
breast

sometimes
seem

rise
in

could
over
the
slimy
stone
and
treacherous
ground
beneath
his
foot
.
<EOS>
for
some
time
he
continue
his
descent
slowly
,
without
meet
any
difficulty
worthy
of
notice
.
<EOS>
He
have
already
advance
a
hundred
yard
,
and
be
begin
to
congratulate
himself
on
his
second
escape
,
when
his
ear
be
salute
with
a
faint
,
dull
,
roar
sound
,
like
the
fall
of
a
heavy
body
of
water
.
<EOS>
He
pause
in
dismay
,
and
listen
.
<EOS>
He
could
hear
it
distinctly
,
above
the
more
shallow
roaring
,
if
we
may
so
express
it
,
of
the
torrent
rush
past
.
<EOS>
He
comprehend
the
fearful
truth
,
and
again
his
heart
die
within
him
,
and
he
would
have
sink
down
in
despair
,
have
he
not
fear
the
awful
denouement
would
be
hasten
by
quit
his
hold
of
the
rock
.
<EOS>
ahead
of
him
be
certainly
another
cascade
,
the
the
brow
of
which
he
be
near
at
every
step
,
and
down
which
he
must
assuredly
plunge
—
or
,
what
be
equally
as
terrifying
,
remain
imprisoned
where
he
be
.
<EOS>
for
some
moment
he
stand
irresolute
what
to
do
,
during
which
his
extreme
agony
of
mind
cause
a
cold
perspiration
to
ooze
from
every
pore
of
his
skin
.
<EOS>
for
almost
the
first
time
in
his
life
of
guilt
he
try
to
pray
;
but
the
word
stick
in
his
throat
,
and
seem
to
choke
him
.
<EOS>
death
,
now
that
he
have
feel
so
confident
of
escape
,
rise
up
before
him
in
all
its
terror
.
<EOS>
despair
at
last
take
the
place
of
hope
and
foar
,
and
he
be
on
the
point
of
throw
himself
flat
-
wise
on
the
current
,
and
trust
the
rest
to
chance
,
when
a
new
idea
strike
him
,
and
he
suddenly
exclaimed:"What
a
fool
I
be
to
get
frighten
at
imaginary
terror
!
<EOS>
how
do
I
know
there
be
not
a
way
to
pass
these
fall
without
go
down
with
the
water?"saying
this
,
his
courage
revive
,
and
he
again
move
forward
with
renew
hope
.
<EOS>
nearer
and
nearer
he
draw
to
the
fall
,
and
louder
and
louder
come
up
the
sullen
roar
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
stand
upon
the
verge
of
the
precipice
,
and
,
with
the
utmost
difficulty
,
prevent
his
foot
from
be
draw
down
into
the
unknown
chasm
,
by
the
force
of
the
rapid
.
<EOS>
He
carefully
feel
of
the
rock
to
which
he
cling
,
but
,
to
his
disappointment
,
could
find
no
broken
or
craggy
place
to
aid
him
in
his
descent
.
<EOS>
all
,
as
before
,
be
upright
,
smooth
and
solid
,
save
occasionally
a
little
crag
that
make
a
hold
for
his
finger
.
<EOS>
again
hope
die
,
and
he
secretly
wish
for
that
great
change
which
his
guilty
soul
shrink
to
encounter
.
<EOS>
what
be
to
be
do
?
<EOS>
He
could
not
long
remain
where
he
be
,
for
his
effort
to
keep
himself
there
<EOS>
have
already
tire
his
arm
,
and
weaken
him
not
a
little
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
decide
to
retrace
his
step
,
until
he
should
come
to
an
easy
footing
,
and
there
,
if
possible
,
hold
out
till
daylight
should
enable
him
to
devise
some
mean
of
escape
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
with
great
caution
,
and
at
the
risk
of
his
life
,
he
move
up
the
stream
some
fifty
yard
,
when
he
come
to
a
place
where
the
rock
slightly
jut
out
,
so
that
he
could
place
his
body
against
it
,
and
rest
somewhat
comfortably
.
<EOS>
here
he
determine
on
remain
till
morning
—
or
,
at
all
event
,
until
the
moon
,
which
be
a
little
past
her
full
,
have
arise
sufficiently
to
light
up
his
gloomy
abode
.
<EOS>
terrible
be
the
thought
that
now
crowd
the
mind
of
this
dark
man
.
<EOS>
alone
,
as
it
be
in
the
bowel
of
the
earth
,
with
danger
on
every
hand
,
he
be
thus
force
to
think
and
feel
as
he
have
never
do
before
;
and
as
,
unless
under
similar
circumstance
,
he
may
never
do
again
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
thing
to
face
death
in
the
heat
of
strife
,
when
all
the
faculty
of
the
mind
be
turn
into
the
channel
of
self
-
defense
,
ambition
,
glory
or
revenge
—
when
thought
of
the
great
hereafter
be
lose
in
the
wild
,
frenzied
passion
of
the
moment
—
and
another
to
contemplate
it
in
silence
,
alone
,
away
from
aught
that
can
distract
the
mind
.
<EOS>
men
talk
of
hero
—
of
courage
on
the
field
of
battle
—
where
everything
be
calculate
to
excite
,
intoxicate
,
bewilder
,
and
draw
them
forward
to
<EOS>
they
know
not
what
,
nor
have
time
nor
power
to
know
;
but
this
be
no
more
to
be
compare
to
that
moral
courage
which
can
meet
death
calmly
in
solitude
,
than
be
the
wild
blustering
of
a
drunken
man
to
what
one
<EOS>
coolly
and
firmly
assert
in
sober
reason
.
<EOS>
the
one
be
the
bravery
of
the
animal
merely
,
without
the
action
of
the
mind
;
the
other
,
the
courage
of
the
mind
,
without
the
action
of
the
body
.
<EOS>
in
proof
of
this
,
how
often
do
we
hear
of
man
,
who
,
amid
the
carnage
of
the
ensanguined
field
,
have
rush
up
reckless
,
fearless
of
all
danger
,
to
the
belch
cannon
's
mouth
,
place
their
life
as
if
by
choice
in
the
great
jeopardry
,
and
thus
win
laurel
of
courage
to
bind
their
brow
forever
,
and
make
them
model
hero
for
future
age
—
shrink
back
in
their
calm
,
sober
moment
,
like
some
timid
boy
,
from
the
near
approach
of
death
.
<EOS>
of
this
last
class

under
the

he
be

so
far
as

as
the
brave
;
but
take
these
away

as
in
the
present
instance
,
and
he
become
at
once
the
veri
coward
on

<EOS>
there
be
ever
something
awful
in
contemplate
death
,
when
all
the
energy
and
reason
power
of
the
mind
be
in
full
blast
;
when
we
see
and
feel
that
we
be
slowly
,
but
surely
,
hasten
to
that
dread
change
which
all
must
undergo
,
but
of
which
no
one
knoweth
that
hath
a
being
in
the
mortal
state
;
when
we
be
throw
off
this
earthly
coil
,

a

farewell
to

the

,
in

he
believe

he
at

be
one

great

the
Creator
design

the
good
lesson
we
can
draw
from

be

that

at

the
uncertainty
of

<EOS>
by
the
common
phrase

that

even
take
the
precaution
to
station
sentinel
—
a
proof
that
they
feel
themselves
perfectly
secure
.
<EOS>
They
be
in
the
indian
country
,
where
all
the
tribe
be
friendly
to
each
other
,
and
afar
,
as
they
imagine
,
from
the
white
,
their
only
enemy
.
'
<EOS>
tis
,
true
,
they
have
be
on
the
war
-
path
against
the
latter
,
and
some
of
their
garment
be
yet
stain
with
the
blood
of
recent
victim
;
while
,
at
the
girdle
of
two
,
hung
fresh
scalp
.
<EOS>
It
be
natural
to
suppose
they
would
be
follow
,
yet
they
seem
to
have
no
fear
—
fancy
doubtless
,
that
they
be
now
either
too
far
distant
to
be
overtake
immediately
,
or
that
their
foe
be
too
unskillful
on
the
trail
to
find
them
;
and
the
more
so
,
that
they
have
break
it
for
mile
by
pass
up
the
bed
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
thus
they
sleep
in
security
—
not
as
soundly
,
perhaps
,
as
they
would
have
do
in
their
own
cabin
,
but
sufficiently
sound
to
answer
all
the
purpose
of
nature
,
in
refresh
their
weary
body
—
while
the
wane
moon
,
ride
high
in
the
heavens
,
pour
down
over
all
her
flood
of
mellow
light
,
and
partially
dim
the
glare
of
the
fire
of
their
camp
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
far
from
the
meridian
of
night
when
a
tall
figure
glide
among
the
tree
,
and
stealthily
approach
them
.
<EOS>
when
within
ten
yard
,
he
halt
,
examine
them
at
tentively
,
and
then
,
as
if
satisfied
all
be
right
,
advanced
boldly
toward
the
circle
.
<EOS>
even
this
last
movement
seem
unheeded
,
tho
'
one
or
two
turn
and
move
their
limb
,
as
if
trouble
by
some
unpleasant
dream
;
and
one
actually
go
through
the
motion
of
take
the
scalp

<EOS>
"warrior

of

"
I

the

each

spring
to
his

<EOS>
"Ugh

ejaculate
most
of
the

as
their
eye
fall
upon
the
speaker
,
while
the
grasp
upon
their

gradually
relax

they
stand
still

as

Moody

it

you

""does

"Are

<EOS>
"they

Moody

upon

and
each
turn
to
the
other
a
startled
look
of
inquiry

no

<EOS>
after
a
silence
of
perhaps
a
minute
,
the
one
who
have
first
address
Moody
,
rejoined:"will
<EOS>
my
brother
explain
?
<EOS>
or
do
danger
press?"As
Moody
apprehend
no
danger
himself
,
he
briefly
narrate
such
of
the
event
already
know
to
the
reader
as
he
think
most
likely
to
rouse
the
ire
of
his
swarthy
companion
,
and
induce
them
to
enter
into
his
plan
—
carefully
avoid
,
however
,
any
mention
of
Luther
,
who
be
know
personally
,
or
by
report
,
to
all
present
,
and
fear
as
a
Great
Medicine
,
to
contend
with
whom
would
be
useless
—
their
superstitious
fear
magnify
him
into
a
supernatural
being
,
directly
under
the
influence
and
guidance
of
the
Great
Spirit
.
<EOS>
"You
have
hear
,
"
say
Moody
,
in
conclusion
,
glance
round
upon
his
auditor
,
and
note
with
satisfaction
,
the
involuntary
tightening
of
their
hand
upon
their
rifle
,
the
gleaming
of
their
eye
,
and
the
dilating
of
their
mostril

the
only
sign

indicative
of
their
intense
interest
in

recital

<EOS>
no

after
a
silence
of
some
moment
,
Moody
resume
,
in
a
rather
impatient
tone:"I

posetha

be
dissatisfied

even

bring
out

so
accustomed

the

themselves
around

supersede
it
altogether
.
<EOS>
all
be
pleasant
and
serene
,
with
no
cloud
to
mar
the
broad
,
blue
canopy
above
.
<EOS>
a
heavy
dew
have
fall
during
the
night
,
and
be
now
repose
,
in
silvery
drop
,
upon
the
rock
,
and
the
leave
of
a
few
bush
which
grow
around
the
entrance
of
the
cave
,
and
overhang
the
stream
that
roar
and
foam
far
below
.
<EOS>
the
air
be
cool
and
brace
,
and
a
light
breeze
hore
to
the
ear
of
our
hero
the
song
of
several
warbler
,
which
have
commence
their
morning
's
roundelay
.
<EOS>
as
Clifton
stand
and
gaze
around
him
in
the
pale
light
,
and
see
the
beauty
of
the
morning
,
he
could
not
shake
off
a
feeling
of
sadness
that
have
take
possession
of
his
soul
.
<EOS>
the
event
of
the
already
depart
night
,
now
come
up
before
him
like
a
dream
.
<EOS>
His
mind
instantly
revert
to
the
strange
revelation
of
Luther
,
and
he
think
how
mysterious
be
the
way
of
Providence
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
Moody
be
his
brother?—and
<EOS>
if
so
,
how
wonderful
that
they
should
meet
as
foe
in
the
great
wilderness
!
<EOS>
Could
it
be
,
too
,
that
both
be
nobly
born!—and
if
so
,
how
singular
that
he
should
be
thus
leave
to
grow
up
in
ignorance
of
a
fact
so
important
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
true
,
he
feel
for
he
have
never
know
father
nor
mother
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
rear
and
educate
by
a
New
England
family
,
until
the
age
of
eighteen
,
when
he
have
be
tell
it
rest
with
him
to
choose
his
occupation
for
life
.
<EOS>
He
have
choose
the
army
,
and
have
be
place
in
a
military
school
;
since
when
,
by
the
aid
of
some
unknown
friend
,
he
have
be
advance
to
the
rank
and
station
he
now
hold
.
<EOS>
He
have
often
make
inquiry
concern
his
parent
,
but
could
never
learn
further
,
than
that
they
be
suppose
to
be
dead
,
and
that
he
be
indebte
for
all
his
favor
to
a
strange
benefactor
,
whom
he
have
never
see
,
and
perhaps
never
would
.
<EOS>
may
not
this
benefactor
be
Luther
?
<EOS>
He
have
let
fall
word
to
such
an
effect
,
by
state
that
he
know
him
before
he
know
himself
.
<EOS>
the
secret
be
doubtless
contain
in
the
silver
box
which
that
wonderful
being
have
place
in
his
hand
,
and
he
be
sorely
tempt
to
break
it
open
and
know
at
once
;
but
the
request
to
the
contrary
,
until
Kate
should
have
become
his
wife
,
restrain
him
.
<EOS>
who
be
Luther
?
<EOS>
and
how
do
he
manage
to
make
all
fear
him
,
and
bring
about
his
purpose
so
mysteriously
?
<EOS>
what
do
his
last
strange
word
portend
?
<EOS>
and
Moo
dy
,
too
—
if
he
be
indeed
his
brother
,
although
he
amply
merit
death
,
how
much
rather
he
would
have
have
him
live
,
perhaps
to
repent
and
reform
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
too
late
now
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
.
<EOS>
He
have
perish
by
the
hand
of
another
;
and
even
now
his
mutilated
remain
may
,
perchance
,
be
lay
on
the
rock
below
.
<EOS>
as
these
thought
pass
rapidly
through
the
mind
of
Clifton
,
he
approach
the
spot
where
Moody
be
last
see
by
the
party
at
the
cave
,
and
,
take
hold
of
some
stunt
bush
that
grow
upon
the
verge
of
the
chasm
,
endeavor
to
peer
down
into
the
gloomy
abyss
.
<EOS>
It
be
still
too
dark
to
see
aught
,
save
here
and
there
a
fire
-
flash
of
the
water
,
as
it
dash
over
the
rock
,
and
send
up
its
hollow
roar
;
and
Clifton
quickly
draw
back
,
with
a
shudder
.
<EOS>
as
he
do
so
,
a
soft
hand
be
lay
upon
his
arm
.
<EOS>
He
turn
,
and
beheld
the
idol
of
his
heart
,
the
lovely
Kate
Clarendon
,
stand
by
his
side
,
her
feature
pale
and
sad
,
and
her
eye
slightly
dim
by
a
pearly
tear
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
dear
,
"
exclaim
Ernest
,
throw
an
arm
around
,
and
draw
her
to
his
beat
heart
;
"
you
be
troubled
;
I
can
see
it
in
your
sweet
countenance
.
<EOS>
""I
be
think
of
my
dear
,
dear
mother
,
"
return
Kate
,
simply
;
and
unable
to
control
her
emotion
longer
,
she
bury
her
head
upon
the
breast
of
him
she
love
and
weep
freely
.
<EOS>
Clifton
be
move
,
and
it
be
sometime
ere
he
could
command
his
own
feeling
so
as
to
answer
calmly
.
<EOS>
"do
not
weep
,
dear
,
"
he
say
,
at
length
;
"
your
mother
be
now
an
angel
in
Heaven
.
<EOS>
""i
<EOS>
know
it
,
"
rejoin
Kate
,
with
a
fresh
burst
of
grief
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
well
off
now
,
than
when
in
this
cold
world
of
sorrow
;
but
then
it
be
so
hard
to
part
from
those
we
love
.
<EOS>
""It
be
,
indeed
,
"
return
Clifton
,
sadly
,
gaze
upon
her
with
a
look
of
affection
,
and
thinking
of
the
moment
when
he
may
be
call
to
part
from
her
,
or
she
from
him
,
by
the
same
woful
messenger
,
death
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
indeed
hard
to
part
from

Kate

God
send
the
time

far
distant
,
ere
it

the
trial
of
either
of
us
again

,
dear
Kate

"
he
pursue
,
consolingly
,
"
even
have
nature
take
its
course
,
you
would
soon
have
be
an
orphan
;
and
you
should
try
to
be
resign
,
that
your
mother
have
escape
all
the
anguish
of
a
linger
death
of
pain
.
<EOS>
though
horrible
,
her
death
be
easy
;
and
her
sweet
spirit
wing
its
flight
,
without
know
the
cause
that
separate
it
from
its
clayey
tenement
.
<EOS>
""i
<EOS>

try
to
be

"
Kate
reply
;
"
but
still
,
dear
Ernest
,
I
must
grieve
,
and
weep
,
for
I
be
only
a
poor
human
being
after
all

<EOS>
""in
<EOS>
that

what

right

Ernest
,
tenderly
;

<EOS>
tear
be
a
great
relief
to
the
overcharged
spirit
.
"
<EOS>
then
,
muse
for
a
moment
,
he
resume
:
"
I
,
too
,
feel
somewhat
sad
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
ponder
over
various
matter

at
the
moment
when
you
touch
my
arm
,
I
be
peer
down
the
chasm

expect
to
behold
my
brother
's
remain
—
but
it
be
too
dark

<EOS>
""O
,
do
not
call
him
brother
,
"
say
Kate
,
earnestly
;
do
not
,
dear
Ernest
!
<EOS>
for
he
be
everything
that
be
wicked
and
base
;
while
you
,
on
the
contrary
,
be
everything
that
be
noble
and
good

<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
can
not
be
brother

I
will
not
have
you
so
.
<EOS>
""i
do
not
know
,
"
reply
Clifton
,
musingly
,
;
"
it
be
all
very
mysterious
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
dark
man
,
it
be
true
—
a
terrible
man
—
a
man
,
in
fact
,
of
crime
and
blood
;
<EOS>
but
,
whatever
his
crime
,
he
be
now
most
probably
before
that
Great
Tribunal
,
where
he
will
have
to
answer
for
himself
,
and
be
judge
accordingly

<EOS>
I
ought
not
to
forgive
him
,

yet
my
heart
rather
yearn
to
do
so

<EOS>
I
see
him
last
night
in
my
dream
,
and
methought
he
have
repent
and
call
me
brother

<EOS>
I
awoke

sad

without

a
word

any

I
arise
and
come
hither

""I

for
when
the
sentinel

be
long
awake

I

you

indifferently

reply
the
other
;

for
,
between
my
hard
bed
and
ten
thousand
thought
that
come
crowd
one
after
another
upon
me
,
I
be
not
long
in
the
arm
of
Morpheus

<EOS>
"As
she
speak

toward
the
mouth
of

cave

Danvers

I
trust

ere
night

we
shall
once
more

safe

""Had
we
not
better
partake
of
some
refreshment
,

set
out
as
soon

ask
Danvers
,
in

<EOS>
"There
be
a
very
heavy
dew

answer
the
young
officer
,

and
the
bush
be
very
wet
;
so
that
perhaps
we
have
well
wait
until
the
sun
have
well
rise
.
<EOS>
I
think
we
shall
then
have
sufficient
time
;
for
although
Luther
lead
us
a
long
way
,
I
do
not
think
we
be
more
than
twenty

five

at

thirty

mile
from

,
for
one

I
be
anxious

you
any

inquire
Kate

rather
anxiously

I
do
not
know

"
reply
danver
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
most
probably
known
to
the
Indians
,
and
they
may
come
hither
in
search
of
Moody
—
which
result
,
to
say
the
least
,
would
be
unpleasant

musingly

You
be
right

him

David

that
a
man

should
resort
to
a

shallow

that

that

"David

hang
his

he
see
at

that
his
shallow
reasoning

hundred

this

their

that

along

it

Moody
have
such
a
narrow
escape

<EOS>
a

rock

which
here
jut
in

over

"Well

what
do
you

"
<EOS>
ask
Clifton
of

as
with
the
latter
he
venture
upon
the
rock

and
make
an
examination
with
his
eye
in

<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
I
think
we
han't
find
the
body
yet

"
reply
David
,
laconically
.
<EOS>
"True
<EOS>
;
but
do
not
you
see
there
be
no
chance
for
Moody
to
escape
with
life
.
<EOS>
the
rock
above
here
be
precipitious
and
slippery
,
so
that
it
be
impossible
he
should
have
ascend
them
,
even
if
he
escape
with
life
in
the
first
instance
;
and
certainly
no
sensible
man
would
contend
that
he
could
go
over
this
fall

not

dash
to
piece

<EOS>
"It
do
in

view
the
spot

stand

no

pass
the
cascade

survive
the
fall

for
the
pool
,
into
which
it
will
be
remember
Moody
descend
,
be
very
small
—
the
depth
they
could
not

and
entirely
surround
by
black
rock

on

much
of
the
water
fall
with
a
force
sufficient
to
throw
a
fine
spray

the
distance

<EOS>
We
can
only
account
for
this
small

deep

by

that

at

the

"don't

say
David
,
rather
doggedly
,
in
reply
to
Clifton
,
after
have
gaze
upon
the
spot
until
he
feel
satisfied
himself
that
the
young
officer
be
right
:
"
do
not

all
I

Clifton

this

satisfied

he

then
noiselessly
glide
away

,
with
his

companion
,
have
seek
out
a
convenient
cover
to
await

take
advantage

<EOS>
unlike
the

who
in

with

he

<EOS>
not

important
of

the
absence
of

which
he
have
learn
from

conversation

which
otherwise

have
disconcert
his

materially

<EOS>
as
soon
as
Unkee
be
go
,
and
he
have
see
the
party
of
Clifton
on
the
point
of
start
,
he
withdraw
from
his
place
of
concealment
,
and
move
along
the
ridge
of
the
hill
a
short
distance
,
descend
on
the
eastern
side
,
some
seventy
-
five
or
a
hundred
yard
,
or
until
he
come
to
a
small
cluster
of
bush
.
<EOS>
here
he
pause
for
a
moment
,
while
a
grim
smile
play
over
his
feature
—
and
then
part
the
bush
with
his
hand
,
he
expose
to
view
a
hole
of
some
two
foot
in
diameter
,
that
apparently
lead
deep
into
the
earth

<EOS>
without
stop
to
examine
this
,
Moody
throw
himself
flatwise
upon
the

soon
disappear
into
the
aperture

<EOS>
the
descent
of
the
hole
be
just
sufficient
to
render
his
movement
easy
,
and
in
less
than
two
minute
,
he
have
penetrate
the
hill
some
fifty
foot
.
<EOS>
here
the
aperture
gradually
enlarge

and
he
be
shortly
enable
to
crawl
along
upon
his

this

some
ten

the
superstitious
feeling
which
he
be
aware
pervade
the
mind
of
most
,
have
doubtless
visit
this
place
before
,
and
knowing
of
this
outlet
,
have
take
this
means
,
when
the
attention
of
each
be
draw
in
another
direction
,
to
leave
his
friend
in
his
usually
abrupt
and
mysterious
manner
.
<EOS>
have
he
not
know
of
this
outlet
,
it
be
hardly
probable
<EOS>
he
would
have
find
it
so
opportunely
;
for
be
in
a
distant
and
dark
corner
of
the
cave
,
ten
chance
to
one
<EOS>
but
it
have
be
completely
overlook
by
any
one
on
the
search
for
it
—
<EOS>
so
nicely
do
the
aperture
,
which
be
some
four
foot
above
the
floor
of
the
cave
,
blend
in
color
and
appearance
with
the
solid
rock
surround
it
.
<EOS>
how
this
become
known
to
both
Luther
and
Moody
,
will
perhaps
forever
remain
a
mystery
.
<EOS>
stop
at
this
aperture
or
window
—
as
,
from
its
shape
,
we
have
perhaps
more
appropriately
name
it
—
the
keen
eye
of
Moody
rove
around
the
dark
vault
,
in
search
of
Kate
and
the
gardener
,
neither
of
whom
have
as
yet
make
their
appearance
.
<EOS>
from
his
position
,
Moody
could
now
see
everything
in
the
cave
,
and
yet
himself
remain
unseen
.
<EOS>
this
be
owe
to
the
feeble
light
,
which
,
come
through
the
fissure
of
the
cave
,
be
sufficient
to
illume
somewhat
its
immediate
vicinity
,
but
insufficient
to
remove
the
dense
vail
of
darkness
behind
which
he
be
conceal
.
<EOS>
nearly
half
an
hour
elapse
,
and
Moody
be
become
impatient
,
when
voice
be
hear
,
and
presently
Kate
and
Ichabod
appear
,
enter
the
cave
from
the
large
and
more
usual
outlet
.
<EOS>
"O
,
the
torch
be
out
,
"
exclaim
Kate
,
as
she
come
in
view
of
the
interior
;
"
and
it
seem
so
dark
and
gloomy
here
—
let
us
go
back
,
Icha
.
<EOS>
""Better
<EOS>
stay
here
,
my
little
pet
,
until
they
come
back
,
"
answer
the
gardener
;
"
because
he
say
so
,
and
I
know
as
how
you
would
like
to
mind
him
;
and
besides
,
I
reckon
'
t
an't
burn
out
,
and
I
can
light
it
agin
in
a
minute
.
<EOS>
""Never
<EOS>
mind
,
Icha
;
I
can
soon
get
used
to
the
darkness
;
in
fact
,
I
can
see
a
little
now
;
and
it
be
well
,
perhaps
,
that
we
remain
conceal
,
in
case
anything
should
happen
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
,
I
hope
you
do
not
think
there
be
any
danger
,
my
little
pet
?
"
rejoin
Ichabod
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
no
,
I
hope
there
be
none
—
<EOS>
but
then
you
hear
what
David
say
.
<EOS>
""true
,
reply
Ichabod
,
who
be
strongly
inclined
to
believe
in
the
marvelous
:
"
<EOS>
true
,
Miss
Kate
,
I
heerd
what
he
say
,
and
it
make
me
feel
queer
at
the
time—'cause
<EOS>
I
remember
as
how
,
when
I
fire
,
the
smoke
take
the
shape
of
Luther
,
and
I
think
maybe
he
be
a
spirit
,
and
get
away
in
that
way
,
and
have
something
to
do
with
Moody
.
<EOS>
but
since
I
have
think
it
all
over
,
I
know
it
<EOS>
could'nt
<EOS>
ha
'
be
so
;
<EOS>
for
if
ever
I
shoot
any
body
in
my
life
,
it
be
that
same
infernal
scoundrel
Moody
.
<EOS>
""I
be
not
superstitious
,
Icha
,
"
answer
Kate
,
"
and
consequently
do
not
fear
the
interference
of
Luther
in
any
unnatural
manner
;
though
,
I
must
own
,
he
do
leave
here
mysteriously
;
but
then
,
in
all
probability
,
there
be
a
way
for
him
to
get
out
in
a
very
simple
manner
;
and
<EOS>
when
dear
ernest
return
(
Kate
do
not
fear
to
apply
endearing
epithet
before
the
simple
-
minded
gardener
)
,
I
intend
he
shall
search
the
cave
for
another
outlet
.
<EOS>
all
I
fear
be
,
that
Moody
may
,
somehow
,
have
manage
to
escape
alone
and
unaided
,
and
that
he
will
return
with
the
Indians
to
murder
or
make
us
prisoner
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
generally
miss
my
mark
,
"
say
Ichabod
,
in
reply
;
"
and
if
that
Necromancer
do
not
interfere
,
I
be
sartain
<EOS>
I
kill
him
—
just
as
sartain—""hark
!
<EOS>
"
interrupt
Kate
,
hold
up
her
plump
,
snowy
hand
,
and
bend
her
head
forward
in
a
listening
attitude
<EOS>
;
"
methought
I
hear
a
noise
.
<EOS>
""It
be
not
nothing
<EOS>
,
I
reckon
,
"
return
the
gardener
,
after
a
short
pause
,
during
which
he
have
listen
and
peer
cautiously
about
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
nothing
,
I
reckon
,
but
your
fear

<EOS>
I
have
often
get
skeere
the

way

when
I
have
be
alone

a
thinking
about

though
I
never

on't

<EOS>
well

as
I
be
a
saying
about
that
villain
Moody

I
know
I
kill
him
,
just
as
sartain
as—""i
kill
you
now

say
a
deep
voice
in
his
ear
;
and
at
the
same
moment
a
tremendous
blow
on
the
head
lay
the
gardener
senseless
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Kate
utter
a
terrible
scream

spring
back
in
real
terror

"Moody

she
shriek

can
the

give
up
its

triumphantly

scream

in

"spare

your

Moody

with
a
coarse
laugh

quickly
forward

grasp
her
by
the
arm

"villain

<EOS>
cry
Kate
,
terrified
and
indignant
.
"
<EOS>
unhand
me
,
and
begone

<EOS>
or
there
will
soon
be
those
here
to
make
you

""Never

my
pretty
one

I
be
perfectly
aware

Moody
,
with
another
coarse
laugh
;

as
for
your

what

Kate

breathlessly

as
the
other
pause

"they

exclaim
poor
Kate

bury
her
face
in

convulsively

Moody
now
release
his
hold

and
fold
his
arm
upon
his
breast

stand
,
for
some
moment

regard
his
terrified

in
stern
silence

time

dark
thought

concern
the
punishment

her
lover

through

these
moment
have
nigh
prove

regain
his
sense

and
perceive
how
matter

Ichabod

draw
his
knife
from
its
sheath
,
and
creep
up
stealthily
behind
Moody

act

plunge
it
into

all
at

quietly

in
Shawanoe:"Unkee

to

fierce
gleam

the
next
moment
his
countenance
assume
its

coolly

on

his
appearance
in

Kate

together
outside

for
,
as

they
do
not
immediately
enter
the

on
the
departure
of
Clifton

as

be
to

the
alarm

he
instantly
conceal
himself
where
he
could
secretly
watch
their
movement

<EOS>
He
have
see
them
enter
at
last

,
after
wait
what
he
conceive
to

to

with
a
grunt

as
much
as
to
say
,
"

next?"So
at

the

interpret
it
,
and
answered:"keep

sternly:"Come

gaze
upon

in
terror

from

his
wigwam

to

,
from
the
information
give
by
Unkee
,
have
anticipate
,
and
have
lay
their
plan
accordingly
.
<EOS>
as
the
white
approach
,
each
Indian
single
out
his
man
,
leave
two
of
their
party
in
readiness
to
close
in
,
in
case
any
one
should
meet
with
more
than
his
match
—
or
fire
upon
and
follow
the
fugitive
,
in
case
one
of
the
other
party
make
his
escape
.
<EOS>
at
a
preconcerte
signal
,
each
spring
forward
,
and
throw
his
arm
around
his
antagonist
,
secure
him
,
with
but
one
exception
,
without
a
single
blow
be
strike
in
defense
,
and
at
the
precise
moment
,
too
,
when
the
scream
of
Kate
announce
her
,
as
be
afterward
ascertain
,
a
prisoner
also
.
<EOS>
the
exception
allude
to
,
be
Clifton
.
<EOS>
quick
witted
,
and
possess
of
great
presence
of
mind
,
no
sooner
do
he
hear
the
yell
,
and
feel
his
arm
grasp
from
behind
,
than
,
comprehend
how
matter
be
,
he
make
a
feint
to
yield
,
which
throw
the
Indian
somewhat
off
his
guard
,
and
then
suddenly
bound
forward
,
clear
himself
of
his
captor
.
<EOS>
in
an
instant
the
tomahawk
of
the
savage
be
gleam
before
his
eye
,
and
the
next
moment
it
would
have
be
bury
in
his
skull
,
have
not
his
great
dexterity
again
save
him
.
<EOS>
draw
his
knife
,
bend
his
head
forward
,
and
spring
to
the
Indian
all
at
the
same
time
,
he
avoid
the
weapon
of
the
latter
,
which
strike
beyond
him
,
and
bury
his
own
in
the
heart
of
his
foe
.
<EOS>
the
Indian
utter
a
groan
,
and
sink
down
a
corpse
.
<EOS>
turn
as
quick
as
lightning
,
our
hero
see
the
two
other
rush
toward
him
,
weapon
in
hand
.
<EOS>
the
foremost
be
two
pace
in
advance
of
his
companion
;
and
hastily
draw
his
pistol
,
he
shoot
him
through
the
breast
.
<EOS>
there
be
only
one
leave
to
contend
with
—
for
the
rest
be
engage
in
master
the
white
,
who
,
perceive
his
successful
resistance
,
have
become
very
refractory
—
and
take
a
hasty
aim
with
his
other
pistol
,
the
young
officer
pull
the
trigger
.
<EOS>
a
flash
in
the
pan
save
the
life
of
his
adversary
;
and
the
next
moment
the
long
war
-
club
carry
by
Mugwa
lay
him
prostrate
on
the
earth
.
"Ugh
!
"
<EOS>
grunt
the
chief
,
as
he
bend
over
Clifton
to
secure
his
hand
,
speak
in
tolerable
English
;
"
great
warrior
—
make
good
Indian
;
"
and
instead
of
a
cloud
of
anger
,
the
face
of
this
savage
dis
play
an
expression
of
admiration
,
at
the
successful
daring
and
firmness
of
his
captive
.
<EOS>
for
a
minute
or
two
,
Clifton
lie
stun
by
the
blow
;
and
then
regain
his
sense
,
only
to
find
himself
and
friend
disarm
and
bind
,
with
their
hideous
captor
stand
around
,
and
gaze
upon
them
with
look
of
savage
exultation
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
he
think
of
Kate
,
and
his
anguish
may
be
better
imagine
than
describe
.
<EOS>
the
Indians
now
conduct
their
prisoner
out
of
the
thicket
,
and
select
a
spot
in
the
wood
,
a
few
yard
distant
,
where
there
chance
to
be
but
little
underbush
,
make
them
fast
,
each
to
a
separate
tree
,
and
then
collect
together
by
themselves
,
apparently
to
take
council
regard
their
next
proceeding
.
<EOS>
presently
four
of
the
party
repair
to
the
thicket
,
and
return
with
the
two
dead
body
—
the
indian
shot
by
Clifton
have
just
breathe
his
last
.
<EOS>
place
the
dead
upon
the
ground
,
side
by
side
,
the
whole
company
form
a
circle
round
them
,
and
take
hold
of
hand
,
commence
chant
word
wholly
unintelligible
to
our
friend
,
who
gaze
upon
them
with
a
sort
of
painful
curiosity
.
<EOS>
in
this
manner
some
five
minute
pass
,
without
a
word
be
speak
on
the
part
of
the
white
,
when
suddenly
David
call
out:"I
say
,
Lieutenant!""Well
?
"
answer
Clifton
.
<EOS>
"What
d
'
<EOS>
ye
think
about
the
business
now?""why
,
what
should
I
think?""do
n't
know

have
ye
conclude
that
Moody

live
yet?""Of
course
not
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
he
should
have
escape
the
peril
I
point
out
to
you
.
<EOS>
""well
,
then
,
all
I
have
get
to
say
be
,
that
his
ghost
be
get
a
powerful
flesh
and
blood
look
.
<EOS>
""Good
heaven
!
<EOS>
what
do
you
mean
,
David
?
<EOS>
"
cry
Clifton
,
quickly
,
while
every
one
turn
his
head
—
the
only
part
of
his
person
now
at
liberty
—
toward
the
scout
,
anxious
for
an
explanation
of
his
startling
word
.
<EOS>
David
reply
only
by
nod
his
head
mysteriously
,
in
a
certain
direction
;
and
follow
that
direction
with
their
eye
,
the
face
of
all
suddenly
blanch
,
and
each
tongue
utter
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
alarm
.
<EOS>
within
full
view
appear
Moody
,
approach
the
Indians
,
lead
Kate
by
the
hand
,
and
follow
by
Unkee
and
the
gardener
.
<EOS>
"good
God
!
"
groan
Clifton
,
"
can
it
be
possible
that
my
eye
do
not
deceive
me
—
that
Moody
be
still
live
—
and
Kate
,
sweet
Kate
,
again
in
his
power!""'spect
if
you
do
not
believe
your
eye
,
you
will
soon
have
some
other
sense
that
will
give
you
a
powerful
inclination
that
way
,
"
remark
David
,
rather
drily
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
not
understand
the
affair
,
"
say
danver
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
something
very
mysterious
in
his
escape
.
<EOS>
""i
<EOS>
jest
believe
it
be
the
devil
's
work
,
"
observe
another
;
"
and
that
be
the
reason
Icha
's
ball
would
not
kill
.
<EOS>
if
ever
I
git
a
chance
at
him
,
I
will
put
in
some
silver
slug
,
and
try
the
virtue
of
them
.
<EOS>
"while
<EOS>
such
and
similar
remark
be
pass
among
the
white
,
Moody
and
his
party
approach
the
Indians
.
<EOS>
as
he
come
up
,
they
make
a
halt
in
their
ceremony
,
and
utter
grunt
of
approbation
at
his
success
,
open
the
ring
for
him
to
enter
.
<EOS>
as
Kate
,
whom
he
still
hold
by
the
hand
,
come
suddenly
upon
the
dead
and
bloody
body
of
the
Indians
,
slay
by
the
hand
of
her
lover
,
she
give
an
involuntary
start
,
and
utter
a
slight
exclamation
of
horror
.
<EOS>
Moody
seem
take
equally
by
surprise
,
for
his
feature
slightly
pale
,
and
he
turn
his
face
quickly
toward
the
chief
with
a
look
of
inquiry
.
<EOS>
with
Unkee
,
however
,
it
be
different
.
<EOS>
He
be
an
Indian
out
and
out
,
and
have
be
teach
to
school
his
feeling
and
passion
,
so
as
not
to
betray
surprise
at
any
thing
—
a
custom
which
be
hold
by
the
savage
to
be
a
great
virtue
.
<EOS>
as
he
come
up
to
his
dead
companion
,
therefore
,
he
look
down
upon
them
calmly
,
without
change
a
muscle
,
as
though
it
be
the
most
common
-
place
sight
in
the
world
,
and
one
he
have
expect
to
behold
.
<EOS>
"Who
have
do
this
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Moody
,
in
the
indian
dialect
,
after
wait
a
sufficient
time
for
Mugwa
to
make
an
opening
remark
.
<EOS>
"The
chief
of
the
pale
-
face
,
"
reply
the
latter
.
<EOS>
a
sudden
gleam
of
ferocity
now
shoot
athwart
the
dark
feature
of
the
questioner
,
and
lay
his
hand
upon
a
weapon
in
his
belt
,
he
rejoin
,
quickly:"Then
he
must
die
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
my
brother
be
not
hasty
,
"
return
Mugwa
;
"
for
the
fate
of
all
must
be
decide
by
council
.
<EOS>
if
the
pale
-
face
chief
be
doom
to
die
,
it
must
not
be
by
the
tomahawk
.
<EOS>
""true
,
chief
<EOS>
,
"
answer
Moody
,
with
a
grim
smile
,
"
I
have
nigh
forget
your
pleasant
indian
custom
of
the
stake
and
torture
.
<EOS>
""Mugwa
<EOS>
deem
him
worthy
of
them
all
,
"
pursue
the
chief
;
"
for
he
be
a
great
brave
,
and
no
indian
warrior
could
have
do
more
.
<EOS>
the
chief
of
the
Piquas
could
almost
call
him
brother
,
too
.
<EOS>
"This
be
allude
in
a
rather
obscure
manner
to
the
design
which
have
previously
enter
the
head
of
the
"
Bear
,
"
of
make
an
Indian
of
Clifton
,
and
be
thus
throw
out
as
a
sort
of
feeler
,
to
learn
the
impression
it
would
produce
upon
Moody
.
<EOS>
as
he
hear
it
,
the
outcast
start
,
and
exclaim
vehemently:"No
,
Mugwa
,
he
must
die
!
"
<EOS>
the
next
moment
a
new
idea
take
possession
of
his
brain
,
and
he
add
,
immediately
,
in
a
low
tone—"that
be
,
perhaps
<EOS>
;
I
will
see
;
I
will
consider
,
Mugwa
.
<EOS>
but
go
on
with
your
ceremony
.
<EOS>
I
would
join
you
,
only
that
I
have
important
matter
to
which
I
must
attend
;
and
turn
away
abruptly
<EOS>
,
he
lead
Kate
out
of
the
circle
,
and
some
distance
apart
from
all
.
<EOS>
"You
have
see
,
"
he
begin
,
address
himself
to
our
heroine
,
and
nod
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
circle
of
savage
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
,
"
answer
Kate
calmly
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
you
still
see
,
"
pursue
Moody
,
point
his
finger
in
the
opposite
direction
,
and
toward
the
captive
.
<EOS>
Kate
follow
the
motion
with
her
eye
,
and
,
for
the
first
time
,
become
aware
of
the
capture
of
her
friend
—
of
the
complete
triumph
of
her
foe
—
and
in
a
moment
her
heart
sink
,
her
feature
grow
deadly
pale
,
a
sudden
nervous
weakness
seize
her
,
and
,
but
for
the
support
of
Moody
,
she
would
have
fall
to
the
earth
.
<EOS>
find
the
Indians
by
themselves
,
around
the
dead
body
of
their
late
comrade
,
and
no
new
scalp
at
their
belt
,
Kate
have
believe
that
a
skirmish
have
ensue
in
which
her
friend
have
be
victorious
,
and
that
she
may
look
for
a
rescue
at
any
moment
.
<EOS>
but
now
the
case
be
different
;
the
horrible
reality
have
break
upon
her
like
a
thunder
-
bolt
;
they
be
all
prisoner
—
reserve
perhaps
for
the
torture
—
and
all
in
the
power
of
the
archdemon
by
her
side
,
from
whom
she
could
hope
for
no
mercy
.
<EOS>
Moody
watch
the
painful
expression
of
her
lovely
countenance
with
a
grim
smile
of
satisfaction
;
and
after
wait
till
she
have
somewhat
recover
her
composure
,
he
resumed:"You
see
I
be
now
master
of
all
.
<EOS>
be
you
in
the
infernal
region
of
the
damned
,
you
would
not
be
more
fully
in
the
power
of
the
arch
-
fiend
,
than
you
and
your
friend
be
now
in
mine
.
<EOS>
""I
be
aware
of
that
,
"
reply
Kate
.
"
<EOS>
and
more
<EOS>
—
I
think
the
comparison
aptly
make
.
<EOS>
""That
may
or
may
not
be
,
as
matter
turn
out
,
"
rejoin
Moody
,
drily
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
lead
you
hither
,
away
from
the
other

to
tell
you
something
of
importance
,
regard
yourself

friend
,
and
from
your
reply
to
take
my
cue
of
conduct

<EOS>
""Say
<EOS>
on

return
Kate

<EOS>
"You
notice
those
dead
bodies?""I
do

<EOS>
""They

accord
to
old
Luther

once
brother

"Again
<EOS>
Kate
tremble
,
her
feature
grow
deadly
pale
,
and
she
fairly
gasp
for
breath

<EOS>
"well

I

you

resume
Moody
,
after
another
short
pause
;
"
and
I
be
glad
you
do
,
as
it
will
save
me
much
circumlocution
in
my
remark

<EOS>
now
mark
my
word

<EOS>
as
soon
as
you

of
the
Indians
be
over

their
dead
be
bury
from
their
sight

they
will
proceed
to
hold
council
,
regard
the
disposal
of
their
prisoner
.
<EOS>
now
you
know
something
of
indian
nature
—
or
ought
to
,
at
least
—
and
be
doubtless
well
aware
that
,
when
they
be
angry
,
they
be
not
altogether
the
most
mild
and
placid
creature
which
the
world
have
ever
produce
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
their
custom
be
somewhat
rough
—
particularly
when
they
decide
on
put
a
captive
through
the
interesting
ceremony
of
be
roast
alive
by
a
slow
fire
,
with
various
little
et
cetera
,
in
the
way
of
amusement
—
such
as
shoot
powder
into
his
naked
body
—
fill
the
flesh
with
resinous
splinter
and
set
fire
to
them
—
cut
off
his
ear

tongue
—
punch
out
his
eye

Kate
,
cover
her
face
,

shudder
with
horror

at
the
terrible
picture
of
torture
draw
by
the
outcast

merely
wish
you
to
comprehend
the
matter

full
force

pursue
Moody
;

as
I
perceive
you
do
—
why

I
will
sketch
no
further

now

be
guilty

a
certain
breach

Moody
speak
in
an
ironical
tone
)
,
namely
,
kill
two
Indians
,
after
be
seize
as
a
prisoner
himself

it
be
more
than
probable
that
they
,
on
trial
,
will
sentence
him
to
the
interesting
little
proceeding
I
just
mention
,

at
which
you
think
proper

turn
away
your

holy
horror

"Ah
!

now
you
speak
to
the
point

Moody

with
a
grim
smile

I
will
answer
you

<EOS>
in
the

know
that

assuredly
be
condemn
to
the
torture

I
will

<EOS>
to

day
I
make
you
this
proposal

yesterday
I
would
have
scorn

in
the

my
passion

call
it
which
you
will

for
you

<EOS>
do
not
decide
hastily

<EOS>
I
will
give
you
a
few
minute
,
alone
,
to
think
upon
it
;
but
if
you
decide
in
my
favor
,
one
thing
you
must
bear
in
mind
:
You
will
have
to
swear
,
by
all
your
hope
of
salvation
hereafter
—
by
all
you
love
and
hold
sacred
—
by
everything
,
in
fact
,
that
can
make
your
oath
bind
—
that
you
will
be
mine
,
rescue
or
no
rescue
;
that
,
in
short
,
come
what
will
,
you
will
follow
me
and
my
fortune
through
life
,
and
that
,
in
the
event
of
your
breaking
this
oath
,
you
solemnly
pray
the
ruler
of
the
universe
to
condemn
you
to
eternal
torment
in
the
world
to
come

I

you

I
venture
to
say
you
be
not
an
exception
to
this
rule

<EOS>
in
consideration
of
this
,
I
have
be
make
some
proposal
to
yonder
fair
maiden

,
if
she
accept
,
I
trust
,
by
my
influence

to
save
yours

it
have
be
forfeit

two
of
my

""Ha

<EOS>
well
,
what
do
you
propose
?
<EOS>
"
ask
Clifton

quickly

"Why
,
dear
brother
—
and
in
consideration
that
you
be
my
brother
—
which
I
verily
believe
,
otherwise
you
could
not
be
so
good
and
amiable
—
as
I
wish
to
have
no
secret
that
you
can
not
share
with
me
,
I
will
tell
you
.
<EOS>
know
then
,
and
therefore
,
that
my
former
passion
for
yonder
fair
maiden
—
which
I
believe
be
antecedent
to
yours
,
and
consequently
righteous
by
priority
—
have
again
revive
in
a
wonderful
degree
,
and
I
be
extremely
anxious
to
call
her
mine
by
marriage
.
<EOS>
now
as
an
inducement
for
her
to
take
this
step
—
to
yield
her
consent
freely
,
and
espouse
me
through
life
as
her
lawful
husband
—
I
have
promise
to
save
your
life
,
and
set
you
free

proud
indignation

Clifton
utter
these
word

in
a
fierce
,
loud
tone

which
distinctly
reach
Kate
,
rouse
her
from
her
revery
,
and
decide
her
course
of
action

Moody
start
,
a
terrible
expression
pass
over
his
countenance

eye
gleam
like
an
angry
serpent

instinctively

hand
seek
a
weapon
in
his
belt

<EOS>
the
next
moment
,
by
a
sudden
and
powerful
effort
,
he
partially
succeed
in
suppress
this
show
of
passion
,
and
resume
his
former
hypocritical
look
and
can
not
.
<EOS>
We
say
partially
;
for
so
much
of
passion

mingle
with
the
effort

appear
perfectly
serene

unmoved

as
to
render
his
appearance
somewhat
ridiculous

"You
<EOS>
forget

with
something

sneer

a
smile

that
the

I
assure
you
will
be
yours

be
not

easy
imaginable

you

<EOS>
besides
,
it
be
a
dreadful
thing
to
die
so
young

with
such
brilliant
prospect

I

by
your

you

already

to
have
your

scatter

simply
for

torture

only
to
that
of
the
stake
—
when
the
whole
party
of
savage
,
Moody
on
the
lead
,
be
see
approach
them
.
<EOS>
as
the
Indians
near
the
prisoner
,
the
latter
could
discover
—
by
the
dark
,
angry
,
sinister
look
of
all
—
that
mercy
,
that
diviner
attribute
of
the
brave
and
good
,
form
no
part
of
their
rude
and
barbarous
creed
.
<EOS>
when
they
have
attain
a
close
vicinity
to
their
captive
,
they
come
to
a
halt
,
and
for
a
moment
gaze
around
with
savage
ferocity
.
<EOS>
without
go
near
,
or
say
a
word
to
any
of
the
white
,
who
stand
regard
them
in
gloomy
silence
,
they
begin
to
collect
some
dry
stick
,
which
they
throw
into
a
pile
and
set
on
fire
.
<EOS>
then
seat
themselves
around
it
,
the
pipe
,
the
unfailing
accompaniment
of
an
indian
council
,
be
produce
and
light
,
and
pass
around
the
circle
as
on
the
occasion
previously
describe
.
<EOS>
when
this
part
of
the
ceremony
be
over
,
Moody
arise
and
said:"brother
,
when
last
we
meet
in
council
,
it
be
at
the
request
of
him
who
now
address
you
.
<EOS>
He
then
tell
you
a
good
tale
,
which
you
yourself
have
prove
to
be
true
.
<EOS>
He
tell
you
,
that
many
scalp
or
many
prisoner
be
on
the
southern
path
.
<EOS>
You
believe
him
,
and
you
turn
back
;
for
the
rest
,
look
around
you
.
<EOS>
"Here
<EOS>
he
pause
,
and
slowly
point
to
each
of
the
prisoner
,
individually
,
begin
with
Clifton
,
and
end
with
the
gardener
,
who
now
stand
bind
to
a
tree
,
some
distance
from
the
other
,
his
indian
captor
have
join
the
council
.
<EOS>
when
do
,
Moody
resumed:"brother
,
behold
your
triumph
!
<EOS>
there
they
stand
,
bind
captive
.
<EOS>
in
all
,
Posetha
count
nine
head
,
or
nine
scalp

<EOS>
He
look
around
this
circle
,
and
,
include
himself
,
can
only
count
nine
warrior
.
<EOS>
there
be
two
more
when
his
red
brother
turn
back
.
<EOS>
where
be
they
now
?
<EOS>
in
the
Indian
's
Heaven
.
<EOS>
who
send
them
there
before
their
time
?
<EOS>
yonder
pale
-
face
chief
.
<EOS>
posetha
think
this
enough
.
<EOS>
He
should
die
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
long
enough
upon
the
war
-
path
,
and
he
should
die
.
<EOS>
the
shoulder
of
Posetha
pain
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
wound
.
<EOS>
who
do
it
?
<EOS>
yonder
miscreant
(
point
to
the
gardener
)
.
<EOS>
three
time
have
yonder
wretch
seek
Posetha
's
life
.
<EOS>
He
still
live
to
boast
it
.
<EOS>
posetha
think
he
should
die
also
.
<EOS>
this
will
make
his
party
the
strong
.
<EOS>
otherwise
,
there
will
be
a
pale
-
face
to
every
red
-
man
.
<EOS>
there
will
still
be
leave
enough
to
amuse
the
young
man
,
the
squaw
and
pappose
of
the
Indians
.
<EOS>
posetha
give
his
voice
for
the
speedy
torture
of
the
two
he
have
name
.
<EOS>
His
ear
be
open
to
hear
their
cry
for
mercy
.
<EOS>
His
heart
be
shut
to
that
mercy
.
<EOS>
It
will
please
him
.
<EOS>
It
will
please
the
Great
Spirit
.
<EOS>
brother
,
Posetha
have
speak
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
a
ready
tact
,
peculiar
to
his
nature
<EOS>
Moody
have
learn
to
adapt
himself
to
the
manner
and
mode
of
speak
of
the
Indians
.
<EOS>
when
harrangue
in
council
unlike
his
usual
method
in
English
,
he
make
his
sentence
simple
and
short
,
and
speak
directly
to
the
point
.
<EOS>
His
indian
dialect
be
not
speak
with
ease
,
nor
very
fluently
;
but
,
with
short
sentence
,
he
always
manage
to
make
himself
distinctly
understand
.
<EOS>
as
he
take
his
seat
upon
the
ground
he
run
his
eye
around
the
circle
,
and
perceive
,
by
their
look
of
ferocity
,
their
flashing
eye
,
that
his
sentiment
be
echo
in
the
breast
of
nearly
every
savage
.
<EOS>
We
say
nearly
—
we
may
say
all
with
the
exception
of
Mugwa
,
the
chief
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
recollect
,
that
the
bravery
of
Clifton
,
even
in
slay
a
part
of
his
band
,
have
win
his
admiration
;
and
a
design
of
save
his
life
,
of
transform
him
into
an
Indian
,
have
then
enter
his
head
,
and
have
not
yet
be
eradicate
.
<EOS>
with
regard
to
the
other
,
he
be
ready
to
give
his
voice
for
death
;
but
Clifton
,
from
some
strange
fancy
,
he
wish
spare
.
<EOS>
Moody
see
at
a
glance
,
that
on
this
point
he
would
meet
with
decide
opposition
;
but
he
trust
to
a
majority
in
his
favor
to
carry
the
day
.
<EOS>
Mugwa
be
the
next
to
speak
.
<EOS>
slowly
,
with
dignity
,
he
rise
,
and
gaze
round
upon
the
circle
of
warrior
,
whom
he
see
be
all
attention
,
at
length
begin
.
<EOS>
"brother
,
"
he
say
,
"
you
have
hear
the
word
of
Posetha
.
<EOS>
to
Mugwa
they
seem
wise
,
and
not
wise
.
<EOS>
wise
,
when
they
tell
us
we
must
make
our
party
the
strong
—
not
wise
when
they
bid
us
sacrifice
the
pale
-
face
chief
.
<EOS>
"Here
<EOS>
Mugwa
,
although
no
one
interrupt
him
,
see
by
the
change
in
the
countenance
of
his
hearer
,
that
he
have
touch
upon
an
unpopular
theme
;
but
nothing
daunt
,
he
go
on
.
<EOS>
"True
,
he
continue
,
"
he
have
slay
two
of
my
brave
,
and
menace
the
life
of
Mugwa
himself
—
but
<EOS>
be
not
this
do
in
his
own
defense
?
<EOS>
who
can
blame
him
?
<EOS>
what
warrior
among
you
do
not
admire
bravery
?
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
virtue
.
<EOS>
It
come
directly
from
the
Great
Spirit
.
<EOS>
have
he
turn
like
a
coward
to
fly
,
Mugwa
would
have
send
a
ball
to
bid
him
tarry
.
<EOS>
Mugwa
would
ere
this
have
have
his
scalp
dry
on
his
belt
and
the
wolf
should
have
fatten
on
his
carcass
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
do
this
,
though
surround
by
enemy
he
know
he
could
not
conquer
.
<EOS>
He
act
the
hero
and
the
man
.
<EOS>
mugwa
admire
heroism
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
a
great
many
moon
upon
the
war
-
path
.
<EOS>
His
own
hand
have
slay
a
great
many
pale

face
.
<EOS>
He
be
brave
.
<EOS>
He
be
their
enemy
.
<EOS>
the
proof
of
both
be
in
his
lodge
.
<EOS>
who
think
mugwa
boast
without
cause
—
that
his
tongue
be
fork
—
can
go
there
and
see
.
<EOS>
mugwa
love
a
hero
,
be
he
redman
or
pale

face
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
thing
to
be
brave
.
<EOS>
yonder
pale
-
face
chief
be
brave
.
<EOS>
Mugwa
would
not
see
him
bind
to
the
stake
,
and
die
like
a
dog
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
squaw
in

<EOS>
there
be
squaw
in
his
follower

<EOS>
take
them
.
<EOS>
there
be
enough
and
to
spare
.
<EOS>
mugwa
be
willing
.
<EOS>
but
why
select
the
brave
?
<EOS>
why
select
him
who
fear
not
death
?
<EOS>
mugwa
do
not
ask
to
set
him
free
.
<EOS>
He
would
take
him
home
to
his
nation
,
and
let
them
decide
.
<EOS>
He
would
in
short
make
him
an
Indian
.
<EOS>
He
be
worthy
to
be
an
Indian
.
<EOS>
He
would
teach
our
young
man
courage
—
our
warrior
wisdom
.
<EOS>
spare
him
,
and
Mugwa
sanction
all
the
rest

<EOS>
He
have
speak
.
<EOS>
"Here
<EOS>
the
chief
gravely
take
his
seat
,
amid
a
profound
silence
.
<EOS>
It
be
evident
to
Moody
,
who
watch
the
face
of
all
attentively
,
that
the
argument
of
the
Bear
have
make
a
deep
impression
upon
their
mind
,
and
that
the
scale
would
assuredly
turn
against
him
,
unless
the
weight
of
the
next
speaker
's
argument
be
throw
in
his
favor
.
<EOS>
with
some
anxiety
,
therefore
,
he
wait
the
rise
of
the
next
orator
.
<EOS>
on
him
,
doubtless
,
would
depend
the
triumph
of
himself
or
Mugwa
.
<EOS>
at
length
Unkee
start
to
his
foot
,
and
Moody
at
once
feel
satisfied
by
the
gleam
of
his
eye
,
that
he
would
side
with
him
,
and
thus
his
triumph
would
be
complete
.
<EOS>
nor
be
he
mistaken
.
"brother
<EOS>
,
"
begin
Unkee
,
"
you
have
hear
.
<EOS>
the
word
of
the
great
chiefs
have
find
your
ear
open
.
<EOS>
They
have
enter
your
brain
,
and
,
not
be
alike
,
have
become
confused
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
which
have
speak
most
wise
.
<EOS>
You
wish
to
hear
the
opinion
of
another
before
you
decide
.
<EOS>
Unkee
will
give
you
his
.
<EOS>
Unkee
be
not
an
orator
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
of
many
word
.
<EOS>
He
be
more
for
action
.
<EOS>
hear
his
counsel
.
<EOS>
the
pale
-
face
be
many
—
the
red

man
be
few
.
<EOS>
unless
the
red

man
destroy
the
pale

face
,
he
will
over

run
him
.
<EOS>
all
should
die
.
<EOS>
the
voice
of
Unkee
join
Posetha
's
.
<EOS>
the
pale
-
face
chief
should
die
now
.
<EOS>
first
,
because
he
be
brave
,
and
the
more
to
be
fear
.
<EOS>
secondly
,
because
the
spirit
of
our
friend
call
for
his
blood
.
<EOS>
They
can
not
rest
in
peace
,
know
their
murderer
fill
their
wigwam
.
<EOS>
"This
<EOS>
last
be
an
argument
so
forcible
,
so
conclusive
to
an
indian
mind
,
that
nothing
but
the
mighty
force
of
habit
,
restrain
the
dark
warrior
from

the
speaker
with
fierce
yell
of
coin
ciding
opinion
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
their
face
instantly
grow
savagely
ferocious
;
their
eye
gleam
like
ball
of
fire
;
their
nostril
expand
,
and
their
hand
nervously
clutch
their
weapon
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
complete
triumph
.
<EOS>
a
thousand
word
could
not
add
to
or
destroy
the
force
of
that
single
,
simple
sentence
.
<EOS>
even
Mugwa
seem
astonished
and
take
aback
,
as
though
the
idea
be
new
,
and
have
strike
him
,
too
,
with
force
.
<EOS>
Moody
,
with
a
thrill
of
savage
joy
,
now
see
that
his
end
be
gain
.
<EOS>
a
direct
Providence
could
alone
save
the
victim
of
his
hate
from
their
impending
doom
.
<EOS>
Unkee
,
too
,
see
that
the
effect
he
seek
be
work
,
and
he
be
cunne
enough
to
pause
and
give
it
full
sway
.
<EOS>
simply
add
,
"
Unkee
have
speak
,
"
he
resume
his
seat
.
<EOS>
no
sooner
do
the
savage
perceive
that
he
be
do
,
than
spring
to
their
foot
,
they
utter
the
most
terrific
yell
imaginable
—
yell
which
go
to
the
heart
of
the
prisoner
,
and
tell
them
,
alas
!
<EOS>
to
fear
the
bad
.
<EOS>
as
for
Moody
,
he
fairly
shout
with
ferocious
delight
,
and
dance
around
in
a
wild
ecstasy
of
joy
.
<EOS>
revenge
he
feel
be
in
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
at
length
the
yell
and
rapid
gesticulation
of
the
savage
subside
,
after
which
several
minute
be
occupy
in
settle
the
time
and
place
where
the
horrid
rite
should
come
off
,
and
the
manner
in
which
it
should
be
conduct
.
<EOS>
after
some
discussion
in
the
indian
fashion
,
it
be
finally
agree
that
Clifton
and
Ichabod
should
be
put
to
the
torture
on
the
very
ground
where
the
council
have
be
hold
which
have
decree
them
to
death
,
and
in
full

of
all
the
prisoner
,
who
would
thereby
be
witness
of
what
,
sooner
or
later
,
they
would
have
to
undergo
themselves
.
<EOS>
this
suit
the
purpose
of
Moody
exactly
;
and
while
the
Indians
set
about
prepare
for
the
work
of
death
,
he
repair
to
Clifton
,
to
let
him
know
the
result
,
taunt
him
all
he
could
,
and
,
in
fact
,
enjoy
to
the
full
his
own
hellish
triumph
.
<EOS>
"I
have
come
,
my
dear
brother

"
he
say
,
ironically
,
"
to
inform
you
what
my
friend
propose
to
do
for
your

<EOS>
perhaps
,
however

you

for

""i

pale

<EOS>
"well
,
you
have
make
a
very
good
guess
,
for
the
first
one

"
reply
Moody
,
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
about
to
reap
the
benefit
of
your
obstinacy
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
""do
your

rejoin
Clifton
;

for
sooner

I
die

sacrifice
the
happiness
of
yonder
maiden

<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
what

you

<EOS>
strange
fancy
you
have

one
which
I
will
now
remove

""well

what

whether

my
lawful
wife

<EOS>
I
can
not
compel
her
to
marry
me

it
be
true

I
can
compel
her
to
do
bad

<EOS>
""Good

God
!
<EOS>
Moody
,
what
do
you
mean

cry
Clifton
,
as
a
vague
suspicion
of
something
terrible
cross
his
mind

<EOS>
"I
leave
you
to
judge
what
I
mean

for
the
present
,
as
I
see
a
warrior
come
to
prepare
you
for
the
trial
that
await
you

answer
Moody
.
<EOS>
"
when
you
be
burn
at
the
stake

and
your
flesh
crack
with
the
heat

I
will
come

hiss
my

"saye
<EOS>
this
Moody
turn
upon
his
heel
and
strode
away
toward
Kate
,
while
the
savage
approach
,
and
simply
give
a
grunt
,
draw
his
knife
and
cut
the
thong

without

He

note
by
the
friend
of
Clifton
,
with
feeling
peculiar
to
each
,
but
which
it
would
be
impossible
for
us
to
describe
.
<EOS>
Meantime
Moody
approach
Kate
,
who
stand
bind
to
the
tree
,
her
feature
pale
as
death
,
and
a
look
of
alarmed
inquiry
upon
her
sweet
countenance
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
"
say
the
outcast
,
come
up
,
a
dark
smile
play
over
his
sinister
feature
,
"
you
be
now
about
to
experience
the
result
of
your
decision
.
<EOS>
look
yonder
,
and
yon
,
"
and
he
point
first
toward
Clifton
,
and
then
toward
the
savage
,
who
be
in
the
act
of
drive
a
large
stake
deep
into
the
earth
.
<EOS>
"what
mean
these
fearful
sign
?
"
ask
Kate
,
breathlessly
.
<EOS>
"Their
<EOS>
meaning
,
methinks
,
be
very
apparent
,
"
answer
Moody
.
<EOS>
"
Your
lover
be
about
to
pass
the
ordeal
of
fire
,
on
a
journey
from
which
he
will
never
return

<EOS>
""Oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
Moody
,
you
can
not
be
so
base
—
so
cruel
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Kate
,
in
terrible
agony
,
little
heeding
that
she
may
as
well
have
attempt
to
move
a
savage
to
tear
,
<EOS>
as
him
she
address
to
mercy
.
<EOS>
—
"
oh

save
him

<EOS>
save
him!—he
be
your
brother!""not
if
he
be
ten
time
my
brother

and
it
be
in
my
power

"
return
Moody
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
You
plead
too
late
,
Kate
Clarendon
.
<EOS>
once
I
seek
to
save
him
,
on
the
easy
condition
that
you
become
my
wife
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
of
the
consequence
,
if
you
refuse
,
and
yet
refuse
you
do
.
<EOS>
His
doom
be
now
past
recall
.
<EOS>
He
must
die
.
<EOS>
and
you
,
"
add
Moody
,
tauntingly
,
"
<EOS>
and
you
,
pretty
Miss
Kate
—
do
not
think
by
this
that
you
will
escape
me
!
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
I
swear
to
you
your
doom
shall
be
no
well

his!"Kate
shut
her
eye
and
groan
.
<EOS>
"One
thing
,
"
she
cry
,
suddenly
,
"
do
me
one
favor
,
and
I
will
ask
no
more
!
<EOS>
do
not
let
him
writhe
at
the
stake
!
<EOS>
in
mercy
take
your
rifle
,
and
—
and—(she
pause
,
and
shudder
,
and
her
voice
sink
to
an
almost
inaudible
whisper
)
—
and
—
end
—
his
—
misery
,
"
she
gasp
,
at
last
with
a
groan
.
<EOS>
"Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
laugh
Moody
,
"
you
must
have
a
very
poor
opinion
of
me
,
to
think
I
would
condescend
to
save
him
from
his
red
friend
yonder
;
"
and
again
he
point
toward
the
savage
.
<EOS>
"farewell
,
dear
!
"
say
a
deep
,
solemn
voice
at
this
moment
,
that
make
the
blood
retreat
to
the
heart
of
Kate
,
leave
her
pale
,
agonized
feature
bloodless
;
and
look
round
<EOS>
,
she
see
her
lover
be
lead
to
his
place
of
torture
.
<EOS>
"
farewell
,
dear
!
"
<EOS>
again
speak
Ernest
,
in
solemn
tone
.
<EOS>
"
on
earth
we
may
never
meet
again
;
but
in
God
put
your
trust
,
and
meet
me
soon
in
the
land
of
spirits!"Kate
could
hear
no
more
,
but
utter
one
fearful
scream
of
anguish
,
that
penetrate
the
heart
of
all
her
friend
,
and
make
the
brave
young
officer
tremble
as
a
child
.
<EOS>
"You
see
!
"
say
Moody
,
coolly
,
point
toward
the
already
retreat
form
of
Clifton
,
as
his
indian
conductor
hurry
him
forward
:
<EOS>
"
You
see!"But
he
be
mistaken
;
Kate
do
not
see
;
she
have
faint
;
and
with
a
deep
malediction
on
her
tender
heart
,
Moody
turn
away
,
and
strode
on
after
his
intend
victim
.
<EOS>
by
the
time
that
he
have
come
up
to
the
Indians
,
the
driving
of
the
stake
be
complete
,
and
the
savage
be
already
place
stick
around
it.—These
be
put
end
-
wise
to
the
stake
,
some
three
foot
distant
,
so
as
to
form
a
complete
circle
,
and
give
the
condemn
the
benefit
of
a
slow
fire
.
<EOS>
to
the
stake
the
prisoner
be
to
be
bind
,
so
as
to
leave
him
a
little
freedom
,
and
then
the
stick
be
to
be
fire
.
<EOS>
Clifton
,
as
he
near
the
spot
,
notice
all
these
preparation
with
a
shudder
,
and
with
a
sink
spirit
;
but
nerve
himself
with
as
much
stoicism
as
he
could
assume
,
he
in
wardly
call
upon
his
maker
to
aid
him
,
and
prepare
himself
to
undergo
the
trial
before
him
with
manly
fortitude
.
<EOS>
and
a
terrible
trial
<EOS>
it
be
to
one
like
him
,
in
the
very
prime
of
life
,
with
every
inducement
to
live
—
<EOS>
just
,
too
,
on
the
verge
of
happiness
—
to
be
thus
snatch
away
from
all
he
love
and
hold
dear
,
and
slowly
torture
out
of
existence
into
the
dread
,
unknown
Beyond
.
<EOS>
but
most
terrible
of
all
,
be
the
madden
thought
of
the
dear
one
he
love
,
who
would
be
leave
behind
in
the
power
of
the
most
inhuman
monster
on
earth
.
<EOS>
be
Kate
at
liberty
and
safe
,
he
feel
he
could
die
comparatively
happy
.
<EOS>
the
suffering
of
the
body
alone
,
he
fancy
,
could
be
bear
;
but
the
suffering
of
body
and
mind
together
,
be
a
something
to
sap
his
courage
,
and
make
the
man
a
child
.
<EOS>
nor
be
his
feeling
of
despair
lessen
,
as
he
turn
his
gaze
upward
toward
the
glorious
sun
,
(
that
now
ascend
the
heavens
,
pour
his
light
and
warmth
upon
the
great
earth
)
then
around
upon
the
beauty
of
nature
everywhere
display
before
him
—
feel
the
soft
,
balmy
breeze
upon
his
cheek
,
and
remember
that
he
be
about
to
bid
adieu
to
all
these
bright
thing
forever
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
decide
by
the
Indians
,
that
Clifton
should
suffer
first
,
and
therefore
only
one
place
of
torture
have
be
prepare
,
which
be
afterward
to
serve
for
the
gardener
,
who
,
in
consequence
,
still
remain
bind
to
his
tree
.
<EOS>
the
spot
choose
for
the
horrid
rite
,
be
a
little
open
patch
of
ground
,
near
which
grow
a
cluster
of
bush
,
form
part
of
a
thicket
that
stretch
away
to
the
Little
Miami
,
but
not
so
as
to
obstruct
the
view
of
the
other
prisoner
—
it
be
the
policy
of
the
Indians
to
have
them
spectator
of
the
awful
spectacle
.
<EOS>
the
appearance
of
Clifton
upon
the
ground
,
be
the
signal
for
the
savage
to
set
up
a
series
of
horrid
yell
,
to
dance
around
him
in
brutal
triumph
,
and
pinch
,
beat
and
otherwise
maltreat
him
with
their
hand
and
fist
.
<EOS>
this
last
some
ten
or
fifteen
minute
,
and
be
bear
by
the
prisoner
without
a
word
of
complaint
.
<EOS>
in
this
savage
custom
,
in
justice
be
it
say
,
Moody
do
not
join
;
but
fold
his
arm
upon
his
breast
,
he
stand
a
little
apart
,
regard
his
brother
in
stern
silence
.
<EOS>
when
they
have
amuse
themselves
sufficiently
in
this
way
,
the
Indians
begin
strip
their
victim
of
his
apparel
,
preparatory
to
bind
him
to
the
stake
.
<EOS>
first
his
coat
,
then
his
vest
,
and
then
piece
after
piece
of
his
other
garment
,
theytore
rudely
from
him
,
and
with
some
of
them
decorate
their
own
hideous
person
.
<EOS>
as
they
rent
the
bosom
of
his
shirt
,
the
silver
box
present
him
by
Luther
,
which
have
be
place
there
for
safe
keeping
,
roll
out
and
fall
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
in
an
instant
,
Moody
,
who
have
so
far
be
only
a
spectator
,
spring
forward
,
and
seize
it
with
avidity
.
<EOS>
"what
be
this
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
,
turn
it
over
and
over
,
and
note
with
wonder
the
strange
character
upon
it
.
<EOS>
"
speak
,
sirrah
!
<EOS>
what
be
this
?
"
<EOS>
he
pursue
,
address
himself
to
Clifton
.
<EOS>
but
the
lat
ter
deign
him
no
answer
;
and
muttering
,
"
take
that
for
your
silence
,
"
Moody
strike
him
with
his
fist
a
violent
blow
upon
the
side
of
his
head
,
and
coolly
hide
the
box
under
his
vestment
to
be
examine
at
some
future
time
.
<EOS>
have
at
length
strip
Clifton
entirely
,
the
Indians
proceed
to
attach
him
to
the
stake
,
by
mean
of
a
rope
make
of
deer
-
skin
,
and
in
such
a
manner
as
to
leave
him
a
little
play
round
the
circle
,
but
not
enough
to
reach
the
fire
.
<EOS>
They
then
have
another
dance
around
him
,
accompany
with
horrible
yell
,
when
a
warrior
suddenly
appear
with
a
burn
brand
,
and
apply
it
to
the
combustible
pile
.
<EOS>
the
stick
,
many
of
them
be
small
and
dry
,
be
very
ignitable
,
and
in
a
moment
the
red
flame
shoot
upward
,
and
flash
,
and
crackle
and
creep
around
the
circle
,
until
the
prisoner
,
to
those
at
a
little
distance
,
appear
envelop
in
fire
and
smoke
.
<EOS>
gradually
the
heat
become
more
and
more
intense
,
untill
the
position
of
Clifton
,
who
keep
himself
close
to
the
stake
,
be
render
not
a
little
painful
,
and
already
a
few
blister
begin
to
make
their
appearance
on
his
tender
skin
.
<EOS>
"Now
<EOS>
for
the
burn
powder
,
"
cry
Moody
,
with
a
horrid
laugh
;
and
point
his
rifle
toward
the
naked
body
of
Clifton
,
he
be
already
in
the
act
of
pullinh
the
trigger
,
when
suddenly
the
muzzle
drop
to
the
ground
,
and
its
owner
,
turn
ghastly
pale
,
stand
,
with
mouth
distend
,
and
<EOS>
eye
half
start
from
their
socket
,
gaze
in
the
direction
of
the
thicket
,
and
tremble
with
very
fear
.
<EOS>
the
Indians
,
too
,
suddenly
halt
in
their
savage
rite
,
and
utter
the
single
word
"
Kitcho
-
chobeka
,
"
shrink
cower
back
,
with
look
expressive
of
surprise
and
dismay
.
<EOS>
the
next
moment
a
powerful
figure
rush
through
the
flame
,
and
cut
the
bond
of
the
prisoner
,
raise
and
bear
him
to
a
safe
distance
beyond
the
fatal
circle
.
<EOS>
turn
with
a
look
of
unspeakable
grattitude
to
his
deliverer
,
Clifton
,
to
his
amazement
and
joy
,
beheld
in
him
the
tall
,
ungainly
,
but
command
form
of
Blind
Luther

the
Necromancer

see
their

to
its

he
wave
his

still
the

linger
;
and
fearful
they
may
,
in
spite

of
their
fear

a
rescue

Luther
suddenly
thrust
his
hand
into
his
bosom

and
draw
forth
a
ball
,
some
three
inch
in
diameter
,
which
he
have
previously
prepare
for
such
an
emergency

<EOS>
this
proceeding

by

over

<EOS>
this
be
exactly
what
he
desire
;
and
mutter
some
unintelligible
word
,
and
look
upward
,
as
if
appeal
to
Heaven
,
he
suddenly
,
and
by
a
dexterous
movement
,
cast
it
beyond

into
the
flame

at
the

time
shouting:"Behold

follow

,
as

beheld
first
a

shoot
upward

the

modestly

<EOS>
such
be
the
fact

and
an
unusual
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
Indians
,
have
aid
him
most
essentially
.
<EOS>
feel
perfectly
secure
,
and
not
wish
uselessly
to
encumber
themselves
,
they
have
place
most
of
the
weapon
take
from
the
white
in
a
pile
by
themselves
,
near
the
thicket
.
<EOS>
while
they
be
intently
occupy
in
council
,
Luther
have
manage
to
get
possession
of
these
,
and
afterward
distribute
them
among
their
owner
,
caution
them
,
ere
<EOS>
he
cut
their
cord
,
not
to
stir
,
unless
they
be
attack
,

hear
a
signal
from
him

then
approach
Kate

a
noiseless
manner

just
as
she

regain
consciousness
,
be
look
about
her
in
alarm
,
he
whisper
a
few
word
of
hope

consolation
in
her
ear
,

free
her
also
,
with
the
same
injunction
as
to
remain
stationary
.
<EOS>
this
done
,
he
have
regain
the
thicket
,
and
appear
before
the
savage
in
the
manner
already
show
.
<EOS>
terrify
at
the
feat
of
the
Necromancer
,
but
madden
at
the
release
of
their
prisoner
,
<EOS>
no
sooner
have
the
Indians
fairly
hide
themselves
in
the
thicket
,
than
thought
of
vengeance
take
possession
of
their
half
crazy
brain
,
and
they
pause
for
consultation
.
<EOS>
under
the
excitement
they
be
labor
,
this
be
very
short
,
and
result
in
their
decision
to
steal
upon
the
bind
prisoner
,
tomahawk
and
scalp
them
,
and
return
to
their
home
.
<EOS>
lead
by
the
now
infuriate
Mugwa

they
make
a
sally
for
the
purpose

be
bear
kown
upon
their
suppose
victim

when

to
their
unbounded
astonishment

dismay
,

terror

each
captive
spring
behind
his
tree
,

send
the
content
of
his
rifle
among

<EOS>
this
,
to
the
Indians
,
be
a
work
of
magic
indeed
;
and
overpower
by
amazement
and
terror
,
they
pause
for
a
moment
irresolute
.
<EOS>
the
next
they
turn
and
dart
away
,
utter
horrible
yell
,
follow
by
the
white
.
<EOS>
three
of
their
number
have
be
wound
,
but
not
so
as
to
prevent
their
flight
,
and
in
a
few
second
all
have
gain
the
cover
of
the
thicket

<EOS>
into
this
the
white
be
prudent
enough
not
to
venture
,
but
turn
back
,
congratulate
themselves
upon
their
fortunate
and
timely
escape
.
<EOS>
Their
first
move
be
to
reload
their
rifle
,
and
thus
be
prepare
for
a
second
attack
,
in
case
the
savage
should
desire
to
renew
the
contest
—
a
proceeding
,
however
,
which
be
look
upon
as
highly
improbable
.
<EOS>
They
then
repair
to
where
Kate
be
stand
,
and
all
in
a
body
proceed
toward
the
Necromancer

in
their
flight

throw
away
most
of
the
garment

he
make
one
bind
forward
,
catch
her
in
his
arm

her
to
his
heart
in
silence

<EOS>
the
emotion
of
both
be
too
deep
for
word
.
<EOS>
His
friend
now
crowd
around
him
,

seize
his
hand
,
one
after
another

they
allow
their
tearful
eye
to
say
what
their
tongue
have
not
power
to

It
be
a
solemn
,

joyful
meeting

"Now

pace
distant

from
a
cluster
of
bush
near

Ichabod

<EOS>
"You'll
find
him
there
all

David

coolly

as
some
two

three

off
to

the

turn
him
over
,
they
recognise
the
grim
feature
of
Unkee

<EOS>
More
blood

thirsty
and
daring
than
his
companion

he
have
stealthily
venture
hither
to
take
the

prisoner

the
quick
ear

the
manner
of
Luther

as
they
come
up
to
the
other

arrest
the
attention
of
all

<EOS>
He
have
turn
his
face
toward
the
west
,
place
his
hand
over
his
eye
,
and
now
stand
sway
to
and
fro
like
some
strong
oak
shake
by
the
blast
—

,
like
one
whose
mind
be

by
some
powerful
thought

<EOS>
no
one
venture
to
address
him

all
stand

him
with
awe

silence

at
length

remove
his

slowly

turn
his

they
see
that
countenance

over

short
a
time

have
come
a
fearful
change

<EOS>
His
dark
feature

pale

seem
bloodless

roll
more
rapidly
than
usual
in
its
socket
;
the
lid
quiver
more
nervously
,
and
the
whole
face
be
uncommonly
agitate

as
if
by
some
inward
struggle

"It

I

a

and
two
rough

<EOS>
from
what
little
could

it
