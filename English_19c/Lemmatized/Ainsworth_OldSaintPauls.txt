<EOS>
Old
Saint
Paul
's
       
A
Tale
of
the
Plague
and
the
Fire
author
:
<EOS>
William
Harrison
Ainsworth
    
<EOS>
the
portion
of
the
ensue
Tale
relate
to
the
Grocer
of
Wood
-
street
,
and
his
manner
of
victual
his
house
,
and
shut
up
himself
and
his
family
within
it
during
the
bad
part
of
the
Plague
of
1665
,
be
found
on
a
narrative
,
which
I
have
follow
pretty
closely
in
most
of
its
detail
,
contain
in
a
very
rare
little
volume
,
entitle
,
"
_
preparation
against
the
Plague
,
both
of
Soul
and
Body
_
,
"
the
authorship
of
which
I
have
no
hesitation
in
assigning
to
DEFOE
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
venture
to
pronounce
it
his
masterpiece
.
<EOS>
It
be
strange
that
this
matchless
performance
should
have
hitherto
escape
attention
,
and
that
it
should
not
have
be
reprint
with
some
one
of
the
countless
impression
of
the
"
_
history
of
the
Plague
of
London
_
,
"
to
which
it
form
an
almost
necessary
accompaniment
.
<EOS>
the
omission
,
I
trust
,
will
be
repair
by
Mr.
HAZLITT
the
young
,
DEFOE
's
last
and
good
editor
,
in
his
valuable
edition
of
the
work
of
that
great
novelist
and
political
writer
,
now
in
the
course
of
publication
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
add
,
that
a
case
precisely
similar
to
that
of
the
Grocer
,
and
attend
with
the
same
happy
result
,
occur
during
the
Plague
of
Marseilles
,
in
1720
.
 
<EOS>
for
my
acquaintance
with
this
narrative
,
as
well
as
for
the
suggestion
of
its
application
to
the
present
purpose
,
I
be
indebted
to
my
friend
,
Mr.
JAMES
CROSSLEY

of
Manchester

-
STREET
and
his
FAMILY
.
 
<EOS>
one
night
,
at
the
latter
end
of
April
,
1665
,
the
family
of
a
citizen
of
London
carry
on
an
extensive
business
as
a
grocer
in
wood
-
street
,
Cheapside
,
be
assemble
,
accord
to
custom
,
at
prayer
.
<EOS>
the
grocer
's
name
be
Stephen
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
His
family
consist
of
his
wife
,
three
son
,
and
two
daughter
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
moreover
,
an
apprentice
;
an
elderly
female
serving
as
cook
;
her
son
,
a
young
man
about
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
fill
the
place
of
porter
to
the
shop
and
general
assistant
;
and
a
kitchen
-
maid
.
<EOS>
the
whole
household
attend
;
for
the
worthy
grocer
,
be
a
strict
observer
of
his
religious
duty
,
as
well
as
a
rigid
disciplinarian
in
other
respect
,
suffer
no
one
to
be
absent
,
on
any
plea
<EOS>
whatever
,
except
indisposition
,
from
morning
and
evening
devotion
;
and
these
be
always
perform
at
stated
time
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
the
establishment
be
conduct
with
the
regularity
of
clockwork
,
it
be
the
aim
of
its
master
not
to
pass
a
single
hour
of
the
day
unprofitably
.
 
<EOS>
the
ordinary
prayer
go
through
,
Stephen
Bloundel
offer
up
along
and
fervent
supplication
to
the
most
high
for
protection
against
the
devour
pestilence
with
which
the
city
be
then
scourge
.
<EOS>
He
acknowledge
that
this
terrible
visitation
have
be
justly
bring
upon
it
by
the
wickedness
of
its
inhabitant
;
that
they
deserve
their
doom
,
dreadful
though
it
be
;
that
,
like
the
dweller
in
Jerusalem
before
it
be
give
up
to
ruin
and
desolation
,
they
"
have
mock
the
messenger
of
God
and
despise
His
word
;
"
that
in
the
language
of
the
prophet
,
"
they
have
refuse
to
hearken
,
and
pull
away
the
shoulder
,
and
stop
their
ear
that
they
should
not
hear
;
yea
,
have
make
their
heart
like
an
adamant
stone
,
lest
they
should
hear
the
law
and
the
word
which
the
Lord
of
Hosts
have
send
in
his
spirit
by
the
former
prophet
.
"
<EOS>
He
admit
that
great
sin
require
great
chastisement
,
and
that
the
sin
of
London
be
enormous
;
that
it
be
fill
with
strife
,
sedition
,
heresy
,
murder
,
drunkenness
,
revelling
,
and
every
kind
of
abomination
;
that
the
ordinance
of
God
be
neglect
,
and
all
manner
of
vice
openly
practise
;
that
,
despite
repeat
warning
and
affliction
less
grievous
than
the
present
,
these
vicious
practice
have
be
persist
in
.
<EOS>
all
this
he
humbly
acknowledge
.
<EOS>
but
he
implore
a
gracious
Providence
,
in
consideration
of
his
few
faithful
servant
,
to
spare
the
other
yet
a
little
longer
,
and
give
them
a
last
chance
of
repentance
and
amendment
;
or
,
if
this
could
not
be
,
and
their
utter
extirpation
be
inevitable
,
that
the
habitation
of
the
devout
may
be
exempt
from
the
general
destruction
--
may
be
place
of
refuge
,
as
Zoar
be
to
Lot
.
<EOS>
He
conclude
by
earnestly
exhort
those
around
him
to
keep
constant
watch
upon
themselves
;
not
to
murmur
at
God
's
dealing
and
dispensation
;
but
so
to
comport
themselves
,
that
"
they
may
be
able
to
stand
in
the
day
of
wrath
,
in
the
day
of
death
,
and
in
the
day
of
judgment
.
"
<EOS>
the
exhortation
produce
a
powerful
effect
upon
its
hearer
,
and
they
arise
,
some
with
serious
,
other
with
terrified
look
.
 
<EOS>
before
proceed
further
,
it
may
be
desirable
to
show
in
what
manner
the
dreadful
pestilence
refer
to
by
the
grocer
commence
,
and
how
far
its
ravage
have
already
extend
.
<EOS>
two
year
before
,
namely
,
in
1663
,
more
than
a
third
of
the
population
of
Amsterdam
be
carry
off
by
a
desolating
plague
.
<EOS>
Hamburgh
be
also
grievously
afflict
about
the
same
time
,
and
in
the
same
manner
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
every
effort
to
cut
off
communication
with
these
state
,
the
insidious
disease
find
its
way
into
England
by
mean
of
some
bale
of
merchandise
,
as
it
be
suspect
,
at
the
latter
end
of
the
year
1664
,
when
two
person
die
suddenly
,
with
undoubted
symptom
of
the
distemper
,
in
Westminster
.
<EOS>
Its
next
appearance
be
at
a
house
in
Long
Acre
,
and
its
victim
two
frenchman
,
who
have
bring
good
from
the
levant
.
<EOS>
smother
for
a
short
time
,
like
a
fire
upon
which
coal
have
be
heap
,
it
break
out
with
fresh
fury
in
several
place
.
 
<EOS>
the
consternation
now
begin
.
<EOS>
the
whole
city
be
panic
-
stricken
:
nothing
be
talk
of
but
the
plague
--
nothing
plan
but
mean
of
arrest
its
progress
--
<EOS>
one
grim
and
ghastly
idea
possess
the
mind
of
all
.
<EOS>
like
a
hideous
phantom
stalk
the
street
at
noon
-
day
,
and
scare
all
in
its
path
,
Death
take
his
course
through
London
,
and
select
his
prey
at
pleasure
.
<EOS>
the
alarm
be
further
increase
by
the
prediction
confidently
make
as
to
the
vast
number
who
would
be
sweep
away
by
the
visitation
;
by
the
prognostication
of
astrologer
;
by
the
prophesying
of
enthusiast
;
by
the
denunciation
of
preacher
,
and
by
the
portent
and
prodigy
report
to
have
occur
.
<EOS>
during
the
long
and
frosty
winter
precede
this
fatal
year
,
a
comet
appear
in
the
heavens
,
the
sickly
colour
of
which
be
suppose
to
forebode
the
judgment
about
to
follow
.
<EOS>
blaze
star
and
other
meteor
,
of
a
lurid
hue
and
strange
and
preternatural
shape
,
be
likewise
see
.
<EOS>
the
sun
be
say
to
have
set
in
stream
of
blood
,
and
the
moon
to
have
show
without
reflect
a
shadow
;
grisly
shape
appear
at
night
--
<EOS>
strange
clamour
and
groan
be
hear
in
the
air
--
<EOS>
hearse
,
coffin
,
and
heap
of
unburied
dead
be
discover
in
the
sky
,
and
great
cake
and
clot
of
blood
be
find
in
the
Tower
moat
;
while
a
marvellous
double
tide
occur
at
London
Bridge
.
<EOS>
all
these
prodigy
be
currently
report
,
and
in
most
case
believe
.
 
<EOS>
the
severe
frost
,
before
notice
,
do
not
break
up
till
the
end
of
February
,
and
with
the
thaw
the
plague
frightfully
increase
in
violence
.
<EOS>
from
Drury
-
lane
it
spread
along
Holborn
,
eastward
as
far
as
Great
Turnstile
,
and
westward
to
Saint
Giles
's
Pound
,
and
so
along
the
Tyburn
-
road
.
<EOS>
Saint
Andrew
's
,
Holborn
,
be
next
infect
;
and
as
this
be
a
much
more
populous
parish
than
the
former
,
the
death
be
more
numerous
within
it
.
<EOS>
for
a
while
,
the
disease
be
check
by
Fleet
Ditch
;
it
then
leap
this
narrow
boundary
,
and
ascend
the
opposite
hill
,
carry
fearful
devastation
into
Saint
James
's
,
Clerkenwell
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
it
attack
Saint
Bride
's
;
thin
the
rank
of
the
thievish
horde
haunt
Whitefriars
,
and
proceed
in
a
westerly
course
,
decimate
Saint
Clement
Danes
.
 
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
the
city
have
escape
.
<EOS>
the
destroyer
have
not
pass
Ludgate
or
Newgate
,
but
environ
the
wall
like
a
besiege
enemy
.
<EOS>
a
few
day
,
however
,
before
the
opening
of
this
history
,
fine
weather
have
commence
,
the
horrible
disease
begin
to
grow
more
rife
,
and
laugh
all
precaution
and
impediment
to
scorn
,
break
out
in
the
very
heart
of
the
stronghold
--
namely
,
in
Bearbinder
-
lane
,
near
Stock
's
Market
,
where
nine
person
die
.
 
<EOS>
at
a
season
so
awful
,
it
may
be
imagine
how
an
impressive
address
,
like
that
deliver
by
the
grocer
,
would
be
receive
by
those
who
see
in
the
pestilence
,
not
merely
an
overwhelming
scourge
from
which
few
could
escape
,
but
a
direct
manifestation
of
the
Divine
displeasure
.
<EOS>
not
a
word
be
say
.
<EOS>
Blaize
Shotterel
,
the
porter
,
and
old
Josyna
,
his
mother
,
together
with
Patience
,
the
other
woman
-
servant
,
betook
themselves
silently
,
and
with
troubled
countenance
,
to
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
Leonard
Holt
,
the
apprentice
,
linger
for
a
moment
to
catch
a
glance
from
the
soft
blue
eye
of
Amabel
,
the
grocer
's
eld
daughter
(
for
even
the
plague
be
a
secondary
consideration
with
him
when
she
be
present
)
,
and
fail
in
the
attempt
,
he
heave
a
deep
sigh
,
which
be
luckily
lay
to
the
account
of
the
discourse
he
have
just
listen
to
by
his
sharp
-
sighted
master
,
and
proceed
to
the
shop
,
where
he
busy
himself
in
arrange
matter
for
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
have
just
complete
his
twenty
-
first
year
,
and
his
apprenticeship
be
within
a
few
month
of
its
expiration
,
Leonard
Holt
begin
to
think
of
return
to
his
native
town
of
Manchester
,
where
he
intend
to
settle
,
and
where
he
have
once
fondly
hope
the
fair
Amabel
would
accompany
him
,
in
the
character
of
his
bride
.
<EOS>
not
that
he
have
ever
venture
to
declare
his
passion
,
nor
that
he
have
receive
sufficient
encouragement
to
make
it
matter
of
certainty
that
if
he
do
so
declare
himself
,
he
should
be
accept
;
but
be
both
"
proper
and
tall
,
"
and
have
tolerable
confidence
in
his
good
look
,
he
have
make
himself
,
up
to
a
short
time
prior
to
his
introduction
to
the
reader
,
quite
easy
on
the
point
.
 
<EOS>
His
present
misgiving
be
occasion
by
Amabel
's
altered
manner
towards
him
,
and
by
a
rival
who
,
he
have
reason
to
fear
,
have
completely
supersede
him
in
her
good
grace
.
<EOS>
bring
up
together
from
an
early
age
,
the
grocer
's
daughter
and
the
young
apprentice
have
at
first
regard
each
other
as
brother
and
sister
.
<EOS>
by
degree
,
the
feeling
change
;
Amabel
become
more
reserved
,
and
hold
little
intercourse
with
Leonard
,
who
,
busied
with
his
own
concern
,
think
little
about
her
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
he
grow
towards
manhood
,
he
could
not
remain
insensible
to
her
extraordinary
beauty
--
for
extraordinary
it
be
,
and
such
as
to
attract
admiration
wherever
she
go
,
so
that
the
"
Grocer
's
Daughter
"
become
the
toast
among
the
ruffle
gallant
of
the
town
,
many
of
whom
seek
to
obtain
speech
with
her
.
<EOS>
Her
parent
,
however
,
be
far
too
careful
to
permit
any
such
approach
.
<EOS>
Amabel
's
stature
be
lofty
;
her
limb
slight
,
but
exquisitely
symmetrical
;
her
feature
small
,
and
cast
in
the
most
delicate
mould
;
her
eye
of
the
soft
blue
;
and
her
hair
luxuriant
,
and
of
the
fine
texture
and
rich
brown
.
<EOS>
Her
other
beauty
must
be
leave
to
the
imagination
;
but
it
ought
not
to
be
omit
that
she
be
barely
eighteen
,
and
have
all
the
freshness
,
the
innocence
,
and
vivacity
of
that
most
charming
period
of
woman
's
existence
.
<EOS>
no
wonder
she
ravish
every
heart
.
<EOS>
no
wonder
,
in
an
age
when
love
-
make
be
more
general
even
than
now
,
that
she
be
beset
by
admirer
.
<EOS>
no
wonder
her
father
's
apprentice
become
desperately
enamour
of
her
,
and
proportionately
jealous
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
bring
us
to
his
rival
.
<EOS>
on
the
10th
of
April
,
two
gallant
,
both
richly
attire
,
and
both
young
and
handsome
,
dismount
before
the
grocer
's
door
,
and
,
leave
their
steed
to
the
care
of
their
attendant
,
enter
the
shop
.
<EOS>
They
make
sundry
purchase
of
conserve
,
fig
,
and
other
dry
fruit
,
chat
familiarly
with
the
grocer
,
and
tarry
so
long
,
that
at
last
he
begin
to
suspect
they
must
have
some
motive
.
<EOS>
all
at
once
,
however
,
they
disagree
on
some
slight
matter
--
Bloundel
could
not
tell
what
,
nor
,
perhaps
,
could
the
disputant
,
even
if
their
quarrel
be
not
preconcerte
--
high
word
arise
,
and
in
another
moment
,
sword
be
draw
,
and
furious
pass
exchange
.
<EOS>
the
grocer
call
to
his
eld
son
,
a
stout
youth
of
nineteen
,
and
to
Leonard
Holt
,
to
separate
them
.
<EOS>
the
apprentice
seize
his
cudgel
--
<EOS>
no
apprentice
in
those
day
be
without
one
--
and
rush
towards
the
combatant
,
but
before
he
could
interfere
,
the
fray
be
end
.
<EOS>
one
of
them
have
receive
a
thrust
through
the
sword
arm
,
and
his
blade
dropping
,
his
antagonist
declare
himself
satisfied
,
and
with
a
grave
salute
walk
off
.
<EOS>
the
wounded
man
wrap
a
lace
handkerchief
round
his
arm
,
but
immediately
afterwards
complain
of
great
faintness
.
<EOS>
pity
his
condition
,
and
suspect
no
harm
,
the
grocer
lead
him
into
an
inner
room
,
where
restorative
be
offer
by
Mrs.
Bloundel
and
her
daughter
Amabel
,
both
of
whom
have
be
alarm
by
the
noise
of
the
conflict
.
<EOS>
in
a
short
time
,
the
wounded
man
be
so
far
recover
as
to
be
able
to
converse
with
his
assistant
,
especially
the
young
one
;
and
the
grocer
have
return
to
the
shop
,
his
discourse
become
so
very
animated
and
tender
,
that
Mrs.
Bloundel
deem
it
prudent
to
give
her
daughter
a
hint
to
retire
.
<EOS>
Amabel
reluctantly
obey
,
for
the
young
stranger
be
so
handsome
,
so
richly
dressed
,
have
such
a
captivating
manner
,
and
so
distinguish
an
air
,
that
she
be
strongly
prepossess
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
a
second
look
from
her
mother
,
however
,
cause
her
to
disappear
,
nor
do
she
return
.
<EOS>
after
wait
with
suppress
anxiety
for
some
time
,
the
young
gallant
depart
,
overwhelm
the
good
dame
with
his
thank
,
and
entreat
permission
to
call
again
.
<EOS>
this
be
peremptorily
refuse
,
but
,
notwithstanding
the
interdiction
,
he
come
on
the
follow
day
.
<EOS>
the
grocer
chance
to
be
out
at
the
time
,
and
the
gallant
,
who
have
probably
watch
him
go
forth
,
deride
the
remonstrance
of
the
young
Bloundel
and
Leonard
,
march
straight
to
the
inner
room
,
where
he
find
the
dame
and
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
They
be
much
disconcert
at
his
appearance
,
and
the
latter
instantly
rise
with
the
intention
of
retire
,
but
the
gallant
catch
her
arm
and
detain
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
fly
me
,
Amabel
,
"
he
cry
,
in
an
impassioned
tone
,
"
but
suffer
me
to
declare
the
love
I
have
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
live
without
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Amabel
,
whose
neck
and
cheek
be
crimson
with
blush
,
cast
down
her
eye
before
the
ardent
regard
of
the
gallant
,
and
endeavour
to
withdraw
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
one
word
only
,
"
he
continue
,
"
and
I
release
you
.
<EOS>
be
I
wholly
indifferent

<EOS>
answer
me
--

"
 
<EOS>
"
do
_

<EOS>
"
He

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
this
be
the
way
with
all
these
court
butterfly
.
<EOS>
tell
him
you
hate
him
,
child
,
and
bid
him
begone

"
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
can
not
tell
him
an
untruth

"
return
Amabel
,
artlessly
,
"
for
I
do

"
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
love
me
,
"
cry
the
young
man
,
fall
on
his
knee
,
and
press
her
hand
to
his
lip
.
<EOS>
"
tell
me
so
,
and
make
me
the
happy
of
man
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
Amabel
have
now
recover
from
the
confusion
into
which
she
have
be
throw
,
and
,
alarm
at
her
own
indiscretion
,
forcibly
withdraw
her
hand
,
exclaim
in
a
cold
tone
,
and
with
much
natural
dignity
,
"
Arise
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
tolerate
these
freedom

<EOS>
My
mother
be
right

you

some
ill
design

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
by
my
soul

no

cry
the
gallant
,
passionately
.
<EOS>
"
I
love
you

and
would
make
you
mine

"
 
<EOS>
"
no

remark
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
contemptuously
,
"
but
not
by
marriage

"
 
<EOS>
"
yes

by

rejoin
the
gallant
,
rise
.
<EOS>
"
if
she
will
consent
,
I
will
we
would
her
forthwith
.
"
 
<EOS>
both
Amabel
and
her
mother
look
surprised
at
the
young
man
's
declaration
,
which
be
utter
with
a
fervour
that
seem
to
leave
no
doubt
of
its
sincerity
;
but
the
latter
,
fear
some
artifice
,
reply
,
"
if
what
you
say
be
true
,
and
you
really
love
my
daughter
as
much
as
you
pretend
,
this
be
not
the
way
to
win
her
;
for
though
she
can
have
no
pretension
to
we
would
with
one
of
your
seeming
degree
,
nor
be
it
for
her
happiness
that
she
should
,
yet
,
be
she
seek
by
the
proud
noble
in
the
land
,
she
shall
never
,
if
I
can
help
it
,
be
lightly

<EOS>
if
your
intention
be
honourable
,
you
must
address
yourself
,
in
the
first
place
,
to
her
father
,
and
if
he
agree
(
which
I
much
doubt
)
that
you
shall
become
her
suitor

I
can
make
no
objection

<EOS>
till
this
be
settle

I
must
pray
you
to
desist
from
further
importunity

<EOS>

so
must
I

add
Amabel

<EOS>
"
I
can
not

you
a
hope

you
have
speak
to
my

<EOS>

be
it
so

the
gallant
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
tarry
here
till
his
return

<EOS>
so
say
,
he
be
about
to
seat
himself

Mrs.
Bloundel
prevent
him

<EOS>
"
I
can
not

she
cry

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
tarrying
here
may
,
for
aught
I
know
,
bring
scandal
upon
my
house;--i
be
sure
it
will
be
disagreeable
to
my
husband
.
<EOS>
I
be
unacquainted
with
your
name
and
condition
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
a
man
of
rank
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
one
of
the
profligate
and
profane
crew
who
haunt
the
court
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
the
bad
of
them
all
,
my
Lord
Rochester
himself
.
<EOS>
He
be
about
your
age
,
I
have
hear
,
and
though
a
mere
boy
in
year
,
be
a
veteran
in
libertinism
.
<EOS>
but
,
whoever
you
be
,
and
whatever
your
rank
and
station
may
be
,
unless
your
character
will
bear
the
strict
scrutiny
,
I
be
certain
Stephen
Bloundel
will
never
consent
to
your
union
with
his
daughter

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
mother
,
"
observe
Amabel
,
"
<EOS>
you
judge
the
gentleman
unjustly

<EOS>
I
be
sure
he
be
neither
a
profligate
gallant
himself
,
nor
a
companion
of
such
--
especially
of
the
wicked
Earl
of
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
pretend
to
be
no
well

I

"
reply
the
young
man
,
repress
a
smile
that
rise
to
his
lip
at
Mrs.
Bloundel
's
address
;
"
but
I
shall
reform
when
I

<EOS>
It

be
impossible

Amabel

It

deeply

now

You

avert

<EOS>
"
Nay

I

I

return
shortly

trust
to
find
your

less
flinty

<EOS>
He
would
have
clasp
Amabel
in
his
arm

and
perhaps
snatch
a
kiss
,
if
her
mother
have
not
rush
between
them

<EOS>
"
no

familiarity

angrily

if

Wyvil

audaciously

"
You

better

Amabel

coldly

<EOS>
He
will
scarcely
carry
me
off

my

I
be
not

sacrifice
myself

light
esteem

<EOS>
"
forgive
me

Amabel

rejoin
Wyvil
,
in
a
voice
so
penitent

it
instantly
efface
her
displeasure

I

a
dark
shade
pass
over
Wyvil
's
handsome
feature

the
almost
feminine
beauty
by
which
they
be

place

I

Their

reply
the
apprentice

sturdily
.
 
<EOS>
enrage
by
the
retort
,
Wyvil
would
have
draw
his
sword
,
but
a
blow
on
the
arm
disable
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Plague

cry
Amabel

,
and
look
with
the
great
commiseration
at
Wyvil
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
deal
with
him
far
too
rudely
already

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
since
I

"
rejoin
Wyvil
,
"
I
care
not
<EOS>
what
rude
treatment
I

from
this
churl

<EOS>
We
shall
soon

"
<EOS>
and
bow
to
her
,
he
stride
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Leonard
follow
him
to
the
shop
-
door
,
hope
some
further
pretext
for
quarrel
would
arise
,
but
he
be
disappointed
.
<EOS>
Wyvil
take
no
notice
of
him
,
and
proceed
at
a
slow
pace
towards
Cheapside
.
 
<EOS>
half
an
hour
afterwards
,
Stephen
Bloundel
come
home
.
<EOS>
on
be
inform
of
what
have
occur
,
he
be
greatly
annoy
,
though
he
conceal
his
vexation
,
and
highly
applaud
his
daughter
's
conduct
.
<EOS>
without
further
comment
,
he
proceed
about
his
business
,
and
remain
in
the
shop
till
it
be
close
.
<EOS>
Wyvil
do
not
return
,
and
the
grocer
try
to
persuade
himself
they
should
see
nothing
more
of
him
.
<EOS>
before
Amabel
retire
to
rest
,
he
imprint
a
kiss
on
her
snowy
brow
,
and
say
,
in
a
tone
of
the
utmost
kindness
,
"
You
have
never
yet
deceive
me
,
child
,
and
I
hope
never
will
.
<EOS>
tell
me
truly
,
do
you
take
any
interest
in
this
young
gallant
?
"
 
<EOS>
Amabel
blush
deeply
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
speak
the
truth
,
father
,
"
she
rejoin
,
after
a
pause
,
"
if
I
be
to
say
I
do
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
for
it
,
"
reply
Bloundel
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
but
you
would
not
be
happy
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
he
be
unprincipled
and
profligate:--you
must
forget
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
to
do
so
,
"
sigh
Amabel
.
<EOS>
and
the
conversation
drop
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
follow
day
,
Maurice
Wyvil
enter
the
grocer
's
shop
.
<EOS>
He
be
more
richly
attire
than
before
,
and
there
be
a
haughtiness
in
his
manner
which
he
have
not
hitherto
assume
.
<EOS>
what
pass
between
him
and
Bloundel
be
not
know
,
for
the
latter
never
speak
of
it
;
but
the
result
may
be
gather
from
the
fact
that
the
young
gallant
be
not
allow
an
interview
with
the
grocer
's
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
from
this
moment
the
change
previously
notice
take
place
in
Amabel
's
demeanour
towards
Leonard
.
<EOS>
She
seem
scarcely
able
to
endure
his
presence
,
and
sedulously
avoid
his
regard
.
<EOS>
from
be
habitually
gay
and
cheerful
,
she
become
pensive
and
reserved
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
more
than
once
catch
her
in
tear
;
and
it
be
evident
,
from
many
other
sign
,
that
Wyvil
completely
engross
her
thought
.
<EOS>
fully
aware
of
this
,
Mrs.
Bloundel
say
nothing
of
it
to
her
husband
,
because
the
subject
be
painful
to
him
;
and
not
suppose
the
passion
deeply
rooted
,
she
hope
it
would
speedily
wear
away
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
mistake
--
the
flame
be
keep
alive
in
Amabel
's
breast
in
a
manner
of
which
she
be
totally
ignorant
.
<EOS>
Wyvil
find
mean
to
deceive
the
vigilance
of
the
grocer
and
his
wife
,
but
he
could
not
deceive
the
vigilance
of
a
jealous
lover
.
<EOS>
Leonard
discover
that
his
mistress
have
receive
a
letter
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
betray
her
,
but
he
determine
to
watch
her
narrowly
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
when
she
go
forth
one
morning
in
company
with
her
young
sister
(
a
little
girl
of
some
five
year
old
)
,
he
make
an
excuse
to
follow
them
,
and
,
keep
within
sight
,
perceive
them
enter
Saint
Paul
's
Cathedral
,
the
mid
aisle
of
which
be
then
convert
into
a
public
walk
,
and
generally
throng
with
town
gallant
,
bully
,
bona
-
robas
,
cut
-
purse
,
and
rogue
of
every
description
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
it
be
the
haunt
of
the
bad
of
character
of
the
metropolis
.
<EOS>
when
,
therefore
,
Amabel
enter
this
structure
,
Leonard
feel
certain
it
be
to
meet
her
lover
.
<EOS>
rush
forward
,
he
see
her
take
her
course
through
the
crowd
,
and
attract
general
attention
from
her
loveliness
--
but
he
nowhere
discern
Maurice
Wyvil
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
,
however
,
she
strike
off
to
the
right
,
and
halt
near
one
of
the
pillar
,
and
the
apprentice
,
advance
,
detect
his
rival
behind
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
whisper
a
few
word
in
her
ear
,
unperceived
by
her
sister
.
<EOS>
madden
by
the
sight
,
Leonard
hurry
towards
them
,
but
before
he
could
reach
the
spot
Wyvil
be
go
,
and
Amabel
,
though
greatly
confused
,
look
at
the
same
time
so
indignant
,
that
he
almost
regret
his
precipitation
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
,
of
course
,
make
known
to
my
father
what
you
have
just
see
?
<EOS>
"
she
say
in
a
low
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
promise
not
to
meet
that
gallant
again
without
my
knowledge
,
I
will
not
,
"
reply
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
moment
's
reflection
,
Amabel
give
the
required
promise
,
and
they
return
to
wood
-
street
together
.
<EOS>
satisfied
she
would
not
break
her
word
,
the
apprentice
become
more
easy
,
and
as
a
week
elapse
,
and
nothing
be
say
to
him
on
the
subject
,
he
persuade
himself
she
would
not
attempt
to
meet
her
lover
again
.
 
<EOS>
thing
be
in
this
state
at
the
opening
of
our
tale
,
but
upon
the
night
in
question
,
Leonard
fancy
he
discern
some
agitation
in
Amabel
's
manner
towards
him
,
and
in
consequence
of
this
notion
,
he
seek
to
meet
her
gaze
,
as
before
relate
,
after
prayer
.
<EOS>
while
try
to
distract
his
thought
by
arrange
sundry
firkin
of
butter
,
and
put
other
thing
in
order
,
he
hear
a
light
footstep
behind
him
,
and
turn
at
the
sound
,
beheld
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leonard
,
"
she
whisper
,
"
I
promise
to
tell
you
when
I
should
next
meet
Maurice
Wyvil
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
here
to
-
night
.
"
<EOS>
and
without
give
him
time
to
answer
,
she
retire
.
 
<EOS>
for
awhile
,
Leonard
remain
in
a
state
almost
of
stupefaction
,
repeat
to
himself
,
as
if
unwilling
to
believe
them
,
the
word
he
have
just
hear
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
recover
when
the
grocer
enter
the
shop
,
and
notice
his
haggard
look
,
kindly
inquire
if
he
feel
unwell
.
<EOS>
the
apprentice
return
an
evasive
answer
,
and
half
determined
to
relate
all
he
know
to
his
master
,
but
the
next
moment
he
change
his
intention
,
and
,
influence
by
that
chivalric
feeling
which
always
govern
those
,
of
whatever
condition
,
who
love
profoundly
,
resolve
not
to
betray
the
thoughtless
girl
,
but
to
trust
to
his
own
ingenuity
to
thwart
the
design
of
his
rival
,
and
preserve
her
acting
upon
this
resolution
,
he
say
he
have
a
slight
headache
,
and
instantly
resume
his
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
at
nine
o'clock
,
the
whole
family
assemble
at
supper
.
<EOS>
the
board
be
plentifully
though
plainly
spread
,
but
the
grocer
observe
,
with
some
uneasiness
,
that
his
apprentice
,
who
have
a
good
appetite
in
ordinary
,
eat
little
or
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
keep
his
eye
constantly
upon
him
,
and
become
convinced
from
his
manner
that
something
ail
him
.
<EOS>
not
have
any
notion
of
the
truth
,
and
be
fill
with
apprehension
of
the
plague
,
his
dread
be
that
Leonard
be
infect
by
the
disease
.
<EOS>
supper
be
generally
the
pleasantest
meal
of
the
day
at
the
grocer
's
house
,
but
on
this
occasion
it
pass
off
cheerlessly
enough
,
and
a
circumstance
occur
at
its
close
which
throw
all
into
confusion
and
distress
.
<EOS>
before
relate
this
,
however
,
we

of
the

under
their

<EOS>
Tall

and
of
a

somewhat
austere

.
<EOS>
His

high
and

and
well
define
,
and
his
general
appearance
exceedingly
strike
.
<EOS>
in
age
he
be
about
fifty
.
<EOS>
His
integrity
and
fairness

call
in
question
for
a
period
of
thirty
year
,
have
win
him
the
esteem
of
all
who
know
him
;
while
his
prudence
and
economy
have
enable
him
,
during
that
time
,
to
amass
a
tolerable
fortune
.
<EOS>
His

<EOS>
Mrs.
Bloundel

a
speciman
of
a
city
dame
of
the
good
kind

<EOS>
She
have
a
few
pardonable
vanity
,
which
no
argument
could
overcome
--
such
as
a
little
ostentation
in
dress
--
a
little
pride
in
the
neatness
of
her
house
--
and
a
good
deal
in
the
beauty
of
her
child
,
especially
in
that
of
Amabel
--
as
well
as
in
the
wealth
and
high
character
of
her
husband
,
whom
she
regard
as
the
most
perfect
of
human
being
.
<EOS>
these
slight
failing

,

with

nature
,
and
an

<EOS>
to

up
all

<EOS>
the
foregoing
description
of
the
grocer
's
family
would
be
incomplete
without
some
mention
of
his
household
.
<EOS>
Old

strong
attachment
for
him
,
be
a
hale
,
stout
dame
,
of
about
sixty
,
with
few
infirmity
for
her
year
,
and
with
less
asperity
of
temper
than

<EOS>
She

a
native
of
Holland
,
and
come
to
England
early
in

who

soon
after

<EOS>
an
excellent
cook
in
a
plain
way
--
indeed
,
she
have
no
practice
in
any

she
would
brew

ale
and
mead
,
or
mix
a
sack

posset
with
,
any
innkeeper
in
the
city

<EOS>
moreover

<EOS>
the

upon
her
as
a
second
mother
;
and
her
affection
for
them
,
which
be
unbounded
,
deserve
their
regard
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
perfect
storehouse
of
what

and
there

few
complaint
(
except
the
plague
)
for
which
she
do
not
think
herself
qualified
to
prescribe
and
able
to
cure
.
<EOS>
Her
skill
in
the
healing
art
be
often
test
by
her
charitable
mistress
,
who
require
her
to
prepare
remedy
,
as

as

for
such

at

Her

stout
,
stumpy
fellow
,
about
four
foot

with
a
head
somewhat
too
large
for
his

,
and
extremely
long
arm
.
<EOS>
ever
since
the
plague

break
out
in
Drury

it
haunt
him
like
a
spectre

and
scatter
the
few
faculty
he
possess

<EOS>
in
vain

try
to
combat
his
alarm
--
in
vain
his
mother

to
laugh
him
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
nothing
would
do
.
<EOS>
He
read
the
bill
of
mortality
daily
;
ascertain
the
particular
of
every
case
;
dilate
upon
the
agony
of
the
sufferer
;
watch
the
progress
of
the
infection
,
and
calculate
the
time
it
would
take
to
reach
wood

<EOS>

His

a
tall

with

disorder
masse
over
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
His
eye
be
large
and
black
,
and
blaze
with
insane
lustre
,
and
his
look
be
so
wild
and
terrific
,
that
it
require
no
great
stretch
of
imagination
to
convert
him
into
the
genius
of
the
pestilence

that
his

girt
with
a

him
an
unearthly
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
impel
by
curiosity
,
Leonard
pause
for
a
moment
to
listen
,
and
hear
him
thunder
forth
the
follow
denunciation:--"And
<EOS>
now
,
therefore
,
as
the
prophet
Jeremiah
saith
,
'
I
have
this
day
declare
it
to
you

but
ye
have
not
obey
the
voice
of
the
Lord
your
God
,
nor
anything
for
the
which
<EOS>
he
hath
send
me
unto
you

<EOS>
now
,
therefore
,
know
certainly
that
ye
shall
die
by
the
sword
,
by
the
famine
,
and
by
the
pestilence
.
'
<EOS>
again
,
in
the
word
of
the
prophet
Amos
,
the
Lord
saith
unto
you
by
my
mouth
,
'
I
have
send
among
you
the
pestilence
after
the
manner
of
Egypt
,
yet
have
you
not
return
unto
me

<EOS>
therefore
,
will
I
do
this
unto
thee
,
o
Israel
;
and
because
I
will
do
this
unto
thee
,
prepare
to
meet
thy
God
?
'
<EOS>
do
you
hear
this
,
o
sinner
?
<EOS>
God
will
proceed
against
you
in
the
day
of
His
wrath
,
though
He
hath
borne
with
you
in
the
day
of
His
patience
?
<EOS>
o
how
many
hundred
year
hath
<EOS>
He
spare
this
city
,
notwithstanding
its
great
provocation
and
wickedness
!
<EOS>
but
now
He
will
no
longer
show
it
pity
,
but
will
pour
out
His
wrath
upon
it
<EOS>
I
Plagues
shall
come
upon
it
,
and
desolation
;
and
it
shall
be
utterly
burn
with
fire,--for
strong
<EOS>
be
the
Lord
who
judgeth
it

"
 
<EOS>
His
address
conclude
,
the
enthusiast
start
off
at
a
swift
pace
,
shriek
,
in
a
voice
that
cause
many
person
to
throw
open
their
window
to
listen
to
him
,
"
awake
!
<EOS>
sinner
,
awake'--the
plague
be
at
your
doors!--the
grave
yawn
for
you!--awake
,
and
repent
!
"
<EOS>
and
follow
by
the
crowd
,
many
of
whom
keep
up
with
him
,
he
run
on
vociferate
in
this
manner
till
he
be
out
of
hearing
.
 
<EOS>
Hurrying
forward
in
the
opposite
direction
,
Leonard
glance
at
the
ancient
and
picturesque
house
on
either
side
of
the
way,--now
<EOS>
bathe
in
the
moonlight
,
and
apparently
hush
in
repose
<EOS>
and
security,--and
he
could
not
repress
a
shudder
as
he
reflect
that
an
evil
angel
be
,
indeed
,
abroad
,
who
may
suddenly
arouse
their
slumbering
inmate
to
despair
and
death
.
<EOS>
His
thought
take
another
turn
as
he
enter
the
precinct
of
Saint
Paul
's
,
and
survey
the
venerable
and
majestic
fabric
before
him
.
<EOS>
His
eye
rest
upon
its
innumerable
crocketed
pinnacle
,
its
buttress
,
its
battlement
,
and
upon
the
magnificent
rise
-
window
terminate
the
choir
.
<EOS>
the
apprentice
have
no
especial
love
for
antiquity
,
but
be
of
an
imaginative
turn
,
the
sight
of
this
reverend
structure
conjure
up
old
recollection
,
and
bring
to
mind
the
noble
Collegiate
Church
of
his
native
town
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
ever
see
Manchester
again
?
"
<EOS>
he
sigh
:
"
shall
I
take
Amabel
with
me
there
?
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
I
doubt
it
.
<EOS>
if
I
survive
the
plague
,
she
,
I
fear
,
will
never
be
mine

"
 
<EOS>
Musing
<EOS>
thus
,
he
scan
the
roof
of
the
cathedral
,
and
notice
its
stunted
central
tower
,
could
not
help
think
how
much
more
strike
its
effect
must
have
be
,
when
the
lofty
spire
it
once
support
be
stand
.
<EOS>
the
spire

it
may
be
remark
,
be
twice
destroy
by
lightning

in

1444

<EOS>
Most
of
the

have
the
fatal
sign
upon

--
a
red

of
a
foot
long

with
the
piteous
word
above
it

"

in
character
so
legible
that
they
could
be
easily

<EOS>
but
he

with
an
unexpected
and
fearful
interruption

<EOS>
just
as

while
thread

perceive
the
dead

before
a
house

from

two
small

<EOS>
hurry
past

he
remark
that
its
load

fearfully
increase

but
that
the
coffin

maker
and
his
companion
have
leave
it

<EOS>
another
minute
have
not
elapse
before
he
reach
Aldersgate
,
and
pass
through
the

,
he
behold
a

the
terrible
voice
of
Solomon
Eagle

<EOS>
shut

Leonard
do
not

His
first

remain
unanswere

he
repeat
it
,
and
a
wicket
be
then
open
by
a
grey

head
verger
,
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
,
who
at
first
be
very
angry
at

but
on
learn
whom
the
applicant
be
in

that

he
admit

<EOS>
the
path
be
uneven

many
of

and
the
verger
often
pause
to
throw
a
light
upon
the
ground

warn
his
companion

a
hole

<EOS>
on
arrive
at
the
head
of

nave

Leonard
cast
his
eye
down
it

and
be
surprised
at

magical
effect
of
the
moonlight
upon

magnificent
avenue

pillar

the
massive
shaft
on

<EOS>
It

see
sad
change

it
when
good
Queen

<EOS>
but
come
along
,
young
man,--you
have
something
else
to
think
of
now
.
"
 
<EOS>
bestow
a
momentary
glance
upon
the
matchless
choir
,
with
its
groin
roof
,
its
clerestory
window
,
its
arched
opening
,
its
carved
stall
,
and
its
gorgeous
rose
-
window
,
Leonard
follow
his
conductor
through
a
small
doorway
on
the
left
of
the
southern
transept
,
and
descend
a
flight
of
stone
step
,
enter
a
dark
and
extensive
vault
,
for
such
it
seem
.
<EOS>
the
feeble
light
of
the
lantern
fall
upon
rank
of
short
heavy
pillar
,
support
a
ponderous
arched
roof

<EOS>
"
You

"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
take
no
notice
of
the
remark
,
but
silently
cross
the
nave
of
this
beautiful
subterranean
church
(
part
of
which
still
exist

,
traverse
its
northern
aisle

<EOS>
at
length
the
verger

before
the
entrance
of
a
small
chapel
,
once
dedicate
to
Saint
John
the
Baptist

but
now
devote
to
a
less
sacred
purpose
.
<EOS>
as
they
advance

Leonard
observe
a
pile

a
stone
coffin
,
strip
of
woollen
shroud
,
fragment
of
coffin
,
mattock

and
spade

<EOS>
It
be
evidently
half
a
charnel
,
half
a
receptacle
for
the
sexton

<EOS>
"
if

by
main
force

<EOS>
He

as
his
raving

upon
the
most
loathly
matter

it
require
some
firmness

He

mumble
her

<EOS>
"
then
I

vociferate
Blaize

I
will
die
in

<EOS>
and
burst
from

he
would
have

<EOS>
at
the
sight
of

Blaize

back

screen
himself
behind
Patience

Hodges

scarcely
able

I
do
not

<EOS>
"
no

away

"

"
exclaim
Hodges

"
then
it
be
the

,
come
forward
,
young

,
and
let
us
see
what
be
the

You

without

I

<EOS>
You
have
be
read
some
silly
book
about
the

and
have
frighten
yourself
into
the
belief
that
you

of

I

likewise

It

"
remark
Leonard

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His

I

Leonard

shaving
,
saffron

and
syrup
of
wood
-
sorrel

<EOS>
I
long
to
taste
it
.
<EOS>
but
then
it
would
be
run
in
the
doctor
's
tooth
.
<EOS>
thirdly
,
there
be
a
phial
label
<EOS>
_
Aqua
Theriacalis

<EOS>
I
must

<EOS>
never
mind
the
doctor

<EOS>
He
do
not
know
what
agree
with
my
constitution
as
well
as
I

<EOS>
Physic
come
as
naturally

<EOS>
sixthly
,
there
be

I

clove

sovereign
fortifier
of
the
stomach

and
,
lastly
,
there
be
a
large
box

<EOS>
how
many
pill

I
take

<EOS>
only
half
a
dozen

<EOS>
three
more

well
go
to
keep
the
other
company

hastily
swallow
them

as
if
afraid

detection

carefully
shut

drawer

creep
into
bed

cover
himself
with
blanket

compose
himself
to
slumber

Doctor

return
to

him
that
it

free
from
infection

glad

so
often

when
the
danger
really
arrive

no
one
will
heed
him

"
I

now
take
my
leave

I

not
merely
take
care

be
well

Sir

high
spirit

boast
what

would
do

in
case
they
encounter
Disbrowe
,

offer
to
keep
guard
outside
the
door
while
the
knight
remain
in

house

but
he
now
begin
to
alter
his
tone
,
and
to
frame
excuse
to
get
away
.
<EOS>
He
have
notice
with
some
uneasiness
,
that
another
coach
stop
low
down
the
Haymarket
,
at
precisely
the
same
time
as
their
own
;
and
though
he
could
not
be
quite
certain
of
the
fact
,
he
fancy
he
perceive
a
person
greatly
resemble
Captain
Disbrowe
alight
from
it

<EOS>
mention
the
circumstance
to
his
companion

he
point
out
a
tall
figure

them
at
some
distance

the
other
only
laugh
at
him

say
,
"
It
may
possibly
be
Disbrowe

but
what
if
it
be
?
<EOS>
He
can
not
get
into
the
house
without
the
key
;

if
he
be
inclined
to
measure
sword
with

a
second
time

he
shall
not
escape
so
lightly

he

It
may
be

you
will
find

You
must
remain
at

I

the
moment

all

for

on

but
Parravicin
,
in
spite
of
his
passion
,
observe
far
more
caution
than
his
antagonist
;
and
,
take
advantage
of
an
unguarded
movement
,
occasion
by
the
other

impetuosity
,
pass
his
sword
through
his

lean
over
him

make
no

<EOS>
His

greatly
at

but
the

upon

they

<EOS>
His
excess
do
not

however
,
prevent
him
from

with
his

<EOS>
towards
the

of
May
,
the
bill
of
mortality
begin
to
swell
greatly
in
amount
,
and
though
but
few
be
put
down
to
the

,
and
a
large
number
to
the
spot
fever
(
another
frightful
disorder

at
the
period
)
,
it
be
well
known
that
the
bulk
have
die
of
the
former
disease
.
<EOS>
the
rigorous
measure
adopt
by
the
authority
(
whether
salutary
or
not
have
be
question
)
,
in
shut
up

and

within
them
for
forty
day
,
be
find
so
intolerable
,
that
most
person
be
dispose
to
run
any
risk
rather
than
be
subject
to
such
a
grievance
,
and
every
artifice
be
resort
to
for
conceal
a
case
when
it
occur
.
<EOS>
hence
,
it
seldom
happen
,
unless
by
accident
,
that
a
discovery
be
make
.
<EOS>
Quack
doctor
be
secretly
consult
,
instead
of
the
regular
practitioner
;
the
searcher
be
bribe
to
silence
;
and
large
fee
be
give
to
the
undertaker
and
burier
to
lay
the
death
to
the
account
of
some
other
disorder
.
<EOS>
all
this
,
however
,
do
not
blind
the
eye
of
the
officer
to
the
real
state
of
thing
.
<EOS>
redouble
their
vigilance
,
they
enter
house
on
mere
suspicion
;
inflict
punishment
where
they
find
their
order
disobey
or
neglect
;
send
the
sound
to
prison,--the
sick
to
the
pest
-
house
;
and
replace
the
faithless
searcher
by
other
upon
whom
they
could
place
reliance
.
<EOS>
many
case
be
thus
detect
;
but
in
spite
of
every
precaution
,
the
majority
escape
;
and
the
vent
be
no
sooner
stop
in
one
quarter
than
it
break
out
with
additional
violence
in
another
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
the
alarm
have
become
general
.
<EOS>
all
whose
business
or
pursuit
permit
it
,
prepared
to
leave
London
,
which
they
regard
as
a
devoted
city
,
without
delay
.
<EOS>
as
many
house
be
,
therefore
,
close
from
the
absence
of
the
inhabitant
as
from
the
presence
of
the
plague
,
and
this
add
to
the
forlorn
appearance
of
the
street
,
which
in
some
quarter
be
almost
desert
.
<EOS>
for
a
while
,
nothing
be
see
at
the
great
outlet
of
the
city
but
cart
,
carriage
,
and
other
vehicle
,
fill
with
good
and
movable
,
on
their
way
to
the
country
;
and
,
as
may
be
suppose
,
the
departure
of
their
friend
do
not
tend
to
abate
the
dejection
of
those
whose
affair
compel
them
to
remain
behind
.
 
<EOS>
one
circumstance
must
not
be
pass
unnoticed
,
namely
,
the
continue
fineness
and
beauty
of
the
weather
.
<EOS>
no
rain
have
fall
for
upward
of
three
week
.
<EOS>
the
sky
be
bright
and
cloudless
;
the
atmosphere
,
apparently
,
pure
and
innoxious
;
while
the
heat
be
as
great
as
be
generally
experience
in
the
middle
of
summer
.
<EOS>
but
instead
of
produce
its
usual
enlivening
effect
on
the
spirit
,
the
fine
weather
add
to
the
general
gloom
and
apprehension
,
inasmuch
as
it
lead
to
the
belief
(
afterwards
fully
confirm
)
,
that
if
the
present
warmth
be
so
pernicious
,
the
more
sultry
season
which
be
near
at
hand
would
aggravate
the
fury
of
the
pestilence
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
indeed
,
when
the
death
be
less
numerous
,
a
hope
begin
to
be
entertain
that
the
distemper
be
abate
,
and
confidence
be
for
a
moment
restore
;
but
these
anticipation
be
speedily
check
by
the
reappearance
of
the
scourge
,
which
seem
to
baffle
and
deride
all
human
skill
and
foresight
.
 
<EOS>
London
now
present
a
lamentable
spectacle
.
<EOS>
not
a
street
but
have
a
house
in
it
mark
with
a
red
cross
--
some
street
have
many
such
.
<EOS>
the
bell
be
continually
toll
for
burial
,
and
the
dead
-
cart
go
their
melancholy
round
at
night
and
be
constantly
load
.
<EOS>
fresh
direction
be
issue
by
the
authority
;
and
as
domestic
animal
be
consider
to
be
a
medium
of
convey
the
infection
,
an
order
,
which
be
immediately
carry
into
effect
,
be
give
to
destroy
all
dog
and
cat
.
<EOS>
but
this
plan
prove
prejudicial
rather
than
the
reverse
,
as
the
body
of
the
poor
animal
,
most
of
which

It

very
irksome

may

almost
intolerable

impatient
temperament

help
themselves
to
all
they

quit

premise

<EOS>
It
be
scarcely
necessary
to
track
their
course
further
;
and
it
may
be
sufficient
to
state
,
that
they
break
open
upward

fifty

<EOS>
many

the
result

bear
up

but
on
this
point
I
ought

under
any
circumstance

to

be
consult

I

I
have
no

I

caution
you

<EOS>
after
a

he
add

<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
she
do

Mrs.

it
be
from
that
conviction

continue
the

<EOS>
"

,
a
good

<EOS>
surprised--"I

<EOS>
nor

"
 
<EOS>
"
I

Leonard
;
"

she

where
they
find
Amabel

<EOS>
at

advise
conduct

<EOS>
I
be
come
for
a

<EOS>
You

nature
)
,

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
if

Amabel
,
in

voice
,
"
I
must
obey

it
will
make

wretched

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
I

<EOS>
"
I
value
your

more

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
deserve
well
treatment

Leonard

say
Bloundel
;
"
and
I
be
sorry
my

not
discern
what
be
for

<EOS>
let
us
hope
that
time
will
work
a
change
in
your
favour

"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
reply
the
apprentice
,
bitterly
;
"
I
will
no
longer
delude
myself
with
any
such
vain
expectation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Amabel
,
"
observe
the
grocer
,
"
as
your
father
--
as
your
wellwisher
--
I
should
desire
to
see
you
wed
to
Leonard
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
tell
your
mother
,
and
now
tell
you
,
that
I
will
not
control
your
inclination
,
and
will
only
attempt
to
direct
you
so
far
as
I
think
likely
to
be
conducive
to
your
happiness
.
<EOS>
on
another
point
,
I
must
assume
a
very
different
tone
.
<EOS>
You
can
no
longer
plead
ignorance
of
the
design
of
the
depraved
person
who
beset
you
.
<EOS>
You
may
not
be
able
to
forget
him
--
but
you
can
avoid
him
.
<EOS>
if
you
see
him
alone
again
--
if
but
for
a
moment
--
I
cast
you
off
for
ever

<EOS>
yes
,
for
ever
,
"
he
repeat
,
with
stern
emphasis
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
voluntarily
see
him
again

"
reply
Amabel
,
tremblingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
hear
my
determination

"
rejoin
her
father
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
still
adhere

<EOS>
he
add
,
turn
to
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
"
if
what
have
just
pass
make
any
alteration
in
your
wish

state
so

frankly

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
stay

Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
will
be
one
advantage
,
which
I
do
not
foresee
,
in
close
my
house

remark
the
grocer
aside
to
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
effectually
keep
away
this
libertine
earl
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
perhaps
so
,
"
reply
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
more
faith
in
my
own
vigilance
than
in
bolt
and
bar
.
<EOS>
"
 
Bloundel
and
Leonard
then
return
to
the
shop
,
where
the
former
immediately
begin
to
make
preparation
for
store
his
house
;
and
in
the
prosecution
of
his
scheme
he
be
greatly
aid
by
the
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
the
grocer
's
dwelling
,
as
have
be
state
,
be
large
and
commodious
.
<EOS>
It
be
three
story
high
;
and
beneath
the
ground
-
floor
there
be
kitchen
and
extensive
cellar
.
<EOS>
many
of
the
room
be
spacious
,
and
have
curiously
carve
fireplace
,
wall
pannelle
with
fine
brown
oak
,
large
press
,
and
cupboard
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
yard
,
at
the
back
of
the
house
,
there
be
a
pump
,
from
which
excellent
water
be
obtain
.
<EOS>
there
be
likewise
three
large
cistern
,
supply
from
the
New
River
.
<EOS>
not
satisfied
with
this
,
and
anxious
to
obtain
water
in
which
no
infect
body
could
have
lain
,
or
clothe
have
be
wash
,
Bloundel
have
a
large
tank
place
within
the
cellar
,
and
connect
it
by
pipe
with
the
pump
,
he
contrive
an
ingenious
machine
,
by
which
he
could
work
the
latter
from
within
the
house
--
thus
make
sure
of
a
constant
supply
of
water
direct
from
the
spring
.
 
<EOS>
He
next
address
himself
to
the
front
of
the
house
,
where
he
fix
a
pulley
,
with
a
rope
and
hook
attach
to
it
,
to
the
beam
above
one
of
the
small
bay
window
on
the
second
story
.
<EOS>
by
this
means
,
he
could
let
down
a
basket
or
any
other
article
into
the
street
,
or
draw
up
whatever
he
desire
;
and
as
he
propose
use
this
outlet
as
the
sole
mean
of
communication
with
the
external
world
when
his
house
be
closed
,
he
have
a
wooden
shutter
make
in
the
form
of
a
trap
-
door
,
which
he
could
open
and
shut
at
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
here
it
be
his
intention
to
station
himself
at
certain
hour
of
the
day
,
and
whenever
he
hold
any
communication
below
,
to
flash
off
a
pistol
,
so
that
the
smoke
of
the
powder
may
drive
back
the
air
,
and
purify
any
vapour
that
find
entrance
of
its
noxious
particle
.
 
<EOS>
He
lay
down
to
himself
a
number
of
regulation
,
which
will
be
more
easily
show
and
more
clearly
understand
,
on
arrive
at
the
period
when
his
plan
come
to
be
in
full
operation
.
<EOS>
to
give
an
instance
,
however
--
if
a
letter
should
be
convey
to
him
by
mean
of
the
pulley
,
he
propose
to
steep
it
in
a
solution
of
vinegar
and
sulphur
;
and
when
dry
and
otherwise
fumigate
,
to
read
it
at
a
distance
by
the
help
of
strong
glass
.
 
<EOS>
in
regard
to
provision
,
after
a
careful
calculation
,
he
buy
upwards
of
three
thousand
pound
'
weight
of
hard
sea
-
biscuit
,
similar
to
those
now
term
captain
's
biscuit
,
and
have
them
stow
away
in
hogshead
.
<EOS>
He
next
order
twenty
huge
cask
of
the
fine
flour
,
which
he
have
pack
up
with
the
great
care
,
as
if
for
a
voyage
to
Barbadoes
or
Jamaica
.
<EOS>
as
these
be
bring
in
through
the
yard
an
accident
have
well
-
nigh
occur
which
may
have
prove
fatal
to
him
.
<EOS>
while
superintend
the
labour
of
Leonard
and
Blaize
,
who
be
roll
the
cask
into
the
house
--
have
stow
away
as
many
as
he
conveniently
could
in
the
upper
part
of
the
premise
--
he
descend
to
the
cellar
,
and
,
open
a
door
at
the
foot
of
a
flight
of
step
lead
from
the
yard
,
call
to
them
to
lower
the
remain
barrel
with
rope
below
.
<EOS>
in
the
hurry
,
Blaize
roll
a
cask
towards
the
open
door
,
and
in
another
instant
it
would
have
fall
upon
the
grocer
,
and
perhaps
have
crush
him
,
but
for
the
interposition
of
Leonard
.
<EOS>
Bloundel
make
no
remark
at
the
time
;
but
he
never
forget
the
service

by
the
apprentice

<EOS>
to

for

.
<EOS>
neither
do
he
neglect
to
provide
himself
with
two
cask

<EOS>
but
the

be

;
and
for
this
purpose
he
go
to
Rotherhithe
,
where
the
plague

and
agree
with
a
butcher
to

him
four

and
pickle
and
barrel
them
as

<EOS>
He
likewise
direct
the

understanding
.
<EOS>
these

so
that
they
pass

Hams

have
promise
Blaize
to
give
him
her
earning
to
enable
him
to
procure
a
fresh
supply
of
medicine
,
and
about
a
week
after
he
have
receive
the
trifling
amount
(
for
he
have
be
so
constantly
employ
by
the
grocer
that
he
have
no
opportunity

get
out
before

,
he
sally
forth
to
visit
a
neighbouring
apothecary
,
name
Parkhurst
,
from
whom
he
have
be
in
the
habit
of
purchase
drug
,
and
who
occupy
a
small
shop
not
far
from
the
grocer
's
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
.
<EOS>
Parkhurst
appear
overjoyed
to
see
him
,
and
,
without
give
him
time
to
prefer
his
own
request
,
inquire
after
his
master
's
family
--
whether
they
be
all
well
,
especially
fair
Mistress
Amabel
--
and
,
further
,
what
be
the
meaning
of
the
large
supply
of
provision
which
he
see
daily
convey
to
the
premise
?
<EOS>
Blaize
shake
his
head
at
the
latter
question
,
and
for
some
time
refuse
to
answer
it
.
<EOS>
but
be
closely
press
by
Parkhurst
,
he
admit
that
his
master
be
about
to
shut
up
his
house

<EOS>
"
shut
up

house
!

Parkhurst

<EOS>
"
I
never
hear
of
such
a
preposterous
idea

if
he
do
so
,
not
one
of
you
will
come
out
alive

I

dissuade

"
You
do

I

forth

<EOS>
"
It
be

serious

gravely

exorbitant

so

he

study

taste
their
content

full
a

I

long

he

;

I
have
more
difficulty
with
the
doctor

I
expect
,

for
some
time
he
refuse

see
you
on
any
term

because
he
have
a
violent
antipathy
to
Doctor

I

smooth
the

you
will
find

very
affable

condescending

<EOS>
He
have
often
hear
me
speak
of
your

if
it

I

could
get

"
I

so
too

there
would
be
no

parkhurst

<EOS>
"
but
you
shall
now
see
the
learned
gentleman

<EOS>
I
ought
to
apprise
you

with
him

one
a
young
gallant

name
Hawkswood

whom
he
have
recently
cure
of
the
distemper

and
who
be
so
much
attach
to
him
that
he
never
leave
him
;
the
other
,
a
doctor
,
like
himself
,
name
Martin
Furbisher
,
who
always
accompany
him
in
his
visit
to
his
patient
,
and
prepare
his
mixture
for
him
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
be
surprised
at
their
appearance
.
<EOS>
and
now
come
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
with
this
,
he
lead
the
way
into
a
small
room
at
the
back
of
the
shop
,
where
three
personage
be
seat
at
the
table
,
with
a
flask
of
wine
and
glass
before
them
.
<EOS>
Blaize
detect
Doctor
Bottesham
at
a
glance
.
<EOS>
He
be
an
ancient
-
looking
man
,
clothe
in
a
suit
of
rusty
black
,
over
which
be
throw
a
velvet
robe
,
very
much
soiled
and
fade
,
but
originally
trim
with
fur
,
and
line
with
yellow
silk
.
<EOS>
His
power
of
vision
appear
to
be
feeble
,
for
he
wear
a
large
green
shade
over
his
eye
,
and
a
pair
of
spectacle
of
the
same
colour
.
<EOS>
a
venerable
white
beard
descend
almost
to
his
waist
.
<EOS>
His
head
be
protect
by
a
long
flow
grey
wig
,
over
which
he
wear
a
black
velvet
cap
.
<EOS>
His
shoulder
be
high
and
round
,
his
back
bent
,
and
he
evidently
require
support
when
he
move
,
as
a
crutch
-
head
staff
be
rear
against
his
chair
.
<EOS>
on
his
left
be
a
young
,
handsome
,
and
richly
-
attire
gallant
,
answer
to
the
apothecary
's
description
of
Hawkswood
;
and
on
the
right
sit
a
stout
personage
precisely
habit
like
himself
,
except
that
he
wear
a
broad
-
leaved
hat
,
which
completely
overshadow
his
feature
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
attempt
at
concealment
,
it
be
easy
to
perceive
that
Doctor
Furbisher
's
face
be
cover
with
scar
,
that
he
have
a
rubicund
nose
,
stud
with
carbuncle
,
and
a
black
patch
over
his
left
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
this
the
young
man
who
desire
to
consult
me
?
"
ask
Doctor
Calixtus
Bottesham
,
in
the
cracked
and
quaver
voice
of
old
age
,
of
Parkhurst
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
,
"
reply
the
apothecary
,
respectfully
.
"
<EOS>
go
forward
,

add
to
Blaize

"

speak
for
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
ail
you

"
<EOS>
pursue
Bottesham
,
gaze
at
him
through
his
spectacle

<EOS>
"
You
look
strong

hearty

"
 
<EOS>
"
so
I
be
,
learned
sir
,
"
reply
Blaize
,
bow
to
the
ground
;
"
but
understanding
from
Mr.
Parkhurst
that
you
have
an
infallible
remedy
against
the
plague
,
I
would
gladly
procure
it
from
you
,
as
,
if
I
should
be
attack
,
I
may
not
have
an
opportunity

consult
you

"
 
<EOS>
"
why
not

Bottesham

<EOS>
"
I
will
come
to
you

you
send
for
me

because
,

Blaize

after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
"
<EOS>
my

about

up

end

no

the

the
way

when
do
your

talk

put
this

into
execution

Bottesham

very
shortly

I
believe

Blaize

<EOS>
He
mean
to
begin
on
the
first
of
June
,

as
the
pestilence
be
less
violent
than
it
be
,
Doctor
Hodges
have
induce
him
to
defer
his
purpose
for
a
few
day
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Doctor
Hodges
!
"
exclaim
Bottesham
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
an
unfortunate
day
for
your
master
when
he
admit
that
sack

drinking
impostor
into
his
house

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
great
opinion
of
his
skill

reply
Blaize
,
"
but
,
nevertheless
,
it
must
be
admit
that
he
cure
Master
Stephen
in

wonderful
manner

"
 
<EOS>
"
Pshaw
!
"
exclaim
Bottesham
,
"
that
be
mere
accident
.
<EOS>
I
hear
the
particular
of
the
case
from
Parkhurst
,
and
be
satisfy
the
youth
would
have
recover
without
his
aid
.
<EOS>
but
what
a
barbarian
Mr.
Bloundel
must
be
to
think
of
imprison
his
family
in
this
way
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
certainly
do
not
consult
my
inclination
in
the
matter

return
Blaize

<EOS>

nor
those
of

<EOS>
how
do

the
ravage

the

five

beautiful

totally
out
of

in

a
blemish
to
it

<EOS>
insensible
alike
to
the
beauty
or
defect
of
the
majestic
building

regard
it
only
as
the
prison
of

it
carefully
on

side

he
determine
to
make
the
complete
circuit
of
the

with
this
view
he
shape
his
course
towards
the
east

<EOS>
He
find
two
small

opening
upon

to
Saint

this
be
secure
like
the
other

think
it
vain
to

time
in

it

his
course

<EOS>
skirt
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
fane

then
the
most
beautiful
part
of

till
he
come
to
the
great
southern
portal
,
the
pillar
and
arch
of
which
differ
but
slightly
in
character
from
those
of
the
northern
entrance
.
 
<EOS>
here
he
knock
as
before
,
and
be
answer
,
as
on
the
former
occasion
,
by
sullen
echo
from
within
.
<EOS>
when
these
sound
die
away
,
he
place
his
ear
to
the
huge
key
-
hole
in
the
wicket
,
but
could
not
even
catch
the
fall
of
a
footstep
.
<EOS>
neither
could
he
perceive
any
light
,
except
that
afford
by
the
moonbeam
,
which
flood
the
transept
with
radiance
.
 
<EOS>
again
hurry
on
,
he
pass
the
cloister
-
wall
surround
the
Convocation
House
;
try
another
door
between
that
building
and
the
church
of
Saint
Gregory
,
a
small
fane
attach
to
the
large
structure
;
and
fail
in
open
it
,
turn
the
corner
and
approach
the
portico,--the
principal
entrance
to
the
cathedral
being
then
,
as
now
,
on
the
west
.
 
<EOS>
Erected
,
as
before
mention
,
from
the
design
of
the
celebrated
Inigo
Jones
,
this
magnificent
colonnade
be
complete
about
1640
,
at
which
time
preparation
be
make
for
repair
the
cathedral
throughout
,
and
for
strengthen
the
tower
,
for
enable
it
to
support
a
new
spire
.
<EOS>
but
this
design
,
owe
to
the
disorganised
state
of
affair
,
be
never
carry
into
execution
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
time
of
the
Commonwealth
,
while
the
interior
of
the
sacred
fabric
undergo
every
sort
of
desecration
and
mutilation,--while
stone
be
tear
from
the
pavement
,
and
monumental
brass
from
tombs,--while
carved
stall
be
burn
,
and
statue
pluck
from
their
niches,--a
similar
fate
attend
the
portico
.
<EOS>
shop
be
build
beneath
it
,
and
the
sculpture
ornament
its
majestic
balustrade
be
throw
down
.
 
<EOS>
amongst
other
obstruction
,
it
appear
that
there
be
a
"
high
house
in
the
north
angle
,
which
hinder
the
mason
from
repair
that
part
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
the
marble
door
-
case
,
the
capital
,
cornice
,
and
pillar
be
so
much
injure
by
the
fire
make
against
them
,
that
it
require
month
to
put
them
in
order
.
<EOS>
at
the
Restoration
,
Sir
John
Denham
,
the
poet
,
be
appoint
surveyor
-
general
of
the
work
,
and
continue
to
hold
the
office
at
the
period
of
this
history
.
 
<EOS>
as
Leonard
draw
near
the
portico
,
he
perceive
,
to
his
surprise
,
that
a
large
concourse
of
people
be
collect
in
the
area
in
front
of
it
;
and
,
rush
forward
,
he
find
the
assemblage
listen
to
the
denunciation
of
Solomon
Eagle
,
who
be
stand
in
the
midst
of
them
with
his
brazier
on
his
head
.
<EOS>
the
enthusiast
appear
more
than
usually
excited
.
<EOS>
He
be
toss
aloft
his
arm
in
a
wild
and
frenzied
manner
,
and
seem
to
be
direct
his
menace
against
the
cathedral
itself
.
 
<EOS>
hope
to
obtain
assistance
from
the
crowd
,
Leonard
resolve
to
await
a
fitting
period
to
address
them
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
he
join
them
,
and
listen
to
the
discourse
of
the
enthusiast
.
 
<EOS>
"
hear
me
!
"
<EOS>
cry
the
latter
,
in
a
voice
of
thunder
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
vision
last
night
and
will
relate
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
during
my
brief
slumber
,
I

I
be
stand
on
this
very
spot

and
gaze
as
now
upon
yon
mighty
structure

<EOS>
on
a
sudden
the
day
become
overcast
,
and
ere
long
it
grow
pitchy
dark
.
<EOS>
then
be
hear
a
noise
of
rush
wing
in
the
air
,
and
I
could
just
discern
many
strange
figure
hover
above
the
tower
,
utter
doleful
cry
and
lamentation
.
<EOS>
all
at
once
these
figure
disappear
,
and
give
place
to
,
or
,
it
may
be
,
be
chase
away
by
,
other
of
more
hideous
appearance
.
<EOS>
the
latter
bring
light
brand
which
they
hurl
against
the
sacred

and
,
in
an
instant
,
flame
burst
forth
from
it
on
all
side

<EOS>
My

it
be
a
fearful

a
glorious
sight

see
that
vast

the
flame
be
so
vivid

so
intense

that
I

not

to
look
upon

I
cover
my
face
with
my
hand

<EOS>
on
raise
my
eye
again
the
flame

the
building

utterly
in
ruin
--
its
column
crack
--
its
tower
hurl
from
its
place
--
its
ponderous
roof
lay
low

<EOS>
It
be
a
mournful
spectacle

a
terrible
proof
of
the
Divine
wrath
and
vengeance

<EOS>
yes

my

the
temple
of
the
Lord

be
profane

It
have
be
the
scene

Leonard

a
slight
circumstance

for
a
few
minute

during
which
time
he
have
sufficient
leisure
to
note
the
extraordinary
personal
attraction
of
Nizza
Macascree
.
 
<EOS>
in
age
she

about
seventeen

differ
in
the
character

her
beauty

as
well

in
the
natural
gracefulness

from
all
the

Her
feature

Her
skin

more
attractive

<EOS>
Her
eye
be
luminous
as
the
star

and
black
as
midnight
;
while
her
raven

beneath

Her
attire
be

Leonard
give
up
the

his

soon
compel
from

desist

<EOS>
Judith
have
carry
away
the
lantern
,
he
be
leave
in
total
darkness
;
but
on
search
the
cell
,
which
be
about
four
foot
wide
and
six
deep
,
he
discover
a
narrow
grated
loophole
.
<EOS>
by
dint
of
great
exertion
,
and
with
the
help
of
his
sword
,
which
snap
in
twain
as
he
use
it
,
he
manage
to
force
off
one
of
the
rusty
bar
,
and
to
squeeze
himself
through
the
aperture
.
<EOS>
all
his
labour
,
however
,
be
throw
away
.
<EOS>
the
loophole
open
on
the
south
side
of
the
tower
,
near
one
of
the
large
buttress
,
which
project
several
yard
beyond
it
on
the
left
,
and
be
more
than
twenty
foot
above
the
roof
;
so
that
it
would
be
certain
destruction
to
drop
from
so
great
a
height
.
 
<EOS>
the
night
be
overcast
,
and
the
moon
hide
behind
thick
cloud
.
<EOS>
still
,
there
be
light
enough
to
enable
him
to
discern
the
perilous
position
in
which
he
stand
.
<EOS>
after
gaze
below
for
some
time
,
Leonard
be
about
to
return
to
the
cell
,
when
,
cast
his
eye
upwards
,
he
think
he
perceive
the
end
of
a
rope
about
a
foot
above
his
head
,
dangle
from
the
upper
part
of
the
structure
.
<EOS>
no
sooner
be
this
discovery
make
,
than
it
occur
to
him
that
he
may
possibly
liberate
himself
by
this
unlooke
for
aid
;
and
,
regardless
of
the
risk
he
run
,
he
spring
upwards
and
catch
hold
of
the
rope
.
<EOS>
It
be
firmly
fasten
above
,
and
sustain
his
weight
well
.
 
<EOS>
possess
of
great
bodily
strength
and
activity
,
and
nerve
by
desperation
,
Leonard
Holt
place
his
foot
against
the
buttress
,
and
impel
himself
towards
one
of
the
tall
pointed
window
light
the
interior
of
the
tower
;
but
though
he
reach
the
point
at
which
he
aim
,
the
sway
of
the
rope
drag
him
back
before
he
could
obtain
a
secure
grasp
of
the
stone
shaft
;
and
,
after
another
ineffectual
effort
,
fearful
of
exhaust
his
strength
,
he
abandon
the
attempt
,
and
begin
to
climb
up
the
rope
with
his
hand
and
knee
.
<EOS>
aid
by
the
inequality
of
the
roughen
wall
,
he
soon
gain
a
range
of
small
Saxon
arch
ornament
the
tower
immediately
beneath
the
belfry
,
and
succeed
in
plant
his
right
foot
on
the
moulding
of
one
of
them
;
he
instantly
steady
himself
,
and
with
little
further
effort
clamber
through
an
open
window
.
 
<EOS>
His
first
act
on
reach
the
belfry
be
to
drop
on
his
knee
,
and
return
thank
to
Heaven
for
his
deliverance
.
<EOS>
He
then
look
about
for
an
outlet
;
but
though
a
winding
staircase
exist
in
each
of
the
four
angle
of
the
tower
,
all
the
door
,
to
his
infinite
disappointment
,
be
fasten
on
the
other
side

<EOS>
He
be
still
,
therefore
,
a
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
determined
,
however
,
not
to
yield
to
despair
,
he
continue
his
search
,
and
find
a
small
door
opening
upon
a
staircase
communicate
with
the
summit
of
the
tower
,
he
unfasten
it
(
for
the
bolt
be
on
his
own
side
)
,
and
hurry
up
the
step
.
<EOS>
pass
through
another
door
bolt
like
the
first
within
side
,
he
issue
upon
the
roof
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
on
the
high
part
of
the
cathedral
,
and
farther
from
his
hope
than
ever
;
and
so
agonizing
be
his
feeling
,
that
he
almost
feel
tempt
to
fling
himself
headlong
downward
.
<EOS>
beneath
him
lie
the
body
of
the
mighty
fabric
,
its
vast
roof
,
its
crocketed
pinnacle
,
its
buttress
and
battlement
scarcely
discernible
through
the
gloom
,
but
look
like
some
monstrous
engine
devise
to
torture
him
.
 
<EOS>
weary
with
gaze
at
it
,
and
convince
of
the
futility
of
any
further
attempt
at
descent
,
Leonard
Holt
return
to
the
belfry
,
and
,
throw
himself
on
the
board
floor
,
seek
some
repose
.
<EOS>
the
fatigue
he
have
undergo
be
so
great
,
that
,
notwithstanding
his
anxiety
,
he
soon
drop
asleep
,
and
do
not
awake
for
several
hour
.
<EOS>
on
open
his
eye
,
it
be
just
get
light
,
and
shake
himself
,
he
again
prepare
for
action
.
<EOS>
all
the
event
of
the
night
rush
upon
his
mind
,
and
he
think
with
unutterable
anguish
of
Amabel
's
situation
.
<EOS>
glance
round
the
room
,
it
occur
to
him
that
he
may
give
the
alarm
by
ring
the
enormous
bell
near
him
;
but
though
he
set
them
slightly
in
motion
,
he
could
not
agitate
the
immense
clapper
sufficiently
to
produce
any
sound
.
 
<EOS>
resolve
,
however
,
to
free
himself
at
any
hazard
,
he
once
more
repair
to
the
summit
of
the
tower
,
and
lean
over
the
balustrade
,
gaze
below
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
sublime
spectacle
,
and
,
in
spite
of
his
distress
,
fill
him
with
admiration
and
astonishment
.
<EOS>
He
have
station
himself
on

It

the
magnificent

<EOS>
on

on

the

while
nearer

<EOS>
a
little
to

the
borough
of
Southwark
,
even
then
a
large
and
populous
district
--
<EOS>
the
two
most
prominent
feature
in
the
scene
be
Winchester
House
,
and
Saint

old
and
beautiful
church

<EOS>
fill
with
wonder
at
what
he
see
,
Leonard
look
towards
the
east
,
and
here
an
extraordinary
prospect
meet
his
gaze
.
<EOS>
the
whole
of
the
city
of
London
be
spread
out
like
a
map
before
him
,
and
present
a
dense
mass
of
ancient
house
,
with
twisted
chimney
,
gable
,
and
picturesque
roof
--
here
and
there
overtop
by
a
hall
,
a
college
,
an
hospital
,
or
some
other
lofty
structure
.
<EOS>
this
vast
collection
of
building
be
gird
in
by
grey
and
mouldering
wall
,
approach
by
seven
gate
,
and
intersect
by
innumerable
narrow
street
.
<EOS>
the
spire
and
tower
of
the
church
shoot
up
into
the
clear
morning
air
--
for
,
except
in
a
few
quarter
,
no
smoke
yet
issue
from
the
chimney
.
<EOS>
on
this
side
,
the
view
of
the
city
be
terminate
by
the
fortification
and
keep
of
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
little
do
the
apprentice
think
,
when
he
look
at
the
magnificent
scene
before
him
,
and
marvel
at
the
countless
building
he
behold
,
that
,
ere
fifteen
month
have
elapse
,
the
whole
mass
,
together
with
the
mighty
fabric
on
which
he
stand
,
would
be
sweep
away
by
a
tremendous
conflagration
.
<EOS>
unable
to
foresee
this
direful
event
,
and
lament
only
that
so
fair
<EOS>
a
city
should
be
a
prey
to
an
exterminating
pestilence
,
he
turn
towards
the
north
,
and
suffer
his
gaze
to
wander
over
finsbury
-
field
,
and
the
hilly
ground
beyond
them
--
over
Smithfield
and
Clerkenwell
,
and
the
beautiful
open
country
adjoin
Gray's
-
inn
-
lane
.
 
<EOS>
so
smile
and
beautiful
<EOS>
do
these
district
appear
,
that
ha
could
scarcely
fancy
they
be
the
chief
haunt
of
the
horrible
distemper
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
blind
himself
to
the
fact
that
in
finsbury
-
field
,
as
well
as
in
the
open
country
to
the
north
of
Holborn
,
plague
-
pit
have
be
digge
and
pest
-
house
erect
;
and
this
consideration
throw
such
a
gloom
over
the
prospect
,
that
,
in
order
to
dispel
the
effect
,
he
change
the
scene
by
look
towards
the
west
.
<EOS>
here
his
view
embrace
all
the
proud
mansion
of
the
capital
,
and
trace
the
Strand
to
Charing
Cross
,
long
since
rob
of
the
beautiful
structure
from
which
it
derive
its
name
,
and
notice
its
numerous
noble
habitation
,
his
eye
finally
rest
upon
Whitehall
:
and
he
heave
a
sigh
as
he
think
that
the
palace
of
the
sovereign
be
infect
by
as
foul
a
moral
taint
as
the
hideous
disease
that
ravage
the
dwelling
of
his
subject
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
time
that
Leonard
Holt
gaze
upon
the
capital
,
its
picturesque
beauty
be
nearly
at
their
close
.
<EOS>
in
a
little
more
than
a
year
and
a
quarter
afterwards
,
the
great
part
of
the
old
city
be
consume
by
fire
;
and
though
it
be
rebuild
,
and
in
many
respect
improve
,
its
original
and
picturesque
character
be
entirely
destroy
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
scarcely
possible
to
conceive
a
fine
view
than
can
be
gain
from
the
dome
of
the
modern
cathedral
at
sunrise
on
a
May
morning
,
when
the
prospect
be
not
dim
by
the
smoke
of
a
hundred
thousand
chimney
--
when
the
river
be
just
begin
to
stir
with
its
numerous
craft
,
or
when
they
be
sleep
on
its
glisten
bosom
--
when
every
individual
house
,
court
,
church
,
square
,
or
theatre
,
can
be
discern
--
when
the
eye
can
range
over
the
whole
city
on
each
side
,
and
calculate
its
vast
extent
.
<EOS>
It
seem
scarcely
possible
,
we
say
,
to
suppose
at
any
previous
time
it
could
be
more
striking
;
and
yet
,
at
the
period
under
consideration
,
it
be
incomparably
more
so
.
<EOS>
then
,
every
house
be
picturesque
,
and
every
street
a
collection
of
picturesque
object
.
<EOS>
then
,
that
which
be
objectionable
in
itself
,
and
contribute
to
the
insalubrity
of
the
city
,
namely
,
the
extreme
narrowness
of
the
street
,
and
overhang
story
of
the
house
,
be
the
main
source
of
their
beauty
.
<EOS>
then
,
the
huge
projecting
sign
with
their
fantastical
iron
-
work
--
the
conduit
--
the
crosse
(
where
crosse
remained)--the
maypole
--
all
be
picturesque
;
and
as
superior
to
what
can
now
be
see
,
as
the
attire
of
Charles
the
Second
's
age
be
to
the
ugly
and
disfigure
costume
of
our
own
day
.
 
<EOS>
satiate
with
this
glorious
prospect
,
Leonard
begin
to
recur
to
his
own
situation
,
and
carefully
scrutinize
every
available
point
on
the
side
of
the
Tower
,
he
think
it
possible
to
effect
his
descent
by
clamber
down
the
gradation
of
one
of
the
buttress
.
<EOS>
still
,
as
this
experiment
would
be
attend
with
the
utmost
danger
,
while
,
even
if
he
reach
the
roof
,
he
would
yet
be
far
from
his
object
,
he
resolve
to
defer
it
for
a
short
time
,
in
the
hope
that
ere
long
seine
of
the
bell
-
ringers
,
or
other
person
connect
with
the
cathedral
,
may
come
thither
and
set
him
free
.
 
<EOS>
while
thus
commune
with
himself
,
he
hear
a
door
open
below
;
and
hurry
down
the
stair
at
the
sound
,
he
behold
,
to
his
great
surprise
and
joy
,
the
piper
's
daughter
,
Nizza
Macascree
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
search
for
you
everywhere
,
"
she
cry
,
"
and
begin
to
think
some
ill
have
befall
you
.
<EOS>
I
overhear
<EOS>
Judith
Malmayns
say
she
have
shut
you
up
in
a
cell
in
the
upper
part
of
the
tower

<EOS>
how
do
you
escape
thence
?
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
hastily
explain
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
I
should
never
forget
the
service
you
render
me
in

the
life
of
poor
Bell

pursue
Nizza
,
"
and
what
I
have
do
will
prove
I
be
not
unmindful
of
my
promise
<EOS>
I
see
you
search
the
cathedral
last
night
with
Judith
,
and
notice
that
she
return
from
the
tower
unaccompanie
by
you
.
<EOS>
at
first
I
suppose
you
may
have
leave
the
cathedral
without
my
observe
you
,
and
I
be
further
confirm
in
the
idea
by
what
I
subsequently
hear
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
"
exclaim
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
you

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
follow
Judith
to
the
vault
of

It
do

Nizza

<EOS>
"
They
be
by
this

more
than
half
intoxicate
by
the

They

when
,
have
station
myself
behind
one
of
the
massive
pillar
in
the
north
aisle
of
Saint

--
for
I
suspect
something
be
wrong
--
I
observe
Judith
and
Chowles
steal
across
the
nave
,
and
proceed
towards
the
vestry
.
<EOS>
the
former
tap
at
the
door

and
they
be
instantly
admit
by
Mr.

the
minor
canon

<EOS>
hasten
to
the
door

which
be
leave
slightly
ajar

I
perceive
two
young
gallant

I
hear
address
as
the
Earl
of
Rochester

Sir
George
Etherege
,
and
a
young
female

who
I
could
not
doubt
be
Amabel

<EOS>
the
earl

his
companion
laugh
heartily
at
the
trick
Judith
have
play
you

and
which
the
latter
detail
to
them
;
but
Amabel
take
no
part
in

merriment

but
,
on
the
contrary

look
very
grave

even
weep

Wept

<EOS>
cry
Leonard

in

there

You

Can

passionately

I

Nizza

"
You
know
not

it
be

the

you

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

perhaps
not

I

and
,
feel
she
have
say
too
much

she
blush
deeply

cast
down
her
eye

<EOS>
unconscious
of
her
confusion

entirely
engross
by
the
thought

his
mistress

tell

You

She

<EOS>
on
learn
you

find
that

lock
it

remove

not

for
I

gather
from

that
the

pay

I
determine
to
await
a
favourable
opportunity

accordingly
I
return

by

another

it

He
inform
the

distress
at
his

advise
him
to
lose

convey
her

these
tiding
trouble
Amabel
exceedingly

by
promise

espouse
her
at

how

I

and
when
she
depart
to
the
crypt
near
the
charnel

with
Amabel

I
possess
myself
of
it

<EOS>
for
some
time
I
be
unable

use
it

because
the
Earl
of
Rochester
and
Sir
George
Etherege
keep
pace
to

fro
in
front
of
the
door
,
and
their
discourse
convince
me
that
the
marriage
be
mean
to
be
a
feign
one

for
Sir
George
strove
to
dissuade
his
friend
from
the
step
he
be
about
to
take
;

the
other
only
laugh
at
his
scruple

as
soon
as
they
retire

which
be
not
more
than
half
an

I
unlock
the
door

hurry
up
the
winding

<EOS>
I
search
every
chamber

begin
to
think
you
be
go

statement

false

I
resolve
to
continue
my
search

I
be
fully
satisfied

You

You

Leonard

us
now

there

WALK

<EOS>
It
will
now
be
necessary
to
ascertain
what
take
place
at
the
grocer
's
habitation
subsequently
to
Amabel
's
abduction
.
<EOS>
Leonard
Holt
have

when

a
noise
in

,
peep
cautiously
out
at
the
back

door
,
and
inquire
who
be
there
?
 
<EOS>
"
be

Mr.
Bloundel

"
rejoin
Pillichody
,
bethink
him
of
a

<EOS>
do
not

Bernard
Boutefeu

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

any

of
that
name

and
I
can
not
discern
your
feature

Blaize

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
your
voice
sound
familiar
to
me

<EOS>
what
be

<EOS>
"
I

answer
Pillichody

but
he
have
accomplish
his

<EOS>
"
here
be
a

piece
of
news
for
my

<EOS>
but
how
do
you
discover
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
chancing
to
pass
along
the
entry
on
the
other
side
of
that
wall
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
,
"
return
Pillichody
,
"
I
perceive
a
rope
-
ladder
fasten
to
it
,
and
wish
to
ascertain
what
be
the
matter
,
I
mount
it
,
and
have
scarcely
get
over
into
the
yard
,
when
I
see
two
person
advance
.
<EOS>
I
conceal
myself
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
wall
,
and
they
do
not
notice
me
;
but
I
gather
from
their
discourse
who
they
be
and
what
be
their
design
.
<EOS>
I
allow
Amabel
to
ascend
,
but
just
as
the
apprentice
be
follow
,
I
lay
hold
of
the
skirt
of
his
doublet
,
and
,
pull
him
back
,
desire
him
to
come
with
me
to
his
master
.
<EOS>
He
answer
by
draw
his
sword
,
and
would
have
stab
me
,
but
I
close
with
him
,
and
should
have
secure
him
if
my
foot
have
not
slip
.
<EOS>
while
I
be
on
the
ground
,
he
deal
me
a
severe
blow
,
and
run
after
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
just
like
him

reply
Blaize
.
"
<EOS>
He
take
the

cowardly
advantage
of
me
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
punishment
will
be
too
severe
for
him
,
"
rejoin
Pillichody
,
"
and
I
hope
your
master
will
make
a
terrible
example
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
fortunate
I
be
not
go
to
bed
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Blaize
,
"
I
have
just
take
a
couple
of
rufuse

be
about

rush
upstairs

on

to
Mr.
Bloundel
's
chamber
,
he
meet
Patience
,
and
tell
her
what
he
have
hear
.
<EOS>
She
be
inclined
to
put
a
very
different
construction
on
the
story
;
but
as
she
bear
the
apprentice
<EOS>
no
particular
good
-
will
,
she
determine
to
keep
her
opinion
to
herself
,
and
let
affair
take
their
course
.
<EOS>
the
grocer
be
soon
arouse
,
and
scarcely
able
to
credit
the
porter
's
intelligence
,
and
yet
fear
something
must
be
wrong
,
he
hastily
attire
himself
,
and
proceed
to
Amabel
's
room
.
<EOS>
It
be
empty
,
and
it
be
evident
from
the
state
in
which
everything
be
leave
,
that
she
have
never
retire
to
rest

<EOS>
confound
by
the
sight

Bloundel
then
hurry
downstairs
in
search
of

by

"
Leonard
could
have
no
motive
for
act
thus

<EOS>
He
have
our
consent
to
the
union

obstacle

Amabel
herself

he
be
desperately

that
be
certain

when

I
be
tell
they
do
very

perhaps
he
may
have
carry

off
against
her

<EOS>

very
likely

rejoin
Blaize

<EOS>
"
I
think
I
hear
a
scream

should
have
call
out
at
the

minute

greatly
enrage
when

get
off
.
<EOS>
no
longer
doubt
that
he
have
be
rob
of
his
daughter
by
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
abandon
her
to
her
fate
,
and
his
conflicting
feeling
occasion
him
a
night
of
indescribable
anxiety

<EOS>
the
party
of
watch
whom
he
have
summon
search
the
street
for
him
,
and
endeavour
to
trace
out
the
fugitives,--but
without
success
;
and
they
return
before
daybreak
to
report
their
failure

<EOS>
about
six
o'clock
,
Mr.
Bloundel
,
unable
to
restrain
himself
longer
,
sally
forth
with
Blaize
in
search
of
his
daughter
and
Leonard
.
<EOS>
Uncertain
where
to
bend
his
step
,
he
trust
to
chance
to
direct
him
,
resolve
,
if
he
be
unsuccessful
,
to
lay
a
petition
for
redress
before
the
throne
.
<EOS>
proceed
along
Cheapside
,
he
enter
Paternoster
-
row
,
and
traverse
it
till
he
come
to
Paul
's
Alley,--a
narrow
passage
lead
to
the
north
-
west
corner
of
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
prompt
by
an
unaccountable
impulse
,
he
no
sooner
catch
sight
of
the
reverend
structure
,
than
he
hasten
,
towards
it
,
and
knock
against
the
great
northern
door
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
,
however
,
precede
him
,
and
return
to
the
party
at
the
altar
.
<EOS>
the
awful
warning
of
Solomon
Eagle
so
alarm
Quatremain
,
that
he
let
fall
his
prayer
-
book
,
and
after
gaze
vacantly
round
for
a
few
moment
,
stagger
to
one
of
the
stall
,
where
,
feel
a
burn
pain
in
his
breast
,
he
tear
open
his
doublet
,
and
find
that
the
enthusiast
have
speak
the
truth
,
and
that
he
be
really
attack
by
the
pestilence
.
<EOS>
as
to
Amabel
,
on
hear
the
terrible
denunciation
,
she
utter
a
loud
cry
,
and
would
have
fall
to
the
ground
but
for
the
timely
assistance
of
the
apprentice
,
who
catch
her
with
one
arm
,
while
with
the
other
he
defend
himself
against
the
earl
and
his
companion
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
in
spite
of
his
resistance
,
they
would
have
soon
compel
him
to
relinquish
his
charge
,
if
Solomon
Eagle
,
who
have
hitherto
content
himself
with
gaze
sternly
on
what
be
pass
,
have
not
interfere
;
and
,
rush
towards
the
combatant
,
seize
Rochester
and
Etherege
,
and
hurl
them
backwards
with
almost
supernatural
force
.
<EOS>
when
they
arise
,
and
menace
him
with
their
sword
,
he
laugh
loudly
and
contemptuously
,
cry
,
"
Advance
,
if
ye
dare
!
<EOS>
and
try
your
strength
against
one
arm
by
Heaven
,
and
ye
will

discern

perfect
motion

jostle

<EOS>
It

a
heap

nothing

the
good

chat
with

listen
to

break
their
fast

as

one
as
stern

steady
,
if

a
deep
silence
prevail
for
a
few
minute
,
during

each
fancy

the
nurse

revolve
some
desperate
expedient

she
keep
on
her
guard

lest
an
attack
should

and
some
such

in

she
resolve

no

without

he
pursue

traverse
another
long

narrow
passage

<EOS>
"
where

I
will
take

down

bury
in

her
an
idea

<EOS>
proceed
towards
the
west
,
Solomon

go
in

<EOS>
Nizza
do
not
require
a
second
exhortation
,
but
quit
the
cell
,
and
notice
its
situation
,
swiftly
descend
the
winding
staircase
,

hurry
along
the
northern
aisle

proceed
to
a
small
chamber

extremity

her
errand

him
to
remain
on
the
watch

Doctor
Hodges

<EOS>
the
verger
promise
compliance
;
and
,
open
a
wicket
in

great
doorway

allow
her
to
go
forth

a

second
bring

I
take

great

He
must
not

<EOS>
how
come
he
at
Saint
Paul

,
I
wonder
?
<EOS>
but
I
can
obtain
information
on
that
point
as
I
go
thither
.
<EOS>
no
time
must
be
lose
.
"
 
<EOS>
ruminate
thus
,
he
swallow
a
glass
of
sack
,
and
provide
himself
with
a
case
of
instrument
,
and
such
medicine
as
he
think
he
may
require
,
he
descend
to
Nizza
.
<EOS>
on
the
way
to
the
cathedral
,
she
acquaint
him
with
what
have
befall
Leonard
during
the
last
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
,
and
the
only
circumstance
that
she
keep
back
be
Judith
's
attempt
on
his
life
.
<EOS>
this
she
intend
to
reveal
at
a
more
fitting
opportunity
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
express
somewhat
emphatically
his
disapproval
of
the
conduct
of
Mr.
Bloundel
,
but
promise
to
set
all
to
right
without
loss
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
only
difficulty
I
foresee
,
"
he
observe
,
"
be
that
the
poor
youth
be
attack
by
the
pestilence
;
and
though
I
may
succeed
in
cure
him
,
his
master
will
probably
have
shut
up
his
house
before
I
can
accomplish
my
object
,
in
which
case
,
all
chance
of
his
union
with
Amabel
will
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
much
the
well
,
"
rejoin
Nizza
,
sharply
;
"
she
do
not
deserve
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
I
agree
with
you
,
"
return
hodge
.
<EOS>
"
but
could
you
point
out
any
one
who
do
?
"
<EOS>
he
add
,
with
a
slight
but
significant
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
no
answer
be
return
;
and
as
they
have
just
reach
the
portico
of
the
cathedral
,
they
enter
the
sacred
structure
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
ascend
the
winding
stair
,
loud
outcry
resound
along
the
ambulatory
,
and
echo
by
the
vaulted
roof
of
the
nave
,
convince
them
that
the
sufferer
be
again
in
a
state
of
frenzy
,
produce
by
fever
and
the
anguish
of
his
sore
;
and
on
reach
the
cell
they
find
him
struggle
violently
with
Solomon
Eagle
,
who
hold
him
down
by
main
force
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
in
a
fearfully
excited
state
,
truly
,
"
observe
Hodges
,
as
he
draw
near
,
"
and
must
not
be
leave
for
a
moment
,
or
he
will
do
himself
a
mischief
.
<EOS>
I
must
give
him
a
draught
to
allay
the
fever
,
and
compose
his
nerve
--
for
in
this
state
<EOS>
I
dare
not
have
recourse
to
the
lancet
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
with
this
he
dress
the
tumour
;
and
pour
the
content
of
a
large
phial
which
he
have
bring
with
him
in
a
cup
,
he
hold
it
to
the
burn
lip
of
the
apprentice
,
who
eagerly
quaff
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
soon
apparent
that
the
dose
produce
a
salutary
effect
,
and
a
second
be
administer
.
<EOS>
still
the
sufferer
,
though
calm
,
continue
to
ramble
as
before
--
complain
that
his
vein
be
fill
with
molten
lead
--
entreat
them
to
plunge
him
in
a
stream
,
so
that
he
may
cool
his
intolerable
thirst
,
and
appear
to
be
in
great
agony
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Hodges
watch
by
him
till
daybreak
,
at
which
time
he
sink
into
a
slumber
;
and
Solomon
Eagle
,
who
have
never
till
then
relinquish
his
hold
of
him
,
now
venture
to
resign
his
post
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
be
then
about
to
depart
;
but
at
the
urgent
solicitation
of
Nizza
,
who
have
station
herself
at
the
door
of
the
cell
,
he
agree
to
remain
a
little
long
.
 
<EOS>
two
hour
after
this
,
the
door
of
the
cathedral
be
open
,
and
a
large
crowd
soon
assemble
within
the
nave
,
as
on
the
precede
day
.
<EOS>
the
tumult
of
voice
reach
the
cell
and
awaken
the
sleeper
.
<EOS>
before
he
could
be
prevent
he
start
from
his
bed
,
and
dash
aside
the
feeble
opposition
offer
by
Nizza
and
the
doctor
,
run
along
the
ambulatory
,
utter
a
loud
and
fearful
cry
.
<EOS>
find
the
door
of
the
winding
staircase
open
,
he
dart
through
it
,
and
in
a
few
second
reappear
in
the
aisle
.
<EOS>
hear
the
cry
,
several
person
rush
to
meet
him
;
but
on
behold
his
haggard
look
and
strange
appearance
--
he
be
merely
wrap
in
a
blanket,--they
instantly
recoil
.
<EOS>
mean
-
time
,
Doctor
Hodges
,
who
have
run
to
one
of
the
arched
opening
look
on
the
nave
,
call
out
to
them
to
secure
the
fugitive
.
<EOS>
but
all
flee
at
his
approach
;
and
when
he
reach
the
door
of
the
southern
transept
,
the
verger
,
instead
of
attempt
to
stop
him
,
retreat
with
a
cry
of
alarm
.
<EOS>
as
he
pass
through
the
outlet
,
one
man
bold
than
the
rest
catch
hold
of
him
,
and
endeavour
to
detain
him
.
<EOS>
but
,
leave
the
blanket
in
his
hand
,
and
without
other
covering
than
his
shirt
,
the
apprentice
dash
across
the
churchyard
--
next
shape
his
course
down
Saint
Bennet's
-
hill
--
then
cross
<EOS>
Thames
-
street,--and
finally
speed
along
another
narrow
thoroughfare
,
reach
Paul
's
wharf
.
<EOS>
gaze
for
a
moment
at
the
current
sweeping
past
him
--
it
be
high
-
tide,--he
plunged
head
foremost
into
it
from
the
high
embankment
,
and
on
rise
to
the
surface
,
be
a
strong
and
expert
swimmer
,
strike
out
for
the
opposite
shore
.
<EOS>
those
who
beheld
him
be
fill
with
amazement
;
but
such
be
the
alarm
occasion
by
his
appearance
,
that
none
venture
to
interfere
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
cross
more
than
a
fourth
part
of
the
stream
when
Doctor
Hodges
arrive
at
the
wharf
;
but
neither
promise
of
reward
nor
threat
could
induce
any
of
the
waterman
to
follow
him
.
<EOS>
the
humane
physician
would
have
spring
into
a
boat
,
but
feel
he
should
be
wholly
unable
to
manage
it
,
he
most
reluctantly
abandon
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
scarcely
doubt
what
the
result
of
this
rash
attempt
would
be
,
and
yet
unable
to
tear
himself
away
,
he
linger
on
the
wharf
till
he
see
Leonard
reach
the
opposite
bank
,
where
an
attempt
be
make
by
a
party
of
person
to
seize
him
.
<EOS>
but
instead
of
quietly
surrender
himself
,
the
apprentice
instantly
leapt
into
the
river
again
,
and
begin
to
swim
back
towards
the
point
whence
he
have
start
.
<EOS>
amazed
at
what
he
see
,
the
doctor
order
his
servant
,
who
by
this
time
have
join
the
group
,
to
bring
a
blanket
,
and
descend
to
the
edge
of
the
river
,
await
the
swimmer
's
arrival
.
<EOS>
in
less
than
ten
minute
he
have
reach
the
shore
,
and
clamber
on
the
bank
,
fall
from
exhaustion
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
violent
effort
of
nature
,
which
have
accomplish
more
than
science
or
skill
could
do
,
"
say
Hodges
,
as
he
gaze
on
the
body
,
and
see
that
the
pestilential
tumour
have
wholly
disappeared--"he
be
completely
cure
of
the

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
throw
the

over
him

between

grocer
and
his

,
as
he
take
her
home
from
Saint

's
.
<EOS>
Amabel
,
in
fact
,
be
so
overpower
by
conflict
emotion
that
she
could
not
speak
;
while
her
father
,
who
could
not
help
reproach
himself
for
the
harshness
he
have
display
towards
Leonard
Holt
,
feel
no
disposition
to
break
silence
.
<EOS>
They
find
Mrs.
Bloundel
at
the
shop

door
,
drown
in
tear
,
and
almost
in
a
state
of
distraction

on
see
them
,
she
rush
towards
her
daughter
,
and
strain
her
to
her
bosom
,
give
free
vent
to
the
impulse
of
her
affection

<EOS>
allow
the
first
transport

Mr.

beg

her
to
retire
to
her

with

not
to
leave
it
till
they
have
both
regain
their
composure
,
when
he
wish
to
have
some
serious
conversation
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
His
request
comply
with
,
the
grocer
then
retrace
his
step
to
the
cathedral
with
the
intention
of
seek
an
explanation
from
Leonard
,
and
,
if
he
see
occasion
to
do
so
,
of
revoke
his
severe
mandate
.
<EOS>
but
long
before
he
reach
the
southern
transept
,
the
apprentice
have
disappear
,
nor
could
he
learn
what
have
become
of
him

<EOS>
while
anxiously
pursue
his
search
among
the
crowd
,
and
address
inquiry
to
all
whom
he
think
likely
to
afford
him
information

he
perceive

his

as

draw
near

he

the

Mr.

<EOS>
almost
all

Mr.

hide
his
emotion

endeavour
through
his
blinded
gaze
to
discover
Leonard
,
but
,
as
will

without

<EOS>
stun
by
the
cry
and
groan
that
pierce
his

the
pestilential
effluvia

rush
out

and
gladly

a
glass
of
sack
offer
him
by
his
conductor

dreadful
nausea

<EOS>
"
I

to
a
spacious
outbuilding

once
use
for
cattle

in
the
midst
of
which
stand
a
large
frame

six
body

cover
only
with
a
sheet
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
could
not
overcome
his
repugnance
to
enter
this
shed
;
but
the
chirurgeon
,
who
appear
habituate
to
such
scene
,
and
to
regard
them
lightly
,
throw
off
the
sheet
,
and
raise
the
corpse
,
one
by
one
,
that
he
may
the
well
view
them
.
<EOS>
one
peculiarity
Mr.
Bloundel
notice
;
<EOS>
namely
,
that
the
limb
of
these
unfortunate
victim
of
the
pestilence
do
not
stiffen
,
as
would
have
be
the
case
if
they
have
die
of
any
other
disorder
;
while
the
blotch
that
appear
on
the
livid
flesh
make
them
object
almost
too
horrible
to
look
upon
.
<EOS>
in
many
case
the
feature
be
frightfully
distorted
--
the
tongue
of
the
poor
wretch
swell
and
protrude
--
the
hand
clench
,
and
the
toe
bend
towards
the
sol
of
the
foot
.
<EOS>
everything
denote
the
dreadful
pang
that
must
have
attend
dissolution
.
 
<EOS>
greatly
relieved
to
find
that
the
whole
of
this
ghastly
group
be
stranger
to
him
,
Mr.
Bloundel
thank
the
chirurgeon
,
and
depart
.
<EOS>
convince
that
he
have
be
deceive
by
the
coffin
-
maker
,
he
now
begin
to
hope
that
the
whole
story
be
false
;
but
he
determine
not
to
rest
till
he
have
thoroughly
investigate
the
matter
.
<EOS>
before
do
so
,
however
,
he
think
it
advisable
to
return
home
,
and
accordingly
shape
his
course
toward
Cripplegate
,
and
,
pass
through
the
postern
,
stop
at
an
apothecary
's
shop
,
and
get
his
apparel
fumigate
and
sprinkle
with
spirit
of
hartshorn
and
sulphur
.
 
<EOS>
on
reach
wood
-
street
,
he
notice
,
with
some
uneasiness
,
a
number
of
person
gather
together
before
his
dwelling
.
<EOS>
His
fear
be
speedily
relieve
by
find
that
the
assemblage
be
collect
by
a
preacher
,
who
be
pronounce
an
exhortation
to
them
in
tone
almost
as
loud
and
emphatic
as
those
of
Solomon
Eagle
.
<EOS>
the
preacher
's
appearance
be
very
remarkable
,
and
attract
the
attention
of
the
grocer
,
who
join
the
crowd
to
listen
to
him
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
could
be
judge
,
he
be
a
middle
-
aged
man
,
with
black
hair
float
over
his
shoulder
,
earnest
feature
,
and
a
grey
eye
of
extraordinary
brilliancy
.
<EOS>
His
figure
be
slight
and
erect
,
and
his
gesture
as
impassioned
as
his
look
.
<EOS>
He
speak
with
great
rapidity
;
and
his
eloquence
,
combine
with
his
fervent
manner
and
expression
,
completely
entrance
his
audience
.
<EOS>
He
be
habit
in
a
cassock
and
band
,
and
have
take
off
his
cap
,
which
be
hold
by
an
attendant
,
who
stand
near
the
stool
on
which
he
be
mount
.
<EOS>
the
latter
differ
materially
from
his
master
.
<EOS>
His
closely
-
crop
hair
,
demure
look
,
sugar
-
loaf
hat
,
and
suit
of
rusty
sable
,
seem
to
proclaim
him
a
Puritan
;
but
his
twinkle
eye
--
for
he
have
but
one
,
and
wear
a
black
patch
over
the
orifice
--
his
inflame
cheek
,
and
mulberry
nose
contradict
the
idea
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
preacher
distinguish
Mr.
Bloundel
,
he
address
his
discourse
to
him
;
and
,
allude
to
his
religious
habit
and
general
excellence
of
character

him
up
as
an
example
to
other

sudden
interruption

amid
the
crowd
,
the
attendant
attempt
to
check
it
,
and
in
do
so
receive
a
sound
buffet
on
the
ear
.
<EOS>
in
endeavour
to
return
the
blow
,
he
strike
another
party
,
who
instantly
retaliate
,
and
a
general
affray
commence
--
<EOS>
some
take
one
side
,
some
the
other
.
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
the
confusion
three
person
force
their
way
towards
the
preacher
,
knock
him
from
his
stool
,
and
,
assail
him
with
the
most
opprobrious
epithet
,
deal
him
several
seemingly
severe
blow
,
and
would
have
further
maltreat
him
,
if
Mr.
Bloundel
have
not
interpose
,
and
,
push
aside
his
assailant
,
give
him
his
hand
,
and
lead
him
into
his
dwelling

shortly
afterwards

crowd
dispersing

companion

the
shop
in
search
of
his
master

"
I

I

he
add
to
Mr.

<EOS>
"
You
have
act
nobly

observe
the
doctor
,
at
the
close
of
his
recital
;

if
Amabel
have
a
spark
of
generosity
in

composition

she
would
worthily
requite
you

I
do
not

<EOS>
how
different

her
conduct

would
advise

to
turn
your
thought
to
her

She
will
make
you
happy
:

the
indulgence

for
hopeless
it
be

only
lead
to
wretchedness

Leonard

I

<EOS>
Amabel
do
not
love
the
Earl

blindly

more
constantly

forward
your

efficiently

I
see
no

everything

it

the

it

observe
Pillichody

I

it

opinion
both
of
Mr.

while
thus
engage

he
contrive
ever

anon
to
steal
a
glance
at
Amabel

on
these
occasion

his
eye
be
quite
as
eloquent

among
other
topic
interesting

the
persecution

which
his

forward
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
could
not
reprobate
the
earl
's
conduct
more
strongly
than
his
guest
do
;

he
assail
himself
with
such
virulence
that
,
in
spite
of
her
uneasiness
,
Amabel
could
not
repress
a
smile
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
so
accommodate
himself
to
the
grocer
's
opinion
,
and
so
win
upon
his
regard
,
that
the
latter
offer
him
an
asylum

continuance
of
the

agitated

Mrs.

forbidding
expression

at
the

an
equally
striking
change,--each

could
scarcely
believe

<EOS>
the
first
few
day
of
their
confinement
be

by
the
grocer
's
family
in
a
very
uncomfortable
manner
.
<EOS>
no
one
,
except
Mr.
Bloundel
,
appear
reconcile
to
the
plan
,
and
even
he
find
it
more
difficult
of
accomplishment
that
he
have
anticipate
.
<EOS>
the
darkness
of
the
room
,
and
the
want
of
ventilation
cause
by
the
closed
window
and
bar
door
,
give
the
house
the
air
of
a
prison
,
and
occasion
a
sense
of
oppression
almost
intolerable
.
<EOS>
Blaize
declare
it
be
"
bad
than
be
in
Newgate
,
and
that
he
must
take
an
additional
rufu
to
set
right
his
digestion
;
"
while
Patience
affirm
"
that
it
be
like
be
bury
alive
,
and
that
she
would
not
stand
it
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
pay
no
attention
to
their
complaint
,
but
address
himself
seriously
to
the
remedy
.
<EOS>
insist
upon
the
utmost
attention
be
pay
to
cleanliness
,
he
have
an
abundant
supply
of
water
draw
,
with
which
the
floor
of
every
room
and
passage
be
wash
down
daily
.
<EOS>
by
such

the
house
be
keep

and
wholesome
;
and
its
inmate
,
become
habituate
to
the
gloom
,
in
a
great
degree
recover
their
cheerfulness
.
 
<EOS>
the
daily
routine
of
the
establishment
be
as
follow
.
<EOS>
the
grocer
arise
at
dawn
,
and
proceed
to
call
up
the
whole
of
his
family
.
<EOS>
They
then
assemble
in
a
large
room
on
the
second
story
,
where
he
offer
up
thank
that
they
have
be
spare
during
the
night
,
and
pray
for
their
preservation
during
the
day
.
<EOS>
He
next
assign
a
task
to
each
,
and
take
care
to
see
it
afterwards
duly
fulfil
;
<EOS>
well
know
that
constant
employment
be
the
good
way
to
check
repine
and
promote
contentment
.
<EOS>
heretofore
the
servant
have
always
take
their
meal
in
the
kitchen
,
but
now
they
always
sit
down
to
table
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
make
no
distinction
at
this
season
,
"
he
say
;
"
all
shall
fare
as
I
fare
,
and
enjoy
the
same
comfort
as
myself
.
<EOS>
and
I
trust
that
my
dwelling
may
be
as
sure
a
refuge
amid
this
pestilential
storm
as
the
ark
of
the
patriarch
prove
when
Heaven
's
vengeance
be
call
forth
in
the
mighty
flood

"
 
<EOS>
Their
devotion
end
,
the
whole
party
repair
to
one
of
the
low
room
,
where
a
plentiful
breakfast
be
provide
,
and
of
which
they
all
partook
.
<EOS>
the
business
of
the
day
then
begin
,
and
,
as
have
just
be
observe
,
no
one
be
suffer
to
remain
idle
.
<EOS>
the
young
child
be
allow
to
play
and
exercise
themselves
as
much
as
they
choose
in
the
garret
,
and
Blaize
and
Patience
be
occasionally
invite
to
join
them
.
<EOS>
a
certain
portion
of
the
evening
be
also
devote
to
harmless
recreation
and
amusement
.
<EOS>
the
result
may
be
anticipate

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
prayer
,
as
usual
,
conclude
the
day
,
and
the
family
retire
to
rest
at
an
early
hour
.
 
<EOS>
this
system
of
thing
may
appear
sufficiently
monotonous
,
but
it
be
precisely
adapt
to
the
exigency
of
the
case
,
and
produce
a
most
salutary
effect
.
<EOS>
regular
duty
and
regular
employment
be
impose
upon
each
,
and
their
constant
recurrence
,
so
far
from
be
irksome
,
soon
become
agreeable
.
<EOS>
after
a
while
the
whole
family
seem
to
grow
indifferent
to
the
external
world
--
to
live
only
for
each
other
,
and
to
think
only
of
each
other
--
and
to
Leonard
Holt
,
indeed
,
that
house
be
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
those
wall
contain
everything
dear
to
him
,
and
he
would
have
be
quite
content
never
to
leave
them
if
Amabel
have
be
always
near
.
<EOS>
He
make
no
attempt
to
renew
his
suit
--
seldom
or
never
exchange
a
word
with
her
,
and
may
have
be
suppose
to
have
become
wholly
indifferent
to
her
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
so
.
<EOS>
His
heart
be
consume
by
the
same
flame
as
before
.
<EOS>
no
longer
,
however
,
a
prey
to
jealousy
--
no
longer
apprehensive
of
the
earl
<EOS>
--
he
feel
so
happy
,
in
comparison
with
what
he
have
be
,
that
he
almost
pray
that
the
term
of
their
imprisonment
may
be
prolong
.
<EOS>
sometimes
the
image
of
Nizza
Macascree
would
intrude
upon
him
,
and
he
think
,
with
a
feeling
akin
to
remorse
,
of
what
she
may
suffer
--
for
he
be
too
well
acquaint
with
the
pang
of
unrequited
love
not
to
sympathise
deeply
with
her
.
<EOS>
as
to
Amabel
,
she
address
herself
assiduously
to
the
task
enjoin
by
her
father
,
and
allow
her
mind
to
dwell
as
little
as
possible
on
the
past
,
but
employ
all
her
spare
time
in
devotional
exercise
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
remember
that
the
grocer
have
reserve
a
communication
with
the
street
,
by
mean
of
a
shutter
opening
from
a
small
room
in
the
upper
story
.
<EOS>
hither
he
would
now
frequently
repair
,
and
though
he
do
not
as
yet
think
it
necessary
to
have
recourse
to
all
the
precautionary
measure
he
intend
eventually
to
adopt
--
such
as
flash
a
pistol
when
he
look
forth
--
yet
he
never
open
the
shutter
without
hold
a
phial
of
vinegar
,
or
a
handkerchief
wet
with
the
same
liquid
,
to
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
before
close
his
house
he
have
hire
a
porter
,
who
occupy
the
hutch
at
his
door
,
and
hold
himself
in
readiness
to
execute
any
commission
,
or
perform
any
service
that

doleful
bell
announce
the
approach

prognosticate

viz

that
with
the
heat
of
summer
the
plague
would
fearfully

<EOS>
by

and
the
care
which
he
take
to

<EOS>
the
middle
of
June
have
arrive

and
such
dismal
account
be
now
bring
him

havoc
occasion

that
he
would
no

take

fresh
provision

but
begin
to
open
his
store
.
<EOS>
Dallison
tell
him
that
the
alarm
be
bad
than
ever
--
that
vast
number
be
endeavour
to
leave
the
city
,
but
no
one
could
now
do
so
without
a
certificate
,
which
be
never
grant
if

slight
suspicion
be
attach
to

<EOS>
"
if

"
London

have
leave
their

<EOS>
many

<EOS>
all

and
the
tavern
be
only
open

the
profane
and
dissolute

who
deride
God

judgment

and
declare
they
have

<EOS>
robbery

murder

and
other
crime

have
greatly
increase

and
the
most
dreadful
deed
be
now
commit

<EOS>
You
have
do
wisely

sir

in
protect
yourself

<EOS>
"

"
I
have
reason
to
be
thankful
that
I
have
do
so

"
reply
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
and
he
close
his
shutter
to
meditate
on
what
he
have
just
hear
.
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
abundant
food
for
reflection
.
<EOS>
around
him
lie
a
great
and
populous
city
,
hem
in
,
as
by
a
fire
,
by
an
exterminate
plague
,
that
spare
neither
age
,
condition
,
nor
sex
.
<EOS>
no
man
could
tell
what
the
end
of
all
this
would
be
--
neither
at
what
point
the
wrath
of
the
offend
Deity
would
stop
--
nor
whether
He
would
relent
,
till
He
have
utterly
destroy
a
people
who
so
contemn
his
word
.
<EOS>
scarcely
daring
to
hope
for
leniency
,
and
fill
with
a
dreadful
foreboding
of
what
would
ensue
,
the
grocer
address
a
long
and
fervent
supplication
to
Heaven
,
implore
a
mitigation
of
its
wrath
.
 
<EOS>
on
join
his
family
,
his
grave
manner
and
silence

how
powerfully

have
be
affect

<EOS>
no

question
him
as
to
what
have
occur
,
but
all
understand
he
have
receive
some
distress
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
amid
his
anxiety
one
circumstance
give
him
unalloyed
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
change
work
in
Amabel
's
character
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
state
that
she
have
become
extremely
devout
,
and
pass
the
whole
of
the
time
not
appoint
for
other
occupation
,
in
the
study
of
the
scripture
,
or
in
prayer
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
be
extremely
sedate
,
and
her
conversation
assume
a
tone
that
give
her
parent
,
and
especially
her
father
,
inexpressible
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bloundel
would
have
be
equally
delight
with
the
change
,
if
it
have
tend
to
forward
her
own
favourite
scheme
of
a
union
with
Leonard

as

she
rejoice
in

improvement

she

satisfied

Mr.

who
be
still
not
without
apprehension

"
 
<EOS>
this
intelligence
greatly
alarm
the
grocer
,
and
he
begin
to
fear
his
plan
would
be
defeat
in
an
unexpected
manner
.
<EOS>
He
engage
Dallison
to
procure
another
trusty
companion
to
take
his
place
at
night
,
and
furnish
him
with
money
to
purchase
arm
.
<EOS>
He
no
longer
sleep
as
tranquilly
as
before
,
but
frequently
repair
to
his
place
of
observation
to
see
that
the
watchman
be
at
his
post
,
and
that
all
be
secure
.
<EOS>
for
the
last
few
day
,
he
have
remark
with
some
uneasiness
that
a
youth
frequently
pass
the
house
and
gaze
at
the
bar
window
,
and
he
at
first
imagine
he
may
be
league
with
the
nocturnal
marauder
he
have
hear
of
;
but
the
prepossess
appearance
of
the
stripling
,
who
could
not
be
more
than
sixteen
,
and
who
be
singularly
slightly
make
,
soon
dispel
the
idea
.
<EOS>
still
,
as
he
constantly
appear
at
the
same
spot
,
the
grocer
begin
to
have
a
new
apprehension
,
and
to
suspect
he
be
an
emissary
of
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
and
he
send
Dallison
to
inquire
his
business
.
<EOS>
the
youth
return
an
evasive
answer
,
and
withdraw
;
but
the
next
day
he
be
there
again
.
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
,
Mr.
Bloundel
point
him
out
to
Leonard
Holt
,
and
ask
him
if
he
have
see
him
before
.
<EOS>
the
youth
's
back
be
towards
them
,
the
apprentice
unhesitatingly
answer
in
the
negative
,
but
as
the
subject
of
investigation
turn
the
next
moment
,
and
look
up
,
reveal
feature
of
feminine
delicacy
and
beauty
,
set
off
by
long
flow
jet
-
black
ringlet
,
Leonard
start
,
and
colour
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
mistaken
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
_
have
_
see
him
before
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
he
one
of
the
Earl
of
Rochester

page
?
"
ask
Mr.
Bloundel
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
reply
Leonard
,
"
and
you
need
not
be
uneasy
about
him
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
he
intend
no
harm
.
"
 
<EOS>
thus
satisfied
,
the
grocer
think
no
more
about
the
matter
.
<EOS>
He
then
arrange
with
Leonard
that
he
should
visit
the
window
at
certain
hour
on
alternate
night
with
himself
,
and
appoint
the
following
night
as
that
on
which
the
apprentice
's
duty
should
commence
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
same
night
,
however
,
an
alarming
incident
occur
,
which
keep
the
grocer
and
his
apprentice
for
a
long
time
on
the
watch
.
<EOS>
the
family
have
just
retire
to
rest
when
the
report
of
fire
-
arm
be
hear
close
to
the
street
door
,
and
Mr.
Bloundel
hastily
call
up
Leonard
,
they
repair
to
the
room
overlook
the
street
,
and
find
that
a
desperate
struggle
be
go
on
below
.
<EOS>
the
moon
be
overcloud
,
and
the
lantern
extinguish
,
it
be
too
dark
to
discern
the
figure
of
the
combatant
,
and
in
a
few
second
all
become
silent
,
except
the
groan
of
a
wounded
man
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
then
call
out
to
know
what
be
the
matter
,
and
ascertain
from
the
sufferer
,
who
prove
to
be
his
own
watchman
,
that
the
adjoin
house
,
be
infect
,
have
be
shut
up
by
the
authority
;
and
its
owner
,
unable
to
bear
the
restraint
,
have
burst
open
the
door
,
shoot
the
watchman
station
at
it
,
and
fire
another
pistol
at
the
poor
wretch
who
be
make
the
statement
,
because
he
endeavour
to
oppose
his
flight
,
have
subsequently
attack
him
with
his
sword
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
grief
to
Mr.
Bloundel
not
to
be
able
to
aid
the
unfortunate
watchman
,
and
he
have
almost
determine
to
hazard
a
descent
by
the
pulley
,
when
a
musical
voice
be
hear
below
,
and
the
grocer
soon
understand
that
the
youth
,
about
whom
his
curiosity
have
be
excite
,
be
raise
the
sufferer
,
and
endeavour
to
stanch
his
wound
.
<EOS>
find
this
impossible
,
however
,
at
Mr.
Bloundel
's
request
,
he
go
in
search
of
assistance
,
and
presently
afterwards
return
with
a
posse
of
man
,
bear
halberd
and
lantern
,
who
carry
off
the
wounded
man
,
and
afterwards
start
in
pursuit
of
the
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
then
enter
into
conversation
with
the
youth
,
who
inform
him
that
his
name
be
Flitcroft
,
that
he
be
without
a
home
,
all
his
relation
have
die
of
the
plague
,
and
that
he
be
anxious
to
serve
as
a
watchman
in
place
of
the
poor
wretch
who
have
just
be
remove
.
<EOS>
Leonard
remonstrate
against
this
arrangement
,
but
Mr.
Bloundel
be
so
much
pleased
with
Flitcroft
's
conduct
that
he
would
listen
to
no
objection
.
<EOS>
accordingly

lower
down
in
a
basket
to
the
poor
youth
,
and
he
station
himself
in
the
hutch
.
<EOS>

during
the
day
.
<EOS>
Flitcroft
resign

to

but
return
in
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
at
midnight
,
Leonard
take
his
turn
to
watch
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
bright
moonlight
night
,
but
though
he
occasionally
look
out
into
the
street
,
and
perceive
Flitcroft
below
,
he
give
no
intimation
of
his
presence
.
<EOS>
all
at
once
,
however
,
he
be

by
a
loud
cry
,
and
open
the
shutter
,
perceive
the
youth
struggle
with
two
person
,
whom
he
recognise
as
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
and
Pillichody
.
 
<EOS>
He
shout
to
them
to
release
their
captive
,
but
they
laugh
at
his
vociferation
,
and
in
spite
of
his
resistance
drag
the
youth
away
.
<EOS>
madden
at
the
sight
,
Leonard
lower
the
rope
as
quickly
as
he
could
with
the
intention
of
descend
by
it
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
,
Flitcroft
turn
an
agonized
look
behind
him
,
and
perceive
what

break
suddenly
from
his
captor

and
before
he
could

and
lay
hold
of
the
rope

<EOS>
Leonard

and
divine

with
the
quickness
of

in
time

his
vociferation

and
find
pursuit
unavaile

he
come
to
a
halt
.
<EOS>
He
then
more
slowly
retrace
his
step
,
and
on
arrive
at
the
grocer
's
residence
,
find
the
basket
draw
up
.
<EOS>
almost
afraid
to
call
out
,
he
at
length
muster
courage
enough
to
shout
to
Blaize
to
lower
it
,
and
be
answer
by
Mr.
Bloundel
,
who
,
put
his
head
through
the
window
,
demand
in
a
stern
tone
why
he
have
leave
the
house
?
 
<EOS>
Leonard
briefly
explain
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
deeply
regret
your
imprudence
,
"
reply
his
master
;
"
because
I
can
now
no
more
admit
you
.
<EOS>
It
be
my
fix
determination
,
as
you
well
know
,
not
to
suffer
any
member
of
my
family
who
may
quit
my
house
,
to
enter
it
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
attempt
to
remonstrate
with
you
,
sir
,
"
reply
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
all
I
pray
of
you
be
to
allow
me
to
occupy
this
hutch
,
and
to
act
as
your
porter
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
willingly
,
"
rejoin
Mr.
Bloundel
;
"
and
as
you
have
have
the
plague
,
you
will
run
no
risk
of
infection
.
<EOS>
You
shall
know
all
that
pass
within
door
;
and
I
only
lament
that
you
should
have
banish
yourself
from
the
asylum
which
I
hope
to
afford
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
after
some
further
conversation
between
them
,
a
bundle
be
lower
by
the
grocer
,
contain
a
change
of
clothe
and
a
couple
of
blanket
.
<EOS>
on
receive
these
,
Leonard
retire
to
the
hutch
,
and
tie
a
handkerchief
round
his
wounded
arm
,
wrap
himself
in
a
night
trail
,
and
stretch
himself
on
the
ground
,
in
spite
of
his
anxiety
,
soon
sink
asleep
.
<EOS>
He
awake
about
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
with
a
painful
consciousness
of
what
have
take
place
during
the
night
.
<EOS>
It
be
just
begin
to
grow
light
,
and
he
walk
across
the
street
to
gaze
at
the
house
from
which
he
be
exile
.
<EOS>
Its
melancholy
,
uninhabited
look
do
not
serve
to
cheer
him
.
<EOS>
It
seem
totally
altered
since
he
know
it
first
.
<EOS>
the
sign
,
which
then
invite
the
passer
-
by
to
enter
the
shop
and
deal
with
its
honest
owner
,
now
appear
no
longer
significant
,
unless
--
and
it
will
be
remember
it
be
the
Noah
's
Ark
<EOS>
--
it
could
be
suppose
to
have
reference
to
those
shut
up
within
.
<EOS>
the
apprentice
look
at
the
habitation
with
misgiving
,
and
,
instead
of
regard
it
as
a
sanctuary
from
the
pestilence
,
could
not
help
picture
it
as
a
live
tomb
.
<EOS>
the
last
conversation
he
have
have
with
Amabel
also
arise
forcibly
to
his
recollection
,
and
the
little
likelihood
there
appear
of
see
her
again
give
him
acute
agony
.
<EOS>
oppress
by
this
painful
idea
,
and
unable
to
exclude
from
his
thought
the
unhappy
situation
of
Nizza
Macascree
,
he
bend
his
step
,
scarcely
know
whither
he
be
go
,
towards
Saint
Paul
's
.
 
<EOS>
have
pass
so
much
of
his
time
of
late
in
the
cathedral
,
Leonard
begin
to
regard
it
as
a
sort
of
home
,
and
it
now
appear
like
a
place
of
refuge
to
him
.
<EOS>
proceed
to
the
great
western
entrance
,
he
seat
himself
on
one
of
the
large
block
of
stone
leave
there
by
the
mason
occupy
in
repair
the
exterior
of
the
fane
.
<EOS>
His
eye
rest
upon
the
mighty
edifice
before
him
,
and
the
clear
sparkling
light
reveal
numberless
point
of
architectural
grandeur
and
beauty
which
he
have
never
before
notice
.
<EOS>
the
enormous
buttress
and
lofty
pinnacle
of
the
central
tower
be
tinge
with
the
beam
of
the
rise
sun
,
and
glow
as
if
build
of
porphyry
.
<EOS>
while
gaze
at
the
summit
of
this
tower
,
and
call
to
mind
the
magnificent
view
he
have
recently
witness
from
it
at
the
same
hour
,
if
a
wish
could
have
transport
him
thither
at
that
moment
,
he
would
have
enjoy
it
again
.
<EOS>
but
as
this
could
not
be
,
he
try
to
summon
before
his
mental
vision
the
whole
glorious
prospect
--
the
broad
and
shine
river
,
with
its
moving
or
motionless
craft
--
the
gardens
,
the
noble
mansion
,
the
warehouse
,
and
mighty
wharf
on
its
bank
--
London
Bridge
,
with
its
enormous
pile
of
habitation
--
the
old
and
picturesque
city
,
with
its
innumerable
tower
,
and
spire
,
and
girdle
of
grey
wall
--
the
green
field
and
wind
lane
lead
to
the
lovely
hill
around
it
<EOS>
--
all
these
object
arise
obedient
to
his
fancy
,
and
come
array
in
colour
as
fresh
as
that
wherein
they
have
before
appear
to
him
.
<EOS>
while
thus
occupy
,
his
gaze
remain
rivet
on
the
summit
of
the
central
tower
,
and
he
fancy
he
perceive
some
one
lean
over
the
balustrade
;
but
as
little
beyond
the
upper
part
of
the
figure
could
be
discern
,
and
as
it
appear
perfectly
motionless
,
he
could
not
be
quite
sure
that
his
eye
do
not
deceive
him
.
<EOS>
have
gaze
at
the
object
for
some
minute
,
during
which
it
maintain
the
same
attitude
,
he
continue
his
survey
of
the
pile
,
and
become
so
excited
by
the
sublime
emotion
inspire
by
the
contemplation
,
as
to
be
insensible
to
aught
else
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
while
he
arise
,
and
be
about
to
proceed
towards
the
portico
,
when
,
chance
to
look
at
the
top
of
the
tower
,
he
remark
that
the
figure
have
disappear
,
and
while
wonder
who
it
could
be
,
he
perceive
a
person
emerge
from
one
of
the
tall
window
in
the
low
part
of
the
tower
.
<EOS>
It
be
Solomon
Eagle
,
and
he
no
longer
wonder
at
what
he
have
see
.
<EOS>
the
enthusiast
be
without
his
brazier
,
but
carry
a
long
stout
staff
.
<EOS>
He
run
along
the
pointed
roof
of
the
nave
with
inconceivable
swiftness
,
till
,
reach
the
vast
stone
cross
,
upwards
of
twelve
foot
in
height
,
ornament
the
western
extremity
,
he
climb
its
base
,
and
clasp
the
transverse
bar
of
the
sacred
symbol
of
his
faith
with
his
left
arm
,
extend
his
staff
with
his
right
,
and
describe
a
circle
,
as
if
point
out
the
wall
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
He
then
raise
his
staff
towards
heaven
to
invoke
its
vengeance
,
and
anon
point
it
menacingly
downwards
.
<EOS>
after
this
he
break
into
loud
denunciation
;
but
though
the
apprentice
could
not
hear
the
word
,
he
gather
their
purport
from
his
gesture
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
a
few
mason
have
assemble
,
and
produce
their
implement
,
commence
work
at
the
block
of
stone
.
<EOS>
glance
at
the
enthusiast
,
one
of
them
observe
with
a
smile
to
his
companion
,
"
there
be
Solomon
Eagle
pronounce
his
morning
curse
upon
the
city
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
the
judgment
he
utter
against
it
will
come
to
pass
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
assuredly
,
Phil
Gatford
,
"
reply
the
other
mason
,
gravely
;
"
and
I
look
upon
all
the
work
we
be
now
do
as
labour
throw
away
.
<EOS>
be
he
not
right
about
the
plague
?
<EOS>
do
he
not
foretell
the
devour
scourge
by
which
we
be
visit
?
<EOS>
and
he
will
be
right
also
about
the
fire
.
<EOS>
since
he
have
doom
it
,
this
cathedral
will
be
consume
by
flame
,
and
one
stone
will
not
be
leave
stand
on
another
.

It
be

<EOS>
by

the

on

Your
fearful

my

My

My
wish
be
to
save
your
soul

the
soul

all
who
listen

<EOS>
I
wonder
not
that
your

if
your

indignation

My
mission
be
not

to
warn

why

ye
thus
continue
impenitent

be
speak

not

by

by

ye
shall
be

now

mark
me
what
you
must
do

free
the
city
from
contagion

<EOS>
You
must
utterly

for
ever
abandon
your
evil
course

<EOS>
You
must
pray
incessantly
for
remission
of
your
sin

<EOS>
You
must
resign
yourself
without

to
such
chastisement

put

snatch
up
his

continue
his

lightning
speed

the
unfortunate
father

take
into

remove
to
Newgate

where
he
perish

in
less
than
a

of
the
distemper

<EOS>
the
aspect

follow
day
be
deplorable
enough

not
that

unfavourable

by

strike
a

it

not

that

timorous
venture
forth

all

<EOS>
the
result
,
too
,
of
the
experiment
be
singularly
unfortunate
.
<EOS>
whether
it
be
from
the
extraordinary
heat
occasion
by
the
lighting
of
so
many
fire
,
or
that
the
smoke
do
not
ascend

keep
down
the
pestilential
effluvia

that
the
number

meet
together
spread

certain
it

that

pestilence
be
more
widely
extend

fearfully
increase

here
he
find
Dallison
the
watchman

they
listen
in
awe

strike
silence
to
the
heavy
shower

to
the
hissing
of
the
blaze
ember
in

struggle
against
the
hostile
element

by

and
-
by
the
latter
sound
cease

<EOS>
not
a
light
could
be
see
throughout
the
whole
length
of
the
street

nor
be
there
any
red
reflection
of
the
innumerable
fire
as
heretofore
in

It
be
evident
all
be
extinguish
;

the
pitiless
pelting
of
the
rain

the
roar
of
the
water

spout

the
rush

over

fill
kennel

convert

this

a
sad

striking

I
hope
will
not

lose
upon
those
who
have
witness
it

<EOS>
It
show
the
utter
impotency
of
a
struggle
against
the
Divine
will
,

that
when
a
man
rely
upon
himself
for
preservation

he
depend
upon

if

unavaile

I
be
now
about

call
up
my

prayer

You

fall
upon
his
knee
,
and
as
soon
as
he
suppose
the
family
be
gather
together
,
commence
his
own
prayer
.
<EOS>
He
picture
the
whole
group
assemble
--
the
fervour
of
the
grocer
excite
to
an
unwonted
pitch
by
what
have
just
occur
--
the
earnest
countenance
of
his
wife
and
the
young
child
--
and
the
exalted
look
of
Amabel
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
see
her
--
neither
could
he
hear
her
voice
--
but
he
fancy
how
she
look
,
and
in
what
term
she
pray
--
and
it
be
no
slight
satisfaction
to
him
to
think
that
his
own
voice
ascend
to
Heaven
couple
with
hers

<EOS>
on
quit
the
hutch

he

physician
express
great
surprise
at
see
him

inquire
how
he
come
to
have
leave
his
master

house

<EOS>
Leonard
relate
all
that
have
happen
,

besought
his
assistance
in
Nizza

<EOS>
"
I
will
do
all
I
can
for
her

for
I
feel
greatly
interested
about
her

who
be
this
Sir

I
never
hear

"
I
know
nothing

what
I
have
tell
you

Leonard

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
a
friend
of
the
Earl

"
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
a
feign
name

I
will
speedily
find
him
out

<EOS>
You
must
lodge
at
my
house
tonight
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
well
for
you
than
sleep
in
that
damp
shed
.
<EOS>
but
,
first
,
I
must
have
a
word
or
two
with
your
master
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
abroad
all
night
,
and
come
hither
to
ascertain
what
he
think
of
this
plan
of
the
fire
,
and
what
he
have
do
.
<EOS>
how
do
you
give
the
signal
to
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
cord
within
the
hutch
by
which
you
can
sound
a
bell
within
his
chamber

return
Leonard
;
"
I
will
ring
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
he
do
so
,
and
the
summon
be
almost
instantly
answer
by
the
grocer
.
<EOS>
a
kindly
greeting
pass
between
the
latter
and
hodge
,
who
inquire
whether
all
be
go
on
satisfactorily
within
,
and
whether
anything
could
be
do
for
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
have
disturb
you
at
this
unseasonable
hour
,
"
he
say
,
"
but
chance
to
be
in
your
neighbourhood
,
and
think
it
likely
you
would
be
on
the
watch
,
I
call
to
have
a
word
with
you
.
<EOS>
though
I
could
not
foresee
what
would
happen
,
I
entirely
disapprove
of
these
fire
as
likely
to
increase
rather
than
check
the
pestilence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
hand
of
Heaven
have
extinguish
them
because
they
be
light
in
opposition
to
its
decree

"
reply
Bloundel
;
"
but
you
have
ask
me
whether
all
be
go
on
well
within
.
<EOS>
I
should
answer
readily
in
the
affirmative
,
but
that
my
wife
express
much
anxiety
respect
Amabel
.
<EOS>
We
have
no
longer
any
apprehension
of
misconduct
.
<EOS>
She
be
all
we
could
desire
--
serious
and
devout
.
<EOS>
but
we
have
fear
for
her
health
.
<EOS>
the
confinement
may
be
too
much
for
her
.
<EOS>
what
would
you
recommend
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
see
her
to
be
able
to
speak
confidently

reply
hodge
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
how
that
can
be
accomplish
,
unless
you
choose
to
ascend
by
a
basket
attach
to
the
pulley
,
"
reply
the
grocer
,
with
some
hesitation
,
"
and
it
be
against
my
plan
to
admit
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
your
daughter
's
life
,
my
good
friend
,
"
rejoin
hodge
;
"
think
of
that
.
<EOS>
if
I
choose
to
risk
life
and
limb
to
visit
her
,
you
may
surely
risk
the
chance
of
contagion
to
admit
me
.
<EOS>
but
you
need
have
no
fear
.
<EOS>
sprinkle
your
room
with
spirit
of
sulphur
,
and
place
a
phial
of
vinegar
so
that
I
can
use
it
on
my
first
entrance
into
the
house
,
and
I
will
answer
for
the
safety
of
your
family

<EOS>
these
preparation
make
,
Mr.
Bloundel
lower
the
basket
,
into
which
Hodges
get
,
and
grasp
the
rope
,
not
without
some
misgiving
on
his
part
,
he
be
draw
up
.
<EOS>
Leonard
witness
his
ascent
with
a
beat
heart
,
and
could
scarcely
repress
a
feeling
of
envy
when
he
see
him
pass
through
the
window
,
and
know
that
he
would
soon
be
in
the
presence
of
Amabel
.
<EOS>
but
this
feeling
quickly
change
into
one
of
deep
anxiety
concern
her
.
<EOS>
Her
father
's
account
of
her
have
increase
the
uneasiness
he
previously
feel
,
and
he
be
as
anxious
to
know
the
doctor
's
opinion
of
her
,
as
if
his
own
fate
have
depend
upon
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
keep
in
this
painful
state
of
suspense
for
nearly
an
hour
,
when
voice
be
hear
at
the
window
,
and
presently
afterwards
Hodges
be
carefully
let
down
.
<EOS>
bid
the
grocer
farewell
,
he
desire
Leonard
to
follow
him
,
and
lead
the
way
towards
Cheapside
.
<EOS>
They
proceed
a
short
distance
in
silence
,
when
the
latter
venture
to
remark
,
"
You
say
nothing
about
Amabel
,
sir
?
<EOS>
I
fear
you
find
her
seriously
indispose
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
do
not
question
me
about
her
just
now
,
"
rejoin
the
doctor
,
in
a
subdued
emotion
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
not
discuss
the
subject
.
"
 
<EOS>
nothing
more
be
say
;
for
though
the
apprentice
would
willingly
have
continue
the
conversation
,
his
companion
's
evident
disinclination
to
pursue
it
compel
him
to
desist
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
,
they
reach
the
doctor
's
residence
,
where
Leonard
be
immediately
show
to
a
comfortable
bed
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
late
when
he
awake
next
day
,
and
as
the
doctor
be
go
forth
,
he
partake
of
a
plentiful
breakfast
which
be
place
before
him
,
and
repair
to
wood
-
street
,
but
his
master
have
no
commission
for
him
to
execute
,
he
go
back
again
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
Doctor
Hodges
have
return
,
and
call
him
into
his
library
tell
him
he
wish
to
speak
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
right
last
night
,
"
he
say
,
"
in
construe
my
silence
into
alarm
for
Amabel
.
<EOS>
in
truth
,
I
fear
she
be
rapidly
sink
into
a
decline
,
and
nothing
will
arrest
the
progress
of
the
insidious
disease
but
instant
removal
to
the
country
.
<EOS>
to
this
she
will
not
consent
,
neither
do
I
know
how
it
could
be
accomplish
.
<EOS>
It
be
pitiable
to
see
so
lovely
a
creature
die
,
as
I
fear
she
be
,
of
a
broken
heart
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
cover
his
face
with
his
hand
,
and
weep
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
not
yet
speak
of
Nizza
Macascree
,
"
say
Hodges
,
after
a
pause
,
tap
him
kindly
on
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
have
discover
a
trace
of
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
reply
Leonard
,
rouse
himself
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
another
victim
of
these
profligate
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
be
revenge
upon
them
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
before
enjoin
you
to
restrain
your
indignation
,
just
though
it
be
,
"
return
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
yet
find
out
whither
she
have
be
take
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
a
clue
which
,
unless
I
be
mistaken
,
will
lead
me
to
it
.
<EOS>
but
I
must
now
dismiss
you
,
I
have
other
affair
to
attend
to
,
and
must
give
a
dangerous
and
difficult
case
,
on
which
I
have
be
consult
,
undisturbed
consideration
.
<EOS>
make
my
house
your
home
as
long
as
you
think
proper
.
"
 
<EOS>
warmly
thank
the
doctor
,
Leonard
then
withdraw
.
<EOS>
shortly
after
this
,
he
walk
forth
,
and
ascertain
that
he
be
not
require
by
his
master
,
determine
to
satisfy
himself
by
actual
observation
of
the
extent

ravage

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His

him
about
two
hour

detain
him
,
he
leave
the
house

sit
down

"
<EOS>
so
the
man
throw

,
say
,
they
would
bury

in
the
plague

pit

as

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
this
must
be
prevent
,
"
cry
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
which
way
do
the
dead
-
cart
go
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
towards
Moorgate
,
"
reply
the
drawer
.
 
<EOS>
Leonard
hear
no
more
;
but
dash
through
a
narrow
passage
opposite
the
Conduit
,
pass
Bartholomew

lane
,
and
traverse
Lothbury
,
soon
reach
Coleman

street
and
the
old
city
gate
,
to
which
he
have
be
direct
.
<EOS>
here
he
learn
that
the
dead

cart
have
pass
through
it
about
five
minute
before
,
and
he
hurry
on
towards
Finsbury
Fields
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
proceed
far
when
he
hear
a
sound
as
of
a
pipe
at
a
distance
,
furiously
play
,
and
accompany
by
the
barking
of
a
dog
.
<EOS>
these
sound
be
follow
by
cry
of
alarm
,
and
he
presently
perceive
two
person
run
towards
him
,
with
a
swiftness
which
only
could
be
occasion
by
terror
.
<EOS>
one
of
them
carry
a
lantern
,
and
grasp
his
arm
,
the
apprentice
detain
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
what

matter

"
<EOS>
he
ask

<EOS>
"

"
 
<EOS>
"
ay

"
observe
the
other

,
stop
likewise
.
<EOS>
"
I
toss
him
into

myself
,
and
will
swear

dead
enough
then
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
commit
a
dreadful
mistake
,
"
cry
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
toss
a
live
man
into
the
cart
instead
of
a
dead
one
.
<EOS>
do
you
not
hear
those
sound
?
"
<EOS>
and
as
he
speak
,
the
note
of
the
pipe
swell
to
a
loud
strain
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
it
be
the
devil
--
or
a
ghost
,
"
reply
the
driver
;
"
I
will
stay
here
no
longer

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"

I

You

"
 
<EOS>
pay
no
attention
to
what
be
say
,
Leonard
run
towards
the
cart
,
and
find
the
piper
seat
upon
a
pile
of
dead
body
,
most
of

<EOS>
III
.
 
<EOS>
the
dance
of
death
.
 
<EOS>
the
condition
of
the
prison
at
this
season
be
really
frightful
.
<EOS>
in
Newgate
,
in
particular
,
where
the
distemper
break
out
at
the
beginning
of
June
,
it
rage
with
such
violence
that
in
less
than
a
week
,
more
than
half
the
prisoner
be
sweep
off
,
and
it
appear
probable
,
that
,
unless
its
fury
abate
,
not
a
soul
would
be
leave
alive
within
it
.
<EOS>
at
all
time
,
this
crowd
and
ill
-
keep
prison
be
infest
by
the
gaol
-
fever
and
other
pestilential
disorder
,
but
these
be
mild
in
comparison
with
the
present
terrible
visitation
.
<EOS>
the
atmosphere
be
noisome
and
malignant
;
the
ward
be
never
cleanse
;
and
many
poor
wretch
,
who
die
in
their
cell
,
be
leave
there
till
the
attendant
on
the
dead
-
cart
choose
to
drag
them
forth
.
<EOS>
no
restraint
be
place
upon
the
sick
,
and
the
rule
of
the
prison
allow
them
the
free
use
of
any
strong
liquor
they
could
purchase
,
the
scene
that
occur
be
too
dreadful
and
revolt
for
description
,
and
could
only
be
parallel
by
the
orgy
of
a
pandemonium
.
<EOS>
many
reckless
being
,
conscious
that
they
be
attack
by
a
fatal
disorder
,
drink
as
long
as
they
could
raise
the
'
cup
to
their
lip
,
and
after
commit
the
wild
and
most
shocking
extravagance
,
die
in
a
state
of
frenzy
.
 
<EOS>
Newgate
become
thus
,
as
it
be
,
the
very
focus
of
infection
,
where
the
plague
assume
its
bad
aspect
,
and
where
its
victim
perish
far
more
expeditiously
than
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
two
of
the
turnkey
have
already
die
of
the
distemper
,
and
such
be
the
alarm
entertain
,
that
no
person
could
be
find
to
supply
their
place
.
<EOS>
to
penetrate
the
recess
of
the
prison
,
be
almost
to
insure
destruction
,
and
none
but
the
attendant
of
the
dead
-
cart
and
the
nurse
attempt
it
.
<EOS>
among
the
latter
be
Judith
.
<EOS>
employ
as
a
nurse
on
the
first
outburst
of
the
plague
,
she
willingly
and
fearlessly
undertake
the
office
.
<EOS>
the
bad
the
disease
become
the
better
please
she
appear
;
and
she
be
so
utterly
without
apprehension
,
that
when
no
one
would
approach
the
cell
where
some
wretched
sufferer
lie
expire
,
she
unhesitatingly
enter
it
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
to
render
aid
,
but
to
plunder
,
that
she
thus
exercise
her
function
.
<EOS>
She
administer
no
medicine
,
dress
no
tumour
,
and
do
not
contribute
in
the
slight
degree
to
the
comfort
of
the
miserable
wretch
commit
to
her
charge
.
<EOS>
all
she
desire
be
to
obtain
whatever
valuable
they
possess
,
or
to
wring
from
them
any
secret
that
may
afterwards
be
turn
to
account
.
<EOS>
foresee
that
Newgate
must
ere
long
be
depopulate
,
and
have
no
fear
for
herself
,
she
know
that
she
must
then
be
liberate
,
and
be
able
once
more
to
renew
her
mischievous
practice
upon
mankind
.
<EOS>
Her
marvellous
preservation
throughout
all
the
danger
to
which
she
be
expose
seem
almost
to
warrant
the
supposition
that
she
have
enter
into
a
compact
with
the
pestilence
,
to
extend
its
ravage
by
every
mean
in
her
power
,
on
the
condition
of
be
spare
herself
.
 
<EOS>
soon
after
the
outbreak
of
the
plague
in
Newgate
,
all
the
debtor
be
liberate
,
and
if
the
keeper
have
have
their
own
way
,
the
common
felon
would
have
be
likewise
release
.
<EOS>
but
this
could
not
be
,
and
they
be
keep
to
perish
as
before
describe
.
<EOS>
matter
,
however
,
grow
so
serious
,
that
it
become
a
question
whether
the
few
miserable
wretch
leave
alive
ought
to
be
longer
detain
,
and
at
last
the
turnkey
refuse
to
act
any
longer
,
and
deliver
their
key
to
the
governor
,
the
whole
of
the
prisoner
be
set
free
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
night
of
their
liberation
,
Chowles
and
Judith
proceed
to
the
vault
of
Saint
Faith
's
,
to
deposit
within
them
the
plunder
they
have
obtain
in
the
prison
.
<EOS>
They
find
them
entirely
desert
.
<EOS>
neither
verger
,
sexton
,
nor
any
other
person
,
be
to
be
see
,
and
they
take
up
their
quarter

<EOS>

Judith

untested

<EOS>
what
could
it
mean
?
<EOS>
neither
of
them
could
tell
.
<EOS>
It
seem
like
strain
of
unearthly
music
,
mix
with
shriek
and
groan
as
of
tortured
spirit
,
accompany
by
peal
of
such
laughter
as
may
be
suppose
to
proceed
,
from
demon

<EOS>
"
the

<EOS>
"
It

and
I

<EOS>
You

behold
your

<EOS>

"
 
<EOS>
as
he
speak
,
there
be
another
peal
of
infernal
laughter
,
and
the
strain
of
music
grow
louder
each
moment
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
what
may
,
I
will
see
what
it
be

<EOS>
"
I

Chowles--"but
<EOS>
I

"
 
<EOS>
"
then
I

<EOS>
"
Nay

replied
Chowles
,
totter
after
her
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
open
the
door
and
cross
the
charnel

such
an
extraordinary
combination
of
sound
burst
upon
their
ear
that
they
again
pause

and
look
anxiously
at

<EOS>
chowle

"
I

<EOS>
both
be
too
well

with
the
way
to
need
any

<EOS>
ascend
the
broad
stone
step
,
they
presently
emerge
into
the
cathedral
,
which
they
find
illumine
by
the
same
glimmering
light
as
the
low
church
,
and
they
perceive
the
ghostly
assemblage
gather
into
an
immense
ring
,
and
dance
round
the
tall
skeleton

they
have
to

being

<EOS>
accordingly
,
they
approach
the
party
of
masquer
,
for
such
they
prove
,
and
find
on
inquiry
that
they
be
a
party
of
young
gallant

who
,
head
by
the
Earl

the

and
the

in
the
erection
of
his

palace
in
the
Strand
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
discussion
of
these
singular
painting
,
and
of
the
design
on
the
same
subject
ascribe
to
Holbein
,
that

the
Earl
of
Rochester
and
his
companion
to
propose
the
fantastic
spectacle
above

<EOS>
with
the
disposition
which
this
reckless
nobleman
possess
to
turn
the
most
solemn
and
appalling
subject
to
jest
,
he
think
no
season
so
fitting
for
such
an
entertainment

just

the
lively
Parisians
make
the
cholera
,
while
rage
in
their
city
,
the
subject

the
exhibition

Chowles

rehearsal
of

towards
the
south
door
of
the
cathedral
,
which

throw
open
by
an
unseen
hand

and
the
procession
glide
through
it
like
a
troop

spectre

<EOS>
chowle
,
whose
appearance

an
animated

be
seize
with
a
strange
desire
to
join
in
what
be
go
forward
,
and
take
off
his
doublet
,
and
bare
his
bony
arm
and
leg
,
he
follow
the
other
,
dance
round
Judith
in
the

manner
that
the
other
skeleton
dance
round
their
partner

<EOS>
on

the
Convocation
House

a
door
be
open

the
procession
enter
the
cloister
;
and
here
Chowles
,
drag
Judith
into
the
area
between
him
and
the
beautiful
structure
they
surround
,
begin
a
dance
of
so
extraordinary
a
character
that
the
whole
troop
collect
round
to
witness
it
.
<EOS>
Rochester
beat
his
drum
,
and
the
other
representative
of
mortality
who
be
provide
with
musical
instrument
strike
up
a
wild
kind
of
accompaniment
,
to
which
Chowles
execute
the
most
grotesque
flourish
.
<EOS>
so
wildly
excited
do
he
become
,
and
such
extravagance
<EOS>
do
he
commit
,
that
even
Judith
stare
aghast
at
him
,
and
begin
to
think
his
wit
be
flee
.
<EOS>
now
he
whirl
round
her
--
now
spring
high
into
the
air
--
now
twine
his
lean
arm
round
her
waist
--
now
peep
over
one
shoulder
,
now
over
the
other
--
and
at
last
gripe
her
neck
so
forcibly
,
that
he
may
perhaps
have
strangle
her
,
if
she
have
not
break
from
him
,
and
deal
him
a
severe
blow
that
bring
him
senseless
to
the
ground

<EOS>
on
recover
,
he
find
himself
in
the
arched
entrance
of

octagonal
chamber

the
guest
by
the
earl

servant

all
of

and
it
have
a
strange
effect

to
behold
these
ghastly
object
fill
the
cup
of
the
reveller
,
bend
obsequiously
before
some
bloom
dame
,

round
their
spectral

looking
lord

<EOS>
at
first
,
Chowles
be
so
confused
,
that
he
think
he
must
have
awaken
in
another
world
,
but
by
degree
he
call
to
mind
what
have
occur

and
ascertain
from
Judith
that
he
be
in
the
Convocation
House
.
<EOS>
get
up
,
he
join
the
train
of
grisly
attendant

and
acquit
himself
so
well
that
the
earl
engage
him
as
performer
in
the
masque
.
<EOS>
He
be
furthermore
inform
that
,
in
all
probability
,
the
king
himself
,
with
many
of
his
favourite
noble
,
and
the
chief
court
beauty
,
would
be
present
to
witness
the
spectacle
.
 
<EOS>
the
banquet
over

word
be
bring
that
chair
and
coach
be
without

and
the
company
depart
,
leave
behind
only
a

remain
to
put
matter
in

<EOS>
while

to
Chowles

<EOS>
"
You

do
it
yourself

in

shall
have
to

<EOS>
perceiving
they
be

Chowles

then
leave
the

return
to
the
vault
in
Saint

they
emerge
from

until
late
on
the
follow
day

<EOS>
some
rumour
of
the
masque
have
go
abroad
,
towards
evening
a
crowd
,
chiefly
compose
of
the
most
worthless
order
of
society
,
collect
under
the
portico
at
the
western
entrance
,
and
the
great
door
be
open
by
chowle
<EOS>
,
they
enter
the
cathedral

<EOS>
thus
be
this
sacred
building
once
more
invaded
--
once
again
a
scene
of
noise
,
riot
,
and
confusion
--
its
vaulted
roof
instead
of
echo
the
voice
of
prayer
,
or
the
choral
hymn
,
resound
with
loud
laughter
,
imprecation
,
and
licentious
discourse
.
<EOS>
this
disorder
,
however
,
be
keep
in
some
bound
by
a
strong
body
of
the
royal
guard

who
soon
afterwards
arrive
,
and
station
themselves
in
party
of
three
or
four
at
each
of
the
massive
column
flank
the
aisle

maintain
some
show
of
decorum

<EOS>
besides
these
,
there
be
other
of
the
royal
attendant

bear
torch

who
walk
from

I

and
afraid

she
should
run
back

her
master

he
continue
to
carry
her

caress

endearment

kindness
by
lick
his

but
she
still
remain
inconsolable

and
ever
and
anon
struggle
to
get
free

<EOS>
make
the
good
of
his
way
to
wood

street

he
enter
the
hutch

and
place
a
little
straw
in
one
corner
for
Bell
,
throw
himself
on
a
bench

drop
asleep

<EOS>
at

<EOS>
to
Leonard
's
eager
inquiry
after
Amabel

Mr.
Bloundel
reply
by
a
melancholy
shake
of
the
head
,
and
soon
afterwards
withdraw
.
<EOS>
with
a
sad
heart
,
the
apprentice
then
break
his
fast,--not
forgetting
at
the

time
the
want

his
little
companion,--and
finding

He

I

<EOS>

a
strange
idea
cross
me

Leonard

<EOS>
"
Can
it
be
the
king
who
have
assume
this
disguise
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
at
one
time
I
suspect
as
much
,
"
rejoin
hodge
;
"
but
set
aside
your
description
of
the
person
,
which
do
not
tally
with
that
of
Charles
,
I
be
satisfied
from
other
circumstance
it
be
not
so
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
I
should
not
wonder
if
poor
Bell
,
"
smooth
her
long
silky
ear
as
she
lie
in
the
apprentice
's
arm
,
"
should
help
us
to
discover
her
mistress

<EOS>
and
now
,
"
he
add
,
"
I
shall
go
to
wood
-
street
to
inquire
after
Amabel
,
and
will
then
accompany
you
to
the
pest

house
.
<EOS>
from
what
you
tell
me
the
young
chirurgeon
say
of
the
piper

I
do
not
despair
of
his
recovery

poor
as
his

it

well

ah
!
"
exclaim
Hodges
,
in
a
sorrowful
tone
<EOS>
,
"
hers
be
slight
indeed

<EOS>
and
perceive
that
the
apprentice
be
greatly
move
,
he
wait
for
a
moment
till
he
have
recover
himself
,
and
then
,
motion
him
to
follow
him

they
quit
the
house
together

on
reach
Mr.

this
morning

he

in

I

bad

draw
up

He
return
in
about
half
an
hour

his
grave
countenance
convince
Leonard
that
his
bad
anticipation

correct

<EOS>
He
therefore
forbear
to

him
,

they
walk
towards
Cripplegate
in
silence

on
emerge
into
the
field

Hodges
observe
to
his
companion

so
it

I
be
happy
to

I
have
prevail
on
her
,
if

there

it,--to
try
the
effect

I
be

Leonard

passionately

the
conversation
then
drop

they
walk
briskly
forward

<EOS>
They
be
now
within
a
short
distance
of
the
pest

house

and
Leonard
,
hear
footstep
behind
him
,
turn
and
beheld
a
close
litter
,
bear
by
two
stout
porter

and
evidently
contain
a
plague

patient

<EOS>
He
step
aside
to
let
it
pass
,
when
Bell
,
suddenly
prick
her
ear
,
utter
a
singular
cry
,
and
burst
from
him
,
fly
after
the
litter
,
leap
against
it
and
bark
joyfully
.
<EOS>
the
porter

who
be
proceed
at
a
quick
pace
,
try
to
drive
her
away
,

without
effect
,
and
she
continue
her
cry
until
they
reach
the
gate
of
the
pest

<EOS>
in
vain
Leonard
whistle
to
her
,

call
her
back

<EOS>
She
pay
no
attention
whatever
to
him

<EOS>
"
I
almost
begin
to
fear
,

Hodges
,
unable
to
repress
a
shudder
,
"
that
the
poor
animal

indeed

be
the

<EOS>
"
I
understand

as

forward

It

over

time

at

She

<EOS>
Leonard
here
seize
Bell

fear
she
may
do
some
mischief
,
and
with
a
sad
foreboding
beheld
the
man
draw
back
the
curtain
of
the
litter
.
<EOS>
His
fear
prove
well
found
.
<EOS>
there
,
stretch
upon
the
couch
,
with
her
dark
hair
unbound
,
and
flow
in
wild
disorder
over
her
neck
,
lie
Nizza
Macascree
.
<EOS>
the
ghastly
paleness
of
her
face
could
not
,
however
,
entirely
rob
it
of
its
beauty
,
and
her
dark
eye
be
glaze
and
lustreless
.
<EOS>
at
the
sight
of
her
mistress
,
poor
Bell
utter
so
piteous
a
cry
,
that
Leonard

move
by
compassion
,
place
her
on
the
pillow
beside
her
,
and
the
sagacious
animal
do
not
attempt
to
approach
nearer
,
but
merely
lick
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
rouse
by
the
touch
,
Nizza
turn
to
see
what
be
near
her
,
and
recognise
the
animal
,
make
a
movement
to
strain
her
to
her
bosom
,
but
the
pain
she
endure
be
so
intense
that
she
sink
back
with
a
deep
groan

<EOS>
"
from
whom

pursue
Hodges
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
the

reply
the
fellow
;

I
should
judge

from

"
<EOS>
inquire
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
if
she
think
life
worth
a
struggle
--
if
,
in
short
,
she
believe
you
would
return
her
attachment
,
she
would
rally
,
"
answer
hodge
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
consent
to
deceive
her
thus
,
"
rejoin
Leonard
,
sadly
.
<EOS>
"
My
heart
be
fix
elsewhere
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
heart
be
fix
upon
one
who
will
soon
be
in
her
grave
,
"
reply
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
with
her
my
affection
will
be
bury
,
"
rejoin
Leonard
,
turn
away
to
hide
his
tear
.
 
<EOS>
so
well
be
the
doctor
's
solicitude
reward
,
that
three
day
after
Nizza
have
come
under
his
care
,
he
pronounce
her
out
of
danger
.
<EOS>
but
the
violence
of
the
attack
leave
her
so
weak
and
exhausted
,
that
he
still
would
not
allow
an
interview
to
take
place
between
her
and
Leonard
.
<EOS>
during
all
this
time
Bell
never
leave
her
side
,
and
her
presence
be
an
inexpressible
comfort
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
piper
,
too
,
be
slowly
recover
,
and
Leonard
,
who
daily
visit
him
,
be
glad
to
learn
from
the
young
chirurgeon
that
he
would
be
able
to
leave
the
pest
-
house
shortly
.
<EOS>
have
ascertain
from
Leonard
that
his
daughter
be
under
the
care
of
Doctor
Hodges
,
and
likely
to
do
well
,
the
piper
beg
so
earnestly
that
the
packet
may
not
be
deliver
to
her
,
that
,
after
some
consultation
with
Hodges
,
Leonard
restore
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
delighted
to
get
it
back
,
feel
it
carefully
over
to
ascertain
that
the
seal
be
unbroken
,
and
satisfy
that
all
be
safe
,
have
it
again
sew
up
in
his
gown
,
which
he
place
under
his
pillow
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
disclose
the
secret
to
her
by
word
of
mouth
than
in
any
other
way
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
Leonard
feel
doubtful
whether
the
secret
would
now
be
disclose
at
all
,
but
he
make
no
remark
.
 
<EOS>
Night
be
draw
on
as
he
quit
the
pest
-
house
,
and
he
determine
to
take
this
opportunity
of
visit
the
great
plague
-
pit
,
which
lie
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
,
in
a
line
with
the
church
of
All
-
Hallows
-
in
-
the
-
Wall
,
and
he
accordingly
proceed
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
the
pit
which
he
be
about
to
visit
be
about
forty
foot
long
,
twenty
wide
,
and
the
like
number
deep
.
<EOS>
into
this
tremendous
chasm
the
dead
be
promiscuously
throw
,
without
regard
to
sex
or
condition
,
generally
strip
of
their
clothing
,
and
cover
with
a
slight
layer
of
earth
and
quick
lime
.
 
<EOS>
the
sun
be
set
as
Leonard
walk
towards
this
dismal
place
,
and
he
think
he
have
never
witness
so
magnificent
a
sight
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
remark
that
at
this
fatal
season
the
sunset
be
unusually
splendid
.
<EOS>
the
glorious
orb
sink
slowly
behind
Saint
Paul
's
,
which
form
a
prominent
object
in
the
view
from
the
field
,
and
throw
out
its
central
tower
,
its
massive
roof
,
and
the
two
less
tower
flank
the
portico
,
into
strong
relief
.
<EOS>
Leonard
gaze
at
the
mighty
fabric
,
which
seem
dilate
to
twice
its
size
by
this
light
,
and
wonder
whether
it
be
possible
that
it
could
ever
be
destroy
,
as
predict
by
Solomon
Eagle
.
 
<EOS>
long
after
the
sun
have
set
,
the
sky
be
stain
with
crimson
,
and
the
grey
wall
of
the
city
be
tinge
with
rosy
radiance
.
<EOS>
the
heat
be
intense
,
and
Leonard
,
to
cool
himself
,
sit
down
in
the
thick
grass
--
for
,
though
the
crop
be
ready
for
the
scythe
,
no
mower
could
be
find
--
and
,
gaze
upwards
,
strove
to
mount
in
spirit
from
the
tainted
earth
towards
heaven
.
<EOS>
after
a
while
he
arise
,
and
proceed
towards
the
plague
-
pit
.
<EOS>
the
grass
be
trample
down
near
it
,
and
there
be
mark
of
frequent
cart
-
wheel
upon
the
sod
.
<EOS>
great
heap
of
soil
,
throw
out
of
the
excavation
,
lie
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
hold
a
handkerchief
steep
in
vinegar
to
his
face
,
Leonard
venture
to
the
brink
of
the
pit
.
<EOS>
but
even
this
precaution
could
not
counteract
the
horrible
effluvia
arise
from
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
more
than
half
fill
with
dead
body
;
and
through
the
putrid
and
heave
mass
many
disjoint
limb
and
ghastly
face
could
be
discern
,
the
long
hair
of
woman
and
the
tiny
arm
of
child
appear
on
the
surface
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
horrible
sight
--
so
horrible
,
that
it
possess
a
fascination
peculiar
to
itself
,
and
,
in
spite
of
his
loathing
,
Leonard
linger
to
gaze
at
it
.
<EOS>
strange
and
fantastic
thought
possess
him
.
<EOS>
He
fancy
that
the
leg
and
arm
move
--
that
the
eye
of
some
of
the
corpse
open
and
glare
at
him
--
and
that
the
whole
rot
mass
be
endow
with
animation
.
<EOS>
so
appalled
be
he
by
this
idea
that
he
turn
away
,
and
at
that
moment
behold
a
vehicle
approach
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
dead
-
cart
,
charge
with
a
heavy
load
to
increase
the
already
redundant
heap
.
 
<EOS>
the
same
inexplicable
and
irresistible
feeling
of
curiosity
that
induce
Leonard
to
continue
gaze
upon
the
loathly
object
in
the
pit
,
now
prompt
him
to
stay
and
see
what
would
ensue
.
<EOS>
two
person
be
with
the
cart
,
and
one
of
them
,
to
Leonard
's
infinite
surprise
and
disgust
,
prove
to
be
Chowles
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
time
,
however
,
for
the
expression
of
any
sentiment
,
for
the
cart
halt
at
a
little
distance
from
him
,
when
its
conductor
,
turn
it
round
,
back
it
towards
the
edge
of
the
pit
.
<EOS>
the
horse
be
then
take
out
,
and
chowle
call
to
Leonard
,
the
latter
involuntarily
knelt
down
to
guide
its
descent
,
while
the
other
assistant
,
who
have
proceed
to
the
further
side
of
the
chasm
,
throw
the
light
of
a
lantern
full
upon
the
grisly
load
,
which
be
thus
shoot
into
the
gulf
below
.
 
<EOS>
shovel
a
sufficient
quantity
of
earth
and
lime
into
the
pit
to
cover
the
body
,
Chowles
and
his
companion
depart
,
leave
Leonard
alone
.
<EOS>
He
continue
there
a
few
moment
longer
,
and
be
about
to
follow
them
,
when
a
prolonged
and
piercing
cry
smote
his
ear
;
and
,
look
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
,
he
perceive
a
figure
run
with
great
swiftness
towards
the
pit
.
<EOS>
as
no
pursuer
appear
,
Leonard
could
scarcely
doubt
that
this
be
one
of
the
distracted
person
he
have
hear
of
,
who
,
in
the
frenzy
produce
by
the
intolerable
anguish
of
their
sore
,
would
often
rush
to
the
plague
-
pit
and
bury
themselves
,
and
he
therefore
resolve
,
if
possible
,
to
prevent
the
fatal
attempt
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
he
place
himself
in
the
way
of
the
runner
,
and
endeavour
,
with
outstretche
arm
,
to
stop
him
.
<EOS>
but
the
latter
dash
him
aside
with
great
violence
,
and
hurry
to
the
brink
of
the
pit
,
utter
a
fearful
cry
,
and
exclaim
,
<EOS>
"
She
be
here
!
<EOS>
she
be
here!--I
shall
find
her
amongst
them!"--flung
himself
into
the
abyss
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
could
shake
off
the
horror
inspire
by
this
dreadful
action
,
Leonard
run
to
the
pit
,
and
,
gaze
into
it
,
beheld
him
by
the
imperfect
light
struggle
in
the
horrible
mass
in
which
he
be
partially
immerse
.
<EOS>
the
frenzied
man
have
now
,
however
,
begin
to
repent
his
rashness
,
and
cry
out
for
aid
.
<EOS>
but
this
Leonard
find
it
impossible
to
afford
him
;
and
,
see
he
must
speedily
perish
if
leave
to
himself
,
he
run
after
the
dead
-
cart
,
and
overtake
it
just
as
it
reach
Moor
-
gate
,
inform
Chowles
what
have
happen
,
and
beg
him
to
return
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
will
be
no
use
in
help
him
out
,
"
rejoin
Chowles
,
in
a
tone
of
indifference
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
to
take
him
back
in
a
couple
of
hour
.
<EOS>
no
,
no
--
let
him
remain
where
he
be
.
<EOS>
there
be
scarcely
a
night
that
some
crazy
being
do
not
destroy
himself
in
the
same
way
.
<EOS>
We
never
concern
ourselves
about
such
person
except
to
strip
them
of
their
apparel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
unfeeling
wretch
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Leonard
,
unable
to
restrain
his
indignation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
give
me
your
fork
,
and
I
will
pull
him
out
myself
.

"
 
<EOS>
instead
of
surrender
the
implement
,
Chowles
flourish
it
over
his
head
with
the
intention
of
strike
the
apprentice
,
but
the
latter
nimbly
avoid
the
blow
,
and
snatch
it
from
his
grasp
,
run
back
to
the
plague
-
pit
.
<EOS>
He
be
follow
by
Chowles
and
the
burier
,
who
threaten
him
with
loud
oath
.
<EOS>
regardless
of
their
menace
,
Leonard
fix
the
hook
in
the
dress
of
the
struggle
man
,
and
exert
all
his
strength
,
draw
him
out
of
the
abyss
.
<EOS>
He
have
just
lodge
him
in
safety
on
the
brink
when
Chowles
and
his
companion
come
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
keep
off
!

<EOS>
cry
Leonard

brandish
his
fork
as
he
speak
;

I

"
 
<EOS>
Chowles
comply

and
hold
the
light
over
the
unfortunate
person
.
<EOS>
His
attire
be
rich
,
but
in
great
disorder
,
and
sully
by
the
loathsome
mass
in
which
he
have
be
plunge

<EOS>
He
be
in
the
flower
of
youth

and
his
feature
must
have
be
remarkable
for
their
grace

beauty

but
they

of

remember
what
I

nothing

I
will
not

it

and
with
the
help
of
Jonas

the

"
You

himself
at

You
know
his

me

but
no
matter
who
he
be

he
be
rich
enough
to

well

<EOS>
so
stand
aside
,

let
us
go

We
have
no

in
further
parleying

I
will
not

Leonard

<EOS>
"
We
will
see
to
that
,

Jonas
,
approach
him
behind
,

deal
him
so
severe
a
blow
on
the
head

stretch
him
senseless
on

Shall
we
throw

into

pit

add
to
Chowles

<EOS>
the
latter
hesitate
for
a
moment
,
and
then
say
,
"
no
,
no

it
be
not
worth

It
may
bring
us
into
trouble

We

they
then
put
the
cart
in
motion

and
take
the
way
to
Saint
Paul

.
 
<EOS>
on
come
to
himself
,
Leonard
have
some
difficulty
in
recall
what
have
happen
;
and
when
the
whole
train
of
circumstance
rush
upon
his
mind
,
he
congratulate
himself
that
he
have
escape
further
injury
.
<EOS>
"
when
I
think
of
the
hand
I
have
be
place
in
,
"
he
murmur
,
"
I
can
not
but
be
grateful
that
they
do
not
throw
me
into
the
pit
,
where
no
discovery
could
have
be
make
as
to
how
I
come
to
an
end

<EOS>
but
I
will
not
rest
till
I
have
ascertain
the
name
and
rank
of
Nizza
's
persecutor
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
they
have
take
him
to
Saint
Paul
's
,
and
will
proceed
thither
at
once

"
 
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
he
hasten
towards
the
near
city
gate
,
and
pass
towards
it

shape
his
course
towards
the
cathedral

<EOS>
It
be
a
fine
starlight
night
,
and
though
there
be
no
moon
,
the
myriad
lustre
glow
in
the
deep
and
cloudless
vault
render
every
object
plainly
distinguishable
.
<EOS>
at
this
hour
,
little
restraint
be
place
upon
the
sick
,
and
they
wander
about
the
street
utter
dismal
cry
.
<EOS>
some
would
fling
themselves
upon
bulk
or
step
,
where
they
be
not
unfrequently
find
the
next
morning
bereft
of
life
.
<EOS>
Most
of
those
not
attack
by
the
distemper
keep
close
house
;
but
there
be
some
few
reckless
being
who
pass
the
night
in
the
wildest
revelry
,
brave
the
fate
await
them
.
<EOS>
as
Leonard
pass
Saint
Michael
's
church
,
in
Basinghall
-
street
,
he
perceive
,
to
his
great
surprise
,
that
it
be
light
up
,
and
at
first
suppose
some
service
be
go
on
within
it
,
but
on
approach
he
hear
strain
of
lively
and
most
irreverent
music
issue
from
within
.
<EOS>
push
open
the
door
,
he
enter
the
sacred
edifice
,
and
find
it
occupy
by
a
party
of
twenty
young
man
,
accompany
by
a
like
number
of
female
,
some
of
whom
be
play
at
dice
and
card
,
some
drinking
,
<EOS>
other
singe
bacchanalian
melody
,
other
dance
along
the
aisle
to
the
note
of
a
theorbo
and
spinet
.
<EOS>
Leonard
be
so
inexpressibly
shock
by
what
he
behold
,
that
unable
to
contain
himself
<EOS>
he
mount
the
step
of
the
pulpit
,
and
call
to
them
in
a
loud
voice
to
desist
from
their
scandalous
conduct
,
and
no
longer
profane
the
house
of
God
.
<EOS>
but
they
treat
his
remonstrance
with
laughter
and
derision
,
and
some
of
the
party
form
themselves
into
a
group
round
the
pulpit
,
entreat
him
to
preach
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
want
a
little
variety

one
of
the
group

a
good

look
young
man

upon
whom
the
wine

evidently
make
some
impression--"we

Leonard

<EOS>
"

I

you
be

however

by
a
cry
of
anguish
from
one
of
the
party

<EOS>
"
there

Will

You

We

and
be
therefore
resolve
to
banish
reflection
.
<EOS>
a
week
ago
,
the
Brotherhood
of
Saint
Michael
consist
of
forty
person
.
<EOS>
We
be
already
diminish
to
half
the
number
,
but
be
not
the
less
merry
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
we
be
more
jovial
than
ever
.
<EOS>
We
have
agree
that
whoever
shall
be
seize
with
the

shall
be
instantly

so
that
the
hilarity
of

shall
not

<EOS>
the
poor
fellow
who
have
just
be
attack
have
leave
behind
him
a
beautiful
mistress
.
<EOS>
She
be
yours
if
you
choose
to
join
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
stop
with
us
,
"
cry
a
young
and
very
pretty
woman
,
take
his
hand
and
draw
him
towards
the
company
who
be
dance
beneath
the
aisle
.
 
<EOS>
but
Leonard
disengage
himself
,
and
hurry
away
amid
the
laughter
and
hooting
of
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
the
street
,
despite
their
desolate
appearance
,
be
preferable
to
the
spot
he
have
just
quit
,
and
he
seem
to
breathe
more
freely
when
he
get
to
a
little
distance
from
the
polluted
fane
.
<EOS>
He
have
now
enter
wood
-
street
,
but
all
be
as
still
as
death
,
and
he
pause
to
gaze
up
at
his
master
's
window
,
but
there
be
no
one
at
it
.
<EOS>
many
a
lover
,
unable
to
behold
the
object
of
his
affection
,
have
in
some
measure
satisfy
the
yearning
of
his
heart
by
gaze
at
her
dwelling
,
and
feel
he
be
near
her
.
<EOS>
many
a
sad
heart
have
be
cheer
by
behold
a
light
at
a
window
,
or
a
shadow
on
its
closed
curtain
,
and
such
would
have
be
Leonard
's
feeling
if
he
have
not
be
depress
by
the
thought
of
Amabel
's
precarious
state
of
health
.
 
<EOS>
while
thus
wrapt
in
mournful
thought
,
he
observe
three
figure
slowly
approach
from
the
further
end
of
the
street
,
and
he
instinctively
withdraw
into
a
doorway
.
<EOS>
He
have
reason
to
congratulate
himself
upon
the
precaution
,
as
,
when
the
party
draw
near
,
he
recognise
,
with
a
pang
that
shoot
to
his
heart
,
the
voice
of
Rochester
.
<EOS>
a
moment
's
observation
from
his
place
of
concealment
show
him
that
the
earl
be
accompany
by
Sir
George
Etherege
and
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
They
pause
within
a
short
distance
of
him
,
and
he
could
distinctly
hear
their
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
not

here

Etherege
to
Rochester

after
the
latter
have
gaze
for
a
few
moment
in
silence
at
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
be
you

<EOS>
"
You

my

precisely

Rochester

"
<EOS>
Doctor
Hodges
have
inform
a
friend
of
mine
that
the
pretty
Amabel

fall
into
a
decline
.
<EOS>
the
poor
soul
be

doubtless
,
pine
for
me

it
would
be
the
height
of
inhumanity
to
let
her
perish

<EOS>
Leonard
grind
his
tooth
-
with
suppressed
rage

then
you

all

"
I

<EOS>
"
Old
Bowley

Rochester
;

and
though
his
threat
would
scarcely
deter
me
from
act
as
I
think
proper

I
have
no
inclination

at

what
a

Etherege

that

not

<EOS>

that
be

Etherege
,
laughingly
;
"
especially
where
you
have
a
friend
so
devoted

myself

do
you

off

Your

with

sneer

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no

nothing

Your

I

She

"
 
<EOS>
"
You

reply
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
a
singular
being
,
certainly
--
once
a
coffin
-
maker
,
and
now
,
I
believe
,
a
burier
of
the
dead
.
<EOS>
He
take
up
his
abode
in
a
crypt
of
Saint
Faith
's
and
lead
an
incomprehensible
life
.
<EOS>
as
we
return
we
shall
pass
the
cathedral
,
and
can
see
whether
he
be
astir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
readily
,
"
reply
Etherege
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
you
desire
to
tarry
here
longer
,
or
shall
we
proceed
before
you

while
you
indulge
your
tender
meditation
undisturbed
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
leave
me

"
reply
Rochester
;
"
I
shall
be
glad
to
be
alone
for
a
few
moment

"
 
<EOS>
Etherege
and
Pillichody
then
proceed
slowly
towards
Cheapside
,
while
the
earl
remain
with
his
arm
fold
upon
his
breast
,
and
his
gaze
fix
upon
the
house
.
<EOS>
Leonard
watch
him
with
intense
curiosity
,
and
have
great
difficulty
in
control
himself
.
<EOS>
though
the
earl
be
armed
,
while
he
have
only
his
staff
,
he
could
have
easily
master
him
by
assail
him
unawares
.
<EOS>
but
Leonard
's
generous
nature
revolt
at
the
unworthy
suggestion
,
and
he
resolve
,
if
he
attack
him
at
all
,
to
give
him
time
to
stand
upon
his
guard
.
<EOS>
a
moment
's
reflection
,
however
,
satisfy
him
that
his
wise
course
would
be
to
remain
conceal
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
in
possession
of
the
earl
's
plan
,
and
,
with
the
help
of
Doctor
Hodges
,
could
easily
defeat
it
;
whereas
if
he
appear
,
it
would
be
evident
that
he
have
overhear
what
have
pass
,
and
some
other
scheme
,
to
which
he
could
not
be
privy
,
would
be
necessarily
adopt
.
<EOS>
influence
by
this
consideration
,
he
suffer
the
earl
to
depart
unmoleste
,
and
when
he
have
get
to
some
distance
follow

<EOS>

in
Cheapside

,
join

they
all
three
proceed
towards
the
cathedral

<EOS>
They
enter
the
great
northern

;
and
Leonard
,
who
be
now
well
acquaint
with
all
the
approach
,
pass
through
the
door
at
the
north
side
of
the
choir
,
to
which
he
have
be
direct
on
a
former
occasion
by
Solomon

<EOS>
He
find
the
party

by
the
old
verger
--
the
only
one
of
its
former
keeper
who
still
linger
about
the
place
--
and
prepare
to
descend
to
Saint
Faith

.
<EOS>
Leonard
follow
as
near
as
he
could
without
expose
himself
,
and
,
on
gain
the
subterranean
church
,
easily
contrive
to
screen
himself
behind
the
ponderous
rank
of
pillar
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
they
have
reach
the
door
of
the
charnel
It
be
closed
;
but
Rochester
knock
against
it
,
and
Chowles
presently
appear
.
<EOS>
He
seem
greatly
surprised
at
see
the
earl
,
nor
be
the
latter
less
astonished
when
he
learn
that
Parravicin
be

the
vault
.
<EOS>
He
desire
to
be

to
his
friend

and
Chowles
usher
him
into
the
crypt
.
<EOS>
Leonard
would
have
follow
them
;
but
as
Etherege
and
the
other
decline
enter
the
charnel
,
and
remain
at
the
door
,
he
could
not
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
shortly
after
this
the
sick
man

HOW
SAINT
PATHOS
be
use
as
a
PEST
-
HOUSE
.
 
<EOS>
the
distemper
have
by
this
time
increase
to
such
a
frightful
extent
,
that
the
pest
-
house
be
find
wholly
inadequate
to
contain
the
number
of
sick
person
send
to
them
,
it
be
resolve
by
the
civic
authority
,
who
have
obtain
the
sanction
of
the
Dean
and
Chapter
of
Saint
Paul
's
for
that
purpose
,
to
convert
the
cathedral
into
a
receptacle
for
the
infect
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
a
meeting
be
hold
in
the
Convocation
House
to
make
final
arrangement
.
<EOS>
It
be
attend
by
Sir
John
Lawrence
,
the
Lord
Mayor
;
by
Sir
George
Waterman
,
and
Sir
Charles
Doe
,
sheriff
;
by
Doctor
Sheldon
,
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
;
by
the
Duke
of
Albemarle
,
the
Earl
of
Craven
,
and
,
a
few
other
zealous
and
humane
person
.
<EOS>
several
member
of
the
College
of
Physicians
be
likewise
present
,
and
,
amongst
other
,
Doctor
Hodges
;
and
the
expediency
of
the
measure
be
fully
agree
upon
,
it
be
determined
to
carry
it
into
immediate
execution
.
 
<EOS>
the
cloister
surround
the
Convocation
House
be
crowd
with
sick
person
,
draw
thither
by
the
rumour
of
what
be
go
forward
;
and
when
the
meeting
adjourn
to
the
cathedral
,
these
unfortunate
being
follow
them
,
and
be
with
some
difficulty
keep
aloof
from
the
uninfected
by
the
attendant
.
<EOS>
a
very
earnest
and
touching
address
be
next
pronounce
by
the
archbishop
.
<EOS>
call
upon
his
hearer
to
look
upon
themselves
as
already
dead
to
the
world,--to
regard
the
present
visitation
as
a
just
punishment
of
their
sin
,
and
to
rejoice
that
their
suffering
would
be
so
soon
terminate
,
when
,
if
they
sincerely
and
heartily
repent
,
they
would
at
once
be
transport
from
the
depth
of
wretchedness
and
misery
to
region
of
unfade
bliss
;
he
conclude
by
state
that
he
,
and
all
those
around
him
,
be
prepare
to
devote
themselves
,
without
regard
to
their
own
safety
,
to
the
preservation
of
their
fellow
-
citizen
,
and
that
they
would
leave
nothing
undone
to
stop
the
ravage
of
the
devour
scourge
.
 
<EOS>
It
chance
that
Leonard
Holt
be
present
on
this
occasion
,
and
as
he
listen
to
the
eloquent
discourse
of
the
archbishop
,
and
gaze
at
the
group
around
him
,
all
equally
zealous
in
the
good
cause
,
and
equally
regardless
of
themselves
,
he
could
not
but
indulge
a
hope
that
their
exertion
may
be
crown
with
success
.
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
a
touching
sight
to
see
the
melancholy
congregation
to
whom
his
address
be
deliver
--
many
,
nay
most
of
whom
be
on
the
verge
of
dissolution;--and
<EOS>
Leonard
Holt
be
so
move
by
the
almost
apostolic
fervour
of
the
prelate
,
<EOS>
that
,
but
for
the
thought
of
Amabel
,
he
may
have
follow
the
example
of
several
of
the
auditor
,
and
devote
himself
altogether
to
the
service
of
the
sick
.
 
<EOS>
His
discourse
conclude
,
the
archbishop
and
most
of
his
companion
quit
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
hodge
,
however
,
and
three
of
the
physician
,
remain
behind
to
superintend
the
necessary
preparation
.
<EOS>
shortly
after
,
a
large
number
of
pallet
be
bring
in
,
and
range
along
the
nave
and
aisle
at
short
distance
from
each
other
;
and
,
before
night
,
the
interior
of
the
structure
present
the
complete
appearance
of
an
hospital
.
<EOS>
act
under
the
direction
of
Doctor
Hodges
,
Leonard
Holt
lend
his
assistance
in
arrange
the
pallet
,
in
cover
them
with
bedding
and
blanket
,
and
in
execute
any
other
service
require
of
him
.
<EOS>
a
sufficient
number
of
chirurgeon
and
nurse
be
then
send
for
,
and
such
be
the
expedition
use
,
that
on
that
very
night
most
of
the
pallet
be
occupy
.
<EOS>
thus
the
cathedral
undergo
another
afflict
change
.
<EOS>
a
blight
have
come
over
it
,
mildew
its
holy
wall
,
and
taint
and
pollute
its
altar
.
<EOS>
Its
aisle
,
once
trodden
by
grave
and
reverend
ecclesiastic
,
and
subsequently
haunt
by
ruffler
,
bully
,
and
other
worthless
character
,
be
now
fill
with
miserable
wretch
,
stricken
with
a
loathsome
and
fatal
distemper
.
<EOS>
Its
chapel
and
shrine
formerly
adorn
with
rich
sculpture
and
costly
ornament
,
but
strip
of
them
at
time
when
they
be
look
upon
as
idolatrous
and
profane
,
be
now
occupy
by
nurse
,
chirurgeon
,
and
their
attendant
;
while
every
niche
and
corner
be
fill
with
surgical
implement
,
phial
,
drug
,
poultice
,
foul
rag
,
and
linen
.
 
<EOS>
in
less
than
a
week
after
it
have
be
convert
into
a
pest
-
house
,
the
cathedral
be
crowd
to
overflow
.
<EOS>
upwards
of
three
hundred
pallet
be
set
up
in
the
nave
,
in
the
aisle
,
in
the
transept
,
and
in
the
choir
,
and
even
in
the
chapel
.
<EOS>
but
these
prove
insufficient
,
many
poor
wretch
who
be
bring
thither
be
place
on
the
cold
flag
,
and
protect
only
by
a
single
blanket
.
<EOS>
at
night
the
scene
be
really
terrific
.
<EOS>
the
imperfect
light
borne
by
the
attendant
fall
on
the
couch
,
and
reveal
the
livid
countenance
of
their
occupant
;
while
the
vaulted
roof
rang
with
shriek
and
groan
<EOS>
so
horrible
and
heart
-
pierce
as
to
be
scarcely
endure
,
except
by
those
whose
nerve
be
firmly
strung
,
or
have
become
blunt
by
their
constant
recurrence
.
<EOS>
at
such
time
,
too
,
some
unhappy
creature
,
frenzy
by
agony
,
would
burst
from
his
couch
,
and
rend
the
air
with
his
cry
,
until
overtaken
and
overpower
by
his
attendant
.
<EOS>
on
one
occasion
,
it
happen
that
a
poor
wretch
,
who
have
be
thus
catch
,
break
loose
a
second
time
,
and
dart
through
a
door
lead
to
the
stone
staircase
in
the
northern
transept
gain
the
ambulatory
,
and
be
closely
follow
,
to
escape
his
pursuer
,
spring
through
one
of
the
arched
opening
,
and
fall
from
a
height
of
near
sixty
foot
,
be
dash
in
piece
on
the
flagged
floor
beneath
.
 
<EOS>
a
walk
through
this
mighty
lazar
-
house
would
have
furnish
a
wholesome
lesson
to
the
most
reckless
observer
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
contain
all
the
sick
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
and
yet
it
be
not
so
.
<EOS>
hundred
be
expire
in
their
own
dwelling
,
and
the
other
pest
-
house
continue
crowd
as
before
.
<EOS>
still
,
as
a
far
great
number
of
the
infect
be
here
congregate
,
and
could
be
see
at
one
view
,
the
picture
be
incomparably
more
impressive
.
<EOS>
every
part
of
the
cathedral
be
occupy
.
<EOS>
those
who
could
not
find
room
inside
it
crouch
beneath
the
column
of
the
portico
on
rug
or
blanket
,
and
implore
the
chirurgeon
as
they
pass
to
attend
them
.
<EOS>
want
of
room
also
drive
other
into
Saint
Faith
's
,
and
here
the
scene
be
,
if
possible
,
more
hideous
.
<EOS>
in
this
dismal
region
it
be
find
impossible
to
obtain
a
free
circulation
of
air
,
and
consequently
the
pestilential
effluvia
,
unable
to
escape
,
acquire
such
malignancy
,
that
it
be
almost
certain
destruction
to
inhale
it
.
<EOS>
after
a
time
,
few
of
the
nurse
and
attendant
would
venture
thither
;
and
to
take
a
patient
to
Saint
Faith
's
be
consider
tantamount
to
consign
him
to
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
whether
Judith
Malmayns
have
succeed
or
not
in
cure
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
,
it
be
not
our
present
purpose
to
relate
.
<EOS>
soon
after
the
cathedral
be
convert
into
a
lazar
-
house
she
return
thither
,
and
,
in
spite
of
the
opposition
of
Doctor
Hodges
,
be
appoint
one
of
the
nurse
.
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
suppose
that
her
appointment
be
the
result
of
any
ill
design
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
difficulty
of
obtain
attendance
,
that
little
choice
be
leave
,
and
the
nurse
be
all
of
questionable
character
<EOS>
,
it
be
suppose
she
be
only
a
shade
bad
than
her
fellow
,
while
she
be
know
to
be
active
and
courageous
.
<EOS>
and
this
be
speedily
prove
;
for
when
Saint
Faith
's
be
desert
by
the
other
,
she
remain
at
her
post
,
and
quit
it
neither
night
nor
day
.
<EOS>
a
large
pit
be
digge
in
the
open
space
at
the
north
-
east
corner
of
the
cathedral
,
and
to
this
great
number
of
body
be
nightly
convey
by
Chowles
and
Jonas
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
soon
fill
,
and
they
be
compel
to
resort
,
as
before
,
to
Finsbury
Fields
,
and
to
another
vast
pit
near
Aldgate
.
<EOS>
when
not
engage
in
this
revolt
employment
,
Chowles
take
up
his
quarter
in
the
crypt
,
where
,
in
spite
of
his
propinquity
to
the
sick
,
he
indulge
himself
in
his
customary
revelry
.
<EOS>
He
and
Judith
have
amass
,
in
one
way
or
other
,
a
vast
quantity
of
spoil
,
and
frequently
plan
how
they
would
spend
it
when
the
pestilence
cease
.
<EOS>
Their
treasure
be
carefully
conceal
in
a
cell
in
one
of
the
secret
passage
with
which
they
be
acquaint
,
lead
from
Saint
Faith
's
to
the
upper
structure
.
 
<EOS>
one
night
,
on
his
return
from
Finsbury
Fields
,
as
Chowles
be
seat
in
the
crypt
,
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
,
and
a
half
-
finished
flask
of
wine
before
him
,
he
be
startle
by
the
sudden
entrance
of
Judith
,
who
,
rush
up
to
him
,
seize
him
by
the
throat
,
and
almost
choke
him
before
he
could
extricate
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter?--would
you
strangle
me
,
you
murderous
harridan
?
"
he
cry
.
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
that
I
would
,
"
reply
Judith
,
prepare
to
renew
the
attack
.
 
<EOS>
"
stand
off
!
"
rejoin
Chowles
,
spring
back
,
and
snatch
up
a
spade
,
"
or
I
will
dash
out
your
brain
.
<EOS>
be
you
mad
?
"
<EOS>
he
continue
,
gaze
fearfully
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
angry
enough
to
make
me
so
,
"
she
reply
,
shake
her
clenched
fist
at
him
.
"
<EOS>
but
I
will
be
revenge
--
revenge

I
tell
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
revenge

"
<EOS>
cry
Chowles
,
in
astonishment--"for
what

<EOS>
what

I
do
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
well
to
affect
ignorance

"
rejoin
Judith
,
"
but
you
can
not
deceive
me

<EOS>
no

you
can
have
do
it

exclaim
Chowles

the

<EOS>
to
an
inexperienced
eye

however
,
she
would
have
appear
charming

<EOS>
nothing
could
exceed
the
delicacy
of
her
complexion

the
lovely
mould
of
her
feature

which
,
though
they
have
lose
much
of
their
fulness

have
gain

<EOS>
this
settle
,
Leonard
,
at
the
doctor
's
request
,
accompany
him
to
his
residence
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
scarcely
out
of
sight
,
when
a
man
,
who
have
be
conceal
behind
the
hutch
,
in
such
a
position
that
not
a
word
that
have
pass
escape
him
,
issue
from
his
hiding
-
place
,
and
dart
down
the
first
alley
on
the
right
,
make
the
good
of
his
way
to
Whitehall
.
 
<EOS>
up
to
this
time
,
Doctor
Hodges
have
not
judge
it
prudent
to
allow
a
meeting
between
Leonard
and
Nizza
Macascree
,
but
now
,
from
reason
of
his
own
,
he
resolve
no
longer
to
delay
it
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
on
reach
his
dwelling
,
he
take
the
apprentice
to
her
chamber
.
<EOS>
She
be
stand
in
a
pensive
attitude
,
near
a
window
which
look
towards
the
river
,
and
as
she
turn
on
his
entrance
,
Leonard
perceive
that
her
eye
be
fill
with
tear
.
<EOS>
blush
deeply
,
she
advance
towards
him
,
and
greet
him
with
all
the
warmth
of
her
affectionate
nature
.
<EOS>
She
have
quite
recover
her
good
look
,
and
Leonard
could
not
but
admit
that
,
have
he
see
her
before
his
heart
be
plight
to
another
,
it
must
have
be
give
to
her
.
<EOS>
comparison
be
ungracious
,
and
taste
differ
more
perhaps
as
to
beauty
than
on
any
other
point
;
but
if
Amabel
and
the
piper
's
daughter
have
be
place
together
,
it
would
not
have
be
difficult
to
determine
to
which
of
the
two
the
palm
of
superior
loveliness
should
be
assign
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
witchery
in
the
magnificent
black
eye
of
the
latter
--
in
her
exquisitely
-
form
mouth
and
pearly
tooth
--
in
her
clear
nut
-
brown
complexion
--
in
her
dusky
and
luxuriant
tress
,
and
in
her
light
elastic
figure
,
with
which
more
perfect
but
less
piquant
charm
could
not
compete
.
<EOS>
such
seem
to
be
the
opinion
of
Doctor
Hodges
,
for
as
he
gaze
at
her
with
unaffected
admiration
<EOS>
,
he
exclaim
,
as
if
to
himself--
<EOS>
"
I'faith
,
if
I
have
to
choose
between
the
two
,
I
know
which
it
would
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
exclamation
somewhat
disconcert
the
party
to
whom
it
refer
,
and
the
doctor
do
not
relieve
their
embarrassment
by
add
,
"
well
,
I
perceive
I
be
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
much
to
say
to
each
other
that
can
in
nowise
interest
me
.
<EOS>
excuse
me
a
moment
,
while
I
see
that
the
horse
be
order
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
and
disregard
Leonard
's
expostulating
look
,
he
hurry
out
of
the
room
,
and
shut
the
door
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
the
conversation
have
be
unrestrained
and
agreeable
on
both
side
,
but
now
they
be
leave
alone
together
,
neither
appear
able
to
utter
a
word
.
<EOS>
Nizza
cast
her
eye
timidly
on
the
ground
,
while
Leonard
caress
little
Bell
,
who
have
be
vainly
endeavour
by
her
gamesome
trick
to
win
his
attention
.
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
alas

<EOS>
I
pity
her
from
my
soul

"
<EOS>
reply
Nizza
,
in
a
tone
of
the
deep
commiseration
.
<EOS>
"
do
her
mother
go
with
her

"
 
<EOS>
"
no

Leonard

"
I

She
will
be

under
the
care
of
a
near
female
relative
at
Ashdown

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Would
it
not
be
better,--would
<EOS>
it
not
be
safe
,
if
she
be
in
the
precarious
state
you
describe
,
that
some
one
of
her
own
sex
should
accompany
her
?
"
say
Nizza
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
greatly
prefer
it

"
rejoin
Leonard

"
and
<EOS>
so
I
be
sure
would
amabel

<EOS>
but
where
be
such
a
person
to
be
find
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
with
you

will
watch
over

<EOS>
inquire
Leonard

somewhat
doubtfully

fully

Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
entirely
recover
,
and
able
to
undergo
far
more
fatigue
than
an
invalid
like
Amabel

<EOS>
"
It
will
relieve
me
from

world
of
anxiety
if
this
can
be
accomplish

rejoin
Leonard

<EOS>
"
I
will
consult
Doctor

"
I

Leonard
shall

It

about
two
hundred
yard
beyond
the
gate

on
the
right

near
the
old
doghouse

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
the
spot
perfectly
,

Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
recommend
you
to
put
on
a
mask
,
"
observe
the
doctor
to
Nizza
;
"
it
may
protect
you
from
molestation

<EOS>
I
will
find
you
one
below
.
"
 
<EOS>
lead
the
way
to
a
low
room

he
open
a
drawer
,
and
,
produce
a
small
loo
mask

give
it
her
.
<EOS>
the
youthful
pair
then
quit
the
house
,
Nizza
take
Bell
under
her
arm
,
as
she
intend
leave
her
with
her
father

<EOS>
the
necessity
of
the
doctor
's
caution
be
speedily
manifest
,
for
as
they
cross
Saint
Paul
's
churchyard
they
encounter
Pillichody
,
who
,
glance
inquisitively
at
Nizza
,
seem
disposed
to
push
his
inquiry
further
by
attempt
to
take
off
her
mask
;
but
the
fierce
look
of
the
apprentice
,
who
grasp
his
staff
in
a
menacing
manner
,
induce
him
to
abandon
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
follow
them
along
Cheapside
,
and
would
have
continue
the
pursuit
along
the
Old
Jewry
,
if
Leonard
have
not
come
to
a
halt
,
and
await
his
approach
.
<EOS>
He
then
take
to
his
heel
,
and
do
not
again
make
his
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
reach
the
open
field
and
slacken
their
pace
,
Leonard
deem
it
prudent
to
prepare
his
companion
for
her
interview
with
her
father
by
mention
the
circumstance
of
the
packet
,
and
the
important
secret
which
he
have
state

have
to
disclose
to
her

I
can
not

Nizza

"
<EOS>
She
die

I
believe
,
when
I
be
an
infant

<EOS>
at
all
event
,
I
never
remember
see
her
,
and
I
have
remark
that
my
father
be
averse
to
talk
about
her
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
now
question
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
reason

Judith
Malmayns

by
this
time

they
have
enter

narrow
footpath

across
the
field
in
the
direction
of

They

He

His

<EOS>
just
as
they
reach
it

they
hear
the
bell
ring

and
see
the

<EOS>
shrink
back
while

they
run
on
till
they
come
to
an
apothecary

shop

where
Leonard

describe
the
state

by
his
entreaty

establishment
and
one

<EOS>
leave
Nizza
in

<EOS>
Leonard
offer
the
purse
to
the
apothecary

but
the
latter
decline
it
,
and
desire
his
assistant
,
who
have
bring
a
barrow
with
him

to
place
the

pest

house

<EOS>
"
He
will

he
observe

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as

<EOS>
see
that
remonstrance
would
be
useless
,
Leonard
do
not
attempt
it
,
and
while
the
assistant

away
the

at

close

,

I

now
we

you

well

astir

daybreak

all

"
 
<EOS>
the
last
night
(
for
such
she
consider
it
)
spend
by
Amabel
in
her
father
's
dwelling
,
be
pass
in
the
kindly
interchange
of
affection
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
have
much
ado
to
maintain
his
firmness
,
and
ever
and
anon
,
in
spite
of
his
effort
,
his
labour
bosom
and
falter
tone
proclaim
the
struggle
within
.
<EOS>
He
sit
beside
his
daughter
,
with
her
thin
finger
clasp
in
his
,
and
speak
to
her
on
every
consolatory
topic
that
suggest
itself
.
<EOS>
this
discourse
,
however
,
insensibly
take
a
serious
turn
,
and
the
grocer
become
fully
convinced
that
his
daughter
be
not
merely
reconcile
to
the
early
death
that
to
all
appearance
await
her
,
but
wishful
for
it
.
<EOS>
He
find
,
too
,
to
his
inexpressible
grief
,
that
the
sense
of
the
Earl
of
Rochester
's
treachery
,
combine
with
her
own
indiscretion
,
and
the
consequence
that
may
have
attend
it
,
have
sink
deep
in
her
heart
,
and
produce
the
present
sad
result
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
it
will
scarcely
be
suppose
,
could
support
herself
so
well
as
her
husband
,
but
when
any
paroxysm
of
grief
approach
she
rush
out
of
the
room
,
and
give
vent
to
her
affliction
alone
.
<EOS>
all
the
rest
of
the
family
be
present
,
and
be
equally
distressed
.
<EOS>
but
what
most
strongly
affect
Amabel
be
a
simple
,
natural
remark
of
little
Christiana
,
who
,
fix
her
tearful
gaze
on
her
,
entreat
her
"
to
come
back
soon
.
"
 
<EOS>
Weak
as
she
be
,
Amabel
take
the
child
upon
her
knee
,
and
say
to
her
,
"
I
be
go
a
long
journey
,
Christiana
,
and
,
perhaps
may
never
come
back
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
attend
to
what
your
father
say
to
you
,
if
you
never
omit
,
morning
and
evening
,
to
implore
the
blessing
of
Heaven
,
we
shall
meet
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
understand
what
you
mean
,
sister
,
"
say
Christiana
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
place
you
be
go
to
be
the
grave
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
guess
rightly
,
Christiana
,
"
rejoin
Amabel
,
solemnly
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
forget
my
last
word
to
you
,
and
when
you
be
grow
into
a
woman
,
think
upon
the
poor
sister
who
love
you
tenderly
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
always
think
of
you
,
"
say
Christiana
,
clasp
her
arm
round
her
sister
's
neck
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
go
to
the
grave
instead
of
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
Amabel
press
her
to
her
bosom
,
and
in
a
broken
voice
murmur
a
blessing
over
her
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
here
think
it
necessary
to
interfere
,
and
,
take
the
weeping
child
in
his
arm
,
carry
her
into
the
adjoin
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
soon
after
this
,
the
household
be
summon
to
prayer
,
and
as
the
grocer
pour
forth
an
address
to
Heaven
for
the
preservation
of
his
daughter
,
all
earnestly
join
in
the
supplication
.
<EOS>
Their
devotion
end
,
Amabel
take
leave
of
her
brother
,
and
the
parting
may
have
be
painfully
prolong
but
for
the
interposition
of
her
father
.
<EOS>
the
last
and
severest
trial
be
at
hand
.
<EOS>
She
have
now
to
part
from
her
mother
,
from
whom
,
except
on
the
occasion
of
her
flight
with
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
she
have
never
yet
be
separate
.
<EOS>
She
have
now
to
part
with
her
,
in
all
probability
,
for
ever
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
heart
-
break
reflection
to
both
.
<EOS>
know
it
would
only
renew
their
affliction
,
and
perhaps
unfit
Amabel
for
the
journey
,
Mr.
Bloundel
have
prevail
upon
his
wife
not
to
see
her
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
the
moment
have
,
therefore
,
arrive
when
they
be
to
bid
each
other
farewell
.
<EOS>
the
anguish
display
in
his
wife
's
countenance
be
too
much
for
the
grocer
,
and
he
cover
his
face
with
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
hear
her
approach
Amabel
--
he
listen
to
their
mutual
sobs
--
to
their
last
embrace
.
<EOS>
It
be
succeed
by
a
stifled
cry
,
and
uncover
his
face
at
the
sound
,
he
spring
to
his
foot
just
in
time
to
receive
his
swooning
wife
in
his
arm

death

<EOS>
the

quick
pace
,
he
come
up
with
the
fugitive

just

<EOS>
Blaize

the
note

which
be
tie
with
a
piece
of
packthread

almost
illegible
character

<EOS>
"
do

Amabel
;
"
he

not

I
would

Patience
assure
me
the
contrary

"
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
Doctor
Hodges
have
come
up
,
and
an
explanation
ensue
.
<EOS>
It
be
agree
,
however
,
that
it
would
be
well
not
to
alarm
Mr.
Bloundel
,
but
to
attribute
the
porter
's
sudden
flight
to
mismanagement
of
his
steed
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
they
return
to
the
residence
of
the
grocer
,
who
be
anxiously
look
out
for
them
;
and
after
a
brief
delay

during
which
the
saddlebag
be

examine
and
secure
,
they
depart
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
look
wistfully
after
his
daughter
,
and
she
return
his
gaze
as
long
as
her
blind
eye
would
permit
her
.
<EOS>
so
unwonted
be
the
sound
of
horse
'
foot
at
this
period
,
that
many
a
melancholy
face
appear
at
the
window
to
gaze
at
them
as
they
ride
by
,
and
Nizza
Macascree
shudder
as
she
witness
the
envious
glance
cast
after
them
by
these
poor
captive
.
<EOS>
as
to
Blaize
,
when
they
get
into
Cheapside
,
he
be
so
terrified
by
the
dismal
evidence
of
the
pestilence
that
meet
him
at
every
turn
,
that
he
could
scarcely
keep
his
seat
,
and
it
be
not
until
he
have
drench
himself
and
his
companion
with
vinegar
,
and
stuff
his
mouth
with
myrrh
and
zedoary
,
that
he
feel
anything
like
composure
.
 
<EOS>
on
approach

Most

<EOS>
It

thither
on

day
of

to

<EOS>

<EOS>
the

on
one
side
of

near
which
stand
a

and
a

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
as

the
tramp
of
their
horse
be
mistake
for
the
dead

cart
,
and
a
door
be
suddenly
open
and
a
corpse
bring
forth
.
<EOS>
Leonard
would
have
avoid
the
spectacle
have
it
be
possible
,
but
they
be
now
too
close
to
Newgate
,
where
they
be
detain
for
a
few
minute
at
the
gate
,
while
their
bill
of
health
be
examine
and
countersign

<EOS>
during
this
pause
Leonard

at
the
grate
window
of
the
prison
,
the
debtor

side
of
which
front
the
street

<EOS>
but
not

<EOS>
in

as

already
be
state
,
the
prison

shut
up
.
 
<EOS>
the
gate
be
now
open
to
them
,
and
descend
Snow
Hill
<EOS>
they
enter
a
region
completely
devastate
by
the
pestilence
.
<EOS>
so
saddening
be
the
sight
,
that
Leonard
involuntarily
quicken
his
horse
's
pace
,
resolve
to
get
out
of
this
forlorn
district
as
speedily
as
possible
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
however
,
stop
by
an
unexpected
and
fearful
impediment
.
<EOS>
when
within
a
short
distance
of
Holborn
Bridge
,
he
observe
on
the
further
side
of
it
a
large
black
vehicle
,
and
,
unable
to
make
out
what
it
be
,
though
a
fearful
suspicion
cross
him
,
slacken
his
pace
.
<EOS>
a
near
approach
show
him
that
it
be
the
pest
-
cart
,
fill
with
its
charnel
load
.
<EOS>
the
horse
be
in
the
shaft
,
and
be
stand
quite
still

<EOS>
rise
in
his
stirrup
to
obtain
a
well
view
,
Leonard
perceive
that
the

at
a
little
distance
from
the
cart
,
in
an
attitude
that
proclaim
he
have
be
suddenly
seize
by
the
pestilence
,
and
have
probably
just
expire
.
 
<EOS>
not
choose
to
incur
the
risk
of
pass
this
contagious
load
,
Leonard
retrace
his
course
as
far
as
Holborn
Conduit
,
then
turn
into
Seacole

lane
,
and
make

cross

and
enter

<EOS>
He

when
he
encounter
a

<EOS>
though
much

Leonard
do
not
communicate
his
apprehension
to
his
companion

but
as
soon
as
the
guard
allow
him
to
pass
,
call
out
to
Blaize
to
follow
him
,
and
urge
his
horse
to
a
quick
pace
,
dash
up
drury

<EOS>
a
few
minute

hard

<EOS>
with
a
courage

devotion
that
redound

to
the
public
welfare
,
and
warmly
comment
upon
it
,
he
point
out
the
structure
to
Amabel
.
<EOS>
but
the
speed
at
which
she
be
bear
along
do
not
allow
her
time
to
bestow
more
than
a
hasty
glance
at
it
.
<EOS>
on

while
Leonard
be

whether

plant
himself
in
the
direct
course
of
their
pursuer

and
he
involuntarily
draw
in
the
rein
to
see
what
would
ensue
.
<EOS>
in
another
moment
,
the
horseman
,
who

and
whom
Leonard

and
threaten
to

She

a
small
scarlet
patch
on

waist
so
as
to
hold
her
on

for
she

he
add
to
Leonard
;
"

a
short
distance
up
the
road
.
"
 
<EOS>
thank
him
for
the
information
,
Leonard
take
the
course
indicate
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
proceed
far
,
when
he
be
alarm
by
hear
a
piteous
cry
of
"
stop
!
<EOS>
stop
!
"
<EOS>
proceed
from
Blaize
;
and
,
halt
,
find
that
the
porter
have
be
so
greatly
terrified
by
the
watchman
's
account
of
the
frightful
mortality
in
the
poor
innkeeper
's
family
,
that
he
have
apply
to
his
phial
of
plague

water
,
and
in
pull

his
box
of
rufuse
,
and
the
jar
of
anti

pestilential
confection
.
<EOS>
He
have
just
ascertain
his
loss
,
and
wish
to
go
back
,
but
this
Nizza
Macascree
would
not
permit
.
<EOS>
enrage
at
the
delay
,
Leonard
peremptorily
order
the
porter
to
come
on
;
and
Blaize
,
cast
a
rueful
glance
at
his
treasure
,
which
he
perceive
at
a
little
distance
in
the
middle
of
the
road
,
be
compel
to
obey
.
 
<EOS>
at
Paddington
,
another
disappointment
await
them
.
<EOS>
the
Wheatsheaf
be
occupy
by
two
large
family
,
who
be
fly
from
the
infected
city
,
and
no
accommodation
could
be
obtain
.
<EOS>
Leonard
look
wistfully
at
Nizza
Macascree
,
as
if
to
ascertain
what
to
do
,
and
she
be
equally
perplex
;
but
the
difficulty
be
relieve
by
Amabel
herself
,
who
say
she
feel
much
well
,
and
able
to
proceed
a
little
further
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
return
to
London
,
"
she
continue
with
great
earnestness
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
die
on
the
road
than
go
home
again
.
<EOS>
some
cottage
will
receive
us
.
<EOS>
if
not
,
I
can
rest
for
a
short
time
in
the
field
.
"
 
<EOS>
think
it
good
to
comply
,
Leonard
proceed
along
the
Harrow
-
road
.
<EOS>
soon
after
cross
Paddington
Green
,
he
overtake
a
little
train
of
fugitive
drive
a
cart
fill
with
child
,
and
laden
with
luggage
.
<EOS>
further
on
,
as
he
survey
the
beautiful
meadow
,
stretch
out
on
either
side
of
him
,
he
perceive
a
line
of
small
tent
,
resemble
a
gipsy
encampment
,
pitch
at
a
certain
distance
from
each
other
,
and
evidently
occupy
by
family
who
have
flee
from
their
home
from
fear
of
infection
.
<EOS>
this
give
a
singular
character
to
the
prospect
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
other
and
far
more
painful
sight
on
the
road
,
which
could
not
fail
to
attract
attention
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
half
-
mile
,
almost
at
every
hundred
yard
may
be
see
some
sick
man
,
who
,
unable
to
proceed
further
,
have
fall
against
the
hedge
-
side
,
and
exhibit
his
sore
to
move
the
pity
of
the
passer
-
by
.
<EOS>
but
these
supplication
be
wholly
unheeded
.
<EOS>
self
-
preservation
be
the
first
object
with
all
,
and
the
traveller
hold
handkerchief
steep
in
vinegar
to
their
face
,
and
avert
their
head
,
pass
by
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
the
pestilence
,
it
may
be
remark
,
have
visit
with
extraordinary
rigour
the
whole
of
the
high
country
at
the

<EOS>
the

and
,
at
other
season
,
healthful

of
Hampstead
and
Highgate

suffer
severely
from
the
scourge
;
and
it
even
extend
its
ravage
as
far
as
Harrow
-
on
-
the
-
Hill
,
which
it
half
depopulate
.
<EOS>
this
will
account
for
the
circumstance
of
a
large
pest
-
house
be
erect
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Westbourne
Green
,
which
the
party
now
approach

<EOS>
two

see
cross
the
field
in
the
direction
of
the
hospital
,
and
this
circumstance
call
Leonard
's
attention
to
it
.
<EOS>
shudderingly
avert
his
gaze
,
he
quicken
his
pace
,
and
soon
reach
a
small
farmhouse
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
rise
from
Kensal

.
<EOS>
determine
to
seek
a
temporary

here
for

,
he
open

,
and
,
ride
into

,
fortunately
meet
with
owner
of
the
house
,
a
worthy
farmer
,
name
Wingfield
,
to
whom
he
explain
her
situation
.
<EOS>
the
man
at
first
hesitate
,
but
,
on
receive
Leonard
's
solemn
assurance
that
she
be
free
from
the
plague
,
consent
to
receive
the
whole
party
.
 
<EOS>
assist
Amabel
to
dismount
<EOS>
,
Wingfield
convey
her
in
his
arm
into
the
house
,
and
deliver
her
to
his
wife
,
bid
her
take
care
of

<EOS>
the
injunction
be
scarcely

<EOS>
the

and
then

but
with
much

,
to
her

,
"

<EOS>

"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
return
to
the

.
<EOS>
meantime
,
the
other

dismount
,
and
Wingfield
,
bidding
Nizza

,
lead
the

to
the

and
place
cold

and
a
jug
of
ale
before

an
injunction
which
Blaize
,
notwithstanding
his
previous
repast
of
roast

,
very
readily
comply
with
.
<EOS>
while
they
be
thus
employ
,
Dame

make
her
appearance
.
<EOS>
She
say
that
the
poor
creature
(
mean
Amabel
)
be
too
ill
to
proceed
on
her
journey
that
day
,
and
beg
her
husband
to
allow
her
to
stop
till
the
next
morning
,
when
she
hope
she
would
be
able
to

<EOS>
"

"
<EOS>
cry
Wingfield
;
"
she

if
you
desire
it
,
or
she

<EOS>
go

"
 
<EOS>
and
as
his
wife
withdraw
,
well
pleased
at
have
obtain
her
request
,
Wingfield
address
himself
to
Leonard
,
and
inquire

and
as

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
"
She

<EOS>
"
My

<EOS>
She

but
her
seducer
be
one
of
the
chief
favourite
of
our
profligate
monarch

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do

the
Earl
of
Rochester

"
cry
Leonard

<EOS>
"

reply
the
farmer
,
whose

a
stern
expression
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the

<EOS>
He

"
 
<EOS>
"
Gracious
Heaven
!
<EOS>
"
exclaim
Leonard
,
in
astonishment
;
"
what
a
strange
coincidence
be
this
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
he
then
proceed
to
relate
to
Wingfield
the
persecution
which
Nizza
Macascree
have
endure
from
the
profligate
knight
the
farmer
listen
to
his
recital
with
breathless
interest
,
and
when
it
be
end
arise
,
and
,
take
a
hasty
turn
round
the
room
,
halt
at
the
table
and
strike
it
forcibly
with
his
clenched
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
that
man
will
never
cross
my
path
,
"
he
say
,
all
the
blood
mount
to
his
face
,
and
his
eye
kindle
with
fury
.
<EOS>
"
as
God
shall
judge
me
,
I
will
kill
him
if
I
meet
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
I
hope
you
never
will
meet
him
,
"
observe
Leonard
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
injure
you
enough
already
,
without
put
you
out
of
the
pale
of
divine
mercy
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
these
rascal
have
do
us
all
an
injury
,
"
observe
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
patience
have
never
be
like
herself
since
Major
Pillichody
enter
my
master
's
dwelling
,
and
make
love
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
feel
quite
uneasy
to
think
how
the
little
hussy
will
go
on
during
my
absence
.
<EOS>
She
can
not
get
out
of
the
house
,
that
be
one
comfort
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
mention
another
wretch
,
who
be
constantly
with
Sir
Paul
,
"
cry
Wingfield
.
"
<EOS>
perdition
seize
them
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
perdition
seize
them
!
"
echo
Blaize
,
strike
the
table
in
his
turn--"especially
Major
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
ever
suspect
Sir
Paul
to
be
of
high
rank
than
he
pretend
?
"
ask
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
rejoin
wingfield
;
"
what
motive
have
you
for
the
question
?
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
then
tell
him
of
the
inquiry
institute
by
Doctor
Hodges
relative
to
Nizza
's
retreat
,
and
how
they
have
be
baffle
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
strange
,
"
he
continue
,
"
that
Nizza
herself
never
hear
the
real
name
of
her
persecutor
;
neither
can
she
tell
where
the
house
to
which
she
be
convey
,
when
in
a
faint
condition
,
and
from
which
she
be
remove
when
attack
with
the
plague
,
be
situate
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
strange
indeed
,
"
observe
the
farmer
,
musingly
.
 
<EOS>
soon
after
this
,
Nizza
Macascree
make
her
appearance
,
and
inform
them
that
Amabel
have
fall
into
a
tranquil
slumber
,
which
,
in
all
probability
,
would
completely
renovate
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
will
,
"
say
Wingfield
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
shall
not
part
with
her
to
-
day
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
enter
into
conversation
with
Nizza
,
and
after
a
little
time
,
propose
to
her
and
Leonard
to
walk
across
the
field
with
him
to
Willesden
,
to
visit
his
daughter
's
grave
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
wife
will
take
charge
of
Amabel
,
"
he
say
;
"
you
may
safely
trust
her
in
her
hand
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
could
raise
no
objection
,
except
the
possibility
that
the
Earl
of
Rochester
and
his
companion
may
discover
their
retreat
,
and
carry
off
Amabel
in
his
absence
;
but
,
after
a
little
reflection
,
consider
this
altogether
unlikely
,
he
assent
,
and
they
set
out
.
<EOS>
a
pleasant
walk
across
the
field
bring
them
to
the
pretty
little
village
of
Willesden
and
its
old
and
beautiful
church
.
<EOS>
They
proceed
to
the
grave
of
poor
Sarah
Wingfield
,
which
lie
at
the
east
of
the
church
,
beneath
one
of
the
tall
elm
,
and
Nizza
,
as
she
stand
by
the
rounded
sod
cover
the
remain
of
the
unfortunate
girl
,
could
not
restrain
her
tear
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
may
have
be
my
own
fate
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
what
an
escape
I
have
have
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
bring
you
here
to
read
you
a
lesson
,
"
say
Wingfield
,
in
a
tone
of
deep
emotion
,
"
but
because
you
,
who
know
the
temptation
to
which
the
poor
creature
who
lie
there
be
expose
,
will
pity
her
.
<EOS>
not
alone
do
remorse
for
her
conduct
prey
upon
her
spirit
--
not
alone
<EOS>
do
she
suffer
from
self
-
<EOS>
reproach,--but
<EOS>
the
scoff
and
jeer
of
her
sex
,
who
never
forgive
an
err
sister
,
break
her
heart
.
<EOS>
She
be
now
,
however
,
beyond
the
reach
of
human
malice
,
and
,
I
trust
,
at
peace
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
he
say
this
,
he
walk
away
to
hide
his
emotion
,
and
presently
afterwards
rejoin
them
,
they
quit
the
churchyard
together
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
recrosse
the
field
,
Wingfield
observe
two
man
dig
a
hole
in
the
ground
,
and
,
guess
their
object
,
pause
for
a
few
minute
to
watch
them
.
<EOS>
have
throw
out
the
earth
to
the
depth
of
a
couple
of
foot
,
one
of
them
take
a
long
hook
pole
,
and
attach
it
to
the
body
of
a
victim
to
the
pestilence
,
who
have
wander
into
the
field
and
die
there
,
drag
it
towards
the
pit
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
corpse
be
push
into
its
narrow
receptacle
,
the
clay
be
shovel
over
it
,
and
trodden
down
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
sad
mode
of
burial
for
a
Christian
,
"
observe
Wingfield
.
<EOS>
"
but
it
would
not
do
to
leave
an
infected
body
to
rot
in
the
field
,
and
spread
the
contagion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
such
a
grave
be
well
than
the
plague
-
pit
,
"
rejoin
Leonard
,
recall
the
frightful
scene
he
have
witness
there
.
 
<EOS>
on
reach
Wingfield
's
dwelling
,
they
find
from
the
good
dame
,
that
Amabel
have
awaken
from
her
slumber
greatly
refresh
;
but
she
give
it
as
her
opinion
that
she
have
better
remain
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
no
one
go
into
the
room
to
her
except
Nizza
Macascree
.
<EOS>
a
substantial
dinner
be
provide
for
his
guest
by
the
hospitable
farmer
;
and
Blaize
,
who
have
be
for
some
time
confine
to
salt
provision
at
his
master
's
house
,
do
ample
justice
to
the
fresh
meat
and
vegetable
.
 
<EOS>
the
meal
over
,
Leonard
,
who
feel
exceedingly
curious
to
learn
what
have
become
of
the
mysterious
stranger
whose
child
he
have
carry
to
the
plague
-
pit
,
and
who
have
appear
so
strangely
interested
in
Nizza
Macascree
,
determine
to
walk
to
the
pest
-
house
in
Finsbury
Fields
and
inquire
after
him
.
<EOS>
on
communicate
his
intention
to
his
host
,
Wingfield
would
have
dissuade
him
;
but
as
Leonard
affirm
he
have
no
fear
of
infection
,
he
desist
from
the
attempt
.

I

a
great
curiosity
to
see
a
pest

house

and
should
like
to
go
with
you

if
you
will
let
me

"
 
<EOS>
the
apprentice
stare
at
him
in
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
never
dare
to
enter
it
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
wherever
you

"
reply
the
porter
,
with
a
confidence
mainly
inspire
by
the
hospitable
farmer
's
strong
ale
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
,
"
reply
Leonard

<EOS>
"
I
shall
keep
you
to
your
word

"
 
<EOS>
in
less
than
an
hour
they
reach
marylebone
field
(
now
the
Regent

Park
)
,
and
,
cross
them
,
enter
a
lane
,

in
pretty
nearly
the
same
direction
as
the
present
New

<EOS>
It
Drought

to
Clerkenwell
,
whence
they
proceed
to
Finsbury
Fields
,
and
soon
come
in
sight
of
the
pest
-
house
.
<EOS>
when
Blaize
find
himself
so
near
this
dread
asylum
,
all
his
courage
vanish
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
certainly
enter
the
pest
-
house
with
you
,
"
he
say
to
Leonard
,
"
but
I
have
use
up
all
my
vinegar
,
and
you
know
I
lose
my
box
of
rufuse
and
the
pot
of
anti
-
pestilential
confection
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
excuse
shall
not
serve
your
turn
,
"
reply
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
get
plenty
of
vinegar
and
plague
medicine
in
the
pest
-
house
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
have
no
money
to
pay
for
them
,
"
rejoin
Blaize
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
lend
you
some

"
say
Leonard
,
place
a
few
piece
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
now
,
come
along
.
"
 
<EOS>
Blaize
would
fain
have
run
away
,
but
,
afraid
of
incur
the
apprentice
's
anger
,
he
walk
tremblingly
after
him
.
<EOS>
They
enter
the
garden
-
gate
,
and
soon
reach
the
principal
door
,
which
,
as
usual
,
stand
open
.
<EOS>
scarcely
able
to
support
himself
,
the
porter
totter
into
the
large
room
;
but
as
he
cast
his
eye
around
,
and
beheld
the
miserable
occupant
of
the
pallet
,
and
hear
their
cry
and
groan
,
he
be
so
scared
that
he
could
not
move
another
step
,
but
stand
like
one
transfix
with
terror
.
<EOS>
pay
little
attention
to
him
,
Leonard
walk
forward
,
and
at
the
further
extremity
of
the
chamber
find
the
young
chirurgeon
whom
he
have
formerly
see
,
and
describe
the
stranger
,
inquire
where
he
be
place
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
person
you
allude
to
have
be
remove
,
"
return
the
chirurgeon
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Doctor
Hodges
visit
him
this
morning
,
and
have
him
convey
to
his
own
dwelling
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
he
sensible
at
the
time
?
"
ask
the
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
"
reply
the
chirurgeon
;
"
but
the
doctor
appear
to
recognise
in
him
an
old
friend
,
though
I
do
not
hear
him
mention
his
name
;
and
it
be
on
that
account
,
I
conclude
,
that
he
have
him
remove
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
he
likely
to
recover
?
"
ask
Leonard
,
whose
curiosity
be
arouse
by
what
he
hear
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
impossible
to
say
,
"
reply
the
young
man
.
"
<EOS>
but
he
can
not
be
in
well
hand
than
those
of
Doctor
Hodges
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
perfectly
concur
with
him
,
and
,
after
a
few
minute
'
further
conversation
,
turn
to
depart
.
<EOS>
not
see
Blaize
,
he
conclude
he
have
go
forth
,
and
expect
to
find
him
in
the
garden
,
or
,
at
all
event
,
in
the
field
adjoin
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
nowhere
to
be
see
.
<EOS>
while
wonder
what
have
become
of
him
,
Leonard
hear
a
loud
cry
,
in
the
voice
of
the
porter
,
issue
from
the
barn
,
which
,
as
have
already
be
state
,
have
be
convert
into
a
receptacle
for
the
sick
;
and
hurry
thither
,
he
find
Blaize
in
the
hand
of
two
stout
assistant
,
who
have
strip
him
of
his
clothe
,
and
be
tie
him
down
to
a
pallet
.
<EOS>
on
see
Leonard
,
Blaize
implore
him
to
deliver
him
from
the
hand
of
his
persecutor
;
and
the
apprentice
assure
the
assistant
that
the
poor
fellow
be
perfectly
free
from
infection
,
they
liberate
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
appear
,
on
inquiry
,
that
Blaize
have
fall
against
one
of
the
pallet
in
a
state
almost
of
insensibility
,
and
the
two
assistant
,
chance
to
pass
at
the
time
,
and
take
him
for
a
plague
patient
,
have
convey
him
to
the
barn
.
<EOS>
on
reach
it
,
he
recover
,
and
besought
them
to
set
him
free
,
but
they
pay
no
attention
to
his
cry
,
and
proceed
to
strip
him
,
and
bind
him
to
the
bed
,
as
before
relate
.
 
<EOS>
thus
release
,
the
porter
lose
no
time
in
dress
himself
;
and
Leonard
,
to
allay
his
terror
,
have
a
strong
dose
of
anti
-
pestilential
elixir
administer
to
him
.
<EOS>
after
which
,
have
procure
him
a
box
of
rufuse
,
and
a
phial
of
plague
-
water
,
Blaize
shake
off
his
apprehension
,
and
they
set
out
at
a
brisk
pace
for
Kensal
Green
.
  
<EOS>
VII
.
 
<EOS>
the
JOURNEY
.
 
<EOS>
Blaize
be
destine
to
experience
a
second
fright
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
mention
that
the
infect
be
sometimes
seize
with
a
rabid
desire
of
communicate
the
disorder
to
such
as
have
not
be
attack
by
it
;
and
as
the
pair
be
make
the
good
of
their
way
along
the
Harrow
-
road
,
a
poor
lazar
who
be
lie
against
the
hedge
-
side
,
and
have
vainly
implore
their
assistance
,
suddenly
start
up
,
and
with
furious
cry
and
gesture
make
towards
the
porter
.
<EOS>
guess
his
intention
,
Blaize
take
to
his
heel
,
and
,
fold
himself
closely
pressed
,
break
through
the
hedge
on
the
right
,
and
speed
across
the
field
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
the
alarming
nature
of
the
occurrence
,
the
apprentice
could
not
help
laugh
at
the
unwonted
agility
display
by
the
fat
little
porter
,
who
run
so
swiftly
that
it
appear
probable
he
would
distance
his
pursuer
.
<EOS>
to
prevent
mischief
,
however
,
Leonard
set
off
after
him
,
and
be
fast
gain
upon
the
lazar
,
whose
strength
be
evidently
fail
,
when
the
poor
wretch
utter
a
loud
cry
,
and
fall
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
on
come
up
,
Leonard
find
him
lie
with
his
face
in
the
grass
,
and
convulse
by
the
agony
of
death
,
and
perceive
that
all
be
over
,
hurry
after
the
porter
,
whom
he
find
seat
on
a
gate
,
at
the
further
end
of
the
field
,
solace
himself
with
a
draught
of
plague
-
water
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Leonard
!
<EOS>
"
groan
the
latter
,
"
how
little
do
we
know
what
be
for
our
good
!
<EOS>
I
be
delighted
to
quit
my
master
's
house
this
morning
,
but
I
now
wish
with
,
all
my
heart
<EOS>
I
be
back
again
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
I
shall
die
of
the
plague
after
all
.
<EOS>
pray
what
be
the
first
symptom
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
pooh
!
<EOS>
pooh
!
<EOS>
do
not
think
about
it
,
and
you
will
take
no
harm
,
"
rejoin
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
Put
by
your
phial
,
and
let
us
make
the
good
of
our
way
to
Farmer
Wingfield
's
dwelling
.
"
 
<EOS>
be
now
in
sight
of
the
farm
,
which
,
from
its
elevated
situation
,
could
be
distinguish
at
a
distance
of
two
mile
in
this
direction
,
they
easily
shape
their
course
towards
it
across
the
field
.
<EOS>
when
about
halfway
up
the
hill
,
Leonard
pause
to
look
behind
him
.
<EOS>
the
view
be
exquisite
,
and
it
be
precisely
the
hour
(
just
before
sunset
)
at
which
it
could
be
see
to
the
great
advantage
.
<EOS>
on
the
right
,
his
gaze
wander
to
the
beautiful
and
well
-
woode
height
of
Richmond
and
Wimbledon
,
beyond
which
he
could
trace
the
long
line
of
the
Surrey
hill
,
while
nearer
he
perceive
Notting
Hill
,
now
cover
with
habitation
,
but
then
a
verdant
knoll
,
crown
by
a
few
tree
,
but
without
so
much
as
a
cottage
upon
it
.
<EOS>
on
the
left
stand
Hampstead
;
at
that
time
a
collection
of
pretty
cottage
,
but
want
its
present
chief
ornament
,
the
church
.
<EOS>
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
rich
meadow
,
border
with
fine
hedge
,
intersperse
with
well
-
grow
timber
,
spread
out
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
.
<EOS>
nothing
destroy
the
rural
character
of
the
prospect
;
nor
be
there
any
indication
of
the
neighbourhood
of
a
great
city
,
except
the
lofty
tower
and
massive
body
of
Saint
Paul
's
,
which
appear
above
the
top
of
the
intervene
tree
in
the
distance
.
 
<EOS>
as
on
former
occasion
,
when
contemplate
the
surround
country
from
the
summit
of
the
cathedral
,
Leonard
could
not
help
contrast
the
beauty
of
the
scene
before
him
with
the
horrible
scourge
by
which
it
be
ravage
.
<EOS>
never
have
the
country
look
so
beautiful
--
never
,
therefore
,
be
the
contrast
so
forcible
;
and
it
appear
to
him
like
a
lovely
mask
hide
the
hideous
and
ghastly
feature
of
death
.
<EOS>
tinge
by
the
sombre
hue
of
his
thought
,
the
whole
scene
change
its
complexion
.
<EOS>
the
smile
landscape
seem
to
darken
,
and
the
cool
air
of
evening
to
become
hot
and
noisome
,
as
if
laden
with
the
deadly
exhalation
of
the
pestilence
.
<EOS>
nor
do
the
working
of
his
imagination
stop
here
.
<EOS>
He
fancy
even
at
this
distance
--
nearly
seven
mile
--
that
he
could
discern
Solomon
Eagle
on
the
summit
of
Saint
Paul
's
.
<EOS>
at
first
the
figure
look
like
a
small
black
speck
;
but
it
gradually
dilate
,
until
it
become
twice
the
size
of
the
cathedral
,
upon
the
central
tower
of
which
its
foot
rest
,
while
its
arm
be
spread
abroad
over
the
city
.
<EOS>
in
its
right
hand
the
gigantic
figure
hold
a
blaze
torch
,
and
in
the
left
a
phial
,
from
the
mouth
of
which
a
stream
of
dark
liquid
descend
.
<EOS>
so
vividly
do
this
phantasm
present
itself
to
Leonard
,
that
,
almost
convinced
of
its
reality
,
he
place
his
hand
before
his
eye
for
a
few
moment
,
and
,
on
withdraw
them
,
be
glad
to
find
that
the
delusion
be
occasion
by
a
black
cloud
over
the
cathedral
,
which
his
distemper
fancy
have
convert
into
the
colossal
figure
of
the
enthusiast
.
 
<EOS>
Blaize
,
who
have
take
the
opportunity
of
his
companion
's
abstraction
to
sip
a
little
more
plague
-
water
,
now
approach
,
and
tell
him
that
Wingfield
be
descend
the
hill
to
meet
them
.
<EOS>
rouse
himself
,
Leonard
run
towards
the
farmer
,
who
appear
delighted
to
see
them
back
again
,
and
conduct
them
to
his
dwelling
.
<EOS>
owe
to
the
tender
and
truly
maternal
attention
of
Dame
Wingfield
,
Amabel
be
so
much
well
that
she
be
able
to
join
the
party
at
supper
,
though
she
take
no
share
in
the
meal
.
<EOS>
Wingfield
listen
to
the
soft
tone
of
her
voice
as
she
converse
with
his
wife
,
and
at
last
,
unable
to
control
his
emotion
,
lay
down
his
knife
and
fork
,
and
quit
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
with
your
husband
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
Amabel
of
her
hostess
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
be
not
unwell
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
no
,
"
reply
the
good
dame
;
"
your
voice
remind
him
of
our
daughter
,
whose
history
I
have
relate
to
you
--
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
alas
!
"
exclaim
Amabel
,
with
a
sympathize
look
,
"
I
will
be
silent
,
if
it
pain
him
to
hear
me
speak
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
on
no
account
,
"
rejoin
Dame
Wingfield
.
<EOS>
"
the
tear
he
have
shed
will
relieve
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
weep
when
poor
Sarah
die
,
and
I
fear
his
heart
would
break
.
<EOS>
talk
to
him
as
you
have
talk
to
me
,
and
you
will
do
him
a
world
of
good
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
shortly
afterwards
,
the
farmer
return
to
the
table
,
and
the
meal
proceed
to
its
close
without
further
interruption
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
board
be
clear
,
Wingfield
take
a
chair
by
Amabel
,
who
,
in
compliance
with
his
wife
's
request
,
speak
to
him
about
his
daughter
,
and
in
term
calculate
to
afford
him
consolation
.
<EOS>
Leonard
be
enrapture
by
her
discourse
,
and
put
so
little
constraint
upon
his
admiration
,
that
Nizza
Macascree
could
not
repress
a
pang
of
jealousy
.
<EOS>
as
to
Blaize
,
who
have
eat
as
much
as
he
could
cram
,
and
empty
a
large
jug
of
the
farmer
's
stout
ale
,
he
take
his
chair
to
a
corner
,
and
speedily
fall
asleep
;
his
hoarse
but
tranquil
breathe
prove
that
the
alarm
he
have
undergo
during
the
day
do
not
haunt
his
slumber
.
<EOS>
before
separate
for
the
night
,
Amabel
entreat
that
prayer
may
be
say
,
and
her
request
be
readily
grant
,
she
be
about
to
retire
with
Nizza
,
when
Wingfield
detain
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
think
that
I
may
offer
you
a
safe
asylum
here
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
like
it
,
you
shall
remain
with
us
till
your
health
be
fully
reinstate

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
most
kindly
for
the
offer
,
"
return
Amabel
,
gratefully
;
"
and
if
I
do
not
accept
it
,
it
be
neither
because
I
should
not
esteem
myself
safe
here

nor
because
I
be
unwilling
to
be
indebted
to
your
hospitality
,
but
that
I
have
be
specially
advise
,
as
my
last
chance
of
recovery
,
to
try
the
air
of
Berkshire

<EOS>
I
have
little

myself

I
owe
it
to
those
who
love
me
to
make
the
experiment

<EOS>
"
if
such
be
the

"
return
the
farmer
,
"
I
will
not

my

Dame
Wingfield
warmly

<EOS>
Its
chief
interest
,
however

must

derive
from
its

Her

pleasing

some

She

painfully
affect
her

nor

concerned
at

precarious

<EOS>
for
the
first
day

two
after
their

Amabel
suffer
greatly
from
the
effect
of
the
journey

but
after
that
time

she
gain
strength
so
rapidly
,
that
Mrs.

who
at
first
have
well
-
nigh
despair
of
her
recovery
,
begin
to
indulge
a
hope

<EOS>
the
gentle
sufferer
would
sit
throughout

inhale

Doctor

Mrs.

"
and
hold
it
a
certain
sign
of
your
speedy
restoration

<EOS>
before

I

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
too
sanguine
<EOS>
,
I
fear
,
dear
aunt

"
rejoin
Amabel
,
"
but
the
change
that
have
take
place
in
my
feeling
,
may
operate
beneficially
upon
my
constitution
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no

it

my

"
reply
Mrs.
Buscot
;
"
no

"
 
<EOS>
the
good
dame
feel
a
strong
inclination
at
this
moment
to
introduce
a
subject
very
near
her
heart
,
but
,
feel
doubtful
as
to
its
reception
,
she
check
herself
.
<EOS>
the
devoted
attachment
of
the
apprentice
to
her
niece
have
entirely
win
her
regard
,
and
she
fondly
hope
she
would
be
able
to
wean
Amabel
from
all
thought
of
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
and
induce
her
to
give
her
hand
to
her
faithful
lover
.
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
she
often
speak
to
her
of
Leonard
--
of
his
devotion
and
constancy
,
his
good
look
and
excellent
quality
;
and
though
Amabel
assent
to
all
she
say
,
Mrs.
Buscot
be
sorry
to
perceive
that
the
impression
she
desire
be
not
produce
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
so
with
Nizza
Macascree
.
<EOS>
whenever
Leonard
's
name
be
mention
,
her
eye
sparkle
,
her
cheek
glow
,
and
she
respond
so
warmly
to
all
that
be
say
in
his
praise
,
that
Mrs.
Buscot
soon
find
out
the
state
of
her
heart
.
<EOS>
the
discovery
occasion
her
some
little
disquietude
,
for
the
worthy
creature
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
make
even
her
niece
happy
at
the
expense
of
another
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
object
of
all
this
tender
interest
,
he
feel
far
happy
than
he
have
do
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
He
see
Amabel
every
day
,
and
note
with
unspeakable
delight
the
gradual
improvement
which
appear
to
be
take
place
in
her
health
.
<EOS>
the
great
part
of
his
time
,
however
,
be
not
pass
in
her
society
,
but
in
thread
the
intricacy
of
the
wood
,
or
in
ramble
over
the
neighbour
down
;
and
he
not
only
derive
pleasure
from
these
ramble
,
but
his
health
and
spirit
,
which
have
be
not
a
little
shake
by
the
awful
scene
he
have
recently
witness
,
be
materially
improve
.
<EOS>
here
,
at
last
,
he
seem
to
have
get
rid
of
the
grim
spectre
which
,
for
two
month
,
have
constantly
haunt
him
.
<EOS>
no
great
contrast
can
be
conceive
than
his
present
quiet
life
offer
to
the
fearful
excitement
he
have
recently
undergo
.
<EOS>
for
hot
and
narrow
thoroughfare
reek
with
pestilential
effluvium
,
resound
with
frightful
shriek
,
or
piteous
cry
,
and
bear
on
every
side
mark
of
the
destructive
progress
of
the
scourge
--
for
these
terrible
sight
and
sound
--
for
the
charnel
horror
of
the
plague
-
pit
--
the
scarcely
less
revolt
scene
at
the
pest
-
house
--
<EOS>
the
dismal
bell
announce
the
dead
-
cart
--
the
doleful
cry
of
the
burier
--
for
grave
surfeit
with
corruption
,
and
street
fill
with
the
dying
and
the
dead
--
and
,
above
all
,
for
the
ever
-
haunt
expectation
that
a
like
fate
may
be
his
own,--he
have
exchange
green
hill
,
fresh
breeze
,
spread
view
,
the
song
of
the
lark
,
and
a
thousand
other
delight
,
and
assurance
of
health
and
contentment
.
<EOS>
often
,
as
he
gaze
from
the
ridge
of
the
down
into
the
wide
-
spread
vale
beneath
,
he
wonder
whether
the
destroy
angel
have
smite
any
of
its
peaceful
habitation
,
and
breathe
a
prayer
for
their
preservation
!
 
<EOS>
but
the
satisfaction
he
derive
from
have
quit
the
infect
city
be
trifle
compare
with
that
of
Blaize
,
whose
sole
anxiety
be
lest
he
should
be
send
back
to
London
.
<EOS>
seldom
stray
further
than
the
gate
of
the
mansion
,
though
often
invite
by
John
Lutcombe
to
accompany
him
to
some
of
the
neighbouring
village
;
have
little
to
do
,
and
less
to
think
of
,
unless
to
calculate
how
much
he
could
consume
at
the
next
<EOS>
meal,--for
he
have
banish
all
idea
of
the
plague,--he
conceive
himself
at
the
summit
of
happiness
,
and
wax
so
sleek
and
round
,
that
his
face
shine
like
a
full
moon
,
while
his
doublet
would
scarcely
meet
around
his
waist
.
 
<EOS>
one
day
,
about
a
fortnight
after
their
arrival
,
and
when
thing
be
in
this
happy
state
,
Amabel

gallery
at

,
observe
a
troop
of
horseman
,
very
gallantly
equip
,
appear
at
the
further
end
of
the
northern
avenue
.
<EOS>
an
inexpressible
terror
seize
her
,
and
she
would
have
flee
into
the
house
,
but
her
limb
refuse
their
office
.
 
<EOS>
"
look
there

"
<EOS>
she
cry
to
Nizza

at
that
moment

she

to
the

the

out

hither

off

<EOS>
"
You

Nizza

express
a
hopefulness

the

descend
a
short

they
enter
Amabel

chamber
,

fasten
the
door

It

they

indeed

<EOS>
the

the

Mr.

judgment

<EOS>
while
the
scourge
continue
weekly
to

its
ravage
throughout
the

it
never

suffer
in

from
scorbutic

<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
do
not
dare
to
indulge
a
hope
that
Amabel
would
ever
return
;
but
though
he
suffer
much
in
secret
,
he
never
allow
his
grief
to
manifest
itself
.
<EOS>
the
circumstance
that
he
have
not
receive
any
intelligence
of
her
do
not
weigh
much
with
him
,
because
the
difficulty
of
communication
become
great
and
great
,
as
each
week

increase
in

and
he
be

It
be
not
so
in

but
of
this

<EOS>
the

below

or
off
Wapping
,
hold
as
little
communication
as
possible
with
those
on
shore
,
and
only
receive
fresh
provision
with
the
great
precaution
.
<EOS>
as
the
plague
increase
,
most
of
these
remove
lower
down
the
river
,
and
many
of
them
put
out
entirely
to

<EOS>
above

most

<EOS>
many

during

<EOS>
August

but
the

<EOS>
on
the
contrary

it
manifestly
increase
in
violence
and
malignity
.
<EOS>
the
death
rise
a
thousand
in
each
week
,
and
in
the
last
week
in
this
fatal
month
amount
to
upward
of
sixty
thousand
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
terrible
as
this
be
,
the
pestilence
have
not
yet
reach
its
height
.
<EOS>
hope
be
entertain
that
when
the
weather
become
cool
,
its
fury
would
abate
;
but
these
anticipation
be
fearfully
disappointed
.
<EOS>
the
bill
of
mortality
rise
the
first
week
in
September
to
seven
thousand
,
and
though
they
slightly
decrease
during
the
second
week
--
awaken
a
momentary
hope
--
on
the
third
they
advance
to
twelve
thousand
!
<EOS>
in
less
than
ten
day
,
upwards
of
two
thousand
person
perish
in
the
parish
of
Aldgate
alone
;
while
Whitechapel
suffer
equally
severely
.
<EOS>
out
of
the
hundred
parish
in

about
the
city
,
one
only
,
that
of
Saint
John
the
Evangelist
in
watling
-
street
,
remain
uninfected
,
and
this
merely
because
there
be
scarcely
a
soul
leave
within
it
,
the
great
part
of
the
inhabitant
have
quit
their
house
,
and
flee
into
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
the
deep
despair
now
seize
upon
all
the
survivor
.
<EOS>
scarcely
a
family
but
have
lose
half
of
its
number
--
many
,
more
than
half
--
while
those
who
be
leave
feel
assured
that
their
turn
would
speedily
arrive
.
<EOS>
even
the
reckless
be
appal
,
and
abandon
their
evil
course
.
<EOS>
not
only
be
the
dead
lie
in
the
passage
and
alley
,
but
even
in
the
main
thoroughfare
,
and
none
would
remove
them
.
<EOS>
the
awful
prediction
of
Solomon
Eagle
that
"
grass
would
grow
in
the
street
,
and
that
the
living
should
not
be
able
to
bury
the
dead
,
"
have
come
to
pass
.
<EOS>
London
have
become
one
vast
lazar
-
house
,
and
seem
in
a
fair
way
of
become
a
mighty
sepulchre
.
 
<EOS>
during
all
this
time
,
Saint
Paul
's
continue
to
be
use
as
a
pest
-
house
,
but
it
be
not
so
crowded
as
heretofore
,
because
,
as
not
one
in
fifty
of
the
infect
recover
when
place
under
medical
care
,
it
be
not
think
worth
while
to
remove
them
from
their
own
abode
.
<EOS>
the
number
of
attendant
,
too
,
have
diminish
.
<EOS>
some
have
die
,
but
the
great
part
have
abandon
their
office
from
a
fear
of
share
the
fate
of
their
patient
.
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
these
change
,
Judith
Malmayns
have
be
advance
to
the
post
of
chief
nurse
at
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
both
she
and
Chowles
have
be
attack
by
the
plague
,
and
both
have
recover
.
<EOS>
Judith
attend
the
coffin
-
maker
,
and
it
be
mainly
owe
to
her
that
he
get
through
the
attack
.
<EOS>
She
never
leave
him
for
a
moment
,
and
would
never
suffer
any
one
to
approach
him
--
a
necessary
precaution
,
as
he
be
so
much
alarm
by
his
situation
that
he
would
infallibly
have
make
some
awkward
revelation
.
<EOS>
when
Judith
,
in
her
turn
,
be
seize
,
Chowles
exhibit
no
such
consideration
for
her
,
and
scarcely
affect
to
conceal
his
disappointment
at
her
recovery
.
<EOS>
this
want
of
feeling
on
his
part
greatly
incense
her
against
him
,
and
though
he
contrive
in
some
degree
to
appease
her
,
it
be
long
before
she
entirely
forgive
him
.
<EOS>
far
from
be
amend
by
her
suffering
,
she
seem
to
have
grow
more
obdurate
,
and
instantly
commence
a
fresh
career
of
crime
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
,
however
,
necessary
now
to
hasten
the
end
of
the
sick
.
<EOS>
the
distemper
have
acquire
such
force
and
malignity
that
it
do
its
work
quickly
enough
--
often
too
quickly
--
and
all
she
seek
be
to
obtain
possession
of
the
poor
patient
'
attire
,
or
any
valuable
they
may
possess
worth
appropriate
.
<EOS>
to
turn
to
the
bright
side
of
the
picture
,
it
must
not
be
omit
that
when
the
pestilence
be
at
its
height
,
and
no
offer
could
induce
the
timorous
to
venture
forth
,
or
render
assistance
to
the
sufferer
,
Sir
John
Lawrence
the
Lord
Mayor
,
the
Duke
of
Albermarle
,
the
Earl
of
Craven
,
and
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
devote
themselves
to
the
care
of
the
infected
,
and
supply
them
with
every
necessary
they
require
.
<EOS>
among
the
physician
,
no
one
deserve
more
honourable
mention
than
Doctor
Hodges
,
who
be
unremitte
in
his
attention
to
the
sufferer
.
 
<EOS>
to
return
to
the
grocer
.
<EOS>
while
the
plague
be
thus
rage
around
him
,
and
while
every
house
in
Wood

street
except
one
or
two
,
from
which
the
inmate
have
flee
,
be
attack
by
the
pestilence
,
he
and
his
family
have
remain
untouched
.
<EOS>
about
the
middle
of
August
,
he
experience
a
great
alarm
.
<EOS>
His
second
son
,
Hubert

sick
,
and
he
remove
him
to
one
of
the
upper
room
which
he
have
set
aside
as
an
hospital
,
and
attend
upon
him
himself
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
day
,
however
,
his
fear
be
remove
and
he
find
,
to
his
great
satisfaction
,
that
the
youth
have
not
be
attack
by
the
plague
,
but
be
only
suffer
from
a
slight
fever
,
which
quickly
yield
to
the
remedy
apply
.
<EOS>
about
the
same
time
,
too
,
he
lose
his
porter
,
Dallison
.
<EOS>
the
poor
fellow
do
not
make
his
appearance
as
usual
for
two
day
,
and
intelligence
of
his
fate
be
bring
on
the
follow
day
by
his
wife
,
who
come
to
state
that
her
husband
be
dead
,
and
have
be
throw
into
the
plague

at
Aldgate
.
<EOS>
the
same
night
,
however
,
she
bring
another
man
,
name
Allestry
,
who
take
the
place
of
the
late
porter
,
and
acquaint
his
employer
with
the
deplorable
state
of
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
two
day
afterwards
,
Allestry
himself
die
,
and
Mr.
Bloundel
have
no
one
to
replace
him
.
<EOS>
He
thus
lose
all
mean
of
ascertain
what
be
go
forward
;
but
the
deathlike
stillness
around
him
,
break
only
by
the
hoarse
tolling
of
a
bell
,
by
a
wild
shriek
or
other
appalling
cry
,
proclaim
too
surely
the
terrible
state
of
thing
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
too
,
a
passenger

<EOS>
one
night
,
as

his
course
through
the
street

he

at
which

in
a
loud
voice

"

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
It

now
the
second
week
in
September

and
as

Mr.

receive
no

<EOS>
at

in
the
horror
of
the
general
calamity

<EOS>
satisfied
that
she
be
in
a
healthful
situation
,
and
that
her
chance
of
preservation
from
the
pestilence

well
than

<EOS>
redouble
his

forth
on

<EOS>
on

or

<EOS>
the
broad

fatal
inscription

<EOS>
here
and
there

a
watchman

<EOS>
the
coffin

<EOS>
Crossing
Holborn
Bridge

support
himself
against
a

before

<EOS>
the

frightful
evidence
of
the
ravage
of

observable
here
,
as
elsewhere

<EOS>
the

the
harsh

<EOS>
the

His

dreary
complexion

<EOS>
all

the
aspect

<EOS>
the
few

staggering
towards

and
the

stricken
like
the
inhabitant

<EOS>
the
heat
be
intolerably
oppressive
,
and
the
air
taint
with
noisome
exhalation
.
<EOS>
ever
and
anon
,
a
window
would
be
open
,
and
a
ghastly
face
thrust
from
it
,
while
a

lamentable
cry

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
after

and
on

<EOS>
tear

<EOS>
when
at

little
distance
from

he
pause

and
some
minute
elapse
before
he
could
muster
strength
to
go
forward
.
<EOS>
here
,
as
elsewhere

there
be
abundant
indication
of
the
havoc
occasion
by
the
fell
disease
.
<EOS>
not
far
from
the
grocer

shop

and
in
the
middle
of

lie
the
body
of
a
man

with
the
face
turn
upwards
,
while
crouch

an
angle
of

a
young

<EOS>
as
the

he
recognise
in
the

the
principal

the
Brotherhood
of
Saint

a

the
content

the

habitation

nor
could
he
make
any
one

though
he
knock
loudly
and
repeatedly
against
it

<EOS>
the
shutter
of
the
low
window
be
closed
,
and
the
place
look
completely
desert
.
<EOS>
all
the
adjoining
house
be
shut
up
,
and
not
a
living
being
could
be
discern
in
the
street
from
whom
information
could
be
obtain
relative
to
the
physician
.
<EOS>
here
,
as
elsewhere
,
the
pavement
be
overgrow
with
grass
,
and
the
very
house
have
a
strange
and
melancholy
look
,
as
if
share
in
the
general
desolation
.
<EOS>
on
look
down
a
narrow
street
lead
to
the
river
,
Leonard
perceive
a
flock
of
poultry
scratching
among
the
stave
in
search
of
food
,
and
instinctively
call
them
,
they
fly
towards
him
,
as
if
delight
at
the
unwonted
sound
of
a
human
voice
.
<EOS>
these
,
and
a
half
-
starve
cat
,
be
the
only
thing
live
that
he
could
perceive
.
<EOS>
at
the
further
end
of
the
street
he
catch
sight
of
the
river
,
speed
in
its
course
towards
the
bridge
,
and
scarcely
know
whither
he
be
go
,
saunter
to
its
edge
.
<EOS>
the
tide
have
just
turn
,
and
the
stream
be
sparkle
in
the
sunshine
,
but
no
craft
could
be
discover
upon
its
bosom
;
and
except
a
few
barge
moor
to
its
side
,
all
vestige
of
the
numberless
vessel
with
which
it

<EOS>
Its
quay
be
completely
desert

<EOS>
box
and
bale
of
good
lie
untouched
on
the
wharf
;
the
cheer
cry
with
which
the
workman
formerly
animate
their
labour
be
hush
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
sound
of
creaking
cord
,
no
rattle
of
heavy
chain
--
none
of
the
busy
hum
ordinarily
attend
the
discharge
of
freight
from
a
vessel
,
or
the
packing
of
good
and
store
on
board
.
<EOS>
all
traffic
be
at
an
end
;
and
this
scene
,
usually
one
of
the
lively
possible
,
be
now
forlorn
and
desolate
.
<EOS>
on
the
opposite
shore
of
the
river
it
appear
to
be
the
same
--
indeed
,
the
borough
of
Southwark
be
now
suffer
the
utmost
rigour
of
the
scourge
,
and
except
for
the
row
of
house
on
its
bank
,
and
the
noble
bridge
by
which
it
be
span
,
the
Thames
appear
as
undisturbed
as
it
must
have
be
before
the
great
city
be
build
upon
its
bank
.
 
<EOS>
the
apprentice
view
this
scene
with
a
singular
kind
of
interest
.
<EOS>
He
have
become
so
accustomed
to
melancholy
sight
,
that
his
feeling
have
lose
their
acuteness
,
and
the
contemplation
of
the
desert
building
and
neglect
wharf
around
him
harmonize
with
his
own
gloomy
thought
.
<EOS>
pursue
his
walk
along
the
side
of
the
river
,
he
be
check
by
a
horrible
smell
,
and
look
downward
,
he
perceive
a
carcass
in
the
last
stage
of
decomposition
lie
in
the
mud
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
wash
ashore
by
the
tide
,
and
a
large
bird
of
prey
be
contend
for
the
possession
of
it
with
a
legion
of
water
-
rat
.
<EOS>
sicken
by
the
sight
,
he
turn
up
a
narrow
thoroughfare
near
Baynard
's
Castle
,
and
cross
Thames
-
street
,
be
about
to
ascend
Addle
-
hill
,
when
he
perceive
a
man
wheel
a
hand
-
barrow
,
contain
a
couple
of
corpse
,
in
the
direction
of
the
river
,
with
the
intention
,
doubtless
,
of
throw
them
into
it
,
as
the
readiest
mean
of
dispose
of
them
.
<EOS>
both
body
be
strip
of
their
clothing
,
and
the
blue
tint
of
the
nail
,
as
well
as
the
blotch
with
which
they
be
cover
,
leave
no
doubt
as
to
the
disease
of
which
they
have
die
.
<EOS>
avert
his
gaze
from
the
spectacle
,
Leonard
turn
off
on
the
right
along
Carter
-
lane
,
and
thread
a
short
passage
,
approach
the
southern
boundary
of
the
cathedral
;
and
proceed
towards
the
great
door
opposite
him
,
pass
through
it
.
<EOS>
the
mighty
lazar
-
house
be
less
crowded
than
he
expect
to
find
it
,
but
its
terrible
condition
far
exceed
his
bad
conception
.
<EOS>
not
more
than
half
the
pallet
be
occupy
;
but
as
the
sick
be
in
a
great
measure
leave
to
themselves
,
the
utmost
disorder
prevail
.
<EOS>
a
troop
of
lazar
,
with
sheet
fold
around
them
,
glide
,
like
phantom
,
along
Paul
's
walk
,
and
mimic
in
a
ghastly
manner
the
air
and
deportment
of
the
gallant
who
have
formerly
throng
the
place
.
<EOS>
no
attempt
be
make
to
maintain
silence
,
the
noise
be
perfectly
stunning
;
some
of
the
sick
be
shriek
--
<EOS>
some
laughing
in
a
wild
unearthly
manner
--
<EOS>
some
pray
--
some
uttering
loud
execration
--
other
groan
and
lamenting
.
<EOS>
the
holy
building
seem
to
have
become
the
abode
of
evil
and
torment
spirit
.
<EOS>
many
dead
be
lie
in
the
bed
--
the
few
attendant
who
be
present
not
care
to
remove
them
;
and
Leonard
have
little
doubt
,
that
before
another
sun
go
down
the
whole
of
the
ghastly
assemblage
before
him
would
share
their
fate
.
<EOS>
if
the
habitation
he
have
recently
gaze
upon
have
appear
plague
-
stricken
,
the
sacred
structure
in
which
he
be
now
stand
seem
yet
more
horribly
contaminate
.
<EOS>
Ill
-
keep
and
ill
-
ventilate
,
the
air
be
load
with
noxious
effluvium
,
while
the
various
abomination
that
meet
the
eye
at
every
turn
would
have
be
sufficient
to
produce
the
distemper
in
any
one
who
have
come
in
contact
with
them
.
<EOS>
They
be
,
however
,
utterly
disregard
by
the
miserable
sufferer
and
their
attendant
.
<EOS>
the
magnificent
paint
window
be
dim
by
a
thick
clammy
steam
,
which
could
scarcely
be
wash
off
--
while
the
carved
oak
screen
,
the
sculptured
tomb
,
the
pillar
,
the
wall
,
and
the
flagged
floor
be
cover
with
impurity
.
 
<EOS>
satisfied
with
a
brief
survey
of
this
frightful
scene
,
Leonard
turn
to
depart
,
and
be
pass
the
entrance
to
Saint
Faith
's
,
which
stand
open
,
when
he
catch
sight
of
Judith
stand
at
the
foot
of
the
broad
stone
step
,
and
hold
a
lamp
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
be
converse
with
a
tall
richly
-
dressed
man
,
whose
feature
he
fancy
he
have
see
before
,
though
he
could
not
at
the
moment
call
them
to
mind
.
<EOS>
after
a
brief
conversation
,
they
move
off
into
the
depth
of
the
vault
,
and
he
lose
eight
of
them
.
<EOS>
all
at
once
it
occur
to
Leonard
that
Judith
's
companion
be
the
unfortunate
stranger
whose
child
he
have
inter
,
and
who
have
be
so
strangely
affect
at
the
sight
of
Nizza
Macascree
.
<EOS>
determine
to
ascertain
the
point
,
he
hurry
down
the
step
and
plunge
into
the
vault
.
<EOS>
It
be
bury
in
profound
darkness
,
and
he
have
not
proceed
far
when
he
stumble
over
something
lie
in
his
path
,
and
find
from
the
groan
that
follow
that
it
be
a
plague
-
patient
.
<EOS>
before
he
could
regain
his
foot
,
the
unfortunate
sufferer
whom
he
have
thus
disturb
implore
him
,
in
piteous
accent
,
which
,
with
a
shudder
,
he
recognise
as
those
of
Blaize
,
to
remove
him
.
<EOS>
Leonard
immediately
give
the
poor
porter
to
understand
that
he
be
near
him
,
and
would
render
him
every
aid
in
his
power
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
assistance
come
too
late
,
Leonard
,
"
groan
<EOS>
Blaize--"it
be
all
over
with
me
now
,
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
like
to
breathe
my
last
in
this
dismal
vault
,
without
medicine
or
food
,
both
of
which
I
be
deny
by
that
infernal
hag
Mother
Malmayns
,
who
call
herself
a
nurse
,
but
who
be
in
reality
a
robber
and
murderess

<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
the
frightful
scene
I
have
witness
since
I
have
be
bring
here
!
<EOS>
I
tell
you
I
should
not
escape
the
plague
.
<EOS>
I
shall
die
of
it
<EOS>
--
I
be
sure
I
shall
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
be
at
the
pest
-
house
in
Finsbury
Fields
,
"
say
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
take
there
,
"
reply
Blaize
;
"
but
the
place
be
full
,
and
they
would
not
admit
me
,
so
I
be
send
to
Saint
Paul
's
,
where
there
be
plenty
of
room
.
<EOS>
yesterday
I
do
pretty
well
,
for
I
be
in
the
great
ward
above
,
and
one
of
the
attendant
obey
my
direction
implicitly
,
and
I
be
certain
<EOS>
if
they
have
be
fully
carry
out
,
I
should
have
get
well
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
what
I
do
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
be
place
on
a
pallet
,
and
cover
with
blanket
,
I
order
a
drink
to
be
prepare
of
the
inner
bark
of
an
ash
-
tree
,
green
walnut
,
scabious
vervain
,
and
saffron
,
boil
in
two
quart
of
the
strong
vinegar
.
<EOS>
of
this
mixture
I
drink
plentifully
,
and
it
soon
produce
a
plentiful
perspiration
.
<EOS>
I
next
have
a
hen
--
a
live
one
,
of
course
--
strip
of
the
feather
,
and
bring
to
me
.
<EOS>
Its
bill
be
hold
to
the
large
blotch
under
my
arm
,
and
keep
there
till
the
fowl
die
from
the
noxious
matter
it
draw
forth
.
<EOS>
I
next
repeat
the
experiment
with
a
pigeon
,
and
derive
the
great
benefit
from
it
.
<EOS>
the
tumour
have
nearly
subside
,
and
if
I
have
be
properly
treat
afterwards
,
I
should
now
be
in
a
fair
way
of
recovery
.
<EOS>
but
instead
of

,
flavour
with
succory
and
marigold
;

"
 
<EOS>
"
that
I
will
readily
do
,
"
reply
Leonard
;
"
but
I
must
first
procure
a
light
.
<EOS>
"
with
this
,
he
grope
his
way
among
the
close
rank
of
ponderous
pillar
,
but
though
he
proceed
with
the
utmost
caution
,
he
could
not
avoid
come
in
contact
with
the
bed
of
some
of
the
other
patient
,
and
disturb
them
.
<EOS>
at
length
he
descry
a
glimmer
of
light
issue
from
a
door

he
know
to
be
that
of
the
vestry

slightly
ajar

open
it

seize
it

<EOS>
poor
Blaize

a
lamentable

grotesque
appearance

His
plump
person

greatly
reduce

his
round

become
hollow

cadaverous

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
It
do
not
escape
Leonard
that
the
porter
treat
the
stranger
with
great
respect
,
and
he
infer
from
this
that
he
be
a
person
of
some
consideration
,
as
indeed
his
deportment
bespeak
him
.
<EOS>
the

voice

emotion

that

street
on
the
way
,
that
he
may
inquire
whether
his
master

him
.
<EOS>
Thirlby
agree
to
this
,
and
the
old
porter
repeat
his
assurance
that
Leonard
may
make
himself
quite
easy
as
to
Blaize
,
for
he
would
send

that
night

him
to
observe
the
utmost
caution
.
<EOS>
this
the
apprentice
promise
,
and
join
Thirlby
,
who
have
walk
forward
to
a
little
distance
,
they
strike
into
a
narrow
street
on
the
right
,
and
proceed
along
Aldermanbury
,
soon
arrive
at
the
first
postern
in
the
city
wall
beyond
Cripplegate
.
 
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
Thirlby
have
maintain
a
profound
silence
,
and
appear
lose
in
melancholy
reflection
.
<EOS>
except
now
and
then
cast
a
commiserate
glance
at
the
wretched
object
they
encounter
on
the
road
,
he
keep
his
eye
steadily
fix
upon
the
ground
,
and
walk
at
a
brisky
pace
,
as
if
desirous
of
get
out
of
the
city
as
quickly
as
possible
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
his
weakness
,
Leonard
manage
to
keep
up
with
him
,
and
his
curiosity
be
greatly
arouse
by
what
have
just
occur
,
he
begin
to
study
his
appearance
and
feature
attentively

<EOS>
Thirlby

full
six
foot

and
possess
a
powerful
and
well

proportion
figure
,
and
would
have

extremely
handsome

for
a
certain
sinister
expression
about
the
eye
,
which
be
large
and
dark
,
but
light
by
a
fierce
and
peculiar
fire
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
be
dark
,
and
his
countenance
still
bear
the
impress
of
the
dreadful
disease
from
which
he
have
recently
recover
.
<EOS>
a
gloomy
shade
sit
about
his
brow
,
and
it
seem
to
Leonard
as
if
he
have
be
lead
by
his
passion
into
the
commission
of
crime
of
which
he
have
afterwards
bitterly
repent
.
<EOS>
His
deportment
be
proud
and
commanding
,
and
though
he
exhibit
no
haughtiness
towards
the
apprentice
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
treat
him
with
great
familiarity
,
it
be
plain
<EOS>
he
do
so
merely
from
a
sense
of
gratitude

<EOS>
His

shriek
of

heart

and
question
a
watchman
who
stand
at
an
adjoining
door
,
as
to
the
cause
of
them

they
proceed
from
a

"
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
find
some
difficulty
in

into
the
house

"
say
the
watchman
,
who
evidently
feel
some
repugnance
to
the
task
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
so
,
"
reply
Thirlby
.
<EOS>
and
push
forcibly
against
the
door
,
he
burst
it
open
,
and
,
direct
by
the
cry
,
enter
a
room
on
the
right

<EOS>
the
watchman

statement
prove
correct

<EOS>
stretch
upon
a
bed
in
one
corner
lie
the
body
of
a
beautiful
girl

while
the
poor
mother
be
bend
over
it
in

state
border
on
distraction

<EOS>
on
see
Thirlby
,
she
flee
to
the
further
end
of
the
room

but
do
not
desist
from
her
cry
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
she
be
unable
to
do
so
,
be
under
the
dominion

the
wildest
hysterical
passion

<EOS>
in
vain
Thirlby
endeavour

<EOS>
wave

Thirlby
motion
the

who
have
follow
him
into

room

to
bring
away
the
body

and
rush
forth

<EOS>
His
injunction
be
obey

<EOS>
the
remain
of
the
unfortunate
girl
be
wrap
in
a
sheet
,
and
deposit
in

barrow
.
<EOS>
the
miserable
mother
follow
the
watchman
to
the
door
,
but
do
not
attempt
to
interfere
with
him
,
and
have
see
the
body
of
her
child
dispose
of
in
the
manner
above
describe
,
turn
back
.
<EOS>
the
next
moment
,
a
heavy
sound
proclaim
that
she
have
fall
to
the
ground
,
and
her
shriek
be
hush
.
<EOS>
Thirlby
and
Leonard
exchange
sad
and
significant
look
,
but
neither
of
them
go
back
to
see
what
have
happen
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
watchman
shake
his
head
,
and
set
the
barrow
in
motion
,
proceed
along
a
narrow
footpath
across
the
field
.
<EOS>
remark
that
he
do
not
take
the
direct
road
to
the
plague
-
pit
,
Leonard
call
to
him
,
and
point
out
the
corner
in
which
it
lie
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
where
the
old
plague
-
pit
be
,
as
well
as
you
,
"
reply
the
watchman
,
"
but
it
have
be
fill
these
three
week
.
<EOS>
the
new
pit
lie
in
this
direction
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
pursue
his
course
,
and
they
presently
enter
a
field
,
in
the
middle
of
which
lie
the
plague
-
pit
,
as
be
evident
from
the
immense
mound
of
clay
throw
out
of
the
excavation
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
pit
be
neither
so
deep
nor
so
wide
as
the
old
one
,
"
say
the
watchman
,
"
and
if
the
plague
go
on
at
this
rate
,
they
will
soon
have
to
dig
another
--
that
is
,
if
any
one
should
be
leave
alive
to
undertake
the
job
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
chuckle
as
if
he
have
say
a
good
thing
,
he
impel
his
barrow
forward
more
quickly
.
<EOS>
a
few
second
bring
them
near
the
horrible
chasm
.
<EOS>
It
be
more
than
half
full
,
and
in
all
respect
resemble
the
other
pit
,
except
that
it
be
somewhat
small
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
same
heaving
and
putrefy
mass,--the
same
ghastly
object
of
every
kind,--the
grey
-
head
old
man
,
the
dark
-
haired
maiden
,
the
tender
infant,--all
huddle
together
.
<EOS>
wheel
the
barrow
to
the
edge
of
the
pit
,
the
watchman
cast
his
load
into
it
;
and
without
even
tarry
to
throw
a
handful
of
soil
over
it
,
turn
back
,
and
rejoin
Thirlby
,
who
have
halt
at
some
distance
from
the
excavation
.
<EOS>
while
the
latter
be
search
for
his
purse
to
reward
the
watchman
,
they
hear
wild
shriek
in
the
adjoining
field
,
and
the
next
moment
perceive
the
wretched
mother
run
towards
them
.
<EOS>
guess
her
purpose
from
his
former
experience
,
Leonard
call
to
the
other
to
stop
her
,
and
stretch
out
his
arm
,
place
himself
in
her
path
.
<EOS>
but
all
their
effort
be
in
vain
.
<EOS>
She
dart
past
them
,
and
though
Leonard
catch
hold
of
her
,
she
break
from
him
,
and
leave
a
fragment
of
her
dress
in
his
grasp
,
fling
herself
into
the
chasm
.
 
<EOS>
well
know
that
all
help
be
vain
,
Thirlby
place
a
few
piece
of
money
in
the
watchman
's
hand
,
and
hurry
away
.
<EOS>
He
be
follow
by
Leonard
,
who
be
equally
eager
to
quit
the
spot
.
<EOS>
It
so
chance
that
the
path
they
have
take
lead
them
near
the
site
of
the
old
plague
-
pit
,
and
Leonard
point
it
out
to
his
companion
.
<EOS>
the
latter
stop
for
a
moment
,
and
then
,
without
say
a
word
,
run
quickly
towards
it
.
<EOS>
on
reach
the
spot
,
they
find
that
the
pit
be
completely
fill
up
.
<EOS>
the
vast
cake
of
clay
with
which
it
be
cover
have
swell
and
crack
in
an
extraordinary
manner
,
and
emit
such
a
horrible
effluvium
that
they
both
instantly
retreat
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
that
be
the
grave
of
my
poor
child
,
"
cry
Thirlby
,
halt
,
and
burst
into
a
passionate
flood
of
tear
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
have
be
a
fitting
rest
-
place
for
a
guilty
wretch
like
me
;
but
for
her
it
be
horrible
.
"
 
<EOS>
allow
time
for
the
violence
of
his
grief
to
subside
,
Leonard
address
a
few
word
of
consolation
to
him
,
and
then
try
to
turn
the
current
of
his
thought
by
introduce
a
different
subject
.
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
he
proceed
to
detail
the
piper
's
mysterious
conduct
as
to
the
packet
,
and
conclude
by
mention
the
piece
of
gold
which
Nizza
wear
as
an
amulet
,
and
which
she
fancy
must
have
some
connection
with
her
early
history
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
of
the
packet
and
amulet
from
Doctor
Hodges
,
"
say
Thirlby
,
"
and
should
have
visit
the
piper
on
my
recovery
from
the
plague
,
but
I
be
all
impatience
to
behold
Nizza
,
and
could
not
brook
an
instant
's
delay
.
<EOS>
but
you
know
his
cottage
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
be
far
from
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yonder
<EOS>
it
be
,
"
reply
Leonard
,
point
to
the
little
habitation
,
which
lie
at
a
field
's
distance
from
them--"and
<EOS>
we
be
certain
to
meet
with
him
,
for
I
hear
the
note
of
his
pipe
.
"
 
<EOS>
nor
be
he
deceive
,
for
as
they
cross
the
field
,
and
approach
the
cottage
,
<EOS>
the
sound
of
a
melancholy
air
play
on
the
pipe
become
each
instant
more
distinct
.
<EOS>
before
enter
the
gate
,
they
pause
for
a
moment
to
listen
to
the
music
,
and
Leonard
could
not
help
contrast
the
present
neglect
appearance
of
the
garden
with
the
neatness
it
exhibit
when
he
last
see
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
overgrow
with
weed
,
while
the
drooping
flower
seem
to
bemoan
the
loss
of
their
mistress
.
<EOS>
Leonard
's
gaze
involuntarily
wander
in
search
of
the
old
apple
-
tree
,
and
he
presently
discover
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
load
with
fruit
,
and
the
rounded
sod
beneath
it
proclaim
the
grave
of
the
ill
-
fate
Dame
Lucas
.
 
<EOS>
satisfied
with
this
survey
,
Leonard
open
the
gate
,
but
have
no
sooner
set
foot
in
the
garden
than
the
loud
barking
of
a
dog
be
hear
,
and
Bell
rush
forth
.
<EOS>
Leonard
instantly
call
to
her
,
and
on
hear
his
voice
,
the
little
animal
instantly
change
her
angry
tone
to
a
gladsome
whine
,
and
,
skip
towards
him
,
fawn
at
his
foot
.
<EOS>
while
he
stoop
to
caress
her
,
the
piper
,
who
have
be
alarm
by
the
barking
,
appear
at
the
door
,
and
call
out
to
know
who
be
there
?
<EOS>
at
the
sight
of
him
,
Thirlby
,
who
be
close
behind
Leonard
,
utter
a
cry
of
surprise
,
and
exclaim
,
"
It
be
he
!
"
<EOS>
rush
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
cry
of
recognition
utter
by
the
stranger
cause
the
piper
to
start
as
if
he
have
receive
a
sudden
and
violent
shock
.
<EOS>
the
ruddy
tint
instantly
desert
his
cheek
,
and
be
succeed
by
a
deadly
paleness
;
his
limb
tremble
,
and
he
bend
forward
with
a
countenance
of
the
utmost
anxiety
,
as
if
await
a
confirmation
of
his
fear
.
<EOS>
when
within
a
couple
of
yard
of
him
,
Thirlby
pause
,
and
have
narrowly
scrutinize
his
feature
,
as
if
to
satisfy
himself
he
be
not
mistaken
,
again
exclaim
,
though
in
a
low
and
deep
tone
than
before
,
"
It
be
he
!
"
<EOS>
and
seize
his
arm
,
push
him
into
the
house
,
bang
the
door
to
after
him
in
such
a
manner
as
to
leave
no
doubt
in
the
apprentice
's
mind
that
his
presence
be
not
desire
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
though
extremely
anxious
to
hear
what
pass
between
them
,
certain
their
conversation
must
relate
to
Nizza
Macascree
,
Leonard
do
not
attempt
to
follow
,
but
,
accompany
by
Bell
,
who
continue
to
gambol
round
him
,
direct
his
step
towards
the
grave
of
Dame
Lucas
.
<EOS>
here
he
endeavour
to
beguile
the
time
in
meditation
,
but
in
spite
of
his
effort
to
turn
his
thought
into
a
different
channel
,
they
perpetually
recur
to
what
he
suppose
to
be
take
place
inside
the
house
.
<EOS>
the
extraordinary
effect
produce
by
Nizza
Macascree
on
Thirlby
--
the
resemblance
he
have
discover
between
her
and
some
person
dear
to
him
--
the
anxiety
he
appear
to
feel
for
her
,
as
evince
by
his
recent
search
for
her
--
the
mysterious
connection
which
clearly
subsist
between
him
and
the
piper
--
all
these
circumstance
convince
Leonard
that
Thirlby
be
,
or
imagine
himself
,
connect
by
tie
of
the
close
relationship
with
the
suppose
piper
's
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
Leonard
have
never
be
able
to
discern
the
slight
resemblance
either
in
manner
or
feature
,
or
in
those
indescribably
slight
personal
peculiarity
that
constitute
a
family
likeness
,
between
Nizza
and
her
repute
father
--
neither
could
he
now
recall
any
particular
resemblance
between
her
and
Thirlby
;
still
he
could
not
help
think
her
beauty
and
high
-
breed
<EOS>
look
savour
more
of
the
latter
than
the
former
.
<EOS>
He
come
,
therefore
,
to
the
conclusion
that
she
must
be
the
offspring
of
some
early
and
unfortunate
attachment
on
the
part
of
Thirlby
,
whose
remorse
may
naturally
be
the
consequence
of
his
culpable
conduct
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
His
sole
perplexity
be
the
piper
's
connection
with
the
affair
;
but
he
get
over
this
difficulty
by
suppose
that
Nizza
's
mother
,
whoever
she
be
,
must
have
commit
her
to
Macascree
's
care
when
an
infant
,
probably
with
strict
injunction
,
which
circumstance
may
render
necessary
,
to
conceal
her
even
from
her
father
.
<EOS>
such
be
Leonard
's
solution
of
the
mystery
;
and
feel
convinced
that
he
have
make
himself
master
of
the
stranger
's
secret
,
he
resolve
to
give
him
to
understand
as
much
as
soon
as
he
behold
him
again
.
 
<EOS>
More
than
half
an
hour
have
elapse
,
and
Thirlby
not
come
forth
,
Leonard
begin
to
think
sufficient
time
have
be
allow
him
for
private
conference
with
the
piper
,
and
he
therefore
walk
towards
the
door
,
and
cough
to
announce
his
approach
,
raise
the
latch
and
enter
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
find
the
pair
seat
close
together
,
and
converse
in
a
low
and
earnest
tone
.
<EOS>
the
piper
have
completely
recover
from
his
alarm
,
and
seem
perfectly
at
ease
with
his
companion
,
while
all
trace
of
anger
have
disappear
from
the
countenance
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
before
them
on
the
table
lie
several
letter
,
take
from
a
packet
,
the
cover
of
which
Leonard
recognise
as
the
one
that
have
be
formerly
intrust
to
him
.
<EOS>
amidst
them
be
the
miniature
of
a
lady
--
at
least
,
it
appear
so
to
Leonard
,
in
the
hasty
glance
he
catch
of
it
;
but
he
could
not
be
quite
sure
;
for
on
see
him
,
Thirlby
close
the
case
,
and
place
his
hand
on
the
piper
's
mouth
,
to
check
his
further
speech
,
arise
.
 
<EOS>
"
forgive
my
rudeness
,
"
he
say
to
the
apprentice
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
be
so
deeply
interested
in
what
I
have
just
hear
,
that
I
quite
forget
you
be
wait
without
.
<EOS>
I
shall
remain
here
some
hour
longer
,
but
will
not
detain
you
,
especially
as
I
be
unable
to
admit
you
to
our
conference
.
<EOS>
I
will
meet
you
at
Doctor
Hodges
's
in
the
evening
,
and
shall
have
much
to
say
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
anticipate
some
part
of
your
communication
,
"
reply
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
tell
me
you
have
a
daughter
still
live
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
inquisitive
,
young
man
,
"
rejoin

<EOS>
"
You
do
me
wrong
,
sir
,
"
reply
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
curiosity
as
regard
yourself
;
and
if
I
have
,
would
never
lower
myself
in
my
own
estimation
to
gratify
it
.
<EOS>
feel
a
strong
interest
in
Nizza
Macascree
,
I
be
naturally
anxious
to
know
whether
my
suspicion
that
a
near
relationship
subsist
between
yourself
and
her
be
correct
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
enter
into
further
explanation
now
,

return
Thirlby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
meet
me
at
Doctor
Hodges
's
this
evening
,
and
you
shall
know
more
.
<EOS>
and
now
farewell
.
<EOS>
I
be
in
the
midst
of
a
deeply
-
interesting
conversation
,
which
your
presence
interrupt
.
<EOS>
do
not
think
me
rude
--
do
not
think
me
ungrateful
.
<EOS>
My
anxiety
must
plead
my
excuse
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
none
be
necessary
,
sir
,
"
reply
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
no
longer
place
any
restraint
upon
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
and
take
care
not
to
let
Bell
out
,
he
pass
through
the
door
,
and
close
it
after
him
.
<EOS>
have
walk
to
some
distance
across
the
field
,
muse
on
what
have
just
occur
,
and
scarcely
conscious
whither
<EOS>
he
be
go
,
he
throw
himself
down
on
the
grass
,
and
fall
asleep
.
<EOS>
He
awake
after
some
time
much
refresh
,
and
find
he
be
considerably
near
Bishopsgate
than
any
other
entrance
into
the
city
,
determine
to
make
for
it
.
<EOS>
a
few
minute
bring
him
to
a
row
of
house
without
the
wall
,
none
of
which
appear
to
have
escape
infection
,
and
pass
them
,
he
enter
the
city
gate
.
<EOS>
as
he
proceed
along
the
once
-
crowd
but
now
utterly
-
desert
thoroughfare
that
open
upon
him
,
he
could
scarcely
believe
he
be
in
a
spot
which
have
once
be
the
busy
of
the
busy
haunt
of
man
--
so
silent
,
<EOS>
so
desolate
do
it
appear
!
<EOS>
on
reach
Cornhill
,
he
find
it
equally
desert
.
<EOS>
the
Exchange
be
closed
,
and
as
Leonard
look
at
its
bar
gate
,
a
saddening
train
of
reflection
pass
through
his
mind
.
<EOS>
His
head
decline
upon
his
breast
,
and
he
continue
lose
in
a
mournful
reverie
until
he
be
rouse
by
a
hand
lay
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
start
--
for
such
a
salutation
at
this
season
be
alarming
--
he
look
round
,
and
beheld
Solomon
Eagle
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
look
upon
that
structure
,
"
say
the
enthusiast
,
"
and
be
think
how
much
it
be
change
.
<EOS>
man
who
possess
boundless
rich
imagine
their
power
above
that
of
their
maker
,
and
suppose
they
may
neglect
and
defy
him
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
mistaken
.
<EOS>
where
be
now
the
wealthy
merchant
who
use
to
haunt
those
court
and
chambers?--why
<EOS>
do
they
not
come
here
as
of
old?--why
<EOS>
do
they
not
buy
and
sell
,
and
send
their
messenger
and
ship
to
the
farth
part
of
the
world
?
<EOS>
because
the
Lord
hath
smite
them
and
drive
them
forth--'From
the
least
of
them
even
to
the
great
of
them
,
'
as
the
prophet
Jeremiah
saith
,
'
every
one
have
be
give
to
covetousness
.
'
<EOS>
the
balance
of
deceit
have
be
in
their
hand
.
<EOS>
They
have
cozen
their
neighbour
,
and
greedily
gain
from
them
,
and
will
find
it
true
what
the
prophet
Ezekiel
hath
write
,
that
'
the
Lord
will
pour
out
his
indignation
upon
them
,
and
consume
them
with
the
fire
of
his
wrath
.
'
<EOS>
yea
,
I
tell
you
,
unless
they
turn
from
their
evil
way
--
unless
they
cast
aside
the
golden
idol
they
now
worship
,
and
set
up
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
in
its
stead
,
a
fire
will
be
send
to
consume
them
,
and
that
pile
which
they
have
erect
as
a
temple
to
their
god
shall
be
burn
to
the
ground
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
's
heart
be
too
full
to
make
any
answer
,
and
the
enthusiast
,
after
a
brief
pause
,
again
address
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
you
see
Doctor
Hodges
pass
this
way
?
<EOS>
I
be
in
search
of
him

"
 
<EOS>

on

account

ask
Leonard
anxiously

<EOS>
His

<EOS>

in

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not

rejoin
the
apprentice

Saint
Paul

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
leave
the
cathedral

Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can

the
enthusiast

I
hear
one
of
the
chirurgeon
say
that
Doctor
Hodges
have
pronounce
him
in
a
fair
way
of
recovery

but
I
must
either
find

go
elsewhere

<EOS>
farewell
!

<EOS>

I
will
go

Solomon

ask
the
apprentice

<EOS>
"
do
not

me

leave
me

the
enthusiast

<EOS>
"
do
you
know
aught
of
Amabel

of
her
retreat

<EOS>
persist
Leonard
,
who
have
a
strange
misgiving
that
the
enthusiast
's
errand
in
some
way
refer
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
reply
Solomon
Eagle

gloomily
;

I
again
advise
you
not

me
further

Solomon
Eagle

I
shall
allay
your
fear
in
that
respect
when
I
tell
you

sick
of
the
plague

"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
hear
nothing
more
,
for
,
utter
a
wild
shriek
,
he
fall
to
the
ground
insensible
.
<EOS>
He
be
arouse
to
consciousness
by
a
sudden
sense
of
strangulation
,
and
open
his
eye
,
beheld
two
dark
figure
bend
over
him
,
one
of
whom
be
kneel
on
his
chest

<EOS>
a
glance
show
him
that
this
person
be
Chowles

and
instantly
comprehend
what
be
the
matter

and
aware
that

him
previously
to
throw
him
into
the
dead

cart
,
which
be
stand
hard
by

he
cry
aloud
,
and
struggle
desperately
to
set
himself
free
.
<EOS>
little
opposition
be

;
for
,
on
hear
the
cry
,
Chowles
quit
his
hold
,
and
retreat
to
a
short
distance

exclaim
,
with
a
look
of
surprise

Leonard

furiously

<EOS>
and
chance

perceive
a
fork

drop
by
Chowles
in
his
hasty
retreat

he
snatch
it
up
,
and

brandish
it
over

<EOS>
thus

<EOS>
"
They

therefore
you

I

I

Leonard

not

Chowles

<EOS>
and
hastily
snatch
up
the
livery
,
he
put
the
cart
in
motion
,
and
proceed
on
his
road
.
<EOS>
Leonard
would
have
follow
him
,
but
the
state
of
his
attire
do
not
permit
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
have
dress
himself
,
he
hasten
to
the
cathedral
,
where
he
soon
find
the
attendant
who
have
charge
of
Blaize
.
 
<EOS>
"
Doctor
Hodges
have
be
with
him
,
"
say
the
man
,
in
reply
to
his
inquiry
after
the
porter
,
"
and
have
good
hope
of
him
.
<EOS>
but
the
patient
be
not
entirely
satisfied
with
the
treatment
he
have
receive
,
and
wish
to
try
some
remedy
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
be
his
request
grant
,
all
would
soon
be
over
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
I
be
sure
of
,
"
reply
Leonard
.
"
<EOS>
but
let
us
go
to
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
heed
his
complaint
,
"
return
the
attendant
.
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
he
be
do
as
well
as
possible
;
but
he
be
so
dreadfully
frightened
at
a
trifling
operation
which
Doctor
Hodges
find
it
necessary
to
perform
upon
him
,
that
we
have
be
oblige
to
fasten
him
to
the
bed
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
"
exclaim
Leonard
,
suspiciously
.
"
<EOS>
have
Judith
Malmayns
have
no
hand
in
this
arrangement
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Judith
Malmayns
have
be
absent
during
the
whole
of
the
afternoon
,
"
say
the
man
,
"
and
another
nurse
have
take
her
place
in
Saint
Faith
's
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
be
near
Blaize
since
I
have
have
charge
of
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
they
have
reach
the
pallet
in
which
the
porter
be
lay
.
<EOS>
His
eye
and
a
small
portion
of
his
snub
-
nose
be
alone
visible
,
his
head
be
still
envelop
by
the
linen
cloth
,
while
his
mouth
be
cover
by
blanket
.
<EOS>
He
look
so
anxiously
at
the
apprentice
,
that
the
latter
remove
the
covering
from
his
mouth
,
and
enable
him
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
to
find
you
be
get
on
so
well
,
"
say
Leonard
,
in
a
cheerful
tone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Doctor
Hodges
have
be
with
you
,
I
understand
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
have
,
"
groan
Blaize
;
"
but
he
have
do
me
no
good
--
<EOS>
none
<EOS>
whatever
.
<EOS>
I
could
doctor
myself
much
better
,
if
I
may
be
allow
;
for
I
know
every
remedy
that
have
be
prescribe
for
the
plague
;
but
he
would
adopt
none
that
I
mention
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
want
him
to
place
a
hot
loaf
,
fresh
from
the
oven
,
to
the
tumour
,
to
draw
it
;
but
he
would
not
consent
.
<EOS>
then
I
ask
for
a
cataplasm
,
compose
of
radish
-
root
,
mustard
-
seed
,
onion
and
garlic
roast
,
mithridate
,
salt
,
and
soot
from
a
chimney
where
wood
only
have
be
burn
.
<EOS>
this
he
like
no
well
than
the
first
.
<EOS>
next
,
I
beg
for
an
ale
posset
with
pimpernel
soak
in
it
,
assure
him
that
by
frequently
drink
such
a
mixture
,
Secretary
Naunton
draw
the
infection
from
his
very
heart
.
<EOS>
but
the
doctor
would
have
none
of
it
,
and
seem
to
doubt
the
fact
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
he
do
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
apply
oil
of
St.
John
's
wort
to
the
tumour
,
"
reply
Blaize
,
with
a
dismal
groan
,
and
say
,
"
if
the
scar
do
not
fall
off
,
he
must
cauterize
it
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
shall
never
be
able
to
bear
the
pain
of
the
operation

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
recollect
your
life
be
at
stake

rejoin
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
either
submit
to
it
or
die

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
must
,
"
reply
Blaize
,
with
a
prolong
groan
;
"
but
it
be
a
terrible
alternative
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
find
the
operation
so
painful
as
you
imagine
,

rejoin
Leonard
;

and
you
know
I
speak
from
personal
experience

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
give
me
great
comfort
,
"
say
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
you
really
think
I
shall
get
well
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
of
it
,
if
you
keep
up
your
spirit

reply
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
the
bad
be
evidently
over
.
<EOS>
behave
like
a
man
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
to
do
so
,
"
rejoin
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
tell
that
if
a
circle
be
draw
with
a
blue
sapphire
round

blotch

it
will
fall
off

Could
not

just
try
the
experiment
?

<EOS>
"
It
will
not
do
to
rely
upon
it

observe
the
attendant
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
a
small
knob
of
red
-
hot
iron
,
which
we
call
the
'
button

much
more
efficacious
.

<EOS>
"
oh
dear
!
<EOS>
oh
dear
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Blaize
,
"
I
already
feel
that
dreadful
button
burn
into
my
flesh

<EOS>
"
on
the
contrary
,
you
will
not

it
at
all

the
attendant

the
iron

the
point

how

My

<EOS>
I

the

the

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
You

"
reply
the
old
porter
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
sure
way
to
meet
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thirlby
,
however
,
be
too
full
of
anxiety
to
listen
to
reason
,
and
his
impatience
produce
a
corresponding
effect
upon
Leonard
,
though
from
a
different
motive
,
they
set
forth
together
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
fail
to
find
him
,
you
may
expect
me
back
ere
long
,
"
be
Thirlby
's
last
word
to
the
porter
.
<EOS>
hurry
along
watling
-
street
,
and
take
the
first
turning
on
the
right
,
he
descend
to
Thames
-
street
,
and
make
the
good
of
his
way
towards
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
Leonard
follow
him
closely
,
and
they
pursue
their
rapid
course
in
silence
.
<EOS>
by
the
time
they
reach
the
north
gate
of
the
bridge
,
Leonard
find
his
strength
fail
him
,
and
halt
at
one
of
the
opening
between
the
tall
house
overlook
the
river
,
where
there
be
a
wooden
bench
for
the
accommodation
of
passenger
,
he
sink
upon
it
,
and
beg
Thirlby
to
go
on
,
say
he
would
return
to
watling

street
as
soon
as
he
recover
from
his
exhaustion
.
<EOS>
Thirlby
do
not
attempt
to
dissuade
him
from
his
purpose
,
but
instantly
disappear
.
 
<EOS>
the
night
,
it
have
before
be
remark
,
be
singularly
beautiful
.
<EOS>
It
be
almost
as
light
as
day
,
for
the
full
harvest
moon
(
alas
!
<EOS>
there
be
no
harvest
for
it
to
smile
upon
!
)
<EOS>
have
just
rise
,
reveal
every
object
with
perfect
distinctness
.
<EOS>
the
bench
on
which
Leonard
be
seat
lie
on
the
right
side
of
the
bridge
,
and
command
a
magnificent
reach
of
the
river
,
that
flow
beneath
like
a
sheet
of
molten
silver
.
<EOS>
the
apprentice
gaze
along
its
bank
,
and
notice
the
tall
spectral
-
look
house
on
the
right
,
until
his
eye
finally
settle
on
the
massive
fabric
of
Saint
Paul
's
,
the
roof
and
tower
of
which
rise
high
above
the
less
structure
.
<EOS>
His
meditation
be
suddenly
interrupt
by
the
opening
of
a
window
in
the
house
near
him
,
while
a
loud
splash
in
the
water
tell
that
a
body
have
be
throw
into
it
.
<EOS>
He
turn
away
with
a
shudder
,
and
at
the
same
moment
perceive
a
watchman
,
with
a
halberd
upon
his
shoulder
,
advance
slowly
towards
him
from
the
southwark
side
of
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
pause
as
he
draw
near
the
apprentice
,
the
watchman
compassionately
inquire
whether
he
be
sick
,
and
be
answer
in
the
negative
,
be
about
to
pass
on
,
when
Leonard
,
fancy
he
recognise
his
voice
,
stop
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
meet
somewhere
before

friend

he
say
,
"
though
where
,
or
under
what
circumstance

I
can
not
at
this
moment
call
to
mind

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
unlikely

"
return
the
other
,
roughly
,
"
but
the
chance
be
against
our
meeting
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
heave
a
sigh
at
this
remark
.
<EOS>
"
I
now
recollect
where
I
meet
you
,
friend

"
he
remark
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
at
Saint
Paul

in
search
of
my
master

daughter
,
who
have
be
carry
off
by
the
Earl
of
Rochester

<EOS>
but
you
be
then
in
the
garb
of
a
smith

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
recollect
the
circumstance

remind
me

it

reply
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
name
be
Leonard
Holt
as
surely
as
mine

Robert
Rainbird

<EOS>
I
recollect
,
also
,
that
you
offend
me
about
a
dog
belong
to
the
piper

pretty
daughter
,
Nizza
Macascree
,
which
I
be
about
to
destroy
in
obedience
to
the
Lord
Mayor
's
command

<EOS>
however
,
I
bear
no
malice
,
and
if
I
do
,
this
be
not
a
time
to
rip
up
old
quarrel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
right
,
friend

"
return
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
the
few
of
us
leave
ought
to
be
in
charity
with
each
other
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
truly
,
ought
we
,
"
rejoin
Rainbird
.
<EOS>
"
for
my
own
part
,
I
have
see
so
much
misery
within
the
last
few
week
,
that
my
disposition
be
wholly
change
.
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
abandon
my
old
occupation
of
a
smith
,
because
my
master
die
of
the
plague
,
and
there
be
no
one
else
to
employ
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
therefore
serve
as
a
watchman
,
and
in
twenty
day
have
stand
at
the
door
of
more
than
twenty
house

It

freeze
your

<EOS>
"
It
may
have
do
formerly

Leonard

my
feeling

much
change

your
own

I
have
have
the
plague
twice
myself

God

I
have
hitherto
escape
it

<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
these
be
terrible

terrible

<EOS>
the
bad
that
ever
London
know

although
I
have
be
hitherto
miraculously
preserve
myself

I
be
firmly
persuade
no
one
will
escape

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
almost
inclined
to
agree
with
you
,
"
reply
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
for
the
last
week
the
distemper
have
rage
fearfully
--
fearfully
,
indeed
,
"
say
Rainbird
;
"
but
yesterday
and
to
-
day
have
far
exceed
all
that
have
go
before
.
<EOS>
the
distemper
have
die
quicker
than
cattle
of
the
murrain

<EOS>
I
visit
upwards
of
a
hundred
house
in
the
Borough
this
morning
,
and
only
find
ten
person
alive
;
and
out
of
those
ten
,
not
one
,
I
will
venture
to
say
,
be
alive
now
.
<EOS>
It
will
,
in
truth
,
be
a
mercy
if
they
be
go
.
<EOS>
there
be
distract
mother
rave
over
their
children,--a
young
husband
lament
his
wife,--two
little
child
weep
over
their
dead
parent
,
with
none
to
attend
them
,
none
to
feed
them,--an
old
man
mourn
over
his
son
cut
off
in
his
prime
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
misery
and
distress
in
their
bad
form,--the
street
ring
with
shriek
and
groan
,
and
the
number
of
dead
so
great
that
it
be
impossible
to
carry
them
off
.
<EOS>
You
remember
Solomon
Eagle
's
prophecy
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
perfectly
,
"
reply
Leonard
;
"
and
I
lament
to
see
its
fulfilment
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
the
street

<EOS>
it
run

say
Rainbird

it

come
to

.
<EOS>
not

cart

now
as
green
as
the
field
without

as
silent

itself

<EOS>
terrible
time

as
I
say
before

terrible

<EOS>
the
dead

rot
in
heap
in
the
court

in
the
alley

in

house

no
one

remove
them

<EOS>
what
will
be
the
end
of
it
all
?
<EOS>
what
will
become
of
this
great
city

"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
difficult
to
foresee
what
will
become
of
it

reply
Leonard
,
"
unless
it
please
the
Lord
to
stay
his
vengeful
arm

and
something
whisper
in
my
ear
that
we
be
now
at
the
bad

<EOS>
the
scourge
can
not
exceed
its
present
violence
without
work
our

I

otherwise

though
I
would
fain
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
discern
no
symptom
of
abatement
of
the
distemper
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
an
evident
increase
of
malignity
,
and
such
be
the
opinion
of
all
I
have
speak
with
on
the
subject

<EOS>
chowle
tell
me
he
bury
two
hundred
more
yesterday

ever
do
before

yet
he
do
not
carry
a
third
of

dead
to
the
plague
-
pit

<EOS>
He
be
a
strange
fellow
that
Chowles
.
<EOS>
but
for
his
passion
for
his
horrible
calling
there
be
no
necessity
for
him

follow
it

he
be
now
one
of
the
rich
man
in
London

He

"
the

other

their
course
along

at

house
on

side
,
which
be
all
shut
up
,
with
the
fatal
red
cross

"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
echo
the
sentiment
,
and
fall
into
a
melancholy
train
of
reflection
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
more
than
once
remark
that
the
particular
day
now
under
consideration
be
the
one
in
which
the
plague
exercise
its
fierce
dominion
over
the
city
;
and
though
at
first
its
decline
be
as
imperceptible
as
the
gradual
diminution
of
the
day
after
the
long
have
pass
,
yet
still
the
alteration
begin
.
<EOS>
on
that
day
,
as
if
death
have
know
that
his
power
be
to
be
speedily
arrest
,
he
sharpen
his
fell
arrow
,
and
discharge
them
with
unerring
aim
.
<EOS>
to
pursue
the
course
of
the
destroyer
from
house
to
house
--
to
show
with
what
unrelenting
fury
he
assail
his
victim
--
to
describe
their
suffering
--
to
number
the
dead
left
within
their
bed
,
throw
into
the
street
,
or
convey
to
the
plague
-
pit
--
would
be
to
present
a
narrative
as
painful
as
revolt
.
<EOS>
on
this
terrible
night
it
be
as
hot
as
if
it
have
be
the
middle
of
June
.
<EOS>
no
air
be
stir
,
and
the
silence
be
so
profound
,
that
a
slight
noise
be
audible
at
a
great
distance
.
<EOS>
hush
in
the
seemingly
placid
repose
lie
the
great
city
,
while
hundred
of
its
inhabitant
be
groan
in
agony
,
or
breathe
their
last
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
on
reach
the
upper
end
of
Nicholas
-
lane
,
Rainbird
stand
still
for
a
moment
,
and
point
out
a
large
house
on
the
right
,
just
below
the
old
church
dedicate
to
the
saint
from
which
the
thoroughfare
take
its
name
.
<EOS>
They
be
about
to
proceed
towards
it
,
when
the
smith
again
pause
,
and
call
Leonard
's
attention
to
two
figure
quickly
advance
from
the
low
end
of
the
street
.
<EOS>
as
the
apprentice
and
his
companion
stand
in
the
shade
,
they
could
not
be
see
,
while
the
two
person
,
be
in
the
moonlight
,
be
fully
reveal
.
<EOS>
one
of
them
,
it
be
easy
to
perceive
,
be
Chowles
.
<EOS>
He
stop
before
the
door
of
his
dwelling
and
unfasten
it
,
and
while
he
be
thus
occupy
,
the
other
person
turn
his
face
so
as
to
catch
the
full
radiance
of
the
moon
,
disclose
the
feature
of
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
.
<EOS>
before
Leonard
recover
from
the
surprise
into
which
he
be
throw
by
this
unexpected
discovery
,
they
have
enter
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
hurry
forward
,
but
,
to
his
great
disappointment
,
find
the
door
lock
.
<EOS>
anxious
to
get
into
the
house
without
alarm
those
who
have
precede
him
,
he
glance
at
the
window
;
but
the
shutter
be
closed
and
strongly
bar
.
<EOS>
while
hesitate
what
to
do
,
Rainbird
come
up
,
and
guess
his
wish
,
tell
him
there
be
a
door
at
the
back
of
the
house
by
which
he
may
probably
gain
admittance
.
<EOS>
accordingly
they
hasten
down
a
passage
skirt
the
churchyard
,
which
bring
them
to
a
narrow
alley
lie
between
Nicholas
-
lane
and
Abchurch
-
lane
.
<EOS>
track
it
for
about
twenty
yard
,
Rainbird
pause
before
a
small
yard
-
door
,
and
try
the
latch
,
find
it
yielded
to
his
touch
.
 
<EOS>
cross
the
yard
,
they
come
to
another
door
.
<EOS>
It
be
lock
,
and
though
they
could
have
easily
burst
it
open
,
they
prefer
have
recourse
to
an
adjoin
window
,
the
shutter
of
which
,
be
carelessly
fasten
,
be
remove
without
noise
or
difficulty
.
<EOS>
in
another
moment
they
gain
a
small
dark
room
on
the
ground
-
floor
,
whence
they
issue
into
a
passage
,
<EOS>
where
,
to
their
great
joy
,
they
find
a
light
lantern
place
on
a
chair
.
<EOS>
Leonard
hastily
possess
himself
of
it
,
and
be
about
to
enter
a
room
on
the
left
when
his
companion
arrest
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
before
we
proceed
further
,
"
he
say
in
a
low
voice
,
"
I
must
know
what
you
be
about
to
do
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
purpose
will
be
explain
in
a
word
,
"
reply
the
apprentice
in
the
same
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
suspect
that
Nizza
Macascree
be
confine
here
by
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
and
Chowles
,
and
if
it
turn
out
I
be
right
in
my
conjecture
,
I
propose
to
liberate
her
.
<EOS>
Will
you
help
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Rainbird
,
"
I
do
not
much
fancy
the
job
.
<EOS>
however
,
since
I
be
here
,
I
will
not
go
back
.
<EOS>
I
be
curious
to
see
the
coffin
-
maker
's
hoard
.
<EOS>
look
at
yon
heap
of
clothe
.
<EOS>
there
be
velvet
doublet
and
silken
hose
enow
to
furnish
wardrobe
for
a
dozen
court
gallant
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
rich
as
the
stuff
be
,
I
would
not
put
the
good
of
them
on
for
all
the
wealth
of
London
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
nor
I
,
"
reply
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
make
free
,
however
,
with
a
sword
,
"
he
add
,
select
one
from
the
heap
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
need
a
weapon
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
require
nothing
more
than
my
halberd
,
"
observe
the
smith
;
"
and
I
would
advise
you
to
throw
away
that
velvet
scabbard
;
it
be
a
certain
harbour
for
infection
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
do
not
neglect
the
caution
,
and
push
open
the
door
,
they
enter
a
large
room
which
resemble
an
upholsterer
's
shop
,
be
literally
cram
with
chair
,
table
,
cabinet
,
moveable
cupboard
,
bedstead
,
curtain
,
and
hanging
,
all
of
the
rich
description
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
I
hear
be
true
,
"
observe
Rainbird
,
gaze
around
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
chowle
must
have
carry
off
every
thing
he
could
lay
hand
upon
.
<EOS>
what
can
he
do
with
all
that
furniture
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
the
miser
do
with
his
store
,
"
reply
Leonard
:
"
<EOS>
feast
his
eye
with
it
,
but
never
use
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
then
proceed
to
the
next
room
.
<EOS>
It
be
crowd
with
book
,
look
-
glass
,
and
picture
;
many
of
them
originally
of
great
value
,
but
greatly
damage
by
the
careless
manner
in
which
they
be
pile
one
upon
another
.
<EOS>
a
third
apartment
be
fill
with
flask
of
wine
,
with
cask
probably
contain
spirit
,
and
box
,
the
content
of
which
they
do
not
pause
to
examine
.
<EOS>
a
fourth
contain
male
and
female
habiliment
,
spread
out
like
the
dress
in
a
theatrical
wardrobe
.
<EOS>
Most
of
these
garment
be
of
the
gay
and
costliest
description
,
and
of
the
late
fashion
,
and
Leonard
sigh
as
he
look
upon
them
,
and
think
of
the
fate
of
those
they
have
so
lately
adorn
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
contagion
enough
in
those
clothe
to
infect
a
whole
city
,
"
say
Rainbird
,
who
regard
them
with
different
feeling
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
half
a
mind
to
set
fire
to
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
good
deed
to
do
so
,
"
return
Leonard
;
"
but
it
must
not
be
do
now
.
<EOS>
let
us
go
upstairs
.
<EOS>
these
be
the
only
room
below
.
"
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
they
ascend
the
staircase
,
and
enter
chamber
after
chamber
,
all
of
which
be
as
full
of
spoil
as
those
they
have
just
visit
;
but
they
could
find
no
one
,
nor
be
there
any
symptom
that
the
house
be
tenant
.
<EOS>
They
next
stand
still
within
the
gallery
,
and
listen
intently
for
some
sound
to
reveal
those
they
seek
,
but
all
be
still
and
silent
as
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
can
not
be
mistake
,
"
observe
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
clear
this
house
be
the
receptacle
for
Chowles
's
plunder
.
<EOS>
besides
,
we
should
not
have
find
the
lantern
burn
if
they
have
go
forth
again
.
<EOS>
no
,
no
;
they
must
be
hide
somewhere
,
and
I
will
not
quit
the
place
till
I
find
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Their
search
,
however
,
be
fruitless
.
<EOS>
They
mount
to
the
garret
,
open
every
door
,
and
glance
into
every
corner
.
<EOS>
still
,
no
one
be
to
be
see
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
think
Nizza
can
not
be
here
,
"
say
the
apprentice
;
"
but
I
be
resolve
not
to
depart
without
question
chowle
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
find
him
first
,
"
rejoin
Rainbird
.
<EOS>
"
if
he
be
anywhere
,
he
must
be
in
the
cellar
,
for
we
have
be
into
every
room
in
this
part
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
think
you
have
better
abandon
the
search
altogether
.
<EOS>
no
good
will
come
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
,
however
,
be
not
to
be
dissuade
,
and
they
go
downstairs
.
<EOS>
a
short
flight
of
stone
step
bring
them
to
a
spacious
kitchen
,
but
it
be
quite
empty
,
and
seem
to
have
be
long
disuse
.
<EOS>
They
then
peep
into
the
scullery
adjoining
,
and
be
about
to
retrace
their
step
,
when
Rainbird
pluck
Leonard
's
sleeve
to
call
attention
to
a
gleam
of
light
issue
from
a
door
which
stand
partly
ajar
,
in
a
long
narrow
passage
lead
apparently
to
the
cellar
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
be
there
,
"
he
say
,
in
a
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
"
so
I
see
,
"
reply
Leonard
,
in
the
same
tone
.
<EOS>
and
raise
his
finger
to
his
lip
in
token
of
silence
,
he
steal
forward
on
the
point
of
his
foot
and
cautiously
open
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
further
end
of
the
cellar
--
for
such
it
be
--
knelt
Chowles
,
examine
with
greedy
eye
the
content
of
a
large
chest
,
which
,
from
the
hasty
glance
that
Leonard
catch
of
it
,
appear
to
be
fill
with
gold
and
silver
plate
.
<EOS>
a
link
stick
against
the
wall
throw
a
strong
light
over
the
scene
,
and
show
that
the
coffin
-
maker
be
alone
.
<EOS>
as
Leonard
advance
,
the
sound
of
his
footstep
catch
Chowles
's
ear
,
and
utter
a
cry
of
surprise
and
alarm
,
he
let
fall
the
lid
of
the
chest
,
and
spring
to
his
foot
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
he
cry
,
look
uneasily
round
,
as
if
in
search
of
some
weapon
.
"
<EOS>
be
you
come
to
rob
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no

"
reply
Leonard
;
<EOS>
"
neither
be
we
come
to
reclaim
the
plunder
you
have
take
from
other

<EOS>
We
be
come
in
search
of
Nizza
Macascree

<EOS>
"
then
you
have
come
on
a
fool
's
errand

reply
Chowles
,
regain
his
courage
,
"
<EOS>
for
she
be
not
here

I

into
a
third

they
perceive
the
poor
girl

on
a
couch

in
a
recess
at
one
side

<EOS>
She
hear
their
footstep
,
and
without

her
head
,
or
look
towards
them
,
say
,
in
a
weak
but
determined
<EOS>
voice--"Tell
your
master

I
will
see
him
no

<EOS>
the
plague

glad
of
it

It

"
It

Leonard

<EOS>
the
poor
girl
start
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
,
and
raise
herself
on
one
arm
,
look
wildly
towards
him
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
be
satisfied
that
her
fancy
do
not
deceive
her
,
she
utter
a
cry
of
delight
,
and
fall
backwards
on
the
couch

insensible

she
speedily
open
her
eye

fix
them
tenderly
and
inquiringly
on
the
apprentice

<EOS>
before
reply
to
her
mute
interrogatory
,
Leonard
request
the
old
woman
to
leave
them
--
an
order
very
reluctantly
obey
--
and
as
soon
as
they
be
leave
alone
,
proceed
to
explain
,
as
briefly
as
he
could
,
the
manner
in
which
he
have

her
place

captivity

<EOS>
Nizza
listen
to
his
recital
with
the
great
interest

and
though
evidently
suffer
acute
pain
,
utter
no
complaint

endeavour
to
assume
an
appearance
of
composure
and
tranquillity

<EOS>
"
I

upon
the
persecution

the

<EOS>
"
You

Leonard

while
I

my
situation

night

the
key

the

<EOS>

the
device

Leonard

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
,
why
--
why
do
you
trust
her

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
could
I
do
?
"
rejoin
Nizza

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
to
stay
be
as
bad
as
to
fly
,
and
may
have
be
bad

<EOS>
at
all
event
,
I
have
no
distrust

<EOS>
My
companion
open
the
gate
,
and
call
to
some
person
without
.
<EOS>
It
be
profoundly
dark
;
but
I
could
perceive
a
carriage
,
or
some
other
vehicle
,
at
a
little
distance

<EOS>
alarm
at
the
sight
,
I
whisper
my
fear
to
my
companion

and
would
have
retreat
;
but
she
lay
hold
of
my
hand
,
and
detain
me
.
<EOS>
the
next
moment
I
feel
a
rude
grasp
upon
my
arm

<EOS>
before
I
could
cry
out
,
a
hand
be
place
over
my
mouth
so
closely
as
almost
to
stifle
me
;
and
I
be
force
into
the
carriage
by
two
person
,
who
seat
themselves
on
either
side
of
me
,
threaten
to
put
me
to
death
if
I
make
the
slight
noise

<EOS>
the
carriage
be
then
drive
off
at
a
furious
pace
.
<EOS>
for
some
mile
it
pursue
the
high
road
,
and
then
strike
into
a
lane
,
where
,
in
consequence
of
the
deep
and
dangerous
rut

the
driver

oblige
to
relax
his
speed

in

<EOS>
no
injury

either
by
me

the
door

open
without
much
difficulty

out

one
of

captor
keep
near
me
,
while
the
other
lend
his
assistance
to
the
coachman
to
set
the
carriage
to
right

<EOS>
It
prove
,
however
,
to
be
so
much
damage

that
it
could
not

;
and
,
after
considerable
delay
,
my
conductor
order
the
coachman
to
remain
with
it
till
further
assistance
could
be
send
;

,
take
the
horse

me
beside

gallop
off

<EOS>
have
ride
about
five
mile
,
we
cross
an
extensive
common
,

pass
an
avenue
of
tree
,
which
bring
us
to
the
entrance
of
an
old
house

<EOS>
Our
arrival
seem
to
be
expect
;
for
the
instant
we
appear
,
the
gate
be
open
,
and
the
old
woman
you
have
just
see
,
and
who
be
call
Mrs.
Carteret
,
together
with
a
dumb
African
,
name
Hassan

appear
at
it

<EOS>
some
muttered
discourse
pass
between
my
conductor

these
person

which
end
in
my
be
commit
to
the
care
of
Mrs.
Carteret
who
lead
me
upstairs
to
a
richly
-
furnished
chamber

urge
me
to
take
some
refreshment
before
I
retire
to
rest

,
however

I
decline

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
still
,
you
see
nothing
of
Sir
Paul
Parravicin

"
ask
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
on
go
downstairs
next
morning
,
he
be
the
first
person
I
beheld

reply
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
fall
upon
his
knee
,
he
implore
my
pardon
for
the
artifice

have
practise
,
and
say
he
have
be
compel
to
have
recourse
to
it
in
order
to
save
me
from
the
king

<EOS>
He
then
begin
to
plead
his
own
suit
;
but
find
his
protestation
of
passion
of
no
effect
,
he
become
yet
more
importunate
;
when
,
at
this
juncture
,
one
of
the
man
who
have
act
as
my
conductor
on
the
previous
night
suddenly
enter
the
room
,
and
tell
him
he
must
return
to
Oxford
without
an
instant

delay

as
the
king

attendant
be
in
search
of
him

<EOS>
cast
a
look
at
me
that
make
me
tremble
,
he
then
depart
;
and
though
I
remain
more
than
two
month
in
that
house
,
I
see
nothing
more
of
him

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
not

to
escape
during
that
time

ask
Leonard

<EOS>
"
I
be
so
carefully

by
Mrs.
Carteret

she
reply

"
about
a
week
ago
,
the
two
man
who
have
conduct

tell
me
I
must
accompany
them
to
London

<EOS>
I
attempt
no

aware
it
would
be
useless

as
the
journey
be

road

three
day
elapse

We
arrive
at
night

I
almost

my
own
alarm
in
the
terrible
sight
I
beheld
at
every
turn

<EOS>
It
would
have
be
useless
to
call
out
for
assistance
,
for
there
be
no
one
to
afford
it

I
ask
my
conductor
if

sternly

He
then
renew
his
odious
solicitation

I
resist
him
as
firmly
as

he
be
more
determined

I
may
have
be
reduce
to
the

for
your

the
piper

always
treat
me
with
the
kindness
of
a

it
now
seem
the

want

tell
me
your
reason

<EOS>
as
Leonard
be
about
to

the
door
be
open
by
Mrs.

who
say
that
Sir
Paul
Parravicin

just
return

Doctor
Hodges

another
gentleman

<EOS>
the
word
be
scarcely
utter
,
when
Thirlby
rush
into
the
room
,
and
,
fling
himself
on
his
knee
before
the
couch
,
cry
,
"
at
last
<EOS>
I
have
find
you
--
my
child

<EOS>
my
child

"
<EOS>
the
surprise
which
Nizza
must
have
experience
at
such
an
address
be
materially
lessen
by
what
Leonard
have
just
tell
her
;
and
,
after
earnestly
regard
the
stranger
for
some
time

she
exclaim
,
in

gentle
voice

My
father

Thirlby
spring
to
his
foot

would
have
fold
her

have
reach

have
not

rejoin
Thirlby

<EOS>
"
the
gratification
would
be
cheaply
purchase
at
the
price
of
my
life

if
I
could
preserve
her

the
sacrifice

I
would
gladly
make
it

"
 
<EOS>
"
no
more
of

cry
Hodges
,
impatiently
,
"
or
you
will
defeat
any

I
may
make
to
cure
her

<EOS>
You
have
well
not

<EOS>
Your
presence
agitate
her

<EOS>
gaze
wistfully
at
his
daughter
,
and
scarcely
able
to
tear
himself
away
,
Thirlby
yield
at
last
to
the
doctor
's
advice
,
and
quit
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
be
follow
by
Leonard
,
who
receive
a
hint
to
the
same
effect
.
<EOS>
on
reach
the
adjoining
room
,
they
find
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
walk
to
and
fro
in
an
agitated
manner
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
come
up
to
Thirlby
,
and
,
in
an
anxious
but
deferential
tone
,
inquire
how
he
have
find
Nizza
?
<EOS>
the
latter
shake
his
head
,
and
,
sternly
decline
any
further
conversation
,
pass
on
with
the
apprentice
to
an
outer
room
.
<EOS>
He
then
fling
himself
into
a
chair
,
and
appear
lose
in
deep
and
bitter
reflection
.
<EOS>
Leonard
be
unwilling
to
disturb
him
;
but
at
last
his
own
anxiety
compel
him
to
break
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can
you
tell
me
aught
of
Amabel
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
 
<EOS>
"
alas
!
<EOS>
no
,
"
reply
Thirlby
,
rouse
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
have
no
time
to
inquire
about
her
,
as
you
shall
hear
.
<EOS>
after
leave
you
on
the
bridge
,
I
go
into
Southwark
,
and
hurry
through
all
the
principal
street
,
inquire
from
every
watchman
I
meet
whether
he
have
see
any
person
answer
to
Doctor
Hodges
's
description
,
but
could
hear
nothing
of
him
.
<EOS>
at
last
I
give
up
the
quest
,
and
,
retrace
my
step
,
be
proceed
along
Cannon
-
street
,
when
I
descry
a
person
a
little
in
advance
of
me
,
whom
I
think
must
be
the
doctor
,

I

when
two

corner
of
Nicholas

on

<EOS>
It
be
Sir
Paul
Parravicin

and
he
instantly
explain
his
errand
.
<EOS>
imagine
the
feeling
with
which
I
hear
his
account
of
the
illness
of
my
daughter

<EOS>
imagine
,
also
,
the
horror
I
must
have
experience

<EOS>
the
sentence
be
not
complete
,
for
at
that
moment
the
door
be
open
by
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
,
who
,
advance
towards
Thirlby
,
beg
,
in
the
same
deferential
tone
as
before
,
to
have
a
few
word
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
may
well
refuse
you
,
"
reply
Thirlby
,
sternly
,
"
but
it
be
necessary
we
should
have
some
explanation
of
what
have
occur

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be

rejoin
Parravicin
,
"
and
,
therefore
,
I
have
seek
you
.
"
<EOS>
Thirlby
arise
,
and
accompany
the
knight
into
the
outer
room
,
close
the
door
after
him
.
<EOS>
More
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
--
it
seem
an
age
to
Leonard
--
elapse
,
and
still
no
one
come
.
<EOS>
listen
intently
,
he
hear
voice
in
the
next
room
.
<EOS>
They
be
loud
and
angry
,
as
if
in
quarrel
.
<EOS>
then
all
be
quiet
,
and
at
last
Thirlby
reappear
,
and
take
his
seat
beside
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
you
see
Doctor
Hodges
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
the
apprentice
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
"
reply
<EOS>
Thirlby--"and
he
speak
favourably
of
my
poor
child
.
<EOS>
He
have
administer
all
needful
remedy
,
but
as
it
be
necessary
to
watch
their
effect
,
he
will
remain
with
her
some
time
longer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
,
meanwhile
,
I
shall
know
nothing
of
Amabel
,
"
cry
Leonard
,
in
a
tone
of
bitter
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
anxiety
be
natural
,
"
return
Thirlby
,
"
but
you
may
rest
satisfied
,
if
Doctor
Hodges
have
see
her
,
he
have
do
all
that
human
aid
can
effect
.
<EOS>
but
as
you
must
perforce
wait
his
come
forth
,
I
will
endeavour
to
beguile
the
tedious
interval
by
relate
to
you
so
much
of
my
history
as
refer
to
Nizza
Macascree
.
"
 
<EOS>
after
a
brief
pause
,
he
commence
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
know
,
then
,
that
in
my
youth
I
become
desperately
enamour
of
a
lady
name
Isabella
Morley
.
<EOS>
She
be
most
beautiful
--
but
I
need
not
enlarge
upon
her
attraction
,
since
you
have
behold
her
very
image
in
Nizza
.
<EOS>
when
I
first
meet
her
she
be
attach
to
another
,
but
I
soon
rid
myself
of
my
rival
.
<EOS>
I
quarrel
with
him
,
and
slay
him
in
a
duel
.
<EOS>
after
a
long
and
urgent
suit
,
for
the
successful
issue
of
which
I
be
mainly
indebted
to
my
rank
and
wealth
,
which
give
great
influence
with
her
parent
,
Isabella
become
mine
.
<EOS>
but
I
soon
find
out
she
do
not
love
me
.
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
discovery
,
I
become
madly
jealous
,
and
embitter
her
life
and
my
own
by
constant
,
and
,
now
I
know
too
well
,
groundless
suspicion
.
<EOS>
She
have
bear
me
a
son
,
and
in
the
excess
of
my
jealous
fury
,
fancy
the
child
be
not
my
own
,
I
threaten
to
put
it
to
death
.
<EOS>
this
violence
lead
to
the
unhappy
result
I
be
about
to
relate
.
<EOS>
another
child
be
bear
,
a
daughter
--
need
I
say
Nizza
,
or
to
give
her
her
proper
name
,
Isabella
,
for
she
be
so
christened
after
her
mother
--
and
<EOS>
one
night
--
one
luckless
night,--maddene
by
some
causeless
doubt
,
I
snatch
the
innocent
babe
from
her
mother
's
arm
,
and
if
I
have
not
be
prevent
by
the
attendant
,
who
rush
into
the
room
on
hear
their
mistress
's
shriek
,
should
have
destroy
her
.
<EOS>
after
awhile
,
I
become
pacified
,
and
on
review
my
conduct
more
calmly
on
the
morrow
,
bitterly
reproach
myself
,
and
hasten
to
express
my
penitence
to
my
wife
.
'
<EOS>
You
will
never
have
an
opportunity
of
repeat
your
violence
,
'
she
say
;
'
the
object
of
your
cruel
and
unfounded
suspicion
be
go
.
<EOS>
'--'gone
!
<EOS>
'
<EOS>
I
exclaim
;
'
whither
?
'
<EOS>
and
as
I
speak
I
look
around
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
but
the
babe
be
nowhere
to
be
see
.
<EOS>
in
answer
to
my
inquiry
,
my
wife
admit
that
she
have
cause
her
to
be
remove
to
a
place
of
safety
,
but
refuse
,
even
on
my
most
urgent
entreaty
,
accompany
by
promise
of
amend
conduct
,
to
tell
me
where
.
<EOS>
I
next
interrogate
the
servant
,
but
they
profess
entire
ignorance
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
for
three
whole
day
I
make
ineffectual
search
for
the
child
,
and
offer
large
reward
to
any
one
who
would
bring
her
to
me
.
<EOS>
but
they
fail
to
produce
her
;
and
repair
to
my
wife
's
chamber
,
I
threaten
her
with
the
most
terrible
consequence
if
she
persist
in
her
vindictive
project
.
<EOS>
She
defy
me
,
and
,
transport
with
rage
<EOS>
,
I
pass
my
sword
through
her
body
,
exclaim
as
I
deal
the
murderous
blow
,
'
You
have
send
the
brat
to
her
father
--
to
your
lover
,
madam
.
'
<EOS>
Horror
and
remorse
seize
me
the
moment
I
have
commit
the
ruthless
act
,
and
I
should
have
turn
my
sword
against
myself
,
if
I
have
not
be
stay
by
the
cry
of
my
poor
victim
,
who
implore
me
to
hold
my
hand
.
'
<EOS>
do
not
add
crime
to
crime
,
'
she
cry
;
'
you
have
do
me
grievous
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
,
indeed
,
love
you
,
because
my
affection
be
not
under
my
control
,
but
I
have
be
ever
true
to
you
,
and
this
I
declare
with
my
late
breath
.
<EOS>
I
freely
forgive
you
,
and
pray
God
to
turn
your
heart
.
'
<EOS>
and
with
these
word
she
expire
.
<EOS>
I
be
rouse
from
the
stupefaction
into
which
I
be
throw
by
the
appearance
of
the
servant
.
<EOS>
heap
execration
upon
me
,
they
strove
to
seize
me
;
but
I
break
through
them
,
and
gain
a
garden
at
the
back
of
my
mansion
,
which
be
situate
on
the
bank
of
the
Thames

not
far
from
Chelsea

<EOS>
this
garden
run
down
to
the
river
side
,
and
be
defend
by
a
low
wall

which
I
leapt
,
and
plunge
into
the
stream

<EOS>
a
boat

instantly
send
in
pursuit
of
me

and
a
number
of
person
run
along
the
bank

all
eager
for
my
capture

<EOS>
but
be
an
excellent
swimmer

I
try
to
elude
them

and
as
I
never
appear
again
,
it
be
suppose
I
be

and
Nizza
,
or
as
I
ought
now
to
call

his
young
day

and
the
amulet
I
myself
have

remark
Leonard

<EOS>

to
resume
my

I
then
pass
over
into
Holland

in
the
course

time

and
he
cover
his
face
with
his
hand
to
hide
his
emotion

after
awhile
he
proceed
:
 
"
have
pass
many
year

as
peacefully

up

too
happy!--until

why
should
I
relate
the
rest

my
sad

he
add
,
in
a
voice
suffocate
with
emotion--"you

it
as
well

I

You
say

over
his

on

to
him
through
Judith

return
Thirlby
;

and
I
lament
to
own
<EOS>
I
be
his
father

<EOS>
when
among
his
worthless
associates,--nay
,
even
with
the
king
--
he
drop
the
high
title
,
and
assume
that
by
which
you
have
know
him
;
and
it
be
well
he
do
so
,
for
his
action
be
sufficient
to
tarnish
a
far
noble
name
than
that
he
bear

<EOS>
owe
to
this
disguise
I
know
not
he
be
the
person
who
carry
off
my
daughter

<EOS>
but
,
thank
Heaven
,
another
and
fouler
crime
have
be
spare
us

<EOS>
all
these
thing
have
be
strangely
explain
to
me
to

night

<EOS>
and
thus
,
you
see
,
young
man
,
the
poor
piper
's
daughter
turn
out
to
be
the
Lady
Isabella
Argentine

<EOS>
"
before
an
answer
could
be
return
,
the
door
be
open
by
Hodges
,
and
both
start
to
their
foot
,
hurried
towards
him

<EOS>
IV
.
 
<EOS>
the
trial
of
AMABEL
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
now
be
necessary
to
return
to
the
period
of
Amabel
's
abduction
from
Kingston
Lisle
.
<EOS>
the
shawl
throw
over
her
head
prevent
her
cry
from
be
hear
;
and
,
notwithstanding
her
struggle
,
she
be
place
on
horseback
before
a
powerful
man
,
who
gallop
off
with
her
along
the
wantage
-
road
.
<EOS>
after
proceed
at
a
rapid
pace
for
about
two
mile
,
her
conductor
come
to
a
halt
,
and
she
could
distinguish
the
sound
of
other
horseman
approach
.
<EOS>
at
first
she
hope
it
may
prove
a
rescue
;
but
she
be
quickly
undeceived
.
<EOS>
the
shawl
be
remove
,
and
she
behold
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
accompany
by
Pillichody
,
and
some
half
-
dozen
mount
attendant
.
<EOS>
the
earl
would
have
transfer
her
to
his
own
steed
,
but
she
offer
such
determined
resistance
to
the
arrangement
,
that
he
be
compel
to
content
himself
with
ride
by
her
aide
.
<EOS>
all
his
effort
to
engage
her
in
conversation
be
equally
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
She
make
no
reply
to
his
remark
,
but
avert
her
gaze
from
him
;
and
,
whenever
he
approach
,
shrink
from
him
with
abhorrence
.
<EOS>
the
earl
,
however
,
be
not
easily
repulse
,
but
continue
his
attention
and
discourse
,
as
if
both
have
be
favourably
receive
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
way
they
proceed
for
some
mile
,
one
of
the
earl
's
attendant
,
who
be
well
acquaint
with
the
country
,
be
in
fact
a
native
of
it
,
serve
as
their
guide
.
<EOS>
They
have
quit
the
Wantage
-
road
,
and
leave
that
ancient
town
,
renowne
as
the
birthplace
of
the
great
Alfred
,
on
the
right
,
have
take
the
direction
of
Abingdon
and
Oxford
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
lovely
evening
,
and
their
course
lead
them
through
many
charming
place
.
<EOS>
but
the
dreary
waste
would
have
be
as
agreeable
as
the
rich
prospect
to
Amabel
.
<EOS>
She
note
neither
the
broad
meadow
,
yet
white
from
the
scythe
,
nor
the
cornfield
wave
with
their
deep
and
abundant
,
though
yet
immature
crop
;
nor
do
she
cast
even
a
pass
glance
at
any
one
of
those
green
spot
which
every
lane
offer
,
and
upon
which
the
eye
of
the
traveller
ordinarily
delight
to
linger
.
<EOS>
She
ride
beneath
a
natural
avenue
of
tree
,
whose
branch
meet
overhead
like
the
arch
of
a
cathedral
,
and
be
scarcely
conscious
of
their
pleasant
shade
.
<EOS>
She
hear
neither
the
song
of
the
woo
thrush
,
nor
the
cry
of
the
startled
blackbird
,
nor
the
evening
hymn
of
the
soar
lark
.
<EOS>
alike
to
her
be
the
gorse
-
cover
common
,
along
which
they
swiftly
speed
,
and
the
steep
hill
-
side
up
which
they
more
swiftly
mount
.
<EOS>
She
breathe
not
the
delicious
fragrance
of
the
new
-
mown
hay
,
nor
listen
to
the
distant
lowing
herd
,
the
bleating
sheep
,
or
the
cawing
rook
.
<EOS>
She
think
of
nothing
but
her
perilous
situation,--heard
nothing
but
the
voice
of
Rochester,--felt
nothing
but
the
terror
inspire
by
his
presence
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
earl
do
not
desire
to
pass
through
any
village
,
if
he
could
help
it
,
his
guide
lead
him
along
the
most
unfrequented
road
;

ask
the
earl

half
angrily

V.
 
<EOS>
the
MARRIAGE
and
its
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
unwilling
to
believe
he
have
become
an
object
of
aversion
to
Amabel
,
Rochester
renew
his
solicitation
on
the
follow
day
,
and
call
into
play
his
utmost
fascination
of
manner
,
endeavour
to
remove
any
ill
impression
produce
by
his
previous
violence
.
<EOS>
She
be
proof
,
however
,
against
his
art
;
and
though
he
never
lose
his
mastery
over
himself
,
he
have
some
difficulty
in
conceal
his
chagrin
at
the
result
of
the
interview
.
<EOS>
He
now
begin
to
adopt
a
different
course
,
and
enter
into
long
discussion
with
Amabel
,
strove
by
every
effort
of
wit
and
ridicule
,
to
shake
and
subvert
her
moral
and
religious
principle
.
<EOS>
but
here
again
he
fail
;
and
once
more
shift
his
ground
,
affect
to
be
convince
by
her
argument
.
<EOS>
He
entirely
alter
his
demeanour
,
and
though
Amabel
could
not
put
much
faith
in
the
change
,
it
be
a
subject
of
real
rejoice
to
her
.
<EOS>
though
scarcely
conscious
of
it
herself
,
he
sensibly
win
upon
her
regard
,
and
she
pass
many
hour
of
each
day
in
his
society
without
find
it
irksome
.
<EOS>
see
the
advantage
he
have
gain
,
and
well
aware
that
he
should
lose
it
by
the
slight
indiscretion
,
Rochester
act
with
the
great
caution
.
<EOS>
the
more
at
ease
she
feel
with
him
,
the
more
deferential
do
he
become
;
and
before
she
be
conscious
of
her
danger
,
the
poor
girl
be
once
more
on
the
brink
of
the
precipice
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
about
this
time
that
Leonard
Holt
,
as
have
be
previously
intimate
,
discover
her
retreat
,
and
contrive
,
by
clamber
up
a
pear
-
tree
which
be
nail
against
the
wall
of
the
house
,
to
reach

<EOS>

receive
her
assurance
that
she

all
Rochester
's
importunity
,
the
apprentice
promise
to
return
on
the
following
night
with
mean
to
affect
her
liberation
,
and
depart
.
<EOS>
fully
persuade
that
she
could
now
repose
confidence
in
the
earl
,
Amabel
acquaint
him
,
the
next
morning
,
with
Leonard
's
visit
,
add
that
he
would
now
have
an
opportunity
of
prove
the
sincerity
of
his
profession
by
deliver
her
up
to
her
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
since
you
desire
it
,
"
reply
the
earl
,
who
hear
her
with
an
unmoved
countenance
,
though
internally

with
passion
,
"
I
will
convey
you
to
your
father
myself
.
<EOS>
I
have
hope
,
"
he
add
with
a
sigh
,
"
that
we
should
never
part
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
I
have
be
mistake
in
you
,
my
lord
,
"
rejoin
Amabel
,
half
-
repent
her
frankness
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
so
,
"
he
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
anything
you
require
,
except
deliver
you
to
this
hateful
apprentice
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
your
pleasure
,
I
repeat
,
I
will
take
you
back
to
your
father
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
promise
me
this
,
my
lord
,
and
I
shall
be
quite
easy
,
"
cry
Amabel
,
joyfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
promise
it
,
"
he
return
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
oh
!
<EOS>
why
not
stay
with
me
,
and
complete
the
good
work
you
have

?
"
 
<EOS>
Amabel
avert
her
head
,
and
Rochester
sigh
deeply
,
quit
the
room
.
<EOS>
an
attendant

afterwards
come
to
inform
her
that
the
earl
intend
to
start
for
London
without
delay
,
and
beg
her
to
prepare
for
the
journey
.
<EOS>
in
an
hour
's
time
,

carriage

to
the
door
,
and
Rochester
have
place
her
and
Prudence
in
it
,

his
horse
,
and
set
forth
.
<EOS>
late
on
the
second
day
they
arrive
in
London
,
and
pass
through
the
silent
and
deserted
street
,
the
aspect
of
which
strike
terror
into
all
the
party
,
shape
their
course
towards
the
city
.
<EOS>
presently
they
reach
Ludgate
,
but
instead
of

to
wood
-
street
,
the
carriage
turn
off
on
the
right
,
and
traverse
Thames
-
street
,
cross
London
Bridge
.
<EOS>
Amabel
could
obtain
no
explanation
of
this
change
from
Prudence
;
and
her
uneasiness
be
not
diminish
when
the
vehicle
,
which
be
drive
down
a
narrow
street
on
the
left
immediately
after
quit
the

,

at
the
entrance
of
a
large

yard
.
<EOS>
Rochester
,
who
have
already
dismount
,
assist
her
to
alight
,
and
in
answer
to
her
hasty
inquiry
why
he
have
bring
her
thither
,
tell
her
he
think
it
better
to
defer
take

be
content
with
this
excuse
,
she
be
lead
into
the
house
,
severely
reproach
herself
for
her
indiscretion
.
<EOS>
nothing
,
however
,
occur
to
alarm
her
that
night
.
<EOS>
the
earl
be
even
more
deferential
than
before
,
and
assure
her
he
would
fulfil
his
promise
in
the
morning
,
confide
her
to
Prudence
.
 
<EOS>
the
house
whither
she
have
be
bring
be
large
and
old
-
fashioned
.
<EOS>
the
room
have
once
be
magnificently
fit
up
,
but
the
hanging
and
furniture
be
much
fade
,
and
have
a
gloomy
and
neglect
air
.
<EOS>
this
be
especially
observable
in
the
sleep
-
chamber
appoint
for
her
reception
.
<EOS>
It
be
large
and
lofty

with
black
and

and
be
fill
with
cumbrous
chest
and
cabinet
,
and
antique
high
-
back
chair
.
<EOS>
but
the
most
noticeable
object
be
a
large
state
-
bed
,
with
a
heavy
square
canopy
,
cover
,
with
the
rich
damask
,
weave
with
gold
,
and

of
the

and
tarnish

"
I

to
Prudence

to
compose
herself
,
she

and
open
the
window
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
serene
and
beautiful
night
,
and
she
could
see
the
smooth
river
sparkling
in
the
starlight
,
and
flow
at
a
hundred
yard
'
distance
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
.
<EOS>
beyond
,
she
could
indistinctly
perceive
the
outline
of
the
mighty
city
,
while
nearer
,
on
the
left
,
lie
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
solemnly
across
the
water
come
the
sound
of
innumerable
bell

toll
for
those
who
have
die
of
the
plague
,
and
be
now
be
bear
to
their
last
home
.
<EOS>
while
listen
to
these
sad
sound
,
another
,
but
more
doleful
and
appalling
noise
,
catch
her
ear
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
rumbling
of
cart
-
wheel
in
the
adjoining
street
,
accompany
by
the
ringing
of
a
hand

bell
,
while
a

break
before

and

a
slumber

It

time
so
dreadful

treachery
rush
upon

infinitely
more
anguish

bodily
pain

She
bedew
the

have
be
equally
unsuccessful
in

first
in

direction
and
then
in

of

as
soon
as

,
the
earl
tell
him
all
that
have
occur
,
and
besought
him
to
accompany

to
the
poor
sufferer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
to

,
"
say
Hodges
,
who
have
listen
to
the
recital
with
mixed
feeling
of
sorrow
and
indignation
,
"
on
one
condition
--
and
one
only
--
namely
,
that
your
lordship
do
not
see
her
again
without
my

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
demand

<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
give

,
"
return
Hodges
;
"
but
I
will
only
go
upon
such
term
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
I
must
perforce
submit
,
"
reply
the
earl
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
entreat
you
to
set

<EOS>
"
Your

"
<EOS>
He
then
open
the
door
,
reiterate
the
term
upon
which
alone
he
would
attend
,
and
the
earl
depart
.
 
<EOS>
shortly
afterwards
he
set
out
,
and
make

<EOS>
She
exhibit
much
pleasure
at
see
him
,
and
look
round
,
as
if
in
search
of
the
earl

<EOS>
guess
her
meaning
,
the
physician
,
who
now
begin
to

the
interdiction
he
have
place
upon
him
,

her
that

the
cause
of
his
absence

<EOS>
"
It
be

"
she
murmured--"well

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
then
make
some
inquiry
after
her
relative
,
and
receive
a
satisfactory
answer
,
say
,
"
I
be
glad

<EOS>
You

It
will
be
a

reply
hodge
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
long
have

"
ask
Amabel
,
somewhat
quickly
.
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
"
I

"
she
reply
;
and
join
her
hand
upon
her
breast
,
she
begin
to
murmur
a
prayer
.
 
<EOS>
Hodges
,
who
up
to
this
moment
have
have
some
difficulty
in
repress
his
emotion
,
withdraw
to
a
short
distance
to
hide
his
fast

fall
tear
.
<EOS>
He
be
rouse
shortly
after
,
by
a
sudden
and
startling
cry
from
the
old

<EOS>
the
eye

be
close

<EOS>
there
be
a
slight
quiver
of
the
lip
,
as
if
she

probably

and
then
all
be

<EOS>
Hodges

at

<EOS>
It
will
not
be
necessary
to
recapitulate
what
subsequently

<EOS>
We
shall

therefore
,
proceed
to

point
of
time
when

and
enter
the

where

He

<EOS>
Leonard

room
,
and
make
his
way
,
he

how
,
into
the
street

<EOS>
His
brain
seem
on
fire

and
he

so
quickly
that
his

<EOS>
the

and
two

evidently

from
their

They

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
the
man
proceed
with
their

inscription

<EOS>
before

<EOS>
the
foremost
burier
carry
a
lantern
,
but
he
hold
it
so
low
that
its
light
do
not
fall
upon
his
burden
.
<EOS>
Leonard
,
however
,
do
not
require
to
see
the
body
to
know
whose
it
be
.
<EOS>
the
moon
be
at
its
full
,
and
shed
a
ghastly
light
over
the
group
,
and
a
large
bat

round
the

<EOS>
on

<EOS>
"
You

reply
chowle

<EOS>
"
I
wonder

<EOS>
as
he
speak
,
he
hold
up
his
lantern

and
unfasten

,
throw
the
light
full
upon

<EOS>
the
feature

pale
as
marble

calm

their
expression

like
those

in
placid
slumber

<EOS>
the
long
fair
hair
hang
over
the
side
of
the
board

<EOS>
It
be
a
sad
and
touching
sight
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
as
I
be
a
live
man

it
be
the
grocer

Amabel,--somewhile

<EOS>
"
It

suddenly
rush
from
behind
a
building
where
he
have
hitherto

<EOS>
"
whither

he
add
to
Rochester
,
as
his
injunction
be
obeyed--"oppose

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
I.
 
<EOS>
the
decline
of
the
PLAGUE
.
 
<EOS>
More
than
two
month
must
be
pass
over
in
silence
.
<EOS>
during
that
time
,
the
pestilence
have
so
greatly
abate
as
no
longer
to
occasion
alarm
to
those
who
have
escape
its
ravage
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
mention
that
the
distemper
arrive
at
its
height
about
the
10th
of
September
,
and
though
for
the
two
follow
week
the
decline
be
scarcely
perceptible
,
yet
it
have
already
commence
.
<EOS>
on
the
last
week
in
that
fatal
month
,
when
all
hope
have
be
abandon
,
the
bill
of
mortality
suddenly
decrease
in
number
to
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
thirty
-
four
.
<EOS>
and
this
fortunate
change
could
not
be
attribute
to
the
want
of
material
to
act
upon
,
for
the
sick
continue
as
numerous
as
before
,
while
the
death
be
less
frequent
.
<EOS>
in
the
next
week
there
be
a
further
decrease
of
six
hundred
;
in
the
next
after
that
of
six
hundred
;
and
so
on
till
the
end
of
October
,
when
,
the
cold
weather
set
in
,
the
amount
be
reduce
to
nearly
one
thousand
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
,
when
the
distemper
begin
to
lose
somewhat
of
its
malignancy
,
a
few
scared
individual
appear
in
the
street
,
but
carefully
shun
each
other
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
day
,
however
,
considerable
number
join
them
,
and
for
the
first
time
for
nearly
three
month
there
be
something
like
life
abroad
.
<EOS>
It
be
astonish
how
soon
hope
and
confidence
be
revive
.
<EOS>
now
that
it
could
no
longer
be
doubt
that
the
plague
be
on
the
decline
,
it
seem
as
if
a
miracle
have
be
perform
in
favour
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
house
be
open
--
shopkeeper
resume
their
business
--
and
it
be
a
marvel
to
every
one
that
so
many
person
be
leave
alive
.
<EOS>
dejection
and
despair
of
the
dark
kind
be
succeed
by
frenzied
delight
,
and
no
bind
be
put
to
the
public
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
stranger
stop
each
other
in
the
street
,
and
converse
together
like
old
friend
.
<EOS>
the
bell
,
that
have
grow
hoarse
with
tolling
funeral
,
be
now
crack
with
joyous
peal
.
<EOS>
the
general
joy
extend
even
to
the
sick
,
and
many
,
buoy
up
by
hope
,
recover
,
when
in
the
former
season
of
despondency
they
would
inevitably
have
perish
.
<EOS>
all
fear
of
the
plague
seem
to
vanish
with
the
fly
disorder
.
<EOS>
those
who
be
scarcely
out
of
danger
join
in
the
throng
,
and
it
be
no
uncommon
sight
to
see
man
with
bandage
round
their
neck
,
or
support
by
stave
and
crutch
,
shake
hand
with
their
friend
,
and
even
embrace
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
consequence
of
this
incautious
conduct
may
be
easily
foresee
.
<EOS>
the
plague
have
receive
too
severe
a
check
to
burst
forth
anew
;
but
it
spread
further
than
it
otherwise
would
have
do
,
and
attack
many
person
,
who
but
for
their
own
imprudence
would
have
escape
.
<EOS>
amongst
other
,
a
barber
in
Saint
Martin's
-
le
-
Grand
,
who
have
flee
into
the
country
in
August
,
return
to
his
shop
in
the
middle
of
October
,
and
,
catch
the
disorder
from
one
of
his
customer
,
perish
with
the
whole
of
his
family
.
 
<EOS>
but
these
,
and
several
other
equally
fatal
instance
,
produce
no
effect
on
the
multitude
.
<EOS>
fully
persuade
that
the
virulence
of
the
disorder
be
exhaust
--
as
,
indeed
,
appear
to
be
the
case
--
they
give
free
scope
to
their
satisfaction
,
which
be
great
than
be
ever
experience
by
the
inhabitant
of
a
besiege
city
reduce
by
famine
to
the
last
strait
of
despair
,
and
suddenly
restore
to
freedom
and
plenty
.
<EOS>
the
more
pious
part
of
the
community
throng
to
the
church
,
from
which
they
have
be
so
long
absent
,
and
return
thank
for
their
unexpected
deliverance
.
<EOS>
other
,
who
have
be
terrify
into
seriousness
and
devotion
,
speedily
forget
their
former
terror
,
and
resume
their
old
habit
.
<EOS>
profaneness
and
debauchery
again
prevail
,
and
the
tavern
be
as
well
fill
as
the
church
.
<EOS>
Solomon
Eagle
continue
his
midnight
course
through
the
street
;
but
he
could
no
longer
find
an
audience
as
before
.
<EOS>
those
who
listen
to
him
only
laugh
at
his
denunciation
of
a
new
judgment
,
and
tell
him
his
preaching
and
prophesying
be
now
completely
out
of
date
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
number
of
those
who
have
quit
London
have
return
to

,
the

<EOS>
the

take
by

<EOS>
during

time
the

have
not

<EOS>
the
wisdom
of
this
plan
be
now
make
fully
apparent
.
<EOS>
the
plague
be
decline
fast
,
and
not
an
inmate
of
his
house
have
be
attack
by
it
.
<EOS>
soon
after
the
melancholy
occurrence
,
he
have
be
inform
by
Doctor
Hodges
of
Amabel
's
death
;
but
the
humane
physician
conceal
from
him
the
painful
circumstance
under
which
it
occur
.
<EOS>
It
require
all
Mr.
Bloundel
's
fortitude
to
support
him
under
the
shock
of
this
intelligence
,
and
he
do
not
communicate
the
afflict
tiding
to
his
wife
until
he
have
prepare
her
for
their
reception
.
<EOS>
but
she
bear
them
better
than
he
have
anticipate
;
and
though
she
mourn
her
daughter
deeply
and
truly
,
she
appear
completely
resign
to
the
loss
.
<EOS>
sorrow
pervade
the
whole
household
for
some
week
;
and
the
grocer
,
who
never
relax
his
system
,
shroud
his
suffering
under
the
appearance
of
additional
austerity
of
manner
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
a
great
consolation
to
him
to
see
Leonard
Holt
;
but
the
apprentice
have
disappear
;
and
even
Doctor
Hodges
could
give
no
account
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
one
night
,
in
the
middle
of
November
,
Mr.
Bloundel
signify
to
his
wife
his
intention
of
go
forth
,
early
on
the
follow
morning
,
to
satisfy
himself
that
the
plague
be
really
abating
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
after
he
have
finish
his
devotion
,
and
break
his
fast
,
he
put
his
design
into
execution
.
<EOS>
His
first
act
,
after
lock
the
door
behind
him
,
which
he
do
as
a
measure
of
precaution
,
be
to
fall
on
his
knee
and
offer
up
prayer
to
Heaven
for
his
signal
preservation
.
<EOS>
He
then
arise
,
and
,
step
into
the
middle
of
the
street
,
gaze
at
the
habitation
which
have
form
his
prison
and
refuge
for
nearly
six
month
.
<EOS>
there
it
be
,
with
its
shutter
close
and
bar
--
a
secure
asylum
,
with
all
alive
within
it
,
while
every
other
dwelling
in
the
street
be
desolate
.
 
<EOS>
the
grocer
's
sensation
be
novel
and
extraordinary
.
<EOS>
His
first
impulse
be
to
enjoy
his
newly
-
recover
freedom
,
and
to
put
himself
into
active
motion
.
<EOS>
but
he
check
the
feeling
as
sinful
,
and
proceed
along
the
street
at
a
slow
pace
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
meet
a
single
person
,
until
he
reach
Cheapside
,
where
he
find
matter
completely
change
.
<EOS>
several
shop
be
already
open
,
and
there
be
a
few
cart
and
other
vehicle
track
their
way
through
the
broad
and
yet
grass
-
grow
street
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
clear
,
frosty
morning
,
and
there
be
a
healthful
feel
in
the
bracing
atmosphere
that
produce
an
exhilarating
effect
on
the
spirit
.
<EOS>
the
grocer
pursue
his
course
through
the
middle
of
the
street
,
carefully
avoid
all
contact
with
such
person
as
he
encounter
,
though
he
cordially
return
their
greeting
,
and
wander
on
,
scarcely
know
whither
he
be
go
,
but
deeply
interested
in
all
he
beheld
.
 
<EOS>
the
aspect
of
the
city
be
indeed
most
curious
.
<EOS>
the
house
be
for
the
most
part
unoccupied
--
the
street
overgrow
with
grass
--
while
every
object
,
animate
and
inanimate
,
bear
some
mark
of
the
recent
visitation
.
<EOS>
still
,
all
look
hopeful
,
and
the
grocer
could
not
doubt
that
the
bad
be
past
.
<EOS>
the
different
demeanour
of
the
various
individual
he
meet
strike
him
.
<EOS>
now
he
pass
a
young
man
whistle
cheerily
,
who
salute
him
,
and
say
,
"
I
have
lose
my
sweetheart
by
the
plague
,
but
I
shall
soon
get
another
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
next
be
a
grave
man
,
who
mutter
,
"
I
have
lose
all
,
"
and
walk
pensively
on
.
<EOS>
then
come
other
in
different
mood
;
but
all
concur
in
think
that
the
plague
be
at
an
end
;
and
the
grocer
derive
additional
confirmation
of
the
fact
from
meet
numerous
cart
and
other
vehicle
bring
family
back
to
their
house
from
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
after
roam
about
for
several
hour
,
and
ponder
on
all
he
see
,
he
find
himself
before
the
great
western
entrance
of
Saint
Paul
's
.
<EOS>
It
chance
to
be
the
morning
on
which
the
pallet
and
bedding
be
bring
forth
,
and
he
watch
the
proceeding
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
all
have
be
remove
,
and
he
be
about
to
depart
,
when
he
perceive
a
person
seat
on
a
block
of
stone
,
not
far
from
him
,
whom
he
instantly
recognise
.
<EOS>
"
Leonard
,
"
he
cried--"Leonard
Holt
,
be
it
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
thus
address
,
and
in
these
familiar
tone
,
the
apprentice
look
up
,
and
Mr.
Bloundel
start
at
the
change
that
have
take
place
in
him
.
<EOS>
profound
grief
be
write
in
every
line
of
his
thin
and
haggard
countenance
;
his
eye
be
hollow
,
and
have
the
most
melancholy
expression
imaginable
;
and
his
flesh
be
waste
away
from
the
bone
.
<EOS>
He
look
the
very
image
of
hopeless
affliction
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
to
find
you
in
this
state
,
Leonard
,
"
say
the
grocer
,
in
a
tone
of
deep
commiseration
;
"
but
I
be
well
aware
of
the
cause
.
<EOS>
I
myself
have
suffer
severely
;
but
I
deem
it
my
duty
to
control
my
affliction
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
_
would
_
control
it
,
if
it
be
possible
,
Mr.
Bloundel
,
"
reply
Leonard
.
"
<EOS>
but
hope
be
dead
in
my
breast
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
be
happy
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
trust
otherwise
,
"
reply
the
grocer
,
kindly
.
"
<EOS>
Your
trial
have
be
very
great
,
and
so
be
those
of
the
poor
creature
we
both
of
us
deplore
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
at
peace
,
and
therefore
we
need
not
lament
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
alas
!
"
exclaim
Leonard
,
mournfully
,
"
I
be
now
only
anxious
to
rejoin
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
selfish
,
if
not
sinful
,
to
grieve
in
this
way
,
"
rejoin
Mr.
Bloundel
,
somewhat
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
bear
your
sorrow
like
a
man
.
<EOS>
come
home
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
a
father
to
you
.
<EOS>
nay
,
do
not
hesitate
.
<EOS>
I
will
have
no
refusal
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
take
Leonard
's
arm
,
and
lead
him
in
the
direction
of
wood
-
street
.
<EOS>
nothing
pass
between
them
on
the
way
,
nor
do
Leonard
evince
any
further
emotion
until
he
enter
the
door
of
the
grocer
's
dwelling
,
when
he
utter
a
deep
groan
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bloundel
be
greatly
affect
at
see
him
,
as
be
the
rest
of
the
family
,
and
abundance
of
tear
be
shed
by
all
,
except
Mr.
Bloundel
,
who
maintain
his
customary
stoical
demeanour
throughout
the
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
satisfied
that
the
pestilence
have
not
decline
sufficiently
to
warrant
him
in
open
his
house
,
the
grocer
determine
to
await
the
result
of
a
few
week
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
that
very
night
,
he
have
reason
to
think
he
have
defeat
his
plan
by
precipitancy
.
<EOS>
while
sit
after
prayer
with
his
family
,
he
be
seize
with
a
sudden
shivering
and
sickness
,
which
he
could
not
doubt
be
the
precursor
of
the
plague
.
<EOS>
He
be
greatly
alarm
,
but
do
not
lose
his
command
over
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
most
imprudent
,
"
he
say
,
"
in
thus
expose
myself
to
infection
.
<EOS>
I
have
symptom
of
the
plague
about
me
,
and
will
instantly
repair
to
one
of
the
upper
room
which
I
have
lay
aside
as
an
hospital
,
in
case
of
any
emergency
like
the
present
.
<EOS>
none
of
you
must
attend
me
.
<EOS>
Leonard
will
fetch
Doctor
Hodges
and
a
nurse
.
<EOS>
I
shall
then
do
very
well
.
<EOS>
farewell
,
dear
wife
and
child
!
<EOS>
God
bless
you
all
,
and
watch
over
you
.
<EOS>
remember
me
in
your
prayer
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
arise
and
walk
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
His
wife
and
eld
son
would
have
assist
him
,
but
he
motion
them
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
me
go
with
you
,
sir
,
"
cry
Leonard
,
who
have
arise
with
the
other
;
"
I
will
nurse
you
;
my
life
be
of
little
consequence
,
and
I
can
not
be
more
satisfactorily
employ
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
grocer
reluctantly
assent
,
and
the
apprentice
assist
him
upstairs
,
and
help
to
place
him
in
bed
.
<EOS>
no
plague
-
token
could
be
find
about
his
person
,
but
as
the
same
alarming
symptom
still
continue
,
Leonard
administer
such
remedy
as
he
think
needful
,
and
then
go
in
search
of
Doctor
Hodges
.
 
<EOS>
on
reach
watling
-
street
,
he
find
Doctor
Hodges
about
to
retire
to
rest
.
<EOS>
the
worthy
physician
be
greatly
distress
by
the
apprentice
's
account
of
his
master
's
illness
;
but
be
somewhat
reassured
when
the
symptom
be
more
minutely
describe
to
him
.
<EOS>
while
prepare
certain
medicine
,
and
arm
himself
with
his
surgical
implement
,
he
question
Leonard
as
to
the
cause
of
his
long
disappearance
.
"
<EOS>
have
see
nothing
of
you
,
"
he
say
,
"
since
the
fatal
night
when
our
poor
Amabel
's
sorrow
be
end
,
I
begin
to
feel
very
apprehensive
on
your
account
.
<EOS>
where
have
you
be
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
hear
,
"
reply
Leonard
,
"
though
the
relation
will
be
like
open
my
wound
afresh
.
<EOS>
on
recover
from
the
terrible
shock
I
have
receive
,
I
find
myself
stretch
upon
a
bed
in
a
house
whither
<EOS>
I
have
be
convey
by
Rainbird
the
watchman
,
who
have
discover
me
lie
in
a
state
of
insensibility
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
for
nearly
a
week
I
continue
delirious
,
and
should
,
probably
,
have
lose
my
sense
altogether
but
for
the
attention
of
the
watchman
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
be
able
to
move
,
I
wander
to
the
less
plague
-
pit
,
in
Finsbury
Fields
,
you
will
guess
with
what
intent
.
<EOS>
My
heart
seem
break
,
and
I
think
I
should
pour
forth
my
very
soul
in
grief
,
as
I
gaze
into
that
dreadful
gulf
,
and
think
she
be
there
inter
.
<EOS>
still
my
tear
be
a
relief
.
<EOS>
every
evening
,
for
a
month
,
I
go
to
that
sad
spot
,
and
remain
there
till
daybreak
admonish
me
to
return
to
Rainbird
's
dwelling
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
he
be
seize
by
the
distemper
;
but
though
I
nurse
him
,
voluntarily
expose
myself
to
infection
,
and
pray
to
be
carry
off
,
I
remain
untouched
.
<EOS>
Poor
Rainbird
die
;
and
have
see
his
body
throw
into
the
pit
,
I
set
off
into
Berkshire
,
and
after
three
day
'
toilsome
travel
on
foot
,
reach
Ashdown
Park
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
melancholy
pleasure
to
behold
the
abode
where
she
I
have
love
pass
her
last
few
day
of
happiness
,
and
where
I
have
be
near
her
.
<EOS>
Her
aunt
,
good
Mrs.
Buscot
,
though
overwhelm
by
affliction
at
the
sad
tiding
I
bring
her
,
receive
me
with
the
utmost
kindness
,
and
try
to
console
me
.
<EOS>
My
sorrow
,
however
,
be
too
deeply
seated
to
be
remove
.
<EOS>
wander
over
the
down
,
I
visit
Mrs.
Compton
at
Kingston
Lisle
,
from
whose
house
Amabel
be
carry

<EOS>
She

receive
me
with
kindness
,
and
strove
,
like
Mrs.
Buscot
,
to
comfort
me
,
and
,
like
her
,
ineffectually
.
<EOS>
find
my
strength
decline
,
and
persuade
that
my
day
be
draw
to
a
close
,
I
retrace
my
step
to
London

hope

find
a
final
resting

"
You

<EOS>
the
MIDNIGHT
MEETING
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
day
of
his
deliverance
be
spend
by
the
grocer
in
the
praiseworthy
manner
before
relate
,
he
lay
his
head
upon
his
pillow
with
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
such
as
he
have
not
for
month
experience
.
<EOS>
a
very
remarkable
dream
occur
to
him
that
night
,
and
its
recollection
afterwards
afford
him
the
great
consolation
.
<EOS>
while
think
of
Amabel
,
and
of
the
delight
her
presence
would
have
afford
him
,
slumber
stole
upon
him
,
and
his
dream
be
naturally
influence
by
his
previous
meditation
.
<EOS>
It
appear
to
him
that
he
be
alone
within
his
house
,
and
while
visit
one
of
the
upper
room
,
which
have
formerly
be
appropriate
to
his
lose
daughter
,
he
notice
a
small
door
in
the
wall
that
have
never
before
attract
his
attention
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
push
against
it
,
and
yield
to
the
touch
,
it
admit
him
to
an
apartment
with
which
he
seem
acquaint
,
though
he
could
not
recall
the
time
when
he
have
see
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
large
and
gloomy
,
panel
with
dark
and
lustrous
oak
,
and
fill
with
rich
but
decay
furniture
.
<EOS>
at
the
further
end
stand
a
large
antique
bed
,
hang
round
with
tarnished
brocade
curtain
.
<EOS>
the
grocer
shudder
at
the
sight
,
for
he
remember
to
have
hear
Doctor
Hodges
assert
,
that
in
such
a
bed
,
and
in
such
a
room
as
this
,
his
daughter
have
breathe
her
last
.
<EOS>
some
one
appear
to
be
within
the
bed
,
and
rush
forward
with
a
throb
heart
,
and
a
foreboding
of
what
be
to
follow
,
he
behold
the
form
of
Amabel
.
<EOS>
yes
,
there
she
be
,
with
feature
like
those
she
wear
on
earth
,
but
clothe
with
such
celestial
beauty
,
and
bear
the
impress
of
such
serene
happiness
,
that
the
grocer
feel
awe
-
strike
as
he
gaze
at
her
!
 
<EOS>
"
Approach
,
my
father
,
"
say
the
visionary
form
,
in
a
voice
so
musical
that
it
thrill
through
his
frame--"approach
,
and
let
what
you
now
hear
be
for
ever
grave
upon
your
heart
.
<EOS>
do
not
lament
me
more
,
but
rather
rejoice
that
I
be
remove
from
trouble
,
and
in
the
enjoyment
of
supreme
felicity
.
<EOS>
such
a
state
you
will
yourself
attain
.
<EOS>
You
have
run
the
good
race
,
and
will
assuredly
reap
your
reward
.
<EOS>
comfort
<EOS>
my
dear
mother
,
my
brother
,
my
little
sister
,
with
the
assurance
of
what
I
tell
you
,
and
bid
them
dry
their
tear
.
<EOS>
I
can
now
read
the
secret
of
all
heart
,
and
know
how
true
be
Leonard
Holt
's
love
for
me
,
and
how
deep
and
sincere
be
his
present
sorrow
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
permit
to
appear
to
him
as
I
now
appear
to
you
.
<EOS>
often
have
I
hear
him
invoke
me
in
accent
of
the
wildest
despair
,
and
have
float
past
him
on
the
midnight
breeze
,
but
could
neither
impart
consolation
to
him
nor
make
him
sensible
of
my
presence
,
because
his
grief
be
sinful
.
<EOS>
bid
him
be
comfort
.
<EOS>
bid
him
put
a
due
control
upon
his
feeling
.
<EOS>
bid
him
open
his
heart
anew
,
and
he
shall
yet
be
happy
,
yet
love
again
,
and
have
his
love
requite
.
<EOS>
farewell
,
dear
father
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
with
these
word
the
curtain
of
the
bed
close
.
<EOS>
the
grocer
stretch
out
his
arm
to
draw
them
aside
,
and
in
the
effort
awake
.
<EOS>
He
sleep
no
more
that
night
,
but
dwelt
with
unutterable
delight
on
the
word
he
have
hear
.
<EOS>
on
rise
,
his
first
object
be
to
seek
out
Leonard
,
and
to
relate
his
vision
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
apprentice
listen
in
speechless
wonder
,
and
remain
for
some
time
lose
in
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
"
from
any
other
person
than
yourself
,
sir
,
"
he
say
,
at
length
,
"
I
may
have
doubt
this
singular
story
,
but
come
from
you
,
I
attach
implicit
credence
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
_
<EOS>
will
_
obey
your
saint
daughter
's
injunction
;
<EOS>
I
_
will
<EOS>
_
struggle
against
the
grief
that
overwhelm
me
,
and
will
try
to
hope
that
her
word
may
be
fulfil
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
do
wisely
,
"
rejoin
Mr.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
after
breakfast
we
will
walk
together
to
the
farmhouse
you
speak
of
at
Kensal
Green
,
and
if
its
owner
should
prove
willing
to
receive
my
family
for
a
few
week
,
I
will
remove
them
thither
at
once
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
applaud
his
master
's
resolution
,
express
his
firm
conviction
that
Farmer
Wingfield
would
readily
accede
to
the
proposal
,
and
the
rest
of
the
family
have
by
this
time
assemble
,
they
sit
down
to
breakfast
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as

the
care
of
the
shop
to
Stephen
and
Blaize
,
and
accompany
by
Leonard
,
set
forth
.
<EOS>
on
the
way
to
the
west
end
of
the
town
,
the
grocer
meet
one
or
two
of
his
old
friend
,
and
they
welcome
each
other
like

<EOS>
Their
course

have
rage
with
the
great
severity

and
where
many

still
without

<EOS>
"
if
all

sigh
the
grocer
,
as
he
gaze
at
these
desolate
habitation

"
<EOS>
how
many
life
,
under
God
's
providence
,
would
have

"
 
<EOS>
"
in
my
opinion
,
sir

"
reply
Leonard
,
"
you
owe
your
preservation
as
much
to
your
piety
as
to
your
prudence

"
 
<EOS>

I
have
place

<EOS>
"
I
know
whom
you
mean

sir

"
interrupt
Leonard
,
with
some
fierceness
,
"
but
a
day
of
retribution
will
arrive
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
more
of
this
,
"
rejoin
the
grocer
,
severely
.
"
<EOS>
remember
the
solemn
injunction

.
"
 
<EOS>
at
this
moment
they
observe
a
horseman
,
richly
attire

and
follow
by
a
couple
of
attendant

ride
rapidly
towards
them

<EOS>
both
instantly
recognise
him

's
cheek
and
brow
flush
with
anger

and
Mr.
Bloundel

much
ado
to
control
his
emotion

It

advanced
towards

<EOS>
notice
the
fury
that
gleam
in
Leonard

eye
,
and
apprehend
some
violence
on
his
part
,
the
grocer
lay
his
hand
,
upon
his
arm
,
and
sternly
enjoin
him
to
calm
himself
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time

the
earl

"
<EOS>
Mr.

he
say
,
in
a
tone
of
much
emotion

and
with
a
look
that
seem
to
bespeak
contrition
.
<EOS>
"
I
hear
that
you
have
open
your
house
yesterday
,
and
be
about
to
call
upon
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
few
word
to
say
to
you
on
a
subject
painful
to
both
of
us
,
but
doubly
painful
to
me
--
your
daughter

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
decline
to
hear
them

reply
the
grocer

coldly
;
"
nor

you
ever
cross
my
threshold

my
consent

My
poor
child

now
at
peace

<EOS>
You

as

you
a
piece
of
caution

<EOS>
Your
life
be
in
danger
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
easily
guess
from
whom
,
"
reply
the
apprentice
,
scornfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
mistake
,
"
rejoin
Rochester
;
"
you
have
nothing
to
apprehend
from
me
.
<EOS>
You
have
promise
to
meet
some
one
to
-
night
,
"
he
add
,
in
so
low
a
tone
as
to
be
inaudible
to
the
grocer
.
"
<EOS>
do
not
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
lordship
's
warning
will
not
deter
me
,
"
rejoin
the
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
"
as
you
will
,
"
rejoin
Rochester
,
turn
away
.
<EOS>
and
spring
upon
his
horse
,
and
strike
his
spur
into
his
side
,
he
dash
off
,
while
Leonard
and
the
grocer
take
the
opposite
direction
.
<EOS>
in
less
than
half
an
hour
they
reach
the
little
village
of
Paddington
,
then
consist
of
a
few
house
,
but
now
one
of
the
most
populous
and
important
parish
of
the
metropolis
,
and
speedily
gain
the
open
country
.
<EOS>
even
at
this
dreary
season
the
country
have
charm
,
which
Mr.
Bloundel
,
after
his
long
confinement
,
could
fully
appreciate
.
<EOS>
His
eye
roam
over
the
wide
prospect
;
and
the
leafless
tree
,
the
bare
hedge
,
and
the
frost
-
bind
field
seem
pleasant
in
his
sight
.
 
<EOS>
He
quicken
his
pace
,
and
be
wholly
indifferent
to
the
cold
,
greatly
enjoy
the
exercise
.
<EOS>
Leonard
point
out
to
him
the
spot
where
the
fugitive
from
the
plague
have
pitch
their
tent
,
and
also
the
pest
-
house
near
Westbourne
Green
,
where
he
himself
have
be
receive
during
his
second
attack
of
the
distemper
,
and
which
be
now
altogether
abandon
.
 
<EOS>
soon
after
this
,
they
mount
the
hill
beyond
Kensal
Green
,
and
approach
the
farmhouse
.
<EOS>
Leonard
descry
Wingfield
near
one
of
the
barn
,
and
hail
him
,
he
immediately
come
forward
.
<EOS>
on
be
inform
of
Mr.
Bloundel
's
desire
,
he
at
once
assent
,
and
take
them
into
the
house
,
mention
the
matter
to
his
dame
,
who
be
quite
of
the
same
opinion
as
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
only
difference
between
us
<EOS>
,
"
he
say
to
Mr.
Bloundel
,
"
be
as
to
the
payment
you
propose
.
<EOS>
now
I
will
take
none
--
not
a
farthing
.
<EOS>
come
when
you
please
,
bring
whom
you
please
,
and
stay
as
long
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
but
do
not
offer
me
anything
if
you
would
not
offend
me
.
<EOS>
recollect
,
"
he
add
,
the
moisture
force
itself
into
his
eye
,
and
his
strong
clear
voice
become
husky
with
emotion
,
"
that
I
love
your
daughter
for
her
resemblance
to
my
poor
child
.
<EOS>
She
,
too
,
be
go
.
<EOS>
I
do
this
for
her
sake
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
shake
the
worthy
man
warmly
by
the
hand
,
but
he
make
no
further
objection
,
resolve
in
his
own
mind
to
find
some
other
mean
of
requite
his
hospitality
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
agree
that
the
grocer
should
bring
his
family
on
the
follow
day
,
and
remain
there
for
a
month
;
and
every
other
arrangement
be
make
,
and
a
hearty
meal
partaken
of
,
he
cordially
thank
his
host
,
and
return
with
Leonard
to
wood
-
street
.
 
<EOS>
in
spite
of
his
effort
to
resist
the
impression
produce
by
the
earl
's
warning
,
Leonard
could
not
banish
it
from
his
mind
;
and
though
he
do
not
for
a
moment
think
of
abandon
his
purpose
,
he
resolve
to
attend
the
meeting
armed
.
<EOS>
He
tell
Mr.
Bloundel
he
should
go
out
that
night
,
but
do
not
state
his
object
,
and
the
grocer
do
not
inquire
it
.
<EOS>
Blaize
sit
up
with
him
,
and
display
much
anxiety
to
know
whither
he
be
go
,
but
,
as
may
be
suppose
,
his
curiosity
be
not
gratify
.
<EOS>
as
the
clock
strike
eleven
,
Leonard
thrust
a
sword
into
his
girdle
,
and
arm
himself
furthermore
with
his
staff
,
proceed
towards
the
door
,
and
bade
Blaize
lock
it
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
probably
be
back
in
a
couple
of
hour
,
"
he
say
,
as
he
go
forth
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
sit
up
for
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
where
he
be
go
!
"
<EOS>
think
Blaize
,
"
from
his
gloomy
look
,
and
the
weapon
he
have
take
with
him
,
I
should
judge
he
be
about
to
murder
some
one
--
perhaps
the
Earl
of
Rochester
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
prevent
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
though
perhaps
rather
more
influence
by
curiosity
than
any
well
feeling
,
the
porter
wait
a
few
second
to
allow
the
apprentice
to
get
out
of
sight
,
and
then
lock
the
door
outside
,
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
,
and
follow
him
.
<EOS>
the
night
be
profoundly
dark
,
but
he
have
notice
the
direction
take
by
Leonard
,
and
run
noiselessly
along
the
street
,
soon
perceive
him
a
little
in
advance
.
<EOS>
regulate
his
pace
by
that
of
the
apprentice
,
and
keep
about
fifty
yard
behind
him
,
he
track
his
course
along
several
street
,
until
he
see
him
pass
through
the
second
postern
in
the
city
wall
,
near
Moorgate
.
 
<EOS>
here
he
debate
with
himself
whether
to
proceed
further
or
turn
back
;
but
at
length
,
curiosity
get
the
good
of
his
fear
,
and
he
go
on
.
<EOS>
a
few
step
bring
him
into
the
open
field
,
and
fancy
he
see
Leonard
at
a
little
distance
before
him
,
he
hurry
on
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
but
he
soon
find
he
have
be
deceive
by
the
stump
of
a
tree
,
and
begin
to
fear
he
must
have
take
the
wrong
course
.
<EOS>
He
look
around
in
vain
for
some
object
to
guide
him
.
<EOS>
the
darkness
be
so
profound
that
he
could
see
nothing
,
and
he
set
off
again
at
random
,
and
not
without
much
self
-
reproach
and
misgiving
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
he
reach
a
hedge
,
and
continue
to
skirt
it
,
until
he
perceive
through
the
bush
the
light
of
a
lantern
in
the
adjoining
field
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
call
out
,
but
at
the
cry
the
light
disappear
.
<EOS>
this
do
not
prevent
him
from
make
towards
the
spot
where
he
have
see
it
;
but
he
have
not
proceed
far
when
he
be
forcibly
seize
by
some
unseen
person
,
throw
on
the
ground
,
and
a
draw
sword
--
for
he
feel
the
point
--
place
at
his
throat
.
 
<EOS>
"
utter
a
cry
,
and
it
be
your
last
,
"
cry
a
stern
voice
.
<EOS>
"
where
be
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
who
--
who

"
demand
Blaize
,
half
dead
with
terror
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
whom
you

to
meet

reply
the
unknown
.
 
<EOS>
"
I

Blaize

<EOS>
"
Liar

exclaim
the
other
;

if
you

not
instantly

me
to
him

I
will

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will

you
wherever
you

if
you

up

Blaize
,
with
difficulty
repress
a
cry
.
 
<EOS>
"
by
the
daughter
of
Nox
and
Acheron
!
"
exclaim
a
voice
which
sound
like
music
in
the
porter
's
ear
,
"
I
think
you
be
mistaken
in
your
man

<EOS>
It
do
not

<EOS>
"
It

Major
Pillichody

the
porter

<EOS>
"
It

<EOS>
"
Blaize

"
exclaim
Pillichody
,
unmask
a
dark
lantern
,
and
reveal
the
terror
-
stricken
countenance
of
the
porter
;
"
so
it
be
.
<EOS>
in
the
devil
's
name
,
what
be
you

here
?

"
 
<EOS>
"
the
devil

who
put
it
into
my
head
to
come

reply
Blaize
;
"
but
I
follow
Leonard
Holt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
which
way
do
he
take
?
<EOS>
"
ask
the
person
who
have
assail
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
exactly
say
,
"
reply
Blaize
,
"
but
he
seem
to
go
straight
into
the
field
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
no
doubt
go
to
the
plague
-
pit
,
"
reply
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
now
at
liberty
,
"
he
add
to
Blaize
,
"
and
I
counsel
you
to
make
the
good
of
your
way
home
.
<EOS>
say
nothing
to
your
master
of
what
have
occur
.
<EOS>
the
city
wall
lie
in
that
direction
.
"
 
<EOS>
overjoy
to
be
release
,
Blaize
run
off
as
fast
as
his
leg
could
carry
him
,
and
never
stop
till
he
reach
Moorgate
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
Leonard
have
reach
the
place
of
meeting
.
<EOS>
as
he
stand
by
the
rail
surround
the
plague
-
pit
,
he
think
of
Mr.
Bloundel
's
singular
dream
,
and
almost
hope
to
be
similarly
favour
,
fling
himself
on
his
knee
,
and
besought
Amabel
,
if
it
be
possible
,
to
appear
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
his
entreaty
produce
no
result
.
<EOS>
the
chill
blast
whistle
past
him
,
and
,
mindful
of
what
have
be
tell
him
,
he
be
fain
to
interpret
this
into
an
answer
to
his
request
.
<EOS>
the
night
be
bitterly
cold
,
and
Leonard
,
whose
limb
be
almost
stiffen
by
long
kneeling
,
walk
round
and
round
the
enclosure
at
a
quick
pace
to
put
his
blood
into
circulation
.
<EOS>
as
the
hour
of
midnight
be
toll
forth
by
the
neighbouring
church
,
he
hear
footstep
,
and
could
just
detect
a
figure
advance
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
you
there
?
"
be
ask
in
the
voice
of
Thirlby
.
<EOS>
Leonard
reply
in
the
affirmative
,
and
the
other
instantly
join
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
you
mention
our
meeting
to
any
one
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
because
I
be
warn
by
the
Earl
of
Rochester
not
to
attend
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
strange
!
"
exclaim
Thirlby
,
musingly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
however
,
do
not
let
us
waste
time
.
<EOS>
I
be
about
to
leave
London
,
perhaps
this
country
--
for
ever
.
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
depart
without
an
interview
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
be
aware
of
my
strong
attachment
to
my
poor
lost
child
.
<EOS>
My
daughter
Isabella
now
supply
her
place
in
my
heart
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
only
be
I
love
on
earth
,
for
my
son
have
alienate
himself
from
my
affection
.
<EOS>
all
I
desire
be
to
see
her
happy
.
<EOS>
this
,
I
find
,
can
only
be
accomplish
in
one
way
.
"
 
<EOS>
here
he
pause
for
a
moment
,
but
as
Leonard
make
no
remark
,
he
proceed
.
<EOS>
"
why
should
I
hesitate
to
declare
it
,
"
he
say
,
"
since
it
be
for
that
object
I
bring
you
hither
?
<EOS>
She
love
you
--
devotedly
love
you
--
and
if
her
wish
be
oppose
,
I
should
tremble
for
the
consequence
.
<EOS>
now
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
situate
as
you
be
,
you
never
can
we
would
her
.
<EOS>
I
will
,
however
,
point
out
a
means
by
which
you
can
raise
yourself
to
distinction
in
a
short
time
,
and
so
entitle
yourself
to
claim
her
hand
.
<EOS>
I
will
supply
you
with
money
--
more
than
you
can
require
--
will
place
you
at
court
--
near
the
king
's
person
--
and
if
you
act
under
my
direction
,
your
rise
be
certain
.
<EOS>
I
have
extort
a
promise
to
this
effect
from
my
own
son
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
my
object
,
and
that
if
he
do
not
make
your
fortune
,
I
could
ruin
him
by
reveal
myself
.
<EOS>
I
may
,
perhaps
,
pay
the
penalty
of
my
crime
on
the
scaffold
;
but
I
may
also
escape
.
<EOS>
in
the
latter
case
,
my
reappearance
would
be
fatal
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
consent
to
cooperate
with
me
,
to
watch
over
your
fortune
,
and
,
as
soon
as
you
have
attain
sufficient
eminence
,
to
bestow
his
sister
upon
you
.
<EOS>
now
do
you
understand

<EOS>
"
I
do

Leonard

Yon

sin
so
deeply

"
 
<EOS>
at
this
juncture

the
baker

who
have
disappear
for
a
few
second
from
the
window

again
present
himself
at

and

with
some
difficulty

force
a
feather
bed
through
it

which

instantly
place
by

in
such
a
position
beneath

as
to
break
the

<EOS>
tie
a
couple

and
fasten
one
end
round
his
wife

waist
,
the
baker
lower
her
and
the
child
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
They
alight
in
safety
;
but
just
as

be
about
to
follow
their
example
,
the
floor
of
the
room

and
though
he
succeed
in
spring
through
the
window

he
miss
the
feather

and
break
his
leg
in
the

<EOS>
He
be
pick
up

Chowles

Judith

and
place
upon
the

in
a
state
of
insensibility
,
and
be
soon
afterwards
convey
with
his
family
to
the
house
of
a
neighbour

<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
fire
have
spread
to
the
house
on
either
side
of
the
unfortunate
man
's
habitation
,
and
both
of
them
be
build
entirely
of
wood
,
they
be
almost
instantly
in

<EOS>
the
alarm
too
have
become
general
;
the
inhabitant
of
the
adjoining
house
be
fill
with
indescribable
terror
,
and
the
narrow
street
be
speedily
crowd
with
person
of
both
sex

who
have
rush
from
their
bed
to
ascertain
the
extent

the
danger

<EOS>
all
be
terror
and
confusion

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
to
add
to
the
general
distress

a
report

that
a
house
in
fish

street
-
hill
be
on
fire
,
and
it
be
soon
find
to
be
true
,
as
an
immense
volume
of
flame
burst
forth
in
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
while
the
rest
of
the
spectator
,
distract
by
this
calamity
,
and
hardly
know
what
to

,
hurry
in

Chowles

Judith
eye
each

and
the
former
whisper
to
his
companion
,
"
this
be
another
piece
of
Hubert

handiwork
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
two
wretch
now
think
it
time
to
bestir
themselves
.
<EOS>
so
much
confusion
prevail
,
that
they
be
wholly
unobserved
,
and
under
the
plea
of
rendering
assistance
,
they
enter
house
and
carry
off
whatever
excite
their
cupidity
,
or
be
sufficiently
portable
.
<EOS>
no
wealthy
house
have
be
attack
as
yet
,
and
therefore
their
spoil
be
but
trifle
.
<EOS>
the
poor
baker
seem
to
be
the
bearer
of
ill
-
luck
,
for
he
have
not
be
many
minute
in
his
new
asylum
before
it
likewise
catch
fire
.
<EOS>
another
house
,
too
,
in
fish

street
-
hill
,
and
low
down
than
the
first
,
be
observe
to
be
burn
,
and
as
this
be
out
of
the
current
of
the
wind
,
and
consequently
could
not
have
be
occasion
by
the
shower
of
spark
that
mark
its
course
,
a
cry
be
instantly
raise
that
incendiary
be
abroad
,
and
several
suspicious

looking
person
be
seize
in
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
meantime
no
effort
have
be
make
to
stop
the
progress
of
the
original
conflagration
in
Pudding
-
lane
,
which
continue
to
rage
with
the
great
fury
,
spread
from
house
to
house
with
astonishing
rapidity
.
<EOS>
all
the
building
in
this
neighbourhood
be
old
,
and
of
wood
,
which
be
as
dry
as
tinder
,
a
spark
alight
upon
them
would
have
suffice
to
set
them
on
fire
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
conceive
,
therefore
,
what
must
have
be
the
effect
of
a
vast
volume
of
flame
,
fan
by
a
powerful
wind
.
<EOS>
house

house
catch
,
as
if
construct
of
touchwood

and
the
fire
roar
and
rage
to
such
a
degree
,
that
those
who
stand
by
be
too
much
terrified
to
render
any
effectual
assistance
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
sole
thought
that
now
seem
to
influence
all
<EOS>
be
the
preservation
of
a
portion
of
their
property
.
<EOS>
no

the
safety
of

<EOS>
the

instantly
fill
with
good

furniture
of
all
kind
,
throw
out
of
the
window
or
push
out
of

;
but
such
be
the
fierceness
of
the
fire
,
and
the
extraordinary
rapidity
with
which
it
advance
,
that
the
very
article
attempt
to
be

seize
by
it
,
and
thus
form
a
means
of
convey
it
to
the
opposite
house

<EOS>
in
this
way
a
number
of
person
be
inclose
for
a
short
time
between
two
fire
,
and
seem
in
imminent
danger
of
be
burn
to
death
.
<EOS>
the
perilous
nature
of
their
situation
be
,
moreover
,
increase
by
a
sudden
and
violent
gust
of
wind
,
which

blow
the
flame
right
across

seem
to
envelop
all

<EOS>
the
shriek
that
burst
from
the
poor

thus
involve
be
most
appalling
.
<EOS>
fortunately

they
sustain
no
great

for

next
moment
the

sweep
back
the

they

their

<EOS>
Chowles
and
Judith
be
among
the
sufferer

in
the
alarm

moment
lose
all
the

<EOS>
soon
after
this
the
whole

<EOS>
all

their

<EOS>
hundred
of

naked

of

towards
Thames

street
in

of
a
place
of

<EOS>
the
scene
be
wholly
without

<EOS>
many

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
all

a

but
it

<EOS>
up

a

<EOS>
as

I

<EOS>
the
Lord

to
you

Ye

while
the

wild
laughter

exclamation
of
frenzy
mirth
be
hear
amid
the

the
piteous

<EOS>
It
be
indeed
dreadful
to
see
the
old
and
bed
-
ride
force
into
the
street
to
seek
a
home
where
they
could
;
nor

dreadful
to

a

and

while
the
drunken

,
and
rejoice
beside

as

of
the
rage

<EOS>
to
proceed
for
a
moment
to
Wood

.
<EOS>
when
Philip
Grant
quit
Leonard
in
the
manner
before
relate
,
the
latter
follow
him
to
the
door
,
and
see
him
disappear
in
the
gloom
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
attempt
pursuit
,
because
he
could
not
persuade
himself
that
any
danger
be
really
to
be
apprehend
.
<EOS>
He
think
it
,
however
,
advisable
to
consult
with
Mr.
Bloundel
on
the
subject
,
and
accordingly
proceed
to
his
room
and
rouse
him
.
 
<EOS>
after
hear
what
have
occur
,
the
grocer
look
very
grave
,
and
say
,
"
I
be
not
dispose
to
treat
this
matter
so
lightly
as
you
do
,
Leonard
.
<EOS>
I
fear
this
unhappy
man
have
some
desperate
design
in
view
.
<EOS>
what
it
be
<EOS>
I
cannot
--
dare
not
--
<EOS>
conjecture
.
<EOS>
but
I
confess
I
be
full
of
apprehension
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
retire
to
rest
to
-
night
,
but
shall
hold
myself
in
readiness
to
act
in
whatever
way
may
be
necessary
,
You
have
better
go
forth
,
and
if
anything
occur
,
give
notice
to
the
proper
authority
.
<EOS>
We
have
not
now
such
a
lord
mayor
as
we
have
during
the
season
of
the
plague
.
<EOS>
the
firm
and
courageous
Sir
John
Lawrence
be
but
ill
succeed
by
the
weak
and
vacillate
Sir
Thomas
Bludworth
.
<EOS>
still
,
the
latter
may
be
equal
to
this
emergency
,
and
if
anything
happen
,
you
must
apply
to
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
follow
your
advice
implicitly
,
"
rejoin
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
I
think
there
be
nothing
to
apprehend

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
well
to
err
on
the
safe
side
,
"
observe
the
grocer
;
"
you
can
not
then
reproach
yourself
with
want
of
caution

"
 
<EOS>
shortly
after
this
,
Leonard
sally
forth
,
and
have
determine
what
course
to
pursue
in
the
first
instance
,
proceed
to
Saint
Paul
's
.
<EOS>
He
find
every
door
in
the
sacred
structure
fast
close
.
<EOS>
not
satisfied
with
this
,
he
knock
at
the
great
northern
entrance
till
the
summon
be
answer
by
a
verger
,
and
state
his
object
,
demand
to
be
admit
,
and
to
search
the
cathedral
,
as
well
as
Saint
Faith
's
.
<EOS>
the
verger
offer
no
objection
,
and
have
examine
the
old
building
throughout
,
without
discover
any
trace
of
the
person
he
be
in
quest
of
,
Leonard
quit
it
.
 
<EOS>
More
than
ever
convince
that
he
be
right
in
his
supposition
,
and
that
no
danger
be
to
be
apprehend
,
he
be
about
to
return
home
,
when
the
idea
occur
to
him
that
he
may
perhaps
find
Grant
at
the
plague
-
pit
in
Finsbury
Fields
,
and
he
accordingly
shape
his
course
thither
.
<EOS>
a
long
period
have
elapse
since
he
have
last
visit
the
melancholy
spot
,
and
it
be
not
without
much
painful
emotion
that
he
draw
near
the
vast
mound
cover
the
victim
of
the
pestilence
.
<EOS>
but
Grant
be
not
there
,
and
though
he
pace
round
and
round
the
dreary
inclosure
for
some
time
,
no
one
come
.
<EOS>
He
then
proceed
to
the
less
plague
-
pit
,
and
kneel
beside
the
grave
of
Amabel
,
bedew
it
with
his
tear
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
arise
,
with
the
intention
of
return
to
Wood
Street
,
he
observe
an
extraordinary
light
in
the
sky
a
little
to
the
left
,
evidently
produce
by
the
reflection
of
a
great
fire
in
that
direction

<EOS>
on
behold
this
light
,
he
say
to
himself
,
"
Mr.
Bloundel
be
right
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
danger
with
which
the
city

<EOS>
It
be
now
too
late

it

"
<EOS>
determine
,
however
,
to
ascertain
the
extent
of
the
calamity
without
an
instant
's
loss
of
time
,
he
set
off
at
a
swift
pace
,
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
reach
Fish
Street
Hill
,
and
stand
beside
the
conflagration
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
nearly
three
o'clock
,
and
a
vast
chasm
of
blacken
ruin
proclaim
the
devastation
that
have
be

<EOS>
just
as
he
arrive
,

of
Saint

with
a
tremendous
crash

and
for
a
few
minute

fire
be

<EOS>
It
then
arise
with
great
fury
than
ever

burst
out
on
both
side
of
the
sacred

<EOS>
the

low
part

the
cellar

vault

be
fill
with
wine

spirit

<EOS>
these
instantly
blaze
up
,
and
burn
with
such
intensity
that
the
adjoining
habitation

presently
in
flame

"

half

some
another,--and

to
go
to
the
river

I
have
the

do
not
you

such
a
fire

I

sure
I

willingly
lay
down

It

add

if

<EOS>
the
heat
of

flame
have
now

the

Finding

<EOS>
one
circumstance
,
note
by
Pepys

and
which
also
strike
Leonard
,
be
the
singular
attachment
display
by
the
pigeon
,
keep
by
the
owner
of
several
house
on

to
the
spot
they

they

<EOS>
Leonard
remain
on
the
river
nearly
two
hour
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
,
in
fact
,
tear
himself
away
from
the
spectacle
,
which
possess
a
strange
fascination
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
He
begin
to
think
that
all
the
effort
of
man
be
unavaile
to
arrest
the
progress
of
destruction
,
and
he
be
for
awhile
content
to
regard
it
as
a
mere
spectacle
.
<EOS>
and
never
have
he
beheld
a
more
impressive
--
a
more
terrible
sight
.
<EOS>
there
lie
the
vast
and
populous
city
before
him
,
which
he
have
once
before
know
to
be
invade
by
an
invisible
but
extirminate
foe
,
now
attack
by
a
furious
and
far
-
see
enemy
.
<EOS>
the
fire
seem
to
form
a
vast
arch
--
many
-
coloured
as
a
rainbow,--reflected
in
the
sky
,
and
re
-
reflect
in
all
its
horrible
splendour
in
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
the
aspect
of
the
city
less
striking
.
<EOS>
the
innumerable
tower
and
spire
of
the
church
rise
tall
and
dark
through
the
wavering
sheet
of
flame
,
and
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
one
of
them
would
topple
down
or
disappear
,
as
if
swallow
up
by
the
devour
element
.
<EOS>
for
a
short
space
,
the
fire
seem
to
observe
a
regular
progressive
movement
,
but
when
it
fall
upon
well
material
,
it
rear
its
blaze
crest
aloft
,
change
its
hue
,
and
burn
with
redouble
intensity
.
<EOS>
Leonard
watch
it
thread
narrow
alley
,
and
fire
every
less
habitation
in
its
course
,
kindle
some
great
hall
or
other
structure
,
whose
remoteness
seem
to
secure
it
from
immediate
danger
.
<EOS>
at
this
distance
,
the
roaring
of
the
flame
resemble
that
of
a
thousand
furnace
.
<EOS>
ever
and
anon
,
it
be
break
by
a
sound
like
thunder
,
occasion
by
the
fall
of
some
mighty
edifice
.
<EOS>
then
there
would
come
a
quick
succession
of
report
like
the
discharge
of
artillery
,
follow
by
a
shower
of
fiery
flake
and
spark
blow
aloft
,
like
the
explosion
of
some
stupendous
firework
.
<EOS>
mix
with
the
roaring
of
the
flame
,
the
thunder
of
fall
roof
,
the
cracking
of
timber
,
be
a
wild
hubbub
of
human
voice
,
that
sound
afar
off
like
a
dismal
wail
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
its
terror
,
the
appearance
of
the
fire
be
at
that
time
beautiful
beyond
description
.
<EOS>
Its
varying
colour
--
its
fanciful
form
--
now
shoot
out
in
a
hundred
different
direction
,
like
lightning
-
flashes,--now
draw
itself
up
,
as
it
be
,
and
soar
aloft,--now
split
into
a
million
tongue
of
flame,--these
aspect
so
rivet
the
attention
of
Leonard
,
that
he
almost
forget
in
the
sight
the
dreadful
devastation
go
forward
.
<EOS>
His
eye
ache
with
gaze
at
the
fiery
spectacle
,
and
he
be
glad
to
rest
them
on
the
black
masse
of
building
that
stand
in
stern
relief
against
it
,
and
which
there
could
be
little
doubt
would
soon
become
its
prey
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
now
broad
daylight
,
except
for
the
mighty
cloud
of
smoke
,
which
o'er
-
canopy
the
city
,
create
an
artificial
gloom
.
<EOS>
Leonard
's
troubled
gaze
wander
from
the
scene
of
destruction
to
Saint
paul'
--
an
edifice
,
<EOS>
which
;
from
the
many
event
connect
with
his
fortune
that
have
occur
there
,
have
always
a
singular
interest
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
call
to
mind
the
denunciation
pour
forth
by
Solomon
Eagle
against
this
fane
,
he
could
not
help
fear
they
would
now
be
fulfil
.
<EOS>
what
add
to
his
misgiving
be
,
that
it
be
now
almost
entirely
surround
by
pole
and
scaffolding
.
<EOS>
ever
since
the
cessation
of
the
plague
,
the
repair
,
suspend
during
that
awful
season
,
have
be
recommence
under
the
superintendence
of
Doctor
Christopher
Wren
,
and
be
now
proceed
with
renew
activity
.
<EOS>
the
whole
of
the
building
be
under
repair
,
and
a
vast
number
of
mason
be
employ
upon
it
,
and
it
be
their
scaffolding
that
impress
Leonard
with
a
dread
of
what
afterwards
actually
occur
.
<EOS>
accustomed
to
connect
the
figure
of
Solomon
Eagle
with
the
sacred
structure
,
he
could
not
help
fancy
that
he
discover
a
speck
resemble
a
human
figure
on
the
central
tower
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
the
enthusiast
,
what
must
his
feeling
be
at
find
his
prediction
so
fatally
fulfil
?
<EOS>
little
do
Leonard
think
how
the
prophecy
have
be
accomplish
!
 
<EOS>
but
his
attention
be
speedily
call
to
the
progress
of
the
conflagration
.
<EOS>
from
the
increased
tumult
in
the
city
,
it
be
evident
<EOS>
the
inhabitant
be
now
thoroughly
rouse
,
and
actively
bestir
themselves
to
save
their
property
.
<EOS>
this
be
apparent
,
even
on
the
river
,
from
the
multitude
of
boat
deeply
laden
with
good
of
all
kind
,
which
be
now
see
shape
their
course
towards
Westminster

<EOS>
the
fire

ere
<EOS>

Mr.

he
have
no

the
direful
calamity

and
when
inform

lift
up
his

despairingly
,
exclaim
,
in
accent
of
the
deep
affliction--"another

have
fall
upon
this
sinful
city,--another
judgment
yet
more
terrible
than
the
first

Your

shut
yourself
up

<EOS>
but
I
fear
you
will
not
be
able
to
ward
off
the
assault
of
the
present
enemy
,
and
recommend
you
to
remove
your

some
place

holy
zeal

to
the
roof
of

with

<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
opposite
to
the
stillness

quiet
of
a
Sabbath
morn
;
and
as
the
grocer

to
the
noise

tumult
prevail
around
him
,
he
could

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
there

severely
;

I

grieve

Mrs.

You

a
side

open
the
Bible

sit
down
calmly
to

though
no

I

what
harm

there
be
in

on
a
Sunday

I
should
like
to
know

<EOS>
I

I

I
will
not

this

It

His

It

<EOS>
He
have
scarcely

when
the
cry
of
"

rush
forward
in
an
agony
of
apprehension

he
behold
Mr.

<EOS>
a

guard
over
a
vast
heap
of
good

furniture
that
have
be
remove
from

.
 
<EOS>
so
much
beloved
be
Mr.
Bloundel
,
and
in
such
high
estimation
be
his
character
hold
,
that
all
his
neighbour
,
on
learn
that
his
house
be
on
fire
,
fly
to
his
assistance
,
and
bestir
themselves
so
actively
,
that
in
an
extraordinary
short
space
of
time
they
have
empty
the
house
of
every
article
of
value
,
and
place
it
out
of
danger
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
in
vain
the
grocer
urge
them
to
desist
:
his
entreaty
be
disregard
by
his
zealous
friend
;
and
when
he
tell
them
they
be
profane
the
Sabbath
,
they
reply
that
the
responsibility
of
their
conduct
would
rest
entirely
on
themselves
,
and
they
hope
they
may
never
have
anything
bad
to
answer
for
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
his
disapproval
of
what
be
do
,
the
grocer
could
not
but
be
sensibly
touch
by
their
devotion
,
and
as
to
his
wife
,
she
say
,
with
tear
in
her
eye
,
that

it

with
as
calm

unmove
an
expression

as

and
presently
ascertained
from
him
in
what
manner

<EOS>
It

that
while

that
purpose

supper
by
a
strong
smell
of
smoke

which
seem
to
arise
from
the
low
part
of
the
house

and
that
as
soon
as
their
devotion
be

for
Mr.
Bloundel
would
not
allow
them
to
stir
before
,
Stephen

proceed
to

the
cause
,
and

find
a
dense
smoke
issue
from
the
adjoin
cellar
,
the
door
of
which

ajar

<EOS>
hear
a
noise
in
the
yard
,
they
dart
up
the
back
step
,
communicate
with
the
cellar
,
and
discover
a
man
try
to
make
his
escape
over

by
a

<EOS>
Stephen
instantly
seize
him
,
and
the
man
,
draw
a
sword
,
try
to

himself
from

<EOS>
in

up

too
well

<EOS>
acquaint

the
premise

and
with
the
habit
of
the

and

himself
till
the

,
steal
into
the
cellar
,
and
place
a
fire

ball
amid
a
heap
of
fagot
and
coal
,
and
near
several
large
cask
of
oil
,
and
other
inflammable
matter
,
strike
a
light
,
and
set
fire
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
ever
reproach
myself
that
I

away
when
this
calamity
occur
,
"
observe
Leonard
,
as
the
grocer
bring
his
relation
to
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
will
do
so
without
reason
,
"
reply
Mr.
Bloundel
,
"
for
you
could
have
render
no

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
You
have
anticipate
my

reply
the

;
"
but
we

now
obtain
some
vehicle

transport
these
good

.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
that
my

reply
Leonard
.
<EOS>
and
in
a
short
space
of
time
he
have
procure
half
a

large

so
great
be
the
crowd
and
confusion
in
Cheapside
,
that
nearly
two
hour
elapse
before
they
reach
Newgate
;
and
,
indeed
,
if
it
have
not
be
for
the
interference
of
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
they

They

one
circumstance
strike
the
whole
party
as
remarkable
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
tremendous
glare
of
the
conflagration
,
that
even
at
this
distance
the
fire
seem
close
beside
them
,
and
if
they
have
not

the
contrary
,
they
would
have
think
it

indeed

night,--to
obtain
some
refreshment
,
and

the
intolerable
thirst
by
which
they
be

the

<EOS>
the
whole

on

and
a
distant
roar

like
the
rush

<EOS>
Westminster

the
trio
set
out
on

,
and
glean
fresh
particular
of
the
fearful
progress
of
the

,
as
they
advance
,
pass
along
Oxford

through
the
portal
of

<EOS>
here
they
learn
that
the
whole

that

They

this
intelligence
determine
them
not
to
attempt
to
proceed
further
into
the
city
,
which
they
see
be
wholly
impracticable
;
and
they
accordingly
turn
down
Ivy

lane
,
and
approach
the
cathedral
with
the
intention
,
if
possible
,
of
ascend
the
central
tower

<EOS>
They
find
a
swarm

and
proceed
towards
the
door
of
the
spiral
staircase

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
on
reach
the
summit
of
the
tower

which
they
find
occupy
by
some
dozen

twenty

a
spectacle
that
far
exceed
the
utmost
stretch
of
their
imagination
burst
upon
them
.
<EOS>
through
cloud
of
tawny
smoke
scarcely
distinguishable
from
flame
,
so
thickly
be
they
charge
with
spark
and
fire
-
flake
,
they
beheld
a
line
of
fire
spread
along
Cheapside
and
Cornhill
,
as
far
as
the
Royal
Exchange
,
which
be
now
in
flame

and
branching
upward
in
another
line
through
Lawrence

<EOS>
nearer
to
them

on
the
north

the
fire

by
the
wretched
Pillichody

perhaps
,
anticipate
the
work
of
destruction
by
a
few

proceed
to
Goldsmiths

and
be
rapidly
advance
down
Saint

to
Aldersgate

<EOS>
but
it
be
on
the
right
,
and
to
the
south
-
east
,
that
the
conflagration
assume
its
most
terrific
aspect
.
<EOS>
there
,
from
Bow
Church
to
the
river

side
,
beyond
the

as
far
as

space
of
more
than
two
mile
in
length
and
one
in
depth

every
habitation

on
fire

<EOS>
the
appearance
of
this
bed
of
flame
be
like
an
ocean
of
fire
agitate
by
a
tempest
,
in
which
a
number
of
bark

some
of
them

<EOS>
the
stunning
and
unearthly
roar
of
the

aid
this
appearance
,
which
be
further
heighten
by
the
enormous
billow
of
flame
that
ever
and
anon
roll
tumultuously
onward
as
they
be
catch
by
some
gust
of
wind
of
more
than
usual
violence

<EOS>
the
spire
of
the
church
look
like
the
spar
of
 
"
tall
admiral

that

founder
,
while
the
blacken
ruin
of
the
hall
and
large
building
well
represent
the
rib
and
beam
of
mighty
hulk

<EOS>
leave
Leonard
and
his
companion
to
the
contemplation
of
this
tremendous
spectacle
,
we
shall
proceed
to
take
a
nearer
view
of
its
ravage
.
<EOS>
every

to
preserve
the

all
the

drive
the
defender
back
as
before

seize
upon
their
barricade

and
use
them
,
like
a
skilful
besieger

<EOS>
Solomon

witness
this
scene
of
destruction

and
utter
a
laugh
of
exultation
as

upon
their
prey

<EOS>
"
I

It

<EOS>
and
so

"
 
<EOS>
hear
this
wild
speech
,
and
behold
the
extraordinary
figure
of
the
enthusiast
,
<EOS>
whose
scorched
lock
and
smoke
-
begrime
limb
give
him
almost
the
appearance
of
an
infernal
spirit
,
the
king
inquire
,
with
some
trepidation
,
from
his
attendant
,
who
or
what
he
be
,
and
be
inform
,
order
them
to
seize
him
.
<EOS>
but
the
enthusiast
set
their
attempt
at
naught
.
<EOS>
spring
with
wonderful
agility
from
fragment
to
fragment
of
the
ruin
,
and
continue
his
vociferation
,
he
at
last
plunge
through
the
flame
into
the
Exchange
itself
,
render
further
pursuit
,
of
course
,
impossible
,
unless
those
who
desire
to
capture
him
,
be
determine
to
share
his
fate
,
which
now
seem
inevitable
.
<EOS>
to
the
astonishment
of
all
,
however
,
he
appear
a
few
minute
afterwards
on
the
roof
of
the
blaze
pile
,
and
continue
his
denunciation
till
drive
away
by
the
flame
.
<EOS>
He
seem
,
indeed
,
to
bear
a
charm
life
,
for
it
be
rumour
--
though
the
report
be
scarcely
credit
--
that
he
have
escape
from
the
burn
building
,
and
make
good
his
retreat
to
Saint
Paul
's
.
<EOS>
soon
after
this
,
the
Exchange
be
one
mass
of
flame
.
<EOS>
have
gain
an
entrance
to
the
gallery
,
the
fire
run
round
them
with
inconceivable
swiftness
,
as
be
the
case
in
the
conflagration
of
this
later
structure
,
and
fill
every
chamber
,
gush
out
of
the
window
,
and
pour
down
upon
the
court
and
walk
below

<EOS>
fearful
and
prodigious
be
the
ruin

<EOS>
the
stone
wall

Sir
Thomas

<EOS>
deplore
the
fate
of
the
Royal
Exchange
,
the
king
and
his
attendant
proceed
to
Guildhall
.
<EOS>
but
here
they
be
too
late
,
nor
could
they
even
rescue
a
tithe
of
the
plate
and
valuable
lodge
within
it
for
security
.
<EOS>
the
effect
of
the
fire
as
display
in
this
structure
,
be
singularly
grand
and
surprising
.
<EOS>
the
great
part
of
the
ancient
fabric

compose
of
oak
of
the
hard
kind
,
it
emit
little
flame

but
become
after
a
time
red
hot

and
remain
in
this
glowing
state
till
night

when

,
"
a
mighty
palace
of

or
a

"
 
<EOS>
the
great
fury
of
the
conflagration
be

at
the
Poultry
,
where
five
distinct
fire

and
unite
their
force
--
one
which

Cornhill
from

Leonard
take
it
from
him
,
and
the
wretched
man
fall
backwards
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
a
loud
crack
be
hear
in
the
wall
behind
.
<EOS>
several
ponderous
stone
drop
from
their
place
,
admit
a
volume
of
flame
that
fill
the
whole
cell
,
and
disclose
another
body
on
the
floor
,
near
which
lie
that
of
Grant

<EOS>
horrify
by
the
spectacle
,
Leonard
stagger
off
,
and
,
catch
Wingfield
's
arm
,
seek
to
retrace
his
step
.
<EOS>
this
be
no
easy
matter
,
the
smoke
be
so
dense
,
that
they
could
not
see
a
foot
before
them
,
and
be
oblige
to
feel
their
way
along
the
wall
.
<EOS>
on
arrive
at
the
cross
passage
,
Wingfield
would
fain
have
turn
off
to
the
right
,
but
Leonard
draw
him
forcibly
in
the
opposite
direction
;
and
most
fortunate
be
it
that
he
do
so
,
or
the
worthy
farmer
would
inevitably
have
perish
.
<EOS>
at
last
they
reach
the
lodge
,
and
sink
down
on
a
bench
from
exhaustion
.
 
<EOS>
"
so
,
my
master
,
"
observe
the
turnkey
,
with
a
grim
smile
,
"
you
be
not
able

<EOS>
but
receive
no

he

,
"
<EOS>
well

and
what

"

return
Leonard

up
and
quit
the

<EOS>
follow
by
Wingfield

Conduit

<EOS>
where

a

it
with
water

and
plunge
his
head
into
it

<EOS>
refresh
by
the
immersion
,
he
now
glance
at
the
document
commit
to
him
by
Grant
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
piece
of
parchment
,
and
show
by
its
shrivelled
and
scorched
appearance
the
agony
which
its
late
possessor
must
have
endure
,
Leonard
do
not
open
it
,
but
thrust
it
with
a
shudder
into
his
doublet
.
 
<EOS>
meditate
on
the
strange
and
terrible
event
that
have
just
occur
,
Leonard

thought
involuntarily
wander
to
the
Lady
Isabella
,
whose
image
appear
to
him
like
a
bright
star

on

It

<EOS>
the
habitation

empty

rush
forth
with

but
could
learn
nothing
more
than
that
he
have
depart
with
his
whole
household
a
few
hour
before

<EOS>
at
last
it
occur
to
him
that
he
may
obtain
some
information
from
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
and
he
be
about
to
cross
to
the
other
side
of
the
churchyard
,
when
he
be
arrest
by
a
simultaneous
cry
of
horror
from
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
look
upwards
,
for
there
he
see
the
general
gaze
direct
,
he
perceive
that
the
scaffolding
around
the
roof
and
tower
of
the
cathedral
have
kindle
,
and
be
envelop
the
whole
upper
part
of
the

in
a
network
of
fire

likewise
burst
from

from
the
lofty

window
below
it
,
flicker
and
play
round
the
hoary
buttress
,
and
disturb
the
numerous
jackdaw
that

in
their
timeworn
crevice
,
and
now
fly
scream
forth
.
<EOS>
as
Leonard
gaze
at
the
summit
of
the
tower
,
be
discern
through
the
circle
eddy
of
smoke
that
envelop
it
the
figure
of
Solomon
Eagle
stand
on
the
top
of
the
battlement
and
wave
his
staff
,
and
almost
fancy
he
could
hear
his
voice
.
<EOS>
after
remain
in
this
perilous
situation
for
some
minute
,
as
if
to
raise
anxiety
for
his
safety
to
the
high
pitch
,
the
enthusiast
spring
upon
a
portion
of
the
scaffolding
that

only
partly
consume

and
descend
from
pole
to
pole
,
regardless
whether

with
marvellous
swiftness

and
apparently
without
injury
.
<EOS>
alight
on
the
roof
,
he
speed
to
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
fane
,
and
there
commence
his
exhortation
to
the
crowd
below

<EOS>
It
now
become
evident
also
,
from
the
strange
roaring
noise

from
the
tower
,
that
the
flame

descend
the
spiral
staircase
,
and
force
their
way
through
some
secret
door
or
passage
to
the
roof
.
<EOS>
determine
to
take
one
last
survey
of
the
interior
of

which
he

through
the

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
They
appear
to
be
carry
a
large
chest
,
but
Leonard
be
too
much
interested
in
what
be
occur
to
pay
much
attention
to
them
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
few
person

alone
within

at
such
a
moment

<EOS>
Their
situation
,
though
perilous
,
be
one
that

thrilling
and
sublime
emotion

multitude

with
the
roaring
of

from
without

while
the
fierce
glare
of
the
flame
light
up
the
paint
window
at
the
head
of
the
choir
with
unwonted
splendour
.
<EOS>
Overhead
be
hear
a
hollow
rumble
noise
like
that
of
distant
thunder
,
which
continue
for
a
short
time
,
while
fluid
stream
of
smoke
creep
through
the
mighty
rafter
of
the
roof
,
and
gradually
fill
the
whole
interior
of
the
fabric
with
vapour
.
<EOS>
suddenly
a
tremendous
cracking
be
hear
,
as
if
the
whole
pile
be
tumble
in
piece
.
<EOS>
so
appalling
be
this
sound
,
that
Leonard
and
his
companion
would
have
flee
,
but
they
be
completely
transfix
by
terror
.
 
<EOS>
while
they
be
in
this
state
,
the
flame
,
which

long

burn
in
secret
,
burst
through
the
roof
at
the
other
end
of
the
choir
,
and
instantaneously
spread
over
its
whole
expanse

<EOS>
at
this
juncture

northern
gallery

up

Leonard

Solomon

"
My

--
and

be
utterly

"
 
<EOS>
the
vociferation
of
the
enthusiast

by
a
piercing
cry
from

moment

porter
,
Leonard
shout
to
him
,
and
the
poor
fellow

towards
him
.
<EOS>
at
this
juncture
,
a
strange
hissing
sound
be
hear
,
as
if
a
heavy
shower
of
rain
be
descend
upon
the
roof
,
and
through
the
yawn
gap
over
the
choir
there
pour
a
stream
of
molten
lead
of
silvery
brightness
.
<EOS>
nothing
can
be

yet
terrible
cascade

presently
in

<EOS>
Leonard
and
his
companion
now
turn
to
fly
,
but
they
have
scarcely

a
few
pace
when

burst
open

,
but
not
without

accidental
plash
from

no

<EOS>
for

time

they
proceed
along

passage

push
the
chest

I

you
be

echo
Judith

force
a
derisive

turn

of
what

"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay

I
do
not

chowle

only
I

what

cry
Judith

with
a
fierceness
that
effectually
insure
obedience
to
her
command

<EOS>
Chowles
again
have
recourse
to
the
bottle
,
and
derive
a
false
courage
from
it
,
as
before
,
commence
skip
about
the
chamber
in
his
usual
fantastical
manner
.
<EOS>
Judith
,
do
not
attempt
to
check
him
,
but
remain
with
her
chin
rest
upon
her
hand
gaze
at
him

<EOS>
"
do
you
remember
the
Dance
of
Death

Judith

he
cry
,
execute
some
of
the
wild
flourish
he
have
then
perform
,

and
how
I
surprise
the
Earl
of
Rochester
and
his
crew
?

<EOS>
"
I
do

Judith

sternly
,

I
hope
we
may
not
soon
have
to
perform
that
dance
together
in
reality

"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
merry
night

Chowles

who
do
not
hear
what
she
say
,
"
a
right
merry
night

so
to

night
shall
be

overhead

<EOS>
and
he
take
another
long
pull
at
the
flask
.
<EOS>
"
I
breathe
freely
now

"
<EOS>
and
he
continue
his
wild
flourish
until
he
be
completely
exhausted
.
<EOS>
He
then
sit
down
by
Judith
,
and
would
have
twine
his
bony
arm
round
her
neck
,
but
she
roughly
repulse
him
.
 
<EOS>
with
a
growl
of
displeasure
,
he
then
proceed
to
open
and
examine
the
various
bag
,
chest
,
and
casket
pile
upon
the
floor
,
and
the
sight
of
their
content
so
excited
Judith
,
that
shake
off
her
misgiving
,
she
join
him
,
and
they
continue
opening
case
after
case
,
glut
their
greedy
eye
,
until
Chowles
become
aware
that
the
vault
be
fill
with
smoke

<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
perceive
this

he
start

his
foot

arise
,

look
show

share
in
his
apprehension

"
We
must
not

Chowles
;

and
yet

he
add
,
with
an
agonised
look
at
the
rich
store

snatch
up
two

three

the
most
valuable
casket

<EOS>
while
Chowles
gaze
at
the
heap
before
him

hesitate
what
to
select

the
smoke
grow
so
dense
around
them

seize
his
arm
,
and
drag
him
away

I
come

cry

snatch
up
a
bag
of
gold

They
then
thread
the
narrow
passage

Judith
lead
the
way
and
bear
the
light
.
<EOS>
the
smoke
grow
thick
and
thick
as
they
advance
;
but
regardless
of
this
,
they
hurry
to
the
secret
door

to
the
charnel

Judith
touch
the
spring
,

as
she
do
so

a
sheet

burst
in

chowle
dash
pass
her
,
and
with
great
presence
of
mind
shut
the
door

exclude
the
flame

They
then
hastily
retrace
their
step
,
feel

not

be
lose

would
escape

the
air
in

thicken

smoke

have
become
so
hot

could
scarcely
breathe

add

to

hear
the

awful
cracking

she
rush
towards

threaten

with
instant
destruction

the
two
wretch
continue
their
strife

advantage

when
a
most
terrific
crash

hot

start
to

advance
a

up

down

but
this
only
show
him
how
vain

his
hope

<EOS>
It
be
with

that

,
now
clamber
over
heap
of
smouldering
ashe
,
now
pass
by
some
topple
wall

which

with
a
terrific
crash
after

an
immense
pile
of
blacken
rafter
;
but
he
at
length

Fleet
Bridge
,
where
he
pause
to
gaze
at
the
scene
of
devastation
around
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
a
melancholy
sight
,
and
draw
tear
to
his
eye
.
<EOS>
the
ravage
of
the
fire
be
almost
inconceivable
.
<EOS>
great
beam
be
burn
to
charcoal
--
stone
calcine
,
and
as
white
as
snow
,
and
such
wall
and
tower
as
be
leave
stand
be
so
damaged
that
their
instant
fall
be
to
be
expect
.
<EOS>
the
very
water
in
the
well
and
fountain
be
boil
,
and
even
the
muddy
Fleet
send
forth
a
hot
steam
.
<EOS>
the
fire
still
linger
in
the
low
part
of
many
habitation
,
especially
where
wine
,
spirit
,
or
inflammable
good
have
be
keep

and
these
"
vorago
of
subterranean
cellar
,
"
<EOS>
as
Evelyn
term
them
,
still
emit
flame
,
together
with
a
prodigious
smoke
and
stench

<EOS>
undismaye
by
the
danger
of
the
path
he
have
to
traverse
,
the
young
man
ascend
Ludgate

hill

still
encounter
the
same
devastation

pass
through
the

remain
perfect
,
approach
what

once
be
Saint

's
Cathedral
.
<EOS>
mount
a
heap
of
rubbish
at
the
end
of
Ludgate
street
,
he
gaze
at
the
mighty
ruin
,
which
look
more
like
the
remain
of
a
city
than
those
of
a
single
edifice
.
 
<EOS>
the
solid
wall
and
buttress
be
split
and
rent
asunder
;
enormous
stone
be
splinter
and
calcine
by
the
heat
;
and
vast
flake
have
scale
from
off
the
pillar
,
give
them
a
hoary
and
almost
ghostly
appearance
.
<EOS>
Its
enormous
extent
be
now
for
the
first
time
clearly
see
,
and
,
strange
to
say
it
look
twice
as
large
in
ruin
as
when
entire
.
<EOS>
the
central
tower
be
still
stand
,
but
chip
,
break
,
and
calcine
,
like
the
rest
of
the
structure
,
by
the
vehement
heat
of
the
flame
.
<EOS>
part
of
the
roof

in
its
fall
,
break
through
the
solid
floor
of
the
choir
,
which

immense
thickness

<EOS>
the
portico

erect
by
Inigo
Jones

and
which
find
so
much
favour
in
Evelyn
's
eye
,
that
he
describe
it
as
"
comparable
to
any
in
Europe
,
"
and
particularly
deplore
its
loss
,
share
the
fate
of
the
rest
of
the
building
--
<EOS>
the
only
part
leave
uninjured
be
the
architrave
,
the
inscription
on
which
be
undefaced
.
 
<EOS>
have
satiate
himself
with
this
sad
but
striking
prospect
,
the
young
man
,
with
some
toil
and
trouble
,
cross
the
churchyard
,
and
gain
Cheapside
,
where
a
yet
more
terrific
scene
of
devastation
than
that
which
he
have
previously
witness
burst
upon
him
.
<EOS>
on
the
right
of
London
Bridge
,
which
he
could
discern
through
the
chasm
of
the
house
,
and
almost
to
the
Tower
,
be
nothing
but
ruin
,
while
a
similar
waste
lie
on
the
left
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
terrible
change
that
have
be
work
in
the
aspect
of
the
ruin
city
,
that
if
the
young
man
have
not
have
some
mark
to
guide
him
,
he
would
not
have
know
where
he
be
.
<EOS>
the
tower
and
ruin
wall
of
Saint
Peter

Church
point
out
to
him
the
entrance
to
wood
-
street
,
and
,
enter
it
,
he
traverse
it
with
considerable
difficulty
--
for
the
narrow
thoroughfare
be
much
full
of
rubbish
,
and
much
less
free
from
smoke
and
fiery
vapour
,
than
the
wide
--
until
he
reach
a
part
of
it
with
which
he
have
once
be
well
acquaint
.
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
how
change
be
that
familiar
spot
.
<EOS>
the
house
he
seek
be
a
mere
heap
of
ruin
.
<EOS>
while
gaze
at
them
,
he
hear
a
voice
behind
him
,
and
turn
,
behold
Mr.

their
way
through
what

<EOS>
a
warm
greeting

and
Mr.

gaze
for
some
time
in
silence
upon
the
wreck
of
his
dwelling

<EOS>
tear
force
themselves
into
his
eye

and
his
companion
be
no

moved

<EOS>
as
he
turn

he
observe
to
the
young

with
some
severity
:
 
<EOS>
"
